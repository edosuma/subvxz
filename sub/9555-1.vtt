Come on, everybody.
No dilly dallying.

01:26.019 --> 01:28.613
(gasps) Howard,
do you have the train tickets?

01:28.722 --> 01:30.417
Yes, Marion, I have them.

01:30.524 --> 01:34.154
And I've got your motion
sickness pills and your Lysol.

01:34.261 --> 01:36.355
What have you got
in these bags, anyway?

01:36.463 --> 01:38.363
Just light summer wear.

01:38.465 --> 01:40.559
For how many summers, Marion?

01:42.169 --> 01:43.830
Oh! Oh!

01:43.937 --> 01:45.200
Shoot!

01:45.305 --> 01:46.898
Oh. Thanks, Dad.

01:47.007 --> 01:48.441
- Oh, boy. No, uh, Richard.
- What?

01:48.542 --> 01:50.738
Howard, this is no time
to be playing basketball.

01:50.844 --> 01:54.337
Uncle Ben is in serious trouble,
and we cannot miss that train.

01:54.448 --> 01:56.542
Playing?
Mom, I almost broke my...

01:56.650 --> 01:58.914
You're right. You're right.

01:59.019 --> 02:00.680
Marion, will you please relax?

02:00.787 --> 02:02.915
Now, we promised
your Uncle Ben we'd be there

02:03.023 --> 02:05.082
in time to help him
run the dude ranch.

02:05.192 --> 02:07.991
Well, we have to be there when
the guests arrive on Sunday.

02:08.095 --> 02:10.928
The train will be there
with time to spare!

02:11.031 --> 02:12.396
What if it has a flat?

02:12.499 --> 02:14.024
-(thudding)
- Oh, I'm sorry, Howard.

02:14.134 --> 02:16.159
- I just get so nervous.
-(thudding)

02:18.205 --> 02:21.072
No, Richard,
that's Joanie's camp trunk.

02:21.174 --> 02:24.337
- It stays.
- It stays?!

02:24.444 --> 02:26.242
(Richie chuckles)

02:26.346 --> 02:28.337
I hate traveling.

02:29.883 --> 02:32.045
Joanie, will you get a move on?

02:32.152 --> 02:34.246
JOANIE:
My nails aren't dry yet!

02:34.354 --> 02:37.016
Well, you tell that
to the train when you miss it.

02:37.124 --> 02:39.024
Oh, Howard,
she's just at that age.

02:39.126 --> 02:40.821
Yeah.

02:40.927 --> 02:42.918
Hey, I'm back, huh?

02:44.431 --> 02:45.421
You're moving out?

02:45.532 --> 02:47.057
I'm very sad.

02:47.167 --> 02:49.431
No, no, Fonzie,
we're not moving out.

02:49.536 --> 02:50.765
Oh, Arthur, it's just terrible.

02:50.871 --> 02:52.930
My Uncle Ben is having trouble
with his neighbor.

02:53.040 --> 02:54.166
He must be a terrible man.

02:54.274 --> 02:56.299
Uncle Ben called him
a "sidewinder."

02:56.410 --> 02:58.003
- Whoa.
- He wants us all to be there.

02:58.111 --> 02:59.408
He needs us. He's family.

02:59.513 --> 03:00.639
He's a Kelp.

03:00.747 --> 03:02.215
Translation?

03:02.315 --> 03:05.376
Her Uncle Ben is in trouble,
and we're all going to Colorado

03:05.485 --> 03:07.351
to help him run his dude ranch.

03:07.454 --> 03:09.616
Have a great time.

03:09.723 --> 03:11.987
Well, actually, Fonzie,
Uncle Ben's wire said

03:12.092 --> 03:14.424
that he could use
all the help he could get.

03:14.528 --> 03:17.554
The whole family's going,
and so are Ralph, Potsie and Al.

03:17.664 --> 03:19.655
They're gonna meet us
down at the station.

03:19.766 --> 03:21.291
And we were wondering if...

03:21.401 --> 03:23.165
I get your drift.

03:23.270 --> 03:24.863
And I'll be more
than happy to help you.

03:24.971 --> 03:26.166
I'm gonna be
in the neighborhood.

03:26.273 --> 03:28.298
I'm at a bike rally in Arizona,
which is just a...

03:28.408 --> 03:29.967
around
the corner from Colorado.

03:30.077 --> 03:31.738
- You understand?
- Oh, Arthur, good.

03:31.845 --> 03:34.712
You're gonna have so much fun
riding the horses.

03:34.815 --> 03:36.283
Hold it!

03:36.383 --> 03:39.978
Horses? I don't ride anything
I can't put gas into, you know?

03:40.087 --> 03:41.987
But like
Roy Rogers used to say:

03:42.089 --> 03:44.751
♪ Happy trails to you. ♪

04:09.750 --> 04:11.912

04:20.994 --> 04:22.985
(happy shouts,
indistinct chatter)

04:33.406 --> 04:35.534
The driver's gonna take
the luggage up to the house.

04:35.642 --> 04:39.977
As far as the eye can see, this
all belongs to the Kelp family.

04:40.080 --> 04:41.206
(horn honking)

04:41.314 --> 04:43.806
- POTSIE: Nice car! Yeah!
- MARION: Look at this!

04:43.917 --> 04:45.715
- Oh, look at this. -Beautiful!
- Oh. -That's wonderful.

04:45.819 --> 04:47.253
- Howdy, folks.
- POTSIE: Gorgeous car.

04:47.354 --> 04:48.913
- Gorgeous.
- Look over there...

04:49.022 --> 04:50.649
Welcome to the Bar A Ranch.

04:50.757 --> 04:51.690
- RICHIE: Thank you.
- MAN: Which one of you is

04:51.792 --> 04:52.850
Howard Cunningham?

04:52.959 --> 04:54.017
Hi, there.
I'm Howard Cunningham.

04:54.127 --> 04:55.390
Oh, nice to meet you.

04:55.495 --> 04:58.863
I'm H.R. Buchanan,
your Uncle Ben's neighbor.

04:58.965 --> 05:01.434
You're the sidewinder
Uncle Ben wrote about.

05:01.535 --> 05:02.866
(laughing)

05:02.969 --> 05:05.199
Yeah, that's Uncle Ben.

05:05.305 --> 05:07.501
He's a colorful old fellow.

05:07.607 --> 05:10.770
Well, uh, what can we do
for you, sir?

05:10.877 --> 05:12.572
Oh, just here to welcome you.

05:12.679 --> 05:14.738
- Oh, isn't that nice?
- H.R.: Yeah, and let you know

05:14.848 --> 05:16.338
that I'm gonna have the law

05:16.449 --> 05:18.781
throw you off the ranch
in five days.

05:18.885 --> 05:20.683
That's not nice.

05:20.787 --> 05:22.118
Hey, wait a minute--
you can't do that.

05:22.222 --> 05:23.553
They promised us
a free vacation.

05:23.657 --> 05:25.216
- Yeah! -Yeah!
- Yeah.

05:25.325 --> 05:26.656
Oh, yes, I can.

05:26.760 --> 05:28.922
See, I hold a note
on Uncle Ben's ranch,

05:29.029 --> 05:31.726
and it's due noon... Friday.

05:31.832 --> 05:35.632
Your uncle didn't mention that
in the wire, did he, Marion?

05:35.735 --> 05:38.636
Well, he wanted to save
the money to help pay the note.

05:38.738 --> 05:40.228
He sent the wire collect.

05:40.340 --> 05:42.866
Do you have the money or not?

05:42.976 --> 05:45.035
Well, w-we, uh...
we-we don't have it now,

05:45.145 --> 05:46.738
but, uh, we will have it
by Friday.

05:46.847 --> 05:48.337
- Yes... right...
-(overlapping chatter)

05:48.448 --> 05:49.711
JOANIE:
We'll have it by Friday.

05:49.816 --> 05:53.480
Oh, ho, ho, you might as well
turn over the ranch now.

05:53.587 --> 05:58.024
It's obvious you people
are not capable of running it.

05:58.124 --> 05:59.785
(H.R. laughs)

05:59.893 --> 06:02.419
My dad took a failing
hardware store,

06:02.529 --> 06:04.293
and he turned it
into a successful business.

06:04.397 --> 06:05.523
That's right.

06:05.632 --> 06:06.565
- RICHIE: Isn't that right?
- JOANIE: Yeah!

06:06.666 --> 06:07.758
Well, there's more

06:07.868 --> 06:09.427
to running a ranch
than selling curtain rods.

06:09.536 --> 06:11.129
Now, look here, Mr. Sidewinder.

06:11.238 --> 06:13.900
Nobody pushes
a Cunningham around.

06:14.007 --> 06:15.168
- Yeah! -POTSIE: You better
believe it! That's right.

06:15.275 --> 06:17.266
And we'll run the ranch
and pay the note.

06:17.377 --> 06:18.469
- RALPH: Yeah.
- Yeah. -Right.

06:18.578 --> 06:19.636
Well, how are you going
to do that, young lady?

06:19.746 --> 06:20.907
I hired all your Wranglers.

06:21.014 --> 06:22.607
All except one.

06:22.716 --> 06:24.206
(horse neighs)

06:24.317 --> 06:27.582
An ornery wrangler...
named Thunder.

06:27.687 --> 06:29.621
(horse neighing,
dog barking)

06:29.723 --> 06:31.282
Well, you haven't
even seen ornery

06:31.391 --> 06:34.088
till you've run up against
the Cunninghams, bucko.

06:34.194 --> 06:35.753
And Howard Cunningham
does not quit.

06:35.862 --> 06:37.159
- That's right.
- That's right.

06:37.264 --> 06:38.891
- That's right.
- And neither does Al Delvecchio.

06:38.999 --> 06:40.194
- No. -No.
- Yeah.

06:40.300 --> 06:41.665
- Neither does Potsie Weber.
- That's right.

06:41.768 --> 06:43.429
Ah...

06:43.536 --> 06:45.527
Hank? Hmm?

06:48.775 --> 06:50.869
I'd like some time
to think about it.

06:55.048 --> 06:56.345
(car starts)

06:59.352 --> 07:01.946
(horn honking)

07:02.055 --> 07:03.284
And stay off!

07:03.390 --> 07:05.290
Did you see the horns
on that car?

07:05.392 --> 07:07.326
- Richard . ..
- Right. Stay off!

07:07.427 --> 07:09.759
Well, where's Uncle Ben?

07:09.863 --> 07:12.389
Looks like there's somebody
over there by the pool.

07:12.499 --> 07:15.400
RICHIE:
That's not Uncle Ben.

07:16.870 --> 07:20.397
Potsie, do my eyes deceive me?

07:22.742 --> 07:24.801
Will you look
at that lovely in the pool?

07:24.911 --> 07:26.379
Must be a mirage.

07:26.479 --> 07:28.447
Maybe I can kiss her
before she fades.

07:28.548 --> 07:29.777
Yeah.

07:33.320 --> 07:36.517
Hiya, baby.

07:36.623 --> 07:38.148
(group shouting, screaming)

07:38.258 --> 07:39.885
- Hey, what are you doing?
- Young lady!

07:39.993 --> 07:41.392
- What was that all about?
- What did you do that for?

07:41.494 --> 07:42.984
Well, why did you throw him
in the pool?

07:43.096 --> 07:44.222
POTSIE:
Yeah, he's not that bad.

07:44.331 --> 07:45.821
Well, you don't work for H.R.?

07:45.932 --> 07:47.297
- No.
- No, we're the Cunninghams.

07:47.400 --> 07:49.266
Oh... well, you startled me.

07:49.369 --> 07:51.804
There's been so much trouble
with H.R. lately.

07:51.905 --> 07:53.873
Well... you okay?

07:53.974 --> 07:55.305
I'm sorry.

07:55.408 --> 07:57.240
It's a good thing we weren't
on the edge of a cliff.

07:57.344 --> 08:00.075
Well, Ben said you'd be here.
I'm real glad you've arrived.

08:00.180 --> 08:02.376
- Well, where is Ben?
- Why, he's laid up.

08:02.482 --> 08:03.916
It's his back.

08:04.017 --> 08:05.178
- A bull threw him.
- JOANIE: Oh, wow.

08:05.285 --> 08:06.548
Oh, we better go inside,
see how he is.

08:06.653 --> 08:08.018
- Yeah.
- MARION: Aw...

08:09.389 --> 08:11.255
Yeah, I'll-I'll be up there
in just a minute.

08:11.358 --> 08:12.484
L-I want to look around

08:12.592 --> 08:15.061
and try and find
this ornery wrangler, Thunder.

08:15.161 --> 08:17.255
I'm Thunder.

08:17.364 --> 08:19.025
You're Thunder?

08:19.132 --> 08:21.032
Why, you're not ornery.

08:21.134 --> 08:22.067
You're-you're very cute.

08:22.168 --> 08:23.226
Yeah, real cute!

08:23.336 --> 08:24.826
Yeah, but definitely not ornery.

08:24.938 --> 08:25.871
Ornery.

08:25.972 --> 08:26.768
Take my word for it.

08:26.873 --> 08:27.931
Ornery.

08:28.041 --> 08:29.975
Ralph, you can get out
of the pool now.

08:30.076 --> 08:31.202
It's perfectly safe.

08:31.311 --> 08:33.871
I'm sorry, but you surprised me.

08:33.980 --> 08:35.971
You Okay?

08:36.082 --> 08:37.914
Do you give mouth-to-mouth
resuscitation?

08:38.018 --> 08:39.746
Do you want to go back
in the pool?

08:39.852 --> 08:41.548
Not necessary.
I'm breathing well now.

08:41.654 --> 08:43.554
-(Ralph exhales)
- Well, we can gab later.

08:43.655 --> 08:45.954
By the way,
which one of you cook?

08:46.059 --> 08:48.153
Al here owns a restaurant.

08:48.261 --> 08:49.922
Well, uh,
that's as far as we'll go.

08:50.030 --> 08:52.260
Well, the dining area's
over there,

08:52.365 --> 08:53.730
and the kitchen's in the barn.

08:53.833 --> 08:56.131
Al, you think you can
rustle us up some vittles?

08:56.236 --> 08:59.866
Well, I'll try, ma'am, but I've
never rustled a vittle before.

08:59.973 --> 09:01.668
Yeah, that's good.

09:01.775 --> 09:04.267
Well, I guess we ought
to mosey over to the corral,

09:04.377 --> 09:07.938
rope us a tenderfoot
and Cayuse them mavericks.

09:08.048 --> 09:10.847
Uh, I beg your pardon? I didn't
understand a word you said.

09:10.950 --> 09:12.941
Well, I thought that's the way
everybody talked out here.

09:13.053 --> 09:14.612
(laughing):
You're cute.

09:14.721 --> 09:17.247
You don't make much sense,
but you're cute.

09:17.357 --> 09:18.825
(laughs)
I'm cute.

09:18.925 --> 09:21.019
Oh, yeah,
you're real cute, Rich.

09:23.196 --> 09:25.187
(whistles)

09:34.574 --> 09:35.735
RICHIE:
Boy, that's-that's pretty nice.

09:35.842 --> 09:36.968
Got your own horse
and everything.

09:37.077 --> 09:38.545
Yeah.
Hold on, Licorice.

09:38.645 --> 09:40.773
Licorice?!
That's a great horse.

09:40.880 --> 09:42.905
Yeah, but he's got
a sweet tooth, loves licorice.

09:43.016 --> 09:44.711
See you later, boys.

09:44.818 --> 09:46.718
- See you. -So long.
- Bye.

09:46.820 --> 09:49.152
See you.

09:49.255 --> 09:50.745
Sweet tooth.

09:50.857 --> 09:51.847
I love banana splits.

09:51.958 --> 09:53.517
Nobody calls me bananas.

09:53.626 --> 09:56.061
Not to your face.

10:03.503 --> 10:04.902
- POTSIE: Hey, guys, guys.
-(horn toots)

10:05.004 --> 10:06.199
- The bus is coming.
- RICHIE: Oh, good.

10:06.306 --> 10:07.501
- Well, we're ready for 'em.
- POTSIE: Yeah.

10:07.607 --> 10:08.802
RICHIE:
Bring on them dudes.

10:08.908 --> 10:10.774
All right, roll out, and show
these folks a good time.

10:10.877 --> 10:12.072
- Oh, how y'all doing?
- Welcome!

10:12.178 --> 10:14.010
(overlapping chatter)

10:14.114 --> 10:15.707
Howdy, ma'am.
Howdy, partner.

10:15.815 --> 10:16.873
(indistinct,
overlapping chatter)

10:16.983 --> 10:18.144
Welcome to the Bar A.
Good to have you.

10:18.251 --> 10:20.049
Howdy, partner.
Howdy, ma'am.

10:20.153 --> 10:21.848
(indistinct,
overlapping chatter)

10:21.955 --> 10:23.218
- Hi. -Come on, partners
and partettes.

10:23.323 --> 10:25.018
- Oh...
- Okay, Malph.

10:25.125 --> 10:26.320
POTSIE:
It's a big one, Malph.

10:26.426 --> 10:28.019
- RALPH: All right, heavy one.
- Right this way, folks.

10:28.128 --> 10:29.493
- RALPH: All right, guys.
- Welcome. Welcome.

10:29.596 --> 10:31.086
-(indistinct chatter)
- Hi. Hello.

10:31.197 --> 10:33.461
- POTSIE: Here comes another one.
- The bus here already, huh?

10:33.566 --> 10:35.091
Yes, it's guestward ho.

10:35.201 --> 10:36.635
RALPH: Hand me that other one
up there on top.

10:36.736 --> 10:37.897
POTSIE: You got it.
Let me down.

10:38.004 --> 10:39.563
- Did you have a nice talk
with Uncle Ben? -Yeah.

10:39.672 --> 10:41.197
He's pretty worried, Marion.

10:41.307 --> 10:44.004
It seems he got hurt pretty bad
by all the heavy rains

10:44.110 --> 10:46.408
they've had here
for the last two summers.

10:46.513 --> 10:48.106
- Cut his business way down.
- POTSIE: Here comes another one.

10:48.214 --> 10:50.842
- He had to borrow on the ranch.
- Poor Uncle Ben.

10:50.950 --> 10:52.941
We have to make a go of it,
Howard.

10:53.052 --> 10:54.850
Well, we'll do our best.

10:54.954 --> 10:57.389
He's talking
about moving in with us.

10:57.490 --> 10:58.958
Oh?

10:59.058 --> 11:02.619
Well, we'll-we'll make a bedroom
out of your study.

11:02.729 --> 11:04.390
My study?

11:04.497 --> 11:06.022
We'll make it, Marion.

11:06.132 --> 11:07.622
Shouldn't be too bad.

11:09.002 --> 11:10.299
Hey, Malph!

11:10.403 --> 11:11.598
<i>“Mph!</i>

11:11.704 --> 11:13.001
What-what are you doing?!

11:13.106 --> 11:15.302
- Did you dent that bag?
- I'll show you "dent the bag"!

11:15.408 --> 11:16.739
What are you, try...
you're supposed

11:16.843 --> 11:18.333
-to catch 'em, not throw 'em.
- Throw it here...

11:18.444 --> 11:19.377
(Potsie and Ralph yelling)

11:19.479 --> 11:20.378
...in a man's face!

11:20.480 --> 11:22.448
Would you do it right?!

11:22.549 --> 11:23.812
On second thought,
it could be bad.

11:23.917 --> 11:24.907
POTSIE: Why don't you look
what you're doing,

11:25.018 --> 11:26.179
instead of looking at girls?
Come on...

11:26.286 --> 11:27.947
I'm sweating to death up here!

11:35.361 --> 11:40.128
Well, this is the second day,
and so far, so good.

11:40.233 --> 11:42.759
So far, so good?

11:42.869 --> 11:45.338
- Yeah.
- Three horses got loose.

11:45.438 --> 11:47.998
Ralph almost hung himself
trying to hang up the lights.

11:48.107 --> 11:50.132
Al has cooked nothing but beans,

11:50.243 --> 11:52.769
and Potsie dropped all
the sheets in the swimming pool.

11:52.879 --> 11:55.507
Joanie,
it has not been a bed of roses.

11:55.615 --> 11:58.710
Not much different than
a Saturday night at Arnold's.

11:58.818 --> 12:00.217
Yeah, it has been fun,
hasn't it?

12:00.320 --> 12:02.516
Yeah. (giggles)

12:02.622 --> 12:04.681
You know, Joanie,
I was thinking, and...

12:06.092 --> 12:09.687
...uh, I was talking to Dad
and I was saying that I...

12:10.697 --> 12:12.961
...that I thought...

12:13.066 --> 12:16.058
Is that a cloud of dust?

12:17.237 --> 12:20.969
Do you hear the sound
of thundering hoof beats?

12:21.074 --> 12:25.068
- No. No.
- It-it couldn't be.

12:32.252 --> 12:34.050
RICHIE:
It's Fonzie!

12:35.088 --> 12:36.647
Fonz, you made it.

12:36.756 --> 12:38.884
Yeah, you found the ranch
all right.

12:38.992 --> 12:40.482
Well, no problem.

12:40.593 --> 12:43.528
I mean, thanks to my wonderful
Indian guide, Soft Doe.

12:43.630 --> 12:46.531
She helped me
find the ranch,

12:46.633 --> 12:49.864
and I, in turn, helped her
locate my lips.

12:49.969 --> 12:51.801
I deeply appreciate it.

12:51.904 --> 12:53.895
Thank you.

12:56.209 --> 12:59.201
Likewise, I'm sure.

12:59.312 --> 13:01.178
- Uh, do you want some breakfast?
- No, I had some

13:01.281 --> 13:03.306
on the trail there.
Thanks a lot.

13:03.416 --> 13:05.510
On the trail.
Oh, isn't that great?

13:05.618 --> 13:07.177
Eating out in the open,

13:07.287 --> 13:09.312
under a canopy
of the great Western sky?

13:09.422 --> 13:10.480
JOANIE:
Yeah.

13:10.590 --> 13:12.058
Yeah, we ate
at Howard Johnson's.

13:13.760 --> 13:15.660
I love this cowboy life,
you know?

13:15.762 --> 13:16.957
Hey, get along, little dogie.

13:17.063 --> 13:19.361
Heyyy.

13:19.465 --> 13:21.456
Howard Johnson's?

13:34.681 --> 13:36.581
Met any boys yet, Joanie?

13:36.683 --> 13:37.775
Oh, did I?

13:37.884 --> 13:40.182
(chuckles)
You should see the local hunks.

13:40.286 --> 13:42.687
Oh, there was this one guy
delivering hay.

13:42.789 --> 13:45.190
He had arms and shoulders.

13:45.291 --> 13:47.589
- He was... ooh.
- Is that it?

13:47.694 --> 13:51.460
Is that all a guy is to you,
is just arms and shoulders?

13:51.564 --> 13:54.056
Okay.
What do you see in a girl?

13:54.167 --> 13:58.161
Well, I see... uh...

13:58.271 --> 13:59.636
Help me with the sign,
will you?

13:59.739 --> 14:01.764
(chuckles)
Yeah.

14:01.874 --> 14:03.774
Honey, here's
another reservation for four.

14:03.876 --> 14:05.275
Oh, good.

14:05.378 --> 14:06.436
We're building.

14:06.546 --> 14:09.607
But still way short
of what he owes.

14:09.716 --> 14:13.744
Oh, Howard, now, couldn't we
loan Uncle Ben the ranch money?

14:13.853 --> 14:15.753
Sweetheart,
I've given him all I could.

14:15.855 --> 14:18.552
Now, the rest of my cash
is tied up in inventory.

14:18.658 --> 14:19.921
Don't worry about it.

14:20.026 --> 14:20.925
We'll make it.

14:21.027 --> 14:24.463
Oh, Howard, you do have spunk.

14:27.533 --> 14:29.934
- RICHIE: Oh, hi, Thunder.
- HOWARD: Hi. -Howdy.

14:30.036 --> 14:32.596
Did somebody put a motorcycle
in one of the stalls?

14:32.705 --> 14:33.968
Oh, that's Fonzie's.

14:34.073 --> 14:35.199
Fonzie?

14:35.308 --> 14:37.140
- He's a friend of ours.
- Oh.

14:37.243 --> 14:38.301
Yeah, well, that's too bad.

14:38.411 --> 14:41.346
You should see
what the cow just did to it.

14:43.316 --> 14:45.216
Yep. Oh, there's dents
all over it.

14:45.318 --> 14:48.049
But, uh, I just hammered 'em
right back out.

14:48.154 --> 14:49.815
RICHIE:
Oh, that's great. Listen,

14:49.922 --> 14:51.720
-how we doing, Thunder?
- Well,

14:51.824 --> 14:53.656
-so far, so good.
- Yeah?

14:53.760 --> 14:56.252
- Well, except...
- Except what?

14:56.362 --> 14:57.659
Well...

14:57.764 --> 15:01.667
every year about this time,
the Bar A stages a rodeo.

15:01.768 --> 15:02.997
It's big business,

15:03.102 --> 15:05.799
and Wranglers from
all the ranches around compete.

15:05.905 --> 15:07.395
It's tradition.

15:07.507 --> 15:10.238
The guests
really look forward to it.

15:12.078 --> 15:13.807
(sighs)
But this year...

15:13.913 --> 15:16.473
But this year you're thinking
that us dudes can't handle it?

15:16.582 --> 15:20.018
Well, I forget... (chuckles)
you folks just don't quit.

15:20.119 --> 15:21.609
Oh, boy.

15:21.721 --> 15:24.554
Broncing hunks,
roping hunks, wrangling hunks.

15:24.657 --> 15:26.557
Oh, I just love rodeos.

15:26.659 --> 15:29.526
- HOWARD: Joanie.
- Behave yourself, Joanie.

15:29.629 --> 15:31.859
Well, if the people want
a rodeo,

15:31.964 --> 15:33.591
the rodeo is on.

15:33.699 --> 15:36.600
- Yeah.
- Oh, boy! You people don't quit!

15:36.702 --> 15:39.603
Oh, Mrs. Cunningham,
you're just like your Uncle Ben.

15:39.705 --> 15:43.005
(whoops)
I'll go spread the word!

15:43.109 --> 15:44.338
Isn't she a lovely girl?

15:44.444 --> 15:46.208
Oh, yeah.
And great muscles.

15:46.312 --> 15:48.144
Ha, ha, ha.

15:48.247 --> 15:50.807
I'm talking about wrangling,
you know, uh,

15:50.917 --> 15:52.112
throwing guys
into swimming pools.

15:52.218 --> 15:53.947
Mm-hmm.

15:54.053 --> 15:55.714
All right, come on, fellas.
Just follow me.

15:55.822 --> 15:56.880
We're coming,
we're coming.

15:56.989 --> 15:59.321
Come on, Potsie. This way.
Oh, hi, gang.

15:59.425 --> 16:00.984
Look what I got.

16:01.093 --> 16:02.993
It's a whole side of beef,
and I'm gonna cook it

16:03.095 --> 16:05.996
like the cowboys did in
the old days, over an open fire.

16:06.098 --> 16:07.623
- Hey, Al?
- Yeah.

16:07.733 --> 16:09.326
This is heavy.

16:09.435 --> 16:10.994
Oh! Well, come on.
This way.

16:11.103 --> 16:13.197
Couldn't we have bought it live
and walked it over?

16:13.306 --> 16:15.400
- Come on, guys. Just keep
moving. -I'm moving! I'm moving!

16:15.508 --> 16:19.001
I should have been a vegetarian.

16:19.111 --> 16:20.135
Here it is!

16:20.246 --> 16:21.543
Okay, Pots,
get it up over there, will you?

16:21.647 --> 16:22.546
Ow!

16:22.648 --> 16:23.672
Way out here?

16:23.783 --> 16:25.217
Why couldn't you
just cook it inside?

16:25.318 --> 16:28.219
Did you ever try stuffing
one of these in an oven?

16:28.321 --> 16:31.347
- Good boy...
- Yeah ...

16:31.457 --> 16:34.518
All right, Al, set up.
Turn on the fire.

16:34.627 --> 16:35.924
- Yeah.
- Turn on?

16:36.028 --> 16:37.792
You guys got
to go hunt up some wood.

16:37.897 --> 16:39.331
Where do we get that?

16:39.432 --> 16:42.163
That's why they threw him out
of the Cub Scouts.

16:44.637 --> 16:46.036
RICHIE (over speaker):
Good morning!

16:46.138 --> 16:49.665
This is your social director,
Old Smiling Cunningham.

16:49.775 --> 16:51.402
I'm here to tell you
about today's fun.

16:51.511 --> 16:52.740
But, first, a commercial:

16:52.845 --> 16:54.677
Don't forget
about the big rodeo tomorrow.

16:54.780 --> 16:56.942
There'll be
a special guest star--

16:57.049 --> 16:59.279
Diablo, a killer bull.

16:59.385 --> 17:01.376
(feedback squeals)

17:03.523 --> 17:06.288
We're gonna start off our first
full day of activities here

17:06.392 --> 17:08.884
at the Bar A Ranch
with a trail ride.

17:08.994 --> 17:11.896
All those interested, please
mosey down to the main hall.

17:11.998 --> 17:13.762
Thank you.

17:13.866 --> 17:15.425
- Fonz.
- Yeah.

17:15.535 --> 17:17.435
You gonna go with us
on the trail ride?

17:17.537 --> 17:18.834
- Horses?
- Yeah.

17:18.938 --> 17:20.929
Whoa.

17:22.842 --> 17:23.775
All right, listen up,

17:23.876 --> 17:26.310
all buckettes
within hearing distance.

17:26.412 --> 17:27.503
(dog barking)

17:27.613 --> 17:29.081
(over P.A.): The first
Fonzarelli nature walk

17:29.181 --> 17:31.673
is taking place right now.
Grab hold of your leader.

17:31.784 --> 17:33.274
- Let's go.
-(women squealing)

17:35.988 --> 17:37.217
All right, don't wrinkle
the leather, girls.

17:37.323 --> 17:39.018
Don't ruin the leather.
Horses?

17:39.125 --> 17:41.958
Is he talking horses?
(laughing)

17:45.565 --> 17:48.557
He can even do it
over a loudspeaker.

17:55.741 --> 17:57.300
Go on through, folks.

17:57.410 --> 18:00.004
Trail goes right on out
that way.

18:03.449 --> 18:06.851
THUNDER:
Just follow the trail, folks.

18:06.953 --> 18:08.580
Whoa.

18:08.688 --> 18:10.918
- Tired?
- No.

18:11.023 --> 18:13.014
No, I was just admiring
the scenery.

18:13.125 --> 18:15.924
THUNDER: Yep.
It's one of my favorite spots.

18:16.028 --> 18:17.325
Licorice and I come here
quite often.

18:17.430 --> 18:19.091
It's beautiful, all right.

18:19.198 --> 18:21.690
You know, there's an Indian
legend about this spot.

18:21.801 --> 18:25.135
An Indian princess promised to
wait here for her brave

18:25.237 --> 18:27.467
until he returned
from a buffalo hunt.

18:27.573 --> 18:30.270
(sighs)
But he never returned,

18:30.376 --> 18:34.040
and this pond was formed
by her tears.

18:34.146 --> 18:36.274
Whew. Sad story.

18:36.382 --> 18:39.010
Yep. Well, now lovers
come here together.

18:39.118 --> 18:41.018
And if it's a true love,

18:41.120 --> 18:44.351
they say you can hear
that Indian princess crying.

18:44.457 --> 18:45.822
What's it sound like?

18:45.925 --> 18:47.120
I don't know.

18:47.226 --> 18:48.625
I never heard it before.

18:48.728 --> 18:52.392
But they say it sounds something
like the whistling wind.

18:52.498 --> 18:54.728
-(bird squawking)
- What was that?

18:54.834 --> 18:56.928
Oh, just a bird, Richie.

18:57.036 --> 18:59.266
Oh. Yeah.

18:59.372 --> 19:01.670
Wow, we better, uh,
catch up with the others.

19:01.774 --> 19:03.640
- Yeah, come on, Rich.
- Yeah.

19:08.748 --> 19:10.773
That's it, keep your right hand
down a little bit.

19:10.883 --> 19:13.511
You got it.

19:13.619 --> 19:15.383
Hey, you're doing
real good, Joanie.

19:15.488 --> 19:17.320
JOANIE:
How's this?

19:17.423 --> 19:18.982
PHIL:
Great.

19:19.091 --> 19:20.252
(Joanie giggles)

19:20.359 --> 19:23.385
PHIL:
Hang on, now.

19:23.496 --> 19:25.260
Yeah, that's it.
Sit up a little more straight.

19:25.364 --> 19:26.490
- Keep your toes in.
- Oh...

19:26.599 --> 19:28.226
You're teaching me
real good, Phil.

19:28.334 --> 19:30.302
Aw, you can do it yourself.
Looks good.

19:30.403 --> 19:31.962
You're doing great.

19:33.472 --> 19:37.636
Boy, you sure are
a good teacher, Phil.

19:37.743 --> 19:41.907
Aw, shucks, there's nothing
to it with a girl like you.

19:42.014 --> 19:43.948
Oh! Oh, uh, there's
my mom and dad.

19:44.050 --> 19:45.211
I'll be right back, okay?

19:45.317 --> 19:47.684
- Oh, okay.
- Okay.

19:47.787 --> 19:48.913
- Hi, Mom and Dad.
- Hi.

19:49.021 --> 19:50.420
Phil taught me how to ride.

19:50.523 --> 19:51.513
Phil?

19:51.624 --> 19:53.615
Howdy, ma'am; sir.

19:53.726 --> 19:56.889
Oh, yeah, he's just a local boy.

19:56.996 --> 19:58.794
You already know how to ride.

19:58.898 --> 20:02.232
Yeah, but he doesn't know that.
Shh.

20:02.334 --> 20:04.860
She not only grew taller
at summer camp,

20:04.970 --> 20:06.961
she grew smarter.

20:15.681 --> 20:17.979
Looks like we got company.

20:22.521 --> 20:23.886
What are you doing here, bucko?

20:23.989 --> 20:25.684
I heard there was a rodeo on,

20:25.791 --> 20:28.590
and came over
to enter some of my boys.

20:28.694 --> 20:30.423
That's fine, that'll be, uh,

20:30.529 --> 20:32.793
an entry fee of $10
per person.

20:32.898 --> 20:34.764
(chuckles)

20:34.867 --> 20:36.892
Oh, it's Worth it

20:37.002 --> 20:39.630
just to see
some of you tenderfeet

20:39.739 --> 20:42.037
try and bumble through a rodeo.

20:42.141 --> 20:43.768
(laughs)

20:43.876 --> 20:47.278
Here you are, sonny.

20:47.379 --> 20:49.973
Now that that's taken care of,

20:50.082 --> 20:51.777
I think you fellas better mosey.

20:51.884 --> 20:54.478
- Mosey?
-(men laugh)

20:54.587 --> 20:56.419
I just thought
some of my boys and I might

20:56.522 --> 20:57.853
take a little dip
in your pool.

20:57.957 --> 20:59.288
You mind?

20:59.391 --> 21:01.155
- Only one thing stopping you.
- What's that?

21:01.260 --> 21:03.490
- Me.
- And me.

21:03.596 --> 21:05.360
-(scoffing chuckle)
- FONZIE: Hey.

21:07.399 --> 21:10.300
Hey, don't forget about me.
Whoa.

21:10.402 --> 21:12.029
Howdy, Fonz.

21:12.138 --> 21:13.037
Hey.

21:13.139 --> 21:14.732
Why don't you fill me in, Red?

21:14.840 --> 21:16.672
All right. It all started
when we got here.

21:16.776 --> 21:18.870
Well, he's got a Cadillac
with horns on it.

21:18.978 --> 21:21.948
Uh, something about a paper
and we owe him money.

21:22.047 --> 21:24.482
He's a sidewinder, Fonz, we're
trying to get him out of here.

21:24.583 --> 21:27.780
We'll leave
when we feel like it.

21:27.887 --> 21:29.719
Well, I certainly hope
that you feel like it,

21:29.822 --> 21:31.153
'cause your horses
are gonna leave.

21:31.257 --> 21:32.281
(Snaps fingers)

21:32.391 --> 21:35.088
-(horse whinnies)
- We'll meet again!

21:35.194 --> 21:36.992
(Richie and Thunder laughing)

21:37.096 --> 21:38.825
How did he do that?

21:38.931 --> 21:41.161
They had to be female horses.

21:41.267 --> 21:42.860
Well, I'll be over
helping the guests.

21:42.968 --> 21:44.265
Excuse me.

21:44.370 --> 21:45.269
Whoa, nice to meet you, too.

21:45.371 --> 21:46.361
Yeah. Great.

21:50.442 --> 21:52.968
You meet her on the trail
or something like that?

21:53.078 --> 21:54.637
No. Her name is Thunder.

21:54.747 --> 21:56.237
She's a wrangler
here at the ranch.

21:56.348 --> 21:58.248
Well, there must be
something to this, uh,

21:58.350 --> 21:59.442
ranch life, you know?

21:59.552 --> 22:01.350
- Yeah, there is.
- Hey.

22:01.453 --> 22:03.717
You ride into any sunsets,
you know?

22:03.823 --> 22:05.791
Sunsets?

22:05.891 --> 22:07.188
Oh.
(chuckles)

22:07.293 --> 22:10.092
No, Fonz, no... we had
one pretty good conversation.

22:10.196 --> 22:11.857
Well look, I don't want
to interfere here,

22:11.964 --> 22:14.331
I mean, if you want to put
your brand on this filly...

22:14.433 --> 22:16.197
Hey, listen to me,
I'm talking like a cowboy.

22:16.302 --> 22:19.328
I'm dressed like a cowboy,
I feel like a cowboy.

22:19.438 --> 22:21.873
No, Fonz, no, I...
We're just friends.

22:21.974 --> 22:24.068
- Yeah?
- I think she's a very nice girl.

22:24.176 --> 22:26.372
Seems bright,
certainly is conscientious

22:26.478 --> 22:27.877
with all the livestock.

22:27.980 --> 22:29.948
- Just your average cowgirl.
- Yeah.

22:30.049 --> 22:31.483
Her name's Thunder?

22:31.584 --> 22:33.882
I'm gonna go over there and see
if I can make some lightning.

22:33.986 --> 22:36.284
Whoa.
All right, stop your horse.

22:36.388 --> 22:37.913
Whoa, whoa, there, whoa.

22:40.693 --> 22:43.390
Ah, so you're Fonzie.

22:43.495 --> 22:44.394
Yeah.

22:44.496 --> 22:45.520
You're Thunder.

22:45.631 --> 22:48.293
Yep. And uh, this here
is Licorice.

22:48.400 --> 22:50.164
Likewise, likewise.

22:50.269 --> 22:51.998
Do you ever brush?

22:52.104 --> 22:53.765
Hey, let me say
something to you, uh...

22:53.873 --> 22:55.864
you know, in Milwaukee,
we got this, uh,

22:55.975 --> 22:58.842
natural wonder
called Inspiration Point,

22:58.944 --> 23:01.845
and I was just wondering
if maybe you and me

23:01.947 --> 23:04.609
want to start, like,
the Western version.

23:04.717 --> 23:06.515
Well thanks a lot, but uh,

23:06.619 --> 23:08.917
Richie and I have
got to walk the horses.

23:09.021 --> 23:11.012
- You do, huh?
- Uh-huh.

23:14.326 --> 23:16.624
I'm alone here.

23:16.729 --> 23:18.663
Is it me?

23:18.764 --> 23:21.495
(cow moos)

23:21.600 --> 23:24.262
Now, hold it, wait a minute.

23:28.707 --> 23:30.266
Girls, you had me worried
there for a minute.

23:30.376 --> 23:32.276
Don't do that again, huh?

23:32.378 --> 23:33.846
Nice to see you...

23:33.946 --> 23:35.107
Nice to see you.

23:35.214 --> 23:36.545
Let's go
on a little nature walk.

23:36.649 --> 23:38.174
Did you ever see this over here?

23:42.655 --> 23:44.885
-(cheering, clapping)
- POTSIE: Thank you.

23:51.063 --> 23:53.862
Thank you, thank you,
Tex Weber,

23:53.966 --> 23:56.833
for that sad but lovely song.

23:56.936 --> 23:59.871
And now it's hoedown time,
so everybody line up

23:59.972 --> 24:03.135
-(whooping)
-and it's the Virginia reel.

24:03.242 --> 24:05.438
Come on, Richie, let's stomp.

24:05.544 --> 24:07.205
Well, I don't... uh, stomp.

24:07.313 --> 24:08.803
I don't think I stomp.

24:08.914 --> 24:11.975
Hey, cowgirl, how would like
to twirl with me?

24:12.084 --> 24:14.109
I'm real sorry,
but this is Richie's dance.

24:14.219 --> 24:15.550
(band plays lively tune,
rhythmic clapping)

24:15.654 --> 24:17.383
I guess this is, uh, my dance.

24:17.489 --> 24:19.184
What do I do?

24:19.291 --> 24:21.555
I waste my gas money
looking like Roy Rogers,

24:21.660 --> 24:23.424
she dances with a carrot.

24:25.564 --> 24:27.191
Get over here.

24:27.299 --> 24:29.131
Do you want to, uh... with me?

24:29.234 --> 24:31.464
- Yeah.
- All right, let's do it.

24:31.570 --> 24:33.902
(lively music playing,
rhythmic clapping)

24:34.006 --> 24:35.997
(whooping)

24:43.983 --> 24:46.543
(whooping)

24:50.055 --> 24:52.023
(whooping)

24:58.931 --> 25:00.922
(Al whoops)

25:06.772 --> 25:08.206
(whooping)

25:08.307 --> 25:11.333
(whooping and hollering)

25:16.615 --> 25:18.606
(whooping and cheering)

25:24.023 --> 25:26.014
(hooting and whooping)

25:32.464 --> 25:34.398
(hooting and whooping)

25:34.500 --> 25:36.969
(hooting and whooping)

25:42.775 --> 25:45.642
(cheering and hooting)

25:49.882 --> 25:52.317
(cheering and hollering)

25:56.355 --> 25:59.256
(cheering)

26:06.298 --> 26:08.289
(whooping)

26:09.334 --> 26:11.325
(whooping)

26:16.809 --> 26:19.301
(song ends,
applause and cheering)

26:19.411 --> 26:22.039
(hooting)

26:25.084 --> 26:26.779
Fonz, that was pretty good.

26:26.885 --> 26:29.286
Yeah, they say that I got
a knack for the do-si-do.

26:29.388 --> 26:31.823
Do-si-do, uh...
Virginia reel.

26:31.924 --> 26:33.449
Yeah?
Well, then, I got two knacks.

26:33.559 --> 26:35.789
- You did real good, too, Richie.
- Oh, thanks.

26:35.894 --> 26:36.986
Kid didn't do too bad,

26:37.096 --> 26:38.757
once I get the hang
of it there, you know.

26:38.864 --> 26:40.889
All right, Rich, where did you
learn how to stomp like that?

26:40.999 --> 26:42.296
Oh, well, you know...

26:42.401 --> 26:44.199
I really appreciate that you
danced with me, you understand?

26:44.303 --> 26:45.702
Why don't you get yourself
some punch

26:45.804 --> 26:47.067
or something right there,
all right?

26:47.172 --> 26:49.231
- Thanks.
- Yeah, don't worry about it.

26:49.341 --> 26:51.241
Hey, Uh. pretty cowgirl,

26:51.343 --> 26:53.471
there's a beautiful moon
out there tonight.

26:53.579 --> 26:55.343
Why don't we eyeball it
together, huh?

26:55.447 --> 26:57.211
Hey, you know,
that's a good idea.

26:57.316 --> 27:00.308
I think I'll take a walk
with my two favorite fellas.

27:00.419 --> 27:01.682
Yeah.

27:01.787 --> 27:04.085
Richie and my horse, Licorice.

27:13.265 --> 27:15.256
<i>II</i>

27:26.612 --> 27:28.603
(horse neighing)

27:31.283 --> 27:33.047
(Howard blows into microphone)

27:33.152 --> 27:35.416
HOWARD (over P.A.): Good
afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.

27:35.521 --> 27:38.422
And welcome to the seventh

(applause and cheering)

27:44.129 --> 27:47.565
Sanctioned by the Colorado
County Cattleman's Association,

27:47.666 --> 27:50.067
who's also provided
all the prize money.

27:50.169 --> 27:51.933
Here's some
Western jokes, Howie.

27:52.037 --> 27:53.698
They're gold. Don't ruin 'em.

27:53.805 --> 27:55.739
Oh... Thanks, Ralph.

27:55.841 --> 27:58.572
And, uh, now, on with the rodeo!

27:58.677 --> 27:59.906
(applause and cheering)

28:00.012 --> 28:03.346
Leading off the parade

on a dancing horse.

28:05.217 --> 28:08.448
(applause, cheering

28:21.500 --> 28:23.491
(applause and cheering)

28:42.521 --> 28:44.114
HOWARD (over P.A.):
And now entering the arena

28:44.223 --> 28:46.214
is a chuck wagon.

28:48.360 --> 28:50.260
"Speaking of chuck wagons,

28:50.362 --> 28:52.456
"did you hear the one
about the drunken cowboy

28:52.564 --> 28:54.896
"who went up
to the chuck wagon chef and said

28:55.000 --> 28:57.128
"he hadn't had a bite
to eat in three days,

28:57.236 --> 28:58.397
so the chef bit him?"

28:58.503 --> 29:01.666
(crowd groaning)

29:01.773 --> 29:04.868
Oh, boy, this is exciting.

29:05.877 --> 29:07.845
Yippe-yi! Yippee-ay!

29:07.946 --> 29:09.880
Yippee-o! Yippee-u!

29:09.982 --> 29:11.416
I know all the yippees.

29:11.516 --> 29:13.678
- Let's give the fans
a thrill, Al. -Okay.

29:13.785 --> 29:15.275
- Giddyup!
- Look out, Rich!

29:15.387 --> 29:16.877
Uh, oh. Whoa! Whoa!

29:16.989 --> 29:19.686
Oh, hold the horses.
Hold the... (screams)

29:19.791 --> 29:21.156
Are you gonna make it?

29:21.260 --> 29:23.251
(Al whimpering)

29:25.864 --> 29:27.093
Oh, man!

29:27.199 --> 29:29.759
And now entering the arena
is a young lady

29:29.868 --> 29:33.065
representing one of the
most famous of Western women,

29:33.171 --> 29:34.866
Annie Oakley.

29:34.973 --> 29:36.873
(applause, cheering,
whooping & whistling)

29:36.975 --> 29:39.307
(gunshot)

29:39.411 --> 29:43.780
(whooping and cheering continue)

29:43.882 --> 29:45.372
Thank you, Annie Oakley.

29:45.484 --> 29:46.974
And button your shirt.

29:48.053 --> 29:49.350
(applause and cheering)

29:49.454 --> 29:52.617
Uh, gold helped settle the West
as thousands of prospectors

29:52.724 --> 29:54.783
flooded the area
in search of easy money

29:54.893 --> 29:57.726
and stayed
to become solid citizens.

29:57.829 --> 29:59.661
The prospector's means

29:59.765 --> 30:02.735
of transportation
was the ever-faithful burro.

30:02.834 --> 30:04.859
-(applause)
-"This burro's name is

30:04.970 --> 30:07.735
"Manhattan,
and he has four brothers--

30:07.839 --> 30:10.672
Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens
and Staten island."

30:10.776 --> 30:13.473
-(crowd groaning)
- I'm gonna kill you, Ralph.

30:13.578 --> 30:15.945
He's tarnishing my gold, Pots.

30:24.823 --> 30:27.155
(firecracker popping)

30:27.259 --> 30:29.591
Whoa! Whoa!

30:35.000 --> 30:36.968
MAN:
Oh, yeah!

30:39.671 --> 30:41.662
- MAN: Fonzie!
-(applause and cheering)

30:41.773 --> 30:44.265
(applause, cheering,
whooping and whistling)

30:48.513 --> 30:50.208
It's rodeo time,
ladies and gentlemen.

30:50.315 --> 30:51.339
(crowd cheering)

30:51.450 --> 30:53.475
And the first event
is bronco busting.

30:53.585 --> 30:56.111
In one corner, Thunder McCoy!

30:56.221 --> 30:59.350
Now, look, Thunder,
you don't have to do this.

30:59.458 --> 31:00.823
Aw, it's fun.

31:00.926 --> 31:04.692
Besides, every penny
I win goes to your Uncle Ben.

31:04.796 --> 31:05.695
See you, Richie!

31:05.797 --> 31:07.595
Outside!

31:12.137 --> 31:14.265
There goes a real human being.

31:14.373 --> 31:16.899
MAN:
Go, Thunder! Go, Thunder!

31:20.412 --> 31:22.380
Come on, Thunder!
Ride him!

31:25.050 --> 31:27.747
A beautiful ride,
ladies and gentlemen.

31:27.853 --> 31:30.220
(applause)

31:33.158 --> 31:34.319
(cheering, whooping)

31:57.115 --> 31:59.743
Aw... Fun, huh, Rich?

31:59.851 --> 32:02.081
Yup, this is the life.

32:02.187 --> 32:05.157
The great outdoors,
roping, wrangling.

32:05.257 --> 32:06.554
(laughs)

32:06.658 --> 32:08.922
Kind of makes you want
to enter it, doesn't it?

32:09.027 --> 32:10.119
Are you nuts, Rich?

32:10.228 --> 32:11.491
PHIL:
Hey, Joanie.

32:11.596 --> 32:13.462
- Hey, Rich.
- Hiya, Phil. What you doing?

32:13.565 --> 32:15.966
Well, I want to make sure
I get a good seat.

32:16.067 --> 32:17.535
The girl trick riders
are coming up.

32:17.636 --> 32:19.104
I really dig girl trick riders.

32:19.204 --> 32:20.831
Oh, what a coincidence.

32:20.939 --> 32:22.429
I'm gonna enter
the trick riding.

32:22.541 --> 32:23.770
Oh, brother.

32:23.875 --> 32:25.969
But I just taught you
how to ride yesterday.

32:26.077 --> 32:28.068
Oh, but you're such
a good teacher.

32:32.217 --> 32:33.412
Kids.

32:33.518 --> 32:35.282
(chuckles)

32:35.387 --> 32:37.378
Kids in the West.

32:41.426 --> 32:43.224
<i>Yea-haw'.!</i>

32:43.328 --> 32:45.353
Ride 'em, cowboy!

32:45.464 --> 32:47.159
I'm gonna bust this bronco.

32:47.265 --> 32:49.233
I'm gonna wear you out!

32:49.334 --> 32:51.200
<i>Yea-haw'.!</i>

32:51.303 --> 32:53.362
I think I'm ready
to try it, Pots.

32:53.472 --> 32:55.634
Yeah. Too bad they don't have
an event for this thing.

32:55.740 --> 32:56.969
You're real good.

32:57.075 --> 32:59.339
I'll tell you something, Pots...

32:59.444 --> 33:04.541
bronco riding's all a matter
of timing, skill and courage.

33:04.649 --> 33:05.582
Right.

33:05.684 --> 33:07.675
You don't have any
of those things.

33:07.786 --> 33:09.777
Pots, let's get on up
to the corral

33:09.888 --> 33:12.983
and see if we can rustle us up
some fillies.

33:13.091 --> 33:16.186
Couldn't we find us
some girls instead?

33:16.294 --> 33:18.661
Just kidding.

33:18.763 --> 33:22.859
Ladies and gentlemen, may I
direct your attention to Diablo?

33:22.968 --> 33:27.030
For the fourth consecutive year,
the Cattleman's Association

33:27.138 --> 33:28.606
is offering $1,000

33:28.707 --> 33:32.701
to the first person
who can ride this killer bull.

33:32.811 --> 33:34.108
-(applause)
- And the offer is good

33:34.212 --> 33:37.409
for the duration of Diablo's
stay at the Bar A Ranch.

33:37.516 --> 33:39.541
-(applause and cheering)
- And now, the next contestant...

33:39.651 --> 33:44.418
the next contestant is Billy
Jenkins from the Lazy Bar Ranch.

33:44.523 --> 33:47.220
-(applause)
-"Jenkins has roped many a calf.

33:47.325 --> 33:50.351
That's how he met Mrs. Jenkins."

33:50.462 --> 33:52.191
(Richie laughs loudly,
crowd groans)

33:52.297 --> 33:54.425
That's my dad.

33:54.533 --> 33:56.262
Yeah, it is.

33:56.368 --> 33:58.564
Oh, Howie,
<i>I</i> should have done the joke.

33:58.670 --> 34:00.138
Sure, Malph.

34:04.509 --> 34:06.705
Oh.

34:06.811 --> 34:07.710
It's roundup time.

34:07.812 --> 34:08.973
Not bad, huh?

34:09.080 --> 34:10.514
Whoa.

34:10.614 --> 34:12.947
Arthur, are you going
to enter any of these events?

34:13.051 --> 34:16.578
Mrs. C.,
I have set lots of records

34:16.688 --> 34:19.214
outside the rodeo arena.

34:19.324 --> 34:21.850
(giggling)

34:22.893 --> 34:24.793
Hi.

34:24.896 --> 34:26.295
Boy, it's going great, isn't it?

34:26.398 --> 34:28.661
Dad, those jokes
you're doing-- very funny.

34:28.766 --> 34:31.099
It must have been the delivery.

34:31.202 --> 34:35.469
I see your cowgirl
is doing just great out there.

34:35.574 --> 34:37.668
Fonz, she's not my cowgirl.

34:37.775 --> 34:40.609
Is that a fact?

34:40.712 --> 34:42.771
I can't believe it.
You're getting all riled up

34:42.880 --> 34:44.440
just because
we took a walk together!

34:44.549 --> 34:46.916
I'll tell you something, Carrot.
I ain't riled!

34:47.018 --> 34:50.181
(microphone feedback squealing)

34:50.288 --> 34:51.483
(feed back stops)

34:51.590 --> 34:52.819
Ladies, please.

34:52.924 --> 34:55.359
(blows on mic)
Attention, ladies and gentlemen.

34:55.460 --> 34:59.090
We have a challenger to ride
Diablo, the killer bull.

34:59.197 --> 35:01.461
- It's Hank Plunket.
-(Diablo chuffs)

35:01.566 --> 35:04.536
Hank Plunket
from H. R. Buchanan's ranch.

35:04.636 --> 35:07.503
(applause and cheering)

35:07.606 --> 35:10.041
And I have,
right here in my hand,

35:10.141 --> 35:13.771
a certified check for $1,000,

35:13.878 --> 35:16.438
if Hank can stay on
for eight seconds.

35:16.548 --> 35:18.448
(applause, cheering
and whistling)

35:18.550 --> 35:19.949
Poor Uncle Ben.

35:20.051 --> 35:23.043
That's why he tried to ride
the bull-- to win the $1,000.

35:23.154 --> 35:25.316
Well, Uncle Ben always went
for the easy buck.

35:25.423 --> 35:27.152
(Howard chuckles)

35:27.258 --> 35:28.487
Is that a joke, Howard?

35:28.593 --> 35:30.357
Watch the bull, Marion.

35:30.462 --> 35:32.726
You've got to ride
this Diablo, Hank.

35:32.831 --> 35:34.492
Those dudes, at the Bar,

35:34.599 --> 35:36.897
the Bar A Ranch,
are winning prize money.

35:37.002 --> 35:38.094
I don't like that.

35:38.203 --> 35:40.331
- All righty, boss.
- All right.

35:42.007 --> 35:43.839
I'm here
to give this gentleman a hand.

35:43.942 --> 35:45.535
Is the rope tight?

35:45.644 --> 35:46.634
Oh, don't worry, sonny.

35:46.745 --> 35:48.577
I checked it myself.

35:48.680 --> 35:51.581
I don't trust a boy
doing a man's job.

35:53.685 --> 35:55.016
You're all set, Hank.

35:55.120 --> 35:56.178
All right, here we go.

35:56.287 --> 35:57.413
- All set.
- Open the chute!

35:57.522 --> 35:59.422
- RICHIE: Good luck!
-(crowd exclaims)

35:59.524 --> 36:00.582
CROWD:
Oh!

36:00.692 --> 36:02.820
(laughs) Uh...
(clears throat)

36:02.927 --> 36:05.760
The time on that--
one second!

36:05.864 --> 36:08.356
Time sure flies when you're
having fun, doesn't it?

36:11.536 --> 36:13.698
And now for the
trick riding event.

36:13.805 --> 36:16.934
And the first contestant
will be Joanie Cunningham

36:17.042 --> 36:18.874
from the Bar A Ranch.

36:18.977 --> 36:20.206
(cheering)

36:20.311 --> 36:22.678
I-I just hope she doesn't
try anything too tricky.

36:22.781 --> 36:24.044
- Do you know what you're doing?
- Yeah!

36:24.149 --> 36:25.514
"Yeah!"
That's what you said

36:25.617 --> 36:27.642
just before you fell off that
bicycle, remember that?

36:27.752 --> 36:29.550
And this is a lot taller
than a bicycle.

36:29.654 --> 36:31.213
Aw, sit on it, Rich.

36:31.322 --> 36:32.687
You just make sure
you sit on it.

36:32.791 --> 36:34.953
LWill.

36:35.060 --> 36:36.687
(applause, cheering)

36:39.898 --> 36:41.764
I told you to sit on it!

37:08.626 --> 37:09.991
(crowd cheering)

37:15.400 --> 37:18.062
- Is she all right?
- Yes.

37:18.169 --> 37:20.797
That's our daughter, folks, huh?

37:20.905 --> 37:22.304
(whooping)

37:22.407 --> 37:25.707
Oh, Joanie, I didn't know
you could trick ride.

37:25.810 --> 37:26.743
Trick ride?!

37:26.845 --> 37:28.506
I was riding
no hands and slipped.

37:28.613 --> 37:29.910
The whole time I was trying

37:30.014 --> 37:32.073
to get back on the horse--
I tell you.

37:32.183 --> 37:35.585
Oh... (laughs)
It was nothing, nothing.

37:35.687 --> 37:36.950
All in a day's ride.

37:37.055 --> 37:38.386
Hey, Joanie, that was
really something.

37:38.490 --> 37:39.457
Yeah.

37:39.557 --> 37:41.855
Ah, well, you're
such a good teacher.

37:41.960 --> 37:44.793
Oh, yeah? Come on, I'll help you
wipe the horse down.

37:44.896 --> 37:45.988
Oh...!

37:46.097 --> 37:47.087
See you, folks.

37:49.434 --> 37:51.903
"Oh, you're
such a good teacher."

37:52.003 --> 37:54.267
- I don't know why she...
- Don't say anything, Marion.

37:54.372 --> 37:56.636
You used the same line
on me in high school.

37:56.741 --> 37:58.641
- I never did.
- Oh, yes, you did.

37:58.743 --> 38:01.235
I was getting C's in biology
and you were getting A's

38:01.346 --> 38:03.212
and you asked me to help you.

38:03.314 --> 38:05.510
You just never forget
a thing, do you, Howard?

38:05.617 --> 38:07.676
Oh, howdy, ma'am.

38:07.786 --> 38:10.312
This is a nice rodeo,
Cunningham.

38:10.421 --> 38:13.447
It's too bad
I'll be running it next year.

38:18.062 --> 38:19.655
Oh. yeah?

38:19.764 --> 38:22.256
Same to you, sidewinder.

38:22.367 --> 38:25.632
Same to you? That doesn't
make any sense, Marion.

38:25.737 --> 38:29.037
Will you just announce
the rodeo, Howard?

38:29.140 --> 38:32.974
Okay, folks, on with
our Western Jamboree.

HOWARD (over P.A.):
Ladies and gentlemen, competing

40:12.443 --> 40:15.174
in the final event of the day--
Thunder McCoy.

40:15.280 --> 40:17.180
(crowd cheering, whistling)

40:22.954 --> 40:25.514
- That, look at that! Terrific!
- Fantastic, Thunder!

40:26.624 --> 40:27.489
Boy, that was fast.
That's great.

40:27.592 --> 40:28.582
Great!

40:33.197 --> 40:36.132
Oh, a good time,
ladies and gentlemen--

40:36.234 --> 40:38.328
ten and a half seconds.

40:38.436 --> 40:39.835
Ladies and gentlemen,

40:39.938 --> 40:43.067
the official judges have picked
as the overall winner

40:43.174 --> 40:45.700
our own wrangler, Thunder McCoy.

40:45.810 --> 40:47.608
(cheering)

40:58.256 --> 41:00.486
-(Al humming cheerfully)
- Well?

41:00.591 --> 41:02.025
Ah, it's coming along
just fine.

41:02.126 --> 41:03.287
Oh, great.

41:03.394 --> 41:06.125
Maybe sometime tomorrow night.

41:07.799 --> 41:09.790
All right, then let's just
serve something else.

41:09.901 --> 41:11.460
Well, we still got the beans.

41:11.569 --> 41:14.129
Well, serve them, Alfred.

41:14.238 --> 41:16.229
You've done a wonderful job
disguising the beans.

41:16.341 --> 41:18.105
Aw, thank you.

41:18.209 --> 41:19.540
Uh, Mom... Mom, look,

41:19.644 --> 41:21.510
the guests are not
gonna like this.

41:21.612 --> 41:24.104
I mean, especially after lunch.

41:24.215 --> 41:25.774
Bean kabob.

41:25.883 --> 41:28.909
They're not gonna like
not eating, either.

41:29.020 --> 41:30.488
AL:
Hey!

41:30.588 --> 41:32.920
It just passed medium raw.

41:34.692 --> 41:35.716
Maybe I can fix it.

41:35.827 --> 41:37.818
(humming cheerfully)

41:42.367 --> 41:47.396
(guests grumbling, murmuring)

41:47.505 --> 41:48.495
Oh, hey.

41:50.375 --> 41:51.706
Ladies and gentlemen...

41:51.809 --> 41:54.506
in keeping with our
rodeo flavor of the day,

41:54.612 --> 41:56.876
our chef, Alfredo...

41:56.981 --> 41:58.813
(guests groan and boo)

42:02.186 --> 42:05.520
...has prepared
an authentic cowboy meal

42:05.623 --> 42:06.954
for you all tonight.

42:07.058 --> 42:09.891
- MAN: More beans.
-(guests grumbling)

42:09.994 --> 42:12.224
I'm sure that you're
all gonna enjoy

42:12.330 --> 42:14.458
this simple fare,

42:14.565 --> 42:17.034
so typical of the Old West.

42:17.135 --> 42:18.967
(grumbling)

42:21.506 --> 42:22.871
All right, listen up!

42:22.974 --> 42:24.169
Al's trying his best.

42:24.275 --> 42:26.437
In the old days,
you would have had to go out

42:26.544 --> 42:29.639
and trap your own dinner--
squirrels, skunks...

42:29.747 --> 42:31.715
That's right, pee-yew! Skunks!

42:31.816 --> 42:33.716
You better just be grateful.

42:33.818 --> 42:34.808
Thank you.

42:39.757 --> 42:41.748
You're all much too kind.

42:45.496 --> 42:47.965
Marion, are you sure
these figures are right?

42:48.066 --> 42:49.158
Positive.

42:49.267 --> 42:51.929
Even with the rodeo money
that Thunder won.

42:52.036 --> 42:54.266
At the rate we're going, we're
gonna be $1,200 or $1,300 short

42:54.372 --> 42:55.271
when the note comes due.

42:55.373 --> 42:56.272
(Howard sighs)

42:56.374 --> 42:57.569
Well, don't worry about it.

42:57.675 --> 42:59.404
We'll make it.

42:59.510 --> 43:03.447
Dear, this Western air
has made you so forceful.

43:03.548 --> 43:05.243
Yes, it has, hasn't it?

43:05.349 --> 43:07.545
Tell me, has it done
anything for you?

43:09.754 --> 43:11.745
Uh, maybe.

43:16.094 --> 43:18.620
Oh, uh, I'm going out
and watch the, uh,

43:18.729 --> 43:21.391
deer and the antelope play.

43:23.968 --> 43:26.266
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah...

43:37.982 --> 43:41.714
I'll see you later
at the pool, okay?

43:41.819 --> 43:43.981
Oh, I love your flower.

43:44.088 --> 43:46.182
Don't forget.

43:46.290 --> 43:49.157
Oh... the hunk loves me.

43:49.260 --> 43:50.853
The hunk loves me not.

43:50.962 --> 43:52.361
The hunk loves me.

43:52.463 --> 43:54.295
The hunk loves me not.

43:57.301 --> 43:58.632
(horn honks)

44:02.740 --> 44:04.230
Howdy.

44:14.552 --> 44:16.520
Well, hello there,
young fella.

44:16.621 --> 44:18.646
You see, I told you
that I smelled something,

44:18.756 --> 44:21.350
but I thought it was
a rotten banana, you know?

44:21.459 --> 44:22.324
It's you.

44:22.426 --> 44:23.757
What are you doing here?

44:23.861 --> 44:26.353
Oh, I just came by to remind
you all that there's just

44:26.464 --> 44:30.230
24 hours left before I,
uh, throw you off the ranch.

44:30.334 --> 44:31.859
Well, I just want to remind you

44:31.969 --> 44:33.903
that we still have a day.

44:34.005 --> 44:35.439
And we may make it.

44:35.540 --> 44:37.372
Uh-huh.

44:37.475 --> 44:40.501
Not bad for
a bunch of dudes, huh, bucko?

44:40.611 --> 44:42.010
Uh...

44:42.113 --> 44:43.342
do me a favor, okay?

44:43.447 --> 44:45.609
Don't "young man"
me again, all right?

44:45.716 --> 44:47.514
It gives me a rash.

44:47.618 --> 44:48.813
Yeah, sure.

44:59.063 --> 45:00.462
I like to leave with a bang.

45:00.565 --> 45:01.464
(popping)

45:02.800 --> 45:04.393
Hey, what's happening?

45:04.502 --> 45:07.028
- Help!
- Grab the reins, Joanie.

45:07.138 --> 45:08.765
Help!

45:08.873 --> 45:10.967
She can't! They're trailing!

45:11.075 --> 45:14.067
Help! Mom, Dad, help!

45:14.178 --> 45:15.737
Hurry! I'm afraid!

45:15.846 --> 45:17.473
I didn't know
she was in the wagon.

45:17.582 --> 45:18.879
I didn't even see her.

45:18.983 --> 45:20.610
- No kidding.
- Oh!

45:20.718 --> 45:21.776
I didn't see you either.

45:21.886 --> 45:22.785
Come on, Red, let's go.

45:22.887 --> 45:25.117
Oh, my goodness.

45:29.460 --> 45:30.723
Hold onto your hat.

45:33.664 --> 45:35.154
Oh, boys, catch her.

45:35.266 --> 45:37.701
Hurry! Please!

45:39.103 --> 45:41.868
Help! Help me!

45:41.973 --> 45:43.907
Somebody help me.

45:52.316 --> 45:54.250
I can't reach the reins!

45:57.722 --> 46:01.215
Help! Help me!

46:23.881 --> 46:26.612
Help! Help!

46:26.717 --> 46:28.742
Stop! Please, stop!

46:28.853 --> 46:31.686
Please, Fonzie,
Richie, rescue me!

46:38.496 --> 46:40.590
Help! Help!

46:45.069 --> 46:46.662
Mom, Dad, help!

46:46.771 --> 46:48.762
Hurry! I'm afraid!

46:48.873 --> 46:51.604
Stop! Please stop!

47:04.422 --> 47:06.652
Please, Fonzie, Richie,
rescue me!

47:08.125 --> 47:11.151
Help! Help me!

47:37.888 --> 47:39.549
We're gaining on 'em!

47:39.657 --> 47:41.955
Good, Fonz! Just keep me posted!

47:42.059 --> 47:44.050
Fonzie, Richie, help me!

47:44.161 --> 47:46.220
I can't get the reins!

47:46.330 --> 47:48.697
Help me!

47:49.967 --> 47:52.527
Fonzie, Richie, get up here!

47:52.636 --> 47:56.334
I can't...
Help me, Richie!

47:57.708 --> 47:59.699
Watch out,
watch out for the wheel!

47:59.810 --> 48:01.744
Hold on, Cunningham!

48:01.846 --> 48:02.938
Why?

48:03.047 --> 48:04.947
You don't want to know.

48:05.049 --> 48:07.108
Fonzie, watch out for the ditch!

48:15.025 --> 48:18.017
FONZIE:
