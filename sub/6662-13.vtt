00:04.838 --> 00:07.924
My name is Bridget.
I witnessed a murder.

00:07.966 --> 00:10.760
Just get up on the stand
and tell the judge
what you saw.

00:10.802 --> 00:12.470
-And we'll protect you.
-You don't get it.

00:12.512 --> 00:15.724
Bodaway wants me dead,
I'm dead.

00:15.765 --> 00:18.435
BRIDGET: I ran to my sister,
Siobhan, for help.

00:18.476 --> 00:20.895
Siobhan killed herself,
and I assumed her identity.

00:20.937 --> 00:22.230
It was so easy.

00:22.272 --> 00:23.606
I saw a way out, and I took it.

00:23.648 --> 00:25.817
They all think that I'm her.

00:25.859 --> 00:27.652
CATHERINE: What is your
problem, Siobhan?

00:27.694 --> 00:29.988
After all,
this was my tub first.

00:30.030 --> 00:31.239
Hi, Mommy.

00:31.281 --> 00:32.866
You had sex with Mr. Carpenter?

00:32.907 --> 00:35.160
He forced himself on me.

00:35.201 --> 00:37.078
TESSA: I heard you weren't gonna
press charges against Mr. C.

00:37.120 --> 00:39.414
He forced me
to have sex with him, too.

00:39.456 --> 00:40.623
-Solomon?
-Who's this?

00:40.665 --> 00:41.958
Cora Farrell.

00:42.000 --> 00:43.168
Hello, Miss Farrell.
It's been a while.

00:43.209 --> 00:44.377
I'll pick you up in an hour.

00:44.419 --> 00:45.795
We have been here
for half an hour,

00:45.837 --> 00:47.797
and you haven't said
a word to me, Siobhan.

00:47.839 --> 00:50.091
Then look behind me.

00:50.133 --> 00:53.470
That's Bridget.

00:53.511 --> 00:56.014
She's the one living the lie
with Andrew, not me.

01:07.942 --> 01:09.360
Hello, Ms. Farrell.

01:09.402 --> 01:11.446
Two times
in one week?

01:11.488 --> 01:13.114
You know, just call me
Cora.

01:22.791 --> 01:24.501
You in the military?

01:24.542 --> 01:26.836
Was. Special Forces.

01:26.878 --> 01:29.422
Wow.

01:29.464 --> 01:32.550
Um, how-how did I first
contact you?

01:32.592 --> 01:34.469
You called
a car service.

01:34.511 --> 01:36.346
Said you wanted
somebody discreet.

01:36.387 --> 01:38.640
And I always paid in cash?

01:40.683 --> 01:42.852
Why are you asking me
about what you did?

01:44.104 --> 01:47.482
I'm newly sober.

01:47.524 --> 01:51.236
I have whole chunks of time
that I-I can't remember.

01:51.277 --> 01:52.737
Well, now
that I'm-I'm clean,

01:52.779 --> 01:54.739
I'm-I'm trying
to figure out who I was,

01:54.781 --> 01:58.827
'cause it's kind of
affecting who I am now.

01:58.868 --> 02:00.036
Does...

02:00.078 --> 02:02.705
that make sense?

02:02.747 --> 02:05.458
I need answers.

02:05.500 --> 02:07.460
I'll pay you double
to help me get them.

02:07.502 --> 02:09.629
No questions asked.

02:09.671 --> 02:11.089
How can I help?

02:11.131 --> 02:12.298
When was the last time

02:12.340 --> 02:13.758
that you drove me?

02:18.429 --> 02:20.807
September 8th.

02:20.849 --> 02:22.892
September 8th?

02:23.977 --> 02:26.813
I missed you so much.

02:29.023 --> 02:30.733
Siobhan?!

02:30.775 --> 02:32.277
Oh, my God.

02:34.696 --> 02:36.698
Something happen?

02:36.739 --> 02:38.491
Uh, yeah.

02:38.533 --> 02:42.579
Something awful
to somebody I really loved.

02:42.620 --> 02:45.707
And I-I don't know why.

02:45.748 --> 02:49.669
Maybe if I retraced my steps
from that day...

02:49.711 --> 02:51.838
All right.

02:51.880 --> 02:54.090
First stop, Harlem.

02:56.885 --> 03:00.096
[passing car horn honking,
indistinct chatter]

03:02.891 --> 03:04.642
MAN: Mind your
business!

03:10.982 --> 03:13.735
SECURITY GUARD:
We never listed your name
or your office, Ms. Farrell.

03:13.776 --> 03:14.986
Just like you asked.

03:15.028 --> 03:17.155
My office?

03:17.197 --> 03:19.657
I'm surprised to
see you.

03:19.699 --> 03:21.576
You usually come
through the back.

03:21.618 --> 03:24.996
You know, I can't seem
to find my keys anywhere.

03:25.038 --> 03:27.540
Do you think
you could let me in?

05:34.417 --> 05:36.336
[passing car horn honking]

05:36.377 --> 05:40.548
Okay, do you by any
chance recognize this?

05:40.590 --> 05:43.134
-Should I?
-Uh, I don't know.

05:43.176 --> 05:45.553
What about this address?

05:45.595 --> 05:47.013
Have you ever
driven me there?

05:47.055 --> 05:49.098
Not that I can remember.

05:49.140 --> 05:50.683
What's the Zip code?

05:50.725 --> 05:52.018
I can reroute us
if you'd like.

05:52.060 --> 05:53.811
I don't know it.

05:53.853 --> 05:56.481
Well, you know,
there's probably about
1,000 Main Streets

05:56.522 --> 05:57.857
in the tri-state area?

05:57.899 --> 06:00.193
[inhales deeply]

06:00.234 --> 06:02.862
Just take me
to the next stop, please.

06:02.904 --> 06:04.697
You gonna sit
in the front?

06:04.739 --> 06:07.116
Yeah. Is that cool?

06:07.158 --> 06:09.410
You sure are
different sober.

06:09.452 --> 06:11.120
[engine starting]

06:12.955 --> 06:15.291
[horns honking]

06:15.333 --> 06:17.418
HENRY:
Oh, come on, Siobhan.

06:17.460 --> 06:21.089
I cannot believe that
you let Bridget be you.

06:21.130 --> 06:22.715
Her life was in danger.

06:22.757 --> 06:24.926
She came to me. I couldn't
turn away my sister.

06:24.967 --> 06:26.803
Okay, and so, swapping
lives is your answer?

06:26.844 --> 06:28.554
And why didn't you
tell me?

06:28.596 --> 06:30.056
I would have helped you.

06:30.098 --> 06:31.474
Because she convinced me

06:31.516 --> 06:33.267
it was too dangerous
to get anyone involved.

06:33.309 --> 06:34.811
[groans]

06:36.729 --> 06:39.899
Look, I had just
found out

06:39.941 --> 06:42.944
that I was pregnant
with our baby.

06:42.985 --> 06:45.530
I needed some time
to think.

06:45.571 --> 06:47.407
Bridget convinced me
this was the best plan.

06:47.448 --> 06:49.450
She could hide out by being me,
and I could get some distance,

06:49.492 --> 06:51.536
come up with a plan.

06:51.577 --> 06:53.955
Okay, this...this
is insane, Siobhan,

06:53.996 --> 06:55.998
and had you just
warned me,

06:56.040 --> 06:57.542
I would have stayed
away from Bridget.

06:57.583 --> 06:59.293
I didn't think
it was gonna be necessary,

06:59.335 --> 07:01.879
because I told her
to stay away from you.

07:01.921 --> 07:03.923
Besides, it was just
supposed to be temporary.

07:03.965 --> 07:06.634
-I never...
-So, you didn't think.

07:06.676 --> 07:08.052
You didn't think,

07:08.094 --> 07:10.179
and do you understand,
by not letting me in,

07:10.221 --> 07:13.891
how badly my life
has fallen apart?

07:13.933 --> 07:15.935
I'm so sorry.

07:15.977 --> 07:19.605
Henry, the last thing
I wanted was to hurt you.

07:19.647 --> 07:22.233
Or Gemma.
Things went haywire

07:22.275 --> 07:24.569
when Bridget met that
low-life Charlie at N.A.

07:24.610 --> 07:26.195
They got so greedy.

07:26.237 --> 07:29.031
They saw an opportunity
in kidnapping Gemma.

07:29.073 --> 07:30.658
I came back
the second I heard.

07:30.700 --> 07:32.243
All right,
we end this now.

07:32.285 --> 07:34.120
Let's expose Bridget,
and get your life back.

07:34.162 --> 07:35.872
I don't want my life back.

07:37.582 --> 07:40.251
-Not yet.
-Why?

07:40.293 --> 07:42.962
Because I found
something out in Paris,

07:43.004 --> 07:45.298
something that
involves Andrew.

07:45.339 --> 07:47.633
Henry, we have
an ironclad prenup.

07:47.675 --> 07:50.011
If we get divorced,
I don't get a penny.

07:50.052 --> 07:52.722
But I think I may have found
a way for us to be together

07:52.763 --> 07:55.183
with Andrew's money.

07:55.224 --> 07:57.351
I need to show you.

07:57.393 --> 08:00.021
But Bridget stole a key from
this office that I need.

08:00.062 --> 08:01.689
Okay, I can help
you get it back.

08:01.731 --> 08:03.232
You can't.

08:03.274 --> 08:04.984
Henry, we have
to keep our distance,

08:05.026 --> 08:06.527
or this will all fall apart.

08:06.569 --> 08:08.488
[sighs]

08:08.529 --> 08:10.323
Trust me.

08:10.364 --> 08:14.327
When I get that key back,
it will all make sense.

08:16.370 --> 08:19.457
DELUCA:
As your attorney, it's my job

08:19.499 --> 08:20.833
to make sure you don't
freeze up on the stand.

08:20.875 --> 08:23.002
-Okay.
-Okay? I'm gonna ask you again.

08:23.044 --> 08:25.963
What happened
on the night in question?

08:27.548 --> 08:29.926
I was in, um,
Mr. Carpenter's class

08:29.967 --> 08:32.345
right after the Young Samaritans
pizza party.

08:32.386 --> 08:33.679
He got mad at me.

08:33.721 --> 08:35.431
Said I was acting
inappropriately.

08:35.473 --> 08:37.808
I told him he was
reading into things,

08:37.850 --> 08:40.019
but he still asked me
to stay after class.

08:40.061 --> 08:42.480
The second we were alone,
he started acting...

08:42.522 --> 08:43.689
weird.

08:43.731 --> 08:44.941
Weird how?

08:44.982 --> 08:46.275
That's too vague.

08:46.317 --> 08:48.319
Be as specific
as you possibly can, Juliet.

08:50.446 --> 08:53.282
-What are you doing tonight?
-Juliet!

08:53.324 --> 08:55.076
Andrea, please
wait in the hall.

08:55.117 --> 08:57.203
I'd like to finish
my conversation with Ms. Martin.

08:57.245 --> 09:00.248
JULIET:
He got nice.

09:00.289 --> 09:03.334
And then he came over to me,

09:03.376 --> 09:05.586
and he tucked his...

09:05.628 --> 09:08.464
He tucked my hair
behind my ear.

09:09.674 --> 09:11.634
And he whispered,

09:11.676 --> 09:14.804
"I bet you're the kind of girl
who can keep secrets."

09:17.223 --> 09:19.100
I told him I wanted to leave.

09:19.141 --> 09:21.978
And then he grabbed
my left arm...

09:22.019 --> 09:23.854
[voice breaking]
pushed me against the wall,

09:23.896 --> 09:25.231
pulled my skirt up, and...

09:25.273 --> 09:26.941
CATHERINE:
You originally said

09:26.983 --> 09:29.026
your right arm.

09:29.068 --> 09:31.654
JULIET: Did I?

09:31.696 --> 09:34.240
Look, this is exactly
what I am talking about.

09:34.282 --> 09:35.575
If she can't keep
her story straight,

09:35.616 --> 09:37.201
she's gonna look
like a liar.

09:37.243 --> 09:39.036
Calm down, will you?
Juliet's just nervous.

09:39.078 --> 09:40.329
Cut her some slack.

09:40.371 --> 09:41.706
I'm afraid
Catherine's right.

09:41.747 --> 09:43.249
Juliet, your testimony
has to be a carbon copy

09:43.291 --> 09:44.709
of what you told
the police.

09:44.750 --> 09:46.502
Otherwise, you're on
the stand, the defense--

09:46.544 --> 09:48.546
they'll pull you apart
during the cross exam.

09:48.588 --> 09:49.922
Okay.

09:49.964 --> 09:51.632
So, was it your right arm?

09:51.674 --> 09:53.759
Yeah. I just
made a mistake.

09:53.801 --> 09:55.511
Let me start again.

09:55.553 --> 09:58.222
Look, could you
give us a moment, please?

09:58.264 --> 10:00.099
Absolutely.

10:03.644 --> 10:04.937
Both of you?

10:10.860 --> 10:12.528
Are you okay?

10:12.570 --> 10:14.155
Dad, I thought this was
a good idea at first,

10:14.196 --> 10:16.324
but I'm not so sure
I can do this.

10:16.365 --> 10:18.659
What did I tell you?!
This is a mistake!

10:18.701 --> 10:20.036
Catherine,
in two seconds,

10:20.077 --> 10:21.662
you're on a plane
to Miami, okay?

10:21.704 --> 10:23.623
Fine. You're flying me
first class.

10:23.664 --> 10:26.375
Just please
stop fighting!

10:29.211 --> 10:32.757
I will get it right,
I promise.

10:37.553 --> 10:38.971
[doorbell rings]

10:42.099 --> 10:43.643
A gift for the boys.

10:43.684 --> 10:45.645
Egyptian cotton.

10:45.686 --> 10:47.480
Thanks.

10:47.521 --> 10:50.650
This is so unnecessary,
really.

10:50.691 --> 10:53.444
You gonna invite me in?

10:53.486 --> 10:55.738
[chuckles] Do I need to?
Are you a vampire?

10:55.780 --> 10:57.406
Been called worse.

11:00.493 --> 11:02.662
So, every week,
there is a new document

11:02.703 --> 11:04.538
for me to sign
from Martin/Charles.

11:04.580 --> 11:05.790
What's it now?

11:05.831 --> 11:07.667
No more papers, I promise.

11:07.708 --> 11:09.585
Well, I know you didn't

11:09.627 --> 11:11.712
trek down to Gramercy Park
to deliver baby pajamas.

11:11.754 --> 11:14.215
What's up?

11:14.256 --> 11:16.759
I need you to introduce me
to your father-in-law.

11:16.801 --> 11:19.553
Why?

11:19.595 --> 11:22.348
I want to get him to
invest in Martin/Charles.

11:22.390 --> 11:25.184
The man had a coronary after
the death of his daughter.

11:25.226 --> 11:27.269
He's hardly open
to change right now.

11:27.311 --> 11:29.438
But that's all
the more reason for him

11:29.480 --> 11:31.357
to protect his assets,

11:31.399 --> 11:33.609
secure his legacy.

11:33.651 --> 11:35.444
You'd be doing him
a favor.

11:35.486 --> 11:38.155
Tim Arbogast is a
millionaire many times over.

11:38.197 --> 11:40.449
I think he'll be okay.

11:40.491 --> 11:42.243
A simple reference.

11:42.284 --> 11:44.870
That's all I'm asking.

11:44.912 --> 11:48.541
I'll take care
of the rest.

11:48.582 --> 11:50.459
I'm not doing it, Olivia.

11:50.501 --> 11:52.086
If you want to get
to a man like Arbogast,

11:52.128 --> 11:54.088
you have to be
a little more creative

11:54.130 --> 11:55.840
and a little less
transparent.

12:02.638 --> 12:04.181
I, um...

12:04.223 --> 12:06.767
I was really hoping it
wouldn't come to this.

12:06.809 --> 12:09.645
You and Siobhan look
quite cozy here.

12:12.606 --> 12:14.275
Where did you get that?

12:14.316 --> 12:16.902
Guess I was just
being creative.

12:16.944 --> 12:18.237
How many copies are there?

12:18.279 --> 12:19.822
This is the only one.

12:19.864 --> 12:22.074
Right now.

12:22.116 --> 12:24.660
You get me Arbogast...

12:24.702 --> 12:26.287
I hit delete.

12:43.053 --> 12:44.513
Doesn't look like
my kind of place.

12:44.555 --> 12:45.931
Maybe not the new you,

12:45.973 --> 12:47.933
but the old you
loved this place.

12:47.975 --> 12:49.894
Used to sit at
the chess table for hours.

13:21.759 --> 13:23.719
You gonna make a wish?

13:23.761 --> 13:25.638
A wish?

13:25.679 --> 13:27.890
It's our hokey
tradition. Here.

13:27.932 --> 13:29.975
Write down what
you want most

13:30.017 --> 13:32.353
and stick it in the slot
with your name and the date.

13:32.394 --> 13:33.562
Who knows?

13:33.604 --> 13:35.648

My sister lied to me.

14:36.876 --> 14:39.211
I wonder what else
she lied to me about.

14:48.304 --> 14:50.306
And how are you feeling
these days?

14:50.347 --> 14:52.099
I'm still smoking.

14:52.141 --> 14:54.643
I know it's
ridiculous, but...

14:54.685 --> 14:57.271
just haven't been able
to quit, even after
the heart attack.

14:57.313 --> 15:01.233
Well, Gemma's death
has been...

15:01.275 --> 15:03.360
hard on everyone.

15:07.031 --> 15:09.658
We haven't been
one-on-one

15:09.700 --> 15:14.663
since the day you asked
to marry my daughter.

15:14.705 --> 15:16.832
I should...I should've
reached out sooner.

15:19.126 --> 15:22.212
You said you had some
business to discuss?

15:24.798 --> 15:28.344
I may be stubborn,
but I'm not blind.

15:29.470 --> 15:31.263
I know what I'm
doing here.

15:31.305 --> 15:33.057
You do?

15:33.098 --> 15:36.685
You wanted to stay
connected to Gemma.

15:36.727 --> 15:37.895
And you can.

15:37.937 --> 15:40.272
I'll always love her.

15:40.314 --> 15:43.943
And I feel the same
about you, Henry.

15:43.984 --> 15:46.278
Well, then it's important
to take care

15:46.320 --> 15:50.282
of your... legacy, Tim.

15:50.324 --> 15:53.494
especially when your
health is in question.

15:56.622 --> 16:00.501
Did Gemma ever mention the
firm Martin/Charles to you?

16:03.003 --> 16:05.673
Cavalli's too loud,
Versace too trashy,

16:05.714 --> 16:07.299
Marc Jacobs too flirty.

16:07.341 --> 16:09.593
Why don't I just
wear a nun's habit?

16:09.635 --> 16:11.720
Could you take this
seriously, please?

16:11.762 --> 16:12.930
Maybe you should wear Chanel.

16:12.972 --> 16:14.139
[sighs]

16:14.181 --> 16:15.349
It's classic,
it's elegant.

16:15.391 --> 16:16.850
It's almost heroic.

16:16.892 --> 16:19.311
And virgins wear Chanel,
don't they?

16:19.353 --> 16:21.397
Whatever you want.

16:21.438 --> 16:22.940
Sit up.

16:24.817 --> 16:26.735
Hug your mother.

16:28.737 --> 16:30.948
Mm, I think I have some
pearls at the hotel.

16:43.127 --> 16:46.714
I have pearls
if you need.

16:46.755 --> 16:48.757
Great.

16:48.799 --> 16:50.926
So are you going
to lecture me about
what to wear, too?

16:50.968 --> 16:53.345
I was just trying to help.

16:55.889 --> 16:58.350
Wait, Siobhan.
I-I'm sorry.

17:00.853 --> 17:03.230
My mom's just a lot

17:03.272 --> 17:04.732
to deal with.

17:04.773 --> 17:06.358
That's a word for it.

17:06.400 --> 17:10.362
She keeps making me feel
like a disaster.

17:10.404 --> 17:12.573
Okay? Like I'm going
to get on the stand,

17:12.614 --> 17:15.325
and I'm going to mess
it all up.

17:15.367 --> 17:17.369
You won't.

17:17.411 --> 17:20.372
Yeah, but I just wish she'd
stop being such a bitch.

17:22.833 --> 17:26.670
For once, it would be nice
to have a normal mom.

17:28.756 --> 17:30.591
Someone who doesn't make me

17:30.632 --> 17:32.426
feel like I'm making
a mistake by doing this.

17:32.468 --> 17:35.596
You're not.

17:35.637 --> 17:37.765
It takes a lot of courage
to stand up to someone

17:37.806 --> 17:39.600
and not run away.

17:39.641 --> 17:42.186
Believe me, I know.

But you don't have to
be afraid.

Come on. You know
your testimony.

17:47.024 --> 17:49.234
Your family's gonna be
there to support you.

17:49.276 --> 17:51.111
Before you know it,
it's gonna be over.

17:51.153 --> 17:52.488
Then you can start fresh.

17:52.529 --> 17:54.031
I promise.

17:55.449 --> 17:57.409
I really need you
there tomorrow.

18:00.245 --> 18:02.623
Then I'll be there.

18:14.968 --> 18:17.012
How can you afford
this place?

18:17.054 --> 18:20.474
Mm, I said
I was on a budget.

18:20.516 --> 18:22.309
I'm not destitute.

18:25.687 --> 18:28.273
I'm gonna go take
a shower.

Sorry. Is, uh,
Siobhan there?

She's not available
right now.

Can I, um, can I tell her
who called?

19:04.393 --> 19:06.979
Tyler Barrett.

19:07.020 --> 19:09.523
Do you want me to tell her
what this is regarding?

19:09.565 --> 19:11.441
She'll know.

19:11.483 --> 19:14.153

19:23.871 --> 19:26.081
who's Tyler Barrett?

19:27.249 --> 19:28.917
Why?

19:28.959 --> 19:30.919
He just called.

19:30.961 --> 19:33.797
Why would you answer
that call?

19:33.839 --> 19:35.382
Because it kept ringing.

19:35.424 --> 19:37.593
He's a good-looking guy,
wouldn't you say?

19:39.553 --> 19:44.933
[sighs] Tyler Barrett is the
head of European operations

19:44.975 --> 19:48.020
for Martin/Charles.

19:48.061 --> 19:50.105
He's been helping me
while I've been in Paris.

19:50.147 --> 19:52.733
Helping how?

19:52.774 --> 19:54.735
He has access
to classified information.

19:54.776 --> 19:56.528
What kind
of information?

19:56.570 --> 20:00.240
The kind of information
that incriminates Andrew

20:00.282 --> 20:01.950
and lets us be together

20:01.992 --> 20:03.952
and never have to
worry about money.

20:06.580 --> 20:09.124
You don't believe me?

20:10.209 --> 20:11.960
I do.

20:12.002 --> 20:15.339
I do. It's just...

20:15.380 --> 20:18.550
It's been hard to
get over everything.

20:20.510 --> 20:21.970
I understand.

20:23.513 --> 20:26.558
But I never once strayed
from my plan to be with you.

20:28.185 --> 20:29.978
I love you.

20:30.020 --> 20:32.064
I love you, too.

20:34.191 --> 20:37.027
I just want all of
this to be behind us.

I was just trying
to make her feel better.

21:31.248 --> 21:33.000
It's not a competition.

21:33.041 --> 21:34.918
Feels like it.

21:36.461 --> 21:38.630
What's your angle?

21:38.672 --> 21:40.549
I don't have one.

21:42.259 --> 21:44.428
You're too hard
on her, Catherine.

21:44.469 --> 21:47.514
She just wants you
to be nice to her.

21:47.556 --> 21:51.435
I was just trying
to protect her.

21:51.476 --> 21:54.062
Maybe you guys could do
something special.

21:54.104 --> 21:55.856
You know,
just the two of you.

21:55.897 --> 21:57.441
We went ice skating
over the holidays.

21:57.482 --> 21:59.234
She loved it.

21:59.276 --> 22:01.737
Yeah, we used to do that
when she was little.

22:01.778 --> 22:03.822
Tell you what,

22:03.864 --> 22:07.242
I will leave and give
you guys some space.

22:09.745 --> 22:11.246
Yeah?

22:11.288 --> 22:13.665
Thanks for not
being a bitch.

22:19.379 --> 22:21.465
How was it?

22:23.216 --> 22:25.802
Not too bad, yeah.

22:25.844 --> 22:27.471
Don't worry.

22:27.512 --> 22:28.680
It's kind of
like a shot.

22:28.722 --> 22:31.308
Over before
you know it.

22:31.350 --> 22:33.894
All you gotta do is
tell them the truth
about what Mr. C did.

what's going on?

22:42.069 --> 22:44.071
I can't do this.

22:44.112 --> 22:45.864
Sure you can.

22:45.906 --> 22:49.910
You showed up, wearing a...
pantsuit and everything.

22:49.951 --> 22:52.287
You just point
to the douche bag

22:52.329 --> 22:53.789
when they ask you
who did it.

22:53.830 --> 22:54.998
I can't.

22:55.040 --> 22:56.500
Why not?

22:57.584 --> 22:59.294
I lied.

22:59.336 --> 23:02.255
Mr. C never actually
assaulted me.

23:02.297 --> 23:04.508
Oh, my God.
Are you kidding me?!

23:04.549 --> 23:06.551
Why the hell would you
do something like that?!

23:06.593 --> 23:08.720
'Cause the day when we
first met, when we got

23:08.762 --> 23:10.722
in that fight
in the hallway,

23:10.764 --> 23:12.516
Mr. C took your side.

23:12.557 --> 23:14.351
No, he blamed me

23:14.393 --> 23:15.685
for it, and he didn't
even see who started it.

23:15.727 --> 23:18.897
So you accused him
of sexual assault?!

23:18.939 --> 23:20.732
I got suspended
that day.

23:20.774 --> 23:23.985
I was already flunking out,
and...when I got back,

23:24.027 --> 23:25.946
I had so much
damn detention,

23:25.987 --> 23:28.073
I could barely
catch up, okay?

23:28.115 --> 23:30.325
You know what?
Mr. C...

23:30.367 --> 23:34.162
was actually nice to me
before you showed up.

23:34.204 --> 23:37.124
And then he changed.

23:37.165 --> 23:39.251
And I just wanted
to hurt him.

23:40.961 --> 23:42.963
I gotta go.

23:43.004 --> 23:45.632
Tessa! Tessa! Wait!

23:58.812 --> 24:00.439
When Tessa Banners admitted,

24:00.480 --> 24:03.191
said she was gonna
lie on the stand,

24:03.233 --> 24:05.610
we had no choice
but to drop the case.

24:05.652 --> 24:07.779
What if we didn't?

24:07.821 --> 24:09.865
It'd be right back
to a "he-said, she-said."

24:09.906 --> 24:11.575
I hate to be blunt,

24:11.616 --> 24:13.785
but Carpenter, he's got
a sterling reputation.

24:13.827 --> 24:17.706
And Juliet, not so much.

24:17.747 --> 24:20.041
And I'm afraid
I have some more bad news.

24:22.461 --> 24:24.337
Carpenter's suing you

24:24.379 --> 24:27.340
for defamation
of character.

24:27.382 --> 24:28.842
This is a joke?

24:28.884 --> 24:30.552
He's alleging
you've ruined his career

24:30.594 --> 24:32.304
and will never get a job
teaching again.

24:32.345 --> 24:34.097
Good!

24:34.139 --> 24:35.724
And that man's
an animal.

24:35.765 --> 24:37.392
I don't want him
50 yards near a school.

24:37.434 --> 24:39.019
I'm not paying
him a cent.

24:39.060 --> 24:41.104
This is exactly
what I said would happen.

24:41.146 --> 24:43.023
If the case goes south,
which it has,

24:43.064 --> 24:44.816
Juliet will be vilified.

24:44.858 --> 24:46.109
Well, we'll counter
the suit.

24:46.151 --> 24:47.819
We can counter anything.

24:47.861 --> 24:49.404
It's just a matter
of how quickly

24:49.446 --> 24:51.031
you want this
to go away.

24:52.449 --> 24:54.117
The last thing
that our daughter

24:54.159 --> 24:56.286
needs right now
is another trial.

24:56.328 --> 24:58.079
You saw how upset
she was today.

24:58.121 --> 24:59.456
What? We tell her that

24:59.498 --> 25:00.832
she has to go through
all of this again?

25:00.874 --> 25:03.460
She's gonna spend
years in therapy.

25:03.502 --> 25:05.253
Maybe we should settle.

25:05.295 --> 25:06.838
You know,
just get this creep

25:06.880 --> 25:08.423
out of our lives for good.

25:08.465 --> 25:11.051
But it's millions
of dollars!

25:11.092 --> 25:13.637
And if we drag this out
with another lawsuit,

25:13.678 --> 25:16.056
she will never get
a chance to start over.

25:16.097 --> 25:18.391
Okay. She needs
new friends, a new school.

25:18.433 --> 25:21.853
A chance to rebuild
her reputation.

25:21.895 --> 25:24.940
Look, I know it is an
astronomical amount of money,

25:24.981 --> 25:27.692
but, I mean, it's just
the starting price, right?

25:27.734 --> 25:29.653
Mm-hmm.

25:29.694 --> 25:33.949
[sighs] We have screwed up
Juliet's life enough.

25:33.990 --> 25:36.117
Let's not screw
this up, too.

25:38.620 --> 25:41.581
[train whistle blowing]

25:41.623 --> 25:44.209
Surprised you called.

25:44.251 --> 25:46.836
You were pretty
shook up yesterday.

25:46.878 --> 25:48.338
Yeah.

25:51.716 --> 25:56.763
September 8th was
the day before my sister...

25:56.805 --> 25:58.682
killed herself.

26:00.725 --> 26:02.352
Sorry to hear that.

26:02.394 --> 26:04.771
I thought maybe--
I don't know--

26:04.813 --> 26:07.857
retracing the steps might
give me some insight

26:07.899 --> 26:10.026
into why she did it.

26:10.068 --> 26:14.656
My sister
and I'd had a falling out.

26:14.698 --> 26:18.910
But I thought she'd
forgiven me before she died.

26:18.952 --> 26:20.912
Turns out that I was wrong.

26:20.954 --> 26:24.708
That's why I called you.

26:24.749 --> 26:27.419
I need to finish
what I started.

26:43.268 --> 26:45.437
SOLOMON: Last time
I drove you here,

26:45.478 --> 26:47.355
you disappeared
behind that door.

26:52.736 --> 26:54.613
[guns firing nearby]

26:57.198 --> 26:59.367
[muffled gunshots]

27:04.080 --> 27:06.082
Interested in shooting today?

27:06.124 --> 27:08.918
Do you recognize me?

27:08.960 --> 27:10.545
Of course.

27:10.587 --> 27:12.380
Though you haven't been
here in a while.

27:12.422 --> 27:14.758
Figured someone
wasn't letting you
play with guns anymore.

27:14.799 --> 27:17.177
You were
a pretty good shot...

27:17.218 --> 27:19.304
for a girl.

27:19.346 --> 27:21.765
I think I left something
in one of the lockers.

27:21.806 --> 27:23.224
Be my guest.

27:35.904 --> 27:37.280
Where have you been?

27:37.322 --> 27:38.740
I've been calling you
all day.

27:38.782 --> 27:40.533
What do you want?

27:40.575 --> 27:42.702
To explain what happened
yesterday.

27:42.744 --> 27:45.038
Don't bother, Siobhan.
I'm done.

27:45.080 --> 27:46.998
Why, because you had
a conversation

27:47.040 --> 27:49.209
with my brother?

27:49.250 --> 27:50.835
Your brother?

27:50.877 --> 27:53.213
Am I not allowed
to have a brother?

27:53.254 --> 27:55.757
Yeah, of course you are.

27:55.799 --> 27:57.842
I just thought that...

27:57.884 --> 27:59.678
And I thought that we
were past all of this.

27:59.719 --> 28:02.430
Tyler, you have to start
to trust me.

28:02.472 --> 28:04.641
I'm sorry,
all right?

28:04.683 --> 28:06.810
It's just having
you so far away...

28:08.853 --> 28:10.980
Look, the reason I called
yesterday is because

28:11.022 --> 28:13.692
an I.T. guy in
the office has started
asking questions,

28:13.733 --> 28:15.485
the wrong kind.

28:15.527 --> 28:17.070
He wants to know why I'm
accessing confidential

28:17.112 --> 28:18.988
Martin/Charles
documents.

28:19.030 --> 28:20.657
What did you tell him?

28:20.699 --> 28:23.034
Nothing. But if he noticed,
other people will, too.

28:24.869 --> 28:27.455
I don't know how
much longer I can
do this, Siobhan.

28:27.497 --> 28:29.916
Please, Tyler,
you can't back out now.

28:29.958 --> 28:32.460
If not for me, then for...

28:37.674 --> 28:39.801
[gun firing in distance]

28:57.527 --> 29:00.488
Do you recognize this guy?

29:00.530 --> 29:02.949
Was I coming here
to protect myself from him?

29:02.991 --> 29:06.411
You weren't
scared of this guy.
You were meeting him.

29:06.453 --> 29:09.873
-What?
-His name was John, right?

29:09.914 --> 29:11.499
He's your friend.

29:11.541 --> 29:14.586
Are you sure
you're not mistaken?

29:14.627 --> 29:16.254
I didn't
introduce myself.

29:16.296 --> 29:18.923
The name's Charlie.
Been sober four years.

29:18.965 --> 29:20.842
Will you excuse me
for one second?

29:20.884 --> 29:22.051
Yeah.

29:26.931 --> 29:28.683
Malcolm, it's me.

29:28.725 --> 29:31.519
Siobhan and John Delario
were friends,

29:31.561 --> 29:35.148
but when we met,
he introduced himself to me.

29:35.190 --> 29:36.941
He had to have known
that I wasn't her.

29:36.983 --> 29:38.693
It doesn't make any sense.

29:40.528 --> 29:42.405
Oh, my God.

29:42.447 --> 29:45.533
If-if John wasn't the killer,

29:45.575 --> 29:48.661
then does that mean that
there's someone still after me?

29:59.964 --> 30:02.926
So what are
you gonna do?

30:02.967 --> 30:05.804
Catherine thinks
I should settle,

30:05.845 --> 30:07.347
and that's crazy, right?

30:08.973 --> 30:11.392
I don't know.

30:11.434 --> 30:13.144
Carpenter's a monster.

30:13.186 --> 30:15.146
I'm not gonna reward him
for what he did.

30:15.188 --> 30:16.815
I know. It's just...

30:16.856 --> 30:19.943
I don't know if
Juliet could stand
another trial.

30:19.984 --> 30:22.487
She thought it was
all over after today.

30:24.614 --> 30:26.449
That's what Catherine said.

30:29.994 --> 30:32.747
Believe me, I hate
saying this, but...

30:32.789 --> 30:34.958
Catherine's right.

30:34.999 --> 30:37.460
You should settle.

30:37.502 --> 30:40.171
Let Juliet get
the fresh start
that she needs.

30:40.213 --> 30:41.756
[elevator bell dings]

30:44.801 --> 30:46.761
ANDREW:
Well, there's a treat.

30:46.803 --> 30:48.388
I don't think

30:48.429 --> 30:50.974
I've seen you smile
in ages.

30:51.015 --> 30:53.393
Well, it was
a really bad day,

30:53.434 --> 30:56.312
but then Mom had this brill idea
to go ice skating.

30:56.354 --> 30:58.648
It was amazing.
Ha ha! Then she,

30:58.690 --> 30:59.858
she totally fell.

30:59.899 --> 31:01.609
It was, like, a YouTube moment.

31:01.651 --> 31:03.820
And then we pigged out
at Serendipity.

31:03.862 --> 31:06.197
It was fun.

31:06.239 --> 31:07.699
We should go sometime.

31:07.740 --> 31:08.992
It'd be fun.

31:09.033 --> 31:10.910
Sounds good.

31:18.167 --> 31:20.378
I'll call the attorneys
in the morning.

31:22.255 --> 31:24.340
That's
the right thing.

31:30.054 --> 31:31.806
OLIVIA:
While most hedge funds suffered

31:31.848 --> 31:33.016
significant loss,

31:33.057 --> 31:34.475
you'll see our
stellar earnings

31:34.517 --> 31:36.603
in the reports
in front of you.

31:41.441 --> 31:44.027
Your bottom line
looks promising.

31:46.487 --> 31:48.197
Are there any questions

31:48.239 --> 31:50.116
I can answer for
you, Mr. Arbogast?

31:50.158 --> 31:51.826
Tim.

31:51.868 --> 31:54.120
Tim.

31:54.162 --> 31:55.997
Can you assure me

31:56.039 --> 31:58.416
my money's in good hands?

31:58.458 --> 32:01.252
Absolutely. We offer
liquidity within...

32:01.294 --> 32:02.670
Not you.

32:02.712 --> 32:04.005
I'd like to hear from Henry.

32:08.718 --> 32:11.804
The numbers don't lie, Tim.

32:18.686 --> 32:21.981
We'll start with a reasonable
amount and work our way up.

32:22.023 --> 32:24.108
My office will draw up
the paperwork.

32:31.491 --> 32:33.660
Give me the photo.

32:35.119 --> 32:36.537
This is the only one.

32:36.579 --> 32:37.747
You can erase it yourself
if you like.

32:37.789 --> 32:39.874
Why should I
believe you?

32:39.916 --> 32:43.086
I may be opportunistic,
but I'm not a liar.

32:43.127 --> 32:46.506
You can check
my "sent" history.

32:46.547 --> 32:49.342
No one's seen this photo
except for you.

33:11.572 --> 33:14.033
-Morning, Ms. Farrell.
-Hey.

33:15.493 --> 33:19.038
So, I called
the Army Reserves.

33:19.080 --> 33:21.916
I spoke to your former
commanding officer.

33:21.958 --> 33:24.127
I wanted recommendation.

33:24.168 --> 33:26.754
She told me you were
a true war hero.

33:26.796 --> 33:30.341
Um...okay.

33:30.383 --> 33:32.010
Why did you need
to know that?

33:32.051 --> 33:34.762
I needed to know if
I could trust you.

33:34.804 --> 33:36.681
Hey, you've been
in my car all week.

33:36.723 --> 33:38.349
You still don't
trust my driving?

33:38.391 --> 33:41.019
Not your driving.

33:41.060 --> 33:43.146
Your discretion.

33:43.187 --> 33:46.149
I want to hire you
to protect me.

33:46.190 --> 33:47.942
Protect you from what?

33:49.819 --> 33:51.904
Somebody's trying
to kill me.

33:51.946 --> 33:53.990
Excuse me?

33:54.032 --> 33:56.367
I took this ride
to get answers.

33:56.409 --> 33:59.579
But all I got were
more questions.

33:59.620 --> 34:01.372
What do you say?

34:01.414 --> 34:04.167
Will you help me, Solomon?

34:04.208 --> 34:06.753
[elevator bell dings]

34:56.469 --> 34:58.846
ANDREW: I didn't
realize you were home.

34:58.888 --> 35:00.431
Why are the lights off?

35:03.226 --> 35:05.520
[sighs]
We settled.

35:11.275 --> 35:12.652
Okay.

35:12.693 --> 35:15.154
Thank you for
talking me into it.

35:15.196 --> 35:16.489
I agree.

35:16.531 --> 35:18.282
It's the right thing
to do.

35:26.040 --> 35:28.209
Is everything okay?

35:28.251 --> 35:30.044
You don't look
too good.

35:30.086 --> 35:32.046
Excuse me?

35:32.088 --> 35:35.466
Uh, n...I just meant
something's a bit off.

35:35.508 --> 35:37.093
Don't be offended.

35:37.135 --> 35:38.761
We've all lost sleep
over this trial.

35:38.803 --> 35:40.680
Hey, have you
heard from Juliet?

35:40.721 --> 35:42.807
I thought it'd be nice
if we all had dinner
together tonight.

35:47.728 --> 35:49.313
Where are you going?

35:51.107 --> 35:53.276
[elevator bell dings]

35:53.317 --> 35:56.904
JULIET: Do you want
chocolate or marzipan?

35:56.946 --> 35:58.823
I'm sorry.
What's marzipan?

35:58.865 --> 36:00.283
Oh, God, you're
so ghetto.

36:00.324 --> 36:01.909
Here.

36:03.452 --> 36:05.997
[knock on door]

36:06.038 --> 36:07.874
I'll get it.

36:19.135 --> 36:21.137
Do you know
how hard it is

36:21.179 --> 36:23.639
to find a good liquor store
in Midtown?

36:23.681 --> 36:26.601
I still can't believe
we pulled this off.

36:26.642 --> 36:29.729
-For you.
-Thanks.

36:29.770 --> 36:32.523
So, who wants to toast
to being millionaires?

36:32.565 --> 36:33.733
I do.

36:33.774 --> 36:36.194
I do.

36:36.235 --> 36:38.321
JULIET: Here's to spending
Daddy's money.

36:44.285 --> 36:45.870
Ahh.

36:45.912 --> 36:47.205
Ahh.

36:51.125 --> 36:53.336
TESSA: Whoa. Whiskey
does not mix with wine.

36:53.377 --> 36:55.630
[laughing]

36:55.671 --> 36:57.506
Good job at
the courthouse,
by the way.

36:57.548 --> 36:59.550
Oh, thanks. You, too.

36:59.592 --> 37:02.136
The tears were a nice touch.

37:02.178 --> 37:03.971
Well, it's easy to cry
when there's this
much cash involved.

37:04.013 --> 37:07.099
So, how did you get
Andrea to squeal?

37:07.141 --> 37:09.143
Oh, it was easy.
She's got a bleeding heart

37:09.185 --> 37:10.937
and a tiny bladder.

37:10.978 --> 37:12.939
We just followed her
into the bathroom.

37:12.980 --> 37:14.398
And pretended that
we were alone...

37:14.440 --> 37:16.567
Then played the whole

37:16.609 --> 37:19.946
Tessa's-not-gonna-testify
bit.

37:19.987 --> 37:21.864
Hey, Tessa, wait!

37:21.906 --> 37:23.866
Tessa!

37:26.369 --> 37:28.162
Juliet?

37:28.204 --> 37:29.789
Mr. Martin?

37:29.830 --> 37:31.499
I have something
major to tell you.

37:31.540 --> 37:32.917
[laughs]

37:32.959 --> 37:35.461
And she
basically ran out
and squealed.

37:35.503 --> 37:37.797
Just like...

37:37.838 --> 37:39.966
I'm glad we didn't have
to bring her in on it.

37:40.007 --> 37:41.968
We're already splitting this
three ways.

37:42.009 --> 37:44.220
So mean.

37:44.262 --> 37:46.555
[giggling]
Don't spill.

37:46.597 --> 37:49.433
To getting your
trust fund back.

37:49.475 --> 37:52.395
What? I thought this
is what you wanted?

37:52.436 --> 37:53.604
It is.

37:53.646 --> 37:55.064
Well,
let's celebrate.

37:55.106 --> 37:57.108
Okay.

38:03.447 --> 38:05.825
Looking for something?

38:05.866 --> 38:09.203
Yeah, a silver key ring
in the shape of a boat.

38:09.245 --> 38:10.788
Have you seen it?

38:10.830 --> 38:12.456
No.

38:12.498 --> 38:14.041
Well, has
anyone else been in
the apartment today?

38:14.083 --> 38:16.043
I mean, other than you
and Juliet?

38:16.085 --> 38:18.212
Not that I'm aware of.

38:18.254 --> 38:19.797
Are you all right?

38:19.839 --> 38:21.716
Yeah, I'm just
confused. Why?

38:21.757 --> 38:24.635
Earlier, you just seemed
a bit distant,

38:24.677 --> 38:26.637
like I'd done something
to upset you.

38:26.679 --> 38:29.348
[sighs]

38:29.390 --> 38:30.850
I'm sorry.

38:30.891 --> 38:33.269
I've just been
a little distracted.

38:33.311 --> 38:34.687
Are you sure?

38:44.905 --> 38:47.158
Okay, now I believe you.

38:50.161 --> 38:52.872
[phones ringing,
indistinct P.A. announcements]

39:01.130 --> 39:03.716
[sighing]
I'm gonna have to
go back to Paris.

39:03.758 --> 39:05.301
Bridget's getting too
close to the truth.

39:05.343 --> 39:07.470
I'm gonna have to get that
information from Tyler.

39:07.511 --> 39:08.846
Well, I'm coming with.

39:08.888 --> 39:10.514
I need you to stay here.

39:10.556 --> 39:12.099
You have to keep
an eye on her.

39:12.141 --> 39:13.726
Make sure she doesn't
keep screwing things up.

39:13.768 --> 39:15.895
Look, I don't want to
be away from you again.

39:15.936 --> 39:18.272
It's only temporary.

39:20.316 --> 39:22.068
I didn't even ask you.

39:22.109 --> 39:23.569
How were drinks with
your father-in-law?

39:23.611 --> 39:25.112
Um, they were good.

39:25.154 --> 39:26.530
They were fine.

39:26.572 --> 39:29.158
I got him to invest
in Martin/Charles.

39:29.200 --> 39:30.910
You did what?

39:30.951 --> 39:34.080
Wh...What is it?
What did I say?

39:34.121 --> 39:36.248
It's what you did.
Why would you let him
invest in Martin/Charles?

39:36.290 --> 39:37.917
I-It was Olivia.

39:37.958 --> 39:39.877
She has a photograph
of us from my phone

39:39.919 --> 39:41.462
that she stole, and she was
gonna use it to blackmail me.

39:41.504 --> 39:44.048
So, I was trying
to protect us.

39:44.090 --> 39:45.633
Do what you asked.

39:45.674 --> 39:47.301
You should've come
to me first.

39:58.312 --> 40:00.523
[beeps]

40:02.525 --> 40:03.943
Yeah, hi.

40:03.984 --> 40:05.778
This is Tyler Barrett
from Banque Trésonne.

40:05.820 --> 40:09.323
You did an audit of my firm
a couple months ago.

40:09.365 --> 40:13.953
Well, I have reason to believe
there might be some...

40:13.994 --> 40:17.164
less than scrupulous activity
going on in my company.

40:17.206 --> 40:20.334
What exactly are we
looking for?

40:20.376 --> 40:23.045
[sighs]
I don't know.

40:23.087 --> 40:25.131
Anything that might
give us a clue

40:25.172 --> 40:27.258
as to who's trying
to kill me.

40:27.299 --> 40:29.218
Uh, I'll do the desk,

40:29.260 --> 40:31.178
and then if you want
to check the closet,

40:31.220 --> 40:33.264
there's a ton of
boxes in there.

40:48.487 --> 40:50.406
What are you looking at?

40:50.448 --> 40:52.074
Were you in this
closet two days ago?

40:52.116 --> 40:54.994
No, I mean, I-I looked in
it, but I didn't go into it.

40:59.498 --> 41:01.083
Are those footprints?

41:01.125 --> 41:03.711
High heels, toes
facing out.

41:03.752 --> 41:06.005
Which means...

41:06.046 --> 41:08.799
Looks like the
person--this woman--

41:08.841 --> 41:10.843
didn't come in here
to get something out
of the closet.

41:10.885 --> 41:13.012
She planted herself.

41:13.053 --> 41:15.973
Almost as if...

41:16.015 --> 41:17.975
she was watching you.

41:18.017 --> 41:21.520
Your father-in-law's about
to lose a lot of money.

41:21.562 --> 41:23.939
All right, Siobhan, what
are you talking about?

41:42.750 --> 41:44.418
Oh, my God.
