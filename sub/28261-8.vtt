Previously on "Pretty Little
Liars: The Perfectionists.."

00:02.336 --> 00:04.588
(Mona)
Somebody left me
a box of cupcakes last night.

00:04.588 --> 00:06.715
They used Nolan's ID card
to accessWy apartment.

00:06.715 --> 00:08.550
- How would you know that?
- I stole Taylor's RV.

00:08.550 --> 00:10.510
I wanted you to know
what I was using it for

00:10.510 --> 00:11.678
so you know you could trust me.

00:11.678 --> 00:13.013
When people wanna know
who you are

00:13.013 --> 00:15.432
if you're honest
there are no wrong answers.

00:15.432 --> 00:18.060
(Alison)
I convinced myself that
I came here with a clean slate.

00:18.060 --> 00:19.645
(female #1)
I think you moved on

00:19.645 --> 00:21.521
you just never said it
out loud.

00:21.521 --> 00:22.689
I'm not the one who paired us..

00:22.689 --> 00:24.524
- Forced.
- ...together.

00:24.524 --> 00:26.568
Since Nolan's death
I've been distracted.

00:26.568 --> 00:28.362
There must be something
you'd do to relax.

00:28.362 --> 00:30.656
- Music is the art of math.
- Well said, Amadeus.

00:30.656 --> 00:32.491
If Professor James finds out
that I can't play

00:32.491 --> 00:34.117
it could jeopardize
my scholarship

00:34.117 --> 00:36.286
It's a problem
that I'm trying to fix.

00:36.286 --> 00:38.497
I told you I don't wanna be
a part of your shortcut.

00:38.497 --> 00:39.831
I worked on this all night.

00:39.831 --> 00:41.583
You didn't have to include
my name on it, though.

00:41.583 --> 00:43.377
Well, I wouldn't have solved
the puzzle without you.

00:43.377 --> 00:45.462
- Chess is the art of math.
- Wait..

00:45.462 --> 00:46.964
- You're Bad Bishop.
- You're 4Moves.

00:46.964 --> 00:48.548
I did something really bad
that could get me

00:48.548 --> 00:50.592
kicked out of the school
and Dana knows it.

00:50.592 --> 00:52.427
You were right
about Dana Booker.

00:52.427 --> 00:53.512
She left me those cupcakes.

00:53.512 --> 00:54.888
She's playing your game.

00:54.888 --> 00:56.473
Then I'll win.

00:56.473 --> 00:58.100
Let's take this bitch down.

01:00.852 --> 01:02.479
(Mona)
So now that we know
Dana is our A

01:02.479 --> 01:05.357
we have to find out as much
about her as possible.

01:05.357 --> 01:06.566
You wanna profile her.

01:06.566 --> 01:08.694
I did a report on criminal
psychology last year

01:08.694 --> 01:10.821
and in order to catch
a psychopath

01:10.821 --> 01:12.531
you wanna identify
their personality

01:12.531 --> 01:14.408
behavioral traits so you can
know what kind of psychopath

01:14.408 --> 01:15.617
you're dealing with.

01:15.617 --> 01:17.744
Thank you, Spencer.

01:17.744 --> 01:19.663
- I'm Caitlin.
- Yeah, I know.

01:19.663 --> 01:20.831
And we caught a break because

01:20.831 --> 01:23.292
it's Staff and Faculty
Appreciation Day.

01:23.292 --> 01:24.626
Yeah, which is all about
celebrating

01:24.626 --> 01:26.628
and getting to know
your fellow staff members.

01:26.628 --> 01:28.839
(Caitlin)
'And you plan
to get to know Dana.'

01:28.839 --> 01:30.966
Now, Dana has full access
to Beacon Guard

01:30.966 --> 01:33.385
so keep all confidential
conversations

01:33.385 --> 01:34.761
out of public restrooms.

01:34.761 --> 01:37.556
They're spying on us
in the bathrooms?

01:37.556 --> 01:38.765
How do you know that?

01:38.765 --> 01:40.559
When you spend enough time
watching people

01:40.559 --> 01:41.727
you know
when you're being watched.

01:41.727 --> 01:43.395
'When they realized
I figured it out'

01:43.395 --> 01:46.148
they brought me in and told me
to keep my mouth shut.

01:46.148 --> 01:48.150
Until now, that's what I did.

01:48.150 --> 01:49.818
The cameras are there
to protect us

01:49.818 --> 01:52.571
but let's not give Dana
anything to use against us.

01:52.571 --> 01:54.489
She already has something on me.

01:54.489 --> 01:55.699
I might've screwed up.

01:55.699 --> 01:58.118
- You definitely screwed up.
- Definitely.

02:01.246 --> 02:03.665
I submitted the cello piece
as my own to Professor James

02:03.665 --> 02:05.167
'and I think
Dana knows about it.'

02:05.167 --> 02:07.085
- Oh, she knows about it.
- Definitely.

02:07.085 --> 02:08.837
Why did you cheat?

02:08.837 --> 02:10.714
That can't keep being
the answer for you, Dylan.

02:10.714 --> 02:13.258
I know it was stupid, alright?
But I felt backed into a corner.

02:13.258 --> 02:15.677
You just handed Dana
another huge chunk of leverage.

02:15.677 --> 02:18.722
I know, but I-I physically
could not play. Okay?

02:18.722 --> 02:20.098
We have a plan.

02:20.098 --> 02:22.142
I'm gonna use Caitlin's new
friend Jeremy's computer

02:22.142 --> 02:24.102
''cause it won't be
traceable back to BHU.'

02:24.102 --> 02:26.521
So, I'll hack into the portal
and I'll delete the file

02:26.521 --> 02:28.899
before Professor James
can see it.

02:28.899 --> 02:30.400
You can do that?

02:30.400 --> 02:32.736
- Yeah, of course.
- Nice.

02:32.736 --> 02:33.779
Alright, well,
you take care of that

02:33.779 --> 02:35.447
and I will find out as much

02:35.447 --> 02:37.282
about Dana as humanly possible.

02:37.282 --> 02:39.659
It's not all bad news.

02:39.659 --> 02:41.787
We have another player
on our side.

02:41.787 --> 02:43.580
Taylor.

02:43.580 --> 02:46.249
So, now you think
we can trust her?

02:46.249 --> 02:47.709
I grew up with Taylor.

02:47.709 --> 02:48.919
She loved her brother
more than anything.

02:48.919 --> 02:51.380
And she's back because
she wants to find out

02:51.380 --> 02:52.589
who killed Nolan.

02:52.589 --> 02:53.673
We all do.

02:53.673 --> 02:54.674
You know the drill.

You know,
asking me if I'm done

03:24.287 --> 03:26.415
every 60 seconds
is actually slowing me down.

03:26.415 --> 03:28.375
Slowing you down, as in,
like, it's not going to work?

03:28.375 --> 03:29.584
Or it will eventually work?

03:29.584 --> 03:30.669
- Or what's--
- Make him stop.

03:30.669 --> 03:32.546
So, Dylan,
if Ava deletes your upload

03:32.546 --> 03:34.089
you're still getting
an incomplete.

03:34.089 --> 03:35.715
- "If?"
- When.

03:35.715 --> 03:37.050
I will take an incomplete,
I don't care

03:37.050 --> 03:38.677
about an incomplete,
I'll double up on a class

03:38.677 --> 03:40.095
next semester.

03:40.095 --> 03:41.721
This is better
than being expelled.

03:41.721 --> 03:44.850
Hey, how well do you know
your new friend Jeremy?

03:44.850 --> 03:45.976
Uh, why?

03:45.976 --> 03:47.561
Well, I can access his browser

03:47.561 --> 03:48.728
to remove the upload

03:48.728 --> 03:50.689
but some of the files

03:50.689 --> 03:53.191
on this hard drive are,
like, mega-encrypted.

03:53.942 --> 03:55.110
Super lockdown.

03:55.110 --> 03:57.028
It's pretty unusual
for a personal computer.

03:57.028 --> 03:59.197
Maybe he was doing
some Hotchkiss work at home.

03:59.197 --> 04:00.782
Well, if that was the case
he'd be required

04:00.782 --> 04:01.825
to use Hotchkiss' encryption.

04:01.825 --> 04:03.618

04:09.916 --> 04:12.836

04:16.923 --> 04:18.758

04:23.180 --> 04:26.850
I'd really love to know what
your friend does at Hotchkiss.

Did you miss me?

It has been quiet.

04:56.296 --> 05:00.592
So welcome to my unofficial

05:00.592 --> 05:01.968
I've been in your shoes.

05:01.968 --> 05:04.763
It's best to get all the stares

05:05.889 --> 05:07.807
How's it been with your mom?

She's been trying really hard.

05:09.809 --> 05:13.355
She wants to take care of me
almost to a fault.

Claire won't leave my side.

05:15.482 --> 05:18.235
That's why I haven't been
able to help you.

05:18.235 --> 05:20.070
Have you been able
to find out anything else

05:20.070 --> 05:22.989
about the investigation?
About Dana Booker?

05:22.989 --> 05:24.699
My mother thinks
I'm far too fragile

05:24.699 --> 05:26.451
to talk about Nolan or Dana.

05:26.451 --> 05:27.827
Dana is playing
a dangerous game

05:27.827 --> 05:29.621
that we all know too well.

05:29.621 --> 05:30.997
But Mona has a plan.

05:30.997 --> 05:32.874
She's gonna use this afternoon's
speed round game

05:32.874 --> 05:34.543
to get inside Dana's head.

05:34.543 --> 05:35.585
Speed round?

05:35.585 --> 05:36.711
It's a Q and A

05:36.711 --> 05:38.380
for faculty and staff.

05:38.380 --> 05:39.965
Like, speed dating.

05:39.965 --> 05:42.008
Mona's crafted a series of
questions

05:42.008 --> 05:44.844
that are designed to get a
baseline psych profile on Dana.

05:44.844 --> 05:47.472
It'll start easy
and get more personal.

05:47.472 --> 05:49.391
You know, like the FBI does.

05:49.391 --> 05:52.018
I get it, you cannot
defeat your enemies until--

05:52.018 --> 05:54.020
Until you know who they are.
