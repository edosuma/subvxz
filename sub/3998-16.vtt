00:00.320 --> 00:01.220
Hey, guys.

00:01.280 --> 00:02.400
Bertie's playing it cool,

00:02.460 --> 00:04.000
but you guys coming over
for dinner tonight

00:04.080 --> 00:06.900
is a really big deal to her, so...

00:06.980 --> 00:08.760
Be there by 6, and no bailing.

00:08.860 --> 00:10.220
Ooh, bailing on dinner.

00:10.260 --> 00:11.520
Nick, I need you.

00:11.560 --> 00:12.730
Wingman sitch.

00:12.760 --> 00:13.860
Jewish girl, sensible nose.

00:13.890 --> 00:14.860
High-level target.

00:14.890 --> 00:15.890
I can't be your wingman.

00:15.930 --> 00:17.560
We got to go this Bertie dinner.

00:17.600 --> 00:19.030
Don't make it seem
like a chore, okay?

00:19.070 --> 00:20.970
She is making ten or eleven soups.

00:21.000 --> 00:22.940
And all of them are cream-based.

00:22.970 --> 00:24.400
Cool.

00:24.440 --> 00:25.940
Hey, Mom.

00:25.970 --> 00:27.970
Hi, baby, I'm sorry to interrupt.

00:28.010 --> 00:30.540
I know the morning is
the most sensual time of day.

00:30.580 --> 00:32.310
But, um, I need you.
It's your sister.

00:32.350 --> 00:34.350
Abby? What is it?

00:34.380 --> 00:37.280
She was arrested
at a hotel in San Diego.

00:37.320 --> 00:38.120
How's everything
with your sister?

00:38.150 --> 00:39.690
I mean, she was caught stealing,

00:39.720 --> 00:41.390
they called the cops, it's a mess.

00:41.420 --> 00:43.720
Imagine me next door with a,
with a nice Jewish girl.

00:43.760 --> 00:45.220
- Hey, Jess has a sister?
- Yeah, I've never met her.

00:45.260 --> 00:46.730
I need you to go to the jail,

00:46.760 --> 00:48.460
pick her up
and put her on a plane home.

00:48.500 --> 00:50.560
- Oh, that's fabulous.
- And by the way, um...

00:50.600 --> 00:51.860
I don't know
what kind of jail this is.

00:51.900 --> 00:53.400
So be prepared for anything.

00:53.430 --> 00:55.370
I mean, wear a shirt
you don't love-love.

00:55.400 --> 00:57.000
- Okay.
- Love you.

00:57.040 --> 00:58.740
Hi Nick...

00:58.770 --> 01:01.370
Okay, here, these are all the
ladles that I could find.

01:01.410 --> 01:04.910
Ooh, this one is deep.

01:04.940 --> 01:06.150
Well, what's up with your sister?

01:06.180 --> 01:08.310
Well, she's coming to town.

01:08.350 --> 01:09.310
- Great!
- Ooh, yikes, that's...

01:09.350 --> 01:10.850
The best news ever? I know!

01:10.880 --> 01:15.090
It's so, so, so, so, so, so,

01:15.120 --> 01:16.500
so good.

01:21.760 --> 01:24.930
Well, I can't wait to meet
the mysterious Abby Day.

01:24.960 --> 01:26.500
Not mysterious.

01:26.530 --> 01:27.730
Jet setter.

01:27.770 --> 01:29.000
You know, I always imagined her

01:29.040 --> 01:30.500
with a French-speaking
black husband,

01:30.540 --> 01:33.010
like a Jerome St. Pierre.

01:33.040 --> 01:34.010
So, I'll probably meet
her at the airport

01:34.040 --> 01:35.640
for a little layover hang.

01:35.680 --> 01:36.640
- Why are you ignoring me, Nick?
- 'Cause I'm paying

01:36.680 --> 01:37.780
- Nick!
- attention to my girlfriend.

01:37.810 --> 01:39.610
There, a reaction!
Thank goodness!

01:39.650 --> 01:41.580
Now I know I'm not a ghost.

01:41.610 --> 01:42.950
- All right, I got to go.
- Oh, you're going...?

01:42.980 --> 01:44.580
I'll, uh, I-I got to go.

01:44.620 --> 01:45.880
Hey, hey, hey, hey, Jess, Jess!

01:45.920 --> 01:47.290
What if I came with?

01:47.320 --> 01:48.550
Yeah, you know, I don't think

01:48.590 --> 01:50.460
- you two would really get along.
- Why not?

01:50.490 --> 01:52.390
Look, I just haven't seen her
in a really long time, and...

01:52.430 --> 01:54.260
Jess, I'd like to meet your sister.

01:55.430 --> 01:57.230
Why don't we do this? Um...

01:57.260 --> 01:58.800
Why don't I go pick her up? And then

01:58.830 --> 02:01.730
come meet us for a quick dinner
before she leaves?

02:01.770 --> 02:04.240
That would be awesome. That's all
I was looking for. - Yeah. Okay.

02:04.270 --> 02:05.970
- Winston, we can't make your dinner!
- Bye, Winston.

02:06.010 --> 02:07.110
- I'm not gonna be with you.
- Wait!

02:07.140 --> 02:08.810
No, no, no, no! Wait...

02:08.840 --> 02:10.580
Hey, hey.

02:10.610 --> 02:12.240
Are you really
letting Nick meet Abby?

02:12.280 --> 02:14.310
Hell no. I'm going to
pick her up from jail.

02:14.350 --> 02:16.580
Like, straight-up jail.

02:16.620 --> 02:19.250
I told Nick he could meet
her on her "layover"

02:19.290 --> 02:22.650
but, whoops, her flight
got changed. No time. Sorry.

02:22.690 --> 02:24.920
- Bye, Nick! I'll see you later!
- I'm out of shampoo!

02:24.960 --> 02:27.160
Gonna use bar soap! But your sister
won't know the difference!

02:27.190 --> 02:29.260
Okay! Can't wait
for you to meet her!

02:29.300 --> 02:31.630
He's never going to meet her.

02:32.830 --> 02:34.600
Hey, dude. I can't go

02:34.630 --> 02:36.170
to this dinner.
It's a double date now.

02:36.200 --> 02:38.170
Things are already weird enough
between me and Cece.

02:38.200 --> 02:39.440
Because you went on a date
two months ago

02:39.470 --> 02:41.140
and she never texted you?

02:41.170 --> 02:41.670
Yeah.

02:43.210 --> 02:45.640
- Be a man, Coach!
- All right.

02:45.680 --> 02:48.410
Be there by 6:00
and bring a bottle of wine.

02:48.450 --> 02:51.780
And don't be cheap, either.
Bertie is a Somalian.

02:51.820 --> 02:54.650
Okay.

02:54.690 --> 02:56.420
Oh, tidings, Abigail.

02:56.460 --> 02:58.820
I'm Jess's beau.
My name is Nicholas.

02:58.860 --> 03:00.660
- It's a pleasure to...
- Oh, good God.

03:00.690 --> 03:02.630
- Is that a common barber's comb?
- Look, Schmidt,

03:02.660 --> 03:04.700
I just want to make a good
impression on Jess's sister.

03:04.730 --> 03:06.500
Yeah, well, I want
Julia Child not to be dead,

03:06.530 --> 03:08.300
but here we find ourselves.

03:08.330 --> 03:09.540
What did you come here
to talk to me about?

03:09.570 --> 03:11.140
As I was saying earlier,

03:11.170 --> 03:12.970
I have a very difficult
flirting situation here.

03:13.010 --> 03:15.170
I mean, it's a double
black diamond: trees, moguls.

03:15.210 --> 03:16.610
And, as we both know,
you're the best

03:16.640 --> 03:17.880
wingman who's ever wung.

03:17.910 --> 03:19.480
Thank you, Schmidt!

03:19.510 --> 03:20.880
I'm almost glad
I got in the accident

03:20.910 --> 03:22.380
so we can have more days
like this together,

03:22.420 --> 03:23.950
with you helping me
through this.

03:23.980 --> 03:27.050
Hocod a guy so rich be
so generous with his time?

03:27.090 --> 03:28.320
Whoa...

03:28.350 --> 03:30.320
Excuse me.
Are you the writer

03:30.360 --> 03:33.630
<i>of So You've Mastered
the Female Orgasm, Now What?</i>

03:33.660 --> 03:35.290
- Incredible. Can I have your autograph?
- Of course.

03:35.330 --> 03:36.830
Come on, man. It's a quick party.

03:36.860 --> 03:38.200
- I'll have you back by your little dinner.
- Okay, I'll do it,

03:38.230 --> 03:40.870
but as soon as Jess says
I've got to go, I'm out.

03:40.890 --> 03:42.470
Thank you very much.
For your mitigated support

03:42.500 --> 03:43.870
and tiny portion of your life.

03:43.900 --> 03:45.270
- Sure.
- Okay.

03:46.870 --> 03:48.240
Hey, Abby.

03:48.270 --> 03:50.980
Oh, look who came to pick up
her big, bad sister.

03:51.010 --> 03:53.850
So, you good to go? Or you gotta
sign yearbooks or something?

03:54.880 --> 03:56.420
Bridget stole your gum.

03:56.450 --> 03:59.420
What? You took
my Fruity Fruit?

03:59.450 --> 04:02.220
I ain't got your
Fruity Fruit, bitch!

04:02.260 --> 04:03.590
- Oh, my God. Oh...
- Gum?

04:05.730 --> 04:07.060
I want my Fruity Fruit!

04:07.090 --> 04:09.390
I ain't got
your Fruity Fruit, bitch!

04:11.530 --> 04:13.530
What about the new guy?
I want to meet him.

04:13.570 --> 04:15.370
We don't really have time to meet
him 'cause I have to take you

04:15.400 --> 04:17.240
to the airport 'cause Mom's
already bought you a ticket.

04:17.269 --> 04:19.740
I know all
of her credit card information,

04:19.769 --> 04:21.240
- No.
- and I can just change it.

04:21.269 --> 04:23.510
- Wait, what are you doing? Wait, no.
- Sweet.

04:23.540 --> 04:25.540
Why don't you just for once
in your life do something

04:25.580 --> 04:27.380
that you're not supposed to do?

04:27.410 --> 04:29.720
I didn't put the cap back on
the honey bear the other day.

04:29.750 --> 04:31.880
- Drive. Drive. Drive.
- Oh, my God. No! No!

04:31.920 --> 04:34.720
- No! No! I will not drive unsafely!
- Try-try it!

04:34.750 --> 04:37.260
I have a perfect record.
Get your hands away from me.

04:38.460 --> 04:40.290
- Why don't you want me to meet him?
- About.

04:40.330 --> 04:42.290
- Are you embarrassed of me?
- I do. No.

04:42.330 --> 04:44.460
- Great. 'Cause I just got on a later flight.
- That's great.

04:44.500 --> 04:47.930
- So excited.
- I know.

04:47.970 --> 04:50.370
Did you just start driving really slow?

04:50.400 --> 04:51.640
No, I actually think I'm speeding.

04:51.670 --> 04:52.900
I hope there's no coppers around.

04:52.940 --> 04:56.240
Drive faster.

04:56.280 --> 04:58.610
Sorry, sir!
Thank you for your service!

05:03.960 --> 05:06.190
- What is this place?
- It's a bar mitzvah.

05:06.220 --> 05:08.860
I am not watching
a kid get circumcised.

05:08.890 --> 05:11.160
The target is Rachael.
She's a Hebrew school teacher.

05:11.200 --> 05:12.760
Crashing some random kid's
bar mitzvah's

05:12.800 --> 05:14.330
the best way to get her?

05:14.370 --> 05:16.600
Get her on the dance floor,
a little bit softer now,

05:16.630 --> 05:19.600
a little bit louder now,
sweep her off her feet,

05:19.640 --> 05:21.440
we'll get married,
we'll have a son named Elon.

05:21.470 --> 05:23.610
At his bar mitzvah, I tell
the story of how I met his mom

05:23.640 --> 05:25.780
at this bar mitzvah.
Not a dry eye in the house.

05:25.810 --> 05:28.180
Jewiontinuity,
et cetera, et cetera.

05:28.210 --> 05:30.110
Do you realize how long
you were just talking?

05:30.150 --> 05:32.850
There she is. Whew!

05:32.880 --> 05:35.190
<i>- A beautiful piece of hamentaschen.
- What the hell is hamentaschen?</i>

05:35.220 --> 05:37.020
Problem is her dad is my rabbi.

05:37.050 --> 05:39.420
He hates me. So I just need
to charm Rachael

05:39.460 --> 05:41.960
before he gets to her and tells
her horrible-slash-true things

05:41.990 --> 05:43.130
- about me.
- Absolutely.

05:43.160 --> 05:43.990
Oh! Hello!

05:44.030 --> 05:46.400
- What a day.
- Oh...

05:46.430 --> 05:48.870
a special day.
Oh, take my hand.

05:48.900 --> 05:52.040
- Take your hand.
- A special day.

05:52.070 --> 05:54.100
You just wanted to take my hand so
you could say that again, didn't you?

05:54.140 --> 05:55.610
Mmm, I did.

05:55.640 --> 05:57.370
I don't think we've had
the pleasure of meeting.

05:57.410 --> 06:00.540
May I take your hand, too?

06:00.580 --> 06:02.110
You can take anything you want, Shirley.

06:03.280 --> 06:05.680
So, yeah, just the...

06:05.720 --> 06:09.020
just the two of us with
Bertie and Winston tonight?

06:09.050 --> 06:12.020
Yeah, just, uh...
just-just you and me.

06:12.060 --> 06:14.520
Uh, and Bertie. And Winston.

06:14.560 --> 06:17.860
- Just... eating night lunch.
- Yeah, like a...

06:17.900 --> 06:20.230
you know, like a date.
But not a date 'cause...

06:20.260 --> 06:21.630
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

06:21.670 --> 06:24.470
So, uh...

06:24.500 --> 06:27.700
- What is that? Is that a onesie?
- Yeah.

06:27.740 --> 06:29.640
How do you... how do you take it
off to use the bathroom?

06:29.670 --> 06:31.310
Mmm...

06:32.740 --> 06:35.650
Whoa. Nice place.

06:35.680 --> 06:37.780
- Oh, my God!
- Hey!

06:37.820 --> 06:42.150
- You look, you know, amazing.
- You look amazing. Look at you.

06:42.190 --> 06:45.260
Oh, my God. I'm so happy you're
not just paper-thin anymore.

06:45.290 --> 06:48.160
Oh, my God.
You're just the best.

06:48.190 --> 06:50.990
Hello, Hot Cocoa. Whoa.

06:51.030 --> 06:55.070
- What's going on here? I'm getting
a real vibe. - Nothing.

06:55.100 --> 06:56.330
- No.
- Mmm,

06:56.370 --> 06:58.900
you want to have sex with her,

06:58.940 --> 07:01.810
you... are not so sure.

07:03.770 --> 07:06.180
If she doesn't want
to put out, I will.

07:06.210 --> 07:08.350

- There you go.

07:08.380 --> 07:10.980

07:17.020 --> 07:18.460

Damn it.
She hasn't called.

07:26.230 --> 07:27.160
Will you put please that away?

07:27.200 --> 07:28.370
We're 30 seconds to curtain here.

07:28.400 --> 07:30.000
I don't want to miss a call
from Jess, man.

07:30.030 --> 07:31.640
I need you focused.
Are you ready?

07:31.670 --> 07:34.670
Yes. I distract the rabbi
while you hit on his daughter.

07:34.710 --> 07:35.570
And action. Go.

07:37.740 --> 07:38.680
Ugh.

07:38.710 --> 07:39.680
What a spread, huh?

07:39.710 --> 07:40.640
- Terrible.
- I agree.

07:40.680 --> 07:43.110
Thank God I have
pizza in my car.

07:43.150 --> 07:45.520
Yeah, that's very funny.

07:45.550 --> 07:46.820
What's the matter with you?
That wasn't a joke.

07:46.850 --> 07:48.720
Who has pizza in their car?

07:48.750 --> 07:49.990
Listen, when I make a joke,

07:50.020 --> 07:51.390
you'll know it.
I'm a joke machine.

07:51.420 --> 07:53.390
What are the chances?
I love jokes!

07:53.420 --> 07:55.060
Oh, good, okay.

07:55.090 --> 07:58.860
Uh... Oh, did you hear
the one about the waiter?

07:58.900 --> 08:01.900
- No. - Walks up to a table full
of Jewish women and says,

08:01.930 --> 08:04.370
<i>"Ladies, is anything all right?"</i>

08:09.140 --> 08:10.070
Hi.

08:10.110 --> 08:11.210
Rack-hael!

08:11.240 --> 08:13.980
<i>Baruch ata Ado, nice dress.</i>

08:14.010 --> 08:15.810
Oh, thank you!

08:15.850 --> 08:19.820
- Uh, Shabbat sha-hello.
- Yeah.

08:19.850 --> 08:23.650
- It wasn't as good as mine, but it was cute.
- Yeah. Thanks. Thanks.

08:23.690 --> 08:26.020
- How's Hebrew school?
- It's fine. It's the only place

08:26.060 --> 08:28.260
that would hire me after
I got out of rehab.

08:28.290 --> 08:32.230
- Two Jews walk into a bar. They buy it.
- 'Cause they're rich people.

08:32.260 --> 08:34.200
Yeah, they... well, these
particular Jews happen

08:34.230 --> 08:36.730
- to be rich, but they worked hard.
- I'm sorry. Hold on...

08:36.770 --> 08:38.900
- Telephone call in the middle
of a punch line? - Hey.

08:38.940 --> 08:40.770
- Generation's the worst!
- Hey, what's going on?

08:40.809 --> 08:43.610
So Abby's flight is crazy delayed.

08:43.640 --> 08:46.040
Um, so, no time for dinner.

08:46.080 --> 08:47.710
I can come right now, Jess.

08:47.750 --> 08:49.850
No. Um, she has, um,
a conference call

08:49.880 --> 08:51.380
with Hong Kong about a...

08:51.420 --> 08:52.850
very important, uh...

08:52.880 --> 08:55.450
fashion business, uh,
venture magazine...

08:55.490 --> 08:57.090
conference.

08:57.120 --> 09:00.560
Well, maybe I'll see her
next time.

09:01.560 --> 09:04.860
<i>Oh, no, no, no, no!</i>

09:04.900 --> 09:06.430
You will not speak to my daughter!

09:06.460 --> 09:09.030
Rachael, this man is a nut ball!

09:09.070 --> 09:12.300
A nut ball? How dare you!
I'm a goof ball.

09:12.340 --> 09:14.400
Sammy Davis, Jr. was a goof ball.

09:14.440 --> 09:17.510
You, sir,
are no Sammy Davis, Jr.

09:17.540 --> 09:20.240
- I'm a... I'm a goof ball. I am a goofball.
- You're bad news. Bad news.

09:20.280 --> 09:23.550
Daddy, I love sex, and he wants
to have sex with me.

09:23.580 --> 09:26.480
Let him!
Oh, I love sex!

09:26.520 --> 09:28.590
Text me. Text me.

09:30.820 --> 09:32.120
What was that, man?

09:32.160 --> 09:33.560
Jess is embarrassed of me.

09:33.590 --> 09:34.890
Can you believe that?

09:34.930 --> 09:37.160
What a shanda.
What's a shanda?

09:37.190 --> 09:38.730
A shanda!

09:38.760 --> 09:40.460
What a shanda!

09:40.500 --> 09:42.400
All you care about is Jess.

09:42.430 --> 09:44.330
Remember when we used
to be best friends?

09:44.370 --> 09:45.770
Uh, that was neat.

09:45.800 --> 09:48.240
What a neat time
in my life that was.

09:48.270 --> 09:50.170
Hey, Schmidt!

09:50.210 --> 09:52.180
My girlfriend's embarrassed of me.

09:52.210 --> 09:54.410
Can we go on that for a little bit?

09:54.450 --> 09:58.850
Or does the wingman never get
to, you know, flap his wings?

09:58.880 --> 10:01.680
The bird never gets
to be the main bird.

10:01.720 --> 10:03.490
This.

10:03.520 --> 10:05.520
Ugh!

10:05.560 --> 10:07.590
So, I just talked to Nick,

10:07.630 --> 10:09.790
and this is a real
shame in the pants,

10:09.830 --> 10:11.630
but he's not
coming home tonight.

10:11.660 --> 10:14.160
- What? Why?
- He had to hang out with his work friends.

10:14.200 --> 10:17.470
- He can't come and see me?
- Guess it's just us till... the airport.

10:17.500 --> 10:19.000
Mmm.

10:21.240 --> 10:23.040
You see what you're doing, right?

10:23.070 --> 10:24.840
Oh, my God.

10:24.880 --> 10:27.340
Mom.

10:27.380 --> 10:30.110
No! I'm turning into Mom.
How did this happen?

10:30.150 --> 10:31.980
- "Just a little bit."
- "Just a tipple."

10:32.020 --> 10:34.120
- "I don't want to get stoned."
- Hey, I love that

10:34.150 --> 10:36.720
she calls "getting drunk" "getting stoned."

10:36.750 --> 10:39.120
Oh, my God. Wait.
Big news. Mom got

10:39.160 --> 10:41.830
one of those very, very
small denim backpacks.

10:41.860 --> 10:44.360
- What?
- She did, and she calls it her blue guy.

10:44.400 --> 10:47.060
She's, like, "Oh, I got
to grab my blue guy."

10:47.100 --> 10:48.500
Can't believe
you're making fun of Mom.

10:48.530 --> 10:49.970
You're her perfect little baby.

10:50.000 --> 10:52.140
I'm... Hey, I'm...

10:52.170 --> 10:53.740
I'm not really a baby.

10:53.770 --> 10:55.410
You're a super grownup.

10:55.440 --> 10:57.240
Thank you.

10:58.610 --> 11:01.580
- Oh, my...
- What?

11:01.610 --> 11:03.910
I have a picture of Mom
wearing the backpack

11:03.950 --> 11:05.720
at her sign language
class graduation.

11:05.750 --> 11:07.650
- Oh.
- You have to see this.

11:07.690 --> 11:09.490
- No.
- It's amazing.

11:09.520 --> 11:10.850
I have it in a photo album.

11:12.000 --> 11:18.074

11:22.530 --> 11:23.930
Ooh, bonus shot of Dad

11:23.970 --> 11:25.900
getting a haircut
while eating spaghetti!

11:27.810 --> 11:30.470
Abby?

11:34.500 --> 11:36.930
Hey, Outside D,
have you seen a girl

11:36.970 --> 11:38.870
that looks like me,
but with chaos in her eyes?

11:38.900 --> 11:41.540
Sorry. I'm doing my taxes.

11:41.570 --> 11:45.310
Ooh! I'm taking in more
than I'm spending.

11:45.340 --> 11:47.810
Hey.

11:47.840 --> 11:49.710
Hey. How's it going with Abby?

11:49.750 --> 11:51.380
Yeah, you know, we were having
fun for once, and then...

11:51.410 --> 11:52.810
What happened?

11:52.850 --> 11:54.150
Tell me what happened.

11:54.180 --> 11:55.720
I will take care of it for you, baby.

11:59.490 --> 12:00.490
Baby?

12:00.520 --> 12:01.890
I got this.

12:01.920 --> 12:05.460
I got this myself. Thanks.

12:05.490 --> 12:06.990
Quick question.

12:07.030 --> 12:09.830
Is pee-pee a write-off?

12:12.870 --> 12:14.400
Hey.

12:14.440 --> 12:16.970
Not sure my body's
built for these chairs.

12:17.010 --> 12:19.140
It's a regular chair, man.

12:19.170 --> 12:21.140
Yeah.

12:21.180 --> 12:22.640
Hey, bub.

12:22.680 --> 12:24.310
How you doing?

12:24.350 --> 12:27.010
Well, I want to apologize.

12:27.050 --> 12:29.080
Sorry I got distracted.

12:29.120 --> 12:30.480
It's okay.

12:30.520 --> 12:32.020
I'm sorry
your girlfriend hates you.

12:32.050 --> 12:33.490
Ah, she doesn't hate me.

12:33.520 --> 12:35.090
She's just ashamed
of me or something.

12:35.120 --> 12:36.920
Well, you know what?

12:36.960 --> 12:38.930
If she's really ashamed
of you, then...

12:38.960 --> 12:42.260
then she's the stupidest bitch
in the whole wide world.

12:42.300 --> 12:44.200
- Easy. Okay, slow down.
- I apologize if I went overboard.

12:44.230 --> 12:45.670
- Water under the bridge.
- I've never been ashamed.

12:45.700 --> 12:48.170
Wish I could have helped
you get that girl, man.

12:48.200 --> 12:49.570
Feel like I blew it.

12:49.600 --> 12:51.040
Well, she was kind of nutty.

12:51.070 --> 12:52.770
What happened to us, man?

12:52.810 --> 12:54.880
We used to be
the best in the biz.

12:54.910 --> 12:57.040
We still are.

12:57.080 --> 12:59.780
I'm the best wingman
that's ever wung.

12:59.820 --> 13:02.450
- Make a plan?
- Absolutely.

13:06.320 --> 13:07.990
You're my brother.

13:09.930 --> 13:11.360
Thank you.
Charge that to room 304.

13:11.390 --> 13:12.760
Ah!

13:12.790 --> 13:14.630
You! Charge that to nothing.

13:14.660 --> 13:16.060
She's checking out.

13:16.100 --> 13:17.500
Adding this hotel
to your rap sheets?

13:17.530 --> 13:18.770
You found me.

13:18.800 --> 13:20.730
- Oh, yeah.
- Don't you want to know why I left?

13:20.770 --> 13:24.140
You saw my text,
and I'm... I'm honestly sorry,

13:24.170 --> 13:27.580
but... you do ruin everything!

13:27.610 --> 13:30.210
Whoa. Thought I was gonna
turn the tables with that one.

13:30.250 --> 13:31.950
Get your ass in the car.
I'm taking you to the airport.

13:31.980 --> 13:33.480
Thought we could share
some calamari.

13:33.520 --> 13:34.820
- Now!
- Kobe beef sliders?

13:34.850 --> 13:36.280
- Now...!
- Lobster quesadilla?

13:36.320 --> 13:39.090
Right now.

13:47.260 --> 13:49.960
This is a great...

13:50.000 --> 13:52.230
Mmm.

13:53.770 --> 13:55.140
You know, Bertie had a dream

13:55.170 --> 13:56.500
she killed me.

13:57.940 --> 13:59.740
So, uh, Coach, what's new?

13:59.770 --> 14:01.210
Nothing.

14:01.240 --> 14:02.340
Isn't that right, Cece?

14:02.380 --> 14:03.980
Hmm?

14:04.010 --> 14:05.850
What's that supposed to mean?

14:05.880 --> 14:07.180
Oh, you'll figure it out.

14:08.450 --> 14:09.820
If not, just text me.

14:09.850 --> 14:11.150
Or don't. You're good at that.

14:11.190 --> 14:12.350
Oh, my God.

14:12.390 --> 14:14.320
Okay. We made out

14:14.360 --> 14:15.820
once, pointlessly, for two hours.

14:15.860 --> 14:17.320
That's it.

14:17.360 --> 14:18.630
Get over it. Let it go.

14:18.660 --> 14:20.430
Pointless... was it?

14:20.460 --> 14:22.130
- Yeah.
- I mean, who does that?!

14:22.160 --> 14:25.500
Super-hot make out, and then,
you ice me out for two months.

14:25.530 --> 14:28.040
What are you talking about?!
Ice out what?

14:28.070 --> 14:30.640
You text me, "Happy Monday."
What do I do with that?

14:30.670 --> 14:33.110
Oh, I don't know.
Maybe have a happy Monday.

14:33.140 --> 14:34.440
Going out with you

14:34.480 --> 14:35.840
was the hottest

14:35.880 --> 14:37.710
and dumbest mistake I ever made!

14:37.750 --> 14:39.150
It was the hottest, dumbest,

14:39.180 --> 14:42.320
sexiest mistake I ever made.
It was so dumb of me

14:42.350 --> 14:44.450
to pick you up and press
you up against that wall.

14:44.490 --> 14:48.060
So dumb how cool those bricks
made my skin feel.

14:48.090 --> 14:50.460
You guys should try
the fisherman's bisque.

14:50.490 --> 14:52.060
Has just the right amount of tang.

14:52.090 --> 14:54.200
- That tang?
- Mm.

14:54.230 --> 14:56.030
That's tang.

14:56.060 --> 14:58.300
Okay.

14:58.330 --> 15:00.300
- Whoa! Whoa. Okay.
- Sorry. I was trying... I was trying to...

15:00.340 --> 15:01.540
Just gonna pivot a little bit more

15:01.570 --> 15:03.400
- to the side. Yeah.
- Yeah, just pivot?

15:03.440 --> 15:05.070
No, okay, look,
I think the way it was...

15:05.110 --> 15:07.310
...was more...
I was up, right?

15:07.340 --> 15:09.580
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, you were up.
- That's-that's how it was... yeah, up.

15:09.610 --> 15:13.020
- Just... Okay.
- All right. Now what do we do?

15:13.080 --> 15:14.920
Maybe just, like, lower your center
of gravity, and then this is gonna work.

15:14.950 --> 15:19.090
Just lower it down,
I'm gonna clench my thighs.

15:19.120 --> 15:21.590
- I'm gonna fall. I'm gonna fall...
- I'm clenching my thighs as hard as I can.

15:21.620 --> 15:24.190
- Okay, okay.
- What? Oh. Geez.

15:25.530 --> 15:26.490
- Oh!
- Geez.

15:27.530 --> 15:29.800
That was... awful.

15:29.830 --> 15:31.000
- That was the worst.
- Oh, my gosh.

15:31.030 --> 15:33.370
- Wow, what is happening?
- Oh, Lord.

15:33.400 --> 15:35.740
Maybe you were right not to
text me back, 'cause that was...

15:35.770 --> 15:37.540
embarrassing.

15:37.570 --> 15:40.610
- I'm sorry.
- No, that's cool.

15:40.640 --> 15:43.410
Can we just be friends now?
You know?

15:43.450 --> 15:46.850
Yeah. I mean, why not?

15:46.880 --> 15:48.420
Friends?

15:48.450 --> 15:50.780
Friends.

15:50.820 --> 15:52.350
Friends.

15:52.390 --> 15:54.260
Come here, you.

15:54.290 --> 15:55.760
- Oh, oh!
- Aah! Sorry.

15:55.790 --> 15:58.590
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Literally just bit my tooth.

15:58.630 --> 16:02.060
- I'm sorry, when I get excited
my teeth come out. - Who does that?

16:02.100 --> 16:03.860
- Sorry.
- I think I broke my tooth.

16:03.900 --> 16:05.030
Let me see?

16:05.070 --> 16:06.400
Oh.

16:09.370 --> 16:10.740
Okay.

16:10.770 --> 16:13.410
Go straight to the gate.

16:13.440 --> 16:16.240
Look... I get why
you're mad at me.

16:16.280 --> 16:17.910
Okay? But if it's
any consolation,

16:17.950 --> 16:20.580
I'm a woman in my 30s
about to get on a plane

16:20.620 --> 16:22.350
to go live with my mother.

16:22.380 --> 16:24.180
It's only a matter of time

16:24.220 --> 16:26.590
before I have a tiny
denim backpack, too.

16:28.120 --> 16:30.720
I said I would never
go back to Portland.

16:30.760 --> 16:34.330
So I guess I'm a complete failure.

16:35.730 --> 16:37.730
I'm the baby.

16:49.820 --> 16:52.880
Is this the craziest thing that's going on
in the airport? Really?

16:53.400 --> 16:56.140
Okay, recap, you hit
the dance floor, and...

16:56.220 --> 16:57.540
Do what I do best,
be an embarrassment.

16:57.640 --> 17:00.100
Well, it's a gift, Nick.
I need you to ruin this bar mitzvah.

17:00.260 --> 17:02.060
What do you say, just get out there
and do some weird dancing?

17:02.180 --> 17:03.780
- It's got to be bigger than that, man.
- Bigger than that?

17:03.920 --> 17:05.460
Then I come out there and I...

17:05.490 --> 17:06.630
...knock you out.
It's all right.

17:06.660 --> 17:08.130
Again, it'll be a stage punch.

17:08.160 --> 17:10.130
Don't worry.
I've done several productions

17:10.160 --> 17:11.130
...of West Side Story.

17:11.170 --> 17:12.170
I know. You told me.

17:12.200 --> 17:13.800
As a Puerto Rican Shark.
♪ Da, da. ♪

17:13.829 --> 17:14.900
- That's cool.
- It was awesome.

17:14.940 --> 17:16.640
You never came
and saw it, but...

17:16.670 --> 17:18.670
- Well, I was very busy at that time.
- Whatever, never mind.

17:18.710 --> 17:20.260
The rabbi will then come out,
he'll thank me,

17:20.359 --> 17:21.839
- the hero...
- Gotcha.

17:21.880 --> 17:24.010
He'll offer me his daughter's
hand, then, five years from now,

17:24.050 --> 17:27.180
Rachael is pregnant with Elon's
little sister and we're having

17:27.210 --> 17:29.850
a beautiful family New Year's

17:29.880 --> 17:31.920

17:31.950 --> 17:35.080
You've been monologuing,
lately, Schmidt.

17:35.500 --> 17:37.040
Do you s... Do you,
do you hear yourself?

17:37.100 --> 17:38.200

- You... Okay.

17:38.280 --> 17:39.720
I'm not gonna get mad at you, 'cause
I respect you and you're one of...

17:39.780 --> 17:40.920
- I'm unaware of it.
- But, like, it's weird.

17:41.000 --> 17:42.940
- I apologize. I'll stop doing it.
- Okay.

17:43.200 --> 17:44.930
- Hey.
- Yeah?

17:44.970 --> 17:46.870
Light this cannon up
so I can shoot off.

17:49.900 --> 17:52.170
Oh!

17:52.210 --> 17:55.040
Well, well, well,
it's a snake in the grass.

17:55.080 --> 17:57.280
How you doing?
My name's Nick.

17:57.310 --> 17:59.350
You know martial arts?

17:59.380 --> 18:00.950
Swear to God you don't?

18:00.980 --> 18:02.780
You run around
with this hunk anymore,

18:02.820 --> 18:05.120
this little surfer cat.

18:05.150 --> 18:06.650
I know your game.

18:06.690 --> 18:08.790
Charming the ladies
with your baby blue eyes.

18:08.820 --> 18:10.320
I wish I had 'em.

18:12.260 --> 18:13.790
Breaking my heart, beautiful.

18:13.830 --> 18:15.700
What?

18:15.730 --> 18:17.800
And I all do is love you.
I give and I give.

18:17.830 --> 18:21.970
I been working for 40 years
at the steel mill for you.

18:22.060 --> 18:23.080
We just met.

18:23.160 --> 18:25.970
I want to rip that blouse
off you and put it on me.

18:26.010 --> 18:29.880
- Oh, wow.
- I want to wear your lipstick.

18:29.910 --> 18:33.310
- Well, that's interesting.
- I want to rip those earrings off

18:33.350 --> 18:35.980
and put 'em on and
I want to be the girl!

18:36.020 --> 18:38.080
That would be wonderful.

18:38.120 --> 18:42.360
But I won't do it around
all these crazy Jews.

18:42.390 --> 18:44.360
And I don't care who's watching.
I want what I want.

18:45.560 --> 18:46.590
Ooh!

18:52.270 --> 18:54.530
- Unhand her, sir.
- Whoa, what is... Hey, man.

18:54.570 --> 18:56.300
That's my mother!

18:56.340 --> 18:57.400
Ooh!

18:57.440 --> 18:59.040
You okay?

18:59.070 --> 19:00.440
Nice shot, Dr. Nussbaum.

19:00.470 --> 19:03.100
Would you like to date my daughter?
She's available.

19:03.200 --> 19:05.750
Oh, great, yeah, tell the
whole room that I'm available.

19:05.780 --> 19:08.680
I'm not telling the whole room.
I'm telling Dr. Nussbaum.

19:08.720 --> 19:10.980
- A doctor.
- No, I got that.

19:14.880 --> 19:16.120
- Oh, hey.
- Hey.

19:16.160 --> 19:19.460
I like your glass...
What happened to your eye?

19:19.490 --> 19:21.490
I got beat up at a bar mitzvah.

19:21.530 --> 19:22.560
And I know that's
embarrassing, and I know

19:22.600 --> 19:25.130
you're too embarrassed of me
to introduce me to your sister.

19:25.170 --> 19:26.800
- What?
- And I get that, Jess.

19:26.830 --> 19:29.770
- Nick, that's not at all what...
- You know what?

19:29.800 --> 19:31.320
There is something I just
cannot shake,

19:31.420 --> 19:33.040
I been tossing
and turning all night long.

19:33.140 --> 19:35.540
We literally have been apart for like
15 seconds, man. Get out of here.

19:35.580 --> 19:38.040
I am your wingman now, Nick,
because it-it takes two wings...

19:38.080 --> 19:41.050
- Don't do this.
- ...for a, for a bird to dance.

19:41.080 --> 19:43.600
- Jessica Day, you are dating a champion.
- I agree.

19:43.700 --> 19:46.390
And I don't know why on earth
you would be embarrassed of him.

19:46.420 --> 19:48.050
- Don't... I told him not...
- Excuse me?

19:48.090 --> 19:49.590
I don't understand where
this is coming from.

19:49.620 --> 19:51.160
I am not embarrassed of Nick,

19:51.190 --> 19:52.430
- not at all.
- For real?

19:52.460 --> 19:54.090
- No.
- Well, that's great news.

19:54.130 --> 19:55.760
I'm glad that's out of the way.
Fantastic.

19:55.800 --> 19:57.960
I'll see you guys for brunch.

19:58.000 --> 20:00.400
Why would you think that?

20:00.430 --> 20:03.900
- She's embarrassed of me. Oh, hello.
- Oh, hey.

20:03.940 --> 20:04.940
- This is, um...
- I'm Abby.

20:04.970 --> 20:06.910
- Abby.
- Hi.

20:07.000 --> 20:08.100
Mom was right.

20:08.120 --> 20:10.080
- He does have an uptown butt.
- What?

20:10.110 --> 20:13.010
- I'd like to put that butt in ski pants.
- What does that mean?

20:13.050 --> 20:14.410
- Nothing.
- Everything.

20:14.450 --> 20:16.480
- Come on, Abby.
- Oh, come on.

20:16.520 --> 20:17.980
Jess, I'm putting my
stuff in your room.

20:18.020 --> 20:19.120
So that mean you guys

20:19.150 --> 20:21.290
are gonna stay in your room.

20:21.320 --> 20:23.560
- Thank me later.
- All right.

20:25.360 --> 20:28.600
Well, she is just a delight.

20:29.380 --> 20:31.330
So I might have told

20:31.370 --> 20:33.830
a few lies about my sister.

20:33.870 --> 20:35.500
She's a total train wreck,
and she was in jail.

20:35.560 --> 20:38.440
Well, look, why lie? You know
how many Millers have been

20:38.470 --> 20:40.110
or are currently in jail?

20:40.140 --> 20:42.040
I get it. It's just, she's such a...

20:42.080 --> 20:43.740
I can hear you.

20:45.180 --> 20:48.010
- Complicated person.
- Right.

20:48.050 --> 20:49.520
Anyway.

20:49.550 --> 20:50.850
She needs me.

20:50.890 --> 20:51.890
Right.

20:51.920 --> 20:53.190
Can she stay with us?

20:53.220 --> 20:54.890
Yeah, of course.
How-how long?

20:54.920 --> 20:56.020
A few weeks.

20:56.060 --> 20:58.220
- Few weeks.
- A month, tops.

20:58.260 --> 20:59.830
Six months, super tops.

20:59.860 --> 21:02.060
- Six months.
- Just till I get on my feet.

21:02.100 --> 21:03.900
Oh. What's your address?

21:03.930 --> 21:06.170
In case I want to get any "deliveries."

21:06.200 --> 21:08.000
I'm not telling you.

21:08.040 --> 21:09.370
I'm not telling you, I'm n...

21:09.400 --> 21:11.570
"Deliveries?" No.

21:11.610 --> 21:13.870
Deliveries are fine, "deliveries," no.

21:13.910 --> 21:14.910
Depends what you want "delivered."

21:14.940 --> 21:16.940
I'll figure it out.

21:20.450 --> 21:21.680
Well...

21:24.050 --> 21:25.590
I love you.
