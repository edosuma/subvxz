WEBVTT

00:03.537 --> 00:07.341
( playing classical music )

00:14.415 --> 00:17.151
We're running late.
Let's get a move on,
little lady.

00:17.185 --> 00:20.688
There's someone
at the front door, Mom.

00:20.721 --> 00:22.556
( doorbell chimes )

00:23.457 --> 00:24.725
( chuckling ):
Show-off.

00:24.758 --> 00:26.760
Let's go.

00:31.599 --> 00:33.201
Mrs. Watson?
Yes?

00:33.234 --> 00:34.768
There's been an
accident, ma'am.

00:34.802 --> 00:38.539
Your husband--
he's been injured.

00:38.572 --> 00:40.074
I'm to transport you

00:40.108 --> 00:43.244
and your daughter
to the hospital.

00:45.413 --> 00:47.448
Good morning,
Captain Watson.

00:47.481 --> 00:48.549
Good morning, Shirley.

00:48.582 --> 00:51.119
How'd the recital
go last night?

00:51.152 --> 00:53.487
Well, would it be wrong

00:53.521 --> 00:55.156
for me to say
that I'm the father

00:55.189 --> 00:58.559
of the most talented little girl
in the entire world?

00:58.592 --> 01:00.128
It'd be wrong if you didn't.

01:00.161 --> 01:01.462
Still on a diet,
or should I

01:01.495 --> 01:02.796
put cream in your coffee?

01:02.830 --> 01:04.665
I ran ten miles yesterday.

01:04.698 --> 01:06.867
Cream coming right up.

01:06.900 --> 01:09.837
( electronically distorted ):
Captain Watson.
Who's that?

01:09.870 --> 01:12.106
Before Shirley returns
with your coffee,

01:12.140 --> 01:14.275
know that we have
your wife and daughter.

01:16.544 --> 01:18.246
If you want
to see them alive again,

01:18.279 --> 01:20.214
you will do exactly as I say.

01:22.250 --> 01:26.220
Captioning sponsored by
PARAMOUNT TELEVISION

01:26.254 --> 01:30.258
and CBS

02:06.727 --> 02:09.563
( electronically distorted ):
Look in your briefcase's
back compartment.

02:09.597 --> 02:10.931
Who are you?

02:10.964 --> 02:12.666
Now, Captain Watson.

02:13.801 --> 02:17.505
Plug it in and place it on top
of your computer screen.

02:17.538 --> 02:20.608
You will go about your day
in the usual way.

02:20.641 --> 02:22.876
Only you will not
leave your office.

02:22.910 --> 02:25.679
You will make no attempt
to contact anyone.

02:25.713 --> 02:26.880
Who are you?

02:26.914 --> 02:28.349
What do you want?!

02:28.382 --> 02:30.718
$2 million from
the Special Operations fund.

02:30.751 --> 02:31.785
Are you crazy?

02:31.819 --> 02:34.188
I can't transfer $2 million.

02:34.222 --> 02:36.257
The system won't allow me to.

02:36.290 --> 02:37.325
You'll find a way, Captain.

02:37.358 --> 02:41.295
Or would you rather
I shoot them both right now?

02:42.863 --> 02:46.634
Anyone? And I mean anyone know

02:46.667 --> 02:48.902
when the air conditioner's
getting fixed?!

02:48.936 --> 02:51.205
Huh?! What about the
name of the genius

02:51.239 --> 02:53.441
who invented windows
that don't open?

02:53.474 --> 02:54.908
What, are we on a spaceship?

02:54.942 --> 02:57.311
Ooh, have you been working out?

02:57.345 --> 02:59.880
All summer long;
thanks for finally noticing.

02:59.913 --> 03:00.714
No, I mean right now,

03:00.748 --> 03:02.650
'cause you're sweating
like a pig,

03:02.683 --> 03:04.652
and it's not
very attractive.

03:04.685 --> 03:06.454
( yelping )

03:06.487 --> 03:09.357
Uh... morning, Agent Todd.

03:09.390 --> 03:10.624
McGee...
Yeah?

03:10.658 --> 03:12.660
you have two seconds to tell me
what you're doing down there.

03:12.693 --> 03:16.597
I'm upgrading
the computer network, and, uh...

03:16.630 --> 03:18.899
Time's up.
No, I wasn't looking, I swear.

03:18.932 --> 03:23.671
Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow! Ow.
Ow. Ah. Ah. Ow...

03:23.704 --> 03:26.807
I wasn't looking. Ow.

03:26.840 --> 03:29.243
Tony.
Yes, sir?

03:29.277 --> 03:30.978
Did I just see
what I thought I saw?

03:31.011 --> 03:33.381
Out of respect
for my co-workers, boss,

03:33.414 --> 03:36.850
I'd have to say yes, you did,
and, uh, it's very disturbing.

03:36.884 --> 03:38.252
I agree.
Put your damn shirt back on.

03:38.286 --> 03:40.854
This is a federal
office building,

03:40.888 --> 03:41.955
not a gym.

03:41.989 --> 03:43.724
Damn, McGee,

03:43.757 --> 03:44.858
why are you still here?

03:44.892 --> 03:46.894
Uh, well, the
contractors, they
won't wire the network

03:46.927 --> 03:48.962
until the air
conditioning's fixed.

03:48.996 --> 03:50.831
I-It's a union thing,
so...

03:50.864 --> 03:52.700
So, you decided
it's more important

03:52.733 --> 03:55.836
for an NCIS Special Agent
to crawl around all day

03:55.869 --> 03:57.538
by yourself?

03:57.571 --> 03:58.806
Man asked you
a question.

03:58.839 --> 04:01.775
Well, no, I-I w-wanted it fixed
before I returned to Norfolk.

04:01.809 --> 04:02.910
Yeah?

04:02.943 --> 04:05.579
You have any idea
where thinking like this

04:05.613 --> 04:06.714
is going to lead you?

04:06.747 --> 04:07.881
Yeah, do you, McGee?

04:08.716 --> 04:10.951
Promotion.

04:10.984 --> 04:13.587
You need any help,
you ask Tony here.

04:13.621 --> 04:15.889
Looks like he could
use a workout.

04:15.923 --> 04:18.892
Uh, i-it's not
that difficult.

04:18.926 --> 04:21.362
Uh, so, I guess I
could do it myself.

04:21.395 --> 04:23.063
Good answer.

04:23.096 --> 04:25.533
Don't let him intimidate you,
McGee.

04:25.566 --> 04:27.401
That's my job today.

04:27.435 --> 04:28.536
( phone ringing )

04:28.569 --> 04:29.803
Agent Todd.

04:29.837 --> 04:31.572
I didn't look.
Oh, no, I believe you.

04:31.605 --> 04:33.907
I just have a little question
that I want to ask you.

04:33.941 --> 04:35.576
Is she a pantyhose
or a thong girl?

04:35.609 --> 04:36.877
'Cause I'm thinking thong.

04:36.910 --> 04:38.546
( grunts )

04:38.579 --> 04:40.648
We've got a problem, Gibbs.

04:41.815 --> 04:43.917
Damn it, I hate this thing.

04:43.951 --> 04:45.753
Crap!

04:45.786 --> 04:47.855
There's a secretary
from the Pentagon downstairs.

04:47.888 --> 04:49.990
She claims that her boss
is being held hostage...

04:50.023 --> 04:51.091
by his computer.

04:51.124 --> 04:54.762
See? There's a reason
I didn't trust these things.

04:54.795 --> 04:58.466
Here-- reboot that
or something.

04:58.499 --> 04:59.700
Send her up.

05:01.802 --> 05:03.036
Reboot it?

05:03.070 --> 05:05.038
Or you can do
what we always do.

05:05.072 --> 05:06.974
It's his third one
this month.

05:13.581 --> 05:15.883
When I brought him his coffee,
I heard the computer

05:15.916 --> 05:17.485
talking to him.

05:17.518 --> 05:18.752
"You've got mail"?

05:18.786 --> 05:20.654
No, it was
this weird

05:20.688 --> 05:22.490
electronic voice,
and then it cut off

05:22.523 --> 05:23.857
the second I entered the room.

05:25.092 --> 05:26.727
Look, I know
it sounds crazy,

05:26.760 --> 05:28.962
but I can't tell you the rest
until you promise

05:28.996 --> 05:30.931
that you won't try
to contact him.

05:30.964 --> 05:35.436
Whatever you're afraid of,
Miss Wilkes, we can handle it.

05:37.405 --> 05:39.907
He slipped this
in a stack of folders

05:39.940 --> 05:44.578
and told me to take
the rest of the day off.

05:44.612 --> 05:47.014
TONY:
Forget
your glasses, boss?

05:48.982 --> 05:50.684
"Office under
electronic surveillance.

05:50.718 --> 05:51.785
"Can't leave.

05:51.819 --> 05:52.720
"Jill and Sandy kidnapped.

05:52.753 --> 05:54.688
"Must transfer two mill
to overseas account

05:54.722 --> 05:57.024
"by 1800, or they die.

05:57.057 --> 05:58.959
"Contact NCIS.

05:58.992 --> 06:01.429
No one else."

06:01.462 --> 06:03.997
Finally someone
who appreciates us.

06:04.031 --> 06:06.934
If anything
should happen to them...

06:06.967 --> 06:08.836
I mean,
she's just a little girl,

06:08.869 --> 06:10.471
Agent Gibbs.

06:14.542 --> 06:17.911
The Watsons live in McLean.

06:17.945 --> 06:19.947
There's no answer at home,
and their daughter Sandy

06:19.980 --> 06:21.482
didn't show up to school
this morning.

06:21.515 --> 06:22.883
It says here she's blind.

06:22.916 --> 06:25.953
I can confirm
he's the comptroller for JSOC.

06:25.986 --> 06:27.621
Office is in the A-ring
at the Pentagon.

06:27.655 --> 06:29.022
I'm pulling up
the schematic now.

06:29.056 --> 06:30.991
KATE:
"JSOC"?

06:31.024 --> 06:32.660
Joint Special
Operations Command.

06:32.693 --> 06:33.727
They fund SMU-- stands for...

06:33.761 --> 06:34.895
Special Military Units.

06:34.928 --> 06:37.598
I worked with a few of them
when I was Secret Service.

06:37.631 --> 06:40.434
So, he could really transfer
this kind of money overseas?

06:40.468 --> 06:41.334
More, if he needs to.

06:41.368 --> 06:43.070
Our bad guy
would have to pass through

06:43.103 --> 06:45.606
five security checkpoints
to get to Watson's office.

06:45.639 --> 06:47.541
Well, the Pentagon
records all access.

06:47.575 --> 06:49.176
There's 25,000 people
working there, Kate.

06:49.209 --> 06:51.078
By the time we're done
downloading that list,

06:51.111 --> 06:52.145
government's out $2 million.

06:52.179 --> 06:53.881
Or Watson's family's dead.

06:53.914 --> 06:55.583
Well, it has to be somebody
on the inside.

06:55.616 --> 06:57.951
The Pentagon is the most secure
building in the world.

06:57.985 --> 06:59.687
They could be using a Trojan.

07:01.088 --> 07:02.790
She said that they were using
his computer.

07:02.823 --> 07:04.958
A Trojan would give them
back door access.

07:04.992 --> 07:06.460
Kiss your mother
with that mouth, McGee?

07:06.494 --> 07:08.696
No, Tony, a Trojan's a program.

07:08.729 --> 07:09.963
It's like a virus.

07:09.997 --> 07:11.632
It establishes a gateway
to a computer

07:11.665 --> 07:13.200
and allows a hacker
to control the system.

07:13.233 --> 07:14.201
Still doesn't explain

07:14.234 --> 07:16.737
how it got
into his machine.

07:16.770 --> 07:18.171
Well, if they're good,
they could have done
it from anywhere.

07:18.205 --> 07:19.239
Wouldn't even have to set foot
not in the building.

07:19.272 --> 07:21.074
How are they watching him, then?

07:21.108 --> 07:22.610
Could be using a webcam.

07:22.643 --> 07:24.612
Or they're lying.

07:24.645 --> 07:26.079
Kate, take McGee and search

07:26.113 --> 07:27.114
the Watsons' house.

07:27.147 --> 07:29.049
DiNozzo,
I want everything there is

07:29.082 --> 07:31.619
on Watson and his family
by the time I get back.

07:31.652 --> 07:32.920
Where you going, boss?

07:32.953 --> 07:34.655
To talk
to Captain Watson.

07:34.688 --> 07:35.889
Wait, Gibbs,

07:35.923 --> 07:37.891
if they are watching
him and you show up...

07:37.925 --> 07:40.127
I'd better make sure
they don't notice me.

07:40.160 --> 07:42.062
That is not a good call.

07:42.095 --> 07:43.931
Relax. You think Gibbs
keeps that haircut

07:43.964 --> 07:45.065
to save on shampoo?

07:46.299 --> 07:48.569
MARINE STAFF SERGEANT:
Morning, Gunny.

07:48.602 --> 07:49.970
Morning, Staff Sergeant.

07:50.003 --> 07:51.204
DISTORTED VOICE:
Moving those dollars

07:51.238 --> 07:53.006
around, Captain?

07:53.040 --> 07:54.141
I'm trying.

07:54.174 --> 07:56.009
The only way
I can stay under the radar

07:56.043 --> 07:59.079
is to not make a withdrawal
that exceeds $10,000

07:59.112 --> 08:00.280
from any single
operational budget.

08:00.313 --> 08:01.715
( knock at door )

08:01.749 --> 08:03.717
What's that?
Well, this is an office.

08:03.751 --> 08:06.053
People are gonna be dropping by
request forms all day long.

08:06.086 --> 08:08.255
Not today.
Send them away.

08:08.288 --> 08:10.290
I keep doing that,
they're gonna get suspicious.

08:10.323 --> 08:14.261
Okay, but just don't forget
what's at stake here, Captain.

08:14.294 --> 08:16.830
I won't.

08:16.864 --> 08:18.231
( whispers ):
Bastard.

08:18.265 --> 08:19.366
Enter.

08:19.399 --> 08:21.869
Sorry to have missed the budget
meeting yesterday, sir,

08:21.902 --> 08:23.270
but you know
how the colonel gets

08:23.303 --> 08:24.572
when he's sick.

08:24.605 --> 08:25.839
How's he doing, Gunny?

08:25.873 --> 08:26.874
Better, sir, thank you.

08:26.907 --> 08:27.808
Wanted me to check with you.

08:27.841 --> 08:29.577
See if you need any extra help
down here.

08:29.610 --> 08:30.711
Tell him I appreciate it,

08:30.744 --> 08:31.244
but we got
things covered.

08:31.278 --> 08:32.880
Roger that, sir.

08:32.913 --> 08:34.748
Latest batch of requests
for you.

08:34.782 --> 08:37.084
Most immediate priorities
on top.

08:39.119 --> 08:43.023
This must be that daughter
you're always talking about.

08:43.056 --> 08:45.192
She is a beauty, sir.

08:45.225 --> 08:46.794
She is that, Gunny.

08:46.827 --> 08:47.961
She is that.

08:47.995 --> 08:50.664
You change your mind, sir,
all you have to do is call.

08:50.698 --> 08:53.701
I have plenty of people
willing to help you, sir.

08:53.734 --> 08:55.102
I will, Gunny, thank you.

08:55.135 --> 08:56.837
You have a
nice day, sir.

08:59.306 --> 09:01.775
He's gone.

09:01.809 --> 09:03.611
He is right about one thing.

09:03.644 --> 09:06.580
She is a little beauty.

09:06.614 --> 09:08.048
( whimpering )

09:08.081 --> 09:10.017
Who... who's there?

09:10.050 --> 09:13.754
MAN:
Shh.

09:13.787 --> 09:15.255
( shrieks )

09:23.797 --> 09:26.366
No signs of anyone
observing the place.

09:26.399 --> 09:28.602
Let's roll.

09:35.876 --> 09:38.612
She either left in a hurry,

09:38.646 --> 09:40.848
or was forced to.

09:40.881 --> 09:43.083
What makes you think
she just didn't leave it there?

09:43.116 --> 09:44.818
Because she's a little girl,
McGee.

09:44.852 --> 09:46.353
They're not typically slobs.

09:46.386 --> 09:49.389
Remind me to introduce you
to my little sister.

09:49.422 --> 09:52.325
What was that?
Nothing, Agent Todd.

09:53.861 --> 09:55.863
( doorbell ringing )

09:57.665 --> 09:58.799
You still pushing

09:58.832 --> 10:00.233
to be a full-time Field Agent?

10:00.267 --> 10:01.669
Very much so.

10:01.702 --> 10:02.970
Well, we need
to get in.

10:03.003 --> 10:05.372
Suggestions?

10:05.405 --> 10:07.641
Uh, last time I encountered
a situation like this,

10:07.675 --> 10:08.876
Tony threw a rock
through the window.

10:08.909 --> 10:12.145
Yet another glaring
difference between
boys and girls.

10:12.179 --> 10:13.714
Follow me.

10:16.283 --> 10:18.218
DISTORTED VOICE:
He was right about one thing.

10:18.251 --> 10:20.087
She is a little beauty.

10:20.120 --> 10:22.055
Okay, Gibbs, your mike is
coming in loud and clear,

10:22.089 --> 10:23.691
Who's that in the
office with him,

10:23.724 --> 10:24.758
the devil?!

10:24.792 --> 10:27.094
Hey, hey, hey.
You don't need to yell.

10:28.696 --> 10:30.698
You know, considering no one
in this room is actually deaf,

10:30.731 --> 10:31.331
that's really annoying.

10:32.365 --> 10:34.668
Hey, that was about me,
wasn't it.

10:34.702 --> 10:37.004
Patch in the video, Abs.

10:39.039 --> 10:41.909
That's not a very
flattering angle.

10:41.942 --> 10:43.677
Yeah, well, it's
the best I could do.

10:43.711 --> 10:45.679
What can you tell me
about the voice?

10:45.713 --> 10:47.948
It sounds like this particle
physicist I used to date.

10:47.981 --> 10:50.317
He had these tiny little
Chiclet-like teeth

10:50.350 --> 10:51.952
and an Eiffel tower tattoo...

10:51.985 --> 10:52.786
You want this Abby,

10:52.820 --> 10:54.287
or not?
Okay,

10:54.321 --> 10:56.123
obviously, it's being disguised.

10:56.156 --> 10:59.326
I think I can filter it back
to its original state.

10:59.359 --> 11:01.729
VOICE ( high-pitched ):
She is a little beauty.

11:01.762 --> 11:03.831
She is a little beauty.

11:03.864 --> 11:06.166
Yeah, okay, I'll get
that uh, APB out

11:06.199 --> 11:08.001
on the Lollipop
Guild right away.

11:08.035 --> 11:08.869
Patience, Tony.

11:11.038 --> 11:14.241
VOICE ( slow, gravelly ):
...little beauty.

11:14.274 --> 11:16.209
...a little beauty.

11:17.310 --> 11:19.212
MAN:
He was right about one thing.

11:19.246 --> 11:20.881
Shea little beauty.

11:20.914 --> 11:22.082
Pretty cool, huh?

11:22.115 --> 11:23.316
Not bad.
Thank you.

11:23.350 --> 11:24.885
The next thing
I want you to do

11:24.918 --> 11:26.720
is hack into Watson's computer.

11:26.754 --> 11:28.088
It's the only link
we have to the kidnapper.

11:28.121 --> 11:31.224
Gibbs, we are talking
about the Pentagon here.

11:31.258 --> 11:34.227
Even their encryptions
have encryptions.

11:34.261 --> 11:37.264
Yeah? That dirtbag
sure managed it.

11:37.297 --> 11:39.099
It probably
took him months.

11:39.132 --> 11:41.034
Our best bet is
to ask the DOD

11:41.068 --> 11:42.469
for access to their system.

11:42.502 --> 11:45.005
First thing they'll do
is disconnect the connection.

11:45.038 --> 11:46.774
That happens,

11:46.807 --> 11:48.075
we'll end up
with two dead dependents.

11:49.843 --> 11:51.845
I don't know if I can do it.

11:51.879 --> 11:54.281
DiNozzo, get McGee
on the hook.

11:54.314 --> 11:56.149
No.

11:57.017 --> 11:58.451
I'll get in.

11:58.485 --> 11:59.753
Yeah?

11:59.787 --> 12:01.088
Yeah.

12:01.121 --> 12:03.156
I believe you.

12:05.793 --> 12:08.095
Relax. When's the last
time Gibbs was wrong?

12:08.128 --> 12:11.731
Discounting the whole
marriage thing, of course.

12:15.002 --> 12:16.904
Okay... McGee,
hold me steady.

12:16.937 --> 12:17.938
( grunting ):
All right.

12:17.971 --> 12:19.106
Okay, more left.

12:20.040 --> 12:22.009
No, no, my left,
your right!

12:22.042 --> 12:23.877
Oh, sorry.

12:23.911 --> 12:25.412
McGee, what're you doing?

12:25.445 --> 12:27.080
I'm doing what
you're telling me to do.

12:27.114 --> 12:28.481
Are your eyes closed?!

12:28.515 --> 12:29.983
Yes!
Well, then open them

12:30.017 --> 12:31.084
before you kill us!

12:31.118 --> 12:32.252
But this morning, you...

12:32.285 --> 12:34.221
McGee, can't you tell when
somebody's kidding with you?

12:34.254 --> 12:35.889
I used to,
and then I met you guys.

12:35.923 --> 12:36.890
If you want to
work with Gibbs,

12:36.924 --> 12:39.226
then you're going
to have to get over that.

12:39.259 --> 12:41.361
Trust me, I know.

12:41.394 --> 12:43.864
Eyes open, it is.

12:43.897 --> 12:45.365
( groans )

12:51.604 --> 12:52.572
DiNozzo.

12:52.605 --> 12:55.075
I need a way to communicate
with Captain Watson.

12:55.108 --> 12:57.510
Communication part's solved,
boss: Earwig radio receiver.

12:57.544 --> 12:59.880
Used 'em all the time
for undercover work
back in Baltimore.

12:59.913 --> 13:02.215
How do we get it in his ear?

13:02.249 --> 13:05.118
Did I also mention there's
one tiny flaw in my plan?

13:05.152 --> 13:08.288
DiNozzo, I show back up there
as a gunny,

13:08.321 --> 13:09.923
this guy's gonna get suspicious.

13:09.957 --> 13:12.092
Well, you think I could
pass for a Marine?

13:12.125 --> 13:12.960
I don't know.

13:12.993 --> 13:15.128
Let's shave your head
and find out.

13:15.162 --> 13:16.229
( chuckling )

13:16.263 --> 13:18.398
Actually, I was
leaning more towards

13:18.431 --> 13:19.332
the Merchant Marine
kind of thing.

13:19.366 --> 13:21.001
I've got a better idea.
Don't eat that.

13:21.034 --> 13:22.269
No, no, no, no.

13:30.443 --> 13:32.179
No signs of forced entry
or a struggle.

13:32.212 --> 13:33.981
They could have been
taken at gunpoint.

13:34.014 --> 13:35.615
It's possible,
but I don't think so.

13:35.648 --> 13:37.150
Why is that?

13:37.184 --> 13:39.352
Well, why go
to the trouble

13:39.386 --> 13:41.221
of locking the front door
behind you?

13:41.254 --> 13:43.190
Not bad, McGee.

13:43.223 --> 13:45.225
Tony hasn't completely
ruined you yet.

13:47.294 --> 13:49.562
Their daughter
must be quite the pianist.

13:49.596 --> 13:51.231
Beautiful, too.

13:52.132 --> 13:53.934
There's nothing here.

13:53.967 --> 13:56.203
We're wasting our time.

13:56.236 --> 13:57.070
Let's go.

14:02.209 --> 14:04.544
Ah-ah! I use the door.

14:04.577 --> 14:07.247
You lock it
and go back out the window.

14:07.280 --> 14:09.282
I get it.
You're kidding, right?

14:11.284 --> 14:13.320
( door shuts )

14:17.958 --> 14:19.259
Whoa-ho...!

14:19.292 --> 14:20.493
( branches crack )
( groans )

14:20.527 --> 14:23.430
DISTORTED VOICE:
Five hours left, Captain.
Ring the tote.

14:25.032 --> 14:28.301
I've managed to isolate
about 900,000.

14:28.335 --> 14:30.203
I'd move faster if I was you.

14:30.237 --> 14:31.071
( knocking )

14:32.139 --> 14:33.306
You're learning.

14:33.340 --> 14:34.374
You may answer.

14:34.407 --> 14:35.408
Enter.

14:36.343 --> 14:37.945
Hey, Cap'n.

14:38.611 --> 14:41.915
Got your sweet and sour
with extra pineapple.

14:41.949 --> 14:43.150
Might want to change
your order tomorrow.

14:43.183 --> 14:44.551
Heard we're getting in
some fresh duck.

14:44.584 --> 14:47.154
I'll just stick with the usual.

14:47.187 --> 14:48.255
All right.

14:48.288 --> 14:50.523
$8.75 today.

14:50.557 --> 14:52.192
How's the family doing?

14:52.225 --> 14:53.626
Fine, and you?

14:53.660 --> 14:55.662
Still having trouble
communicating
with the girlfriend.

14:55.695 --> 14:58.431
I talk, she doesn't listen.

14:59.599 --> 15:00.667
What are you gonna do?

15:03.236 --> 15:04.604
( clears throat )

15:04.637 --> 15:08.508
Oh, yeah, sure.
For you.

15:08.541 --> 15:09.609
Thanks, Captain.

15:09.642 --> 15:10.944
See ya tomorrow.

15:16.516 --> 15:20.153
Freeze!

15:20.187 --> 15:22.189
Open your lunch.

15:22.222 --> 15:24.724
Show it to the camera.

15:24.757 --> 15:25.692
Now!

15:31.264 --> 15:34.134
( laughing ):
Enjoy.

15:38.271 --> 15:39.639
Delivery complete.

15:39.672 --> 15:40.740
That's good work, Tony.

15:40.773 --> 15:42.342
Thanks, boss. That means a lot.

15:42.375 --> 15:44.411
NCIS doesn't work out,

15:44.444 --> 15:46.679
I hear General Wei's
Chinese Restaurant is hiring.

15:49.782 --> 15:51.118
Abs.

15:51.151 --> 15:53.220
Get the captain
up on the feed.

15:53.253 --> 15:54.254
All right.

15:54.287 --> 15:55.088
You're in.

15:55.122 --> 15:58.091
This is Special Agent Gibbs,
NCIS.

15:58.125 --> 16:01.061
If you can hear me,
cough once, Captain.

16:01.094 --> 16:02.229
( coughs )

16:02.262 --> 16:04.231
We are changing
the game plan, Skipper.

16:04.264 --> 16:06.466
When he contacts you again,

16:06.499 --> 16:08.735
tell him you want a good faith
gesture on his part.

16:08.768 --> 16:12.772
Tell him that you want
your daughter returned now.

16:12.805 --> 16:14.674
Tell him if you
don't get her back,

16:14.707 --> 16:16.776
you're going to take
your chance with the FBI.

16:16.809 --> 16:19.379
He'll try to intimidate you,

16:19.412 --> 16:21.481
but we have to call his bluff.

16:21.514 --> 16:25.185
Rub your brow if you have
the courage to go this route.

16:28.421 --> 16:29.722
You are not alone, Captain.

16:29.756 --> 16:31.324
We're going to get
through this together.

16:32.825 --> 16:35.128
I will be in touch.

16:36.329 --> 16:39.299
Okay, I want these feeds
hard-wired into MTAC.

16:41.234 --> 16:42.302
Done.

16:42.335 --> 16:43.570
We inside his computer yet?

16:43.603 --> 16:45.472
Oh, um...

16:47.207 --> 16:49.142
I, I think um...
Need help?

16:49.176 --> 16:51.378
( sighs ):
Yeah.

16:51.411 --> 16:52.779
All you had
to do was ask.

16:53.713 --> 16:56.316
One of the smartest people
I know told me that once.

16:56.349 --> 16:57.650
Who?

16:57.684 --> 16:58.418
You.

17:02.155 --> 17:04.491
KATE:
The car was still
in the driveway.

17:04.524 --> 17:05.492
No signs of a struggle inside.

17:05.525 --> 17:07.594
I think they may have
known their kidnapper.

17:07.627 --> 17:08.861
Or been duped.

17:08.895 --> 17:10.763
Well, looks like you and Tony
have been making some progress.

17:10.797 --> 17:12.465
Not enough.

17:12.499 --> 17:13.800
DISTORTED VOICE:
Time for an update, Captain.

17:13.833 --> 17:15.835
WATSON:
I'm doing my best.

17:15.868 --> 17:17.104
Just make your deadline.

17:18.338 --> 17:20.607
McGee, help Abby get into
Watson's computer.

17:20.640 --> 17:22.309
Hey, come on, let's go.

17:22.342 --> 17:25.812
A little short
on deodorant today, Tony?

17:25.845 --> 17:27.180
( wry laugh )

17:28.881 --> 17:31.218
WATSON:
I've isolated nearly
1.3 million,

17:31.251 --> 17:33.153
now I want a gesture
of good faith from you.

17:33.186 --> 17:35.722
What kind of gesture, Captain?

17:35.755 --> 17:39.526
I want you to release
my daughter-- immediately.

17:39.559 --> 17:41.094
Not gonna happen.

17:41.128 --> 17:43.363
Why, because they're
already dead?!

17:43.396 --> 17:46.833
How do I know
that's not just a tape?

17:46.866 --> 17:47.800
You listen to me.

17:47.834 --> 17:51.438
You let Sandy go, right now,
or it's over.

17:51.471 --> 17:52.739
I'm going to the FBI.

17:52.772 --> 17:54.674
You'd never forgive yourself,
you know.

17:54.707 --> 17:56.576
GIBBS ( over earpiece ):
This is the hard part, Captain.

17:56.609 --> 17:58.178
Don't back down.

17:58.211 --> 18:00.247
Tell him you want
to talk to your daughter.

18:00.280 --> 18:01.781
I want to speak to her.

18:01.814 --> 18:03.416
Right now!

18:04.651 --> 18:05.718
Plays the piano.

18:05.752 --> 18:07.354
Gifted, I hear.

18:07.387 --> 18:08.688
You don't need eyes
to play the piano,

18:08.721 --> 18:09.756
but you sure
as hell need ears.

18:09.789 --> 18:10.490
( screams )

18:10.523 --> 18:11.524
Sandy!

18:11.558 --> 18:14.261
One little tap. Monaural.

18:14.294 --> 18:17.464
Then the other ear-- pow.

18:17.497 --> 18:21.168
Total silence
and darkness forever.

18:22.302 --> 18:23.736
We can't risk that.

18:23.770 --> 18:24.871
He's bluffing.

18:24.904 --> 18:26.506
Stand your ground.

18:26.539 --> 18:27.874
Tell him if he does that,

18:27.907 --> 18:29.809
he'll never see a penny.

18:29.842 --> 18:31.844
Gibbs!

18:31.878 --> 18:33.646
Let her go unharmed,

18:33.680 --> 18:36.115
or I swear, you'll
never see a dime.

18:37.784 --> 18:44.191
You know, I never was any good
at taking orders, Captain.

18:54.234 --> 18:55.435
( whispering ):
I screwed up.

18:55.468 --> 18:58.205
I screwed it all up.

18:58.238 --> 19:00.473
It's only
been 40 minutes, Captain.

19:00.507 --> 19:03.243
He will contact you soon.

19:03.276 --> 19:04.744
Until then,

19:04.777 --> 19:06.546
you have to stay strong.

19:07.947 --> 19:10.717
It's our best chance
of getting your family back.

19:13.520 --> 19:15.622
You got something to say?

19:15.655 --> 19:17.457
We're taking a really
big risk here, Gibbs.

19:17.490 --> 19:18.858
Yeah, Kate?

19:18.891 --> 19:22.229
What happens to the
little girl and her mother,

19:22.262 --> 19:23.396
once this dirtbag
gets the money?

19:23.430 --> 19:24.764
What, you think
he'll kill them?

19:24.797 --> 19:28.368
You're the profiler,
you tell me.

19:28.401 --> 19:29.336
( phone ringing )

19:29.369 --> 19:31.838
DISTORTED VOICE:
Answer your phone, Captain.

19:31.871 --> 19:33.806
Where is she?

19:33.840 --> 19:35.375
Where's my daughter?!

19:35.408 --> 19:40.813
I said answer
the phone, Captain.

19:44.351 --> 19:45.418
Yes?

19:45.452 --> 19:46.419
SANDY:
Daddy?!

19:46.453 --> 19:47.454
Sandy.

19:47.487 --> 19:48.488
Sweetheart.

19:48.521 --> 19:49.989
Where are you?!

19:50.022 --> 19:50.890
SANDY:
I don't know.

19:50.923 --> 19:53.360
He let me go, but
he said, he said...

19:53.393 --> 19:56.529
he'll kill Mom if I tell
anyone what happened.

19:56.563 --> 19:58.298
Tell me where she is.

19:58.331 --> 19:59.499
DISTORTED VOICE:
Lorton Amtrak station.

19:59.532 --> 20:01.768
You got your
good faith gesture,

20:01.801 --> 20:02.569
now get back to work.

20:02.602 --> 20:03.970
My people are on the way,
Captain.

20:04.003 --> 20:05.872
Tell her to stay where she is.
Go get her.

20:05.905 --> 20:07.640
WATSON:
Sandy, sweetheart,

20:07.674 --> 20:08.875
just stay right there.

20:08.908 --> 20:10.710
( voice breaking ):
Don't... Don't go anywhere.

20:10.743 --> 20:12.712
And Daddy...

20:12.745 --> 20:15.415
Daddy will be there to get
you in just a little while.

20:16.283 --> 20:18.751
Hang up the phone,
now, Captain.

20:18.785 --> 20:20.953
And believe me when I say,

20:20.987 --> 20:24.457
your wife's life
depends on it.

20:24.491 --> 20:27.594
I have to hang up now, baby.

20:27.627 --> 20:30.530
Listen, I want you
to be brave for me, okay?

20:30.563 --> 20:32.732
This will be over
before you know it.

20:32.765 --> 20:34.934
Daddy! Help me, Da...

20:37.304 --> 20:38.338
( crying ):
God, forgive me.

20:38.371 --> 20:39.672
Daddy?

20:39.706 --> 20:40.673
( sniffles )

20:40.707 --> 20:42.875
Daddy?!

20:42.909 --> 20:44.777
( sobbing )

20:44.811 --> 20:46.913
MAN ( over P.A. ):
Baggage handler
to vehicle check-in.

20:46.946 --> 20:48.548
Any available
baggage handler...

20:48.581 --> 20:51.351
( horn blaring )

20:57.390 --> 20:59.859
( beeping )

21:11.871 --> 21:14.006
Face it, McGee--

21:14.040 --> 21:16.042
we are doomed.

21:16.075 --> 21:17.544
( sighs )

21:17.577 --> 21:19.679
Okay, we can try
random password gener...
Did it.

21:19.712 --> 21:21.681
How about
an open port scan...?
I've done it.

21:21.714 --> 21:24.851
Oh, there's an undocumented hole
in the latest I...
Tried it.

21:24.884 --> 21:25.918
Gibbs can't
honestly expect us

21:25.952 --> 21:28.321
to hack into the Pentagon
in a single afternoon.

21:28.355 --> 21:29.088
Yeah.

21:29.121 --> 21:30.790
Oh, you're right,
we are doomed.

21:30.823 --> 21:32.792
( both sigh )

21:32.825 --> 21:34.461
We have to call DOD

21:34.494 --> 21:35.662
and hope they'll
let us in

21:35.695 --> 21:37.664
without severing
the connection.

21:37.697 --> 21:39.699
Unless...

21:39.732 --> 21:42.569
What if the Trojan
isn't system-wide?

21:42.602 --> 21:43.936
If it was,
our bad guy...

21:43.970 --> 21:45.638
...could just steal
the money himself.

21:45.672 --> 21:47.039
He wouldn't need...

21:47.073 --> 21:48.174
...Watson to do it for him.

21:48.207 --> 21:50.943
That means that he can't access
the rest of the network.

21:50.977 --> 21:52.945
We've been trying to
hack the wrong place.

21:52.979 --> 21:54.447
Yeah.

21:54.481 --> 21:55.415
All right.

21:55.448 --> 21:57.450
Scanning for open UDP
and TCP

21:57.484 --> 22:00.420
connections on the JSOC VPN.

22:00.453 --> 22:01.788
( beeping )
Yes, yes.

22:01.821 --> 22:04.056
We got multiple
incoming packets--

22:04.090 --> 22:06.092
ports 139 and 445.

22:06.125 --> 22:08.495
Looks like a variant
of the Doomsday Trojan.

22:10.563 --> 22:11.398
I love it when you

22:11.431 --> 22:12.499
talk Geek.
I love it

22:12.532 --> 22:13.500
that you love it.

22:13.533 --> 22:14.667
GIBBS:
I'll make sure

22:14.701 --> 22:15.968
to mention that
to Captain Watson.

22:16.002 --> 22:18.538
Right after we're done
burying his family.

22:18.571 --> 22:20.640
I would hold off on those
funeral arrangements, Gibbs.

22:20.673 --> 22:21.974
The reason we're so excited...

22:22.008 --> 22:23.810
...is we just hacked
Captain Watson's computer...

22:23.843 --> 22:25.478
...and we should be able to
back-trace the connection...

22:25.512 --> 22:27.079
( electronic crackling )
No!

22:27.113 --> 22:28.515
( beeping, static )
No, no...

22:28.548 --> 22:29.516
no...

22:29.549 --> 22:31.050
No! No!

22:31.083 --> 22:31.884
( screams )

22:31.918 --> 22:33.553
( crackling, beeping stops )

22:33.586 --> 22:35.354
My baby
just French-fried.

22:36.556 --> 22:37.056
System's overheated.

22:37.089 --> 22:38.425
So, reboot it.

22:38.458 --> 22:40.693
Believe it
or not, Gibbs,

22:40.727 --> 22:43.430
not all computer problems
can be solved by rebooting.

22:43.463 --> 22:46.132
Works for me.

22:46.165 --> 22:49.536
Even if it does, it's gonna
take at least an hour for
mine to cool down.

22:49.569 --> 22:51.438
And without
air conditioning,
it'll happen again.

22:51.471 --> 22:52.939
So take it someplace cooler.

22:52.972 --> 22:53.740
Where?

22:53.773 --> 22:54.807
This whole building is

22:54.841 --> 22:56.008
like a illegal sweatshop.

22:56.042 --> 22:58.545
Not the whole building, Abs.

22:58.578 --> 22:59.779
DUCKY:
May I trouble you

22:59.812 --> 23:01.581
for the left
ear, Mr. Palmer?

23:01.614 --> 23:04.484
Uh, one left ear
coming right up.

23:05.452 --> 23:08.721
When is the DNA
analysis coming back

23:08.755 --> 23:10.156
on the right
toe grouping?

23:10.189 --> 23:13.159
Oh, should be ten,
12, uh... days.

23:13.192 --> 23:15.428
Oh, that's interesting.

23:15.462 --> 23:16.629
What's that, Doctor?

23:21.067 --> 23:22.469
Oh, dear.

23:22.502 --> 23:23.503
It's not the
left ear?

23:23.536 --> 23:24.971
It's the left...

23:25.004 --> 23:26.506
It's just not
the right left...

23:26.539 --> 23:27.674
( laughs )

23:27.707 --> 23:28.775
...so to speak.

23:28.808 --> 23:30.109
Well, that would mean
that, uh...

23:30.142 --> 23:31.511
Three bodies.

23:31.544 --> 23:32.712
Time to start
another table.

23:34.681 --> 23:36.516
Hey, Ducky,
my computer died.

23:36.549 --> 23:37.484
We need someplace

23:37.517 --> 23:38.785
cooler to set up shop.

23:38.818 --> 23:40.019
Yeah, well, we're
a bit tight

23:40.052 --> 23:41.020
on space at
the moment,

23:41.053 --> 23:42.989
but, uh, you could use

23:43.022 --> 23:44.724
107...

23:49.496 --> 23:50.463
( gasps )

23:50.497 --> 23:51.363
DUCKY:
Definitely not 107.

23:52.999 --> 23:56.168
His family was supposed
to make arrangements

23:56.202 --> 23:58.204
to pick him
up last week.

23:58.237 --> 23:59.572
Uh, there we are.

23:59.606 --> 24:01.173
( grunts )

24:01.207 --> 24:02.241
How is that?

24:02.274 --> 24:04.010
Perfect. Thank you.

24:04.043 --> 24:06.546
DUCKY:
Fascinating,
isn't it?

24:06.579 --> 24:09.181
Parts of three
separate bodies

24:09.215 --> 24:11.551
carved up with almost
surgical precision.

24:11.584 --> 24:13.252
Why?

24:13.285 --> 24:14.521
I haven't a clue.

24:14.954 --> 24:16.122
Now, we found them

24:16.155 --> 24:17.790
in a 55-gallon drum of alcohol

24:17.824 --> 24:20.793
behind Bethesda Naval
Hospital last month.

24:20.827 --> 24:21.594
McGee? Yeah.

24:21.628 --> 24:23.596
We're kind of
running short on time.

24:23.630 --> 24:25.532
Oh, can I give you a hand?

24:25.565 --> 24:26.398
No.

24:26.432 --> 24:28.100
( stammering ):
I'm all right.

24:28.134 --> 24:29.001
KATE:
When I'm a mother,

24:29.035 --> 24:30.870
I'm never letting my kids
out of my sight.

24:30.903 --> 24:32.605
Yeah? How do you plan
on doing that?

24:32.639 --> 24:34.073
GPS locator strapped
to the ankle,

24:34.106 --> 24:36.509
audio and video surveillance
built into their clothes.

24:36.543 --> 24:38.511
No, I mean the part
about becoming a mother.

24:38.545 --> 24:40.513
( wry laugh ):
Funny.

24:40.547 --> 24:41.614
The area looks clear to me.

24:41.648 --> 24:43.516
Me, too.
Let's go get that kid.

24:43.550 --> 24:44.617
( crying )

24:45.718 --> 24:47.253
( crying continues )

24:49.221 --> 24:50.590
Sandy?

24:50.623 --> 24:51.558
My name's Kate.

24:51.591 --> 24:52.559
And I'm Tony.

24:52.592 --> 24:53.560
We're NCIS agents.

24:53.593 --> 24:54.861
That stands for...

24:54.894 --> 24:57.163
I know what it stands for.

24:57.196 --> 24:59.198
They spoke at my school.

24:59.231 --> 25:01.300
Well, then you know
that we're here to help you.

25:01.333 --> 25:02.835
Your daddy sent us.

25:02.869 --> 25:04.637
We know what happened to you
and your mom,

25:04.671 --> 25:06.639
but you're safe
now, okay?

25:06.673 --> 25:08.641
I heard him.

25:08.675 --> 25:09.441
Heard who, honey?

25:09.475 --> 25:12.679
He didn't know it,
but I heard him.

25:12.712 --> 25:14.280
( sniffles )

25:14.313 --> 25:16.616
He told my mom

25:16.649 --> 25:19.552
he... he...

25:21.721 --> 25:25.224
...he's going
to make my dad suffer.

25:27.927 --> 25:29.662
What the hell is it?

25:29.696 --> 25:31.664
It's probably just some

25:31.698 --> 25:33.232
leftover
bodily fluid.

25:33.265 --> 25:34.266
Oh, is that all?

25:34.300 --> 25:35.267
Yeah.

25:35.301 --> 25:36.268
Disgusting.

25:36.302 --> 25:37.303
DUCKY:
If you want to be

25:37.336 --> 25:38.605
a full-time field agent,

25:38.638 --> 25:39.639
Timothy, you're gonna have

25:39.672 --> 25:40.773
to get used to sights like that.

25:40.807 --> 25:41.774
( sighs )

25:41.808 --> 25:43.175
This a common occurrence,
Ducky--

25:43.209 --> 25:45.645
dismembered bodies
in barrels of alcohol?

25:45.678 --> 25:47.146
Well, now that
you mention it,

25:47.179 --> 25:49.682
I did have a great
uncle who drowned

25:49.716 --> 25:51.584
in a vat of alcohol.

25:51.618 --> 25:53.586
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

25:53.620 --> 25:55.688
Of course, he reportedly
climbed out three times

25:55.722 --> 25:57.790
to go to the bathroom.

26:01.027 --> 26:02.228
Hey.

26:02.261 --> 26:03.295
What's the holdup?

26:03.329 --> 26:04.931
ABBY:
We are almost
set here.

26:04.964 --> 26:07.900
McGee, if I were you,

26:07.934 --> 26:10.703
I would spend more time working,
and less time cleaning.

26:10.737 --> 26:11.971
Yes.

26:12.004 --> 26:13.740
Yes. Sorry, boss.

26:13.773 --> 26:16.776
Duck, got a patient
upstairs for you.

26:23.750 --> 26:26.686
There you go.

26:26.719 --> 26:28.220
Feel better now?

26:28.254 --> 26:29.722
Yes.

26:29.756 --> 26:30.723
Thank you.

26:30.757 --> 26:32.692
You've been
a very brave patient,

26:32.725 --> 26:34.761
so I think
you deserve a surprise.

26:34.794 --> 26:36.729
A Hershey bar?

26:36.763 --> 26:37.730
Yes.

26:37.764 --> 26:41.033
Are you sure you're blind?

26:41.067 --> 26:42.635
I can smell it.

26:42.669 --> 26:43.670
Ah.

26:43.703 --> 26:44.904
I'll be right back, Sandy.

26:44.937 --> 26:47.173
I need a few moments
to talk to my friends.

26:51.978 --> 26:53.980
TONY:
It took him 45 minutes
to drop her off.

26:54.013 --> 26:55.715
You figure 22 minutes out,
same back.

26:55.748 --> 26:58.084
Leaves a 15-mile radius
where he could be located.

26:58.117 --> 26:59.852
Hundreds of square miles
and what?

26:59.886 --> 27:01.688
We have two hours left.

27:01.721 --> 27:04.657
We also pulled tapes
from the train station.

27:04.691 --> 27:08.060
Might catch a shot of him
dropping the kid off.

27:08.094 --> 27:10.229
Gibbs, it's, like,
100 degrees in here.

27:10.262 --> 27:12.098
How can you drink that stuff?

27:12.131 --> 27:14.100
Keeps me cool.

27:14.133 --> 27:15.668
How's she doing, Duck?

27:15.702 --> 27:18.304
Remarkably well,
considering the circumstances.

27:18.337 --> 27:19.338
What does she remember?

27:19.371 --> 27:20.940
Unfortunately, everything.

27:20.973 --> 27:22.308
Except for
where she was.

27:22.341 --> 27:23.843
Maybe you haven't asked

27:23.876 --> 27:25.111
the right questions.

27:25.144 --> 27:27.146
Well, she's eight
and blind, Ducky.

27:27.179 --> 27:29.816
I mean, it's not a great help
in a situation like...

27:31.050 --> 27:34.887
( whispers ):
Sandy, are you thirsty?

27:34.921 --> 27:37.690
A little bit.

27:37.724 --> 27:39.859
Can I have some water?

27:42.829 --> 27:44.330
( computer beeping )

27:44.363 --> 27:46.065
McGEE:
Okay.

27:46.098 --> 27:47.834
I'm back in.

27:47.867 --> 27:49.902
Initiating a back-trace
from Watson's computer.

27:49.936 --> 27:52.304
How you doing with Bad Guy's
onboard encryption?

27:52.338 --> 27:56.042
It's commercial grade,
so consider it cracked

27:56.075 --> 27:58.044
right... now.

27:58.077 --> 28:00.146
( beep and static )

28:02.181 --> 28:03.916
Yes, Team McGee does it again.

28:03.950 --> 28:05.351
Why Team McGee?

28:05.384 --> 28:07.920
No offense.
I am the Special Agent.

28:08.955 --> 28:10.156
Yeah.

28:10.189 --> 28:11.824
Must have switched off
the audio.

28:11.858 --> 28:14.326
Team Abby.
I'm the smart one.

28:14.360 --> 28:16.328
( muffled groaning )

28:16.362 --> 28:17.764
( sobbing )

28:17.797 --> 28:20.166
You want to
scream, scream.

28:20.199 --> 28:22.434
No one will hear you.

28:23.469 --> 28:26.405
( crying continues )

28:26.438 --> 28:30.109
GIBBS:
Sandy, this is
really important.

28:30.142 --> 28:32.879
Can you tell us anything about
the car you were driven in?

28:32.912 --> 28:35.748
Well, it was a van,

28:35.782 --> 28:39.351
and there were no windows
in back.

28:39.385 --> 28:40.419
How could you tell?

28:41.888 --> 28:44.824
Because I couldn't feel the sun
on my face.

28:44.857 --> 28:45.624
What about the place

28:45.657 --> 28:47.293
he was keeping you
and your mom--

28:47.326 --> 28:49.428
anything unusual
about it?

28:49.461 --> 28:50.897
( sniffs )

28:50.930 --> 28:52.231
I don't know.

28:52.264 --> 28:54.366
I was real scared, and...

28:54.400 --> 28:55.301
and I could

28:55.334 --> 28:56.803
hear him talking
to my mom,

28:56.836 --> 28:58.470
and she was crying, and...

28:58.504 --> 28:59.906
( phone rings )

28:59.939 --> 29:01.808
...and he kept on
pulling my hair.

29:01.841 --> 29:02.842
KATE:
It's okay, Sandy.

29:02.875 --> 29:04.510
Just tell us
what you remember.

29:04.543 --> 29:05.611
Yeah. Gibbs.

29:05.644 --> 29:06.979
( Abby speaks indistinctly
over phone )

29:07.013 --> 29:10.182
Right. We're on our way.

29:10.216 --> 29:12.118
Sandy, I want
you to stay here

29:12.151 --> 29:13.185
with Dr. Mallard.

29:13.219 --> 29:14.386
We have to check...

29:14.420 --> 29:15.554
I heard.

29:15.587 --> 29:18.925
You can see my mom
on your computer now.

29:18.958 --> 29:20.226
( sniffles )

29:20.259 --> 29:23.495
I hear lots of things
other kids can't.

29:23.529 --> 29:25.531
Can I help you?

29:30.937 --> 29:36.909
( music plays over headphones,
Jill sobs over speaker )

29:36.943 --> 29:37.776
( sobbing )

29:37.810 --> 29:39.511
Your husband has less
than two hours

29:39.545 --> 29:42.048
to make my deadline.

29:42.081 --> 29:44.416
I'm engaging
the audio filters now.

29:44.450 --> 29:46.452
There'll be a slight delay
with picture.

29:46.485 --> 29:48.955
( sobbing continues )

29:48.988 --> 29:51.323
( normal voice ):
But what he doesn't know...

29:51.357 --> 29:54.861
is that if he
makes it or not,

29:54.894 --> 29:56.829
you're never
going home.

29:56.863 --> 30:00.266
( shuddering )

30:15.447 --> 30:17.549
MAN:
Time's running out, Captain.

30:17.583 --> 30:20.953
Look, I've been able
to isolate 1.8 million.

30:20.987 --> 30:23.622
If I send it now,
will you release my wife?

30:23.655 --> 30:27.093
( distorted ):
How about I send you back
1.8 of your wife?

30:27.126 --> 30:29.195
You want me to keep an arm
or a leg?

30:29.228 --> 30:32.364
Captain, we need more time.

30:32.398 --> 30:33.365
You have to stall him.

30:33.399 --> 30:36.002
It's getting harder

30:36.035 --> 30:37.603
to find open accounts.

30:37.636 --> 30:40.139
You're gonna have to give me
more time.

30:40.172 --> 30:41.073
MAN ( distorted ):
You have 90 minutes.

30:41.107 --> 30:44.210
Make it, your wife lives,
don't, she dies.

30:44.243 --> 30:45.477
It's your call, Captain.

30:45.511 --> 30:47.479
Negotiate, Captain.

30:47.513 --> 30:50.216
Tell him you need
at least three more hours.

30:51.683 --> 30:56.855
I repeat, tell him
you need another three hours.

30:57.689 --> 30:59.258
I'll meet your deadline.

30:59.291 --> 31:01.593
Ah, damn!

31:01.627 --> 31:02.995
Good news, boss.

31:03.029 --> 31:04.997
( breathless ):
I found a shot...

31:05.031 --> 31:07.233
of our bad guy's vehicle
on the train station tapes.

31:07.266 --> 31:08.334
The little girl was right:

31:08.367 --> 31:11.003
It's a white van
with no windows.
You run the plates?

31:11.037 --> 31:12.204
Came back stolen.

31:12.238 --> 31:15.074
And this helps me because,
DiNozzo?

31:15.107 --> 31:16.508
I also I.D.'d our dirtbag.

31:16.542 --> 31:17.676
I pulled his
prints from

31:17.709 --> 31:19.979
Sandy's, uh, hair thingies.

31:20.012 --> 31:22.181
Berets.

31:22.214 --> 31:24.150
Right. He's a former
petty officer.

31:24.183 --> 31:26.318
Name's Kyle Grayson.

31:26.352 --> 31:28.955
Did six years in Leavenworth

31:28.988 --> 31:31.123
for embezzling
government funds.

31:31.157 --> 31:33.025
And Captain Watson
was responsible

31:33.059 --> 31:35.061
for putting him there.

31:38.530 --> 31:40.699
Good job.

31:40.732 --> 31:42.201
We're going to play some sounds

31:42.234 --> 31:44.203
from the room that
you were in, Sandy.

31:44.236 --> 31:46.038
We think it might help you
remember better.

31:46.072 --> 31:49.208
Can you just play certain hertz,
if I want you to?

31:49.241 --> 31:50.609
Sure. How'd you know that?

31:50.642 --> 31:53.079
From the piano.

31:53.112 --> 31:55.414
I know the number of vibrations
of every key.

31:55.447 --> 31:58.117
Like key number
44-- E-four:

31:58.150 --> 31:59.385
That's three hundred

31:59.418 --> 32:02.654
and 29.63 hertz.

32:02.688 --> 32:05.591
A-five is 880.

32:05.624 --> 32:07.693
My mom says I'm half bat.

32:07.726 --> 32:09.962
Well, that's cool.
I love bats.

32:09.996 --> 32:10.997
Me, too.

32:11.030 --> 32:12.999
I like your voice, Abby.

32:13.032 --> 32:14.166
It's kind of gravelly.

32:14.200 --> 32:15.501
Thank you.

32:15.534 --> 32:18.304
All right, you ready
to show off for us?

32:19.471 --> 32:20.606
( computer beeps once )

32:20.639 --> 32:22.441
GRAYSON:
Lorton Amtrak station.

32:22.474 --> 32:24.676
You got your good faith gesture.
Now get back to work.

32:25.677 --> 32:27.513
There's birds, up kind of high.

32:27.546 --> 32:29.381
Try a G-seven,

32:29.415 --> 32:31.217
the 83rd key.

32:31.250 --> 32:35.121
That's 3,136 hertz.

32:35.154 --> 32:38.057
( Grayson's voice in background,
singing birds predominate )

32:38.090 --> 32:39.491
That is amazing, Sandy.

32:40.292 --> 32:41.527
I'll be right back.

32:43.162 --> 32:44.663
Gibbs, she's incredible.

32:44.696 --> 32:47.199
You got to see her...
I want her listening
to the live feed.

32:47.233 --> 32:49.035
Gibbs, she's been
traumatized enough.

32:49.068 --> 32:54.540
Yeah? How about growing up
without a mother... Kate?

32:57.076 --> 32:59.145
Hey, Sandy, I need you to...

32:59.178 --> 33:01.213
Listen to the live feed.

33:01.247 --> 33:02.381
I want to help

33:02.414 --> 33:04.183
my mom, Agent Gibbs.

33:04.216 --> 33:07.553
I can take it.

33:09.255 --> 33:10.789
GIBBS:
Here.

33:10.822 --> 33:12.424
What's this?

33:12.458 --> 33:14.560
Your very own NCIS badge.

33:15.461 --> 33:17.263
You ready?
Yes.

33:18.297 --> 33:20.466
McGee...

33:20.499 --> 33:22.234
bring the live feed
up on the speakers.

33:22.268 --> 33:26.772
Sandy, we need to know
anything you can tell us

33:26.805 --> 33:29.641
about where
he is keeping your mom.

33:29.675 --> 33:32.311
GRAYSON:
When I took this job,

33:32.344 --> 33:36.382
I was instructed not to hurt you
or the little princess,

33:36.415 --> 33:40.652
but your husband...
cost me six years.

33:40.686 --> 33:43.489
JILL ( panting ):
Who hired you?

33:43.522 --> 33:46.325
GRAYSON:
I don't really care.

33:46.358 --> 33:50.196
The point is, I've decided your
husband has to pay for that.

33:50.229 --> 33:51.663
JILL ( crying ):
Why?

33:51.697 --> 33:53.332
GRAYSON:
No more questions.

33:53.365 --> 33:55.734
( slap )
( Jill cries out )

33:55.767 --> 33:56.835
Keep asking questions,

33:56.868 --> 33:59.338
and you're gonna change my mind
about hurting her...

33:59.371 --> 34:02.341
Go in the area of A-7.

34:02.374 --> 34:06.345
I need 4,000 hertz.

34:07.546 --> 34:12.351
Bring it two keys down.
I mean, 3,800.

34:14.386 --> 34:16.688
( clacking, rumbling )
Sounds like a train.

34:16.722 --> 34:18.190
SANDY:
It's getting closer.

34:18.224 --> 34:22.694
It's passing right... now.

34:22.728 --> 34:23.829
1706.

34:23.862 --> 34:26.132
What time's the next train
scheduled to arrive in Lorton?

34:26.165 --> 34:27.199
I'm on it, boss.

34:29.901 --> 34:32.438
Can you remember anything else
about the train sounds?

34:32.471 --> 34:35.707
We drove over a lot
of tracks.

34:35.741 --> 34:38.877
My mom... she...

34:38.910 --> 34:41.347
she squeezed my
hand every time.

34:42.914 --> 34:43.415
How many times?

34:43.449 --> 34:44.883
I don't know. A lot.

34:44.916 --> 34:45.884
( Jill cries out )

34:45.917 --> 34:48.220
What is he doing to her?

34:48.254 --> 34:50.422
Why is she crying?

34:53.292 --> 34:54.526
You did great, Sandy.

34:55.327 --> 34:57.563
Are you going to save

34:57.596 --> 34:59.865
my mom now?
Oh, yeah,
you can count on that.

34:59.898 --> 35:01.500
Let's roll.

35:10.242 --> 35:11.810
Hey.

35:11.843 --> 35:15.881
The only train in the area
is an Amtrak.

35:15.914 --> 35:18.617
It left DC at... 1620

35:18.650 --> 35:20.186
and arrived Lorton 1730.

35:20.219 --> 35:22.221
Average speed of
65 miles an hour.

35:22.254 --> 35:25.891
Now, we know it passed
our dirtbag at 1706, right?

35:25.924 --> 35:27.693
So...

35:30.529 --> 35:31.863
Damn it!

35:31.897 --> 35:34.300
I owe Mrs. Powers
an apology.

35:34.333 --> 35:35.301
Who?

35:35.334 --> 35:36.502
My tenth grade
math teacher.

35:36.535 --> 35:38.204
I told her I'd never
be able to use

35:38.237 --> 35:39.538
anything she taught
us in real life.

35:39.571 --> 35:40.806
It's here,
seven miles outside

35:40.839 --> 35:41.273
of Lorton.

35:43.409 --> 35:44.643
There's an abandoned

35:44.676 --> 35:45.911
train maintenance yard
about a half-mile north.

35:45.944 --> 35:46.512
That's the place.

35:46.545 --> 35:47.112
McGee...

35:47.145 --> 35:48.280
you need to tell Watson

35:48.314 --> 35:49.681
to delay sending
the money.

35:49.715 --> 35:50.349
Well, how?

35:50.382 --> 35:51.283
Any way you can.

35:51.317 --> 35:52.318
Come on, let's go.

35:52.951 --> 35:53.485
Now.

35:54.620 --> 35:55.954
DISTORTED VOICE:
Five minutes left.

35:55.987 --> 35:58.790
Tell me you have
the two million, Captain.

35:58.824 --> 36:00.792
I have it.

36:00.826 --> 36:03.495
DISTORTED VOICE:
Stand by to copy the ISP
and routing number.

36:03.529 --> 36:08.234
ISP is CS.CN.ACN.

36:08.267 --> 36:08.934
Read it back to me.

36:08.967 --> 36:13.939
CS.CN.ACN.

36:16.642 --> 36:17.976
Beijing?

36:18.009 --> 36:20.346
DISTORTED VOICE:
Very good, Captain.

36:21.813 --> 36:24.850
( tires screeching )

36:35.361 --> 36:36.995
McGee, talk to me.

36:37.028 --> 36:38.297
Okay, he's giving Watson

36:38.330 --> 36:39.231
the wire transfer code.

36:39.265 --> 36:40.266
Do you have a visual yet?

36:41.333 --> 36:42.000
GIBBS:
Negative.

36:42.033 --> 36:42.968
Tell the captain he has to stall

36:43.001 --> 36:44.202
for more time.

36:45.304 --> 36:46.372
Captain Watson,
you have to buy us

36:46.405 --> 36:47.606
a few more minutes--
I repeat,

36:47.639 --> 36:50.442
you have to buy us
a few more minutes.

36:51.877 --> 36:53.345
He's not listening to me.

36:53.379 --> 36:55.681
Tell him the second he
transfers that money,

36:55.714 --> 36:56.682
his wife is dead.

36:56.715 --> 36:57.383
Captain Watson,

36:57.416 --> 36:58.384
your wife is going to be mur...

36:58.417 --> 37:01.287
( feedback blaring )
Ow! Okay, Gibbs,

37:01.320 --> 37:02.020
he took out the earwig.

37:02.053 --> 37:03.689
I got nothing, boss.

37:03.722 --> 37:06.358
DISTORTED VOICE:
The routing number is A121...

37:06.392 --> 37:09.027
3669...

37:09.060 --> 37:10.028
B1.

37:10.061 --> 37:11.863
Read that back to me.

37:11.897 --> 37:15.867
A1213669B1.

37:15.901 --> 37:17.269
DISTORTED VOICE:
That's correct.

37:17.303 --> 37:18.270
Now make me rich.

37:20.839 --> 37:23.909
And I have your word
you're going to release my wife?

37:23.942 --> 37:25.444
DISTORTED VOICE:
Yes, my word.

37:25.477 --> 37:26.812
( Jill shrieking )

37:29.581 --> 37:30.949
Now send it.

37:36.988 --> 37:38.890
He's sending the money to Asia.

37:38.924 --> 37:40.859
If I can tag his transmission
with a marker,

37:40.892 --> 37:41.993
we might be able to follow it.

37:42.027 --> 37:44.463
Gibbs, he sent it-- I... I think
he's going to shoot her.

37:44.496 --> 37:44.996
What do I do?

37:45.030 --> 37:45.997
Something, McGee.

37:46.031 --> 37:47.366
Anything.

37:52.704 --> 37:54.406
( whimpers )

37:54.440 --> 37:55.941
McGEE:
This is the FBI, Grayson.

37:55.974 --> 37:57.509
We have you surrounded.

37:57.543 --> 37:59.378
Come out with your hands
in the air.

37:59.411 --> 38:00.011
What the hell?

38:00.045 --> 38:01.413
You didn't really think

38:01.447 --> 38:03.449
you'd get away with this...

38:08.354 --> 38:10.422
( gunfire )

38:14.960 --> 38:16.762
You two, inside.

38:16.795 --> 38:19.431
I'll cut him off.
We take him alive.

38:26.104 --> 38:27.606
Come on, let's go.

38:27.639 --> 38:29.074
Come on!

38:29.107 --> 38:30.008
Go.

38:30.041 --> 38:32.578
( whimpering )

38:36.448 --> 38:37.015
Clear.

38:40.619 --> 38:41.520
Move!

38:55.066 --> 38:55.934
Go!

39:00.472 --> 39:01.440
Come on!

39:02.641 --> 39:04.576
You come any closer,
and I'll shoot her!

39:05.677 --> 39:07.145
Come out where
I can see you!

39:07.178 --> 39:08.146
Now!

39:08.179 --> 39:11.517
( whispering ):
Just like in Colombia.

39:13.519 --> 39:15.654
You're not getting
out of here, Grayson.

39:15.687 --> 39:16.888
It's over.

39:16.922 --> 39:17.989
I know the FBI's SOP.

39:18.023 --> 39:21.159
I want a cell phone
and negotiator now!

39:21.192 --> 39:24.896
We're not the FBI, dirtbag.

39:27.766 --> 39:29.100
Drop the weapon.

39:33.872 --> 39:36.508
( crying )

39:41.847 --> 39:43.982
Everything's going to be
all right now, sweetheart.

39:44.015 --> 39:45.016
Everything.

39:46.952 --> 39:49.020
Kind of makes you think.

39:49.054 --> 39:50.522
About what?

39:50.556 --> 39:53.391
Having kids someday.

39:54.192 --> 39:56.027
Yeah.

39:56.061 --> 39:58.163
I don't think
I could handle that.

40:00.499 --> 40:03.969
Don't know how we can
ever thank you, Agent Gibbs.

40:04.970 --> 40:07.606
We owe you so much.

40:07.639 --> 40:10.609
Thank Special
Agent Watson here.

40:10.642 --> 40:12.878
We couldn't have
done without her.

40:12.911 --> 40:14.179
Thanks.

40:23.154 --> 40:24.490
We did good today,
Gibbs.

40:24.523 --> 40:27.493
Did we, Special
Agent Todd?

40:27.526 --> 40:29.661
Grayson doesn't have
the smarts

40:29.695 --> 40:31.997
to be in this alone.

40:32.030 --> 40:34.065
We still have to find out
who hired him.

40:34.099 --> 40:35.701
Not going to get it
from Grayson.

40:35.734 --> 40:36.835
Why not?

40:36.868 --> 40:38.870
Get him to roll
for a deal.

40:39.905 --> 40:41.039
I don't deal.

40:42.708 --> 40:44.142
He doesn't deal?

40:44.175 --> 40:47.579
Not when Grayson doesn't know
who hired him.

40:47.613 --> 40:49.214
McGEE:
This guy's good.

40:49.247 --> 40:51.550
We lost the money
for a little while in Hong Kong.

40:51.583 --> 40:53.151
But McGee's bots
picked it up again

40:53.184 --> 40:54.553
on the transfer
to Zurich.

40:54.586 --> 40:55.987
And with Abby's
encryption algorithm

40:56.021 --> 40:59.057
imbedded in the transaction,
it's just...
Okay, look, j-just for a sec,

40:59.090 --> 41:01.226
just pretend that I don't know
anything about computers.

41:01.259 --> 41:01.893
Pretend?

41:01.927 --> 41:03.161
Can we get this guy or not?

41:03.194 --> 41:06.264
Well, we've been
following the money
for the last eight hours,

41:06.297 --> 41:07.666
and if it transfers
into a country

41:07.699 --> 41:09.701
where we have juris...

41:09.735 --> 41:11.570
Wait.

41:12.604 --> 41:13.705
I don't believe this.

41:13.739 --> 41:14.573
What?

41:16.274 --> 41:17.475
McGEE:
It's headed
back here.

41:19.044 --> 41:20.646
Washington, DC.

41:37.729 --> 41:40.966
Captain Watson...

41:40.999 --> 41:42.534
Agent Gibbs.

41:42.568 --> 41:43.969
This is not what you think.

41:44.002 --> 41:46.271
You're right. It wasn't.

41:47.873 --> 41:49.675
You did this to your own family?

41:49.708 --> 41:51.577
No, nobody was supposed
to get hurt.

41:53.244 --> 41:54.980
That tight enough
for you, Captain?

41:55.013 --> 41:58.049
I can't believe
this is happening.

41:58.083 --> 41:59.585
The perfect plan.

41:59.618 --> 42:01.186
Even Grayson didn't know
who hired him.

42:01.219 --> 42:02.788
How the hell'd
you figure this out?

42:02.821 --> 42:03.755
KATE:
Next time...

42:03.789 --> 42:06.024
you might want to send your note
to the FBI.

42:06.057 --> 42:08.927
Look, you got to understand...
I needed

42:08.960 --> 42:11.062
the money because...

42:11.096 --> 42:12.798
( grunting )

42:12.831 --> 42:13.932
Don't you dare

42:13.965 --> 42:15.767
tell me that there's
a reason

42:15.801 --> 42:19.738
for you throwing away
what you had.

42:43.895 --> 42:46.665
Your network is up
and operational now, so, uh,

42:46.698 --> 42:48.834
be heading back
to Norfolk.

42:52.170 --> 42:54.740
I'll take that
as a thank you.

42:56.074 --> 42:57.843
McGee,

42:57.876 --> 42:58.977
where you going?

42:59.010 --> 43:00.712
Uh, Norfolk.

43:00.746 --> 43:03.949
Well, I got some good news
and some bad news for you.

43:03.982 --> 43:05.784
You've just been promoted...

43:05.817 --> 43:07.953
to a full-time field agent.

43:08.987 --> 43:10.088
McGEE:
Really?

43:10.121 --> 43:12.157
That's incredible.
Wha-What's...?

43:12.190 --> 43:13.925
You belong to me now.

43:14.760 --> 43:16.127
Congratulations.

43:16.161 --> 43:18.229
Yeah... what she said.

43:18.263 --> 43:20.666
Wait, so...

43:20.699 --> 43:22.100
I-I'm one
of you guys now, right?

43:22.133 --> 43:23.401
Uh, no more...
no more

43:23.434 --> 43:25.671
getting coffee,
no more hazing?

43:25.704 --> 43:26.137
KATE & TONY:
Sure.

43:26.171 --> 43:27.272
McGEE:
Right.

43:27.305 --> 43:29.407
Uh, well, I just want
to say, uh,

43:29.440 --> 43:34.079
I never took it personal, and
I-I really look forward to...

43:35.847 --> 43:36.815
You know, I could

43:36.848 --> 43:37.816
really get used to that.

43:39.450 --> 43:40.451
