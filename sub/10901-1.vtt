hence the word "ensemble,"

11:08.794 --> 11:11.756
the nature of the music
is such that,

11:11.756 --> 11:15.967

go over the plan?

24:05.570 --> 24:06.904
(CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING)

24:06.904 --> 24:10.783
Gentlemen, this is
the  Bandit Queen.

24:10.783 --> 24:12.618
The gambling den.
Cash cow.

24:12.618 --> 24:14.120
Sodom of the
Mississippi Delta

24:14.120 --> 24:15.955
and the focus of our
little exercise.

24:17.499 --> 24:19.000
Here is Orchard Street.

24:19.000 --> 24:21.419
Here is the residence
of Marva Munson,

24:21.419 --> 24:24.088
the charming lady whom
you all met moments ago.

24:24.088 --> 24:26.424
Gentlemen, I'm sure
you're all aware

24:26.424 --> 24:29.594
that the solons of the state
of Mississippi, to wit,
its legislature,

24:29.594 --> 24:32.471
have decreed that no gaming
establishment shall be erected

24:32.471 --> 24:34.516
within its borders
upon dry land.

24:34.516 --> 24:37.519
They may, however,
legally float.

24:37.519 --> 24:39.312
While the gambling activity

24:39.312 --> 24:40.980
is restricted to
these riverboats,

24:40.980 --> 24:43.316
no such restrictions apply
to the functions ancillary

24:43.316 --> 24:45.234
to this cash-besotted
business.

24:45.234 --> 24:47.696
The casino's offices,
locker rooms,

24:47.696 --> 24:51.616
facilities to cook and clean,
and, most importantly,
its counting houses.

24:51.616 --> 24:56.538
The reinforced, secret,
super-secure repositories
of the lucre

24:56.538 --> 24:59.290
may all be
situated wherever.

24:59.290 --> 25:00.791
(INHALES DEEPLY)

25:00.791 --> 25:04.003
Gawain, where is
"wherever"?

25:04.546 --> 25:05.338
Say what?

25:07.173 --> 25:08.925
Where's the money?
Oh...

25:09.676 --> 25:10.885
Okay, look.

25:10.885 --> 25:12.678
At the end of every shift,

25:12.678 --> 25:14.263
the pit boss brings
the cash down

25:14.263 --> 25:16.974
to the hold of the ship
in a locked cashbox,

25:16.974 --> 25:19.393
then once a day
all the cash is moved
down to the countin' room.

25:22.564 --> 25:24.523
And where is
the counting room?

25:25.191 --> 25:26.859
Well...

25:26.859 --> 25:30.154
It be right there
in that square
where you pointin'.

25:30.154 --> 25:33.700
And what,
to flog a horse
that if not dead

25:33.700 --> 25:36.285
is at this point
in mortal danger
of expiring,

25:36.285 --> 25:38.037
does this little
square represent?

25:39.872 --> 25:42.584

Underground.

25:42.584 --> 25:45.211
Hah! Underground.

25:45.211 --> 25:46.253
Mmm...

25:47.254 --> 25:48.422
Underground.

25:49.924 --> 25:52.134
During the casino's
hours of operation,

25:52.134 --> 25:55.262
the door to this counting room
is fiercely guarded.

25:55.262 --> 25:57.264
The door itself
is of redoubtable
Pittsburgh steel.

25:57.264 --> 25:58.891
When the casino closes,

25:58.891 --> 26:01.185
this entire underground
complex is locked up,

26:01.185 --> 26:04.146
and the armed guard retreats
to the casino's main entrance.

26:05.189 --> 26:08.735
There, then,
far from the guard,

26:08.735 --> 26:10.361
reposes the money,

26:10.361 --> 26:13.197
behind a five-inch-thick
steel portal, yes.

26:14.532 --> 26:17.243
But the walls,
gentlemen,

26:17.243 --> 26:21.497
the walls are but
humble masonry.

26:21.497 --> 26:26.544
Behind which is only
the soft, loamy soil
deposited over centuries

26:26.544 --> 26:28.254
by the old man,

26:28.254 --> 26:29.922
the meanderin'
Mississippi,

26:29.922 --> 26:32.216
as it fanned its way
back and forth

26:32.216 --> 26:35.094
across the great
alluvial plain,
leaving earth.

26:37.805 --> 26:39.056
This earth.

26:42.059 --> 26:45.896
The General here,
whose curriculum vitae
comprehends

26:45.896 --> 26:49.608

through the soil of his native
French Indochina,

26:49.608 --> 26:53.070
shall be directin' our little
old tunnelin' operation.

26:53.070 --> 26:55.489
Garth Pancake,
though a master of none,

26:55.489 --> 26:59.827
is a jack of all those trades
corollary to our aim.

26:59.827 --> 27:02.329
He will be doin'
such fabricatin' and
demolition work

27:02.329 --> 27:04.081
as our little caper
shall require.

27:04.081 --> 27:05.750
Happy to be on board.

27:05.750 --> 27:09.045
Gawain is our proverbial
"inside man."

27:09.045 --> 27:11.422
He has managed to
secure himself

27:11.422 --> 27:13.799
a berth on the custodial staff
of the  Bandit Queen.

27:13.799 --> 27:15.634
Damn, skippy.

27:15.634 --> 27:18.929
And this brings us
to Lump.

27:18.929 --> 27:20.723
To look at Lump,
you might wonder

27:20.723 --> 27:23.392
what specialized expertise

27:23.392 --> 27:27.689
could he possibly offer
our merry little old band
of miscreants.

27:27.689 --> 27:32.526
Well, gentlemen,
in a project of such risks,
it is imperative

27:32.526 --> 27:36.030
to enlist the services
of a hooligan, a goon,
an ape, a physical brute.

27:36.030 --> 27:38.491
Someone who will be
our security,

27:38.491 --> 27:42.787
our battering ram,
our blunt instrument.

27:42.787 --> 27:46.040
And, on our behalf,
I wish him a warm
Mississippi welcome.

27:46.040 --> 27:47.709
Fuckin' A.
Wassup, my nigga?

27:47.709 --> 27:49.502
Well, gentlemen,
here you are.

27:51.045 --> 27:53.881

and differing talents.

27:53.881 --> 27:56.133
Men with, in fact,
but two things in common.

27:56.133 --> 27:59.553
One, you all saw fit
to answer my advertisement
in the  Memphis Scimitar,

27:59.553 --> 28:01.305
and, two,
you're all going to be,
in consequence,

28:01.305 --> 28:03.933
very, very,
incredibly rich.

our adventure, gentlemen.

28:10.981 --> 28:13.442
and, by all means,
let us keep this
to ourselves.

in this root cellar,

28:16.695 --> 28:18.072

a break anyway.

very demanding,

welcome a moment of R and R.

maybe you'd like to see...

gotten into, honey?

ever turned his hand...

33:28.216 --> 33:30.134
(LAUGHS)

33:30.134 --> 33:33.720
Or turned his lip
to blowing the shofar?

sounded by the priests
of the Hebrews.

nothin' about that.

for no fucking candy bar.

36:26.560 --> 36:29.229
Uh, we've had a bit
of a setback on
the tunneling front, too.

36:29.229 --> 36:31.273
We've run into
a pretty large rock.

36:31.273 --> 36:32.190
GENERAL: Rock.

36:35.193 --> 36:37.237
Very bad.
Very bad.

36:37.988 --> 36:38.739
Oh, my.

36:41.575 --> 36:44.370
Seems that
the poet was right.

36:45.537 --> 36:48.790
Troubles never
singly come.

36:48.790 --> 36:50.792
Oh, no, we can
get through the rock.
No worries there.

36:50.792 --> 36:53.128
Easiest thing in the world.
Why, we just blow
right through it.

36:53.128 --> 36:54.546
I got a pyro license.

36:54.546 --> 36:56.715
Just bore a hole
in the rock

36:56.715 --> 36:58.550
and pack in
a little plastique.

36:58.550 --> 37:00.552
Igneous blows
pretty good.

37:00.552 --> 37:02.430
And then we just...
Hello, Garth.

37:02.430 --> 37:04.514
Am I ordering
the primer cord?
PANCAKE: Yes, Mountain.

37:04.514 --> 37:06.600
We were just
talking about that,
and some plastique.

37:08.394 --> 37:09.311
What the fuck is this?

37:09.311 --> 37:11.397
Oh, this is Mountain Girl.

37:11.397 --> 37:14.524
Mountain is my right hand.
She helps me out
with ordnance.

37:14.524 --> 37:16.902
Helps me with
damn near everything.
Hey.

37:18.445 --> 37:21.282
You brought yo' bitch
to the Waffle Hut?

37:21.282 --> 37:22.449
(DORR CLEARS THROAT)

37:22.449 --> 37:26.370
I must confess myself
to be puzzled as well.

37:26.370 --> 37:28.580
I thought it was understood
that when it came to
our little enterprise,

37:29.456 --> 37:32.292
"mum" was the word.

37:32.292 --> 37:35.253
Of course, I understand that,
but this is Mountain Girl.

37:35.253 --> 37:37.465
I don't keep secrets
from Mountain.

37:37.465 --> 37:39.383
That's not how you
maintain a loving,
caring relationship.

37:40.676 --> 37:44.430
You brought your bitch
to the Waffle Hut.

37:44.430 --> 37:48.975
The man brought his bitch
to the Waffle Hut.

37:48.975 --> 37:50.852
All right, look, you,
I will thank you

37:50.852 --> 37:52.479
to stop referring
to Mountain that way.

37:52.479 --> 37:54.398
She is the other
half of my life.

37:54.398 --> 37:56.608
Everybody lookin' at me
like I'm some kind of fuck-up

37:56.608 --> 37:59.194
for losin'
a sorry-ass job,

37:59.194 --> 38:02.864
and this motherfucker
brings his bitch

38:02.864 --> 38:04.866
to the motherfucking
Waffle Hut.

38:04.866 --> 38:07.035
Son of a bitch punk.
Shut your goddamn mouth.

38:07.035 --> 38:08.662
You better raise
the fuck up, fucker.
(MOUNTAIN SCREAMS)

38:08.662 --> 38:10.038
Gentlemen, please.
Back the fuck up.

38:10.038 --> 38:11.456
You gonna back that
shit the fuck up.

38:11.456 --> 38:14.167
DORR: Gentlemen, please.
What? What?

38:14.167 --> 38:16.545
Please, gentlemen,
this behavior does you

38:16.545 --> 38:18.755
no credit in the eyes
of your colleagues,

38:18.755 --> 38:21.633
nor in those of the other
patrons of this Waffle Hut.

38:23.051 --> 38:24.553
PANCAKE: Punk.

38:24.553 --> 38:28.223
Oh, look at this.
I got blueberry syrup
on my safari jacket.

38:28.223 --> 38:32.185
Gentlemen, I propose
that we consider
the matter of this woman,

38:32.185 --> 38:34.062
Mountain Water...
Mountain Girl.

38:35.188 --> 38:36.857
I'm so very sorry.

38:36.857 --> 38:39.526
I propose that we consider
this matter closed.

38:39.526 --> 38:42.237
And we shall
choose to trust her

38:42.237 --> 38:44.781
since we have no choice,

38:44.781 --> 38:48.118
and since she shall share
only in Mr. Pancake's
portion of the booty.

38:48.118 --> 38:50.620
Of course.
Wouldn't have it
any other way.

38:50.620 --> 38:52.205
Yeah, you damn right
you won't.

38:52.205 --> 38:54.542
Up yours, punk.
Oh, fuck you and
the Swiss Miss.

38:54.542 --> 38:56.001
The matter of disposing

38:56.001 --> 38:58.420
of our igneous impediment
is also...
Coach... Coach...

38:59.337 --> 39:02.632
Coach, I...
Closed. Settled.

39:02.632 --> 39:06.136
That leaves us only
with the question of Gawain
retrieving his job.

39:07.471 --> 39:09.681
Coach, I...
Yes, Lump?

39:09.681 --> 39:11.391
Couldn't we just
bribe the guy?

39:14.269 --> 39:15.687
(SLOW MUSIC PLAYING)

39:30.619 --> 39:32.954
You are a readin' fool,
aren't you, Mr. Dorr?

39:35.290 --> 39:38.710
Yes, I must confess.

39:38.710 --> 39:41.046
I often find myself
more at home in these
ancient volumes

39:41.046 --> 39:43.715
than I do
in the hustle-bustle
of the modern world.

39:45.550 --> 39:49.137
To me, paradoxically,

39:49.137 --> 39:51.556
the literature
of the so-called
"dead tongues"

39:51.556 --> 39:53.767
holds more currency
than this morning's
newspaper.

39:55.685 --> 40:00.441
In these books,
in these volumes,

40:00.441 --> 40:03.777
there is the accumulated
wisdom of mankind,
which succors me

40:05.153 --> 40:08.323
when the day is hard and
the night lonely and long.

40:11.660 --> 40:12.619
Hmm.

40:13.621 --> 40:14.788
The wisdom of
mankind, huh?

40:15.914 --> 40:18.333
What about the wisdom
of the Lord?

40:18.333 --> 40:21.086
Oh, yes, yes,
the good book, mmm.

40:22.045 --> 40:25.882
I have found
reward in its pages.

40:25.882 --> 40:30.512
But, to me,
there are other
good books as well.

40:33.516 --> 40:38.562
Heavy volumes of antiquity
freighted with the insights
of man's glorious age.

40:41.273 --> 40:42.190
And then, of course,

40:44.442 --> 40:50.240
I just love, love, love
the works of
Mr. Edgar Allan Poe.

40:50.240 --> 40:52.325
Oh, I know who he was,
kind of spooky.

40:52.826 --> 40:54.703
No, madam, no, no.

40:55.662 --> 40:57.330
Not of this world,
it's true.

40:59.165 --> 41:01.209
He... (EXHALES)
He lived in a dream.

41:03.253 --> 41:04.170
An ancient dream.

41:08.049 --> 41:09.009
"Helen

41:10.677 --> 41:14.139
"thy beauty is to me

41:16.600 --> 41:19.185
"Like those Nicean
barks of yore

41:21.146 --> 41:24.983
"That gently, o'er
a perfumed sea

41:26.318 --> 41:30.238
"The weary wayworn
wanderer bore

41:30.238 --> 41:33.283
"To his own
native shore."

41:39.623 --> 41:40.665
Who was Helen?

41:42.585 --> 41:43.752
Some kind of whore
of Babylon?

41:43.752 --> 41:45.211
One doesn't know
who Helen was.

41:47.839 --> 41:51.426
But I picture her
as being very, very...

41:53.554 --> 41:54.763
Extremely

41:57.098 --> 41:57.933
pale.

42:04.814 --> 42:07.400
Mrs. Munson,
I have been trying

42:08.985 --> 42:13.823
to figure out some way
of expressin' my gratitude
to you

42:13.823 --> 42:18.536
for takin' in this (LAUGHS)
weary, wayworn wanderer.

42:20.956 --> 42:22.874
It's just a little
old present.

42:22.874 --> 42:25.043
Why, it's hardly
anything at all.

42:25.043 --> 42:29.798
Oh, why, Mr. Dorr.
You are a gallant man.

42:29.798 --> 42:32.008
Oh, madam, I blush,
I melt. No.

42:32.008 --> 42:34.135
I just happened to hear
of this gospel concert
tomorrow night,

42:34.135 --> 42:36.429
the Mighty,
Mighty Clouds of Joy,

42:36.429 --> 42:39.182
and I thought you and a friend
from church perhaps would...

42:39.182 --> 42:40.809
Yes, I have
a widow lady friend.

42:40.809 --> 42:43.103
The concert is
up in Memphis,

42:43.103 --> 42:46.606
so I have arranged
a car service to
transport you thither.

42:46.606 --> 42:47.774
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)
Ah...

42:49.985 --> 42:52.655
MRS. MUNSON:
Why, Sheriff Wyner.
How you doin'?

42:52.655 --> 42:54.489
Good evenin',
Mrs. Munson.

42:54.489 --> 42:55.824
I just stopped by here
to let you know

42:55.824 --> 42:57.701
I did have a talk
with Weemack,

42:57.701 --> 43:00.578
and he told me
he's gonna comply
with your request

43:00.578 --> 43:02.247
in keepin' that music
down and neighborly.

43:02.247 --> 43:04.165
So, you just go and have
yourself a pleasant evenin'.

43:04.165 --> 43:06.794
Wait a minute.
I got somebody that
I want you to meet.

43:06.794 --> 43:08.962
Ma'am, you know what?
I'm a little pressed for time.

43:08.962 --> 43:10.922
(CHUCKLES) You got a gang of
bank robbers you're chasin'?

43:10.922 --> 43:13.299
Come on in here
and say hello.

43:13.299 --> 43:15.427
Yeah, we were havin'
tea and...

43:24.144 --> 43:27.648
Bussed his own dishes.
You can always
tell a gentleman.

43:27.648 --> 43:28.982
Somebody was in here,
ma'am?

43:28.982 --> 43:30.650
Yeah, with me
and Othar.

43:30.650 --> 43:32.902
Well, you know what?
Maybe I'll catch him
the next time.

43:32.902 --> 43:35.530
Uh, come on up to his room
with me and say hello.

43:35.530 --> 43:37.700
Mrs. Munson, I got a family.
My wife got dinner
on the table.

43:37.700 --> 43:38.742
I really have to
be goin'.

43:38.742 --> 43:39.993
(DOOR CREAKING)

43:43.621 --> 43:46.541
Oh, my, he is neat.

43:46.541 --> 43:48.752
Yes, ma'am,
he very neat.

43:48.752 --> 43:51.379
He probably went
down to the cellar
to play with his friends.

43:53.465 --> 43:54.674
Ma'am, I really
got to be goin' now.

43:56.593 --> 43:59.220
What...
Ma'am, I really need
to be gettin' back.

44:01.556 --> 44:03.141
Mrs. Munson, don't...
You don't have to...

44:04.225 --> 44:05.685
Mrs. Munson?
(LAUGHS)

44:06.436 --> 44:09.272
Why, Professor.

44:09.272 --> 44:12.692
What in the world
are you doin' havin'
tea down there?

44:13.860 --> 44:16.154
SHERIFF: Mrs. Munson?
Oh, Lord Jesus.

44:25.872 --> 44:28.458
Mrs. Munson?
Land of Goshen, child.

44:28.458 --> 44:30.878
Come on out
from under there.

44:30.878 --> 44:33.338
Mrs. Munson,
my pager just went off.
I got to go.

44:34.714 --> 44:36.007
I'll meet you and
your friend later.

44:41.012 --> 44:43.891
That was refreshing.

44:43.891 --> 44:45.308
SHERIFF: Y'all have
a good evenin' now.

44:45.308 --> 44:47.811
As you know,
we academics are inordinately
fond of wedgin' ourselves

44:47.811 --> 44:49.938
into confined spaces.

44:49.938 --> 44:51.898
At Yale, the students

44:51.898 --> 44:53.734
will see how many
of their number

44:53.734 --> 44:55.944
they can enclose in
a telephone booth.

44:55.944 --> 44:57.237
At Harvard,
a broom closet.

44:57.987 --> 44:59.489
Hope I didn't
spill my tea.

45:01.116 --> 45:02.367
Well, what the hell
is this?

45:04.953 --> 45:07.539
I guess it's just
my way of sayin'...

45:10.041 --> 45:11.459
Well, God damn it,
Mr. Gudge.

45:12.961 --> 45:14.337
Look here, I...

45:14.337 --> 45:16.548
I don't know what it's like
walkin' in your shoes.

45:16.548 --> 45:19.927
You know, with you bein'
a tight-ass and all.

45:19.927 --> 45:22.637
And I'm pretty sure
you don't know what it's like
walkin' in my shoes.

45:22.637 --> 45:25.682
See, Mr. Gudge,
there's the custodian,
right?

45:25.682 --> 45:27.851
And then there's the man
inside the custodian.

45:29.310 --> 45:31.813
And that's the motherfucker
we got a problem with.

45:31.813 --> 45:34.774
See, 'cause that man,
he got needs, Mr. Gudge,

45:34.774 --> 45:37.778
and normally those needs
gotta do with women
with big asses.

45:37.778 --> 45:40.029
I guess my point
bein' is, uh,

45:40.029 --> 45:42.825
I realize I'm
a bunkie junkie.

45:42.825 --> 45:46.870
But if you would've seen
the kettle drums on this
girl, Mr. Gudge... Ohh.

45:46.870 --> 45:49.581
Well, we're all human.

45:51.249 --> 45:54.544
This apology buys you
a one-week probationary
period.

45:55.796 --> 45:57.172
Thank you, Mr. Gudge.

45:57.172 --> 45:59.507
Stay away from
the customers, MacSam.

45:59.507 --> 46:00.466
(CHUCKLES)

46:00.967 --> 46:02.302
(DRILLING)

46:08.474 --> 46:09.184
(GRUNTS)

46:10.059 --> 46:13.646
This drill bit's
getting awfully hot.

46:13.646 --> 46:16.900
Gawain, maybe you could
fill a Hudson sprayer

46:16.900 --> 46:18.276
and spritz it down
while I drill.

46:19.569 --> 46:21.989
Fuck you. I ain't your
motherfuckin' house nigga.

46:22.780 --> 46:24.616
I'm the inside man.

46:24.616 --> 46:26.492
All right, look,
are you gonna have
a bug up your ass

46:26.492 --> 46:28.077
for the rest of the time
we work together?

46:28.077 --> 46:29.955
I'll get the sprayer.
Oh, no, no. No.

46:31.497 --> 46:32.916
Me and this gentleman here
have to get square.

46:34.250 --> 46:36.836
Let me tell you
somethin', MacSam.

46:36.836 --> 46:39.005
I'm gonna tell you
about how I came down
to Mississippi.

46:39.005 --> 46:40.883
I wasn't born here,
you know.

46:40.883 --> 46:42.133
I'm from Scranton,
Pennsylvania.

46:44.802 --> 46:45.511
What the fuck?

46:48.014 --> 46:50.225
Scranton, Pennsylvania.

46:50.225 --> 46:53.061
Came down here in 1964,
Greyhound bus.

46:53.061 --> 46:54.395
With the Freedom Riders.

46:56.439 --> 46:58.733
Do you know who
the Freedom Riders were,
MacSam?

46:58.733 --> 47:00.986
No, and I don't
give a fuck.

47:00.986 --> 47:02.779
Just tell me when the fuck
they gonna leave, damn.

47:02.779 --> 47:04.739
The Freedom Riders,
my fine young man,

47:04.739 --> 47:07.367
were a group of concerned
liberals from up north,

47:07.367 --> 47:10.954
all working together,
just like we are here.

47:10.954 --> 47:13.623
Involved citizens
who came down here

47:13.623 --> 47:15.959
so that local black folk could
have their civil liberties.

47:17.043 --> 47:18.878
So, that people like you
could have the vote.

47:25.218 --> 47:26.803
You know what, man?

47:26.803 --> 47:27.637
What, brother?

47:29.013 --> 47:30.974
I don't vote.
So, fuck you.

47:30.974 --> 47:33.060
You little fuckin'
ingrate.

47:33.060 --> 47:34.269
And the bus you
rode in on, jackass.

47:34.269 --> 47:35.603
Let's step outside,
MacSam.

47:35.603 --> 47:37.105
Fuck the outside,
come on. What?

47:37.105 --> 47:39.024
(KNOCKING)

47:39.024 --> 47:39.899
(DOOR CREAKING)

47:41.944 --> 47:43.486
My friend
Mrs. Funthes is here,

47:43.486 --> 47:45.571
so I'm about to go out.

47:45.571 --> 47:47.573
Just thought I'd leave y'all
with some cinnamon cookies.

47:48.741 --> 47:49.867
Why, that is lovely.

47:51.912 --> 47:54.957
Ooh, y'all sound good.

47:54.957 --> 47:57.000
Maybe you could come by
the church one Sunday.

47:58.167 --> 48:00.003
Give us a recital.
Why, how kind of you.

48:01.421 --> 48:04.257
Our music, however, is...
Well, how shall I put this?

48:05.883 --> 48:08.469
A bit Roman
in its outlook.

48:08.469 --> 48:10.096
Many of our pieces
were commissioned
by the Holy See.

48:11.014 --> 48:13.391
Oh, I see, all right,

48:13.391 --> 48:15.893
but we don't make
no big whoop-dee-do
about denomination.

48:17.395 --> 48:19.480
Everybody welcome
at our church.

48:19.480 --> 48:21.691
Yeah, we had
a Methodist come in.

48:21.691 --> 48:23.735
Episcopalian.

48:23.735 --> 48:27.697
Back in the '60s,
we had a Jew come in.
(LAUGHS)

48:27.697 --> 48:31.075
Yeah, he had a guitar.
A Jew with a guitar.

48:31.075 --> 48:36.331
Well, if you will excuse me
one moment, madam,
I shall see you out.

48:36.331 --> 48:39.542
If you gentlemen
can labor harmoniously
in the course of my absence,

48:39.542 --> 48:41.502
perhaps upon my return
we shall be prepared
to explode

48:41.502 --> 48:43.130
that vexing old piece
of igneous.

48:45.298 --> 48:49.218
Oh, Professor,
this is Mrs. Funthes.

48:49.218 --> 48:51.179
Enchante,  Mrs. Funthes.
Ravi.

48:52.430 --> 48:55.808
Rosalie, this is Professor
G.H. Dorr, Ph.D.

48:57.018 --> 48:59.980
Oh, my. That's an awful
lot of letters.

48:59.980 --> 49:01.731
(CHUCKLES) Well, now...

49:01.731 --> 49:05.943
Of course, in my youth,
I was known simply
as Goldthwait.

49:05.943 --> 49:07.487
Uh-huh.

49:07.487 --> 49:09.572
All right, safety meeting.

49:09.572 --> 49:12.200
Let's listen up.
General, can you hand
me the primer cord?

49:12.200 --> 49:14.077
Before we set the charge,

49:14.077 --> 49:15.996
we will run through
our procedure.

49:15.996 --> 49:18.081
I have earplugs for
whoever wants them.

49:18.081 --> 49:20.124
Just wedge those
right in your ears.

49:20.124 --> 49:22.043
Now, here we have...
Not yet, Lump.

49:23.044 --> 49:25.047
Now, primer cord.

49:25.047 --> 49:26.173
Gelatinite.

49:26.923 --> 49:28.716
C-4.

49:28.716 --> 49:32.303
Time comes, we pack the hole
in the rock with the C-4

49:32.303 --> 49:36.307
and insert two leads,
A and B.

49:36.307 --> 49:39.268
I remember my father
sayin' to me,

49:39.268 --> 49:42.105
and it's one of the few
memories I retain of the man

49:42.105 --> 49:44.816
from one of his visits home,
and how I do cherish it...

49:44.816 --> 49:47.777
He said to me,
"Goldthwait,

49:47.777 --> 49:50.613
"you are not formed
as other boys."

49:52.448 --> 49:54.283
He a man of learnin'?

49:54.283 --> 49:56.202
This is the same procedure
we will be using

49:56.202 --> 49:57.870
when we collapse
the tunnel

49:57.870 --> 49:59.705
after entering
the casino vault

49:59.705 --> 50:01.833
and returning to
the root cellar.

50:01.833 --> 50:03.459
He was a self-educated man.

50:03.459 --> 50:06.171
Didn't have
a career as such,

50:06.171 --> 50:09.174
but the government did
recognize the breadth
of his readin'

50:09.174 --> 50:13.553
by makin' him librarian
of the state nervous
hospital in Meridian,

50:13.553 --> 50:17.849
where he was
a distinguished inmate.

50:17.849 --> 50:20.101
Once these materials
are combined

50:20.101 --> 50:23.396
only the professionals
may handle them.

50:23.396 --> 50:25.815
That means me
or the General.

50:27.483 --> 50:30.195
Separately they are harmless,
completely inert.

50:30.195 --> 50:33.364
Why, you could light
this stuff on fire,
hit it with a...

50:33.364 --> 50:34.657
(EXPLOSION)

50:36.159 --> 50:36.951
(ALARMS BLARING
IN THE DISTANCE)

50:39.079 --> 50:41.247
What in the name
of heavens was that?

50:43.875 --> 50:46.919
Well, I'm quite certain
there's absolutely
no reason to be alarmed.

50:48.129 --> 50:50.131
Why, I'm not even
absolutely certain

50:50.131 --> 50:52.008
I heard anything
at all.

50:52.008 --> 50:53.092
Didn't hear nothin'?

50:54.136 --> 50:56.762
Well, something perhaps.

50:56.762 --> 51:00.850
Nothing that need
discompose us was the sense
I was tryin' to convey.

51:00.850 --> 51:03.270
Now, Mrs. Munson,
I will not have you missin'
your musical recital.

51:03.270 --> 51:04.770
Off you go.

51:04.770 --> 51:08.107
I shall call the gas company,
or the water company.

51:08.107 --> 51:12.737
Whatever subterranean utility
is implicated in this
contretemps.

51:12.737 --> 51:14.614
I shall see
to the matter,

51:14.614 --> 51:17.700
as only a highly educated
classicist could.

51:26.709 --> 51:29.170
Blood. Blood,
Professor, blood.

51:29.170 --> 51:32.089
Blood, blood, blood.
(YELLING INDISTNCTLY)

51:32.089 --> 51:34.675
PANCAKE: It's nothin'
to make a fuss about.
It's perfectly all right.

51:34.675 --> 51:37.428
Jackass, you better get
yo' ass back down there
and find that shit, dipshit.

51:37.428 --> 51:40.097
Really, I'm perfectly
all right.
Perfectly all right?

51:40.097 --> 51:42.892
Jackass, you just blew
your goddamn finger off.

51:42.892 --> 51:45.061
The motherfucker's down there
flappin' the fuck around.

51:45.061 --> 51:47.146
You better get yo' ass
back down there and find it.

51:47.146 --> 51:48.689
I'm tellin' you
right now, nubbie,

51:48.689 --> 51:49.857
I ain't pickin' up your
goddamn finger.

51:49.857 --> 51:51.776
I gather there was
a premature detonation.

51:51.776 --> 51:53.236
Would you tell
this motherfucker

51:53.236 --> 51:54.779
he can sew this
shit back on?

51:54.779 --> 51:57.114
It's like that dude whose
wife cut his dick off,
threw it on the freeway?

51:57.114 --> 51:58.741
She just called AAA,

51:58.741 --> 52:01.203
they towed the dick
and sewed the motherfucker
back on.

52:01.203 --> 52:03.788
Listen up. Jackass,
I saw the motherfucker
in a porno.

52:03.788 --> 52:04.914
The thang still worked.
(MUMBLING)

52:04.914 --> 52:06.249
It looked like
a chewed-up frank,

52:06.249 --> 52:08.584
but that little motherfucker
be workin' that motherfucker.

52:08.584 --> 52:11.837
It's mangly, but he be fuckin'
the bitch all kind of ways
with a twisted dick.

52:11.837 --> 52:13.714
Oh, your fuckin'
finger just moved.

52:13.714 --> 52:15.342
The motherfucker
movin' slow now.

52:15.342 --> 52:16.717
I'm not gettin' that shit.
Fuck that.

52:16.717 --> 52:19.095
You're on your own there.

52:19.095 --> 52:23.057
They usin' the house
to practice music
of the Rococo.

52:23.724 --> 52:24.976
Mmm-hmm.

52:26.811 --> 52:30.439
I propose we get our fallen
comrade to the hospital.

52:30.439 --> 52:33.901
The General will follow
when he manages to recover
the severed digit.

52:33.901 --> 52:36.487
PANCAKE: No, no, really,
I'm perfectly all right.

52:36.487 --> 52:37.697
I don't know what
all the fuss is about.

52:38.948 --> 52:43.369
Good news. Good news.
Pickles. Go catch him.

52:43.369 --> 52:45.496
The house is in
apple-pie order,

52:45.496 --> 52:48.791
though we do have to get
medical attention
for Mr. Pancake,

52:48.791 --> 52:52.379
who, durin' the disturbance,
pinched his finger
in the valve of his sackbut.

52:52.379 --> 52:55.172
You let the cat out.

52:55.172 --> 52:59.386
The General is even now
exercisin' every effort
in retrievin'

52:59.386 --> 53:01.596
your mischievous little
Pickles. Please, go on.

53:01.596 --> 53:03.431
Go on and enjoy
the concert.

53:03.431 --> 53:04.807
Driver.
Au revoir, mes dames!

53:18.821 --> 53:21.866
DORR:  Despite our setback,
we find ourselves on schedule

53:21.866 --> 53:24.952
to penetrate the vault here
this afternoon,

53:24.952 --> 53:26.996
while Mrs. Munson
is at church,

53:26.996 --> 53:28.914
havin' blasted that little
old rock to pieces

53:28.914 --> 53:31.208
durin' Mrs. Munson's
choir practice.

53:31.208 --> 53:32.793
Garth, can you run us
through the game plan

53:32.793 --> 53:35.129
for what remains
of our tunnel?

53:35.129 --> 53:37.882
Of course. Why,
it's child's play now.

53:37.882 --> 53:39.925
Easiest thing
in the world.

53:39.925 --> 53:43.262
Only a couple of feet
separate us from the vault.

53:43.262 --> 53:46.265
Just the usual spadework
until we get to the masonry
of the vault,

53:46.265 --> 53:48.267
and then we just
drill through.

53:48.267 --> 53:52.938
And will you be able to
wield the drill with your
maimed extremity?

53:52.938 --> 53:54.690
Oh, well, yeah,
I should think so.

53:54.690 --> 53:56.776
Yeah, it's only
one finger.

53:56.776 --> 53:59.570
Inhibits me in doing
finer work of course.

53:59.570 --> 54:01.697
I'll always have to
live with that.

54:02.990 --> 54:04.326
(CLEARS THROAT)

54:04.326 --> 54:06.661
Maybe, um, I'm just
thinkin' out loud here.

54:06.661 --> 54:09.455
Maybe, since as you say,
there will be problems later.

54:11.123 --> 54:13.460
Maybe... And I actually
mentioned this
to Mountain Girl,

54:13.460 --> 54:14.585
she agrees with me,

54:14.585 --> 54:16.796
so, it's not just one
person's opinion.

54:17.546 --> 54:19.256
Maybe, uh...

54:19.256 --> 54:23.052
I should get a little extra
compensation for the accident.

54:28.474 --> 54:29.600
Somewhat larger share.

54:33.437 --> 54:36.190
Why, if this was any
other line of work,
I'd be getting workman's comp.

54:36.190 --> 54:37.441
Wouldn't I?

54:37.441 --> 54:38.859
Might even have
a pretty good lawsuit.

54:38.859 --> 54:41.070
Wait, so you gonna
sue yourself

54:41.070 --> 54:42.822
for blowing your own
goddamn finger off?

54:42.822 --> 54:44.407
Well, now that is
simply asinine.

54:44.407 --> 54:45.700
Yes, but you see, Garth,

54:45.700 --> 54:47.368
this is not what
you just called

54:47.368 --> 54:49.829
"some other line of work."

54:49.829 --> 54:51.414
Yeah, no, no, no,
but if it were...

54:51.414 --> 54:53.416
This is a criminal enterprise,
not to put too
fine a point on it,

54:53.416 --> 54:56.377
entailing any manner of risk
not involved in honest labor.

54:56.377 --> 54:58.338
Governmental regulations
and civic safeguards

54:58.338 --> 55:02.509
cannot be assumed to apply
to antisocial pursuits.

55:02.509 --> 55:04.386
Yeah, but he lost
his finger.

55:04.386 --> 55:06.429
We don't give a fuck.

55:06.429 --> 55:07.972
That fool could blow his
goddamn dick off,

55:07.972 --> 55:10.099
it don't make no
never mind to us.

55:10.099 --> 55:12.852
We not payin' this jackass
for goin' around blowin' off
goddamn body parts.

55:12.852 --> 55:14.770

out yo' ass, man.

55:14.770 --> 55:16.105

there is no call for...

55:16.105 --> 55:17.606
No extra share.

55:21.402 --> 55:22.862
Okay. Majority rules.

55:24.905 --> 55:26.741
Like I say, it was
just a trial balloon.

55:26.741 --> 55:28.409

so bad, really.

55:28.409 --> 55:30.202

matter is settled,

55:37.710 --> 55:41.046
why don't we synchronize
our watches before
Gawain reports to work.

55:41.046 --> 55:43.382

it will be exactly 12:16.

Thank you for being
so understanding.

58:58.911 --> 59:02.624
Not everyone is, of course,
which is why the biggest
challenge of IBS

59:02.624 --> 59:03.582
is educating the public.

59:04.750 --> 59:06.585
Afflicts over two
million people,

59:06.585 --> 59:08.045
yet most of us have
never heard of it.

59:09.463 --> 59:12.800
And it strikes without regard
to age, gender or race.

59:12.800 --> 59:15.094
Fuck, man,
I don't wanna hear
about this shit.

59:15.094 --> 59:17.680

the kind of attitude
we're fighting.

that's how Mountain Girl
and I met.

59:26.647 --> 59:29.400
with the demise
of the Borscht Belt,

59:29.400 --> 59:33.028
so they have
various promotions,
mixers, so on.

59:33.028 --> 59:38.785
This was a weekend
for Irritable Bowel singles
to meet, support each other,

59:38.785 --> 59:40.160
share stories.

59:40.160 --> 59:42.079
I don't want to hear
a single one of them
stories, okay?

59:42.079 --> 59:44.581
Now, some of them
are very moving.
Not one fucking story.

59:44.581 --> 59:46.917

to have IBS.

59:46.917 --> 59:49.628

well, with wit and grit
and no small amount
of courage,

01:01:19.843 --> 01:01:22.513
we accomplished something
on that day.

01:01:24.640 --> 01:01:28.227
A feat of derring-do,
an enterprise not ignoble.

Desperate men,
Mrs. Munson.

01:11:37.168 --> 01:11:38.504
We have

01:11:40.547 --> 01:11:45.093
tunneled into the nearby
offices of the  Bandit Queen
gambling emporium

01:11:45.093 --> 01:11:47.595
and relieved it
of its treasure.

01:11:47.595 --> 01:11:49.305
Lord have mercy.

01:11:49.305 --> 01:11:50.557
It is true.

01:11:50.557 --> 01:11:53.768
The  Bandit Queen
is a den of iniquity.

01:11:53.768 --> 01:11:56.604
A painted harlot
luring people into sin

01:11:56.604 --> 01:11:58.356
by exciting
the vice of greed

01:11:58.356 --> 01:12:01.067
with her promise of
easy winnings. Oh, yes.

01:12:01.067 --> 01:12:03.445
Her gains are
ill-gotten.

01:12:04.571 --> 01:12:07.533
But I offer no excuses.

01:12:09.368 --> 01:12:10.326
Save one.

01:12:12.328 --> 01:12:14.414
We men have each pledged

01:12:14.414 --> 01:12:16.666
one half of our share
of the booty

01:12:16.666 --> 01:12:19.127
to a charitable
institution.

01:12:19.127 --> 01:12:21.004
In compensation for
the use of your home,

01:12:21.004 --> 01:12:24.924
we had planned to
donate a full share

01:12:24.924 --> 01:12:28.553
to Bob Jones University.

01:12:28.553 --> 01:12:31.264
Without burdening you
with guilty knowledge
by informing you of same.

01:12:33.392 --> 01:12:35.143
But now you have wrested
the information from me.

01:12:35.143 --> 01:12:36.519
(LAUGHS)

01:12:36.519 --> 01:12:38.062
There you have it.

01:12:38.062 --> 01:12:39.731
It is on your table,
Mrs. Munson.

01:12:40.356 --> 01:12:41.858
"The awful truth."

01:12:43.443 --> 01:12:45.446
Stolen money.

01:12:45.446 --> 01:12:47.363
But find the victim,
Mrs. Munson.

01:12:48.698 --> 01:12:50.366
I challenge you.

01:12:50.366 --> 01:12:53.077
Even the casino itself,
that riparian Gomorrah,

01:12:53.077 --> 01:12:54.913
shall suffer no harm.

01:12:54.913 --> 01:12:58.708
It has an insurance
company.

01:12:58.708 --> 01:13:02.796
A financial behemoth that
will cheerfully replenish
its depleted vaults.

01:13:03.671 --> 01:13:05.590
That is its function.

01:13:05.590 --> 01:13:10.845
And that insurance company
has tens and tens of
thousands of policyholders.

01:13:10.845 --> 01:13:12.972
So that we have done
the calculations,
Mrs. Munson.

01:13:12.972 --> 01:13:14.599
So that at
the end of the day,

01:13:14.599 --> 01:13:16.392
at the final reckoning,

01:13:16.392 --> 01:13:21.898
each and every one of those
policyholders shall have
contributed one penny,

01:13:21.898 --> 01:13:24.067
one, single,
solitary cent,

01:13:25.485 --> 01:13:27.613
to the satisfaction
of this claim.

01:13:27.946 --> 01:13:29.572
One penny?

01:13:29.572 --> 01:13:32.951
One penny.
Think of it, Mrs. Munson.

01:13:32.951 --> 01:13:37.372
One penny from those
thousands upon thousands
of people

01:13:37.372 --> 01:13:41.709
so that Bob Jones University
can continue on its mission.

01:13:43.753 --> 01:13:46.464
Why, I have no doubt that,
were those policy holders
made aware

01:13:46.464 --> 01:13:48.383
of the existence of that
august institution.

01:13:48.383 --> 01:13:50.301
Each and every one of them

01:13:50.301 --> 01:13:53.680
would have volunteered
some token amount for
the furtherance of its aims.

01:13:54.806 --> 01:13:56.391
Well, that's probably true.

01:13:56.391 --> 01:13:58.643
Sadly,

01:13:58.643 --> 01:14:03.565
the criminal stain
is upon my soul.

01:14:03.565 --> 01:14:08.612
But the benefit
shall accrue to any
number of worthy causes

01:14:08.612 --> 01:14:11.614
as long, that is,
as the secret stays with us.

01:14:15.618 --> 01:14:16.744
Well,

01:14:19.163 --> 01:14:20.915
I can't hardly see
the harm in it.

01:14:23.668 --> 01:14:25.587
One penny?
(MOUTHING) One penny.

01:14:37.932 --> 01:14:40.143
I'm sorry.
Excuse me?

01:14:40.143 --> 01:14:42.103
No, I'm sorry,
it's wrong,

01:14:42.103 --> 01:14:43.897
and don't you be leadin'
me into temptation.

01:14:43.897 --> 01:14:45.356
No, no, madam,
I must strenuously...

01:14:45.356 --> 01:14:46.900
I'm sorry,
it's just plain wrong.

01:14:46.900 --> 01:14:48.484
Stealin'.
No, madam...

01:14:48.484 --> 01:14:51.195
I know your intentions
was good.
No, they weren't.

01:14:51.195 --> 01:14:53.865
And I won't call the police
if you give back the money

01:14:53.865 --> 01:14:55.366
and y'all go to church
with me next Sunday.

01:14:56.659 --> 01:14:57.952
And engage in
divine worship?

01:15:00.788 --> 01:15:02.373
I've made up my mind.

01:15:04.083 --> 01:15:06.502
Now, you can doubletalk
all you want.

01:15:06.502 --> 01:15:07.713
It's church or
the county jail.

01:15:08.796 --> 01:15:11.799
Think it over.
I gotta feed the cat.

01:15:22.393 --> 01:15:23.770
(STRUMMING)

01:15:30.610 --> 01:15:34.280
Motherfuck.
DORR: Yes.

01:15:34.280 --> 01:15:37.909
Unfortunately,
Mrs. Munson has rather
complicated the situation.

01:15:37.909 --> 01:15:40.161
Yeah, well, I know how to
de-complicate it.

01:15:40.161 --> 01:15:41.996
You bust a cap in that
old bitch's head,
everything be simple.

01:15:47.628 --> 01:15:48.670
Not easy to do.

01:15:50.463 --> 01:15:52.340
Many reasons.

01:15:52.340 --> 01:15:54.884
Practical ones,
quiet neighborhood,
sleepy town.

01:15:56.344 --> 01:15:59.430
Reasons of moral repugnance,
a harmless woman,

01:15:59.430 --> 01:16:02.016
a deed conceived and
executed in cold blood.

01:16:02.016 --> 01:16:04.352
No, Gawain, would that
it were simple.

01:16:05.436 --> 01:16:07.230
Well, fuck, man.
What we gonna do?

01:16:07.230 --> 01:16:08.649
Give the money back
and go to church?

01:16:08.649 --> 01:16:09.733
(STRUMS)

01:16:10.609 --> 01:16:12.360
I shudder. I quake.

01:16:14.696 --> 01:16:17.240
You, sir,
are a Buddhist.

01:16:17.240 --> 01:16:19.158
Is there not
a "middle" way?

01:16:25.331 --> 01:16:27.083
Must float like a leaf
on the river of life

01:16:30.461 --> 01:16:31.587
and kill old lady.

01:16:35.216 --> 01:16:39.137
Yes, yes, I suppose
you are right.

01:16:39.137 --> 01:16:42.724
It is the active nature
of the crime, though,
that so abhors.

01:16:42.724 --> 01:16:44.434
The squeezing of the trigger,
the plunging of the knife.

01:16:47.687 --> 01:16:49.105
But let us
think a moment.

01:16:50.816 --> 01:16:52.233
What other tools
do we have at hand?

01:16:53.776 --> 01:16:54.944
We have the cellar.

01:16:55.945 --> 01:16:58.406
We have the cavity.

01:16:58.406 --> 01:17:00.491
We have masonry
and trowel.

01:17:02.952 --> 01:17:07.832
Perhaps we could
simply immure her.

01:17:09.125 --> 01:17:10.710
Sure, easiest thing
in the world.

01:17:10.710 --> 01:17:13.296
I can whip up a little
mortar in a snow saucer.

01:17:13.296 --> 01:17:15.631
Lay the bricks.
Anchor in some chains.

01:17:15.631 --> 01:17:17.842
(SNORTS) Mountain Girl
could outsource the manacles.

01:17:17.842 --> 01:17:19.844
Oh, gentlemen, gentlemen,
we delude ourselves.

01:17:21.220 --> 01:17:24.808
No, shortest and
painless is best.

01:17:26.059 --> 01:17:31.314
Gawain's gun, retort muffled
by a pillow, into the brain.

01:17:32.523 --> 01:17:33.649
(CLAPS) The affair
of an instant.

01:17:34.901 --> 01:17:36.235
The only question is,

01:17:37.361 --> 01:17:38.946
who wields the weapon?

01:17:41.282 --> 01:17:43.659
I believe it is traditional
in such circumstances

01:17:43.659 --> 01:17:44.827
to draw straws.

01:17:45.745 --> 01:17:47.830
Fair enough.
Here you go, Lump.

01:17:50.333 --> 01:17:54.420
I'm thinkin', though,
that since I lost a finger,

01:17:54.420 --> 01:17:56.339
I mean, literally lost it,
'cause of that fuckin' cat,

01:17:58.299 --> 01:17:59.550
maybe I should be
excused from this thing.

01:18:01.803 --> 01:18:03.889
Hard for me to squeeze
a trigger anyway.

01:18:03.889 --> 01:18:05.849
You one whiny
motherfucker.

01:18:05.849 --> 01:18:08.267
I'll come over there and
squeeze your fuckin' nutsack,

01:18:08.267 --> 01:18:10.812
you keep that bullshit up.
Shut up, punk.

01:18:10.812 --> 01:18:12.898
I'll kick your goddamn ass,
sweet-legs.
Gentlemen.

No special pleading.
No exceptions.

01:18:15.817 --> 01:18:18.152
It is of the nature
of the situation we would
all prefer to be excused.

01:18:19.695 --> 01:18:21.823
Well, okay, it was
just a trial balloon.

01:18:49.809 --> 01:18:51.102

nothin', punk.

I have outlined your
position with my colleagues,

01:24:03.414 --> 01:24:07.251
and I now return to you to
render our collective verdict.
Uh-huh?

01:24:07.251 --> 01:24:09.628
There was much
spirited discussion

01:24:09.628 --> 01:24:13.340
and an atmosphere of
frank give-and-take.

01:24:13.340 --> 01:24:15.926
Some of our number
were initially appalled
at your proposal

01:24:15.926 --> 01:24:18.095
that we simply
return the money,
some were more receptive.

01:24:18.095 --> 01:24:21.056
I don't care if they
was receptive or not.

01:24:21.056 --> 01:24:23.809
And that attitude, madam,
was a factor in our
discussions.

01:24:23.809 --> 01:24:25.478
To a man, I must say

01:24:25.478 --> 01:24:28.189
they were devastated
at the prospect

01:24:28.189 --> 01:24:30.441
of not being able
to contribute to their
respective charities.

01:24:30.441 --> 01:24:33.027
Well, that is a shame.
Indeed.

01:24:33.027 --> 01:24:37.157
But at the end of the day,
your position prevailed.

01:24:37.157 --> 01:24:40.659
So, we have decided
to return the money,
every last cent of it,

01:24:40.659 --> 01:24:43.163
and attend Sunday services,

01:24:43.163 --> 01:24:45.039
