01:16.363 --> 01:20.231
Well, this is exciting.
My first bust on a glacier.

01:20.233 --> 01:23.668
Uh, hey, Dad, should I have
my crown on for this?

01:23.670 --> 01:25.637
I'm on it.

01:27.407 --> 01:29.774
Don't worry, he'll be fine.

01:29.776 --> 01:34.111
Try more royal, Norm!

01:34.113 --> 01:37.315
Hey, thanks, Socrates.
You're a real prince.

01:37.317 --> 01:39.084
Forgot where
I left my crown.

01:39.086 --> 01:40.751
Think it was at
the walrus convention.

01:40.753 --> 01:42.821
It was by the hot tub.

01:42.823 --> 01:46.026
And I'm not a prince.
I'm a duke.

01:50.695 --> 01:54.497
If the crown doesn't fit,
maybe I should quit.

01:57.403 --> 02:00.536
More royal, eh? Uh, uh...

02:00.538 --> 02:05.408
How's this?
King in action! Check me out.

02:05.410 --> 02:07.811
Smooth move, buddy.

02:07.813 --> 02:10.482
Uh-huh, uh, pensive king.

02:14.319 --> 02:15.651
How's this?

02:15.653 --> 02:18.788
Whoa! Look out!

02:18.790 --> 02:20.455
Whoa!

02:20.457 --> 02:23.227
Doh! Ding! Please... Some...

02:26.164 --> 02:27.697
What? Huh?

02:30.568 --> 02:33.635
Could you call
an osteopath?! Oh!

02:35.672 --> 02:37.739
Go, Quinn, go!

02:37.741 --> 02:41.476
Go, Quinn, go! Go, Quinn, go!

02:41.478 --> 02:43.745
Listen up, guys.
You know, I'm Quinn.

02:43.747 --> 02:46.815
This is my bro Chase,
and my kid sister, Maria.

02:46.817 --> 02:51.652
Our dad is gonna be named king
today, which makes me a prince.

02:51.654 --> 02:53.621
But most importantly,

02:53.623 --> 02:56.791
it means you guys need to treat
King Norm with some respect.

02:56.793 --> 02:58.759
He's not some goof ball...

02:58.761 --> 03:00.629
- sliding around on the ice.
- Slow down!

03:03.832 --> 03:05.102
Yow!

03:08.336 --> 03:09.602
Ow!

03:09.604 --> 03:11.371
Oh, my back.

03:11.373 --> 03:13.473
- You all right, Dad?
- I'm good!

03:13.475 --> 03:15.241
Never better, kids.

03:20.749 --> 03:22.183
Sorry, Reuben.

03:25.287 --> 03:27.786
Wassup, dudes, dudettes?

03:27.788 --> 03:31.657
Ahh!

03:31.659 --> 03:33.561
Agh.

03:40.467 --> 03:44.837
Not just yet, kids. The ceremony
is at Pride Ice in a couple of hours.

03:44.839 --> 03:48.543
Tell your friends free snow
cones for everybody, big party.

03:50.610 --> 03:52.611
See? This isn't so hard.

03:57.317 --> 03:58.649
Afternoon, boys!

03:58.651 --> 04:00.652
Mickey, no cheating, eh?

04:00.654 --> 04:03.755
Lord knows where you
hide that extra ace!

04:03.757 --> 04:05.724
That's gonna be
King of the Arctic?

04:05.726 --> 04:09.393
I got
more royalty in my cards.

04:09.395 --> 04:10.928
I mean, look, a Dodo bird!

04:10.930 --> 04:12.597
Hmm?

04:12.599 --> 04:14.765
How long you think
his reign will last?

04:14.767 --> 04:16.899
30 seconds, tops.

04:16.902 --> 04:20.769
He's gonna take one step onto Pride
Ice and fall on his furry butt.

04:20.772 --> 04:23.640
No, but dude, come on,
he's nice!

04:23.642 --> 04:26.443
Yeah, nice to laugh at!

04:26.445 --> 04:28.779
Guys, I'm right here.

04:43.694 --> 04:48.598
Ladies, gentlemen, and caribou,
this is a great moment.

04:48.600 --> 04:52.502
For the first time,
we officially recognize

04:52.504 --> 04:57.406
the ascendency of a new
King of the Arctic. Norm!

04:57.408 --> 05:00.744
Yay! Love you, Norm.

05:06.683 --> 05:09.450
It is Polar custom to...

05:14.392 --> 05:16.792
Can you please
turn off your phone!

05:16.794 --> 05:18.660
Sheesh.
Have some respect!

05:18.662 --> 05:20.962
Although, whoever's phone
that is has good taste.

05:20.964 --> 05:23.930
That song rocks.
I got the same ringtone.

05:23.932 --> 05:28.635
Oh, rats, that's
my phone, isn't it!

05:30.706 --> 05:33.007
Uh, just a sec.
I gotta take this.

05:34.377 --> 05:36.678
- Phone?
- Classic Norm.

05:36.680 --> 05:42.483
Olympia, what's up, girl!
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

05:42.485 --> 05:46.654
What? No. No, you didn't!

05:46.656 --> 05:49.021
Olympia just solved
a crossword blindfolded!

05:49.023 --> 05:52.628
Do you have to talk
to her about it now?

05:54.029 --> 05:55.895
No, no, I guess not.
Hold on.

05:55.897 --> 05:58.331
I'm kinda in the middle
of something here, Olympia.

05:58.333 --> 06:00.066
Everyone's giving
me weird looks.

06:00.068 --> 06:03.737
Wait! The reason I'm calling is
because I have huge news.

06:03.739 --> 06:05.338
You ready?

06:05.340 --> 06:07.941
Okay, hold on,
I'll put you on speaker.

06:07.943 --> 06:11.378
Everyone, my friend
Olympia is on the line.

06:11.380 --> 06:12.978
She's got big news!

06:12.980 --> 06:14.880
<i>We just heard
from the mayor.</i>

06:14.882 --> 06:17.382
<i>Norm, you're getting
the Key to New York City!</i>

06:17.384 --> 06:19.051
Who, me?

06:19.053 --> 06:22.520
Yes, you!
You're the King of the Arctic!

06:22.522 --> 06:24.823
It's the highest honor
a dignitary can have.

06:24.825 --> 06:26.692
And since you can talk...

06:26.694 --> 06:28.827
they want to bring you
down here again for a ceremony!

06:28.829 --> 06:32.063
<i>I'm so excited to see you
again! Talk to you soon!</i>

06:32.065 --> 06:36.867
Hey, everyone, my first order
of business as your king...

06:36.869 --> 06:39.403
is to go back
to New York City!

06:39.405 --> 06:41.506
Huh? Yay!

06:41.508 --> 06:43.644
Bad idea, dude!

06:45.145 --> 06:48.480
Don't listen to him, Norm.
This is a good idea.

06:48.482 --> 06:52.617
You can prove to the humans...
<i>and</i> the animals...

06:52.619 --> 06:55.823
that you are a great
and true king.

07:09.834 --> 07:13.035
Mom, I think you should
tell Dad to stay here.

07:13.037 --> 07:15.138
He's got no business
going to New York.

07:15.140 --> 07:16.907
What do you mean, honey?

07:16.909 --> 07:18.775
I'm worried about him.

07:18.777 --> 07:21.078
Is he my dad? Yes.

07:21.080 --> 07:23.414
Do I love him? Yes.

07:23.416 --> 07:27.082
But do I think he'll go to New
York without embarrassing himself?

07:27.084 --> 07:28.584
No.

07:28.586 --> 07:30.586
Don't underestimate
your father.

07:30.588 --> 07:33.523
He's done this once before,
and he can do it again.

07:33.525 --> 07:35.725
He's the King of the Arctic,
after all.

07:35.727 --> 07:37.593
He's just not like us.

07:37.595 --> 07:40.529
He's too human,
and I'm worried that he's

07:40.531 --> 07:42.697
not the type of king
that they're expecting.

07:42.699 --> 07:45.101
They're expecting that!

07:45.103 --> 07:47.768
That! Or That!

07:47.770 --> 07:49.573
But not that.

07:52.809 --> 07:53.977
Oh...

08:08.224 --> 08:09.890
Bye, honey.

08:09.892 --> 08:11.926
Hey, don't fight
with your sister.

08:11.928 --> 08:14.995
Hey, Quinn, I was thinking
that as the oldest,

08:14.997 --> 08:17.731
you'd like to see The Big Apple,
too. Whadd'ya say?

08:17.733 --> 08:19.567
You want me
to come with you?

08:19.569 --> 08:22.168
Sure do. Next time maybe
Maria or Chase'll come,

08:22.170 --> 08:25.705
but for now, I figure we
need some one-on-one time.

08:25.707 --> 08:27.041
It'll be fun.

08:27.043 --> 08:28.676
Awesome!

08:31.214 --> 08:35.148
All right, little guys, you stay here
and hold down the fort while I'm gone.

08:38.653 --> 08:41.554
No! I don't want to hear it!
I'm gonna have my hands full

08:41.556 --> 08:43.155
without you little fur balls
running around.

08:43.157 --> 08:45.494
I'll see you when I get back.

08:48.562 --> 08:50.697
Love you! 'Cept you, Mickey.

08:50.699 --> 08:52.030
We'll be back soon!

08:52.032 --> 08:53.532
Peace out, Arctic!

08:53.534 --> 08:55.968
Don't let your meat loaf!

08:55.970 --> 08:59.605
All right, well, we're going
to the city that never sleeps,

08:59.607 --> 09:01.973
so maybe we should
get some shut eye.

09:01.975 --> 09:03.775
Got a long ride
ahead of us.

09:03.777 --> 09:06.613
Don't be nervous.
You got this.

09:17.624 --> 09:19.223
What the...

09:19.225 --> 09:20.992
Oh, you guys!

09:20.994 --> 09:23.261
- Tah-dah!
- I said you can't come!

09:23.263 --> 09:24.861
- Oh.
- But no, you don't care.

09:24.863 --> 09:26.797
You just want a free ride
to New York.

09:26.799 --> 09:29.966
You want to pee in the subway,
like everyone else!

09:29.968 --> 09:32.205
Really? You came
to support me?

09:33.872 --> 09:35.673
Of course, Dad.
They love you.

09:35.675 --> 09:37.774
It's okay,
I'll look after you.

09:37.776 --> 09:39.612
Come on, guys.

10:02.167 --> 10:05.505
Oh!

10:06.237 --> 10:08.238
Vera! Olympia!

10:08.240 --> 10:10.673
Oh, I missed you guys!

10:10.675 --> 10:13.608
Come here! Lemme give you
a proper bear hug!

10:17.114 --> 10:20.949
I missed you, too, Norm,
but can you let us go?

10:20.951 --> 10:23.719
Hard to breathe
in all this fur.

10:23.721 --> 10:26.689
There she is,
my little Einstein!

10:26.691 --> 10:29.858
The smartest girl
in the whole wide world.

10:29.860 --> 10:31.794
And you must be Quinn!

10:31.796 --> 10:33.929
Yes, yes.
Where are my manners?

10:33.931 --> 10:35.996
Guys, this is my son, Quinn.

10:35.998 --> 10:37.799
Quinn, this is Olympia.

10:37.801 --> 10:40.801
She eats rocket scientists
for breakfast.

10:40.803 --> 10:42.370
And this right here
is Vera.

10:42.372 --> 10:44.771
She took good care of me
last time I was here.

10:44.773 --> 10:46.306
Well, I'm impressed, Pop.

10:46.308 --> 10:48.742
It seems like you have
some good friends here.

10:48.744 --> 10:50.277
Uh...

10:50.279 --> 10:53.014
- What?
- Quinn speaks human, too?

10:53.016 --> 10:54.281
He does!

10:54.283 --> 10:56.184
- I do?
- Yes! You do!

10:56.186 --> 10:57.555
He does?

10:58.388 --> 11:00.156
Oh, yeah, he does.

11:11.300 --> 11:14.635
Oh, just a sec. I can't...

11:14.637 --> 11:16.770
Uh, ah! Okay, good, good.

11:16.772 --> 11:18.174
Good! Got it!

11:20.309 --> 11:22.978
Whoa, this place rocks!

11:25.045 --> 11:27.114
And you haven't even
seen the best part.

11:30.651 --> 11:32.350
We got it all for you guys.

11:32.352 --> 11:35.187
Alaskan king crab, salmon,
dried seaweed...

11:35.189 --> 11:38.957
This is the prettiest sight
these eyes have ever seen!

11:38.959 --> 11:40.595
Mmm!

11:41.963 --> 11:43.828
The next thing I know,

11:43.830 --> 11:46.731
I'm sliding on my butt
for the whole Arctic to see!

11:46.733 --> 11:48.101
No way!

11:59.111 --> 12:01.779
I just want to make sure
I'm actually king material.

12:01.781 --> 12:03.782
I've got the entire
Arctic counting on me,

12:03.784 --> 12:06.850
and I'm not as graceful
as my grandpa, you know?

12:06.852 --> 12:08.719
Ooh!

12:08.721 --> 12:10.055
I see your point,

12:10.057 --> 12:12.256
but you just need
to be yourself.

12:12.258 --> 12:15.693
You're a great king because
you're not totally perfect.

12:15.695 --> 12:19.228
You're just you.
And people like you.

12:22.701 --> 12:24.200
Speaking of people
liking you,

12:24.202 --> 12:26.302
you are doing such
a great job with Olympia.

12:26.304 --> 12:28.738
She and Quinn sure seem
to be hittin' it off.

12:28.740 --> 12:31.709
Hey, here, let's get a picture of the
kids sleepin' on the couch together!

12:31.711 --> 12:33.276
I'll get my phone.

12:33.278 --> 12:36.080
Son of a seal!
I left my phone up north!

12:37.782 --> 12:39.915
I don't know
about this, Maria.

12:39.917 --> 12:42.852
Dad'll kill us if he finds out
we were playing with his phone.

12:42.854 --> 12:44.820
Oh, relax.

12:44.822 --> 12:47.890
I just want to see if we can
live stream Dad's key ceremony.

12:47.892 --> 12:49.925
I'm nervous
he's gonna mess it up!

12:49.927 --> 12:52.194
Well, let's try
to track him.

12:52.196 --> 12:53.996
No, lemme see.

12:53.998 --> 12:56.098
We can try and triangulate
his coordinates...

12:56.100 --> 12:59.234
by using a combination of a
peer-to-peer traffic system...

12:59.236 --> 13:02.370
and the City of New York's own
proprietary mapping algorithms.

13:02.372 --> 13:04.905
Excuse me.
Nerd alert.

13:04.907 --> 13:06.843
Got it!

13:08.078 --> 13:11.045
It's really small.

13:11.047 --> 13:13.116
I have an idea!

13:27.195 --> 13:29.797
Man, if bears
could sweat...

13:29.799 --> 13:32.767
that's what I'd be
doing now. Sweating.

13:32.769 --> 13:33.834
Ooh.

13:38.841 --> 13:41.211
Whoa!

13:49.216 --> 13:51.017
Oh, sorry,
sensitive nose.

13:51.019 --> 13:53.322
Oh, that's gonna stain.

13:59.394 --> 14:00.730
Yeah!

14:03.899 --> 14:05.831
- Kids?
- Oh.

14:05.833 --> 14:07.834
What is going on here?

14:07.836 --> 14:09.936
Why do you have
Norm's phone?

14:09.938 --> 14:12.805
Uh... It was Maria!
Maria had the phone!

14:12.807 --> 14:15.907
She made me help her! She's out
of control, I swear! Help me!

14:15.909 --> 14:18.075
Thanks a lot, narc!

14:18.077 --> 14:19.978
I'm disappointed
in both of you.

14:19.980 --> 14:22.446
Your father would not be happy
to see that you did this.

14:22.448 --> 14:27.452
But Mom, we only did it so we
could watch him and cheer him on.

14:27.454 --> 14:31.556
We're nervous for Dad,
and we want him to be okay.

14:31.558 --> 14:33.025
Is this true?

14:33.027 --> 14:34.392
Yeah!

14:36.229 --> 14:37.995
Mickey? You too?

14:37.997 --> 14:40.131
Eh, sorta.

14:40.133 --> 14:43.201
I bet my antlers he falls flat on
his face walking up the stairs.

14:43.203 --> 14:44.538
Oh...

14:48.141 --> 14:49.243
Hey.

14:51.344 --> 14:53.243
Good afternoon.

14:56.114 --> 14:59.786
Today is a great day.

15:02.554 --> 15:06.356
First off, I'd like
to thank our great sponsors,

15:06.358 --> 15:09.159
Far North Water,
the purest water there is.

15:09.161 --> 15:10.927
"Water from so far north,

15:10.929 --> 15:13.399
it might as well
be from heaven."

15:14.565 --> 15:16.035
Ahh!

15:18.203 --> 15:21.605
As the leader of the greatest
human city on Earth,

15:21.607 --> 15:24.239
it only makes sense
that I would present to you

15:24.241 --> 15:26.642
someone of similar stature.

15:26.644 --> 15:31.212
I would like to introduce an
individual of great honesty,

15:31.214 --> 15:34.984
of great courage,
a respected dignitary,

15:34.986 --> 15:36.985
the King of the Arctic!

15:36.987 --> 15:41.990
Folks, you already know him
as Norm of the North!

15:43.227 --> 15:45.527
You got this, Norm.

15:45.529 --> 15:46.564
Huh.

15:51.000 --> 15:53.434
You must be
related to Norm!

15:53.436 --> 15:55.369
Yep. That's my dad.

15:55.371 --> 15:56.905
I'm Mrs. Lieberman.

15:56.907 --> 15:59.407
I'm a big fan
of your father.

15:59.409 --> 16:01.142
Look at him up there.

16:01.144 --> 16:03.344
He's cooler than
a cucumber, isn't he?

16:03.346 --> 16:06.580
Oh, man, I hate stairs.

16:06.582 --> 16:08.485
Ah...

16:11.153 --> 16:12.989
Okay.

16:17.526 --> 16:18.592
Oh!

16:18.594 --> 16:20.327
That's gotta hurt.

16:20.329 --> 16:23.195
Oh, yes! Pay up, baby!

16:24.999 --> 16:28.568
Oh, I mean, oh no,
you got this, Norm!

16:31.340 --> 16:35.643
Okay.

16:37.612 --> 16:39.278
Can we...?
Oh, you wanna...?

16:39.280 --> 16:41.212
- Okay, so...
- All right. Ooh.

16:42.684 --> 16:44.052
- Yeah.
- Okay.

16:46.054 --> 16:50.188
Norm, you are a true example
of leadership and goodness.

16:50.190 --> 16:53.491
You not only saved your
kingdom from destruction,

16:53.493 --> 16:56.728
but also inspired us
to be as courageous,

16:56.730 --> 17:00.298
as good,
and as trustworthy as you.

17:00.300 --> 17:02.634
And as a symbol
of our trust in you,

17:02.636 --> 17:06.470
it is my honor to present
the Key to the City,

17:06.472 --> 17:08.705
the highest honor
we can bestow.

17:08.708 --> 17:13.477
It is a key that opens every
single door in the entire city.

17:13.479 --> 17:16.146
Wow, Mayor,
this is a great honor.

17:16.148 --> 17:19.016
Don't you worry, I'm gonna
guard this thing with my life.

17:22.154 --> 17:24.554
All right now,
ladies and gentlemen,

17:24.556 --> 17:26.656
our great friend
Norm of the North

17:26.659 --> 17:30.694
is now going to dazzle
us with a speech.

17:30.696 --> 17:31.728
Right, Norm?

17:31.730 --> 17:33.230
Uh...

17:33.232 --> 17:35.064
You prepared a speech,
didn't ya?

17:35.066 --> 17:37.533
Oh, oh.

17:37.535 --> 17:39.703
Just... Okay.

17:39.705 --> 17:42.039
A speech, uh...

17:42.041 --> 17:43.506
Don't worry, Norm!

17:43.508 --> 17:45.009
You got this.

17:45.011 --> 17:48.080
Just imagine
everyone naked!

17:50.281 --> 17:51.647
Wait a minute.

17:51.649 --> 17:53.249
I'm the only one
who's naked!

17:58.289 --> 18:00.255
Sorry about that, everyone.

18:00.257 --> 18:03.962
If I can be honest with you,
I'm extremely nervous right now.

18:05.429 --> 18:07.463
He might not be as
bad as I thought.

18:07.465 --> 18:09.564
I know I'm not
the smartest bear.

18:09.566 --> 18:11.433
I may not be the best looking.

18:11.435 --> 18:14.735
I'm pretty inarticulate.
I'm incredibly clumsy.

18:14.737 --> 18:17.772
If you would have told me that one
day I'd be representing the Arctic

18:17.774 --> 18:20.742
in New York City, accepting
the coolest award ever

18:20.744 --> 18:23.211
from such an amazing mayor,

18:23.213 --> 18:25.113
I would have laughed.

18:25.115 --> 18:27.249
But here I am, representing
the Arctic in New York City

18:27.251 --> 18:29.050
accepting
the coolest award ever,

18:29.052 --> 18:32.721
and the only thing
I can do is laugh.

18:32.723 --> 18:35.258
Oh.

18:37.126 --> 18:40.193
Okay, I have to admit
I'm impressed.

18:40.195 --> 18:43.230
And I wouldn't have been able to do
it without my family and my friends.

18:43.232 --> 18:45.465
Quinn, I love you
like a son, buddy!

18:45.467 --> 18:46.733
I am your son!

18:49.438 --> 18:53.307
And Vera and Olympia,
my very best friends...

18:53.309 --> 18:54.808
I love you like family.

18:54.810 --> 18:57.144
In fact, I love
you all like family!

18:57.146 --> 19:01.117
On behalf of the Arctic, I want
to thank you for this great honor.

19:11.559 --> 19:15.394
Norm, can I offer you and
your entourage a ride home...

19:15.396 --> 19:18.664
in this 40-foot stretch limo?

19:18.666 --> 19:21.667
Tempting. But when in New York,
do as the New Yorkers do.

19:21.669 --> 19:23.367
I think we'll walk home.

19:23.369 --> 19:25.336
Suit yourself, Norm.
See you later.

19:25.338 --> 19:27.509
Enjoy the Key
to the City.

19:29.109 --> 19:31.309
Dad, are you out of
your mind?

19:31.311 --> 19:33.178
Turning down
a ride with the mayor...

19:33.180 --> 19:34.779
you're the King of the Arctic.

19:34.781 --> 19:36.481
I'm a bear of the people,

19:36.483 --> 19:38.450
And you don't become
a bear of the people

19:38.452 --> 19:40.818
by riding around
in fancy 40-foot limos.

19:40.820 --> 19:43.822
Hey-hey, thanks!
Yeah, sure, bring it in here.

19:43.824 --> 19:46.290
Aw, come on,
let's get everybody in.

19:46.292 --> 19:47.725
Yeah! Oh, good. Oh, yeah!

19:47.727 --> 19:50.128
Norm, I'm Mrs. Lieberman.

19:50.130 --> 19:52.430
Would you mind
taking a picture?

19:52.432 --> 19:54.801
For you,
Mrs. Lieberman, anything!

19:56.336 --> 19:58.337
Say "macaroni!"

20:02.808 --> 20:06.276
Norm! Norm! Norm!

20:06.278 --> 20:08.712
Norm, ol' buddy, ol' pal.

20:08.714 --> 20:10.515
Hey, Larry!

20:10.517 --> 20:13.182
Hey, guys, guys,
this is my friend Larry!

20:13.184 --> 20:14.851
You look just like me.

20:14.853 --> 20:16.652
But why do
you look like me?

20:16.654 --> 20:19.256
Since your last triumphant
trip to The Big Apple

20:19.258 --> 20:22.225
the market for Norm
impersonators has skyrocketed!

20:22.227 --> 20:24.593
My career is booming.

20:24.595 --> 20:27.863
I've even got a one-bear play
off off-Broadway.

20:27.865 --> 20:29.833
You almost blew my cover!

20:29.835 --> 20:33.469
Well, I'm happy for you.
It's an amazing costume.

20:33.471 --> 20:35.437
Norm, I know you're busy.

20:35.439 --> 20:39.240
I just wanted to say
I saw your speech and, buddy,

20:39.242 --> 20:43.147
I'm pretty impressed
with the king you've become.

20:44.949 --> 20:47.483
<i>I'm pretty inarticulate.</i>

20:47.485 --> 20:49.851
- <i>If you would have told me that one day...</i>
- Hey, Dad...

20:49.853 --> 20:52.688
it was really cool seeing you with
all the people up there today.

20:52.690 --> 20:55.256
I'm really proud to
have you as my dad.

20:55.258 --> 20:58.430
- You're a great king.
- Thanks, buddy.

21:15.879 --> 21:18.612
Dad! Dad, you gotta
see this!

21:18.614 --> 21:20.314
Ahh! I'm up! I'm up!

21:20.316 --> 21:22.216
Dad, you're
on every channel!

21:22.218 --> 21:25.484
I don't doubt it.
They love me here.

21:25.486 --> 21:26.954
No, in a bad way.

21:26.956 --> 21:28.888
There were a bunch
of robberies last night,

21:28.890 --> 21:30.924
and the entire city
thinks you did it!

21:30.926 --> 21:32.892
- What? This has gotta be a mistake.
- What's going on?

21:32.894 --> 21:37.330
<i>Ahem. Is Norm of the North
a bank robber?</i>

21:39.701 --> 21:42.703
<i>Money has vanished from three banks.
We're looking into it.</i>

21:42.705 --> 21:45.472
<i>We're searching cameras
around the city.</i>

21:45.474 --> 21:49.774
<i>I want to urge everyone to remain calm
until we get to the bottom of this.</i>

21:49.776 --> 21:53.713
<i>Stay calm?
How can I stay calm?</i>

21:53.715 --> 21:56.916
I've lost my entire
life savings.

21:56.918 --> 21:59.685
I'll lose my house!

21:59.687 --> 22:01.454
Poor Mrs. Lieberman.

22:01.456 --> 22:02.922
This doesn't make sense.

22:02.924 --> 22:05.390
Why would anyone
think I did this?

22:05.392 --> 22:07.792
<i>Warning. Norm
shouldn't be trusted.</i>

22:07.794 --> 22:09.331
<i>Let's take a closer look.</i>

22:21.641 --> 22:23.375
I can't find
the key anywhere!

22:23.377 --> 22:25.780
Come on! Where is it?
Where is it?

22:27.380 --> 22:29.280
Someone stole
the Key to the City!

22:29.282 --> 22:33.784
Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no, this is bad!
This is bad!

22:33.786 --> 22:36.953
Norm is a lot of things,
but a crook ain't one of 'em.

22:36.955 --> 22:40.290
He's a big goofy bear
with a heart of gold.

22:40.292 --> 22:42.462
Somethin' isn't addin' up.

22:45.630 --> 22:47.330
We have to help!

22:47.332 --> 22:49.935
- He's my dad.
- He's my best friend.

23:09.486 --> 23:11.320
Hey, whoa, stop!

23:11.322 --> 23:13.388
Rewind it back, right there,
when he's on the stairs!

23:13.390 --> 23:16.459
- That's not my dad!
- How can you be so sure?

23:16.461 --> 23:18.528
My dad doesn't do
stairs well.

23:18.530 --> 23:21.333
Plus, he's never stolen
anything in his life.

23:23.967 --> 23:27.835
See? My dad would've been on
his butt after the first step.

23:27.837 --> 23:29.071
Definitely not him.

23:29.073 --> 23:31.776
Good point.
So who is it?

23:35.479 --> 23:37.746
Wait a second. What about
the Norm look-a-like...

23:37.748 --> 23:40.114
with the mustache
who smells like macaroni?

23:40.116 --> 23:43.818
Uncle Larry? No, he'd never do
anything to hurt my dad's reputation.

23:43.820 --> 23:45.386
He loves him.

23:45.388 --> 23:46.987
Well, he's
the only person I've seen

23:46.989 --> 23:49.856
with a suit that good,
so maybe he knows something.

23:49.858 --> 23:51.525
Okay, let's go find him.

23:51.527 --> 23:52.729
Put 'em in.

23:54.763 --> 23:58.532
- For your dad.
- For your best friend.

24:18.787 --> 24:20.690
Larry, there you are!

24:23.424 --> 24:24.923
What's wrong?

24:24.925 --> 24:28.495
What's wrong?
What's wrong?

24:28.497 --> 24:29.963
Uh, I asked you first?

24:29.965 --> 24:31.667
That's what's wrong!

24:33.000 --> 24:35.967
Your dad is public enemy
number one!

24:35.969 --> 24:38.169
What happened
to your new costume?

24:38.171 --> 24:40.938
You're kidding. I can't
wear that thing in public.

24:40.940 --> 24:43.675
I'd get spit on
even more!

24:43.677 --> 24:46.844
Anyway, it's at the dry cleaners,
and it's going to stay there.

24:46.846 --> 24:50.149
It's at the cleaners?
Interesting.

24:50.151 --> 24:53.451
I'll give you the ticket,
you can have it.

24:53.453 --> 24:56.088
I know your dad
is innocent.

24:56.090 --> 25:00.928
Tell him ol' Larry
is firmly on Team Norm!

25:03.897 --> 25:05.862
Ta!

25:14.841 --> 25:16.808
The costume is gone!

25:16.810 --> 25:18.775
The dry cleaners was
robbed yesterday too,

25:18.777 --> 25:20.177
and someone
took the costume.

25:20.179 --> 25:22.445
- Any clues?
- Not really.

25:22.447 --> 25:24.680
Security footage just
shows a shadowy figure.

25:24.682 --> 25:28.185
Oh, man, we're never
gonna solve this!

25:29.822 --> 25:31.821
Not so fast.
Look at this.

25:31.823 --> 25:34.191
11 pm, Lex Bank
was robbed.

25:34.193 --> 25:36.025
Two am, SoHo Bank.

25:36.027 --> 25:38.561
And then an hour later,
the Christopher Street Bank.

25:38.563 --> 25:40.797
Those are the three
biggest banks in the city.

25:40.799 --> 25:43.666
The fourth is
the Bank of Chinatown.

25:43.668 --> 25:46.836
Ah-ha! So you think they'll
hit that one next?

25:46.838 --> 25:49.905
Yes. And that bank is only a
few blocks from the East River

25:49.907 --> 25:52.974
and the Atlantic Ocean.
You know what that means?

25:52.976 --> 25:55.010
No, what?

25:55.012 --> 25:57.245
It means that the robber is
prepared to make a clean escape!

25:57.247 --> 26:00.081
He's going to rob the bank
and sail away scot free!

26:00.083 --> 26:01.983
Well, we can't
let that happen.

26:01.985 --> 26:05.890
Let's head to the bank
and catch this guy red-handed.

26:12.529 --> 26:14.761
Okay, discretion is key.

26:14.763 --> 26:17.164
We need to be silent,
with stealth, and...

26:17.166 --> 26:19.736
Oh.

26:20.704 --> 26:23.504
It's my mom.

26:23.506 --> 26:25.772
<i>You're in big trouble,
young lady!</i>

26:25.774 --> 26:28.675
I know, but Mom,
I think we cracked the case.

26:28.677 --> 26:31.078
<i>Vera, we know where
the robber is gonna hit next!</i>

26:31.080 --> 26:33.514
- <i>First we talked to Lawrence...</i>
- <i>Who led us to the dry cleaners...</i>

26:33.516 --> 26:35.883
- <i>Who said the suit was stolen...</i>
- <i>But now we're in Chinatown...</i>

26:35.885 --> 26:38.151
<i>At the bank!</i>

26:38.153 --> 26:39.920
Whoa, slow down.

26:39.922 --> 26:42.088
I didn't follow any of that.
Stay where you are!

26:42.090 --> 26:44.090
- I'm coming.
- We're coming!

26:44.092 --> 26:47.728
Norm, it's too risky. Half
the city is looking for you.

26:47.730 --> 26:49.031
Hmm.

26:52.867 --> 26:54.166
Hi, Mom.

26:54.168 --> 26:55.868
Where's my dad?

26:55.870 --> 26:57.671
I'm right here.

26:57.673 --> 26:59.672
Uh! Oh. Wow.

26:59.674 --> 27:03.709
- Norm?
- It's just a disguise. Relax.

27:03.711 --> 27:06.546
Can we just focus
on the matter at hand, please?

27:06.548 --> 27:08.280
- Yeah. Let's go!
- Good idea.

27:08.282 --> 27:10.650
First, I gotta
get out of this.

27:10.652 --> 27:12.020
It's a little itchy.

27:18.192 --> 27:21.594
Holy shnikes!
He's in there!

27:55.694 --> 27:57.026
He's running away!

27:57.028 --> 27:58.797
I got him!

28:15.680 --> 28:18.781
It looked like something was
beating up the Fake Norm.

28:18.783 --> 28:19.916
What was it?

28:19.918 --> 28:21.985
- Ow!
- Hyah!

28:21.987 --> 28:24.887
More robbers, huh?

28:27.025 --> 28:29.726
No, we're trying
to stop the robbers.

28:29.728 --> 28:31.127
Just like you, Fong.

28:31.129 --> 28:34.631
Hold up.
You know this... thing?

28:36.065 --> 28:38.633
Ow! Cut it out!

28:39.870 --> 28:41.637
Both of you, stop!

28:41.639 --> 28:44.639
This is Fong, the face
of the Bank of Chinatown.

28:44.641 --> 28:47.376
I've heard stories.
Now I know they're true.

28:47.378 --> 28:49.077
You are a financial wizard.

28:49.079 --> 28:53.782
Meh! It's all
in the lucky foot.

28:53.784 --> 28:56.821
Someone is framing Norm of
the North for the robberies.

28:57.852 --> 28:58.319
But he's innocent.

28:58.321 --> 29:01.088
- I know this.
- How do you know?

29:01.090 --> 29:02.793
Easy.

29:04.893 --> 29:07.328
Robbers' suits
have a zipper.

29:07.330 --> 29:09.366
Real bears don't
have zippers.

29:10.766 --> 29:12.667
Hey guys, look at this.

29:18.240 --> 29:19.340
Oh!

29:19.342 --> 29:20.611
Ooh!

29:46.766 --> 29:49.203
<i>We got you surrounded, Norm!</i>

29:50.236 --> 29:51.803
I can see that.

29:53.773 --> 29:56.777
Oh, Normie.

30:06.753 --> 30:10.390
Whoa, Quinn, Quinn,
there is nothing you can do now.

30:11.724 --> 30:13.290
Fong will help you.

30:13.292 --> 30:16.126
Fong knows Norm
is a good bear.

30:16.128 --> 30:20.464
You know, you should be
proud of your father.

30:20.466 --> 30:23.934
This Fake Norm
robbing banks is a coward,

30:23.936 --> 30:28.039
and to find him,
we need to find the money.

30:28.041 --> 30:29.807
The East River.

30:29.809 --> 30:31.108
You guys go there.

30:31.110 --> 30:33.144
I will go save
Norm from jail...

30:33.146 --> 30:36.148
and I will take
Norm's helpers.

30:44.088 --> 30:46.990
You're done, Norm.
You'll never get out of here.

30:46.992 --> 30:49.192
You'll never see
your family again.

30:49.194 --> 30:53.163
You'll never see
the Arctic again!

30:53.165 --> 30:56.767
Just when you believe that a
leader has humanity and goodness,

30:56.769 --> 30:58.800
he goes and does
somethin' like this.

30:58.802 --> 31:01.836
You're telling me. I had my
life savings in that bank.

31:01.838 --> 31:05.143
I don't know how I'll afford
college for my kids now.

31:18.955 --> 31:20.192
Ow.

31:24.294 --> 31:26.393
Lemmings!

31:26.395 --> 31:28.062
Who are you?

31:28.064 --> 31:31.865
I am Fong. I know you
have many questions,

31:31.867 --> 31:35.236
but please, do not talk
until we get you out of here.

31:35.238 --> 31:39.841
First, I have a very important
message from your son, Quinn.

31:45.515 --> 31:50.150
Pastrami on pretzel bread.
No pickles. Extra cheese.

31:50.152 --> 31:52.018
Fries. Diet cola.

31:52.020 --> 31:54.287
Oh, wait, that was
my receipt from lunch.

31:54.289 --> 31:56.957
Sorry. Here we are:

31:56.959 --> 32:00.194
"Dad, you've always
been a true king..."

32:00.196 --> 32:03.063
"because you're so human.
You're kind."

32:03.065 --> 32:07.400
"Oh and P.S., stairs are
overrated, and I love you."

32:09.204 --> 32:11.336
That's enough, guys.

32:24.585 --> 32:27.553
Attention,
all police officers.

32:27.555 --> 32:29.988
There are free donuts
in the lobby.

32:29.990 --> 32:34.059
I repeat, there are
free donuts in the lobby.

32:34.061 --> 32:35.427
<i>That is all.</i>

32:35.429 --> 32:39.333
Ooh!
Hut, hut, hut!

32:50.076 --> 32:52.944
<i>We have Norm.
The walrus is beached.</i>

32:52.946 --> 32:55.312
I repeat,
the walrus is beached.

32:55.314 --> 32:56.982
<i>Hey, really?!</i>

32:56.984 --> 32:58.514
That's great!
We have the barge.

32:58.516 --> 33:00.149
Walrus is
beached here, too.

33:03.155 --> 33:06.423
Uh... On second thought,
the walrus is unbeached.

33:06.425 --> 33:07.891
No beach in sight.

33:07.893 --> 33:10.194
The barge is leaving.

33:10.196 --> 33:12.562
<i>We have to make sure that the
money doesn't leave our sight.</i>

33:12.564 --> 33:15.899
How are we going to stop
the money from leaving?

33:15.901 --> 33:17.667
I have an idea.

33:17.669 --> 33:21.440
I am rich.
I have my ways.

33:53.169 --> 33:55.569
Huh?

33:55.571 --> 33:56.704
Huh.

33:56.706 --> 33:59.641
You guys look familiar.

33:59.643 --> 34:03.211
Fong, you and the lemmings get
this boat back to the harbor.

34:03.213 --> 34:05.416
I'll take care
of these goons.

34:09.953 --> 34:11.117
Unh!

34:11.119 --> 34:13.587
- Aah! Wha?
- You!

34:13.589 --> 34:15.523
You took my money!

34:15.525 --> 34:16.560
Aah!

34:37.745 --> 34:40.181
Get that stupid bear!

35:06.606 --> 35:08.143
Aah!

35:12.313 --> 35:14.079
Uncle! Uncle!

35:15.782 --> 35:17.952
Whoa!

35:30.796 --> 35:31.795
Whoa!

35:31.797 --> 35:33.263
Oh! Huh?

35:33.265 --> 35:35.336
Aahhh!

35:40.272 --> 35:42.473
Oh... huh?

35:45.811 --> 35:48.044
Ooh.

35:48.046 --> 35:50.546
Nice work, team. These
guys aren't going anywhere.

35:50.548 --> 35:53.182
We retrieved all the money.
It's here.

35:53.184 --> 35:57.354
But we still don't know who
calls shots for the henchmen.

35:57.356 --> 36:00.724
Who really stole the money?

36:00.726 --> 36:02.758
Let's return the money
to the mayor.

36:02.760 --> 36:04.660
He'll know I'm innocent!
He'll help us!

36:04.662 --> 36:07.233
Lemmings, turn this boat around!

36:14.071 --> 36:16.471
Mayor Freeman, is it true Norm
was proven innocent?

36:16.473 --> 36:18.207
Any idea who the real
bank robber is?

36:18.209 --> 36:20.308
Does anyone have a waffle maker?

36:20.310 --> 36:22.844
Patience, everyone. There
will be time for questions.

36:22.846 --> 36:27.116
But for now, let's give
a big round of applause...

36:27.118 --> 36:28.850
to the heroes of the hour...

36:28.852 --> 36:32.456
Norm of the North and Fong!

36:34.657 --> 36:37.291
C'mon guys, let's get
a group pic!

36:37.293 --> 36:41.095
I'm just happy that good folks like Mrs.
Lieberman got their money back.

36:42.698 --> 36:45.166
Sorry, sorry. It's the cologne.

36:45.168 --> 36:47.602
It's an acquired taste,
I suppose.

36:47.604 --> 36:50.604
Hey, someone bring us a bag
of Fong's money for the picture.

36:50.606 --> 36:52.106
Wouldn't that be nice, Fong?

36:52.108 --> 36:56.144
Oh, of course. I love my money.

36:56.146 --> 36:57.648
Of course you do.

37:05.621 --> 37:08.825
Wait a minute. That bag,
it smells like...

37:10.759 --> 37:12.893
That bag smells like the mayor.

37:12.895 --> 37:14.795
The money smells like the mayor!

37:14.797 --> 37:16.830
The mayor smells like the money!

37:16.832 --> 37:18.831
Hmm? Hmm...

37:18.833 --> 37:21.400
Well, I-I don't know what
you're talkin' about.

37:32.713 --> 37:36.682
Hey, this is the
Key to the City. My key!

37:37.919 --> 37:40.385
Norm, look up!

37:40.387 --> 37:44.490
The mayor is the bad guy.
We have definitive pr-

37:44.492 --> 37:46.458
pr-pr-pr-pr...

37:46.460 --> 37:48.927
ah... ahchooo!!!

37:48.929 --> 37:51.163
Police, stop the mayor!

37:51.165 --> 37:52.396
You heard him, Tony.

37:52.398 --> 37:54.431
Stop him from doin' what?

37:54.433 --> 37:55.900
Oh, yeah, I get it.

37:55.902 --> 37:58.670
Mayor Freeman,
you're under arrest.

37:58.672 --> 38:00.505
Me? Under arrest?

38:00.507 --> 38:02.541
Ha ha!
I'm the Mayor!

38:02.543 --> 38:04.608
I'm as powerful as a king!

38:04.610 --> 38:06.645
I can do what I want!

38:06.647 --> 38:09.380
That's not
what being a king is.

38:09.382 --> 38:12.950
Being a king is the responsibility of
knowing what's right and what's wrong.

38:12.952 --> 38:16.787
And to know that if you do something
wrong, you apologize for it!

38:16.789 --> 38:18.656
Haven't you
learned yet, Norm?

38:18.658 --> 38:20.957
A leader never apologizes.

38:20.959 --> 38:24.694
A leader makes people
apologize to him!

38:24.696 --> 38:27.531
- I'm sorry, Mr. Mayor...
- See?

38:27.533 --> 38:29.899
No. I meant,
I'm sorry...

38:29.901 --> 38:31.801
but you have to
go to jail now.

38:31.803 --> 38:34.503
I don't think so.
Ha ha!

39:12.910 --> 39:13.944
Huh?

39:18.816 --> 39:21.319
Huh? Huh?

39:24.786 --> 39:26.720
Fong, get as
close as you can.

39:26.722 --> 39:28.856
Norm, what are you
going to do?

39:28.858 --> 39:31.862
I'm gonna make him
apologize to the people.

39:42.639 --> 39:44.841
Huh?

39:47.042 --> 39:48.808
Geronimo!

40:01.823 --> 40:04.227
Whoa!

40:06.495 --> 40:08.027
Don't look down.

40:08.029 --> 40:09.961
Ahh! Don't look down!
Don't look down!

40:09.963 --> 40:13.901
Okay! Okay, yeah!
Yeah, that's high!

40:16.436 --> 40:17.471
Whoa!

40:20.508 --> 40:22.608
Oh, you!

40:22.610 --> 40:23.644
Oh!

40:40.592 --> 40:42.627
Get him, Norm!

40:42.629 --> 40:45.399
I won't let you down,
Mrs. Lieberman!

40:54.406 --> 40:56.107
You wanna go?

40:56.109 --> 40:57.709
<i>Auto pilot engaged.</i>

40:58.910 --> 41:00.977
Okay Mr. King of the Arctic,

41:00.979 --> 41:02.646
meet The King of the Ring!

41:04.515 --> 41:06.483
- Okay!
- Are you sure you wanna do this

41:06.485 --> 41:09.519
Mr. Mayor? I outweigh
you by like 900 pounds.

41:13.124 --> 41:15.792
You're gonna be locked up
for a long time.

41:15.794 --> 41:19.428
But before that,
you are going to apologize.

41:19.430 --> 41:21.529
Are you ready
to apologize?

41:21.531 --> 41:24.400
Never.

41:24.402 --> 41:25.867
Hmm...

41:29.507 --> 41:32.311
How about now?
Are you ready to apologize now?

41:45.789 --> 41:48.423
<i>It has been revealed that
the mayor</i>

41:48.425 --> 41:50.124
<i>was impersonating
Norm of the North</i>

41:50.126 --> 41:52.727
<i>in an elaborate scheme
to steal money</i>

41:52.729 --> 41:55.629
<i>to fund
his presidential campaign.</i>

41:55.631 --> 41:58.432
<i>But in heroic fashion,
Norm tracked down the money</i>

41:58.434 --> 42:00.535
<i>and returned it to
its rightful owners.</i>

42:00.537 --> 42:03.738
<i>This begs the question,
"Should Norm run for mayor?"</i>

42:03.740 --> 42:06.640
Uhh, well...

42:06.642 --> 42:08.810
I don't know
what to say.

42:08.812 --> 42:10.710
Well, that's
a first.

42:10.712 --> 42:14.181
To the wonderful
citizens of New York,

42:14.183 --> 42:16.983
the greatest city
on this earth,

42:18.654 --> 42:21.989
I am embarrassed.
I am humiliated.

42:21.991 --> 42:23.657
I am...

42:23.659 --> 42:25.726
I deserve this.

42:25.728 --> 42:29.896
And I'm sorry for everything
I've done to this great city.

42:29.898 --> 42:32.498
All right boys, take me away.

42:32.500 --> 42:36.971
Speech! Speech! Speech!

42:41.810 --> 42:43.910
Norm for President!

42:43.912 --> 42:45.481
I love you, Norm!

42:50.118 --> 42:52.752
<i>We will be heading back
to the Arctic now.</i>

42:52.754 --> 42:54.886
See you later, New York!

42:54.888 --> 42:55.923
Don't let your meat loaf!

42:59.860 --> 43:03.028
- It was great hanging with you, Olympia.
- Agreed.

43:03.030 --> 43:07.097
You're an awesome kid, Quinn.
I'm going to miss you.

43:07.099 --> 43:08.767
You guys should
come visit us

43:08.769 --> 43:10.769
in the Arctic,
meet the rest of the family.

43:10.771 --> 43:13.472
What do you say?
Maybe Spring Break?

43:13.474 --> 43:16.842
- Well, I don't see why not...
- Count me in!

43:16.844 --> 43:18.742
Love it.

43:18.744 --> 43:21.511
I love it!
Sounds like a great plan!

43:27.085 --> 43:30.857
Dad, come out here,
we're almost home!

43:37.763 --> 43:39.799
Look, it's Mt. Arcmore!

43:42.167 --> 43:43.766
<i>Your face is done!</i>

43:43.768 --> 43:46.001
<i>Wow. I guess
it's true.</i>

43:46.003 --> 43:48.173
<i>The ice does add 300 pounds.</i>

43:51.642 --> 43:55.481
Dad, it's the king
everyone loves.

44:02.019 --> 44:05.657
All right, lemmings, first day
back to work and I feel great!

44:06.825 --> 44:07.990
Looking good, Norm!

44:07.992 --> 44:09.757
Feeling good, Louis!

44:09.759 --> 44:11.993
Congrats on taking down
Mayor Freeman!

44:11.995 --> 44:15.933
You made us proud, Norm!
Glad to have you back!

44:20.670 --> 44:21.705
Ahh!

44:27.210 --> 44:28.545
Whoa, hold on!

44:33.916 --> 44:37.053
Ugh! Traffic jam!

44:38.755 --> 44:40.153
Hey, let's go!

44:40.155 --> 44:42.122
I'm gonna be
late for lunch.

44:42.124 --> 44:44.892
Sorry, chief. It's been
like this all day.

44:44.894 --> 44:47.294
Welcome back,
by the way.

44:47.296 --> 44:49.564
Honk! Honk! Honk!

44:49.566 --> 44:51.832
I wonder what's
holding everyone up.

44:51.834 --> 44:53.837
This gridlock is really...

44:55.037 --> 44:56.604
Garbage?

44:56.606 --> 44:58.137
Where are the cleaning crews?

44:58.139 --> 45:00.574
Are they on strike?

45:00.576 --> 45:03.643
Yeah, you know your brother
loves to have a good time.

45:03.645 --> 45:05.210
Leave him unsupervised,

45:05.212 --> 45:08.047
things are obviously gonna
get a little messy.

45:08.049 --> 45:10.282
This one's on you, big guy.

45:10.284 --> 45:12.719
I get that it's important
to stay hydrated,

45:12.721 --> 45:14.286
but this is a little much.

45:14.288 --> 45:15.957
Where'd these water
bottles come from?

45:20.328 --> 45:23.629
I go away for two weeks
and this place is falling apart!

45:23.631 --> 45:25.267
Lemmings, take me to Stan.

45:46.386 --> 45:48.085
King Norm speaking.

45:48.087 --> 45:52.255
Norm, my friend!
How's the Far North?

45:52.257 --> 45:54.692
Because down here,
things are great!

45:54.694 --> 45:57.061
Since we revealed
Mayor Freeman's plan

45:57.063 --> 45:58.896
and saved people's money,

45:58.898 --> 46:01.268
everyone is moving
their money into my bank!

46:02.902 --> 46:04.936
That's great, Fong.
You run a great bank.

46:04.938 --> 46:07.271
<i>And it's mostly
thanks to you.</i>

46:07.273 --> 46:11.174
You are a true hero
and a good bear.

46:11.176 --> 46:13.209
I'm trying to follow
in your footsteps

46:13.211 --> 46:15.245
and keep the bank extra safe.

46:15.247 --> 46:16.946
After all,

46:16.948 --> 46:19.149
no one can protect
what's valuable to them

46:19.151 --> 46:20.317
like themselves.

46:22.187 --> 46:25.058
I wish the animals
up here believed that.

46:46.411 --> 46:49.077
Maria takes the puck
across center ice,

46:49.079 --> 46:50.679
her stick handling is awesome.

46:50.681 --> 46:52.884
She fakes left, she fakes right.

46:55.152 --> 46:56.351
Yikes!

46:58.754 --> 47:01.388
You're supposed to try
and block it, Uncle Stan,

47:01.390 --> 47:02.390
not let me score!

47:04.326 --> 47:07.897
Easier said than done, kiddo!
You are too good!

47:09.299 --> 47:11.366
Hey, big bro!

47:11.368 --> 47:13.835
Stan, you were
supposed to be in charge

47:13.837 --> 47:14.935
and you're playing games?

47:14.937 --> 47:16.805
I'm having fun,

47:16.807 --> 47:18.205
for the first time
in my life.

47:18.207 --> 47:20.442
Well, no wonder
the Arctic's a mess.

47:20.444 --> 47:23.010
Oh sorry, "King Norm".

47:23.012 --> 47:26.012
Sorry I'm not as responsible
and kingly as you...

47:26.014 --> 47:28.048
Your Majesty!

47:28.050 --> 47:31.418
Yeah, Dad, we're just
having some fun.

47:31.420 --> 47:34.988
Uncle Stan's been
teaching me how to shoot!

47:34.990 --> 47:38.392
Oh, and I'm glad he is!
You've gotten so good.

47:38.394 --> 47:41.294
Yeah, bro. You're good
at being king.

47:41.296 --> 47:42.863
I'm good at playing hockey.

47:42.865 --> 47:44.164
Okay.

47:44.166 --> 47:46.098
And these new sticks
are so cool.

47:46.100 --> 47:47.866
I see that.
Where'd you get 'em?

47:47.868 --> 47:49.170
From Uncle Stan's friends.

47:56.977 --> 47:59.312
- Stan.
- Oh, relax, Norm.

47:59.314 --> 48:01.313
It's just a water company.

48:01.315 --> 48:04.750
They're not moving in,
so it's not as bad as it looks.

48:04.752 --> 48:07.520
It looks like they're
taking ice away!

48:07.522 --> 48:11.859
Well, then, yeah,
it's as bad as it looks.

48:14.093 --> 48:15.260
Hey, you!

48:15.262 --> 48:17.262
Da? Oh!

48:17.264 --> 48:21.533
It's Norm of the North,
the famous talking polar bear!

48:21.535 --> 48:23.934
Hey, guys, come see this!

48:25.506 --> 48:27.773
No, that's King Norm to you.

48:27.775 --> 48:31.910
Oh. So, you're not
the famous talking polar bear?

48:31.912 --> 48:34.244
- False alarm!
- <i>Oh.</i>

48:34.246 --> 48:37.480
What? No, I just mean,
I have a title.

48:37.482 --> 48:41.252
I'm the famous bear,
but I'm also a king. The King.

48:41.254 --> 48:43.052
And I demand you tell me,

48:43.054 --> 48:45.389
why are you taking our ice,
and on whose orders?!

48:45.391 --> 48:47.223
Orders from our
Prime Minister.

48:47.225 --> 48:49.428
He runs this company. Look.

48:54.033 --> 48:56.966
"Far North Water.
The purest water there is."

48:56.968 --> 48:59.368
See, his plan
is to get ice

48:59.370 --> 49:01.537
from the farthest
reaches of the North,

49:01.539 --> 49:03.573
which would be
where we are now,

49:03.575 --> 49:06.843
and then melt it, sell it,
and people drink it!

49:06.845 --> 49:08.410
I don't understand.

49:08.412 --> 49:10.580
Oh, well, it's
pretty simple actually.

49:10.582 --> 49:14.050
See, ice is
just frozen water...

49:14.052 --> 49:16.185
I understand how water works!

49:16.187 --> 49:18.588
I don't understand how
you can take our ice.

49:18.590 --> 49:20.222
This is our land.

49:20.224 --> 49:21.889
You can't just come in here
and do this.

49:21.891 --> 49:24.261
Well, we made
a deal with him.

49:27.297 --> 49:30.431
We give you
this hockey stuff, yes?

49:30.433 --> 49:34.335
And in exchange, we get to
drill this ice right here?

49:34.337 --> 49:37.572
Don't worry, ice grows back.

49:37.574 --> 49:39.042
Do we have deal?

49:41.045 --> 49:42.878
Ha ha!

49:44.447 --> 49:46.613
Whoa! Let's calm down
here, Normie.

49:46.615 --> 49:49.850
They were coming up here
no matter what, you know?

49:49.852 --> 49:53.087
Don't worry, "ice grows back!"

49:53.089 --> 49:55.793
We can't let them
steal our home.

49:56.859 --> 49:58.091
Can you believe this?

49:58.093 --> 50:00.227
They're stealing our ice!

50:00.229 --> 50:02.062
It's like my first day
back on the job

50:02.064 --> 50:03.330
<i>and already there's
an emergency.</i>

50:03.332 --> 50:04.631
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Back up.

50:04.633 --> 50:05.866
Who's stealing ice?

50:05.868 --> 50:07.136
These guys!

50:09.304 --> 50:11.204
Norm, uh,

50:11.206 --> 50:13.173
I think I've actually
seen that brand.

50:13.175 --> 50:16.041
Olympia, honey, see
what you can find out

50:16.043 --> 50:17.510
about Far North Water.

50:17.512 --> 50:19.382
Where they get their water.

50:22.184 --> 50:24.383
Oh, honey, click on
that commercial.

50:24.385 --> 50:26.353
Let's see what this company
is all about.

50:26.355 --> 50:30.056
As Prime Minister
of Taknekistan...

50:30.058 --> 50:32.291
it is my job to deliver

50:32.293 --> 50:34.225
my people coldest,

50:34.227 --> 50:37.663
freshest, purest water in world.

50:37.665 --> 50:41.165
That is why
we get our H2Os

50:41.167 --> 50:43.368
from the North Poles.

50:43.370 --> 50:46.305
Does not get more purer
than that.

50:46.307 --> 50:47.609
Am I right?

50:50.076 --> 50:51.979
Ahh!

50:53.546 --> 50:56.515
Hockey is sport of our national.

50:56.517 --> 50:59.383
And take it from
a champion like me,

50:59.385 --> 51:00.918
Benny Voulanov.

51:00.920 --> 51:03.054
And there can be no champion

51:03.056 --> 51:04.588
without water of champion.

51:04.590 --> 51:06.293
Far North.

51:08.695 --> 51:10.331
Yummy.

51:11.498 --> 51:13.231
The people of Taknekistan

51:13.233 --> 51:14.666
clearly love three things:

51:14.668 --> 51:18.336
Water, hockey,
and cheesy smiles.

51:18.338 --> 51:20.604
They have similar smiles
because Benny Voulanov

51:20.606 --> 51:22.138
is the Prime Minister's brother.

51:22.140 --> 51:24.574
And yes, Taknekistan
loves hockey.

51:24.576 --> 51:26.176
They've won
the gold medal

51:26.178 --> 51:28.045
in the last ten straight
Nation Games.

51:28.047 --> 51:29.980
Well, there has to
be some kind of law

51:29.982 --> 51:31.214
against stealing ice, right?

51:31.216 --> 51:32.582
That's what I said!

51:32.584 --> 51:34.250
There actually are laws
that prevent

51:34.252 --> 51:35.319
the removal of ice
from the Arctic

51:35.321 --> 51:37.020
without approval.

51:37.022 --> 51:38.554
So, what they're doing
is technically illegal

51:38.556 --> 51:40.556
since obviously no one
gave them permission.

51:40.558 --> 51:43.460
My brother Stan
gave them permission.

51:43.462 --> 51:45.660
<i>Wait a minute, not so fast.</i>

51:45.662 --> 51:47.495
We're in luck.

51:47.497 --> 51:49.564
According to the footnotes
of Section 2B, Paragraph 3

51:49.566 --> 51:51.700
of the Addendum to the
Arctic Conservation Act

51:51.702 --> 51:53.302
approval must be granted

51:53.304 --> 51:55.137
by a high ranking
government official.

51:55.139 --> 51:57.673
Stan isn't high ranking,
he's not in the government,

51:57.675 --> 51:59.742
and he's definitely
not official.

51:59.744 --> 52:03.445
<i>See Norm, this is great news.
No reason to panic.</i>

52:03.447 --> 52:06.615
No, no, no! He is a high
ranking government official.

52:06.617 --> 52:08.450
Stan begged me to
be in my cabinet

52:08.452 --> 52:11.185
so I threw him
a courtesy title of Vice King.

52:11.187 --> 52:12.587
What was I thinking?

52:12.589 --> 52:15.592
I gotta go talk to Socrates.

52:20.496 --> 52:23.297
Oh no! Socrates, stay with me!

52:23.299 --> 52:26.368
One, two, three, four.

52:26.370 --> 52:29.707
Breathe.
One, two, three.

52:36.745 --> 52:39.178
Come on buddy! Come on!

52:39.180 --> 52:40.580
Clear!

52:40.582 --> 52:42.749
Ohh!

52:42.751 --> 52:44.184
What are you doing?

52:44.186 --> 52:47.086
Get off me! I'm meditating!

52:48.758 --> 52:51.158
Meditating?
Oh. I assumed death.

52:51.160 --> 52:53.260
Sorry. I'm having a rough day.

52:53.262 --> 52:54.794
I walked up, saw your
lifeless bird body

52:54.796 --> 52:58.398
and immediately went to
worst case scenario.

52:58.400 --> 53:00.532
I need to tell you about...

53:00.534 --> 53:03.036
The water company is stealing all
our ice, and it's Stan's fault.

53:03.038 --> 53:04.637
Exactly!

53:04.639 --> 53:06.371
Wait.
How did you know about that?

53:06.373 --> 53:08.407
It doesn't matter.
What should I do?

53:08.409 --> 53:13.212
If Stan got you into this mess,
then make him get you out of it.

53:13.214 --> 53:16.349
If there's one word that properly
describes your brother, it's...

53:16.351 --> 53:19.384
Annoying, stupid,
soft, worthless...

53:19.386 --> 53:22.386
Whoa. Sounds like you're
the one who needs to meditate.

53:22.388 --> 53:25.057
I was going to say selfish.

53:25.059 --> 53:27.691
Right. Sorry.
Yes, Stan is selfish.

53:27.693 --> 53:30.662
Stan believes in
nothing but himself.

53:30.664 --> 53:34.598
So you must inspire him
to believe in something else

53:34.600 --> 53:37.102
something bigger than himself.

53:37.104 --> 53:39.071
How?

53:39.073 --> 53:41.839
Give him a challenge.
Use something he's good at.

53:41.841 --> 53:44.708
Norm, you're the king
and he's not...

53:44.710 --> 53:47.210
and that's hard
for your brother.

53:47.212 --> 53:51.181
So make him <i>something.</i>

53:51.183 --> 53:55.721
So basically, I need to
make my brother a hero?

53:56.721 --> 53:58.024
Exactly!

53:59.759 --> 54:03.226
As always, Socrates has
given me sound advice.

54:03.228 --> 54:05.329
I just have to figure out
how to put his advice to use.

54:05.331 --> 54:07.398
<i>Norm, like I told you...</i>

54:07.400 --> 54:10.165
<i>the only people
who can save their home</i>

54:10.167 --> 54:12.368
<i>are those who live in it.</i>

54:12.370 --> 54:14.404
Wow, I must be
losing my mind.

54:14.406 --> 54:16.138
I keep hearing Fong
in my head.

54:16.140 --> 54:19.274
No, Norm, you
butt dialed me again.

54:19.276 --> 54:22.312
- Sorry about that buddy.
- Okie-dokie, then.

54:22.314 --> 54:24.783
Hey!

54:40.664 --> 54:42.130
Huh?!

54:42.132 --> 54:45.202
Hot Soup! Ha ha ha!

54:46.903 --> 54:50.238
There can be no champion
without water of champion.

54:50.240 --> 54:51.675
Far North.

54:53.277 --> 54:55.177
Yummy.

54:55.179 --> 54:58.411
Water of champions, eh?

55:01.518 --> 55:03.183
Vera! I've got an idea.

55:03.185 --> 55:04.919
Can you get me
a televised press conference

55:04.921 --> 55:07.420
with the Prime
Minister of Taknekistan?

55:07.422 --> 55:09.924
It might be tough for me to get
a hold of the Prime Minister...

55:09.926 --> 55:12.859
but I think I know
someone who can.

55:12.861 --> 55:14.597
Fong!

55:28.911 --> 55:32.945
As King of the North, and as a
bear actually from the North,

55:32.947 --> 55:36.950
my animals would like to challenge
your workers to a best-of-three

55:36.952 --> 55:39.753
winner-take-all hockey match.

55:39.755 --> 55:41.521
Ooh!

55:41.523 --> 55:44.456
If we beat you,
you leave, for good.

55:44.458 --> 55:47.226
And if you win,
you take the ice.

55:49.462 --> 55:50.763
Hmm?

55:50.765 --> 55:52.730
Are you kidding me?

55:52.732 --> 55:56.801
Okay, King Norm,
you are on.

55:56.803 --> 56:00.973
Hockey, after all,
is our national pastime!

56:00.975 --> 56:03.411
We will crush you!

56:08.449 --> 56:10.582
Are you out of your mind, Norm!

56:10.584 --> 56:11.816
Play the humans?

56:11.818 --> 56:13.751
We can't play the humans!

56:13.753 --> 56:16.354
Yes, we can.
And we can beat them.

56:16.356 --> 56:17.888
This is it.

56:17.890 --> 56:21.225
My bro has gone crazy.
My bro is nuts!

56:21.227 --> 56:22.859
Stan, listen to me.

56:22.861 --> 56:26.231
If we are playing for our home,
nothing can stop us.

56:26.233 --> 56:27.999
And, I want you to be our coach.

56:28.001 --> 56:31.539
Whadd'ya say, Stan,
lead us to victory?

56:32.971 --> 56:35.906
Aw... come here, you!

56:38.743 --> 56:40.710
Listen up, folks.

56:40.712 --> 56:43.547
These are open tryouts
for the Arctic All-Stars.

56:43.549 --> 56:47.451
Decisions will be made by yours truly...
and yours quickly.

56:47.453 --> 56:49.886
We don't have much time to get a
team together to beat the humans,

56:49.888 --> 56:52.623
so please, if you stink...
ha ha ha ha!...

56:52.625 --> 56:54.791
- get out!
- Huh?

56:54.793 --> 56:58.294
Okay, I don't think
Stan means it like that.

56:58.296 --> 56:59.861
Yeah, I do.

56:59.863 --> 57:02.497
If you're no good,
don't waste my time.

57:02.499 --> 57:06.535
There's nothing more serious
than a bunch of different animals

57:06.537 --> 57:09.705
playing hockey together
against a bottled water outfit

57:09.707 --> 57:11.607
from down south...
nothing!

57:11.609 --> 57:13.345
Aah!

57:16.647 --> 57:18.850
- Aaah!
- Huh?

57:19.850 --> 57:20.882
Ohh!

57:25.454 --> 57:26.523
Ya-hey!

57:27.657 --> 57:29.023
Huh?

57:29.025 --> 57:31.928
Oh, come on, Rigoberto,
not again!

57:54.316 --> 57:55.749
Oh, yes!

57:57.519 --> 58:00.087
Okay, the final
roster is as follows.

58:00.089 --> 58:01.721
Mickey, you're in goal.

58:01.723 --> 58:03.723
Oh, yeah!

58:03.725 --> 58:06.459
Who's so lazy he'll never
amount to anything now, Mom!

58:06.461 --> 58:08.394
Maria, you're my left-winger.

58:08.396 --> 58:10.095
Seals, you're my defense.

58:10.097 --> 58:12.097
And finally, Lemmings.

58:12.099 --> 58:14.867
Alone, you're tiny,
squeaky, and smelly.

58:14.869 --> 58:16.802
But I have to admit it.
You're tough.

58:16.804 --> 58:18.604
That's what this
game is all about.

58:18.606 --> 58:21.410
Maybe if you stack
on top of each other?

58:22.710 --> 58:24.876
Yeah! We can work with that.

58:24.878 --> 58:26.912
Bingo. That's our team.

58:26.914 --> 58:29.048
Ahem! Ahem!
Ahem!

58:29.050 --> 58:32.354
Over here. You got a spot
for your king, little bro?

58:34.488 --> 58:37.089
Nope. Sorry, sport.

58:37.091 --> 58:40.024
Yeah, Norm, we're trying to win
here, not Arctic Shake 'em to death!

58:43.430 --> 58:44.962
Hmm.

58:44.964 --> 58:47.498
Thanks for coming, Fong.

58:47.500 --> 58:49.734
Norm asked us to put together a
marketing campaign for the Arctic

58:49.736 --> 58:51.803
get people on their side
and excited for the game.

58:51.805 --> 58:54.071
They also need help getting
enough equipment and funding.

58:54.073 --> 58:56.140
We've got a few issues.

58:56.142 --> 58:58.108
One, no one on the team
speaks human, other than Norm.

58:58.110 --> 59:00.443
Two, they don't fit
normal human-sized clothing

59:00.445 --> 59:02.412
so we need to be creative there.

59:02.414 --> 59:04.782
And three, the Arctic economy
is a barter system

59:04.784 --> 59:07.885
largely consisting of meat, vegetables,
and the occasional tchotchke.

59:07.887 --> 59:10.720
So, in short, it means
they're flat broke.

59:10.722 --> 59:13.157
And, that's where I come in.

59:13.159 --> 59:16.394
I am the richest hare
in the entire world.

59:16.396 --> 59:19.130
I own over 1,000 bars of gold!

59:19.132 --> 59:22.165
I get a haircut
and massage every day.

59:22.167 --> 59:24.667
I fly in my own
chef from Beijing

59:24.669 --> 59:27.536
to make my dim sum from scratch.

59:27.538 --> 59:30.540
I sleep on the highest thread
count sheets known to man.

59:30.542 --> 59:32.875
Okay, we get it.
You're rich.

59:32.877 --> 59:35.911
Rich? No. <i>Very</i> rich!

59:35.913 --> 59:38.580
And I will fund the team.

59:38.582 --> 59:41.417
Okay, that settles that!

59:41.419 --> 59:44.755
I'll get a news crew
and book a trip up north!

01:00:08.944 --> 01:00:09.979
Quinn!

01:00:13.750 --> 01:00:15.616
Great to see you again!

01:00:15.618 --> 01:00:17.185
Let me show you my home.

01:00:17.187 --> 01:00:19.089
We stocked our
fridge for you this time!

01:00:23.092 --> 01:00:27.994
I think that is Fong, the
wealthiest animal in the world.

01:00:27.996 --> 01:00:30.531
Is he backing their team?

01:00:30.533 --> 01:00:32.132
I can hear you!

01:00:32.134 --> 01:00:34.968
These big ears serve
a purpose, you know.

01:00:34.970 --> 01:00:37.002
And yes, I am Fong,

01:00:37.004 --> 01:00:39.004
and yes, I am
backing their team...

01:00:39.006 --> 01:00:43.146
and yes, I am the richest
animal in the world!

01:00:44.546 --> 01:00:47.481
I do not like that little bunny.

01:00:47.483 --> 01:00:48.714
I'm a hare!

01:00:48.716 --> 01:00:50.852
And I can still hear you!

01:00:54.722 --> 01:00:56.956
Okay, this is perfect.

01:00:56.958 --> 01:00:59.657
We'll use this photo for
marketing and branding.

01:00:59.659 --> 01:01:02.260
We'll make hockey cards,
action figures.

01:01:02.262 --> 01:01:05.498
This picture will
be on cereal boxes.

01:01:05.500 --> 01:01:07.766
The sky's the limit!

01:01:07.768 --> 01:01:10.536
These mangy beasts have it all.

01:01:10.538 --> 01:01:12.036
Marketing. Money.

01:01:12.038 --> 01:01:13.873
They even have cheerleaders!

01:01:13.875 --> 01:01:16.878
This might not be
as easy as I thought.

01:01:18.712 --> 01:01:22.546
Da, but boss,
they are just silly animal.

01:01:22.548 --> 01:01:24.617
We're from Taknekistan!

01:01:28.854 --> 01:01:31.055
They also have a star.

01:01:31.057 --> 01:01:34.591
His ability scares me.
He's too good.

01:01:34.593 --> 01:01:36.593
He reminds me of your brother.

01:01:36.595 --> 01:01:38.863
Yes. They are similar.

01:01:38.865 --> 01:01:41.633
They both only
care about themselves.

01:01:41.635 --> 01:01:43.736
No "team".

01:01:45.538 --> 01:01:47.974
We can use that.

01:01:51.175 --> 01:01:53.809
Fong! There you are!

01:01:53.811 --> 01:01:56.045
Oh, I missed you!

01:01:56.047 --> 01:01:58.548
Norm, I'm very proud of you.

01:01:58.550 --> 01:02:02.019
Challenging the humans was
a very brave thing to do.

01:02:02.021 --> 01:02:06.693
Just be sure to remind your team
that they are playing for their home.

01:02:08.325 --> 01:02:10.759
So, are you ready
for the big day, Norm?

01:02:10.761 --> 01:02:13.930
Just be sure to remind the team
that they're playing for their home.

01:02:13.932 --> 01:02:16.265
Yeah, he knows.

01:02:16.267 --> 01:02:19.000
I gave him that little nugget of
advice, just before you got here.

01:02:19.002 --> 01:02:20.602
And who are you then?

01:02:20.604 --> 01:02:22.837
And who are <i>you</i> then? Then?

01:02:22.839 --> 01:02:24.973
I asked first, okay?

01:02:24.975 --> 01:02:28.076
Socrates, this is Fong,
one of my friends from New York.

01:02:28.078 --> 01:02:31.580
Fong this is Socrates,
he's my advisor.

01:02:31.582 --> 01:02:35.784
Yeah, hear that, Fong?
I'm his advisor.

01:02:35.786 --> 01:02:38.619
Meaning, I advise him on

01:02:38.621 --> 01:02:41.822
many, many, many,
many matters, yes.

01:02:41.824 --> 01:02:44.258
Well, I'm his advisor, too.

01:02:44.260 --> 01:02:47.862
Since you know,
I'm kind of "the advice guy."

01:02:47.864 --> 01:02:49.863
That's kinda like, my thing.

01:02:49.865 --> 01:02:51.766
Oh, is it really?

01:02:51.768 --> 01:02:54.836
Well, that's odd because
I am the advice guy!

01:02:54.838 --> 01:02:56.603
- Really?
- Really!

01:02:56.605 --> 01:02:58.973
- Really!
- Really!

01:02:58.975 --> 01:03:02.042
Whoa, fellas! Fellas! Relax.

01:03:02.044 --> 01:03:03.911
These days I need
all the advice I can get

01:03:03.913 --> 01:03:06.346
so you can both
be my advice guys.

01:03:06.348 --> 01:03:09.049
Hmm.

01:03:11.988 --> 01:03:14.154
Okay, little guys.
I'll talk to him.

01:03:14.156 --> 01:03:16.993
Stan! Can I have a word, please?

01:03:18.893 --> 01:03:23.296
Just pumpin' some iron,
before the game. Yeah.

01:03:23.298 --> 01:03:25.331
What can I do for
you, little bro?

01:03:25.333 --> 01:03:28.635
You're actually my little
brother. I'm older, remember?

01:03:28.637 --> 01:03:31.003
I wanted to talk to
you about your game.

01:03:31.005 --> 01:03:34.640
There's no "I" in team.
Or in country, actually.

01:03:34.642 --> 01:03:36.809
- And your country is your team.
- Hey!

01:03:36.811 --> 01:03:38.378
The lemmings have
been complaining.

01:03:38.380 --> 01:03:40.747
And they don't complain about
anything!

01:03:40.749 --> 01:03:42.048
If we want to win, you're
going to have to pass the puck.

01:03:42.050 --> 01:03:44.281
Oh, you're right.

01:03:44.283 --> 01:03:47.685
I'm gonna listen to you,
but only because

01:03:47.687 --> 01:03:51.288
you're the best hockey
player in the world.

01:03:51.290 --> 01:03:55.661
Oh wait, never mind!
That's me! Ha ha ha!

01:03:55.663 --> 01:03:57.962
<i>I'm</i> the best hockey player
in the world!

01:03:57.964 --> 01:03:59.864
Ha ha ha! Ah,

01:03:59.866 --> 01:04:02.199
probably best to leave
the hockey coaching to me.

01:04:02.201 --> 01:04:04.171
Ha ha ha ha!

01:04:07.975 --> 01:04:10.173
The team looks good, Norm.

01:04:10.175 --> 01:04:14.010
But I would advise you to
help Stan play for his home

01:04:14.012 --> 01:04:15.946
instead of himself.

01:04:15.948 --> 01:04:19.716
I know, I just talked to him
about it, but he didn't like it.

01:04:19.718 --> 01:04:22.852
Norm, I want to talk to
you about your brother.

01:04:22.854 --> 01:04:24.789
He's not a team player.

01:04:24.791 --> 01:04:27.457
He needs to play for his home,
instead of himself.

01:04:27.459 --> 01:04:30.294
He knows. I just told him.

01:04:30.296 --> 01:04:34.197
Oh, of course you did! Ugh!

01:04:34.199 --> 01:04:36.866
Okay. Don't forget,
during the game tomorrow

01:04:36.868 --> 01:04:39.034
when in doubt,
pass me the puck.

01:04:39.036 --> 01:04:42.905
Okay guys, let's break up into
groups and work on our passing.

01:04:42.907 --> 01:04:46.342
Visualize passing
the puck...

01:04:46.344 --> 01:04:47.777
to me!

01:04:47.779 --> 01:04:49.114
Psst! Hey, bear.

01:04:56.086 --> 01:04:59.821
- You know who this is, right?
- Uh-huh.

01:04:59.823 --> 01:05:05.160
Benny Voulanov is a household name,
thanks to all of his endorsements.

01:05:05.162 --> 01:05:08.162
Would you like to
be just as famous?

01:05:08.164 --> 01:05:10.134
Uh-huh.

01:05:12.169 --> 01:05:16.174
Da. Then meet me over by
the ship in five minutes.

01:05:19.477 --> 01:05:22.744
On second thought, guys, I
think that's enough for tonight.

01:05:22.746 --> 01:05:25.146
Well, we don't want to
burn ourselves out for tomorrow.

01:05:25.148 --> 01:05:27.217
Everyone can go home.

01:05:33.489 --> 01:05:35.155
Stan will come around.

01:05:35.157 --> 01:05:37.257
He's just excited
that he's good.

01:05:37.259 --> 01:05:38.760
I think you're right.

01:05:38.762 --> 01:05:40.327
I know my brother.

01:05:40.329 --> 01:05:42.195
He always ends up
doing the right thing.

01:05:42.197 --> 01:05:44.263
Dad, look at this!

01:05:44.265 --> 01:05:47.234
Norm, Your brother's
in a Far North commercial!

01:05:47.236 --> 01:05:52.071
That is why we get our
H2Os from North Poles.

01:05:52.073 --> 01:05:54.774
Does not get
more pure than this.

01:05:54.776 --> 01:05:56.445
Am I right?

01:05:57.412 --> 01:05:58.511
Ah!

01:05:58.513 --> 01:06:01.049
So much delicious.

01:06:02.517 --> 01:06:04.884
Ha ha ha! Hey!

01:06:04.886 --> 01:06:06.321
What the...?

01:06:22.003 --> 01:06:24.135
I'm a star. I'm a star.

01:06:24.137 --> 01:06:26.104
I'm a star. I'm a star.

01:06:26.106 --> 01:06:29.008
I'm a big, bright, shining star.

01:06:29.010 --> 01:06:32.944
Welcome to the Frozen Pond
for the first ever hockey game

01:06:32.946 --> 01:06:35.245
between animals and humans,

01:06:35.247 --> 01:06:38.149
the first
in a best-of-three series!

01:06:38.151 --> 01:06:43.254
The Arctic All-Stars, led by
the king's kid brother, Stan,

01:06:43.256 --> 01:06:47.458
against the fearsome workers
from Taknekistan!

01:06:47.460 --> 01:06:50.328
Hello and welcome, folks.

01:06:50.330 --> 01:06:54.866
I'm Jim Caribou,
and this is my colleague, Rick.

01:06:54.868 --> 01:06:58.869
It's animals versus humans
in what people are calling...

01:06:58.871 --> 01:07:00.539
They're callin' it, uh...

01:07:02.041 --> 01:07:05.108
What happened to the cue cards?

01:07:05.110 --> 01:07:08.010
Oh, no...
What are we gonna do, Jim?

01:07:08.012 --> 01:07:10.981
We'll do it live, Rick!
We'll do it live!

01:07:10.983 --> 01:07:14.852
Doin'er live, Jim!
Doin'er live!

01:07:14.854 --> 01:07:16.419
What did that Caribou
just say?

01:07:16.421 --> 01:07:18.521
I'm pretty sure
he just said...

01:07:32.036 --> 01:07:33.569
Whoo-hoo!

01:07:33.571 --> 01:07:34.904
Ha ha ha!

01:07:34.906 --> 01:07:36.174
Yeah!

01:07:38.109 --> 01:07:39.411
Yeah.

01:07:41.913 --> 01:07:44.044
We love hockey!

01:07:44.046 --> 01:07:45.946
We love hockey!

01:07:45.948 --> 01:07:47.182
We love hockey!

01:07:47.184 --> 01:07:49.149
We love hockey!

01:07:49.151 --> 01:07:51.452
What is this?
We agreed to play

01:07:51.454 --> 01:07:53.053
your workers,
not your National team.

01:07:53.055 --> 01:07:54.521
This is rigged!

01:07:54.523 --> 01:07:57.591
Oh, Norm, you see,
the thing is,

01:07:57.593 --> 01:08:00.562
my company employs
all of these players.

01:08:00.564 --> 01:08:03.932
They are on contract
with Far North Water.

01:08:03.934 --> 01:08:06.468
Did I not mention that?

01:08:09.337 --> 01:08:11.207
Oops.

01:08:15.043 --> 01:08:17.111
Well, this wasn't
part of the plan,

01:08:17.113 --> 01:08:19.647
- but, uh, we got this.
- Huh?

01:08:22.350 --> 01:08:24.919
That's it. I'm out.
We're gonna get crushed.

01:08:26.555 --> 01:08:28.554
I can't stop these
guys. They're big.

01:08:28.555 --> 01:08:30.624
They're angry.
They're Taknekians.

01:08:30.626 --> 01:08:32.658
Guys! Guys!
Have some faith!

01:08:32.661 --> 01:08:34.560
All we have to do is...

01:08:34.562 --> 01:08:37.099
Count on me.
I got this, bro.

01:08:48.242 --> 01:08:50.475
I'm open, Uncle Stan. I'm open!

01:08:50.478 --> 01:08:53.314
Relax. I got this!

01:08:54.515 --> 01:08:56.279
Whoa!

01:08:56.282 --> 01:08:58.283
Oh!
He got kicked do hard

01:08:58.285 --> 01:08:59.319
it untied his skates.

01:09:01.120 --> 01:09:03.020
Heh... Ahh.

01:09:03.022 --> 01:09:05.256
Top shelf where Mama
hides the tundra cookies!

01:09:05.258 --> 01:09:07.361
I knew she did, Jim.

01:09:09.029 --> 01:09:11.095
We love hockey!

01:09:11.096 --> 01:09:13.163
We love hockey!

01:09:13.166 --> 01:09:15.634
Hey, cap, look for Maria.
She's open on the wing.

01:09:15.636 --> 01:09:17.667
Until you can stop
a single shot,

01:09:17.670 --> 01:09:20.439
why don't you let me handle
the strategy there, Mick.

01:09:24.644 --> 01:09:27.211
Stan passes it to...
Oh no. Hold on.

01:09:27.212 --> 01:09:29.612
Nope, he's not passing
it to anyone.

01:09:29.613 --> 01:09:33.017
Interesting strategy here from
the king's brother there, Jim.

01:09:33.019 --> 01:09:35.318
Holding onto the puck
until it gets taken away.

01:09:35.319 --> 01:09:37.554
Interesting stuff.

01:09:38.991 --> 01:09:40.224
Arggh.

01:09:40.225 --> 01:09:41.495
Ha ha ha hey!

01:09:43.495 --> 01:09:45.131
Hmph.

01:09:54.773 --> 01:10:00.043
We love hockey!
We love hockey! We love...

01:10:00.045 --> 01:10:03.312
Dad, he didn't pass
the puck once!

01:10:03.314 --> 01:10:05.447
Why should I pass
if I'm the best player?

01:10:06.685 --> 01:10:09.485
Exactly! It's a team!

01:10:13.724 --> 01:10:15.324
That's enough!

01:10:15.326 --> 01:10:17.392
If Uncle Stan
doesn't start

01:10:17.394 --> 01:10:19.061
letting other people
play with him,

01:10:19.063 --> 01:10:20.495
then I'm gonna quit.

01:10:20.497 --> 01:10:22.564
Me, too.

01:10:22.566 --> 01:10:24.700
Stan, let the
others play as well.

01:10:24.702 --> 01:10:26.802
This isn't about you.
It's about our home.

01:10:26.804 --> 01:10:32.039
Oh, now The Great King Norm
is taking over hockey too, huh?

01:10:32.041 --> 01:10:33.740
You couldn't let me
have this one, could you?

01:10:33.742 --> 01:10:35.409
Everything has to be about you!

01:10:35.411 --> 01:10:37.244
What are you talking about?

01:10:37.246 --> 01:10:39.079
This is the first time
in my life

01:10:39.081 --> 01:10:40.782
I've been the best
at something!

01:10:40.784 --> 01:10:42.816
The first time in my life
I've had my own thing!

01:10:42.818 --> 01:10:45.319
You ran the shows
for tourists for years

01:10:45.321 --> 01:10:47.087
and loved every minute of it!

01:10:47.089 --> 01:10:48.189
That's not the point!

01:10:48.191 --> 01:10:50.358
Then what is, Stan?!

01:10:53.530 --> 01:10:56.563
You're the king,
the great hero.

01:10:56.565 --> 01:11:00.067
"Oh, look at Norm.
He's amazing!"

01:11:00.069 --> 01:11:04.336
Well, I'm amazing at hockey,
so deal with it!

01:11:04.338 --> 01:11:08.443
We're gonna lose our home
if you don't do something, Dad.

01:11:11.146 --> 01:11:13.846
You heard him, he refuses
to play with the other animals.

01:11:13.848 --> 01:11:15.381
And he seems to be
really mad at me.

01:11:15.383 --> 01:11:17.216
I don't want
to lose my brother.

01:11:17.218 --> 01:11:19.852
Well, you can't lose
your home either, Norm.

01:11:19.854 --> 01:11:23.289
The rest of the Arctic
depends on you, not just Stan.

01:11:23.291 --> 01:11:25.790
You're right.
We need a new coach,

01:11:25.792 --> 01:11:27.625
but I don't know anything
about the sport!

01:11:27.627 --> 01:11:31.097
Norm, I thought
you'd never ask.

01:11:31.099 --> 01:11:35.134
- I would be honored to ...-
- Okay, okay.

01:11:35.136 --> 01:11:36.634
I will coach the team.

01:11:36.636 --> 01:11:39.671
You will?
Fong, you're a lifesaver!

01:11:39.673 --> 01:11:41.573
You know everything
about hockey!

01:11:41.575 --> 01:11:44.412
Oh, thank you, thank you,
thank you, thank you!

01:11:46.580 --> 01:11:50.251
Well. I guess I'll just
go pluck myself.

01:11:55.122 --> 01:11:56.620
You wanted to see me?

01:11:56.622 --> 01:11:59.824
Stan, I know you're
upset right now.

01:11:59.826 --> 01:12:04.428
And I'm sorry if I ever did anything
to make you feel... less than me.

01:12:04.430 --> 01:12:08.664
It's funny. I spent most
of my life jealous of <i>you.</i>

01:12:08.666 --> 01:12:10.601
Really?

01:12:10.603 --> 01:12:12.535
Well, you were Dad's favorite.

01:12:12.537 --> 01:12:15.172
You did the big shows,
you didn't speak human.

01:12:15.174 --> 01:12:18.342
Point is, I know what it's like
to feel like you don't belong...

01:12:18.344 --> 01:12:20.209
or you're not good enough.

01:12:20.211 --> 01:12:22.178
But you <i>are</i> good enough.

01:12:22.180 --> 01:12:24.815
You're the best I've ever seen
out there on the ice.

01:12:24.817 --> 01:12:28.418
But you can't be coach anymore.
Please understand.

01:12:28.420 --> 01:12:30.287
You need to learn
to play for our home,

01:12:30.289 --> 01:12:32.387
and the team needs
someone else to guide them.

01:12:32.389 --> 01:12:34.524
I'm fired?

01:12:34.526 --> 01:12:36.259
Only from coaching.

01:12:36.261 --> 01:12:38.461
We all still want
you to play. Okay?

01:12:38.463 --> 01:12:41.633
This is a big mistake.
You'll see!

01:12:47.205 --> 01:12:48.436
Stan is no longer coach.

01:12:48.438 --> 01:12:49.572
Thank goodness.

01:12:49.574 --> 01:12:51.506
'Bout time.

01:12:51.508 --> 01:12:55.411
May I present the new coach,
the Hockey Hare, Fong!

01:12:55.413 --> 01:12:57.379
Thank you, King Norm.

01:12:57.381 --> 01:13:00.682
Players, I have
a simple philosophy.

01:13:00.684 --> 01:13:02.651
This is your home.

01:13:02.653 --> 01:13:07.288
You all live here and together
you will fight for it!

01:13:07.290 --> 01:13:08.889
Yeah.

01:13:08.891 --> 01:13:12.394
So, pass often, put
the puck in the net,

01:13:12.396 --> 01:13:14.362
and let's win this thing!

01:13:14.364 --> 01:13:15.897
Yeah!!

01:13:15.899 --> 01:13:18.433
That was just
on the tip of my beak, actually.

01:13:18.435 --> 01:13:20.433
No deal!

01:13:20.435 --> 01:13:23.204
Why should the good player
share with the bad players?

01:13:23.206 --> 01:13:24.470
That is stupid.

01:13:24.472 --> 01:13:26.839
Then <i>you</i> will not play.

01:13:26.841 --> 01:13:28.808
You will sit on the bench.

01:13:28.810 --> 01:13:30.376
Wait! Fong...

01:13:30.378 --> 01:13:33.214
Excuse me? I'm the best!

01:13:33.216 --> 01:13:38.251
There is no room for a showboat
or puck hog on my team...

01:13:38.253 --> 01:13:40.888
only players willing to pass.

01:13:40.890 --> 01:13:42.559
Quinn, you are up!

01:13:44.725 --> 01:13:46.362
Hmph!

01:13:47.996 --> 01:13:51.864
Well, Rick, Game Two,
and the atmosphere is electric!

01:13:51.866 --> 01:13:54.700
I don't know, she looks
dead calm to me, there, Jim.

01:13:54.702 --> 01:13:56.668
You're facing the wrong way,
Rick. Turn around.

01:13:56.670 --> 01:13:58.870
Turning around now, Jim.

01:13:58.872 --> 01:14:00.709
Yay!

01:14:03.612 --> 01:14:07.247
Their best player
is not playing,

01:14:07.249 --> 01:14:10.282
so this should be easy.

01:14:10.284 --> 01:14:13.921
Let's shred them like
cabbage in borscht!

01:14:15.723 --> 01:14:17.788
Maria passes over
to one of the seals.

01:14:17.790 --> 01:14:21.260
The seal to, uh,
his seal partner.

01:14:21.262 --> 01:14:24.199
Yeah man, these seals really
need names there, Jim.

01:14:26.967 --> 01:14:28.667
Hmm.

01:14:28.669 --> 01:14:29.900
Argh!

01:14:34.473 --> 01:14:35.942
Ow!

01:14:52.991 --> 01:14:54.724
Huh?

01:14:54.726 --> 01:14:57.893
Yesterday,
this team was divided.

01:14:57.895 --> 01:15:00.330
Today, they are united.

01:15:00.332 --> 01:15:01.697
I don't like this.

01:15:01.699 --> 01:15:03.767
We must stop them.

01:15:03.769 --> 01:15:07.370
We are bringing
in the National team.

01:15:07.372 --> 01:15:11.040
But boss, this <i>is</i>
our national team, no?

01:15:11.042 --> 01:15:16.345
The <i>real</i> national team, the
ones that won us all the medals.

01:15:16.347 --> 01:15:19.583
There is no other option.

01:15:21.018 --> 01:15:23.852
Whoo-hoo!
We are one game away.

01:15:23.854 --> 01:15:26.821
We can do this.
We can defeat these guys.

01:15:26.823 --> 01:15:28.824
Remember what we
are playing for!

01:15:28.826 --> 01:15:30.592
Our home!

01:15:30.594 --> 01:15:32.593
That was my advice.

01:15:32.595 --> 01:15:35.364
I have something I need to say.

01:15:35.366 --> 01:15:38.366
I was selfish. I was stupid.

01:15:38.368 --> 01:15:40.535
And I almost ruined
it for everyone.

01:15:40.537 --> 01:15:43.004
But you guys bailed me out.

01:15:43.006 --> 01:15:45.605
I lost sight of
what's important.

01:15:45.607 --> 01:15:48.876
I thought sponsorships
are what makes a bear great.

01:15:48.878 --> 01:15:52.379
I started blow-drying my fur,
for Pete's sake!

01:15:52.381 --> 01:15:54.382
But I was wrong.

01:15:54.384 --> 01:15:56.383
That's why I'm turning down
my sponsorships!

01:15:59.688 --> 01:16:04.092
All in favor for Stan playing
in the game tomorrow, say aye.

01:16:04.094 --> 01:16:06.461
Aye!

01:16:06.463 --> 01:16:08.028
Thank you!

01:16:08.030 --> 01:16:11.364
Now, I think we all know
what we need to do:

01:16:11.366 --> 01:16:13.567
Save our home!

01:16:17.606 --> 01:16:19.706
I'm all for saving
our home, guys,

01:16:19.708 --> 01:16:22.842
but we don't have a goalie!
I hurt my hoof!

01:16:22.844 --> 01:16:28.414
Well, I nominate the toughest,
coolest, bravest,

01:16:28.416 --> 01:16:31.884
most royalest, regalest,
kingly-est bear I know.

01:16:31.886 --> 01:16:34.085
Uh... who?

01:16:34.087 --> 01:16:35.888
You, Norm!

01:16:35.890 --> 01:16:37.956
But I'm no athlete, Stan.
You know that!

01:16:37.958 --> 01:16:40.725
Norm, those who
live in the Arctic

01:16:40.727 --> 01:16:43.595
need to be the ones
who fight for our home.

01:16:43.597 --> 01:16:47.099
There's no one better to fight
for it than you... our king!

01:16:47.101 --> 01:16:50.568
I see what you
did there, brother.

01:16:50.570 --> 01:16:52.638
You used my words against me.

01:16:52.640 --> 01:16:54.407
Wow.

01:16:54.409 --> 01:16:56.708
But I guess you're right.
Okay, I'm in!

01:17:03.082 --> 01:17:07.084
Game Three here, Rick,
for all the marbles!

01:17:07.086 --> 01:17:09.687
And for control
of the Arctic there, Jim.

01:17:09.689 --> 01:17:11.525
That's what I meant, Rick.

01:17:15.528 --> 01:17:17.964
Benny Voulanov!

01:17:20.099 --> 01:17:22.598
We will crush you.

01:17:22.600 --> 01:17:24.735
N-Not if we
crush you first.

01:17:24.737 --> 01:17:29.539
I'm sorry,
I don't speak... Bear.

01:17:37.916 --> 01:17:40.450
Uhh! Ahh!

01:17:40.452 --> 01:17:41.985
Ahhh!

01:17:47.525 --> 01:17:48.727
Grrr!

01:17:49.827 --> 01:17:51.894
Uhh!

01:17:51.896 --> 01:17:54.029
Oh! That's another biscuit

01:17:54.031 --> 01:17:56.966
in the basket for Taknekistan.

01:17:56.968 --> 01:17:59.668
You, seal, pass it
to the... other seal.

01:17:59.670 --> 01:18:01.503
No, not that seal.

01:18:01.505 --> 01:18:03.575
Y'know, you seals
really need names.

01:18:05.242 --> 01:18:07.242
- Huh?
- Hahh!

01:18:15.252 --> 01:18:18.689
Hmm. Something's not right here.

01:18:26.730 --> 01:18:28.897
I knew it!

01:18:28.899 --> 01:18:31.965
Lemmings, over here!

01:18:34.270 --> 01:18:37.938
Well, folks, it's the end
of the second period

01:18:37.940 --> 01:18:41.908
and it looks like Taknekistan
has regained their mojo.

01:18:41.910 --> 01:18:45.144
They lead the Arctic All-Stars
three to nothin'.

01:18:45.146 --> 01:18:49.950
One more period until they're the
rightful owners of this big chunk of ice.

01:18:49.952 --> 01:18:51.951
Or, should we say,
big chunk

01:18:51.953 --> 01:18:54.522
of soon-to-be drinkin'
water there, Jim!

01:18:54.524 --> 01:18:57.726
- No Rick, just say "ice".
- "Ice" it is, Jim!

01:19:01.830 --> 01:19:03.730
It's not over yet, guys.

01:19:03.732 --> 01:19:06.766
Just remember,
if I can change,

01:19:06.768 --> 01:19:09.802
then you can change...
everyone can change!

01:19:09.804 --> 01:19:11.737
Yeah!

01:19:11.739 --> 01:19:14.973
But first, I need to
sit down for a sec

01:19:14.975 --> 01:19:17.110
and catch my breath.

01:19:17.112 --> 01:19:19.544
Dad! Dad!

01:19:19.546 --> 01:19:21.613
The other team is robotic!

01:19:21.615 --> 01:19:25.083
Now son, that's a crude,
outdated stereotype.

01:19:25.085 --> 01:19:27.151
Sure, these guys are severe,

01:19:27.153 --> 01:19:29.555
they don't show their emotions
like us animals do,

01:19:29.557 --> 01:19:32.958
but they have feelings
somewhere....under there.

01:19:32.960 --> 01:19:35.927
No, I mean literally,
they're robots!

01:19:35.929 --> 01:19:38.730
And I think we can use
the lemmings to expose them!

01:19:38.732 --> 01:19:40.599
Hmm.

01:19:40.601 --> 01:19:42.903
Okay, it's worth a shot.
Let's do it.

01:19:57.850 --> 01:20:00.051
Huh?

01:20:00.053 --> 01:20:03.854
Ow!
You bit me, you rodent!

01:20:07.693 --> 01:20:10.059
Voulanov, it's
just like I thought.

01:20:10.061 --> 01:20:11.827
Your team is fake!

01:20:13.332 --> 01:20:16.131
It is small technicality.

01:20:16.133 --> 01:20:21.140
You animals would never be
beating us, no matter what.

01:20:22.341 --> 01:20:25.241
- Oh yeah?
- Oh yeah.

01:20:25.243 --> 01:20:27.309
Three on three.
Right now.

01:20:27.311 --> 01:20:29.312
Me, my brother,
and my daughter

01:20:29.314 --> 01:20:32.615
against you, your brother,
and...

01:20:32.617 --> 01:20:33.818
that guy!

01:20:34.784 --> 01:20:36.050
Who, me?

01:20:36.052 --> 01:20:38.786
You want to play me and Benny?

01:20:38.788 --> 01:20:42.594
Ha! You are on!

01:20:46.963 --> 01:20:50.031
Maybe this was a mistake.
I stink at hockey.

01:20:50.033 --> 01:20:52.634
Even Rigoberto would've been
better than me.

01:20:52.636 --> 01:20:55.637
Don't worry, Dad,
Uncle Stan and I got this.

01:20:55.639 --> 01:20:58.705
We play well together now.
Right, Uncle Stan?

01:20:58.707 --> 01:21:00.374
Bingo!

01:21:00.376 --> 01:21:03.744
Norm, I am your brother,
and you're my brother.

01:21:03.746 --> 01:21:05.946
We're a small band of brothers.

01:21:05.948 --> 01:21:07.781
We have brotherly love.

01:21:07.783 --> 01:21:09.717
And we're gonna
brother so hard right now,

01:21:09.719 --> 01:21:12.720
we're gonna save the Arctic!

01:21:12.722 --> 01:21:15.692
Yeah, brother!
Let's go get 'em!

01:21:20.161 --> 01:21:23.063
I want a clean game out
of you guys, ya hear me?

01:21:23.065 --> 01:21:24.898
No funny business.

01:21:24.900 --> 01:21:27.367
First goal wins the Arctic.

01:21:27.369 --> 01:21:29.706
Ready? Go!

01:21:38.112 --> 01:21:39.781
Ha ha ha!

01:21:47.055 --> 01:21:48.787
Waaah!

01:21:48.789 --> 01:21:51.659
Norm, Norm,
bringin' the storm!

01:21:52.959 --> 01:21:54.730
Bleaahh!

01:22:09.909 --> 01:22:13.044
She shoots, she scores!

01:22:16.917 --> 01:22:19.750
Well, shave my face
with a rusty razor!

01:22:19.752 --> 01:22:23.220
I sure could use a hamburger
right now, Jim!

01:22:23.222 --> 01:22:25.790
No! No!

01:22:25.792 --> 01:22:27.791
How could this happen?

01:22:27.793 --> 01:22:30.361
I do not understand!

01:22:30.363 --> 01:22:33.429
I... am not surprised.

01:22:33.431 --> 01:22:35.966
What is that supposed to mean?

01:22:35.968 --> 01:22:39.469
Those animals were
fighting for their home...

01:22:39.471 --> 01:22:42.839
they, themselves...
no one else.

01:22:42.841 --> 01:22:44.807
They deserved this win.

01:22:44.809 --> 01:22:49.045
I will be challenging
you to a rematching!

01:22:49.047 --> 01:22:53.283
Actually, I just got word from
the Nation Games Commissioner

01:22:53.285 --> 01:22:57.252
you won't be challenging anyone
to a rematch anytime soon.

01:22:57.254 --> 01:23:00.222
Because of your cheating,
the nation of Taknekistan

01:23:00.224 --> 01:23:02.091
will be stripped
of all their medals

01:23:02.093 --> 01:23:05.798
and banned from
The Nation Games for five years!

01:23:07.464 --> 01:23:10.435
We love hockey!
We love hockey!

01:23:11.969 --> 01:23:14.169
You give good advice, Fong.

01:23:14.171 --> 01:23:16.004
I respect you.

01:23:16.006 --> 01:23:18.173
Thank you for helping us
save the Arctic.

01:23:18.175 --> 01:23:21.275
No-no, you give
good advice Socrates.

01:23:21.277 --> 01:23:24.345
I will take advice
from you anytime.

01:23:24.347 --> 01:23:27.381
We love hockey!
We love hockey!

01:23:27.383 --> 01:23:29.252
<i>We love hockey!</i>

01:23:33.322 --> 01:23:35.823
<i>She shoots, she scores!</i>

01:23:35.825 --> 01:23:37.360
<i>We love hockey!</i>

01:23:45.333 --> 01:23:48.835
Wow, it's gonna take these workers
days to replace all this ice

01:23:48.837 --> 01:23:50.474
and clean up all the machines.

01:23:51.908 --> 01:23:54.077
I have an idea.

01:24:04.386 --> 01:24:08.056
Just reprogram them.
You can thank me later.

01:24:26.408 --> 01:24:30.476
Congratulations, Norm.
You did it. You saved your home!

01:24:30.478 --> 01:24:34.378
Ahem! Excuse me.
What am I, chopped liver?

01:24:34.380 --> 01:24:37.216
Huh?
Sorry, I don't speak bear.

01:24:37.218 --> 01:24:40.252
He wants some credit.

01:24:40.254 --> 01:24:43.454
Okay, you too, Stan.
You saved the Arctic, too.

01:24:45.158 --> 01:24:47.292
<i>That's</i> more like it!
