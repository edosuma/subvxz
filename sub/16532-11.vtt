WEBVTT

00:00.001 --> 00:03.469
Can I have that dropped
at the gift table for you?

00:03.471 --> 00:05.771
Ah, I think I'll hang onto this.
This is a special gift.

00:05.773 --> 00:08.841
It's a wine fridge --
36 bottles, stainless steel,

00:08.843 --> 00:10.943
dual temp zones for your whites,
your reds.

00:10.945 --> 00:13.278
She doesn't care. Okay.
And neither did the priest.

00:13.280 --> 00:14.613
Father o'godhe'shot.

00:14.615 --> 00:16.615
-I know. Those lips, right?
-Hey, hey, hey.

00:16.617 --> 00:18.450
Is that appropriate?
-Appropriate?

00:18.452 --> 00:19.651
You never carried us around
as proudly

00:19.653 --> 00:21.120
as you're carrying
around <i> that</i> thing.

00:21.122 --> 00:24.623
30 years ago, I didn't do your
aunt Becky's closets for free.

00:24.625 --> 00:27.326
The whole family got together
and decided I was cheap --

00:27.328 --> 00:28.794
called me "high pockets."

00:28.796 --> 00:30.696
Well, we'll see what her boy
Brian says

00:30.698 --> 00:33.332
when he opens what
<i> esquire magazine</i> called

00:33.334 --> 00:36.201
"the last under-counter
wine fridge you'll ever need."

00:36.203 --> 00:37.202
Wow.

00:37.204 --> 00:39.705
(Both laugh)
High pockets.

00:39.707 --> 00:41.473
Can we just find the bar?

00:41.475 --> 00:42.808
How funny would it be
if I said no?

00:42.810 --> 00:44.343
(Laughs)

00:44.345 --> 00:45.811
Mother of...Us.

00:45.813 --> 00:47.046
Mom!
What is she doing here?

00:47.048 --> 00:48.847
She's not even related
to these people!

00:48.849 --> 00:50.149
Oh, my god.

00:50.151 --> 00:52.317
You, me, mom, dad, alone.

00:52.319 --> 00:54.153
Without Gloria
to absorb the hate.

00:54.155 --> 00:56.355
Okay, why am I scared?
I'm feeling scared.

00:56.357 --> 00:58.524
Because you are flashing back
to every family event

00:58.526 --> 01:00.492
that ended with dad
whisper-screaming at mom,

01:00.494 --> 01:02.861
"would you calm down?" While
she would swing her pocketbook

01:02.863 --> 01:05.831
around until it burst open
like a pill-packed piñata.

01:05.833 --> 01:08.867
Oh, god. I-i don't want to be
the make-a-scene family. Again.

01:08.869 --> 01:11.503
Well, dad's not leaving
until they award him CNN hero

01:11.505 --> 01:12.738
for bringing
the wine fridge,

01:12.740 --> 01:14.206
so maybe we just each
take a parent

01:14.208 --> 01:16.175
and try and keep them apart
as much as possible?

01:16.177 --> 01:18.744
Probably our best shot
at an uneventful day.

01:18.746 --> 01:21.180
But can we please not fight over
who has to care of --

01:21.182 --> 01:23.415
(as Mitchell) Mom!

01:23.417 --> 01:24.416
-Mitchell!
-Hey!

01:24.418 --> 01:25.684
(Chuckling) Hi.

01:25.686 --> 01:29.521
Oh, it's so good
to see you, honey. Mm!

01:29.523 --> 01:33.325
--<font color="#ffff00"> Captions by vitac</font> --

01:43.203 --> 01:45.404
hey. I got us a campus map,
and look at this --

01:45.406 --> 01:47.873
my old college frat
has a chapter here!

01:47.875 --> 01:49.575
By legacy rights,
I'm entitled

01:49.577 --> 01:52.044
to use the main-floor bathroom
and sign out a frisbee.

01:52.046 --> 01:53.378
Cool.

01:53.380 --> 01:55.214
Wow, you're really giving
those bands a workout.

01:55.216 --> 01:57.549
Oh, just burning off
some nervous energy.

01:57.551 --> 02:00.052
They don't ask questions
on a college tour, right?

02:00.054 --> 02:03.455
Luke and I, Gloria, and Manny
are going on a college tour!

02:03.457 --> 02:06.592
Safety school for Manny,
long shot for Luke,

02:06.594 --> 02:08.794
which hasn't been great
for his self-esteem.

02:08.795 --> 02:10.229
Luckily, as a former
cheerleader,

02:10.231 --> 02:13.065
I haven't lost my gift
for lifting spirits.

02:13.067 --> 02:16.235
Though I can no longer make an n
with my body.

02:16.237 --> 02:17.970
Wow.

02:17.972 --> 02:19.271
This is a great workout.

02:19.273 --> 02:20.572
Ow! No!

02:20.574 --> 02:22.074
Sorry, sorry!
Guys, come look!

02:22.076 --> 02:24.143
I did something very bad.

02:24.145 --> 02:25.744
(Whimpering)

02:25.746 --> 02:27.112
(Laughs)

02:27.114 --> 02:29.481
(Whispering)
Manny is taking a nap,

02:29.483 --> 02:31.917
(normal voice) So I put
a pig-a-let in the bed!

02:31.919 --> 02:32.951
(Stifles laugh)
Oh, my god.

02:32.953 --> 02:34.086
Where'd you get that?

02:34.088 --> 02:36.922
You remember those farmers
that we met? (Giggles)

02:36.924 --> 02:40.259
You'll be surprised what they'll
do for a couple of big tips.

02:40.261 --> 02:42.461
(Whispering)
What did you hear?

02:42.463 --> 02:43.829
(Pig snorting)

02:43.831 --> 02:45.797
Aah!
Whoa! What is that?!

02:45.799 --> 02:47.599
It's a pig-a-let!

02:47.601 --> 02:49.768
Man, you should see
your face!

02:49.770 --> 02:52.137
Ohh, it licked my face!
Why would you do this?

02:52.139 --> 02:54.473
Aye, Manny,
don't be so uptight!

02:54.475 --> 02:56.441
I'm preparing you for college

02:56.443 --> 02:59.111
so that you fit in
and make some friends.

02:59.113 --> 03:01.947
I took the idea from watching
<i> "the animal house,"</i>

03:01.949 --> 03:03.649
<i> "the old school"</i> movie...

03:03.651 --> 03:06.618
College is about higher
education, not pranks.

03:06.620 --> 03:08.353
Nerd!

03:08.355 --> 03:11.190
-There she is!
-Hey, lady.

03:11.192 --> 03:12.791
Yeah, I can't give you
free stuff.

03:12.793 --> 03:14.626
-Let's go.
-Okay, take care.

03:14.628 --> 03:16.295
Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait.

03:16.297 --> 03:18.664
Oh, my gosh.
It's her.

03:18.666 --> 03:20.299
Who?

03:20.301 --> 03:21.700
The blonde over there in the
cute jacket and fab shoes.

03:21.702 --> 03:24.703
If that's who I think it is,
we hate her so hard.

03:24.705 --> 03:27.973
Last night, I was robbed.
That's right.

03:27.975 --> 03:30.375
There I was at
Lily's dance recital,

03:30.377 --> 03:31.810
breathlessly anticipating

03:31.812 --> 03:34.179
my baby's first-ever
ballet solo.

03:34.181 --> 03:35.647
Okay, here it comes.

03:35.649 --> 03:38.817
This moment is worth every cent
of the $2,000 in lessons.

03:38.819 --> 03:40.219
What?

03:40.221 --> 03:42.321
Oh, my gosh.
I can't see.

03:42.323 --> 03:44.056
Didn't they say
no filming?

03:44.058 --> 03:45.691
Excuse me. Miss?
(Gasps)

03:45.693 --> 03:47.059
Did you just see that?

03:47.061 --> 03:48.660
That horrid woman robbed me

03:48.662 --> 03:50.062
of my proud daddy moment

03:50.064 --> 03:52.331
and forced me to lie
to my daughter.

03:52.333 --> 03:55.033
"You danced beautifully, Lily!"
But did she?

03:55.035 --> 03:56.535
I have no idea!

03:56.537 --> 03:58.170
Why didn't you smack her down
last night?

03:58.172 --> 03:59.371
With words, obviously.

03:59.373 --> 04:01.006
Wait, can gays
smack women?

04:01.008 --> 04:02.407
No.

04:02.409 --> 04:03.709
No!
You know what,

04:03.711 --> 04:05.010
I would have cussed her out
last night,

04:05.012 --> 04:06.245
except the selfish hag
left the moment

04:06.247 --> 04:07.746
her daughter's dance
was over.

04:07.748 --> 04:10.515
I hope there's no rule in here
about causing a commotion.

04:10.517 --> 04:10.515
I mean, we didn't really
feel the need

04:10.517 --> 04:14.586
to put it up on a sign because,
you know, civilization.

04:14.588 --> 04:16.855
Well, I answer
to a higher law.

04:16.857 --> 04:18.857
Hey! Get back here!
You don't even know it's her.

04:18.858 --> 04:20.259
You're basing this off
of the back of the head

04:20.261 --> 04:20.259
of someone you saw
in the dark.

04:20.261 --> 04:23.695
That may be how you recognize
your old boyfriends, but...

04:23.697 --> 04:25.230
Excuse me.

04:25.232 --> 04:27.065
As much as I admire that
and do intend on using it

04:27.067 --> 04:30.936
on Mitchell without giving you
any credit, there is a line.

04:30.938 --> 04:35.207
So, mom, I didn't know that you
would be, uh, be here.

04:35.209 --> 04:38.210
Oh, well, I wasn't
planning on it --

04:38.212 --> 04:40.379
I haven't seen these people
since the divorce --

04:40.381 --> 04:42.881
yeah.
But then my new hubby
had to work,

04:42.883 --> 04:45.050
and I thought --
"write a new story, dede."

04:45.052 --> 04:46.051
Yeah!

04:46.053 --> 04:47.085
(Both chuckle)

04:47.087 --> 04:48.253
So, are you here alone,
or...?

04:48.255 --> 04:50.722
You look great!
This dress is beautiful!

04:50.724 --> 04:52.291
Oh, thank you.

04:52.293 --> 04:54.593
I found it in the trunk
of a car I bought.

04:54.595 --> 04:55.260
(Cellphone chimes)

04:55.262 --> 04:56.561
Oh.
One second, mom.

04:56.563 --> 04:58.096
Oh, this is cam texting.

04:58.098 --> 05:00.065
The picture of the back
of someone's head

05:00.067 --> 05:02.401
and the words,
"is this her?"

05:02.403 --> 05:05.437
No idea what you are
talking about.

05:05.439 --> 05:07.406
Kissy face.

05:07.408 --> 05:09.474
Oh!

05:09.476 --> 05:11.576
Excuse me.
Can we get a pic?

05:11.578 --> 05:12.744
Honey!
-Oh.

05:12.746 --> 05:15.414
-(Chuckles)
-Dad, that's sweet.

05:15.416 --> 05:16.615
Really?

05:16.617 --> 05:18.083
If we get separated,
there's a record.

05:18.085 --> 05:19.117
Oh, god.

05:19.119 --> 05:20.252
Hey, don't be mad.

05:20.254 --> 05:21.086
Are you kidding?

05:21.088 --> 05:22.254
She vanished, okay?

05:22.256 --> 05:24.156
Those shoes she makes
are soundless.

05:24.158 --> 05:26.925
Oh, there you are!

05:26.927 --> 05:28.460
Oh! Mwah!

05:28.462 --> 05:30.262
-Okay.
-Oh, well,

05:30.264 --> 05:32.130
if it isn't my first family.

05:32.132 --> 05:33.632
What a surprise, huh?

05:33.634 --> 05:36.101
Yeah!
I guess Brian invited me

05:36.103 --> 05:37.936
because of that summer
we took him in.

05:37.938 --> 05:41.139
Remember when I caught you
trying on Brian's underpants?

05:41.141 --> 05:43.775
No, what even --
mom!

05:43.777 --> 05:45.510
Oh, is it just
the four of us?
Yeah!

05:45.512 --> 05:47.946
Yes, and where are you
sitting, mom?

05:47.948 --> 05:49.314
I can walk you back
to your table.

05:49.316 --> 05:51.783
In a minute.
I'd like to visit a little.

05:51.785 --> 05:54.052
I don't even know anyone
at my table.

05:58.624 --> 05:59.624
Well, Gloria's not here.

05:59.626 --> 06:01.626
Oh, thank you, Jay.

06:01.628 --> 06:02.994
Here.
Let me, uh...

06:02.996 --> 06:02.994
-Well, this is fun.
-Mm-hmm.

06:02.996 --> 06:05.530
-The band's back together.
-Yeah.

06:05.532 --> 06:06.965
Would anyone care
for some champagne?

06:06.967 --> 06:08.300
-Oh, yeah.
-I'd love some.

06:08.302 --> 06:10.302
-Oh, you bet. Yeah.
-Thank you.

06:10.304 --> 06:11.536
I'll just take the tray.

06:16.142 --> 06:18.310
Admission has gotten tougher.

06:18.312 --> 06:20.979
Only about 4 out of 10
applicants get accepted.

06:20.981 --> 06:22.180
Ugh.

06:22.182 --> 06:23.982
You've beaten worse odds
than that.

06:23.984 --> 06:26.318
We forgot to get you vaccinated
till you were 6.

06:26.320 --> 06:28.820
The university boasts
many noted graduates --

06:28.822 --> 06:30.989
research scientists,
journalists,

06:30.991 --> 06:32.724
and one pretty well-known
playwright.

06:32.726 --> 06:34.693
Wow.
"Pretty well-known?"

06:34.695 --> 06:36.328
Imagine how many cookies
they could have sold

06:36.330 --> 06:38.397
if they called them
"pretty well-known Amos's."

06:38.399 --> 06:39.398
Oh!

06:39.400 --> 06:40.565
(Laughs)

06:40.567 --> 06:42.167
I tied your
shoelaces together.

06:42.169 --> 06:43.702
Mom, what's going on
with you?

06:43.704 --> 06:45.170
I am preparing you.

06:45.172 --> 06:48.173
If you can't laugh at yourself,
then you'll become a target.

06:48.175 --> 06:49.908
College crazy time, man!

06:49.910 --> 06:51.343
(Gasps)

06:51.345 --> 06:53.345
Excuse me, steffi?

06:53.347 --> 06:54.713
My son Tim here developed
a finance app

06:54.715 --> 06:57.015
that caught the eye of
some folks at jp Morgan,

06:57.017 --> 06:59.351
so he'll need to keep that going
along with school.

06:59.353 --> 07:00.519
No problem.

07:00.521 --> 07:02.421
Many students work
while taking class.

07:02.423 --> 07:04.356
-Excuse me, steffi?
-What are you doing?

07:04.358 --> 07:07.225
My son Lucas here is a
recognized amateur trampolinist.

07:07.227 --> 07:08.693
(Hushed voice) Dad!

07:08.695 --> 07:10.529
I'm assuming you guys
have a training facility

07:10.531 --> 07:15.033
so he can continue his pursuits
in the applied bouncing arts?

07:15.035 --> 07:16.535
I'm not sure
I'm understanding...

07:16.537 --> 07:16.535
You guys have
a trampoline?

07:16.537 --> 07:19.571
I think there's a small one
in the daycare center.

07:19.573 --> 07:21.440
There are no small
trampolines, only --

07:21.442 --> 07:22.607
you know what?
We can move on.

07:22.609 --> 07:24.910
Everybody, this way!

07:24.912 --> 07:27.712
Just go ask her if she
was at the recital,

07:27.714 --> 07:28.947
and then tell her off
if she says yes.

07:28.949 --> 07:30.549
No, I can't,
because if it's her,

07:30.551 --> 07:32.584
she'll sense confrontation
coming and deny it.

07:32.586 --> 07:34.786
People can always tell
when I'm in attack mode.

07:34.788 --> 07:36.621
Mm, flared nostrils?
No.

07:36.623 --> 07:38.390
-Vein in your forehead?
-Blotchy neck?

07:38.392 --> 07:39.958
No! You know what,

07:39.960 --> 07:42.727
and just a head's up, you both
are turning into your mother.

07:42.729 --> 07:45.063
Okay.
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo.

07:45.065 --> 07:46.731
New plan.

07:46.733 --> 07:48.567
What --
what are you doing?

07:48.569 --> 07:51.136
Well, if there's video
of Lily's recital on her iPad,

07:51.138 --> 07:52.404
then I know
it's for sure her,

07:52.406 --> 07:53.805
and plus, I can
e-mail it to myself

07:53.807 --> 07:55.073
and have a proper
viewing party.

07:55.075 --> 07:56.908
Ooh, I've got a thing.
Yeah, I'll probably
be working.

07:56.910 --> 07:58.410
I haven't even
set a date yet.

07:58.412 --> 07:58.410
Okay, there's a passcode.

07:58.412 --> 08:01.847
Well, of course there's
a passcode. Give me that.

08:01.849 --> 08:04.449
All right, well, she ordered
a powdered doughnut, so...

08:04.451 --> 08:04.449
All right.

08:04.451 --> 08:07.252
Chalky fingerprints on the 8,
the 5, the 3, and the 1.

08:07.254 --> 08:09.087
Your passcode is some
combination of those four.

08:09.089 --> 08:10.255
Oh, my god.
You're brilliant.

08:10.257 --> 08:12.257
Last year, I was doing
differential topography

08:12.259 --> 08:13.758
at Cal tech,
and now I sketch leaves

08:13.760 --> 08:16.127
in milk foam for adult
skateboarders.

08:16.129 --> 08:17.629
I need something more.

08:17.631 --> 08:18.763
She's coming back.
-What?!

08:18.765 --> 08:21.433
(Whispering)
She's coming back.

08:21.435 --> 08:24.102
Hey!

08:24.104 --> 08:26.304
I left my iPad on the table,
and somebody took it.

08:26.306 --> 08:28.340
Oh, gosh!
I didn't --

08:28.342 --> 08:30.342
didn't what?
Do your job?

08:30.344 --> 08:32.309
It's not like you're so busy
you don't have time to --

08:32.312 --> 08:34.446
excuse me.
I couldn't help overhearing.

08:34.448 --> 08:36.948
Um, are you talking about
that iPad in that bag there?

08:36.950 --> 08:39.484
-Oh, god.
-'Cause there's an iPad there.

08:39.486 --> 08:39.484
-What a ditz.
-(Chuckles)

08:39.486 --> 08:43.455
Ugh, I guess I'm just nervous
for this stupid blind date

08:43.457 --> 08:44.756
I never should
have agreed to.

08:45.958 --> 08:47.292
Oh, no.

08:47.294 --> 08:48.994
You're not Richard,
are you?

08:48.996 --> 08:52.130
Uh, yes. I-i am Richard.
I'm your blind date.

08:52.132 --> 08:53.298
You're, uh, Ana.

08:53.300 --> 08:55.667
Oh!
Am I the worst person ever?

08:55.669 --> 08:57.469
Well, that's what we're
here to find out.

08:57.471 --> 08:59.804
(Laughs) Kidding!
Please sit!

08:59.806 --> 09:01.740
I hope that <i> is</i> her.
She's gross.

09:01.742 --> 09:02.674
I want him
to yell at her.

09:02.676 --> 09:04.509
-Yeah.
-Excuse me.

09:04.511 --> 09:06.378
Um, I'm here
for a blind date,

09:06.380 --> 09:08.046
and my friend didn't even
give me a picture.

09:08.048 --> 09:09.481
I just know
the woman's name.

09:09.483 --> 09:11.349
Any chance
you served an Ana?

09:11.351 --> 09:14.653
Oh!
Well, this is crazy.

09:14.655 --> 09:16.655
Ana, say hello to, uh...

09:16.657 --> 09:17.822
-Richard.
-Yeah.

09:17.824 --> 09:19.658
(Laughs)

09:19.660 --> 09:20.859
Um, sorry, I don't mean
to be forward,

09:20.861 --> 09:23.995
but Vanessa kind of undersold
how attractive you are.

09:23.997 --> 09:26.698
Wowza. (Laughs)

09:26.700 --> 09:29.334
The things I've done because
people tell me I'm pretty,

09:29.336 --> 09:31.236
you'd almost think
i <i> wasn't</i> pretty.

09:32.505 --> 09:35.507
So, 1986,
we were just coming back

09:35.509 --> 09:37.175
from my sister
bebe's wedding

09:37.177 --> 09:40.345
when I first had my dream
about murdering you.

09:40.347 --> 09:42.414
No!
Mitchell has a funny story

09:42.416 --> 09:46.084
that doesn't open old wounds
about cam at a dance recital.

09:46.086 --> 09:48.186
He got so mad,
didn't he, Mitchell?

09:48.188 --> 09:49.020
Tell them!

09:49.022 --> 09:50.755
<i> So</i> mad.

09:50.757 --> 09:53.058
That wasn't '86.
That was '87.

09:53.060 --> 09:54.726
The reason we were late
was because of that damn

09:54.728 --> 09:56.695
hands across America
that you made me do.

09:56.697 --> 09:58.730
Hands was '86,

09:58.732 --> 10:00.365
and you
thanked me afterwards

10:00.367 --> 10:02.400
because you got to hold hands
with someone

10:02.402 --> 10:04.269
that was holding hands
with Willie Nelson.

10:04.271 --> 10:06.271
What the hell was that whole
thing about, anyway? Hunger?

10:06.273 --> 10:08.273
Hand somebody a sandwich
in San Francisco

10:08.275 --> 10:09.608
and you pass it on
down the line

10:09.610 --> 10:11.876
till some bum gets ahold of it
in Boston?

10:11.878 --> 10:13.545
Hunger, yeah.
Definitely.

10:13.547 --> 10:15.547
Um, Mitchell is on a diet,
speaking of hunger.

10:15.549 --> 10:16.615
What can you eat now?

10:16.617 --> 10:20.051
Uh...Less.

10:20.053 --> 10:23.088
Sweetie,
i see what you're doing,

10:23.090 --> 10:27.058
but this whole controlling
thing -- it's challenging.

10:27.060 --> 10:27.058
Works good in the office,

10:27.060 --> 10:30.962
but sometimes she's as tight
as a camel's ass in a sandstorm.

10:30.964 --> 10:32.597
Ooh, this seems aggressive.

10:32.599 --> 10:34.099
I'm just gonna --

10:34.101 --> 10:36.134
may I be excused to go
to the bathroom?

10:36.136 --> 10:38.803
Yeah. Me, too.
Be right back.

10:40.573 --> 10:42.474
Hey!
You do not get to do this.

10:42.476 --> 10:43.908
You do not get
to shut down on me

10:43.910 --> 10:45.076
like you did
when we were kids.

10:45.078 --> 10:47.278
I am not gonna sit here
taking the heat

10:47.280 --> 10:49.914
while you go hide in your room
blasting pat benatar.

10:49.916 --> 10:51.483
Why are we even all
sitting together?

10:51.485 --> 10:53.284
This is my plan. You're gonna
come up with a reason

10:53.286 --> 10:55.253
to take mom back
to her table.

10:55.255 --> 10:56.821
Maybe you want to unload
some gay stuff

10:56.823 --> 10:57.956
you don't want dad
to hear?

10:57.958 --> 10:59.424
You're lovely.

10:59.426 --> 11:01.993
But my dream analyst
helped me realize

11:01.995 --> 11:04.295
that I never wanted
to murder you.

11:04.297 --> 11:07.799
I wanted to murder the part
of myself that was so angry.

11:07.801 --> 11:10.268
You were angry because I was
an inconsiderate blow-hard.

11:10.270 --> 11:11.603
Oh, don't do that.

11:11.605 --> 11:14.639
We had plenty of good times,
didn't we, sarge?

11:14.641 --> 11:15.640
You bet we did, pea.

11:15.642 --> 11:17.142
Oh!

11:17.144 --> 11:18.276
(Both chuckle)

11:18.278 --> 11:20.311
What fresh hell is this?

11:20.313 --> 11:24.115
We'll end our tour here
at our iconic bell tower.

11:24.117 --> 11:25.617
See you all
at tonight's mixer!

11:25.619 --> 11:28.119
Hey. Before we go back,
you want to do something fun?

11:28.121 --> 11:30.655
Follow me.

11:30.657 --> 11:32.824
Check it out!
-A bell?

11:32.826 --> 11:34.526
Not just a bell.

11:34.528 --> 11:36.961
A series of bells fed into
an ingenious instrument

11:36.963 --> 11:38.963
known as a carillon.

11:38.965 --> 11:41.132
I monkied around with one
back in the day.

11:41.134 --> 11:43.301
A cutie named Gretchen
took me up to her belfry

11:43.303 --> 11:44.469
and showed me some moves,

11:44.471 --> 11:46.137
which I now realize
sounds sexual.

11:46.139 --> 11:48.173
Not really.
You talk like this a lot.

11:48.175 --> 11:50.008
The point is,
Gretchen got a full ride

11:50.010 --> 11:52.143
treading bells like these.
Wow, that's high.

11:52.145 --> 11:54.312
Maybe you could, too.

11:54.314 --> 11:56.181
Get you into a class on...

11:56.183 --> 11:59.517
What? I'm gonna learn all this
in three months?

11:59.519 --> 12:00.652
You're a quick study!

12:00.654 --> 12:01.920
Look at how fast
you learned magic.

12:01.922 --> 12:04.355
I got a home movie of you
pulling an impossibly long chain

12:04.357 --> 12:05.824
of baby wipes
out of your diaper.

12:05.826 --> 12:07.826
Okay, I was 5 in a diaper.

12:07.828 --> 12:09.394
That's not really a sign
of a quick learner.

12:09.396 --> 12:10.829
(Gasps)

12:10.831 --> 12:12.697
I believe you can do anything
you put your mind to.

12:12.699 --> 12:13.832
Why?

12:13.834 --> 12:15.567
(Bells chiming)
Oh! Shoot!

12:15.569 --> 12:17.235
I guess it's all
computerized now.

12:17.237 --> 12:18.570
Who cares?

12:18.572 --> 12:20.505
God, I hate it
when you do this.

12:20.507 --> 12:22.674
Do what? You look mad.
Are you mad?

12:22.676 --> 12:24.509
(Bells chiming)

12:24.511 --> 12:27.345
(Yelling indistinctly)

12:27.347 --> 12:28.246
...and I keep telling you,

12:28.248 --> 12:29.514
but it's like
you're not hearing me!

12:29.516 --> 12:31.683
I'm not.
Wait, don't talk yet.

12:31.685 --> 12:34.018
(Chiming continues)

12:34.020 --> 12:35.386
Go now, quick!

12:35.388 --> 12:36.688
Stop acting like
I'm someone I'm not!

12:36.690 --> 12:38.356
Stop telling me how great I am
when it's not true!

12:38.358 --> 12:39.858
Don't you see how much pressure
that is?!

12:39.860 --> 12:41.392
Luke, don't you
walk away from --

12:41.394 --> 12:42.861
(bell chimes)

12:42.863 --> 12:43.762
...me!

12:43.764 --> 12:45.830
I'm your --
(Chimes)

12:50.035 --> 12:51.202
How are you 36?

12:51.204 --> 12:52.871
I just can't get over
how young you look.

12:52.873 --> 12:54.873
The trick is to not smile
too hard.

12:54.875 --> 12:56.541
(Laughs)
You're funny.

12:56.543 --> 12:57.876
(Chuckles uneasily)

12:57.878 --> 12:59.944
I did not expect that
from a seismologist.

12:59.946 --> 13:01.813
Which, by the way,
how did you get into <i> that?</i>

13:01.815 --> 13:05.717
Oh, um, it's just always
come easy for me.

13:05.719 --> 13:07.752
You know?
I look at people

13:07.754 --> 13:09.220
and I just instinctively know
their size.

13:09.222 --> 13:11.289
People are like,
"oh, I'm a 4,"

13:11.291 --> 13:13.224
and I'm like, "who you foolin',
girl? You a 10." (Laughs)

13:13.226 --> 13:15.393
Ma'am, here is that napkin
you asked for.

13:15.395 --> 13:17.061
Oh, thanks. Ha ha.
Fooled you.

13:17.063 --> 13:19.130
I was just joking about
clothing stuff.

13:19.132 --> 13:23.468
The real reason why I got
into studying earthquakes

13:23.470 --> 13:25.904
is because I love nature.

13:25.906 --> 13:27.438
I guess that would explain the
ornithology interest, too, huh?

13:27.440 --> 13:29.407
(Dish clatters)
(Laughs uneasily)

13:29.409 --> 13:30.742
Miss, could
i have another...

13:30.744 --> 13:32.777
Um, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah.

13:32.779 --> 13:36.414
<i> Angels</i> have always
been cool,

13:36.416 --> 13:40.285
but <i> not</i> as cool as <i> birds!</i>

13:40.287 --> 13:42.253
I love birds!
(Chuckles insincerely)

13:42.255 --> 13:43.488
I mean,
i love my mother, I do,

13:43.490 --> 13:46.658
but it's like her needs
come before everyone else's.

13:46.660 --> 13:47.826
You know
that kind of person?

13:47.828 --> 13:49.594
I think I do, yeah.

13:49.596 --> 13:51.262
Wait, why was
i talking about her?

13:51.264 --> 13:52.630
I don't know.
The question was

13:52.632 --> 13:53.765
"what did you do
last night?"

13:53.767 --> 13:55.099
And the question stands.

13:55.101 --> 13:56.601
(Cellphone chimes)
Oh!

13:56.603 --> 13:58.603
Sorry.

13:58.605 --> 13:59.804
(Groans)

13:59.806 --> 14:01.339
Ex-husband.
(Groans)

14:01.341 --> 14:03.274
Honestly, it's like
he can't be with my son

14:03.276 --> 14:04.809
for more than three hours

14:04.811 --> 14:06.811
without texting me
some inane question.

14:06.813 --> 14:08.479
Oh -- oh, you have a son?

14:08.481 --> 14:10.481
(Sighs)

14:10.483 --> 14:12.483
Love of my life.

14:12.485 --> 14:13.518
(Sighs, chuckles)

14:13.520 --> 14:16.120
He took the divorce
pretty hard.

14:16.122 --> 14:19.123
He's...Different,
you know?

14:19.125 --> 14:22.694
He's really --
he's creative and sensitive,

14:22.696 --> 14:27.632
and he gets picked on
a lot at school.

14:27.634 --> 14:30.668
You know, it's like,
thank god for his dance class.

14:30.670 --> 14:33.171
(Voice breaking) I feel like
it's the only place

14:33.173 --> 14:35.039
that I see, like,
real joy on his face.

14:36.842 --> 14:38.877
I knew it.
You're the worst!

14:38.879 --> 14:40.144
Excuse me?

14:40.146 --> 14:41.813
I'm not Richard, you fool.

14:41.815 --> 14:43.815
I'm the father
you and your giant iPad

14:43.817 --> 14:46.050
robbed of his daughter's
first ballet solo.

14:46.052 --> 14:47.819
I hope whatever reason
you had

14:47.821 --> 14:51.222
to prioritize your child
over mine was a good one,

14:51.224 --> 14:53.024
and now that I hear it,
it's pretty close,

14:53.026 --> 14:55.493
I have to admit,
but <i> still.</i>

14:55.495 --> 14:56.895
Wow!

14:56.897 --> 14:58.396
You're a maniac,

14:58.398 --> 14:59.998
but I'm grateful

15:00.000 --> 15:03.201
because <i> this</i> has been one of
the most abysmal dates

15:03.203 --> 15:04.702
I have ever been on.
Oh!

15:04.704 --> 15:06.871
People think that cats
are standoffish,

15:06.873 --> 15:07.872
but my guy,
when I come home --

15:07.874 --> 15:09.574
okay, I've got to stop you
right there.

15:09.576 --> 15:12.176
I'm not Ana,
and this isn't happening.

15:12.178 --> 15:14.679
I had a feeling.
(Chuckles)

15:14.681 --> 15:16.347
Can I at least take a picture
with you

15:16.349 --> 15:18.016
so I can tell other women
we dated?

15:18.018 --> 15:19.350
What?! No!

15:19.352 --> 15:20.685
You're right.

15:20.687 --> 15:22.353
It's just that
you're so pretty.

15:22.355 --> 15:25.423
All right, get in here.

15:25.425 --> 15:26.891
Ma'am?

15:26.893 --> 15:28.192
Manny, come on.

15:28.194 --> 15:29.894
We're going to be late
for the mixer.

15:29.896 --> 15:31.930
Uh, excuse me, did I say
your time-out was over?

15:31.932 --> 15:32.864
Back on the bed.

15:32.866 --> 15:35.199
I'm sorry, okay?
No more pranks.

15:35.201 --> 15:36.734
I promise.

15:36.736 --> 15:39.704
I just wanted to have fun
with you. Geez!

15:39.706 --> 15:41.239
(Whirring)

15:41.241 --> 15:45.376
I forgot I did that one!
(Stifles laugh)

15:45.378 --> 15:46.911
Aye, Manny!
Por favor!

15:46.913 --> 15:48.046
Get out.
Get out!

15:48.048 --> 15:49.080
Luke, we should talk
about this!

15:49.082 --> 15:49.080
There's nothing
to talk about.

15:49.082 --> 15:51.783
And you're not coming
to this stupid party.

15:51.785 --> 15:53.551
I'm going alone.
-So am I.

15:53.553 --> 15:54.552
(Door slams)

15:54.554 --> 15:55.753
-Eh.
-Wow.

15:55.755 --> 15:57.555
Like I want to take
some stupid bell class

15:57.557 --> 15:59.590
so we can all find out there's
one more thing I can't do.

15:59.592 --> 16:01.559
Oh, boo-hoo.
Your dad believes in you.

16:01.561 --> 16:04.295
My mom's treating me like I'm
on some Japanese game show.

16:04.297 --> 16:06.130
Fine! You win!

16:06.132 --> 16:08.566
You win worst parent,
you win college.

16:08.568 --> 16:10.568
Hope you have fun here
while I'm shoveling poo

16:10.570 --> 16:12.403
in some underground
poo-shoveling place.

16:12.405 --> 16:13.404
Well, why'd you
even come here

16:13.406 --> 16:14.772
if you're so sure
you can't get in?

16:14.774 --> 16:14.772
I don't know.

16:14.774 --> 16:17.909
Maybe because this is the one
place we might both get in.

16:17.911 --> 16:19.911
That might make this whole thing
a little less scary!

16:19.913 --> 16:21.646
Well, that's the only reason
i applied, too!

16:21.648 --> 16:23.081
Then why are we fighting?!
I don't know!

16:23.083 --> 16:25.717
So, are we still going
to the party?
Yeah, I'll put on a hat!

16:27.820 --> 16:30.154
I just wanted Luke to feel good
about himself, you know?

16:30.156 --> 16:31.923
Cheer him on a little.

16:31.925 --> 16:34.993
Maybe there is such a thing
as too much cheerleading.

16:34.995 --> 16:37.328
You tell him he can do anything,
and when he can't,

16:37.330 --> 16:39.130
he feels like
he's disappointing you.

16:39.132 --> 16:41.499
Luke knows I'd never be
disappointed in him.

16:41.501 --> 16:43.267
Does he?
Luke is very sweet,

16:43.269 --> 16:45.436
but he doesn't know
a lot of things.

16:45.438 --> 16:46.771
So I'm supposed
to pump him up,

16:46.773 --> 16:49.140
but not so much that he's afraid
to let me down.

16:49.142 --> 16:50.808
It's ironic that I'm
struggling with this

16:50.810 --> 16:53.244
since my greatest cheerleading
move was threading the needle.

16:54.346 --> 16:56.280
It's when your seven cheermates
make hoop arms --

16:56.282 --> 16:58.316
I don't care.

16:58.318 --> 17:00.184
I just want Manny to learn
how to take a joke.

17:00.186 --> 17:03.121
Yes, but there's a difference
between a joke

17:03.123 --> 17:04.989
and yelling "pervert!"
Before shoving him

17:04.991 --> 17:06.124
into the girls'
locker room.

17:06.126 --> 17:07.458
Aye, please,
that was funny.

17:07.460 --> 17:09.359
Besides, I was the one who broke
a heel

17:09.362 --> 17:11.295
trying to keep
the door shut.

17:11.297 --> 17:12.997
College is a big change.

17:12.999 --> 17:14.999
I'm just trying to keep it
light for him.

17:15.001 --> 17:16.800
For him or for you?

17:16.803 --> 17:19.804
(Sighs) Okay.

17:19.806 --> 17:22.807
He's leaving me for the first
time in his life.

17:22.809 --> 17:24.842
I've been married,
I've been divorced,

17:24.844 --> 17:26.844
I've lived here,
I've lived there.

17:26.846 --> 17:29.814
I drove a taxi,
i won <i> "star search."</i>

17:29.816 --> 17:33.484
Through all the changes
in my life, there was always us.

17:33.486 --> 17:35.520
Like partners.

17:35.522 --> 17:40.324
If I don't keep this light,
i am going to be very sad.

17:40.326 --> 17:42.727
I know. It stinks.

17:42.729 --> 17:45.496
You just have to hope
they get irritating enough

17:45.498 --> 17:47.498
by the end of the year that
you're ready for them to go.

17:47.500 --> 17:50.835
Maybe I should give him
his harmonica back.

17:50.837 --> 17:52.904
That's the spirit.

17:52.906 --> 17:55.573
Here, take my half steak.

17:55.575 --> 17:57.175
I'll take half your fish.

17:57.177 --> 17:59.210
I got to trick my arteries
every once in a while,

17:59.212 --> 18:01.212
keep them on their toes.
(Chuckles)

18:01.214 --> 18:03.347
Well, I don't know what you're
doing, but you look great.

18:03.349 --> 18:04.582
And you look great, too.

18:04.584 --> 18:06.017
Oh, look, there's no line
at the bar.

18:06.019 --> 18:08.219
How about a rob Roy
for old time's sake?

18:08.221 --> 18:11.022
Oh, you remembered, sarge.

18:11.024 --> 18:14.525
That was the only drink I could
keep down when I was pregnant.

18:14.527 --> 18:16.761
Who are those people?

18:16.763 --> 18:19.397
You heard them.
They're "sarge" and "pea."

18:19.399 --> 18:22.066
Two nicknames I have never heard
in my entire life.

18:22.068 --> 18:23.901
This kindness,
i don't trust it.

18:23.903 --> 18:26.871
I know, it's like a purple sky
before a storm.
Exactly.

18:26.873 --> 18:30.241
Beautiful until you realize
the birds are agitated

18:30.243 --> 18:32.043
and ants are
walking in circles.

18:32.045 --> 18:32.043
Actually, you know what?

18:32.045 --> 18:34.545
My -- my stomach's feeling
a little weird.

18:34.547 --> 18:37.381
I think I'm gonna take a walk,
get a little fresh air.

18:37.383 --> 18:39.450
Oh, no, you don't. You are not
running away this time. No.

18:39.452 --> 18:40.551
Let go, bossy!

18:40.553 --> 18:42.887
Sit down. We are gonna suffer
like a family!

18:42.889 --> 18:44.722
No. Don't -- don't stretch out
my jacket!

18:44.724 --> 18:46.424
I just got back
into slim fit!

18:46.426 --> 18:47.792
(Glass shatters)

18:47.794 --> 18:49.060
(Gasps)

18:49.062 --> 18:50.728
-Is everything all right?
-Yeah.

18:50.730 --> 18:50.728
-He's fine.
-I just --

18:50.730 --> 18:53.131
oh, no, of course.
Yeah, go get that.

18:53.133 --> 18:54.398
What's going on?

18:54.400 --> 18:55.900
-Oh...
-She pushed <i> me.</i>

18:55.902 --> 18:57.068
I didn't push him.

18:57.070 --> 18:58.569
He just, you know,
slipped, fell.

18:58.571 --> 19:01.105
Sit down, sit down.
You're causing a scene.

19:01.107 --> 19:02.640
It's very embarrassing.

19:02.642 --> 19:04.909
You have been quite rude today,
young lady.

19:04.911 --> 19:06.277
General patton over there.

19:06.279 --> 19:09.413
And this one is basically
a cardboard cutout

19:09.415 --> 19:11.616
who occasionally sips wine
and sighs.

19:11.618 --> 19:14.285
We did not raise you
to act like this.

19:14.287 --> 19:16.821
-Oh, excuse me.
-No, i-i got it.

19:16.823 --> 19:20.491
No, in fact, you raised us
to act exactly like this, okay?

19:20.493 --> 19:22.426
You two are the ones
that are acting crazy.

19:22.428 --> 19:23.961
What are you
talking about?

19:23.963 --> 19:26.297
Who the hell
are sarge and pea,

19:26.299 --> 19:28.132
and where were they
when we were growing up?

19:28.134 --> 19:30.001
Yeah, maybe if those two people
had raised us,

19:30.003 --> 19:31.669
there would have been room
in our house

19:31.671 --> 19:33.104
for other people
to have emotions

19:33.106 --> 19:36.340
and somebody wouldn't have had
to shut himself down.

19:37.342 --> 19:39.443
And maybe <i> somebody</i>
wouldn't be trying

19:39.445 --> 19:40.611
to control the whole world

19:40.613 --> 19:41.846
because she couldn't control
the chaos

19:41.848 --> 19:43.147
in her own
home growing up.

19:43.149 --> 19:44.182
Oh, come on.

19:44.184 --> 19:46.117
We all know that's
what's wrong with her.

19:46.119 --> 19:47.818
-Oh, god.
-So, come on.

19:47.820 --> 19:49.287
What do you have to say
for yourselves?

19:49.289 --> 19:51.622
-Well, you're not wrong.
-True.

19:51.624 --> 19:53.291
I'm -- I'm sorry.
One more time.
What?

19:53.293 --> 19:56.994
We didn't behave well
when we were married,

19:56.996 --> 20:00.331
and I feel bad
about that.
Me, too.

20:00.333 --> 20:02.633
We thought we were staying
together for you,

20:02.635 --> 20:04.969
but I don't know,
maybe we'd forced you

20:04.971 --> 20:07.505
to live with two unhappy people
for too long.

20:07.507 --> 20:09.640
But we're happy now.

20:09.642 --> 20:14.145
And that's probably why we're
able to be our old selves today.

20:14.147 --> 20:15.713
We should have said this
a long time ago,

20:15.715 --> 20:18.683
but we didn't give you the kind
of home you deserved,

20:18.685 --> 20:21.185
and for that, we're sorry.

20:21.187 --> 20:22.553
Well, you --
i mean, there was --

20:22.555 --> 20:23.721
there was
happy times, too.

20:23.723 --> 20:25.556
Yeah, no, it wasn't
all crazytown.

20:25.558 --> 20:26.657
It was --
yeah.

20:26.659 --> 20:28.159
("At last" plays)
(Gasps)

20:28.161 --> 20:29.193
Listen.

20:29.195 --> 20:30.494
We're good, right?
We can go?

20:30.496 --> 20:32.430
Yes. Of course.
Go.

20:34.032 --> 20:37.168
Wow.
How about that?

20:37.170 --> 20:39.070
An apology.

20:39.072 --> 20:43.241
I don't think I ever thought
it would feel so good.

20:43.243 --> 20:45.676
(Sighs)

20:45.678 --> 20:47.345
I do like
seeing them happy.

20:47.347 --> 20:49.347
Yeah.

20:49.349 --> 20:50.915
Ohh, you.

20:50.917 --> 20:52.183
Shut up.

20:52.185 --> 20:54.352
I feel stuff.

20:54.354 --> 20:56.420
I know.

21:00.692 --> 21:05.196
¶¶

21:05.198 --> 21:08.399
son of a bitch!
That is coconuts!

21:08.401 --> 21:09.934
I remember you!

21:16.375 --> 21:17.942
Do you miss spokesmodeling?

21:17.944 --> 21:19.777
Aye, I do a boat show
every now and then.

21:19.779 --> 21:21.545
That's how I keep
my hand in it.

21:21.547 --> 21:22.913
(Giggles)
Watch, watch.

21:22.915 --> 21:24.348
This is how
i sealed the deal.

21:28.754 --> 21:30.955
(Gasps)
That's you again!
