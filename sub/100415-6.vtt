TEDESCO:
He said he knew you.

00:09.552 --> 00:12.680
Fucking Bosch. He's behind this.

00:12.722 --> 00:15.015
Guy wasn't a cop. The man reeked

00:15.099 --> 00:17.727
of prison, baby.
I know the difference.

00:17.768 --> 00:19.228
What'd he look like?

00:19.270 --> 00:23.190
Biker. Big. Long hair, beard.

00:23.232 --> 00:25.526
How could he know
what we're doing?

00:25.568 --> 00:27.695
You fucked up talking to him.

00:27.737 --> 00:32.158
Yeah, I-I just
got flustered. Hey,

00:32.199 --> 00:35.995
I'm sorry.

00:36.036 --> 00:39.331
Why don't you get some of your
friends to sit closer, hmm?

00:39.373 --> 00:42.168
Block the view.

00:42.209 --> 00:43.669
I want to get freaky.

00:45.713 --> 00:47.465
Jesus, you're twisted, Rita.

00:47.506 --> 00:52.011
Yeah, just the way you like it.

00:52.052 --> 00:54.972
Hmm? Come on.

00:58.559 --> 01:01.020
(sighs) Let me make it
up to you, baby.

01:01.061 --> 01:04.732
Hey. Bosch says
he's got you on tape.

01:04.774 --> 01:06.150
What could he have?

01:06.192 --> 01:09.820
Boring phone calls
between me and your lawyer.

01:09.862 --> 01:13.157
I've been really
careful there, I swear.

01:13.199 --> 01:16.911
We need to know
who that biker asshole is.

01:16.952 --> 01:19.163
Yeah, tell me what to do.

01:19.205 --> 01:23.334
Cronyn. Talk to Cronyn.

01:23.375 --> 01:25.961
He wants his third,
he's got to fucking fix this.

01:26.003 --> 01:27.463
Okay.

01:27.505 --> 01:30.216
In person. No more phones.

01:58.661 --> 02:01.497
Yeah, she was there
for an hour or so, all told.

02:01.539 --> 02:03.874
-Just getting to work now.
-Terry Spencer.

02:03.916 --> 02:05.251
BONNER:
Civilian,

02:05.292 --> 02:07.127
working for LAPD,
no criminal record.

02:07.169 --> 02:08.921
Couldn't work Property
if he did.

02:08.963 --> 02:11.048
BONNER:
Followed him home last night.

02:11.090 --> 02:14.635
Studio City, the flats.
Standard suburban crib.

02:14.677 --> 02:17.471
Bought it in, uh, 2001.

02:17.513 --> 02:21.100
Mortgage, 800K.

02:21.141 --> 02:22.852
Little high
for that neighborhood.

02:22.893 --> 02:25.896
BONNER: So they refied twice
before the crash.

02:25.896 --> 02:29.149
Second marriage. Still paying
alimony on the first.

02:29.191 --> 02:31.694
Dude's so deep in debt,
he's fucking breathing dirt.

02:31.735 --> 02:34.363
-Current wife?
-BONNER: Teacher.

02:34.405 --> 02:36.073
Yeah, she's not footing
any bills.

02:36.156 --> 02:38.701
So how did Cronyn find Spencer?

02:38.742 --> 02:42.913
That face is plastered all over
bus benches and billboards.

02:42.955 --> 02:44.874
Maybe Spencer found him.

02:44.915 --> 02:46.250
CHANDLER:
I know you're

02:46.292 --> 02:48.377

02:48.419 --> 02:49.628
Not mine.

02:49.670 --> 02:53.507

RECEPTIONIST (over phone):
Cronyn & Cronyn.

03:00.347 --> 03:02.725
Yes, I'd like to speak
to Lance Cronyn, please.

03:02.766 --> 03:04.143
RECEPTIONIST:
May I ask who's calling?

03:04.184 --> 03:06.562
Terry Spencer.
Tell him it's urgent.

03:06.604 --> 03:08.731
RECEPTIONIST:
One moment.

03:08.772 --> 03:11.275
Here goes nothing.

03:11.317 --> 03:14.403
CRONYN: Mr. Spencer? I wasn't
expecting to hear from you.

03:14.445 --> 03:18.949
I'm not your
point person. Hello?

03:18.991 --> 03:22.578
Mr. Spencer? Hello?

03:25.372 --> 03:28.292
So who's Spencer's contact?
Rita?

03:28.334 --> 03:29.460
Not sure.

03:29.501 --> 03:30.711
Stay on her, Bonner.

03:30.753 --> 03:32.379
Yeah, I'm on it.

03:35.049 --> 03:36.425
Where'd you find him?

03:36.467 --> 03:38.677
Hector was a pro bono
appeal years ago

03:38.719 --> 03:41.138
when I was
a single-shingle lawyer.

03:41.180 --> 03:43.057
Wrongly convicted
of manslaughter.

03:43.098 --> 03:45.184
Witness recanted,
I won the appeal,

03:45.225 --> 03:48.020
Hector was released,
he's been with me ever since.

03:48.062 --> 03:50.689
He's... devoted to me.

03:52.733 --> 03:55.194
What do your fancy white shoe
partners make of him?

03:55.235 --> 03:56.904
(chuckles)
They wish he wouldn't sit

03:56.946 --> 03:58.322
in the waiting room so often.

03:58.364 --> 04:01.283
Too bad. He goes where I go.

04:01.325 --> 04:05.329
And he's good at what he does,
like you.

04:05.371 --> 04:08.624
You're comparing me and Bonner.

04:08.666 --> 04:12.211
In fact, when you're done
chasing bad guys, Bosch,

04:12.252 --> 04:14.129
I could use a guy like you.

04:14.171 --> 04:15.464
You're offering me a job?

04:15.506 --> 04:17.508
I think you and Hector
would make a great team.

04:17.549 --> 04:22.179
Helping the scumbags skate?
It's not my style, but thanks.

04:22.221 --> 04:26.100
I'd rather drink muddy water,
as the old song goes.

04:26.141 --> 04:28.310
Everyone deserves
their day in court.

04:28.352 --> 04:29.937

O'Jays. Want to get on board

I know you're a huge fan.

05:53.395 --> 05:55.939
Love you like a brother, Bob,
you know that.

05:57.983 --> 05:59.443
What's so fascinating?

05:59.485 --> 06:01.945
Interviews with
the Skyler family.

06:01.987 --> 06:04.573
First one,
right after the murder,

06:04.615 --> 06:07.534
"Sister tells the cops
Danielle's pendant's missing."

06:07.576 --> 06:09.912
Follow-up questions
are all about the pendant.

06:09.953 --> 06:11.747
How often did she wear it?

06:11.789 --> 06:13.499
Any recent pictures
of her wearing it?

06:13.540 --> 06:15.250
Was she wearing it that night?

06:15.292 --> 06:17.461
What's so important
about the pendant, remind me?

06:17.503 --> 06:19.171
The only physical evidence

06:19.213 --> 06:21.298
that directly links Borders
to the victim.

06:21.340 --> 06:26.095
Okay. So?

06:26.136 --> 06:28.680
So I know Bosch planted it
in Borders' apartment.

06:28.722 --> 06:31.475
Olmer's DNA at the crime scene
proves that.

06:31.517 --> 06:34.853
Proves somebody did.

06:34.895 --> 06:37.689
I mean, dozens of coppers in
and out of Borders' apartment.

06:37.731 --> 06:39.942
You sound just like my partner.

06:43.362 --> 06:46.198
Who did the interviews? Bosch?

06:46.240 --> 06:49.409
Detective R. Rodgers.

06:49.451 --> 06:51.912
My honest opinion?

06:51.954 --> 06:55.332
-Always.
-Irregardless of what went down

06:55.374 --> 06:57.709
between you and Bosch,
he should've had your back.

06:57.751 --> 06:58.710
No question.

06:58.752 --> 07:00.879
Thank you.

07:00.921 --> 07:03.132
Yeah, that was wrong.

07:03.173 --> 07:05.634
And if it made the difference
to your career down the line...

07:05.676 --> 07:08.428
-It did.
-Well, that's a shame.

07:08.470 --> 07:11.890
And that's on him, too.

07:11.932 --> 07:16.854
But the DNA proves the
department was wrong on Borders.

07:16.895 --> 07:18.897
What more payback do you want?

07:18.939 --> 07:22.609
A lot more.

07:22.651 --> 07:24.653
(phone buzzes)

07:30.868 --> 07:34.121
Okay, Jerry, we're on.

Tomorrow afternoon, 1:00.

07:36.999 --> 07:40.043
-We're gonna need a team.
-We'll talk to Billets.

07:49.178 --> 07:50.387
Hey.

07:51.597 --> 07:54.016
Hey.

07:55.976 --> 07:58.312
Uh, tell me
what this looks like.

08:04.860 --> 08:06.403
It looks wrong.

08:06.445 --> 08:09.406
Right? Poked around
in the Category Twos

08:09.448 --> 08:13.493
and found this one as well.

08:13.535 --> 08:16.496
Hmm.

08:16.538 --> 08:19.458
You're still a detective.

08:19.499 --> 08:21.835
Yes, I am.

08:21.877 --> 08:24.004
Tip of the iceberg?

08:24.046 --> 08:26.256
I'm thinking it is.

08:26.298 --> 08:29.635
Filed as "brandishing,"

08:29.676 --> 08:33.555
but the vic said the man
pointed the gun directly at her.

08:33.597 --> 08:37.601
Most would call that
"assault with a deadly weapon."

08:37.643 --> 08:40.437
I would. Now this one,

08:40.479 --> 08:43.315
same thing, last month.

08:43.357 --> 08:44.733
Somebody's juking the stats.

08:44.775 --> 08:48.946
(sighs) I'll look into it.

08:48.987 --> 08:52.324
A lesser detective
might've missed the pattern.

08:52.366 --> 08:53.825
Good thing we were on the ball.

08:53.867 --> 08:55.244
Yeah, don't push it.

(indistinct radio transmission)

09:09.758 --> 09:12.427
Need us to hang around?

Los Angeles Police Department

09:14.221 --> 09:16.515
appreciates your diligence
and your dedication.

09:16.556 --> 09:19.601
(chuckles) Did nothing but shoo
away homeless folks all night.

09:19.643 --> 09:21.228
Then go home and get some sleep.

09:21.270 --> 09:23.105
-Yo.
-Thanks, boss.

09:23.146 --> 09:25.983
All right, guys, let's check
this area around the car first,

09:26.024 --> 09:27.859
then get it towed to FSD.

09:37.202 --> 09:38.412
Spotless.

09:38.453 --> 09:41.248
No such thing.

09:46.586 --> 09:48.839
-Hey.
-Any news?

09:48.880 --> 09:52.175
Reverend Crosley and
Darius Natrell alibis check out.

09:52.217 --> 09:54.303

about Bo Jonas.

09:54.344 --> 09:58.348
-Door knocks?
-Mm.

09:58.390 --> 10:01.977
No one's talking to us.

10:02.019 --> 10:04.479
-Some things never change.
-Hm.

10:04.521 --> 10:06.106
Something curious came up
when we searched

10:06.148 --> 10:08.358
-Gary Wise's apartment.
-Oh?

10:08.400 --> 10:10.277
We found a Smith & Wesson
nine mil.

10:10.319 --> 10:12.863
So? Not so uncommon. It's...

10:12.904 --> 10:16.366
Confiscated in a drug bust.
West Bureau, 2013.

10:16.408 --> 10:18.410
It was on the list
to be melted down.

10:18.452 --> 10:21.538
Fuck. How'd it get back
on the streets?

10:21.580 --> 10:23.206
Mm, good question.

10:23.248 --> 10:24.791
-Stuff goes missing.
-Yes it does.

10:24.833 --> 10:28.045
They raided Rolling Sixties
last year,

10:28.086 --> 10:30.547
came up with a dozen pistolas
that were on that list.

10:30.589 --> 10:33.383
-That's got to be an inside job.
-No shit.

10:38.430 --> 10:43.185
-I'm gonna take a walk.
-All right.

10:54.905 --> 10:57.783

10:57.824 --> 11:00.660
That was a long time ago,
and you don't look old enough

11:00.702 --> 11:03.622
-to remember that.
-I remember that bread.

11:03.663 --> 11:05.123
Delicious.

11:05.165 --> 11:08.794
Yes, it was.

11:08.835 --> 11:12.547
Wish I still had the recipe.

11:12.589 --> 11:13.757

11:13.799 --> 11:15.592

11:15.634 --> 11:18.970
-You're here about the shooting?
-Yes, ma'am.

11:19.012 --> 11:21.181

11:21.223 --> 11:25.060

the young man.

11:29.356 --> 11:31.900

11:36.822 --> 11:38.782
I heard the gunshot.

11:38.824 --> 11:42.411
Saw a man run by,
scared to death,

11:42.452 --> 11:44.955
like he was running

13:39.277 --> 13:41.279
"Hold Fast."

13:45.909 --> 13:47.911
(quiet, indistinct chatter)

14:15.730 --> 14:17.315
(chokes)
Robertson.

14:17.357 --> 14:19.734
Robertson...
(whimpers)

14:19.776 --> 14:21.820
I can't... I can't...

14:21.861 --> 14:23.863
ROBERTSON:
Shut it down.

14:23.905 --> 14:25.532
Everyone out of here!
Get her outside!

14:25.574 --> 14:27.367
(coughing)

14:32.247 --> 14:35.792
13-W-10, I'm code 6,
officer needs help.

14:35.834 --> 14:38.670
Unidentified airborne
toxic exposure.

14:38.712 --> 14:41.214
I need a hazmat team and an R-A.

14:41.256 --> 14:44.259
McCURDY: Officer Edgewood's
hunch was correct.

14:44.301 --> 14:48.638
Officer Robson had at least one,
possibly two prior interactions

14:48.680 --> 14:51.141
with Miguel Vasquez.

14:53.393 --> 14:56.021
(whooping)

14:56.062 --> 14:57.856
Police!

14:57.897 --> 15:00.442
Drop what's in your hand,
kick it away and turn around.

15:00.483 --> 15:01.901
-Come on, ese...
-Show me your hands.

15:01.943 --> 15:03.111
We have complaints
of some knucklehead

15:03.153 --> 15:04.946
shooting a pistol in the air.

15:04.988 --> 15:07.115
ROBSON: That's you, right?
The knucklehead in question?

15:07.157 --> 15:09.451
-No guns. Fireworks.
-Fireworks are illegal in L.A.

15:09.492 --> 15:12.579
-You know what? I know you.
-I don't think so.

15:12.621 --> 15:13.872
VASQUEZ: Yeah, you hassled me
on Cinco de Mayo.

15:13.913 --> 15:15.332
ROBSON:
Let me see some ID, ese.

15:15.373 --> 15:17.042
-Chinga tú madre!
-ROBSON: What?

15:17.083 --> 15:19.586
-Hey, back up! Back up!
-Get back now!

15:22.839 --> 15:25.800
Why the gap?

15:25.842 --> 15:29.971
Could be intentional,
could be equipment malfunction.

15:30.013 --> 15:32.807
Can we confirm
the Cinco de Mayo encounter?

15:32.849 --> 15:34.434
Predates body cams.

15:34.476 --> 15:37.646
We're trying to track down
his partner.

15:37.687 --> 15:39.981
When you locate him,
let me know.

15:40.023 --> 15:41.900
Before you talk to him.

15:41.941 --> 15:45.487
Yes, sir. Understood.

15:45.528 --> 15:49.074
Thank you, Captain.

15:49.115 --> 15:50.742
(sighs)

16:14.641 --> 16:17.852
(phone buzzing)

16:17.894 --> 16:20.605
Her plates are registered
to a holding corp.

16:20.647 --> 16:24.984
4248 LLC slash K.

16:25.026 --> 16:27.153
Zelden's the name on the lease.

16:27.195 --> 16:28.905
K as in Kathy.

16:28.947 --> 16:31.533
Yeah. Five minutes out.

16:31.574 --> 16:33.576
See you then.

16:34.994 --> 16:37.414
Hold the elevator, please.

16:40.375 --> 16:42.377
(elevator dings)

16:58.977 --> 17:00.770
Can I help you, sir?

17:00.812 --> 17:03.648
Yeah, I sure hope so.

17:03.690 --> 17:05.734
-How you doing?
-Good, good.

17:05.775 --> 17:07.736
She is this close to a meltdown.

17:07.777 --> 17:09.946
She thinks Borders will blame
her if it all goes bad.

17:09.988 --> 17:12.365
The woman's a wackjob.

17:12.407 --> 17:15.577
She needs to get a grip.
It won't go bad.

17:17.454 --> 17:19.664
-If they have Rita on tape...
-They don't.

17:19.706 --> 17:22.459
It's a bluff.

17:24.919 --> 17:27.505
She's already anxious
about him getting out.

17:27.547 --> 17:30.258
How it's gonna
change everything.

17:30.300 --> 17:32.886
Then tell her
to take a deep breath

17:32.927 --> 17:34.304
and think about the money.

17:34.345 --> 17:36.222
I'll talk to Borders.

17:36.264 --> 17:38.057
And let's put Spencer on ice.

17:38.099 --> 17:40.769
Until after the hearing.

17:40.810 --> 17:42.353
Sorry.

17:42.395 --> 17:44.355
Security guard wouldn't shut up.

17:44.397 --> 17:46.149
No worries.

17:46.191 --> 17:48.151
Give me the bullet points,
I'm on the clock.

17:48.193 --> 17:50.236
Zelden is Cronyn's wife.

17:50.278 --> 17:51.654
Mistress before that.

17:51.696 --> 17:53.072
She's also a real estate lawyer.

17:53.114 --> 17:54.240
Found him that building.

17:54.282 --> 17:56.659
And here she comes.

18:02.248 --> 18:04.793
You got somewhere to be, go.
I won't lose her.

18:04.834 --> 18:07.670
Music to my ears, brother.
Thanks.

CIU, this morning;

20:31.689 --> 20:35.026
Sergeant Delmore Washington,
PAB, yesterday.

20:35.068 --> 20:37.278
So, new developments?

20:39.197 --> 20:41.157
Just putting it to rest.

20:41.199 --> 20:43.660
Thanks.

21:12.981 --> 21:15.358
-I didn't call Mr. Cronyn.
-You sure?

21:15.400 --> 21:18.111
Well, maybe it was a butt dial,
but w-why would I call him?

21:18.152 --> 21:19.779
I know the drill.

21:19.821 --> 21:22.115
-Somebody used your name.
-Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

21:22.156 --> 21:23.574
-Who?
-We don't know.

21:23.616 --> 21:25.660
W-Why would somebody
use my name?

21:25.702 --> 21:27.078
Maybe you should lay low
until after the hearing.

21:27.120 --> 21:29.163
You got some sick leave
coming up?

21:29.205 --> 21:30.873
A little, I guess.

21:30.915 --> 21:33.418
We have a place, you should
stay there for a few days.

21:33.459 --> 21:36.379
-Just till after the hearing.
-I...

21:36.421 --> 21:37.839
Here's the address.

21:43.761 --> 21:45.138
22 years.

21:45.179 --> 21:48.975
City files are
hardly sacrosanct.

21:49.017 --> 21:51.436
Wash was in the files yesterday.

21:51.477 --> 21:54.272
The district attorney advised me

21:54.313 --> 21:56.107
to refresh my memory
of the case.

21:56.149 --> 21:57.775
CIU this morning.

21:57.817 --> 22:00.528
Oh? Who?

22:00.570 --> 22:02.196
Christina Henry.

22:02.238 --> 22:03.906
Any idea why?

22:03.948 --> 22:06.075
Looking to see if I fucked up.

22:06.117 --> 22:08.077
How I might have fucked up.

22:10.204 --> 22:12.790
So what's the missing photo?
Can you tell?

22:12.832 --> 22:15.960
A Polaroid
from the Before Search file.

22:16.002 --> 22:18.421
Borders' bedroom.

22:18.463 --> 22:20.631
The dresser.

22:22.759 --> 22:24.969
What's on your mind, Detective?

22:28.723 --> 22:32.310
When Hollywood patrol
grabbed up Borders

22:32.351 --> 22:34.312
before there was enough
to charge him...

22:34.353 --> 22:35.855
I was there.

22:35.897 --> 22:39.400
Servidone said
you sorted it out,

22:39.442 --> 22:41.069
kicked Borders loose.

22:41.110 --> 22:43.237
As you said, it was premature.

22:44.405 --> 22:46.407
He had a bag.

22:46.449 --> 22:49.410
A backpack. Was it searched?

22:49.452 --> 22:53.247
I couldn't say.
Did you ask Officer Servidone?

22:53.289 --> 22:54.916
Because if it was,
anything found in it

22:54.957 --> 22:56.459
would have been inadmissible.

22:56.501 --> 23:01.672
Borders murdered
Danielle Skyler.

23:01.714 --> 23:04.175
And he's behind bars

23:04.217 --> 23:07.428
because you found that pendant
in his bedroom.

23:08.471 --> 23:11.474
Right.

23:14.477 --> 23:16.854
So he's wearing only a shirt--
no pants--

23:16.896 --> 23:20.191
I ask him,
"A little breezy, no?"

23:20.233 --> 23:23.277
Listen, I... What's this?

23:23.319 --> 23:26.114
Compliments of the gentleman
at the end of the bar.

23:26.155 --> 23:27.323
Jimmy.

23:27.365 --> 23:29.158
Gentleman and a scholar.

23:29.200 --> 23:30.409
Hear, hear.

23:31.953 --> 23:34.163
How soon do you need
to get back?

23:34.205 --> 23:37.542
I don't.
When do you get off shift?

23:37.583 --> 23:39.919
Why?

23:39.961 --> 23:42.797
Eh, I thought maybe
you'd want to go salsa dancing.

23:42.839 --> 23:45.258
Where?

23:45.299 --> 23:48.094
El Floridita.

23:48.136 --> 23:50.721
Show you some steps.

23:50.763 --> 23:53.391
I bet you could.

23:53.432 --> 23:55.393
I know how to salsa dance.

23:55.434 --> 23:58.521
Yeah, I thought you might.

23:58.563 --> 24:00.481
I thought you were married.

24:00.523 --> 24:02.608
(laughs)

24:02.650 --> 24:05.153
Me? Nah.

24:05.194 --> 24:06.571
That's what I tell strange women

24:06.612 --> 24:08.406
-so I don't get hit on.
-(laughs)

24:08.447 --> 24:09.949
CRATE:
So he said,

24:09.991 --> 24:13.411
"Fresh air's good
for the motility."

24:13.452 --> 24:15.246
(laughs):
Motility.

24:15.288 --> 24:16.831
I had to look that up.

24:16.873 --> 24:20.459
It comes from the Latin motus--
motion-- as in,

24:20.501 --> 24:23.296
"It ain't the meat,
it's the motion."

24:23.337 --> 24:24.672
I'm pulling the pin.

24:24.714 --> 24:28.092
-Excuse me?
-L.T.'s right.

24:28.134 --> 24:29.802
It's time.

24:29.844 --> 24:32.722
I'm gonna take my 90
and go live on a beach.

24:32.763 --> 24:34.599
Or a golf course.

24:34.640 --> 24:36.392
(scoffs)
You don't play.

24:37.602 --> 24:40.563
I can learn.

24:40.605 --> 24:45.568
Uh, alimony follows you into
retirement, you know that?

24:45.610 --> 24:48.946
(scoffs)
To the gates of hell, probably.

24:50.239 --> 24:51.824
(exhales)

24:51.866 --> 24:54.285
Can I have your desk chair?

24:57.496 --> 25:00.082
(laughs)

25:12.011 --> 25:14.013
(sniffles)

25:26.108 --> 25:28.110
(floor squeaks)

25:46.337 --> 25:48.339
Thank you.

25:50.299 --> 25:52.593
-You definitely smell
undercover.
-(laughs)

25:52.635 --> 25:55.596
That's the idea. Sorry.

26:03.562 --> 26:04.897
You ever done this before?

26:06.941 --> 26:08.526
It's no big deal, Mads.

26:08.567 --> 26:11.195
Just gonna grab up
my bad guy and get out.

26:13.656 --> 26:15.908
Just don't do anything stupid.

26:17.743 --> 26:22.540
-You're all I have left.
-I'm acutely aware of that.

26:30.298 --> 26:32.258
Mom's birthday's coming up.

26:32.300 --> 26:34.468
I know.

26:34.510 --> 26:36.512
We should do something.

26:38.556 --> 26:41.726
Absolutely. Any ideas?

26:41.767 --> 26:45.187
Thought we could go to Catalina.

26:45.229 --> 26:48.774
Great. Yeah.

26:48.816 --> 26:50.901
Well, let's
figure it out tonight.

26:52.653 --> 26:56.532
She never did believe me
about those flying fish.

26:56.574 --> 26:59.076
(laughs softly)

27:06.208 --> 27:08.336
Somebody wanted lower
violent crime rates,

27:08.377 --> 27:11.130
so they went out and got them.

27:11.172 --> 27:13.007
It's a fairy tale.

27:13.049 --> 27:15.384
Watch your six, L.T.

27:15.426 --> 27:19.889
Nobody loves a stoolie--
excuse me-- whistleblower.

27:19.930 --> 27:22.516
I have no desire to be either.

27:22.558 --> 27:26.479
Don't want it to look like I had
a hand in cooking the books.

27:29.357 --> 27:32.777
Well, this falls
on Captain Cooper, right?

27:32.818 --> 27:35.821
Well, I was acting captain
for part of it.

27:35.863 --> 27:38.657
(sighs)

27:38.699 --> 27:42.703
I want copies of everything.

27:42.745 --> 27:44.872
You really think
it's gonna come to that?

27:44.914 --> 27:47.792
-What?
-(quietly): Blowing the whistle.

27:49.043 --> 27:52.505
Sweet Jesus, I hope not.

27:52.546 --> 27:54.298
Cronyn got somebody
in Property to plant

27:54.340 --> 27:56.175
the handkerchief
with Olmer's DNA?

27:56.217 --> 27:58.219
Civilian named Terry Spencer.

27:58.260 --> 28:00.012
-Can you prove it?
-I'm working on it.

28:01.389 --> 28:03.182
Don't worry.
I'll limp from here.

28:03.224 --> 28:06.060
(phone ringing)

28:07.686 --> 28:10.189
Hey, Jimmy.
I'm here with J. Edgar.

28:10.231 --> 28:11.857
We found the Nissan Sentra
in a warehouse

28:11.899 --> 28:13.442
used by our two shooters.

28:13.484 --> 28:15.444
But we had to shut down
the search yesterday

28:15.486 --> 28:17.613
-for a few hours.
-What was the problem?

28:17.655 --> 28:19.031
Fentanyl residue.

28:19.073 --> 28:20.991
One of my detectives
inhaled some.

28:21.033 --> 28:23.035
-Knocked her ass over teakettle.
-Jesus.

28:23.077 --> 28:24.662
They were dealing fentanyl?

28:24.703 --> 28:25.913
Eh, they were doing
something with it.

28:25.955 --> 28:27.915
It's cheap, fast, lethal

28:27.957 --> 28:30.376
and a hundred times stronger
than heroin.

28:30.418 --> 28:31.961
Your detective's gonna be okay?

28:32.002 --> 28:33.379
She will be.

28:33.421 --> 28:35.464
Took two rounds
of Narcan to bring her back.

28:35.506 --> 28:38.426
-Shit.
-They pulled a print
from the Sentra.

28:38.467 --> 28:41.011
Brandon Cleek, car thief.

28:41.053 --> 28:43.472
On parole, Imperial Valley.

28:43.514 --> 28:46.725
-Stay safe, brother.
-You, too.

28:49.520 --> 28:51.021
EDGAR:
Fentanyl.

28:51.063 --> 28:54.400
Maybe we should hit pause,
call in the DEA.

28:54.442 --> 28:58.737
Stick with the plan.

28:58.779 --> 28:59.947
Thanks, Jackie. That's terrific.

Cousin Rosie's away,
camping in the Cascades,

29:08.622 --> 29:11.083
-house is all shut up.
-But the utilities spiked?

29:11.125 --> 29:12.710
Been in triple digits up there

29:12.751 --> 29:14.378
How could Junior not use the AC?

29:14.420 --> 29:18.382
-Hmm.
-BPD found his car
two streets away.

29:18.424 --> 29:20.593
So Junior's in Bakersfield.

29:21.760 --> 29:23.721

29:23.762 --> 29:25.598
And where's his cousin Oscar?

29:25.639 --> 29:29.435
Mm... Maybe he's up there, too.

29:32.938 --> 29:36.192
He looked familiar, but so do
half the mooks on the street.

29:36.233 --> 29:39.403
An unarmed man lost his life.

29:39.445 --> 29:41.572
We need to understand
what happened.

29:43.407 --> 29:46.202

29:46.243 --> 29:49.205
Sir, I'm on the job ten years.

29:49.246 --> 29:52.041
Some nights it feels
like a war zone out there.

29:52.082 --> 29:54.293
And that night was one of them.

29:54.335 --> 29:56.003

Sir, what I'm saying is,

I don't precisely remember every
person I come in contact with.

30:10.684 --> 30:13.020

Okay, so walk me through it.

We expect there's a gun.
Multiple 911 calls.

on edge.
-Yes, sir.

30:27.785 --> 30:29.161
It was a volatile situation.

30:29.203 --> 30:31.121
Crowded, chaotic.

-Right away.

30:36.210 --> 30:39.505
He saw us first, started to run.

30:41.549 --> 30:44.969
If Vazquez was innocent,
then why'd he run?

30:45.010 --> 30:46.887
Pointless to speculate.

30:46.929 --> 30:50.182
I'm only interested in
your state of mind, officer.

30:50.224 --> 30:52.893
Feared for my life, sir.

30:52.935 --> 30:55.688

30:55.729 --> 30:58.440
In fear for my life.
