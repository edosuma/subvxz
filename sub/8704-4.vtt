sailing away from here for good.

00:19.430 --> 00:22.348
I stole it from you, the Urca gold.

<i>Whatever happens out here,</i>

00:24.385 --> 00:26.052
you and I would be
a hell of a lot better off

00:26.053 --> 00:28.054
as partners than as rivals.

00:28.055 --> 00:29.772
I will have a launch
ferry me to the sand alone,

00:29.773 --> 00:30.973
and I will make
the pardon address.

00:30.974 --> 00:32.558
It shouldn't be you.
If you send someone

00:32.558 --> 00:35.278
known to the men on
that beach, it might work.

00:35.279 --> 00:37.280
Be it proclaimed that

<i>All of you, that is, but one.</i>

00:43.404 --> 00:46.239
There shall be a bounty

Less so.

03:44.968 --> 03:47.669
You know, fresh water helps.

03:51.925 --> 03:54.927
The men have been asking questions.

03:54.928 --> 03:57.813
Soon we'll need an answer.

03:57.814 --> 04:00.149
What's next for us?

04:00.150 --> 04:04.457
I've been thinking about
our engagement with Captain Hornigold.

04:05.656 --> 04:09.108
He offered pardons to our entire crew.

04:09.109 --> 04:12.278
<i>He had no way of knowing</i>
<i>how many men we even had,</i>

04:12.279 --> 04:15.948
which suggests he had the number
covered by a wide margin.

04:15.949 --> 04:17.950
And once someone's given him 100,

04:17.951 --> 04:20.920
what's to say they
haven't given him 200?

04:20.921 --> 04:23.205
500? More?

04:23.206 --> 04:26.626
Go on.

04:26.627 --> 04:29.128
And Billy said something to me.

04:29.129 --> 04:33.349
Said that someone else likely
procured those pardons for Hornigold.

04:33.350 --> 04:35.301
<i>I started wondering.</i>

04:35.302 --> 04:38.354
<i>If you're Whitehall</i>
<i>and you have it in your head</i>

04:38.355 --> 04:41.390
you want to finally retake
Nassau from the pirates,

04:41.391 --> 04:44.644
isn't the opening move in that attack

04:44.645 --> 04:47.563
the introduction of a universal pardon?

04:47.564 --> 04:50.232
You been putting this
together all this time

04:50.233 --> 04:52.951
and never saying
anything to me about it?

04:54.655 --> 04:57.657
Well, you and I haven't exactly been

04:57.658 --> 04:59.492
on the warmest of terms lately.

04:59.493 --> 05:02.160
No, I... I suppose not.

05:04.298 --> 05:05.748
<i>Well, then it's clear.</i>

05:05.749 --> 05:10.836
The men must be prepared
to return to an embattled Nassau.

05:10.837 --> 05:14.840
They must know we're about to join
a fight to resist a British incursion.

05:14.841 --> 05:18.094
It's likely over already.

05:18.095 --> 05:21.514
The fight. If there was one at all.

05:21.515 --> 05:24.766
It's likely it didn't last long.

05:47.758 --> 05:49.342
(Gasps)

05:49.343 --> 05:52.345
The pardons will be tempting,

05:52.346 --> 05:53.929
but our men resisted.

05:53.930 --> 05:56.681
Our men resisted because
you and I told them to.

05:58.352 --> 06:01.270
<i>For whatever reason, when you
and I speak with one voice,</i>

06:01.271 --> 06:04.306
<i>we seem to be able</i>
<i>to compel them to any end.</i>

06:04.307 --> 06:09.228
But Nassau will not be able to
maintain that sort of resolve.

06:09.229 --> 06:11.980
Not without you or I there
to help instill it.

06:14.701 --> 06:17.235
How can you be so sure about this?

06:23.627 --> 06:26.294
<i>(Men murmuring)</i>

06:56.493 --> 06:59.077
(Men muttering)

07:14.594 --> 07:17.129
When I assembled my staff of
advisors for this enterprise,

07:17.130 --> 07:19.265
I spared no expense.

07:19.266 --> 07:21.350
Some of the most promising sons

07:21.351 --> 07:23.969
of the most prominent
families in London.

07:23.970 --> 07:26.722
Brilliant minds. Full of ambition.

07:26.723 --> 07:29.191
In this moment, I think it fair to say

07:29.192 --> 07:31.443
I wouldn't trade you
for any 10 of them.

07:33.864 --> 07:35.980
You're very kind.

07:37.033 --> 07:40.569
No, I'm very accountable.

07:40.570 --> 07:43.789
<i>By daybreak tomorrow, I'm told
more than half of the pirates</i>

07:43.790 --> 07:45.825
will have accepted the King's pardon

07:45.826 --> 07:48.627
and we will be ready to move
my flag onto the island.

07:48.628 --> 07:51.130
<i>In the 30 days that follow,</i>

07:51.131 --> 07:52.998
I will need to accomplish
90 days worth of progress

07:52.999 --> 07:55.217
just to keep schedule.

07:55.218 --> 07:57.670
I will need someone
by my side at all times

07:57.671 --> 07:59.672
to aid in seeing it done.

07:59.673 --> 08:04.093
A senior counselor
serving without portfolio.

08:04.094 --> 08:07.346
At the moment, I believe you
represent the best candidate for it.

08:07.347 --> 08:11.767
(Chuckles) Because I suggested
sending Hornigold to the beach?

08:11.768 --> 08:14.520
Because you're smart

08:14.521 --> 08:18.357
without needing anyone
to explain to you how to be.

08:18.358 --> 08:21.327
And because you're not afraid
of being thought to be wrong

08:21.328 --> 08:24.195
<i>when you know that you're right.</i>

08:25.582 --> 08:27.750
Won't the promising sons

08:27.751 --> 08:31.419
resent my presence
in such a senior capacity?

08:32.923 --> 08:35.174
I'm fairly certain I don't care.

08:35.174 --> 08:37.376
<i>Do you?</i>

08:37.376 --> 08:39.929
No.

08:39.929 --> 08:41.547
Good.

08:41.548 --> 08:43.515
Then you're hired.

08:43.517 --> 08:45.100

<i>MAN:</i>
<i>Look, sooner or later,</i>

09:05.539 --> 09:07.540
<i>there's gonna be 100 more</i>
<i>men out here, Jack,</i>

09:07.541 --> 09:10.242
<i>and this ain't gonna be</i>
<i>your decision anymore.</i>

09:10.243 --> 09:11.660
<i>(Men shouting)</i>

09:11.661 --> 09:13.711

<i>MAN:</i>
<i>What the fuck, Jack?</i>

09:32.349 --> 09:34.733
Paul something or other.

09:34.734 --> 09:39.321
- <i>MAN: Come on, Jack. Let us in.</i>
- Why just you?

09:39.322 --> 09:41.607
<i>Island full of murdering,</i>
<i>thieving fucks</i>

09:41.608 --> 09:44.693
and you were the only one
they can't forgive?

09:44.694 --> 09:47.279
How does that make any sense?

09:47.280 --> 09:49.365
I don't know.

09:49.366 --> 09:52.618
But whatever the reason,
the men behind that door

09:52.619 --> 09:55.337
will soon be joined by hundreds
more seeking the bounty.

09:55.338 --> 09:58.623
- In an hour.
- We'll be besieged.

10:03.880 --> 10:06.181
The men have cast their lots.

10:06.182 --> 10:08.968
They are resolved that
you convince Captain Vane

10:08.969 --> 10:10.936
to depart the fort.

10:10.937 --> 10:13.806
They believe that turning him over
might convince the British commander

10:13.807 --> 10:17.141
to allow them to keep
the fort and the gold.

10:18.194 --> 10:23.365
Safe to say the fight to defend Nassau
is off to an inauspicious beginning.

10:23.366 --> 10:25.567
Teach is still on the bay.

10:25.568 --> 10:27.786
There may yet be a way
to salvage some defense.

10:27.787 --> 10:28.987
It's over.

10:32.876 --> 10:35.960
It's over.

10:37.547 --> 10:42.918
Now all that remains is that
we escape this place and survive.

10:42.919 --> 10:45.004
All the doors are covered
by men seeking the bounty.

10:45.005 --> 10:47.423
And I have to imagine the tunnel
exits are being watched as well,

10:47.424 --> 10:49.475
given Hornigold's
familiarity with them.

10:49.476 --> 10:53.144
Then I suggest we
manufacture a new exit.

Freed a lot of them. Won't that

11:56.126 --> 11:59.244
We've sold more than we've
freed, and they know it.

11:59.245 --> 12:01.412
And even if we hadn't,
they'd assume we did.

12:02.382 --> 12:04.466

Quite right. Quick goodbye.
Last cigar. Surely you don't mind.

over your shoulder the whole time

someone else to take your place.

living as a target of his.

35:22.364 --> 35:25.783
Among them there is no
shortage of anger

35:25.784 --> 35:28.068
or hate or fear.

35:28.069 --> 35:30.037
Perhaps you have noticed.

35:30.038 --> 35:33.874
They have suffered cruelties
you cannot possibly imagine.

35:33.875 --> 35:36.494
Sisters separated from brothers.

35:36.495 --> 35:38.162
Husbands from their wives.

35:38.163 --> 35:40.998
Mothers from their sons.

35:40.999 --> 35:44.051
No one has greater cause
to swear England an enemy

35:44.052 --> 35:46.169
and desire vengeance
against her as we do.

35:48.423 --> 35:52.476
Yet I believe if we were offered
the same choice as yours faced,

35:52.477 --> 35:55.179
a chance to be made free
in the eyes of the law,

35:55.180 --> 35:58.399
it would not have been
so roundly rejected.

35:58.400 --> 36:01.734
I'm asking you
why you think that is.

36:04.356 --> 36:08.526
I'm very much aware my men's
lives hang in the balance.

36:08.527 --> 36:12.913
So I would like to give you the
answer you're looking for,

36:12.914 --> 36:15.198
but I don't think you're
going to want to hear it.

36:16.835 --> 36:18.836
Perhaps you are mistaken
in this moment

36:18.837 --> 36:21.288
as to which of the two of us
is in need of protection.

36:21.289 --> 36:23.957
Answer the question.

36:27.045 --> 36:30.381
Your men are filled
with anger towards England,

36:30.382 --> 36:32.766
as are mine,

36:32.767 --> 36:36.720
but my captain wanted
England to see that anger

36:36.721 --> 36:38.721
and make them fear it.

36:41.193 --> 36:43.477
And for whatever reason,

36:43.478 --> 36:47.113
your mother would prefer
your men fear England.

36:49.401 --> 36:51.150
I see.

36:54.706 --> 36:56.740
Take him back, please.

36:56.741 --> 36:58.909
You asked the question.
I answered.

36:58.910 --> 37:02.213
Wait a minute. Wait...
wait... wait a minute.

37:02.214 --> 37:06.383
I think you see our interests are more
closely aligned than your mother does.

37:06.384 --> 37:08.752
I have two dozen men
in a cage out there

37:08.753 --> 37:10.838
of the opinion that
she intends to kill us all

37:10.839 --> 37:13.307
sooner than later.

37:13.308 --> 37:17.093
And you're going to do
nothing about it?

37:22.350 --> 37:23.900
(Grunts)

37:38.500 --> 37:40.501
TEACH:
You done this before?

37:40.502 --> 37:42.086
VANE:
No, you?

37:42.087 --> 37:43.753
No.

37:46.925 --> 37:49.760
I suppose she's due some credit.

37:49.761 --> 37:52.129
Dragged off to London
in shackles

37:52.130 --> 37:55.516
and returns
in a governor's service.

37:55.517 --> 37:58.768
And convinces him to turn the
whole of the world against you.

38:01.473 --> 38:03.807
I don't doubt
your anger towards her,

38:03.808 --> 38:05.725
but I have to ask...

38:07.279 --> 38:09.530
if, in the course of our maneuver,

38:09.531 --> 38:12.866
we are forced to choose
between escape and her death,

38:12.867 --> 38:14.484
where are you?

38:16.154 --> 38:18.322
She was on that deck for a reason.

38:18.323 --> 38:19.957
So I'd see her.

38:19.958 --> 38:22.625
To provoke me into making a mistake.

38:25.964 --> 38:29.466
What matters most
is achieving our goal.

38:29.467 --> 38:32.636
To exit this bay
with the fleet intact

38:32.637 --> 38:36.173
and to move on from this place.

38:36.174 --> 38:38.058
Charles Vane sees past his anger

38:38.059 --> 38:40.259
to achieve the greater end.

38:41.846 --> 38:44.815
How did that happen?

38:44.816 --> 38:47.101
I was taught a lesson once.

38:47.102 --> 38:48.652
It's been effective.

38:48.653 --> 38:50.187
Taught by whom?

38:50.188 --> 38:51.522
Her.

38:51.523 --> 38:53.906
MAN:
It's ready.

39:02.083 --> 39:04.702
They are without option now.

39:04.703 --> 39:07.204
Sooner or later they'll
realize their only escape

39:07.205 --> 39:09.589
is to surrender
Captain Vane and stand down.

39:11.376 --> 39:14.210

39:53.334 --> 39:55.668

39:59.974 --> 40:02.259

40:02.260 --> 40:04.428
That I would turn on
anyone at any time,

40:04.429 --> 40:06.813
no matter how close
they were to me...

40:08.817 --> 40:12.319
no matter who it hurt
or how severely.

40:12.320 --> 40:13.771
That, given my history,

40:13.772 --> 40:15.938
only a fool would allow me
to get close to them again.

40:18.276 --> 40:20.576

may say of you.

40:42.550 --> 40:44.551

than charging into
a trap-laden forest.

to say that out loud.

Earlier I told you that I was certain

that the pardons would eliminate

46:04.288 --> 46:06.256
all resistance in Nassau

46:06.257 --> 46:09.458
and you asked me
how I was so certain.

46:14.132 --> 46:16.215
It's because I helped build them.

46:18.519 --> 46:23.140
Peter Ashe, Miranda,
her husband, and I,

46:23.141 --> 46:26.726
we worked to obtain
a universal pardon

46:26.727 --> 46:28.145
and introduce it to Nassau

46:28.146 --> 46:31.363
to eliminate piracy and
restore colonial rule there.

46:35.653 --> 46:39.156
I moved away from those things.

46:39.157 --> 46:42.492
Inch by inch,

46:42.493 --> 46:45.127
I forgot it all.

46:47.832 --> 46:51.418
And now, in this cage,

46:51.419 --> 46:53.804
in the belly of this thing

46:53.805 --> 46:56.005
that has swallowed us whole...

46:57.225 --> 46:59.759
I wonder...

46:59.760 --> 47:02.229
if the civilization of Nassau

47:02.230 --> 47:06.148
isn't exactly what I tried to
achieve all those years ago.

47:08.603 --> 47:13.190
If resisting it doesn't
set me in opposition

47:13.191 --> 47:17.409
to everything I once understood
to be good and right.

47:19.614 --> 47:22.165
To forgive.

47:22.166 --> 47:25.584
To make order of chaos.

47:28.956 --> 47:33.593
I wonder if the pardons
are the victory

47:33.594 --> 47:38.298
and that the most enlightened
thing that I can do is

47:38.299 --> 47:40.800
sit still.

47:40.801 --> 47:45.555
Accept what appears to be inevitable

47:45.556 --> 47:48.858
and let this be the end
of Captain Flint.

47:50.194 --> 47:52.779
No.

47:52.780 --> 47:56.950
No, no, no.
Nothing is inevitable here.

which we can survive this.

who leads this place

48:11.666 --> 48:14.217
is facing right now.

48:14.218 --> 48:18.889
The weight of her people's
welfare on her shoulders.

48:18.890 --> 48:22.091
She will not let us
leave this place alive.

48:24.095 --> 48:27.346
She simply won't permit it.

48:30.685 --> 48:32.319
We'll all face certain death

48:32.320 --> 48:34.153

Billy's is that he can
fight his way out of it.

talk your way past it.

- We share a common enemy.

- Madi!

49:32.380 --> 49:35.665
The men in that cage
are deceitful men.

49:35.666 --> 49:38.134
They will say things that
will sound appealing to you,

49:38.135 --> 49:41.221
especially to you.

49:41.222 --> 49:43.390
But you must not let them sway you.

49:43.391 --> 49:45.842
Your father and I built this place

49:45.843 --> 49:48.345

from their world.

49:48.346 --> 49:51.398
But we rely on the things that
father sends back from their world.

49:51.399 --> 49:52.983
We're not that separate from them.

49:52.984 --> 49:55.602
We are separate enough that
we have no need to see them.

49:55.603 --> 49:57.604
To steal from them.
To fight with them.

49:57.605 --> 49:59.355
To know their chains again.

50:02.743 --> 50:05.028
I have worked so hard

50:05.029 --> 50:07.914
to ensure that you've never
had to see those things.

50:07.915 --> 50:10.533
But I have seen those things.

50:10.534 --> 50:14.004
And I will hold them at bay
for as long as I'm able to.

50:14.005 --> 50:16.706
For every day that we avoid
colliding into their world

50:16.707 --> 50:18.341
is a day children are born here,

50:18.342 --> 50:22.045
<i>is a day families exist here.</i>

50:22.046 --> 50:24.881
I'm in no hurry to see that end.

50:24.882 --> 50:26.799
Nor should you be.

50:34.358 --> 50:37.193
Come.

50:37.194 --> 50:40.563
That separation rests entirely

50:40.564 --> 50:42.482
on our existence remaining a secret.

50:42.483 --> 50:45.285
The pirates, for as long
as they draw breath,

50:45.286 --> 50:47.153
could and would for a profit

50:47.154 --> 50:48.905
compromise that secret.

50:48.906 --> 50:52.125
So they must be eliminated.

50:52.126 --> 50:54.044
Why not consult father?

50:54.045 --> 50:55.912
You can get a message to him.

50:55.913 --> 50:57.997
He knows these men.
He sailed with them.

50:57.998 --> 51:00.500

to say about killing them.
