STEVEN SPIELBERG:
<i>I remember the first time I got to Kerner,</i>

00:23.148 --> 00:26.693
and the first time I saw,
you know, the fact they had

00:26.776 --> 00:28.903
really great junk food everywhere.

00:30.030 --> 00:33.575
<i>And I saw how really smart and creative</i>

00:33.658 --> 00:37.203
<i>and talented everybody was at ILM.</i>

00:38.329 --> 00:39.956
<i>It was all analog in those days.</i>

00:40.040 --> 00:42.167
<i>You did everything with your hands.</i>

00:42.292 --> 00:44.836
<i>I kind of looked at Kerner</i>
<i>as a kind of college campus</i>

00:44.919 --> 00:48.006
<i>in a way, it was like</i>
<i>we were a bunch of freshmen,</i>

00:48.131 --> 00:51.134
<i>and we were four years away</i>
<i>from graduating from anything.</i>

00:52.135 --> 00:53.595
Because we were all so young.

00:54.888 --> 00:58.892
<i>It was a great place to hang out</i>
<i>with a lot of like-minded people.</i>

00:59.642 --> 01:03.396
<i>We all love movies</i>
<i>and we loved talking about movies.</i>

01:03.855 --> 01:06.107
There was a sense
of nerdiness to all of us

01:06.191 --> 01:09.027
because it was ILM, not the NFL.

01:10.195 --> 01:11.946
<i>And that kind of mindset,</i>

01:12.030 --> 01:17.118
that kind of a fun house,
a playhouse for me,

01:17.202 --> 01:19.162
I never wanted to leave that place.

01:21.331 --> 01:24.334
<i>Because they understood how to make magic</i>

01:25.001 --> 01:26.628
<i>and how to have fun at the same time.</i>

02:28.898 --> 02:32.610
George showed up in Mobile, Alabama.
Right in the middle of <i>Close Encounters.</i>

02:32.694 --> 02:34.112
He had just finished <i>Star Wars.</i>

02:34.195 --> 02:37.198
And he had a terrible time on <i>Star Wars,</i>
at least you did in your head,

02:37.282 --> 02:39.117
<i>I don't know how bad it was in real life.</i>

02:39.200 --> 02:42.579
George was all depressed, saying,
"This is terrible, look at these stills.

02:42.704 --> 02:44.455
"Look how my movie's lit,
I'm really upset."

02:44.539 --> 02:46.416
I look at these stills
and it was gorgeous lighting.

02:46.499 --> 02:48.960
It was just incredible.
"God, George, you're depressed."

02:49.377 --> 02:50.920
<i>We had dinner at my house that night.</i>

02:51.004 --> 02:53.798
<i>He said, "This is terrible</i>
<i>and it wasn't what I wanted."</i>

02:53.923 --> 02:56.885
And we were sitting on the rocks
that are in <i>Close Encounters.</i>

02:56.968 --> 02:58.970
<i>I said, "Why don't we just trade a point?</i>

02:59.053 --> 03:00.638
"I'll give you a point
of <i>Close Encounters,</i>

03:00.722 --> 03:02.265

"And we'll see, we'll cover our bets,
you know?"

03:05.768 --> 03:09.856
Who was to know, George, that we were
gonna throw so much money away?

03:10.190 --> 03:13.902
Right. Well, I figured I had it made
because I felt, at that point,

03:13.985 --> 03:15.570
my picture was such a turkey.

03:17.155 --> 03:21.951
<i>Star Wars</i> was opening in May of 1977,

03:24.954 --> 03:28.082
<i>He said to me, "So what's the next movie</i>
<i>you're going to make?"</i>

03:28.249 --> 03:31.544

03:36.216 --> 03:39.052
No, Mr. Bond, I expect you to die.

03:39.135 --> 03:43.097
The second I said James Bond, he said,
"I got something better than James Bond."

03:45.558 --> 03:48.519
And he pitched me the story
called <i>Raiders of the Lost Ark.</i>

03:52.357 --> 03:55.235

a James Bond film for you.

<i>I had not been</i>
<i>in the business a long time,</i>

<i>to reading a lot of screenplays,</i>

05:20.820 --> 05:24.365
<i>and I remember sitting there</i>
<i>leafing through this.</i>

05:24.699 --> 05:27.869
I hadn't seen anything like this
in a movie before,

05:27.952 --> 05:31.080
<i>and I kind of closed it up and I sat back</i>

05:31.164 --> 05:36.961
and all I kept thinking to myself was,
"How are we going to do this?"

05:37.045 --> 05:39.839
(LAUGHING) It was so exciting.

05:40.798 --> 05:45.011
RICHARD EDLUND: Raiders <i>was kind of like</i>
<i>a bridge between fantasy and real movie.</i>

05:46.387 --> 05:50.141
So <i>Raiders</i> was, you know, I mean,
it was taking place in the Nazi era,

05:50.433 --> 05:54.854
<i>but the opening of the ark and all that</i>
<i>was still kind of fantasy world,</i>

05:54.979 --> 05:56.439
<i>you know, in a sense.</i>

05:56.522 --> 05:59.067
And so we had to make that work on screen.

05:59.275 --> 06:05.031
MAN: <i>You start to hear a rumble.</i>
<i>Almost like Old Faithful about to erupt.</i>

06:05.615 --> 06:07.784
<i>And the rumble increases,</i>
<i>the hum increases.</i>

06:08.493 --> 06:12.080
<i>And then,</i>
<i>the next phase of the effect occurs,</i>

06:12.163 --> 06:16.084
<i>which is where a rather gaseous,</i>
<i>a bluish-green gaseous veil</i>

06:16.709 --> 06:20.129
<i>spills from the ark and starts to crawl</i>
<i>down the steps.</i>

06:21.839 --> 06:24.675
It'll be between Steve
and the special effects

06:24.801 --> 06:30.765
and me workin' out the final decision
about how it's gonna finally look.

06:32.433 --> 06:35.395
<i>We're dealing with a kind of</i>
<i>special effect with a new look.</i>

06:36.938 --> 06:40.817
Something a little more ethereal than
what we've been doing in the past.

06:41.526 --> 06:43.403
RICHARD: <i>And shooting the ghosts</i>
<i>in</i> Raiders,

06:43.486 --> 06:46.739
<i>it's a real complicated issue</i>
<i>with that kind of a shot.</i>

06:46.864 --> 06:49.659
And when you're talking about
"What does a ghost look like?"

06:51.953 --> 06:54.622
LORNE PETERSON: <i>Steve Gawley came up</i>
<i>with a very clever idea.</i>

06:56.040 --> 07:00.503
Because we were using a cloud tank
to manufacture the clouds.

07:05.299 --> 07:10.596
<i>You use warm, clear water on the top</i>
<i>and salty water on the bottom that's cold.</i>

07:10.680 --> 07:12.432
<i>And so those layers would stay separate.</i>

07:12.515 --> 07:16.477
<i>And then you would inject</i>
<i>a mixed temperate with a little device,</i>

07:16.561 --> 07:19.772
<i>and then you would just wait</i>
<i>for the cumulus clouds to develop.</i>

07:19.939 --> 07:20.940
(THUNDER CRASHING)

07:21.983 --> 07:25.486
<i>So we have the tank available.</i>
<i>So Steve came up with the idea</i>

07:25.736 --> 07:28.614
of putting a rod on a ghost,
like a rod puppet,

07:28.906 --> 07:31.993
<i>and then he ran it in the water</i>
<i>and made it go back and forth.</i>

07:32.160 --> 07:37.123
And so the water made the silky tendrils,
like, flow really nicely

07:37.540 --> 07:39.375
<i>with silk and these tendrils,</i>

07:39.792 --> 07:43.379
and then it was shot high speed.
So it really slowed it down.

07:43.713 --> 07:47.216
<i>And then they could speed it up</i>
<i>and slow it down as they wanted to.</i>

07:48.259 --> 07:52.930
On <i>Raiders,</i> I was learning visual effects,
and I didn't even know...

07:53.014 --> 07:56.350
I knew what a matte painting was,
but I didn't know how you did it.

08:05.067 --> 08:08.321
<i>So it was really exciting for me</i>
<i>to go up to San Francisco</i>

08:08.821 --> 08:12.909
<i>and go to this sort of</i>
<i>nondescript industrial park.</i>

08:13.242 --> 08:15.286

08:36.349 --> 08:39.393

<i>sequences of storyboards.</i>

08:43.147 --> 08:44.398
"Make one sequence out of it.

<i>of what would actually be in the face</i>

09:16.305 --> 09:19.725
<i>out of this dental alginate, the thing,</i>
<i>the stuff that the dentist uses</i>

<i>to take molds of your teeth.</i>

<i>and by putting heat on this alginate,</i>
<i>it naturally melts.</i>

DENNIS: <i>I just looked for a way to be able</i>
<i>to feel something back from the shot.</i>

14:04.677 --> 14:06.178
Does the shot have energy?

14:07.304 --> 14:09.682

14:25.531 --> 14:26.532
(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)

14:26.615 --> 14:29.535
Thank you very much, Steven Spielberg,
for excellent direction.

14:29.618 --> 14:31.078
MAN: Thanks, Steven.

14:36.834 --> 14:40.129
KATHLEEN: <i>After that time,</i>
<i>almost everything we did</i>

14:40.212 --> 14:41.964
<i>was either with Dennis or Richard.</i>

14:42.381 --> 14:47.678
For me, Dennis is more a philosopher,
more of a dreamer.

14:48.178 --> 14:52.641
He kind of sits back
and sees things and make suggestions,

14:52.808 --> 14:55.269
whereas Richard is the doer.

14:55.352 --> 14:57.688
<i>He's on the set. He's there. He's framing.</i>

14:57.771 --> 14:59.481
<i>He's saying, "Try this, run in."</i>

14:59.773 --> 15:02.943
So one's soft and one's sort of hard,
I would say.

15:03.193 --> 15:05.821
Richard and Dennis are kids.

15:06.947 --> 15:10.618
<i>And it's just like hanging around</i>
<i>a gang of kids you love,</i>

15:10.701 --> 15:13.162
<i>you want to grow old with,</i>
<i>you want to grow up with.</i>

15:13.245 --> 15:16.582
<i>And Dennis, his nature is very E.T.-like.</i>

15:17.750 --> 15:21.211
And Richard's nature is very, very
<i>Poltergeist-like.</i>

15:27.009 --> 15:28.761
They're here.

15:29.720 --> 15:33.390
(LAUGHS) Richard loves scary movies,

15:33.474 --> 15:36.352
and he loves creating scares.
He's so great at it.

15:36.435 --> 15:38.020
He has a diabolical imagination

15:38.103 --> 15:41.106
when it comes to putting things
on the screen that will scare you.

15:55.454 --> 15:57.456
FRANK: <i>Richard and I got along very well.</i>

15:57.581 --> 16:01.710
You know, each visual effects supervisor
is like a mini director,

16:02.127 --> 16:04.004
<i>and they have their team around them.</i>

16:04.296 --> 16:07.216
RICHARD: <i>We didn't have time</i>
<i>to do any design work up front,</i>

16:07.299 --> 16:08.842
<i>so we went into the movie</i>

16:09.259 --> 16:12.638
not knowing what we were going to shoot
next for visual effects.

16:13.347 --> 16:18.602
There were a lot of visual effects that
were combined with the physical effects.

16:19.353 --> 16:21.855

LORNE: <i>We made this esophagus and</i>
<i>it was all suspended with bungee cord,</i>

16:34.994 --> 16:37.621
and all flexible pieces
of rubber and all that stuff.

16:37.705 --> 16:41.917
<i>And Paul Huston made this device</i>
<i>with a keyboard like a piano,</i>

16:42.084 --> 16:44.378
<i>and it caused the esophagus to undulate.</i>

16:44.920 --> 16:48.257
So, Spielberg said, "Oh, my God,
How is that happening?"

16:48.340 --> 16:51.760
<i>And so he says, "I want to see it.</i>
<i>I want to see how that's done."</i>

16:51.844 --> 16:54.471
And so he goes around behind,
he sees the keyboard and says,

16:54.555 --> 16:56.682
"Oh, man, I want to play this thing,"
you know, so...

16:56.890 --> 16:58.726
(MIMICS KEYBOARD SOUNDS)

16:58.809 --> 17:01.770
<i>So it was a playdate for Spielberg.</i>

17:01.854 --> 17:05.232
Numbers of playdates that he would come
to ILM to have fun, I think.

17:06.817 --> 17:08.652
RICHARD: <i>I was reading the script</i>

17:08.777 --> 17:12.948
and I'm coming along and all of a sudden,
"And the house implodes."

17:13.949 --> 17:17.202
I'm thinking, hmm... (CHUCKLES)
that's not explode.

17:17.286 --> 17:18.495
Exploding is easy.

17:19.079 --> 17:20.581
Imploding is something else.

17:20.873 --> 17:24.710
I called Frank and I said, "Frank,
you know, this is a $250,000 sentence."

17:24.918 --> 17:26.003
(CHUCKLES)

17:26.086 --> 17:29.840
That was, I think,
the most difficult shot in the movie.

17:29.923 --> 17:31.425
LORNE: <i>Spielberg was here one day,</i>

17:31.508 --> 17:34.553
there was about 12 of us
various departments sat around.

17:34.636 --> 17:36.472
He would just go through page after page

17:36.555 --> 17:38.849
and say, "This looks like
a matte painting to me."

17:38.932 --> 17:40.476
Camera? (SPEAKS GIBBERISH)

17:40.559 --> 17:43.479
And then he turned the page
and it was the imploding house.

17:43.645 --> 17:46.398
And he said, "Lorne,
looks like that's a model.

17:46.482 --> 17:48.942
"What do you want to do about imploding?"

17:49.068 --> 17:51.779
And I'd been thinking about imploding,
and someone actually

17:51.862 --> 17:54.490
came up to me and said,
"Well, why don't you just blow it up

17:54.573 --> 17:55.949
"and put the film backwards?"

17:56.033 --> 17:57.701
(EXPLOSION)

17:58.702 --> 18:00.621
And I said, "That isn't imploding."
(LAUGHS)

18:00.704 --> 18:04.458
You can't do that, it needs to implode.

18:04.875 --> 18:11.799
So I said, "Well, we'll do it much
like a magician takes a wand,

18:11.882 --> 18:14.760
"his magic wand, and shakes it
and a bouquet comes out."

18:15.511 --> 18:17.805
<i>We'll make the bouquet</i>
<i>go back into the wand.</i>

18:18.680 --> 18:20.516
He goes, "Okay, next page."

18:21.600 --> 18:24.478
RICHARD: <i>We had lots of different problems</i>

18:24.603 --> 18:26.939
<i>because it took place</i>
<i>in your neighbor's house.</i>

18:27.564 --> 18:30.109
So everything you did had to look real.

18:30.943 --> 18:32.027
And what is real?

18:36.198 --> 18:40.202
<i>We built a miniature of the house</i>
<i>about 42 inches wide,</i>

18:40.702 --> 18:44.957
<i>with a garage, and inside the garage</i>
<i>is all the stuff you find in a garage.</i>

18:45.040 --> 18:47.793
It had little bicycles in the inside,
it had lawnmowers.

18:47.876 --> 18:50.712
Rakes. There was furniture
inside the house.

18:51.004 --> 18:54.591
FRANK: <i>A visual effects shot</i>
<i>is only as good as what's put into it.</i>

18:54.925 --> 18:58.804
<i>You need to have the details,</i>
<i>so there's a lot of things that happen</i>

18:58.887 --> 19:00.139
<i>by accident.</i>

19:00.222 --> 19:02.724
Dust, impact, splinters.

19:02.850 --> 19:05.227
It's those accidents
that make it feel real.

19:05.811 --> 19:08.188
RICHARD: <i>We did all kinds of tests</i>
<i>of different materials</i>

19:08.272 --> 19:09.314
<i>that you could pull apart.</i>

19:09.398 --> 19:12.109
LORNE: <i>It was built out of balsa wood</i>
<i>and then paper,</i>

19:12.568 --> 19:14.736
and I soaked them in bleach and water,

19:14.945 --> 19:18.740
and I put lead weights on top
to weight it down 24 hours

19:18.866 --> 19:21.660
<i>so that the balsa wood lost its energy</i>

19:21.743 --> 19:25.455
and broke down the surface tension
so that they would snap like pasta does.

19:28.083 --> 19:32.212
RICHARD: <i>And so this model was built,</i>
<i>a couple months' work,</i>

19:32.504 --> 19:34.715
<i>and we we're going to</i>
<i>basically pull it apart.</i>

19:34.882 --> 19:37.467
<i>And we're using hundreds</i>
<i>of pieces of piano wire</i>

19:37.885 --> 19:39.595
<i>attached to pieces of the model.</i>

19:44.349 --> 19:47.561
<i>And we tip the house</i>
<i>and flip it on its back,</i>

19:47.644 --> 19:49.521
<i>and it's all on this big structure.</i>

19:52.441 --> 19:56.028
<i>Have the camera up on the top,</i>
<i>looking down at the front of this house.</i>

19:58.864 --> 20:03.202
<i>And this whole mass of wires</i>
<i>were attached to a forklift.</i>

20:03.994 --> 20:07.372
<i>The idea was the forklift</i>
<i>was going to take off,</i>

20:08.081 --> 20:10.959
<i>and at a certain point,</i>
<i>it's going to just pull this thing over.</i>

20:11.919 --> 20:13.754
And I had a pair of shotguns, right?

20:15.797 --> 20:17.507
Bond's... Good English guns, right?

20:18.175 --> 20:19.551
<i>The shotguns were to help it.</i>

20:19.760 --> 20:20.928
(GUNSHOTS)

20:21.011 --> 20:25.140
To help it down into the hole because it
all had to be pulled down into this hole

20:25.224 --> 20:26.808
that was about this big.

20:27.643 --> 20:29.603
<i>And this is a one-trick baby.</i>

20:29.686 --> 20:32.272
I mean, to do this again
would have been another

20:32.356 --> 20:35.108
50, 60 grand or something, at least.

20:54.670 --> 20:58.257
Originally, ILM was just put together
for George Lucas' movies.

20:58.423 --> 21:00.634
But then, in order to keep it together

21:00.717 --> 21:03.887
while he was writing,
he opened it up to his friends.

21:03.971 --> 21:06.556
So Steven Spielberg was able
to make movies here

21:06.640 --> 21:08.016
<i>and a few other of his friends.</i>

21:08.225 --> 21:13.814
But I think <i>Star Trek</i> was the first
non-friend that was allowed in the shop.

21:13.939 --> 21:18.944
My first supervisory job was
on <i>Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan.</i>

21:21.655 --> 21:24.199
<i>And that was all very exciting for me.</i>

21:25.158 --> 21:27.911
And it also was very different
in a lot of ways.

21:28.245 --> 21:31.999
<i>On that show, digital started</i>
<i>to creep in with Ed Catmull.</i>

21:33.125 --> 21:36.878
In the early days of
computer graphics at ILM,

21:37.004 --> 21:39.464
<i>the work that we were doing was not</i>

21:39.548 --> 21:43.677
obviously going to be a benefit to them
because initially we did not have

21:43.760 --> 21:47.389
nearly enough compute power
to make images that were good enough.

21:47.472 --> 21:52.602
<i>But as we got closer, we began to produce</i>
<i>something that did have an impact.</i>

21:53.395 --> 21:57.274
Computer, request access
to Project Genesis summary.

21:57.858 --> 21:59.985
FEMALE VOICE: <i>What exactly is "Genesis"?</i>

22:00.444 --> 22:01.903
They had an effect

22:01.987 --> 22:07.909
which required that they demonstrate
this ability to transform a planet

22:07.993 --> 22:09.995
or to create life
where there wasn't anything.

22:10.495 --> 22:12.998
<i>But it was meant to be, in the movie,</i>

22:13.206 --> 22:16.251
<i>a simulation, which meant it</i>
<i>didn't have to look completely real.</i>

22:16.543 --> 22:19.880
Just had to be a really
interesting-looking visual effect.

22:22.090 --> 22:25.927
<i>So at this point we could begin to</i>
<i>show off the various things that we had.</i>

22:27.387 --> 22:29.931
<i>We started off with this planet,</i>

22:31.308 --> 22:35.103
<i>and there's this wave of fire</i>
<i>was sweeping by.</i>

22:36.104 --> 22:38.482
These mountains grew up,
these fractal mountains,

22:40.067 --> 22:45.197
<i>and then the green and the foliage grows</i>
<i>and morphs as it created a life.</i>

22:46.114 --> 22:49.659
ILM was all excited about this. People
hadn't seen anything like it before.

22:50.494 --> 22:53.538
KEN: <i>There was something interesting</i>
<i>about creating an entire sequence</i>

22:53.663 --> 22:56.208
<i>using computer imagery.</i>

22:56.958 --> 22:58.335
<i>It certainly doesn't look real,</i>

22:58.418 --> 23:00.629
<i>and it didn't need</i>
<i>to look real for the movie,</i>

23:00.712 --> 23:03.924
but it was a very different approach
to how things could be done,

23:04.007 --> 23:06.760
and it makes you start to think
about what benefits can come

23:06.885 --> 23:08.970
from doing something with that technology.

23:19.022 --> 23:22.401
That was the beginning
of our doing work for other people.

<i>We needed to keep people working</i>
<i>and not lose them,</i>

23:26.363 --> 23:28.323

26:34.593 --> 26:39.097
<i>The collaboration</i>
<i>and the teamwork was king here.</i>

26:41.516 --> 26:43.685
<i>But it wasn't just</i>
<i>the three effects supervisors,</i>

26:43.768 --> 26:47.564
<i>they would each listen to their crew</i>
<i>and get ideas and try things.</i>

26:48.773 --> 26:50.900
<i>Every department had their own character.</i>

26:52.736 --> 26:54.404
<i>There were not a lot of egos.</i>

27:08.251 --> 27:09.336
PHIL: <i>That was our family.</i>

27:09.836 --> 27:12.088
We just really enjoyed
each other's company.

27:15.175 --> 27:17.385
The first time I laid eyes
on Dennis Muren,

27:17.677 --> 27:21.723
<i>he was screening a movie</i>
<i>that he had made called</i> Equinox.

27:21.848 --> 27:23.183
MAN: <i>Equinox.</i>

27:27.562 --> 27:29.773
-(GROWLS)
-(SCREAMING)

27:32.984 --> 27:35.987
So that's how I got to know Dennis.
(LAUGHS)

27:38.907 --> 27:40.867
DENNIS: <i>Phil was probably</i>
<i>five years younger than I am.</i>

27:41.951 --> 27:45.205
<i>We used to get together and look</i>
<i>at the big movies that were being made,</i>

27:45.288 --> 27:50.460
and... (LAUGHS) most of the time I would
say, "I don't think they did that right.

27:51.127 --> 27:54.005
<i>"You know, those effects</i>
<i>do not look very good."</i>

27:55.006 --> 27:57.926
PHIL: <i>We'd sit around drinking beer</i>
<i>in my little apartment</i>

27:58.009 --> 28:01.554
in Venice, California,
talking about what we wanted to do.

28:02.097 --> 28:05.058
<i>In fact, when my wife, Jules,</i>
<i>proposed to me,</i>

28:05.141 --> 28:07.852
<i>it was on Dennis' balcony in Glendale.</i>

28:09.187 --> 28:12.816
<i>And then he and Jules and I</i>
<i>were up in the Bay Area</i>

28:12.899 --> 28:17.362
at the Berkeley Art Museum,
and this woman walks by and then Jules

28:17.445 --> 28:19.739
and the woman turn and look at each other.

28:20.824 --> 28:25.078
And it was a woman that Jules had gone
to art school with in England.

28:25.328 --> 28:27.247
Her name was Zara Pinfold,

28:27.330 --> 28:30.166
and she and Jules
had gone to college together.

28:30.250 --> 28:34.129
PHIL: <i>She ended up marrying Dennis.</i>
(LAUGHING) <i>That's where they met.</i>

28:34.212 --> 28:38.091
DENNIS: <i>So, our relationship</i>
<i>between Phil and Jules and Zara</i>

28:38.216 --> 28:40.677
and mine is very tight. Very tight.

28:40.760 --> 28:43.471
Yeah, we're, you know, pretty... Family.

28:43.847 --> 28:46.975
<i>And we worked together</i>
<i>really well, you know.</i>

28:49.686 --> 28:50.854
<i>For rancor,</i>

28:51.104 --> 28:56.401
<i>I imagined it as a cross</i>
<i>between a bear and a potato,</i>

28:58.486 --> 28:59.738
and I just ran with that.

29:02.866 --> 29:06.870
<i>George accepted the first design</i>
<i>and, you know, just refined it.</i>

29:08.121 --> 29:11.207
GEORGE: <i>You know, the designs themselves</i>
<i>were mostly artwork.</i>

29:12.292 --> 29:13.334
It was brilliant.

29:13.418 --> 29:15.003
It might be good, just as a...

29:15.086 --> 29:17.464
PHIL: <i>I had designed it</i>
<i>as a stop motion character,</i>

29:17.714 --> 29:22.635
but George said he wanted to do it as...
The way he characterized it

29:22.719 --> 29:24.721
was "the best Godzilla suit ever."

29:25.764 --> 29:30.560
<i>And so we have the whole Creature Shop</i>
<i>for all the creatures in Jabba's palace</i>

29:30.643 --> 29:34.981
<i>that we were doing,</i>
<i>and we built a rancor costume</i>

29:35.356 --> 29:36.566
<i>for someone to fit in.</i>

29:38.735 --> 29:44.032
<i>And it just didn't work.</i>

29:45.408 --> 29:48.495
<i>So it was Dennis' idea to do it</i>
<i>as a high-speed puppet.</i>

29:50.705 --> 29:53.374
DENNIS: <i>We went with just a real</i>
<i>smaller rod puppet.</i>

29:54.083 --> 29:57.253
<i>Building little tiny skeletons</i>
<i>that you can move around.</i>

30:05.011 --> 30:09.140
<i>And we made a whole miniature set</i>
<i>that it was in, all sorts of stuff</i>

30:09.224 --> 30:11.643
to make it look big
and like a professional movie

30:11.726 --> 30:13.478
instead of a bunch of kids having fun.

30:15.605 --> 30:18.900
<i>The arms were controlled separately</i>
<i>from rods coming out of the elbows,</i>

30:18.983 --> 30:21.611
<i>going down with guys down below,</i>
<i>moving those around.</i>

30:28.576 --> 30:30.328
PHIL: <i>To move the thing,</i>

30:30.578 --> 30:33.289
the performances, there's me,

30:33.373 --> 30:36.042
I've got my hand up his ass
doing his head.

30:38.628 --> 30:41.881
<i>There's a guy, Tom St. Amand,</i>
<i>with the kind of pistol grips</i>

30:41.965 --> 30:45.510
<i>that we had hidden, blacked out,</i>
<i>that would operate the hands.</i>

30:47.929 --> 30:50.557
<i>Another guy under the table</i>
<i>that were doing the feet.</i>

30:54.060 --> 30:58.189
<i>Some scenes we shot at 72 frames</i>
<i>a second, three times faster.</i>

30:58.273 --> 30:59.732
<i>Camera would get up to speed,</i>

31:03.528 --> 31:05.530
and we just go...
(MAKES SWISHING SOUND) Like that.

31:09.325 --> 31:11.077
(GROWLING)

31:12.662 --> 31:14.080
And...

31:15.582 --> 31:17.458
(LAUGHS) Who knows?

31:17.876 --> 31:22.005
<i>And so, uh, we would do a lot of takes.</i>

31:24.966 --> 31:26.593
DENNIS: <i>All the time, we're saying,</i>

31:26.718 --> 31:29.888
<i>"What can we do to make it</i>
<i>not look like a Muppet, right?"</i>

31:29.971 --> 31:31.514
Well, let's try it backwards.

31:31.681 --> 31:33.892
Let's try it backwards at a slow speed

31:34.017 --> 31:36.853
<i>and see if when we run it forward</i>
<i>instead of backwards,</i>

31:36.936 --> 31:40.106
<i>see what we get then. We tried that.</i>
<i>I think that's in the film.</i>

31:45.486 --> 31:49.198
All right, now, here's the shot
that has to be done with taste.

31:49.324 --> 31:52.660
'Cause what we're gonna do on this cut
is as the jaws come down,

31:52.744 --> 31:55.496
he's squealing like mad on the cut. Here.

31:55.663 --> 31:57.665
(SQUEALING, CRUNCHES)

31:58.416 --> 32:01.544
-Crunch.
-Yeah, the squealing will stop, so...

32:01.711 --> 32:02.712
(CHUCKLES)

32:02.795 --> 32:05.798
As he starts chewing and then
what he does at the very end,

32:05.882 --> 32:09.302
then he turns toward you, sees Luke,
(IMITATES SLURPING)

32:09.469 --> 32:11.137
and then starts to move forward.

32:11.512 --> 32:13.222
(SQUEALING)

32:15.141 --> 32:16.643
(LAUGHS)

32:16.726 --> 32:20.355
On <i>Return of the Jedi,</i>
we were all working right there,

32:20.688 --> 32:21.898
you know, in close proximity.

32:21.981 --> 32:23.733
So I could go into the cutting room

32:23.900 --> 32:27.403
<i>if George wanted change a sequence</i>
<i>and he would explain to me,</i>

32:27.487 --> 32:29.322
<i>"I'm going to throw out these shots,</i>

32:29.405 --> 32:31.532
<i>"but we need a shot to replace them</i>
<i>that does this."</i>

32:31.699 --> 32:35.703
It was George sort of guiding us
and steering us.

32:37.664 --> 32:39.916
MAN: Rebels, we'd better
report to the base.

32:40.583 --> 32:42.919
(ENGINES ACCELERATING)

32:50.009 --> 32:51.970
(GUN FIRING)

32:53.137 --> 32:55.723
DENNIS: <i>George was asking</i>
<i>to come up with ideas</i>

32:55.807 --> 32:59.268
for the sequence for the bike chase
so he would have something to cut to.

32:59.352 --> 33:02.563
And you're looking at it like,
you know, he said three minutes long.

33:02.647 --> 33:05.024
<i>Here's what happens roughly,</i>
<i>but do whatever you want.</i>

33:06.734 --> 33:09.362
<i>So he decided to shoot</i>
<i>an animatic for that.</i>

33:09.445 --> 33:12.156
<i>But just do it really cheap</i>
<i>and with little dolls.</i>

33:12.490 --> 33:16.369
MAN: Okay. Are we ready?
Hey, Joe, can you pull cable on this?

33:20.915 --> 33:22.083
Ninety-five.

33:23.292 --> 33:26.170
JOE: <i>It was an awful lot</i>
<i>of trial and error at ILM.</i>

33:26.254 --> 33:29.257
But for me, there's always
a lot of right ways to do it,

33:29.340 --> 33:31.092
and there's a lot of wrong ways to do it.

33:31.175 --> 33:34.345
Maybe, like we did in the other shot
where if I hit that bike,

33:34.429 --> 33:36.305
it moves your hand and the camera.

33:37.890 --> 33:41.394
And it's like,
"What's the best right way to do it?"

33:42.020 --> 33:43.771
And, action.

33:43.938 --> 33:45.815
DENNIS: <i>It's instinctive, it's not logic.</i>

33:45.898 --> 33:49.193
<i>As much as I've tried to figure it out,</i>
<i>it still really isn't logical.</i>

33:49.318 --> 33:50.528
Can you get closer together?

33:50.611 --> 33:52.155
<i>Effects work is really grueling,</i>

33:52.238 --> 33:55.450
<i>and it's hard on everybody doing it</i>
<i>and it has to be so precise.</i>

33:55.825 --> 33:58.995
<i>But there definitely is something</i>
<i>in the process that I really enjoyed.</i>

33:59.120 --> 34:00.121
Action.

34:01.164 --> 34:04.083
(DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING)

34:08.087 --> 34:12.216
We used this little animatic
as our guide for the final shots.

34:14.343 --> 34:16.637
(ENGINE ROARING)

34:18.014 --> 34:21.642
And I could go and look at each angle
and come up with different ways

34:21.726 --> 34:23.686
<i>that we could shoot the whole sequence.</i>

34:27.607 --> 34:29.650
<i>And so it all became manageable.</i>

34:31.527 --> 34:34.072
(MUSIC CONTINUES)

34:55.718 --> 34:57.345
-Got it? Do we have it?
-Yep.

34:57.428 --> 34:59.055
Wanna do one more? Or do we have it?

34:59.180 --> 35:01.057
-You're right, we've got it. Onward!
-(LAUGHS)

35:01.140 --> 35:02.558
I don't know what else we could do.

35:02.642 --> 35:05.269
-Okay, terrific.
-Well, perfect. That's it. Next shot.

35:05.937 --> 35:10.608
<i>Jedi,</i> for its time, it had 900 and some
visual effect shots.

35:11.025 --> 35:15.780
It was the most complicated color visual
effects movie even conceived of.

35:29.335 --> 35:34.298
But I think that as ILM evolved
and as <i>The Empire Strikes Back</i>

35:34.382 --> 35:36.217
<i>and</i> Return of the Jedi <i>came along,</i>

35:36.592 --> 35:39.804
it got harder and harder
to maintain that essence

35:39.929 --> 35:43.599
of what ILM was at the very beginning
because we were trying to repeat it.

35:43.683 --> 35:46.185
We were trying to create
something that was better.

35:47.895 --> 35:50.439
<i>And I had had enough.</i>
<i>Man, I was burned out.</i>

35:53.693 --> 35:55.027
RICHARD: Jedi <i>was not fun.</i>

35:55.736 --> 36:00.241
<i>Jedi</i> was nose to the grindstone,
and we did it in record time.

36:02.326 --> 36:04.787
KEN: <i>Late in the game,</i>
<i>there was cut of the movie,</i>

36:05.163 --> 36:08.166
George wasn't thrilled
with some of the sequences in it.

36:08.916 --> 36:11.752
<i>And he re-cut and lost a lot of shots.</i>

36:12.003 --> 36:14.714
The problem I have with this
is that it's too static.

36:15.882 --> 36:17.550
KEN: <i>We were pretty frayed.</i>

36:18.176 --> 36:21.512
<i>Beating ourselves up anyway,</i>
<i>just to get the movie done in time.</i>

36:22.430 --> 36:26.350
<i>As our shots go into the toilet,</i>
<i>the depressing feeling</i>

36:26.434 --> 36:29.478
<i>goes through you, then you get pissed off.</i>

36:29.896 --> 36:32.607
Like, after all that work
and these late nights...

36:35.067 --> 36:39.447
People require recognition
for what they're giving.

36:42.116 --> 36:48.414
After <i>Jedi,</i> Richard Edlund chose to leave
and start his own company, Boss Film.

36:48.915 --> 36:52.210
<i>It felt that ILM was becoming</i>
<i>a little too corporate.</i>

36:52.919 --> 36:57.673
And the gestalt in the company was
not as much fun as it as it used to be.

36:59.383 --> 37:01.344
CHRISSIE: <i>After</i> Jedi,
<i>we did a really big layoff.</i>

37:01.427 --> 37:03.429
<i>That was really difficult.</i>

37:04.972 --> 37:09.060
Some people never came back.
Some people left earlier.

37:09.977 --> 37:11.729
<i>So that was a difficult time.</i>

37:13.272 --> 37:15.149
Light it up. Okay, lights up, Phil.

37:15.900 --> 37:17.860
ROSE:<i> But we still had the infrastructure.</i>

37:18.277 --> 37:19.820
<i>We still had George.</i>

37:19.904 --> 37:24.951
<i>We still had Dennis and Ken and other</i>
<i>up-and-coming effects supervisors.</i>

37:25.451 --> 37:27.745
We all knew we'd be okay.

37:27.954 --> 37:30.081
Good. Right here. Everybody, right here.

37:30.164 --> 37:32.708
STEVEN: <i>There was nobody else</i>
<i>I wanted to give my films to.</i>

37:32.833 --> 37:35.628
No one else I trusted as much as ILM.

37:35.711 --> 37:38.547
<i>We had a lot of work,</i>
<i>and we were making a lot of movies.</i>

37:38.923 --> 37:41.259
Indiana Jones. Goonies.

37:41.384 --> 37:43.469
<i>The</i> Back to the Future <i>films.</i>

37:49.517 --> 37:51.936
ILM was the place.

37:52.395 --> 37:54.313
I mean, there was just
no discussion about it.

37:54.397 --> 37:57.275
You know, that's where you want
to do your visual effects.

38:04.073 --> 38:08.160
It was super charged with energy,
and it was like a mutual kind of,

38:08.411 --> 38:12.456
"Yeah, let's do something that no one's
ever seen before" attitude.

38:20.298 --> 38:23.509
RON HOWARD: <i>In the early mid-'80s,</i>
<i>when I was there working on</i> Cocoon,

38:23.634 --> 38:26.554
<i>the vibe at ILM was this sort of</i>

38:26.637 --> 38:33.144
intersection of a kind of
loosey goosey intellectualism

38:33.728 --> 38:40.109
<i>and real outlier thinking,</i>
<i>and enough angsty nerdy need</i>

38:41.277 --> 38:44.572
to sort of be a part
of something that created

38:44.655 --> 38:47.616
<i>a certain kind of energy,</i>
<i>you know, of innovation.</i>

38:56.250 --> 38:59.712
JOE: <i>We had just finished</i>
Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom,

38:59.795 --> 39:02.590
<i>and I made an appointment</i>
<i>to talk to George.</i>

39:02.923 --> 39:05.509
I said, "George, I'm done.

39:07.345 --> 39:09.013
<i>"I can't draw another storyboard.</i>

39:09.680 --> 39:11.932
<i>"I don't want to see</i>
<i>another visual effect.</i>

39:12.016 --> 39:15.603
"You know, I'm gonna take some of this
money that I haven't been able to spend

39:15.686 --> 39:18.939
"'cause we've been working back to back
and I'm going to just...

39:19.023 --> 39:20.566
"I'm going to travel the world

39:20.649 --> 39:23.152
"and I'm going to see some stuff
and go places."

39:23.235 --> 39:25.363
And he was silent for a bit.

39:26.364 --> 39:28.783
He was thinking,
I could see he was thinking.

39:28.866 --> 39:32.078
He was focused on something. He said,
"Wouldn't you rather go to film school?"

39:33.245 --> 39:38.876
<i>And I said, "George, I feel like I've been</i>
<i>in film school for the last ten years."</i>

39:40.378 --> 39:44.006
He said, "If you want to go to USC,
I'll pay your tuition,

39:44.215 --> 39:46.175
"I'll keep you on half salary,

39:47.134 --> 39:50.096
"and I'll see to it that you can
take any classes you want."

39:50.471 --> 39:52.973
I mean, how could you turn down
that kind of offer?

39:55.518 --> 40:00.773
<i>The film I made at USC got me the job</i>
<i>on</i> Honey, I Shrunk the Kids.

40:01.315 --> 40:03.901
Now, I have a feeling that at some point,

40:04.485 --> 40:07.530
<i>George called Disney</i>
<i>and said, "This kid can do it."</i>

40:07.947 --> 40:11.617
No! Don't eat me! (SCREAMING)

40:12.201 --> 40:14.537
-Aah!
-(DOG BARKS)

40:17.748 --> 40:19.083
It was just generosity.

40:19.166 --> 40:22.211
I mean, how do you repay
somebody for that?

40:24.463 --> 40:27.049
<i>And I have been able to take that</i>

40:27.133 --> 40:32.346
<i>and parlay it into a pretty great</i>
<i>career, in my opinion.</i>

40:33.722 --> 40:36.475
<i>I feel very fortunate</i>
<i>when I look back at the things I've done.</i>

40:38.060 --> 40:40.604
And the fact that I know visual effects,

40:42.064 --> 40:45.985
that's something that I can hand
to a really talented guy,

40:46.068 --> 40:48.195
and I don't have
to worry about it anymore.

40:50.281 --> 40:53.451
JOHN: <i>When I first heard about ILM,</i>
<i>these were my heroes.</i>

40:55.369 --> 40:58.914
You know, maybe someday I'll do work
kind of like these guys.

41:04.670 --> 41:05.963
<i>I grew up in Ann Arbor.</i>

41:08.466 --> 41:12.178
<i>My dad was a nuclear engineering professor</i>
<i>at the University of Michigan.</i>

41:12.428 --> 41:14.597
Hello, I'm Glen Knoll,
chairman of the Department

41:14.680 --> 41:17.349
of Nuclear Engineering
at the University of Michigan.

41:17.433 --> 41:22.229
JOHN: <i>I grew up in a family of scientists,</i>
<i>engineers and medical professionals.</i>

41:23.606 --> 41:27.693
<i>I was a science fiction nerd, but I also</i>
<i>like doing things with my hands.</i>

41:27.776 --> 41:30.738
<i>I did woodworking,</i>
<i>clay animation, model making.</i>

41:31.113 --> 41:36.035
I taught myself basic digital and analog
electronics and things like that.

41:40.247 --> 41:43.542
<i>I grew up during the golden era</i>
<i>of space exploration</i>

41:43.667 --> 41:46.003
<i>during the Gemini and Apollo programs.</i>

41:46.128 --> 41:49.798
<i>And I still remember</i>
<i>being wide-eyed and breathless</i>

41:49.882 --> 41:52.510
<i>watching Neil Armstrong land on the moon.</i>

41:52.927 --> 41:54.011
<i>That was a big deal.</i>

41:54.762 --> 41:57.848
Here we are, human beings,
sending people to the moon.

41:58.390 --> 42:00.142
What a fabulous age we live in.

42:03.145 --> 42:06.732
<i>What really cemented my commitment</i>
<i>to wanting to go into film</i>

42:06.815 --> 42:13.447
was a fortuitous business trip
that my dad had in May of 1978.

42:13.531 --> 42:15.407
So about a year after <i>Star Wars</i> came out.

42:15.491 --> 42:18.118
<i>He had a Society</i>
<i>of Nuclear Medicine conference</i>

42:18.202 --> 42:21.038
<i>that was being held</i>
<i>at Anaheim Convention Center,</i>

42:21.455 --> 42:26.001
<i>and he brought my two brothers and I</i>
<i>along with him.</i>

42:27.253 --> 42:29.630
<i>So there I was, next to Disneyland</i>

42:29.797 --> 42:34.218
in this hotel room in Anaheim,
and I picked up a phone book,

42:34.301 --> 42:36.637
and just as a curiosity, I looked to see

42:36.720 --> 42:39.557
if there was a listing for ILM,
and there was.

42:40.558 --> 42:44.520
<i>I had been doing a lot of model making as</i>
<i>a hobby at this point, and I called up</i>

42:44.603 --> 42:48.774
and I got Grant McCune on the phone
and I said, "My name is John Knoll.

42:49.233 --> 42:52.194
"I'm interested in working
in the film industry." He said,

42:52.319 --> 42:54.613
"Why don't you come on down
and we'll show you around?"

42:54.697 --> 42:57.408
I didn't tell him I was,
what, 15 years old.

42:57.908 --> 43:01.829
But the next morning,
my dad drove me from Anaheim

43:01.996 --> 43:05.374
<i>up to Van Nuys,</i>
<i>dropped me off at the ILM facility.</i>

43:05.457 --> 43:07.626
<i>It was probably 9:00 in the morning.</i>

43:07.835 --> 43:10.671
So I spent a day, a whole day at ILM.

43:10.754 --> 43:15.009
Lorne Peterson was my host.
So he toured me around.

43:15.384 --> 43:17.720
Grant comes to me and he says,

43:17.803 --> 43:20.264
"There's a boy in the front
that needs a tour."

43:20.389 --> 43:24.518
I go up and I got him, and it was this
13-year-old kid, 14-year-old kid.

43:25.311 --> 43:27.688
<i>And so, you know, I ran him</i>
<i>through the model shop.</i>

43:27.771 --> 43:30.899
<i>I ran him through the machine shop.</i>
<i>I ran him through the camera shop.</i>

43:31.984 --> 43:34.069
All the different parts and departments.

43:37.448 --> 43:39.325
JOHN: <i>This really blew my mind.</i>

43:39.450 --> 43:41.660
<i>You know, it is a very</i>
<i>different experience</i>

43:41.744 --> 43:45.414
to read about these things in a magazine
than it is to see them in person.

43:47.333 --> 43:49.293
<i>And when you see them in person,</i>

43:49.501 --> 43:54.214
<i>it's a lot easier to imagine.</i>
<i>You know, "I can do this.</i>

43:55.090 --> 43:56.592
"I can be one of these people."

43:57.468 --> 43:59.261
In fact, I think I found my people.
(CHUCKLES)

44:01.972 --> 44:05.142
<i>So I had this mind-blowing experience</i>
<i>in '78,</i>

44:05.225 --> 44:08.187
<i>and I still had two years of high school</i>
<i>left at that point.</i>

44:08.270 --> 44:11.857
But that immediately got me thinking,
all right, I'm gonna go to film school.

44:13.525 --> 44:17.655
<i>I got into USC, almost immediately</i>
<i>I did visual effects</i>

44:17.738 --> 44:19.782
<i>and special effects on student films.</i>

44:22.242 --> 44:23.911
<i>I was aware that George had gone there,</i>

44:23.994 --> 44:26.914
<i>and that was partly what made me</i>
<i>interested in going there.</i>

44:28.415 --> 44:32.211
My final project at USC, I built a little
four-channel motion control system

44:32.294 --> 44:36.173
<i>out of a used Apple II computer</i>
<i>and an old milling machine controller</i>

44:36.256 --> 44:39.259
that you could talk to a serial port
and a bunch of stepper motors

44:39.343 --> 44:42.763
and other mechanical gak
that I bought at C&H sales in Pasadena.

44:43.430 --> 44:45.641
<i>And I put all this stuff together</i>
<i>and I bolted it onto</i>

44:45.724 --> 44:50.229
<i>one of the animation stands</i>
<i>and I shot a slit scan film.</i>

44:52.231 --> 44:54.983
<i>It was all kind of under computer control.</i>

44:55.401 --> 45:01.657
About a year after I graduated, I got
a call from one of my instructors at SC

45:01.740 --> 45:02.825
who said ILM had called,

45:02.908 --> 45:06.245
"We're looking for motion control
camera assistants," wanted to know

45:06.328 --> 45:09.039
has anybody graduated recently
who'd be a good candidate.

45:09.123 --> 45:11.458
And he said, "So I recommended you."

45:13.210 --> 45:18.006
ROSE: <i>I was sent to LA frequently</i>
<i>to look for the next generation of talent.</i>

45:18.090 --> 45:20.759
And one of my trips down was to USC,

45:20.843 --> 45:22.970
where I was to interview
all these students,

45:23.053 --> 45:27.182
to find any potential interns for us
at Industrial Light & Magic.

45:27.266 --> 45:32.813
And so I show up and one kid
after another, "I want to be a director."

45:32.896 --> 45:34.773
Ugh, "You're out of here."

45:35.190 --> 45:40.112
(LAUGHING) So, John Knoll walks in
and starts talking about

45:40.195 --> 45:45.284
the motion control camera and rig
that he has built in his apartment,

45:45.492 --> 45:47.703
and he invites me
to his apartment to see it.

45:47.953 --> 45:51.123
And he's just this adorable child,
but very serious.

45:51.206 --> 45:54.084
And I said, "Well, I'm not
going to your apartment,

45:54.168 --> 45:56.795
"but I do think that we should hire you."

45:58.672 --> 46:01.049
JOHN: <i>So I moved up</i>
<i>to Northern California,</i>

46:01.383 --> 46:04.178
<i>and I remember the first time</i>
<i>I set foot in the building,</i>

46:04.428 --> 46:06.638
I was just vibrating with excitement.

46:10.476 --> 46:11.477
<i>This was ILM.</i>

46:11.685 --> 46:15.397
<i>This was where the magic was happening,</i>
<i>quite literally.</i>

46:16.523 --> 46:20.027
My whole life, I've had hobbies,
little things that I work on, on the side,

46:20.110 --> 46:22.321
just to keep me creatively sane.

46:23.238 --> 46:26.200
<i>And I'd been reading about</i>
<i>computer graphics with great interest.</i>

46:26.283 --> 46:29.787
<i>ILM did computer graphics, so it was</i>
<i>something I could go see in person.</i>

46:30.579 --> 46:33.499
<i>I went over and got a tour</i>
<i>of the computer graphics department,</i>

46:33.624 --> 46:36.668
<i>which had just started up,</i>
<i>and I was given a demo</i>

46:36.752 --> 46:38.378
of the Pixar Image Computer.

46:38.504 --> 46:43.008
This is a picture system right here.
And this is a Pixar.

46:43.842 --> 46:48.889
And they had scanned a piece of film
into the Pixar Image Computer...

46:50.933 --> 46:52.851
<i>and they sharpened it.</i>

46:54.853 --> 46:58.190
And I was a little shocked by that.

46:58.524 --> 47:02.110
It wasn't that they had
sharpened a digital image,

47:02.194 --> 47:05.531
that's not super impressive.
It was more what that implied.

47:06.532 --> 47:08.992
<i>Now you could take a piece of film</i>

47:09.618 --> 47:12.079
<i>and you could turn it</i>
<i>into pixels on a computer.</i>

47:13.247 --> 47:16.333
<i>And you could take those images,</i>
<i>and you can manipulate them.</i>

47:19.211 --> 47:21.839
<i>And you could put that back out</i>
<i>onto a piece of film.</i>

47:22.506 --> 47:24.842
And this meant that there was literally

47:24.925 --> 47:26.969
no limit to what you could do
in the middle.

47:27.052 --> 47:29.847
And when I saw that,
I felt like I had seen the future.

47:31.807 --> 47:35.227
I actually couldn't believe
that nobody else was just jumping up

47:35.310 --> 47:38.814
and down about this, like, "No, no,
this is going to change the world."

47:40.190 --> 47:43.235
I knew digital technology
was going to be ultimately

47:43.318 --> 47:45.070
the most important thing in movies.

47:45.529 --> 47:48.031
The old way of doing things
was going to be gone.

47:48.198 --> 47:50.242
Well, let's take a look at reel 12 here.

47:51.785 --> 47:53.871
Well, this first shot, so probably you'll

47:53.996 --> 47:56.832
have to find the Ben Kenobi tractor beam
tone backwards.

47:56.915 --> 47:58.041
Probably go in there.

47:59.167 --> 48:01.461
BEN: <i>When George first told me</i>
<i>about the fact</i>

48:01.545 --> 48:04.172
<i>that he wanted to change the way</i>
<i>movies were made,</i>

48:04.256 --> 48:05.883
I didn't quite understand that.

48:06.341 --> 48:09.177
Because I thought,
"Wow, we're making a movie

48:09.344 --> 48:13.056
"and we just made a <i>Star Wars</i> movie
and it's a big success.

48:13.140 --> 48:14.850
"I mean, what else do you want?"

48:15.017 --> 48:16.351
I was naive, I think.

48:17.394 --> 48:20.564
<i>I first met George in 1975.</i>

48:20.647 --> 48:25.611
When the opportunity came to work
on the first <i>Star Wars</i> movie,

48:26.361 --> 48:28.322
<i>George and Gary Kurtz</i>

48:28.614 --> 48:32.117
<i>were looking for some student</i>
<i>interested in sound to hire</i>

48:32.200 --> 48:34.411
<i>to record sounds for the film.</i>

48:34.494 --> 48:37.122
(SEALS BARKING)

48:37.497 --> 48:40.167
<i>They had one specific assignment</i>
<i>at that moment.</i>

48:40.334 --> 48:43.795
They wanted to develop the voice
for a character named Chewbacca.

48:44.004 --> 48:46.548
(GROWLING)

48:48.091 --> 48:50.010
(APPLAUDING)

48:50.385 --> 48:53.847
And I went through the script
to see what part Chewbacca played,

48:53.931 --> 48:55.849
and I realized as I'm reading the script,

48:55.933 --> 48:58.393
that there were all sorts
of sounds in this movie.

48:58.936 --> 49:03.440
<i>Robots and Jawas</i>
<i>the Death Star, laser weapons.</i>

49:04.399 --> 49:06.568
<i>And so I went back to them and said,</i>

49:06.652 --> 49:10.030
<i>"Well, you've got a lot of things</i>
<i>in this movie that need sound.</i>

49:11.156 --> 49:13.116
"Do you want me to work on
all of this, too?"

49:13.200 --> 49:17.204
And they said, "Yeah, yeah, you might as
well, go ahead, just work on everything."

49:17.287 --> 49:20.374
(DARTH VADER BREATHING)

49:21.458 --> 49:25.879
Over the years, George gave me chances
to do different things.

49:26.755 --> 49:27.881
<i>I could work in sound.</i>

49:27.965 --> 49:30.550

49:32.803 --> 49:36.056
<i>I did some writing.</i>
<i>I worked as a second unit director.</i>

49:36.598 --> 49:38.642
<i>I was a film editor.</i>

49:38.725 --> 49:43.647
<i>And as I got more experience,</i>
<i>I began to see, you know, George is right.</i>

49:44.147 --> 49:45.774
We need a better way to do this.

49:47.609 --> 49:50.988
You know, that whole transition
into digital was huge.

49:52.781 --> 49:55.867
<i>We started it really right</i>
<i>after</i> Return of the Jedi,

49:55.951 --> 50:01.957
and we spent over ten years and lots
of money to develop digital technology.

50:03.709 --> 50:06.461
<i>Nobody knew</i>
<i>what digital could do or couldn't do.</i>

50:07.337 --> 50:09.589
FRANK: <i>I think George is a dreamer,</i>

50:10.007 --> 50:13.343
and I think he dreams big
and he doesn't take no for an answer.

50:14.553 --> 50:20.767
<i>I remember he created the first computer</i>
<i>editing system, the EditDroid.</i>

50:22.060 --> 50:23.603
BEN: <i>George invested right away</i>

50:23.937 --> 50:27.733
in this new editing device.
And as it developed

50:27.816 --> 50:30.277
in house, I was kind of a test pilot.

50:32.362 --> 50:35.157
I was very tired of going through bins

50:35.240 --> 50:37.617
<i>looking for three frames</i>
<i>that had been cut off.</i>

50:37.701 --> 50:40.037
<i>Asking the assistant</i>
<i>to get me a piece of film.</i>

50:40.203 --> 50:44.166
<i>It made it so you'd take forever to cut</i>
<i>a film, and I was too impatient for that.</i>

50:44.416 --> 50:47.836
So we started building
these digital editing systems.

50:48.587 --> 50:51.423
BEN: <i>I was there running tests</i>
<i>and it fascinated me.</i>

50:52.591 --> 50:55.093
Also, I needed a place
to cut my home movies.

50:57.137 --> 51:01.266
I remember these rooms of machines
all lined up and he was going to do this

51:01.349 --> 51:07.564
demonstration for linear editing
or nonlinear editing, whichever that is.

51:08.106 --> 51:12.486
GEORGE: <i>There was no equipment, so we had</i>
<i>to build a system around the equipment</i>

51:12.694 --> 51:13.862
but it was all digital.

51:14.321 --> 51:18.533
Now we can access video randomly
because we had a disk instead of a tape.

51:18.617 --> 51:20.827
FRANK: <i>And he pressed the button</i>

51:22.871 --> 51:25.916
and nothing worked
and they had a meltdown.

51:26.249 --> 51:29.294
<i>But he kept pushing and he kept doing it,</i>
<i>and he kept doing it.</i>

51:29.377 --> 51:30.962
He knew it was right.

George knew this was gonna happen
and that technology would take us to that.

52:04.204 --> 52:06.081
And it's what happened with CGI, too.

52:06.498 --> 52:08.959
We'd reached the point
where we could do something

52:09.459 --> 52:11.586

52:11.670 --> 52:13.797
<i>Where we could do image compositing,</i>

53:18.445 --> 53:21.239
was a vision algorithm,
sort of how computers can

53:21.364 --> 53:23.575
recognize objects in a digital picture.

53:23.909 --> 53:26.036
<i>And my first thought was,</i>
<i>"That looks a lot like</i>

53:26.119 --> 53:29.289
<i>"what I just saw in the ILM</i>
<i>computer graphics department."</i>

53:30.040 --> 53:33.835
<i>But the Pixar Image Computer</i>
<i>was this $120,000 piece of hardware</i>

53:33.919 --> 53:36.630
<i>that no hobbyist</i>
<i>was ever going to get to play with.</i>

53:36.838 --> 53:40.091
But Thomas had written all the stuff
that ran on a Macintosh.

53:41.509 --> 53:43.553
<i>I remember haranguing him about,</i>

53:43.637 --> 53:46.640
"Hey, how hard would it be
to take the core of this,

53:46.848 --> 53:48.934
"the main image processing tools

53:49.017 --> 53:51.978
"and bundle those into an application,
a standalone application

53:52.103 --> 53:55.482
"that does that,
that loads and displays images?"

53:55.565 --> 53:58.485
He went, "I don't know.
It's maybe a day or so."

53:58.944 --> 54:01.321
<i>And so, one weekend</i>
<i>he wrote a little application.</i>

54:01.446 --> 54:03.740
<i>It was called Display, that just did that.</i>

54:03.823 --> 54:07.285
It would display a raw image,
and I thought, "Oh, this is really cool.

54:07.369 --> 54:08.870
"What if we could do this?"

54:08.954 --> 54:12.165
<i>And I started egging him on</i>
<i>to add this and that feature to it.</i>

54:14.793 --> 54:19.631
I felt like, you know, there's something
here that I think could be commercial.

54:24.219 --> 54:26.805
(CHUCKLING) And his first reaction was,
"Oh, you're nuts.

54:26.930 --> 54:29.015
"Do you have any idea how much work

54:29.099 --> 54:31.184
"writing a commercial application
really is?"

54:31.268 --> 54:33.979
<i>And, you know, happily, I did not.</i>

54:35.730 --> 54:38.316
And one thing led to another until

54:39.693 --> 54:41.027
<i>it turned into Photoshop.</i>

54:46.032 --> 54:49.286
I didn't know John from anybody else
when he started here, of course,

54:49.369 --> 54:52.831
but he was always really curious
and we struck up a little relationship,

54:52.914 --> 54:55.208
and over the years he got
more and more interested.

54:55.292 --> 54:58.003
And was kind of pushing
the computer stuff that he was doing.

54:58.128 --> 55:01.715
Well, he gave me a little early version
of Photoshop before it had a name.

55:02.132 --> 55:05.427
<i>So he was a bridge</i>
<i>and a really important one</i>

55:05.510 --> 55:09.180
<i>between sort of the old school,</i>
<i>which he knew, and the idea</i>

55:09.264 --> 55:12.600
<i>of what you could do with new tools</i>
<i>that had not been invented yet.</i>

55:13.476 --> 55:15.103
Change is always very difficult.

55:15.770 --> 55:18.064
<i>And in the beginning,</i>
<i>there was a little bit</i>

55:18.148 --> 55:20.692
<i>of hostility between ILM</i>
<i>and the computer division.</i>

55:21.860 --> 55:24.112
<i>Nobody would go over to the other campus.</i>

55:25.155 --> 55:30.327
And finally I got Dennis a computer
and he started learning about computers.

55:30.452 --> 55:32.287
<i>And then he went over and started talking</i>

55:32.370 --> 55:34.372
<i>to the computer people</i>
<i>and working with them.</i>

55:35.123 --> 55:38.918
And so he was my inroad into ILM
from the computer division.

55:42.005 --> 55:45.133
DENNIS: <i>I felt we really had hit</i>
<i>limitations with traditional effects.</i>

55:45.842 --> 55:49.262
<i>They were all kind of looking the same</i>
<i>in the mid-1980s.</i>

55:49.346 --> 55:51.848
<i>We couldn't fiddle around</i>
<i>with a toolbox much more.</i>

55:51.931 --> 55:53.808
So I was always looking
for something else.

56:01.191 --> 56:06.071
<i>Computer graphics had been floating around</i>
<i>as an idea since the '70s and all,</i>

56:06.154 --> 56:08.365
<i>and we kind of see it kind of looks fake.</i>

56:10.658 --> 56:14.662
So as we set up the graphics department,
I would stick my nose in there

56:14.746 --> 56:17.749
every so often and and see if this was
actually gonna be something

56:17.832 --> 56:21.252
<i>that was gonna deliver, 'cause George</i>
<i>put a lot of money into this.</i>

56:21.336 --> 56:23.838
<i>So this was the promise,</i>
<i>that we're going to be able</i>

56:23.922 --> 56:25.965
<i>to do something with computer graphics.</i>

56:26.132 --> 56:29.552
But it was a lot of time,
software and building this and that,

56:29.636 --> 56:32.055
and, you know,
occasional dog and pony shows,

56:32.138 --> 56:35.016
and then two years later,
you couldn't see the difference.

56:35.475 --> 56:37.894
ED: <i>Dennis is this completely</i>
<i>wide open person.</i>

56:37.977 --> 56:40.438
He listened. He liked new ideas.

56:41.356 --> 56:44.317
<i>But at that time, the computer division,</i>

56:45.068 --> 56:47.987
<i>we were actually trying to make</i>
<i>these animated short films.</i>

56:49.948 --> 56:55.203
So, what we were doing was not relevant
to what they were doing in their minds.

56:55.787 --> 56:59.374
<i>In fact, I met with George</i>
<i>and I told George that ultimately</i>

56:59.457 --> 57:01.501
<i>what we wanted to do was animated films.</i>

57:01.793 --> 57:08.049
Ed Catmull was hell-bent to make cartoons,
and so he hired John Lasseter to come in,

57:08.133 --> 57:11.302
<i>put him in a closet and they were</i>
<i>making these little cartoons</i>

57:11.469 --> 57:13.054
<i>to prove that they could do it.</i>

57:14.139 --> 57:19.436
In the six years that I was at Lucasfilm,
every one of the projects

57:19.519 --> 57:23.690
that were started, we got started on
the technological path they need to be on.

57:25.400 --> 57:29.487
But it was clear that the goals
weren't entirely lined up.

57:31.406 --> 57:35.076
And so the decision was made to sell us.

57:36.953 --> 57:41.833
Once I felt I had all the tools I needed,
then I sold Pixar.

57:42.876 --> 57:46.421
<i>I knew they wanted to be</i>
<i>a cartoon company.</i>

57:49.382 --> 57:53.011
So I said, "Well, let's see if we can
find somebody who's crazy enough."

57:58.057 --> 58:00.143
<i>I ended up selling it to Steve Jobs.</i>

58:01.603 --> 58:03.897
<i>Because I knew he would</i>
<i>actually follow through</i>

58:03.980 --> 58:07.317
and convert it over into a movie company.

58:07.442 --> 58:12.447
(SQUEAKING)

58:12.530 --> 58:14.824
<i>They wanted to keep that name,</i>
<i>so I let them have it.</i>

58:23.875 --> 58:26.836
ROSE: <i>George sold that whole division</i>
<i>to Steve Jobs.</i>

58:27.712 --> 58:31.007
I was sorry to see them go,
but immediately ILM just rebuilt.

58:31.925 --> 58:36.596
<i>George brought in workhorses</i>
<i>to actually do what we needed to do,</i>

58:36.763 --> 58:38.723
<i>which was support visual effects.</i>

58:39.516 --> 58:41.351
And, boy, did they.

58:42.143 --> 58:45.813
DENNIS: <i>So now ILM could make their own</i>
<i>computer graphics department.</i>

58:47.315 --> 58:52.195
<i>And once we had control of the map,</i>
<i>is when I think we really</i>

58:52.904 --> 58:55.615
could then focus on making movie effects.

58:58.201 --> 58:59.911
JAMES CAMERON: <i>I talked to Dennis Muren.</i>

58:59.994 --> 59:03.456
And he said,
"We might be able to show you something."

59:04.832 --> 59:07.627
<i>I thought, one, total leap of faith.</i>

59:07.710 --> 59:10.505
<i>Two, it was ludicrously ambitious.</i>

59:11.297 --> 59:14.634
But it will be so cool.

59:16.010 --> 59:17.178
Bud...
