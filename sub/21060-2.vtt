-(screaming)
-* Bad boys *

00:11.133 --> 00:12.933
-* Whatcha want,
whatcha want *

00:12.967 --> 00:15.033
* Whatcha gonna do *

00:15.067 --> 00:18.900
-* When the Sheriff John Brown
come for you? *
-Stop! Now! Stop!

00:18.933 --> 00:21.000
-(clattering)
-Heads up!

00:21.033 --> 00:23.500
-* Bad boys, bad boys,
watcha gonna do... *

00:23.533 --> 00:25.933
I smoked some marijuana!
I'm a marijuana smoker!

00:25.967 --> 00:27.800
-* Bad boys, bad boys *
-Crawl out!

00:27.833 --> 00:29.200
* Whatcha gonna do... *

00:29.233 --> 00:30.433
-Hands up! Hands up!

00:30.467 --> 00:32.333
Hold it! Hold it!
Hold it! Hold it!

00:32.367 --> 00:34.400
-Announcer:
"Cops" is filmed on location

00:34.433 --> 00:36.500
with the men and women
of law enforcement.

00:36.533 --> 00:39.067
All suspects are innocent
until proven guilty

00:39.100 --> 00:42.400
in a court of law.

00:42.433 --> 00:45.400
-Part of the things
that we work on here
in law enforcement is narcotics.

00:45.433 --> 00:47.800
We see that in almost
every facet of what we do.

00:47.833 --> 00:50.567
There's drugs and burglaries,
drugs and home invasion,

00:50.600 --> 00:53.200
drugs involved in just about
every crime that occurs here.

00:53.233 --> 00:55.067
One of the things we
constantly are trying to do

00:55.100 --> 00:56.767
is help children stay off drugs.

00:56.800 --> 00:59.233
And that's what we work hard
towards is teaching these youths

00:59.267 --> 01:03.067
that the drugs will actually
make them do things
that they wouldn't normally do,

01:03.067 --> 01:05.500
and it ultimately
will cost them their freedoms.

01:05.533 --> 01:06.967
It looks like there's
a quad down here.

01:07.067 --> 01:09.500
We're gonna turn around down
here and see what it's up to.

01:09.533 --> 01:11.500
-(engine revs)
-Looks like he's trying
to get away from us.

01:11.533 --> 01:14.067
-Ops One.
-(over radio): Ops One.

01:14.100 --> 01:16.200
-Got a four-wheeler here,
duckin' out on us,

01:16.233 --> 01:18.533
headed out
into the desert, westbound.

01:18.567 --> 01:21.733
-(siren blaring)
-In pursuit.

01:21.767 --> 01:24.633
Comstock from Bourbon.

01:24.667 --> 01:28.767
So we're in pursuit of a quad,
took off on us, uh, back there.

01:28.800 --> 01:31.200
-(siren blaring)

01:31.233 --> 01:33.433
-(over radio): Ops One, copy.

01:33.467 --> 01:36.300
(quad revving)

01:36.333 --> 01:40.067
-Southbound from Comstock,
south on Blagg.

01:40.100 --> 01:44.500
-(over radio): Southbound
from Comstock, south on Blagg.

01:44.533 --> 01:47.533
-(siren blaring)

01:50.533 --> 01:53.533
(quad revving)

01:53.567 --> 01:57.733
-Comstock Circle.
Looks like he wrecked
off Comstock.

02:00.200 --> 02:02.900
-(over radio): Stop.
Comstock Circle South.

02:02.933 --> 02:05.500
-Let me see your hands!
Put your hands up now!

02:05.533 --> 02:08.333
Put your hands in the air!

02:08.367 --> 02:09.967
Both of them in the air!

02:10.067 --> 02:13.333
Ops One, one at gunpoint,
not cooperative.

02:13.367 --> 02:15.133
Put your hands in the air,
both of them!

02:15.167 --> 02:16.367
Keep 'em over your head!

02:16.400 --> 02:18.267
Your hands over your head now!

02:18.300 --> 02:20.167
Not cooperative.

02:20.200 --> 02:22.533
Put your hands over your head!

02:22.567 --> 02:24.300
Keep them over your head!

02:24.333 --> 02:26.800
-(over radio): Where is he at?
-Don't move!

02:26.833 --> 02:29.867
-(over radio): South 14,
he's on Comstock Circle.

02:33.633 --> 02:34.867
-Keep 'em up!

02:34.900 --> 02:37.233
Put 'em over your head now!

02:37.267 --> 02:38.967
-(grumbles)
-Keep them over your head!

02:39.067 --> 02:42.267
-My ribs are broke.
-I don't care, put 'em
on the back of your head now!

02:42.300 --> 02:44.433
Leave 'em on the back
of your head!

02:44.467 --> 02:46.767
-What's that?
-My legs are broke.

02:46.800 --> 02:48.533
-Put 'em on your head!

02:48.567 --> 02:50.267
-My legs are broke.
-Keep your hands up!

02:50.300 --> 02:54.467
-My legs are broke.
-I will get you an ambulance.
Keep your hands up!

02:54.500 --> 02:56.900
Put 'em on the back
of your head!

02:56.933 --> 02:58.333
-I'm trying to,
my leg is broke.

02:58.367 --> 03:00.067
-I will get you
an ambulance.

03:00.100 --> 03:02.100
-(groans)
Both my legs are broke.

03:02.133 --> 03:04.467
(groaning)

03:05.833 --> 03:07.133
-(groaning)
-Stop!

03:07.167 --> 03:08.633
-(over radio):
Ops One, status?

03:08.667 --> 03:11.367
-I'm not doin' nothin'.
-Put your hands
behind your back!

03:11.400 --> 03:13.933
-You're a (bleep).
-I am?

03:13.967 --> 03:15.500
-My-- My-- My leg is broke.

03:15.533 --> 03:17.467
-Well, I'm gonna
get you an ambulance.

03:17.500 --> 03:20.400
Code four, one in custody.
Send me an ambulance.

03:20.433 --> 03:22.533
-(groans)
Oh my God, it's broke.

03:22.567 --> 03:24.533
-(over radio): Ops One,
what's your exact location?

03:24.567 --> 03:28.500
-(groans)
-In the desert, off of Blagg
and Comstock.

03:28.533 --> 03:31.200
Juan, how many years
has this been goin' on with you?

03:31.233 --> 03:33.267
I thought you'd learned better.

03:33.300 --> 03:36.433
-My leg is broke.
-I know, I've got an
ambulance comin' from ya.

03:36.467 --> 03:40.067
-Yeah, but you
didn't care about me--
-Do you have dope on you?

03:40.067 --> 03:43.067
-No, I don't.
-How many times do we have
to go through this with you?

03:43.100 --> 03:44.767
Why are you runnin'?

03:44.800 --> 03:47.733
-I'm not runnin' from nothin'.
-Why didn't you stop for me?

03:47.767 --> 03:51.433
-For-- What?
-Why didn't you stop for me?

03:51.467 --> 03:54.133
-When did I have
to stop for you?

03:54.167 --> 03:56.833
-When I'm behind you
with my lights and sirens on.

03:56.867 --> 03:58.967
-Your lights and sirens...

03:59.067 --> 04:02.467
-What?
-(groans) My leg is broke.

04:02.500 --> 04:04.100
-I've got an ambulance
comin' for ya.

04:04.133 --> 04:06.400
-(groaning)

04:06.433 --> 04:09.067
-You have been doing this
for far too many years with us.

04:09.067 --> 04:10.667
-(groans)
-All right?

04:10.700 --> 04:13.333
Far too many.
You're just gonna hang out
until the ambulance gets here.

04:13.367 --> 04:15.767
Okay?
-Okay, can you get
the backpack off of me?

04:15.800 --> 04:17.633
No, not right now.
-You know you can.

04:17.667 --> 04:19.267
-I can't, it's
behind your handcuffs.

04:19.300 --> 04:22.333
-Come on, man,
like, where the hell
am I gonna run to?

04:22.367 --> 04:24.067
-You just demonstrated
where you're gonna run to.

04:24.067 --> 04:26.367
Absolutely anywhere you can
other than with us.

04:26.400 --> 04:28.133
And, man, that's the least
of your worries right now.

04:28.167 --> 04:31.200
-I ain't got no worries.
I will be bailed out
by the morning.

04:31.233 --> 04:33.667
You can bail out,
you're not even in jail yet.

04:33.700 --> 04:37.467
Ready? (indistinct)
One, two, three.

04:37.500 --> 04:38.800
Good.

04:40.500 --> 04:44.367
(panting)
Why don't you... run that?

04:44.400 --> 04:47.533
And see if it's, uh, stolen.

04:47.567 --> 04:48.633
Where'd you get the quad?

04:48.667 --> 04:50.433
-I've had that quad
for five years.

04:50.467 --> 04:51.500
-It's yours?
-Yeah, it's mine.

04:51.533 --> 04:54.367
-(horn honks)
-Hey, medics are here, man.

04:54.400 --> 04:56.100
We'll get her in
and get you right, all right?

04:56.133 --> 04:57.633
-Watch him for a sec, Auggie.

05:00.700 --> 05:02.967
-I think he's got
a broken leg.
I haven't moved him.

05:03.067 --> 05:04.400
He's asking me
to relieve the pressure.

05:04.433 --> 05:06.400
-What'd he do,
run from you?
-Yeah.

05:06.433 --> 05:08.333
He wrecked, just tumbled
this way, and he's complaining

05:08.367 --> 05:10.133
of extreme pressure and pain.

05:10.167 --> 05:12.967
-All right, we'll take look.
We're gonna have to
get you outta here, though.

05:13.067 --> 05:16.967
-Roll up and sit on your butt.
-(groaning)

05:17.067 --> 05:18.967
-We're gonna try
to stand you up, all right?

05:19.067 --> 05:20.967
-I cannot stand up.
-No?

05:21.067 --> 05:22.400
-You're gonna have to stand,
sir, okay?

05:22.433 --> 05:24.233
There's no way
to get you out of here.

05:24.267 --> 05:27.067
-He said it's his left leg
that has the injury.

05:27.100 --> 05:28.567
-My left--
-All right.

05:28.600 --> 05:32.400
-(groaning) Ow!
Hey! What the--

05:32.433 --> 05:34.533
-We're pressin' on it.
We gotta make sure
where it's at.

05:34.567 --> 05:36.733
-(groaning)
-We gotta make sure
nothing's pokin' out, all right?

05:36.767 --> 05:38.900
-Oh, oh my God.
-Stand up!

05:38.933 --> 05:41.333
-Ow! Come on! (groans)
-Ready?

05:41.367 --> 05:43.600
All right.
-Uh, we're pretty familiar
with him.

05:43.633 --> 05:46.733
He's regularly, uh,
causing problems
for the community.

05:46.767 --> 05:49.100
He never wants
to get caught by the police,
and so he always runs.

05:49.133 --> 05:52.067
Obviously, the four-wheeler
is the preferred method
to get away from us,

05:52.100 --> 05:54.533
'cause they can get
into the dirt.

05:54.567 --> 05:57.800
-(groaning)
-Start gettin' aggressive,
give us a hard time,

05:57.833 --> 05:59.500
and we'll keep you
out of the ambulance.

05:59.533 --> 06:02.600
-I've got my shoes on.
-Okay. Well, just be cool
and we'll be cool,

06:02.633 --> 06:03.800
that's all that counts.

06:03.833 --> 06:06.067
-Move the other foot, please.
Move the other foot.

06:06.100 --> 06:08.133
-That's what's... (groans)

06:08.167 --> 06:10.233
-There you go.
-So there was one point
back there,

06:10.267 --> 06:12.633
I cut the corner after him
into the desert.

06:12.667 --> 06:15.700
It looks like, uh,
I probably hit the, uh,
bottom of the radiator.

06:15.733 --> 06:17.500
It looks like I'm leakin'
some radiator fluid,

06:17.533 --> 06:21.067
so we'll limp it
back to the garage
and let the mechanics

06:21.067 --> 06:23.067
take a look at it
first thing in the morning.

06:23.067 --> 06:25.733
I'm pretty sure
it was his intention
to come in through here

06:25.767 --> 06:27.900
and losing me
through this terrain,

06:27.933 --> 06:30.467
but he was goin'
a little too fast.

06:30.500 --> 06:33.167
Um...
-He's obviously in custody?

06:33.200 --> 06:34.467
-Yes.
He's in custody.

06:34.500 --> 06:36.433
-All right.
-So you'll follow him
to the hospital.

06:36.467 --> 06:37.733
I'll have Max do a draw
on him.

06:37.767 --> 06:40.067
And then I'll go
limp my car
back to the garage.

06:40.100 --> 06:41.933
-All right.

06:41.967 --> 06:44.400
So, the four-wheelers
are constantly used
for running drugs

06:44.433 --> 06:46.700
in and out
of this community
because it makes it difficult

06:46.733 --> 06:48.667
for us to find
and capture them.

06:48.700 --> 06:50.967
Often, when we apprehend them,
they have narcotics.

06:51.067 --> 06:52.367
That's why they're running.

06:52.400 --> 06:54.600
Uh, and they're usin'
the four-wheelers
as an easy means

06:54.633 --> 06:56.967
of getting away from us,
because they can
get through terrain

06:57.067 --> 06:58.200
that our vehicles can't.

06:58.233 --> 07:00.667
Pretty normal for them
to try that, and at the end,

07:00.700 --> 07:02.600
this didn't work out
for him so well.

07:04.967 --> 07:06.733
-So I was born and raised
here in Fort Myers.

07:06.767 --> 07:08.567
Been here 28 years.

07:08.600 --> 07:11.533
The only time I left
was when I joined
the Marine Corps.

07:11.567 --> 07:15.200
During that time,
I developed the interest
to join the Sheriff's Office.

07:15.233 --> 07:18.867
Always wanted to have a job
that, I looked forward

07:18.900 --> 07:21.067
to going to every single day.

07:21.067 --> 07:23.067
All right, we're just
going over to Zelda Park

07:23.067 --> 07:24.967
real quick, do an area check.

07:25.067 --> 07:28.100
It's known to have people there
smokin' dope, so we'll see
what's goin' on.

07:29.400 --> 07:31.400
There's just two individuals
sitting in their car, so--

07:32.400 --> 07:33.900
Hello, how are you doin'?

07:33.933 --> 07:36.233
This is a county park,
it's closed after dark.

07:36.267 --> 07:37.700
Do you have ID on you?

07:37.733 --> 07:38.933
-Oh my God.

07:38.967 --> 07:40.967
-(radio chatter)

07:41.067 --> 07:44.800
-We're at Zelda Park
with a white vehicle.
Stand by for the tag.

07:44.833 --> 07:46.267
It's occupied times two.

07:50.067 --> 07:53.467
Thanks, ma'am.
Nothin' illegal in the car?
No drugs? No guns?

07:53.500 --> 07:55.833
Can I look when I'm done
with the, uh,
the stop here?

07:55.867 --> 07:57.200
-Yeah.
-Okay.

07:57.233 --> 07:59.467
Hey, Candace, you wanna
pull 'em out?

07:59.500 --> 08:00.867
You guys live out here
in Lehigh?

08:00.900 --> 08:02.300
-Yes.
-Oh, okay.

08:02.333 --> 08:04.067
Are you guys dating?
-No.

08:04.100 --> 08:05.367
-Hey, ma'am,
you can hop out now.

08:05.400 --> 08:07.267
-Okay.
-Appreciate it.
You don't have anything

08:07.300 --> 08:09.067
on you, right?
No guns, nothin' like that?

08:09.067 --> 08:10.967
-No, I don't have anything.
-Just your name tag, right?

08:11.067 --> 08:14.267
-Yeah, my name tag.
-Okay. Come on over here.

08:14.300 --> 08:16.800
Just stand back here,
I'm gonna have her
just pat you down for weapons,

08:16.833 --> 08:19.267
and then we'll--
You guys'll just hang out here.

08:19.300 --> 08:20.300
-Okay.

08:21.833 --> 08:23.433
She left her purse in here.

08:23.467 --> 08:25.633
I'm free to look through it.

08:27.467 --> 08:31.200
Um, when they consent
to search, that includes
everything inside the car.

08:31.233 --> 08:34.067
I smelled the odor
of marijuana, like that.

08:34.100 --> 08:36.700
So right now, all I have
is this little marijuana roach.

08:36.733 --> 08:39.367
Uh, if it's just that
we'll probably document
that they had drug

08:39.400 --> 08:42.500
paraphernalia and then,
um, let them go.

08:42.533 --> 08:44.867
They-- Neither of them
have any records
as of right now,

08:44.900 --> 08:47.433
and it gives them
a positive outlook
on law enforcement.

08:47.467 --> 08:50.800
Um, we'll see
if there's anything else.

08:50.833 --> 08:52.667
I'm over here
on the passenger side now.

08:52.700 --> 08:54.400
I'm gonna start
with this backpack.

08:54.433 --> 08:57.400
We'll look through the bag,
make sure there's nothin'
illegal in the bag.

08:59.067 --> 09:03.600
Okay. Um, there's a handgun.

09:03.633 --> 09:08.800
Got a Ruger handgun
here, LCP. It's probably gonna
be a .22 or a 9 mil.

09:10.133 --> 09:12.600
So we're gonna run it
and make sure it's not stolen,

09:12.633 --> 09:14.067
and then we'll go from there.

09:14.100 --> 09:18.067
So, we'll see here
in just a minute, make sure
it's clear.

09:22.567 --> 09:25.333
And it is.
Nothin' in the chamber.

09:25.367 --> 09:27.533
Let's go talk to 'em
and find out what's goin' on.

09:27.567 --> 09:29.833
Hey, Sofia?
You guys have been
very cooperative with me

09:29.867 --> 09:31.567
and I appreciate that.

09:31.600 --> 09:33.967
I know you're in handcuffs,
but you're not in the back
of the patrol car yet.

09:34.067 --> 09:35.800
You're not under arrest--
-Yet?

09:35.833 --> 09:38.700
-Yeah. Well, I got
some questions about
what's goin' on in the car.

09:38.733 --> 09:40.767
Okay?
Do you understand?

09:40.800 --> 09:42.867
I come to a park
that's closed after dark, okay?

09:42.900 --> 09:45.400
-Yes.
-I found marijuana
in your purse.

09:45.433 --> 09:46.767
In your clutch
in the car.

09:46.800 --> 09:48.633
And I found a gun
in his bag.

09:48.667 --> 09:50.133
In the car.

09:50.167 --> 09:51.867
Did you know
both of those items
were there?

09:51.900 --> 09:53.733
-No.
-You didn't know
that you had weed

09:53.767 --> 09:55.467
in your clutch?
-I did know that.

09:55.500 --> 09:58.267
-You did know that?
Okay, did you know
he had a gun in his bag?

09:58.300 --> 09:59.800
-No, did not know that.

09:59.833 --> 10:01.200
-Do you know
that he carries a gun?

10:01.233 --> 10:03.733
-No. I just met him
like a month ago.

10:03.767 --> 10:05.233
-You just met-- How do you
know him?

10:05.267 --> 10:06.367
-He goes to my school.

10:06.400 --> 10:08.333
-Are you guys dating?
-No.

10:08.367 --> 10:12.600
-You guys talking?
-Oh, we're just
communicating with each other.

10:12.633 --> 10:16.867
But, we don't have anything--
I just met him, like,
a month ago.

10:16.900 --> 10:19.067
But we're not really
doing anything.

10:19.100 --> 10:22.133
-Okay. Does he sell you--
Does he sell you weed?
-No.

10:22.167 --> 10:24.267
-He doesn't sell weed?
-No. No.

10:24.300 --> 10:26.467
I just wanna know
what's gonna happen
with my parents,

10:26.500 --> 10:29.000
because I wanna get home,
I don't want my parents
to find out about this.

10:29.033 --> 10:32.333
-Well, as of right now,
you're gonna be charged
with possession of marijuana,

10:32.367 --> 10:35.467
and as of right now,
he's gonna be charged
with possession of a firearm.

10:35.500 --> 10:37.733
-How about me?
What do I do?
-I just told you.

10:37.767 --> 10:40.733
-Yeah, but tell me
what I do. Um, is my parents
gonna find out about this?

10:40.767 --> 10:42.333
-They're gonna know
that you went to jail, yeah,

10:42.367 --> 10:44.100
if I end up arresting you.
-Am I gonna go to jail?

10:44.133 --> 10:47.267
Don't arrest me, please,
I've never even had weed
on me before.

10:47.300 --> 10:48.967
This is the first time ever.

10:49.000 --> 10:51.333
-Sofia, I understand
that you're upset,
so what I'm gonna do

10:51.367 --> 10:53.467
is, I'm gonna let you relax
in the back of this car
for a second.

10:53.500 --> 10:55.300
-But I can't, just tell me
what's gonna happen, please.

10:55.333 --> 10:57.767
Oh, wait.
Where's your car at?
-Please, just please

10:57.800 --> 10:59.367
let me know
what's gonna happen.

10:59.400 --> 11:02.167
I'll pay anything.
-How old are you?

11:02.200 --> 11:05.100
-Seventeen.
I'm literally-- never even
carried weed before me

11:05.133 --> 11:06.700
until today.
-Okay, listen to me.

11:06.733 --> 11:08.867
-I don't wanna
go to jail, please.
-I understand you don't want to.

11:08.900 --> 11:11.433
I don't wanna sit here
and keep havin' this--
this same rhetoric

11:11.467 --> 11:13.533
over and over again, okay?
Let me go talk to Ishmael.

11:13.567 --> 11:16.500
-My parents are gonna
call me, and I--
-Sofia, I'm gonna tell you

11:16.533 --> 11:19.633
one more time,
get in this car, so I can
go talk to Ishmael.

11:19.667 --> 11:21.933
-Can someone just stay with me,
'cause I don't wanna be alone.

11:21.967 --> 11:23.933
-Yeah. I mean,
you're not alone. There's
a lot of people

11:23.967 --> 11:26.133
right here, okay?
-Someone needed
to come with me.

11:26.167 --> 11:28.600
-Just sit here
and relax, okay?
-Please?

11:28.633 --> 11:32.067
-Okay, Ishmael.
You think it's gonna be
a stolen gun?

11:32.067 --> 11:33.467
-I don't know.
-You don't know?

11:33.500 --> 11:35.567
-Everything, I found it
in the bushes.

11:35.600 --> 11:38.400
-It was in the bushes? Okay.

11:38.433 --> 11:40.767
How old are you?
-I just turned eighteen.

11:40.800 --> 11:43.900
-You just turned eighteen.
-I'm an athlete, I run track.

11:43.933 --> 11:45.567
-You're an athlete,
you run track?

11:45.600 --> 11:48.067
You got me
in a tough spot, Ishmael.

11:48.100 --> 11:50.067
What I want is I want
the truth.

11:50.067 --> 11:51.933
You know, I found weed
in her purse too, right?

11:51.967 --> 11:56.067
-You got some weed?
-Just a little joint,
but still.

11:56.067 --> 11:58.500
-She said I sold her weed?
-You don't sell weed?

11:58.533 --> 12:02.233
-No, sir.
-Who do you think
sold her that?

12:02.267 --> 12:04.500
You don't know? Okay.

12:04.533 --> 12:06.367
Okay. All right.

12:06.400 --> 12:08.067
Sit tight for a minute.

12:10.333 --> 12:12.967
-(speaking Spanish)
-Because they are my friends.

12:13.067 --> 12:15.667
-(speaking Spanish)
-(speaking Spanish)

12:15.700 --> 12:18.533
-Hello, how are you doin',
I'm Deputy Roedding
with the Sheriff's Office.

12:18.567 --> 12:22.233
Long story short,
your daughter could be charged
with possession of marijuana,

12:22.267 --> 12:24.633
okay?
'Cause it's-- it was
in her clutch,

12:24.667 --> 12:26.167
she stated that it was hers.

12:26.200 --> 12:27.833
She said it was her weed.

12:27.867 --> 12:31.067
Um, the male said
that it was her weed.

12:31.067 --> 12:35.333
They're-- She didn't know--
She claims to not have knowledge
about the gun, that he knew

12:35.367 --> 12:38.067
that the gun was there.
He said it's his and stuff, so.

12:38.100 --> 12:39.933
I understand that she
has never been in trouble.

12:39.967 --> 12:42.433
I think we could leave this
to the parents.

12:42.467 --> 12:47.333
She needs to understand
that, this is just the beginning
of, she is obviously...

12:47.367 --> 12:49.200
-(phone chimes)
-getting into the wrong crowd.

12:49.233 --> 12:51.100
-Oh my God, if my husband come,
he gonna kill me.

12:51.133 --> 12:52.500
-(laughs)
-Can I just go home,

12:52.533 --> 12:54.900
I'm gonna take her
and I'm gonna talk to her.

12:54.933 --> 12:57.200
-Yeah. That-- That's--
That's absolutely fine.

12:57.233 --> 12:58.933
Give us just one second.
Thank you, ma'am.

12:58.967 --> 13:01.800
Hey, Sofia?
I'm not here to ruin
your life, okay?

13:01.833 --> 13:04.733
What I'm here to do
is teach you lessons,
so that, when you're 18,

13:04.767 --> 13:08.200
19, 20, you're making
the right decisions,
not the wrong ones, okay?

13:08.233 --> 13:09.667
All right.
-Thank you so much.

13:09.700 --> 13:11.567
-Go home.
-Thank you so much, guys.

13:14.533 --> 13:16.600
-Bye!
-Okay, Ishmael.

13:16.633 --> 13:18.167
Listen, you're gonna be
charged with possession

13:18.200 --> 13:21.067
of a concealed firearm, okay?
What you have in the car tonight

13:21.067 --> 13:24.567
as an 18-year-old boy
is unacceptable.

13:24.600 --> 13:26.633
You have no idea
whose it was,

13:26.667 --> 13:29.100
if it was stolen,
if it's a murder weapon?

13:29.133 --> 13:31.567
What this is
for you is this
is a learning experience.

13:31.600 --> 13:33.500
Every action has a consequence.

13:36.067 --> 13:39.133
-You know, workin'
in Pahrump, you know, people
think it's a sleepy town.

13:39.167 --> 13:41.067
It's actually quite busy,

13:41.067 --> 13:43.367
with Las Vegas
being an hour away,

13:43.400 --> 13:46.967
you know, a lot of people
move out here to get away
from the bright lights

13:47.067 --> 13:48.133
of Las Vegas.

13:48.167 --> 13:49.900
It gets out here
pretty dark.

13:49.933 --> 13:52.200
I've got this car
that just pulled up
to the intersection.

13:52.233 --> 13:55.133
He saw my car
and immediately put it
in reverse

13:55.167 --> 13:56.600
and started backin' up.

13:56.633 --> 13:58.500
So I'm gonna go ahead
and do a traffic stop
on him and see,

13:58.533 --> 14:00.400
see what his issue is.

14:00.433 --> 14:02.867
So we'll pull in here.
-(radio chatter)

14:12.933 --> 14:14.467
-Hey, what's doin', man?
-That was my fault.

14:14.500 --> 14:17.100
I whistled to him I had
to get something out of my car.

14:17.133 --> 14:19.867
-Here's the thing,
you were backin' up
in the wrong way of traffic.

14:19.900 --> 14:23.367
-I'm sorry about that.
He just dropped me off at work.
-Okay. Cool.

14:23.400 --> 14:25.400
-He just dropped me off
a Pepsi, and my straws
are in the car.

14:25.433 --> 14:26.933
-Okay. Cool.
-Sorry about that.

14:26.967 --> 14:28.167
-You mind
steppin' over here for me?

14:28.200 --> 14:29.300
-Yeah.
-Hey, ma'am?

14:29.333 --> 14:31.233
Can you stay over here?
Thank you.

14:31.267 --> 14:33.067
-I'm sorry, what?
-Can you just stay over here
for me?

14:33.067 --> 14:34.900
-Sure.
-Just keep your hands
out of your pockets, brother.

14:34.933 --> 14:36.433
-Sorry.
-Now come right back
over here.

14:36.467 --> 14:38.833
-Okay.
-Right back here.
'Cause you saw how suspicious

14:38.867 --> 14:40.733
it looked, (indistinct)
right there, you look,

14:40.767 --> 14:43.833
you see me,
immediately start backin' up.
-Yeah. Oh, no,

14:43.867 --> 14:46.167
she was whistlin'
from the door right there.

14:46.200 --> 14:48.533
-Okay.
Do you-- Do you have
your license, registration,

14:48.567 --> 14:50.167
proof of insurance with you?
-Yeah. She's got it.

14:50.200 --> 14:52.067
-And do me a favor,
keep your hands
out of your pockets.

14:52.067 --> 14:54.300
-I'm sorry, I gotta
get my license for you.
-That's called littering.

14:54.333 --> 14:56.900
And you hit me with that.
So I'd really appreciate
you not throw your cigarette

14:56.933 --> 14:58.900
and hit me with it.
-I thought I threw it
right in my pocket.

14:58.933 --> 15:00.267
-But you threw it
and hit me with it.

15:00.300 --> 15:02.067
-I'm sorry, sir.
I'm just nervous.

15:02.067 --> 15:04.533
-What are you nervous for?
-Because I'm not used
to gettin' pulled over.

15:04.567 --> 15:06.200
-Because I just made him
get pulled over by a cop.

15:06.233 --> 15:07.933
-I'm gonna put my hands
on the car.
-All right, man.

15:07.967 --> 15:10.233
Hey, James, is there anything
in your car I should know about,
my man?

15:10.267 --> 15:12.367
-It's my car.
-Is there anything
in your car I should know about?

15:12.400 --> 15:14.467
-No, sir.
-Okay. Would you mind
if I look?

15:14.500 --> 15:18.067
-Yeah. I mean, go ahead.
It's not my car, I'm sorry.

15:18.067 --> 15:21.133
-Well, you're drivin' it.
-He just dropped me off
for work.

15:21.167 --> 15:23.167
-So you're--
-I just dropped her off
at work.

15:23.200 --> 15:25.467
-But you're drivin' it,
so that puts you
in possession of it.

15:25.500 --> 15:28.633
So that makes you liable
for anything that's
inside of that vehicle.

15:28.667 --> 15:30.533
-Yeah, okay.
-Is there a reason
to look in my car?

15:30.567 --> 15:32.867
-I'm just askin'.
I'm askin' you.

15:32.900 --> 15:35.767
Hey, I'm just gonna check,
and make sure you don't have
any weapons on you real quick,

15:35.800 --> 15:37.200
-okay?
-Yes, sir.

15:37.233 --> 15:38.300
-Do you have anything
on you?
-No.

15:38.333 --> 15:39.667
-Have you been arrested
before?
-Mm, yeah.

15:39.700 --> 15:42.933
-What for?
-Um, last time, speedin',
and, um--

15:42.967 --> 15:45.533
-For speedin'?
What's in your pocket
right here, brother?

15:45.567 --> 15:49.100
-My money and my lighter.
-Don't-- Okay, you mind
if I go ahead and pull it out?

15:49.133 --> 15:51.067
-Why are you
treatin' him so bad?
-I'm not treatin' him bad.

15:51.100 --> 15:52.367
-What's this
right here, brother?

15:52.400 --> 15:53.767
Whoa, no, don't grab it.

15:53.800 --> 15:55.233
-It's probably a pipe.

15:55.267 --> 15:57.333
-You mind if I go and--
and grab it out of there, okay?
-Yeah.

15:57.367 --> 15:59.267
-Go ahead and take it.
-Oh, my.

15:59.300 --> 16:03.433
-Oh, no. Dave's pipe. I'm sorry.
-Okay, do you have any other
methamphetamines in the car?

16:03.467 --> 16:06.067
Stop.
-Go ahead, I know
I'm gettin' arrested.

16:06.067 --> 16:07.867
-You got anything else
on you, brother?
-No.

16:07.900 --> 16:10.533
-Where's your meth at?
-That's my friend's pipe,
I got it out of his truck.

16:10.567 --> 16:12.433
-Let me guess,
those are your friend's
pants, too.

16:12.467 --> 16:14.500
-No, these are my pants.

16:14.533 --> 16:18.500
-(radio chatter)

16:18.533 --> 16:21.200
-Um, code four, I just
need assistance of your partner.

16:22.400 --> 16:23.933
-I don't have any money.

16:23.967 --> 16:25.133
-(radio chatter)

16:25.167 --> 16:27.067
-All right, just, uh--
go ahead and put your hands

16:27.100 --> 16:28.700
right here
on my dashboard, okay?

16:28.733 --> 16:30.300
What's up, brother,
how you doin'?

16:30.333 --> 16:33.567
-What's goin' on?
-Hey, um, so,
I'm comin' down,

16:33.600 --> 16:38.200
comin' down 372.
He's right here
at the, um, stop light.

16:38.233 --> 16:39.700
He sees my car,
throws it in reverse,

16:39.733 --> 16:42.600
and immediately
starts backin' back up
the road.

16:42.633 --> 16:45.733
So I shoot here, pull him over.
Ask him to search his car,
which he gives me,

16:45.767 --> 16:48.233
Um, he's got a pipe
in his pocket, you know,
to use meth.

16:48.267 --> 16:50.300
-Do you mind
if we search your car?

16:50.333 --> 16:51.600
-I don't care. Search my car.

16:51.633 --> 16:55.833
-Okay, cool.
Again, you're-- you're
super shaky.

16:55.867 --> 16:57.600
-Yeah, well, I'm freezin' too.
-Okay.

16:59.400 --> 17:03.933
You said you're goin' to jail.
-Because I know-- I know
you have that on me.

17:03.967 --> 17:06.533
-Right.
So do you have
any other meth on you?

17:06.567 --> 17:08.133
-No, I don't.
-Is there anything
in the car?

17:08.167 --> 17:11.333
-No.
-Okay. I want you to walk
right over here on this side

17:11.367 --> 17:13.400
and just leave that right there,
that's gonna go nowhere.

17:15.400 --> 17:17.167
Cell 16, consent search.

17:17.200 --> 17:19.467
-So how long you been
usin' meth?

17:19.500 --> 17:22.633
-Well, I just barely started.
To be honest with you, again
about a month ago.

17:22.667 --> 17:25.200
So embarrassed,
in front of my little sister,
you know how that is.

17:25.233 --> 17:28.333
I'm her big brother and all,
I'm supposed to not be
doin' that.

17:33.867 --> 17:36.967
-Oh.
-(radio chatter)

17:37.067 --> 17:39.200
-John, we got meth.

17:39.233 --> 17:43.200
-Those are doggie treats.
-So the dog would be interested
in that instead of that source.

17:43.233 --> 17:45.867
-So why'd you lie?
-I didn't, I-- that's
my friend's cig--

17:45.900 --> 17:47.433
pack of cigarettes,
sir, to be honest with you.

17:47.467 --> 17:49.633
My friend Dave.

17:49.667 --> 17:53.067
-So you didn't know the meth--
-I didn't know there was
no meth in the car at all.

17:53.067 --> 17:55.400
My cigarettes are Newports,
I just bought 'em.

17:55.433 --> 17:57.067
I smoke Newports.

17:57.067 --> 17:58.567
-You gotta kick the habit,
it's gonna kill you.

17:58.600 --> 18:00.200
-This is it, you just helped
me do it just now.

18:00.233 --> 18:03.267
-You gotta kick it.
-You just did it for me,
just now.

18:03.300 --> 18:04.767
It's so embarrassing for me.

18:04.800 --> 18:05.967
I'm so embarrassed.

18:06.067 --> 18:07.633
-Yeah, cool.

18:07.667 --> 18:10.167
Have a seat right here
in my car, all right?

18:10.200 --> 18:11.533
Watch your head.

18:11.567 --> 18:12.767
-You gonna
take these handcuffs off?

18:12.800 --> 18:14.967
-In a minute, when another
deputy gets here, okay?

18:15.067 --> 18:17.700
All right, my man,
so, you're goin' to jail
for possession

18:17.733 --> 18:18.967
of a controlled substance,

18:19.067 --> 18:21.100
and the possession
of drug paraphernalia,
all right?

18:21.133 --> 18:24.133
-Yes, sir.
-And the unsafe backing.
(chuckles)

18:24.167 --> 18:28.067
All right?
So, I guess it was kind
of a bad time

18:28.067 --> 18:32.900
when you-- when you decided
to, you know, back up
and floor it down the highway.

18:32.933 --> 18:34.700
All right?

18:34.733 --> 18:37.200
-I'm sorry I did that, too,
but, my sister whistled,
you know, I looked--

18:37.233 --> 18:39.333
-I got you.
All right, man.

18:39.367 --> 18:41.933
I understand the situation,
but, you know, it--
unfortunately, it's one

18:41.967 --> 18:43.433
of those things,
it is what it is.

18:43.467 --> 18:44.467
-All right.
-All right?

18:44.500 --> 18:46.733
-Yes, sir.

18:46.767 --> 18:48.833
-So, your brother's
going to jail, you know,

18:48.867 --> 18:50.933
for a felony offense.

18:50.967 --> 18:52.967
-He--
-He's an old man.

18:53.067 --> 18:57.133
-But-- He's an old man that--
-You gotta help him
get clean, though, you know?

18:57.167 --> 19:00.100
Help him get clean,
help him change his life
to b-- He said he didn't

19:00.133 --> 19:02.200
do meth for four years,
-No, he didn't.

19:02.233 --> 19:04.167
-and now he just,
bam, all of a sudden?
You gotta get him--

19:04.200 --> 19:06.533
help him get clean, you know?
-He started hangin' around--
I know why.

19:06.567 --> 19:09.133
-A bad crowd?
-Yep. No, it's just
one person.

19:09.167 --> 19:11.867
-Keep-- Yeah, get him
in church, get him
in sports, somethin',

19:11.900 --> 19:14.067
I don't know, s--
badminton. Chess.

19:14.100 --> 19:16.867
-Chess.
-That's what I told him,
I go, "Bro--

19:16.900 --> 19:19.633
-That makes me suicidal,
playin' chess.
-(laughing)

19:19.667 --> 19:22.533
-I said, "Brother, you gotta
quit or you're gonna die,
man," and we don't want

19:22.567 --> 19:24.233
anybody to die.
-He's all I got.

19:24.267 --> 19:25.800
When he dies, I'm--
that's it.

19:25.833 --> 19:28.733
-You gotta pound that
in his head, put that
in his head, seriously.

19:28.767 --> 19:31.200
-I think we're good,
so you can have a good night,
and go back to work,

19:31.233 --> 19:32.333
and hopefully
you make some money.

19:32.367 --> 19:33.700
-Oh, yeah.
-All right.

19:33.733 --> 19:35.467
-A whole lot.
I had six figures a year
at Starlight Video.

19:35.500 --> 19:37.133
-Oh.
-Bye.

19:37.167 --> 19:39.267
-Found that pipe in his pocket.
As soon as it came out,

19:39.300 --> 19:41.433
he looked at her
and said, "Call Paul.
I'm goin' to jail."

19:41.467 --> 19:43.600
(laughs)
He got super nervous,
and it was like,

19:43.633 --> 19:45.500
all right,
there's-- there's
more of this,

19:45.533 --> 19:48.233
and you know,
where there's a pipe,
there's meth.

19:50.433 --> 19:51.800
-132 and Bush, I've got him
at gunpoint.

19:51.833 --> 19:54.133
-Dispatcher:
Okay, gunpoint, 132 and Bush.

19:54.167 --> 19:55.300
Cover is code three.

19:55.333 --> 19:58.300
-(overlapping
police radio chatter)

20:03.967 --> 20:05.933
-Dispatcher:
Okay, we'll still send
a code three.

20:05.967 --> 20:07.867
-(theme music playing)
