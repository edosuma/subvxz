02:00.871 --> 02:03.090
Police are sure only of the following:

02:03.190 --> 02:05.651
He is male and savagely powerful.

02:05.751 --> 02:10.299
In almost all cases he has battered his way
to his victims through locked doors,

02:10.399 --> 02:15.327
and he is so intelligent he has managed not
only to allude police for these 9 months,

02:15.427 --> 02:17.996
but escape identification of any kind.

02:18.096 --> 02:19.898
And now it has happened again.

02:19.998 --> 02:23.377
In the early hours of this morning,
the killer struck once more.

02:23.477 --> 02:28.507
Again killing an entire family,
again escaping without being seen.

02:28.607 --> 02:30.675
And this cityâ€™s descent into frustration

02:30.775 --> 02:33.597
- and terror deepens.
- Jonathan?

02:33.697 --> 02:36.600
Schneider caught five touchdowns
against Dallas last night.

02:36.700 --> 02:39.798
What are you watching this crud for?
Where's my Coke?

02:39.955 --> 02:43.274
I haven't had a good night's sleep
in over a month because of that creep.

02:43.374 --> 02:46.577
If you don't like the news, Doreen,
change the channel.

02:47.294 --> 02:49.822
I hope you don't play football
like you live your life.

02:49.922 --> 02:50.990
- Hey, Jon.
- Get a job, Carson.

02:51.090 --> 02:52.253
Go. Hut!

02:57.888 --> 02:59.228
Go, go, go!

02:59.639 --> 03:00.921
I'm very good.

03:01.058 --> 03:02.090
Way to go, Jonathan.

03:09.233 --> 03:10.884
Keep looking at the girls, Romeo.

03:10.984 --> 03:13.595
- You're making me look good.
- It was a lucky shot, Rhino.

03:13.695 --> 03:17.457
What the hell has happened
to your concentration, Jonathan?

03:17.658 --> 03:19.793
Are you staying in training, or what?

03:21.161 --> 03:23.380
Or are you sneaking out at night?

03:23.747 --> 03:25.823
Training, Coach, I swear to God.

03:26.374 --> 03:28.778
You know, you could be
one for the record books, Jonathan.

03:28.878 --> 03:31.831
You come up the hard way,
you got great talent...

03:32.172 --> 03:34.157
but I don't know if you got greatness.

03:34.257 --> 03:38.369
In order for you to be great, you gotta be
able to concentrate your will to greatness...

03:38.469 --> 03:39.996
or when you look the other way...

03:40.096 --> 03:42.944
someone's gonna come up
and help cream your ass!

03:43.726 --> 03:47.985
Like that poor young lady sitting over there
in the stands with no shirt on.

03:48.354 --> 03:50.381
You see? That's what I'm talking about.

03:50.481 --> 03:52.342
It won't happen again, Coach. I promise.

03:52.442 --> 03:54.428
Now get the hell on back to the huddle.

03:54.528 --> 03:56.555
Get back to the huddle, let's move it!

03:56.655 --> 03:58.557
Looks like you've been
up all night screwing, boy.

03:58.657 --> 04:00.642
No, man. I haven't been able
to sleep, that's all.

04:00.742 --> 04:03.143
You get more ass than a toilet seat.
Don't lie to your man Rhino.

04:03.243 --> 04:07.255
Just do me a favour. Shut up and fix
your laces before you kill yourself.

04:09.625 --> 04:10.658
All right!

04:12.628 --> 04:13.661
Go. Come on!

04:23.264 --> 04:26.052
Sorry, Rhino.
Where there's a will there's a way.

04:30.104 --> 04:31.350
Are you okay?

04:35.984 --> 04:39.685
- Instant karma.
- Karma? I got hit by a karma?

04:41.198 --> 04:44.643
That's more like it, Jonathan.
That's concentration.

04:44.743 --> 04:47.461
That's using your will and your head.

04:48.956 --> 04:52.158
Oh, you look like shit, incidentally.
Come on, get up.

04:52.876 --> 04:54.485
Take it in for the rest of the day.

04:54.585 --> 04:56.248
Attack from the rear. Let's go.

04:56.588 --> 04:57.823
You okay?

04:57.923 --> 04:58.990
No problem.

04:59.090 --> 05:01.629
All right. You guys, back to the huddle.

05:03.803 --> 05:06.539
You could have a mild concussion.
Do you wanna see the doctor?

05:06.639 --> 05:09.025
No, I'm okay, Pac Man. I'm all right.

05:13.146 --> 05:14.487
Oh, God.

05:15.065 --> 05:16.090
Christ.

05:16.190 --> 05:18.384
- Hey, are you okay?
- Yeah.

05:18.484 --> 05:21.996
- Are you sure you're okay?
- I'm all right. Go ahead. Seriously.

05:25.200 --> 05:26.955
Are you sure you're okay?

05:27.118 --> 05:30.997
- Do I know you?
- Alison. Alison Clement?

05:31.915 --> 05:34.240
I sit next to you in chemistry.

05:35.084 --> 05:37.753
We've been going out
on and off for a year.

05:37.962 --> 05:41.059
You once told me
you wanted me to bear your children.

05:42.341 --> 05:44.216
- Did you?
- Did I what?

05:44.678 --> 05:46.663
Did you bear my children?
I mean, maybe we...

05:46.763 --> 05:50.214
We haven't had children yet.
We haven't even slept together.

05:50.432 --> 05:53.695
That's good.
I wanna be respected as a person first.

05:54.186 --> 05:55.218
That's good.

05:56.271 --> 05:58.183
Come on, I'll walk you home.

06:02.527 --> 06:05.481
- Straight to bed with you.
- Now we're talking.

06:06.365 --> 06:08.334
You're crazy, you know that?

06:13.872 --> 06:15.035
What?

06:18.126 --> 06:19.632
Something...

06:30.972 --> 06:32.727
Jonathan, where are we?

06:33.266 --> 06:36.932
I was raised on this street.
My family still lives here.

06:39.105 --> 06:41.074
That's their house right there.

06:42.651 --> 06:44.905
Who's working on the TV at this hour?

06:55.497 --> 06:57.999
Alison, I don't think you should...

07:30.572 --> 07:31.783
Bobby?

07:37.538 --> 07:40.551
No!

07:41.875 --> 07:43.666
Jonathan, help us!

07:47.213 --> 07:48.935
You get away from her.

07:49.508 --> 07:51.727
What are you doing here, dipshit?

07:52.636 --> 07:55.164
- Do you wanna watch?
- Jonathan, do something!

07:55.264 --> 07:57.766
Shut up, bitch! Do you wanna watch?

07:59.601 --> 08:01.013
Watch this.

08:01.604 --> 08:03.739
- Get him out of here!
- Diane!

08:03.856 --> 08:04.947
Come on!

08:07.317 --> 08:08.907
No!

08:10.153 --> 08:11.814
Jonathan, are you okay?

08:11.946 --> 08:14.475
Where am I? What happened?

08:14.575 --> 08:17.587
Remember, you ran into the goal post?
You whacked your head.

08:18.869 --> 08:22.536
- What are you doing here?
- I stayed. I was worried about you.

08:23.874 --> 08:26.829
Are you sure you're okay?
You seem different.

08:27.879 --> 08:29.539
Something's different.

08:37.681 --> 08:38.712
Hello.

08:40.015 --> 08:42.020
Hello, Lt. Parker. Hold on.

08:44.436 --> 08:46.157
It's your father.

08:51.485 --> 08:52.613
Don.

08:56.907 --> 08:59.043
Don, is the family all right?

09:03.456 --> 09:04.702
Jonathan?

09:07.042 --> 09:07.151
Okay, I'm gonna need
another ambulance here.

09:07.251 --> 09:08.652
Okay, I'm gonna need
another ambulance here.

09:08.752 --> 09:10.543
It's gonna be okay.

09:22.766 --> 09:25.233
You don't wanna go in there. I mean it.

09:26.311 --> 09:29.840
Jonathan, hold off. Don't.
Just listen to your dad.

09:29.940 --> 09:31.091
Bobby?

09:31.191 --> 09:33.718
Hey, guys, come on, let's go.
Let's make this snappy.

09:33.818 --> 09:35.693
Sally and Mum?

09:37.447 --> 09:41.908
They're all gone. I tried to tell you,
there's nothing you can do here.

09:42.202 --> 09:45.156
Hey, get that reporter out of there.
Get her out.

09:54.005 --> 09:56.081
Come on, we got a gurney coming in.

10:00.219 --> 10:04.916
Donnie, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
She was the best.

10:05.016 --> 10:08.044
- Lt. Parker?
- I knew this was gonna happen.

10:08.144 --> 10:11.548
Lt. Parker, with the killer now murdering
your own family, will this intensify...

10:11.648 --> 10:14.424
...phantom-like devastator of families
struck again late last night.

10:14.524 --> 10:17.512
This time, killing the wife
and two foster children...

10:17.612 --> 10:20.472
of the detective
leading the search for the killer.

10:20.572 --> 10:23.309
Local college football star
Jonathan Parker, seen here...

10:23.409 --> 10:26.187
was also a foster child
raised by the couple.

10:26.287 --> 10:29.704
After being found beaten and near death
when he was just 7 years old.

10:31.375 --> 10:36.049
For a while this rainy afternoon, the city
took time to mourn its latest loss...

10:36.296 --> 10:39.449
as the close friends of Lt. Donald
Parker and Jonathan Parker...

10:39.549 --> 10:42.504
gathered with them
to lay their loved ones to rest.

10:44.096 --> 10:48.166
As yet, Parker and his police have still
not so much as identified the killer...

10:48.266 --> 10:52.170
who has claimed seven families to date.
Almost 30 souls.

10:52.270 --> 10:54.988
And left an entire city afraid to sleep.

10:55.232 --> 10:57.901
Who is this man? What motivates him?

10:58.360 --> 10:59.570
And more importantly...

11:00.237 --> 11:02.242
Oh, God! Change the channel.

11:08.286 --> 11:11.039
Can't go anywhere without hearing
about the son of a bitch.

11:13.124 --> 11:15.129
Hi, Jonathan. What'll you have?

11:15.251 --> 11:18.514
- Jack Daniel's on the rocks.
- I'll have a Coke, please.

11:20.799 --> 11:24.630
- I guess you're wondering why I called you?
- Yeah, I guess I am.

11:26.720 --> 11:30.802
I dreamt of the murders, Don.
Just the way they happened.

11:32.810 --> 11:35.693
Things like this happen,
people get bad dreams.

11:36.648 --> 11:38.591
I've had a few of my own lately.

11:38.691 --> 11:41.538
Don, no, I dreamt of it
the night it happened.

11:41.777 --> 11:43.438
Before you called me.

11:44.071 --> 11:46.705
I saw what happened in the house.

11:47.908 --> 11:50.447
You don't know
what happened in that house.

11:50.995 --> 11:52.536
You don't wanna know.

11:52.871 --> 11:55.091
Bobby was killed in the living room.

11:55.750 --> 11:58.418
The flashlight was laying
right next to him.

11:59.044 --> 12:01.583
The fingers on his right hand
were broken.

12:04.841 --> 12:06.313
These three.

12:08.596 --> 12:11.229
Diane and Sally
got it up in Sally's room.

12:11.640 --> 12:14.558
- What is this shit?
- That's how it was, isn't it?

12:16.478 --> 12:18.797
I don't know what the hell
you're talking about.

12:18.897 --> 12:20.440
This is so crazy.

12:21.150 --> 12:24.910
I knew it was more than a dream, Don.
It was so real.

12:25.070 --> 12:27.110
I could smell the blood.

12:30.408 --> 12:32.817
I know what this guy looks like.

12:33.912 --> 12:36.072
I even know he has a limp.

12:39.834 --> 12:43.666
Because I'm your father doesn't mean
I have to listen to this crap.

12:48.802 --> 12:49.911
Don, just hold on a second.

12:50.011 --> 12:53.890
Hey, what the hell's with you?
Are you on drugs, or what?

12:56.350 --> 12:59.483
Did you find tracks of a van
in front of the house?

13:01.940 --> 13:03.481
How'd you know that?

13:04.775 --> 13:09.605
I saw it, Don. I saw him. I saw his van.

13:13.617 --> 13:15.408
I saw his name on the van.

13:16.746 --> 13:19.249
I bet I can take you to where he works.

13:20.207 --> 13:21.567
You tell me, I'll check it out.

13:21.667 --> 13:24.487
No, I'm in on this. I'm there.
That way or no way.

13:24.587 --> 13:26.322
That's against procedure, you know it.

13:26.422 --> 13:30.052
Yeah. Well, fuck procedure, Don.
Do you want this guy or not?

13:52.072 --> 13:54.057
I didn't even know this place was here.

13:54.157 --> 13:57.444
- This is it.
- This is it?

13:57.577 --> 14:00.081
- Mike, come here.
- I can feel him.

14:02.081 --> 14:06.590
- This is screwball beyond belief.
- It's just like the dream.

14:07.670 --> 14:09.806
- You two go around back.
- Okay.

14:10.006 --> 14:13.293
- What's all the lights inside?
- Televisions.

14:13.844 --> 14:15.255
Look at them all.

14:17.054 --> 14:20.041
Look, if I get a chance, we'll come back
when the place is open. Okay?

14:20.141 --> 14:21.612
He's in there.

14:24.229 --> 14:25.255
Break it.

14:25.355 --> 14:27.965
Now, wait a minute.
We don't have a warrant.

14:28.065 --> 14:31.636
- This is breaking and entering, you know.
- The place has already been broken into.

14:31.736 --> 14:34.488
We're investigating
an apparent burglary here.

14:34.655 --> 14:37.159
Right. You're right.

14:39.076 --> 14:41.461
This is all because he had a dream?

16:01.990 --> 16:05.942
- Thought you said he was here.
- I thought he was.

16:09.081 --> 16:11.122
Keep dreaming, Lieutenant.

16:55.794 --> 16:56.921
Dan';?

17:03.467 --> 17:07.098
- Wasn't one of your guys just here?
- How the hell should I know?

17:13.185 --> 17:14.277
Sarge?

17:17.148 --> 17:18.240
Sarge?

17:20.984 --> 17:22.455
He was just there.

17:23.445 --> 17:24.691
Jesus Christ.

17:27.907 --> 17:29.321
Call for backup.

17:30.704 --> 17:32.424
Call for backup!

17:52.474 --> 17:54.710
Parker gonna keep us here all night,
or what?

17:54.810 --> 17:57.135
Really. I could use a cold one.

18:02.901 --> 18:03.933
Judas.

18:04.194 --> 18:07.611
You scared the crap out of me, Sarge.
Did you find anything?

19:29.903 --> 19:32.822
- I can find him again.
- You stay out of this!

19:33.199 --> 19:35.488
This is my business, police business!

19:35.743 --> 19:37.770
And this fucker just killed
four of my men!

19:37.870 --> 19:40.105
You think you can mess
with a guy like that?

19:40.205 --> 19:43.301
You get the hell home
and let me deal with this!

19:54.469 --> 19:55.661
Good morning, Maryville.

19:55.761 --> 19:57.831
Although the sun
has finally come out today...

19:57.931 --> 20:01.134
it doesn't help for a city
afraid to unlock its windows.

20:01.310 --> 20:04.420
Last night, a man thought to be
the long sought after slasher...

20:04.520 --> 20:08.341
was surrounded by police, only to escape
in a burst of new killings...

20:08.441 --> 20:11.970
that left four officers dead
and a police department in shock.

20:12.070 --> 20:15.682
His name is Horace Pinker.
A virtual phantom until yesterday...

20:15.782 --> 20:20.019
he was described for this police drawing
through a most unusual means.

20:20.119 --> 20:21.603
According to the police report...

20:21.703 --> 20:26.276
Jonathan Parker, foster son of Maryville
Police Department's Lt. Donald Parker...

20:26.376 --> 20:28.236
dreamed of the killer.

20:28.336 --> 20:29.778
A junior at Mid Western Tech,
Jonathan...

20:29.878 --> 20:33.073
apparently was able to find Pinker's name
in a local phone book...

20:33.173 --> 20:36.410
after recalling it from a dream he had
the night of the murders.

20:36.510 --> 20:37.852
Now, strange as it...

21:08.541 --> 21:09.918
Twenty.

21:24.725 --> 21:26.101
Jonathan?

21:29.896 --> 21:32.435
Aren't you forgetting
your 9:00 practise?

21:33.816 --> 21:36.735
No. I'm going.

21:38.404 --> 21:39.686
I'm going.

21:41.491 --> 21:45.406
- Where the hell's my philosophy book?
- Under your jacket.

21:50.584 --> 21:51.860
Are you okay?

21:51.960 --> 21:55.910
Yeah, I'm good.
I'm just worried about this exam.

21:56.422 --> 21:59.117
Your dad's gonna catch him
now that he knows who he is.

21:59.217 --> 22:01.471
He's never seen him, Alison.

22:03.721 --> 22:05.477
Only I have.

22:10.644 --> 22:12.435
I almost forgot.

22:15.942 --> 22:17.603
Happy birthday.

22:20.613 --> 22:24.789
Jonathan, in the middle of all this
I can't believe you'd even remember.

22:30.706 --> 22:32.296
It's beautiful.

22:43.135 --> 22:45.045
Thanks for sticking around.

22:51.185 --> 22:52.845
You'll be late.

22:54.271 --> 22:58.102
- Are you okay?
- I'm happy.

22:59.525 --> 23:01.928
Go. I'll see you at practise.

23:02.028 --> 23:03.440
- Bye.
- Bye.

23:07.575 --> 23:10.423
Jonathan Parker, I love you so much.

23:34.393 --> 23:36.778
...suggest a man with shaven head.

23:38.272 --> 23:40.341
The storm continues
to remain in the area.

23:40.441 --> 23:43.219
Last night, pouring three inches of rain
in outlying districts...

23:43.319 --> 23:45.388
accompanied by high winds.

23:45.488 --> 23:48.932
In local news, Maryville': college
football hero, Jonathan Parker...

23:49.032 --> 23:50.976
has pledged to play
in Saturday's game...

23:51.076 --> 23:54.189
despite his harrowing brush last night
with the Maryville Slasher...

23:54.289 --> 23:56.357
now known by name as Horace Pinker.

23:56.457 --> 24:00.027
A man who apparently, from evidence
uncovered in a hidden room in his shop...

24:00.127 --> 24:02.738
practiced black magic
and animal sacrifice.

24:02.838 --> 24:07.159
Police Lt. Donald Parker described the place
as a "Hell hole filled with evil instruments...

24:07.259 --> 24:10.142
"strange symbols,
and hundreds of mummified cats."

24:13.223 --> 24:15.666
He apparently struck again
early this morning...

24:15.766 --> 24:17.712
killing a family of live in their sleep.

24:17.812 --> 24:21.215
In this, the latest work of what is thought,
because of distinctive patterns...

24:21.315 --> 24:24.731
police refuse to make public,
to be the Family Slasher.

24:28.904 --> 24:32.393
Although Pinker was thought to have
escaped a police dragnet and left the city...

24:32.493 --> 24:35.838
recent evidence suggests
he has mysteriously doubled back...

25:05.232 --> 25:07.143
Please, God, keep him safe.

25:31.926 --> 25:34.162
All right! That's more like it. Okay.

25:34.262 --> 25:35.637
Take five!

25:40.100 --> 25:42.948
- You guys seen Alison?
- No.

25:44.396 --> 25:45.867
Hey, Jonathan.

25:47.941 --> 25:49.104
Come here.

25:49.401 --> 25:52.118
- You better go home, son.
- Why's that?

25:53.613 --> 25:55.404
You better go home.

26:09.546 --> 26:11.072
Jonathan.

26:11.172 --> 26:12.834
Who let him in here?

26:14.342 --> 26:16.477
Jonathan, you don't wanna go in there.

26:18.137 --> 26:22.088
- Go outside and see if you can find his dad.
- Somebody go get him!

26:44.538 --> 26:45.880
Right this way. In there, sir.

26:49.376 --> 26:52.010
Come on. You don't want to see this.

26:56.258 --> 26:58.285
What the hell
did you let him in there for?

26:58.385 --> 26:59.548
For Christ's sake!

27:22.576 --> 27:23.952
Poor baby.

27:28.832 --> 27:30.706
I'll love you forever.

27:42.469 --> 27:45.139
...when our Lord takes us all
to be with Him.

27:46.098 --> 27:50.180
In the name of the Father, the Son
and the Holy Spirit.

27:50.771 --> 27:51.933
Amen.

27:52.605 --> 27:56.401
And now, may Alison Clement
rest in peace.

28:36.690 --> 28:38.446
Do you know what to do?

28:38.609 --> 28:41.646
Yeah. I think you're tripping
but I know what to do.

28:41.862 --> 28:45.148
Good. Fasten your seat belt.

29:12.975 --> 29:15.480
- Don't leave me hanging.
- Son of a bitch!

29:16.188 --> 29:17.220
No!

29:24.153 --> 29:25.624
No!

29:28.992 --> 29:31.910
- No, help us!
- Pinker!

29:32.078 --> 29:33.738
How you doing, Horace?

29:35.497 --> 29:38.346
Why don't you let her go?
Come take me on!

29:42.421 --> 29:44.830
You wanna play, you little piss-ant?

29:45.633 --> 29:47.673
For God's sake, do something!

29:51.138 --> 29:53.677
Do you wanna play in this game, boy?

29:54.683 --> 29:55.846
Rhino?

29:57.060 --> 30:00.822
- Rhino?
- Rhino.

30:03.358 --> 30:04.949
You got it, asshole!

30:05.111 --> 30:06.273
Rhino!

30:07.612 --> 30:09.522
Yo, yo!

30:13.160 --> 30:17.241
- Shit!
- I do it right?

30:17.999 --> 30:20.881
You did it perfect, Rhino. Perfect.

30:21.626 --> 30:24.722
Maddalena and Wagner.

30:55.368 --> 30:58.465
Yeah. This looks like the place.
I think.

30:58.829 --> 31:01.546
You swear this ain't a put on, right?

31:07.964 --> 31:09.573
All right. Hold it. Don't move.

31:09.673 --> 31:11.086
You heard what he said.

31:14.052 --> 31:15.713
- Lieutenant?
- Yeah?

31:21.769 --> 31:23.087
Evening, Jonny.

31:23.187 --> 31:26.638
- What are you doing here?
- My job. What are you doing here?

31:27.941 --> 31:31.074
- It's coming from upstairs.
- Keep these two guys here!

31:31.570 --> 31:33.646
- Back it up, boys.
- Let's go, move it!

31:34.281 --> 31:35.527
No!

31:45.709 --> 31:47.430
Freeze!

31:48.545 --> 31:51.084
You bastard. I'll blow your head off.

31:51.298 --> 31:54.810
Go ahead! Take your best shot!
She won't mind!

31:57.012 --> 32:00.144
I see you had to bring Daddy along, huh?

32:01.099 --> 32:04.645
Hey, you boys hungry down there?
You hungry?

32:04.810 --> 32:06.187
Well, eat this!

32:09.941 --> 32:11.566
- Jonathan!
- Come on.

32:29.168 --> 32:30.199
No!

32:36.967 --> 32:38.723
- There he is.
- Yeah.

32:39.261 --> 32:41.789
All right, back down.
Cover the other building.

32:41.889 --> 32:42.921
All right, let's go.

32:51.190 --> 32:53.100
Jonathan, forget it, man.

32:56.821 --> 32:58.232
Oh, Jesus!

33:37.152 --> 33:38.362
Come on!

33:54.210 --> 33:55.319
Drop it!

33:55.419 --> 33:59.122
Drop it! God damn it, I mean it!
On the ground!

34:01.509 --> 34:05.204
- Cuff him and get him out of here.
- Go ahead, man, shoot me.

34:05.304 --> 34:08.934
And by the way, boy,
she died real hard, you know?

34:10.226 --> 34:11.733
Your girlfriend?

34:12.020 --> 34:15.471
I'll see you dead, you son of a bitch!

34:15.688 --> 34:18.050
You like killing, too, squirt?
It's in the blood.

34:18.150 --> 34:21.636
- You and me, we're killers.
- You'll die, you motherfucker!

34:21.735 --> 34:24.656
I'll see you die! You fucker!

34:26.867 --> 34:29.371
You're breaking my fucking heart!

34:31.871 --> 34:36.047
Easy now. You want him gone,
let the State do it for you.

34:36.460 --> 34:38.679
He'll fry for sure. He's history.

34:39.588 --> 34:42.601
I wanna be there.

34:43.675 --> 34:47.626
- What?
- If they give him the chair, I wanna be there.

34:48.556 --> 34:50.145
Don't be crazy.

34:51.933 --> 34:54.507
It's over. Now let it go.

34:55.311 --> 34:59.452
I wanna see him die, Don.
I've earned it. I wanna see him die.

35:03.445 --> 35:05.664
Yeah, maybe we've both earned it.

35:06.823 --> 35:08.614
I'll get box seats.

36:49.548 --> 36:51.056
Where is he?

36:52.385 --> 36:54.639
Choking on his last meal, I hope.

36:56.889 --> 37:01.084
Do you know what his last wish was?
TV set in his cell. Can you believe that?

37:01.184 --> 37:02.836
He must like his soaps?

37:02.936 --> 37:05.096
All right, my son, it's time to...

37:07.858 --> 37:09.105
Pinker!

37:12.821 --> 37:15.611
You all right? Stay away from the bars!

37:15.908 --> 37:17.000
Get up!

37:17.493 --> 37:20.411
Come on, give it to me!

37:23.332 --> 37:25.550
You got it, baby.

37:39.514 --> 37:41.354
Get those cables off him.

37:44.102 --> 37:46.713
What the hell was that in the air?
Did you see it?

37:46.813 --> 37:50.395
Smoke, I guess.
Must have fried his fucking brains.

37:51.609 --> 37:52.737
Asshole.

37:53.863 --> 37:54.972
Put him down here.

37:55.072 --> 37:56.447
God damn this!

37:57.491 --> 37:59.495
God damn this blasphemy!

38:05.332 --> 38:06.692
You better do mouth-to-mouth.

38:06.792 --> 38:08.985
My ass. You do mouth-to-mouth.
This guy's an animal.

38:09.085 --> 38:12.238
The Warden hears we let him zap himself,
we're gonna get our asses canned.

38:12.338 --> 38:14.308
- No way.
- Shit!

38:31.858 --> 38:34.242
Open up!

38:40.199 --> 38:42.039
Finger-licking good.

38:44.161 --> 38:45.632
Fucking animal!

38:52.252 --> 38:53.794
Shut the fuck up!

38:54.128 --> 38:56.704
Get those men down to the infirmary!

38:58.383 --> 39:00.045
Is the fucker alive?

39:02.887 --> 39:04.395
I don't know.

39:08.519 --> 39:10.903
Well, I'm fine, boys. Just fine.

39:12.314 --> 39:14.319
Let's get on with the killing.

39:18.111 --> 39:19.832
Okay, pretty boy.

39:21.489 --> 39:24.242
You come to look death in the face,
school boy?

39:25.202 --> 39:26.412
Strap him in.

39:32.876 --> 39:35.130
It isn't right. It just isn't right.

39:35.462 --> 39:37.822
They're treating him
like some kind of animal.

39:37.922 --> 39:40.556
Why give animals such a bad rap?

39:41.175 --> 39:43.202
Would you like to pray with me, my son?

39:43.302 --> 39:47.728
I'm no son of yours. Go pray
with your choir boys, you little pederast!

40:07.367 --> 40:08.436
Ladies and gentlemen.

40:08.536 --> 40:10.980
As warden of this facility,
I'm directed by the State...

40:11.080 --> 40:15.067
to request that you all bear witness
to the execution of Horace Pinker...

40:15.167 --> 40:17.955
in accordance with the laws
of this great state.

40:18.170 --> 40:21.516
In most cases, this is a duty
that I'd rather not be mine.

40:22.091 --> 40:24.879
However, today,
I feel justice is being served.

40:28.388 --> 40:32.718
- Does the prisoner have any final words?
- Yeah, as a matter of fact, I do.

40:35.771 --> 40:39.188
Your pitiful little memory's
wiped it all out, hasn't it?

40:39.942 --> 40:42.018
I used to beat you good, boy.

40:42.319 --> 40:45.472
I was beating you good when
your mama tried to stop me with a gun.

40:45.572 --> 40:48.040
You shut your mouth, you fuck!

40:48.158 --> 40:51.610
The witness will sit down
and remain silent.

40:55.581 --> 41:00.042
- The prisoner has a right to speak.
- That's right.

41:01.421 --> 41:05.659
I was beating you real good when
your mama tried to stop me with that gun...

41:05.759 --> 41:09.021
that she brought into our happy home.

41:12.224 --> 41:15.640
You saw me kill her.
Don't you remember how she screamed?

41:16.811 --> 41:20.214
And how clever you were
grabbing that gun...

41:20.314 --> 41:24.574
and shooting me right through
the fucking knee, you little peckerhead!

41:26.487 --> 41:28.890
Such a big gun...

41:28.990 --> 41:32.869
just blasting away at your daddy
with murder in your eyes.

41:36.372 --> 41:38.341
Like father like son?

41:47.341 --> 41:48.993
What are you waiting for, dickhead?

41:49.093 --> 41:52.724
You wanna fry me?
Then do it, you fucking insect!

41:56.683 --> 41:58.273
You heard the man.

42:03.316 --> 42:06.696
The chair is armed.
Repeat: The chair is armed.

42:06.860 --> 42:09.114
The inner chamber is now sealed.

42:28.548 --> 42:29.580
Get the lights!

42:35.096 --> 42:36.507
Oh, my God.

42:40.769 --> 42:42.049
Shit.

42:47.108 --> 42:49.683
Get in there, Doctor, and check him out.

43:17.054 --> 43:18.145
God damn it!

43:31.526 --> 43:35.667
All right, everybody. Keep your seats.
The guard will show you out.

43:36.490 --> 43:38.935
Lieutenant, the executioner's fried.

43:39.035 --> 43:41.394
- Get me a backup and get your ass back!
- You got it.

43:41.494 --> 43:43.563
- Go, Pastori!
- I'm right behind you, Lieutenant.

43:43.663 --> 43:46.131
I need backup in the chamber! Now!

43:46.833 --> 43:48.067
The guy's had it.

43:48.167 --> 43:51.372
- Help me. Get me to a hospital.
- All right, she's alive.

43:52.380 --> 43:55.033
- Sergeant!
- Yeah?

43:55.133 --> 43:56.243
Call the ambulance.

43:56.343 --> 43:58.536
I can't.
It's already gone with two of our guys.

43:58.636 --> 44:01.414
Get me a car
and get this doctor to a hospital!

44:01.514 --> 44:04.460
- Yeah, hold it down here.
- All cell blocks sealed.

44:04.560 --> 44:06.169
UP here!

44:06.269 --> 44:08.429
Come on, move it, move it!
Check that corridor.

44:08.855 --> 44:11.007
He's not in here. He's gone!

44:11.107 --> 44:13.740
Seal the cell block off! Hurry! Move!

44:14.318 --> 44:17.107
He couldn't have gone far
after taking a hit like that.

44:20.575 --> 44:22.864
Lock down all units.

44:25.788 --> 44:27.864
Forget what he said, Jonathan.

44:29.500 --> 44:30.912
Was it true?

44:32.669 --> 44:37.379
It's been in the papers you're a foster kid.
He's messing with your mind, that's all.

44:37.549 --> 44:38.962
Forget it.

44:53.691 --> 44:56.194
Jon, relax. He's not going anywhere.

44:56.693 --> 44:59.647
They'll find him. Are you all right?

45:13.167 --> 45:14.758
Oh, Christ!

45:37.650 --> 45:41.316
Jesus! That chair really kicks ass.

45:42.989 --> 45:45.623
Yo, get that car in here!

45:49.120 --> 45:50.855
I've got her. I'll get her in.

45:50.955 --> 45:54.538
Leave me alone. I'm fine.
I just need to lie down.

45:55.751 --> 45:57.413
Get her in. Let's go!

46:01.299 --> 46:02.908
What the hell's with her?
I didn't touch her.

46:03.008 --> 46:04.952
What do you expect?
She just got knocked on her ass.

46:05.052 --> 46:06.677
Open up!

46:26.114 --> 46:28.225
How's she doing? Is she gonna make it?

46:28.325 --> 46:31.956
- Yeah. She looks good. Sleeping like a baby.
- Great.

46:34.498 --> 46:38.709
- What the hell are you doing?
- Just feel like a little head, sport.

46:39.836 --> 46:41.117
Let go of him!

47:06.487 --> 47:09.975
What the hell do you mean,
"Where's the doctor?" She's in there.

47:10.075 --> 47:12.578
You got an asbestos ass. Go take a look!

47:13.703 --> 47:16.147
Hey, what are you doing?

47:16.247 --> 47:18.157
What are you, crazy?

47:18.332 --> 47:21.653
Listen. How come you're so interested
in the doctor all of a sudden?

47:21.753 --> 47:24.656
Pinker is dead, Jon.
Go home, get drunk or something.

47:24.756 --> 47:27.533
- I don't think he's dead.
- What are you, crazy?

47:27.633 --> 47:29.618
Yeah, all right.
I know it sounds crazy...

47:29.718 --> 47:34.393
but when I saw that body back there,
I didn't feel anything like I used to. Nothing.

47:34.640 --> 47:36.584
It wasn't him any more. He wasn't there.

47:36.684 --> 47:39.504
That's right! It's nothing but
a bunch of fried meat. And good riddance!

47:39.604 --> 47:42.881
It's just too bad he took
so many people with him, that's all!

47:42.981 --> 47:45.734
Lieutenant? Lieutenant, over here!

47:46.652 --> 47:49.535
- Come on.
- Keep on it, keep it on there!

47:52.199 --> 47:54.643
- He must have been thrown clear.
- Oh, thank God.

47:54.743 --> 47:56.228
- He's lucky.
- Is he gonna make it?

47:56.328 --> 47:59.606
- Yeah, I think so.
- All right, Pastori, hang in there.

47:59.706 --> 48:03.194
Now, we're gonna get you help.
You're gonna be all right, you hear me?

48:03.294 --> 48:04.570
Hang in there now.

48:04.670 --> 48:06.488
- Watch his arm.
- Get him back first.

48:06.588 --> 48:08.740
Okay, get that mask on. Let's go.

48:08.840 --> 48:10.917
Hey, what are you doing?
That's one of my guys.

48:11.051 --> 48:14.162
Watch that bump, push hard.

48:14.262 --> 48:16.801
You go home!
This is enough of this shit!

48:18.058 --> 48:22.068
You gotta trust me, I know something!
You ask him!

48:22.228 --> 48:25.776
You ask him. What happened
to the doctor? Go ask him!

48:27.400 --> 48:29.868
You ask him!

48:31.403 --> 48:33.871
What the hell's with that kid, anyway?

49:40.180 --> 49:44.130
- You've gotta stop him, Jonathan.
- My God.

49:44.601 --> 49:47.389
Alison, he's gone. He's dead.

49:48.521 --> 49:50.396
He's learning how to move.

49:51.441 --> 49:55.321
He's gonna be uncatchable soon.
It'll be slaughter.

49:55.570 --> 49:58.109
Alison, he's gone. I stopped him.

49:59.281 --> 50:01.156
No, he's not.

50:01.283 --> 50:04.072
He's on the move. You've gotta stop him.

50:05.246 --> 50:10.051
Remember our love. Use this.

50:10.293 --> 50:12.987
It'll drive him out. Keep him away.

50:13.087 --> 50:16.101
Alison, please go back. Just go back.

50:16.466 --> 50:19.598
Hold me. I'm so cold, Jonathan.

50:20.302 --> 50:24.347
- Hold me.
- Stop, Alison. You gotta stop!

50:26.475 --> 50:27.888
Alison!

52:25.175 --> 52:28.342
If you're here to see the house,
go next door to the landlord's.

52:30.054 --> 52:31.776
Jonathan, police.

52:34.643 --> 52:39.780
Jonathan, your father, Lt. Parker,
wants to see you down at the station.

52:40.315 --> 52:41.905
I got a car out here.

52:44.570 --> 52:45.887
Jonathan?

52:45.987 --> 52:49.368
This is Jonathan. I'm not home.
Leave a message at the beep.

52:50.617 --> 52:52.352
Jon, this is your dad.

52:52.452 --> 52:53.978
Jonathan, you hear me?

52:54.078 --> 52:58.149
I thought I'd call and tell you,
Pastori, my cop...

52:58.249 --> 53:00.658
that survived the car wreck yesterday?

53:01.044 --> 53:03.071
Well, he's disappeared
from the hospital.

53:03.171 --> 53:06.240
I wondered if you knew
anything about it.

53:06.340 --> 53:07.451
Jon?

53:07.551 --> 53:09.661
Jon, you there?

53:09.761 --> 53:11.386
Open up!

53:19.687 --> 53:20.850
Pastori?

53:30.906 --> 53:33.755
If you won't open up, I will!

53:37.037 --> 53:38.199
Jesus!

53:49.716 --> 53:51.792
Hold it right there, Jonathan!

54:03.272 --> 54:05.507
Why don't you just calm down and...

54:05.607 --> 54:06.698
Jesus!

54:27.670 --> 54:29.213
What's your problem, Pastori?

54:29.588 --> 54:32.258
You shut your fucking face, shithead!

54:32.550 --> 54:35.505
Get down on the ground! Now!

54:36.179 --> 54:37.211
Pinker?

54:39.057 --> 54:43.695
- And let you shoot me like a dog?
- Then eat this, asshole!

55:10.170 --> 55:11.927
Running out of gas, Pinker?

55:12.464 --> 55:14.849
You should've picked a better body,
you gimp.

55:48.834 --> 55:53.579
Jonathan, help me, please.

55:55.089 --> 55:56.122
Pastori?

55:57.550 --> 55:59.424
How did I get out of the hospital?

56:03.056 --> 56:06.069
Jesus, help me.

56:12.189 --> 56:13.851
Feeling yourself, Pastori?

56:18.904 --> 56:20.411
Hey, man, is he all right?

56:20.990 --> 56:25.250
Yeah, he's all right.
He's a little under the weather.

56:36.171 --> 56:38.806
- Oh, mother.
- Come here, kid.

56:40.843 --> 56:42.314
I didn't do anything.

56:47.391 --> 56:48.601
Got you.

57:40.026 --> 57:41.307
Sorry, mister.

57:41.778 --> 57:44.305
It's all right, sweetie,
you just banged my funny bone.

57:44.405 --> 57:46.933
You ought to try being a little
more careful with that thing.

57:47.033 --> 57:49.322
I will. Sorry. Bye.

58:03.382 --> 58:04.415
Excuse me, sir.

58:05.426 --> 58:08.214
Have you seen a little girl, blonde,
on a bicycle?

58:10.222 --> 58:11.373
Sorry.

58:11.473 --> 58:14.855
No, I saw her.
She was up by that light pole up there.

58:15.268 --> 58:18.401
Well, thank you. Amanda!

58:21.733 --> 58:26.692
Help me. Please help me.

58:52.221 --> 58:54.631
Come on, you fucker! Move!

59:09.197 --> 59:10.360
Christ.

59:36.223 --> 59:38.762
Come here, you little... Come here!

59:42.730 --> 59:44.142
Come here!

59:47.609 --> 59:49.365
Get away from my daughter!

59:50.070 --> 59:51.103
Pinker?

59:51.279 --> 59:54.182
I'm gonna rip your lungs out,
you son of a bitch!

59:54.282 --> 59:56.787
Get away from her!

01:00:00.372 --> 01:00:02.163
What the hell are you doing?

01:00:05.710 --> 01:00:06.872
Amanda!

01:00:09.089 --> 01:00:10.335
Amanda!

01:00:12.092 --> 01:00:13.563
Stop, Mandy!

01:00:18.931 --> 01:00:19.965
Come here.

01:00:22.519 --> 01:00:25.023
Get out of her, Pinker.
Get out of her, you bastard!

01:00:31.902 --> 01:00:34.751
Mandy.

01:00:43.163 --> 01:00:46.830
God.

01:01:06.102 --> 01:01:07.894
Is this creep bugging you, ma'am?

01:01:10.482 --> 01:01:11.610
No!

01:01:26.749 --> 01:01:30.889
- No!
- Eat your heart out, sucker.

01:01:42.430 --> 01:01:44.720
How do you like this body, Jonathan?

01:01:59.322 --> 01:02:00.699
I don't get it.

01:02:00.866 --> 01:02:02.851
Are you saying
that Pinker is alive somehow?

01:02:02.951 --> 01:02:06.312
And he just jumps in and out of people
like a goddamn crab or something?

01:02:06.412 --> 01:02:09.757
I know it sounds crazy,
but that's exactly what he's doing.

01:02:09.873 --> 01:02:13.779
Maybe he's using electricity or something
because of the way he died, I don't know.

01:02:13.879 --> 01:02:17.959
All I do know is that
I saw him do it five times today.

01:02:18.174 --> 01:02:21.786
- Let's go just grab the fucker then.
- And break his neck.

01:02:21.886 --> 01:02:25.123
- I'd love to break his neck.
- You can't do it that directly, Rhino...

01:02:25.223 --> 01:02:28.604
or you'd be killing whoever it is
that he's inside of, that's the whole point.

01:02:28.726 --> 01:02:31.420
Then, why don't you just do
like you said you did with this cop?

01:02:31.520 --> 01:02:33.797
I mean, you can outrun anybody
Pinker gets into...

01:02:33.897 --> 01:02:37.066
and then, when they're out of energy
Pinker's just forced out.

01:02:37.693 --> 01:02:41.013
- Then we'll break his neck.
- It doesn't work that way, Coach.

01:02:41.113 --> 01:02:45.100
You don't force him out of the body until
he's used up the life of the body he's in.

01:02:45.200 --> 01:02:48.238
We can't go killing people
just to get Pinker out, you know.

01:02:49.246 --> 01:02:53.197
But there is something we can use,
to get him out before he kills the body.

01:02:53.834 --> 01:02:56.528
Well, what is it?
I mean, I'll get you 10 of them.

01:02:56.628 --> 01:02:59.974
There's only one of them.
It's in the bottom of the lake.

01:03:00.841 --> 01:03:02.348
The bottom of the lake?

01:03:02.677 --> 01:03:05.704
I know pretty much where it is.
I think we can find it.

01:03:05.804 --> 01:03:08.651
I have a diving mask
in my closet at home.

01:03:09.599 --> 01:03:14.108
I just need you to go and get it, Coach.
I can't go back to that house.

01:03:18.066 --> 01:03:20.735
All right, I'll go get your mask.

01:03:21.486 --> 01:03:24.653
- Meet me at the lake in half an hour.
- I'll go with you.

01:03:25.490 --> 01:03:28.836
I'll get you some fresh clothes
and something to eat, too.

01:03:31.663 --> 01:03:33.703
- You guys be careful.
- You be careful.

01:03:33.998 --> 01:03:35.908
I'm not letting you out of my sight.

01:03:59.356 --> 01:04:00.827
Where the hell is he?

01:04:08.282 --> 01:04:11.768
Coach isn't coming. He's out laughing it up
with Pac Man somewhere right now.

01:04:11.868 --> 01:04:13.895
No way Coach'd jerk you around.

01:04:13.995 --> 01:04:17.358
He's an hour and 15 minutes late, Rhino,
an hour and 15.

01:04:17.458 --> 01:04:19.119
Does that sound like Cooper to you?

01:04:19.251 --> 01:04:21.903
I mean, for all I know
the cops are all over my place.

01:04:22.003 --> 01:04:25.385
God knows, enough people saw me
running from Pastori.

01:04:26.424 --> 01:04:29.495
Pinker's gonna start killing
again tonight if I don't stop him.

01:04:29.595 --> 01:04:32.164
I can feel it.
I gotta get that thing, Rhino.

01:04:32.264 --> 01:04:35.217
- I just gotta get it.
- Jon, wait.

01:04:35.600 --> 01:04:39.266
Man, what are you doing?
Jon, wait, hold it. Okay.

01:04:40.815 --> 01:04:43.258
All right, maybe if I go look.
Tell me what it is.

01:04:43.358 --> 01:04:47.119
But you can't see a thing in here,
Rhino, without a mask. No one can.

01:04:47.445 --> 01:04:50.826
- I gotta go back to my place.
- What are you doing?

01:04:51.908 --> 01:04:53.534
I gotta go back to the house.

01:04:54.202 --> 01:04:56.187
You gotta go?
What the hell you talking about?

01:04:56.287 --> 01:04:58.773
- We gotta go. I'm with you on this.
- Get lost, no deal.

01:04:58.873 --> 01:05:01.067
Fuck you, you need a friend.
That's Rhino, that's the deal.

01:05:01.167 --> 01:05:02.293
What are you, God?

01:05:05.130 --> 01:05:07.532
You know what I could do to you
if I wanted to, right?

01:05:07.632 --> 01:05:12.057
But that ain't what I'm about.
What about you? What you about?

01:05:13.470 --> 01:05:15.380
You're not my friend on this, Rhino.

01:05:21.520 --> 01:05:25.281
Look, I already got one person
I love killed, I'm not gonna do that again.

01:05:26.525 --> 01:05:28.031
I gotta do this by myself.

01:05:28.987 --> 01:05:31.395
You wanna be my friend, leave me be.

01:07:08.918 --> 01:07:10.129
Alison?

01:07:14.422 --> 01:07:15.455
Coach.

01:07:15.632 --> 01:07:18.978
Good evening, Jonathan. Alone now?

01:07:20.388 --> 01:07:21.514
What are you doing?

01:07:21.805 --> 01:07:26.385
If someone ever gets in your way, Jonathan,
you gotta run right through them.

01:07:26.977 --> 01:07:28.697
Understand what I'm saying?

01:07:31.356 --> 01:07:36.434
Remember what I told you?
I'm gonna rip your lungs out, Jonathan!

01:07:38.071 --> 01:07:40.147
No more Mr. Nice Guy.

01:08:09.728 --> 01:08:12.088
Coach, please, not you!

01:08:12.188 --> 01:08:14.572
Coach Cooper's bye-bye, asshole.

01:08:15.400 --> 01:08:19.979
And the closet, don't look.
I made a mess on the floor.

01:08:49.308 --> 01:08:51.348
God, no more!

01:08:53.103 --> 01:08:58.026
Pac Man liked you too much, Jonathan.
He wouldn't let me in.

01:08:58.274 --> 01:09:02.429
That's a no-no. Time to die, sweetie!

01:09:02.529 --> 01:09:04.368
Don't even think about it, Pinker.

01:09:08.493 --> 01:09:12.953
Cooper, for your own sake, fight him.

01:09:13.624 --> 01:09:15.783
Don't let him take your soul.

01:09:16.917 --> 01:09:18.259
It's like you say, Coach!

01:09:18.711 --> 01:09:22.591
Coach, it's like you say,
I know you're in there!

01:09:23.381 --> 01:09:25.602
Everything is a matter of will.

01:09:27.929 --> 01:09:31.559
Will him out.

01:09:34.769 --> 01:09:39.314
Jonathan, he's too strong.
I can't will him out.

01:09:39.814 --> 01:09:41.026
Yes, you can.

01:09:44.528 --> 01:09:48.740
I can eat this wimp's will power
for breakfast, Jon-bo!

01:09:49.576 --> 01:09:50.702
No.

01:09:53.162 --> 01:09:57.232
I want to tell you, Jonathan,
to get this bastard!

01:09:57.332 --> 01:10:01.034
- Coach.
- No!

01:10:02.463 --> 01:10:05.096
No, Coach! No!

01:10:23.525 --> 01:10:27.156
No!

01:10:33.243 --> 01:10:37.982
Get out of my way, bitch. I need a body.

01:10:38.082 --> 01:10:40.621
Go back to hell
where you belong, Pinker.

01:11:19.955 --> 01:11:23.752
Jonathan. Jon.

01:11:29.674 --> 01:11:30.765
Jonathan.

01:11:32.926 --> 01:11:36.130
I have something
very important to tell you.

01:11:36.888 --> 01:11:39.023
Listen very carefully.

01:11:43.562 --> 01:11:44.903
Wait a minute.

01:11:47.774 --> 01:11:49.565
There's a little power.

01:11:55.782 --> 01:11:57.858
- Why not?
- Jonathan?

01:12:03.707 --> 01:12:07.658
I think I can.

01:12:13.466 --> 01:12:14.499
Damn!

01:12:20.432 --> 01:12:21.974
Contact!

01:12:23.018 --> 01:12:25.153
Jon, what's going on in there?

01:12:30.400 --> 01:12:33.069
Jonathan, open up.

01:12:37.824 --> 01:12:38.855
Jonathan.

01:12:49.501 --> 01:12:51.826
It smells like
the goddamn electric chair in here.

01:13:01.805 --> 01:13:02.897
Don.

01:13:33.254 --> 01:13:34.534
- Hold it!
- Oh, jeez, you scared...

01:13:37.466 --> 01:13:41.167
- What the hell's going on around here?
- It's been a bad day, Don.

01:13:42.511 --> 01:13:43.759
You'd never believe me.

01:13:44.556 --> 01:13:47.250
It may interest you to know
there's an APB out on you.

01:13:47.350 --> 01:13:50.388
Half a dozen people witnessed Pastori
chasing you in the park.

01:13:51.395 --> 01:13:52.772
He's dead now, too.

01:13:53.397 --> 01:13:56.685
Yeah, well, what the hell was Pastori
doing out of the hospital...

01:13:57.360 --> 01:13:58.571
wearing his uniform?

01:13:59.821 --> 01:14:01.103
What have you been up to?

01:14:03.324 --> 01:14:07.275
I wanted Pinker dead so bad,
when I got my wish...

01:14:08.037 --> 01:14:09.450
it just made him stronger.

01:14:11.374 --> 01:14:12.785
You think I killed that cop.

01:14:13.960 --> 01:14:15.903
You're talking crazy enough,
that's for sure.

01:14:16.003 --> 01:14:18.258
If you did,
you must've scared him to death.

01:14:18.588 --> 01:14:19.680
What do you mean?

01:14:20.967 --> 01:14:24.976
I mean, there wasn't a mark on him.
He was just dead.

01:14:38.233 --> 01:14:39.858
You're family a long time, Jonathan.

01:14:41.779 --> 01:14:43.320
Been through a lot of tough times.

01:14:44.447 --> 01:14:47.865
I saw you turn a screwed up childhood
into straight A's.

01:14:48.869 --> 01:14:52.132
Football scholarship.
I've been proud to be your father.

01:14:54.124 --> 01:14:56.663
I can't see you a killer.

01:14:59.796 --> 01:15:01.671
Besides, Pastori's body was just a...

01:15:04.050 --> 01:15:06.720
- A husk, just like...
- Just like Pinker's.

01:15:14.602 --> 01:15:15.944
Shit.

01:15:44.465 --> 01:15:46.434
Is that how you knew
about Bobby's fingers?

01:15:49.137 --> 01:15:50.228
I gotta take you in, kid.

01:15:52.306 --> 01:15:53.777
Don't do that, Don.

01:16:03.150 --> 01:16:05.260
Called for backup
when I heard the fighting in here.

01:16:05.360 --> 01:16:06.393
What do you want?

01:16:07.237 --> 01:16:09.314
- Read him his rights.
- Yes, sir.

01:16:10.240 --> 01:16:12.780
Jonathan, you're under arrest.

01:16:14.161 --> 01:16:15.822
"You have the right to remain silent.

01:16:16.955 --> 01:16:18.941
"Give up the right to remain silent...

01:16:19.041 --> 01:16:21.401
"anything you say
can and will be used against you."

01:16:21.501 --> 01:16:22.533
Shit!

01:16:23.169 --> 01:16:25.246
What is it with the electricity
around here?

01:16:28.008 --> 01:16:31.519
- Put him in my car, I'll take him back myself.
- Yes, sir.

01:16:35.890 --> 01:16:38.929
"You have the right to have
an attorney present during questioning.

01:16:40.312 --> 01:16:42.172
"If you so desire
and cannot afford one...

01:16:42.272 --> 01:16:43.923
"one will be appointed to you
without charge."

01:16:44.023 --> 01:16:46.063
Do you understand these rights
as I've read them to you?

01:16:46.400 --> 01:16:49.119
Sure as shit can't tell
a book by its cover, huh, boys?

01:16:57.495 --> 01:17:00.248
All right, boys, wrap it up.
I got something to do here.

01:17:03.585 --> 01:17:05.910
- Check that car.
- Yes, sir.

01:17:06.129 --> 01:17:09.391
- Hey, Smitty, you got a key for this thing?
- Yeah, inside.

01:17:19.100 --> 01:17:23.462
No. Shit!

01:17:23.562 --> 01:17:27.074
Move. Come on, Jon, get on your feet.
Let's move! Move, boy.

01:17:27.191 --> 01:17:29.267
Come on. Go! Explain later, go!

01:17:31.403 --> 01:17:33.123
Jesus!

01:17:36.659 --> 01:17:38.019
- Freeze!
- Shit!

01:17:38.119 --> 01:17:39.151
Get him!

01:17:39.328 --> 01:17:43.338
No, I'll get him! This one's mine!

01:18:16.406 --> 01:18:19.502
Don! Can't we just talk about this?

01:18:21.244 --> 01:18:22.276
Guess not.

01:18:32.713 --> 01:18:37.542
- Don, you gotta fight him.
- Eat shit and die, you little fuck.

01:18:38.469 --> 01:18:39.501
That's nice.

01:19:26.057 --> 01:19:27.647
Dead end, asshole.

01:19:43.492 --> 01:19:44.583
Motherfucker.

01:19:49.330 --> 01:19:52.842
Hey, kid, eat this.

01:20:15.314 --> 01:20:16.347
Come on.

01:20:25.574 --> 01:20:27.330
Where you gonna go now?

01:20:41.757 --> 01:20:45.536
Don, you gotta fight him.
You can't let him do this to you.

01:20:45.636 --> 01:20:48.455
You gotta get him out!
Don't let him do this, Donnie!

01:20:48.555 --> 01:20:53.300
Don't let him do this!
You gotta stop it! Stop him!

01:21:04.821 --> 01:21:05.983
What's going on?

01:21:08.199 --> 01:21:10.205
Don, are you there?

01:21:10.911 --> 01:21:13.663
- Talk to me.
- Oh, God.

01:21:14.872 --> 01:21:16.498
Jonathan, I'm so sorry.

01:21:18.542 --> 01:21:19.575
I'm so sorry.

01:21:38.396 --> 01:21:39.985
My heart. I...

01:21:52.034 --> 01:21:53.576
Jonathan, help me!

01:22:04.338 --> 01:22:09.048
All right, asshole, I'm nationwide now.

01:22:33.950 --> 01:22:38.126
Donnie, give me your hand.

01:22:38.246 --> 01:22:39.907
Donnie, give me your hand!

01:22:48.339 --> 01:22:50.973
I got you. Okay.

01:23:05.272 --> 01:23:07.562
Donnie, I never even knew
you had a bad heart.

01:23:08.734 --> 01:23:09.766
I don't.

01:23:13.114 --> 01:23:17.623
I knew that. You knew that...

01:23:19.870 --> 01:23:21.116
but Pinker didn't.

01:23:27.545 --> 01:23:30.697
With the arrest of Jonathan Parker
who was increasingly implicated...

01:23:30.797 --> 01:23:34.159
in the copy-cat murders following
the electrocution of Horace Pinker...

01:23:34.259 --> 01:23:35.849
the horrors seemed to be over.

01:23:36.261 --> 01:23:38.914
But last night, while Jonathan Parker
was in the city jail...

01:23:39.014 --> 01:23:41.249
the copy-cat murderer struck again...

01:23:41.349 --> 01:23:44.586
killing an entire Maryville family
and leaving a grizzly threat...

01:23:44.686 --> 01:23:49.231
to Jonathan Parker scrawled on the wall,
signing the name Horace Pinker.

01:23:49.609 --> 01:23:53.274
Police are further baffled
because there were no signs of forced entry.

01:23:53.445 --> 01:23:58.249
The family apparently awake and
watching TV at the time the killer struck.

01:23:58.533 --> 01:24:01.488
Meanwhile, Jonathan Parker
has been released by authorities...

01:24:02.704 --> 01:24:05.457
following the testimony of his father,
Police Lt. Donald Parker.

01:24:05.582 --> 01:24:09.277
Indeed, police lab reports confirm
that the deaths of Coach Sydney Cooper...

01:24:09.377 --> 01:24:12.225
and Student Assistant Coach
Roy "Pac Man" Stewart...

01:24:12.338 --> 01:24:14.914
now appear to be
the results of a murder-suicide.

01:24:16.551 --> 01:24:18.876
Coach didn't do it, you guys,
neither did Pac Man.

01:24:19.971 --> 01:24:21.134
You still up for this?

01:24:28.271 --> 01:24:31.439
- We're friends, right?
- Yeah, we're friends.

01:24:33.818 --> 01:24:35.728
- And we're a team, right?
- Right!

01:24:37.321 --> 01:24:39.457
So we'll do what you ask us to do.

01:24:40.659 --> 01:24:44.455
Just make sure you do it exactly
at midnight. Give me enough time, okay?

01:24:44.954 --> 01:24:46.045
Right.

01:24:46.831 --> 01:24:49.120
- All right, let's go!
- All right. Come on. Let's do it.

01:25:08.518 --> 01:25:10.677
Come on, 17 minutes and counting.

01:25:11.187 --> 01:25:13.673
- This is crazy.
- Sometimes crazy is what it takes.

01:25:13.773 --> 01:25:17.120
Shut up and get in there. Let's go.

01:25:23.033 --> 01:25:24.065
Come on.

01:25:35.337 --> 01:25:36.446
- You all set?
- Yeah.

01:25:36.546 --> 01:25:37.638
Let's go.

01:25:44.680 --> 01:25:47.253
The stuff's all set up and ready,
just like you asked for.

01:25:51.936 --> 01:25:53.562
Okay, let me get this straight.

01:25:54.064 --> 01:25:56.883
You want me to go on the air live
at five minutes to midnight...

01:25:56.983 --> 01:25:59.760
and if I do, you guarantee
you'll deliver the guy...

01:25:59.860 --> 01:26:02.150
responsible for the copy-cat killings
last night?

01:26:02.529 --> 01:26:03.562
That's right.

01:26:07.202 --> 01:26:11.745
- Don't make a fool out of me, live.
- I'm gonna make you a network anchorman.

01:26:13.040 --> 01:26:14.630
You're ready for that, aren't you?

01:26:18.463 --> 01:26:19.590
Where're you going?

01:26:20.214 --> 01:26:22.659
I'm gonna go get the killer for you,
bring him right here.

01:26:22.759 --> 01:26:25.285
All you have to do is make sure
this camera's on...

01:26:25.385 --> 01:26:27.454
feeding the station by five to midnight.

01:26:27.554 --> 01:26:30.058
No way I'm doing what you tell me,
with you not here.

01:26:30.766 --> 01:26:31.798
Really?

01:26:31.934 --> 01:26:35.636
Well, we'll just let the other networks
get the story first, I don't care.

01:26:39.942 --> 01:26:42.102
- Do you want us to pack back up?
- No, leave it.

01:26:44.947 --> 01:26:46.857
I have a feeling this kid's for real.

01:26:50.118 --> 01:26:51.874
I wish Pac Man were here for this.

01:26:54.498 --> 01:26:55.530
A maze.

01:26:59.044 --> 01:27:00.206
There it is.

01:27:04.215 --> 01:27:06.006
The central unit should be in there.

01:27:10.680 --> 01:27:13.943
- Too bad it's locked. Let's get out of here.
- Pick it.

01:27:14.350 --> 01:27:16.569
- That's a felony.
- No, that's a lock, pick it.

01:27:24.985 --> 01:27:26.232
Come on.

01:29:04.292 --> 01:29:09.120
Please!

01:29:10.632 --> 01:29:11.758
Jonathan.

01:29:23.478 --> 01:29:24.818
Jonathan.

01:29:49.836 --> 01:29:53.716
The red-crested nuthatch is one of
the largest arboreals found in the British...

01:30:24.871 --> 01:30:28.775
- Don't be afraid, Jonathan.
- You're not alive, Alison.

01:30:28.875 --> 01:30:30.121
So? I'm here.

01:31:04.160 --> 01:31:05.405
All right.

01:31:10.499 --> 01:31:11.661
That's it.

01:31:14.170 --> 01:31:16.305
- Give me the crowbar.
- Crowbar.

01:31:16.797 --> 01:31:18.767
- Mask.
- Mask.

01:31:21.843 --> 01:31:24.560
All right, move it. Get back.

01:31:43.114 --> 01:31:44.147
Jonathan.

01:31:46.910 --> 01:31:50.326
Jonathan, stop sleeping.

01:31:51.165 --> 01:31:53.952
- Please.
- Wake up, Jonathan.

01:31:55.126 --> 01:31:58.673
- Don't let him catch you sleeping.
- Watch your ass, boy.

01:31:59.589 --> 01:32:00.965
Don't get caught napping.

01:32:01.632 --> 01:32:04.828
I don't wanna go through with this.
Why should I go back?

01:32:04.928 --> 01:32:07.253
Why should I be away from you
in that madness?

01:32:07.764 --> 01:32:09.769
You've got to, Jonathan, or you'll die.

01:32:10.266 --> 01:32:13.611
Then I die. I don't ever wanna
be away from you again.

01:32:14.645 --> 01:32:17.659
You'll never be apart
from me again, ever.

01:32:21.860 --> 01:32:25.490
$5,000, praise the Lord, for a total...

01:32:25.655 --> 01:32:30.794
a grand total of $1,542,000.79...

01:32:31.621 --> 01:32:34.857
But glory be, we hear you, Lord.

01:32:34.957 --> 01:32:38.966
The Lord wants more.
We still need more cash for Christ.

01:32:39.419 --> 01:32:42.115
Let it rain,
let it rain dollars for Christ.

01:32:42.215 --> 01:32:45.251
More.

01:32:45.467 --> 01:32:49.477
And the beast shall rise out of the pit
and walk among the world...

01:32:49.888 --> 01:32:53.685
and great will be the devastation
and desolation.

01:32:54.226 --> 01:32:58.366
And I tell you woe to the man
who is without the Lord.

01:32:58.814 --> 01:33:01.317
And woe to the man
and woe to the woman...

01:33:01.691 --> 01:33:04.953
who has not given generously
to this ministry.

01:33:05.362 --> 01:33:08.648
Who has not dug deep and sent cash...

01:33:08.990 --> 01:33:13.728
or check to this anti-beast brigade...

01:33:13.828 --> 01:33:17.874
of true believers
who are girding now for battle.

01:33:18.083 --> 01:33:21.998
I beg you, send your dollars
to Jesus now!

01:33:24.714 --> 01:33:28.059
Beware! Beware of the beast!

01:33:28.509 --> 01:33:31.144
He's among you! Prepare!

01:33:31.388 --> 01:33:35.564
Check your perimeter!

01:33:55.870 --> 01:33:56.902
Die!

01:34:13.095 --> 01:34:16.013
This Barcalounger's gonna
kick your ass, boy.

01:34:29.902 --> 01:34:32.537
It's hard to outrun
Reddy Kilowatt, asshole.

01:34:45.419 --> 01:34:49.823
In the last 80 years alone, over 125 million
people have been killed...

01:34:49.923 --> 01:34:52.200
in warfare between civilized nations.

01:34:52.300 --> 01:34:55.645
This total is the equivalent
of murdering the entire population...

01:35:06.981 --> 01:35:10.113
Come on, boy,
let's take a ride in my Voltswagen.

01:35:43.933 --> 01:35:47.565
Alison, if you're in me,
give me the power to do this.

01:36:05.037 --> 01:36:06.070
Bastard!

01:36:10.334 --> 01:36:11.676
Who the hell's that guy?

01:36:12.337 --> 01:36:13.962
Take cover!

01:36:14.547 --> 01:36:17.015
Do as your father asks.
Roll up the window.

01:36:18.050 --> 01:36:21.162
Hey, Beaver!

01:36:21.262 --> 01:36:23.517
Well, it's all out in the open now.

01:36:35.233 --> 01:36:38.581
So we still have no word
from our reporter at the home of Lt. Parker.

01:36:38.696 --> 01:36:42.391
However, incredibly, we have begun
to receive unconfirmed reports...

01:36:42.491 --> 01:36:45.811
of unexplained appearances
of Jonathan Parker...

01:36:45.911 --> 01:36:49.791
and a man who looks very much like
executed mass murderer Horace Pinker...

01:36:50.166 --> 01:36:53.695
- fighting at least what appears to be...
- Kick his ass!

01:36:53.795 --> 01:36:57.306
...the programming of several local stations
during the last several minutes.

01:37:01.302 --> 01:37:02.464
And that's the way it is.

01:37:04.971 --> 01:37:06.064
Did you get that?

01:37:10.769 --> 01:37:13.308
My kind of town!

01:37:13.480 --> 01:37:14.513
Move it out.

01:37:23.281 --> 01:37:26.069
- Come here, you shit!
- Dial 911!

01:37:59.150 --> 01:38:00.739
We got any cheese spread?

01:38:03.029 --> 01:38:04.998
Now wait a minute, that's my drink.

01:38:07.199 --> 01:38:10.019
- Honey.
- Do we have any cheese spread, or what?

01:38:10.119 --> 01:38:12.396
Come on!

01:38:12.496 --> 01:38:13.837
Get him, honey.

01:38:19.087 --> 01:38:20.557
Now watch out.

01:38:22.548 --> 01:38:23.579
Now wait a minute.

01:38:25.050 --> 01:38:28.752
I've heard of audience participation shows,
but this is ridiculous.

01:38:29.013 --> 01:38:30.080
Give me that!

01:38:30.180 --> 01:38:31.213
You can't take that.

01:38:32.474 --> 01:38:34.479
He's taking our remote.

01:38:38.021 --> 01:38:39.054
Sweet Jesus!

01:38:45.612 --> 01:38:46.645
Shut up!

01:38:48.782 --> 01:38:49.808
Come here.

01:38:49.908 --> 01:38:51.913
Brother, are you all right?

01:38:56.122 --> 01:38:57.155
Get up, you shit!

01:39:12.097 --> 01:39:14.765
Holy shit! It's him! Horace Pinker.

01:39:22.231 --> 01:39:24.450
What are you staring at?
Get the camera on him!

01:39:30.114 --> 01:39:33.247
A special bulletin?
I'll give you a show!

01:39:34.577 --> 01:39:35.669
Let's get out of here!

01:39:46.339 --> 01:39:49.091
I killed your mama
and your little sister here.

01:39:49.967 --> 01:39:53.799
Right about there.
I'll do you here, too.

01:39:57.558 --> 01:39:59.527
Say your prayers, squirt.

01:40:00.227 --> 01:40:02.980
I'm gonna do you real slow.

01:40:15.992 --> 01:40:19.030
Hey, what the fuck?

01:40:27.004 --> 01:40:28.035
It's show time.

01:40:35.095 --> 01:40:37.314
What the hell are you doing?

01:40:37.681 --> 01:40:42.224
You bought into TV, Pinker,
now you're bound by its rules.

01:40:44.312 --> 01:40:47.444
I'm gonna show you something.
Remember Bobby, my little brother?

01:40:50.609 --> 01:40:54.240
My mother? My baby sister?

01:40:58.827 --> 01:41:01.780
Let's try and remember
all the other families, Horace.

01:41:01.912 --> 01:41:06.990
Fathers, mothers,
sleeping defenceless in their beds.

01:41:08.670 --> 01:41:13.000
Try. Try to remember the pain. No?

01:41:13.924 --> 01:41:17.507
Then get up on the bed. Up!

01:41:17.678 --> 01:41:21.131
- God damn you little bastard... Stop it!
- Just freeze.

01:41:22.392 --> 01:41:25.179
- That's good.
- And what the fuck?

01:41:27.562 --> 01:41:29.852
I just showed you
what you can never remember.

01:41:30.232 --> 01:41:32.635
What it feels like to victimized.

01:41:32.735 --> 01:41:35.309
Give me a violin, why don't you?

01:41:36.113 --> 01:41:39.494
At the mercy of some guy's hate. Weapon?

01:41:41.159 --> 01:41:45.455
- Doesn't feel so good, does it?
- Go ahead, do it.

01:41:46.373 --> 01:41:49.042
You know you wanna do it.
Go ahead, you little pussy, do it.

01:41:54.005 --> 01:41:57.518
- It's not my style.
- It is your style.

01:41:57.843 --> 01:42:00.762
You're a chip off the old block,
like it or not.

01:42:00.887 --> 01:42:02.872
No good, Pinker,
Alison told me the secret.

01:42:02.972 --> 01:42:05.689
Maybe you were my father,
but you know who my father is now?

01:42:06.184 --> 01:42:09.295
Know who's responsible for me?
Me, no one else.

01:42:09.395 --> 01:42:12.148
I get down from here
and you're dog meat.

01:42:12.315 --> 01:42:16.574
Three minutes to midnight, Pinker.
Rhino blows the Maryville Power Station...

01:42:16.861 --> 01:42:17.970
we'll see who's dog meat.

01:42:18.070 --> 01:42:20.848
Town power goes, TV goes...

01:42:20.948 --> 01:42:23.962
and anybody in this TV room's
gonna go right with it.

01:42:24.619 --> 01:42:28.166
Anybody who gets out first
might just survive.

01:42:28.872 --> 01:42:31.506
Wait a minute,
it was three minutes before.

01:42:31.792 --> 01:42:36.622
Your watch has taken a licking.
And I don't think it's ticking no more.

01:42:39.800 --> 01:42:41.660
Rhino, no!

01:42:41.760 --> 01:42:42.793
One, two...

01:42:54.314 --> 01:42:56.853
You should've killed me
when you had the chance, prick.

01:43:06.868 --> 01:43:09.621
Shit. It's working!

01:43:22.967 --> 01:43:24.000
Shit!

01:43:39.818 --> 01:43:42.701
- It's sign off time.
- No!

01:44:07.303 --> 01:44:09.972
No!

01:44:35.330 --> 01:44:39.590
You bastard, come back in here.
Come back in here, you shit!

01:44:39.793 --> 01:44:44.183
Don't ever turn the TV on, boy,
I'll be there. I'll be there waiting for you.

01:44:44.298 --> 01:44:46.826
I'll look over your shoulder,
you little bastard.

01:44:46.926 --> 01:44:52.135
Come back in here! Come back!

01:45:00.646 --> 01:45:02.902
Bob, you got any lights in your place?

01:45:03.233 --> 01:45:04.953
Looks like the power's out all over.

01:45:05.903 --> 01:45:07.907
- Beautiful.
- Look at that sky.

01:45:08.404 --> 01:45:10.279
- Look at that.
- Isn't it beautiful?

01:45:12.617 --> 01:45:14.338
Jon, I just saw you on the tube.

01:45:14.744 --> 01:45:17.758
- Was that real?
- Yeah, it was real enough.

01:45:20.750 --> 01:45:21.817
Howard?

01:45:21.917 --> 01:45:23.792
Wow, what a storm that was.

01:45:25.129 --> 01:45:26.600
And look at that sky.

01:45:30.718 --> 01:45:32.557
Are you there, you see those stars?

01:45:33.012 --> 01:45:36.428
- Absolutely beautiful.
- It sure is.
