WEBVTT

00:03.870 --> 00:04.990
I’ve used from time to time.

00:04.990 --> 00:07.000
His sense of smell
outpaces even my own.

00:07.090 --> 00:09.290
Sherlock Holmes,
meet Sir James Walter,

00:09.290 --> 00:10.920
deputy chief S.I.S.

00:10.920 --> 00:12.710
I anticipated
that without Moriarty

00:12.710 --> 00:14.290
her group would fall apart.

00:14.290 --> 00:15.460
Someone else has taken over.

00:15.460 --> 00:17.800
I did it for you, Sherlock.

00:17.800 --> 00:19.300
You and Joan.
So your only recourse

00:19.300 --> 00:21.710
was to become head
of an organization

00:21.710 --> 00:23.290
which murders for profit.

00:23.290 --> 00:25.170
How else would I dismantle it?

00:25.170 --> 00:27.050
Your name is Vanja Borozan.

00:27.050 --> 00:29.130
You are a high-priced
assassin.

00:29.130 --> 00:30.670
Who hired you to kill my father?

00:30.670 --> 00:33.050
I understand
that her FBI handlers

00:33.050 --> 00:35.290
lost track of her some time ago.

00:35.290 --> 00:36.460
She’s back, son,

00:36.460 --> 00:39.290
and she wants what’s hers.

00:40.050 --> 00:41.630
Moriarty.

00:43.290 --> 00:45.130
(siren whoops)

00:45.130 --> 00:47.460
(indistinct chatter)

00:59.290 --> 01:00.960
Hey.

01:00.960 --> 01:01.340
Just you?

01:01.340 --> 01:02.920
Yeah. I got your message
while I was out.

01:02.920 --> 01:05.290
I actually thought that Sherlock
would get here before me.

01:05.290 --> 01:06.670
Don’t get me wrong.
No one I’d

01:06.670 --> 01:09.090
rather linger over
a two-day-old corpse with.

01:09.090 --> 01:10.290
WATSON:
Two days?

01:10.290 --> 01:11.340
Neighbors noticed the pizza

01:11.340 --> 01:13.300
had been sitting there a while,
got concerned.

01:13.300 --> 01:16.290
MLI says he’s been dead
about 48 hours.

01:16.290 --> 01:18.090
Victim’s name
was Gilbert Pham.

01:18.090 --> 01:20.290
He’s a lawyer
at Kress & Howell,

01:20.290 --> 01:21.840
one of the big accounting firms.

01:21.840 --> 01:22.710
"VP, Discovery."

01:22.710 --> 01:24.090
Yeah, they go over the books

01:24.090 --> 01:25.920
of companies
involved in deals,

01:25.920 --> 01:28.050
vet mergers,
things like that.

01:28.050 --> 01:30.130
Talked to the
pizza shop.

01:30.130 --> 01:31.290
Cashier says Pham was a regular,

01:31.290 --> 01:33.800
and it was definitely him
who placed the order.

01:33.800 --> 01:36.290
That was 9:00 p.m.
night before last,

01:36.290 --> 01:38.670
so we know he
was still alive then.

01:38.670 --> 01:39.880
Home invasion gone bad?

01:39.880 --> 01:42.550
I’d say that’s what we’re
supposed to think.

01:42.550 --> 01:45.750
Kitchen door window’s busted
from the outside.

01:45.750 --> 01:47.750
We found the bolt
unlocked.

01:47.750 --> 01:48.380
Place has been tossed.

01:48.380 --> 01:49.840
No money or loose valuables
left behind.

01:49.840 --> 01:54.290
But if someone broke that window
and then opened this door,

01:54.290 --> 01:56.550
the door would have
swept the glass aside,

01:56.550 --> 01:57.840
so this was done for show.

01:57.840 --> 02:00.420
We also found
a car service voucher

02:00.420 --> 02:01.460
in Pham’s pocket.

02:01.460 --> 02:02.670
Says they dropped him
here at 7:00.

02:02.670 --> 02:05.130
That’s two hours
before he ordered the pizza.

02:05.130 --> 02:07.050
I don’t know about you
and your partner,

02:07.050 --> 02:09.500
but when I get home,
shoes and tie come off

02:09.500 --> 02:10.710
as soon as I’m in the door.

02:10.710 --> 02:12.380
So you’re wondering
what happened in the two hours

02:12.380 --> 02:15.290
between when he got home
and when he was killed.

02:17.090 --> 02:19.210
Did you notice these scratches?

02:19.210 --> 02:21.290
I saw those bruises
on his wrist.

02:21.290 --> 02:23.630
I’m guessing that he
spent some of that time

02:23.630 --> 02:25.250
handcuffed to this chair.

02:25.250 --> 02:25.960
Could be this whole

02:25.960 --> 02:28.840
"home invasion" angle
was just a distraction

02:28.840 --> 02:30.290
to keep us from looking
at his computer.

02:30.290 --> 02:33.170
I’ll have CCS go over it,
find out what kind of work

02:33.170 --> 02:35.750
he did on it the night he died.
All right.

02:35.750 --> 02:38.590
I’ll call Sherlock again.

02:42.250 --> 02:45.000
(buzzing)

02:50.090 --> 02:51.840
You can’t be certain
that it was Moriarty

02:51.840 --> 02:54.000
who hired Vanja Borozan
to kill you.

02:54.000 --> 02:55.630
Plenty of people
want you dead.

02:55.630 --> 02:58.170
Most of my life,
I’ve wanted you dead.

02:58.170 --> 02:58.800
No doubt.

02:58.800 --> 03:00.880
But even you must
be able to see

03:00.880 --> 03:02.130
the sense in what I say.

03:02.130 --> 03:04.000
Borozan trained
in Moriarty’s camp.

03:04.000 --> 03:06.590
I’ve made it my mission
for the last two years

03:06.590 --> 03:08.000
to destroy her empire.

03:08.000 --> 03:09.050
That she should
eventually

03:09.050 --> 03:10.290
turn her attention to me
was inevitable.

03:10.290 --> 03:13.050
So, did every last one of her
handlers die during her escape?

03:13.050 --> 03:14.750
’Cause you’d think someone
would have notified me.

03:14.750 --> 03:18.250
As I understand it, she simply
slipped through their fingers.

03:18.250 --> 03:19.090
No bloodshed.

03:19.090 --> 03:21.920
Makes one think she could
have done it at any time.

03:21.920 --> 03:25.340
I wouldn’t be too harsh
on your FBI contacts.

03:25.340 --> 03:28.960
The Bureau tried very hard
to keep a lid on it.

03:28.960 --> 03:32.000
Losing a prisoner as important
as Moriarty, well...

03:32.000 --> 03:33.380
must be quite
an embarrassment.

03:33.380 --> 03:35.550
What’s your excuse
for not telling me?

03:35.550 --> 03:37.170
I haven’t known for long.

03:37.170 --> 03:40.290
I will, of course,
need to verify all of this.

03:40.290 --> 03:41.960
Of course.

03:41.960 --> 03:45.460
Once you have,
I’ll need your help.

03:45.960 --> 03:48.170
I hoped I would never
have to make this request.

03:48.170 --> 03:50.290
We can both imagine
how many lives would be lost

03:50.290 --> 03:52.960
should she ascend
to her former power.

03:52.960 --> 03:55.050
And no one knows her
better than you.

03:55.050 --> 03:56.290
What’s the request?

03:56.290 --> 03:59.210
Moriarty intends to kill me.

03:59.800 --> 04:03.960
I need your help
to kill her first.

SIR WALTER:
You’ve been asking
a lot of favors

04:56.800 --> 04:58.750
of us lately, Holmes.

04:58.750 --> 05:01.250
My time working
for British Intelligence

05:01.250 --> 05:02.340
may have been brief,

05:02.340 --> 05:04.790
but I’d say I’d earned
a few chits.

05:04.790 --> 05:06.090
Indeed.

05:06.090 --> 05:07.130
Per your request,

05:07.130 --> 05:10.590
the personal effects
of Vanja Borozan.

05:10.590 --> 05:12.500
Everything we
found on his body

05:12.500 --> 05:14.000
or in his hotel room.

05:14.000 --> 05:17.340
So far, our boys have
failed to identify

05:17.340 --> 05:18.710
whoever was
paying his bills,

05:18.710 --> 05:22.550
but I would not be surprised
if you have greater success.

05:22.550 --> 05:25.420
I’ll let you know what I find.

05:28.460 --> 05:29.790
Holmes.

05:29.790 --> 05:31.210
The last time we met,

05:31.210 --> 05:32.460
I expressed my
condolences

05:32.460 --> 05:33.790
on the death of
your brother.

05:33.790 --> 05:35.380
But that time,
they were

05:35.380 --> 05:39.750
empty words, as you and I
both knew that he was alive.

05:40.630 --> 05:43.750
I am sorry for your loss.

05:48.750 --> 05:51.790
MAN:To Washburn Tobacco

05:51.790 --> 05:53.750
and Summit-Stow Distributors.

05:53.750 --> 05:55.170
(indistinct chatter)

05:55.170 --> 05:56.090
Congratulations, Kip.

05:56.090 --> 05:59.170
You’re about to be
a wealthy man.

05:59.170 --> 06:01.630
(chuckling)

06:03.420 --> 06:05.750
BELL:
Sorry to interrupt.

06:05.750 --> 06:07.300
We’re looking
for Aldo Ventura.

06:07.300 --> 06:09.130
That would be me.

06:09.130 --> 06:11.000
Is there a problem, Officer?

06:11.000 --> 06:12.920
Detective, actually--
Marcus Bell.

06:12.920 --> 06:14.590
And I wouldn’t sign
those contracts

06:14.590 --> 06:16.670
if I were you.
We’re pretty sure

06:16.670 --> 06:19.300
your discovery lawyer
gave this merger his blessing

06:19.300 --> 06:21.340
with a gun to his head.

06:24.420 --> 06:28.130
BELL:
Summit-Stow Distributors
is a tobacco wholesaler.

06:28.130 --> 06:29.670
Is that right, Mr. Lowell?

06:29.670 --> 06:31.630
So you buy cigarettes
from the big companies

06:31.630 --> 06:32.790
and sell them
to retailers.

06:32.790 --> 06:34.790
Only now you’re about to become

06:34.790 --> 06:35.920
part of a big company.

06:35.920 --> 06:37.790
That’s right.

06:37.790 --> 06:38.880
(groans quietly)

06:38.880 --> 06:40.790
Are you all right, Mr. Lowell?

06:40.790 --> 06:41.790
Yeah. I’m sorry.

06:41.790 --> 06:44.790
I, uh... I took a
couple of lorazepam

06:44.790 --> 06:46.880
for the flight
in from Ohio.

06:46.880 --> 06:47.790
For antianxiety.

06:47.790 --> 06:49.960
Also, I drank some
champagne, so...

06:49.960 --> 06:51.790
Should you be signing contracts
in your condition?

06:51.790 --> 06:54.630
We’ve already read them.
They’re very good for us.

06:54.630 --> 06:55.790
LOWELL: Think what
I just don’t get

06:55.790 --> 06:59.170
is why you think one of us
killed Gilbert Pham.

06:59.170 --> 07:00.790
So you knew Mr. Pham?

07:00.790 --> 07:01.790
Yeah, we spoke.

07:01.790 --> 07:03.790
He worked at the
accounting firm

07:03.790 --> 07:05.790
that Washburn hired to
go over our financials.

07:05.790 --> 07:08.790
Mr. Pham logged into
his firm’s network from home

07:08.790 --> 07:09.790
the night he was killed.

07:09.790 --> 07:12.790
He filed a report that gave
this merger his sign-off.

07:12.790 --> 07:15.210
WATSON: And since Pham
was hired by Washburn

07:15.210 --> 07:16.800
to vet the deal, it seems likely

07:16.800 --> 07:19.000
there was some bad news
in your books

07:19.000 --> 07:20.710
that one of you
was worried about.

07:20.710 --> 07:23.050
So you forced Pham to give
the okay, and then killed him.

07:23.050 --> 07:27.380
You’re looking at the only four
employees at Summit-Stow

07:27.380 --> 07:29.790
with any financial stake
in this merger.

07:29.790 --> 07:32.340
And we all flew in
together this morning.

07:32.340 --> 07:33.840
LOWELL:
I can personally vouch

07:33.840 --> 07:36.790
that we were all in
Akron three nights ago.

07:36.790 --> 07:38.420
BELL:
We’re listening.

07:38.420 --> 07:39.750
This is a murder investigation.

07:39.750 --> 07:42.790
We don’t take alibis
at people’s word.

07:43.880 --> 07:45.460
You seem unimpaired.

07:45.460 --> 07:46.920
Who are you?

07:47.460 --> 07:48.790
Name’s Tim Darsha.

07:48.790 --> 07:50.790
LOWELL:
Tim’s one of

07:50.790 --> 07:51.750
our sales managers.

07:51.750 --> 07:52.800
Lamar over there
is the other.

07:52.800 --> 07:54.250
And you’re the president
of the company,

07:54.250 --> 07:57.250
so why did you look to him
for permission to speak?

07:57.250 --> 07:58.460
(chuckles softly)

07:58.460 --> 07:59.750
I didn’t.

07:59.750 --> 08:00.550
He didn’t.

08:00.550 --> 08:03.420
Sorry. You were saying?
Your alibi.

08:03.790 --> 08:05.710
We’d heard
from Washburn that Pham

08:05.710 --> 08:07.790
had signed off and
that our deal would be

08:07.790 --> 08:09.790
finalized soon,
so we started celebrating early.

08:09.790 --> 08:11.050
That night, we all, uh,

08:11.050 --> 08:13.000
met up at a hotel and...

08:13.800 --> 08:15.210
...hired some entertainment.

08:15.210 --> 08:17.800
You hired prostitutes.

08:18.630 --> 08:20.090
BELL: All right,
say that checks out,

08:20.090 --> 08:22.800
and none of you were here
the night of the murder.

08:22.800 --> 08:24.790
Still could have hired someone.

08:24.790 --> 08:26.800
A hit man?

08:27.380 --> 08:30.460
Honestly, Detective,
I wouldn’t know how.

08:33.919 --> 08:35.789
So, obviously,
we’ll have to wait

08:35.789 --> 08:37.340
on a bunch of prostitutes
in Akron

08:37.340 --> 08:39.169
to confirm his story,
but I believe him.

08:39.169 --> 08:41.340
Lorazepam and alcohol
is not exactly a truth serum,

08:41.340 --> 08:43.840
but it would make sticking
to a lie more difficult.

08:43.840 --> 08:46.300
That was our forensic
accounting team.

08:46.300 --> 08:48.130
Gilbert Pham’s firm
sent over his work.

08:48.130 --> 08:49.630
They’re going through it.

08:49.630 --> 08:52.790
Take a closer look at that
sales manager, Darsha.

08:52.790 --> 08:53.920
He had something
to hide.

08:53.920 --> 08:54.920
Where are you going?

08:54.920 --> 08:56.960
More family business.

09:00.670 --> 09:02.170
WATSON:
Hey. So, it turns out

09:02.170 --> 09:04.130
"Tim Darsha" is a
pretty common name.

09:04.130 --> 09:06.460
But it looks like
the one that we met

09:06.460 --> 09:07.550
does not have a record.

09:07.550 --> 09:09.790
You know, if your mom
catches you with these,

09:09.790 --> 09:12.630
she’s gonna make you
smoke every single one.

09:12.630 --> 09:13.090
(chuckles)

09:13.090 --> 09:15.300
Forensic accounting
finished going over

09:15.300 --> 09:16.340
Gilbert Pham’s work.

09:16.340 --> 09:18.090
According to them,
Summit-Stow’s financials

09:18.090 --> 09:19.050
were all in order.

09:19.050 --> 09:21.710
Thing is,
Pham went above and beyond

09:21.710 --> 09:22.880
when preparing his report.

09:22.880 --> 09:24.130
Among other things,

09:24.130 --> 09:24.920
he also checked out

09:24.920 --> 09:26.790
Summit-Stow’s
loading dock records.

09:26.790 --> 09:28.050
Judging from his notes,
he thought

09:28.050 --> 09:30.210
there was more inventory
moving through the place

09:30.210 --> 09:32.790
than the company’s cash flow
accounted for.

09:32.790 --> 09:34.590
Say the books showed Summit-Stow

09:34.590 --> 09:37.710
bought 10,000 cases
and sold 10,000 cases.

09:37.710 --> 09:40.590
All the money adds up except,
according to the loading dock,

09:40.590 --> 09:43.500
they moved 15,000 cases
in the same time.

09:43.500 --> 09:45.250
So, where’d the other
cigarettes go?

09:45.250 --> 09:47.590
Interstate cigarette smuggling
is a big problem, right?

09:47.590 --> 09:51.380
So you think Pham stumbled
onto a smuggling operation.

09:51.380 --> 09:55.340
Smugglers buy cigarettes
in lower-tax states like Ohio

09:55.340 --> 09:57.790
and sell them in
higher-tax places like here.

09:57.790 --> 09:59.790
The difference is so big,
they can clear

09:59.790 --> 10:00.880
a hundred bucks a carton.

10:00.880 --> 10:02.750
Now, the Akron PD
tracked down the girls

10:02.750 --> 10:04.790
the Summit-Stow guys
said they partied with.

10:04.790 --> 10:07.090
They confirmed
that Mr. Lowell and his team

10:07.090 --> 10:08.790
were in Ohio
the night Pham was killed.

10:08.790 --> 10:12.090
But if one of the guys
was working with smugglers--

10:12.090 --> 10:13.880
say that sales manager, Darsha--

10:13.880 --> 10:15.300
it could be
the smugglers killed Pham

10:15.300 --> 10:18.670
so they wouldn’t expose
their racket.

10:19.420 --> 10:20.790
So, what are these for?

10:20.790 --> 10:23.090
The sheriff’s office
enforces cigarette taxes

10:23.090 --> 10:24.750
in the city, so I reached out.

10:24.750 --> 10:26.790
They said a lot
of cigarettes from Ohio

10:26.790 --> 10:29.090
are showing up
in bodegas in Brooklyn,

10:29.090 --> 10:30.670
especially around Fort Greene.

10:30.670 --> 10:32.790
I asked them to send over
some samples.

10:32.790 --> 10:34.420
Any idea who the smugglers are?

10:34.420 --> 10:36.960
So far, no luck
nailing the local crew.

10:36.960 --> 10:40.800
But those tax stamps
and lot numbers are all unique.

10:40.800 --> 10:42.130
I wanted
to check ’em out.

10:42.130 --> 10:44.790
They’re definitely coming
out of the right part of Ohio

10:44.790 --> 10:48.300
to have been distributed
by Summit-Stow.

10:48.960 --> 10:50.380
You know, my stepfather used to

10:50.380 --> 10:52.210
smoke this brand
when I was a kid.

10:52.210 --> 10:53.790
Do you mind if I
borrow some of these?

10:53.790 --> 10:57.170
I think I might know a way
to find the smugglers.

10:58.210 --> 10:59.710
(door opens)

10:59.710 --> 11:00.920
(sniffing)

11:00.920 --> 11:04.380
(door closes,
footsteps approaching)

11:05.790 --> 11:07.420
Holmes.

11:07.420 --> 11:08.090
Nose.

11:08.090 --> 11:10.550
Imagine my surprise
when Miss Watson

11:10.550 --> 11:13.960
explained the particulars
of your new case.

11:13.960 --> 11:16.090
I barely can.
WATSON: Hey.

11:16.090 --> 11:18.790
You saw my text
about the cigarettes

11:18.790 --> 11:21.300
that Marcus got
from the sheriff’s?

11:21.300 --> 11:22.050
I did.

11:22.050 --> 11:24.710
I don’t recall anything
about summoning The Nose.

11:24.710 --> 11:26.550
Well, I noticed there
was something off

11:26.550 --> 11:27.790
about the smell
of the cigarettes,

11:27.790 --> 11:29.090
so I thought maybe
it was a scent

11:29.090 --> 11:30.790
they picked up in the trucks
they were

11:30.790 --> 11:32.790
smuggled in,
or the place they were kept

11:32.790 --> 11:33.790
when they arrived in New York.

11:33.790 --> 11:36.790
Either way, I thought it could
help us locate the smugglers.

11:36.790 --> 11:38.460
Mm.
What?

11:38.460 --> 11:41.800
Well, you could’ve asked me
to smell them.

11:41.800 --> 11:43.750
Well, you weren’t around.

11:43.880 --> 11:45.250
What’s the big deal?

11:45.250 --> 11:46.800
I mean, aren’t you guys friends?

11:46.800 --> 11:48.790
Oh, we are.
It’s just, uh, tobacco

11:48.790 --> 11:49.790
is the one area of olfaction

11:49.790 --> 11:51.790
in which we’ve agreed
to disagree.

11:51.790 --> 11:52.500
Excuse me?

11:52.500 --> 11:55.000
Some years ago, when
Holmes wrote his monograph

11:55.000 --> 11:56.790
on the 140
varieties of ash,

11:56.790 --> 12:00.130
I pointed out that his
distinctions between

12:00.130 --> 12:04.790
Trichinopoly and Bird’s Eye
were all wrong.

12:04.790 --> 12:05.790
He’s never let it go.

12:05.790 --> 12:07.130
Well, maybe if you’d told me

12:07.130 --> 12:09.340
what you were up to
the last couple of days,

12:09.340 --> 12:10.790
I would’ve known
I could count on you.

12:10.790 --> 12:14.840
You’ll recall I discovered
a threat to my father’s life?

12:15.550 --> 12:16.670
He believes that the person

12:16.670 --> 12:19.050
behind that threat
is a certain woman.

12:20.130 --> 12:21.630
The woman, in fact.

12:21.630 --> 12:25.170
If you don’t mind,
a little quiet, please?

12:25.170 --> 12:27.790
I’m trying to smell.

12:29.000 --> 12:30.630
(footsteps departing)

12:30.630 --> 12:32.130
I don’t know if my
father’s right.

12:32.130 --> 12:34.090
As you know, there have
been multiple attempts

12:34.090 --> 12:35.460
on his life
over the years.

12:35.460 --> 12:36.790
It’s possible
some other enemy

12:36.790 --> 12:38.210
financed this latest one.

12:38.210 --> 12:39.460
If your father is right

12:39.460 --> 12:41.500
about who’s coming
after him,

12:41.500 --> 12:42.170
are we safe?

12:42.170 --> 12:43.800
If you’re asking whether
I think Moriarty

12:43.800 --> 12:45.300
is sizing us up
for assassination,

12:45.300 --> 12:48.500
I would remind you that
her organization’s one rule

12:48.500 --> 12:49.790
is that no harm befalls me.

12:49.790 --> 12:51.790
She prefers the world
with me in it.

12:51.790 --> 12:54.550
You seem to enjoy
some tangential protection

12:54.550 --> 12:56.050
due to our
partnership.

12:56.050 --> 12:57.630
That’s reassuring.

12:57.630 --> 12:59.550
As I said, I am not convinced

12:59.550 --> 13:01.790
she has anything to do
with this.

13:01.790 --> 13:03.300
What have you found out so far?

13:03.300 --> 13:05.210
There was a MetroCard in
Vanja Borozan’s personal effects

13:05.210 --> 13:08.500
that ultimately led me to a
garage that he had been renting.

13:08.500 --> 13:09.550
In it, I found notes on

13:09.550 --> 13:10.790
the routines of
Father’s bodyguards,

13:10.790 --> 13:12.790
along with schematics
of his limousine.

13:12.790 --> 13:14.590
Borozan was planning
to kill him.

13:14.590 --> 13:17.790
I also found six one-pound bags
of coffee beans.

13:17.790 --> 13:20.380
Untouched, just left on
the table, along with

13:20.380 --> 13:21.590
the receipt of their purchase.

13:21.590 --> 13:23.840
I plan to visit the café
where they were bought tomorrow.

13:23.840 --> 13:25.380
It’s possible
that’s where Borozan

13:25.380 --> 13:26.790
and his contact
were communicating.

13:26.790 --> 13:29.550
If Moriarty is behind this,

13:29.550 --> 13:32.800
your father wants you
to help him kill her.

13:32.800 --> 13:34.050
Will you?

13:34.050 --> 13:35.170
(The Nose clears throat)

13:35.170 --> 13:38.790
THE NOSE:
I’m ready to report my findings.

13:47.300 --> 13:48.250
Pine.

13:48.250 --> 13:49.920
Star anise. Grapefruit.

13:49.920 --> 13:51.420
WATSON: Okay.
Uh, candles?

13:51.420 --> 13:52.840
Cleaning supplies?

13:52.840 --> 13:53.840
Hops.

13:53.840 --> 13:55.840
Specifically Chinook hops,

13:55.840 --> 13:58.250
grown in Oregon’s
Willamette Valley.

13:58.250 --> 14:01.340
I’d wager these cigarettes
were transported in trucks

14:01.340 --> 14:04.210
carrying hops
from the Northwest.

14:04.210 --> 14:05.590
Marcus mentioned
that the cigarettes

14:05.590 --> 14:09.880
had been turning up
in bodegas in Fort Greene.

14:12.340 --> 14:14.210
There is a craft brewery
in that area.

14:14.210 --> 14:17.960
Maybe that’s where the smugglers
are bringing their shipments.

14:19.420 --> 14:22.170
(quiet chatter)

14:25.210 --> 14:28.670
They’re not just dropping
stuff off a truck.

14:29.050 --> 14:31.840
They’re moving a lot
of inventory into the brewery.

14:31.840 --> 14:33.880
OFFICER (over radio):
Makes it more likely the owners

14:33.880 --> 14:35.130
of the brewery are in on it.

14:35.130 --> 14:36.420
Looks to me like
this might be

14:36.420 --> 14:37.630
the crew’s base of operations.

14:37.630 --> 14:40.420
Copy that. I’ll brief my team.

14:52.790 --> 14:54.130
Your guys ready?

14:54.130 --> 14:56.800
We might not get
a better chance.

14:56.800 --> 14:58.500
Two minutes out.

14:58.500 --> 15:01.550
DISPATCHER (over radio):
Major Case, Detective Bell
on the air?

15:01.550 --> 15:02.840
Detective Bell. Go.

15:02.840 --> 15:06.790
Detective Bell,
call your command.

15:12.670 --> 15:13.750
GREGSON:
Hello?

15:13.750 --> 15:14.790
Yeah, it’s Marcus.

15:14.790 --> 15:15.840
Hold off on the takedown.

15:15.840 --> 15:19.750
I got someone in my office
you’re gonna want to talk to.

15:19.750 --> 15:20.460
Who?

15:20.460 --> 15:22.170
He says you met him
earlier today,

15:22.170 --> 15:24.840
only then he said his name
was "Darsha."

15:24.840 --> 15:26.790
His real name’s Bakshi.

15:26.790 --> 15:28.090
He’s an ATF agent,

15:28.090 --> 15:32.750
and apparently, you guys
are about to blow up his op.

15:36.390 --> 15:38.050
I’ve been undercover
at Summit-Stow

15:38.050 --> 15:39.900
almost three years now.

15:40.900 --> 15:43.150
I take it from the furtive
glances yesterday that,

15:43.150 --> 15:46.310
at the very least, the company’s
president, Kip Lowell,

15:46.310 --> 15:47.390
knew about your presence.

15:47.390 --> 15:50.770
He knows. The other sales rep
who was there doesn’t.

15:50.770 --> 15:52.850
But the main reason
I didn’t blow cover

15:52.850 --> 15:54.230
is you surprised us.

15:54.230 --> 15:55.270
Agent Evaneer and I

15:55.270 --> 15:56.560
didn’t have a
chance to discuss.

15:56.560 --> 15:58.770
Agent Bakshi is based
out of Columbus.

15:58.770 --> 16:00.390
I’m here in New York.

16:00.390 --> 16:01.390
Those guys that you were about

16:01.390 --> 16:03.310
to move on yesterday--
small fish.

16:03.310 --> 16:05.440
Part of a huge ring
that moves product

16:05.440 --> 16:07.230
all over the East
and the Midwest.

16:07.230 --> 16:08.900
Pretty unconventional, isn’t it?

16:08.900 --> 16:13.230
ATF setting up shop
inside an existing company?

16:13.230 --> 16:14.390
New solution to an old problem.

16:14.390 --> 16:16.350
Running a sting operation
isn’t easy.

16:16.350 --> 16:18.900
Cigarette smugglers don’t want
to buy from just anyone.

16:18.900 --> 16:20.440
You gotta have a business
that they’ve heard of.

16:20.440 --> 16:21.770
You gotta have someone
with a history.

16:21.770 --> 16:24.390
So you borrowed a history:
Summit-Stow’s.

16:24.390 --> 16:26.310
You buy cigarettes as them,
you send them on

16:26.310 --> 16:28.400
to smugglers
in order to enact your stings.

16:28.400 --> 16:30.100
GREGSON:
So when our vic,
Gilbert Pham,

16:30.100 --> 16:31.900
noticed there was
extra inventory

16:31.900 --> 16:33.390
moving through
the loading dock,

16:33.390 --> 16:36.310
what he’d actually stumbled
onto was your operation.

16:36.310 --> 16:39.270
HOLMES: Which begs the
question-- what did you

16:39.270 --> 16:40.390
expect to happen when, uh,

16:40.390 --> 16:42.390
Summit-Stow merged
with a larger company?

16:42.390 --> 16:44.730
We expected
that Washburn Tobacco

16:44.730 --> 16:46.900
would never even notice us.

16:46.900 --> 16:48.020
Though, to be clear,

16:48.020 --> 16:50.020
there was nothing
that we were trying to hide.

16:50.020 --> 16:52.390
I mean, not from
the good guys, anyway.

16:52.390 --> 16:53.390
Maybe not.

16:53.390 --> 16:55.810
But Big Tobacco and the ATF
aren’t exactly pals.

16:55.810 --> 16:58.390
Did it occur to you
that if Washburn found out

16:58.390 --> 17:01.390
you were working inside
their new acquisition,

17:01.390 --> 17:04.650
they could just tell you
to ship out?

17:04.650 --> 17:06.940
Undo three years of
undercover work?

17:06.940 --> 17:07.730
It occurred to us.

17:07.730 --> 17:10.190
And if Washburn
had asked us to pack it up,

17:10.190 --> 17:12.390
we would have made
whatever arrests we could

17:12.390 --> 17:13.020
and taken the case down.

17:13.020 --> 17:15.390
We don’t get paid
on performance, Captain.

17:15.390 --> 17:17.390
And we certainly wouldn’t
have killed someone

17:17.390 --> 17:20.480
to protect a sting operation.
HOLMES: What about Mr. Lowell?

17:20.480 --> 17:24.270
He had a lot to gain
from the merger, didn’t he?

17:24.270 --> 17:25.390
Perhaps he thought
your operation

17:25.390 --> 17:27.270
was a secret worth killing over.

17:27.270 --> 17:30.390
I don’t see it,
but you can ask him.

17:30.390 --> 17:32.190
We will.
Our colleagues are

17:32.190 --> 17:34.190
on their way to speak
to him right now.

17:34.190 --> 17:36.900
LOWELL:Believe me,
I wanted to tell you

17:36.900 --> 17:38.390
all of this yesterday,
but I-I just

17:38.390 --> 17:40.020
didn’t think it
had anything to do

17:40.020 --> 17:41.690
with Mr. Pham’s murder.
I still don’t.

17:41.690 --> 17:45.020
And Agent Bakshi didn’t
want to blow his cover.

17:45.020 --> 17:49.100
Later on, he and Agent Evaneer

17:49.100 --> 17:51.350
said that they were gonna
tell you the truth.

17:51.350 --> 17:52.690
I asked Maggie,
my office manager,

17:52.690 --> 17:55.650
to fly out here and show
you what we showed Pham.

17:55.650 --> 17:57.020
All of the accounting files

17:57.020 --> 17:59.390
and the security videos
from the loading dock.

17:59.390 --> 18:00.440
Why the videos?

18:00.440 --> 18:02.520
Because they clear
everything up.

18:02.520 --> 18:04.390
They show how
Agent Bakshi

18:04.390 --> 18:06.190
only sold his cigarettes
to smugglers,

18:06.190 --> 18:08.270
while our guys handled
legitimate business.

18:08.270 --> 18:10.350
Should I start with that?

18:10.350 --> 18:11.100
Yeah.

18:11.100 --> 18:12.730
English bulldogs.

18:12.730 --> 18:15.020
MAGGIE: My babies.
I know calling them that

18:15.020 --> 18:16.060
makes me weird.

18:16.060 --> 18:16.900
Well, my partner

18:16.900 --> 18:18.270
puts wool cozies
on our tortoise.

18:18.270 --> 18:20.390
You’re not even
approaching weird.

18:21.560 --> 18:24.190
BELL: So Pham asked you
about the extra inventory?

18:24.190 --> 18:25.390
LOWELL:
Yeah, he flew out.

18:25.390 --> 18:26.810
We explained the whole thing.

18:26.810 --> 18:28.230
We thought it was resolved.

18:28.230 --> 18:30.390
WATSON:
Are you saying
that you told Pham

18:30.390 --> 18:31.390
about the ATF?

18:31.390 --> 18:32.600
Don’t you think
that was risky?

18:32.600 --> 18:34.190
When Washburn Tobacco
found out about it,

18:34.190 --> 18:35.600
it could have blown
the whole merger.

18:35.600 --> 18:36.770
Yeah, I worried about that,

18:36.770 --> 18:38.390
but once Pham started
asking questions,

18:38.390 --> 18:39.810
I didn’t think
I had a choice.

18:39.810 --> 18:42.150
The alternative was Washburn
would think we were crooks.

18:42.150 --> 18:43.690
That wouldn’t have
helped the sale, either.

18:43.690 --> 18:45.980
What did the ATF say
once they found out

18:45.980 --> 18:47.690
that Pham knew about them?

18:48.390 --> 18:50.390
You didn’t tell them.

18:50.390 --> 18:51.770
LOWELL:
Maybe I should have.

18:51.770 --> 18:52.440
I don’t know.

18:52.440 --> 18:54.390
Truth is that those guys
have always scared me.

18:54.390 --> 18:55.770
So, you didn’t just volunteer

18:55.770 --> 18:57.940
to let them set up
at Summit-Stow.

18:57.940 --> 19:00.020
They had something on you.

19:00.810 --> 19:04.350
A few years back, Bakshi and
Evaneer showed up with proof

19:04.350 --> 19:06.310
that smugglers were
already buying from us

19:06.310 --> 19:08.390
and we were looking
the other way.

19:08.390 --> 19:11.400
Told me that they’d raise
hell unless we’d cooperate.

19:11.400 --> 19:13.480
Check this out.

19:16.390 --> 19:18.100
Bakshi just finished a sale.

19:18.100 --> 19:21.560
Few minutes later,
this guy drove up.

19:21.560 --> 19:23.390
Yeah, that’s Agent Evaneer.

19:23.390 --> 19:25.390
Was he working undercover, too?

19:25.390 --> 19:27.730
No. Just Agent Bakshi.

19:27.730 --> 19:29.230
Nice rides.

19:29.230 --> 19:30.190
Nice?

19:30.190 --> 19:31.770
That’s a BMW M7,

19:31.770 --> 19:33.940
and that’s a Porsche 911 Turbo.

19:33.940 --> 19:35.730
Those are $150,000 cars.

19:35.730 --> 19:37.350
Maybe you could write off
Bakshi’s car

19:37.350 --> 19:39.100
to him wanting to look
the part he’s playing,

19:39.100 --> 19:40.690
but what’s
Evaneer’s excuse?

19:40.690 --> 19:42.940
The cash they take in
is kept separate

19:42.940 --> 19:44.150
from Summit-Stow, right?

19:44.150 --> 19:46.690
Any idea where it all goes?

19:46.690 --> 19:50.310
They turn it over
to the government.

19:50.310 --> 19:53.020
Don’t they?

20:14.150 --> 20:15.850
What can I get you?

20:15.850 --> 20:17.230
You the owner?

20:17.230 --> 20:20.100
If I was,
I’d have health insurance.

20:20.100 --> 20:21.520
He’s on vacation.

20:21.520 --> 20:24.810
Do you know where
that picture came from?

20:26.440 --> 20:27.690
Some of these are for sale.

20:27.690 --> 20:31.390
I can let the owner know
if you’re interested.

20:36.440 --> 20:39.390
I’d like to get
a message to her.

20:39.390 --> 20:41.480
Tell her I want to talk.

20:55.600 --> 20:58.150
WATSON (sighs):
I didn’t hear you come in.

20:58.150 --> 21:01.650
These are the videos you got
from Summit-Stow, correct?

21:01.650 --> 21:03.390
Can see what you
and Marcus saw.

21:03.390 --> 21:07.190
Aside from their fancy cars,
Agent Bakshi’s shoes are Prada.

21:07.190 --> 21:10.150
Agent Evaneer’s watch
is a Patek Philippe.

21:10.150 --> 21:14.390
It alone is worth more than
their annual salaries combined.

21:14.390 --> 21:17.810
Might be the most conspicuous
"conspicuous consumption"

21:17.810 --> 21:19.390
I’ve ever seen.

21:19.390 --> 21:21.060
I did some rough math.

21:21.060 --> 21:22.770
Based on the volume
of cigarettes they’ve sold

21:22.770 --> 21:25.390
and the fact that they’ve been
up and running

21:25.390 --> 21:26.390
for the last three years,

21:26.390 --> 21:28.770
I’d say they’ve probably made
about $30 million.

21:28.770 --> 21:30.690
Have you been able to determine
where any of it went?

21:30.690 --> 21:33.390
I can tell you where it isn’t:
in the hands of the government.

21:33.390 --> 21:35.390
The captain reached out
to the ATF in Washington.

21:35.390 --> 21:37.400
Apparently,
they told Bakshi and Evaneer

21:37.400 --> 21:39.150
that they could keep the money

21:39.150 --> 21:40.980
until the whole operation
was wrapped,

21:40.980 --> 21:43.060
and then voucher it
all at one time.

21:43.060 --> 21:45.400
If I’m right,
that’s tens of millions

21:45.400 --> 21:46.390
completely unsupervised.

21:46.390 --> 21:49.390
Not on Summit-Stow’s books
or the government’s.

21:49.390 --> 21:52.230
And unlike every other time
in human history

21:52.230 --> 21:53.350
when someone was entrusted

21:53.350 --> 21:56.020
with another person’s
money without oversight,

21:56.020 --> 21:57.440
the ATF assumed that these two

21:57.440 --> 22:00.310
would not skim off the top
to enrich themselves.

22:00.310 --> 22:01.690
Not at all idiotic.

22:01.690 --> 22:04.390
Now, if Gilbert Pham
kept asking questions

22:04.390 --> 22:05.390
about the cigarette sales

22:05.390 --> 22:07.020
that were not on Summit-Stow’s
profit statements,

22:07.020 --> 22:09.390
there’s a chance he would’ve
exposed what they were doing.

22:09.390 --> 22:13.390
Giving these two large-living
agents motive to kill him.

22:13.390 --> 22:14.850
Police are looking
for them right now.

22:14.850 --> 22:17.390
The ATF has not heard from them
since this morning.

22:17.390 --> 22:18.440
Evaneer hasn’t been home,

22:18.440 --> 22:20.350
and Bakshi checked out
of his hotel.

22:20.350 --> 22:23.390
Marcus is gonna tell us
if there’s any news.

22:23.390 --> 22:24.390
What about you?

22:24.390 --> 22:25.980
Did you find anything

22:25.980 --> 22:27.440
at that café you went to?

22:27.440 --> 22:29.230
A painting.

22:29.230 --> 22:30.980
One of hers.

22:31.480 --> 22:33.230
That can’t be a coincidence.

22:33.230 --> 22:33.980
It isn’t.

22:33.980 --> 22:35.980
And it makes it
a virtual certainty

22:35.980 --> 22:37.980
that my father is right.

22:38.810 --> 22:40.560
She’s trying to kill him.

22:40.560 --> 22:43.650
So, Moriarty is somehow
connected to that café,

22:43.650 --> 22:46.650
and Borozan bought beans
there that he never used.

22:46.650 --> 22:49.350
It supports my suspicion
that the café is a conduit

22:49.350 --> 22:51.310
through which
they exchange messages.

22:51.310 --> 22:52.650
Buying the coffee beans
is merely a cover.

22:52.650 --> 22:55.400
And since Borozan was hired
to kill your father,

22:55.400 --> 22:57.440
Moriarty has to be the
one who hired him.

22:57.440 --> 23:00.310
It’s short of proof positive,
I know,

23:00.310 --> 23:01.390
but I’m quite convinced.

23:01.390 --> 23:02.480
While I was at the café,

23:02.480 --> 23:03.900
I left a message of my own.

23:03.900 --> 23:05.270
I’m not sure
if she’ll respond.

23:05.270 --> 23:06.980
Or how.
She hasn’t written to me

23:06.980 --> 23:08.390
in close to a year.

23:08.390 --> 23:09.690
But I know several news

23:09.690 --> 23:11.100
and social media sites that she

23:11.100 --> 23:13.600
might use to contact me,
so I’ll just

23:13.600 --> 23:14.520
remain vigilant.

23:14.520 --> 23:17.190
Say that works,
she contacts you.

23:17.190 --> 23:19.690
You never answered my question
from last night.

23:19.690 --> 23:21.390
What’ll you do?

23:22.400 --> 23:23.440
Your father asked you to arrange

23:23.440 --> 23:25.100
the murder of the woman
that you love.

23:25.100 --> 23:26.770
Is that something
that you can do?

23:26.770 --> 23:28.810
Don’t know.

23:29.400 --> 23:31.600
A while ago,
I would have laughed

23:31.600 --> 23:34.150
in his face, but...

23:34.150 --> 23:36.020
It is vexing.

23:36.650 --> 23:38.650
What if you do nothing?

23:38.650 --> 23:40.390
Just let them do what they do.

23:40.390 --> 23:42.100
What do you think will happen?

23:42.100 --> 23:44.810
I honestly have no idea.

23:45.600 --> 23:47.390
But I do know that,
given the resources

23:47.390 --> 23:49.400
that each of them has
at their disposal,

23:49.400 --> 23:52.020
collateral loss of
life could be immense.

23:52.020 --> 23:56.730
I don’t think standing idly by
and doing nothing is an option.

23:56.730 --> 23:59.190
(cell phone ringing)

24:00.390 --> 24:02.480
Hey, Marcus.

24:07.980 --> 24:09.940
It was over before
we got here.

24:09.940 --> 24:12.560
Driver of that truck
was asleep in his cab.

24:12.560 --> 24:15.900
Heard two men yelling,
followed by gunfire.

24:15.900 --> 24:18.690
He’s the one who
called it in.

24:19.190 --> 24:22.560
Looks like Bakshi
died pretty quick.

24:23.560 --> 24:26.770
Evaneer took one in the gut,
one in the leg.

24:26.770 --> 24:28.390
From the looks of it,

24:28.390 --> 24:31.390
managed to drag himself
back to his car,

24:31.390 --> 24:33.020
but he must have
lost consciousness

24:33.020 --> 24:34.900
before he could go anywhere.

24:36.810 --> 24:39.230
And we’re sure they did this
to each other?

24:39.230 --> 24:41.690
Witness didn’t look till he was
sure the shooting was done,

24:41.690 --> 24:43.440
but he said they were
the only ones here.

24:43.440 --> 24:45.400
Did he hear what they
were arguing about?

24:45.400 --> 24:47.270
He said he heard
one of them yell

24:47.270 --> 24:48.900
"it wasn’t me" a bunch of times.

24:48.900 --> 24:51.390
He couldn’t tell what
"it" referred to,

24:51.390 --> 24:54.980
but I have a
pretty good idea.

24:55.390 --> 24:57.230
We found this phone
on the ground.

24:57.230 --> 24:59.770
Bakshi’s was on him,
so this must be Evaneer’s.

24:59.770 --> 25:02.940
We haven’t cracked the
password yet, but...

25:02.940 --> 25:04.940
look at the last notification.

25:04.940 --> 25:07.980
A bank transfer of $26 million

25:07.980 --> 25:09.390
out of an account
a few hours ago.

25:09.390 --> 25:10.980
Looks like we found
their slush fund,

25:10.980 --> 25:12.400
or at least where
their money was.

25:12.400 --> 25:14.390
So, judging by
the location,

25:14.390 --> 25:16.390
the two of them
were lying low.

25:16.390 --> 25:17.650
Except Evaneer
gets this message

25:17.650 --> 25:20.020
from the bank, sees all
their money’s gone.

25:20.020 --> 25:21.980
They meet up, the
accusations fly,

25:21.980 --> 25:24.390
they’re both armed,
so this happens.

25:24.390 --> 25:25.730
That leaves us
with two possibilities.

25:25.730 --> 25:29.390
Either one of these men died
lying to the other one...

25:29.980 --> 25:33.390
...or someone else
stole all their money.

25:36.220 --> 25:38.000
Ballistics
confirmed the slugs

25:38.190 --> 25:40.740
the M.E. pulled out
of Bakshi and Evaneer

25:40.740 --> 25:42.190
came from
each other’s weapons.

25:42.190 --> 25:45.190
So the two of them
build up an unsupervised

25:45.190 --> 25:46.950
$26 million slush fund,

25:46.950 --> 25:48.780
then they kill
each other over it

25:48.780 --> 25:52.530
because each one thinks
the other one stole it.

25:52.530 --> 25:53.650
Looks that way.

25:53.650 --> 25:55.700
But you guys think
they were wrong?

25:55.700 --> 25:56.280
Maybe.

25:56.280 --> 25:58.570
We had the account info
off Evaneer’s phone,

25:58.570 --> 26:01.190
so I got a court order
for the bank records.

26:01.190 --> 26:02.490
The 26 million
was transferred

26:02.490 --> 26:04.740
out of the account
yesterday afternoon

26:04.740 --> 26:06.190
and into an account
in the Caymans.

26:06.190 --> 26:08.190
Whoever did it used one
of the free

26:08.190 --> 26:09.280
Wi-Fi kiosks in Midtown.

26:09.280 --> 26:10.110
We also pulled

26:10.110 --> 26:12.240
Bakshi and Evaneer’s
cell tower logs.

26:12.240 --> 26:14.150
At the time the transfer
was made,

26:14.150 --> 26:16.190
neither one was anywhere
near that kiosk.

26:16.190 --> 26:17.280
Which means
someone else

26:17.280 --> 26:19.450
did steal that money
from both of them.

26:19.450 --> 26:20.490
That’s one possibility.

26:20.490 --> 26:22.570
Another is that one of them
had a helper.

26:22.570 --> 26:24.860
At the very least,
it proves a third party

26:24.860 --> 26:26.030
was aware of the slush fund.

26:26.030 --> 26:27.190
And we’re
still thinking

26:27.190 --> 26:28.360
Gilbert Pham was killed
to cover up

26:28.360 --> 26:29.900
what was going on
with that slush fund.

26:29.900 --> 26:31.740
Yeah.
Bakshi had already alibied,

26:31.740 --> 26:34.280
and we checked--
Evaneer was at his office

26:34.280 --> 26:35.740
late the night of the murder.

26:35.740 --> 26:38.190
Makes this third party
our best suspect.

26:38.190 --> 26:39.320
I’ve got
detectives checking

26:39.320 --> 26:40.530
the cameras
around the Wi-Fi kiosk

26:40.530 --> 26:42.650
they logged in from,
but they could have been

26:42.650 --> 26:45.990
in the back seat of a
passing cab, for all we know.

26:45.990 --> 26:48.280
So you’re not holding
your breath.
Sherlock and Joan

26:48.280 --> 26:51.450
have been going over the rest
of the slush fund’s records.

26:51.450 --> 26:52.650
We’re hoping something in there

26:52.650 --> 26:55.990
might tell us who else knew
about the account.

26:55.990 --> 26:57.740
More transfers to the Caymans.

26:57.740 --> 27:00.190
These all go into the same
account as the 26 million?

27:00.190 --> 27:02.780
HOLMES:
They started off small
about eight months ago.

27:02.780 --> 27:04.320
The first was for
a modest $5,000.

27:04.320 --> 27:06.700
Then, over time,
transfers got larger.

27:06.700 --> 27:08.190
Prior to the emptying of
the account yesterday,

27:08.190 --> 27:10.320
they added up
to just over three million.

27:10.320 --> 27:12.700
Sounds like someone
was testing the waters.

27:12.700 --> 27:14.780
Siphoned off a little bit,
then got bolder

27:14.780 --> 27:16.190
when no one noticed.

27:16.190 --> 27:17.190
We thought the same thing.

27:17.190 --> 27:18.190
GREGSON:
And this was going on

27:18.190 --> 27:20.990
for months before Gilbert Pham
started poking around.

27:20.990 --> 27:22.950
So, if he discovered
the slush fund,

27:22.950 --> 27:25.200
he would have also
discovered the theft.

27:25.200 --> 27:28.190
So, who owns the account
in the Caymans?

27:28.190 --> 27:31.450
So far, the bank has opted
to protect its client’s privacy.

27:31.450 --> 27:33.190
I’ve reached out to a
friend in George Town

27:33.190 --> 27:35.200
who might be able to
persuade them otherwise,

27:35.200 --> 27:37.030
but, um, even if he does,

27:37.030 --> 27:39.280
the owner may be hidden
behind an alias

27:39.280 --> 27:40.200
or a shell company.

27:40.200 --> 27:42.190
We’ll just have
to wait and see.

27:42.190 --> 27:44.150
Right. That explains this color.

27:44.150 --> 27:46.150
Um, what about this other one?

27:46.150 --> 27:48.190
BELL:
Yeah, those
are weirder.

27:48.190 --> 27:49.990
They go back farther,
starting about a year

27:49.990 --> 27:52.150
after Bakshi and Evaneer
got up and running.

27:52.150 --> 27:54.900
Over a dozen transfers
out of the slush fund,

27:54.900 --> 27:57.200
ranging from around ten grand
to 50 grand,

27:57.200 --> 27:59.320
going to a handful
of bank accounts

27:59.320 --> 28:01.070
in cities all over the country.

28:01.070 --> 28:03.490
Baltimore, Louisville,
Tampa, Phoenix.

28:03.490 --> 28:06.110
So far, we don’t know
what those transfers are

28:06.110 --> 28:07.610
or why those cities.

28:07.610 --> 28:09.280
GREGSON: I think I can
explain the cities.

28:09.280 --> 28:11.190
Over the years,
I’ve done a lot of

28:11.190 --> 28:12.610
joint investigations
with the Feds.

28:12.610 --> 28:17.030
Every one of those cities
has an ATF field office.

28:17.030 --> 28:19.820
You think other ATF agents
knew about the slush fund?

28:19.820 --> 28:22.490
Maybe Bakshi and Evaneer
were getting ripped off

28:22.490 --> 28:24.320
by one of their own.

28:26.150 --> 28:29.360
BELL:
When examining Agents Bakshi
and Evaneer’s slush fund,

28:29.360 --> 28:32.860
we noticed a series of
transfers going to cities

28:32.860 --> 28:33.860
with ATF field offices.

28:33.860 --> 28:36.190
We compared
those transfers

28:36.190 --> 28:38.320
to the two agents’
phone records.

28:38.320 --> 28:40.200
Each one was preceded by a call

28:40.200 --> 28:41.950
from your cell phone.

28:43.070 --> 28:44.190
So?

28:44.190 --> 28:46.190
I’ve shown you a lot
of patience, Captain.

28:46.190 --> 28:48.700
Sitting here, having this talk
in an interrogation room.

28:48.700 --> 28:51.650
You said this is about what
happened to Bakshi and Evaneer.

28:51.650 --> 28:54.190
What happened is
they shot each other.

28:54.190 --> 28:57.320
As far as we know,
that’s true, but mainly,

28:57.320 --> 29:01.360
we’re interested
in the murder of Gilbert Pham.

29:01.360 --> 29:02.150
Who?

29:02.150 --> 29:03.570
WATSON: Pham was a
discovery lawyer

29:03.570 --> 29:04.900
hired by Washburn Tobacco

29:04.900 --> 29:06.020
to vet the purchase
of Summit-Stow.

29:06.020 --> 29:07.190
We think he
was murdered

29:07.190 --> 29:09.060
to keep him
from digging too deeply

29:09.060 --> 29:11.270
into Evaneer
and Bakshi’s slush fund.

29:11.270 --> 29:12.390
GREGSON:
We honestly don’t know

29:12.390 --> 29:14.770
why you were wiring money
all over the country,

29:14.770 --> 29:17.230
but whatever the
reason, the timing

29:17.230 --> 29:21.020
of those phone calls tells us
you knew about the fund.

29:21.020 --> 29:23.650
And since we already ruled
out Bakshi and Evaneer

29:23.650 --> 29:26.390
for Pham’s murder,
that leaves you.

29:26.390 --> 29:27.310
(snickers)

29:27.310 --> 29:30.770
You people have it so wrong,
I don’t know where to start.

29:30.770 --> 29:31.350
Do tell.

29:31.350 --> 29:34.390
I wouldn’t have killed anyone
to hide anything.

29:34.390 --> 29:36.900
You know
what those transfers were?

29:36.900 --> 29:38.190
Us doing good.

29:38.190 --> 29:42.100
We used the money
to fund other ATF ops.

29:42.440 --> 29:46.390
How would you feel
if every step you took here,

29:46.390 --> 29:49.190
you had to run it
through the DMV?

29:49.600 --> 29:50.690
The number
of targets we lost

29:50.690 --> 29:53.390
waiting for
Congressional funding...

29:53.390 --> 29:54.270
I lost count.

29:54.270 --> 29:57.350
Bakshi and Evaneer were sitting
on all that cash.

29:57.390 --> 30:00.390
I suggested we use it
to cut some red tape.

30:00.390 --> 30:02.390
So this was your idea.

30:02.390 --> 30:04.400
Damn right.
Ho-Ho-Hold up.

30:04.400 --> 30:06.600
You were using
off-the-books money

30:06.600 --> 30:10.390
from an ongoing operation
to pay for...

30:10.390 --> 30:11.390
what exactly?

30:11.390 --> 30:13.980
Whatever our agents needed
to catch the bad guys.

30:13.980 --> 30:14.810
They’d call me,

30:14.810 --> 30:17.230
I’d call the guys,
and we’d make it happen.

30:17.230 --> 30:21.150
Untraceable license plates,
hotel rooms, vehicles.

30:21.150 --> 30:24.390
Prada shoes, six-figure watches.

30:26.650 --> 30:28.390
If those two were sticking
their hands

30:28.390 --> 30:29.520
in the till, that’s on them.

30:29.520 --> 30:31.770
BELL:
So... humor us.

30:31.770 --> 30:33.390
Where were you five nights ago

30:33.390 --> 30:35.440
when Pham was killed?
Friday?

30:35.440 --> 30:36.810
I was in Vegas

30:36.810 --> 30:38.150
at a friend’s bachelor party.

30:38.150 --> 30:40.270
I hear they have
a lot of cameras there,

30:40.270 --> 30:41.520
so I’m sure you can confirm it.

30:41.520 --> 30:43.730
We’re gonna need
your travel records

30:43.730 --> 30:47.690
and the names of the friends
you were with.

30:48.440 --> 30:50.650
Did any of the agents
you were funding

30:50.650 --> 30:52.810
know the details of the account?
No.

30:52.810 --> 30:56.650
Can you think of anyone else
who knew about the slush fund?

30:57.400 --> 30:58.810
They had a helper.

30:58.810 --> 31:01.150
Someone who managed
the account with them.

31:01.150 --> 31:03.150
Did this helper have a name?

31:03.150 --> 31:05.440
I heard them use
a nickname sometimes.

31:05.440 --> 31:09.560
"Bulldog will handle it,"
stuff like that.

31:11.020 --> 31:13.230
Would you excuse us?

31:17.480 --> 31:19.000
Do you remember
Kip Lowell’s office manager

31:19.050 --> 31:20.350
from the hotel yesterday?

31:20.350 --> 31:22.590
Sure. Maggie Foltz, right?

31:22.590 --> 31:23.590
Yeah. And remember her laptop?

31:23.590 --> 31:26.590
Her wallpaper had a picture
of her and her bulldogs.

31:26.590 --> 31:28.140
I think she’s Bulldog.

31:28.140 --> 31:29.600
Makes sense.

31:29.600 --> 31:31.550
She knew about
the undercover operation.

31:31.550 --> 31:33.850
Since she handled
Summit-Stow’s accounting,

31:33.850 --> 31:34.890
the ATF guys
might have

31:34.890 --> 31:36.590
asked her for help
with theirs, too.

31:36.590 --> 31:38.350
You’re thinking she’s the one
who embezzled

31:38.350 --> 31:41.760
from the slush fund, then
she murdered Gilbert Pham

31:41.760 --> 31:42.680
for asking too many questions?

31:42.680 --> 31:44.390
BELL:
I’m pretty sure
she and Lowell

31:44.390 --> 31:45.760
flew back to Ohio yesterday.

31:45.760 --> 31:48.720
I’ll call the Akron Police,
let them know

31:48.720 --> 31:51.050
we want to talk
to her.

31:55.010 --> 31:57.590
(cell phone ringing)

32:00.670 --> 32:03.000
I’d say we should keep the
line clear, but it isn’t 1970.

32:03.560 --> 32:04.850
Any word?
HOLMES: Not yet.

32:04.850 --> 32:07.150
I’m not sure what sort
of contact to expect.

32:07.150 --> 32:08.900
You?
Well, best we can
piece together,

32:08.900 --> 32:11.650
the woman I texted you about,
Maggie Foltz,

32:11.650 --> 32:13.610
flew back to Akron
with Kip Lowell

32:13.610 --> 32:14.610
like nothing was wrong.

32:14.610 --> 32:16.980
They got off the plane,
they went their separate ways,

32:16.980 --> 32:18.560
and no one’s seen her since.

32:18.560 --> 32:19.770
Her car is still at the airport.

32:19.770 --> 32:22.270
With $30 million
in an account in the Caymans

32:22.270 --> 32:23.480
and a full day’s head start,

32:23.480 --> 32:24.850
she could be anywhere
in the world.

32:24.850 --> 32:26.440
Marcus is pulling
her phone records

32:26.440 --> 32:27.940
and her credit card history.

32:27.940 --> 32:29.690
So we’ll go through those
and see

32:29.690 --> 32:30.900
if there’s any new activity.

32:30.900 --> 32:32.440
Maybe we’ll get lucky.

32:32.440 --> 32:33.560
(doorbell rings)

32:33.560 --> 32:34.980
Was that the door?

32:34.980 --> 32:36.310
It was.

32:36.850 --> 32:39.400
Safe to say it isn’t Miss Foltz.

32:39.850 --> 32:41.850
Well, be careful.

32:53.150 --> 32:54.610
Mr. Holmes.

32:54.610 --> 32:55.850
How did you know I live here?

32:55.850 --> 33:00.900
Do you always ask questions
you already know the answers to?

33:01.850 --> 33:05.060
Oh, you didn’t expect her
to come herself,

33:05.060 --> 33:06.900
did you?

33:06.900 --> 33:09.110
She sent me.

33:18.230 --> 33:20.690
Do you have a name?

33:24.230 --> 33:26.810
It’s Ellory.

33:29.440 --> 33:33.230
So, how did you come to
be in Moriarty’s employ?

33:33.850 --> 33:34.860
Does it matter?

33:34.860 --> 33:37.900
I just recognize
the tattoo on your shoulder.

33:38.440 --> 33:40.850
It’s used by a Guatemalan
amphetamine ring

33:40.850 --> 33:42.480
to brand their
drug mules.

33:42.480 --> 33:43.900
Perhaps you think
you owe her

33:43.900 --> 33:45.360
for removing you
from a bad situation.

33:45.360 --> 33:47.650
Or perhaps you’re just unaware
of how many more

33:47.650 --> 33:50.850
bad situations
you’ll help her create.

33:50.850 --> 33:54.610
We’re all fish eating
other fish, Mr. Holmes.

33:54.610 --> 33:58.400
I’d rather be swimming
with the biggest one.

33:59.020 --> 34:03.850
You said you wanted to talk,
so talk.

34:04.310 --> 34:05.770
It’s become clear that tensions

34:05.770 --> 34:08.270
between your employer
and my father

34:08.270 --> 34:09.770
are coming to a head.

34:09.770 --> 34:11.730
It should come
as no surprise

34:11.730 --> 34:12.850
that my father has asked me

34:12.850 --> 34:16.810
to help bring about
Moriarty’s death.

34:17.730 --> 34:21.060
After slaving over the question
for quite some time,

34:21.060 --> 34:24.850
I’ve decided
I’d rather discuss his.

34:28.850 --> 34:30.850
(door opens)

34:31.980 --> 34:34.850
(door closes,
footsteps approaching)

34:34.850 --> 34:35.810
More ATF agents.

34:35.810 --> 34:38.610
These guys took money
from the slush fund, too?

34:38.610 --> 34:39.770
Specifically,
agents working

34:39.770 --> 34:42.770
out of the Charlotte,
North Carolina field office.

34:42.770 --> 34:46.360
Maggie Foltz’s phone records
show one call

34:46.360 --> 34:48.850
after she landed in Akron--

34:48.850 --> 34:51.110
to a burner registered
in Charlotte.

34:51.110 --> 34:54.850
I reviewed surveillance footage
from the Akron-Canton Airport,

34:54.850 --> 34:56.190
and the last camera
to pick her up,

34:56.190 --> 34:58.270
she was headed
to the private terminal.

34:58.270 --> 34:59.980
Video in that terminal
is lacking.

34:59.980 --> 35:03.020
You think she got
into a private plane?
I do.

35:03.020 --> 35:04.810
Moreover, I think she had help.

35:04.810 --> 35:05.850
There are no records

35:05.850 --> 35:07.060
of her arranging
that flight herself.

35:07.060 --> 35:10.190
Whoever was on the other end
of that call picked her up.

35:10.190 --> 35:11.440
I believe she was extracted.

35:11.440 --> 35:12.850
And since the call
was to Charlotte

35:12.850 --> 35:15.610
and all of those agents
benefitted from her help before,

35:15.610 --> 35:17.810
you think those are the best
suspects for her accomplice.

35:17.810 --> 35:20.310
It’s amazing to me how many
of these guys were corrupt.

35:20.310 --> 35:22.480
I was struck by the same thought
when you described

35:22.480 --> 35:25.980
Agent Hobbs’s
unrepentant attitude.

35:25.980 --> 35:29.850
All of these men--
Hobbs, Bakshi, Evaneer--

35:29.850 --> 35:31.810
they saw themselves
as the good guys.

35:31.810 --> 35:32.690
Yes, they were
breaking the law,

35:32.690 --> 35:34.900
but it was okay because they
were catching bad guys.

35:34.900 --> 35:38.020
And it gave these men permission
to commit their crimes.

35:38.020 --> 35:39.850
And those markings?

35:39.850 --> 35:42.440
HOLMES:
An irony I discovered.

35:42.440 --> 35:43.560
Despite these men’s belief

35:43.560 --> 35:45.850
that the ends
justified the means,

35:45.850 --> 35:47.480
if the agents had any
additional success

35:47.480 --> 35:50.610
thanks to their slush-fund
funding, it was short-lived.

35:50.610 --> 35:51.560
Across the board,

35:51.560 --> 35:54.690
within months of Bakshi
and Evaneer handing out money,

35:54.690 --> 35:58.940
arrest rates for all
of the agents involved dropped.

35:58.940 --> 36:00.690
Why?

36:00.690 --> 36:02.060
I’ve got no idea.

36:02.060 --> 36:03.850
Perhaps once they no longer
had to work

36:03.850 --> 36:06.690
so hard for funding,
they got lazy.

36:07.020 --> 36:09.850
You said the drop in arrests
wasn’t right away.

36:09.850 --> 36:10.850
When was it?

36:10.850 --> 36:12.690
About 18 months ago.

36:12.940 --> 36:14.440
That’s when Maggie Foltz

36:14.440 --> 36:15.860
started working
with Summit-Stow.

36:15.860 --> 36:17.730
That means something to you?
Yeah.

36:17.730 --> 36:20.730
I think I know why the agents’
arrest rates dropped.

36:20.730 --> 36:24.650
And if I’m right, I also
know how to find her.

36:26.980 --> 36:28.810
Glad this worked out
with your schedule, Mr. Ventura.

36:28.810 --> 36:30.850
Sure you’re a busy man.
(door closes)

36:30.850 --> 36:33.940
You’ve met Miss Watson
and Detective Bell.

36:33.940 --> 36:35.730
Always happy to do
what I can

36:35.730 --> 36:36.850
for the folks who wear a badge.

36:36.850 --> 36:38.810
Those are pretty
words, and I’m sure

36:38.810 --> 36:39.860
they’re mostly true.

36:39.860 --> 36:41.400
I hope they are today.

36:41.400 --> 36:43.020
Why wouldn’t they be?

36:43.020 --> 36:45.020
Well, you know from when
we met the other day

36:45.020 --> 36:46.520
we’ve been investigating
the murder of

36:46.520 --> 36:48.110
your discovery lawyer,
Gilbert Pham, right?

36:48.110 --> 36:49.480
Were you aware
that Pham

36:49.480 --> 36:52.520
discovered an undercover
ATF operation going on

36:52.520 --> 36:54.730
inside Summit-Stow Distributors?

36:55.480 --> 36:56.730
No.

36:56.730 --> 36:57.850
I had no idea.

36:58.850 --> 37:01.520
Turns out those agents
were running

37:01.520 --> 37:02.850
an unsupervised slush fund,

37:02.850 --> 37:06.190
using it to finance
other ATF operations,

37:06.190 --> 37:07.690
circumventing Congress.

37:07.690 --> 37:09.060
All sounds serious.

37:09.060 --> 37:11.110
I don’t see what that
has to do with me.

37:11.110 --> 37:12.980
WATSON:
Well, my partner and I
found something strange

37:12.980 --> 37:16.440
about the agents who took
money from the slush fund.

37:16.440 --> 37:17.650
All of their
arrest rates dropped

37:17.650 --> 37:20.850
once a woman named Maggie Foltz
started helping them.

37:20.850 --> 37:22.860
Now, before Maggie
worked at Summit-Stow,

37:22.860 --> 37:24.690
she worked
at Washburn Tobacco,

37:24.690 --> 37:27.190
which is based
in Charlotte, North Carolina.

37:27.190 --> 37:29.520
BELL:
Maggie disappeared
two days ago

37:29.520 --> 37:32.190
after calling
a phone number in Charlotte.

37:32.190 --> 37:34.850
We went back through
the private flight traffic

37:34.850 --> 37:36.900
at Akron-Canton Airport
for that day.

37:36.900 --> 37:38.900
It wasn’t easy to spot
until we knew

37:38.900 --> 37:39.810
what we were looking for,

37:39.810 --> 37:42.190
but one jet that flew in and out
around the right time

37:42.190 --> 37:45.850
is owned by a company
that’s owned by a company

37:45.850 --> 37:46.850
that you personally own.

37:46.850 --> 37:49.060
WATSON:
So Maggie was your mole
at Summit-Stow.

37:49.060 --> 37:50.980
You knew about
the ATF operation.

37:50.980 --> 37:52.360
Somehow, you found out about it,

37:52.360 --> 37:54.020
and then you planted
Maggie there

37:54.020 --> 37:55.400
to keep an eye
on it for you.

37:55.400 --> 37:56.650
BELL: I don’t
have to tell you

37:56.650 --> 37:59.310
that Big Tobacco
loves cigarette smugglers.

37:59.310 --> 38:01.520
In high-tax cities
like New York and Boston,

38:01.520 --> 38:04.560
smuggled cigarettes
are over half your business.

38:04.560 --> 38:06.230
You provided
illegal aid.

38:06.230 --> 38:08.060
You helped the smugglers
avoid the ATF

38:08.060 --> 38:10.060
by tipping them
to whatever activity

38:10.060 --> 38:10.860
Maggie knew about.

38:10.860 --> 38:13.850
You have proof
to back that up, son?

38:13.850 --> 38:15.980
Yeah. We do.

38:15.980 --> 38:17.150
That phone number
Maggie called

38:17.150 --> 38:18.850
to get your plane
to come pick her up--

38:18.850 --> 38:21.110
she called that same number
from Akron

38:21.110 --> 38:22.440
the day Gilbert Pham was killed.

38:22.440 --> 38:24.850
And according to the
flight records at both airports,

38:24.850 --> 38:27.690
your plane made a flight
from Akron to La Guardia

38:27.690 --> 38:28.690
and back that night.

38:28.690 --> 38:30.860
WATSON: Now, your pilot
has already agreed to testify

38:30.860 --> 38:33.520
that he took Maggie to
and from New York that night.

38:33.520 --> 38:35.980
And the flight times also fit
the time frame in which

38:35.980 --> 38:38.520
Gilbert Pham was held hostage
and then shot.

38:38.520 --> 38:42.230
Police also matched fibers
they found in Pham’s house

38:42.230 --> 38:43.400
to the carpet
on your plane.

38:43.400 --> 38:45.190
GREGSON:
Now, I’m willing
to believe

38:45.190 --> 38:46.850
you didn’t know
you were helping

38:46.850 --> 38:50.730
a murderer at the time,
but you know it now.

38:51.150 --> 38:53.850
I’ve already talked with
the Department of Justice.

38:53.850 --> 38:56.520
Washburn Tobacco
is going to be slapped

38:56.520 --> 38:58.900
with a penalty
for aiding smugglers.

38:58.900 --> 39:00.860
But the DOJ
has agreed

39:00.860 --> 39:06.310
to make that penalty smaller
if you help us bring her in.

39:11.850 --> 39:13.480
Thank you for coming.

39:13.480 --> 39:15.270
Come in.

39:16.900 --> 39:21.060
I was on my way to the airport
when I got your call.

39:21.850 --> 39:25.520
I take it you’ve come
to a decision about my request?

39:25.520 --> 39:26.850
Yes, I’ve done more than that.

39:26.850 --> 39:29.850
I’ve exchanged messages
with Moriarty.

39:29.850 --> 39:30.690
Oh.

39:30.690 --> 39:31.850
Naturally, I assumed you’d find

39:31.850 --> 39:33.850
a way to contact her
if you wanted to.

39:33.850 --> 39:36.810
Didn’t expect
it so quickly.

39:36.810 --> 39:38.230
Where is she?

39:38.230 --> 39:39.360
I have no idea.

39:39.360 --> 39:40.850
What’s our next move?

39:40.850 --> 39:42.850
I said I’d exchanged
messages with her.

39:42.850 --> 39:43.980
You’re jumping to conclusions

39:43.980 --> 39:45.520
about the content
of those messages.

39:45.520 --> 39:46.690
First among them that you’re

39:46.690 --> 39:48.610
going to like
what I have to say.

39:48.610 --> 39:51.650
I wouldn’t be
so sure.

39:51.650 --> 39:52.440
Go on.

39:52.440 --> 39:54.360
She and I have agreed
to an armistice.

39:54.360 --> 39:57.520
A temporary cease-fire
on both sides.

39:57.520 --> 39:59.230
And how did you manage that?

39:59.230 --> 40:02.770
I told her that should she
succeed in assassinating you,

40:02.770 --> 40:07.060
I would assume your role at the
head of her former organization.

40:07.980 --> 40:11.110
For the time being,
she will remain inactive,

40:11.110 --> 40:12.850
allow you
to continue your work.

40:12.850 --> 40:14.850
I believe she will honor
our agreement.

40:14.850 --> 40:18.850
And assuming she does,
I expect you to do the same.

40:18.850 --> 40:23.400
And how long is this cease-fire
supposed to last?

40:23.400 --> 40:25.360
Until you die
of old age.

40:25.360 --> 40:28.270
I persuaded her
that won’t be long.

40:30.230 --> 40:31.980
You realize, of course,
that you’re just

40:31.980 --> 40:34.360
staving off the inevitable?

40:34.360 --> 40:35.310
I do.

40:35.310 --> 40:38.480
You’re going to have to deal
with her at some point.

40:38.480 --> 40:41.480
And when that time comes,
the way you’ve planned it,

40:41.480 --> 40:43.020
I won’t be there to help.

40:43.020 --> 40:45.690
And that’s as it should be.

40:46.060 --> 40:49.610
When the time comes--
if it comes--

40:49.610 --> 40:55.850
the problem of Moriarty
will be mine and mine alone.

40:57.360 --> 41:00.440
We’ll speak again.

41:00.440 --> 41:02.850
Soon, I hope.
