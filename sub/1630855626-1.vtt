00:17.642 --> 00:19.144
[Poison Ivy] Last season
on Harley Quinn...

00:19.227 --> 00:21.187
I got my green on.

00:21.312 --> 00:23.815
Batman created zombies
instead of going to therapy,
for fuck's sake.

00:23.898 --> 00:25.608
Joker became the mayor.

00:25.692 --> 00:28.153
I went CEO at the LOD.

00:28.278 --> 00:30.488
And Harley,
she joined the Bat Fam.

00:30.613 --> 00:32.406
All right, y'all caught up?

00:32.490 --> 00:33.783
[gunshots]

00:33.867 --> 00:35.493
[both grunting]

00:35.577 --> 00:37.829
Come on! I'm just trying to--
[grunts]

00:37.954 --> 00:39.164
Nerts, that hurt!

00:39.289 --> 00:41.541
[yells] I am just trying
to drop off lunch

00:41.666 --> 00:44.586
for my hot
and powerful girlfriend.

00:44.669 --> 00:46.046
[Harley grunting]

00:46.171 --> 00:47.797
[both grunting]

00:47.881 --> 00:49.174
[man screams] Ow!

00:49.299 --> 00:52.927
I can't let good guys
into the Legion of Doom.

00:53.011 --> 00:54.721
[cell phone ringing]

00:54.846 --> 00:57.015
-Hey, babe,
is the Bat Signal working?
-[alarm blaring faintly]

00:57.140 --> 00:58.350
Uh, yeah, why? Wait, wait.

00:58.475 --> 00:59.893
D... Does it not work
during the day?

01:00.018 --> 01:01.686
Honey, you forgot your lunch.

01:01.770 --> 01:05.565
So I thought
it would be, like, sexy
if I, like, did a crime,

01:05.690 --> 01:07.442
and then you and the Bat Fam
showed up.

01:07.525 --> 01:10.653
Aw, I'm at the LOD
with your lunch, ohh.

01:10.737 --> 01:12.030
-God, we're cute.
-[man screams]

01:12.155 --> 01:13.198
So damn cute.

01:13.281 --> 01:14.574
Shit, more guards are coming.

01:14.699 --> 01:16.201
There must be,
like, a shift change.

01:16.326 --> 01:17.369
Okay, good luck
with your first day.

01:17.494 --> 01:18.620
I love you so much. I gotta go.

01:18.703 --> 01:21.289
-Love you more.
-[both kissing]

01:21.373 --> 01:23.541
[theme music playing]

01:36.721 --> 01:37.555
[elevator dings]

01:39.223 --> 01:41.476
-Lex.
-There's my new SHE-EO.

01:41.559 --> 01:43.645
Girl power and all that stuff.

01:43.728 --> 01:45.479
You know,
I got some pretty big plans.

01:45.563 --> 01:47.399
I'm starting
with the corporate rebrand.

01:47.524 --> 01:50.068
What do you think of, like,
socially conscious evil?

01:50.151 --> 01:51.735
Totally. Totally.

01:51.820 --> 01:53.905
First, I thought I'd destroy
an oil rig safely, obviously.

01:53.988 --> 01:56.825
And make the execs
drink all the oil, and boom,

01:56.908 --> 01:59.911
high body count,
zero environmental damage.

02:00.036 --> 02:04.165
All the deets are here in this
color-coded tabbed binder.

02:04.249 --> 02:06.084
[Lex] Mmm.

02:06.167 --> 02:08.211
Well, you know what?
I think we'd start things off
on the right foot

02:08.294 --> 02:11.798
to do, like, a ceremonial
handing over the keys
in front of everyone.

02:11.923 --> 02:14.134
Can't. I'm going
to my launchpad on the roof

02:14.259 --> 02:15.301
and then heading to the moon.

02:15.427 --> 02:16.886
The moon.
That's cool. That's cool.

02:16.970 --> 02:19.097
Hope the rocket isn't
shaped like a giant penis.

02:19.180 --> 02:20.515
[scoffs] Am I right?

02:20.598 --> 02:22.225
There is a scientific reason

02:22.308 --> 02:23.810
the rocket needs
to look like that.

02:23.935 --> 02:24.894
[elevator dings]

02:24.978 --> 02:26.271
All right, this is you.

02:26.353 --> 02:28.356
Lean in, disrupt,
and things of that nature.

02:28.440 --> 02:31.026
[scoffing] It ain't no thang.
[laughing]

02:31.109 --> 02:32.610
Oh, shit. That was terrible.

02:36.448 --> 02:38.324
[Gorilla Grodd] Move, lady.

02:38.450 --> 02:41.411
I want a perfect view
of the doorway
for where the new CEO comes in.

02:41.494 --> 02:43.954
I hope he's chill.
I hope he thinks I'm chill.

02:44.039 --> 02:45.331
-Shut up.
-[device squeaking]

02:45.457 --> 02:48.126
I want to be able to hear
the new CEO's footsteps.

02:48.251 --> 02:53.298
Oh, uh, so I'm guessing nobody
sort of, um, let you guys in.

02:53.381 --> 02:56.091
But, uh, surprise. [chuckles]
I'm the new CEO.

02:56.176 --> 02:57.927
[Metallo] Fuck, it is true.

02:58.011 --> 02:59.304
Look at her mug.

02:59.387 --> 03:00.722
-[roaring]
-[Metallo] Frick.

03:00.805 --> 03:03.433
-She must have slept with Lex.
-[all protesting]

03:03.516 --> 03:05.143
[Snowflame] I hope
she gets pregnant.

03:05.226 --> 03:08.772
[sniffs] Lex bowed
to the woke mob
and hired a skirt.

03:08.855 --> 03:10.732
-[Man-Bat screeching]
-Okay.

03:10.815 --> 03:12.359
Why don't we all just,
like, take a seat
and we can all discuss--

03:12.484 --> 03:13.651
How you think we should stop

03:13.777 --> 03:15.779
brewing the break room
coffee with beer?

03:15.862 --> 03:18.531
Yeah, well, 'cause that sounds
fucking gross.

03:18.656 --> 03:23.119
But listen up. The plan is
socially conscious evil.

03:23.203 --> 03:24.829
Now, if you look
in your dossier,

03:24.913 --> 03:27.957
you're gonna see how together
we're gonna make that happen.

03:28.041 --> 03:29.793
Never.

03:29.876 --> 03:32.504
If this folder wasn't
literally perfect
for doing lines off of,

03:32.629 --> 03:34.381
I'd throw it in the trash.

03:34.506 --> 03:35.965
That's right, the trash.

03:36.049 --> 03:38.385
Even though
I know this is recyclable.

03:38.510 --> 03:41.096
[snorts and screams]

03:41.179 --> 03:43.723
[Metallo] If we wanted to get
bossed around by a lady,

03:43.848 --> 03:45.350
-we would get girlfriends.
-[Gorilla Grodd grunting]

03:45.475 --> 03:48.520
This is so not chill!
[grunting]

03:52.023 --> 03:53.983
-[grunts in frustration]
-[device squeaking]

03:54.067 --> 03:55.110
Oh, shit. That's a grenade.

03:55.192 --> 03:56.695
-[explosion]
-Fuck.

04:07.622 --> 04:09.874
[Harley] "Wonder Woman's
favorite winter salad recipes"?

04:10.000 --> 04:12.544
Oh, God. She has more than one?
Kill me.

04:12.669 --> 04:14.838
Ooh, the Hottest Hotties list.

04:14.921 --> 04:16.047
Such a fun issue.

04:16.130 --> 04:17.716
I start a new gig in, like, 20.

04:17.798 --> 04:19.718
Don't wanna show up early
and seem like a try-hard,
you know.

04:19.801 --> 04:20.802
The hell?

04:20.885 --> 04:22.887
Devora Macklewaithe's
number three?

04:22.971 --> 04:24.597
What makes her so hot?

04:24.723 --> 04:27.851
[man] Miss Macklewaithe has
the most beautiful
clavicle in Gotham.

04:27.934 --> 04:29.936
For sure, I mean,
whatever a clavicle is,

04:30.061 --> 04:32.022
she certainly, certainly
got a nice one.

04:32.105 --> 04:35.066
Oh, Professor Pyg,
I can't be seen talking to you,
no offense.

04:35.150 --> 04:36.443
Because I'm not a hottie?

04:36.568 --> 04:38.028
Notties are people, too.

04:38.111 --> 04:40.238
'Cause I'm a major player
on the hero scene.

04:40.363 --> 04:41.990
Yep, me and Wonder Woman.

04:42.073 --> 04:44.075
You know, she called
spinach the new romaine,
but the old kale?

04:46.703 --> 04:48.413
Uh, okay.

04:48.538 --> 04:50.081
That old lady seems
to be having one heck
of a time crossing the street.

04:50.206 --> 04:52.042
I gotta go save her ass, bye.

04:53.626 --> 04:55.670
[computer beeping]

04:56.546 --> 04:58.381
[rock music playing]

04:58.465 --> 04:59.591
[grunting]

05:00.592 --> 05:02.344
It's a bird, it's a plane.

05:02.427 --> 05:04.929
It's motherfucking
Harley Quinn!

05:09.100 --> 05:10.268
Hello?

05:10.393 --> 05:11.936
Was my pose
not dramatic enough?

05:12.020 --> 05:13.772
I blame your
very soft lighting.

05:13.855 --> 05:16.358
[gasps] Harley,
it's great to see you.

05:16.441 --> 05:17.984
Oh, Captain Boomerang.

05:18.109 --> 05:19.402
He knows his angles.

05:19.486 --> 05:21.279
Okay, so what's the plan?
We kicking his ass?

05:21.363 --> 05:23.615
I mean, it's Monday,
so he's probably
at bingo at the senior center.

05:23.698 --> 05:25.033
He loves a mature woman.

05:25.116 --> 05:26.451
Ugh, ew.

05:26.534 --> 05:28.244
We're just updating
our criminal database.

05:28.328 --> 05:31.456
Yeah, we can't
kick anyone's ass
until they actually do crimes.

05:31.581 --> 05:32.791
Oh, great, great, okay.

05:32.874 --> 05:34.584
What... What if we
go on Cleggslist,

05:34.668 --> 05:36.670
and post a job opportunity
for "murderer",

05:36.795 --> 05:38.505
then bash the skulls
of anyone who applies?

05:38.630 --> 05:39.964
We're heroes.

05:40.048 --> 05:42.634
We update records,
do paperwork and stay fit,

05:42.759 --> 05:45.387
until the computer
tells us there's a crime.

05:45.470 --> 05:46.805
Cool. Yeah, yeah.

05:46.888 --> 05:48.473
Um, how about while we do that,

05:48.556 --> 05:49.808
we get to know
each other better?

05:49.891 --> 05:51.433
You know,
my three biggest turn ons are--

05:51.518 --> 05:53.812
Harley, your frivolity
is not an asset here.

05:53.895 --> 05:56.147
Geez, sorry for trying
to get a vibe going.

05:56.231 --> 05:58.316
Ooh, now, that's good lighting.

05:58.400 --> 05:59.984
My skin looks slick as a...

06:00.110 --> 06:02.654
Sorry, I shouldn't say.
There are children present.

06:02.737 --> 06:04.614
...a pair of titties
at a car wash.

06:07.701 --> 06:10.995
You need to get the shades
or I'm gonna
photosynthesize everywhere.

06:11.121 --> 06:13.248
I did put in the request,
but I don't want
to get your hopes up.

06:13.331 --> 06:16.084
Because when I went
into the supply office,
the clerk says to me,

06:16.167 --> 06:19.754
all the Soviet era
dental clamps
and industrial-size funnels

06:19.838 --> 06:22.173
that I need for my plan to work
got checked out.

06:22.257 --> 06:23.800
Who else would need those?

06:23.883 --> 06:25.343
-Okay, I know
they're fucking with me.
-[door opens]

06:25.468 --> 06:28.346
Ugh, yes. At least I know
my outfit's here.

06:28.471 --> 06:30.306
See, I'm gonna
seize the oil rig

06:30.390 --> 06:34.394
in, like, a crisp 19th-century
British Royal Navy
Captain's uniform.

06:34.519 --> 06:37.188
Ooh, that's fresh as hell.

06:38.356 --> 06:40.692
"I'm a dumb boss."

06:40.817 --> 06:42.610
-I don't hate the bottoms.
-Great.

06:42.694 --> 06:46.531
Ugh, I mean, if this gaggle
of obtuse plebes

06:46.614 --> 06:47.782
keeps cockblocking me,

06:47.866 --> 06:49.117
I'm never gonna
get anything done.

06:49.200 --> 06:50.659
I might as well be
the CEO of nothing.

06:50.744 --> 06:52.620
Everything is just
like it was before.

06:52.704 --> 06:54.330
I'm doing it on my own,
yet again,

06:54.414 --> 06:55.749
just in a bigger office.

06:55.874 --> 06:57.334
Maybe you need to put
your oil plan on hold

06:57.417 --> 06:59.544
and disrupt the corporate
culture in this bitch first.

06:59.627 --> 07:02.589
No, I... I... I don't wanna
manage people.

07:02.714 --> 07:04.215
I just wanna do my--

07:05.550 --> 07:07.427
What the... Fuck you!

07:07.552 --> 07:09.304
-[cackling]
-[Poison Ivy sighs]

07:09.387 --> 07:11.222
I see your point.

07:11.306 --> 07:14.434
Did Harley end up
killing Sheryl Sandberg
in Jackson Hole last year,

07:14.559 --> 07:15.477
or did she survive?

07:15.560 --> 07:17.228
No, that was Andy Sandberg.

07:17.354 --> 07:18.563
Okay, perfect.

07:18.646 --> 07:19.898
I'm gonna spend
the next four hours

07:20.023 --> 07:22.067
numbing my brain
with idiotic Lean In TikTok.

07:22.150 --> 07:25.111
-[upbeat music playing]
-Ugh, this is so boring.

07:25.236 --> 07:28.531
Fighting crime is supposed
to be fun and dangerous
and sexy.

07:30.408 --> 07:31.951
Oh, my God, look!

07:32.077 --> 07:33.078
[all grunting]

07:33.161 --> 07:35.789
-What?
-Nightwing's a Hottest Hottie?

07:35.872 --> 07:37.791
-[Harley] "With rare flare
from his derriere..."
-[sighs]

07:37.874 --> 07:40.418
"Nightwing's radiant rump
has him flying in
at number two."

07:40.543 --> 07:42.253
Oh, I can't believe I know you!

07:42.379 --> 07:44.214
Do you have a publicist?
Is it Wonder Woman's publicist?

07:44.297 --> 07:46.508
God, this is so cool.
But what's with the pap shot?

07:46.591 --> 07:50.261
I won't degrade myself
going to a photo shoot
for that trash rag.

07:50.387 --> 07:51.554
[alarm blaring]

07:51.638 --> 07:53.431
Yes! A crime to solve.

07:53.556 --> 07:55.600
But you should consider getting
some tasteful nudes taken

07:55.725 --> 07:57.102
while you're
in peak physical form.

07:57.227 --> 07:58.895
Your grandchildren
will definitely want them.

07:58.978 --> 08:00.689
Okay, guys,
a dead body's been found.

08:00.772 --> 08:02.482
-We gotta go.
-Cool, a dead body.

08:02.607 --> 08:03.775
Not so fast.

08:03.858 --> 08:05.944
It's visitation day
at Blackgate.

08:06.027 --> 08:07.946
-And your papa awaits.
-[vehicle starts]

08:08.071 --> 08:11.074
-Ugh, I never
get to see dead people.
-[vehicle departs]

08:11.157 --> 08:12.325
[Harley] Ew, oh, my God.

08:12.450 --> 08:14.160
That's Mally Tomberson.

08:14.285 --> 08:16.621
-Who?
-The, ugh! Only a huge
Waynestagram model,

08:16.746 --> 08:18.665
and heiress
to the Old Gotham Corn Factory.

08:18.790 --> 08:22.043
Last night was the launch party
for her Hard Corn Water, hello?

08:22.127 --> 08:23.086
Hello. You mean whiskey?

08:23.169 --> 08:24.629
Legally, she can't
call it that.

08:24.754 --> 08:25.964
She explained it all
on her live stream.

08:26.047 --> 08:27.882
God, you guys
are so uncultured!

08:27.966 --> 08:30.593
So, do you look for DNA?
Dust for prints?
Seduce the bartender?

08:30.677 --> 08:32.178
[sighs] This cut's clean.

08:32.303 --> 08:34.304
The killer could have
a background in surgery.

08:34.431 --> 08:35.557
[earpieces beep]

08:35.640 --> 08:37.308
[gasps] Another body's
been found

08:37.392 --> 08:39.561
at the Hard Wayne's Gonna Fall
Ice Cream Pop-Up Experience.

08:39.644 --> 08:40.979
Ugh, I'll handle it.

08:41.062 --> 08:42.856
Should we send them
our ice cream orders?

08:42.938 --> 08:44.524
Everyone says
Childhood Trauma Swirl
is really good.

08:44.649 --> 08:45.817
[sighs]

08:47.152 --> 08:48.278
[door buzzing]

08:48.361 --> 08:50.530
[orchestral music playing]

08:54.492 --> 08:58.163
[Damian] Ew, this place
smells like a hamster cage.

08:58.288 --> 09:00.373
Oh, Mr. Pennyworth?
Young Master Damian?

09:00.498 --> 09:03.793
I'm afraid you won't be able
to visit Master Bruce today.

09:03.877 --> 09:06.463
So I missed the dead body
just to do absolutely nothing?

09:06.546 --> 09:08.923
"Master Bruce"? Who are you?

09:09.007 --> 09:11.134
Oh, I'm his butler, Alvin.

09:11.217 --> 09:12.594
But I'm his butler.

09:12.677 --> 09:14.137
Well, I'm his penal butler.

09:17.349 --> 09:19.684
I must insist on seeing
Master Bruce immediately.

09:19.809 --> 09:24.189
Oh, unfortunately,
his DJ lessons
are running a wee bit long.

09:24.314 --> 09:25.732
Now I must get back.

09:25.815 --> 09:27.734
We have a call with the CFO
of Wayne Enterprises.

09:27.859 --> 09:29.611
The stock prices
have leveled off.

09:29.694 --> 09:31.738
Hopefully, we can
avoid the trigger. [giggles]

09:31.863 --> 09:34.532
Uh, I'm sorry?
You're on a financial call?

09:34.657 --> 09:36.159
Oh, sweetie.

09:36.242 --> 09:39.496
He runs every
big decision by me.

09:39.579 --> 09:40.705
Ta-ta.

09:43.540 --> 09:45.460
Hmm.

09:45.543 --> 09:47.295
[Veronica Cale on phone]
The thing to remember
about managing people

09:47.379 --> 09:49.964
is they're inherently stupid,
needy and fragile,

09:50.048 --> 09:52.967
which means
they're easy to manipulate.

09:53.051 --> 09:56.763
Ugh, another ad?
Gotta get the pro account.

09:59.182 --> 10:00.100
Is that my scarf?

10:01.601 --> 10:03.019
-[Harley squeals]
-[Poison Ivy grunts]

10:03.103 --> 10:04.062
-[kissing]
-[giggles]

10:04.187 --> 10:05.897
Whoa, what's gotten into you?

10:05.980 --> 10:07.649
I got all horned up
at a crime scene today.

10:07.732 --> 10:09.067
You know what I think
would be superhot?

10:09.150 --> 10:10.402
Role playing.

10:10.485 --> 10:13.154
Okay, yeah, what, all right.
What do you have in mind?

10:13.238 --> 10:14.906
-Okay, you're a super-sexy
crime boss...
-Uh-huh.

10:15.031 --> 10:16.408
...and I am
a sexually-pushy cop

10:16.491 --> 10:18.451
who will cross any line
to get answers. [squeals]

10:18.576 --> 10:20.495
Okay, I like the sound of that.

10:20.578 --> 10:21.913
-Who is it?
-[Poison Ivy] Oh.

10:21.996 --> 10:23.415
Who in your circle of sickos
is a surgeon?

10:23.540 --> 10:25.250
Oh, eh, um...

10:25.333 --> 10:26.835
Dr. Big Boobs?

10:26.918 --> 10:28.753
No, not Dr. Big Boobs,
a real surgeon,

10:28.837 --> 10:30.588
one with a fetish
for amputation.

10:30.714 --> 10:32.257
Oh, sorry. Okay.

10:32.340 --> 10:33.591
Sor... Sorry, Officer.

10:33.675 --> 10:36.011
Um, it's Dr. Berkowitz.

10:36.094 --> 10:37.387
Not your dermatologist.

10:37.470 --> 10:39.389
God, the perp I'm tracking's
whereabouts

10:39.472 --> 10:41.599
are unaccounted for
from 1:00 to 2:00 a.m.
last night.

10:41.683 --> 10:43.059
Tell me who it is!

10:43.143 --> 10:44.853
-[sighs]
-What, you're not into this?

10:44.936 --> 10:47.105
Honey, are you trying
to get me to narc

10:47.230 --> 10:50.233
on one of my new co-workers
through sex stuff?

10:50.316 --> 10:52.068
Yes, I'm sorry.

10:52.152 --> 10:54.362
I really want to figure out
who did it so I can
impress the Bat Family.

10:54.446 --> 10:56.448
And I thought you could
just like, I don't know,
give me the answer?

10:56.531 --> 10:58.283
Babe, I can't.

10:58.408 --> 11:01.453
Listen, I don't even know
what half of those posers
are up to, anyway.

11:01.536 --> 11:03.955
They don't tell
their one true queen
their devilish schemes?

11:04.080 --> 11:05.915
Who's disrespecting you?
I will kill them!

11:05.999 --> 11:07.709
Oh, that's so sweet.

11:07.792 --> 11:09.419
-[cat meows]
-You know, if we're gonna
make our new jobs work,

11:09.502 --> 11:11.463
we do need to establish
some boundaries, right?

11:11.588 --> 11:12.839
Like, I'll handle my work thing

11:12.964 --> 11:14.132
so you don't have to
worry about that.

11:14.215 --> 11:15.717
I got some fresh ideas
already brewing.

11:15.800 --> 11:18.094
[gasps] I love when
you make your idea face.

11:18.178 --> 11:19.971
Okay, now I'm all
horned up again.

11:20.055 --> 11:22.640
How about you're
a super-sexy crime boss
who's had an annoying day,

11:22.766 --> 11:24.476
and I am your
sexually-pushy underling.

11:24.559 --> 11:27.645
Cater to my fragile male ego.
[giggling]

11:27.771 --> 11:30.648
-[chuckles]
-[both moan softly]

11:30.774 --> 11:34.694
Nope, he's dead, missing,
hates me, hate him,
dickhead, dead dickhead.

11:34.819 --> 11:36.988
-What happened to him?
Don't wanna know.
-[line dialing]

11:37.113 --> 11:39.574
-Oh, this guy.
-[Riddler on phone] You've
reached Riddler's voicemail.

11:39.657 --> 11:42.577
To leave a message,
you must solve a series
of intricate mind-bending--

11:42.660 --> 11:44.371
Ugh, he better be in a movie.

11:45.372 --> 11:48.165
Oh, right. He's dead too,
delete.

11:48.833 --> 11:50.043
[line dialing]

11:50.168 --> 11:51.711
[King Shark on phone]
Oh, hi, Harley.

11:51.836 --> 11:53.755
-King, you busy? Great.
-[King Shark] Well, actually--

11:53.838 --> 11:55.173
Do you know a villain
who loves hot models
and slicing limbs?

11:55.298 --> 11:56.883
I'm so sorry to cast
such a wide net.

11:57.008 --> 11:59.886
Oh, Harley!
Oh, you know I'm squeamish.

12:00.011 --> 12:01.805
I'm shocked
you called me about this.

12:01.888 --> 12:03.807
Well, no one else picked up.

12:03.890 --> 12:06.351
Well, you're a good guy now,
so your old friends
aren't gonna help you.

12:06.434 --> 12:08.311
[chuckles] Of course,
we're still pals,

12:08.395 --> 12:11.314
but I am changing
your name to "Potential Spam"
in my phone.

12:11.398 --> 12:14.401
I... I don't wanna
lose my standing
in the villain community.

12:14.526 --> 12:15.735
Ugh, those pussies.

12:15.860 --> 12:17.821
What, good guys
can't be amazing friends?

12:17.904 --> 12:20.198
-So, what you been up to?
-[cell phone dings]

12:20.281 --> 12:22.117
Well, Tabitha and I
are about to find out--

12:22.200 --> 12:23.535
Yeah. Sorry, King. I gotta go.

12:23.660 --> 12:25.578
Seven, eight, oh,
[chuckles] that's number nine.

12:25.704 --> 12:27.247
Nine healthy little sharks.

12:27.372 --> 12:29.374
Oh, I'm gonna need
to get a job.

12:30.500 --> 12:32.627
Vegan D-nuts on me, boys.

12:32.711 --> 12:35.296
-[Gorilla Grodd grunts]
-[Metallo] Nonplussed reaction.

12:35.380 --> 12:37.674
[Bane] Ooh,
maple leaf cinnamon.

12:37.757 --> 12:40.760
Look, guys, I... I got a lot
of appreciation for this team.

12:40.885 --> 12:42.762
And, uh, I get it.

12:42.887 --> 12:44.556
You know, you're at your job,
and suddenly there's, like,
this green lady,

12:44.639 --> 12:46.558
-like, all up in your business.
-[screeches]

12:46.683 --> 12:48.226
Totally hear that.

12:48.351 --> 12:50.437
And I just want
you guys to know
that I love feedback.

12:50.562 --> 12:54.441
So If you do have a crazy idea,
shoot it over.

12:54.566 --> 12:58.778
Ping it into my hear holes
and my door is always open.

12:58.903 --> 13:02.657
[Metallo] We knock down
city hall and build
a gladiator death ring.

13:02.741 --> 13:04.117
Bitching, am I right?

13:04.242 --> 13:06.453
Yeah, uh, totally bitching.

13:06.578 --> 13:09.039
I create a force field,
we fill it with hot babes.

13:09.122 --> 13:11.916
-And the cool thing is,
they have to go out with me.
-Right.

13:12.042 --> 13:15.670
Three words:
cocaine, zoo, disaster.

13:15.754 --> 13:16.880
-Okay.
-Wait, wait.

13:16.963 --> 13:18.423
I need three more words.

13:18.506 --> 13:21.551
Electric, eels, high.

13:22.594 --> 13:23.928
Ah, fuck.

13:24.012 --> 13:25.430
Basically, we give a bunch
of eels cocaine

13:25.555 --> 13:27.265
-and watch them
fuck up shit at the zoo.
-Huh.

13:27.390 --> 13:30.477
[Bane] I need 'splosives,
lots of 'splosives.

13:30.602 --> 13:33.772
-I wanna blow up a--
-This is great stuff.
I love this.

13:33.897 --> 13:35.815
Left the... The quantity empty,

13:35.940 --> 13:37.609
so just to go nuts there.

13:37.734 --> 13:40.945
[Bane] Whoa, I feel seen, ah.

13:41.071 --> 13:45.158
As I step away
for some highly cool
and important training,

13:45.283 --> 13:47.077
the people of Gotham
need not worry.

13:47.160 --> 13:49.954
You are in capable hands.
The Bat-Fam's

13:50.080 --> 13:52.165
got your back, fam.

13:54.084 --> 13:58.213
And that was supposed to be
a reassuring message
from Batman.

13:58.296 --> 14:00.924
But with the recent uptick
in mutilation murders,

14:01.007 --> 14:02.467
Gotham's left wondering,

14:02.592 --> 14:05.679
will we pay the price
for the Bat Family's failures?

14:05.804 --> 14:08.682
And will that price
be an arm or a leg?

14:08.807 --> 14:10.642
So, where were you last night?

14:10.767 --> 14:13.269
I told the story
a million times.

14:13.353 --> 14:15.480
I was out to dinner
at this new restaurant

14:15.605 --> 14:18.108
you'll never get into,
Bucket and Maup.

14:18.191 --> 14:19.984
Oh, my God. No, wait.

14:20.068 --> 14:23.113
That's where Martian Manhunter
and Grimes just got
in a huge fight.

14:23.196 --> 14:25.115
Mar-Man told Grimes
that he could never love her.

14:25.198 --> 14:28.118
And she threw
a bananas foster on his lap,
lighting his penis on fire.

14:28.201 --> 14:29.703
I was sitting
in the next booth.

14:29.828 --> 14:30.995
Aw, jealous.

14:31.079 --> 14:33.206
Don't be.
My own husband stood me up.

14:33.331 --> 14:36.835
The only way to get him
out of the house these days
is a celebrity golf tournament.

14:36.960 --> 14:38.461
Whatever. Fuck him.

14:38.545 --> 14:41.464
I was so bored
that I live streamed
the whole thing.

14:41.548 --> 14:42.549
[gasps] That's it.

14:42.674 --> 14:44.551
The other victims
were live streaming, too.

14:44.676 --> 14:47.303
That's how the killer
figures out where they are.

14:47.387 --> 14:49.139
Hey, uh,

14:49.222 --> 14:51.850
do you think they'll find
my clavicle in time
for the Hottest Hotties gala?

14:51.975 --> 14:54.310
-[Harley gasps]
-My dress is made
from ten live puppies,

14:54.394 --> 14:56.855
and every day I don't wear it,
they get less cute.

14:56.938 --> 15:00.150
[in nasal voice]
"Miss Macklewaithe has the most
beautiful clavicle in Gotham."

15:00.233 --> 15:01.192
Thank you so much.

15:01.317 --> 15:02.152
What's wrong with your voice?

15:02.235 --> 15:03.611
It's Professor Pyg!

15:03.695 --> 15:06.114
He's picking off
our city's Hottest Hotties.

15:06.197 --> 15:08.033
-Wait, what?
-I saw him at the newsstand.

15:08.158 --> 15:10.160
And he was drooling
all over Devorah's clavicle.

15:10.243 --> 15:11.327
It has got to be him.

15:11.411 --> 15:12.620
God, I am so good
at my new job.

15:12.704 --> 15:14.247
All the clues
are just drawn to me.

15:14.372 --> 15:16.124
[chuckles] Great work, Harley.

15:16.207 --> 15:17.542
Now we need to catch him.

15:17.667 --> 15:20.086
I have an idea,
and someone's gonna hate it.

15:22.881 --> 15:24.382
There's my girl.

15:24.466 --> 15:26.843
A clerk who knows how to work.
What's up, baby face?

15:26.926 --> 15:28.678
Oh, wow, Ivy.

15:28.762 --> 15:30.722
The guys in shipping
are gonna be pissed

15:30.805 --> 15:31.890
they missed you.

15:31.973 --> 15:32.891
You're the talk
of the basement.

15:32.974 --> 15:34.392
Love to hear it.

15:34.476 --> 15:38.271
I need, uh, uh, 20 goons,
dental clamps and funnels.

15:38.396 --> 15:42.692
Enough to channel about, like,
84 million gallons of oil
into the mouths of men.

15:42.776 --> 15:45.236
Ooh, pretty sure those
84 million gallons of oil

15:45.320 --> 15:47.614
are floating in the sea
as of about 20 minutes ago.

15:47.739 --> 15:49.657
What? What do you...
That's impossible.

15:49.741 --> 15:50.950
Oh, you didn't hear?

15:51.076 --> 15:53.036
Bane blew up an oil rig.
[chuckles]

15:53.119 --> 15:54.454
-[cell phone dings]
-It's so funny.

15:54.579 --> 15:55.705
I love Bane.

15:57.499 --> 15:58.583
[groans]

15:58.667 --> 16:01.294
Shit, shit, shit, shit!

16:01.419 --> 16:03.421
The fuck? I'm such a chump.

-[toilet flushes]
-[Ivy groans]

16:04.798 --> 16:06.925
[groans and grunts]

16:07.050 --> 16:08.051
'Sup, boss.

16:08.134 --> 16:09.386
Hey, what are you doing?

16:09.469 --> 16:10.762
You're in the executive women's
restroom.

16:10.887 --> 16:12.597
Never been a lady executive.

16:12.681 --> 16:16.059
So the boys deem this one
dumpers only.

16:16.142 --> 16:17.727
[door opens]

16:17.811 --> 16:20.438
Ivy, what are you doing
in the executive women's
restroom?

16:20.563 --> 16:22.273
I'm the executive woman here.

16:22.357 --> 16:24.317
Look at you! Whoo!

16:24.442 --> 16:26.194
Isn't this bathroom the tits?

16:26.277 --> 16:28.613
I come here when I pick up
my widow's benefits
checks from HR.

16:28.738 --> 16:31.199
-How are you?
-You know,
just reaching a career low,

16:31.282 --> 16:34.285
enabling overgrown goon babies
to destroy the world.

16:34.369 --> 16:36.746
You know, it's customary
to just say, "I'm good."

16:36.830 --> 16:38.289
Oh, you get to say
a long thing and I don't?

16:38.373 --> 16:40.000
Hey, I don't make the rules.

16:40.125 --> 16:42.836
Hey, not to pile on here,
but that stall's
out of shit tickets.

16:42.961 --> 16:44.254
Hey, Snowflake.

16:44.337 --> 16:46.715
Never interrupt two women
talking in the restroom.

16:46.798 --> 16:48.299
It's not Snowflake.

16:48.425 --> 16:49.592
-I am not Snowflake. Hey, stop.
-Bup-bup-bup-bup-bup!

16:49.676 --> 16:51.845
-Your fly's open.
-[Snowflame] Bitch.

16:51.970 --> 16:53.304
-Dickless prick.
-Ugh.

16:53.430 --> 16:56.182
Hey, Executive Woman,
cut the wallowing.

16:56.307 --> 16:57.684
Who cares
if you're a cool boss?

16:57.809 --> 16:59.811
You're not cool,
but you're Poison Ivy.

16:59.894 --> 17:02.856
Oh, [sighs] okay. Thanks.
I guess... I mean...

17:02.981 --> 17:07.152
Remember, you brought
a beautiful frozen woman
back to life

17:07.277 --> 17:08.819
with your weird science powers.

17:08.903 --> 17:11.489
You can do whatever you want
with the Legion of Doom.

17:11.573 --> 17:14.159
There is a place
for everyone else's opinions.

17:14.242 --> 17:16.327
And it's in that tiny,
waxy paper bag

17:16.453 --> 17:18.038
that's inside
that little metal mailbox

17:18.163 --> 17:19.830
in that stall
with my dirty tampons.

17:19.914 --> 17:21.833
You know what, you're right.

17:21.915 --> 17:26.003
Everyone can get on board
or they can fuck off
to that tiny tampon mailbox.

17:26.128 --> 17:27.672
There we go.

17:27.756 --> 17:29.591
Yeah, yeah. And you're not
supposed to be in here either.

17:29.674 --> 17:32.218
-[Nora] Love that.
-God, you're a bulldozer,
you know that?

17:32.344 --> 17:33.762
Do you want to be my assistant?

17:33.845 --> 17:35.680
Hmm, not really.

17:35.764 --> 17:37.182
Well, then, I'm gonna
have to change
the locks on this bathroom.

17:37.307 --> 17:39.017
I'll do it.

17:39.100 --> 17:41.019
I am Umberto Argento,

17:41.102 --> 17:44.189
the famous Italian photographer
without an accent.

17:44.272 --> 17:46.358
Where is the subject of my art?

17:46.483 --> 17:48.401
Ugh, again.
Why do I have to do this?

17:48.526 --> 17:52.030
Oh, we're live streaming
this Gotham Monthly photo shoot
to lure Pyg here.

17:52.155 --> 17:53.365
[Nightwing] I understand
the plan.

17:53.490 --> 17:55.909
Why do we have to actually
take the photos?

17:56.034 --> 17:59.287
If Pyg shows up
and we're just holding
each other's fucking nutsacks,

17:59.371 --> 18:00.622
he'll know it's a trap.

18:00.705 --> 18:02.082
Now, let's get
that ass to clap, baby.

18:02.207 --> 18:04.000
[chuckles] Hey,
I finally did it.

18:04.084 --> 18:08.588
I gave Gotham Magazine
the exclusive on my, ugh,
juicy caboosey.

18:08.713 --> 18:10.048
Oh, yeah.

18:10.131 --> 18:12.884
You're three spritzes deep
and it's sunset on the Rialto,

18:12.967 --> 18:14.844
when your love calls your name.

18:14.928 --> 18:16.012
Turn around and smolder.

18:16.096 --> 18:17.681
I said smolder! Gorgeous.

18:17.764 --> 18:20.225
Okay, now you've lost your job
with the olive oil factory,

18:20.350 --> 18:21.768
and mama tries to comfort you,

18:21.893 --> 18:23.812
pulling you
into her ample bosom.

18:23.895 --> 18:25.689
Okay, now serve me young coed

18:25.772 --> 18:27.982
studying in Naples
for the summer. Yes!

18:28.066 --> 18:29.234
[messages beeping]

18:29.317 --> 18:31.069
All right,
where's the dead body?

18:31.194 --> 18:32.946
-[Harley gasps]
-[Robin] Oh, come on.

18:33.071 --> 18:34.906
-[Batgirl] Were the lights
supposed to go out?
-[Harley gasps]

18:34.989 --> 18:37.158
Feels like someone's
about to make
their big entrance, huh?

18:37.242 --> 18:38.660
[Batgirl] I'll find
the generator.

18:38.743 --> 18:41.287
[grunting] Almost got it.
There.

18:41.413 --> 18:42.706
[laughing maniacally]

18:42.789 --> 18:43.748
-[Batgirl] Professor Pyg?
-[Harley] Nightwing?

18:43.832 --> 18:44.582
Not cool, dude.

18:49.129 --> 18:53.049
Okay. Everyone's plans,
schemes, plots, on the table.

18:53.133 --> 18:54.551
[device vibrating]

18:56.261 --> 18:59.222
-[Metallo] I already rented
a wood chipper.
-[all clamoring]

18:59.305 --> 19:00.724
Uh-uh-uh.

19:00.807 --> 19:03.143
No more blowing up shit
and pathetic cash grabs

19:03.268 --> 19:06.104
and problematic ways
to date hot babes.

19:06.187 --> 19:07.397
So played out, done.

19:07.480 --> 19:11.026
Basic as AF. Mm-mm-mm.

19:11.109 --> 19:12.402
[Poison Ivy] And from now on,

19:12.485 --> 19:15.405
everyone's working together
on my stuff.

19:15.488 --> 19:17.282
Socially conscious evil.

19:17.365 --> 19:20.118
Anything that isn't
a part of that
is not gonna happen.

19:20.201 --> 19:21.828
Okay? All my shit,
all day long.

19:21.953 --> 19:24.622
We're not gonna
let this bullshit happen!

19:24.706 --> 19:27.459
This is racist against men.

19:28.126 --> 19:30.170
[grunts and roars]

19:31.338 --> 19:33.173
[all clamoring]

19:48.313 --> 19:50.148
What's with the raggedy-ass
Andy's?

19:50.273 --> 19:52.984
They're Dollotrons.
Poor, lost souls brainwashed
to do Pyg's bidding.

19:53.109 --> 19:54.527
I wish we could help-- Ugh!

19:54.652 --> 19:56.613
Gross, don't touch me.

19:56.696 --> 19:57.947
[Robin grunting]

20:00.158 --> 20:02.702
[yells and grunts]

20:02.827 --> 20:03.745
[screeches]

20:03.828 --> 20:05.330
[Nora] Get him!

20:05.455 --> 20:07.415
[Metallo] She's not
the boss of me.

20:07.499 --> 20:10.085
-[Nora] Ooh, watch out.
-[Poison Ivy grunts]

20:10.168 --> 20:12.545
-[roaring]
-[Poison Ivy grunting]

20:12.671 --> 20:16.341
Yeah, rip his fucking
arm off, Ivy!

20:16.424 --> 20:18.051
[Gorilla Grodd and Poison Ivy
grunting]

20:18.176 --> 20:19.928
Do you think I'm scared of you?

20:22.305 --> 20:23.348
[grunts]

20:23.473 --> 20:24.516
-[laughs]
-[Nora] You go, boss!

20:24.641 --> 20:26.851
[Nora] Ooh, ooh,
ooh, ooh, yes!

20:26.935 --> 20:28.269
[Snowflame screams]

20:29.562 --> 20:31.731
-[Batgirl grunts]
-[slashing]

20:31.856 --> 20:33.441
[Harley grunts]
This is all my fault.

20:33.525 --> 20:35.360
I have to save Nightwing.

20:35.860 --> 20:37.696
[grunting]

20:42.200 --> 20:45.370
[Metallo] Oh, no. My system
seems to be malfunctioning.

20:45.495 --> 20:47.580
Zeep, zap, spark, spark.

20:47.706 --> 20:50.417
[grunts] I don't think so,
you tin cunt.

20:50.542 --> 20:52.377
Wow. [grunts] Ow.

20:52.460 --> 20:55.422
Ow, ow, ow.

20:55.547 --> 20:57.424
[screaming]

20:57.924 --> 20:59.384
Ahhh!

20:59.509 --> 21:00.802
You'll never beat me.

21:00.885 --> 21:02.137
[stomach rumbling]

21:02.220 --> 21:04.639
Oh, God, the vegan doughnuts.
[farts and retches]

21:04.723 --> 21:06.933
[Bane] Sorry,
my landlord called.

21:07.058 --> 21:11.146
He's finally going to put in
a carbon monoxide detector.

21:11.229 --> 21:14.232
Whoa, what happened here?

21:14.357 --> 21:16.568
Hey, Bane.
Your next big evil plot

21:16.651 --> 21:19.654
is to clean up a shitload
of oil from Gotham Harbor.

21:19.738 --> 21:22.323
[Bane] But I just
'sploded that oil!

21:23.658 --> 21:25.702
I'll get a bucket.

21:25.785 --> 21:29.789
What's the perfect human
without a perfect bootay?

21:29.914 --> 21:34.961
My creation is mere moments
from being realized.

21:35.045 --> 21:37.756
Holy shit! A hot Dollotron?

21:37.881 --> 21:38.965
Harley! Yes!

21:39.090 --> 21:41.134
I love my ass. Okay,
I admit it. Now, help me.

21:41.259 --> 21:43.094
I knew you cared.

21:43.219 --> 21:44.471
Drop the scalpel, Pyg!

21:44.596 --> 21:47.182
My coworker's wild,
perfect-party ass

21:47.265 --> 21:48.975
does not belong
on a flesh doll.

21:49.100 --> 21:50.560
It, honestly,
it belongs in a museum.

21:50.643 --> 21:53.772
Too late.
This rump is a singular beauty,

21:53.855 --> 21:56.441
-and it's time to cut the cake.
-[Nightwing] No, no.

21:56.566 --> 21:59.194
[grunts] Got you!

21:59.277 --> 22:00.779
-[Professor Pyg] Ah.
-[yells]

22:00.904 --> 22:01.946
[both grunting]

22:02.030 --> 22:04.032
It's gonna take a lot
more than some--

22:04.115 --> 22:07.243
[both grunting]

22:07.327 --> 22:09.704
-[pounding]
-[Harley grunting]

22:09.788 --> 22:12.290
Well, looks like
I saved your ass.

22:12.415 --> 22:15.085
-[Nightwing] What...
You killed him?
-Oh, my God, is he dead?

22:15.168 --> 22:17.003
Cool.

22:17.128 --> 22:20.632
Ivy has pledged
to take the Legion
in a green-conscious direction,

22:20.715 --> 22:23.009
which sent LexCorp
stocks soaring.

22:23.134 --> 22:25.303
The same can't be said
for Wayne Enterprises,

22:25.387 --> 22:29.099
whose stocks
are in a free fall
after the news.

22:29.182 --> 22:30.350
We've hit the trigger.

22:30.475 --> 22:31.601
Fuel up the jet.

22:31.685 --> 22:33.395
I'm going to Gotham.

22:33.478 --> 22:35.647
[theme music playing]
