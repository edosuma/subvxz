00:24.649 --> 00:26.891
Report, Mr. Chekov.

00:27.068 --> 00:30.235
Full scan. Results negative.

00:30.405 --> 00:32.064
Radiation level normal.

00:32.240 --> 00:35.241
Atmosphere and terrain
are undisturbed.

00:35.410 --> 00:38.245
No evidence of a colony
nor any residual after-effect

00:38.413 --> 00:40.489
of a force that might have
annihilated it.

00:40.957 --> 00:42.996
- Life readings, Dr. McCoy.
- Nothing.

00:43.167 --> 00:45.409
Said they were being attacked
by an unidentified ship.

00:45.587 --> 00:48.338
Which we were unable
to detect upon approach.

00:48.506 --> 00:51.460
An entire human colony,

00:53.010 --> 00:55.336
a whole settlement,

00:55.513 --> 00:58.549
100 men, women and children.

00:59.225 --> 01:00.885
Who did it?

01:01.060 --> 01:02.851
And why?

01:04.855 --> 01:06.895
- Kirk here.
- Spock here, captain.

01:07.066 --> 01:10.435
Sensors have picked up
a Klingon ship, closing fast.

01:11.862 --> 01:14.353
Deflectors on, condition red.
Protect yourselves.

01:14.532 --> 01:16.939
Total reply if attacked.

01:17.117 --> 01:19.525
So that's the answer. Klingons.

01:19.703 --> 01:21.447
Trouble aboard the Klingon ship.

01:21.622 --> 01:25.572
Evidence of explosions,
massive destruction.

01:32.216 --> 01:36.794
Captain, the enemy ship is drifting,
totally disabled.

01:37.262 --> 01:40.631
- And we never fired upon it.
- Maintain red alert.

01:46.313 --> 01:48.982
You attacked my ship.

01:49.149 --> 01:51.687
Four hundred of my crew dead.

01:52.610 --> 01:57.153
Kirk, my ship is disabled.
I claim yours.

01:57.323 --> 01:59.316
You are now prisoners
of the Klingon Empire

01:59.492 --> 02:02.279
against which you have committed
a wanton act of war.

02:17.260 --> 02:21.008
Space, the final frontier.

02:26.185 --> 02:30.348
These are the voyages
of the starship Enterprise.

02:30.523 --> 02:34.520
Its five-year mission:
To explore strange new worlds,

02:34.693 --> 02:38.477
to seek out new life
and new civilisations,

02:38.656 --> 02:42.321
to boldly go where no man
has gone before.

03:26.995 --> 03:28.275
For three years...

03:28.454 --> 03:31.870
...the Federation and the Klingon
Empire have been at peace.

03:33.334 --> 03:35.077
A treaty we have honoured
to the letter.

03:35.253 --> 03:38.586
We took no action
against your ship, Kang.

03:38.756 --> 03:41.377
Were the screams
of my crew imaginary?

03:41.550 --> 03:43.258
What were your orders, Kirk?

03:43.427 --> 03:45.384
To start a war? You've succeeded.

03:45.554 --> 03:48.425
Test a new weapon?
We shall be happy to examine it.

03:48.599 --> 03:51.268
There was a Federation colony
on this planet. It was destroyed.

03:51.435 --> 03:52.514
By what?

03:52.686 --> 03:57.644
No bodies, no ruins.
A colony of the invisible?

03:57.816 --> 04:01.481
Yes, the test of a new Klingon weapon,
leaving no traces.

04:02.696 --> 04:06.776
Federation ships don't specialise
in sneak attacks.

04:07.868 --> 04:10.323
We have wondered
when you would begin.

04:10.496 --> 04:14.161
You lured my ship into ambush
by a false Klingon distress call.

04:14.333 --> 04:16.456
You will tell us why
with the proper persuasion.

04:16.627 --> 04:19.579
You received a distress call?
We received a distress call.

04:19.755 --> 04:22.292
I don't propose
to spend the rest of my life

04:22.466 --> 04:25.301
on this ball of dust
arguing your fantasies.

04:25.469 --> 04:26.927
The Enterprise is mine.

04:29.764 --> 04:32.220
Instruct your transporter room
to beam us aboard.

04:37.814 --> 04:38.893
Go to the devil.

04:42.026 --> 04:45.111
We have no devil, Kirk.

04:46.322 --> 04:48.778
But we understand
the habits of yours.

04:52.120 --> 04:56.449
I shall torture you to death,

04:56.624 --> 04:58.830
one by one,

05:00.336 --> 05:03.787
until your noble captain
cries, "Enough."

05:06.801 --> 05:08.259
Who will be first?

05:19.396 --> 05:20.511
Cossacks!

05:21.857 --> 05:24.182
Filthy Klingon murderers!

05:24.860 --> 05:27.018
You killed my brother, Piotr.

05:27.988 --> 05:30.146
The Archanis IV research outpost.

05:30.324 --> 05:32.565
A hundred peaceful
people massacred!

05:33.619 --> 05:35.492
Just like you did here.

05:35.662 --> 05:37.287
My brother...

05:37.456 --> 05:39.282
- My brother.
- And you volunteer to join him.

05:39.458 --> 05:41.830
That is loyalty.

05:49.134 --> 05:50.213
Chekov!

05:54.889 --> 05:56.218
Stop the torture.

06:01.396 --> 06:03.554
Jim, you can't
hand over the Enterprise.

06:04.190 --> 06:06.099
Help Chekov.

06:08.403 --> 06:09.980
Don't plan any tricks, Kirk.

06:10.154 --> 06:14.650
I will kill 100 hostages
at the first sign of treachery.

06:16.244 --> 06:19.494
I'll beam you aboard the Enterprise.
Once there, no tricks.

06:26.671 --> 06:31.582
Captain, you can't.
Don't let these animals have the ship.

06:35.804 --> 06:39.423
- Move aside.
- Animals?

06:39.600 --> 06:42.720
Your captain crawls like one.

06:42.895 --> 06:45.267
A Klingon
would never have surrendered.

06:45.439 --> 06:48.191
Order everybody in this area
to be transported up.

06:48.358 --> 06:50.932
All weapons on him.

06:56.742 --> 07:00.656
- Kirk to Enterprise. Mr. Spock.
- Here, captain.

07:01.538 --> 07:03.744
Mr. Spock, we have guests.

07:03.915 --> 07:05.742
Adjust transporter to wide field.

07:05.917 --> 07:10.164
Beam up everyone in the target area.

07:17.971 --> 07:20.722
Understood, captain.

07:20.890 --> 07:22.266
Transporter room.

07:42.203 --> 07:44.694
Call Security, Johnson,
on the double.

07:44.872 --> 07:46.247
- Good work, Spock.
- What happened?

07:46.415 --> 07:47.993
Our landing party is intact, doctor.

07:48.167 --> 07:49.958
All others suspended in transit.

07:50.127 --> 07:52.452
- Who are the guests, by the way?
- Klingons.

07:52.630 --> 07:54.871
Well, they're right in here.

07:55.049 --> 07:57.125
- Johnson?
- Security men on the way, sir.

07:57.301 --> 08:00.800
Captain, leave them where they are,
non-existence.

08:00.971 --> 08:04.422
That's so many less
Klingon monsters in the galaxy.

08:07.436 --> 08:09.345
Bring them in.

08:19.990 --> 08:22.196
Move them out. Move.

08:24.035 --> 08:27.654
- Liar.
- I said no tricks after we reach the ship.

08:28.373 --> 08:30.200
You're a prisoner
of the Federation of Planets

08:30.375 --> 08:33.744
against which you may or may not
have committed an act of war.

08:33.919 --> 08:36.078
There are still survivors
aboard my ship.

08:36.256 --> 08:39.006
Captain, we've not be able
to get through to Starfleet Command.

08:39.174 --> 08:41.381
All subspace frequencies
have been blocked.

08:41.553 --> 08:44.589
And there's too much radiation
coming from that Klingon ship.

08:44.764 --> 08:47.551
- It's a hazard to the vicinity.
- Prepare to destruct.

08:47.725 --> 08:49.967
Completing the job you started?

08:50.144 --> 08:51.769
You wouldn't be standing here
if I had.

08:51.938 --> 08:54.393
First group
from the Klingon vessel, captain.

09:02.740 --> 09:05.527
My wife, Mara,
and my science officer.

09:07.620 --> 09:09.363
Kang, what has happened?

09:09.538 --> 09:11.614
More Federation treachery.

09:11.791 --> 09:14.079
We are prisoners.

09:14.251 --> 09:16.291
What will they do to us?

09:16.462 --> 09:19.628
I've heard of their atrocities,
their death camps.

09:20.466 --> 09:23.917
They will torture us for our
scientific and military information.

09:24.094 --> 09:25.802
Apparently you have things
to learn about us.

09:25.971 --> 09:27.596
Contain them in the crew lounge.

09:27.765 --> 09:30.552
Programme the food synthesizer
to accommodate our guests.

09:30.726 --> 09:32.386
You'll be well treated, Kang.

09:32.895 --> 09:35.101
So I have seen.

09:39.776 --> 09:41.650
Secure from red alert.

09:43.780 --> 09:46.615
But maintain general quarters.
Scan this sector for other ships.

09:46.783 --> 09:49.618
Run a full check on the colony,
I want this thing nailed down fast.

09:49.786 --> 09:52.324
We know what happened,
a distress call.

09:52.497 --> 09:54.454
At the moment we received
the distress signal

09:54.624 --> 09:56.617
from the colony on Beta 12A,

09:56.793 --> 10:00.458
the Klingons were too far distant
to have been the attackers.

10:00.630 --> 10:05.873
Moreover, they also were
apparently attracted by a distress call.

10:09.472 --> 10:12.923
Lies. They want to start a war
by pretending that we did.

10:13.101 --> 10:14.725
Chekov may be right.

10:14.894 --> 10:16.721
The Klingons claim
to have honoured the truce

10:16.896 --> 10:18.972
but there have been incidents,
raids on our outposts.

10:19.148 --> 10:21.022
No proof
that the Klingons committed it.

10:21.192 --> 10:23.019
What proof do we need?

10:23.194 --> 10:25.981
We know what a Klingon is.

10:32.828 --> 10:36.327
Our log tapes will indicate
our innocence in the present situation.

10:36.498 --> 10:40.496
Unfortunately, there's no guarantee
that they'll be believed.

10:45.340 --> 10:46.585
Report.

10:46.759 --> 10:48.668
Still no contact
with Starfleet Command, sir.

10:48.844 --> 10:50.338
Outside communications blanketed.

10:50.512 --> 10:52.884
Keep trying.
We've got a diplomatic tiger by the tail.

10:53.056 --> 10:56.223
Transporter room to Bridge.
Klingon ship has vacated, sir.

10:56.393 --> 10:57.804
Very good, Scotty. Mr. Sulu?

10:57.978 --> 11:01.263
- Phasers locked and ready to fire.
- Fire phasers.

11:08.697 --> 11:11.781
Sensor sweeps reveal
no other ships within range, captain.

11:11.950 --> 11:14.904
- Lieutenant Uhura?
- No contact with Starfleet as yet, sir.

11:15.078 --> 11:18.447
Mr. Sulu, change course to 17,
mark 4, warp factor 3.

11:18.623 --> 11:20.283
Warp factor 3, sir.

11:43.230 --> 11:44.890
When I take this ship,

11:45.066 --> 11:47.770
I'll have Kirk's head stuffed
and hung on his cabin wall.

11:47.943 --> 11:50.269
- They will kill us before we can act.
- No.

11:50.446 --> 11:54.230
They wish to question us,
learn our strength, our plans.

11:54.408 --> 11:59.117
- They never will.
- We are 40 against 400.

11:59.288 --> 12:03.582
Four thousand throats may be cut
in one night by a running man.

12:03.751 --> 12:06.621
Patience, vigilance.

12:06.795 --> 12:09.333
They will make their mistake.

12:09.506 --> 12:13.670
The captain of the Enterprise will give
us knowledge to end this war quickly.

12:22.352 --> 12:24.096
Captain.

12:27.065 --> 12:28.892
This doesn't make sense.

12:29.067 --> 12:31.640
Carriers are normal,
channels are open,

12:31.820 --> 12:33.100
and still no outside contact.

12:33.279 --> 12:34.359
I don't understand it, sir.

12:34.531 --> 12:37.235
Could the Klingons
be doing something?

12:45.917 --> 12:49.535
- Sulu?
- Change in course. Accelerating.

12:49.712 --> 12:51.752
Helm dead.

12:52.965 --> 12:54.673
Auxiliary navigation dead.

12:54.842 --> 12:56.669
Override.

12:57.845 --> 13:00.134
Nothing responds, captain.

13:09.190 --> 13:12.060
- Scotty, stop all engines.
- I would if I could, sir,

13:12.735 --> 13:16.946
but my controls have gone crazy.
Something's taken over.

13:17.990 --> 13:19.532
- Scotty.
- The engines, sir,

13:19.700 --> 13:21.324
they've gone to warp 9.

13:21.493 --> 13:22.822
By themselves.

13:23.912 --> 13:27.661
- New course?
- Nine-oh-two, mark 5.

13:27.833 --> 13:29.457
That'll take us out of the galaxy.

13:36.508 --> 13:37.623
Captain.

13:37.801 --> 13:39.509
Reports coming in
from the lower decks.

13:39.678 --> 13:41.754
Emergency bulkheads have closed.

13:41.930 --> 13:45.513
Almost 400 crewmen
are trapped down there, sir.

13:52.524 --> 13:55.015
Most interesting.

13:55.193 --> 13:57.269
The bulk of your crew trapped,

13:57.445 --> 14:00.861
your ship racing from this galaxy
at wild speeds.

14:01.032 --> 14:02.657
Delightful.

14:02.826 --> 14:06.906
How did I perform this sabotage, Kirk?
All my men are here.

14:07.080 --> 14:11.160
Johnson. Get down to Security.
Search every section.

14:11.334 --> 14:14.039
Some Klingons may have beamed
aboard undetected from the ship.

14:14.212 --> 14:17.047
And get down to Engineering, help
Scotty hammer things back to normal

14:17.215 --> 14:19.338
and free those trapped crewmen.

14:19.509 --> 14:23.886
And before I put you in the brig,
there's a little something I owe you.

14:36.358 --> 14:38.185
Phasers.

15:03.260 --> 15:06.426
Stand and fight, you cowards.

15:20.777 --> 15:22.604
Sickbay.

15:34.207 --> 15:35.915
Bridge.

15:43.090 --> 15:45.877
The Klingons are free, armed
as we are. They'll try and take the ship.

15:46.052 --> 15:47.297
Scotty, how many men do we have?

15:47.470 --> 15:49.462
Three hundred and ninety-two
trapped below decks.

15:49.638 --> 15:52.758
Deploy forces to protect your section
and the Auxiliary Control Centre.

15:52.933 --> 15:55.934
Check the armoury and try and free
those trapped crewmen.

15:56.103 --> 15:58.808
The doors and bulkheads won't budge,
we'll have to cut through.

15:58.981 --> 16:01.436
Blow out the bulkheads if you have to.
We need numbers.

16:01.608 --> 16:03.566
What luck have you had
controlling the speed?

16:03.736 --> 16:06.690
No, sir. She's a projectile, at warp 9.

16:06.864 --> 16:08.655
And don't ask me
what's holding her together.

16:08.824 --> 16:10.615
Five-minute reports, Scotty.
Kirk out.

16:10.784 --> 16:11.947
Full sensor scan of the ship.

16:12.119 --> 16:14.824
Report on any movement
by the Klingons.

16:14.997 --> 16:17.120
The Klingon Empire has
maintained a duelling tradition,

16:17.291 --> 16:18.749
I think they can beat us with swords.

16:18.917 --> 16:23.828
Neither the Klingon technology,
nor ours, is capable of this.

16:24.005 --> 16:26.876
The instantaneous
transmutation of matter.

16:27.050 --> 16:28.330
I doubt they are responsible.

16:28.510 --> 16:30.668
Any other logical candidate?

16:30.845 --> 16:34.546
None.
However, if they had such power,

16:34.724 --> 16:38.010
would they not have used it
to create more effective weapons?

16:38.186 --> 16:41.471
And only for themselves?

16:42.774 --> 16:45.312
Mr. Sulu, get below.

16:45.485 --> 16:47.608
Take command of Engineering

16:47.779 --> 16:49.154
- and Auxiliary Control.
- Aye, sir.

16:49.322 --> 16:51.314
- Captain.
- Mr. Chekov?

16:51.491 --> 16:53.448
- Captain.
- Mr. Chekov, as you were.

16:53.618 --> 16:55.361
- Chekov!
- Sir.

16:55.536 --> 16:57.529
Let me go too.

16:57.705 --> 16:59.781
I've got a personal score
to settle with the Klingons.

16:59.957 --> 17:02.365
This is no time for a vendetta.
Maintain your post.

17:02.543 --> 17:04.583
- Captain.
- Chekov, maintain your post.

17:04.753 --> 17:07.589
Don't try to stop me, captain.

17:07.882 --> 17:09.874
I saw what they left of Piotr.

17:10.885 --> 17:14.752
I swore on his grave
I would avenge his murder.

17:21.686 --> 17:25.471
What's Chekov's grudge
against the Klingons? Who's Piotr?

17:25.941 --> 17:27.934
His only brother,
killed in a Klingon raid.

17:28.735 --> 17:30.064
His brother?

17:30.237 --> 17:32.942
He never had a brother.
He's an only child.

17:33.115 --> 17:35.606
- Sulu, get down to Engineering.
- Aye, sir.

17:36.201 --> 17:37.695
Security, this is the captain.

17:37.869 --> 17:40.906
Find Mr. Chekov
and bring him to the Bridge.

17:41.081 --> 17:43.536
Captain, why would..?

17:43.708 --> 17:46.745
Why would Chekov
believe he has a brother?

17:46.920 --> 17:48.877
I don't know.

17:49.047 --> 17:51.004
But he does.

17:51.174 --> 17:55.753
And now he wants revenge
for a non-existent loss.

18:08.232 --> 18:09.940
There.

18:11.611 --> 18:14.695
Those filthy butchers.

18:14.864 --> 18:16.442
There are rules, even in war.

18:16.616 --> 18:19.782
You don't keep hacking at a man
after he's down.

18:19.952 --> 18:22.574
Hand me that numanol capsule.

18:50.941 --> 18:54.440
Layout and specifications
of the Enterprise, commander.

18:54.987 --> 18:57.110
Enemy numbers
are the same as ours.

18:57.281 --> 19:00.400
- We have a fighting balance.
- Then we take this ship.

19:00.575 --> 19:02.698
This ship that is headed towards
the end of the galaxy?

19:02.869 --> 19:05.325
In time. In time.

19:05.497 --> 19:08.866
We must take these sections.
First, Engineering.

19:09.918 --> 19:12.491
- Kirk here.
- Scott here, sir.

19:12.671 --> 19:15.506
There's no use trying
to free those men down below.

19:15.674 --> 19:18.840
The phaser torches,
they won't cut through the bulkheads,

19:19.010 --> 19:20.919
nor the doors, nor the decks.

19:21.095 --> 19:22.673
Something happened to the metal.

19:22.847 --> 19:25.516
- What about the armoury?
- Well, I'm there now, sir.

19:25.683 --> 19:29.728
And you never saw such a fine
collection of antiques in your life.

19:31.939 --> 19:36.317
Get back to Engineering,
try and re-establish engine control.

19:36.486 --> 19:39.403
And talk to Ordnance about
manufacturing phaser replacements.

19:39.572 --> 19:41.196
Aye, sir.

19:45.536 --> 19:48.323
A claymore.

19:52.209 --> 19:55.210
You're a beauty.

19:59.550 --> 20:01.922
What the blazes is going on?

20:02.094 --> 20:05.677
Scans indicate that our forces
and those of the Klingons

20:05.848 --> 20:08.884
are exactly equal at 38 each.

20:09.059 --> 20:13.472
The Klingons control Deck 6
and Starboard Deck 7

20:13.647 --> 20:17.182
while we control all sections above.

20:18.235 --> 20:19.812
Constant surveillance, Mr. Spock.

20:19.986 --> 20:21.529
- Most curious, captain.
- What?

20:21.697 --> 20:24.152
There appear to be more
life energy units on board

20:24.324 --> 20:25.355
than can be accounted for

20:25.534 --> 20:28.618
by the presence of the Enterprise crew
plus the Klingons.

20:28.954 --> 20:30.614
A considerable discrepancy.

20:30.789 --> 20:33.114
Could more Klingons
have beamed aboard?

20:33.291 --> 20:37.419
I shall attempt a compensatory reading
of Klingon units.

20:54.645 --> 20:56.852
Any signs of those devils, Mr. Sulu?

20:57.023 --> 20:59.146
All clear, Mr. Scott.

21:28.887 --> 21:30.429
They've taken Engineering.

21:30.597 --> 21:32.471
I don't know how many more
Klingons are around,

21:32.641 --> 21:34.847
but we'll split up
and try to make it back to the Bridge.

21:35.018 --> 21:36.596
Aye.

21:44.945 --> 21:47.151
Victory!

21:48.156 --> 21:49.567
Victory!

21:49.741 --> 21:52.991
No additional Klingons detected,
captain.

21:53.161 --> 21:57.289
It is an alien life force, a single entity.

21:58.291 --> 22:01.209
I cannot ascertain its location.

22:01.377 --> 22:04.996
An alien life force.

22:05.506 --> 22:09.753
We must make contact,
find out what it wants.

22:10.345 --> 22:15.006
Readings being diverted
to the library computer for analysis.

22:15.183 --> 22:16.297
Computer report.

22:16.934 --> 22:22.177
Alien life force onboard is composed
of pure energy, type unknown.

22:22.356 --> 22:25.191
Actions indicate intelligence
and purpose.

22:25.359 --> 22:27.399
What purpose?

22:27.570 --> 22:32.030
Insufficient data for further analysis.

22:34.618 --> 22:37.453
A brother that never existed,
a phantom colony,

22:37.621 --> 22:42.579
imaginary distress calls,
the creation of these weapons.

22:42.751 --> 22:46.452
Do you sense a pattern, Mr. Spock?

22:47.256 --> 22:50.043
If the alien is creating
these events, captain,

22:50.217 --> 22:54.713
it is apparently capable
of manipulating matter and mind.

22:55.305 --> 22:57.132
And now it has control
of the Enterprise,

22:57.307 --> 23:00.142
and taking us out of the galaxy.

23:00.310 --> 23:03.761
- But why?
- I am constrained to point out,

23:03.939 --> 23:06.643
that since minds
are evidently being influenced,

23:06.817 --> 23:08.975
we cannot know at this moment

23:09.152 --> 23:12.568
whether our own memories
are completely accurate and true.

23:12.739 --> 23:16.155
We must talk to Kang.
Bury the hatchet.

23:16.326 --> 23:18.200
An appropriate choice of terms,
captain.

23:18.703 --> 23:22.831
However, it is notoriously difficult
to arrange a truce with the Klingons

23:22.999 --> 23:24.742
once blood has been drawn.

23:24.918 --> 23:27.872
A truce? Are you serious?

23:28.046 --> 23:31.249
I've got men in Sickbay,
some of them dying,

23:31.424 --> 23:33.547
atrocities committed
on their persons.

23:33.718 --> 23:36.885
And you talk about making peace
with these fiends?

23:37.054 --> 23:39.296
Why, if our backs were turned
they'd jump us in a minute.

23:39.473 --> 23:42.344
And you know what Klingons
do to prisoners.

23:42.518 --> 23:45.305
Slave labour, death planets,
experiments.

23:45.479 --> 23:46.890
- McCoy?
- While you're talking,

23:47.064 --> 23:48.262
they're planning attacks.

23:48.441 --> 23:49.935
This is a fight to the death.

23:50.109 --> 23:52.018
We'd better start trying to win it.

23:52.194 --> 23:54.270
We are attempting to end it, doctor.

23:54.446 --> 23:56.605
By reason, preferably.

23:56.782 --> 23:59.902
There is an alien onboard
which may have created the situation.

24:00.077 --> 24:03.493
Who cares what started it, Mr. Spock?
We're in it.

24:03.664 --> 24:06.581
Those murderers.
We should wipe out every one of them.

24:06.750 --> 24:10.962
The alien is the real threat,
that's the enemy we have to wipe out.

24:11.713 --> 24:13.421
Sickbay calling, doctor.

24:13.590 --> 24:15.962
There are more wounded men
requiring your attention.

24:21.640 --> 24:22.838
How many more men must die

24:23.016 --> 24:28.686
before you two begin to act
like military men instead of fools?

24:38.156 --> 24:39.734
Kirk here.

24:41.951 --> 24:43.031
This is Kang.

24:43.203 --> 24:45.575
Kang, there's something important
I must discuss with you.

24:45.747 --> 24:48.950
I have captured
your Engineering section.

24:49.125 --> 24:52.826
I now control the ship's power
and life-support systems.

24:53.004 --> 24:57.464
I have deprived all areas
except our own.

24:57.633 --> 25:01.548
You will die of suffocation

25:01.721 --> 25:04.887
in the icy cold of space.

25:28.038 --> 25:30.956
The Enterprise is heading
out of our galaxy,

25:31.124 --> 25:36.711
controlled by a mysterious alien
somewhere aboard the ship.

25:37.339 --> 25:39.960
Engineering has been taken over
by Klingons

25:40.133 --> 25:42.968
who have cut off
life-support systems.

25:43.428 --> 25:44.709
- Mr. Sulu.
- Captain.

25:44.888 --> 25:46.216
Get to Emergency Manual Control.

25:46.389 --> 25:49.593
Try to protect our life-support circuits
and auxiliary power.

25:49.768 --> 25:51.559
Aye, captain.

25:52.187 --> 25:53.729
- Scotty.
- Chekov was right, captain.

25:53.897 --> 25:55.640
Scotty, I'm glad they...

25:55.815 --> 25:59.813
We should have left those
fuzz-faced goons in the transporter.

26:00.403 --> 26:02.562
- That's right where they belong.
- Scotty?

26:02.739 --> 26:04.198
Non-existence.

26:04.365 --> 26:08.363
Now they can study the Enterprise,
add our technology to theirs,

26:08.536 --> 26:09.817
change the balance of power.

26:09.996 --> 26:12.997
- You've jeopardised the Federation.
- Scotty.

26:13.166 --> 26:16.700
- Listen, Scott.
- Keep your Vulcan hands off me.

26:17.587 --> 26:19.544
Just keep away.

26:19.714 --> 26:24.292
Your feelings might be hurt,
you green-blooded half-breed.

26:25.553 --> 26:29.681
May I say that I have not thoroughly
enjoyed serving with humans?

26:29.849 --> 26:34.012
I find their illogic and foolish emotions
a constant irritant.

26:34.186 --> 26:36.642
Then transfer out, freak.

26:41.694 --> 26:42.725
Gentlemen.

26:44.905 --> 26:47.692
Spock. Scotty. Spock.

26:47.866 --> 26:50.404
Spock!

26:50.577 --> 26:52.949
Stop it, you half-human.

26:59.086 --> 27:03.629
What are we saying?
What are we doing to each other?

27:04.508 --> 27:06.631
Fascinating.

27:06.802 --> 27:08.759
The result of stress?

27:08.929 --> 27:12.796
We've been under stress before.
It never set us at each other's throats.

27:12.974 --> 27:17.054
- Well, this is war.
- There isn't any war!

27:20.065 --> 27:21.309
Or is there?

27:21.483 --> 27:24.649
- Have we forgotten how to defend..?
- Scotty.

27:25.403 --> 27:27.728
What's happening to us?

27:27.906 --> 27:32.614
We've been trained to think
in other terms than war.

27:32.785 --> 27:36.700
We've been trained to fight its causes,
if necessary.

27:36.873 --> 27:39.992
Then why are we behaving
like a group of savages?

27:41.252 --> 27:42.960
Look at me.

27:43.838 --> 27:46.329
Look at me.

27:51.929 --> 27:55.428
Two forces aboard this ship,

27:55.599 --> 27:58.221
each of them equally armed.

27:59.645 --> 28:03.228
Has a war been staged for us?

28:04.149 --> 28:07.269
Complete with weapons,

28:07.444 --> 28:11.905
and ideology
and patriotic drum-beating?

28:12.074 --> 28:13.698
Even...

28:14.243 --> 28:15.653
Spock.

28:16.954 --> 28:20.821
Even race hatred?

28:22.167 --> 28:23.875
Recent events would seem
to be directed

28:24.044 --> 28:26.879
toward a magnification
of the basic hostilities

28:27.047 --> 28:29.502
between humans and Klingons.

28:29.674 --> 28:33.174
Apparently, it is by design
that we fight.

28:34.512 --> 28:38.177
- We seem to be pawns.
- But what's the game?

28:38.475 --> 28:41.725
And whose? And what are the rules?

28:41.895 --> 28:46.556
It is most urgent that we locate
the alien entity immediately

28:46.733 --> 28:50.682
and determine its motives
and a method for halting its activities.

28:50.862 --> 28:53.898
Without sensors?
All our power down?

28:54.323 --> 28:56.779
This thing could go anywhere.

28:56.951 --> 28:58.659
Yes.

29:03.416 --> 29:05.574
- Mr. Sulu, report.
- No good, captain.

29:06.252 --> 29:10.119
Circuits are in
but systems just aren't responding.

29:12.091 --> 29:14.083
We're getting something.

29:15.094 --> 29:16.802
Aye, captain.

29:16.971 --> 29:20.755
Power and life-support restored.

29:20.933 --> 29:23.091
- Remotes on standby.
- Good work.

29:23.268 --> 29:25.759
But, captain, I didn't do it.

29:25.938 --> 29:28.226
Everything just came on by itself.

29:33.612 --> 29:36.067
Their life-support systems
have resumed.

29:36.615 --> 29:39.450
- The sensors may be operating.
- Start scanning.

29:39.618 --> 29:40.993
Let's find that alien.

29:43.497 --> 29:46.948
- Holding steady.
- Cause them to be unsteady.

29:52.380 --> 29:54.752
They appear to be controlled
from another location.

29:56.676 --> 30:00.544
Also unable to affect ship's course
for return to our empire.

30:01.973 --> 30:04.429
One of Kirk's tricks.

30:05.602 --> 30:08.852
Could he bypass a circuit?

30:09.689 --> 30:14.683
What power supports our battle
yet starves our victory?

30:15.445 --> 30:17.271
Power.

30:18.656 --> 30:22.191
Interrupt it at their main
life-support couplings. Where?

30:22.368 --> 30:23.946
Number 6 Deck.

30:25.788 --> 30:27.413
Come.

30:44.473 --> 30:50.428
Alien detected in the Engineering
section, near reactor number 3.

30:51.355 --> 30:53.146
Let's go.

31:54.125 --> 31:56.580
You don't die yet.

31:59.797 --> 32:02.003
You're not human,

32:03.258 --> 32:05.465
but you're very beautiful.

32:06.470 --> 32:09.673
Very beautiful.

32:27.949 --> 32:29.823
Chekov.

32:33.622 --> 32:36.788
Jim. He's not responsible.

32:42.130 --> 32:44.039
What have I done?

32:55.017 --> 33:00.012
There's an alien entity aboard the ship,
it's forcing us to fight. We don't want to.

33:00.189 --> 33:02.063
We don't know what its motive is.

33:02.233 --> 33:05.103
We're trying to find out.
You must help us.

33:05.278 --> 33:08.314
Take me to Kang.
A temporary truce, that's all I ask.

33:13.911 --> 33:16.698
Spock, take her.

33:19.708 --> 33:21.831
Chekov.

33:22.252 --> 33:24.245
Chekov.

33:26.799 --> 33:31.507
Is this what's in store for us?
From here on in?

33:31.678 --> 33:35.427
Violence? Hatred?

33:52.866 --> 33:56.365
Brain waves show almost
paranoid mania. What happened?

33:56.536 --> 33:58.576
He lost control.

33:58.747 --> 34:00.573
So did I.

34:00.749 --> 34:04.532
We're becoming animal warriors.

34:04.711 --> 34:07.166
- Let's go, Spock.
- Orderly.

34:07.338 --> 34:09.045
Jim,

34:13.011 --> 34:15.132
Johnson's heart wound
is almost completely healed.

34:15.304 --> 34:16.715
The same with the other casualties.

34:16.889 --> 34:20.472
Sword wounds in the vital organs,
massive trauma, shock.

34:20.643 --> 34:22.766
They're all healing at a fantastic rate.

34:22.937 --> 34:25.641
It would appear
that the entity wants us alive.

34:25.815 --> 34:28.934
Why? So we can fight and fight

34:29.110 --> 34:32.858
and keep coming back for more
like some bloody coliseum?

34:33.030 --> 34:34.572
What's next? The roar of crowds?

34:34.739 --> 34:38.190
Perhaps human
and Klingon psychologies

34:38.369 --> 34:41.370
and combat capabilities
are being tested

34:41.538 --> 34:44.409
by an alien with designs
on both powers.

34:44.583 --> 34:46.291
Gentlemen, if we are pawns,

34:46.460 --> 34:48.831
you're looking at one
who is extremely sorry.

34:49.922 --> 34:51.464
I understand, doctor.

34:51.632 --> 34:54.917
I too felt a brief surge
of racial bigotry.

34:55.092 --> 34:56.885
Most distasteful.

34:57.763 --> 35:00.680
Let's find the alien.

35:00.849 --> 35:01.880
You come with us.

35:03.560 --> 35:06.514
Maybe we can prove to you
that it exists.

35:32.463 --> 35:33.957
What is it?

35:34.132 --> 35:35.330
Totally unfamiliar.

35:43.099 --> 35:45.138
What did you want?

35:46.102 --> 35:48.059
What are you doing here?

35:49.897 --> 35:52.020
Reporting for duty, sir.

35:53.526 --> 35:55.150
Duty?

35:55.319 --> 35:57.691
- Did McCoy release you from Sickbay?
- I released myself.

35:57.863 --> 35:58.894
Then get back to Sickbay.

35:59.073 --> 36:01.694
Not on your life, sir.
I'm fit and ready for action.

36:01.867 --> 36:04.440
The Klingons almost did me in once,
and I'm out to even the score.

36:04.620 --> 36:06.328
- I order you...
- I've got my orders.

36:06.497 --> 36:07.576
I'm obeying orders.

36:07.748 --> 36:08.779
Kill the Klingons.

36:08.957 --> 36:11.875
- It's them or us, isn't it?
- Johnson.

36:22.012 --> 36:23.839
Fascinating.

36:24.014 --> 36:26.339
During Lieutenant Johnson's
emotional outburst,

36:26.516 --> 36:29.683
his expression of hatred
and lust for vengeance,

36:29.853 --> 36:33.352
the alien's life-energy level
increased.

36:33.523 --> 36:35.765
When the lieutenant
became unconscious,

36:35.942 --> 36:38.267
the alien lost energy.

36:38.445 --> 36:41.695
It subsists on the emotions
of others?

36:42.490 --> 36:45.112
This one appears to be strengthened

36:45.285 --> 36:50.871
by mental radiations of hostility,
violent intentions.

36:51.874 --> 36:56.999
It exists on the hate of others.

36:57.171 --> 36:58.796
To put it simply.

36:58.965 --> 37:00.957
And it has acted as a catalyst,

37:01.133 --> 37:04.752
creating this situation,
in order to satisfy that need.

37:04.929 --> 37:07.420
It has brought together
opposing forces,

37:07.598 --> 37:09.887
provided crude instruments,

37:10.059 --> 37:14.139
in an effort to promote
the most violent mode of conflict.

37:14.313 --> 37:18.180
And kept numbers
and resources balanced,

37:18.359 --> 37:22.403
so that it can maintain
a constant state of violence.

37:22.571 --> 37:25.738
It's got to have a vulnerable area.

37:26.575 --> 37:28.069
We've got to get rid of it.

37:28.243 --> 37:32.027
Then all hostile attitudes on board
must be eliminated.

37:32.206 --> 37:34.412
The fighting must end. And soon.

37:34.583 --> 37:35.781
Or we're a doomed ship,

37:36.710 --> 37:40.755
travelling forever between galaxies,
filled with eternal bloodlust,

37:40.922 --> 37:43.295
eternal warfare.

37:44.051 --> 37:46.506
Kang has got to listen.

37:46.678 --> 37:48.884
We've got to pool our knowledge

37:49.055 --> 37:51.807
and get rid of this thing.

38:04.445 --> 38:06.070
Kang.

38:06.948 --> 38:08.691
Kang, this is Captain Kirk.

38:10.034 --> 38:11.149
Kang, do you read me?

38:11.953 --> 38:14.907
Commander, it's a trick.

38:20.962 --> 38:22.622
Kang.

38:26.217 --> 38:27.841
He won't answer.

38:28.010 --> 38:30.584
The alien is affecting
his mind, captain.

38:30.763 --> 38:35.804
Soon, it will become so powerful
that none of us will be able to resist it.

38:37.770 --> 38:38.801
Scotty, sir.

38:38.979 --> 38:40.806
The ships dilithium crystals
are deteriorating.

38:40.981 --> 38:42.475
We can't stop the process.

38:43.067 --> 38:44.312
Time factor?

38:44.485 --> 38:48.434
In 12 minutes,
we'll be totally without engine power.

38:49.865 --> 38:54.491
Well, do whatever you can. Kirk out.

39:09.342 --> 39:12.343
And so we drift in space,

39:12.512 --> 39:15.798
with only hatred
and bloodshed aboard.

39:17.976 --> 39:20.383
Now do you believe?

39:29.445 --> 39:34.154
Captain's log, stardate,
Armageddon.

39:34.492 --> 39:37.742
We must find a way
to defeat the alien force of hate

39:37.912 --> 39:42.075
that has taken over the Enterprise,
stop the war now,

39:42.250 --> 39:46.911
or spend eternity
in futile, bloody violence.

39:47.088 --> 39:50.291
There's no change, captain.
The dilithium crystals are discharging.

39:51.050 --> 39:52.425
There's nothing we can do about it.

39:53.135 --> 39:54.677
If I could talk to Kang,

39:54.845 --> 39:59.388
somehow cut through the Klingon
lines, make peace before it's too late.

39:59.558 --> 40:02.559
We have nine minutes, 53 seconds
to power zero.

40:02.728 --> 40:05.729
There is, of course,
a logical alternative.

40:05.898 --> 40:08.140
Kang's wife is after all our prisoner.

40:08.734 --> 40:11.439
- Perhaps a threat...
- Aye.

40:11.612 --> 40:14.731
Now that's something
the Klingons would understand.

40:28.253 --> 40:29.747
Kang.

40:30.630 --> 40:32.089
Kang, this is Captain Kirk.

40:32.257 --> 40:34.582
I know you can hear me
so don't cut me off.

40:35.343 --> 40:37.751
We have Mara, your wife.

40:38.596 --> 40:43.554
We talk truce now, or she dies.
Reply.

40:46.521 --> 40:49.094
She has five seconds to live.

40:49.482 --> 40:50.513
Reply.

40:58.282 --> 41:01.402
She is a victim of war, captain.

41:02.620 --> 41:05.111
She understands.

41:06.082 --> 41:08.288
He called my bluff.

41:09.251 --> 41:10.580
You're not going..?

41:10.753 --> 41:13.125
The Federation doesn't kill
or mistreat its prisoners.

41:13.297 --> 41:14.922
You've been listening to propaganda.

41:15.090 --> 41:18.257
- How much time?
- Eight minutes, 42 seconds.

41:21.055 --> 41:25.348
- So this was no trick.
- It's the alien that's done this.

41:25.517 --> 41:28.388
We're in its power.
Our people and yours.

41:28.562 --> 41:30.970
We only wanted to stop the fighting
to save us all.

41:31.148 --> 41:35.015
We have always fought. We must.

41:35.194 --> 41:40.318
We are hunters, captain,
tracking and taking what we need.

41:40.991 --> 41:44.157
There are poor planets
in the Klingon systems,

41:44.327 --> 41:47.412
we must push outward
if we are to survive.

41:48.498 --> 41:51.867
There's another way to survive.
Mutual trust and help.

41:59.426 --> 42:00.968
I will help you now.

42:02.929 --> 42:06.345
- How?
- I will take you to Kang.

42:06.516 --> 42:10.216
- I will add my voice to yours.
- I wouldn't trust her, captain.

42:12.605 --> 42:16.188
We can't get through
the Klingon defences in time.

42:16.359 --> 42:18.517
Unless...

42:19.695 --> 42:21.522
Spock.

42:22.198 --> 42:24.523
Intra-ship beaming

42:24.700 --> 42:26.527
from one section to another.
It's possible?

42:26.702 --> 42:29.276
It has rarely been done
because of the danger involved.

42:29.455 --> 42:31.661
Pinpoint accuracy is required.

42:31.832 --> 42:36.957
If the transportee should materialise
inside a solid object, a deck or a wall...

42:37.129 --> 42:41.293
Even if it could work,
she may be leading you into a trap.

42:42.134 --> 42:44.210
We're all in a trap.
This is the only way out.

42:44.386 --> 42:48.598
- We'll go with you.
- No, that'll start the final battle.

42:52.853 --> 42:53.884
I believe her.

42:58.442 --> 43:01.478
Prepare the transporter.
We'll wait for your signal.

43:02.821 --> 43:05.608
She can't guarantee
that Kang will stop to listen.

43:05.782 --> 43:07.276
Right, Mr. Spock?

43:07.451 --> 43:11.495
No one can guarantee
the actions of another.

43:20.338 --> 43:23.090
Your automatic setting
is laid in, captain.

43:23.258 --> 43:24.800
When transporter is energized,

43:24.968 --> 43:27.838
you will have eight seconds
to get to the pads.

43:28.012 --> 43:30.930
I hope your computations
are correct, Mr. Spock.

43:31.099 --> 43:34.966
You will know in 7.9 seconds,
captain.

43:52.912 --> 43:56.612
Mara. You're alive
and you bring us a prize.

43:56.790 --> 43:57.822
Kang, wait.

43:58.000 --> 44:01.665
He's come alone, unarmed.
He must talk to you.

44:01.837 --> 44:04.506
- Brave captain. What about?
- No!

44:05.090 --> 44:06.253
Listen to him.

44:06.425 --> 44:08.168
- We are all in danger.
- Mara.

44:09.219 --> 44:11.011
Before you start killing,
give me one minute.

44:12.222 --> 44:15.887
- Kang, don't.
- What have they done to you, Mara?

44:16.059 --> 44:19.345
Are you out of your mind?
What have they done to you?

44:23.483 --> 44:26.354
I see why the human beast
did not kill you.

44:26.903 --> 44:29.608
They didn't harm me. Listen to him.

44:46.756 --> 44:50.421
Stop. Stop, please!

44:55.014 --> 44:58.050
- With your death, we win.
- Nobody wins.

44:58.226 --> 45:02.093
Have any more of your men died?
We can't be killed.

45:02.271 --> 45:06.139
There's an alien aboard.
It wants us alive.

45:08.694 --> 45:14.448
No doubt you will reassemble
after I've hacked you to bits.

45:15.826 --> 45:17.202
You fool.

45:54.614 --> 45:55.645
Look.

45:57.951 --> 45:59.742
Look, Kang.

45:59.911 --> 46:02.828
For the rest of our lives,
a thousand lifetimes,

46:02.997 --> 46:05.868
senseless violence, fighting,

46:06.042 --> 46:10.870
while an alien
has total control over us.

46:25.686 --> 46:27.595
All right.

46:28.147 --> 46:30.104
All right.

46:30.274 --> 46:32.765
In the heart, the head,
I won't stay dead.

46:32.943 --> 46:35.102
Next time, I'll do the same to you.
I'll kill you.

46:35.279 --> 46:36.904
And it goes on,
the good old game of war.

46:37.072 --> 46:39.065
Pawn against pawn.

46:39.241 --> 46:41.649
Stopping the bad guys,

46:41.827 --> 46:47.746
while somewhere,
some thing sits back and laughs.

46:47.916 --> 46:49.826
And starts it all over again.

46:53.964 --> 46:56.502
- Let's jump him.
- Those who hate and fight

46:56.675 --> 47:00.375
must stop themselves, doctor,
otherwise, it is not stopped.

47:00.554 --> 47:03.757
Kang, I am your wife.

47:03.932 --> 47:06.304
I'm a Klingon.

47:06.476 --> 47:07.639
Would I lie for them?

47:08.645 --> 47:11.681
Listen to Kirk. He is telling the truth.

47:13.316 --> 47:15.356
Be a pawn, be a toy,

47:15.527 --> 47:17.899
be a good soldier
that never questions orders.

47:31.376 --> 47:34.293
Klingons kill for their own purposes.

47:34.462 --> 47:36.253
All fighting must end, captain,

47:36.422 --> 47:40.835
to weaken the alien
before our dilithium crystals are gone.

47:48.893 --> 47:50.885
- Lieutenant Uhura.
- Yes, captain?

47:51.062 --> 47:54.561
- Put me on ship-wide intercom.
- Aye, sir.

47:55.232 --> 47:57.189
Ready, captain.

47:59.153 --> 48:00.813
This is Captain Kirk.

48:00.988 --> 48:04.155
A truce is ordered.
The fighting is over.

48:04.325 --> 48:05.700
Lay down your weapons.

48:11.373 --> 48:13.698
This is Kang.

48:13.876 --> 48:16.367
Cease hostilities.

48:17.004 --> 48:18.249
Disarm.

48:27.973 --> 48:31.092
The cessation of violence
appears to have weakened it, captain.

48:31.268 --> 48:36.226
I suggest that good spirits
might make an effective weapon.

48:46.449 --> 48:47.528
Get off my ship.

48:48.743 --> 48:50.202
You're a dead duck,
you're powerless.

48:50.370 --> 48:54.070
We know about you
and we don't want to play.

48:55.375 --> 48:59.158
Maybe there are others
like you around,

48:59.337 --> 49:05.007
maybe you've caused a lot of suffering,
a lot of history, but that's all over.

49:05.176 --> 49:09.304
We'll be on guard now,
we'll be ready for you, so ship out.

49:09.472 --> 49:11.927
- Come on, haul it.
- Yeah, out already.

49:17.271 --> 49:20.971
Out! We need no urging
to hate humans.

49:22.109 --> 49:23.354
But for the present,

49:23.569 --> 49:26.356
only a fool
fights in a burning house. Out!
