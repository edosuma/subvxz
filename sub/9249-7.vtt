WEBVTT

00:04.113 --> 00:07.081
You know what looks good?
The French toast.

00:07.083 --> 00:08.750
I thought you were on a diet.
I am.

00:08.751 --> 00:11.686
But you're not.

00:11.688 --> 00:15.023
I am not gonna be
your surrogate eater again.

00:15.024 --> 00:16.825
You know, you're just selfish.

00:16.826 --> 00:19.261
You were born with a body
that can eat French toast.

00:19.262 --> 00:20.494
I wasn't.
What?!

00:20.496 --> 00:22.464
It's just weird
you watching me eat.

00:22.465 --> 00:24.399
Just leering,
barking out commands.

00:24.400 --> 00:25.600
"More syrup." "Slow down""

00:25.601 --> 00:27.968
"Don't ignore
the whipped cream""

00:27.970 --> 00:29.604
Come on, Carl.

00:29.605 --> 00:32.741
Nobody around here's
ordered anything I want.

00:32.741 --> 00:33.742
You two ready to order?

00:33.743 --> 00:34.643
Oh, where's Samuel?

00:34.644 --> 00:36.944
In the can
the last two hours.

00:36.946 --> 00:39.146
Want to hear the specials?

00:39.148 --> 00:40.148
That depends.

00:40.149 --> 00:41.616
Did Samuel eat a special?

00:41.617 --> 00:43.350
(chuckles)

00:43.352 --> 00:45.720
Two hours?
Should we go check on him?

00:45.721 --> 00:48.690
Yeah. All right, hold our booth.
Two black coffees.

00:48.691 --> 00:50.191
(quietly):
And he'll have the French toast,

00:50.192 --> 00:51.393
whipped cream on the side.

00:51.394 --> 00:53.594
He doesn't know to treat it.

00:57.132 --> 00:59.333
Sam, are you in here?

01:01.069 --> 01:02.904
Come on, man, I know it's you.

01:02.905 --> 01:04.504
I recognize your wide stance.

01:05.373 --> 01:07.341
Go away.

01:07.343 --> 01:09.944
Come on, Samuel. That toilet's
been busted for months.

01:09.945 --> 01:11.813
Yeah, he should know.
He was a material witness.

01:11.814 --> 01:13.381
I had nothing
to do with that.

01:13.382 --> 01:18.085
You can't convict a man
just 'cause he's got priors.

01:18.087 --> 01:20.888
I appreciate your concern,
but I would like to be alone.

01:20.889 --> 01:24.192
I've just received a very
disturbing letter from home.

01:24.193 --> 01:25.293
Aw, geez.
Did-did someone die?

01:25.294 --> 01:26.294
No.

01:26.295 --> 01:27.328
Anybody sick?

01:27.329 --> 01:28.296
No.

01:28.297 --> 01:31.032
Okay then.
We'll get out of your hair.

01:31.033 --> 01:33.968
"Dear Son...

01:33.969 --> 01:36.604
"Our village is once again in
the grips of a horrible drought.

01:36.605 --> 01:40.475
"Tribal warfare threatens
to break out at any minute.

01:40.476 --> 01:43.043
"So it is with deep
sadness I inform you

01:43.045 --> 01:44.445
"that this month

01:44.446 --> 01:48.515
we can only afford
to send you $164."

01:51.585 --> 01:53.554
Wait, your family
lives in Africa

01:53.555 --> 01:56.356
and they send <i> you</i> money?

01:56.358 --> 01:57.757
I know. I'm pathetic.

01:57.759 --> 01:59.727
Well, no, no,
now, you know...

01:59.728 --> 02:01.696
Well.

02:01.697 --> 02:03.964
Yeah, I'm trying to put
a positive spin on this,

02:03.965 --> 02:05.733
but I keep picturing
a guy covered in flies

02:05.734 --> 02:07.300
writing you a check.

02:07.302 --> 02:11.738
Out of 14 children, I was
the one they sent to America.

02:11.740 --> 02:12.773
Look at me.

02:12.774 --> 02:14.408
I'm a complete failure.

02:14.409 --> 02:18.012
They put all of their ostrich
eggs in the wrong basket.

02:18.013 --> 02:21.247
No. Now-now,
you know...

02:21.249 --> 02:24.417
Well.

02:24.419 --> 02:26.120
My family can't afford
to support me anymore,

02:26.121 --> 02:27.520
and I can't afford to live here.

02:27.522 --> 02:30.256
They're telling me
I should come back home.

02:32.192 --> 02:33.693
Sorry, pal.

02:33.695 --> 02:35.929
What am I going to do?
Oh. Okay.

02:35.930 --> 02:37.864
All right. Okay.

02:37.866 --> 02:39.299
I might as well
get up in this, too.

02:39.300 --> 02:41.367
(sunglasses clatter)
Oh.

02:45.239 --> 02:48.207
Can you give us a minute?
We're just finishing up in here.

03:18.706 --> 03:20.106
VICTORIA:
<i>Hey, Mol.</i>

03:20.108 --> 03:21.875
Taste this.

03:21.877 --> 03:24.211
Mom and I are perfecting
our smoothie recipe.

03:24.212 --> 03:26.580
It's got flax seed,
protein powder, kale,

03:26.581 --> 03:30.116
and three different kinds
of rum.

03:33.053 --> 03:35.022
Whew!
That's got quite a kick.

03:35.023 --> 03:38.358
Well, at least
I can't taste the kale.

03:39.226 --> 03:40.528
Hey.

03:40.529 --> 03:41.795
Hey. How was your day?

03:41.796 --> 03:43.196
Not good.
Got some bad news.

03:43.198 --> 03:46.466
Looks like Samuel's gonna have
to move back to Africa.

03:46.468 --> 03:47.835
Wait, he's leaving?

03:47.836 --> 03:49.770
Yeah, he just doesn't have
the money to stay...

03:49.771 --> 03:51.571
Oh, smoothies!

03:52.873 --> 03:54.941
Oh, no.
That's terrible.

03:54.943 --> 03:56.509
Wait a minute, how bad is it?

03:56.511 --> 03:59.912
Not bad, man... more rum,
less kale, you got a winner.

03:59.914 --> 04:02.648
No, I mean Samuel.

04:02.650 --> 04:04.317
Oh, I don't know. I didn't ask.

04:04.319 --> 04:05.752
Well, when is he leaving?

04:05.753 --> 04:06.953
No clue.

04:06.955 --> 04:08.521
Well, what's he gonna do
when he gets back home?

04:08.523 --> 04:10.489
I don't know.
Probably African stuff.

04:12.593 --> 04:14.628
So Samuel is going through
something like this,

04:14.629 --> 04:16.396
and you didn't find out
any details?

04:16.397 --> 04:18.464
No, I did not... it's called
respecting a friend's privacy.

04:18.466 --> 04:19.733
When a guy's going
through something,

04:19.733 --> 04:21.767
you don't poke your nose in,
you avert your gaze

04:21.769 --> 04:23.903
and let him go down the drain
with dignity.

04:26.006 --> 04:29.042
He's your friend.
He's not a dead goldfish.

04:29.043 --> 04:31.178
You don't get it.
The last thing a guy wants

04:31.179 --> 04:33.213
is for his friends
to see him vulnerable.

04:33.214 --> 04:35.982
It's like when we shower
at the gym... eyes forward.

04:35.983 --> 04:40.320
The naked, wet man next to you
is invisible.

04:40.321 --> 04:42.221
That's ridiculous.

04:42.223 --> 04:44.324
Well, you say that
because shower time for you gals

04:44.325 --> 04:46.426
is an excuse to get
in each others' business.

04:46.427 --> 04:49.728
Giggling, tickling,
lathering each other up.

04:50.897 --> 04:53.900
You forgot the mud wrestling
before we get <i> in</i> the shower.

04:53.901 --> 04:56.902
Mom, don't... he's gonna
think you're serious.

04:56.904 --> 05:01.073
Mike, friends help friends
whether they ask for it or not.

05:01.075 --> 05:03.876
We're not gonna just do nothing
and then let Samuel leave.

05:03.878 --> 05:05.178
Molly,

05:05.179 --> 05:09.114
sometimes nothing
is the kindest thing you <i> can</i> do.

05:09.116 --> 05:10.450
Mike,

05:10.451 --> 05:12.951
that's a load of crap.

05:14.420 --> 05:16.022
You just don't want
to do anything

05:16.023 --> 05:18.056
that has real emotions involved.

05:18.058 --> 05:19.392
Exactly. You get it.

05:19.393 --> 05:21.026
We're saying the same thing.

05:27.133 --> 05:29.369
That was a very nice dinner. Aw.

05:29.370 --> 05:31.069
Thank you for
inviting me over.

05:31.071 --> 05:33.039
Oh, no, that was
Molly's idea.

05:33.040 --> 05:36.142
I'm a friend. I didn't want
to go anywhere near you.

05:36.143 --> 05:40.045
No, the reason we had you over,
'cause we're concerned and...

05:40.047 --> 05:41.480
we care
about you.

05:41.482 --> 05:42.515
Right, Mike?
Yeah, yeah.

05:42.516 --> 05:43.649
What?

05:43.650 --> 05:44.984
I said yes.

05:44.985 --> 05:46.319
Then it might be nice

05:46.320 --> 05:49.187
for your friend to
hear that... from you.

05:49.189 --> 05:51.356
Okay. I care. He knows that.
(chuckles)

05:51.358 --> 05:54.426
Doesn't mean
I don't like to hear it.

05:55.962 --> 05:58.731
Listen, Samuel, I know
that things haven't gone

05:58.732 --> 06:01.934
quite the way you wanted to
since you moved to America.

06:01.935 --> 06:03.736
You mean the fact
that my health plan

06:03.737 --> 06:06.005
is the first aid kit from Abe's?

06:06.006 --> 06:10.208
And that my best hope for
retirement is to die at 45?

06:10.210 --> 06:12.544
Well, at least you still
have your sense of humor.

06:12.546 --> 06:15.013
Did I say something
that was funny?

06:15.015 --> 06:17.917
No, no, no. Uh, the...

06:17.918 --> 06:20.786
my point is that maybe
we should not be talking

06:20.787 --> 06:22.755
about why you should
leave the country

06:22.756 --> 06:24.990
but maybe why you
should be staying.

06:24.991 --> 06:26.959
You know, that's
actually not bad.

06:26.960 --> 06:28.494
Well, thank you.

06:28.495 --> 06:30.429
I mean, it's really about
creating an open dialogue

06:30.430 --> 06:32.264
- so he feels heard...
- Molly...

06:32.265 --> 06:33.766
Just a sec, Samuel.

06:33.767 --> 06:36.035
And how you can give
him something positive

06:36.036 --> 06:37.603
to take away and
keep with him

06:37.604 --> 06:40.471
even when you're no longer there
to kind of encourage him.

06:40.473 --> 06:42.641
You know what, I was
just afraid to see my friend

06:42.642 --> 06:44.242
crying in front of me.

06:44.244 --> 06:47.679
Sometimes when you open yourself
up to other people's pain,

06:47.680 --> 06:50.048
you're the one that
ends up getting healed.

06:50.049 --> 06:53.784
You're amazing. Aw. (chuckles)

06:53.786 --> 06:55.554
So we really haven't solved

06:55.555 --> 06:57.356
how I'm going
to stay in this country.

06:57.357 --> 06:59.691
You know what
we're gonna do?

06:59.692 --> 07:01.360
We're gonna have cake.

07:01.361 --> 07:02.661
Huh? Do you want cake?

07:02.662 --> 07:05.730
Want cake? Cake? Cake it is!
Sounds like a plan to me.

07:09.968 --> 07:13.604
Okay, remember, we're just here
to offer Samuel moral support.

07:13.606 --> 07:15.840
So be nice
and treat him normally.

07:15.842 --> 07:18.275
Which is it? Are we being nice
or treating him normally?

07:18.277 --> 07:19.411
I'm just saying, sometimes

07:19.412 --> 07:21.046
when you open yourself up
to someone's pain,

07:21.047 --> 07:23.014
you might be the one
who's rewarded.

07:23.015 --> 07:24.449
Hmm.
I know I was last night.

07:24.450 --> 07:26.984
Molly and I couldn't keep
our hands off each other.

07:26.986 --> 07:28.320
(chuckles)

07:28.321 --> 07:29.387
Uh, uh, hold on.

07:29.388 --> 07:32.657
Uh, I think I almost have enough
for the buy-in.

07:32.658 --> 07:35.492
Just put that crap down.
We got your buy-in.

07:35.494 --> 07:36.528
But I can't take your money.

07:36.529 --> 07:38.028
He has his pride.

07:38.030 --> 07:39.797
Can I have my five dollars back?

07:39.799 --> 07:42.599
You shut up. You sit down.

07:42.601 --> 07:45.603
That is very
kind of you.

07:45.604 --> 07:46.971
Ah...

07:46.972 --> 07:49.640
It's good to be
with friends.

07:49.642 --> 07:51.876
I'm gonna miss this.

07:51.877 --> 07:54.778
(quavering): It could actually
be our last poker game.

07:54.780 --> 07:55.947
No.

07:55.948 --> 07:57.048
Oh, you mean together.

07:57.049 --> 07:58.683
Yeah, probably.

07:58.684 --> 07:59.617
So...

07:59.618 --> 08:01.818
five-card stud,
quarter ante.

08:01.820 --> 08:03.788
Yeah, well-well,
look at the up-side, man.

08:03.789 --> 08:06.124
I mean, you may be a penniless
foreigner with no prospects,

08:06.125 --> 08:08.660
but you know what you do have?

08:08.661 --> 08:10.861
You got a great head of hair.

08:11.729 --> 08:13.998
I'll sell it to you.

08:13.999 --> 08:15.400
I feel bad

08:15.401 --> 08:17.268
for you, kid.
It's tough being an immigrant.

08:17.269 --> 08:19.337
Not like when us Italians
first came here.

08:19.338 --> 08:21.806
In those days, if you worked
hard and paid your dues,

08:21.807 --> 08:24.574
my family would leave you alone.

08:25.877 --> 08:28.880
I'm just saying,
it's much harder now.

08:28.881 --> 08:30.882
There's got to be a way
for you to make more money.

08:30.883 --> 08:32.717
Have you thought
about asking Abe for a raise?

08:32.717 --> 08:35.019
The man is too cheap.
He wouldn't even buy me

08:35.020 --> 08:36.953
a new name tag
when I started working there.

08:36.955 --> 08:38.455
Well, your name tag says
"Samuel."

08:38.457 --> 08:40.258
Do I look like a Samuel to you?

08:40.259 --> 08:42.726
My real name is Babatunde.

08:43.828 --> 08:46.931
Well, Bobby, here's my advice.

08:46.932 --> 08:50.367
Tell him to give you a raise
'cause the place down the street

08:50.368 --> 08:52.702
is offering you
a managerial position.

08:52.704 --> 08:53.937
But that is a lie.
No!

08:53.939 --> 08:55.473
It's a bluff. Like in cards.

08:55.474 --> 08:58.209
Sometimes a good bluff
is better than a good hand.

08:58.210 --> 09:00.710
I raise ten.

09:00.712 --> 09:02.479
Fold. I'm out. Too rich for me.

09:02.480 --> 09:03.479
Hey...

09:03.481 --> 09:04.782
It's not what you have.

09:04.783 --> 09:06.883
It's what they think you have.

09:08.185 --> 09:10.754
Wait...

09:10.755 --> 09:12.922
I'm all in.

09:12.924 --> 09:16.393
But not in this case, though.
I got a full house.

09:16.394 --> 09:20.096
Man, you cannot catch a break.

09:26.036 --> 09:27.771
Samuel's been
back there a while.

09:27.772 --> 09:30.808
I'm starting to think
we sent him down a bad path.

09:30.809 --> 09:32.309
Look, either he comes out
with a raise,

09:32.310 --> 09:33.577
or he comes out with nothing,

09:33.578 --> 09:35.946
which is exactly
what he has now.

09:35.947 --> 09:38.514
Plus, a fantastic head of hair.

09:38.516 --> 09:39.850
God, I'm so nervous,

09:39.851 --> 09:41.751
I can't even watch you eat.
(laughs)

09:41.753 --> 09:43.653
Hey, what happened?

09:43.654 --> 09:45.589
What did he say?

09:45.590 --> 09:47.824
Uh, he said
he couldn't give me a raise

09:47.825 --> 09:50.059
because
business hasn't been great.

09:50.061 --> 09:52.094
He showed me all
of the books,

09:52.096 --> 09:54.097
the operating costs,
the debt-to-profit ledger.

09:54.098 --> 09:57.067
Oh, why would he have all that
paperwork just sitting around?

09:57.068 --> 09:59.035
It turns out,
he's trying to sell the place.

09:59.036 --> 10:01.071
But if someone would take on
all of the debt,

10:01.072 --> 10:03.340
he'd let them have it
at a great discount.

10:03.341 --> 10:06.308
Good luck to the idiot
who takes that deal.

10:06.310 --> 10:08.511
Thank you.

10:08.512 --> 10:10.846
I'll need it.

10:10.848 --> 10:13.148
Welcome to Babatunde's!

10:27.468 --> 10:30.171
So, Abe laid the place
off on him for a dollar,

10:30.172 --> 10:32.306
and now he's on the hook
for a two-year lease

10:32.307 --> 10:34.075
and a stack of
past-due bills.

10:34.076 --> 10:36.776
There's no way
that's legally binding.

10:36.778 --> 10:39.146
It is... a contract
was witnessed and signed.

10:39.147 --> 10:41.482
Turns out the dishwasher
isn't just a pot dealer.

10:41.483 --> 10:43.584
He's also a notary.

10:43.585 --> 10:47.353
Well, what do we do now?

10:47.355 --> 10:49.622
Nothing. Don't you see?
He was doing

10:49.624 --> 10:51.825
just fine before
we stepped in.

10:51.826 --> 10:54.494
He was on the next plane
back to Africa.

10:54.496 --> 10:55.996
Well, better on
the way to Africa

10:55.997 --> 10:57.498
than on the way
to bankruptcy.

10:57.499 --> 10:59.767
Well, actually,
bankruptcy is not as big a deal

10:59.768 --> 11:01.235
as everybody makes of it.

11:01.236 --> 11:03.002
I mean, I've bounced back.
Twice.

11:03.004 --> 11:05.772
What?
What?

11:05.774 --> 11:07.207
Now, what did you just...?

11:07.208 --> 11:08.942
What did...
what did you just...?

11:08.943 --> 11:10.110
I'm... I'm just...

11:10.111 --> 11:13.012
can we just focus
on Samuel, please?

11:13.014 --> 11:15.182
Oh, Moll, he's in
way over his head.

11:15.183 --> 11:16.416
Look, instead of talking

11:16.417 --> 11:18.118
about what's wrong with
Samuel, we should...

11:18.119 --> 11:21.053
we should focus on
what's right with us.

11:24.458 --> 11:26.425
What are you doing?

11:26.427 --> 11:28.261
Nothing... I'm just
opening a-a dialogue

11:28.262 --> 11:30.297
like we did the other night.

11:30.298 --> 11:31.798
Samuel would want this.

11:31.799 --> 11:33.800
Nice try.

11:33.801 --> 11:35.836
Oh, where you going?

11:35.837 --> 11:38.305
I'm going to the diner to see
if our friend needs any help.

11:38.306 --> 11:39.706
'Cause unlike you,
when I'm in the shower

11:39.707 --> 11:40.874
next to a naked man, I look.

11:40.875 --> 11:42.074
All right.

11:50.817 --> 11:51.751
Hello!

11:51.752 --> 11:53.852
It's open.
Oh.

11:53.854 --> 11:56.655
Congratulations,
restaurant owner.

11:59.259 --> 12:01.427
Wait...

12:05.231 --> 12:07.667
Well, you-you get it. Yay!

12:07.668 --> 12:11.971
So, how's it going?

12:11.972 --> 12:13.739
Ah, what can I say?

12:13.741 --> 12:15.842
Yesterday,
I was asking for a raise.

12:15.843 --> 12:19.545
Today, I'm giving myself a pay cut.
Oh. Well,

12:19.547 --> 12:21.714
maybe instead of that,
you should fire the dishwasher.

12:21.715 --> 12:23.849
I hear he sells drugs.

12:24.684 --> 12:26.085
Hey, thank you for coming.

12:26.086 --> 12:28.221
I'd give you a hug,
but there's no reason

12:28.222 --> 12:30.657
for both of us
to be covered in black mold.

12:30.658 --> 12:32.358
Oh!

12:32.359 --> 12:33.959
Oh... black mold.

12:33.961 --> 12:36.095
Well, I don't know if
it's black mold. Yeah...

12:36.096 --> 12:37.463
But it's mold.
Yeah.

12:37.464 --> 12:40.232
And it's black, so...

12:40.234 --> 12:42.268
Well... well,
like they always say,

12:42.269 --> 12:46.939
if it quacks like a duck,
you should put on a face mask.

12:46.940 --> 12:49.275
Well, preventing a terminal
lung disease is not high

12:49.276 --> 12:51.544
on my list
of priorities right now.

12:51.545 --> 12:53.946
It's actually number 257,

12:53.947 --> 12:56.915
uh, right after
"Get a juke box."

12:59.485 --> 13:01.287
Listen, Samuel, I...

13:01.288 --> 13:03.856
I just want you to know,
you're not in this alone.

13:03.857 --> 13:06.025
And all your friends
are here to support you

13:06.026 --> 13:07.425
every step of the way.

13:07.427 --> 13:09.762
The same friends that gave me
money to play poker,

13:09.763 --> 13:12.564
and then, they cruelly
took it away from me?

13:12.566 --> 13:17.269
Okay, maybe not those friends,
but this one, you know?

13:17.270 --> 13:20.172
You know what?
I say we attack...

13:20.173 --> 13:22.408
here we go...
that to-do list.

13:22.409 --> 13:24.410
Come on, give me
the first one on the list.

13:24.411 --> 13:25.743
Uh...

13:25.745 --> 13:27.479
"Find a friend

13:27.480 --> 13:32.117
to co-sign a $20,000
business improvement loan."

13:32.118 --> 13:33.953
Ooh!

13:33.954 --> 13:35.454
"Number two... clean floors."

13:35.455 --> 13:38.022
Let's get on that.

13:45.964 --> 13:48.433
Sweetie,
this is a bad idea.

13:48.435 --> 13:50.269
I know, but he
wanted to present us

13:50.270 --> 13:52.104
with his business
plan for the loan.

13:52.105 --> 13:54.772
Yeah, but we can't afford that.
If he defaults, it's on us.

13:54.774 --> 13:56.108
What was I supposed
to tell him?

13:56.109 --> 13:58.410
"No." "No way."
"No chance." "Hell, no."

13:58.411 --> 14:00.946
Anything from the "no" family.
Okay.

14:00.947 --> 14:02.247
You know that's not my role.

14:02.248 --> 14:03.881
You're the hard-ass,
I'm the nice one.

14:03.883 --> 14:05.484
You really think
you're the nice one?

14:05.485 --> 14:07.785
Shut up, Vince.

14:10.956 --> 14:13.025
Hey...
You.

14:13.026 --> 14:14.826
(both laugh anxiously)

14:14.827 --> 14:16.128
Please, sit.

14:16.129 --> 14:17.429
Oh. No.

14:17.430 --> 14:19.630
Oh, you...

14:20.532 --> 14:22.501
Thank you for your interest
in investing

14:22.502 --> 14:23.702
in Babatunde's Hot Beef.
MOLLY: Oh.

14:23.703 --> 14:25.403
No.
Not yet.

14:25.404 --> 14:27.139
It-It's all right.

14:27.140 --> 14:28.607
He should be skeptical.

14:28.608 --> 14:30.642
Look at the money
this restaurant has lost

14:30.643 --> 14:31.909
in the last year alone.

14:31.911 --> 14:34.246
I have worked at that diner
for over eight years.

14:34.247 --> 14:36.781
I know what is wrong,
and I know how to fix it.

14:36.782 --> 14:38.016
I saw where there was waste.

14:38.017 --> 14:39.451
I saw where
there was mismanagement.

14:39.452 --> 14:42.152
And last night, I saw where
the rats were coming in from.

14:42.154 --> 14:43.787
Rats?
Uh, yes.

14:43.789 --> 14:47.024
Apparently, the black mold
was keeping them at bay. Look...

14:48.760 --> 14:51.262
I believe the menu needs
to be simplified,

14:51.263 --> 14:53.798
the quality of food needs
to be higher,

14:53.799 --> 14:57.302
and in turn,
the people will pay more.

14:57.303 --> 15:00.337
I will be diligent,
I will work hard,

15:00.339 --> 15:05.242
and I will devote my life
to making this diner a success.

15:07.445 --> 15:09.646
Really good stuff.

15:12.517 --> 15:13.584
Yes. Yeah.

15:13.585 --> 15:15.587
Can we, uh...
can-can we have a second?

15:15.588 --> 15:16.954
Oh, take all the time
you need.

15:16.956 --> 15:19.157
I know
this is a big decision.

15:19.158 --> 15:20.925
Biggest of my life.

15:20.926 --> 15:23.994
(laughs)

15:23.996 --> 15:26.164
Now you can tell him no.
I can't tell him

15:26.165 --> 15:27.964
after he poured his
heart out... you say it.

15:27.966 --> 15:30.634
If I could've said it,
I would've said it at the diner.

15:30.636 --> 15:32.870
All right, we'll say "no"
together, on three.

15:32.871 --> 15:34.639
Fine.

15:34.640 --> 15:37.975
Okay. One, two, three.

15:37.976 --> 15:41.645
No!
Oh, Mike. Well...

15:42.914 --> 15:44.015
If that's his decision.

15:44.016 --> 15:46.017
Aw...

15:46.018 --> 15:48.519
Look, uh, I believe
in you, Samuel,

15:48.520 --> 15:50.554
and if anybody can
do this, you can.

15:50.555 --> 15:52.390
But you're also a good friend,

15:52.391 --> 15:54.491
and I'd hate for money
to jeopardize that.

15:54.493 --> 15:56.660
Of course. I should never
have put you

15:56.661 --> 15:58.129
in this awkward position.

15:58.130 --> 16:01.030
Hang on. I'm in.

16:01.932 --> 16:02.833
What?

16:02.834 --> 16:04.502
I'll co-sign the loan.

16:04.503 --> 16:06.370
But what about our friendship?

16:06.371 --> 16:08.339
What friendship?

16:08.340 --> 16:09.907
This is an investment.

16:09.908 --> 16:11.642
I'm always looking for
a distressed business

16:11.643 --> 16:15.813
to revamp, sell off
or burn down.

16:15.814 --> 16:18.015
Oh, Vince, thank you!

16:18.016 --> 16:20.351
Just know, I won't work 24-7.

16:20.352 --> 16:21.784
I will work 25-8.

16:21.786 --> 16:24.721
I know, 'cause I'll
be on your ass 26-9.

16:26.490 --> 16:27.825
You think we should warn him

16:27.826 --> 16:29.293
about getting into
business together?

16:29.294 --> 16:31.127
Which "him"?

16:46.919 --> 16:48.254
Come in. Come in.

16:48.255 --> 16:50.156
Thank you for making
Abe's... Whoa!

16:50.157 --> 16:53.091
...your first choice
in hot beef.

16:53.093 --> 16:55.561
Oh. What happened to
calling it Babatunde's?

16:55.562 --> 16:56.863
Ah, Vince made a good point.

16:56.864 --> 16:58.898
Uh, right now, we can't afford
to change the sign.

16:58.899 --> 17:00.265
Or my name tag.

17:01.267 --> 17:03.402
Well, I love what
you've done to the place.

17:03.403 --> 17:05.570
So far, we've just spruced it up
a little.

17:05.571 --> 17:09.474
Uh, if you'll notice, your feet
no longer stick to the floor.

17:09.476 --> 17:12.845
That's nice.
I like that.

17:12.846 --> 17:14.714
Hey, man, I always knew
you could do it.

17:14.714 --> 17:16.147
Yeah, not enough
to give me a loan.

17:16.148 --> 17:18.483
No. Now, now, you know...

17:18.484 --> 17:20.453
Well...

17:20.454 --> 17:22.054
You know, just for the record,

17:22.055 --> 17:24.089
we were very close
to saying yes.

17:24.090 --> 17:26.692
And I was equally close to
naming a sandwich after you.

17:26.693 --> 17:27.660
(laughs)

17:27.661 --> 17:29.795
How was that not part
of the pitch?

17:29.796 --> 17:33.032
We're doing a tasting menu.

17:33.033 --> 17:36.135
So far, all I taste is salt.

17:36.136 --> 17:39.171
Look at this. I got my own booth
where I can hold court.

17:39.172 --> 17:42.007
This is kind of me and Mike's booth.
Not anymore.

17:42.008 --> 17:43.275
I'm an angel investor.

17:43.276 --> 17:45.377
And you two are gonna have
to start paying now.

17:45.378 --> 17:47.079
Does he have
that kind of power?

17:47.080 --> 17:49.515
Mike, you are a good friend,
and I would hate

17:49.516 --> 17:51.849
for you not paying me money
to jeopardize that. Eh.
