you can tell from the photos

23:12.770 --> 23:16.291
on the wall that the people
who normally perform here,

23:16.395 --> 23:19.363
they have actual material,
you could--

23:19.467 --> 23:21.883
they're doing it in the picture,
there's a picture

23:21.986 --> 23:24.230
of a lady going like, "Gah!"

23:24.333 --> 23:28.027
She's in the middle, she's just
finishing explaining like, like,

23:28.130 --> 23:30.478
what Jack Nicholson would be
like in a drive through.

23:30.581 --> 23:32.100
[laughing]

23:32.203 --> 23:34.930
That's a bummer like, you-you
you've decided to do this tour

23:35.034 --> 23:36.449
and you come out and stand there
with a microphone,

23:36.553 --> 23:40.108
you feel this onus to live up
to Bobby Lee and, um,

23:40.211 --> 23:43.870

with the Hawaiian shirt.

Yeah, I want people to relax
and have a good time,

23:53.639 --> 23:56.780
I wanna be the reason they,
uh, the-they were entertained.

23:56.883 --> 23:59.058
I think that's what drew me
out here is--it was like,

23:59.161 --> 24:01.716
I want something, I wanna feel
like I, like, I, you know,

24:01.819 --> 24:05.582

for a living, and it is--

24:05.685 --> 24:07.135
-Th--they deserve--
-Love you!

24:07.238 --> 24:10.103
They deserve better--
stop saying you love me!

my respect, I hate myself.

24:32.712 --> 24:34.162
-How?
-Because they kept ge--

"You're off the hook,

of almost Harmontown.

I definitely, like, like,
all I want on my deathbed

a contact.

find as we go is that

the people that come

is making itself really clear.

about just dumb, stupid stuff,

Hello, America, I'm Ben Stiller.

30:50.331 --> 30:52.298
I've directed an incredible
new action series

30:52.402 --> 30:54.300
called Heat Vision and Jack.

30:54.404 --> 30:56.475

of a super intelligent,

30:56.578 --> 31:00.237
renegade astronaut
and his talking motorcycle.

31:05.760 --> 31:08.867

one of your favorite

The pilot was legendary
for a long time, I mean, like,

31:27.506 --> 31:29.197
that was a tape
that you would try to hunt down

31:29.301 --> 31:31.096
to see the pilot
for Heat Vision and Jack.

31:31.199 --> 31:34.271
Yeah, it's got a cult following,
which, I guess is, you know,

31:34.375 --> 31:36.653

consolation prize.

we think would be a cool show.

32:00.953 --> 32:03.542

it got really dark

32:03.645 --> 32:06.545

Hollywood really, uh,

32:06.648 --> 32:07.926
rejected us.

32:09.755 --> 32:13.724

that our mantra would always be

32:13.828 --> 32:16.451
make the shows you would
wanna see and I think that

32:16.555 --> 32:19.420

01:15:20.481 --> 01:15:22.310
the thing that really
causes the fight is--

01:15:22.414 --> 01:15:24.520
is the tour manager
comes up to me

01:15:24.623 --> 01:15:28.144

want to be on?"

telling it to Erin,

01:15:32.079 --> 01:15:34.460

in the bathroom.

from there and Dan, uh,

01:16:00.279 --> 01:16:02.903

when we were growing up,

he would not be
around sometimes

01:16:39.456 --> 01:16:42.045

house praying with them

01:16:42.149 --> 01:16:43.840
