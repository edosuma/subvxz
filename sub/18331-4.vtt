01:06.441 --> 01:08.485
I'm hand making your costume.

Why, you ask,
would I go to all the trouble

01:11.029 --> 01:12.822
when all the other moms go to the store

01:12.906 --> 01:15.784
and buy something cheap, generic
and possibly flammable?

01:18.286 --> 01:21.498
It's not because those mothers
love their children any less,

01:21.581 --> 01:23.917

20:03.660 --> 20:06.205
is that I raised breast cancer awareness.

about us not being here.

any monster friends at the park?
