WEBVTT

00:05.233 --> 00:07.200
- HEY.
KIDS ARE ASLEEP ALREADY?

00:07.200 --> 00:08.900
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
GONNA READ THEM A STORY.

00:08.900 --> 00:14.400
- I DID, BUT I PUT ON
MY BORING VOICE, YOU KNOW?

00:14.400 --> 00:19.900
"I HUFFED AND PUFFED
AND BLEW THE HOUSE DOWN."

00:19.900 --> 00:22.333
- EH, WHAT A DIFFERENCE.

00:26.567 --> 00:27.400
HERE.

00:27.400 --> 00:28.733
- WHAT?
WHAT IS IT?

00:28.733 --> 00:31.133
- IT'S BRACIOLE,
YOU KNOW, STUFFED BEEF.

00:31.133 --> 00:33.000
- REALLY, BRACIOLE?
WHO MADE IT?

00:33.000 --> 00:34.600
- I DID.

00:37.533 --> 00:40.700
JUST TRY IT.

00:40.700 --> 00:42.033
- YOU'RE NOT HAVING ANY?

00:42.033 --> 00:44.833
- NO, I HAD SOME,
YOU KNOW, WITH THE KIDS.

00:44.833 --> 00:45.867
I HAD SOME
WITH THE KIDS.

00:45.867 --> 00:47.167
- OH.

00:47.167 --> 00:50.367
HOW YOU FEELIN'?

00:50.367 --> 00:51.967
- IT'S NOT POISON, RAY.

00:51.967 --> 00:54.767
IF I WANTED TO KILL YOU,
I WOULDN'T DO IT THAT WAY.

00:56.667 --> 01:00.100
- ALL RIGHT.
THAT GOES IN THE FILE.

01:07.533 --> 01:10.167
HEY!

01:10.167 --> 01:11.167

THE SECOND TIME,

01:15.367 --> 01:19.933
NOW THAT MY TONGUE'S

01:19.933 --> 01:21.200
MMM.

01:21.200 --> 01:22.533
- YEAH?
YOU REALLY LIKE IT?

01:22.533 --> 01:23.733

01:23.733 --> 01:24.800
LET ME AT IT.

01:24.800 --> 01:27.567
- OH!
I'M SO HAPPY!

01:27.567 --> 01:29.967
YEAH, THAT'S--OH, LOOK,
YOU'RE SITTING DOWN.

01:29.967 --> 01:32.500
OH!

01:32.500 --> 01:34.800
I DID IT, HUH?
I REALLY DID IT.

01:34.800 --> 01:36.233
- MOMMY!

01:36.233 --> 01:37.567

I'LL BE UP IN JUST A SECOND!

01:37.567 --> 01:39.300
OKAY, I'M GONNA GET ALLY

01:39.300 --> 01:40.867
YOU KNOW, THERE'S A LOT MORE
ON THE STOVE HERE.

01:40.867 --> 01:42.367

01:42.367 --> 01:45.333

01:51.800 --> 01:53.200
MMM.

02:05.067 --> 02:08.100

02:08.100 --> 02:09.367
I'M IN THE CONSERVATORY,

02:09.367 --> 02:11.967
AND I'D LIKE
TO CALL ON MRS. PEACOCK

02:11.967 --> 02:14.567
WITH THE LEAD PIPE.

02:16.433 --> 02:19.233
- I WAS JUST ONE AWAY
FROM THE LIBRARY, FRANK.

02:19.233 --> 02:21.900
YOU'RE JUST PICKING ON ME.

02:21.900 --> 02:24.133
- TOUGH CRAP, PEACOCK.

02:26.500 --> 02:30.633
GET YOUR TAIL FEATHERS
IN THE CONSERVATORY.

02:30.633 --> 02:31.633
- HEY.

02:31.633 --> 02:32.833
- OH, HI, DEAR.

02:32.833 --> 02:34.333
WE'RE PLAYING CLUE.

02:34.333 --> 02:36.200
IT'S KEEPING
ROBERT'S MIND SHARP

02:36.200 --> 02:39.067
FOR WHEN
HE'S A POLICEMAN AGAIN.

02:43.633 --> 02:45.367
- YEAH, YOU KNOW, RAY,
THERE'S BEEN A WAVE

02:45.367 --> 02:49.033
OF CANDLESTICK MURDERS
IN THE BRONX.

02:49.033 --> 02:50.600
- YEAH.

02:50.600 --> 02:51.700
HEY.

02:51.700 --> 02:52.833

02:53.967 --> 02:54.967
- BRACIOLE?

02:54.967 --> 02:56.833
- I'M IN.

02:56.833 --> 02:58.233
WHO MADE IT?
- DEBRA.

02:58.233 --> 03:00.867
- I'M OUT.

03:00.867 --> 03:03.033

I'LL TRY DEBRA'S BRACIOLE.

03:03.033 --> 03:05.433
I'M FILLED

COMIN' OFF AIRLINE FOOD.

03:23.167 --> 03:25.167
- IT'S AMAZING.
I MEAN, THAT IS AMAZING.

03:25.167 --> 03:27.100
- ARE YOU SURE
YOUR DEBRA MADE THIS?

03:27.100 --> 03:28.367
- I KNOW.
I KNOW.

03:28.367 --> 03:29.533
I COULDN'T
BELIEVE IT EITHER.

03:29.533 --> 03:30.767
SHE CAME UP
WITH SOME RECIPE.

03:30.767 --> 03:32.033
- RECIPE?

03:32.033 --> 03:33.333
- YEAH.
WHAT?

03:33.333 --> 03:36.967
- REAL COOKS
DON'T NEED RECIPES.

03:36.967 --> 03:39.000
WE KNOW HOW TO ADD LOVE
AND CARING,

03:39.000 --> 03:42.033
BECAUSE THERE'S NO GREATER JOY
THAN FEEDING OUR--

03:42.033 --> 03:43.033
- [smacking and moaning]

03:43.033 --> 03:45.967
- FRANK, YOU'RE A PIG.

03:45.967 --> 03:47.933
STOP MOANING.

03:47.933 --> 03:50.767
- SO DEBRA CAN NOW COOK.

03:50.767 --> 03:55.733
THE MISSING COLOR
IN THE RAYMOND RAINBOW.

03:55.733 --> 03:58.567
- AH, HA HA HA!

04:00.700 --> 04:05.000
- YOU SHOULD ASK DEBRA
HOW SHE MAKES THIS.

04:07.967 --> 04:09.700
- I SHOULD ASK DEBRA?

04:09.700 --> 04:11.167
[laughs]

04:11.167 --> 04:12.733
I SHOULD ASK DEBRA?

04:12.733 --> 04:13.800
[laughs]

04:13.800 --> 04:14.733
GIVE ME THAT!

04:33.033 --> 04:36.733
- THIS FOOD
HAS MAGICAL POWERS.

04:38.600 --> 04:42.133
I'M GONNA STRING
SOME OF THIS AROUND MY NECK.

04:46.433 --> 04:47.600
[knocking]

04:47.600 --> 04:48.600

04:48.600 --> 04:49.867

HE'S NOT HOME YET.

04:54.533 --> 04:55.800
HEY, YOU HUNGRY?

04:55.800 --> 04:58.167
- OH, SURE.
I COULD ALWAYS GO FOR SOMETHIN'.

04:58.167 --> 04:59.933
- I MADE SOME BRACIOLE.
TASTE IT.

04:59.933 --> 05:01.500
- OH, YOU MADE.

05:01.500 --> 05:02.933
UH...

05:02.933 --> 05:04.200
NO, NO, NO.

05:04.200 --> 05:06.633
I'M ACTUALLY--
I'M IN TRAINING.

05:06.633 --> 05:10.533
I'M IN TRAINING
FOR A RUNNING THING.

05:10.533 --> 05:11.333
- COME ON.

05:11.333 --> 05:12.700
- NO, NO.
REALLY.

05:12.700 --> 05:14.767
AND I'VE GONE KOSHER.

05:16.433 --> 05:18.467
I'M IN A JEWISH MARATHON.

05:18.467 --> 05:20.067
- OKAY.

05:20.067 --> 05:22.267
TRY IT, OKAY?
ONE BITE. ONE BITE.

05:22.267 --> 05:24.100
THAT'S IT.
ONE.

05:26.900 --> 05:28.933
- RUN AWAY WITH ME.

05:28.933 --> 05:31.200
- REALLY?
DO YOU LIKE IT?

05:31.200 --> 05:33.633
- OH, MY GOD.
IT'S FANTASTIC!

05:33.633 --> 05:34.933
- MMM!
DEBRA!

05:34.933 --> 05:35.933
- YEAH?

05:35.933 --> 05:37.467
- IT'S GREAT.

05:37.467 --> 05:39.633
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
RAY'S TALKIN' ABOUT.

05:41.200 --> 05:42.733
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
"TALKIN' ABOUT"?

05:42.733 --> 05:44.967
- NOTHING, HE WAS JUST TRYING
TO BE FUNNY AT WORK.

05:44.967 --> 05:46.567
- FUNNY?

05:46.567 --> 05:47.600
ABOUT THIS?

05:47.600 --> 05:49.600
WAS HE MAKING FUN
OF MY BRACIOLE?

05:54.067 --> 05:56.900
- NO, HE WAS NOT.

05:56.900 --> 05:58.233
- WAIT, ANDY.

05:58.233 --> 05:59.933
ANDY, HE TOLD ME
HE LOVED MY BRACIOLE.

05:59.933 --> 06:01.433
WHAT DID HE SAY
TO YOU ABOUT IT?

06:01.433 --> 06:03.433
- DID I EVER SHOW YOU
HOW I COULD WIGGLE MY EARS?

06:03.433 --> 06:04.967
LOOK AT THIS.
- ANDY, ANDY.

06:04.967 --> 06:06.167
WHAT DID HE SAY
ABOUT THE BRACIOLE?

06:06.167 --> 06:07.633
- I DID NOT FIND IT FUNNY.

06:07.633 --> 06:09.200
- ANDY!

06:09.200 --> 06:10.933
- HE SAID IT WAS ITALIAN
FOR "ROADKILL."

06:10.933 --> 06:12.100
PLEASE DON'T HURT ME.

06:14.767 --> 06:16.267
- ROADKILL?

06:16.267 --> 06:18.833
- HE WAS JUST KIDDING AROUND
LIKE HE ALWAYS DOES.

06:18.833 --> 06:20.900
- HE ALWAYS DOES THIS?

06:20.900 --> 06:23.267
- NO, NO.

06:23.267 --> 06:26.833
LISTEN, I HAD
SOME THERAFLU EARLIER,

06:26.833 --> 06:29.233
AND THEN I REALIZED
I DO NOT EVEN HAVE THE FLU,

06:29.233 --> 06:33.200
SO I'M REALLY FLYIN'.
WHOO-HOO-HOO-HOO.

06:33.200 --> 06:35.167

06:38.033 --> 06:39.900
FROM NOW ON,
YOU GET 'EM ON YOUR OWN.

06:39.900 --> 06:41.767
I'M TIRED OF THIS!

06:52.533 --> 06:55.633
- ARE YOU SLEEPIN' WITH ANDY?
'CAUSE YOU CAN DO BETTER.

06:59.033 --> 07:00.733
- [chuckles]

07:00.733 --> 07:01.767
THAT'S FUNNY.

07:01.767 --> 07:02.767

07:02.767 --> 07:04.933
HEY, WHAT SMELLS GOOD?

07:04.933 --> 07:06.500

07:06.500 --> 07:07.900
YOU KNOW, 'CAUSE YOU
LIKED IT SO MUCH.

07:07.900 --> 07:09.500
- YES, I DO.

07:09.500 --> 07:11.267
[chuckling]

07:11.267 --> 07:13.633
ALL THE COLORS
IN THE RAINBOW

07:16.000 --> 07:18.100
OH, THAT SMELLS GOOD.

07:18.100 --> 07:21.567
[singing] DEBRA MADE
SOMETHING GOOD.

07:21.567 --> 07:22.600
WHA-WHA.

07:22.600 --> 07:24.700
WHA-WHA-WHA.

07:24.700 --> 07:27.567
RAYMOND
REALLY LIKES IT.

07:27.567 --> 07:29.633
YEAH-HAH.

07:31.500 --> 07:35.833
YOU AIN'T GOT
TO MAKE NOTHIN' ELSE

07:35.833 --> 07:37.433
BUT THAT BRACIOLE.

07:37.433 --> 07:40.700
AH-OOH AH-OOH
AH-OOH AH-OOH AH-OOH.

07:43.600 --> 07:44.800
I COULD

07:44.800 --> 07:46.567
EAT THIS STUFF

07:46.567 --> 07:48.100
UNTIL I

07:48.100 --> 07:50.467
LOSE CONTROL.

07:50.467 --> 07:51.367
WHOOKEE-HAH.

07:51.367 --> 07:54.233

WHOOKIE-HAH-AH.

07:55.633 --> 07:58.600

FOR YOUR ROADKILL.

08:12.567 --> 08:14.467
- WHOO.

08:18.767 --> 08:21.300
WHAH.

08:23.600 --> 08:25.833
YOU KNOW,
YOU COULD'VE JUST SAID,

08:25.833 --> 08:27.733
"PLEASE DON'T SING."

08:38.900 --> 08:40.267
- FOOD HERE IS GOOD.

08:40.267 --> 08:43.000
I MIGHT HAVE A COMMENT
ABOUT THE SERVICE.

08:44.467 --> 08:47.033
- OH, IS THAT WHAT YOU DO
AT WORK?

08:47.033 --> 08:48.567
YOU MAKE FUN OF ME
ALL DAY?

08:48.567 --> 08:49.367
- WHAT?
NO. NO!

08:49.367 --> 08:50.533
IS THAT WHAT ANDY SAID?

08:50.533 --> 08:52.233
OH, WHY THE HELL
WOULD HE SAY THAT?

08:52.233 --> 08:54.433
- I DON'T KNOW, BUT HE ACTUALLY
LOVED MY BRACIOLE.

08:54.433 --> 08:56.367
- LOOK, I LOVE YOUR BRACIOLE!

08:56.367 --> 08:57.467
COME ON!

08:57.467 --> 08:58.800
IT'S THE BEST THING
YOU EVER MADE!

08:58.800 --> 09:00.133
- OH, BALONEY!

09:00.133 --> 09:01.533
HOW COME YOU TOLD EVERYBODY
IT WAS ROADKILL?

09:01.533 --> 09:03.567
- THAT'S A JOKE.
- OH, NO, IT'S NOT!

09:03.567 --> 09:05.233
- OF COURSE IT IS.
COME ON, I WAS JUST KIDDING.

09:05.233 --> 09:07.033
COME ON, YOU SEE
HOW MUCH I LOVE IT.

09:12.333 --> 09:14.433
I COULD USE A TOWEL.

09:17.167 --> 09:19.233
- HELLO, DEBRA.

09:29.100 --> 09:30.600
- WHAT IS IT, FRANK?

09:30.600 --> 09:31.767
- NOTHING, DEAR.

09:31.767 --> 09:33.200
I WAS JUST WONDERING
IF THERE'S ANY

09:33.200 --> 09:35.433
OF YOUR DELICIOUS
BRACIOLE LEFT.

09:35.433 --> 09:37.100
OH, OH,
THESE ARE FOR YOU.

09:38.400 --> 09:41.133
- OH, DAD, NOT NOW, PLEASE,
ALL RIGHT?

09:41.133 --> 09:44.267
- HEY, YOU GOT
A LITTLE SPOT THERE.

09:47.267 --> 09:48.500
I'M TELLIN' YOU, DEBRA.

09:48.500 --> 09:50.800
THAT STUFF YOU MADE
IS SO GREAT,

09:50.800 --> 09:53.267
I WOKE UP THINKIN' ABOUT IT.

09:53.267 --> 09:55.967
IS, UH, ANYBODY
EATING THIS?

09:55.967 --> 09:57.100
- NO, FRANK.

09:57.100 --> 09:59.800
YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU CAN HAVE IT.

09:59.800 --> 10:01.367
AT LEAST SOMEONE
APPRECIATES IT.

10:01.367 --> 10:02.633
- HEY,
I APPRECIATE--

10:02.633 --> 10:04.500
- THANK YOU FOR THE FLOWERS,
FRANK.

10:04.500 --> 10:06.167
- ANYONE WHO CAN MAKE
BRACIOLE LIKE THIS

10:06.167 --> 10:07.500
DESERVES A WHOLE HILLSIDE

10:07.500 --> 10:11.200
FULL OF HEAVENLY SCENTED
MARIGOLDS AND DAFFODILS.

10:18.567 --> 10:19.867
- I HAPPEN
TO AGREE WITH THAT.

10:19.867 --> 10:20.867
- THAT'S VERY SWEET, FRANK.

10:20.867 --> 10:22.333
THAT'S VERY SWEET.

10:22.333 --> 10:23.767
THAT'S THE NICEST THING
ANYONE'S SAID TO ME

10:23.767 --> 10:25.033
IN QUITE SOME TIME.

10:25.033 --> 10:26.533
WOULD YOU LIKE
SOMETHING TO DRINK?

10:26.533 --> 10:29.567
- NO, NO, I DON'T WANT
TO DILUTE THE FLAVOR.

10:29.567 --> 10:30.767
PLEASE SIT DOWN.

10:30.767 --> 10:33.200
YOU SHOULD BE RESTING
WITH YOUR FEET UP.

10:35.300 --> 10:36.533
- THANK YOU, FRANK.

10:36.533 --> 10:38.000
- ALL RIGHT.
ALL RIGHT, COME ON.

10:38.000 --> 10:39.733
- OH, WHAT'S THE MATTER,
RAY, HMM?

10:39.733 --> 10:42.967
IS IT SO WEIRD THAT I'M BEING
APPRECIATED INSTEAD OF MOCKED?

10:42.967 --> 10:44.133
- IS THAT I HOW I RAISED YOU?

10:44.133 --> 10:46.367
- YEAH.
OKAY, DAD!

10:49.633 --> 10:51.400
- MMM!

10:51.400 --> 10:53.233
THIS IS SO DELICIOUS.

10:53.233 --> 10:55.000
YOU REALLY GOT IT, KID.

10:55.000 --> 10:56.433
- DO YOU REALLY THINK SO?

10:56.433 --> 10:58.933
- THERE'S JUST, LIKE,
A SWEETNESS TO IT.

10:58.933 --> 11:00.267
HOW DO YOU DO THAT?

11:00.267 --> 11:02.067
- WELL, YOU KNOW,
SOME PEOPLE USE RAISINS,

11:02.067 --> 11:03.600
BUT I HAD SOME CURRANTS.

11:03.600 --> 11:05.367
- WELL, THIS IS
A BEAUTIFUL THING.

11:05.367 --> 11:07.033
- THANK YOU, FRANK.

11:38.633 --> 11:41.700
- I THOUGHT YOU
WERE TAKING A BATH.

11:44.533 --> 11:45.867
- I WAS.

11:45.867 --> 11:47.467
I FINISHED.

11:47.467 --> 11:49.733
- OH.

11:51.100 --> 11:53.800
HOW WAS IT?

11:53.800 --> 11:55.800
- IT WAS FINE, FRANK.

11:55.800 --> 11:58.533
THANK YOU FOR MAKING IT
FOR ME.

11:58.533 --> 12:03.533
YOU HAVEN'T MADE A BATH
FOR ME IN 35 YEARS.

12:03.533 --> 12:05.167
- UH...

12:05.167 --> 12:08.233
YOU SEEMED TO NEED IT.

12:14.900 --> 12:17.167
LISTEN, MARIE, THIS IS NOT
WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE.

12:17.167 --> 12:19.533
- I'M NOT TALKING TO YOU.

12:19.533 --> 12:22.500
I DO HAVE A QUESTION
FOR DEBRA, HOWEVER.

12:22.500 --> 12:27.533
WHAT HAVE I DONE THAT YOU FEEL
THE NEED TO DESTROY ME?

12:27.533 --> 12:29.000
- WHAT?

12:29.000 --> 12:31.067
- WHO TOLD YOU
ABOUT BRACIOLE?

12:31.067 --> 12:34.133
- NOBODY.
I FOUND A RECIPE IN A MAGAZINE.

12:34.133 --> 12:35.933
- YOU FOUND A RECIPE.

12:35.933 --> 12:38.567
OH, YOU'RE A COOK NOW.

12:40.133 --> 12:42.200
FRANK NEVER MENTIONED
BRACIOLE TO YOU?

12:42.200 --> 12:43.600
- NO.
- NO.

12:43.600 --> 12:45.067
NO, I DIDN'T SAY
A THING, MARIE.

12:45.067 --> 12:47.400
- QUIET.

12:47.400 --> 12:49.300
- FRANK NEVER TOLD YOU
THAT BRACIOLE

12:49.300 --> 12:52.600
WAS THE VERY FIRST THING
I EVER COOKED FOR HIM?

12:52.600 --> 12:55.267
- OH, BOY.

12:55.267 --> 12:56.767
- NO.
I DIDN'T KNOW THAT.

12:56.767 --> 12:58.233
- YOU DIDN'T KNOW THAT.

12:58.233 --> 12:59.433
DO YOU KNOW
WHAT HE SAID TO ME

12:59.433 --> 13:03.433
WHEN HE TASTED MY BRACIOLE
IN 1955?

13:03.433 --> 13:07.633
HE SAID,
"BE MY BRIDE."

13:07.633 --> 13:08.800
- MARIE, COME ON!

13:08.800 --> 13:10.233
- "BE MY BRIDE," FRANK.

13:10.233 --> 13:11.367
"BE MY BRIDE."

13:11.367 --> 13:12.800
BUT IT'S VERY CLEAR NOW

13:12.800 --> 13:15.733
THAT YOU'LL GO TO ANY GIRL
WITH A POT!

13:23.200 --> 13:24.967
- YOU HARDLY MAKE IT
FOR ME ANYMORE!

13:24.967 --> 13:26.833
- 'CAUSE I DIDN'T WANT YOU
TO GET SICK OF IT.

13:26.833 --> 13:31.267
- I'M 64 YEARS OLD.
WHAT ARE YOU SAVIN' IT FOR?

13:40.400 --> 13:41.900
- MARIE, I'M SORRY.

13:41.900 --> 13:43.567
I DIDN'T KNOW
IT WAS YOUR SPECIAL DISH.

13:43.567 --> 13:45.267
- DON'T YOU HAVE
OTHER HOUSEHOLD THINGS

13:45.267 --> 13:47.933
THAT YOU NEED
TO TAKE CARE OF, LIKE...

13:47.933 --> 13:51.033
LIKE THE LAUNDRY?

13:52.667 --> 13:54.433
RAYMOND, GIVE ME THOSE PANTS.
I'LL WASH THEM.

13:54.433 --> 13:55.967
- THAT'S OKAY, MA.

13:55.967 --> 13:58.400
- NO, I'M WASHING THOSE PANTS
FOR YOU, DAMN IT!

13:58.400 --> 14:02.133
- MOM.
- TAKE OFF YOUR PANTS!

14:18.267 --> 14:20.633
- COULD WE TURN THE HEAT UP?

14:22.633 --> 14:24.633
- WHAT DO YOU WANT ME
TO SAY, MARIE?

14:24.633 --> 14:26.767
"I'M SORRY
I MADE BRACIOLE"?

14:26.767 --> 14:28.300
THIS IS INSANE.

14:28.300 --> 14:29.867
I NEVER WOULD HAVE MADE
THE STUFF IF I THOUGHT

14:29.867 --> 14:31.733
IT WAS GONNA TURN
EVERYBODY'S WORLD UPSIDE DOWN.

14:31.733 --> 14:36.533
- HEY, MA, I HAVE NOTHIN'
TO EAT OVER THERE.

14:36.533 --> 14:38.667
YOU SAID YOU
WERE MAKIN' ME DINNER.

14:38.667 --> 14:40.200
- I DON'T COOK ANYMORE.

14:40.200 --> 14:44.767
- ROBERT, HOW MUCH DOES RAY
MAKE FUN OF MY COOKING?

14:44.767 --> 14:47.233
DON'T LOOK AT HIM.

14:47.233 --> 14:49.967
DON'T YOU LOOK AT HIM, ROBERT.

14:49.967 --> 14:50.967
- HE'S NOT WEARING PANTS.

14:50.967 --> 14:52.633
- ANSWER ME!

14:56.200 --> 14:57.700
I KNOW HE MAKES FUN
OF MY COOKING.

14:57.700 --> 15:01.067
I WANT TO KNOW HOW MUCH OF IT
GOES ON BEHIND MY BACK.

15:05.700 --> 15:08.600
- HE MAKES FUN OF IT
ALL THE TIME, DEAR.

15:10.600 --> 15:12.567
- THAT IS NOT TRUE!

15:12.567 --> 15:16.533
THAT'S NOT COMPLETELY TRUE,
DEBRA!

15:18.600 --> 15:22.467
I LOVE YOUR BRACIOLE,
AND I AM NOT LYING TODAY!

15:25.033 --> 15:27.567
- IS THAT WHY
YOU'RE MAKING FUN OF IT,

15:27.567 --> 15:29.800
MAKING JOKES ABOUT IT
AT WORK?

15:29.800 --> 15:31.367
- YOU MAKE JOKES
ABOUT THIS FOOD?

15:31.367 --> 15:33.300
HAVE YOU NO DECENCY?

15:33.300 --> 15:34.733
- OH, STOP!
COME ON, DAD.

15:34.733 --> 15:36.533
IT'S JUST, YOU KNOW,
IT'S JUST...

15:36.533 --> 15:38.200
WIFE JOKES,
THAT'S ALL.

15:38.200 --> 15:39.833
IT'S SOMETHIN' YOU DO
WHEN YOU--

15:39.833 --> 15:42.433
YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU'RE
WITH THE GUYS.

15:42.433 --> 15:44.233
- I NEVER.

15:44.233 --> 15:45.800
- OH, YEAH, WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

15:45.800 --> 15:47.200
LIKE YOU DON'T MAKE JOKES?

15:47.200 --> 15:48.633
- FIRST OF ALL,

15:48.633 --> 15:50.233
IF I HAVE ANYTHING TO SAY
ABOUT YOUR MOTHER,

15:50.233 --> 15:54.133
I'M NOT AFRAID TO SAY IT
RIGHT TO HER FACE.

15:54.133 --> 15:57.133
SECOND OF ALL,
THOSE ARE NOT JOKES.

16:05.333 --> 16:09.167
- YESTERDAY,
YOU CALLED ME AN OLD BAG.

16:09.167 --> 16:12.667
- IF THAT'S A JOKE,
THEN IT'S ON ME.

16:12.667 --> 16:13.900
[laughs]

16:13.900 --> 16:16.333
RIGHT IN FRONT OF HER.

16:16.333 --> 16:19.100
- UH, YOU KNOW, ACTUALLY,
NOT TO DEFEND RAYMOND,

16:19.100 --> 16:20.733
THAT IS A GUY THING,
DEBRA.

16:20.733 --> 16:23.733
I'VE OFTEN FOUND
THAT MEN USE THE WIFE JOKE

16:23.733 --> 16:28.133
TO FORM BONDS AND SHARE
COMMON EXPERIENCES.

16:40.000 --> 16:43.767
AM I SITTING IN SAUCE?

16:43.767 --> 16:44.767
- YES, ROBERT.

16:44.767 --> 16:45.967
- GOOD.

16:45.967 --> 16:48.633
I WAS AFRAID
I POPPED A STITCH.

16:53.767 --> 16:57.800
- OH, ROBERT, COME ON.
TAKE OFF THOSE PANTS.

16:57.800 --> 16:58.900
- WHAT?

16:58.900 --> 16:59.900
- TAKE THEM OFF!

16:59.900 --> 17:00.900
- WELL, WHAT ARE YOU--

17:00.900 --> 17:02.267
- I GET THOSE PANTS!

17:02.267 --> 17:05.667
- DON'T FIGHT IT, MAN.
DON'T FIGHT IT.

17:05.667 --> 17:07.900
- COME ON, LET'S GO HOME.
I'LL CLEAN YOU UP.

17:07.900 --> 17:09.500
- ALL RIGHT.

17:13.800 --> 17:15.000
- THANKS, MA.

17:15.000 --> 17:16.033
- ARE YOU COMING OR NOT?

17:16.033 --> 17:17.400
- OF COURSE I'M COMING.

17:17.400 --> 17:20.333
YOU'RE MY WIFE.
I BELONG WITH YOU.

17:22.100 --> 17:24.033
I'M COMING!

17:24.033 --> 17:27.400
I'LL CALL YOU.

17:32.167 --> 17:35.800
- I'M GONNA GO...
FRESHEN UP.

17:35.800 --> 17:37.800
- RAY, CAN I TALK TO YOU?

17:37.800 --> 17:40.667
- YEAH, ALL RIGHT.

17:41.833 --> 17:44.533
I'M A LITTLE CHILLY.

17:44.533 --> 17:46.233
- WHY DO YOU HAVE TO MAKE
WIFE JOKES?

17:46.233 --> 17:48.133
I DON'T DO THAT.
I DON'T MAKE HUSBAND JOKES.

17:48.133 --> 17:49.700
- WELL, COME ON,
ARE YOU TELLIN' ME

17:49.700 --> 17:51.367
THAT YOU DON'T GO OUT
WITH AMY AND LINDA

17:51.367 --> 17:53.967
AND MAKE FUN OF ALL
THE STUPID THINGS I DO?

17:53.967 --> 17:57.933
YOU KNOW, YOU DON'T TALK ABOUT
THE WAY MY LIPS MOVE WHEN I READ

17:57.933 --> 18:02.233
OR YOU CAUGHT ME BITING
MY TOENAIL THAT ONE TIME OR...

18:02.233 --> 18:06.000
OR, UH...UH...

18:06.000 --> 18:07.500
- NO, I DON'T.

18:07.500 --> 18:09.100
IN FACT, I TRY TO SPIN IT
IN THE OTHER DIRECTION.

18:09.100 --> 18:10.967
LINDA THINKS
YOU HAVE A MASTER'S.

18:10.967 --> 18:12.867
- MASTER'S?

18:12.867 --> 18:13.867
- DEGREE.

18:13.867 --> 18:15.700
MASTER'S DEGREE, RAY.

18:15.700 --> 18:18.333
THIS IS WHAT
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

18:18.333 --> 18:19.667
YOU'RE ALWAYS MAKING FUN
OF MY COOKING,

18:19.667 --> 18:21.200
BUT I FINALLY MAKE
SOMETHING YOU LIKE,

18:21.200 --> 18:22.667
AND YOU'RE STILL
MAKING JOKES ABOUT IT.

18:22.667 --> 18:23.833
WHY?

18:23.833 --> 18:28.600
- I'M A COMPLICATED PERSON.

18:28.600 --> 18:31.133
COME ON, IT'S JUST--
THAT'S WHO I AM.

18:31.133 --> 18:33.167
I JUST--I MAKE FUN
OF THE WIFE A LITTLE.

18:33.167 --> 18:34.733
YOU KNOW,
"OH, OH, OH, HERE'S RAY.

18:34.733 --> 18:36.633
HEY, RAY, WHAT'D SHE DO
TO YOU LAST NIGHT?"

18:36.633 --> 18:37.800
AND THEN IF I SAY,

18:37.800 --> 18:40.433
"SHE MADE SOME BRACIOLE,
AND IT WAS QUITE TASTY,"

18:40.433 --> 18:43.800
WHOA, WHO WANTS TO HANG OUT
WITH THAT GUY.

18:43.800 --> 18:46.067
- BUT DON'T YOU THINK
THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG

18:46.067 --> 18:47.767
THAT THE ONLY WAY
YOU CAN BE POPULAR

18:47.767 --> 18:49.300
IS AT MY EXPENSE?

18:49.300 --> 18:52.033
- I WISH THERE WAS
ANOTHER WAY.

18:52.033 --> 18:53.900
- ALL RIGHT.

18:53.900 --> 18:55.900
- AW, COME ON.

18:55.900 --> 18:57.667
I'M KIDDING.

18:57.667 --> 18:59.500
COME ON, HEY, LOOK,
WE KNOW THE SCORE HERE.

18:59.500 --> 19:01.533
YOU GOT IT ALL OVER ME,
RIGHT?

19:01.533 --> 19:05.633
YOU'RE THE PRETTY, SMART,
TOGETHER, GOOD ONE.

19:05.633 --> 19:08.800
I'M THE ONE THEY SAY,
"HOW DID HE GET HER?"

19:08.800 --> 19:11.300
SO I DON'T KNOW,
MAYBE IN MY STUPID WAY,

19:11.300 --> 19:13.800
I'M TELLING THEM HOW,
YOU KNOW?

19:13.800 --> 19:17.033
"SHE CAN'T COOK.
HA, HA!"

19:18.000 --> 19:21.567
HA, HA, HA, HA, HA.

19:21.567 --> 19:23.267
WHAT?
IT COULD BE WORSE.

19:23.267 --> 19:24.767
YOU KNOW--
YOU KNOW CHUCK WILSON?

19:24.767 --> 19:26.367
YOU KNOW
WHAT HE TOLD ME?

19:26.367 --> 19:29.367
HE SAID HIS WIFE IS SO COLD,
WHEN HE GETS INTO BED WITH HER,

19:29.367 --> 19:32.500
HE HAS TO SHOO AWAY
THE PENGUINS.

19:37.767 --> 19:41.233
SHOO AWAY THE PENGUINS.

19:41.233 --> 19:43.000
THAT'S COLD...

19:43.000 --> 19:44.667
WILSON'S WIFE.

19:46.200 --> 19:51.467
AND YET, I DON'T THINK
ANY LESS OF HER.

19:51.467 --> 19:54.333
- I DON'T CARE WHAT
THE OTHER GUYS THINK ABOUT ME.

19:54.333 --> 19:57.067
I CARE WHAT YOU
THINK ABOUT ME.

20:03.600 --> 20:05.933
- I'M NOT GONNA MAKE JOKES
ANYMORE.

20:05.933 --> 20:09.000
- THANK YOU.

20:09.000 --> 20:12.033
- YOU STILL GONNA COOK
FOR ME?

20:12.033 --> 20:14.333
- YES.

20:14.333 --> 20:17.733
- YOU WANT TO TAKE
YOUR PANTS OFF?

20:22.133 --> 20:24.000
- NO.

20:25.400 --> 20:28.100
- OKAY THEN,
CAN I HAVE MORE SAUCE?

20:30.067 --> 20:31.833
OH, COME ON!

20:31.833 --> 20:33.933
COME ON.

20:33.933 --> 20:35.433
COME ON.

20:44.133 --> 20:46.267
- HEY.

20:46.267 --> 20:47.833
WHAT ARE YOU DOIN'?

20:47.833 --> 20:51.167
- I'M HAVING SOME TEA.

20:54.067 --> 20:55.833
- DIDN'T MAKE ANY DINNER?

20:55.833 --> 20:57.400
- YES.

20:57.400 --> 20:59.067
TEA.

21:01.700 --> 21:03.067
- OH.

21:03.067 --> 21:07.133
- AND WHAT DID DEBRA
MAKE TONIGHT?

21:07.133 --> 21:09.867
- LASAGNA.

21:09.867 --> 21:12.533
IT'S OVER.

21:14.633 --> 21:16.133
- WHAT?

21:16.133 --> 21:21.733
- I THINK THE BRACIOLE
IS ALL SHE CAN MAKE.

21:21.733 --> 21:26.233
LISTEN, MARIE,
I LEARNED SOMETHING.

21:26.233 --> 21:30.900
A MAN NEEDS MORE
THAN BRACIOLE.

21:30.900 --> 21:33.167
A MAN NEEDS...

21:33.167 --> 21:36.467
CHICKEN...

21:36.467 --> 21:39.700
VEAL,
EGGPLANT PARMESAN.

21:39.700 --> 21:41.000
- MANICOTTI?

21:41.000 --> 21:44.000
- YES.

21:44.000 --> 21:45.033
MANICOTTI.

21:45.033 --> 21:47.700
- OH, FRANK!

21:47.700 --> 21:50.667
OH!

21:50.667 --> 21:52.300
[laughter]

21:52.300 --> 21:54.500
AND, FRANK?
- YES?

21:54.500 --> 21:57.100
WE'LL NEVER SPEAK
OF THIS AGAIN.
