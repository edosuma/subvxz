<i>Air and naval

00:11.741 --> 00:14.576

00:22.485 --> 00:26.551
<i>The</i> USS Cole <i>was attacked...</i>

00:26.619 --> 00:28.485
This was an act of terrorism.

00:28.552 --> 00:31.053
It was a despicable
and cowardly act.

00:31.121 --> 00:32.820
The next song we're gonna play

00:32.888 --> 00:34.688
for you is one
of the good ol' favorites.

00:34.756 --> 00:37.188
Until something shocks him...

00:37.256 --> 00:40.590
<i>I'm just making sure</i>
<i>we don't get hit again.</i>

00:40.658 --> 00:43.594
That plane crashed into
the World Trade Center.

00:46.135 --> 00:47.235
Running up...

00:47.303 --> 00:50.909

01:03.626 --> 01:06.816

01:08.739 --> 01:10.032
<i>It was ten years ago.</i>

01:10.141 --> 01:12.706
- Everyone misses something.
- Everyone is not me.

01:24.146 --> 01:26.380
<i>Previously on</i> Homeland...

01:26.448 --> 01:27.715
What were his exact words?

01:27.783 --> 01:30.487
<i>"An American prisoner of war</i>
<i>has been turned."</i>

01:30.555 --> 01:31.822
I'm an American.

01:31.890 --> 01:33.591
<i>If he is a terrorist,</i>

01:33.659 --> 01:34.959
we need eyes and ears

01:35.028 --> 01:36.963
<i>on Brody from the minute</i>
<i>he steps off that plane.</i>

01:37.031 --> 01:38.799
Out of the question.

01:38.866 --> 01:40.268
How long before you're set up?

01:40.336 --> 01:41.736
The feed will be live
by the time Sergeant Brody

01:41.804 --> 01:43.071
gets back to his house.

01:44.207 --> 01:45.808
Hello, Big Brother.

01:45.876 --> 01:47.911
Ready for you, Sergeant
Brody, your debriefing.

01:47.979 --> 01:48.979
I want to call my wife first.

01:49.047 --> 01:50.815
Jessica, it's me.

01:55.756 --> 01:57.291
Pleased to meet you.

01:58.860 --> 02:00.495
Hug him, Chris.

02:01.563 --> 02:03.431
Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

02:03.499 --> 02:05.134
I want to say thank you
to my family

02:05.202 --> 02:07.436
for their strength
in my absence.

02:07.504 --> 02:09.639
Three days ago, we were
about to tell your kids.

02:09.705 --> 02:11.475
He's my husband, Mike.

02:11.543 --> 02:14.811
Abu Nazir? Was he present during
any of your interrogations?

02:14.879 --> 02:15.779
No.

02:17.215 --> 02:19.984
I didn't think that this was
any of my business.

02:20.052 --> 02:21.952
Now I'm thinking that it is.
Just tell me

02:22.020 --> 02:23.454
I'm not out here
risking federal prison

02:23.521 --> 02:24.722
on behalf of a crazy person.

02:24.789 --> 02:26.456
You know, maybe it is
all in my head,

02:26.524 --> 02:28.458
but you're in it now, Virgil,
up to your fucking neck!

02:28.526 --> 02:31.128
You think for one minute
you get away with this?

02:31.195 --> 02:32.662
I thought that once
I had some proof...

02:32.730 --> 02:34.664
Do you have any?
You've been suggesting

02:34.732 --> 02:35.966
that Sergeant Brody's
what you think he is.

02:36.033 --> 02:36.966
No.

02:37.034 --> 02:38.034
Then get a lawyer.

02:38.102 --> 02:39.702
I missed something once before,

02:39.770 --> 02:42.673
I won't... I can't let
that happen again!

02:42.741 --> 02:44.008
It was ten years ago.

02:44.075 --> 02:45.343
Everyone missed
something that day.

02:45.410 --> 02:46.911
It's a pattern.

02:46.979 --> 02:48.480
Okay, do you see?

02:48.547 --> 02:50.015
He's making contact, Saul.
He's sending

02:50.083 --> 02:51.150
a message to somebody.

02:51.217 --> 02:54.186
<i>A handler,</i>
<i>a sleeper cell, somebody.</i>

02:54.254 --> 02:55.688
So am I still going to jail?

02:55.756 --> 02:57.690

04:37.930 --> 04:39.865
You want some coffee?

04:39.933 --> 04:42.367
Dana, Chris, come on!
We're gonna be late!

04:42.435 --> 04:44.836
Coming!

04:44.904 --> 04:46.438
First day at work and they're
gonna make me late.

04:46.506 --> 04:50.274
You want some eggs before I go?
Hey.

04:50.342 --> 04:52.443
Hey, slow down.

04:52.511 --> 04:54.378
Mom, I can't find my socks!

04:54.446 --> 04:56.513
Sausage, I think
we have sausage.

04:56.581 --> 04:58.482
Happened again, didn't it?

04:58.550 --> 05:01.319
Look in the dryer!

05:01.386 --> 05:02.887
Dana, can you please help him?

05:02.955 --> 05:04.622
Yeah.

05:04.689 --> 05:06.557
Around 4:00 a.m. this morning.

05:06.625 --> 05:07.859
You were yelling something

05:07.927 --> 05:09.361
that sounded like Arabic
over and over.

05:09.428 --> 05:12.565
You grabbed my arm really hard.

05:12.632 --> 05:13.899
You wouldn't let go.

05:15.603 --> 05:18.138
Jesus.

05:18.206 --> 05:19.139
Show me.

05:31.584 --> 05:33.051
Hey, Mom, Dad.

05:37.889 --> 05:39.756
They're still out there.

05:39.824 --> 05:41.724
Do they stay out
there all night,

05:41.792 --> 05:43.526
even when we're sleeping?

05:48.799 --> 05:51.167
You forgot to flush again,
you little douche.

05:51.234 --> 05:52.368
Dana, language.

05:52.435 --> 05:53.669
"Douche" is not a bad word.

05:53.737 --> 05:55.204
Don't answer that!

05:55.272 --> 05:56.839
Hello?

05:58.608 --> 06:00.042
CBS News.

06:00.110 --> 06:01.944
Third time this week.

06:02.012 --> 06:02.945
Tell 'em I'm not here.

06:03.013 --> 06:04.880
He says he's not here.

06:11.921 --> 06:14.689
Hey, I thought
you didn't want to be late.

06:16.826 --> 06:18.393
I know, maybe I should take
another day off.

06:18.460 --> 06:19.927
Hey, all those years

06:19.995 --> 06:22.697
on my own, Jess, I think I can
handle one more day.

06:22.765 --> 06:24.366
All right? Go on.

06:24.434 --> 06:25.868
Get out of here.

06:27.838 --> 06:30.106
All right, come on, you guys.

06:30.174 --> 06:32.609
Come on,
come on, come on, come on.

07:11.215 --> 07:13.783
Hello? Hello?

07:20.091 --> 07:21.625
Hello?

07:23.595 --> 07:24.595
Hello?

07:24.662 --> 07:26.597
<i>Hello!</i>

07:26.664 --> 07:28.198
Hello?!

07:38.443 --> 07:39.477
There he is!

07:39.544 --> 07:41.212
Brody, how does it feel
to be free?

07:41.279 --> 07:42.212
Is it true
you're gonna reenlist?

07:42.280 --> 07:43.780
Are you going to reenlist?

07:43.848 --> 07:45.849
Would you ever go back
out there, Sergeant?

07:45.917 --> 07:48.819
How does it feel
to be home again, sir?

07:48.887 --> 07:50.454
Sir, are you going to reenlist?

08:59.428 --> 09:02.463
<i>I've been going over</i>
<i>Brody's finger tapping</i>

09:02.531 --> 09:05.966
with the crypto team,
and I hate to say it, Saul,

09:06.034 --> 09:08.535
but there's little, if any,
repeat pattern combination.

09:08.602 --> 09:11.404
Not even a quadratic basis
to work with here.

09:11.471 --> 09:14.573
I'll keep trying as long as
you need, but there's nothing

09:14.641 --> 09:16.041
definitive one way
or the other yet.

09:16.109 --> 09:18.310
Keep looking.

09:18.378 --> 09:20.913
I want to leave no
stone unturned on this.

09:20.980 --> 09:22.682
We'll talk later.

09:28.389 --> 09:31.325
What do you think?

09:31.392 --> 09:33.060
Oh, definitely an original...

09:33.128 --> 09:36.664
by one of the preeminent
Dutch painters of his time.

09:36.731 --> 09:39.667
Relatively recent acquisition,
if I'm not mistaken.

09:39.735 --> 09:41.435
By an artist who,
as it turns out,

09:41.503 --> 09:42.903
was not only Dutch

09:42.971 --> 09:44.605
but also Jewish.

09:44.673 --> 09:46.006
In a club with
no Jewish members.

09:46.074 --> 09:47.774
That was your point, wasn't it?

09:50.344 --> 09:51.511
How do you take it?

09:53.981 --> 09:57.249
Your Honor, I'm not
asking for anything

09:57.317 --> 09:58.818
that hasn't been granted

09:58.885 --> 10:01.086
many thousands of times over
in the last ten years.

10:01.154 --> 10:05.024
A surveillance warrant
on an unspecified subject

10:05.092 --> 10:07.961
on American soil-- if this
were a standard request,

10:08.028 --> 10:10.797
you'd go through standard
procedure, Saul.

10:10.865 --> 10:13.767
In this case, I don't have time

10:13.835 --> 10:15.970
for a government lawyer
to petition the court.

10:16.037 --> 10:19.541
So you're asking me to issue
a FISA warrant directly to...

10:19.608 --> 10:22.945
What is it exactly do you do
at Langley these days?

10:23.012 --> 10:25.880
Among other things,
pay house calls

10:25.948 --> 10:27.816
to those I'd prefer
not to have to...

10:27.884 --> 10:29.284
strong arm?

10:29.351 --> 10:32.287
Disturb.

10:36.059 --> 10:38.961
Are you ever gonna let me off
your hook, Saul?

10:39.029 --> 10:42.064
Well...

10:42.132 --> 10:46.135
We both know you're far too fine
a judge for that, Geoffrey.

10:46.202 --> 10:49.405
Can we at least act like
this is about the law

10:49.472 --> 10:54.076
rather than a brief moment
of weakness in my past?

10:54.144 --> 10:57.146
This is absolutely about
the law, Your Honor.

10:57.213 --> 10:59.048
Hmm.

11:16.568 --> 11:18.468
Shit.

11:26.311 --> 11:28.245
<i>Hey, Maggie, it's me.</i>

11:28.313 --> 11:30.681
Sorry I haven't called
in a while; I been slammed.

11:30.749 --> 11:33.550
Um, thought I'll come see
you guys for a night,

11:33.618 --> 11:34.952
if that's good with you.

11:35.020 --> 11:36.954
Uh... call me back.
Let me know.

11:37.022 --> 11:38.389
Thanks. Bye.

11:48.600 --> 11:50.100
I've got a doorbell, you know?

11:50.168 --> 11:51.601
Well, you think you still have

11:51.669 --> 11:53.637
a right to privacy
with all this?

11:53.705 --> 11:55.739
My God, look at this place.

11:58.109 --> 12:00.043
It's broken--

12:00.111 --> 12:02.045
the doorbell.

12:02.113 --> 12:03.546
What's that?

12:03.614 --> 12:05.115
This gives you four weeks.

12:05.183 --> 12:06.983
You got a warrant?
A FISA warrant?

12:07.051 --> 12:08.418
We're legal now?

12:08.486 --> 12:12.055
Legal-ish, but far
from official,

12:12.123 --> 12:14.758
and certainly
not Estes-proof.

12:14.825 --> 12:17.594
Be very careful not to mistake
this for a stamp of approval,

12:17.662 --> 12:18.995
or sanction from me

12:19.063 --> 12:21.164
for you to wage some
sort of personal war.

12:21.232 --> 12:23.333
Eyes on Brody makes
complete sense.

12:23.400 --> 12:25.635
It's exactly what you'd have
done in my shoes, Saul.

12:25.703 --> 12:26.970
No, it is not.

12:29.740 --> 12:32.675
You lied to me
about it, Carrie.

12:32.743 --> 12:35.578
Then right here in this room,
when I called you on it...

12:35.646 --> 12:37.012
I know what I did.

12:37.080 --> 12:39.481
And I know it was wrong...

12:39.549 --> 12:41.483
and insulting.

12:41.551 --> 12:43.018
Insulting...

12:43.086 --> 12:46.021
and barely scratches
the surface of what that was.

12:48.657 --> 12:49.991
Four weeks, Carrie.

12:50.058 --> 12:51.325
Not a second longer.

12:51.393 --> 12:53.160
I want to show you something.

12:58.566 --> 12:59.666
He has nightmares.

12:59.734 --> 13:01.335
Where he repeatedly begs

13:01.402 --> 13:03.637
someone to kill him, in Arabic.

13:03.705 --> 13:06.374
He's too ashamed or scared
or both to face the press

13:06.442 --> 13:07.876
outside his house or take calls

13:07.943 --> 13:09.477
from the TV news,
so what does he do?

13:09.545 --> 13:11.479
He finds shelter in the
corner of the bedroom,

13:11.547 --> 13:13.715
where he hasn't moved
in over five hours.

13:13.783 --> 13:15.384
All of which makes
complete sense

13:15.451 --> 13:17.052
after eight years of captivity.

13:17.120 --> 13:18.520
But what if it's
more than that?

13:24.127 --> 13:26.461
If-if Brody had really
been turned, as you say,

13:26.529 --> 13:29.164
you know what he'd more
likely be doing by now?

13:29.231 --> 13:31.899
Talking to the press
outside his house,

13:31.967 --> 13:33.467
doing TV interviews,

13:33.535 --> 13:36.470
playing the hero card
for every penny it's worth.

13:36.538 --> 13:39.006
Maybe it's not that simple
for him.

13:39.074 --> 13:41.842
Get some sleep, Carrie.

13:41.910 --> 13:45.180
No one said becoming a terrorist
was easy, Saul.

13:45.248 --> 13:47.149
If you'd been taken prisoner,

13:47.217 --> 13:48.817
tortured for God knows how long

13:48.885 --> 13:51.220
and somehow,
finally been turned,

13:51.288 --> 13:52.889
then, one day, you come home,

13:52.957 --> 13:55.759
and suddenly it's real, it's on!

13:55.826 --> 13:57.761
Well, that's one interpretation.

13:57.828 --> 13:59.763
But that's all it is
at the moment.

13:59.831 --> 14:02.165
Clean your apartment.

14:02.232 --> 14:03.900
And eat some real food.

14:24.486 --> 14:26.420
Raised in Colorado Springs,

14:26.487 --> 14:28.455
attended BYU,

14:28.523 --> 14:31.191
interests,
finance, travel, men.

14:31.259 --> 14:33.460
Stacey Moore,
this is Latif Bin Walid,

14:33.527 --> 14:35.796
Majordomo for his Highness,
Prince Farid.

14:35.864 --> 14:37.798
Please continue.

14:37.865 --> 14:40.734
Would you say you're outgoing,
or more the quiet type, Stacey?

14:40.802 --> 14:42.536
I'd say more outgoing.

14:42.604 --> 14:43.870
Definitely social.

14:43.938 --> 14:47.541
I like to party,
if that's what you mean.

14:47.608 --> 14:48.575
Do you drink?

14:48.643 --> 14:51.878
I'm not a drinker, per se,

14:51.946 --> 14:53.647
if that's what you mean.

14:53.714 --> 14:56.316
Stacey...

14:56.383 --> 14:59.319
You are interviewing for a job
that pays, in two years,

14:59.386 --> 15:01.954
more than most people
in this country earn in 20.

15:02.022 --> 15:04.157
If you're successful
in this interview,

15:04.225 --> 15:06.559
you'll be required to appear
self-possessed, confident,

15:06.627 --> 15:09.496
modest and reticent
all at the same time.

15:09.564 --> 15:11.498
So, stop asking what I mean.

15:11.566 --> 15:13.133
Think and answer for yourself.

15:15.837 --> 15:17.905
Do you enjoy anal sex?

15:17.973 --> 15:20.408
Excuse me?

15:23.012 --> 15:24.913
How about other women?

15:26.015 --> 15:27.949
Sure.

15:28.017 --> 15:29.317
Both.

15:29.385 --> 15:32.654
Have you ever dated
any famous men?

15:32.722 --> 15:36.191
That's none of your business.

15:43.734 --> 15:46.369
You need to wax that, sweetie.

15:46.436 --> 15:48.971
Hair down there's not an option
for His Highness.

15:52.576 --> 15:54.010
Very nice.

15:54.077 --> 15:56.012
You're through
the final interview.

15:56.080 --> 15:57.847
We'll contact you
within the next week.

15:57.915 --> 16:00.283
Congratulations,
and you can get dressed now.

16:03.788 --> 16:05.221
Who are you calling?

16:05.289 --> 16:06.723
My aesthetician.

16:06.791 --> 16:09.126
I, too, need a wax
before the prince gets in.

16:10.795 --> 16:14.432
Feel free to book the
appointment for me, if you like.

16:18.703 --> 16:20.371
Music.

16:20.438 --> 16:22.206
Mm-hmm. On hold.

16:22.274 --> 16:24.508
Kenny G.
Welcome to America.

16:24.576 --> 16:26.144
Gimme.

16:26.211 --> 16:30.148
Would you mind selecting the
next girl to come in, please?

16:32.885 --> 16:35.354
Come on, pick up, pick up.

16:36.756 --> 16:38.490
Hi. This is Lynne Reed.

16:38.558 --> 16:40.025
Two E's.

16:40.093 --> 16:43.028
I was referred by one
of her clients, Carrie.

16:43.096 --> 16:44.596
Yes, that's her.

16:44.664 --> 16:47.933
I need to book a Brazilian wax
for noon tomorrow.

16:48.001 --> 16:50.769
Right. No-- that's the only time
I can do it.

16:50.837 --> 16:52.204
Okay, noon it is.

16:52.272 --> 16:54.006
We'll see you then.

16:59.479 --> 17:00.846
Hello.

17:00.914 --> 17:02.047
Carrie, it's Yvonne Marshall.

17:02.115 --> 17:03.182
I'm the duty officer tonight.

17:03.249 --> 17:04.517
Hi, Yvonne. What is it?

17:04.584 --> 17:05.884
You have an asset
in from the cold.

17:05.952 --> 17:07.286
Booked a treatment tomorrow

17:07.353 --> 17:08.854
at the Yara Spa in Georgetown.

17:08.922 --> 17:10.957
Lynne Reed?
That's right. She used your

17:11.023 --> 17:13.092
first name as a reference
and made a noon appointment.

17:13.160 --> 17:14.894
Noon?

17:14.962 --> 17:16.729
Ar-Are you sure she said noon?

17:16.797 --> 17:18.263
That was the only time
she could make it.

17:20.267 --> 17:21.601
Okay. Thanks, Yvonne.

17:33.850 --> 17:35.217
Hi.

17:35.285 --> 17:37.787
Mm. How was school?
Okay.

17:37.855 --> 17:40.657
Is Dad here?
Don't know.

17:40.725 --> 17:44.661
If you want to help, you
can start unpacking those for me.

17:58.843 --> 18:00.177
Hey.

18:00.245 --> 18:01.779
Hey.

18:01.847 --> 18:03.380
How was your day?

18:04.682 --> 18:07.351
Great.

18:30.075 --> 18:32.143
Oh. Hope
you don't mind, Mike.

18:32.211 --> 18:35.046
We helped ourselves
to some of your hooch.

18:37.883 --> 18:39.817
Thought we would
stop by for a...

18:39.884 --> 18:42.320
for a situation report
on Sergeant Brody.

18:51.598 --> 18:53.899
Situation report
on Brody is this:

18:53.967 --> 18:55.735
He's been back three days,

18:55.803 --> 18:57.971
and it's gonna take a little
more time until he's willing

18:58.038 --> 19:00.006
to come out of his shell,
let alone his house.

19:00.074 --> 19:02.475
The man represents a significant
victory in the war on terror,

19:02.543 --> 19:04.478
thanks to our friends
at the CIA.

19:04.545 --> 19:06.480
I'm putting aside
for the moment

19:06.548 --> 19:08.482
that Sergeant Brody
owes them his life.

19:08.550 --> 19:10.083
These are the facts:

19:10.151 --> 19:11.352
Bin Laden's dead...

19:11.419 --> 19:13.854
and America thinks,
or wants to think,

19:13.922 --> 19:15.756
that this war is
drawing to an end.

19:15.824 --> 19:17.191
Politicians are pushing for a

19:17.258 --> 19:19.059
wholesale withdrawal
from Afghanistan.

19:19.127 --> 19:21.228
But as we all know, Captain,

19:21.296 --> 19:23.230
the terrorists
are still out there--

19:23.297 --> 19:25.032
after blood.

19:25.099 --> 19:27.034
We need Brody in the public eye,

19:27.102 --> 19:29.203
reminding America
that this is far from over.

19:29.270 --> 19:33.172
What if he's not up for it...
psychologically?

19:33.240 --> 19:34.774
Fuck it.

19:34.842 --> 19:36.242
Drive on.

19:36.310 --> 19:38.611
Isn't that what
you Marines say?

19:38.678 --> 19:41.680
In combat, where we also shit
in Saran Wrap and shoot to kill.

19:41.748 --> 19:43.348
You want Brody to do that, too?

19:43.416 --> 19:45.518
Don't take that tone
with me, Captain.

19:45.586 --> 19:47.887
Career pencil-pusher, with
his brown nose in my scotch

19:47.955 --> 19:49.889
saying, "Fuck it, drive on."

19:49.957 --> 19:53.060
You're a captain in the
United States Marines.

19:53.128 --> 19:56.364
You mean to tell me you can't
give a sergeant a direct order?

19:56.432 --> 19:58.866
Is that what you want me
to report up the chain?

19:58.934 --> 20:00.368
Look, Mike, I get it.

20:00.436 --> 20:02.070
You and Brody are
friends, right?

20:02.138 --> 20:03.905
By the way,

20:03.973 --> 20:06.141
how's his wife Jennifer doing?

20:06.208 --> 20:07.609
Jessica.

20:11.714 --> 20:14.383
If not for us, Brody should
at least do it for her.

20:14.451 --> 20:15.918
For the kids.

20:15.986 --> 20:18.387
And I'm sure you're
more than familiar

20:18.454 --> 20:20.389
with their current
financial problems.

20:20.457 --> 20:23.492
DOD's offering a very generous
reenlistment package,

20:23.560 --> 20:25.127
plus a promotion,

20:25.195 --> 20:28.430
that could pull his family
out of the shitter.

20:30.333 --> 20:33.669
Give your friend
the correct advice, Captain.

20:33.736 --> 20:35.104
Make it happen.

20:52.690 --> 20:56.426
Where does Mom
keep the pancake mix?

20:56.493 --> 20:57.594
The what...?

20:57.661 --> 20:58.995
You're toast, asswipe.

20:59.063 --> 21:00.296
Found it.

21:03.900 --> 21:05.568
Hey, Dad...

21:08.672 --> 21:10.572
What's it like to kill somebody?

21:36.734 --> 21:38.634
Can I help you?

21:38.702 --> 21:42.005
Yeah, just a couple
questions, Sergeant Brody.

21:42.073 --> 21:43.640
Nick. Can I call you Nick?

21:43.708 --> 21:45.508
You got ten seconds
to get off my property.

21:45.576 --> 21:47.711
I'm Alan Quick, channel 10,

21:47.778 --> 21:50.046
and technically, I'm standing
on a public easement.

21:50.114 --> 21:51.081
Five seconds.

21:51.148 --> 21:52.582
Oh, come on, Nick.

21:52.650 --> 21:54.851
Hey, how about we start
with an easy one?

21:54.918 --> 21:57.520
Tell me, how are your kids
doing with all of the--

22:34.293 --> 22:36.228
Fuck.

22:36.295 --> 22:38.430
Fuck!

22:38.498 --> 22:40.265
Max, he's heading
through the woods out back.

22:40.333 --> 22:41.767
Uh, less than a minute ago.

22:41.835 --> 22:43.769
I need you to hurry round
to Mansfield Road.

22:43.836 --> 22:45.136
It's about 400 yards north.

22:45.204 --> 22:46.905
Okay. Call me back
when you find him.

22:48.807 --> 22:50.708
Shit.

22:53.678 --> 22:56.146
Who left this pan on the stove?

23:00.217 --> 23:02.151
Chris!

23:02.219 --> 23:04.153
Where's Dad?

23:33.818 --> 23:37.320
♪ ♪

24:03.512 --> 24:05.947
You know, the whole
reason I left the Company

24:06.015 --> 24:08.115
and went freelance was
so I could have a life.

24:08.183 --> 24:10.351
You're becoming my wife's
least favorite person.

24:10.419 --> 24:11.952
I've got incoming HUMINT
I got to go deal with.

24:12.020 --> 24:12.953
Who is it?

24:13.021 --> 24:13.987
Someone I recruited

24:14.055 --> 24:15.989
in Bahrain a few years ago.

24:16.057 --> 24:17.124
Professional girlfriend
of a Saudi prince.

24:17.191 --> 24:18.458
What's she got?

24:18.526 --> 24:20.293
We'll find out soon enough.

24:21.863 --> 24:23.530
You got anything to eat?

24:23.598 --> 24:25.465
Um... yeah.

24:25.533 --> 24:27.100
There's a yogurt in the fridge.

24:42.248 --> 24:43.481
Lynne, how are you?

24:43.549 --> 24:45.817
Okay, fine, I guess.

24:45.885 --> 24:47.319
W-What are you doing
here in D.C.?

24:47.387 --> 24:49.221
Prescreening more girls
for the prince's harem.

24:49.289 --> 24:50.656
He gets in tomorrow.

24:50.724 --> 24:52.391
12:00 noon appointment.

24:52.459 --> 24:54.227
What's the code red?

24:54.295 --> 24:58.399
So, there I am,
five days ago, in Cypress

24:58.466 --> 25:00.401
on Prince Farid Bin Abbud's
yacht...

25:02.671 --> 25:05.539
when the Prince's Majordomo,
Latif Bin Walid,

25:05.607 --> 25:09.376
<i>announces that the prince</i>
<i>has a surprise visitor.</i>

25:09.444 --> 25:12.379
So, this surprise visitor,
who was he?

25:12.446 --> 25:15.748
You know that they stone
women like me to death

25:15.816 --> 25:18.751
<i>if we get caught doing anything</i>
<i>that we're not supposed to?</i>

25:35.334 --> 25:37.269
Abu Nazir.

25:37.336 --> 25:39.237
I was this far from him.

25:41.707 --> 25:45.309
I really don't want to do this
anymore, and I mean it, Carrie.

25:45.377 --> 25:47.945
I feel like I can't
even breathe now.

25:48.012 --> 25:49.980
They're gonna
suspect something.

25:50.048 --> 25:53.650
Lynne, all you have to do now
is keep your eyes and ears open

25:53.718 --> 25:55.886
for the remainder of
your contract with the prince.

25:55.953 --> 25:57.887
That's what you said when
you recruited me in Bahrain,

25:57.955 --> 25:59.756
but I never thought that
I would get eight feet

25:59.824 --> 26:01.224
from the most dangerous
terrorist in the world.

26:01.292 --> 26:02.992
You are the only agency asset

26:03.060 --> 26:05.328
to have had eyes on Nazir
in seven years.

26:05.396 --> 26:06.663
Asset?

26:06.730 --> 26:08.731
I am just some girl
from Sandusky, Ohio,

26:08.799 --> 26:10.900
who you talked into
helping out her country.

26:10.968 --> 26:12.869
And I won't let
anything happen to you.

26:14.972 --> 26:17.273
Don't quit on me now, please.
You can't.

26:17.341 --> 26:20.310
Don't think I don't
appreciate what it took

26:20.378 --> 26:21.878
for you to do this, Lynne.

26:27.351 --> 26:28.985
Saul Berenson.

26:29.053 --> 26:30.186
Alert the group, Saul.

26:30.254 --> 26:31.287
Inform Estes.

26:31.355 --> 26:32.755
This is a game-changer.

26:32.823 --> 26:34.090
Can't be more specific?

26:34.157 --> 26:35.958
I don't want to talk
on an open line.

26:36.026 --> 26:37.326
Source protection?

26:37.394 --> 26:40.963
It's way past
source protection, Saul.

26:41.030 --> 26:43.432
I've got a visual confirm
on the Sandman.

26:43.499 --> 26:45.133
- What?
- You heard me.

26:45.201 --> 26:47.369
Actual eyes on.

26:47.437 --> 26:48.937
How far away are you?

26:49.005 --> 26:50.205
20 minutes.

26:50.273 --> 26:52.174
I'll assemble the group.

27:06.523 --> 27:08.023
What are you doing here?

27:08.091 --> 27:09.324
Have to talk to Brody.

27:09.392 --> 27:10.492
Hey, bud.

27:10.560 --> 27:12.328
What's up?

27:12.396 --> 27:13.729
My dad beat the crap
out of somebody.

27:13.797 --> 27:15.030
Dana, I asked you to please

27:15.098 --> 27:16.532
watch TV with Chris for a while.

27:16.599 --> 27:17.699
She went to her room.

27:17.767 --> 27:19.234
Beat the crap out of who?

27:19.302 --> 27:20.835
Can you please go watch TV
for a little while?

27:20.903 --> 27:22.170
I need to talk to Uncle Mike.

27:22.238 --> 27:24.072
Can you do that for me?

27:24.140 --> 27:25.573
Yeah.
Okay.

27:25.641 --> 27:27.241
Come in.

27:32.614 --> 27:33.681
What's going on?

27:33.748 --> 27:35.415
Why aren't the kids at school?

27:35.483 --> 27:36.750
You don't know? Isn't
that why you're here?

27:36.818 --> 27:37.851
No. What?

27:37.919 --> 27:39.653
Are you okay?

27:39.720 --> 27:42.322
Brody hit a reporter and then
he took off into the woods.

27:42.390 --> 27:43.524
Chris saw the whole thing.

27:43.591 --> 27:46.094
Take a breath, Jess.
Come here.

27:46.161 --> 27:48.196
Well, hello, Mrs. Brody.

27:48.264 --> 27:50.199
When was this?

27:50.266 --> 27:51.900
About an hour ago, maybe more.

27:51.968 --> 27:54.904
Why didn't you call me
right away, Jess?

27:54.972 --> 27:56.373
What the hell is that?

27:56.441 --> 27:57.941
He has nightmares.

27:58.009 --> 28:00.577
Brody did that?

28:00.645 --> 28:02.412
Or flashbacks,
whatever you call them.

28:02.480 --> 28:06.283
I have to make it work
with Brody. I have to.

28:06.351 --> 28:09.553
This is where he tells you
everything's gonna be okay.

28:09.621 --> 28:11.422
It's gonna be okay, Jess.

28:11.490 --> 28:13.891
Is it really?

28:13.959 --> 28:15.392
Do you honestly think so?

28:15.460 --> 28:18.395
Ugh.

28:18.463 --> 28:20.097
That's disgusting, Carrie.

28:23.033 --> 28:24.468
This is the first
confirmed sighting

28:24.535 --> 28:25.736
of Abu Nazir in seven years.

28:25.804 --> 28:27.038
And very much to your credit.

28:27.105 --> 28:28.473
Nobody's arguing with that.

28:28.540 --> 28:30.309
But it's not enough
to authorize a task force.

28:30.376 --> 28:31.910
I'm not asking for that.

28:31.978 --> 28:34.280
All I need is a few more bodies
on Sergeant Brody.

28:34.348 --> 28:36.783
Look, the circle's small.

28:36.851 --> 28:39.086
We keep it that way
till you have more than

28:39.153 --> 28:41.288
just a theory
linking Brody and Abu Nazir.

28:41.356 --> 28:43.324
So Abu Nazir's
resurfacing just as

28:43.392 --> 28:45.293
Brody has miraculously
returned home means nothing?

28:45.360 --> 28:47.128
It's just a coincidence?

28:47.196 --> 28:50.331
The dots are there, Carrie, but
you haven't connected them yet.

28:50.399 --> 28:52.967
Saul, I understand that
you're still furious with me,

28:53.035 --> 28:55.103
but give me
something here, please.

28:56.338 --> 28:57.772
I'm not telling you to stop.

28:57.840 --> 28:59.274
I'm telling you to slow down.

28:59.341 --> 29:01.810
The FISA warrant--

29:01.878 --> 29:03.812
that gives you four weeks.

29:03.880 --> 29:05.514
Use it.

29:05.581 --> 29:08.450
Carefully, methodically.

29:08.518 --> 29:11.320
Look, like it or not, you work
for Deputy Director David Estes,

29:11.388 --> 29:13.589
who has career stakes in Brody,

29:13.657 --> 29:17.527
whom he and his department
brought home to great fanfare.

29:17.595 --> 29:20.163
Want to challenge that,

29:20.231 --> 29:23.366
better be damn sure you get
all your ducks in a row first.

29:30.173 --> 29:31.707
Where is he now?

29:31.774 --> 29:33.008
I don't know.

29:33.076 --> 29:34.943
What do you mean you don't know?

29:35.011 --> 29:36.177
He can't have gone far.

29:36.245 --> 29:37.812
Listen to me, if Brody has

29:37.880 --> 29:40.315
one 15-second meeting
with one contact,

29:40.382 --> 29:41.516
that's all it'll take.

29:41.583 --> 29:42.950
I'm not gonna miss that.

29:43.018 --> 29:45.019
Find him and find him fast.

29:45.087 --> 29:46.121
Call me back.

29:46.188 --> 29:47.656
Last 14 days of

29:47.723 --> 29:49.324
air traffic data
from all airports--

29:49.392 --> 29:50.392
commercial, cargo.

29:50.460 --> 29:53.196
And the banks.

29:53.264 --> 29:56.734
All new patterns and numerical
transactions of any amounts.

29:56.801 --> 29:58.836
Please. Thank you.

29:58.904 --> 30:01.005
Let me be the first to say,
Carrie, outstanding work.

30:01.073 --> 30:03.674
All other files on your
desk go on the back burner,

30:03.742 --> 30:05.476
as of right now.

30:05.544 --> 30:08.012
I want your girl on this prince
Farid like white on rice.

30:08.080 --> 30:09.479
Mike.

30:09.547 --> 30:10.880
First thing you get her to do

30:10.948 --> 30:12.715
is upload the data
on his BlackBerry.

30:12.783 --> 30:13.983
She's scared out of her mind.

30:14.051 --> 30:15.352
Thank you.

30:15.419 --> 30:17.187
I need to be able
to guarantee her protection.

30:17.255 --> 30:18.321
Backup.

30:18.389 --> 30:20.056
Would a four-man
fire team do it?

30:21.158 --> 30:23.226
Great.

30:23.293 --> 30:26.763
For an escort you
recruited in Bahrain?

30:26.830 --> 30:28.698
Don't be a prick, David.

30:28.766 --> 30:30.700
You know damn well if we
put a Quick Reaction Team

30:30.768 --> 30:32.368
on the girl in this
short time frame,

30:32.436 --> 30:34.370
we have no idea of
knowing who's watching.

30:34.438 --> 30:36.706
If Abu Nazir even smells we're
onto the prince, he'll vanish.

30:36.773 --> 30:38.274
Into thin air, again.

30:38.341 --> 30:40.209
It's the QRT's job
not to be detected.

30:40.277 --> 30:41.845
You're saying
you can't trust those guys

30:41.912 --> 30:43.346
to protect an asset in danger?

30:43.414 --> 30:45.349
It's my job to make the
tough calls, Carrie.

30:45.416 --> 30:46.617
The answer is no.

30:46.684 --> 30:48.185
Your job is to
control your asset.

30:48.253 --> 30:49.820
She needs backup,
you're it. Get it done.

30:51.957 --> 30:54.692
Yes, sir.

30:59.766 --> 31:01.233
Will someone in Lighting

31:01.300 --> 31:03.301
please pick up line three?

31:03.369 --> 31:05.637
Lighting, line three, please?

31:17.382 --> 31:19.316
Please let this be good news.

31:19.384 --> 31:20.951
He's looking at everything.

31:21.019 --> 31:24.422
Lumber, nails, screws,

31:24.489 --> 31:25.790
electrical wiring,

31:25.857 --> 31:27.158
power tools, you name it.

31:27.226 --> 31:28.593
Is he taking notes or anything?

31:28.661 --> 31:30.896
Whatever he's doing, looks like

31:30.963 --> 31:32.197
he's doing it all in his head.

31:34.635 --> 31:36.002
Okay, he's on the move.

31:36.070 --> 31:37.938
I'll, uh, I'll call you back.

31:38.005 --> 31:39.306
What?

31:57.358 --> 31:59.026
I guess we might as well eat.

31:59.093 --> 32:01.128
Is Dad still AWOL?

32:01.195 --> 32:03.797
Oh, he'll be back,
don't you worry.

32:03.865 --> 32:05.799
Hey.
Hey.

32:05.867 --> 32:08.135
Any new developments?

32:08.202 --> 32:10.437
I'm telling you,
this guy's got to be wishing

32:10.505 --> 32:13.674
that Brody doesn't come back
so he can keep doing the wife.

32:13.742 --> 32:15.676
She thought
breaking up was easy.

32:18.447 --> 32:20.448
Any popcorn in there?

32:20.516 --> 32:25.286
Well, as a matter
of fact, we have...

32:25.353 --> 32:27.154
pretzels.

32:27.222 --> 32:30.023
I love-a da pretzels.

32:30.091 --> 32:32.826
Uncle Mike,
since you're a captain

32:32.893 --> 32:35.694
and Dad's only a sergeant, does
that make you the boss of him?

32:36.763 --> 32:38.196
Smells delicious.

32:38.264 --> 32:40.966
Don't sergeants have
to salute to the captain

32:41.033 --> 32:42.133
and call him sir?

32:44.270 --> 32:45.704
It's Irish stew!

32:45.772 --> 32:47.072
Dad's favorite.

32:47.140 --> 32:48.173
Right, Mom?

32:48.241 --> 32:50.909
Is Dad in trouble?

32:50.977 --> 32:52.978
Trouble? No, no.

32:53.046 --> 32:56.048
Like I told you earlier, bud,

32:56.115 --> 32:57.416
that reporter out there,
he's the one

32:57.483 --> 32:58.783
who should be in trouble,
all right?

33:03.589 --> 33:06.324
Wait, there's no
camera in the garage?

33:06.392 --> 33:09.193
Uh, you know, on this budget,
I had to prioritize.

33:09.261 --> 33:10.828
And now he's placing a bag

33:10.896 --> 33:12.997
containing God knows
what in our blind spot?

33:13.064 --> 33:14.765
Jesus Christ, Virgil!

33:19.470 --> 33:21.438
Guys think about playing

33:21.505 --> 33:22.906
a couple rounds of cards?

33:22.974 --> 33:24.074
Yeah.
Huh?

33:32.785 --> 33:35.020
Where's the sound?

33:35.088 --> 33:37.089
Not that you deserve it, but...

33:39.760 --> 33:40.927
Thank you.

33:40.994 --> 33:42.729
Where have you been?
Sorry.

33:42.797 --> 33:43.930
I was out walking.

33:43.998 --> 33:45.398
All day?

33:45.466 --> 33:47.301
Didn't know that
wasn't allowed.

33:47.368 --> 33:49.336
Please don't do that.

33:54.041 --> 33:56.142
You know, the past eight years
haven't exactly been

33:56.210 --> 33:57.977
a picnic for me
and the kids, either.

34:00.448 --> 34:03.149
One way or another,
we've all changed.

34:03.217 --> 34:05.285
We just have to find
a way to start over.

34:11.494 --> 34:12.661
You punched a reporter.

34:12.728 --> 34:13.661
Oh, he'll live.

34:13.728 --> 34:14.763
In front of Chris.

34:14.831 --> 34:16.465
He'll live, too.

34:18.635 --> 34:20.402
That's it?

34:20.471 --> 34:21.404
"He'll live?"

34:21.471 --> 34:23.072
Dinner smells good.

34:31.047 --> 34:32.181
Go on.
I lost.

34:32.248 --> 34:33.616
There's no hand.

34:33.684 --> 34:35.184
Oh.
Hey, guys.

34:37.221 --> 34:38.420
What are you playing?

34:38.487 --> 34:40.188
Hearts.

34:40.257 --> 34:42.591
Hearts? Watch out
for this guy, kids.

34:42.659 --> 34:44.293
Back in the day, he used to

34:44.360 --> 34:45.661
double his paycheck
playing this game.

34:47.563 --> 34:49.498
Hearts, which the Marines
call "Hunt the Cunt."

34:49.567 --> 34:51.367
Dana!

34:51.435 --> 34:53.136
Maybe the daughter
is the terrorist.

34:53.204 --> 34:54.504
Don't blame me, Mom,
blame the Marines.

34:54.572 --> 34:55.839
Fuck you, Virgil.

34:55.906 --> 34:59.142
Right, and good night
to you, too.

34:59.210 --> 35:01.111
Mom's Irish stew?

35:03.347 --> 35:04.648
Should we say grace?

35:06.784 --> 35:08.218
We say grace now?

35:09.454 --> 35:11.455
When we have things

35:11.523 --> 35:13.324
we're especially thankful
for, right, guys?

35:13.392 --> 35:14.658
Can I do it, please?

35:14.726 --> 35:16.794
Go ahead, sweetie.

35:16.862 --> 35:20.397
Dear God, thank you for
bringing my dad back.

35:20.465 --> 35:21.999
Please make him a captain, too,

35:22.067 --> 35:23.701
just like Mike.

35:27.305 --> 35:29.573
What about the food, Chris?

35:29.641 --> 35:32.543
Oh, yeah, and, uh,
thanks for the food.

35:32.610 --> 35:33.810
Amen.

35:33.878 --> 35:35.312
Amen.

35:43.955 --> 35:45.555
No.
You sure?

35:46.657 --> 35:49.425
Cuban.

35:49.493 --> 35:51.760
You always come over
here in uniform?

35:53.830 --> 35:55.764
"Once a Marine,
always a Marine."

35:55.832 --> 35:58.066
Does it start
something like that?

35:58.134 --> 36:01.402
Look, I'm not gonna
bullshit you.

36:01.470 --> 36:03.037
You can't keep
doing this, Brody.

36:03.105 --> 36:04.538
Doing what?

36:04.606 --> 36:07.008
Come on, you know
it's a fuckin' win-win.

36:07.076 --> 36:08.109
You talk to the press.

36:08.177 --> 36:10.245
You take that call
from CBS News, I mean,

36:10.312 --> 36:11.279
do an interview--

36:11.347 --> 36:12.546
Whoa, whoa, stop
right there, Mike.

36:12.614 --> 36:14.014
There gonna
give you a promotion.

36:14.082 --> 36:15.950
I mean, Hollywood's gonna do
a fuckin' movie about you.

36:16.018 --> 36:17.218
In the process,
you get to provide

36:17.286 --> 36:18.953
for Jess and the kids.

36:19.021 --> 36:20.622
I said stop!

36:20.689 --> 36:22.190
The brass sent you over here

36:22.258 --> 36:24.459
to turn me into some
fuckin' poster boy

36:24.527 --> 36:26.228
for their bullshit war.

36:28.298 --> 36:30.299
You know what?

36:30.366 --> 36:32.768
You can go right back there
and tell 'em the days

36:32.836 --> 36:34.937
that I take orders from
the United State military

36:35.005 --> 36:36.873
or the government, are over.

36:36.940 --> 36:38.508
Done.

36:43.114 --> 36:46.550
You know what I
really need, Mike?

36:46.617 --> 36:48.618
I need the last
eight years back...

36:50.955 --> 36:54.757
where I get to take care
of my wife and kids...

36:54.825 --> 36:56.792
where I don't get asked
to go over there

36:56.860 --> 37:00.729
and fight their fucking war...

37:00.797 --> 37:02.564
or I'm not taken prisoner.

37:02.632 --> 37:04.566
Not left out there to rot.

37:04.634 --> 37:06.635
Never tortured--
none of it.

37:09.005 --> 37:10.807
Can you do that for me?

37:10.874 --> 37:13.142
Or is it too much to ask?

37:13.211 --> 37:16.747
There's the door.

37:16.815 --> 37:18.616
Uncle Mike.

37:42.074 --> 37:45.443
There are times when you have
to stand up for yourself...

37:45.511 --> 37:47.178
and what you believe in.

37:49.748 --> 37:51.816
I wish you hadn't seen
what you saw today,

37:51.884 --> 37:55.520
but you did, and I'm sorry.

37:57.890 --> 37:59.891
You gonna be okay?

38:29.322 --> 38:30.355
That's what happens sometimes

38:30.423 --> 38:31.389
when you have some success

38:31.457 --> 38:33.992
against a great
offensive player.

38:41.600 --> 38:43.434
Gets the ball,
puts up another three...

38:44.637 --> 38:45.904
He's gone!

38:45.971 --> 38:47.171
I'll tell you, they are having
an amazing season.

38:47.239 --> 38:48.673
Back up by eight now.

38:48.740 --> 38:49.941
Roberts has got
half the points.

38:50.008 --> 38:53.277
He's got 15 of the 32.
He just keeps missing...

38:53.345 --> 38:55.947
Everyone just wants
to thank you for your service.

38:57.950 --> 38:59.484
Your sacrifice.

39:03.990 --> 39:08.293
Maybe they want to thank all
of us-- you, me and the kids.

39:15.835 --> 39:19.204
Fine.

39:19.272 --> 39:21.873
One day, you're gonna want
to talk about all this.

39:25.778 --> 39:28.780
Broadcast continues,
indistinctly)

39:29.782 --> 39:33.517
♪ ♪

39:39.992 --> 39:42.127
Take His Highness upstairs
to settle him in.

39:42.194 --> 39:43.161
How long until his
next appointment?

39:43.229 --> 39:44.630
Long enough.

39:44.698 --> 39:46.432
Uh, yeah.
No, I read the article

39:46.500 --> 39:47.834
in the <i>Journal--</i>
it's fantastic.

39:47.901 --> 39:49.135
No, I'll call you
soon, we can--

39:49.203 --> 39:51.338
Oh! Wow! I...

39:51.405 --> 39:52.472
Are you fucking kidding me?

39:52.540 --> 39:53.607
I am so sorry.
That was an accident.

39:53.674 --> 39:54.641
Don't worry, sir.
Accidents happen.

39:54.709 --> 39:56.243
Here, let me get that.
No need. Please.

39:56.311 --> 39:58.178
May I at least
pay for the dry cleaning?

39:58.246 --> 39:59.580
Thank you. No need.

39:59.647 --> 40:00.681
Go wash it off.

40:00.748 --> 40:01.982
You have less
than three minutes.

40:02.050 --> 40:03.817
I'll wait here.

40:03.885 --> 40:05.252
You're not gonna
believe what happened.

40:05.320 --> 40:07.488
I-I spilled tea on this
girl's blouse and it's...

40:15.496 --> 40:17.030
Jesus!

40:17.097 --> 40:18.798
Under the sponge
of this compact,

40:18.866 --> 40:20.200
there's a plug-in device

40:20.267 --> 40:22.168
that'll fit into
the prince's Blackberry.

40:22.235 --> 40:25.772
It'll need 45 seconds
to upload all his data.

40:27.708 --> 40:29.142
And let's suppose that
I get that far...?

40:29.209 --> 40:32.445
You call the spa again and you
hand it off to me in person.

40:32.513 --> 40:33.813
What if the device doesn't fit?

40:33.881 --> 40:36.115
It will.

40:36.183 --> 40:38.785
You said before that you would
never let anything happen to me.

40:38.852 --> 40:40.619
And I meant it.

40:42.689 --> 40:45.791
There's a team
protecting you 24/7.

40:45.859 --> 40:47.359
Where are they?

40:47.427 --> 40:49.494
Aside from the man who
spilled tea on you just now,

40:49.562 --> 40:51.630
who you won't see again,
they're right under your nose.

40:51.697 --> 40:54.132
But if you can see them,
or know who they are,

40:54.200 --> 40:55.367
that's a problem.

40:58.204 --> 40:59.504
I need your compact.

41:27.966 --> 41:30.268
♪ ♪

41:55.424 --> 41:57.859
Auntie Carrie!

41:57.927 --> 41:58.927
Hi!

41:59.962 --> 42:02.397
Aw... Oh! Wow!

42:02.464 --> 42:05.100
That is the best welcome
I've ever had from anyone.

42:05.167 --> 42:06.535
How are you two?

42:06.603 --> 42:07.803
You forgot
Ruby's birthday, silly.

42:07.870 --> 42:09.971
It was really awesome.

42:10.039 --> 42:11.873
This man brought
snakes and lizards

42:11.941 --> 42:13.041
and turtles and everything.

42:13.109 --> 42:14.242
A snake ate a rat.

42:14.310 --> 42:15.610
Ugh!

42:15.678 --> 42:19.314
I missed that? Damn!

42:19.381 --> 42:20.782
I forgot your birthday.

42:20.849 --> 42:22.116
I'm sorry, Ruby.

42:22.184 --> 42:23.384
Oh, but there...

42:23.452 --> 42:25.886
is this.

42:27.656 --> 42:29.223
I told you, Ruby.

42:29.291 --> 42:32.660
You thought I'd forget something
as important as that?

42:32.728 --> 42:34.429
I was working
last Saturday, honey.

42:34.497 --> 42:35.664
If I could've come, I would've.

42:35.732 --> 42:38.000
I promise.

42:38.068 --> 42:41.270
Mom! Mom! Look what Aunt Carrie
got Ruby for her birthday!

42:41.338 --> 42:43.239
Wow, that is so cool!

42:43.306 --> 42:44.273
Did you say thank you?

42:44.341 --> 42:45.274
Thank you.

42:45.342 --> 42:46.609
You're welcome, honey.

42:46.676 --> 42:47.776
Okay, now, you two monkeys.

42:47.844 --> 42:49.011
Come on in
and finish your homework.

42:49.079 --> 42:50.213
You can see Aunt Carrie
when you're done.

42:54.751 --> 42:56.018
That's impressive!

42:56.086 --> 42:57.319
I beat them.

42:57.387 --> 42:58.587
Don't tell the neighbors.

42:58.654 --> 42:59.588
Come on in.

43:02.991 --> 43:04.325
Staying for dinner?

43:04.393 --> 43:06.294
I can't. I'd--

43:06.362 --> 43:08.930
--love to, but you're
slammed as usual.

43:08.998 --> 43:10.799
Maggie...
No, don't.

43:10.867 --> 43:12.668
You don't have to explain.

43:16.005 --> 43:17.840
We worry about you, Dad and I.

43:17.908 --> 43:19.675
Yeah.

43:19.743 --> 43:21.344
How's he doing?

43:21.411 --> 43:24.280
Considering he has the
same illness you have...

43:24.348 --> 43:26.949
Well, now he's under my roof,

43:27.017 --> 43:29.785
he goes for regular therapy and
treatment-- that's the deal.

43:29.853 --> 43:32.621
So, um... he's good.

43:33.723 --> 43:35.123
Are you finished?

43:36.192 --> 43:38.025
Come on, Maggie, ease up a bit.

43:38.093 --> 43:40.061
Just once, give me a break.

43:46.267 --> 43:47.901
Only seven this time?

43:47.969 --> 43:50.471
Raiding my samples cupboard
not only enables you,

43:50.538 --> 43:56.010
it jeopardizes my license,
so, uh... seven pills.

43:56.077 --> 43:58.913
And we talk again in
a week, not a month.

43:58.980 --> 44:00.581
Or you could just
deal with the problem

44:00.649 --> 44:02.650
like any normal person would
and go see a psychiatrist.

44:02.718 --> 44:04.852
I keep telling you
to work where I work.

44:04.920 --> 44:06.053
You can't disclose your illness

44:06.121 --> 44:07.855
or they'll pull
your security clearance.

44:07.922 --> 44:09.323
I understand, Carrie.

44:09.391 --> 44:11.726
I'm really good
at what I do, Maggie.

44:11.793 --> 44:13.794
And I'm not just a quack.

44:17.232 --> 44:19.200
Dad'll be pissed he missed you.

44:19.268 --> 44:21.202
Where is he?

44:21.270 --> 44:24.071
Bill took the day off.
They went golfing.

44:26.074 --> 44:27.909
You said you were
coming tonight.

44:27.976 --> 44:29.444
It's not even 6:00 yet.

44:34.182 --> 44:35.950
Next time.

44:36.018 --> 44:36.984
Okay.

44:38.086 --> 44:39.454
I'll go say good-bye
to the girls.

44:49.098 --> 44:51.533

44:54.838 --> 44:56.071
