03:11.439 --> 03:12.749
My God.

03:14.069 --> 03:16.379
There's an awning on the new store.

03:17.079 --> 03:19.949
There's still soap on all the windows.

03:21.719 --> 03:22.699
So?

03:25.049 --> 03:26.929
They're hiding something.

03:28.659 --> 03:30.549
I don't think so, Nettie.

03:30.999 --> 03:35.223
I think it's just going to be
some kind of antique store is all.

03:35.509 --> 03:38.029
I'm never going over there.

03:43.669 --> 03:46.939
Hey, Raider. How are you, buddy?
Good to see you.

03:48.989 --> 03:51.159
–Hi, Nettie.
–Hi.

03:51.669 --> 03:54.869
–Is Polly around?
–Gosh, yes. It's lunchtime.

04:03.899 --> 04:04.879
Hi.

04:07.449 --> 04:09.589
–Morning, Frank, Father Meehan.
–Hi, Alan.

04:09.629 --> 04:10.639
Good afternoon.

04:11.389 --> 04:13.489
–Smoked turkey on rye?
–Not today.

04:13.529 --> 04:15.739
Think I'll try one of your specials today.

04:15.779 --> 04:18.869
So I'll have… What's that? I'll have that.
Delicious salami…

04:18.909 --> 04:22.939
provolone, lettuce, tomato, mayo,
and two kinds of mustard in a pita pocket.

04:22.979 --> 04:24.019
I wouldn't.

04:24.289 --> 04:27.519
Okay, how about smoked turkey on rye?

04:27.809 --> 04:28.789
Good order.

04:29.439 --> 04:33.399
–Smoked turkey, rye!
–And a big piece of Nettie's apple pie.

04:36.099 --> 04:37.989
So how's your day so far?

04:39.229 --> 04:42.749
A little crazy, actually.
Did I tell you I got the photos back…

04:42.789 --> 04:44.889
“You won't believe your eyes.

04:45.379 --> 04:46.909
”Needful things.

04:47.299 --> 04:49.019
”A new kind of store.

04:49.279 --> 04:51.389
You won't believe your eyes.”

04:52.009 --> 04:53.569
It says so right there.

04:54.369 --> 04:56.379
Then it must be true.

04:56.869 --> 04:58.453
So, who's the new owner?

04:58.469 --> 05:01.241
Nobody knows.
Not from around here is all.

05:32.839 --> 05:35.229
Aren't you supposed to be in school?

05:35.689 --> 05:36.999
Got a cold.

06:39.099 --> 06:40.209
Hello?

07:24.669 --> 07:26.649
–Is anyone here?
–I'm here.

07:28.959 --> 07:31.959
The door was unlocked. I didn't bust in.

07:33.989 --> 07:36.699
Of course it's unlocked. I'm open.

07:38.339 --> 07:40.229
You've been here before.

07:45.129 --> 07:47.839
–No.
–Sure you have.

07:48.289 --> 07:50.299
I never forget a face.

07:51.939 --> 07:53.279
Who are you?

07:54.279 --> 07:57.659
My name is Leland Gaunt. And you are?

07:58.629 --> 08:00.389
Brian Rusk.

08:01.029 --> 08:02.481
Nice meeting you, sir.

08:02.789 --> 08:06.749
I'm equally pleased
to make your acquaintance, Master Brian.

08:06.889 --> 08:08.799
Now, what would you fancy?

08:08.969 --> 08:11.169
–Fancy?
–What would you like?

08:11.239 --> 08:15.359
Everything that's here is for sale,
but not everything that's for sale is here.

08:15.399 --> 08:17.181
I have a basement, you see.

08:17.679 --> 08:20.059
Are you from overseas somewhere?

08:20.969 --> 08:22.429
I'm from Akron.

08:23.559 --> 08:26.759
–Where's that? England?
–That's in Ohio.

08:28.269 --> 08:29.989
What do you know?

08:30.289 --> 08:33.061
There's Wilma Jerzyk
and her husband Pete.

08:33.708 --> 08:36.009
What do you suppose they're up to?

08:37.068 --> 08:39.339
Buying feed for their turkey farm?

08:40.208 --> 08:41.799
Roast turkey?

08:42.479 --> 08:44.869
No, she's a crazy person.

08:46.899 --> 08:49.129
Now, what'll it be? A Walkman!

08:49.489 --> 08:52.359
–A mountain bike.
–I already got one.

08:53.169 --> 08:56.199
–Air Jordans.
–I don't know.

08:56.309 --> 08:58.699
–Sure, yeah, I guess.
–Of course not.

08:58.739 --> 09:03.559
Those are just objects, aren't they?
Just things. Nothing really important.

09:03.599 --> 09:06.189
Suppose you had one wish, Brian.

09:06.839 --> 09:08.489
What would you say?

09:08.919 --> 09:12.229
–A wish?
–One wish. Just one. To make you happy.

09:12.789 --> 09:17.009
What would make you happy again?
Let's see, where do we start?

09:17.809 --> 09:21.505
–What could I possibly have around here…
–Mickey Mantle?

09:21.619 --> 09:25.489
–Little before your time, wasn't he?
–Yeah. I meant the baseball card.

09:25.529 --> 09:28.209
I mean, me and my dad,
we used to collect them.

09:28.249 --> 09:29.739
Topps or Fleers?

09:29.979 --> 09:33.329
Topps. We had a whole collection
of 56 baseball cards.

09:33.369 --> 09:36.399
Al Kaline, Whitey Ford, Roy Campanella,
guys of that caliber?

09:36.439 --> 09:39.211
We have every Yankee
except Mickey Mantle.

09:39.549 --> 09:42.899
I mean, Moose Skowron was over $65.

09:44.469 --> 09:46.519
Skowron is one thing.

09:47.289 --> 09:51.249
Mickey Mantle.
That's got to run $600, $700.

09:53.249 --> 09:54.259
You asked me.

09:54.909 --> 09:58.169
I believe I might have something
that'll make you very happy, Brian.

09:58.209 --> 09:59.729
Stay right here.

10:03.549 --> 10:05.559
My God. Look at my butt.

10:09.089 --> 10:11.597
–I look awful.
–No, you look fabulous.

10:11.839 --> 10:13.749
Pol, you know how…

10:14.299 --> 10:17.689
you're always saying
that I'm not all that serious about us?

10:17.729 --> 10:20.759
This is your camera, right?
I don't look like this.

10:20.799 --> 10:24.231
–I'll commit suicide if I look like this.
–Polly, I…

10:25.029 --> 10:26.139
Will you marry me?

10:26.179 --> 10:29.049
Sure, whenever you're serious about it.
I gotta check Nettie.

10:29.089 --> 10:32.919
Make sure she doesn't burn the French
fries again and put me in the poor house.

10:32.959 --> 10:33.979
Polly…

10:35.299 --> 10:36.709
I am serious.

10:40.679 --> 10:41.949
Mickey Mantle!

10:43.809 --> 10:46.179
“Topps, 1956.”

10:46.469 --> 10:49.789
Signed, “To my good friend Brian.”

10:50.539 --> 10:53.019
Wait a minute. Brian is my name.
That's impossible.

10:53.059 --> 10:55.939
“Best wishes, Mickey Mantle.”
Now, close your eyes, Brian.

10:55.979 --> 10:57.499
Close your eyes.

11:12.589 --> 11:16.739
Now, then. How much would you pay
for this card, Brian?

11:20.809 --> 11:23.879
Mickey Mantle. Topps, 1956.

11:24.399 --> 11:27.249
Signed, “To my good friend Brian.”

11:31.209 --> 11:34.029
No, listen, all I got here…

11:34.899 --> 11:37.449
The buyer must never tell
the seller how much he has.

11:37.489 --> 11:40.063
If you can't tell a lie, then be still.

11:40.399 --> 11:43.237
The first rule of fair trade, Master Brian.

11:44.589 --> 11:48.169
–So what do you think?
–I can't breathe yet.

11:49.039 --> 11:52.405
It's not as great as it looks.
I got it off the TV.

11:52.719 --> 11:54.059
Such a liar.

11:54.929 --> 11:57.419
–Put it on?
–Yeah.

12:12.689 --> 12:14.349
Does that mean yes?

12:18.709 --> 12:20.749
–Yeah. Yeah?
–Yes.

12:31.769 --> 12:32.749
No.

12:37.979 --> 12:40.789
95 cents!

12:42.809 --> 12:45.109
Now we're getting somewhere.

12:46.429 --> 12:50.899
Not quite enough, okay?
But an intriguing offer nonetheless.

12:51.579 --> 12:53.109
Let's call it…

12:53.629 --> 12:55.639
half the price, shall we?

12:55.809 --> 12:59.039
Yes. Half the price is 95 cents.

12:59.969 --> 13:01.789
The price you paid cash.

13:02.879 --> 13:04.189
The rest…

13:04.899 --> 13:09.169
the other half is a deed.
You understand?

13:10.789 --> 13:14.879
–A deed?
–A trick. More like a tiny prank.

13:14.949 --> 13:18.939
No big deal.
And no one's ever going to suspect you.

13:19.229 --> 13:20.279
I promise.

13:21.249 --> 13:25.889
Do you remember that lady we peeked at
buying feed across the street?

13:26.309 --> 13:29.659
Yeah, Wilma Jerzyk. The turkey farmer.

13:30.369 --> 13:32.259
You know where she lives?

14:28.079 --> 14:29.449
Out of the car.

14:30.099 --> 14:32.039
I said, “Get out of the car.”

14:35.699 --> 14:36.939
Now.

14:38.829 --> 14:43.109
Is this your name on this goddamn ticket,
Ridgewick, or is it a forgery?

14:43.149 --> 14:45.289
–You're parked in the crip space.
–The what?

14:45.329 --> 14:47.279
–You can't come in here…
–The what?

14:47.319 --> 14:50.439
The handicapped space.
We've told you about it before, Buster…

14:50.479 --> 14:53.099
What did you call me?
Did you call me Buster?

14:53.139 --> 14:55.879
Touch me again, I'll throw you in the cell!
I mean it!

14:55.919 --> 14:59.089
It's Danforth! Danforth Keeton ll…

14:59.159 --> 15:01.899
who is Head Selectman
of this piss pot little town.

15:01.939 --> 15:05.869
I could get you fired off the force in two…
Make that one second flat.

15:05.909 --> 15:09.579
–Am I getting through to you, Norris?
–I told him to write the ticket.

15:09.619 --> 15:11.629
In that case, my mistake.

15:11.699 --> 15:14.319
Jesus, Dan,
what in hell's got into you today?

15:14.359 --> 15:18.129
Nothing got into me! I'm just sick
and tired of self-important little pricks.

15:18.169 --> 15:20.369
–Pusillanimous assholes…
–That's enough!

15:20.409 --> 15:23.759
I try to do a lot for this town.
I accomplish a lot for this town.

15:23.799 --> 15:27.729
In fact, I am this town. And I am sick
and tired of this goddamn persecution.

15:27.769 --> 15:30.769
–I am not persecuting you, Danforth.
–He called me Buster!

15:30.809 --> 15:34.439
–You know how I feel about that.
–Then he'll apologize.

15:34.489 --> 15:35.769
Won't you, Norris?

15:36.119 --> 15:38.429
–Don't know that I will.
–You will.

15:38.559 --> 15:39.569
Now.

15:43.039 --> 15:44.079
I'm sorry.

15:45.019 --> 15:48.919
–I'm sorry that I called you Buster.
–Yeah, you mama's boy. You candy-assed…

15:48.959 --> 15:52.369
Shut up, you bloated,
cigar-sucking used car salesman.

15:52.409 --> 15:54.169
Boats, shithead!

15:54.489 --> 15:57.879
I sell quality preowned yachts,
you miserable fucking scuzz bucket…

15:57.919 --> 16:00.569
Shut up! Shut up!

16:01.409 --> 16:04.919
When I moved here, I thought,
“Great, I'm out of the big city.”

16:04.959 --> 16:08.759
I'm in a place where people won't be
crawling up each other's asshole every day.

16:08.799 --> 16:12.309
Where maybe my biggest nightmare
was gonna be getting a cat out of a tree.

16:12.349 --> 16:16.129
But forget that!
Everybody is insane everywhere!

16:16.449 --> 16:18.619
So you guys just fight it out between you.

16:18.659 --> 16:23.147
One of you kill each other,
and who's ever left, I'll throw in jail.

16:24.579 --> 16:27.945
You can do it. I know you can.
He's not gonna bite.

16:29.089 --> 16:32.739
But what will I say?

16:33.349 --> 16:36.349
You introduce yourself. “Hi. I'm Nettie.”

16:36.969 --> 16:38.239
Then what?

16:39.049 --> 16:41.249
Nettie, just go. You'll be fine.

16:43.529 --> 16:44.639
Go on.

16:48.299 --> 16:49.699
Hi. I'm Nettie.

16:59.019 --> 17:02.849
Thank you.

17:03.559 --> 17:06.469
It's only 19th century. I'm sorry.

17:07.689 --> 17:09.378
Enjoy your purchases.

17:14.029 --> 17:16.272
What's this? Some old wood chisel?

17:16.618 --> 17:19.429
It belonged to a cabinet maker
at Château de Versailles…

17:19.469 --> 17:21.118
in the days of Louis XVI.

17:24.269 --> 17:26.711
Look at this, Pete. Looks pretty old.

17:26.799 --> 17:28.108
Yep.

17:30.829 --> 17:35.019
My God. I didn't think we had room
for another soul in here.

17:35.189 --> 17:37.099
Hi. My name is Nettie.

17:41.139 --> 17:43.369
That stupid dog barks at me once more…

17:43.409 --> 17:46.159
I won't bother complaining
to Sheriff Pangborn again.

17:46.199 --> 17:51.413
–I'll come over your place, skin him alive.
–No, not in here. Dear God, please!

17:54.289 --> 17:56.969
–Throw her Baptist ass in the street.
–I will not.

17:57.009 --> 17:59.949
Dear ladies, let's all be friends.
Can't we all be friends?

17:59.989 --> 18:01.359
Not in this life.

18:02.649 --> 18:04.369
Please, not in my place.

18:04.569 --> 18:06.509
I'm sorry. Ladies, excuse me!

18:07.929 --> 18:09.269
Miss Jerzyk!

18:36.569 --> 18:38.579
Pick it up. Go ahead. Go on.

18:39.069 --> 18:41.009
Don't be afraid, Miss Cobb.

18:44.129 --> 18:48.799
No. I had one just like it years ago.
But it got broke.

18:50.049 --> 18:52.439
–My husband…
–Your husband?

18:52.669 --> 18:54.199
Then it's Mrs Cobb.

18:55.419 --> 18:59.059
Although my George has been passed on
for some time now.

18:59.099 --> 19:02.719
–He died, untimely.
–I'm so sorry to hear that.

19:04.289 --> 19:07.029
No need to be sorry.
It's been seven years since he was…

19:07.069 --> 19:08.899
Murder is awful.

19:10.599 --> 19:13.889
–I didn't mean to.
–Of course not.

19:14.339 --> 19:16.989
It wasn't you who took that meat fork
from the drawer…

19:17.029 --> 19:20.791
and stuck it in his throat.
Are you leaving, Mrs Roberts?

19:21.249 --> 19:24.669
I'll have to think about it.
It is a lot of money.

19:24.769 --> 19:26.749
You think about it. So will I.

19:34.309 --> 19:35.839
You baked this?

19:38.729 --> 19:39.909
Of course.

19:40.899 --> 19:44.991
Homemade every day from apples
picked down at the Mayflowers'.

19:45.229 --> 19:47.737
Polly Chalmers, my boss, sent it over.

19:52.199 --> 19:54.789
Go ahead. Take him.

19:58.029 --> 20:01.769
–I'm scared I'll drop it again.
–You won't drop it.

20:03.019 --> 20:04.549
Come, Mrs Cobb.

20:06.219 --> 20:07.779
Please, sit down.

20:14.319 --> 20:15.459
Listen.

20:17.069 --> 20:20.239
Sometimes I think I can hear
the tiniest laugh.

20:25.579 --> 20:27.279
I like you, Netitia.

20:29.749 --> 20:32.191
I won't yell at you, like George did.

20:35.149 --> 20:36.429
You moron!

20:38.799 --> 20:39.879
No!

20:54.769 --> 20:57.159
I think it should be yours, Netitia.

21:00.819 --> 21:02.929
I need to go to work.

21:04.979 --> 21:08.279
I'll see you soon. I'll drop by for a bite.

21:09.429 --> 21:12.663
Mr Keeton eats there most every day,
does he not?

21:13.749 --> 21:16.239
Yeah. Danforth Keeton.

21:17.369 --> 21:20.471
And everybody calls him Buster
behind his back.

21:21.109 --> 21:23.829
Why is that? Pray tell.

21:26.169 --> 21:27.699
I don't know.

21:28.479 --> 21:31.539
Maybe someone should play
a trick on Buster.

21:31.899 --> 21:33.619
Teach him to be nice.

21:36.249 --> 21:38.889
My husband played a lot of tricks on me.

21:38.939 --> 21:41.879
Maybe it would be fun
to play one on someone else.

21:41.919 --> 21:45.079
Nobody would ever know it was you,
I promise.

22:44.999 --> 22:46.715
Welcome to Needful Things.

22:49.389 --> 22:50.759
Alan Pangborn.

22:51.239 --> 22:54.803
–The sheriff around these parts.
–Leland Gaunt. Owner.

22:56.399 --> 22:58.973
–So, what can I sell you, Sheriff?
–Me?

22:59.849 --> 23:03.079
Nothing. I got everything I need, thanks.

23:05.069 --> 23:06.119
Fair enough.

23:07.409 --> 23:11.879
How about a piece of pie?
Your fiancée Ms Chalmers sent it over.

23:13.229 --> 23:15.499
–My fiancée?
–Such a pretty lady.

23:15.859 --> 23:18.959
You're a lucky man, Sheriff. I'll be back.

23:35.799 --> 23:40.049
Goodness.
I wish I had some cheddar cheese.

23:40.949 --> 23:44.269
But beggars can't be choosers, can they?

23:45.369 --> 23:48.809
Certain we haven't met somewhere before,
have we?

23:50.069 --> 23:51.629
What, you and me?

23:52.339 --> 23:53.769
In a big city.

23:55.029 --> 23:56.819
You look familiar, Al.

23:58.229 --> 24:00.671
You look out of place here, actually.

24:03.159 --> 24:06.289
You don't mind my saying so,
so do you, Leland.

24:09.109 --> 24:10.939
So, where are you from?

24:13.239 --> 24:14.289
Ohio.

24:15.129 --> 24:16.849
Akron, to be precise.

24:18.169 --> 24:19.479
Pittsburgh.

24:20.379 --> 24:22.069
I'm from Pittsburgh.

24:23.319 --> 24:25.109
So, why did you leave?

24:26.359 --> 24:30.619
I was a cop there,
and I got tired of all the shit going down.

24:32.289 --> 24:34.229
And one day I just lost it.

24:36.089 --> 24:37.559
I hit this guy.

24:40.509 --> 24:41.919
Way too hard.

24:43.229 --> 24:45.439
I reckon he needed some killing.

24:50.269 --> 24:53.919
But it was still wrong.

24:54.269 --> 24:55.699
Of course it was.

24:59.459 --> 25:01.759
Yeah. So I left, and now I'm here.

25:07.459 --> 25:08.639
So am I.

25:44.559 --> 25:46.409
–Reverend.
–Sheriff.

25:47.789 --> 25:50.919
–Alan, thanks for coming!
–Afternoon, Father.

25:51.279 --> 25:55.169
–Hi, Sheriff.
–I got this in the mail this morning.

25:56.169 --> 25:58.479
“Listen up, you mackerel snapper.”

26:00.619 --> 26:03.369
–Excuse me.
–“We've tried to reason with you…

26:03.409 --> 26:07.699
”…but it's been no use.
We have put up with your Popish idolatry…

26:07.729 --> 26:11.755
”…and even with your licentious worship
of the Babylon whore…

26:11.889 --> 26:13.869
…but now you've gone too far.”

26:13.999 --> 26:16.903
“Babylon whore.”
I mean, saints preserve us.

26:16.909 --> 26:20.909
“Heed our warning.
Give up your plan to turn this town…

26:20.979 --> 26:25.419
”…into a den of thieves and gamblers,
or you will smell the brimstone.

26:25.459 --> 26:29.289
” ‘The wicked shall be turned
into hell.’ Psalms 9:17.

26:29.459 --> 26:32.231
The concerned Baptist men
of Castle Rock.”

26:32.559 --> 26:34.479
It's that idiot, Reverend Willie Rose.

26:34.519 --> 26:36.969
Maybe you shouldn't have
called it “Casino Night.”

26:37.009 --> 26:40.399
For God's sake, Alan.
It's only a little charity gambling.

26:40.439 --> 26:42.929
I mean, I don't know why
it upsets the Baptists so.

26:42.969 --> 26:44.559
I'll go talk to Rever…

26:44.629 --> 26:47.249
When I was younger,
people got along better!

26:47.289 --> 26:50.539
I'll go talk to him.
I'll get to the bottom of it.

26:50.579 --> 26:52.369
You do that, Alan.

26:52.539 --> 26:56.629
And when you do,
you tell Rose that if he tries to bump us…

26:56.729 --> 27:01.085
he'll find out just how hard
we “mackerel snappers” can bump back!

27:02.909 --> 27:07.509
Pete, get me a gobbler from the pen!
I feel like turkey tonight.

27:08.249 --> 27:10.889
You feel like turkey every night, Wilma.

27:24.129 --> 27:25.209
Wilma!

27:29.689 --> 27:31.959
–What happened?
–Mud!

27:33.919 --> 27:36.639
Mud and shit! Goddamn turkey shit!

27:37.219 --> 27:39.133
Why'd someone go and do that?

27:39.779 --> 27:42.683
–Because I told her I'll kill it.
–Told who?

27:51.489 --> 27:52.699
Dot.

27:52.999 --> 27:56.259
–Yes, just a sec. It's for you.
–Me?

27:56.639 --> 28:00.159
Okay, it's the square key. All the doors.

28:00.229 --> 28:03.479
Don't forget the lights.
You can do it. You'll be fine.

28:03.519 --> 28:05.961
–I'll see you in the morning.
–Night.

28:08.419 --> 28:10.179
Hi. This is Nettie.

28:10.729 --> 28:13.509
I know what you done, you crazy bitch!

28:13.959 --> 28:14.939
Done what?

28:15.079 --> 28:18.529
Fucking with me
was the worst mistake you ever made.

28:18.699 --> 28:22.499
I'm going to get you for this,
you understand? You and your mutt!

28:22.539 --> 28:26.149
You don't dare!
You stop bothering me and my Raider!

28:27.369 --> 28:32.189
–He's a good doggie!
–You won't see me coming!

28:49.289 --> 28:52.787
Guy sounds like he's havin'
a fucking pepoleptic fit.

28:52.939 --> 28:53.889
Yep.

28:58.219 --> 29:00.329
Don't kick the Rock-Ola, Hugh.

29:01.039 --> 29:02.379
You hear me?

29:03.919 --> 29:07.879
How you doing at the tracks, Dan?
Horses finally running your way?

29:07.919 --> 29:11.149
Every time, Henry. Every goddamn time.

29:11.219 --> 29:15.377
I'm gonna kick that jukebox wide open,
you don't fix it, Henry.

29:16.529 --> 29:19.079
All right. That's it. You're out of here.

29:19.119 --> 29:20.459
Give me that back.

29:20.529 --> 29:24.399
Any of you fellas heading up
to Castle Hill? Hugh needs a lift.

29:24.439 --> 29:26.509
Pink slip is what Hugh needs.

29:27.319 --> 29:30.669
For a city employee making
an ass of himself in a public tavern.

29:30.709 --> 29:31.719
Yep.

29:34.359 --> 29:35.819
Nice to have friends.

29:44.469 --> 29:47.059
You know, Henry? They do it at night.

29:47.129 --> 29:50.129
They come in,
and they take out the mirrors…

29:50.389 --> 29:55.029
and they put in a piece of one-way glass
and stick a camera on the other side of it.

29:55.069 --> 29:58.929
Then they watch you,
and they laugh at you.

30:00.859 --> 30:03.889
And they take down every
single word you say.

30:06.359 --> 30:07.509
Yeah.

30:52.609 --> 30:56.389
–You're drenched to your soul.
–They threw me out!

30:56.959 --> 30:59.139
–I'm sorry.
–Here.

30:59.209 --> 31:03.809
Let me help you peel this thing off,
before you catch your death.

31:05.729 --> 31:08.259
You got a nice jacket in the window.

31:08.679 --> 31:13.729
A classic early-'50s beauty.
Warm as toast. Dry as a bone.

31:14.219 --> 31:19.037
It's just like the one I used to have
in high school, before I was a bum.

31:19.559 --> 31:21.469
When I was a kid.

31:21.549 --> 31:24.989
I'll bet there are quite a few people
in this shit pit of a town…

31:25.029 --> 31:27.269
who wouldn't believe
you ever were a kid.

31:27.309 --> 31:30.919
I know. It's not fair. I try so hard.

31:31.879 --> 31:35.079
Not hard enough. So they crushed you.

31:36.459 --> 31:39.759
They buried that wonderful boy
deep inside you.

31:39.979 --> 31:42.319
–Which boy?
–This one.

31:43.889 --> 31:45.829
We'll find him again, Hugh.

31:46.669 --> 31:49.059
We'll resurrect him together.

31:49.649 --> 31:54.279
Because, all of a sudden,
it's 1955 all over again.

32:11.889 --> 32:15.057
It was the best hour
of the best day of my life.

32:17.239 --> 32:21.069
–God, I loved that jacket.
–Which jacket? This one.

32:21.939 --> 32:27.179
This jacket, Hugh.
You could recover, retrace your steps.

32:27.759 --> 32:30.149
Take charge of your life again.

32:30.649 --> 32:32.819
God, this is still so beautiful.

32:33.049 --> 32:36.459
Say, Hugh, do you happen to know…

32:36.919 --> 32:40.329
a nice little Baptist lady
called Nettie Cobb?

32:40.629 --> 32:44.239
Sure. Crazy old wretch killed her husband.

32:44.919 --> 32:46.929
How much do you want for it?

33:07.519 --> 33:09.999
–Mr Gaunt?
–I am he.

33:10.079 --> 33:13.749
Reverend Rose, sir,
of the First Baptist Church of Castle Rock.

33:13.789 --> 33:17.299
May I take this opportunity
to welcome you to Castle Rock…

33:17.339 --> 33:19.249
on the good Lord's behalf?

33:19.969 --> 33:22.389
–Why not?
–Excellent.

33:22.459 --> 33:27.679
It's my unusual urgency when I ask,
what faith, sir, are you?

33:29.219 --> 33:32.379
–What faith?
–Religion.

33:34.149 --> 33:38.339
–You're not Catholic, are you?
–You might say that I am…

33:39.359 --> 33:42.619
nondenominational.
–I knew it!

33:42.819 --> 33:47.835
Then you will have little objection
to my placing this in your front window.

33:50.629 --> 33:52.477
I couldn't possibly do that.

33:54.209 --> 33:58.169
You see, I, like you,
am here to serve everyone.

33:58.729 --> 34:01.789
However, by way of compensation…

34:02.089 --> 34:05.659
perhaps I may offer you something,
which might interest you.

34:05.699 --> 34:07.679
Say, how about an objet d'art?

34:09.739 --> 34:14.559
What is your preference, Reverend?
Asian, Roman?

34:15.819 --> 34:18.268
That is 2nd century, Reverend.

34:19.909 --> 34:25.349
Wasn't it St Augustine who said,
“Make me chaste, O Lord.

34:26.219 --> 34:28.228
But not yet, not yet”?

34:39.728 --> 34:40.869
Father.

34:43.849 --> 34:45.059
Reverend.

35:05.269 --> 35:08.529
“Paper packages tied up with strings

35:09.199 --> 35:12.849
These are a few of my favorite things”

35:16.719 --> 35:21.259
Yes. I'm so thrilled.
Thank you, Mr Gaunt.

35:22.359 --> 35:25.169
Treasure Island. First edition, actually.

35:25.689 --> 35:28.395
Signed by Robert Louis Stevenson himself.

35:29.849 --> 35:32.979
–It's magnificent.
–Take a gander.

35:34.519 --> 35:38.083
If it's too hot in here, Mr Jewett,
just say the word.

35:39.739 --> 35:42.973
I'm afraid I have a tendency
to turn up the heat.

36:07.869 --> 36:09.179
Hello, Ms Chalmers.

36:09.249 --> 36:12.087
–My goodness. What's wrong?
–Where did you…

36:12.889 --> 36:14.519
How long have you been there?

36:14.559 --> 36:19.377
I was just hoping for a cup of coffee.
I didn't realize you were closing.

36:20.129 --> 36:22.019
Coffee? Sure, no problem.

36:23.969 --> 36:27.579
–You're Mr Gaunt.
–And you're Polly Chalmers.

36:29.699 --> 36:33.009
I'm sorry, I don't shake hands. I have…

36:33.349 --> 36:35.461
Arthritis. Forgive me. I forgot.

36:44.069 --> 36:48.359
You've been having a devil of a time
with it lately, haven't you?

36:49.029 --> 36:51.609
Yes. How did you know?

36:52.169 --> 36:53.629
Nettie told me.

36:55.269 --> 36:56.479
Here.

36:57.669 --> 37:01.035
Just a tiny thank-you note
for that remarkable pie.

37:07.559 --> 37:08.899
My Lord.

37:08.999 --> 37:12.233
I don't think I ever had
a tastier cup of coffee.

37:15.629 --> 37:19.039
You wouldn't, by any chance,
have something in the way of a doughnut?

37:19.079 --> 37:21.569
Something I might dunk, Ms Chalmers?

37:23.849 --> 37:28.139
Please, we're going to be neighbors.
Why don't you call me Polly?

37:51.919 --> 37:53.099
Go on.

37:59.059 --> 38:03.849
Oh, no! No! No! Shit!

38:08.279 --> 38:12.849
–Dan, it's me.
–Jesus! What the hell are you doing?

38:12.919 --> 38:15.659
You scared the hell out of me,
sneaking up on me like that.

38:15.699 --> 38:18.639
–Put the gun down, Dan.
–Yeah.

38:22.709 --> 38:26.539
Another couple of seconds, I would've been
out of here. You would've missed me.

38:26.579 --> 38:29.579
–What can I do for you?
–I had a call from the state auditors.

38:29.619 --> 38:30.609
Yeah?

38:30.679 --> 38:34.639
We have an Appropriations Committee
meeting next week to discuss budgets.

38:34.679 --> 38:37.899
–Guess what. It's on my calendar.
–They wanna be there.

38:37.939 --> 38:41.767
They want me to bring them printouts,
shit from city hall.

38:42.269 --> 38:46.509
Yeah, you know those bastards.
They're on some kind of fishing expedition.

38:46.549 --> 38:48.409
What the hell's going on?

38:53.529 --> 38:56.919
I've been having some bad luck
at the track lately.

38:58.009 --> 39:02.199
So I borrowed some money from the town
petty cash fund to cover the shortfall.

39:02.239 --> 39:03.549
Jesus, Dan.

39:04.289 --> 39:07.379
I'm gonna pay it back.
I was gonna pay it back before next week.

39:07.419 --> 39:10.679
–Honest to God.
–How much we talking about here?

39:11.579 --> 39:15.379
–$20,000.
–$20,000? Jesus Christ!

39:15.459 --> 39:18.899
I'm getting a loan on my dealership
to pay it back, from Boston.

39:18.939 --> 39:19.959
When?

39:20.259 --> 39:23.319
Any day now.
Two days, four days, next week.

39:23.429 --> 39:24.569
Four days?

39:29.509 --> 39:30.549
Done.

39:46.529 --> 39:48.769
You stall them for me, all right?

39:49.799 --> 39:52.967
–Yeah. I will. Till Monday.
–Okay, thanks a lot…

39:55.139 --> 39:59.229
–Believe me, I'll make it worth your while.
–Like hell, you will. Just pay it back.

39:59.269 --> 40:02.779
I just meant if you wanted a deal
on a new boat. It's all I meant, I swear.

40:02.819 --> 40:05.439
Whatever you want. And for Polly, too.

40:06.669 --> 40:08.847
–I'll get her a deal on…
–Monday!

40:23.469 --> 40:24.879
How's my boy?

40:26.029 --> 40:30.149
You have something that's mine, Brian,
that you haven't finished paying for.

40:30.189 --> 40:33.889
–But you said I could have it if…
–The dealing isn't done, you see…

40:33.929 --> 40:36.869
until Mr Gaunt says the dealing is done.

41:07.919 --> 41:09.479
And away they go!

41:09.559 --> 41:12.849
She's A Hell-Raiser breaks on top
and goes straight to the lead…

41:12.889 --> 41:15.149
 followed by Confucius Sings and Mr Lee.

41:15.189 --> 41:19.279
Lots Of Luck having a go wide, turning.
She's A Hell-Raiser…

41:20.919 --> 41:24.629
Yeah! Boy, what the hell?

41:26.009 --> 41:29.299
–That was pretty fine.
–Fine as paint.

41:29.499 --> 41:33.519
–Can I…
–Careful. See, this is no ordinary toy.

41:34.679 --> 41:39.439
–What is it?
–You see, the man who sold this to me…

41:40.759 --> 41:44.409
his father made their fortune from it.

41:45.049 --> 41:48.085
Every morning he'd take
the day's racing form…

41:48.379 --> 41:51.119
and run its races
before they ever happened…

41:51.159 --> 41:53.369
one by one, right on this board.

41:54.009 --> 41:57.839
He'd give each tin horse
the real name from the paper…

41:58.079 --> 42:01.109
do it just by touching and whispering.

42:02.529 --> 42:05.659
–A brand-new name.
–Citation.

42:05.949 --> 42:07.809
Sea Biscuit, Well Away…

42:08.539 --> 42:11.199
–Seattle Slew.
–Man O' War.

42:11.389 --> 42:13.369
Whoever were running that day.

42:13.569 --> 42:16.889
Wind her up, let her go.

42:17.089 --> 42:19.333
Run the whole damn slate that way!

42:19.459 --> 42:20.979
Northern Dancer.

42:21.279 --> 42:23.359
Eight, ten, a dozen races.

42:23.459 --> 42:26.169
Then go right to the track,
and bet on those fillies…

42:26.209 --> 42:29.971
that won on this astonishing toy
from Japan Incorporated.

42:30.019 --> 42:33.879
He'd rake in the cash, Dan.
Rake in the goddamn cash.

42:33.959 --> 42:35.709
Rake in the cash.

42:39.589 --> 42:40.799
How much?

42:49.829 --> 42:51.209
Good day to you.

42:51.269 --> 42:53.315
–Good morning, Father.
–Father.

42:53.319 --> 42:56.025
–What do you want?
–Coffee and the usual.

42:59.849 --> 43:01.219
Hey, Corn Cobb.

43:01.479 --> 43:04.581
–What's the button on your boob?
–You're crazy.

43:07.309 --> 43:11.019
–You leave me alone!
–Take it easy, Nettie.

43:11.429 --> 43:12.683
Put the knife down.

43:13.359 --> 43:14.699
Put it down.

43:20.109 --> 43:22.119
Okay, Wilma. What'll it be?

43:23.019 --> 43:27.939
Raider on rye, a little glass of puppy pus,
and two nice doggie eyes.

43:28.009 --> 43:31.177
–Why don't you just order up or get out?
–Wilma.

43:32.299 --> 43:35.399
–Shit.
–It's okay.

43:35.949 --> 43:37.639
I'll go talk to her.

43:58.579 --> 44:01.779
April Dreaming, Junction Salute.

44:02.159 --> 44:03.629
She's A Hell-Raiser.

44:04.949 --> 44:07.729
Tammy's Wonder, Easy Sweep.

44:08.469 --> 44:10.479
That's My Boy.

44:11.959 --> 44:16.079
Yes, okay, little puppies.
You ready now? Let's run a good race.

44:16.119 --> 44:19.019
–Ready, set, go!
–And away they go!

44:19.129 --> 44:21.769
And it's Tammy's Wonder. April Dreaming.

44:21.779 --> 44:25.673
Junction Salute on the outside.
And Easy Sweep is far back.

44:26.009 --> 44:28.789
–Into the far turn.
–Neck and neck!

44:29.529 --> 44:32.829
–Tammy's Wonder on the inside…
–Tammy's Wonder!

44:32.989 --> 44:37.741
Tammy's Wonder's gonna go on to win.
Tammy's Wonder from April Dreaming.

44:37.789 --> 44:41.529
We've got Love My Martinis, Trentier…

44:41.629 --> 44:44.309
Doubter's Ridge, Rancadoo…

44:44.479 --> 44:47.579
By George, and Confucius Sings.

44:47.679 --> 44:51.059
Little Chinese puppy.
Okay, fellas, now, let's go.

44:51.129 --> 44:53.239
Make money for daddy!

44:54.809 --> 44:56.189
And they're off!

44:57.629 --> 44:59.889
–It's the white one, the red one.
–Danforth?

44:59.929 --> 45:02.199
It's the green one. God, they're beautiful.

45:02.239 --> 45:06.229
Look at those beautiful horses!
Run, run, run! Come on!

45:06.939 --> 45:10.259
Come on. Come on, horsies.
Who's gonna win here?

45:12.349 --> 45:15.139
–Danforth?
–Goddamn it! Go away!

45:15.199 --> 45:16.849
I'll be out when I'm out.

45:16.959 --> 45:19.679
–Aren't you going to work?
–I am at work!

45:22.049 --> 45:24.249
Would you like me
to go down to the bakery…

45:24.289 --> 45:26.719
and maybe get some
honey-dipped doughnuts?

45:26.759 --> 45:30.849
Yeah. Honey-dipped doughnuts.

45:31.079 --> 45:35.099
Yeah, toilet paper, a nose job.
Just leave me alone!

45:35.559 --> 45:39.915
You ready now? Let's run a good race.
Ready, set, go! They're off!

45:39.939 --> 45:43.169
And they're coming around the corner.

45:44.679 --> 45:48.419
It's a runaway victory!
Yeah! Come on, come on!

45:48.579 --> 45:49.659
Yeah!

46:27.119 --> 46:28.909
Good boy. Sit.

46:32.979 --> 46:37.289
Stay. Mommy's got to go scoot
and do something for Mr Gaunt…

46:37.579 --> 46:39.279
before it gets dark.

46:41.069 --> 46:42.449
But don't you worry.

46:43.189 --> 46:46.357
Mommy's going to lock all our doors
from now on.

46:49.719 --> 46:50.759
Stay.

47:17.819 --> 47:19.129
Lovely day.

47:24.469 --> 47:25.849
Come on, girls.

47:29.209 --> 47:32.529
The crowd is tense.
Brian Rusk doing the pitching.

47:32.669 --> 47:36.949
And let me tell you, he is really
sensational. He's working on the no-hitter.

47:36.989 --> 47:40.689
We're in the bottom of the ninth inning.
A count of 2 and 2 on the batter.

47:40.729 --> 47:43.319
Two men on base,
but Brian has walked them both.

47:43.359 --> 47:46.579
Right now, he's checking the runners
leading off first and second.

47:46.619 --> 47:49.619
He's gotten the sign from the catcher,
the runners lead away…

47:49.659 --> 47:51.219
 and here's the pitch.

47:51.329 --> 47:54.169
Strike three! How about that?

47:55.359 --> 47:58.263
Will he make that no-hitter,
or will he not?

48:01.019 --> 48:04.599
Brian Rusk. Man alive!
Is he really sharp today.

48:04.669 --> 48:08.769
Sensational control
of his 90 mile-an-hour fast ball.

48:09.119 --> 48:12.947
Still the chance of the no-hitter,
and he's ready to work.

48:16.609 --> 48:20.609
Rusk has got a swift curve ball
that's dipping and darting.

48:20.679 --> 48:23.253
And his fast ball, they can't touch it.

48:23.809 --> 48:26.209
Brian Rusk is delivering a performance…

48:26.249 --> 48:29.149
 that can take the Yankees
to another World Series.

48:29.189 --> 48:30.649
How about that?

48:34.049 --> 48:38.149
Brian Rusk is ready, and he delivers.
And the pitch…

48:43.749 --> 48:45.159
Jesus Christ.

48:46.379 --> 48:47.689
Good girls.

48:55.269 --> 48:56.489
Yessiree.

48:57.199 --> 48:58.919
We're having fun now.

49:19.569 --> 49:20.909
Raider!

49:22.129 --> 49:23.649
Little pal!

49:32.529 --> 49:35.399
Raider. How they hanging?

49:40.719 --> 49:44.369
Good fella. Yeah. Ain't you?

49:44.529 --> 49:47.763
And ain't you got a face
just cute as a baby bug?

49:47.859 --> 49:49.769
Yes, you do.

49:49.839 --> 49:53.999
And you know what I got?
I got a beautiful jacket.

49:54.289 --> 49:55.699
Yes, I do.

49:56.439 --> 49:58.259
And you know what else?

49:58.769 --> 50:00.329
I'm gonna keep it.

50:15.379 --> 50:19.273
They're rounding the bend,
and yellow, and white, and pink…

50:32.279 --> 50:35.599
“Punky Boy.” Yeah.

51:06.719 --> 51:12.159
“Gasco Thunder, Hooded Lady,
Mr P, Lotsa Luck, and Rosie D…

51:13.159 --> 51:16.759
”…Punky Boy, Raise The Dead,
Frank's The Name, Gimme Shelter…

51:16.799 --> 51:18.209
…Sudden Fame.”

52:48.249 --> 52:51.021
God! I'll kill him! I'll fucking kill him!

52:51.249 --> 52:52.659
Ridgewick!

52:56.819 --> 52:57.969
Raider?

53:04.819 --> 53:06.229
Mommy's home.

53:07.379 --> 53:08.429
Raid?

55:19.409 --> 55:20.839
What the fuck?

55:27.029 --> 55:28.339
That bitch!

55:37.039 --> 55:39.179
You killed my doggie, you bitch!

55:40.119 --> 55:42.739
You broke my microwave, you crazy fuck!

56:13.659 --> 56:14.769
Wilma?

56:15.799 --> 56:17.329
See the windows?

56:18.399 --> 56:19.609
They're busted!

57:15.369 --> 57:17.699
Wilma? You all right?

57:35.839 --> 57:37.299
Come on, bitch.

57:38.049 --> 57:40.089
Come for me, if you're coming.

57:50.909 --> 57:52.019
Wilma.

57:57.909 --> 58:02.189
There's nothing quite so invigorating
as a crisp fall day in New England.

58:02.229 --> 58:04.599
–Don't you agree?
–Mr Gaunt…

58:04.659 --> 58:05.969
Leland.

58:07.769 --> 58:09.869
I'm sorry. I can't even think.

58:10.199 --> 58:15.339
Believe me, Polly, I know you're in pain,
so I shall dispense with the small talk.

58:15.379 --> 58:19.789
I'll give you the item I called you about
and send you home.

58:20.369 --> 58:22.119
–Give it to me?
–More or less.

58:22.159 --> 58:24.997
But let's leave that until later, shall we?

58:27.919 --> 58:29.989
When it rains, it pours.

58:37.609 --> 58:39.039
They're after me.

58:39.209 --> 58:43.009
Go upstairs, Mr Keeton, to my apartment.
Make yourself a nice cup of tea.

58:43.049 --> 58:45.639
–I'll be with you in a minute.
–I don't have a minute.

58:45.679 --> 58:47.169
Go upstairs.

59:09.859 --> 59:13.357
It was funny.
They were actually feeling much better.

59:13.409 --> 59:18.227
Then just a few minutes before you called,
they started swelling up like…

59:20.259 --> 59:23.159
I know a great deal about the past.

59:23.999 --> 59:26.619
Now, this is very, very old.

59:27.519 --> 59:28.729
Egyptian.

59:30.179 --> 59:34.739
–Not as old as the pyramids, but still…
–Do you have a glass of water?

59:34.779 --> 59:37.551
–I need to take my pills.
–Not any longer.

59:37.759 --> 59:41.049
You see, this is called an Azca.

59:41.759 --> 59:45.589
It is a tool of Bencalitis. White magic.

59:45.759 --> 59:50.289
–They say it wards off pain.
–Yes. Please, my pills.

59:51.129 --> 59:55.669
–Really, I'm not superstitious.
–Doesn't matter, Polly. This is.

59:58.419 --> 01:00:01.009
I'm sorry. Must be the storm.

01:00:04.409 --> 01:00:05.749
What storm?

01:00:06.969 --> 01:00:10.259
I assure you, there is one coming.

01:00:19.119 --> 01:00:23.879
Put it inside your sweater.
Wear it right next to your skin, Polly.

01:00:27.629 --> 01:00:30.949
My hands.
I can't even unbutton my sweater.

01:01:01.539 --> 01:01:03.849
You must never take it off, Polly.

01:01:05.319 --> 01:01:06.529
Not ever.

01:01:11.749 --> 01:01:16.119
A heinous double-murder,
or a bizarre act of revenge gone awry?

01:01:16.319 --> 01:01:19.157
Sheriff Alan Pangborn
is unable to comment.

01:01:48.219 --> 01:01:50.769
No, don't tell me.
They've been in your house.

01:01:50.809 --> 01:01:54.999
–They sent Norris Ridgewick.
–Yes. Yeah, how did you know?

01:01:56.349 --> 01:01:58.169
They're so predictable.

01:02:03.479 --> 01:02:04.849
I need your advice.

01:02:05.399 --> 01:02:07.729
I think I should kill Norris Ridgewick.

01:02:07.769 --> 01:02:11.889
No. That would make things
far too easy for them, Dan.

01:02:11.989 --> 01:02:15.289
They'd come get you,
hunt you down like an animal.

01:02:15.319 --> 01:02:18.279
Cop killer. No. They'd have a party.

01:02:18.359 --> 01:02:21.449
They'd get all liquored up
at Sheriff Pangborn's office.

01:02:21.489 --> 01:02:24.709
They'd go out to Homeland Cemetery
and urinate on your grave.

01:02:24.749 --> 01:02:25.799
Shit.

01:02:26.259 --> 01:02:28.109
I hate this place.

01:02:28.399 --> 01:02:32.029
–I hate these people.
–But they're all part of it, Dan.

01:02:32.079 --> 01:02:33.449
You know that.

01:02:33.519 --> 01:02:37.509
All your weasely fellow selectmen,
all your so-called friends.

01:02:37.549 --> 01:02:40.999
But Sheriff Pangborn,
he's the big-shot ringleader.

01:02:42.569 --> 01:02:46.279
He came in from the outside, Dan,
to take over your town.

01:02:46.319 --> 01:02:51.069
And, boy, would he love it
if you blew away one of his little drones.

01:03:00.419 --> 01:03:03.619
–So what should I do?
–Nothing.

01:03:03.909 --> 01:03:08.069
I'll keep this gun for a while.
Save you from yourself.

01:03:10.249 --> 01:03:14.909
You just go to the races tonight, Dan,
and win yourself a bundle.

01:03:15.619 --> 01:03:20.189
Sow confusion and uncertainty
amidst the enemy, yes?

01:03:20.259 --> 01:03:21.149
Yeah.

01:03:23.359 --> 01:03:25.629
Confusion and uncertainty.

01:03:27.649 --> 01:03:29.079
That's my boy.

01:03:29.569 --> 01:03:31.089
In the meantime…

01:03:31.899 --> 01:03:33.789
I'm laying my own plans.

01:03:35.229 --> 01:03:37.429
And when the great moment comes…

01:03:38.049 --> 01:03:40.759
for everything you do, Danforth…

01:03:41.569 --> 01:03:43.669
this one is for you.

01:03:48.479 --> 01:03:50.779
O mighty and eternal God…

01:03:51.069 --> 01:03:53.359
hear our prayers
for your daughter Wilma…

01:03:53.399 --> 01:03:56.501
whom you have taken
from this life to yourself.

01:03:57.429 --> 01:04:00.849
Grant her light, happiness, and peace.

01:04:02.099 --> 01:04:05.399
Let her pass in safety
through the gates of death…

01:04:09.009 --> 01:04:12.659
and dwell with all your saints
in the blessed light…

01:04:12.719 --> 01:04:15.919
“The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want.

01:04:15.989 --> 01:04:18.893
”He maketh me to lie down
in green pastures.

01:04:19.029 --> 01:04:21.603
”He leadeth me beside the still waters.

01:04:22.129 --> 01:04:23.849
”He restoreth my soul.

01:04:24.239 --> 01:04:26.859
”He leadeth me in the paths
of righteousness…

01:04:26.899 --> 01:04:28.239
”…for his namesake.

01:04:28.469 --> 01:04:30.889
Yea, though I walk through the valley…”

01:04:30.929 --> 01:04:32.389
Step aside, please.

01:04:32.979 --> 01:04:37.089
–I need to talk to the sheriff.
–Now, son, sheriff's got his hands full.

01:04:37.129 --> 01:04:40.165
You didn't happen to
see this happen, did you?

01:04:43.979 --> 01:04:44.959
No.

01:04:47.879 --> 01:04:50.585
You have any idea
who threw these apples?

01:04:51.849 --> 01:04:55.329
–No.
–Then maybe you better go on home.

01:04:58.569 --> 01:05:00.059
Watch it, kid.

01:05:00.489 --> 01:05:01.569
Easy.

01:05:02.219 --> 01:05:03.559
Easy, Brian.

01:05:07.299 --> 01:05:09.499
Why'd they do it,
I mean, if you had to guess?

01:05:09.539 --> 01:05:13.697
You're asking the wrong guy.
I don't understand anyone anymore.

01:05:19.039 --> 01:05:21.339
You want the knife or the cleaver?

01:05:34.239 --> 01:05:37.619
I can't believe somebody
didn't hear or see something.

01:05:37.659 --> 01:05:40.629
–Morning, Norris.
–Nice of you to drop by, Deputy Ridgewick.

01:05:40.669 --> 01:05:45.817
Went by Nettie's again this morning.
Found this in the alley behind her house.

01:05:47.769 --> 01:05:50.769
Yeah. I bet Wilma could've
done the job on the dog…

01:05:50.809 --> 01:05:52.591
with that knife, all right.

01:05:52.669 --> 01:05:56.589
Congratulations, Deputy. Nice work.
Run it for prints.

01:05:56.789 --> 01:06:00.139
–I'll bet you 10-to-1 they're not Wilma's.
–Why not?

01:06:00.179 --> 01:06:04.139
I mean, it figures, if Nettie threw
the apples, Wilma must've killed the dog.

01:06:04.179 --> 01:06:08.169
'Cause Nettie didn't throw those apples.
Would you go to someone to kill him…

01:06:08.209 --> 01:06:11.249
and spend a half hour
breaking their windows first?

01:06:11.289 --> 01:06:13.519
If Nettie didn't throw those apples,
who did?

01:06:13.559 --> 01:06:15.849
Maybe the same person
who killed the damn dog.

01:06:15.889 --> 01:06:18.599
–Where you going?
–I'm gonna pay Brian Rusk a visit.

01:06:18.639 --> 01:06:23.391
I want you to canvass the neighborhood.
Somebody must've seen something.

01:06:24.789 --> 01:06:28.519
I'm not shitting you. The most disgusting
murder I've seen in my six years.

01:06:28.559 --> 01:06:30.889
Even worse than the lady
with the meat grinder.

01:06:30.929 --> 01:06:33.989
–I don't want to hear.
–Hello, sheriff's department.

01:06:34.029 --> 01:06:37.639
–I'm sorry, Father. He's not here right now.
–Is this for me?

01:06:37.679 --> 01:06:40.999
I'll tell him. Thank you.
I have no idea what that is, Norris.

01:06:41.039 --> 01:06:44.869
It looks like a present, Norris.
Why don't you go and open it?

01:06:44.909 --> 01:06:48.169
Shit! Goddamn it! Get it off!

01:06:48.359 --> 01:06:51.139
–Get it off!
–Hold still, Norris.

01:06:52.839 --> 01:06:55.459
–Shit!
–There's a note come with it.

01:06:55.529 --> 01:06:59.139
–Let me see that.
–“Crip space is all yours now. ”

01:07:01.099 --> 01:07:03.099
Buster. That son of a bitch!

01:07:03.429 --> 01:07:06.589
–Damn!
–Should've read the card first.

01:07:09.799 --> 01:07:11.389
Brian, you around?

01:07:34.239 --> 01:07:38.259
Brian, hi. You were trying to tell me
something last night…

01:07:38.329 --> 01:07:41.167
back there at the Jerzyk farm,
weren't you?

01:07:41.529 --> 01:07:42.869
What was it?

01:07:43.609 --> 01:07:45.619
Nothing anymore.

01:07:46.969 --> 01:07:48.829
What's bothering you, son?

01:07:50.939 --> 01:07:54.169
–You don't have to be afraid.
–I'm not afraid.

01:07:54.589 --> 01:07:56.619
Between you and me, bullshit.

01:08:01.939 --> 01:08:05.289
–Look, he's a monster.
–A what? Who?

01:08:05.369 --> 01:08:09.679
I dreamt about him last night,
only he's real.

01:08:09.749 --> 01:08:12.619
Sometimes if you talk about it,
the scary stuff goes away.

01:08:12.659 --> 01:08:15.179
No. Not monsters.

01:08:15.639 --> 01:08:17.288
Even monsters, Bri.

01:08:25.969 --> 01:08:27.759
Don't come any closer.

01:08:29.459 --> 01:08:31.399
You'll get the stuff on you.

01:08:33.809 --> 01:08:35.629
Okay, Brian. Take it easy.

01:08:36.749 --> 01:08:38.209
Take it easy, now.

01:08:41.069 --> 01:08:44.389
Tell me what you're scared of,
and I know we can make it go away.

01:08:44.429 --> 01:08:45.439
No.

01:08:45.868 --> 01:08:49.988
It's too late. I got to go.
I got to go to Hell!

01:08:52.009 --> 01:08:53.569
What do you mean?

01:08:54.948 --> 01:08:56.738
Don't go in that store.

01:08:56.999 --> 01:08:59.779
–Don't go near it!
–Okay, I promise.

01:09:00.038 --> 01:09:03.709
I'll never go in there.
What store are you talking about?

01:09:03.749 --> 01:09:05.158
Needful Things?

01:09:05.569 --> 01:09:07.269
It's a poison place.

01:09:08.578 --> 01:09:10.368
And he's a poison man.

01:09:11.399 --> 01:09:13.049
Who's a poison man?

01:09:14.078 --> 01:09:15.359
Mr Gaunt.

01:09:17.089 --> 01:09:18.779
Only he's not a man.

01:09:28.448 --> 01:09:30.109
Mickey Mantle.

01:09:31.519 --> 01:09:32.948
1956.

01:09:33.979 --> 01:09:36.279
It's signed to you and everything.

01:09:36.479 --> 01:09:37.849
It's yours.

01:09:38.109 --> 01:09:41.139
Boy, you sure don't want to lose
something like this.

01:09:41.179 --> 01:09:42.868
Mickey Mantle sucks!

01:10:30.769 --> 01:10:32.429
You asshole!

01:10:32.499 --> 01:10:35.339
That's it for you. You're out of here!

01:10:35.469 --> 01:10:38.789
–Watch the jacket, Henry!
–About time he's out of here.

01:10:38.829 --> 01:10:40.489
Miserable little shit!

01:10:41.229 --> 01:10:43.809
I'm gonna fire his butt
first thing Monday morning.

01:10:43.849 --> 01:10:47.329
Everybody that's got it coming
is gonna get it now.

01:10:50.189 --> 01:10:51.709
Get out of here!

01:11:02.339 --> 01:11:04.069
You bastard!

01:11:29.889 --> 01:11:33.719
–Alan, what's wrong?
–Brian Rusk tried to kill himself.

01:11:34.879 --> 01:11:36.059
God.

01:11:37.049 --> 01:11:38.359
He's alive.

01:11:38.939 --> 01:11:41.843
But I was there,
and I could've stopped him.

01:11:44.089 --> 01:11:46.597
11-year-old kid tries to eat a bullet.

01:11:50.489 --> 01:11:52.079
–Why?
–I don't know.

01:11:57.369 --> 01:11:59.569
Polly, did Nettie…

01:12:00.889 --> 01:12:05.139
ever say anything to you about Gaunt?
Anything strange?

01:12:08.469 --> 01:12:10.029
What do you mean?

01:12:10.609 --> 01:12:13.513
You got any aspirin?
My head's ripped apart.

01:12:15.669 --> 01:12:17.319
Henry Beaufort.

01:12:17.939 --> 01:12:21.769
That bastard, runs the Mellow Tiger,
cut my tires…

01:12:21.939 --> 01:12:25.107
threw me out in the rain
in my beautiful jacket.

01:12:25.169 --> 01:12:28.403
Maybe then you should
just go take care of Henry…

01:12:28.429 --> 01:12:30.249
once and for all, Hugh.

01:12:32.879 --> 01:12:35.079
–Once and for all?
–Yeah.

01:12:37.129 --> 01:12:41.029
Don't be afraid of it, Hugh.
Guns don't kill people.

01:12:41.519 --> 01:12:43.009
People kill people.

01:12:44.559 --> 01:12:47.529
Hugh, I've been in this business
a long time.

01:12:47.909 --> 01:12:51.809
When I started out,
I was just a poor wandering peddler…

01:12:52.839 --> 01:12:55.229
on the blind face of a distant land.

01:12:55.369 --> 01:12:58.529
Moving, always moving. Always gone.

01:12:59.139 --> 01:13:01.049
Asia, Anatolia…

01:13:01.989 --> 01:13:04.739
Palestine, Macedonia…

01:13:04.999 --> 01:13:07.329
year after year after year.

01:13:08.419 --> 01:13:12.699
But in the end,
I always offered them weapons.

01:13:15.079 --> 01:13:16.899
And they always bought.

01:13:19.649 --> 01:13:23.069
But of course,
I was gone before they finally realized…

01:13:23.109 --> 01:13:24.889
what they'd purchased.

01:13:26.339 --> 01:13:27.609
Jesus.

01:13:29.279 --> 01:13:31.523
The young carpenter from Nazareth?

01:13:31.929 --> 01:13:35.159
I knew him well. Promising young man.

01:13:37.309 --> 01:13:38.739
He died badly.

01:13:45.789 --> 01:13:48.499
What is this? Gaunt gave this to you?

01:13:49.499 --> 01:13:53.657
–He didn't give it to me.
–It made the pain go away, didn't it?

01:13:55.669 --> 01:13:58.219
Take it off.
It's a disease that looks like a cure.

01:13:58.259 --> 01:13:59.409
Are you crazy?

01:13:59.479 --> 01:14:02.159
Take it off.
I want to see what's inside this thing.

01:14:02.199 --> 01:14:03.249
No!

01:14:07.349 --> 01:14:08.459
Jesus.

01:14:10.039 --> 01:14:13.159
What's the matter with you?
Don't you want me to feel better?

01:14:13.199 --> 01:14:17.449
–Take it easy, will you?
–No, you take it easy. They're my hands.

01:14:17.489 --> 01:14:20.393
You're not the one
who can't sleep at night.

01:14:20.499 --> 01:14:24.169
You're not the one with
the oversized buttons on the telephone.

01:14:24.209 --> 01:14:27.245
Yeah, and the oversized
Percodan prescription.

01:14:34.729 --> 01:14:35.749
Hello.

01:14:36.619 --> 01:14:41.359
Yes, he is. He's right here. Whoever he is.

01:14:42.699 --> 01:14:43.749
Yeah?

01:14:46.889 --> 01:14:50.749
Okay. That's what I thought.
Thanks, Norris.

01:14:52.329 --> 01:14:55.761
Mr Leland Gaunt never ran a business
in Akron, Ohio.

01:14:56.579 --> 01:14:57.759
You checked on him?

01:14:57.799 --> 01:15:01.209
He's a con man, or something worse.
There's been two murders…

01:15:01.249 --> 01:15:04.729
and an attempted suicide
in this quiet town in the last 48 hours…

01:15:04.769 --> 01:15:08.769
and Mr Gaunt is at the bottom of it.
–Wilma Jerzyk killed Nettie.

01:15:08.809 --> 01:15:11.549
Brian shot himself. You were there.

01:15:13.029 --> 01:15:17.179
–Where you going? It's pouring.
–Good. He'll be home.

01:18:06.289 --> 01:18:07.569
Put it on.

01:18:11.219 --> 01:18:14.539
Put it back on, Polly.
The pain will go away.

01:18:16.949 --> 01:18:18.219
I promise.

01:18:18.799 --> 01:18:22.449
What's inside it? I have to know.

01:18:23.539 --> 01:18:26.311
I'm terribly sorry. I can't tell you that.

01:18:26.669 --> 01:18:29.969
That would spoil the fun, wouldn't it?

01:18:47.179 --> 01:18:48.389
$20.

01:18:50.439 --> 01:18:54.049
Does that seem a fair price
to ease the pain?

01:18:59.589 --> 01:19:00.799
My purse.

01:19:04.839 --> 01:19:05.849
$20.

01:19:07.999 --> 01:19:09.599
And a small favor.

01:19:13.089 --> 01:19:14.749
What sort of favor?

01:19:57.339 --> 01:20:00.239
–He's a liar.
–No, he's not.

01:20:00.949 --> 01:20:02.739
–And a thief.
–No.

01:20:04.209 --> 01:20:06.159
Alan and old Buster Keeton…

01:20:06.259 --> 01:20:09.449
have been embezzling
from the town treasury, dear lady.

01:20:09.489 --> 01:20:11.599
And the tax man is closing in.

01:20:14.069 --> 01:20:16.643
Check his boat if you don't believe me.

01:20:17.169 --> 01:20:19.743
All he's going to do is cause you pain.

01:20:24.619 --> 01:20:25.969
Do as I say…

01:20:26.289 --> 01:20:28.929
and you'll never feel pain again, Polly.

01:20:31.049 --> 01:20:33.557
You see, when everything else is gone…

01:20:34.449 --> 01:20:38.269
isn't a young woman at least
entitled to her pride…

01:20:39.719 --> 01:20:43.151
the coin without which
your purse is entirely empty?

01:20:44.459 --> 01:20:45.469
Please.

01:20:50.889 --> 01:20:55.489
I've always enjoyed those ladies
who take great pride in themselves.

01:21:10.339 --> 01:21:13.705
Polly, you must realize
what a deep pleasure it is…

01:21:13.759 --> 01:21:15.649
doing business with you.

01:22:33.709 --> 01:22:34.759
Alan?

01:23:07.359 --> 01:23:10.019
–Wake up.
–Shit. Jesus Christ, Alan.

01:23:10.079 --> 01:23:14.489
–He was there. Every time, he was there.
–What? Who?

01:23:15.709 --> 01:23:17.059
Look at this.

01:23:17.119 --> 01:23:20.729
England, Ohio, Honolulu,
Chicago, Sacramento…

01:23:20.799 --> 01:23:23.449
Cuba, Castle Rock.

01:23:26.399 --> 01:23:30.389
–Who? Who was where?
–Gaunt. Mr Leland Gaunt.

01:23:30.459 --> 01:23:34.419
–Every goddamn time.
–Come on, Alan. 1894?

01:23:36.569 --> 01:23:39.275
–Sheriff's Department.
–It's Polly, Alan.

01:23:39.319 --> 01:23:41.619
Where are you?
I just tried calling your place.

01:23:41.659 --> 01:23:44.689
–I'm on your boat. How could you?
–How could I what?

01:23:44.729 --> 01:23:48.049
I want to find him. Call up Andy and John.
APB, the works.

01:23:48.089 --> 01:23:50.989
I also want an APB on Dan Keeton,
Hugh Priest.

01:23:51.029 --> 01:23:53.867
–I'm sorry. What?
–I found the money, Alan.

01:23:53.979 --> 01:23:57.419
–Hold it. What money?
–The money that you and Dan Keeton…

01:23:57.459 --> 01:23:59.789
have been embezzling
from the town treasury.

01:23:59.829 --> 01:24:03.209
Wait. What are you talking about?

01:24:03.289 --> 01:24:06.479
I can put two and two together, Alan.
I'm not stupid.

01:24:06.519 --> 01:24:09.199
I heard you covering up for him
with that tax guy.

01:24:09.239 --> 01:24:11.469
I saw the two of you at his dealership.

01:24:11.509 --> 01:24:15.667
I'm standing here looking at
thousands of dollars on your desk.

01:24:15.949 --> 01:24:18.309
Who's been planting
this idea in your head?

01:24:18.349 --> 01:24:20.869
You been talking to Gaunt?
Polly, listen to me.

01:24:20.909 --> 01:24:24.299
I don't know what you found,
but first of all, if I stole some money…

01:24:24.339 --> 01:24:26.729
you think I'd leave it
laying around on my desk?

01:24:26.769 --> 01:24:29.249
The guy is evil.

01:24:30.189 --> 01:24:33.389
Don't go near him. He's Brian's monster.

01:24:33.649 --> 01:24:37.219
Somehow… There are newspapers, Polly.

01:24:38.159 --> 01:24:39.979
He's not a human being.

01:24:40.909 --> 01:24:45.129
Andy, this is Norris. Listen.
Get over to the office right now.

01:24:45.259 --> 01:24:47.169
Don't ask why. Just do it.

01:24:48.459 --> 01:24:51.139
Polly, listen to me.
Stay where you are, okay?

01:24:51.179 --> 01:24:53.469
Stay there. I'm coming right over, okay?

01:24:53.509 --> 01:24:54.759
I'm coming home.

01:24:54.819 --> 01:24:57.279
Wait a minute.
What do you mean, “He's a monster?”

01:24:57.319 --> 01:25:00.355
I met the guy.
Listen, he looks like my uncle.

01:25:04.039 --> 01:25:05.349
My car!

01:25:09.249 --> 01:25:10.909
You son of a bitch!

01:25:15.749 --> 01:25:18.779
I'll get you! I'll get all of you!

01:25:20.189 --> 01:25:22.009
Get this, you fat fuck.

01:25:24.129 --> 01:25:26.879
Shit! Goddamn!

01:25:38.199 --> 01:25:40.919
Look! You think I wouldn't know…

01:25:41.309 --> 01:25:45.809
with your name on every goddamn ticket
making fun of me?

01:25:46.039 --> 01:25:48.049
God damn you, son of a bitch!

01:25:51.159 --> 01:25:53.601
You! The little prick worked for you!

01:26:00.919 --> 01:26:02.609
Son of a bitch.

01:26:02.679 --> 01:26:06.189
You gave that little kid your gun.
What the hell are you thinking, Keeton?

01:26:06.229 --> 01:26:08.299
Norris, you still alive?

01:26:10.519 --> 01:26:12.459
Can you handle this or not?

01:26:13.809 --> 01:26:18.119
Get your breath. Okay, you all right?
You okay? Look at me.

01:26:18.289 --> 01:26:20.869
–Yeah!
–Get your shit together.

01:26:20.939 --> 01:26:24.239
Lock this son of a bitch up.
I gotta go see Polly.

01:26:42.829 --> 01:26:44.199
Alone at last.

01:26:45.799 --> 01:26:47.739
You pathetic piece of shit.

01:26:50.029 --> 01:26:52.989
–I am not a piece of shit!
–Shut up!

01:26:54.919 --> 01:26:58.269
–This is for my surprise package.
–No!

01:27:00.129 --> 01:27:02.619
–No. Don't.
–Buster.

01:27:10.759 --> 01:27:11.739
Gotcha.

01:27:27.549 --> 01:27:28.659
Polly.

01:27:30.689 --> 01:27:31.899
You here?

01:27:33.179 --> 01:27:34.199
Pol?

01:28:23.059 --> 01:28:24.199
Myrtle!

01:28:29.259 --> 01:28:30.439
Come on!

01:28:32.619 --> 01:28:33.769
Myrtle!

01:28:37.869 --> 01:28:39.915
I thought you died on the John.

01:28:41.259 --> 01:28:42.399
Danforth.

01:28:42.919 --> 01:28:45.379
–What's wrong?
–Nothing's wrong.

01:28:45.549 --> 01:28:47.709
Things are better
than they've been in years.

01:28:47.749 --> 01:28:50.257
I just need a little help, that's all.

01:28:50.919 --> 01:28:55.099
–Danforth, you're handcuffed to the door.
–Aren't you the fucking genius?

01:28:55.139 --> 01:28:56.859
Give me that hacksaw, will you?

01:28:56.899 --> 01:28:58.879
–What did you do?
–Forget the hacksaw.

01:28:58.919 --> 01:29:01.823
Give me that hammer
and the big screwdriver.

01:29:02.499 --> 01:29:04.129
Now, you moron!

01:29:07.269 --> 01:29:11.389
–Where do you think you're going?
–Danforth, I can't reach.

01:29:13.629 --> 01:29:16.699
That's a drill. Did I ask for a drill?

01:29:17.309 --> 01:29:20.829
–Why won't you help me?
–Danforth, I can't see.

01:29:20.899 --> 01:29:23.319
I guess you want me to let you go…

01:29:23.519 --> 01:29:26.869
so you can run back in the house
and call them.

01:29:30.109 --> 01:29:33.269
That's one.
Now how about trying for two?

01:29:38.839 --> 01:29:39.889
Yeah.

01:29:51.639 --> 01:29:54.769
Danforth, you broke the law, didn't you?

01:29:55.989 --> 01:29:57.929
Did I break their law?

01:29:58.969 --> 01:30:02.349
How about you, Myrtle?
Did you break the law?

01:30:02.899 --> 01:30:05.319
Did you sleep with him
just to humiliate me?

01:30:05.359 --> 01:30:09.419
–Who? Did I what?
–Norris Ridgewick…

01:30:10.039 --> 01:30:13.099
Did you fuck him after the two of you…

01:30:13.229 --> 01:30:15.949
put up all those parking tickets
all over my house?

01:30:15.989 --> 01:30:18.829
No. And it's our house, Buster.

01:30:48.329 --> 01:30:51.299
Stop looking at me, all of you!

01:30:53.479 --> 01:30:54.819
Who are you?

01:30:57.699 --> 01:31:02.309
It's me, Dan. Your master's voice.
How is it going?

01:31:02.889 --> 01:31:06.459
I killed my wife. Is that wrong?

01:31:07.009 --> 01:31:10.139
–I didn't mean to.
–These things happen.

01:31:10.689 --> 01:31:15.549
–Did she deserve it?
–I don't know. I really loved her.

01:31:16.189 --> 01:31:19.929
There are those times when you
simply must hurt the ones you love, Dan.

01:31:19.969 --> 01:31:24.119
I just can't picture Danforth Keeton
doing something to someone…

01:31:24.159 --> 01:31:28.119
who didn't deserve it.
You aren't that kind of guy, are you?

01:31:28.449 --> 01:31:29.429
No.

01:31:31.839 --> 01:31:35.601
–I don't know anymore.
–Get a hold of yourself, Danforth.

01:31:35.609 --> 01:31:37.819
It's no good, all this self-pity.

01:31:37.949 --> 01:31:40.119
Why don't you hop in your car,
come see me?

01:31:40.159 --> 01:31:44.383
I've got something for you.
I think you'll get a bang out of it.

01:32:10.479 --> 01:32:11.979
“Holy Mary, Mother of God.

01:32:12.019 --> 01:32:15.979
Pray for us sinners now and
at the hour of our death. Amen.”

01:32:40.999 --> 01:32:42.409
Hello, Henry.

01:32:48.459 --> 01:32:49.799
Hello, Hugh.

01:32:56.329 --> 01:32:57.409
Amen.

01:32:57.539 --> 01:33:00.319
“Holy Mary, Mother of God,
pray for us sinners now…

01:33:00.359 --> 01:33:02.801
…and at the hour of our death. Amen.”

01:33:03.679 --> 01:33:07.769
–Who are you talking to, Danny boy?
–God. Just God.

01:33:08.039 --> 01:33:09.339
On my time?

01:33:09.479 --> 01:33:12.279
I just want to tell you
that I'm really scared.

01:33:12.319 --> 01:33:15.619
You tell me nothing. I tell you everything.

01:33:17.179 --> 01:33:20.875
–They have it coming, Dan. You know that.
–Yeah, I know.

01:33:20.929 --> 01:33:24.339
Why don't you just crush them all now?
Just split the earth wide open?

01:33:24.379 --> 01:33:26.359
Because I don't work miracles.

01:33:27.199 --> 01:33:30.039
I'm not the Father, the Son,
and the Holy Ghost.

01:33:30.079 --> 01:33:32.599
I'm just one lonely guy.

01:33:33.019 --> 01:33:35.349
Please.

01:33:35.679 --> 01:33:39.419
I just want to die.
Please, I just want to die.

01:33:39.639 --> 01:33:41.909
I won't disappoint you. I promise.

01:33:42.649 --> 01:33:45.069
Come see me when you're done. Now dig.

01:33:45.109 --> 01:33:47.729
I'll dig. Look.

01:33:48.469 --> 01:33:49.679
I'll dig.

01:33:51.579 --> 01:33:55.279
Dig. Dig! I'm digging!

01:33:55.959 --> 01:33:59.059
–You are disgusting, Dan.
–Yes.

01:33:59.249 --> 01:34:01.079
I like that in a person.

01:34:02.709 --> 01:34:04.499
Yes. Thank you.

01:34:04.759 --> 01:34:06.729
Thank you.

01:34:25.069 --> 01:34:29.409
Sorry about Buster. I fucked up.
I'll get that son of a bitch.

01:34:45.959 --> 01:34:47.299
Who's there?

01:34:50.539 --> 01:34:51.749
Alan.

01:34:52.329 --> 01:34:53.599
It's late.

01:34:57.829 --> 01:35:01.195
–I need to talk to you, Father.
–What's the matter?

01:35:03.559 --> 01:35:07.419
–Do you believe in the Devil, Father?
–I guess I have to.

01:35:07.879 --> 01:35:10.321
You can't have one without the other.

01:35:11.139 --> 01:35:13.149
Do you believe in God, Alan?

01:35:14.559 --> 01:35:16.737
–What's he look like?
–Look like?

01:35:17.629 --> 01:35:20.863
Yeah.
The Devil, what the hell does he look like?

01:35:22.559 --> 01:35:25.239
He looks like you and me, I imagine.

01:35:25.759 --> 01:35:29.719
So he could get his claws in us
without our ever knowing it.

01:35:29.789 --> 01:35:33.089
Make us do things
that we normally would never do.

01:35:35.039 --> 01:35:39.479
–Terrible things.
–No, I don't think so, Alan.

01:35:39.959 --> 01:35:41.459
People have a choice.

01:35:46.969 --> 01:35:49.819
–This is a good town.
–Right.

01:35:50.839 --> 01:35:52.499
It was a good town.

01:35:54.389 --> 01:35:56.567
A lot of decent, ordinary people.

01:35:59.189 --> 01:36:03.149
–Only now the Devil is here.
–The Devil's always here, Alan.

01:36:03.249 --> 01:36:04.719
He's always in our hearts.

01:36:04.759 --> 01:36:07.399
But with the good Lord's help,
we can help cast him out.

01:36:07.439 --> 01:36:11.629
Not in our fucking hearts.
In our town, right outside, in our streets.

01:36:11.669 --> 01:36:13.669
The Devil is in Castle Rock.

01:36:15.189 --> 01:36:17.069
His name's Leland Gaunt.

01:36:24.719 --> 01:36:25.929
Father.

01:36:27.849 --> 01:36:30.159
I need your help to get rid of him.

01:36:32.139 --> 01:36:35.999
No. Leland Gaunt is a decent man.

01:36:37.609 --> 01:36:38.919
My God.

01:36:39.559 --> 01:36:41.219
He got to you, too.

01:36:41.929 --> 01:36:46.659
If there's a devil in this town,
it's that damned Reverend Willie Rose.

01:37:14.779 --> 01:37:16.669
You believe me now, Father?

01:37:24.159 --> 01:37:26.459
You still think he's a decent man?

01:37:26.649 --> 01:37:30.873
–The Devil just blew up your damn church!
–That's not the Devil.

01:37:31.039 --> 01:37:33.039
It's those goddamn Baptists!

01:37:35.229 --> 01:37:36.469
Rose!

01:37:58.709 --> 01:38:01.739
Rose! Damn you to hell!

01:38:20.719 --> 01:38:22.609
No!

01:39:02.019 --> 01:39:03.159
Father!

01:39:11.589 --> 01:39:14.489
–Get out of here!
–Kill them!

01:39:17.019 --> 01:39:18.229
Look out!

01:39:26.169 --> 01:39:29.019
Son of a bitch! I'll teach you.

01:39:35.199 --> 01:39:37.649
Frank! What are you doing?

01:39:37.719 --> 01:39:40.623
–The bastard took my Treasure Island.
–What?

01:39:40.669 --> 01:39:42.869
Robert Stevenson, first edition!

01:39:44.409 --> 01:39:45.999
Get out of my way!

01:39:48.599 --> 01:39:50.739
–You okay?
–I think so.

01:39:51.099 --> 01:39:52.559
–You all right?
–Yeah.

01:39:52.629 --> 01:39:54.675
Go home. Watch some television.

01:39:58.419 --> 01:40:00.795
–That's my needful thing!
–Fuck you!

01:40:38.949 --> 01:40:40.839
You crazy son of a bitch!

01:40:53.769 --> 01:40:55.459
Get away from there!

01:40:56.259 --> 01:40:57.819
Come on, move it!

01:41:00.579 --> 01:41:01.559
Go!

01:41:04.679 --> 01:41:05.849
Move it!

01:41:25.819 --> 01:41:28.657
Jesus Christ, Alan, all hell's broke loose.

01:41:28.669 --> 01:41:32.179
The Baptists are running around crazy
'cause their church is on fire.

01:41:32.219 --> 01:41:36.047
Plus somebody went and killed
Myrtle Keeton with a hammer.

01:41:36.089 --> 01:41:38.989
What the hell happened here? Jesus.

01:41:40.919 --> 01:41:43.097
–You son of a bitch!
–Norris, no!

01:41:54.869 --> 01:41:57.459
–You all right?
–What?

01:41:57.719 --> 01:42:00.589
–Are you all right?
–Never felt better.

01:42:03.859 --> 01:42:05.311
Call the state police.

01:42:06.609 --> 01:42:09.519
–Tell them we got a riot on our hands.
–My pleasure.

01:42:09.559 --> 01:42:13.869
Rose! In the name of Christ, man,
beg for his mercy…

01:42:13.969 --> 01:42:15.819
'cause you'll get none from me.

01:42:15.859 --> 01:42:19.569
Be struck down
by his almighty, swift sword!

01:42:19.629 --> 01:42:22.059
–Stop it!
–Meehan, you godless heathen!

01:42:22.099 --> 01:42:23.979
Rot in hell, Willie Rose!

01:42:35.889 --> 01:42:39.149
Drop it! Father, stop it! You'll kill him.

01:42:39.209 --> 01:42:40.419
Fuck you!

01:42:40.749 --> 01:42:43.779
Goddamn it, stop it,
or I'll blow your fucking head off!

01:42:43.819 --> 01:42:45.379
Now, there's an idea.

01:42:46.829 --> 01:42:48.769
–Put the ax down now.
–Go to hell.

01:42:48.809 --> 01:42:50.299
–Shoot him.
–Put it down!

01:42:50.339 --> 01:42:52.519
–Fuck you!
–Kill him. Kill him.

01:42:52.679 --> 01:42:55.121
Kill them all. Let God sort them out.

01:42:58.439 --> 01:43:00.479
No!

01:43:07.009 --> 01:43:07.959
No!

01:43:10.079 --> 01:43:11.839
You wussy.

01:43:12.899 --> 01:43:14.429
No more killing.

01:43:15.869 --> 01:43:19.999
Not in Castle Rock!
Not me, not you, not anybody!

01:43:20.069 --> 01:43:22.199
This shit stops now!

01:43:24.419 --> 01:43:25.819
Listen to me.

01:43:26.779 --> 01:43:28.089
All of you.

01:43:29.409 --> 01:43:30.549
This…

01:43:31.549 --> 01:43:33.179
man here…

01:43:34.399 --> 01:43:35.859
Leland Gaunt…

01:43:38.269 --> 01:43:39.699
We're waiting.

01:43:40.639 --> 01:43:43.569
He came here to destroy us.

01:43:44.669 --> 01:43:47.379
To make us destroy ourselves.

01:43:48.759 --> 01:43:52.653
Can't you see what's happening here?
This is what he needs.

01:43:53.139 --> 01:43:54.869
This is what he wants.

01:43:55.219 --> 01:43:59.629
He's got us all lined up
like a bunch of human fuse boxes.

01:44:01.399 --> 01:44:05.899
He hot wires Wilma Jerzyk to Nettie Cobb,
except he does it with wires…

01:44:05.939 --> 01:44:07.699
from two other fuse boxes:

01:44:07.759 --> 01:44:11.149
Brian Rusk and whoever it was
that skinned the poor dog…

01:44:11.189 --> 01:44:14.119
because it wasn't Wilma, was it, Pete?
–No, sir.

01:44:14.159 --> 01:44:16.619
Then he crosswires all the rest of us
the same way.

01:44:16.659 --> 01:44:19.563
What did he make you do,
Eddie, Myra, Frank?

01:44:20.299 --> 01:44:22.029
How about you, Karen?

01:44:22.129 --> 01:44:25.693
What price did you have to pay
for your needful thing?

01:44:28.849 --> 01:44:30.159
Father Meehan…

01:44:30.569 --> 01:44:32.813
Reverend Rose, look at yourselves.

01:44:33.549 --> 01:44:34.499
Cora.

01:44:35.209 --> 01:44:39.849
Your little boy's in a hospital
because he knew what this man is.

01:44:40.649 --> 01:44:45.269
And he tried to tell me, but I got
sucked in just like everybody else.

01:44:45.319 --> 01:44:47.299
Don't you see what he's done?

01:44:48.429 --> 01:44:50.309
We're all decent people.

01:44:51.109 --> 01:44:52.259
We are.

01:44:52.779 --> 01:44:56.669
And he's preyed on our weaknesses
and our hatred and our greed…

01:44:56.709 --> 01:44:58.949
and our prejudice and our fear.

01:45:00.839 --> 01:45:04.799
Don't you understand? He runs on hate.

01:45:07.299 --> 01:45:11.359
And he's used it
to turn us all against each other.

01:45:13.599 --> 01:45:15.509
Wilma Jerzyk, Nettie Cobb.

01:45:17.379 --> 01:45:20.219
Dan Keeton, Norris Ridgewick.

01:45:20.709 --> 01:45:23.289
Alan Pangborn and Polly Chalmers.

01:45:35.289 --> 01:45:38.259
He made me steal Mr Jewett's
Treasure Island.

01:45:39.609 --> 01:45:42.029
Frank, what did he make you do?

01:45:42.969 --> 01:45:45.819
He made me rip up
Ruth Roberts' flower bed.

01:45:46.589 --> 01:45:49.389
He made me send that letter
to Father Meehan.

01:45:49.429 --> 01:45:52.069
I gave the rat trap to Norris Ridgewick.

01:45:53.909 --> 01:45:57.419
He had me slash Hugh Priest's tires.

01:45:58.809 --> 01:46:02.505
I was the one
that planted the money on your boat, Alan.

01:46:02.549 --> 01:46:06.129
–I'm sorry.
–This is pathetic. You're all so pathetic.

01:46:06.199 --> 01:46:10.469
Look at you. Puppets, all of you.
And he's pulling the strings.

01:46:11.159 --> 01:46:15.629
Listen, I dealt as I always do.
I show people what I have to sell…

01:46:15.759 --> 01:46:18.829
and then I let them
make up their own mind.

01:46:18.989 --> 01:46:20.929
Is that so wrong? I ask you.

01:46:21.359 --> 01:46:23.179
You're done here, Gaunt.

01:46:25.229 --> 01:46:26.659
You're busted.

01:46:27.469 --> 01:46:29.509
You're finished in this town.

01:46:32.619 --> 01:46:33.669
Alan!

01:46:38.379 --> 01:46:41.811
Anybody's finished in this town,
it's you, Pangborn.

01:46:41.869 --> 01:46:45.669
–Finally, a man with some sense.
–You guys sound like a fucking AA meeting.

01:46:45.709 --> 01:46:47.879
“Hi. My name is Dan…

01:46:48.229 --> 01:46:51.649
…and I'm here to blow up
your fucking town.”

01:46:52.619 --> 01:46:54.619
You're all gonna pay big.

01:46:56.099 --> 01:46:58.039
Pay huge!

01:47:00.099 --> 01:47:03.769
–Be calm, folks. Don't give him a reason.
–I got a reason, you shithead.

01:47:03.809 --> 01:47:07.099
–I got a lifetime full of reasons.
–Talk, talk, talk.

01:47:07.139 --> 01:47:10.399
–Just blow them away, Dan.
–Don't do it, Dan.

01:47:10.599 --> 01:47:14.069
Don't let this third-rate bastard
turn you into something worse than he is.

01:47:14.109 --> 01:47:15.709
Shut up, Pangborn!

01:47:16.349 --> 01:47:19.649
It's too late. Don't move. Don't you move.

01:47:19.939 --> 01:47:22.109
Time's running out, Buster.

01:47:25.599 --> 01:47:27.449
I killed my Myrtle already.

01:47:28.219 --> 01:47:30.809
Now I just got to die.

01:47:33.979 --> 01:47:37.969
No, you don't, Dan.
You didn't kill your Myrtle.

01:47:38.519 --> 01:47:39.669
He did.

01:47:40.599 --> 01:47:43.305
–You don't have to do this.
–Yes, you do.

01:47:45.109 --> 01:47:46.839
–Yes, I do.
–Yes, you do.

01:47:46.939 --> 01:47:47.889
I do.

01:47:49.719 --> 01:47:54.229
Then take me with you.
Just me. I'm the ringleader.

01:47:54.579 --> 01:47:56.691
–Let these other people go.
–No.

01:47:56.729 --> 01:47:57.939
No.

01:47:58.009 --> 01:48:01.903
For Christ's sake,
put this town out of its misery, Buster.

01:48:02.009 --> 01:48:03.569
They're whipping you, Buster.

01:48:03.609 --> 01:48:07.119
They're making you walk their walk
and talk their talk.

01:48:07.159 --> 01:48:10.869
–Just do it, Buster.
–You're just like the rest of them.

01:48:11.509 --> 01:48:12.719
It's you!

01:48:13.869 --> 01:48:16.779
It was you all along, you cocksucker.

01:48:16.849 --> 01:48:21.337
Sticks and stones will break my bones,
but names will never hurt me.

01:48:24.819 --> 01:48:29.419
–Yeah, you killed my Myrtle.
–Get back.

01:48:32.049 --> 01:48:35.339
Don't blame me.
“Blame it on the bossa nova.”

01:48:35.849 --> 01:48:38.309
How about you take
some responsibility yourself…

01:48:38.349 --> 01:48:40.449
for once in your life, Buster?

01:48:45.229 --> 01:48:47.559
I just got one thing to say to you.

01:48:49.069 --> 01:48:51.329
Don't call me Buster.

01:49:17.119 --> 01:49:18.299
God!

01:49:49.339 --> 01:49:50.859
It's all right.

01:50:03.379 --> 01:50:06.129
–You okay, buddy?
–Yeah. You?

01:50:18.829 --> 01:50:21.069
Shouldn't have called him Buster.

01:50:42.669 --> 01:50:46.459
You know,
there are days when I really hate this job.

01:50:47.339 --> 01:50:50.599
This is not my best work,
not by a long shot.

01:50:51.589 --> 01:50:55.999
Sure, a few murders
and a couple of rather lovely explosions.

01:50:56.519 --> 01:51:00.739
I would hardly call it a rousing success,
but what the hell?

01:51:01.219 --> 01:51:02.399
I'll be back.

01:51:03.909 --> 01:51:07.739
In the meantime, you and Polly,
you are two terrific kids.

01:51:07.939 --> 01:51:10.079
And you'll marry her. Trust me.

01:51:10.369 --> 01:51:14.197
She's a lovely girl, Alan.
You'll have a wonderful family.

01:51:14.979 --> 01:51:18.289
By the way,
give my regards to your grandson.

01:51:18.369 --> 01:51:22.139
Bob will be his name,
international trade his game.

01:51:22.749 --> 01:51:25.749
I'll see him in Jakarta, 2053.

01:51:26.299 --> 01:51:30.609
August 14th, 10:00 a.m. A nice, sunny day.

01:51:33.399 --> 01:51:36.819
We'll make headlines. Catch.

01:52:06.869 --> 01:52:08.299
Look out.
