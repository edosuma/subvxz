Second off, there ain't no such thing

just selling the, the Bowie?

It's all or nothing.

10:29.755 --> 10:32.132
And I need them out of here by tonight.

the cheating bastard out on his heels

to that dimwitted 23‐year‐old
Pilates instructor, Sugarbaby.

11:28.021 --> 11:31.859
Frankly, I can't tell if I'm heartbroken
or merely disappointed

11:31.859 --> 11:33.569
in his utter lack of originality.

11:34.695 --> 11:37.990
In any case, he's coming by tomorrow
to pick up the rest of his belongings:

11:37.990 --> 11:39.116
that hideous chair,

11:39.116 --> 11:42.578
that horrible Damien Hirst painting
he overpaid for at Christie's,

11:42.578 --> 11:45.539
and of course his most beloved
and cherished possession:

11:45.539 --> 11:46.915
his record collection.

12:12.316 --> 12:14.151
‐ If this is for revenge,

12:14.151 --> 12:16.820
why don't you just light them on fire?

NOREEN: Because,

12:19.656 --> 12:20.657
young man,

12:21.491 --> 12:22.618
I'm an artist.

12:23.577 --> 12:25.913
And mere destruction wouldn't imbue

12:25.913 --> 12:27.831
the same poetic vengeance.

12:28.373 --> 12:33.337
When that perfidious shitheel comes
to collect his precious records,

12:33.337 --> 12:36.673
what he'll find in their place
is a framed,

12:37.257 --> 12:38.550
perfectly crisp

12:39.468 --> 12:40.594
$20 bill.

12:41.345 --> 12:42.513
I already bought the frame.

12:42.971 --> 12:43.972
And that

12:44.515 --> 12:47.017
sniveling... manchild

12:48.101 --> 12:50.103

somewhere out there,

12:51.647 --> 12:54.566
some stranger whom he's never met,

12:54.566 --> 12:58.862
is deriving great pleasure
from the only thing in the world

13:00.030 --> 13:01.198

13:20.926 --> 13:23.720
I give you, like... three grand?

13:23.720 --> 13:25.514
‐ If you're not interested in my price,

13:25.931 --> 13:29.226
I'm still expecting a call
from a gentleman from Tough Trade.

13:29.226 --> 13:31.645
‐ Oh, Lionel? That guy's the worst.

13:31.645 --> 13:34.731
‐ Regardless of who takes them,
I need them gone by tonight.

13:35.190 --> 13:36.942
‐ Okay, how about a thousand?
‐ Twenty dollars.

13:36.942 --> 13:38.485
‐ Five hundred, that's as low as I can go.

Twenty... dollars.

Okay.
Yeah. Yeah. Twenty dollars.

18:34.031 --> 18:36.158
that's ever been done.
You've got to check it out.

18:36.158 --> 18:38.619
<i>‐ Wings Over America</i> was 1976, no?

18:38.619 --> 18:39.620
‐ Oh.

18:43.707 --> 18:45.417
‐ You a big Paul McCartney fan?

18:47.211 --> 18:48.795
‐ Big enough to know
when that album came out,

18:48.795 --> 18:49.963
which was 1976.

18:49.963 --> 18:51.798
‐ No, sweet pea. You're wrong.

18:53.425 --> 18:55.135
‐ You're talking about
the triple live album, right?

18:55.135 --> 18:56.345
‐ Now you got it. There you go.

18:56.345 --> 18:58.055
‐ From the <i>Wings Over The World tour?</i>
‐ Mm‐hmm.

18:58.055 --> 18:59.473
‐ Mostly from their show
in L. A. that summer?

18:59.473 --> 19:00.599
‐ Yep.

19:00.599 --> 19:02.059
‐ Yeah, that was 1976.

19:02.643 --> 19:03.977
Yeah, I love that album.

19:03.977 --> 19:05.270
I love it too, man, but, um,

19:05.270 --> 19:06.939
you know, I always wanna take away points

19:06.939 --> 19:08.857
for all those vocal overdubs, you know.

19:08.857 --> 19:11.401
I mean, at what point is a live album
not a live album, right?

19:12.236 --> 19:15.822
That being said, it has
that sick version of <i>Maybe I'm Amazed</i>

19:15.822 --> 19:18.742
which completely destroys the original,
so I give it a pass for that.

19:19.618 --> 19:20.536
Oh.

19:21.662 --> 19:22.913
Thanks, Eddy.
EDDY: Mm‐hmm.

19:22.913 --> 19:25.040
‐ Got yourself quite a little firecracker
there, don'tcha, pal?

19:25.832 --> 19:26.875
‐ Yeah.

19:26.875 --> 19:29.586
‐ Listen, a word of advice,

19:30.712 --> 19:33.006
it's all cute now, but it gets old.

19:33.006 --> 19:34.007
Fast.

19:34.591 --> 19:35.592
Trust me.

19:36.260 --> 19:38.512
‐ Jesus Christ!

19:38.512 --> 19:40.931
‐ Jesus, what an asshole!

19:41.306 --> 19:43.934
‐ That was like, that was like being
a woman in a Michael Bay movie.

19:43.934 --> 19:44.935
‐ What about her?

19:44.935 --> 19:46.687
‐ Like, blink twice
if you need help, right?

19:46.687 --> 19:48.146
‐ Did not introduce her!
‐ At all!

19:48.146 --> 19:49.648
‐ Nothing.
‐ What a dick!

19:49.648 --> 19:51.316
‐ What a dick.

19:51.316 --> 19:52.192
‐ Wow.

19:52.526 --> 19:53.610
‐ Oh!
‐ What?

19:54.528 --> 19:56.196
‐ [sighs] I forgot to pee.

19:56.196 --> 19:57.698
‐ Come on. You can pee at Noreen's.

19:58.198 --> 20:00.117
‐ That's what I'm talkin' about!
That's what I'm talkin' about!

20:03.871 --> 20:05.038
‐ Hey.
CLYDE: Hey.

20:05.497 --> 20:07.541
‐ How are you?
Oh, wow.

20:08.542 --> 20:10.002
‐ Okay.
‐ What's happening to Andy?

20:10.586 --> 20:11.545
‐ He's going home.

20:13.088 --> 20:14.715
‐ How are you, Rob?
‐ What's up?

20:14.715 --> 20:17.843
‐ This is the lovely girl from
the record shop I was telling you about.

20:17.843 --> 20:18.886
‐ Hi.
‐ Hi.

20:19.928 --> 20:21.013
Sorry it took so long.

20:21.013 --> 20:22.431
‐ I told them you'd be back.

20:22.431 --> 20:24.141
‐ Hey, that's a cool one, Noreen.

20:24.600 --> 20:25.684
‐ That's‐‐
NOREEN: Uh‐‐

20:25.684 --> 20:26.602
‐ Are those credit cards?

20:26.602 --> 20:28.896
‐ Although there was a moment,
there was a brief moment,

20:28.896 --> 20:30.522
when I thought that you wouldn't.

20:30.856 --> 20:33.192
Well, it didn't really matter
very much to me at first, but

20:33.817 --> 20:35.694
then after an hour
of thinking about it

20:35.694 --> 20:39.990
and conceptualizing
and reconceptualizing‐‐

20:40.282 --> 20:42.284
Oh, yeah, just slide it on through!

20:42.284 --> 20:44.203
‐ You got it.
‐ We don't have to be precious about it.

20:44.203 --> 20:46.455
Conceptualizing and reconceptualizing,

20:46.455 --> 20:48.707
it occurred to me
that this piece is incomplete.

20:48.707 --> 20:51.210
"Noreen," I said, "This is a gift.

20:51.210 --> 20:54.880
This kinship you feel
with the little record shop girl"‐‐

20:54.880 --> 20:56.423
[glass shatters]

20:57.049 --> 20:58.800
MAN: Oh, damn!

20:59.468 --> 21:02.054
‐ [loudly]
I don't want you

21:03.430 --> 21:06.850
to feel badly about the mistake
you just made.

21:06.850 --> 21:09.269
We're all just doing our best.

21:09.561 --> 21:11.772
We're all good people. Carry on.

21:12.356 --> 21:14.358
And then it occurred to me,

21:15.400 --> 21:16.693
because of you,

21:16.693 --> 21:21.156
that this piece isn't about... revenge.

21:21.657 --> 21:24.117
It's about karma, right?
ROB: Right.

21:24.117 --> 21:27.329
‐ My ex is given a framed $20 bill,

21:27.329 --> 21:29.498
a dagger through his rotten heart.

21:29.873 --> 21:32.501
I am given the bittersweet satisfaction

21:32.501 --> 21:35.003
of delivering the dagger.

21:35.546 --> 21:37.923
And the lovely girl from the record shop

21:38.507 --> 21:39.842
is given the prize.

21:40.884 --> 21:43.887
Everyone is given... what they deserve.

21:44.263 --> 21:45.556
‐ Right. Yes.

21:45.556 --> 21:48.016
Everyone, everyone gets what they deserve.

21:49.226 --> 21:51.854
‐ I mean, it's possible
that I'm, you know,

21:51.854 --> 21:55.607
reversing of the wheels of karmic balance,

21:55.607 --> 21:57.109
but, you know, this is art,

21:57.109 --> 21:59.903
and, I mean, a girl can try, no?

22:00.696 --> 22:01.738
‐ For sure.

22:01.738 --> 22:05.450
‐ So, a perfectly crisp
twenty dollar bill?

22:11.206 --> 22:12.374
‐ Right. Right.

22:12.374 --> 22:13.667
Yeah. For sure.
‐ Okay.

22:14.877 --> 22:16.003
Let's do this.

22:20.716 --> 22:22.968
‐ I don't, I don't know. I don't, mmm‐‐

22:23.343 --> 22:24.261
‐ What? No.

22:25.512 --> 22:26.638
She's joking. It's a‐‐

22:27.097 --> 22:28.182
Right?

22:28.974 --> 22:32.269
‐ No. Look, I don't want
to waste your time, and I, um‐‐

22:32.853 --> 22:34.730
I'm really‐‐ I don't wanna
fuck up your art,

22:34.730 --> 22:37.316
which I think is really very cool.

22:37.316 --> 22:38.233
Um‐‐

22:39.193 --> 22:42.529
I, I don't know, I don't really think
I'm qualified to decide

22:42.529 --> 22:45.240
who deserves to get what
they get or whatever.

22:45.240 --> 22:46.116
I just‐‐

22:46.116 --> 22:48.493
‐ Well, I, I respect
your integrity, my dear,

22:48.493 --> 22:52.497
but the lines in this case
are, are quite clear.

22:53.373 --> 22:55.709
My ex is a bad guy.

22:56.835 --> 22:58.045
‐ Yeah, I know, I know, I get that.

22:58.045 --> 23:00.547
I get that he's, um, a bad guy

23:00.547 --> 23:03.300
and a total misogynist, um,

23:03.300 --> 23:06.136
from what you've said, is what I, I can‐‐

23:06.762 --> 23:09.431
But I don't know,
he, he loves music, you know.

23:09.431 --> 23:11.058
And I love music, and...

23:13.060 --> 23:15.103
this is a little embarrassing
to say out loud, but, um...

23:16.396 --> 23:18.649
music has saved
my life, you know.

23:19.399 --> 23:20.400
So many times.

23:20.400 --> 23:22.110
And I don't know,

23:22.110 --> 23:23.862
I just, I think it should be
for everyone, you know.

23:23.862 --> 23:25.864
It should be for good people
and for shitty people

23:25.864 --> 23:27.950
and just for everybody,
you know, like, um,

23:28.575 --> 23:29.409
wi‐fi.

23:29.993 --> 23:31.787
Or... healthcare.

23:32.204 --> 23:35.082
Not here but, um, most places.

23:35.666 --> 23:37.543
Hopefully here one day, right? Um‐‐

23:38.418 --> 23:39.419
‐ Uhh!

23:41.713 --> 23:42.673
‐ So, yeah.

23:44.466 --> 23:45.759
‐ That's your decision?

23:48.720 --> 23:50.639
‐ If Simon and Cherise
ever found out about this,

23:50.639 --> 23:51.765
they'd have me beheaded.

23:53.392 --> 23:54.685
I kinda want to do it myself.

23:57.604 --> 23:59.189
Yeah, that's my decision.

24:01.441 --> 24:02.442
‐ Okay.

24:03.527 --> 24:05.863
‐ Hey, Noreen, can I use the John?

24:06.280 --> 24:07.531
‐ I don't know, can you?

24:09.741 --> 24:10.742
‐ Okay.

24:11.577 --> 24:13.871
‐ What the fuck, Rob?

24:16.498 --> 24:19.459
Why did I side with the bad guy?

24:20.294 --> 24:22.212
‐ Look, I don't, I'm not trying
to over‐step here.

24:24.339 --> 24:26.216
It seemed like you were thinking,

24:28.343 --> 24:30.387
if they can take away this guy's records,

24:31.597 --> 24:32.848
just 'cause he

24:33.932 --> 24:36.310
sucks, but made some bad decisions,

24:37.519 --> 24:38.979
then you're wondering,

24:38.979 --> 24:40.522
like, when are they coming for mine?

24:44.234 --> 24:46.486
[mimicking Noreen]
I don't want you to feel bad

24:46.486 --> 24:49.198
about the mistakes you've made, Rob!

24:50.616 --> 24:52.868
We are all doing our best.

24:52.868 --> 24:54.786
‐ Oh! Oh, my God.

25:01.752 --> 25:02.794
‐ All right.

25:03.712 --> 25:05.964
‐ Not to get all... something,

25:05.964 --> 25:09.801
but I wanted to say that
I had a really good time today.

25:09.801 --> 25:10.844
‐ Yeah.
‐ With you.

25:12.095 --> 25:14.056
I wasn't sure what it was gonna be like
hanging out again.

25:14.056 --> 25:17.100
I thought it was gonna be weird
and awkward because of the whole

25:18.227 --> 25:20.145
sex thing, um‐‐

25:20.854 --> 25:22.731
I just wanted to say
that it was really fun.

25:22.731 --> 25:24.024
That's all I wanted to say.
Jesus.

25:24.441 --> 25:25.609
[clears throat]

25:25.609 --> 25:27.069
‐ Yeah. Yeah, it was, wasn't it?

25:27.069 --> 25:27.986
‐ Yeah.

25:29.738 --> 25:30.781
‐ Oh, hey, hey.
‐ Yep?

25:30.781 --> 25:31.949
‐ Uh, just before

25:33.116 --> 25:34.910
before you jet, um,

25:35.702 --> 25:36.954
this might be a weird move.

25:36.954 --> 25:38.997
‐ Yeah?
‐ Um‐‐

25:40.207 --> 25:42.167
‐ [laughs]
That's a weird move, for sure.

25:42.167 --> 25:45.087
‐ No, this is a,
this is an actual weird move.

25:45.879 --> 25:47.506
[mimicking trumpeting]
[gasps]

25:49.174 --> 25:50.175
Check that out.

25:50.759 --> 25:51.760
‐ Oh, my God.

25:52.678 --> 25:53.971
What?
‐ Yeah.

25:54.596 --> 25:56.306
‐ What? What?
‐ I, I took it.

25:56.765 --> 25:59.059
‐ Wh‐‐
‐ Yeah, I pilfered that.

25:59.059 --> 26:01.186
‐ Holy shit! Holy shit!

26:01.186 --> 26:02.563
What?
‐ Yeah, yeah, yeah.

26:03.564 --> 26:05.190
Yeah.
‐ Oh, my God.

26:05.190 --> 26:08.151
Dude. Dude!

26:08.151 --> 26:10.279
‐ I just, I've never seen
anybody look at anything

26:10.279 --> 26:12.573
the way you looked at that record,
I felt like it was important to have it.

26:12.573 --> 26:14.867
‐ Oh, my God.
‐ I was like... boop.

26:15.868 --> 26:17.327
‐ Clyde. Clyde?

26:17.327 --> 26:18.161
‐ Yes.

26:18.161 --> 26:19.997
‐ I've wanted one of these
since the eighth grade.

26:20.956 --> 26:21.874
‐ Awesome.

26:25.502 --> 26:26.336
‐ Wow.

26:29.882 --> 26:31.216
Wow, um,

26:35.554 --> 26:36.346
thank you.

26:37.306 --> 26:38.182
‐ Yeah.

26:39.141 --> 26:40.100
‐ You stole this?

26:41.852 --> 26:42.895
‐ Um‐‐

26:43.854 --> 26:45.189
‐ I can't believe you stole something.

26:46.106 --> 26:47.566
I mean, you get your shirts pressed, man.

26:47.566 --> 26:49.526
‐ I mean, I, like, stole it, kinda.

26:50.027 --> 26:51.695
'Cause I left her the twenty.

26:53.906 --> 26:54.865
‐ Of course you did.

26:55.240 --> 26:56.491
‐ Just so everybody's happy.

26:56.491 --> 26:57.743
Everybody gets their piece.

26:57.743 --> 26:58.619
‐ Bad‐ass‐ish.

26:59.161 --> 27:00.954
‐ Yeah, like bad‐ass‐adjacent.

27:07.669 --> 27:08.670
Um‐‐

27:11.381 --> 27:12.549
‐ Well, uh‐‐

27:13.342 --> 27:14.551
What?

27:14.551 --> 27:16.094
‐ No, no, go ahead.
‐ Oh.

27:16.094 --> 27:16.970
No, nothing.

27:18.931 --> 27:20.307
Well, thank you.
‐ Yeah.

27:21.683 --> 27:22.935
‐ All right, I'll see you around.

27:24.561 --> 27:25.479
‐ Okay.

27:26.271 --> 27:27.564
Hey, Rob.

27:27.564 --> 27:28.899
‐ Yeah?
‐ Um,

27:28.899 --> 27:30.776
maybe I'll pop by the shop sometime.

27:31.068 --> 27:32.152
‐ Yeah. Sure. Whatever.

27:34.363 --> 27:35.239
‐ All right.

27:38.242 --> 27:40.035
What the fuck was that?
