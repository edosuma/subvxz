00:02.033 --> 00:04.700
Previously on
Witches of East End...
Dash, you killed a man.

00:04.733 --> 00:07.733
(grunting)
And I helped to cover it up.

00:07.766 --> 00:09.400
This man in your life‐‐

00:09.433 --> 00:12.233
you're keeping him
at arm's length.

00:12.266 --> 00:13.900
You've been hurt a lot.

00:13.933 --> 00:16.966
And Dad?
He's dead.

00:17.000 --> 00:19.000
Your friends killed our father?
FREDERICK:
They weren't my friends.

00:19.033 --> 00:20.800
And I've beaten myself up
every day since.

00:20.833 --> 00:25.066
I have never been able to read
one of your thoughts.

00:25.100 --> 00:26.166
Maybe that's a good thing.

00:26.200 --> 00:27.566
DASH:
Thank you, Freya.

00:27.600 --> 00:29.300
For what?
For leaving me.

00:29.333 --> 00:32.066
It was the best thing
that ever happened to me.

00:36.766 --> 00:39.166
(moaning)

00:41.233 --> 00:43.966
(giggling)

00:44.000 --> 00:46.733
Shh. Babe, my family are asleep.
You have to be quiet.

00:46.766 --> 00:49.166
Okay, shh.

00:55.733 --> 00:58.566
(groaning)

00:58.600 --> 00:59.333
Freddie?

00:59.366 --> 01:00.500
(groaning and wheezing)

01:00.533 --> 01:02.466
Freddie?
(grunts)

01:02.500 --> 01:04.666
Freddie?!
Freddie?!
What's going on?

01:06.400 --> 01:08.500
I think he's
having a seizure.

01:08.533 --> 01:10.200
Give me
some space.
I just want to help.

01:10.233 --> 01:12.633
Frederick.
(Freddie gasping and wheezing)

01:12.666 --> 01:15.066
Freddie.

01:15.100 --> 01:17.300
Curavi conreptio.
Curavi conreptio.

01:17.333 --> 01:19.033
(grunts)

01:19.066 --> 01:21.500
Curavi conreptio.

01:21.533 --> 01:23.200
Curavi conreptio...

01:23.233 --> 01:25.133
Curavi conreptio.

01:25.166 --> 01:26.333
(sighs)

01:31.000 --> 01:33.333
Mom?
Hmm?

01:38.233 --> 01:39.833
Freddie, are you okay?

01:39.866 --> 01:42.433
Yeah, babe, I'm...
I'm fine. I'm fine.

01:44.666 --> 01:49.166
Mom, I'd like you to meet
Caroline, my girlfriend.

01:54.366 --> 01:57.200
KILLIAN:
You think having too much sex
can actually be dangerous?

01:57.233 --> 01:58.800
Only one way to find out.

01:58.833 --> 02:00.300
(laughing):
Okay. Hold on.

02:00.333 --> 02:01.733
Let me at least
take a shower.

02:01.766 --> 02:04.500
Fine. Reject your wife.

02:04.533 --> 02:06.466
Go take a shower.
You smell like a pig.

02:06.500 --> 02:07.866
(sniffs)
A pig?
Mm‐hmm.

02:07.900 --> 02:09.233
Really?
Yes.

02:09.266 --> 02:11.300
You dare call me a pig?
Yes.

02:11.333 --> 02:13.700
(snorting)

02:13.733 --> 02:16.366
(giggling)
Okay, stop it!

02:16.400 --> 02:18.166
Not until you say
you love pigs.
(laughing):
No.

02:18.200 --> 02:19.900
Yes, say it! Say it.

02:23.933 --> 02:27.066
What's wrong, baby?

02:30.933 --> 02:32.733
You okay?

02:32.766 --> 02:35.933
Yeah... Yeah, I'm fine.

02:48.033 --> 02:50.400
Hey.
Hey.

02:50.433 --> 02:54.000
Did you know that Frederick's
been having seizures?

02:54.033 --> 02:57.400
What? He's‐he's been having
seizures?

02:57.433 --> 03:00.666
He told me that you saw him
have one three weeks ago.

03:00.700 --> 03:03.033
Okay. Yes.

03:03.066 --> 03:04.866
All right, yes.

03:04.900 --> 03:06.533
He made me promise

03:06.566 --> 03:08.466
not to tell you.
Okay, we've

03:08.500 --> 03:09.866
been trying
to cure this together...

03:09.900 --> 03:11.466
I don't care!

03:11.500 --> 03:13.633
You should
have told me.

03:13.666 --> 03:16.466
I can't believe that you would
keep this secret from me.

03:16.500 --> 03:18.900
Oh, as if you haven't
kept secrets from me.

03:20.066 --> 03:21.500
He's trying
to protect you from this.

03:21.533 --> 03:23.466
Can't you understand that?

03:23.500 --> 03:25.666
Oh, so this is strange‐‐ now
you're working with Frederick.

03:25.700 --> 03:27.300
I thought you didn't trust him.

03:27.333 --> 03:29.333
Well, it's possible

03:29.366 --> 03:32.300
that I might have been wrong
about Freddie.

03:32.333 --> 03:35.700
Well, Frederick had another
surprise for me last night,

03:35.733 --> 03:38.233
and, uh, she was naked.

03:38.266 --> 03:39.700
(laughing):
Oh, no.

03:39.733 --> 03:42.133
Poor Caroline.

03:42.166 --> 03:44.066
Wait‐‐ you know her?

03:44.100 --> 03:47.866
Yeah... yeah, you know that
she works at the university?

03:47.900 --> 03:49.900
He's been auditing
one of her classes.

03:49.933 --> 03:51.466
She teaches
environmental science.

03:51.500 --> 03:53.133
She's actually very smart.

03:53.166 --> 03:54.966
No, I didn't know that,

03:55.000 --> 03:57.133
because I didn't even know
that she even existed,

03:57.166 --> 03:59.200
because nobody ever
tells me anything.

03:59.233 --> 04:01.166
I'm sorry.
I've only met her a few times.

04:01.200 --> 04:02.666
You've already seen her naked.

04:02.700 --> 04:04.666
Oh, completely naked.

04:04.700 --> 04:09.033
Anyway, I invited her for
a relaxed dinner tonight.

04:09.066 --> 04:10.466
Hopefully clothed.

04:10.500 --> 04:11.866
(laughter)

04:11.900 --> 04:13.233
Would you like
to join us?

04:13.266 --> 04:14.733
Sure, yeah.

04:14.766 --> 04:16.900
I could use the distraction.

04:16.933 --> 04:20.966
Tommy has taken his daughter
on a camping trip.

04:21.000 --> 04:23.466
I've just been sitting
around here all yearny for him.

04:23.500 --> 04:25.533
You know that I actually slept
with his sweater

04:25.566 --> 04:28.033
on my pillow last night,
just so I could smell him?

04:28.066 --> 04:32.166
You're really in love.
Oh, bite your tongue, Joanna.
Love is the worst.

04:32.200 --> 04:34.500
What do you mean? It's the
best thing in the world.
No.

04:34.533 --> 04:36.566
It's not.

04:36.600 --> 04:38.733
Love always ends in pain.

04:38.766 --> 04:42.500
Someone either
leaves, or dies.

04:42.533 --> 04:45.333
I'm sorry.

04:45.366 --> 04:47.766
No, no, it's okay.

04:56.200 --> 04:58.200
(Ingrid gasps)

04:58.233 --> 05:00.900
(laughing):
Dash. Hi.

05:00.933 --> 05:02.466
What are you doing here?

05:02.500 --> 05:05.000
I just, you know, came in
to see if you were okay.

05:05.033 --> 05:07.566
Oh, I'm the worst.
I got your messages,

05:07.600 --> 05:09.666
and I‐I kept meaning
to call you back,

05:09.700 --> 05:11.500
but I‐I think
I've just been in hiding.

05:11.533 --> 05:14.466
Hiding from what?
Life, reality.

05:14.500 --> 05:16.133
Everything.
I just come here,

05:16.166 --> 05:17.566
shelve books, go home.

05:17.600 --> 05:19.000
That way no one gets hurt.

05:19.033 --> 05:21.400
Ingrid, listen,

05:21.433 --> 05:24.066
what happened with the
Mandragora wasn't your fault.

05:25.900 --> 05:28.133
Everyone keeps saying that.

05:28.166 --> 05:29.466
Yeah.

05:29.500 --> 05:30.900
You can't stay
in hiding forever.

05:30.933 --> 05:33.466
No. What you need‐‐

05:33.500 --> 05:35.133
you need a night out.

05:35.166 --> 05:36.866
What do you mean?

05:36.900 --> 05:38.133
Look, I'm on the board of the

05:38.166 --> 05:39.533
East End Coalition
for the Arts,

05:39.566 --> 05:41.333
so I have this thing tonight.

05:41.366 --> 05:42.700
It's... I don't know,
a little...

05:42.733 --> 05:44.333
a little drinking,
a little dancing...

05:44.366 --> 05:47.166
I think it'll be
a lot of fun, so...

05:47.200 --> 05:49.200
I don't know;
what do you say?

05:49.233 --> 05:51.700
Would... would you like
to come with me?

05:53.100 --> 05:55.666
As friends... of course.

05:55.700 --> 05:57.300
Of course.

05:57.333 --> 05:59.200
Yes, as friends.

05:59.233 --> 06:01.033
Okay. Great.

06:01.066 --> 06:02.800
So, I'll‐I'll meet you there
at 7:00?

06:02.833 --> 06:03.800
Yes.

06:03.833 --> 06:05.166
That sounds great, yeah.

06:05.200 --> 06:07.200
Perfect.
All right, I'll see you then.

06:07.233 --> 06:08.833
I'll see you there.
Okay... Okay.

06:08.866 --> 06:10.166
Okay, bye.

06:10.200 --> 06:11.333
Bye‐bye.

06:16.733 --> 06:17.700
That seizure was scary.

06:17.733 --> 06:19.733
You sure you're okay?

06:19.766 --> 06:23.133
The doctor ran some tests, but
he doesn't think it's serious.

06:23.166 --> 06:25.233
He just warned me
to reduce my stress.

06:25.266 --> 06:27.500
Maybe you can help me with
that after dinner tonight.

06:27.533 --> 06:29.033
I cannot have dinner
with your mother

06:29.066 --> 06:30.566
after I flashed her my boobs.

06:30.600 --> 06:32.666
It didn't faze her, I promise.
My mother is

06:32.700 --> 06:34.500
the most non‐judgmental person
you'll ever meet.

06:34.533 --> 06:36.566
She's seen it all.
Exactly.

06:36.600 --> 06:38.533
She saw it all.

06:38.566 --> 06:40.333
(laughs)
Come on.

06:40.366 --> 06:42.066
She's important to me,
and you're important to me.

06:42.100 --> 06:43.566
And so, it's important to me

06:43.600 --> 06:45.400
that the two of you get
to know each other.

06:45.433 --> 06:46.966
(sighs)

06:47.000 --> 06:48.600
Well, you're important
to me, too.

06:51.333 --> 06:52.300
I gotta go.

06:52.333 --> 06:54.000
I'm late for a class.

06:54.033 --> 06:56.400
I'll see you tonight?

06:56.433 --> 06:58.566
Yes, okay, fine, I'll have
dinner with your mother.

06:58.600 --> 07:00.900
I'll just have
to wear a burka or something.

07:00.933 --> 07:02.266
Bye.

07:06.000 --> 07:07.800
Hello, Frederick.

07:07.833 --> 07:09.033
Who the hell are you?

07:09.066 --> 07:11.200
Afferrentur dolor.

07:15.100 --> 07:17.500
What are you doing to me?

07:17.533 --> 07:19.933
Remora.

07:21.566 --> 07:23.333
I don't want to hurt you,
Frederick.

07:23.366 --> 07:26.133
I'm here to help you
complete your mission.

07:26.166 --> 07:27.866
We're going to work together

07:27.900 --> 07:29.833
to bring back the king.

07:32.333 --> 07:34.633
FREYA:
I don't know

07:34.666 --> 07:37.066
how you did this, but you
scored yourself an invite

07:37.100 --> 07:38.900
to the annual East
End Arts Coalition

07:38.933 --> 07:40.300
Black‐Tie Gala.
Oh.

07:40.333 --> 07:41.800
I did?
Yeah.

07:41.833 --> 07:43.733
Who's the featured
artist this year?

07:43.766 --> 07:46.200
I don't know.
Some guy named Seamus?

07:46.233 --> 07:52.233
Oh, no... no, not the so‐called
"conceptual, but gritty artist"

07:52.266 --> 07:55.533
whose paintings sell
for millions of dollars

07:55.566 --> 07:57.833
to rich assholes.

07:59.066 --> 08:00.466
He keeps his identity

08:00.500 --> 08:03.066
secret because, hey,

08:03.100 --> 08:04.333
he's mysterious,

08:04.366 --> 08:05.666
he's authentic.

08:05.700 --> 08:07.033
But, uh, what do I know?

08:07.066 --> 08:08.566
I'm just a lowly art teacher.

08:08.600 --> 08:10.833
WENDY:
I don't understand

08:10.866 --> 08:12.633
why I've been invited to this.

08:12.666 --> 08:14.333
I don't make millions
of dollars.

08:14.366 --> 08:15.900
We just have
to dress like we do.

08:15.933 --> 08:17.166
I'm sorry. We?

08:17.200 --> 08:18.566
Oh, I'm your plus one.

08:18.600 --> 08:20.200
Okay, this sucks

08:20.233 --> 08:21.733
on so many different levels.

08:21.766 --> 08:23.466
You know what?
I don't even know if I'm going.

08:23.500 --> 08:26.000
Come on, Wendy.
I need a night out.

08:26.033 --> 08:27.733
With cocktails
that I'm not serving

08:27.766 --> 08:29.633
to other people.

08:29.666 --> 08:32.800
Besides, I'm tired of moping
around, pining for Killian.

08:32.833 --> 08:35.466
Can we please do this?

08:35.500 --> 08:37.633
All right, I hear you, girl.

08:37.666 --> 08:39.366
But if this invitation

08:39.400 --> 08:42.700
is somehow a mistake
and we get booted at the door...

08:42.733 --> 08:44.700
Then we have a really fun story
to tell.

08:44.733 --> 08:46.833
That's true.

08:49.266 --> 08:51.466
Your, uh, grandfather
sent me, Frederick.

08:51.500 --> 08:54.066
He's been growing concerned
about you and your mission.

08:54.100 --> 08:55.700
Thought you might
need some help.

08:55.733 --> 08:57.200
That's impossible.

08:57.233 --> 08:59.233
I'm the only one
who can talk to him.

08:59.266 --> 09:00.866
I'm a telepath.

09:00.900 --> 09:03.733
And a loyal servant
to the king.

09:03.766 --> 09:07.166
I actually knew your parents,
a long time ago, back in Asgard.

09:07.200 --> 09:08.866
We were friends.

09:08.900 --> 09:11.033
How did you get
through the portal?
I've been here

09:11.066 --> 09:14.333
400 years, keeping an eye
on things for the king.

09:14.366 --> 09:15.966
I don't need your help.

09:16.000 --> 09:17.466
I've got it under control.

09:17.500 --> 09:18.800
I'm working on finding
a suitable host.

09:18.833 --> 09:20.200
How?

09:20.233 --> 09:21.833
You killed the Mandragora,
our only means

09:21.866 --> 09:23.966
of finding a host body
for the king's spirit.

09:24.000 --> 09:25.366
I didn't have a choice.
He was out of control‐‐

09:25.400 --> 09:26.866
murdering people
all over town.

09:26.900 --> 09:28.700
Well, to make an omelet,

09:28.733 --> 09:30.333
you have to kill some people.

09:30.366 --> 09:33.166
Look, I'm not accusing you
of anything.

09:33.200 --> 09:34.800
I really am here to help,

09:34.833 --> 09:36.666
but we don't have all the time
in the world.

09:36.700 --> 09:39.333
We have to find a host
as quickly as possible.

09:39.366 --> 09:42.166
Okay. How?

09:48.566 --> 09:50.000
Step one.

09:50.033 --> 09:51.966
What's that?

09:52.000 --> 09:54.033
You will prepare this potion,

09:54.066 --> 09:56.133
and then slip it
into your mother's drink.

09:56.166 --> 09:58.533
Why?

09:58.566 --> 10:00.366
Your mother is too powerful.

10:00.400 --> 10:02.000
Do you know she managed

10:02.033 --> 10:04.366
to keep this town cloaked
for over 100 years?

10:04.400 --> 10:06.866
I'd lost track
of her completely.

10:06.900 --> 10:08.966
She's dangerous...

10:09.000 --> 10:11.166
and smart.

10:11.200 --> 10:13.500
The king is concerned
she might find a way

10:13.533 --> 10:15.666
to interfere with his plans
for her daughters.

10:15.700 --> 10:17.833
You want your sisters
back with you

10:17.866 --> 10:19.366
in Asgard, don't you?

10:19.400 --> 10:21.333
Of course.

10:23.366 --> 10:26.400
You want me to kill her?
No.

10:26.433 --> 10:28.166
Don't be dramatic.
Nobody's asking that.

10:28.200 --> 10:29.700
The king would like her alive

10:29.733 --> 10:31.633
so he can deal with her
in person.

10:31.666 --> 10:33.833
The potion will merely
weaken her,

10:33.866 --> 10:37.966
considerably,
so she can't get in our way.

10:38.000 --> 10:40.166
And she won't
suspect a thing.

10:40.200 --> 10:42.600
It's another way
to ensure the plan succeeds.

10:45.833 --> 10:48.166
The king
wants this done tonight.

10:48.200 --> 10:49.966
Will that be a problem?

10:50.000 --> 10:52.866
Not at all.

11:06.165 --> 11:07.665
Well, how do I look?

11:07.698 --> 11:10.332
Like trouble.

11:10.365 --> 11:12.765
Calm down, Joanna.
It's just gonna be a night

11:12.798 --> 11:14.798
full of free booze
and microwaved canapés.

11:14.832 --> 11:17.998
Oh, please. An anonymous admirer
sent you that invitation

11:18.032 --> 11:20.465
with a private note instructing
you to meet him at the bar.

11:20.498 --> 11:21.798
How do you know that?

11:21.832 --> 11:23.465
Nobody tells me anything,
so I snooped.

11:23.498 --> 11:25.632
(gasps)
I know you're intrigued.

11:25.665 --> 11:26.732
I'm curious.

11:26.765 --> 11:28.298
Curiosity killed the cat.

11:28.332 --> 11:30.932
I'm just doing this for Freya.

11:30.965 --> 11:33.898
Things are going well
with you and Tommy.

11:33.932 --> 11:35.232
Don't screw it up.

11:35.265 --> 11:36.765
(scoffs)

11:43.332 --> 11:44.798
Whoa.

11:44.832 --> 11:47.165
(chuckles)
Did your closet explode?

11:47.198 --> 11:49.832
I have nothing to wear
to this thing tonight.

11:49.865 --> 11:51.632
You're going? To the gala?

11:51.665 --> 11:52.665
Yeah.

11:52.698 --> 11:53.965
Wait, are you?

11:53.998 --> 11:55.798
Dash invited me,

11:55.832 --> 11:57.165
and I've been feeling
really weird about it

11:57.198 --> 11:58.332
so I just wanted
to check with you

11:58.365 --> 11:59.832
and make sure that's all right.

11:59.865 --> 12:01.832
You're going on a date
with Dash?

12:01.865 --> 12:03.932
No, it's not a date.
We're just... friends.

12:03.965 --> 12:05.665
Well...

12:05.698 --> 12:07.498
yeah, I do mind,

12:07.532 --> 12:09.165
actually.
Wait, what?

12:09.198 --> 12:11.098
I don't want you to go.
You can't be serious.

12:11.132 --> 12:12.932
You came here to ask me
if I'm okay with it,

12:12.965 --> 12:15.165
and I'm not okay with it.
But Dash and I are just friends,

12:15.198 --> 12:17.232
and you aren't together
anymore, Freya.

12:17.265 --> 12:18.432
I don't trust him.

12:18.465 --> 12:20.298
Something's
up with him.

12:20.332 --> 12:21.832
He's changed.
Yeah. He has changed.

12:21.865 --> 12:24.598
He's like us now.
No, it's no like that.

12:24.632 --> 12:25.798
He said some really
awful things to me

12:25.832 --> 12:27.232
the last time I saw him.

12:27.265 --> 12:28.565
You mean when he had venom
in his brain,

12:28.598 --> 12:30.098
which made him
temporarily psychotic?

12:30.132 --> 12:31.432
He told me he had done things

12:31.465 --> 12:32.465
that would make me shudder.

12:32.498 --> 12:33.932
I believe him.

12:33.965 --> 12:35.798
Okay, that's crazy.

12:35.832 --> 12:37.465
You don't know what you're
talking about, Freya.

12:37.498 --> 12:38.498
What is that?

12:38.532 --> 12:41.298
Dash bought me a dress.

12:41.332 --> 12:43.098
Really. Is it couture?

12:43.132 --> 12:45.132
I don't know. Maybe.

12:45.165 --> 12:46.998
He did that for me
on our second date.

12:47.032 --> 12:49.998
I would say this is somewhat
more than friendly, Ingrid.

12:50.032 --> 12:52.832
Look, I have to go get ready.

12:52.865 --> 12:53.998
What, you're going?

12:54.032 --> 12:55.098
Yes, I am.

12:55.132 --> 12:56.298
Fine! Have fun!

12:56.332 --> 12:58.965
You, too.

12:58.998 --> 13:00.098
(sighs)

13:16.298 --> 13:17.498
(knocking)

13:22.132 --> 13:24.465
(knocking continues)
Whoa, whoa.

13:24.498 --> 13:25.665
Can't a guy get
a little privacy?

13:27.332 --> 13:29.265
Just... making sure you're okay.

13:29.298 --> 13:31.098
I'm great.

13:31.132 --> 13:32.832
I'll be out in a minute.

13:32.865 --> 13:35.298
Okay.

13:51.432 --> 13:53.932
♪ ♪

14:15.198 --> 14:16.965
I'm...

14:18.432 --> 14:20.598
You look incredible.

14:20.632 --> 14:23.598
Because of you.
And this dress.

14:23.632 --> 14:25.432
It actually fits
perfectly.

14:25.465 --> 14:27.398
How did you pick it out?

14:27.432 --> 14:29.765
Uh, buying women's clothes
is one of my specialties.

14:29.798 --> 14:32.765
(laughs)
Okay, that sounded
just wrong.

14:32.798 --> 14:33.965
It's too much, Dash.

14:33.998 --> 14:35.765
It's not nearly enough.

14:35.798 --> 14:38.665
After all you've done for me,
you deserve a perfect night.

14:38.698 --> 14:40.665
(chuckling)

14:45.832 --> 14:49.232
Okay, so Indian food, unless
the Thai place is open.

14:49.265 --> 14:50.965
But check
the sushi place first.

14:50.998 --> 14:52.465
You are very
high maintenance.

14:52.498 --> 14:53.998
High maintenance, high reward.

15:13.965 --> 15:15.665
Oh, man,
I got to make this quick.

15:15.698 --> 15:17.165
I don't know how much longer
I'll be lucid,

15:17.198 --> 15:18.765
but this Eva person,

15:18.798 --> 15:20.765
I think she has you
under some‐‐

15:20.798 --> 15:23.232
I mean us‐‐
under some sort of spell.

15:23.265 --> 15:25.065
She's using you, man.
She's trying to control you.

15:25.098 --> 15:27.465
But most important,
you don't love her.

15:27.498 --> 15:29.865
You love Freya.

15:33.665 --> 15:35.432
FREYA:
I can't believe she came here

15:35.465 --> 15:38.165
with him.
Well, you did say
they were friends.

15:38.198 --> 15:40.932
I don't trust him.
(chuckles)

15:40.965 --> 15:42.665
Okay, that did sound
a bit jealous.

15:42.698 --> 15:45.265
I am not jealous. Trust me.
I want nothing more

15:45.298 --> 15:47.898
than to be as far away
from Dash as possible.

15:47.932 --> 15:50.632
Well, he did help us
save Ingrid.

15:50.665 --> 15:51.898
He can't be all that bad.

15:51.932 --> 15:53.732
(grumbles)

15:53.765 --> 15:56.498
You know, there's something
about these paintings.

15:56.532 --> 15:58.498
Seem so familiar.

15:58.532 --> 16:00.665
I can't quite put my finger
on it, you know what I mean?

16:00.698 --> 16:03.332
Uh‐huh...

16:03.365 --> 16:05.432
It's like...

16:05.465 --> 16:07.665
I'm experiencing
déjà vu.

16:10.698 --> 16:14.065
Okay, Freya, please tell me
I'm not seeing what I'm seeing.

16:14.098 --> 16:16.465
FREYA: What?
That looks like me.

16:22.465 --> 16:24.465
My face is in this artwork.

16:24.498 --> 16:28.398
Look‐‐ my lips, my eye...

16:28.432 --> 16:29.832
Is that your necklace?

16:29.865 --> 16:30.832
(Wendy gasps)

16:30.865 --> 16:31.898
Yes.

16:31.932 --> 16:33.132
How is this happening?

16:33.165 --> 16:34.965
What are you doing
in these paintings?

16:34.998 --> 16:36.298
I don't know.

16:36.332 --> 16:37.765
Wendy.

16:37.798 --> 16:39.998
Ronan.

16:40.032 --> 16:41.465
(quiet laugh)

16:41.498 --> 16:44.165
I have dreamed about
this moment so many times,

16:44.198 --> 16:46.065
I might ask you to pinch me.

16:46.098 --> 16:48.065
How 'bout I punch you, instead?

16:48.098 --> 16:50.065
(chuckles)
Hi, I'm, uh...

16:50.098 --> 16:52.432
I'm Ronan, Wendy's husband.

16:52.465 --> 16:54.798
What?

17:05.572 --> 17:06.524
JOANNA:
Here you go. I put in

17:06.558 --> 17:08.924
an extra olive,
just the way you like it.

17:08.958 --> 17:10.924
Thanks, Mom.
Mrs. Beauchamp...

17:10.958 --> 17:12.924
Oh, please. Joanna.

17:12.958 --> 17:16.291
So, Wendy tells me you're
an environmental scientist.

17:19.691 --> 17:22.658
I'm so sorry
that you saw my breasts.

17:22.691 --> 17:24.991
(laughs)

17:25.024 --> 17:27.058
Um, I didn't see anything.

17:27.091 --> 17:28.924
Really?
I saw everything.

17:28.958 --> 17:30.758
But it's okay...

17:30.791 --> 17:33.024
(laughing):
Guys, come on...

17:33.058 --> 17:34.424
It's all clear sailing
from here.

17:34.458 --> 17:36.858
Thanks. Um...

17:36.891 --> 17:38.858
And I‐I should
tell you that...

17:38.891 --> 17:41.091
I‐I really do like
your son.

17:41.124 --> 17:42.591
Well, I'm glad.

17:42.624 --> 17:44.191
Maybe between you, me
and your breasts,

17:44.224 --> 17:46.491
we can persuade him
to stay in town for a while.

17:46.524 --> 17:48.024
(knocking on door)

17:51.458 --> 17:54.258
I'll be right back.

17:54.291 --> 17:57.391
I think I like your mom
more than I like you.

17:57.424 --> 17:58.658
Aw, thanks.

17:58.691 --> 18:01.758
(both chuckle)

18:03.691 --> 18:06.691
It looks like we have
one more for dinner.

18:12.724 --> 18:14.691
Hey, hey. Slow down.

18:14.724 --> 18:17.024
Where are you going?

18:17.058 --> 18:20.224
I told you back in the '90s
I never wanted to see you again.

18:20.258 --> 18:22.224
All right, well, can you talk
to me for five minutes?

18:22.258 --> 18:23.491
I am your husband.

18:23.524 --> 18:25.491
Ex‐husband! Ex!

18:25.524 --> 18:27.324
Semantics.
Oh.

18:27.358 --> 18:29.758
How can you show up like this
with all these paintings of me?

18:29.791 --> 18:31.024
Why would you do this to me?

18:31.058 --> 18:32.524
I did this
for you, Wendy.

18:32.558 --> 18:33.991
This is all for you.

18:34.024 --> 18:36.391
Look, just...
hear me out, please.

18:36.424 --> 18:38.024
Should I give you guys
a minute?
Yes.
No.

18:38.058 --> 18:39.258
I'm not gonna hear you out.
The last time

18:39.291 --> 18:41.158
I heard you out, I ended up

18:41.191 --> 18:42.858
in Tijuana in a hotel room,
in a wedding dress,

18:42.891 --> 18:45.524
while you escaped
out the bathroom window

18:45.558 --> 18:47.658
from the cops.
I came back.

18:47.691 --> 18:49.524
After I spelled the guards
and broke you out of jail.

18:49.558 --> 18:51.491
I really need to hear
the rest of that story.
No, that story is over.

18:51.524 --> 18:53.991
I have married and
divorced you three times.

18:54.024 --> 18:55.158
Never again.

18:55.191 --> 18:56.591
Babe, you say that every time.

18:56.624 --> 18:57.758
I mean it this time!

18:57.791 --> 18:59.524
Things are different
now, okay?

18:59.558 --> 19:00.824
I've gotten my act together.

19:00.858 --> 19:01.858
Exactly‐‐ your "act."

19:01.891 --> 19:03.424
Now you're "Seamus,"

19:03.458 --> 19:05.091
the gritty,
reclusive artist.
Would you... Shh.

19:05.124 --> 19:07.024
Or should I say
"scam artist"?

19:07.058 --> 19:09.258
It's not a scam, okay?
It's fun.

19:09.291 --> 19:11.358
I don't show my face
and people pay

19:11.391 --> 19:12.858
millions of dollars
for my work.

19:12.891 --> 19:14.691
Don't blow my cover.

19:14.724 --> 19:16.224
Look, Wendy,

19:16.258 --> 19:17.658
I've spent every day

19:17.691 --> 19:20.024
of the last 20 years
thinking about you.

19:20.058 --> 19:21.258
Bullshit.

19:21.291 --> 19:23.258
You only think about yourself.

19:23.291 --> 19:25.524
Look around, would you?

19:25.558 --> 19:26.724
I did these paintings
'cause it was

19:26.758 --> 19:28.258
the only way to keep
from going crazy.

19:28.291 --> 19:30.258
I wanted to get you
out of my head

19:30.291 --> 19:31.858
and onto the canvas.

19:31.891 --> 19:34.524
I wanted you here because
I need you to know exactly

19:34.558 --> 19:36.524
how I feel about you.

19:36.558 --> 19:40.524
This is my love letter
to you, Wendy.

19:40.558 --> 19:42.558
I want you back.

19:47.191 --> 19:49.758
I got to say, this is
a total surprise, Tarkoff.

19:49.791 --> 19:51.691
It's been so long.
Mmm.

19:51.724 --> 19:53.924
Feels like centuries.
(laughs)

19:53.958 --> 19:55.424
So what are you doing here?

19:55.458 --> 19:57.058
I heard about Victor.

19:57.091 --> 19:59.058
I came as soon
as I could.

19:59.091 --> 20:02.258
Well, it's really great
to see you again.

20:02.291 --> 20:03.724
I'm sorry for your loss.

20:03.758 --> 20:05.424
Victor was one of a kind.

20:05.458 --> 20:07.191
Yeah, he was.

20:08.424 --> 20:10.624
We all miss him very much.

20:12.591 --> 20:14.224
(timer beeping)

20:14.258 --> 20:15.258
Well, that's my cue.

20:15.291 --> 20:16.424
Dinner's ready.

20:16.458 --> 20:18.258
I'm gonna go set another place.

20:18.291 --> 20:21.058
Can I help you serve?
Sure.

20:25.391 --> 20:27.358
What are you doing here?

20:27.391 --> 20:28.591
Relax.

yeah, he may be an ordinary man,
but he brings me joy, not pain.

34:12.823 --> 34:15.456
Yeah, but, babe,
I‐I told you I've changed.

34:15.490 --> 34:17.823
I hope you have.

34:17.856 --> 34:20.323
For your sake.

34:20.356 --> 34:22.823
But for me,
it doesn't matter.

34:22.856 --> 34:27.756
I love him,
and it doesn't even hurt.

34:30.490 --> 34:32.823
I can't be with you.

34:32.856 --> 34:35.056
I'm sorry.

34:35.090 --> 34:36.990
Hey, wait, Wendy‐‐
Wendy, please.

34:37.023 --> 34:40.223
Please, please,
please, please...

34:40.256 --> 34:43.090
I need a lock of your hair.

34:43.123 --> 34:44.623
What?

34:44.656 --> 34:46.223
Preferably,
more like a bunch.

34:46.256 --> 34:48.056
Like a big bunch.

34:48.090 --> 34:49.890
What are you talking about?

34:49.923 --> 34:51.790
Well, I wasn't lying when I said

34:51.823 --> 34:54.123
there was a part of you
in every painting.

34:54.156 --> 34:58.156
See, every strand of hair
holds a piece of someone's soul.

34:58.190 --> 35:01.490
So I put a strand of your hair
in every painting that I do.

35:01.523 --> 35:03.090
See, your magic is inside them.

35:03.123 --> 35:06.156
That's why people love them!

35:06.190 --> 35:07.923
You kept my hair?

35:07.956 --> 35:09.823
Well, yeah, in case
I needed it some day.

35:09.856 --> 35:12.556
That is really creepy.
No, no, no, no, Wendy.

35:12.590 --> 35:15.556
Wendy, this is the best spell
I've ever done.

35:15.590 --> 35:18.090
These paintings sell
for millions.

35:18.123 --> 35:19.890
I don't have
to steal anymore.

35:19.923 --> 35:22.656
But I‐I ran out of your hair
about six months ago

35:22.690 --> 35:24.723
and I‐I need more.

35:24.756 --> 35:27.890
(laughs) I don't actually
know how to paint.

35:27.923 --> 35:31.923
(both laugh)

35:31.956 --> 35:33.956
(laughing)

35:33.990 --> 35:37.156
I don't ever want
to see you again.

35:38.690 --> 35:41.056
I have one life left,

35:41.090 --> 35:45.090
and I don't want to waste
another moment of it with you.

35:48.656 --> 35:51.023
So, is that a "no"
on the hair?

36:06.656 --> 36:09.123
Oh, God. Tarkoff!

36:09.156 --> 36:11.223
God, you scared me.

36:11.256 --> 36:13.390
Didn't hear you come in.

36:13.423 --> 36:15.090
Let me give you
a hand with those.
Ah, don't worry.

36:15.123 --> 36:16.656
I'm nearly done.

36:16.690 --> 36:20.090
I'm really glad
you came.
So am I.

36:20.123 --> 36:22.590
It's brought back so many
happy memories of Victor.

36:22.623 --> 36:25.923
You know, ever since he died...

36:25.956 --> 36:27.590
Oh. What?

36:27.623 --> 36:31.056
I don't know.
I mean...

36:31.090 --> 36:33.256
I just...

36:33.290 --> 36:34.656
(crying):
I miss him.

36:34.690 --> 36:36.756
(gently):
Come here. Come here.

36:36.790 --> 36:39.190
It's hard to mourn alone.

36:44.023 --> 36:46.423
Yeah...

36:46.456 --> 36:49.990
It is... (laughs)

36:50.023 --> 36:51.756
You know, I was supposed to fly
back to the coast tomorrow,

36:51.790 --> 36:53.790
but maybe I'll change my plans;
stay in town a while.

36:53.823 --> 36:55.456
What do you think about that?

36:55.490 --> 36:58.056
I think that would be lovely.

36:58.090 --> 37:00.323
Yeah.

37:16.987 --> 37:18.987
Are you okay?

37:20.287 --> 37:22.220
No, not really.

37:22.254 --> 37:24.020
You know who that was?

37:24.054 --> 37:25.587
Mm‐mm.

37:25.620 --> 37:28.687
It was William Hutton;
Kyle Hutton's father.

37:28.720 --> 37:30.420
Are you serious?
Yeah.

37:30.454 --> 37:33.854
Oh, my God.
I followed him out
there to talk to him,

37:33.887 --> 37:35.220
you know, see what
he knew, make sure

37:35.254 --> 37:37.120
no one suspects anything of us
in relation to Kyle.

37:37.154 --> 37:39.054
And?
No.

37:39.087 --> 37:40.720
No one suspects a
thing, thank God.

37:40.754 --> 37:42.920
Look, he's worried
about his son, but...

37:42.954 --> 37:45.020
as far as he's concerned,
Kyle is just missing.

37:45.054 --> 37:47.854
He had no idea
we even knew him.

37:47.887 --> 37:49.454
Poor guy.

37:49.487 --> 37:51.254
I mean, he must've been
under so much stress,

37:51.287 --> 37:54.487
he just...
he just collapsed.

37:56.087 --> 37:59.220
And I kept... I kept
thinking, this is...

37:59.254 --> 38:01.787
this is my chance
to save a life,

38:01.820 --> 38:05.287
you know,
even the score, but...

38:05.320 --> 38:07.087
I don't know, what's the point
of having all these powers

38:07.120 --> 38:08.754
if we can't use them
to save people?

38:08.787 --> 38:12.220
Dash, I know how bad you feel,
but it's not your fault.

38:12.254 --> 38:15.887
We've been telling each other
that a lot lately.

38:18.587 --> 38:20.987
You know, I even considered
bringing him back.

38:22.787 --> 38:25.620
And then I remembered what you
said about not playing God,

38:25.654 --> 38:27.420
and the consequences,
so I didn't.

38:27.454 --> 38:28.854
I'm sorry.

38:28.887 --> 38:31.220
No, Ingrid, don't be.

38:31.254 --> 38:34.720
You're the only one
who's really been there for me.

38:34.754 --> 38:36.854
Explaining things
to me, helping me.

38:36.887 --> 38:40.587
That's me‐‐ Ingrid the Helper.

38:40.620 --> 38:43.587
You know, ever since
I was a little kid,

38:43.620 --> 38:45.754
I was always
the responsible one.

38:45.787 --> 38:47.420
The good one.

38:47.454 --> 38:49.020
Going to college
and med school

38:49.054 --> 38:50.887
and being there for Mom.

38:50.920 --> 38:54.087
You were the anchor.

38:55.887 --> 38:58.420
Well... yeah...

38:58.454 --> 39:00.954
I guess I was.

39:29.787 --> 39:32.420
Sure you don't want me
to walk you home?

39:32.454 --> 39:34.287
I'm fine.

39:34.320 --> 39:36.854
Are you okay, though?

39:36.887 --> 39:40.287
I... You just... you seem...
No.

39:40.320 --> 39:42.754
I'm sorry. I'm sorry,
I'm just, uh...

39:42.787 --> 39:44.687
I have a lot
on my mind.

39:44.720 --> 39:46.854
Call me later?

39:46.887 --> 39:48.354
I will.

39:48.387 --> 39:50.587
Okay.

40:02.420 --> 40:05.420
I'm very...

40:05.454 --> 40:07.887
disappointed, Frederick.

40:09.120 --> 40:11.520
Why didn't you go
through with it?

40:11.554 --> 40:13.420
I thought we were
on the same team.

40:13.454 --> 40:15.454
Harming my mother would only
arouse suspicion.

40:15.487 --> 40:16.954
I won't do it.

40:16.987 --> 40:20.020
I was told by the king,
if you don't cooperate,

40:20.054 --> 40:22.620
I should do whatever it takes.

40:22.654 --> 40:23.754
Is that a threat?

40:23.787 --> 40:25.287
What do you think?

40:25.320 --> 40:27.620
I'm not scared of you.

40:27.654 --> 40:29.620
You can't kill me.

40:29.654 --> 40:33.920
Until a host body is found,
the king is right here.

40:33.954 --> 40:35.587
I'm the vessel,

40:35.620 --> 40:38.120
and you have no idea how
to carry the king's spirit

40:38.154 --> 40:39.787
without me.
You need me alive.

40:39.820 --> 40:41.187
Or I'll just cut
the king's spirit

40:41.220 --> 40:42.987
right out of your chest.

40:47.454 --> 40:49.054
Except you can't.

40:50.054 --> 40:51.587
Afferrentur dolor.

40:52.787 --> 40:54.620
I can still hurt you,

40:54.654 --> 40:57.554
so we better figure out
a way to work together.

40:57.587 --> 40:59.554
Remora.

40:59.587 --> 41:00.787
(coughing)

41:05.720 --> 41:08.820
I know a way we can do the work
of the Mandragora ourselves.

41:10.420 --> 41:12.854
It just means getting
our hands a little dirty.

41:12.887 --> 41:14.587
You better not be
messing with me.

41:14.620 --> 41:16.720
I'm not.

41:16.754 --> 41:19.720
But if you touch so much
as a hair on my mother's head,

41:19.754 --> 41:21.687
I'll slit my own throat.

41:21.720 --> 41:23.854
And we both know Grandfather

41:23.887 --> 41:25.720
can't continue his plan
without me.
