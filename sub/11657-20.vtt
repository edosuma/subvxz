00:41.600 --> 00:45.967
(mellow music playing)

00:59.000 --> 01:01.667
Let's go, Dorothy. I don't want to miss
my appointment at the beauty parlor.

01:01.734 --> 01:02.667
In a minute, Sophia.

01:02.734 --> 01:05.367
Dorothy's been trying to get through
to the box office for 20 minutes.

01:05.433 --> 01:09.667
I can't be late. The last time I was late,
Ronald gave me the broken hair dryer.

01:09.734 --> 01:11.934
I came out looking like Don King.

01:12.633 --> 01:16.166
Ma, please. All my life, I've wanted
to see Frank Sinatra in concert.

01:16.233 --> 01:18.700
I'm not getting off this phone
until I get tickets.

01:18.767 --> 01:20.066
What are you talking about?

01:20.133 --> 01:22.867
I took you and Gloria to see him
at the Paramount Theatre.

01:22.934 --> 01:24.633
I'll never forget it.

01:24.700 --> 01:27.166
From the second
he stepped out on the stage,

01:27.233 --> 01:29.266
I don't know... something happened.

01:29.333 --> 01:32.000
You fainted. That's what happened.

01:32.066 --> 01:36.800
I spent the rest of the evening
in the ladies' room, trying to revive you.

01:36.867 --> 01:40.333
Wasn't until a couple of years later
that I got another chance to see Sinatra.

01:40.400 --> 01:42.867
Stan bought tickets for my birthday.

01:42.934 --> 01:46.967
But two weeks before the concert,
he asked me for a divorce.

01:47.033 --> 01:50.266
I got the house and the kids.
He got the tickets.

01:50.333 --> 01:52.867
Don't think I didn't put up a fight!

01:53.934 --> 01:55.934
Oh, girls, I have terrible news.

01:56.000 --> 01:59.767
I failed my psychology exam.
I'm just beside myself.

01:59.834 --> 02:03.100
Oh, Blanche, look on the bright side.
It's just one test.

02:03.166 --> 02:06.333
Yeah, but this is my midterm.
I could fail the whole course.

02:06.400 --> 02:08.333
If I fail this course,
I won't get my degree,

02:08.400 --> 02:11.834
and if I don't get my degree, the museum
won't even consider me for that promotion.

02:11.900 --> 02:14.033
Oh, I guess there's no bright side.

02:15.834 --> 02:18.367
Honey, calm down.
You're gonna pass the course.

02:18.433 --> 02:21.700
It simply means that you're going to have
to buckle down and study a little harder.

02:21.767 --> 02:24.400
At least you're doing well
in your other two courses.

02:24.467 --> 02:27.367
But those are art courses.
They come easier to me.

02:27.433 --> 02:31.200
I've always had a great appreciation
for the arts and artists.

02:31.266 --> 02:34.667
And carpenters and mechanics
and delivery boys.

02:36.233 --> 02:38.734
Yes? Yes, yes, yes, I'm still here.

02:38.800 --> 02:41.433
Yeah. Yeah, I'm calling about
the Sinatra concert.

02:42.633 --> 02:44.600
It's what?

02:44.667 --> 02:47.700
What, you... you've kept me on hold
all this time

02:47.767 --> 02:50.467
to tell me that it is sold out?

02:50.533 --> 02:54.300
No, no, I will not have a nice day!

02:54.967 --> 02:58.700
Oh, darn! I was really
counting on that concert.

02:58.767 --> 03:00.834
-Now what'll we do?
-Don't worry.

03:00.900 --> 03:03.000
I'll make some calls.
I got connections.

03:03.066 --> 03:04.367
Ma, ma, I'll handle it.

03:04.433 --> 03:06.133
I'm going to call a couple of
ticket brokers.

03:06.200 --> 03:08.767
Fine, big shot. Handle it.
See how far you get.

03:09.767 --> 03:14.100
I just remembered, I know somebody
in show business who can help us.

03:14.633 --> 03:20.834
My best friend in St. Olaf has a nephew
who's a page at NBC in Hollywood.

03:21.567 --> 03:23.633
I'll write to her
and ask her to write to him.

03:23.700 --> 03:25.934
Honey, won't that take an awful long time?

03:26.000 --> 03:30.033
Oh, I don't mind.
I'm a very patient person.

03:30.100 --> 03:33.900
I once waited two whole weeks
for a sty to go away.

03:33.967 --> 03:35.433
Every night, I'd close my eyes

03:35.500 --> 03:38.533
and I'd picture it
getting smaller and smaller.

03:38.600 --> 03:41.000
And one morning,
I woke up and it was gone.

03:46.934 --> 03:48.066
Ma, you okay?

03:48.133 --> 03:51.300
I'm fine. I'm just trying
to make Rose go away.

03:53.300 --> 03:56.000
(mellow music playing)

03:57.467 --> 03:58.834
Whose theory states...

03:58.900 --> 04:01.100
"a young man becomes intimate
with his mother

04:01.166 --> 04:02.900
to get revenge on his father"?

04:02.967 --> 04:04.300
Well, I don't know who said it,

04:04.367 --> 04:06.767
but my second cousin Arlen did it.

04:09.700 --> 04:10.600
(laughs)

04:11.900 --> 04:14.467
I think we'd better try another question.

04:15.767 --> 04:17.533
I am exhausted!

04:17.600 --> 04:20.734
I went to at least a dozen ticket brokers
today.

04:20.800 --> 04:23.967
They all told me the only way I'm going
to get tickets is to go to a scalper.

04:24.033 --> 04:27.033
Oh, you can't buy from a scalper.
That's a crime.

04:27.100 --> 04:29.233
Well, so is eating grapes
at the supermarket,

04:29.300 --> 04:31.734
but you do that all the time.

04:32.233 --> 04:33.567
I have to test them.

04:33.633 --> 04:37.200
Rose, one is testing, 14 is brunch.

04:39.867 --> 04:41.333
Good Lord, I'm a criminal.

04:41.400 --> 04:44.700
Fine, as long as you already have
a record, I can count you in.

04:44.767 --> 04:48.667
Tomorrow, I am going to a scalper
and I'm going to buy four tickets.

04:48.734 --> 04:51.467
You'd better make that three.
My final exam is that night.

04:51.533 --> 04:53.000
Oh, honey, that's too bad.

04:53.066 --> 04:54.834
Oh, well, what difference does it make?

04:54.900 --> 04:57.000
My social life's gone
down the drain anyway.

04:57.066 --> 04:58.867
All I ever do is study.

04:58.934 --> 05:00.734
It cannot be good for you.

05:00.800 --> 05:05.400
It's unnatural, it's unhealthy,
it's unlike me.

05:06.900 --> 05:08.333
No wonder I can't concentrate.

05:08.400 --> 05:11.767
I need a break.
I need a change of scenery.

05:11.834 --> 05:14.400
I need to hit Wally's bar
for ladies' night.

05:15.066 --> 05:16.834
I'll see you all later.
Don't you girls wait up.

05:16.900 --> 05:18.200
Hold it, Blanche.

05:18.266 --> 05:21.066
I don't think you should go anywhere
till you finish your homework.

05:21.133 --> 05:22.533
I'll just be gone a few hours.

05:23.100 --> 05:25.500
You get right back here
and hit those books.

05:25.567 --> 05:26.967
(moans)

05:27.033 --> 05:29.900
If you want a diploma,
you have to apply yourself.

05:30.567 --> 05:34.800
Do you think Bob Hope got all
those degrees without studying?

05:39.367 --> 05:41.033
Rose, let me handle this.

05:41.100 --> 05:45.734
Listen, Blanche, nobody said
that going back to school would be easy.

05:45.800 --> 05:47.934
Easy? It's impossible.

05:48.000 --> 05:50.633
I cannot pass that course.
I just can't do it.

05:50.700 --> 05:52.433
Listen, honey,
If you're having such a problem,

05:52.500 --> 05:53.867
maybe you should talk to your teacher.

05:53.934 --> 05:56.333
Oh, I can't do that.
I'd be too embarrassed.

05:56.400 --> 05:58.166
But that's what teachers are there for.

05:58.233 --> 06:00.500
Oh, I know exactly how she feels.

06:00.567 --> 06:02.767
I used to be scared
of my teachers, too.

06:02.834 --> 06:03.867
Get out of here.

06:03.934 --> 06:05.567
No, it's true, it's true.

06:05.633 --> 06:08.567
Elementary school was a nightmare.

06:08.633 --> 06:10.567
I was afraid to talk in class.

06:10.633 --> 06:14.867
-Why?
-Well, I had a slight speech impediment.

06:14.934 --> 06:16.767
It's different for kids these days,
you know.

06:16.834 --> 06:19.100
They have Barbara Walters to look up to.

06:25.633 --> 06:28.834
Yeah, but in those days,
it really stood out, you know.

06:28.900 --> 06:31.000
Oh, I don't know,
it must have taken three months

06:31.066 --> 06:33.400
before I could muster up the courage,
you know,

06:33.467 --> 06:35.166
to talk to Mrs. Lenoff.

06:35.233 --> 06:37.967
And it turned out to be
the smartest thing I could have done,

06:38.033 --> 06:41.600
'cause not only did she help me, you know,
with the speech problem,

06:41.667 --> 06:44.734
she was the one who inspired me
to go into the teaching profession.

06:44.800 --> 06:47.333
You know what?
I think tomorrow after class

06:47.400 --> 06:48.900
I will talk to Professor Cooper.

06:48.967 --> 06:50.400
Good girl.

06:51.467 --> 06:53.667
Whatever happened to your teacher,
Mrs. Lenoff?

06:53.734 --> 06:57.934
Oh, gosh. Last I heard,
she retired from teaching,

06:58.000 --> 07:01.433
opened a bed and breakfast
someplace in Wode Island.

07:06.200 --> 07:07.533
Rhode Island.

07:11.900 --> 07:15.133
(quirky music playing)

07:28.967 --> 07:30.233
Professor Cooper?

07:30.300 --> 07:32.166
Yes? What can I do for you?

07:32.233 --> 07:34.233
Well, if I might have a minute
of your time.

07:34.300 --> 07:35.700
'Course, if now's not convenient, I can...

07:35.767 --> 07:38.734
No, no, please, please, sit.
I'm all ears.

07:39.333 --> 07:41.033
(chuckles) Don't sell yourself short.

07:41.100 --> 07:42.000
(laughs)

07:46.500 --> 07:48.800
I don't believe we've been
formally introduced.

07:48.867 --> 07:50.467
-I'm Blanche Deveraux.
-Yes, I know.

07:50.533 --> 07:52.300
-You do?
-Mm-hmm. Of course.

07:52.367 --> 07:53.467
Oh, I'm flattered.

07:53.533 --> 07:56.333
You're the only student
who failed my midterm exam.

07:57.400 --> 07:58.266
Oh.

07:59.200 --> 08:01.367
What was it you wanted to see me about?

08:01.433 --> 08:03.600
Well, Professor Cooper,
I suppose you are aware

08:03.667 --> 08:06.033
that I'm having the teensiest
bit of trouble in your course,

08:06.100 --> 08:09.533
and to be frank, passing this course
is very important to me.

08:09.600 --> 08:12.633
So, I was wondering if maybe
you could give me a little help.

08:12.700 --> 08:17.033
Oh, I see. Well, Blanche,
considering that you flunked the midterm,

08:17.100 --> 08:20.300
you'll need an "A" on the final exam
to even pass my class,

08:20.367 --> 08:22.934
and the odds on that seem pretty slim.

08:23.000 --> 08:25.633
But you see, I have to have these credits
to get my degree.

08:26.333 --> 08:31.233
Well, it's going to take a lot of
hard work on your part.

08:31.300 --> 08:32.834
You mean, like extra credit?

08:32.900 --> 08:34.200
Well, you could say that.

08:34.266 --> 08:35.467
Oh, well, that's fine.

08:35.533 --> 08:38.200
I'm ready, willing, and able.
I'll do whatever I have to.

08:38.266 --> 08:40.667
Oh, I like your attitude, Blanche.

08:42.133 --> 08:46.767
(clears throat)
This is my home phone number.

08:46.834 --> 08:50.567
If you really want that degree,
you'll use it.

08:50.633 --> 08:51.767
You catch my drift?

08:51.834 --> 08:53.433
Oh.

08:55.834 --> 08:57.533
Oh.

09:01.834 --> 09:04.000
(serene music playing)

09:05.667 --> 09:06.934
Here we are, Sophia.

09:07.000 --> 09:10.867
The perfect after-dinner treat.
A nice dish of jell-o.

09:10.934 --> 09:12.133
I hate jell-o.

09:13.967 --> 09:16.166
If God wanted peaches suspended in midair,

09:16.233 --> 09:17.734
he would have filled them with helium.

09:22.900 --> 09:25.200
-What?
-Beat it, Rose. I'm busy.

09:26.000 --> 09:27.000
What are you doing?

09:27.066 --> 09:29.533
It's Tuesday night.
I'm cleaning out my purse.

09:29.600 --> 09:30.467
(chuckles)

09:31.200 --> 09:33.166
Did all that stuff come out of your purse?

09:33.233 --> 09:36.100
No, I was also cleaning out my ears.

09:36.166 --> 09:38.800
That's where the feenamint
and the rain bonnet came from.

09:41.400 --> 09:43.767
Sophia, why are you
in such a bad mood?

09:43.834 --> 09:46.433
Forgive me, Rose,
but I haven't had sex in 15 years,

09:46.500 --> 09:48.367
and it's starting to get on my nerves.

09:56.200 --> 09:57.834
So, big shot, did you get the tickets?

09:57.900 --> 09:59.633
Can't you say hello first?

09:59.700 --> 10:02.333
Hello, big shot.
Did you get the tickets?

10:02.900 --> 10:05.900
Look, ma, don't start with me.
I've had a very rough day.

10:05.967 --> 10:10.667
The only scalper I could find
had funny things moving in his hair,

10:10.734 --> 10:12.934
and he wanted to bargain in a dark alley.

10:13.000 --> 10:15.467
-So, what seats did you get?
-I didn't get any tickets.

10:15.533 --> 10:17.300
I didn't think it was exactly safe.

10:17.367 --> 10:19.400
I can't believe you were such a baby.

10:19.467 --> 10:22.233
In Sicily, we did all our bargaining
in dark alleys.

10:22.300 --> 10:24.333
How do you think I ended up
with your father?

10:25.767 --> 10:27.800
Look, if the tickets are that hard to get,

10:27.867 --> 10:29.433
maybe we just weren't meant to go.

10:29.500 --> 10:32.667
Maybe you weren't, Rose,
but two weeks from now,

10:32.734 --> 10:36.433
I intend to be sitting in front
of old blue eyes himself,

10:36.500 --> 10:40.467
live, in-person,
middle-aged spread and all.

10:40.533 --> 10:42.734
Dorothy, you can take off
a few pounds by then

10:42.800 --> 10:44.066
if you put your mind to it.

10:49.800 --> 10:52.500
Oh, girls, I am devastated,
just devastated.

10:52.567 --> 10:53.867
Honey, what happened?

10:53.934 --> 10:56.767
I asked my teacher for help,
like you all told me to.

10:56.834 --> 11:00.066
He said the only way I would get an "A"
on his final is if I sleep with him.

11:00.133 --> 11:03.367
-No!
-Oh, yes. I just don't know what to do.

11:03.433 --> 11:04.633
Get it in writing.

11:11.300 --> 11:14.567
Blanche, that is terrible.
I hope you told him off.

11:14.633 --> 11:17.400
Well, first, I was so stunned,
I didn't know what to say.

11:17.467 --> 11:20.934
And then I marched back up to his desk
and I looked him straight in the eye,

11:21.000 --> 11:23.100
and I said, "I'll think it over."

11:23.166 --> 11:25.500
Blanche, there is nothing to think over.

11:25.567 --> 11:28.066
What he did is sexual harassment.

11:28.133 --> 11:29.567
He cannot get away with that.

11:29.633 --> 11:32.233
Well, I don't know if I can
pass this course on my own.

11:32.300 --> 11:35.000
Oh, Blanche, believe me,
in the long run,

11:35.066 --> 11:38.800
you'll be so much happier if you use
your brains instead of your body.

11:38.867 --> 11:40.900
I don't know if I can.

11:41.000 --> 11:44.000
When I was little, I was always
overshadowed by my sisters.

11:44.066 --> 11:47.033
They were all smarter
and more talented than I was.

11:47.100 --> 11:50.633
Then when I was 16,
I discovered I had a talent, too,

11:50.700 --> 11:52.333
the talent to drive men crazy

11:52.400 --> 11:55.266
with a body that many said
should have come with a warning label.

11:56.934 --> 11:58.400
Blanche, please.

11:58.467 --> 12:01.600
After a while, I learned that I could
use my looks to my advantage,

12:01.667 --> 12:04.166
so I did... regularly.

12:05.400 --> 12:08.233
I've done it for so long now,
I don't know if I can get by without it.

12:08.300 --> 12:10.300
Well, maybe this is a good time to start.

12:10.367 --> 12:11.800
Rose is right.

12:11.867 --> 12:14.400
Listen, you're going to get an "A"
in that class.

12:14.467 --> 12:15.800
We're going to help you do it.

12:15.867 --> 12:19.433
As far as that professor is concerned,
you should report him immediately.

12:19.500 --> 12:21.934
-You think I should?
-Absolutely.

12:22.000 --> 12:23.867
You know, when I first started teaching,

12:23.934 --> 12:27.633
the school principal pulled
exactly the same thing on me.

12:27.700 --> 12:30.667
-What did you do?
-I reported him to the board of education.

12:30.734 --> 12:33.400
They investigated,
and he was forced to resign.

12:34.266 --> 12:35.667
'Course, much later, I found out

12:35.734 --> 12:38.934
that I was not the only person
he had harassed.

12:39.800 --> 12:42.533
I was, however,
the only person he harassed

12:42.600 --> 12:45.567
while he was wearing
a corset and high heels.

12:50.767 --> 12:53.266
Well, at any rate, I spoke out,

12:53.333 --> 12:55.533
and because I did,
a lot of other women

12:55.600 --> 12:57.300
didn't have to go through the same thing.

12:57.367 --> 12:59.767
You know, Dorothy, you're right.
I have made up my mind.

12:59.834 --> 13:01.633
I'm going to see the dean
about Professor Cooper.

13:01.700 --> 13:03.600
Very wise decision.

13:03.667 --> 13:06.767
Nils Felander attempted
to harass me repeatedly.

13:07.367 --> 13:09.100
What do you mean, he attempted to?

13:09.166 --> 13:12.767
He worked at Lars Erikson's
drugstore and tackle shop.

13:12.834 --> 13:15.000
He was a soda jerk.

13:15.066 --> 13:17.734
Now that I think about it,
he was the town jerk.

13:18.633 --> 13:21.834
Every Saturday afternoon,
I'd go in and have a sundae.

13:21.900 --> 13:26.600
Well, Nils would arrange
the ice cream scoops in an obscene way.

13:35.066 --> 13:36.333
I could never prove it,

13:36.400 --> 13:40.767
because by the time I would take it home
to show my father, the...

13:46.700 --> 13:47.467
...the evidence had...

13:47.533 --> 13:50.200
-(both) Melted.
-(Rose) ...melted. Yes.

13:52.333 --> 13:58.533
To this day, every time I pass an ice
cream parlor or a tackle shop, I blush.

14:00.000 --> 14:02.333
(somber music playing)

14:03.633 --> 14:06.900
Look, Coach, I want Leon off the team.

14:06.967 --> 14:10.367
I don't care if he is 6'11"
and weighs 300 pounds.

14:10.433 --> 14:13.800
The... the boy can't spell his own name
unless he copies it off his jersey.

14:15.300 --> 14:18.133
Well, no, I'm not gonna tell him.
You tell him. You're the coach.

14:18.200 --> 14:19.133
(knock on door)

14:20.000 --> 14:20.834
Dean Tucker?

14:20.900 --> 14:24.100
Come in, come in.
Look, we'll talk about it later.

14:25.467 --> 14:28.533
Oh! Oh, boy.
Problems, problems, problems.

14:28.600 --> 14:30.600
(sniffles) My mother wanted me
to be a priest,

14:30.667 --> 14:34.834
but, no, I had to pursue the flashy world
of academics. (sniffs)

14:34.900 --> 14:37.433
-Oh, I'm... sit down, sit down.
-Thank you.

14:37.500 --> 14:39.033
Dean Tucker, my name is Blanche Deveraux,

14:39.100 --> 14:42.100
and I have something extremely important
to discuss with you.

14:42.166 --> 14:44.767
Could this... could this wait
till next week?

14:44.834 --> 14:47.567
I... I've only been Dean here
for a couple of days.

14:47.633 --> 14:50.467
I haven't got a secretary,
I... I can't get my parking validated.

14:50.533 --> 14:52.834
I don't even know where the restroom is.

14:52.900 --> 14:55.300
I was sexually harassed
by Professor Cooper.

14:56.467 --> 14:58.367
Oh, don't do this to me.

15:02.467 --> 15:03.633
Please, I beg you.

15:03.700 --> 15:06.567
Look... (stammering) We'll look into this
first thing Monday morning.

15:06.633 --> 15:08.000
It can't wait.

15:08.500 --> 15:10.700
You're right.
We'll do something immediately.

15:10.767 --> 15:13.400
We'll, uh, we'll fill out a form.

15:13.467 --> 15:16.266
There must be one
in here somewhere.

15:16.333 --> 15:21.166
Okay, sexual discrimination,
sexual education,

15:21.233 --> 15:22.867
sexual harassment.

15:23.900 --> 15:27.100
Okay, I'm going to have to ask you
a few questions.

15:28.934 --> 15:31.033
Well, Lord, I can't ask you this.

15:33.834 --> 15:36.166
I can't even ask my own wife this.

15:37.200 --> 15:38.500
I'd like to.

15:39.700 --> 15:42.266
Dean Tucker, what happened to me
was really quite simple.

15:42.333 --> 15:44.700
I'm not doing very well
in Professor Cooper's class,

15:44.767 --> 15:46.467
so he offered to give me an "A"

15:46.533 --> 15:48.700
if... if... if I would...

15:49.633 --> 15:50.900
Do number five?

15:53.533 --> 15:56.233
Actually, number 5, 6, and 7b.

15:58.834 --> 16:00.600
Why, that's terrible!

16:00.667 --> 16:02.600
(stammering) Were there any witnesses?

16:02.667 --> 16:04.800
-No.
-Oh. Oh.

16:04.867 --> 16:06.900
Well, that complicates things.

16:06.967 --> 16:08.367
Why, don't you believe me?

16:08.433 --> 16:10.400
It's not a question of
whether or not I believe you.

16:10.467 --> 16:13.633
It's just without substantial evidence,
it's just your word against his,

16:13.700 --> 16:15.667
and a man's career is at stake!

16:15.734 --> 16:18.600
Well, so is mine,
not to mention my dignity.

16:18.667 --> 16:20.834
I'm sorry. Look, I really am.
I'd like to help you.

16:20.900 --> 16:22.667
Unfortunately,
there's nothing I can do.

16:22.734 --> 16:24.100
But that's not fair!

16:24.166 --> 16:26.433
Miss Deveraux, life is not fair.

16:26.500 --> 16:29.333
I should know.
I'm 43 years old, and, until today,

16:29.400 --> 16:31.367
I never even heard of 7b.

16:35.600 --> 16:38.433
Well, I've known about it for some time,

16:38.500 --> 16:41.500
and as far as I'm concerned,
you can go do it to yourself.

16:43.433 --> 16:46.000
(serene music playing)

16:49.834 --> 16:51.166
Oh, hello, Rose.

16:51.233 --> 16:54.000
Blanche, you won't believe
what happened to me today.

16:54.066 --> 16:55.233
It was so exciting.

16:55.300 --> 16:57.967
I've been waiting for somebody to come
home so long I thought I was gonna burst.

16:58.033 --> 17:00.633
Well, you won't believe what happened
to me today in the dean's office.

17:00.700 --> 17:04.567
I was driving down Biscayne Boulevard,
listening to WREQ, the big band station.

17:04.633 --> 17:07.700
I usually listen to WXDC, all talk radio,

17:07.767 --> 17:11.600
but this morning,
a little voice told me to turn the dial,

17:11.667 --> 17:15.200
so I did, and I tuned in
right in the middle of this contest.

17:15.266 --> 17:17.667
They were looking for the 12th caller.

17:17.734 --> 17:20.667
Well, 12 has always been
my lucky number,

17:20.734 --> 17:22.967
so I pulled over
and I got my change ready...

17:23.033 --> 17:26.200
I always keep two dimes in the crook
of the door handle for emergencies...

17:26.266 --> 17:30.000
and by the time I got through,
I was the 12th caller.

17:30.066 --> 17:33.834
I won four tickets
to the Frank Sinatra concert!

17:34.734 --> 17:37.734
Rose Nylund,
you get your bohonkus back in here

17:37.800 --> 17:39.633
and listen to what I have to say.

17:39.700 --> 17:42.800
Oh, Blanche, I'm sorry.
What were you trying to tell me?

17:42.867 --> 17:44.667
Well, Rose, I just don't know
what I'm going to do.

17:44.734 --> 17:47.600
Three tickets to old blue eyes.

17:47.667 --> 17:49.100
It's finally going to happen.

17:49.166 --> 17:51.367
-But, Dorothy...
-Rose, please.

17:52.367 --> 17:55.166
I went down to the auditorium today
and out front,

17:55.233 --> 17:57.633
I saw a kid scalping tickets
to this woman.

17:57.700 --> 17:59.467
So I figured this is my last chance.

17:59.533 --> 18:01.300
I raced over, took her aside,

18:01.367 --> 18:03.934
explained to her how much
I'd always wanted to see Sinatra.

18:04.000 --> 18:07.734
And guess what.
She let me buy the tickets!

18:07.800 --> 18:10.767
It was that easy, just 'cause you said
how much you wanted to see Frank Sinatra?

18:10.834 --> 18:13.233
Yeah, that and that I only had
three weeks to live.

18:17.667 --> 18:20.633
-Dorothy...
-These are desperate times, Rose.

18:20.700 --> 18:23.300
Boy, I'll say. Today,
when I went to the dean's office--

18:23.367 --> 18:25.934
I got tickets, too.
This is such a coincidence.

18:26.000 --> 18:27.433
I was driving down
Biscayne Boulevard...

18:27.500 --> 18:31.734
No! No, no, no, please.
I cannot bear that again.

18:31.800 --> 18:35.066
She was listening to her car radio...
big band, not all talk.

18:35.133 --> 18:36.133
There was a contest.

18:36.200 --> 18:37.767
Something about a little voice,
a lucky number

18:37.834 --> 18:38.767
and a dime in a door handle.

18:38.834 --> 18:40.400
Then bim, bam, boom,
she won the tickets.

18:43.967 --> 18:45.400
Take a lesson, Rose.

18:46.800 --> 18:48.367
That's how you tell a story.

18:54.166 --> 18:56.967
Blanche, here we've been
running on about the concert,

18:57.033 --> 18:59.867
and you haven't even had a chance
to tell your story.

18:59.934 --> 19:01.000
Go ahead.

19:01.066 --> 19:03.700
Never mind. I don't feel like it anymore.

19:03.767 --> 19:06.367
Honey, come on, we're sorry.
We're listening now.

19:06.433 --> 19:07.900
You have our complete attention.

19:09.166 --> 19:10.767
All right.

19:10.834 --> 19:12.800
I went to see Dean Tucker today.

19:12.867 --> 19:17.533
So, big talker, did you get your mitts
on any tickets yet?

19:17.600 --> 19:19.767
(scoffs) As a matter of fact, I did.

19:19.834 --> 19:22.533
Three tickets, rear orchestra.

19:23.000 --> 19:25.567
Three tickets, third row center.

19:27.467 --> 19:29.433
Ma, how in the world did you get these?

19:29.500 --> 19:32.467
Easy. I called Frank.
I told you I had connections.

19:34.133 --> 19:36.367
You know Frank Sinatra?

19:36.433 --> 19:38.266
No, Frank Caravicci...

19:39.367 --> 19:41.033
from the fish market.

19:41.100 --> 19:43.600
He's always been good to me.
Never a bad piece of cod.

19:44.567 --> 19:46.667
-He knows Frank.
-Sinatra?

19:46.734 --> 19:50.800
No, Frank Tortoni, the dry cleaner,

19:50.867 --> 19:52.433
Tina's third cousin once removed.

19:52.500 --> 19:53.600
Tina Tortoni?

19:53.667 --> 19:55.500
Tina Sinatra!

20:01.600 --> 20:04.567
10 tickets. What are we gonna do
with ten whole tickets?

20:04.633 --> 20:07.333
I got it, I got it. We'll go
and scalp them in front of the theater.

20:07.400 --> 20:09.233
-(gasps)
-Oh, come on, Rose.

20:09.300 --> 20:12.700
After what we went through to get them,
the least we can do is break even.

20:12.767 --> 20:15.600
Now, believe me, whoever gets
these tickets is gonna be very grateful.

20:15.667 --> 20:16.533
Now, what do you say?

20:16.600 --> 20:18.967
Oh, who cares what she has to say?

20:19.533 --> 20:21.100
I have been trying for five minutes

20:21.166 --> 20:23.066
to tell you about my meeting
with Dean Tucker,

20:23.133 --> 20:25.800
and all you two can do is go on
about your silly concert.

20:25.867 --> 20:28.333
Oh, Blanche, I'm sorry.
What can we do for you?

20:28.400 --> 20:30.734
Nothing. I've decided
I have to do it myself.

20:30.800 --> 20:32.300
Since the dean was no help whatever,

20:32.367 --> 20:35.100
I've decided the only one
who can help me is me.

20:35.166 --> 20:37.967
Oh, I'm going to show that
Professor Cooper something.

20:38.033 --> 20:41.033
Now if you'll excuse me, ladies,
I have some tall studying to do.

20:41.934 --> 20:44.934
Only first I think,
as a reward for working so hard,

20:45.000 --> 20:47.166
I'll make myself an ice cream sundae.

20:48.033 --> 20:50.734
Uh, Rose, I suggest you leave the room.

20:50.800 --> 20:53.633
I may get a little crazy
with the chopped nuts.

21:02.600 --> 21:05.166
(somber music playing)

21:09.633 --> 21:10.800
Pencils down.

21:10.867 --> 21:11.600
(sighs)

21:12.633 --> 21:14.033
Well, where is everybody?

21:14.100 --> 21:16.700
Just you and me, Blanche.

21:17.200 --> 21:20.800
Well, looks like we're finally
at the crossroads.

21:20.867 --> 21:21.967
What ever do you mean?

21:22.033 --> 21:25.500
I mean, I know you've been
having trouble with this course,

21:25.567 --> 21:27.166
and I'd hate to see you
have to repeat it.

21:28.800 --> 21:30.333
You know, Professor Cooper,

21:30.400 --> 21:32.200
I've been thinking about what you said,

21:32.266 --> 21:35.133
and I have no intention
of repeating this course.

21:35.200 --> 21:38.200
Good. I'm glad you decided
to take me up on my offer.

21:38.266 --> 21:42.000
Oh, I'm declining your offer,
but I do want to thank you.

21:42.467 --> 21:44.000
-For what?
-Well, thanks to you,

21:44.066 --> 21:45.900
I studied all day and all night.

21:45.967 --> 21:47.266
Whenever I felt like giving up,

21:47.333 --> 21:49.700
I would just think about
what kind of man you really are,

21:49.767 --> 21:51.367
and I'd study even harder.

21:51.433 --> 21:52.633
In fact, you made me so mad,

21:52.700 --> 21:55.300
I decided to get an "A" on this test
come hell or high water,

21:55.367 --> 21:57.033
and I think I did.

21:57.967 --> 22:00.633
I, sir, am a lady.

22:00.700 --> 22:02.533
Maybe not the smartest lady in the world,

22:02.600 --> 22:04.767
but I do know that my self-respect
is more important

22:04.834 --> 22:06.467
than passing your damn course.

22:06.533 --> 22:09.567
So you, sir, can kiss my "A".

22:15.367 --> 22:17.467
(somber music playing)

22:20.300 --> 22:22.567
Oh, thank goodness you're...
I have been worried sick!

22:22.633 --> 22:24.600
Do you realize it's almost 2
in the morning?

22:24.667 --> 22:26.433
I was about to call the police!

22:26.500 --> 22:29.000
You should have. That's who we were with.

22:29.066 --> 22:30.767
What? What happened?

22:30.834 --> 22:32.667
Look, I don't want to talk about it.

22:32.734 --> 22:35.667
Oh, well, all right, but somebody tell me
before I die of suspense.

22:35.734 --> 22:39.166
My brilliant daughter scalped the tickets
to an undercover policeman.

22:40.567 --> 22:42.100
Ma, get off my back, huh?

22:42.166 --> 22:44.500
You're lucky I was with you.
You'd still be in the slammer

22:44.567 --> 22:46.100
if I hadn't faked that heart attack.

22:47.500 --> 22:50.166
My life will be ruined
if this ever gets home to St. Olaf.

22:50.233 --> 22:52.033
What'll they do, Rose?

22:52.100 --> 22:54.467
Revoke your ice fishing license?

22:56.000 --> 22:57.934
Take back your helmet with the horns?

22:59.400 --> 23:01.033
I mean, I'm the injured party.

23:01.100 --> 23:04.800
Obviously, I am destined
to never see Frank Sinatra face to face.

23:05.433 --> 23:07.567
They're called longenhodden.

23:14.467 --> 23:17.033
What is called longenhodden?

23:18.133 --> 23:20.467
The helmet with the horns.

23:21.166 --> 23:23.367
-Why, for two...
-Wait, wait.

23:23.433 --> 23:24.233
Girls!

23:24.300 --> 23:27.166
Not one soul has asked me about my test.

23:27.233 --> 23:30.300
Oh, Blanche, we forgot.
How did it go?

23:30.367 --> 23:33.133
Well, I think I passed with flying colors.

23:33.200 --> 23:35.934
But best of all, I told off
that nasty old professor.

23:36.000 --> 23:39.133
Honey, congratulations.
You're going to be a college graduate.

23:39.200 --> 23:40.800
Oh, we're so proud of you.

23:40.867 --> 23:43.200
Well, thank you, but I couldn't have
done it without you girls.

23:43.266 --> 23:45.600
Oh, now you can get that promotion
at the museum.

23:45.667 --> 23:48.767
Oh, no, didn't I tell you?
That position was filled.

23:48.834 --> 23:50.133
Oh, you're kidding.

23:50.200 --> 23:52.700
No, the museum director gave it
to Sally Folgeson.

23:52.767 --> 23:56.433
The money I spent on tuition,
she spent on a tummy tuck and a butt lift.

23:59.500 --> 24:01.000
Blanche, I hope you're not discouraged.

24:01.066 --> 24:03.300
Oh, not one bit.
My time will come.

24:03.367 --> 24:04.967
One day, her butt will turn to mush,

24:05.033 --> 24:06.734
but I'll always have my degree.

24:09.700 --> 24:12.367
(lively music playing)

24:16.233 --> 24:19.533
(closing theme music playing)
