[soft gasping]

02:09.629 --> 02:11.631
[gasping]

03:04.767 --> 03:05.977
He thinks you don't like him.

03:06.686 --> 03:08.354
You know what? Who cares if I don't?

03:08.938 --> 03:10.106
Well, he does.

03:10.732 --> 03:11.774
He should get over it.

03:11.858 --> 03:14.319
Anna, I don't think you get it.

03:14.903 --> 03:16.321
Don't think I get what?

03:18.615 --> 03:19.449
Bree?

03:21.242 --> 03:22.952
Bree?

03:23.036 --> 03:25.622
Anna Hamilton?
I'm Agent Hall with the FBI.

03:25.705 --> 03:27.832
For your safety,
I need you to come with me.

03:28.291 --> 03:30.460
-What happened to my friends?
-Your friends are fine,

03:30.543 --> 03:32.378
but you won't be unless you get
in the car now.

03:32.462 --> 03:33.671
Tell me why.

03:36.424 --> 03:40.845
No! No! No! [screams] No!

03:54.442 --> 03:57.070
Anna? Anna?

03:58.863 --> 03:59.697
Anna?

04:03.701 --> 04:05.286
[steady beeping]

04:05.370 --> 04:10.083
[Marcy haltingly]  "Where will...

04:10.166 --> 04:14.045
you be? Mm."

04:14.963 --> 04:17.924
"What will you...

04:19.175 --> 04:22.303
be-become?" [chuckles]

04:22.387 --> 04:24.514
[laughs] That is so good.

04:24.597 --> 04:27.308
-You want to try the next part?
-No.

04:27.392 --> 04:29.644
Come on, girl, you can do it.

04:30.603 --> 04:31.938
Tomorrow.

04:32.021 --> 04:33.564
It can't always be tomorrow.

04:33.648 --> 04:35.400
I'm here now, so let's try.

04:35.483 --> 04:38.611
Marcy, mercy me, time to rock 'n' roll.

04:39.195 --> 04:40.280
This is her reading time.

04:40.363 --> 04:43.616
Man wants to see her now,
which makes it treatment time.

04:43.700 --> 04:45.076
-[Marcy grunts]
-[knocks] Let's go.

04:45.159 --> 04:46.953
I told her she didn't have to go today.

04:47.036 --> 04:48.913
Well, you shouldn't have said that, bud.

04:49.580 --> 04:52.292
I don't-- I don't want treatment.

04:52.375 --> 04:54.627
-Don't make me carry you again.
-[Marcy shouts]

04:54.711 --> 04:57.088
Hey! She's a person.
You treat her with respect.

04:57.171 --> 04:59.674
You do your fucking job,
or you won't have one.

05:00.675 --> 05:05.263
-I don't want to go. I don't want to go.
-I'll be here for you when it's over.

05:05.346 --> 05:08.349
No! No! Ted!

05:08.433 --> 05:10.059
Ted!

05:11.102 --> 05:14.272
I don't want treat-- I don't want it.

05:14.355 --> 05:17.233
-I don't want it.
-Hey. Hey.

05:17.317 --> 05:20.737
Behave or there'll be no ice cream after.

05:20.820 --> 05:24.657
I don't want it. I don't want it.

05:24.741 --> 05:26.075
I don't want it.

05:26.159 --> 05:30.330
Dear, sweet Marcy.
Don't be afraid, dear.

05:31.748 --> 05:35.752
I've no desire to hurt you, and I--
I mean that sincerely.

05:36.252 --> 05:37.962
Quite the opposite.

05:39.547 --> 05:41.549
I only want to make you whole again.

05:45.178 --> 05:46.846
[shuddering]

05:48.389 --> 05:49.390
What'd the messenger say?

05:49.474 --> 05:51.267
Another traveler team
needs tactical support

05:51.350 --> 05:53.186
in less than an hour
at these coordinates.

05:53.269 --> 05:54.437
Got it. Where's the boss?

05:54.520 --> 05:55.521
[comm beeps]

05:55.605 --> 05:56.814
Mac, where are you?

05:57.440 --> 05:58.858
[Trevor] They must be off comm.

05:58.941 --> 06:00.485
[Philip] We can stop by Kathryn's
on the way.

06:00.568 --> 06:02.570
-Where's Marcy?
-[Carly] Uh, she just texted me.

06:02.653 --> 06:05.490
She's having some kind of
medical procedure.

06:05.573 --> 06:07.116
We're gonna have to do the mission
without her.

06:08.201 --> 06:09.619
Okay, so nobody get shot today.

06:09.702 --> 06:11.037
Good rule in general.

06:15.416 --> 06:16.250
Hello?

06:16.334 --> 06:19.337
Hi! I'm so sorry to bother you
at home, Kathryn.

06:19.420 --> 06:20.838
Wait-- how do you know my name?

06:20.922 --> 06:24.133
He's one of my CI's--
who knows better than to come here.

06:24.217 --> 06:26.844
-It's an urgent CI thing.
-All right.

06:26.928 --> 06:29.138
But are you the one
who stole my husband's car?

06:29.222 --> 06:31.682
-Well, actually, that's a funny story.
-For another time.

06:32.225 --> 06:33.434
Be back soon.

06:46.739 --> 06:48.032
Look, um...

06:49.033 --> 06:50.535
I need this job.

06:55.623 --> 06:56.791
Just, um...

06:58.292 --> 06:59.377
don't let it melt.

07:09.053 --> 07:11.681
Marcy, did it work this time?

07:13.057 --> 07:13.891
[sighs]

07:13.975 --> 07:17.478
I told him the information transfer
was way, way too slow.

07:18.062 --> 07:19.188
I tried to fix it.

07:20.690 --> 07:22.316
To get you back in.

07:23.651 --> 07:25.027
You're still in there.

07:25.570 --> 07:27.697
You don't know because you're not here.

07:30.241 --> 07:31.325
He knows.

07:32.493 --> 07:36.205
I'll keep trying, but squib transistors
barely even exist here and now.

07:36.289 --> 07:37.457
You gonna eat that?

07:38.875 --> 07:39.709
Can I have it?

07:41.836 --> 07:42.753
Okay.

07:48.676 --> 07:50.595
Well, if they're after me, then...

07:51.179 --> 07:52.513
how do you know my parents are safe?

07:52.597 --> 07:55.391
Well, because they're
also under protection, all right?

07:55.475 --> 07:57.101
And that's question number six.

08:01.022 --> 08:02.440
Aw, fuck me.

08:04.066 --> 08:05.276
What are you doing here?

08:05.359 --> 08:07.361
I'm not exactly thrilled about it, either.

08:08.112 --> 08:10.823
We got a messenger--
tactical support at these coordinates.

08:10.907 --> 08:11.741
Tactical.

08:13.117 --> 08:14.911
You know, I, uh, I think we're good.

08:14.994 --> 08:16.621
Director doesn't seem to think so.

08:17.622 --> 08:19.081
Where are all the customers?

08:19.165 --> 08:20.291
You ever eat here?

08:20.374 --> 08:21.792
Mmm. I like it.

08:24.962 --> 08:25.796
Who's she?

08:27.131 --> 08:28.883
It's, uh, 53.

08:30.551 --> 08:32.470
As in POTUS.

08:32.553 --> 08:35.765
Centuries before my time,
but I'm pretty sure the 53rd president

08:35.848 --> 08:37.391
was another old white guy.

08:37.475 --> 08:39.894
Do you even remember
the other candidate that year?

08:39.977 --> 08:43.856
How close that election was and how
the country was torn apart after?

08:45.942 --> 08:48.361
Anna, say hello
to Special Agent MacLaren.

08:48.444 --> 08:50.655
It's an honor to meet you,
Miss Hamilton.

08:55.535 --> 08:56.369
Hi.

08:58.329 --> 09:00.498
So, are you assigned to protect me, too?

09:00.581 --> 09:03.459
-Actually, they didn't--
-Yeah, no, he is, until 1600 hours.

09:03.543 --> 09:04.877
Why do I need protection?

09:04.961 --> 09:07.505
We had an agreement, right?
Ten questions. You're at eight.

09:07.588 --> 09:08.881
Ten questions?

09:09.465 --> 09:11.759
-Yeah, whatever.
-What happens at 1600?

09:11.842 --> 09:15.346
How should I know? All I gotta do
is make sure that until then, she's--

09:15.429 --> 09:18.349
Hey, hey! Hey, hey!
Get her to cover now! Now!

09:25.106 --> 09:27.233
FBI! Get down and stay down!

09:27.316 --> 09:29.151
[gunshots]

09:30.278 --> 09:31.112
We just lost a camera.

09:32.655 --> 09:33.864
Tracking four targets.

09:36.701 --> 09:38.327
[Hall] You call this tactical?

09:38.411 --> 09:39.453
Carly! Trevor!

09:39.537 --> 09:40.371
Ready, boss!

09:40.454 --> 09:41.872
In position.

09:43.541 --> 09:45.126
[gunshots]

09:47.378 --> 09:48.379
[groans]

09:50.256 --> 09:51.465
[bullet ricochets]

09:51.549 --> 09:53.759
Trevor, your nine o'clock, moving
to the west side of the restaurant.

09:53.843 --> 09:55.344
[gunshots]

10:03.561 --> 10:07.481
[whirring]

10:16.240 --> 10:17.742
The Director got the last one.

10:17.825 --> 10:19.744
We can't count on the Director
to have eyes everywhere.

10:19.827 --> 10:21.454
-We should move.
- Stand by.

10:21.537 --> 10:23.372
We're moving somewhere safe.

10:23.456 --> 10:25.541
We were fine until you showed up.

10:25.625 --> 10:26.834
They must have followed you.

10:26.917 --> 10:29.712
If we hadn't been ordered here,
you'd be dead and so would 53,

10:29.795 --> 10:32.715
who I am taking to a safe house
right now, with or without you.

10:33.299 --> 10:34.425
MacLaren's right.

10:35.259 --> 10:36.093
We should go.

10:39.639 --> 10:40.473
Yeah.

10:45.019 --> 10:47.480
-[steady beeping]
-[water splashes]

10:47.563 --> 10:49.482
[man]  Come on, girl, eat up.

10:49.565 --> 10:51.359
Don't have time for this shit.

10:51.984 --> 10:53.778
You know what happens if you don't.

10:53.861 --> 10:55.529
[Marcy] I want to go home.

10:55.613 --> 10:57.198
This is your home now.

10:57.281 --> 11:00.117
No, I work here.

11:01.118 --> 11:02.995
Get that out of your head.

11:03.079 --> 11:04.747
I remember.

11:04.830 --> 11:07.750
All right. Doesn't have
to be the hard way.

11:07.833 --> 11:08.751
Don't make me do this.

11:08.834 --> 11:09.835
Hey!

11:09.919 --> 11:11.629
You do it again and I'll report you.

11:13.339 --> 11:14.548
You'll report me?

11:16.509 --> 11:19.762
I'm not the one who looks at her ass
every time she walks away.

11:19.845 --> 11:21.055
I don't do that.

11:21.138 --> 11:22.515
Don't get me wrong, it's nice.

11:22.598 --> 11:25.017
Treat her with respect,
or I'll talk to Dr. Carroll.

11:25.101 --> 11:26.268
Carroll?

11:26.352 --> 11:28.354
[laughs] That's perfect. Boom!

11:28.437 --> 11:32.066
Yeah, you go ahead and do that
while I feed your hot little girlfriend.

11:36.487 --> 11:37.696
[groans]

11:39.031 --> 11:40.157
[man] You are done.

11:41.158 --> 11:44.412
Don't even bother signing out.
I don't want to see your face.

11:46.330 --> 11:47.498
-[kicks foot]
-[groans]

11:57.967 --> 11:59.593
I need to use the bathroom.

11:59.677 --> 12:02.179
It's not far now. You just have
to hold it a little longer...

12:03.556 --> 12:04.890
Madam President.

12:06.475 --> 12:09.311
So, in this timeline,
she actually wins the election?

12:09.395 --> 12:11.063
Why would the Faction
not want that?

12:11.147 --> 12:12.690
They're working off old information.

12:13.274 --> 12:14.692
Where are we going?

12:14.775 --> 12:18.028
That is an excellent question, Anna.
You've got one left.

12:18.112 --> 12:20.698
It's an old farmhouse that I know of.
We should be safe there.

12:20.781 --> 12:23.451
That's what Special Agent Hall
said about the restaurant.

12:24.535 --> 12:25.369
Agent?

12:26.454 --> 12:27.496
Special.

12:28.789 --> 12:30.207
Why isn't Marcy with you?

12:30.291 --> 12:33.085
Some sort of minor medical procedure
I wish she'd told me about.

12:33.169 --> 12:34.211
Is she all right?

12:35.296 --> 12:36.505
I'm sure she's fine.

12:37.840 --> 12:39.675
[steady beeping]

12:43.512 --> 12:45.347
[clattering]

12:53.981 --> 12:55.566
[Marcy imitates squeaking brakes]

12:57.359 --> 13:00.237
Simon. That's beautiful.

13:00.321 --> 13:01.780
Thank you.

13:01.864 --> 13:02.865
I like it.

13:03.866 --> 13:05.284
Who is she?

13:05.367 --> 13:06.952
0092.

13:07.787 --> 13:09.246
No, I mean, what's her name?

13:09.330 --> 13:10.664
0092.

13:11.207 --> 13:12.750
She's not born for another two--

13:13.626 --> 13:15.586
no, hundreds of years from now.

13:15.669 --> 13:17.796
Ohh. That's a very long time.

13:17.880 --> 13:19.298
Yes, it is.

13:19.381 --> 13:21.133
Home, sweet home.

13:21.634 --> 13:23.636
The ozone layer is gone by then.

13:23.719 --> 13:25.930
That's just one problem.

13:26.013 --> 13:29.558
In a hundred years, it's way worse.
We live under the ice.

13:29.642 --> 13:31.060
Mmm.

13:31.143 --> 13:32.978
That's not that complicated.

13:33.062 --> 13:35.439
You have two people
that want the same thing...

13:36.440 --> 13:39.527
the two people fight over the one,
and then there's none.

13:40.110 --> 13:44.114
Well, I have two pills...

13:46.033 --> 13:47.117
for one person.

13:47.201 --> 13:48.953
Okay? Here you go.

13:50.454 --> 13:53.332
I'm not supposed to take anything
before treatment.

13:53.415 --> 13:55.251
Marcy, isn't it?

13:56.627 --> 13:58.879
-Uh, yeah.
-Good. I was hoping to catch you.

13:58.963 --> 14:02.591
Simon is correct that I prefer he
not be medicated during the treatment.

14:02.675 --> 14:05.261
Well, there's a daily schedule,
Mr. Ingram.

14:05.344 --> 14:07.513
Maintenance of the yeast vats,
first and foremost,

14:07.596 --> 14:09.848
is your responsibility to the community.

14:09.932 --> 14:13.602
Please, Simon, allow me
to speak with the orderly.

14:14.603 --> 14:15.604
You go on ahead.

14:24.488 --> 14:26.323
An hour is all I ask.

14:26.407 --> 14:28.200
Dr. Carroll approves.
You can check with her.

14:28.284 --> 14:30.703
Dr. Carroll's gone home, and I can't--

14:30.786 --> 14:34.081
Perhaps if you understood more
about the therapy I was working on.

14:35.374 --> 14:36.917
Of course you're curious.

14:37.001 --> 14:38.168
More concerned.

14:38.711 --> 14:42.298
A few of the patients who've
gone through your treatment haven't...

14:42.381 --> 14:44.383
Returned to the ward?

14:48.512 --> 14:50.556
Because they've been transferred
to another hospital

14:50.639 --> 14:52.933
as promising candidates
for further research.

14:53.017 --> 14:54.351
I can show you the paperwork.

14:57.813 --> 15:01.233
The work we're doing here is truly
for the greater good, Marcy.

15:01.317 --> 15:05.112
We're... making progress, I promise.

15:08.908 --> 15:13.704
In fact, if you're open to it,
I could use your help.

15:23.923 --> 15:25.132
That's a nice spot.

15:25.215 --> 15:26.634
Glad you approve.

15:26.717 --> 15:29.553
That sign on the road says it's for sale.
Might be a good investment.

15:29.637 --> 15:31.639
FBI seized the house from a meth cook

15:31.722 --> 15:34.475
who burned himself to death
in the kitchen, so...

15:34.558 --> 15:36.185
So, big kitchen.

15:36.810 --> 15:40.272
I need you to set these Claymores
up there and there.

15:40.356 --> 15:41.190
We can do that.

15:41.273 --> 15:43.901
Conceal 'em best you can,
then run the wires back to the house.

15:44.902 --> 15:46.570
What, you take orders
from your tactician?

15:47.363 --> 15:48.197
So should you.

15:50.157 --> 15:52.785
Hey, I can still tell
you got a problem with me,

15:52.868 --> 15:54.370
but you gotta get over that, right?

15:54.453 --> 15:56.789
The Director keeps putting us together,
must be some good reason.

15:56.872 --> 15:58.290
Ours is not to reason why...

15:58.374 --> 16:00.793
It's like we're two disciples,
but we don't see eye to eye.

16:00.876 --> 16:02.086
Not in the mood for mythology.

16:02.169 --> 16:05.422
We're both disciples, all right?
So... what are you gonna do?

16:05.506 --> 16:08.842
-What I'm trying to say, MacLaren--
-Don't fucking touch me, Hall!

16:08.926 --> 16:10.844
Take it easy. Relax.

16:12.179 --> 16:13.597
Let's just get to 1600.

16:18.602 --> 16:20.562
[gunshots]

16:31.657 --> 16:33.867
The technology scans the brain

16:33.951 --> 16:37.121
and it records specific patterns,

16:37.204 --> 16:40.040
not dissimilar to something
like an MRI.

16:40.416 --> 16:42.835
Uh, what exactly am I signing?

16:42.918 --> 16:44.128
Legalese.

16:47.006 --> 16:51.427
The fee for allowing me
to perform the scans is on the last page.

16:57.224 --> 16:58.308
That's a lot of money.

16:59.143 --> 17:00.519
Is it?

17:01.353 --> 17:04.189
I'm embarrassed
to say that I've lost perspective.

17:11.822 --> 17:13.741
Simon. What are you doing here?

17:15.242 --> 17:17.828
I helped build the first one
in the future, too.

17:18.120 --> 17:19.455
Good for you.

17:20.247 --> 17:24.043
He likes to assist.
I consider it part of his therapy.

17:24.835 --> 17:27.546
Uh, Mr. Ingram, uh...

17:27.629 --> 17:29.006
I've changed my mind.

17:29.089 --> 17:31.008
You signed the papers. You can't.

17:31.091 --> 17:32.801
-I just did.
-No...

17:33.385 --> 17:36.055
Marcy, it's a harmless scan.
You won't feel anything.

17:36.138 --> 17:39.224
-[stammering] I don't feel comfortable.
-Please, be reasonable.

17:39.308 --> 17:40.851
I'm sorry. You can keep your money.

17:40.934 --> 17:42.895
It's not about the money, my dear.

17:42.978 --> 17:45.189
But now you've seen the device, and, uh...

17:45.272 --> 17:46.482
this is awkward.

17:46.565 --> 17:47.649
Drake!

17:50.194 --> 17:52.529
-Move.
-Unh-unh-unh-unh.

17:52.613 --> 17:53.906
[screams] Let go of me!

17:53.989 --> 17:56.033
[muffled screaming]

18:01.705 --> 18:03.874
You really should read
everything you sign.

18:03.957 --> 18:06.168
[screaming continues]

18:07.252 --> 18:10.005
[monitor beeping]

18:17.012 --> 18:18.847
[porch swing creaking]

18:27.523 --> 18:30.776
I'm always in awe
of the potential of youth.

18:31.360 --> 18:32.444
What may come.

18:33.529 --> 18:35.697
Even if we didn't know who she was.

18:35.781 --> 18:37.199
If we succeed in our mission,

18:37.282 --> 18:39.910
she'll become one of the great leaders
of her generation.

18:39.993 --> 18:40.994
Mm-hmm.

18:41.995 --> 18:45.249
So, I'd very much like to make it
to four o'clock.

18:45.332 --> 18:48.127
I wonder if it's a coincidence that
the Director assigned you a mission

18:48.210 --> 18:51.296
to preserve the life of a child
after what happened to you and Kathryn.

18:53.132 --> 18:56.426
I think the Director isn't
a licensed therapist and neither are you.

18:56.969 --> 18:59.429
I do understand what you're going through.

18:59.513 --> 19:02.015
-You couldn't possibly.
-Yeah, I do.

19:03.142 --> 19:04.685
Even you forget
I've lived long enough

19:04.768 --> 19:07.729
to see two of my own sons die
of old age.

19:08.730 --> 19:10.315
No, this isn't the same thing.

19:10.399 --> 19:12.234
Yeah, you're right, it isn't.

19:13.235 --> 19:15.404
You're grieving a life lost
that hadn't even begun yet.

19:16.738 --> 19:18.157
A loss of potential.

19:19.867 --> 19:22.369
Anna has that, all I'm saying.

19:31.170 --> 19:32.379
We got vehicles.

19:34.506 --> 19:35.632
Yeah, I see 'em.

19:35.716 --> 19:37.759
Anna, get inside.

19:38.594 --> 19:40.512
The Director will, too,
as soon as they get closer.

19:40.596 --> 19:42.681
Smile for the camera, Mr. Faction.

19:45.517 --> 19:47.144
Protocol three suspended.

19:47.978 --> 19:51.523
Protect Anna Hamilton at all cost
and hold until reinforcements arrive.

19:55.611 --> 19:56.445
What just happened?

19:56.528 --> 19:59.239
Nothing happened.
Just go inside. You're fine.

20:02.826 --> 20:06.163
Here I thought we were gonna make it
to 1600 without any trouble.

20:22.221 --> 20:25.599
[Drake] She doesn't even recognize me.
There was a malfunction.

20:25.682 --> 20:27.684
Some information was lost
during the scan.

20:27.768 --> 20:29.770
Simon is working to restore it soon.

20:29.853 --> 20:30.687
Simon?

20:30.771 --> 20:33.482
Until then, Marcy's now to be
considered a patient of this facility

20:33.565 --> 20:35.234
under the care of Dr. Carroll.

20:35.317 --> 20:37.027
Dr. Carroll agreed to that?

20:37.110 --> 20:38.528
And so will you.

20:39.863 --> 20:43.116
I can make you very wealthy
very easily.

20:46.245 --> 20:48.247
We can move patients
to different wings,

20:48.330 --> 20:51.250
but there'll still be staff who know
Marcy is an employee.

20:51.333 --> 20:54.503
Bribe those you can
and get rid of the rest.

20:55.462 --> 20:56.797
I leave it to you.

21:19.528 --> 21:21.446
[Carly] The Director should
turn every one of them into hosts

21:21.530 --> 21:23.407
or kill them by messenger
as soon as they're on camera.

21:23.490 --> 21:25.242
-Maybe Anna should hide upstairs--
-Don't.

21:25.993 --> 21:28.662
If they don't find her,
they'll burn this place to the ground.

21:28.745 --> 21:31.331
-That's what I would do.
-Really?

21:33.125 --> 21:34.334
And you...

21:35.711 --> 21:37.129
keep your head down.

21:37.212 --> 21:38.755
Why do they want to hurt me?

21:39.464 --> 21:41.049
Because they're afraid of you.

21:41.133 --> 21:42.134
More than you?

21:42.509 --> 21:44.136
Even more than me, yes.

21:45.470 --> 21:47.014
Why don't we just talk to them?

21:48.890 --> 21:51.226
Wow. Even now.

21:54.146 --> 21:55.981
Anna, this won't happen,

21:56.064 --> 21:59.234
but if they manage
to get through this door

21:59.318 --> 22:02.487
and they try to take you,
you fight them.

22:03.071 --> 22:05.991
And you keep fighting,
because help is on the way, okay?

22:08.744 --> 22:09.578
Okay.

22:16.501 --> 22:18.211
[Philip]  No, no, no. I can do this.

22:18.295 --> 22:19.921
[Marcy]  We have a mission today.

22:20.005 --> 22:21.631
You're no good to anyone like this.

22:22.299 --> 22:24.301
Oh, God, that's better.

22:24.718 --> 22:26.219
Just enough for you to function.

22:27.554 --> 22:28.555
Here.

22:30.599 --> 22:32.768
I'm back to human. Thanks.

22:34.561 --> 22:35.771
Well, that's what I'm here for.

22:37.355 --> 22:38.774
But when I'm gone...

22:38.857 --> 22:39.858
You don't say that.

22:42.569 --> 22:43.779
It's gonna happen.

22:45.363 --> 22:46.573
And probably soon.

22:48.200 --> 22:51.078
The seizures are just getting worse,
and I can't stop them.

22:51.161 --> 22:52.996
[rapid beeping]

22:54.122 --> 22:56.875
[grunts]

23:00.253 --> 23:01.880
[rapid beeping continues]

23:16.812 --> 23:18.939
-[Hall] Seriously?
-It's all we got.

23:20.023 --> 23:21.441
No, this'll help.

23:25.028 --> 23:27.114
I didn't think the Director
would let them get this close.

23:32.536 --> 23:35.080
We can't wait for the Director.
Aim center mass.

23:35.163 --> 23:36.248
Shoot what I shoot.

23:38.542 --> 23:40.043
[silenced gunshot]

23:40.961 --> 23:42.254
[silenced gunshot]

23:52.222 --> 23:54.224
[gunfire]

24:48.320 --> 24:49.738
Oh, crash!

24:49.821 --> 24:52.490
[chuckles] Sorry, I didn't see that--
that move coming.

24:52.574 --> 24:56.661
-You okay?
-[haltingly] I'm fine.

24:57.996 --> 24:59.623
I'm fine.

24:59.706 --> 25:02.125
Uh, I was watching you there a little bit,

25:02.209 --> 25:04.377
and I was thinking you looked lost.

25:05.420 --> 25:06.504
Maybe I can help?

25:07.339 --> 25:10.592
-Is there some family that I can--
-[groaning]

25:12.177 --> 25:14.095
Turns out we're going
the same way, anyway.

25:15.055 --> 25:16.389
Um... what's your name?

25:16.473 --> 25:19.851
Um... Marcy.

25:19.935 --> 25:20.769
Marcy.

25:20.852 --> 25:21.853
-Yeah.
-Seriously?

25:21.937 --> 25:22.938
Yeah.

25:23.563 --> 25:26.983
That is easily in my top ten
favorite names in the whole world.

25:27.067 --> 25:29.736
-You're the first one I've met in person.
-[chuckles]

25:32.739 --> 25:33.573
My name's David.

25:34.407 --> 25:36.785
[rapid beeping]

25:41.539 --> 25:42.958
[gunfire]

25:45.585 --> 25:47.837
[gunfire]

25:48.630 --> 25:50.465
Four are coming around the south side.

25:51.049 --> 25:52.175
Hall, that's you!

25:52.551 --> 25:53.843
I know, I know!

25:56.721 --> 25:59.266
Fuckin' Alamo! Where's the Director?

25:59.349 --> 26:01.351
They've got to have an STA.

26:02.477 --> 26:06.189
-What?
-A space-time attenuation device.

26:06.273 --> 26:09.359
Creates a field around 'em
in which the Director can't see 'em!

26:12.195 --> 26:15.490
I see the STA. It's in the green truck,
under the tarp.

26:15.573 --> 26:17.575
Trevor, we need an end run.

26:17.659 --> 26:18.702
Go.

26:19.744 --> 26:22.289
[Trevor grunts] Son of a bitch!

26:23.415 --> 26:24.666
Cover him!

26:24.749 --> 26:26.668
Cover him! Go!

26:26.751 --> 26:29.754
[gunfire]

26:33.133 --> 26:35.302
[glass shatters]

26:38.805 --> 26:40.807
Like I said, it isn't much.

26:42.225 --> 26:44.436
But it's... not the street.

26:45.228 --> 26:46.730
And it's subsidized.

26:47.230 --> 26:49.649
Do-- do you live here?

26:50.608 --> 26:53.611
No. This is your place now, remember?

26:55.030 --> 26:57.782
See, there's a--
there's a bed in here with...

27:00.035 --> 27:02.120
clean sheets, like I promised.

27:02.746 --> 27:05.749
And, good, there's a towel, too.

27:07.042 --> 27:09.627
And a dresser, put all your things.

27:12.255 --> 27:16.217
So, first thing tomorrow,
we'll go get you some things.

27:18.261 --> 27:20.472
In here, there's a little fridge

27:21.056 --> 27:24.559
to keep your milk
for your cereal or your tea.

27:25.477 --> 27:26.519
You like tea?

27:26.603 --> 27:28.897
Previous tenant left a big chunk
of chocolate.

27:29.481 --> 27:30.690
No, that's hash.

27:32.275 --> 27:33.485
Take that away.

27:34.569 --> 27:35.653
And...

27:39.824 --> 27:41.242
Good. That works too.

27:41.326 --> 27:43.328
You have a light to read your book by.

27:43.411 --> 27:45.038
[Marcy giggles]

27:46.081 --> 27:48.083
So, I will let you get settled in.

27:49.250 --> 27:51.878
No, don't go.

27:53.546 --> 27:55.048
Oh, I have to go.

27:55.882 --> 27:57.592
I have other clients.

27:57.675 --> 28:00.011
[stammers] I did look up the--

28:00.095 --> 28:02.305
the hospital you said you were
a patient at.

28:02.389 --> 28:03.431
I work there.

28:04.974 --> 28:05.809
You work there?

28:05.892 --> 28:07.018
Mm-hmm.

28:07.102 --> 28:09.729
Huh. Well, that's different.

28:09.813 --> 28:11.981
Either way, they said they had
no record of you.

28:12.065 --> 28:14.651
-Ohh!
-Don't go.

28:14.734 --> 28:15.568
Okay.

28:18.696 --> 28:20.115
I still have to go.

28:21.199 --> 28:24.411
But I will be back tomorrow morning
to take you shopping.

28:25.912 --> 28:27.247
Oh, don't do that.

28:28.081 --> 28:29.999
[sobs]

28:30.542 --> 28:31.501
-Okay?
-Okay.

28:37.632 --> 28:38.883
Don't forget to lock up.

28:38.967 --> 28:39.801
Okay.

28:47.225 --> 28:48.309
Okay.

28:48.810 --> 28:50.395
[gunfire]

28:54.357 --> 28:56.192
[groans]

28:56.276 --> 28:58.695
[panting]

28:58.778 --> 29:00.071
[gunfire]

29:05.660 --> 29:07.078
[knock on door]

29:07.162 --> 29:08.371
David?

29:13.168 --> 29:14.169
Surprise.

29:15.170 --> 29:16.296
Hey.

29:16.379 --> 29:19.716
I know I said the paperwork
was gonna take seven days, but...

29:20.759 --> 29:21.760
it only took a week.

29:21.843 --> 29:22.927
[chuckles]

29:26.765 --> 29:28.141
Oh, you put some pictures up.

29:32.604 --> 29:33.646
Nice.

29:35.148 --> 29:38.318
Uh, so this is the paperwork
we need to sign

29:38.401 --> 29:40.111
in order to get you something to live on.

29:40.195 --> 29:41.613
I've already filled out most of it.

29:41.696 --> 29:44.032
We're just missing some things.

29:44.115 --> 29:45.116
Um...

29:45.200 --> 29:47.285
Do you happen
to remember your birthday?

29:50.997 --> 29:53.208
It's not a problem. We'll pick a day.

29:55.210 --> 29:58.880
Oh, wait. It's today.
What are the odds?

29:58.963 --> 30:02.175
Well, it's one in 365, but...

30:02.258 --> 30:04.093
as long as we're saying today.

30:07.096 --> 30:09.432
They're for my birthday?

30:10.016 --> 30:12.018
Yeah. Everybody deserves
a birthday present.

30:13.019 --> 30:14.270
[laughing]

30:16.022 --> 30:18.817
[chuckles] It's not brand-new, but, uh...

30:18.900 --> 30:20.735
it'll hold your stuff when you go outside.

30:24.030 --> 30:26.574
[Marcy gasps happily]

30:26.658 --> 30:29.661
My mom always says that it's bad luck
to give a bag as a gift

30:29.744 --> 30:31.371
without putting money in.

30:32.455 --> 30:35.708
Which I guess is why I always ask
for a new bag every Christmas.

30:36.292 --> 30:38.711
The only thing we need
to figure out now is your age.

30:39.420 --> 30:43.508
I'm guessing somewhere between 22 and 26.

30:44.133 --> 30:45.176
You pick.

30:45.260 --> 30:46.886
You pick.

30:49.639 --> 30:50.473
Forty-two.

30:50.557 --> 30:52.392
[chuckling]

30:52.475 --> 30:53.685
Fifty-six.

30:55.353 --> 30:56.187
Seven.

30:56.271 --> 30:58.481
[laughing] No!

30:58.565 --> 31:00.608
Well, you told me to pick!

31:00.692 --> 31:03.069
Okay, we'll go with--

31:03.152 --> 31:04.571
we'll go with 25.

31:04.654 --> 31:07.323
[laughing]

31:36.686 --> 31:38.062
Carly.

31:38.146 --> 31:39.647
I see it.

31:44.485 --> 31:45.528
Hit the Claymores!

31:45.612 --> 31:46.946
Wait for my order.

31:55.622 --> 31:57.040
There's two going 'round the back!

31:57.123 --> 31:58.291
[Philip] Understood.

32:31.783 --> 32:33.368
It stopped short of the mines.

32:38.623 --> 32:39.582
Carly!

32:47.924 --> 32:49.342
[whirring]

32:49.425 --> 32:51.260
[screaming]

33:47.025 --> 33:50.361
"'You're... a...

33:50.445 --> 33:54.157
big... girl now,'

33:54.240 --> 33:58.870
said Mary's teacher."

34:00.621 --> 34:01.622
Hmm.

34:02.248 --> 34:04.083
I couldn't have read it better myself.

34:04.167 --> 34:05.626
-[laughs]
-Have you been practicing?

34:05.710 --> 34:07.962
-Mm-hmm.
-[both chuckle]

34:08.046 --> 34:09.964
Well, that deserves a--

34:10.465 --> 34:13.968
I better check to see what I have on me
before I start making promises.

34:17.472 --> 34:19.891
Oh, no, no. That for you
to buy things you need.

34:19.974 --> 34:20.850
[chuckles]

34:21.559 --> 34:25.396
Okay, we'll call it a loan. Come on.

34:35.073 --> 34:36.908
Marcy, what are you doing?

34:37.492 --> 34:40.078
You're my-- you're my boyfriend.

34:41.496 --> 34:43.581
[stammering] I can't be your boyfriend.

34:44.665 --> 34:46.292
I can be your friend.

34:47.502 --> 34:49.253
And it's not because I don't like you

34:49.337 --> 34:53.299
or you're not one of my favorite people
in the whole world.

34:53.841 --> 34:56.803
It's because it would be inappropriate.

34:59.514 --> 35:01.724
Yeah, I know, that's a big word.

35:01.808 --> 35:02.934
[Marcy] Mm-hmm.

35:03.017 --> 35:04.018
Listen.

35:05.353 --> 35:07.647
Boyfriends come and go.

35:07.730 --> 35:12.110
But if you want, you can be my BFF.

35:13.569 --> 35:15.113
That means best friend forever.

35:15.196 --> 35:16.197
[rapid beeping]

35:16.280 --> 35:17.990
[David]  And I don't
just call anybody that.

35:18.074 --> 35:20.159
[rapid beeping]

35:20.243 --> 35:21.661
[flat line beep]

35:36.134 --> 35:38.469
[MacLaren sighs]

35:38.553 --> 35:39.804
Four o'clock.

35:40.346 --> 35:42.098
Where does the time go?

35:42.181 --> 35:43.766
Is it over, Agent Hall?

35:44.767 --> 35:46.853
Yeah, I think so, Anna.

35:47.395 --> 35:50.731
-Do you agree, Agent MacLaren?
-Sure.

35:50.815 --> 35:52.775
[screen door squeaks]

35:52.859 --> 35:54.777
[Carly sighs] Gotta go. I'm late.

35:54.861 --> 35:55.695
For what?

35:58.614 --> 36:00.158
Mom? Dad?

36:02.994 --> 36:04.829
[engine starts]

36:15.464 --> 36:17.425
Mom. Dad. All these people
were trying to--

36:17.508 --> 36:19.135
-[mom] I know.
-I was so scared.

36:19.218 --> 36:21.304
It's all right, Anna.
They told us what happened.

36:21.888 --> 36:24.515
But we're here now, and we're
gonna take you someplace safe.

36:24.599 --> 36:25.600
Okay?

36:28.186 --> 36:29.562
[rapid beeping]

36:29.645 --> 36:33.482
[cell phone vibrating]

36:33.566 --> 36:35.818
[rapid beeping continues]

36:39.530 --> 36:40.740
Hey, it's me.

36:40.823 --> 36:42.450
Uh, I'm gonna be home around five.

36:43.451 --> 36:45.953
Which is when I'm usually home,
but you asked when I was gonna be home,

36:46.037 --> 36:48.456
so I am just confirming.

36:52.418 --> 36:55.296
-Did any of your people get hurt?
-Everybody made it.

36:55.379 --> 36:57.215
Why did you do this for me?

36:57.298 --> 37:00.801
Ooh, no, that's-- that's too bad.
That's question number 11.

37:03.721 --> 37:05.973
The future's gonna need people like you.

37:08.059 --> 37:09.060
Thank you.

37:10.728 --> 37:11.854
And thank you.

37:15.691 --> 37:16.817
Bye, everyone.

37:21.364 --> 37:25.159
I assume her parents historically died
trying to protect her.

37:25.243 --> 37:27.078
At 3:43 this afternoon.

37:27.161 --> 37:28.663
We'll make sure she never knows.

37:28.746 --> 37:29.956
You take good care of her,

37:30.039 --> 37:31.958
or you're gonna be answering
to both of us.

37:32.041 --> 37:34.043
We've trained for years to do just that.

37:34.126 --> 37:34.961
Good.

37:38.673 --> 37:40.091
Agent MacLaren.

37:43.261 --> 37:44.679
Agent Hall.

37:46.097 --> 37:48.391
Bugs the shit out of you,
doesn't it?

37:48.474 --> 37:49.558
[chuckles]

37:52.270 --> 37:53.271
Yep.

37:53.854 --> 37:55.439
[David]  Don't forget your favorite.

37:55.523 --> 37:58.734
[Marcy]  "Police were forced
to use tear gas to disperse a crowd

37:58.818 --> 38:00.695
shortly after a not-guilty verdict

38:00.778 --> 38:02.780
was announced outside of the--"

38:04.490 --> 38:05.574
What? [nervous chuckle]

38:07.285 --> 38:10.204
I don't want to say anything
until we talk to the doctor, but...

38:12.707 --> 38:14.333
I think a miracle's just happened.

38:16.168 --> 38:17.253
-[rapid beeping]
-Marcy?

38:18.087 --> 38:18.921
Marcy?

38:19.630 --> 38:20.548
Marcy!

38:23.592 --> 38:25.136
[rapid beeping]

38:27.179 --> 38:30.641
One, two, three, four, five.

38:31.225 --> 38:32.643
[David]  You know what I think?

38:32.727 --> 38:34.603
If I die in my sleep tonight,

38:35.354 --> 38:36.981
I'm good to go.

38:46.615 --> 38:48.242
[rapid beeping]

38:48.326 --> 38:51.495
[Carly] One, two, three, one.

38:54.498 --> 38:55.750
Where's her medical kit?

38:55.833 --> 38:57.293
-What happened?
-I just got here.

38:57.376 --> 38:59.170
Just get the bag and bring it over here.

38:59.253 --> 39:00.880
-Are you shot?
-Get the bag!

39:05.092 --> 39:07.094
-Can you charge the defibrillator?
-What?

39:07.178 --> 39:09.972
It's okay. Just take over.
Drop the bag and take over.

39:10.306 --> 39:11.682
[beeping stops]

39:11.766 --> 39:13.225
[David] Go, go, go, go, go.

39:15.227 --> 39:18.272
One, two, three, four. One...

39:18.356 --> 39:21.233
-[game buzzer beeps]
-[David groans]

39:21.317 --> 39:24.403
-Can't believe how much you suck at this.
-This is nothing like actual surgery.

39:24.487 --> 39:26.697
- Wrenched elbow-- the easiest one.
-That's not even a thing.

39:26.781 --> 39:29.617
No, it is. You know, I think I might
be a better doctor than you.

39:30.534 --> 39:32.370
[Carly gasps]

39:35.998 --> 39:37.166
She's coming back.

39:37.249 --> 39:38.084
Oh, thank God!

39:38.167 --> 39:41.420
All right, help me get her to the bed.
We got to get her body temperature up.

39:41.504 --> 39:44.423
[David]  I thought something
terrible had happened to you.

39:45.007 --> 39:45.925
You must be David.

39:47.385 --> 39:49.220
I'm told we're close.

39:49.303 --> 39:50.304
Close?

39:52.807 --> 39:56.394
Marcy, we're very... close.

39:56.477 --> 39:57.311
Wha--

40:00.481 --> 40:01.941
What's wrong?

40:34.974 --> 40:37.977
[teakettle whistling]

40:41.856 --> 40:43.190
[gasps]

40:45.109 --> 40:46.277
No...

40:46.360 --> 40:47.987
I'll yell at you later.

40:50.489 --> 40:52.616
You find the missing pieces
you were looking for?

40:54.201 --> 40:55.619
[groans]

41:03.085 --> 41:07.047
David. You weren't supposed
to find that unless--

41:07.131 --> 41:08.549
Unless you died.

41:09.884 --> 41:11.594
Yeah, I figured that one out.

41:13.679 --> 41:15.097
How could you do this...

41:16.557 --> 41:19.351
knowing that I was probably gonna
be the one to find you.

41:22.104 --> 41:23.814
Right now, she needs to rest.

41:27.693 --> 41:28.569
Yep.

41:29.361 --> 41:30.362
Whatever.

41:39.538 --> 41:40.539
[sighs]

41:41.916 --> 41:43.042
[Grant] Hey.

41:44.710 --> 41:45.920
Sorry I was gone so long.

41:46.003 --> 41:47.087
Mmm.

41:47.171 --> 41:49.381
Mmm, it's okay. I was just dozing.

41:52.343 --> 41:53.677
Everything okay?

41:54.762 --> 41:55.596
Yeah.

41:56.263 --> 41:57.348
Everything's fine.

42:02.728 --> 42:04.146
I saved a kid today.

42:29.964 --> 42:30.965
David?

42:43.102 --> 42:44.728
[chattering]

42:47.398 --> 42:49.233
[David] Okay, I'll talk to you later.

42:49.775 --> 42:50.776
Hey.

42:50.859 --> 42:54.029
Hi. I wanted to talk to you
before you left for work.

42:55.197 --> 42:56.991
Yeah. No, I, uh...

42:57.992 --> 43:00.119
thought maybe you'd want
to thaw some more.

43:02.413 --> 43:03.497
Can we talk?

43:04.248 --> 43:05.249
Sure.

43:09.545 --> 43:11.714
If you wouldn't have found the note,
you would have never known.

43:12.715 --> 43:13.924
Doesn't make it better.

43:15.009 --> 43:16.468
It was the only way, David.

43:16.552 --> 43:17.678
To do what?

43:18.220 --> 43:21.056
To find the missing pieces of myself.

43:21.140 --> 43:22.349
To find you.

43:22.433 --> 43:24.935
Okay, so? Was it worth
almost killing yourself?

43:25.019 --> 43:26.437
Because, honestly, this is--

43:41.452 --> 43:42.661
Well, that was different.

43:44.246 --> 43:46.081
I'm sorry that I scared you.

43:48.459 --> 43:49.877
You have no idea.

43:50.669 --> 43:52.296
If I hadn't...

43:56.467 --> 43:57.301
What?

44:01.055 --> 44:01.889
What is it?

44:03.474 --> 44:04.892
Do you know who did this?

44:06.060 --> 44:10.939
Uh, yeah. It's a homeless guy,
lives around here. Why?

44:11.940 --> 44:13.817
I need you to take me to him.
