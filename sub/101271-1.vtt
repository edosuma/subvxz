[fire crackles]

02:28.389 --> 02:30.736
- What's your name?

02:30.771 --> 02:33.325
- I don't know. I can't
remember anything.

02:33.360 --> 02:34.568
- What, it's not Shane?

02:38.192 --> 02:39.193
- Yeah, I guess.

02:41.989 --> 02:43.232
[electronics beep]

02:43.266 --> 02:45.303
Oh, God, do you got one
of these things too?

02:45.337 --> 02:46.545
- Yeah, what does it do?

02:48.029 --> 02:50.135
- How the hell would I know?
I can't remember my name.

02:52.689 --> 02:55.175
All I know, I woke up
about five minutes ago,

02:55.209 --> 02:57.763
tangled up in a parachute
with this fucking thing

02:57.798 --> 03:00.214
jammed in my neck and
the next thing I know,

03:00.249 --> 03:05.219
a robot the size of King Kong
is trying to kill me, okay?

03:07.394 --> 03:08.912
That's all I know.

03:10.707 --> 03:12.261
Thank you for that, by the way.

03:12.295 --> 03:13.710
- Yeah.

03:13.745 --> 03:15.160
- Where'd you get the artillery?

03:15.195 --> 03:17.749
- Strapped to my pack. I
know about as much as you do.

03:21.442 --> 03:24.100
- So we're pretty much fucked.

03:24.134 --> 03:25.722
- Let's scramble your gear

03:25.757 --> 03:26.827
so we can find a way
out of this place.

03:44.154 --> 03:49.159
- Oh my God. [groans]

[metal clanks]
[machine powers on]

05:48.969 --> 05:51.799
- [Man] C101, please come in.

05:51.834 --> 05:53.353
C101, do you copy?

05:54.284 --> 05:56.563
Initialize boot up sequence.

05:58.703 --> 06:01.222
- [C101] C101 loading sequence.

06:02.362 --> 06:03.363
- [Man] We read
you loud and clear.

06:04.536 --> 06:06.055
We see here you're
not fully intact.

06:06.089 --> 06:10.370
See what you can find nearby.
Improvise with what you have.

06:11.129 --> 06:12.406
- [C101] Copy that.

06:12.441 --> 06:13.407
- [Man] Start up
the Roamer program.

06:14.822 --> 06:18.343
- [C101] Copy that. C101
will report in three hours.

06:18.378 --> 06:20.863
[eerie music]

06:30.010 --> 06:32.219
- Voice options execute.
- Human voice one.

06:33.393 --> 06:35.084
- Human voice two.
- Human voice three.

06:44.783 --> 06:45.612
- You all right?

06:47.855 --> 06:49.650
Saw you over there. Figured
you'd need some help.

06:51.618 --> 06:54.414
I found some food and I
got a little extra water.

07:01.835 --> 07:02.663
- Where are we?

07:04.527 --> 07:05.390
- I don't know.

07:09.221 --> 07:11.085
What'd you find?

07:11.120 --> 07:12.949
- Some kind of weapon.

07:13.812 --> 07:14.641
I don't fully know what it does.

07:18.058 --> 07:20.232
Did you see somebody
run outta here just now?

07:21.993 --> 07:24.236
It was really weird.

07:24.271 --> 07:25.099
- No.

07:26.204 --> 07:27.205
But welcome to hell.

07:29.069 --> 07:30.588
The headaches will last
a least a day or so

07:30.622 --> 07:32.659
and they sent us in
with hardly any food.

07:34.523 --> 07:35.455
- They? Who's they?

07:37.422 --> 07:39.907
[horn blares]

07:46.880 --> 07:48.433
What's with the siren?

07:49.572 --> 07:51.540
- They go off when they
send in new recruits.

07:53.024 --> 07:54.681
Seems to be a couple
times a day now.

07:56.406 --> 07:57.925
Most don't make it.

07:57.960 --> 08:00.894
I keep coming across mangled
and chicken fried bodies.

08:02.136 --> 08:04.622
[eerie music]

08:06.762 --> 08:09.350
- This doesn't make any sense.

08:09.385 --> 08:11.629
I mean, what is it,
some kind of game?

08:13.423 --> 08:15.909
[eerie music]

08:25.781 --> 08:28.369
[Shane coughs]

08:30.095 --> 08:31.200
- Yeah, it's a game.

08:33.063 --> 08:33.961
And you're losing.

08:35.756 --> 08:38.518
[Shane whimpers]

09:01.610 --> 09:04.578
- Hey.
- Oh fuck yeah.

09:08.133 --> 09:08.962
- It's good?

09:20.525 --> 09:22.734
- Oh, watch out, watch out.

09:27.843 --> 09:32.779
[horn blares]
[both groan]

09:37.335 --> 09:39.993
Okay, come on, let's go get him.

[guns fire]
[suspenseful music]

11:11.325 --> 11:14.190
What the hell was your plan?

11:14.225 --> 11:16.641
- I don't know, self defense?

11:19.955 --> 11:21.611
- That was a rough
landing. You okay?

11:24.131 --> 11:25.754
- Yeah.
[electronics beep]

11:25.788 --> 11:27.065
- Got one of those
things too, huh?

11:27.100 --> 11:29.896
[electronics beep]

11:29.930 --> 11:30.931
I'm Madison.

11:33.554 --> 11:34.383
- Brock.

11:36.247 --> 11:39.629
- Got about a week's worth
of MREs in your pack, Brock.

11:39.664 --> 11:40.492
Maybe a day's worth of water.

11:41.770 --> 11:43.495
I'd say maybe 10 matches
because most won't work.

11:44.911 --> 11:49.191
A utility knife and a machete
to fight these things.

11:52.919 --> 11:54.506
From what I can tell,
it's about six p.m.

11:55.991 --> 11:57.820
West is in that
general direction.

11:57.855 --> 11:59.028
I think. Good luck.

12:01.237 --> 12:03.170
- Wait, hold on, hey, hey.

12:03.205 --> 12:06.933
Wait, hold up, wait, I really
think we should stick together

12:08.693 --> 12:10.799
- Clearly, you're an ass.

12:12.179 --> 12:12.973
That brilliant move
you pulled back there

12:13.008 --> 12:14.664
could get us both killed

12:14.699 --> 12:16.666
and I'm not interested
in being target practice.

12:18.427 --> 12:20.981
- Okay, but I, hey, hey!

12:23.777 --> 12:25.537
I really think that we
should stick together.

12:25.572 --> 12:26.780
- I don't.

12:26.815 --> 12:28.023
- Well, you should
at least give me

12:28.057 --> 12:29.645
your weapon and
supplies. [grunts]

12:31.751 --> 12:34.408
[Madison gasps]

12:36.238 --> 12:37.446
Holy shit.

12:38.827 --> 12:40.069
- God, I hate this place.

[eerie music]

13:01.332 --> 13:03.990
[barrier beeps]

13:10.375 --> 13:11.652
Some kind of barrier.

13:16.140 --> 13:18.901
- Well, looks like
you're stuck with me.

13:39.335 --> 13:40.992
- Looks like it's
us versus them.

13:51.520 --> 13:52.348
- Wait, hold up.

13:58.423 --> 14:00.840
[eerie music]

14:12.748 --> 14:15.889
[metal clanks]

14:15.924 --> 14:17.166
Looks like somebody
was here before us.

14:18.202 --> 14:19.789
- Bastard got what it deserved.

14:23.448 --> 14:24.242
- All right, let's
get outta here.

14:24.277 --> 14:25.278
We're way too exposed.

14:26.831 --> 14:29.385
[somber music]

15:01.866 --> 15:04.524
- Hey, there might be some food.

15:07.803 --> 15:08.631
- Yeah.

15:22.852 --> 15:24.509
- I'll go see
what's around back.

16:28.780 --> 16:31.335
[door rattles]

16:33.130 --> 16:36.133
[suspenseful music]

17:08.682 --> 17:09.511
- Piper?

17:11.167 --> 17:13.686
[eerie music]

17:32.672 --> 17:35.192
[sighs] Bingo.

17:35.226 --> 17:38.885
[suspenseful music]

17:38.919 --> 17:39.920
- Don't turn around.

17:42.647 --> 17:44.546
Put the can down. Throw
your weapon over there.

17:47.376 --> 17:48.205
- Okay.
- That's it.

17:49.482 --> 17:52.001
[eerie music]

17:53.451 --> 17:57.076
- Look, we're on the same team
here, all right? I'm Shane.

17:58.284 --> 17:59.837
- I don't give a
fuck who you are.

18:02.150 --> 18:04.842
- [sighs] You had to
have seen the robots.

18:04.876 --> 18:07.500
- Keep your hands up
and your mouth shut.

18:07.534 --> 18:08.777
[eerie music]

18:08.811 --> 18:10.503
Give me your bag-
[gun fires]

18:10.537 --> 18:11.366
- Whoa! Shit!

18:13.954 --> 18:15.611
- Found this
outside in her pack.

18:17.026 --> 18:18.580
- What the hell was that?

18:18.614 --> 18:20.340
- What, did you want me
to introduce myself first?

18:20.375 --> 18:23.654
- Well, I mean, the more of
us, the better, you know?

18:23.688 --> 18:25.794
- She didn't really seem
like the reasoning type.

18:28.210 --> 18:31.524
[static crackles]

18:31.558 --> 18:34.837
[siren wails]

18:34.872 --> 18:36.356
- [General] Hello?

18:38.117 --> 18:40.015
Now that we are all
here, we can begin

18:40.049 --> 18:41.810
our little exercise.

18:43.950 --> 18:45.400
Do not be alarmed.

18:45.434 --> 18:49.404
Remember, you all volunteered
for this little experiment.

18:49.438 --> 18:52.786
And as many of you have
figured out by now,

18:52.821 --> 18:57.826
we are in the process of testing
our new military equipment.

19:00.139 --> 19:02.865
The mech series, some of
you were not as sharp.

19:05.420 --> 19:08.526
We need to find out
what variables we are
dealing with here.

19:10.114 --> 19:11.909
In this case, the
human variable.

19:13.428 --> 19:14.429
- We're guinea pigs.

19:16.155 --> 19:17.570
- You have all been
given the necessary tools

19:17.604 --> 19:18.916
to make this a fair fight.

19:20.124 --> 19:23.714
Your fate is dependent
on your will to live.

19:25.612 --> 19:28.546
We are all pulling for you
in this little exercise

19:28.581 --> 19:30.030
and of course, the government

19:30.065 --> 19:32.067
of the United States of America

19:32.964 --> 19:34.587
thanks you for your service.

19:35.829 --> 19:38.970
[eerie music]

19:39.005 --> 19:41.663
[static blares]

19:42.595 --> 19:43.527
- This is bullshit.

19:44.735 --> 19:47.565
They can't do this,
can they? Can they?

19:47.600 --> 19:48.601
- You heard the man.

19:50.396 --> 19:51.224
Let's show them what
they're working with.

20:05.687 --> 20:06.584
- Well, I think it's safe to say

20:06.619 --> 20:08.655
they're tracking our movements

20:08.690 --> 20:09.967
with these damn
things in our neck.

20:11.934 --> 20:13.281
Probably monitoring
our vitals as well.

20:15.559 --> 20:17.561
And I'm guessing if
there's a perimeter,

20:18.734 --> 20:19.908
that we're not gonna
have access to it.

20:21.461 --> 20:23.498
- Well, you're finally
starting to sound

20:23.532 --> 20:24.361
like a soldier, Shane.

20:26.604 --> 20:28.227
- I don't feel like one.

20:32.127 --> 20:33.266
[electronics beep]

20:33.301 --> 20:34.094
How many do you
think are out there?

20:35.751 --> 20:37.512
- We don't even
know where there is.

20:40.031 --> 20:41.757
There might not be
an end to this place.

20:41.792 --> 20:46.279
- Oh no, no, there
is always an end.

20:46.314 --> 20:48.902
I think our friend back
there found out the hard way.

20:51.319 --> 20:53.631
- Why do you think they
needed to erase our memories?

20:55.737 --> 20:57.566
- Well, knowledge is power.

21:00.224 --> 21:01.950
I mean, think about it,
makes it a fair game, right?

21:01.984 --> 21:05.885
Robots without awareness versus
humans without awareness.

21:08.646 --> 21:10.338
- Maybe we don't
want to remember.

21:12.892 --> 21:15.929
Maybe you killed a bunch
of insurgents, maybe...

21:17.793 --> 21:19.105
Maybe I killed my husband.

21:22.833 --> 21:26.457
- Well, it definitely
seems to be, you know,

21:26.492 --> 21:27.562
within your skillset.

21:28.873 --> 21:29.702
- Asshole.

21:31.117 --> 21:32.601
[Shane laughs]

21:32.636 --> 21:34.810
- You just blew a stranger's
head off and I'm an asshole?

21:35.673 --> 21:38.987
Okay. Okay.

21:40.747 --> 21:43.440
Well, why don't you just
take a break, all right?

21:43.474 --> 21:44.751
I'll take the first watch.

21:46.166 --> 21:46.960
We should probably
snuff this out, though.

21:46.995 --> 21:48.065
It's like a beacon.

21:49.825 --> 21:52.345

22:00.733 --> 22:02.217
Oh shit, this can't be good.

22:03.805 --> 22:04.633
- Shh.

22:06.463 --> 22:08.982
[eerie music]

22:16.438 --> 22:17.336
- More humans.

22:21.892 --> 22:23.859
- We're surrounded.

22:23.894 --> 22:25.689
- Yeah, no shit.
They're everywhere.

[gun fires]

23:19.294 --> 23:20.122
- Whoa!

23:22.366 --> 23:26.991
Shane? Shane!
[electronics beep]

23:27.026 --> 23:30.374
- Piper!
[electronics beep]

23:30.409 --> 23:31.410
- Oh no! No!

23:32.480 --> 23:34.309
- Piper, I'm out!

23:34.343 --> 23:36.656
[gun beeps]

23:37.968 --> 23:40.695
[Piper groans]

23:40.729 --> 23:43.732
[suspenseful music]

23:45.976 --> 23:46.804
- No, no!

23:49.428 --> 23:51.809
[guns fire]

23:51.844 --> 23:52.879
No!

23:52.914 --> 23:55.261
[guns fire]

23:58.575 --> 24:01.025
[drill whirs]

24:03.580 --> 24:05.892

24:11.933 --> 24:16.938
[guns fires]
[suspenseful music]

24:21.701 --> 24:24.601
- Can I get an assist?
- I'm out.

24:24.635 --> 24:25.464
- Great.

24:26.568 --> 24:29.260
[machine beeps]

24:31.677 --> 24:34.196
[Piper pants]

24:42.757 --> 24:46.312
- These are new. [grunts]

24:46.346 --> 24:48.003
Nasty little fuckers.

24:48.038 --> 24:50.247
- You fought the
big ones off too?

24:50.281 --> 24:52.421
- Well, there's a win
for the human variable.

24:52.456 --> 24:53.699
How many are with you?

24:53.733 --> 24:56.080
- Just us.
- Holy shit.

24:56.115 --> 24:57.634
- [Madison] What do
you two remember?

24:59.256 --> 25:00.464
- Nothing.

25:00.499 --> 25:01.845
Apparently, I'm
Piper. He's Shane.

25:02.984 --> 25:04.192
- I'm Madison.
- Brock.

25:05.573 --> 25:06.884
No offense, darling, Shane
seems like dead weight

25:06.919 --> 25:09.646
and I am not about to be
robot target practice.

25:09.680 --> 25:11.095
- Four is better than three.

25:11.130 --> 25:12.649
- Fine, but if we're
gonna drag his ass around,

25:12.683 --> 25:14.754
I'm gonna need one of
those fancy little kicks.

25:14.789 --> 25:18.724
They boned me out on drop
and how did you get two?

25:18.758 --> 25:20.484
- Four is better than three.
- Listen,

25:20.519 --> 25:22.866
I'm outta ammunition, all right?

25:22.900 --> 25:26.283
There was a building with
medical supplies and food.

25:26.317 --> 25:29.182
I'm guessing if they drop us
in here to test these things,

25:29.217 --> 25:31.702
there's probably some stores
of ammunition somewhere.

25:32.807 --> 25:34.360
- I counted 15
buildings in the area.

25:34.394 --> 25:35.775
Appears to be one main road.

25:36.880 --> 25:38.778
- Yeah, I don't know,
maybe 10 across?

25:39.814 --> 25:41.229
- Most of the vehicles
are bombed out

25:41.263 --> 25:42.368
which means we're probably
not the first unit.

25:43.542 --> 25:44.991
I'm sure we could find
something to jump start.

25:45.026 --> 25:46.372
Try to get our way out of here.

25:46.406 --> 25:47.891
- We were dropped
in from out of town.

25:47.925 --> 25:49.375
We ran into a barrier.

25:49.409 --> 25:52.136
We think it's about 10
miles wide all around us.

25:52.171 --> 25:55.519
- So we got to fight
whether we like it or not.

25:56.451 --> 25:58.211
- Yeah, it sure looks like that.

25:58.246 --> 25:59.903
Just don't get me
fucking killed.

26:01.076 --> 26:05.978
[suspenseful music]
[static crackles]

26:26.895 --> 26:29.864
- Sir, that Spyder unit just
deviated from its programming.

26:30.796 --> 26:31.900
It had 'em trapped.

26:33.488 --> 26:36.491
- It's been 30 hours.
No human casualties.

26:37.803 --> 26:38.666
Interesting.

26:40.357 --> 26:42.152
- There's no reason
why they shouldn't

26:42.186 --> 26:43.049
have completed their assignment.

26:44.223 --> 26:45.362
- Sir, I was pinging
their subnet addresses,

26:45.396 --> 26:46.846
but they just kept repeating.

26:48.261 --> 26:49.746
- It doesn't make any sense.

26:49.780 --> 26:50.747
Some of the mech-4s aren't
reporting anything at all.

26:50.781 --> 26:52.403
- When did this start happening?

26:53.750 --> 26:55.268
- The first drop yesterday.

26:58.824 --> 26:59.721
I'm working on it.

27:02.482 --> 27:03.829
- They're all together now.

27:07.315 --> 27:08.799
Let's up the ante.

27:10.905 --> 27:12.285
- Yes sir.

27:12.320 --> 27:15.323
[suspenseful music]

28:09.515 --> 28:11.241
- Hello?
- Come on out.

28:11.275 --> 28:14.278
[suspenseful music]

28:16.522 --> 28:19.767
- That's far
enough. Turn around.

28:24.599 --> 28:26.152
Show us your neck.

28:26.187 --> 28:29.086
[electronics beep]

28:30.432 --> 28:31.468
What do you remember?

28:33.021 --> 28:33.850
- Not much.

28:35.403 --> 28:36.887
Not really anything, actually.

28:38.475 --> 28:39.510
My head's a mess.

28:41.305 --> 28:42.134
- You didn't get a weapon?

28:43.342 --> 28:44.723
- I woke up a few
miles from town.

28:44.757 --> 28:47.035
Immediately attacked by
one of those machines.

28:48.243 --> 28:49.866
I lost my pack running
from that thing.

28:53.801 --> 28:58.150
- Well, Blake, you aren't
gonna do anyone much good

28:58.184 --> 28:59.634
hiding like a little
bitch, now are you?

29:03.017 --> 29:05.157
- On my way in, I
passed what looked like

29:05.191 --> 29:08.919
a storage facility,
like trucking docks,
things like that.

29:11.163 --> 29:12.785
I thought it might
be well stocked.

29:12.820 --> 29:14.753
Was waiting til dawn
to make a break for it.

29:18.757 --> 29:20.482
- [sighs] And then
there were five.

29:23.347 --> 29:26.281
[electronics beep]

29:28.767 --> 29:31.286
- Pull up the
remaining inventory.

29:31.321 --> 29:34.220
[electronics beep]

29:49.926 --> 29:51.755
Have any Mech-4s in the area?

29:51.790 --> 29:54.275
- Yes sir.
[electronics beep]

29:54.309 --> 29:58.175
But communications
seem to be interrupted.

29:58.210 --> 30:01.144
- Sir, we have two in proximity.

30:01.178 --> 30:02.697
We believe we can lure
them towards the subjects

30:02.731 --> 30:03.767
via radio signal.

30:04.803 --> 30:06.459
- The suspense is killing me.

30:15.089 --> 30:16.435
I hope it lasts.

30:17.988 --> 30:22.993
[machinery whirs]
[footsteps thud]

30:26.514 --> 30:29.172
[scanner beeps]

30:53.265 --> 30:54.922
- Well, at least we made
it through the night.

30:55.957 --> 30:56.889
That's a plus, right?

30:59.409 --> 31:00.479
- I'm hungry.

31:01.652 --> 31:02.515
Gonna have to stop
and refuel soon.

31:03.931 --> 31:04.863
- We stop to eat and we're dead.

31:05.794 --> 31:07.279
We can wait til I get a firearm.

31:07.313 --> 31:09.660
- Oh yeah? Who
put you in charge?

31:11.386 --> 31:12.940
- Nobody had to.

31:12.974 --> 31:14.458
You guys were obviously
having a much harder time

31:14.493 --> 31:17.116
dealing with the situation
than I am, so it makes sense

31:17.151 --> 31:18.877
that a man like me would
have to pull up the slack

31:18.911 --> 31:21.776
for you guys, don't
you agree, darling?

31:23.157 --> 31:26.332
- Touch me again and I'll
fucking blow your brains out.

31:26.367 --> 31:30.336
- Guys, chill, all
right, we're all hungry.

31:30.371 --> 31:33.926
We all want to survive this,
so just calm the fuck down

31:33.961 --> 31:36.653
and we'll take five when we
get to the facility, okay?

31:38.310 --> 31:39.138
Okay?

31:43.556 --> 31:46.042
- Plus a grenade launcher
at point blank range

31:46.076 --> 31:47.353
is probably not a good idea.

31:47.388 --> 31:48.941
That'd end our day pretty quick.

31:51.047 --> 31:53.049
[guns fire]

31:53.083 --> 31:55.361
- [Madison] Take cover!

31:55.396 --> 32:00.366
[guns fire]
[suspenseful music]

32:05.406 --> 32:07.408
- Take that one, go, go!

32:09.479 --> 32:12.723
- Fine, I'm going up high, see
if I can start something up.

32:12.758 --> 32:17.763
[suspenseful music]
[guns fire]

32:36.644 --> 32:37.990
Shit, shit.

32:38.025 --> 32:41.166
- Where's Blake?
- Where the fuck is Shane?

32:42.684 --> 32:45.687
[suspenseful music]

32:53.212 --> 32:55.007
- Hell yeah.

33:10.540 --> 33:12.404

33:12.438 --> 33:14.647
- Where's Blake?
- Where the fuck is Shane?

33:16.960 --> 33:18.755
- Pull up Agent
Shane on the screen.

33:23.484 --> 33:26.349
- Sir, we've lost
contact with the mech-4s.

33:26.383 --> 33:28.040
We're losing control
of this mission.

33:28.075 --> 33:32.355
- Your job is to observe
and report, Sergeant.

33:35.841 --> 33:38.740
We are right on track.

33:38.775 --> 33:43.055
[suspenseful music]
[guns fire]

33:43.090 --> 33:44.194
- Fuck.

[mech thuds]

34:06.182 --> 34:09.185
[suspenseful music]

34:10.978 --> 34:14.052
- Cooling down, hydraulics
down, control panel down

34:14.085 --> 34:15.053
and no signal.

34:16.226 --> 34:20.092
- I can see the damn
screen, Sergeant.

34:20.127 --> 34:25.097
[suspenseful music]
[guns fire]

34:26.788 --> 34:28.168
- [Man] Hey, run!

34:29.688 --> 34:31.414
- Gun, I need a goddamn weapon!

34:33.036 --> 34:38.041
[guns fire]
[machinery whirs]

34:51.054 --> 34:51.985
- There's another
mech-4 incoming.

34:54.333 --> 34:57.060
- Sir, we are losing control.
He's completely offline.

34:58.648 --> 35:00.822
- [sighs] Perhaps
he learned something

35:00.857 --> 35:02.030
from his brothers in arms.

35:07.933 --> 35:11.178
How's our other soldier doing?

35:12.213 --> 35:14.664
- He seems to be
doing okay, sir.

35:16.079 --> 35:18.944
It appears to have assimilated
just fine with the group.

35:18.978 --> 35:19.807
- Good.

35:22.879 --> 35:24.294
We need him to stay with them.

35:31.646 --> 35:32.440
- Nice shot.

35:34.062 --> 35:36.893
We need to get back to the
facility and arm ourselves.

35:36.927 --> 35:39.689
[footsteps thud]

35:42.036 --> 35:43.451
Where's Blake?
- I don't know.

35:45.315 --> 35:47.248
- Another mech, run!

35:47.283 --> 35:52.288
[footsteps thud]
[suspenseful music]

35:52.943 --> 35:53.703
- Over here.

35:53.737 --> 35:56.499
[suspenseful music]

36:12.342 --> 36:16.174
- I think they're gone.
- That was close.

36:16.208 --> 36:17.175
- You pussy.

36:20.178 --> 36:22.180
Where the hell were you, huh?

36:22.214 --> 36:24.354
- Hey.
- Hey, enough, enough!

36:27.806 --> 36:29.877
- You want me to fight
'em with my bare hands?

36:31.223 --> 36:32.638
Apparently I'm not wired
for combat like you.

36:34.364 --> 36:35.607
- Hey, enough, all right?

36:37.367 --> 36:38.610
If we want to get out
of this shitty bubble,

36:38.644 --> 36:40.267
we got to start working
like a team, okay?

36:43.062 --> 36:45.789
- Let's just keep
it together, okay?

36:45.824 --> 36:46.790
I don't want to end
up like that guy.

36:48.275 --> 36:50.794
[eerie music]

37:02.047 --> 37:03.428
- We won't if we
play our cards right.

37:06.465 --> 37:09.088
If this facility of yours
is a hit and a miss,

37:09.123 --> 37:10.228
I'll feed you to
the mechs myself.

37:14.922 --> 37:17.683
[computer beeps]

37:20.030 --> 37:20.859
- Shit.

37:21.825 --> 37:24.242
[computer beeps]

37:24.276 --> 37:26.071
General, we have a real problem.

37:26.105 --> 37:27.900
There are 30 mech-4s offline

37:27.935 --> 37:30.248
and another 60 Spyder
mechs unaccounted for.

37:30.282 --> 37:34.113
- I'm sorry, sir, our last
option was a Trojan horse and

37:35.598 --> 37:38.083
I've searched for all
backdoor access or any way

37:38.117 --> 37:39.395
anyone could have
gotten in, but it seems

37:39.429 --> 37:41.397
that they're communicating
on their own.

37:44.745 --> 37:46.056
- Learning, yes.

37:46.091 --> 37:51.096
[computer beeps]
[eerie music]

37:56.274 --> 37:57.516
Isn't it beautiful?

38:01.520 --> 38:02.280
- It's criminal.

38:04.282 --> 38:06.974
Sir, these mechs belong to
the United States government.

38:07.008 --> 38:08.251
And you've turned
'em into an AI army

38:08.286 --> 38:09.873
that we can't even
communicated with.

38:09.908 --> 38:12.911
Have you even
considered what happens

38:12.945 --> 38:14.499
if they breech MechWood?

38:17.605 --> 38:18.434
- I talk to them.

38:20.712 --> 38:22.714
I speak their language.

38:22.748 --> 38:25.268
[eerie music]

38:26.994 --> 38:28.513
I am their father.

38:28.547 --> 38:31.067
[eerie music]

38:33.414 --> 38:35.727
You know what, Sergeant
Peterson, you're right.

38:35.761 --> 38:39.109
We do have a problem. You.

38:39.144 --> 38:41.629
[eerie music]

38:43.286 --> 38:44.529
Send him out.

38:44.563 --> 38:45.909
- What? No, sir!

38:47.635 --> 38:50.397
- You heard me!
Get him out there!

38:51.846 --> 38:53.986
- I can fix these mechs.
They'll kill me out there!

38:54.021 --> 38:55.954
But you need me! I'm
a coding engineer!

38:58.336 --> 39:00.648
[door slams]

39:00.683 --> 39:02.132
- Pull up the
ground level camera.

39:03.720 --> 39:05.308
[computer beeps]

39:05.343 --> 39:06.171
- Yes sir.

39:08.380 --> 39:11.349
[Peterson whimpers]

39:13.143 --> 39:14.835
- No, General!

39:19.667 --> 39:24.085
Please, let me back
in, please! General!

39:24.120 --> 39:27.123

39:35.683 --> 39:38.583
[electronics beep]

39:42.414 --> 39:46.591
No! [screams]

39:49.352 --> 39:52.251
[Peterson screams]

39:56.670 --> 39:57.533
- Facility's South of here.

39:58.948 --> 40:00.777
- What else do you see?

40:00.812 --> 40:02.054
- Looks like there's some
kind of control tower

40:02.089 --> 40:03.987
just a few miles
out to the north.

40:12.755 --> 40:15.758
[suspenseful music]

40:18.485 --> 40:20.141
- What is it?

40:20.176 --> 40:21.557
- There's a massive manhole.

40:24.836 --> 40:26.734
Appears to be the
dead center of town.

40:28.667 --> 40:29.496
- Why is it here?

40:35.398 --> 40:36.226
- Maybe it leads outta here.

40:37.676 --> 40:40.127
- Let's arm up before
we waste any more time.

40:40.161 --> 40:41.818
We're sitting ducks here.

40:43.337 --> 40:45.857
I say we split up. One unit
heads South to the facility.

40:45.891 --> 40:48.515
The other will scout the
structure to the north.

40:48.549 --> 40:51.241
We'll rendezvous
back here by sunset.

40:51.276 --> 40:53.002
- I don't think we
should split up.

40:53.968 --> 40:56.350
- Well, nobody asked you, bitch.

40:56.384 --> 40:59.767
All right, I'm gonna go north.
Don't trust this guy's intel.

41:04.289 --> 41:08.224
- I'll go South with Madison
and Brock, you good with that?

41:08.258 --> 41:09.363
- Roger that.

41:12.780 --> 41:15.680
[electronics beep]

41:18.234 --> 41:20.063
- They're separating.

41:20.098 --> 41:22.997
[electronics beep]

41:24.343 --> 41:25.793
This could be fun.

41:25.828 --> 41:28.762
[electronics beep]

41:31.799 --> 41:34.526
[footsteps thud]

41:35.734 --> 41:38.461
- Hey. [whistles]

41:38.496 --> 41:41.499
[suspenseful music]

41:42.534 --> 41:44.571
Hey, come back.

41:44.605 --> 41:47.470
[footsteps thud]

41:47.505 --> 41:48.367
Come on!

41:48.402 --> 41:51.370
[suspenseful music]

41:54.166 --> 41:54.960
Go.

41:58.067 --> 42:01.208
- Shit, I didn't see anything.

42:01.242 --> 42:02.071
We're wasting time. Do you
think this is necessary?

42:03.728 --> 42:08.733
[eerie music]
[footsteps thud]

42:14.601 --> 42:16.085
Anything?

42:16.119 --> 42:18.536
- Yeah, it's about 20 feet
tall, armed to the teeth,

42:18.570 --> 42:21.021
programmed to kill
us, you happy?

42:22.194 --> 42:26.923
[machinery whirs]
[suspenseful music]

42:36.070 --> 42:37.244
- We're clear.

42:41.524 --> 42:43.250
What a bunch of junk.

42:55.193 --> 42:57.264
- We're not too far off.

43:00.508 --> 43:02.441
Seems to be some kind
of control tower.

43:02.476 --> 43:04.961
[eerie music]

43:50.386 --> 43:55.391
[static crackles]
[machinery whirs]

44:06.540 --> 44:09.681
- Start talking. Who are you?

44:09.716 --> 44:11.096
[Peterson coughs]

44:11.131 --> 44:12.650
- I'm Sergeant Brett Peterson.

44:14.790 --> 44:17.655
I'm a coding engineer with the
army special warfare division

44:19.208 --> 44:21.659
- Where's your jumpsuit?
And the shit on your neck?

44:23.488 --> 44:24.869
- I didn't sign up for this.

44:26.629 --> 44:28.804
I was taking orders
from General Dex.

44:28.838 --> 44:30.944
That voice you've heard
over the speakers.

44:33.601 --> 44:35.189
We didn't quite see eye to eye.

44:38.848 --> 44:41.299
So I got sent out here
with you guys. [coughs]

44:43.750 --> 44:45.821
But I'm not as helpless
as he thinks I am.

44:47.305 --> 44:48.133
He's forgotten.

44:49.756 --> 44:51.102
I coded these mechs.

44:52.724 --> 44:54.001
- You built these fuckers?

44:55.140 --> 44:56.383
Give me one good
reason why I shouldn't

44:56.417 --> 44:57.522
blow your fucking
brains out right now.

44:58.937 --> 45:01.733
- Because if you kill me,
you kill your only shot

45:01.768 --> 45:03.079
at getting outta here alive.

45:06.324 --> 45:07.808
What'd you think?

45:07.843 --> 45:10.500
This all ended with a pat
on the back and a medal? No.

45:14.470 --> 45:16.058
This all ends when
we get terminated.

45:18.543 --> 45:20.407
- How many of those
things are there?

45:24.066 --> 45:24.963
- Too many.

45:26.137 --> 45:27.552
And we'll run out
of food and ammo

45:27.586 --> 45:29.519
before we even get a
chance at getting 'em all.

45:31.038 --> 45:33.800
And they've been acting
different lately.

45:35.422 --> 45:37.562
They're not taking commands
from the general anymore.

45:39.046 --> 45:40.116
- Somehow you can help us.

45:41.808 --> 45:45.156
- Yeah. There's a kill switch
on the outer perimeter fence.

45:46.605 --> 45:50.195
If we get to that, we
just might have a chance.

45:58.203 --> 45:59.032
- Holy shit.

46:15.842 --> 46:17.947
- Think they're on?

46:17.982 --> 46:18.810
- I don't know, Blake.

46:20.501 --> 46:22.193
Why don't you go touch one
of 'em? See what happens.

46:24.402 --> 46:25.334
- But can they detect us?

46:26.645 --> 46:27.612
- I don't think so.

46:30.201 --> 46:31.858
We're alive, right, so.

46:34.653 --> 46:35.654
That's good.

46:38.623 --> 46:39.451
- Jackpot.

46:59.920 --> 47:02.233
[gun beeps]

47:08.308 --> 47:11.069
[computer beeps]

47:14.348 --> 47:16.454
[cheerful music]

47:16.488 --> 47:19.422
- [Man] Intelligence, is
it only in the human brain

47:19.457 --> 47:21.839
or can it be transferred,
or maybe built?

47:23.219 --> 47:25.014
Imagine a place where
intelligent machines

47:25.049 --> 47:27.465
are working hand in
hand with humans.

47:28.880 --> 47:31.020
Welcome to MechWood where
the future meets you.

47:32.159 --> 47:33.402
If you're watching this film,

47:33.436 --> 47:35.024
you're one of the
special chosen families

47:35.059 --> 47:37.889
who gets to live in this
experimental community

47:37.924 --> 47:41.237
on the cutting edge of
innovation and technologies.

47:42.721 --> 47:43.895
You will see around
you an efficient system

47:43.930 --> 47:47.450
of sustainable living
built and operated

47:47.485 --> 47:48.693
by mechanical machines

47:48.727 --> 47:50.453
or mechs, as we
like to call them.

47:51.903 --> 47:54.043
They handle many of the
dangers and menial tasks,

47:54.078 --> 47:58.806
giving humans a worry
free and luxurious life.

47:58.841 --> 48:00.532
You'll be able to spend
more time with your kids,

48:00.567 --> 48:03.639
pick up that hobby that
you've been wanting to do

48:03.673 --> 48:06.814
all while mechs handle
our trouble for us.

48:08.057 --> 48:09.058
Using human recognition coding,

48:09.093 --> 48:10.853
they can decipher a human face

48:10.888 --> 48:13.960
from nearly a mile
away and are programmed

48:13.994 --> 48:17.549
to steer clear of danger
to us, so don't worry.

48:17.584 --> 48:20.759
You'll be safe around
these gentle giants.

48:20.794 --> 48:22.106
Isn't that right, boys?

48:23.452 --> 48:25.454
The engineers at MechWood
designed nearly 30

48:25.488 --> 48:28.457
different types of
robotic assitants,

48:28.491 --> 48:31.218
all of which are under an
intricate and state of the art

48:31.253 --> 48:33.600
network of communication.

48:33.634 --> 48:35.636
The first in our
series is the mech-4,

48:35.671 --> 48:38.501
designed for
construction and repair,

48:38.536 --> 48:41.056
the mech-4 stands at a
staggering 30 feet tall

48:41.090 --> 48:44.507
and weighs nearly
62 metric tons.

48:44.542 --> 48:47.165
One mech-4 can repair and
replace 10 power lines

48:47.200 --> 48:50.928
in one day or perhaps build
and rebuild brick buildings

48:50.962 --> 48:52.412
in three days.

48:52.446 --> 48:56.140
We also have smaller mechs
like the spyder mech series.

48:56.174 --> 48:57.382
These gentle creatures

48:57.417 --> 49:00.075
are proving to be
extra helpful indoors.

49:00.109 --> 49:02.594
Need help jacking the
car up for cleaning?

49:02.629 --> 49:06.391
Maybe you need someone to
run for errands to the store.

49:06.426 --> 49:08.635
Spyder mechs are
quick and agile.

49:08.669 --> 49:12.432
Using spatial recognition,
they can scan their environment

49:12.466 --> 49:15.573
to see oncoming obstacles
in a fraction of a second

49:15.607 --> 49:18.645
and are able to calculate
the correct movements.

49:18.679 --> 49:22.442
So sit back and relax.
Welcome to easy living.

49:22.476 --> 49:24.375
Welcome to your new life.

49:25.790 --> 49:27.826
Welcome to MechWood, where
the future meets you.

49:28.724 --> 49:31.209
[eerie music]

49:32.452 --> 49:34.972
- You've got to be kidding me.

49:38.044 --> 49:39.183
Corporal Diana Blaire.

49:40.667 --> 49:43.256
I appreciate you considering
me for this opportunity.

49:43.290 --> 49:45.016
I've heard nothing
but good things.

49:46.259 --> 49:47.846
- [Man] Have you seen combat?

49:47.881 --> 49:51.816
- Yes, I've been deployed
three times, learned a lot,

49:51.850 --> 49:52.990
but I'm ready for more.

49:54.543 --> 49:57.891
I think that going to
MechWood would really push me

49:57.925 --> 49:58.754
to a new level.

50:00.100 --> 50:02.723
I would love to go to MechWood.

50:03.862 --> 50:05.071
- I'm Private Second
Class Jennifer Harrison.

50:06.831 --> 50:09.903
I'm really just looking for
a way to deepen my training.

50:09.937 --> 50:12.250
I think this could be a really
good opportunity for me.

50:13.458 --> 50:14.287
- [Man] Have you seen combat?

50:14.321 --> 50:15.150
- Yeah.

50:16.944 --> 50:17.773
Too much.

50:19.326 --> 50:20.948
- [Man] What do you
know about MechWood?

50:20.983 --> 50:22.191
- Well, I hear it's where
the best of the best

50:22.226 --> 50:24.124
go to learn, to train.

50:26.368 --> 50:30.268
I want to be the best. I
want to go to MechWood.

50:30.303 --> 50:31.649
- My name is Daniel
Brown and I just thought

50:31.683 --> 50:32.960
it was pretty
badass to be a part

50:32.995 --> 50:34.583
of something so elite, you know?

50:36.792 --> 50:38.966
- [Man] What do you expect
to learn at MechWood?

50:39.001 --> 50:41.348
- Well, I heard the
people that go to MechWood

50:41.383 --> 50:43.730
are the best, and I'm the best,

50:44.938 --> 50:46.560
so obviously, I
want to be there.

50:46.595 --> 50:50.530
I don't dick around. I take
my training very seriously.

50:50.564 --> 50:52.463
And everybody that
knows me knows

50:52.497 --> 50:56.363
that I'll do whatever it
takes to complete my mission.

50:58.469 --> 51:00.160
- I'd love to be
on the cutting edge

51:00.195 --> 51:02.921
working with the mechs to
help foster a safer future.

51:04.544 --> 51:05.993
- [Man] What do you
know about MechWood?

51:06.028 --> 51:08.996
- It's the military's most
elite training ground.

51:09.031 --> 51:12.241
Humans and the latest
of military robotics
working together.

51:13.415 --> 51:14.933
It'd be an honor
to be sent there.

51:16.211 --> 51:18.075
- [Man] Good.

51:18.109 --> 51:19.110
- They lied to us.

51:21.664 --> 51:24.219
[alarm blares]

51:25.358 --> 51:26.980
- That can't be good.
- C'mon, let's go,

51:27.014 --> 51:29.258
let's go, go, move, move!

51:29.293 --> 51:34.298
[machinery whirs]
[alarm blares]

51:37.128 --> 51:39.855
[footsteps thud]

51:47.242 --> 51:48.070
- So.

51:49.554 --> 51:51.384
Peterson thinks he's a hero.

51:54.318 --> 51:55.733
- Adding him into the mix

51:55.767 --> 51:57.010
could be a nice challenge
for the mechs' AI.

51:59.495 --> 52:00.531
- Bringing the
band back together.

52:06.985 --> 52:08.815
What do we have near town?

52:08.849 --> 52:11.645
[electronics beep]

52:11.680 --> 52:13.751
- We have five
spyder mechs headed

52:13.785 --> 52:15.339
toward Main Street, sir.

52:15.373 --> 52:16.202
- ETA?

52:18.135 --> 52:19.136
- Give or take four minutes.

52:20.654 --> 52:21.483
- Excellent.

52:22.380 --> 52:25.003
[somber music]

52:28.559 --> 52:30.216
- C'mon, c'mon.

52:30.250 --> 52:32.839
[somber music]

52:55.379 --> 52:56.794
- Did you get some ammo?

52:56.828 --> 52:58.002
- Yeah, who's this guy?

52:59.314 --> 53:00.798
- We need to find cover.

53:00.832 --> 53:02.179
We've got at least 20 mechs
on our tail, maybe more.

53:02.213 --> 53:03.456
- What?

53:03.490 --> 53:06.424
- Hey, he's with them!
He's with the general!

53:06.459 --> 53:08.219
I coded him!

53:08.254 --> 53:11.257
[suspenseful music]

53:23.441 --> 53:26.237
- I should've blown your head
off when I had the chance.

53:27.652 --> 53:30.897
- Put it down. Whatever you
have in your hand, put it down.

53:32.347 --> 53:33.451
- We're not gonna ask you again.

53:35.004 --> 53:37.490
[eerie music]

53:41.977 --> 53:44.876
[electronics beep]

53:54.610 --> 53:57.441
[Peterson groans]

54:07.658 --> 54:10.557
[electronics beep]

54:20.153 --> 54:22.983
[Peterson grunts]

54:31.337 --> 54:34.236
- You coded that mech.
You gave it life.

54:35.789 --> 54:38.102
But life does have a way of
coming around full circle,

54:38.136 --> 54:39.345
doesn't it, Sergeant?

54:40.967 --> 54:42.037
- You put me in here.

54:43.038 --> 54:45.109
Now you're really gonna find out

54:45.143 --> 54:48.043
what kind of variables
you're working with.

54:48.077 --> 54:50.804
The human kind, General.

54:54.360 --> 54:59.054
[electronics beep]
[suspenseful music]

[electronics beep]

55:03.472 --> 55:04.784
- Let's go, soldiers,
on your feet!

55:05.716 --> 55:08.166
[mechs whir]

55:10.962 --> 55:12.861
Hold tight! They attack
in a circular pattern.

55:12.895 --> 55:14.311
- Will someone tell
me who this guy is?

55:14.345 --> 55:16.727
- Sure thing, can we get
outta here alive first?

55:17.624 --> 55:18.453
- Go.

55:22.042 --> 55:24.769
[bomb powers up]

55:33.916 --> 55:34.952
- They've never been good boys.

55:34.986 --> 55:36.850
- Fire, fire, fire!

55:36.885 --> 55:39.232
[guns fire]

55:44.893 --> 55:47.792
[electronics beep]

55:53.695 --> 55:55.144
- Dump their data.

55:58.424 --> 55:59.286
Then ready X22.

56:01.150 --> 56:03.808
[computers beep]

56:28.557 --> 56:30.628
- So you gonna tell us what
the hell is going on here?

56:30.663 --> 56:31.491
We need some answers.

56:32.665 --> 56:34.908
- Yeah, but first things first,

56:34.943 --> 56:37.842
I gotta remove these control
chips from around your necks.

56:39.257 --> 56:40.431
- You put one hand on me

56:41.812 --> 56:42.813
and I will splatter the
ground with your brain matter.

56:43.814 --> 56:45.332
- Hey, he's fine.

56:45.367 --> 56:47.749
That madman dropped him in
here like the rest of us.

56:47.783 --> 56:49.647
- Yeah, plus he
sniffed out Blake, so.

56:53.133 --> 56:54.100
- I knew we shouldn't
have trusted

56:54.134 --> 56:55.101
that weaselly little shit.

56:56.516 --> 56:57.828
- As long as these chips are
on the back of your necks,

56:57.862 --> 57:00.520
the tower can see every
one of your movements

57:00.555 --> 57:01.832
and read your vitals.

57:04.973 --> 57:07.251
And if you tamper with
it, it could detonate

57:07.285 --> 57:08.770
and terminate you immediately.

57:10.081 --> 57:11.635
- So you work with the general.

57:11.669 --> 57:13.222
I saw my recruitment video.

57:13.257 --> 57:16.087
[Shane cries out]

57:17.226 --> 57:19.815
- Yeah, it might hurt a little.

57:21.748 --> 57:23.578
As long as these chips are
in the back of your necks,

57:23.612 --> 57:27.098
the tower can read
all your vitals

57:27.133 --> 57:29.894
and track all your movements.

57:29.929 --> 57:34.934
[Madison screams]
[ears ring]

57:35.831 --> 57:38.247
[chip beeps]

57:39.559 --> 57:42.010
You weren't the
only ones lied to.

57:42.044 --> 57:44.046
These mechs are no longer
under the general's command.

57:45.565 --> 57:46.601
- We're dealing with
true AI out there?

57:49.051 --> 57:51.329
- The general made these
things self actualizing,

57:51.364 --> 57:52.503
self sufficient.

57:52.538 --> 57:54.471
If one goes down
during an encounter,

57:54.505 --> 57:56.680
the others learn,
they pay attention.

57:58.026 --> 58:00.442
Making them the most
efficient killers on earth.

58:00.477 --> 58:02.513
Groups like you
have been coming in

58:02.548 --> 58:04.446
every couple months
for the past year.

58:05.585 --> 58:06.483
Red, blue, green.

58:07.587 --> 58:08.554
- Yeah, we've seen the bodies.

58:10.487 --> 58:11.453
- White seems to be
the color in fashion.

58:13.904 --> 58:16.458
I gotta admit, though,
I've never seen anyone

58:16.493 --> 58:17.390
make it as far as you have.

58:19.288 --> 58:20.289
I think we have a
real good chance.

58:22.568 --> 58:24.362
Going up against these
things at night is not wise.

58:25.225 --> 58:26.226
Especially without night vision.

58:27.918 --> 58:31.991
We should just stay here
and rest. Who's next?

58:34.580 --> 58:35.442
- Ladies first.

58:40.862 --> 58:43.761
[electronics beep]

58:46.971 --> 58:49.526
- What the hell is going on?

58:49.560 --> 58:50.630
- Peterson, sir,
looks like he removed

58:50.665 --> 58:52.218
all their coding devices.

58:55.152 --> 58:56.360
And we've lost visual on them.

58:57.706 --> 59:00.226
Sir, it appears
there's a comm request

59:00.260 --> 59:02.090
coming in from the field.

59:02.124 --> 59:06.059
[electronics beep]
[suspenseful music]

59:06.094 --> 59:10.719
- Well, put it through.
What the hell is going on?

59:12.307 --> 59:14.758
[static crackles]

59:14.792 --> 59:15.793
- You're on.

59:18.969 --> 59:21.316
- Sergeant Peterson.
- Blake.

59:22.835 --> 59:24.630
- Is.
- Yes.

59:26.252 --> 59:27.080
We know about the traitor.

59:28.426 --> 59:32.120
- I am sorry, sir.
- You did what you could.

59:34.467 --> 59:35.710
- [Blake] They reloaded, but
not before I could lead them

59:35.744 --> 59:37.125
to the facility.

59:38.609 --> 59:41.957
- You have served your
country well, soldier.

59:44.373 --> 59:45.616
Your life is not over.

59:46.859 --> 59:50.656
You will be rebuilt
and you will be better

59:50.690 --> 59:51.864
than ever before.

59:54.107 --> 59:56.213
- [Blake] Thank you, sir.

59:58.249 --> 01:00:01.080
[static crackles]

01:00:24.862 --> 01:00:27.382
[Shane sighs]

01:00:28.279 --> 01:00:29.626
- But why take our memories?

01:00:32.974 --> 01:00:34.665
- You were told to
wipe your memories

01:00:34.700 --> 01:00:36.253
so you'd have a clear
mind out in the field,

01:00:39.394 --> 01:00:41.396
but in reality it was so that
you wouldn't know the truth

01:00:41.430 --> 01:00:43.467
about what you were
getting yourself into.

01:00:48.990 --> 01:00:51.440
- All this feels kinda hazy.

01:00:52.925 --> 01:00:53.926
- Most of your memories
should come back.

01:00:55.341 --> 01:00:56.653
There are a few that
may be lost permanently.

01:00:58.965 --> 01:00:59.897
Some of you may welcome that.

01:01:05.109 --> 01:01:06.663
- You said there's a kill
switch for the perimeter?

01:01:08.112 --> 01:01:10.183
- Every program is
built with a backdoor.

01:01:10.218 --> 01:01:11.046
MechWood is no exception.

01:01:12.461 --> 01:01:14.291
The kill switch would bring
down the outer perimeter field.

01:01:15.741 --> 01:01:19.399
- We find that, we get
the hell out of here.

01:01:21.436 --> 01:01:24.025
- The genesis of MechWood
was founded on Project Titan.

01:01:25.371 --> 01:01:26.821
Human controlled weaponry.

01:01:29.340 --> 01:01:31.273
- Humans and mechs
working together

01:01:31.308 --> 01:01:32.585
to foster a better future.

01:01:34.035 --> 01:01:36.175
- That's right. That's the
reason why I came on board.

01:01:37.417 --> 01:01:39.626
But the general
deemed it inefficient.

01:01:39.661 --> 01:01:41.698
He was more in favor
of an AI interface.

01:01:42.975 --> 01:01:47.048
- [sighs] Yeah.
Welcome to MechWood.

01:01:49.222 --> 01:01:50.637
- Where the future meets you.

01:01:53.986 --> 01:01:55.228
- There's an underground bunker

01:01:55.263 --> 01:01:57.437
that houses the remains
of Project Titan.

01:01:57.472 --> 01:01:58.818
It's where all this started.

01:01:59.992 --> 01:02:02.857
We find that, we
find the kill switch.

01:02:05.722 --> 01:02:06.861
- Where is it?

01:02:08.414 --> 01:02:10.071
- I'm working on it.

01:02:10.105 --> 01:02:13.281
[computer beeps]

01:02:13.315 --> 01:02:18.320
[footsteps thud]
[eerie music]

01:02:27.329 --> 01:02:29.228
- They must all still
be in that bank.

01:02:30.401 --> 01:02:31.817
- If so, we have
no way of pinging

01:02:31.851 --> 01:02:32.990
their exact location.

01:02:34.923 --> 01:02:37.892
- There's a mech-4 on the
corner. Pull up that camera.

01:02:39.479 --> 01:02:41.965
[eerie music]

01:02:48.005 --> 01:02:53.010
[footsteps thud]
[static crackles]

01:02:59.465 --> 01:03:02.226
[guns fire]

01:03:02.261 --> 01:03:04.988
[static crackles]

01:03:16.413 --> 01:03:17.897
- It's quiet out there.

01:03:17.932 --> 01:03:19.347
- All right, the Titan site's
about a quarter mile from here

01:03:19.381 --> 01:03:22.143
- Remember, stay down low.
They can't see well below them.

01:03:22.177 --> 01:03:24.317
Also, their vision
can't multitrack quick.

01:03:25.802 --> 01:03:28.287
- Yeah, without the nerd,
we're doomed. No offense.

01:03:28.321 --> 01:03:29.598
- All right, we're gonna form

01:03:29.633 --> 01:03:30.427
a tight circle around him, okay?

01:03:30.461 --> 01:03:31.946
- You heard the man.

01:03:31.980 --> 01:03:33.602
Stay as low to the ground as
possible and don't stop moving.

01:03:33.637 --> 01:03:34.465
- Copy that.

01:03:36.295 --> 01:03:41.300
[suspenseful music]
[footsteps thud]

01:04:00.008 --> 01:04:02.735
[guns fire]

01:04:02.769 --> 01:04:04.564
- Piper, Piper, no, no!

01:04:05.669 --> 01:04:07.982
[guns fire]

01:04:10.329 --> 01:04:11.917
- Where the fuck are they?

01:04:11.951 --> 01:04:12.814
- Everywhere.

01:04:14.402 --> 01:04:15.334
- And...

01:04:15.368 --> 01:04:18.302
[guns fire]

01:04:18.337 --> 01:04:19.510
We're back in business.

01:04:20.649 --> 01:04:25.654
[guns fire]
[footsteps thud]

01:04:26.793 --> 01:04:30.659
- Okay, here we go.
Now we're talking.

01:04:31.868 --> 01:04:33.524
Data, data, data!

01:04:36.286 --> 01:04:38.667
- We're flying out that
door. Out that door now!

01:04:38.702 --> 01:04:39.806
Go go go, c'mon.
- Let's go.

01:04:39.841 --> 01:04:41.636
- Let's go, let's go.
- Let's go.

01:04:41.670 --> 01:04:44.328
[glass shatters]
[gun fires]

01:04:44.363 --> 01:04:47.366
[suspenseful music]

01:04:50.990 --> 01:04:54.856
- One of the agents
appears to be terminated.

01:04:54.891 --> 01:04:58.549
[General laughs maniacally]

01:05:03.175 --> 01:05:05.453
[guns fire]

01:05:22.228 --> 01:05:25.128

01:05:26.060 --> 01:05:28.407
[guns fire]

01:05:42.041 --> 01:05:43.732
- Why are they still
firing into the bank?

01:05:43.767 --> 01:05:46.873
The spyder mechs should've
transferred the location data!

01:05:46.908 --> 01:05:47.978
- We have visual, sir.

01:05:50.636 --> 01:05:51.637
- Give me the comm.

01:05:52.707 --> 01:05:55.710
[suspenseful music]

01:06:00.715 --> 01:06:03.442
- Next we got to remember to
zigzag until we get there.

01:06:08.033 --> 01:06:10.552
[horn blares]

01:06:12.140 --> 01:06:15.592
- [General] Congratulations,
troops, you've only lost one

01:06:17.042 --> 01:06:20.148
while managing to take out
a record number of mechs.

01:06:21.839 --> 01:06:26.844
Yeah, I see you hiding on
the corner of block eight.

01:06:28.501 --> 01:06:29.295
- Piece of shit.

01:06:31.228 --> 01:06:34.024
- [General] Lucky for you
those cameras don't fire back.

01:06:35.198 --> 01:06:37.338
- All right, guys, we
gotta stay focused.

01:06:37.372 --> 01:06:40.720
Make our way to the Project
Titan site, all right, Brock?

01:06:40.755 --> 01:06:42.653
Take the front, Madison,
middle, I'll take the rear.

01:06:42.688 --> 01:06:45.932
All right, ready,
go, go, go, move!

01:06:45.967 --> 01:06:48.970
[suspenseful music]

01:06:51.041 --> 01:06:52.491
- They're heading over
to Project Titan bunker.

01:06:52.525 --> 01:06:53.354
- Sir?

01:06:55.701 --> 01:06:56.840
- Sergeant Shapiro,
open the hatch.

01:06:58.876 --> 01:07:02.087
- Sir, the X22 prototype has
never been fully activated

01:07:02.121 --> 01:07:04.848
nor has it ever proven stable
enough for active combat.

01:07:04.882 --> 01:07:06.643
- I didn't realize you
wanted to join Peterson

01:07:06.677 --> 01:07:07.851
out in the field.

01:07:12.407 --> 01:07:13.201
- Yes sir.

01:07:15.065 --> 01:07:15.928
- This is my world.

01:07:17.171 --> 01:07:20.312
And I've got three rogue agents

01:07:21.520 --> 01:07:24.281
and a fallen comrade
back from the dead,

01:07:24.316 --> 01:07:25.972
roaming around in it.

01:07:27.008 --> 01:07:29.907
[electronics beep]

01:07:31.978 --> 01:07:35.741
I think it's time we tested
our full capabilities.

01:07:35.775 --> 01:07:38.778
[suspenseful music]

01:07:44.198 --> 01:07:45.992
- Shit, I was here
on my first day.

01:07:49.548 --> 01:07:51.860
- It's quiet out there.
Something seems off.

01:07:51.895 --> 01:07:53.172
- This whole place is off.

01:07:58.108 --> 01:07:59.799
- So let's hurry
this the hell up.

01:08:01.042 --> 01:08:03.976
[suspenseful music]

01:08:12.536 --> 01:08:13.365
- Got 'em.

01:08:14.228 --> 01:08:15.091
- C'mon.

01:08:18.162 --> 01:08:21.096
[electronics beep]

01:08:22.546 --> 01:08:23.823
- How far along are we?

01:08:23.858 --> 01:08:26.102
- Initiating sequence
has been activated.

01:08:27.171 --> 01:08:30.175
[suspenseful music]

01:08:35.041 --> 01:08:37.941
[electronics beep]

01:08:43.429 --> 01:08:45.742
- Wake up, big boy.

01:08:45.776 --> 01:08:48.779
[suspenseful music]

01:09:00.238 --> 01:09:01.412
- There it is.

01:09:02.862 --> 01:09:05.210
- What, are you saying,
the Titan's in that safe?

01:09:05.243 --> 01:09:06.520
- Yeah.

01:09:06.555 --> 01:09:09.559
[suspenseful music]

01:09:18.671 --> 01:09:19.569
- Hurry up.

01:09:24.055 --> 01:09:27.024
[metal creaks]

01:09:27.059 --> 01:09:30.062
[suspenseful music]

01:09:31.236 --> 01:09:34.446
[Peterson laughs]

01:09:34.479 --> 01:09:35.309
- You're first.

01:09:42.591 --> 01:09:43.938
- Clear.

01:09:43.971 --> 01:09:44.801
- Clear.

01:09:45.733 --> 01:09:48.736
[suspenseful music]

01:09:59.712 --> 01:10:00.541
- Wow.

01:10:01.645 --> 01:10:04.234
[somber music]

01:10:10.447 --> 01:10:11.586
Well, this must be the Titan.

01:10:15.349 --> 01:10:16.246
- What does it do?

01:10:17.834 --> 01:10:18.662
- You get in it.

01:10:22.183 --> 01:10:24.047
- Yeah, that ain't
my thing, hombre.

01:10:26.291 --> 01:10:27.257
I'm not about to trust a mech.

01:10:29.086 --> 01:10:29.915
- All right, I'll do it.

01:10:30.916 --> 01:10:33.470
[somber music]

01:10:40.719 --> 01:10:43.584
[electronics beep]

01:11:06.192 --> 01:11:08.609
- More power.
- Apparently,

01:11:08.643 --> 01:11:10.266
they didn't send us in
here with the good shit.

01:11:11.681 --> 01:11:14.615
[electronics beep]

01:11:16.341 --> 01:11:17.203
- No.

01:11:19.516 --> 01:11:20.379
No, they did not.

01:11:24.763 --> 01:11:27.041
- This should help.
- Hopefully.

01:11:27.075 --> 01:11:29.664
[somber music]

01:11:34.359 --> 01:11:37.293
[machinery clanks]

01:11:40.537 --> 01:11:42.436
- [Man] System malfunction.

[machinery whirs]

01:11:48.580 --> 01:11:49.339
- There we go.

01:11:52.204 --> 01:11:54.827
- [Man] Titan hatchway
open. Awaiting pilot.

01:11:58.348 --> 01:11:59.315
- Let's find that kill switch.

01:12:00.523 --> 01:12:02.318
- Leave that to me. You
guys go give 'em hell.

01:12:16.332 --> 01:12:17.160
- Oh no.

01:12:19.404 --> 01:12:21.026
- One of ours?

01:12:21.060 --> 01:12:22.717
- Yes and no.

01:12:24.616 --> 01:12:25.444
It's Titan.

01:12:29.172 --> 01:12:30.000
- Peterson.

01:12:34.280 --> 01:12:36.800
My new family versus
my bastard son.

01:12:43.220 --> 01:12:44.808
I hope you brought your popcorn.

01:12:46.223 --> 01:12:49.054
[machinery whirs]

01:12:59.858 --> 01:13:01.687
- You got eyes in there?

01:13:01.722 --> 01:13:04.518
- Oh yeah, we're in business.000

01:13:04.552 --> 01:13:06.761
Let's open her up, see
what she can do, huh?

01:13:08.004 --> 01:13:09.246
- Let's kill some robots.

01:13:10.627 --> 01:13:12.974
[guns fire]

01:13:16.219 --> 01:13:19.947

- Yeah, it works! [laughs]

[guns fire]
[intense music]

01:13:42.694 --> 01:13:45.455
- As soon as the X22 is
active, we're launching.

01:13:47.492 --> 01:13:50.564
- Hydraulics are up. Fuel up.

01:13:57.709 --> 01:13:58.503
Power's up.

[machinery creaks]

01:14:19.696 --> 01:14:21.077

01:14:55.594 --> 01:14:58.770
- [laughs] Wonderful!

01:15:01.324 --> 01:15:03.533
- I've never seen this
programming language before,

01:15:03.568 --> 01:15:04.914
but it appears as if
all the other mechs

01:15:04.948 --> 01:15:07.572
are dumping their
data to the X22.

01:15:07.606 --> 01:15:10.264
It's now self automating
on all functions.

01:15:11.645 --> 01:15:12.508
- Brock, you in position?

01:15:13.474 --> 01:15:15.994
C'mon, let's go go go, move!

01:15:16.028 --> 01:15:18.928
[Brock pants]

01:15:18.962 --> 01:15:22.863

01:15:41.744 --> 01:15:42.572
- C'mon.

01:15:45.161 --> 01:15:46.956
- Why are the other
mechs not reacting?

01:15:48.613 --> 01:15:49.890
They're all over Main Street.

01:15:51.995 --> 01:15:54.342

[footsteps thud]
[grenades explode]

01:15:57.622 --> 01:15:58.899
- I got more of this,
you piece of shit.

01:16:01.798 --> 01:16:03.351
- Take out the Titan, dammit!

01:16:04.836 --> 01:16:07.735
[electronics beep]

01:16:12.671 --> 01:16:17.434

[machinery clanks]

01:16:18.919 --> 01:16:20.368
- I'm going down!

01:16:23.889 --> 01:16:25.581

[suspenseful music]
[guns fire]

01:17:54.946 --> 01:17:56.430
- What the hell are they doing?

01:17:56.464 --> 01:17:58.708
- Beats the hell outta me,
but I ain't complaining.

01:18:01.538 --> 01:18:03.679
- Shane, Brock, get
in, come on, let's go!

01:18:04.749 --> 01:18:09.443
[guns fire]
[suspenseful music]

01:18:12.791 --> 01:18:15.794
- All right, come on, let's go.

01:18:15.829 --> 01:18:18.866
- Sir, we have a problem.
- I'm not blind!

01:18:18.901 --> 01:18:20.661
- There's corruptions
everywhere.

01:18:21.800 --> 01:18:23.284
It's corrupting
our own databases.

01:18:23.319 --> 01:18:26.736
- They are heading out of
town towards the perimeters.

01:18:26.771 --> 01:18:29.739
[suspenseful music]

01:18:30.947 --> 01:18:32.466

kill switch ready?

[electronics beep]

01:18:35.262 --> 01:18:39.438

- It'll work. I built it!

01:18:39.473 --> 01:18:44.478
- Warning. Warning.
[alarm blares]

01:18:46.652 --> 01:18:49.000
- [Man] Perimeter
warning, 100 yards.

01:18:49.034 --> 01:18:50.518
- We're gonna hit the perimeter.

01:18:50.553 --> 01:18:54.902
- 50 yards. Breach imminent.
- Here goes nothing!

01:18:54.937 --> 01:18:59.769
[electronics beep]
- Perimeter access granted.

[suspenseful music]

01:19:21.273 --> 01:19:23.724
- What are you waiting
for? Seal it up.

01:19:23.759 --> 01:19:25.450
- Hold on.
- Perimeter warning.

01:19:25.484 --> 01:19:27.417
- This can't be happening.

01:19:27.452 --> 01:19:29.419
What are the protocols
we have for this?

01:19:30.386 --> 01:19:31.559

01:19:40.706 --> 01:19:42.605
This was always a
possible outcome.

01:19:43.709 --> 01:19:45.815
- [Man] Perimeter warning.

01:19:45.850 --> 01:19:46.747

01:19:58.448 --> 01:19:59.760
Perimeter warning.

01:19:59.795 --> 01:20:01.279

- [Man] Perimeter warning.

01:20:04.938 --> 01:20:05.801

- The government of the
United States of America

01:20:16.259 --> 01:20:19.228
thanks you for your service.

01:21:01.097 --> 01:21:01.891
- Well?

01:21:04.445 --> 01:21:09.416
It was an honor dragging your
dead weight around. [laughs]

01:21:10.589 --> 01:21:12.695
- Brock, I hope I
never see you again.

01:21:14.697 --> 01:21:15.905
[both laugh]

01:21:15.940 --> 01:21:18.218
- I hate to break
this tender moment up,

01:21:18.252 --> 01:21:19.598
but let's get the
hell outta here.

01:21:41.793 --> 01:21:44.623
