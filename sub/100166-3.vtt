Well, I'm off to give the keynote speech
at the vet conference.

01:06.524 --> 01:08.777
It's gonna be funny and informative.

01:08.860 --> 01:11.071
And an opportunity
to show off my new blouse.

01:12.822 --> 01:14.866
Ooh, what's your big speech about?

01:14.949 --> 01:18.286
Feline fecal impaction
and what your litter box is telling you.

01:21.247 --> 01:22.749
Oh, yeah, I'm laughing already.

01:24.375 --> 01:28.046
-Hey, Jimmy comes home today, right?
-Yeah, but the magazine

01:28.129 --> 01:30.548
has another out-of-town assignment
lined up for him.

01:30.632 --> 01:32.467
Oh, that's great. He's working.

01:32.550 --> 01:35.386
I mean... how dare they employ him?

01:36.930 --> 01:38.598
Wait. Which team am I rooting for?

01:39.849 --> 01:41.768
I don't know. It's-It's just hitting me.

01:41.851 --> 01:43.478
Jimmy's always off on the road,

01:43.561 --> 01:46.064
and Dani and I are at home
waiting for him.

01:46.731 --> 01:49.567
Sometimes I just feel like
I'm doing this all alone.

01:50.151 --> 01:53.238
Well, you're not. I'm always here for you.

01:54.155 --> 01:56.491
Just not today
between the hours of 10:00 and 5:00.

01:58.493 --> 02:01.996
I appreciate that, Deej. I just
really miss Jimmy when he's not home.

02:02.080 --> 02:04.374
Well, Fernando's always home.

02:06.459 --> 02:08.461
I'm really starting
to get worried about him.

02:08.545 --> 02:12.132
Now that the Formula One season
has started, and he's officially retired,

02:12.215 --> 02:15.552
he's lost that spark
that makes him Fernando.

02:15.635 --> 02:18.346
Now he just mopes around in his bathrobe.

02:19.722 --> 02:22.267
Which is weird
'cause he doesn't own a bathrobe.

02:23.393 --> 02:25.770
Well, major life changes are tough,

02:25.895 --> 02:28.356
but I'm sure it's not as bad as you think.

02:34.195 --> 02:35.196

Ethan's Instagram.

03:07.770 --> 03:10.106
What? How did he get on there?

03:12.525 --> 03:14.360
Are you stalking your Postmates guy?

03:15.862 --> 03:19.616
I was just, um, mildly curious
to see what he's into

03:19.699 --> 03:21.951
when he's not driving chimichangas
around the Bay Area.

03:23.578 --> 03:24.996
How far back did you scroll?

03:25.079 --> 03:27.999
Oh, not that far.
Just back to when Instagram was invented.

03:29.042 --> 03:31.169
Hey, I had the same Justin Bieber haircut.

03:33.129 --> 03:34.756
Oh, no. What did you just do?

03:34.839 --> 03:37.175
What? I was just trying to make it bigger.

03:37.926 --> 03:40.303
You just liked a post from ten years ago.

03:41.930 --> 03:44.557
Now Ethan's gonna know
I went deep diving into his feed.

03:45.516 --> 03:48.645
Not to mention he was shirtless
and kissing his grandmother.

03:49.479 --> 03:51.731
He's gonna think
I'm some creepy stalker now.

03:52.523 --> 03:54.817
All because of your pudgy little fingers.

03:55.944 --> 03:59.364
Hey, don't finger-shame me.
My fingers retain water.

04:04.327 --> 04:05.328
Hey, handsome.

04:05.411 --> 04:06.704
Oh. Hi, Mom.

04:07.914 --> 04:10.291
Oh, sorry, honey.
I was talking about Steve.

04:10.375 --> 04:11.626
But you're handsome, too.

04:13.211 --> 04:14.212
Nice try, Mom.

04:16.297 --> 04:17.298
Hi.

04:21.552 --> 04:24.138
Wow. What's got you in such a good mood?

04:24.222 --> 04:27.225
How can I not be in a good mood
looking at your beautiful face?

04:29.477 --> 04:31.354
Oh, right back at you, Steve.

04:34.482 --> 04:36.150
Still not you, Jackson.

04:37.986 --> 04:39.737
Good news. I got the rest of the day off.

04:39.821 --> 04:43.700
I could come to that veterinary conference
and hear you talk about cat butts.

04:44.784 --> 04:47.870
Oh. Yeah, that's okay.
You can skip this one.

04:47.954 --> 04:50.999
Thank goodness. I was gonna
fake a spine injury to get out of it.

04:52.500 --> 04:55.712
Hey, how many times have I
had to listen to your toe-fungus talk?

04:56.546 --> 05:00.383
But you know what?
There is something that I need you to do.

05:00.466 --> 05:02.051
Fernando's been a little down,

05:02.135 --> 05:05.638
and-and some time with a close friend
would mean a lot to him.

05:06.347 --> 05:08.516
I'd be happy to call
one of his close friends.

05:10.268 --> 05:11.978
No, I was talking about you,

05:12.061 --> 05:15.189
because he's always saying that he wishes
he could spend more time with you.

05:15.273 --> 05:16.733
Really?

05:16.816 --> 05:18.192
No. I can't lie.

05:19.902 --> 05:23.406
Look, Fernando is really down,
and Kimmy's worried about him.

05:23.489 --> 05:26.909
Got it. You want me to keep him
in my thoughts and prayers.

05:28.953 --> 05:32.248
Yes, and take him
to Uncle Monty's for a sandwich.

05:32.373 --> 05:35.043
You know, just cheer him up.
Oh, and take Jimmy, too.

05:35.918 --> 05:37.628
Wait. What? Why? Jimmy?

05:38.546 --> 05:42.175
-When did he get thrown in the mix?
-They're both at a career crossroads,

05:42.258 --> 05:45.553
and you're so good
at finding work-life balance.

05:45.636 --> 05:47.430
Maybe you could give 'em some advice.

05:47.513 --> 05:49.515
How many people do I have to help?

05:50.850 --> 05:53.061
Or you could listen to my cat-butt speech.

05:53.144 --> 05:54.562
Oh. My spine.

05:56.314 --> 05:57.732
Okay, fine. Monty's it is.

06:01.235 --> 06:03.821
I prefer dashing paramour, but thank you.

06:04.822 --> 06:08.159
Do you have, like, a job interview
for Goldman Sachs or something?

06:09.202 --> 06:11.079
No. This is my beach bag.

06:16.250 --> 06:18.544
I have specific SPFs
for different parts of the body.

06:19.170 --> 06:21.589
My left leg's a 30
and my right's a 40.

06:21.672 --> 06:22.799
Don't ask me why.

06:23.925 --> 06:27.470
Max is jumping off the high-diving board
at day camp today.

06:27.553 --> 06:30.348
Taylor did it last year,
and he's been insufferable ever since.

06:31.015 --> 06:32.600
Which is supposed to be my thing.

06:33.684 --> 06:37.146
Man, I used to love the high dive,
but, um, just a tip--

06:37.230 --> 06:39.690
double knot the little string
on your bathing suit, okay,

06:39.774 --> 06:41.567
because jumping from
such a great height

06:41.651 --> 06:44.987
has been known to separate a gentleman
from his trunks.

06:47.073 --> 06:48.074
I've heard.

06:49.033 --> 06:50.451
The entire school heard.

06:51.911 --> 06:54.330
And saw. Even the lunch lady
asked him to prom.

06:55.665 --> 06:59.001

but she was a delightful dancer.

that we were gonna do this together,

07:56.225 --> 08:00.229
I assumed that we would do this together
as equal partners.

08:00.938 --> 08:02.648
So you want me to quit my job?

08:02.732 --> 08:05.610

But I need to keep my job
so that I can help support us.

08:19.332 --> 08:22.960
The only way to do that is to be on

It's where I came up with the idea

10:12.528 --> 10:14.238
You invented Ugg boots?

10:14.322 --> 10:17.074
Yeah, but never really
did anything with it.

with a sandwich

10:27.335 --> 10:30.087

I got a capicola

10:36.552 --> 10:38.638
And you were the 50-50.

Half-crab, half-crab salad.

Eggplant Parm. Enjoy.

10:53.277 --> 10:57.531

I ordered a meatball with provolone.

11:00.701 --> 11:03.204
Try the eggplant. Shake things up.

11:06.248 --> 11:08.084
I should shake things up.

11:08.668 --> 11:10.670
I don't want to miss everything
in Dani's childhood,

11:10.753 --> 11:13.673

11:13.756 --> 11:15.633
I too had a passion.

But I gave up racing
to spend more time with my family.

11:22.306 --> 11:24.850
Luckily, I have one remaining passion--

11:25.643 --> 11:27.311
Uncle Monty's sandwiches.

11:27.395 --> 11:31.315
If not for these, my life would be
completely without meaning.

11:32.733 --> 11:34.902
You have a wife and a daughter, right?

11:38.114 --> 11:40.533
-This eggplant is delicious.
-Glad you like it.

11:41.117 --> 11:44.704
It's the last one you're gonna get.
I'm closing down the end of the week.

11:44.787 --> 11:45.913
-What?
-No!

11:45.996 --> 11:48.791
You can't close this place down.
It's an institution.

but their mouths are too full to say it.

Look, the missus says it's too cold,
so I bought her an electric blanket,

11:59.260 --> 12:02.596
and she bought a condo in Florida,
so we're moving to Florida.

12:05.266 --> 12:09.228
This cannot be. These sandwiches
were the small flickering flame

12:09.311 --> 12:10.980

that I went to at the Cow Palace. I was--

12:35.212 --> 12:36.756
You know, never mind. Ahem.

12:38.174 --> 12:40.217
It is nap time. Yeah.

12:40.301 --> 12:42.136
I'll take him. It's my nap time, too.

12:43.053 --> 12:45.389
I'm gonna sleep
until Ethan forgets who I am.

12:47.141 --> 12:48.851
Or till people stop using Instagram.

12:51.937 --> 12:54.565
All right, Steph. Let's talk venues.

12:54.648 --> 12:57.109
No, Kimmy. No more wedding planning, okay?

12:57.193 --> 12:59.445
All right, fine. I won't pester you,

12:59.528 --> 13:02.531
even if it means missing out on
this exquisite reception hall

13:02.615 --> 13:05.868
with seating for 400
and a full view of the Golden Gate.

13:05.951 --> 13:09.622
Ooh. Wow. That is a gorgeous view.

13:10.247 --> 13:11.999
This room is perfect for you.

13:12.082 --> 13:13.667
There's a bar in every corner.

13:15.836 --> 13:18.380
I know. That's-That's the view
I was talking about.

13:20.549 --> 13:21.801
Greetings, ladies.

13:22.343 --> 13:23.344
-Hey.
-[Kimmy] Oh.

13:25.513 --> 13:28.224
Look who's all chipper
and wearing clothes.

13:29.350 --> 13:31.936
Check it out, guys.
We've got something for you. Sit, sit.

13:32.019 --> 13:33.020
Okay.

13:34.313 --> 13:36.023
Ooh, Uncle Monty's?

13:36.941 --> 13:41.070
Yes. I got you both a number 14
with extra peppercini.

13:44.740 --> 13:47.117
Oh. Oh, my God. This is so good.

13:47.952 --> 13:51.872
Number 14, nice to make your acquaintance.
You're even prettier than your picture.

13:54.375 --> 13:55.543
Oh.

13:57.837 --> 13:58.838
Mmm.

14:02.550 --> 14:05.928
This is delicious.
And most of that bite was wrapper.

14:09.306 --> 14:11.392
I could eat this every day.

14:11.475 --> 14:15.062
Oh, funny you should mention that
because, um, what if I told you

14:15.145 --> 14:17.731
you could have Uncle Monty's for free
every day of the week?

14:17.815 --> 14:20.776
I'd say get out my stretch pants
'cause I'm gonna need 'em.

14:22.319 --> 14:23.988
I can't wait any longer!

14:24.071 --> 14:26.407
We bought Uncle Monty's!

14:30.119 --> 14:32.079
We know. We're eating it right now.

14:33.414 --> 14:36.625
Not the sandwich.
We bought the restaurant.

14:40.004 --> 14:42.923
You bought a restaurant
without talking to me first?

14:43.007 --> 14:45.801
W-- Uncle Monty was gonna close the place,

14:45.885 --> 14:49.555
so we decided to save
a Bay Area institution.

14:49.638 --> 14:51.682
We're gonna be kings of cold cuts.

14:53.142 --> 14:54.727
And Steve is the investor,

14:54.810 --> 14:57.605
which makes him the archduke,
also of cold cuts.

14:59.064 --> 15:02.276
But what do either of you
know about running a restaurant?

15:02.359 --> 15:04.737
Okay, I know this may seem
a little hasty and impulsive,

15:04.820 --> 15:06.322
and, boy, was it expensive,

15:06.405 --> 15:10.618
but this way, we can be closer together,
like we both said we wanted.

15:10.701 --> 15:13.913
And I will be here less, like you wanted.

15:15.789 --> 15:19.335
But now we have to go to the bank
to meet Steve

15:19.418 --> 15:21.921
'cause that's what you do
when you run a business.

15:23.505 --> 15:25.215
I think. I don't know.

15:25.299 --> 15:26.634
I've never run a business.

15:29.053 --> 15:31.680
We are gonna learn so much
spending Steve's money.

Ethan will buy that, right?

16:08.801 --> 16:11.261
If he did, would you still
want to go out with him?

16:12.054 --> 16:15.516
No. Why does he have to be
the first smart guy that I like?

16:17.643 --> 16:20.562
Probably for the best.
I was recording my face the whole time.

17:37.347 --> 17:39.308
You know "Torn" is a break-up song?

17:40.017 --> 17:42.144
It's a song about hurting, which I am.

17:43.562 --> 17:45.939
Plus, I couldn't find
a very good diving-board song.

17:48.442 --> 17:49.443

You just climbed down the ladder, right?

18:07.002 --> 18:08.128
I wish.

18:09.004 --> 18:10.297
I was so paralyzed with fear

18:10.380 --> 18:12.925
that the firemen had to get me down
with a cherry picker.

18:15.135 --> 18:17.721
It was humiliating.
Taylor was laughing so hard

18:17.805 --> 18:19.848
that the paramedics
had to give him oxygen.

18:35.948 --> 18:37.699
Dude, deep liking is nothing.

18:38.367 --> 18:42.579
You want to talk public humiliation?
I once fell down the stairs at school.

18:42.663 --> 18:43.622
I knocked over six kids

18:43.705 --> 18:46.750
and a Home Ec teacher
carrying a butter sculpture.

18:46.834 --> 18:49.837
And when I tried to get up,
I kept slipping on the butter.

18:51.380 --> 18:54.591
I made the local news. For months,
I was known as the Hot Buttered Boy.

18:56.552 --> 18:59.388
-But now here's the embarrassing part...
-Please stop.

19:00.305 --> 19:02.432
What Jackson's trying to say is...

19:02.516 --> 19:05.227
he's lived an entire life
of abject humiliation,

19:05.310 --> 19:06.854
and he's still plugging away.

19:08.147 --> 19:12.109
Yep, I wake up every day thinking,
"Today cannot be worse than yesterday."

19:14.111 --> 19:15.904
Do you really think I can do this?

19:17.072 --> 19:18.490
You won't know until you try.

19:20.325 --> 19:23.871
You're right. If Jackson
can show his face in school,

19:23.954 --> 19:27.374
then I can go right back down to camp
and jump off that high dive.

19:28.834 --> 19:30.460
Thanks, Hot Butter Boy.

bought Uncle Monty's sandwich shop

20:00.866 --> 20:02.075
without telling us.

20:02.159 --> 20:05.037
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
They-They bought Uncle Monty's?

20:05.120 --> 20:07.039
Yeah, when they were at lunch with Steve.

20:07.122 --> 20:11.168
What were those three guys doing together?
They've never hung out in their lives.

20:15.672 --> 20:17.174

20:17.299 --> 20:19.843
That is an unlikely trio. I...

20:21.929 --> 20:25.015
So they didn't just have lunch
and solve each other's problems?

20:25.807 --> 20:28.268
Who said anything about having lunch
or solving problems?

20:29.353 --> 20:30.979
Not me, that's for sure.

20:32.606 --> 20:35.192

something I would say.

20:35.275 --> 20:36.985
Oh, I can't lie. Okay.

20:37.069 --> 20:40.072
It sounds exactly like
something I would say because I said it.

20:41.406 --> 20:44.618
I knew they needed a smart person
to come up with a stupid idea.

20:46.411 --> 20:48.664
Look, all I did was suggest
they have lunch,

20:48.747 --> 20:50.415
not buy a sandwich shop.

20:51.458 --> 20:53.752
But, you know,
the guys are pretty resourceful.

20:53.835 --> 20:57.506
And Monty's is a popular place.
Maybe they'll make a go of it.

20:57.589 --> 21:01.343
Oh, I'm glad you're onboard
'cause Steve's the primary investor.

because I've never been in
a healthy relationship.

and give 'em advice."

Well, that's what I did, but then
this opportunity presented itself.

that Uncle Monty's is gonna be all ours?

is the solution to all of our problems.

gets diagnosed with high cholesterol.

And, um... I'm selling him the RV.

25:57.347 --> 25:59.057
What? But you love that RV.

25:59.849 --> 26:01.476
You said you wanted to be buried in it.

26:01.560 --> 26:04.271
And ten minutes ago,
I was ready to oblige you.

26:06.356 --> 26:08.358
I'm doing it to pay my share.

26:08.441 --> 26:11.611
I'm a dad now,
and I want to be a responsible adult.

26:12.320 --> 26:14.489
You and Danielle
are all that matter to me now.

26:16.116 --> 26:17.325
That is so sweet.

26:18.743 --> 26:21.580
Let's go deposit that check
before he finds out the water pump's bad.

26:21.663 --> 26:22.622
Oh, yeah.

26:26.293 --> 26:30.005
Hey. Are you sure you're okay
being in business with these guys?

26:30.088 --> 26:32.924
Sure. They need somebody
with business experience.

26:33.717 --> 26:36.595
You are so sweet to help them out.

26:36.678 --> 26:38.805
You are a good man, Dr. Hale.

26:39.681 --> 26:42.809
And besides, with the amount of money
I'm gonna spend on sandwiches,

26:42.892 --> 26:44.811
this place is gonna make a killing.

26:47.314 --> 26:48.315
Oh, dear.

26:55.905 --> 26:59.284
So, Deej, your first
Uncle Monty's sandwich. Any thoughts?

27:00.535 --> 27:03.413
Well, my question isn't,
"Why did you buy Uncle Monty's?"

27:03.496 --> 27:06.041
It's, "Why didn't you buy
Uncle Monty's sooner?"

27:09.711 --> 27:14.090
Max. Hey, Jackson and Ramona
told me about your rough morning.

27:14.174 --> 27:16.384
-How'd it go back at camp?
-It was great.

27:16.468 --> 27:19.721
-So you finally went off the high dive?
-Not even close.

27:21.014 --> 27:24.100
I tried multiple times,
but self-preservation finally won out.

27:26.061 --> 27:27.937
Wait. So what was so great about it?

27:28.021 --> 27:31.691
Well, Taylor did go off the high dive,
and he lost his bathing suit midair.

27:33.860 --> 27:37.739
So everybody was so busy laughing at him
that they forgot all about me.

27:39.908 --> 27:41.451
Good for you, honey.

27:42.327 --> 27:44.204
I mean, poor Taylor.

27:45.497 --> 27:47.248
[whispers] But good for you, honey.

27:48.458 --> 27:52.253
Whoa, Ethan just deep-liked
a third-grade class picture of me.

27:52.337 --> 27:53.713
You know what this means?

27:54.756 --> 27:56.466
That he's a creepy stalker, too?

27:57.300 --> 27:59.969
Exactly. We're made for each other.
