<i>Someone check on hell</i>

00:17.308 --> 00:21.271
<i>Devi Vishwakumar just walked</i>
<i>into school for the first time</i>

00:21.354 --> 00:23.815
<i>as Paxton Hall-Yoshida's girlfriend.</i>

00:23.898 --> 00:26.026
<i>And all she had to do was cheat on him,</i>

00:26.109 --> 00:29.029
<i>hit him with the car,</i>
<i>and do all his homework.</i>

00:29.779 --> 00:32.157
<i>Harry and Meghan, move over.</i>

00:32.240 --> 00:34.659
<i>This is what fairy tales are made of.</i>

00:35.952 --> 00:36.786
What the hell?

00:36.870 --> 00:39.831
<i> They'd been together</i>
<i>for two whole weeks,</i>

00:39.914 --> 00:43.501
<i>which for teenagers is basically</i>
<i>a lifetime of monogamy.</i>

00:44.377 --> 00:45.670
<i>Although between us,</i>

00:45.754 --> 00:49.257
<i>it had been a surprisingly</i>
<i>PG-13 two weeks.</i>

00:54.804 --> 00:56.473
Uh, maybe not tonight?

00:57.057 --> 00:58.850
Uh-- I had a huge dinner.

00:58.933 --> 01:00.143
-Okay.

01:02.437 --> 01:04.355
How about we watch some TikToks?

01:09.319 --> 01:11.279
Hey, let's take a rain check.

01:11.362 --> 01:14.449
-I actually had a huge breakfast.
-Okay.

01:15.950 --> 01:18.703
-Uh, let's watch some TikToks.
-Cool.

01:19.412 --> 01:21.372
<i>And though unusually large meals</i>

01:21.456 --> 01:24.459
<i>had interfered with the consummation</i>
<i>of their love,</i>

01:24.542 --> 01:26.628
<i>Devi was Paxton's official girlf.</i>

01:28.088 --> 01:31.508
<i>And for the first time,</i>
<i>she was feeling truly confident.</i>

01:33.676 --> 01:36.888
You guys, isn't it crazy
that Paxton and Devi are together?

01:36.971 --> 01:39.349
-I know, right? I never saw that coming.

01:39.432 --> 01:42.435
She's dying, right?
It's like a deathbed, last wishes thing?

01:42.519 --> 01:44.479
God, Paxton is just so kind.

01:44.979 --> 01:47.941
No, that's what I thought,
but she's like, healthy.

01:48.024 --> 01:49.317
Maybe she's just a huge slut.

01:49.400 --> 01:51.111
-Of course.
-Good observation.

01:51.194 --> 01:53.488
Thanks. I'm really good
at deductive reasoning.

01:53.571 --> 01:56.991
Yeah, the only reason a guy like Paxton
would be with a freak like Devi

01:57.075 --> 01:58.118
is if she puts out.

01:58.201 --> 02:01.371
-Totally.
-No other logical explanation.

02:01.454 --> 02:04.124
Do you guys think I could pull off
white contacts like Kanye?

02:04.207 --> 02:05.375
-Yes!
-Totally!

02:10.463 --> 02:13.633
The debut of Daxton was unreal.

02:13.716 --> 02:17.303
The hallway was littered with backpacks
people dropped in shock.

02:17.387 --> 02:18.221
It was awesome.

02:18.304 --> 02:21.808
Yeah, and you made it onto Lady Whistleboy
for the first time ever.

02:21.891 --> 02:24.853
<i>Lady Whistleboy</i>
<i>was the school's gossip TikTok</i>

02:24.936 --> 02:27.480
<i>loosely based on a </i>Bridgerton<i> character</i>

02:27.564 --> 02:30.150
<i>run by a not so anonymous source.</i>

02:30.817 --> 02:34.529
Are you guys banging yet? I can't wait
to read Lady Whistleboy's take on that.

02:34.612 --> 02:36.114
Uh, we're circling it.

02:36.197 --> 02:38.575
We both want to. It's imminent for sure.

02:39.868 --> 02:41.077
Look up.

02:42.745 --> 02:44.414
-Oh shit!

02:45.540 --> 02:48.877
Uh…
What's going on with you and Trent?

02:48.960 --> 02:51.296
That failed attempt to look cool
was directed right at you.

02:51.379 --> 02:54.591
Ugh! I mean, we hung out a couple of times
over Christmas break.

02:54.674 --> 02:57.385
My parents definitely hate him,
which is exciting.

02:57.468 --> 02:59.387
Star-crossed lovers is your dream.

02:59.470 --> 03:01.848
I know, but it's so confusing.

03:01.931 --> 03:03.308
We haven't kissed yet,

03:03.391 --> 03:06.269
but he did leave a little bag
of weed under my Christmas tree.

03:06.352 --> 03:07.937
What do you guys think that means?

03:08.021 --> 03:09.856
Uh, that seems romantic to me.

03:09.939 --> 03:11.149
<i>Uh, no, it does not!</i>

03:11.232 --> 03:13.818
What up, losers?
What's good in the kingdom of rejects?

03:15.403 --> 03:17.947
Sorry. Still getting used
to having female friends.

03:18.448 --> 03:21.743
-Hi. Hello. Good morning. What's goin' on?
-Hey, babe.

03:21.826 --> 03:23.244
We're just congratulating Devi

03:23.328 --> 03:25.455
on her mic drop
of an entrance with Paxton.

03:25.538 --> 03:28.708
-Oh, uh, I guess I missed it. Sounds cool.

03:28.791 --> 03:29.792
It did, right?

03:29.876 --> 03:32.629
Because we're a good couple?
Like, it's believable that we're together,

03:32.712 --> 03:36.132
and one person wouldn't have to be a whore
to make the other like them, right?

03:36.216 --> 03:38.301
Devi, you're overthinking it.

03:38.384 --> 03:40.261
And you know what?
I just thought of something.

03:40.345 --> 03:42.639
Depending on how
this Trent thing shakes out,

03:42.722 --> 03:44.974
we might all be in legit relationships.

03:45.058 --> 03:47.685
-Here's to never being single again.

03:47.769 --> 03:50.104
Fabiola, I need to talk to you.

03:51.856 --> 03:53.191
I'm so sorry.

03:53.274 --> 03:55.193
You're moving to Korea?

03:55.276 --> 03:57.862
<i> Eve's mom</i>
<i>was opening a franchise of Bar Method</i>

03:57.946 --> 03:59.239
<i>in Seoul, South Korea.</i>

03:59.322 --> 04:02.700
<i>It was her dream to teach Korean women</i>
<i>how to sculpt their butts</i>

04:02.784 --> 04:04.702
<i>with small repetitive movements.</i>

04:04.786 --> 04:06.913
-I don't want to break up.
-Neither do I.

04:06.996 --> 04:09.374
Okay, then let's do long distance.
It shouldn't be that hard.

04:09.457 --> 04:11.209
-What's the time difference?
-Sixteen hours.

04:11.292 --> 04:13.253
What? Damn.

04:13.336 --> 04:17.465
Maps really don't do
the Pacific Ocean justice, but it's fine.

04:17.548 --> 04:19.759
We can do this.
I'll just stay up a little later.

04:19.842 --> 04:22.553
You can FaceTime me when you're home
from school. It's gonna be okay.

04:25.848 --> 04:28.768
Good morning, <i>Pati.</i> Can I help with that?

04:28.851 --> 04:30.728
Oh, now you want to help out?

04:30.812 --> 04:33.815
I was under the impression
that all you do at mealtime

04:33.898 --> 04:35.483
is run away and shame your family.

04:35.566 --> 04:37.068
<i>Pati,</i> please, the knife.

04:37.151 --> 04:39.612
The knife is the least of your worries.

04:39.696 --> 04:41.281
I have never been so humiliated.

04:41.364 --> 04:44.701
Not even the time when my sari got caught
in the escalator at the Beverly Center.

04:44.784 --> 04:47.578
I was half naked
in front of Bath & Body Works.

04:47.662 --> 04:50.081
<i>Pati,</i> you know how sorry I am.

04:50.164 --> 04:52.792
I've texted Prashant many times,
but he won't respond.

04:52.875 --> 04:54.419
What did you even say?

04:54.502 --> 04:57.213
"Oh, hey, boo.
Sorry to have abandoned you."

04:57.297 --> 04:59.257
"Hope we're cool. Sad face emoji."

04:59.340 --> 05:01.759
If you weren't so beautiful,
I would have slapped you.

05:01.843 --> 05:05.013
Okay, Kamala,
why don't you leave the kitchen

05:05.096 --> 05:07.598
while your grandmother's furious…
and armed?

05:07.682 --> 05:09.183
You did bring disgrace on your family,

05:09.267 --> 05:11.519
but I don't think
that's a stabbable offense.

05:11.602 --> 05:13.021
I would go quickly if I were you.

05:19.068 --> 05:19.902
Hey.

05:20.403 --> 05:21.821
Oh. Hey.

05:21.904 --> 05:24.782
So, I haven't seen you much recently,
and I--

05:25.283 --> 05:28.453
Wait, why are there so many photos
of Adele in your locker?

05:28.536 --> 05:31.289
Because she's an icon
with the voice of an angel, bro.

05:31.372 --> 05:34.167
-You have a problem with that?
-No, no. I love Adele.

05:34.250 --> 05:35.376
She's cool.

05:35.460 --> 05:37.462
-So what do you want?

05:38.004 --> 05:40.131
Are you, like, pissed at me
because I'm with Devi?

05:40.214 --> 05:42.258
It's not anger, man.

05:42.342 --> 05:43.593
It's fear.

05:43.676 --> 05:45.511
I've seen this girl burn you once.

05:45.595 --> 05:47.388
It's like Adele's song "Cold Shoulder."

05:47.472 --> 05:50.183
"Time and time again,
you're going to play the fool."

05:50.266 --> 05:52.602
-I don't know that song.
-Yeah, well, you freaking should.

05:53.227 --> 05:57.273
I just worry about you, man. I know behind
those sculpted abs is a tender heart.

05:57.357 --> 05:59.525
My heart's not behind my abs.

05:59.609 --> 06:01.861
Oh, sure it is.
You're just afraid to see it.

06:03.112 --> 06:07.200
Listen, man. I appreciate
that you're looking out for me, all right?

06:07.283 --> 06:09.619
But I really do trust Devi this time.

06:09.702 --> 06:15.458
Okay, if you trust her,
then what else can I do but also trust.

06:17.335 --> 06:19.170
-Psych!
-Dude!

06:19.253 --> 06:21.381
Whatever, man.
Your nuts miss me. I could tell.

06:24.342 --> 06:25.927
-Hey, Devi.
-Yo.

06:27.095 --> 06:30.348
-Hey, ready to hit the road?
-Totally. Let's roll.

06:30.431 --> 06:31.265
Cool.

06:31.349 --> 06:32.850
<i>The walk out of school</i>

06:32.934 --> 06:36.145
<i>was feeling a bit less triumphant</i>
<i>to Devi than the walk-in.</i>

06:36.729 --> 06:40.983
<i>She had been obsessing over what Shira,</i>
<i>Zoe, and Carley had said all day.</i>

06:41.067 --> 06:45.905
<i>Was everyone wondering why Paxton</i>
<i>was with someone so far beneath him?</i>

06:45.988 --> 06:48.699
<i>What did Paxton and Devi</i>
<i>even look like to them?</i>

06:50.451 --> 06:54.205
<i>The newest odd couple at</i>
<i>Sherman Oaks High is leaving the building!</i>

06:58.126 --> 06:59.961
Here are some snacks
I found in my car.

07:00.044 --> 07:01.629
Sorry, they're mostly crushed.

07:02.213 --> 07:03.297
Oh, thank God.

07:03.381 --> 07:05.383
Can you please talk to <i>Pati?</i>

07:05.466 --> 07:08.469
I know she's disappointed with me,
but surely she doesn't want me to starve.

07:08.553 --> 07:12.640
Uh, I wouldn't put it past her. She did
almost try to decapitate you this morning.

07:12.723 --> 07:14.809
So, do you love him?

07:15.309 --> 07:16.269
This teacher?

07:16.853 --> 07:20.731
-I don't know what you're talking about.
-Devi's English teacher, Mr. Kulkarni.

07:20.815 --> 07:23.109
The one you went to see
at the school that night.

07:23.192 --> 07:24.735
I'm not dumb, Kamala.

07:24.819 --> 07:27.488
He asked about you
at Devi's parent-teacher conference.

07:27.572 --> 07:30.950
And then he pretended he asks
about all his students' cousins.

07:31.451 --> 07:33.453
No, I don't love him.

07:34.078 --> 07:36.122
Manish is just a friend.

07:36.205 --> 07:37.331
Look, Kamala.

07:38.207 --> 07:41.127
I know this way
of getting married can seem scary.

07:41.210 --> 07:43.337
Things may seem out of your control,

07:43.421 --> 07:46.674
but you just have to look
at your parents or look at Mohan and me.

07:46.757 --> 07:49.218
I mean, part of the reason
why we worked is because

07:49.302 --> 07:51.804
our families just went into it
wanting the same things.

07:51.888 --> 07:53.055
I know. Uh…

07:54.223 --> 07:55.558
I'm just scared.

07:56.517 --> 07:58.853
I love my life here, my freedom.

07:58.936 --> 08:00.188
I don't feel ready.

08:00.271 --> 08:04.275
I was a third-year medical student
when my parents matched me up with Mohan.

08:04.358 --> 08:06.777
All I wanted to do was zap spider veins

08:06.861 --> 08:10.656
and buy myself a white BMW convertible
with gold rims.

08:10.740 --> 08:12.867
-I did not have great taste back then.

08:12.950 --> 08:15.411
I mean, the last thing
I wanted to do was to get married.

08:15.495 --> 08:17.705
So, what changed your mind?

08:18.498 --> 08:22.835
Mohan, you know,
he was so honest and so kind,

08:22.919 --> 08:26.589
and when we moved here
he made me feel closer to my family,

08:26.672 --> 08:29.217
even though we were thousands
of miles away.

08:31.219 --> 08:32.136
He was my rock.

08:33.596 --> 08:36.766
Prashant does remind me of home.

08:36.849 --> 08:37.850
It's nice.

08:37.934 --> 08:40.144
Listen, no one's making you
get married tomorrow,

08:40.228 --> 08:43.773
but I don't think you should
throw away Prashant because you're scared.

08:43.856 --> 08:44.982
And he's so hot.

08:45.066 --> 08:47.485
Extremely hot.
If you don't marry him, I will.

08:55.034 --> 08:55.952
When you insisted

08:56.035 --> 09:00.039
we throw you a Happy Boyfriend party today
during our session,

09:00.122 --> 09:02.708
I thought you'd be happier about it.

09:02.792 --> 09:04.669
Yeah, I know.

09:05.336 --> 09:06.712
Wait, I don't understand.

09:06.796 --> 09:08.631
You're dating the boy of your dreams.

09:08.714 --> 09:11.884
He's publicly acknowledged you
as his girlfriend. Ooh!

09:11.968 --> 09:12.969
Wait a minute.

09:13.052 --> 09:17.139
Did we discover that being
in a romantic relationship

09:17.223 --> 09:20.017
doesn't necessarily solve
all of our problems?

09:20.101 --> 09:22.061
Mmm. Nice try, Dr. Ryan.

09:22.144 --> 09:24.814
The entire Olivia Rodrigo album
would disagree with you.

09:25.439 --> 09:26.816
Then why are you so down?

09:26.899 --> 09:31.237
I overheard some girls say that
I must be a slut for Paxton to like me.

09:31.320 --> 09:33.447
And not slut like
in the cool, affectionate way

09:33.531 --> 09:35.366
gay men say it on reality shows.

09:35.449 --> 09:38.077
Like, it's the only possible explanation
for why we're together.

09:38.160 --> 09:41.122
Devi, I am so sorry that happened to you.

09:41.205 --> 09:44.458
Me too. This cake cost $60,
and I'm too upset to eat it.

09:44.542 --> 09:48.045
Sixty dollars!
Girl, why you didn't just go to Ralphs?

09:48.129 --> 09:50.464
Listen, in life,

09:50.548 --> 09:55.428
there's always going to be some girl
in a bathroom calling you a slut, right?

09:55.511 --> 09:59.515
But the trick is
you don't let somebody else define you.

09:59.599 --> 10:02.560
When you do that,
you give them your power.

10:03.519 --> 10:05.271
Yeah, you're right.

10:05.354 --> 10:08.399
That's hella wise, Doc.
I'm gonna go bitch those girls out.

10:08.482 --> 10:11.611
You think I want you
to go bitch some other children out?

10:11.694 --> 10:12.987
-Yeah.
-No!

10:13.696 --> 10:15.656
I want you to ignore them.

10:16.532 --> 10:18.409
So, do absolutely nothing?

10:18.993 --> 10:23.039
Absolutely nothing is
an exercise in restraint.

10:23.914 --> 10:25.625
I see. Take the high road.

10:25.708 --> 10:27.376
-Yes.
-Sure. I could totally do that.

10:27.460 --> 10:31.339
Good, because it would be
very mature of you.

10:31.422 --> 10:34.425
It would be, and that is why
I'm going to do exactly that.

10:34.508 --> 10:36.135
I'm sure you will.

10:36.761 --> 10:39.847
Guess what, you jealous bitches. I heard
what you said about me in the bathroom.

10:39.930 --> 10:43.225
About your insane clothes?
You look like a children's performer.

10:43.309 --> 10:45.353
I do not look like a children's perform--

10:46.771 --> 10:49.690
Okay, there are a lot of primary colors.

10:49.774 --> 10:53.736
Anyways, I am not a slut,
and for your information,

10:53.819 --> 10:55.321
Paxton and I have not had sex.

10:55.404 --> 10:57.782
He likes me
for my awesome personality. I'm--

10:57.865 --> 11:00.368
-Whoa, you and Paxton haven't had sex yet?

11:00.451 --> 11:03.120
-No.
-Great. That means he'll be single soon.

11:03.204 --> 11:04.246
Huh?

11:04.330 --> 11:06.207
Sweetie, Paxton's not gonna stay
with someone

11:06.290 --> 11:07.583
who's not having sex with him.

11:07.667 --> 11:11.128
He's like a man. He got armpit hair
when we were in fourth grade.

11:11.212 --> 11:14.256
Yeah, he's not gonna be satisfied
by only touching boobs

11:14.340 --> 11:16.634
and watching quirky TikToks
in bed or whatever.

11:16.717 --> 11:20.471
<i>Aw, shit, Devi.</i>
<i>That's exactly what you and Paxton do.</i>

11:20.554 --> 11:23.641
Ooh. Maybe he'll ask me to prom.
You guys want to look at dresses?

11:23.724 --> 11:25.017
-Yes.
-REVOLVE app.

11:25.101 --> 11:27.144
Oh my God, that is so cute.

11:27.228 --> 11:29.563
So, you want to go to dinner this weekend?

11:29.647 --> 11:33.234
Yeah, like heat up your mom's leftovers
and play <i>Fortnite </i>in your garage

11:33.317 --> 11:34.610
with Trent and Marcus? Sure.

11:34.694 --> 11:37.446
-Damn. Is that what our dates are like?
-Mm-hmm.

11:37.530 --> 11:38.531
That sucks.

11:39.115 --> 11:42.618
No, like a real date, like romantic.

11:43.202 --> 11:45.204
Have you ever been to CPK?

11:45.287 --> 11:48.624
<i>CPK?</i>
<i>Aka California Pizza Kitchen?</i>

11:48.708 --> 11:52.586
<i>Only the preeminent fast-casual</i>
<i>pizza chain in the US?</i>

11:52.670 --> 11:55.506
<i>Now that's a date. I wish I could go.</i>

11:55.589 --> 11:58.134
Yeah, sure. I love pizza.

11:58.217 --> 12:03.180
So, am I bringing a Lactaid for later,
or am I just going home after?

12:03.806 --> 12:06.809
I mean, we could hang out
at my house after if you want.

12:06.892 --> 12:09.895
Hmm. Great, great. Lactaid it is.

12:11.814 --> 12:16.736
<i>If Devi was popping Lactaids</i>
<i>and hanging out with Paxton after a meal,</i>

12:16.819 --> 12:18.821
<i>that only meant one thing.</i>

12:20.030 --> 12:22.116
I'm gonna have sex
with Paxton this weekend.

12:22.199 --> 12:23.701
Oh my--

12:25.244 --> 12:29.081
I was waiting for Fabiola to say God,
but I think she's asleep.

12:29.582 --> 12:33.419
Fab. Hello! You're like snoozing during
the most important news you've ever heard!

12:33.502 --> 12:36.505
Sorry. I was up late talking
to Eve in Seoul.

12:36.589 --> 12:38.674
I don't know
how much more I can take of this.

12:40.551 --> 12:42.553
Hey, guess what? I could burp your name.

12:44.263 --> 12:45.473
Eleanor.

12:48.517 --> 12:51.103
Well, that was sort of sweet, I guess.

12:51.187 --> 12:53.105
<i>Devi's head was swimming.</i>

12:53.189 --> 12:56.859
<i>She was with the hottest boy in school,</i>
<i>and it was becoming clear to her</i>

12:56.942 --> 13:00.362
<i>that certain sexual expectations</i>
<i>went along with that.</i>

13:00.446 --> 13:04.992
<i>Thank God she could just disappear into</i>
<i>a normal class and not think about it.</i>

13:16.504 --> 13:18.214
Good morning, young scholars.

13:18.297 --> 13:22.551
Get your draft cards ready
because today we start our unit on…

13:24.845 --> 13:25.805
the Vietnam War.

13:25.888 --> 13:30.184
This is a story
about an incredibly rash decision

13:30.267 --> 13:32.645
that ended in devastating consequences.

13:33.229 --> 13:35.564
<i>We bowed down to pressure from others,</i>

13:35.648 --> 13:37.858
not because it was the right thing to do,

13:37.942 --> 13:40.569
but because of our own precious egos.

13:40.653 --> 13:43.322
<i>However, soon we realized</i>
<i>we were in over our heads,</i>

13:43.405 --> 13:47.576
<i>and our actions left us with nothing</i>
<i>but embarrassment and shame.</i>

13:47.660 --> 13:50.788
And by the time we pulled out,
our innocence was lost.

13:50.871 --> 13:54.917
Blood was everywhere.

13:56.502 --> 13:59.463
-That's right, Devi. It is gasp-worthy.

13:59.964 --> 14:01.465
Your homework assignment.

14:02.341 --> 14:04.093
Listen to the <i>Forrest Gump</i> soundtrack.

14:04.176 --> 14:07.805
At least to the mid-'70s
before Jenny gets into heroin.

14:09.223 --> 14:12.184
Hey, Mr. Shapiro, another inspiring class.

14:12.268 --> 14:14.144
I actually felt like
I was at the fall of Saigon.

14:14.228 --> 14:16.105
Thank you. That was my goal.

14:16.772 --> 14:19.650
Did you happen to get my email
requesting additional extra credit?

14:19.733 --> 14:22.778
I did. Uh, unfortunately,
the answer is no.

14:23.362 --> 14:24.697
What? Why?

14:24.780 --> 14:27.157
To be honest, you've already got
an A-triple-plus in my class.

14:27.241 --> 14:29.660
If I go any higher, I'll need permission
from the school board.

14:29.743 --> 14:31.579
Mr. Shapiro, I know that an A-triple-plus

14:31.662 --> 14:33.581
seems like a good grade
for someone who went to…

14:34.164 --> 14:35.082
Sarah Lawrence.

14:35.165 --> 14:38.252
Of course,
but I am trying to get into an Ivy

14:38.335 --> 14:41.797
with an incredibly small acceptance rate,
so I need a little help here.

14:43.257 --> 14:45.175
As insulting as this interaction has been,

14:45.259 --> 14:47.219
I'm gonna have to stick
with my original decision.

14:47.303 --> 14:49.680
-No more extra credit, Ben.
-Ugh.

14:50.264 --> 14:54.310
And Sarah Lawrence has a 53%
acceptance rate. It's pretty competitive.

14:57.438 --> 14:58.814
Damn, that was crazy.

14:58.898 --> 15:02.526
I know. Mr. Shapiro should be begging
to grade my extra credit assignments.

15:02.610 --> 15:04.069
My prose is freaking lyrical.

15:04.153 --> 15:06.780
No, I meant you. You were the crazy one.

15:06.864 --> 15:07.781
Me?

15:07.865 --> 15:10.701
You have to be intense about grades
if you want to go to a good college.

15:10.784 --> 15:13.579
Okay, wait. Have you not thought
about where you want to go to college?

15:14.163 --> 15:17.458
Not really. I figured I'd just go to
Cal State Northridge where my cousins go.

15:18.375 --> 15:23.339
Wow. Well, I want to go to Columbia
like Barack Obama and Jake Gyllenhaal.

15:23.422 --> 15:25.716
We had our Bar Mitzvahs
at the same temple.

15:25.799 --> 15:28.302
Jake and me, not President Obama.

15:28.385 --> 15:30.930
Ah. Sounds cool.
Maybe I'll apply there too.

15:32.765 --> 15:33.724
What?

15:37.519 --> 15:40.648
-Kamala?
-Hi. I brought cashew brittle.

15:41.231 --> 15:44.026
It's delicious, and it's on
the pricier end of their offerings.

15:44.109 --> 15:45.861
I have a deadly nut allergy.

15:45.945 --> 15:48.781
Was your purpose to kill me after
humiliating me in front of my family?

15:49.698 --> 15:51.200
Prashant, wait.

15:51.283 --> 15:53.118
I am so sorry.

15:53.744 --> 15:54.578
I just panicked.

15:55.204 --> 15:58.457
My grandmother and my aunt convinced me
that you were going to propose.

15:58.540 --> 15:59.917
I was going to propose.

16:00.501 --> 16:01.543
-You were?
-Yeah.

16:01.627 --> 16:04.296
Why do you think I brought
my parents here? To see Universal Studios?

16:04.380 --> 16:06.507
They've been to the better one in Orlando.

16:06.590 --> 16:08.884
-Oh.
-Why are you here, Kamala?

16:09.802 --> 16:10.928
To win you back?

16:11.929 --> 16:13.931
I don't think you actually want me back.

16:14.014 --> 16:16.600
Sure, I do. You're such a great catch.

16:16.684 --> 16:17.518
I know I am.

16:17.601 --> 16:20.312
But, apparently, the thought
of me proposing to you made you flee.

16:20.396 --> 16:21.563
I'm ready for marriage.

16:21.647 --> 16:24.274
I want to take that next step
and to have a family.

16:24.358 --> 16:25.693
And I thought you did too.

16:25.776 --> 16:29.363
I do theoretically,
but I still have my fears.

16:29.446 --> 16:32.116
Honestly, I didn't love the advice
you gave me about my work.

16:32.199 --> 16:34.868
And I worry that that means
you won't support me professionally.

16:34.952 --> 16:37.788
And sometimes, when I picture our wedding,
I feel physically ill.

16:37.871 --> 16:40.290
But that doesn't mean
that I want to lose what we have.

16:40.958 --> 16:43.377
From what you just told me,
I don't think we have anything.

16:43.460 --> 16:44.795
No, that's not true.

16:45.379 --> 16:48.132
I mean, we have terrific sexual chemistry.

16:48.757 --> 16:50.551
I would agree with that.

16:51.218 --> 16:54.722
Okay, look, maybe it's true that
I don't necessarily want to marry you,

16:54.805 --> 16:58.767
but it might just be
that I don't want to marry anyone.

16:59.727 --> 17:02.438
Well, then it's probably better
that we know that now.

17:03.147 --> 17:04.023
Goodbye, Kamala.

17:09.445 --> 17:11.822
I can't believe
I'm gonna lose my virginity tonight.

17:11.905 --> 17:14.533
Okay, and we assume
you've already called the PTA meeting.

17:14.616 --> 17:15.617
PTA meeting? What's that?

17:16.618 --> 17:18.162
Pits, tits, and ass.

17:18.245 --> 17:19.580
You gotta keep it fresh in there.

17:19.663 --> 17:21.790
<i>God, I hate knowing</i>
<i>that acronym.</i>

17:21.874 --> 17:23.834
Yes, my PTA are squeaky clean.

17:23.917 --> 17:27.296
I wiped them down with old alcohol wipes
from when I got barbecue take out.

17:27.379 --> 17:30.257
It hurt like a bitch,
but thanks for helping me get ready, guys.

17:30.340 --> 17:31.800
It really means a--

17:31.884 --> 17:33.343
Fab! What the hell?

17:33.427 --> 17:35.929
Congratulations on doing sex.
We are so proud of you.

17:36.013 --> 17:39.475
Dude, you can't keep doing this
long-distance thing. It's not healthy.

17:39.558 --> 17:40.809
Yes, I can.

17:40.893 --> 17:44.229
I love Eve, and it'll be so worth it
when I can visit her in 60 months

17:44.313 --> 17:46.398
after I've saved up my allowance
for airfare.

17:46.482 --> 17:49.193
Mm-hmm. I don't know, guys. It's weird.

17:49.276 --> 17:53.614
I'm obviously mega horny for Paxton,
but kissing to intercourse in two weeks?

17:53.697 --> 17:55.115
Isn't that kind of fast?

17:55.199 --> 17:58.035
So don't have sex with him.
I'm not having sex with Ben.

17:58.118 --> 17:59.953
<i>Oh, that's interesting.</i>

18:00.037 --> 18:03.207
<i>Not to me personally,</i>
<i>but for this group of girls.</i>

18:03.290 --> 18:05.751
Devi, you don't have to do it
if you aren't ready.

18:05.834 --> 18:07.878
But Shira, Zoe, and Carley said

18:07.961 --> 18:11.090
that Paxton won't stay with a girl
who doesn't have sex with him.

18:11.173 --> 18:13.008
Don't listen to them.
They don't know anything.

18:13.092 --> 18:14.384
Thanks, Fab.

18:14.468 --> 18:16.595
Even if they're right,
what's the worst that can happen?

18:16.678 --> 18:20.099
Paxton dumps you, and your popularity
plummets into the toilet again.

18:20.182 --> 18:23.227
So what?
Isn't your integrity more important?

18:23.310 --> 18:26.980
Also, many sexless people
have very fulfilling lives.

18:27.064 --> 18:30.067
They just channel their extra energy
into other pursuits.

18:30.150 --> 18:31.944
Like, you could raise bees.

18:32.027 --> 18:33.946
Raise bees?

18:34.029 --> 18:36.240
Gonna be honest, guys,
this advice low-key sucks.

18:36.907 --> 18:39.660
Sorry. I don't know why
I'm freaking out.

18:39.743 --> 18:41.495
I've wanted to have sex
with Paxton forever,

18:41.578 --> 18:43.831
and it's probably gonna be
some magical deflowering

18:43.914 --> 18:45.833
that I write a poem about or some shit.

18:46.333 --> 18:47.167
I'm gonna do it.

18:47.251 --> 18:50.379
Yes, queen! And now,
the most important question.

18:50.462 --> 18:51.839
What is your panty situation?

18:51.922 --> 18:54.091
Mmm. Boy shorts
with <i>South Park</i> characters on it.

18:54.174 --> 18:55.676
The fly is Cartman's mouth.

18:57.469 --> 18:59.638
Right. I know how to fix this.

19:02.349 --> 19:04.768
Ooh la la.

19:05.727 --> 19:06.854
What are you doing?

19:07.396 --> 19:08.397
Uh…

19:08.897 --> 19:09.940
Your laundry.

19:10.023 --> 19:12.609
I know that's a lie. You don't even know
where the washer/dryer is.

19:12.693 --> 19:13.694
Uh, yeah, I do.

19:14.319 --> 19:17.114
I want to say… kitchen?

19:18.157 --> 19:19.283
Okay. Fine.

19:19.366 --> 19:23.120
I needed to borrow some sexy underwear
because I'm dating someone.

19:23.203 --> 19:24.997
Yes, Paxton. I know.

19:25.080 --> 19:27.541
I've run into him a few times
in our Jack and Jill bathroom.

19:27.624 --> 19:30.043
You're lucky your mom doesn't know
that you're dating him.

19:30.127 --> 19:31.461
Wait, why do you need…

19:32.337 --> 19:33.422
Oh my God, Devi.

19:35.174 --> 19:36.508
Are you going to have sex?

19:36.592 --> 19:38.218
-Is he pressuring you?
-No.

19:38.302 --> 19:41.722
-I want to. I'm excited about it.
-Uh-huh.

19:42.347 --> 19:43.765
Sit down. Let's talk.

19:45.601 --> 19:47.227
Devi, sex is a big deal.

19:47.311 --> 19:50.939
When you sleep with someone,
you're the most vulnerable you'll ever be.

19:51.023 --> 19:54.276
And if you rush into that,
you could get really hurt.

19:54.860 --> 19:56.445
Like, down there?

19:56.528 --> 19:58.822
No, Devi, like, emotionally.

19:58.906 --> 20:00.324
Ah.

20:00.407 --> 20:01.617
I've learned the hard way

20:01.700 --> 20:04.578
that you shouldn't do anything
on anyone's schedule but your own.

20:04.661 --> 20:06.455
Are you talking about Prashant?

20:07.039 --> 20:07.915
Yes.

20:08.415 --> 20:11.084
I'm not going to marry him
because I'm not ready.

20:11.168 --> 20:14.254
And you shouldn't have sex yet
unless you're ready.

20:14.338 --> 20:17.549
<i>The problem was,</i>
<i>Devi, like most teenagers,</i>

20:17.633 --> 20:19.718
<i>had no idea what she was ready for.</i>

20:19.801 --> 20:22.930
<i>All she knew was that she was</i>
<i>certainly not ready to be dumped.</i>

20:23.472 --> 20:24.806
I'm not trying to be mean.

20:24.890 --> 20:27.851
I'm just saying I've never seen
anyone eat that much pizza.

20:27.935 --> 20:31.438
It's almost like you were trying to stall
before you were coming home with me.

20:32.731 --> 20:34.233
Stall? Are you crazy?

20:34.316 --> 20:35.525
Why would I want to delay

20:35.609 --> 20:37.819
the momentous night
we have ahead?

20:51.625 --> 20:54.836
-Ow. Ow, ow. My ear, my ear! Ow, ow.
-Oh, oh, oh.

20:56.129 --> 20:57.214
You good?

20:57.297 --> 20:58.966
Yeah.

20:59.049 --> 21:02.052
Totally good. Don't know why I decided
to wear statement earrings.

21:11.019 --> 21:11.853
I'm ready.

21:16.483 --> 21:18.443
I'm ready.
Just put it in and get it over with.

21:23.198 --> 21:24.741
-Paxton?

21:26.618 --> 21:28.078
Hey, wha-- what's up?

21:28.662 --> 21:29.579
Why'd you stop?

21:30.455 --> 21:32.249
I'm so close.

21:32.332 --> 21:34.960
Devi, your hands were
in tight little fists.

21:35.043 --> 21:38.630
And you were so stressed out,
I think I heard you crack a tooth.

21:39.298 --> 21:40.465
Wha-- Um…

21:42.050 --> 21:45.137
I don't think I'm ready to have sex.

21:46.346 --> 21:48.348
I understand if you want
to break up with me.

21:48.432 --> 21:51.476
I know you don't date girls
who don't put out, so it's cool.

21:52.102 --> 21:54.521
That's not true. I can go slow.

21:55.522 --> 21:58.317
Okay, but what does going slow
mean to you?

21:58.400 --> 22:00.819
Like non-stop 69ing?
'Cause I don't want to do that.

22:00.902 --> 22:02.487
What? No.

22:05.490 --> 22:08.577
Look, Devi, I only want to do
what you're comfortable with.

22:09.369 --> 22:12.706
Well, what if what I'm comfortable with

22:12.789 --> 22:15.625
is just going to second base
during scary movies?

22:16.376 --> 22:18.253
-Then I'm cool with that.
-Really?

22:18.962 --> 22:19.963
Yeah.

22:21.590 --> 22:24.092
-You want to watch some TikToks?
-Yeah.

22:26.345 --> 22:28.013
So we decided to take it slow.

22:28.096 --> 22:30.599
He didn't even get to see the G-string
I made out of my shoelace.

22:30.682 --> 22:32.893
-That's awesome, Devi.
-Good for you.

22:32.976 --> 22:36.355
I mean, we did silkscreen
this "Plowed by Paxton" t-shirt for you,

22:36.438 --> 22:40.233
but I guess I can give it to someone else
who had sex with him. I'm proud of you.

22:40.317 --> 22:42.944
Apricot conditioner, so no flaking.

22:43.028 --> 22:44.738
So, any updates on Trent?

22:45.572 --> 22:49.534
Ugh! No, I've given up on him.
He ghosted me on text.

22:49.618 --> 22:51.787
-I guess I misread the signals.

22:51.870 --> 22:55.874
Here are your graded pop quizzes
on the Tet Offensive.

22:55.957 --> 23:00.921
And, frankly, what I find offensive
is how ill-prepared so many of you were.

23:01.004 --> 23:04.216
I guess I'll have to go back
to teaching with textbooks

23:04.299 --> 23:06.510
instead of the films of Robert Zemeckis.

23:07.677 --> 23:08.804
I got a flat 100?

23:08.887 --> 23:12.557
But I wrote an extra page
on LBJ's inability to de-escalate the war

23:12.641 --> 23:15.685
and Lady Bird Johnson's lack
of fashion compared to Jackie O's.

23:15.769 --> 23:17.437
I told you, Ben, no more extra credit.

23:18.355 --> 23:20.941
An 82? A freaking 82?

23:21.024 --> 23:24.152
Hey, I also got an 82! Ha! We're the same.

23:24.236 --> 23:27.114
-Eleanor, up top!

23:27.614 --> 23:31.451
I don't know how this happened.
I've never gotten below an A before.

23:32.035 --> 23:35.497
<i> In that moment,</i>
<i>Fabiola knew what she had to do.</i>

23:38.125 --> 23:40.043
<i> Hey, I think we should talk.</i>

23:42.003 --> 23:44.423
<i>Sure,</i>
<i>would30 a.m. your time work?</i>

23:45.465 --> 23:48.135
Ooh, an 84. Suck on that, Trent.

23:57.352 --> 23:58.270
Eleanor!

24:00.105 --> 24:02.732
How could you leave me
hanging back there with my high five?

24:03.442 --> 24:05.610
It cuts me deep
that my girl would do that to me.

24:05.694 --> 24:08.238
Um, I'm sorry. Your girl?

24:08.321 --> 24:09.489
Are we dating?

24:09.573 --> 24:11.450
Because you haven't texted me back
in forever.

24:11.533 --> 24:13.743
Oh, that's because I changed my number.

24:13.827 --> 24:16.830
I found out that 1-800-0FS-GIVEN
became available.

24:16.913 --> 24:18.415
Not that I even give an f.

24:18.999 --> 24:22.377
Okay, so just to clarify,
you have a toll-free cell phone number?

24:22.461 --> 24:24.504
-Yeah.
-And you like me?

24:24.588 --> 24:25.422
Romantically?

24:25.505 --> 24:26.423
Yeah.

24:27.007 --> 24:29.759
Okay, because that wasn't
really clear before.

24:29.843 --> 24:32.512
Oh, well, let me be clear then.

24:46.276 --> 24:47.527
-Wow.
-Sick.

24:50.947 --> 24:52.449
-Hey.
-Hi.

24:53.200 --> 24:54.868
Well, how's everything going?

24:54.951 --> 24:56.161
The, you know…

24:59.331 --> 25:00.999
Things are really good.

25:02.167 --> 25:04.753
Good. Since you're a late bloomer,

25:04.836 --> 25:06.671
I just wanted to offer my advice

25:06.755 --> 25:09.841
as someone with more romantic
and sexual experience.

25:09.925 --> 25:12.219
-Mmm. How kind of you.
-Yeah, no problem.

25:13.386 --> 25:16.598
Great, well, all right.
I'll, uh, see you later, David.

25:16.681 --> 25:17.807
Mmm.

25:20.727 --> 25:22.020
Hey! You three!

25:22.687 --> 25:26.525
I want to let you guys know that Paxton
and I decided to take things slow

25:26.608 --> 25:30.278
because we are in a mature,
committed, respectful relationship

25:30.362 --> 25:32.197
that the three of you
would never understand.

25:33.031 --> 25:36.243
What? We didn't hear you
because we had in our earbuds.

25:37.327 --> 25:41.122
I was just saying that Paxton and I
are taking things slow, and we're good.

25:42.499 --> 25:43.625
Okay.

25:44.167 --> 25:47.504
It's just that you said some
pretty mean stuff about us before, so…

25:47.587 --> 25:49.839
-I don't think so. Doesn't sound like us.
-Mm-mm.

25:49.923 --> 25:51.049
No, you definitely did.

25:51.132 --> 25:52.801
She said we're not mean.

25:52.884 --> 25:55.220
And you labeling us that
makes you a bully.

25:55.303 --> 25:57.889
The prettiest girls at school
are always the ones people bully.

25:57.973 --> 25:59.349
Mm-hmm.

25:59.432 --> 26:02.185
<i>Right then</i>
<i>Devi learned a valuable lesson.</i>

26:02.269 --> 26:04.104
<i>She was nothing to these girls.</i>

26:04.187 --> 26:07.399
<i>So maybe what they said</i>
<i>should mean nothing to her.</i>

26:08.525 --> 26:11.069
Thank you.
I got a lot out of this conversation.

26:11.152 --> 26:12.737
-Great chat.
-Bye.

26:12.821 --> 26:13.989
-Great stuff. Bye.
-Bye.

26:15.323 --> 26:19.077
So, Devi, how was your evening last night?
Was it eventful?

26:20.745 --> 26:23.790
It was not. I did not consummate my plans.

26:23.873 --> 26:26.543
What is this?
Why are you both talking weird?

26:26.626 --> 26:27.752
Nothing, Mom.

26:28.336 --> 26:30.589
-Yo! We got idli and sambar? Noice!
-Mm-hmm.

26:30.672 --> 26:32.257
That definitely sounds more normal.

26:32.340 --> 26:35.969
So, Nirmala <i>Mami,</i> how was
your water aerobics class this morning?

26:36.052 --> 26:38.638
You still floating away,
or did you find a way to anchor yourself?

26:38.722 --> 26:39.639
Nobody cares, Nalu.

26:39.723 --> 26:41.933
Kamala, did you talk to Prashant?

26:42.475 --> 26:43.935
Is the wedding on or not?

26:44.019 --> 26:47.647
Because we need to start booking flights
for family coming from India.

26:48.148 --> 26:51.943
I did speak to Prashant.
It was an illuminating conversation,

26:52.027 --> 26:55.363
and I think we came to a mutual agreement
which we are both very happy with.

26:56.489 --> 26:59.117
We have decided
to not move forward with our relationship.

26:59.993 --> 27:02.454
But I think it's going to be
a positive thing for me, because--

27:02.537 --> 27:06.833
Oh, you do? I'm glad to hear it,
because I'm never speaking to you again.

27:07.959 --> 27:11.296
Devi, you are
my only granddaughter now. Enjoy.

27:14.299 --> 27:15.300
All right, <i>Mami…</i>

27:15.383 --> 27:17.135
<i>Okay, well,</i>
<i>things were looking up.</i>

27:17.218 --> 27:20.388
<i>Devi was somehow,</i>
<i>for the first time, the family favorite.</i>

27:20.472 --> 27:23.558
<i>She was in a healthy relationship</i>
<i>with her dream guy,</i>

27:23.642 --> 27:25.935
<i>and she had learned</i>
<i>to ignore all the haters.</i>

27:26.978 --> 27:28.605
<i>You better watch out, Devi.</i>

27:28.688 --> 27:31.316
<i>Paxton Hall-Yoshida</i>
<i>is not who you think he is.</i>

27:31.900 --> 27:34.986
<i>Yeah,</i>
<i>it's gonna be hard to ignore that.</i>
