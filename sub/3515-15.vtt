00:00.960 --> 00:02.007
NICK: Previously on Grimm...

00:02.080 --> 00:05.607
Someone outside the family
is carrying royal blood.

00:05.680 --> 00:08.570
WOMAN: What do you suppose a
royal offspring would be worth?

00:08.640 --> 00:09.926
But we must trust each other,

00:10.000 --> 00:12.002
or there will be no stopping
the royal families.

00:12.080 --> 00:13.730
They will dominate
the world again.

00:13.800 --> 00:15.450
I want you to get to
Adalind before they do.

00:15.520 --> 00:16.560
You must leave immediately.

00:16.600 --> 00:17.601
You didn't get her?

00:17.680 --> 00:19.808
Someone tipped them
off, and they escaped.

00:19.880 --> 00:22.531
WOMAN: Someone close to you
has betrayed us both.

00:22.600 --> 00:23.681
Hey, you're gonna be okay.

00:23.760 --> 00:25.125
Aswang.

(GROWLS)

00:26.560 --> 00:27.561
(SCREAMING)

00:29.360 --> 00:31.283
Now that we know what we're
dealing with, what do we tell Wu?

00:31.440 --> 00:34.125
We can't risk involving him in
something that he doesn't understand.

00:34.280 --> 00:35.805
But we can't let him
think he's going crazy.

00:36.000 --> 00:37.047
I know what I saw!

00:42.120 --> 00:44.122

(STRAINED GRUNTS)

(EXHALES SHARPLY)

00:58.920 --> 01:01.571
Hold on. Hold on,
give me that light.

01:05.120 --> 01:07.202
There's not supposed
to be a room here.

01:07.960 --> 01:09.246
Look at that.

01:10.520 --> 01:13.330
MAN: We better get somebody
from the university down here.

01:16.000 --> 01:17.684
Careful, watch your step.

01:22.320 --> 01:25.164
WOMAN: SS Phaedra, 1946.

01:25.240 --> 01:28.767
Athens, Cairo, Malta, New York.

01:28.840 --> 01:30.490
MAN: You want
us to open it?

01:31.480 --> 01:32.481
Yes!

01:36.000 --> 01:37.126
(CREAKING)

01:53.160 --> 01:54.685
Here, help me open it

01:59.040 --> 02:01.805
Oh, my...

02:02.400 --> 02:03.401
God.

02:22.360 --> 02:23.600
HANK: I still think
we should tell him.

02:23.680 --> 02:25.045
You saw how he was.

02:25.120 --> 02:27.168
Even if we wanted to tell
him, he is not ready.

02:27.240 --> 02:29.208
All I know is after I
faced my first beast...

02:29.280 --> 02:31.806
Whoa, Hank, we're right here.

02:32.000 --> 02:33.047
Sorry.

02:33.120 --> 02:34.167
My first Wesen.

02:35.280 --> 02:37.851
Not that some Wesen aren't
more bestial than others.

02:37.920 --> 02:39.251
Don't get me wrong.

02:39.440 --> 02:40.520
You saw how messed up I was.

02:40.560 --> 02:42.085
Put a few bullet
holes in the closet,

02:42.160 --> 02:43.730
couldn't sleep
without my shotgun,

02:43.800 --> 02:46.565
but once Nick explained
things, and you did too...

02:47.600 --> 02:50.251
Took some getting used
to, but here I am.

02:50.320 --> 02:53.563
That's because Nick was your partner.
You already trusted him.

02:53.640 --> 02:56.041
Yeah, I mean, if I hadn't
already been connected

02:56.120 --> 02:58.361
to Nick's world and loved
him and trusted him,

02:58.440 --> 03:00.044
I don't know what my
reaction would have been.

03:00.120 --> 03:02.282
Yeah, but your life's a lot better
now that you know, isn't it?

03:02.520 --> 03:05.808
It's better with Nick,
but if I wasn't with Nick,

03:05.880 --> 03:08.201
I'm... I'm just not
so sure I'd wanna know.

03:08.400 --> 03:11.802
Like most people, Wesen
is not for everybody.

03:11.920 --> 03:14.969
It's one thing seeing a
Fuchsbau or even a Blutbad,

03:15.040 --> 03:16.246
but an Aswang?

03:16.320 --> 03:18.482
I mean, they scare even us.

03:18.560 --> 03:20.324
If that was your
introduction to Wesen

03:20.400 --> 03:22.448
and then you were told
you're not imagining things,

03:22.520 --> 03:24.170
that could fry your brain.

03:24.240 --> 03:26.766
I mean, I know I'm
repeating myself here,

03:26.840 --> 03:28.205
but it could fry
your brain for good.

03:28.280 --> 03:29.645
ROSALEE: I have to agree.

03:29.800 --> 03:32.849
I think we should wait and see
how Wu responds to treatment.

03:33.080 --> 03:34.161
Maybe he'll be okay.

03:38.360 --> 03:39.361
What if he's not?

03:44.400 --> 03:45.481
Then we have to tell him.

03:47.080 --> 03:48.161
Originally, it was discovered...

03:48.240 --> 03:49.526
MAN: Not right.
It's not right.

03:49.600 --> 03:51.967
They have no respect.
It's unholy!

03:52.040 --> 03:54.884
What do you expect from
people who desecrate graves?

03:54.960 --> 03:58.248
You've called this discovery momentous.
Can you tell us why?

03:58.640 --> 04:01.769
Usually, a sarcophagus
depicts a pharaoh

04:01.840 --> 04:04.081
or some other
important personage

04:04.160 --> 04:05.650
carved on the surface,

04:05.720 --> 04:07.609
but this depicts an Anubis...

04:08.280 --> 04:10.248
An Egyptian god of the dead.

04:10.560 --> 04:13.006
Well, now that it's up,
we do it, right?

04:13.720 --> 04:15.563
Yeah. We do it.

04:16.360 --> 04:19.363
Well, we've waited 70 years to
see your 3, 000-year-old mummy.

04:19.440 --> 04:20.646
We can wait a little longer.

04:20.720 --> 04:22.290
This is Suzanne Li reporting

04:22.360 --> 04:25.011
from the new home of the
mummy at the university.

04:25.720 --> 04:27.051

05:27.480 --> 05:28.561
We got it.

05:31.720 --> 05:32.721
Let's get it out of here.

05:32.800 --> 05:34.529
Not before I do this.

MAN OVER WALKIE TALKIE: I heard gunshots.
What's going on up there?

07:37.800 --> 07:43.443
Then the Aswang would flick its
long black tongue and eat the baby.

07:44.600 --> 07:47.649
No... Er, actually,
no, not at first.

07:50.800 --> 07:54.521
It would insert its tongue into
the pregnant woman's stomach

07:54.600 --> 07:56.523
and suck out the amniotic fluid,

07:56.600 --> 07:58.489
and then it would eat the baby.

07:59.880 --> 08:02.531
What else did your grandmother
tell you about the Aswang?

08:04.360 --> 08:06.727
The Aswang has sharp claws.

08:07.040 --> 08:12.251
It can climb walls and trees
and get you anywhere you are.

08:13.000 --> 08:14.411

08:15.800 --> 08:17.484
Can we talk some more
about your experience

08:21.200 --> 08:24.921
(SIGHS) Yeah. Sure. What
would you like to know?

You said other people were
there, but they didn't see it.

How do you explain that?

08:31.080 --> 08:34.208
What I saw felt real.

08:35.280 --> 08:37.965

but we have a homicide.

a homicide in the morning.

Yeah, you're starting
to sound like you.

We'll be back soon, okay?

10:16.840 --> 10:19.081
Hope it'll be to take me home.

10:19.160 --> 10:21.128
COP: The cabinets
were spray painted.

10:21.200 --> 10:23.806
We got one campus security
dead and another one wounded.

10:23.880 --> 10:26.281
One of 'em attacked the campus
cop who shot the other one.

10:26.760 --> 10:28.444
Now that's the cop's gun there.

10:28.520 --> 10:30.249
He dropped it in the fight.

10:30.320 --> 10:31.526
How's he doing?

10:31.880 --> 10:34.247
He's pretty messed up about
his partner getting killed.

10:34.360 --> 10:36.160
Was he able to get a look
at who attacked him?

10:36.440 --> 10:38.169
Sort of, I guess.

10:38.280 --> 10:39.725
He said he looked like that.

10:39.880 --> 10:42.042
It was dark. Figured he must
have been wearing a mask.

10:45.920 --> 10:47.001
And also, the cop said that

10:47.080 --> 10:49.845
the lid to the sarcophagus was
open, but it's closed now.

10:49.960 --> 10:52.167
Nothing in his pockets,
no wallet.

10:52.240 --> 10:54.447
Have CSU run his prints
when they get here.

10:55.000 --> 10:56.525
Got two shell casings here.

10:56.600 --> 10:58.204
9 mil, same as the cop's gun.

10:58.280 --> 11:01.489
Could be the dead
guy or his buddy

11:01.560 --> 11:04.882
grabbed the other cop's gun, shot
this cop coming through the door.

11:04.960 --> 11:06.007
Worst thing that can happen...

11:06.080 --> 11:07.520

to shoot somebody.

11:07.920 --> 11:09.200
Doubt they keep
any cash in here.

11:09.240 --> 11:11.322
Maybe they broke in
to steal the computers.

11:11.440 --> 11:12.805
Why'd they open the sarcophagus?

11:13.240 --> 11:15.004
Curiosity.
Yeah.

11:15.080 --> 11:16.127
I'd be curious.

come in here.

check the sarcophagus.

about to take a look.

Thank God it
hasn't been damaged.

11:41.960 --> 11:45.328
That's a kind of strange
shape for a mummy, isn't it?

11:45.520 --> 11:47.045
We haven't started
our examination yet.

11:47.120 --> 11:49.043
It could be a deformed human

11:49.120 --> 11:52.329
or some sort of manufactured
religious artifact.

11:52.440 --> 11:54.124
CT scan will let
us know for sure.

11:54.200 --> 11:55.725
Until then, let's close it.

11:56.280 --> 11:58.123
HANK: Any idea what those
painted symbols mean?

12:00.920 --> 12:02.729
"I protect the dead."

12:03.640 --> 12:04.846
Mean anything to you?

12:04.920 --> 12:07.810
It's part of an inscription
found in Tutankhamun's tomb.

12:07.880 --> 12:09.325
Some people think
of it as a curse.

12:09.960 --> 12:11.007
What do you consider it?

12:11.080 --> 12:13.447
I just want my lab back.
I have a lot of work to do.

12:13.520 --> 12:15.280
As soon as we're done
with the investigation.

12:15.400 --> 12:16.845
Okay.

12:25.840 --> 12:27.683
You think the mummy walked?

12:28.000 --> 12:30.685
Oh, I don't know.
What do you think?

12:30.760 --> 12:32.330
I hope not.

12:42.440 --> 12:43.680

12:43.760 --> 12:45.524
Yes. Sit.

12:58.280 --> 12:59.850

It's Armagnac.
It's very good.

13:04.960 --> 13:06.041
You're gonna need it.

13:08.720 --> 13:10.290
Have I done something wrong?

13:10.360 --> 13:14.126
Actually, yes, but it's not
too late to make it right.

13:14.200 --> 13:17.443

the names of all your friends

13:17.560 --> 13:19.050

13:35.080 --> 13:36.525
Just got confirmation
from Interpol.

13:36.600 --> 13:38.568
Karl John Herman, 27.

13:38.680 --> 13:42.321
Dual Swiss-US citizenship.
His prints were on the gun.

13:42.400 --> 13:43.811
That means Karl
Herman's our killer.

13:43.880 --> 13:45.291
NICK: Well, he is on
the terrorist watch list.

13:45.360 --> 13:48.648
Wanted for arson,
theft, and homicide.

13:48.720 --> 13:51.246
He targets museums,
breaks in, leaves graffiti

13:51.320 --> 13:53.129
protesting the
desecration of the dead.

13:53.200 --> 13:55.123
Could explain his interest
in the sarcophagus.

13:55.200 --> 13:57.168
Campus cop said
whatever attacked him

13:57.240 --> 13:59.163
looked like what was
carved on the sarcophagus.

14:00.240 --> 14:03.767
The mummy inside is also
in the shape of an Anubis.

14:03.840 --> 14:06.081
So you think it's
possible that it's Wesen,

14:06.160 --> 14:08.401
fully Woged,
mummified, and alive?

14:08.480 --> 14:09.527
Probably not.

14:09.600 --> 14:11.841
But we do think that Karl
Herman could be Wesen.

14:12.520 --> 14:14.090
Same kind as the mummy.

14:14.320 --> 14:15.651
That's a hell of a connection.

14:15.720 --> 14:17.051
Strong family ties?

14:17.120 --> 14:18.963
Well, let's try to untie them.

14:30.760 --> 14:32.285
What the hell's
taking you so long?

14:33.920 --> 14:37.606
Yeah, I know, but mistakes happen.
It couldn't be helped.

14:38.760 --> 14:40.649
Tonight. I'm gonna
do it tonight.

14:42.560 --> 14:44.085
"How" is not your problem.

14:44.720 --> 14:46.802
Just be ready.

15:20.360 --> 15:21.964
How the hell did you get here?

15:31.400 --> 15:32.481
What have you done?

15:32.560 --> 15:33.971
What are you talking about?

15:34.040 --> 15:35.451
Your baby.

15:35.640 --> 15:37.130
She's right here.

15:37.960 --> 15:39.405
But it's freezing in here.

15:39.480 --> 15:40.720
The fire went out,
and there's no wood left.

15:40.800 --> 15:42.689
I saw her.
I picked her up.

15:42.840 --> 15:44.604
She's been with me all night.

15:47.520 --> 15:48.965
I could hear her heartbeat.

15:50.040 --> 15:51.041
(SPEAKING GERMAN)

15:51.120 --> 15:52.201
What's wrong?

15:53.680 --> 15:56.729
It sounds like
a second heartbeat.

15:57.560 --> 16:00.006
I'm... having twins?!

16:01.560 --> 16:04.211
Not that I can see.

16:04.840 --> 16:06.683
I swear I was
holding her in my arms.

16:07.160 --> 16:08.650
How is that possible?

16:08.800 --> 16:10.040
(FIRE CRACKLES)

16:13.840 --> 16:16.241
ADALIND: I think she's the
only one who can answer that.

16:19.080 --> 16:21.162
MONROE: That is
definitely not Kehrseite.

16:21.400 --> 16:24.290
Is it even possible to mummify
a Wesen in full Woge?

16:24.360 --> 16:25.521
MONROE: I guess so.

16:25.600 --> 16:27.648
I mean, if the Wesen
were kept alive

16:27.720 --> 16:30.246
in a heightened state
of fear or agitation.

16:30.320 --> 16:33.005
And if the right drugs were
used to preserve the Woge.

16:33.120 --> 16:35.160
But once it's mummified,
it couldn't wake up, right?

16:35.200 --> 16:36.770
No, when you're dead,
you're dead.

16:36.880 --> 16:38.803
So this is a mummified Anubis.

16:39.080 --> 16:40.764
It could be.

16:40.840 --> 16:42.683
Hence the carving
on the sarcophagus.

16:42.760 --> 16:43.886
Anubis are Wesen?

16:43.960 --> 16:45.246
I was just going to ask that.

16:45.320 --> 16:48.005
Lots of Egyptian
gods were Wesen.

16:48.080 --> 16:50.560
That's why we're depicted
as animal-like creatures

16:50.640 --> 16:51.880
on the tomb walls.

16:51.960 --> 16:56.602
Way back when, Wesen were
actually, well, worshiped.

16:56.680 --> 17:00.605
Tefnut, Ammut, Bast, Khepri.

17:01.080 --> 17:03.970
Total rock stars.
Literally.

17:04.040 --> 17:06.088
The campus cop said he was
attacked by something

17:06.160 --> 17:08.731
that looked like an Anubis,
so they're still around.

17:08.839 --> 17:10.365
Well, yeah, they're not extinct,

17:10.440 --> 17:12.640
if that's what you're thinking,
but it wasn't this dude.

17:12.680 --> 17:14.170
He'd be dead.

17:14.240 --> 17:16.446
So then there had to be
another Anubis in the room.

17:16.520 --> 17:21.731
Yeah, well, this one is a cold-blooded
killer with a political message.

17:22.319 --> 17:25.449
Sorry, I'm not really
up on my hieroglyphs.

17:25.520 --> 17:27.329
You... You know
what this says?

17:27.440 --> 17:28.771
"I protect the dead."

17:29.400 --> 17:30.481
Beati Paoli.

17:30.560 --> 17:31.800
Beati Paoli, right.

17:37.160 --> 17:39.766
But you really think
nowadays, around here?

17:39.840 --> 17:42.366
Somebody wanna tell us
what this Beati Paoli is?

17:43.160 --> 17:46.562
It's a Sicilian vendetta society
made up of different Wesen,

17:46.640 --> 17:49.166
dedicated to the protection
of Wesen culture.

17:49.400 --> 17:52.131
Yeah, it was created
in the 17th century.

17:52.200 --> 17:54.806
They go after, like,
museums, archeological digs,

17:54.880 --> 17:56.450
antique auction houses.

17:56.520 --> 17:58.170
They'll even go after
private Wesen collectors

17:58.240 --> 18:00.607
if they're trafficking in
stolen Wesen antiquities.

18:00.680 --> 18:04.162
ROSALEE: Growing up, every angry young
Wesen wanted to join their cause.

18:04.240 --> 18:06.208
And I'm not saying I
condone their methods,

18:06.280 --> 18:10.205
but if this mummy really
is Wesen, I have to agree,

18:10.280 --> 18:13.045
displaying it Woged
is totally grotesque.

18:13.120 --> 18:15.487
It's immoral.
It's a sacrilege.

18:15.560 --> 18:18.245
This mummy is not only
a part of our heritage.

18:18.320 --> 18:19.526
It's our ancestor.

18:20.160 --> 18:24.051

of passionate about this.

18:24.120 --> 18:25.929
Well, I guess it's
time we hit the trailer.

18:26.040 --> 18:27.520

MONROE: Oh, yeah.

18:27.560 --> 18:31.007
Love to, but our
wedding planner's coming,

18:31.080 --> 18:34.402
so this tall guy
is stuck with me.

18:35.920 --> 18:37.046
Sorry.

18:40.640 --> 18:42.369
Oh, hey, it's not
gonna be so bad.

18:42.440 --> 18:44.568
No, that's not what I was thinking.
It's just...

18:46.760 --> 18:49.445
Maybe we should inform the
Council about what's happened.

18:49.840 --> 18:51.808
No. It's been
all over the news.

18:51.880 --> 18:53.530
I'm sure they would
have heard it by now.

18:53.880 --> 18:56.008
Besides, if it
really is the Beati Paoli,

18:56.080 --> 18:57.844
the less we're involved,
the better.

18:58.240 --> 18:59.401

No.

I'm glad you came.

26:53.680 --> 26:58.163
Look, I... I've kind of been
through something similar.

26:58.920 --> 27:00.331
When I was in the hospital,

27:00.400 --> 27:01.640
all that time after I got out,

27:01.720 --> 27:05.805
I had horrible
nightmares and dreams.

27:05.880 --> 27:08.121
Do you remember the night that
I fired the gun in the house?

27:08.200 --> 27:09.565
Oh, yeah.

27:09.640 --> 27:11.483
There was some crazy stuff
going on in my head.

27:11.600 --> 27:13.409
Yeah, I thought Nick was
gonna lose his mind

27:13.480 --> 27:14.970
'cause you
couldn't remember him.

27:15.040 --> 27:16.769
And then when my memory
did start coming back,

27:16.840 --> 27:20.640
I thought for sure
I was seeing ghosts.

27:27.400 --> 27:28.526
Really?

27:29.880 --> 27:31.006
I didn't know that.

27:31.400 --> 27:33.084
It scared the hell out of me.

27:35.600 --> 27:39.321
I couldn't see it clearly,
but it was so real.

27:41.440 --> 27:44.205
It was your memory coming back.

27:45.400 --> 27:46.561
Yeah.

27:49.040 --> 27:50.644
Did the ghosts go away then?

27:50.920 --> 27:53.321
Once I realized what it was,

27:53.440 --> 27:57.764
but when it was happening,
I was living in a nightmare.

27:58.920 --> 28:01.571
But how did you ever

28:01.640 --> 28:04.849
get past the feeling that
what you saw was real?

28:06.960 --> 28:10.123
I decided it didn't really matter
whether it was real or not.

28:10.200 --> 28:11.964
I had to lose my fear of it.

28:14.080 --> 28:15.411
And then what happened?

28:18.440 --> 28:19.805
I got better.

28:24.880 --> 28:26.291
Glad you're here.

28:26.400 --> 28:27.890
Are you okay?
Yeah.

28:29.400 --> 28:30.731
Thank you for coming.

28:30.800 --> 28:32.325
I wish I could say the same.

28:33.640 --> 28:34.801
How long have you been here?

28:34.880 --> 28:36.245
Oh, a couple hours.

28:37.960 --> 28:39.325
I need your help.

28:40.200 --> 28:41.486
Really?

28:42.120 --> 28:44.441
I didn't know you
asked Grimms for help.

28:45.000 --> 28:48.004
Depends on the circumstances
and the Grimm.

28:49.600 --> 28:51.602
Well, what is it you think
that I can do for you?

28:52.000 --> 28:53.445
The Beati Paoli.

28:53.560 --> 28:54.686
You've heard of them?

28:54.760 --> 28:55.807
I have.

28:56.120 --> 28:58.851
Are you aware that the man
you're after is a member?

28:58.920 --> 29:00.570
Karl Herman.
Yes.

29:00.640 --> 29:03.769
Look, I don't care what group
he belongs to. He's a murderer.

29:05.080 --> 29:08.766
We don't condone what
the Beati Paoli does,

29:08.840 --> 29:11.161
but we also don't
usually get in their way.

29:12.000 --> 29:14.367
We also feel strongly
that Wesen remains

29:14.480 --> 29:16.323
should not be put on display.

29:16.520 --> 29:19.729
It's disrespectful and dangerous
to the Wesen community.

29:20.960 --> 29:24.362
But by killing the guard,
he's gone too far.

29:24.720 --> 29:26.484
The Council wants him stopped.

29:27.600 --> 29:29.648
If you came here to kill him,

29:30.000 --> 29:31.365
I'm just gonna
tell you right now,

29:31.440 --> 29:32.726
I'm not gonna let that happen.

29:32.800 --> 29:34.211
We know.

29:34.680 --> 29:37.047
That's why the Council
wants you to stop him,

29:38.520 --> 29:40.887
which is why I'm going
to tell you what I know.

29:41.440 --> 29:44.046
Karl Herman will
make another attempt.

29:44.160 --> 29:45.400
And you know this how?

29:45.480 --> 29:46.891
Because he called the Council

29:46.960 --> 29:49.042
and asked for help in
stealing it tonight.

29:49.760 --> 29:50.807
What did you tell him?

29:50.880 --> 29:53.963
That he's violated Council law
by killing the Kehrseite,

29:54.040 --> 29:55.963
which is a capital crime.

29:57.280 --> 29:58.611
You want me to kill him.

29:58.720 --> 29:59.881
You're a Grimm.

30:00.880 --> 30:02.689
That's what you do.

30:02.760 --> 30:05.411
I'm not going to
execute him for the Council.

30:05.520 --> 30:08.251
He needs to be dealt with soon.

30:08.520 --> 30:11.763

Professor Gates for her help,

30:11.840 --> 30:13.888
whether or not she's
willing to give it.

30:15.880 --> 30:18.247
Yes, you don't have much time.
Neither do I.

The Council asking
a Grimm to kill a Wesen?

30:34.080 --> 30:35.684
Yeah, that was
a little unnerving.

likes how it turned out

sent Alexander here,

the crap out of the guy.

31:11.280 --> 31:13.487
that Karl Herman's
gonna try again tonight,

31:13.600 --> 31:15.728
and he's gonna use
Professor Gates to do it.

get the plates off Alexander's car?

31:18.840 --> 31:21.571

we need to know where he is.

showing up here tonight?

showing up here tonight.

to get to Professor Gates' house.

38:18.000 --> 38:20.207
We think he came here just to
make sure you stopped this guy?

38:20.280 --> 38:21.725
No.
Me either.

38:37.840 --> 38:40.684
Still warm.
They can't have got far.

38:41.240 --> 38:42.366
(GRUNTING)

39:00.760 --> 39:02.046
How much further?

39:02.120 --> 39:04.487
We need to keep moving.
We're almost there.

39:19.560 --> 39:20.721
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

39:21.480 --> 39:23.130
I hope you've got Alexander.

39:23.240 --> 39:24.890
MONROE: We're looking
right at him.

39:24.960 --> 39:26.166
NICK: The Anubis?

39:26.240 --> 39:28.368
ROSALEE: He just
loaded it into his car.

39:29.200 --> 39:30.565
What do you want us to do?

39:30.680 --> 39:33.251
Nothing. Just sit tight.

39:36.960 --> 39:38.200
(CELL PHONE BEEPS)

39:44.640 --> 39:45.971
(ENGINE STARTING)

40:12.160 --> 40:13.491
You're a thief.

40:13.680 --> 40:15.205
Among other things.

40:16.640 --> 40:18.051
You lied to me.

40:18.320 --> 40:20.322
You did what we
needed you to do.

40:21.080 --> 40:23.765
You mean give you enough
time to get the Anubis out.

40:23.840 --> 40:26.844
You got your murderer.
Even trade.

40:27.120 --> 40:30.488
You should have just told me what
you wanted in the first place.

40:30.840 --> 40:32.763
You might not have agreed.

40:34.000 --> 40:35.365
I still haven't.

40:36.360 --> 40:38.169
I don't expect you to understand

40:38.240 --> 40:40.527
why this is so important to us,

40:41.080 --> 40:43.242
but I can't let you
stop me this time.

40:45.880 --> 40:47.325
We're not going to.

40:49.320 --> 40:50.765
This time.

40:58.680 --> 40:59.681
(GROWLS)

41:19.720 --> 41:22.326
This is really kind of touching.

41:23.880 --> 41:26.167
Except for the part
where we helped them steal

41:26.240 --> 41:28.447
a 3,000-year-old
mummy and burn it.

41:30.400 --> 41:32.243
It's not like we
do it every day.

41:36.880 --> 41:38.609
Hey. You ready
to go home?

41:38.880 --> 41:40.041
Oh, yeah.

41:40.120 --> 41:42.361
Let's get out of here
before they change my mind.

41:44.760 --> 41:47.491
Did I hear that you guys
lost an Egyptian mummy?

41:48.440 --> 41:49.680
How'd you hear that?

41:50.360 --> 41:52.442
Weird news travels fast in here.

41:53.800 --> 41:55.006
So how you feeling?

41:55.080 --> 41:56.286
Good. Good.

41:56.400 --> 41:58.368
They help you figure out
what you think you saw?

41:58.440 --> 41:59.680
Yeah, pretty much.

41:59.760 --> 42:02.047
So you don't think what
you saw was real anymore?

42:02.200 --> 42:03.770
Real? No.
It was never real.

42:03.800 --> 42:05.609
That's one thing I'm sure of.
(BUZZER BUZZES)

42:06.600 --> 42:07.931
Well, that's good.

42:08.000 --> 42:10.765
Yeah, guess so. It was
all just in my head.

42:11.120 --> 42:13.282
And that is where
it's gonna stay.
