WEBVTT

00:06.257 --> 00:08.049
I love making clothes,

00:08.049 --> 00:09.760
but I thought a class
called Life Skills

00:09.760 --> 00:11.552
would be about
recycling, voting

00:11.552 --> 00:13.474
and how to DVR
three shows at once.

00:13.474 --> 00:14.635
You know,
stuff you can use.

00:16.397 --> 00:17.688
It's not at all
what I expected, either.

00:17.688 --> 00:19.690
I thought
it was Knife Skills.

00:19.690 --> 00:21.312
Now I'm gonna have to pick
up whittling on the street.

00:22.643 --> 00:24.355
I'm taking this class
pass-fail.

00:24.355 --> 00:26.237
I'm doing the least amount
of work possible.

00:26.237 --> 00:28.949
It will be my greatest apathetic
achievement since--

00:28.949 --> 00:31.532
Eh, who cares.

00:31.532 --> 00:35.366
Well, I am pretty excited
about my homework assignment.

00:36.867 --> 00:38.749
Avery, that looks
like a real skirt.

00:38.749 --> 00:40.501
Thanks. That's almost
like a real compliment.

00:42.463 --> 00:44.375
Hey, that's not
Ms. Hennessey.

00:44.375 --> 00:45.426
Must be a sub today.

00:46.507 --> 00:49.380
Namaste, students.

00:49.380 --> 00:51.382
I am your new teacher,
Ms. Dupont,

00:51.382 --> 00:53.934
but please call me Lavanya,

00:53.934 --> 00:56.637
the name given to me
by a Sherpa.

00:56.637 --> 00:59.100
It's Sanskrit
for "grace and beauty."

00:59.100 --> 01:00.981
Or possibly Tibetan
for "slow hiker."

01:02.273 --> 01:05.776
Or English for--
Eh, who cares.

01:05.776 --> 01:09.029
Ms. Hennessey quit
to follow her dream

01:09.029 --> 01:11.612
of nailing her tongue
to a coffee table.

01:11.612 --> 01:13.494
Or maybe that was her
sarcastic way of telling me

01:13.494 --> 01:14.495
it's none of my business.

01:14.495 --> 01:16.407
Hmm.

01:16.407 --> 01:19.790
Class, I want you all
to take out your syllabuses...

01:21.202 --> 01:22.583
and rip them in half.

01:25.336 --> 01:27.298
But, Ms. Dupont,
the syllabus represents order.

01:27.298 --> 01:28.419
I can't.

01:28.419 --> 01:30.050
Please call me Lavanya.

01:30.050 --> 01:31.172
I can't do that either.

01:31.172 --> 01:32.423
Avery, calm down.

01:32.423 --> 01:33.424
I can't do that either!

01:38.349 --> 01:40.811
You just imagined yourself
exploding, didn't you?

02:00.161 --> 02:02.413
I followed the pattern,
just like you followed yours.

02:02.413 --> 02:05.336
So why does mine
look like this?

02:08.249 --> 02:11.051
Did you do yours in a car?

02:11.051 --> 02:13.133
On a curvy road?

02:13.133 --> 02:14.515
With someone trying
to wrestle you?

02:16.927 --> 02:18.599
Guess I better get
my project ready.

02:18.599 --> 02:19.720
What is it?

02:19.720 --> 02:21.682
It's a poncho. See?

02:21.682 --> 02:23.143
You forgot to cut the hole.

02:23.143 --> 02:24.225
Pass-fail, yo.

02:26.317 --> 02:28.229
Avery.

02:28.229 --> 02:30.321
I worked very hard on this,
Ms. Dupont.

02:30.321 --> 02:32.403
Ooh! The grading
bell gives it a "C".

02:33.824 --> 02:35.276
A "C"?
That's right, a "C".

02:35.276 --> 02:37.908
Oops, I just rang a "B".

02:37.908 --> 02:40.281
Sorry, I didn't mean
to tease you with that.

02:41.782 --> 02:43.284
Why am I getting a "C"?

02:43.284 --> 02:44.915
I followed
the pattern exactly.

02:44.915 --> 02:46.837
But I grade on
self-expression.

02:46.837 --> 02:49.129
This shows nothing
of who you are.

02:49.129 --> 02:51.001
It shows exactly who I am.

02:51.001 --> 02:53.424
I'm the type of person
who follows patterns exactly.

02:54.595 --> 02:56.297
You need to expand.

02:56.297 --> 02:59.680
Think of it as a "C"
for "expand your horizons."

03:01.262 --> 03:03.063
There's no "C"
in any of those words.

03:06.397 --> 03:10.571
Lindsay, I've never gotten
a "C" before in my entire life.

03:10.571 --> 03:12.613
What is going on here?

03:12.613 --> 03:15.406
It's like I've entered some
bizarre alternate universe.

03:15.406 --> 03:17.117
Am I gonna open that door

03:17.117 --> 03:18.369
and see monkeys
in business suits?

03:18.369 --> 03:20.120
Gosh, I hope so.

03:21.412 --> 03:22.533
Calm down, Avery.

03:22.533 --> 03:24.285
Everything is perfectly normal.

03:24.285 --> 03:28.289
Lindsay, this is true
creative expression. "A."

03:28.289 --> 03:30.331
I love
this alternate universe.

03:31.752 --> 03:34.885
Max. Very unconventional.
Pass.

03:34.885 --> 03:36.507
I'm so lucky I passed.

03:36.507 --> 03:38.299
I put it on backward.

03:41.101 --> 03:43.264
STAN: Avery is having a rough
time with her new teacher,

03:43.264 --> 03:46.106
but I'm about to have
the greatest day ever.

03:46.106 --> 03:49.350
Tyler is taking me
on a toe tasting trip.

03:49.350 --> 03:51.402
Aw, yeah, dawg.

03:51.402 --> 03:53.153
The vet?

03:53.153 --> 03:56.277
Aw, nah, dawg.

03:56.277 --> 03:57.908
This isn't toe tasting.

03:57.908 --> 03:59.360
Why do you always trick me?

03:59.360 --> 04:01.362
Why do you always fall for it?

04:01.362 --> 04:03.203
You really thought
that toe tasting exists?

04:03.203 --> 04:05.205
Deep down,
I knew it probably didn't.

04:05.205 --> 04:07.458
But I wanted it, Tyler.

04:07.458 --> 04:09.249
I wanted it so bad.

04:11.672 --> 04:13.043
All right.

04:14.465 --> 04:15.966
It's okay, Stan.

04:15.966 --> 04:17.177
It's just a check-up.

04:17.177 --> 04:18.879
And if you're a good boy,

04:18.879 --> 04:21.091
we'll stop for some toe tasting
on the way home.

04:21.091 --> 04:22.433
Toe tasting?

04:22.433 --> 04:23.764
There's a place
on the way home?

04:23.764 --> 04:25.436
How convenient.

04:27.267 --> 04:28.649
Mommy's taking a long time
to park the car.

04:28.649 --> 04:30.351
She's probably scared
to come in.

04:30.351 --> 04:32.062
She hasn't been back
since she worked here

04:32.062 --> 04:33.564
and was attacked
by all those animals.

04:33.564 --> 04:35.396
That must be
why they made that poster,

04:35.396 --> 04:38.068
"Be nice to animals
or this will happen."

04:40.280 --> 04:41.952
Oh, I just put that up.

04:41.952 --> 04:43.454
I was going to hang it
at the toe tasting,

04:43.454 --> 04:45.205
but it works better here.

04:47.207 --> 04:49.249
I just think it's brave of Mom
to come back.

04:49.249 --> 04:50.831
I mean, she's going to be
freaking out

04:50.831 --> 04:52.333
when she gets in here.

04:52.333 --> 04:54.875
Ah, what a lovely day
at the vet's office.

04:54.875 --> 04:57.177
I can't think of any place
I'd rather be.

04:57.177 --> 05:00.220
What did you do with my mommy,
you calm, ordinary woman?

05:02.222 --> 05:04.885
I just had your father teach me
some relaxation techniques.

05:04.885 --> 05:06.557
I'm floating in the ocean

05:06.557 --> 05:09.229
as the waves gently
massage my shoulders.

05:09.229 --> 05:10.561
Plash-plash.

05:10.561 --> 05:12.523
A breeze caresses my cheeks.

05:13.894 --> 05:16.567
Oh, a passing ocean liner.

05:16.567 --> 05:18.989
( imitating ship horn )

05:20.781 --> 05:22.863
This is why I'm not
a people doctor.

05:24.535 --> 05:27.327
Hello, Dr. Young.
I'm relaxed.

05:27.327 --> 05:29.540
Oh, oh, but the sun
is burning my skin.

05:29.540 --> 05:31.211
Better put on some sunscreen.

05:35.716 --> 05:38.088
Again, not a people doctor.

05:39.219 --> 05:40.340
Sorry to keep you waiting.

05:40.340 --> 05:41.962
I was dealing with a dog

05:41.962 --> 05:43.964
who may have
an abdominal blockage.

05:43.964 --> 05:46.346
If poor little Buster doesn't
start eating in a few days,

05:46.346 --> 05:48.348
we're going to have
to do exploratory surgery.

05:48.348 --> 05:51.522
What I like to call
"peeking in the Pekingese."

05:53.564 --> 05:55.436
I'm kidding,
he's not a Pekingese,

05:55.436 --> 05:57.277
but you can't peek
in a terrier,

05:57.277 --> 05:59.980
unless you have
an "ulterrier" motive.

06:03.404 --> 06:06.407
Oh, it's the whimsical
chatter of the dolphins.

06:07.488 --> 06:09.410
You raise a good point, Mom.

06:09.410 --> 06:11.331
There are lots of
other animals in the ocean.

06:11.331 --> 06:14.294
There's sharks
and jellyfish that sting

06:14.294 --> 06:17.628
and giant squid
that can crush a boat.

06:17.628 --> 06:19.630
And who knows
what else is down there?

06:19.630 --> 06:21.341
Cameras can only go so far.

06:21.341 --> 06:25.426
Okay, why don't I put
your mom in the car?

06:25.426 --> 06:27.007
I'll be right back to finish
Stan's check-up.

06:27.007 --> 06:29.219
( Ellen whimpers )

06:29.219 --> 06:30.811
I wonder if seeing Mommy like
that is going to have an effect

06:30.811 --> 06:33.353
on how I handle stress
when I grow up.

06:33.353 --> 06:34.394
Eh, I'm eight.

06:34.394 --> 06:35.395
Can't worry about it now.

06:37.397 --> 06:38.228
This isn't good.

06:38.228 --> 06:40.230
Don't worry, Stan.

06:40.230 --> 06:41.822
The prince I marry
will make everything okay,

06:41.822 --> 06:43.403
or they wouldn't
put it in movies.

06:44.364 --> 06:45.866
No, it's not that--

06:45.866 --> 06:47.237
And good plan,
by the way.

06:48.699 --> 06:49.950
I'm worried
about that dog Buster.

06:49.950 --> 06:51.331
Why?

06:51.331 --> 06:53.373
He doesn't have
an abdominal blockage.

06:53.373 --> 06:55.035
I noticed on the way in,

06:55.035 --> 06:56.957
his butt smells
like rancid garbage,

06:56.957 --> 06:58.749
so the butt's doing its job.

07:00.501 --> 07:02.382
But his mouth smelled rotten,

07:02.382 --> 07:04.094
which means
he has a rotten tooth.

07:04.094 --> 07:05.506
That's why he's not eating.

07:05.506 --> 07:07.638
Why doesn't Dr. Young
know that?

07:07.638 --> 07:10.350
Buster probably has plaque
that's hiding the rotten tooth.

07:10.350 --> 07:12.262
That happened to me,

07:12.262 --> 07:15.105
which is why I now brush twice
daily with Tyler's toothbrush.

07:16.266 --> 07:17.818
Stan, that's gross.

07:17.818 --> 07:19.149
Hey, it was your idea
to get a dog.

07:21.231 --> 07:22.442
( sighs )

07:22.442 --> 07:24.444
Dr. Young, what happened?

07:24.444 --> 07:26.406
Let's just say the story
has three participants:

07:26.406 --> 07:29.369
your mother, a squirrel,
and a traffic cone.

07:29.369 --> 07:31.572
One of the first two is hiding
under the traffic cone.

07:31.572 --> 07:33.243
You don't want to know which.

07:33.243 --> 07:35.285
Let's see what's going on
with Stan.

07:35.285 --> 07:37.578
First, shouldn't you check
on Buster again?

07:37.578 --> 07:39.249
Maybe he has a rotten tooth.

07:39.249 --> 07:40.711
Well, you would know
better than me.

07:40.711 --> 07:42.292
I've only been a vet
for 20 years.

07:42.292 --> 07:44.424
That's nothing compared
to the hours you spent

07:44.424 --> 07:47.217
gluing a toy horse's head
onto your doll's body.

07:47.217 --> 07:49.139
Hey, this is good work.

07:51.802 --> 07:54.054
All right, class,
let's see your projects.

07:54.054 --> 07:55.225
Knock my socks off.

07:55.225 --> 07:56.807
Metaphorically.

07:56.807 --> 07:58.519
I don't wear socks
to better experience

07:58.519 --> 08:00.230
the world through my feet.

08:01.692 --> 08:03.443
Ooh, Lindsay.

08:03.443 --> 08:06.817
Your work makes
quite a statement.

08:06.817 --> 08:08.819
We must learn to hug ourselves

08:08.819 --> 08:10.821
before we can expect
others to hug us.

08:10.821 --> 08:13.704
Right, because I sure didn't
accidentally sew myself

08:13.704 --> 08:15.285
into this
while watching TV.

08:17.708 --> 08:22.422
Oh, and what statement does
your project make, Avery?

08:22.422 --> 08:25.465
It says,
"Hi, I'm Avery's jacket.

08:25.465 --> 08:27.387
I hope you like things
that are awesome."

08:30.551 --> 08:34.264
I selected an advanced pattern
and followed it perfectly.

08:34.264 --> 08:36.226
Then
I'm giving you a "C".

08:36.226 --> 08:37.517
Ding-a-ling.

08:37.517 --> 08:38.899
I can't find
my bell anywhere.

08:40.811 --> 08:42.352
A "C"?

08:42.352 --> 08:43.984
I stayed up all night
feeding fabric

08:43.984 --> 08:45.736
through my sewing machine.

08:45.736 --> 08:47.608
My hands are frozen like this.

08:47.608 --> 08:49.319
Well, actually,
they were frozen like this.

08:49.319 --> 08:51.111
But they've gotten
this much better.

08:52.362 --> 08:54.364
Please, Mrs. Dupont.

08:54.364 --> 08:57.788
I have asked you repeatedly
to call me Lavanya, Avery.

08:57.788 --> 08:59.790
Two things I learned
from my Sherpa

08:59.790 --> 09:01.792
are "Be open
with your thinking,"

09:01.792 --> 09:03.293
and "Walk faster,
it's getting dark.

09:03.293 --> 09:04.544
Do you want
to die up here?"

09:06.426 --> 09:09.800
Take a look at what the students
around you are doing.

09:09.800 --> 09:13.473
They are expressing themselves
with open hearts, like Lindsay.

09:16.887 --> 09:18.098
And Max.

09:19.439 --> 09:20.891
It's a scarf. It's a belt.

09:20.891 --> 09:23.233
It's a ninja headband. Hi-ya!

09:23.233 --> 09:24.234
Brilliant.

09:25.816 --> 09:28.108
I'm so sorry,
I keep making you look bad.

09:34.574 --> 09:36.406
Dad, how do you think
this looks on me?

09:38.198 --> 09:39.870
I've played this game
with your mother

09:39.870 --> 09:42.082
and I believe
my next move is,

09:42.082 --> 09:44.374
"How do you think
it looks on you?"

09:45.876 --> 09:47.007
I think it looks amazing.

09:47.007 --> 09:48.378
Then so do I.

09:49.549 --> 09:50.761
Exactly.

09:50.761 --> 09:52.673
But my horrible teacher,

09:52.673 --> 09:54.885
Ms. Dupont, gave me a "C"

09:54.885 --> 09:57.057
on both this skirt
and this jacket.

09:57.057 --> 09:58.478
A "C"?

09:58.478 --> 09:59.890
But you've never
gotten a "C" before.

09:59.890 --> 10:01.221
That's what I said.

10:01.221 --> 10:03.684
But Ms. Dupont
has it in for me.

10:03.684 --> 10:05.605
She is an evil woman.

10:05.605 --> 10:07.898
And evil doesn't always
arrive in a cloud of fire.

10:07.898 --> 10:09.900
Sometimes it drives
a '71 V.W. Bug

10:09.900 --> 10:11.902
with 27 bumper stickers.

10:11.902 --> 10:13.403
Dukakis lost.

10:13.403 --> 10:14.905
Get over it already.

10:16.446 --> 10:18.238
Well, I only have
one bumper sticker

10:18.238 --> 10:20.240
and it says
"My daughter gets all 'A's".

10:20.240 --> 10:23.083
Am I gonna have to change it?
Those do not scrape off.

10:23.083 --> 10:25.876
What are colleges going to say
when they notice

10:25.876 --> 10:28.208
I got a "C" in Life Skills?

10:28.208 --> 10:32.342
It literally means
I'm mediocre at life.

10:32.342 --> 10:34.424
Do not worry, Avery.

10:34.424 --> 10:36.807
I will go down to the school
and I'll talk to her for you.

10:36.807 --> 10:38.348
Great.

10:38.348 --> 10:39.810
I would really
appreciate that, Dad.

10:43.223 --> 10:44.765
And when do you think
you might go?

10:44.765 --> 10:46.186
Tomorrow.

10:46.186 --> 10:48.108
It's been a pretty tiring day

10:48.108 --> 10:49.359
and I've got a lot of paperwork
to get caught up on.

10:49.359 --> 10:51.571
Yeah, me too.

10:51.571 --> 10:54.444
I've to write an essay
on my hero for English.

10:54.444 --> 10:56.656
I have it narrowed
down to you and Mom.

10:56.656 --> 10:58.118
I'll go now.

11:03.834 --> 11:06.957
Guys, I just can't stop
thinking about Buster.

11:06.957 --> 11:07.958
That dog at the vet?

11:07.958 --> 11:09.880
Yeah.

11:09.880 --> 11:11.712
In a few days, he's going
to have unnecessary surgery

11:11.712 --> 11:14.464
when all he needs
is a rotten tooth pulled.

11:14.464 --> 11:16.386
It's like how Tyler
cleaned out the whole garage

11:16.386 --> 11:17.557
looking for his bike
and then remembered

11:17.557 --> 11:18.719
he left it at school.

11:18.719 --> 11:20.260
It worked out okay.

11:20.260 --> 11:21.431
The pogo stick I found
in the garage

11:21.431 --> 11:23.263
was a pretty sweet ride.

11:23.263 --> 11:25.645
And I met a really cute girl
who was stuck in a tree.

11:27.397 --> 11:29.439
Guys, what are
we gonna do about Buster?

11:29.439 --> 11:31.651
If only we could get
into the vet's office,

11:31.651 --> 11:33.483
we could clean
Buster's tooth

11:33.483 --> 11:35.575
and Dr. Young would be able
to see what's wrong.

11:35.575 --> 11:37.077
Well, you could pretend
you're sick

11:37.077 --> 11:38.368
so Mom will take us back there.

11:38.368 --> 11:40.370
"Pretend" is for amateurs.

11:40.370 --> 11:43.203
I inhabit a character.
What's my backstory?

11:43.203 --> 11:44.324
You're a dog
and you're sick.

11:44.324 --> 11:46.126
Excellent.

11:46.126 --> 11:49.329
Give me 7 weeks to shadow
a sick dog and I got this.

11:49.329 --> 11:51.211
Stan, we don't have
that kind of time.

11:51.211 --> 11:53.964
Okay, then just an intensive
session with my acting coach.

11:53.964 --> 11:56.096
Robert, clear your schedule.

11:58.548 --> 12:00.971
I don't care if you have
a lunch appointment.

12:00.971 --> 12:03.844
Mila Kunis is not doing
your movie.

12:10.400 --> 12:12.442
Mom, Stan's really sick.

12:12.442 --> 12:14.064
He needs to go back
to the vet.

12:14.064 --> 12:15.735
The vet?
No, I don't think so.

12:15.735 --> 12:17.317
He looks fine to me.

12:17.317 --> 12:19.069
This is serious, Mom.

12:19.069 --> 12:20.951
He has a sore throat,
a fever.

12:20.951 --> 12:22.282
He can't go to school today.

12:22.282 --> 12:23.243
What?

12:23.243 --> 12:24.825
Sorry, force of habit.

12:26.206 --> 12:28.038
Come on, Stan.
Eat your soup.

12:28.038 --> 12:32.332
Eat your soup.
Eat your soup!

12:34.044 --> 12:35.295
Okay, dial it
down there, Chloe.

12:35.295 --> 12:37.007
You're spitting all over me.

12:38.428 --> 12:40.340
Aren't you kids
overreacting?

12:40.340 --> 12:41.842
He doesn't seem that sick.

12:41.842 --> 12:43.553
( Stan grunting )

12:47.057 --> 12:48.058
He sounds fine to me.

12:48.058 --> 12:49.229
Mom.

12:51.351 --> 12:53.984
All right, I will schedule
a vet appointment for tomorrow.

12:53.984 --> 12:55.856
I can see
how worried you are,

12:55.856 --> 12:58.238
that you care more about
Stan's well-being than mine.

13:00.400 --> 13:02.162
"No, Mom.
We love you."

13:02.162 --> 13:03.283
Too late!

13:05.665 --> 13:07.457
You did it, Stan.

13:07.457 --> 13:09.749
You should win an award
for that performance.

13:09.749 --> 13:12.292
I expected to win
this award.

13:12.292 --> 13:15.335
Oh, this is so unexpected.

13:15.335 --> 13:17.417
I'd like to thank
my entire cast.

13:17.417 --> 13:19.469
I'm gonna learn your names,
I promise.

13:21.261 --> 13:22.682
The producers for taking
a chance on me.

13:22.682 --> 13:24.344
Oh, I'm being told
to wrap it up.

13:24.344 --> 13:26.636
And thanks, of course,
to Robert.

13:26.636 --> 13:28.889
We did it, buddy!

13:30.730 --> 13:32.272
Are you texting?

13:32.272 --> 13:34.814
I'm winning
an award up here.

13:39.860 --> 13:41.361
Oh. Hey, Dad.

13:41.361 --> 13:42.242
How did things go
with Ms. Dupont?

13:42.242 --> 13:44.284
Lavanya?

13:44.284 --> 13:47.287
Oh, she is such a sweet
and enlightened woman.

13:47.287 --> 13:49.159
After talking to her
for just an hour,

13:49.159 --> 13:51.451
I'm thinking about
giving up meat.

13:51.451 --> 13:54.254
But she gave me "C"s on both

13:54.254 --> 13:56.296
of my perfect
homework assignments.

13:57.918 --> 14:00.010
I can't believe
you're taking her side.

14:00.010 --> 14:03.263
Look, Avery, why don't you
just take a deep breath,

14:03.263 --> 14:07.467
shake it out
and find your inner animal?

14:07.467 --> 14:10.180
Mine is a red-tailed hawk.

14:10.180 --> 14:11.892
Ca-caw.

14:13.353 --> 14:15.235
That was so much
less embarrassing

14:15.235 --> 14:17.237
when I did it
with Lavanya.

14:17.237 --> 14:18.738
She's a panda.

14:22.402 --> 14:25.155
Well, even though
I'm gonna get another "C",

14:25.155 --> 14:26.826
I stayed true
to my principles

14:26.826 --> 14:29.249
and made another
flawless project.

14:29.249 --> 14:31.331
Don't do that
to yourself, Avery.

14:31.331 --> 14:33.123
Here, you could use
these pants I made.

14:33.123 --> 14:35.295
She'll love them.
I sewed the legs together.

14:35.295 --> 14:36.376
Ooh! Ooh!

14:38.208 --> 14:39.549
You're a good friend, Lindsay.

14:44.214 --> 14:45.926
It was tough to get
to class wearing these.

14:45.926 --> 14:48.098
Luckily, someone left
a pogo stick in the commons.

14:48.098 --> 14:50.350
And I met a really cute guy
who was stuck in a tree.

14:51.811 --> 14:53.313
Lavanya
gave me a passing grade

14:53.313 --> 14:55.775
for my "Emperor's New Clothes"
project.

14:55.775 --> 14:58.188
I also got extra credit
for the matching vest.

15:00.230 --> 15:01.571
Well done, Theo.

15:03.403 --> 15:05.325
What does the gong mean?

15:05.325 --> 15:07.657
It means I still
can't find my bell.

15:09.449 --> 15:11.411
And what do you have
for me today, Avery?

15:11.411 --> 15:13.243
Another perfect project.

15:13.243 --> 15:15.335
Go ahead and give me a "C".

15:15.335 --> 15:17.297
No, Avery,
because I'm disappointed

15:17.297 --> 15:19.339
you've learned nothing
from the first two assignments,

15:19.339 --> 15:21.091
I'm giving you a "D".

15:22.963 --> 15:24.344
A "D"?

15:24.344 --> 15:26.306
You're giving me a "D"?

15:26.306 --> 15:27.968
I'll show you a "D".

15:31.261 --> 15:33.393
There, now it looks
like a "D".

15:33.393 --> 15:35.815
No, now it looks like an "F".

15:35.815 --> 15:38.318
( class gasps )

15:38.318 --> 15:39.439
What just happened?

15:55.125 --> 15:57.247
Avery, you have got
to thank Lavanya for me.

15:57.247 --> 15:59.419
I love this
new veggie lifestyle.

15:59.419 --> 16:02.292
I just made a smoothie out of
Mom's avocado face cream.

16:02.292 --> 16:03.963
I'm pretty sure
that's not edible.

16:03.963 --> 16:06.386
I'm pretty sure
you're right.

16:06.386 --> 16:09.389
Oh.

16:09.389 --> 16:12.092
Um, are you giving
yourself an "F"?

16:12.092 --> 16:14.094
Just thinking about
what Ms. Dupont would give me

16:14.094 --> 16:15.645
if she were grading
my painting.

16:15.645 --> 16:17.307
So it didn't go well
in class today?

16:17.307 --> 16:20.400
My top was perfect
and she gave me an "F".

16:20.400 --> 16:22.402
She doesn't
appreciate perfection

16:22.402 --> 16:24.274
and now
I'm stress-eating cashews.

16:28.908 --> 16:32.872
Your inner animal is very
chipmunk-y today, Avery.

16:32.872 --> 16:34.664
You should trust the panda.

16:34.664 --> 16:36.246
Quoth the red-tailed hawk.

16:36.246 --> 16:37.917
Ca-caw.

16:37.917 --> 16:41.081
How long have
you been off meat?

16:41.081 --> 16:43.173
For a whole day
and I'm a little lightheaded.

16:44.834 --> 16:47.387
But I actually think
if Lavanya saw your painting,

16:47.387 --> 16:48.888
she'd give you an "A".

16:48.888 --> 16:50.340
I think it is exactly
the kind of free

16:50.340 --> 16:52.132
and creative expression

16:52.132 --> 16:53.723
she's pushing
for in your classwork.

16:53.723 --> 16:55.435
But painting is
what I do for myself.

16:55.435 --> 16:57.307
It's not for school.

16:57.307 --> 16:59.269
And maybe
that's Lavanya's whole point.

16:59.269 --> 17:00.900
She wants you
to break down the wall

17:00.900 --> 17:03.523
between schoolwork
and creativity.

17:05.235 --> 17:06.236
Whoa.

17:06.236 --> 17:08.027
Gong.

17:09.359 --> 17:10.780
That was me hitting a gong

17:10.780 --> 17:12.452
because veggie Dad is
profound.

17:14.154 --> 17:16.076
So when are you gonna
start eating meat again?

17:16.076 --> 17:17.997
Yeah, I'm still
a little weak

17:17.997 --> 17:20.160
from yesterday's
dandelion cleanse.

17:20.160 --> 17:22.422
It was very difficult
to hold up an invisible gong.

17:22.422 --> 17:25.255
These guns need
ammo, Avery.

17:25.255 --> 17:26.426
Don't do the ca-caw.

17:28.218 --> 17:29.339
Ca-caw!

17:33.052 --> 17:34.934
So what's the problem
with Stan?

17:34.934 --> 17:36.436
Well, he's been
whimpering,

17:36.436 --> 17:39.389
lethargic
and making this noise...

17:39.389 --> 17:40.810
( gagging )

17:42.732 --> 17:44.524
Oh, even Robert
couldn't fix that performance.

17:46.276 --> 17:47.777
Wow, Ellen, I'm impressed

17:47.777 --> 17:49.239
that you're so calm
this time around.

17:49.239 --> 17:50.780
It's because of this
calming juice

17:50.780 --> 17:52.242
I got at the health food store.

17:52.242 --> 17:53.953
It's made from herbs
and vitamins

17:53.953 --> 17:56.246
which create
an all-natural relaxing state.

17:56.246 --> 17:58.198
It's really working wonders.

17:58.198 --> 18:00.330
Th-This is carrot juice.

18:00.330 --> 18:02.081
What?

18:02.081 --> 18:03.333
There's no such thing
as calming juice.

18:03.333 --> 18:05.505
What?

18:05.505 --> 18:08.298
Now all I can think of
is animals attacking me,

18:08.298 --> 18:10.260
probably because
I'm staring at a poster

18:10.260 --> 18:11.301
of animals attacking me.

18:11.301 --> 18:13.092
Who would make that?

18:13.092 --> 18:14.304
I don't know.
It just appeared one day.

18:14.304 --> 18:16.055
But it seems
to calm the animals.

18:17.597 --> 18:19.639
Yeah, look how calm
these guys are.

18:19.639 --> 18:21.060
( Ellen whimpers )

18:22.392 --> 18:24.063
Looks like
it's car time for Mom.

18:27.277 --> 18:28.278
Now's our chance.

18:30.280 --> 18:31.691
There's Buster.

18:31.691 --> 18:32.862
We better clean
his tooth fast.

18:32.862 --> 18:34.284
We don't have much time.

18:34.284 --> 18:35.695
I'm going in.

18:39.949 --> 18:41.080
Floss.

18:46.626 --> 18:47.917
Toothpaste.

18:50.089 --> 18:51.421
Toothbrush.

18:53.383 --> 18:55.305
Hey, that looks just like
my new toothbrush.

18:55.305 --> 18:56.886
Coincidence, huh?

19:05.395 --> 19:07.397
All right,
there's the rotten tooth.

19:07.397 --> 19:09.399
I've cleared away the plaque
and exposed it.

19:09.399 --> 19:11.441
Pretty much done
everything except

19:11.441 --> 19:13.733
put a sign on him
that says "rotten tooth".

19:13.733 --> 19:15.825
Tyler, if you would.

19:20.410 --> 19:22.582
Hey, what are you
kids doing?

19:22.582 --> 19:24.624
And why is your dog
wearing a surgical mask?

19:24.624 --> 19:27.337
And why is that dog wearing
a sign that says "rotten tooth"?

19:28.418 --> 19:31.211
All good questions.

19:31.211 --> 19:33.383
But we really think you should
take a look at Buster's tooth,

19:33.383 --> 19:35.094
as per the sign.

19:36.886 --> 19:38.508
You kids just won't
give up on this, will you?

19:38.508 --> 19:40.430
Please, Dr. Young.

19:40.430 --> 19:42.181
For me?

19:42.181 --> 19:45.395
Don't make me blink
and make a pouty face.

19:45.395 --> 19:49.399
I will melt your heart.

19:53.313 --> 19:54.404
Okay, I'll check it out.

19:58.578 --> 20:00.530
Huh.
You kids were right.

20:00.530 --> 20:02.282
Buster does have
a rotten tooth.

20:02.282 --> 20:03.913
And I was about
to operate on him

20:03.913 --> 20:05.705
and charge
thousands of dollars

20:05.705 --> 20:07.377
only to find nothing there
and buy a new watch

20:07.377 --> 20:09.128
to replace the one
I lost in the last dog.

20:11.251 --> 20:12.592
I'm kidding.
I'm kidding.

20:12.592 --> 20:14.424
I operated again
to retrieve it.

20:14.424 --> 20:16.506
I'd never leave anything
that expensive in a dog.

20:22.342 --> 20:24.394
Ms. Dupont,
I'm really sorry

20:24.394 --> 20:26.105
about how I behaved
in class yesterday.

20:26.105 --> 20:28.398
I shouldn't have reacted
so immaturely

20:28.398 --> 20:30.400
over getting a bad grade.

20:30.400 --> 20:32.231
I also shouldn't
have taken your bell.

20:34.404 --> 20:36.526
And I re-did my homework.

20:41.991 --> 20:44.284
I made this dress
and painted this on it

20:44.284 --> 20:46.996
because my painting is
an expression of who I am.

20:48.538 --> 20:50.790
And I don't even care
what grade I get.

20:50.790 --> 20:53.583
Oh, Avery,
I love your dress.

20:53.583 --> 20:56.135
But I'm still not giving you
an "A" for it.

20:56.135 --> 20:57.337
What?

20:58.968 --> 21:01.431
Your incredible project
has inspired me

21:01.431 --> 21:03.553
to create a whole
new grading system.

21:03.553 --> 21:05.765
I'm giving you a Cloud.

21:05.765 --> 21:06.976
Is a Cloud the highest?

21:06.976 --> 21:08.308
Yes.

21:09.479 --> 21:11.230
Sorry, sorry. Yours.

21:12.852 --> 21:14.484
Thank you so much,
Ms. Dupont.

21:14.484 --> 21:16.235
Lavanya.
Let's not go crazy here.

21:16.235 --> 21:17.276
Okay.

21:18.608 --> 21:20.490
Well, wow, Avery.
A Cloud.

21:20.490 --> 21:24.203
That's gonna look
pretty sweet to Harvard.

21:24.203 --> 21:26.075
You know, when they
shorten it on your report card,

21:26.075 --> 21:28.328
it's just gonna be a "C".

21:31.501 --> 21:34.123
STAN: This week I really
went outside my comfort zone.

21:34.123 --> 21:36.796
And I proved
I'm a qualified veterinarian

21:36.796 --> 21:38.838
and a talented actor.

21:38.838 --> 21:41.220
In fact, Robert and I
decided to keep

21:41.220 --> 21:43.182
our collaboration going

21:43.182 --> 21:45.805
and he's now directing me
in a one-man show.

21:45.805 --> 21:48.267
My name is Benjamin Franklin.

21:50.189 --> 21:52.482
Get ready to go
on a 5-hour journey

21:52.482 --> 21:54.434
through my entire life.

21:54.434 --> 21:56.396
Five hours?

21:56.396 --> 21:58.237
Don't worry,
dogs have no concept of time.

21:58.237 --> 21:59.238
The end.

21:59.238 --> 22:00.400
See.
