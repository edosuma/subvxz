Victor: ME TOO.

08:02.783 --> 08:04.583
AND THANKS
FOR MAKING IT HAPPEN, MIKE.

08:06.153 --> 08:07.786
YEAH, YOU'RE WELCOME.

08:07.788 --> 08:09.421
LET'S GO
KILL SOME STUFF.

08:09.423 --> 08:12.090
PLEASE TELL ME YOU'VE GOT
A SMALL GUN IN THERE.

08:12.092 --> 08:13.758
OH, NO.
IT'S MY MANDOLIN.

08:13.760 --> 08:16.328
I MEMORIZED
EVERY VERSE OF "AMERICAN PIE."

08:16.330 --> 08:17.629
WELL, YOU PLAY THAT,

08:17.631 --> 08:19.764
THIS WILL BE
THE DAY THAT YOU DIE.

08:28.709 --> 08:31.943
OH, MAN.

08:31.945 --> 08:33.445
IT'S GREAT
TO BE BACK.

08:33.447 --> 08:36.448
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME
SINCE THAT CRAZY WEEKEND

08:36.450 --> 08:39.584
WENDI AND I CLEANED OUT
THE ADULT PLEASURE STORE.

08:41.221 --> 08:44.623
JUST...GIVE ME A MINUTE.

08:44.625 --> 08:47.526
JUST CLEAN UP.
DON'T PLAY WITH ANYTHING.

08:49.496 --> 08:50.962
THIS IS BREATHTAKING!

08:50.964 --> 08:52.697
OH. HEY, DAD.
LET ME GRAB THAT FOR YOU.

08:52.699 --> 08:53.832
OH!
SAVE YOUR STRENGTH.

08:53.834 --> 08:57.068
YEAH. RIGHT.
I'M DYING.

08:57.070 --> 08:59.504
OH, BUT I DON'T WANT
TO BE A BURDEN HERE.
I'LL MAKE MY OWN DRINKS.

08:59.506 --> 09:01.973
SOMEBODY BROUGHT SOUR MIX,
RIGHT?

09:01.975 --> 09:03.575
YOU'RE NOT GONNA HAVE
ANY DRINKS.

09:03.577 --> 09:05.644
YOU'RE GONNA TAKE YOUR SON FOR
A WALK AND TELL HIM THE TRUTH.

09:05.646 --> 09:07.679
MIKE, A DRINK
WOULD REALLY HELP ME.

09:07.681 --> 09:10.649
A<i> SHRINK</i> WOULD REALLY HELP YOU,
BUT WE DIDN'T PACK ONE OF THOSE.

09:14.154 --> 09:16.521
ALL RIGHT.
WELCOME, CAMPERS.

09:16.523 --> 09:18.056
UH, TWO HOUSE RULES --

09:18.058 --> 09:20.692
ONE, THE BIG COFFEE MUG
IS MINE,

09:20.694 --> 09:22.561
AND NOBODY DIES HERE,
ALL RIGHT?

09:24.064 --> 09:26.464
I WANT TO BE ABLE
TO SELL THIS PLACE TO ASIANS.

09:28.335 --> 09:30.569
YOU KNOW,
HE'S NOT KIDDING ABOUT THAT.

09:30.571 --> 09:33.738
THEY PAY CASH, BUT THEY'RE
SQUIRRELLY ABOUT DEATH.

09:33.740 --> 09:36.675
OKAY, LET'S STAY POSITIVE.
NOBODY'S GOING TO DIE HERE.

09:36.677 --> 09:38.443
I KNOW THAT MESSAGE
IS MEANT THAT FOR YOUR DAD,

09:38.445 --> 09:40.345
BUT IT'S HELPFUL
FOR ED, TOO.

09:41.682 --> 09:43.615
UH, DAD.
YEAH?

09:43.617 --> 09:45.216
I-I WAS GONNA WAIT
TILL TONIGHT,

09:45.218 --> 09:46.851
BUT, UH, I WANT
TO READ YOU SOMETHING.

09:46.853 --> 09:48.219
IT'S A POEM
THAT I WROTE.

09:48.221 --> 09:50.088
WHAT'S THE FASTEST-ACTING BOOZE
YOU GOT?

09:51.925 --> 09:54.593
SOME OF THIS
WILL BE HARD TO HEAR.

09:54.595 --> 09:55.594
HE'S NOT KIDDING.

09:55.596 --> 09:57.028
HE'S GOT FOUR STANZAS

09:57.030 --> 09:59.130
ABOUT TRYING TO PLAY CATCH
WITH A TOMBSTONE.

09:59.132 --> 10:00.799
I'LL JUST DRINK IT
OUT OF THE BOTTLE.

10:00.801 --> 10:02.467
YEAH.

10:02.469 --> 10:05.637
UM, IT GETS A LITTLE DARK,
BUT IT ENDS IN A GOOD PLACE,

10:05.639 --> 10:07.172
JUST LIKE
I HOPE YOU AND I WILL.

10:08.141 --> 10:10.075
I CALL IT "POPPA."

10:10.077 --> 10:12.143
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.
THIS HAS GOT TO STOP.

10:12.145 --> 10:13.578
WE'RE ON THE VERGE
OF A BREAKTHROUGH.

10:13.580 --> 10:16.381
YOU'RE ON THE VERGE
OF A SEVERE BEATING.

10:16.383 --> 10:18.116
YOU WANT TO KNOW
THE BAD NEWS?

10:18.118 --> 10:19.451
YOUR DAD'S NOT SICK.

10:19.453 --> 10:21.186
THERE'S NOTHING WRONG
WITH HIM.

10:22.556 --> 10:24.222
WHAT?

10:24.224 --> 10:26.291
HE'S NOT DYING?

10:26.293 --> 10:29.127
WHY DID HE
GET TO RIDE SHOTGUN?

10:31.098 --> 10:33.331
IT'S TRUE.

10:33.333 --> 10:35.433
I LET YOU BELIEVE
THAT I WAS STILL SICK

10:35.435 --> 10:37.402
BECAUSE I THOUGHT
IT WAS THE ONLY WAY

10:37.404 --> 10:39.070
TO GET YOU
TO SEE ME AGAIN.

10:40.407 --> 10:43.241
NOW,
HOW ABOUT THAT POEM?

10:43.243 --> 10:45.310
UNBELIEVABLE.

10:45.312 --> 10:47.412
YOU KNOW, YOU HAVE ALWAYS BEEN
A SELF-CENTERED LIAR,

10:47.414 --> 10:49.848
BUT THIS TIME,
YOU'VE<i> REALLY</i> OUTDONE YOURSELF.

10:49.850 --> 10:51.449
I KNOW YOU DIDN'T MEAN THAT
AS A COMPLIMENT,

10:51.451 --> 10:52.817
BUT I'M GONNA TAKE IT
AS ONE,

10:52.819 --> 10:54.919
JUST TO KEEP THINGS LOVING
BETWEEN US.

10:54.921 --> 10:56.488
AND YOU WILL NEVER CHANGE.

11:03.764 --> 11:05.263
ALL RIGHT,
THAT'S<i> YOUR</i> FAULT.

11:05.265 --> 11:06.831
THERE'S A VACUUM CLEANER
IN THE CLOSET, ALL RIGHT?

11:08.368 --> 11:12.337
WAIT. JUST...LET ME QUICKLY
CHECK THE ATTACHMENTS FIRST.

11:13.674 --> 11:16.307
DON'T TRY TO GET ME TO GO BACK
IN THERE AND TALK TO HIM.

11:16.309 --> 11:19.177
NO, I JUST CAME OUT TO THANK YOU
FOR RIPPING UP THAT POETRY.

11:21.281 --> 11:22.947
LISTEN, THERE'S
A LITTLE MOTEL IN TOWN.

11:22.949 --> 11:24.349
I COULD TAKE YOU
DOWN THERE.

11:24.351 --> 11:26.117
NO REASON TO SPEND
ANY MORE TIME WITH YOUR DAD.

11:26.119 --> 11:27.552
OF COURSE
YOU WOULD DO THAT FOR ME.

11:27.554 --> 11:29.454
YOU'VE BEEN MORE A FATHER
THAN<i> HE'S</i> EVER BEEN.

11:29.456 --> 11:33.458
YOU KNOW, THAT'S SAD, ACTUALLY,
SINCE ALL I DO IS PICK ON YOU.

11:33.460 --> 11:36.027
GRAB YOUR STUFF.

11:37.731 --> 11:40.799
AM I REALLY SUPPOSED TO BELIEVE
THAT HE LIED TO ME ABOUT DYING

11:40.801 --> 11:42.300
SO HE COULD
GET CLOSER TO ME?

11:42.302 --> 11:44.969
HE SAYS IT WORKS FOR HIM
IN BARS.

11:44.971 --> 11:47.472
WHEN I THOUGHT I WAS LOSING HIM,
I WAS SO SAD,

11:47.474 --> 11:51.509
AND NOW I HAVE HIM BACK,
AND I'M JUST...MAD.

11:51.511 --> 11:53.511
REALLY CAN'T STOP THE POETRY,
CAN YOU?

11:53.513 --> 11:57.415
SEE, HE NEVER WORKED THIS HARD
TO SPEND TIME WITH ME BEFORE.

11:57.417 --> 12:00.218
WELL, I...GUESS
THAT COUNTS FOR<i> SOMETHING?</i>

12:00.220 --> 12:02.220
I JUST WISH HE WAS DIFFERENT,
YOU KNOW?

12:02.222 --> 12:04.189
WE CAN'T PICK OUR FATHERS,
YOU KNOW.

12:04.191 --> 12:06.858

TO MICKEY MANTLE.

12:09.429 --> 12:11.496

12:12.733 --> 12:14.099
ALL RIGHT,
WHAT DO I DO?

12:14.101 --> 12:16.334
DO I GO BACK IN THERE
AND GIVE HIM ANOTHER SHOT?

12:16.336 --> 12:18.169
IT'S YOUR CALL, RYAN.
