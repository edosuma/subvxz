00:05.492 --> 00:06.531
Elena: Zachary Cain.

00:06.555 --> 00:07.679
Clay: Something's not right.

00:07.703 --> 00:09.758
Cain's not smart enough
to come up with a plan.

00:09.790 --> 00:10.923
Karl Marsten.

00:10.925 --> 00:13.266
- Since when did Mutts work together?
- Never.

00:13.298 --> 00:15.172
Marsten and Cain are building an army.

00:15.193 --> 00:16.860
Everything they're doing

00:16.894 --> 00:18.750
is because of you, Clay.

00:19.670 --> 00:21.104
What do you want, Mr. Boggs?

00:21.106 --> 00:23.206
I want what you got.
Word is, Pack's weak.

00:23.208 --> 00:25.775

00:27.646 --> 00:29.879
Jeremy and the others haven't
been entirely honest with you.

- Clay is out of control.

00:39.490 --> 00:40.823

Ahhh!

00:40.825 --> 00:42.358
there will be serious consequences.

00:42.360 --> 00:44.827
- Clay, what's wrong?
- I've done things.

00:44.829 --> 00:47.030
Necessary things.

00:47.032 --> 00:49.298

00:55.339 --> 00:57.273
There's only one body.
They took his eyes.

01:44.219 --> 01:45.319
Go ahead.

01:48.858 --> 01:50.091

01:50.093 --> 01:52.093
Why did you kill Dennis Stillwell?

01:52.095 --> 01:54.028
Santos: <i>Technically it wasn't me.</i>

01:54.030 --> 01:55.863
But you've got to admit,

01:55.865 --> 01:57.364
it's an attention grabber.

01:57.366 --> 02:00.134
- You have my attention.
<i>- Good.</i>

02:00.136 --> 02:03.303
Because I want to be heard,

02:03.305 --> 02:05.038
Well, it'll be hard for you to talk

02:05.040 --> 02:06.706

02:06.708 --> 02:08.609
(Laugh)
You see,

02:08.610 --> 02:11.545
now, that is what we need
to be talking about.

02:11.547 --> 02:14.781
<i>The violent ways with which</i>
<i>you uphold the Pack laws.</i>

02:14.783 --> 02:17.250
Now you know how it feels
to be on the receiving end.

02:17.252 --> 02:19.485
<i>All that my associates and I want</i>

02:19.487 --> 02:21.788
<i>is to get out from underneath</i>
<i>the Pack's oppressive rule.</i>

02:21.790 --> 02:24.624
The rules of our society have
been established for centuries.

02:24.626 --> 02:27.127
What makes you think we'd be
interested in changing them now?

02:27.129 --> 02:29.328
Well, I'm sure you're not, Antonio,

02:29.330 --> 02:31.063
since you're the ones in power.

02:31.065 --> 02:32.498
<i>But there are a number of us who think</i>

02:32.500 --> 02:34.900
<i>it's about time for a new world order.</i>

02:34.902 --> 02:36.335
<i>If you don't agree, that's fine.</i>

02:36.337 --> 02:38.371
But you can count on
having some more funerals.

02:38.373 --> 02:40.806
What have you done with Joey Stillwell?

02:40.808 --> 02:42.408
<i>He's safe for now.</i>

02:42.410 --> 02:44.043
<i>Still has all his body parts,</i>

02:44.045 --> 02:46.245
<i>which is more than I can</i>
<i>say for Samuel Boggs.</i>

02:46.247 --> 02:48.047
Boggs thought we were weak.

02:48.049 --> 02:49.648
He needed to be taught a lesson.

02:49.650 --> 02:52.785
Dennis Stillwell thought we
were second class citizens.

02:52.787 --> 02:54.653
He was taught a lesson as well.

02:54.655 --> 02:57.289

02:57.291 --> 02:58.490

<i>You and I get together, hash things out.</i>

03:00.460 --> 03:02.460
Great. Come to Stonehaven, we'll talk.

03:02.462 --> 03:05.063
You still haven't gotten the
blood stains out of your carpet

<i>I was thinking we could</i>
<i>meet at the park,</i>

<i>on the east side of Bear Valley.</i>

03:11.371 --> 03:13.305
That doesn't work for me.

03:21.581 --> 03:22.847
Fine.

There's an abandoned campground

03:24.084 --> 03:25.516

08:06.931 --> 08:09.232
if the doctor prescribed
a little bed rest for me,

08:32.589 --> 08:34.389
I wasn't prepared for it.

I never meant to keep it a secret, okay?

08:46.102 --> 08:49.504
just disappeared out of my life.

- Yeah,

I've got an email address
associated with the username.

11:24.822 --> 11:26.689
I'll have the rest of
the info in a few minutes.

11:42.440 --> 11:45.240
Does she live with you?

11:45.242 --> 11:48.043
It's a simple yes or no. The
questions get harder in round two.

11:48.045 --> 11:49.678
She's just moved in.

11:49.680 --> 11:51.447

- Excuse me?
- The guy who posted the video.

12:02.358 --> 12:04.693
And, based on his
labyrinthian security system,

12:04.695 --> 12:06.461
he's a real wirehead.

12:06.463 --> 12:09.397
Normally, I'd have been through
those firewalls in half the time.

a bit of a nut job.

to government officials.

12:18.308 --> 12:20.341

12:20.343 --> 12:21.709
His last known address

is an apartment in Corktown.

12:25.414 --> 12:26.947

buy the rights to the video

He sees you and all he'll see is a suit,

12:44.466 --> 12:46.133

inside town limits.

coming up here to confront him.

33:30.278 --> 33:33.045

when he made those statements.

33:33.047 --> 33:35.314
He had had a few drinks.

33:35.316 --> 33:37.182
From my limited experience,

33:37.184 --> 33:39.051
when a man's had a few too many drinks,

33:39.053 --> 33:40.920
he tends to be a bit boastful.

33:40.922 --> 33:42.755
And then when he sobers up,

33:42.757 --> 33:45.357
he gets a little more rational.

33:45.359 --> 33:48.127
Now, the last time any
of us saw Mr. Braxton

33:48.129 --> 33:50.862

that poor dead child.

Let's get him out of here.

36:25.091 --> 36:26.691
Thanks for your time.

36:26.693 --> 36:28.894
I'll have Clay call
as soon as he returns.

36:28.896 --> 36:31.863
I don't mind driving back
out here to talk to him.

36:31.865 --> 36:34.332
I'd like to see the rest of the house.

36:34.334 --> 36:36.167
Maybe some other time,

36:36.169 --> 36:38.670
when you're not in the middle
of a murder investigation.

36:38.672 --> 36:41.072
- Yes. - Yeah.
- Thanks again.

36:45.043 --> 36:47.278
(Panting)

36:50.749 --> 36:52.783
She's gone.

36:54.086 --> 36:55.887
(Groaning)

36:57.189 --> 36:59.623
- Stay here, I'll grab the med kit.
- Okay.

37:11.369 --> 37:13.169
(Cellphone ringing)

37:15.640 --> 37:17.240
It's Jeremy Danvers.

37:18.476 --> 37:20.176
I'll call him back.

37:20.178 --> 37:22.345
Babe, it's Jeremy.

37:22.347 --> 37:23.914
You better take this.

37:27.484 --> 37:29.552
- Hello?
Jeremy: <i>- Logan...</i>

37:29.554 --> 37:32.322
things have escalated.

37:32.324 --> 37:34.124
Antonio is dead.

37:36.493 --> 37:37.794
Everything okay?

37:39.463 --> 37:42.732
<i>Logan, are you there?</i>

37:42.734 --> 37:45.067
- What happened?
<i>- The Mutts attacked us.</i>

37:45.069 --> 37:47.937
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, I will be.

37:47.939 --> 37:49.806
I need you to come back.

37:51.508 --> 37:53.809
I'm so sorry, just...

37:53.811 --> 37:55.945
I'll come as soon as I can.

37:55.947 --> 37:58.314
Clay is bringing Cain in
for questioning.

37:58.316 --> 37:59.949
The rest of the Mutts
are still out there

37:59.951 --> 38:02.717
<i>and they're on a murderous spree.</i>

38:02.719 --> 38:04.753
I want the family back here as a Pack.

38:04.755 --> 38:08.290
Logan: <i>Just... I have some things I
need to take care of here first.</i>

38:09.859 --> 38:13.562
Tell Nick I'm...

38:13.564 --> 38:15.096
<i>My thoughts are with him.</i>

38:21.170 --> 38:23.438
What's wrong?

38:23.440 --> 38:25.774
Just more family issues.

38:25.776 --> 38:27.942
How long are you going
to be gone this time?

38:29.578 --> 38:31.446
I'm not going anywhere.

38:45.594 --> 38:47.294
Wow.

38:47.296 --> 38:48.929
Always wondered what
this place looked like.

38:48.931 --> 38:51.431
Wait until you see the
guest suite downstairs.

38:57.839 --> 38:59.873
Jeremy: Elena.

39:05.380 --> 39:06.480
You were successful.

39:08.316 --> 39:10.150
We got lucky.

39:10.152 --> 39:13.786
I think that we deserved a
little bit of luck today,

39:13.788 --> 39:15.155
don't you?

39:18.492 --> 39:20.459
Jeremy...

39:22.930 --> 39:26.499
I may have lost a little bit
more blood than I thought.

39:28.836 --> 39:31.771
I will be good as new in the morning.

39:31.773 --> 39:34.006
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

39:35.475 --> 39:37.809
(Cellphone chiming)

39:40.414 --> 39:43.049
Philip?

39:43.051 --> 39:45.384
Now's not the time.

39:45.386 --> 39:47.386
Call him back.

39:47.388 --> 39:49.087
Call him back.

39:49.089 --> 39:52.190
You need to assure him
that you're all right.

39:52.192 --> 39:54.826
Otherwise he may be on the next
train out here to Bear Valley.

39:54.828 --> 39:57.529
No, I'm more worried
about you right now.

39:57.531 --> 39:59.798
Don't be.

39:59.800 --> 40:01.199
Call him.

40:09.375 --> 40:11.242
(Soft gasp)

40:18.517 --> 40:20.151
(Grunt)

40:29.861 --> 40:32.529
What now, tough guy?

40:32.531 --> 40:34.999
Now you tell me the
location of the warehouse.

40:36.668 --> 40:38.902
Doesn't ring a bell.

40:38.904 --> 40:41.938
The place you and Marsten
and your psycho buddy

40:41.940 --> 40:44.841
were talking about the
other day at the motel.

40:44.843 --> 40:47.411
Oh, yeah. The motel.

40:47.413 --> 40:49.413
Marsten thought he smelled
you and the bitch.

40:51.116 --> 40:54.151
You like the little gift
we left behind for you?

40:54.153 --> 40:56.219
(Grunting)

40:57.521 --> 40:59.122
I guarantee

40:59.124 --> 41:01.024
you will tell me where to find them

41:01.026 --> 41:02.492
before I'm done with you.

41:08.599 --> 41:10.934
(Remote phone ringing)

41:10.936 --> 41:13.536
Philip: (On phone) <i>Hi.</i>

41:13.538 --> 41:15.404
Hey, it's me.

41:15.406 --> 41:18.073
Where are you?

41:18.075 --> 41:19.475
Are you all right?

41:21.311 --> 41:22.645
I'm okay.

41:25.315 --> 41:27.316
Look, I'm...

41:27.318 --> 41:29.384
I'm sorry for leaving you like that.

41:29.386 --> 41:32.054
<i>It was a horrible thing</i>
<i>for me to do to you.</i>

41:32.056 --> 41:33.622
Yeah, I'd have to agree.

41:35.525 --> 41:39.061
I just... I haven't had
to deal with a death...

41:39.063 --> 41:41.930
in my family since my parents.

41:44.333 --> 41:46.968
And being with your
family at the wedding,

41:46.970 --> 41:49.504
it all just sort of...

41:49.506 --> 41:51.239
hit me hard.

41:51.241 --> 41:53.375
<i>I just needed to take some time</i>

41:53.377 --> 41:55.644
<i>to work through a few things.</i>

41:57.480 --> 41:59.181
It's all right.

41:59.183 --> 42:01.549
<i>Maybe one day you'll let me help you</i>

42:01.551 --> 42:03.785
<i>work through those things.</i>

42:03.787 --> 42:05.720
That would be nice.

42:05.722 --> 42:08.056
<i>Are you back at Bear Valley?</i>

42:09.491 --> 42:10.858
For now.

42:10.860 --> 42:14.195
Is Logan there,
or someone you can talk to?

42:15.430 --> 42:17.331
Elena: Some of the cousins are here.

42:17.333 --> 42:21.134
We're... we're dealing with it together.

42:26.308 --> 42:29.076
I hope you stay with me through this.

42:31.513 --> 42:33.146
You know I will.

42:33.148 --> 42:35.215
<i>I'll see you soon.</i>

42:37.418 --> 42:38.685
Yeah.

42:44.325 --> 42:46.159
(Impact thud)

42:47.494 --> 42:48.595
Jeremy?

42:51.998 --> 42:54.367
Jeremy!

42:54.369 --> 42:55.702
Hey...

42:55.704 --> 42:57.669
Jeremy...

42:57.671 --> 42:58.870
Nick!
