Here you go, guys.
A little hot coffee.

01:07.859 --> 01:09.443
Where'd we even go last night?

01:09.444 --> 01:11.028
I have no idea.

01:11.029 --> 01:12.946
- Cup of coffee, Joe?
- Yeah. Thanks.

01:12.947 --> 01:14.281
(Joe screams)

01:14.282 --> 01:16.575
I remember we got
really excited about something.

01:16.576 --> 01:17.910
That's right, that's right,
we had that

01:17.911 --> 01:19.119
million-dollar business idea.

01:19.120 --> 01:21.455
- Does anyone remember it?
- More coffee, Joe?

01:21.456 --> 01:23.248
Sure, I'll take another cup.

01:23.249 --> 01:25.626
- (Joe screams)
- Didn't anyone write it down?

01:25.627 --> 01:27.545
Wait a minute,
maybe it's in my pocket.

01:29.506 --> 01:31.882
Peter, are you just rubbing
pocket cloth over your wang?

01:31.883 --> 01:35.385
I'm actually popping a leg
pimple, mister smarty pants.

01:35.386 --> 01:37.888
Damn it, I'm sick of us always
forgetting our great ideas

01:37.889 --> 01:39.014
when we're drinking.

01:39.015 --> 01:41.016
Well, down at work,
we wear body cams.

01:41.017 --> 01:42.726
We could just do that
when we're drinking.

01:42.727 --> 01:44.728
That's a great idea, Joe.

01:44.729 --> 01:47.314
Thanks. Now maybe you'll
take down those three billboards

01:47.315 --> 01:48.983
you put up about me.

02:07.085 --> 02:08.710
Wow, Joe, these are pretty cool.

02:08.711 --> 02:11.338
Yeah, they're not as heavy
as I thought they'd be.

02:11.339 --> 02:14.007
And we can live stream
the footage on my iPad.

02:14.008 --> 02:15.425
(loudly)
How do we talk when they're on?

02:15.426 --> 02:16.593
Like, different?

02:16.594 --> 02:19.304
No, Peter.
Use your normal speaking voice.

02:19.305 --> 02:21.181
- All right, let's hit it.
- Hang on, guys.

02:21.182 --> 02:24.268
I'm just gonna
say goodbye to Lois.

02:24.269 --> 02:25.894

<i>to the Clam with the guys.</i>

02:29.774 --> 02:31.650
<i>Oh, surprise, surprise.</i>

02:31.651 --> 02:33.235
<i>Another night out</i>
<i>with the losers.</i>

02:33.236 --> 02:36.405
<i>PETER: Losers?! Name five</i>
<i>things wrong with each of them.</i>

02:36.406 --> 02:37.866
<i>With pleasure.</i>

02:39.659 --> 02:42.202
Lois sends her love.
Come on, let's go.

02:42.203 --> 02:44.663
What does she mean,
"Can't eat an ear of corn"?

02:44.664 --> 02:47.583
I can't help it
if my adult teeth never came in.

02:47.584 --> 02:49.668
She says I call Steinfeld
<i>Steinfeld?</i>

02:49.669 --> 02:52.170
Of course I do, that's his name.
Jerry Steinfeld.

02:52.171 --> 02:55.424
<i>Pardon</i> me,
to quote his famous bit.

02:55.425 --> 02:57.593
She says I say <i> erverybody</i> weird?

02:57.594 --> 03:00.888
I say <i> erverybody</i> just like
erverybody else does.

03:00.889 --> 03:02.764
You do say that weird.

04:12.543 --> 04:14.211
All right, here we go.

04:14.212 --> 04:16.213
Million-dollar business ideas.

04:16.214 --> 04:19.216
Open forum, no self-editing.
Wide-open slate.

04:19.216 --> 04:20.801
No such thing as a bad idea.

04:20.802 --> 04:22.511
- Beer in a bag.
- Bad idea.

04:22.512 --> 04:24.638
Oh, oh, I got one.
Big Tic Tac,

04:24.639 --> 04:26.932
so you don't have to eat
so many little Tic Tacs.

04:26.933 --> 04:28.266
Nice, Glenn,
you're on the board.

04:28.267 --> 04:30.268
All right, any ideas.
No bad ideas.

04:30.269 --> 04:31.812
- Soup in a sleeve.
- Bad idea.

04:31.813 --> 04:33.647
All right, Peter,
you're so great,

04:33.648 --> 04:35.273
why don't you give us an idea?

04:35.274 --> 04:37.567
Okay, you know how they
put ice in urinals?

04:37.568 --> 04:39.945
Well, what happens to that ice
at the end of the day?

04:39.946 --> 04:42.406
It's wasted.
We collect urinal ice

04:42.407 --> 04:43.949
and sell it to local bars.

04:43.950 --> 04:45.117
Peter, that'll never work.

04:45.118 --> 04:47.327
Oh, no?

04:47.328 --> 04:51.124
Is that the <i> tinkling</i>
of ice I hear?

04:54.961 --> 04:57.462
All right, let's check out
what we did last night.

04:57.463 --> 04:59.589
QUAGMIRE:
God, that's so shaky.

04:59.590 --> 05:00.799
CLEVELAND:
It's hard to watch.

05:00.800 --> 05:02.509
PETER:
What is that one?

05:02.510 --> 05:06.096
JOE:
That's mine. I'm basically
a human Steadicam.

05:06.097 --> 05:08.724
- It's beautiful.
- So smooth.

05:08.725 --> 05:10.350
Lot of guy butts.

05:10.351 --> 05:12.644
Yeah, my sight line's
a little lower than most.

05:12.645 --> 05:13.895
Look at a girl butt once.

05:13.896 --> 05:15.814
What the hell were we
doing here?

05:15.815 --> 05:18.734
PETER: Oh, this must have been
when we were jumping around

05:18.735 --> 05:21.111
to "Jump Around,"
like the song asked us to.

05:21.112 --> 05:22.904
JOE: Oh, yeah, I was
so into this song.

05:22.905 --> 05:25.365
Look at my footage.
I was going bananas.

05:25.366 --> 05:27.285
PETER: All right, let's
fast-forward a little here.

05:30.455 --> 05:33.331
Just looks like we're drinking
at a random bar.

05:33.332 --> 05:36.209
We ain't talking about
any million-dollar ideas.

05:36.210 --> 05:38.378
Wait, wait, pause it.
Zoom in on that napkin.

05:38.379 --> 05:39.213
What does that say?

05:41.591 --> 05:43.800
There it is.
"Warm cuts."

05:43.801 --> 05:45.427
Like cold cuts, but warm.

05:45.428 --> 05:47.220
Our million-dollar idea.

05:47.221 --> 05:48.805
Warm cuts? That's dumb.

05:48.806 --> 05:52.434
If it's so dumb, how come
we're pitching it on <i> Shark Tank?</i>

05:52.435 --> 05:53.977
<i>PETER (on TV):</i>
<i>Now, when we first</i>
<i>started Warm Cuts,</i>

05:53.978 --> 05:55.645
<i>it was just a gross idea.</i>

05:55.646 --> 05:58.190
<i>But this year,</i>
<i>we're on track to get sued</i>

05:58.191 --> 06:00.525
<i>for $12.5 million.</i>

06:00.526 --> 06:02.360
<i>That's quadruple</i>
<i>the projections.</i>

06:02.361 --> 06:04.404
<i>You know what,</i>
<i>I like your product.</i>

06:04.405 --> 06:06.948
<i>But more than that,</i>
<i>I like you guys.</i>

06:06.949 --> 06:10.494
<i>I'm in, and I'll give you</i>
<i>exactly what you're asking for:</i>

06:10.495 --> 06:13.789
<i>$100,000 for ten percent.</i>

06:13.790 --> 06:15.874
<i>What do you say?</i>

06:15.875 --> 06:18.502
<i>PETER:</i>
<i>Does anyone other than Robert</i>
<i>have an offer?</i>

06:18.503 --> 06:21.046
Wait, why are only three
of us on <i> Shark Tank?</i>

06:21.047 --> 06:22.464
Yeah, where's Quagmire?

06:22.465 --> 06:24.008
Oh, my God, is that--

06:26.928 --> 06:28.386
Quagmire, you hooked up.

06:28.387 --> 06:29.846
All right.

06:29.847 --> 06:32.182
Oh, no, wait, wait.
It's on film.

06:32.183 --> 06:34.726
That's not all right.
What if my boss sees this?

06:34.727 --> 06:36.228
What if my dad sees it?

06:36.229 --> 06:38.897
It's fine, Glenn.
You can't even see your face.

06:38.898 --> 06:42.234
<i>You did it again,</i>
<i>Glenn Quagmire.</i>

06:42.235 --> 06:45.237
Oh, my God. Joe,
you have to delete this footage.

06:45.238 --> 06:47.447
Sorry, Glenn, the footage is
automatically uploaded

06:47.448 --> 06:49.282
to the Internet every night.

06:49.283 --> 06:51.410
The Internet?!
Oh, my God.

06:54.330 --> 06:57.499
Excuse me, ma'am,
no porn at the bar.

06:57.500 --> 06:59.042
Oh, it's okay, I'm transgender.

06:59.043 --> 07:00.919
Oh, I-I had no idea.

07:00.920 --> 07:03.380
Do whatever you want
all the time.

07:03.381 --> 07:06.091
Oh, Glenn...

07:06.092 --> 07:07.592
BRIAN:
Howdy, stranger.

07:07.593 --> 07:09.719
Brian?
What are you doing here?

07:09.720 --> 07:11.847
- I'm an alcoholic.
- Oh, right.

07:11.848 --> 07:13.598
So, you saw the video, huh?

07:13.599 --> 07:16.101
Oh, yeah.
It's just so hard.

07:16.102 --> 07:17.894
Well, it has to be for sex.

07:17.895 --> 07:19.187
No, no, I mean-I mean
it's difficult

07:19.188 --> 07:21.898
to watch your son embarrass
himself so publicly.

07:21.899 --> 07:24.943
Yeah, that parent-child
relationship is so special.

07:24.944 --> 07:26.820
Sometimes you want
to shake 'em by the shoulders

07:26.821 --> 07:28.780
and say,
"Aah, what are you doing?"

07:28.781 --> 07:31.158
But you just got to give 'em
the biggest hug you can

07:31.159 --> 07:33.660
and let 'em know that you'll
always be there for them.

07:33.661 --> 07:35.203
- How's your son, Brian?
- We don't talk.

07:35.204 --> 07:37.080
But, Ida, you can't
blame yourself.

07:37.081 --> 07:39.708
As much as you want to save
your kids from their mistakes,

07:39.709 --> 07:42.377
it's their mistakes that
help them grow and change

07:42.378 --> 07:43.879
and become their best selves.

07:43.880 --> 07:45.964
You know, Brian,
that's what I like about you.

07:45.965 --> 07:48.216
You're so wise and kind.

07:48.217 --> 07:50.135
I think that's what
originally drew me to you.

07:50.136 --> 07:53.054
Yep, here I am, Mr. Wisdom,

07:53.055 --> 07:55.056
sitting at the bottom
of a bottle,

07:55.057 --> 07:56.433
just like every Tuesday.

07:56.434 --> 07:58.768
- Brian, it's Thursday.
- Oh, boy.

07:58.769 --> 08:00.937
Why do you always
run yourself down?

08:00.938 --> 08:02.731
You're handsome,
you're loyal.

08:02.732 --> 08:04.900
You give your paw
after a couple of tries.

08:04.901 --> 08:06.902
Come on, paw.

08:06.903 --> 08:10.113
Paw. Paw...

08:10.114 --> 08:12.365
There you go. Good boy.

08:12.366 --> 08:15.660
I just wish you could see
yourself the way I see you.

08:15.661 --> 08:17.245
Ehh, mirrors kind of
freak me out.

08:17.246 --> 08:19.998
(laughs)
And-and funny, too.

08:19.999 --> 08:22.083
Except for a job
and your own home,

08:22.084 --> 08:24.253
you are the full package,
Brian Griffin.

08:25.671 --> 08:28.882
Ida... should we get a room?

08:28.883 --> 08:30.468
Absolutely.

08:33.054 --> 08:36.097
(scoffs) They've got
one person working back there.

08:37.600 --> 08:39.392
Morning, sleepyhead.

08:39.393 --> 08:41.227
- Morning.
- Some night, huh?

08:41.229 --> 08:42.729
Yeah, it really was.

08:42.730 --> 08:45.190
They dropped a <i> USA Today</i>
outside our room.

08:45.191 --> 08:46.900
- You want to read it?
- Oh, God, no.

08:46.901 --> 08:49.319
Well, I guess we'll pretend
this never happened,

08:49.320 --> 08:51.071
and I'll see you
in another two years.

08:51.072 --> 08:52.614
(laughs)
Yeah.

08:52.615 --> 08:54.950
You know what? No.

08:54.951 --> 08:56.660
What are you doing Friday night?

08:56.661 --> 08:57.911
Well, that depends.

08:57.912 --> 08:59.829
Is <i> Friday Night Videos</i>
still a thing?

08:59.830 --> 09:01.706
No, it hasn't been
for quite some time.

09:01.707 --> 09:03.124
Well, then, I'm free.

09:03.125 --> 09:05.001
Does that mean you're
asking me out?

09:05.002 --> 09:06.211
I guess it does.

09:06.212 --> 09:08.922
You're... not ashamed
to be with me?

09:08.923 --> 09:10.590
No, I'm not.
I don't care anymore.

09:10.591 --> 09:13.593
I guess I'm just not as hung up
as I used to be.

09:13.594 --> 09:15.345
- (knock on door)
- MAN: Room service.

09:15.346 --> 09:16.805
Oh, my God,
you ordered room service?!

09:16.806 --> 09:17.931
Are you crazy?

09:17.932 --> 09:19.224
What if somebody finds out
I'm in here

09:19.225 --> 09:21.351
having goofball sex?

09:21.352 --> 09:23.395
- (knock on door)
- MAN: Hello? Room service.

09:23.396 --> 09:24.938
I've got your eggs
and Snausages.

09:24.939 --> 09:25.940
Snausages.

09:34.282 --> 09:36.741
Table 13. The fish is
for the gentleman,

09:36.742 --> 09:38.201
and the chicken is for the lady.

09:38.202 --> 09:39.453
Got it.

09:40.788 --> 09:42.789
Great. Is that our food?

09:42.790 --> 09:44.833
<i>WAITER:</i>
<i>The fish is for the gentleman,</i>

09:44.834 --> 09:47.585
<i>and the chicken</i>
<i>is for the lady.</i>

09:47.586 --> 09:50.213
I'll be right back, folks.

09:50.214 --> 09:51.923
Well, thanks for picking me
to break in

09:51.924 --> 09:53.383
your new Discover card with.

09:53.384 --> 09:55.093
Hey, thanks for co-signing
for it.

09:55.094 --> 09:56.596
My pleasure.

09:58.514 --> 10:00.974
(yawning)

10:00.975 --> 10:03.143
Brian,
I can't help but notice

10:03.144 --> 10:06.146
you're a little uncomfortable
spending time with me.

10:06.564 --> 10:08.481
I thought you said
you weren't ashamed of me.

10:08.482 --> 10:09.649
What are you talking about?

10:09.650 --> 10:11.359
Because I made you lie down
in the backseat

10:11.360 --> 10:13.319
all the way here?
You looked tired.

10:13.320 --> 10:15.071
It just seems like
you're always taking me

10:15.072 --> 10:17.657
to out-of-the-way places
to avoid being seen together.

10:17.658 --> 10:20.410
- Like yesterday.
- Come on, that's not true.

10:20.411 --> 10:22.496
I just wanted to show you
a beautiful view.

10:24.248 --> 10:28.042
Wow, check out that
big blue marble.

10:28.043 --> 10:29.544
Look, there's another shuttle.

10:29.545 --> 10:30.755
- Get away from the window!
- (groans)

10:36.635 --> 10:38.636
Okay, maybe, maybe this <i> has</i> been

10:38.637 --> 10:40.847
a little weirder for me
than I thought.

10:40.848 --> 10:42.724
I'm sorry, Ida. I...

10:42.725 --> 10:45.935
I really care about you
and you deserve better.

10:45.936 --> 10:48.480
- Can I help you?
- The fish is for...

10:48.481 --> 10:51.775
The fish is for me.
And the chicken...

10:51.776 --> 10:54.904
the chicken is for
my girlfriend, Ida Davis.

10:57.239 --> 10:59.866
"Girlfriend"?
Are you sure, Brian?

10:59.867 --> 11:01.534
I'm sure.

11:01.535 --> 11:04.245
And from now on,
I'm not hiding anything.

11:04.246 --> 11:07.041
Like Peter
and his formaldehyde jars.

11:08.959 --> 11:11.169
- Peter?
- Yes?

11:11.170 --> 11:13.922
Is this is about my work?

11:13.923 --> 11:16.841
Hi, I have a Styrofoam cooler
with weird tape on it?

11:16.842 --> 11:20.595
Ah, that must be the cat brains
and baby bodies.

11:20.596 --> 11:23.264
Are you making people?

11:23.265 --> 11:25.600
(laughs): He'll be flattered
you called him that.

11:25.601 --> 11:27.603
(cackles)

11:32.608 --> 11:34.943
(clears throat)
Hello, everybody.

11:34.944 --> 11:37.028
I have some pretty big news.

11:37.029 --> 11:40.532
- It may come
as a surprise, but...
- It's about Ida, isn't it?

11:40.533 --> 11:43.159
It has to be. Why else
would Ida be in our house?

11:43.160 --> 11:45.328
Meg's right.
I-Ida's only been here, what,

11:45.329 --> 11:47.705
- like, twice her whole life?
- You think they did it again?

11:47.706 --> 11:50.834
- Well, what else could it be?
- They do have a lot in common.

11:50.835 --> 11:52.919
Two mature people
with dwindling options.

11:52.920 --> 11:54.963
Like, I know Brian was
squeamish about sleeping

11:54.964 --> 11:57.966
with a trans woman before,
but it's 2019 now.

11:57.967 --> 12:01.177
Yeah, things that were gross
five years ago are now heroic.

12:01.178 --> 12:04.514
Wow. Brian and Ida.
Good for them.

12:04.515 --> 12:06.057
Well, that's a relief.

12:06.058 --> 12:08.893
Now the only other person we
have to tell about us is Glenn.

12:08.894 --> 12:11.312
Oh, God, I haven't
even thought about that.

12:11.313 --> 12:13.731
Mr. Quagmire hates Brian.

12:13.732 --> 12:15.441
Yes, my big brother's right.

12:15.442 --> 12:17.193
Quagmire thinks Brian's trash.

12:17.194 --> 12:19.153
Well, just have him
over here for dinner.

12:19.154 --> 12:21.573
We'll help you.
We're here for you, Brian.

12:21.574 --> 12:24.200
You know what? You're right.
I can do this.

12:24.201 --> 12:27.036
After all, I'm not the first
person to deliver tough news.

12:27.037 --> 12:28.955
Like when they found Waldo.

12:28.956 --> 12:31.833
There are many things
I can't go into at this time,

12:31.834 --> 12:33.918
but I can confirm
that a body was removed

12:33.919 --> 12:36.087
from Waldo's apartment
this morning.

12:36.088 --> 12:37.964
REPORTER:
Is this being treated
as a suicide?

12:37.965 --> 12:40.008
Again, I can't confirm.

12:40.009 --> 12:43.511
But to that point, instead of
always asking "Where's Waldo?"

12:43.512 --> 12:46.890
maybe some of you should've been
asking "How's Waldo?"

12:46.891 --> 12:48.559
Good day.

12:53.355 --> 12:55.231
Glenn, Ida, it's so nice

12:55.232 --> 12:57.317
that you could both
come over for dinner.

12:57.318 --> 12:59.068
Thanks so much for having us.

12:59.069 --> 13:00.529
(phone vibrates)

13:03.407 --> 13:05.742
No response from Peter.
What the hell?

13:05.743 --> 13:07.702
I thought we were
going to the Clam.

13:07.703 --> 13:10.246
And Quagmire just
texted back "Can't."

13:10.247 --> 13:11.706
I don't like it.

13:11.707 --> 13:14.125
They're doing something
without us.

13:14.126 --> 13:17.837
So, Brian, what's, uh,
what's new in your world?

13:17.838 --> 13:20.006
(clears throat)
Oh, well, um,

13:20.007 --> 13:21.883
thank you for asking, Lois.

13:21.884 --> 13:23.968
- I see them.
- They're both in there.

13:23.969 --> 13:25.678
Looks like a dinner party!

13:25.679 --> 13:29.223
Uh, actually, I have some news
that happens to pertain

13:29.224 --> 13:31.267
- to my dating life.
- Really, Brian?

13:31.268 --> 13:33.311
- Oh, do tell us.
- I knew it!

13:33.312 --> 13:35.855
Well, it's kind of big news.

13:35.856 --> 13:37.607
Those scalloped potatoes?

13:37.608 --> 13:39.317
Well, what's the big news?

13:39.318 --> 13:41.736
Go ahead, Brian. Tell him.

13:41.737 --> 13:43.738
Ida and I...

13:43.739 --> 13:45.615
have, uh...

13:45.616 --> 13:46.950
begun dating.

13:46.951 --> 13:49.661
You're, you're joking, right?

13:49.662 --> 13:52.288
It's true, son.
Brian and I are in love.

13:52.289 --> 13:54.791
What?! When were you gonna
tell me this?

13:54.792 --> 13:57.293
- (phone chimes)
- Oh, Peter just texted.

13:57.294 --> 13:59.087
He says he's stuck at work.

13:59.088 --> 14:03.300
(sighs) They are working
that poor man to death.

14:08.597 --> 14:11.516
I'm so glad you dropped in.
Brian is cooking breakfast.

14:11.517 --> 14:14.227
That's right, get ready
for Eggs a la Brian.

14:14.228 --> 14:16.771
Scrambled eggs
with a side of toast.

14:16.772 --> 14:19.732
What? How is that "a la Brian"?
That, that's just...

14:19.733 --> 14:22.402
That's, that's great.
That's just great, Brian.

14:22.403 --> 14:25.405
I am very excited
for this unique breakfast.

14:25.406 --> 14:28.074
Cool, cool. How many globs
of ketchup do you want?

14:28.075 --> 14:29.534
Uh, chef's choice.

14:29.535 --> 14:33.705
So, um, how long
has this been going on, Dad?

14:33.706 --> 14:36.833
Listen, Glenn, I know
this is an adjustment for you,

14:36.834 --> 14:39.711
and you and Brian haven't
always seen eye to eye.

14:39.712 --> 14:41.337
Well, I wouldn't say that.

14:41.338 --> 14:44.716
He's just, uh, kind of
a big personality. (chuckles)

14:44.717 --> 14:46.509
So, Denver Airport.

14:46.510 --> 14:49.345
Kind of up there, huh?
Mile-high.

14:49.346 --> 14:51.639
Yeah, that is the height
of the airport.

14:51.640 --> 14:55.101
Now, O'Hare Airport,
why on the ticket is it "ORD"?

14:55.102 --> 14:57.478
Uh, it was originally called
Orchard Field.

14:57.479 --> 14:58.771
Really? Huh.

14:58.772 --> 15:01.441
Uh, so why is
Wilkes-Barre/Scranton "AVP"?

15:01.442 --> 15:03.818
I'm not gonna go through
every airport with you, Brian.

15:03.819 --> 15:06.195
You know, Glenn, Brian thought
you two could hang out

15:06.196 --> 15:08.573
this afternoon,
and I think that's a great idea.

15:08.574 --> 15:10.366
Yeah, Quagmire, what do you say?

15:10.367 --> 15:12.702
(shuddering)

15:12.703 --> 15:15.121
All right.
I guess I can do that.

15:15.122 --> 15:16.247
- Well, great.
- (oven timer chimes)

15:16.248 --> 15:17.582
Oh, the ketchup's hot.

15:17.583 --> 15:19.751
Everyone goes cold, I go hot.

15:19.752 --> 15:22.421
And that's the "a la."

15:25.382 --> 15:27.800
This sucks.
I don't want to be here.

15:27.801 --> 15:30.178
Come on, Glenn.
If I'm gonna be dating your mom,

15:30.179 --> 15:32.180
it's important that we spend
some time together.

15:32.181 --> 15:35.726
Hi, we have two guest passes
from a museum member, Ida Davis.

15:37.311 --> 15:38.853
I'm not seeing an "Ida Davis."

15:38.854 --> 15:41.230
(quietly):
Uh, try "Dan Quagmire."

15:41.231 --> 15:43.941
- "Lieutenant Dan Quagmire."
- Ah, the lieutenant.

15:43.942 --> 15:45.860
And how's he doing?
Still have his penis?

15:45.861 --> 15:47.195
No, he doesn't.

15:47.196 --> 15:49.238
And that's a weird question
to ask.

15:49.239 --> 15:51.325
I'm a weird guy,
I work at a museum.

15:53.952 --> 15:56.079
See? It's not so bad.

15:56.080 --> 15:57.663
It's like <i> Night at the Museum</i>
in here.

15:57.664 --> 15:59.332
- How?
- Well, you know,

15:59.333 --> 16:01.751
like, the guys are gonna
come to life.

16:01.752 --> 16:04.545
- Like, who?
- Um, the guys, you know?

16:04.546 --> 16:06.380
When it's, when it's nighttime.

16:06.381 --> 16:08.424
- You didn't see
the movie, did you?
- No.

16:08.425 --> 16:09.884
Why did you bring up
a reference to something

16:09.885 --> 16:11.427
you know nothing about?

16:11.428 --> 16:13.638
I-- it just,
it reminded me of, uh...

16:13.639 --> 16:15.389
Brian, don't bring up
a reference to someone

16:15.390 --> 16:16.682
whose favorite movie it is,

16:16.683 --> 16:18.601
because you'll just
embarrass yourself.

16:18.602 --> 16:20.144
That was
a natural history museum,

16:20.145 --> 16:21.813
this is a science museum.

16:21.814 --> 16:24.232
What, you think this tidal
chart's gonna come to life?

16:24.233 --> 16:26.526
You think this moon rock
is gonna walk across the room

16:26.527 --> 16:28.486
and riff brilliantly
like Robin Williams

16:28.487 --> 16:31.572
playing Teddy Roosevelt,
God rest both their souls?

16:31.573 --> 16:35.160
Be very, very careful treading
around <i> Night at the Museum.</i>

16:40.499 --> 16:43.251
Okay, let's get
this game started.

16:43.252 --> 16:45.628
- Do you believe it still fits?
- From when?

16:45.629 --> 16:48.005
Thank you for throwing
this barbecue.

16:48.006 --> 16:50.967
It's so good for the boys
to spend real time together.

16:50.968 --> 16:53.929
Okay, let's play.
Kids versus the parents.

16:55.305 --> 16:57.098
All right, we're gonna
destroy those kids.

16:57.099 --> 16:59.183
Uhp, someone's
on the wrong team.

16:59.184 --> 17:01.727
Boy, they're in such a hurry
not to be kids anymore.

17:01.728 --> 17:03.980
Your time will come, trust me.

17:03.981 --> 17:06.273
I'm older than the adults.
I'm older than all of you!

17:06.275 --> 17:08.608
It seems like that sometimes,
I bet.

17:08.609 --> 17:10.904
- Get down there, champ.
- (sighs)

17:13.615 --> 17:16.367
All right, as the one adult
on a team full of children,

17:16.367 --> 17:17.702
I'm gonna act good-natured

17:17.703 --> 17:20.246
while being subtly furious
at all your mistakes.

17:20.247 --> 17:21.830
Okay? Break on three.

17:21.832 --> 17:23.332
One, two, three...

17:23.333 --> 17:25.209
- Break!
- Football!

17:25.210 --> 17:27.545
Let's focus, Chris.
Can we just focus for a minute?

17:27.546 --> 17:30.423
And let's all face
the same direction.

17:30.424 --> 17:31.757
Okay, I'm gonna call the plays

17:31.758 --> 17:34.594
while I'm covering my mouth
with this play card.

17:34.595 --> 17:37.471
Peter, that's not a play card,
it's a Denny's menu.

17:37.472 --> 17:40.474
Let's run Moons Over My Hammy
on three.

17:40.475 --> 17:43.352
Hey, guys? Gonna need
your help over here.

17:43.353 --> 17:45.980
They got a real
All-American at QB.

17:45.981 --> 17:46.981
(quietly):
God.

17:46.982 --> 17:48.649
Down. Hut! Hut!

17:48.650 --> 17:50.234
Good hutting, Glenn.
That's my boy, hutting.

17:50.235 --> 17:51.861
Way to hut!

17:51.862 --> 17:54.572
Shut up. Stop complimenting
things that don't need it.

17:54.573 --> 17:56.700
Hike!

18:01.038 --> 18:03.915
Uh-oh, look who's on the loose.

18:03.916 --> 18:06.125
I'm gonna get you,
I'm gonna get you...

18:06.126 --> 18:08.502
Oh, no, I missed you
by total accident.

18:08.503 --> 18:11.339
Yeah! Six points, bitches.

18:11.340 --> 18:14.342
(chuckles): Whoa, that was
some great move, buddy.

18:14.343 --> 18:15.927
- (dings)
- Aw.

18:15.928 --> 18:17.595
Did you see and hear the wink?

18:17.596 --> 18:19.764
That means he did it on purpose.

18:19.765 --> 18:21.849
No, no, way.
He did it all by himself.

18:21.850 --> 18:23.017
(dings)

18:23.018 --> 18:24.227
Ah! There it is again!

18:24.228 --> 18:26.729
Brian, you're the best dad ever.

18:26.730 --> 18:28.231
What're you talking about?
I beat him.

18:28.232 --> 18:30.483
I wish I had a dad like that.

18:30.484 --> 18:32.068
Me, too, bud.

18:32.069 --> 18:34.779
Brian, you're very sweet
to do that.

18:34.780 --> 18:36.656
To do what? I'm the one
who scored the touchdown.

18:36.657 --> 18:39.742
- You sure did, Glenn.
- He's not my dad!

18:39.743 --> 18:42.745
I already have a dad, and
it's my mom! All right, Brian?

18:42.746 --> 18:44.831
Stop trying to be my dad,
you fraud.

18:47.167 --> 18:49.001
Glenn, sweetie, calm down.

18:49.002 --> 18:51.796
No, I'm not gonna calm down.
I can't take this anymore.

18:51.797 --> 18:54.006
Listen, Dad, the first time
you hooked up with Brian,

18:54.007 --> 18:55.591
it was awful, I hated it.

18:55.592 --> 18:58.344
But you were confused, you'd
just gone through a huge change,

18:58.345 --> 19:01.180
you didn't know if you had
any options, so you settled.

19:01.181 --> 19:03.683
But you're a beautiful,
intelligent woman.

19:03.684 --> 19:06.769
And now you've had time to
adjust and your choice is Brian?

19:06.770 --> 19:09.188
Why in God almighty
would you choose him?

19:09.189 --> 19:12.358
"Because I love him,"
a resolved Ida said.

19:12.359 --> 19:14.986
- I'm also a published author.
- Self-published.

19:14.987 --> 19:16.612
You're also a pompous,
pretentious,

19:16.613 --> 19:18.114
hypocritical blowhard.

19:18.115 --> 19:20.491
- Who attended Brown.
- For one semester.

19:20.492 --> 19:22.451
- You went to Brown?
- For two months.

19:22.452 --> 19:24.036
See? See, that's what I mean.

19:24.037 --> 19:25.830
His whole life is a lie.

19:25.831 --> 19:28.625
I can't take this anymore.
It's either him or me.

19:35.507 --> 19:37.633
- I choose Brian...
- Yes.

19:37.634 --> 19:39.927
...to talk to first.

19:39.928 --> 19:42.847
Brian, I've loved every minute
that we've spent together.

19:42.848 --> 19:44.473
I never thought I'd meet someone

19:44.474 --> 19:46.892
who I connected with
on so many levels,

19:46.893 --> 19:49.478
- much less an Ivy Leaguer.
- Come on...

19:49.479 --> 19:53.524
But as special as you are to me,
I have to put my son first.

19:53.525 --> 19:55.693
- But Ida...
- He's my son.

19:55.694 --> 19:57.695
I've made my decision.

19:57.696 --> 19:59.530
Bye-bye, Brian. You're history.

19:59.531 --> 20:02.908
And this time, history's
not coming back to life.

20:02.909 --> 20:04.952
<i>Night at the Museum.</i>

20:04.953 --> 20:06.370
I'm sorry, Brian.

20:06.371 --> 20:09.081
I'll never forget
what we had together.

20:09.082 --> 20:10.959
I understand.

20:13.128 --> 20:14.670
Can you guys wrap this up?

20:14.671 --> 20:17.465
I see Peter coming with some
kind of problem from the game.

20:17.466 --> 20:21.302
(crying): Quagmire, we agreed
that it was a two-hand touch,

20:21.303 --> 20:23.846
and then Chris hit me
with one hand,

20:23.847 --> 20:25.598
and I said that didn't count,

20:25.599 --> 20:27.683
but he still wouldn't
count the touchdown.

20:27.684 --> 20:29.769
So I drilled him in the head
with the ball,

20:29.770 --> 20:31.354
and now he's not moving.

20:31.355 --> 20:34.106
He can blink his eyes,
but nothing else.

20:34.107 --> 20:37.568
- So, is my dog still your dad?
- Uh, no.

20:37.569 --> 20:40.947
Chris, he said
the touchdown counts!

20:46.161 --> 20:49.413
(characters shouting over TV)

20:49.414 --> 20:51.416
(both laughing)
