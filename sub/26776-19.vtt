09:03.542 --> 09:05.177
What are you two doing here?

09:05.244 --> 09:07.013
In tuxedos.

09:07.079 --> 09:08.814
Standing over
an unconscious guy.

09:08.881 --> 09:11.284
- Uh...
- See uh we...

09:11.350 --> 09:13.119
- Are...
- Waiters.

09:13.185 --> 09:14.320
- Ugh, what?!
- Yep, we're waiters.

09:14.387 --> 09:15.721
- Ugh...

09:15.788 --> 09:17.723
- So uh yea we're
just workin' the party.

09:17.790 --> 09:20.960
- Ughhhh!
[ yelling incoherently ]

09:23.262 --> 09:24.964
- Well if you're
workin' the party,

09:25.031 --> 09:27.900
then go waiter me up a can
of cranberry mango fizzy punch.

09:27.967 --> 09:29.869
- You know, I actually
have a can of punch right here

09:29.936 --> 09:31.504
in my pocket, just come over
here and I'll give it to ya.

09:31.570 --> 09:34.640
- No, no. I will go get you
a cranberry mango fizzy punch.

09:39.111 --> 09:40.246
- How do I look?

09:40.313 --> 09:43.749
- No.

09:43.816 --> 09:46.085
- Hey, who knocked out
celebrity chef, Jeff Martin?

09:46.152 --> 09:47.320
- Ugh.

09:52.925 --> 09:55.294
- Hey, can I get a cranberry
mango fizzy punch?

09:57.330 --> 09:58.864
- Ha. Cute.

09:58.931 --> 10:01.367
- Oh, the drink's not for me.

10:01.434 --> 10:02.601
It's for my little sister.

10:02.668 --> 10:05.638
- Well I wasn't talking
about the drink.

10:06.739 --> 10:10.543
- Uh...
Whaaa...ha...

10:10.609 --> 10:13.746
w-what were you
talking about?

10:13.813 --> 10:15.081
- I was talking about you.

10:15.147 --> 10:18.451
Because I think you're cute.

10:18.517 --> 10:20.553
- [ giggles ]

10:20.619 --> 10:22.388
- Why are you dressed
like that?

10:22.455 --> 10:24.957
- Oh, I uh--I thought
it was a costume party.

10:25.024 --> 10:27.259
So I'd just come
as a cute waiter.

10:27.326 --> 10:28.861
Make it two.

10:28.928 --> 10:31.864
Unless you have to
bring that to your sister.

10:31.931 --> 10:33.966
- I really should.

10:38.304 --> 10:39.438
Where were we?

10:47.880 --> 10:49.682
- What's going on?

10:57.390 --> 11:00.159
Man, after a lifetime
of working these parties,

11:00.226 --> 11:02.328
they all start to look the same.
Am I right?

11:02.395 --> 11:04.997
- Nope.

11:05.064 --> 11:07.166
- Yeah no,
you gotta stay sharp...

11:07.233 --> 11:09.835
stay focused...
totally agree...

11:09.902 --> 11:13.806
Say, you seen Mob Boss,
Rob Moss around?

11:13.873 --> 11:17.243
The real one?
I'm asking for a friend.

11:17.309 --> 11:19.512
- Nope.

11:19.578 --> 11:21.013
- 'Kay got me,

11:21.080 --> 11:23.783
I'm asking for myself.

11:23.849 --> 11:25.818
So have you seen him?

11:28.187 --> 11:30.823
- Nope.

11:30.890 --> 11:32.358
- You sure do like that word.

11:39.265 --> 11:42.835
- Yeah...
so, I'm in a band.

11:42.902 --> 11:44.437
- No you're not.
- I know.

11:44.503 --> 11:48.340
But uh, yeah I think
I'd be really good in one.

11:48.407 --> 11:51.977
So you should come check us out.
When we exist.

11:52.044 --> 11:54.680
- Where's my cranberry
mango fizzy punch?

11:54.747 --> 11:57.149
- Hey, Piper.
- Hey, Joss.

11:57.216 --> 11:58.717
Love your dress.

11:58.784 --> 12:00.152
- Thank you.

12:00.219 --> 12:01.487
I'm gonna wear it once
then throw it away.

12:01.554 --> 12:03.656
[ both laugh ]

12:03.722 --> 12:05.057
- Ha ha ha, yeah

12:05.124 --> 12:06.459
you should probably
wear it more than once

12:06.525 --> 12:08.160
but I'm sorry backing up
here real quick--

12:08.227 --> 12:09.562
what uh--what'd you say
your name was again?

12:09.628 --> 12:10.696
Hmmm?
Joss?

12:10.763 --> 12:12.565
Hmmm? Joss?

12:12.631 --> 12:14.333
- Joss Moss.

12:14.400 --> 12:16.135
- Joss Moss...

12:16.202 --> 12:18.637
daughter of Mob Boss Rob Moss,
Joss Moss?

12:18.704 --> 12:20.039
- That's right.

12:20.106 --> 12:22.408
- Hey.
Waiter.

12:22.475 --> 12:25.010
Still waiting
for my cran-man-fizz-pu.

12:25.077 --> 12:26.745
- Ladies and gentleman,

12:26.812 --> 12:28.247
please direct your attention

12:28.314 --> 12:30.916
to this special video message
from your kind host,

12:30.983 --> 12:33.919
legitimate business man
Rob Moss!

12:41.494 --> 12:42.928
- Hello, everyone.

12:42.995 --> 12:44.897
I'd like to wish
a happy birthday

12:44.964 --> 12:47.500
to my beautiful daughter,
Joss,

12:47.566 --> 12:50.436
on her sweet sixteen,

12:50.503 --> 12:53.906
the most important of
all the girl birthdays.

12:53.973 --> 12:56.175
[ applause ]

12:58.844 --> 13:02.047
Unfortunately,
due to a misunderstanding

13:02.114 --> 13:04.116
with the Swellview
Police Department

13:04.183 --> 13:08.220
regarding a number of crimes
I definitely did not commit,

13:08.287 --> 13:10.289
I'm unable
to be there in person.

13:10.356 --> 13:13.259
- Aw, come on!

13:13.325 --> 13:15.961
I got all dressed up like
a stupid waiter--

13:16.028 --> 13:17.463
no offense--

13:17.530 --> 13:18.964
and the guy's not even here.

13:19.031 --> 13:20.299
I mean how am I supposed
to go undercover

13:20.366 --> 13:22.234
and bust this guy
if he's not even here?!

13:22.301 --> 13:24.103
I mean...I can't punch
a hologram, can I?

13:24.170 --> 13:25.804
- Nope.

13:25.871 --> 13:28.407
- Eh, there's that word again.

13:28.474 --> 13:31.143
- So...
you're here to bust Rob Moss?

13:31.210 --> 13:33.179
- Oh what,
now you can say things?

13:35.648 --> 13:38.317
- Joss, I'm sorry about tonight.

13:38.384 --> 13:41.453
But I do have
a surprise for you.

13:45.157 --> 13:48.661
Surprise!
I'm here!

13:48.727 --> 13:50.296
- Dad!

14:09.548 --> 14:11.350
- You're not really a waiter,
are you?

14:11.417 --> 14:15.020
- Nope.
- You lied to me.

14:15.087 --> 14:18.691
- Take him to the beatin' room.

14:18.757 --> 14:20.659
- Well I don't like
the sound a that...

14:31.537 --> 14:33.505
- Did you guys see that?
- Yeah.

14:33.572 --> 14:36.709
Joss just got
a diamond tennis bracelet...

14:36.775 --> 14:37.943
- Gorgeous.

14:38.010 --> 14:39.845
- No!
Ray just got dragged off

14:39.912 --> 14:42.047
by three huge Mob Boss
Rob Moss lookalikes!

14:42.114 --> 14:43.215
- [ gasps ]
- Yeah!

14:43.282 --> 14:44.883
- That's a Gherkin bag!

14:44.950 --> 14:46.852
Joss just got a Gherkin bag!

14:46.919 --> 14:47.953
- Gorgeous.

14:48.020 --> 14:49.622
- You guys...

14:49.688 --> 14:51.223
- You want me
to steal that Gherkin bag?

14:51.290 --> 14:52.658
- Yes.
- YOU GUYS.

14:52.725 --> 14:54.393
- Her dad probably
stole it first.

14:54.460 --> 14:56.195
It's not stealing if
you steal from a criminal.

14:56.262 --> 14:57.730
- Not accurate, but I like
what you're laying down.

14:57.796 --> 14:59.898
- Can we please just focus
on what happened to Ray?!

14:59.965 --> 15:02.468
- He's indestructible.
I'm sure he's fine.

15:05.971 --> 15:08.807
- Ahhhhhhhhh!

15:08.874 --> 15:11.744
[ relieved ]
Ahhhh...

15:11.810 --> 15:13.846
Ahhhhh!

15:13.912 --> 15:15.547
Ahhhhh...

15:15.614 --> 15:18.417
- Yeah, you're right,
I'm sure he's fine.

15:22.054 --> 15:23.922
- Oh, daddy!

15:23.989 --> 15:25.724
How did you know?!

15:27.626 --> 15:30.162
- Excuse me, honey.
I gotta go take care of...

15:30.229 --> 15:32.164
a charity thing.

15:37.169 --> 15:38.904
- Rob Moss on the move.

15:38.971 --> 15:41.407
Gherkin bag still in place.

15:41.473 --> 15:43.175
- On it.

15:43.242 --> 15:44.677
- Did you see
where they took Ray?

15:44.743 --> 15:48.113
- Yeah, but there's
a big ugly dude

15:48.180 --> 15:49.615
guarding a secret passage...

15:49.682 --> 15:53.118
...which I gotta say
is pretty cool.

15:53.185 --> 15:54.720
- You know what's pretty cool?

15:54.787 --> 15:57.089
A Christian LaBoutin
dog carrier

15:57.156 --> 15:59.958
that I didn't even
know existed!

16:00.025 --> 16:03.262
- I think I can get in there,
just need a distraction.

16:03.329 --> 16:05.631
- Have you seen what
Joss is opening up there?

16:05.698 --> 16:06.965
- Henry!
- Eeek!

16:07.032 --> 16:08.634
Where's my cranberry
mango fizzy punch?!

16:08.701 --> 16:10.302
- Umm, I'm gonna--
- Y'know what, forget it.

16:10.369 --> 16:11.970
I'm going to talk
to your manager.

16:12.037 --> 16:13.405
- No, don't, don't,
don't, don't do that.

16:13.472 --> 16:14.807
Okay, I'm gonna
get you the punch.

16:14.873 --> 16:17.076
- Will you? 'Cause I
heard that from you,

16:17.142 --> 16:18.777
like, ten minutes ago.

16:18.844 --> 16:21.146
- You're sooo...

16:21.213 --> 16:22.748
- Here you go.

16:22.815 --> 16:24.717
- Thank you, Charlotte.

16:28.354 --> 16:29.988
- Okay, I just need
to create a distraction.

16:30.055 --> 16:31.323
- Just did.
- What?

16:31.390 --> 16:32.925
- I gave her a soda.

16:32.991 --> 16:34.493
Shaken, not stirred.

16:36.795 --> 16:40.165
- Ahhhh!

16:42.067 --> 16:44.403
- Ooooh!

16:50.542 --> 16:53.345
- And guess what else,
Mob Boss Rob Moss.

16:53.412 --> 16:54.780
When I get out of this thing

16:54.847 --> 16:57.082
I'm gonna break you into
a million stupid pieces.

16:57.149 --> 16:59.118
- I'm not Rob Moss.

16:59.184 --> 17:01.553
- Really.

17:02.855 --> 17:04.790
Huh...

17:04.857 --> 17:08.026
And guess what else,
Mob Boss Rob Moss?

17:08.093 --> 17:09.194
When I get off this thing--

17:09.261 --> 17:11.763
- I'm not Rob Moss, either.

17:11.829 --> 17:13.866
- Gah.

17:13.932 --> 17:16.468
Okay, listen, there's a pair
of glasses in my pocket.

17:16.535 --> 17:18.002
If one of you would
just be a lamb and--

17:18.069 --> 17:20.372
- Oh!

17:20.439 --> 17:23.008
Somebody shut this guy up!

17:23.075 --> 17:24.542
- Mob Boss Rob Moss?

17:24.609 --> 17:26.712
- Yeah.

17:26.779 --> 17:28.213
- I knew it!

17:30.416 --> 17:32.384
- Did somebody say, 'Danger?'

17:32.451 --> 17:34.720
- No...
- What are you talkin about?

17:34.787 --> 17:35.888
- No!

17:35.954 --> 17:38.457
- Oh, well if one
of you said it...

17:38.524 --> 17:40.359
my entrance would
have been cool.

17:40.426 --> 17:41.860
- Hey Kid Danger!

17:41.927 --> 17:44.062
- Hello random citizen.
I'm here to save you.

17:44.129 --> 17:45.531
- That's great but was actually
just about to save myself, so...

17:45.597 --> 17:47.499
- Oh, you were gonna save
yourself?

17:47.566 --> 17:49.067
- Uh, I was workin' on it--
- Oh okay, I'll just leave then.

17:49.134 --> 17:50.702
- Well I didn't say that.
- Well if you're gonna--

17:50.769 --> 17:52.304
- You came all
the way down here...

17:52.371 --> 17:56.542
- Will someone please
take care of this kid?!

17:56.608 --> 17:58.243
I love when this happens.

17:58.310 --> 18:00.379
It's like I get to watch
a whole bunch of me's

18:00.446 --> 18:03.081
beat people up.

18:03.148 --> 18:07.219
- You seem like a real gunch.

18:07.286 --> 18:10.255
- Hey, Mr. Moss?

18:10.322 --> 18:13.225
Does your daughter
have a boyfriend?

18:13.292 --> 18:14.793
- What?!

18:18.831 --> 18:22.267
- 'Cause I saw her talking
to this really handsome guy

18:22.334 --> 18:23.936
who's in a band--
- Are you kidding me?!

18:24.002 --> 18:26.738
- Alright, you got me...
he's not in a band.

18:26.805 --> 18:28.340
But he's thinkin'
about starting one.

18:34.980 --> 18:36.949
- You spit on me?!

18:37.015 --> 18:38.450
- Sure did.

18:38.517 --> 18:39.551
- That's disgusting!

18:39.618 --> 18:41.053
- You're trying to cook me!

18:41.119 --> 18:42.221
- Fair enough.

18:42.287 --> 18:44.189
Also, I'm leaving.

18:44.256 --> 18:46.525
- What? You can't leave,
I'm about to win this fight!

18:46.592 --> 18:49.294
- Yeah, that's why I'm leaving.

18:53.098 --> 18:54.566
Move!
Outta my way!

18:54.633 --> 18:56.869
If you can chew you can shoo!

19:11.116 --> 19:12.317
- Alright, I'll be back.

19:12.384 --> 19:13.485
- Where you going?

19:13.552 --> 19:14.653
- I gotta go get
Mob Boss Rob Moss.

19:14.720 --> 19:17.155
- Want me to cuff him for you?

19:17.222 --> 19:18.624
Or should I say...

19:18.690 --> 19:20.392
cuff link him for you?

19:20.459 --> 19:22.427
- I don't know what that means.

19:22.494 --> 19:24.630
- Daddy, you can't leave yet.

19:24.696 --> 19:26.498
- I'm sorry, honey, I got--

19:31.003 --> 19:32.337
[ crowd claps ]

19:52.858 --> 19:54.960
- Never tell Schwoz how helpful
these cuff links were.

19:55.027 --> 19:56.128
- Of course not.

19:56.194 --> 19:57.863
Ah, I gotta get
back out to the party.

19:57.930 --> 19:59.865
Ahh I--I forgot
about the butt taste.

19:59.932 --> 20:02.434
Ahh. I don't like it.
Ehh.

20:12.945 --> 20:14.413
- Bye.

20:15.781 --> 20:17.049
- Bye Joss.
- Great party.

20:17.115 --> 20:18.383
- Had so much fun.
- Thanks for having us.

20:18.450 --> 20:19.484
- Is that my Gherkin bag?

20:19.551 --> 20:22.387
- Bye, Joss.
- Great party.

20:22.454 --> 20:24.723
- Hey!
What's up Joss!

20:24.790 --> 20:26.992
Hey I was just in the bathroom
for like a really long time.

20:27.059 --> 20:28.794
Not for like
a gross reason though.

20:28.860 --> 20:31.063
For like a totally normal reason
that someone would do that.

20:31.129 --> 20:33.198
What's up with you uh?
What'd I miss?

20:33.265 --> 20:34.566
How's it going?
Hmm? What's up?

20:34.633 --> 20:36.068
- Well you missed a lot.

20:36.134 --> 20:38.370
Okay, I got a diamond
tennis bracelet.

20:38.437 --> 20:39.671
- I--I saw that.

20:39.738 --> 20:42.174
- Someone just stole my Gherkin.
- Bummer.

20:42.240 --> 20:44.576
- And my dad's
on his way back to prison.

20:44.643 --> 20:47.479
- Uh, happy birthday?

20:49.314 --> 20:50.415
- Hey, I never got your name.

20:50.482 --> 20:52.250
- Yeah, it's Hart.

20:52.317 --> 20:55.320
Henry Hart.

20:55.387 --> 20:57.556
- The way you said
that was weird.

20:57.623 --> 21:00.258
Very weird.

21:00.325 --> 21:03.095
- Hey man I was in the bathroom
for like an hour!

21:03.161 --> 21:04.997
Not for a gross reason, though.
- It's okay...

21:05.063 --> 21:06.665
- But I don't even know
what this guy's doin'.

21:06.732 --> 21:09.201
- It's fine. He's here for me.
- Oh.

21:09.267 --> 21:11.036
- I need to discuss
who's going to take over

21:11.103 --> 21:13.605
my father's very
legitimate business.

21:15.340 --> 21:19.444
- Is your father's business
legitimate though?

21:19.511 --> 21:22.848
- Never ask me about
my business, Henry.

21:34.860 --> 21:36.461
- Party's over pal--
let's get outta here.

21:36.528 --> 21:39.097
- Yeah, hang on a second.

21:46.438 --> 21:48.306
- Buddy, we gotta go.

21:48.373 --> 21:50.142
- Are you wearing
a diamond tennis bracelet?

21:50.208 --> 21:53.111
- Oh yeah. It's not stealing
if it's from a criminal.

21:53.178 --> 21:54.913
- Okay.

21:54.980 --> 21:57.649
Come on, let's go let's go
s'go s'go s'go...

21:57.716 --> 21:59.551
go go go go go...
