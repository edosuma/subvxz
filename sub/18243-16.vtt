Darby: Brown is
definitely carnesian.

R.J. clearly knows
a thing or two about magic.

I thought the only people
who had the book before us
were the OCs.

Clearly, there were others
in between.

Now Alyssa will never
speak to me again.

What am I supposed to do?

01:04.586 --> 01:06.544
You can start by leaving
that poor girl alone.

01:06.631 --> 01:08.938
It's been decades, man.
Move on.

01:09.025 --> 01:10.722
He's right.
And after that,

01:10.809 --> 01:12.724
you can give back
our book.

01:12.811 --> 01:15.162
Oh, you mean my book?

You stole it
from us. Remember?

Hey, I had it first.
Found it in high school,

lifted it.

on its own.

Yeah.
It chooses when it leaves,
and who it goes to next.

01:27.435 --> 01:28.740
Whatever,
I don't really care.

01:28.827 --> 01:31.874
The point is,
I have the book now,

01:31.961 --> 01:33.963

a touch spell.

that kind of magic existed.

good at baking,

03:33.213 --> 03:34.823
We need to get
our book back.

03:34.910 --> 03:36.303
Which means we're
gonna have to cook.

03:36.390 --> 03:37.739
Since those two things
go together,

03:37.826 --> 03:39.219
that's gonna be hard.

03:39.306 --> 03:41.003
You're right.
Especially since RJ's

03:41.090 --> 03:42.961
not gonna eat
anything we give him.

03:43.048 --> 03:44.746
Maybe we don't
need to feed him.

03:44.833 --> 03:47.357
Remember when we cooked
the Last Ditch Layer Cake?

03:47.444 --> 03:49.446
The recipe got written
into the book.

03:49.533 --> 03:50.752
You're right.

03:50.839 --> 03:52.057
Every spell
a protector creates

03:52.144 --> 03:53.668
shows up in the book.

03:53.755 --> 03:56.714
Right.
So if we create
our own riddle,

03:56.801 --> 03:58.238
it will appear
in the book.

03:58.325 --> 03:59.978
And since RJ has the book,
that means--

04:00.065 --> 04:01.545
RJ will see it.
So cool.

04:01.632 --> 04:03.112
But we have to be
smart about it.

04:03.199 --> 04:05.201
We have to make something
that RJ would cook,

04:05.288 --> 04:06.637
and eat himself.

04:06.724 --> 04:08.639
Something that would make him
give us the book.

04:08.726 --> 04:12.687
Kinda like a "give up
what you want" spell.

04:12.774 --> 04:15.472
But RJ would never
cook that.

04:15.559 --> 04:17.692

Hopefully, this time
it won't be any different.

But how would we know
what RJ would cook?

04:28.137 --> 04:30.487
Well, he's been
pretty selfish so far.

04:30.574 --> 04:33.360
How about a spell
for a new car?

04:33.447 --> 04:36.145
Maybe we should leave
a more open-ended, like,

04:36.232 --> 04:37.494
"get whatever you want"?

04:37.581 --> 04:39.061

the riddles?

21:10.573 --> 21:12.532
That explains whey they're
sometimes so cryptic.

21:12.619 --> 21:14.925
But how did
your spell break?

21:15.012 --> 21:17.014
"When you eat
a gumdrop or two,

21:17.101 --> 21:19.408
"say goodbye to
belongings and greed,

21:19.495 --> 21:21.149
"but when you give up
what you want,

21:21.236 --> 21:23.673
"you might just get
what you need."

21:23.760 --> 21:26.023
Get what you need?
That's it.

21:26.110 --> 21:29.288
Your spell broke because
you got what you needed.

21:29.375 --> 21:32.029
I needed to learn that
I can't do everything
on my own.

21:32.116 --> 21:34.728
Man, it's freaky
how much that book knows.

21:34.815 --> 21:36.512
[chuckles]

21:37.948 --> 21:40.299
- [bell jingles]
- Hey.

21:40.386 --> 21:42.649
- What are you doing here?
We're closed.
- Where are the girls?

21:42.736 --> 21:46.392
- Look, I'm not gonna--
- I have to talk to them
right now.

21:46.479 --> 21:47.610
We're all in danger.

21:49.612 --> 21:51.048
- [door opens]
- [bell jingles]

21:51.135 --> 21:53.268
What's going on?
What do you want, RJ?

21:53.355 --> 21:55.226
We don't have the book
so don't get any ideas.

21:55.314 --> 21:57.707
I don't want anything
to do with the book.

21:57.794 --> 22:00.493
Someone knows about
the magic--

22:01.668 --> 22:03.496
Who? Who knows about
the magic?

22:05.454 --> 22:06.673
I-- I'm sorry,
what?

22:06.760 --> 22:07.891
You said we're in danger

22:07.978 --> 22:09.763
because somebody
knows about the magic.

22:09.850 --> 22:11.765
If this is a ploy
to get the cookbook
then--

22:11.852 --> 22:13.767
Uh, why would I want--

22:13.854 --> 22:16.944
Uh, I have never owned
a cookbook in my life.

22:17.031 --> 22:19.120
Dude, you were
just freaking out
a minute ago.

22:19.207 --> 22:20.295
You don't remember?

22:20.382 --> 22:23.603
I'm sorry.
Is this a joke?

22:23.690 --> 22:26.954
So, you don't remember
the magic?

22:27.041 --> 22:28.651
Or the cookbook?

22:28.738 --> 22:30.131
You know what?

22:30.218 --> 22:31.959
I don't have time for this.

22:36.311 --> 22:38.966
[bell jingles]

22:39.053 --> 22:41.447
What just happened?

22:41.534 --> 22:44.493
RJ couldn't just
forget everything.

22:44.580 --> 22:46.539
- Not unless he was--
- Cursed.

22:46.626 --> 22:48.410
But why would someone
spell RJ

22:48.497 --> 22:50.325
so that he'd
forget about the magic?

22:50.412 --> 22:51.457
I don't know.

22:51.544 --> 22:54.198
Someone's out there.

22:54.285 --> 22:55.504
And they're dangerous.
