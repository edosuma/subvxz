WEBVTT

00:25.403 --> 00:28.322
Fergal, how did you get in?

00:28.406 --> 00:32.785
The usual way,
through the front door.

00:32.869 --> 00:36.873
I'm not sure if I approve of
you sneaking in here and
making me breakfast.

00:36.956 --> 00:38.916
I know.

00:39.000 --> 00:42.295
I am the headmistress of the
local school. I've got my
reputation to think of.

00:42.378 --> 00:44.881
Sweetheart, we're five miles
from the nearest town

00:44.964 --> 00:47.175
and hundreds of miles
from civilization.

00:47.258 --> 00:48.968
Who's even going
to know I'm here?

00:49.052 --> 00:50.970
(KNOCKING)

00:55.475 --> 00:57.518
Good morning.
I've got two letters for you.

00:57.602 --> 01:00.897
This one looks official,
and one for Fergal.
Airmail, too.

01:00.980 --> 01:02.357
For Fergal?

01:02.440 --> 01:04.566
Oh, well, seeing as he's here
all the time these days,

01:04.649 --> 01:06.986
I thought I would
drop off his post.

01:07.070 --> 01:08.488
Thank you, Craig.

01:08.571 --> 01:10.907
So long. So long, Fergal.

01:10.990 --> 01:13.076
FERGAL: Yeah, so long, Craig.

01:23.461 --> 01:25.713
Okay. So Craig knows.

01:25.797 --> 01:28.132
It'll be all over
Glenbogle in half an hour.

01:28.216 --> 01:31.010
Could go after him,
let his tyres down.

01:32.929 --> 01:35.264
What's wrong? Who's it from?

01:36.641 --> 01:38.601
The Education Authority.

01:39.769 --> 01:42.146
Are they onto us already?

01:42.230 --> 01:45.358
-They're actually shutting it.
-Shutting what?

01:45.441 --> 01:49.529
The school, Fergal.
They're closing
down my school.

02:33.156 --> 02:37.368
I don't see why
there has to be
a religious ceremony involved.

02:44.375 --> 02:46.377
They're still at it.

02:46.461 --> 02:49.005
Did you not hear what they
were talking about when you
brought in their coffee?

02:49.088 --> 02:52.008
As Glenbogle housekeeper,
I have taken
a solemn vow of silence.

02:52.091 --> 02:53.426
I hadn't noticed.

02:53.509 --> 02:55.928
Actually, Archie's thinking of
having you committed.

02:56.012 --> 02:57.972
Just needs another
signature for the form.

02:58.056 --> 03:00.475
-Is the minister still here?
-Yeah. What's going on?

03:00.558 --> 03:04.729
I shouldn't say anything
really, but I did hear
them mention marriage.

03:04.812 --> 03:09.984
-I didn't like to eavesdrop.
-You're his mother.
You're meant to eavesdrop.

03:10.068 --> 03:12.028
(ARCHIE LAUGHING)

03:31.005 --> 03:35.093
Not at all, Archie. I
look forward to the big day.
See you Sunday.

03:53.486 --> 03:55.196
-Oh, Archie.
-Hiya.

03:55.279 --> 03:57.073
-Hello.
-Hi.

03:57.156 --> 03:59.701
I haven't seen
a shiftier bunch of characters
outside a police line-up.

03:59.784 --> 04:01.536
Who, dear? Us?

04:01.619 --> 04:05.623
Well, I'm glad you're all here
because I have
an announcement to make.

04:05.707 --> 04:08.793
There's going to be
a wedding at Glenbogle.

04:09.335 --> 04:11.462
Oh.

04:11.546 --> 04:15.091
-Who's the lucky girl, then?
-She's from Glasgow.
You don't know her.

04:15.174 --> 04:17.760
Archie, you are a dark horse.

04:17.844 --> 04:23.599
Archie, I am delighted for y
ou. When are your father
and I going to meet her?

04:23.683 --> 04:28.061
No, no, no. Wait, it's not me.
I'm not the one
who's getting married.

04:28.146 --> 04:30.940
Oh, well.
You better start again, then.

04:31.024 --> 04:34.902
Well, look, it occurred to me
that Glenbogle would make a
great venue for weddings.

04:34.986 --> 04:38.906
-All we need is
the minister's permission.
-Ah, right.

04:38.990 --> 04:43.077
We could go for a homely,
intimate affair. Lexie,
you could run the catering.

04:43.161 --> 04:46.414
Mother,
you could do the flowers.
Duncan, you could be factotum.

04:46.497 --> 04:50.418
-Golly, you could provide the
game and... -And Hector could
look after the car park.

04:50.501 --> 04:52.420
Oh, that is a fantastic idea!

04:52.503 --> 04:55.923
Hear that? Factotum.

04:56.007 --> 04:57.759
That's Latin for "gofer".

04:57.842 --> 05:00.720
In fact,
we have our first couple
arriving this afternoon.

05:00.803 --> 05:04.265
-Already?
-Pamela McAlpine and
Eric Morton from Glasgow.

05:04.349 --> 05:07.935
Apparently they're rolling in
it so if we impress them
and the word gets around...

05:08.019 --> 05:10.146
I'm off to
sharpen my secateurs.

05:10.229 --> 05:13.358
-I'm off to iron my kilt.
-Mind you take it off first.

05:13.441 --> 05:19.489
-Have you thought about music?
-Ah, yes. Well,
maybe by special request.

05:19.572 --> 05:24.535
You want Scottish, Archie.
You need the pipes.

05:24.619 --> 05:29.332
-Um...not everyone
likes bagpipes, Golly.
-Well, I could educate them.

05:33.670 --> 05:35.296
(DOORBELL RINGING)

05:44.681 --> 05:47.141
Hello. How are you?

05:47.225 --> 05:49.894
Unemployed. Is Hector here?

05:51.437 --> 05:54.107
They're closing
down the school
at the end of the term.

05:54.190 --> 05:57.193
They want to bus the kids
over to the new big
school at Glenmoriston.

05:57.276 --> 05:58.985
That's miles away.

05:59.070 --> 06:01.155
We're just on the edge
of the catchment
area apparently.

06:01.239 --> 06:04.075
They've been talking about it
for ages but I never
believed it would happen.

06:04.158 --> 06:05.827
Who would? It's insane!

06:05.910 --> 06:08.788
We need Hector at the meeting.
He's on
the board of governors.

06:08.871 --> 06:10.623
He'll be there, and
so will the laird.

06:10.707 --> 06:13.292
I don't think your
title will count for much.

06:13.376 --> 06:15.962
Fine, I'll come as
Archie MacDonald.

06:16.045 --> 06:18.089
We need all
the help we can get.

06:18.172 --> 06:21.259
They're sending
down some spin doctor
from the Board of Education.

06:21.342 --> 06:26.014
Well, we'll hand him
his head in a basket.
Whatever it takes, Katrina.

06:26.097 --> 06:27.807
Thanks.

06:33.688 --> 06:35.565
And you want me to
make up the numbers?

06:35.648 --> 06:39.527
I want you there to
make your voice heard,
as a member of the community.

06:39.610 --> 06:42.030
I've only been
here a few months.

06:42.113 --> 06:45.491
Fergal, what are you
building the hide for exactly?

06:45.575 --> 06:49.162
If the school closes,
it'll be empty
most of the year.

06:49.245 --> 06:54.042
I just... I can't, okay?
I have to
disappear for a few days.

06:54.125 --> 06:55.793
-What for?
-It's important to me.

06:55.877 --> 06:58.004
What's more
important than this?

06:58.087 --> 07:02.633
You'll be fine, okay?
One way or another,
things will work out.

07:05.636 --> 07:07.972
I know how much
this means to you.

07:08.056 --> 07:13.144
Yeah, well, if I knew how
little it meant to you, I
wouldn't have bothered asking.

07:14.896 --> 07:17.857
Katrina...

07:17.940 --> 07:20.693
Why can't these people
just go to Gretna
Green like everyone else?

07:20.777 --> 07:23.738
We're aiming for
a rather more
upmarket clientele, Father.

07:23.821 --> 07:27.325
Never heard of this chap
Morton. One of these nouveau
riche johnnies, I suppose.

07:27.408 --> 07:29.786
Make all their money
out of arms
dealing and pornography.

07:29.869 --> 07:33.081
Whereas we made ours
from stealing sheep
and subjugating the peasants.

07:33.164 --> 07:36.959
You've been spending too much
time with that lefty
schoolteacher of yours.

07:37.043 --> 07:39.003
Everyone ready?

07:39.087 --> 07:40.463
Where's Golly?

07:40.546 --> 07:42.382
(BAGPIPES PLAYING)

07:50.973 --> 07:53.393
It's never too early to
start their education, Archie.

07:53.476 --> 07:55.978
Golly, they specifically
asked for no pipes.

07:56.062 --> 07:58.272
-And you agreed?
-The customer is always right.

07:58.356 --> 07:59.482
The customer's
a cloth-eared loon!

07:59.565 --> 08:01.943
Just put them back
in the house, please.

08:05.238 --> 08:09.075
Okay, remember everyone,
this could be a real
earner for Glenbogle.

08:09.158 --> 08:12.286
The keynote is
intimate and sophisticated.

08:28.386 --> 08:30.596
Miss McAlpine,
welcome to Glenbogle.

08:30.680 --> 08:35.308
Oh, you must be Archie.
You've got the looks
to go with the voice.

08:35.393 --> 08:38.980
-Duncan will help
you with your bags.
-Oh! No need. Eric's onto it.

08:39.063 --> 08:42.066
-No, no, please...
-No, really.
He likes to keep busy.

08:42.150 --> 08:44.193
And this must be your staff.

08:44.277 --> 08:46.738
Um...my family.

08:46.821 --> 08:49.073
-Hector MacDonald, my father.
-Delighted.

08:49.157 --> 08:55.288
Oh! He's got a twinkle in his
eye. I bet you're always
chasing after the maids, eh?

08:55.371 --> 08:58.624
Certainly not.
At my age,
it's safer to ambush them.

09:01.753 --> 09:03.838
-This is my mother.
-Molly MacDonald.

09:03.921 --> 09:09.135
Welcome to Glenbogle,
Ms McAlpine. We promise you
the most delightful wedding.

09:09.218 --> 09:14.557
Oh, lovely.
But I'm not a "Ms".
Just call me Pamela... Ooh!

09:14.640 --> 09:18.227
-Who is this?
-I'm Golly, Miss McAlpine.
The gillie.

09:18.311 --> 09:22.440
-Oh.
You look after the fishing?
-Amongst other duties, yes.

09:22.523 --> 09:24.400
I love the kilt.

09:24.484 --> 09:28.196
See, if my luck's in, the wind
picks up, I'll get to
inspect your tackle.

09:32.367 --> 09:34.577
-Perhaps you'd like to...
-This way.

09:34.660 --> 09:36.537
Oh! Certainly.

09:39.415 --> 09:43.711
-Upmarket clientele, eh?
-I know, you think she's
a little...plainspoken.

09:43.795 --> 09:47.924
Plainspoken? Got a mind like
a midden and a mouth like
a highland bog.

09:48.007 --> 09:50.593
And I like her already.

09:50.677 --> 09:55.306
I started off with a wee cafe
in Garnethill. All-day
breakfast, that sort of thing.

09:55.390 --> 09:58.893
-And you expanded from there?
-Not really, no.

09:58.976 --> 10:01.813
My uncle died and left
me a shedload of money.

10:01.896 --> 10:06.359
Pamela's been my waitress
these past four years. Keeps
the punters on their toes.

10:06.442 --> 10:09.904
She's a terrible flirt,
but a heart of gold.

10:09.987 --> 10:13.116
I never had
the nerve to pop the question
till my ship came in.

10:13.199 --> 10:15.410
Who says money can't
buy you happiness, eh?

10:15.493 --> 10:19.372
Tea up.
And coffee, and scones.

10:19.455 --> 10:21.708
This is Lexie,
our housekeeper.

10:21.791 --> 10:25.878
-Now, what will you be having?
-PAMELA:
Same as always, Lexie.

10:25.962 --> 10:29.007
-Lexie?
-That's my gawky wee girl.

10:30.675 --> 10:33.386
-Hello, Mum.
-Mum?

10:33.469 --> 10:36.431
-Surprise.
-Good Lord!

10:36.514 --> 10:39.058
-I'm sorry I don't...
-I heard you
got a job up here.

10:39.142 --> 10:43.771
I saw Archie's advert and I
thought, "That's the very
place I want to get married."

10:43.855 --> 10:49.527
Oh, really?
We'll have to fit
a revolving door then, eh?

10:49.610 --> 10:54.449
Lexie, I'm Eric.
It's a joy to meet you.
I thought you'd be younger.

10:54.532 --> 10:57.827
Aye, well, maths was never
your strong point, honey.

10:57.910 --> 11:01.622
Well, you two must have
lots of catching up to do.

11:01.706 --> 11:04.083
Not really, no.

11:04.167 --> 11:07.295
-Excuse me.
-ARCHIE: Lexie...

11:09.422 --> 11:11.007
Kids, hey?

11:13.634 --> 11:15.720
Lexie? Where are you going?

11:15.803 --> 11:19.015
I'm just going to slip into
something more comfortable,
like a taxi to Glasgow!

11:19.098 --> 11:21.267
-What is going on between you?
-Have you got all week?

11:21.351 --> 11:23.394
No. Look, Pamela and
Eric are our guests,

11:23.478 --> 11:26.481
which means we treat them
with a modicum
of civility, okay?

11:26.564 --> 11:29.400
I am going to a meeting this
evening and I need you to
look after them.

11:29.484 --> 11:32.111
So you just want me
to sit back and
think of Glenbogle?

11:32.195 --> 11:35.281
-Well, how hard can it be?
-You have no idea!

11:41.996 --> 11:45.667
And here we have
the bridal suite.

11:45.750 --> 11:49.045
Hector and I spent
our first night here,
40 years ago now.

11:49.128 --> 11:54.050
Hardly used it since.
Yes, it does smell
a little funny at first.

11:54.133 --> 11:56.010
Yeah, no kidding.

11:56.094 --> 11:59.806
Not to worry.
A blast of fresh air and
you'll hardly notice it.

12:01.516 --> 12:03.810
I'll try the one
in the bathroom.

12:06.688 --> 12:12.026
On second thoughts,
it is rather chilly outside.
I'll fetch some potpourri.

12:12.735 --> 12:14.195
Thank you.

12:18.074 --> 12:20.493
Sorry we're late.
Father couldn't
decide which hat to wear.

12:20.576 --> 12:22.453
So long since I've been
to one of these things.

12:22.537 --> 12:25.957
Don't worry. The guy from
the Department of
Education hasn't arrived yet.

12:26.040 --> 12:28.459
I've saved you a seat, Hector.

12:32.714 --> 12:36.551
-Andy. Andy McArdle.
-Archie!

12:36.634 --> 12:41.389
Archie, you dog, how are you?
I'd forgotten this was
your old stamping ground.

12:41.472 --> 12:43.474
-Still is.
-What are you
doing these days?

12:43.558 --> 12:45.560
Not much. I'm the laird.

12:45.643 --> 12:47.270
-No way.
-What about you?

12:47.353 --> 12:51.024
Mr McArdle is the spin doctor
for
the Department of Education.

12:51.107 --> 12:53.860
Head of media and
public relations actually.

12:53.943 --> 12:57.405
Wow! Who'd have thought it?
Jack and I were
at school together.

12:57.488 --> 12:59.574
-Jack?
-Short for Jackanory.

12:59.657 --> 13:02.410
He used to tell
the most amazingly tall tales.

13:02.493 --> 13:06.039
I can well believe it.
I've read your press release.

13:07.540 --> 13:10.001
Well, shall we get started?

13:11.919 --> 13:14.589
MAN:
Glenmoriston's 18 miles away.

13:14.672 --> 13:19.635
You can't expect parents
to drive their children
there and back every day.

13:19.719 --> 13:23.973
The local council will be
providing a bus service...
free of charge.

13:25.683 --> 13:28.102
And what about their
friends from the village?

13:28.186 --> 13:33.024
Their friends will be going
with them and they'll make new
friends at their new school.

13:33.107 --> 13:35.526
Look, this is all
missing the point.

13:35.610 --> 13:40.114
The village needs its school.
It's the focal
point of our community.

13:40.198 --> 13:42.867
Glenmoriston's school has
better facilities,

13:42.950 --> 13:46.037
better resources,
more modern buildings.

13:46.120 --> 13:48.664
Don't your
children deserve the best?

13:48.748 --> 13:54.837
Look, Jack... Mr McArdle,
our children are already
getting the best here at home.

13:54.921 --> 13:59.258
You cannot ship them
nearly 40 miles every day,
not at their age.

13:59.342 --> 14:02.804
You close the school
and pretty soon all
the families will leave,

14:02.887 --> 14:05.014
and all you'll have left here
is a ghost town.

14:05.098 --> 14:08.226
Is that really
what your department wants?

14:10.561 --> 14:13.815
Look, the decision's
not been written in stone.

14:13.898 --> 14:18.820
I'm here to consult with you
and to pass your
comments on to the department.

14:18.903 --> 14:22.198
Believe me, they'll
receive serious consideration.

14:30.456 --> 14:34.711
That was great, Archie.
Maureen and I might have a job
come September after all.

14:34.794 --> 14:36.713
I don't know if it'll
make any difference.

14:36.796 --> 14:41.050
It's got to. You really did
hand him his head in a basket,
though. Thanks.

14:41.134 --> 14:43.928
I'll mention it in
my sermon this Sunday,
get the word around.

14:44.012 --> 14:47.807
Good idea.
Spread some much needed
panic and despondency.

14:47.890 --> 14:49.684
Sorry?

14:49.767 --> 14:52.186
Let's hope they demolish
the place. We could do with
a decent car park.

14:52.270 --> 14:53.980
Father, you're
supposed to be on our side.

14:54.063 --> 14:57.066
It's time
the local brats got out of
this bible-thumping backwater.

14:57.150 --> 15:00.278
Every Sunday they're dragged
off to church and barracked
about hell and damnation!

15:00.361 --> 15:02.572
No wonder
they grow up to be
superstitious buffoons.

15:02.655 --> 15:05.575
Do 'em good to get away
from all that
religious twaddle!

15:06.576 --> 15:08.327
I'll walk home.

15:10.830 --> 15:14.000
I'm sorry, you'll have
to forgive my father.
He likes to shock.

15:14.083 --> 15:15.877
He's very good at it.

15:15.960 --> 15:18.880
Perhaps if you
want to hold weddings
at the Big House,

15:18.963 --> 15:21.424
you should find
another minister.

15:36.356 --> 15:39.984
So, your name's McAlpine now?

15:40.068 --> 15:44.280
Whirlwind romance.
Didn't work out.

15:44.364 --> 15:47.533
-So what's new.
-All that's behind me now.

15:47.617 --> 15:49.869
Let's forget
about the past, eh?

15:49.952 --> 15:53.915
All I want is for my
friends at the wedding
to see my lovely wee girl.

15:53.998 --> 15:56.709
You inviting your
old ex-boyfriends
to the wedding?

15:56.793 --> 16:00.672
-We'll have to
airlift in supplies, then.
-Don't be like that, Lex.

16:00.755 --> 16:06.552
Look, it's gonna be a special
day for all of us. A fresh
start, eh, what do you say?

16:06.636 --> 16:10.848
Look, I know I haven't been
much of a mother. I'm the only
one you've got, by the way.

16:12.392 --> 16:14.477
I know I've made mistakes.

16:15.645 --> 16:17.605
Such as?

16:17.689 --> 16:22.527
Not spending enough time with
you. I mean, I tried.
It wasn't easy.

16:22.610 --> 16:25.029
God knows I was away myself.

16:25.113 --> 16:28.199
-And you always had to be
the centre of attention.
-Me?

16:28.282 --> 16:31.786
Aye. Well,
this is gonna be my big day
and you can be a part of it.

16:31.869 --> 16:36.582
I never wanted to be
the centre of attention!
I just wanted to exist!

16:36.666 --> 16:39.877
You spent more
time fixing your hair
than you did talking to me.

16:39.961 --> 16:41.671
Don't start, Lex.

16:41.754 --> 16:43.923
You know,
you nearly had me
going there for a minute.

16:44.007 --> 16:47.218
Go ahead, forget the past.
I wish I could.

16:51.639 --> 16:54.058
Ah, have you
discussed the catering?

16:54.142 --> 16:56.936
Yep! We'll serve grass.
That's what cows eat!

16:57.020 --> 16:58.980
-Lex...
-I mean it, Arch.

16:59.063 --> 17:02.567
She's not here to get married,
she's here to humiliate me!
I'm not gonna play!

17:02.650 --> 17:06.529
Archie, where are our guests?
I rather fancy being
appalled by Lexie's mother.

17:06.612 --> 17:09.198
Yes, and while you're at it,
perhaps you
could explain to me

17:09.281 --> 17:11.742
why the Reverend Mitchell
won't be marrying them?

17:11.826 --> 17:14.328
You'll find another minister.
The hills are
crawling with them.

17:14.412 --> 17:17.540
It took me all morning to
persuade that one. What have
you got against him anyway?

17:17.623 --> 17:20.752
That pompous,
sanctimonious windbag?
Nothing whatsoever.

17:20.835 --> 17:22.670
Then you won't mind
apologising to him.

17:22.753 --> 17:26.214
Of course not. I'll tell you
what, just as soon as
the loch freezes over,

17:26.299 --> 17:29.552
I'll skate
across to his church
and say sorry, all right?

17:40.188 --> 17:42.106
(BAGPIPES PLAYING)

17:50.365 --> 17:52.533
Oh, God.

17:59.832 --> 18:02.126
Sorry, Archie.
Did I wake you?

18:02.210 --> 18:04.295
Along with the
rest of the glen, yes.

18:04.378 --> 18:07.005
It beats that Today programme,
though, eh?

18:07.090 --> 18:10.843
Golly, I've told you.
Our guests cannot
stand the bagpipes.

18:10.927 --> 18:15.056
-They haven't heard them
in their proper context.
-And they're not going to!

18:15.139 --> 18:18.851
I can do requests.
Give me a tune.
Anything you like.

18:18.935 --> 18:21.270
Can you play Far, Far Away?

18:21.354 --> 18:25.775
Far, Far Away? Right.

18:25.858 --> 18:29.070
Golly, don't just disappear.
Golly!

18:32.073 --> 18:36.494
I want one of the big,
stripy tents
to cover the whole garden,

18:36.577 --> 18:39.247
and I want an orchestra
that plays classical music.

18:39.330 --> 18:42.333
You know,
Mozart, James Galway,
that kind of thing.

18:42.417 --> 18:46.629
-An orchestra?
-Archie,
if you've got it, flaunt it.

18:46.713 --> 18:51.050
And I want lilies everywhere.
Pink and white.

18:51.134 --> 18:55.513
-I love the smell of lilies.
-They're not really
very common around here.

18:55.596 --> 18:59.183
Don't worry about it.
I know a posh place in
Edinburgh that does them.

18:59.267 --> 19:02.854
Now, cars. I want a fleet of
white Rolls-Royces

19:02.937 --> 19:05.523
to pick upall our guests
from the railway station.

19:05.606 --> 19:11.320
And then, when we leave...
I want it to be
something really spectacular.

19:11.404 --> 19:13.448
Hot air balloon?

19:13.531 --> 19:15.700
That's brilliant.

19:15.783 --> 19:20.455
You're dead good at this,
Archie. See, if I was just
a couple of years younger...

19:20.538 --> 19:24.584
-Pamela.
-Relax. I'm not married yet.

19:24.667 --> 19:26.753
Have you discussed the menu
with Lexie?

19:26.836 --> 19:28.796
No need.
We're hiring the caterers.

19:28.880 --> 19:32.133
Anyway,
Lexie will be far too busy
being my bridesmaid.

19:32.216 --> 19:35.803
-Bridesmaid? Have you
spoken to her about this?
-No, I've tried.

19:35.887 --> 19:38.639
She has a whole bag of
chips on her shoulder,
that girl.

19:38.723 --> 19:41.476
Actually,
maybe if you talked to her.

19:41.559 --> 19:44.228
Oh, I don't think
it's really my place.

19:44.312 --> 19:47.732
Go on, Archie.
Do it for me, eh?

19:47.815 --> 19:51.069
I mean, how could she resist
those big brown eyes of yours?

19:51.152 --> 19:52.987
What woman could?

19:53.905 --> 19:55.531
All right, I'll give it a go.

19:55.615 --> 19:58.951
Good. Now, the minister's
all organised, is he?

19:59.035 --> 20:01.120
Yes, yes, of course.

20:01.204 --> 20:03.331
Yes, I've already spoken to
the Reverend Mitchell,

20:03.414 --> 20:05.917
but hesuggested
I try to find somebody else.

20:06.000 --> 20:08.878
I know it's not in
your parish, but...

20:08.961 --> 20:11.714
Right.
Okay, thank you. Goodbye.

20:11.798 --> 20:14.884
-How are you getting on?
-Oh, like a house on fire.

20:14.967 --> 20:18.221
Am I imagining things
or does father have
it in for our minister?

20:18.304 --> 20:23.059
Yes, he does rather.
He hasn't spoken to him
since Jamie's funeral.

20:23.142 --> 20:25.520
Now, about
the flowers for the wedding...

20:25.603 --> 20:29.607
The fuchsias are just coming
into bloom and they'll make
such a pretty bouquet.

20:29.691 --> 20:33.611
The thing is mother,
Pamela has asked for
orchids and lilies.

20:33.695 --> 20:36.364
Archie, I can't
possibly provide those.

20:36.447 --> 20:40.201
She's already spoken to
a florist in Edinburgh.

20:40.284 --> 20:44.163
-Oh. Oh, very well.
-There will still be
plenty for you to do.

20:44.247 --> 20:46.582
You and Pamela seem to have
everything under control.

20:46.666 --> 20:48.793
Why don't I just
leave you to it?

20:55.550 --> 21:00.763
Archie, I've just received
this fax from your friend,
Andrew McArdle.

21:00.847 --> 21:03.349
They had no
intention of listening to us.

21:03.433 --> 21:05.893
"Dear, Miss Finlay..."

21:05.977 --> 21:09.439
"We regret to confirm
that the closure will
go ahead as planned."

21:09.522 --> 21:12.567
I'm so sorry. What can I do?

21:12.650 --> 21:15.278
You could ask
everyone in the house
to join the campaign.

21:15.361 --> 21:17.405
I would if they
were speaking to me.

21:17.488 --> 21:19.782
-What's going on?
-You don't want to know.

21:19.866 --> 21:23.619
-Yeah, I do.
-How's Fergal these days?

21:23.703 --> 21:27.915
If I could find him, I'd tell
you. You can always rely on
a man to let you down.

21:32.211 --> 21:34.422
-All right, boss.
-Thank you.

21:36.674 --> 21:39.427
Treacle tarts.

21:39.510 --> 21:42.889
I'd buy them at
the supermarket
but it's a long walk.

21:42.972 --> 21:45.975
Me and your
mother got together
over one of those.

21:46.059 --> 21:48.478
I saw her sitting
out on the bridge,
looking down at the river.

21:48.561 --> 21:51.022
Some guy had dumped her.

21:51.105 --> 21:55.234
I took her out some treacle
tart and said, "This'll glue
a broken heart together."

21:55.318 --> 21:57.653
She laughed. We got
talking for the first time.

21:57.737 --> 21:59.489
Wasn't really
gonna jump, was she?

21:59.572 --> 22:04.243
Sometimes she's this scared
wee girl. Give her
another chance, Lexie.

22:04.327 --> 22:07.914
-Carrying a grudge
will wear you out.
-Oh.

22:07.997 --> 22:09.832
Should have known
I'd find you in here.

22:09.916 --> 22:12.043
Just picking up
some tips from the chef.

22:12.126 --> 22:14.962
Listen, I'll leave
you two girls to talk.

22:18.925 --> 22:23.096
-He's a lovely guy.
You're very lucky.
-He's the lucky one.

22:23.179 --> 22:27.308
I mean, finding someone
that really cares about you.
It's not easy.

22:27.392 --> 22:30.561
You would think that.
I've never had any
trouble finding men.

22:30.645 --> 22:33.856
No, it was just
keeping count that
was the hard part.

22:33.940 --> 22:36.943
Can I help it if men
find me attractive?

22:37.026 --> 22:39.862
-Like that cute wee laird?
-Archie?

22:39.946 --> 22:43.658
Just because he lives amongst
antiques doesn't mean he wants
to get off with one.

22:43.741 --> 22:47.995
Ooh! I suppose you're hoping
he'll stoke your Aga one day.

22:48.079 --> 22:50.748
Well, I don't
suppose it hurts to dream.

22:50.832 --> 22:54.752
-Ooh! Get off me with that!
-It's for your dress.

22:54.836 --> 22:57.922
-What dress?
-Your bridesmaid's dress.

22:58.006 --> 23:02.593
Ooh! Looks like you
take after your father.
Still, we'll save on material.

23:02.677 --> 23:06.139
If you think I'm
putting on some frock
for your tacky wee circus...

23:06.222 --> 23:08.307
Well, you're not
turning up like that...

23:08.391 --> 23:10.685
I'm not turning up at all.

23:10.768 --> 23:14.022
But I'll turn up at your
funeral in my dancing shoes!
How's that, eh?

23:14.105 --> 23:15.648
Lexie...

23:15.732 --> 23:16.983
I'm sorry,
she really seems...

23:17.066 --> 23:18.985
Like a spoiled
wee brat, I know.

23:19.068 --> 23:21.320
I suppose I should
blame her mother.

23:21.404 --> 23:26.117
The thing is, Archie, I've set
my heart on her coming to
the wedding and...

23:26.200 --> 23:30.663
See, if she doesn't, well...
I might just have to call the
whole thing off. I'm sorry.

23:30.747 --> 23:35.752
I'll talk to her,
Pamela, I promise.
Don't do anything hasty.

23:45.345 --> 23:46.763
(KNOCKING)

23:53.603 --> 23:55.521
Don't tell me.

23:55.605 --> 23:59.108
She's got her heart set
on me coming to the wedding.

23:59.192 --> 24:03.780
No talent for music, my
mother, but she can play any
man like a ukulele.

24:03.863 --> 24:08.117
Lexie, Pamela's making a real
effort. Why don't you just
give her a break?

24:08.201 --> 24:13.873
Okay, so she winds you up.
Father does it to me,
I know how you feel.

24:13.956 --> 24:17.919
My dad walked out when
I was five years old.

24:18.002 --> 24:21.964
Ever since then
my mother's brought home
everything in trousers.

24:22.048 --> 24:23.966
I didn't have a home.

24:24.050 --> 24:28.388
I grew up in a flophouse
pretending to be 30 while she
pretended she was 17.

24:28.471 --> 24:30.932
You sure you
know how that feels?

24:38.648 --> 24:42.568
Then one day
this creep she'd brought
home made a pass at me.

24:43.945 --> 24:45.488
I told her.

24:47.031 --> 24:50.118
She believed him.

24:50.201 --> 24:53.871
Some guy she'd just met.

24:53.955 --> 24:56.874
Said it was my
"wishful thinking".

24:59.544 --> 25:01.462
I had to leave.

25:02.922 --> 25:05.675
Fifteen and
living on the streets.

25:05.758 --> 25:08.177
Staying in
bedsits and hostels.

25:11.889 --> 25:15.101
Then one day I
fetched upon Glenbogle.

25:16.894 --> 25:19.272
And your mother took me in.

25:22.859 --> 25:26.070
This is the nearest thing
to a home I've ever had.

25:28.740 --> 25:31.034
Do you really know
how that feels, Archie?

25:37.081 --> 25:39.542
I'm not going to the wedding.

25:40.585 --> 25:42.253
I'd rather leave.

25:58.227 --> 26:00.730
What's
the punishment for truancy?

26:02.231 --> 26:04.650
-Expulsion.
-Katrina...

26:04.734 --> 26:08.279
But seeing as we're all going
to be expelled anyway,
it hardly matters, does it?

26:08.363 --> 26:11.741
Would it have
made any difference
if I'd been here?

26:11.824 --> 26:14.494
It would have made
a difference to me.

26:15.661 --> 26:18.164
I had to go to Edinburgh.

26:18.247 --> 26:21.709
Some friends are
setting up a wildlife park
in New Zealand.

26:21.793 --> 26:24.379
4,000 square
miles of virgin forest

26:25.463 --> 26:27.757
and they need a ranger.

26:27.840 --> 26:29.926
Who did you suggest?

26:30.009 --> 26:33.137
The best man for the job.

26:33.221 --> 26:34.931
Me.

26:36.891 --> 26:40.436
I know, New Zealand
isn't exactly
handy for commuting.

26:44.273 --> 26:49.404
-Well, what about Glenbogle?
-My work here is finished.
Duncan can manage.

26:50.655 --> 26:52.782
Right.

26:52.865 --> 26:55.410
Well,
at least one of us has a job.

26:57.203 --> 27:03.001
I've never been good
at sticking in
one place, Katrina.

27:03.084 --> 27:06.129
Never had much
reason to till I met you.

27:06.212 --> 27:08.840
I haven't accepted the job yet

27:08.923 --> 27:11.676
and I'm not going to
unless you come, too.

27:15.555 --> 27:17.223
Me?

27:21.227 --> 27:22.395
(KNOCKING)

27:25.732 --> 27:28.568
-Arch, good to see you.
-Thanks, Haz.

27:28.651 --> 27:31.029
So, what are you doing
in this neck of the woods?

27:31.112 --> 27:34.282
I was wondering if
you had time for a pint?

27:34.365 --> 27:37.452
-I'm not sure...
-If you're busy, then...

27:37.535 --> 27:40.663
Oh, don't be daft.
I'm a civil servant.
I'll just finish off here.

27:40.747 --> 27:43.166
What are you doing,
closing down
another primary school?

27:43.249 --> 27:47.587
Sorry, Archie, but you know
how it is, the relentless
quest for efficiency.

27:47.670 --> 27:51.924
We are right on the edge
of the catchment area.
You must have some discretion.

27:52.008 --> 27:56.929
I'd love to, Arch, but Lizzie
wants rationalisation and
that's what she's gonna get.

27:57.013 --> 27:58.264
Lizzie?

27:58.348 --> 28:02.727
Sorry. Elizabeth Renshaw,
Minister for Education.

28:02.810 --> 28:05.188
My boss.

28:05.271 --> 28:08.775
Okay, so, what about
sponsorship? You postpone
closing the school

28:08.858 --> 28:12.195
while we try to
find local businesses
who want to help with funding.

28:12.278 --> 28:15.823
Interesting. Show me some
figures, we'll review
the situation next year.

28:15.907 --> 28:18.701
Come on, Jack, once the school
is closed, that is it!

28:18.785 --> 28:23.623
Ten out of ten for effort,
Arch, but, I'm sorry,
the decision's been made.

28:23.706 --> 28:25.541
Well, I had to ask.

28:29.420 --> 28:31.464
Oh, look.
Isn't that you with...

28:31.547 --> 28:36.803
The First Minister? Yes.
At a private dinner for
high flyers, so-called.

28:36.886 --> 28:38.638
And there you are
getting a medal.

28:38.721 --> 28:43.142
For excellence in
media relations.
Silly really, but...

28:48.022 --> 28:51.317
"Andrew McArdle,
MA Hons, Oxford."

28:52.527 --> 28:54.987
So they changed
their minds, then?

28:55.071 --> 28:57.156
-Who?
-Oxford.

28:57.240 --> 28:59.951
I distinctly remember
you failed the entrance exam.

29:00.034 --> 29:03.830
Yes, yes, but I...
I retook it.

29:03.913 --> 29:07.917
Mmm...no, you didn't.
You never went to university.

29:08.001 --> 29:11.963
Well, there's nothing wrong
with a little poetic
licence on the old CV.

29:12.046 --> 29:16.467
I suppose not, unless you use
it to land a cushy job
with the civil service.

29:19.012 --> 29:21.681
Oh, dear... Jackanory.

29:27.812 --> 29:30.398
ARCHIE: What are those?

29:30.481 --> 29:32.442
New flyers for the campaign.

29:32.525 --> 29:35.653
Ah! Wish I'd caught you
sooner. I could have
saved you the trouble.

29:35.737 --> 29:39.115
-Oh?
-The good news is the school
will be staying open.

29:39.198 --> 29:43.411
The bad news is the older kids
will still have to
go to Glenmoriston,

29:43.494 --> 29:47.749
so the school will
only need one teacher.

29:47.832 --> 29:51.586
-You've been pulling strings,
haven't you?
-Something like that.

29:51.669 --> 29:56.132
That's fantastic. I wish there
was something I could
do to repay you.

29:56.215 --> 30:00.136
You could take over Glenbogle
while I go on
holiday for a year or two.

30:00.219 --> 30:03.181
-Are you gonna tell
me what's wrong now?
-Oh, not much.

30:03.264 --> 30:07.143
Golly's got the hump,
Father's insulted the
minister, Lexie's matricidal,

30:07.226 --> 30:10.730
everyone seems determined
to knacker this project
before it's even started.

30:10.813 --> 30:12.815
The grand wedding project.

30:12.899 --> 30:17.403
No one seems to care that I am
trying to turn Glenbogle into
a successful venue.

30:17.487 --> 30:22.617
But it's not a venue, it's
your home. I know you're
trying to turn a profit.

30:22.700 --> 30:26.371
But what's the point
if it's making
everyone miserable?

30:26.454 --> 30:29.707
You know,
you are really
irritating when you're right.

30:32.001 --> 30:36.089
So, when are you
gonna tell Maureen
that her job's going?

30:36.172 --> 30:39.884
I don't know. I'll have
to wait for the right time.

30:39.967 --> 30:43.971
Well, good luck. In my
experience, there isn't one.

30:53.523 --> 30:55.149
(CAR APPROACHING)

31:00.697 --> 31:02.031
Oh. Hi.

31:02.115 --> 31:03.491
(HECTOR GRUNTING)

31:23.052 --> 31:26.723
Can you tell me why you think
the Reverend Mitchell
is such a pompous windbag

31:26.806 --> 31:29.809
when you never
even go to church?

31:29.892 --> 31:33.604
I heard him once.
Didn't think much of him.

31:33.688 --> 31:36.774
-At Jamie's funeral.
-Was it? I don't remember.

31:38.860 --> 31:40.278
That's what Mother told me.

31:43.990 --> 31:49.454
I remember him talking about
God's special purpose,
how we mustn't question it.

31:49.537 --> 31:53.374
How pain told you you were
alive and that Jamie was
in a better place.

31:55.126 --> 31:57.503
My son was lying
there in a coffin

31:57.587 --> 32:01.299
and that arrogant
halfwit was telling me
it was all for the best.

32:01.382 --> 32:03.634
I'm sorry, I had no idea.

32:03.718 --> 32:06.721
Why should you? You were
only a boy at the time.

32:08.890 --> 32:10.433
I do remember that day.

32:12.185 --> 32:15.438
Silence everywhere.

32:15.521 --> 32:18.483
Mother trying to smile
but her eyes were so red.

32:22.528 --> 32:25.448
Jamie should have
been running this place.

32:25.531 --> 32:30.036
He could have organised
a wedding without putting
everyone's backs up.

32:30.119 --> 32:34.415
You don't do too badly...
All things considered.

32:37.460 --> 32:39.504
You can't go.

32:39.587 --> 32:42.799
There's a job for you here
now that Archie's
saved the school.

32:42.882 --> 32:45.051
There's a job for somebody.

32:45.134 --> 32:47.887
I wouldn't have
to fire my deputy
if it weren't for Fergal.

32:47.970 --> 32:53.518
Katrina, you're part of this
place. Not just the school or
the village or the Big House.

32:53.601 --> 32:58.648
And Archie's a good manager.
He's stubborn. Headstrong.

32:58.731 --> 33:03.027
You're the only one that
can get through to him.
He needs you.

33:03.111 --> 33:07.907
-You wouldn't know it.
-He doesn't know it, lass.

33:07.990 --> 33:11.202
Now,
you ask him what he thinks
before you decide.

33:12.328 --> 33:14.997
-I want to, but...
-What? Are you scared?

33:16.082 --> 33:20.086
-I am not scared.
-Good.

33:20.169 --> 33:25.425
-So Archie's
stubborn and headstrong?
-Like a big kid sometimes.

33:25.508 --> 33:29.554
Would he go off and sulk
if he couldn't
play the bagpipes?

33:29.637 --> 33:33.391
That is about standing up
for our culture, Katrina.

33:33.474 --> 33:36.686
I thought it was about
some stranger's wedding.

33:36.769 --> 33:42.608
Archie's trying
to run a business.
He can't do it on his own.

33:42.692 --> 33:47.488
I think this orchestra idea is
daft. I think what we
need is a big band.

33:47.572 --> 33:50.950
Saxophones, white DJ's,
the whole
jang-bang shooting match.

33:51.034 --> 33:53.119
I'll talk to Lexie.

33:53.202 --> 33:55.663
Don't fret. She'll cheer up
when she sees that
designer frock I got her.

33:55.747 --> 33:58.207
I'm afraid she's not
gonna be your bridesmaid.

33:58.291 --> 34:02.754
-I thought she worked for you.
-I don't hire her
out for weddings.

34:02.837 --> 34:04.589
Oh, I see.

34:04.672 --> 34:08.134
She's been spinning you
one of her sad sob stories,
has she?

34:08.217 --> 34:10.719
Poor wee neglected Lexie.

34:10.803 --> 34:14.349
What about me?
Do you think it was fun
being a single mother?

34:14.431 --> 34:17.810
Look, whatever problems you
and Lexie have, I am sure you
can work them out.

34:17.893 --> 34:21.773
But making her your bridesmaid
perhaps isn't
the right place to start.

34:21.856 --> 34:25.693
We can still do your wedding,
though perhaps not on
the scale you'd imagined.

34:25.777 --> 34:27.695
What do you mean?

34:27.779 --> 34:32.408
Well, Glenbogle isn't really
the place for... big bands and
hot air balloons.

34:32.492 --> 34:34.702
Are you saying you
won't arrange them?

34:34.786 --> 34:38.039
I'm saying we can do something
really special and intimate.

34:38.121 --> 34:43.418
Oh! I don't want
"special and intimate".

34:43.503 --> 34:47.965
I want it the way I planned
it. I want the tent,
I want the lilies,

34:48.049 --> 34:52.844
and I want that backstabbing
wee madam oot here wearing
the dress that I paid for!

34:52.929 --> 34:57.558
But, no, she's far too
busy slagging me off!
And you believe her!

34:57.642 --> 35:01.354
This was supposed
to be my special day!

35:01.437 --> 35:06.484
And you two have ruined it!
I'm phoning my lawyer!

35:09.821 --> 35:14.409
And I never
wanted to get married
in this ugly slum anyway!

35:20.415 --> 35:22.291
Oh, super.

36:05.209 --> 36:08.254
Oh, you've...had
the place painted.

36:08.338 --> 36:11.174
-That was 10 years ago.
-Oh.

36:20.308 --> 36:23.478
Yes, Stuart liked it gloomy.
It suited him.

36:23.561 --> 36:26.564
-Stuart?
-Reverend James.
Chap you took over from.

36:26.647 --> 36:29.942
Man of few words.
Shortest sermons in Scotland.

36:31.611 --> 36:35.239
Not big on
the "religious twaddle", then?

36:35.323 --> 36:38.493
-No. Well...
-When I started out,

36:38.576 --> 36:43.873
I knew a minister's
duty was to offer comfort
so I used to talk a lot.

36:43.956 --> 36:50.546
The trouble is I knew nothing
except cliches from books.
I was that green.

36:50.630 --> 36:55.802
When I think of what I said
at your son's funeral, I want
to hang my head in shame.

36:57.720 --> 37:02.600
-I'm sorry,
I didn't realise...
-No, I'm sorry, Hector.

37:02.684 --> 37:05.520
I've been wanting to
apologise for years.

37:05.603 --> 37:08.064
I was just too embarrassed,
I suppose.

37:10.191 --> 37:12.318
I came to apologise to you.

37:19.075 --> 37:23.871
Take a seat. It's
a good place to be still.

37:23.955 --> 37:27.166
And I promise to say nothing.

37:44.767 --> 37:46.644
You never made up with Lexie?

37:46.728 --> 37:48.604
She's the one
making things up.

37:48.688 --> 37:51.065
I came here to
get married, Pamela.

37:51.149 --> 37:53.317
-Why do you think I came?
-To show off.

37:53.401 --> 37:55.653
To rub Lexie's nose
in your good fortune.

37:55.737 --> 37:58.531
You haven't
stopped needling her
since we arrived.

37:58.614 --> 38:01.325
Aye, well, it's her fault.
She brings oot
the worst in me.

38:01.409 --> 38:04.996
Why, because she
reminds you of your mistakes?

38:05.079 --> 38:07.081
I just don't want to get
married here, okay?

38:07.165 --> 38:09.500
So you cancelled it,
just like that?

38:09.584 --> 38:12.795
-Without even telling me?
-You can get married here
by yourself if you want.

38:12.879 --> 38:16.049
I don't want to
get married at all!

38:16.132 --> 38:18.426
You used to make
me laugh, you know.

38:18.509 --> 38:23.348
You used to make me feel
I was the luckiest man alive.
And now...

38:23.431 --> 38:27.143
I think if you
came into my cafe,
I'd turn you away.

38:27.226 --> 38:29.687
I wish I'd never
seen that money.

38:38.196 --> 38:40.948
If you're sticking
your head in there, Lex,
move over.

38:41.032 --> 38:43.201
No point. It isn't gas.

38:47.705 --> 38:50.375
I told Pamela you
won't be appearing.

38:52.001 --> 38:54.170
What did she say?

38:54.253 --> 38:56.047
She didn't say much.

38:56.130 --> 39:00.051
She screamed a lot.
About lawsuits and bankruptcy,
that sort of thing.

39:00.134 --> 39:02.553
-She wouldn't.
-Forget it.

39:02.637 --> 39:04.597
I'm not dragging you to the
altar in chains.

39:04.681 --> 39:07.308
I'd never find the shoes
to match, for one thing.

39:08.643 --> 39:09.977
I'm sorry, Arch.

39:10.061 --> 39:14.649
Oh, don't apologise.
We don't choose our parents.

39:14.732 --> 39:17.860
The worst thing is
what she does to you.

39:17.944 --> 39:22.115
You're normally so vivacious,
so exuberant. Sharp.

39:22.198 --> 39:25.535
As soon as Pamela
walks in, you shrivel up.

39:25.618 --> 39:29.789
-I know. It's just she...
-Well, it's only
because you let her.

39:29.872 --> 39:32.667
-Don't you see how
much she envies you?
-Me?

39:32.750 --> 39:34.669
Yes, you.

39:34.752 --> 39:40.008
She envies your independence,
your self-reliance,
your self-assurance.

39:40.091 --> 39:43.928
-And your looks.
-Stop it, Arch.

39:44.012 --> 39:46.556
-Okay.
-No, go on.

39:46.639 --> 39:49.976
I mean it, Lexie,
you are everything
that she wants to be.

39:50.059 --> 39:53.646
I know you had a terrible
childhood and I can't begin
to imagine it, but...

39:53.730 --> 39:57.859
You're you, in spite of
all your disadvantages.

39:57.942 --> 40:02.030
And that just
makes you more amazing.

40:02.113 --> 40:08.161
Thanks, Arch. You're a very
sweet man. In spite of all
your...advantages.

40:09.412 --> 40:12.415
Come on.

40:12.498 --> 40:17.670
Now, no more talk about
leaving Glenbogle, okay?
You are wanted here.

40:17.754 --> 40:20.882
What for? You're
a better cook than I am.

40:20.965 --> 40:23.593
For your Lexie-ness.

40:23.676 --> 40:26.095
-Wanted by whom?
-By everyone.

40:26.679 --> 40:28.181
Including you?

40:29.640 --> 40:31.142
Especially me.

40:42.153 --> 40:44.864
Katrina, hi. We were just...

40:44.947 --> 40:47.950
Yeah, I could see.
I shouldn't have...

40:48.034 --> 40:50.787
(STAMMERING) Who
are you looking for?

40:50.870 --> 40:52.455
It doesn't matter.

40:55.667 --> 40:57.085
Timing, eh?

40:58.795 --> 41:01.047
Where are you going?

41:01.130 --> 41:04.550
-I'm just gonna
help my mum pack.
-Do you want a hand?

41:04.634 --> 41:07.595
No. I'm just gonna
chuck her
clothes out the window.

41:16.396 --> 41:19.482
It's only me. You can
turn off the waterworks.

41:19.565 --> 41:21.109
Leave me alone.

41:21.901 --> 41:23.319
What's up?

41:25.238 --> 41:29.659
He's gone. Run off.
Just like the rest of them.

41:29.742 --> 41:31.035
Eric?

41:32.829 --> 41:34.747
Well...

41:34.831 --> 41:41.170
Like you say, men are like
buses. Nothing for ages then
three arrive at once.

41:41.254 --> 41:46.300
Aye, well,
the bus service around here
ain't what it used to be, eh?

41:46.384 --> 41:50.263
So, what?
You have money for taxis.

41:50.346 --> 41:54.017
It's not about the money.
That's not why I
was marrying him.

41:54.100 --> 41:57.562
-Yeah, right!
-Think the worst. Go ahead.

41:59.147 --> 42:02.316
But he was
always so good to me.

42:03.484 --> 42:06.738
Never judged me
and...he was always...

42:07.905 --> 42:10.158
there.

42:10.241 --> 42:12.785
Until you drove him off.

42:12.869 --> 42:17.874
It's never your fault, is it?
Everyone always
dumps on poor wee Pamela.

42:17.957 --> 42:21.085
-Aye, including my family.
-Oh, come on!

42:21.169 --> 42:23.254
You didn't expect me
to run into
your arms, did you?

42:23.338 --> 42:26.966
You must have known what would
happen. It happens to
you all the time!

42:27.050 --> 42:29.218
And what would you know?

42:29.302 --> 42:33.181
I mean, look at you, with your
pert wee face and your lovely
skin and your perfect body,

42:33.264 --> 42:36.517
living in a beautiful house
surrounded by
people who love you!

42:36.601 --> 42:38.978
What do you know
about anything?

42:44.108 --> 42:45.526
Well...

42:47.403 --> 42:49.697
-Jealousy...
-...gets you nowhere.

42:55.161 --> 43:00.375
Look, you didn't love him.
So just dry your
eyes and move on.

43:00.458 --> 43:02.168
I did love him.

43:03.211 --> 43:04.420
I do.

43:07.715 --> 43:09.425
You really do, don't you?

43:31.656 --> 43:34.951
-Do you need some help there?
-Are you taking the Hamish?

43:35.034 --> 43:39.622
These are bagpipes, okay?
If you don't like them,
you can cover your ears.

43:39.706 --> 43:42.709
-Henderson's, 1930s?
-What?

43:42.792 --> 43:45.294
I used to skirl a bit myself,
when I was in the army.

43:45.378 --> 43:48.631
-Thought you hated them.
-That was Pamela, not me.

43:48.715 --> 43:50.299
You let a woman
forbid you the pipes?

43:50.383 --> 43:53.803
Hand them over. There's
life in the old fingers yet.

44:04.105 --> 44:08.192
Wouldn't it be more humane
just to kill it outright?

44:08.276 --> 44:09.861
What are you doing here?

44:11.154 --> 44:13.906
I brought you something.

44:20.496 --> 44:24.584
-Treacle tart.
-That'll glue
together a broken heart.

44:24.667 --> 44:27.378
Right, well...
We'll leave you to it.

45:01.329 --> 45:04.290
Jimmy said he'd have
a crate of pink
champagne here by midday.

45:04.374 --> 45:05.917
I'll believe
that when I see it.

45:06.000 --> 45:07.543
Oh, put that down
by the loch

45:07.627 --> 45:10.088
and then could you
move the trellis from
the flower garden?

45:10.171 --> 45:11.589
What's going on?

45:11.673 --> 45:13.508
Oh, didn't anyone tell you
there's going to be a wedding?

45:13.591 --> 45:15.051
Today?

45:15.134 --> 45:18.846
I think you're
giving away the bride,
but not in that jumper.

45:18.930 --> 45:20.431
Who's gonna officiate?

45:20.515 --> 45:22.892
Reverend Mitchell
said he can come
over anytime we like.

45:22.975 --> 45:26.437
I suggested 10.30 so we can
have a quick run-through.
Morning, Archie.

45:27.855 --> 45:29.023
Did I miss something?

45:29.107 --> 45:31.901
I know you were planning
a grand ceremony, dear,

45:31.984 --> 45:35.738
but Pamela asked for something
a little more intimate.

45:35.822 --> 45:37.073
Intimate?

45:39.075 --> 45:41.327
Marvellous.
Absolutely marvellous.

45:41.411 --> 45:43.913
No, Hector. Dreadful.

45:43.996 --> 45:46.666
No sense of style, that woman.

45:46.749 --> 45:50.837
-Oh,
what about ivy for fidelity?
-Oh, yes, please.

45:52.880 --> 45:54.841
And which tie
would sir prefer?

45:54.924 --> 45:58.845
-They're all lovely.
-It's customary just
to wear one, I'm afraid.

45:58.928 --> 46:01.347
Archie, the minister's here.

46:07.812 --> 46:10.398
How do I look?

46:10.481 --> 46:13.484
-Like a gorilla in a kilt.
-Thank you.

46:15.695 --> 46:17.530
A sexy gorilla.

46:26.581 --> 46:28.499
(DUNCAN CLEARS THROAT)

47:11.793 --> 47:17.006
I therefore declare you
to be husband and wife.

47:17.090 --> 47:18.758
You may kiss the bride.

47:20.510 --> 47:21.969
HECTOR: Bravo!

47:31.646 --> 47:34.941
I forgot to
say...you look lovely.

47:35.024 --> 47:38.027
And I forgot to say,
so do you.

47:43.324 --> 47:45.368
Just a little something.

47:46.786 --> 47:48.830
Oh, Eric,
please, this is far too much.

47:48.913 --> 47:53.167
Listen, son,
what you've given us today,
money can't buy. Thank you.

47:54.711 --> 47:56.337
Thank you.

47:57.171 --> 47:59.549
-Archie...
-Hi.

47:59.632 --> 48:01.259
Hi.

48:01.342 --> 48:06.097
-That was beautiful.
-Yeah, it was...
It was very moving.

48:12.478 --> 48:14.063
What?

48:14.147 --> 48:16.107
I'm...

48:16.190 --> 48:21.237
I'm giving in my notice.
I've been offered
another job, in New Zealand.

48:21.320 --> 48:25.283
New Zealand?
You haven't been that
miserable here, have you?

48:25.366 --> 48:30.413
Quite the opposite.
I've done all I can here.
It's time to move on now.

48:31.914 --> 48:36.044
Right, yeah. Well,
you've done a fabulous job.
Thank you.

48:36.127 --> 48:37.628
I'm going with him.

48:38.671 --> 48:41.132
Eh?

48:41.215 --> 48:44.677
Maureen's going to take over
as head teacher at the school.

48:44.761 --> 48:49.891
All this closure business
has just made me
rethink my options.

48:49.974 --> 48:54.687
I want to see
a bit more of the world
before I hand in my bus pass.

48:58.358 --> 48:59.650
Right.

49:00.818 --> 49:02.612
Yes, yes, of course.

49:04.781 --> 49:06.741
Well, you'll be missed.

49:10.119 --> 49:12.580
I'll see you
before you go, yeah?

49:26.719 --> 49:29.764
-Can you give me a minute?
-Yeah, sure.

49:34.268 --> 49:38.690
Look after Archie for me,
okay? I hope you two will
be very happy together.

49:40.983 --> 49:44.946
There is no "us two".
Not the way you mean.

49:46.280 --> 49:49.867
What you saw
the other day, it was just...

49:49.951 --> 49:54.163
we were both a bit lost,
needed a bit of reassurance,
that's all.

49:56.332 --> 49:59.335
Not that I wouldn't
mind it if we did.

49:59.419 --> 50:00.920
Someday.

50:02.130 --> 50:04.924
But maybe after you've gone.

50:05.008 --> 50:07.593
I'm not catching
him on the rebound.

50:09.345 --> 50:12.056
Good luck to you, too, okay?

50:17.353 --> 50:19.022
See you.
