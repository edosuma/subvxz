HEY, LEAVE THAT BLINDFOLD ALONE.

08:46.692 --> 08:48.444
YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED
TO TAKE IT OFF.

08:48.527 --> 08:48.861
IT SPOILS THE FUN.

08:48.945 --> 08:50.613
- FINE.

08:53.366 --> 08:56.077

WE ARE PRETTY MUCH THERE.

I'M KIND OF GLAD.

09:04.669 --> 09:06.712
I'VE BEEN MEANING
TO TALK TO YOU,

09:06.796 --> 09:09.548
BUT THE HOUSE
HAS JUST BEEN SO BUSY.

09:09.632 --> 09:11.676

BUT I NEED YOU TO KNOW.

09:16.055 --> 09:19.558
I THINK YOU'RE
PRETTY AWESOME, PATRICIA.

09:19.642 --> 09:22.270
- STEADY, EDDIE.

09:22.353 --> 09:25.982
I GET KIND OF GOOFY AROUND YOU.

09:26.065 --> 09:27.942
AND I WAS GLAD THAT
YOU WERE JEALOUS OF MARA

09:28.025 --> 09:31.153
BECAUSE IT MEANS
YOU LIKE ME TOO.

09:31.237 --> 09:34.782

- I'M RIGHT HERE
NEXT TO YOU, DOOFUS.

10:22.121 --> 10:23.414
- UH, IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE,
LIKE, A MILE AWAY.

10:23.497 --> 10:26.375
- I'M ACTUALLY LONG-SIGHTED,

10:26.459 --> 10:28.210
AND I'M PRETTY SENSITIVE
ABOUT IT,

10:28.294 --> 10:31.547
SO IF YOU COULD NOT
GO ON ABOUT IT, OKAY?

10:31.630 --> 10:32.381
OKAY, CAN YOU MOVE IT
A LITTLE BIT TO THE LEFT

10:32.465 --> 10:34.759
AND A LITTLE BIT UP?

10:34.842 --> 10:39.722
I JUST WANT TO LOOK PRETTY
FOR OUR DATE.

10:39.805 --> 10:42.641
THAT'S IT!
DON'T MOVE A MUSCLE.

10:42.725 --> 10:43.684
- OKAY.

10:43.768 --> 10:46.187
YOU FIND MAKEUP
PRETTY EXCITING, HUH?

10:46.270 --> 10:49.315
[magical whooshing]

10:50.191 --> 10:53.486
[stone scraping]

10:53.569 --> 10:54.528
WHAT WAS THAT?

10:54.612 --> 10:57.615
- MY, UM--UM, MY, UM--

10:57.698 --> 10:58.699
MY SHOE.

10:58.783 --> 11:00.368
I'VE GOT CHEWING GUM
ON MY SHOE,

11:00.451 --> 11:03.079
AND I WAS JUST GETTING IT OFF.

11:03.162 --> 11:04.497
- WHAT, ARE YOU WEARING
STONE SHOES?

11:04.580 --> 11:05.873
[all chuckle quietly]

11:05.956 --> 11:07.750
PATRICIA,
THAT WAS A LITTLE FREAKY.

11:07.833 --> 11:10.086
ARE YOU SURE WE'RE
THE ONLY ONES DOWN HERE?

11:10.169 --> 11:11.921
- OF COURSE!

11:12.004 --> 11:14.215
I SAID BLIND DATE!

11:16.926 --> 11:21.097
[magical whooshing]

11:21.180 --> 11:21.764
EDDIE!

11:21.847 --> 11:23.182
[electricity buzzes]

11:27.686 --> 11:29.647
- EDDIE!

11:29.730 --> 11:31.941
[electricity buzzing]

11:32.024 --> 11:32.942
- HEY!

11:33.025 --> 11:35.027
- YOU WERE ABOUT
TO LOSE YOUR HEAD!

11:35.111 --> 11:38.114
I-I MEAN BANG YOUR HEAD.

11:38.197 --> 11:39.949
LOW CEILINGS.

11:40.032 --> 11:43.119
- THANKS, I GUESS?

11:43.202 --> 11:45.204
WELL, THIS IS COZY.

11:45.287 --> 11:48.749
- NO, YOU CAN'T
TAKE THAT OFF YET.

11:48.833 --> 11:49.250
I'M NOT READY.

11:49.333 --> 11:51.460
I'M...

11:51.544 --> 11:52.795
FLOSSING.

11:52.878 --> 11:54.964
ANYWAY, THERE'S SOMEWHERE ELSE
I NEED TO TAKE YOU,

11:55.047 --> 11:58.342
SO LET'S GO.

11:58.426 --> 11:59.385
WATCH OUT.
LOW CEILINGS.

11:59.468 --> 12:01.721
- RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT.

12:01.804 --> 12:04.098
YOU'RE ACTING
WEIRDER THAN NORMAL.

12:04.181 --> 12:05.349
YOU KNOW THAT, RIGHT?

12:14.275 --> 12:17.194
- JUST GO
A LITTLE BIT MORE FORWARD.

12:17.278 --> 12:18.154
- OKAY.

12:18.237 --> 12:19.405
[door creaks]

12:19.488 --> 12:22.283
- OKAY, STAND STILL.

12:26.412 --> 12:28.831
- OKAY, BACK WHERE WE STARTED.

12:28.914 --> 12:29.832
- IT WAS A TRUST EXERCISE.

12:29.915 --> 12:32.042
AND CONGRATULATIONS,
YOU PASSED.

12:32.126 --> 12:33.961
- GOOD.

12:34.044 --> 12:35.296
WELL, WHAT'S MY REWARD?

12:35.379 --> 12:37.548
- THIS...

12:37.631 --> 12:41.760
AND THIS.

12:41.844 --> 12:43.345
- THANK GOODNESS YOU FLOSSED.

12:50.936 --> 12:52.563
- WHOA.

12:57.776 --> 13:01.363
SO THIS IS
THE CHAMBER OF THE MASK?

13:01.447 --> 13:02.156
AND THE MASK IS...

13:02.239 --> 13:04.825
- NOT HERE.
- NO!

13:04.909 --> 13:07.119
- WELL, MAYBE THERE'S
ANOTHER DOOR.

13:07.203 --> 13:08.871
- NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
- WAIT, NO.

13:08.954 --> 13:10.080
WE DON'T WANT TO RUSH IN.

13:10.164 --> 13:11.832
IT MIGHT BE A TRAP.

13:11.916 --> 13:13.709
- WAIT.

13:13.792 --> 13:14.585
I THINK THIS IS A GAME.

13:14.668 --> 13:17.463
I'VE SEEN THIS BOARD BEFORE.

13:17.546 --> 13:19.757
WE NEED TO LOOK IT UP.
LET'S GO.

13:19.840 --> 13:20.883
WE CAN DO THIS.

13:29.683 --> 13:31.560
- JOY, YOU KNOW
THIS ARTICLE YOU WROTE

13:31.644 --> 13:33.354
ON FATHERS AND SONS?

13:33.437 --> 13:37.024
- WHAT ABOUT IT?

13:37.107 --> 13:41.153
- "THE RESENTFUL SON
AND THE GUILTY FATHER."

13:41.237 --> 13:43.822
NOW, THAT ALL SOUNDS
KIND OF FAMILIAR.

13:43.906 --> 13:44.740
- DOES IT?

13:44.823 --> 13:46.617
[sighs]
I MEAN, POSSIBLY, YEAH.

13:46.700 --> 13:47.660
I JUST--

13:47.743 --> 13:51.455
- BASICALLY MY LIFE
IN YOUR WORDS.

13:51.539 --> 13:56.252
HOW COULD YOU POSSIBLY KNOW
THAT MY DAD IS IN PRISON?

13:56.335 --> 13:58.045
UNLESS...

13:58.128 --> 13:59.463
- UNLESS WHAT?

13:59.547 --> 14:02.424
- UNLESS MARA TOLD YOU.

14:02.508 --> 14:04.927
- YEAH, MARA TOLD ME.

14:05.010 --> 14:08.013
BUT DON'T SAY ANYTHING,
WILL YOU?

14:08.097 --> 14:09.765
- DON'T WORRY, JOY.

14:09.848 --> 14:11.809
"DISCRETION" IS MY MIDDLE NAME.

14:25.155 --> 14:26.448
- ALL RIGHT, LET'S SEE
WHAT THOSE BRATS MEANT

14:26.532 --> 14:31.120
BY "SECRET PASSAGEWAY."

14:31.203 --> 14:34.957
- VERA.

14:35.040 --> 14:38.335
IT HAS BEEN DAYS
WITHOUT A WORD.

14:38.419 --> 14:43.090
NOTHING!

14:43.173 --> 14:46.051
NOTHING CAN BE AS IMPORTANT
AS THIS RITUAL.

14:46.135 --> 14:47.261
- THE MASK!

14:47.344 --> 14:49.054
- THE MASK IS BEYOND
YOUR COMPREHENSION.

14:49.138 --> 14:53.642
THE PERSON WHO WEARS IT
WILL PASS THROUGH THE TRIALS

14:53.726 --> 14:54.935
OF THE EGYPTIAN AFTERLIFE

14:55.019 --> 15:00.983
AND TAKE HIS PLACE
AMONG THE PHARAOHS OF OLD.

15:01.066 --> 15:06.572
AS A GOD,
I'M OFFERING YOU IMMORTALITY,

15:06.655 --> 15:10.284
RICHES BEYOND YOUR DREAMS,

15:10.367 --> 15:14.413
THE POWER OF ANUBIS HIMSELF.

15:14.496 --> 15:20.210
- I WAS LOOKING FOR AWARDS
IN THIS LIFE, RUFUS.

15:20.294 --> 15:22.963
- YOUR AMBITIONS ARE SO LIMITED.

15:23.047 --> 15:27.217
YOU COULD HAVE HAD THE WORLD
AS YOUR SERVANT.

15:27.301 --> 15:30.179
VERY WELL.

15:30.262 --> 15:31.513
I WILL GO ALONE.

15:31.597 --> 15:33.599
I AM AKH.

15:33.682 --> 15:37.102
I GO TO THE SETHET ANU.

15:37.186 --> 15:38.562
I AM AKH.

15:38.646 --> 15:42.232
I GO TO THE SETHET ANU.

15:42.316 --> 15:45.027
I GO
TO THE SETHET ANU!

15:45.110 --> 15:47.279
I GO TO THE SETHET ANU!

15:50.532 --> 15:52.576
- YOU DON'T SEEM TO BE GOING.

15:58.832 --> 16:00.959
- THAT'S BECAUSE IT'S A FAKE.
YOU'VE BEEN TRICKED.

16:01.043 --> 16:02.419
[metal clangs]

16:16.308 --> 16:19.561
NOW, YOU GET ME THE REAL MASK,

16:19.645 --> 16:22.690
OR I WILL MAKE SURE THAT YOU DO
GO TO THE AFTERLIFE...

16:25.609 --> 16:27.152
THE OLD-FASHIONED WAY.

16:32.157 --> 16:35.160
- [sighs]

16:37.329 --> 16:38.414
- HEY.

16:38.497 --> 16:41.750
HAVE YOU HEARD FROM YOUR DAD
SINCE OUR VISIT?

16:41.834 --> 16:45.879
- I'M NOT SURE I'D TELL YOU
EVEN IF I HAD.

16:45.963 --> 16:48.424
WHY DID YOU TELL JOY
ALL MY PERSONAL STUFF, MARA?

16:48.507 --> 16:50.092
- I-I DIDN'T.

16:50.175 --> 16:52.386
- I THOUGHT YOU WERE
BEING A FRIEND,

16:52.469 --> 16:56.432
BUT THE WHOLE TIME,
YOU WERE CLEARLY TAKING NOTES.

16:56.515 --> 16:58.475
- I PROMISE I DIDN'T
TELL JOY ANYTHING.

16:58.559 --> 17:03.188
- THEN HOW COULD SHE
HAVE WRITTEN IT?

17:03.272 --> 17:04.732
SHE DIDN'T WRITE IT, DID SHE?

17:04.815 --> 17:07.818
YOU'RE JACK JACKAL.

17:07.901 --> 17:09.737
- IT'S A LONG STORY.

17:09.819 --> 17:10.945
- WELL, WAIT A MINUTE.

17:11.029 --> 17:12.781
IF YOU'RE JACK,
THEN NINA-GATE, THAT WAS YOU?

17:12.865 --> 17:15.617
- NO, THAT WAS JOY.

17:15.701 --> 17:18.287
I TOLD YOU IT WAS A LONG STORY.

17:18.369 --> 17:20.164
- I'M LISTENING.

17:20.247 --> 17:22.875
- AW, WHO'D HAVE THOUGHT
YOU AND YOUR DAD

17:22.958 --> 17:24.542
HAD SO MUCH IN COMMON?

17:24.626 --> 17:25.627
- JACK JACKAL, RIGHT?

17:25.711 --> 17:26.712
- YEAH.

17:26.795 --> 17:28.630
- ARE YOU SURE
YOU DIDN'T TELL JOY

17:28.714 --> 17:29.673
ANY OF THAT STUFF?

17:29.757 --> 17:31.967
- QUIT WITH THE ACCUSATIONS.

17:32.050 --> 17:33.677
I THOUGHT WE TRUSTED
EACH OTHER NOW.

17:33.761 --> 17:35.763
- RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT.

17:35.846 --> 17:38.182
MUST HAVE BEEN MARA THEN.

17:38.265 --> 17:40.017
- YOU'VE TOLD MARA
PERSONAL STUFF

17:40.100 --> 17:41.852
ABOUT YOU AND YOUR DAD?

17:41.935 --> 17:43.228
- WELL, WE HAD TIME TO KILL

17:43.312 --> 17:46.064
WHEN WE WERE IN THE CELLAR
STAKING OUT FOR GHOSTS.

17:46.148 --> 17:48.901
- EDDIE, CAN I HAVE
A WORD, PLEASE?

17:48.984 --> 17:50.235
IN PRIVATE.

17:50.319 --> 17:51.153
- RUDE.

17:51.236 --> 17:53.030
- SORRY, PATRICIA.
BOY TALK.

17:53.113 --> 17:54.782
CARS, FOOTBALL.

17:54.865 --> 17:56.533
- WELL, YOU CAN'T DRIVE.

17:56.617 --> 17:58.660
AND HE THINKS YOU PLAY FOOTBALL
IN TIGHTS AND A HELMET.

17:58.744 --> 18:03.749
SO ENJOY.

18:03.832 --> 18:05.167
- SHOOT.

18:05.250 --> 18:06.335
- WHAT IF I WERE TO TELL YOU

18:06.418 --> 18:08.837
THAT JOY DIDN'T WRITE
THAT ARTICLE

18:08.921 --> 18:12.007
ABOUT YOU, ME,
AND OUR DYSFUNCTIONAL DADS?

18:12.090 --> 18:13.592
- [scoffs]

18:16.095 --> 18:17.679
- WE NEED TO CONTINUE
IN THIS QUEST, VICTOR,

18:17.763 --> 18:19.014
IF WE ARE TO HAVE
ANY KIND OF FUTURE.

18:19.097 --> 18:20.015
WE NEED THAT MASK.

18:20.098 --> 18:21.683
- YOU APPEAR TO BE FORGETTING

18:21.767 --> 18:23.685
THAT I NO LONGER HAVE AN AMULET,

18:23.769 --> 18:24.728
AND WHAT ABOUT THIS?

18:24.812 --> 18:25.771
- IT WAS JUST A DREAM.

18:25.854 --> 18:28.982
- YOU ARE NOT
REMEMBERING CLEARLY.

18:29.066 --> 18:31.318
YOU WERE FROZEN, INCAPACITATED.

18:31.401 --> 18:32.945
- I CAN REMEMBER
MORE THAN YOU THINK.

18:33.028 --> 18:34.196
IT'S BEEN COMING
BACK TO ME SLOWLY,

18:34.279 --> 18:35.405
AND I'M SURE
I HEARD THE KIDS

18:35.489 --> 18:36.198
TALKING ABOUT
A SECRET PASSAGEWAY

18:36.281 --> 18:38.033
FROM THE LIBRARY TO THE TUNNELS.

18:38.116 --> 18:39.034
- REALLY?

18:39.117 --> 18:40.369
- WE DON'T NEED AMULETS

18:40.452 --> 18:42.246
IF WE CAN ENTER THE TUNNEL
SYSTEM HALFWAY THROUGH.

18:42.329 --> 18:43.580
- YES, BUT THIS SPIRIT,
SENKHARA,

18:43.664 --> 18:45.499
SHE APPEARS TO BE ON THE SIDE
OF THE CHILDREN.

18:45.582 --> 18:46.625
- ARE YOU AFRAID, VICTOR?

18:46.708 --> 18:47.876
IF I'M PREPARED
TO TAKE THE RISK,

18:47.960 --> 18:48.919
WHY AREN'T YOU?

18:49.002 --> 18:50.045
- [clears throat]

18:50.128 --> 18:53.006
I AM AFRAID
ONLY FOR YOUR SAFETY!

18:53.090 --> 18:54.341
IT IS YOU SHE MARKED!

18:54.424 --> 18:55.759
- DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME.

18:55.843 --> 18:58.011
I'M PERFECTLY CAPABLE
OF TAKING CARE OF MYSELF.

18:58.095 --> 19:01.390
OH, VICTOR,
LET'S GET THIS FINISHED.

19:01.473 --> 19:03.350
LET'S GET THE MASK.

19:03.433 --> 19:04.560
WE COULD BE RICH.

19:04.643 --> 19:05.644
WE CAN ESCAPE.

19:05.727 --> 19:08.564
[breathing heavily]

19:13.777 --> 19:15.779
- LITTERING
WILL NOT BE TOLERATED

19:15.863 --> 19:17.698
IN THIS SCHOOL.

19:17.781 --> 19:19.741
SEMPER SALUBRITAS.

19:19.825 --> 19:20.701
NO, STRONGER, STRONGER.

19:20.784 --> 19:23.287
SEMPER SALUBRITAS.

19:23.370 --> 19:25.247
[knock at door]

19:25.330 --> 19:29.459
I DON'T REMEMBER
SAYING "ENTER."

19:29.543 --> 19:30.711
- DO YOU WANT US
TO GO BACK OUT?

19:30.794 --> 19:33.005
- NO.
NO.

19:33.088 --> 19:33.797
COME.

19:33.881 --> 19:36.466
WELL, WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU?

19:36.550 --> 19:38.010
- YOU REMEMBER
THE LATEST JACKAL ARTICLE

19:38.093 --> 19:39.303
YOU SAID YOU LIKED?

19:39.386 --> 19:40.554
THE ONE ABOUT FATHERS AND SONS?

19:40.637 --> 19:43.765
- AH, YES, WRITTEN
BY THE ELUSIVE JACK JACKAL.

19:43.849 --> 19:47.185
MM.
[chuckles]

19:47.269 --> 19:49.187
OH, DEAR.

19:49.271 --> 19:49.938
YOU TWO HAVE WRITTEN IT,
HAVEN'T YOU?

19:50.022 --> 19:52.566
- NO, BUT WE KNOW WHO DID.

19:52.649 --> 19:56.945
THING IS, THIS PERSON HAS BEEN
WRITING UNDER A PSEUDONYM

19:57.029 --> 19:58.488
BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T WANT
TO GET IN TROUBLE.

19:58.572 --> 20:02.034
- BUT WE'D LIKE IT
IF YOU GAVE HER ANOTHER CHANCE.

20:02.117 --> 20:03.744
- HER.

20:03.827 --> 20:09.333
UM, MARA JAFFRAY.

20:12.211 --> 20:13.128
- LOOK.

20:13.211 --> 20:14.713
I INTERNET SEARCHED
"ANCIENT GAMES,"

20:14.796 --> 20:16.465
AND THIS IS WHAT CAME UP.

20:16.548 --> 20:18.550
- SENET. YES.

20:18.634 --> 20:19.927
- THAT'S OUR BOARD.

20:20.010 --> 20:21.428
- WELL, SIMILAR.

20:21.511 --> 20:24.473
LOOK, IT SAYS HERE THAT NO ONE
KNOWS THE EXACT RULES

20:24.556 --> 20:25.641
AS PLAYED
BY THE ANCIENT EGYPTIANS.

20:25.724 --> 20:27.643
- OH.

20:27.726 --> 20:29.394
- [sighs]
WELL, PRINT IT OFF.

20:29.478 --> 20:31.438
WE'LL BRING IT DOWN TONIGHT,
AND WE'LL COMPARE IT WITH OURS.

20:36.902 --> 20:38.862
- YOU KNOW,
I THOUGHT I WAS SNEAKY,

20:38.946 --> 20:41.490
BUT YOU ARE SOMETHING ELSE.

20:41.573 --> 20:42.658
- WHAT?

20:42.741 --> 20:43.659
- LISTEN UP, EVERYONE.

20:43.742 --> 20:45.035
WE HAVE AN ANNOUNCEMENT TO MAKE.

20:45.118 --> 20:47.537
- WE THOUGHT YOU SHOULD ALL KNOW

20:47.621 --> 20:50.374
THERE ARE TWO JACK JACKALS:

20:50.457 --> 20:54.002
THE REAL ONE WHO WRITES
A SHARP, INSIGHTFUL BLOG

20:54.086 --> 20:56.588
ABOUT STUFF THAT MATTERS...

20:56.672 --> 20:59.049
- AND THE ONE WHO CRITICIZES
HER CLASSMATES

20:59.132 --> 21:02.177
AND TAKES CREDIT FOR A BLOG
SHE DIDN'T WRITE.

21:02.260 --> 21:04.346
DO YOU WANT
TO TELL THEM THE TRUTH, JOY,

21:04.429 --> 21:06.640
OR SHALL I?

21:06.723 --> 21:08.183
- WHAT DID YOU DO?

21:08.266 --> 21:11.019
BLACKMAIL MARA
INTO KEEPING QUIET?

21:11.103 --> 21:13.438
- I NEVER BLACKMAILED YOU.

21:13.522 --> 21:14.856
- NO, IT'S TRUE.
SHE DIDN'T.

21:14.940 --> 21:16.483
- I WAS TRYING TO HELP YOU.

21:26.159 --> 21:28.704
- OH, AND SWEETIE HAS LIFTED
THE BAN ON YOU, MARA.

21:28.787 --> 21:30.038
YOU ARE NOW FREE
TO WRITE UNDER YOUR OWN NAME.

21:30.122 --> 21:32.457
ALL PART OF THE SERVICE.

21:37.337 --> 21:38.380
- ALL RIGHT.

21:38.463 --> 21:39.423
OKAY, SO IT'S BASICALLY
THE SAME GAME,

21:39.506 --> 21:42.175
EXCEPT WITHOUT
THE PLAYING PIECES.

21:42.259 --> 21:45.095
- AND THE GUARDS?
WHAT ARE THEY ALL ABOUT?

21:45.178 --> 21:46.179
- LET'S FACE IT.

21:46.263 --> 21:47.431
WE HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT WE'RE DOING.

21:47.514 --> 21:48.098
- IF ONLY WE HAD
THE DOLLHOUSE.

21:48.181 --> 21:50.225
IT COULD GIVE US A CLUE.

21:50.308 --> 21:51.601
- BUT WE HAVEN'T.

21:51.685 --> 21:54.354
SO THERE'S ONLY
ONE THING FOR HER.

21:54.438 --> 21:57.733
- NO, ALFIE!
- ALFIE, NO!

21:57.816 --> 21:59.276
- WAIT, WHAT'S HAPPENING?

21:59.359 --> 22:00.318
[magical whooshing]

22:00.402 --> 22:04.656
[all gasping]

22:04.740 --> 22:07.784
- NINA.

22:07.868 --> 22:08.326
- THE MASK OF ANUBIS.
