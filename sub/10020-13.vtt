ER

00:07.073 --> 00:09.156
Previously on ER...

00:11.680 --> 00:14.131
I'd invite you back to my place but...

00:14.132 --> 00:16.714
...I fear I'd be taking advantage.

00:18.532 --> 00:20.305
- I'm going to help.
- Help me!

00:20.306 --> 00:23.700
I'm gonna help you. I'm gonna help you,
but you gotta stick with me!

00:23.701 --> 00:26.071
But delaying the vote isn't an option.

00:26.072 --> 00:28.186
I can't support something
I don't believe in.

00:28.487 --> 00:32.012
When I was talking to Greg Powell,
it got intense.

00:32.214 --> 00:34.962
And I kissed him.

"Carter's Choice"

01:25.512 --> 01:26.973
- Touchdown!
- Nice catch.

01:27.183 --> 01:28.763
Hey, Dr. C. How'd you get in?

01:28.979 --> 01:32.020
I followed a snowplow in
from the Ryan.

01:32.236 --> 01:34.612
- Only one patient?
- Bumsicle, defrosting.

01:34.826 --> 01:36.026
Yo, Jer!

01:36.246 --> 01:38.455
How long will Weaver
keep you on nights?

01:38.668 --> 01:41.424
Her exact words were
"until hell freezes over. "

01:41.634 --> 01:43.713
I've been meaning to talk to her
about it.

01:43.930 --> 01:45.807
Would I look good in that cut?

01:46.019 --> 01:47.979
Honestly? No.

01:50.864 --> 01:53.489
What is the best approach with Weaver?

01:53.704 --> 01:56.377
- Contrition, indignation...?
- Begging.

01:56.545 --> 01:59.917
I think I would just appeal to
her innate sense of fairness.

02:00.136 --> 02:01.716
She has a sense of fairness?

02:01.890 --> 02:05.229
- Remind her you've been on nights for...
- Four months.

02:05.441 --> 02:08.066
...and that you think
your exemplary work history...

02:08.239 --> 02:11.494
...and your years of loyal service,
marred by only one incident...

02:11.705 --> 02:13.249
Blowing up the ambulance bay.

02:13.459 --> 02:17.509
...makes it incumbent upon her to bring
you back to the land of the living.

02:17.719 --> 02:19.299
I still say beg.

02:19.516 --> 02:20.596
Hey, Anna's on?

02:20.810 --> 02:23.270
Yeah. She's in Exam 4, sleeping.

02:31.127 --> 02:32.373
Yo, Carter.

02:37.225 --> 02:38.971
Nice throw!

03:26.129 --> 03:28.420
Carter?

03:30.848 --> 03:33.141
Hi.

03:33.689 --> 03:34.806
What time is it?

03:35.025 --> 03:37.021
It's 6. I didn't mean to wake you.

03:37.198 --> 03:38.694
I gotta get up anyway.

03:38.868 --> 03:41.244
Catch a few more minutes.
I'll get breakfast.

03:41.459 --> 03:42.836
You want a bagel, coffee?

03:43.046 --> 03:45.623
- Is it still snowing?
- Yeah.

03:46.429 --> 03:49.636
Yeah, they said we might get
3 more feet today.

03:50.062 --> 03:51.346
Maybe more.

03:51.567 --> 03:53.693
Here. I brought you a doughnut.

03:54.323 --> 03:56.236
Oh, thanks.

03:58.375 --> 03:59.408
How's Chase?

04:00.297 --> 04:04.431
He's off the clonidine.
He's weak, but up and around.

04:05.184 --> 04:06.597
Thanks for all your help.

04:07.106 --> 04:08.767
I was happy to.

04:14.040 --> 04:15.204
What?

04:17.172 --> 04:19.380
Well, I'll go get us some breakfast.

04:19.930 --> 04:21.212
Scrambled eggs.

04:21.391 --> 04:22.888
What?

04:23.062 --> 04:25.735
Scrambled eggs, please,
with wheat toast.

04:25.944 --> 04:28.819
Couple of blueberry pancakes
and an orange juice.

04:29.035 --> 04:30.116
Coming right up.

04:30.289 --> 04:32.498
Paramedics have a GSW,
massive blood loss.

04:32.711 --> 04:35.919
They're having a hell of a time.
Think they may lose him.

04:36.178 --> 04:37.460
Rain check on breakfast.

04:38.516 --> 04:40.311
- What do you got?
- Multiple GSWs...

04:40.481 --> 04:41.858
...to chest, abdomen, thigh.

04:42.026 --> 04:44.651
Blood loss is one liter.
Two liters saline in.

04:44.866 --> 04:47.824
Abdomen is tense.
No bowel sounds.

04:48.041 --> 04:50.832
Type and cross.
Get me six units O-neg down here.

04:51.048 --> 04:53.507
- Are we still short?
- It's stuck at O'Hare.

04:53.722 --> 04:56.477
We're low on blood.
With the storm, nobody's donating.

04:56.687 --> 04:59.563
Let's spin a crit.
Get a portable chest and a blood gas.

04:59.778 --> 05:01.572
Somebody use a machine gun on him?

05:01.741 --> 05:04.070
He's a security guard.
He interrupted a rape.

05:04.414 --> 05:06.576
Eight ET tube.
How long ago was he shot?

05:06.754 --> 05:09.926
At least 20 minutes.
We had to dig the rig out in Halsted.

05:10.095 --> 05:11.591
Hemopneumo. Chest tube tray.

05:11.808 --> 05:14.516
Rape victim's still on the scene.
Unit 57 has her.

05:14.731 --> 05:17.107
She must've been 70. Unbelievable.

05:17.865 --> 05:19.991
- How's the old woman?
- She's in rough shape.

05:20.163 --> 05:22.657
But it looks like he stopped her
from getting raped.

05:22.877 --> 05:24.457
- Got the blood.
- They catch the rapist?

05:24.673 --> 05:27.465
No. But cops are looking.
This guy might've shot him.

05:28.224 --> 05:29.305
Chest tube's in.

05:29.519 --> 05:32.643
Okay, good. Call the O.R.
and tell them we're on our way.

05:32.860 --> 05:34.939
- More blood?
- No. Save it.

05:35.533 --> 05:37.364
Have Respiratory meet us with a vent.

05:37.581 --> 05:40.206
- Maybe they'll catch him.
- It's about damn time.

05:40.421 --> 05:42.499
Maybe we can stop
at the cafeteria after.

05:42.718 --> 05:44.512
- Out of the way.
- What do you got?

05:44.723 --> 05:46.599
Multiple GSW on his way to the O.R.

05:46.811 --> 05:49.438
He saved an old woman
from being raped and got shot.

05:49.610 --> 05:50.691
How'd you get in?

05:50.906 --> 05:53.364
Oh, I took the El.
The car was stuck.

05:54.957 --> 05:56.121
- No pulse.
- What?

05:56.335 --> 05:58.378
- Idioventricular rhythm.
- Take him back.

05:58.549 --> 06:00.545
Careful. Hey, out of the way!

06:00.721 --> 06:03.560
Listen. Follow me.
We'll go around. Come on.

06:03.729 --> 06:05.391
- Whose patient?
- Mine.

06:05.566 --> 06:07.277
Thora-Seal's full.

06:07.614 --> 06:10.108
Probably a lacerated artery.
Cynthia?

06:11.164 --> 06:13.919
- He was stable.
- Well, he sure as hell isn't now.

06:14.297 --> 06:16.091
Careful.

06:16.260 --> 06:18.172
- Thoracotomy tray.
- Let's get more blood.

06:18.349 --> 06:19.513
- How much?
- All of it.

06:19.727 --> 06:22.268
- Should I order more?
- Yeah. At least four.

06:24.697 --> 06:27.240
Somebody shut off that damn alarm.

06:27.788 --> 06:29.915
Rib spreader.

06:37.145 --> 06:38.309
Pericardium is tense.

06:39.944 --> 06:42.319
Incise. Release the tamponade.
10 blade.

06:42.784 --> 06:45.493
Go laterally. Watch out
for the coronary arteries.

06:47.254 --> 06:48.334
Oh, suction!

06:48.507 --> 06:49.753
Come on, suction!

06:49.968 --> 06:51.168
Pickups.

06:51.639 --> 06:52.803
You're in my light.

06:53.017 --> 06:54.430
Four more O-neg are coming.

06:54.646 --> 06:55.847
Damn it!

06:56.026 --> 06:58.602
Left ventricle's shredded.
How many units in?

06:58.782 --> 07:01.111
- Three, fourth one's up.
- It's not enough to sew.

07:01.330 --> 07:02.826
We should still try.

07:03.042 --> 07:04.206
Save the blood.

07:04.379 --> 07:06.672
He stopped an old woman
from being raped.

07:06.886 --> 07:09.261
No good deed goes unpunished.

07:16.242 --> 07:17.905
- Time of death?
11.

07:19.417 --> 07:21.489
Son of a bitch!

08:15.034 --> 08:16.148
Don.

08:16.451 --> 08:18.159
- Good morning, Kerry.
- Morning.

08:18.327 --> 08:19.572
You're in early.

08:19.745 --> 08:23.658
I was anxious to hear the outcome
of last night's SPG vote.

08:23.873 --> 08:26.577
After careful consideration
and due in no small part...

08:26.791 --> 08:28.665
...to your glowing recommendation...

08:28.834 --> 08:31.205
...the board will begin negotiations
with SPG...

08:31.418 --> 08:34.171
...for an emergency department
management contract.

08:34.380 --> 08:36.171
I'm sorry to hear that.

08:37.548 --> 08:40.832
You have placed me
in a very awkward position, Kerry.

08:41.174 --> 08:43.499
I went to the board at your urging.

08:43.844 --> 08:46.927
Any misgivings you had about SPG
should've been aired weeks ago.

08:47.138 --> 08:48.880
If we reverse our position now...

08:49.097 --> 08:52.013
...we are going to look
very foolish indeed.

08:52.850 --> 08:54.925
I take it you have misgivings.

08:55.768 --> 08:57.048
Yes, I do.

08:58.020 --> 09:00.508
The board was anxious to know
if the senior...

09:00.813 --> 09:04.643
...ER staff was supportive of the idea.
You assured me they were.

09:04.816 --> 09:06.854
If you were incorrect
in that assessment...

09:07.067 --> 09:09.307
...and wish to admit that
before the board...

09:10.111 --> 09:12.399
...that might carry some weight.

09:13.071 --> 09:16.652
You want me to fall on my sword
in front of the board of directors.

09:16.865 --> 09:19.355
It is your sword, Kerry.

09:22.160 --> 09:24.531
So my lease is up February 1 st-

09:24.704 --> 09:27.194
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. Thanks, Mark.

09:27.414 --> 09:31.458
Jerry, get some mud mats here before
someone slips and kills themselves.

09:31.667 --> 09:35.579
Anyway, they want me to move
or sign a new lease for six months.

09:35.794 --> 09:37.916
I was month-to-month, but now they-

09:38.129 --> 09:40.701
- Three patients?
- It'll pick up when it stops snowing.

09:40.921 --> 09:43.377
Yeah, all those sick people
sitting at home...

09:43.591 --> 09:46.839
...waiting to rush in and ruin
our perfectly good slow day.

09:47.009 --> 09:49.416
57's on their way
with the rape victim.

09:49.635 --> 09:51.961
It seems silly for me
to be paying rent...

09:52.180 --> 09:55.049
...especially when I'm spending
every night at your place.

09:55.264 --> 09:58.928
Jerry, get mud mats down before
somebody slips and kills themselves.

09:59.142 --> 10:02.178
- Can I talk to you a little later?
- Yeah, sure.

10:02.478 --> 10:03.852
How much is your rent?

10:04.020 --> 10:06.558
450 now. But they want to
raise it to $500.

10:06.772 --> 10:09.013
I could probably help you out
with that.

10:09.690 --> 10:12.145
Oh. No, that's not what-

10:12.359 --> 10:14.316
You want to talk about this at dinner?

10:14.527 --> 10:17.313
- I made you feel uncomfortable.
- You didn't.

10:17.529 --> 10:20.529
- I have to get these up to the lab.
- Right.

10:21.198 --> 10:22.691
- What?
- Nothing.

10:22.907 --> 10:24.780
Randi called. She's snowed in.

10:24.992 --> 10:26.023
Perfect.

10:26.201 --> 10:28.951
Dr. Weaver, can I talk to you
for a minute?

10:31.830 --> 10:34.118
I've been working nights
for months now.

10:34.331 --> 10:37.664
And while I appreciate
that the accidental damage...

10:37.875 --> 10:40.580
...that I inflicted on the ER
cannot be dismissed...

10:40.794 --> 10:43.710
...as inconsequential
nor insignificant...

10:44.212 --> 10:47.711
...I do, however, believe that
my eight years of loyal service...

10:47.922 --> 10:51.422
...along with my sterling attendance
record and my seniority...

10:51.635 --> 10:55.962
...all demand that I get
my old day shift back.

10:56.971 --> 10:58.133
Is that it?

10:59.139 --> 11:01.890
I'm also appealing to
your innate sense of fairness.

11:02.058 --> 11:04.429
Can you work Randi's shift today?

11:05.393 --> 11:07.598
Pull a double? I'd love to.

11:07.811 --> 11:09.934
Fine. You're on days again.

11:10.981 --> 11:12.143
Anybody see Carter?

11:12.356 --> 11:15.937
- He went over to Doc's a while ago.
- God, I'm starving.

11:17.026 --> 11:19.065
Anna, breakfast is served.

11:19.278 --> 11:20.902
Oh, my God, John!

11:22.529 --> 11:24.236
Are you okay? You okay?

11:24.446 --> 11:25.856
Man, that smarts!

11:26.072 --> 11:28.694
Damn it, Jerry,
get those mud mats out here now.

11:29.117 --> 11:31.026
Ambulance is pulling up.

11:31.911 --> 11:33.867
I'm never gonna get my breakfast,
am I?

11:34.453 --> 11:35.828
Ready?

11:43.542 --> 11:45.618
A 72-year-old woman,
respiratory distress.

11:45.835 --> 11:47.792
Cyanotic. She's unresponsive.

11:48.004 --> 11:51.169
BP 90/70. Pulse 56.

11:51.381 --> 11:55.293
- Resps 32. GCS 10.
- This one's mine.

11:55.508 --> 11:58.628
The snow's too deep. We have to lift.
One, two, three.

11:58.845 --> 12:01.252
Two large-bore IVs,
10 liters 02 by mask.

12:01.471 --> 12:03.758
Unable to intubate
due to laryngeal edema.

12:03.930 --> 12:06.848
He tried to strangle her,
then pushed her down some stairs.

12:07.308 --> 12:09.181
Head trauma. Multiple contusions.

12:09.393 --> 12:11.598
We have a deformity of the left hip.

12:12.519 --> 12:15.270
Distal pulse is weak but present.

12:15.479 --> 12:19.891
Decreased air movement. Stridor on
respiration. Intercostal retraction.

12:20.108 --> 12:22.479
- Pulse ox is 88.
- Let's tube her.

12:22.692 --> 12:25.608
He caught her in her parking garage.
The guard make it?

12:25.820 --> 12:29.187
- The guard died on the table.
- Son of a bitch!

12:31.990 --> 12:34.361
I can't see the cords. Suction.

12:35.390 --> 12:37.124
WHORE

12:38.704 --> 12:42.200
Gave up on the Magic Marker.
Used a knife on her stomach.

12:42.789 --> 12:44.448
What do you want, doctor?

12:46.625 --> 12:50.040
Blood gas, CBC, Chem-7.

12:50.252 --> 12:52.872
Type and cross for six.

12:53.087 --> 12:54.996
Foley cath, dip a urine for blood.

12:55.215 --> 12:58.084
Cross-table C-spine, chest,
pelvis and left hip.

12:58.299 --> 13:00.375
- Let's do it.
- Another one?

13:01.133 --> 13:03.209
Damn it. I don't believe this.

13:03.385 --> 13:04.844
- How's the hangover?
- Painful.

13:05.011 --> 13:07.584
- No hard feelings, I hope.
- No, of course not.

13:08.640 --> 13:10.796
I'm really sorry.

13:10.974 --> 13:13.723
There's a novelty shop
down the street from my flat.

13:13.933 --> 13:17.349
You know, magic tricks,
rubber bugs, black soap.

13:17.562 --> 13:19.802
- I love that stuff, don't you?
- Not really.

13:19.980 --> 13:22.101
Oh. Sorry.

13:22.731 --> 13:24.771
Why are you so late?
It's not like you.

13:24.983 --> 13:27.817
Carla wants to put Reece in daycare.
He's not even a year.

13:28.110 --> 13:30.102
You won't get much sympathy from me.

13:30.319 --> 13:33.319
My mom gave me to a nurse
after I was born and went...

13:33.531 --> 13:35.189
...to Spain for three weeks.

13:35.407 --> 13:39.272
It was nannies after that and
boarding school by the time I was 5.

13:39.492 --> 13:42.906
Anytime, Dr. Benton. This colectomy's
not getting any younger.

13:43.119 --> 13:44.235
Okay.

13:44.954 --> 13:47.954
So, anyway, I'm on the phone
with this nanny service.

13:48.165 --> 13:50.654
450 a week after taxes.

13:50.875 --> 13:52.582
That's two-thirds of my take-home.

13:53.751 --> 13:56.324
- Got any lunch plans?
- I doubt I'll have time.

13:57.003 --> 13:58.580
I'm buying!

14:00.339 --> 14:01.453
It's a mess out there.

14:01.673 --> 14:05.752
- Schools are closed, but we still work.
- Honey, we always gotta work.

14:06.677 --> 14:08.668
Pretty slim pickings. Any pedes?

14:08.886 --> 14:09.965
Not a one.

14:10.178 --> 14:12.633
Gives me time to work on my dictation.

14:12.847 --> 14:14.424
What's going on over there?

14:14.849 --> 14:18.548
Another elderly rape victim.
The cops might catch him this time.

14:18.767 --> 14:21.055
They got him cornered
in an old warehouse.

14:21.269 --> 14:23.060
I hope those dogs tear him up.

14:23.270 --> 14:24.978
Yep. No kidding.

14:46.035 --> 14:47.862
- You okay?
- Yes.

14:51.206 --> 14:52.449
No.

14:54.208 --> 14:57.041
I mean, he's your best friend, right?

14:57.250 --> 14:58.791
Mark? Yeah. He's-

14:59.001 --> 15:00.792
I don't understand.

15:01.628 --> 15:03.667
We have great times together.

15:03.880 --> 15:06.880
We laugh. We enjoy each other.

15:07.049 --> 15:09.171
I sleep over there every single night.

15:09.383 --> 15:13.878
I know that I make him happy.
I know I do. I can tell.

15:15.512 --> 15:18.714
He just keeps giving me
these mixed signals.

15:19.722 --> 15:22.213
Well, I mean- We have-
Have you-?

15:22.893 --> 15:24.302
Have you talked to him?

15:24.518 --> 15:29.225
Yeah, I talk about it to him
lots of times, but he just avoids it.

15:32.815 --> 15:35.602
We usually end up having
sex instead, though.

15:37.359 --> 15:38.734
Is it me?

15:40.028 --> 15:43.442
Does he think that maybe I'm not
good enough for him? Is that it?

15:45.114 --> 15:46.739
Or is he just...?

15:46.907 --> 15:50.240
Is he just scared because
he cares so much?

15:52.453 --> 15:53.732
Okay, let's bag her.

15:53.912 --> 15:55.156
Babinski's down-going.

15:55.579 --> 15:56.908
Pulse ox is coming up.

15:57.747 --> 15:58.947
X- rays.

16:00.958 --> 16:02.037
Excuse me.

16:02.251 --> 16:06.082
It's getting crowded in here.
Wait outside and we'll let you know.

16:09.297 --> 16:11.123
Hip's dislocated.

16:11.340 --> 16:13.248
Pop it back in
before we take her to CT?

16:13.425 --> 16:17.088
Yeah. We can get post-reduction film
after the non-contrast CT.

16:17.302 --> 16:18.713
Thanks. Vitals?

16:18.928 --> 16:22.094
BP's 110/70. Pulse 88.

16:24.849 --> 16:25.927
Ready?

16:31.020 --> 16:33.308
Call CT. Tell them to set up a vent.

16:34.563 --> 16:36.270
Okay, let's go.

16:38.107 --> 16:40.265
Send a blood gas from CT.

16:40.484 --> 16:44.018
And repeat a chest x-ray
when she gets back here.

16:48.489 --> 16:49.769
How's she doing?

16:49.991 --> 16:52.942
Well, her vitals are normal.
They put her hip back in.

16:53.367 --> 16:55.442
I'll get our stuff back to the rig.

16:57.620 --> 16:58.947
You okay?

16:59.788 --> 17:00.950
Yeah.

17:02.873 --> 17:05.243
Connie, what do you do for child-care?

17:05.458 --> 17:07.367
I got a sitter. It was a nightmare.

17:07.584 --> 17:10.156
Ran up my phone bill,
ate me out of house and home.

17:10.377 --> 17:12.287
- Eight bucks an hour.
- Eight bucks?

17:12.462 --> 17:14.289
My sister's paying 10.

17:14.505 --> 17:18.123
I finally gave up. Put him
upstairs in daycare. They love it.

17:18.299 --> 17:20.290
Aren't they sick being around
other kids?

17:20.468 --> 17:22.126
- Sure.
- Builds their immune system.

17:22.301 --> 17:24.294
A girl in my building babysits.

17:24.470 --> 17:26.627
She's not that expensive.
Want me to call her?

17:26.847 --> 17:28.305
Need a babysitter, Peter?

17:28.513 --> 17:30.470
Carla wants to put Reece into daycare.

17:30.641 --> 17:33.973
You' re uncomfortable with that?
Jerry, any more dictations for me?

17:34.185 --> 17:35.809
My mother raised us at home.

17:36.020 --> 17:38.972
You're a product of a bygone era.
Join the modern world.

17:39.188 --> 17:42.022
I'm gonna do these in Sutures
if anybody needs me.

17:48.278 --> 17:50.020
Dr. Ross?

17:50.738 --> 17:52.065
Pedes is short-staffed.

17:52.279 --> 17:54.187
Can you look at a newborn in OB?

17:54.406 --> 17:57.309
- Yeah, fine.
- Thanks.

18:02.500 --> 18:03.780
See you later.

18:09.465 --> 18:11.755
Doug. Doug, come on.

18:11.967 --> 18:13.629
Is that the guy?

18:13.803 --> 18:15.381
We were talking. He was upset.

18:15.596 --> 18:18.800
Another elderly rape victim came in.
I was trying to calm him down.

18:19.017 --> 18:20.677
Was that the guy?

18:22.312 --> 18:23.723
Yes. That's the guy.

18:23.939 --> 18:25.813
But I'm not seeing him or anything.

18:26.025 --> 18:29.191
You can't commit, fine.
You want to screw firemen, fine.

18:29.403 --> 18:31.442
Don't humiliate me
in front of my friends.

18:31.655 --> 18:33.529
Humiliate you?

18:34.742 --> 18:37.279
What about the surgical tech
in the on-call room?

18:37.494 --> 18:38.824
- The Pedes nurse?
- Ancient history.

18:39.039 --> 18:41.659
How about the drug rep with
fake breasts and big hair?

18:41.874 --> 18:44.709
- Ancient history.
- I'd have to do the entire Bulls lineup...

18:44.877 --> 18:46.337
...before I equaled you.

18:46.504 --> 18:50.169
Is this about getting even for things
I did a long time ago?

18:50.675 --> 18:52.466
This is about me needing some time...

18:52.677 --> 18:56.176
...and you being pissed that things
aren't working out as planned.

18:56.348 --> 18:59.552
I have spent years,
years of my life...

18:59.726 --> 19:02.726
...changing to fit your needs,
working around your schedules...

19:02.937 --> 19:05.608
...your insecurities,
your inabilities to commit.

19:06.067 --> 19:08.523
Well, you know what?
It's not all about you.

19:10.279 --> 19:12.521
I know that may come as a shock.

19:12.865 --> 19:15.438
But a relationship is give and take.

19:15.660 --> 19:18.530
Two people as equals,
and right now I need something.

19:19.205 --> 19:23.416
So you can grow up and accept it,
or you can go on being the same...

19:23.625 --> 19:25.915
...self-centered bastard
you've always been...

19:26.129 --> 19:29.545
...and refuse to give me
the one thing I've ever asked you for.

19:35.973 --> 19:38.345
Mark, we're precariously short
of blood.

19:38.516 --> 19:42.644
I'm gonna ask the staff to volunteer,
rotate our people upstairs to donate.

19:42.854 --> 19:46.225
- We don't have many patients anyway.
- Sounds smart.

19:46.484 --> 19:49.853
The board voted yesterday to begin
negotiations with Synergix...

19:50.070 --> 19:51.897
...to take over management of the ER.

19:52.114 --> 19:54.902
Congratulations.
It's what you wanted, right?

19:55.119 --> 19:58.451
Yes and no. I've had disturbing
reports from other hospitals...

19:58.663 --> 20:00.739
...about their
cross-control techniques.

20:01.040 --> 20:02.238
Did you talk to Anspaugh?

20:02.458 --> 20:05.958
He felt that if all the ER
Attendings opposed the decision...

20:06.171 --> 20:08.163
...that would help scuttle the deal.

20:08.381 --> 20:11.715
But won't that make us look
ridiculous? We recommended it.

20:11.927 --> 20:14.418
But the heat doesn't fall
on any one person...

20:14.597 --> 20:16.423
...if we all go to the board together.

20:16.640 --> 20:19.012
I've started contacting
the other Attendings.

20:19.226 --> 20:22.478
And I was hoping that I could
count on your support.

20:22.688 --> 20:25.262
Show me the statistics
and I'll let you know.

20:25.483 --> 20:28.020
Great, thanks.
Mark, cops caught that rapist.

20:28.194 --> 20:30.435
GSW to the chest.
Paramedics are bringing him.

20:30.613 --> 20:32.025
- Here?
- That's what they said.

20:32.240 --> 20:35.443
- Tell them we don't want him.
- Let Mercy take him. Or Rush.

20:35.618 --> 20:37.907
Malik, prep Trauma 2
and alert Surgery.

20:39.830 --> 20:40.945
Come on, people.

20:44.670 --> 20:47.042
There's no evidence of penetration.

20:47.715 --> 20:50.002
Thank God for small favors.

20:51.635 --> 20:53.628
Who does something like this?

20:53.971 --> 20:56.640
I don't know. I hope they find
the guy that did this.

20:56.849 --> 20:59.969
They should shoot him and toss
his body in the dumpster.

21:02.981 --> 21:04.060
How's it going?

21:04.273 --> 21:05.388
Great.

21:05.858 --> 21:07.020
Really?

21:07.193 --> 21:10.527
Cynthia cried on my shoulder for
an hour. What's that all about?

21:10.906 --> 21:13.194
- Her lease is up.
- You want my opinion?

21:13.407 --> 21:15.235
- Not particularly.
- Fine.

21:16.661 --> 21:18.903
- How's Carol?
- She talk to you about it?

21:19.331 --> 21:20.992
- About what?
- Nothing.

21:21.833 --> 21:23.873
We have a nasty MVA on the Kennedy.

21:24.086 --> 21:26.755
And a family in a minivan
hit an overpass.

21:26.964 --> 21:29.086
And that rapist is here.

21:33.512 --> 21:34.923
You should talk.

21:36.973 --> 21:38.006
Two IVs in...

21:38.183 --> 21:41.434
...no pulse, large-caliber GSW
to the chest.

21:41.646 --> 21:45.595
Multiple contusions, canine bites
and open fracture to the left femur.

21:45.817 --> 21:47.061
Damn! He's just a kid.

21:47.276 --> 21:49.103
Nineteen. Name is Jack Miller.

21:50.781 --> 21:53.353
We'll leave him on
the paramedic gurney. Who's up?

21:53.533 --> 21:54.648
Carter.

21:55.326 --> 21:56.869
No breath sounds.

21:57.037 --> 21:58.829
- The rapist?
- One of you get him?

21:59.040 --> 22:00.831
He was hiding. The dogs found him.

22:01.042 --> 22:02.785
Too bad they called the dogs off.

22:02.959 --> 22:05.285
Another 20 minutes would've
saved us the trouble.

22:05.504 --> 22:06.535
Got a rhythm.

22:06.713 --> 22:09.205
- Should I set up another drip?
- Nope.

22:09.467 --> 22:11.625
- What's going on, Dr. Carter?
- PEA.

22:12.553 --> 22:14.344
Yeah. What's the differential?

22:14.889 --> 22:17.890
Hypovolemia, hypoxia,
tension pneumo...

22:18.100 --> 22:22.597
...pulmonary embolism,
pericardial effusion, tamponade.

22:22.938 --> 22:25.346
- How's the old lady?
- She's gonna be fine.

22:25.566 --> 22:28.237
- Chuny?
- Bradycardic, 48.

22:28.529 --> 22:31.197
- What do you want to do?
- Let the bastard die.

22:31.698 --> 22:34.818
Like every other patient,
he gets our best effort.

22:35.035 --> 22:37.407
Dr. Carter?

22:38.456 --> 22:41.576
Amp of epi, IV push
and a milligram of atropine.

22:44.545 --> 22:45.826
You heard him. Let's go.

22:46.839 --> 22:49.378
- What about an airway?
- Yeah. He needs one.

22:49.592 --> 22:50.754
Let's put one in.

22:50.926 --> 22:53.548
Mark, that MVA is here.
The mother's in trouble.

22:53.762 --> 22:55.257
I'll be right there.

22:56.682 --> 22:59.091
- Malik, you're with me.
- Thank God!

22:59.310 --> 23:01.101
Call me if you need anything.

23:01.938 --> 23:03.183
She threw up last night.

23:03.398 --> 23:05.057
No. Only a little bit.

23:05.274 --> 23:08.976
I ate some Saltines like my sister
told me to. That usually works.

23:09.195 --> 23:10.394
Do you throw up often?

23:10.615 --> 23:13.780
I always eat the Saltines
and then it goes away.

23:13.950 --> 23:17.735
Last night she ate a whole thing
of Cherry Garcia.

23:17.954 --> 23:20.078
Cherry Garcia is my favorite too.

23:21.667 --> 23:24.953
Are you having them again?
Have you had these pains before?

23:25.171 --> 23:28.042
Sometimes I hurt a little bit,
but it goes away.

23:28.257 --> 23:29.800
They just keep coming back.

23:30.010 --> 23:31.918
Coming back how often?

23:33.178 --> 23:34.839
When? How many? Eight?

23:35.055 --> 23:38.010
During Kathie Lee
about eight or nine times.

23:38.227 --> 23:43.137
Okay. I want you to just lie back
and I'm gonna take a quick look.

23:43.315 --> 23:45.473
- Am I okay?
- You just relax.

23:45.693 --> 23:47.566
Legs apart. Good.

23:49.363 --> 23:51.984
Okay. All right.

23:53.992 --> 23:56.780
- She's seven centimeters.
- I'll get the fetal monitor.

23:56.996 --> 23:58.739
Just keep breathing.

23:59.665 --> 24:02.452
- Weak pulse.
- No breath sounds on the left.

24:02.668 --> 24:04.078
Neck veins are dilated.

24:04.294 --> 24:07.213
- Tension pneumo?
- Sounds about right.

24:07.925 --> 24:09.501
32 French.

24:12.095 --> 24:15.678
- What are you doing?
- Central line. He'll need volume.

24:15.850 --> 24:18.554
The victim's coming to.
You guys want to talk to her?

24:31.531 --> 24:33.489
Damn it!

24:33.658 --> 24:35.202
He's losing a lot of blood here.

24:35.369 --> 24:37.860
- You want me to go get Mark?
- Nope.

24:40.457 --> 24:44.041
He's bleeding out. He's already
lost a liter. He needs blood.

24:45.380 --> 24:48.630
- How many units O-neg do we have?
- This is it. Four units.

24:55.724 --> 24:57.716
- Let's autotransfuse him.
- You're kidding.

24:57.893 --> 25:00.051
- Use his own blood?
- Hook up the cell saver.

25:00.270 --> 25:02.393
- He needs a transfusion.
- He'll get one.

25:02.605 --> 25:05.014
There's not enough.
It's all over the floor.

25:05.233 --> 25:06.693
This'll be fine.

25:06.902 --> 25:08.693
- He needs blood.
- And he'll get it!

25:08.904 --> 25:11.596
Hook it up to the central line.
Wide open.

25:23.090 --> 25:24.205
Shooting.

25:24.425 --> 25:28.174
AP pelvis next. Call me when
you're ready. I'll be next door.

25:29.681 --> 25:30.796
How's he doing?

25:30.975 --> 25:33.763
He has a massive hemothorax
from the gunshot wound.

25:33.979 --> 25:36.222
Possibly to the pulmonary artery.

25:36.440 --> 25:39.311
We autotransfused him from
the Thora-Seal. BP's at 80 palp.

25:39.486 --> 25:40.980
No kidding, you autotransfused?

25:41.197 --> 25:44.781
Alerted the O.R.
I think he's stable enough to travel.

25:44.951 --> 25:46.660
Then let's send him up.

25:50.125 --> 25:52.746
- Anna, you coming?
- No. Thanks. Carter's got it.

25:54.255 --> 25:58.124
Overweight 62-year-old
shoveling 2 feet of wet snow.

25:58.344 --> 25:59.968
I wonder why he's having an Ml.

26:00.179 --> 26:04.013
Word is you're mustering opposition
to SPG among the ER Attendings.

26:04.226 --> 26:05.887
I have to do what is right.

26:06.104 --> 26:09.189
- The board approved the deal.
- Maybe they can be dissuaded.

26:09.400 --> 26:11.807
Come back here.
Come here. Come here.

26:14.323 --> 26:17.028
Now, I've put months of work
into this already.

26:17.243 --> 26:19.616
You should've addressed
concerns weeks ago.

26:19.829 --> 26:21.657
You should've been more forthcoming...

26:21.834 --> 26:23.910
...about your cost-containment
strategies.

26:24.086 --> 26:25.415
We're a public company.

26:25.629 --> 26:30.091
Whatever we do is spelled out in
our literature. Did you read that?

26:30.302 --> 26:33.007
I couldn't find it
in all the rosy profit predictions...

26:33.181 --> 26:35.506
...and glossy photos
of satisfied patients.

26:35.725 --> 26:39.854
You're the one that wants to turn this
ER into a cost-effective operation.

26:40.022 --> 26:43.439
You couldn't anticipate what
would be needed to make it profitable?

26:43.652 --> 26:45.692
I'm willing to make hard choices,
Ellis.

26:45.905 --> 26:48.396
I'm not willing to endanger patients.

26:48.575 --> 26:50.651
You're questioning my ethics
as a physician?

26:50.871 --> 26:53.078
I'm not sure. Maybe.
Hang on, Carol.

26:53.290 --> 26:55.532
You used me.
That's what we've been about.

26:55.752 --> 26:59.085
You used me to get this deal.
I don't like being used!

26:59.297 --> 27:01.837
You underestimated me once.
And you were right to.

27:02.052 --> 27:05.635
But don't underestimate me again.
I'll see you at the board.

27:06.890 --> 27:08.054
Are you okay?

27:08.225 --> 27:09.684
The patient, Carol.

27:09.894 --> 27:12.019
27-year-old woman, 35 weeks.

27:12.232 --> 27:14.521
Seven centimeters dilated.
Fully effaced.

27:14.734 --> 27:16.277
Get her up to OB.

27:16.487 --> 27:19.274
She won't go. She's scared
they'll take her baby away.

27:19.490 --> 27:20.654
What?

27:20.910 --> 27:24.410
She's retarded. She wants to leave.
I treated her at the clinic.

27:24.622 --> 27:27.328
I think she'll stay
if we keep her down here.

27:27.542 --> 27:28.622
I'm going home.

27:28.836 --> 27:30.711
You can't go home.
You're having a baby.

27:30.923 --> 27:32.880
Robert, where are my shoes?

27:33.092 --> 27:36.592
Mary, hi. I'm Dr. Weaver.
Where are you going?

27:36.804 --> 27:40.423
Mary, sit down here and let
Dr. Weaver examine you, okay?

27:40.601 --> 27:43.437
If you go home it could be
very bad for your baby.

27:43.605 --> 27:47.603
You love your baby and you don't want
anything bad to happen, right?

27:47.819 --> 27:50.775
So let me look, and we can
talk about what we should do.

27:51.323 --> 27:53.316
Please? For your baby?

27:54.828 --> 27:59.290
Good. Jeanie, let's- Here we go.
- get her on a fetal monitor.

27:59.459 --> 28:02.460
And that's so we can check
your baby's heart.

28:02.964 --> 28:05.253
- Is it a boy or a girl?
- A girl.

28:05.425 --> 28:06.456
How exciting.

28:06.676 --> 28:09.797
And why are you afraid to go upstairs
to have your baby?

28:10.306 --> 28:12.181
They'll take her.

28:12.350 --> 28:13.893
Why will they take her?

28:14.144 --> 28:16.137
That's what Judy said.

28:16.355 --> 28:17.767
- Who's Judy?
- Her sister.

28:18.442 --> 28:19.640
Nine centimeters.

28:19.819 --> 28:23.817
- Do you live with your sister?
- No. We live at 5214 East Chestnut.

28:24.409 --> 28:26.815
We don't take babies with
such nice parents.

28:26.994 --> 28:29.486
So why don't you stay here with us?

28:29.665 --> 28:32.157
And we'll make sure
everything's going okay.

28:32.335 --> 28:34.162
When did it stop snowing?

28:34.671 --> 28:36.545
I didn't know that it had.

28:38.134 --> 28:42.050
Only the finest culinary offerings
from the 3rd floor vending machine.

28:43.516 --> 28:45.343
Tuna or cheese?

28:45.561 --> 28:48.348
I didn't know if you were
a truly fanatical vegan...

28:48.565 --> 28:52.265
...or whether seafood's allowed to
pass your lips every so often.

28:54.030 --> 28:55.274
Cheese, please.

28:55.490 --> 28:57.199
A true believer.

28:57.367 --> 29:01.615
I must say I do enjoy a good hunk
of rare meat every so often.

29:04.835 --> 29:07.956
How long's it been since you've had
something really juicy?

29:10.217 --> 29:12.792
I don't know. Six years.

29:13.012 --> 29:14.044
I thought as much.

29:14.347 --> 29:16.306
- Egg?
- No.

29:18.562 --> 29:22.346
- Pity.
- No. I eat eggs. I just...

29:22.566 --> 29:23.895
I just...

29:29.576 --> 29:32.945
I've had a thought.

29:34.372 --> 29:37.329
I have no family here. No ties.

29:37.545 --> 29:39.087
No time.

29:39.296 --> 29:42.382
You have the baby, but not much else.

29:43.218 --> 29:46.423
And with our schedules,
it makes it almost impossible to...

29:46.640 --> 29:48.799
...date or even really meet someone...

29:49.017 --> 29:52.434
...much less anything approaching
a real relationship.

29:56.194 --> 29:57.736
So I was thinking.

29:58.196 --> 30:00.522
We're both adults...

30:00.699 --> 30:01.778
...attractive...

30:03.453 --> 30:05.245
...we enjoy each other.

30:07.958 --> 30:09.703
Why not?

30:14.384 --> 30:16.129
I won't disappoint.

30:26.483 --> 30:28.476
I've made you blush.

30:34.159 --> 30:37.494
I don't think I'd be
comfortable with that.

30:39.375 --> 30:40.833
That's a pity.

30:49.178 --> 30:51.671
I heard the rapist made it.
Good job, Carter.

30:51.849 --> 30:55.599
Anybody seen Doug? I'll need a
pediatrician to check out a newborn.

30:55.771 --> 30:57.396
He's up at Pedes.
I'll page him.

30:57.607 --> 30:59.647
- I'm around if you can't find him.
- Thanks.

30:59.859 --> 31:02.861
- You ever get anything to eat?
- I lost my appetite, thanks.

31:03.072 --> 31:06.656
I'm looking for my sister,
Mary Cochran. She's having a baby.

31:06.869 --> 31:10.155
Hi. Yes, she sure is.
I'm Carol Hathaway. Come with me.

31:12.083 --> 31:14.706
- Is she all right?
- She's doing great. Not long now.

31:14.921 --> 31:16.084
Can I see her?

31:16.297 --> 31:18.041
Sure. I have to ask her first.

31:18.217 --> 31:20.008
Hi, Mary. How you doing?
I'm back.

31:20.219 --> 31:22.711
- She's crowning.
- Keep pushing.

31:22.931 --> 31:27.226
- Four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10.
- Oh, boy! Oh, boy!

31:27.395 --> 31:30.562
Good. Good. Now don't push.

31:31.692 --> 31:33.817
- This is hard.
- You're doing great.

31:34.029 --> 31:37.944
She's ROA. How you doing, Robert?
You're not gonna faint, are you?

31:38.159 --> 31:39.273
I'm okay.

31:39.494 --> 31:43.445
Somebody get Robert a chair just
in case he feels like sitting down.

31:43.666 --> 31:45.873
- Your sister's outside, Mary.
- Judy?

31:46.085 --> 31:48.578
- She wants to know if she can come in.
- Yes.

31:48.756 --> 31:50.999
- Carol, can you give me a hand?
- Yep.

31:51.175 --> 31:52.375
All right, Mary.

31:53.096 --> 31:55.089
- Just one more time.
- I'm here, honey.

31:55.307 --> 31:57.880
All right. Let's give it
everything you got, okay?

31:58.060 --> 32:02.557
One, two, three, four, five...

32:02.733 --> 32:06.861
...six, seven, eight, nine-

32:07.029 --> 32:10.197
- There she is!
- I see the head! Look at that hair!

32:10.408 --> 32:11.952
Oh, wow!

32:12.120 --> 32:15.121
Looks like you need someone
with pediatric experience.

32:15.582 --> 32:18.418
Oh, look. She's beautiful.

32:20.631 --> 32:23.965
Okay, Mary, this is just
the last little bit.

32:28.140 --> 32:29.219
She's out!

32:29.808 --> 32:31.968
Oh, my God!

32:32.146 --> 32:33.426
Oh, my God!

32:33.647 --> 32:35.972
Welcome to the world, Madison.

32:37.152 --> 32:38.611
Is she okay?

32:38.820 --> 32:41.776
Yeah, 10 fingers and 10 toes.

32:41.991 --> 32:44.068
Okay, Dad, get in here
and cut the cord.

32:44.286 --> 32:45.781
Come on, Robert, you can do it.

32:46.831 --> 32:48.325
- There?
- That's the spot there.

32:50.170 --> 32:51.415
Good.

32:52.214 --> 32:53.412
Good.

32:55.008 --> 32:57.001
She's so small.

33:00.141 --> 33:02.050
Hello, baby.

33:02.435 --> 33:04.013
Hello, little baby.

33:04.229 --> 33:06.352
Ten units Pitocin IV.

33:07.440 --> 33:08.816
Thank you.

33:09.153 --> 33:10.813
Thank you so much.

33:12.448 --> 33:14.406
Thank you so much.

33:14.784 --> 33:16.031
You're welcome.

33:21.908 --> 33:23.236
Is the baby okay mentally?

33:23.451 --> 33:26.738
Well, it's too soon to tell.
But she seems fine, alert.

33:26.956 --> 33:29.875
There's no reason to think
she won't be perfectly normal.

33:32.922 --> 33:34.547
When do the social workers come?

33:36.676 --> 33:38.004
They don't.

33:39.639 --> 33:43.174
We don't call Social Services when
there are two loving adult parents.

33:44.853 --> 33:47.427
You seem nice, so I hope
you won't think me rude.

33:47.648 --> 33:49.939
Do you have the training
to assess that?

33:50.110 --> 33:52.269
They're doing fine with the baby.

33:52.487 --> 33:54.813
They have their own apartment.
Robert works.

33:55.032 --> 33:58.284
Robert is the janitor at
his uncle's muffler repair shop.

33:59.204 --> 34:02.789
They don't drive because they don't
read well enough to pass the test.

34:03.001 --> 34:07.295
They have a place, but I do their bills
and remind them to do their laundry.

34:07.506 --> 34:10.924
They are sweet, loving people,
but they can't care for an infant.

34:14.389 --> 34:17.094
Do you think you're qualified
to make that assessment?

34:17.978 --> 34:19.887
You know, I wish that I weren't.

34:21.817 --> 34:24.485
I can't tell you how much
I wish that I weren't.

34:27.657 --> 34:31.025
Did you get a chance to look over
those Synergix reports?

34:31.245 --> 34:33.154
- Not very encouraging.
- You're with me?

34:33.371 --> 34:34.652
Whatever you think's best.

34:34.873 --> 34:37.283
Would somebody
please answer the phone?

34:37.460 --> 34:39.704
- ER.
- The board meets next Tuesday.

34:39.880 --> 34:41.589
Can I count on you to be there?

34:41.800 --> 34:43.080
If I don't have to speak.

34:43.301 --> 34:46.172
Why isn't anybody answering the phone?
Where is Cynthia?

34:46.346 --> 34:49.183
Cynthia left hours ago.
She seemed upset.

34:49.391 --> 34:50.674
- She left?
- Yeah.

34:50.853 --> 34:54.518
Jerry? Jerry? Jerry!

34:54.690 --> 34:56.898
- What?
- Answer the damn phone!

34:57.112 --> 35:00.195
The blood's here from O'Hare.
The blood bank's restocked.

35:02.325 --> 35:03.904
I was looking for you upstairs.

35:04.119 --> 35:07.656
I had a hot appendix turn out to be
unrefrigerated 3-day-old pizza.

35:07.875 --> 35:10.495
- Do you have the forms?
- Hold on. Where's Reece?

35:10.711 --> 35:12.538
- In the car.
- You left him in the car?

35:12.713 --> 35:14.339
He's with a friend.

35:14.508 --> 35:16.964
Dafina? Carla, she better
not be smoking.

35:17.178 --> 35:18.885
Peter, did you sign the forms?

35:19.264 --> 35:21.636
I'm sorry. I've been working all day.

35:22.685 --> 35:25.222
I need those forms so Reece
can start on Monday.

35:25.855 --> 35:27.184
- Monday?
- Yes!

35:27.399 --> 35:28.728
Are you gonna sign them?

35:29.234 --> 35:32.021
I don't know. I was
checking out other alternatives.

35:32.447 --> 35:34.439
- Forget it. Just forget it.
- What?

35:34.658 --> 35:38.158
Look, I'm not convinced this is
the best thing for the baby.

35:38.329 --> 35:39.989
Thanks for the vote of confidence.

35:40.206 --> 35:42.330
I deserve more than one day
to decide.

35:42.709 --> 35:45.201
Fine. Take a week, a month.
Hell, take six.

35:45.422 --> 35:47.545
Just tell me what's right for my life.

35:47.758 --> 35:49.882
It's not just your decision to make.

35:51.930 --> 35:53.673
Peter.

35:53.848 --> 35:56.092
Wait! Where do you think
you're going?

35:56.268 --> 35:57.977
To see my son. He's in the car.

35:58.188 --> 35:59.847
Peter, get back inside.

36:00.065 --> 36:02.188
What? Is Dafina in here
smoking again?

36:02.401 --> 36:04.395
Come by later. You can see him then.

36:14.250 --> 36:16.326
Peter Benton, Roger McGrath.

36:16.544 --> 36:18.583
Roger McGrath, Peter Benton.

36:19.464 --> 36:22.631
Roger, will you put Reece
in the car seat, please?

36:25.264 --> 36:28.633
Peter, I've been meaning to
talk to you about this.

36:28.976 --> 36:31.052
He works with Chandra over at the CTA.

36:31.563 --> 36:34.138
He's steady. I mean, he's smart...

36:36.278 --> 36:37.736
...and Reece loves him.

36:37.945 --> 36:39.820
All in. You take care now.

36:43.452 --> 36:46.788
If you want to talk about this later,
give me a call, okay?

36:50.628 --> 36:51.908
Hey, Scoot.

36:52.255 --> 36:53.716
Hey, Chase.

36:55.968 --> 36:57.761
You asked me to drop by today.

36:57.971 --> 37:00.841
Oh, right. Right. Right.
How are you feeling?

37:01.058 --> 37:02.932
I've been better.

37:03.520 --> 37:06.890
Nothing some crank and a half gallon
of Stoli's wouldn't fix.

37:07.358 --> 37:09.980
- It was a joke.
- That's not very funny.

37:10.195 --> 37:13.362
Hang out for a sec.
There's a patient I don't want to miss.

37:13.825 --> 37:16.530
- Hey, Anna.
- Hi there, Chase. How are you?

37:16.703 --> 37:18.992
Oh, great.
Never better, thanks to you.

37:19.205 --> 37:20.784
Your cousin did all the work.

37:21.000 --> 37:24.536
When do you get off work?
I could take you and Anna to dinner.

37:24.755 --> 37:27.045
Actually, I've gotta run.

37:27.300 --> 37:29.872
Maybe some other time. Take care.

37:33.308 --> 37:34.553
Trouble in paradise?

37:34.767 --> 37:36.392
Something like that.

37:37.020 --> 37:38.977
Are you gonna go after her?

37:39.940 --> 37:42.231
If you don't, I will.

37:42.401 --> 37:44.941
- Have you seen Carol?
- She's down the hall.

37:45.114 --> 37:47.236
A retarded couple had a baby
this afternoon.

37:47.449 --> 37:49.942
She's teaching them
how to change diapers.

37:50.161 --> 37:51.442
No kidding?

37:51.664 --> 37:52.992
A little girl.

37:53.207 --> 37:56.411
Six pounds, seven ounces.
Name's Madison. Seems fine.

37:56.587 --> 37:57.962
Good for her.

37:58.172 --> 38:01.090
Listen, Cynthia left early.

38:01.300 --> 38:03.259
Chuny said she was upset.

38:03.679 --> 38:05.387
I'm going to talk to her.

38:05.932 --> 38:08.553
- I know what I'm doing, Doug.
- If you say so.

38:12.940 --> 38:14.601
We saved that rapist today.

38:15.068 --> 38:16.610
Hell of a world, huh?

38:16.820 --> 38:18.279
Yeah. I'll see you later.

38:20.658 --> 38:25.036
Anna. Anna!

38:26.832 --> 38:28.790
What the hell's the matter with you?

38:29.627 --> 38:32.464
Go back inside.
You'll freeze your ass off out here.

38:33.508 --> 38:36.759
I don't understand.
This morning everything was great.

38:37.137 --> 38:41.089
I'm tired. I was on all night.
Let's just call it a day, okay?

38:41.310 --> 38:44.477
- Is this about that rapist?
- You know what this is about.

38:44.689 --> 38:45.933
No, I don't.

38:48.025 --> 38:49.936
Why didn't you use the blood on hand?

38:50.154 --> 38:52.063
- It's all we had.
- So?!

38:52.698 --> 38:54.822
We used six units on that guard.

38:54.993 --> 38:56.950
We were short
and you didn't even blink.

38:57.163 --> 38:59.619
Why not use the blood on the kid?

39:00.167 --> 39:02.658
Autotransfusion was
the best course of action.

39:02.836 --> 39:05.754
Oh, please!
We could've done a thoracotomy.

39:05.965 --> 39:08.421
We could've pumped in blood
on the rapid infuser.

39:08.636 --> 39:10.759
Yeah. Well, he lived.
He's in Recovery.

39:10.972 --> 39:13.048
Dumb luck!

39:13.223 --> 39:17.518
You are one of the most aggressive
physicians I have ever seen in Trauma.

39:17.729 --> 39:19.688
And you autotransfuse him?

39:23.737 --> 39:27.817
You didn't want to waste the blood.
You didn't care if he lived or died.

39:29.203 --> 39:30.662
It's my trauma. It's my call.

39:31.414 --> 39:34.165
Would you do it differently
if he wasn't a rapist?

39:34.375 --> 39:36.285
Come on. Every case is different.

39:36.670 --> 39:38.794
Did you withhold treatment
from that kid?

39:39.007 --> 39:40.799
No.

39:42.887 --> 39:45.175
John, did you withhold treatment?

39:47.893 --> 39:50.135
No.

40:11.589 --> 40:13.629
Fancy meeting you here.

40:15.803 --> 40:17.002
Listen...

40:17.681 --> 40:19.424
...you feel like hitting darts?

40:20.393 --> 40:21.852
Just darts?

40:22.602 --> 40:24.678
Yeah. Just darts.

40:25.106 --> 40:26.602
I mean, if that's okay.

40:28.319 --> 40:30.228
Don't know what you're missing.

40:31.739 --> 40:33.531
I've got a pretty good idea.

40:35.119 --> 40:39.035
As long as I'm not being
unappreciated.

40:42.962 --> 40:45.633
You know, darts usually
involves wagering...

40:45.799 --> 40:49.050
...of a rather substantial nature.

40:49.262 --> 40:52.050
All right. A penny a point.

40:53.684 --> 40:55.678
I'm withdrawing the contract.

40:55.895 --> 40:58.813
I told Anspaugh that Synergix is
no longer interested...

40:59.024 --> 41:00.815
...in managing County's ER.

41:02.320 --> 41:03.483
Why'd you do that?

41:05.616 --> 41:09.863
I only wanted the contract if it meant
working closely with you, Kerry.

41:10.080 --> 41:12.571
Apparently, that's not
possible anymore.

41:14.209 --> 41:16.167
You are a smart...

41:16.338 --> 41:18.497
...beautiful, sexy woman.

41:18.840 --> 41:22.127
I don't want you believing
that I used you, because I didn't.

41:23.846 --> 41:25.757
And I never underestimated you.

41:25.974 --> 41:27.434
Never once.

41:28.519 --> 41:30.311
You underestimate yourself.

41:34.236 --> 41:35.564
Take care.

41:43.454 --> 41:45.827
So you fold under...

41:46.959 --> 41:48.503
...you fold up...

41:49.504 --> 41:51.912
...and you fold over...

41:52.132 --> 41:54.506
...just like that, okay?

41:55.179 --> 41:56.209
Now you try.

41:56.388 --> 41:57.966
Fold up.

41:58.515 --> 42:00.010
Fold over.

42:01.143 --> 42:02.804
That's good. Try it again.

42:10.572 --> 42:12.481
Looks like they're doing great.

42:12.700 --> 42:15.537
Yeah. So why is it so hard for us?

42:15.746 --> 42:17.288
I don't know.

42:21.293 --> 42:23.086
I didn't mean to push.

42:28.637 --> 42:30.630
Take as much time as you need.

42:32.601 --> 42:33.845
I'll wait.

42:58.132 --> 42:59.626
How long you been sitting here?

43:02.263 --> 43:03.721
About an hour...

43:04.683 --> 43:05.761
...give or take.

43:13.027 --> 43:14.818
I wanted him to die.

43:17.156 --> 43:19.612
I saw what he did to that old lady...

43:20.661 --> 43:23.283
...and the others before,
and I wanted him to die.

43:26.668 --> 43:28.910
I didn't think he should
have that blood.

43:31.299 --> 43:35.132
I mean, if somebody'd come in
and they really needed it...

43:35.930 --> 43:39.263
If some little kid had been
hit by a car...

43:39.934 --> 43:41.678
...or some guy had been shot...

43:41.896 --> 43:44.138
...if someone like that had died...

43:44.316 --> 43:46.475
...because we wasted
the blood on that guy...

43:50.281 --> 43:51.692
I don't know.

43:56.706 --> 43:58.248
It was my decision.

44:01.004 --> 44:02.877
And I made it.

44:06.634 --> 44:08.710
If he'd died, I don't know
how I'd feel.

44:14.686 --> 44:17.011
But I can't say that I'm sorry.

44:27.577 --> 44:29.287
I mean, was it wrong?

44:30.123 --> 44:32.081
Anna, are you sure?

44:33.835 --> 44:36.078
No.

44:36.255 --> 44:37.915
I'm not sure.
