<i>You're watching</i>

00:02.937 --> 00:04.436
Yes!

00:04.438 --> 00:05.971
<i>Catch all-new episodes Sundays.</i>

00:05.973 --> 00:08.140

Brooklyn Nine-Nine

00:11.979 --> 00:14.546
-Can me and Ramon
go ride shirtless bikes?
-(sighs)

00:14.548 --> 00:15.748
<i>Only on Fox.</i>

00:16.983 --> 00:18.984
<i>Previously on</i>
The Last Man on Earth...

00:18.986 --> 00:21.687
I just grazed him. I mean,
Pat's gonna be fine. Right?

00:22.889 --> 00:23.822
He dead.

00:23.824 --> 00:25.491
TODD:
<i>Tandy, I killed someone.</i>

00:25.493 --> 00:27.526
Pat is alive.

00:27.528 --> 00:29.528
CAROL: Pat's come for us!
But Tandy will save us.

00:29.530 --> 00:30.996
Pat is dead!

00:30.998 --> 00:32.064
What possible reason do you have

00:32.066 --> 00:33.899
to lie to us like this?

00:33.901 --> 00:36.135
I killed him, didn't I?

00:36.137 --> 00:39.038
That's the nicest thing
anybody's ever done for me.

00:39.040 --> 00:40.172
CAROL:
How'd you get rid of the boat?

00:40.174 --> 00:41.306
Oh, my God.

00:42.842 --> 00:44.410
He gone.

00:45.912 --> 00:47.179
How could Pat be alive?

00:47.181 --> 00:48.680
I mean, I did all the tests.

00:48.682 --> 00:50.015
The breathing test.

00:50.017 --> 00:51.150
The tickling test.

00:51.152 --> 00:52.351
The kicking test.

00:52.353 --> 00:54.653
And all of them came back
positive for death.

00:54.655 --> 00:56.522
Wait, so I-I didn't kill him?

00:56.524 --> 00:57.990
Oh, no, you definitely
killed him.

00:57.992 --> 01:00.059
It's just, he may be alive now.

01:00.061 --> 01:02.027
Tandy, there's a trail of blood
here.

01:02.029 --> 01:04.430
Unless you were fooling around
with your sriracha sauce...

01:04.432 --> 01:07.499
Oh, no, that's blood.
(spits)

01:07.501 --> 01:08.600
It looks like it leads
to the beach.

01:08.602 --> 01:10.903
Look.

01:10.905 --> 01:12.538
(spits)
(gasping)

01:12.540 --> 01:14.907
Look!

01:14.909 --> 01:16.108
(spits)

01:19.212 --> 01:22.614
Well, Pat clearly came down here
to get to his boat.

01:22.616 --> 01:25.117
Okay, we're not safe here.
We need to leave.

01:25.119 --> 01:27.920
What? The boat's gone.
We're safe now.

01:27.922 --> 01:29.354
How do we know
he didn't sail off

01:29.356 --> 01:31.190
to get a bunch
of new killing supplies?

01:31.192 --> 01:33.625
Yeah, maybe he sent the boat off
to make it look like he left,

01:33.627 --> 01:35.461
but he's actually here
in Malibu somewhere.

01:35.463 --> 01:38.597
Hell, that hairy old turd
could be watching us right now.

01:38.599 --> 01:39.631
Oh, my God, there he is!

01:39.633 --> 01:40.699
(all screaming)
Look out!

01:40.701 --> 01:41.533
(Tandy laughing)

01:41.535 --> 01:43.035
Had to do it. BT-- bad timing.

01:43.037 --> 01:44.369
Idiot.

01:44.371 --> 01:46.071
Look, you guys know
that I'm known

01:46.073 --> 01:48.974
for my rational thinking, right?

01:48.976 --> 01:51.376
I'm telling you, we're getting
worked up over nothing here.

01:51.378 --> 01:54.113
Pat lives his life in fear, huh?

01:54.115 --> 01:55.881
And he thinks the virus
is still around.

01:55.883 --> 01:57.049
So, he's not planning

01:57.051 --> 01:58.750
some bloody rampage

01:58.752 --> 02:00.652
where he comes back to stab us
in our hearts,

02:00.654 --> 02:03.088
or to decapitate us
in our sleep,

02:03.090 --> 02:05.224
or to carrot-peel our bodies

02:05.226 --> 02:08.293
and then pour vinegar
on the freshly exposed wounds,

02:08.295 --> 02:11.296
or to, like, you know, rip
into our eyeballs with a razor.

02:11.298 --> 02:13.232
Okay, okay, we get it.
What's your point?

02:13.234 --> 02:16.235
Pat's trying to get as far away
from us as possible.

02:16.237 --> 02:18.303
Okay? Hell, he's probably
already in Hawaii,

02:18.305 --> 02:21.907
toes in the sand,
inking up some jorts.

02:21.909 --> 02:23.275
That's the Pat I know.

02:23.277 --> 02:25.310
(chuckles)
Pat... good guy...

02:25.312 --> 02:26.278
(stammering):
at times.

02:26.280 --> 02:27.479
(Tandy stammering)

02:27.481 --> 02:28.814
Bottom line:

02:28.816 --> 02:31.583
Pat's way more scared of us
than we are of him.

02:31.585 --> 02:33.619
He's not coming back.

02:33.621 --> 02:35.521
No, I got to admit,
I agree with Tandy.

02:35.523 --> 02:37.189
(mouths)
I spent a lot
of time with Pat,

02:37.191 --> 02:39.925
and he really is
a very fearful person.

02:39.927 --> 02:41.226
And he eats cat food.

02:42.695 --> 02:44.263
That doesn't really have
anything to do with anything,

02:44.265 --> 02:45.697
but it was just something weird
that I remember.

02:45.699 --> 02:48.033
But, yeah, I think
he's probably gone.

02:49.102 --> 02:50.969
Thank you, Lewis.
(chuckles)

02:50.971 --> 02:52.704
You knew him best, Lewis.

02:52.706 --> 02:54.673
Maybe we're overthinking this.

02:56.009 --> 02:57.809
Shall we head back to the house?

02:57.811 --> 02:59.111
Yeah, I guess.
I could eat.

02:59.113 --> 03:00.279
Yeah.
Okay.

03:00.281 --> 03:01.847
This is the right move.

03:01.849 --> 03:04.950
We're safe here.

03:16.162 --> 03:17.162
Hey, bud.

03:17.164 --> 03:18.197
What you got there?

03:18.199 --> 03:19.865
Hey, yeah. I, uh...

03:19.867 --> 03:21.400
you know, I know people
are a little uneasy

03:21.402 --> 03:23.035
about the whole
Pat situation,

03:23.037 --> 03:26.805
so I have created
a little makeshift alarm system.

03:26.807 --> 03:29.308
TODD:
(laughs) Neat.

03:29.310 --> 03:30.342
Hey, you want a little taste?

03:30.344 --> 03:31.176
Sure.

03:31.178 --> 03:33.212
Hey, Carol! Come here!

03:33.214 --> 03:35.147
FISH:
♪ Jeremiah was... ♪

03:35.149 --> 03:36.982
♪ Jeremiah was a bullfrog ♪
♪ Jeremiah was a bullfrog ♪

03:36.984 --> 03:39.384
(laughing):
Wow!

03:39.386 --> 03:42.054
Isn't this something!
(gasps)

03:42.056 --> 03:43.188
(laughing)

03:43.190 --> 03:45.924
(overlapping singing continues)

03:45.926 --> 03:47.693
What do you need, Tandy?

03:47.695 --> 03:49.728
Just wanted to tell you
you look wonderful today.

03:49.730 --> 03:52.364
That kind of talk is
grounds for a kiss.

03:52.366 --> 03:54.066
Punishment accepted.

03:54.068 --> 03:55.934
(laughing):
I'm gonna give it to you.

03:55.936 --> 03:57.669
Mmm.
♪ Jeremiah was a bullfrog ♪

03:57.671 --> 03:59.338
♪ Jeremiah was a... ♪

03:59.340 --> 04:01.173

04:11.218 --> 04:13.118

Oh.

04:13.120 --> 04:15.053
Whew!

04:15.055 --> 04:16.355
I'll be in the bedroom.

04:16.357 --> 04:17.923
♪ Jeremiah ♪
♪ Jeremiah ♪

04:17.925 --> 04:22.060
Look, I'm 100% sure
that Pat's not coming back,

04:22.062 --> 04:24.129
but on the one percent chance
he does,

04:24.131 --> 04:26.031
this is a good safeguard,
you know?

04:26.033 --> 04:28.367
And plus, it's a fun song,
so it's a double blessing.

04:28.369 --> 04:29.468
Sure.

04:29.470 --> 04:30.469
Oh, my God, did you notice

04:30.471 --> 04:32.104
how Lewis just totally
got my back

04:32.106 --> 04:33.572
on the whole
staying in Malibu thing?

04:33.574 --> 04:35.140
I did see that.

04:35.142 --> 04:37.809
Oh, it's so nice to see him
coming on over to Tandytown.

04:37.811 --> 04:39.711
Well, let me tell you, I've been
living there for a while,

04:39.713 --> 04:41.413
and the weather is fine.

04:41.415 --> 04:42.414
Yeah, that's 'cause
when you're there,

04:42.416 --> 04:44.416
there's always sunshine.

04:44.418 --> 04:46.251
Let me give you a hand
with these fish, huh?

04:46.253 --> 04:47.886
Hey, why would I need a hand?

04:47.888 --> 04:49.821
I got two of 'em already. Boom.

04:49.823 --> 04:51.523
(laughing):
I'd love your help.

04:55.762 --> 04:56.828
Don't move!

04:56.830 --> 04:57.796
Ah!

04:57.798 --> 04:59.097
Oh, hey, Lewis!

04:59.099 --> 05:00.165
Did I scare you?

05:00.167 --> 05:02.467
Yes, very much so.
(chuckles)

05:02.469 --> 05:04.903
Uh, what is this?

05:04.905 --> 05:06.905
Just a little sniper's nest.

05:06.907 --> 05:08.674
Want to take a gander?

05:08.676 --> 05:10.175
(sighs)

05:10.177 --> 05:12.477
So, this is just your standard
slit trench.

05:12.479 --> 05:14.613
Or as you probably know it,
spider hole.

05:14.615 --> 05:16.682
Sure. Sure. Right.

05:16.684 --> 05:19.785
Uh, this is my primary
vantage point.

05:19.787 --> 05:21.653
What do you think?

05:21.655 --> 05:23.922
Love it. Yeah. Yeah.

05:23.924 --> 05:25.357
Good, uh, vantage point.

05:25.359 --> 05:28.827
Slits seem appropriately...
slitty.

05:28.829 --> 05:31.330
Good trench depth.
Yep. Sure. Sure.

05:31.332 --> 05:33.265
(whispering):
Ooh, there's Erica.

05:33.267 --> 05:37.202
So, let's imagine she's
charging at us with evil intent.

05:37.204 --> 05:39.137
Okay.

05:39.139 --> 05:41.106
(Melissa imitates gunshot)

05:41.108 --> 05:44.042
Brain stem shot.

05:44.044 --> 05:45.477
Brain stem shot?

05:45.479 --> 05:47.879
Base of the brain.
One shot, threat over.

05:47.881 --> 05:51.183
And this nest here gives me, uh,
great brain stem possibilities

05:51.185 --> 05:52.718
from every angle.
Okay.

05:52.720 --> 05:53.719
Here, follow my finger.

05:53.721 --> 05:55.287
All right.

05:55.289 --> 05:56.822
Brain stem shot.

05:56.824 --> 05:58.190
Brain stem
shot.

05:58.192 --> 05:59.391
Brain stem shot.

05:59.393 --> 06:00.559
Brain stem
shot.

06:00.561 --> 06:01.960
Brain stem shot.

06:03.529 --> 06:05.464
Oh. Hey, Erica!

06:05.466 --> 06:06.531
I just shot you.

06:06.533 --> 06:09.067
Oh! Oh, okay.

06:09.069 --> 06:10.068
You were a bad guy.

06:10.070 --> 06:12.204
It was a simulation.
It was fun.

06:12.206 --> 06:14.740
Glad I could, uh, be of help.

06:19.412 --> 06:21.046
(yelling)

06:21.048 --> 06:22.247
(screaming)

06:22.249 --> 06:24.149
Hey-oh!
(laughing)

06:24.151 --> 06:25.350
Couldn't resist.

06:25.352 --> 06:27.352
Got it out of my system.
(laughing)

06:27.354 --> 06:30.355
Just wanted to say, uh, great
first day back at the house.

06:30.357 --> 06:32.824
Uh, a-and by the way,
let's all give Carol a hand

06:32.826 --> 06:34.726
for this amazing redesign. Huh?

06:34.728 --> 06:35.761
Carol.
CAROL:
Oh...

06:35.763 --> 06:37.095
Guys...

06:37.097 --> 06:38.163
Stop it.

06:38.165 --> 06:39.698
You know, it was just a classic

06:39.700 --> 06:41.066
"turn the frown upside down"
deal.

06:41.068 --> 06:42.534
Here, I'll show you.

06:42.536 --> 06:45.270
Oh, so I took all
the bullet holes

06:45.272 --> 06:47.339
and I turned 'em into daisies.

06:47.341 --> 06:49.574
Watch your back, Martha Stewart.
Rest in peace.

06:49.576 --> 06:53.011
And rather than get rid
of all the angry messages,

06:53.013 --> 06:54.379
I thought maybe we should
reclaim them,

06:54.381 --> 06:56.681
like, you know,
how you turn sewage water

06:56.683 --> 06:59.451
into delicious drinking water.

06:59.453 --> 07:01.453
So, instead of,
"We're all going to die,"

07:01.455 --> 07:04.089
I wrote,
"We're all going to diet."

07:04.091 --> 07:05.223
TANDY:
Great idea, Carol. You know,

07:05.225 --> 07:06.725
I've been looking
to shed some LBs,

07:06.727 --> 07:08.960
so, uh, that's gonna serve as
constant motivation.

07:08.962 --> 07:10.896
Yeah, well, I think
you look great, Tandy.

07:10.898 --> 07:12.364
(chuckling):
Thanks, bud.

07:12.366 --> 07:14.032
You got it.
Now, if I may have the floor

07:14.034 --> 07:16.802
for just a few more-- huh,
inadvertent rhyme there--

07:16.804 --> 07:18.236
uh, I've been, y-you know,

07:18.238 --> 07:20.105
thinking about some general
safety measures

07:20.107 --> 07:21.606
that will protect
you treasures--

07:21.608 --> 07:23.408
advertent rhyme.

07:23.410 --> 07:26.411
Okay, um, are we allowed to boo
throughout your little speech,

07:26.413 --> 07:27.979
or do you want us to just
hold all our boos

07:27.981 --> 07:28.980
to the very end?

07:28.982 --> 07:30.081
Yeah, probably at the end.

07:30.083 --> 07:32.250
Okay.
Uh, anyway, to put everyone
at ease,

07:32.252 --> 07:35.320
I've decided to give little
self-defense lessons each night

07:35.322 --> 07:37.656
at dinner.
That's actually not a bad idea,
Tandy.

07:37.658 --> 07:39.724
Thank you, Lewis.

07:39.726 --> 07:41.460
I-I actually need a volunteer.

07:41.462 --> 07:42.894
Would you mind, uh,
helping me out?

07:42.896 --> 07:44.429
Um, sure.

07:44.431 --> 07:45.464
Yeah.

07:45.466 --> 07:46.898
All right.

07:49.402 --> 07:51.002
Now, this is a Taser.

07:51.004 --> 07:52.003
Wait a minute.

07:52.005 --> 07:53.271
Uh...

07:53.273 --> 07:54.940
are you gonna tase me, Tandy?

07:54.942 --> 07:57.075
No, I'm not gonna tase you,
Lewis.

07:57.077 --> 07:59.678
Okay, now just come at me
like you're a murderer. Okay?

08:00.613 --> 08:02.747
(sighs)
Okay. Okay, fine.

08:02.749 --> 08:04.616
Um...

08:04.618 --> 08:06.852
I'm a murderer,
I'm coming for you right now...

08:06.854 --> 08:08.019
Okay, just... Lewis,

08:08.021 --> 08:09.087
come on, what are you, like,

08:09.089 --> 08:10.355
the friendliest murderer
of all time?

08:10.357 --> 08:12.190
Get back there
and act like a murderer.

08:12.192 --> 08:13.758
You want to murder me!
You want to kill me!

08:13.760 --> 08:15.494
I'm nervous that you're gonna
tase me.

08:15.496 --> 08:16.795
Lewis...

08:16.797 --> 08:18.263
trust me.

08:24.470 --> 08:25.670
(yelling)

08:25.672 --> 08:26.972
Okay, so you'd just
press the button...

08:26.974 --> 08:28.273
(Taser buzzing)
Oh!
Tandy!

08:28.275 --> 08:30.275
Oh, no!
Tandy!
Oh, oh, oh, oh...

08:30.277 --> 08:31.543
Oh, oh, oh.
Ooh...

08:31.545 --> 08:33.478
Uh-oh. Still going.
(gasps)

08:33.480 --> 08:34.713
Wait, what do I do?
What do I do?

08:34.715 --> 08:36.214
Try taking your finger
off the button.

08:36.216 --> 08:37.148
(buzzing stops)
Oh.

08:37.150 --> 08:38.283
Oh. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

08:38.285 --> 08:39.484
You just take your finger

08:39.486 --> 08:40.785
off the thing.
Uh, oh...
God...

08:40.787 --> 08:42.020
sorry, bud.

08:42.022 --> 08:43.855
Wow, this thing really works,
huh?

08:43.857 --> 08:45.390
Uh, somebody set a timer

08:45.392 --> 08:47.492
so we can see
how long he's incapacitated.

08:47.494 --> 08:49.027
(quivering)
You okay down there, bud?

08:49.029 --> 08:51.796
(sighs)
Okay, well, good first day.

08:51.798 --> 08:52.964
Why don't we eat?

08:52.966 --> 08:55.166
He can join in progress, right?

08:55.168 --> 08:56.635
(quivering)

08:58.638 --> 08:59.871
TANDY:
Hey.

08:59.873 --> 09:02.073
Oh, Tandy. Hi.

09:02.075 --> 09:04.309
Take a look at this, huh?

09:04.311 --> 09:06.978
What do you think?

09:06.980 --> 09:08.880
I love it! What is it?

09:08.882 --> 09:10.682
Oh, here, get on all fours
and I'll show you.

09:10.684 --> 09:12.918
All right.
Okay.

09:12.920 --> 09:14.085
I trust you, here.

09:14.087 --> 09:15.487
There's some point to this,
sure.

09:15.489 --> 09:18.523
This is so if anyone comes
into the house,

09:18.525 --> 09:22.661
they will be unable to locate
and murder the cow.

09:22.663 --> 09:25.096
Wow.
I call it "cow-moo-flage."

09:25.098 --> 09:26.765
(both laughing)

09:26.767 --> 09:28.567
I love it.
You could open a store.

09:28.569 --> 09:30.035
I'd like to.

09:30.037 --> 09:31.536
Hey, Carol?

09:31.538 --> 09:32.604
You don't think that Lewis
was upset

09:32.606 --> 09:34.372
that I tased him, do you?

09:34.374 --> 09:37.509
No, I think he understood where
from which you were coming.

09:37.511 --> 09:40.245
You sure? 'Cause I noticed
a look when I zotzed him.

09:40.247 --> 09:43.014
That might have just been
his body seizing.

09:43.016 --> 09:45.684
I-I just really regret the way
that I treated him.

09:45.686 --> 09:47.586
And, uh, I don't know...

09:47.588 --> 09:50.889
just hope that one day,
we can, you know...

09:50.891 --> 09:53.558
You want to be his friend?

09:53.560 --> 09:54.960
Yeah.

09:54.962 --> 09:56.294
Well, your heart's
in the right place.

09:56.296 --> 09:58.063
Why don't you just ask him?

09:58.065 --> 09:59.864
I'm so bad at these things.

09:59.866 --> 10:02.734
You just speak
from your heartmouth

10:02.736 --> 10:04.235
and you can't miss.

10:04.237 --> 10:06.938
I'll do that.

10:06.940 --> 10:09.207
♪ Jeremiah was a bullfrog ♪
Oh, God, do you think
that's Pat?

10:09.209 --> 10:10.875
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.
Just follow me.

10:10.877 --> 10:12.777
♪ Was a good friend of mine ♪

10:12.779 --> 10:15.080
♪ Jeremiah was a bullfrog ♪

10:15.082 --> 10:16.548

10:16.550 --> 10:19.618

10:19.620 --> 10:22.621
♪ Never understood

10:22.623 --> 10:26.558

10:26.560 --> 10:27.792
(screaming)

10:27.794 --> 10:28.793
(all screaming)

10:28.795 --> 10:30.128
Oh!
Oh!

10:30.130 --> 10:32.564
Erica, you put the fear of gosh
in us!

10:32.566 --> 10:34.666
Geez, guys, cool your jets.

10:34.668 --> 10:36.568
I just had a bout
of morning sickness.

10:36.570 --> 10:39.337
(gags) Oh, don't say
"morning sickness."

10:39.339 --> 10:42.774
(gagging):
Oh, now I've got it.

10:42.776 --> 10:44.476
<i>Obviously,</i>

10:44.478 --> 10:47.112
we need to do a better job
at figuring out who

10:47.114 --> 10:49.447
is setting off
our singing wall fishes.

10:49.449 --> 10:51.149
Tap shoes?

10:51.151 --> 10:52.751
And there's whistles
in there, too.

10:52.753 --> 10:55.086
So, I propose
that when we walk around,

10:55.088 --> 10:57.355
we wear these tappers
and we blow these whistles.

10:57.357 --> 10:59.924
That way, when we hear
our singing wall fish,

10:59.926 --> 11:01.326
but we don't hear this...

11:01.328 --> 11:02.861
(whistle blowing)

11:02.863 --> 11:04.763
(shoes tapping)

11:04.765 --> 11:07.532
(whistle blowing,
shoes tapping)

11:07.534 --> 11:10.468
...we'll know it's someone
that needs to be terminated.

11:10.470 --> 11:12.671
Okay. Well, I'm with you
in theory.

11:12.673 --> 11:14.372
But I guess my only
problem is that

11:14.374 --> 11:16.174
I'm not gonna wear
those frigging things,

11:16.176 --> 11:17.709
and y'all can suck it.

11:17.711 --> 11:19.210
So, a maybe from Gail.

11:19.212 --> 11:21.680
Okay, now, before
you leave, FYI,

11:21.682 --> 11:24.049
I got a few extra Tasers
and I placed them

11:24.051 --> 11:26.217
at what I like to call
"tasing stations"

11:26.219 --> 11:27.485
throughout the house.

11:27.487 --> 11:28.520
Th-They're all very well marked

11:28.522 --> 11:30.722
with these signs
that, uh, Carol made.

11:30.724 --> 11:33.024
I'm doing something similar,
but with axes.

11:33.026 --> 11:34.392
Uh, I didn't

11:34.394 --> 11:36.194
put up any signs or anything,
but it's...

11:36.196 --> 11:38.830
basically just a bunch of axes
around the house--

11:38.832 --> 11:40.398
pretty self-explanatory.

11:40.400 --> 11:42.333
There's one over here.

11:42.335 --> 11:45.236
So, what you do is you just
take the ax,

11:45.238 --> 11:47.172
swing it through the person.

11:47.174 --> 11:50.942
And then wipe off the blood
and put it back in its station.

11:58.551 --> 12:00.185
Speak from the heartmouth.

12:00.187 --> 12:03.054
Speak
from the heartmouth.

12:03.056 --> 12:04.723
Oh, hey, Lewis!

12:04.725 --> 12:06.224
Thank you so much
for joining me here.

12:06.226 --> 12:08.727
Uh, I'll get straight
to the point.

12:08.729 --> 12:12.030
Uh, you ever heard the story
of the lion and the mouse?

12:12.032 --> 12:15.033
Uh, yeah. I think so.
It's been a long time.

12:15.035 --> 12:17.035
Okay, well, then, why don't I
give you a little refresher.

12:17.037 --> 12:18.737
So, there was this fierce lion,

12:18.739 --> 12:20.405
he lived
in a beautiful savannah.

12:20.407 --> 12:22.440
He had many brothers
and sisters--

12:22.442 --> 12:24.275
he was the middle lion of 11.

12:24.277 --> 12:26.177
Uh, Freddy was
his oldest sibling,

12:26.179 --> 12:27.779
then came Robert,

12:27.781 --> 12:30.281
and then Lewis, then Taylor...

12:30.283 --> 12:32.884
Hey, Todd. I've been
thinking and I'm...
Shh...

12:32.886 --> 12:35.420
Tandy's asking Lewis
to be his friend.

12:37.289 --> 12:39.791
Oh, Lord. Everyone's crazy.

12:39.793 --> 12:41.025
...and then there was Tabitha,

12:41.027 --> 12:42.293
and then Glendon,

12:42.295 --> 12:44.062
and the youngest sibling
was called Mouse.

12:44.064 --> 12:46.297
A weird name for a lion,
and also a little confusing

12:46.299 --> 12:49.267
as an actual mouse figures
prominently into this story.

12:49.269 --> 12:51.469
Anyway, this mouse--
not the lion named Mouse,

12:51.471 --> 12:53.938
but the actual mouse--
was an only child,

12:53.940 --> 12:56.975
but married
into a very large family.

12:56.977 --> 13:00.545
His name was Tetracles
and his wife was Patricia. Now,

13:00.547 --> 13:03.481
Patricia was one of
21 mouse children.

13:03.483 --> 13:06.985
Their names, by height,
were Debra, Daniel, Dorothy--

13:06.987 --> 13:08.753
all Ds-- Dominic...

13:08.755 --> 13:10.155
What's going on?

13:10.157 --> 13:12.290
I have no idea why
I'm watching this,

13:12.292 --> 13:15.827
but apparently Tandy is asking
Lewis to be his little buddy.

13:15.829 --> 13:19.130
Oh, my word,
it's happening!

13:19.132 --> 13:20.799
And then their mother,
she had a brother Terry,

13:20.801 --> 13:22.400
who, uh, died shortly
after mousebirth.

13:22.402 --> 13:25.303
Anyway, so this story has
something to do with, you know,

13:25.305 --> 13:27.505
this mouse and this lion,

13:27.507 --> 13:29.007
and, you know, there's, like,

13:29.009 --> 13:31.509
a-a thorn in a foot. Right?

13:31.511 --> 13:33.011
Uh, long story short...

13:33.013 --> 13:36.681
Lewis, will you be my friend?

13:36.683 --> 13:39.150
Uh...

13:39.152 --> 13:40.351
fine. Yeah.

13:40.353 --> 13:43.154
Yes? Really?

13:44.156 --> 13:45.857
(imitates explosion)

13:45.859 --> 13:47.025
(gasps)
He said yes!

13:47.027 --> 13:48.459
(squealing):
He said yes!

13:48.461 --> 13:50.628
Hey, bud, so you want to, uh,
chuck around the pigskin?

13:50.630 --> 13:51.963
LEWIS: All right.
TANDY: Go out.

13:51.965 --> 13:53.364
What are we doing?

13:53.366 --> 13:55.834
Ah, nothing. Tandy and Lewis
just became friends.

13:55.836 --> 13:57.368
You know, I gave it my blessing.
Whatever.

13:57.370 --> 13:58.803
Wait, down on the beach?
Yeah.

13:58.805 --> 14:01.039
Hey! No!
(whistle blowing)

14:01.041 --> 14:02.040
Oh, back to pass.

14:02.042 --> 14:04.042
Oh, little high.

14:04.044 --> 14:06.411
Oh!

14:08.380 --> 14:11.382
Okay, so I think that most of us
are aware by now,

14:11.384 --> 14:13.785
but, uh, Melissa has
planted a series of land mines

14:13.787 --> 14:14.886
down here on the beach.

14:14.888 --> 14:16.554
Yeah. That's normal.

14:16.556 --> 14:18.022
I put up a warning.

14:18.024 --> 14:19.424
Oh...

14:20.492 --> 14:21.993
it was in my pocket.

14:21.995 --> 14:25.063
So, basically, I just decided
to make the beach

14:25.065 --> 14:27.832
less of a hangout area
and more of a protection zone.

14:27.834 --> 14:29.567
So, there's a bunch over there.

14:29.569 --> 14:30.969
A bunch over there.

14:30.971 --> 14:32.403
That area has a few.

14:32.405 --> 14:34.005
And then that area
is loaded.

14:34.007 --> 14:36.140
So... bunch, bunch, few, loaded.

14:36.142 --> 14:37.375
Got it. Everybody got it?

14:37.377 --> 14:40.578
Okay, this has gone on
long enough.

14:40.580 --> 14:41.880
Well, I think everyone
should know

14:41.882 --> 14:43.414
where the land mines are, right?

14:43.416 --> 14:45.750
No. I mean, what are we still
doing here?

14:45.752 --> 14:47.018
Okay, well, now I'm lost.

14:47.020 --> 14:48.253
(stammering): We're down here
on the beach,

14:48.255 --> 14:49.754
talking about where
the land mines are.

14:49.756 --> 14:51.089
LEWIS:
No. I am saying,

14:51.091 --> 14:53.992
why are we staying here?

14:53.994 --> 14:57.161
This beach is littered
with land mines,

14:57.163 --> 14:59.597
a madman knows exactly
where we are,

14:59.599 --> 15:02.166
this house is
a complete disaster,

15:02.168 --> 15:04.669
and those fish... that song...

15:04.671 --> 15:06.704
I mean, what
are we doing?

15:06.706 --> 15:08.573
We need to get out of here.
This place is a nightmare!

15:08.575 --> 15:09.674
Nightmare?

15:09.676 --> 15:12.577
If anything, this place is
a day-stallion!

15:12.579 --> 15:17.282
Okay, but we can live literally
anywhere in the world.

15:17.284 --> 15:19.384
Lewis, it might be easy
for you to just pack up

15:19.386 --> 15:22.120
and leave, 'cause you just
got here, like, five days ago.

15:22.122 --> 15:24.088
But we've been here
for a long time.

15:24.090 --> 15:26.357
This place is part of
who we are, you know?

15:26.359 --> 15:28.026
This is our home.

15:29.795 --> 15:32.864
We've laughed here.
We've cried here.

15:32.866 --> 15:34.299
We've fallen in love,

15:34.301 --> 15:37.201
we've experienced the miracle
of life...

15:38.637 --> 15:41.105
...and the pain of sickness.
You know?

15:41.107 --> 15:42.106
We've buried friends.

15:42.108 --> 15:44.442
And somehow,

15:44.444 --> 15:47.679
against all odds,
we became a family here.

15:49.581 --> 15:51.716
It's gonna take a lot more than
a couple friggin' land mines

15:51.718 --> 15:53.785
to make us leave it.

15:56.322 --> 15:59.023
I would avoid that area.

16:02.661 --> 16:04.362
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

16:08.167 --> 16:09.267
It's nothing.

16:09.269 --> 16:11.135
(fork clatters)
(screaming)

16:11.137 --> 16:13.004
Sorry.
Oh, geez.

16:13.006 --> 16:14.806
I'm gonna turn in.

16:17.843 --> 16:22.347
(shoes tapping, whistle blowing)

16:29.855 --> 16:31.923
(sighs)

16:38.097 --> 16:40.264
(explosion)
(gasping): Tandy!

16:40.266 --> 16:42.266
(explosion)
Oh, my God!

16:42.268 --> 16:44.302
(car alarm blaring)

16:44.304 --> 16:48.272
(whistle blowing)
(echoing):
♪ Jeremiah was a bullfrog ♪

16:48.274 --> 16:51.943
♪ Was a good friend of mine ♪

16:51.945 --> 16:53.211
♪ Never understood... ♪

16:53.213 --> 16:54.979
(car alarm blaring)
What is happening?!

16:54.981 --> 16:55.880
It's got to be Pat!

16:55.882 --> 16:57.782
Oh, relax, it's not Pat!

16:57.784 --> 16:59.951
Then who the hell is
setting off those land mines?!

16:59.953 --> 17:00.785
I don't know!

17:00.787 --> 17:01.953
What are we gonna do?

17:01.955 --> 17:03.654
(automatic gunfire)
(screaming)

17:03.656 --> 17:05.356
Hey!
(screaming)

17:05.358 --> 17:07.191
(yelling)

17:07.193 --> 17:08.559
No!

17:08.561 --> 17:10.128
What are you doing?!

17:10.130 --> 17:11.496
I don't know anymore!

17:11.498 --> 17:12.997
(automatic gunfire)

17:12.999 --> 17:14.565
Who is shooting at us?

17:14.567 --> 17:17.001
It's Melissa!
She's not shooting at us!

17:17.003 --> 17:18.536
Then who is she shooting at?

17:18.538 --> 17:21.172
She doesn't know!
She's shooting at random!

17:21.174 --> 17:22.540
(screaming)

17:22.542 --> 17:24.809
Oh, my God, we're all gonna die,

17:24.811 --> 17:26.210
aren't we?
LEWIS:
Listen!

17:26.212 --> 17:29.380
The tide came in,
it triggered the land mines,

17:29.382 --> 17:31.416
the vibrations
from the land mines

17:31.418 --> 17:34.152
triggered the car alarms!
That's all!

17:34.154 --> 17:36.888
Okay, see?
I told you we're fine!

17:36.890 --> 17:39.557
So, let's all just go back
and get some sleep!

17:39.559 --> 17:41.359
(explosions, automatic gunfire)

17:41.361 --> 17:42.927
(screaming)
MELISSA:
My bad!

17:42.929 --> 17:44.362
I was laying
some blanket fire,

17:44.364 --> 17:45.663
and one got away from me.

17:45.665 --> 17:48.533
I can't live like this anymore!

17:48.535 --> 17:50.835
Look, admittedly,
we're working out the kinks.

17:50.837 --> 17:52.703
But we'll get a handle on this!

17:52.705 --> 17:54.238
No, I'm with Gail!
It is not worth it!

17:54.240 --> 17:56.941
Tandy, this is no way
to live, man!

17:56.943 --> 18:00.111
Guys, come on! There's nothing
to fear but fear itself!

18:00.113 --> 18:01.779
Did we learn nothing
from Tony Robbins?

18:01.781 --> 18:03.047
LEWIS:
All right!

18:03.049 --> 18:04.415
I'm leaving tomorrow!

18:04.417 --> 18:06.451
Anyone who wants is welcome
to join me.

18:06.453 --> 18:07.518
Count me in.

18:07.520 --> 18:08.886
Me, too!
I'll go with you!

18:08.888 --> 18:10.588
Tandy, we should go with them.

18:10.590 --> 18:12.256
We can't just give up!

18:12.258 --> 18:14.292
This is our home!

18:15.260 --> 18:17.061
Tandy...

18:17.063 --> 18:19.263
we're friends, right?

18:20.899 --> 18:22.700
You know that story
you were telling me

18:22.702 --> 18:25.369
about the lion and the mouse?

18:25.371 --> 18:28.639
Well, it ends with the mouse
pulling the thorn

18:28.641 --> 18:30.274
out of the lion's foot.

18:31.877 --> 18:34.745
I know you have
a lot of memories here,

18:34.747 --> 18:37.381
but I think maybe it's time

18:37.383 --> 18:40.485
to pull the thorn
out of the foot.

18:47.159 --> 18:48.159
