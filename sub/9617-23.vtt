00:00.134 --> 00:02.835
♪♪

00:10.711 --> 00:13.779
All through history,
countries go to war.

00:13.781 --> 00:15.547
That's what we normally
study in here.

00:15.549 --> 00:18.884
But today,
we're going to talk
about peace and forgiveness

00:18.886 --> 00:20.953
And how we get there.

00:20.955 --> 00:23.455
Every once in a while,
I come up with a good idea.

00:23.457 --> 00:26.458
What could it possibly be
that I haven't already
thought of?

00:26.460 --> 00:28.394
Farkle, I forgive you.

00:28.396 --> 00:30.696
-What did I do?
-I forgive you too.

00:30.698 --> 00:34.299
-What did I do?
-You know what you do.

00:34.301 --> 00:37.136
I feel better
now that I've forgiven you.
How do you feel?

00:37.138 --> 00:39.805
I'm sorry for every time
I've hurt you!
What did I do?

00:39.807 --> 00:44.143
Ladies and gentlemen,
today we're going to begin
the forgiveness project.

00:44.145 --> 00:46.879
Our history isn't just
about what we've done.

00:46.881 --> 00:49.715
How we grow
comes from the repair
of what we've done

00:49.717 --> 00:52.484
And how we forgive
what was done to us.

00:52.486 --> 00:54.820
Hmm. We're in.
What do we do?

00:54.822 --> 00:56.989
Everyone take out
a piece of paper.

00:56.991 --> 00:59.992
So this isn't your laptop
or your cell phone.

00:59.994 --> 01:03.028
You've got
unlimited characters here.

01:03.030 --> 01:04.730
As many words as you want.

01:04.732 --> 01:07.399
The impact will last longer
than six seconds.

01:07.401 --> 01:10.169
And I guarantee you,
it's never going to disappear.

01:10.171 --> 01:14.339
So pick up a pen.
Express feelings.

01:14.341 --> 01:17.042
This is one of
the most important things
you're ever going to do.

01:17.044 --> 01:19.011
You're about
to forgive someone.

01:19.013 --> 01:20.779
What's this got to do
with history, matthews?

01:20.781 --> 01:22.114
It gives you a chance
to change it.

01:22.116 --> 01:24.783
Like when I forgave auggie
for biting the face

01:24.785 --> 01:27.119
Off my beary-the-bear bear.

01:27.121 --> 01:29.354
That wasn't forgiveness,
honey.

01:29.356 --> 01:32.291
-Why not?
-Because you haven't
gotten over it.

01:32.293 --> 01:36.495
This is the first thing
I see every day.

01:37.765 --> 01:40.432
So is there anyone
in your life

01:40.434 --> 01:44.269
That you want to forgive?
Change your history. Go.

01:46.807 --> 01:49.942
"dear auggie
the murderer..."

01:51.445 --> 01:55.047
Maya, no one in your life
you want to forgive?

01:55.049 --> 01:57.049
No.

01:57.051 --> 02:00.018
Don't you think now
would be a good time?

02:01.589 --> 02:04.056
You and your mom
are in a good place.

02:04.058 --> 02:05.891
You're strong, maya.

02:05.893 --> 02:08.627
Don't you want to forgive him
one day? Why not now?

02:10.564 --> 02:12.798
Hmm.

02:13.934 --> 02:16.635
-(maya laughs)
-(chuckling)

02:21.108 --> 02:22.774
Ahem.

02:22.776 --> 02:25.177
"riley,

02:25.179 --> 02:26.812
"butt out.

02:28.449 --> 02:31.216
"I am serious.
Butt your butt out."

02:32.520 --> 02:34.319
I forgive you.

You know, you try
to do your best by people.

03:37.818 --> 03:39.518
You try to be
the best friend you could be.

03:39.520 --> 03:41.653
And what do you get?

03:41.655 --> 03:44.990
-What did I do?
-Read 'em.

03:44.992 --> 03:46.658
"dear farkle,
I forgive you

03:46.660 --> 03:48.827
"for ruining every single movie
we've ever seen together."

03:48.829 --> 03:50.095
How do I ruin
every single movie?

03:50.097 --> 03:53.832
Ah, read mine.
Read mine.

03:53.834 --> 03:57.736
"I forgive you for figuring out
the end of every movie

03:57.738 --> 03:59.504
"and shouting it out
before it happens."

03:59.506 --> 04:02.241
Because, see,
we don't want to know.

04:02.243 --> 04:04.009
I just want to share
my abilities with my friends.

04:04.011 --> 04:05.844
We don't want
your abilities.

04:05.846 --> 04:08.413
Your abilities make us
want to hurt you.

04:08.415 --> 04:10.382
Riley, maya,
movie with me?

04:10.384 --> 04:12.050
-Are you crazy?
-Never again.

04:12.052 --> 04:13.685
-"she dies!"
-"he blows up!"

04:13.687 --> 04:15.721
-"she's the killer."
-"nobody gets out of
monkey town."

04:15.723 --> 04:19.291
-Are you crazy?
-Hurt you.

04:19.293 --> 04:21.059
Well, thank you
for forgiving me.

04:21.061 --> 04:22.761
Do you think we could
still go to the movies

04:22.763 --> 04:24.363
If I stop telling you
what happens next?

04:24.365 --> 04:25.697
Do you think you can?

04:25.699 --> 04:28.433
Of course I can.
"oh, let's give him
one more chance."

04:28.435 --> 04:31.036
"hey!" then you chase me,
and then I scream.

04:31.038 --> 04:33.872
-Let's give him
one more chance.
-Hey!

04:33.874 --> 04:37.309
It's just too much fun! Ahh!

04:41.548 --> 04:43.949
Go on, open it.

04:43.951 --> 04:46.385
Read it. Go on.
Open it, read it, go on!

04:46.387 --> 04:48.053
Open it, read it.

04:49.556 --> 04:51.189
I'll read it.

04:52.393 --> 04:54.059
"dear August,

04:54.061 --> 04:56.995
"remember when
you bit the face off
of my beary-the-bear bear?

04:56.997 --> 04:59.464
"well, I forgive you."

04:59.466 --> 05:02.834
Ha! Now what are going to do?

05:02.836 --> 05:06.071
Didn't I do that
when I was, like,
three years old?

05:06.073 --> 05:08.940
Well, now I forgive you.
Your move.

05:08.942 --> 05:12.944
Don't you think
a normal person would have
gotten over this by now?

05:12.946 --> 05:15.747
Auggie, this isn't about me.

05:15.749 --> 05:18.483
This is about you
thanking me for
forgiving you.

05:18.485 --> 05:20.919
So thank me.

05:20.921 --> 05:24.856
What is the matter with you?

05:26.327 --> 05:29.094
This is the matter with me.

05:29.096 --> 05:31.463
It doesn't sound like
you're trying to forgive me.

05:31.465 --> 05:33.765
It sounds like
you just want me to be sorry.

05:33.767 --> 05:35.167
You should be.

05:35.169 --> 05:37.369
Well, I'm not, riley.
So do you still forgive me

05:37.371 --> 05:39.204
For something
I'm not sorry for?

05:39.206 --> 05:41.306
Forgive you
with no return apology?

05:41.308 --> 05:43.775
No, I do not.

05:43.777 --> 05:45.777
Then good day.

05:47.281 --> 05:49.848
Good day to you,
unforgiven.

05:49.850 --> 05:53.352
Good day to you... Not!

05:58.959 --> 06:01.960
Really, topanga,
please don't worry about this.

06:01.962 --> 06:03.362
No, I told you
that I would come

06:03.364 --> 06:05.530
And help out when I can,
and I can today.

06:05.532 --> 06:07.632
Yeah. No.

06:07.634 --> 06:09.634
This is gonna be good.

06:09.636 --> 06:11.136
I can't take my eyes off it.

06:11.138 --> 06:13.004
You don't think
I can do this, do you?

06:13.006 --> 06:15.173
I think that
you are topanga matthews,

06:15.175 --> 06:18.577
Attorney at law,
and that might perhaps

06:18.579 --> 06:20.979
Color the way
that you deal with customers,

06:20.981 --> 06:23.348
Who I don't even
think will believe
that you're a waitress.

06:23.350 --> 06:26.385
I could be a fine waitress.

06:29.189 --> 06:31.022
And what will you have, sir?

06:31.024 --> 06:32.457
Yeah, give me the cheesecake.

06:34.695 --> 06:36.828
You want to try that
a different way, chief?

06:36.830 --> 06:39.998
-No!
-Okay. Hey, howie.

06:40.000 --> 06:42.334
Oh, there you go.

06:42.336 --> 06:44.503
You know what comes
with our biggest piece
of cheesecake?

06:44.505 --> 06:46.171
Our biggest smile.

06:46.173 --> 06:47.873
Ha! Don't ever leave me again.

06:47.875 --> 06:50.909
-Aw, thanks, howie.
-I was talking to
the cheesecake.

06:52.179 --> 06:53.512
Okay, one more.

06:53.514 --> 06:55.680
-No more ever.
-No.

06:55.682 --> 06:57.516
I'm gonna try that guy,
right over there.

06:59.520 --> 07:00.852
No, I got him.

07:00.854 --> 07:03.688
Okay.
I'll learn from you.

07:07.127 --> 07:10.562
You're going to want
to watch what happens next
very carefully.

07:10.564 --> 07:14.900
Why?
Your mother's great at this,
maya. What could happen?

07:14.902 --> 07:17.035
Hello, sir.
How are you today?

07:17.037 --> 07:18.637
-You a little hungry, are you?
-I'm--

07:18.639 --> 07:20.739
Is that why you've come here?
Are you a little hungry?

07:20.741 --> 07:23.208
-Is that--
-what do you recommend?

07:23.210 --> 07:25.210
I recommend the first thing
that I can get my hands on.

07:25.212 --> 07:26.878
-Give me something.
-Okay.

07:26.880 --> 07:29.881
You should have said please!

07:29.883 --> 07:32.050
-That's what I recommend!
-(topanga gasping)

07:35.389 --> 07:37.622
You can do that?

07:37.624 --> 07:39.391
I didn't know
you could do that.

07:39.393 --> 07:42.561
I would love to do that.

07:43.730 --> 07:45.764
Oh, my gosh.
Is that him?

07:45.766 --> 07:48.600
Is he him?
Did you do it?
Did you do the assignment?

07:48.602 --> 07:50.569
I wrote something,
and I mailed it.

07:50.571 --> 07:52.404
-Tell me it was a good move.
-It was a bad move.

07:52.406 --> 07:54.406
-Why?
-Tried it. It doesn't work.

07:54.408 --> 07:57.075
They don't apologize.
Forgiveness is for jerks.

07:57.077 --> 07:59.578
I'm glad you told me in time.

07:59.580 --> 08:01.079
Oh, I don't understand.

08:01.081 --> 08:03.582
Is this guy
our millionth customer?

08:03.584 --> 08:06.485
-No!
-Sir, why are you okay
with this?

08:06.487 --> 08:08.420
I kind of expected it.

08:08.422 --> 08:11.990
Katy, who is this guy?

08:23.337 --> 08:25.770
Hi, maya.

08:27.107 --> 08:28.840
Hi, dad.

08:38.118 --> 08:39.284
Hi.

08:39.286 --> 08:41.286
I'm riley.

08:41.288 --> 08:42.954
I've heard a lot
about you.

08:42.956 --> 08:45.724
Hi, riley.
You a good friend of maya's?

08:45.726 --> 08:48.693
I'm sorry,
and please don't take this
the wrong way,

08:48.695 --> 08:50.362
But what?

08:50.364 --> 08:52.664
Riley is my best friend.

08:52.666 --> 08:55.667
But you wouldn't know
much about her.

08:55.669 --> 08:57.702
Or me.

08:57.704 --> 09:00.472
Thank you for being
maya's best friend.

09:00.474 --> 09:03.141
It's easy
because maya's great.

09:03.143 --> 09:04.809
She's the best person
I know.

09:04.811 --> 09:06.978
Then I'm happy
she found you.

09:06.980 --> 09:10.882
I was picturing a monster.
He doesn't seem like
a monster.

09:10.884 --> 09:15.053
He seems like frosty
the snow-guy.

09:16.223 --> 09:18.423
What are you doing here,
kermit?

09:18.425 --> 09:20.992
I was invited.

09:20.994 --> 09:23.194
What?

09:23.196 --> 09:26.431
This is all my dad's fault.

09:26.433 --> 09:28.433
-Your father had an idea?
-Uh-huh.

09:28.435 --> 09:31.536
I apologize immediately.
Your food is on the house.

09:31.538 --> 09:35.206
That's very nice of you
because I wouldn't have been
able to afford all of this.

09:35.208 --> 09:37.943
May I please borrow a towel
and your sink?

09:37.945 --> 09:40.512
And I'll take this to go.

09:51.258 --> 09:55.460
You said you were
going out for a walk
and you'd be back in an hour.

09:55.462 --> 09:57.028
You're nine years late.

09:57.030 --> 10:00.198
-Thank you, katy.
-For what?

10:00.200 --> 10:03.368
I know that
in those nine years,
you protected me with maya.

10:03.370 --> 10:05.203
You never once
sold me out.

10:05.205 --> 10:08.206
Yeah, well, a girl
should think well
of her father.

10:09.476 --> 10:11.476
I was real happy
to get your letter, maya.

10:11.478 --> 10:13.211
And that you've got
a friend like riley.

10:13.213 --> 10:15.547
This girl here
is more of a father to me
than you.

10:15.549 --> 10:18.717
Yeah, I raised maya
since she was a pup.

10:18.719 --> 10:20.652
Looks like
you did a bang-up job.

10:20.654 --> 10:23.989
So... You left.

10:23.991 --> 10:26.625
Why were mom and I
not good enough?

10:26.627 --> 10:28.426
No, no, no.
Maya.

10:28.428 --> 10:30.629
That was a long time ago.
We're over it.

10:30.631 --> 10:32.230
Why were we not good enough?

10:32.232 --> 10:35.300
Ah! I think you know
that wasn't it.

10:36.637 --> 10:39.638
Ha. You know,

10:39.640 --> 10:42.841
I should really go
anywhere but here.

10:42.843 --> 10:45.143
Nope, you're gonna
stay with me.

10:45.145 --> 10:47.145
You're my family.

10:47.147 --> 10:49.514
Oh, how's your other family?

10:49.516 --> 10:52.450
Everyone is fine.

10:52.452 --> 10:54.452
Riley, do you care
to explain to me

10:54.454 --> 10:56.154
Your father's idea here?

10:56.156 --> 10:57.856
Our assignment
was to forgive somebody.

10:57.858 --> 11:00.325
-What does that have to do--
-it changes our history.

11:00.327 --> 11:03.595
Oh.
That's pretty good.

11:03.597 --> 11:06.431
So maya wrote to him
and he showed up.

11:06.433 --> 11:07.599
To forgive him?

11:07.601 --> 11:09.534
Yeah, that was
the assignment.

11:09.536 --> 11:13.438
But I haven't decided
if I'm going to pass
or fail.

11:13.440 --> 11:15.940
Maya, whatever you decide,

11:15.942 --> 11:17.942
Thank you
for reaching out to me.

11:17.944 --> 11:20.278
You know, this would be
so much easier for me

11:20.280 --> 11:22.347
If he was a monster.

11:25.686 --> 11:29.120
Do you remember
that night the thunder
shook the apartment?

11:29.122 --> 11:31.122
I was five
and I thought--

11:31.124 --> 11:33.625
The lightning
was so bright, I thought
the world was on fire.

11:33.627 --> 11:35.560
Why bring this up?

11:35.562 --> 11:38.563
I'm all under my covers
crying and you come flying
into the room

11:38.565 --> 11:41.332
And peek under the covers
and decide to make it a game.

11:41.334 --> 11:44.169
We were in alaska
looking for gold.

11:44.171 --> 11:47.038
And you said the lightning
was the northern lights.

11:47.040 --> 11:48.707
The aurora borealis.

11:48.709 --> 11:53.178
Is this the reason
the only thing you know
is the aurora borealis?

11:53.180 --> 11:57.182
You made that entire night
an adventure

11:57.184 --> 11:59.017
Until the storm passed.

11:59.019 --> 12:01.319
And I woke up
the next morning

12:01.321 --> 12:04.823
And it was a sunny day.
Don't you remember that?

12:04.825 --> 12:07.692
No, maya, I don't.

12:07.694 --> 12:09.994
That's because
it never happened.

12:09.996 --> 12:12.030
The storm happened

12:12.032 --> 12:14.165
But you didn't.

12:16.269 --> 12:20.071
So how do you know
the aurora borealis, maya?

12:20.073 --> 12:22.240
Mom.

12:22.242 --> 12:24.342
It was mom that came in.

12:24.344 --> 12:27.345
She made it alaska
and I wasn't scared at all.

12:27.347 --> 12:29.881
Hmm. I was petrified.

12:29.883 --> 12:32.283
Greatest performance
of my life.

12:32.285 --> 12:33.685
Where were you?

12:33.687 --> 12:36.521
I wasn't home.

12:36.523 --> 12:38.690
How could you not be home?

12:38.692 --> 12:41.192
Because kids bite
teddy bears' faces off,

12:41.194 --> 12:44.262
Friends ruin movies
and fathers leave.

12:44.264 --> 12:47.599
You know, sometimes
you can let it go,
sometimes you can't.

12:47.601 --> 12:51.035
Your dad was wrong
about this one, riley.

12:52.439 --> 12:54.305
-Riley.
-Yeah.

12:59.312 --> 13:01.212
How's the forgiveness
project going?

13:01.214 --> 13:03.414
-You killed us, matthews.
-I gotta say, matthews,

13:03.416 --> 13:05.083
I don't know
what you were thinking.

13:05.085 --> 13:07.452
You think forgiveness
leads to peace?

13:07.454 --> 13:09.053
It leads to war
in a movie theater.

13:09.055 --> 13:11.556
Lights go down,
the movie starts,

13:11.558 --> 13:13.892
I make farkle sit
in the other corner
of the theater

13:13.894 --> 13:16.895
-So he can't ruin anything.
-Sounds like good strategy.

13:16.897 --> 13:18.897
Yeah. Then a cowboy
comes on the screen.

13:18.899 --> 13:20.999
-Farkle yells--
-"dead!"

13:21.001 --> 13:23.568
-An old prospector
comes on the screen.
-"alien

13:23.570 --> 13:25.170
"looking for a time portal."

13:25.172 --> 13:27.172
Next comes a cheerleader.

13:27.174 --> 13:28.807
How is there a cheerleader
in this movie?

13:28.809 --> 13:30.742
No kidding.

13:30.744 --> 13:35.413
Well, I'm sure some of you
had a better experience.

13:35.415 --> 13:37.448
Forgiveness doesn't work, dad.

13:37.450 --> 13:39.751
I forgave auggie
and he didn't thank me.

13:39.753 --> 13:41.419
Riley, did you
really forgive auggie?

13:41.421 --> 13:42.654
No!

13:42.656 --> 13:47.258
-Maya, did you forgive
your father?
-No.

13:47.260 --> 13:50.695
And we didn't
forgive farkle. Ow.

13:50.697 --> 13:54.799
Well, it sounds to me
like forgiveness is harder
than it looks.

13:54.801 --> 13:57.101
I tried.
Made it real clear.

13:57.103 --> 13:58.870
Want to hear it?

13:58.872 --> 14:02.440
If you're all right
with it.

14:02.442 --> 14:05.476
"in school,
I'm learning about forgiveness.

14:05.478 --> 14:10.048
"what you did makes me
have a lot of angry feelings
inside of me.

14:10.050 --> 14:12.984
"I don't want to be angry
anymore.

14:12.986 --> 14:15.787
"why did you leave?

14:15.789 --> 14:17.956
"did I do something?

14:17.958 --> 14:20.191
"make me understand
what I did.

14:20.193 --> 14:22.093
"your daughter, maya."

14:25.799 --> 14:29.234
Did he help you
to understand what happened?

14:29.236 --> 14:31.302
No.

14:31.304 --> 14:32.704
Why not?

14:34.307 --> 14:37.809
I mean, I guess I never
gave him the chance
to explain.

14:37.811 --> 14:41.713
Riley, why did auggie
bite your bear's face off?

14:41.715 --> 14:44.249
-I don't know.
-Why not?

14:44.251 --> 14:46.317
I never asked him.

14:46.319 --> 14:48.486
Lucas? Zay?

14:48.488 --> 14:51.890
Farkle, why do you tell us
the end of the movies?

14:51.892 --> 14:53.892
Well, because you're good
at everything you do.

14:53.894 --> 14:55.593
You got that
class-clown thing going.

14:55.595 --> 14:56.995
All I've got
is my mind,

14:56.997 --> 14:58.563
So I try to impress you
with it any way I can.

14:58.565 --> 15:00.164
"oh, farkle, you don't need
to impress us.

15:00.166 --> 15:01.699
"we love you
just the way you are."

15:01.701 --> 15:04.502
Farkle, we are never
going to the movies
with you again.

15:04.504 --> 15:05.670
Ever.

15:05.672 --> 15:07.105
Guess you missed that one.
Huh, farkle?

15:07.107 --> 15:08.606
No, I didn't.

15:08.608 --> 15:10.541
Oh, farkle,
you don't need to impress us.

15:10.543 --> 15:12.343
We love you
just the way you are.

15:12.345 --> 15:14.279
-Movie?
-Both: Anytime.

15:14.281 --> 15:17.849
We gotta get
better minds, man.

15:17.851 --> 15:19.884
Yeah, we do.

15:19.886 --> 15:22.687
All of you do.

15:22.689 --> 15:25.890
Better minds know
that sometimes to
really forgive someone,

15:25.892 --> 15:28.293
It helps
to understand them first.

15:28.295 --> 15:30.862
It gives the other person
a chance to be heard too.

15:30.864 --> 15:33.131
Why can't you just admit
that you're wrong about this?

15:33.133 --> 15:35.433
Because forgiveness
is one of our finest qualities

15:35.435 --> 15:36.935
As human beings, maya.

15:38.371 --> 15:40.071
You have to understand
each other

15:40.073 --> 15:42.407
Before you can even begin
to know what comes next.

15:42.409 --> 15:44.309
Go understand each other.

15:44.311 --> 15:46.210
See what happens.

15:47.881 --> 15:51.015
Your assignment
hasn't even begun
until you do.

15:59.659 --> 16:02.760
Why am I here, riley?

16:02.762 --> 16:04.495
In all the time
I've been mad at you,

16:04.497 --> 16:07.065
I don't think I actually
asked you why you did it.

16:07.067 --> 16:09.000
And now I'll probably
never know,

16:09.002 --> 16:12.003
'cause it was so long ago,
you don't even remember.

16:12.005 --> 16:13.738
How do I forgive you?

16:13.740 --> 16:16.908
It's for the same reason
I always make you mad.

16:16.910 --> 16:19.010
It's for the same reason
you get mad at me

16:19.012 --> 16:21.512
When I bother you
when you're with maya.

16:21.514 --> 16:24.415
If she wasn't
so much stronger than me,

16:24.417 --> 16:28.419
I would have bitten
her face off a long time ago.

16:28.421 --> 16:29.921
Why, auggie?

16:29.923 --> 16:33.024
Because if it wasn't
for the bear and maya,

16:33.026 --> 16:35.893
Maybe you would spend
more time with me.

16:37.697 --> 16:40.932
Auggie.

16:40.934 --> 16:43.201
I'm so sorry.

16:43.203 --> 16:45.837
How will you forgive me?

16:45.839 --> 16:47.839
I forgive you, riley.

16:47.841 --> 16:49.107
Oh.

16:49.109 --> 16:50.608
Good.

16:50.610 --> 16:52.677
Now thank me.

16:52.679 --> 16:55.246
Thank you.

16:58.952 --> 17:00.618
Forgiveness does work, maya.

17:00.620 --> 17:02.153
You just have to
do it right.

17:02.155 --> 17:05.957
-Can I go play
with my friends now?
-No!

17:05.959 --> 17:08.059
All you have to do
is listen to the other person.

17:08.061 --> 17:10.461
Can I at least go
to the bathroom, riley?

17:10.463 --> 17:13.965
Quiet. I'm talking.

17:13.967 --> 17:16.234
Auggie is there
every day, riley.

17:16.236 --> 17:18.136
My dad couldn't
get out of here fast enough.

17:18.138 --> 17:19.804
I mean,
he's halfway home by now.

17:19.806 --> 17:21.873
Forgiveness doesn't work
for everybody.

17:28.148 --> 17:31.649
I am not hungry,
so please don't throw
anything at me.

17:31.651 --> 17:35.653
I thought you left.

17:35.655 --> 17:38.656
I did. I did.
I was in the car
on the way back.

17:38.658 --> 17:40.825
And then I looked
at this thing again

17:40.827 --> 17:42.827
And it says you don't want
to be angry anymore.

17:42.829 --> 17:45.496
I know what you all are
to maya.

17:45.498 --> 17:48.866
Thank you.
I just need to borrow her
for one second,

17:48.868 --> 17:50.168
If it's okay.

18:11.391 --> 18:13.224
This wasn't you, maya.

18:13.226 --> 18:14.859
This was all me.

18:14.861 --> 18:17.261
I couldn't provide comfort
for you in a lightning storm.

18:17.263 --> 18:19.363
And I was no good for you
on a sunny day, either.

18:19.365 --> 18:22.867
I blew every paycheck
instead of providing food
for the refrigerator.

18:22.869 --> 18:25.203
And when you know
you're not good for people,

18:25.205 --> 18:26.437
You start not showing up

18:26.439 --> 18:28.106
And then you don't show up
enough times,

18:28.108 --> 18:30.108
And it begins to feel
like leaving

18:30.110 --> 18:32.210
Until you do.

18:32.212 --> 18:35.246
You're there
for your new family,
aren't you?

18:35.248 --> 18:38.316
What did they do
that I didn't do?

18:38.318 --> 18:41.953
You never did anything, maya.

18:41.955 --> 18:44.255
You were just a little girl.

18:44.257 --> 18:46.290
I was who I was.

18:46.292 --> 18:49.127
And there is nothing
you did or could have done.

18:49.129 --> 18:52.396
I just--
I wasn't ready for you

18:52.398 --> 18:54.132
Or anyone.

18:54.134 --> 18:56.400
But I think I've changed.

18:56.402 --> 19:01.072
These people believe
that I am capable
of something.

19:01.074 --> 19:03.407
They don't know
who I was.

19:03.409 --> 19:06.277
They believe
in who I am now.

19:06.279 --> 19:08.246
Who are you?

19:08.248 --> 19:11.249
I found a job.

19:11.251 --> 19:13.651
And I've managed
to keep it.

19:13.653 --> 19:17.488
I came back to tell you
that I am grateful

19:17.490 --> 19:19.490
For what you wrote.

19:19.492 --> 19:22.326
And I am sorry
for what I did.

19:22.328 --> 19:25.596
I'm glad you're okay.

19:28.001 --> 19:30.935
You found a job?

19:30.937 --> 19:32.436
I did.

19:32.438 --> 19:35.406
Your job was to stay.

19:37.110 --> 19:39.610
Thank you
for telling me your side.

19:39.612 --> 19:42.280
My teacher thinks
if I forgive you,

19:42.282 --> 19:44.448
It'll bring me peace.

19:44.450 --> 19:47.118
And he's usually right
about these things,

19:47.120 --> 19:51.122
But I don't see
how he's right
about this one.

19:51.124 --> 19:53.391
And I can't.

19:53.393 --> 19:55.826
Your job was to stay.

19:55.828 --> 19:58.796
You don't think
I had it in me

19:58.798 --> 20:02.400
To allow my father
to grow?

20:03.803 --> 20:06.571
I'm happy I wrote to you

20:06.573 --> 20:08.239
And heard
what you had to say.

20:08.241 --> 20:11.342
And it makes me feel better

20:11.344 --> 20:14.579
Knowing that I had nothing
to do with what you did.

20:14.581 --> 20:18.416
I always thought
that this was my fault
somehow,

20:18.418 --> 20:21.986
But it's not.

20:21.988 --> 20:26.424
I didn't do anything.

20:30.530 --> 20:32.363
I'm sorry

20:32.365 --> 20:34.699
I wasn't there.

20:34.701 --> 20:39.237
You-- you turned out great.

20:41.507 --> 20:44.075
Wow.

20:44.077 --> 20:46.244
What?

20:49.916 --> 20:52.950
I've been angry
for so long.

20:52.952 --> 20:56.988
I'm not angry anymore.

20:58.358 --> 21:01.926
Thank you for coming.
And I hope you get home okay.

21:12.372 --> 21:14.772
I'm sorry.

21:14.774 --> 21:17.942
I failed.

21:17.944 --> 21:20.044
I know you wanted me
to forgive him,

21:20.046 --> 21:21.545
But I didn't.

21:21.547 --> 21:25.216
I couldn't do it.

21:25.218 --> 21:28.619
You were wrong
about this one, mr. Matthews.

21:30.623 --> 21:33.057
I never expected that, maya.

21:33.059 --> 21:35.793
That kind of forgiveness,

21:35.795 --> 21:38.029
It doesn't come so easy.

21:39.999 --> 21:41.599
But life is a long time.

21:41.601 --> 21:45.403
And I hope you get there
someday.

21:45.405 --> 21:49.307
But that's never what
I was looking for right now.

21:51.978 --> 21:55.279
What did you want from me?

21:55.281 --> 21:58.416
Maya,

21:58.418 --> 22:01.185
Did you forgive yourself?

22:16.502 --> 22:20.538
I am begging you
to let me go.

22:20.540 --> 22:25.276
If you don't let me go,
I swear I will eat
your face off.

22:27.513 --> 22:30.915
Oh, sweet freedom.

22:35.288 --> 22:37.855
The forgiveness
was wonderful, dad.

22:37.857 --> 22:41.525
Once you start,
you just don't want to stop.

22:41.527 --> 22:43.494
Here.

22:43.496 --> 22:44.628
Me?

22:44.630 --> 22:47.031
What did I do?

22:48.868 --> 22:53.604
"dear dad,
I forgive you for everything."

22:54.674 --> 22:57.341
I do.

22:57.343 --> 23:00.177
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
What did I do?

23:00.179 --> 23:02.947
Oh, you know what you do.

23:04.450 --> 23:08.919
Uh, I think a person
should only be forgiven,
topanga,

23:08.921 --> 23:10.955
If that person has
actually done something wrong.

23:15.228 --> 23:16.727
Really?

23:21.234 --> 23:23.467
Oh, come on!

23:27.774 --> 23:31.375
Okay, I know
what that one is.

23:31.377 --> 23:32.943
(laughs)
