01:16.145 --> 01:19.485
Don't crowd, and do
not, under any circumstances,

01:19.611 --> 01:20.944
sneeze on me.

01:21.070 --> 01:23.448
I will write you
up if you sneeze,

01:23.531 --> 01:27.118
or if you, in any way,
get me moist with your fluids.

01:27.243 --> 01:30.789
Please, step back,
there's plenty for everyone

01:30.872 --> 01:32.707
till we run out.

01:33.165 --> 01:35.418
Okay, I need to make sure
you swallowed that.

01:35.501 --> 01:37.002
Op... Thank you.

01:40.506 --> 01:41.507
Ah!

01:42.091 --> 01:45.219
I got mad control
over my epiglottis.

02:28.805 --> 02:29.848
Here.

02:31.349 --> 02:34.268
Trust me.
Have you been out there?

02:47.239 --> 02:48.992
I look like Michael Jackson.

02:49.116 --> 02:50.535
No, I...

02:51.953 --> 02:54.873
I think you've got
the wrong skin tone.

02:54.998 --> 02:57.000
I look like Michael Jackson.

03:06.049 --> 03:07.050
Whoo!

03:19.022 --> 03:21.983
Well, if it isn't Litchfield's
biggest celebrity.

03:23.442 --> 03:24.736
I don't know what that means.

03:24.819 --> 03:26.153
Excuse me?

03:26.529 --> 03:28.698
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm just
trying to stay healthy.

03:29.532 --> 03:32.577
Boyfriend wrote quite
the article about you.

03:33.536 --> 03:34.537
Larry?

03:36.622 --> 03:40.793
Oh, my God! Oh, my God,
is that the Times?

03:40.919 --> 03:42.003
Yep.

03:42.086 --> 03:44.047
He's in the Times?

03:44.129 --> 03:45.464
What did he say?

03:45.590 --> 03:49.052
He went on and on about your
enchanting little love story.

03:49.134 --> 03:52.055
May I read it? I mean, I can wait
until you're done, obviously.

03:52.137 --> 03:54.682
I had no idea that he would
actually make it in there.

03:56.017 --> 03:58.811
Looks like I've
already thrown mine away.

04:07.319 --> 04:10.281
Too much coffee irritates
the stomach lining.

04:11.032 --> 04:12.116
Trying to cut down.

04:21.208 --> 04:22.208
Inmate! Out of the trash!

04:22.293 --> 04:23.878
But I just need to get...
Out!

04:32.053 --> 04:33.721
Hey, there, baby bump.

04:33.805 --> 04:36.015
I can't give you
the cold medicine,

04:36.140 --> 04:38.309
but I have got some
menthol cough drops.

04:38.434 --> 04:39.936
Crap.
They're somewhere in here.

04:41.646 --> 04:43.439
I don't have a cold.

04:43.564 --> 04:44.565
Oh?

04:44.816 --> 04:47.568
That's good.
Is your back hurting again?

04:50.446 --> 04:51.823
I'm in labor.

04:52.156 --> 04:53.950
Oh, fuck.

05:15.179 --> 05:16.639
Morning, Red.

05:18.182 --> 05:21.393
If you're here to ransack
my kitchen again, go ahead.

05:21.519 --> 05:24.188
The shelves could
use a little dusting.

05:24.313 --> 05:25.606
Nah.

05:26.691 --> 05:28.442
I'm here to do you a favor.

05:29.360 --> 05:30.695
No, thanks.

05:33.364 --> 05:36.034
One of your little
adopted daughters

05:36.159 --> 05:38.828
woke up in full-tilt
withdrawal this morning.

05:42.957 --> 05:44.792
Withdrawal from what?

05:46.127 --> 05:47.879
My girls are clean.

05:48.046 --> 05:49.047
Hmm.

05:49.130 --> 05:51.966
Well, I guess this
one slipped in the mud.

05:52.717 --> 05:56.721
Now that her supply's
been compromised,

05:56.971 --> 06:00.265
little Tricia's got a mean
old case of the detox blues.

06:01.100 --> 06:04.227
Then it's your fault.
Your mess.

06:04.353 --> 06:05.980
You deal with it.

06:06.105 --> 06:07.523
Believe me,

06:08.315 --> 06:12.862
you do not want to see
how I would deal with it.

06:13.529 --> 06:17.449
Now, the prison doesn't need a case
of the junkie jitters on record,

06:17.575 --> 06:20.243
and I'm pretty sure
that you don't want

06:20.369 --> 06:23.246
people thinking
you've been a bad mommy.

06:26.000 --> 06:28.586
So you're gonna
walk her through it.

06:30.046 --> 06:31.589
Quietly.

06:36.468 --> 06:40.806
This whole time,
you've been giving it to her.

06:40.932 --> 06:42.767
Really, Red?

06:43.768 --> 06:47.897
At a time like this,
does that matter?

06:51.901 --> 06:53.611
I'll take care of it.

07:06.249 --> 07:09.794
I have eighty crates
of tomatoes rotting

07:09.877 --> 07:13.923
in a Bensonhurst warehouse.
Eighty.

07:14.465 --> 07:17.218
I lower prices, our
competition lowers prices.

07:17.301 --> 07:22.056
And like this Neptune has lost
three restaurants in three weeks.

07:22.140 --> 07:24.391
The men who run these restaurants,
maybe we meet with them, maybe you

07:24.475 --> 07:25.476
make deal to bid the lowest.

07:25.559 --> 07:28.562
It's not about the prices,
it's about the books.

07:29.814 --> 07:30.815
Right.

07:30.898 --> 07:32.608
We have to move
product regularly.

07:32.691 --> 07:35.778
Then, and only then,
we can explain other income.

07:35.861 --> 07:38.781
Maybe you're not
thinking big enough.

07:39.740 --> 07:41.492
Restaurants come and go, yes?

07:42.285 --> 07:43.744
Look at this place.

07:44.162 --> 07:46.038
Every week, we almost close.

07:46.455 --> 07:48.874
But not schools.
Not hospitals.

07:49.000 --> 07:49.959
Galina...

07:50.042 --> 07:51.585
All I'm saying is,

07:51.669 --> 07:54.588
you get something big,
something steady,

07:54.880 --> 07:57.008
like the Italians
have with the garbage,

07:57.549 --> 07:59.969
then you're not
out chasing bids.

08:00.178 --> 08:04.598
My father,
he sold candy out of a box.

08:04.682 --> 08:06.309
Every day,
up and down the street.

08:06.391 --> 08:08.686
He walked so much
he wore holes in his shoes.

08:09.145 --> 08:11.189
Until one day,
he passed by an army base,

08:11.355 --> 08:13.398
right after
the soldiers' lunchtime.

08:14.150 --> 08:16.152
And he realized
that all he had to do

08:16.235 --> 08:19.071
was stand there
and open his box.

08:19.488 --> 08:21.324
He sold out in minutes.

08:22.033 --> 08:25.036
So he did it again,
day after day.

08:25.203 --> 08:27.079
There were always soldiers,

08:27.205 --> 08:28.539
there was always lunch,

08:28.664 --> 08:31.167
and they always
wanted candy bars.

08:31.250 --> 08:33.376
No more holes in his shoes.

08:37.548 --> 08:38.883
I need more cream.

08:39.299 --> 08:41.260
Of course, honey.

09:00.445 --> 09:02.073
Got enough, bro?

09:02.489 --> 09:05.076
I wrote something in here.
Uh, a column.

09:05.201 --> 09:06.952
Look. Look, look.

09:08.954 --> 09:11.332
See that? That's me.

09:11.999 --> 09:13.751
I'm a writer.
No shit.

09:13.834 --> 09:14.835
Yeah.

09:14.919 --> 09:16.045
Arturo!

09:17.129 --> 09:18.089
Yeah?

09:18.214 --> 09:20.007
Dude right here's in the paper.

09:21.342 --> 09:22.301
What'd he do?

09:22.426 --> 09:24.220
Check it.
Says he wrote a column!

09:24.929 --> 09:27.890
For real?
Yo, that's sick, son!

09:28.682 --> 09:29.641
It is?

09:29.767 --> 09:32.937
Someday you're gonna write
the whole paper, bro.

09:34.939 --> 09:36.023
Okay.

09:36.440 --> 09:37.900
Yo, you on Facebook?

09:52.831 --> 09:54.250
Shit.

09:57.962 --> 09:58.921
Hello?

09:59.004 --> 10:00.423
An inmate from
Litchfield Federal Prison

10:00.505 --> 10:01.840
is attempting to contact you.

10:01.966 --> 10:03.801
To accept this call,
please press one.

10:04.676 --> 10:06.262
- Hey.
- Larry?

10:06.345 --> 10:07.388
I've got great news.

10:07.471 --> 10:08.722
Hi! I know.

10:08.889 --> 10:10.015
You know?

10:10.141 --> 10:11.309
Yeah,
your article came out today.

10:11.392 --> 10:12.517
Isn't it great?

10:12.643 --> 10:16.147
I mean, I wasn't expecting it,
but I got the call last night.

10:16.230 --> 10:17.940
So, apparently they
pulled Randy's story

10:18.023 --> 10:20.609
about, uh, the surge
in home breweries in Brooklyn

10:20.692 --> 10:22.486
because The New Yorker
is running one

10:22.611 --> 10:24.322
on the surge in home
wineries in Brooklyn.

10:24.447 --> 10:25.530
So they ran mine instead.

10:25.656 --> 10:26.824
That's great, honey.

10:26.949 --> 10:28.349
I know.
Everyone's been so positive.

10:28.451 --> 10:31.370
My high school English teacher
called my parents.

10:31.495 --> 10:34.415
Your brother, he sent me a picture
text of a thumbs up.

10:34.498 --> 10:35.833
Can you read it to me?

10:36.417 --> 10:39.503
Want me to read it?
I am going to read it.

10:39.628 --> 10:42.089
"One Sentence, Two Prisoners."

10:42.173 --> 10:44.175
That sounds like
"Two Girls, One Cup."

10:44.300 --> 10:47.845
No, it doesn't. This is
one, two, not two, one.

10:47.970 --> 10:49.805
And no one is
shitting in any cup, okay?

10:49.888 --> 10:51.974
I left that part out.
Your secret is safe.

10:52.057 --> 10:53.309
Thanks.

10:54.477 --> 10:56.479
Oh, hold on. Another one.

10:56.979 --> 10:59.023
Let's see what it says.
It's from Pete.

11:02.985 --> 11:05.321
Porn. He just... He sent porn.

11:09.074 --> 11:11.202
What is that? Is that porn?

11:11.910 --> 11:12.911
Oh...

11:13.245 --> 11:14.913
Oh, Maria might be in labor.

11:15.039 --> 11:16.123
What?

11:16.374 --> 11:18.876
Could you google
symptoms of labor?

11:18.959 --> 11:20.336
They're running bets.

11:20.419 --> 11:24.173
If I guess closest to the birth
time, I could win a Twix.

11:24.715 --> 11:26.591
I want to make
an educated guess.

11:26.717 --> 11:28.135
Isn't there a doctor in there?

11:28.219 --> 11:29.220
There's a nurse.

11:29.303 --> 11:30.553
He says that she's gotta
wait till her contractions

11:30.679 --> 11:32.679
are less than a minute apart
to go to the hospital.

11:33.224 --> 11:35.434
That's cutting it pretty close.
All right, here we go.

11:36.143 --> 11:39.438
Okay, if her cervix has softened,
she's definitely in labor.

11:39.562 --> 11:42.024
Larry, how am I supposed to
tell if her cervix is soft?

11:42.107 --> 11:45.110
Oh, wait. Crowning.
Let's look at crowning.

11:45.736 --> 11:47.154
Oh, Jesus Christ.

11:47.946 --> 11:49.114
Yeah.

11:49.240 --> 11:50.908
I'll definitely
send that to Pete.

11:51.033 --> 11:54.453
Speaking of whom, he is taking
me out for a drink tonight.

11:54.577 --> 11:59.041
Uh, Polly, too. And some other people.
To, uh, celebrate.

11:59.417 --> 12:01.043
Sounds like fun.

12:03.045 --> 12:04.129
Who else is going?

12:04.255 --> 12:07.674
I don't know. Polly made a
last-minute Evite so...

12:07.758 --> 12:10.635
So you're having a party.
An Evite equals party.

12:10.761 --> 12:13.161
Why didn't you just tell me you
were going to a party tonight?

12:13.264 --> 12:14.597
With all of our friends.

12:14.681 --> 12:17.600
You're not here to tell me I can't
wear brown shoes with black pants.

12:17.726 --> 12:19.395
It's pretty basic.

12:20.020 --> 12:21.604
I know. Still.

12:24.607 --> 12:26.818
I am really happy for you.

12:28.571 --> 12:30.613
This is a really big thing.

12:32.157 --> 12:34.326
And it deserves
to be celebrated.

12:36.495 --> 12:37.913
Yeah, okay.

12:38.663 --> 12:40.916
You're gonna have a great time.

12:41.875 --> 12:43.294
And you deserve that.

12:46.505 --> 12:48.549
And on my end,

12:49.632 --> 12:52.553
I have a really
strong shot at a Twix bar.

12:53.804 --> 12:55.180
It's a great day.

12:55.638 --> 12:57.433
Of course.

12:57.640 --> 12:59.977
I have to go to work soon.
Can you read me the article?

13:01.686 --> 13:04.482
The rest of the world got to
read your story before I did.

13:04.565 --> 13:05.899
Our story.

13:08.235 --> 13:09.320
Okay.

13:09.403 --> 13:10.613
Okay. Here it goes.

13:10.695 --> 13:12.531
"It always starts the same way,

13:12.655 --> 13:14.492
"with a latte
and a bacon scone.

13:14.617 --> 13:15.826
"And then I hit the road..."

13:16.994 --> 13:18.287
You gotta walk, honey.

13:18.370 --> 13:20.289
I'ma kill that motherfucker!
The nurse?

13:20.372 --> 13:22.916
My boyfriend.
And the nurse, too.

13:25.377 --> 13:27.421
Fuck him
and his fucking mother.

13:27.505 --> 13:28.755
Time?
It's the same.

13:28.839 --> 13:30.841
He said she cannot come back
until they're closer. I'm sorry.

13:30.966 --> 13:32.301
That maricon
wouldn't know labor

13:32.384 --> 13:34.136
if that baby popped out and
slapped him in the fucking face.

13:34.219 --> 13:35.678
Well, it's not him.
It's the rules.

13:35.762 --> 13:37.389
Well,
he's the face of the rules.

13:37.515 --> 13:39.224
Just keep walking, mami.
I'm gonna try.

13:39.350 --> 13:41.852
Here. Had to haggle with las
negritas, but I got it.

13:41.977 --> 13:42.978
Got what?

13:43.061 --> 13:45.814
To get Lucy coming out, they
made me eat a whole pineapple.

13:46.357 --> 13:47.690
But that's pineapple soda.

13:47.774 --> 13:49.860
You know, for my son, they told
me to play with my chichitas.

13:49.985 --> 13:51.736
You know, it just
gets the hormones going.

13:51.862 --> 13:54.023
You know, you gotta just twiddle them.
You wanna try it?

13:56.033 --> 13:58.536
Come on, less talking.
Just breathe.

13:58.661 --> 14:00.496
Okay. Come on.

14:14.635 --> 14:15.927
And then there were two.

14:16.053 --> 14:17.471
Where is everybody?

14:17.555 --> 14:21.016
They're sick. Pussies. I don't
believe in getting sick.

14:21.266 --> 14:22.267
Wow.

14:22.518 --> 14:23.477
Mind over mucous, huh?

14:23.561 --> 14:24.562
Yeah.

14:24.645 --> 14:27.147
That, and I stockpile
from commissary.

14:27.231 --> 14:28.566
I'm on a cough syrup cocktail

14:28.691 --> 14:30.234
that would make Lil Wayne
vomit in his dreads.

14:32.570 --> 14:34.405
New reading material.

14:34.738 --> 14:36.907
I'm assuming you're
both fluent in Hindi.

14:36.990 --> 14:38.659
I think there are pictures.

14:40.327 --> 14:42.287
There's a broken
dryer in the laundry room.

14:42.413 --> 14:44.873
Martha or Maddie or some shit.

14:44.956 --> 14:48.544
I can't keep track of the nicknames.
Just, uh, take care of it.

14:49.211 --> 14:50.254
How?

14:52.631 --> 14:54.383
Make it not broken.

15:11.275 --> 15:13.277
Man, I'm never
gonna get this shit.

15:13.360 --> 15:15.195
The label fell off.

15:15.362 --> 15:18.323
Guide to Bird-Watching.
Seven-hundreds?

15:18.449 --> 15:20.367
Five-hundreds.
That's science.

15:20.451 --> 15:21.619
But it's a hobby, though.

15:21.702 --> 15:23.579
A hobby about science.

15:25.456 --> 15:26.665
Okay.

15:27.291 --> 15:29.543
So, you gonna tell me
how it went, or what?

15:29.627 --> 15:30.961
How what went?

15:31.044 --> 15:32.963
Your bat mitzvah, bitch! What
do you think I'm talking about?

15:33.088 --> 15:35.424
I don't know. It went.

15:36.425 --> 15:39.470
A bunch of people I never met
looked at my case file.

15:39.553 --> 15:40.804
One guy had a beard.

15:40.887 --> 15:42.208
They asked you
a lot of questions?

15:42.264 --> 15:43.474
Not as many as you.

15:47.394 --> 15:48.853
All right, look.
I really appreciate

15:48.979 --> 15:50.439
you trying to
teach me all this,

15:50.522 --> 15:51.523
getting me assigned
and every...

15:51.649 --> 15:52.650
Shh!

15:56.779 --> 16:00.365
Look, what I mean is,
if you don't leave,

16:00.616 --> 16:02.367
I'll just go right
back to clean crew.

16:02.493 --> 16:04.013
This your job.
I know you like it here.

16:04.119 --> 16:06.413
Don't nobody like it here.

16:09.166 --> 16:10.668
Your hair looked good.

16:13.253 --> 16:14.254
It did.

16:28.393 --> 16:30.313
Attention,
all personnel, be advised

16:30.354 --> 16:32.147
count is not clear.
Please conduct a recount.

16:34.358 --> 16:35.734
Hey, there.

16:36.485 --> 16:37.528
Hey.

16:38.153 --> 16:40.364
Hear you got
a broken appliance, ma'am.

16:41.114 --> 16:42.115
Yeah?

16:42.199 --> 16:44.951
A real rusty old thing
that needs fixing?

16:45.118 --> 16:47.996
Oh, well, my husband isn't home.
He's got the checkbook.

16:48.079 --> 16:50.040
Hopefully there's
some way I could pay you.

16:50.207 --> 16:53.752
Well, I have been
feeling a little tense lately.

16:54.169 --> 16:57.631
Maybe if I stick my dick in your
mouth, it might help me relax.

16:57.756 --> 16:59.424
Oh, God. No, thanks.

16:59.717 --> 17:02.386
What? Too hetero?

17:03.637 --> 17:07.223
Okay. How about
"wrench in your twat"?

17:10.394 --> 17:12.730
All right. Well, the broken one's
over there, and her name's Myra.

17:12.855 --> 17:14.647
So you can stick
your wrench in her twat.

17:20.654 --> 17:22.573
I hate when she
sends The Quiet Storm.

17:22.698 --> 17:24.241
Can't she just come over
and tap you on the shoulder?

17:24.366 --> 17:28.746
She has an irrational fear of the spin cycle.
Won't step foot in here.

17:28.871 --> 17:29.872
I'd better go.

17:29.954 --> 17:31.998
Yeah, well...
Mommy needs you.

17:32.082 --> 17:35.919
Can't be that serious. When it's
serious, she throws coconuts.

17:43.176 --> 17:44.177
Come on!

17:53.103 --> 17:55.480
You don't look
half bad in those.

17:59.610 --> 18:00.652
Thanks.

18:02.279 --> 18:03.988
You sure you know
what you're doing?

18:04.114 --> 18:05.449
I have no idea.

18:05.574 --> 18:07.033
Don't lie to me.

18:07.117 --> 18:10.203
She made a mistake, okay?
She's 19 years old.

18:10.287 --> 18:14.124
I covered for her when she got here.
Hmm? Just like I did for you.

18:14.291 --> 18:16.042
And I warned her if it ever...

18:16.126 --> 18:17.878
It's not like it's her choice.

18:17.961 --> 18:20.923
I mean, she's an addict, all right?
She had a slip.

18:21.005 --> 18:22.424
We can help her.
Just give her a chance.

18:22.507 --> 18:25.719
No more chances. Two strikes,
that's what she gets.

18:25.803 --> 18:27.679
Russians don't play baseball.

18:27.805 --> 18:29.180
Jesus, with this shit.

18:29.306 --> 18:31.224
She needs to go down,

18:31.308 --> 18:34.436
and whoever she drags down
with her deserves it.

18:37.481 --> 18:40.984
You send her down the hill,
she's fucked, and you know it.

18:41.067 --> 18:42.986
Okay, you're
taking this personally.

18:43.111 --> 18:44.988
It's not personal,
it's chemical.

18:45.113 --> 18:47.354
Drugs have a way of making you
do shit you don't wanna do.

18:49.993 --> 18:51.202
So do I.

18:59.920 --> 19:00.963
Okay.

19:08.303 --> 19:09.930
I look pathetic.
I'm aware.

19:10.013 --> 19:11.014
I wasn't laughing at you.

19:11.181 --> 19:12.182
Right.

19:12.265 --> 19:13.892
Anyway,
significantly less funny

19:14.017 --> 19:15.686
than the time you
fixed our toaster

19:15.769 --> 19:16.937
with a hot glue gun.

19:21.483 --> 19:23.193
You wanna see something?
What?

19:23.318 --> 19:25.320
Okay, so we don't just do
inmate laundry, right?

19:25.403 --> 19:26.446
Right.

19:26.530 --> 19:28.740
Some of the guards
drop off their clothes, too.

19:28.866 --> 19:30.408
So, Wanda Bell?

19:30.534 --> 19:32.369
You might remember her as the
bloodsucking dragon-cunt?

19:32.452 --> 19:34.329
She works up front,
eats souls for fun?

19:34.412 --> 19:38.375
Every once in a while, we find a
pair of men's boxers in there.

19:40.168 --> 19:43.254
No big deal. Even Bigfoot's
gonna get laid sometimes.

19:43.588 --> 19:45.632
Except these boxers...
Oh!

19:45.716 --> 19:47.926
...have a name stitched on
them like he's a third grader.

19:48.385 --> 19:49.386
S. O'Neill.

19:49.761 --> 19:52.347
No!
The guard S. O'Neill?

19:52.430 --> 19:53.932
Drama!

19:54.057 --> 19:55.225
Where does that belly go?

19:55.350 --> 19:56.518
I don't know.

19:56.601 --> 19:57.602
Ooh!

19:57.728 --> 19:59.437
Hey! Y'all done having fun?

20:02.524 --> 20:04.526
We're just
getting started, bitch.

20:13.159 --> 20:15.078
I should finish fixing that.
You want some help?

20:17.330 --> 20:18.415
No, that's really okay.

20:18.540 --> 20:20.166
I work these machines all day.

20:21.084 --> 20:24.254
I saw Little Sarah get a shot for
helping Nicky hold a ladder.

20:24.337 --> 20:25.630
So?

20:25.881 --> 20:28.926
You're laundry, I'm electric.
We're from different worlds.

20:34.138 --> 20:35.348
And I don't want any trouble.

20:35.766 --> 20:37.392
Oh, fuck her.

20:37.809 --> 20:41.271
I'm gonna help you,
no strings attached.

21:07.798 --> 21:09.299
How goes it?

21:09.424 --> 21:10.884
I've been better.

21:10.968 --> 21:13.261
If I tell you it gets easier,
does that make me corny?

21:13.386 --> 21:14.638
Makes you a liar.

21:17.140 --> 21:21.144
Yeah. Brought you some O.J.
Carton, not Simpson.

21:24.731 --> 21:27.317
Man, this clinic my
mom dragged me to,

21:27.400 --> 21:29.277
they strapped me down
to a bed just like this.

21:30.654 --> 21:34.032
So the nurses hated me, 'cause
I kept makin' Exorcist jokes.

21:34.157 --> 21:36.326
"Your mother sucks cocks
in hell!"

21:37.410 --> 21:39.162
That shit never
gets old, right?

21:41.748 --> 21:43.625
I might actually be
lucky this happened now.

21:43.708 --> 21:46.377
Guards just think I
got the flu like everyone else.

21:46.503 --> 21:48.922
Well, in two days, you're gonna
be wishing you had the flu.

21:50.548 --> 21:51.925
I'm lucky you're here with me.

21:52.050 --> 21:53.384
Yeah.

21:53.510 --> 21:56.013
And I'll get through it.
I'll get back on track.

21:56.138 --> 21:57.681
They won't even
find out I was using.

21:57.764 --> 21:58.932
Yes, they will.

21:59.016 --> 22:01.518
Shit, no.
Girls got my back, right?

22:01.893 --> 22:04.312
I ain't never snitched nobody,
so who's gonna tell 'em?

22:05.396 --> 22:06.397
You are.

22:06.523 --> 22:07.524
What?

22:07.941 --> 22:10.777
Two strikes.
That's all you get.

22:12.154 --> 22:14.447
Red sent me. Says she
doesn't play baseball.

22:14.531 --> 22:17.575
I'm quitting, Nicky. Tell her that.
Don't make me go down there.

22:17.701 --> 22:18.827
This isn't about you.

22:19.410 --> 22:23.247
Red's fighting a bigger fight.
Shit's changing around here.

22:23.373 --> 22:26.043
She is supposed
to take care of us.

22:28.461 --> 22:30.047
You're gonna get up.

22:30.130 --> 22:31.548
You're gonna walk down
to the CO's office...

22:31.631 --> 22:32.590
Please.

22:32.716 --> 22:33.758
You're gonna tell
him you were using

22:33.884 --> 22:34.926
and throw yourself
on his mercy.

22:35.052 --> 22:36.761
They'll put me in the SHU,
and I'll die in there.

22:36.887 --> 22:39.056
You won't die, you'll suffer.

22:39.848 --> 22:43.643
And then you'll come back out.
Say what you need to say.

22:44.186 --> 22:46.437
You're supposed
to be my family.

22:48.565 --> 22:50.441
Not anymore.

22:58.992 --> 23:02.079
Nicky!
Nicky, no! No!

23:02.495 --> 23:05.498
Please. Please!
Please, don't go!

23:06.124 --> 23:07.751
Stop. Wait!

23:07.876 --> 23:09.419
Damn.

23:09.544 --> 23:11.088
Esta bien, okay?
Come on, mama.

23:11.213 --> 23:12.214
Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm.
Almost there.

23:12.296 --> 23:13.464
All right.
You're doing great. Okay.

23:13.590 --> 23:14.758
Okay.

23:14.841 --> 23:15.884
Lie down.

23:15.967 --> 23:17.343
Oh, just my luck, right?
I go into labor

23:17.468 --> 23:18.845
the day
the fucking plague hits.

23:19.470 --> 23:20.710
They'll be here soon.
Just rest.

23:22.057 --> 23:23.558
You're gonna need your energy.

23:24.768 --> 23:27.062
You, quiet.
She's laboring here.

23:27.145 --> 23:28.605
Is the baby gonna
be staying with us?

23:30.440 --> 23:32.109
You see any babies around here?

23:32.234 --> 23:33.401
Besides you?

23:35.612 --> 23:39.950
I'll be back.
Breathe. Relax and breathe.

23:40.617 --> 23:42.744
And if you feel like you
gotta go to the bathroom,

23:42.827 --> 23:44.121
that's the baby comin'.

23:44.246 --> 23:45.287
Huh?
Hold it in

23:45.413 --> 23:47.289
and pray it doesn't
turn out like that one.

23:48.290 --> 23:50.292
Okay? I'll be right back.

23:54.089 --> 23:57.092
Y'all are like a novela.
You know that, right?

23:57.341 --> 23:59.970
Y'all are like some
cautionary tale shit.

24:00.095 --> 24:02.764
You two should tour
high schools for abstinence,

24:02.847 --> 24:06.017
'cause a minute with you two
is better than Plan B.

24:06.893 --> 24:07.978
Whatever.

24:10.147 --> 24:13.275
If my daughter ever
talked to me that way...

24:14.151 --> 24:16.569
If I ever talk
to her that way...

24:17.070 --> 24:19.363
I mean, shit.
What's the point?

24:20.322 --> 24:23.618
This world is full enough with
bitches trying to kill you.

24:28.623 --> 24:31.835
The hospital van just parked.
Let's go have a baby.

24:35.839 --> 24:37.299
Okay, okay.

24:37.381 --> 24:38.382
Good, good, good. Okay.

24:40.468 --> 24:41.803
Oh, my God...

24:41.886 --> 24:44.014
All right,
let's get you to the van.

24:44.097 --> 24:45.974
Everything's going to be okay.

24:49.186 --> 24:50.520
Hey, uh...

24:51.188 --> 24:53.273
Okay, so be careful.

24:53.355 --> 24:55.525
Relax. I do this all the time.

24:56.358 --> 24:57.359
Why?

24:57.485 --> 24:59.237
Because it's fucked up.

24:59.361 --> 25:01.405
And when you work
with geniuses like I do,

25:01.531 --> 25:03.616
the motor gets
stuck all the time.

25:03.700 --> 25:04.826
Did you find it?

25:04.951 --> 25:06.995
I don't know. I need a
little more light back here.

25:07.078 --> 25:08.705
Okay. How about that?

25:09.331 --> 25:10.832
Better.
Okay.

25:13.375 --> 25:15.212
So,
it looks like the safety lock

25:15.377 --> 25:17.214
is connected
with a blue wire...

25:17.297 --> 25:18.298
Okay.

25:18.380 --> 25:20.424
...to something back
there that's got, like,

25:20.550 --> 25:22.593
two screws
sticking right out of it,

25:22.719 --> 25:25.387
and it's right next
to this T-shaped thing.

25:28.183 --> 25:29.809
Oh, damn it!

25:29.893 --> 25:31.686
Shit!
Shit!

25:31.769 --> 25:33.188
I have to get more batteries.

25:33.271 --> 25:34.564
Fuck! My glasses fell off.

25:34.689 --> 25:35.940
I'll be right back.

25:36.066 --> 25:38.442
I think I can
reach it if I could

25:38.568 --> 25:40.987
just angle my
fucking hand back there.

25:43.573 --> 25:44.782
What the fuck?

25:48.578 --> 25:49.913
What the hell are you doing?

25:49.996 --> 25:51.373
Who, me?

25:53.083 --> 25:55.668
I'm just getting started,
bitch.

26:08.139 --> 26:09.140
Oh...

26:09.933 --> 26:11.268
Fuck me.

26:17.648 --> 26:19.109
You wanted to see me?

26:20.402 --> 26:21.611
Patricia Miller.

26:22.195 --> 26:26.283
Trailer park all-star
with the classy neck tat?

26:26.366 --> 26:27.784
Oh, yeah.

26:28.034 --> 26:32.622
She just got a 100 series shot
for a nasty case of the DTs.

26:32.956 --> 26:33.957
Wow.

26:34.040 --> 26:35.959
Hope they got a lot
of mops in the SHU.

26:37.627 --> 26:38.836
Did she say anything?

26:38.962 --> 26:40.630
She just cried and shook.

26:41.131 --> 26:43.716
Thing is,
she's been here 10 months.

26:44.801 --> 26:48.179
How come she doesn't go
cold turkey a while back?

26:49.597 --> 26:51.057
Something's been
getting in here.

26:51.141 --> 26:53.017
I always said,
when they first come through,

26:53.143 --> 26:55.061
we should check their
assholes thoroughly.

26:55.145 --> 26:59.565
If the wrong person realizes there's
product moving through this prison...

26:59.649 --> 27:02.693
It's one junkie.
It's an isolated thing.

27:02.819 --> 27:05.655
Oh, really?
I bet my balls we get 10 more

27:05.780 --> 27:08.158
sweating it out by
the end of the month.

27:11.577 --> 27:15.706
And if they turn up, the warden's
gonna want somebody's head.

27:17.334 --> 27:19.501
And it ain't gonna be mine.

27:20.753 --> 27:23.006
I'm sure it'll all be fine.

27:23.840 --> 27:27.509
Besides, whatever she was
doing clearly ran out, right?

27:28.219 --> 27:30.554
So you're good.

27:31.055 --> 27:33.808
Let's see how good
I am a week from now.

27:34.767 --> 27:36.686
I hope, for all our sakes,
you're right.

27:40.606 --> 27:43.193
And Mendez? Question.

27:43.818 --> 27:45.445
It's off-topic.

27:45.903 --> 27:48.490
I got a look in a bar
last night.

27:48.948 --> 27:51.326
This guy...

27:53.370 --> 27:57.748
The mustache. It hasn't become
like a gay thing, has it?

27:59.709 --> 28:01.794
No. Fuck, no. Gay!

28:02.753 --> 28:05.882
The 'stache is not for fags,
it's for fuckin' men.

28:06.007 --> 28:07.008
Yeah.

28:07.133 --> 28:08.092
It's fuckin' all-beef,

28:08.218 --> 28:10.428
fucking cunt-ramming awesome.

28:12.222 --> 28:13.390
Okay.

28:14.556 --> 28:16.226
Just checking.

28:24.108 --> 28:26.403
Oh, my God. Alex?

28:27.111 --> 28:28.196
Get me out of here.

28:28.279 --> 28:31.782
What?
It's locked. Are you okay?

28:31.949 --> 28:32.992
No!

28:33.076 --> 28:34.994
Maybe I can, uh...

28:36.287 --> 28:37.288
What the hell happened?

28:37.414 --> 28:38.581
It was that
fucking meth-head!

28:38.998 --> 28:40.791
Seriously?
Yes!

28:41.084 --> 28:42.885
I'm gonna go get help.
No, no, no! No, no, no!

28:43.627 --> 28:44.837
Just open the door.

28:44.921 --> 28:47.090
If they find out that I was helping
you, I'm gonna get in trouble.

28:47.173 --> 28:48.341
You said so yourself.

28:48.425 --> 28:49.509
You offered.

28:49.633 --> 28:50.760
Are you serious?

28:50.843 --> 28:52.929
I told you that
this was a bad idea.

28:53.054 --> 28:54.180
I did!

28:54.264 --> 28:55.473
Don't you do that!
Do what?

28:55.598 --> 28:57.517
That thing.
Like this is my fault.

28:57.600 --> 28:58.601
You know what I mean.

28:58.726 --> 29:00.353
Like you aren't
accountable for anything

29:00.478 --> 29:02.105
that ever happens
in your life, ever.

29:02.230 --> 29:04.630
Am I supposed to tell them that
I made you get into the dryer?

29:04.648 --> 29:07.151
No, I want you to get me out.

29:07.318 --> 29:11.364
Read that manual, unjam the
door, step the fuck up!

29:13.783 --> 29:15.159
Wait, Piper,
where are you going?

29:15.285 --> 29:16.327
I'm just gonna go...

29:16.453 --> 29:17.454
No! Don't you go!

29:17.579 --> 29:19.247
Don't you fucking leave me.

29:29.215 --> 29:30.383
Okay.

29:32.260 --> 29:33.303
"Okay," what?

29:38.391 --> 29:39.642
I'm here.

29:46.566 --> 29:50.445
So, this is all of 'em, huh?
All the approved vendors?

29:50.528 --> 29:52.655
That's it.
Just those five.

29:53.239 --> 29:55.699
Nobody else gets
through this gate?

29:56.075 --> 29:58.161
No suspicious delivery guy,

29:58.286 --> 30:01.623
no shady-lookin' mook
in a fuckin' tampon truck?

30:01.914 --> 30:05.709
There's creepy linens dude,
and the dry goods lady,

30:05.876 --> 30:07.837
the vegetable people.

30:08.838 --> 30:12.467
Sounds like a horror movie, doesn't it?
The Vegetable People?

30:12.550 --> 30:17.888
Like a giant celery serial
killer, carrying a machete,

30:18.014 --> 30:22.477
or broccoli lightin'
shit up with a flame-thrower.

30:24.354 --> 30:27.190
"Who's a smoothie,
now, bitches?"

30:30.652 --> 30:32.028
Asshole.

30:33.029 --> 30:34.322
Shit's funny.

30:35.114 --> 30:36.274
It's almost count time.

30:36.282 --> 30:37.325
I know. I know.

30:37.741 --> 30:39.118
I'm pretty sure
I'm suffocating.

30:40.161 --> 30:41.663
Ow!

30:42.622 --> 30:44.123
Loud.
Sorry.

30:47.418 --> 30:49.920
So, what,
Nicky never came back?

30:50.505 --> 30:53.257
Your girlfriend? No.

30:55.426 --> 30:56.386
My girlfriend?

30:56.511 --> 30:57.512
Yeah.

30:58.179 --> 30:59.763
What's that supposed to mean?

30:59.889 --> 31:01.516
Nothing. Never mind.

31:01.599 --> 31:02.850
No, what do you mean by that?

31:02.975 --> 31:04.227
I said, nothing.
I said, never mind.

31:04.310 --> 31:06.270
What, you expect me to wait
for you to come around?

31:06.896 --> 31:08.690
Come around?
Yeah.

31:08.772 --> 31:11.651
As in "get back
together" come around?

31:11.775 --> 31:13.570
Are you kidding me?

31:14.571 --> 31:16.406
I'm engaged.
Right.

31:17.407 --> 31:19.909
You know what?
Do not confuse this.

31:20.910 --> 31:26.790
Maybe, just maybe, we will
get friendly again. Maybe.

31:26.916 --> 31:28.751
We were never friends, Piper.
We weren't...

31:28.876 --> 31:31.254
No. Not for a second.

31:32.088 --> 31:35.717
I loved you,
I loved having sex with you.

31:40.012 --> 31:42.765
And more importantly, I am not
suggesting that I want you back,

31:42.890 --> 31:44.267
you Park Slope narcissist.

31:44.350 --> 31:48.020
I mean for you to come around
like an actual human being.

31:48.104 --> 31:50.814
And not with some
hollow bullshit apology,

31:50.940 --> 31:54.736
or that cute little sad face that
might work on your fucking boyfriend.

31:55.986 --> 31:57.447
I've been waiting
for you to come around,

31:57.572 --> 31:58.948
and treat me like
an actual human being

31:59.073 --> 32:01.618
and realize what a fucking
horse's ass you've been.

32:01.701 --> 32:02.952
I've been a horse's ass?

32:03.077 --> 32:04.287
Fuck, yeah!

32:04.370 --> 32:06.872
Fuck you! And this dryer!

32:06.956 --> 32:11.502
This fucking shitty
piece of goddamn dryer!

32:12.878 --> 32:13.921
Dryer!

32:15.715 --> 32:17.383
So abusive.

32:18.342 --> 32:21.178
Maybe if you tried
talking nice to it,

32:21.304 --> 32:26.476
or, uh, if you took your top
off and rubbed up against it.

32:26.601 --> 32:28.436
Might, uh, pop open then,
right, huh?

32:30.480 --> 32:31.648
Shit.

32:37.737 --> 32:38.988
What the hell's going on?

32:39.280 --> 32:40.323
Fuck.

32:43.159 --> 32:44.744
Where was it we're going?

32:44.827 --> 32:46.870
Wherever I tell you to go.

32:47.997 --> 32:52.669
Okay. It's just, I'm not supposed
to be this far from camp.

32:54.086 --> 32:57.757
You're not supposed to wear that
pretty whore lipstick either,

32:58.549 --> 32:59.801
but you do, don't ya?

33:10.019 --> 33:11.228
Yeah, stop here.

33:15.232 --> 33:16.900
Shut the car off.

33:28.954 --> 33:30.790
The old Moscow mule.

33:31.874 --> 33:32.916
Red?

33:33.042 --> 33:34.960
She's got a way of
bringing stuff in.

33:35.961 --> 33:39.799
It's not really up to code.
Do you know what I mean?

33:40.090 --> 33:41.384
No.

33:41.801 --> 33:44.053
I need to know how.

33:47.515 --> 33:49.642
I don't know what
you're talking about.

33:49.726 --> 33:52.436
I drive, I don't work kitchen.

33:52.562 --> 33:55.231
I know. You're afraid of her.

33:58.776 --> 34:02.655
Shit,
I don't blame you.

34:03.740 --> 34:06.075
But you know what?

34:09.579 --> 34:15.585
There are things out here much worse
than some scary Russian bitch.

34:21.090 --> 34:23.926
I'm gonna ask you again.
Nicely.

34:25.511 --> 34:30.725
And then the third time,
it's not gonna be very nice.

34:32.685 --> 34:33.936
For you.

34:37.188 --> 34:38.608
I told you.

34:39.900 --> 34:42.027
I don't know what she does.

34:42.110 --> 34:44.781
I drive,
and I do what I need to do.

34:48.409 --> 34:52.621
And I can't help you
'cause I really don't know.

34:55.040 --> 34:58.043
So you do whatever.

35:00.254 --> 35:03.132
I can't tell you
what I don't know.

35:18.856 --> 35:20.858
Start the car, inmate.

35:21.150 --> 35:23.152
You're too far from camp.

35:30.033 --> 35:33.454
I mean, what
exactly were you two doing?

35:33.537 --> 35:34.497
When I got there,

35:34.622 --> 35:36.874
the blonde one was screaming and
the hot one was stuck inside.

35:36.999 --> 35:38.167
The hot one?
The hot one?

35:40.753 --> 35:42.546
You can go, Luchek.

35:43.172 --> 35:45.883
Okay.
And it's, uh, Luschek.

35:47.677 --> 35:49.512
Like a "loose check."

35:52.014 --> 35:55.142
How long have I
worked here, man? God!

35:56.310 --> 35:57.311
Mr. Healy, it was...
I asked her.

35:58.521 --> 35:59.642
No, I...
Look, I volunteered.

35:59.647 --> 36:00.606
No, no, no.
I asked her.

36:00.690 --> 36:01.858
She works in the laundry room,

36:01.983 --> 36:04.485
so I figured she knew more
about the machines than I did.

36:04.568 --> 36:08.364
I know that I wasn't
supposed to, but I did.

36:08.698 --> 36:10.157
This is my fault.
No. Mr. Healy...

36:10.282 --> 36:11.450
Now, just shut up.

36:15.997 --> 36:20.417
A couple of years ago, we found two
women naked from the waist down,

36:20.543 --> 36:23.713
sitting on those dryers
for their own enjoyment.

36:26.215 --> 36:28.896
You wouldn't happen to have been
doing anything like that, would you?

36:30.219 --> 36:31.679
I'm more of
a dishwasher kind of gal, sir.

36:34.264 --> 36:36.099
What?
Nothing.

36:42.773 --> 36:44.400
Glad you're making
new friends, Chapman.

36:45.693 --> 36:46.903
I'm writing you both a shot.

36:46.986 --> 36:48.821
Now get the hell
out of my office.

36:52.616 --> 36:53.993
Chapman.

36:54.911 --> 36:58.163
You think if I wrote stories about
you, I might make the papers?

36:59.999 --> 37:02.960
'Cause I'm gathering
a nice collection here.

37:07.673 --> 37:11.385
Due to repairs, clean
clothes can be picked up tomorrow.

37:21.896 --> 37:24.607
Whoa. You moved her in?
The fuck is she doing?

37:24.690 --> 37:28.193
What I told her to do.
And watch your tone.

37:28.277 --> 37:30.112
It's my bunk, too.
I get no say in this?

37:30.237 --> 37:32.949
No one gets a say. She was
assigned by her counselor.

37:33.074 --> 37:34.155
And she'll be good for you.

37:34.241 --> 37:35.576
She never talks.

37:35.701 --> 37:37.078
You might learn something.

37:41.665 --> 37:43.333
I've got friends
of my own, you know.

37:43.459 --> 37:44.543
There's other people
in this prison,

37:44.627 --> 37:46.587
not just the ones who drink
your goddamn Kool-Aid.

37:46.670 --> 37:50.758
Are you finished? You're
starting to sound finished.

37:58.682 --> 38:00.017
What, huh?

38:10.820 --> 38:11.946
We had fun as usual.

38:13.114 --> 38:14.364
It couldn't be any other way.

38:16.283 --> 38:18.494
The music was beautiful,
the weather was great.

38:19.620 --> 38:20.997
We had a lot of fun.

38:22.748 --> 38:24.207
Dimitri. So good to see you.

38:24.333 --> 38:25.626
Good to see you too.

38:26.710 --> 38:28.337
I didn't know to expect you.

38:28.420 --> 38:31.715
Wait a minute, you've got to have some
Khalva back there or something, no?

38:31.841 --> 38:35.678
Something sweet for us?
To go with the coffee?

38:44.436 --> 38:45.562
Of course.

38:45.813 --> 38:47.773
I'll do it now, right away.

38:53.779 --> 38:58.241
Anyway, our guy looked into the
government contracts thing.

38:58.367 --> 38:59.493
Schools, hospitals.

38:59.618 --> 39:00.744
Yeah?

39:00.870 --> 39:02.872
Looks like we'll be able
to work something out.

39:10.337 --> 39:14.383
To this motherfucking
wanker right here.

39:14.550 --> 39:15.759
Here we go.

39:15.885 --> 39:20.597
To the first of many articles in
world-class publishing and the like.

39:20.890 --> 39:25.268
After this comes the book deal,
and then the movie deal,

39:25.561 --> 39:29.773
and then the inevitable
sexual harassment scandal.

39:32.776 --> 39:34.570
Big-time newspaperman.

39:35.905 --> 39:36.864
Salud!

39:36.947 --> 39:37.948
Salud!

39:38.199 --> 39:39.449
Cheers.
Salud.

39:39.575 --> 39:40.743
Cheers.

39:42.369 --> 39:44.538
Thank you. Thank you, guys.

39:45.706 --> 39:46.874
Mmm.

39:51.962 --> 39:53.296
It's my shout.

39:54.840 --> 39:56.175
You having an okay time?

39:57.342 --> 40:01.471
What? Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Of course.

40:03.724 --> 40:07.228
This is great.
Really, Polly, thank you.

40:07.310 --> 40:09.230
This is awesome.

40:09.312 --> 40:11.440
It must be hard without her.

40:11.523 --> 40:12.566
You have no idea.

40:12.649 --> 40:14.193
She'd want you to have
a good time, I'm sure.

40:14.276 --> 40:15.778
Yeah, I know.

40:15.861 --> 40:17.780
Doesn't make it any easier, though.
Right.

40:17.863 --> 40:19.281
Probably makes it harder.

40:19.406 --> 40:20.824
Bingo.

40:23.452 --> 40:26.038
I know I should be
feeling thrilled right now.

40:26.663 --> 40:31.418
I'm in print, I'm young-ish.

40:32.253 --> 40:35.505
And I'm healthy. Also "ish."

40:37.424 --> 40:43.513
I'm alive. I'm a living, breathing
thing, and it's really...

40:43.639 --> 40:45.808
It's overwhelming
how lucky I am.

40:47.559 --> 40:51.063
But yet every night
I go to bed,

40:51.897 --> 40:53.690
and I have this
gnawing feeling.

40:53.816 --> 40:56.693
Like what I've
got is not enough.

40:57.611 --> 40:59.931
And every morning I wake up
thinking the feeling'll be gone,

40:59.989 --> 41:02.866
but it's not.

41:05.535 --> 41:08.664
Does that make me a selfish,

41:08.747 --> 41:12.668
fucking ungrateful douche bag?

41:14.670 --> 41:15.963
Larry, honey...

41:16.046 --> 41:17.047
Hmm?

41:17.673 --> 41:18.924
Take me to the hospital.

41:19.508 --> 41:21.677
Now? Now?
Now.

41:23.720 --> 41:25.639
This fiance of yours...

41:25.889 --> 41:27.432
Hmm?

41:28.100 --> 41:30.186
What's it like when
he comes to visit?

41:30.644 --> 41:31.979
It's good.

41:36.650 --> 41:38.194
It's weird.

41:42.031 --> 41:46.035
Sometimes it feels like
there's never enough time,

41:47.536 --> 41:49.371
and then sometimes

41:50.706 --> 41:52.791
it feels like

41:52.875 --> 41:56.295
there's actually too much.

41:56.712 --> 41:57.921
What do you mean by that?

41:58.088 --> 42:01.424
There's no menu, or basket
of bread on the table,

42:02.384 --> 42:04.178
or TV to glance at.

42:05.262 --> 42:09.308
It's just us,
looking at each other,

42:09.683 --> 42:11.393
which can be great.

42:12.853 --> 42:14.479
And it should be.

42:16.606 --> 42:18.275
But sometimes...

42:22.738 --> 42:25.532
You just need to look away.

42:30.246 --> 42:33.540
Someone told me that you
never have had a visitor.

42:36.459 --> 42:38.254
Can I ask why?

42:45.594 --> 42:47.930
I guess I just
had to look away.

42:57.231 --> 42:58.274
Larry?

42:59.275 --> 43:01.277
Hey. I'm just relaxing,
being normal.

43:01.402 --> 43:02.485
Reading about, uh...

43:04.738 --> 43:08.242
Piper, that's my rinsing cup. Piper,
you put a pee stick in my rinsing cup.

43:08.325 --> 43:09.826
Well, you put your
pee stick in my vagina.

43:09.952 --> 43:11.472
And that's why
we're in this situation.

43:11.536 --> 43:14.831
I love it when you call my
mighty staff a pee stick.

43:17.918 --> 43:19.878
I think I might want it.

43:21.838 --> 43:23.465
My mighty staff?

43:25.801 --> 43:27.094
Piper, there is no "it" yet.

43:27.177 --> 43:28.762
I know. But if there is...

43:32.141 --> 43:33.683
You're going to prison
in three months.

43:33.809 --> 43:35.689
I know. I could be pregnant
while I'm in prison.

43:35.811 --> 43:37.354
What else am I
gonna be doing in there?

43:37.479 --> 43:39.982
How did we go from
not talking about kids at all

43:40.107 --> 43:41.317
to starting a prison family?

43:41.483 --> 43:43.764
People are always saying that
there's never a perfect time.

43:43.819 --> 43:47.697
Okay, I'm not sure that
our current situation applies here.

43:50.826 --> 43:52.911
Are we at least gonna
talk about other options?

43:54.997 --> 43:55.998
You mean...

43:56.581 --> 43:59.251
It's not Voldemort.
You can say it. Abortion.

43:59.835 --> 44:00.836
Oh.

44:00.961 --> 44:04.465
Look, not... Okay, not that
I'd insist, Piper. Okay? I...

44:05.257 --> 44:08.260
Your body, yourself.
It's a wonderland.

44:08.344 --> 44:09.845
I just...

44:11.096 --> 44:13.432
I'm just... I'm still
stuck in the mindset

44:13.515 --> 44:15.976
that I've been in
for so long. I don't...

44:16.185 --> 44:18.645
Like when Polly
and Pete told us,

44:19.355 --> 44:22.191
I felt panicked for them
before I remembered

44:22.316 --> 44:24.117
that people actually want
to get pregnant now.

44:24.193 --> 44:26.153
So you're saying
that you don't want it.

44:27.529 --> 44:30.157
I want to have a family with you, Piper.
Of course.

44:30.240 --> 44:32.742
So, listen. You know
all those conversations

44:32.868 --> 44:37.539
that we've had about making
my time in there meaningful?

44:39.458 --> 44:42.752
Well, we could, we could
start a new future now,

44:42.878 --> 44:43.879
instead of waiting.

44:45.797 --> 44:47.757
Piper,
the baby would come home,

44:47.883 --> 44:49.885
and you would still be in jail.

44:52.553 --> 44:55.891
Let's see what the pee stick
has to say about this.

45:06.735 --> 45:08.111
I feel sad.

45:10.489 --> 45:12.324
I feel sad that you feel sad.

45:22.292 --> 45:25.586
He's beautiful.
I mean, I don't know.

45:25.670 --> 45:28.173
That's what you're supposed to say, right?
It's a baby.

45:28.257 --> 45:29.417
You have to say it's amazing.

45:29.425 --> 45:30.633
I mean, you can't say,

45:30.759 --> 45:32.593
"It's amazing how much he
looks like John Goodman."

45:32.677 --> 45:34.930
Okay, so tell me everything.
From the very beginning.

45:35.055 --> 45:36.098
You got Polly into the...

45:36.181 --> 45:37.849
I got Polly in,
she's changing into her gown,

45:37.933 --> 45:39.059
and she's like,
"Where's Pete?" Yes.

45:39.142 --> 45:40.269
"Where the hell is Pete?"

45:40.352 --> 45:43.355
So I go out and he's not in the
waiting room, he's not in the lobby.

45:43.439 --> 45:46.691
I look outside. He is...
He's on the ground, Piper.

45:46.775 --> 45:49.736
He's on the fucking pavement,
wrestling with the cab driver.

45:49.861 --> 45:51.029
Jesus!

45:51.154 --> 45:52.281
Yeah. He left his
credit card at the bar.

45:52.406 --> 45:55.616
And I can't pay the guy, 'cause of
course Pete had done his whole,

45:55.742 --> 45:58.245
you know, "Don't bring a cent.
Your money's no good here.

45:58.328 --> 45:59.580
"Tonight is your night, mate,"

45:59.662 --> 46:02.958
so I had to let the guy run the
meter until Polly's dad got there.

46:03.041 --> 46:06.086
And Polly's dad
rolled his eyes, 'cause...

46:06.169 --> 46:07.754
Of course he rolled
his fucking eyes!

46:07.837 --> 46:09.965
And I'm like, "P.S., dickhead,
I just saved your grandchild

46:10.090 --> 46:11.967
"from being born
on a gin-soaked

46:12.134 --> 46:13.969
"shuffleboard table.
You're welcome."

46:14.094 --> 46:15.636
Did she get the extra stitch?

46:16.805 --> 46:17.889
I don't know what that is.

46:17.973 --> 46:20.058
But everyone was
asking about you, Pipes.

46:20.142 --> 46:21.935
I mean, everyone at the bar.

46:22.018 --> 46:24.521
Literally every
chance they got.

46:24.645 --> 46:26.231
People like you, Piper Chapman.

46:27.648 --> 46:28.817
Even people that
haven't met you.

46:28.900 --> 46:31.278
One of Polly's friends? She said
she felt like she knows you

46:31.361 --> 46:33.405
because of how well
I captured your spirit.

46:36.992 --> 46:38.785
She doesn't know me.

46:41.830 --> 46:44.374
That girl that you wrote about?
That's not me.

46:44.500 --> 46:45.834
What do you mean?

46:50.964 --> 46:52.341
Nothing.

46:55.344 --> 46:58.096
Do you think that I'm a
narcissist or a horse's ass?

46:58.180 --> 47:01.682
What? No, of course not.
Why would you say that?

47:05.020 --> 47:06.771
I missed your party.

47:09.690 --> 47:12.319
I couldn't get the dryer open.

47:13.111 --> 47:16.532
And I wasn't there when my
best friend had her baby.

47:18.450 --> 47:20.202
It's just shitty.

47:23.830 --> 47:25.040
I know.

47:58.281 --> 47:59.324
I got her.

48:08.083 --> 48:10.168
Come on, honey.
You're not alone.

48:48.039 --> 48:49.499
This room is for prayer.

48:49.625 --> 48:50.917
Never heard of it.

48:52.544 --> 48:53.836
We need to talk.

48:58.883 --> 49:01.136
Heard about your old roommate.

49:01.219 --> 49:03.846
Sent down to seg,
and an extended sentence.

49:03.972 --> 49:05.307
It's a raw deal.

49:06.099 --> 49:07.183
Yeah.

49:09.311 --> 49:11.563
I got a couple questions
that I need to ask you.

49:11.647 --> 49:13.649
I think you may know
the answers to 'em.

49:13.774 --> 49:16.901
About Red and the way
that she runs her business.

49:23.366 --> 49:26.161
And I would think that a smart,
savvy person like yourself

49:26.286 --> 49:27.663
would know an opportunity...

49:27.746 --> 49:29.205
Neptune's Produce.

49:29.414 --> 49:31.667
You wanna know how she
gets the contraband in?

49:31.792 --> 49:35.003
That's it.
Now leave me the fuck alone.

49:48.183 --> 49:50.185
Reminder, ladies,

49:50.352 --> 49:52.354
to wash your hands,
and do not share towels.

49:53.188 --> 49:55.732
Clean ladies are
healthy ladies.

50:00.696 --> 50:02.238
I know, right?
All right.

50:02.364 --> 50:03.990
Later.

50:15.794 --> 50:17.253
What's up, T?

50:22.008 --> 50:23.426
Yo, we gotta get some hot sauce

50:23.552 --> 50:24.927
in this bitch,
like you said, man.

50:25.053 --> 50:27.514
Tapatio, Texas Pete...
Shit, I don't even care.

50:28.807 --> 50:30.809
Yo, if that shit
don't come through soon,

50:30.933 --> 50:32.893
you gotta start
filibustin' the WAC.

50:33.019 --> 50:34.771
I heard back from the board.

50:37.440 --> 50:39.984
Yo, T, them motherfuckers don't know shit.
You know that.

50:40.068 --> 50:41.528
I'm getting out.

50:44.113 --> 50:45.323
Wait, you ain't playin'?

50:45.532 --> 50:46.533
No.

50:49.910 --> 50:51.329
Tays!

50:53.749 --> 50:55.166
Oh, my...

51:03.341 --> 51:05.343
Mail delivery will be delayed

51:05.468 --> 51:07.470
as letters are being
screened for anthrax.

51:08.221 --> 51:10.766
So, you have
experience in kitchens.

51:11.600 --> 51:13.309
Food preparation?

51:15.144 --> 51:16.937
Some experience. Yes.

51:17.938 --> 51:20.108
Maybe we can get
you a job in here.

51:20.233 --> 51:23.445
You know, Angie, our last cook,
she's no longer with us.

51:23.528 --> 51:24.945
She got out?

51:26.114 --> 51:28.324
Yeah, something like that.

51:31.453 --> 51:32.953
Romano?

51:37.417 --> 51:39.001
Reznikov.
Red.

51:39.628 --> 51:41.588
Show her the ropes tomorrow.

51:41.671 --> 51:43.465
I look forward to it.

51:54.810 --> 51:57.437
Okay. Let me show
you around over here.

52:16.498 --> 52:17.791
Got a minute there, cowboy?

52:17.874 --> 52:18.999
Everything okay?

52:19.125 --> 52:23.003
Of course it is. We just gotta
have a little talk, you and me.

52:35.141 --> 52:36.518
Go ahead.

52:48.697 --> 52:49.865
You sick, too?

52:52.408 --> 52:53.535
Oh.

52:54.536 --> 52:56.412
Yeah, it got me a day late.

52:56.913 --> 52:58.080
Sorry.

53:03.879 --> 53:06.422
What, are you a vampire now?
Do you need an invitation?

53:08.758 --> 53:10.385
Not too close, though.
I'm contagious.

53:10.510 --> 53:12.303
I know.

53:17.559 --> 53:21.563
I'm plotting my revenge on that
redneck fucking Deliverance extra.

53:21.688 --> 53:23.231
If you want in.

53:23.481 --> 53:24.649
Maybe.

53:28.361 --> 53:30.947
You seem depressed.
Even for prison.

53:33.324 --> 53:35.493
You know, if you ever
wanna talk about it,

53:35.618 --> 53:37.829
that's what
the counselors are for.

53:45.003 --> 53:48.339
Personally, I went on sad
drugs when I got here,

53:48.423 --> 53:50.008
and they worked for a while,

53:50.090 --> 53:52.761
but now I just cheek 'em and
trade 'em for black eyeliner.

53:56.096 --> 53:58.266
They make me constipated.

53:58.516 --> 54:02.311
I would rather shit and cry than
strain and nap all the time.

54:05.273 --> 54:06.775
What's wrong?

54:07.692 --> 54:08.735
Really.

54:10.110 --> 54:12.112
He wrote an article about me.

54:12.238 --> 54:13.615
The fiance?
Mmm-hmm.

54:15.283 --> 54:17.077
"One Sentence,
Two Prisoners."

54:17.159 --> 54:18.286
Oh, it's a terrible title.

54:18.411 --> 54:19.537
I know.

54:19.704 --> 54:22.540
And I'm happy for him,
but he got...

54:23.416 --> 54:27.879
He got so much of it so wrong.

54:30.673 --> 54:32.926
I'm not somebody's girlfriend.

54:35.929 --> 54:39.724
I'm not some cool story at a
yuppie fucking cocktail party.

54:39.808 --> 54:42.644
"You did a year in the Peace Corps?
I did a year in prison."

54:43.227 --> 54:44.854
Fuck, no!

54:45.187 --> 54:47.273
Those things we did,
you and me,

54:47.398 --> 54:49.484
that wasn't adventure
or a romp.

54:56.616 --> 54:58.409
That was my life.

55:04.082 --> 55:05.541
You want me to kill him?

55:08.878 --> 55:11.714
I may be a sick lesbian
in a prison bunk,

55:11.840 --> 55:14.467
but I got a couple tricks up my sleeve.

55:16.552 --> 55:18.346
Ugh.

55:19.014 --> 55:21.390
I feel like I am
missing so much.

55:25.353 --> 55:26.562
Me, too.

55:47.042 --> 55:48.584
Why are you making that face?

55:56.092 --> 55:57.343
Shit.

56:08.228 --> 56:11.607
I brought you this.
In case you throw up.

56:12.274 --> 56:14.819
Keep it there
till you feel better.

56:14.944 --> 56:16.029
Thanks.

56:18.406 --> 56:20.200
She have the baby?
Yeah.

56:20.950 --> 56:22.410
11:53 p.m.

56:22.827 --> 56:25.830
Some blanca guesser
bitch won the Twix.

56:35.131 --> 56:36.298
How are you feeling?

56:37.425 --> 56:38.467
Fine.

56:39.677 --> 56:41.971
Everyone else seems
to be getting over it.

56:42.097 --> 56:44.432
I should be back
to normal soon.

56:45.433 --> 56:46.976
You ain't got what
everybody else has.

56:47.102 --> 56:48.310
How do you know?

56:48.436 --> 56:50.939
'Cause your tits
are popping out of your shirt.

56:51.022 --> 56:53.816
Same shit happened to me
every fuckin' time.

56:53.942 --> 56:55.193
Every time what?

56:56.986 --> 56:58.613
You'll feel better
in nine months.
