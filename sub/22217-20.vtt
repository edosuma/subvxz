[narrator]
<i>Previously on </i> Dynasty:

00:13.430 --> 00:17.767
You're not the firstborn Carrington,
Steven. There was a baby boy.

00:17.851 --> 00:19.978
His name was Adam. He was kidnapped.

00:20.061 --> 00:22.897
I have hired investigators, psychics,
anything.

00:22.981 --> 00:27.152
-Anything to find a trace.
-He thought Adam might be in El Paso.

00:27.235 --> 00:30.780
He tracked one of the suspected
kidnappers here. John Miller.

00:30.864 --> 00:34.534
[Joseph] If Culhane realizes the
connection between his father's disease

00:34.617 --> 00:37.787
and what CA covered up,
it may not be easy to handle.

00:37.871 --> 00:42.667
At Carrington Atlantic, I killed a story
about the Clarke County health crisis.

00:42.751 --> 00:45.503
[Blake] <i>Even though you knew</i>
<i>CA was making people sick?</i>

00:45.587 --> 00:47.338
[Cristal]
<i>I was trying to do my job.</i>

00:47.422 --> 00:50.884
You wanted me on the record
to blackmail me into silence.

00:50.967 --> 00:55.138
Let's get you back on your feet.
We have work to do.

01:03.313 --> 01:05.982
What happened
to your vegetarian diet, Fallon?

01:06.066 --> 01:07.650
That was so 2005.

01:07.734 --> 01:10.653
-Fallon, you're up early.
-And suspiciously peppy.

01:10.737 --> 01:13.073
-Morning.
-[Fallon] Jeff's picking me up.

01:13.156 --> 01:14.991
-Colby?
-The very.

01:15.658 --> 01:18.328
He's taking me to the winter dance
on Friday.

01:23.083 --> 01:23.917
What?

01:25.293 --> 01:29.339
It's just so last-minute.
We'll have to get you the perfect dress.

01:30.173 --> 01:34.385
-Anders, would you call the seamstress?
-I'll have her come tomorrow.

01:34.469 --> 01:35.762
[cell phone chimes]

01:36.346 --> 01:37.764
Gotta go. Jeff's here.

01:42.560 --> 01:43.686
[Jeff]
You're still here?

01:43.770 --> 01:47.899
Back, actually, with sustenance.
You still like honey on your biscuits?

01:47.982 --> 01:52.779
I don't need your pity or your help.
You can't come in here like you know me.

01:52.862 --> 01:55.657
I have known you
since you were 13 years old.

01:55.740 --> 01:59.869
You haven't seen me in 11.
Does Fallon even know you're here?

01:59.953 --> 02:01.704
No, that wouldn't be helpful.

02:02.622 --> 02:06.167
And despite your scene
at the trunk show the other night,

02:06.793 --> 02:10.505
I know you weren't trying to hurt her.
You care about her.

02:11.131 --> 02:13.716
You think this is about Fallon?

02:13.800 --> 02:17.512
You think I'm trying to get back with her?
I lost my family.

02:17.595 --> 02:21.641
And I wanna help you get them back.
I just wanna see you happy again.

02:21.724 --> 02:23.685
After everything that's happened,

02:23.768 --> 02:28.439
I don't need to see another Carrington
as long as I live, and that includes you.

02:28.523 --> 02:30.233
You can see yourself out now.

02:34.445 --> 02:36.114
[Sammy Jo]
Be completely honest.

02:36.197 --> 02:39.200
What says "forever" better,
eggshell or ivory?

02:39.284 --> 02:42.912
-Forever is a fantasy.
-Unlike your wedding, ours is real.

02:42.996 --> 02:46.791
I want it to be perfect.
It'd be a lot easier if Steven was here.

02:46.875 --> 02:49.002
He's only in D.C. for a few days.

02:49.085 --> 02:53.214
When he's back, he'll be dying to talk
about napkins and place settings

02:53.298 --> 02:57.010
and all the things you think
will ensure your eternal happiness.

02:58.344 --> 03:00.972
-I haven't tasted those yet.
-I'm saving you.

03:01.055 --> 03:03.349
Don't wanna pop a button on your suit.

03:06.311 --> 03:09.105
Mrs. Gunnerson has been busy.

03:09.647 --> 03:12.442
I said I wanted the crepe cake
that Oprah likes.

03:12.525 --> 03:15.570
I'd be happy to sort out
your wedding arrangements.

03:15.653 --> 03:18.740
I've been planning events
since before you were born.

03:18.823 --> 03:20.909
Why doesn't anyone get it, Anders?

03:21.701 --> 03:24.537
I want this to be different
from anything before.

03:24.621 --> 03:29.042
Yet, you pick a cake recommended by
the most influential woman in the world.

03:29.125 --> 03:30.209
-Yeah.
-[chuckles]

03:31.252 --> 03:33.171
What else did you have in mind?

03:33.254 --> 03:34.839
Oh, I completely forgot.

03:34.923 --> 03:37.592
Would you pick up tea sandwiches
from Henri's?

03:37.675 --> 03:40.220
-For Colby? We're going back there?
-No, no.

03:40.303 --> 03:42.805
If I play my cards right,
he'll come to me.

03:44.557 --> 03:47.894
-Why are you behind enemy lines?
-Is that your breakfast?

03:47.977 --> 03:49.103
Don't judge me.

03:49.187 --> 03:52.690
Have Mrs. Gunnerson pack it up,
and take it to the hospital.

03:52.774 --> 03:57.487
Culhane's mother was clear I stay away.
Tiny confections won't change her mind.

03:57.570 --> 04:01.032
Mothers usually know best,
but we're not always right.

04:01.115 --> 04:05.370
Though my record's better than most.
I did have a sixth sense about Liam.

04:05.453 --> 04:07.080
I knew you'd slip that in there.

04:07.163 --> 04:10.124
I have one about Michael, too.
A good kind.

04:10.208 --> 04:13.419
-Don't push it.
-I just wanna see you happy again.

04:13.503 --> 04:17.714
And if that means being with Culhane,
then don't let anything stop you.

04:31.562 --> 04:33.439
[indistinct chatter over PA]

04:34.023 --> 04:36.985
Fallon. What are you doing here?

04:37.402 --> 04:40.363
I thought you could use a break
from hospital food,

04:40.446 --> 04:44.075
so I had Mrs. Gunnerson make
your favorite, chocolate ganache.

04:44.158 --> 04:48.079
-You could've had it delivered.
-I wanted to know how you were.

04:48.162 --> 04:51.207
-Don't look so surprised.
-That's one word for it.

04:51.291 --> 04:54.252
I know I haven't always been
a traditional friend,

04:54.335 --> 04:57.463
but I wanna make it up to you.
Let me be here for you.

04:59.507 --> 05:00.341
[sighs]

05:00.800 --> 05:04.220
I appreciate the food,
and what Cristal's done for my dad,

05:04.804 --> 05:07.682
but I didn't bring you into this
for a reason.

05:08.349 --> 05:11.602
-I just need to focus on my family now.
-Cristal?

05:11.686 --> 05:14.188
Yeah. I don't know
what strings she pulled, but she got my father
into a clinical trial

05:16.858 --> 05:19.485
-and doctors are optimistic.
-That's great.

05:19.569 --> 05:21.821
Best news we've got since he got sick.

05:24.824 --> 05:25.658
Um...

05:25.867 --> 05:28.369
Anyway,
I should probably get back inside.

05:29.037 --> 05:30.705
Thank Mrs. Gunnerson for me?

05:38.212 --> 05:41.507
I wanna follow up with Legal
on that contract language.

05:43.968 --> 05:46.804
Fallon. This is a surprise.

05:47.388 --> 05:50.475
So is the fact you're meddling
with Culhane's family.

05:50.558 --> 05:52.852
You got his dad into a clinical trial?

05:57.440 --> 05:59.525
I'm sorry I didn't tell you sooner.

06:02.236 --> 06:05.364
He isn't the only person
that's sick in Clarke County.

06:06.157 --> 06:07.784
CA has a power plant there.

06:07.867 --> 06:12.121
There's been waste-disposal issues,
potential contamination of the water.

06:12.205 --> 06:14.624
-My dad knew?
-For years. We did this to Culhane's father?

06:18.586 --> 06:23.341
We didn't know. When I put it together,
I told him he had to fix it.

06:23.424 --> 06:26.135
Clean up the plant, pay for medical care.

06:26.219 --> 06:28.638
-But he won't.
-That'd be admitting guilt.

06:28.721 --> 06:32.725
He arranged a deposition.
He has a recording of me admitting fault.

06:32.809 --> 06:35.728
He threatened to blackmail me
if I came forward.

06:36.896 --> 06:40.566
But I'm going public,
even if it blows up my marriage.

06:41.150 --> 06:44.278
We're finally on the same page.
I'm kidding. Okay.

06:44.862 --> 06:47.490
We need to shut down
the Clarke County plant,

06:47.865 --> 06:49.534
and deal with Daddy.

06:49.617 --> 06:52.286
-How?
-He was in that deposition, too?

06:52.370 --> 06:54.831
Get the recording
and we'll have leverage.

06:54.914 --> 06:56.958
We force him to do the right thing.

06:57.041 --> 07:00.253
But we'll have to do this my way.
Do you trust me?

07:00.336 --> 07:01.212
Honestly?

07:01.295 --> 07:03.589
Let me restate that. You have to trust me.

07:11.431 --> 07:15.226
I'm thinking if we work together
and get the recorder,

07:15.309 --> 07:18.980
-we can go to him and present--
-I've looked for that recorder.

07:19.063 --> 07:21.607
I scoured Blake's study.
I couldn't find it.

07:21.691 --> 07:25.778
It's not where you can snoop.
It'll be on the other side of this wall.

07:25.862 --> 07:28.781
-In his office?
-He has a safe in his desk drawer.

07:28.865 --> 07:32.452
-I found it when I was 7.
-It'd be easier to go to the press.

07:32.535 --> 07:37.206
How can I stay silent about a potential
Erin Brockovich-level situation?

07:37.290 --> 07:39.709
You go kamikaze, there's no pulling back.

07:39.792 --> 07:44.046
Hopefully the threat of mutual destruction
is enough to turn this around.

07:44.755 --> 07:49.135
-Do you know the code to the safe?
-One of them. It's my birthday, obvi.

07:49.218 --> 07:53.389
But a second rolling code generates
every five minutes on his phone.

07:53.473 --> 07:56.100
If you can get that,
I can get into the safe.

07:56.184 --> 07:59.479
We're barely speaking.
I'm not able to get to his phone.

07:59.562 --> 08:03.107
I'm sure you can find a way.
I just don't wanna picture how.

08:03.191 --> 08:04.025
[sighs]

08:04.984 --> 08:09.989
I like what you've done with the place.
Last time I was here, it wasn't for tea.

08:11.032 --> 08:13.534
I'm surprised
they let me on the property.

08:13.618 --> 08:14.911
Don't be silly.

08:14.994 --> 08:19.165
You've always been part of this family.
You're like a daughter to me.

08:19.248 --> 08:23.586
And you've really grown out
of your awkward stage, haven't you?

08:23.669 --> 08:26.923
-You ever thought of modeling?
-No.

08:27.465 --> 08:30.843
Mm. It seems like you've done so well
for yourself.

08:31.260 --> 08:33.763
Wish I could say the same
for your brother.

08:33.846 --> 08:34.679
You saw Jeff?

08:34.764 --> 08:38.392
To be honest, that's why I called you.
I'm worried about him.

08:38.476 --> 08:42.270
He brought this on himself.
My father and I are fine without him.

08:42.480 --> 08:46.108
Dad finishes house arrest this week.
He'll finally be free.

08:46.734 --> 08:50.530
Well, maybe that's even more reason
to reach out to Jeff.

08:51.113 --> 08:54.283
He's made a lot of mistakes,
but he's paying for them.

08:54.867 --> 08:57.828
He's hurting, Monica.
He wants to make it right.

08:58.621 --> 09:03.709
You missed a lot. The things Jeff's said
and done trying to get revenge on Blake

09:04.168 --> 09:08.506
is turning him into the man he hates.
Everyone has a version of the story.

09:08.589 --> 09:11.968
I don't know who to believe,
or what started this war.

09:12.051 --> 09:15.846
-Fallon wants to go to the dance with me.
-I'm sure she does.

09:15.930 --> 09:20.476
-We'll be home by 11:30 if you're worried.
-You know I think highly of you.

09:20.560 --> 09:22.687
-Then what's the problem?
-[Blake sighs]

09:22.770 --> 09:26.357
The foundation scholarship can't look
like we play favorites.

09:26.440 --> 09:29.402
It wouldn't reflect well
on the foundation, or you.

09:29.485 --> 09:32.572
I'm almost done at Penley.
I've been accepted to MIT.

09:32.655 --> 09:37.702
We wouldn't wanna jeopardize that,
would we? Or your sister's scholarship.

09:39.412 --> 09:41.789
-Is that a threat?
-It's just a reality.

09:42.373 --> 09:44.041
I'm trying to help you.

09:46.043 --> 09:47.253
You understand?

09:55.052 --> 09:56.178
I got it.

10:00.933 --> 10:02.935
Your brother isn't Blake.

10:03.019 --> 10:06.022
Blake's always wanted
to tear your family apart,

10:06.105 --> 10:08.649
and now he's gone
and done exactly that.

10:08.733 --> 10:10.067
We can't let him win.

10:11.819 --> 10:13.779
-You were looking for me?
-[band playing]

10:14.322 --> 10:17.867
They do the classics,
in English and in Spanish.

10:17.950 --> 10:22.580
And instead of a traditional wedding
cake, a custom crepe bar,

10:22.663 --> 10:24.999
with signature his-and-his combination.

10:25.082 --> 10:29.629
And for cocktail hour, we'll fly in Jiro
from Tokyo for a selection of sushi

10:29.712 --> 10:32.965
to be passed around
by these fine gentlemen.

10:33.049 --> 10:36.177
-Uh, it's a little gay stereotype--
-What's that?

10:37.136 --> 10:38.679
[band stops playing]

10:38.763 --> 10:39.597
Thank you.

10:39.680 --> 10:45.853
I appreciate what you're trying to do,
but this just isn't what I imagined.

10:45.936 --> 10:50.441
-You don't like sushi? Steven does.
-I'm supposed to be doing this with him.

10:50.524 --> 10:54.945
Is this what marrying a rich guy is like?
He assumes you're a house husband?

10:55.029 --> 10:56.238
Him away on business,

10:56.322 --> 11:00.534
leaving me with the twins' runny noses
and gossipy private-school moms,

11:00.618 --> 11:04.121
till I get my real-estate license,
just to feel some purpose?

11:04.205 --> 11:05.039
[chuckles]

11:05.956 --> 11:09.168
To be fair, you've only been engaged
for two weeks.

11:09.585 --> 11:12.380
Slow down.
Forget about the wedding for a while.

11:12.463 --> 11:15.007
You should be together,
so be together.

11:15.091 --> 11:20.179
-In D.C.? Not exactly a romantic getaway.
-Nothing more romantic than a surprise.

11:21.013 --> 11:25.476
-I don't know where he's staying.
-I'll take care of it. Go and pack a bag.

11:27.478 --> 11:28.479
Two, three, four.

11:28.562 --> 11:30.189
[playing]

11:39.240 --> 11:40.366
[Valerie]
No soliciting.

11:44.412 --> 11:46.163
I said, not interested!

11:47.039 --> 11:51.210
Sorry to disturb you. I'm trying to get
in touch with your brother, John Miller?

11:51.293 --> 11:54.588
[baby crying]

11:56.465 --> 11:59.385
[baby continues crying]

11:59.468 --> 12:04.014
-You just woke up my baby. You happy?
-I'm sorry. I'm looking for my brother,

12:04.098 --> 12:07.768
-and yours might know where he is.
-How'd you get my address?

12:07.852 --> 12:12.189
I went to John's last apartment.
The tenant said he forwarded mail here.

12:12.273 --> 12:15.443
-That was a long time ago.
-So, he doesn't live here?

12:15.526 --> 12:18.529
If he did,
I'd have sent him to get formula,

12:18.612 --> 12:21.866
and maybe I'd be at the spa
getting my toenails painted.

12:21.949 --> 12:24.910
This isn't his address.
I don't have time for this.

12:24.994 --> 12:28.122
If I could get a--
If I could just get a phone number?

12:37.465 --> 12:38.299
[Blake]
Ah.

12:38.757 --> 12:41.677
I thought you were out.
I just need some clothes.

12:42.428 --> 12:44.180
-Can we talk?
-I'm busy.

12:44.805 --> 12:47.057
Quarterly investors' meeting tomorrow.

12:48.100 --> 12:50.478
Besides, I said everything yesterday.

12:50.561 --> 12:54.315
I didn't appreciate your tone,
but you were right.

12:55.774 --> 12:58.736
We don't know what's going on
in Clarke County yet.

12:59.069 --> 13:03.908
It's irresponsible to jump to conclusions,
not just for your sake or the families',

13:03.991 --> 13:06.827
but for those who could get hurt
if this got out.

13:07.495 --> 13:12.416
-That's what I was trying to say.
-I know. I got scared and I overreacted.

13:13.334 --> 13:14.251
I'm sorry.

13:14.835 --> 13:17.421
We're in this together.
We should be a team.

13:17.505 --> 13:21.383
-I don't want this space between us.
-Neither do I.

13:22.092 --> 13:23.385
Can we start over?

13:42.821 --> 13:45.032
-What did you have in mind?
-Mm.

13:47.826 --> 13:50.496
Well, I was just about
to run a long, hot bath.

13:52.164 --> 13:53.123
It's a big tub.

13:54.708 --> 13:56.252
-I'll run it.
-Mm.

13:59.129 --> 14:00.464
I'll get some candles.

14:30.035 --> 14:33.914
Did you get my text? We have five
minutes before the code expires.

14:33.998 --> 14:37.751
Um... Slight hiccup.
We didn't factor in my dad's janitor.

14:37.835 --> 14:40.880
What? He's there?
Can you distract him or something?

14:40.963 --> 14:42.298
With what, cleavage?

14:42.381 --> 14:46.260
I don't tramp out like you.
I'll just wait till he leaves.

14:46.343 --> 14:50.180
No time. Blake will wonder
why it's taking so long to get candles.

14:50.264 --> 14:53.684
I don't wanna know
what 50 Shades of Gross you're doing.

14:53.767 --> 14:55.936
I'm not thrilled about this, either.

-Three minutes?

I don't need more grits.

Monica. [sighs]

16:30.531 --> 16:33.450
If you're here to say "I told you so,"
just leave.

16:33.534 --> 16:35.452
You said he was dying to see me.

16:35.536 --> 16:38.497
-Look at him.
-I'm right here. I'm doing just fine.

16:39.289 --> 16:42.626
Don't you have your own children
to meddle with?

16:42.710 --> 16:46.922
-Right, like you're living your best life?
-My life is not her business.

16:47.006 --> 16:51.927
He's right, this isn't about me. I'm just
happy to see you two in the same room.

16:52.011 --> 16:54.680
I remember when I first met you both,

16:55.097 --> 16:58.058
at the interview
for the CA Foundation Scholarship.

16:58.308 --> 17:03.105
You were so close. I can't imagine what
your mother would say about this rift.

17:03.188 --> 17:06.733
-That implies she thinks about us.
-Yeah, she's in New York.

17:07.984 --> 17:11.613
-Doing her own thing.
-Dad's ankle monitor comes off today.

17:11.696 --> 17:14.742
We're going to Rathman's
for lobster and steak.

17:14.825 --> 17:17.327
-Is that an invite?
-If you sober up.

17:18.078 --> 17:19.496
Jeff would love to go.

17:20.247 --> 17:26.170
He's too smart to let pride get in the way
of something that he wants so very much.

17:26.252 --> 17:27.253
Isn't that right?

17:30.090 --> 17:31.508
Of course I'll be there.

17:32.384 --> 17:34.887
-With bells on.
-See you tonight.

17:37.848 --> 17:41.185
See? You'll be one big,
happy family again in no time.

17:41.268 --> 17:43.854
Or one small,
slightly less messed-up family.

-[Jeff] Mrs. C.
-[Alexis] Jeff, why are you here?

17:49.109 --> 17:52.279
-Taking Fallon to the formal.
-We talked about this.

17:52.362 --> 17:54.364
I care about your daughter.

17:54.448 --> 17:57.701
I won't bail on her
because of her dad's politics.

17:57.785 --> 18:02.915
If Blake wants to take our scholarships
because of this dance, that's on him.

18:03.290 --> 18:06.794
I'll work as many jobs as it takes
to get us through school.

18:06.877 --> 18:09.630
So, bring it. I'm not scared.

18:12.466 --> 18:17.054
Jeff, I'm sorry, but Fallon just left
for the dance with Robby Reed.

18:21.308 --> 18:25.395
Guess I should've known. Stupidly
sprung for a limo and everything.

18:39.243 --> 18:43.038
-Was that Jeff?
-No. A delivery.

18:50.087 --> 18:53.715
No catty remark on how the dress
makes me look pear-shaped,

18:53.799 --> 18:57.094
-or that the color washes me out?
-You look divine.

18:57.761 --> 19:02.015
Good. Let's hope Jeff gets here
before I turn into a pumpkin.

19:05.769 --> 19:09.314
Thanks for looking out, Alexis.
You've done so much for us.

19:09.398 --> 19:12.609
I just want good things for you, Jeff.
And your sister.

19:13.402 --> 19:15.070
You both mean so much to me.

19:17.531 --> 19:21.535
I've been Googling D.C. styles.
Options seem limited to black, white,

19:21.618 --> 19:25.205
or I'd-rather-be-caught-dead khaki,
but I've narrowed it down

19:25.289 --> 19:31.420
to a Hyannis Port-era Kennedy look, or
an Obama post-presidency relaxed vibe.

19:31.503 --> 19:36.842
We have a bigger problem. I just called
Steven's hotel of choice, the Hay-Adams.

19:37.426 --> 19:39.261
-He's not a guest there.
-What?

19:39.928 --> 19:41.972
Is he staying under an alias?

19:42.598 --> 19:45.142
You don't think he's cheating on me,
do you?

19:45.225 --> 19:48.645
In my head, the gossipy school moms
already discussed this,

19:48.729 --> 19:52.941
-but I've defended him, so--
-Sam, stop. I don't think Steven's in D.C.

19:56.195 --> 19:59.948
Wherever John Miller is,
his sister didn't wanna tell me.

20:00.240 --> 20:03.994
-I did catch her at a bad time.
-Perhaps she's scared to talk.

20:04.077 --> 20:06.997
If his sister's spooked,
maybe this is a bad idea.

20:07.080 --> 20:11.752
I'm okay. I just... I understand now
how hard it's been for you.

20:11.835 --> 20:14.004
<i>The darkness and disappointments.</i>

20:14.421 --> 20:16.965
<i>But this Valerie woman</i>
<i>might know something.</i>

20:17.049 --> 20:19.885
It's more of a lead
than anything else I found.

20:19.968 --> 20:24.056
I can't be this close to Adam's
possible kidnapper and just walk away.

20:24.181 --> 20:25.265
[phone beeps]

20:28.852 --> 20:30.854
-Sam's calling.
-Have you told him?

20:30.938 --> 20:35.275
Not yet. He's too close to Fallon.
If Fallon finds out, then Dad might.

20:36.443 --> 20:38.820
Don't wanna give them
false expectations. I know that more than anyone. Be careful.

20:41.698 --> 20:42.574
I will.

-I brought entertainment.
-You are serious about this friend thing.

I figured I'd put my money
where my mouth is.

20:59.091 --> 21:03.220
-Or put my mouth where my money is.
-I don't even know what that means,

21:03.303 --> 21:06.014
but since my dad is sleeping right there,

21:06.682 --> 21:09.518
maybe we should just play Jenga.

21:09.601 --> 21:13.105
Okay. As long as you're prepared
to be decimated by my fine motor skills.

21:13.188 --> 21:14.022

You think I did it?
We had an agreement.

I'm not upset the truth is out,
people deserve to know,

-I didn't do it.
-I looked in the office safe.

23:02.798 --> 23:06.843
The deposition's gone. I'm guessing
your plan was to blow the whistle

23:06.927 --> 23:09.304
and then throw me under the bus.

23:09.387 --> 23:13.183
I'll admit I took the recording,
but I never spoke to the press.

-No one.

23:16.436 --> 23:20.524

looking and snuck into your office.

You got nothing on me.
You must've listened to it.

23:23.610 --> 23:27.697
-I deleted my portion of the confession.
-And you have nothing on me.

23:28.573 --> 23:30.117
I destroyed the recording.

Blackmail shouldn't be the foundation

I hope this helps.

[baby gurgling]

25:04.544 --> 25:07.088
I heard on the radio
you killed some people.

Is the dog to protect you
from angry villagers wielding pitchforks?

25:11.593 --> 25:14.846
We got Bo for the kids after you left,
as a replacement.

25:14.930 --> 25:18.475
Except, unlike you, he's loyal.
And sheds a lot less.

25:18.558 --> 25:21.686
-What do you want, Alexis?
-I've come to ask a favor.

25:21.770 --> 25:25.357
I'm not gonna take no for an answer,
especially not from you.

25:25.440 --> 25:29.736
Sounds like a line from the past.
I'm guessing it has to do with money.

25:29.819 --> 25:33.907
As you can see, I brought my bodyguard,
Mickey, back on staff.

25:33.990 --> 25:35.408
Your ex-Uber driver?

25:35.492 --> 25:37.994
It's only fitting that you pay his salary,

25:38.078 --> 25:40.872
-since you're the reason I need him.
-What?

25:40.956 --> 25:44.584
Jeff. He made a spectacle of himself
at the La Perla party.

25:44.668 --> 25:48.129
Would've gotten violent
if he hadn't vomited so thoroughly.

25:48.546 --> 25:53.260
Clearly, the family still has it out
for us. I'm worried about my safety.

25:53.343 --> 25:56.054
-I'm not worried about Jeff.
-Shouldn't you be?

25:56.638 --> 26:01.101
You and Fallon pushed him over
the edge. And it's not the first time.

26:01.226 --> 26:03.019
Our daughter is in tears...

26:03.937 --> 26:05.897
because she thinks
that Jeff stood her up.

26:06.481 --> 26:09.609
-You made me humiliate that child.
-I didn't make you.

26:09.693 --> 26:11.361
It all comes down to money.

26:11.695 --> 26:16.032
You would frame innocent men,
threaten children, destroy families.

26:16.116 --> 26:18.076
It's poisoning ours.

26:18.159 --> 26:21.705
Don't sit on your high horse.
You spend more than any of us.

26:21.788 --> 26:25.000
It's your fault.
I'm becoming you, and I'm sick of it.

26:25.083 --> 26:27.961
Since we lost Adam,
you don't care about anyone.

26:28.044 --> 26:29.546
Screw you, Alexis.

26:29.629 --> 26:33.216
One day all this is gonna come back
and bite you in the ass.

26:35.051 --> 26:38.305
You have been striking at that family
for over a decade.

26:38.388 --> 26:40.640
They're not gonna take it lying down.

26:40.724 --> 26:44.561
Jeff's not coming at us again.
Not after we handed his ass to him.

26:44.644 --> 26:48.898
So, no, I won't pay your bodyguard
to play Kevin Costner to your Whitney.

26:48.982 --> 26:52.861
It's... not just Jeff I'm worried about.

26:53.778 --> 26:54.612
It's Cecil.

26:57.532 --> 26:59.492
You took your time getting in.

26:59.576 --> 27:02.954
The water-contamination story
is spinning out of control.

27:03.538 --> 27:07.167
Our lawyers and PR team

and work on a counterattack.

27:11.755 --> 27:14.299
Going on the defensive
isn't what CA needs.

27:14.841 --> 27:19.637
Corporations face scandals all the time.
Can't go a day without exploding phones,

Ponzi schemes, a CEO's hooker habit.
We need to handle this the right way.

27:24.559 --> 27:26.102
And you know what that is?

27:26.186 --> 27:30.732
This is a chance to revamp CA's image
to a modern and socially conscious one.

27:30.815 --> 27:34.069
-Steven put you up to this?
-We cover medical expenses

27:34.152 --> 27:36.821
and distribute industrial-grade
water filters,

27:36.905 --> 27:39.949
residents agree to sign
a binding arbitration clause

27:40.033 --> 27:41.493
that caps our liability.

27:41.576 --> 27:44.662
We move the company
towards 100 percent clean energy,

27:44.746 --> 27:47.624
and we start by closing
the Clarke County plants.

27:47.707 --> 27:50.502
Next I drive a hybrid
and pay higher taxes?

27:50.585 --> 27:53.129
This will make us seem honest,
like we care.

27:53.213 --> 27:56.341
The positive image will help us
get business.

27:56.424 --> 28:00.011
There's no real evidence that CA caused
this water problem.

28:00.387 --> 28:01.930
Culhane's father is dying.

28:02.389 --> 28:05.767
Do you care? We have an opportunity
to do the right thing.

28:05.850 --> 28:09.187
CA will recover
and be stronger than ever.

28:09.270 --> 28:14.067
This isn't just about CA. The government
will start breathing down my neck

28:14.150 --> 28:18.655
the second we admit we made a mistake.
I could wind up in prison.

28:18.738 --> 28:21.491
The whole family could be
under investigation.

28:22.283 --> 28:25.787
I promised Michael.
He'll never speak to me again.

28:26.204 --> 28:31.751
I strongly urge you to consider
whether your feelings for Culhane

28:32.377 --> 28:35.380
are worth jeopardizing
our family's future.

28:40.719 --> 28:44.222
We're bringing in the falconers
to take care of the gophers.

28:44.305 --> 28:46.057
Steven wouldn't tell me where he is.

28:47.308 --> 28:49.936
He said it's complicated
and to trust him.

28:50.019 --> 28:52.605
Can you work your spy magic
to track him?

28:52.689 --> 28:56.276
Little early in your relationship
to resort to espionage.

28:56.359 --> 28:59.070
I come from a family of secrets and lies.

28:59.154 --> 29:02.699
"It's complicated" and "trust me"
are my trigger words.

29:03.158 --> 29:05.160
Marriage is a complicated journey.

29:06.244 --> 29:08.830
We just have to have faith
in our partners.

29:08.913 --> 29:13.126
-Did you get that off an Instagram feed?
-I got it from my own marriage.

29:14.043 --> 29:14.878
Whoa.

29:15.086 --> 29:19.424
You were married?
I'd always pictured you like a nun.

29:19.507 --> 29:22.469
But instead of Jesus,
you swore yourself to the Carringtons.

29:22.552 --> 29:27.265
Ah. Then... you might be even more
shocked to know that I have a daughter.

29:27.348 --> 29:30.894
My God, what is happening?
You've never mentioned a daughter.

29:30.977 --> 29:34.522
We haven't spoken in years.
Her name is Kirby.

29:34.898 --> 29:38.735
-She lives in Australia with her mother.
-You're giving up on her?

29:38.818 --> 29:42.447
-It's not exactly my choice.
-Then you can't let her miss out.

29:43.031 --> 29:46.951
Anders, you're a great parent.
Look at how well Steven turned out.

29:47.035 --> 29:50.997
And you've been much better to me
than my murdery, dead-again dad.

29:51.664 --> 29:53.166
Thanks. I think.

29:53.708 --> 29:57.796
Let me do my fatherly bit by telling you
what I wish I knew back then.

29:58.338 --> 30:03.426
A little faith might've saved my marriage,
and I might still be part of Kirby's life.

30:03.885 --> 30:07.013
I've known Steven since he was born.
He's a good one.

30:08.306 --> 30:09.641
He's worth your faith.

30:15.438 --> 30:18.233

Yes, yes.

30:20.819 --> 30:23.321
Thought this was the investors' meeting.

30:23.404 --> 30:26.407
Yeah, sure looks like
a surprise press conference.

30:26.491 --> 30:29.118
This must be about
the Clarke County scandal.

30:29.369 --> 30:31.579
Blake knows we stole the depositions.

30:31.663 --> 30:34.582
I covered for you.
I told him I took it myself.

30:34.666 --> 30:38.795
-But he thinks I leaked the story.
-I'm not gonna let him scapegoat you

30:38.878 --> 30:43.174
or deny CA's mistakes.
I made a promise to you and to Culhane.

30:43.258 --> 30:47.470
So, if my dad tries anything,
I'll grab the mic and Kanye him.

30:47.554 --> 30:49.180
-I'll back you up, too.
-No.

30:49.264 --> 30:52.016
I'm his daughter.
I can afford to take a hit.

30:52.559 --> 30:55.061
-Your marriage, on the other hand...

30:56.271 --> 30:58.314
[Cristal]
Okay, guess it's time to start.

31:02.235 --> 31:06.781
As CEO of Carrington Atlantic,
I am here to set the record straight.

31:07.407 --> 31:11.286
Clarke County has always played
an important role here at CA.

31:11.369 --> 31:14.539
<i>It saddens me to hear</i>
<i>some of its residents are ill.</i>

31:14.622 --> 31:18.042

<i>no quantitative proof</i>

31:18.126 --> 31:21.671
<i>linking CA's operations</i>
<i>to water contamination,</i>

31:21.754 --> 31:24.883
and we have always taken
stringent precautions

31:24.966 --> 31:27.176
to protect our local communities.

31:28.678 --> 31:33.349
But this media storm offers us a chance

31:33.433 --> 31:37.687
to address an exciting change
that we're making here at CA.

31:37.979 --> 31:41.274
Carrington Atlantic is moving
towards clean energy.

31:41.733 --> 31:45.570
I shut down work in Clarke County today
to accommodate this shift.

31:46.154 --> 31:48.907
I'm appointing my daughter,
Fallon Carrington,

31:48.990 --> 31:51.618
who started a clean-energy company
last year,

31:51.701 --> 31:53.912
to spearhead this initiative. Fallon?

[camera shutters clicking]

31:59.584 --> 32:00.585
[sighs]

32:00.668 --> 32:01.961
Come on, Fallon.

32:02.045 --> 32:06.799
Moving forward, her company, Morell
Corp., will be fully absorbed into CA,

32:06.883 --> 32:10.803
as she steps into her role
as Carrington Atlantic's new COO.

32:12.096 --> 32:14.599
-[camera shutters clicking]
-[crowd murmuring]

32:14.849 --> 32:17.060
My wife, Cristal, is stepping down

32:17.143 --> 32:20.605
from day-to-day operations indefinitely
to focus on family.

32:22.023 --> 32:25.818
We are in agreement
that Fallon is the perfect replacement.

32:26.361 --> 32:29.656
Miss Carrington,
how do you feel about your new role?

32:29.739 --> 32:30.573
Um...

32:31.282 --> 32:33.076
-Come on.
-[Fallon] <i> It, uh...</i>

32:34.827 --> 32:38.164
Well, it's all happening so fast.
[chuckles]

32:38.373 --> 32:41.918
I'm of course thrilled
to be working with my dad again.

32:42.001 --> 32:43.920
<i>Well, she means "for" her dad.</i>
[chuckles]

32:44.003 --> 32:46.881
<i>But this has been her dream</i>

32:55.473 --> 32:57.517
-Michael?
-What's going on?

32:57.600 --> 33:01.479
You should call the rest of your family.
Something's happened.

33:03.564 --> 33:05.108
[knocking on door]

33:07.610 --> 33:11.864
I came when I got your message.
Why aren't you at the celebration dinner?

33:11.948 --> 33:13.324
Celebration's off.

33:13.408 --> 33:16.494
My father's house arrest was extended
for six months.

33:16.577 --> 33:17.412
What? Why?

33:22.166 --> 33:26.337
The parole judge suddenly seems
to think my dad's a threat to society.

33:26.421 --> 33:28.631
Ridiculous.
Cecil wouldn't hurt a fly.

33:28.715 --> 33:32.760
Yet Blake got judges to deny
my dad's parole over and over again.

33:33.928 --> 33:35.930
So, you think Blake's behind this?

33:36.014 --> 33:39.434
-Doesn't this sound just like him?
-It's what he did to me.

33:39.892 --> 33:43.021
Plucked a judge from his cronies
and sicced him on me.

33:43.730 --> 33:45.857
I won't let him get away with this.

33:47.150 --> 33:50.278
-I'm gonna make him pay.
-I'm already working on that.

33:52.280 --> 33:55.616
How do you think Clarke County
ended up in the headlines?

33:55.908 --> 33:56.743
You leaked it?

34:00.079 --> 34:00.913
Damn.

34:01.789 --> 34:02.790
[knocking on door]

34:04.375 --> 34:06.836
Mrs. Carrington?
What are you doing here?

34:07.211 --> 34:08.212
Can I come in?

34:14.177 --> 34:18.473
I lied to you earlier. Fallon didn't go
to the dance with Robby Reed.

34:19.223 --> 34:22.101
-What?
-No, she always planned to go with you.

34:22.351 --> 34:27.315
I had to fabricate a story to make you go
away so I could protect you from Blake.

34:28.190 --> 34:29.400
I am so sorry.

34:30.735 --> 34:34.989
-I had to come here to tell you the truth.
-Fallon thinks I stood her up?

34:35.072 --> 34:37.992
If she knew I lied to her,
she'd never forgive me.

34:38.076 --> 34:39.368
But that's my fault.

34:39.869 --> 34:41.329
You never deserved this.

34:41.411 --> 34:45.541
It's all too much. Your father's in jail,
your mother leaves you,

34:45.625 --> 34:49.337
-you raise your sister--
-What's that have to do with anything?

34:50.630 --> 34:51.464
Uh...

34:52.507 --> 34:54.467
I should have never come here.

34:55.802 --> 34:57.136
What have I ever done?

34:58.137 --> 34:58.971
Huh?

34:59.305 --> 35:01.140
Why do you and your husband hate me?

35:01.224 --> 35:02.975
I could never hate you.

35:03.059 --> 35:07.605
-You don't want me to be with Fallon.
-If you pursue her, Blake will take away

35:07.688 --> 35:11.275
so much more than your scholarship.
You're no match for him.

35:13.194 --> 35:15.029
Promise me you'll let her go.

35:16.239 --> 35:17.824
[Alexis]
I have made mistakes.

35:17.907 --> 35:22.328
I wanted to tell you years ago,
but now, you deserve to know the truth.

35:32.755 --> 35:35.967
You can't even wait for me
to pack up my things.

35:36.050 --> 35:40.012
-I didn't know he was gonna fire you.
-Please, spare me another lie.

35:41.430 --> 35:45.309
I can't believe I thought
you'd actually stand up to your father.

35:45.393 --> 35:48.896
You wanted me to scream
bloody murder at a press conference?

35:48.980 --> 35:50.940
-Why not?
-I'd be called a lunatic

35:51.023 --> 35:53.025
and a yes-man would take this job.

35:53.109 --> 35:56.654
-I can do more good from the inside.
-I thought so, too.

35:57.405 --> 35:59.949
Just because you failed
doesn't mean I will.

36:00.032 --> 36:00.867
You're right.

36:01.659 --> 36:05.746
Maybe you already succeeded.
We never really had a deal.

36:05.830 --> 36:06.956
What's that mean?

36:07.039 --> 36:09.542
How do I know
you didn't leak the story?

36:09.625 --> 36:13.379
-Why would I do that?
-To force your father's hand.

36:13.462 --> 36:15.798
To be the hero
that cleaned up my mess.

36:15.882 --> 36:19.510
To get the COO job you wanted
from the moment I met you.

36:19.594 --> 36:20.678
You really think

36:20.761 --> 36:24.724
I wanna give up my company
to go back to working for my dad?

36:24.807 --> 36:28.477
At first I thought it was for Culhane,
but that was my mistake,

36:28.561 --> 36:32.732
because now I see that it's not about him,
or even your dad.

36:33.441 --> 36:37.278
At the end of the day,
you only care about you.

36:39.488 --> 36:41.532

40:14.495 --> 40:15.621
Adam?

40:17.748 --> 40:20.918
[Alexis] You must have wondered
why I came to you that night.

40:21.001 --> 40:26.882
You know, in some misguided way,
I was trying to protect you.

40:28.384 --> 40:29.218
From what?

40:31.929 --> 40:34.640
I thought if I could
keep you away from Fallon,

40:34.723 --> 40:37.268
I could push you out
of Blake's crosshairs.

40:37.977 --> 40:40.271
-That didn't work.
-It did for a while.

40:40.354 --> 40:41.939
I was practically a child.

40:43.816 --> 40:47.736
How the hell could Blake hate me
so much that I needed protection?

40:47.820 --> 40:50.239
-Was he that racist?
-His father was.

40:50.322 --> 40:54.201
-Thomas? He didn't even know me.
-I wanted to tell you that night,

40:54.285 --> 40:57.997
but I was afraid of what Blake would do.
I'm not afraid anymore.

40:58.080 --> 41:03.252
I couldn't let you be with Fallon because
I knew what Blake was keeping from you,

41:04.253 --> 41:07.381
and just how deep the greed goes.

41:07.465 --> 41:09.133
What was he keeping from me?

41:10.009 --> 41:11.969
The fact that you're one of them.

41:12.970 --> 41:14.638
You're a Carrington, Jeff.

41:16.140 --> 41:17.600
What have I done?

41:17.683 --> 41:19.560
-It's just reality.
-[Alexis] I'm sorry.
