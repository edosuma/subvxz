WEBVTT

00:04.047 --> 00:06.441
FANTASTIC, GUYS. FANTASTIC.

00:06.484 --> 00:09.052
I AM SO GLAD
YOU ARE BACK.

00:09.096 --> 00:10.140
THANK YOU.

00:10.184 --> 00:11.228
THE LINE COOK
CANDIDATES?

00:11.272 --> 00:12.621
KNIFE SKILLS
WERE SOLID.

00:12.664 --> 00:14.362
HAVEN'T EVEN TRIED
THEIR FOOD YET.

00:14.405 --> 00:17.495
HEY, GUYS, THANK YOU
SO MUCH FOR COMING.

00:17.539 --> 00:20.498
WE WILL LET YOU
KNOW BEFORE TOMORROW.

00:20.542 --> 00:22.022
HEY, MAMA,
GOT YOUR LUO BO.

00:22.065 --> 00:23.197
OOH, THANK YOU.

00:23.240 --> 00:25.286
LET ME CHECK THAT
OFF THE LIST.

00:27.027 --> 00:29.551
OH, ARE THESE
UP FOR GRABS?

00:31.074 --> 00:32.641
HEY.

00:34.208 --> 00:36.210
OH...

00:36.253 --> 00:38.734
I NEEDED
TO TRY THOSE.

00:38.777 --> 00:40.692
- SORRY.
- WELL?

00:40.736 --> 00:43.173
- WELL, THAT WAS BAD.
- OOH...

00:43.217 --> 00:46.046
I GUESS TRACY
IS A NO.

00:46.089 --> 00:47.525
UH-UH.

00:47.569 --> 00:49.440
WHY DO I FEEL LIKE I'M
FORGETTING SOMETHING?

00:49.484 --> 00:52.313
MAMA. OH.
I'M SORRY.

00:52.356 --> 00:54.097
I THOUGHT
PEI LING WAS OK.

00:54.141 --> 00:55.359
HOW'S IT FEEL?

00:55.403 --> 00:57.796
NO. THEY'RE HEALING.
AND HOW IS SHE?

00:57.840 --> 00:59.537
SHE FEELS TERRIBLE.

00:59.581 --> 01:01.104
I'VE BEEN TELLING HER
NOT TO BLAME HERSELF,

01:01.148 --> 01:02.540
BUT SHE WON'T LISTEN.

01:02.584 --> 01:04.803
FINALLY MOVED HER OUT
OF HENRY'S APARTMENT.

01:04.847 --> 01:06.283
HE SEEMS TO BE
DOING OK,

01:06.327 --> 01:07.415
BUT IT'S ONLY BEEN A WEEK,
AND HE JUST WENT THROUGH

01:07.458 --> 01:08.633
THIS MASSIVE
TRANSFORMATION--

01:08.677 --> 01:10.070
HOLD ON.

01:10.113 --> 01:11.897
SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE TAKING
CARE OF A LOT OF PEOPLE.

01:11.941 --> 01:14.944
I HOPE YOU'RE ALSO TAKING
CARE OF YOURSELF, TOO.

01:14.987 --> 01:16.685
WE GOT A VISITOR--

01:16.728 --> 01:19.122
OUR FRIEND FROM
MELODY DUMPLINGS.

01:19.166 --> 01:21.385
MEI-LI:
WHAT IS SHE DOING HERE?

01:21.429 --> 01:22.995
ISN'T SHE
YOUR RIVAL?

01:23.039 --> 01:26.434
- MORE LIKE FRENEMY.
- MMPH!

01:26.477 --> 01:28.610
A TOKEN OF GOOD LUCK.

01:28.653 --> 01:31.482
I KNOW YOU'VE WORKED
SO HARD TO REOPEN.

01:31.526 --> 01:34.224
MELODY, WHAT
A SURPRISE. THANK YOU.

01:34.268 --> 01:36.618
OPENING DAYS
CAN BE SO CHAOTIC.

01:36.661 --> 01:38.968
I HOPE NOTHING
GOES WRONG TOMORROW.

01:39.011 --> 01:40.535
MM.

01:40.578 --> 01:41.927
LOOKS LIKE YOU STILL HAVE
A TON OF WORK TO GET READY.

01:41.971 --> 01:43.146
I'LL LET YOU
GET BACK TO IT.

01:43.190 --> 01:45.757
THANK YOU.
ZHU IN HAO YUN.

01:46.802 --> 01:48.151
IT'S
LOOKING GOOD, MEI-LI.

01:48.195 --> 01:50.327
MM-HMM.
HEY, HEY, LAO PO.

01:50.371 --> 01:51.981
- JIN...
- HMM?

01:52.024 --> 01:53.417
WHAT'S THAT?

01:53.461 --> 01:55.332
LIL DUMPY,
OUR MASCOT.

01:55.376 --> 01:57.421
MADE THE FULL
PLASTER MYSELF.

01:57.465 --> 02:00.120
WHERE'S HE,
UH, GOING?

02:00.163 --> 02:03.340
OUT FRONT,
OF COURSE. HMM.

02:03.384 --> 02:04.776
UH,
MEI-LI...

02:04.820 --> 02:08.128
OHH, ONLY EVER
SEEN THIS IN PICTURES.

02:08.171 --> 02:10.173
I REMEMBER.

02:10.217 --> 02:11.696
I USED TO TRY
AND JUMP UP

02:11.740 --> 02:13.394
AND SWAT IT,
BUT I WAS TOO SHORT.

02:13.437 --> 02:15.047
- HA HA!
- HA HA HA!

02:15.091 --> 02:16.484
I HOPE TOMORROW
GOES WELL.

02:16.527 --> 02:18.181
WELL, SEBASTIAN'S
FEELING BULLISH,

02:18.225 --> 02:19.617
THINKS WE'RE GONNA
HAVE A FULL HOUSE.

02:19.661 --> 02:23.230
OH. ARE THINGS BETTER
SINCE YOUR TIFF?

02:23.273 --> 02:24.970
OH, BETTER
THAN BETTER.

02:25.014 --> 02:26.581
@MM.

02:26.624 --> 02:28.322
I GAVE AN INCH, MADE SPACE
FOR HIM IN THE APARTMENT.

02:28.365 --> 02:30.019
HE STARTS GIVING ME
BACKRUBS AFTER MY SHIFTS.

02:30.062 --> 02:31.455
NOW IT'S LIKE
AN ARMS RACE

02:31.499 --> 02:32.891
TO SEE WHO CAN BE
THE BETTER BOYFRIEND,

02:32.935 --> 02:36.156
BUT THE COMPETITION
HAS ITS REWARDS.

02:36.199 --> 02:38.158
GOT IT.
SAY NO MORE.

02:38.201 --> 02:39.637
EH, YOU'RE
JUST JELLY--

02:39.681 --> 02:41.726
LIVING AT HOME,
NO PRIVACY.

02:41.770 --> 02:44.251
OHH, I'VE GOT TO GET
OUT OF THAT HOUSE.

02:44.294 --> 02:46.644
- HMM.
- HMM.

02:46.688 --> 02:49.343
I NEED A JOB.

02:52.215 --> 02:54.826
1997,
THE YEAR WE OPENED.

02:54.870 --> 02:57.916
I'VE BEEN SAVING THIS
FOR THE RIGHT MOMENT.

02:57.960 --> 03:00.005
DRUMROLL, PLEASE.

03:00.049 --> 03:01.877
OH, HA HA HA!

03:01.920 --> 03:05.097
MAMA, FOR WORKING SO HARD
TO GET HERE AGAIN.

03:05.141 --> 03:06.751
LAO GONG,
NOT YET.

03:06.795 --> 03:08.492
MAMA,
WE SHOULD CELEBRATE.

03:08.536 --> 03:10.015
YEAH. YOU
DESERVE THIS.

03:10.059 --> 03:12.322
NO. THERE'S STILL SO MUCH
WORK TO DO TOMORROW,

03:12.366 --> 03:16.544
AND WE
ARE BEING WATCHED.

03:17.980 --> 03:19.329
CARRIE?

03:19.373 --> 03:20.852
I THOUGHT YOU TWO
WERE THICK AS THIEVES.

03:20.896 --> 03:22.506
YEAH, BUT SHE STILL
ANSWERS TO CORPORATE,

03:22.550 --> 03:24.682
AND IT'S MADE CLEAR,
IF THINGS GO BADLY,

03:24.726 --> 03:26.249
THEY'RE GONNA CUT BACK
ON OUR FUNDING,

03:26.293 --> 03:28.599
AND ALL OF THIS
COULD GO AWAY,

03:28.643 --> 03:30.688
SO BEFORE WE POP
THE CHAMPAGNE,

03:30.732 --> 03:32.821
LET'S JUST GET
THROUGH TOMORROW.

03:32.864 --> 03:34.997
QUIN AI DE NI, YOU
HAVE NOTHING TO FEAR.

03:35.040 --> 03:36.520
PAPA IS RIGHT.

03:36.564 --> 03:38.479
RESTAURANT'S READY.
YOU'RE READY.

03:38.522 --> 03:41.743
TOMORROW NIGHT
IS GONNA GO GREAT.

03:53.581 --> 03:57.411
MEI-LI:
I CAN EXPLAIN EVERYTHING.

04:14.515 --> 04:15.907
- AH, LAO PO...

04:15.951 --> 04:19.215
GOOD PRESS
FOR TONIGHT. OOH!

04:19.259 --> 04:22.131
AY. OH, MY HAIR.

04:22.174 --> 04:23.654
YOU LOOK
BEAUTIFUL. WHAT?

04:23.698 --> 04:25.569
- OH...
- WHAT? EH.

04:25.613 --> 04:28.224
UM, CARRIE MENTIONED
SOMETHING LAST NIGHT

04:28.268 --> 04:29.573
ABOUT LITTLE DUMPY.

04:29.617 --> 04:32.402
OH. WHAT ABOUT
LIL DUMPY?

04:32.446 --> 04:35.666
- SHE LOVES HIM.
- OH, GOOD. MM-HMM.

04:35.710 --> 04:36.537
MORNING.

04:36.580 --> 04:37.755
MEI-LI:
MORNING, ALTHEA.

04:37.799 --> 04:38.930
MARCHING ORDERS
ON THE COUNTER.

04:38.974 --> 04:40.541
HUH HUH HUH? YEAH?

04:40.584 --> 04:41.759
- YEAH.
- OH, THANK YOU.

04:41.803 --> 04:42.934
HMM? OH.

04:42.978 --> 04:44.327
I THOUGHT
I WAS SPLITTING THESE

04:44.371 --> 04:45.807
WITH NICKI
AND RYAN.

04:45.850 --> 04:47.330
NO. SHE'S GOT A CLASS,
AND HE'S IN THE E.R.

04:47.374 --> 04:50.333
RIGHT, THE GAINFULLY
EMPLOYED CHILDREN.

04:50.377 --> 04:52.335
CAN'T SOMEONE ELSE
DO THE LOBSTERS?

04:52.379 --> 04:53.641
I HATE THIS PLACE.

04:53.684 --> 04:55.338
THE WUS BEEN
OUR FRIENDS FOR--

04:55.382 --> 04:59.168
DECADES. I KNOW,
BUT THE SMELL--

04:59.211 --> 05:01.170
- OH.
- OK.

05:01.213 --> 05:02.302
BYE, GUYS. THANKS.

05:22.974 --> 05:24.411
NICKY.

05:24.454 --> 05:26.848
BROUGHT YOU
SOME SUPPLIES.

05:26.891 --> 05:28.502
THANK YOU.

05:28.545 --> 05:32.027
SHIFU, YOU SHOULDN'T
BE LIVING HERE.

05:33.420 --> 05:35.465
HENRY IS BACK
AT HIS APARTMENT.

05:35.509 --> 05:37.206
YOU MOVED
BACK HOME.

05:37.249 --> 05:40.383
I DO NOT MIND,
NICKY, HMM?

05:40.427 --> 05:42.472
IT IS SIMPLE,

05:42.516 --> 05:46.433
NO RENT,
AND I AM ALONE,

05:46.476 --> 05:48.304
WHERE I CANNOT
HURT ANYONE.

05:48.348 --> 05:50.567
I TOLD YOU,
MAMA IS FINE.

05:50.611 --> 05:52.656
SHE DOESN'T BLAME YOU
FOR WHAT HAPPENED.

05:52.700 --> 05:54.615
NONE OF US DO.

05:54.658 --> 05:56.399
YOU WON'T HAVE
TO STAY HERE LONG.

05:56.443 --> 05:57.792
RYAN AND I ARE
WORKING ON IT.

05:57.835 --> 05:59.271
CLEARLY,
SMASHING THE PENDANT

05:59.315 --> 06:00.490
DIDN'T GET RID
OF XIAO,

06:00.534 --> 06:02.492
BUT WE'LL FIND
ANOTHER WAY.

06:02.536 --> 06:06.801
IN THE MEANTIME...

06:12.372 --> 06:15.157
FOR THE REOPENING TONIGHT.

06:15.200 --> 06:18.595
IT WOULD MEAN A LOT
TO ME IF YOU WERE THERE.

06:22.294 --> 06:23.992
THANK YOU.

06:24.862 --> 06:26.560
I WILL THINK
ABOUT IT.

06:30.607 --> 06:32.870
MM! OH, MY GOD.

06:32.914 --> 06:35.656
IF I KNEW BREAKFAST
WOULD TASTE THIS GOOD,

06:35.699 --> 06:38.180
I WOULD'VE MADE SPACE
FOR YOU MONTHS AGO.

06:38.223 --> 06:40.791
- MM!
- HA HA HA! YEAH?

06:40.835 --> 06:44.229
WELL, BREAKFAST
IS JUST A WARMUP.

06:44.273 --> 06:45.840
WHAT?

06:45.883 --> 06:47.929
- TSK.

06:51.193 --> 06:52.890
KING KWONG
LIMITED EDITION.

06:52.934 --> 06:55.545
OH, THIS IS DOPE. WAIT.

06:55.589 --> 06:57.634
DID I FORGET
AN ANNIVERSARY?

06:57.678 --> 06:59.419
I SAW IT, I KNEW
YOU'D LOVE IT.

06:59.462 --> 07:02.857
OHH! HA HA HA!

07:02.900 --> 07:05.599
BESIDES,
IT'S HALF FOR ME.

07:05.642 --> 07:07.644
- YES.
- HUH?

07:07.688 --> 07:08.993
- YOU LOOK HOT IN IT.
- HUH?

07:09.037 --> 07:10.865

07:10.908 --> 07:13.911

07:13.955 --> 07:16.653
GOT TO RUN.
BIG DAY.

07:16.697 --> 07:19.830
RIGHT.

07:19.874 --> 07:21.832
YOUR "FIRST DAY
BACK AT WORK" GIFT,

07:21.876 --> 07:24.487
IT'S GONNA
BLOW YOUR MIND.

07:24.531 --> 07:25.749
- YOU GOT ME SOMETHING?
- MM-HMM.

07:25.793 --> 07:27.447
OH, YEAH.
OF COURSE I DID.

07:27.490 --> 07:31.146
WELL, THEN
I CAN'T WAIT.

07:32.147 --> 07:34.584
WHY DID I DO THAT?

07:34.628 --> 07:36.064
IS THAT YOURS?

07:36.107 --> 07:38.109
WE NEED
SOME AIR IN HERE.

07:39.589 --> 07:40.982
- JIN.
- HEY.

07:41.025 --> 07:42.810
SO GLAD YOU DECIDED
TO JOIN THE TEAM.

07:42.853 --> 07:44.594
PRIMARY CHALLENGE
TOOK US OFF GUARD.

07:44.638 --> 07:45.943
WE'VE GOT
OUR HANDS FULL.

07:45.987 --> 07:47.423
THIS IS MY CAMPAIGN
MANAGER ROBBY.

07:47.467 --> 07:48.511
HE'LL BE PUTTING
YOU TO WORK TODAY.

07:48.555 --> 07:49.773
- OH, HELLO.

07:49.817 --> 07:51.035

07:51.079 --> 07:52.646
IN COMMUNITY ACTIVISM,
SO I'M SURE

07:52.689 --> 07:54.343
YOU'RE AN OLD HAND AT
DOOR-TO-DOOR CANVASSING.

07:54.386 --> 07:55.605
CANVASSING?

07:55.649 --> 07:56.780
PUT ONE OF THESE ON
OVER YOUR SHIRT,

07:56.824 --> 07:58.303
SOME EXTRAS
TO HAND OUT.

07:58.347 --> 08:00.131
I'M ASSUMING THAT YOU
HAVE MINIVAN ON YOUR PHONE.

08:00.175 --> 08:01.350
HUH?

08:01.393 --> 08:02.612
IT'S A CANVASSING APP.
DOWNLOAD IT.

08:02.656 --> 08:03.961
YOUR ROUTE AND
ALL THE ADDRESSES.

08:04.005 --> 08:05.702
I'M STARTING YOU OFF
WITH 500 NAMES.

08:05.746 --> 08:07.138
TRY TO HIT THEM ALL.

08:07.182 --> 08:08.488
SYNC YOUR RESULTS TO
THE APP EVERY 5 MINUTES

08:08.531 --> 08:09.576
AND MEET US
BACK HERE AT 1:00.

08:09.619 --> 08:11.142
GREAT.

08:35.732 --> 08:37.429
- HEY.
- HEY.

08:37.473 --> 08:39.344
JUST CAME
TO CHECK ON YOU,

08:39.388 --> 08:42.217
SEE HOW
YOU'RE FEELING.

08:43.044 --> 08:45.133
LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE
GETTING YOUR STRENGTH BACK.

08:47.048 --> 08:48.571
YEAH. UM...

08:48.615 --> 08:50.051
I WAS FEELING
PRETTY WEAK

08:50.094 --> 08:52.314
AFTER THE WHOLE
GENESIS THING

08:52.357 --> 08:56.057
AND BECOMING
THE COMPASS.

08:56.100 --> 08:59.016
GUESS MY BODY HAD TO JUST
PROCESS ALL THAT ENERGY.

08:59.060 --> 09:00.757
HAVE YOU
LEARNED ANYTHING,

09:00.801 --> 09:02.150
YOU KNOW,
WHAT IT ALL MEANS?

09:02.193 --> 09:04.587
I'VE BEEN
HITTING THE BOOKS.

09:04.631 --> 09:05.980
ACCORDING TO THE LORE,
THERE'S NOTHING

09:06.023 --> 09:08.025
ABOUT WHAT
HAPPENS AFTER.

09:08.069 --> 09:11.594
I GUESS I'M
THE ONLY HUMAN EVER

09:11.638 --> 09:14.945
TO CONTAIN THE POWER
OF THE COMPASS,

09:14.989 --> 09:16.947
BUT NOW I KNOW
THAT'S WHY MY DAD

09:16.991 --> 09:19.123
ACTED THE WAY
THAT HE DID.

09:19.167 --> 09:22.257
MY WHOLE LIFE, HE WAS
TRYING TO PROTECT ME.

09:22.300 --> 09:24.694
WELL, YOU DID IT.

09:24.738 --> 09:27.915
YOU FOUND WHAT YOU WERE
LOOKING FOR, THE TRUTH.

09:30.047 --> 09:32.789
I'M GLAD YOU'RE
FEELING BETTER.

09:34.269 --> 09:37.315
BACK THAT TEMPLE,
YOU SAID YOU MOVED ON.

09:38.926 --> 09:40.971
ARE YOU
SEEING SOMEONE?

09:48.631 --> 09:49.893
YEAH.

09:49.937 --> 09:52.461
HENRY, I'M STILL
HERE FOR YOU.

09:52.504 --> 09:54.332
I STILL CARE
ABOUT YOU.

09:56.378 --> 09:58.598
YOU KNOW YOU'LL ALWAYS
BE PART OF THE FAMILY.

09:58.641 --> 10:00.295
YEAH.

10:01.949 --> 10:04.821
I KNOW RYAN REACHED OUT
ABOUT COMING TONIGHT.

10:04.865 --> 10:08.042
YEAH. YEAH. HE DID,
BUT--I DON'T KNOW--

10:08.085 --> 10:12.002
I THINK I-- I THINK
I NEED SOME TIME.

10:12.046 --> 10:13.351
OK.

10:28.497 --> 10:30.064
- HEY.
- HEY.

10:30.107 --> 10:33.284
- YOU OK?
- JUST LEFT HENRY'S.

10:33.328 --> 10:34.982
IT'S LIKE EVERY CONVERSATION,

10:35.025 --> 10:36.853
WE'RE BREAKING UP
ALL OVER AGAIN.

10:36.897 --> 10:39.377
YOU TOLD HIM
ABOUT BO?

10:39.421 --> 10:41.989
HOW'S BO TAKING
ALL OF IT?

10:42.032 --> 10:43.686
I REALLY
WOULDN'T KNOW.

10:43.730 --> 10:46.210
WE'VE BARELY TALKED SINCE
I GOT BACK FROM THAILAND.

10:46.254 --> 10:47.908
YOU'RE NOT GHOSTING
HIM, ARE YOU?

10:47.951 --> 10:51.172
NO. IT'S MORE
LIKE A FIZZLE.

10:51.215 --> 10:53.000
I JUST-- I DIDN'T
KNOW WHAT TO SAY

10:53.043 --> 10:55.263
WHEN I GOT BACK,
ALL THE HENRY STUFF,

10:55.306 --> 10:56.960
SO I TRIED
TO KEEP IT LIGHT.

10:57.004 --> 10:59.484
THEN I WAS TOO LIGHT.

10:59.528 --> 11:00.921
IT GOT TO THE POINT

11:00.964 --> 11:02.357
WHERE WE DIDN'T
HAVE ANYTHING TO SAY,

11:02.400 --> 11:04.968
AND BEFORE I KNEW IT,
OUR TEXTS JUST DRIED UP.

11:05.012 --> 11:06.404
NOW I CAN'T STOP OVERTHINKING

11:06.448 --> 11:09.146
HOW HE'LL REACT
TO WHAT I SAY NEXT.

11:09.190 --> 11:10.539
YES, CARRIE.

11:10.582 --> 11:12.759
WE JUST DID A FINAL CHECK
ON THE DELIVERY APP, BUT--

11:15.152 --> 11:17.198
CARRIE, ON PHONE:
MEI-LI, IS EVERYTHING OK?

11:17.241 --> 11:20.288
YEAH. I'M GONNA
HAVE TO CALL YOU BACK.

11:22.725 --> 11:24.858
- NICKI, THIS IS BAD.
- YEAH.

11:24.901 --> 11:26.511
"HOWDY"?
YOU DID NOT.

11:26.555 --> 11:27.730
YEAH. I DID.

11:27.774 --> 11:28.731
OK. YOU'VE
GOT TO FIX THIS.

11:28.775 --> 11:29.906
I KNOW.

11:29.950 --> 11:31.212
ALL I WANT IS
TO SEE HIM AGAIN

11:31.255 --> 11:32.822
AND PICK UP
WHERE WE LEFT OFF,

11:32.866 --> 11:34.171
BUT EVERYTHING HAS
GOTTEN SO AWKWARD,

11:34.215 --> 11:35.520
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHERE TO START.

11:35.564 --> 11:37.697
- GIRLS...
- MAMA?

11:37.740 --> 11:40.047
COME.

11:42.223 --> 11:45.182
LOOK. BANNER'S GONE,
AND WE'VE BEEN VANDALIZED.

11:45.226 --> 11:46.749
WHO
WOULD DO THIS?

11:46.793 --> 11:48.795
THEY LEFT
A MESSAGE.

11:48.838 --> 11:50.448
"DON'T EVEN THINK
ABOUT OPENING TONIGHT,

11:50.492 --> 11:52.886
OR THIS IS JUST
THE BEGINNING."

11:58.500 --> 12:01.068
NOT LIL DUMPY.

12:01.111 --> 12:02.896
MAYBE WE SHOULD
POSTPONE THE OPENING,

12:02.939 --> 12:04.201
FIGURE OUT
WHO DID THIS.

12:04.245 --> 12:05.637
NO. WE'VE SPENT
MONEY ON THE FLIERS.

12:05.681 --> 12:06.726
IT'S ALREADY
IN THE PRESS.

12:06.769 --> 12:07.857
KITCHEN'S
FULLY STOCKED.

12:07.901 --> 12:09.206
CAN YOU TALK
TO CARRIE?

12:09.250 --> 12:10.730
NO. SHE CANNOT
GET WIND OF THIS.

12:10.773 --> 12:12.079
CORPORATE IS JUDGING
OUR PERFORMANCE

12:12.122 --> 12:13.733
- AT EVERY ANGLE.
- OK.

12:13.776 --> 12:15.082
THEN WE OPEN
TONIGHT AS PLANNED,

12:15.125 --> 12:16.823
FIND OUT WHO DID THIS,
AND STOP THEM

12:16.866 --> 12:18.041
BEFORE THEY PULL
ANYTHING ELSE.

12:18.085 --> 12:19.608
WHERE
DO WE START?

12:19.651 --> 12:20.914
BUILD A SUSPECT LIST.

12:20.957 --> 12:24.134
MAMA, DO YOU HAVE
ANY ENEMIES

12:24.178 --> 12:25.701
WE SHOULD
KNOW ABOUT?

12:25.745 --> 12:27.224
ENEMIES? NO.

12:27.268 --> 12:30.140
MM, I CAN
THINK OF ONE.

12:33.274 --> 12:36.277
I HOPE NOTHING
GOES WRONG TOMORROW.

12:37.582 --> 12:39.889
MELODY.

12:41.151 --> 12:42.762
BRO, YOU DON'T GET IT.

12:42.805 --> 12:44.807
I PROMISED AN AMAZING GIFT,
AND I'VE GOT NOTHING.

12:44.851 --> 12:46.156
- I'M SCREWED.
- SORRY, BRO.

12:46.200 --> 12:48.463
I CAN'T RELATE.
GIFTS ARE EASY.

12:48.506 --> 12:51.074
IF YOU LOVE SOMEONE,
YOU KNOW WHAT THEY LOVE.

12:51.118 --> 12:53.033
YEAH, YEAH, DENNIS SOONG,
KING OF GIFTS.

12:53.076 --> 12:54.643
WHY DO YOU THINK
I'M CALLING YOU?

12:54.686 --> 12:55.949
JUST KEEP IT SIMPLE.

12:55.992 --> 12:57.907
SEB'S A CHEF, PASSIONATE
ABOUT HIS CRAFT.

12:57.951 --> 12:59.909
WHAT WOULD
A CHEF WANT?

12:59.953 --> 13:03.783
AH, DUDE, UH...LIKE,
A FORK? A SPATULA!

13:03.826 --> 13:05.393

13:05.436 --> 13:07.090

THERE YOU GO. EASY.

13:16.360 --> 13:17.448
HARDLY, DUDE.

13:17.492 --> 13:19.146
THOSE THINGS ARE MADE
TO ORDER IN JAPAN,

13:19.189 --> 13:22.062
TAKES 8 WEEKS MINIMUM, AND
THEY'RE SUPER EXPENSIVE.

13:22.105 --> 13:24.151
HELLO? WHERE'D YOU GO?

13:24.194 --> 13:26.675

USED BUT PRISTINE.

13:30.679 --> 13:32.072
FIRST COME,

13:32.115 --> 13:33.464
ALL RIGHT, DENNIS!

13:33.508 --> 13:35.510
YOU REALLY ARE THE KING.
I OWE YOU MY LIFE.

13:35.553 --> 13:36.728
HAPPY TO HELP.

13:36.772 --> 13:38.252
OH, OH, WAIT.
HEY, HEY, HEY.

13:38.295 --> 13:41.646
I TOOK BART TO WORK.

13:41.690 --> 13:43.344

HEY, EXCUSE ME. HI.

14:09.196 --> 14:12.199
WELL, FOR STARTERS,

14:12.242 --> 14:13.896
IT'S FIRST THING
MY CLIENTS SEE.

14:13.940 --> 14:16.290
YOU KNOW, I CAN FILE
A SERVICE REQUEST.

14:16.333 --> 14:17.944
- I ALREADY DID...
- YOU DID?

14:17.987 --> 14:19.859

14:21.251 --> 14:23.297
JUST A SEC. OK. HANG ON.
HANG ON. ONE SECOND.

14:23.340 --> 14:24.689

14:30.130 --> 14:32.872
HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT?
LET ME HELP YOU RIGHT NOW.

14:32.915 --> 14:34.438

THOSE LITTLE BOXES

14:34.482 --> 14:36.397
IN THE BIG BOX
AND HAUL IT AWAY.

14:36.440 --> 14:37.702

14:37.746 --> 14:38.965
YEAH. COME ON.
LET'S GO.

14:39.008 --> 14:40.314
ALL RIGHT.

14:40.357 --> 14:42.011
MELODY STOLE
MY LINE COOK.

14:42.055 --> 14:43.708
SHE COPIED
MY MENU DESIGN.

14:43.752 --> 14:46.494
SHE IMITATED
MY BRAND.

14:46.537 --> 14:50.715
HARMONY DUMPLINGS,
MELODY DUMPLINGS.

14:50.759 --> 14:52.630
ISN'T HER NAME
MELODY?

14:52.674 --> 14:57.157
SHE PROBABLY CHANGED IT.
THE WOMAN IS SHAMELESS.

14:57.200 --> 15:00.203
MEI-LI,
QUICK QUESTION.

15:00.247 --> 15:02.118
WHAT
HAPPENED HERE?

15:02.162 --> 15:04.904
EXECUTIVE DECISION,
HAD TO BE DONE.

15:04.947 --> 15:06.427
SMART.

15:06.470 --> 15:07.994
SO THE LOBSTER SPECIAL,
IT'S ALL OVER SOCIAL,

15:08.037 --> 15:09.386
BUT I JUST SAW
THE LOBSTER TANK.

15:09.430 --> 15:10.213
IT'S EMPTY.

15:10.257 --> 15:11.736
OH. I'M
ALL OVER IT.

15:11.780 --> 15:13.390
YEAH. NICKI WAS JUST
ABOUT TO GRAB THE VAN.

15:13.434 --> 15:14.435
GREAT.

15:14.478 --> 15:15.740
WELL, I GOT TO
SWING BY THE OFFICE.

15:15.784 --> 15:17.046
I'LL SEE YOU
ALL TONIGHT.

15:17.090 --> 15:19.875
SURE. NICKY, GRAB
THOSE LOBSTERS.

15:19.919 --> 15:21.921
ALTHEA, HOLD
DOWN THE FORT.

15:21.964 --> 15:25.794
SEB AND I ARE GONNA PAY
AN OLD FRIEND A LITTLE VISIT.

15:31.321 --> 15:32.888
- KAI.
- YEAH?

15:32.932 --> 15:35.064
WE'RE HERE
FOR THE KUBOMOTO.

15:36.152 --> 15:37.501
BEAUTIFUL,
ISN'T SHE?

15:37.545 --> 15:40.200
OOH, HOO HOO! HELL YEAH.
SEB'S GONNA FLIP.

15:40.243 --> 15:42.419
YOU GOT PROOF
OF AUTHENTICITY?

15:42.463 --> 15:43.986
WHAT PROOF YOU NEED?
JUST LOOK AT IT.

15:44.030 --> 15:45.248
YOU CAN'T FAKE
THAT ARTISTRY.

15:45.292 --> 15:46.989
PRETTY LOW PRICE
FOR A KUBOMOTO.

15:47.033 --> 15:49.296
IN A "NEED CASH
FAST" SITUATION, OK?

15:50.862 --> 15:52.516
WAIT.
YOU A DOCTOR?

15:52.560 --> 15:54.214
UH, YEAH.

15:54.257 --> 15:56.433
DEAL'S CHANGED.

15:56.477 --> 15:59.436
IT'S CLEAR
YOU WANT THIS BAD.

15:59.480 --> 16:00.916
I'M GONNA NEED SOMETHING
A LITTLE EXTRA.

16:00.960 --> 16:02.309
YOU CAN'T JUST
CHANGE THE TERMS.

16:02.352 --> 16:03.310
BUYING KNIVES OUT OF
A STRANGER'S TRUNK

16:03.353 --> 16:04.572
IS A LOT LIKE LOVE.

16:04.615 --> 16:06.487
THERE ARE NO RULES. LOOK.

16:06.530 --> 16:08.489
I'M IN A SITUATION, OK?
WIFE'S OUT OF TOWN.

16:08.532 --> 16:10.186
I MAY HAVE SLIPPED
MY RING OFF

16:10.230 --> 16:12.754
FOR A NIGHT OR TWO,
AND THE RING, WELL,

16:12.797 --> 16:14.234
ENDED UP INSIDE HANZO.

16:14.277 --> 16:15.670
WHAT'SA HANZO?

16:15.713 --> 16:18.107
NOT A WHAT, A WHO--

16:18.151 --> 16:19.804
WIFE'S PUREBRED
ENGLISH BULLDOG.

16:19.848 --> 16:21.850
BOY LICKED THE RING
CLEAN OFF THE NIGHTSTAND.

16:21.893 --> 16:23.460
OH, YOU--

16:23.504 --> 16:25.462
OLD LADY COMES HOME
AND I'M ROCKING THIS RINGLESS,

16:25.506 --> 16:26.637
I'M COOKED.

16:26.681 --> 16:27.856
PLAN WAS, SELL THE KNIFE

16:27.899 --> 16:29.205
TO PAY THE VET
TO GET THE RING.

16:29.249 --> 16:30.728
THAT OPENS UP
A WHOLE NEW CAN OF WORMS

16:30.772 --> 16:32.469
BECAUSE I GOT TO EXPLAIN
THE STITCHES.

16:32.513 --> 16:34.906
ONE LOOK AT THOSE
NIMBLE DOCTOR DIGITS OF YOURS,

16:34.950 --> 16:36.473
AND I GOT A NEW PLAN.

16:36.517 --> 16:38.475
YOU GET THE RING
OUT OF HANZO,

16:38.519 --> 16:40.608
THIS BEAUTY'S
ALL YOURS.

16:40.651 --> 16:43.263
SHOULDN'T TAKE TOO LONG.
RING'S CLOSE TO PASSING.

16:43.306 --> 16:45.830
HOW COULD YOU
KNOW THAT?

16:45.874 --> 16:47.876
GOT A METAL DETECTOR.

16:47.919 --> 16:49.791
OK. WE'RE
OUT OF HERE.

16:49.834 --> 16:53.490
WAIT. YOU CAN'T REALLY
BE CONSIDERING THIS.

16:53.534 --> 16:56.189
I'M GETTING SEB
THAT KNIFE.

16:57.929 --> 16:59.801
TAKE ME TO HANZO.

16:59.844 --> 17:01.281
MEI-LI: JUST ADMIT IT.

17:01.324 --> 17:02.760
YOU'VE HAD IT OUT FOR ME
EVER SINCE YOU OPENED

17:02.804 --> 17:05.415
AND LAST NIGHT TAUNTING ME
WITH THAT ORCHID.

17:05.459 --> 17:07.200
- THAT WAS A GIFT.
- OHH...

17:07.243 --> 17:08.897
MELODY, IF YOU
JUST CONFESS,

17:08.940 --> 17:10.159
WE WON'T HAVE TO
PRESS CHARGES.

17:10.203 --> 17:12.335
CHARGES FOR WHAT?
I'M INNOCENT.

17:12.379 --> 17:14.120
THAT BANNER
WAS 25 YEARS OLD,

17:14.163 --> 17:15.382
AND YOU STOLE IT.

17:15.425 --> 17:17.862
AND YOU DESTROYED
LIL DUMPY.

17:17.906 --> 17:20.039
YEAH,
THAT, TOO.

17:20.082 --> 17:21.301
WHERE WERE
YOU THIS MORNING?

17:21.344 --> 17:22.693
OH, I KNOW MY RIGHTS.

17:22.737 --> 17:25.305
I DON'T HAVE
TO TELL YOU ANYTHING.

17:25.348 --> 17:28.351
HEY, WHAT'S
IN THE TRASH CAN?

17:28.395 --> 17:31.137
NOTHING. WAIT!

17:31.180 --> 17:33.574
IS THAT
MY BANNER?

17:36.620 --> 17:39.928
UM...NO.

17:39.971 --> 17:42.365
"PRODUCE
FOR LESS"?

17:42.409 --> 17:44.802
MELODY, THAT'S WHAT
YOU WERE HIDING?

17:44.846 --> 17:47.501
RECEIPT SAYS
9:24 A.M.

17:47.544 --> 17:50.721
SHE WAS SHOPPING WHEN
THE BANNER WAS STOLEN.

17:50.765 --> 17:52.723
SHE'S INNOCENT.

17:52.767 --> 17:54.725
OH, MELODY, I--

17:54.769 --> 17:57.728
I'M SORRY FOR
THE MISUNDERSTANDING.

17:57.772 --> 18:01.080
HEY, NICKY. YEAH.
WE GOT IT WRONG.

18:01.123 --> 18:02.994
- IT'S NOT MELODY.
- YEP.

18:03.038 --> 18:04.735
JUST REALIZED THAT MYSELF.

18:04.779 --> 18:07.129
WHOEVER'S THREATENING US
ISN'T AFTER MAMA.

18:07.173 --> 18:10.437
THEY ARE AFTER ME.

18:15.790 --> 18:17.574
SO YOU'RE
THE TARGET?

18:17.618 --> 18:19.141
THAT'S WHAT
IT LOOKS LIKE.

18:19.185 --> 18:20.577
IT'S GOT TO BE
REVENGE--

18:20.621 --> 18:22.101
TARGET THE FAMILY BUSINESS
TO GET BACK AT ME.

18:22.144 --> 18:24.015
WE GOT TO FIGURE OUT
WHO IT IS.

18:24.059 --> 18:25.626
- I CAN HELP.
- NO, NO, NO.

18:25.669 --> 18:27.845
WE OPEN IN 4 HOURS.
I NEED YOU TO GO TO THE BANK.

18:27.889 --> 18:29.238
VAN'S
IN THE SHOP,

18:29.282 --> 18:30.587
AND RYAN'S NOT
PICKING UP THE PHONE.

18:30.631 --> 18:32.633
YEAH. HE'S BUSY.

18:32.676 --> 18:34.722
DON'T ASK.
ON IT, MAMA SHEN.

18:34.765 --> 18:36.680
- ALL RIGHT.
- THANKS FOR THE RIDE.

18:36.724 --> 18:38.029
ALTHEA?

18:38.073 --> 18:40.380
UM, CAN YOU
SPARE ME, MAMA?

18:40.423 --> 18:42.556
WHOSE LEMONS
ARE THESE?

18:42.599 --> 18:44.427
I'LL TAKE THAT AS YES.

18:44.471 --> 18:45.820
WE PUT TOGETHER
A LIST OF PEOPLE

18:45.863 --> 18:47.169
WHO MIGHT HAVE
A GRUDGE AGAINST YOU.

18:47.213 --> 18:48.431
IT'S PRETTY LONG.

18:48.475 --> 18:51.173
HIT ME.
I'M READY.

18:52.218 --> 18:54.698
114 KNOWN ENEMIES.

18:54.742 --> 18:56.352
OH, GOD.

18:56.396 --> 18:58.224
IN A WAY, IT'S IMPRESSIVE.
YOU'RE LIKE BATMAN.

18:58.267 --> 18:59.747
HOW ARE WE GONNA
NARROW THEM DOWN?

18:59.790 --> 19:01.705
WE CAN ELIMINATE
A LOT OF THEM--

19:01.749 --> 19:04.186
OUT OF STATE,
IN JAIL, OR...DEAD.

19:04.230 --> 19:06.667
A FEW ARE ON THE STRAIGHT
AND NARROW NOW, REFORMED.

19:06.710 --> 19:10.801
GOOD FOR THEM. OH!
REMEMBER VOSTOK?

19:10.845 --> 19:12.368
WE CAUGHT HIM
WITH YIPS' JEWELRY

19:12.412 --> 19:13.804
AT THAT OLD
AMUSEMENT PARK.

19:13.848 --> 19:15.110
- WHAT WAS THAT CALLED?
- DINOLAND.

19:15.154 --> 19:16.242
YES. THAT WAS
REALLY FUN.

19:16.285 --> 19:17.330
NO TIME
FOR NOSTALGIA.

19:17.373 --> 19:19.288
WE NEED TO
FIGURE THIS OUT.

19:19.332 --> 19:21.334
RIGHT.

19:22.335 --> 19:25.381
MR. SHEN, YOU MISSED
YOUR 1 P.M. CHECK-IN.

19:25.425 --> 19:27.035
YOUR LOCATION ON
THE APP WENT DARK.

19:27.078 --> 19:28.428
I TURNED OFF
THE PHONE.

19:28.471 --> 19:30.256
ONE OF OUR CONSTITUENTS
NEEDED HELP,

19:30.299 --> 19:31.779
SO I HELPED HER.

19:31.822 --> 19:33.433
INSTEAD OF HITTING
YOUR ASSIGNED CONTACTS?

19:33.476 --> 19:34.477
EVERY OTHER VOLUNTEER
HIT THEIR TARGET.

19:34.521 --> 19:36.653
WELL, I HIT MY OWN--

19:36.697 --> 19:38.525
FRESH NAMES,
FRESH ADDRESSES.

19:38.568 --> 19:41.049
PUT THAT
IN YOUR CAP.

19:41.092 --> 19:42.268
HOW?

19:42.311 --> 19:43.486
THE PERSON I WAS
HELPING WAS GOING

19:43.530 --> 19:45.271
TO A PROFESSIONAL LUNCHEON.

19:45.314 --> 19:48.361
97 IN-DISTRICT VOTERS
ALL PLEDGED

19:48.404 --> 19:51.886
TO SUPPORT ANTHONY
IN THE PRIMARY.

19:51.929 --> 19:53.888
WELL, YOUR TARGET
WAS A HUNDRED,

19:53.931 --> 19:55.455
SO WE'LL SEE WHAT
ANTHONY HAS TO SAY

19:55.498 --> 19:58.284
ABOUT YOUR
UNDERPERFORMANCE TODAY.

19:59.763 --> 20:02.505
JOSLIP SLAVO'S
STILL LOCKED UP.

20:02.549 --> 20:04.072
AMON'S OUT, TOO--

20:04.115 --> 20:06.205
PASSPORT FLAGGED
IN COSTA RICA.

20:06.248 --> 20:07.945
CHECK THIS OUT.

20:07.989 --> 20:11.384
I FOUND A SOCIAL MEDIA POST
FROM THAT MASTER DRAKE GUY.

20:16.780 --> 20:18.304
UHH!

20:19.130 --> 20:20.567
HE CALLED
YOU OUT, NICKY,

20:20.610 --> 20:22.177
SAID YOU RUINED
HIS SCHOOL

20:22.221 --> 20:23.570
AND DESTROYED
HIS REPUTATION.

20:23.613 --> 20:24.875
OK. IT'S NOT MY FAULT
HE WAS RUNNING

20:24.919 --> 20:26.355
A BOGUS
MARTIAL ARTS ACADEMY.

20:26.399 --> 20:27.574
WELL, CLEARLY HE'S
HOLDING A GRUDGE.

20:27.617 --> 20:28.749
AND HE WAS
NEVER ARRESTED.

20:28.792 --> 20:30.881
HE'S A VIABLE SUSPECT.

20:30.925 --> 20:32.448
WE'VE GOT ONE MORE--

20:32.492 --> 20:34.624
OUR OLD FRIEND
LEIF WINZIG.

20:34.668 --> 20:37.236
I'M NOT GOING BACK
TO SAN QUENTIN.

20:37.279 --> 20:39.542
CLEMENTINE!

20:39.586 --> 20:40.413
HEY!

20:40.456 --> 20:44.243
AGH! UH! UGH!

20:44.286 --> 20:47.637
- OH!
- OH! HOO!

20:47.681 --> 20:49.552
YEAH, BUT HE'S
STILL IN JAIL.

20:49.596 --> 20:50.988
I MEAN, HE COULD BE
RUNNING THE SABOTAGE

20:51.032 --> 20:52.468
FROM THE INSIDE,
BUT HE'D HAVE TO HAVE

20:52.512 --> 20:55.166
A PRETTY BIG
GRUDGE TO BOTHER.

20:55.210 --> 20:57.299
WELL...

20:57.343 --> 20:58.779
WHAT?

20:58.822 --> 21:01.521
HE HAS BEEN SENDING ME
DEATH THREATS FROM JAIL.

21:01.564 --> 21:02.913
YOU DIDN'T THINK
TO MENTION THAT?

21:02.957 --> 21:04.828
I JUST-- I DIDN'T
TAKE HIM SERIOUSLY.

21:04.872 --> 21:07.178
LET'S PAY HIM A VISIT,
SEE IF HE'S OUR GUY.

21:07.222 --> 21:08.484
I'LL PUT IN A CALL
TO SAN QUENTIN,

21:08.528 --> 21:09.920
PULL A FAVOR
WITH THE WARDEN.

21:09.964 --> 21:11.313
ALL RIGHT. WHAT
ABOUT MASTER DRAKE?

21:11.357 --> 21:12.706
HOW DO WE
TRACK HIM DOWN?

21:12.749 --> 21:15.491
WELL, IF I COULD
STILL USE A COMPUTER,

21:15.535 --> 21:17.101
I WOULD JUST HACK
DRAKE'S POST,

21:17.145 --> 21:20.757
USE AN NMAP TOOL
TO PULL UP AN IP ADDRESS, AND--

21:21.802 --> 21:25.501
- GUYS!
- OH, RIGHT. HEH.

21:25.545 --> 21:28.112
- EVAN?
- OH, YES.

21:28.156 --> 21:30.289
THE NMAP TOOL WOULD SHOW
ANY VULNERABILITIES

21:30.332 --> 21:32.291
IN AN OPEN PORT,
LIKE FTP.

21:32.334 --> 21:34.162
THEN I WOULD RUN
A SCRIPT AND BRUTE-FORCE

21:34.205 --> 21:36.120
THE ADMIN. PASSWORD
TO LOOK FOR HIS LOCATION

21:36.164 --> 21:37.774
IN THE METADATA.

21:37.818 --> 21:39.341
ONCE YOU FIND THAT,
YOU CAN LOOK INTO HIS LOCATION--

21:39.385 --> 21:41.300
ALTHEA,
I'M NOT AS FAST AS YOU.

21:41.343 --> 21:43.127
I WILL
WRITE IT DOWN.

21:43.171 --> 21:44.346
DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME.

21:44.390 --> 21:45.956
WE'RE GONNA HAVE
TO SPLIT THIS UP.

21:46.000 --> 21:49.308
LEIF BLEW UP CLEMENTINE.
HE'S MINE.

21:54.835 --> 21:56.663
ALTHEA SHEN.

21:56.706 --> 22:00.362
TO WHAT DO I
OWE THE PLEASURE?

22:00.406 --> 22:01.885
JUST WANT
TO TALK.

22:03.104 --> 22:04.888
ABOUT WHAT?

22:04.932 --> 22:06.412
MY SISTER.

22:06.455 --> 22:09.284
I KNOW YOU'RE STILL MAD SHE
TOOK DOWN YOUR OPERATION,

22:09.328 --> 22:11.721
LANDING YOU HERE.

22:11.765 --> 22:13.593
I KNOW ABOUT
YOUR LETTERS.

22:13.636 --> 22:15.812
SINCE WHEN IS IT
A CRIME TO WRITE LETTERS?

22:15.856 --> 22:20.817
YEAH, BUT, SEE, I DON'T
THINK YOU STOPPED THERE.

22:20.861 --> 22:22.297
HMM...

22:22.341 --> 22:23.864
WE GOT YOUR
MESSAGE, LEIF.

22:23.907 --> 22:26.301
YOU'VE BEEN MESSING
WITH THE FAMILY BUSINESS.

22:26.345 --> 22:27.650
I DON'T KNOW
HOW YOU DID IT,

22:27.694 --> 22:29.391
BUT I KNOW YOU'RE
OBSESSED WITH NICKY.

22:29.435 --> 22:32.394
WELL, SPEAKING
OF OBSESSIONS,

22:32.438 --> 22:36.180
REMEMBER YOURS--
YOUR BABY, YOUR LOVE,

22:36.224 --> 22:39.967
YOUR DARLING
CLEMENTINE?

22:40.010 --> 22:41.838
HOW'D YOU EVEN
GET THAT IN HERE?

22:41.882 --> 22:43.927
I HEARD YOU MIGHT BE
PAYING ME A VISIT,

22:43.971 --> 22:46.669
AND I HAVE MY WAYS.

22:46.713 --> 22:49.846
NOW, IF YOU'LL
EXCUSE ME, ALTHEA,

22:49.890 --> 22:51.848
I'M FEELING
A BIT PECKISH.

22:57.637 --> 22:59.029
I'M IN.

22:59.073 --> 23:00.422
EVAN, ON PHONE:
ANY SIGN OF MASTER DRAKE?

23:00.466 --> 23:01.989
NOT YET.

23:02.032 --> 23:03.207
THIS IS THE LOCATION WE PULLED
OFF THE METADATA.

23:03.251 --> 23:04.426
MAYBE HE MOVED ON.

23:04.470 --> 23:05.993
- SHE HURT ME.
- OH, I SEE HIM.

23:06.036 --> 23:08.038
SHE TOOK EVERYTHING
THAT I HAD.

23:08.082 --> 23:11.433
WE HAVE ONE THING
IN COMMON--

23:11.477 --> 23:14.218
OUR PAIN...

23:14.262 --> 23:17.396
DEREK WILMOT, IF YOU EVER
MESS WITH THEM AGAIN,

23:17.439 --> 23:18.875
YOU'LL BE ARRESTED.

23:18.919 --> 23:20.399
GOT IT.

23:20.442 --> 23:22.749
OUR ANGER...

23:22.792 --> 23:25.012
ALLEGRA CALDWELL
AND KENDALL BURTON.

23:25.055 --> 23:28.232
- CUT IT OUT.
- UH! YAH!

23:28.276 --> 23:29.625
OUR THIRST FOR REVENGE

23:29.669 --> 23:31.453
AGAINST THE WOMAN
THAT DID THIS TO US--

23:31.497 --> 23:34.674
UH! OOH!

23:34.717 --> 23:36.458
NICKY SHEN.

23:36.502 --> 23:37.894
- THAT'S RIGHT.
- YEAH.

23:37.938 --> 23:40.723
- YEAH!
- OH, I HATE HER.

23:40.767 --> 23:43.944
THE WAY SHE HANDLED,
HOW SHE TOOK A TURN,

23:43.987 --> 23:46.773
THE RESPONSIVENESS
OF HER BRAKES, MM!

23:46.816 --> 23:48.427
I TELL YOU,
THEY DON'T MAKE CARS

23:48.470 --> 23:49.906
LIKE CLEMENTINE ANYMORE.

23:49.950 --> 23:51.255
STOP.

23:51.299 --> 23:53.257
IT MUST BURN KNOWING

23:53.301 --> 23:55.695
THAT I WAS THE LAST
ONE TO DRIVE HER.

23:55.738 --> 23:57.261
AFTER
ALL YOUR EFFORTS,

23:57.305 --> 23:59.046
YOU NEVER EVEN GOT THE
CHANGE TO SAY GOOD-BYE,

23:59.089 --> 24:01.483
WELL, NOT BEFORE--
PKHOO!

24:03.616 --> 24:04.921
TELL ME, ALTHEA,

24:04.965 --> 24:06.880
WHAT ARE YOU DRIVING
THESE DAYS--

24:06.923 --> 24:09.360
BUBBLE-SHAPED HYBRID?

24:09.404 --> 24:12.886
WAIT.
AN AMERICAN CAR?

24:12.929 --> 24:16.542
I DON'T HAVE A CAR.
I CAN'T REPLACE CLEMENTINE.

24:16.585 --> 24:19.501
EVEN IF I WANTED TO,
I CAN'T AFFORD IT.

24:21.590 --> 24:23.853
I LOST MY JOB.
I LOST MY HOME.

24:23.897 --> 24:26.160
I'M A COMPLETE FAILURE.

24:26.203 --> 24:28.902
NOW I JUST HELP MY PARENTS
AT THEIR BUSINESS--

24:28.945 --> 24:32.514
SHEN FAMILY
DRY CLEANERS.

24:32.558 --> 24:34.995
WOW. THAT'S--MM.

24:35.038 --> 24:37.171
POOR ALTHEA SHEN,
RIGHT BACK

24:37.214 --> 24:42.611
WHERE SHE STARTED,
THE OLD FAMILY BUSINESS.

24:42.655 --> 24:47.007
GOTCHA. MY FAMILY
OWNS A RESTAURANT.

24:47.050 --> 24:48.399
I KNEW THAT.

24:48.443 --> 24:50.532
NO, YOU DIDN'T,
BUT YOU WOULD'VE

24:50.576 --> 24:53.361
IF YOU WERE THE ONE
REALLY MESSING WITH US.

24:53.404 --> 24:55.885
MM, LEIF, YOU'RE
NO MASTERMIND.

24:55.929 --> 24:59.062
YOU'RE JUST BORED. HMM.

24:59.106 --> 25:01.717
WAIT. WAIT.
DON'T GO.

25:01.761 --> 25:03.806
OH, AND NICE TRY,

25:03.850 --> 25:06.200
BUT...THAT'S
A TANGERINE.

25:08.028 --> 25:10.813
OHH, OK, EVAN.
HE IS NOT ALONE.

25:10.857 --> 25:12.162
EVAN, ON PHONE:
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

25:12.206 --> 25:13.555
AND OUR ANGER
DOESN'T DEFINE US.

25:13.599 --> 25:14.991
HE USED THOSE
SOCIAL MEDIA POSTS

25:15.035 --> 25:16.515
TO BRING A BUNCH OF MY
FORMER ENEMIES TOGETHER.

25:16.558 --> 25:17.864
IT'S WHAT WE DO
WITH OUR ANGER.

25:17.907 --> 25:19.518
KENDALL, CAN YOU
SHARE WITH US

25:19.561 --> 25:21.215
WHY YOU CALLED
THIS MEETING TODAY?

25:21.258 --> 25:24.000
THIS MORNING,
I SAW MY DAD'S NEWSPAPER,

25:24.044 --> 25:26.176
AND THERE WAS AN ARTICLE
ABOUT HER FAMILY.

25:26.220 --> 25:29.528
THERE WAS A PHOTO
OF THAT INSUFFERABLE,

25:29.571 --> 25:31.747
HOLIER-THAN-THOU
SMILE OF HERS.

25:31.791 --> 25:34.837
I GOT SO MAD, I HAD TO DO
SOMETHING ABOUT IT,

25:34.881 --> 25:36.665
SO I GOT INTO MY DAD'S CAR,

25:36.709 --> 25:38.275
AND I DROVE
RIGHT DOWN TO THE RESTAURANT.

25:38.319 --> 25:41.844
I WANTED REVENGE SO BAD,
I COULD TASTE IT.

25:41.888 --> 25:44.020
WHAT DID YOU
DO NEXT?

25:46.240 --> 25:47.807
I TEXTED YOU.

25:47.850 --> 25:50.592
YOU TALKED ME DOWN,
AND I CAME HERE.

25:50.636 --> 25:52.551
YOU DID THE RIGHT
THING, KENDALL.

25:52.594 --> 25:54.117
THE PROGRAM
IS WORKING.

25:54.161 --> 25:56.250
WE'RE ALL HERE TO SUPPORT
EACH OTHER'S JOURNEYS

25:56.293 --> 25:58.208
AND TO HELP
CONTROL OUR ANGER.

25:58.252 --> 25:59.383
WHAT VIRTUE IS THAT?

25:59.427 --> 26:00.907
- VIRTUE 8.
- VIRTUE 8.

26:00.950 --> 26:02.256
YOU'VE ALL MADE GREAT
STRIDES IN TRAVERSING

26:02.299 --> 26:03.692
THE HEALING-
FROM-ANGER PYRAMID,

26:03.736 --> 26:05.172
BUT ONLY THOSE
THAT SUBSCRIBE

26:05.215 --> 26:06.869
TO THE PREMIUM PROGRAM
CAN TRULY REACH

26:06.913 --> 26:09.393
THE APEX
OF INNER PEACE.

26:09.437 --> 26:10.743
YES, SHIFU.

26:10.786 --> 26:13.093
OK, EVAN.
IT IS NOT THEM.

26:13.136 --> 26:14.137
HOW DO YOU KNOW?

26:14.181 --> 26:15.443
THEY'RE NOT
PLANNING ANYTHING.

26:15.486 --> 26:16.749
THEY'RE JUST WHINING.

26:16.792 --> 26:18.054
DRAKE'S GOT A NEW GRIFT

26:18.098 --> 26:20.317
AND A WHOLE NEW
GROUP OF FOLLOWERS.

26:34.462 --> 26:35.942
HEY.

26:35.985 --> 26:37.378
WHAT IS SHE
DOING HERE?

26:37.421 --> 26:39.162
SORRY TO INTERRUPT.

26:39.206 --> 26:41.643
OH, MAN, SO GOOD
TO SEE YOU GUYS AGAIN--

26:41.687 --> 26:45.081
DRAKE LOOKING SHARP
WITH THOSE NEW THREADS

26:45.125 --> 26:47.344
AND KENDALL--
LOVE THE BLONDE--

26:47.388 --> 26:50.696
D-MAN, AND...

26:50.739 --> 26:51.827
BENNY!

26:51.871 --> 26:54.743
BENNY. RIGHT. HUH.

26:54.787 --> 26:56.179
IT'S SO GREAT
THAT YOU GUYS

26:56.223 --> 26:59.269
ARE WORKING ON ALL
THIS ANGER STUFF.

26:59.313 --> 27:01.924
SERIOUSLY, KUDOS,
SO DON'T MIND ME.

27:01.968 --> 27:04.100
I'M JUST GONNA
EXIT THAT DOOR.

27:04.144 --> 27:08.409
MASTER DRAKE, I'M FEELING
IT AGAIN, THE RAGE.

27:08.452 --> 27:10.150
I ONLY ANSWERED
YOUR POST BECAUSE I THOUGHT

27:10.193 --> 27:12.108
WE WOULD BE
GETTING BACK AT HER.

27:12.152 --> 27:14.937
I TRIED IT YOUR WAY, DRAKE,
BUT LOOK AT THAT FACE,

27:14.981 --> 27:17.113
THAT SMUG,
PUNCHABLE FACE.

27:17.157 --> 27:18.114
HEY.

27:18.158 --> 27:19.768
YOU DISLOCATED
MY SHOULDER.

27:19.812 --> 27:21.465
YOU BROKE UP
MY WHOLE CREW.

27:21.509 --> 27:22.684
THAT'S ON ME.

27:22.728 --> 27:24.686
STUDENTS,
PLEASE CALM DOWN.

27:24.730 --> 27:25.992
REMEMBER THE VIRTUES.

27:26.035 --> 27:28.472
YEAH. LISTEN
TO YOUR SHIFU, GUYS.

27:28.516 --> 27:30.170
I HAVE BEEN.

27:30.213 --> 27:33.869
VIRTUE ONE--WE ALL
DESERVE A SECOND CHANCE.

27:33.913 --> 27:37.960
YEAH, A SECOND CHANCE
TO KICK YOUR ASS.

27:38.004 --> 27:40.963
- UH!
- WHOA!

27:41.007 --> 27:43.444
OH, THAT'S REAL THERAPY.
GET HER!

27:43.487 --> 27:45.359
AAGH!

27:48.405 --> 27:49.493
AAGH! OOH!

27:49.537 --> 27:50.625
- UH!
- AAGH!

27:50.669 --> 27:51.887
UH! OH!

27:51.931 --> 27:53.976
- UH!
- OH! MY EYE!

27:54.020 --> 27:56.326
- HUH!
- EH!

27:56.370 --> 27:57.893
UH! OHH...

27:57.937 --> 27:59.852
HUH. AH! YAH!

27:59.895 --> 28:01.984
- WAAH!

GONNA BE SORE TOMORROW.

28:17.260 --> 28:19.523
TWICE NOW YOU HAVE
MADE A FOOL OUT OF ME,

28:19.567 --> 28:23.092
UNWOUND EVERYTHING I'VE
PAINSTAKINGLY BUILT,

28:23.136 --> 28:26.313
BRINGS TO MIND
VIRTUE NUMBER 22--

28:26.356 --> 28:29.098
LEARN FROM
YOUR MISTAKES.

28:35.626 --> 28:36.758
OH! OOH! UH!

28:42.242 --> 28:43.852
RYAN?

28:43.896 --> 28:45.898
ARE YOU OK?

28:45.941 --> 28:48.552
I'LL NEVER
BE OK AGAIN.

28:48.596 --> 28:49.945
IS SEB HERE?

28:49.989 --> 28:51.686
NO. HE JUST
STEPPED OUT.

28:51.730 --> 28:53.079
OH, GOOD.

28:53.122 --> 28:54.558
I NEED SOMEWHERE
TO HIDE THIS FROM HIM.

28:54.602 --> 28:55.559
IT'S A GIFT.

28:55.603 --> 28:57.126
A KNIFE AS A GIFT.

28:57.170 --> 28:58.867
RYAN, YOU KNOW
THAT'S BAD LUCK.

28:58.911 --> 29:01.043
WELL, I'LL
GIVE HIM A PENNY.

29:01.087 --> 29:03.654
OH...

29:03.698 --> 29:05.482
HE NEVER GOES THERE.

29:05.526 --> 29:07.049
OH, AND, YOU KNOW,

29:07.093 --> 29:09.617
PUT THIS OUT
IN FRONT, AS WELL,

29:09.660 --> 29:10.836
AND THEN COME
BACK TO HELP

29:10.879 --> 29:11.880
BECAUSE I NEED
TO GET READY

29:11.924 --> 29:13.534
FOR FRONT OF HOUSE.

29:13.577 --> 29:15.144
OK.

29:33.902 --> 29:37.036
THE HANDWRITING
IS THE SAME.

29:39.429 --> 29:40.909
OH...

29:45.218 --> 29:48.612
WE WILL LET YOU
KNOW BEFORE TOMORROW.

29:49.831 --> 29:50.832
MEI-LI?

30:00.146 --> 30:03.497
HELLO, MEI-LI.
REMEMBER ME?

30:03.540 --> 30:05.455
TRACY, RIGHT?

30:05.499 --> 30:08.502
YOU INTERVIEWED FOR
THE LINE COOK POSITION.

30:08.545 --> 30:11.897
LOOK, TRACY. I'M REALLY SORRY
YOU DIDN'T GET THE JOB.

30:11.940 --> 30:13.812
LIAR!

30:13.855 --> 30:15.161
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

30:15.204 --> 30:16.945
I WANT TO TAKE AWAY
YOUR BIG NIGHT,

30:16.989 --> 30:19.861
TO HURT YOU
LIKE YOU HURT ME.

30:19.905 --> 30:22.516
UM...BACK TO YOU
STATION, GUYS.

30:22.559 --> 30:24.866
- KEEP COOKING.
- I TOLD YOU NOT TO OPEN.

30:24.910 --> 30:29.958
I'M SORRY, TRACY, BUT
WE ARE OPENING TONIGHT.

30:33.657 --> 30:37.836
KUBOMOTO. NICE.

30:40.229 --> 30:42.928
I ALWAYS DREAMED OF
A KNIFE LIKE THIS...

30:44.451 --> 30:47.149
OF WORKING IN A
RESTAURANT LIKE THIS

30:47.193 --> 30:48.803
WITH A CHEF
LIKE YOU.

30:48.847 --> 30:49.891
HEY, MAMA.

30:49.935 --> 30:51.153
YOU.

30:51.197 --> 30:53.416
YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO KILLED MY DREAM.

30:53.460 --> 30:55.897
I--
WHO ARE YOU?

30:55.941 --> 30:58.291
TRACY
IS A CHEF.

30:58.334 --> 31:01.163
SHE CAME HERE
LAST NIGHT.

31:01.207 --> 31:03.122
OK.

31:03.165 --> 31:05.341
YOU DON'T
EVEN REMEMBER

31:05.385 --> 31:08.344
THE MOMENT YOU STOLE
MY FUTURE FROM ME?

31:08.388 --> 31:10.781
MAYBE JOG
MY MEMORY.

31:10.825 --> 31:14.481
YESTERDAY WAS THE MOST
HOPEFUL DAY OF MY LIFE.

31:14.524 --> 31:17.353
IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE THE DAY
I GOT MY FIRST JOB.

31:17.397 --> 31:19.616
I JUST KNEW
I WAS GONNA GET IT.

31:19.660 --> 31:21.357
I WAS NICE TO
THE OTHER CANDIDATES,

31:21.401 --> 31:23.751
BUT I KNEW
THEY WERE JUST AMATEURS,

31:23.794 --> 31:25.535
NOT LIKE ME.

31:25.579 --> 31:27.102
I'M THE REAL DEAL.

31:27.146 --> 31:32.412
THEN YOU WALTZED IT,
ALL MY WORK, MY ONE SHOT.

31:32.455 --> 31:34.631
THEN YOU JUST...

31:34.675 --> 31:37.678
SPIT IT OUT.

31:38.418 --> 31:41.464
MEI-LI: OOH, LOOKS
LIKE TRACY IS A NO.

31:43.597 --> 31:45.207
I'VE BEEN REJECTED
FROM OTHER RESTAURANTS BEFORE,

31:45.251 --> 31:47.035
BUT NOT LIKE THAT.

31:47.079 --> 31:49.429
I'M SORRY.

31:49.472 --> 31:50.909
YOU WORKED HARD.

31:50.952 --> 31:54.390
YOU DESERVED
A FAIR CHANCE.

31:54.434 --> 31:57.393
COOKING IS ALL
I'VE EVER LOVED.

31:57.437 --> 31:59.482
THERE WILL BE
OTHER JOBS,

31:59.526 --> 32:00.570
BUT TONIGHT,

32:00.614 --> 32:03.486
THIS IS OUR ONE
OPENING NIGHT,

32:03.530 --> 32:07.186
SO PUT THE KNIFE
DOWN, PLEASE.

32:07.229 --> 32:09.536
- OK.
- OK.

32:09.579 --> 32:11.973
- SO YOU'LL ADMIT IT.
- ADMIT WHAT?

32:12.017 --> 32:13.932
THAT MY DUMPLING
WAS GOOD.

32:13.975 --> 32:16.325
I NEED YOU TO SAY IT.

32:20.547 --> 32:23.593
Y-YES. YEAH.

32:23.637 --> 32:25.073
IT WAS SO YUMMY,

32:25.117 --> 32:27.119
IT WAS THE BEST
DUMPLING I'VE EVER HAD,

32:27.162 --> 32:30.122
LIKE FLAVORTOWN
IN MY MOUTH.

32:30.165 --> 32:32.646
UMAMI, LIKE,
YOU HIT IT,

32:32.689 --> 32:35.954
AND I WISHED THAT THERE
WAS MORE THAN ONE.

32:40.349 --> 32:43.091
I'M SORRY.
I'M A REALLY BAD LIAR.

32:43.135 --> 32:44.136
D'AGH!

32:44.179 --> 32:45.615
OH! IS THAT
A KUBOMOTO?

32:45.659 --> 32:47.226

32:47.269 --> 32:50.098
NO. TRACY, STOP.

32:52.883 --> 32:55.016

33:06.201 --> 33:08.899

33:08.943 --> 33:11.119
- UGH!
- OH!

33:12.338 --> 33:13.469
RYAN, HEAD HER OFF.

33:13.513 --> 33:14.949
SHE'S GOING

33:14.993 --> 33:16.037
MEI-LI:

33:16.081 --> 33:18.474
