21:48.890 --> 21:50.058
I HAD THE SAME PROBLEM.

21:50.142 --> 21:54.646
{\an5}I GOT OVERSCHEDULED
AND THEN I ENDED UP
LETTING EVERYONE DOWN,

21:54.730 --> 21:55.897
JUST LIKE YOU.

21:55.981 --> 21:57.649
HOW DID YOU BEAT IT?

21:57.733 --> 22:01.069
{\an5}YOU KNOW, I KEPT
REMINDING MYSELF HOW
MUCH BETTER IT WOULD BE

22:01.153 --> 22:03.196
IF I JUST SAID NO
ONCE IN A WHILE.

22:03.280 --> 22:06.491
AND WHEN I DID SAY IT,
IT FELT GREAT.

22:06.575 --> 22:08.118
AND IT WAS EASY
FROM THERE.

22:08.201 --> 22:10.162
SO YOU SHOULD DO
THE SAME.

22:11.997 --> 22:14.166
{\an1}LET'S FACE IT--BREAKING
A HABIT IS TOUGH,

22:14.249 --> 22:15.292
BUT YOU CAN DO IT.

22:15.375 --> 22:17.336
YOU JUST GOT TO KEEP
BELIEVING IN YOURSELF

22:17.419 --> 22:19.463
{\an1}AND KEEP TRYING
TILL YOU GET IT RIGHT.

22:19.546 --> 22:23.216
[MUFFLED YELLING]

22:28.346 --> 22:31.141
{\an1}AND SOMETIMES, YOU NEED
TO TACKLE A BAD HABIT

22:31.224 --> 22:32.934
ONE STEP AT A TIME.

22:33.018 --> 22:35.312
{\an7}START OFF SMALL
AND WORK YOUR WAY UP.

22:38.607 --> 22:40.192
{\an1}IF YOU DO HAVE
A REALLY BAD HABIT,

22:40.275 --> 22:41.109
{\an1}TRY AND STOP IT RIGHT AWAY
AND REMIND YOURSELF

22:41.193 --> 22:44.905
{\an8}HOW BETTER LIFE WOULD BE
WITHOUT IT.

22:44.988 --> 22:46.281
