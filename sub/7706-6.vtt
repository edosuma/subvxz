WEBVTT

00:03.137 --> 00:07.172
Now I ask you, is this a pirate,
or is this a pirate?

00:07.174 --> 00:08.107
Hmm.

00:08.109 --> 00:09.174
(Kate)
'Lynnie?'

00:09.176 --> 00:11.010
Oh. It's a pirate, mom.

00:12.780 --> 00:15.114
- Willie?
- Uh, definitely a pirate.

00:17.118 --> 00:18.450
Good morning.

00:20.554 --> 00:22.121
What are you wearing?

00:22.123 --> 00:24.857
Touch of your aftershave.

00:24.859 --> 00:28.160
No, I meant
those silly glasses.

00:28.162 --> 00:31.530
Silly glasses?
Look who's talking.

00:31.532 --> 00:33.399
This is my Halloween costume.

00:34.568 --> 00:36.835
What are you supposed to be?

00:36.837 --> 00:38.203
Gene Shalit.

00:39.306 --> 00:41.206
Too obscure?

00:41.208 --> 00:44.143
You're not planning on going
trick-or-treating, are you?

00:44.145 --> 00:46.311
Are you kidding? I can't wait.

00:46.313 --> 00:49.848
I'm gonna come back
with a bag full of candy apples

00:49.850 --> 00:53.052
popcorn balls and cats.

00:53.054 --> 00:56.388
ALF, no one's
gonna give you a cat.

00:56.390 --> 01:00.359
Well, that's right.
You have to bob for cats.

01:00.361 --> 01:02.428
[theme music]

01:29.256 --> 01:31.256
[music continues]

02:02.923 --> 02:04.189
[instrumental music]

02:11.298 --> 02:12.397
What's the matter?

02:13.467 --> 02:15.968
Oh, I-I can't sleep.

02:19.840 --> 02:23.675
It's my job promotion.
I-I think I blew it.

02:23.677 --> 02:26.278
What? Honey, how?

02:26.280 --> 02:27.513
Well, today Mr. Burke
took me off

02:27.515 --> 02:30.149
that teen runaway project
I was working on.

02:30.151 --> 02:32.317
I was working on that project
for three months!

02:32.319 --> 02:34.153
- You're kidding!
- No, honey.

02:34.155 --> 02:38.157
He needs me, he says,
for an internal investigation.

02:38.159 --> 02:40.692
So I have to go through
all the requisition files

02:40.694 --> 02:43.362
and see if I can locate
his missing water cooler.

02:45.032 --> 02:46.999
Well, I hope you yelled at him.

02:47.001 --> 02:49.001
I sure did.

02:49.003 --> 02:52.838
But I think I can
kiss that promotion..

02:52.840 --> 02:54.973
...goodbye.

02:54.975 --> 02:58.110
Oh, honey,
you can kiss me goodnight.

02:58.112 --> 02:59.878
I'm proud of you.

02:59.880 --> 03:01.980
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

03:01.982 --> 03:04.216
[both chuckle]

03:13.227 --> 03:15.227
Oh, good, you're up.

03:19.200 --> 03:21.066
Get out of here!

03:21.068 --> 03:24.236
Not until we get this Halloween
thing straightened out.

03:24.238 --> 03:26.205
[sighs]
We already said no, ALF.

03:26.207 --> 03:28.307
You cannot go out
trick-or-treating for candy.

03:28.309 --> 03:31.076
Forget that fear
of cavities, Kate.

03:31.078 --> 03:33.378
I brush once a month,
like clockwork.

03:34.682 --> 03:36.982
We're not talking
about cavities, ALF.

03:36.984 --> 03:39.184
We're talking about
somebody seeing you.

03:39.186 --> 03:40.219
Come on, Will-height

03:40.221 --> 03:43.322
this body is the perfect
Halloween costume.

03:43.324 --> 03:47.392
Besides I have to get out
and see new faces.

03:47.394 --> 03:49.595
Why you ask?

03:49.597 --> 03:51.230
I didn't ask why.

03:51.232 --> 03:54.099
- Well, would you?
- Why?

03:55.436 --> 03:57.536
Why what?

03:57.538 --> 04:00.272
Why do you have to get out
and see new faces?

04:00.274 --> 04:04.343
Why the third degree? I just
want to go trick-or-treating.

04:04.345 --> 04:08.280
You can't, ALF,
it's too dangerous.

04:08.282 --> 04:10.616
Then you leave me no choice.

04:10.618 --> 04:12.351
Read it and weep.

04:14.622 --> 04:17.189
"Free the Halloween one?"

04:17.191 --> 04:19.458
It's a petition signed
by America's

04:19.460 --> 04:21.193
most prominent citizens.

04:22.596 --> 04:25.564
"We demand that you let ALF
go trick-or-treating.

04:25.566 --> 04:28.533
"Signed Presidents Reagan,
Carter, Ford, Lincoln..

04:30.371 --> 04:31.870
...and Mercury."

04:33.607 --> 04:35.407
This is your handwriting.

04:35.409 --> 04:37.209
Hey, it's a joke, man.

04:37.211 --> 04:39.244
My way of saying,
let the funny little alien

04:39.246 --> 04:41.713
have a crack
at the outside world

04:41.715 --> 04:43.415
for one lousy night!

04:43.417 --> 04:45.284
No.

04:45.286 --> 04:48.754
Alright, I'm taking this
to the supreme court.

04:48.756 --> 04:51.990
All the way to Chief Justice
Pontiac, I suppose.

04:53.227 --> 04:55.594
Look, look,
I'll make you a deal.

04:55.596 --> 04:57.396
You let me go out for Halloween

04:57.398 --> 05:00.065
and I'll tell you how you
could still get that promotion.

05:01.802 --> 05:03.935
How do you know about that?

05:03.937 --> 05:07.272
The amazing ALF
knows everything.

05:07.274 --> 05:10.342
Was the amazing ALF listening
at our door again?

05:10.344 --> 05:13.245
The amazing ALF
never reveals his secrets.

05:14.915 --> 05:16.982
Anyway,
what we have to do here

05:16.984 --> 05:19.084
is dig up some dirt
on your boss.

05:19.086 --> 05:23.855
Does he steal from the company?
Go to the salad bar illegally?

05:23.857 --> 05:25.357
Chew with his mouth open?

05:25.359 --> 05:28.660
- You chew with your mouth open.
- Oh, smart, Willie.

05:28.662 --> 05:32.264
Dig up dirt on me.
I can't give you that promotion.

05:33.334 --> 05:35.200
Goodnight, ALF.

05:35.202 --> 05:37.969
Alright, alright, wait.
Forget the dirt.

05:37.971 --> 05:41.139
Get the bossman
to like you again.

05:41.141 --> 05:43.809
Invite him to a party
and butter him up.

05:43.811 --> 05:46.545
I'm not gonna give a party
to butter up my boss.

05:46.547 --> 05:50.515
Who do you think I am,
Dagwood Bumstead?

05:50.517 --> 05:53.151
Think very carefully..

05:53.153 --> 05:55.354
...before you answer that.

05:56.357 --> 05:59.024
Oh, Willie,
a-a party might be fun.

05:59.026 --> 06:01.360
I can't think of the last time
that we had a party.

06:01.362 --> 06:04.563
I mean, our social lives
kinda gone to pot since..

06:05.699 --> 06:08.233
...since you-know-who arrived.

06:08.235 --> 06:10.469
- Who?
- You.

06:10.471 --> 06:12.237
You mean all those times
you complained

06:12.239 --> 06:15.407
about you-know-who, it was me?

06:16.143 --> 06:17.542
So what do you say, honey?

06:17.544 --> 06:20.078
Let's have a party
and have a few people over.

06:20.080 --> 06:22.881
Oh, okay, but not my boss.

06:22.883 --> 06:24.549
I'll handle Mr. Burke myself

06:24.551 --> 06:27.252
in...my own way.

06:27.254 --> 06:28.320
Oh, good thinking.

06:28.322 --> 06:31.390
Have a party
and exclude the boss.

06:31.392 --> 06:34.159
Better yet, walk in tomorrow
morning and hit him with mud.

06:37.197 --> 06:38.964
Oh, brother.

06:44.872 --> 06:46.972
[doorbell rings]

06:51.445 --> 06:53.044
- Trick or treat?
- Trick or treat?

06:53.046 --> 06:55.414
Oh, what do we have here?

06:55.416 --> 06:57.682
We are The Three Stooges.

06:57.684 --> 06:58.884
Three?

06:58.886 --> 07:01.353
Well, Moe had to go
to the bathroom.

07:02.356 --> 07:03.755
Oh.

07:03.757 --> 07:06.958
Well, here, and,
uh, take one for Moe.

07:06.960 --> 07:08.527
- Thank you.
- Happy Halloween.

07:08.529 --> 07:09.795
- Happy Halloween.
- Happy Halloween.

07:09.797 --> 07:11.263
(both)
Nyuck, nyuck, nyuck.

07:11.265 --> 07:14.099
Nyuck, nyuck, nyuck,
nyuck, nyuck..

07:14.101 --> 07:16.401
- More Stooges?
- 'Yeah.'

07:16.403 --> 07:17.369
Okay, now where is ALF?

07:17.371 --> 07:19.438
Oh, he's, uh,
he's in the garage.

07:19.440 --> 07:22.374
Say, Kate,
the house looks great.

07:22.376 --> 07:25.710
Of course, that's probably
because ALF's in the garage.

07:25.712 --> 07:29.047
Honey, do you think that I made
enough punch for 12?

07:29.049 --> 07:30.916
To drink or to bathe in?

07:30.918 --> 07:32.117
[doorbell rings]

07:32.119 --> 07:33.418
(Brian)
'Trick or treat?'

07:33.420 --> 07:35.387
(Lynn)
'Oh, Brian, just open the door.'

07:36.957 --> 07:39.391
(Kate)
'Oh, Blackbeard is home!'

07:39.393 --> 07:41.626
And look, will you

07:41.628 --> 07:43.929
look at all that booty!

07:43.931 --> 07:45.330
Ar-r-rah!

07:46.667 --> 07:48.333
I wanna go out again.

07:48.335 --> 07:50.402
Brian, we went to 32 houses.

07:50.404 --> 07:51.570
Yeah, in eight minutes.

07:51.572 --> 07:53.271
Well, I had to get back
to change for the party.

07:53.273 --> 07:56.308
Lizard will be here any minute.

07:56.310 --> 07:57.309
Lizard?

07:57.311 --> 07:59.177
You heard that too?

07:59.179 --> 08:00.579
What-what kind of name
is Lizard?

08:00.581 --> 08:02.848
I have a friend in school
called frog.

08:02.850 --> 08:04.516
Well, why do they
call him that?

08:04.518 --> 08:06.084
Because he's a frog.

08:07.354 --> 08:09.154
Makes sense.

08:09.156 --> 08:10.856
I gotta go in the garage,
I gotta give ALF

08:10.858 --> 08:12.090
his share of the candy.

08:12.092 --> 08:13.925
Seventy percent.

08:13.927 --> 08:16.261
Seventy percent is a lot.

08:16.263 --> 08:18.163
He wanted ninety!

08:20.200 --> 08:21.533
We have a daughter
dating a lizard

08:21.535 --> 08:24.369
and an alien shaking down
our son for candy.

08:25.639 --> 08:27.239
Let's party.

08:29.476 --> 08:31.309
Whoa!

08:31.311 --> 08:32.477
Yeah!

08:32.479 --> 08:34.145
Great haul, Brian.

08:34.147 --> 08:35.213
Thanks.

08:35.215 --> 08:36.548
I'll guard these.

08:36.550 --> 08:37.816
You get back in the house.

08:37.818 --> 08:39.284
The party's gonna start soon.

08:39.286 --> 08:41.486
Oh, but I hate parties.

08:41.488 --> 08:42.387
Everyone pats me on the head

08:42.389 --> 08:44.823
and says
I'm growing up too fast.

08:44.825 --> 08:47.859
Cut the small talk!
Let's divide up the loot.

08:47.861 --> 08:51.830
Okay, one for you.
One for me.

08:51.832 --> 08:53.565
One for you.

08:53.567 --> 08:55.200
One for me.

08:55.202 --> 08:57.335
One for me.

08:57.337 --> 08:59.070
One for me.

08:59.072 --> 09:01.373
Not so fast, me bucko!

09:02.809 --> 09:05.043
You are growing up too fast.

09:06.647 --> 09:07.979
We'll do this right.

09:09.416 --> 09:10.715
One for me.

09:10.717 --> 09:12.284
One for you.

09:16.056 --> 09:17.389
- Did you see ALF?
- Yeah.

09:17.391 --> 09:19.257
And I still have some
candy left.

09:19.259 --> 09:20.892
He must be losing his touch.

09:20.894 --> 09:21.927
[doorbell rings]

09:21.929 --> 09:24.162
Oh, I'll get it.

09:28.335 --> 09:30.001
- Hi, Lynn.
- Hi, Lizard.

09:30.003 --> 09:32.871
Mom, dad, this is Lizard.

09:32.873 --> 09:34.372
Hello, Lizard.

09:34.374 --> 09:36.608
Oh, no, uh,
you can call me Eric.

09:36.610 --> 09:39.010
You see, he got his nickname
in Biology class

09:39.012 --> 09:41.212
because he removed
a brain tumor from a lizard.

09:41.214 --> 09:42.247
Now it's as good as new.

09:42.249 --> 09:44.115
Yeah, well, not really.

09:44.117 --> 09:46.484
It can only, uh,
flick its tongue to the left.

09:48.255 --> 09:51.423
Very good. Even so that's really
quite an achievement.

09:51.425 --> 09:53.625
Oh, tell them about the iguana.

09:53.627 --> 09:55.260
- Nah.
- Tell 'em.

09:55.262 --> 10:00.298
Ah, nothin', you know, it's just
a simple bypass surgery.

10:00.300 --> 10:01.800
You must be very good at
Biology.

10:01.802 --> 10:04.536
Were you, were you thinking
of becoming a surgeon?

10:04.538 --> 10:06.938
Yeah, I thought about it but,
uh, Quantum Physics

10:06.940 --> 10:09.240
is my first love.

10:09.242 --> 10:12.410
Young man, you may not only
date my daughter

10:12.412 --> 10:14.145
you may have her hand
in marriage.

10:14.147 --> 10:15.747
- Oh.
- Dad.

10:15.749 --> 10:17.816
[laughing]

10:17.818 --> 10:19.284
(Kate)
So glad you're here.

10:22.923 --> 10:24.322
Howdy, partner.

10:24.324 --> 10:27.292
- 'Hey!'
- Hey-hey, Ed.

10:27.294 --> 10:28.827
- Bernice.
- Hi!

10:28.829 --> 10:30.962
Look at you guys.

10:30.964 --> 10:32.564
- You're wearing costumes.
- Yeah.

10:32.566 --> 10:34.566
But we call them duds.

10:36.069 --> 10:37.836
Well, um,
why don't we mosey on over

10:37.838 --> 10:39.471
and rustle up some brie.

10:41.508 --> 10:43.208
[doorbell rings]

10:45.345 --> 10:47.812
- Hello.
- Who are you?

10:47.814 --> 10:49.014
We're the Burkes.

10:49.016 --> 10:50.415
Kate, it's my boss.

10:50.417 --> 10:52.317
This must be Brian.

10:52.319 --> 10:55.286
You're growing up too fast.

10:55.288 --> 10:57.822
That's it.
I'm going to bed.

10:57.824 --> 10:59.357
Did you invite them?

10:59.359 --> 11:01.926
- Of course not!
- Well, why is he here then?

11:01.928 --> 11:04.262
And why
are they wearing costumes?

11:04.264 --> 11:06.965
Maybe they're just
trick-or-treating.

11:06.967 --> 11:08.099
What-what am I supposed to do?

11:08.101 --> 11:09.134
Offer them a peanut butter cup

11:09.136 --> 11:11.169
and send them on their way?

11:12.472 --> 11:14.372
- 'Hello, Tanner.'
- Hello.

11:14.374 --> 11:15.473
Thank you for inviting us.

11:15.475 --> 11:18.476
Well, you're welcome,
Your Majesties.

11:18.478 --> 11:20.679
Uh, w-won't you
make yourself at home?

11:20.681 --> 11:23.314
Our castle is your castle.

11:23.316 --> 11:25.283
[doorbell rings]

11:27.521 --> 11:29.888
How come you told me
this was a costume party?

11:29.890 --> 11:32.957
Because that's what
the invitation said.

11:32.959 --> 11:34.859
Make yourself at home,
won't you?

11:34.861 --> 11:36.327
Kate..

11:36.329 --> 11:38.229
...uh, somebody seems to have

11:38.231 --> 11:40.899
invited the Burkes
and also told all these people

11:40.901 --> 11:42.367
that they should
be wearing costumes.

11:42.369 --> 11:44.536
Now, I don't know who that was,
or why he did it

11:44.538 --> 11:47.038
but I'm gonna go into
the garage and strangle him.

11:47.040 --> 11:49.274
[doorbell rings]

11:50.377 --> 11:52.310
Kate, Willie!

11:53.647 --> 11:55.046
Gordon Shumway.

11:55.048 --> 11:56.748
Long time no see.

11:58.518 --> 12:00.752
Oh, hope you don't mind, Willie.
I parked behind your boss.

12:06.760 --> 12:09.394
Hey, how are you folks?
Hey, you look good in vinyl.

12:09.396 --> 12:11.496
How you doing?
Nice to meet you.

12:11.498 --> 12:13.998
Hey, happy Halloween everybody!

12:14.000 --> 12:15.266
(all)
Happy Halloween!

12:15.268 --> 12:18.670
Say, what are you..

12:18.672 --> 12:20.105
...doing here?

12:20.107 --> 12:22.540
Greeting the guests. Hey, tex!

12:22.542 --> 12:25.076
Looks like you're putting
on a little weight there, huh?

12:25.078 --> 12:27.345
Ha, ha, ha!

12:27.347 --> 12:28.747
Could I speak with you
in the kitchen

12:28.749 --> 12:29.881
just for a moment?

12:29.883 --> 12:31.416
Hey, not now, Willie.

12:31.418 --> 12:33.118
Your pumpkin's on fire.

12:33.120 --> 12:35.553
Hah! His pumpkin's on fire!

12:35.555 --> 12:37.589
Come here!

12:37.591 --> 12:39.457
Well, who is this little guy?

12:39.459 --> 12:41.292
Oh, this is Gordon, everyone.

12:41.294 --> 12:44.195
Gordon's an old friend
of our family.

12:44.197 --> 12:45.797
Bernice, uh,
don't mention his height.

12:45.799 --> 12:47.766
He's very sensitive.

12:47.768 --> 12:50.235
Hey, cowgirl, nice calves.

12:50.237 --> 12:52.470
Hah! Nice calves!

12:52.472 --> 12:53.638
[laughs]

12:53.640 --> 12:55.373
- Easy.
- Oh!

12:59.079 --> 13:01.646
Okay, mister,
I want the truth!

13:01.648 --> 13:02.714
And I want it now!

13:03.984 --> 13:05.250
Alright.

13:05.252 --> 13:07.485
Your hair is thinning.

13:08.722 --> 13:11.089
You got a hold
of our guest list, didn't you?

13:11.091 --> 13:12.924
You called those people

13:12.926 --> 13:14.659
and told them to wear costumes

13:14.661 --> 13:16.728
just so you could come.

13:16.730 --> 13:19.497
You dragged me in here to tell
me things I already know?

13:21.234 --> 13:24.903
On top of that,
you invited the Burkes!

13:24.905 --> 13:27.205
Again, old news.

13:29.009 --> 13:32.510
Just...tell me why.

13:32.512 --> 13:35.613
Because I really want you
to get that promotion.

13:35.615 --> 13:38.750
Now-now get out there
and start kissing up.

13:38.752 --> 13:39.751
[kissing]

13:41.621 --> 13:43.488
I'm not kissing up to anyone.

13:43.490 --> 13:46.024
Especially, not Walter Burke!

13:46.026 --> 13:47.525
I knew you wouldn't.

13:47.527 --> 13:49.627
That's why I'm here
to do it for you.

13:49.629 --> 13:51.462
Oh, Wally! Wally!

13:51.464 --> 13:53.498
No, wait! Wait.

13:53.500 --> 13:54.599
You can't go out there.

13:54.601 --> 13:57.435
What if they discover
that you're an alien?

13:57.437 --> 14:00.638
They won't! They'll think
I'm wearing a costume.

14:00.640 --> 14:01.573
See?

14:03.543 --> 14:05.310
Where-where did you
get that zipper?

14:05.312 --> 14:07.612
Well, you know that old jacket
that you were gonna throw out?

14:07.614 --> 14:09.514
- Yeah.
- Better hang on to it.

14:09.516 --> 14:12.283
I ripped this out
of your new raincoat.

14:12.285 --> 14:13.518
Alright, go on.
Go out there.

14:13.520 --> 14:17.622
I don't care.
Go on. Fine with me!

14:17.624 --> 14:20.158
Blow your cover, that's fine!
Just do me one favor.

14:20.160 --> 14:24.596
Okay, okay.
I'll do my Elvis impression.

14:25.498 --> 14:28.867
Please, keep away from my boss.

14:28.869 --> 14:31.636
No problem.
He seems like a yutz, anyway.

14:33.707 --> 14:37.375
(ALF)
'Okay, everybody,
let's tear this place apart.'

14:41.014 --> 14:43.314
- Hi. Come in.
- Hi.

14:43.316 --> 14:44.916
Mom, look who's here.

14:46.653 --> 14:48.519
[laughing]

14:48.521 --> 14:52.523
Well, that's a pretty funny
costume you got yourself, Gordo.

14:52.525 --> 14:54.359
What are those? Warts?

14:54.361 --> 14:56.761
Hey, time for that eye exam
there, Edsel!

14:56.763 --> 14:58.329
Those are beauty marks!

14:58.331 --> 15:00.265
[laughing]

15:00.267 --> 15:02.433
What are you supposed to be,
exactly?

15:02.435 --> 15:04.736
An alien,
from the planet Melmac!

15:07.674 --> 15:09.007
He's just kidding.

15:09.009 --> 15:13.244
Yeah! Everyone knows that
Melmacians don't have zippers!

15:13.246 --> 15:15.113
[laughing]

15:15.115 --> 15:17.282
Oh, I kill me. Ha!

15:22.722 --> 15:24.522
Mom says that we're
out of onion dip

15:24.524 --> 15:26.624
and we need more meatballs,
and how do you like Lizard?

15:26.626 --> 15:27.692
I like him.

15:27.694 --> 15:29.794
He's intelligent, he's polite

15:29.796 --> 15:31.362
he's well-groomed.

15:31.364 --> 15:32.630
Does he have a van?

15:32.632 --> 15:33.731
No.

15:33.733 --> 15:35.366
I love him.

15:36.403 --> 15:37.435
What's ALF doing?

15:37.437 --> 15:39.570
Oh, his Elvis impression.

15:39.572 --> 15:43.608
¶ And on a cold
and gray Chicago morning.. ¶¶

15:43.610 --> 15:45.209
Lynn..

15:45.211 --> 15:46.611
...you are missing..

15:46.613 --> 15:47.946
..."In The Ghetto."

15:47.948 --> 15:49.948
Oh, my favorite.

15:53.620 --> 15:55.620
We don't lead a normal life.

15:59.092 --> 16:01.092
[applauding]

16:01.094 --> 16:02.126
Well, thank you.

16:02.128 --> 16:03.628
Thank you very much, ladies.

16:03.630 --> 16:05.430
I'd like to dedicate
that last song

16:05.432 --> 16:08.399
to my hunk
of burning love, Bernice.

16:08.401 --> 16:10.802
Oh, Elvis!

16:10.804 --> 16:13.638
Love me tender.

16:13.640 --> 16:14.839
I will, momma.

16:14.841 --> 16:16.274
Uh, but now, excuse me.

16:16.276 --> 16:17.675
I've got to work the room.

16:17.677 --> 16:19.010
¶ Oh ho ¶

16:19.012 --> 16:20.411
¶ Oh hoo ¶¶

16:20.413 --> 16:22.580
Oh, ha-ha! Yeah.

16:22.582 --> 16:24.649
Hey-hey, so what did
you think there, Liz?

16:24.651 --> 16:27.285
Whoo! The king lives.

16:27.287 --> 16:29.687
Thanks. Hey, science question.

16:29.689 --> 16:32.323
If there were such a thing
as an alien life form

16:32.325 --> 16:34.158
what do you think he'd be like?

16:34.160 --> 16:36.494
- Huh?
- Come on, what are you, deaf?

16:36.496 --> 16:38.529
I'm trying to get some insight.

16:38.531 --> 16:40.665
You're an egghead, aren't you?

16:40.667 --> 16:43.968
Yeah, I do well scholastically,
if that's what you mean.

16:43.970 --> 16:46.637
Yeah, right. What about aliens?

16:46.639 --> 16:48.373
They'd probably have
highly developed brains

16:48.375 --> 16:50.341
and be very advanced.

16:50.343 --> 16:51.876
Well, thank you.

16:55.048 --> 16:56.147
Oh, good, more food.

16:56.149 --> 16:58.282
Sorry, Gordo.

16:58.284 --> 17:00.618
We weren't expecting
this many guests.

17:00.620 --> 17:01.886
Well, you're telling me.

17:01.888 --> 17:04.522
Your boss eats like
he's going to the chair.

17:05.892 --> 17:07.892
Incidentally, how's the, uh..

17:07.894 --> 17:09.060
[kissing]

17:09.062 --> 17:10.862
...kissing up going?

17:10.864 --> 17:12.563
I'm not kissing up to anyone.

17:12.565 --> 17:15.166
I haven't done anything wrong.

17:15.168 --> 17:17.435
Play hardball. I like it.

17:19.139 --> 17:22.373
[humming]

17:22.976 --> 17:24.308
Hi.

17:24.310 --> 17:26.210
Oh, you mind
if I take one of these?

17:26.212 --> 17:28.279
Hey, why hold back now?

17:33.420 --> 17:34.819
I can't believe it.

17:34.821 --> 17:36.687
ALF is actually going to put

17:36.689 --> 17:39.524
a lamp shade on his head.

17:39.526 --> 17:43.027
That is probably
the corniest party gag there is.

17:43.029 --> 17:46.030
[people laughing]

17:46.032 --> 17:48.166
But somehow he makes it work.

17:48.168 --> 17:51.269
He's the life...of this party.

17:51.271 --> 17:53.438
Even Walter Burke
is having a good time.

17:53.440 --> 17:56.541
Honey, you might get
that promotion after all.

17:56.543 --> 17:59.310
Sounds like ALF
might get the promotion.

18:00.613 --> 18:02.880
I don't wanna work for ALF.

18:02.882 --> 18:05.249
We already do.

18:05.251 --> 18:07.885
(in unison)
Gordo! Gordo! Gordo!

18:07.887 --> 18:10.721
Gordo! Gordo! Gordo!

18:10.723 --> 18:14.092
Gordo! Go! Go! Go!

18:14.094 --> 18:16.194
[all cheering]

18:16.196 --> 18:17.628
Hey, thank you.

18:17.630 --> 18:19.230
You know,
we couldn't do this back home.

18:19.232 --> 18:20.631
Of course, we didn't have
any gravity.

18:20.633 --> 18:23.034
'Ha! Ha!'

18:23.036 --> 18:24.969
Hey, just kidding, Tanners.

18:24.971 --> 18:27.371
'Ha! Alright, who's next?'

18:27.373 --> 18:29.941
Who's next? Uh, hey,
how about Walter Burke?

18:29.943 --> 18:31.742
- Oh, no.
- Yeah!

18:31.744 --> 18:33.544
No, no, no.

18:33.546 --> 18:34.579
- Not Walter!
- 'Walter!'

18:34.581 --> 18:35.746
- 'Not Walter!'
- Walter!

18:35.748 --> 18:38.049
- Not Walter!
- 'Walter! Walter!'

18:38.051 --> 18:39.450
Come on, Walter.
Give it a try.

18:39.452 --> 18:41.486
No, I got this..
What about my bad back, huh?

18:41.488 --> 18:43.921
Oh, go for it.
It-it's Halloween.

18:43.923 --> 18:47.325
- 'Yeah.'
- Yeah, what are you, a wuss?

18:47.327 --> 18:49.827
- 'Come on, Walter.'
- 'Come on, Walter!'

18:49.829 --> 18:51.829
- Yay!
- Be a man!

18:51.831 --> 18:53.131
- Yes!
- Alright.

18:53.133 --> 18:54.632
- Come on!
- Alright, alright.

18:54.634 --> 18:59.437
(in unison)
And go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

18:59.439 --> 19:01.973
(Walter)
Ow! Oh..

19:01.975 --> 19:03.341
- 'Oh, my God.'
- 'Oh.'

19:03.343 --> 19:05.843
Mr. Burke, are you alright?

19:05.845 --> 19:08.679
Just get me to a hard,
flat surface.

19:08.681 --> 19:12.750
Hey, don't expect high marks
on technique, Wally.

19:12.752 --> 19:14.719
[indistinct chatter]

19:16.623 --> 19:19.790
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

19:19.792 --> 19:20.691
[sighs]

19:22.762 --> 19:25.363
Lizard, isn't there anything
you can do?

19:25.365 --> 19:27.732
Hmm, I-I could remove his brain.

19:29.669 --> 19:31.102
Gordo, be careful.

19:31.104 --> 19:32.837
I know what I'm doing.

19:32.839 --> 19:35.606
Ahh. Feels good.

19:35.608 --> 19:37.108
- It does?
- Yeah.

19:37.110 --> 19:38.509
Go figure.

19:39.312 --> 19:40.511
May I use the phone?

19:40.513 --> 19:42.813
I-I wanna call Walter's doctor.

19:42.815 --> 19:44.815
Is it a local call?

19:44.817 --> 19:48.786
Gordo! I'll show
you where it is, Felicia.

19:48.788 --> 19:51.389
Leave 20 cents
on the night table.

19:51.958 --> 19:54.158
Ah, Gordo..

19:54.160 --> 19:55.359
...how can I thank you?

19:55.361 --> 19:56.694
Easy!

19:56.696 --> 19:59.830
Bury the hatchet
and give Willie that promotion.

19:59.832 --> 20:02.500
We both know
he's the best man for the job.

20:02.502 --> 20:05.903
He's intelligent,
hard-working, honest--

20:05.905 --> 20:07.205
ALF.

20:07.207 --> 20:08.906
Bad with names.

20:08.908 --> 20:11.576
It's Gordo, remember?

20:11.578 --> 20:13.711
I think Mr. Burke's
heard quite enough from you.

20:14.647 --> 20:17.081
You're right. It's your turn.

20:17.083 --> 20:19.217
Go ahead, Willie. Be obsequious.

20:19.219 --> 20:21.686
I have nothing
to be obsequious about.

20:21.688 --> 20:23.688
I was taken away
from an important project

20:23.690 --> 20:26.190
to look for some
stupid water cooler!

20:26.192 --> 20:28.893
- You're still mad about that?
- You bet I am.

20:28.895 --> 20:32.029
You took away something I'd
worked on for three months

20:32.031 --> 20:34.565
because you didn't happen
to like tap water.

20:34.567 --> 20:37.201
Willie, maybe I should
define obsequious for you.

20:37.203 --> 20:38.569
It means to grovel.

20:40.373 --> 20:41.906
I will not grovel.

20:41.908 --> 20:43.841
I never knew
how strongly you felt.

20:43.843 --> 20:46.444
Alright, you can have
your project back.

20:46.446 --> 20:48.179
- I can?
- 'Yes.'

20:48.181 --> 20:50.348
Well, thanks.

20:50.350 --> 20:52.016
I guess that settles that.

20:52.018 --> 20:54.552
Hey, wait a minute!
Loose end here.

20:54.554 --> 20:56.621
What about the promotion?

20:56.623 --> 20:58.756
Uh, the promotion's
a whole separate issue.

20:58.758 --> 21:00.424
We can discuss that later.

21:00.426 --> 21:02.627
What better time?
He's in pain.

21:02.629 --> 21:04.695
We can get anything we want.

21:04.697 --> 21:07.565
We'll discuss the promotion
at another time.

21:07.567 --> 21:10.534
It's alright, Tanner.
You've got your promotion.

21:10.536 --> 21:12.370
I never felt otherwise.

21:12.372 --> 21:14.739
Oh, good.

21:14.741 --> 21:16.974
- Would you get me more ice?
- Yes, sure.

21:16.976 --> 21:19.710
And this time would you put it
in a glass with a little scotch?

21:22.649 --> 21:24.749
You know,
as long as you're here, Burke

21:24.751 --> 21:26.651
there's a few other things
Willie needs.

21:28.421 --> 21:29.453
Like what?

21:29.455 --> 21:32.657
Well, let's talk parking spaces.

21:32.659 --> 21:34.725
Willie has a parking space.

21:34.727 --> 21:37.161
Yeah, but it's not close enough.

21:37.163 --> 21:40.431
And I understand his office
doesn't even have a window.

21:40.433 --> 21:41.999
Well, neither does mine.

21:42.001 --> 21:43.968
That's your problem.

21:43.970 --> 21:46.003
And Willie's not nuts
about that guy

21:46.005 --> 21:47.271
that works next to him.

21:47.273 --> 21:48.806
Uh, what's his name? Uh--

21:48.808 --> 21:50.941
- Simmons?
- Yeah, yeah, Simmons.

21:50.943 --> 21:52.009
That's the guy.

21:52.011 --> 21:53.411
He's not pulling his weight.

21:53.413 --> 21:54.679
Get rid of him!

21:54.681 --> 21:57.415
There's a parking space
right there.

21:57.417 --> 21:59.917
Oh, yeah, yeah,
and let's talk overtime.

21:59.919 --> 22:00.785
Overtime?

22:00.787 --> 22:02.820
OT. Yeah!

22:02.822 --> 22:03.954
Overtime.

22:03.956 --> 22:05.756
Willie's working too hard.

22:05.758 --> 22:07.158
I mean, he doesn't get home

22:07.160 --> 22:09.694
till 7:30-8 o'clock
at night I hear.

22:09.696 --> 22:11.762
I mean, what are you guys
doing down there?

22:11.764 --> 22:14.465
Give the guy a break!

22:14.467 --> 22:15.900
How's your back?

22:19.372 --> 22:20.938
Come on, Willie.

22:20.940 --> 22:22.807
No, ALF, uh, it's too risky!

22:22.809 --> 22:24.442
I think we'd better go.

22:24.444 --> 22:25.843
Hey, you owe me.

22:25.845 --> 22:28.612
After all, I got you
an office with a window.

22:28.614 --> 22:30.314
But I liked Simmons.

22:30.316 --> 22:32.616
I really did.

22:32.618 --> 22:35.019
Trick or treat?
Trick or treat?

22:35.021 --> 22:36.721
ALF, your voice!

22:36.723 --> 22:38.356
You're supposed to be a child.

22:38.358 --> 22:39.890
Right. No problem.

22:41.728 --> 22:43.661
Hello, young man.

22:43.663 --> 22:45.096
Hello, old woman.

22:46.733 --> 22:49.567
We're terribly sorry
to bother you so late

22:49.569 --> 22:52.136
but we-we couldn't
get out any earlier.

22:52.138 --> 22:53.704
Oh, well, I'm afraid that I gave

22:53.706 --> 22:57.541
my last candy bar away
over an hour ago.

22:57.543 --> 22:59.910
Aw, shucks.

22:59.912 --> 23:02.646
Well, I'll see
if I can find something else.

23:02.648 --> 23:04.215
[cats mewing]

23:04.217 --> 23:05.816
Was that a cat?

23:05.818 --> 23:08.085
Oh, yes, I have lots of cats.

23:11.758 --> 23:13.758
Well, I'll take a yellow one.

23:23.936 --> 23:25.936
