00:32.101 --> 00:34.972
- Can I help you?
- Well, I called for her last night.

00:36.564 --> 00:38.224
Her husband died last night.

00:38.817 --> 00:41.882
His picture was in the paper once,
but you misspelled his name.

00:41.986 --> 00:43.967
She wants to be sure you get it right.

00:44.072 --> 00:47.304
- You see, it's not one, but two "I"s.
- You want obituaries.

00:47.408 --> 00:49.982
It's the guy in the back
with the urn on his desk.

00:52.330 --> 00:54.453
What funeral home was she taken to?

00:55.333 --> 00:56.448
How old was she?

00:59.045 --> 01:00.290
What did she die of?

01:01.422 --> 01:04.542
Well, I have to know what she died of
or I can't write the obit.

01:05.385 --> 01:06.962
I don't make the rules.

01:07.887 --> 01:10.378
Could I call you back? Thank you.

01:17.021 --> 01:18.432
Excuse me, will you?

01:20.733 --> 01:21.764
Tom?

01:22.569 --> 01:24.884
Tom, look, I cannot take this anymore.

01:24.988 --> 01:28.303
You got to get me off the obit desk.
I can't write another obituary.

01:28.408 --> 01:31.390
Calm down, Adam. Relax.
It isn't going to last forever.

01:31.494 --> 01:32.766
Think of it this way:

01:32.871 --> 01:37.118
This is your last chance in journalism
to write anything nice about anybody.

01:38.126 --> 01:39.122
Perfect.

03:02.877 --> 03:04.900
New York City - Five Years Later

03:05.004 --> 03:06.986
So, you can't talk to me about the arrest.

03:07.090 --> 03:10.791
Can you talk to me about after the arrest?
You know, his time in prison.

03:10.969 --> 03:12.249
It was terrible.

03:12.929 --> 03:15.337
He was in shock the entire time.

03:17.100 --> 03:19.971
He lost a lot of weight
because he couldn't eat the food.

03:21.187 --> 03:22.350
He couldn't sleep.

03:23.022 --> 03:26.308
They had him in the same cell
with a Mafia hit man.

03:27.026 --> 03:29.980
- He was afraid to close his eyes for a week.
- Interesting.

03:30.446 --> 03:31.941
For a man like him...

03:32.657 --> 03:34.863
that was cruel and unusual punishment.

03:35.535 --> 03:36.863
I'll say.

03:37.912 --> 03:41.079
What do you think, Charlie?
Can you get him to talk to me?

03:41.708 --> 03:43.950
He's not talking to any press, Adam.

03:44.627 --> 03:46.122
He doesn't trust you guys.

03:46.588 --> 03:47.750
I don't blame him.

03:48.381 --> 03:50.421
There's been a lot of bad press lately.

03:50.967 --> 03:53.615
I thought he'd want to tell
his side of the story.

03:53.720 --> 03:55.826
The only way to do that is an interview.

03:55.930 --> 03:59.382
Especially if he feels that the government
is screwing around on him.

03:59.767 --> 04:02.389
Now, I didn't exactly say that.

04:03.730 --> 04:06.102
Anyway, not for the record.

04:06.649 --> 04:09.223
I don't want you to twist
what I said out of shape.

04:09.861 --> 04:10.940
Right.

04:12.071 --> 04:15.888
The problem is, the only people that
will talk to me are people that hate him.

04:15.992 --> 04:18.661
And I'm doing this story
whether I talk to him or not.

04:19.077 --> 04:21.451
So don't fault me
if this is a negative piece.

04:22.499 --> 04:24.521
That sounds vaguely like a threat.

04:24.626 --> 04:28.754
No, I think that if he wants a chance,
he's got to turn his press around.

04:30.715 --> 04:33.123
You reporters think
you make the world turn.

04:33.551 --> 04:34.927
I don't know about that.

04:35.595 --> 04:38.133
You know,
I used to be a reporter myself...

04:38.806 --> 04:41.095
until I got tired of starving my family.

04:41.518 --> 04:44.187
That's why I got into public relations.

04:44.854 --> 04:48.603
- To make a living wage. I love it.
- Yeah.

04:48.983 --> 04:50.181
I really do.

04:53.029 --> 04:55.816
Excuse me. I have to take a piss.

05:36.364 --> 05:40.065
- Am I interrupting something?
- No. Adam, come on in and look at this.

05:48.376 --> 05:51.942
- Frankie strikes again.
- Look at that. They're good.

05:52.046 --> 05:54.882
At last someone has managed
to capture his true essence.

05:55.008 --> 05:58.240
Look at this one.
I can't believe that she got him to do this.

05:58.344 --> 06:00.004
Believe me, it was easy.

06:01.764 --> 06:04.220
I think this will be the one
we use on the cover.

06:05.810 --> 06:07.435
- You like it?
- I like it.

06:07.896 --> 06:09.710
- You want to get some lunch?
- Yeah.

06:09.814 --> 06:12.087
- Frankie, you want to join us?
- Absolutely.

06:12.192 --> 06:13.922
How did it go this morning?

06:14.027 --> 06:14.965
Fascinating.

06:15.069 --> 06:18.719
He insisted we meet at the Atrium Club,
saying it was a safe place to talk.

06:18.823 --> 06:22.765
He implied the government had a reason
for putting McKenzie out of business.

06:22.869 --> 06:24.016
He was so nervous.

06:24.120 --> 06:27.121
- But what about the interview?
- He thought it was doubtful.

06:27.415 --> 06:30.481
- There's no story without an interview.
- Or without pictures.

06:30.585 --> 06:33.400
You don't want to recycle
the same wire service photos.

06:33.505 --> 06:36.904
- I'd love to shoot him.
- You'd make him pose with coke in his lap.

06:37.008 --> 06:40.294
- I can make him do anything.
- Come on, you guys.

06:48.186 --> 06:48.999
I have an idea.

06:49.103 --> 06:52.722
McKenzie has a hearing tomorrow,
in Los Angeles, to reduce his bail.

06:52.857 --> 06:55.255
But he needs the $2 million
to pay his lawyers.

06:55.360 --> 06:58.133
Why don't I fly out there tonight
and get the interview?

06:58.238 --> 07:01.303
- You hate flying.
- I'm fine, as long as there's no turbulence.

07:01.407 --> 07:03.764
When it starts bouncing around,
I get drunk.

07:03.868 --> 07:07.351
If you're going, let's find a story
for you to do at the same time...

07:07.455 --> 07:11.583
in case it doesn't work out. I don't want
you wasting your time or my money.

07:11.709 --> 07:14.960
You cheap fuck.
You want two stories for the price of one?

07:15.088 --> 07:16.026
Fine.

07:16.130 --> 07:19.321
I have an idea for a story
that would take place in California.

07:19.425 --> 07:20.197
What?

07:20.301 --> 07:22.700
I got the idea at the Atrium Club,
this morning.

07:22.804 --> 07:25.285
- Who would you be going after?
- Not who, what.

07:25.390 --> 07:28.307
- Excuse me, what will you be going after?
- Health clubs.

07:28.768 --> 07:30.082
- Groan.
- No.

07:30.186 --> 07:33.961
I'll do a story about how they're
turning into the singles bars of the '80s?

07:34.065 --> 07:36.296
Find a couple.
Do a non-fiction love story.

07:36.401 --> 07:39.341
- With pictures.
- Lots of them. It could be hilarious.

07:39.445 --> 07:43.178
Particularly set in Los Angeles.
You know, inflated bodies. Airheads.

07:43.283 --> 07:45.431
- Hot tubs? Alfalfa sprouts?
- Absolutely.

07:45.535 --> 07:48.475
We haven't done L.A. in a long time.
It would be wonderful.

07:48.580 --> 07:49.825
- Sounds great.
- Shit.

07:49.998 --> 07:52.313
- What?
- Carly Simon just walked in.

07:52.417 --> 07:53.330
Oh, God.

07:53.501 --> 07:57.499
- She hated the story you did on her.
- I know, I know.

08:13.980 --> 08:15.723
- Hi, Carly.
- Hi, Carly.

08:16.107 --> 08:17.021
Hi, Carly.

08:17.484 --> 08:20.591
- I read that shit you wrote about me.
- Come on, Carly.

08:20.695 --> 08:24.230
The only thing worse than being
written about is not being written about.

08:44.969 --> 08:47.756
There is a motion with respect to the bail
for Mr. McKenzie.

08:47.889 --> 08:49.745
- Is that correct?
- It is, Your Honour.

08:49.849 --> 08:51.889
- Yes. Is there a written motion?
- No.

08:53.645 --> 08:55.417
I'd like to make an oral presentation.

08:55.522 --> 08:57.561
- You filed the notice?
- Yes, Your Honour.

08:57.690 --> 09:00.089
All right, then, go ahead
and state your reasons.

09:00.193 --> 09:01.901
Then the government may reply.

09:02.070 --> 09:05.236
We are seeking a reduction in bail
based on two major things:

09:05.615 --> 09:09.280
One, Mr. McKenzie is simply
not as wealthy as the government...

09:09.410 --> 09:11.642
and the press, for that matter, imagines.

09:11.746 --> 09:15.411
Let's leave the press out of it.
They have nothing to do with setting bail.

09:16.209 --> 09:17.917
Here they come.

09:24.592 --> 09:27.908
- Charlie, what about the interview?
- He's not talking to anybody.

09:28.012 --> 09:30.744
- Period.
- If he changes his mind, I'll be at...

09:30.849 --> 09:33.803
He's not changing his mind.
He's flying to New York today.

09:34.352 --> 09:35.930
The Sunset Marquis.

09:36.855 --> 09:38.265
The Sunset Marquis!

09:57.167 --> 09:57.938
Hello.

09:58.042 --> 09:59.667
- <i>Adam?</i>
- Yeah.

09:59.794 --> 10:02.166
- <i>How's it going?</i>
- It's going fine.

10:02.297 --> 10:04.820
He got his bail reduced,
but I couldn't talk to him.

10:04.924 --> 10:06.655
He had to go back to New York.

10:06.759 --> 10:10.534
I'm working on some other angles.
I'm trying to locate some friends of his.

10:10.638 --> 10:12.595
I started the piece. It's real good.

10:12.765 --> 10:16.123
- In other words, no interview?
- Come on, Mark, please.

10:16.227 --> 10:18.959
The story is great,
and the material I have is terrific.

10:19.063 --> 10:22.755
- It should be a cover.
- You get the interview and we'll talk cover.

10:22.859 --> 10:26.192
Simon & Schuster just made an inquiry
for me to do this as a book.

10:26.488 --> 10:27.593
Cover would help.

10:27.697 --> 10:29.903
I'm not in the goddamn book business.

10:30.492 --> 10:34.276
- Have you found a health club yet?
- <i>Yes, I found an ad in the phone book.</i>

10:35.038 --> 10:37.161
The club's name is The Sports Connection.

10:37.624 --> 10:40.459
"Health club, racquetball, and good times.

10:40.710 --> 10:42.983
"We're a totally new concept
in athletic club.

10:43.087 --> 10:45.527
"We're more than a club,
we're a lifestyle."

10:45.632 --> 10:49.581
Then it has this illustration of a couple
in sports clothes hugging each other.

10:50.053 --> 10:51.084
It sounds perfect.

10:52.555 --> 10:54.787
<i>What kind of story are you planning to do?</i>

10:54.891 --> 10:58.040
<i>Maybe something about
couples meeting here, falling in love</i>

10:58.144 --> 11:00.292
- <i>getting married.</i>
- <i>That sounds good.</i>

11:00.396 --> 11:04.046
<i>Let's go down and get you a membership,
so you can see what's happening.</i>

11:04.150 --> 11:05.728
<i>Now that sounds even better.</i>

11:06.694 --> 11:09.551
Nanette, where did you get this idea
to make this place...

11:09.656 --> 11:12.147
more than a health club,
like your ad says?

11:12.283 --> 11:16.392
I looked around the city and I saw
that people had had it with singles bars.

11:16.496 --> 11:19.687
They even had the supermarkets
staked out. That was getting boring.

11:19.791 --> 11:20.521
Really?

11:20.625 --> 11:24.316
There wasn't anywhere people could
get together in a healthy environment...

11:24.420 --> 11:26.413
and have some social interaction.

11:28.091 --> 11:30.463
- Right.
- Mr. Lawrence, hold it.

11:31.177 --> 11:34.785
Michael and I, he's my partner,
thought it'd be great to create a place...

11:34.889 --> 11:37.538
like the lodge at the bottom of the hill
in Aspen.

11:37.642 --> 11:39.957
Where people could share
a common interest.

11:40.061 --> 11:41.583
- All right.
- Phone, Nanette.

11:41.688 --> 11:43.252
- Take a message, okay?
- Okay.

11:43.356 --> 11:46.380
My concept was to get people
out of their potato chip bags...

11:46.484 --> 11:50.009
into the club by convincing them
it didn't have to be drudgery.

11:50.113 --> 11:51.719
- That it could be fun.
- Right.

11:51.823 --> 11:54.444
- I'll get somebody to show you around.
- Sounds good.

11:55.869 --> 11:59.949
We have nine racquetball courts.
These two courts are our challenge courts.

12:00.081 --> 12:02.521
- The winner stays on, loser gets off.
- Really?

12:02.625 --> 12:04.231
Then, you have a lounge area.

12:04.335 --> 12:07.870
It's a good place to sit and relax,
before and after your workout.

12:08.256 --> 12:11.127
Your entrance and registration area.

12:11.968 --> 12:15.951
And then we have Pete's Pro Shop.
They have the latest in workout apparel...

12:16.055 --> 12:17.882
and racquetball equipment.

12:18.183 --> 12:21.749
Then you have the snack bar.
They have fruit juices, great smoothies.

12:21.853 --> 12:23.876
- Beer and wine?
- No wine, just beer.

12:23.980 --> 12:26.253
- You can get a beer after your workout.
- Good.

12:26.357 --> 12:28.213
- And great sandwiches.
- Sprouts?

12:28.318 --> 12:29.423
- Definitely.
- Yes.

12:29.527 --> 12:31.884
- Are you into health food?
- No, not really.

12:31.988 --> 12:34.136
Okay, let's look at Body Dynamics.

12:34.240 --> 12:36.889
What they do in here
is personal fitness assessments.

12:36.993 --> 12:40.267
They do cardiovascular testing,
nutritional analysis...

12:40.371 --> 12:43.354
hydrostatic weighing,
or weighing the body underwater.

12:43.458 --> 12:45.773
It helps determine
your percentage of body fat.

12:45.877 --> 12:47.870
Then, you have
an hour-and-a-half-long consultation.

12:48.963 --> 12:52.738
- And here we have the coed gym.
- So this is where all the action takes place.

12:52.842 --> 12:55.199
On the free weights,
the universal equipment...

12:55.303 --> 12:57.409
the Nautilus, and Icarian equipment.

12:57.514 --> 13:00.996
- I feel guilty, all these people working out.
- And the Lifecycle bikes.

13:01.100 --> 13:02.665
- Hi, Bobby.
- Hi, Linda.

13:02.769 --> 13:06.418
- I miss you. I never see you anymore.
- Adam, Linda. Linda, Adam.

13:06.523 --> 13:07.518
Hello, Linda.

13:07.857 --> 13:09.517
I mean it. I really miss you.

13:09.984 --> 13:13.384
I worked up here as an instructor
before I was promoted to sales.

13:13.488 --> 13:16.061
- I see.
- He used to work on my body.

13:16.991 --> 13:18.806
- Looking good.
- God knows, I try.

13:18.910 --> 13:22.955
I'm still in the "before" group,
not the "after," but I'm gonna get there.

13:23.623 --> 13:26.624
- Where's Sally?
- She's there, working out with Roger.

13:27.293 --> 13:29.963
- Trying to make her tits even bigger.
- Well, see you.

13:30.839 --> 13:32.569
- Nice meeting you.
- You, too.

13:32.674 --> 13:35.114
- What's her story?
- She was a mess.

13:35.218 --> 13:38.283
- What do you mean?
- No one works as hard to get in shape.

13:38.388 --> 13:40.795
- Really?
- Hi, Sally. Hi, Roger.

13:41.307 --> 13:43.872
- Five.
- He's killing me.

13:43.977 --> 13:47.809
- Come on, let's go, back to work.
- How many? Just three more.

13:48.773 --> 13:51.338
- That's a couple you should talk to.
- Who are they?

13:51.442 --> 13:54.258
Sally works with Linda
at the Apparel Mart, downtown.

13:54.362 --> 13:56.760
And Roger,
he's a stripper at Chippendales.

13:56.865 --> 14:00.364
- Interesting. I do want to talk to them.
- Nice people. They met here.

14:00.910 --> 14:04.059
- You'll have such a good time, I promise.
- Come on, come on!

14:04.164 --> 14:06.203
How big do you want them?

14:06.416 --> 14:09.898
Can I get a list of couples that met here,
and their phone numbers?

14:10.003 --> 14:13.444
- It's against policy to give phone numbers.
- Can't you bend the rules?

14:13.548 --> 14:15.195
I really don't have much time.

14:15.300 --> 14:17.156
- I'll see what I can do.
- Thank you.

14:17.260 --> 14:19.867
- Kenny, this is Adam Lawrence.
- How you doing?

14:19.971 --> 14:24.163
He's a reporter for <i>Rolling Stone.</i>
Kenny can answer questions if I'm not in.

14:24.267 --> 14:26.972
- Nanette said you're looking for couples.
- Yeah.

14:27.228 --> 14:28.667
I'm a big fan of yours.

14:28.771 --> 14:31.003
- Really?
- Yeah, I subscribe to <i>Rolling Stone.</i>

14:31.107 --> 14:34.340
I read your piece on Carly Simon.
I thought it was great.

14:34.444 --> 14:35.689
So did I.

14:41.910 --> 14:44.475
I bet lots of lustful matinees
get started here.

14:44.579 --> 14:49.407
- What? What do you mean?
- Excuse me, I mean, social interaction.

14:49.876 --> 14:52.165
- Let me show you the rest of the club.
- Okay.

14:52.837 --> 14:55.079
By the way,
what kind of story are you writing?

15:04.641 --> 15:07.048
This is aerobics and "slimnastics."

15:13.316 --> 15:14.596
That's Jessie Wilson.

15:14.859 --> 15:17.944
She's probably the best female instructor
we got right now.

15:21.866 --> 15:24.274
They call her "the Aerobics Pied Piper."

15:24.702 --> 15:27.324
- A lot of couples met in her class.
- Really?

15:30.708 --> 15:32.037
Turn it around.

15:35.588 --> 15:37.194
I'm going back to my workout.

15:37.298 --> 15:38.821
- Enjoy the class.
- Thanks.

15:38.925 --> 15:41.381
- Nice meeting you.
- It was very nice meeting you.

15:49.102 --> 15:51.675
Squeeze. Release. Squeeze. Release.

15:54.649 --> 15:55.894
Toes out!

16:00.613 --> 16:02.108
Shoulders down.

16:13.626 --> 16:15.334
Really tighten your thighs!

16:29.934 --> 16:31.049
Touch down!

16:35.023 --> 16:37.062
Straight leg, left. Go!

16:41.321 --> 16:43.112
Hold it down on two...

16:47.911 --> 16:49.239
Hold it!

16:53.249 --> 16:54.163
Let's go!

16:56.628 --> 16:58.537
- 'Night, Kim.
- Goodnight, Jessie.

16:59.339 --> 17:01.166
- Hi, Shirley.
- Hi, Jessie.

17:02.383 --> 17:03.297
Jessie.

17:03.676 --> 17:05.782
- Adam Lawrence. Hi.
- Hi.

17:05.887 --> 17:08.757
- I really enjoyed your class. You're great.
- Thanks.

17:09.348 --> 17:12.931
I'm a reporter for <i>Rolling Stone.</i>
I'm writing on the Sports Connection.

17:13.269 --> 17:14.249
- Really?
- Yeah.

17:14.354 --> 17:15.978
- <i>Rolling Stone</i> ?
- Yes.

17:16.647 --> 17:18.190
I'd love to interview you.

17:18.858 --> 17:20.233
- Why?
- Why not?

17:21.027 --> 17:24.561
- I can think of a lot of reasons.
- It would be good for business.

17:25.073 --> 17:26.318
Business is fine.

17:28.367 --> 17:30.989
You think about it.
I'll be around for a few days.

17:31.329 --> 17:34.034
I will, but I don't change my mind
about anything.

17:35.291 --> 17:36.999
Could you give me a reason why?

17:39.212 --> 17:40.754
I read magazines.

17:51.766 --> 17:55.040
<i>The Star Garden Club
is proud to present...</i>

17:55.145 --> 17:59.391
<i>direct from New York City,
the one and only...</i>

17:59.691 --> 18:00.971
<i>Shotsy.</i>

18:59.876 --> 19:01.774
- Jessie, hi.
- Hi.

19:01.878 --> 19:04.026
- Did you think about it?
- Very, very hard.

19:04.130 --> 19:05.874
- Did you change your mind?
- No.

19:06.508 --> 19:09.544
- Well, I'll get someone else to interview.
- I guess you will.

19:09.719 --> 19:13.035
Maybe you don't understand.
I may want you as the focus of my story.

19:13.139 --> 19:16.555
No, you don't understand.
I don't want to be the focus of anything.

19:16.768 --> 19:20.334
Okay, you don't have to be the focus.
I just need your viewpoint.

19:20.438 --> 19:23.128
Last time I counted,
there were 90 aerobic instructors.

19:23.233 --> 19:27.383
- But your classes are the biggest, sexiest...
- Are you deaf? No!

19:27.487 --> 19:29.978
- What's the problem?
- I was burned once.

19:30.281 --> 19:32.108
I don't intend to get burned again.

19:33.910 --> 19:38.406
- The battery's dead.
- No kidding. It happens all the time.

19:39.415 --> 19:40.874
Where's your car?

19:42.961 --> 19:44.787
I have jumper cables.

19:46.589 --> 19:47.653
- You okay?
- Yeah.

19:47.757 --> 19:51.340
I can never remember
which is positive or negative. Try that.

19:53.346 --> 19:55.255
- All right.
- Keep it going.

19:59.644 --> 20:01.684
Okay, I have an idea.

20:02.313 --> 20:04.461
I know you don't want to be interviewed.

20:04.566 --> 20:06.938
- But how about dinner tonight?
- Sorry.

20:07.735 --> 20:09.313
How about lunch tomorrow?

20:09.863 --> 20:12.318
- All off the record?
- Just like regular people.

20:21.374 --> 20:22.855
- Hello.
- Hi.

20:22.959 --> 20:25.733
I'm sorry to call so late,
but I just got your message.

20:25.837 --> 20:27.067
What's going on?

20:27.172 --> 20:29.045
- <i>Are you all right?</i>
- Yeah. Why?

20:29.382 --> 20:31.458
Hold on, I'm putting you on speaker.

20:32.510 --> 20:36.327
I got a call from a guy I know who's in
the shady end of the record business.

20:36.431 --> 20:40.164
He said you're ringing the wrong doorbells
and might end up in the hospital.

20:40.268 --> 20:41.466
Make sense to you?

20:41.769 --> 20:44.474
I don't know.
I've been poking around, but...

20:45.398 --> 20:48.422
I made contact
with one of his old girlfriends today.

20:48.526 --> 20:50.685
Maybe somebody's nervous about that.

20:50.945 --> 20:53.152
I called just to say watch yourself.

20:53.406 --> 20:56.638
I want you to promise me
you'll be real careful on this one, okay?

20:56.743 --> 20:59.316
Anyway, how's the other one?
Have you found a hook?

20:59.537 --> 21:02.645
Yeah, as a matter of fact.
I found this terrific opportunity.

21:02.749 --> 21:06.699
It's not the kind of story I had in mind
at first, but it's pretty good. Listen.

21:07.003 --> 21:11.665
There's a girl at the Sports Connection
who they call "the Aerobics Pied Piper."

21:12.050 --> 21:14.657
She's got this following
of leotards and sweat suits.

21:14.761 --> 21:17.368
She's fun to watch,
so lots of couples meet there.

21:17.472 --> 21:19.678
Sounds good. Maybe that will work.

21:19.974 --> 21:23.178
It's great. The only problem is
she doesn't want to cooperate.

21:23.353 --> 21:25.751
- But she will.
- I'm sure she will.

21:25.855 --> 21:29.639
Just remember, get close to her
while you research, but when you write...

21:29.943 --> 21:33.857
Forget she has a mother. Right.
Don't I always?

21:34.072 --> 21:36.195
- Talk to you later.
- <i>'Bye.</i>

21:38.952 --> 21:41.953
So, who's going to get
the Lawrence treatment this time?

21:42.413 --> 21:43.694
Some girl he met.

21:45.166 --> 21:48.167
- That's obvious.
- So what's the hook of your story?

21:48.586 --> 21:52.403
It's not one of those pieces about how
health clubs are the new singles bars?

21:52.507 --> 21:53.420
God forbid.

21:54.133 --> 21:57.716
- Do you work out?
- Yes, I do work out, when I have time.

21:58.221 --> 22:01.578
I don't take it as seriously
as you guys do, but I do work out.

22:01.683 --> 22:04.957
My dad didn't take it seriously, either.
He died fat at 40.

22:05.061 --> 22:05.761
Sorry.

22:06.813 --> 22:09.086
I was 8. I knew even then...

22:09.190 --> 22:12.381
if he had worked out and not smoked,
he'd have lived longer.

22:12.485 --> 22:13.564
How old are you?

22:14.904 --> 22:17.442
I'm sorry.
You don't have to answer that question.

22:19.993 --> 22:22.365
- Mid to late 20s.
- Interesting.

22:22.745 --> 22:23.600
What?

22:23.705 --> 22:26.145
Most people I've interviewed
are about that age.

22:26.249 --> 22:29.369
I think when you get to our age
you feel the need to keep in shape.

22:29.961 --> 22:32.693
Probably no coincidence
that the baby-boom generation...

22:32.797 --> 22:35.881
approached 30 at the same time
as the exercise boom started.

22:36.342 --> 22:38.252
- You do have a hook?
- Maybe.

22:38.845 --> 22:42.786
It's good to talk a story out before writing.
It's all spitballing at this point.

22:42.891 --> 22:44.538
- What's that?
- A tape recorder.

22:44.642 --> 22:47.374
I thought maybe we'd exchange ideas,
if you don't mind.

22:47.479 --> 22:48.677
- Do you mind?
- Yeah.

22:49.856 --> 22:51.628
- I won't do it.
- Thanks.

22:51.733 --> 22:54.298
I do have some notes
that may interest you.

22:54.402 --> 22:55.382
Look at this.

22:55.487 --> 22:58.385
"The baby-boomers are leading
a physical great awakening...

22:58.490 --> 23:02.736
"like the spiritual awakenings
that grip America about every 100 years."

23:04.287 --> 23:05.225
Pretty good.

23:05.330 --> 23:10.397
I think people want to take responsibility
instead of leaning on institutions.

23:10.502 --> 23:13.942
For instance, does anyone believe
the government will take care of us?

23:14.047 --> 23:17.498
- No.
- Not since Vietnam or Watergate, no.

23:17.967 --> 23:22.713
Or big corporations? Or even doctors?
So, you have to take care of yourself.

23:23.097 --> 23:26.264
A lot of people are trying to get in shape,
as you well know.

23:26.643 --> 23:28.332
I think we've come full circle.

23:28.436 --> 23:31.354
Almost back to Emersonian America
of self-reliance.

23:31.815 --> 23:33.392
There's something else here.

23:33.942 --> 23:37.800
Emerson: "Do that which is assigned thee
and thou canst not hope too much...

23:37.904 --> 23:39.315
"or dare too much."

23:40.156 --> 23:44.973
So, what could be more all-American,
more old-fashioned all-American...

23:45.078 --> 23:47.643
than institutions
like the Sports Connection?

23:47.747 --> 23:51.959
Little capitals of Emersonian America
scattered from sea to shining sea.

23:53.419 --> 23:54.618
You are so hot.

24:00.218 --> 24:02.408
I'm glad we had this off-the-record lunch.

24:02.512 --> 24:05.797
I was real suspicious of the kind of story
you were going to write.

24:06.015 --> 24:08.497
If you want to know
about the Sports Connection...

24:08.601 --> 24:10.624
a real writer would work out. Join.

24:10.728 --> 24:12.710
- You ever taken an aerobic class?
- No.

24:12.814 --> 24:15.379
I've got one starting soon.
You should take one of mine.

24:15.483 --> 24:19.675
I should, but I can't, I don't have the time.
I've another appointment this afternoon.

24:19.779 --> 24:23.887
I have to finish up a story
before I can concentrate on this one.

24:23.992 --> 24:26.613
- What's the other story?
- Joseph McKenzie.

24:27.412 --> 24:28.989
You do important stuff, too?

24:30.123 --> 24:32.813
- Will you be here later?
- Nope. I'm on the road.

24:32.917 --> 24:34.481
What do you mean, on the road?

24:34.586 --> 24:37.735
I teach class at the
Beverly Hills Sports Connection, tonight.

24:37.839 --> 24:40.321
- Coming in?
- No, I really don't have the time.

24:40.425 --> 24:42.216
I'll make a deal with you, though.

24:42.343 --> 24:47.301
I would gladly take one of your aerobic
classes if you'd let me interview you.

24:49.392 --> 24:51.515
I was really beginning to like you, too.

25:17.378 --> 25:18.484
Notes on lunch.

25:18.588 --> 25:22.029
We talked about baby-boom generation,
great physical awakening...

25:22.133 --> 25:23.758
Emersonian America.

25:24.302 --> 25:25.927
Father dies fat at 40.

25:26.221 --> 25:29.803
Interesting girl.
She's smart, but I've got to be smarter.

25:31.726 --> 25:33.600
McKenzie and I go way back.

25:34.103 --> 25:37.628
I met him when I was in New York,
and I was stripping, even then.

25:37.732 --> 25:40.057
Right, but in a little classier club.

25:40.652 --> 25:43.985
I didn't know who he was
and he walks into the club one night...

25:44.280 --> 25:46.512
and he puts a $1,000 bill in my G-string.

25:46.616 --> 25:49.237
- Are you kidding? Really?
- We had a lot of fun.

25:49.536 --> 25:51.659
- He's really a great guy.
- Sounds it.

25:52.956 --> 25:55.562
I'll tell you something,
if you promise not to tell.

25:55.667 --> 25:58.273
- Okay.
- He bought this house for me.

25:58.378 --> 25:59.733
- Really?
- Yes.

25:59.838 --> 26:03.420
- Well, do you still talk to him?
- Joe and I talk all the time.

26:04.175 --> 26:06.464
- Shotsy?
- My God, my husband's home.

26:06.928 --> 26:08.422
Eddie?

26:09.305 --> 26:11.078
- Honey, this is Adam Lawrence.
- Hi.

26:11.182 --> 26:14.790
He's a reporter for <i>Rolling Stone</i>,
and he's doing a piece on Joe McKenzie.

26:14.894 --> 26:18.377
- Get out of here.
- I wanted to ask your wife a few questions.

26:18.481 --> 26:20.963
- You leave her out of this.
- Eddie, I invited him.

26:21.067 --> 26:22.464
I told him he could come.

26:22.569 --> 26:26.218
He says that nobody has anything nice
to say about Joe, and I want to help.

26:26.322 --> 26:28.611
You're not saying anything to anybody.

26:29.659 --> 26:32.577
I don't want her name mentioned
in any article, understand?

26:34.831 --> 26:35.780
Now get out of here.

26:59.022 --> 26:59.887
<i>Knees up!</i>

27:10.492 --> 27:11.523
<i>Jumping jacks!</i>

28:04.337 --> 28:05.617
<i>See you next week.</i>

28:12.679 --> 28:15.619
- I'll see you guys later. I'm late.
- Great class. Thanks.

28:15.723 --> 28:16.589
'Bye.

28:17.225 --> 28:18.388
You did good.

28:19.936 --> 28:21.976
- See you later.
- Hi.

28:25.984 --> 28:28.799
- What are you doing here?
- I just thought I'd come by...

28:28.903 --> 28:31.525
and see if you needed someone
to help charge your battery.

28:35.118 --> 28:38.225
- I have a confession to make.
- A confession? Yeah?

28:38.329 --> 28:39.685
What kind of confession?

28:39.789 --> 28:43.272
On my way to work, I went to the library
and pulled some back issues...

28:43.376 --> 28:46.247
of <i>Rolling Stone</i> and read
some articles that you wrote.

28:47.964 --> 28:49.292
Really? Which ones?

28:50.425 --> 28:52.382
<i>Abscam</i> and <i>Junk Food.</i>

28:53.469 --> 28:56.174
"And?" he says, fishing for a compliment.

28:57.265 --> 28:58.973
You're pretty good.

29:00.602 --> 29:02.843
Must be fun being a reporter nowadays.

29:03.646 --> 29:06.137
"Yeah," he says suspiciously.

29:07.609 --> 29:10.100
You get to try to keep
the big boys honest.

29:10.236 --> 29:13.719
At the same time, you get to figure out
which way the culture's going.

29:13.823 --> 29:16.138
I guess that's true.
A friend of mine says...

29:16.242 --> 29:19.777
that popular culture is to society
what dreams are to an individual.

29:20.205 --> 29:24.416
If you want to find out about an individual,
you analyse their dreams.

29:25.001 --> 29:26.148
Same with society.

29:26.252 --> 29:30.416
If you want to find out about a society,
you analyse things like music and film.

29:31.216 --> 29:35.379
- Or health clubs, or junk food.
- And in doing so, you can be quite vicious.

29:38.306 --> 29:40.097
I think I try to be objective.

29:43.061 --> 29:44.888
Do you always work on a computer?

29:48.525 --> 29:50.648
Do you know anything about computers?

29:52.612 --> 29:54.301
I took a couple of courses.

29:54.405 --> 29:56.387
- You left it on.
- I always leave it on.

29:56.491 --> 30:00.358
This way, it's already warmed up
if I get an idea in the middle of the night.

30:01.746 --> 30:02.991
May I?

30:25.186 --> 30:26.709
Everybody writes that.

30:26.813 --> 30:29.545
I was hoping you'd come up
with something more original.

30:29.649 --> 30:31.108
How do you erase it?

30:49.419 --> 30:52.704
A good reporter would never get in bed
with a subject.

30:53.673 --> 30:55.333
You keep forgetting something.

30:56.551 --> 30:58.129
I'm not your subject.

31:11.774 --> 31:14.173
- You'd probably be a lousy interview.
- Probably.

31:14.277 --> 31:17.278
- No opinions, no ideas.
- None.

31:18.156 --> 31:21.722
- I think I'll take your class anyway.
- I give a very tough class.

31:21.826 --> 31:23.700
You do? Tell me about it.

31:24.537 --> 31:26.993
First, there's the warm-up.

31:28.416 --> 31:30.456
The warm-up is designed...

31:31.044 --> 31:34.994
to increase blood to the muscles,
to warm up the muscles.

31:35.632 --> 31:37.209
So as to be able...

31:37.926 --> 31:40.499
to do the more strenuous exercises.

31:41.221 --> 31:43.593
And then, there's the cardiovascular.

31:48.478 --> 31:50.138
Let me get rid of this.

31:51.940 --> 31:54.431
Hello. Yes. Who?

31:55.401 --> 31:57.026
Mr. McKenzie, yes.

31:57.946 --> 32:00.567
Well, this is he. Well, who told you?

32:01.407 --> 32:03.151
Shotsy did. Good.

32:04.452 --> 32:07.453
That's good, I think you should tell
your side of the story.

32:08.498 --> 32:11.748
Well, if I left right now,
I could probably catch the redeye.

32:12.544 --> 32:15.379
Great. Sounds good. Thank you.

32:17.340 --> 32:20.092
He'll meet with me. Maybe he'll talk.

32:21.219 --> 32:22.382
I got to go.

32:24.722 --> 32:26.098
Of course you do.

32:26.808 --> 32:28.219
Wait a minute.

32:29.185 --> 32:30.977
This is to be continued.

32:33.022 --> 32:34.398
I certainly hope so.

32:44.868 --> 32:46.598
- Hello?
- Hi, I called the office.

32:46.703 --> 32:48.350
They said you're still home.

32:48.454 --> 32:50.079
Rough night.

32:50.999 --> 32:53.689
Mikey Douglas was in town,
and I got the cocktail flu.

32:53.793 --> 32:56.118
- Where are you?
- I'm at JFK. Guess what?

32:56.337 --> 33:00.237
I got a meeting today with McKenzie.
We're to meet at 12:00 at the Atrium Club.

33:00.341 --> 33:01.697
- <i>You're shitting me.</i>
- No.

33:01.801 --> 33:04.533
- You got any space in the next issue?
- I'll make space.

33:04.637 --> 33:06.926
- <i>Has the cover closed yet?</i>
- Yeah, it's closed.

33:08.099 --> 33:09.178
Screw the cover.

33:09.517 --> 33:12.333
You're drunk, aren't you?
Must have been some turbulence.

33:12.437 --> 33:14.585
Listen, I can't talk. I got to go.

33:14.689 --> 33:18.473
I'll drop by later, how's that? 'Bye.
Wish me luck.

33:19.194 --> 33:20.688
Adam?

33:28.244 --> 33:29.620
Kent, it's Mark.

33:29.913 --> 33:33.604
Listen, I've waited all my life to say this:
Hold the presses.

33:33.708 --> 33:34.906
And get me Frankie.

33:45.595 --> 33:49.094
- What is she doing here? Frankie!
- Adam!

33:49.224 --> 33:52.206
- What are you doing?
- Mark wants me to photograph McKenzie.

33:52.310 --> 33:55.542
- No, he's nuts. I can't take you with me.
- Come on. You can try.

33:55.647 --> 33:57.770
- Forget about it.
- Adam, come on.

33:58.191 --> 33:59.838
Go, Frankie. I'm not kidding.

33:59.943 --> 34:02.466
Nobody's supposed to be here.
You'll blow it.

34:02.570 --> 34:06.679
- My photos are as important as your story.
- There'll be no story without an interview.

34:06.783 --> 34:08.443
- Don't do this to me.
- Bull!

34:09.034 --> 34:11.391
- What?
- It's Charlie, his flack.

34:11.496 --> 34:12.935
- Stay here.
- Charlie who?

34:13.039 --> 34:14.699
- Give me your camera.
- No.

34:15.083 --> 34:16.542
Charlie, hi.

34:16.835 --> 34:19.670
I'm so sorry I'm late.
The traffic was impossible.

34:24.509 --> 34:27.925
- Mind if I use my tape recorder?
- Why don't you ask him yourself?

34:33.976 --> 34:35.958
Well, you certainly come prepared.

34:36.062 --> 34:39.431
- Where to, Mr. McKenzie?
- Just drive around the park.

34:47.197 --> 34:49.523
- So, what happened?
- I got it.

34:49.659 --> 34:53.266
I never thought I'd get him to talk,
but once he started he wouldn't stop.

34:53.371 --> 34:56.145
It was amazing.
I have three solid hours all on tape.

34:56.248 --> 34:57.447
Adam!

34:58.126 --> 35:00.774
Where's my camera?
Give it to me right now.

35:00.879 --> 35:03.360
- Don't ever pull that again.
- The film's inside.

35:03.464 --> 35:05.237
- My first picture credit.
- What?

35:05.341 --> 35:08.793
- Have it developed. See you later, Frankie.
- Screw you.

35:12.182 --> 35:13.676
- So what's the story?
- Okay.

35:14.559 --> 35:18.000
McKenzie was negotiating
to sell his computers to Czechoslovakia...

35:18.104 --> 35:19.515
to save his company.

35:19.772 --> 35:22.546
He had it all worked out.
He was gonna move computers...

35:22.650 --> 35:25.299
through dummy corporations,
all over Europe...

35:25.403 --> 35:27.728
until they wound up
behind the Iron Curtain.

35:27.906 --> 35:30.721
He claims the government found out
what he was up to...

35:30.825 --> 35:33.098
and put him out of business
by busting him.

35:33.203 --> 35:35.741
- How much space do you need?
- Six pages.

35:37.248 --> 35:37.912
Four.

35:38.917 --> 35:39.782
Five.

35:40.293 --> 35:43.942
Okay, four and a half.
We'll hold the issue. When can I have it?

35:44.047 --> 35:46.289
- How soon do you need it?
- Tomorrow morning.

35:46.925 --> 35:47.873
You got it.

35:50.428 --> 35:52.618
What about this aerobics contest
coming up?

35:52.722 --> 35:54.762
They want me to make a demonstration.

35:54.891 --> 35:57.331
- Jessie, phone for you.
- Okay.

35:57.435 --> 35:59.677
- Okay, killer, I'll see you later.
- Be good.

35:59.979 --> 36:02.002
- How you doing? You through?
- Yeah.

36:02.106 --> 36:03.587
- Where were you?
- Hiding.

36:03.691 --> 36:04.854
Here you go.

36:05.902 --> 36:07.147
Hello.

36:08.613 --> 36:10.570
Adam, hi.

36:10.949 --> 36:12.775
I'm fine. How was the interview?

36:13.284 --> 36:14.932
It was real interesting.

36:15.036 --> 36:19.164
I really can't tell you the details right now.
I'm afraid this phone is being tapped.

36:19.499 --> 36:22.619
I'll be in tomorrow.
I'll call you when I know what time.

36:23.711 --> 36:24.909
I'll be there.

36:33.972 --> 36:35.964
<i>Make sure my tape recorder is on.</i>

36:37.141 --> 36:41.768
<i>I understand you suspect the government
of what lawyers politely call "misconduct."</i>

36:42.188 --> 36:43.184
<i>That's right.</i>

36:44.482 --> 36:46.771
<i>Well, could you expand on that?</i>

36:47.777 --> 36:49.633
<i>I have reason to believe...</i>

36:49.737 --> 36:53.486
<i>that they eavesdropped
on my office computers.</i>

36:53.700 --> 36:55.776
<i>You know, like hackers. But...</i>

36:55.994 --> 36:58.698
<i>these hackers weren't kids.
They were FBI hackers.</i>

37:32.405 --> 37:33.983
Yes, hello.

37:37.660 --> 37:38.858
What cuts?

37:39.871 --> 37:41.365
What trouble?

37:43.124 --> 37:44.038
Right.

37:44.626 --> 37:46.499
I'll be there. Okay.

37:57.555 --> 37:58.634
Frankie.

37:59.390 --> 38:03.851
- How did my pictures turn out?
- Bad, amateurish, snapshotty.

38:04.395 --> 38:05.510
That good?

38:07.732 --> 38:11.018
- Mark can see you. The lawyers are here.
- The lawyers?

38:16.533 --> 38:18.490
Come on in.
You know Tod Turner and Martha Young?

38:19.160 --> 38:20.489
Only on the phone.

38:21.162 --> 38:23.477
You really are expecting this
to cause trouble.

38:23.581 --> 38:25.896
- I thought you liked causing trouble.
- I do...

38:26.000 --> 38:28.456
more than anybody you know,
but up to a point.

38:28.628 --> 38:30.067
Let me guess what that is.

38:30.171 --> 38:33.028
Could that be the point
where trouble costs you money?

38:33.132 --> 38:35.531
Right. You want to split the bills
on this one?

38:35.635 --> 38:38.117
- What's the problem?
- Martha, why don't you start?

38:38.221 --> 38:40.869
Mark says that you have
the entire interview on tape.

38:40.974 --> 38:42.765
Something like three hours?

38:43.101 --> 38:45.582
- Who's to retain custody of the tapes?
- I am, why?

38:45.687 --> 38:49.387
The magazine should retain
the original tape, or a copy for its files.

38:49.816 --> 38:53.048
- That's not a problem, is it?
- That is a problem.

38:53.153 --> 38:55.801
I promised McKenzie
I wouldn't let anyone have a copy.

38:55.905 --> 38:58.762
The prosecutors will demand a copy
once this story is out.

38:58.867 --> 39:01.951
I promised him they would never get it.
I gave him my word.

39:02.412 --> 39:05.269
We'll do everything to keep the tapes
from the government.

39:05.373 --> 39:08.981
- We'll fight any subpoena in court.
- That's not good enough.

39:09.085 --> 39:13.165
I will make sure the tapes don't get out.
The only way to do that is to keep them.

39:14.507 --> 39:18.505
What happens if the magazine were fined
$1,000 a day until you turned them over?

39:19.679 --> 39:22.369
I won't test the magazine's guts
or its bank account.

39:22.473 --> 39:25.391
The government could pressure you, too,
send you to jail.

39:25.602 --> 39:29.053
That's a risk I have to take.
Where are the cuts? I want to see them.

39:29.981 --> 39:31.211
Adam, be reasonable.

39:31.316 --> 39:34.381
You could have libelled McKenzie.
He could have libelled others.

39:34.486 --> 39:37.819
Let's not kid around.
Mark could be facing millions in lawsuits.

39:38.907 --> 39:41.943
Without your tapes we have no evidence
to go into court with.

39:43.077 --> 39:46.696
I can't recommend that Mark publish
the article unless you turn them over.

39:46.998 --> 39:50.314
I can't recommend these cuts.
Someone's editing with their elbows.

39:50.418 --> 39:52.024
- Where are the tapes?
- In my bag.

39:52.128 --> 39:55.235
Look, you wanted me to do the story,
I did the story. Okay?

39:55.340 --> 39:58.091
Take it or leave it.
Print it, don't print it.

39:58.426 --> 40:01.297
I got a plane to catch.
Another story to write.

40:06.434 --> 40:08.178
You have a big decision to make.

40:23.076 --> 40:24.903
Now, where were we?

40:34.838 --> 40:36.960
What comes after the warm-up?

40:37.340 --> 40:38.715
After the warm-up...

40:39.467 --> 40:41.958
is the cardiovascular section.

40:42.512 --> 40:44.801
It should last for 15 to 20 minutes.

40:45.265 --> 40:48.384
It should be un-interrupted and steady.

40:49.477 --> 40:54.169
This aerobic phase exercises
the most important muscle in the body.

40:54.274 --> 40:56.017
- Which is?
- The heart.

45:25.461 --> 45:27.234
- How do you feel?
- I feel great.

45:27.338 --> 45:29.960
- You're gonna be sore tomorrow.
- I don't think so.

45:30.466 --> 45:33.467
- Still want to interview me?
- I don't know.

45:33.761 --> 45:36.452
- I broke the cardinal rule of journalism.
- What's that?

45:36.556 --> 45:39.830
After what we did last night,
I don't think I can be objective.

45:39.934 --> 45:42.666
- I need to take a shower.
- I need to make a phone call.

45:42.770 --> 45:45.096
- You want to come out to my house later?
- Yeah.

45:45.648 --> 45:47.308
- You did good today.
- Thanks.

45:47.609 --> 45:48.937
For a New Yorker.

45:49.861 --> 45:52.269
- For a New Yorker, too.
- Nice legs.

45:55.116 --> 45:57.738
- Mark, it's Adam!
- I'll take it up here.

46:01.706 --> 46:04.279
- Tell him I have to talk to him.
- Hello.

46:04.584 --> 46:08.451
Mark? Hi. Just checking up.
The McKenzie story going or what?

46:08.713 --> 46:10.444
- We're closing it tonight.
- <i>Good.</i>

46:10.548 --> 46:13.197
- Where are you?
- I'm at the infamous Sports Erection.

46:13.301 --> 46:15.991
- <i>How's that going?</i>
- It's tougher than I thought.

46:16.095 --> 46:19.078
I need some more time.
I haven't really started writing yet.

46:19.182 --> 46:21.205
What about that Aerobics Pied Piper?

46:21.309 --> 46:22.373
- Hi, Adam.
- Hi.

46:22.477 --> 46:23.675
I'm working on her.

46:24.646 --> 46:27.961
Do me a favour and send an advance copy
of that McKenzie story...

46:28.066 --> 46:32.395
to Simon & Schuster? Dick Schneider.
Tell him why it's not on the cover, okay?

46:32.737 --> 46:36.136
Speaking of covers, I got this great idea
for the health issue cover.

46:36.241 --> 46:36.970
Ready?

46:37.075 --> 46:39.807
You wanted to use Christie Brinkley,
now you can.

46:39.911 --> 46:41.350
- In a leotard.
- <i>Not bad.</i>

46:41.454 --> 46:44.228
- <i>Dita needs to talk to you.</i>
- No, I don't want to.

46:44.332 --> 46:47.037
I don't have my notes.
I'll just call her later, okay?

46:47.293 --> 46:48.788
All right, I'm going. 'Bye.

46:49.879 --> 46:51.276
- Kenny?
- Hey, what's up?

46:51.381 --> 46:54.363
Could you tell me something?
This girl, what's her name?

46:54.467 --> 46:56.294
- Which one?
- The one with Robert.

46:56.761 --> 46:58.090
That's Linda Slater.

46:59.264 --> 47:01.495
- She's dying to get in your article.
- Really?

47:01.599 --> 47:04.164
- Yeah, but you don't want to talk to her.
- Why not?

47:04.269 --> 47:06.760
She's the most used piece of equipment
in the gym.

47:08.690 --> 47:11.130
I don't know.
I don't think you can be objective.

47:11.234 --> 47:13.716
I mean, really objective,
under any circumstances.

47:13.820 --> 47:16.343
- Like the Heisenberg principle of physics.
- Yes.

47:16.447 --> 47:19.221
The theory that we change things
by observing them.

47:19.325 --> 47:22.641
The idea is that to see something
you have to shed some light on it.

47:22.745 --> 47:26.577
- And light alters what it shines on.
- Yeah, that's good. Very good point.

47:28.710 --> 47:30.607
- Hi, you guys.
- Hi, hon.

47:30.712 --> 47:34.069
Jeff, Bobby, this is Adam Lawrence.
Adam, Jeff, Bobby.

47:34.174 --> 47:36.405
How you doing?
Your mother's in the kitchen.

47:36.509 --> 47:39.033
- Is she sober?
- She brought the divinity again.

47:39.137 --> 47:41.827
- Not a good sign.
- We're going skiing this weekend.

47:41.931 --> 47:44.580
- Why don't you guys come?
- Skiing? This time of year?

47:44.684 --> 47:47.353
They ski Mammoth until July 4.
Why, you ski?

47:47.979 --> 47:49.793
Sometimes, yeah. I like to ski.

47:49.898 --> 47:52.755
- Why don't you guys come with us?
- Maybe we will.

47:52.859 --> 47:57.022
We'll see how he feels. You see,
he just took his first aerobics class. Mine.

47:58.281 --> 47:59.360
Nothing to it.

48:00.450 --> 48:02.608
- This place is great.
- Yeah, we like it.

48:02.785 --> 48:06.060
Jeff and I are just roommates.
He teaches at the Sports Connection.

48:06.164 --> 48:08.979
That's where he met the girls.
You should interview them.

48:09.083 --> 48:12.535
They have this interesting relationship.
Mom!

48:15.298 --> 48:17.571
I'm not staying, I'm leaving. Don't worry.

48:17.675 --> 48:21.803
I was lunching at The Muse and I wanted
to drop by some divinity I made last night.

48:22.680 --> 48:24.554
- Hi, Jess.
- Hi, Billy.

48:25.266 --> 48:27.289
As I said, they have an odd relationship.

48:27.393 --> 48:28.415
Yeah.

48:28.520 --> 48:31.919
- This is the best divinity I've ever made.
- Mom, Adam Lawrence.

48:32.023 --> 48:33.587
- Adam, my mom, Melody.
- How do you do?

48:33.691 --> 48:37.341
Adam works for <i>Rolling Stone.</i>
He's doing an article on Sports Connection.

48:37.445 --> 48:39.885
- He looks too nice to be a reporter.
- Mother.

48:39.989 --> 48:41.887
A piece of divinity, Mr. Lawrence?

48:41.991 --> 48:43.764
She makes the best divinity in the world.

48:43.868 --> 48:46.558
You're thinking of interviewing Jessie
for this story?

48:46.663 --> 48:49.201
We're talking about it.
We haven't quite decided.

48:49.374 --> 48:52.231
Well, I hope you treat her better
than the last reporter.

48:52.335 --> 48:54.791
That was one of the worst experiences
of my life.

48:55.004 --> 48:57.528
I thought we weren't going
to talk about it.

48:57.632 --> 48:59.459
All right, I'm going.

49:00.218 --> 49:04.201
Goodbye, darling. Come visit.
'Bye, Mr. Lawrence. Enjoy the divinity.

49:04.305 --> 49:06.761
Jessica, you're too skinny.

49:08.810 --> 49:11.500
- This stuff will kill you.
- What was she talking about?

49:11.604 --> 49:14.356
Who is this reporter
and why was he interviewing you?

49:15.275 --> 49:17.715
If I told you,
you might be tempted to use it.

49:17.819 --> 49:19.147
I couldn't stand that.

49:21.156 --> 49:24.406
Wait a minute, I want to know
what she was talking about.

49:24.784 --> 49:28.058
In high school, I was a swimmer.
I was a very good swimmer.

49:28.163 --> 49:30.488
I broke world records.
I made the Olympic team.

49:30.832 --> 49:33.952
That was the year Carter decided
to boycott the games in Moscow.

49:34.669 --> 49:36.984
I didn't agree with him
and was vocal about it.

49:37.088 --> 49:40.504
There was this reporter who said
he wanted to write about how I felt.

49:40.675 --> 49:44.340
But what he ended up writing about,
after a series of interviews...

49:44.721 --> 49:47.212
was my alleged love affair with my coach.

49:50.018 --> 49:53.387
- I'll show you where the phone is.
- Wait a minute.

49:54.689 --> 49:56.563
- Where's the phone?
- On the roof.

49:56.774 --> 49:59.214
- Jessie, hold on.
- I don't want to talk about it.

49:59.319 --> 50:00.924
- Jessie.
- I don't want to!

50:01.029 --> 50:04.279
- Just tell me about the L.A. games.
- I was never that fast again.

50:05.116 --> 50:07.275
Here's the phone. Make your call.

50:08.119 --> 50:09.911
I'm going to go check on the mail.

50:18.630 --> 50:19.401
Hello.

50:19.506 --> 50:22.506
Dita. What's up? You need me?

50:22.842 --> 50:24.657
I'm having trouble checking this.

50:24.761 --> 50:28.035
Everyone's afraid, nobody will talk to me.
I really need your help.

50:28.139 --> 50:29.514
- You ready?
- <i>Shoot.</i>

50:30.225 --> 50:34.083
- Are you sure about the spelling of Shotsy?
- S-H-O-T-S-Y.

50:34.187 --> 50:36.393
- How did you like the piece?
- Not bad.

50:36.648 --> 50:40.776
We should do more of this sort of thing.
Man does not live by rock 'n' roll alone.

50:41.152 --> 50:42.148
Woman either.

50:42.362 --> 50:44.983
I got to put you on hold.
Somebody's buzzing me.

50:45.406 --> 50:46.901
- Okay.
- Adam!

50:49.285 --> 50:52.267
Believe it or not,
I've changed my mind about something.

50:52.372 --> 50:54.660
Let's go skiing. I want to go to Mammoth.

50:55.458 --> 50:57.250
You can interview me all you want.

51:28.158 --> 51:29.320
What's the matter?

51:30.827 --> 51:32.238
I can't move.

51:33.621 --> 51:35.780
God, I can't move.

51:36.875 --> 51:38.250
I got polio.

51:38.877 --> 51:41.712
I got polio! God!

51:44.924 --> 51:49.752
- How many articles do you write in a year?
- I don't know. Ten, sometimes more.

51:50.263 --> 51:52.421
Do you always follow your subjects around?

51:52.849 --> 51:55.933
You're interviewing me.
I'm supposed to be interviewing you.

51:58.229 --> 52:01.100
- Any pointers on how to improve my style?
- Yes.

52:01.566 --> 52:04.235
Always treat a famous person
as if they're not.

52:04.652 --> 52:06.941
And a person who's not famous
as if they were.

52:07.322 --> 52:09.564
And think of your interview
as a seduction.

52:10.074 --> 52:11.901
- A seduction?
- Yes.

52:12.535 --> 52:14.943
How many times a year
do you fall in love, Adam?

52:15.413 --> 52:16.872
It depends on the subject.

52:17.832 --> 52:20.039
I think anything worthwhile takes longer.

52:20.376 --> 52:22.120
Working out, a relationship.

52:22.795 --> 52:26.046
Maybe you're right. I wrote
six articles a day for a newspaper.

52:26.257 --> 52:29.342
- At least I'm going in the right direction.
- Which is?

52:30.553 --> 52:32.546
Take some time off, write a book.

52:33.765 --> 52:34.714
About what?

52:35.433 --> 52:39.098
McKenzie, maybe. If this article
is as good as I think it will be.

52:39.354 --> 52:42.520
Maybe even the press.
They have gotten a lot of bum raps lately.

52:42.816 --> 52:44.974
Yeah. And you? What would you like to do?

52:45.777 --> 52:48.647
Right now? Or for the rest of my life?

52:49.197 --> 52:51.652
You don't want to teach aerobics forever,
do you?

52:53.701 --> 52:57.059
No, there's a point
when you're not the best, so you get out.

52:57.163 --> 52:59.286
Is it important for you to be the best?

53:00.458 --> 53:03.293
Yeah. Ever since I was a kid.

53:04.838 --> 53:08.669
I'm trying to find something that means
the same as going for the gold medal.

53:10.301 --> 53:11.926
I always expected to win it.

53:13.721 --> 53:17.090
I like breaking records.
I like setting records and breaking them.

53:17.517 --> 53:19.094
I like winning trophies.

53:20.228 --> 53:21.556
I like being the best.

53:22.313 --> 53:23.642
You are the best.

53:25.900 --> 53:27.857
You want to go break another record?

53:28.403 --> 53:30.645
- Sure you're not too sore?
- Yes.

53:31.406 --> 53:32.485
Let's go.

53:43.751 --> 53:45.791
- Good luck, right?
- Yeah, right.

53:47.755 --> 53:48.918
Come on.

53:51.176 --> 53:54.093
- I've just the remedy for you.
- You do?

53:57.140 --> 53:59.330
I really got turned on in that class.

53:59.434 --> 54:02.041
It's sexy to watch people work out,
don't you think?

54:02.145 --> 54:04.636
Sure, because the sexuality is so free.

54:04.939 --> 54:08.355
- Everything seems to be so legal.
- It's definitely a meat market.

54:08.651 --> 54:12.092
Which is probably why you don't see
many couples working out together.

54:12.197 --> 54:15.888
I mean, if they pair off they fall out
and you never see them again.

54:15.992 --> 54:18.974
- They never come back.
- It's 'cause it makes sex much better.

54:19.078 --> 54:22.561
The better your body looks,
the more you want to take off your clothes.

54:22.665 --> 54:24.076
It's true.

54:24.792 --> 54:26.452
That's good.

54:27.170 --> 54:30.753
Well, do you think that people
that are in better shape have better sex?

54:31.174 --> 54:32.196
Yeah.

54:32.300 --> 54:33.960
- Definitely.
- Without a doubt.

54:34.802 --> 54:36.879
All right, how can we expand on that?

54:37.639 --> 54:38.504
I did.

54:38.765 --> 54:41.600
- I mean, two heads are better than one.
- Jeffrey.

54:42.519 --> 54:43.799
Yeah?

54:44.103 --> 54:46.429
- Hi, Jess.
- Better than one, huh?

55:07.752 --> 55:10.243
"What are you thinking about?"
he says, hopefully.

55:11.381 --> 55:14.321
I'm thinking about George Hathaway,
to tell you the truth.

55:14.425 --> 55:15.706
Who's that?

55:16.386 --> 55:20.004
He's the reporter who wrote that piece
in <i>Inside Sports</i> magazine.

55:20.557 --> 55:22.430
What made you think of him?

55:24.519 --> 55:26.844
I think about the press a lot nowadays.

55:28.690 --> 55:30.232
Anything specific?

55:32.569 --> 55:36.103
I was wondering if he has any idea
what his article did to all of us?

55:38.158 --> 55:39.865
What do you mean, exactly?

55:42.287 --> 55:44.991
It's very hard for me
to trust anybody, anymore.

55:46.124 --> 55:47.618
On any level.

55:50.545 --> 55:52.651
My mom and I didn't talk for a year.

55:52.755 --> 55:55.709
See, she was the one who gave him
most of his information.

55:56.050 --> 55:58.838
Although, she says she didn't say
what he printed.

56:00.471 --> 56:02.963
It didn't matter
because my coach lost his job.

56:04.684 --> 56:06.593
His wife left him, took their kids.

56:07.187 --> 56:11.462
And he and I...
I don't know, it was just never the same.

56:11.566 --> 56:13.559
We went to one meet afterwards.

56:15.111 --> 56:16.736
It was just too painful.

56:17.947 --> 56:19.821
It was actually humiliating.

56:21.075 --> 56:24.694
But was it true?
Did you have an affair with your coach?

56:33.963 --> 56:35.339
What's that, Adam?

56:37.926 --> 56:39.124
A tape recorder.

56:40.178 --> 56:42.087
- Is it on?
- Yes.

56:47.644 --> 56:48.509
Get out!

56:48.853 --> 56:51.752
- Get the fuck out of my car, Adam!
- Jesus Christ.

56:51.856 --> 56:53.765
- You fucking liar!
- Jessie.

56:53.900 --> 56:55.939
You're a sphincter muscle, Adam!

57:48.580 --> 57:51.534
She's mad.
She always swims when she's mad.

58:29.204 --> 58:30.152
Hi.

58:30.497 --> 58:32.978
- Hi, Mr. Lawrence.
- What's going on out there?

58:33.082 --> 58:37.191
The kids think Boy George is staying here,
and I'm trying to convince them he's not.

58:37.295 --> 58:40.444
Your editor called and said it's urgent
that you get back to him.

58:40.548 --> 58:41.959
- Really? Thanks.
- Yeah.

58:43.676 --> 58:46.547
We want Boy! We want Boy!

59:06.658 --> 59:09.575
- Hello?
- Adam, it's Mark. Hold on.

59:10.662 --> 59:12.619
Where were you these last three days?

59:12.997 --> 59:16.397
Skiing, Mark. I've been skiing
the beautiful High Sierras.

59:16.501 --> 59:17.247
Skiing.

59:17.544 --> 59:21.276
- What's that got to do with the story?
- Very little, I suspect. What's up?

59:21.381 --> 59:23.836
The whole world wants to get
that McKenzie piece.

59:24.008 --> 59:26.365
- Like who?
- New York Times <i>,</i> Washington Post...

59:26.469 --> 59:28.951
Wall Street Journal <i>,</i> Time <i>,</i>
Newsweek <i>, the wires.</i>

59:29.055 --> 59:31.704
<i>As you weren't in, all I could say was,
"Eat shit and die."</i>

59:31.808 --> 59:34.790
- You're a real phrasemaker.
- And McKenzie's lawyers called.

59:34.894 --> 59:37.960
They want the story bad.
They offered me money not to run it.

59:38.064 --> 59:39.143
Did you take it?

59:40.525 --> 59:42.731
Adam, eat shit and die.

59:47.574 --> 59:49.234
We want Boy!

59:52.370 --> 59:54.727
- Yes, Mark?
- Then some guy calls and says...

59:54.831 --> 59:58.116
no health club will keep you healthy
if McKenzie's story runs.

59:58.418 --> 01:00:02.234
Sounds like I'm being followed.
God, wait a minute.

01:00:02.338 --> 01:00:04.130
I think my room has been searched.

01:00:04.549 --> 01:00:07.384
- What? Where are the tapes?
- In my bag.

01:00:07.635 --> 01:00:09.074
Maybe you better get home.

01:00:09.179 --> 01:00:11.201
I don't have anyone to hang a story on.

01:00:11.306 --> 01:00:14.425
What happened to Miss Pied Piper
in leotards? She was perfect.

01:00:14.601 --> 01:00:17.416
- She's not. There's no story there.
- You sure?

01:00:17.520 --> 01:00:20.794
I said there's no fucking story there,
but I'll find one, okay?

01:00:20.899 --> 01:00:23.686
Hold on. What's the matter with you, Adam?

01:00:24.027 --> 01:00:28.135
Hey, do you think I like it out here?
I can't stand it here. I hate California.

01:00:28.239 --> 01:00:30.113
Nothing ever goes right for me here.

01:00:31.868 --> 01:00:33.243
<i>Cherchez la femme.</i>

01:00:33.870 --> 01:00:36.518
Sounds like you're in love
with a California airhead.

01:00:36.623 --> 01:00:38.781
Eat shit and die, will you?

01:01:06.569 --> 01:01:10.187
Hello? No, this is Sally. Who's this?

01:01:12.242 --> 01:01:13.639
Yeah, just a minute.

01:01:13.743 --> 01:01:17.029
Linda, it's for you.
It's that guy from <i>Rolling Stone.</i>

01:01:18.331 --> 01:01:19.113
You're kidding.

01:01:23.628 --> 01:01:27.079
- <i>What do you want him to do?</i>
- Take it off!

01:02:09.924 --> 01:02:13.542
Isn't he wonderful?
Sally is so proud of him.

01:02:14.971 --> 01:02:18.162
- How long has he been doing this?
- Ever since she met him.

01:02:18.266 --> 01:02:22.333
- They met at the Sports Connection, right?
- Right. The first day we joined.

01:02:22.437 --> 01:02:24.626
- She's so lucky.
- Yeah.

01:02:24.731 --> 01:02:27.138
She had no idea he was a male stripper.

01:02:38.912 --> 01:02:40.785
That's my lover who's out there.

01:02:53.343 --> 01:02:55.783
<i>Ladies in the back,
move down to the front steps!</i>

01:02:55.887 --> 01:02:59.587
<i>Move to the front
with your tips for Roger!</i>

01:03:09.859 --> 01:03:11.882
- Can you see all right?
- What?

01:03:11.986 --> 01:03:15.135
Can you see all right?
I'm sorry you have to watch from there...

01:03:15.240 --> 01:03:18.430
but Roger had to do some fast talking
to get you in at all.

01:03:18.535 --> 01:03:20.112
It's fine. I can see.

01:03:54.237 --> 01:03:56.064
Now, watch this.

01:04:13.840 --> 01:04:16.710
- Nobody knows they go together.
- That's great.

01:04:29.772 --> 01:04:31.337
- Hi, Linda.
- Hi, Matt.

01:04:31.441 --> 01:04:32.713
- How you doing?
- Good.

01:04:32.817 --> 01:04:34.173
- How are you?
- Great.

01:04:34.277 --> 01:04:36.759
- Can I get you another drink?
- Sure, yeah.

01:04:36.863 --> 01:04:38.927
- Adam, you want a drink?
- No, thank you.

01:04:39.032 --> 01:04:40.230
I'll be right back.

01:04:40.575 --> 01:04:43.640
- God, you know everybody.
- He works out at the gym, too.

01:04:43.745 --> 01:04:47.695
I know everybody at the gym.
It's like my home away from home.

01:04:48.750 --> 01:04:49.855
He's real nice.

01:04:49.959 --> 01:04:53.400
- He's been on <i>Merv Griffin.</i>
- You know, it doesn't surprise me.

01:04:53.505 --> 01:04:55.778
- What?
- I say, it doesn't surprise me...

01:04:55.882 --> 01:05:00.591
that you know all the handsome men.
I bet a pretty girl like you gets hit on a lot.

01:05:02.722 --> 01:05:04.964
Yeah, I do okay.

01:05:06.601 --> 01:05:07.799
Excuse me...

01:05:08.895 --> 01:05:11.351
I'll be right back.
I have to talk to Sally.

01:05:14.400 --> 01:05:16.974
Sally. Sally, come here.

01:05:17.821 --> 01:05:20.177
- It's going great, isn't it?
- Fantastic.

01:05:20.281 --> 01:05:23.485
Listen, he is so charming.
I want to invite him to the party.

01:05:23.910 --> 01:05:24.657
What?

01:05:25.411 --> 01:05:27.685
Adam. He's so charming.

01:05:27.789 --> 01:05:30.743
- I want to invite him to the party.
- Great.

01:05:31.960 --> 01:05:34.248
I think he's trying to seduce me.

01:05:53.690 --> 01:05:56.145
Hey, Sally, happy birthday.

01:05:56.401 --> 01:05:59.633
No, Robert, not yet.
Not until the stroke of midnight.

01:05:59.737 --> 01:06:02.886
- Sally, where's Linda?
- She's around here someplace.

01:06:02.991 --> 01:06:06.098
She's with that <i>Rolling Stone</i> reporter.
Don't tell anybody...

01:06:06.202 --> 01:06:09.239
but he's going to make us
the focus of the article, maybe.

01:06:09.414 --> 01:06:11.157
So act natural, okay?

01:06:12.250 --> 01:06:15.251
And this is Sally's bedroom over here.

01:06:15.712 --> 01:06:17.943
- And this is my bedroom.
- Nice.

01:06:18.047 --> 01:06:22.425
Just don't call me a male stripper.
I'm an exotic dancer. And don't forget it.

01:06:23.011 --> 01:06:25.492
Are you sure you don't want
to take off your coat?

01:06:25.597 --> 01:06:27.036
- It's hot.
- Not really.

01:06:27.140 --> 01:06:29.413
Do you mind if I use a tape recorder
or take notes?

01:06:29.517 --> 01:06:32.791
Not at all. You got to get it right.
I don't want to be misquoted.

01:06:32.896 --> 01:06:34.271
Next question?

01:06:37.525 --> 01:06:40.692
- Hi, guys.
- Hi, Linda.

01:06:40.945 --> 01:06:41.977
Hey, Linda.

01:06:42.530 --> 01:06:44.322
Come over here and sit on my face.

01:06:45.200 --> 01:06:47.431
Shut up. I'm being interviewed.

01:06:47.535 --> 01:06:49.767
Tell him about the bachelor party.

01:06:49.871 --> 01:06:52.686
- I was drunk.
- And the night in the back of a Mustang.

01:06:52.790 --> 01:06:55.731
What night? I don't remember you there.
Were you there?

01:06:55.835 --> 01:06:59.453
That was really good.
Remember that? That was great.

01:07:01.090 --> 01:07:04.239
I hope everyone likes vegetarian food,
because I'm a fanatic.

01:07:04.344 --> 01:07:06.575
I wanted everything to be healthy tonight.

01:07:06.679 --> 01:07:09.384
Except the birthday cake.
I made that with white sugar.

01:07:09.516 --> 01:07:11.538
You can't have a healthy birthday cake.

01:07:11.643 --> 01:07:15.475
Did you girls ever frequent singles bars?
Did you do that scene?

01:07:16.564 --> 01:07:17.679
Did we ever.

01:07:18.233 --> 01:07:20.547
For a while I think that's all we did.

01:07:20.652 --> 01:07:23.509
Yeah, we had our own bar stools
with notches on them...

01:07:23.613 --> 01:07:25.636
in every singles bar in the Marina.

01:07:25.740 --> 01:07:28.847
Linda, stop talking like a sleaze.
We weren't that bad.

01:07:28.952 --> 01:07:31.850
Why did you decide to join a health club?
Any one thing?

01:07:31.955 --> 01:07:34.728
I got sick of drinks
with parasols in them.

01:07:34.833 --> 01:07:38.065
No, I just got so tired of waking up
feeling crummy every day.

01:07:38.169 --> 01:07:40.567
I kept meeting one jerk after another.

01:07:40.672 --> 01:07:42.528
I wanted to meet a healthy man.

01:07:42.632 --> 01:07:46.907
Linda, you'll give the wrong impression.
Not everyone joins to meet someone.

01:07:47.011 --> 01:07:50.452
- Most people join just to work out.
- Now, speak for yourself.

01:07:50.557 --> 01:07:54.081
A psychic told Sally she'd meet
the man of her dreams at a health club.

01:07:54.185 --> 01:07:57.001
Right, so that's when we joined
the Sports Connection.

01:07:57.105 --> 01:07:59.975
- And you met Roger the very first day.
- Yeah.

01:08:00.567 --> 01:08:02.047
It was love at first sight.

01:08:02.152 --> 01:08:05.022
I took one look at those tits
and my whole body got hard.

01:08:06.281 --> 01:08:09.179
You're terrible. He's writing that down.

01:08:09.284 --> 01:08:11.974
Come on, Sally,
you're just as proud of them as I am.

01:08:12.078 --> 01:08:13.453
Actually, I am.

01:08:13.621 --> 01:08:16.270
As a little girl,
I would go to Ann-Margret movies.

01:08:16.374 --> 01:08:18.104
I'd come home praying for tits.

01:08:18.209 --> 01:08:22.158
Now, I prayed for tits, too, you know.
God just didn't answer my prayers.

01:08:22.421 --> 01:08:26.040
Yes, He did. God answers all prayers.
He just said no.

01:08:31.221 --> 01:08:34.455
Do you see similarities
between singles bars and health clubs?

01:08:34.559 --> 01:08:37.332
Yeah, but I love health clubs
a lot better.

01:08:37.437 --> 01:08:41.795
Singles bars are really humiliating.
You're waiting there to meet somebody.

01:08:41.899 --> 01:08:45.049
- You have an excuse to be at a health club.
- Right.

01:08:45.153 --> 01:08:47.593
And it's a lot safer
looking for Mr. Goodbody...

01:08:47.697 --> 01:08:49.428
than looking for Mr. Goodbar.

01:08:49.532 --> 01:08:51.180
That's good. I'll use that.

01:08:51.283 --> 01:08:53.241
- Really? You like that?
- Yeah.

01:08:53.368 --> 01:08:56.157
This is so much fun.
I feel like I'm on <i>Johnny Carson.</i>

01:08:56.915 --> 01:08:59.453
- I really like that cleft in your chin.
- Thanks.

01:09:01.294 --> 01:09:05.078
"Happy birthday to you

01:09:05.631 --> 01:09:08.751
"Happy birthday to you

01:09:09.344 --> 01:09:13.118
"Happy birthday, dear Sally"

01:09:13.223 --> 01:09:13.911
God!

01:09:14.015 --> 01:09:17.764
"Happy birthday to you

01:09:18.060 --> 01:09:21.394
"And many more"

01:09:24.149 --> 01:09:25.894
Make a wish!

01:09:26.778 --> 01:09:27.975
Okay.

01:09:30.490 --> 01:09:31.770
Blow. Blow.

01:09:32.533 --> 01:09:34.277
Somebody get the lights on.

01:09:35.245 --> 01:09:37.451
Here, open this one first.

01:09:37.705 --> 01:09:41.406
- Roger, not yet. She's got to cut the cake.
- Just this one.

01:09:44.337 --> 01:09:45.712
What is it?

01:09:46.339 --> 01:09:49.174
Linda, it's an engagement ring!
Do you believe it?

01:09:51.970 --> 01:09:53.428
Congratulations.

01:09:54.305 --> 01:09:56.132
I love you so much.

01:09:58.309 --> 01:09:59.852
Look, you guys.

01:10:04.399 --> 01:10:06.023
I'll go make coffee.

01:10:07.235 --> 01:10:10.604
I'm dying. Wait, Linda,
I'm going to cut the cake!

01:10:14.284 --> 01:10:15.472
- Linda.
- Hey, Linda.

01:10:15.577 --> 01:10:18.851
Sally, you should have told me.
I'm your best friend.

01:10:18.955 --> 01:10:22.271
- I didn't know he'd give me a ring.
- Roger, you should have told me.

01:10:22.375 --> 01:10:24.565
- You know you can't keep a secret.
- What?

01:10:24.669 --> 01:10:27.109
- Aren't you happy for me?
- I couldn't be happier.

01:10:27.213 --> 01:10:30.738
- What's going to happen to me?
- For God's sake, I'm only getting married.

01:10:30.842 --> 01:10:33.615
- Sally, won't you open your presents?
- Yeah.

01:10:33.720 --> 01:10:36.389
Please, go now. Open your presents.

01:10:37.682 --> 01:10:38.927
Linda.

01:10:40.518 --> 01:10:41.716
God.

01:10:43.188 --> 01:10:46.473
- God. I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

01:10:47.525 --> 01:10:49.352
- Let's go, let's go!
- All right!

01:10:49.486 --> 01:10:53.186
I'm happy for you.
I'm really happy for the both of you.

01:10:53.865 --> 01:10:55.512
Go out and open your presents.

01:10:55.617 --> 01:10:58.571
- I'm going to make some coffee, okay?
- All right, okay.

01:11:00.497 --> 01:11:02.822
- Be sure to make a pot of decaf, too.
- Okay.

01:11:03.875 --> 01:11:06.247
Okay, you guys, let's open those presents.

01:11:13.384 --> 01:11:14.214
Hi.

01:11:15.595 --> 01:11:16.626
God.

01:11:17.138 --> 01:11:19.297
You know, it's so easy for Sally.

01:11:20.099 --> 01:11:22.887
It's always been so easy for her.

01:11:24.229 --> 01:11:28.295
- I can't wait until I have plastic surgery.
- You're having plastic surgery?

01:11:28.399 --> 01:11:29.810
- Didn't I tell you?
- No.

01:11:30.235 --> 01:11:32.560
Yeah, I'm going to have plastic surgery.

01:11:32.862 --> 01:11:34.385
- You're kidding?
- No.

01:11:34.489 --> 01:11:38.222
I'm going to have a chin implant,
some cheek bones, and a different nose.

01:11:38.326 --> 01:11:41.141
- Why? You look terrific. Are you serious?
- Yeah.

01:11:41.246 --> 01:11:43.102
A doctor friend is going to do it.

01:11:43.206 --> 01:11:45.938
And he knows the makeup artist
from <i>The Dukes of Hazard.</i>

01:11:46.042 --> 01:11:48.035
He's going to redesign my face.

01:11:51.589 --> 01:11:55.801
Do you think there's a connection between
your plastic surgery and your workouts?

01:11:56.553 --> 01:11:58.592
- It's part of the same thing.
- Which is?

01:11:59.222 --> 01:12:00.846
I want to be perfect.

01:12:02.141 --> 01:12:03.706
The most perfect you can be.

01:12:03.810 --> 01:12:07.126
That's what I want to be,
the most perfect me possible.

01:12:07.230 --> 01:12:09.104
- And you'll do anything.
- Anything.

01:12:10.108 --> 01:12:13.632
If you perfect yourself,
you'll be loved, is that what you're saying?

01:12:13.736 --> 01:12:15.943
Yeah. Well, you put that really nice.

01:12:16.364 --> 01:12:19.698
The most important thing as a reward
for perfection is love. Right?

01:12:20.076 --> 01:12:23.030
Yeah. Sally thinks I'm mentally unstable.

01:12:28.084 --> 01:12:30.540
How many spoonfuls of coffee
have I put in there?

01:12:30.879 --> 01:12:31.874
I don't know.

01:12:33.673 --> 01:12:35.998
I'm so drunk I can't remember.

01:12:41.097 --> 01:12:45.177
Adam, are you going to make
a pass at me or not?

01:12:46.102 --> 01:12:48.593
You know, you can have me. I'm available.

01:12:48.730 --> 01:12:50.769
Thank you, but it's against the rules.

01:12:51.649 --> 01:12:55.729
Well, since when have you been so ethical?
Everybody knows you're seeing Jessie.

01:13:00.492 --> 01:13:01.606
I'm sorry.

01:13:02.452 --> 01:13:05.951
I guess I'll go and see
if I can scare up a gang-bang.

01:13:18.426 --> 01:13:20.964
These are really nice, Mary. Thank you.

01:13:44.536 --> 01:13:47.287
- Mary, see if you can find Adam for me.
- Sure.

01:13:56.005 --> 01:13:56.986
Yes?

01:13:57.090 --> 01:13:59.279
- <i>How's it going?</i>
- Well, you got your story.

01:13:59.384 --> 01:14:01.699
- <i>What's the lead?</i>
- It's just as I promised you.

01:14:01.803 --> 01:14:05.635
Airheads, inflated bodies.
I call it "Looking for Mr. Goodbody."

01:14:05.807 --> 01:14:07.496
- <i>That's a good cover head.</i>
- Yeah.

01:14:07.600 --> 01:14:11.208
- <i>How soon can we have it?</i>
- When do you need to decide on the cover?

01:14:11.312 --> 01:14:14.895
- <i>I have to have it tomorrow.</i>
- Yeah, well, I'm almost through.

01:14:15.441 --> 01:14:18.674
Can't wait to get through with this
and move on to something else.

01:14:18.778 --> 01:14:22.361
- <i>Got anything in mind?</i>
- How about I go after Bowles in Morocco?

01:14:22.615 --> 01:14:23.860
I'll think about it.

01:14:23.992 --> 01:14:27.692
By the way, turn on your radio.
The McKenzie story's all over the airwaves.

01:14:27.954 --> 01:14:31.038
Somebody gave UPI an advance copy
and they put out a bulletin.

01:14:31.708 --> 01:14:34.874
- You didn't give it to them, did you?
- Of course not. Did you?

01:14:35.795 --> 01:14:39.403
- Hold on, someone's at the door.
- <i>I'm on my way out. I'll call you later.</i>

01:14:39.507 --> 01:14:40.503
All right, 'bye.

01:14:47.849 --> 01:14:49.129
Can I come in?

01:14:54.898 --> 01:14:56.178
Want a cup of coffee?

01:14:59.194 --> 01:15:00.604
It's not too hot.

01:15:01.654 --> 01:15:04.276
This isn't for me.
This is for my friend, the coach.

01:15:04.949 --> 01:15:08.223
He's back with his wife and has a new job.
Avoid using his name.

01:15:08.328 --> 01:15:09.703
Hey, listen.

01:15:12.457 --> 01:15:15.078
Here, I'm not using it. I didn't copy it.

01:15:15.668 --> 01:15:18.734
I didn't use your name.
You're not in my article. Okay?

01:15:18.838 --> 01:15:20.119
I give you my word.

01:15:26.179 --> 01:15:27.459
Jessie.

01:15:35.063 --> 01:15:36.890
You called me a sphincter muscle.

01:15:38.650 --> 01:15:40.477
You are one.

01:15:43.279 --> 01:15:46.613
- Who is it?
- It's Frankie. I just checked in.

01:15:46.825 --> 01:15:48.472
I'll call you later, Frankie.

01:15:48.576 --> 01:15:51.826
- I've got something for you.
- Forget it. I'll call you later.

01:15:52.163 --> 01:15:55.864
Come on, Adam. Open the door.
What's going on in there?

01:15:56.501 --> 01:15:58.161
You got somebody in there?

01:16:01.631 --> 01:16:02.778
Do you ever.

01:16:02.882 --> 01:16:06.156
Jessie, this is Frankie Smith.
She's one of our best photographers.

01:16:06.261 --> 01:16:07.992
Not one of, the best.

01:16:08.096 --> 01:16:10.468
Here's an advance copy
of the McKenzie issue.

01:16:10.723 --> 01:16:14.092
They used your horrendous photographs.
Even gave him credit.

01:16:14.519 --> 01:16:17.306
Do I know you?
You look very familiar to me.

01:16:19.065 --> 01:16:20.170
I don't think so.

01:16:20.275 --> 01:16:22.979
Jessie's an instructor
at the Sports Connection.

01:16:23.361 --> 01:16:25.934
I see why you call it the Sports Erection.

01:16:27.782 --> 01:16:29.989
I got to go. Thanks for the tape.

01:16:31.661 --> 01:16:33.286
You look very familiar to me.

01:16:37.876 --> 01:16:39.251
Great piece.

01:16:39.502 --> 01:16:41.775
Referring, of course,
to the McKenzie story.

01:16:41.880 --> 01:16:45.046
- Frankie, get out of here. I got work to do.
- For sure.

01:16:45.175 --> 01:16:48.674
- What time do you need me?
- I don't know, 1:30 or 2:00. I'll call you.

01:16:49.053 --> 01:16:51.869
Good, that will give me enough time
to find an assistant.

01:16:51.973 --> 01:16:54.546
And anything else I need
to get me through the day.

01:16:56.311 --> 01:16:59.043
Jesus! I forgot to tell you.

01:16:59.147 --> 01:17:02.087
I already shot the cover. It's amazing.

01:17:02.192 --> 01:17:06.272
Mark had this great idea.
Christie Brinkley in a leotard. Sensational.

01:17:06.613 --> 01:17:07.775
See you.

01:17:27.091 --> 01:17:31.116
<i>United Press International reports that
it has an interview with Joseph McKenzie.</i>

01:17:31.221 --> 01:17:34.870
<i>It's the only interview McKenzie's given
since his arrest on drug charges.</i>

01:17:34.974 --> 01:17:37.665
<i>In it, he claims
the State Department framed him...</i>

01:17:37.769 --> 01:17:41.460
<i>because he was negotiating to sell
computers to an Iron Curtain country.</i>

01:17:41.564 --> 01:17:44.435
<i>The interview will be published</i>
<i>in</i> Rolling Stone <i>magazine.</i>

01:17:44.943 --> 01:17:47.675
- Sorry they forgot to mention your name.
- Yeah, I'm not.

01:17:47.779 --> 01:17:49.059
- So this is it?
- Yes.

01:17:49.239 --> 01:17:51.387
- You know what you want?
- Yes. Exactly.

01:17:51.491 --> 01:17:52.191
Great.

01:17:53.910 --> 01:17:55.155
Okay, guys, I need a little ass.

01:17:55.370 --> 01:17:58.406
- Okay, guys.
- Don't be embarrassed, just take them off.

01:17:58.706 --> 01:18:00.580
It's okay, make me suffer. Come on.

01:18:00.750 --> 01:18:03.691
- Come on.
- What's my mother gonna say about this?

01:18:03.795 --> 01:18:05.455
I'm in pain. All right, good.

01:18:05.672 --> 01:18:08.362
Be in love with yourself
and look this way. All of you.

01:18:08.466 --> 01:18:10.625
Let's go, you just sweat it. Great.

01:19:59.619 --> 01:20:00.734
Four more!

01:20:02.539 --> 01:20:04.033
Twos!

01:20:07.460 --> 01:20:08.491
Singles!

01:20:14.467 --> 01:20:15.498
Come on!

01:20:15.718 --> 01:20:17.533
What are you doing?
She's not in the story.

01:20:17.637 --> 01:20:19.076
- Why not?
- Give me a break.

01:20:19.180 --> 01:20:21.036
- You got enough pictures.
- All right.

01:20:21.140 --> 01:20:24.289
I'm flying to New York tonight.
Scott's taking me to the airport.

01:20:24.394 --> 01:20:25.416
See you there.

01:20:25.520 --> 01:20:28.604
- I want those that you took.
- You got them. Good shoot.

01:20:37.740 --> 01:20:40.694
Five, six, seven, eight!

01:20:46.040 --> 01:20:47.072
Over!

01:21:08.980 --> 01:21:12.064
Five, six, seven, eight!

01:21:29.042 --> 01:21:32.208
I'm glad I met you.
And I'm sorry I met you.

01:21:33.338 --> 01:21:35.544
I'm glad that you're glad you met me.

01:21:36.424 --> 01:21:38.880
I'm sorry that you're sorry you met me.

01:21:41.888 --> 01:21:46.016
- I thought you put a "don't disturb" on it?
- I did. It must be important.

01:21:49.687 --> 01:21:50.719
Hello.

01:21:52.565 --> 01:21:56.065
It's the Associated Press.
I'd better take it. Yeah, send it through.

01:21:56.194 --> 01:21:58.352
Hello? Yes, hello, Fred.

01:21:59.405 --> 01:22:01.113
Well, of course I remember you.

01:22:02.784 --> 01:22:06.319
I really can't do this now.
It's not a good time. Can I call you back?

01:22:08.039 --> 01:22:09.320
All right.

01:22:09.833 --> 01:22:12.606
Just for a few minutes.
Let me ask you something, first.

01:22:12.710 --> 01:22:15.201
Do you have an advance copy
of the McKenzie piece?

01:22:16.840 --> 01:22:18.500
Really? Where did you get it?

01:22:20.009 --> 01:22:21.290
I'm just curious.

01:22:30.520 --> 01:22:31.551
Who?

01:22:34.107 --> 01:22:37.191
I've never heard of him.
I can't imagine how he got it.

01:22:45.618 --> 01:22:48.309
I've been working on the story
for several months now.

01:22:48.413 --> 01:22:49.611
What?

01:23:06.139 --> 01:23:09.175
Yes. Persistence and patience, yeah.

01:23:14.022 --> 01:23:15.302
No.

01:23:15.982 --> 01:23:18.307
I don't think he was using me.

01:23:25.325 --> 01:23:26.404
What?

01:23:41.841 --> 01:23:44.083
Well, what tapes are you talking about?

01:23:54.312 --> 01:23:55.771
No comment.

01:24:09.577 --> 01:24:12.033
I can't talk about that right now.

01:24:27.303 --> 01:24:28.335
How long?

01:24:42.861 --> 01:24:44.770
I don't know, three, four hours.

01:24:55.707 --> 01:24:57.913
That's right, in a limousine.

01:25:00.795 --> 01:25:03.286
We went around the park.

01:25:24.444 --> 01:25:28.358
Listen, really, I've got to go.
I'll talk to you at another time, okay?

01:25:37.373 --> 01:25:39.081
Yes, thanks for calling.

01:25:40.877 --> 01:25:41.992
Bye-bye.

01:25:43.546 --> 01:25:44.744
Sorry.

01:25:50.929 --> 01:25:54.013
- What are you doing?
- I read your little story.

01:25:54.807 --> 01:25:57.678
You lied to me. I'm erasing it.

01:25:58.144 --> 01:26:01.460
- You're not erasing it. Are you erasing it?
- Son of a bitch.

01:26:01.564 --> 01:26:03.640
- Jessie, you're overreacting.
- Yeah?

01:26:03.817 --> 01:26:06.799
- That's what the other reporter said.
- Don't compare us.

01:26:06.903 --> 01:26:10.153
- I didn't mention your name.
- Do you think I care about my name?

01:26:10.281 --> 01:26:13.931
You spoke of Emerson, baby-boomers,
and physical great awakening.

01:26:14.035 --> 01:26:17.226
All you did was write
about people getting in each other's pants.

01:26:17.330 --> 01:26:19.186
Everything I wrote is true!

01:26:19.290 --> 01:26:23.232
Everything the other reporter wrote
about me was true too, but it still hurts.

01:26:23.336 --> 01:26:27.879
It's not the truth I'm worried about,
it's the tone, and hurting and using people.

01:26:28.466 --> 01:26:29.613
You're disgusting.

01:26:29.717 --> 01:26:33.158
How can you be nice to somebody
like McKenzie and shit on Linda?

01:26:33.263 --> 01:26:36.161
What did she ever do to you
or anybody else?

01:26:36.266 --> 01:26:37.345
Nothing.

01:26:37.559 --> 01:26:40.165
What's wrong with wanting to be
the best you can be?

01:26:40.270 --> 01:26:42.808
What is so wrong
with wanting to be perfect?

01:26:43.606 --> 01:26:45.646
What's wrong with wanting to be loved?

01:26:46.609 --> 01:26:47.985
Nothing.

01:26:51.739 --> 01:26:53.399
You're going to ruin her life.

01:27:10.216 --> 01:27:11.212
Jessie!

01:27:16.306 --> 01:27:18.298
Jessie! Jessie!

01:27:20.185 --> 01:27:23.554
What are you doing?
Come on, Jessie, talk to me.

01:27:24.105 --> 01:27:27.521
- Open up, Jessie. Don't do this to me.
- Fuck you.

01:27:42.790 --> 01:27:45.246
I warned you not to put her name
in that article.

01:27:47.712 --> 01:27:49.123
Shit!

01:27:49.672 --> 01:27:52.294
Okay, start stirring towards the middle.
That's it.

01:27:52.425 --> 01:27:54.584
- Stirring.
- Just don't get carried away.

01:27:55.428 --> 01:27:58.827
- You need a little more, honey?
- I think you're doing wonderfully.

01:27:58.932 --> 01:28:01.173
Lauren, you've tipped it.

01:28:03.478 --> 01:28:06.763
- How often do you do this?
- Pretty often.

01:28:10.401 --> 01:28:11.382
- Honey.
- Yeah?

01:28:11.486 --> 01:28:12.758
- It's Adam.
- Okay.

01:28:12.862 --> 01:28:14.218
Stir down.

01:28:14.322 --> 01:28:17.074
- He says it's important.
- Keep going. Keep stirring.

01:28:17.492 --> 01:28:18.523
It looks good.

01:28:19.118 --> 01:28:22.184
Hello? Adam? You all right?

01:28:22.288 --> 01:28:24.364
You sound strange. Is something wrong?

01:28:24.666 --> 01:28:27.157
This is going to take longer
than I thought.

01:28:27.377 --> 01:28:30.793
What? You told me this morning
you were done with the damn thing.

01:28:31.506 --> 01:28:33.249
It's called "deadline."

01:28:35.134 --> 01:28:37.756
The best part is to eat it
while it's still smoking.

01:28:39.389 --> 01:28:40.764
What's going on there?

01:28:41.307 --> 01:28:44.707
We're making ice cream with
liquid nitrogen. In the morning, Adam.

01:28:44.811 --> 01:28:47.563
You've got no more time
because there is no more time.

01:28:49.774 --> 01:28:51.850
Right. You got your story.

01:29:19.304 --> 01:29:21.910
"The ghost of Emerson haunts
all the clubs in the land...

01:29:22.015 --> 01:29:24.538
"because they represent
a return to his values.

01:29:24.642 --> 01:29:28.250
"I seem to see old Ralph Waldo
on a small stage, a kind of podium...

01:29:28.354 --> 01:29:31.295
"almost preacher's pulpit.
But, he isn't preaching. No.

01:29:31.399 --> 01:29:34.631
"He's leading an aerobics class
and the whole country is joining in.

01:29:34.736 --> 01:29:37.676
"America is shaping up.
Physically, mentally, emotionally.

01:29:37.780 --> 01:29:39.109
"In all kinds of ways.

01:29:39.240 --> 01:29:42.556
"'Do that which is assigned thee, '
Emerson wrote in <i>Self-Reliance...</i>

01:29:42.660 --> 01:29:45.495
"'and thou canst not hope too much
or dare too much."'

01:29:46.456 --> 01:29:47.784
What is this?

01:29:48.500 --> 01:29:50.064
Has he gone crazy?

01:29:50.168 --> 01:29:53.567
It's not what he promised me.
This is not "Looking for Mr. Goodbody."

01:29:53.671 --> 01:29:55.664
Mary. Get me Adam Lawrence.

01:29:55.965 --> 01:29:58.739
What does Emerson have to do
with singles bars?

01:29:58.843 --> 01:30:01.630
- Has he gone nuts?
- Too many sprouts.

01:30:01.930 --> 01:30:04.800
- That's very funny.
- Too much exercise.

01:30:05.642 --> 01:30:07.681
Out there they call it bed aerobics.

01:30:07.977 --> 01:30:11.181
- Who's she? She looks very familiar.
- Her name is Jessie Wilson.

01:30:11.397 --> 01:30:14.813
- She looks familiar to me, too.
- She looks familiar to me, too.

01:30:15.109 --> 01:30:18.133
He's got a "don't disturb" until 12:00.
The car's downstairs.

01:30:18.238 --> 01:30:20.678
I'm going to Washington.
I can't print this shit.

01:30:20.782 --> 01:30:22.179
I'm gonna kill the thing.

01:30:22.283 --> 01:30:25.099
You can't kill the story, Mark.
You're already committed.

01:30:25.203 --> 01:30:29.070
- You can't change the cover now.
- You re-write it. You make sense of it.

01:30:29.249 --> 01:30:32.452
Get his notes, get his research.
Frankie was there, she'll help.

01:30:33.044 --> 01:30:34.325
I'll give it an edge.

01:30:34.712 --> 01:30:37.713
- Adam will be very upset.
- That's his problem, isn't it?

01:30:38.132 --> 01:30:40.823
He'll be out of town.
I'm sending him to Morocco.

01:30:40.927 --> 01:30:44.047
You do whatever you have to do.
He's an arrogant son of a bitch.

01:30:54.649 --> 01:30:56.143
Hello. Yeah.

01:30:57.861 --> 01:30:58.726
What?

01:31:00.113 --> 01:31:00.943
When?

01:31:11.291 --> 01:31:13.782
Hello. Yeah, just a minute.

01:31:14.043 --> 01:31:15.288
Jessie, it's Adam.

01:31:17.338 --> 01:31:19.130
I'm sorry. She won't talk to you.

01:31:20.383 --> 01:31:24.926
Yeah, sure, I'll tell her. 'Bye.
He told me to tell you just to trust him.

01:31:45.033 --> 01:31:46.195
Look what I found.

01:31:59.005 --> 01:32:00.499
I knew she looked familiar.

01:32:44.467 --> 01:32:46.376
Okay, now get at least ten copies.

01:32:47.971 --> 01:32:50.426
- Do you need any money?
- No, I've got some.

01:33:00.400 --> 01:33:01.016
Boy.

01:34:43.002 --> 01:34:45.790
- We can place your call now, Mr. Lawrence.
- Thank you.

01:34:52.470 --> 01:34:53.501
Thank you.

01:34:54.430 --> 01:34:55.452
Hello.

01:34:55.557 --> 01:34:58.288
Nous avons ouvert
la ligne avec Les Etats-Unis.

01:34:58.393 --> 01:35:00.551
- Vous parlez maintenant.
- <i>Oui. Merci.</i>

01:35:11.823 --> 01:35:12.523
Hello.

01:35:12.949 --> 01:35:16.863
Jessie, it's Adam. I'm calling
from Morocco. Can you hear me?

01:35:17.620 --> 01:35:20.538
I can hardly hear you.
Have you read the article yet?

01:35:21.457 --> 01:35:22.952
You are a sphincter muscle.

01:35:24.586 --> 01:35:25.451
Jessie.

01:35:27.046 --> 01:35:28.589
Operator. Operator.

01:35:32.886 --> 01:35:34.677
- Dita.
- Yes?

01:35:34.888 --> 01:35:36.002
It's for you.

01:35:42.103 --> 01:35:43.681
- Hello.
- <i>Dita.</i>

01:35:43.897 --> 01:35:45.355
- Adam?
- Dita.

01:35:45.773 --> 01:35:50.020
Adam, where are you?
This is a terrible connection.

01:35:50.487 --> 01:35:53.274
- Dita, do you have a copy of the new issue?
- <i>Yes.</i>

01:35:53.615 --> 01:35:56.948
- Is my story still in it?
- Yes.

01:35:58.203 --> 01:35:59.911
- Read it.
- What?

01:36:00.288 --> 01:36:02.957
- Read it!
- Okay.

01:36:06.753 --> 01:36:08.033
Okay, here goes.

01:36:08.713 --> 01:36:12.793
"Coed health clubs
are the new singles bars of the '80s."

01:36:13.384 --> 01:36:14.031
No.

01:36:14.135 --> 01:36:18.049
"They have actually usurped
the sounds and energy of the discos.

01:36:18.264 --> 01:36:21.051
"The aerobic jumps and..."
I got to go. 'Bye.

01:36:21.684 --> 01:36:23.642
- Hi, Mark.
- <i>Merde.</i>

01:36:25.021 --> 01:36:28.879
Sir, when Mr. Bowles comes, tell him
that I had to go back to the States.

01:36:28.983 --> 01:36:30.775
Tell him that it was an emergency.

01:36:59.305 --> 01:37:01.345
<i>May I have your attention, please?</i>

01:37:01.641 --> 01:37:05.721
<i>Announcing the arrival
of Pan Am flight 22 from Tokyo.</i>

01:37:06.187 --> 01:37:08.476
<i>Passengers are going through customs.</i>

01:37:08.731 --> 01:37:12.681
<i>They will be on the arrival level
in one half-hour. Thank you.</i>

01:37:16.489 --> 01:37:17.520
God.

01:37:26.666 --> 01:37:28.397
- Jessie Wilson, is she here?
- What?

01:37:28.501 --> 01:37:31.483
- Jessie Wilson, is she teaching today?
- Nobody's here.

01:37:31.588 --> 01:37:34.921
They're all over at the Beverly Hills Club
for some kind of benefit.

01:37:52.525 --> 01:37:53.556
Hey, Lawrence.

01:37:57.614 --> 01:37:58.645
Lawrence!

01:38:00.533 --> 01:38:01.909
You can't go that way.

- Linda, there's Adam.
- I can't believe it.

01:38:33.942 --> 01:38:36.090
There he is, behind her. See that?

01:38:36.194 --> 01:38:37.966
- Yeah.
- Roger, there's Adam.

01:38:38.071 --> 01:38:40.941
- What's he doing here?
- I'm glad he's here.

01:38:41.407 --> 01:38:44.029
- Why?
- Because I'm going to castrate him.

Jessie!

01:39:14.524 --> 01:39:16.433
Jessie, I didn't write it.

01:39:17.944 --> 01:39:20.980
You got to believe me, please.
Just let me explain.

01:39:21.656 --> 01:39:24.657
Leave her alone.
Haven't you caused enough trouble?

01:39:26.703 --> 01:39:30.783
Come on, keep it going. The side-saddle.
Let's go. Bend those knees, and breathe.

01:39:48.308 --> 01:39:49.802
Just get out of here, Adam.

01:39:50.268 --> 01:39:52.937
You got to let me explain to you.
I didn't write that.

01:39:53.271 --> 01:39:56.557
- It had your name on it, Adam.
- Why would I do that to you?

01:39:59.360 --> 01:40:01.270
Jessie, please, don't do this to me.

01:40:02.363 --> 01:40:04.937
Just leave me alone, Adam. Leave me alone.

01:40:05.116 --> 01:40:07.738
- Hey, Lawrence.
- Ladies, we're really sorry.

01:40:16.794 --> 01:40:17.993
I loved your piece.

01:40:19.756 --> 01:40:22.163
I don't forgive anyone
shitting on California.

01:40:22.342 --> 01:40:25.177
- Yeah, he called me an airhead, too.
- Son of a bitch.

<i>Please remain seated until the captain

Hi, Adam.

I thought he was in Morocco.

01:41:37.584 --> 01:41:40.157
- What are you doing?
- You rewrote my fucking story.

01:41:40.461 --> 01:41:45.800
- That thing was a lousy piece of crap.
- You rewrote my story, you little shit.

01:41:47.260 --> 01:41:48.505
Put that thing down.

01:41:50.096 --> 01:41:52.036
Who gave you the right
to put my name on it?

01:41:52.140 --> 01:41:53.662
You did, when you turned in...

01:41:53.766 --> 01:41:56.340
Why didn't you put your name
on that fucking shit?

01:41:56.728 --> 01:41:59.349
- Get out.
- You eat shit and die. I quit!

01:42:15.288 --> 01:42:16.533
You're pathetic.

01:42:21.920 --> 01:42:25.834
Mr. Lawrence? We're from the FBI,
and we have a subpoena for you.

01:42:54.452 --> 01:42:57.026
<i>This is Adam Lawrence.

if you're still talking to me.</i>

01:44:14.699 --> 01:44:17.320

<i>I don't care what you did at the office.
You must call today.</i>

- He has no comment.
- Give me a break, no comment.

01:44:58.952 --> 01:45:02.142
He's a reporter who can go to jail
over the First Amendment.

01:45:02.247 --> 01:45:03.824
Are you prepared to do that?

01:45:04.541 --> 01:45:06.782
Will you go to jail
over the First Amendment?

01:45:07.293 --> 01:45:10.484
<i>By refusing to talk,
Lawrence left unanswered whether...</i>

01:45:10.588 --> 01:45:15.416
<i>when he appears in court,
he will turn over the tapes of his interview.</i>

01:45:15.718 --> 01:45:19.301

- Mr. Lawrence, what is your occupation?
- I'm a reporter.

01:45:47.458 --> 01:45:49.747
- You currently employed, sir?
- No, I'm not.

01:45:50.128 --> 01:45:53.248
Directing your attention to June.
Were you employed?

01:45:53.464 --> 01:45:55.541
- Yes.
- And who was your employer?

01:45:56.801 --> 01:45:58.198
<i>Rolling Stone</i> magazine.

01:45:58.303 --> 01:46:02.881
As a <i>Rolling Stone</i> reporter, did you ever
interview the defendant in this case?

01:46:04.434 --> 01:46:05.289
Yes, I did.

01:46:05.393 --> 01:46:08.679
Do you recall when and where
this interview took place?

01:46:10.190 --> 01:46:12.348
In New York City, June 14. Central Park.

01:46:13.526 --> 01:46:15.353
- Did you record the interview?
- Yes.

01:46:15.695 --> 01:46:17.569
How did you record the interview?

01:46:23.786 --> 01:46:26.574
It was a portable tape recorder.

01:46:27.499 --> 01:46:30.535
- And how long was the interview?
- Three hours.

01:46:31.669 --> 01:46:34.873
How many tapes did you use
to record this three-hour interview?

01:46:35.131 --> 01:46:36.080
Three tapes.

01:46:36.341 --> 01:46:40.290
Did you bring those tapes with you,
pursuant to the government's subpoena?

01:46:46.267 --> 01:46:47.206
No, I did not.

01:46:47.310 --> 01:46:50.181
- Are those tapes still in your possession?
- Yes.

01:46:50.855 --> 01:46:54.058
So you could have produced those tapes,
had you been so inclined?

01:46:54.567 --> 01:46:55.730
Yes, I could have.

01:46:55.860 --> 01:46:59.009
I move that you direct the witness
to turn over the tapes...

01:46:59.113 --> 01:47:03.407
or find him in contempt for willingly
and knowingly violating a court order.

01:47:03.743 --> 01:47:09.579
Mr. Lawrence, if I were to give you
until 4:00 this afternoon to produce...

01:47:09.874 --> 01:47:13.065
the tapes of your June 14 interview,
would you do so?

01:47:13.169 --> 01:47:14.794
No, sir, I'd have to decline.

01:47:15.338 --> 01:47:19.170
I am warning you, Mr. Lawrence,
that if you adhere to that position...

01:47:19.425 --> 01:47:22.282
I'll have no choice
but to find you in contempt...

01:47:22.387 --> 01:47:24.344
and I will imprison you forthwith.

01:47:24.973 --> 01:47:28.057
Now, do you understand
the gravity of your position?

01:47:28.518 --> 01:47:30.843
Sir, I do, but I have no choice here.

01:47:31.437 --> 01:47:35.850
I promised that no one would ever hear
those tapes, especially the prosecutor.

01:47:36.776 --> 01:47:40.644
- I gave him my word.
- All right, Mr. Lawrence.

01:47:41.447 --> 01:47:43.689
I dislike doing this,
but I have no choice.

01:47:44.617 --> 01:47:50.288
You are in contempt of court and
I'm ordering that you be imprisoned until...

01:47:50.748 --> 01:47:53.286
you decide to comply with the subpoena...

01:47:53.668 --> 01:47:56.835
and surrender the tapes
to the U.S. Attorney's office.

01:47:58.298 --> 01:48:00.789
We'll take a 10-minute recess.

01:48:18.818 --> 01:48:21.107
Excuse me, are you Jessie Wilson?

01:51:21.459 --> 01:51:22.490
Adam!

01:51:41.062 --> 01:51:44.431
- I understand you've reached a verdict.
- Yes, sir, we have.

01:51:44.941 --> 01:51:47.397
Would you please hand the verdict
to the bailiff?

01:51:49.988 --> 01:51:52.027
Will the clerk please read the verdict?

- Would you do it again?
- I would do it again. Yes.

What are you going to do next?
Was it worth it?

Adam, will you be going back
to work for <i>Rolling Stone</i> ?

01:52:44.834 --> 01:52:45.865
