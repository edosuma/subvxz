00:01.044 --> 00:03.960
[speaking foreign language]

00:04.004 --> 00:05.483
WOMAN:
Previously onMotherland.

00:05.527 --> 00:08.008
Long ago, six sisters
embarked on a mission

00:08.051 --> 00:09.748
to bring the Power
of Speech to men.

00:09.792 --> 00:11.446
WOMAN: The Mother
brought me back

00:11.489 --> 00:13.187
to find the pieces
of the first song

00:13.230 --> 00:15.058
whose music will heal the world.

00:15.102 --> 00:17.495
I was told of one of those
pieces and so was Alder.

00:17.539 --> 00:19.845
A piece of the song
still remains to be found.

00:19.889 --> 00:22.152
The Abyssinian Line
has been lost entirely.

00:22.196 --> 00:23.762
-Where are you heading?
-Africa,

00:23.806 --> 00:25.068
tracking the Abyssinian Line.

00:25.112 --> 00:26.809
TALLY: I saw a vision of Raelle

00:26.852 --> 00:28.332
destroying the world
with the Witchbomb.

00:28.376 --> 00:31.335
Witches call this thing
their Mother.

00:31.379 --> 00:33.511
Our scholars believe it
to be the source of their power.

00:33.555 --> 00:34.991
MAN: I'll be
personally overseeing

00:35.035 --> 00:36.427
the administration
of the poison.

00:36.471 --> 00:38.821
I will break the binds
of the Salem Accord

00:38.864 --> 00:41.041
and I will lead
these United States

00:41.084 --> 00:43.391
towards a better world,
free from the witches.

00:43.434 --> 00:45.175
Silver is Camarilla.

00:45.219 --> 00:47.482
He tried
to kill President Wade.

00:47.525 --> 00:49.875
So much of our history
was stolen from us.

00:49.919 --> 00:51.486
Who knows
what we were capable of?

00:52.704 --> 00:54.184
I hope you're feeling rested.

00:54.228 --> 00:57.100
We have a lot to accomplish,
Mr. President.

00:57.144 --> 00:58.449
Hello, Mother.

00:58.493 --> 00:59.842
Fort Salem has fallen.

00:59.885 --> 01:00.886
Rae?

01:02.323 --> 01:05.456
[tense music playing]

01:07.067 --> 01:10.070
[tense music playing]

01:16.163 --> 01:18.165
Whoa. I'm okay.
I'm okay. I'm fine.

01:18.208 --> 01:20.080
-I'm fine.
-No, you're not.

01:20.123 --> 01:21.777
Wade's en route to the Cession.

01:21.820 --> 01:23.126
Washington's not safe.
Still crawling with Camarilla.

01:23.170 --> 01:24.867
What's happening on the base?

01:24.910 --> 01:26.129
Electronics are blocking
most channels and far speech,

01:26.173 --> 01:27.348
but we have reached
General Clary

01:27.391 --> 01:28.697
and here's what we know.

01:28.740 --> 01:30.090
Half are active duty personnel.

01:30.133 --> 01:31.700
They're still
in the Cession still.

01:31.743 --> 01:33.397
They picked
the right time to do this.

01:33.441 --> 01:35.138
They have all the entrances
and exits to the base.

01:35.182 --> 01:36.922
Their focus is clearly
the Mycelial Chamber

01:36.966 --> 01:39.403
and the Necro Facility.
They may already be close.

01:39.447 --> 01:42.102
That's not all. We see
significant movement of troops.

01:42.145 --> 01:43.451
Real numbers.

01:43.494 --> 01:45.061
We're in the air in five.

01:47.107 --> 01:49.239
We're staying here.
We can do this.

01:49.283 --> 01:51.633
When Adler was sick, it helped
her to be close to the Mycelium.

01:51.676 --> 01:53.330
-I have to come.
-Are you sure?

01:53.374 --> 01:55.071
Yes. I can fight.

01:55.115 --> 01:58.292
And, no, I'm not gonna
blow up the world, Tally.

01:58.335 --> 02:00.076
Fort Salem is our home.

02:00.120 --> 02:01.556
Let's defend it.

02:05.951 --> 02:07.214
One more then?

02:13.176 --> 02:15.613
-One last hurrah.
-Let's finish this.

02:15.657 --> 02:17.354
For goddess and country.

02:20.792 --> 02:22.794
[gasping]

02:36.721 --> 02:38.593
What are you doing with her?

02:42.031 --> 02:43.032
[grunts]

02:45.077 --> 02:47.384
HEARST: Admiring your work.

02:51.258 --> 02:53.434
We have a lot more in common
than you think.

02:55.044 --> 02:56.611
[hums]

03:04.532 --> 03:06.098
Hi, Pene.

03:06.142 --> 03:07.317
[tapping]

03:08.666 --> 03:10.146
Remember me?

03:12.279 --> 03:14.019
How's Basic?

03:14.063 --> 03:16.326
You taking a semester off?

03:16.370 --> 03:18.023
[screams]

03:22.767 --> 03:25.944
HEARST: Have it stored
in our facility off sight.

03:25.988 --> 03:28.033
Penny and I have
a lot of catching up to do.

03:35.084 --> 03:36.694
[chuckles]

03:38.696 --> 03:39.697
Oh...

03:40.872 --> 03:42.222
-HEARST: Hey...
-No.

03:43.527 --> 03:47.749
So, tell me about the Mother
and this is all over.

03:48.880 --> 03:52.101
Do you think
she'll pop or shrivel?

03:52.144 --> 03:57.106
There's only one thing
you need to know.

03:57.149 --> 03:59.021
-Uh-huh?
-IZADORA: [laughs]

04:05.984 --> 04:08.944
She's gonna kill you all.

04:19.215 --> 04:20.085
Give her more.

04:21.696 --> 04:23.306
It's gonna be a wild night.

[buzzing sound]

07:03.466 --> 07:06.426
General Adler
returned from the dead.

07:07.862 --> 07:09.820
We heard reports
about your reemergence

07:09.864 --> 07:13.345
but we have to see it
for ourselves.

07:13.389 --> 07:15.565
-I mean no harm here.
-State your business

07:15.609 --> 07:17.262
in the free Republic of Ghana.

07:17.306 --> 07:18.655
My business is my own.

07:18.699 --> 07:20.527
Your presence here represents

07:20.570 --> 07:23.660
nothing less
than a military incursion.

07:23.704 --> 07:26.489
There is no storm
of mine out there.

07:26.533 --> 07:27.751
Not yet.

07:27.795 --> 07:29.231
Here you are.

07:34.628 --> 07:36.760
Am I?

07:36.804 --> 07:38.588
[suspenseful music playing]

07:38.632 --> 07:40.329
What is this?

07:40.372 --> 07:43.419
[tense music playing]

07:53.342 --> 07:55.126
PETRA:
Get to the Necro Facility.

07:55.170 --> 07:56.693
You're gonna have to fight
your way through.

07:56.737 --> 07:58.086
You know their tech.
They're adapting on a fly.

07:58.129 --> 08:00.131
-We gotta do the same.
-We need scourges.

08:00.175 --> 08:01.611
There's a bunch
in the training room.

08:01.655 --> 08:03.831
You're gonna have
to be quick about it.

08:03.874 --> 08:05.659
Wait.

08:05.702 --> 08:09.314
I just wanna say how proud I am
to know all three of you.

08:09.358 --> 08:11.926
The moment we met,
I knew there was something else.

08:11.969 --> 08:14.755
This odd, beautiful,

08:14.798 --> 08:16.800
precisely perfect
combination of your talents.

08:16.844 --> 08:18.889
Everybody saw it.
Everybody knew.

08:18.933 --> 08:22.284
Never doubt that, all right?

08:23.415 --> 08:25.069
Never doubt what you've built.

08:26.331 --> 08:28.116
And look out for that one.

08:34.644 --> 08:36.167
[dramatic music playing]

08:39.562 --> 08:41.825
ANACOSTIA: All right. All right.

08:41.869 --> 08:42.870
Go.

08:48.832 --> 08:51.226
Greg said there were more
scourges over here.

08:51.269 --> 08:54.098
-Greg, huh? We're Greg now.
-Wow. You don't mess around.

08:54.142 --> 08:56.710
Nice little charge up
with the wedding there, Tal?

08:56.753 --> 08:58.059
Always good before a battle.

08:58.102 --> 08:59.800
And?

08:59.843 --> 09:01.889
He was so good.

09:01.932 --> 09:04.282
-Hey, you weren't the only one.
-Not by a long shot.

09:04.326 --> 09:06.720
You too? Wait,
when did you have time?

09:06.763 --> 09:08.983
Wives make time for such things.

09:10.245 --> 09:12.290
Every entrance to the lab
is heavily guarded.

09:12.334 --> 09:15.163
The best way is the hallway
next to the lecture halls.

09:15.206 --> 09:18.079
There's a stairway that takes us
very close to Izadora office.

09:18.122 --> 09:19.297
Let's go.

09:23.258 --> 09:25.521
I have to get back
to Petra and Anacostia.

09:25.565 --> 09:29.090
The ground troops on the move.
I'll see you later.

09:29.133 --> 09:31.048
Okay.

09:31.092 --> 09:32.354
Bye.

09:35.966 --> 09:37.315
When we're not fighting
for our lives...

09:37.359 --> 09:38.578
[grunts]

09:38.621 --> 09:40.231
...we need to talk honeymoon.

09:42.146 --> 09:43.670
-Europe?
-Lot of churches.

09:43.713 --> 09:46.150
Damn, I'm gonna need
a beach after this.

09:46.194 --> 09:48.022
I've never been to the ocean?

09:50.241 --> 09:51.939
Beach it is.

09:51.982 --> 09:53.027
Let's go.

10:04.995 --> 10:07.041
[device hums]

10:09.696 --> 10:10.958
[beeps]

10:33.197 --> 10:35.373
-How are they?
-Fine. Armed.

10:35.417 --> 10:38.420
-What's happening here?
-They're waiting for orders.

10:38.463 --> 10:40.117
We don't have any time.

10:40.161 --> 10:40.988
We have to get
as many as we can at once.

10:41.031 --> 10:42.424
Yeah. Fast too.

10:42.467 --> 10:44.339
And whatever we do,
we can't let them hear us.

10:44.382 --> 10:46.384
Rings of Saturn.

10:46.428 --> 10:47.995
That wind-up is fast.

10:48.038 --> 10:49.387
We can tune subsonically.

10:49.431 --> 10:50.954
They won't know what's coming.

10:50.998 --> 10:53.870
Look, there are a lot
of trucks down there.

10:53.914 --> 10:56.612
If we work this right,
they won't have time to react.

10:56.656 --> 10:58.135
We have one chance.

10:59.963 --> 11:00.964
Let's do this.

11:07.144 --> 11:09.190
[low humming]

12:16.866 --> 12:17.911
No.

12:22.002 --> 12:23.177
Hey?

12:23.220 --> 12:26.310
We need to keep moving. Come on.

12:26.354 --> 12:28.791
-Wake up.
-There will be time to grieve.

12:28.835 --> 12:30.706
-There's nothing we can do.
-Wake up.

12:31.838 --> 12:33.883
Get to the lab.
Get to my daughter.

12:33.927 --> 12:35.189
My...

12:35.232 --> 12:36.494
She's gone, Sterling.

12:37.495 --> 12:39.106
We have a war to win.

12:41.064 --> 12:42.065
Wake up.

12:42.109 --> 12:44.764
Come on. Come on.

12:44.807 --> 12:47.767

[tense music playing]

12:58.778 --> 13:00.780
[grunting]

13:11.051 --> 13:12.835
They're coming right behind me.

13:12.879 --> 13:14.837
Some new kind
of troops they have.

13:14.881 --> 13:16.839
Is she okay?

13:16.883 --> 13:19.102
-No.
-The new armor,

13:19.146 --> 13:20.843
it can kill all sound.

13:20.887 --> 13:22.627
And not just work
but everything.

13:22.671 --> 13:25.239
But it's glitchy though.
They keep adjusting it.

13:26.153 --> 13:28.024
Go, go, go.

13:34.030 --> 13:36.119
LEDGER: We've received
new cargo from Ghana,

13:36.163 --> 13:39.557
including an uncanny one
called Orageuse,

13:39.601 --> 13:41.298
female of 19 years,

13:41.342 --> 13:44.171
with a vengeful look
that chills the blood.

13:44.214 --> 13:45.955
Luckily,
she's already been sold

13:45.999 --> 13:47.957
on to a planter in Virginia,

13:48.001 --> 13:49.437
just outside Roanoke,

13:49.480 --> 13:51.656
in the foothills
of Smith Mountain.

13:51.700 --> 13:55.617
Good riddance. She is said
to be some kind of witch.

13:56.748 --> 14:00.056
Ma'am, we found another book
from your list.

14:12.112 --> 14:15.071
[grunting]

14:18.422 --> 14:19.946
Where are they taking Penelope?

14:19.989 --> 14:22.687
Carry it to Izadora.
She'll know what to do.

14:22.731 --> 14:26.474
Sterling, I know
you loved Anacostia deeply.

14:26.517 --> 14:27.823
I do too.

14:28.868 --> 14:30.391
We fight for her.

[loud humming]

14:49.105 --> 14:50.454
[muffled] What is happening?

14:50.498 --> 14:52.892
-What's happening?
-Get back.

14:55.329 --> 14:57.418
Raelle. Raelle.

15:03.554 --> 15:05.948
Well, that's
an excellent trick, huh?

15:05.992 --> 15:07.950
We finally found our voices too.

15:07.994 --> 15:10.300
Now, you have to listen to me.

15:10.344 --> 15:13.347
You've interrupted
our important work here,

15:13.390 --> 15:15.566
but that's okay.

15:15.610 --> 15:19.005
We found a better way
to deliver our medicine.

15:20.789 --> 15:22.530
You don't look too good.

15:22.573 --> 15:24.836
Fungal infection?

15:47.598 --> 15:48.599
Raelle.

15:50.340 --> 15:52.168
Well, I didn't see that coming.

15:53.996 --> 15:56.042
But here's to happy accidents.

15:59.306 --> 16:01.395

16:19.804 --> 16:20.980

16:22.372 --> 16:23.460
Raelle.

16:24.548 --> 16:26.028
Where's Gregorio?

17:14.729 --> 17:16.731
[grunting]

17:37.926 --> 17:39.449
Where is Alder?

17:39.493 --> 17:41.277
What happened to Raelle
could have happened to her.

17:41.321 --> 17:43.018
What if she doesn't find
the last steward?

17:43.062 --> 17:44.846
Well, then Raelle
ends the world.

17:46.021 --> 17:47.153
Then Adil dies.

17:47.196 --> 17:48.676
Everyone dies.

17:48.719 --> 17:50.808
None of this makes sense.

17:50.852 --> 17:53.246
Maybe we just can't see it
from down here.

17:53.289 --> 17:54.943
-The Necro?
-No.

17:54.986 --> 17:56.684
I mean, like a human scale.

17:56.727 --> 17:58.947
-This is bigger than us.
-GREGORIO: Tally.

18:08.087 --> 18:09.392
We lost you.

18:09.436 --> 18:10.959
They pushed me back
in the hallway.

18:11.002 --> 18:12.352
I have to get out
of a tight spot.

18:12.395 --> 18:14.571
A couple actually.

18:14.615 --> 18:16.921
[suspenseful music playing]

18:21.187 --> 18:23.319
[low humming]

18:32.763 --> 18:34.765
[engine revs]

18:43.078 --> 18:45.559
[upbeat music playing]

18:46.603 --> 18:48.127
[screams]

18:58.833 --> 19:00.356
NICTE: Wade sent me.

19:04.534 --> 19:06.188
Nice work, Batan.

19:06.232 --> 19:07.363
Where's the rest?

19:07.407 --> 19:09.452
Back there, in bad shape.

19:09.496 --> 19:10.932
And we're trapped here too.

19:10.975 --> 19:12.499
We'll see about that.

19:12.542 --> 19:14.022
I don't like being trapped.

19:24.467 --> 19:28.079
[grunting]

19:43.617 --> 19:45.619
[singing indistinctly]

19:58.632 --> 20:00.416
Hey, guys, in here!

20:00.460 --> 20:02.418
-Is that Raelle?
-I think so.

20:06.901 --> 20:08.816
Tally, you should see this.

20:08.859 --> 20:10.165
Raelle opened another door.

20:12.080 --> 20:13.081
[grunting]

20:14.430 --> 20:16.040
All right. Come on!

20:18.086 --> 20:20.088
Go. Take care of your friends.

20:20.131 --> 20:22.656
-He and I can hold them off.
-See you on the other side.

20:27.313 --> 20:29.228
[hisses]

20:34.233 --> 20:37.236
[tense music playing]

20:58.866 --> 21:01.085
This is what I saw, guys.

21:02.348 --> 21:03.610
When I ended of the world?

21:04.654 --> 21:05.655
Great.

21:07.701 --> 21:09.093
Scylla. Scylla.

21:09.137 --> 21:10.573
-Scylla.
-What's happening?

21:10.617 --> 21:12.009
I don't know. I can help them.
I can help them.

21:12.053 --> 21:13.794
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

21:13.837 --> 21:15.578
It's okay. Stay with me.
I got you.

21:16.710 --> 21:18.277
Ask and it shall be given you.

21:18.320 --> 21:19.974
Knock and it shall be answered.

21:22.585 --> 21:23.978
Why isn't it working?

21:27.329 --> 21:28.591
What now? What now?

21:28.635 --> 21:30.376
-Please.
-Tally.

21:30.419 --> 21:32.073
Tally, help.

21:32.116 --> 21:33.988
-No, I don't know. I...
-She's gonna die.

21:35.119 --> 21:36.120
No.

21:37.165 --> 21:40.037
Alder, if you can hear me,

21:41.517 --> 21:43.867
now would be
a really good moment.

21:43.911 --> 21:45.216
Tally, please.

21:48.045 --> 21:50.483
Alder.

21:58.926 --> 22:00.841
SILVER: Are you sure
this is gonna work?

22:00.884 --> 22:02.408
Positive.

22:02.451 --> 22:05.149
And when is Kara gonna get here?

22:05.193 --> 22:06.194
She's not.

22:07.238 --> 22:09.066
She sends her regrets.

22:09.110 --> 22:11.112
She really wanted to be here.

22:12.505 --> 22:15.116
The airwaves are yours, Blant.

22:16.073 --> 22:20.295
In five, four, three, two...

22:22.036 --> 22:25.039
Our country has been shaken
to its foundation,

22:25.082 --> 22:28.129
and it is my duty
as the rightful president

22:28.172 --> 22:30.871
of the United States of America
to set it right again.

22:30.914 --> 22:34.135
And I ask of you, no.
I beg of you, as Americans,

22:34.178 --> 22:36.746
to ask yourselves
one simple question.

22:36.790 --> 22:38.095
It's me, Sterling.

22:38.139 --> 22:40.141
How can a witch
ever be trusted...

22:40.184 --> 22:43.318
-Penelope is down there.
-...when trickery, duplicity,

22:43.362 --> 22:45.973
and deceit
are their very nature?

22:46.016 --> 22:48.105
-They can change their faces.
-Make them pay.

22:48.149 --> 22:51.587
That woman who was pretending
to be Wade

22:51.631 --> 22:53.154
is a witch impostor.

22:53.197 --> 22:55.417
I put Wade in the ground myself.

22:55.461 --> 22:57.419
That woman was an American hero

22:57.463 --> 22:59.160
who served her country
for decades.

23:03.120 --> 23:04.774
You need to break the Link.

23:06.123 --> 23:07.342
I've got you, husband.

23:07.386 --> 23:09.518
I won't pull you under.

23:12.129 --> 23:13.566
Let me go when it's time.

23:16.177 --> 23:18.309
We're gonna get you
to the ocean,

23:18.353 --> 23:21.051
and then, we're gonna have
a great life, okay?

23:21.095 --> 23:23.967
So I really need you
to stay alive.

23:24.011 --> 23:26.187
That's how this is gonna go.

23:31.322 --> 23:33.542
We should have stayed
at the lighthouse.

23:36.023 --> 23:38.417
This is isn't so bad.

23:38.460 --> 23:40.680
Can I ask you something?

23:45.293 --> 23:46.294
SCYLLA: Anything.

23:47.469 --> 23:48.644
Why me?

23:49.906 --> 23:51.125
What do you mean?

23:51.168 --> 23:53.040
Everything that's happening,

23:53.083 --> 23:54.998
what's to come, why me?

23:55.042 --> 23:58.132
-That's easy.
-Yeah?

23:58.175 --> 24:00.874
You're the only one
strong enough to bear all this.

24:04.530 --> 24:05.661
TALLY: Yes.

24:05.705 --> 24:06.923
Okay. Got it.

24:06.967 --> 24:08.621
I figured it out.

24:08.664 --> 24:11.362
Everyone has always said
that we have this big destiny.

24:11.406 --> 24:13.147
Anacostia said tonight.

24:15.062 --> 24:16.367
Well, this is it.

24:16.411 --> 24:18.631
-I want another one.
-No.

24:18.674 --> 24:20.110
You want this one.

24:20.154 --> 24:22.112
It just doesn't seem
like it right now.

24:22.156 --> 24:24.071
Tally, I thought you couldn't
see the future anymore.

24:24.114 --> 24:25.376
I don't need to.

24:25.420 --> 24:27.030
I finally got it.

24:30.120 --> 24:31.948
This is about us.

24:31.992 --> 24:33.559
The three of us.

24:33.602 --> 24:36.126
It was never about
the first song

24:36.170 --> 24:37.780
or preventing the Witchbomb.

24:39.129 --> 24:41.001
All of it is gonna happen.

24:41.044 --> 24:42.524
All of it.

24:42.568 --> 24:44.787
It's about how we change it.

24:45.832 --> 24:47.137
Trust me.

24:49.792 --> 24:51.315
No, it's good, Tally.

24:54.014 --> 24:56.538
The Mother wouldn't
bring us this far...

25:01.935 --> 25:03.066
Would she?

25:14.295 --> 25:17.298
[tense music playing]

25:49.678 --> 25:53.203
AUGUSTA: Her name is not
Orageuse as they called her.

25:53.247 --> 25:56.816
Her name is Jem and she has
mighty work in her.

25:56.859 --> 26:00.646
More than me.
More than I've ever seen.

26:00.689 --> 26:02.343
I have papers
for her manumission

26:02.386 --> 26:04.606
with the attorney in Richmond.

26:04.650 --> 26:07.522
She raised my cousin's place
from the dirt

26:07.566 --> 26:09.437
and I cannot say I blame her

26:09.480 --> 26:11.961
after the way
she has been treated.

26:12.005 --> 26:16.183
I have seen no witch
sing two elements at once,

26:16.226 --> 26:19.055
but Jem does
so as easily as breathing.

26:19.099 --> 26:21.492
Earth and Sky
arrange themselves

26:21.536 --> 26:23.320
according to her songs.

26:23.364 --> 26:26.280
And in that, we have
barely scratched the surface.

26:26.323 --> 26:29.109
There is one song
she barely remembers.

26:29.152 --> 26:32.112
One she is afraid
to sing in full voice.

26:32.155 --> 26:34.984
A song from long ago,
grandmother

26:35.028 --> 26:37.117
passed through
the women in her line.

26:37.160 --> 26:40.599
A song held unsung
by generations,

26:40.642 --> 26:44.994
waiting for some precise
predetermined moment.

26:45.038 --> 26:47.127
A song that Jem says

26:47.170 --> 26:51.348
has the power to break
the world or make it,

26:51.392 --> 26:54.264
depending entirely
on how it's sung.

26:57.180 --> 26:59.356
HEARST: That was masterful.

27:08.627 --> 27:11.804
Talk more about Wade
when we get back on the air.

27:11.847 --> 27:14.371
How you knew Kelly personally

27:14.415 --> 27:17.070
and how that thing they trotted
out in court was not,

27:17.113 --> 27:19.072
in fact, Wade or human at all.

27:19.115 --> 27:20.290
Back in 30.

27:22.684 --> 27:24.947
And get into
the Ghana situation.

27:24.991 --> 27:27.471
Alder starts World War III.

27:31.911 --> 27:34.696
Oh, Blanton.

27:34.740 --> 27:36.350
It's all before us now,

27:36.393 --> 27:40.093
that dawn we've been
talking about for so long.

27:42.008 --> 27:45.011
You know what, Alban, why don't
you eat a big pile of shit.

27:45.054 --> 27:47.013
This isn't exactly going
as planned, is it?

27:48.492 --> 27:50.277
Bumps were to be expected.

27:51.582 --> 27:53.019
What about the mines?

27:53.062 --> 27:55.369
Are they working?
What the hell is taking so long?

27:55.412 --> 27:59.155
Doubt will come for you
in your greatest moment.

27:59.199 --> 28:01.157
Do not be seduced.

28:01.201 --> 28:02.724
Whatever you say, Alban.

28:04.421 --> 28:05.553
I'll shut up now.

28:06.772 --> 28:07.947
Do what you do.

28:09.035 --> 28:10.079
Be glorious.

28:17.957 --> 28:19.001
How's the coffee?

28:19.045 --> 28:20.350
It's a little bitter.

28:20.394 --> 28:25.312
In five, four, three, two...

28:26.530 --> 28:29.708
I met Kelly Wade at a softball
game many years ago.

28:31.100 --> 28:32.754
She is one
of my dearest friends.

28:32.798 --> 28:35.235
Kelly taught me everything
that I needed to know

28:35.278 --> 28:37.063
about leadership,

28:37.106 --> 28:39.761
which is why I know
that that was not Wade

28:39.805 --> 28:41.720
that they brought
into the courtroom.

28:42.764 --> 28:44.331
Should we...

28:46.072 --> 28:47.073
Alban?

29:04.525 --> 29:05.526
Pene?

29:06.614 --> 29:07.963
Was it worth it?

29:09.138 --> 29:10.444
Answer her.

29:12.011 --> 29:13.403
They told me that they weren't--

29:13.447 --> 29:14.578
that they weren't
gonna harm you.

29:14.622 --> 29:16.189
But you watched them inject me.

29:16.232 --> 29:17.494
They made me.

29:17.538 --> 29:19.583
You have no idea
how powerful they are.

29:19.627 --> 29:21.237
How about how powerful I am?

29:22.586 --> 29:26.155
Pene, I'm sorry. I am.

29:26.199 --> 29:27.809
I am so sorry.

29:27.853 --> 29:28.984
Me too, Daddy.

29:34.381 --> 29:36.035
I love you so much.

29:38.211 --> 29:39.212
You too.

30:03.410 --> 30:05.760
-What took you so long?
-ALDER: Let me explain.

30:05.804 --> 30:08.589
There's no time to waste.
You have to trust me now.

30:08.632 --> 30:10.721
I understand what's happening.

30:11.897 --> 30:13.072
Where's the last steward?

30:13.115 --> 30:14.116
Come.

30:15.161 --> 30:16.379
Abigail.

30:19.556 --> 30:22.733
We all know Jem Bellweather was
one of the most powerful witches

30:22.777 --> 30:24.213
this army has ever seen,

30:25.258 --> 30:27.651
but it turns out
this was just the beginning.

30:29.175 --> 30:31.742
Is that what all the Earth
and Sky stuff was about?

30:31.786 --> 30:35.877
The history of your family's
stewardship was taken from you,

30:35.921 --> 30:37.531
like so many histories.

30:37.574 --> 30:39.838
But the song, it remains in you.

30:41.143 --> 30:43.058
How will I know how to sing it?

30:44.581 --> 30:45.582
It's yours.

30:48.890 --> 30:50.065
You'll know how.

30:52.502 --> 30:55.027
Raelle, can you hear me?

30:56.593 --> 30:57.986
I'm sorry.

30:58.030 --> 30:59.596
No, no, it's okay.

30:59.640 --> 31:02.991
Everything I saw
has happened but it's okay.

31:03.035 --> 31:04.906
You're just gonna see
what comes next.

31:04.950 --> 31:05.951
What comes next?

31:05.994 --> 31:07.953
You will see.

31:07.996 --> 31:13.001
Just remember when we sing,
send the sound everywhere.

31:13.045 --> 31:14.176
Everywhere?

31:14.220 --> 31:17.179
The whole world.

31:17.223 --> 31:18.224
Okay, Tally, it's time.

31:18.267 --> 31:19.965
Everything is gonna be okay.

31:20.008 --> 31:21.140
I said it's time.

31:21.183 --> 31:22.489
-Okay.
-Get back.

31:22.532 --> 31:23.533
Okay.

31:38.418 --> 31:40.463
KHALIDA: [sings]

32:54.320 --> 32:56.148
You got to stop
blowing up, shitbird.

32:58.193 --> 32:59.499
We did something, Rae.

33:00.543 --> 33:01.762
You certainly did.

33:05.026 --> 33:05.984
RAELLE: Scylla?

33:07.246 --> 33:08.247
Scylla?

33:12.077 --> 33:13.687
You guys are gonna make it.

33:29.398 --> 33:30.617
[chuckles]

34:21.407 --> 34:23.104
We lost Anacostia.

34:28.544 --> 34:29.893
No.

34:31.460 --> 34:32.940
The woman was a hero.

34:33.984 --> 34:36.465
I am here because of her.

34:38.554 --> 34:40.121
She was loved by many.

34:41.601 --> 34:42.993
My daughter.

34:44.038 --> 34:45.039
She's fearless.

34:46.258 --> 34:48.042
Feared by those who crossed her.

34:49.783 --> 34:51.176
She saw the good in everyone.

34:54.222 --> 34:55.745
To Anacostia Quartermain.

34:55.789 --> 34:57.878
ALL: To Anacostia Quartermain.

34:57.921 --> 34:59.662
For those who dwell
on the Earth.

35:10.499 --> 35:14.373
Anacostia Quartermain,
hell of a witch.

35:15.809 --> 35:17.071
We need to talk.

35:18.986 --> 35:20.292
You think?

35:20.335 --> 35:22.163
Uh, let's get back to Wade.

35:22.207 --> 35:23.382
Yes, ma'am.

35:27.125 --> 35:28.387
What did you do?

35:28.430 --> 35:30.954
We're not exactly sure but...

35:34.697 --> 35:37.091
I'm fairly certain
we changed everything.

35:41.574 --> 35:44.577
[tense music playing]

36:00.462 --> 36:01.550
Do you mind?

36:06.251 --> 36:08.078
Anything for you, Sarah.

36:18.263 --> 36:19.612
I'm sorry for what I did.

36:21.353 --> 36:24.051
I see what it did to you
and you did not deserve that.

36:26.009 --> 36:27.576
I'm sorry I wasted so much time

36:27.620 --> 36:31.014
hating you instead
of enjoying life.

36:33.060 --> 36:35.889
I'm actually
an incredibly fun person.

36:37.499 --> 36:39.022
Have you met yourself?

36:41.938 --> 36:43.549
I heard you're working
with Wade.

36:44.854 --> 36:47.379
For a while, mostly.

36:47.422 --> 36:49.032
ALDER: Making amends?

36:49.076 --> 36:50.860
Like you're trying
to do with me.

36:52.688 --> 36:54.212
ALDER: Fun, you said?

37:13.187 --> 37:17.931
Guys, my sight is back.

37:20.107 --> 37:22.240
I can see so much more.

37:23.458 --> 37:25.504
You guys, it's happening...

37:26.548 --> 37:27.549
everywhere.

37:30.073 --> 37:31.249
It's beautiful.

37:33.338 --> 37:34.295
ALDER: Come.

37:36.123 --> 37:38.995
For the rest of us
who don't have our sight,

37:39.039 --> 37:40.606
she wants us to see.

38:02.018 --> 38:04.194
You're gonna
wanna listen carefully.

38:04.238 --> 38:06.240
The Mother wants a word.

38:16.555 --> 38:20.210
ALDER AND MYCELIUM: Long ago
I merged with six women.

38:20.254 --> 38:23.953
I changed their voices
and the way they hear.

38:23.997 --> 38:26.782
As my gifts traveled
down the lines,

38:26.826 --> 38:28.828
descendants of the six

38:28.871 --> 38:31.570
came to be known as witches

38:31.613 --> 38:35.530
and they came to be feared
for their gifts.

38:35.574 --> 38:39.142
And now my gift is freely given.

38:39.186 --> 38:41.231
Thanks to you three.

38:41.275 --> 38:47.063
They are weak,
all of them, singing one song.

38:47.107 --> 38:49.022
And the Camarilla?

38:49.065 --> 38:53.374
They are witches too,
like everyone else.

38:53.418 --> 38:55.376
You saw my plan.

38:55.420 --> 38:58.988
You saw how all the pieces
work together,

38:59.032 --> 39:01.687
the parts were all played.

39:01.730 --> 39:03.079
It won't be enough.

39:04.124 --> 39:05.343
That it's up to you.

39:06.431 --> 39:09.869
The world will need
new stewards.

39:09.912 --> 39:12.045
They will need your vision,

39:12.088 --> 39:16.179
your care, and your fury.

39:17.659 --> 39:19.139
Well done.

39:21.620 --> 39:23.709
They will call you goddesses.

39:30.759 --> 39:32.021
Did you get all that?

39:32.065 --> 39:34.023
[laughs]

39:34.067 --> 39:36.417
Does it mean
what I think it means?

39:36.461 --> 39:38.071
We're ancient.

39:38.114 --> 39:39.899
Like an old friend once said,

39:40.987 --> 39:42.815
"Witch is just a word
they call us."

39:44.207 --> 39:45.687
She has spoken.

39:47.080 --> 39:48.298
In fact...

39:49.865 --> 39:52.215
she has just told me
my work is done.

39:55.088 --> 39:57.917
Thank you for changing
the world, my daughters.

40:24.204 --> 40:28.904
When they call you goddesses,
make sure you live up to it.
