WEBVTT

00:02.881 --> 00:04.147
I like your suit.

00:04.149 --> 00:06.700
Oh, thanks. Got a couple
new outfits for work.

00:06.702 --> 00:08.652
How does it feel knowing
your fiancée's job

00:08.654 --> 00:10.787
is to go out
and flirt with doctors,

00:10.789 --> 00:13.490
looking like that,
while you sit here, you know...

00:13.492 --> 00:15.542
looking like this?

00:15.544 --> 00:18.161
She doesn't flirt
with doctors.

00:18.163 --> 00:20.297
Yeah. It's all
very professional.

00:20.299 --> 00:22.416
You know when you bend over,
I can see down your shirt?

00:22.418 --> 00:24.217
Okay, good.

00:24.219 --> 00:26.803
Speaking of new careers,
how are things going

00:26.805 --> 00:28.755
with dark matter,
Sheldon?

00:28.757 --> 00:31.425
Oh, yeah, I'd have to say
it's the most exiting time

00:31.427 --> 00:33.260
in the history of the field.
Oh.

00:33.262 --> 00:34.262
What's going on?

00:34.263 --> 00:36.813
I started doing it.

00:36.815 --> 00:38.015
You know, the government funded

00:38.017 --> 00:40.767
the biggest experiment yet
to detect dark matter.

00:40.769 --> 00:42.152
Oh, yeah,

00:42.154 --> 00:44.438
I've read about that--
they're sending research teams

00:44.440 --> 00:46.940
down into abandoned salt mines.
You know, Sheldon,

00:46.942 --> 00:49.076
if we apply to be
one of those teams,

00:49.078 --> 00:51.578
we could be on the ground floor
of something big--

00:51.580 --> 00:54.197
not just for theoretical physics
but for astrophysics as well.

00:54.199 --> 00:57.250
Wait, hang on-- you guys
are gonna work in a mine?

00:57.252 --> 00:58.452
Why not?
You had

00:58.454 --> 01:01.338
a panic attack when
we went through the car wash.

01:01.340 --> 01:04.291
Perhaps the emotion
you're referring to was shock

01:04.293 --> 01:06.877
at you having something cleaned.

01:07.930 --> 01:10.163
I think what Penny meant is,
the thought of you two

01:10.165 --> 01:13.934
in a mine is kind of funny--
it's like a cat riding a Roomba.

01:15.003 --> 01:16.470
If they get scared,
they'll have those hats

01:16.472 --> 01:18.138
with the lights on them,
'cause down there

01:18.140 --> 01:20.974
it's night-night all the time!

01:20.976 --> 01:22.075
Maybe they could

01:22.077 --> 01:24.111
ride around in one of
those mine carts that go,

01:24.113 --> 01:26.696
ee-oo-ee-oo-ee-oo.

01:26.698 --> 01:30.817
Yeah, it'll help them get away
when they see a gh-gh-ghost...!

01:31.620 --> 01:34.237
Are they making fun of us?
Yup.

01:34.239 --> 01:37.157
I miss the old days
when I couldn't tell.

02:06.854 --> 02:09.354
So, one of my favorite
video games of all time

02:09.357 --> 02:11.874
is called Shadow of the Colossus,
and it was only

02:11.876 --> 02:13.109
for PlayStation 2,

02:13.111 --> 02:15.027
but then they came out
with a new version

02:15.029 --> 02:16.329
for PS3 with better graphics.

02:16.331 --> 02:18.114
I finally got the chance
to play it,

02:18.116 --> 02:21.651
and for some reason, it just
wasn't as good as the first one.

02:26.040 --> 02:28.708
Or something about yoga.

02:28.710 --> 02:31.677
I'm sorry--
I was thinking about work.

02:31.679 --> 02:34.096
Well, I was just saying that
there was this video game...

02:34.098 --> 02:36.632
Yeah, that's when I started
thinking about work.

02:36.634 --> 02:39.101
Uh, listen, I've got
some good news.

02:39.103 --> 02:41.103
Hmm.

02:41.105 --> 02:42.722
This is for you.

02:42.724 --> 02:44.390
Huh.

02:47.061 --> 02:48.828
What is this?

02:48.830 --> 02:50.763
Well, you know how
they gave me the company car?

02:50.765 --> 02:53.065
Didn't make sense to have two,
so I sold the other one.

02:53.067 --> 02:54.817
The one I gave you?

02:54.819 --> 02:57.370
Yeah. And there's your money
back-- and now we're even.

02:57.372 --> 02:59.705
How great is that?

02:59.707 --> 03:01.907
Uh, yeah.

03:01.909 --> 03:03.709
What?

03:03.711 --> 03:05.711
Nothing.

03:05.713 --> 03:08.464
Oh, come on, Leonard, I know
the car was a thoughtful gesture

03:08.466 --> 03:09.715
and I really appreciate it,

03:09.717 --> 03:11.550
but it doesn't make sense
to have both.

03:11.552 --> 03:13.469
You're right.
What should I have done?

03:13.471 --> 03:16.922
Taken a picture of us in the car
and put it in a pink frame

03:16.924 --> 03:21.277
with puffy paint around it
that says “best fiancé ever”?

03:22.730 --> 03:24.930
Doesn't sound that bad.

03:24.932 --> 03:27.266
Well, good, because...
that's why I did!

03:27.268 --> 03:28.517
Aw...

03:29.854 --> 03:31.387
Oh...

03:31.389 --> 03:32.438
thank you.

03:32.440 --> 03:33.989
That-that is so sweet.
No, it's not

03:33.991 --> 03:35.775
that sweet--
I paid for the frame

03:35.777 --> 03:38.027
with your money
and then got a massage.

03:38.029 --> 03:41.447
You know what, you don't
have to give me this.

03:41.449 --> 03:42.748
You keep it.

03:42.750 --> 03:43.949
Why?
The car

03:43.951 --> 03:45.568
was a gift-- it was something
you needed.

03:45.570 --> 03:47.002
I was happy to
help you out.

03:47.004 --> 03:49.839
And I really appreciate it,
but now I <i> don't</i> need it,

03:49.841 --> 03:52.091
so... here you go.
Well,

03:52.093 --> 03:53.876
this is silly-- so you
don't need the car,

03:53.878 --> 03:55.761
but you could use it to buy
yourself something else,

03:55.763 --> 03:59.999
like a... new purse to
put all this money in.

04:00.001 --> 04:01.384
Sweetie, I can buy my own stuff.

04:01.386 --> 04:02.768
I have a good job now.

04:02.770 --> 04:04.236
I know, and I'm
proud of you,

04:04.238 --> 04:06.105
but that doesn't mean I
can't do something nice.

04:06.107 --> 04:09.108
Like this.

04:09.110 --> 04:11.143
Okay, I don't want this
to turn into a fight.

04:11.145 --> 04:12.278
I don't, either.
Great.

04:12.280 --> 04:14.230
Thank you.

04:16.868 --> 04:18.983
Can you pass the salt, please?
Sure.

04:25.076 --> 04:28.110
In my mind, that broke
the tension with comedy

04:28.112 --> 04:30.079
and led to sex.

04:35.169 --> 04:37.286
Hey, Sheldon, you busy?

04:37.288 --> 04:39.171
I'm always busy.

04:39.173 --> 04:42.508
This mind is capable
of advanced multitasking.

04:42.510 --> 04:43.476
You know, currently,

04:43.478 --> 04:44.810
I'm attempting to solve

04:44.812 --> 04:46.011
the Penrose conjecture,

04:46.013 --> 04:48.647
I'm composing
my Nobel acceptance speech

04:48.649 --> 04:51.150
for when I've solved
the Penrose conjecture,

04:51.152 --> 04:54.370
and I'm wondering
how mermaids have babies.

04:55.640 --> 04:58.357
Don't they lay eggs on a rock?

04:59.577 --> 05:01.994
Now I've got room
for another thing.

05:01.996 --> 05:03.446
What do you want?

05:03.448 --> 05:06.165
So, I did a little
research on what

05:06.167 --> 05:08.000
the conditions are like
in the mines,

05:08.002 --> 05:09.502
and the guys might be right--

05:09.504 --> 05:10.870
sounds pretty rough
down there.

05:10.872 --> 05:12.838
For starters, it's very humid,

05:12.840 --> 05:14.623
and about a hundred degrees.

05:14.625 --> 05:17.460
Well, I'm from Texas
and you're from India--

05:17.462 --> 05:21.597
we're no strangers
to the fragrant armpit. Next.

05:21.599 --> 05:25.284
It's also a live mine, so
there'll be dynamite explosions

05:25.286 --> 05:27.553
going off in the distance.
Yeah, I have

05:27.555 --> 05:29.388
a lactose-intolerant roommate

05:29.390 --> 05:32.441
with a taste
for ice cream. Next.

05:32.443 --> 05:35.394
Oh, you have to be down there
for 12 hours at a time.

05:35.396 --> 05:38.147
Yeah? We have to be somewhere.

05:38.149 --> 05:39.315
Well, there's no toilets--

05:39.317 --> 05:41.066
we'll have to do our business
in a bucket.

05:41.068 --> 05:44.153
So it's settled--
we're not doing it.

05:45.740 --> 05:48.374
Look, I get it, but...
before we pass up

05:48.376 --> 05:51.026
on an incredible opportunity,
I was thinking about

05:51.028 --> 05:53.212
when Howard was training
to go to space,

05:53.214 --> 05:55.164
they put him
in a simulated environment.

05:55.166 --> 05:58.467
Interesting. You're
suggesting that we recreate

05:58.469 --> 06:00.302
the conditions
of the mine

06:00.304 --> 06:02.721
to see if we can handle it.
Exactly.

06:02.723 --> 06:04.757
Very well.
So where should we do it?

06:04.759 --> 06:08.093
Well, I'll just Google
“hot, dark and moist,”

06:08.095 --> 06:11.263
see what comes up.

06:12.099 --> 06:13.482
Uh, Sheldon...

06:13.484 --> 06:16.452
Oh, there, well, look,
there's all kinds of videos.

06:20.074 --> 06:21.440
Hey, you got a sec?

06:21.442 --> 06:22.775
Hi. Sure.

06:22.777 --> 06:24.493
I was hoping we could talk
about the money again.

06:24.495 --> 06:27.279
Oh, sweetie, just forget about it.
No, no, no, no,

06:27.281 --> 06:29.949
hear me out. I know things
got a little weird last night.

06:29.951 --> 06:33.202
Well, leaving an envelope full
of cash on my dresser after sex

06:33.204 --> 06:35.838
would count as weird.

06:35.840 --> 06:39.208
Well, I think I came up
with a pretty good solution.

06:39.210 --> 06:39.916
Mm.

06:39.940 --> 06:42.070
Why don't we just put the money
in a joint account?

06:42.179 --> 06:43.846
It'll be our first
money together.

06:43.848 --> 06:46.098
We can use it for the wedding,
the honeymoon, whatever.

06:46.100 --> 06:48.050
You know what, that's great.
I love that!

06:48.052 --> 06:51.937
Yeah, of course you do--
I'm not just a genius in bed.

06:59.146 --> 07:02.481
You sure are, baby.

07:03.317 --> 07:05.818
You two want to be alone?

07:05.820 --> 07:08.704
I want you to know I get
why you don't want the money--

07:08.706 --> 07:10.406
you've got this new job,
you're excited

07:10.408 --> 07:12.074
about being financially
independent--

07:12.076 --> 07:14.126
and I am nothing
but proud of you.

07:14.128 --> 07:15.494
Oh, thank you so much.

07:15.496 --> 07:17.580
It feels so good
to hear you say that.

07:17.582 --> 07:18.797
And I want you
to know

07:18.799 --> 07:20.666
that I get this job
kind of changes

07:20.668 --> 07:22.167
the balance in our relationship,

07:22.169 --> 07:24.587
and... I'm trying
to be sensitive to that.

07:26.591 --> 07:29.008
What?

07:29.010 --> 07:31.510
Well, I just think that
maybe you're a little hung up

07:31.512 --> 07:34.063
on the money because
I'm less reliant on you now,

07:34.065 --> 07:35.514
and that's a little scary.

07:36.350 --> 07:38.684
Hmm.

07:38.686 --> 07:40.369
Maybe.

07:41.522 --> 07:44.690
<i>Or</i> maybe I tried
to do something nice

07:44.692 --> 07:47.159
and maybe you had
a problem with it

07:47.161 --> 07:49.878
because of your control issues.

07:51.382 --> 07:53.282
Control issues?

07:53.284 --> 07:56.035
Maybe.

07:56.037 --> 07:58.337
<i>Or...</i> maybe...

07:58.339 --> 08:00.539
now that I'm no longer
an out-of-work actress

08:00.541 --> 08:02.591
who can't pay
for her own dinner,

08:02.593 --> 08:04.710
that makes you
a little insecure.

08:04.712 --> 08:06.312
Well, I can't believe
you'd say that.

08:06.314 --> 08:10.065
You know how insecure I am
about my insecurities.

08:11.552 --> 08:13.135
You know what?
I'm sorry.

08:13.137 --> 08:14.970
It's stupid
to fight over money.

08:14.972 --> 08:17.039
Yeah, I'm sorry, too.
We're about to share

08:17.041 --> 08:18.474
the rest of our lives together.

08:18.476 --> 08:20.776
It's <i> our</i> money--
who cares who has it?

08:20.778 --> 08:23.646
Ugh! You're right--
who cares? Mm.

08:24.482 --> 08:26.615
Get that money
out of my back pocket

08:26.617 --> 08:28.984
or I will break your fingers.

08:31.072 --> 08:33.072
Huh. All this time
I never knew

08:33.073 --> 08:34.740
there were steam tunnels
down here.

08:34.741 --> 08:36.625
Most universities
have them.

08:36.626 --> 08:39.410
When I was an undergrad,
I spent three days in one

08:39.413 --> 08:40.828
pledging a sorority.

08:41.716 --> 08:43.732
Did you get in?

08:43.734 --> 08:45.250
No. They forgot I was there.

08:45.252 --> 08:47.720
But it really opened up
my pores.

08:49.006 --> 08:50.589
Well, according
to my research,

08:50.591 --> 08:53.559
the steam tunnels
below this access point

08:53.561 --> 08:56.812
should be the closest
analog to the mines.

08:56.814 --> 08:58.230
This is gonna be
so much more accurate

08:58.232 --> 08:59.348
than the steam room at the gym.

08:59.350 --> 09:00.599
Plus, there's almost no chance

09:00.601 --> 09:03.318
we'll see any
of our coworkers half naked.

09:03.320 --> 09:06.572
Or totally naked.
I love Howard,

09:06.574 --> 09:08.691
but the dude needs
a little shame.

09:08.693 --> 09:12.111
All right, Amy, this
walkie-talkie is yours.

09:12.113 --> 09:14.613
If we run into any problems,
I'll contact you.

09:14.615 --> 09:16.782
And if anything bad happens,
what's the rule?

09:16.784 --> 09:20.369
Save you first; come back
for Raj only if there's time.

09:20.371 --> 09:22.955
We're going
to be fine.

09:22.957 --> 09:24.957
Sheldon, I'm really impressed

09:24.959 --> 09:26.709
you're willing to try this.

09:26.711 --> 09:28.460
Well, admittedly,
this brushes up

09:28.462 --> 09:31.847
against my well-known aversions
to heat, small places,

09:31.849 --> 09:33.432
going below floor-level,

09:33.434 --> 09:35.801
dampness, hatches,
ladders,

09:35.803 --> 09:37.686
darkness, echoes,

09:37.688 --> 09:41.106
and eliminating in
Home Depot buckets.

09:41.108 --> 09:43.809
That last one is quite new,
but I have a feeling

09:43.811 --> 09:46.228
that's gonna rocket
to the top of the list.

09:48.000 --> 09:54.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

09:59.096 --> 10:03.015
I'm sweating already.

10:03.017 --> 10:08.103
Yeah, as the person beneath you,
allow me to say, I know.

10:11.142 --> 10:12.975
How hot is it?

10:12.977 --> 10:15.644
Uh, let's see.
704?

10:15.646 --> 10:18.063
No, wait, it's on “clock.”

10:18.065 --> 10:20.482
No, the real answer
isn't much better.

10:20.484 --> 10:22.651
102 degrees.

10:22.653 --> 10:23.986
Well, that's what we wanted.

10:23.988 --> 10:25.701
This is as hot
as the mines will be.

10:25.725 --> 10:26.741
True.

10:26.741 --> 10:31.827
Sheldon's Mine Simulation Log,
entry one.

10:31.829 --> 10:34.496
Koothrappali's restating
of the obvious

10:34.498 --> 10:37.249
is already getting on my nerves.

10:39.670 --> 10:41.303
Thanks again
for having us.

10:41.305 --> 10:43.973
Oh, of course. What did
you guys want to talk about?

10:43.975 --> 10:45.975
Well, you know, now
that we're engaged,

10:45.977 --> 10:49.478
we had some questions about how
you handle money as a couple.

10:49.480 --> 10:53.015
I told you they weren't gonna
ask us to swing with them.

10:55.186 --> 10:56.518
I didn't think
they were going to.

10:56.520 --> 10:58.103
I just wanted to have
a way to say no

10:58.105 --> 11:00.155
without hurting
Leonard's feelings.

11:01.192 --> 11:04.026
Well... nailed it.

11:04.028 --> 11:05.527
So what did you
want to know?

11:05.529 --> 11:08.580
Well, do you guys ever
fight over money?

11:08.582 --> 11:10.082
Sure, sometimes.

11:10.084 --> 11:11.250
I mean, it can be
a little awkward

11:11.252 --> 11:13.869
since I make so much more money
than Howie.

11:14.755 --> 11:17.956
You didn't have to say
“so much more.”

11:17.958 --> 11:19.541
Well, I didn't have to,
but for the sake of accuracy

11:19.543 --> 11:21.677
I felt that I should.

11:22.513 --> 11:24.179
I brought a lot of
significant assets

11:24.181 --> 11:25.748
into the
relationship, too.

11:25.750 --> 11:29.885
Like what? Your incomplete set
of <i> Star Trek</i> collector plates?

11:30.988 --> 11:32.204
For your information,
I just bought the last one

11:32.206 --> 11:34.523
I needed on eBay.

11:34.525 --> 11:36.208
Without asking me?

11:36.210 --> 11:39.294
There were only three minutes
left in the auction

11:39.296 --> 11:43.649
and it was a mint condition
Scotty from a smoke-free home.

11:45.903 --> 11:46.869
How much, Howie?

11:46.871 --> 11:47.820
Not a lot.

11:47.822 --> 11:49.722
How much?

11:49.724 --> 11:52.908
Let's not talk about this
in front of our friends.

11:52.910 --> 11:56.412
Was it more or less
than falconry school?

11:58.165 --> 12:02.768
For the tenth time,
that was a Groupon.

12:03.587 --> 12:05.771
Like I would swing
with him.

12:10.261 --> 12:12.144
How you feeling?

12:12.146 --> 12:13.579
Good.

12:13.581 --> 12:16.432
Little claustrophobic.

12:16.434 --> 12:17.816
Let's set up
the equipment.

12:17.818 --> 12:20.102
It'll help take
your mind off of it.

12:20.104 --> 12:24.156
Miners often sang mining songs
to keep their spirits up.

12:24.158 --> 12:25.908
Do you know any
mining songs?

12:25.910 --> 12:27.943
Just the hits.

12:27.945 --> 12:31.613
♪ Where it's dark
as a dungeon ♪

12:31.615 --> 12:34.032
♪ And it's damp
as the dew ♪

12:34.034 --> 12:35.117
That's pretty.

12:35.119 --> 12:37.453
♪ Where the dangers
are double ♪

12:37.455 --> 12:40.589
♪ And the pleasures
are few ♪

12:40.591 --> 12:43.342
♪ Where the rain never falls ♪

12:43.344 --> 12:46.044
♪ And the sun never shines ♪

12:46.046 --> 12:48.964
♪ Yes, it's dark as a dungeon ♪

12:48.966 --> 12:50.966
♪ Way down
in the mine ♪

12:50.968 --> 12:53.135
It's a little more
bleak than I thought.

12:53.137 --> 12:55.721
♪ Well, I pray
when I dead ♪

12:55.723 --> 12:58.524
♪ And the ages shall roll ♪

12:58.526 --> 13:01.193
♪ That my body will blacken ♪

13:01.195 --> 13:03.695

13:03.697 --> 13:07.032

of grim.

13:07.034 --> 13:09.535

from the door ♪

13:09.537 --> 13:12.654

13:12.656 --> 13:15.040
♪ And pity the miner ♪

13:15.042 --> 13:18.577

13:20.331 --> 13:24.633
Okay. How 'bout
a little Miley Cyrus next?

13:24.635 --> 13:26.301
Who's he?

13:30.007 --> 13:32.224
Talk about wasted money.

13:32.226 --> 13:34.560
What about the late fees
on our credit card

13:34.562 --> 13:36.261
because somebody didn't pay
the bill on time?

13:36.263 --> 13:37.563
Well, maybe I would have paid it

13:37.565 --> 13:40.098
if I wasn't also doing
everything else around here.

13:40.100 --> 13:42.317
Oh, you're saying I don't do
anything around here.

13:44.104 --> 13:47.406
Look at my chore chart.

13:47.408 --> 13:50.859
She made him a chore chart.
I see it.

13:50.861 --> 13:54.363
“Do the dishes.”
There's a star right there.

13:54.365 --> 13:57.366
That was a pity star. Putting
water in the roasting pan

13:57.368 --> 14:00.335
and leaving it in the sink
is not doing the dishes.

14:00.337 --> 14:04.540
That pan had to soak
and you know it.

14:04.542 --> 14:06.625
Well, don't come crying to me

14:06.627 --> 14:08.343
when you don't get
your allowance.

14:09.213 --> 14:10.262
It's not an allowance.

14:10.264 --> 14:11.547
It's a stipend!

14:11.549 --> 14:13.465
And we said we weren't gonna
call it an allowance

14:13.467 --> 14:14.800
in front of my friends.

14:18.889 --> 14:21.723
I usually don't like
lemon bars,

14:21.725 --> 14:24.226
but Th-these are really good.

14:26.363 --> 14:30.232
So, as Hannah
Montana, Miley

14:30.234 --> 14:31.817
was a world-famous pop star.

14:31.819 --> 14:33.819
But then she would take off
her wig and go to school

14:33.821 --> 14:35.037
like a
normal girl.

14:35.039 --> 14:36.071
Which, I don't have to tell you,

14:36.073 --> 14:39.074
at that age,
is its own headache.

14:39.076 --> 14:41.376
That's preposterous.

14:41.378 --> 14:44.496
How would she go unrecognized
just by wearing a wig?

14:44.498 --> 14:46.582
But you're okay with Superman
concealing his identity

14:46.584 --> 14:47.833
with a pair of glasses?

14:47.835 --> 14:49.751
He doesn't just put on a pair
of glasses.

14:49.753 --> 14:51.386
He combs back his curlicue

14:51.388 --> 14:54.556
and affects
a mild-mannered personality.

14:54.558 --> 14:56.925
You guys doing
okay down there?

14:56.927 --> 14:59.978
I told you to use
the walkie-talkie!

14:59.980 --> 15:04.433
You guys doing okay down there?

15:04.435 --> 15:09.021
Please keep this channel clear
for emergencies. Thank you.

15:09.023 --> 15:12.741
I'm going to the vending
machine. Do you want anything?

15:12.743 --> 15:15.360
This is a simulation.
We have to survive

15:15.362 --> 15:16.695
on the supplies we brought.

15:16.697 --> 15:19.281
Okay, just checking.

15:19.283 --> 15:22.251
We should have asked her
to get some Funyuns.

15:22.253 --> 15:24.169
You're not going to have Funyuns

15:24.171 --> 15:26.505
when we're a mile
below the surface of the Earth.

15:26.507 --> 15:28.290
What if we brought them down
with us?

15:29.126 --> 15:31.793
We'll take some Funyuns.

15:31.795 --> 15:33.795
Anything else?

15:33.797 --> 15:36.465
Some York Peppermint Patties,

15:36.467 --> 15:38.133
a couple
of Dr. Peppers, and...

15:38.135 --> 15:40.886
run to Best Buy and see if
they have a portable DVD player

15:40.888 --> 15:44.523
and season one of a show
called <i> Hannah Montana.</i>

15:44.525 --> 15:46.892
Have her get season two.

15:46.894 --> 15:49.811
Season one,
it was still finding itself.

15:50.898 --> 15:53.315
Sorry you guys had to see that.
Oh,

15:53.317 --> 15:54.650
don't apologize.
Yeah.

15:54.652 --> 15:58.036
It just makes it a lot harder
to pretend it never happened.

15:58.038 --> 16:00.155
Money's a sensitive subject
for Howie

16:00.157 --> 16:02.124
because of the difference
in our income.

16:02.126 --> 16:03.375
It really bothers him?

16:03.377 --> 16:04.626
Well, sure.
There's still a lot of pressure

16:04.628 --> 16:05.994
on guys to be providers.

16:05.996 --> 16:07.963
So even though
he's happy for me,

16:07.965 --> 16:09.765
it's just a little tough on him.

16:09.767 --> 16:11.466
Uh-oh.
What?

16:11.468 --> 16:12.668
Well,

16:12.670 --> 16:13.835
if I do well in sales,

16:13.837 --> 16:15.671
I could end up making a
lot more money than you.

16:15.673 --> 16:17.673
Not a problem.
I grew up with a mother

16:17.675 --> 16:19.341
who emasculated
my father financially

16:19.343 --> 16:21.760
and in every other aspect
of his life, so...

16:23.030 --> 16:26.181
...really, it's what I think
love looks like.

16:27.618 --> 16:29.985
I'll be right back.
I'm gonna go check on him.

16:32.239 --> 16:33.893
Maybe it's a good
thing we came here.

16:33.894 --> 16:35.930
It's like a lesson
in what not to do.

16:35.931 --> 16:38.694
Yeah I don't want something dumb
like money to come between us.

16:38.696 --> 16:40.862
It won't. Let's just promise
to figure this kind of stuff out

16:40.864 --> 16:41.947
before we get married.

16:41.949 --> 16:44.333
Why are you
being so bossy?!

16:44.335 --> 16:46.234
Why are you
being a baby?

16:46.236 --> 16:48.837
I'm not a baby!
I'm a grown man,

16:48.839 --> 16:52.374
and I made the bed.
Now where's my star?

16:54.561 --> 16:56.595
Should we go?
Hang on.

16:56.597 --> 16:59.348
I want to see if
he gets the star.

17:01.518 --> 17:04.603
Oh, this heat is brutal.

17:04.605 --> 17:07.105
As someone from the tropical
subcontinent of India,

17:07.107 --> 17:09.608
you should know that fanning
yourself in a humid environment

17:09.609 --> 17:12.144
only raises
your body temperature.

17:12.146 --> 17:15.113
Huh. That does explain why
the servants used to look so hot

17:15.115 --> 17:16.865
while they were fanning me.

17:16.867 --> 17:20.618
Let's get our minds off
how uncomfortable we are.

17:20.621 --> 17:22.954
We could take some more
simulated instrument readings.

17:22.955 --> 17:24.239
My major focus

17:24.241 --> 17:26.958
at the moment is keeping
my claustrophobia at bay.

17:26.960 --> 17:28.542
How's that going?
You tell me.

17:28.545 --> 17:30.412
I feel like I can't breathe,

17:30.414 --> 17:33.081
and I am tempted
to crack you open

17:33.083 --> 17:36.051
and suck the air
right out of your lungs.

17:36.970 --> 17:39.638
Sheldon, if this is
too much, we can stop.

17:39.640 --> 17:40.722
We're not stopping.

17:40.724 --> 17:42.507
You don't have to
bite my head off.

17:42.509 --> 17:44.092
I apologize.

17:44.094 --> 17:45.477
I j...

17:45.479 --> 17:48.397
I'm plagued
by an internal struggle.

17:48.399 --> 17:50.098
If you would just use
the bucket,

17:50.100 --> 17:52.567
you'd be
so much more comfortable.

17:52.569 --> 17:55.687
My struggle is emotional.

17:55.689 --> 17:57.439
Oh. Is it Amy?

17:57.441 --> 17:59.608
It's dark matter.

17:59.610 --> 18:01.843
When I entered
the field

18:01.845 --> 18:04.279
of string theory,
I was a prodigy.

18:04.281 --> 18:08.366
I rose to a position of respect,

18:08.368 --> 18:10.752
and I assumed
my career would continue

18:10.754 --> 18:12.821
on that upward trajectory.

18:12.823 --> 18:15.624
Now here I am in my 30s,

18:15.626 --> 18:18.627
I'm back at square one.

18:18.629 --> 18:22.147
And, frankly, it's frightening.

18:23.250 --> 18:26.601
Sheldon, you know
what I think of when I'm scared?

18:26.603 --> 18:27.969
<i>Voyager.</i>

18:27.971 --> 18:30.188
<i>Voyager</i> the space probe

18:30.190 --> 18:33.975
or <i> Voyager</i>
the <i> Star Trek</i> TV show?

18:33.977 --> 18:35.444
The space probe.

18:35.446 --> 18:37.062
Good.
Because I am too hot and tired

18:37.064 --> 18:40.315
to go on about how much
I hate <i> Voyager</i> the TV show.

18:41.535 --> 18:43.318
By the time
I was born,

18:43.320 --> 18:45.737
<i>Voyager 1's</i> mission
was supposed to be over.

18:45.739 --> 18:46.872
It had seen

18:46.874 --> 18:49.958
Jupiter and Saturn
and all their moons,

18:49.960 --> 18:52.327
but it kept going.

18:53.497 --> 18:55.130
When I left India for America,

18:55.132 --> 18:57.799
I was never more scared
in my life.

18:57.801 --> 19:00.168
I had no idea
what lay ahead.

19:00.170 --> 19:02.938
Whenever I feel that way,
I think about how...

19:02.940 --> 19:06.842
<i>Voyager</i> is still out there

19:06.844 --> 19:09.478
somewhere
beyond our solar system,

19:09.480 --> 19:12.347
going further than anyone
ever thought it could.

19:15.652 --> 19:18.436
Don't leave!
You can do this!

19:20.274 --> 19:22.324
Sheldon,
is everything okay?

19:22.326 --> 19:23.859
It's too late for Koothrappali.

19:23.861 --> 19:24.876
Let's go!

19:27.331 --> 19:31.199
11 minutes.
That's longer than I thought.

19:32.035 --> 19:33.502
They're in my shirt!

19:44.484 --> 19:46.818
Okay, this is definitely
the most fun thing we can do

19:46.820 --> 19:47.986
with the money.

19:50.824 --> 19:54.943
I've never done it on
a big old pile of cash before.

19:56.947 --> 20:01.533
“Me neither, Leonard.
It's my first time, too.”

20:05.005 --> 20:08.123
I'm so sorry I made you feel bad
about the money stuff.

20:08.125 --> 20:11.309
It's okay.
No, it's not okay.

20:11.311 --> 20:13.628
I want us to be
partners, equals.

20:13.630 --> 20:16.381
Adults in a mature
relationship.

20:16.383 --> 20:18.550
I want that, too.

20:19.937 --> 20:22.137
Now, let's talk about
your birthday party.

20:22.139 --> 20:24.639
Ooh, laser tag, laser tag.
Oh!
