00:27.630 --> 00:28.283
Kleenex.

00:29.559 --> 00:30.906
I'm gonna miss Stan.

00:31.013 --> 00:32.472
I know, I'm gonna miss him too.

00:32.646 --> 00:36.087
He was so cute, with his fedora and his Hush Puppies.

00:36.190 --> 00:38.483
Everyday, the fedora and the Hush Puppies.

00:38.606 --> 00:40.567
Yeah, if he just would have added some pants.

00:40.772 --> 00:41.402
Mom!

00:41.545 --> 00:42.958
I'm sorry, I'm just trying to lighten the mood.

00:43.045 --> 00:44.534
'Cause you wouldn't want a downer funeral.

00:44.657 --> 00:46.235
Ok, we're being serious now.

00:46.875 --> 00:48.303
You remember every Tuesday,

00:48.422 --> 00:50.336
Stan came to the Independence Inn for lunch?

00:50.460 --> 00:51.236
I remember.

00:51.391 --> 00:53.249
That was a total waste because he couldn't eat dairy,

00:53.398 --> 00:55.232
or salt, or meat,

00:55.461 --> 00:57.806
so he basically just came in every week for a salad,

00:57.975 --> 00:59.997
with no oil, and no mushrooms.

01:00.141 --> 01:03.249
- He hated mushrooms. 
- I hate mushrooms too.

01:03.398 --> 01:04.635
Oh, here you go.

01:05.911 --> 01:10.498
You know, he called last week and made the first lunch reservation at the Dragonfly.

01:10.785 --> 01:12.926
- He did? 
- Don't cancel it.

01:13.110 --> 01:15.608
No, of course not. We'll save a seat for Stan.

01:15.913 --> 01:17.175
Save him a seat...

01:20.934 --> 01:24.230
You'll find The Mourners' Kaddish on page 453.

01:24.528 --> 01:29.602
"May his illustrious name become increasingly great and holy...

01:29.771 --> 01:32.602
Hey, did you ever notice that in Stars Hollow death comes in fives?

01:32.833 --> 01:34.414
Do not try to lighten the mood!

01:34.604 --> 01:35.627
I'm not, it's true!

01:35.961 --> 01:36.703
It is?

01:36.826 --> 01:39.657
Yeah, last year: Chester Thompson, Sarah Merrymen,

01:39.821 --> 01:41.926
- Fran, and the Dublin twins. 
- That's right.

01:42.025 --> 01:46.763
Yeah, year before: Chuck O'Mishner, Santos Perez Jr, Santos Perez Sr -

01:46.935 --> 01:49.869
...Perry Lewis and Charlie Slater, you're right!

01:49.967 --> 01:52.831
And now, Pinochle Downs, Mr. Angelotopolous -

01:53.062 --> 01:54.977
- Mrs. Krenz! 
- And Stan.

01:55.883 --> 01:57.987
Wait a minute, that's only four.

01:58.125 --> 01:59.391
It is only four.

01:59.994 --> 02:01.941
That means the fifth hasn't happened yet.

02:02.078 --> 02:03.799
Blessed, praised,

02:04.131 --> 02:06.230
glorified, exalted -

02:06.358 --> 02:08.791
Number five could be in this room right now.

02:09.092 --> 02:10.327
Oh, no.

02:10.833 --> 02:12.360
- What? 
- Hank Krutzman!

02:12.519 --> 02:14.443
- Hank Krutzman? 
- Why would it be Hank Krutzman?

02:14.643 --> 02:16.240
Because he's 110!

02:16.444 --> 02:18.457
- Hank's 110? 
- No.

02:19.435 --> 02:20.417
Why would you say that?

02:20.552 --> 02:22.507
Because, that's the age you say when someone is really old.

02:22.718 --> 02:24.304
- I don't. 
- What age do you say?

02:24.433 --> 02:28.124
I say the age they are, otherwise I would seem cruel and insensitive.

02:28.304 --> 02:31.063
Fine, the point is he is very, very old.

02:31.370 --> 02:33.075
That doesn't make him number five.

02:33.244 --> 02:34.304
I don't know...

02:34.743 --> 02:37.657
Hank Krutzman. He was such a happy guy.

02:37.878 --> 02:39.024
He had such a good life.

02:39.367 --> 02:40.632
He owned those horses.

02:40.843 --> 02:41.948
He loved his golf.

02:42.142 --> 02:43.094
- Stop! 
- What?

02:43.356 --> 02:45.906
You guys just eulogized Hank! He's not even dead yet.

02:46.106 --> 02:49.516
At this time, I would like to call up Stan's dear friend

02:49.638 --> 02:52.244
and fellow Rotary Club member, Reverand Skinner.

02:53.939 --> 02:55.670
Ok, but if we do think it's Hank -

02:55.798 --> 02:57.554
- We don't think it's Hank. 
- Why not?

02:57.774 --> 02:59.965
Because if we think it's Hank, and then something happens

03:00.032 --> 03:02.453
and it turns out to be Hank, then we caused it.

03:02.561 --> 03:03.642
She's right.

03:03.914 --> 03:04.900
It's not Hank.

03:05.121 --> 03:08.009
So now, let's just focus on Stan because he's dead,

03:08.111 --> 03:09.883
and we had nothing to do with that.

03:10.031 --> 03:11.021
- Fine. 
- Right.

03:11.173 --> 03:13.734
My good friend Stan Green lived here for 56 years.

03:14.159 --> 03:16.129
He loved this town and it's friendly people,

03:16.277 --> 03:18.582
charming stores and beautiful church bells.

03:18.818 --> 03:21.030
Now, many of you don't remember the church bells.

03:21.125 --> 03:24.577
They fell into disrepair about 20 years ago and have been quiet ever since.

03:24.798 --> 03:26.431
But Stan remembered those bells,

03:26.683 --> 03:30.477
and it was his wish that they ring out over Stars Hollow once again,

03:30.655 --> 03:34.265
so he generously bequeathed the funds to make that dream come true.

03:36.482 --> 03:39.620
We're going to restore the bells in honor of our dear friend Stan,

03:39.841 --> 03:42.129
and every time they ring we'll think of him.

03:42.364 --> 03:44.284
He will be missed, but never forgotten.

03:44.633 --> 03:45.626
Oh, Stan.

03:46.046 --> 03:46.855
Thank you, Reverend.

03:47.818 --> 03:51.611
Now, please join us in saying goodbye at the cemetery.

03:55.293 --> 03:56.200
That's so sweet.

03:56.348 --> 03:57.484
Yeah, do you remember the bells?

03:57.632 --> 04:00.039
- No, it was before my time. 
- Me too, sounds great.

04:00.510 --> 04:01.857
Oh, they were fantastic.

04:02.015 --> 04:04.590
One of my most romantic memories happened during those bells.

04:04.750 --> 04:05.978
Your first kiss?

04:06.168 --> 04:08.112
Sure. Oh-kay.

04:09.741 --> 04:11.150
- Oh, no! 
- Hank!

04:11.913 --> 04:13.299
Okay. He's okay, he's okay.

04:13.546 --> 04:14.565
Oh, thank god.

04:15.491 --> 04:17.595
We are going to be very stressed out for the rest of Hank's life.

04:17.796 --> 04:19.639
Serves us right for making him the fifth.

04:19.767 --> 04:22.337
Hey, we did not make him the fifth, we do not have the power.

04:22.506 --> 04:23.510
We just speculated.

04:23.683 --> 04:25.526
Yeah, that was it, for all we know anyone could be the fifth.

04:25.722 --> 04:27.692
That's right, it could be anyone. I mean Taylor,

04:27.775 --> 04:29.577
or Reggie, or Andrew or Kirk.

04:29.828 --> 04:32.489
Oh! Going dark, going dark!

04:35.011 --> 04:37.140
We are the Witches of Eastwick.

05:49.004 --> 05:50.740
- Yeah! 
- Perfect.

05:50.853 --> 05:53.148
That middle-A drum roll was awesome!

05:53.264 --> 05:54.442
- So keep it? 
- Keep it!

05:54.775 --> 05:56.497
Zack, you seem less than thrilled?

05:56.628 --> 05:59.418
Yeah man, you look like my seven year old when she's all grumpy-puss.

05:59.576 --> 06:01.605
Look, far be it from me to complain -

06:01.753 --> 06:03.320
- Since when? 
- Don't be a putz.

06:03.545 --> 06:04.619
But you complain a lot.

06:05.245 --> 06:07.437
I just think we're a little too on the beat, that's all.

06:07.606 --> 06:08.900
Too on the beat. That's crazy.

06:09.029 --> 06:10.278
How can we be too on the beat?

06:10.416 --> 06:11.497
We should be off the beat?

06:11.630 --> 06:12.945
Hey, fine, sorry I brought it up.

06:13.109 --> 06:15.726
Let's just play perfectly on the beat and add a laser show

06:15.864 --> 06:17.958
and a flute and be "prog" rock, if that's what you want.

06:18.080 --> 06:19.597
We're just trying to figure out what you mean, Zack.

06:19.704 --> 06:21.420
- So, we're too perfect? 
- I think.

06:21.579 --> 06:23.446
Are we practicing too much?

06:23.575 --> 06:24.973
We don't practice too much, we're just good.

06:25.079 --> 06:27.230
I don't want to sound all fake and computerized, alright?

06:27.337 --> 06:28.967
I don't wanna be N*Sync.

06:29.177 --> 06:30.732
N*Sync, what's that?

06:30.895 --> 06:32.480
N*Sync is one of those sucky boy-bands.

06:32.612 --> 06:35.470
Oh, I'm rock and roll, I don't know anything about boy-bands.

06:35.612 --> 06:37.522
I don't either, I've just read about them.

06:37.942 --> 06:39.032
You read about N*Sync?

06:39.151 --> 06:40.871
What are they, like a guilty pleasure for you or something?

06:41.004 --> 06:42.894
Hey, if we're getting confessional and all,

06:43.364 --> 06:45.524
I kinda like Simon and Garfunkel.

06:45.689 --> 06:48.366
I've always had this thing for Fleetwood Mac, I'm embarrassed to say.

06:48.494 --> 06:49.529
Sarah McLachlan.

06:50.010 --> 06:51.003
So, N*Sync?

06:51.239 --> 06:54.157
I'm not into N*Sync!. I just read a lot about music,

06:54.261 --> 06:57.133
and I've read about them, and I don't read, I skim!

06:57.299 --> 06:59.942
Hey, as far as the beat goes, we can loosen things up a bit.

07:00.246 --> 07:02.994
- I mean, I know I can. 
- That's all I'm saying.

07:03.122 --> 07:05.806
A little more Stones, a little less Kraftwerk.

07:06.035 --> 07:08.227
Well, are we takin' a break now? I gotta make a call.

07:08.362 --> 07:09.573
Yeah, let's take a break.

07:13.307 --> 07:15.181
- You're so mean to him. 
- No, I'm not.

07:15.528 --> 07:17.986
He knows exactly who you're talking about, and he's so nice.

07:18.160 --> 07:21.242
Yeah, I mean he gets here early, he brings sandwiches from his shop.

07:21.720 --> 07:25.139
Never an Italian sub with pickles, which is what I like, I must say.

07:25.282 --> 07:27.878
I would rather you gave me the hard time instead of Gil,

07:27.971 --> 07:29.021
since I'm the one who let him in the band.

07:29.151 --> 07:33.022
Hey, we all let him in, we're a democracy, we all let him in the band.

07:33.121 --> 07:36.239
Fine, we all let him in, so we should all remember that.

07:36.388 --> 07:39.260
You guys are not going to believe this, not in a million years.

07:39.470 --> 07:40.760
Xander win a soccer match?

07:40.820 --> 07:42.481
No, that's at 4:00 tomorrow.

07:42.578 --> 07:45.379
We, the band, are booked...

07:45.450 --> 07:47.478
- at CBGB's. 
- We're what?

07:47.637 --> 07:48.942
Dude, we have a gig at CBGB's.

07:49.357 --> 07:51.052
CBGB's in New York?

07:51.200 --> 07:52.691
No, in Hackensack.

07:52.977 --> 07:54.754
Joke, dudes, the one in New York.

07:55.122 --> 07:57.316
- Oh My God! 
- Gil, come on, are you serious?

07:57.540 --> 08:00.299
Dude, I am always serious about rock and roll.

08:00.462 --> 08:01.362
How did this happen?

08:01.486 --> 08:03.032
My buddy Pete works sound there?

08:03.329 --> 08:06.360
I got him a tape, he slipped it to the booker, and BAM, we're in.

08:06.871 --> 08:09.078
- Holy bam! 
- I need my inhaler.

08:09.197 --> 08:12.206
Now, it's not a great slot; It's 1:00 on a Tuesday night.

08:12.698 --> 08:14.956
Who cares? It's CBGB's!

08:15.075 --> 08:16.513
The Ramones started there!

08:17.127 --> 08:20.232
Blondie, Sonic Youth, Television, Talking Heads... the list goes on and on.

08:20.641 --> 08:23.482
I said yes. It's okay to say yes?

08:25.476 --> 08:27.409
I guess it's okay...

08:29.191 --> 08:31.192
- Sure is pretty, isn't it? 
- Yes, it is.

08:31.295 --> 08:32.365
I love the first snow of the year.

08:32.491 --> 08:33.485
I know, me too.

08:33.706 --> 08:35.565
Although this isn't actually the first snow of the year.

08:35.683 --> 08:36.727
- It isn't? 
- No.

08:36.856 --> 08:37.926
What happened to the first snow of the year?

08:38.024 --> 08:40.111
- I had a philosophy final. 
- Oh, right.

08:40.198 --> 08:42.205
And the second snow of the season was on Wednesday.

08:42.440 --> 08:43.972
Yeah, I had my walkthrough of the inn.

08:44.238 --> 08:46.481
So, actually this is the third snow of the season.

08:46.605 --> 08:47.786
Fourth, the third was on Saturday.

08:48.007 --> 08:49.272
It was? Why didn't you call me?

08:49.467 --> 08:50.879
Because, it happened in the middle of the night.

08:51.007 --> 08:52.251
You still could have called me.

08:52.370 --> 08:53.429
- In the middle of the night? 
- Yes.

08:53.557 --> 08:55.605
You wanted me to call you, at Yale, in the middle of the night

08:55.729 --> 08:59.220
so I could say, "Hey, drive 20 miles to stand in the snow with Mommy?"

08:59.333 --> 09:02.983
And then take the craziest mother-daughter title from Judy and Liza.

09:03.208 --> 09:04.539
So fourth snow of the season.

09:05.008 --> 09:06.562
- Still pretty. 
- Yes, we are.

09:08.203 --> 09:10.663
- The bells, they fixed the bells. 
- Oh, Stan.

09:37.682 --> 09:39.286
See, if we had taken our traditional

09:39.332 --> 09:41.504
"first snow of the season" walk, we wouldn't have heard the bells.

09:41.599 --> 09:43.282
Bless our oppressive schedules.

09:43.502 --> 09:45.065
I have to go drop something off at Lane's.

09:45.167 --> 09:46.703
Good, 'cause I have to go drop something off at Luke's.

09:47.537 --> 09:48.255
What?

09:48.449 --> 09:51.115
I'm just dropping off some stuff, and a few things and -

09:51.244 --> 09:52.508
- Mom? 
- I need coffee.

09:52.673 --> 09:53.431
I'll meet you there.

09:53.569 --> 09:55.233
Hurry, we can come back out for the bells in half an hour.

09:55.402 --> 09:57.548
Order me some coffee, a muffin and some onion rings.

09:57.665 --> 09:59.309
Look what I pass on to the next generation.

09:59.399 --> 10:00.664
Eating habits from Hades.

10:00.753 --> 10:01.817
Love that DNA!

10:02.191 --> 10:04.305
Pursue an interview with a distinguished leader

10:04.394 --> 10:07.226
with great influence on the community state or nation.

10:08.146 --> 10:10.362
Well, that sounds like it should be interesting.

10:10.455 --> 10:11.744
Who should we interview?

10:12.503 --> 10:14.936
- Oh, Jordan! 
- Pastor Cho is available.

10:15.104 --> 10:18.595
Yes! Pastor Cho would be interesting

10:18.791 --> 10:22.246
and... convenient since his house is right on campus,

10:22.378 --> 10:25.386
so okay, good option in Pastor Cho. Any other suggestions?

10:25.652 --> 10:27.105
Assistant Pastor Eric?

10:27.695 --> 10:30.981
Yes. Assistant Pastor Eric, also a fine idea,

10:31.065 --> 10:32.650
he lives next door to Pastor Cho.

10:32.983 --> 10:35.400
Would anyone like to think outside the clergy?

10:35.549 --> 10:36.261
Why?

10:36.435 --> 10:37.653
Pastor Cho did it last year.

10:37.810 --> 10:39.190
Pastor Cho does it every year.

10:39.327 --> 10:41.729
So then perhaps Pastor Cho might like a rest?

10:41.857 --> 10:43.491
Then it would be Assistant Pastor Eric!

10:43.726 --> 10:44.945
Hey, I have an idea.

10:45.139 --> 10:48.251
How about we send a letter to Bill Clinton.

10:48.400 --> 10:50.253
It's probably be a long shot, but you never know!

10:50.376 --> 10:51.806
- Bill Clinton? 
- Yeah!

10:51.943 --> 10:53.757
But Pastor Cho is expecting our call.

10:53.951 --> 10:56.961
Unless he's sick, in which case it would be Assistant Pastor Eric!

10:57.263 --> 11:00.365
- Yes, but I... 
- Lane! Rory is here to see you.

11:03.161 --> 11:05.430
Rory! Hi, and bless you.

11:05.572 --> 11:07.533
Lane! Hi and... thank you.

11:07.923 --> 11:12.162
Rory, this is Andy, Sarah, Jill, Marla and Jordan.

11:12.388 --> 11:14.703
Nice to meet you all. I didn't mean to interrupt,

11:14.810 --> 11:18.111
I just wanted to return your book and get another one.

11:18.204 --> 11:19.131
Oh, of course.

11:19.254 --> 11:20.114
I'll be right back

11:20.269 --> 11:21.532
Please hurry, the tea is almost ready.

11:21.731 --> 11:22.505
I will.

11:25.009 --> 11:26.990
So, how did you like it?

11:27.134 --> 11:29.202
It's great, I burned a copy for my Mom.

11:29.423 --> 11:32.300
You know, its people like you who are destroying the music industry!

11:32.439 --> 11:34.897
Oh, now. Britney's gotta shoulder some of the blame.

11:35.644 --> 11:39.340
Let me see. How about The New Pornographers?

11:39.499 --> 11:40.236
Sold.

11:40.820 --> 11:42.897
So, it's quite a lively bunch you got down there.

11:43.073 --> 11:45.653
Oh yeah, I'm kind of worried, all of those breakables.

11:45.792 --> 11:46.764
What are you working on?

11:46.984 --> 11:50.298
Oh, the usual: how to avoid any contact with the outside world.

11:50.492 --> 11:52.466
Those guys must really be screwing up the curve.

11:52.585 --> 11:54.613
- Yes, it's annoying. 
- Everyday?

11:54.905 --> 11:57.946
Yes, but I could care less because today, all I can think about is the gig!

11:58.104 --> 11:59.089
I mean, I can't believe it!

11:59.217 --> 12:01.710
I'm actually going to be on stage at CBGBs!

12:01.826 --> 12:03.584
I know, but how are you going to get there?

12:03.783 --> 12:07.189
Oh, I will get there. As we speak, I am working on the perfect alibi.

12:07.430 --> 12:08.498
Oh, what do ya got so far?

12:08.914 --> 12:14.382
Mama, may I run something past you?

12:15.801 --> 12:16.748
That's it.

12:17.325 --> 12:18.245
I like it.

12:18.409 --> 12:21.565
Yeah, so I was originally gonna start with "Can I run something past you,"

12:21.688 --> 12:24.003
but I thought the may I added a certain level of respect.

12:24.150 --> 12:27.387
I agree. However, you now need to add an excuse.

12:27.618 --> 12:30.500
I've come up with lots of, you know, mid-afternoon

12:30.618 --> 12:33.598
and evening alibis, but so far no 1:00 AM alibis.

12:33.716 --> 12:36.112
You can always tell your Mom that you're sleeping over at my dorm.

12:36.316 --> 12:38.697
She knows they're co-ed. By the way, she's praying for you.

12:38.942 --> 12:40.448
So, you wanna borrow the new Sparks?

12:40.627 --> 12:41.411
Please!

12:41.902 --> 12:43.070
Oh, now how about this?

12:43.603 --> 12:46.342
Tell your Mom that you're taking an astronomy class,

12:46.522 --> 12:48.548
and you have to go on a field trip to look at the stars.

12:48.779 --> 12:51.364
There are no astronomy classes at Adventist College.

12:51.445 --> 12:52.808
That would imply the universe is old.

12:52.931 --> 12:54.395
Not a lot of loopholes in your world, huh?

12:54.585 --> 12:55.777
It's okay, I'll come up with something.

12:55.931 --> 12:58.436
My entire life has been a training session for this very event.

12:58.697 --> 13:00.242
- I have faith in you. 
- Thank you.

13:00.621 --> 13:01.364
Wait!

13:03.053 --> 13:06.300
Oop! Getting a little sloppy, there.

13:10.047 --> 13:12.331
- Lane! Your classmates are waiting. 
- Sorry, Mama.

13:12.914 --> 13:14.896
I gotta go. Thank you for the book.

13:15.049 --> 13:16.299
- Bye, Mrs. Kim. 
- Wait!

13:19.054 --> 13:22.130
"Jane - One woman's harrowing journey to God."

13:22.929 --> 13:23.814
Good choice!

13:24.752 --> 13:25.991
Thank you, ma'am.

13:27.757 --> 13:29.278
Smart move, jumping on my bandwagon

13:29.334 --> 13:30.988
with the International Relations Association.

13:31.085 --> 13:32.621
- Like I had a choice. 
- What?

13:32.821 --> 13:34.157
You dragged me here, Paris.

13:34.337 --> 13:36.702
You'll thank me when you're interviewing for grad school in a few years

13:36.773 --> 13:39.083
and find those waifish looks of yours aren't quite as charming.

13:39.186 --> 13:40.092
Whatever that means.

13:40.243 --> 13:42.294
It means these kind of clubs look good on your resumé.

13:42.555 --> 13:44.854
You know what also looks good on a resumé? Passing your classes.

13:44.977 --> 13:46.799
No one studies more than you do, you're fine.

13:46.999 --> 13:50.818
Now, remember to argue, even if you have nothing to say, or add, be vocal.

13:50.956 --> 13:53.430
Very few people in lifelisten to what anyone else says anyhow.

13:53.532 --> 13:54.597
It's all about volume.

13:54.740 --> 13:57.633
Can I ask why you're suddenly so interested in international relations?

13:57.705 --> 13:58.479
You're pre-med.

13:58.601 --> 14:02.425
It's critical to step out of one's major and experience our worlds sweeping expanse.

14:02.614 --> 14:04.218
Plus, a certain fellow told me about it.

14:04.289 --> 14:05.395
Okay, enough with that.

14:06.676 --> 14:08.176
Oh, this is too much.

14:08.427 --> 14:10.648
- What? 
- Our advisor, Professor Friedman.

14:10.879 --> 14:12.661
- You know her? 
- Of her.

14:12.758 --> 14:14.805
Her daughter was busted last spring by New Haven police

14:14.883 --> 14:18.013
for growing pot in their basement, right during harvest season.

14:18.104 --> 14:19.356
Strangely, it never made the papers.

14:19.450 --> 14:20.464
Then how do you know about it?

14:20.509 --> 14:21.457
A certain fellow told me.

14:21.514 --> 14:23.371
I have got to stop asking questions.

14:35.312 --> 14:37.099
- Luke? 
- Yeah, Kirk.

14:37.309 --> 14:39.228
- What time is it? 
- I'm not saying, Kirk.

14:39.325 --> 14:39.935
Why not?

14:40.006 --> 14:41.619
Because I just told you 30 seconds ago!

14:41.702 --> 14:44.513
More like 45 seconds if you add in all the bickering.

14:45.219 --> 14:46.765
3:58.

14:47.100 --> 14:48.557
Only two minutes until the bells.

14:48.726 --> 14:50.538
Unless of course, I'm fast.

14:51.173 --> 14:52.766
You're cruel at times, Luke.

14:52.853 --> 14:54.323
Only when poked with a stick.

14:54.419 --> 14:55.828
Coffee, big cup and hello!

14:56.488 --> 14:57.804
Lorelai, what time do you have?

14:57.911 --> 14:59.509
Do not tell him. He already knows.

14:59.592 --> 15:00.513
I do not!

15:00.628 --> 15:03.000
If you just wait for the bells, then you'll get to hear the bells,

15:03.108 --> 15:04.307
and then you'll know what time it is.

15:04.389 --> 15:05.935
Actually, that's not true.

15:06.037 --> 15:09.019
The other day I stood too close to the bells and they rang so loud

15:09.084 --> 15:11.607
that there's now a persistent ringing in my ears.

15:11.781 --> 15:14.536
Now I can't tell which are the church bells and which are the Kirk bells.

15:14.624 --> 15:15.980
Oh, no. Did you go to the doctor?

15:16.062 --> 15:17.634
Yes, he said I have tinnitis.

15:17.932 --> 15:21.280
I looked it up on the web at "Celebrities Who Share Your Disease"

15:21.407 --> 15:24.265
and found that William Shatner is likewise afflicted.

15:24.362 --> 15:26.082
Really, Kirk and Captain Kirk?

15:26.164 --> 15:27.670
The irony wasn't lost on me.

15:28.038 --> 15:28.903
Was that them?

15:29.124 --> 15:32.078
Relax, the church bells will be the loud obnoxious ones.

15:32.165 --> 15:33.850
Somebody doesn't like bells.

15:34.008 --> 15:35.566
Not everyone likes bells.

15:35.744 --> 15:36.983
No, actually they do.

15:37.085 --> 15:39.589
They enjoy the constant interruptions of conversations,

15:39.691 --> 15:43.390
the monotonous drone of the same tones, hour after hour?

15:43.931 --> 15:45.472
Yes! Can you believe it?

15:45.559 --> 15:49.338
These are the same freaks who also like sunsets and the moon and the stars...

15:49.491 --> 15:50.511
What are the paint chips for?

15:50.739 --> 15:53.070
Oh, I'm just doing some painting.

15:53.167 --> 15:57.197
Oh, really? You're not gonna collect and trade them amongst your friends?

15:57.421 --> 15:58.375
What are you painting?

15:58.702 --> 16:00.361
Our apartment.

16:00.541 --> 16:02.204
You and I, we're getting an apartment?

16:02.343 --> 16:04.728
No. Me and Nicole. We're getting an apartment.

16:05.963 --> 16:07.888
Oh! That's great. When?

16:08.164 --> 16:09.367
When what?

16:09.536 --> 16:10.734
When are you getting an apartment?

16:10.924 --> 16:11.882
Three weeks ago.

16:12.056 --> 16:13.627
Three weeks … You moved already?

16:17.066 --> 16:18.910
So, where is the apartment?

16:19.192 --> 16:20.048
Litchfield.

16:20.855 --> 16:22.645
You moved to Litchfield?

16:22.967 --> 16:25.127
Three weeks ago you moved to Litchfield?

16:25.464 --> 16:26.893
Litchfield is another county.

16:28.552 --> 16:30.175
Three weeks ago you moved to another county?

16:30.283 --> 16:32.960
Were you gonna mention this to me anytime soon?

16:33.207 --> 16:34.113
- Sure. 
- When?

16:34.235 --> 16:35.551
- When it came up. 
- When it came up.

16:35.689 --> 16:38.218
Okay, so if I hadn't asked for the next twenty or thirty years

16:38.312 --> 16:41.265
and I sent you a nice fruit basket upstairs you just never would have gotten it.

16:41.397 --> 16:43.186
- It's not that big a deal. 
- Okay.

16:43.297 --> 16:44.941
I mean it's not like we tell each other everything.

16:45.182 --> 16:46.519
No! Of course we don't!

16:46.738 --> 16:50.138
I mean, I tore a pair of panty hose this morning and I didn't tell you about it.

16:50.302 --> 16:51.648
Oh wait, I guess I just did.

16:51.805 --> 16:53.717
- Hey, you know now, right? 
- Yeah. Right.

16:53.852 --> 16:55.116
Look, nothing's changed.

16:55.263 --> 16:57.772
Yeah nothing's changed, except you don't live here!

16:57.936 --> 16:59.170
- So what? 
- So?

16:59.323 --> 17:01.991
- I don't even have your phone number. 
- I'll give you my phone number.

17:02.110 --> 17:03.670
I don't even know what you live in!

17:03.864 --> 17:06.962
- An apartment, a trailer, a batcave... 
- A townhouse.

17:07.178 --> 17:10.868
A townhouse? Sure, 'cause when I look at you I think "common driveway".

17:11.028 --> 17:13.275
It's fine, you'll come over and see it eventually.

17:13.444 --> 17:16.414
Will I? Will I come over, because me coming over implies we're friends!

17:16.561 --> 17:19.060
- We are friends! 
- No, we're not!

17:19.194 --> 17:22.310
We're not friends! Friends tell each other at least the most basic things

17:22.425 --> 17:25.113
like where you live and when you moved away.

17:25.267 --> 17:27.709
I thought we were friends but I guess we're not!

17:27.857 --> 17:29.137
- Where are you going? 
- I can't stay!

17:29.275 --> 17:30.304
Lorelai!

17:32.061 --> 17:33.505
Damn bells!

17:35.968 --> 17:38.014
Oh! This is the tragedy that results when your mom

17:38.110 --> 17:41.257
goes out of town leaving your dad in charge of the care package.

17:41.446 --> 17:42.986
Cling peaches in light syrup.

17:43.085 --> 17:46.254
They make Rice Krispies Treats in foil packs now, how hard is that?

17:46.352 --> 17:48.716
Hey, want your smile back? Pork Top Ramen.

17:48.840 --> 17:51.062
For that, you share your care package.

17:51.163 --> 17:53.366
Fine. My mom doesn't bake but she knows people who do.

17:53.919 --> 17:55.818
This makes great packing material…

17:55.894 --> 17:58.337
Look, look, look. The guy over by the vending machine.

17:59.633 --> 18:01.245
Two thumbs up!

18:01.322 --> 18:03.953
That is my friend Josh's roommate, William.

18:04.036 --> 18:05.684
Ah! Hello your highness.

18:05.767 --> 18:07.185
I'm seriously debating a move here.

18:07.318 --> 18:08.639
Nakedness tends to work.

18:08.730 --> 18:10.636
I met him at this party this weekend.

18:10.804 --> 18:12.775
He's pretty cool - and funny!

18:12.944 --> 18:15.131
He tells this story about a girl in this dorm.

18:15.249 --> 18:18.331
She doesn't even know him, she just comes up to him and starts talking to him,

18:18.406 --> 18:20.543
and he's talking to her, you know, just to be nice,

18:20.645 --> 18:22.678
but she thinks he's into her or something,

18:22.780 --> 18:25.418
so like three seconds later she asks him out.

18:25.534 --> 18:29.263
Of course he said no. But I guess to her no doesn't mean 'no',

18:29.385 --> 18:31.864
so now she's showing up everywhere he is.

18:32.160 --> 18:35.109
He calls her his "adoring fan."

18:35.206 --> 18:36.653
Did he say who it was?

18:36.753 --> 18:40.112
Someone cranked up the karaoke machine right at that moment so no, no names.

18:40.310 --> 18:43.122
But his impression of her asking him out,

18:43.215 --> 18:47.551
all flitty eyelashes and 'look how hot I am' is hilarious.

18:47.710 --> 18:49.363
Oooh, intrigue.

18:49.595 --> 18:51.442
Psycho girl in the dorm.

18:51.750 --> 18:53.055
I wonder who it can be?

18:54.233 --> 18:56.855
So, now that he lives in Litchfield, what's that supposed to mean?

18:56.931 --> 18:58.191
According to Luke, nothing!

18:58.293 --> 18:59.188
But what about the diner?

18:59.287 --> 19:01.807
Oh, he said the diner's fine, everything's fine!

19:02.003 --> 19:04.115
And he's gonna continue working here even though he's living there?

19:04.217 --> 19:07.396
Yes, apparently he'll go from being grumpy Luke to grumpy-commuter Luke.

19:07.515 --> 19:09.921
Luke plus road-rage, there's a healthy combination.

19:10.116 --> 19:11.999
Ooh! What do you think of that sconce?

19:12.147 --> 19:15.502
Oh, it's too British. I swear, that guy should work for the CIA.

19:15.603 --> 19:17.181
He gives away nothing, absolutely nothing!

19:17.370 --> 19:18.655
I have friends there.

19:18.917 --> 19:20.857
- What? Where? 
- The CIA.

19:21.216 --> 19:22.726
- No, you don't. 
- Yes, I...

19:22.828 --> 19:25.403
Ah, you didn't mean the Culinary Institute of America?

19:25.480 --> 19:26.213
No.

19:26.336 --> 19:29.448
Okay, then. Oh! What about this?

19:29.520 --> 19:32.060
No, too Spanish. Three weeks he's been living there!

19:32.091 --> 19:33.739
Three weeks, and not a single word,

19:33.801 --> 19:36.436
and he looked at me like I was completely insane to be upset.

19:37.011 --> 19:38.680
- What about this one? 
- Too German.

19:38.772 --> 19:39.966
How can a sconce be too German?

19:40.078 --> 19:41.419
It's shaped like an knockwurst.

19:41.526 --> 19:42.535
It is not.

19:42.653 --> 19:44.854
Oh, it is. Why would they do that?

19:45.162 --> 19:47.441
Maybe I am insane, I mean what's the big deal right?

19:47.513 --> 19:50.282
Just because I go in there for coffee every day that doesn't make us friends.

19:50.569 --> 19:51.542
You are friends!

19:51.659 --> 19:54.008
Yes, but I thought we were 'friend' friends,

19:54.100 --> 19:55.459
and apparently we're just coffee friends.

19:55.556 --> 19:57.584
I buy the coffee and he's my friend.

19:57.712 --> 19:59.013
It's like a dog and a liver treat.

19:59.192 --> 20:01.414
If you have a liver treat, the dog will like you and, that's us.

20:01.552 --> 20:03.261
Which one are you, the dog or the liver treat?

20:03.400 --> 20:04.496
I was the liver treat,

20:04.603 --> 20:08.048
and I thought I was a collar or at least a really cute leash and I'm not.

20:08.169 --> 20:10.348
I wanna chime in and be supportive,

20:10.439 --> 20:12.125
but I don't know what you're talking about.

20:12.227 --> 20:13.665
I'm talking about nothing, nevermind.

20:15.860 --> 20:17.916
I'm coming, Cookie.

20:18.785 --> 20:19.856
What's the matter, is he hungry?

20:20.065 --> 20:21.571
No, it's the bells.

20:21.734 --> 20:22.768
The bells aren't ringing.

20:22.937 --> 20:24.423
No, but they're about to.

20:24.611 --> 20:26.086
He's crying in anticipation of the bells?

20:26.292 --> 20:27.295
He hates them.

20:27.478 --> 20:30.382
At first he just cried when they rang, and now he knows their schedule.

20:30.517 --> 20:31.774
Oh, that's terrible!

20:31.913 --> 20:34.176
Believe me, the 5:00 AM-ers are the worst.

20:35.000 --> 20:36.950
Oh, oh, I know.

20:37.499 --> 20:38.569
Poor thing.

20:39.547 --> 20:40.864
Hey, Sookie.

20:41.518 --> 20:43.122
Look, it's Luke.

20:43.675 --> 20:44.596
What's he doing?

20:48.006 --> 20:50.114
He's shovelling my walk.

20:50.657 --> 20:51.733
He's good.

20:53.080 --> 20:54.218
I'll be right back.

20:59.548 --> 21:00.673
Oh, you missed a spot.

21:02.465 --> 21:03.734
This is really nice Luke.

21:03.909 --> 21:06.074
Can we fight again 'cause I need my rain gutters cleaned.

21:06.377 --> 21:09.131
You think everything is your business.

21:09.331 --> 21:11.461
Everything is about you!

21:11.548 --> 21:14.743
Well, here's a newsflash. Some things are not about you.

21:14.855 --> 21:15.751
Why are you yelling at me?

21:15.879 --> 21:19.002
If I want to move in with Nicole, it concerns her and it concerns me,

21:19.192 --> 21:20.815
- and that is it. 
- Yeah, I know.

21:20.938 --> 21:23.790
It does not concern you! It is none of your business!

21:23.964 --> 21:26.333
I don't have to tell you anything!

21:26.621 --> 21:30.001
And you do not have the right to make me feel guilty because I didn't tell you anything.

21:30.092 --> 21:32.341
- I wasn't trying... 
- I have been tying my own shoes

21:32.422 --> 21:36.001
since I was I was four, I have repairing my own car since I was fourteen,

21:36.124 --> 21:39.084
and I have been making my own decisions since I could crawl!

21:39.171 --> 21:39.996
What does any of that have to do with anything?

21:40.109 --> 21:42.258
I owe you nothing!

21:42.611 --> 21:43.563
- Fine. 
- Nothing!

21:43.737 --> 21:44.531
Fine!

21:44.684 --> 21:46.888
And shovel your walk! It is a safety hazard

21:47.051 --> 21:51.096
and you can't just walk past it and ignore the fact that the snow is up to your ass!

21:51.228 --> 21:52.743
You've got my shovel!

21:52.832 --> 21:55.013
I loaned it to you three years ago!

21:57.741 --> 22:00.286
When you boil it down, isn't the whole Israeli-Palestinian problem

22:00.389 --> 22:02.386
- a case of sibling rivalry? 
- Follow up?

22:02.632 --> 22:04.331
The Old Testament, it's all there.

22:04.647 --> 22:06.922
Israelis are descendents of Abraham and Sarah.

22:07.050 --> 22:09.548
Arabs are descendents of Abraham and his maid Hagar.

22:09.707 --> 22:11.933
So Israelis and Arabs both have the same dad,

22:12.062 --> 22:14.582
and both want the great nation God promised Abraham.

22:14.786 --> 22:17.003
They might as well be fighting over who gets the TV remote.

22:17.120 --> 22:18.825
Your Biblical facts are correct, Paris,

22:18.919 --> 22:21.959
but your arguments disregard the complexities of the last 4000 years.

22:22.683 --> 22:24.222
I know research takes time.

22:24.382 --> 22:27.095
At least I don't have to worry about Cheech growing Thai stick in the rec room.

22:27.198 --> 22:28.160
- What? 
- Nothing.

22:28.303 --> 22:29.404
Okay. Anyone else?

22:29.584 --> 22:31.603
It's just a power struggle, nothing mysterious.

22:31.769 --> 22:33.773
- Follow up? 
- Who wins in this game?

22:33.971 --> 22:36.132
And in whose best interest is it to keep the kids fighting?

22:36.249 --> 22:38.436
Right, like they're some all powerful entity,

22:38.539 --> 22:40.581
manipulating the entire population of Israel.

22:40.679 --> 22:42.291
There's a good thought process for you.

22:42.471 --> 22:44.059
- Excuse me? 
- It's more complex than that.

22:44.217 --> 22:46.582
- But if you disregard power... 
- That's not what I said.

22:46.705 --> 22:49.818
Maybe if you sat up straight for a minute you could hear a little more clearly.

22:49.957 --> 22:51.113
Decorum, people.

22:51.442 --> 22:54.012
Israel is made up of over 6 million individuals,

22:54.170 --> 22:56.798
each with a unique view on the situation.

22:56.893 --> 22:59.433
You know something about a unique view of a situation, don't you?

22:59.735 --> 23:00.519
I guess -

23:00.740 --> 23:04.352
Because propaganda and the spreading of blatant, heinous, ridiculous lies

23:04.462 --> 23:08.492
can cause more damage than guns or bombs or any sort of weaponry.

23:08.599 --> 23:10.407
Personally, if I'm in an alley with Osama,

23:10.514 --> 23:13.550
I'd rather he was armed with a blatant, heinous lie than an Uzi.

23:13.687 --> 23:14.630
That's cause you're an idiot.

23:14.768 --> 23:16.812
You know, you didn't look scary when you came in here.

23:16.903 --> 23:18.275
Oh yeah, give me back my pencil.

23:18.434 --> 23:21.697
Okay, you two. Let's take a cooling off period and hear from someone else.

23:22.336 --> 23:23.943
Sarah, your thoughts on this.

23:24.828 --> 23:26.790
- I'm starving. 
- Order a pizza.

23:26.964 --> 23:28.858
No, it's snowing, they won't deliver.

23:28.976 --> 23:30.798
- Then go to Al's. 
- It's curry night!

23:31.059 --> 23:32.401
China Charlie's sounds pretty good.

23:32.611 --> 23:34.004
- I hate Chinese. 
- Since when?

23:34.117 --> 23:34.824
Since tonight!

23:34.982 --> 23:36.267
You're acting like a four year old.

23:36.385 --> 23:37.681
I don't care, I'm bored.

23:37.804 --> 23:39.328
This is stupid, just go to Luke's.

23:39.488 --> 23:40.409
No. Way.

23:40.543 --> 23:42.237
Oh, come on, you guys always fight.

23:42.355 --> 23:44.203
- Not like this. 
- And then you make up.

23:44.357 --> 23:45.892
No, I'm not going to Luke's.

23:46.067 --> 23:48.530
- You're gonna starve to death. 
- Well fine, I will starve to death,

23:48.683 --> 23:50.649
because I'm not going to reward bad behavior.

23:50.777 --> 23:51.945
Is there something in the fridge?

23:52.231 --> 23:53.224
Nothing edible.

23:53.475 --> 23:55.314
There's Beefaroni. You like Beefaroni.

23:55.480 --> 23:56.773
I'm not in the mood for Beefaroni.

23:57.128 --> 23:58.540
Mom, you have to do something.

23:58.668 --> 23:59.625
I need a suggestion.

23:59.799 --> 24:01.687
- Have you read The Bell Jar? 
- Not funny!

24:01.821 --> 24:03.439
Okay, you know what, you're on your own.

24:03.547 --> 24:05.021
No, no! Come on!

24:05.257 --> 24:07.141
I have to study and you're in your stubborn mood.

24:07.331 --> 24:09.905
Hey! I sat up with you all night when you had the chicken pox.

24:10.017 --> 24:13.055
I held your hands so that you couldn't scratch your face and scar your perfect skin.

24:13.167 --> 24:14.985
- You look that way because of me. 
- Night, mom.

24:15.128 --> 24:16.485
But, ah, the chicken pox!

24:16.680 --> 24:18.225
Beefaroni, it's calling you!

24:32.532 --> 24:34.958
One, and two, and three and four.

24:35.082 --> 24:37.518
Ignore the bells, they aren't the beat.

24:37.765 --> 24:40.252
The bells will screw, it all to hell.

24:40.513 --> 24:43.226
And one, and two, and three, and four...

24:58.162 --> 24:59.836
You want to help me break the bells?

25:00.549 --> 25:01.664
I'll get my toolbox.

25:07.533 --> 25:08.751
- I'll just be a sec. 
- 'Kay.

25:23.982 --> 25:25.165
Got it, let's go.

25:25.626 --> 25:26.558
Right behind you.

25:37.751 --> 25:40.142
Sorry, Zack, anything immobile is fair game.

25:40.981 --> 25:42.491
- I'm so hyped. 
- Me too.

25:42.620 --> 25:43.721
Did you find Blondie anywhere?

25:43.823 --> 25:45.677
No, I think they repainted at some point.

25:45.789 --> 25:47.821
Repainting is so not rock and roll!

25:49.051 --> 25:51.324
You have seriously gotta stop that.

25:51.591 --> 25:52.363
Sue me.

25:52.503 --> 25:53.716
Hey, here are The Strokes!

25:53.931 --> 25:54.749
Yawn.

25:55.276 --> 25:57.754
Hey, you almost done, you've been tuning for a half hour.

25:57.985 --> 25:59.869
Almost. Geez, I'm nervous.

25:59.996 --> 26:01.399
Yeah, you're shaking like the Pope.

26:01.650 --> 26:03.197
- You do it for me. 
- Fine.

26:03.423 --> 26:04.887
So, do we get to sign the wall?

26:05.029 --> 26:06.521
Oh, we are signing the wall!

26:06.627 --> 26:09.085
It's the whole reason to be in the band, that and the loose chicks.

26:09.168 --> 26:10.478
Here are The Strokes again!

26:10.626 --> 26:11.936
Yeah, they're over there too.

26:12.081 --> 26:14.226
Man, they're overexposed, even on walls.

26:15.697 --> 26:18.671
Hey guys, bad news. I'm gonna have to bump you.

26:18.957 --> 26:20.225
- What? 
- What does that mean?

26:20.442 --> 26:22.038
It means you're bumped. You're not playing.

26:22.172 --> 26:23.089
We'll reschedule, okay?

26:23.273 --> 26:24.230
Drag!

26:24.440 --> 26:25.592
I guess I can stop tuning.

26:25.735 --> 26:27.902
No, don't stop tuning. I don't get this, why are we being bumped?

26:28.092 --> 26:29.816
There's like two people out in the audience

26:29.965 --> 26:33.056
and they're born again or something, and they're not even drinking.

26:33.226 --> 26:34.573
I'll get 'em drinking, I'm very good

26:34.676 --> 26:36.031
at working around religious mandates.

26:36.272 --> 26:38.208
- Older couple? 
- Yeah.

26:38.501 --> 26:40.228
That's my parents. They don't drink.

26:40.516 --> 26:43.000
We'll just play for Brian's parents, that's fine with us.

26:43.164 --> 26:45.945
- This is unbelievable! 
- Look guys, it happens.

26:46.077 --> 26:48.965
- I'm sorry, we're playing tonight. 
- To an empty room.

26:49.114 --> 26:51.295
Every band plays to empty rooms at some point.

26:51.412 --> 26:52.882
They can be the most classic gigs.

26:53.066 --> 26:54.418
Look, I've already sent people home.

26:54.571 --> 26:56.015
The doorman, the waitresses-

26:56.199 --> 26:57.573
You don't need them, there's no one out there.

26:57.715 --> 26:59.298
- The sound guy. 
- We don't need sound!

26:59.456 --> 27:00.792
Look, it's not up to you.

27:01.145 --> 27:02.364
We'll reschedule, okay?

27:02.855 --> 27:05.053
- Nice goin', dude. 
- Don't dump on Gil!

27:05.318 --> 27:08.046
Excuse me, we're not done.

27:08.349 --> 27:09.293
I think we are.

27:09.431 --> 27:12.420
No, we are not just little gnats that you can flick away.

27:12.522 --> 27:13.961
We are professionals and some of us have gone through

27:14.058 --> 27:16.276
a lot of trouble to be here tonight, a lot of trouble.

27:16.398 --> 27:18.395
Then you have a lot of my sympathies.

27:19.194 --> 27:20.197
I need a cigarette.

27:20.694 --> 27:22.112
Get cancer, Darryl!

27:22.199 --> 27:24.355
Lane! Come on, you gotta roll with the punches.

27:24.421 --> 27:26.065
- No, we have to play tonight. 
- We can't!

27:26.629 --> 27:27.990
What are you doing?

27:29.783 --> 27:30.592
Packing up?

27:30.986 --> 27:32.451
Just because Darryl said to?

27:32.681 --> 27:33.428
He's the booker.

27:33.576 --> 27:36.223
No, he's the man, and rock and roll is about saying no to the man!

27:36.336 --> 27:38.608
- This is a lot of trouble for nothing! 
- Guys!

27:38.727 --> 27:40.689
- I said I'm sorry! 
- It's not Gil's fault!

27:40.801 --> 27:41.502
Then whose is it?

27:41.666 --> 27:43.530
Look, you gotta roll with the punches too, Zack.

27:43.678 --> 27:45.203
You just stepped on my guitar!

27:45.337 --> 27:46.975
- I didn't see it. 
- What are you blind?

27:47.073 --> 27:49.187
- Pretty much. 
- Dude, get it together.

27:49.301 --> 27:51.045
I cannot believe that your parents don't drink.

27:57.886 --> 28:00.021
What, they lock the door to a church, are they serious?

28:00.103 --> 28:01.204
What if I need to do something holy?

28:01.338 --> 28:02.571
Like commit vandalism?

28:02.765 --> 28:04.481
Even she's sick of hearing the damn bells.

28:04.583 --> 28:06.104
- I'm gonna have to break the lock 
- No wait.

28:06.826 --> 28:07.435
What are you doing?

28:07.685 --> 28:09.924
All those years of watching Hart to Hart are about to pay off.

28:10.388 --> 28:12.027
- What is that? 
- It's my gym card.

28:12.267 --> 28:13.174
You joined a gym?

28:13.334 --> 28:14.141
- Yeah. 
- When?

28:14.261 --> 28:16.307
After I had Rory, to lose the pregnancy weight.

28:16.441 --> 28:18.956
- Did you go? 
- God, no. I was way too fat.

28:21.311 --> 28:26.211
Ah, praise be to Him and all the little lambs that frolic the earth

28:26.288 --> 28:28.597
- with their frankincense and myrrh and... 
- Would you get inside?

28:33.778 --> 28:35.830
Oy! Would it kill God to dust?

28:35.984 --> 28:40.261
Okay, now just hold the flashlight, do not do any moving spotlight gags

28:40.378 --> 28:43.312
and point it at me and yell "Freeze, drop your weapons."

28:44.064 --> 28:47.412
How about if I shine it on the wall and do a dirty hand puppet show?

28:47.541 --> 28:50.101
Just stand back so the lightning only strikes you.

28:50.244 --> 28:52.279
So, what's the game plan here?

28:52.487 --> 28:55.241
Personally, I thought we could whack the bells really hard with a hammer.

28:55.394 --> 28:57.408
You don't break bells with a hammer.

28:57.556 --> 28:59.117
Okay, I'm out. What's your plan, Clyde?

28:59.250 --> 29:03.013
I was thinking we could just jam the turnbuckle,

29:03.132 --> 29:05.288
or wedge the main mechanism,

29:05.630 --> 29:08.123
just for fun disconnect a few of the clappers;

29:08.225 --> 29:10.745
Contrary to popular belief you don't have to break every bell.

29:10.944 --> 29:12.316
If you just damage a couple,

29:12.572 --> 29:15.183
say the tierce and the prime, you pretty much ruin the set.

29:15.327 --> 29:17.790
You must have been the top of your class at hunchback school.

29:17.913 --> 29:19.561
Let's just say you can wait your whole life

29:19.705 --> 29:22.787
waiting for bells to fall into disrepair. Sometimes they need a push.

29:22.946 --> 29:25.660
No way! You broke the bells.

29:25.787 --> 29:26.633
You're welcome.

29:27.176 --> 29:30.089
It's a little narrow up there, so we should just take the tools that we need,

29:30.172 --> 29:31.169
leave the toolbox down here.

29:31.287 --> 29:33.381
God, these things are heavy. Don't you have a smaller toolbox?

29:33.591 --> 29:35.803
No, why would I have two toolboxes?

29:36.003 --> 29:37.441
'Cause then you'd have a big one and a small one.

29:37.574 --> 29:39.276
If you have a big one you don't need a small one.

29:39.525 --> 29:42.286
Don't say 'dirty', it's too easy. Hold these.

29:44.456 --> 29:48.100
So, why wasn't your toolbox at your new place?

29:48.250 --> 29:49.334
I needed it here.

29:50.056 --> 29:53.350
Usually moving requires lots of tools;

29:53.672 --> 29:55.914
hanging things, putting things together.

29:56.009 --> 29:58.024
Nicole hired a professional picture-hanger

29:58.121 --> 29:59.622
and we didn't have anything to put together.

29:59.755 --> 30:01.629
- Hand me a screwdriver. 
- Phillips or flathead?

30:02.273 --> 30:03.969
- I know things. 
- Phillips.

30:06.457 --> 30:08.515
Luke, how come you told me you moved?

30:08.618 --> 30:09.497
I did move.

30:09.622 --> 30:11.618
You may have moved, but none of your stuff did.

30:11.838 --> 30:14.320
What are you talking about? Hand me the open-ended wrench.

30:14.905 --> 30:17.947
Luke, I was in your apartment. It's exactly the same.

30:18.131 --> 30:19.000
No, it's not.

30:19.149 --> 30:22.098
I just think it's weird you're pretending you moved when you didn't.

30:22.970 --> 30:24.110
I did move.

30:24.260 --> 30:25.872
- Luke, your bed wasn't even made. 
- So?

30:25.970 --> 30:28.590
There were dishes in the sink, some kind of shake in the blender,

30:28.795 --> 30:30.357
Mega-Man protein powder on the counter.

30:30.485 --> 30:31.971
Remind me to mock you for that later, by the way.

30:32.078 --> 30:33.147
Can we talk about something else?

30:33.270 --> 30:35.488
Or better yet, let's not talk and just get this done.

30:35.620 --> 30:36.732
Does Nicole think you moved?

30:36.911 --> 30:38.835
Of course she thinks I moved, I did move.

30:39.020 --> 30:41.801
- Do you sleep there? 
- Of course I sleep there.

30:41.938 --> 30:43.100
When was the last time you slept there?

30:43.233 --> 30:45.036
- I live there. 
- So, last night?

30:46.138 --> 30:49.387
I had an early delivery and it didn't make sense to sleep there.

30:49.824 --> 30:51.620
- The day before? 
- I was there for dinner.

30:51.728 --> 30:52.439
And after dinner?

30:52.543 --> 30:55.445
Nicole was getting a sore throat so it made sense to go back to my place

30:55.554 --> 30:56.950
- and not get sick. 
- Your place?

30:57.800 --> 30:58.578
My old place.

30:58.773 --> 31:00.596
You didn't say your old place, you said your place.

31:00.703 --> 31:02.306
Well, I meant my old place.

31:02.466 --> 31:05.772
- Luke, you don't live with Nicole. 
- Yes, I do.

31:05.886 --> 31:08.871
You watch her TV, you eat her food, you keep stuff in a duffel bag at her house;

31:08.972 --> 31:10.290
you're a rude guest, not her boyfriend!

31:10.386 --> 31:12.418
- Husband. 
- Whole other discussion.

31:12.501 --> 31:13.873
You know what, you're doing it again.

31:13.975 --> 31:14.527
Doing what again?

31:14.621 --> 31:17.124
You're passing judgment on my relationship with Nicole.

31:17.230 --> 31:18.230
I'm not passing judgment.

31:18.367 --> 31:20.850
You passed judgment on our marriage, you passed judgment on our divorce

31:20.990 --> 31:24.010
and now you're passing judgment on our living together.

31:24.133 --> 31:25.623
I'm not passing judgment on you living together.

31:25.756 --> 31:28.229
You're passing judgment on you living together… by not living together.

31:28.372 --> 31:30.271
You know, I was a little tipsy on that cruise ship,

31:30.385 --> 31:33.149
but I don't remember anyone pronouncing us husband and wife and Lorelai.

31:33.299 --> 31:34.357
They may as well have,

31:34.470 --> 31:36.395
because I spend as much time with Nicole as you do.

31:36.513 --> 31:37.660
And the judgment's back!

31:37.816 --> 31:40.036
I could move in with you guys. You wouldn't know.

31:40.188 --> 31:42.418
You know, none of this is any of your business.

31:42.529 --> 31:43.912
- It's absolutely my business. 
- How?

31:44.044 --> 31:47.603
Because! I wasted a week of my life adjusting to the idea

31:47.715 --> 31:50.183
that you had moved only to find out that you haven't moved.

31:50.275 --> 31:52.918
How much adjusting did you have to do? Nothing's changed!

31:53.013 --> 31:55.442
I still see you everyday, I still cook your food,

31:55.534 --> 31:57.823
I still serve your coffee. What do you care?

31:58.643 --> 32:00.300
- I care. 
- Why?

32:01.197 --> 32:02.578
Because I don't want you to move.

32:03.066 --> 32:05.718
Why? Why don't you want me to move?

32:10.342 --> 32:12.210
Lorelai? Luke?

32:15.887 --> 32:18.128
Oh, thank God! Carry on.

32:24.949 --> 32:27.242
Paris! It's 4:00 in the morning!

32:30.131 --> 32:31.052
What are you doing here?

32:31.144 --> 32:32.438
Funny you should ask,

32:32.581 --> 32:34.912
because I didn't know what to do and you always seem to know what to do,

32:35.036 --> 32:37.872
so I thought I'd drop by and ask you what to do.

32:37.978 --> 32:38.661
About what?

32:38.824 --> 32:39.776
I didn't come up with one.

32:39.985 --> 32:41.303
- One what? 
- One alibi.

32:41.476 --> 32:42.019
What?

32:42.208 --> 32:43.150
I couldn't think of anything!

32:43.510 --> 32:44.148
Lane!

32:44.375 --> 32:46.826
I swear, I tried, but nothing I came up with sounded

32:46.925 --> 32:48.194
like she would believe it so I just left.

32:48.343 --> 32:49.305
What do you mean you just left?

32:49.483 --> 32:53.518
I mean I waited until she went to bed, which was about 9:15, and then I left.

32:53.678 --> 32:54.849
You didn't leave a note?

32:56.262 --> 32:57.067
You didn't call?

32:57.235 --> 32:59.484
I don't even think I locked the door behind me.

32:59.606 --> 33:00.656
Lane, this is bad.

33:00.789 --> 33:03.534
I know, but I couldn't miss the gig, Rory.

33:03.640 --> 33:05.214
I mean it was CBGB's!

33:05.664 --> 33:07.625
I had to go and she wouldn't let me go.

33:09.395 --> 33:10.190
Where are you going?

33:10.537 --> 33:11.588
You have to call your mom.

33:11.981 --> 33:12.724
No way.

33:13.246 --> 33:14.869
Lane, she could be freaking out right now.

33:15.002 --> 33:16.554
I can't tell her. I can't call her.

33:16.784 --> 33:18.355
Well, what are you gonna do, just never go home again?

33:18.515 --> 33:19.774
You say that like it's a bad thing.

33:19.928 --> 33:21.669
It is a bad thing, a really bad thing!

33:21.858 --> 33:22.769
I can't talk to her.

33:23.183 --> 33:23.799
Fine.

33:25.315 --> 33:26.246
Who are you calling?

33:31.358 --> 33:32.293
I hate you.

33:32.390 --> 33:33.844
- Mom, are you awake? 
- No.

33:34.028 --> 33:35.667
- Could you be awake? 
- What's the matter?

33:35.943 --> 33:37.720
- Lane's here. 
- What? Why?

33:37.848 --> 33:40.234
She snuck out of her house tonight, and she's scared to go home.

33:40.486 --> 33:41.827
She snuck out?

33:42.001 --> 33:43.439
She had something to do with the band.

33:43.676 --> 33:45.601
She snuck out!

33:45.748 --> 33:46.615
Yes.

33:46.895 --> 33:47.684
Bye.

33:47.924 --> 33:48.672
What are you doing?

33:48.831 --> 33:50.050
I'm calling Mrs. Kim.

33:50.249 --> 33:51.126
Mom, no.

33:51.349 --> 33:53.264
Rory, if I woke up and you weren't there,

33:53.368 --> 33:54.770
I would have a friggin' heart attack.

33:54.915 --> 33:58.508
Now keep Lane there and tell her I am pissed as hell at her.

33:58.728 --> 33:59.742
Goodbye.

34:03.714 --> 34:09.460
Mrs. Kim, it's Lorelai Gilmore. I am so sorry to be calling so late and,

34:09.612 --> 34:13.621
I don't know if you know this or not, but Lane isn't there.

34:13.858 --> 34:14.723
Where is she?

34:14.860 --> 34:18.481
Well, she went out tonight, and I think she was just scared to tell you about it,

34:18.603 --> 34:21.154
but she is fine. She's with Rory at Yale

34:21.303 --> 34:24.266
and they're safe and they promise to stay put.

34:24.368 --> 34:25.464
Give me the address!

34:25.629 --> 34:29.628
198 Elm Street, Durfee Hall, suite five. Do you need directions?

34:29.744 --> 34:31.148
I have a navigational system.

34:31.333 --> 34:33.579
Okay, well, call me if you need anything.

34:57.097 --> 34:57.895
Luke!

34:58.520 --> 35:00.531
Hey, Mrs. Kim. You're up early.

35:00.843 --> 35:03.281
I just want to tell you that Lane will not be coming to work today.

35:03.497 --> 35:04.833
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I know.

35:05.180 --> 35:05.846
You know?

35:06.026 --> 35:06.743
Yeah, she called.

35:07.105 --> 35:08.463
- She called? 
- Twice.

35:08.592 --> 35:11.412
She left a message last night and she called again a minute ago

35:11.663 --> 35:15.451
just to make sure I got it. I tell you, that is one responsible kid.

35:15.601 --> 35:17.064
- She called you? 
- Twice.

35:18.278 --> 35:20.085
She called you, she called Lorelai.

35:20.214 --> 35:21.125
Is everything okay?

35:21.350 --> 35:22.568
Everything's fine.

35:23.791 --> 35:25.550
- I'm going home. 
- Okay.

35:45.783 --> 35:47.738
Let's not stray too far from the coffee cart.

35:47.841 --> 35:49.397
I can barely feel my feet this morning.

35:49.684 --> 35:51.312
The floor wasn't too comfortable, huh?

35:51.492 --> 35:54.047
No, tit was fine until Paris came home and stepped on my face.

35:54.340 --> 35:56.213
The stepping on my face wasn't too comfortable.

35:56.457 --> 35:58.445
At least Paris doesn't tend to wear heels.

35:58.798 --> 35:59.986
Where was she so late?

36:00.288 --> 36:03.130
I don't know, Paris's business is Paris's business.

36:03.734 --> 36:04.953
I wish I lived in a dorm.

36:05.280 --> 36:06.473
Hey, have you called your mother yet?

36:06.616 --> 36:07.369
Nope.

36:07.702 --> 36:10.902
Oh good, because the longer you wait, the easier it's going to be.

36:11.178 --> 36:14.041
I still can't believe she didn't just show up in the middle of the night,

36:14.292 --> 36:16.856
kick down the door, douse the place with holy water.

36:17.066 --> 36:19.344
Maybe she wanted a chance to cool off.

36:19.621 --> 36:21.060
No, that's your mother.

36:21.270 --> 36:23.093
My mother's the kicker and the douser.

36:23.298 --> 36:25.079
No, Mrs. Kim is sending a message.

36:25.329 --> 36:26.329
What message is that?

36:26.902 --> 36:28.806
The message is, "You messed up, kid,

36:28.920 --> 36:31.884
and now you get to sit there and panic about what's gonna happen next,

36:32.067 --> 36:33.965
and while you're panicking thinking about what's gonna happen next,

36:34.031 --> 36:36.236
you get to find your own way home,

36:36.285 --> 36:39.184
cause the Mrs. Kim shuttle van service is closed for business."

36:39.354 --> 36:40.502
So, it's a wordy message.

36:40.834 --> 36:42.360
Everything's so screwed up:

36:42.549 --> 36:44.822
my life, everything I'm doing.

36:45.027 --> 36:45.944
It's not that bad.

36:46.123 --> 36:48.160
It is that bad. I mean, look at this.

36:48.289 --> 36:50.870
Look at where you are, look at what you have.

36:51.085 --> 36:52.722
I'm so jealous you have a life.

36:52.860 --> 36:53.808
You have a life too.

36:53.968 --> 36:55.416
Yeah, just not a very good one.

36:55.533 --> 36:56.363
Lane, come on.

36:56.511 --> 36:58.867
You're healthy, you have a band and a boyfriend,

36:58.995 --> 37:01.103
and so what if school is boring?

37:01.273 --> 37:03.295
You won't be in school forever. You have a good life.

37:03.597 --> 37:04.723
I'm weak.

37:05.743 --> 37:06.910
I have no spine.

37:07.340 --> 37:09.132
If you had no spine you'd be walking funny.

37:09.480 --> 37:11.667
I wanna thank you for letting me crash here last night.

37:11.877 --> 37:13.054
Of course, any time.

37:13.223 --> 37:14.176
I gotta get going.

37:14.594 --> 37:16.423
Do you want to wait till this afternoon?

37:16.547 --> 37:18.318
I can give you a ride home when I'm done with classes.

37:18.573 --> 37:21.282
Now. I have to get home. I have to take care of this.

37:21.481 --> 37:22.967
Okay, come on.

37:23.386 --> 37:24.339
Where are we going?

37:24.579 --> 37:27.601
I can't send you home to Mrs. Kim without a purse full of mini donuts.

37:27.790 --> 37:30.149
You know, I believe that's how Mother Theresa got started.

37:30.554 --> 37:31.885
Really, I heard it was Pixie Stix.

37:43.462 --> 37:44.824
Hey, it's Madeleine Albright.

37:47.614 --> 37:48.454
You know what?

37:48.920 --> 37:50.630
I do not appreciate you calling me that.

37:50.789 --> 37:54.383
In fact, I don't appreciate you talking to me, or about me at all.

37:54.521 --> 37:56.349
- Fine. 
- I know you've been telling the story.

37:56.539 --> 37:57.338
What story?

37:57.542 --> 38:00.301
The laundry room story. Remember the laundry room?

38:00.440 --> 38:02.059
Machines, rinse cycle...

38:02.237 --> 38:03.727
I asked you to get coffee, that's it.

38:03.942 --> 38:06.287
I did not ask you to get married, or say that I loved you,

38:06.446 --> 38:09.621
or ask to have your children. And I'm not stalking you!

38:09.809 --> 38:12.329
It was a complete coincidence that I happened to go into a meeting

38:12.456 --> 38:14.997
that you happened to be in. I had no idea you were there.

38:15.150 --> 38:19.978
And it's hard to ask someone out and it puts you in an incredibly vulnerable position!

38:20.158 --> 38:23.551
So, it's cruel to use that incident as a funny cocktail story.

38:23.649 --> 38:26.531
So from now on, I would appreciate it if you would refrain from telling

38:26.660 --> 38:30.403
the hilarious laundry room incident to anyone, anywhere, ever again.

38:31.211 --> 38:32.661
I wasn't talking about you.

38:34.883 --> 38:35.713
What?

38:36.111 --> 38:37.811
There was this girl from the third floor,

38:37.920 --> 38:40.638
she asked me out like a 100 times. She followed me to class.

38:40.756 --> 38:42.768
She baked me a cake every day for a month,

38:42.906 --> 38:46.198
then she snuck in my window and hid in my closet, covered in whipped cream.

38:46.408 --> 38:49.659
Oh, that is a little … extreme.

38:49.793 --> 38:51.628
I didn't tell anybody about the laundry room.

38:51.901 --> 38:54.318
Well, good.

38:56.227 --> 39:00.221
Do you think that you could maybe not tell anyone this story also,

39:00.575 --> 39:03.580
'cause, that would be great. Thanks.

39:54.023 --> 39:54.981
Is this all?

40:10.296 --> 40:11.186
That's all.

40:13.940 --> 40:14.847
I'm sorry.

40:16.342 --> 40:17.300
About what?

40:17.427 --> 40:18.851
I'm sorry about last night.

40:19.572 --> 40:21.595
I don't want to keep secrets from you.

40:21.918 --> 40:22.799
You don't?

40:23.541 --> 40:27.011
My band had this amazing chance

40:27.115 --> 40:30.202
to play this really famous club last night

40:30.909 --> 40:32.946
and I didn't know how to tell you about it.

40:33.182 --> 40:34.651
I knew you wouldn't approve,

40:34.814 --> 40:37.395
you wouldn't approve of me being in the band

40:37.574 --> 40:39.864
or the music we were playing

40:40.559 --> 40:43.289
and I can't even imagine what you would have said

40:43.395 --> 40:45.976
if I had asked you to let me stay out 'til four in the morning.

40:46.181 --> 40:47.144
I would have said no.

40:47.329 --> 40:49.950
Well, then I guess I could have imagined it after all.

40:50.524 --> 40:51.347
How long?

40:51.671 --> 40:52.576
How long what?

40:52.838 --> 40:54.697
How long … this.

40:56.396 --> 40:58.537
I started it when I was six,

40:59.576 --> 41:04.004
the day you told me the Cookie Monster was one of the seven deadly sins.

41:04.112 --> 41:06.641
- Gluttony. 
- Yes, gluttony.

41:07.128 --> 41:09.524
So, I made you do this?

41:09.656 --> 41:10.661
No, I just...

41:11.997 --> 41:15.908
I want to please you so badly, but I can't.

41:17.019 --> 41:20.097
I mean, look at you, look at what happened last night.

41:20.214 --> 41:24.577
It's not good. I don't want anything like this to ever happen again.

41:25.477 --> 41:27.879
I've been thinking a lot about this, our situation,

41:27.971 --> 41:31.172
and I think I figured out a way to make everything better.

41:31.360 --> 41:32.109
You have?

41:32.236 --> 41:34.985
I don't want to go to Seventh Day Adventist College anymore.

41:36.148 --> 41:39.644
I want to be able to play with my band. I want to be a drummer.

41:40.525 --> 41:43.625
I will happily go to community college, and I will happily live at home

41:43.741 --> 41:47.893
and adhere to your curfew, except on the nights when the band plays or practices.

41:48.104 --> 41:50.617
This way, I can get what I want

41:50.797 --> 41:53.326
and I won't be lying to you or sneaking around.

41:53.448 --> 41:55.061
This way we can both be happy.

41:56.128 --> 41:57.887
Children do not make the rules.

41:59.090 --> 42:04.273
You may… move out and live like that somewhere else.

42:12.951 --> 42:14.503
I think you handled that very well.

42:14.661 --> 42:17.047
- I was so humiliated. 
- You didn't know.

42:17.145 --> 42:20.576
How self-centered am I that I just assumed that he was talking about me?

42:20.709 --> 42:23.134
I would have assumed the same thing, so, incredibly self-centered.

42:23.273 --> 42:26.519
All I know is I can't show my face in International Relations Club again,

42:26.699 --> 42:29.571
or the laundry room, or the dining room, or anywhere.

42:29.678 --> 42:32.808
Hey, if that nut job who jumped out of his closet Reddi-Whipped

42:32.906 --> 42:34.281
is still hanging around, I think you're fine.

42:34.399 --> 42:35.582
- Hey, it's 4:00. 
- So?

42:35.802 --> 42:38.218
- Where are the bells? 
- They... stopped.

42:38.368 --> 42:39.436
What happened?

42:39.694 --> 42:41.757
I don't know, they just haven't been working all day.

42:41.864 --> 42:43.057
Oh. Too bad.

42:43.225 --> 42:44.828
Yeah, ain't it though.

42:45.510 --> 42:47.113
Someone's at the door. Call me tomorrow.

42:47.260 --> 42:48.019
You bet.

42:48.367 --> 42:50.132
- You okay? 
- Yeah, why?

42:50.393 --> 42:51.929
You just sound a little distracted.

42:52.114 --> 42:55.448
Do I? No, I'm good, I just didn't get much sleep last night, that's all.

42:55.549 --> 42:57.387
- Okay, see you later. 
- Bye.

43:00.958 --> 43:01.781
What are you doing here?

43:02.139 --> 43:03.994
Well, funny you should ask.
