00:05.179 --> 00:07.355
So, Mom, how were you able to
save the day?

00:07.398 --> 00:09.139
Actually, I didn't, you did.

00:09.183 --> 00:10.619
You took one look at the map,

00:10.662 --> 00:12.621
and you could see connections
we couldn't.

00:12.664 --> 00:15.885
I knew right then you were
gonna be a scientist, I swear.

00:15.928 --> 00:17.017
Did you...

00:17.060 --> 00:18.540
I did.

00:18.583 --> 00:20.170
Speaking of science,
this is the office calling.

00:20.194 --> 00:21.978
Sorry, hold on two secs.

00:22.022 --> 00:23.762
Hello?

00:25.547 --> 00:28.245
- You did good there.
- We did good.

00:31.205 --> 00:34.251
Danny, I have something
to tell you.

00:34.295 --> 00:38.038
My lymphoma is back and my old
chemo regimen isn't working.

00:40.605 --> 00:41.824
Okay.

00:41.867 --> 00:43.478
I already got third
and fourth opinions

00:43.521 --> 00:46.002
and the only thing left
is clinical trials.

00:46.046 --> 00:51.051
Gaffney has a promising new
drug study I might qualify for,

00:51.094 --> 00:53.096
and they're screening me
for it today.

00:53.140 --> 00:55.490
Does Robin know?

00:55.533 --> 00:57.231
Well, why'd you wait so long
to tell me?

00:57.274 --> 00:59.494
I was married to you, remember?

00:59.537 --> 01:02.192
I know that your first instinct
is to think the worst,

01:02.236 --> 01:03.498
and I'm not going there.

01:03.541 --> 01:06.196
Okay, I just want you
to remember I work here.

01:06.240 --> 01:07.371
All right?

01:07.415 --> 01:09.634
Anything you need, anything...

01:09.678 --> 01:11.941
- I know.
- Do you hear me?

01:11.984 --> 01:14.552
I hear you. Thank you.

01:19.949 --> 01:21.342
Apartment app again?

01:21.385 --> 01:23.213
No go on that place in
River North?

01:23.257 --> 01:24.910
Well, it turns out by
"one bedroom,"

01:24.954 --> 01:26.042
they meant closet.

01:26.086 --> 01:27.498
Pretty fussy for a guy
who's been on

01:27.522 --> 01:30.394
his brother's couch
for a few weeks.

01:30.438 --> 01:32.831
Just saying.

01:32.875 --> 01:35.225
Your patient came in with
shortness of breath,

01:35.269 --> 01:36.748
pleural effusion on
the right side.

01:36.792 --> 01:39.186
EKG unchanged from his previous
trip to the E.D.

01:39.229 --> 01:40.970
The cardiac labs are
mildly elevated.

01:41.013 --> 01:42.406
Diuretics aren't doing enough.

01:42.450 --> 01:43.320
No.

01:43.364 --> 01:45.366
I got it from here, thanks.

01:45.409 --> 01:48.195
Hey, Francis. Kathleen.

01:48.238 --> 01:50.110
I'm worried, Dr. Rhodes.

01:50.153 --> 01:52.155
I heard that.

01:52.199 --> 01:54.592
Bump in the road, Kathleen,
that's all.

01:54.636 --> 01:56.986
So, I am going to admit you,
Francis.

01:57.029 --> 01:58.161
We're gonna do an echo,

01:58.205 --> 01:59.312
we'll tap the fluid off
your lungs,

01:59.336 --> 02:00.685
so you can breathe easier.

02:00.729 --> 02:02.446
And then we're gonna try
a new combination of meds

02:02.470 --> 02:04.274
to help your heart until
a new one's available.

02:04.298 --> 02:05.603
We've been on the waiting list

02:05.647 --> 02:06.952
for over a year.

02:06.996 --> 02:09.781
Any update on when a transplant
might happen?

02:09.824 --> 02:11.435
I'm sorry, but no.

02:11.479 --> 02:15.222
Is there someone we can call?
Let them know our situation?

02:15.265 --> 02:17.833
I'm not checking out yet,
Kathleen.

02:17.876 --> 02:19.878
I've still got big plans for us.

02:19.922 --> 02:22.968
Techs are gonna be by soon,
they'll take you upstairs.

02:23.012 --> 02:24.187
Hang in there, Kathleen.

02:24.231 --> 02:26.276
Thank you.

02:26.320 --> 02:27.471
It's the middle of the winter

02:27.495 --> 02:28.931
and there's a street fair.

02:28.974 --> 02:31.194
South Side gets bad wrap.

02:31.238 --> 02:34.241
Look at that.

02:34.284 --> 02:36.025
What do you think?

02:36.068 --> 02:37.635
Well, I like that
it's strapless.

02:37.679 --> 02:38.897
Yeah?

02:38.941 --> 02:40.092
But it's a summer dress,
it's just gonna sit

02:40.116 --> 02:41.073
in your closet, you know?

02:41.117 --> 02:43.380
You're right.

02:43.424 --> 02:45.687
I'll be back in the spring.
Okay.

02:45.730 --> 02:47.428
Thank you.

02:49.038 --> 02:50.387
What's up?

02:50.431 --> 02:54.304
It's Philip, another
long night with baby Sophie.

02:54.348 --> 02:57.002
Whoa. You gave him your number?

02:57.046 --> 02:59.483
He's living out of
a PICU recliner.

02:59.527 --> 03:01.137
I wanted him to know
he's not alone.

03:01.181 --> 03:04.662
You're his daughter's doctor,
you're crossing boundaries.

03:04.706 --> 03:06.186
You know what?

03:06.229 --> 03:07.641
I don't think you're qualified
to lecture about boundaries

03:07.665 --> 03:10.494
after you gave your kidney to
someone who you barely know.

03:10.538 --> 03:11.582
Okay?

03:11.626 --> 03:12.907
You're throwing that back at me?

03:12.931 --> 03:14.731
You're the one who started
pointing fingers.

03:19.286 --> 03:21.723
What's happening?

03:23.072 --> 03:24.682
Natalie, watch out!

03:26.000 --> 03:32.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:37.217 --> 03:39.393
It's gonna be okay.

03:39.436 --> 03:42.222
Hang in there.

03:42.265 --> 03:44.136
My God.

04:06.811 --> 04:08.857
Get a half-inch line
on the crashed vehicle

04:08.900 --> 04:13.035
in case it goes up,
and have PD set up a perimeter.

04:13.078 --> 04:14.254
- Boden.
- Hey.

04:14.297 --> 04:15.864
We've got red tags all over
the place

04:15.907 --> 04:18.257
and more trampled victims
than we can count.

04:18.301 --> 04:19.389
We triggered a plan 3;

04:19.433 --> 04:21.565
Response teams are en route,
ten ambos.

04:21.608 --> 04:23.567
- You okay?
- Coping.

04:23.611 --> 04:25.395
- Maggie, I need help.
- Coming.

04:25.439 --> 04:26.831
Open tib-fib fracture.

04:26.875 --> 04:28.659
No pulse in the foot,
I need to reduce it.

04:28.703 --> 04:30.313
All right.
Sir, look at me, look at me.

04:30.357 --> 04:32.097
This is gonna hurt.

04:32.141 --> 04:33.577
One... two...

04:34.839 --> 04:36.754
Got it.

04:36.798 --> 04:39.061
- You got a pulse?
- Yeah.

04:39.104 --> 04:41.455
Okay, okay.

04:41.498 --> 04:42.738
They're gonna take care of you.

04:45.850 --> 04:47.678
There are more ambos on the way,

04:47.722 --> 04:50.072
but it's not gonna be enough.

04:50.115 --> 04:51.832
As long as we get
the red tags to the E.D.,

04:51.856 --> 04:53.443
we should be able to manage
the yellow tags

04:53.467 --> 04:54.685
until reinforcement gets here.

04:54.729 --> 04:57.297
Natalie, not outside,
it's too cold.

04:57.340 --> 04:59.342
What about that?

04:59.386 --> 05:01.083
Get the victims ready to move.

05:02.432 --> 05:03.651
Who's the manager?

05:03.694 --> 05:05.130
That's me.

05:05.174 --> 05:06.697
I'm a doctor, we need your place

05:06.741 --> 05:07.698
to treat the injured.

05:07.742 --> 05:10.048
Yeah, I... okayokay.

05:10.092 --> 05:12.224
Everybody, we need to make
some space.

05:12.268 --> 05:13.530
Here, help me.

05:13.574 --> 05:15.184
Come with me.

05:18.274 --> 05:19.319
Move back, move back.

05:21.190 --> 05:22.931
This way.

05:24.715 --> 05:25.803
Monique.

05:25.847 --> 05:27.109
Trauma Bays turned over?

05:27.152 --> 05:28.652
Yeah, one, two, and Baghdad
are ready to roll.

05:28.676 --> 05:29.807
Okay, perfect.

05:29.851 --> 05:30.915
Go help Leah triage
the waiting room.

05:30.939 --> 05:32.219
E.D.'s staying open for
walk-ins.

05:33.245 --> 05:34.638
What do we got?

05:34.682 --> 05:35.963
33-year old female,
got pinned beneath the car.

05:35.987 --> 05:38.076
- Treatment 4.
- Got it.

05:38.120 --> 05:40.252
28-year old male,
dragged by the vehicle.

05:40.296 --> 05:42.037
Treatment 5.

05:43.038 --> 05:44.866
- Baghdad's all yours.
- Yep.

05:44.909 --> 05:47.782
Jada Harris, 18 years old,
GCS 3.

05:47.825 --> 05:49.218
Couldn't get an airway.

05:49.261 --> 05:51.481
Witnesses said she took
a direct hit from the truck

05:51.525 --> 05:52.482
and was thrown.

05:52.526 --> 05:53.764
That's her mom, Jalissa Harris,

05:53.788 --> 05:55.833
got clipped by the truck's
side view mirror.

05:55.877 --> 05:57.724
Ms. Harris, let me take you
to a treatment room.

05:57.748 --> 05:59.315
I'm fine.

05:59.359 --> 06:01.380
My daughter, Jada, she wasn't
breathing in the ambulance.

06:01.404 --> 06:02.512
Our trauma team is treating her.

06:02.536 --> 06:03.928
Let me look at you and then...

06:03.972 --> 06:05.582
No, I need to see her now.

06:05.626 --> 06:07.845
Ms. Harris, Sharon Goodwin,
come with me.

06:07.889 --> 06:09.760
I'll take you to see
your daughter.

06:09.804 --> 06:12.284
Jada just got accepted
to Northwestern.

06:12.328 --> 06:15.810
We were at the fair
celebrating and then this...

06:16.724 --> 06:19.030
I'm in.

06:19.074 --> 06:20.162
There we go.

06:20.205 --> 06:23.426
Hang 2 units of O-neg,
trigger the MTP.

06:23.470 --> 06:25.341
Let's get a chest and pelvis
x-ray.

06:25.385 --> 06:28.388
Hank, get the ultrasound ready.
What are vitals?

06:28.431 --> 06:31.347
BP 75/40, heart rate 133.

06:31.391 --> 06:32.827
All right, everybody clear.

06:36.004 --> 06:38.006
Left side's whited out.
Give me a chest tube.

06:38.049 --> 06:39.399
Scalpel.

06:47.798 --> 06:50.322
My God, my baby.

06:52.455 --> 06:55.502
Aw, man. Okay, okay.

06:55.545 --> 06:58.113
Ultrasound. Ultrasound's ready.

07:00.420 --> 07:03.292
Her belly's full of blood.
I can't fix this here.

07:03.335 --> 07:06.469
Let's page my team,
get her over to the Hybrid O.R.

07:06.513 --> 07:08.079
Let's go.

07:12.519 --> 07:15.260
- I love you, Jada.
- Ms. Harris.

07:15.304 --> 07:17.915
Let them take her to surgery.
I love you.

07:17.959 --> 07:19.439
No.

07:21.223 --> 07:23.138
They're gonna take good care
of her.

07:29.492 --> 07:32.364
Kenneth Baker, 53, GCS 8.

07:32.408 --> 07:35.367
BP's 144/86, pulse 88.

07:35.411 --> 07:37.152
Superficial head laceration.

07:37.195 --> 07:39.067
Hit by the car
or trample victim?

07:39.110 --> 07:41.591
He's the driver,
plowed through half the fair

07:41.635 --> 07:42.742
and wrapped his truck around
a pole.

07:42.766 --> 07:44.202
Unconscious the whole ride over?

07:44.246 --> 07:46.378
Yeah, it might not have been
from the crash,

07:46.422 --> 07:48.076
pharmacy in his backpack.

07:51.688 --> 07:54.561
On my count.
One... two... three...

07:55.649 --> 07:58.608
Accident scene's a war zone,
gonna make a few round trips.

07:58.652 --> 08:00.305
Thanks, Brett.

08:04.571 --> 08:07.530
Breath sounds are good.
Monique, dig in his backpack.

08:07.574 --> 08:09.010
See what he's on.

08:10.533 --> 08:11.969
Pupils are equal and reactive.

08:12.013 --> 08:13.623
I want trauma labs,
a tox screen,

08:13.667 --> 08:14.929
chest and pelvis x-rays,

08:14.972 --> 08:16.210
and send him over to CT
for a pan scan.

08:16.234 --> 08:20.108
A lot of pain meds,
oxycodone, naproxen...

08:20.151 --> 08:22.066
Phenytoin,
that's an anti-epileptic.

08:26.331 --> 08:28.943
If he had a seizure
while driving...

08:28.986 --> 08:31.336
he wouldn't even know
what happened.

08:32.773 --> 08:34.905
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

08:36.124 --> 08:38.126
Hey, down to our last ambo
for a bit.

08:38.169 --> 08:40.345
It's our call who needs
to go now.

08:40.389 --> 08:41.650
Well, this is Grace.

08:41.695 --> 08:42.976
She helped a woman
who had fallen,

08:43.000 --> 08:44.436
but got trampled herself.

08:44.480 --> 08:45.568
Clear head trauma.

08:45.612 --> 08:46.700
Did you get knocked out?

08:46.743 --> 08:48.092
I don't think so,

08:48.136 --> 08:49.529
but everything is
a little blurry.

08:49.572 --> 08:51.879
We got one more spot in
the ambulance, it's yours.

08:51.922 --> 08:53.837
We need to get you to the E.D.
for a head CT.

08:53.881 --> 08:56.318
But I don't have insurance,
I can't afford it.

08:56.361 --> 08:58.450
I understand,
but since you don't know if

08:58.494 --> 09:00.583
you blacked out,
it's best to be overcautious.

09:00.627 --> 09:02.542
I think I feel better already.

09:02.585 --> 09:05.066
I swear, I'm not just saying it.

09:05.109 --> 09:07.155
Okay, hold on to this.

09:09.244 --> 09:11.942
A trip to the E.D. is gonna
cost a fortune.

09:11.986 --> 09:15.163
Look, her GCS is 15,
her pupils are clear,

09:15.206 --> 09:17.774
and she has a good recollection
of the incident.

09:17.818 --> 09:19.559
Let's hold her off for
the next set ambos,

09:19.602 --> 09:20.864
if she even needs one.

09:20.908 --> 09:22.059
Keep an eye on her
and I'll take a second look

09:22.083 --> 09:23.214
at our yellow tags.

09:23.258 --> 09:25.086
Give the spot to one of them.
Okay.

09:29.786 --> 09:32.223
A lot of whispers the driver
was high.

09:32.267 --> 09:35.487
He wasn't, metastatic cancer.

09:36.924 --> 09:40.449
Terminal, what all those meds
were for.

09:40.492 --> 09:44.018
Just extubated, but no one's
told him what happened,

09:44.061 --> 09:45.802
that people have died.

09:45.846 --> 09:47.630
Or that he's responsible.

09:49.284 --> 09:52.983
Getting news like this
can really break someone.

09:54.594 --> 09:56.117
Let me take the lead?

10:01.644 --> 10:03.167
How did it go?

10:03.211 --> 10:05.039
I had to remove
her left kidney, spleen,

10:05.082 --> 10:06.522
and a portion of
her small intestine.

10:06.562 --> 10:09.696
She needed 15 units of blood,
another 15 of plasma.

10:09.739 --> 10:11.088
What about head trauma?

10:11.132 --> 10:13.656
She was too unstable for CT
before surgery.

10:13.700 --> 10:15.615
She's going up for one now.

10:15.658 --> 10:17.617
- You're concerned.
- Yeah.

10:20.141 --> 10:22.186
I'm gonna change and fill in
the mom.

10:22.230 --> 10:24.928
Well, I'd like to be there
when you do.

10:24.972 --> 10:27.452
Jada's all she's got,
she shouldn't have to

10:27.496 --> 10:28.976
go through this alone.

10:32.240 --> 10:33.720
How many people died?

10:33.763 --> 10:35.809
Seven.

10:35.852 --> 10:38.986
But many more are injured.

10:39.029 --> 10:41.989
So, they may die also?

10:42.032 --> 10:44.078
There are likely to be
more fatalities.

10:44.121 --> 10:45.993
I'm very sorry.

10:46.036 --> 10:47.429
Don't be.

10:48.909 --> 10:50.954
They had it coming.

10:50.998 --> 10:55.219
They're trying to deny
our heritage...

10:55.263 --> 11:00.442
All this mixing,
they wanna eliminate us.

11:02.662 --> 11:04.533
"Us"?

11:04.576 --> 11:07.014
The white race.

11:08.276 --> 11:11.671
But before cancer takes me,
I'm taking some of them.

11:14.151 --> 11:19.287
Was hoping for 20,
but day's not over yet.

11:27.643 --> 11:29.471
Okay, everybody clear the scene.

11:29.514 --> 11:31.691
Get back now.

11:31.734 --> 11:33.170
What the hell is going on?

11:33.214 --> 11:34.278
The truck is loaded with
explosives.

11:34.302 --> 11:35.869
We are pulling out
and locking down.

11:35.912 --> 11:37.653
But you can't,
we have victims that

11:37.697 --> 11:38.915
need to go to the hospital.

11:38.959 --> 11:40.197
They have to wait,
nobody in or out until

11:40.221 --> 11:41.657
the bomb squad says it's okay.

11:41.701 --> 11:42.919
How long is that gonna take?

11:42.963 --> 11:44.157
I don't know,
but you have to get inside

11:44.181 --> 11:45.748
and stay away from the windows.

11:45.792 --> 11:47.707
Go, right now. Go.

11:55.192 --> 11:57.151
Two kits,
that's all you could get?

11:57.194 --> 11:58.215
Ambos got pushed off the scene.

11:58.239 --> 11:59.762
I go to them,
I don't get back in.

11:59.806 --> 12:01.633
All right.
Golden hour's almost up.

12:01.677 --> 12:03.723
Our yellow tags are at risk
of becoming reds.

12:08.597 --> 12:09.772
Divide and conquer?

12:09.816 --> 12:10.773
Yeah.

12:10.817 --> 12:12.166
Okay.

12:18.085 --> 12:20.957
Did you get the results of
Jada's head CT?

12:26.006 --> 12:29.139
Diffuse blood throughout
the brain, catastrophic.

12:29.183 --> 12:30.880
She's brain dead.

12:34.841 --> 12:36.756
Have you told her mother yet?

12:38.192 --> 12:41.761
Not yet, but I think
she already feels it.

12:41.804 --> 12:43.763
Let's tell her together.

12:52.728 --> 12:54.599
You're being moved to
the jail ward.

12:54.643 --> 12:56.166
I want the head nurse.

12:56.210 --> 12:58.473
I am the head nurse.

12:58.516 --> 13:00.692
One of those bossy blacks,
aren't you?

13:00.736 --> 13:02.869
That's right.

13:22.889 --> 13:25.326
Just finished the eval on
a walk-in patient.

13:25.369 --> 13:26.544
I'm ready to present.

13:26.588 --> 13:28.764
Okay, let's go take a look.

13:32.072 --> 13:33.856
I know I said I'd put on
the gown,

13:33.900 --> 13:35.747
but then I realized
just because I feel like crap,

13:35.771 --> 13:37.251
doesn't mean I have to look
like it.

13:37.294 --> 13:40.123
I'm more concerned with
your pain than your outfit.

13:40.167 --> 13:41.951
Dr. Choi, Sebastian Lopez.

13:41.995 --> 13:44.345
- Nice to meet you, Mr. Lopez.
- Sebastian.

13:44.388 --> 13:46.826
And I'm sorry for
taking you away from

13:46.869 --> 13:49.393
all the people injured in
the street fair.

13:49.437 --> 13:51.569
I didn't wanna come in, but...

13:51.613 --> 13:52.808
I can't take the pain anymore.

13:52.832 --> 13:54.877
It's likeit's like
I'm getting stabbed.

13:54.921 --> 13:56.792
The pain's confined to
the fight flank.

13:56.836 --> 13:58.228
It's been steady
the last two days,

13:58.272 --> 13:59.882
became severe overnight.

13:59.926 --> 14:01.405
This morning he noticed
his urine

14:01.449 --> 14:02.754
was cloudy and malodorous.

14:02.798 --> 14:05.192
Well, just tell the whole world.

14:05.235 --> 14:06.584
- Fever?
- Low grade.

14:06.628 --> 14:08.717
I'm thinking pyelonephritis.

14:08.760 --> 14:09.979
It fits. Labs?

14:10.023 --> 14:12.590
CBC, CMP, UA, and an ultrasound.

14:12.634 --> 14:14.070
Agreed, run them.

14:14.114 --> 14:15.811
I know it's painful,
but if left untreated,

14:15.855 --> 14:18.074
a kidney infection can lead
to permanent damage.

14:18.118 --> 14:19.162
It's good you came in.

14:19.206 --> 14:22.818
I'm glad I did... now.

14:27.431 --> 14:29.085
Keep me posted, Terry.

14:32.262 --> 14:34.438
My...

14:34.482 --> 14:36.832
Tall, dark, and intense.

14:36.876 --> 14:38.616
Gets me every time.

14:42.664 --> 14:45.058
Amari Moore, 35,
severe blunt force trauma.

14:45.101 --> 14:46.470
Pushed his son out of the way
of the truck,

14:46.494 --> 14:47.887
took the hit for him.

14:47.930 --> 14:49.366
He refused a board and collar,

14:49.410 --> 14:51.127
wouldn't let us take him with
the first wave of ambos.

14:51.151 --> 14:54.110
Barely got him out before
they locked up the scene.

14:54.154 --> 14:56.504
Off duty cop,
could hardly breathe,

14:56.547 --> 14:57.809
still wanted to stay and help.

14:57.853 --> 15:01.204
My son, Andre... where's Andre?

15:01.248 --> 15:02.945
He rode up front,
Stacy's with him.

15:02.989 --> 15:05.121
I think he hurt his arm.
Take care of him first.

15:05.165 --> 15:07.210
I'm staying with you,
but Andre will be safe.

15:07.254 --> 15:08.255
I promise.

15:08.298 --> 15:10.213
On my count,
One... two... three...

15:12.085 --> 15:15.479
Get a second line
and a chest x-ray.

15:15.523 --> 15:16.785
I want my dad.

15:16.828 --> 15:17.917
Andre Moore, 8.

15:17.960 --> 15:19.657
Fell on his arm,
no visible deformities,

15:19.701 --> 15:20.658
doesn't complain of pain.

15:20.702 --> 15:22.051
Where's my dad?

15:22.095 --> 15:23.246
Your dad is with the doctor
right now, honey.

15:23.270 --> 15:24.924
Let me take a look at your arm.
No!

15:24.967 --> 15:26.969
I need him. Dad, where are you?

15:27.013 --> 15:27.970
Hey, hey, hey. How you doing?

15:28.014 --> 15:30.190
I'm Dr. Charles,
tell me your name.

15:30.233 --> 15:31.147
Andre.

15:31.191 --> 15:32.844
Andre, really nice to meet you.

15:32.888 --> 15:35.064
How 'bout I take you to where

15:35.108 --> 15:37.545
we can see what's going on
with your dad?

15:37.588 --> 15:38.676
- Okay?
- Okay.

15:38.720 --> 15:39.851
Okay. T-2, right?

15:39.895 --> 15:42.115
- Yep.
- Okay, come on.

15:44.682 --> 15:45.901
Dad?

15:45.945 --> 15:47.357
Okay, okay, you can see him
right here.

15:47.381 --> 15:48.773
Okay?

15:49.905 --> 15:51.298
What are they doing?

15:51.341 --> 15:52.560
Well, they're helping him.

15:52.603 --> 15:54.127
You see the plastic mask
over his nose?

15:54.170 --> 15:56.259
That's to help him
breathe easier.

15:56.303 --> 16:00.916
And that machine can actually
look inside his chest.

16:02.048 --> 16:04.485
It's got x-ray vision
just like Superman.

16:06.835 --> 16:10.926
Now, that woman, she's a very
special kind of doctor.

16:10.970 --> 16:13.537
If they find something
in his chest,

16:13.581 --> 16:15.278
she's trained to fix it.

16:19.413 --> 16:22.546
What are they doing?
Where are they taking him?

16:22.590 --> 16:24.984
Dad, where are you going?

16:25.027 --> 16:26.681
I have to go upstairs with
the doctor.

16:26.724 --> 16:28.161
- I wanna go.
- No.

16:28.204 --> 16:30.859
I need you to stay here
and be brave.

16:33.079 --> 16:34.036
Come here.

16:34.080 --> 16:38.388
Andre, I know you're scared...

16:38.432 --> 16:40.434
but I believe in you.

16:40.477 --> 16:44.742
Okay, I can do it.
I'll be brave.

16:44.786 --> 16:46.701
Be brave.

16:46.744 --> 16:47.832
We gotta go.

17:01.411 --> 17:03.370
Not heading home today, am I?

17:03.413 --> 17:05.067
No.

17:05.111 --> 17:08.288
Your echo showed an ejection
fraction rate of 12%.

17:08.330 --> 17:12.422
Your heart is failing
and the meds aren't working.

17:12.465 --> 17:14.424
Ticker's on its last legs.

17:16.470 --> 17:20.560
That's gotta... move me up
the transplant list?

17:21.736 --> 17:23.912
Straight to the top, status 1A.

17:23.954 --> 17:28.047
Well, next in line,
can't beat that.

17:29.483 --> 17:34.140
It's gonna work out, Kathleen,
just like it always has.

17:35.489 --> 17:36.620
'Cause what are we?

17:36.664 --> 17:38.492
Blessed.

17:45.542 --> 17:46.954
I will be back to check on
you guys

17:46.978 --> 17:49.329
in just a little bit, okay?

17:54.899 --> 17:57.380
Ms. Goodwin,
may I have a moment?

17:57.424 --> 18:00.296
Excuse me, Ms. Harris.

18:01.950 --> 18:03.232
I have a patient,
Francis Buckley,

18:03.256 --> 18:05.693
with biventricular heart
failure.

18:05.736 --> 18:09.653
Now, I know that Ms. Harris
has just lost her daughter,

18:09.697 --> 18:11.066
and she hasn't had any time
to grieve...

18:11.090 --> 18:12.787
But Jada's heart could save
his life.

18:12.830 --> 18:14.397
They have the same blood type,

18:14.441 --> 18:17.008
it's the first step towards
her heart being an HLA match.

18:17.052 --> 18:19.489
If it is, with it being
right across the hall,

18:19.533 --> 18:20.838
Francis will get it.

18:20.882 --> 18:23.145
I'll ask her if she'll speak
to the Gift of Hope.

18:23.189 --> 18:24.886
Thank you.

18:34.896 --> 18:39.466
The man who did this...

18:39.509 --> 18:42.338
he didn't even know Jada.

18:42.382 --> 18:44.775
Just wanted to hurt her.

18:44.819 --> 18:46.560
All of us.

18:46.603 --> 18:49.171
Yes, I know.

18:49.215 --> 18:53.088
But there's a way she can
live on...

18:53.132 --> 18:55.438
Through organ donation.

18:57.136 --> 19:00.182
You mean cut Jada up even more?

19:00.226 --> 19:03.098
As if she hasn't already given
enough.

19:03.968 --> 19:07.058
Well, nothing about today
is fair, Ms. Harris.

19:07.102 --> 19:09.931
Not just today.

19:15.241 --> 19:18.200
How does it workdonation?

19:18.244 --> 19:21.812
Well, transplants are
overseen and managed by

19:21.856 --> 19:24.119
an organization called
Gift of Hope.

19:24.163 --> 19:26.948
They'll take over and guide you
through the process.

19:30.125 --> 19:32.388
What will they use from her?

19:32.432 --> 19:37.088
The doctors will make
that assessment.

19:41.092 --> 19:44.574
Just make sure her organs
go to someone like us.

19:50.145 --> 19:52.930
Ms. Harris, I don't have
any control over

19:52.974 --> 19:55.106
the organ donor list.

19:55.150 --> 19:59.110
So, Jada's organs can go to
anyone,

19:59.154 --> 20:02.288
even some racist like the man
who did this?

20:09.991 --> 20:12.080
Then, no.

20:13.473 --> 20:16.258
I can't give permission.

20:26.007 --> 20:27.400
God.

20:27.443 --> 20:28.749
I am so sorry.

20:28.792 --> 20:31.099
Just hold pressure right there,
okay?

20:32.535 --> 20:34.494
My case is down to
a few pieces of gauze.

20:34.537 --> 20:36.365
Yeah, well, more than I've got.

20:36.409 --> 20:38.213
I just flushed shrapnel from
a woman's eye with this.

20:38.237 --> 20:39.281
Help.

20:39.325 --> 20:40.500
He can't breathe.

20:40.543 --> 20:41.999
I'm holding pressure
just like you said,

20:42.023 --> 20:43.764
but he keeps gasping.

20:45.635 --> 20:47.028
Sucking chest wound.

20:47.071 --> 20:48.116
He needs a chest tube.

20:48.159 --> 20:49.291
But we don't have any,

20:49.335 --> 20:50.486
but I saw something that
we can use.

20:50.510 --> 20:51.728
- Yeah?
- Natalie.

20:51.772 --> 20:53.339
Okay, got it.

20:53.382 --> 20:55.993
Look at me, I know you're
uncomfortable right now,

20:56.037 --> 20:57.995
but just try and relax,
keep looking at me

20:58.039 --> 20:59.190
and breathe in nice and easy.

20:59.214 --> 21:00.215
You're gonna be okay.

21:00.259 --> 21:01.738
Plastic wrap and duct tape.

21:01.782 --> 21:04.263
- That should do it.
- Do what?

21:04.306 --> 21:07.178
Every time he breathes in,
air gets in through the wound,

21:07.222 --> 21:08.373
and it gets caught in his chest,

21:08.397 --> 21:09.529
compressing on his lungs.

21:09.572 --> 21:11.182
The plastic wrap reverses it.

21:11.226 --> 21:12.662
It acts as a one-way valve.

21:12.706 --> 21:14.490
It seals the wound
when he inhales

21:14.534 --> 21:18.189
and lets out the air from
the open end when he exhales.

21:22.281 --> 21:24.326
There you go.

21:24.370 --> 21:26.067
Okay, just breathe.

21:26.110 --> 21:27.198
I can breathe better.

21:27.242 --> 21:29.157
Good. Nice job.

21:33.640 --> 21:35.250
You need a break?

21:35.294 --> 21:36.338
Me?

21:36.382 --> 21:38.035
I saw you working out
your shoulder.

21:41.996 --> 21:43.214
Hey.

21:43.258 --> 21:44.898
Dr. Choi, we have to stop
meeting like...

21:45.913 --> 21:48.481
Well, there's the pain again.
So much for being smooth.

21:48.524 --> 21:50.918
So, your labs don't support
a kidney infection.

21:50.961 --> 21:53.399
Student Doctor McNeal has
a new theory

21:53.442 --> 21:54.400
about what's going on.

21:54.443 --> 21:55.401
Do you mind if I take a look?

21:55.444 --> 21:57.272
Well, I thought you'd never ask.

21:57.316 --> 21:59.187
All right, have at it.

22:05.672 --> 22:08.022
I agree,
most likely kidney stones.

22:08.065 --> 22:09.284
How would you confirm?

22:09.328 --> 22:10.566
CT with contrast of
the right ureter.

22:10.590 --> 22:12.069
Perfect, get it going.

22:12.113 --> 22:14.289
We'll figure this out,
get you fixed up.

22:14.333 --> 22:17.510
Dr. Choi, before you go...

22:17.553 --> 22:18.913
How 'bout we grab a drink
sometime?

22:18.946 --> 22:21.296
I'm your doctor,
better if we kept it at that.

22:21.340 --> 22:23.211
Well, that's not exactly a 'no.'

22:25.387 --> 22:27.520
Yep.

22:27.563 --> 22:29.173
You know this...

22:29.217 --> 22:31.480
Hold on a second, Mom.

22:32.612 --> 22:34.614
- Hi.
- Hey, Robin.

22:34.657 --> 22:38.835
Um, thank you for the text.
I didn't know if...

22:38.879 --> 22:40.184
No.

22:50.325 --> 22:54.068
Connor, this is my mom,
Caroline.

22:54.111 --> 22:55.374
Caroline, this is Connor.

22:55.417 --> 22:56.940
Pleasure to meet you, Caroline.

22:56.984 --> 22:59.943
Connor, I have wanted to
meet you for a very long time.

22:59.987 --> 23:02.555
Thank you so much for taking
such good care of my girl

23:02.598 --> 23:03.860
when she needed you.

23:05.079 --> 23:08.256
This is for you,
it's a list of mindless,

23:08.299 --> 23:09.866
but very entertaining apps.

23:09.910 --> 23:11.583
I figured some games might make
the waiting room purgatory

23:11.607 --> 23:13.392
go by a little faster.

23:13.435 --> 23:14.828
Now this gonna be fun.

23:14.871 --> 23:16.917
See, this is what I need
to keep my mind off things.

23:16.960 --> 23:19.789
What are we, chopped liver?

23:19.833 --> 23:22.792
Anyway, now that
you're occupied,

23:22.836 --> 23:25.491
I'm gonna check in with the E.D.

23:25.534 --> 23:27.144
And Mom, we'll be
right over here.

23:29.712 --> 23:33.020
Still saving the day, I see,
and now with a beard.

23:33.063 --> 23:34.195
Change of pace.

23:35.588 --> 23:39.548
Connor, I'm sorry.
I should've stayed in touch.

23:39.592 --> 23:43.378
No, it's okay.
Out of sight, not out of mind.

23:48.427 --> 23:50.080
It's the ICU.

23:50.124 --> 23:52.648
I have a patient with questions
that I don't have answers to.

23:52.692 --> 23:55.390
Look, if there's anything
that Caroline needs,

23:55.434 --> 23:56.435
you just let me know.

23:56.478 --> 23:58.437
And the same goes for you, too.

23:58.480 --> 23:59.873
Thank you.

24:00.961 --> 24:03.354
You know, I'll be in town
for a little while.

24:03.398 --> 24:05.182
Let's catch up.

24:06.923 --> 24:08.229
I'd love that.

24:08.272 --> 24:09.578
Okay.

24:14.453 --> 24:16.237
Sebastian's CT results are back,

24:16.280 --> 24:17.891
mildly dilated ureter.

24:17.934 --> 24:19.849
No evidence of acute
obstruction,

24:19.893 --> 24:21.503
but several stones in
the bladder

24:21.547 --> 24:22.678
causing significant clot.

24:22.722 --> 24:24.680
So you have your diagnosis,
what's next?

24:24.724 --> 24:26.116
IV Ketorolac for the pain,

24:26.160 --> 24:28.249
3-way Foley catheter
to irrigate the clot.

24:28.292 --> 24:29.598
Good.

24:29.642 --> 24:31.731
Ethan, patient in two
has questions about meds.

24:31.774 --> 24:33.080
Let the pharmacy handle it?

24:33.123 --> 24:34.908
Yeah, thanks.

24:34.951 --> 24:39.260
Actually, the pharmacy takes
forever to respond.

24:39.303 --> 24:40.566
I'll speak with the patient.

24:40.609 --> 24:41.567
Okay.

24:41.610 --> 24:42.916
What about Sebastian's Foley?

24:42.959 --> 24:45.005
You're not gonna supervise me?

24:45.048 --> 24:46.267
Grab Nurse Doris.

24:46.310 --> 24:48.110
She's done a thousand more than
I have anyway.

24:50.532 --> 24:52.273
- Ms. Goodwin.
- Yes?

24:52.316 --> 24:55.232
You said that you were gonna
speak to Jalissa Harris

24:55.276 --> 24:57.452
about donating Jada's organs.

24:57.496 --> 24:59.280
I haven't heard from
Gift of Hope.

24:59.323 --> 25:00.629
I did speak with Ms. Harris.

25:00.673 --> 25:03.110
She's not consenting to
organ donation,

25:03.153 --> 25:05.460
because she can't have a say
in who the recipient is.

25:05.504 --> 25:09.203
Well, no one has a say,
that's the whole entire point.

25:09.246 --> 25:10.334
I know.

25:10.378 --> 25:11.660
Francis Buckley is
running out of time.

25:11.684 --> 25:13.120
If he doesn't get Jada's heart,

25:13.163 --> 25:14.861
he might not live long enough
to get one.

25:14.904 --> 25:16.950
I understand, Dr. Rhodes.

25:16.993 --> 25:22.129
But for Ms. Harris,
this has become a racial issue.

25:23.086 --> 25:24.740
Ms. Goodwin, I know that
she is hurting,

25:24.784 --> 25:26.655
but what happened today
was the act of

25:26.699 --> 25:28.570
one, ignorant, violent man.

25:28.614 --> 25:30.659
Yes, but for her,

25:30.703 --> 25:34.794
this decision goes deeper than
one man, one action.

25:34.837 --> 25:37.318
So then what do we do?

25:37.361 --> 25:40.321
I don't know, Dr. Rhodes.

25:40.364 --> 25:42.628
I don't know.

26:04.650 --> 26:07.261
Andre's dad didn't survive
the surgery?

26:11.221 --> 26:12.135
His aunt's on the way,

26:12.179 --> 26:13.528
but she won't be here for hours.

26:13.572 --> 26:16.009
This kid is desperate
for information about his dad.

26:16.052 --> 26:18.359
Did she give us permission
to tell him?

26:18.402 --> 26:20.404
Yeah.

26:23.712 --> 26:25.627
Let's go do it.

26:35.855 --> 26:37.291
Where's my dad?

26:37.334 --> 26:39.119
Sit down a second.

26:40.903 --> 26:44.385
So I gotta tell you something
really sad, okay?

26:44.428 --> 26:46.126
No.

26:46.169 --> 26:48.911
No, he didn't! No!

26:52.306 --> 26:54.700
Dad!

26:54.743 --> 26:58.225
He didn't die! He didn't, no!

27:06.929 --> 27:08.975
There you go.
Thank God, Hermann, supplies.

27:09.018 --> 27:10.890
We literally have nothing left.

27:10.933 --> 27:12.108
This is it?

27:12.152 --> 27:13.806
It's the best I can do
right now.

27:13.849 --> 27:14.957
Any word from the bomb squad

27:14.981 --> 27:16.175
about when the scene's
gonna be cleared?

27:16.199 --> 27:18.680
- Help me!
- Maggie! Maggie, I need help.

27:18.724 --> 27:20.943
- Soon as I know, you'll know.
- All right.

27:24.730 --> 27:26.166
She's seizing.

27:26.209 --> 27:27.297
Damn it.

27:27.341 --> 27:28.361
I should have put her in that

27:28.385 --> 27:29.580
last ambo when I had the chance.

27:29.604 --> 27:31.388
Not on you,
we made a judgement call.

27:31.432 --> 27:33.434
Come on, sweetie.

27:33.477 --> 27:34.609
She stopped seizing.

27:34.653 --> 27:36.282
She's got a pulse,
but she's not breathing.

27:36.306 --> 27:38.918
All right,
there's an airway kit.

27:40.746 --> 27:42.530
- There.
- Yeah.

27:53.019 --> 27:54.716
Got it.

28:12.125 --> 28:14.605
Hey.

28:14.649 --> 28:16.477
Are you okay?

28:17.739 --> 28:21.743
Some days it seems like we do
nothing but give bad news.

28:21.787 --> 28:25.138
I was hoping to see CeCe
before her exam.

28:25.181 --> 28:26.269
Where's Robin?

28:26.313 --> 28:28.445
Getting a bite.

28:28.489 --> 28:30.839
Have you eaten, Daniel?

28:31.797 --> 28:35.104
You know, I keep thinking
about when CeCe and I told

28:35.148 --> 28:36.932
our parents we were engaged.

28:38.151 --> 28:39.650
They were not too happy,
to say the least.

28:39.674 --> 28:41.391
You remember, they didn't even
come to the wedding.

28:41.415 --> 28:43.330
I remember, but it's their loss,

28:43.373 --> 28:45.462
That reception was the bomb.

28:45.506 --> 28:47.726
All of your friends
and CeCe's friends,

28:47.769 --> 28:50.467
it was like the last days
of disco.

28:50.511 --> 28:53.296
More like "Soul Train" with
with a few extra Caucasians,

28:53.340 --> 28:54.776
as I recall.

28:56.125 --> 28:57.953
Long time ago.

28:57.997 --> 29:00.695
You're still not in touch
with your mother?

29:06.135 --> 29:08.659
Cousin told me she is in
a nursing home

29:08.703 --> 29:11.314
around here somewhere,
that's all I know.

29:11.358 --> 29:13.795
I tell you what,
CeCe was as whole lot better

29:13.839 --> 29:16.102
when it came to forgiving
her parents.

29:16.145 --> 29:20.410
I justl couldn't...

29:20.454 --> 29:22.369
I couldn't let it go.

29:24.937 --> 29:27.504
We're all gonna have to let it
go at some point, Daniel.

29:27.548 --> 29:30.072
It'll just go on and on.

29:35.556 --> 29:39.081
Tell CeCe that
I'll come back later.

29:39.125 --> 29:40.691
You bet.

29:45.871 --> 29:47.655
I said no.

29:47.698 --> 29:50.527
I'm not speaking with
Gift of Hope.

29:50.571 --> 29:53.879
I thought you would understand.

29:53.922 --> 29:55.358
I do, Ms. Harris.

29:55.402 --> 29:57.621
I understand you're devastated,
you're angry.

29:57.665 --> 30:00.537
I have every right to be.

30:01.800 --> 30:03.845
Especially today.

30:03.889 --> 30:05.238
Yes, you do.

30:05.281 --> 30:08.894
But please don't let
Jada's legacy be one of hate.

30:08.937 --> 30:11.244
His is.

30:11.287 --> 30:14.029
But it doesn't have to be yours.

30:16.423 --> 30:19.730
Ms. Harris, you have the power

30:19.774 --> 30:22.777
to gift life to someone else.

30:23.909 --> 30:26.172
Please use it.

30:35.268 --> 30:38.271
Baby.

30:48.498 --> 30:49.978
All went well with Sebastian,

30:50.022 --> 30:52.894
Foley's in and he said
he's feeling better already.

30:52.938 --> 30:54.200
Good.

30:54.243 --> 30:56.123
Dr. Lanik's doing
an intraosseous line insertion

30:56.158 --> 30:57.681
in Trauma three,
go check it out.

30:57.725 --> 30:58.987
Okay.

31:02.251 --> 31:04.514
Skipping out on the Foley,

31:04.558 --> 31:06.777
were you confident in my ability

31:06.821 --> 31:09.650
or just uncomfortable Sebastian
was flirting with you?

31:09.693 --> 31:11.106
I would never ask you
to do anything

31:11.130 --> 31:12.827
you're not ready for.

31:12.871 --> 31:17.049
Same time, yeah,
I was kinda relieved

31:17.092 --> 31:18.920
when something else came up.

31:18.964 --> 31:21.096
You know the feeling.

31:21.140 --> 31:22.706
Wouldn't you be a little thrown

31:22.750 --> 31:25.492
by a guy blatantly
hitting on you?

31:25.535 --> 31:29.104
No, I mean, it doesn't
bother me when women do it.

31:29.148 --> 31:31.890
What do you mean?

31:33.630 --> 31:35.197
I thought you knew.

31:36.416 --> 31:39.158
It's no secret in the E.D.,
I'm gay.

31:41.029 --> 31:43.162
No, I wasn't aware.

31:45.512 --> 31:48.080
So, I'm gonna go check in
on Dr. Lanik's

31:48.123 --> 31:50.169
intraosseous line insertion.

32:09.318 --> 32:12.626
Gift of Hope.

32:12.669 --> 32:16.195
Whatever you said, thank you.

32:24.333 --> 32:26.466
My brother was a single dad,

32:26.509 --> 32:29.860
yet never missed
a teacher's conference,

32:29.904 --> 32:32.994
a flag football game,
trick or treating...

32:34.648 --> 32:36.867
I don't know how to
replace that.

32:36.911 --> 32:40.262
You know,
I would really like to help.

32:40.306 --> 32:44.179
I hope that you'll call me.
Anytime.

32:45.920 --> 32:47.400
Really.

32:47.443 --> 32:51.578
Andre, let's go, honey.

32:53.928 --> 32:55.930
What you got there, Andre?

32:57.932 --> 33:00.587
I'm gonna grow up and be brave,

33:00.630 --> 33:02.893
just like my dad.

33:04.417 --> 33:06.549
I think that's a wonderful idea.

33:42.455 --> 33:43.978
Guys, listen up!

33:44.022 --> 33:46.067
Hey, we got the all clear,
all right?

33:46.111 --> 33:49.331
Calvary's rolling in,
dozen ambos, more on the way.

33:49.375 --> 33:51.333
Um, who's going to the hospital?

33:51.377 --> 33:53.074
Everyone, and I'll take a sling.

33:53.118 --> 33:55.294
- All right, you got it.
- Thank you.

33:59.559 --> 34:01.039
We did it.

34:03.302 --> 34:05.217
Maggie, you okay?

34:06.566 --> 34:09.438
- What's wrong?
- I don't know.

34:09.482 --> 34:11.310
My God.

34:11.353 --> 34:12.440
- Natalie...
- Maggie.

34:12.485 --> 34:14.661
NoOh, my God.

34:14.704 --> 34:16.706
Help! I need help.

34:21.449 --> 34:22.886
Maggie, open your eyes.

34:25.063 --> 34:26.455
Wow, what happened?

34:26.498 --> 34:29.545
She had surgery last week,
her incision opened up.

34:29.589 --> 34:31.938
God, she must have been in pain
all day.

34:31.982 --> 34:34.072
All right, let's get her on
a backboard and loaded.

34:34.114 --> 34:37.161
I want IVs in and fluids
running now, let's go.

34:37.205 --> 34:39.120
All right, ready? On my count.

34:39.164 --> 34:41.469
One... two... three...

34:42.645 --> 34:44.386
All right.

34:47.302 --> 34:50.130
- Robin.
- Hey, Ava.

34:50.175 --> 34:52.132
You back working at
the hospital?

34:52.177 --> 34:55.353
No, no, my mom's a patient
here or might be a patient.

34:55.397 --> 34:57.965
Oncology.

34:58.008 --> 35:00.446
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- Yeah.

35:00.489 --> 35:02.317
Have you seen Connor yet?

35:02.361 --> 35:06.060
Briefly, we made loose plans
to get together soon.

35:07.235 --> 35:09.324
It's uncertain times,
so I'm thankful

35:09.368 --> 35:11.196
to have a friend close by.

35:12.197 --> 35:13.633
Anyway, I gotta get back
upstairs.

35:13.676 --> 35:15.243
Of course.

35:18.507 --> 35:20.640
Hey, Terry. Hey, man.

35:20.683 --> 35:23.556
Look, I am sorry for being
such a dope earlier.

35:23.599 --> 35:25.253
Hey, don't worry about it, man.

35:25.297 --> 35:26.472
You didn't know I was gay.

35:26.515 --> 35:27.995
No, still I'm not "that guy."

35:28.038 --> 35:29.518
We're good.

35:29.562 --> 35:32.130
Being an alpha male myself,
I know the difference between

35:32.173 --> 35:35.437
bigotry and being caught
off guard.

35:35.481 --> 35:37.135
- Appreciate that.
- Yeah.

35:37.178 --> 35:38.310
But truth be told,

35:38.353 --> 35:39.852
Sebastian was laying it on
pretty thick.

35:39.876 --> 35:42.836
If I was in your shoes, I might
have been flustered, too.

35:42.879 --> 35:44.664
He's not my type, either.

36:34.148 --> 36:35.236
Where's Mom?

36:35.280 --> 36:37.891
She needed a moment.

36:37.934 --> 36:39.371
Didn't get into the study.

36:39.414 --> 36:42.417
I mean, not the one she wanted
anyway.

36:42.461 --> 36:44.332
Doctor said she was a good
candidate for

36:44.376 --> 36:46.856
this new experimental trial,
but...

36:46.900 --> 36:50.469
It wasn't our first choice,
but it's something.

36:50.512 --> 36:52.253
Yeah, but experimental means
phase one.

36:52.297 --> 36:53.385
You know?

36:53.428 --> 36:54.908
A lot of bugs,
unknown side effects,

36:54.951 --> 36:56.271
dosing problems, safety issues...

36:56.301 --> 36:58.520
Dad, it's okay.

36:58.564 --> 37:01.262
We've beaten cancer before,
we can beat it again.

37:02.307 --> 37:04.526
Mom needs us.

37:04.570 --> 37:06.876
How'd you get so brave?

37:06.920 --> 37:08.661
Come here.

37:08.704 --> 37:10.402
I'm gonna.

37:23.545 --> 37:27.288
Don't tell me,
I popped some stitches.

37:27.332 --> 37:28.855
Yeah.

37:28.898 --> 37:31.901
And you lost a lot of blood,
plus you were dehydrated.

37:31.945 --> 37:33.381
All right.

37:33.425 --> 37:36.297
Go ahead, give me the "I told
you to take it easy" look.

37:36.341 --> 37:38.821
I'm not really one
to gloat today.

37:47.221 --> 37:48.483
Philip?

37:56.361 --> 37:58.014
Go up and see him.

38:01.453 --> 38:04.325
You're not wrong about
crossing boundaries...

38:06.849 --> 38:07.981
but I don't care.

38:11.071 --> 38:12.899
And I love you for that.

38:22.691 --> 38:26.173
Man. His owner...?

38:26.216 --> 38:27.870
Yeah.

38:28.828 --> 38:30.830
So, what?
You just take him to a shelter?

38:30.873 --> 38:35.530
Yeah, but he's an older dog,
so...

38:45.061 --> 38:47.281
I'll take him.

38:47.325 --> 38:49.849
- You sure?
- Yeah.

38:49.892 --> 38:51.459
Hi.

38:56.377 --> 38:58.379
Hey, come on. Let's go, boy.

39:30.063 --> 39:31.630
Hi, Mom.

39:35.373 --> 39:36.939
Daniel.

39:40.595 --> 39:42.118
Do you mind if I sit down?

39:52.215 --> 39:54.914
- It's been so long.
- Yeah.

39:56.959 --> 40:01.834
Um, 30... 35 years.

40:07.622 --> 40:10.451
Why are you here?

40:10.495 --> 40:12.627
I wanna show you something.

40:24.291 --> 40:26.598
This is your granddaughter.

40:26.641 --> 40:29.470
Her name is Robin.

40:41.177 --> 40:43.571
- She's beautiful.
- Yeah.

40:47.009 --> 40:50.926
I would, um... I would very much
like you to meet her.
