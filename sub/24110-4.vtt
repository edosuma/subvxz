00:01.523 --> 00:03.438
My name is Dylan Reinhart.
Not too long ago,

00:03.481 --> 00:05.701
I was an operative in the CIA
known as Agent Reinhart.

00:05.744 --> 00:08.443
When I left the Agency
and started teaching,

00:08.486 --> 00:09.705
I became Professor Reinhart.

00:09.748 --> 00:11.402
I wrote a book
about abnormal behavior

00:11.446 --> 00:13.926
and criminals,
which was so successful

00:13.970 --> 00:16.842
a serial killer used it
as clues for his murders.

00:16.886 --> 00:18.453
That's when the
New York Police Department

00:18.496 --> 00:20.324
reached out to me
to help catch him.

00:20.368 --> 00:22.109
Which I did, so they hired me,

00:22.152 --> 00:23.719
and I became
Consultant Reinhart.

00:23.762 --> 00:25.677
So now I'm working
with this woman,

00:25.721 --> 00:27.331
Detective Lizzie Needham

00:27.375 --> 00:29.638
of the homicide division,
catching killers.

00:29.681 --> 00:31.422
Looks like I need a new name.

Don't they call you

Nope.

All I can say now
is a poisonous gas

I've been on the R Train

03:59.021 --> 04:00.892

04:00.936 --> 04:02.546
I was held in the tunnel

04:04.592 --> 04:06.985
Train ahead of us

Thank you. Get some rest.

So, the passengers
were between stations

04:13.035 --> 04:15.080
for around five times longer
than expected.

That's a lifetime when
you're inhaling toxic fumes.

Unless the killer-- or killers--
delayed the train.

04:57.558 --> 04:59.777
I haven't seen one of these

05:20.363 --> 05:22.713
bunched in front of the doors.

05:22.757 --> 05:25.237
The Walkman was just laying on
the ground not next to anybody,

05:25.281 --> 05:26.326
so I took it.

05:26.369 --> 05:28.197
And a phone from
some guy's hand.

05:45.257 --> 05:47.825
along with all the
other phones from that car.

05:47.869 --> 05:49.261
Anything on the cassette
in the Walkman?

05:49.305 --> 05:50.741
The Walkman was broken,

05:50.785 --> 05:52.482
and finding a working
cassette player around here

05:52.526 --> 05:54.658
may be more challenging
than finding the killer.

05:54.702 --> 05:56.486
If there was a specific target
on the train,

05:56.530 --> 05:58.662
maybe the Walkman could give us
a clue as to why.

05:58.706 --> 06:00.751
Or it could be
a Duran Duran mix tape.

06:00.795 --> 06:02.971
I happen to have a
cassette deck at home.

06:03.014 --> 06:04.581
Oh. In your boom box?

06:04.625 --> 06:05.843
Yes, next to my eight-track.

06:05.887 --> 06:08.106
What's an eightOoh.

06:08.150 --> 06:10.065
So, probably shouldn't ask
who Duran Duran are?

06:10.108 --> 06:11.849
No!
Kidding.

06:13.198 --> 06:15.200
My first Walkman
changed my life.

06:15.244 --> 06:18.421
I used to listen to music
on it all the time.

06:18.465 --> 06:20.118
It was my escape.

06:20.162 --> 06:22.120
Was your childhood

06:22.164 --> 06:24.253
My mother was busy taking care

06:24.296 --> 06:26.603
My father was busy
taking care of his work.

06:26.647 --> 06:28.213
It's not like the
bills weren't paid

06:28.257 --> 06:30.390
or there was no
food on the table.

06:30.433 --> 06:33.828

Okay, listen up, everybody.

06:36.091 --> 06:38.006
There were 12 victims

06:38.049 --> 06:40.791
Seven of the 12 were from out

06:40.835 --> 06:42.880
Still assessing

06:42.924 --> 06:44.621
from every stop on the line,

06:44.665 --> 06:47.885
and no one has claimed
responsibility... yet.

06:47.929 --> 06:50.018
This is being treated
as a terrorist act,

06:50.061 --> 06:52.020
so the FBI will take the lead.

06:52.063 --> 06:54.152
We need to pull together
and sniff out those responsible

06:54.196 --> 06:56.241
and show them

06:56.285 --> 06:58.461
no one gets to do this to us.

06:58.505 --> 07:00.158
Let's get 'em.

07:04.336 --> 07:06.556
No one claimed responsibility.

07:06.600 --> 07:08.558
Terrorists need credit.

07:08.602 --> 07:10.125
They usually aim for
big, splashy targets

07:10.168 --> 07:12.083
with high body counts,

07:12.127 --> 07:14.129
yet this was the last car,
typically the least populated,

07:14.172 --> 07:15.913

07:15.957 --> 07:17.437
not even at rush hour.

07:18.916 --> 07:20.265
Would now be a bad time

07:20.309 --> 07:23.094

not a terrorist attack?

07:23.138 --> 07:24.487
FUCCI:
They unlocked the phone
from the pickpocket.

07:24.531 --> 07:26.707
Belongs to victim Josh Monaz.

07:26.750 --> 07:28.752
Sent a text
from the subway:

07:28.796 --> 07:30.188
"Doors closed
before I could get off.

07:30.232 --> 07:32.669
Meet you at the usual place."

07:32.713 --> 07:34.976

07:35.019 --> 07:36.804
GRACE:
It's horrible.

07:36.847 --> 07:39.937
He was an amazing man,
and we were soul mates.

07:39.981 --> 07:42.157
May I ask why you
didn't come forward?

07:42.200 --> 07:43.724
DYLAN:
Is it because you were

07:43.767 --> 07:44.812
having an affair
with the victim?

07:44.855 --> 07:47.249
Having an affair?
With Josh?

07:47.292 --> 07:49.251
You aren't wearing
a wedding ring,

07:49.294 --> 07:51.688
and all four male victims
were wearing one.

07:51.732 --> 07:53.298
People who want
to hide the truth

07:53.342 --> 07:56.214
tend to gesture toward
themselves, as you have done;

07:56.258 --> 07:57.825
play with their hair,
as you are doing;

07:57.868 --> 08:00.001
and repeat the question
before answering it,

08:00.044 --> 08:01.437

I asked you

08:01.481 --> 08:03.265

affair with the victim.

08:03.308 --> 08:05.441
Oh, and as Detective
Needham mentioned,

08:05.485 --> 08:07.661
you didn't
come forward.

08:09.445 --> 08:11.186
Josh is married,

08:11.229 --> 08:13.275
but not happily.

08:13.318 --> 08:15.103
We were going
to a hotel,

08:15.146 --> 08:16.626
and I didn't want anyone
to find out.

08:16.670 --> 08:18.323
What happened on
the platform?

08:18.367 --> 08:20.717
We were heading
for the train,

08:20.761 --> 08:23.328
and Josh was ahead of me.

08:23.372 --> 08:26.331
And then, suddenly,
this guy appears on my left

08:26.375 --> 08:28.377
and barrels into me
as he passes.

08:28.420 --> 08:29.421
He knocked my bag down.

08:29.465 --> 08:31.336
All of my things
went flying.

08:31.380 --> 08:32.729
What did he look like?

08:32.773 --> 08:34.644
He was skinny, white.

08:34.688 --> 08:37.560
I call out to Josh,
but he's too far ahead.

08:37.604 --> 08:39.301
I look up
to see the guy.

08:39.344 --> 08:40.694
He was wearing
a backpack,

08:40.737 --> 08:42.609
and he gets onto
the same car as Josh.

08:42.652 --> 08:45.525
Just as the doors are
about to close, he hops off

08:45.568 --> 08:47.483
and then jumps
onto another car.

08:47.527 --> 08:51.531
J-Josh tries to hold the doors
open for me...

08:51.574 --> 08:54.229
and...

08:54.272 --> 08:57.406
I grab my things, but...

08:57.449 --> 09:00.888
the doors slam shut,
and the train takes off, and...

09:00.931 --> 09:03.368
that was the last time that I...

09:05.066 --> 09:06.763
I'll never see him again.

09:06.807 --> 09:08.243
Do you remember any more detail

09:08.286 --> 09:09.897
about the guy
who knocked into you?

09:11.289 --> 09:14.292
He... he had a tattoo, uh...

09:14.336 --> 09:15.555
on his forearm.

09:15.598 --> 09:18.383
It was just a blur,

09:18.427 --> 09:20.560
but I think it was a leaf.

09:20.603 --> 09:21.865
Like...

09:21.909 --> 09:24.302
a marijuana leaf.

09:24.346 --> 09:27.567
We are New Yorkers.

09:27.610 --> 09:29.873
: That is why our city
is open for business,

09:29.917 --> 09:32.180
including the subway.

09:32.223 --> 09:34.791
I will be taking the subway
back to city hall,

09:34.835 --> 09:39.056
and I implore my fellow
New Yorkers to do the same.

09:39.100 --> 09:41.276
That's the official
public message,

09:41.319 --> 09:43.800
but FBI and DHS
are still on high alert.

09:43.844 --> 09:46.977
French diplomat didn't have
any apparent enemies.

09:47.021 --> 09:48.413
No one's standing down yet.

09:48.457 --> 09:49.980
That cassette tape
was just a long,

09:50.024 --> 09:51.460
boring lecture about the
history of Central Park.

09:51.503 --> 09:53.288
MAN :
...and the Olmstead Hotel.

09:53.331 --> 09:54.681
Frederick Law Olmstead
served as the park's...

09:54.724 --> 09:56.813
LIZZIE:
And turns out that
victim's mistress

09:56.857 --> 09:59.076
wasn't as much help with
the sketch artist as we'd hoped.

09:59.120 --> 10:00.861
We struck out looking

10:00.904 --> 10:03.254
for a matching marijuana tattoo
in the tattoo book.

10:03.298 --> 10:05.343
Maybe the FBI
had better luck with her.

10:05.387 --> 10:08.042
Speaking of which, there's been
an operational shift overnight.

10:08.085 --> 10:11.001
So, even though we apprehended
a thief and found an eyewitness,

10:11.045 --> 10:12.655
we're being pushed aside?

10:12.699 --> 10:15.440
The Joint Terrorism Task Force
is going to take the lead,

10:15.484 --> 10:17.486
linking with
federal investigators.This is a huge case.

10:17.529 --> 10:20.315
I want to catch
the son of a bitch who did this.

10:20.358 --> 10:22.273
You know it's not my call.

10:23.361 --> 10:24.885
Don't worry.

10:24.928 --> 10:26.669
Very few terrorists
have motives that are

10:26.713 --> 10:29.672
psychologically complex
or individually nuanced.

10:29.716 --> 10:32.022
Religious zealot,
fascist militant...

10:32.066 --> 10:34.068
pretty much
the same guy.

10:34.111 --> 10:35.504
Oh, how boring for you.

10:35.547 --> 10:36.940
I do have something for you.

10:36.984 --> 10:38.681
We thought it was
connected to the subway,

10:38.725 --> 10:40.552
but given the negligible
size of the explosive,

10:40.596 --> 10:41.510
we're ruling that out.

10:41.553 --> 10:43.294
Yay. We get the negligible case.

10:43.338 --> 10:44.687
There was a small explosion

10:44.731 --> 10:46.341
at the Central Park Carousel--
one fatality.

10:46.384 --> 10:47.516
It's yours.

10:50.693 --> 10:52.913
There was an explosion
around 8:30.

10:52.956 --> 10:55.089
Threw this blue horse and
this guy into the air.

10:55.132 --> 10:57.657
Found some explosives
in the carousel area,

10:57.700 --> 10:59.528
and you got some
eyewitnesses over there.

11:02.705 --> 11:04.664
WOMAN:
We were on our morning ride.

11:04.707 --> 11:07.449
We got about
a block north, and boom.

11:07.492 --> 11:09.494
Kathy called 911.

11:09.538 --> 11:10.626
I passed this.

11:10.670 --> 11:12.628
I don't know if it
belonged to the bomber

11:12.672 --> 11:14.717
or if some kid lost it,

11:14.761 --> 11:16.414
but I thought
I'd grab it.

11:16.458 --> 11:18.547
You should give
him a medal.

11:18.590 --> 11:20.636
He rushed in to save
that guy's life.

11:20.680 --> 11:22.812
I just did what
any New Yorker would do.

11:22.856 --> 11:25.554
And, anyway,
it wasn't enough.

11:25.597 --> 11:26.598
What's your name?

11:26.642 --> 11:27.687
Kyle Adams.

11:27.730 --> 11:29.514
Um, I had a father and son

11:29.558 --> 11:31.212
in my carriage
when I heard the explosion.

11:31.255 --> 11:33.301
I, uh...
I'm a hansom cab driver.

11:33.344 --> 11:35.042
The last place a horse should be

11:35.085 --> 11:37.261
is walking around the streets
of New York City.

11:37.305 --> 11:38.567
Shame on you!

11:38.610 --> 11:39.699
We treat our horses better

11:39.742 --> 11:41.439
than most people
treat their dogs.

11:41.483 --> 11:43.311
Not to mention, we hit fewer
pedestrians than bicyclists.

11:43.354 --> 11:44.573
LIZZIE:
If you both don't mind...

11:44.616 --> 11:46.053
Please continue.

11:46.096 --> 11:47.794
Um, I told them
they'd have

11:47.837 --> 11:52.407
to walk the rest of the way,
and I rushed to help the man.

11:52.450 --> 11:54.496
I was too late.
Thank you.

11:54.539 --> 11:56.454
You can all go.

11:56.498 --> 11:58.718
Officer, can we get
this to the lab?

11:58.761 --> 12:00.676
Absolutely.As soon as possible.

12:05.812 --> 12:07.335
Dylan.

12:07.378 --> 12:09.119
Roger.

12:09.163 --> 12:10.642
CIA involved in this?

12:12.383 --> 12:13.776
The Case of the
Merry

12:13.820 --> 12:15.343
Hardly.

12:15.386 --> 12:17.693
I was called in for
the subway incident.

12:17.737 --> 12:19.739
That French diplomat
who died--

12:19.782 --> 12:22.437
he was DGSE,
stationed in Tehran,

12:22.480 --> 12:24.439
and he was
under surveillance by us.

12:24.482 --> 12:27.398
I understand Command Ops
took you off the main event.

12:27.442 --> 12:29.226
I can get you reassigned,

12:29.270 --> 12:32.229
stop you from wasting
your time here.

12:32.273 --> 12:34.362
In fact, I already
made the call.

12:35.667 --> 12:37.582
Hey, it's a big case.

12:37.626 --> 12:39.497
My car's waiting.No, thanks.

12:39.541 --> 12:42.762
ROGER:
Well, figured it
was worth a shot.

12:42.805 --> 12:45.590
At least let me take you
and Andrew to dinner tonight.

12:46.635 --> 12:47.984
I'll check in later.

12:48.028 --> 12:49.507
You look pretty good.

12:49.551 --> 12:52.032
Police work suits you.

12:56.819 --> 12:58.821
Who's that?

12:58.865 --> 13:00.736
That...

13:00.780 --> 13:02.738
is my father.

13:09.440 --> 13:12.052
The vic was Cyrus Bryant.
He was one of my CIs when I

13:12.095 --> 13:13.662
was in narcotics. He'd been
cooperating for a while.

13:13.705 --> 13:15.316
Cyrus had been involved in
the ongoing investigation

13:15.359 --> 13:19.799
into two warring drug dealers
vying for uptown traffic.

13:19.842 --> 13:22.932
Looks like he got hit
and we lost a CI.

13:22.976 --> 13:24.716
DYLAN:
Wouldn't drug lords
just shoot a rival?

13:24.760 --> 13:27.676
Why cause a public spectacle
with an explosion?

13:27.719 --> 13:30.505
There's a hole in the back
of this saddle.

13:31.811 --> 13:34.074
Oh, got something for you.

13:34.117 --> 13:35.771
I love when
this happens.

13:35.815 --> 13:37.555
When what happens?When I might be wrong.

13:37.599 --> 13:38.774
It keeps me on my toes.

13:38.818 --> 13:40.471
Maybe this is
about drugs.

13:40.515 --> 13:42.560
Oh, I give this burst
of humility about three seconds.

13:42.604 --> 13:44.127
Except I don't think
it is about drugs.

13:44.171 --> 13:45.259
Ooh! Two seconds.

13:45.302 --> 13:46.738
I mean, why use an explosive?

13:46.782 --> 13:47.870
And such a small one. No.

13:47.914 --> 13:49.132
Something else is going on.

13:51.004 --> 13:53.702
Don't be mad just because
I disagree with you.

13:53.745 --> 13:54.877
You always
disagree with me.

13:54.921 --> 13:56.400
And I'm not mad.
I'm frustrated.

13:56.444 --> 13:58.794
We had a chance to get
back on the subway case.

13:58.838 --> 14:00.622
You didn't even check
with me before saying no.

14:00.665 --> 14:02.406
My father caught me
off guard.

14:02.450 --> 14:04.278
He loves to get
in my head.

14:04.321 --> 14:07.498
But he still came here to
offer it and to see you.

14:07.542 --> 14:08.891
No, he came here because

14:08.935 --> 14:10.588
a French diplomat died
in the attack.

14:10.632 --> 14:12.373
Maybe he came to
the city for that.

14:12.416 --> 14:14.462
Didn't he come to
the park for you?

14:14.505 --> 14:15.898
Mm, it's not that simple.

14:15.942 --> 14:17.378
Never is with family.

14:17.421 --> 14:18.901
Maybe you can explain it to me.

14:18.945 --> 14:19.989
I'd like to know.

14:20.033 --> 14:22.383
I wrote a book, Freaks,

14:22.426 --> 14:24.820
which was a best seller,
which got me in Peoplemagazine,

14:24.864 --> 14:25.865
which you read three times.

14:25.908 --> 14:27.301
I'm familiar with the book.

14:27.344 --> 14:29.912
I'm not sure my father is.

14:29.956 --> 14:31.827
I don't know if he ever read it.

14:31.871 --> 14:33.916
So ask him.

14:33.960 --> 14:36.223
I'm not sure I want
to know the answer.

14:36.266 --> 14:37.528
You shouldn't wonder.

14:37.572 --> 14:39.487
Just ask. Take control.

14:39.530 --> 14:42.055
If he hasn't read it, let him
know how much it bothers you.

14:42.098 --> 14:44.144
It's not such a big deal.
It's just a book.

14:44.187 --> 14:46.320
I'm gonna go and listen
to that cassette again,

14:46.363 --> 14:48.322
see if I missed anything.

14:52.587 --> 14:55.851
Any leads on the subway case?Uh, not that I've heard,

14:55.895 --> 14:57.548
but since I'm not on it,
I wouldn't know.

14:57.592 --> 14:59.463
Lizzie, we need your help
with Lieutenant Gooden.

14:59.507 --> 15:02.336
Why?Because you're her friend
and you never do anything wrong.

15:02.379 --> 15:04.599
FUCCI: Yeah, you wouldn't stand
in a "ten items or less" line

15:04.642 --> 15:06.949
with 11 items.You're the ultimate
rule follower.

15:06.993 --> 15:07.950
Gee, thanks, guys.

15:07.994 --> 15:09.256
What's wrong?

15:09.299 --> 15:10.431
Lou has locked herself in

15:10.474 --> 15:11.867
the conference room,
closed the blinds

15:11.911 --> 15:13.782
and said she is not
to be disturbed.

15:13.825 --> 15:15.958
So don't disturb her.No, no, no, no, no, no.

15:16.002 --> 15:17.525
We need you to disturb her,
all right?

15:17.568 --> 15:19.222
I'm this close
to having a panic attack.

15:19.266 --> 15:21.007
I've seen him have a panic
attack. It's not pretty.

15:21.050 --> 15:22.704
Why is Lou talking
to Internal Affairs?

15:22.747 --> 15:23.966
Can you go in and find out?

15:27.013 --> 15:28.318
Lizzie?

15:28.362 --> 15:30.930
Fine.

15:36.892 --> 15:38.938
Don't stand there. Move around.

15:44.944 --> 15:47.555
:
I'm so sorry.

15:47.598 --> 15:50.297
You look beautiful.

15:50.340 --> 15:51.820
Thank you.

15:51.863 --> 15:52.995
I just need a veil.

15:53.039 --> 15:54.083
Lizzie, meet Olga.

15:54.127 --> 15:57.086
Olga, Lizzie.
Hi.

15:57.130 --> 15:58.914
I'm at work when
the bridal shop opens,

15:58.958 --> 16:00.394
and I'm still at work
after it closes.

16:00.437 --> 16:02.874
Olga was kind enough
to offer to do my fittings

16:02.918 --> 16:04.789
in our conference room.

16:04.833 --> 16:06.530
Everything okay?

16:06.574 --> 16:08.489
Oh, yeah.
The guys just thought that you

16:08.532 --> 16:10.012
were meeting
with Internal Affairs again.

16:10.056 --> 16:12.449
Again?
Yesterday.

16:12.493 --> 16:15.583
Sally, uh, she wasn't here

16:15.626 --> 16:18.194
on, uh, police
business yesterday.

16:19.195 --> 16:20.675
She's helping me
plan my wedding.

16:22.285 --> 16:25.114
Oh. Okay.

16:26.072 --> 16:27.682
S-Sorry.

16:27.725 --> 16:30.032
Wait, Sal... Sally?

16:31.512 --> 16:32.948
Excuse me, Olga.
Do you mind?

16:32.992 --> 16:34.515
Can you just give us
a minute, please?

16:34.558 --> 16:35.733
Thanks.

16:35.777 --> 16:37.735
You...

16:39.128 --> 16:41.217
You asked Sally?

16:41.261 --> 16:43.089
Because...

16:43.132 --> 16:46.440
being on her third marriage,
she's got more experience?

16:46.483 --> 16:49.921
You've been really swamped,
and you're doing great work.

16:49.965 --> 16:52.098
We are always swamped.

16:52.141 --> 16:54.230
I asked you to help
with my wedding.

16:54.274 --> 16:56.189
I know, but you just went
on a date.

16:56.232 --> 16:58.060
You're finally
moving on.

16:58.104 --> 16:59.540
Finally...

16:59.583 --> 17:00.932
Okay, I get it.

17:00.976 --> 17:03.109
Sorry that I've been a drag.

17:03.152 --> 17:05.241
Lizzie, you haven't,

17:05.285 --> 17:08.549
but you've had
a rough time.

17:08.592 --> 17:10.855
It's not even a year yet
since...

17:10.899 --> 17:12.988
You're afraid I'm too fragile?

17:13.032 --> 17:16.122
I just didn't want to stir up
any more pain for you.

17:16.165 --> 17:17.645
Your wedding should
have come first.

17:17.688 --> 17:19.995
It should have, but it didn't.

17:21.997 --> 17:24.565
Yeah, you're right.
I'm... I get it.

17:24.608 --> 17:26.958
I'm sorry
that I barged in on you.

17:27.002 --> 17:29.048
That dress is
gonna be perfect.

17:39.188 --> 17:40.755
Uh, if you have a beer
that costs

17:40.798 --> 17:41.973
less than $20, I'll take it.

17:42.017 --> 17:43.540
Otherwise, tap water is fine.

17:43.584 --> 17:44.802
:
These prices are criminal.

17:44.846 --> 17:46.978
Oh, immoral.
I would like a triple shot

17:47.022 --> 17:49.111
of your finest tequila,
and could you bring it

17:49.155 --> 17:50.852
as fast as humanly possible,
please?

17:50.895 --> 17:52.114
Right away, sir.
Thank you.

17:52.158 --> 17:53.550
:
Wow.

17:53.594 --> 17:55.161
You know when you, uh,
walk into a place

17:55.204 --> 17:57.163
or just see it and you
have a physical reaction?

17:57.206 --> 17:59.034
Well, um, all this
restaurant is to me

17:59.078 --> 18:01.558
is a repository of
upsetting memories of dinners

18:01.602 --> 18:03.082
with my dear ol' dad.Come on, Dylan.

18:03.125 --> 18:04.431
It's just... it's only dinner.

18:04.474 --> 18:06.085
You're clearly forgetting

18:06.128 --> 18:08.043
the last meal we had
with my dad.

18:08.087 --> 18:10.089
You told him you were
leaving the CIA.

18:10.132 --> 18:12.091
It's-it's... it's the only
thing he ever wanted for you.

18:12.134 --> 18:14.528
But...The only thing he thought that
you both had in common.

18:14.571 --> 18:16.530
Of course he wasn't gonna
react well to that news.

18:16.573 --> 18:20.142
Well, he didn't have to be
so... him about it.

18:20.186 --> 18:21.143
Tonight's gonna be different.

18:21.187 --> 18:22.710
There'll be no bad news.

18:22.753 --> 18:24.929
There'll be no news
at all, and besides,

18:24.973 --> 18:27.802
there is nothing your
father can say or do

18:27.845 --> 18:30.500
that I can't
help you handle.

18:31.545 --> 18:33.503
There you are.Thank you.

18:33.547 --> 18:36.027
Except maybe that.

18:37.072 --> 18:39.030
Welcome back, sir.

18:39.074 --> 18:40.510
What is Lizzie
doing here with him?

18:42.817 --> 18:45.080
I invited Lizzie
to join us, Dylan.

18:45.124 --> 18:47.126
I thought it'd
be nice to have

18:47.169 --> 18:50.129
both of your partners together.

18:50.172 --> 18:51.391
ROGER: Andrew.ANDREW: Roger.

18:51.434 --> 18:53.001
Your father didn't tell you
he invited me.

18:53.044 --> 18:55.917
Nope. He likes to
withhold things.

18:55.960 --> 18:58.180
Heard you gave up law
and bought a bar.

18:58.224 --> 19:00.139
Yes, I did. I, uh...

19:00.182 --> 19:03.011
I needed a less sleazy
work environment.

19:05.448 --> 19:08.408
Lizzie was just telling me
what it's like working with you.

19:08.451 --> 19:10.453
Oh, I hope she didn't overuse
the word, "lackluster."

19:10.497 --> 19:12.455
You don't have
to answer any more

19:12.499 --> 19:14.370
of my father's
questions.

19:14.414 --> 19:16.155
My son is a big proponent
of secrecy.

19:16.198 --> 19:17.199
It's genetic.ANDY : Roger,

19:17.243 --> 19:18.592
how long are you in town for?

19:18.635 --> 19:21.072
Until we can close
the terrorist attack.

19:21.116 --> 19:23.074
It's not a terrorist attack.Ah...

19:23.118 --> 19:25.164
Dylan likes to be a contrarian.

19:25.207 --> 19:26.382
You mean I like to be right?

19:26.426 --> 19:29.516
Well, hop back on the case
and prove it.

19:29.559 --> 19:31.648
My offer still stands.

19:33.737 --> 19:35.739
We have a case.

19:35.783 --> 19:38.089
You know that.Ah, yes.

19:38.133 --> 19:39.613
The Carnage on the Carousel.

19:39.656 --> 19:41.092
Don't do this.

19:41.136 --> 19:42.529
Come back.

19:44.139 --> 19:45.923
Really?

19:47.273 --> 19:49.144
That's why you're here?

19:49.188 --> 19:51.625
Yes, this whole terrorist attack

19:51.668 --> 19:54.149
is a ploy to get me
to lure you back.

19:54.193 --> 19:55.759
It wasn't a terrorist attack.

19:55.803 --> 19:59.850
Don't throw your calling away
on this nonsense.

19:59.894 --> 20:02.201
LIZZIE: Excuse me.

20:02.244 --> 20:04.899
There's a fire at
the Olmstead Hotel and a body.

20:04.942 --> 20:07.423
Do you want to go check it out?Yes, I do.

20:07.467 --> 20:10.426
Sorry to not eat and run,
but we have some nonsense

20:10.470 --> 20:12.167
to attend to.

20:12.211 --> 20:13.690
I'm sorry.
See you.

20:15.779 --> 20:17.781
♪

20:36.017 --> 20:38.149
There's blood on the back
of his head.

20:39.281 --> 20:40.674
Maybe the fire
was just a cover-up

20:40.717 --> 20:42.371
for killing this guy.

20:49.335 --> 20:51.206
DYLAN:
Huh.

20:51.250 --> 20:54.209
They moved the chair
and the couch.

20:55.993 --> 20:59.170
Why go to the trouble
of rearranging the furniture,

20:59.214 --> 21:00.911
ripping this place apart,

21:00.955 --> 21:02.348
only to burn it down?

21:02.391 --> 21:04.698
Maybe it's not
about the body.

21:04.741 --> 21:06.177
We're homicide cops.

21:06.221 --> 21:08.136
It better be about the body.

21:09.703 --> 21:11.835
People destroy things
because they've projected

21:11.879 --> 21:13.446
their self-hatred
onto something outside

21:13.489 --> 21:15.448
which has to be
annihilated.

21:15.491 --> 21:16.797
No other vics?

21:16.840 --> 21:18.494
No one else was found here?
No kids?

21:18.538 --> 21:19.756
No, just this guy.

21:19.800 --> 21:21.280
So, why the kid's robe?

21:29.375 --> 21:30.985
DYLAN:
He destroys a room.

21:34.423 --> 21:36.730
Destroys a carousel horse.

21:36.773 --> 21:38.601
Kid's shoe.

21:39.428 --> 21:41.082
Kid's robe.

21:42.736 --> 21:46.305
Why do all this damage if you're
just gonna kill someone?

21:46.348 --> 21:49.699
Whoever did this wanted
to destroy this place,

21:49.743 --> 21:51.135
much like someone
wanted to destroy

21:51.179 --> 21:52.398
that blue
carousel horse.

21:52.441 --> 21:54.182
Victims may have
been killed,

21:54.225 --> 21:56.489
but I don't think that
was the intention.

21:56.532 --> 21:59.143
I think that horse
and this room

21:59.187 --> 22:01.189
were the actual targets,

22:01.232 --> 22:04.192
and I think these crimes were
perpetrated by the same person,

22:04.235 --> 22:06.194
and I think
he's only just started.

22:12.548 --> 22:14.811
The man who rented out
the Olmstead Suite paid with

22:14.855 --> 22:16.552
a stolen card. They don't
know who the victim was.

22:16.596 --> 22:17.727
Judging from the
footage we viewed,

22:17.771 --> 22:19.163
the killer must have
known his victim

22:19.207 --> 22:21.557
and invited him in,
but he was careful

22:21.601 --> 22:23.254
to keep himself hidden
from the cameras.

22:23.298 --> 22:24.865
Could the vic
have been in on it?

22:24.908 --> 22:26.388
Maybe.

22:26.432 --> 22:27.737
Possible but unlikely.

22:27.781 --> 22:29.652
What I think
is more likely is that

22:29.696 --> 22:32.176
the killer was interrupted
by his visitor,

22:32.220 --> 22:33.613
confronted about
what he was doing,

22:33.656 --> 22:35.876
and he had no choice
but to silence him.

22:35.919 --> 22:37.225
That's an awfully big leap

22:37.268 --> 22:38.400
with zero evidence
to support it.

22:38.444 --> 22:39.532
It is.

22:39.575 --> 22:41.011
But the room wasn't trashed

22:41.055 --> 22:42.883
in the way a rock star
trashes a room--

22:42.926 --> 22:44.450
chaotic and haphazard.

22:44.493 --> 22:46.408
There was a clear order
to how it was damaged,

22:46.452 --> 22:47.583
and the furniture
was rearranged

22:47.627 --> 22:49.106
with a sense
of logic.

22:49.150 --> 22:50.369
The clock
in the room

22:50.412 --> 22:51.587
was damaged at 9:48.

22:51.631 --> 22:52.806
That's when it stopped.

22:52.849 --> 22:54.590
The victim arrived at 9:55.

22:54.634 --> 22:56.200
The only reason
to destroy a room

22:56.244 --> 22:57.419
in the way it was done

22:57.463 --> 22:59.421
is if it had a personal
meaning to him.

22:59.465 --> 23:01.858
If he's internally fragmented,
he projects

23:01.902 --> 23:04.295
all the bad stuff about himself
onto these places--

23:04.339 --> 23:05.340
the carousel, the Olmstead room.

23:05.384 --> 23:06.646
You're gonna
have to get

23:06.689 --> 23:08.256
something more concrete
than that.

23:08.299 --> 23:10.476
Too negligible?Nice one, Lizzie.

23:10.519 --> 23:12.129
How about the robe
and the sneaker?

23:12.173 --> 23:14.001
Both kids' sizes.And the carousel.

23:14.044 --> 23:15.698
All childlike stuff.

23:15.742 --> 23:18.309
He could be the Doogie Howser
of murderers,

23:18.353 --> 23:19.920
but he could
also be an adult

23:19.963 --> 23:22.183
who is destroying
his own memories,

23:22.226 --> 23:23.924
pieces of himself.

23:23.967 --> 23:25.969
"The Doogie Howser
of murderers."

23:26.013 --> 23:28.058
Yeah, gonna need more than that.

23:29.799 --> 23:31.322
Lizzie.

23:31.366 --> 23:32.672
Mm

23:34.456 --> 23:36.327
Is what happened with us
gonna be a problem for this?

23:36.371 --> 23:38.025
Not for me.

23:38.068 --> 23:40.506
It doesn't mean
I've forgotten about it.

23:40.549 --> 23:43.422
I didn't mean
to hurt your feelings.

23:43.465 --> 23:46.425
I'm sure you didn't mean to.

23:46.468 --> 23:48.427
I should get back to work.

23:54.520 --> 23:56.826
You know it's
Lieutenant Gooden's job

23:56.870 --> 23:58.828
to be unimaginative
and irritating?

23:58.872 --> 24:00.221
Yes.

24:01.831 --> 24:03.616
She didn't ask me
to help plan her wedding.

24:03.659 --> 24:05.444
She thought
it'd be hard for you.

24:05.487 --> 24:07.620
Would it?Yes, but that's
beside the point.

24:07.663 --> 24:09.273
Let me make that choice.

24:09.317 --> 24:11.493
Maybe she didn't
want you to have to.

24:11.537 --> 24:14.844
Events, like places, can be
powder kegs for buried emotions.

24:14.888 --> 24:16.498
Lieutenant Gooden
was protecting you

24:16.542 --> 24:18.282
from going through the
anguish of grief again.

24:18.326 --> 24:19.632
Even if you know
you have to move on,

24:19.675 --> 24:21.285
it doesn't make it any easier.

24:21.329 --> 24:22.896
For the record,
it's aggravating sometimes

24:22.939 --> 24:24.506
how smart you are.

24:24.550 --> 24:25.768
Tell me about it.

24:26.987 --> 24:29.511
"Events, like places..."

24:29.555 --> 24:31.295
What about 'em?

24:34.560 --> 24:36.083
I think he was trying

24:36.126 --> 24:37.824
to destroy his
own bad memories,

24:37.867 --> 24:39.478
but why now?

24:39.521 --> 24:41.088
The tattoo.
Mm-hmm.

24:41.131 --> 24:43.394
The girl said the subway suspect

24:43.438 --> 24:45.092
had a tattoo.Yeah, like a marijuana plant.

24:45.135 --> 24:47.050
What looks like cannabis
but isn't cannabis?

24:47.094 --> 24:49.488
I give up.
A maple leaf.

24:49.531 --> 24:51.054
What is Central Park's symbol?

24:51.098 --> 24:52.534
Look how close they all are.

24:52.578 --> 24:54.667
The carousel,
the Olmstead, the subway.

24:54.710 --> 24:57.452
This train leads
right to the park.

24:57.496 --> 25:00.542
All of these.
It's the same guy.

25:00.586 --> 25:03.197
What is he telling us?

25:03.240 --> 25:06.069
The Walkman was damaged,
but maybe it wasn't from age.

25:06.113 --> 25:08.637
Maybe it was from whatever
was released in that subway car.

25:08.681 --> 25:10.421
Maybe the subway attack
wasn't meant to kill people.

25:10.465 --> 25:12.467
Maybe they were just
collateral damage.

25:12.511 --> 25:14.469
Did the FBI ever
share the compound

25:14.513 --> 25:16.427
that was found in that backpack?Nope.

25:16.471 --> 25:18.604
But I know someone
who's still on the case.

25:18.647 --> 25:19.822
He gave me his number

25:19.866 --> 25:22.390
at dinner last night.

25:22.433 --> 25:24.435
I thought we consult
each other first.

25:24.479 --> 25:25.785
Oh, we do?

25:28.309 --> 25:32.008
So... you and your dad.

25:32.052 --> 25:34.489
You and me, we do this
because we can't turn it off.

25:34.533 --> 25:35.795
It's who we are.

25:35.838 --> 25:37.536
My father's the same way,

25:37.579 --> 25:39.581
except in his mind,
saving lives,

25:39.625 --> 25:42.192
protecting people,
exists in a hierarchy.

25:42.236 --> 25:45.761
The more people you save,
the more of a hero you are.

25:45.805 --> 25:47.589
So being a cop
isn't good enough?

25:47.633 --> 25:50.244
Oh, nothing I did
ever was.

25:50.287 --> 25:52.507
First of all, it was
my ability with music.

25:52.551 --> 25:55.597
Then it was because I didn't
like girls the way he did.

25:55.641 --> 25:58.252
Our relationship was like
a series of little threads.

25:58.295 --> 26:02.473
Each day, he'd pull one
until who I was

26:02.517 --> 26:04.998
had all these little holes.

26:05.041 --> 26:06.826
I'm so sorry.

26:08.262 --> 26:10.394
True story.

26:10.438 --> 26:13.180
Do you mind if I call him

26:13.223 --> 26:14.747
See what's in the backpack?

26:16.662 --> 26:18.707
Thank you for asking.

26:25.627 --> 26:26.759
Your father said the chemical

26:26.802 --> 26:28.456
in the subway attack
was chlorine.

26:28.499 --> 26:30.545
A high concentration
could be fatal

26:30.589 --> 26:32.112
within a few minutes
of exposure.

26:32.155 --> 26:34.593
It's also a corrosive gas
that can destroy metal.

26:34.636 --> 26:36.682
He used chlorine
to damage the subway car.

26:36.725 --> 26:38.684
The same way he destroyed
part of that carousel

26:38.727 --> 26:39.902
and the hotel room.

26:39.946 --> 26:41.382
Places.

26:41.425 --> 26:42.992
Had that train
not stopped unexpectedly,

26:43.036 --> 26:45.647
those subway riders
would probably have lived.

26:45.691 --> 26:47.257
You happy now?

26:47.301 --> 26:48.389
Why would I be happy?

26:48.432 --> 26:49.651
You got your wish.

26:49.695 --> 26:51.610
We're back on the subway case.

26:51.653 --> 26:53.176
DOUG:
So, this is weird.

26:53.220 --> 26:55.657
The vic in the hotel didn't die
from smoke inhalation.

26:55.701 --> 26:58.617
The signs point to blunt-force
trauma being the cause of death.

26:58.660 --> 27:00.444
What's weird about that?

27:00.488 --> 27:02.055
His blood panel showed
leptospirosis in his system.

27:02.098 --> 27:03.665
LIZZIE:
What's weird
about that?

27:03.709 --> 27:05.232
DYLAN:
Leptospirosis is a
bacterial infection

27:05.275 --> 27:07.538
that can infect people
who've come into contact

27:07.582 --> 27:09.889
with cattle,
pigs and horses.

27:09.932 --> 27:12.587
There aren't too many cattle
or pigs in New York City.

27:12.631 --> 27:13.632
Horses!
Horses!

27:16.591 --> 27:18.680
We were told you're
friends with Kyle Adams.

27:18.724 --> 27:19.550
Do you know him?

27:19.594 --> 27:21.291
Kyle's not working today.

27:21.335 --> 27:23.685
That's our horse, the blue one--
the one that was blown up.

27:23.729 --> 27:25.513
Is that you?
Uh, no.

27:25.556 --> 27:27.689
This is Kyle's cab.Why isn't he working today?

27:27.733 --> 27:28.690
It's his birthday.

27:28.734 --> 27:30.736
Do you know
where he might be?

27:30.779 --> 27:32.781
No, but he lives
above the stables.

27:36.742 --> 27:37.786
LIZZIE:
Police.

27:37.830 --> 27:40.049
Uh, w-we need to
talk to Kyle Adams.

27:40.093 --> 27:41.398
I gave Kyle the day off.

27:41.442 --> 27:42.617
Are any of your
drivers missing?

27:42.661 --> 27:43.966
Uh, Fritz.

27:44.010 --> 27:45.576
I haven't seen him
since yesterday.

27:45.620 --> 27:47.404
Is he okay?

27:47.448 --> 27:48.710
Is this Fritz?

27:48.754 --> 27:49.842
Oh, my God.

27:49.885 --> 27:51.757
What happened?

27:51.800 --> 27:54.411
We're still piecing
things together.

27:54.455 --> 27:55.717
Does Kyle have any tattoos?

27:55.761 --> 27:58.067
On his forearm. A leaf.

27:58.111 --> 28:00.113
We're gonna need
to see Kyle's apartment.

28:01.636 --> 28:03.551
Look at these.

28:05.814 --> 28:07.033
The crime scenes.

28:07.076 --> 28:08.774
DYLAN: And I'll bet
Kyle was at every one.

28:10.427 --> 28:12.603
Terence Adams.

28:12.647 --> 28:14.780
Kyle's father?

28:14.823 --> 28:16.695
Why do I know that name?

28:19.654 --> 28:22.788
Oh, Terence Adams
led the restoration

28:22.831 --> 28:24.398
of Central Park
in the '80s.

28:24.441 --> 28:26.661
That's whose voice
was on the Walkman.

28:26.705 --> 28:28.619
Kyle's dad.

28:28.663 --> 28:31.100
It didn't belong to a tourist.
It was Kyle's.

28:31.144 --> 28:34.103
Explains Kyle's
connection to the park.Uh-huh.

28:34.147 --> 28:36.497
The city thought
of Mr. Adams as a savior.

28:36.540 --> 28:38.281
Seemed to
have it all.

28:39.587 --> 28:43.417
Until he committed suicide
28 years ago today.

28:43.460 --> 28:44.723
That would explain why now.

28:44.766 --> 28:46.289
Oh.

28:46.333 --> 28:49.771
He killed himself
on Kyle's birthday.

28:49.815 --> 28:51.730
It's the logic of someone
with arrested development.

28:51.773 --> 28:53.079
He's thinking
like a seven-year-old.

28:53.122 --> 28:54.515
The Walkman,

28:54.558 --> 28:56.647
the sneaker, the bathrobe.

28:56.691 --> 28:59.302
They weren't just found
at those scenes.

28:59.346 --> 29:01.391
They were left there by Kyle.

29:02.479 --> 29:03.742
Tributes.

29:03.785 --> 29:05.656
Sacred last memories
with his dad

29:05.700 --> 29:07.658
that now he's letting go.

29:07.702 --> 29:09.138
It's a suicide mission.

29:09.182 --> 29:10.836
Just like his dad

29:10.879 --> 29:12.838
on the very same day,

29:12.881 --> 29:15.623
at the very
same age.

29:15.666 --> 29:17.712
So that's that smell.

29:17.756 --> 29:19.148
It's not horse dung.

29:19.192 --> 29:20.541
It's lawn fertilizer.

29:20.584 --> 29:23.762
With ammonium nitrate--
the same thing

29:23.805 --> 29:25.676
McVeigh used in Oklahoma City.

29:25.720 --> 29:27.548
Kyle's planning
something big.

29:27.591 --> 29:28.941
The question is

29:28.984 --> 29:31.813
Uh, did-did it say
where his father killed himself?

29:31.857 --> 29:33.423
He jumped off
the Brooklyn Bridge,

29:33.467 --> 29:35.164
but Kyle wasn't there
to catch him.

29:35.208 --> 29:37.384
That photo, with the bridge
in the background--

29:37.427 --> 29:38.559
his father's office.

29:38.602 --> 29:40.256
It's my bet that Kyle will want

29:40.300 --> 29:42.781
to destroy that memory, too,
and watch it being destroyed.

29:42.824 --> 29:44.913
We have to get to the bridge
before he blows it up.

29:51.050 --> 29:52.834
Set up a perimeter
at Brooklyn Bridge.

29:52.878 --> 29:54.880
Notify ESU and Bomb Squad.
Let all units know.

29:54.923 --> 29:57.839
Stay off your portables
in Lower Manhattan.

29:57.883 --> 29:59.406
Stay off your portables?
Walkie

29:59.449 --> 30:01.234
Isn't that how the cops
talk to each other?

30:01.277 --> 30:03.323
Radio waves could set off
a bomb and kill us.

30:03.366 --> 30:05.586
I'll find Bomb Squad.I'll look for Kyle.

30:06.413 --> 30:09.459
I think I know where he may be.

30:14.856 --> 30:16.684
What do we got?

30:16.727 --> 30:19.818
Mobilization points set up
at Chambers and Cadman Plaza.

30:19.861 --> 30:21.254
Okay.

30:22.429 --> 30:24.083
Kyle!

30:27.956 --> 30:29.131
I know you.

30:29.175 --> 30:30.437
Yeah, we... met at the carousel

30:30.480 --> 30:32.221
when you tried
to save that man's life.

30:32.265 --> 30:34.223
I know you're
not a killer.

30:34.267 --> 30:37.139
I know that wasn't
part of your plan.

30:37.183 --> 30:39.315
The carousel was bombed
before it opened

30:39.359 --> 30:41.100
to avoid casualties.

30:41.143 --> 30:43.015
The passengers
would've lived

30:43.058 --> 30:46.279
if the train hadn't
gotten stuck in that tunnel.

30:46.322 --> 30:49.108
Even killing Fritz
was an accident, wasn't it?

30:50.326 --> 30:51.937
I-I didn't...

30:51.980 --> 30:53.373
I didn't mean to
kill anybody.

30:53.416 --> 30:54.940
Th-They were just
in the wrong places.

30:54.983 --> 30:56.158
I know.

30:56.202 --> 30:58.769
Tell me about
that last day,

30:58.813 --> 31:01.163
what you did
with your dad.

31:01.207 --> 31:03.426
Check the cars down that block.OFFICER: It's clear!

31:03.470 --> 31:05.907
OFFICER 2: Every car so far
has been cleared.

31:07.517 --> 31:08.867
It was your birthday.

31:12.827 --> 31:16.135
My dad took off work
for my birthday.

31:18.964 --> 31:21.357
I wanted to spend it
in New York City,

31:21.401 --> 31:23.185
do all the things...All the things

31:23.229 --> 31:24.795
that any young kid
from out of town

31:24.839 --> 31:27.189
would want to do in the big city
on his birthday.

31:27.233 --> 31:29.583
Ride the carousel.
Stay in a fancy hotel.

31:29.626 --> 31:34.370
Go on the subway.No, I wanted to walk
across the Brooklyn Bridge.

31:34.414 --> 31:35.763
He didn't.

31:35.806 --> 31:38.244
It was late.

31:38.287 --> 31:40.855
I threw a tantrum.
He took me.

31:40.899 --> 31:43.553
He did everything for me.

31:43.597 --> 31:47.427
He... he was the greatest man
I ever met.

31:49.081 --> 31:50.909
But then later
he went back there.

31:50.952 --> 31:52.519
He said good
night to me

31:52.562 --> 31:53.868
at the hotel.

31:53.912 --> 31:56.610
Said he had to go back
to the office.

31:56.653 --> 31:58.394
It's right downstairs.Yeah, I know.

31:58.438 --> 31:59.874
I-I could
never grow up

31:59.918 --> 32:01.876
to be the man
he wanted me to be.

32:01.920 --> 32:04.618
Yeah, he was a great man.

32:04.661 --> 32:07.490
And he wanted you
to have a great day.

32:08.665 --> 32:11.320
But at the end of it,
he killed himself.

32:11.364 --> 32:12.974
And you know what?

32:13.018 --> 32:17.109
None of that, no matter what
your mind tells you...

32:17.152 --> 32:19.285
none of that was your fault.

32:19.328 --> 32:21.765
It was.I know that you believe

32:21.809 --> 32:24.638
you are destined to become like
your father, but you are not.

32:26.553 --> 32:29.425
You are not
like your father,

32:29.469 --> 32:30.861
and you never will be.

32:32.820 --> 32:34.300
Who are you?

32:34.343 --> 32:35.997
My name's Dylan.

32:36.041 --> 32:37.781
Get ready to see something,
Dylan.

32:37.825 --> 32:39.392
If you press that button,

32:39.435 --> 32:41.568
it won't be just your memory
that you destroy--

32:41.611 --> 32:42.612
or the bridge.

32:42.656 --> 32:44.571
Hundreds of people--

32:44.614 --> 32:47.356
out for a walk,
going to work...

32:47.400 --> 32:49.576
OFFICER:
This one's clear, too!

32:53.275 --> 32:54.929
There! That's it!

32:54.973 --> 32:56.409
Let's go. Over there.The horse trailer!

32:57.758 --> 33:00.152
People who love this city,

33:00.195 --> 33:02.676
who love the park.

33:02.719 --> 33:04.939
Fathers and sons.

33:04.983 --> 33:06.636
And you know what?

33:06.680 --> 33:09.726
Some of them might be
spending a birthday together.

33:09.770 --> 33:12.947
Do you really want
to kill them?

33:12.991 --> 33:15.167
That is not who you are, Kyle.

33:15.210 --> 33:17.038
I know it's not.

33:29.355 --> 33:30.834
Kyle, no!

33:51.203 --> 33:52.987
Everyone's safe.

33:53.031 --> 33:55.250
The bomb's defused.

33:55.294 --> 33:57.165
You did well.
So did you.

33:57.209 --> 34:00.386
Had Kyle pulled
that detonator...

34:00.429 --> 34:01.952
I could have saved him.

34:01.996 --> 34:03.563
He's a mass killer.

34:03.606 --> 34:05.565
Losing a parent to suicide
at an early age

34:05.608 --> 34:08.307
can often be a catalyst
for psychiatric disorders.

34:08.350 --> 34:10.265
That is no excuse
for what he did.

34:10.309 --> 34:12.485
I know. The worst thing is--

34:12.528 --> 34:15.662
he thought his father's
suicide was his fault,

34:15.705 --> 34:18.795
that he had made
his father jump.

34:18.839 --> 34:21.015
He was ill, damaged,

34:21.059 --> 34:22.799
just like his dad.

34:22.843 --> 34:25.672
But he spent his whole life

34:25.715 --> 34:29.589
believing he had failed him,

34:29.632 --> 34:32.679
and he just couldn't
move on from that.

34:32.722 --> 34:35.595
Moving on isn't always so easy.

34:35.638 --> 34:37.249
Hasn't been for me.

34:37.292 --> 34:38.685
It wasn't for Kyle,

34:38.728 --> 34:41.601
and look at all
the damage it did.

34:41.644 --> 34:45.213
A dad commits suicide
on his son's birthday.

34:46.910 --> 34:49.696
I think the father's the one
who failed the son.

34:50.740 --> 34:52.394
I heard that
can happen.

34:52.438 --> 34:53.787
True story.

35:06.147 --> 35:07.714
Oh!

35:07.757 --> 35:08.671
Need some help?

35:08.715 --> 35:09.890
Ah, piece of cake.

35:09.933 --> 35:11.631
Okay...

35:11.674 --> 35:13.546
Okay.

35:13.589 --> 35:16.549
Maybe it can now be
your something borrowed,

35:16.592 --> 35:19.160
except you never have
to give it back.

35:19.204 --> 35:20.509
My veil.

35:20.553 --> 35:22.729
What is that, the
world's biggest veil?

35:22.772 --> 35:24.034
It's got my dress in there, too.

35:24.078 --> 35:25.993
Promise, if you hate it,
you'll tell me.

35:26.036 --> 35:27.821
I'm gonna love it.

35:27.864 --> 35:29.866
You know, I went with you to
ten different bridal shops,

35:29.910 --> 35:31.433
then you change your mind
at the last minute

35:31.477 --> 35:32.608
and buy something
on your own?

35:32.652 --> 35:35.829
I was full of surprises... then.

35:37.047 --> 35:39.615
It would have been...

35:41.095 --> 35:43.619
I should have asked you
to help me with my wedding.

35:43.663 --> 35:45.882
And I get why you didn't.

35:45.926 --> 35:47.754
You sure about this?

35:47.797 --> 35:50.713
It's been down there
gathering dust and self-pity.

35:50.757 --> 35:52.802
Time for it and me to move on,

35:52.846 --> 35:55.501
and I'm glad it'll finally
see the light of day.

35:56.806 --> 35:59.374
You and Dylan saved the
day and a lot of lives.

35:59.418 --> 36:00.549
Proud of you.

36:00.593 --> 36:01.811
Thanks, boss.

36:05.511 --> 36:06.816
What

36:06.860 --> 36:07.904
What?

36:07.948 --> 36:09.993
Um...

36:10.037 --> 36:12.257
I hate this veil.What?

36:12.300 --> 36:14.868
It is the single most
stomach-turning thing

36:14.911 --> 36:17.218
I've ever seen, and
I work in homicide.Oh, that...

36:17.262 --> 36:19.873
No, no, no, that is not
my dress or my veil.

36:19.916 --> 36:22.789
Oh, thank God.

36:22.832 --> 36:25.357
The shop must have
sent me the wrong one.

36:25.400 --> 36:28.838
I just never realized it,
'cause I never opened the box.

36:28.882 --> 36:30.840
: Oh, my God.

36:30.884 --> 36:32.451
I could play Aladdin.

36:32.494 --> 36:34.061
Oh, I love it.

36:34.104 --> 36:35.976
I'm wearing that
to your wedding.

36:39.980 --> 36:42.287
ROGER: Very nice of
you to see me off.

36:42.330 --> 36:45.072
I don't get
the chance too often,

36:45.115 --> 36:47.814
and I do have my own agenda.

36:47.857 --> 36:50.904
My book came out
in paperback this week.

36:53.820 --> 36:55.430
Never mind.

36:55.474 --> 36:57.867
If you're trying to get
me to support your sales,

36:57.911 --> 37:01.871
I'm happy to purchase it, but
I already own the hardcover.

37:01.915 --> 37:03.960
Freaks.

37:04.004 --> 37:06.049
A worthy effort.

37:06.093 --> 37:08.530
What do they say?

37:08.574 --> 37:12.142
"Everyone has one
book in them."

37:12.186 --> 37:14.449
I did recognize
myself in there.

37:14.493 --> 37:17.017
Something about
Mother's cancer

37:17.060 --> 37:19.454
and how a loving person
can still be heartless.

37:19.498 --> 37:20.803
I meant it.

37:20.847 --> 37:25.417
Thank you for calling
me a loving person.

37:25.460 --> 37:28.985
The life chose me,

37:29.029 --> 37:33.381
and those who are lucky
to be chosen for this

37:33.425 --> 37:35.209
are meant to abide.

37:35.253 --> 37:37.864
I'm not making that choice.

37:37.907 --> 37:40.910
Don't turn your back on
your gift to spite me.

37:40.954 --> 37:44.653
You've always embraced
your true self.

37:44.697 --> 37:46.960
It's who you are whether
you accept it or not.

37:49.049 --> 37:52.487
Dad, it's who I am whether
youaccept it or not.

37:52.531 --> 37:54.794
I once said those
same words to you,

37:54.837 --> 37:57.144
just in a
different context.

37:58.537 --> 38:01.931
You weren't raised
to think it's okay to quit,

38:01.975 --> 38:03.672
to be a failure.

38:03.716 --> 38:06.893
You cannot turn your back
on your responsibility

38:06.936 --> 38:08.590
for a relationship.

38:08.634 --> 38:11.027
I'm proud of who I am.

38:11.071 --> 38:13.813
Yes, I loved my
work at the Agency.

38:13.856 --> 38:17.382
It was a fascinating,
thrilling, fulfilling life,

38:17.425 --> 38:19.079
if sometimes immoral,

38:19.122 --> 38:21.864
but when I met Andy,
I realized I knew nothing

38:21.908 --> 38:23.953
about a fulfilling life.

38:23.997 --> 38:25.912
That's been his gift to me.

38:25.955 --> 38:29.219
I got where I am,
I've done what I've done,

38:29.263 --> 38:31.352
because I've learned
to sacrifice.

38:31.396 --> 38:33.920
I'm not you.

38:33.963 --> 38:36.966
You're a better case officer
than I ever was.

38:37.010 --> 38:39.055
More clever, more defiant.

38:39.099 --> 38:40.796
If I had your abilities,

38:40.840 --> 38:42.842
I never would have gone
into administration.

38:42.885 --> 38:47.020
You were the case officer
I always wanted to be.

38:53.069 --> 38:54.897
I should go.

38:56.072 --> 38:58.248
Uh, have a safe trip.
