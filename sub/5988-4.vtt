WEBVTT

00:01.302 --> 00:04.336
<i> Previously on</i> Reign...
(gasps)

00:04.338 --> 00:06.739
"One rat down, two to go."

00:06.741 --> 00:09.241
There is also the
matter of a new English
ambassador to France.

00:09.243 --> 00:11.643
I have a nomination.
Lord Robert Dudley.

00:11.645 --> 00:14.246
It's done. Your husband's
the only nomination.

00:14.248 --> 00:15.681
Our loss is France's gain.

00:15.683 --> 00:17.116
ELIZABETH:
What do we do about Amy?

00:17.118 --> 00:18.250
Amy's not going anywhere,
is she?

00:18.252 --> 00:20.519
I don't know. You tell me.

00:20.521 --> 00:23.088
I need you, Nicholas.
What do you want from me?

00:23.090 --> 00:24.690
I've appointed you
the new English ambassador.

00:24.692 --> 00:26.225
If you leave France,
someone else will have

00:26.227 --> 00:27.760
to watch over Charles.

00:27.762 --> 00:29.361
Yes,

00:29.363 --> 00:31.497
someone devoted
to the Valois line.

00:31.499 --> 00:32.398
No.

00:32.400 --> 00:33.699
What are you doing here?

00:33.701 --> 00:35.401
My son has asked me back
into his life,

00:35.403 --> 00:37.236
so here I am,

00:37.238 --> 00:38.504
<i> back in your lives, too.</i>

00:44.045 --> 00:46.111
¶ ¶

00:47.148 --> 00:50.049
(neighing)

00:53.154 --> 00:55.621
I have an urgent message
for Mary, Queen of Scots.

01:05.733 --> 01:07.800
(whispering)

01:09.503 --> 01:11.737
I'm becoming quite the sailor
under your tutelage.

01:11.739 --> 01:13.338
You almost capsized
the boat.

01:13.340 --> 01:14.706
It's a good thing
I'm a strong swimmer, then.

01:14.708 --> 01:15.841
I can keep you afloat.

01:15.843 --> 01:17.443
You always do.

01:17.445 --> 01:18.610
That reminds me,

01:18.612 --> 01:20.579
it is time for your herbs.

01:20.581 --> 01:22.214
They're not herbs.
They're weeds--

01:22.216 --> 01:23.449
weeds that the horses
have watered.

01:23.451 --> 01:24.783
Don't be a child.

01:24.785 --> 01:27.453
The physician said
you need one pastille

01:27.455 --> 01:29.088
every hour.

01:29.090 --> 01:30.722
Take it, and I'll reward you
with a kiss.

01:30.724 --> 01:33.859
Well, I'll take my reward
in advance.

01:39.667 --> 01:41.100
(chuckles)

01:41.102 --> 01:42.501
(groans)

01:42.503 --> 01:44.103
They do seem to be working.

01:44.105 --> 01:46.305
The color
has come back to your face.

01:46.307 --> 01:48.574
And you are feeling better,
aren't you?
I am.

01:48.576 --> 01:50.309
Even if the medicine itself
seems like poison.

01:50.311 --> 01:51.743
Thank you for taking

01:51.745 --> 01:53.479
such good care of me.

01:53.481 --> 01:55.247
I would go
to any lengths, Francis.

01:55.249 --> 01:58.350
Any lengths.

01:59.854 --> 02:01.520
MESSENGER:<i> An urgent dispatch</i>
<i> from your mother.</i>

02:02.590 --> 02:05.124
Wait outside for my reply.

02:06.594 --> 02:08.894
(door opens)

02:08.896 --> 02:11.830
(door closes)

02:11.832 --> 02:13.866
Marie de Guise has become
quite secretive

02:13.868 --> 02:16.135
since returning to power.

02:16.137 --> 02:17.836
My half brother, James,

02:17.838 --> 02:19.838
has been removed
from the regency

02:19.840 --> 02:21.607
by his Protestant supporters

02:21.609 --> 02:23.275
since they discovered,

02:23.277 --> 02:25.277
through his own correspondence,

02:25.279 --> 02:28.447
that he had not cooperated with
Elizabeth's plan to oust me.

02:28.449 --> 02:29.381
My mother is determined

02:29.383 --> 02:31.483
to keep her letters private.

02:31.485 --> 02:34.353
MARIE:<i> Dearest Mary,</i>
<i>I must ask again for your help.</i>

02:34.355 --> 02:35.921
<i> A recent surge</i>
<i> of English forces</i>

02:35.923 --> 02:38.357
<i> has taken control</i>
<i> of the Glen Albyn Pass,</i>

02:38.359 --> 02:40.759
<i> depriving our soldiers</i>
<i> of badly needed provisions.</i>

02:40.761 --> 02:43.495
<i> Unless we can open</i>
<i> a new supply route at sea,</i>

02:43.497 --> 02:45.898
<i> defeat is only</i>
<i> a matter of time.</i>

02:45.900 --> 02:48.901
A surge.

02:48.903 --> 02:51.737
Elizabeth knows of my illness.

02:51.739 --> 02:53.172
She's testing us.

02:54.275 --> 02:55.674
Gather my military council

02:55.676 --> 02:57.609
and the dauphin, now.

03:00.581 --> 03:03.448
WILLIAM:
<i> Your Majesty.</i>

03:03.450 --> 03:06.318
Don Carlos, the Crown Prince
of Spain, has arrived.

03:06.320 --> 03:08.620
He's asked for your
permission to come to court.

03:08.622 --> 03:10.422
Another suitor?

03:10.424 --> 03:11.957
Not just "another."

03:11.959 --> 03:13.859
He is heir to the most
powerful country in the world.

03:13.861 --> 03:17.396
Why must the fate of nations
be decided in a shared bed?

03:17.398 --> 03:19.464
I won't have this
argument again.

03:19.466 --> 03:21.867
The reason you deny your
suitors true consideration

03:21.869 --> 03:23.235
is all too clear:

03:23.237 --> 03:24.770
Robert Dudley.

03:24.772 --> 03:26.805
You needn't worry
about Dudley.

03:26.807 --> 03:28.574
I haven't seen him in weeks.

03:28.576 --> 03:30.876
We have our own reasons
for staying apart.

03:30.878 --> 03:32.711
Then invite Don Carlos
to court.

03:32.713 --> 03:34.813
If you don't, Mary will.

03:34.815 --> 03:37.449
King Francis is dying.

03:37.451 --> 03:39.785
She'll need a new marriage

03:39.787 --> 03:41.220
and a new alliance.

03:41.222 --> 03:45.824
Bring the Spaniard
before me

03:45.826 --> 03:47.893
and we will see.

03:52.633 --> 03:53.899
The bags from my chambers
should go

03:53.901 --> 03:55.400
to Lord Narcisse's carriage.

03:55.402 --> 03:57.469
We're leaving
on our honeymoon today.

03:58.572 --> 03:59.972
Catherine.

03:59.974 --> 04:01.306
You startled me.

04:01.308 --> 04:02.541
Why would my presence
startle you?

04:02.543 --> 04:03.675
Oh, because you married

04:03.677 --> 04:04.943
my lover.

04:04.945 --> 04:06.678
I know you're unhappy about...

04:06.680 --> 04:08.247
Unhappy?

04:08.249 --> 04:10.949
Curious.

04:10.951 --> 04:14.686
Curious to know if you
were pursued by Narcisse?

04:14.688 --> 04:16.355
Or you were
the pursuer?

04:16.357 --> 04:18.523
I swear, I had no intention
of taking him from you.

04:18.525 --> 04:20.025
Mm-hmm.

04:20.027 --> 04:21.526
For the sake of your grandson,

04:21.528 --> 04:23.428
please stop the threats,
the rat.

04:23.430 --> 04:26.431
CATHERINE:
Rat? What do you mean?

04:26.433 --> 04:28.500
The dead rat you left
in my bath.

04:28.502 --> 04:31.970
Dear Lola, many rats skitter
about this castle,

04:31.972 --> 04:33.805
and some may find
their end in tubs.

04:33.807 --> 04:35.540
But not at my command.

04:35.542 --> 04:37.376
But the message in its mouth?

04:37.378 --> 04:38.443
Your rat spoke to you?

04:38.445 --> 04:40.846
A talking rat?

04:40.848 --> 04:42.281
Now I am interested.

04:42.283 --> 04:45.050
Lola! There you are.

04:46.387 --> 04:48.420
It's time for us
to be on our way.

04:48.422 --> 04:50.389
You will excuse us,
won't you?

04:55.996 --> 04:58.297
Catherine is fearless
about taking credit

04:58.299 --> 04:59.598
for the pain she inflicts.

04:59.600 --> 05:00.932
Why deny it?

05:00.934 --> 05:03.735
Well, she's got to be
a bit careful,

05:03.737 --> 05:06.505
now that she's seeking regency
votes from the privy council.

05:06.507 --> 05:08.674
You needn't worry.

05:08.676 --> 05:10.876
I'm not saying she's changed,

05:10.878 --> 05:13.011
but she won't have time
to menace us.

05:13.013 --> 05:14.746
She's got quite
a battle ahead.

05:14.748 --> 05:17.082
And when she does
become regent?

05:17.084 --> 05:19.951
No more talk of Catherine.

05:19.953 --> 05:22.654
All I want to talk about now

05:22.656 --> 05:25.891
is you and me,
with days alone,

05:25.893 --> 05:29.394
far from here.

05:29.396 --> 05:31.463
The further the better.

05:36.403 --> 05:38.003
(court murmuring)

05:41.909 --> 05:43.675
Don Carlos, Prince of Spain.

05:43.677 --> 05:45.911
Your Highness.

05:45.913 --> 05:46.978
You are a vision.

05:46.980 --> 05:48.513
And you a charmer, I see.

05:48.515 --> 05:49.648
Well, I've heard
you've dismissed suitors

05:49.650 --> 05:51.516
before they've even spoken,

05:51.518 --> 05:53.785
but now I know the stories
were missing a vital piece.

05:53.787 --> 05:55.270
And what is that?

05:55.271 --> 05:56.754
That the men had been rendered
speechless by your beauty.

05:56.757 --> 05:58.490
Did they stand before you,
slack-jawed,

05:58.492 --> 06:00.058
nothing but a trap for flies?

06:00.060 --> 06:01.393
Amusing.

06:01.395 --> 06:02.427
Most men don't speak to me

06:02.429 --> 06:03.729
in such a familiar tone.

06:03.731 --> 06:05.464
Well, that's the goal,
is it not?

06:05.466 --> 06:07.099
To familiarize ourselves
with one another?

06:07.101 --> 06:08.500
Tell me this, Elizabeth,

06:08.502 --> 06:10.001
great Protestant queen,

06:10.003 --> 06:11.837
would you ever consider marriage
to a Catholic prince?

06:11.839 --> 06:13.739
Aren't you to the point?

06:13.741 --> 06:15.774
Catholic, Protestant.

06:15.776 --> 06:17.876
In truth, I see
no difference.

06:17.878 --> 06:19.144
There is one Christian God,

06:19.146 --> 06:20.445
the rest are just
bickering clerics,

06:20.447 --> 06:22.447
jockeying for advantage.

06:22.449 --> 06:25.117
The only advantage I care
about is England.

06:25.119 --> 06:27.853
What can Spain offer my country?

06:27.855 --> 06:29.554
Is all of the silver and gold

06:29.556 --> 06:30.889
of the New World
advantage enough?

06:30.891 --> 06:32.391
I should think so.

06:32.393 --> 06:34.459
But it makes me wonder,

06:34.461 --> 06:36.828
what advantage do you see in me?

06:36.830 --> 06:38.096
In truth?

06:38.098 --> 06:40.065
You are a queen,

06:40.067 --> 06:43.668
and as your husband,
I would become king.

06:43.670 --> 06:45.604
I'd like a crown.

06:45.606 --> 06:47.439
I'm tired of waiting
for my father's.

06:47.441 --> 06:51.476
So any queen would meet
your needs?

06:51.478 --> 06:54.813
I hear the queen of Scotland
is in need of a husband soon.

06:54.815 --> 06:56.882
Many queens might meet my needs,

06:56.884 --> 06:59.651
but only you meet my desires.

06:59.653 --> 07:01.520
(court murmuring)

07:04.091 --> 07:06.658
Shall we begin negotiations?

07:06.660 --> 07:08.093
I'll consider it.

07:08.095 --> 07:09.961
Would you care to extend
your stay

07:09.963 --> 07:10.996
at court in the meantime?

07:10.998 --> 07:15.100
I'd enjoy that
immensely.

07:15.102 --> 07:16.935
GENERAL:
Our army has already suffered

07:16.937 --> 07:18.603
many losses on the ground
for Marie de Guise.

07:18.605 --> 07:19.738
Now she asks
for warships?

07:19.740 --> 07:22.607
To secure a supply route.

07:22.609 --> 07:24.709
My mother is confident that
she can drive out the English

07:24.711 --> 07:26.545
if her men are
properly equipped.

07:26.547 --> 07:27.813
But it must be soon.

07:27.815 --> 07:29.448
Marie de Guise is unwell.

07:29.450 --> 07:31.116
If her health falters
before the English are expelled,

07:31.118 --> 07:32.884
Scotland could be left
without a regent.

07:32.886 --> 07:35.153
Mary's throne could fall
into the hands of Protestants--

07:35.155 --> 07:37.989
pawns of Elizabeth
and enemies of France.

07:37.991 --> 07:39.724
Charles,
I asked for you hours ago.

07:39.726 --> 07:41.092
I thought we were meeting
in your chambers.

07:41.094 --> 07:45.497
Naval involvement
is a steep escalation.

07:45.499 --> 07:48.600
Many could die battling
the English at sea.

07:48.602 --> 07:51.169
But hasn't our navy just built
two galleon warships?

07:51.171 --> 07:52.737
They'd easily overpower
the English vessels.

07:52.739 --> 07:55.040
The dauphin is correct.

07:55.042 --> 07:56.708
Prepare the galleons

07:56.710 --> 07:57.909
to set sail immediately.

07:57.911 --> 07:59.611
Your Majesty,
with your condition...

07:59.613 --> 08:00.612
I will not have the world

08:00.614 --> 08:01.847
think that we are weak.

08:01.849 --> 08:03.081
You have your orders.

08:03.083 --> 08:05.617
(group murmuring)

08:06.720 --> 08:08.053
(door opens)

08:08.055 --> 08:09.221
(door closes)

08:09.223 --> 08:11.056
You mustn't strain yourself.

08:11.058 --> 08:12.190
Mary, I am strong.

08:12.192 --> 08:13.892
France is strong.

08:13.894 --> 08:17.162
I won't waste this opportunity
to protect you.

08:22.669 --> 08:23.935
¶ ¶

08:23.937 --> 08:25.770
(laughter)

08:25.772 --> 08:27.138
Greer.

08:27.140 --> 08:28.807
Bash, welcome.

08:28.809 --> 08:29.941
I hear congratulations

08:29.943 --> 08:31.276
are in order.

08:31.278 --> 08:33.078
This place is yours now?
It is!

08:33.080 --> 08:34.513
Pints and girls.

08:34.515 --> 08:35.914
My lease on the
townhouse was up,

08:35.916 --> 08:37.582
and this was for sale, so...

08:37.584 --> 08:39.551
Can I get you an ale
on the house?

08:39.553 --> 08:41.686
Actually, I came to talk to you
about the recent murders.

08:41.688 --> 08:43.555
The killer preys
on the vulnerable.

08:43.557 --> 08:45.023
And I need to caution you
and your girls

08:45.025 --> 08:46.658
to be extremely careful.

08:46.660 --> 08:48.627
Of course.
I share your concerns.

08:48.629 --> 08:50.595
But, on another matter,

08:50.597 --> 08:51.897
and since you're here,

08:51.899 --> 08:53.798
there's someone
you should speak to.

08:53.800 --> 08:56.968
He's been drinking with
Lord Roux for hours.

08:56.970 --> 08:59.804
Trust me, he's not the type
you want around a future king.

08:59.806 --> 09:01.139
CHARLES:
Bash!

09:01.141 --> 09:02.541
Pull up a chair!

09:02.543 --> 09:04.743
Bash!
Thank you.

09:04.745 --> 09:06.077
We are getting
out of here now.

09:06.079 --> 09:07.946
This is no place for you.

09:07.948 --> 09:09.548
(gasps)

09:09.550 --> 09:13.084
What is it?

09:13.086 --> 09:14.653
That looks like a burn,
a bad one.

09:14.655 --> 09:15.820
What happened to you?

09:15.822 --> 09:16.955
Not to me.

09:16.957 --> 09:18.189
To Delphine.

09:18.191 --> 09:19.691
This woman you're looking for?

09:19.693 --> 09:21.893
For some reason now,
I can feel her pain.

09:21.895 --> 09:23.895
And you think someone's
burning her?

09:23.897 --> 09:25.096
Why?

09:25.098 --> 09:27.899
Her healing powers--
they scare people.

09:27.901 --> 09:29.834
And scared people can
do terrible things.

09:29.836 --> 09:32.704
I need to find her

09:32.706 --> 09:34.773
before it's too late.

09:34.775 --> 09:36.942
DUDLEY: You're not seriously
considering this, are you?

09:36.944 --> 09:38.343
Marriage to a Catholic prince?

09:38.345 --> 09:39.844
A Spaniard?

09:39.846 --> 09:41.713
Well, I have to marry someone.

09:41.715 --> 09:42.847
We can be together.

09:42.849 --> 09:44.316
You have a wife, Robert.

09:44.318 --> 09:46.318
We can never be together.

09:46.320 --> 09:47.686
We have been together,

09:47.688 --> 09:50.288
on and off, for years.

09:51.992 --> 09:53.925
I make you happy,

09:53.927 --> 09:55.226
and I can't be apart from you.

09:55.228 --> 09:57.963
Have you forgotten
how close we came

09:57.965 --> 09:59.864
to speaking
of your wife's death?

09:59.866 --> 10:01.866
Thoughts are not deeds,
Elizabeth.

10:04.705 --> 10:07.005
Don't marry Don Carlos.

10:07.007 --> 10:10.675
The nobles will never accept
a woman ruling alone.

10:10.677 --> 10:14.746
Then get the people,
your people, behind you.

10:16.750 --> 10:19.618
Show them the Elizabeth
that I love.

10:19.620 --> 10:21.286
Take your barge up the Thames,

10:21.288 --> 10:23.154
walk around
the streets of London.

10:23.156 --> 10:27.692
Show them your beauty and your
mind and your fierce heart,

10:27.694 --> 10:29.127
and they will
love you.

10:29.129 --> 10:31.129
And once they do,

10:31.131 --> 10:33.632
they won't want some
king's hands around you.

10:33.634 --> 10:36.635
They'll want you
all for themselves,

10:36.637 --> 10:38.770
just like I do.

10:38.772 --> 10:42.040
That's such a lovely idea.

10:42.042 --> 10:45.644
But even if I could sway
the nobles to accept me,

10:45.646 --> 10:48.313
your wife never will.

10:48.315 --> 10:50.849
Amy knows about us.

10:50.851 --> 10:52.283
She knows
the rumors.

10:52.285 --> 10:54.786
If she knows the truth,
she never speaks of it.

10:54.788 --> 10:56.988
She tried to get
you away from me.

10:56.990 --> 10:59.991
She was behind your nomination
for the French ambassadorship.

10:59.993 --> 11:01.926
But how could she be?

11:01.928 --> 11:05.230
It was Lord Lionel who nominated
you, so I had him followed.

11:05.232 --> 11:08.333
Amy had been secretly
meeting with him for weeks.

11:08.335 --> 11:10.335
She's dangerous.

11:10.337 --> 11:12.203
If she could ever
prove our affair,

11:12.205 --> 11:13.805
I would be branded a whore.

11:13.807 --> 11:15.674
No chance of marriage.

11:15.676 --> 11:17.876
Any child I had would be
dismissed as a bastard.

11:17.878 --> 11:20.745
Without the ability to produce
a legitimate heir, I...

11:20.747 --> 11:22.714
You'd be removed
from the throne.

11:22.716 --> 11:24.349
I know.

11:24.351 --> 11:26.418
I will never let that happen.

11:31.024 --> 11:33.024
I love you, Robert,

11:33.026 --> 11:37.429
but this thing between us,
it must end.

11:38.765 --> 11:40.098
You are my queen,

11:40.100 --> 11:43.168
but in this,
I will not obey you.

11:48.141 --> 11:51.042
I will never give up...

11:51.044 --> 11:53.712
on us.

11:53.714 --> 11:55.380
(dog barking, sheep bleating)

11:57.384 --> 11:59.451
Stephan?

12:02.723 --> 12:05.323
Where have you been?

12:05.325 --> 12:07.158
I went to arrange
our meals.

12:07.160 --> 12:09.160
I want everything
to be perfect.

12:09.162 --> 12:10.261
Uh, the kitchen's
in this very building.

12:10.263 --> 12:12.163
Why are your boots muddy?

12:12.165 --> 12:15.500
I also arranged a tour
of the vineyards.

12:15.502 --> 12:17.836
At the crack of dawn?

12:17.838 --> 12:19.170
Well, that way
we get to spend

12:19.172 --> 12:22.040
every available waking
moment together.

12:22.042 --> 12:25.443
And you do seem very
awake right now.

12:26.913 --> 12:28.913
Stephan.

12:28.915 --> 12:30.915
Is there something
you're not telling me?

12:30.917 --> 12:32.484
I'm your husband, Lola.

12:32.486 --> 12:35.220
Have a little faith.

12:37.057 --> 12:39.057
DUDLEY:
<i> Amy, I've come to inform you</i>

12:39.059 --> 12:40.792
that I have made arrangements
for your return home.

12:40.794 --> 12:42.127
Why?

12:42.129 --> 12:43.828
I'm very happy here.

12:43.830 --> 12:45.897
I know about your meetings
with Lord Lionel.

12:45.899 --> 12:47.365
I know that you were
behind his nomination

12:47.367 --> 12:49.000
of me for the
French ambassadorship.

12:49.002 --> 12:51.436
Lord Lionel came to me
suggesting the idea.

12:51.438 --> 12:53.404
I simply agreed you'd
make an excellent envoy.

12:53.406 --> 12:55.039
I know
you meant well.

12:55.041 --> 12:56.875
But your meddling has had
unintended consequences.

12:56.877 --> 12:58.343
It has damaged
my reputation

12:58.345 --> 13:00.478
and this is clearly not
the place for you.

13:00.480 --> 13:01.546
You must leave.

13:01.548 --> 13:02.781
While you stay here?

13:02.783 --> 13:03.915
Yes.

13:03.917 --> 13:05.984
As you wish.

13:19.966 --> 13:21.032
That's enough
for today.

13:22.803 --> 13:23.968
Pick up your sword, Charles.

13:23.970 --> 13:26.304
You're not done yet.

13:26.306 --> 13:27.839
Why do I have to
take these lessons?

13:27.841 --> 13:29.207
Kings don't fight.

13:29.209 --> 13:30.375
Well, God willing,
you'll never have

13:30.377 --> 13:31.810
to draw a blade
in battle, but I did.

13:31.812 --> 13:32.977
And our father did.

13:32.979 --> 13:34.479
And a king must
master skills

13:34.481 --> 13:36.247
in order to gain the respect
of his subjects.

13:43.356 --> 13:44.823
Being king's
a performance.

13:44.825 --> 13:46.958
You need
more practice.

13:46.960 --> 13:48.827
Francis does
seem much better.

13:48.829 --> 13:50.328
Better than he's
been in months.

13:50.330 --> 13:52.330
I brought in a
physician from Austria.

13:52.332 --> 13:54.299
He's trying a new approach
that seems to be working.

13:55.268 --> 13:57.101
(door opens)

13:57.103 --> 13:58.269
CATHERINE:
Tell me something, Francis.

13:58.271 --> 13:59.504
Why take me out of the dungeon

13:59.506 --> 14:00.505
if you don't plan

14:00.507 --> 14:02.140
on seeking
my counsel?

14:02.142 --> 14:03.408
What are you talking about?

14:03.410 --> 14:05.376
The warships that
you sent to Scotland

14:05.378 --> 14:06.911
have been sunk
by the English.

14:06.913 --> 14:09.047
Hundreds are dead.

14:09.049 --> 14:11.616
I could have told you it was
a mistake to send those ships.

14:11.618 --> 14:13.117
The English Navy has
designed a new ship.

14:13.119 --> 14:14.185
They're called frigates.

14:14.187 --> 14:16.955
Smaller, faster,
more agile.

14:16.957 --> 14:18.623
Easily capable of
outflanking our own.

14:18.625 --> 14:22.093
Information you gained plotting
against us at English court?

14:22.095 --> 14:24.095
Would you really have cared
where the intelligence came from

14:24.097 --> 14:26.965
if it had saved your
precious supply route?

14:26.967 --> 14:28.967
I didn't think so.

14:28.969 --> 14:31.469
I won't be so reckless
as regent.

14:31.471 --> 14:32.637
If you don't spend more time

14:32.639 --> 14:34.005
lining up your
privy council votes,

14:34.007 --> 14:35.340
you won't be regent at all.

14:35.342 --> 14:36.941
I'm well aware.

14:36.943 --> 14:38.943
In fact, an influential
member of the council

14:38.945 --> 14:40.378
and dear friend, Lord Clavell,

14:40.380 --> 14:42.280
is coming to
meet with me.

14:42.282 --> 14:43.548
And when
the privy council votes,

14:43.550 --> 14:45.016
I will have
a comfortable majority.

14:45.018 --> 14:46.317
You'd better.

14:46.319 --> 14:48.519
I took you out of the
dungeon for one reason--

14:48.521 --> 14:50.388
to secure my
brother's rule.

14:50.390 --> 14:52.924
And if you can't do that, I'll
put you back in the dungeon

14:52.926 --> 14:54.259
and find a regent who can.

14:54.261 --> 14:55.960
Now leave us.

15:03.436 --> 15:05.103
We shouldn't have
sent those ships.

15:05.105 --> 15:06.537
Men died.

15:06.539 --> 15:08.006
It was a mistake.

15:08.008 --> 15:09.307
Kings make mistakes.

15:09.309 --> 15:11.009
You'll make mistakes.

15:11.011 --> 15:13.011
But this wasn't one.

15:13.013 --> 15:15.446
This was a show of
courage and strength.

15:15.448 --> 15:17.982
The mistake I made was
only sending two ships.

15:17.984 --> 15:19.918
You're going to send more?
MARY: No.

15:21.054 --> 15:22.387
There is another way.

15:25.191 --> 15:27.158
Your Grace, I came
as soon as I...

15:27.160 --> 15:28.593
You sunk our ships.

15:28.595 --> 15:31.529
And still more Englishmen
pour over the border

15:31.531 --> 15:33.398
to spill Scottish blood.

15:33.400 --> 15:36.935
Avenging the English dead,
killed by your mother's forces.

15:36.937 --> 15:40.138
She is under attack.

15:40.140 --> 15:43.174
I have asked you here
to propose a trade.

15:43.176 --> 15:46.477
We have captured two of your
generals-- Hawkins and Gilbert.

15:46.479 --> 15:49.047
We will return them
in exchange for an armistice

15:49.049 --> 15:50.348
along the Glen Albyn Pass.

15:50.350 --> 15:52.483
Allowing your mother
to resupply her armies?

15:52.485 --> 15:55.320
Elizabeth won't cede the
upper hand to Marie de Guise.

15:55.322 --> 15:57.622
I am offering you
a peaceful solution.

15:57.624 --> 15:59.223
Why aren't you interested?

15:59.225 --> 16:01.292
Because those
are not my orders.

16:01.294 --> 16:03.361
And what are your orders?
To wait.

16:03.363 --> 16:06.230
Wait for your mother's
forces to starve,

16:06.232 --> 16:10.635
for the French to tire of dying
on Scottish soil, for...

16:10.637 --> 16:12.270
Francis to die.

16:12.272 --> 16:14.238
Leaving no one to protect you.

16:19.179 --> 16:22.180
I hope your wings are
strong, you vulture.

16:22.182 --> 16:25.116
You will be circling
for quite some time.

16:32.125 --> 16:33.491
Get him out!

16:39.432 --> 16:41.065
Meeting over now,
is it?

16:47.407 --> 16:49.007
CLAUDE:<i> Barely out</i>
<i> of that tower a week,</i>

16:49.009 --> 16:50.308
and you're already
trying to marry me off.

16:50.310 --> 16:51.676
I most certainly am not,

16:51.678 --> 16:53.177
unless you take a liking
to the young man.

16:53.179 --> 16:54.679
Lord Clavell's son?

16:54.681 --> 16:56.681
Lord Clavell is an important
member of the privy council,

16:56.683 --> 16:58.416
and we need to make
a good impression.

16:58.418 --> 17:00.284
You mean,<i> you</i> need to make
a good impression.

17:00.286 --> 17:02.186
So that he'll support
you as regent.

17:02.188 --> 17:04.055
Yes, so that I can support
your spending habits

17:04.057 --> 17:05.390
once I'm running things.

17:05.392 --> 17:07.058
Fine. What do you need?

17:07.060 --> 17:10.395
I've been touring the
old goat around all day,

17:10.397 --> 17:12.263
answering his every
demand, and nothing--

17:12.265 --> 17:14.732
absolutely nothing--
has been good enough.

17:14.734 --> 17:17.668
This dinner is my last
chance to secure his vote.

17:17.670 --> 17:19.771
I simply need your help
to liven things up a bit.

17:21.808 --> 17:23.408
Get ready to
charm, darling.

17:32.752 --> 17:36.287
Lord Clavell, I'm so glad
that you came to visit us

17:36.289 --> 17:39.390
from your château in the
beautiful Loire Valley.

17:39.392 --> 17:41.259
Have you enjoyed
your time at court?

17:41.261 --> 17:43.628
Bed in my chamber is lumpy.

17:43.630 --> 17:46.431
I'm so sorry to hear it.

17:46.433 --> 17:48.566
The trip to the royal aviary,
was that more to your liking?

17:48.568 --> 17:50.535
Floor was littered
with bird droppings.

17:50.537 --> 17:53.171
Most unfortunate.

17:53.173 --> 17:56.507
(Claude giggles)

17:56.509 --> 17:58.509
CLAUDE:
You're so funny.

17:58.511 --> 18:00.511
Forgive my bluntness,

18:00.513 --> 18:04.649
but I have provided you
with all your demands.

18:04.651 --> 18:07.785
You asked for nicer chambers, I
gave you the archbishop's suite.

18:07.787 --> 18:10.621
You requested a five-course
meal, and I present you seven.

18:10.623 --> 18:12.757
How, sir, can I
make you happy?

18:12.759 --> 18:14.625
How can I convince you
to back me for regency?

18:14.627 --> 18:17.261
You can't.

18:17.263 --> 18:20.398
In truth, I only came here
to see how far you would stoop.

18:20.400 --> 18:23.267
It seems you would go so far
as to dangle your daughter

18:23.269 --> 18:26.137
like a common whore.

18:26.139 --> 18:27.872
What wrong have I done you?

18:27.874 --> 18:29.740
You don't remember, do you?

18:29.742 --> 18:31.142
Visiting my home?

18:31.144 --> 18:32.810
Years ago
with the king.

18:32.812 --> 18:35.546
My family came out
to greet you.

18:35.548 --> 18:37.548
We presented you with a gift.

18:37.550 --> 18:41.119
But you deemed it unworthy
of a queen, so...

18:41.121 --> 18:44.255
Your sweet daughter offered me
her dress after I admired it.

18:44.257 --> 18:46.624
She raced inside
to remove the gown,

18:46.626 --> 18:48.626
but you were too impatient.

18:48.628 --> 18:50.128
By the time
she returned,

18:50.130 --> 18:51.662
you were rolling away
in your carriage,

18:51.664 --> 18:54.265
crushing her foot
in the process.

18:54.267 --> 18:55.833
Well, that is horrible.

18:55.835 --> 18:56.834
I had no idea.

18:56.836 --> 18:58.302
You did.

18:58.304 --> 19:00.671
You chided her
for her clumsiness.

19:00.673 --> 19:02.707
You were in a rush.

19:02.709 --> 19:05.243
Her deformity caused her
great pain

19:05.245 --> 19:06.878
and ruined her chances
of marriage.

19:06.880 --> 19:08.880
I apologize sincerely.

19:08.882 --> 19:10.515
Hmm.

19:10.517 --> 19:12.283
And I will meet
with your daughter

19:12.285 --> 19:14.752
and I will help her find a
husband any way that I can.

19:14.754 --> 19:16.387
Where is she now?

19:16.389 --> 19:17.622
She's dead.

19:17.624 --> 19:19.157
Of course she is.

19:19.159 --> 19:20.491
Killed herself a year later,

19:20.493 --> 19:22.560
after yet another suitor
rejected her.

19:22.562 --> 19:24.562
Shall we, Claude?

19:24.564 --> 19:26.731
You do not have my vote.

19:26.733 --> 19:30.201
And you will never
become regent. Never.

19:30.203 --> 19:32.603
(door opens)

19:37.544 --> 19:39.610
Sir Nicholas.

19:47.854 --> 19:49.387
MARY:<i> You're certain</i>
<i> Nicholas intercepted</i>

19:49.389 --> 19:51.255
the letter I sent my mother.

19:51.257 --> 19:52.957
I saw the messenger
hand it over to Nicholas.

19:52.959 --> 19:54.492
He copied the letter
and handed it back,

19:54.494 --> 19:55.826
just as you said he would.

19:55.828 --> 19:57.361
I'm sure he's
already decoded it

19:57.363 --> 19:59.363
and sent it off
to his queen.

19:59.365 --> 20:00.898
How did Nicholas know about
the cipher in the first place?

20:00.900 --> 20:02.934
He's been bribing
one of my servants.

20:02.936 --> 20:05.203
Once I found that out,

20:05.205 --> 20:07.572
I simply allowed the servant
to observe me using it.
Hopefully, Elizabeth

20:07.574 --> 20:08.906
will send her troops
in the wrong direction,

20:08.908 --> 20:10.942
and your mother can
reopen her supply route.

20:10.944 --> 20:12.343
Do you think it will work?

20:12.345 --> 20:14.679
It has to.

20:14.681 --> 20:17.949
WILLIAM:
<i> We sent our troops</i>
<i> north days ago.</i>

20:17.951 --> 20:19.517
We lost
their supply route.

20:19.519 --> 20:21.352
What do you mean
"we lost their supply route"?

20:21.354 --> 20:22.920
The intelligence
we received from Nicholas

20:22.922 --> 20:24.789
appears to have been
misinformation

20:24.791 --> 20:26.490
planted by the French.

20:26.492 --> 20:29.360
There was no French fleet
sent to engage us.

20:29.362 --> 20:30.928
It was all a ruse.

20:30.930 --> 20:32.997
Once we diverted our forces,
Marie de Guise

20:32.999 --> 20:34.899
was able to reclaim
the Glen Albyn Pass.

20:34.901 --> 20:36.801
Resulting skirmishes
left many of our men dead.

20:36.803 --> 20:39.537
And Mary made a fool of me

20:39.539 --> 20:40.705
again.

20:44.410 --> 20:46.244
What are you doing?

20:46.246 --> 20:47.912
I'm sorry, Your Highness.
It was just a speck of down

20:47.914 --> 20:49.313
from your pillow.

20:49.315 --> 20:50.681
There is one way
to turn

20:50.683 --> 20:52.984
the tide against Mary forever,
Your Grace.

20:52.986 --> 20:54.518
Yes, yes, yes, I know--
a marriage.

20:54.520 --> 20:56.020
Not just any marriage.

20:56.022 --> 20:58.889
A marriage to the most powerful
country in the world.

21:00.860 --> 21:03.995
Tell Don Carlos I'm ready
to accept his proposal.

21:15.408 --> 21:17.675
NICHOLAS:
Your Highness.

21:17.677 --> 21:19.543
Congratulations
on your victory in Scotland.

21:19.545 --> 21:21.946
Well, I couldn't have tricked
Elizabeth without you, Nicholas.

21:21.948 --> 21:23.414
Your spying played

21:23.416 --> 21:25.383
an instrumental role.

21:25.385 --> 21:26.684
Clearly I underestimated you.

21:26.686 --> 21:28.819
You certainly did.
Stealing my cipher?

21:28.821 --> 21:30.354
Bribing a royal
messenger?

21:30.356 --> 21:32.556
Tell me why I shouldn't
have you hanged?

21:32.558 --> 21:35.660
Because the truth is, you used
me and you got what you wanted.

21:35.662 --> 21:37.428
Whatever punishment you seek

21:37.430 --> 21:40.498
might pale in comparison
to what I face back in England,

21:40.500 --> 21:42.767
when I am called
before my very angry queen.

21:44.971 --> 21:47.438
(birds cawing)

21:47.440 --> 21:49.507
I wish our wedding
holiday would never end.

21:49.509 --> 21:50.808
We could stay here,

21:50.810 --> 21:52.376
away from court
and all its problems.

21:52.378 --> 21:54.445
Wouldn't that be nice?
Yes.

21:54.447 --> 21:56.314
Yes, it would.

21:56.316 --> 21:57.948
I could send for John.

21:57.950 --> 21:59.684
I'm sure Mary
would give me leave.

21:59.686 --> 22:00.985
We could go to your
estate in the country.

22:00.987 --> 22:03.354
Lola, you know
that's not possible.

22:03.356 --> 22:04.588
My life is at court.

22:04.590 --> 22:06.724
Your life is at court.

22:06.726 --> 22:09.860
But I like who you are
away from court.

22:09.862 --> 22:12.496
I suppose I worry about
the temptations there.

22:12.498 --> 22:14.465
Your ambitions...

22:14.467 --> 22:15.499
WOMAN:
You thief!

22:15.501 --> 22:17.034
You stole my father's land

22:17.036 --> 22:18.002
right out from
underneath him!

22:18.004 --> 22:19.603
Madam, your father willingly

22:19.605 --> 22:20.938
parted with that land.

22:20.940 --> 22:22.540
I have a signed contract
to prove it.

22:22.542 --> 22:24.075
My father is illiterate,
you snake.

22:24.077 --> 22:25.810
A fact that you
were well aware of

22:25.812 --> 22:27.611
when you held his hand
and signed the deed yourself.

22:27.613 --> 22:29.547
I just want what we're owed!

22:31.351 --> 22:32.783
Lola, please, I...

22:32.785 --> 22:34.785
Just tell me.

22:34.787 --> 22:35.886
Is it true?

22:43.029 --> 22:45.596
(Bash groans)

22:52.805 --> 22:55.639
A cross.

22:55.641 --> 22:58.776
Prince Don Carlos,
I've invited you here

22:58.778 --> 23:01.779
to formally begin
marriage negotiations.

23:01.781 --> 23:04.014
And I'm honored,
but I was hoping to discuss

23:04.016 --> 23:05.583
a small matter with you first.

23:05.585 --> 23:08.519
Can you tell me
why you haven't married?

23:08.521 --> 23:11.789
You've had many suitors,
many viable opportunities.

23:11.791 --> 23:12.957
Why have you waited so long?

23:12.959 --> 23:16.060
"So long"?

23:17.563 --> 23:20.564
As a woman
in a patriarchal society,

23:20.566 --> 23:22.500
I must proceed with caution

23:22.502 --> 23:24.802
when it comes to the
man I choose to marry.

23:24.804 --> 23:27.671
The man who will rule beside me.

23:27.673 --> 23:31.442
And are you part of this
"patriarchal society"?

23:31.444 --> 23:34.044
Part of...?

23:34.046 --> 23:35.513
Let me be clear.

23:35.515 --> 23:37.715
The rumor
at your own court is

23:37.717 --> 23:40.785
that you are secretly,
privately a man.

23:40.787 --> 23:42.520
That's absurd!

23:42.522 --> 23:44.121
It is strange.

23:44.123 --> 23:46.023
But you've been of marriageable
age for a decade.

23:46.025 --> 23:47.825
There is talk that a girl
was born and died.

23:47.827 --> 23:49.627
Retribution feared.

23:49.629 --> 23:51.996
A child quickly needed
for your father's brief visit.

23:51.998 --> 23:55.199
No girl at hand, boy with your
coloring presented instead.

23:55.201 --> 23:57.101
The deed done.

23:57.103 --> 24:01.172
And I not only a man
but an imposter?

24:01.174 --> 24:02.807
You can easily refute
the male element.

24:02.809 --> 24:03.974
The rest will fall away.

24:03.976 --> 24:05.476
Prove you're not a man.

24:05.478 --> 24:07.945
Show me your womanhood.

24:07.947 --> 24:10.147
My request is not sexual
but factual.

24:10.149 --> 24:12.016
How dare you ask such a thing?

24:12.018 --> 24:13.551
If I were your husband,

24:13.553 --> 24:15.586
you would grant me
such requests and more.

24:15.588 --> 24:17.588
As is custom.

24:17.590 --> 24:18.856
I'm afraid I must insist.

24:18.858 --> 24:22.493
Lift up your skirt,
Elizabeth.

24:27.467 --> 24:28.966
Elizabeth, what is it?

24:28.968 --> 24:30.134
Wait.

24:30.136 --> 24:32.002
Don Carlos shamed me.

24:32.004 --> 24:33.871
He insisted I prove
my womanhood.

24:33.873 --> 24:35.473
Your womanhood?

24:35.475 --> 24:36.740
There is a rumor at court.

24:36.742 --> 24:38.042
Clearly my maidservant
heard the same.

24:38.044 --> 24:39.743
She stroked my cheek.

24:39.745 --> 24:42.012
She was feeling for whiskers.

24:42.014 --> 24:45.749
What if this is
your wife's doing?

24:45.751 --> 24:48.052
(door opens)

24:48.054 --> 24:50.654
Hello, my dear.

24:50.656 --> 24:53.591
That's much prettier.

25:01.000 --> 25:04.702
Did you do it?

25:04.704 --> 25:07.171
Did you start that rumor?

25:07.173 --> 25:09.240
What do you mean?
What rumor?

25:09.242 --> 25:10.608
That Elizabeth is a man.

25:10.610 --> 25:12.676
(scoffs)
That nonsense?

25:12.678 --> 25:14.011
Can't believe you
haven't heard that before.

25:14.013 --> 25:15.546
It's been
circulating for ages.

25:15.548 --> 25:18.015
Robert, you accuse of me
of such terrible things.

25:18.017 --> 25:19.683
Why would I ever...?

25:19.685 --> 25:21.118
Because you know.

25:24.023 --> 25:25.789
Admit it, Amy.

25:25.791 --> 25:27.858
I don't know anything,
truly I don't.

25:27.860 --> 25:29.226
I love her.

25:29.228 --> 25:30.628
Don't.

25:30.630 --> 25:31.862
Please.

25:31.864 --> 25:33.097
I always have.

25:33.099 --> 25:35.132
I always will.

25:35.134 --> 25:37.001
She will use you
and toss you away.

25:37.003 --> 25:38.202
She has other lovers.

25:38.204 --> 25:39.904
Don't speak.
They come and go

25:39.906 --> 25:42.306
from her chambers.
They're on their knees for her

25:42.308 --> 25:44.041
as they're on their knees...
I am warning you!

25:44.043 --> 25:46.043
(gasping)

25:52.818 --> 25:54.818
(panting)

25:54.820 --> 25:58.088
While you are nothing to her,
I love you and I always will.

25:58.090 --> 26:00.824
I'll never leave you.

26:00.826 --> 26:04.261
What have I become?

26:05.898 --> 26:08.232
I wanted to be a good man

26:08.234 --> 26:10.668
and a good husband.

26:10.670 --> 26:13.604
You are that man... with me.

26:14.907 --> 26:17.308
Leave her, please.

26:17.310 --> 26:18.576
You'll be whole again.

26:18.578 --> 26:20.911
The good man I married.

26:20.913 --> 26:23.847
Stop this obsession
that is destroying you.

26:23.849 --> 26:27.017
Please, Robert, let her go.

26:29.221 --> 26:31.789
I'll stop.
(gasps)

26:33.726 --> 26:36.193
I swear it.

26:45.938 --> 26:47.104
This is your idea
of a honeymoon?

26:47.106 --> 26:48.939
Looting the locals
out of their lands?

26:48.941 --> 26:50.240
It's not what
it looks like.

26:50.242 --> 26:53.077
Then what is it?
Just tell me.

26:53.079 --> 26:56.080
Yes, I tricked that man
out of his lands.

26:56.082 --> 26:59.149
Because I could see
no other way.

26:59.151 --> 27:03.687
I didn't want to worry you,
but Catherine is coming for us.

27:03.689 --> 27:06.056
A woman like that does
not forgive or forget.

27:06.058 --> 27:07.625
These lands that I took--

27:07.627 --> 27:08.626
they're the only way I could

27:08.628 --> 27:09.627
see to protect our family.

27:09.629 --> 27:10.894
Protect us how?

27:10.896 --> 27:12.630
What does one have
to do with the other?

27:12.632 --> 27:14.164
That land,
combined with the lands

27:14.166 --> 27:15.299
that Francis gifted your son,

27:15.301 --> 27:16.767
they add up to one thing.

27:16.769 --> 27:20.070
John gets a seat
on the privy council.

27:20.072 --> 27:22.773
A seat that I will
occupy in his stead.

27:22.775 --> 27:25.709
Giving you a vote in Catherine's
fight for the regency.

27:25.711 --> 27:27.911
It will protect us.

27:27.913 --> 27:30.214
Catherine will need
to keep on my good side.

27:30.216 --> 27:33.350
Then why didn't you
just tell me that?

27:33.352 --> 27:37.087
Would you have
agreed to it if I had?

27:37.089 --> 27:38.922
Stealing land?

27:38.924 --> 27:41.925
No.

27:41.927 --> 27:43.727
You're going to pay
that woman's family

27:43.729 --> 27:45.062
the money they deserve.

27:45.064 --> 27:47.064
If that will satisfy you.

27:47.066 --> 27:50.200
I'm not sure it will.

27:50.202 --> 27:52.703
Nor am I.

27:52.705 --> 27:54.872
But you need to trust

27:54.874 --> 27:57.775
that I will always
do my best for us.

28:02.682 --> 28:03.847
It's a simple question,
Cardinal.

28:03.849 --> 28:05.149
What groups do you know of

28:05.151 --> 28:07.351
that use burning brands
on suspected witches?

28:07.353 --> 28:08.952
The Catholic Church

28:08.954 --> 28:11.755
doesn't condone such
barbaric practices.

28:11.757 --> 28:13.090
No, you prefer
to burn women alive.

28:13.092 --> 28:14.425
Delphine is innocent.

28:14.427 --> 28:16.060
You tied her to a stake.

28:16.062 --> 28:17.461
She's innocent of murder,
perhaps.

28:17.463 --> 28:19.430
Not of witchcraft.

28:19.432 --> 28:22.399
That's a stain that
can never be cleansed.

28:22.401 --> 28:24.802
Not even with crossed
brands of iron.

28:24.804 --> 28:27.304
I never mentioned a cross.

28:28.307 --> 28:29.339
Tell me the truth.

28:29.341 --> 28:30.708
(chuckles)

28:30.710 --> 28:32.409
The Sisters of, uh, St. Agatha

28:32.411 --> 28:36.447
have been rumored to perform
exorcisms of the iron cross.

28:36.449 --> 28:38.749
A pointless effort.

28:38.751 --> 28:41.151
No matter the
good intention.

28:43.089 --> 28:47.124
After all that talk
of armies and ships,

28:47.126 --> 28:48.792
you defeated the English with
nothing more than a letter.

28:48.794 --> 28:50.961
I can't take much of the credit.

28:50.963 --> 28:52.463
It was Mary's plan.

28:52.465 --> 28:54.198
How did you know it would work?

28:54.200 --> 28:56.033
I didn't.
I only made

28:56.035 --> 28:58.168
the best decision
that I could in a moment.

28:58.170 --> 28:59.737
Just like I did
with the galleons.

28:59.739 --> 29:02.439
I would've given up after that.

29:02.441 --> 29:03.907
I wanted to.

29:03.909 --> 29:05.042
But that's not an option.

29:05.044 --> 29:06.443
Not ever.

29:06.445 --> 29:08.145
Hardly a day goes by
where I don't wish

29:08.147 --> 29:09.880
someone else was
making the decisions.

29:09.882 --> 29:12.116
But you always
seem so confident.

29:12.118 --> 29:14.985
Remember, being king's
a performance!

29:14.987 --> 29:16.987
(horse neighs)

29:23.763 --> 29:26.096
Francis?

29:27.199 --> 29:30.100
Francis!

29:31.437 --> 29:32.803
Francis!

29:32.805 --> 29:34.338
Oh, my God,
what's happened?

29:34.340 --> 29:35.906
Where is the physician?

29:35.908 --> 29:38.142
He sent them away.
I told him...

29:38.144 --> 29:39.910
Charles, please, the physicians
are powerless now.

29:39.912 --> 29:41.445
"Powerless"--
what do you mean?

29:41.447 --> 29:42.813
Then we must find
another healer.

29:42.815 --> 29:44.448
Or Nostradamus
or that woman Bash

29:44.450 --> 29:45.916
was searching for--
Delphine.

29:45.918 --> 29:46.950
You can't die.

29:46.952 --> 29:48.352
I'm not ready.

29:48.354 --> 29:50.154
Charles, I know
that you're scared.

29:50.156 --> 29:52.055
But you are ready.

29:52.057 --> 29:53.190
As ready as I was.

29:53.192 --> 29:55.192
I'm not.

29:55.194 --> 29:57.561
You said ruling
was a performance.

29:57.563 --> 30:00.464
I-I can't even
pretend well enough.

30:00.466 --> 30:02.332
When I suggested the galleon
ships at the council meeting,

30:02.334 --> 30:03.934
it was all a lie.

30:03.936 --> 30:05.969
I snuck into your study
and looked at your notes,

30:05.971 --> 30:07.805
so I'd know what to say.

30:07.807 --> 30:09.506
I can't do this.
I'm not a king.

30:09.508 --> 30:10.808
You will be the king.

30:10.810 --> 30:12.342
We don't have a choice.

30:12.344 --> 30:14.311
That's not true.

30:14.313 --> 30:15.913
It can't be.

30:15.915 --> 30:18.015
(sighs)

30:20.219 --> 30:21.351
Mary, come to me.

30:21.353 --> 30:22.586
There may not
be much time.

30:22.588 --> 30:25.589
Come lay beside me.

30:25.591 --> 30:28.358
I don't understand.

30:28.360 --> 30:30.460
You were doing
so much better.

30:30.462 --> 30:33.263
The physician said it can
happen at the end.

30:33.265 --> 30:34.932
"The end"--
don't say that.

30:34.934 --> 30:37.534
One of God's small blessings.

30:38.871 --> 30:41.238
Mary, you've done enough.

30:41.240 --> 30:44.842
Fought so hard for me.

30:44.844 --> 30:48.345
All that's left now
is to enjoy my final hours.

30:48.347 --> 30:51.248
We should call for Catherine.

30:51.250 --> 30:53.617
No. No.

30:53.619 --> 30:55.953
I want my last hours

30:55.955 --> 30:57.955
to be in peace.

31:00.159 --> 31:02.559
Alone with you.

31:12.037 --> 31:13.904
I love you.

31:13.906 --> 31:16.506
And I thank God
for the time we've had.

31:28.120 --> 31:29.453
CATHERINE:
<i> If it isn't the newlywed.</i>

31:29.455 --> 31:32.389
Catherine.

31:32.391 --> 31:34.424
You seem remarkably cheery.

31:34.426 --> 31:36.894
Oh, I am.

31:36.896 --> 31:39.396
I've put it all together.

31:39.398 --> 31:42.933
I know about the rat.

31:42.935 --> 31:46.036
You planted it in Lola's bath
to scare her into marrying you.

31:46.038 --> 31:47.371
(clicks tongue)

31:47.373 --> 31:49.907
Her fear of me actually
helped you land her.

31:49.909 --> 31:51.375
Admit it, Stephan.

31:51.377 --> 31:52.576
I did no such thing.

31:52.578 --> 31:55.012
You and I are
so very alike.

31:55.014 --> 31:57.381
Oh, we are nothing alike.

31:57.383 --> 31:58.982
Falling in love made me

31:58.984 --> 32:01.184
a better man.

32:01.186 --> 32:03.153
And it brought out
the worst in you.

32:03.155 --> 32:04.321
You made me feel vulnerable.

32:04.323 --> 32:05.455
It's true.

32:05.457 --> 32:07.057
I don't like that.

32:07.059 --> 32:09.259
You don't like it, either,
or else you could have

32:09.261 --> 32:11.061
taken more time to woo her.

32:11.063 --> 32:13.463
You like certainty.

32:13.465 --> 32:15.465
Results.

32:15.467 --> 32:17.701
You also like the hunt.

32:17.703 --> 32:19.937
Now that you've
bagged your prey,

32:19.939 --> 32:21.471
how long before
your interest wanders?

32:21.473 --> 32:23.340
I love her.

32:23.342 --> 32:24.942
You'll miss me.

32:24.944 --> 32:26.009
She'll judge you.

32:26.011 --> 32:27.044
And in so doing,

32:27.046 --> 32:30.147
miss the best parts of you.

32:30.149 --> 32:33.050
I loathe you.

32:33.052 --> 32:35.419
Because you know
I'm right.

32:37.456 --> 32:40.524
I'm also a hell
of a lot more fun.

32:47.499 --> 32:50.634
Don Carlos and his retinue
made a hasty exit.

32:50.636 --> 32:53.437
His terms were
unacceptable.

32:53.439 --> 32:55.339
I will not marry...

32:55.341 --> 32:58.308
anyone... ever.

32:58.310 --> 33:01.511
I will consider the suitors
they parade before me

33:01.513 --> 33:03.380
in order to placate
the nobles.

33:03.382 --> 33:05.248
But between you and I, William,

33:05.250 --> 33:08.118
I swear to you,

33:08.120 --> 33:09.586
it will never happen.

33:09.588 --> 33:11.254
Don Carlos was right.

33:11.256 --> 33:12.589
It is a fact of our time.

33:12.591 --> 33:14.658
A man rules his wife,

33:14.660 --> 33:16.727
even if his wife
is a queen.

33:16.729 --> 33:19.529
I will not be
laid low by any man.

33:19.531 --> 33:22.299
I will not be ruled by anyone.

33:22.301 --> 33:24.568
This choice will leave you open

33:24.570 --> 33:28.071
to unsavory unions.

33:28.073 --> 33:29.406
It will lead you
straight back to Dudley.

33:29.408 --> 33:31.274
So what?

33:31.276 --> 33:33.010
We love each other.

33:33.012 --> 33:36.013
I will give England my life
but not my happiness.

33:36.015 --> 33:37.347
Please, William, stop.

33:37.349 --> 33:39.750
Your judgment pains me.

33:39.752 --> 33:41.218
Elizabeth,

33:41.220 --> 33:42.586
you cannot rule alone.

33:42.588 --> 33:43.620
No woman could.

33:43.622 --> 33:45.022
I can.

33:45.024 --> 33:46.723
And I will.

33:46.725 --> 33:49.559
I will show England
their leader is fierce

33:49.561 --> 33:52.295
and brilliant and strong.

33:52.297 --> 33:54.631
I will draw them to me
and they will love me.

33:54.633 --> 33:57.034
And thank me
for loving only them.

33:57.036 --> 33:59.336
Why do you refuse
to see the truth?

33:59.338 --> 34:01.438
That a monarchy needs more
than a ruler, it needs an heir.

34:01.440 --> 34:02.773
If you never wed,
you will always

34:02.775 --> 34:04.775
be vulnerable to a queen
who will marry.

34:04.777 --> 34:06.610
Mary knows that,
and when her husband dies,

34:06.612 --> 34:08.078
she'll take another.

34:08.080 --> 34:09.579
With this choice,
you will ensure

34:09.581 --> 34:10.814
that Mary, Queen of Scots,

34:10.816 --> 34:12.582
will forever threaten you.

34:15.487 --> 34:19.089
Then it will be the challenge
of my life not to kill her.

34:20.292 --> 34:22.759
(bell rings)

34:22.761 --> 34:24.828
(panting)

34:24.830 --> 34:27.631
Please, I came here
for sanctuary.

34:27.633 --> 34:29.399
You promised to help me.

34:29.401 --> 34:31.401
We are helping you, child.

34:31.403 --> 34:33.537
We're purifying your soul.

34:33.539 --> 34:36.840
The iron cross drives out Satan.

34:36.842 --> 34:39.409
(door opens)

34:39.411 --> 34:40.777
You mustn't interfere!

34:40.779 --> 34:42.179
She still has Satan
within her soul.

34:42.181 --> 34:44.848
We must continue
until she feels no pain.

34:44.850 --> 34:46.550
Only then
will her soul be clean!

34:46.552 --> 34:48.351
Anyone will stop feeling pain
once you burn

34:48.353 --> 34:49.586
deep enough, you fool.

34:49.588 --> 34:51.788
Satan has nothing to do with it.

34:51.790 --> 34:55.125
Let's go.

34:57.863 --> 34:59.863
CHARLES:
Bash.

35:01.500 --> 35:02.566
Charles?

35:02.568 --> 35:04.501
Look after her.

35:04.503 --> 35:06.103
Why are you here?

35:06.105 --> 35:07.671
Your deputy told me
where you'd gone.

35:07.673 --> 35:10.273
I've come for Delphine.
I know your gifts are real.

35:10.275 --> 35:12.275
I've seen their
effects on Bash.

35:12.277 --> 35:13.877
And now I need you to save
the king of France.

35:13.879 --> 35:15.612
No, Charles.

35:15.614 --> 35:17.747
I want to save Francis
as much as you do, believe me.

35:17.749 --> 35:19.249
But you must understand.

35:19.251 --> 35:20.884
There is a price to be paid
for her healing.

35:20.886 --> 35:22.519
I don't care.

35:22.521 --> 35:25.522
As the dauphin of France,

35:25.524 --> 35:27.424
heir to the throne,

35:27.426 --> 35:30.460
I command you to obey.

35:35.234 --> 35:37.701
Is the pain terrible?

35:42.141 --> 35:45.275
Whisper me our future.

35:45.277 --> 35:47.144
I can't bear to think

35:47.146 --> 35:48.712
about a future anymore,
not without you.

35:48.714 --> 35:50.914
Then keep me in it.

35:50.916 --> 35:53.884
Tell me about our happy lives.

35:55.320 --> 35:58.755
I wanted
to give you children.

36:04.863 --> 36:07.430
Aren't they playing outside?

36:07.432 --> 36:08.932
Don't you hear them?

36:08.934 --> 36:11.635
Francis...

36:11.637 --> 36:15.338
Our lovely children.

36:17.543 --> 36:19.876
Anne...

36:19.878 --> 36:21.912
and James.

36:21.914 --> 36:23.246
Yes.

36:23.248 --> 36:25.815
Anne and James.

36:25.817 --> 36:29.653
Anne takes after you.

36:29.655 --> 36:33.390
She's so strong
and beautiful.

36:33.392 --> 36:35.625
She's fast as lightning.

36:35.627 --> 36:37.394
She...

36:37.396 --> 36:40.263
She never lets James win.

36:40.265 --> 36:42.699
When they chase each other
around the castle,

36:42.701 --> 36:45.435
that's right--
Anne always wins.

36:45.437 --> 36:47.437
It's all they'll
talk about at dinner.

36:47.439 --> 36:48.838
She wants your praise.

36:48.840 --> 36:52.275
And after dinner, your usual
game of catch with Anne,

36:52.277 --> 36:55.345
James will want your attention,
too, with his reading.

36:55.347 --> 36:58.415
I'll have him work on it.

36:58.417 --> 37:00.817
You promise?

37:03.589 --> 37:06.423
Promise me,
I mean it.

37:08.360 --> 37:11.228
Promise me you'll try.

37:11.230 --> 37:13.230
One year of marriage,
it isn't enough.

37:13.232 --> 37:15.699
Fight, Francis, please.

37:15.701 --> 37:17.767
I will give you children.

37:17.769 --> 37:20.003
Don't give up on our dreams.

37:20.005 --> 37:22.939
On the life
that we could have.

37:27.379 --> 37:30.313
It's such a beautiful dream.

37:34.319 --> 37:36.720
(moans)

37:43.595 --> 37:46.529
No.

37:46.531 --> 37:49.599
No, Francis,
don't leave me.

37:49.601 --> 37:50.934
Not yet.
Not yet!

37:50.936 --> 37:52.802
Come back to me,
Francis!

37:52.804 --> 37:53.903
Francis,
come back to me!

37:53.905 --> 37:55.572
No, no, not yet!
(door opens)

37:58.377 --> 38:00.310
He's gone!

38:02.281 --> 38:04.948
This is Delphine, the healer.
I-I've brought her for Francis.

38:04.950 --> 38:06.950
It's too late!

38:06.952 --> 38:08.685
BASH: There's no guarantee
she can help him.

38:08.687 --> 38:10.553
And even if she can,
there may be a price.

38:10.555 --> 38:12.289
What do you mean "a price"?

38:12.291 --> 38:13.690
The price
of someone else's life.

38:13.692 --> 38:14.691
You can't be sure.

38:14.693 --> 38:16.426
And even if there is,

38:16.428 --> 38:17.560
he's your brother.

38:17.562 --> 38:19.963
Your husband.

38:19.965 --> 38:21.698
The king of France.

38:21.700 --> 38:22.966
And what's the cost
of a king's life, Charles?

38:22.968 --> 38:24.034
Your life?

38:24.036 --> 38:26.436
Yours?

38:26.438 --> 38:29.606
If the price is my life for his,
I will give it.

38:29.608 --> 38:31.474
Bring him back.
Are you certain?

38:31.476 --> 38:33.343
Yes, I am!
Do it now, do it!

38:33.345 --> 38:35.445
Please, hurry!

38:35.447 --> 38:38.381
Everyone needs to step away.

38:49.628 --> 38:51.461
CHARLES:
What is she doing?

38:51.463 --> 38:54.597
BASH: Be quiet.
Let her work.

38:54.599 --> 38:57.400
(deep breathing)

39:12.451 --> 39:14.484
(gasps)

39:14.486 --> 39:16.953
Francis!
Oh, my God.

39:24.396 --> 39:26.029
Mary.

39:26.031 --> 39:28.865
You're alive!

39:30.068 --> 39:32.001
You came back to me.

39:32.003 --> 39:34.704
(loud thud)

39:42.614 --> 39:45.482
Was the cost your life?

39:46.618 --> 39:50.620
(low moaning)

40:01.500 --> 40:04.100
MARIE:
<i> We worked well together,</i>
<i> daughter.</i>

40:04.102 --> 40:06.503
<i> Scotland awaits</i>
<i> her queen's return.</i>

40:06.505 --> 40:09.572
<i> Until then,</i>
<i> your country and your throne</i>

40:09.574 --> 40:12.976
<i> are as safe as they can be</i>
<i> in my hands.</i>

40:18.183 --> 40:21.084
Your Grace!

40:21.086 --> 40:23.119
(gasps)

40:23.121 --> 40:25.088
Madam!
My Lord, she's dead!
