00:07.797 --> 00:09.631
- You should take her.
- What?!

00:09.672 --> 00:12.088
- I don't think I was supposed
to be a mom.

00:12.130 --> 00:13.797
- He's a scumbag mind molester!

00:13.839 --> 00:15.380
- This is never going to trial.

00:15.422 --> 00:16.839
<i>[Anne] There's a job</i>
<i>at the university,</i>

00:16.881 --> 00:18.756
and they need a therapist,
and I'm applying,

00:18.797 --> 00:20.714
so I can you know, get even.

00:20.756 --> 00:22.756
- How much is school?
- It's 10k.

00:22.797 --> 00:24.047
- 10k.

00:24.088 --> 00:25.923
- I think we need to go
to therapy.

00:25.964 --> 00:27.672
<i>We have to figure out how</i>
<i>to parent together, right?</i>

00:27.714 --> 00:29.631
- Oh, there she is.
Oh my God!

00:32.631 --> 00:34.172
(Cell phone chimes)

00:36.339 --> 00:38.088
- Wha...

00:41.255 --> 00:42.923
(Groans)

00:45.339 --> 00:47.547
Oh God. Hey.

00:47.589 --> 00:49.547
Hey, you've gotta wake up.

00:49.589 --> 00:51.172
Hey!
- Five more minutes.

00:51.214 --> 00:52.797
- No more minutes, dude,
you gotta go.

00:52.839 --> 00:55.505
- Oh man, I fell asleep.
- Mhmm.

00:55.547 --> 00:58.005
- I so wanted you to experience
all the "Fast and Furiouses".

00:58.047 --> 00:59.339
We can watch them next time,
right?

00:59.380 --> 01:01.005
- Y-yeah, next time for sure,
come on, let's go.

01:01.047 --> 01:03.130
- Get out before my kids
wake up.

01:03.172 --> 01:04.756
- I mean it, come on.

01:04.797 --> 01:07.088
- You know, I could help.

01:07.130 --> 01:09.297
Kids like me; they think
I'm one of them.

01:09.339 --> 01:10.839
- Yeah? That's sweet,

01:10.881 --> 01:13.005
but I don't introduce guys
I date to my kids.

01:13.047 --> 01:14.672
Not that I date a lot of guys.

01:14.714 --> 01:17.005
And not that we're dating,
just...

01:17.047 --> 01:19.464
your deal is supposed to be
to come over at 11,

01:19.505 --> 01:20.923
and you're gone by...

01:20.964 --> 01:22.547
Hello?

01:22.589 --> 01:24.631
- They're huge.

01:24.672 --> 01:26.631
- Oh yeah, that's Ella's
breakfast right there,

01:26.672 --> 01:28.088
they're pretty full.

01:31.714 --> 01:33.631
Mm, go ahead.

01:33.672 --> 01:35.130
(Splashes)

01:35.172 --> 01:36.505
Uh...

01:39.422 --> 01:41.297
are you...
- That kinda made me hard.

01:41.339 --> 01:43.422
I want more.
- What?! No!

01:43.464 --> 01:45.547
- Come on, give me a sip,
it's hot. It's so hot.

01:45.589 --> 01:47.297
- You are not going to be
breastfed by me.

01:47.339 --> 01:49.005
- Yes, I will.

01:51.839 --> 01:53.088
♪ Listen to me
listen to me ♪

01:53.130 --> 01:54.130

(Door opens, footsteps thud)

02:02.380 --> 02:03.964
(Kate sighs)

02:05.214 --> 02:07.464
- Thanks for showing up.

02:09.214 --> 02:11.547
- This wasn't exactly
convenient, okay?

02:11.589 --> 02:14.339
Maybe-maybe next time you could
just handle this yourself.

02:14.380 --> 02:16.547
- It's couple's therapy.

02:16.589 --> 02:18.714
Both of us being here
is kinda the key thing, so...

02:18.756 --> 02:20.881
- Yeah well, we're both here
because of you.

02:20.923 --> 02:23.130
- Right.
- So...

02:25.964 --> 02:27.756
- Thank you for being here.

02:27.797 --> 02:30.255
And thank you for letting me
see Ella.

02:30.297 --> 02:32.631
She's absolutely perfect.
- I know.

02:34.172 --> 02:35.464
- How's breastfeeding going,
by the way?

02:35.505 --> 02:36.631
Does she get enough?

02:36.672 --> 02:38.964
- What? Why would you ask that?

02:39.005 --> 02:40.214
Why wouldn't she be getting
enough?

02:40.255 --> 02:41.672
She's getting so much,
she's getting all of it,

02:41.714 --> 02:43.964
no one else is.

02:44.005 --> 02:46.339
- Are you breastfeeding
somebody else?

02:46.380 --> 02:48.714
- No! Why would I-who would
possibly

02:48.756 --> 02:50.589
get turned on by the...

02:50.631 --> 02:52.839
- Turned on?
- No! Ugh! (Chuckles)

02:52.881 --> 02:56.255
I'm with you,
I don't find it arousing.

02:56.297 --> 02:58.047
- Are you seeing somebody else?

02:58.088 --> 02:59.923
- No. Are you?

02:59.964 --> 03:01.380
- No.
- All right.

03:01.422 --> 03:03.464
Then stop asking so many
questions and just like,

03:03.505 --> 03:05.297
chill out, you know, just...

03:05.339 --> 03:07.714
take it down a notch.
- Gee, I just...

03:07.756 --> 03:10.923
- Look, I'm happy you wanna be
more involved with the kids.

03:10.964 --> 03:13.214
'Cause we are in this
co-parenting thing together.

03:13.255 --> 03:15.130
But let's just focus
on the kids, okay?

03:15.172 --> 03:16.631
- I agree.

03:16.672 --> 03:18.839
In fact, I was hoping
to ask you

03:18.881 --> 03:20.422
if I could take them tonight.

03:20.464 --> 03:22.339
- Tonight? Oh, uh, yeah.

03:22.380 --> 03:23.589
I actually could
really use the break.

03:23.631 --> 03:25.172
Thanks.
- Great.

03:25.214 --> 03:26.839
- Great.

03:26.881 --> 03:29.422
This is not a junkyard,
it's a garage.

03:29.464 --> 03:30.964
You know? (Laughs)

03:31.005 --> 03:33.464
- Is that from something?

03:33.505 --> 03:34.923
- "The Fast and Furious".

03:34.964 --> 03:36.964
Six.

03:37.005 --> 03:38.589
Or is it Nine?
- "Tokyo Drift".

03:38.631 --> 03:40.464
- Oh, shut up, Carl!

03:41.797 --> 03:43.047
(Cars rumble)

03:43.088 --> 03:44.422
Anne: Outside of being
a psychiatrist,

03:44.464 --> 03:46.339
I have firsthand experience
with what's happened

03:46.380 --> 03:48.422
at the school.
I have the potential

03:48.464 --> 03:50.464
to be very effective
with these students.

03:50.505 --> 03:52.839
- I know, but the last thing
I need is a therapist

03:52.881 --> 03:54.964
who's still going through
her own trauma.

03:55.047 --> 03:56.797
- My trauma's an asset to you.

03:56.839 --> 03:59.339
- Or a liability.
- I'm fine!

04:02.130 --> 04:04.589
Look, you will not find someone
more motivated than me

04:04.631 --> 04:07.088
for this position,
I can promise you that.

04:07.130 --> 04:09.505
- Do you know what you're
getting into with these kids?

04:09.547 --> 04:11.005
- I do, yeah.

04:12.130 --> 04:13.923
- Okay...

04:13.964 --> 04:15.756
let's try this.

04:15.797 --> 04:17.923
- Thank you,
you won't be disappointed.

04:17.964 --> 04:20.088
- I hope not.

04:20.130 --> 04:21.964
Jenny: Well, your business
is important to us,

04:22.005 --> 04:23.756
so let me just ask.

04:23.797 --> 04:25.505
(Hum of excited chatter)
Wait.

04:25.547 --> 04:27.047
(Phone rings)

04:27.088 --> 04:28.797
I gotta call you back.

04:28.839 --> 04:30.464
(Excited chatter)
Woman: You're so sweet!

04:30.505 --> 04:33.214
Gena: Thank you.
Woman: Hi! Look at his hair!

04:33.255 --> 04:34.631
(All laughing, murmuring)

04:34.672 --> 04:36.422
- Excuse me. Sorry.

04:36.464 --> 04:38.130
Woman: Aw, he's such a good boy!

04:38.172 --> 04:40.380
- Ahem!
- Hey, loser!

04:40.422 --> 04:42.631
- Gena, I heard you were coming
back to work, but I...

04:43.923 --> 04:46.672
Wow, are you pregnant again?

04:46.714 --> 04:49.464
- Five months,
and Luca just turned one.

04:49.505 --> 04:51.547
Okay, get back to work.
It was good to see you guys.

04:51.589 --> 04:54.255
Say buh-bye.

04:55.631 --> 04:57.297
- (Laughs nervously)
- But honestly,

04:57.339 --> 04:59.339
bring it on, bitch!
I love being a mom.

04:59.380 --> 05:01.797
- Yeah, it's so great.

05:04.589 --> 05:06.797
- I'm sorry for getting
on your case before.

05:06.839 --> 05:09.214
- Um...
- About not having fun.

05:09.255 --> 05:11.505
I get it now.

05:11.547 --> 05:13.881
Having a family is so much
more fulfilling

05:13.923 --> 05:15.923
than going to some stupid club.

05:15.964 --> 05:18.339
- Mhmm...
- So how's Zoe?

05:18.380 --> 05:20.214
She must be so big now.
- She is.

05:20.255 --> 05:21.797
- Yeah? You got pics?

05:21.839 --> 05:24.547
- Yeah, sure...

05:24.589 --> 05:28.088
- Oh, isn't she like,
one there?

05:29.547 --> 05:32.297
- No, no,
she just looks young.

05:32.339 --> 05:34.422
Yeah, just Asian genes.

05:34.464 --> 05:36.172
- Oh, well, I'd love
to see her.

05:36.214 --> 05:37.964
- Yeah, me too.

05:38.005 --> 05:39.714
- What?

05:39.756 --> 05:43.255
- I would love for you
to see her.

05:43.297 --> 05:45.005
- Hey, I'm in this moms group,

05:45.047 --> 05:46.923
and tonight we're letting
the babies try lemons

05:46.964 --> 05:49.047
for the first time, yes!

05:49.088 --> 05:51.047
They don't know
what sour tastes like.

05:51.088 --> 05:52.672
It's gonna be fun.

05:52.714 --> 05:54.505
You should come, bring Zoe.

05:54.547 --> 05:56.339
- Yeah, um...

05:56.380 --> 05:58.088
I'm there!

05:58.130 --> 05:59.589
- Great!

06:01.464 --> 06:02.589

06:02.631 --> 06:04.964
- Oh, morning guys, what up?

06:05.005 --> 06:06.547
What's the hot goss?

06:06.589 --> 06:08.130
Uh oh, bad goss?

06:10.422 --> 06:12.130
- You haven't paid anyone yet.

06:12.172 --> 06:13.756
We thought we were gonna
get our cheques yesterday,

06:13.797 --> 06:16.255
and we didn't, again.
- We do have cash coming in,

06:16.297 --> 06:18.172
it just might take a little
bit longer...

06:18.214 --> 06:19.714
uh, to get the invoices issued.

06:19.756 --> 06:21.672
- We can't afford to keep
working for nothing, Kate.

06:21.714 --> 06:23.547
- I hear you. I do, okay?

06:23.589 --> 06:26.255
And you will get paid
by the end of the week.

06:26.297 --> 06:28.422
- Really? How?
- Yeah.

06:28.464 --> 06:30.380
Um, I haven't 100% figured
that out yet,

06:30.422 --> 06:31.923

Nick, thank you so much for
coming in on such short notice.

06:45.505 --> 06:48.172
- Oh, well, I was happy
to get your call.

06:51.464 --> 06:53.839
This rhino love-fest
is getting outta hand.

06:55.297 --> 06:57.547
Last night, a bunch of
protesters attacked my store.

06:57.589 --> 06:59.881
They covered the windows
in red paint.

06:59.923 --> 07:02.088
And they defaced the
"Midsummer Madness Sale"

07:02.130 --> 07:04.339
banners to read,
"Murder Madness Satan."

07:04.380 --> 07:06.797
You gotta help me out.

07:06.839 --> 07:08.923
- Uh, I certainly can,
however in return,

07:08.964 --> 07:11.255
I am gonna require my fee
paid up front.

07:11.297 --> 07:12.672
- Sure, whatever.
- Great.

07:12.714 --> 07:14.464
- I need to people to know

07:14.505 --> 07:16.672
that Nick Peterson
is a good guy.

07:16.714 --> 07:18.756
- All right.
- People like me.

07:18.797 --> 07:20.464
My customers like me.
- Okay.

07:20.505 --> 07:22.505
- I got you a peach muffin.

07:25.172 --> 07:26.923
- Uh, thank you.

07:26.964 --> 07:28.297
Okay. So...

07:29.839 --> 07:31.422
here's what I propose we do.

07:31.464 --> 07:33.005
- Is this gonna take a long
time to explain?

07:33.047 --> 07:35.214
Because I'm parked
in a handicapped spot.

07:35.255 --> 07:37.631
- Oh, uh, no.
Um, basically,

07:37.672 --> 07:39.172
I'm gonna set up
a press conference,

07:39.214 --> 07:40.881
you'll talk to the media,

07:40.923 --> 07:42.797
we'll offer them
an olive branch.

07:42.839 --> 07:44.756
- What kind of olive branch?

07:44.797 --> 07:46.380
- The money kind.

07:46.422 --> 07:48.464
Stick to the talking points
we went over,

07:48.505 --> 07:50.214
take your time,
you're gonna be fine.

07:50.255 --> 07:52.047
- Kate, if this works,

07:52.088 --> 07:54.172
I'm gonna give you our
employee discount for life.

07:54.214 --> 07:56.839
- That is very kind, but the
amount we agreed on is fine.

07:56.881 --> 07:59.756
Oh, let's keep those finger
guns in their holsters, okay?

07:59.797 --> 08:01.589
- Okay.

08:01.631 --> 08:03.672
- Kate, hi!
- Oh my God!

08:03.714 --> 08:06.339
- Dana, River's mom
from nursery school, hi.

08:06.380 --> 08:08.297
- Of course! I never forget
the cool moms, how are you?

08:08.339 --> 08:09.672
- I didn't know that you
were in journalism.

08:09.714 --> 08:11.797
- Oh I'm not,
I'm actually in um, PR.

08:11.839 --> 08:14.130
- Really? For Peterson?

08:14.172 --> 08:16.422
- Uh... y-yeah.

08:16.464 --> 08:20.130
It's sort of a last minute
impartial kinda thing-ama-jing.

08:20.172 --> 08:22.422
Nick: Uh, ladies and gentlemen.
- Yeah, yeah, get up there.

08:22.464 --> 08:23.964
- Excuse me, ladies
and gentlemen!

08:24.005 --> 08:25.714
(Sighs)

08:25.756 --> 08:27.088
(Camera shutters click)

08:33.130 --> 08:35.631
Guess what?
I shot a rhinoceros.

08:35.672 --> 08:37.172
- Oh God.

08:37.214 --> 08:39.505
- I stalked the beast
for three days,

08:39.547 --> 08:42.631
through unforgiving terrain,
and scorching heat.

08:42.672 --> 08:44.797
In a nutshell, it was...

08:47.047 --> 08:50.255
the greatest experience
of my life!

08:50.297 --> 08:51.589
- Ahem!

08:55.214 --> 08:57.088
- Okay.

08:57.130 --> 08:59.380
I am not a monster.

08:59.422 --> 09:01.047
And to prove it...

09:01.088 --> 09:03.422
- Say it.

09:03.464 --> 09:05.380
- I am donating ten percent
of last year's...

09:05.422 --> 09:07.964

Well, it's kinda my house too.

18:34.088 --> 18:35.964
- Because you're the son
of your parents!

18:36.005 --> 18:37.923
Dude, why didn't you say you
live with your Mom and Dad?

18:37.964 --> 18:39.422
- Well, it doesn't sound
super cool, okay?

18:39.464 --> 18:41.547
And it's only temporary,
and they're not here.

18:41.589 --> 18:43.130
They're visiting my Great-Aunt
in Michigan all week.

18:44.339 --> 18:46.422
- Sex with you and me is like,

18:46.464 --> 18:47.756
inappropriate on the best
of days,

18:47.797 --> 18:49.839
but in Richard's house?
I can't!

18:49.881 --> 18:51.923
- Kate, please!
Okay, I get why this is weird.

18:51.964 --> 18:53.797
When we're at your place
we have to hide from the kids,

18:53.839 --> 18:55.839
and then when we're at work
we have to hide

18:55.881 --> 18:57.339
from everyone there.
There's nobody here but us.

18:57.380 --> 19:00.047
- I just feel like I've screwed
up enough today.

19:00.088 --> 19:01.672
- Screwed up?

19:01.714 --> 19:03.255
You took a rhino killer's money
and you gave it

19:03.297 --> 19:05.589
to the less fortunate.

19:05.631 --> 19:07.214
You're basically a sexy
Robin Hood.

19:07.255 --> 19:09.505
- (Chuckles)

19:11.672 --> 19:13.214
- Let me be your Maid Marion.

19:13.255 --> 19:14.172
- (Sighs)

19:14.214 --> 19:16.088
(Door creaks, slams)

19:19.255 --> 19:21.839
(Exhale heavily)

19:21.881 --> 19:23.756
- Oh, just beat it
for a minute, for a sec!

19:23.797 --> 19:24.964
- Come on, just a taste, please?

19:25.005 --> 19:27.631
- Come on, no!
Can you just be normal?!

19:27.672 --> 19:29.214
- You know it's not just
for babies?

19:29.255 --> 19:30.422
Like, bodybuilders chug it,
five bucks an ounce.

19:30.464 --> 19:32.547
- There's no way that's true.

19:32.589 --> 19:34.422
- Oh no, I've been looking
it up online,

19:34.464 --> 19:36.380
and I think I know a way
to make it hot for you.

19:36.422 --> 19:39.130
- No.
- Gimme five seconds, okay?

19:39.172 --> 19:41.005
If you hate it,
I'll never ask again.

19:42.464 --> 19:43.380
- You have one second.

19:43.422 --> 19:45.255
(Laughs) Okay!

19:45.297 --> 19:48.339
Easy.

19:51.255 --> 19:53.172
Ooh! Ooh! Ah! Aaah!

19:53.214 --> 19:54.631
(Moans)

19:54.672 --> 19:56.589
(Door creaks, bangs)

19:59.297 --> 20:01.297
<i>[Richard] Hello?</i>

20:03.339 --> 20:06.005
- Is that your Dad?
- Yeah.

20:06.047 --> 20:08.339
[Richard] Forrest, you home?
- Oh my God!

20:11.464 --> 20:12.297
- Forrest?

20:12.339 --> 20:15.255
(Door creaks)

20:19.714 --> 20:21.214
Forrest!
Hey! You're home!

20:22.505 --> 20:24.464
Why didn't you answer?

20:24.505 --> 20:26.547
- Uh, I was, I was sleeping.

20:26.589 --> 20:28.422
I'm-I'm-I'm sick.

20:29.547 --> 20:32.422
- Is that milk
on your upper lip?

20:32.464 --> 20:34.714
- I thought you were in
Michigan 'til Friday, Dad.

20:34.756 --> 20:36.631
- I called your Aunt Ida's
bluff.

20:36.672 --> 20:38.672
Deathbed, my ass.

20:38.714 --> 20:40.714
God, it stinks in here.

20:40.756 --> 20:42.672
- Oh yeah, don't go--
Dad? Uh...

20:42.714 --> 20:44.339
- Hey, the van Houtens have

20:44.380 --> 20:45.797
finished their swimming pool,
huh?

20:45.839 --> 20:48.297
- Dad? Uh...
- Have you seen this?

20:48.339 --> 20:49.422
You know, I've always
wondered if--

20:49.464 --> 20:51.881
(Both scream)
- Oh my God!

20:51.923 --> 20:53.797
- Oh my God!
- Oh my God!

20:53.839 --> 20:55.422
- Oh my God, Richard,
I'm so sorry!

20:55.464 --> 20:56.923
- Kate, what the hell?!
Oh my God!

20:56.964 --> 20:58.422
- This is not what
it looks like.

20:58.464 --> 21:00.547
- Dad, it's okay, I love her.
- What?!

21:00.589 --> 21:02.797
- Wait, what?
- I love you.

21:02.839 --> 21:04.214
- Oh my God!

21:05.589 --> 21:07.547
(Door slams)
- Isn't this awesome?

21:07.589 --> 21:09.505
Like, we can be together, now.
