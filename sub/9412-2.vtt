away from home...

Well, one of them anyway.
You just call me Carolyn.

01:19.767 --> 01:22.267
This is all really
fascinating and everything,

01:22.267 --> 01:24.233
but I kind of want to see my aunt.

01:24.233 --> 01:26.700
- Is she in her tent or something?
- Not exactly.

01:27.200 --> 01:30.500
She's... disappeared.

01:31.500 --> 01:35.367
I'm afraid there's still
no sign of our Dr. Thomas.

There may be a solution.

Mark, there's really
no need for any of this.

02:01.900 --> 02:04.900
Oh, yeah?
I heard you talking on the radio.

02:04.900 --> 02:06.900
You're lying about something.

02:11.333 --> 02:13.767
Gentlemen do not lie, Mark.

02:14.233 --> 02:16.667
They do, however,
often find occasion...

02:16.667 --> 02:19.800
to choose which truth to tell.

02:19.800 --> 02:22.700
Oh, yeah? Like what
really happened to my aunt?

02:22.700 --> 02:25.100
Yes.

02:25.100 --> 02:29.133
I'm afraid we haven't been
entirely honest...

02:29.133 --> 02:31.200
about our situation.

02:31.200 --> 02:35.033
But, well, I was afraid...

02:35.033 --> 02:38.700
you might find all of this
a bit hard to understand.

02:38.700 --> 02:42.267
- Try me.
- Very well.

02:42.267 --> 02:46.733
It all started about five years ago.

02:46.733 --> 02:49.233
Your aunt was studying
the rituals...

02:49.233 --> 02:51.733
of certain ancient tribes
of the region...

02:52.233 --> 02:55.733
when she stumbled upon something
known as "kahar lahi'ia."

02:55.733 --> 02:59.733
Roughly translated,
it means "jungle magic."

02:59.733 --> 03:02.233
It's rather hard to explain,

03:02.233 --> 03:04.733
but it's a sort of combination
of herbal medicines,

03:04.733 --> 03:07.233
meditation and hypnosis,

03:07.233 --> 03:10.733
and it gives the user virtually
unlimited telekinetic powers...

03:10.733 --> 03:13.733
over objects both animate
and inanimate,

03:14.233 --> 03:16.233
living or dead.

03:16.733 --> 03:19.233
Benna began experimenting
with jungle magic...

03:19.733 --> 03:23.233
using our poor workers here
as her first subjects.

03:23.233 --> 03:28.233
Unfortunately, the procedures
weren't entirely successful,

03:28.233 --> 03:32.233
and they've become as you see them--

03:32.233 --> 03:34.233
Mindless zombies,

03:34.233 --> 03:37.233
following orders without question.

03:37.233 --> 03:39.733
Useful, perhaps,

03:39.733 --> 03:42.733
but a terrible waste of human life.

03:44.233 --> 03:46.733
So what happened to my Aunt Benna?

03:46.733 --> 03:50.200
Yes, that is the sticky bit.

03:50.200 --> 03:55.200
You see, kahar lahi'ia
is a very strong power,

03:55.700 --> 04:00.200
and, like most powers,
it corrupts the user's personality.

04:00.200 --> 04:02.700
Your Aunt Benna began
to behave irrationally,

04:02.700 --> 04:05.200
forgetting who and where she was.

04:05.200 --> 04:08.700
One month ago,
she threatened to destroy all of us,

04:08.700 --> 04:12.700
and when we tried to stop her,
she ran into the jungle...

04:12.700 --> 04:14.667
and disappeared.

04:16.166 --> 04:18.666
That's impossible.

04:18.666 --> 04:21.166
I talked to her on the phone
a couple days ago.

04:21.166 --> 04:25.167
Ah, that was my wife's idea.

04:25.167 --> 04:28.667
We tracked you down with the gift...

04:28.667 --> 04:31.667
your aunt had planned
to send you on your birthday.

04:31.667 --> 04:35.667
We had an idea that the only way
to get Benna to return...

04:36.167 --> 04:39.667
and to convince her not to use
jungle magic anymore...

04:39.667 --> 04:43.167
was to bring you here to this island.

useful in the jungle too, my boy.

You were gonna use me as bait?

05:01.667 --> 05:04.667
Frankly, Mark,
we're at our wit's end.

05:04.667 --> 05:07.167
You see,
if your aunt is left alone,

05:07.167 --> 05:10.167
she may well use jungle magic...

05:10.167 --> 05:12.667
not only to harm herself,

05:12.667 --> 05:16.167
but possibly the rest of the world.

Aunt Benna!
Don't let 'em do this to me!

15:10.500 --> 15:14.967
A sort of do-it-yourself
head-shrinking machine.

15:14.967 --> 15:18.633
[ Screaming ]
Let me out!

15:18.633 --> 15:21.033
Tell me about the jungle magic.

15:21.033 --> 15:23.367
Let him go!

15:23.367 --> 15:26.733
- Very well.

15:26.733 --> 15:30.100
- [ Shouts In Foreign Language ]
- Aunt Benna! Help me!

15:30.100 --> 15:34.167
Remember your eighth birthday.
Remember the gift.

15:34.167 --> 15:37.600
- What eighth birthday? What gift?
- Remember.

15:37.600 --> 15:41.533
- Aunt Benna, don't let them do this to me!
- I'm going to ask you again.

15:41.533 --> 15:45.033
- Help!
- Tell me how kahar lahi'ia works.

[ Mark Screaming ]

15:59.133 --> 16:01.067
[ Gasping ]

Once more, Benna.
Tell me the secret of jungle magic.

16:06.000 --> 16:08.500
[ Yelling Continues ]

Remember your birthday.

16:11.400 --> 16:15.500
You're hurting me!
[ Screaming ]

16:15.500 --> 16:18.500
I must admit,
I'm surprised at you, Benna.

16:18.500 --> 16:21.933
I would've thought you cared
for your nephew enough to help him.

16:21.933 --> 16:24.800
But I'm a reasonable man.

16:24.800 --> 16:28.433
I'm going to give you one last chance.

16:28.433 --> 16:31.867
Eighth birthday. Eighth birthday.

16:31.867 --> 16:35.800
This is something too dangerous
to carry with me, Mark,

16:35.800 --> 16:39.267
so I need you to look after it for me.

16:39.267 --> 16:41.700
[ Groans ]
What happened?

16:41.700 --> 16:44.200
You must protect it,

16:44.700 --> 16:47.700
but you'll never
even know you have it.

16:48.700 --> 16:51.433
[ Screams ]

16:52.833 --> 16:56.267
Three seconds
to save your nephew's life.

One.

17:00.633 --> 17:04.133
Kahar lahia.

17:06.633 --> 17:09.633
The magic is in you, Mark.

17:11.633 --> 17:15.000
The magic is in you.

17:15.000 --> 17:17.967
It's not the head.
It's me!

17:17.967 --> 17:21.800
- Two.
- The magic is in me!

17:23.733 --> 17:25.467
Three.

All right!

18:40.500 --> 18:43.000
[ Laughing ]
You remembered!

18:43.000 --> 18:45.500
It had nothing to do with the head.

18:45.500 --> 18:48.000
You put the magic in me for--
for safekeeping.

18:48.000 --> 18:51.600
- Yes.
- And it worked. Big time.

18:52.100 --> 18:55.600
- Mark.
- I feel incredible! What else can I do?

18:55.600 --> 18:58.567
- Mark, you have done enough.
- Aw, come on.

18:58.567 --> 19:01.533
You gave it to me. I just want to
have a little fun with my birthday present.

19:02.033 --> 19:05.967
Mark, jungle magic is very dangerous
for any one person to have.

19:05.967 --> 19:09.967
Now you have protected it
for me for all of these years,

19:09.967 --> 19:14.400
and now...
you're going to be free.

19:16.400 --> 19:18.900
Look at the coin, Mark.

19:18.900 --> 19:21.900
Look at the coin.

19:22.400 --> 19:25.400
And forget.

19:28.900 --> 19:32.400
And that's...
how I got my shrunken head.

Mark, you weren't bothering Ed

19:35.900 --> 19:38.867
with another one of those wild
stories of yours, were you?

19:38.867 --> 19:43.300
Nah. We were just-- We were
just talking about the weather.

19:43.300 --> 19:46.300
- Right, Mark?
- Yeah. Yeah, that's right.

19:46.300 --> 19:48.767
Looks like rain.

19:48.767 --> 19:51.767
You guys better bring your umbrellas.

We're just going out for coffee.
I'll be home soon.

- I won't.

Please give us something.
