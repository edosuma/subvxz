<i>Rip-Fixes-Sync
by VaVooM</i>

01:44.151 --> 01:45.978
Are we checking for defects?

01:45.979 --> 01:50.311
- I'm so sorry, I was just...
- Checking it for comfort.

01:50.312 --> 01:56.018
Oh my god, you made this?

01:56.019 --> 01:58.770
- With old vintage lace.
- Used lace.

02:00.521 --> 02:01.768
I love it.

02:01.769 --> 02:03.353
Wait til you see
the wedding dress.

02:03.354 --> 02:07.561
My daughter threads a fit
like no one I've ever seen.

02:07.562 --> 02:09.144
I can't believe it, I mean,

02:09.145 --> 02:11.852
it's exactly what
I always dreamed.

02:11.853 --> 02:14.893
Well it was your
dream that inspired me.

02:14.894 --> 02:16.887
It's just, perfect.

02:18.812 --> 02:19.812
Thank you.

02:21.687 --> 02:25.229
- What do you think, mom?
- I think you need a better cake.

02:27.603 --> 02:29.769
Thank you so much
again, Andy, and Bonnie,

02:29.770 --> 02:31.977
you've both been so amazing.

02:31.978 --> 02:33.435
You're so welcome.

02:33.436 --> 02:35.269
I would say come back,
but that's something

02:35.270 --> 02:37.519
we never say at Bonnie's Bridal.

02:37.520 --> 02:41.978
Instead, our wish to you,
One love to last a lifetime.

02:41.979 --> 02:44.770
Bye.

02:47.061 --> 02:49.102
Nearly 600 weddings
since you were born

02:49.103 --> 02:50.935
and you're gonna be next.

02:50.936 --> 02:53.560
Well, technically
Felice is next.

02:53.561 --> 02:55.811
She and Troy have a whole
month on me and Jordan.

02:55.812 --> 02:58.019
Does Felice always
have to go first?

02:58.020 --> 02:59.477
Have you met Felice?

02:59.478 --> 03:01.269
You're a really good friend, Andy,

03:01.270 --> 03:03.310
neglecting your own
dress to finish hers.

03:03.311 --> 03:06.019
It's fine, I mean
I only had four dresses

03:06.020 --> 03:08.477
to make this month, two of
which are hers and mine.

03:08.478 --> 03:11.978
It's been a slow spring
so, worked in our favor.

03:11.979 --> 03:13.811
Which is good
practice, because someday

03:13.812 --> 03:15.228
you're gonna be
designing your own

03:15.229 --> 03:16.644
and you'll have your
own staff to make them.

03:16.645 --> 03:17.894
Oh yeah?

03:17.895 --> 03:20.727
What, Bonnie's Bridal
goes worldwide?

03:20.728 --> 03:23.144
You're laughing,
I'm not laughing.

03:23.145 --> 03:25.060
When would I even have the time?

03:25.061 --> 03:27.811
Once Jordan graduates,
we're gonna start a family,

03:27.812 --> 03:30.310
and have to work around
his crazy schedule and...

03:30.311 --> 03:32.477
Since when does it have
to be one way or the other?

03:32.478 --> 03:35.477
When your father and I were
raising you, we both were working.

03:35.478 --> 03:40.144
Yeah, and I was here
at your work every day.

03:40.145 --> 03:42.310
As a matter of fact, I still am.

03:42.311 --> 03:44.602
Well fine, move your family
to the dirty little city

03:44.603 --> 03:46.602
to accommodate Jordan's job.

03:46.603 --> 03:48.395
I'm just saying, why do
you have to sacrifice

03:48.396 --> 03:50.227
everything for your partner?

03:50.228 --> 03:52.143
You and Jordan
need to compromise.

03:52.144 --> 03:55.185
And we will, Jordan loves me.

03:55.186 --> 03:59.103
I know, and you love him,
but you love your work.

03:59.104 --> 04:00.644
Just remember that.

04:00.645 --> 04:04.018
Mom, I'm in the middle of
creating my very own wedding.

04:04.019 --> 04:05.810
How could I forget?

04:05.811 --> 04:08.020
- Cheers, honey.
- Cheers.

04:18.269 --> 04:20.687
You're home early, thank you!

04:25.936 --> 04:29.394
- Felice! What are you doing?
- I was using your restroom.

04:29.395 --> 04:30.893
And you need a new bulb.

04:30.894 --> 04:33.518
Almost used your trash can
as a toilet seat.

04:33.519 --> 04:35.103
I thought you were Jordan.

04:35.104 --> 04:39.309
You thought Jordan left class
early for you? That's cute.

04:39.310 --> 04:41.561
So, what do you
think of the flowers?

04:41.562 --> 04:45.352
Do you think the white
roses are like, bourgeoisie?

04:45.353 --> 04:46.893
Be honest.

04:46.894 --> 04:50.394
If you want white roses,
it's your big day, right?

04:50.395 --> 04:53.435
No one can say anything,
you get whatever you want.

04:53.436 --> 04:55.560
Good, I don't want 'em.

04:56.728 --> 04:59.310
It's just what my
snooty mother wants.

04:59.311 --> 05:02.977
What I want is, pink
roses everywhere,

05:02.978 --> 05:05.102
and for the only white
in the entire place

05:05.103 --> 05:08.561
to be my perfect ivory dress
made by my perfect maid of honor.

05:09.477 --> 05:10.977
Fine, whatever you want.

05:10.978 --> 05:14.227
And, what I want is for
my perfect maid of honor

05:14.228 --> 05:16.185
to join me next week
for the world famous

05:16.186 --> 05:18.269
Whitney Walsh's
bridal boot camp.

05:18.270 --> 05:20.936
- Bridal boot camp?
- Yes!

05:20.937 --> 05:23.977
- Felice, seriously?
- Sounds fun, huh?

05:25.812 --> 05:27.770
- No?
- No.

05:27.771 --> 05:31.477
- You said whatever I want.
- Yeah, within reason. That isn't.

05:31.478 --> 05:35.102
Okay, so if you don't go with me,
then I'm just gonna leave.

05:35.103 --> 05:37.267
Hi, I'd like to order
a chicken pad Thai,

05:37.268 --> 05:38.935
and an order of spring rolls.

05:38.936 --> 05:42.269
After you order another
order of that chicken pad Thai.

05:42.270 --> 05:44.268
Make that two pad Thai.

05:44.269 --> 05:48.434
Andy Phillips, five seven nine
Aspendale, thank you.

05:48.435 --> 05:50.185
Why are wedding
cakes never good?

05:50.186 --> 05:51.103
Almost every single
one that I've tried

05:51.104 --> 05:53.520
over the past week has been dry,

05:53.521 --> 05:56.601
and I'm sorry but
fondant is just nasty.

05:56.602 --> 05:59.061
My mom's bringing over
some sample slices tomorrow.

05:59.062 --> 06:00.935
If we find a good bakery,
you can use 'em too.

06:00.936 --> 06:03.935
So, have the same cake as you?

06:03.936 --> 06:05.309
No.

06:05.310 --> 06:07.892
Well, they make
different styles, you know.

06:07.893 --> 06:11.560
Yours can have as much sparkle
or whatever as you want.

06:11.561 --> 06:13.184
I just want it to taste good.

06:13.185 --> 06:18.019
If it tastes good and it has that
triple berry cream thing, I'm all in.

06:18.020 --> 06:21.476
Perfect, 'cause I want
dolce de leche anyway.

06:21.477 --> 06:24.977
And what about
Jordan's groom cake?

06:24.978 --> 06:28.310
He wants dark
chocolate strawberry.

06:28.311 --> 06:29.645
What about Troy?

06:30.769 --> 06:32.810
I have no idea what he wants.

06:32.811 --> 06:36.727
See, who's the perfect bride now?

06:36.728 --> 06:41.019
And, what is Jordan gonna
eat for dinner tonight?

06:42.561 --> 06:44.935
What is Jordan gonna have
for dinner when he gets home

06:44.936 --> 06:47.018
from a long day of
work at the hospital

06:47.019 --> 06:49.643
and all those long hours
of studying at school,

06:49.644 --> 06:53.851
while you sit here and eat
pad Thai and drink Chianti?

06:53.852 --> 06:57.018
You didn't order
anything for him.

06:57.019 --> 07:01.142
- I see no perfect bride here, Missy.
- Well, you distracted me.

07:01.143 --> 07:05.102
I was gonna cook him something,
but you just showed up.

07:05.103 --> 07:08.353
Sure, blame it
on the best friend.

07:14.769 --> 07:16.686
Sounds to me like
this bridal boot camp

07:16.687 --> 07:18.351
could do you some good too.

07:18.352 --> 07:20.851
Don't think I don't see
what you're trying to do here,

07:20.852 --> 07:23.393
thwart me into another
one of your absurd ideas,

07:23.394 --> 07:24.810
'cause I don't need it.

07:24.811 --> 07:29.560
Miss perfect bride is gonna make
her fiancee the perfect BLT.

07:31.477 --> 07:36.144
- Lady, step away from the bacon.
- You know what, I'm outta here.

07:36.145 --> 07:38.394
You can keep it, bye.

07:38.395 --> 07:41.478
- Love you baby.
- Love you too.

07:47.394 --> 07:49.978
Hey there, how was your day?

07:53.769 --> 07:55.268
Hi.

07:55.269 --> 07:58.725
The OR was awful, there
was a really bad accident

07:58.726 --> 08:00.142
with multiple cars on the ten.

08:00.143 --> 08:04.435
- Oh honey, I'm so sorry.
- It's fine, I'm better now.

08:05.769 --> 08:10.393
- So, what are you watching?
- Hor deaurves on display.

08:10.394 --> 08:12.351
Just getting ideas
for our spread.

08:12.352 --> 08:13.768
Oh, well, wait a minute.

08:13.769 --> 08:16.394
I thought you wanted
a three course dinner.

08:16.395 --> 08:19.184
No, we changed it
last week, remember?

08:19.185 --> 08:21.643
I don't wanna serve steak and
have the vegans up in arms,

08:21.644 --> 08:23.935
or serve pasta and have the
gluten free's freakin' out.

08:23.936 --> 08:26.226
- Right.
- So, I told you this.

08:26.227 --> 08:27.977
I know, I'm sorry, it's
just been a long week.

08:27.978 --> 08:33.558
- Cardiovascular quiz got you down?
- No, pulmonary is this month.

08:33.559 --> 08:36.936
Cardio, cardio, was last month.

08:36.937 --> 08:39.102
- That's right.
- Right.

08:39.102 --> 08:40.767
Sorry, so many wedding
things on my mind.

08:40.768 --> 08:43.433
That's fine, it's just
boring stuff anyway.

08:43.434 --> 08:44.935
It's not boring.

08:44.936 --> 08:46.810
- Babe.
- I love your work.

08:46.811 --> 08:48.893
It's my job, and I
even find it boring.

08:48.894 --> 08:51.101
And not to mention, you
get all grimacy and stuff

08:51.102 --> 08:54.143
when I even get graphic
about what we do in the OR,

08:54.144 --> 08:56.144
so give me that, okay?

08:57.560 --> 08:59.310
- Okay.
- Wait!

08:59.311 --> 09:02.518
- What?
- I made you dinner.

09:02.519 --> 09:04.142
But you don't even cook.

09:04.143 --> 09:05.642
We might as well start,

09:05.643 --> 09:09.227
'cause we don't wanna be ordering
take out every night for our kids.

09:10.310 --> 09:13.143
Okay, yeah, sure, so what is it?

09:13.144 --> 09:16.228
- It's a BLT, try it.
- A BLT!

09:17.978 --> 09:19.977
Well babe, I mean,
it looks great.

09:21.186 --> 09:24.477
But, you do know
I don't eat mayo, right?

09:25.978 --> 09:29.268
Yeah I mean, you know,
it's just so fatty and...

09:29.269 --> 09:31.268
You know, I don't
like the taste.

09:31.269 --> 09:33.477
- Since when?
- Since ever.

09:34.352 --> 09:38.309
- How did I not know this?
- Babe, come on, it's fine.

09:38.310 --> 09:41.518
Look, we've only been together
a little over a year,

09:41.519 --> 09:42.851
I'm pretty sure there
are lots of things

09:42.852 --> 09:44.518
we don't know about each other.

09:44.519 --> 09:47.351
You can't expect to know everything
about one another, can we now?

09:47.352 --> 09:49.309
We're not perfect.

09:49.310 --> 09:50.976
Look, I'm gonna go get a shower,

09:50.977 --> 09:54.394
and hit the sack because
I am tired and exhausted,

09:54.395 --> 09:56.267
and I wanna get
up in the morning,

09:56.268 --> 09:58.768
and go to the gym before
I go to class, okay?

09:58.769 --> 10:02.059
- Do you wanna come with?
- Yeah, I'll be right there.

10:02.060 --> 10:03.060
Yeah?

10:04.435 --> 10:08.601
Thanks for the sandwich.

10:10.436 --> 10:11.976
We're not perfect?

10:11.977 --> 10:14.559
I think what he
meant to say was,

10:14.560 --> 10:17.434
he didn't expect you
to be all-knowing,

10:17.435 --> 10:19.060
even though you like
to think you are.

10:19.061 --> 10:21.101
I don't think I'm all knowing.

10:21.102 --> 10:23.768
But I did think that I knew
everything about Jordan.

10:23.769 --> 10:25.977
I know that he misses
high school baseball,

10:25.978 --> 10:28.476
I know that his favorite
color is turquoise,

10:28.477 --> 10:30.602
I know that he always
washes his hands twice

10:30.603 --> 10:33.017
cause it's work habit, and
I know that he secretly

10:33.018 --> 10:36.018
tries to avoid cuddling
because we both run cold,

10:36.019 --> 10:39.892
but this mayo thing...
It just cuts deep.

10:39.893 --> 10:43.518
Andy, I just think you're making
a big deal out of nothing, okay?

10:43.519 --> 10:45.559
I can't even tell you what
color Troy's eyes are,

10:45.560 --> 10:47.227
much less his favorite color.

10:47.228 --> 10:48.517
Clearly I missed the mark here.

10:48.518 --> 10:51.977
I mean, how could I marry someone
I didn't know hates mayo?

10:51.978 --> 10:55.102
So what, you're just gonna call off
your wedding over a bad BLT?

10:55.103 --> 10:57.851
No, of course not, just...

10:57.852 --> 11:01.935
Maybe, you were right for
once, about this boot camp.

11:01.936 --> 11:04.101
Maybe it's something
we should try.

11:04.102 --> 11:06.476
I was thinking about
that again this morning,

11:06.477 --> 11:09.102
and I just think it
sounds a bit too much.

11:09.103 --> 11:11.810
I went on the website, and
they said we have to wear heels

11:11.811 --> 11:13.893
the whole time for
reception rehearsal,

11:13.894 --> 11:16.267
and I can barely make it
around this park in flats.

11:16.268 --> 11:18.476
So, I think we just jump
the gun on that one, okay?

11:18.477 --> 11:20.142
Felice, it was your idea.

11:20.143 --> 11:22.226
Yeah, that was before
I found these water pills

11:22.227 --> 11:24.267
that you can take the
night before your wedding.

11:24.268 --> 11:26.435
They make you go like...

11:27.768 --> 11:29.267
Okay, okay fine.

11:29.268 --> 11:31.643
But, I looked up that
Whitney Walsh last night,

11:31.644 --> 11:33.185
and I was wrong about her.

11:33.186 --> 11:35.142
She's not just some
rich housewife.

11:35.143 --> 11:38.558
No, she made a fortune throwing
all these famous people weddings

11:38.559 --> 11:40.642
after years of being
their yoga instructor.

11:40.643 --> 11:42.601
So, maybe she has
some great tips

11:42.602 --> 11:44.309
about how to throw
a good wedding?

11:44.310 --> 11:46.475
Even if the camp
itself is a joke.

11:46.476 --> 11:51.392
Okay, but I'm not wearing heels,
alright, that's how hammer toes are made.

11:51.393 --> 11:52.685
You're the relationship columnist

11:52.686 --> 11:54.976
that wants to run an
article on me, correct?

11:54.977 --> 11:58.309
- With your permission, of course.
- Sure, I love free press.

11:58.310 --> 12:00.978
Tell me, June, did
you go to work today?

12:02.019 --> 12:04.059
And this is what you wore?

12:04.060 --> 12:07.725
- Did you borrow it from your fiancee?
- I got it on sale at blooming...

12:07.726 --> 12:09.475
Did you buy it in
the men's section?

12:09.476 --> 12:11.600
I just don't understand
what a men's business suit

12:11.601 --> 12:13.559
would be doing in
the women's aisle.

12:13.560 --> 12:15.434
I don't think it's a men's...

12:15.435 --> 12:18.227
Does your paper have
a fashion columnist?

12:18.228 --> 12:22.017
And does she ever, tease you
about what you wear to work?

12:22.018 --> 12:25.185
Duncan, and yes,
he does, sometimes.

12:27.977 --> 12:30.518
If your fashion columnist
wouldn't wear it to work,

12:30.519 --> 12:32.143
neither should you.

12:36.268 --> 12:37.726
- Hi.
- Hi.

12:37.727 --> 12:40.518
You've been
married before, yeah?

12:40.519 --> 12:42.059
Yeah.

12:42.060 --> 12:43.934
If you screwed it
up the first time,

12:43.935 --> 12:47.726
what makes you think you
can make it work this time?

12:47.727 --> 12:51.769
Okay go, just go.
Hey, get back here!

12:53.768 --> 12:57.724
You need to learn how to stick up
for yourself. Fight back.

12:57.725 --> 12:58.725
Okay.

13:02.227 --> 13:04.433
Okay sister wives.

13:04.434 --> 13:06.517
You think what I said
was so funny?

13:06.518 --> 13:10.684
Because you're so young, and cute,
and you're marrying your college sweeties?

13:10.685 --> 13:11.892
No, not at all.

13:11.893 --> 13:15.558
No it's not that, it's just that,
we love your pinterest board.

13:15.559 --> 13:19.892
Well guess what, you
can't pin the perfect marriage.

13:19.893 --> 13:22.601
So wipe that smile off your face.

13:25.060 --> 13:28.225
OCD elementary school teacher.

13:28.226 --> 13:31.141
That's me, my name is Wendy Day,

13:31.142 --> 13:35.809
my students call me Miss Day,
but you guys can call me Wendy.

13:35.810 --> 13:40.018
Just don't call me on
a Wendy day.

13:41.852 --> 13:44.393
Felice Davis,
Whitney Walsh protege.

13:44.394 --> 13:47.310
Executive assistant,
finance firm, impressive.

13:48.519 --> 13:52.309
Now you need to
work on becoming VP.

13:52.310 --> 13:55.933
- And you must be our resident skeptic.
- Excuse me?

13:55.934 --> 13:58.142
Andy Phillips,
design entrepreneur.

13:58.143 --> 14:00.600
Tell me miss Phillips,
why don't you think

14:00.601 --> 14:03.184
you can benefit from
our program here?

14:03.185 --> 14:06.184
Well, honestly, I thought
that I could be a good bride

14:06.185 --> 14:07.934
by just being myself.

14:07.935 --> 14:10.517
So you just came for moral
support for your friend here.

14:10.518 --> 14:13.101
Well, then I
thought, "Why not?"

14:13.102 --> 14:17.891
- Maybe I could improve myself here.
- Good, I think you can.

14:17.892 --> 14:19.601
I think you all can.

14:20.726 --> 14:23.558
With my week-long crash course,

14:23.559 --> 14:27.183
you will all learn what it
takes to be the perfect bride.

14:27.184 --> 14:31.059
You'll leave here with
less fat, more confidence,

14:31.060 --> 14:36.726
and a one way ticket to a long,
happy, lasting marriage like mine.

14:36.727 --> 14:40.226
Ladies, this is my husband,
Preston Walsh.

14:41.893 --> 14:45.184
You may have stayed
at one of his five star hotels,

14:45.185 --> 14:48.891
but, fancy hotels
and long ski weekends

14:48.892 --> 14:52.767
are not what makes
a marriage special.

14:52.768 --> 14:55.059
So what does then, exactly?

14:55.060 --> 14:57.725
All the amazing things
that I've learned from it,

14:57.726 --> 15:01.936
which, I'm going to share
exclusively with all of you,

15:02.768 --> 15:04.893
with my bridal boot camp.

15:06.059 --> 15:08.935
Rule number one,
know your fiancee.

15:10.018 --> 15:11.933
Duh, kind of a given.

15:11.934 --> 15:16.433
You wanna keep your hubby happy?
You gotta know how he ticks.

15:16.434 --> 15:19.892
For example, Preston
hates mismatching socks.

15:19.893 --> 15:22.767
He loves green tea
with milk over coffee.

15:22.768 --> 15:26.059
Even though he works
crazier hours than I do,

15:26.060 --> 15:27.934
I know that our morning
workout together

15:27.935 --> 15:32.102
is what keeps him sane, which
leads me to rule number two.

15:33.185 --> 15:34.433
Look good.

15:34.434 --> 15:37.433
Men care moreso about
how we look than we do.

15:37.434 --> 15:39.934
They want a woman
that other men covet,

15:39.935 --> 15:43.142
so look good, they stay happy.

15:43.143 --> 15:44.143
Right, June?

15:45.477 --> 15:47.684
Easy for her to say,
she was clearly born

15:47.685 --> 15:50.016
with those cheekbones
and those legs.

15:50.017 --> 15:52.642
Rule number three, settle down.

15:52.643 --> 15:55.016
Maybe he isn't your
dream guy, so what?

15:55.017 --> 15:58.475
Fairy tales have lied to us
for far too long, ladies.

15:58.476 --> 16:01.475
There is no prince charming.

16:01.476 --> 16:04.808
There are only unstable
men, or stable men

16:04.809 --> 16:08.350
that can be who you want
them to be, if you let them.

16:08.351 --> 16:10.809
So, no more ideas
about prince charming,

16:10.810 --> 16:13.392
and no flirting with men
who you think are princes,

16:13.393 --> 16:15.893
'cause guess what?
They're not.

16:16.977 --> 16:18.643
Four, be interested.

16:20.059 --> 16:22.724
Be able to talk about
a variety of subjects,

16:22.725 --> 16:26.558
like religion,
sports, even politics,

16:26.559 --> 16:28.725
and be able to talk
about his work too.

16:28.726 --> 16:30.725
Talk intelligently about it.

16:30.726 --> 16:34.392
You will undoubtedly have
a multitude of differences,

16:34.393 --> 16:38.059
and if he can tolerate
yours, you can tolerate his.

16:38.060 --> 16:42.975
Which brings me to number five.
Stay strong, ladies.

16:42.976 --> 16:45.308
No one likes that messy mom
in line at the grocery store

16:45.309 --> 16:48.642
with her kids running everywhere,
wrinkled clothes, bags under her eyes.

16:48.643 --> 16:50.558
Don't be that woman!

16:50.559 --> 16:52.850
If we don't like her,
do you really think

16:52.851 --> 16:55.017
the man that lives
with her will?

16:55.018 --> 17:00.184
- Why not tell us how you really feel?
- Something to say there, skeptic?

17:02.559 --> 17:06.224
'Cause I've got sonar hearing,
and just because you're cute,

17:06.226 --> 17:09.476
doesn't mean you can
beat my boot camp.

17:10.559 --> 17:13.224
Here are your
regimens for the week.

17:13.226 --> 17:15.348
Please do not faint.

17:15.349 --> 17:19.851
I assure you, you can all survive it,
if you try hard enough.

17:20.892 --> 17:23.767
So, who's ready to get started?

17:36.142 --> 17:38.309
Kappa kappa won't be back.

17:46.393 --> 17:49.474
Hey, how long you
gonna be around?

17:49.475 --> 17:50.809
A little while.

17:50.810 --> 17:53.266
I can stay until that
flower delivery arrives.

17:53.267 --> 17:54.766
You sure?

17:54.767 --> 17:56.642
Yeah, just lock the
front door and put a note,

17:56.643 --> 17:58.184
tell the guy to come round back.

17:58.185 --> 18:00.183
By the way, before I go,

18:00.184 --> 18:03.183
come with me up front, there's
something I want you to try.

18:03.184 --> 18:04.184
Okay.

18:07.309 --> 18:09.392
This one is divine.

18:09.393 --> 18:11.267
I swear I'm gonna renew my
nuptials with your father

18:11.268 --> 18:13.433
just so I can buy this
insanely expensive cake.

18:14.934 --> 18:17.933
I was right, it's all
about the dolce de leche.

18:17.934 --> 18:19.225
That's the one.

18:19.226 --> 18:21.601
Oh, shoot, it's late,
I gotta run.

18:21.602 --> 18:23.767
Your daddy's cooking me dinner,
and I don't wanna spoil it.

18:23.768 --> 18:26.141
Spoil it?
You mean, he spoils you.

18:26.142 --> 18:28.558
Sometimes.

18:28.559 --> 18:32.308
Sometimes it's just an apology
for leaving the toilet seat up.

18:32.309 --> 18:34.266
- I love you.
- Tell dad Hi for me.

18:34.267 --> 18:35.351
I will.

19:01.267 --> 19:02.267
Oh well,

19:04.600 --> 19:05.601
more for me.

19:09.476 --> 19:11.016
What'd you forget?

19:11.017 --> 19:16.016
If you came back for more cake,
think again, this is all mine.

19:16.017 --> 19:18.641
I wouldn't dream
of taking your cake.

19:18.642 --> 19:20.308
It's clearly spoken for.

19:20.309 --> 19:23.307
Sorry, I thought
you were my mom.

19:23.308 --> 19:25.516
Nope, just
delivering the flowers.

19:25.517 --> 19:28.016
Well, we usually have
them come around back.

19:28.017 --> 19:31.265
The front was open, and the
lights are still on, so I...

19:31.266 --> 19:33.308
It's fine, can you
bring them over here?

19:33.309 --> 19:34.684
Yeah.

19:34.685 --> 19:36.516
Thanks, are you new?

19:36.517 --> 19:39.141
I've never seen you before.
What happened to Tiffany?

19:39.142 --> 19:43.100
I'm not new, no,
but I don't usually deliver.

19:43.101 --> 19:46.183
Tiffany is out on leave
for a little while.

19:46.184 --> 19:48.308
She and her husband
just adopted a little boy.

19:48.309 --> 19:50.642
Oh really?
That is so sweet.

19:51.351 --> 19:53.724
I knew she was trying,
but I didn't know they were adopting.

19:53.725 --> 19:55.684
Yeah, it all
happened kinda quickly.

19:55.685 --> 19:58.558
She got really lucky,
we're happy for her.

19:58.559 --> 20:00.600
Okay, I got it.

20:00.601 --> 20:03.100
Did my mom ask you to
arrange the vases for us?

20:03.101 --> 20:05.391
'Cause we usually
do that ourselves.

20:05.392 --> 20:07.766
Oh well, you're
more than welcome to.

20:07.767 --> 20:12.142
I just, thought you seemed
a little preoccupied with the feeding.

20:14.643 --> 20:16.058
Feeding?

20:16.059 --> 20:20.266
I am cake taste testing,
thank you very much.

20:20.267 --> 20:23.267
And, I wasn't going to
finish all this by myself.

20:26.350 --> 20:32.391
- What, enjoying my cake much?
- Vanilla cream, that's very good.

20:32.392 --> 20:34.601
But you're not a vanilla girl,
are you?

20:36.226 --> 20:37.226
Hey!

20:39.101 --> 20:41.934
Now that's the one, that's the one.
Is that the one?

20:41.935 --> 20:43.432
I...

20:43.433 --> 20:44.641
Wait, wait, you said you
weren't going to finish.

20:44.642 --> 20:47.393
Well, I was gonna
finish that one.

20:49.600 --> 20:52.557
Is that the one you're
gonna serve on your big day?

20:52.558 --> 20:55.099
It's a pretty big decision,
better make it a good one.

20:55.100 --> 20:58.349
What, you think cake taste
testing is some kind of joke?

20:58.350 --> 20:59.351
I think...

21:01.600 --> 21:04.351
I think I'm gonna
be leaving now.

21:05.725 --> 21:09.350
Hey.
You do, don't you?

21:09.351 --> 21:10.849
Hey!

21:10.850 --> 21:12.850
You do, don't you?

21:12.851 --> 21:14.391
It's not so much that I think

21:14.392 --> 21:18.601
cake taste testing is a joke,
as much as I think that,

21:20.016 --> 21:22.849
well, weddings are
kind of a joke.

21:22.850 --> 21:25.433
You think weddings are a joke?

21:25.434 --> 21:28.140
You think marriage
is some kind of joke?

21:28.141 --> 21:31.182
Well, not to be the negative
Nancy before your big day,

21:31.183 --> 21:34.933
but the US divorce rate
does seem to agree.

21:34.934 --> 21:37.516
Fine, don't get married.

21:37.517 --> 21:39.891
Great, I don't plan to.

21:39.892 --> 21:41.808
But don't spoil it
for the rest of us

21:41.809 --> 21:43.932
who do actually
believe in marriage

21:43.933 --> 21:45.808
and think it's a
beautiful thing.

21:45.809 --> 21:49.100
I mean, this is my whole life,
it's where I work, what I do.

21:49.101 --> 21:51.433
And you seem to be
very talented at it.

21:51.434 --> 21:54.849
Listen, I'm really sorry
if I offended you, okay?

21:54.850 --> 21:58.807
And hey, congratulations
on your big day, seriously.

21:58.808 --> 22:01.933
I'm sure he's a very
lucky man to have you.

22:01.934 --> 22:03.599
He is.

22:03.600 --> 22:04.600
Great.

22:06.850 --> 22:08.225
Can I go now?

22:10.266 --> 22:11.266
Yes.

22:15.766 --> 22:20.182
It's very nice to meet you,
Andrea Phillips.

22:20.183 --> 22:25.557
- Andy, it's Andy.
- Great, I go by Casey.

22:25.558 --> 22:26.558
Goodnight.

22:36.017 --> 22:39.307
And then he's like,
"Divorce rates seem to agree".

22:39.308 --> 22:43.474
I mean, seriously, he is a
Connor's Flowers delivery guy.

22:43.475 --> 22:45.725
Shouldn't he be more pleasant?

22:47.226 --> 22:49.891
I mean, that's like what
a flower delivery service

22:49.892 --> 22:54.140
is supposed to promote,
love, romance, anniversaries,

22:54.141 --> 22:57.432
the occasional funeral,
but, mostly love.

22:57.433 --> 23:01.267
Why would they even hire
such a deputy downer?

23:02.308 --> 23:04.101
Jordan, Jordan.

23:05.642 --> 23:08.140
I thought we were gonna stay up
and watch a movie tonight.

23:08.141 --> 23:11.724
How about you put one on,
and I just rest my eyes for a bit.

23:11.725 --> 23:15.141
You seriously
will not stay up with me?

23:17.308 --> 23:21.932
I will stay up with you,
if you get up with me

23:21.933 --> 23:24.140
at 5:30 in the morning
and go to the gym.

23:24.141 --> 23:26.932
That is not fair, you know
how much I hate the gym.

23:26.933 --> 23:28.432
Please?

23:28.433 --> 23:30.391
Baby, you are really cold,
you're like a refrigerator.

23:30.392 --> 23:34.976
- Yep, and you are a freezer burn.
- Oh come on, look, hey.

23:37.267 --> 23:40.808
Come on, can we just watch
a movie another night?

23:40.809 --> 23:41.809
Yep.

23:42.684 --> 23:45.350
- Love you.
- Love you.

23:47.183 --> 23:49.349
You smell good.

23:51.724 --> 23:53.557
Are you feeling it yet?

23:53.558 --> 23:55.141
Well that's nothing
compared to the pain

23:55.142 --> 23:57.432
you're gonna endure
doing childbirth.

23:57.433 --> 23:58.433
Nothing!

23:59.683 --> 24:01.015
Compared to the pain
I'm gonna put her through

24:01.016 --> 24:04.307
when she's not looking.
She doesn't even have kids.

24:04.308 --> 24:06.766
Yeah but, can't you see
the future brochures?

24:06.767 --> 24:08.558
"Mommy body boot camp".

24:13.392 --> 24:15.557
Wendy darling, do you
remember what I said

24:15.558 --> 24:19.473
would happen to one who could
not hold their yoga pose?

24:19.474 --> 24:23.349
One would have to skip cake
eating etiquette on Wednesday.

24:23.350 --> 24:26.307
Well, I hope you don't like cake.

24:26.308 --> 24:27.974
I love it.

24:27.975 --> 24:31.766
Alright ladies, downward dog,
let's see it.

24:33.141 --> 24:34.599
And do you think you
could have done this pose

24:34.600 --> 24:38.182
in the band-aid of a dress that
you were wearing yesterday?

24:38.183 --> 24:39.183
Exactly.

24:41.474 --> 24:44.641
Your downward dog
looks like dead dog!

24:45.934 --> 24:46.934
Stop crying!

24:51.058 --> 24:52.640
Everyone, look at Andy.

24:52.641 --> 24:55.265
This is how a downward dog pose
is supposed to look.

24:55.266 --> 24:56.350
Be like Andy.

24:57.350 --> 24:58.517
Butt-kisser.

24:59.516 --> 25:01.848
You know I do yoga at home.

25:01.849 --> 25:03.183
If I wasn't busy eating hair,

25:03.184 --> 25:05.432
you'd see the look of
contempt on my face.

25:05.433 --> 25:08.517
Don't be like that, Felice.
We're here to learn, remember?

25:08.518 --> 25:10.015
Patience in stuff like this

25:10.016 --> 25:12.348
will make you more patient
in your marriage too.

25:12.349 --> 25:16.891
Don't give me that.
I frickin' hate this boot camp.

25:16.892 --> 25:19.850
Okay ladies, you can relax.

25:22.933 --> 25:24.517
That was pathetic.

25:25.557 --> 25:28.307
Everyone put one on please.

25:28.308 --> 25:30.891
These are what I like to call,
truth veils.

25:30.892 --> 25:32.265
Anyone know why?

25:32.266 --> 25:35.349
Because once you get married,
the veils come off,

25:35.350 --> 25:37.598
and all of your hopes, and fears,

25:37.599 --> 25:39.723
and all your fatal flaws
that you've been hiding

25:39.724 --> 25:43.932
from your husbands since the day
you met, will be revealed to him.

25:43.933 --> 25:46.932
So we're gonna practice
opening up to each other.

25:46.933 --> 25:50.433
Who would like to share
their fears first?

25:54.058 --> 25:55.058
Wendy.

25:58.392 --> 26:00.475
So sorry, I'm so sorry.

26:02.724 --> 26:03.724
Oh god.

26:06.350 --> 26:08.683
My biggest fear, is
that I won't have

26:08.684 --> 26:11.891
enough hours in the day to
take care of my kids at school,

26:11.892 --> 26:14.099
plus my kiddos at home,

26:14.100 --> 26:15.933
and still keep my Rob
a happy camper.

26:17.933 --> 26:19.932
And how would you combat
those fears?

26:19.933 --> 26:21.266
Umm, caffeine.

26:22.141 --> 26:25.557
No, no caffeine, Wendy.
No caffeine.

26:25.558 --> 26:29.307
I think you know where
your real fears lie.

26:29.724 --> 26:30.724
I do?

26:33.225 --> 26:34.932
Go ahead, share with everyone

26:34.933 --> 26:38.849
what happens when you
get anxious or nervous.

26:38.850 --> 26:43.307
- Go on, share.
- Fine, I eat when I get nervous.

26:45.266 --> 26:48.599
Okay, so I think
your real fears are simply based

26:48.600 --> 26:51.182
in no longer being
desired by your husband,

26:51.183 --> 26:55.474
so you need to find a solution that
does not involve emotional eating.

26:55.475 --> 26:57.723
- Can you do that?
- Yes.

26:57.724 --> 27:01.473
Lorelei, your turn.
I think you know your problem too.

27:01.474 --> 27:02.474
I do.

27:03.350 --> 27:04.723
It's men.

27:04.724 --> 27:06.723
Up until now,
I've been afraid to commit.

27:06.724 --> 27:09.474
I mean, what if I cheat on Rick
with a sexy pilot

27:09.475 --> 27:12.474
I used to date,
who was no good for me?

27:12.475 --> 27:13.681
That's a good question.

27:13.682 --> 27:16.307
What would happen if
you did cheat on him?

27:16.308 --> 27:18.641
I might lose him, forever.

27:19.683 --> 27:23.808
Yeah, it's a possibility.
How can we fix it?

27:23.809 --> 27:25.181
Find another job?

27:25.182 --> 27:30.141
No Lorelei, we don't run from
our problems, we confront them.

27:31.349 --> 27:35.432
We confront our fears,
do you know how?

27:35.433 --> 27:36.683
I don't know.

27:37.683 --> 27:40.556
You go up to that sexy pilot,

27:40.557 --> 27:44.016
and you tell him that
he is no good for you,

27:44.017 --> 27:47.390
and that he's got nothing
on your husband now.

27:47.391 --> 27:50.682
Truth be told, he's
much sexier than my Rick,

27:50.683 --> 27:52.682
and when he tips
his hat off at me,

27:52.683 --> 27:56.640
with those sexy wings on the side,
my insides just go crazy and I...

27:56.641 --> 28:00.974
- And you will have self-control.
- But how?

28:00.975 --> 28:05.181
- Sometimes it's just so hard.
- I have an idea.

28:05.182 --> 28:08.808
What if, every time you saw
the wings on that pilot's hat,

28:08.809 --> 28:10.723
you thought of your Rick,

28:10.724 --> 28:13.014
because he's the one
you ended up with

28:13.015 --> 28:17.389
and he's the one who really
gives you wings to fly?

28:17.390 --> 28:19.890
It's true, my Rick is a gem.

28:19.891 --> 28:22.265
That's poetic, but let's try

28:22.266 --> 28:26.223
to keep our strategies based
in reality, yeah, okay?

28:26.224 --> 28:27.892
Felice, you're next.

28:29.891 --> 28:33.765
Well, my fears are that

28:33.766 --> 28:37.224
I am too selfish, because
I'm the only child.

28:37.225 --> 28:39.889
And what's your plan of attack?

28:39.890 --> 28:44.015
Well, to do something nice
for him once a month.

28:46.016 --> 28:48.223
Okay well, once a week?

28:48.224 --> 28:51.014
But, I think we can do
something nice

28:51.015 --> 28:53.306
for the one we're
with every day, right?

28:53.307 --> 28:55.473
I mean, whether it's
surprise baseball tickets

28:55.474 --> 28:58.140
or even just a kiss on the cheek,

28:58.141 --> 29:01.475
I think that every
day is a better goal.

29:02.891 --> 29:06.890
Okay so, what are your
big fears, miss gives-a-lot?

29:06.891 --> 29:09.891
Fine, my fear is fearlessness,

29:11.015 --> 29:15.100
because sometimes I worry
that Jordan and me are too perfect.

29:16.100 --> 29:17.598
That's not a real fear.

29:17.599 --> 29:22.014
You know what I think?
I think your real fear, is in yourself.

29:22.015 --> 29:26.764
See, I think I know
myself pretty well, so...

29:26.765 --> 29:30.974
Really, then tell us,
why are you here?

29:30.975 --> 29:37.598
Well, at first it was just for Felice
but, now it's to prove you wrong.

29:37.599 --> 29:40.431
Well then, I look forward to it.

29:53.474 --> 29:56.974
- Hey Andrea.
- Just Andy.

29:56.975 --> 29:58.975
- So, when's the big day?
- June 29th.

29:58.976 --> 30:00.223
So soon.

30:00.224 --> 30:03.348
Yeah, but Felice's is
in six weeks, May 18th.

30:03.349 --> 30:08.390
Best friends planning a wedding
together, is that not competitive?

30:08.391 --> 30:14.973
No, it's fine,
I'm making her wedding dress.

30:14.974 --> 30:16.472
You're making her dress too?

30:16.473 --> 30:19.431
Yeah, that's what I do,
I make wedding dresses.

30:19.432 --> 30:23.057
You didn't say that on your application,
it just said entrepreneur, where?

30:23.058 --> 30:25.014
My mom's shop, Bonnie's Bridal.

30:25.015 --> 30:28.014
Bonnie's Bridal, yeah
I've heard of that place.

30:28.015 --> 30:31.348
It's a treasure trove for
brides on a budget, huh?

30:31.349 --> 30:33.516
And I'm assuming you're
making your own dress too?

30:35.266 --> 30:37.848
The perpetual perfectionist.

30:37.849 --> 30:40.682
Always wants the
perfect everything.

30:40.683 --> 30:45.683
Well, I'll let you get to it.
I'll see you tomorrow, or not.

30:58.890 --> 31:01.806
You and Whitney make nice?
I think she really likes you.

31:01.807 --> 31:04.765
What?
She clearly hates me.

31:04.766 --> 31:08.556
I can't tell, you had
such wonderful input today.

31:08.557 --> 31:11.306
Okay, look, I didn't
mean to sound preachy but,

31:11.307 --> 31:13.431
you're the one who admitted
you can be selfish.

31:13.432 --> 31:15.306
Yeah, but sometimes
you need to be.

31:15.307 --> 31:18.223
You can't always just
be worried about Jordan.

31:18.224 --> 31:19.224
Or Felice.

31:21.556 --> 31:24.056
So how about, I
finish your dress,

31:24.057 --> 31:27.223
and then I selfishly
start making mine?

31:27.224 --> 31:29.307
I can't wait to see 'em both!

31:45.848 --> 31:47.182
Hello?

31:51.098 --> 31:52.807
Oh, geez!

31:52.808 --> 31:56.598
Oh, god, you nearly
gave me a heart attack!

31:56.599 --> 31:58.264
And look, I messed up my dress.

31:58.265 --> 32:01.224
I said hello when I walked
in, you just didn't hear me.

32:01.225 --> 32:03.056
Well, what were
you doing sneaking

32:03.057 --> 32:04.597
through our back door like that?

32:04.598 --> 32:07.305
Yesterday you told me not
to come in through the front.

32:07.306 --> 32:08.764
If not the front or the back,

32:08.765 --> 32:12.806
I'm not really sure how
you expect me to get in.

32:12.807 --> 32:17.515
- Are you always this disgruntled?
- No, I'm just tired.

32:17.516 --> 32:20.515
It's this new workout regimen
I'm doing,

32:20.516 --> 32:22.098
and I didn't know
you were coming back.

32:22.099 --> 32:25.223
My mom usually orders one
delivery a week, so...

32:25.224 --> 32:26.639
Must be a busy week.

32:26.640 --> 32:30.515
Right, well, thank
you, these are very nice.

32:30.516 --> 32:35.389
Oh, shoot, I'm bleeding.
Sewing machine got me.

32:35.390 --> 32:39.681
- You okay?
- Yeah, it's just a little pin prick.

32:39.682 --> 32:42.181
I'll be fine by tomorrow.

32:42.182 --> 32:44.473
Alright, well I am sorry.

32:44.474 --> 32:46.264
And hey, let me
make it up to you.

32:46.265 --> 32:47.806
Are you hungry?

32:47.807 --> 32:50.138
'Cause there's a really good
pizza place down the street,

32:50.139 --> 32:53.306
and I don't know about
you but, I'm starving.

32:53.307 --> 32:54.890
No, I'm good.

32:56.140 --> 32:58.305
I am engaged, remember?

32:58.306 --> 33:01.056
So I don't exactly dine
with other men.

33:01.057 --> 33:04.806
Well I wasn't exactly
asking you out on a date.

33:04.807 --> 33:08.056
Could be delivery for all I care.

33:08.057 --> 33:10.264
I'm just hungry, and I figured,

33:10.265 --> 33:13.473
since you're here working,
maybe you were too.

33:13.474 --> 33:17.305
Okay, delivery, but
this is platonic dining,

33:17.306 --> 33:21.307
- because I'm engaged, remember?
- Yeah.

33:21.308 --> 33:25.764
- Casey, is it?
- Yes, Casey, engaged, and yeah,

33:25.765 --> 33:29.932
same goes for you, Missy,
no funny business, okay?

33:30.890 --> 33:34.290
- What do you want on your pizza?
- Pepperoni.

33:34.490 --> 33:35.390
Alright.

33:36.515 --> 33:39.430
I cannot remember
the last time I had pizza.

33:39.431 --> 33:43.807
My fiancee likes to eat pretty
healthy, so pizza's a no.

33:43.808 --> 33:48.807
No pizza?
You are madly deprived.

33:48.808 --> 33:52.722
- It's okay.
- Your greasy chin says otherwise.

33:55.390 --> 33:59.222
Well, thank you for the pizza,
and company.

33:59.223 --> 34:02.764
My fiance works in an OR and
is in med school right now,

34:02.765 --> 34:05.555
so I eat most of
my meals by myself.

34:05.556 --> 34:08.098
Well, there are
worse places to dine.

34:08.099 --> 34:09.597
How long have you worked here?

34:09.598 --> 34:12.389
Feels like forever,
since my mom owns the place,

34:12.389 --> 34:15.806
and she started working
here when she was my age so,

34:15.806 --> 34:17.888
I pretty much grew up here.

34:17.889 --> 34:21.556
And is dress making what
you've always wanted to do?

34:21.556 --> 34:24.681
It's the only thing
I've ever really known.

34:24.681 --> 34:27.389
I mean, I thought about wedding
planning in high school,

34:27.391 --> 34:29.514
but I just love design.

34:29.514 --> 34:32.429
How about you, how long have you
been in the flower business?

34:32.431 --> 34:34.514
It's been about a year now.

34:34.514 --> 34:37.554
- Still kind of a new venture.
- And what'd you do before this?

34:37.556 --> 34:41.098
I was working
at a big marketing company.

34:41.099 --> 34:45.263
Kinda cutthroat, crazy hours,
high stress.

34:45.264 --> 34:47.764
Not for me in the end,
I don't guess.

34:47.764 --> 34:51.264
But, delivering flowers
for Connor's is?

34:52.891 --> 34:55.304
You say that like
you're judging me.

34:55.306 --> 34:57.097
I'm sorry, no I don't mean that,

34:57.098 --> 35:00.181
it's just, guess I was
wondering how you plan on

35:00.182 --> 35:04.431
providing for a family with
a delivery guy's salary.

35:04.432 --> 35:10.805
That's right, you think weddings
and marriage are silly.

35:10.806 --> 35:16.722
Okay, hey, I never said I had a problem
with commitment or family, okay?

35:16.723 --> 35:18.430
I want both of those things.

35:18.431 --> 35:22.555
Just without all the legal protections
and paperwork mumbo jumbo?

35:22.556 --> 35:25.180
Now you're just putting
words into my mouth.

35:25.181 --> 35:31.098
I just don't think that a lotta
people think before they tie the knot.

35:31.099 --> 35:34.099
Or, you just don't wanna commit.

35:35.765 --> 35:36.973
What?

35:36.974 --> 35:38.263
You said it yourself,
you couldn't commit

35:38.264 --> 35:40.348
to that marketing job,
so maybe your feelings

35:40.349 --> 35:42.806
are the same about
family and marriage.

35:42.807 --> 35:45.514
Well, think what you
want, Andrea Phillips,

35:45.515 --> 35:49.138
but I'm pretty sure had I
kept that job in marketing,

35:49.139 --> 35:54.056
I would've never had time for a family.
I didn't even have time for myself.

35:54.057 --> 35:55.889
I think you make the time.

35:55.890 --> 35:58.097
Okay well, I can't
just go up to my boss

35:58.098 --> 36:01.847
and say, "Hey, sorry, but I'm
gonna leave early every day

36:01.848 --> 36:04.055
"without finishing my work
so that I can go hang out

36:04.056 --> 36:05.680
"with my kids and my wife."

36:05.681 --> 36:06.847
It doesn't work that way.

36:06.848 --> 36:08.680
No, people make things
work all the time,

36:08.681 --> 36:11.807
despite the odds,
including marriage.

36:13.224 --> 36:16.931
And is this how
we overcome those odds?

36:18.182 --> 36:23.389
With self-help regimens such as,
Whitney Walsh's bridal boot camp?

36:23.390 --> 36:27.181
This has gotta be
one of the most ridiculous...

36:27.182 --> 36:30.057
- Please tell me you aren't doing this.
- Of course not!

36:31.430 --> 36:35.223
No, that's just for our
guests, someone left it here.

36:36.389 --> 36:38.682
Hey, I think I have
some cake in the back.

36:38.683 --> 36:40.139
How about dessert?

36:40.140 --> 36:42.307
- How about yeah.
- Okay.

36:47.098 --> 36:49.013
So, if went to try this one...

36:49.014 --> 36:50.222
Guys!

36:50.223 --> 36:53.013
Did you see the article June
posted on her blog this morning?

36:53.014 --> 36:56.013
She totally trashed the boot camp,

36:56.014 --> 37:00.181
calling it a "unbridled exercise
in puritanical nonsense."

37:02.348 --> 37:05.264
Well who knows, maybe she's right.
I know I'm getting sick of it.

37:05.265 --> 37:09.263
I don't know you guys,
maybe Whitney is right.

37:09.264 --> 37:11.555
I'm just saying, who knows,
we might actually learn

37:11.556 --> 37:13.846
something if we allow ourselves.

37:13.847 --> 37:16.013
Well, admittedly, I was
actually thinking of quitting

37:16.014 --> 37:18.389
earlier this week but, you guys,

37:18.390 --> 37:21.055
I feel more in shape than
I have in a long time.

37:21.056 --> 37:23.138
Yoga's my new calling.

37:23.139 --> 37:26.597
See, rule number two.
Look good, you feel good.

37:26.598 --> 37:30.139
Yeah, and I saw that pilot last night.
He brought me a latte.

37:30.140 --> 37:32.554
But, when I saw
the wings on his hat,

37:32.555 --> 37:35.389
it totally reminded me
of my sweet Rick.

37:35.390 --> 37:38.180
That's progress,
rule number three, right?

37:38.181 --> 37:39.763
Settle down.

37:39.764 --> 37:42.430
See, I don't think we should
listen to that columnist.

37:42.431 --> 37:46.222
I bet she's just upset that Whitney
didn't like her wardrobe choices.

37:46.223 --> 37:48.930
Yeah, I just don't
know if I can do it guys.

37:48.931 --> 37:51.430
That cake just looks so good.

37:51.431 --> 37:54.763
I swear, I am like two seconds
away from face planting it!

37:54.764 --> 37:56.263
Wendy!

37:56.264 --> 37:58.055
What did Whitney say your
cravings were stemming from?

37:58.056 --> 38:02.138
From the minds of the evil
cellulite on my behind.

38:02.139 --> 38:05.431
- Exactly, and rule number five is...
- Be strong.

38:06.598 --> 38:11.055
God, come on Day, get it together.
You are so much better than that.

38:11.056 --> 38:14.180
Come on you guys, seriously,
if we can't do this for one week,

38:14.181 --> 38:17.764
how do we expect our
marriages to last a lifetime?

38:17.765 --> 38:20.514
Exactly, well put Andy.

38:20.515 --> 38:24.346
Our wish for you,
one love to last a lifetime.

38:24.347 --> 38:27.389
That's the motto at
Bonnie's Bridal, right?

38:27.390 --> 38:30.846
I read it on your website.
Such a cute little philosophy.

38:30.847 --> 38:32.930
I might have to steal it
for my boot camp.

38:32.931 --> 38:37.305
Now then ladies, this is the
famous wedding planner, Julian.

38:37.306 --> 38:39.681
He's going to help us
maximize our wedding's

38:39.682 --> 38:42.681
production value, while
minimizing those budgets.

38:43.846 --> 38:46.221
Listen ladies, listen.

38:46.222 --> 38:47.805
Take notes.

38:47.806 --> 38:51.347
This is the simplest way to keep
your Louis Vuitton's loaded.

38:51.348 --> 38:53.013
Prioritize.

38:53.014 --> 38:57.972
You place the most important individuals,
such as immediate family and friends,

38:57.973 --> 39:03.179
nearest the bride and groom's table,
while placing any degenerate cousins

39:03.180 --> 39:07.348
and that one gassy grandpa,
down here, furthest from you.

39:08.722 --> 39:10.597
And as for all childhood
friends who didn't like you

39:10.598 --> 39:13.847
back at school but are now
stalking you on social media,

39:13.848 --> 39:16.638
all of those individuals you
feel obligated to invite,

39:16.639 --> 39:19.014
but don't know how you'll
afford to have them,

39:19.973 --> 39:21.554
There.

39:21.555 --> 39:24.055
Ten grand on an evening of
artificial smiles, saved.

39:24.056 --> 39:28.889
Now, we'll move on to maximizing
the production value of your wedding with...

39:31.181 --> 39:36.013
A great lighting scheme and
choreographed dance numbers.

39:43.390 --> 39:46.847
You're still up.
What are you doing?

39:46.848 --> 39:49.430
Not much, just trying to
minimize our wedding budget.

39:49.431 --> 39:51.721
- Nice.
- Wanna help me?

39:51.722 --> 39:55.888
Baby, I'm sorry,
I'm so exhausted.

39:55.889 --> 39:58.596
I just promised my boss that
I'd play a round of golf

39:58.597 --> 40:01.596
with him before class
tomorrow morning.

40:01.597 --> 40:04.138
You're going golfing?

40:04.139 --> 40:06.222
Is that more important
than our wedding?

40:06.223 --> 40:08.138
No, it's not more
important than our wedding,

40:08.139 --> 40:10.096
but it is my job, and
it's important right?

40:10.097 --> 40:12.680
Why are you worried about the
whole budget thing, anyways?

40:12.681 --> 40:15.429
I mean, you can have
anything you want.

40:15.430 --> 40:19.389
- My mom said they'd cover it.
- It's not that, I just thought,

40:19.390 --> 40:22.930
maybe there were some people who
didn't need to be invited after all.

40:22.931 --> 40:24.764
In that case...

40:25.972 --> 40:30.097
Yes, my Aunt Linda,
yeah, she's a crazy one.

40:30.098 --> 40:31.930
We can actually get
rid of her if you want,

40:31.931 --> 40:34.764
'cause if you don't,
that bar is doomed, I tell ya.

40:35.889 --> 40:37.388
That woman can drink.

40:37.389 --> 40:38.639
You remember that time I
took you to meet my parents

40:38.640 --> 40:40.888
for the first time, and
Aunt Linda was there,

40:40.889 --> 40:42.264
you thought she was my grandma?

40:43.931 --> 40:45.304
My grandma looks younger
than she does.

40:45.305 --> 40:48.096
- I mean, that woman has lived.
- Yeah.

40:48.097 --> 40:50.805
- Seems like ages ago.
- Yeah.

40:50.806 --> 40:53.805
- Hard to believe it's been, a year?
- Yeah.

40:53.806 --> 40:55.805
I cannot wait to
have time like that again.

40:55.806 --> 40:58.222
Last summer was so fun.

40:58.223 --> 41:02.304
Well I mean, I don't know
if we'll have time like that again.

41:02.305 --> 41:04.555
Once my residency starts,
it's gonna get worse

41:04.556 --> 41:06.055
before it gets better.

41:06.056 --> 41:10.471
But hey, at least we'll have
really nice vacations.

41:10.472 --> 41:13.596
But, don't you think
once we have kids,

41:13.597 --> 41:17.346
you'll be able to
get off early and...

41:17.347 --> 41:19.055
Yeah, sure, I suppose.

41:19.056 --> 41:22.471
I mean, maybe I can make
something work like that,

41:22.472 --> 41:25.972
but, look, they're gonna
have you anyway, okay.

41:25.973 --> 41:28.137
I'm sure you'll be
taking good care of them

41:28.138 --> 41:31.555
until I get home, alright, you
can tell them bedtime stories

41:31.556 --> 41:36.680
and make 'em BLT's and be all cutesy,
and do all the mom stuff.

41:36.681 --> 41:39.514
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

41:52.388 --> 41:55.346
You must be Rob,
the history teacher.

41:55.347 --> 41:58.054
Wendy tells me you're a
little anxious about today.

41:58.055 --> 41:59.888
Wendy knows I can't dance.

41:59.889 --> 42:04.347
There's no can't in
bridal boot camp, Rob.

42:04.348 --> 42:09.596
Rick, the comic book writer.
Your kids are going to love you.

42:09.597 --> 42:11.097
And I can dance.

42:14.847 --> 42:16.720
Patrick the police officer.

42:16.721 --> 42:18.554
Hate to be a criminal
on the run from you.

42:18.555 --> 42:22.472
Freeze, LAPD!
See what I did...

42:24.515 --> 42:25.515
Cute.

42:28.055 --> 42:31.805
And you must be Troy,
the big pro football player.

42:31.806 --> 42:34.888
Yes ma'am, first string,
six years and countin'.

42:34.889 --> 42:37.221
So glad you're here.

42:37.222 --> 42:40.763
You're such a gentleman,
and it's so nice to see Felice smiling.

42:40.764 --> 42:42.721
She's usually so grumpy.

42:46.098 --> 42:49.388
- Where's Jordan?
- He can't make it.

42:49.389 --> 42:51.930
He tried to get off
work but, he couldn't.

42:51.931 --> 42:54.137
Well then who's gonna
be your dance partner?

42:54.138 --> 42:58.512
Well, when it's her turn,
she can just dance with Troy too.

42:58.513 --> 42:59.847
Or I'll do it.

43:03.138 --> 43:07.262
Everyone, this is Casey Connor,
who does his very own

43:07.263 --> 43:09.595
special wedding arrangements,
so if you don't

43:09.596 --> 43:13.596
have your flower arrangements booked
yet, Connor's is the way to go.

43:13.597 --> 43:16.137
And we offer a 10%
discount for first timers.

43:16.138 --> 43:18.930
- Those are beautiful, I want those!
- Okay.

43:25.097 --> 43:29.096
You didn't tell me you were Casey
Connor, the owner of the florist.

43:29.097 --> 43:31.055
And you told me that
this was just some brochure

43:31.056 --> 43:33.304
for your guests,
which I took, by the way,

43:33.305 --> 43:36.304
and decided to call so that
I could try and promote me.

43:36.305 --> 43:39.887
Fine, yeah, I signed
up for the camp but,

43:39.888 --> 43:43.054
for the record, my
girlfriend dragged me here.

43:43.055 --> 43:48.262
Though, Andrea is just loving
bridal boot camp, aren't we dear?

43:48.263 --> 43:52.680
And she's practically a natural
at abiding by our boot camp rule book.

43:52.681 --> 43:54.221
Oh is she?

43:54.222 --> 43:56.305
And wait, how do you two
know each other, exactly?

43:56.306 --> 43:57.722
Connor's delivers
to the boutique.

43:58.639 --> 44:01.304
- And we had pizza.
- Pizza?

44:01.305 --> 44:05.221
You don't eat pizza. Only thing
you spring for are spring rolls.

44:05.222 --> 44:07.553
Why are you judging me?
I had barely eaten all day.

44:07.554 --> 44:10.596
- And she ate it all.
- Excuse us, she was talking to me.

44:10.597 --> 44:11.597
Sorry.

44:14.180 --> 44:18.222
Everyone, I'd like to
introduce you to Antonio.

44:18.223 --> 44:20.137
He's our dance instructor.

44:20.138 --> 44:23.180
He will be teaching us
a wonderful routine.

44:23.181 --> 44:24.845
Good afternoon, ladies.

44:24.846 --> 44:26.597
Shall we start the music?

45:07.721 --> 45:09.973
Who would like to go first?

45:18.263 --> 45:22.054
- Your hands are really warm.
- Abnormally warm?

45:22.055 --> 45:24.388
No, it's just, my fiancee,
Jordan's hands,

45:24.389 --> 45:28.178
are always cold so, it gets
chilly holding his hand.

45:28.179 --> 45:31.053
Kinda like getting one of
those ice cream brain freezes?

45:31.054 --> 45:33.470
Yeah.

45:33.471 --> 45:36.720
Sounds like you need a good pair
of winter gloves to help you acclimate.

45:36.721 --> 45:37.888
Maybe so.

45:38.764 --> 45:42.012
I'm so sorry!
We were doing so well.

45:42.013 --> 45:44.595
I didn't sign up to get
my big toe broken, you know.

45:44.596 --> 45:46.597
- Excuse me.
- Excuse me.

45:51.304 --> 45:54.304
Now that is what you need to pull off
on your big wedding day.

45:54.305 --> 45:56.304
Yeah, I have no idea
what we just did.

46:02.763 --> 46:06.761
Thank you for, staying
to be my partner.

46:06.762 --> 46:10.971
- That was nice.
- That's what a good friend does.

46:10.972 --> 46:13.136
So we're good friends now?

46:13.137 --> 46:15.553
Well if you wanna take advantage
of my friends and family

46:15.554 --> 46:18.346
20% discount on
wedding arrangements,

46:18.347 --> 46:20.887
you should at least
think about it.

46:20.888 --> 46:22.639
Okay, good friends.

46:29.638 --> 46:32.303
Thank you so much for
coming today, gentleman.

46:32.304 --> 46:35.095
You were such troopers,
and always remember...

46:35.096 --> 46:39.137
Be good to your brides for she holds
the keys to your heart.

46:39.138 --> 46:40.388
Exactly, bye!

46:43.514 --> 46:45.429
Alright boys, see ya.

46:54.805 --> 46:57.971
This was such a great experience
for my technique, Antonio.

46:57.972 --> 47:00.261
I feel like I learned
so much from your moves.

47:00.262 --> 47:02.679
Thank you, I am so
glad that you enjoyed it.

47:02.680 --> 47:06.514
I truly did, thank you so much.
Your work is just amazing.

47:07.347 --> 47:11.638
- Okay, thank you.
- What, he's hot.

47:13.805 --> 47:19.803
- Do you ladies have any plans tonight?
- I'm usually too sore to do anything.

47:19.804 --> 47:23.471
Well, if you're too
tired, I totally understand,

47:23.472 --> 47:27.011
but it's my bachelorette party tonight,
and I don't have that many friends,

47:27.012 --> 47:31.346
so, if you ladies wanna join me,
it would be so awesome!

47:31.347 --> 47:33.513
It's at Ramone's pub at 7:30.

47:33.514 --> 47:34.804
Are there gonna be
male dancers there?

47:34.805 --> 47:36.595
'Cause if not, I can ask Antonio,
it would just...

47:36.596 --> 47:38.844
No, Lorelei, you can't.

47:38.845 --> 47:40.721
I hope you guys can make it,

47:40.722 --> 47:43.388
especially since tomorrow is
our last day of boot camp.

47:43.389 --> 47:45.261
I'm gonna miss you guys so much.

47:45.262 --> 47:48.845
Me too.
I'm in.

47:48.846 --> 47:51.012
I'm in too, and we all
need just one last hurrah

47:51.013 --> 47:53.220
before bridal boot
camp comes to an end.

47:53.221 --> 47:55.470
Well, I guess I could use a drink.

47:55.471 --> 47:58.553
Felice, I thought we were
gonna go pick up your dress?

47:58.554 --> 48:01.554
It's fine, you can just bring it
with you tomorrow when you come.

48:03.930 --> 48:05.887
Okay girls, so,

48:05.888 --> 48:08.471
tomorrow's the last day
of bridal boot camp,

48:08.472 --> 48:10.387
and we're gonna be
talking about nuptials,

48:10.388 --> 48:11.887
so get a lot of rest.

48:15.221 --> 48:16.221
Party!

48:21.097 --> 48:23.095
Felice, do you really
think it's a good idea

48:23.096 --> 48:24.887
to go out partying
the night before

48:24.888 --> 48:26.595
our last day of boot camp?

48:26.596 --> 48:28.679
Whitney will throw a
fit if she finds out

48:28.680 --> 48:30.513
we were all out
breaking the rules.

48:30.514 --> 48:33.971
Come on, she can't
control our lives forever.

48:33.972 --> 48:35.595
And since when did you become
such a stick in the mud

48:35.596 --> 48:37.136
in the first place?

48:37.137 --> 48:40.053
- You used to be so much fun.
- Hey, I'm still fun.

48:40.054 --> 48:43.304
I'm just trying to stick to the rules
we committed to, remember?

48:43.305 --> 48:47.179
Well in that case, why don't you take
a look at rule number four again.

48:47.180 --> 48:50.470
- Be interested.
- Good, I'm glad we agree.

48:54.221 --> 48:56.428
- Hey!
- You made it!

48:56.429 --> 48:57.804
We did.

48:57.805 --> 49:01.680
- Thank you.
- So, who wants to get crazy?

49:03.138 --> 49:06.804
Let's go, yeah.

49:08.554 --> 49:13.595
Geez, I am just so obsessed
with these arrangements, aren't you?

49:13.596 --> 49:16.971
And I think the man who made them
is obsessed with this one.

49:16.972 --> 49:18.971
Yeah.

49:18.972 --> 49:21.012
Really?
I thought he was gay.

49:22.471 --> 49:24.136
I even invited him to
come out tonight with us.

49:24.137 --> 49:27.387
Wait, but, he does
flower arrangements.

49:27.388 --> 49:32.511
- No, I know he's straight.
- I saw the way he was looking at you.

49:32.512 --> 49:35.303
Kinda like the
way Wendy's been staring

49:35.304 --> 49:38.136
at those zucchinis
before she inhales them.

49:38.137 --> 49:39.345
Hey!

49:39.346 --> 49:41.136
You, girl, are one to talk,
because you almost

49:41.137 --> 49:43.303
fell off the wagon with
mister dancy pants.

49:43.304 --> 49:46.637
Whatever, Rick knows
I'm not going anywhere.

49:46.638 --> 49:48.804
We're getting
married in six weeks.

49:48.805 --> 49:51.387
And I'm happier now
than I've been in,

49:51.388 --> 49:53.513
like since the day
we fell in love.

49:53.514 --> 49:55.012
Do you still remember it?

49:55.013 --> 49:56.388
I mean, the day you
fell in love with him.

49:56.389 --> 49:58.470
What?
Of course I do.

49:58.471 --> 50:00.345
Story time, do share please,
do share.

50:00.346 --> 50:02.845
Well, I'd been seeing
him around a while,

50:02.846 --> 50:04.969
'cause he's friends with
my best friend's boyfriend

50:04.970 --> 50:09.512
and one night, he was walking me
home after we'd all been out.

50:09.513 --> 50:11.427
He knew that the pilot
always brought me coffee

50:11.428 --> 50:13.511
to work every once in a while,

50:13.512 --> 50:16.011
so he pulled me into this
late night coffee shop

50:16.012 --> 50:19.594
and bought me one bag of
every kind of coffee bean,

50:19.595 --> 50:22.261
and when I asked him why, he said,

50:22.262 --> 50:24.844
"Because you deserve it all the time,

50:24.845 --> 50:28.678
"and not just once in a while
when you need a fix."

50:28.679 --> 50:31.513
And then, he kissed me like, good.

50:32.845 --> 50:36.053
That's so sweet.
Right?

50:36.054 --> 50:37.553
What about you, what
about you and the cop?

50:37.554 --> 50:39.303
Wendy please,
your turn, go, share.

50:39.304 --> 50:44.135
Okay, so, we'd been
working together for a while,

50:44.136 --> 50:47.011
and I had my eye on him but,

50:47.012 --> 50:49.054
I didn't think he ever
noticed me, you know,

50:49.055 --> 50:51.178
because he was so shy.

50:51.179 --> 50:53.679
My kids found out, because
I guess I talked about him

50:53.680 --> 50:56.470
all the time, I don't
know, and they told him

50:56.471 --> 50:59.595
that I had a crush on him.

50:59.596 --> 51:02.679
So one day, I walk
into my classroom,

51:02.680 --> 51:06.636
and my students, they
stand up one by one,

51:06.637 --> 51:10.553
and they hold up letters
that spelled out,

51:10.554 --> 51:12.553
Will you go out with me?

51:15.596 --> 51:19.761
I know, and then, he walked
in with this huge bouquet of flowers,

51:19.762 --> 51:22.761
and he asked me out himself.

51:22.762 --> 51:27.178
My, go Rob, I didn't think he had
it in him, he's always been so...

51:27.179 --> 51:28.427
Unromantic?

51:28.428 --> 51:30.136
Yes, normally
he is very unromantic,

51:30.137 --> 51:34.387
but, you know, that's
how I knew he meant it.

51:34.388 --> 51:36.511
Andy, what about you?

51:36.512 --> 51:38.553
I'm gonna run to the restroom.

51:38.554 --> 51:40.844
How about you go first,
I've heard this story.

51:40.845 --> 51:42.262
My turn.

51:56.971 --> 52:02.470
- Hey, what are you doing here?
- Bachelorette shenanigans.

52:03.471 --> 52:04.471
Seriously.

52:06.388 --> 52:09.387
Wendy said she wanted
to see my arrangements,

52:09.388 --> 52:11.804
and asked if I could
drop off my look book

52:11.805 --> 52:14.469
since her wedding's
around the corner.

52:14.470 --> 52:17.095
What about you?
Did you just get here?

52:17.096 --> 52:19.762
No, I'm just leaving, actually.

52:21.637 --> 52:27.094
- Well I can walk you to your car.
- Felice drove, so I'm just gonna...

52:27.095 --> 52:29.135
I'm just gonna grab a cab.

52:29.136 --> 52:30.136
What?

52:30.971 --> 52:33.680
No, no no no, I'll drop you off.

52:36.262 --> 52:39.179
Okay, fine, I'll wait right here.

52:46.804 --> 52:47.804
Seriously?

52:49.011 --> 52:51.053
You totally just
Irish goodbye'd me.

52:51.054 --> 52:53.178
No, I'm just, I'll be fine.

52:53.179 --> 52:55.595
Yeah, you may be fine now,

52:55.596 --> 52:59.179
but, what kind of guilt
would you leave me to carry,

52:59.180 --> 53:01.886
if something were to happen
to you on that taxi ride home?

53:01.887 --> 53:02.887
Like what?

53:04.512 --> 53:08.052
You could, sit in
a wet wad of gum,

53:08.053 --> 53:10.593
or get one of those
really annoying drivers

53:10.594 --> 53:14.345
who just talks about the
fungal growth on his big toe.

53:14.346 --> 53:15.636
Is that really something

53:15.637 --> 53:18.011
you want me carrying
on my conscience?

53:18.012 --> 53:21.513
Okay, okay, fine,
you can drive me home.

53:22.887 --> 53:25.511
I'll wait for you
right here, I promise.

53:25.512 --> 53:28.719
You think I trust you now?
I don't think so.

53:28.720 --> 53:30.386
I'm gonna let you take this
look book with you tomorrow.

53:30.387 --> 53:33.636
I'm not letting
you outta my sight.

53:33.637 --> 53:36.178
This way,
your chariot awaits you.

53:40.136 --> 53:42.387
These are really
impressive arrangements.

53:42.388 --> 53:45.094
And, you don't just
do flowers either.

53:45.095 --> 53:48.136
Nope, nope, any
kind of interior design,

53:48.137 --> 53:52.718
or exterior display horticulture,
anything that's green.

53:52.719 --> 53:55.177
So when you quit
that marketing job,

53:55.178 --> 53:57.303
what made you wanna do this?

53:57.304 --> 54:02.261
Well, I grew up in this
little town outside of Austin,

54:02.262 --> 54:03.970
and back home there was always

54:03.971 --> 54:06.511
this constant competition
amongst the neighbors

54:06.512 --> 54:09.427
to see who would win,
yard of the month.

54:09.428 --> 54:13.637
And my mom and dad were
absolutely hellbent

54:13.638 --> 54:17.885
on maintaining the crown,
so I was often forced

54:17.886 --> 54:23.053
into their after school landscaping
escapades, against my will, by the way.

54:23.054 --> 54:25.594
After I graduated and
went off to college,

54:25.595 --> 54:30.803
I despised the thought of it all but,
once I got into the business world,

54:30.804 --> 54:35.303
I really started to miss it,
the peacefulness of it.

54:35.304 --> 54:40.719
So, you were bred into it,
kinda like me and dress making.

54:40.720 --> 54:41.720
That's nice.

54:42.804 --> 54:45.302
I'd love to see
your shop sometime.

54:45.303 --> 54:47.137
How about right now?

54:49.470 --> 54:51.660
- Okay.
- Okay.

55:04.553 --> 55:08.886
- These are really beautiful.
- Thank you.

55:08.887 --> 55:10.137
Are you hungry?

55:11.387 --> 55:13.302
'Cause I can throw some burgers
on the grill

55:13.303 --> 55:14.970
while I show you
the garden out back.

55:14.971 --> 55:17.428
What, first pizza,
and now burgers?

55:17.429 --> 55:19.970
You're a terrible influence,
you know that?

55:19.971 --> 55:24.970
Okay, I can
make you a turkey burger.

55:24.971 --> 55:28.886
I was avoiding fried
food like the plague,

55:28.887 --> 55:31.345
but a burger does sound amazing.

55:31.346 --> 55:33.844
It does, after you.

55:43.345 --> 55:45.345
You did all this?

55:46.303 --> 55:47.303
Yep.

55:49.095 --> 55:52.551
I can show you my little greenhouse
after we eat, if you like.

55:52.552 --> 55:55.470
That's where all the good stuff is.

56:06.345 --> 56:07.969
Where to next, ladies?

56:07.970 --> 56:10.386
Seriously?
You wanna keep going?

56:10.387 --> 56:11.927
Dude, none of us are
gonna be able to drive.

56:11.928 --> 56:15.719
Just don't even, just park the car,
don't even get in them, let's cab it.

56:15.720 --> 56:17.219
The night's young, ladies.

56:18.720 --> 56:21.095
Let's go to the Rainbow Bar
on Fourth!

56:21.096 --> 56:22.803
There's plenty of
non-threatening men there,

56:22.804 --> 56:26.010
who really know
how to turn it up.

56:26.011 --> 56:29.095
Yes!
Onward ho's!

56:30.594 --> 56:35.054
- Yes, hold on, hold on.
- Wait for us!

56:40.679 --> 56:43.843
You were very
generous on the mayo.

56:43.844 --> 56:46.760
So what?
I love mayo.

56:46.761 --> 56:48.928
Me too, me too.

56:48.929 --> 56:51.845
So my dad makes
the best burgers,

56:52.970 --> 56:55.177
but I think you gave
him a run for his money.

56:55.178 --> 56:59.052
Well thank you.
Are your parents still together?

56:59.053 --> 57:03.010
Yeah, they have like,
the perfect marriage.

57:03.011 --> 57:05.011
I honestly don't think
that either of them

57:05.012 --> 57:08.636
has even looked at another
person since they met.

57:08.637 --> 57:10.844
They are so madly in love.

57:10.845 --> 57:13.928
They go on dates,
vacations, they even flirt,

57:13.929 --> 57:16.470
which is, kinda disgusting.

57:17.761 --> 57:18.929
But, cute.

57:21.178 --> 57:25.137
Yeah, I I think my folks
must still be pretty in love,

57:26.970 --> 57:30.678
although they do bicker
quite a bit these days.

57:30.679 --> 57:33.346
Though my mom likes to
call it love quarreling.

57:36.012 --> 57:40.636
You know, sometimes I think
they kinda ruined it for me,

57:40.637 --> 57:43.886
set the bar too high,
and that's why I have

57:43.887 --> 57:45.928
such a hard time finding a girl

57:45.929 --> 57:48.969
that I would actually
consider marrying.

57:48.970 --> 57:52.803
Come on, no, there are
so many good girls out there.

57:52.804 --> 57:55.678
Trust me, if even I could
find a guy great enough

57:55.679 --> 57:59.260
to give my parents a run
for their money then,

57:59.261 --> 58:00.845
you can find yours.

58:03.844 --> 58:07.635
So when is the big day, anyhow?

58:07.636 --> 58:09.679
It is June 29th.

58:11.678 --> 58:15.843
- Nice, everything coming together?
- I think so.

58:15.844 --> 58:19.511
I'm a bit of a planner, so
I definitely got ahead of myself.

58:19.512 --> 58:24.094
All I have to do is finish my dress,
and order my cake.

58:24.095 --> 58:29.678
- Yeah, yeah, the caramely one.
- Dolce de leche, yep.

58:31.387 --> 58:32.843
Good for you.

58:32.844 --> 58:37.344
You know, it's too bad your
fiancee couldn't make it today.

58:37.345 --> 58:41.218
He really missed out.
Camp was actually, kinda fun.

58:41.219 --> 58:45.387
Between you and me, I didn't
tell my fiancee about today.

58:46.970 --> 58:50.052
He doesn't even know
that I'm doing this camp.

58:50.053 --> 58:51.054
Seriously?

58:52.178 --> 58:55.635
Why not, why didn't
you tell him?

58:55.636 --> 58:59.718
Well I, I just thought if
even I think it's kinda silly,

58:59.719 --> 59:03.718
and so does my mom and so
do you, why wouldn't he?

59:03.719 --> 59:05.677
Well if you thought it
was gonna be so silly,

59:05.678 --> 59:08.386
why would you do it
in the first place?

59:08.387 --> 59:11.927
Well I realized there's
still a lotta things

59:11.928 --> 59:15.386
I don't know about him, even
though it's been over a year.

59:15.387 --> 59:20.052
I do wanna be the best
bride I can for him, for us.

59:20.053 --> 59:25.510
Well, I imagine it takes a lifetime
to truly get to know someone,

59:25.511 --> 59:27.885
so even if you guys are
together 50 years from now,

59:27.886 --> 59:30.926
you're still not gonna
100% know each other.

59:30.927 --> 59:32.511
But that's gotta be one
of the nicest things

59:32.512 --> 59:34.802
about a healthy
relationship, you know?

59:34.803 --> 59:37.219
Finding out all those
new things as they,

59:37.220 --> 59:42.051
and you, change, and then
learning to grow with them,

59:42.052 --> 59:44.218
and then still choosing
to be with that person

59:44.219 --> 59:46.759
despite all those changes.

59:46.760 --> 59:50.218
Do you really think that
people change that much?

59:50.219 --> 59:52.052
I think we're
changing every day.

59:52.053 --> 59:55.218
- No.
- No?

59:55.219 --> 59:59.301
Not me, I know I have
always been exactly the same.

59:59.302 --> 01:00:01.719
Are you so sure about that?

01:00:03.427 --> 01:00:06.343
Anyway, I still think
you should've asked

01:00:06.344 --> 01:00:09.009
your fiancee to come today.

01:00:09.010 --> 01:00:12.301
I mean, you haven't even given
him the chance to say no.

01:00:12.302 --> 01:00:16.344
Well, he had class, and I knew
he couldn't get off for that.

01:00:16.345 --> 01:00:21.969
But how is he ever gonna step up
to the plate if you won't ask him to?

01:00:21.970 --> 01:00:25.219
Okay, I guess you make a point.

01:00:25.220 --> 01:00:26.220
See there?

01:00:27.636 --> 01:00:31.260
Just now there, your opinion
about something changed.

01:00:36.636 --> 01:00:39.301
Did you like
my little greenhouse?

01:00:39.302 --> 01:00:43.427
Mr. Connors, your horticulture skills
are impressive,

01:00:44.470 --> 01:00:47.178
but, I should probably
go home now.

01:00:48.677 --> 01:00:51.678
Or, you could take a little break.

01:00:54.386 --> 01:00:57.678
Come here, I wanna
show you something.

01:00:57.679 --> 01:01:01.884
- What, what are you doing?
- Come, come, come down here.

01:01:01.885 --> 01:01:04.842
It seems as though you have
a lot on your mind.

01:01:04.843 --> 01:01:07.218
When I have a lot on my mind,

01:01:07.219 --> 01:01:10.219
this is where
I come to sort it out.

01:01:13.594 --> 01:01:15.511
So what do I do next?

01:01:18.094 --> 01:01:20.387
That's for you to decide.

01:01:51.510 --> 01:01:55.218
- Coffee?
- Wait, what, it's morning?

01:01:55.219 --> 01:01:58.718
Yes, it's okay,
I fell asleep here too.

01:01:58.719 --> 01:02:00.802
I woke up and you just,
looked too peaceful

01:02:00.803 --> 01:02:02.759
to way up so soon,
I figured you needed it.

01:02:02.760 --> 01:02:03.760
What...

01:02:06.010 --> 01:02:07.718
I'm gonna be late
for my last day of boot camp.

01:02:07.719 --> 01:02:09.218
Okay, okay, no probs,
I'll take ya home,

01:02:09.219 --> 01:02:11.552
I'll take ya home, let's go.

01:02:25.386 --> 01:02:26.386
Shame.

01:02:30.678 --> 01:02:32.926
I'm here, I'm here.

01:02:32.927 --> 01:02:36.926
- Sorry I'm late.
- Nice of you to join us.

01:02:36.927 --> 01:02:40.426
You ladies look like you
need hair of the dog,

01:02:40.427 --> 01:02:41.968
downward dog.

01:02:41.969 --> 01:02:46.635
Come on ladies, let's do
this bridal boot camp!

01:02:46.636 --> 01:02:47.636
I'm sorry.

01:02:49.427 --> 01:02:53.259
I know you all must be
in a lot of pain.

01:02:53.260 --> 01:02:56.095
That's not really
my fault, is it?

01:02:57.969 --> 01:03:00.551
You all failed, hard.

01:03:00.552 --> 01:03:02.802
Why didn't you call me
back last night?

01:03:02.803 --> 01:03:04.385
Sorry, fell asleep.

01:03:04.386 --> 01:03:07.134
I can't believe you just left like that,
without saying goodbye.

01:03:07.135 --> 01:03:10.135
I texted you, not to mention
I didn't wanna be there.

01:03:10.136 --> 01:03:12.218
Ladies, I can hear you.

01:03:15.302 --> 01:03:17.593
Okay, you can all relax, ladies.

01:03:19.219 --> 01:03:20.219
Namaste.

01:03:21.843 --> 01:03:24.969
Now, I know the original plan
was to talk nuptials today,

01:03:24.970 --> 01:03:27.468
but, instead I think we
should skip all that,

01:03:27.469 --> 01:03:32.134
- and write vows to ourselves.
- Vows to ourselves?

01:03:32.135 --> 01:03:35.427
Yeah, yes, a vow
is a solemn promise,

01:03:36.802 --> 01:03:39.260
and you have to write them
for yourself

01:03:39.261 --> 01:03:41.551
before you can write them
to your husband.

01:03:41.552 --> 01:03:43.509
Vows to ourselves?

01:03:43.510 --> 01:03:47.553
You have got to be kidding us
right now, Whitney.

01:03:51.052 --> 01:03:54.300
Are you questioning
my methods, dear?

01:03:54.301 --> 01:03:55.302
Yes, I am.

01:03:56.468 --> 01:03:58.218
I don't need to write
some dumb vow to myself

01:03:58.219 --> 01:04:02.509
in order to be a good wife
to my husband, thank you.

01:04:02.510 --> 01:04:05.051
Tell me Felice,
when you singed up

01:04:05.052 --> 01:04:07.010
for this bridal boot
camp, did you think

01:04:07.011 --> 01:04:09.926
it was just gonna be leafing
through wedding catalogs,

01:04:09.927 --> 01:04:12.176
drinking bottomless mimosas,

01:04:12.177 --> 01:04:16.009
and eating chocolate
covered strawberries?

01:04:16.010 --> 01:04:17.344
Actually, yes.

01:04:21.344 --> 01:04:23.884
You clearly signed up
for this camp

01:04:23.885 --> 01:04:26.550
because you felt
like you needed my help.

01:04:26.551 --> 01:04:29.926
How can I help you,
if you won't let me?

01:04:29.927 --> 01:04:33.093
Well, I suppose I thank you,
for showing me

01:04:33.094 --> 01:04:37.093
that I, in fact,
no longer need your help.

01:04:37.094 --> 01:04:38.094
I quit.

01:04:46.385 --> 01:04:48.010
Felice, what are you doing?

01:04:48.011 --> 01:04:51.801
It's our last day of camp,
you can't just take off like this.

01:04:51.802 --> 01:04:55.885
Making vows to ourselves about
the kind of people we think we are?

01:04:55.886 --> 01:04:59.677
Don't you see, Andy?
This boot camp isn't helping us,

01:04:59.678 --> 01:05:02.094
it's only turning us into
a bunch of Stepford wives,

01:05:02.095 --> 01:05:05.676
making us more insecure about
our flaws than we already are.

01:05:05.677 --> 01:05:07.218
What are you talking about?

01:05:07.219 --> 01:05:09.759
Sharon lost weight, Wendy
got her husband to dance,

01:05:09.760 --> 01:05:12.968
Lorelei got over the pilot,
it's helped everyone.

01:05:12.969 --> 01:05:15.176
Yet somehow, they were
all dying for a moment

01:05:15.177 --> 01:05:17.134
of innocent fun last night,

01:05:17.135 --> 01:05:20.426
only to come here and what,
be punished?

01:05:20.427 --> 01:05:22.801
I realized something last night,
when I got home,

01:05:22.802 --> 01:05:24.717
and Troy was laughing
at my broken heels

01:05:24.718 --> 01:05:27.759
and my frizz
all the way out to here.

01:05:27.760 --> 01:05:30.758
Troy loves me for me,
frizz and all.

01:05:30.759 --> 01:05:32.760
It's not the men that we need
to worry about, Andy,

01:05:32.761 --> 01:05:35.635
it's us, and if we want
our marriages to stay alive,

01:05:35.636 --> 01:05:39.134
we need to learn to listen,
and to love ourselves.

01:05:39.135 --> 01:05:42.759
And if our husbands love us,
then they will no matter what.

01:05:42.760 --> 01:05:46.968
Come on, Jordan's work
schedule has been so crazy,

01:05:46.969 --> 01:05:49.135
but do you see me giving up?

01:05:49.136 --> 01:05:52.842
If you can't last one week
of Whitney's silly little challenge,

01:05:52.843 --> 01:05:55.842
how do you expect to put in the work
to make your marriage last?

01:05:55.843 --> 01:05:57.884
Come on, Andy,
you're one to talk,

01:05:57.885 --> 01:05:59.677
you're so deluded about
your relationship,

01:05:59.678 --> 01:06:01.467
you can't even see
when you're off flirting

01:06:01.468 --> 01:06:03.676
with another guy
you barely even know.

01:06:03.677 --> 01:06:06.134
What?
I wasn't flirting with him!

01:06:06.135 --> 01:06:08.467
That's right, because
you're the perfect bride.

01:06:08.468 --> 01:06:10.051
Yeah, just like perfect Whitney,

01:06:10.052 --> 01:06:11.842
and her perfect marriage
to the perfect man

01:06:11.843 --> 01:06:13.759
that none of us
have ever even seen.

01:06:13.760 --> 01:06:16.176
So what, he's probably
working all day.

01:06:16.177 --> 01:06:21.634
Just like Jordan, and, I bet that's
why she's just as lonely as you are.

01:06:21.635 --> 01:06:26.133
You're just jealous that for once,
the attention is on me, and not on you.

01:06:26.134 --> 01:06:29.717
Yeah, that's right,
that must be it, Andy.

01:06:29.718 --> 01:06:31.925
You know if it makes you
feel better,

01:06:31.926 --> 01:06:35.384
then keep telling yourself that.

01:06:35.385 --> 01:06:36.677
Felice, wait.

01:06:38.385 --> 01:06:42.510
Here's your dress, and
if you need any alterations,

01:06:43.677 --> 01:06:45.509
you're gonna have to use
someone else,

01:06:45.510 --> 01:06:47.593
'cause I need to work
on my dress.

01:06:47.594 --> 01:06:50.176
Isn't that what you said?
I should be more selfish?

01:06:50.177 --> 01:06:51.301
Okay, I will.

01:06:54.010 --> 01:06:57.510
Andy, this is really beautiful.

01:06:57.511 --> 01:07:02.008
Only thing is, it's not you, or me,
for that matter.

01:07:02.009 --> 01:07:03.176
But thank you.

01:07:05.009 --> 01:07:07.010
Fine, get a new dress,

01:07:08.885 --> 01:07:12.510
get a new maid of honor
while you're at it.

01:07:24.718 --> 01:07:27.009
Thanks for coming back.

01:07:27.010 --> 01:07:30.009
- Thought we lost you too.
- Nope, still here.

01:07:30.010 --> 01:07:31.510
Pen and paper please?

01:07:55.009 --> 01:07:58.258
By the way, someone
stopped by to see you.

01:07:58.259 --> 01:07:59.427
Make it quick.

01:08:04.259 --> 01:08:06.133
What are you doing here?

01:08:06.134 --> 01:08:09.425
I just, came to drop off
the look book for you guys.

01:08:09.426 --> 01:08:11.258
I forgot to give it
to you this morning.

01:08:11.259 --> 01:08:14.884
- Is that really why you're here?
- Yes.

01:08:14.885 --> 01:08:18.093
Casey, I'm engaged, remember?

01:08:18.094 --> 01:08:21.841
I already knew that,
but thanks for the reminder.

01:08:21.843 --> 01:08:25.759
Okay, will you just stop with
the cutesy boy-next-door charm,

01:08:25.760 --> 01:08:28.884
and just admit that
you have feelings for me,

01:08:28.885 --> 01:08:32.051
and that's why you keep
coming around.

01:08:35.218 --> 01:08:38.969
Okay, fine, yes I do
have feelings for you.

01:08:40.301 --> 01:08:45.258
But I never really had
expectations about anything.

01:08:45.259 --> 01:08:48.133
I guess I just felt
this intuition that,

01:08:48.134 --> 01:08:52.175
maybe you needed company, and
since I like being around you,

01:08:52.176 --> 01:08:53.925
I just went with it, that's all.

01:08:53.926 --> 01:08:58.133
And it never crossed your
mind to pursue more with me?

01:08:58.134 --> 01:09:04.885
I mean, maybe in my wildest dreams,
but realistically, no, it didn't.

01:09:07.801 --> 01:09:13.801
- Did it cross yours?
- Absolutely not, I love my fiancee.

01:09:15.176 --> 01:09:18.718
Okay, okay great.
What's the problem?

01:09:19.885 --> 01:09:25.176
The problem is, I really don't think
we can be friends anymore.

01:09:25.176 --> 01:09:26.634
Why not?

01:09:26.635 --> 01:09:29.258
'Cause Casey, the world
doesn't work that way.

01:09:29.259 --> 01:09:31.550
Two people who are
attracted to each other

01:09:31.551 --> 01:09:35.341
cannot be friends, when
one of them is already engaged.

01:09:35.343 --> 01:09:38.133
Wait, so it has
crossed your mind

01:09:38.134 --> 01:09:40.384
that you might
like to be with me.

01:09:40.385 --> 01:09:42.341
That's not what I said.

01:09:42.343 --> 01:09:46.509
- It's kinda what you said.
- Well, it doesn't matter, okay?

01:09:46.510 --> 01:09:49.758
'Cause my relationship is great.

01:09:49.759 --> 01:09:54.342
My fiancee is kind and
wonderful, and honestly,

01:09:54.343 --> 01:09:56.967
I would never even
think about leaving him

01:09:56.968 --> 01:09:58.550
to be with someone like you.

01:09:58.551 --> 01:10:01.342
Someone like me?
What is that supposed to mean?

01:10:01.343 --> 01:10:03.968
Someone who doesn't
even believe in marriage,

01:10:03.969 --> 01:10:06.384
someone who can't commit
to anything.

01:10:06.385 --> 01:10:11.843
You're like a little kid living
in some magical garden fantasy world.

01:10:18.385 --> 01:10:19.426
Okay, fine.

01:10:20.677 --> 01:10:23.010
We don't have to be friends.

01:10:26.968 --> 01:10:29.134
You know Andy,
I want you to be happy,

01:10:29.135 --> 01:10:31.175
and I hope that you have
the perfect marriage,

01:10:31.176 --> 01:10:33.633
just like you said
your parents do,

01:10:33.634 --> 01:10:35.383
like how you said
you honestly didn't think

01:10:35.384 --> 01:10:39.258
that either of them had ever even
looked at anyone else since they met,

01:10:39.259 --> 01:10:42.550
all these years
still madly in love,

01:10:42.551 --> 01:10:44.508
but if your relationship
was really as amazing

01:10:44.509 --> 01:10:49.008
as you say it is, perhaps
you should ask yourself,

01:10:49.009 --> 01:10:51.260
why are you falling for me?

01:11:29.635 --> 01:11:32.468
- Mom.
- Oh, honey.

01:11:40.218 --> 01:11:44.424
Honey, if you wanna make it
work with Jordan,

01:11:44.425 --> 01:11:47.217
then maybe you should've
told him the truth.

01:11:47.218 --> 01:11:51.300
Your father and I, we don't keep
anything from each other.

01:11:51.301 --> 01:11:55.384
The most important thing
about marriage is honesty, and trust.

01:11:56.717 --> 01:11:58.467
Yeah, you're right.

01:12:02.343 --> 01:12:05.133
Have you talked to Felice yet?

01:12:05.134 --> 01:12:09.508
No, I don't think she'll wanna
talk to me again after what I said.

01:12:09.509 --> 01:12:12.342
Honey, she knows
that you don't mean this.

01:12:12.343 --> 01:12:13.925
You need to give her a call.

01:12:13.926 --> 01:12:16.425
I think I should
just give it some time.

01:12:16.426 --> 01:12:20.174
Andy, the wedding is in six weeks,
you don't have that much time.

01:12:20.175 --> 01:12:22.676
I know but, I just, I can't.

01:12:24.509 --> 01:12:29.174
I'm embarrassed, I lashed out
at her when I know she's right.

01:12:29.175 --> 01:12:32.717
Anyway, I'm sorry that
I came over so late.

01:12:33.927 --> 01:12:38.508
Are you kidding?
Our door is always open for you,

01:12:38.509 --> 01:12:40.341
and I love the fact that
you can come over here

01:12:40.342 --> 01:12:43.132
and we can still talk
about these things.

01:12:43.133 --> 01:12:46.509
But, you're right,
I do need to start

01:12:46.510 --> 01:12:49.883
depending on Jordan
for more support.

01:12:49.884 --> 01:12:52.758
You should, but know
that your father and I

01:12:52.759 --> 01:12:57.550
are always here for you,
even though he's asleep.

01:13:00.051 --> 01:13:01.051
Of course.

01:13:03.176 --> 01:13:05.051
- Mom.
- Yeah.

01:13:05.842 --> 01:13:11.883
Do you know the exact moment you
knew you had fallen in love with dad?

01:13:11.884 --> 01:13:13.133
I guess I do.

01:13:14.550 --> 01:13:18.217
We'd been dating two weeks,
two, I know that's crazy,

01:13:18.218 --> 01:13:20.257
but we were supposed to meet

01:13:20.258 --> 01:13:22.925
at this little grocery store
outside the campus.

01:13:22.926 --> 01:13:24.841
We were gonna get some stuff
and cook at my place,

01:13:24.842 --> 01:13:27.217
it was the first time
he was coming over.

01:13:27.218 --> 01:13:31.466
And, I was terrified
when he didn't show up.

01:13:31.467 --> 01:13:34.050
What, dad was a no show?

01:13:34.051 --> 01:13:36.841
Or so I thought,
and I was heartbroken

01:13:36.842 --> 01:13:40.967
when I stood outside of that store
for like an hour,

01:13:40.968 --> 01:13:43.299
I mean, just crushed
that he didn't show up.

01:13:43.300 --> 01:13:45.800
So about 30 minutes
after he was supposed to show,

01:13:45.801 --> 01:13:48.591
this pickup truck pulls up,
and he's in the back of it,

01:13:48.592 --> 01:13:52.174
and there's this old couple in the front
seat and they're waving at me,

01:13:52.175 --> 01:13:55.758
and well it turns out that,

01:13:55.759 --> 01:13:59.132
his brand new car had gotten
crashed into at the dorm,

01:13:59.133 --> 01:14:00.966
and instead of
worrying about his car,

01:14:00.967 --> 01:14:04.425
he was more worried about
how I'd feel if he didn't show up.

01:14:05.883 --> 01:14:08.967
And it was at that moment
I fell in love with him,

01:14:08.968 --> 01:14:11.132
him pulling up with
his wind whipped hair

01:14:11.133 --> 01:14:15.800
and that goofy grin on his
face, not a worry in the world.

01:14:15.801 --> 01:14:17.467
I like that story.

01:14:21.676 --> 01:14:25.175
And some day,
you're gonna have one too.

01:15:05.051 --> 01:15:06.968
Hey, what's wrong?
You alright?

01:15:09.051 --> 01:15:10.300
I don't know.

01:15:12.676 --> 01:15:13.883
What happened?

01:15:13.884 --> 01:15:15.883
Like last night,
after the bachelorette party,

01:15:15.884 --> 01:15:19.467
you said you passed out
on some lawn?

01:15:19.468 --> 01:15:21.549
It was a whole thing...

01:15:24.509 --> 01:15:26.591
Do you have time to talk?

01:15:27.676 --> 01:15:29.634
Like, like really talk?

01:15:32.759 --> 01:15:35.590
Yeah, of course, of course
I have time to talk,

01:15:35.591 --> 01:15:37.592
if it's important, yeah.

01:15:38.841 --> 01:15:39.841
It is.

01:15:47.884 --> 01:15:51.134
- Sure you wanna do this?
- Yeah.

01:15:54.092 --> 01:15:55.342
I'm sorry.

01:16:11.258 --> 01:16:13.591
This place is really cute.

01:16:15.634 --> 01:16:20.342
Yep, it's a treasure trove for brides
on a budget, or so I hear.

01:16:22.051 --> 01:16:24.757
Sometimes I say things,
and they come out of my mouth

01:16:24.758 --> 01:16:27.423
and they just sound ridiculous.

01:16:27.424 --> 01:16:29.092
Join the club.

01:16:32.383 --> 01:16:36.633
Hey, so I read these vows
that you wrote,

01:16:36.634 --> 01:16:38.757
and I took them to heart,

01:16:38.758 --> 01:16:41.049
and I asked my husband
for a divorce.

01:16:41.050 --> 01:16:42.257
What?

01:16:42.258 --> 01:16:44.590
- No, I didn't want...
- It wasn't because of you.

01:16:44.591 --> 01:16:46.966
It was a long time coming,

01:16:46.967 --> 01:16:49.801
and your words hit me,
like, hard.

01:16:51.758 --> 01:16:55.675
But the good news is, is that
we're not getting a divorce.

01:16:55.676 --> 01:16:58.007
We're gonna work it out, we're
gonna go through counseling,

01:16:58.008 --> 01:17:01.840
but, you know, it took me
threatening divorce

01:17:01.841 --> 01:17:04.675
for us to finally talk at all.

01:17:04.676 --> 01:17:08.217
But, I thought your
marriage was so...

01:17:08.218 --> 01:17:09.218
Perfect?

01:17:10.260 --> 01:17:13.549
Yeah, so did I,
but I guess I didn't realize

01:17:13.550 --> 01:17:15.675
how much work it actually took.

01:17:15.676 --> 01:17:18.799
I mean, Preston's been so busy
with his career,

01:17:18.800 --> 01:17:20.383
and I've been so busy
telling everyone

01:17:20.384 --> 01:17:23.216
how to have their own
perfect marriage that,

01:17:23.217 --> 01:17:27.175
I didn't realize how unhappy
I was on my own.

01:17:27.176 --> 01:17:29.966
We never spent
any time together.

01:17:29.967 --> 01:17:32.049
That's the reason
why we don't have kids.

01:17:32.050 --> 01:17:33.966
Maybe that'll change now.

01:17:33.967 --> 01:17:36.924
That's so good, I hope it does.

01:17:36.925 --> 01:17:39.591
Anyway, I wanted to thank you.

01:17:40.758 --> 01:17:42.591
My rules really did need work.

01:17:43.967 --> 01:17:46.967
But you really do have
a great grasp on things,

01:17:46.968 --> 01:17:49.675
and you're gonna be more
than the perfect bride.

01:17:49.676 --> 01:17:53.715
You're gonna be a good wife,
which is much more important.

01:17:53.716 --> 01:17:56.007
Well, I don't know about that.

01:17:56.008 --> 01:17:59.508
I actually ended my engagement
last night.

01:18:00.634 --> 01:18:01.634
You did?

01:18:02.842 --> 01:18:06.924
I just, realized Jordan
wasn't the one for me.

01:18:06.925 --> 01:18:09.674
It's kinda like you said,
I spent so much time

01:18:09.675 --> 01:18:12.048
telling myself how happy I was,

01:18:12.049 --> 01:18:15.384
I realized I wasn't really happy at all.

01:18:17.591 --> 01:18:19.633
So I guess we really are alike.

01:18:21.383 --> 01:18:24.216
Two clueless sister brides.

01:18:24.217 --> 01:18:25.966
Well hey, in that case,
you should keep these,

01:18:25.967 --> 01:18:29.132
and remember them the next time
you're trying to get married.

01:18:29.133 --> 01:18:31.133
My one wish for you.

01:19:05.883 --> 01:19:11.299
Hi, I'd like to order a chicken pad Thai
and an order of spring rolls.

01:19:11.300 --> 01:19:14.256
Make that two orders
of pad Thai.

01:19:14.257 --> 01:19:17.257
Actually two pad Thai,

01:19:19.591 --> 01:19:23.675
Andy Phillips, five seven nine
Aspendale, thanks.

01:19:34.008 --> 01:19:35.507
I'm sorry.

01:19:35.508 --> 01:19:38.256
I shouldn't have projected
my insecurities on to you.

01:19:38.257 --> 01:19:40.091
We both messed up.

01:19:40.092 --> 01:19:42.966
I shouldn't have called you out
so harshly,

01:19:42.967 --> 01:19:44.341
especially when I was the one
who got us

01:19:44.342 --> 01:19:46.799
into this mess of a boot camp
in the first place.

01:19:46.800 --> 01:19:49.383
Hey, at least
we both screwed up together?

01:19:53.050 --> 01:19:56.048
So, when I went in the restroom,

01:19:56.049 --> 01:20:00.216
I couldn't help but notice
Jordan's things were missing.

01:20:02.133 --> 01:20:05.632
Yeah he he moved
to a temporary place near school.

01:20:05.633 --> 01:20:07.466
Honey, I'm so sorry.

01:20:08.883 --> 01:20:12.632
It's just, I couldn't think
of one single moment

01:20:12.633 --> 01:20:15.591
in a year and a half,
when I absolutely knew

01:20:15.592 --> 01:20:17.966
I had fallen in love with him.

01:20:17.967 --> 01:20:21.632
I knew I loved him, but,
I think I got caught up

01:20:21.633 --> 01:20:24.383
in the idea of how perfect he was,

01:20:24.384 --> 01:20:27.632
and how perfect we seemed,
that it just...

01:20:27.633 --> 01:20:32.466
Andy, sometimes we fall in love
with the idea of a person

01:20:32.467 --> 01:20:34.548
more than we fall in love
with what's really

01:20:34.549 --> 01:20:37.590
right in front of us, you know?

01:20:37.591 --> 01:20:42.048
You remember that guy, Jason,
in college, who used to call me...

01:20:42.049 --> 01:20:46.591
- Mama lovin.
- I swore I was in love with him.

01:20:46.592 --> 01:20:49.425
But, how did you know with Troy?

01:20:50.633 --> 01:20:53.131
Was it the moment
that you fell in love?

01:20:53.132 --> 01:20:55.840
You know, I'm not sure, really.

01:20:57.717 --> 01:21:00.174
It's really hard to explain.

01:21:00.175 --> 01:21:05.800
But what I can say is, I've never
felt like that with anyone else.

01:21:07.132 --> 01:21:10.715
It's kind of like asking,
when did I realize

01:21:10.716 --> 01:21:13.840
that you and I would become
best friends for life?

01:21:15.882 --> 01:21:18.757
- When you know, you just, know.
- Yeah.

01:21:20.217 --> 01:21:22.590
Well, about your dress.

01:21:22.591 --> 01:21:26.381
Look, I don't care how much
you fancy up my dress,

01:21:26.382 --> 01:21:29.006
because you made it,
and I love it,

01:21:29.007 --> 01:21:31.382
and I am going to wear
the hell out of that thing

01:21:31.383 --> 01:21:34.631
in six weeks on my big day, okay?

01:21:34.632 --> 01:21:36.716
You changed it back.

01:21:39.383 --> 01:21:41.799
I love it even more this way.

01:21:47.424 --> 01:21:51.547
- It's the wine, cheers again.
- Alright, to us.

01:21:51.548 --> 01:21:53.091
To us, and life, and...

01:21:53.092 --> 01:21:54.925
- Wine.
- The trees.

01:21:58.133 --> 01:21:59.757
That is so good.

01:22:44.299 --> 01:22:49.298
And now, a few words
from my maid of honor,

01:22:49.299 --> 01:22:54.548
seamstress, and the best
friend anyone could ask for,

01:22:54.549 --> 01:22:56.633
Miss Andrea Phillips.

01:23:05.007 --> 01:23:09.256
You know, it's funny,
my friendship with Felice.

01:23:09.257 --> 01:23:14.547
We are so different,
yet for whatever reason,

01:23:14.548 --> 01:23:18.507
maybe simply cause we chose to be,
one in the same.

01:23:18.508 --> 01:23:24.174
Ever since we met, she has been
pulling me into ridiculous schemes.

01:23:24.175 --> 01:23:28.297
Most recently, she dragged me
to this thing called bridal boot camp.

01:23:28.298 --> 01:23:31.382
Yeah, it's exactly how it sounds.

01:23:31.383 --> 01:23:35.923
They have these rules you abide by
to become the perfect bride.

01:23:35.924 --> 01:23:40.924
But, I think we've all forgotten
what marriage truly means.

01:23:42.048 --> 01:23:45.383
Marriage isn't some
lofty ideal of romance,

01:23:46.675 --> 01:23:50.547
nor is it some partnership
of convenience.

01:23:50.548 --> 01:23:53.674
Instead, it's a heartfelt decision

01:23:53.675 --> 01:23:57.090
made by two people
who choose each other,

01:23:57.091 --> 01:24:01.089
despite other options and
the odds against them.

01:24:01.090 --> 01:24:05.924
And I know you're thinking,
"Okay, how do we choose right?"

01:24:05.925 --> 01:24:08.758
Well, I made some rules
of my own,

01:24:10.216 --> 01:24:12.632
that I hope might be of help.

01:24:13.966 --> 01:24:16.716
Rule number one,
know your heart.

01:24:18.048 --> 01:24:20.547
In every relationship,
each person must know

01:24:20.548 --> 01:24:24.839
what's inside their own heart
to be true to the other.

01:24:24.840 --> 01:24:28.382
And rule number two,
look good for you,

01:24:28.383 --> 01:24:32.131
because it's only when you love
and respect yourself

01:24:32.132 --> 01:24:35.715
can you give another
a similar kind of love.

01:24:35.716 --> 01:24:38.633
And rule number three,
settle down,

01:24:40.091 --> 01:24:44.091
but settle down eventually
and with the right person.

01:24:45.257 --> 01:24:49.173
Maybe there is no prince charming
out there but,

01:24:49.174 --> 01:24:53.423
if he's right for you,
he will treat you like a princess.

01:24:53.424 --> 01:24:56.174
And rule number four,
be engaged.

01:24:58.758 --> 01:25:01.923
Don't just be interested,
'cause it's only when

01:25:01.924 --> 01:25:06.048
we're engaged in each other's lives,
interests, and needs

01:25:06.049 --> 01:25:08.382
can we really grow together.

01:25:09.925 --> 01:25:14.091
And rule number five, stay strong,
but stay strong together,

01:25:16.049 --> 01:25:18.131
because when you choose right,

01:25:18.132 --> 01:25:22.548
marriage is worth much more
than the work it takes.

01:25:22.549 --> 01:25:26.298
Now, I know Felice didn't take
some silly boot camp

01:25:26.299 --> 01:25:30.465
to show you the way,
it took finding the right person,

01:25:31.633 --> 01:25:35.006
which you did,
so cheers to you both.

01:25:35.007 --> 01:25:36.632
To Felice and Troy.

01:25:37.507 --> 01:25:39.965
- Cheers!
- Cheers.

01:25:57.258 --> 01:26:00.131
That is one gorgeous dress
you designed my dear.

01:26:00.132 --> 01:26:03.714
Well, we'll see how
it does on the market.

01:26:03.715 --> 01:26:06.422
What, what are you
talking about?

01:26:06.423 --> 01:26:08.797
Whitney Walsh wants to take
some of my designs

01:26:08.798 --> 01:26:12.798
to the different retail buyers
she knows, so we'll see.

01:26:12.799 --> 01:26:16.006
Honey, this is wonderful,
congratulations!

01:26:16.007 --> 01:26:19.507
- Sweetie, we're so proud of you.
- Yeah, nice job sis.

01:26:19.508 --> 01:26:22.838
How do you feel about profit
sharing with your baby brother?

01:26:22.839 --> 01:26:23.839
No.

01:26:26.507 --> 01:26:28.382
Come on, let's dance.

01:26:29.632 --> 01:26:33.965
- Shall we join them?
- Sure, I'll be there in a second.

01:26:37.091 --> 01:26:41.382
- How's my maid of honor holding up?
- Good, how are you?

01:26:41.383 --> 01:26:45.631
I'm great, and thank you
for the speech, it was beautiful.

01:26:45.632 --> 01:26:49.298
It's really such a magical night,
isn't it?

01:26:49.299 --> 01:26:53.673
- Everything looks so beautiful.
- I know.

01:26:53.674 --> 01:26:57.047
Especially these flower
arrangements, huh?

01:26:57.048 --> 01:26:59.340
And, the guy who made them.

01:27:04.173 --> 01:27:07.089
- What is he doing here?
- I invited him.

01:27:07.090 --> 01:27:10.255
You remember that moment
we all talked about?

01:27:10.256 --> 01:27:12.839
I can feel it, and it's coming.

01:27:19.174 --> 01:27:21.673
- Hi.
- Hello.

01:27:22.799 --> 01:27:25.130
What are you doing here?

01:27:25.131 --> 01:27:32.173
Confession, this time,
I came because of you.

01:27:33.466 --> 01:27:35.422
Anyway, I couldn't
just let you do

01:27:35.423 --> 01:27:38.923
all of our favorite past times
without me, right?

01:27:38.924 --> 01:27:43.590
- Cake taste testing, and dancing.
- You are way too nice.

01:27:45.007 --> 01:27:47.924
I said some not nice things to you,

01:27:48.924 --> 01:27:52.089
things that I'm very sorry for.

01:27:52.090 --> 01:27:56.381
It's alright, truth be told,
you were right.

01:27:56.382 --> 01:27:57.756
I shouldn't have kept
coming around

01:27:57.757 --> 01:27:59.756
knowing you were
with someone else,

01:27:59.757 --> 01:28:04.548
regardless of whether my intentions
were of the gentlemanly variety.

01:28:07.049 --> 01:28:12.674
But for whatever reason, I just,
couldn't keep myself away from you.

01:28:12.675 --> 01:28:16.674
Yeah well, admittedly,
it was hard for me too.

01:28:19.215 --> 01:28:20.548
There is just...

01:28:21.839 --> 01:28:23.465
Something about us, huh?

01:28:23.466 --> 01:28:30.546
Maybe it's that we both live
in some magical garden fantasy world?

01:28:30.547 --> 01:28:34.631
Yeah, maybe, maybe.

01:28:34.632 --> 01:28:38.589
But hey, there are
worse places to live.

01:28:38.590 --> 01:28:43.172
And I heard your speech earlier,
by the way.

01:28:43.173 --> 01:28:45.881
It was really just missing
one thing.

01:28:45.882 --> 01:28:47.839
Yeah, what's that?

01:28:49.132 --> 01:28:51.799
Be kinda disgusting, but cute.

01:29:11.506 --> 01:29:12.750
Shall we?
