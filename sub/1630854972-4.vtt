No... [laughing]

11:17.100 --> 11:19.160
This administration
is crazy supportive,

11:19.360 --> 11:21.030
they're open-minded.

11:21.230 --> 11:22.380
You're going to be walking into
a very smoothly-run ecosystem--

11:22.580 --> 11:23.730
If...
If I get this job.

11:23.930 --> 11:24.950
Sure, "if", "if".

11:25.150 --> 11:26.390
I mean, no pressure,

11:26.580 --> 11:27.930
but you'd better
nail this interview.

11:28.130 --> 11:29.430
Do you have any idea
how many hand jobs I had to give

11:29.630 --> 11:30.520
to get you this meeting?

11:30.720 --> 11:31.480
Three.

11:31.680 --> 11:32.740
Eight.

11:32.940 --> 11:33.740
They were all on myself,
to set the mood,

11:33.940 --> 11:35.690
but still, I am exhausted.

11:37.130 --> 11:38.750
I should take a video
of myself right here

11:38.950 --> 11:40.360
and send it to my principal.

11:40.560 --> 11:41.920
Guy would crap his pants.

11:42.120 --> 11:43.140
Yeah?

11:43.340 --> 11:44.750
You ready
to burn that bridge?

11:44.950 --> 11:47.620
Oh, I'm ready for him
to give me everything I want.

11:47.820 --> 11:49.100
What do you mean?
What do you want?

11:49.300 --> 11:50.980
Well, it's just, you know,
if I stayed in Railton,

11:51.170 --> 11:53.760
this interview could give me
some leverage.

11:53.960 --> 11:54.810
Leverage?

11:55.000 --> 11:57.160
Well, don't you want this job?

11:57.350 --> 11:58.290
Oh, well, yeah.

11:58.490 --> 12:01.290
I mean, yeah, but, um...

12:01.490 --> 12:03.030
I mean, if I'm honest,

12:03.230 --> 12:05.110
a move would be
really hard for me right now.

12:07.160 --> 12:08.120
Well, oh, my God.

12:08.320 --> 12:09.560
Oh, my God.

12:09.760 --> 12:10.690
- Lily!
- I'm sorry, Tom.

12:10.890 --> 12:12.120
I didn't think--

12:12.470 --> 12:13.740
If I had I seen you here
and how much you obviously care,

12:13.940 --> 12:14.930
then I wouldn't have--

12:15.130 --> 12:16.700
- [exhaling]
- Do you want me to go?

12:16.900 --> 12:18.960
You could say
that I got sick or died,

12:19.160 --> 12:20.790
or got...

12:20.990 --> 12:22.700
kidnapped by big city rats.

12:22.900 --> 12:23.960
You can't bail now!

12:24.160 --> 12:25.570
If you do,
I'll look like an idiot.

12:27.000 --> 12:28.930
Just go in there and be great.

12:29.130 --> 12:30.360
Well, no, no, don't be great.

12:30.560 --> 12:33.060
Just be... medium great.

12:33.260 --> 12:34.240
[whimpers]

12:34.440 --> 12:35.320
Can you be medium?

12:35.520 --> 12:36.500
Okay.

12:36.700 --> 12:38.060
[grunting]

12:42.060 --> 12:43.460
I know that you care about
those professors,

12:43.660 --> 12:45.680
despite the fact
that you would never admit that,

12:45.880 --> 12:47.550
but you complain
about these people all the time,

12:47.750 --> 12:48.820
about their incompetence,

12:49.020 --> 12:50.300
and in the end,

12:50.490 --> 12:53.390
don't you have to think
about the students?

12:53.580 --> 12:54.680
That's not the point.

12:56.470 --> 12:57.420
Oh, I'm having a hard time

12:57.770 --> 12:59.300
figuring out
what the point is lately.

12:59.500 --> 13:02.220
<i>I have this weird feeling </i>
<i>you're going to end up in jail.</i>

13:02.420 --> 13:04.400
Or the hospital?

13:04.600 --> 13:05.180
[Tony] <i>In the hospital?</i>

13:05.380 --> 13:07.230
Or jail.

13:07.420 --> 13:08.660
I think
they're very different places.

13:08.860 --> 13:11.270
Yeah, so,
what's the common thread?

13:11.470 --> 13:12.840
I don't know, uh...

13:13.040 --> 13:14.060
Trouble?

13:14.260 --> 13:15.840
Loss of control?

13:16.040 --> 13:18.150
Yeah, that's not insight.

13:18.350 --> 13:19.500
All right.

13:19.700 --> 13:20.660
Let me think.
You punch.

13:21.840 --> 13:22.760
All right,
let's draw on philosophy.

13:22.960 --> 13:24.240
Let's articulate the question.

13:24.440 --> 13:26.720
Yeah.
Why is Lily upset with me?

13:26.920 --> 13:28.250
Well, I can't solve that
with philosophy.

13:28.450 --> 13:29.680
Here's something we can tackle,

13:29.880 --> 13:31.120
what's a good and moral way

13:31.320 --> 13:33.770
for you to handle
your current work crisis?

13:33.970 --> 13:35.210
How should you act?

13:35.410 --> 13:36.510
Do nothing.

13:36.720 --> 13:37.820
No, you act
according to your desire,

13:38.020 --> 13:39.000
unless you're a Buddhist,

13:39.200 --> 13:40.080
then you should desire nothing.

13:40.280 --> 13:41.740
That eliminates suffering.

13:41.940 --> 13:44.220
See, that's my problem
with Buddhism.

13:44.420 --> 13:46.090
Suffering,

13:46.290 --> 13:49.050
that's my sweet spot, right?

13:49.250 --> 13:51.180
At least I know I'm alive,
I'm feeling something.

13:51.380 --> 13:52.970
Huh.

13:53.170 --> 13:55.010
Maybe Lily wants you to feel
something more than suffering.

13:55.210 --> 13:56.490
Why would she want that?

13:56.690 --> 13:57.710
I don't know, you tell me.

13:57.910 --> 13:59.060
One word per punch.
Let it out.

13:59.260 --> 14:00.060
Because!

14:00.260 --> 14:01.110
It's!

14:01.300 --> 14:02.920
Boring!

14:04.270 --> 14:06.410
Because...

14:06.610 --> 14:08.230
she's bored with me.

14:12.800 --> 14:13.640
Finny.

14:13.840 --> 14:15.990
Chopping block.

14:16.190 --> 14:19.080
He teaches the fewest students
to the lowest result.

14:19.280 --> 14:21.080
High attrition rate, too.

14:21.280 --> 14:22.260
Gracie.

14:22.460 --> 14:23.130
Chopping block.

14:23.330 --> 14:24.520
She's a headache.

14:24.720 --> 14:26.740
Constantly filing grievances.

14:26.940 --> 14:29.090
Granted, she's correct,
but still.

14:29.290 --> 14:31.140
Emma?

14:31.330 --> 14:33.310
What she does
isn't even English.

14:33.510 --> 14:34.090
Chopping block.

14:34.290 --> 14:35.920
Rourke.

14:36.120 --> 14:39.140
High self-regard,
no good reason.

14:39.340 --> 14:40.800
Chopping block.

14:41.000 --> 14:43.100
The couple,
what are their names?

14:43.300 --> 14:45.630
Their names are "chopping"
and "block".

14:45.830 --> 14:48.150
Henry Devereaux Jr.?

14:48.350 --> 14:49.330
Chopping block.

14:49.530 --> 14:50.890
Top of the list.

14:51.090 --> 14:53.290
Is everyone on the list?

14:53.490 --> 14:54.900
You forgot about Billie.

14:55.100 --> 14:55.940
Okay, Billie Quigley--

14:56.140 --> 14:57.800
Chopping block.

14:59.020 --> 15:00.290
I know this is rushed,

15:00.550 --> 15:02.560
but today's groundbreaking
of the Epstein Center

15:02.760 --> 15:04.950
is giving us
a great opportunity.

15:05.150 --> 15:07.610
Now, the key thing
to any organized protest

15:07.810 --> 15:11.610
is that we're unified
in purpose and action.

15:11.810 --> 15:13.180
And what is
our purpose exactly?

15:13.380 --> 15:14.740
What are our central aims

15:14.940 --> 15:16.530
if we had to itemize them?

15:16.730 --> 15:18.970
Yeah, it's just important that
we get our message out, right?

15:19.170 --> 15:21.010
It's not about
hogging the spotlight.

15:21.210 --> 15:23.400
It kind of is
about hogging the spotlight.

15:23.600 --> 15:24.840
To get on the news

15:25.040 --> 15:27.930
and tell Harrisburg
that we mean business,

15:28.130 --> 15:29.580
that we won't tolerate
cutting jobs.

15:29.780 --> 15:32.540
Right, but Dickie Pope
doesn't need to know

15:32.740 --> 15:34.240
exactly who we are, right?

15:34.440 --> 15:36.370
I heard he's a vindictive man.

15:36.570 --> 15:37.330
Would you two stop it?

15:37.530 --> 15:38.640
Paul's right.

15:38.840 --> 15:40.770
We need to stay
focused on jobs.

15:40.970 --> 15:43.210
There will be press there.

15:43.410 --> 15:46.380
Our message, we hope,
will reach Harrisburg.

15:46.580 --> 15:48.130
So you want us all
standing outside in the cold?

15:48.320 --> 15:50.040
It's 70 degrees, Billie.

15:50.240 --> 15:50.780
I've been to most
of the departments now,

15:50.980 --> 15:52.430
and, honestly,

15:52.630 --> 15:54.610
a lot of them
are looking to you,

15:54.810 --> 15:55.570
the English department.

15:55.770 --> 15:56.790
Oh.

15:56.990 --> 15:57.960
Because of our leadership?

15:58.160 --> 15:59.350
Well, their feeling is,

15:59.550 --> 16:02.230
if... you can unite,

16:02.430 --> 16:03.750
everyone can.

16:03.950 --> 16:04.620
What's that supposed to mean?

16:04.820 --> 16:06.010
You know what it means.

16:06.210 --> 16:07.450
We file more grievances
against each other

16:07.650 --> 16:08.830
than any other department.

16:09.050 --> 16:11.540
I mean, I've never
filed one against anyone.

16:11.740 --> 16:13.190
Love you guys.

16:13.390 --> 16:14.720
If the rest of the faculty
believes

16:14.920 --> 16:16.680
that we'll submit to being
the butt of their jokes,

16:16.870 --> 16:19.370
then please tell them
to enjoy the protest without us.

16:19.570 --> 16:20.890
Easy, Finny.
Jesus.

16:24.240 --> 16:25.290
[Hank, thinking]
<i>Does everybody worry</i>

16:25.490 --> 16:26.770
<i>that they're boring?</i>

16:26.970 --> 16:28.010
<i>I've been so focused</i>

16:28.210 --> 16:29.710
<i>on all the boring people</i>
<i>around me,</i>

16:29.910 --> 16:30.800
<i>I forgot to check myself.</i>

16:31.000 --> 16:32.170
<i>Okay, let's see.</i>

16:32.370 --> 16:34.410
<i>Do I have any new thoughts?</i>

16:34.610 --> 16:36.300
<i>Uh-oh.</i>

16:36.500 --> 16:37.780
[Lily's voicemail] <i>Hi there!</i>
<i>You've got Lily's phone.</i>

16:37.980 --> 16:39.480
<i>Leave me a message. Bye!</i>

16:39.680 --> 16:40.260
[voicemail beeps]

16:40.460 --> 16:41.700
Hey, babe.

16:41.900 --> 16:45.050
I know you're working
right now.

16:45.250 --> 16:47.270
I was thinking about
that conversation we had

16:47.470 --> 16:50.740
just before you left, and...

16:51.920 --> 16:54.020
You know what,
call me when you have time.

16:54.220 --> 16:55.400
Bye.

17:04.450 --> 17:05.990
[Tony] Are we really
getting a glimpse

17:06.190 --> 17:08.340
of Jeffrey Epstein?

17:08.540 --> 17:10.290
Now, what kind of font is this?

17:10.490 --> 17:12.080
Helvetica sans testicles?

17:12.280 --> 17:13.940
Let's go say hi.

17:15.770 --> 17:16.910
Let's work out

17:17.110 --> 17:18.300
the exact mechanics
of the protest.

17:18.500 --> 17:20.260
I think the smartest way
to handle this

17:20.460 --> 17:23.350
is to let the ceremony
play out in full,

17:23.550 --> 17:25.880
and then we strike
for maximum impact.

17:26.070 --> 17:27.010
She wants to read her poem.

17:27.210 --> 17:28.750
[Leslie] What poem?

17:28.950 --> 17:30.270
"What poem?"
Which poem.

17:30.470 --> 17:33.710
The one I was asked to write
and recite,

17:33.910 --> 17:35.800
titled "Groundbreaking".

17:36.000 --> 17:38.280
You can't read
your stupid poem anymore.

17:38.480 --> 17:40.760
It will look like
you're on their side.

17:40.960 --> 17:42.330
That you would even
mention sides

17:42.530 --> 17:43.760
suggests you are not familiar
with my work.

17:43.960 --> 17:45.290
My poetry is for everybody.

17:45.490 --> 17:46.330
It joins us.

17:46.530 --> 17:48.940
It is, perhaps, our best shot

17:49.140 --> 17:51.550
at resolving this conflict
amicably.

17:51.750 --> 17:52.470
- Professor--
- Scab.

17:52.670 --> 17:54.690
Not true.

17:54.890 --> 17:55.640
It's not true.

17:55.840 --> 17:57.080
Scab.

17:57.280 --> 18:00.390
No one supports the union
more than I,

18:00.590 --> 18:02.300
but long before these cuts
were even on the table,

18:02.500 --> 18:05.780
I composed this poem
at the request of Dean Rose.

18:05.980 --> 18:07.960
I wrote it, I'm proud of it,

18:08.160 --> 18:09.440
and the poem
deserves to be heard.

18:09.640 --> 18:11.360
Okay, look.

18:11.550 --> 18:12.700
The important part,

18:12.900 --> 18:14.010
that will get on the news,

18:14.210 --> 18:15.710
is the shovels
breaking the ground.

18:15.910 --> 18:17.400
That happens at the end,

18:17.600 --> 18:20.490
so we could wait to have
the poem read before we chant.

18:20.690 --> 18:21.710
Oh, I'm not chanting.

18:21.910 --> 18:23.150
[Gracie] Thank you.
That's gracious.

18:23.350 --> 18:27.370
I do think the press
may pick up the poem

18:27.570 --> 18:29.200
once they hear it.

18:29.400 --> 18:33.030
[stifling laughter]

18:33.230 --> 18:36.340
Will there be gargoyles
on the side of building?

18:36.540 --> 18:37.770
I love gargoyles.

18:37.970 --> 18:38.690
You want gargoyles, babe?

18:38.890 --> 18:41.250
I'll get you gargoyles.

18:41.450 --> 18:44.340
I am so thankful
for Jeffrey Queequeg Epstein.

18:44.540 --> 18:46.390
Oh, no, I believe
it's Jeffrey Quidditch Epstein.

18:46.590 --> 18:47.610
- Is it?
- Yeah. Quidditch.

18:47.810 --> 18:48.740
It's neither, actually.

18:48.940 --> 18:49.700
What?

18:49.900 --> 18:50.700
There is no "Q".

18:50.900 --> 18:52.660
Yeah, there is.

18:52.860 --> 18:54.010
It's right there on the sign,

18:54.210 --> 18:55.750
- between the "Jeffrey" and the--
- Fellas,

18:55.950 --> 18:56.970
I'm Jeffrey Epstein.

18:57.170 --> 18:58.970
You're "the" Jeffrey Epstein?

18:59.170 --> 18:59.840
The one and only.

19:00.040 --> 19:01.840
I donated this building.

19:02.040 --> 19:03.190
Oh, that's
very generous of you.

19:03.390 --> 19:04.190
Thank you so much.

19:04.390 --> 19:05.020
Now, this "Q" thing?

19:05.220 --> 19:06.370
It's a crazy story.

19:06.570 --> 19:07.450
Forget about the "Q"--

19:07.650 --> 19:08.630
I'm going to the car.

19:08.830 --> 19:09.630
- Okay, baby.
- So what happened?

19:09.830 --> 19:10.810
Did they misspell your name?

19:11.010 --> 19:12.110
Because I get that
all the time.

19:12.310 --> 19:15.070
No, this "Q" thing,
it's a non-issue.

19:15.270 --> 19:17.160
If my parents had just
given me a middle name,

19:17.360 --> 19:18.360
but they didn't.

19:18.560 --> 19:20.120
All my parents gave me
was brains,

19:20.320 --> 19:23.040
and an insatiable lust
for knowledge

19:23.230 --> 19:24.990
about food technology.

19:25.190 --> 19:26.200
I don't know if you heard,

19:26.420 --> 19:27.690
they changed the tax laws
this year.

19:27.890 --> 19:29.220
I had to find
a $50 million write-off

19:29.420 --> 19:30.220
out of nowhere.

19:30.420 --> 19:31.390
Been there, yeah.

19:31.590 --> 19:32.780
Mm-hmm.

19:32.980 --> 19:34.180
I'm thinking,
let's keep it simple,

19:34.380 --> 19:35.690
maybe I'll buy a hockey team
or something.

19:35.910 --> 19:38.090
So I'm keeping my eyes
on the worst team in the league,

19:38.290 --> 19:39.460
because that's
how you find a deal, right?

19:39.660 --> 19:41.010
And then-- you're not
going to believe this--

19:41.210 --> 19:42.100
They have a winning season.

19:42.300 --> 19:43.190
They have
a winning season!

19:43.390 --> 19:44.400
- Yeah.
- ...a winning season.

19:44.600 --> 19:45.410
Yeah, we're hockey fans.

19:45.610 --> 19:46.930
And back it up a little bit.

19:47.130 --> 19:48.890
I actually have a lot of trouble
finding engineers

19:49.090 --> 19:51.240
to support
my air-fryer business.

19:51.440 --> 19:52.150
It's complicated.

19:52.350 --> 19:53.240
Fast forward again,

19:53.440 --> 19:54.760
I realize what I'll do,

19:54.960 --> 19:56.240
drop the $50 million,

19:56.440 --> 19:58.590
build the Technical
Careers Center

19:58.790 --> 19:59.790
right on this campus,

19:59.990 --> 20:01.280
which is pretty much
in my backyard.

20:01.540 --> 20:03.210
I mean, you can almost
smell my factory from here.

20:03.410 --> 20:04.420
It smells like chicken.

20:04.620 --> 20:05.900
Used to.
That's our test kitchen.

20:06.100 --> 20:07.820
We switched to rabbit recently.

20:08.020 --> 20:09.430
Anyway, point being,

20:09.630 --> 20:10.870
I got everything I want.

20:11.070 --> 20:11.870
I'm going to get
specifically-trained engineers

20:12.070 --> 20:12.820
who can come work for me.

20:13.020 --> 20:14.090
I got my tax write-off.

20:14.290 --> 20:15.480
I'm sleeping
like a champion baby.

20:15.680 --> 20:16.440
It's awesome,

20:16.640 --> 20:18.180
and then...

20:18.380 --> 20:21.700
of course,
that jerkface with my name,

20:21.900 --> 20:23.360
the other Jeffrey Epstein,

20:23.560 --> 20:25.490
he starts all that
horrible stuff with girls,

20:25.690 --> 20:26.450
and while all that's going down,

20:26.650 --> 20:27.840
Dickie Pope calls me,

20:28.040 --> 20:29.670
and he goes,
"Look, in light of everything,

20:29.870 --> 20:31.970
we've got to add a "Q".

20:32.170 --> 20:34.240
Now, this has to stay
between us, okay?

20:34.440 --> 20:35.870
Okay.

20:36.070 --> 20:39.020
I'm like, "You want a "Q",
best I can do, $40 million,"

20:39.220 --> 20:39.850
and he caves.

20:40.050 --> 20:41.370
He caves right away.

20:41.570 --> 20:42.420
He's like, "Yeah, okay,
yeah, sure, whatever."

20:42.620 --> 20:44.250
So this building cost 40 mil?

20:44.450 --> 20:45.900
No, that's the best part.

20:46.100 --> 20:48.030
That's a $50-million building.

20:48.230 --> 20:49.250
Dickie just pulled $10 million

20:49.450 --> 20:51.300
from... wherever,
I don't know.

20:51.500 --> 20:52.300
What I do know,

20:52.500 --> 20:53.340
I got everything I wanted,

20:53.540 --> 20:55.000
my write-off, my engineers.

20:55.200 --> 20:56.220
Then I had this extra $10 mil
to play with.

20:56.420 --> 20:57.690
I go, "Now I can look good--"

20:57.900 --> 21:01.440
So Dickie Pope just pulls
$10 mil from wherever.

21:01.640 --> 21:02.920
Is it possible
he found another donor?

21:03.120 --> 21:04.440
You know that's not true.

21:04.640 --> 21:07.400
All right, excuse me, I'm sorry.

21:07.600 --> 21:08.920
[Tony] So I'm in the market
for an air fryer.

21:09.120 --> 21:10.320
They're all the same, right?

21:10.520 --> 21:11.970
[Jeffrey] Absolutely not.

21:12.170 --> 21:13.890
[Tony] Generally, generally...

21:14.080 --> 21:16.410
<i>[call ringing]</i>

21:16.610 --> 21:17.930
[Lily's voicemail] <i>Hi there!</i>
<i>You've got Lily's phone,</i>

21:18.130 --> 21:19.850
<i>leave me a message. Bye!</i>

21:20.050 --> 21:21.140
<i>[voicemail beeps]</i>

21:21.410 --> 21:22.980
Honey, I know I said
you should call me,

21:23.180 --> 21:25.680
but I just heard something
that's making--

21:25.880 --> 21:28.190
I was hoping
you could talk me down.

21:30.280 --> 21:31.340
You know what?

21:31.540 --> 21:33.120
I will be fine.

21:33.320 --> 21:35.550
Okay, call me when you can.

21:39.340 --> 21:40.210
[exhales]

21:45.650 --> 21:48.180
I thought we agreed
you weren't going to pour it on.

21:48.380 --> 21:49.700
I can't turn it off.

21:49.900 --> 21:51.130
No, you can't.

21:52.310 --> 21:53.490
Thank you, Tom.

21:53.690 --> 21:54.970
Oh.

21:55.170 --> 21:55.800
Do you have to hurry back?

21:56.000 --> 21:57.230
You just got here.

21:57.430 --> 22:00.800
Yeah, but I left
some stuff in Pennsylvania.

22:01.000 --> 22:03.760
Well, look, I'm seeing Ashley
later tonight for drinks.

22:03.960 --> 22:06.370
Ashley!

22:06.570 --> 22:09.240
I didn't realize
she was back in town.

22:10.540 --> 22:12.200
Is Jenny going to be there?

22:12.400 --> 22:14.210
I haven't seen
your wife in ages.

22:14.410 --> 22:15.330
No, it'll just be
the three of us.

22:15.550 --> 22:16.900
I'm getting the band
back together.

22:17.100 --> 22:18.420
Stay.

22:20.730 --> 22:21.730
Yeah.

22:23.120 --> 22:24.300
Yeah.

22:24.500 --> 22:26.390
That sounds really good.

22:26.590 --> 22:28.830
Okay.
[clears throat]

22:29.030 --> 22:30.180
You have the phone.

22:30.380 --> 22:31.570
Okay, all right,

22:31.770 --> 22:33.570
and on...

22:33.770 --> 22:34.570
three--

22:34.770 --> 22:36.190
Okay, we're good.

22:36.380 --> 22:38.580
On three, two...

22:38.780 --> 22:40.320
I'm standing on the future site

22:40.520 --> 22:42.580
of the new multi-million-dollar
technology center

22:42.780 --> 22:44.410
here on the campus of--

22:44.610 --> 22:45.590
Bird-Shit State--

22:45.790 --> 22:46.540
Just cut.
Cut, cut, cut, cut.

22:46.740 --> 22:47.540
Can you get this?

22:47.930 --> 22:50.110
I've seen her
on the evening news.

22:50.310 --> 22:52.030
Masturbated to her.

22:52.230 --> 22:53.640
I wonder
if I can turn a fantasy

22:53.840 --> 22:56.030
into real-world fornication?

22:56.230 --> 22:57.380
I'd wish you luck, but...

22:57.580 --> 22:59.250
- Thank you.
- ...I feel awful.

22:59.450 --> 23:00.640
All right, so,
guys, it's just too noisy.

23:00.840 --> 23:02.170
We gotta lose the ducks.
Can we lose the ducks?

23:02.370 --> 23:04.210
- Somebody--
- Geese.

23:04.410 --> 23:06.520
Ducks are the small ones.

23:06.720 --> 23:07.830
Okay, well, can somebody
just escort the little bastards

23:08.020 --> 23:09.000
back to the lake?

23:09.200 --> 23:10.040
Pond.

23:10.240 --> 23:11.610
Lakes are the big ones.

23:11.810 --> 23:14.270
Well...

23:14.470 --> 23:17.050
we're here on the campus
of Podunk College

23:17.250 --> 23:18.920
speaking with an authority

23:19.120 --> 23:19.970
on every damn thing
under the sun...

23:20.170 --> 23:21.400
[chuckling]

23:21.600 --> 23:23.190
...apparently.

23:23.390 --> 23:24.490
[geese honking]

23:26.970 --> 23:29.230
[goose honking]

23:30.880 --> 23:32.240
Back off.

23:32.440 --> 23:33.850
[honking]

23:34.050 --> 23:35.330
Did you--
Did you get it all?

23:35.530 --> 23:38.900
Well, I said I would,
and I will.

23:39.100 --> 23:41.470
I'm a little bit nervous.

23:41.670 --> 23:43.120
[exhales]

23:43.320 --> 23:45.340
- You're going to crush it.
- Okay.

23:45.540 --> 23:47.080
[whispering]
"We dipped our palms..."

23:47.280 --> 23:48.080
[Finny] How will we know?

23:48.280 --> 23:49.520
Is Gracie going to cue us?

23:49.720 --> 23:51.520
Is there a particular word
she'll utter,

23:51.720 --> 23:53.600
and then we cue the trumpets
and sally forth?

23:55.210 --> 23:56.040
No, no one's sallying.

24:00.870 --> 24:03.320
[Hank, thinking] <i>Professors</i>
<i>should not hold signs.</i>

24:03.510 --> 24:04.750
<i>- They should know better.</i>
- [goose honking]

24:04.950 --> 24:07.540
<i>I mean, what's the ratio</i>
<i>of signs to change?</i>

24:07.740 --> 24:09.670
<i>We're taking billions of signs</i>
<i>over time,</i>

24:09.870 --> 24:11.580
<i>and maybe one, once,</i>

24:11.780 --> 24:13.060
<i>convinced someone</i>
<i>to change their mind?</i>

24:13.270 --> 24:16.760
<i>The only sign I like</i>
<i>is "Men Working in Trees",</i>

24:16.960 --> 24:18.900
<i>because then I know to look up,</i>

24:19.100 --> 24:20.290
<i>see the guy in the tree.</i>

24:20.490 --> 24:22.120
[Paul] Okay, guys, just...

24:22.320 --> 24:24.080
just make sure you make
a big enough scene

24:24.270 --> 24:25.860
so that the cameras point to us.

24:26.060 --> 24:28.300
If we're not on the news,
then we weren't here.

24:28.500 --> 24:30.650
Dude...

24:30.850 --> 24:32.130
Hmm?

24:32.330 --> 24:33.300
You spelled
"Humanities" wrong.

24:33.500 --> 24:35.170
What?

24:35.370 --> 24:37.310
I-I was thinking of the Latin.

24:37.510 --> 24:38.350
You were not.

24:38.550 --> 24:40.560
[♪♪]

24:45.520 --> 24:46.660
- [pecking and honking]
- Back off!

24:46.860 --> 24:49.100
- [honking and hissing]
- Shoo!

24:49.300 --> 24:51.760
You want to do this? Huh?

24:51.950 --> 24:53.450
- You want to do this?
- [honking]

24:53.650 --> 24:56.500
[chuckling]
Yeah, you picked the wrong day.

24:56.700 --> 24:57.890
- [goose honking]
- I've got all afternoon.

24:58.090 --> 24:59.590
[honking and screeching]

24:59.790 --> 25:02.940
That man is chair
of the English department.

25:03.140 --> 25:05.380
Back off, Goosey!

25:05.580 --> 25:06.900
Come on,
you want a piece of this?

25:07.100 --> 25:08.510
[goose honking and screeching]

25:08.710 --> 25:10.330
- I'm gonna kick him in the neck!
- Go film duck guy, go.

25:11.940 --> 25:13.120
[Emma] What's he doing?

25:13.320 --> 25:14.560
Come on, take your shot!

25:14.760 --> 25:16.560
He's mocking us
is what he's doing.

25:16.760 --> 25:19.390
[goose honking]

25:19.590 --> 25:21.000
Take some stills.
Get in there.

25:21.200 --> 25:22.090
[camera shutters clicking]

25:22.290 --> 25:24.000
[goose shrieking]

25:24.200 --> 25:25.520
[cameras clicking]

25:27.960 --> 25:29.010
In this corner,

25:29.210 --> 25:31.190
William Henry Devereaux

25:31.390 --> 25:32.800
of the English department,

25:33.000 --> 25:34.190
Railton College,

25:34.390 --> 25:36.540
and opposite me, a goose!

25:36.740 --> 25:38.800
[crowd laughing]

25:39.000 --> 25:40.330
[goose honking]

25:40.520 --> 25:42.370
We are here at a groundbreaking

25:42.570 --> 25:43.940
for a building
that is being paid for

25:44.140 --> 25:45.810
by cutting faculty!

25:46.010 --> 25:48.730
I heard that
directly from the mouth

25:48.920 --> 25:51.640
of the reliable, honorable
other Jeffrey Epstein.

25:51.840 --> 25:53.600
No!
No, I say!

25:53.800 --> 25:55.340
It will not stand!

25:55.540 --> 25:56.560
- [goose honking]
- I will box

25:56.760 --> 25:58.170
one of Railton's beloved geese!

25:58.370 --> 26:00.820
I will box a goose a day

26:01.020 --> 26:04.570
until I get my budget
fully funded!

26:04.770 --> 26:05.960
I'll punch him
in the upper neck

26:06.160 --> 26:07.790
and I'll punch him
in the lower neck!

26:07.990 --> 26:10.620
The goose is mostly neck.

26:10.820 --> 26:12.710
- That idiot.
- [Dean Rose, over mic] <i>Okay!</i>

26:12.910 --> 26:14.050
- [Hank] I will box him, and...
<i>- Over here, please!</i>

26:14.250 --> 26:15.580
<i>Over here, please!</i>

26:15.780 --> 26:17.620
No cutting jobs!

26:17.820 --> 26:18.970
[chanting together]
No cutting jobs!

26:19.170 --> 26:20.190
No cutting jobs!

26:20.390 --> 26:21.980
Ladies and gentlemen,

26:22.180 --> 26:23.670
I'd like to...

26:23.870 --> 26:24.800
[chanting] No cutting jobs!

26:25.000 --> 26:26.150
Here, buddy.

26:26.350 --> 26:27.500
Let's get out of here.

26:27.700 --> 26:28.960
- All right.
- Come on, come on, come on.

26:29.160 --> 26:31.290
I'd like to start
tonight's ceremony with a poem

26:31.490 --> 26:33.470
by our very own Gracie Dubois!

26:33.660 --> 26:34.680
[chanting continues]
No cutting jobs!

26:34.880 --> 26:36.380
No cutting jobs!
No cutting jobs!

26:36.580 --> 26:38.380
Gracie Dubois, everyone.

26:38.580 --> 26:40.210
No cutting jobs!
No cutting jobs!

26:40.410 --> 26:41.780
Grace!

26:41.980 --> 26:42.510
No cutting jobs! No--

26:49.300 --> 26:50.830
You're going to love
this place.

26:51.030 --> 26:52.010
She should be here.

26:52.210 --> 26:53.660
I told her to meet us at 5:00.

26:53.860 --> 26:55.880
- Lily!
- Whoo-hoo!

26:56.080 --> 26:57.710
Aw, yeah!

26:57.910 --> 26:59.880
Oh, my god,
it's so good to see you.

27:00.080 --> 27:01.010
Oh, buddy.

27:01.210 --> 27:02.150
So? How'd it go?

27:02.350 --> 27:02.890
Did you get the gig?

27:03.090 --> 27:04.190
They loved her.

27:04.390 --> 27:05.410
Let's go look for apartments
right now.

27:05.610 --> 27:06.890
Oh, that sounds so fun.

27:07.090 --> 27:08.200
[Tom] It does sound fun.
Not going to happen.

27:08.400 --> 27:09.410
We were hoodwinked.

27:09.610 --> 27:10.850
The whole interview was a con.

27:11.050 --> 27:12.680
She leveraged us, Ash.

27:12.880 --> 27:14.290
Leverage for what?

27:14.490 --> 27:15.930
Her cutthroat
public school job.

27:17.370 --> 27:19.120
You scammer!

27:19.320 --> 27:20.380
So you just flash your tits
at the old flame,

27:20.580 --> 27:21.300
and he comes running.

27:21.500 --> 27:22.650
I did not flash my tits.

27:22.840 --> 27:23.520
I did not run.

27:23.710 --> 27:24.470
You two never change.

27:24.670 --> 27:25.950
It was just--

27:26.150 --> 27:27.260
You know, it was just business.

27:27.460 --> 27:28.390
I do feel bad, though.

27:28.590 --> 27:30.520
Well, you shouldn't.

27:30.720 --> 27:32.090
Uh, since we seem to be
truth-telling,

27:32.290 --> 27:33.130
I haven't had a drink yet,

27:33.330 --> 27:36.090
but, um, the job wasn't, uh,

27:36.290 --> 27:38.700
how shall we say, really...
available.

27:38.900 --> 27:40.140
What do you mean?

27:40.340 --> 27:41.530
Well, you didn't hear this
from me,

27:41.730 --> 27:42.930
and I didn't want
to bum you out,

27:43.130 --> 27:44.510
but there was
this huge meeting last week

27:44.710 --> 27:45.930
about how they wanted to
re-commit to diversity hiring,

27:46.130 --> 27:47.280
and, so...

27:47.480 --> 27:49.720
- Oh.
- Yeah.

27:49.920 --> 27:50.720
Okay.

27:50.920 --> 27:51.720
Yeah, I get that.

27:51.920 --> 27:53.060
I really thought

27:53.320 --> 27:54.150
we were going to have her
back in New York,

27:54.350 --> 27:56.510
but, well, that's our Lily,

27:56.700 --> 27:58.330
always playing us.

27:58.530 --> 27:59.900
What? That's not me,
I don't play people.

28:00.100 --> 28:02.340
Oh, shut up and get me a drink.

28:02.540 --> 28:04.160
[Tom] Yes. Uh, drinks!

28:04.360 --> 28:05.780
Are you thinking of
getting some food, gentlemen?

28:05.970 --> 28:07.990
The drink of the day
is a Mikhail Gorbachev.

28:08.190 --> 28:09.450
What's that?

28:09.650 --> 28:11.170
It's a Moscow Mule,
served in a glass... nost.

28:11.370 --> 28:12.260
[scoffs, snorting]

28:12.460 --> 28:13.520
[groans]

28:13.720 --> 28:15.600
Uh, I'll leave you guys to it.

28:17.470 --> 28:18.090
They changed the menu,

28:18.290 --> 28:20.750
without warning.

28:20.950 --> 28:22.230
I didn't come this restaurant.

28:22.430 --> 28:24.140
I came to the one
that has the shrimp I like.

28:24.340 --> 28:25.580
[Hank whispers]
Bait and switch.

28:25.780 --> 28:27.060
I'm ordering off the old menu.

28:27.260 --> 28:28.800
From memory?

28:29.000 --> 28:31.240
I believe death
will come quickly for me.

28:31.430 --> 28:33.540
Uh, change of subject?

28:33.740 --> 28:34.500
Not because I want it to,

28:34.700 --> 28:35.890
but because

28:36.090 --> 28:37.460
most of the deepest
experiences of my life

28:37.660 --> 28:39.030
have been unexpected.

28:39.230 --> 28:41.590
The important thing
is we must prepare to transcend.

28:41.790 --> 28:42.900
Did something happen?

28:43.100 --> 28:43.900
My ex got remarried.

28:44.100 --> 28:44.990
That was years ago.

28:45.190 --> 28:45.990
The other one.

28:46.190 --> 28:47.250
We had an implicit promise

28:47.450 --> 28:48.630
that we would get back together

28:48.900 --> 28:50.600
if we were both still single
when we turned 70.

28:50.800 --> 28:51.910
I had no intention
of keeping it.

28:52.110 --> 28:53.170
I hate her, but still.

28:53.370 --> 28:54.740
Pay attention,
I'm getting somewhere.

28:54.940 --> 28:56.520
You have my attention.

28:56.720 --> 28:59.000
I've decided fornication

28:59.200 --> 29:00.440
may no longer be
the primary goal.

29:00.640 --> 29:02.400
It may, in fact,
be counterproductive.

29:02.600 --> 29:04.220
You have half my attention.

29:04.420 --> 29:06.490
The body deteriorates.

29:06.690 --> 29:08.930
It reminds us that time,

29:09.120 --> 29:12.580
although an illusion,
is a robust one.

29:12.780 --> 29:14.060
All we can do is watch.

29:14.260 --> 29:17.020
First go the knees,
then the spleen,

29:17.220 --> 29:20.150
then the rest of the body,
the whole thing,

29:20.350 --> 29:22.980
until we're just
a ghost in the machine,

29:23.180 --> 29:24.810
then no machine.

29:25.010 --> 29:27.590
Casey Jones without a train.

29:29.370 --> 29:30.990
[Paul] There he is,

29:31.190 --> 29:32.820
the bird boxer.

29:33.020 --> 29:34.430
Quite a prank.

29:34.630 --> 29:36.000
Say thank you.
Look--

29:36.200 --> 29:37.300
You knew what we were planning.

29:37.500 --> 29:38.390
Said he didn't want
any part of it.

29:38.590 --> 29:39.780
I--

29:39.980 --> 29:42.310
Then you go and upstage
the entire thing.

29:42.510 --> 29:43.790
The whole goddamn thing.

29:43.990 --> 29:44.790
Shut up, Billie.

29:44.990 --> 29:46.440
The whole goddamn thing.

29:46.640 --> 29:49.440
In my defense,
the goose was an asshole.

29:49.640 --> 29:51.050
[Paul] In your defense,

29:51.250 --> 29:53.840
it was a pretty big F-U
to the administration

29:54.040 --> 29:56.090
for a guy who says
he's not a union man.

29:58.180 --> 30:00.530
Come join us, jackass.

30:04.670 --> 30:06.160
[rapping fingers on tabletop]

30:06.360 --> 30:07.200
[laughing]

30:07.400 --> 30:08.620
No, listen, listen, listen.

30:08.810 --> 30:11.290
So, there wasn't a school system
in the country

30:11.490 --> 30:12.900
that wasn't
completely uprooted by Covid,

30:13.100 --> 30:14.420
but even, you know,

30:14.630 --> 30:16.910
with all the staff turnover
and the budget fights,

30:17.110 --> 30:18.260
and all the other crap
that goes along with it,

30:18.450 --> 30:19.470
I've got to say
we fared pretty well.

30:19.670 --> 30:20.740
[Tom] Pretty well?

30:20.940 --> 30:22.300
Top 20 charter school
in the city.

30:22.500 --> 30:24.830
Top 15, depending on
which report you read.

30:25.030 --> 30:26.700
Last week, I cleaned up
a student's piss

30:26.900 --> 30:28.730
because my janitor
felt it was beneath him.

30:31.040 --> 30:32.010
Gross.

30:32.210 --> 30:33.570
[chuckles]

30:35.090 --> 30:36.230
You know what it is?

30:36.430 --> 30:38.320
This Arlyle job,

30:38.520 --> 30:40.760
it, like,
got my engine running again.

30:40.960 --> 30:42.670
I'm listening to you
talk about your schools

30:42.870 --> 30:44.280
and your careers,

30:44.480 --> 30:47.370
and that's the reason
that we went to grad school

30:47.570 --> 30:48.500
in the first place.

30:48.700 --> 30:50.420
That was always the dream,

30:50.620 --> 30:52.900
and I just... miss it.

30:53.100 --> 30:54.500
Miss it?

30:54.720 --> 30:56.820
I'm sure you talk like this
at home all the time, no?

30:57.020 --> 30:58.600
[chuckles ruefully]

30:58.800 --> 31:00.210
Oh, my God.

31:00.410 --> 31:01.340
Do you know

31:01.540 --> 31:02.910
Hank just publicly announced

31:03.110 --> 31:05.130
that all the students
and teachers at Railton

31:05.330 --> 31:07.730
should resign themselves
to their mediocrity.

31:09.340 --> 31:10.700
- Oh, shit.
- Oh...

31:10.900 --> 31:11.690
Yeah.

31:11.910 --> 31:14.700
I mean, he was kidding, but...

31:14.900 --> 31:16.360
no, he wasn't.

31:16.560 --> 31:17.270
[laughing and chatting]

31:17.470 --> 31:18.270
Whoa!

31:18.470 --> 31:20.620
Hey!

31:20.820 --> 31:21.800
What's everybody else having?

31:22.000 --> 31:23.280
- [laughing]
- That's a good one...

31:23.480 --> 31:25.580
- [groaning and bantering]
- Mean lady...

31:25.780 --> 31:27.540
- Let's do this.
- There we go.

31:27.740 --> 31:30.110
Uh, here is to Dickie Pope

31:30.310 --> 31:32.370
and the look on his face.

31:32.570 --> 31:33.710
- Oh, wow.
- [all clinking glasses]

31:36.110 --> 31:37.940
Gracie, your poem, your ode.

31:38.140 --> 31:39.510
You never had a chance
to read it.

31:39.710 --> 31:40.510
[Billie] Come on,
we want to hear it.

31:40.710 --> 31:41.770
[all agreeing]
Come on!

31:41.970 --> 31:43.210
- Go ahead.
- Yeah!

31:43.410 --> 31:46.600
No, I think the focus
is split at the moment.

31:46.800 --> 31:47.930
- No, we wanna hear it.
- Come on.

31:48.130 --> 31:49.480
Trust us,
this will never happen again,

31:49.680 --> 31:50.520
- so...
- [laughter]

31:50.720 --> 31:52.000
We're happy to hear it.

31:52.200 --> 31:52.950
Go for it.

31:54.300 --> 31:56.000
[tapping glass]

32:01.520 --> 32:05.750
"We dipped our palms
in chalk to

32:05.950 --> 32:08.760
"keep our hands
from letting go,

32:08.960 --> 32:10.840
and..."

32:15.490 --> 32:16.680
Go on, Gracie.

32:16.880 --> 32:19.160
This is as quiet
as the bar's going to get.

32:19.360 --> 32:20.250
No, I--

32:20.450 --> 32:21.380
Yeah, finish the poem.

32:21.580 --> 32:23.340
- Yeah, come on.
- Finish it.

32:23.540 --> 32:24.850
That's the end.

32:26.680 --> 32:28.910
So read the beginning.

32:29.110 --> 32:32.960
No, that...
That was the...

32:33.150 --> 32:35.440
Well, perhaps
you can read it again

32:35.640 --> 32:37.570
now that we know more
about what to expect.

32:37.770 --> 32:39.830
You did end it with an "and".
