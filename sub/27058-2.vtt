00:11.740 --> 00:13.060
Matthieu!

00:19.940 --> 00:21.260
Over there.

01:21.540 --> 01:23.578
I used to know a Matthew.

01:23.580 --> 01:25.100
It's Matthieu.

02:19.180 --> 02:21.180
You have blood on your face.

02:40.060 --> 02:41.380
Matthew!

02:55.017 --> 02:57.885

02:59.380 --> 03:02.018
Once the world was full of wonders,

03:02.020 --> 03:04.778
but it belongs to humans now.

03:04.780 --> 03:06.898
We creatures
have all but disappeared -

03:06.900 --> 03:10.378
demons, vampires and witches...

03:10.380 --> 03:14.060
hiding in plain sight,
ill at ease, even with each other.

03:15.060 --> 03:21.138
But, as my father used to say,
in every ending...

03:21.140 --> 03:23.580
there is a new beginning.

03:25.700 --> 03:27.698
-New trousers, Hamish?
-Morning.

03:27.700 --> 03:30.378
You really didn't need to be here,
you know.

03:30.380 --> 03:33.618
"Hello, Hamish. Nice to see you."
Good to see you, too, Matthew.

03:33.620 --> 03:36.258
-I can quite well go hunting on my own.
-It's good to have a break from London.

03:36.260 --> 03:38.498
I've been meaning to get out
on the moors, anyway.

03:38.500 --> 03:40.060
John's preparing the car.

03:57.700 --> 03:59.338
I see you've redecorated.

03:59.340 --> 04:00.858
I thought the place
needed brightening up.

04:00.860 --> 04:02.180
Looks like a wedding cake.

04:04.740 --> 04:08.498
You didn't come all the way up here
to diss my interiors, Matt.

04:08.500 --> 04:09.978
-What's going on?
-It's complex.

04:09.980 --> 04:12.218
Isn't it always with you?

04:12.220 --> 04:14.578
-This is even more...
-What? Fucked up?

04:14.580 --> 04:18.140
Look at the two of us.
A vampire friends with a demon.

04:20.339 --> 04:22.780
I came up here
to get away from a witch.

04:25.580 --> 04:28.020
When you say "get away"...

04:28.820 --> 04:30.700
-do you mean?
-I'm craving her.

06:48.020 --> 06:50.098
Who are you?
You can't come in here without...

06:50.100 --> 06:52.138
My boss will call you
in three seconds to give it.

06:52.140 --> 06:54.340
I'm looking for the body
of the tourist found last night.

06:58.060 --> 06:59.380
Yes?

07:00.220 --> 07:01.540
Yes.

07:02.060 --> 07:03.380
Of course, sir.

07:09.100 --> 07:10.420
The body?

07:15.980 --> 07:17.620
He has no blood in him.

07:18.540 --> 07:22.220
And there was no blood at the scene.
It's... strange.

07:22.940 --> 07:24.660
Is there any background on him?

07:30.860 --> 07:32.220
He was French.

07:33.300 --> 07:34.620
Name?

07:35.180 --> 07:37.260
Matthieu Beny.

07:42.420 --> 07:43.740
Matthew.

07:58.580 --> 07:59.900
Stop.

08:05.700 --> 08:08.820
-Where?
-About 35 meters below the ridgeline.

08:17.260 --> 08:18.580
Good hunting.

08:51.460 --> 08:55.298
-Hey. Busy today.
-Don't know why.

08:55.300 --> 08:57.220
Students aren't back yet.

10:02.980 --> 10:04.340
Dr Bishop.

10:05.740 --> 10:07.458
May I help you?

10:07.460 --> 10:09.380
My name's Peter Knox.

10:11.980 --> 10:15.940
I presume there aren't usually this
many other creatures in the library.

10:18.180 --> 10:19.740
Well... no.

10:21.300 --> 10:25.580
So I suppose word has spread about
the Ashmole manuscript you took out.

10:28.580 --> 10:30.818
Sorry, I'm waiting on a book.

10:30.820 --> 10:33.218
You're quite right to keep it quiet,

10:33.220 --> 10:36.460
but I assure you I am a friend.

10:57.340 --> 10:59.580
Shall we discuss this over coffee?

11:00.460 --> 11:01.780
I don't think so.

11:02.740 --> 11:05.180
Or are you a tea drinker
like your mother was?

11:24.150 --> 11:26.310
Did you know my father, too?

11:27.270 --> 11:28.790
Only slightly.

11:30.070 --> 11:32.910
Your mother and I met
when we were teenagers.

11:34.790 --> 11:36.750
I was very fond of her.

11:37.950 --> 11:39.910
What was she like?

11:41.870 --> 11:44.228
Passionate, clever,

11:44.230 --> 11:46.588
stubborn as a mule
when she wanted to be.

11:46.590 --> 11:47.950
Really?!

11:49.790 --> 11:52.030
It's truly terrible what happened.

11:53.350 --> 11:56.388
I've thought about you
a good deal over the years and...

11:56.390 --> 12:00.190
I've wanted to introduce myself,
but your aunt's very protective.

12:01.190 --> 12:02.510
Yeah.

12:04.990 --> 12:07.390
-Could we get tea for two, please?
-Yes, sir.

12:17.150 --> 12:18.670
Feeling better?

12:19.110 --> 12:20.510
Yes.

12:21.430 --> 12:22.790
Thank you.

12:26.230 --> 12:28.910
I think you're wise
to keep your distance from the witch.

12:30.550 --> 12:34.628
Yes. But the problem is, she's in
possession of something that I need.

12:34.630 --> 12:35.950
Or rather...

12:36.710 --> 12:38.790
she's capable of retrieving it.

12:41.150 --> 12:44.548
-So, er, did you just call it up?
-Yeah.

12:44.550 --> 12:46.188
How?

12:46.190 --> 12:48.348
Er, the... the normal way.

12:48.350 --> 12:52.388
That's odd because I requested
Ashmole 782 this morning

12:52.390 --> 12:53.908
and it isn't there.

12:53.910 --> 12:55.828
-Not there?
-Missing.

12:55.830 --> 12:59.190
According to the Bodleian catalog
it's been missing for years.

13:00.910 --> 13:03.108
But how could it be?

13:03.110 --> 13:04.988
That doesn't make any sense.
I took it out.

13:04.990 --> 13:07.348
You did return it, I take it?

13:07.350 --> 13:08.988
Of course!

13:08.990 --> 13:11.028
I would never steal a book from the Bod.

13:11.030 --> 13:13.830
No. It could be the date.

13:14.950 --> 13:19.148
Yeah. Maybe the book only shows itself
around the time of the equinox.

13:19.150 --> 13:22.068
Or... or it could be
that there's a spell on it

13:22.070 --> 13:24.628
and that somehow, for some reason,
you broke it.

13:24.630 --> 13:27.990
I'm not my mother, Mr Knox,
I didn't inherit her powers.

13:30.310 --> 13:33.068
-What happened when you opened it?
-I only looked at one page.

13:33.070 --> 13:34.948
What was on it?

13:34.950 --> 13:36.750
-A picture.
-Of what?

13:37.750 --> 13:39.228
The alchemical child.

13:39.230 --> 13:41.190
There must have been more.
You must have seen more.

13:42.470 --> 13:44.148
Why is it so important to you?

13:44.150 --> 13:46.828
Because if this book
is what I think it is,

13:46.830 --> 13:49.230
it contains the witches' first spells.

13:50.310 --> 13:53.470
It could tell us
how we created vampires.

13:54.470 --> 13:56.748
-That's just a myth.
-Vampires have used

13:56.750 --> 13:58.748
their brute power and longevity

13:58.750 --> 14:02.590
to gain far too much control,
but if we created them...

14:04.030 --> 14:05.710
then we could uncreate them.

14:12.390 --> 14:14.110
I won't have any part of that.

14:16.070 --> 14:18.908
You have to try and take it out again.

14:18.910 --> 14:20.948
You're the only person
who's seen it in years.

14:20.950 --> 14:22.830
Let go of my arm!

14:27.990 --> 14:30.110
I'm quite sure
I'll see you again, Diana.

14:40.590 --> 14:42.510
Not as amenable as I'd hoped.

14:43.710 --> 14:46.230
We might need to use firmer tactics.

14:58.670 --> 15:00.228
Juliette, good evening.

15:00.230 --> 15:02.988
If you're here to see my father,
he's not to be disturbed.

15:02.990 --> 15:05.430
I think he's going to want to hear
what I have to say.

15:18.470 --> 15:20.670
This better be important.

15:29.510 --> 15:30.830
It is.

15:32.030 --> 15:33.830
It's a police matter.

15:37.230 --> 15:38.670
Leave us.

15:48.110 --> 15:50.548
To be honest, I still don't get
what you're so anxious about.

15:50.550 --> 15:53.908
How could taking out a book
for a senior witch do any harm?

15:53.910 --> 15:56.988
Come on, you were in the library.
You felt it.

15:56.990 --> 16:00.668
This... this book is powerful
and I...I don't...

16:00.670 --> 16:04.910
I don't trust what Peter Knox might
do with it. He hates other species.

16:06.110 --> 16:07.748
He'll use it against them.

16:07.750 --> 16:10.108
It's no concern of ours.

16:10.110 --> 16:13.428
I don't even know how he knew
I took it out in the first place.

16:13.430 --> 16:15.948
-These things get out.
-I just...

16:15.950 --> 16:18.748
I don't want to have
anything to do with it.

16:18.750 --> 16:22.028
I want to lead a normal life.
I want to be normal.

16:22.030 --> 16:25.268
I've known you for ten years.
You couldn't be normal if you tried.

16:25.270 --> 16:28.350
It's so typical something like this
would happen to you.

16:32.830 --> 16:34.470
What shall do, Gillian?

16:35.550 --> 16:37.830
Just get it out for him
and forget all about it.

16:38.750 --> 16:40.228
Carry on with your paper.

16:40.230 --> 16:43.948
Yeah, but that's nearly impossible
with all these...

16:43.950 --> 16:45.470
creatures and the library.

16:46.350 --> 16:48.268
Not the vampire
that was following you before?

16:48.270 --> 16:51.708
No.
He seems to have given up on me.

16:51.710 --> 16:53.550
Oh, that's are relief at least.

16:55.510 --> 16:57.308
I don't know.

16:57.310 --> 16:59.310
There is something about him.

17:01.030 --> 17:04.869
CHe... He seemed to know more
about the book than anyone else.

17:06.589 --> 17:09.188
I should asked him about it.
Instead, I...

17:09.190 --> 17:12.310
-I told him to leave me alone.
-You're quite right, too.

17:15.510 --> 17:18.068
Have you ever talked to them?

17:18.069 --> 17:20.308
No.

17:20.310 --> 17:21.907
So you don't know what they're like?

17:21.910 --> 17:24.150
And you do, after one conversation?

17:27.829 --> 17:31.750
He didn't seem to be as prejudiced
against us as we are against them.

17:40.030 --> 17:41.868
I gotta go.

17:41.870 --> 17:44.428
Been invited to one
of the dean's awful parties.

17:44.430 --> 17:46.068
Thank you.

17:46.070 --> 17:48.110
Sorry to burden you with this.

17:51.030 --> 17:55.348
So even though Ashmole 782 might be
the answer to our problems, Hamish,

17:55.350 --> 17:57.868
my interest in it puts her in danger.

17:57.870 --> 18:01.468
It seems we're all in danger, Matt,
if we don't get that book.

18:01.470 --> 18:03.948
You know that daemon suicides
are on the rise?

18:03.950 --> 18:06.068
As are mental health problems,
homelessness.

18:06.070 --> 18:08.068
Yes, I know.

18:08.070 --> 18:10.068
I've been looking into the statistics.

18:10.070 --> 18:12.110
We are struggling.

18:12.990 --> 18:14.988
If this book could
explain our origins...

18:14.990 --> 18:18.150
Yes. Wouldn't that be
something, my friend?

18:31.870 --> 18:34.228
-Where's Matthew?
-He's not here.

18:34.230 --> 18:36.950
Oh, just, he said he'd ring me
with the results.

18:40.310 --> 18:41.910
Have they come through yet?

18:43.710 --> 18:45.550
James' have.

18:51.030 --> 18:53.030
His blood tests are normal.

18:58.670 --> 19:00.950
So the problem's with me then?

19:02.750 --> 19:04.270
It seems so.

19:17.950 --> 19:19.510
That was quick.

19:24.630 --> 19:26.150
What did you do to your hand?

19:28.150 --> 19:30.590
I think the book did that to you
when you opened it.

19:32.710 --> 19:35.828
Who are you?
You were in the library.

19:35.830 --> 19:38.508
You were the magnet for it.

19:38.510 --> 19:40.590
Magic attracts magic.

19:43.030 --> 19:45.630
But yours is hidden.

20:00.750 --> 20:03.470
Someone did something to you.

20:06.430 --> 20:07.750
Oh.

20:08.870 --> 20:10.390
You did it to yourself.

20:20.870 --> 20:23.148
Do you fear persecution?

20:23.150 --> 20:24.590
Is that it?

20:25.270 --> 20:26.750
I haven't until now.

20:27.830 --> 20:32.350
You were with Peter Knox.
You tell him I won't get out his book.

20:33.590 --> 20:35.910
This isn't just about the book.

20:37.830 --> 20:39.230
It's about you.

20:59.345 --> 21:00.823
Hey, Em.

21:00.825 --> 21:03.743
-Have you heard of Peter Knox?
-Peter Knox is in Oxford?

21:03.745 --> 21:05.223
He said he knew Mum.

21:05.225 --> 21:08.703
-Yeah, he was crazy about her.
-I thought so, from what he said.

21:08.705 --> 21:10.543
Tried to persuade her
not to marry your father.

21:10.545 --> 21:12.063
Did she like him?

21:12.065 --> 21:15.823
They were friends in the early days
and then he just got into some stuff.

21:15.825 --> 21:18.903
-What?
-Dark magic.

21:18.905 --> 21:21.143
Why is Peter Knox in Oxford?

21:21.145 --> 21:22.903
The book I told you about.

21:22.905 --> 21:24.783
He wants it.

21:24.785 --> 21:27.905
Your father distrusted him
and, by the end, your mum did too.

21:29.025 --> 21:31.545
Be careful of him, Diana.

21:39.665 --> 21:40.985
Juliette.

21:42.545 --> 21:43.905
A word.

21:56.145 --> 21:58.945
Where were you two nights ago?

21:59.945 --> 22:02.303
Seeing the city at night.

22:02.305 --> 22:04.623
You said I was allowed.

22:04.625 --> 22:06.343
I said...

22:06.345 --> 22:09.583
as long as you were good.

22:09.585 --> 22:13.543
-I have been.
-If there's something I don't know,

22:13.545 --> 22:16.183
Baldwin can use it against me.

22:16.185 --> 22:20.663
-Baldwin's not even in Venice.
-He sees and hears anyway!

22:20.665 --> 22:22.783
This dead tourist...

22:22.785 --> 22:26.183
is a brazen vampire killing.

22:26.185 --> 22:28.703
And Domenico...

22:28.705 --> 22:31.625
the nosey little fucker...

22:32.825 --> 22:35.783
smelt you on him.

22:35.785 --> 22:38.063
That's not true.

22:38.065 --> 22:40.145
Domenico hates me.

23:05.705 --> 23:07.025
Matthew!

23:26.105 --> 23:28.863
You taught me to crave Matthew!

23:28.865 --> 23:30.185
No!

23:31.385 --> 23:34.823
Father! Father!

23:34.825 --> 23:37.463
This book you say Diana called up.

23:37.465 --> 23:40.103
-Mm.
-I've heard stories about it.

23:40.105 --> 23:43.183
The witches stole it from the vampires.
The vampires stole it from the witches.

23:43.185 --> 23:46.543
-That's untrue.
-Demons, of course, don't get a look in.

23:46.545 --> 23:48.303
We know it's important to us
but we don't know why

23:48.305 --> 23:50.785
and we're not even allowed to ask.

23:51.785 --> 23:54.943
The general feeling being we matter
so much less than the other creatures.

23:54.945 --> 23:56.943
Can we not have a political argument?

23:56.945 --> 23:59.383
It's easy for you to say. You're not
treated like a third-class citizen.

23:59.385 --> 24:01.225
It's hardly like you are.

24:02.145 --> 24:03.823
You practically run
the City of London.

24:03.825 --> 24:06.865
That's not the point. I'm an anomaly.

24:09.665 --> 24:10.985
Checkmate.

24:12.945 --> 24:15.025
There is more to the game
than protecting your queen.

24:24.785 --> 24:27.063
Wait! Think before your next move.

24:27.065 --> 24:29.823
No, other creatures
will want the book.

24:29.825 --> 24:32.343
I have to obtain it from Diana
before they do.

24:32.345 --> 24:34.543
I know you need the book,
but couldn't Marcus do it?

24:34.545 --> 24:37.543
Marcus? Not letting Marcus
anywhere near Diana.

24:37.545 --> 24:40.143
He's much less of a danger
to Diana than you are!

24:40.145 --> 24:42.823
Think what's happened in the past
to women you've craved.

24:42.825 --> 24:44.865
Elena, Cecilia.

24:46.865 --> 24:48.623
I wish I'd never told you.

24:48.625 --> 24:51.745
But you did because you wanted me
to be your conscience.

24:53.305 --> 24:55.263
After Cecilia,

24:55.265 --> 24:57.623
I swore to myself that
I would never get involved

24:57.625 --> 24:59.783
with another warmblood again
and you know that!

24:59.785 --> 25:02.663
But, Matt, you've never
talked about another woman

25:02.665 --> 25:05.065
the way you do about Diana Bishop.

25:06.465 --> 25:08.545
I'm just trying to protect you.

25:09.545 --> 25:12.263
-I'll try to take your advice.
-Don't try.

25:12.265 --> 25:17.185
Do. If you hurt her, you'll never
forgive yourself and I couldn't bear it.

25:17.745 --> 25:19.463
Don't go back to Oxford

25:19.465 --> 25:23.025
until you're sure you can control
yourself around Diana Bishop.

25:39.185 --> 25:40.663
Dr Bishop.

25:40.665 --> 25:43.623
-Good evening, Professor Marsh.
-Welcome.

25:43.625 --> 25:48.023
-Thank you.
-I understand you gave an excellent talk

25:48.025 --> 25:50.743
and that you are writing it up.

25:50.745 --> 25:52.903
Yes, yes, I am indeed.

25:52.905 --> 25:55.903
And I look forward to reading it.

25:55.905 --> 26:00.383
-We want to get you on that shortlist.
-Well, thank you.

26:00.385 --> 26:04.863
Now, there's someone
I would really like you to meet.

26:04.865 --> 26:08.743
He has a very interesting
specialization,

26:08.745 --> 26:12.745
the occult... sciences.

26:18.105 --> 26:21.185
Alchemy. It's quite a subject.

26:22.785 --> 26:26.745
Especially for someone who says
she lacks interest in magic.

26:28.185 --> 26:30.223
I don't just lack interest.

26:30.225 --> 26:33.663
-I lack aptitude.
-Are you sure?

26:33.665 --> 26:35.863
The book came out for you
and no one else.

26:35.865 --> 26:38.783
I told you,
I don't know how that happened.

26:38.785 --> 26:41.465
But you didn't tell me
a vampire's been following you.

26:42.505 --> 26:43.983
How do you know that?

26:43.985 --> 26:46.703
It would be catastrophic
if it falls into their hands.

26:46.705 --> 26:49.263
Can't you see the danger you're in?

26:49.265 --> 26:51.183
I can take care of myself.

26:51.185 --> 26:53.343
Laudable, but naive.

26:53.345 --> 26:55.863
The fact that vampires
are now involved

26:55.865 --> 26:57.423
makes this so much more urgent.

26:57.425 --> 27:00.143
-I'm not going to call it up for you.
-Why not?

27:00.145 --> 27:05.023
Because I don't happen to like
the idea of uncreating other species.

27:05.025 --> 27:07.463
They would do exactly the same to us,
if they could.

27:07.465 --> 27:12.105
I'm like my mother, Mr Knox.
If I've made up my mind,

27:12.465 --> 27:14.385
I don't change it.

27:21.545 --> 27:22.865
Diana.

27:24.985 --> 27:27.345
Think about what you're doing.

27:28.625 --> 27:30.703
You must be true to your blood,

27:30.705 --> 27:32.823
your heritage.

27:32.825 --> 27:35.425
Don't make me force you
to recall that book.

27:40.225 --> 27:41.545
Diana.

27:42.705 --> 27:44.185
Don't walk away!

27:50.345 --> 27:52.745
You can't escape me that easily.

27:54.105 --> 27:56.825
I can be with you wherever you are.

27:58.305 --> 28:00.583
I need the book.

28:00.585 --> 28:02.865
We need the book.

28:14.865 --> 28:17.065
Get out of my head!

28:58.185 --> 28:59.823
How's it going with Diana?

28:59.825 --> 29:02.543
Did she get the manuscript
out for you?

29:02.545 --> 29:03.865
No.

29:05.545 --> 29:08.583
Last night, she performed
an elemental spell.

29:08.585 --> 29:13.783
-What? Diana did?
-Did you know she was powerful?

29:13.785 --> 29:15.423
No, I... I...

29:15.425 --> 29:17.423
I can't believe...

29:17.425 --> 29:19.865
She's never shown she is.

29:22.265 --> 29:26.225
Maybe she's used her magic
to forward her career.

29:28.705 --> 29:31.825
And that's why
she's kept it secret from you.

29:40.745 --> 29:43.745
Oh, thank God you're here.
You haven't been answering your phone.

30:04.745 --> 30:08.023
If this book is what I think it is,
vampires...

30:08.025 --> 30:10.345
then we could uncreate them.

30:13.065 --> 30:17.103
I don't even know how he knew
I took it out in the first place.

30:17.105 --> 30:19.145
These things get out.

30:22.425 --> 30:24.585
This isn't just about the book.

30:25.865 --> 30:27.705
It's about you.

30:30.465 --> 30:33.185
This is about a great deal more
than just alchemy.

30:35.585 --> 30:38.423
Ashmole 782 has been missing
for centuries

30:38.425 --> 30:41.825
and yet you were able to call it up.
Aren't you curious why?

30:48.025 --> 30:50.385
You need to be careful.

31:01.985 --> 31:04.225
Professor Clairmont's rooms, please.

31:58.915 --> 32:03.715
You were right about creatures
coming to look for the book.

32:06.155 --> 32:10.993
Peter Knox from the Congregation
and there was this Scandinavian witch.

32:10.995 --> 32:13.875
I don't know...
I don't know who she was.

32:16.035 --> 32:18.793
Try to calm down.
Your adrenaline is very high.

32:18.795 --> 32:21.315
-You can smell my adrenaline?
-Course I can.

32:29.635 --> 32:30.955
Thank you.

32:36.635 --> 32:38.753
Why did you come to me?

32:38.755 --> 32:41.233
Last time I saw you, you said
you never wanted to see me again.

32:41.235 --> 32:44.115
-I have no one else to talk to.
-You must have friends.

32:46.675 --> 32:48.155
None I can trust.

32:51.795 --> 32:53.913
It was a mistake to come here.

32:53.915 --> 32:57.075
-I'm sorry I disturbed you.
-Does Knox want the book?

32:59.595 --> 33:02.513
He says it has the witches'
first spells in it.

33:02.515 --> 33:04.393
Is that what you think it is?

33:04.395 --> 33:08.153
Peter Knox believes that witches
created everything and everyone.

33:08.155 --> 33:10.115
I'm obviously not of that opinion.

33:12.395 --> 33:15.433
-Does he know that you sent it back?
-Yes.

33:15.435 --> 33:17.073
He wants me to try
and get it out again.

33:17.075 --> 33:18.955
-Will you?
-I don't want him to have it.

33:52.235 --> 33:57.955
"Dear sir, Your letter of 15th October
has reached me at last."

34:02.395 --> 34:05.753
-You knew Charles Darwin?
-Yes.

34:05.755 --> 34:08.033
I met him on a number of occasions,

34:08.034 --> 34:11.393
particularly when he was building up
to his publication of Origin.

34:11.395 --> 34:14.993
I began to wonder how his theories
might relate to us creatures.

34:14.995 --> 34:17.152
I was desperate
to understand our origins.

34:17.155 --> 34:19.993
You see, I'd already heard rumors,
whisperings,

34:19.995 --> 34:21.953
about a book

34:21.955 --> 34:24.353
hidden from human eyes,
an alchemical text.

34:24.355 --> 34:26.875
-Ashmole 782.
-Ashmole.

34:29.114 --> 34:32.993
That man had an uncanny ability
to find bizarre manuscripts.

34:32.995 --> 34:34.995
I found and read every one of them.

34:37.435 --> 34:40.072
Apart from 782.

34:40.074 --> 34:44.112
You've been searching for the book
since 1859.

34:44.114 --> 34:45.435
Mm.

34:47.435 --> 34:49.753
-How old are you?
-I'm older than I look.

34:49.755 --> 34:51.353
300 years?

34:51.355 --> 34:52.675
Mm.

34:53.554 --> 34:55.074
500 years?

34:57.715 --> 34:59.875
Did you know Machiavelli?

35:00.995 --> 35:03.915
-Survive the fall of Carthage?
-Which fall of Carthage?

35:06.595 --> 35:08.313
I'd like to show you my laboratory.

35:08.315 --> 35:11.115
The work we've been doing recently
links into creature origin.

35:12.635 --> 35:15.715
I won't harm you.
You have my word.

35:17.995 --> 35:19.315
All right.

35:22.715 --> 35:24.795
Put this on.

35:27.315 --> 35:29.515
-You're cold.
-How do you know that?

35:33.635 --> 35:36.673
Adrenalin causes a rise
in metabolic heat production.

35:36.675 --> 35:39.275
Your adrenalin has dropped
and so has your heart rate.

35:40.755 --> 35:42.755
You can hear my heart?

35:43.795 --> 35:45.115
Yes.

35:46.715 --> 35:48.515
All the time.

35:54.235 --> 35:56.593
We're among hundreds of laboratories
using genetics

35:56.595 --> 35:59.713
to study species origin,
but in our lab

35:59.715 --> 36:02.315
humans aren't the only species
we're studying.

36:03.755 --> 36:06.553
-You're studying vampire genetics?
-Mm.

36:06.555 --> 36:08.993
Witches and demons, too.

36:08.995 --> 36:12.993
We take physical specimens
from burial sites mostly

36:12.995 --> 36:15.315
and extract DNA from the samples.

36:16.475 --> 36:17.795
Hey, Matthew!

36:18.635 --> 36:20.475
He's been helping me
while you've been away.

36:21.715 --> 36:24.793
Diana, this is my colleague and
lab manager, Dr Miriam Shepherd.

36:24.795 --> 36:26.873
Miriam, this is Dr Diana Bishop.

36:26.875 --> 36:29.993
-It's a pleasure to meet you.
-And I'm Dr Marcus Whitmore.

36:29.995 --> 36:32.235
Different type of doctor.

36:35.235 --> 36:38.313
Wow!
AB negative.

36:38.315 --> 36:39.913
Don't suppose I could take
some of you blood, could I?

36:39.915 --> 36:41.793
It's tough getting a sample
from a living witch.

36:41.795 --> 36:43.313
No... thank you.

36:43.315 --> 36:46.593
If your friend isn't here to give
blood, what is she here for exactly?

36:46.595 --> 36:49.993
I wanted to show Diana that
the work we're doing here proves

36:49.995 --> 36:51.913
beyond all doubt...

36:51.915 --> 36:54.195
that creatures are dying out.

36:55.995 --> 36:58.113
Vampires are failing to sire.

36:58.115 --> 37:00.193
Demons are increasingly
prone to madness.

37:00.195 --> 37:01.515
And witches?

37:03.555 --> 37:05.315
Are losing their powers.

37:07.355 --> 37:08.795
Come and see.

37:11.755 --> 37:13.875
Please, sit down.

37:15.195 --> 37:17.635
-Allow me.
-Thank you.

37:20.715 --> 37:24.673
Now, this graph shows
the mitochondrial DNA

37:24.675 --> 37:26.553
of a witch named Benvenguda.

37:26.555 --> 37:28.473
She lived in Brittany
in the 7th century

37:28.475 --> 37:30.633
and she was very, very powerful.

37:30.635 --> 37:32.153
A marvel really,

37:32.155 --> 37:35.353
in an age that produced...
many marvels.

37:35.355 --> 37:38.993
Now, compare that to the graph
belonging to Beatrice Good,

37:38.995 --> 37:41.233
Benvenguda's last known
direct descendant.

37:41.235 --> 37:44.633
Now, as you can see, Beatrice's DNA
shows far fewer markers

37:44.635 --> 37:46.915
common amongst witches,
indicating that...

37:48.395 --> 37:52.153
her ancestors,
as the centuries passed,

37:52.155 --> 37:55.793
relied less and less upon
witchcraft to survive. Now...

37:55.795 --> 37:58.673
is this pattern of...

37:58.675 --> 38:00.993
denying power,

38:00.995 --> 38:04.115
is the reason why witches
will eventually become...

38:07.115 --> 38:08.435
extinct?

38:15.715 --> 38:18.193
-Who do you think she might talk to?
-Well, I don't know.

38:18.195 --> 38:20.755
Apart from me, Diana doesn't
have any friends in Oxford.

38:23.275 --> 38:25.313
Oh, forgive me.

38:25.315 --> 38:28.275
I don't believe you've been
introduced. This is Miss Järvinen.

38:29.515 --> 38:32.793
She's our new representative
on the Congregation.

38:32.795 --> 38:34.595
Oh. Wow!

38:35.115 --> 38:36.835
Congratulations.

38:41.715 --> 38:44.755
-Well?
-I tried to look inside her.

38:47.715 --> 38:49.475
She interests me.

38:51.955 --> 38:56.075
You think 782's going to help you
with your research, don't you?

38:57.155 --> 38:59.635
It could explain our origins, yes.

39:01.235 --> 39:04.113
But we aren't going to go
extinct tomorrow.

39:04.115 --> 39:06.635
There are still plenty of creatures
in the world.

39:08.075 --> 39:10.075
I have a different
sense of time to you.

39:11.315 --> 39:15.873
When humans talk about climate change
that's exactly the argument they use.

39:15.875 --> 39:20.675
"Oh, the polar ice caps will take
so many years to melt. Who cares?"

39:23.435 --> 39:26.675
I remember when the Thames
iced over every winter.

39:28.515 --> 39:30.715
I used to skate on it.

39:31.835 --> 39:33.953
You're right though.

39:33.955 --> 39:37.675
It's not going to happen immediately,
tomorrow, but it's already begun.

39:38.795 --> 39:41.355
One day, there'll be just one species.

39:43.155 --> 39:44.475
Humans.

39:46.155 --> 39:47.993
And at first, they won't
notice the difference

39:47.995 --> 39:50.915
because they've never noticed us,
but, gradually...

39:52.315 --> 39:54.115
eventually,
they'll come to see that...

39:55.715 --> 39:59.353
all the magic has
seeped out of the world.

39:59.355 --> 40:01.873
And they'll look around them

40:01.875 --> 40:04.075
and everyone will be the same.

40:10.115 --> 40:12.835
You think whatever power I have
I should use?

40:14.795 --> 40:18.713
I think at the very least you should
try not to be frightened of it.

40:18.715 --> 40:20.673
Although, as far as I can tell,

40:20.675 --> 40:23.313
there are only two emotions
that keep the world turning.

40:23.315 --> 40:25.993
One is...desire.

40:25.995 --> 40:28.435
And the other is fear.

40:29.995 --> 40:32.873
Magic is desire made real.

40:32.875 --> 40:35.115
-That's what my aunt says.
-Mm.

40:44.275 --> 40:47.435
The book's a palimpsest.

40:48.715 --> 40:51.235
Old words hidden under new.

40:52.395 --> 40:54.553
It was heavy.

40:54.555 --> 40:56.715
It smelt. It smelt odd.

40:58.955 --> 41:01.513
Three pages were cut out.

41:01.515 --> 41:07.633
The only page I saw showed a baby
floating in an upside-down vessel.

41:07.635 --> 41:09.673
It was probably the alchemical child,

41:09.675 --> 41:12.675
although I've never seen it
represented like that before.

41:15.315 --> 41:16.635
Thank you.

41:58.155 --> 42:00.353
I thought you knew about vampires.

42:00.355 --> 42:02.675
That's why you invited me to dinner.

42:03.435 --> 42:06.473
I need to get a book, Ashmole 782.

42:06.475 --> 42:07.835
Are you going to give the book
to the vampire?

42:08.195 --> 42:10.353
Where are we going, anyway?

42:10.355 --> 42:11.675
My house.

42:12.795 --> 42:16.713
Did you cast a spell
to call up Ashmole 782?

42:16.715 --> 42:20.073
What are you doing
hanging around with a vampire?

42:20.075 --> 42:22.353
He could feed off you,
take your memories.

42:22.355 --> 42:24.873
Seen everything you saw
when you opened up that book!

42:24.875 --> 42:27.833
Matthew de Claremont's
harassing a witch.

42:27.835 --> 42:31.313
Did your source tell you
who this witch is?

42:31.315 --> 42:32.793
Her name's Diana Bishop.

42:32.795 --> 42:36.075
You shy away from us and yet
you seek out vampire company.

42:36.435 --> 42:38.155
I'm not a bigot like you.

42:39.355 --> 42:41.675
You're craving her.

42:42.675 --> 42:44.273
What would I taste like?

42:44.275 --> 42:45.873
You wouldn't be able
to stop me if I struck

42:45.875 --> 42:47.555
and I wouldn't be able to stop myself.
