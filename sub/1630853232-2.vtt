you're 600 acres

country lines,

let me get this straight, Todd.

15:19.416 --> 15:22.875

just to go chickenshit on this

So, with the ambulance, like,
an hour away,

16:12.625 --> 16:14.666

16:14.750 --> 16:16.791
shoot the bull,
killing valuable stock

16:16.875 --> 16:18.791

a dignified death,

16:18.875 --> 16:20.791

Wayne chose the second one.
