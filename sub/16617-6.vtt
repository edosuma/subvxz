LEWIS:<i> Appears to be a totally</i>

00:21.288 --> 00:22.488
(electricity powers down)
No!

00:22.490 --> 00:23.555
Lewis.

00:23.557 --> 00:24.990
It's not me!

00:24.992 --> 00:26.625
Then who the hell did?

00:26.627 --> 00:27.659
I did!

00:27.661 --> 00:28.727
You breaking up with me?

00:28.729 --> 00:30.029
GAIL:
Melissa's not well.

00:30.031 --> 00:31.463
She needs you right now.

00:31.465 --> 00:34.633
I'm finally ready
to have a baby with you.

00:35.535 --> 00:37.202
Hey, Lewis.

00:37.204 --> 00:39.505
I wanted to apologize
for accusing you

00:39.507 --> 00:41.306
of sabotaging the building,

00:41.308 --> 00:44.676
and I thought it'd be fun
to frame that apology in a song.

00:44.678 --> 00:46.545
Sorry, Tandy,
this is not really the time.

00:46.547 --> 00:47.813
What's wrong, bud?

00:47.815 --> 00:50.582
Today would've been
my anniversary with Mark,

00:50.584 --> 00:54.353
so I'm just not in the mood
for whatever this is gonna be.

00:54.355 --> 00:56.055
Mark was your partner?

00:56.057 --> 00:57.189
Yes.

00:57.191 --> 00:58.757
Change of plans.

00:58.759 --> 01:00.826
Apology song now
a tribute-to-Mark song.

01:00.828 --> 01:02.428
So just tell me
five things about him.

01:02.430 --> 01:04.930
Actually, I-I know he's Asian,
so just four things.

01:04.932 --> 01:06.365
He's not Asian.

01:06.367 --> 01:07.766
Really?

01:07.768 --> 01:09.935
Oh.

01:09.937 --> 01:11.003
Gay though?

01:11.005 --> 01:12.538
(softly):
Yeah.

01:12.540 --> 01:14.773
Okay, so just
three more things.

01:14.775 --> 01:17.076
Come on, Lewis.
Give me the deets.

01:17.078 --> 01:20.012
He was a Pisces,

01:20.014 --> 01:22.514
we lived in Seattle,
and last time I saw him,

01:22.516 --> 01:24.216
he was boarding
a flight to Tokyo.

01:24.218 --> 01:25.284

02:13.567 --> 02:15.100
Thank you very much.

02:15.102 --> 02:17.169
That didn't help at all. Yes.

02:17.171 --> 02:18.737
Lewis.

02:20.773 --> 02:23.308
So, last time you saw him,
he was on his way to Tokyo?

02:23.310 --> 02:25.277
He went on a business trip.

02:25.279 --> 02:26.745
The virus broke out.

02:26.747 --> 02:28.413
They grounded all flights.

02:28.415 --> 02:30.849
Last I heard from him,
he was trying to charter

02:30.851 --> 02:32.918
some kind of boat
to get back here.

02:32.920 --> 02:34.319
Oh, my God, that's awesome!

02:34.321 --> 02:35.754
So he's sailing out here?

02:35.756 --> 02:37.256
That was three years ago, Tandy.

02:37.258 --> 02:39.324
So he must be getting close.

02:39.326 --> 02:41.160
Tandy, come on.

02:41.162 --> 02:42.161
What?

02:42.163 --> 02:44.029
He died.

02:44.031 --> 02:45.197
Well, maybe.

02:45.199 --> 02:47.032
I'll even go so far
as to say probably.

02:47.034 --> 02:48.500
But who knows?

03:17.565 --> 03:18.397
Oh, forgot.

03:18.399 --> 03:20.732
You can't drink right now.

03:20.734 --> 03:22.067
Yeah, funny you
should mention that.

03:22.069 --> 03:24.136
I was going through
my old baby clothes,

03:24.138 --> 03:26.738
and I realized something
that made me so sad.

03:26.740 --> 03:29.675
My baby will never
have a grandma.

03:29.677 --> 03:33.312
Or fresh food
or friends or a prom.

03:33.314 --> 03:35.814
(chuckles):
Oh, it'll have a prom.

03:35.816 --> 03:38.150
Anyways,

03:38.152 --> 03:41.353
I was just wondering
if you would ever consider

03:41.355 --> 03:43.422
being my baby's grandma.

03:43.424 --> 03:45.824
I'm not sure I'm loving
the ring of that.

03:45.826 --> 03:47.926
Well, we can come up
with another name for it.

03:47.928 --> 03:53.432
Mama Klosterman, Grammy, Gamgam,
Bubbie, Mumsy, Mimsie, Mimi,

03:53.434 --> 03:55.601
Nana, Gaga, Goo-goo, Zaza,

03:55.603 --> 03:58.704
Lala, Tata,
Jaja, Fafa,

03:58.706 --> 04:03.108
Biba, Popo, Nono, Caca, Shasha,
Nee-Nee-Nee...

04:03.110 --> 04:05.077
Are you having
some kind of a stroke?

04:05.079 --> 04:07.012
A stroke of genius.

04:07.014 --> 04:08.413
Listen.

04:08.415 --> 04:10.182
I'm not sure
I feel like

04:10.184 --> 04:12.951
being the old-ass granny
right now, so...

04:12.953 --> 04:13.952
But this...

04:13.954 --> 04:16.255
It's a no, Carol.

04:22.929 --> 04:24.296
Hey, Lewis.

04:24.298 --> 04:26.131
I like the place.

04:26.133 --> 04:27.299
Really coming
together, huh?

04:27.301 --> 04:28.700
Oh, is this Mark?

04:28.702 --> 04:29.735
Yup.

04:29.737 --> 04:32.304
TANDY:
Interesting.

04:32.306 --> 04:34.906
What do you want, Tandy?

04:34.908 --> 04:36.975
I want you to come
with me to Seattle.

04:36.977 --> 04:38.277
Why Seattle?

04:38.279 --> 04:40.045
Got a little surprise for you.

04:40.047 --> 04:42.481
Hmm. Does it have anything
to do with Mark?

04:42.483 --> 04:43.649
Maybe.

04:43.651 --> 04:45.651
Mark is dead. Now please leave.

04:45.653 --> 04:47.119
Okay, now, wait a minute.

04:47.121 --> 04:48.787
Y-You said yourself,
you never saw him die.

04:48.789 --> 04:49.788
So, who knows,

04:49.790 --> 04:51.156
huh?

04:51.158 --> 04:52.491
So, let's go. Come on.

04:52.493 --> 04:54.059
Come on, let's do it.

04:54.061 --> 04:56.962
Tandy, I'm not going
to Seattle with you.

04:56.964 --> 04:59.931
I'm afraid I insist!

04:59.933 --> 05:01.400
<i>(knock on door)</i>

05:02.335 --> 05:03.935
Hey, Lewis, I just wanted to see

05:03.937 --> 05:05.904
if you could help me out
with a very important chore.

05:05.906 --> 05:06.905
I know what you're doing.

05:06.907 --> 05:08.006
You're trying to get me
in your car

05:08.008 --> 05:09.141
so you can drive me to Seattle.

05:09.143 --> 05:11.176
No, I'm not.

05:11.178 --> 05:12.644
Swear on your baby's life.

05:12.646 --> 05:14.112
I swear on my baby's bife.

05:14.114 --> 05:15.180
What's a bife?

05:15.182 --> 05:16.481
I have a cold.

05:17.617 --> 05:19.818
Tennis with
the Williams sisters' rackets?

05:19.820 --> 05:21.186
Oh, come on!

05:21.188 --> 05:24.856
Uh, could you help me, uh,
reattach my eyebrows out here?

05:24.858 --> 05:26.992
Gardening, anyone?

05:26.994 --> 05:28.860
I'm not going to Seattle.
Seattle? What?!

05:28.862 --> 05:30.362
I'm not-- Okay.

05:30.364 --> 05:32.030
<i>(knock on door)</i>

05:32.032 --> 05:34.199
Tandy, I am not
going to Seattle!

05:34.201 --> 05:35.534
I know.

05:35.536 --> 05:37.202
I-I just wanted to say
I'm sorry.

05:37.204 --> 05:38.537
You know, I thought

05:38.539 --> 05:41.106
I would be helping,
but I was doing it more for me

05:41.108 --> 05:42.341
than I was for you.

05:42.343 --> 05:43.875
It was so selfish.

05:43.877 --> 05:45.177
So...

05:45.179 --> 05:48.180
anyway, I got you a little
anniversary present.

05:49.782 --> 05:51.216
Used the bad wrap job.

05:51.218 --> 05:52.851
(Taser crackling,
Lewis groaning)

05:52.853 --> 05:54.386
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.

05:54.388 --> 05:56.321
This is gonna be really
good for you, though.

05:56.323 --> 05:57.889
TANDY:
So sorry.

05:57.891 --> 05:59.591
(grunts)

06:00.360 --> 06:01.393
(engine starts)

06:01.395 --> 06:03.428
(siren wailing)

06:07.967 --> 06:10.235
What possible reason do you have
for taking me to Seattle?

06:10.237 --> 06:12.037
Mark is not gonna be there!

06:12.039 --> 06:13.672
Well, he may not be there now,

06:13.674 --> 06:15.741
but what if he comes back
in the future, huh?

06:15.743 --> 06:18.310
I mean, he needs to know
where we are, and that is why

06:18.312 --> 06:19.978
we're gonna leave him a note
with our address.

06:19.980 --> 06:21.413
Mark is dead, Tandy!

06:21.415 --> 06:23.081
Well, my brother
was dead, too.

06:23.083 --> 06:24.182
He was up in space.

06:24.184 --> 06:26.718
Not Tokyo,
but friggin' outer space.

06:26.720 --> 06:29.421
And then somehow,
my dead brother managed

06:29.423 --> 06:32.758
to make it to Earth
and find me in Malibu, alive.

06:32.760 --> 06:35.026
Now, if a miracle
could happen for me,

06:35.028 --> 06:36.895
why can't it happen for you?

06:36.897 --> 06:38.930
Because it can't, okay?

06:40.833 --> 06:43.268
You know, I know why
you get short with me.

06:43.270 --> 06:46.037
(sighs) Must be so hard for you
to have to look at me

06:46.039 --> 06:48.740
all the time and be reminded
of him every step of the way.

06:48.742 --> 06:50.108
Reminded of who?

06:50.110 --> 06:52.177
I think you know.

06:54.847 --> 06:56.848
Kind of feel like masturbating.
(chuckles)

06:56.850 --> 06:58.049
In what way

06:58.051 --> 07:00.619
do you think you look like Mark?

07:00.621 --> 07:02.354
In what way do I not?

07:02.356 --> 07:06.057
Bone structure, you know,
uh, playfulness of the cheeks,

07:06.059 --> 07:09.561
uh, come hither eyes,
uh, pouty lips.

07:09.563 --> 07:12.030
There is not one similarity.

07:12.032 --> 07:14.032
That's what you should
keep telling yourself.

07:19.238 --> 07:20.939
Nice miss.

07:20.941 --> 07:22.641
Hello, lady friends.

07:22.643 --> 07:24.242
So, Gail.

07:24.244 --> 07:25.577
Yeah?
You're worried that

07:25.579 --> 07:29.481
once a baby calls you Grandma,
you cease to be attractive.

07:29.483 --> 07:30.715
Not so.

07:30.717 --> 07:32.884
I made some drawings
to illustrate my point.

07:32.886 --> 07:35.654
I call it "Grannies That You
Want to Get in Their Panties."

07:35.656 --> 07:37.489
(chuckles):
Okay.

07:37.491 --> 07:40.325
Check out these
fine-lookin' memaws.

07:40.327 --> 07:41.827
Ooh.

07:41.829 --> 07:43.462
Goldie Hawn.

07:43.464 --> 07:45.330
I bet she goes<i> overboard</i>

07:45.332 --> 07:47.432
showering her grandkids
with gifts.

07:47.434 --> 07:49.668
She was in the movie<i> Overboard.</i>

07:49.670 --> 07:51.069
Yeah, I got...
I got it.

07:51.071 --> 07:52.504
Beyoncé's mom.

07:52.506 --> 07:53.939
Who runs the world?

07:53.941 --> 07:55.807
Grandmas.

07:55.809 --> 07:57.609
Kris and Caitlyn Jenner.

07:57.611 --> 07:59.678
Double granny whammy there.

07:59.680 --> 08:00.979
And look at this.

08:00.981 --> 08:03.215
There's you, Gail.
(gasps softly)

08:04.250 --> 08:05.684
Wow, wow.

08:05.686 --> 08:09.120
Okay, now,
chapter two: Homely Lonelys.

08:09.122 --> 08:11.490
These are plain women
who don't have grandkids.

08:11.492 --> 08:12.624
See?

08:12.626 --> 08:14.092
Oh, geez!

08:14.094 --> 08:16.528
Okay, Carol, okay, good.

08:16.530 --> 08:19.598
Fine. Your kid can call me
Grandma or Memaw

08:19.600 --> 08:21.132
or whatever the hell you want.

08:21.134 --> 08:23.835
Just let me get back
to my cornhole.

08:23.837 --> 08:25.937
This is the best news.
Thank you so much!

08:25.939 --> 08:27.172
Throwing.
Okay.

08:28.140 --> 08:30.375
Yellow! Whoo!

08:30.377 --> 08:31.510
TANDY:
<i>We're getting close.</i>

08:31.512 --> 08:32.978
LEWIS:
<i>Tandy, this is ridiculous!</i>

08:32.980 --> 08:35.680
Please take that bag
off of your head.

08:35.682 --> 08:38.283
No can do, bud. I can't
let you fall in love with me.

08:38.285 --> 08:39.718
I got too much respect for Mark.

about leaving a note.

11:54.080 --> 11:56.214
I was gonna kill myself.

11:56.216 --> 11:59.350
I was just gonna

11:59.352 --> 12:02.654
And I don't know why,
but I looked up

12:02.656 --> 12:05.757
and I saw this
plume of smoke,

12:05.759 --> 12:08.693
and it was Carol.

12:08.695 --> 12:10.929
And she saved me.

12:10.931 --> 12:13.665
And the only reason that
Carol showed up there

12:13.667 --> 12:15.366
was 'cause of those signs.

12:15.368 --> 12:18.269
Those "Alive in
Tucson" signs.

12:18.271 --> 12:21.906
Signs that I was positive
nobody would ever see.

12:23.876 --> 12:25.877
