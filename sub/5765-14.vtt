WEBVTT

00:02.800 --> 00:04.597
MAN:
How many telephones are there?

00:04.630 --> 00:05.699
ALICIA:
Two.

00:05.730 --> 00:07.436
MAN:
And that's the only exit?

00:07.470 --> 00:08.698
ALICIA:
Yes.

00:08.740 --> 00:10.367
MAN:
And there's no contraband
in the apartment?

00:10.410 --> 00:12.037
That's correct.

00:12.080 --> 00:13.308
Any firearms?

00:13.340 --> 00:15.228
Nope.

00:15.280 --> 00:17.771
Any other weapons
of any kind?

00:17.810 --> 00:19.641
Well, knives.
Do they count?

00:19.680 --> 00:21.113
Can I see them, please?

00:22.490 --> 00:24.742
No, that's fine.

00:24.790 --> 00:27.111
And which room would
your husband inhabit?

00:36.670 --> 00:39.559
So, if the judge

00:39.600 --> 00:42.330
approves electronic monitoring,

00:42.370 --> 00:44.804
I'll need a small space by
the front door for the receiver.

00:44.840 --> 00:45.807
Do you have Wi-Fi?

00:45.840 --> 00:47.205
Yes.
I'll have
to test It

00:47.240 --> 00:49.447
to make sure
there's no Interference.

00:49.480 --> 00:52.847
Now... I have to ask_
your children some questions,

00:52.880 --> 00:53.812
if you don't mind.

00:53.850 --> 00:55.374
What kind of questions?

00:55.420 --> 00:57.308
Eh, nothing invasive.

00:57.350 --> 00:58.817
Same questions
I asked you.

00:58.850 --> 01:00.386
Please.

01:01.860 --> 01:03.225
Zach, Grace.

01:03.260 --> 01:05.251
Yeah?

01:06.860 --> 01:09.795
Do either of you have
contraband in your rooms?

01:09.830 --> 01:11.695
GRACE:
No.
Any firearms?

01:11.730 --> 01:12.697
No.

01:12.740 --> 01:14.162
Any other weapons?

01:14.200 --> 01:15.167
No.

01:15.200 --> 01:16.303
Great. That should do it.

01:16.340 --> 01:18.228
(phone rings)

01:18.270 --> 01:19.532
Excuse me, Sheriff.

01:19.580 --> 01:20.706
Hello.

01:20.740 --> 01:22.105
DIANE:
Hi, Alicia, it's Diane.

01:22.150 --> 01:23.879
We need you right away.

01:23.910 --> 01:24.706
Now?

01:24.750 --> 01:27.241
Yes, I'm sorry,
it's very important.

01:27.280 --> 01:28.713
And can you bring a few things?

01:28.750 --> 01:32.550
Toiletries, clothing
for 48 hours, and a man's tie.

01:32.590 --> 01:34.455
(elevator bell dings)

01:34.490 --> 01:37.129
Sonya, I'm so sorry.
(sobbing)

01:37.160 --> 01:40.254
Shh. Oh, oh.

01:42.230 --> 01:44.266
What is it about?

01:44.300 --> 01:45.392
I don't know.

01:45.430 --> 01:46.863
I'll call you
as soon as I find out.

01:48.170 --> 01:49.330
Will you be all right?
Oh, yes,

01:49.370 --> 01:50.735
we'll be fine.

01:50.770 --> 01:51.737
_ Mrs. Kelzi_ck
IS downstairs--

01:51.770 --> 01:53.306
a phone call away.

01:53.340 --> 01:55.672
Is Peter really coming home?

01:55.710 --> 01:57.871
I don't know.

01:57.910 --> 01:59.810
They do this to prepare.

01:59.850 --> 02:02.318
We'll see.

02:02.350 --> 02:05.911
CARY:
So, does your face turn into,
like, a cow's head or something?

02:05.950 --> 02:08.555
You never did mushrooms
in the Peace Corps?

02:08.590 --> 02:10.558
Hey, I was
with the good kids.

02:10.590 --> 02:12.558
(laughs)

02:12.600 --> 02:15.728
So when is something
supposed to happen?

02:15.760 --> 02:17.625
About an hour.

02:17.670 --> 02:20.639
(phone ringing)

02:20.670 --> 02:25.164
No. No...

02:25.210 --> 02:28.532
Cary, I know you were supposed
to have tomorrow off,

02:28.580 --> 02:29.774
but we need you in now.

02:29.810 --> 02:32.313
Um... what?

02:32.350 --> 02:34.272
* Cary's high
on mushrooms *

02:34.320 --> 02:35.776
Why, what...?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, okay, okay.

02:35.820 --> 02:36.787
(snaps fingers)

02:36.820 --> 02:37.741
Collecting the troops.

02:37.790 --> 02:39.951
Put everything on hold
for 48 hours, okay?

02:39.990 --> 02:42.959
Um...
* Mushroom's
high on Cary *

02:42.990 --> 02:45.356
* Cary's high
on mushrooms. *

02:45.390 --> 02:46.698
Hey.

02:46.730 --> 02:47.856
(dialing phone)

02:47.900 --> 02:49.868
You there?

02:49.900 --> 02:51.265
I just got here.

02:51.300 --> 02:52.289
What do you know?

02:52.340 --> 02:54.228
Diane's with the wife now.

02:54.270 --> 02:55.589
How bad does it look?

02:56.740 --> 02:58.708
(indistinct conversations)

02:58.740 --> 02:59.707
Bad.

02:59.740 --> 03:02.300
See what you can do, okay?

03:02.350 --> 03:04.807
Hey, Kalinda, what
you doing here?

03:04.850 --> 03:06.249
I just got a deposition
get canceled.

03:06.280 --> 03:07.247
I saw your lights.

03:07.280 --> 03:08.247
What's up?

03:08.280 --> 03:09.679
Homicide in the suburbs.

03:09.720 --> 03:11.210
Better than Cirque du Soleil.

03:11.250 --> 03:12.353
Who is it?

03:12.390 --> 03:14.688
Female, no ID,
looks about 20.

03:14.720 --> 03:16.859
Security guard says
it's the babysitter.

03:16.890 --> 03:18.289
What is it,
burglary gone wrong?

03:18.330 --> 03:20.218
(chuckles)

03:20.260 --> 03:22.569
Come on, it's making
me nostalgic.

03:22.600 --> 03:25.694
I got a police scanner at
home to keep me company.

03:25.730 --> 03:27.368
Hey, K, what's up?

03:27.400 --> 03:28.367
Hi, Tony.

03:28.400 --> 03:30.903
Just wanted to see the
professronals at work.

03:30.940 --> 03:32.339
Civilians aren't welcome.

03:32.380 --> 03:33.335
What?

03:33.380 --> 03:34.199
Come on, Lou,
she's a friendly.

03:34.240 --> 03:36.674
She scratches our back,
we scratch hers.

03:38.680 --> 03:41.808
All right, I've got
the security guard in here.

03:41.850 --> 03:44.410
The kids were fine; she took
them to their grandparents.

03:44.450 --> 03:46.486
I said that she should wait
for you guys here,

03:46.520 --> 03:48.556
that you'd want to talk
to her and Mr. Rucker.

03:48.590 --> 03:49.818
Mr. Rucker was with her?

03:49.860 --> 03:51.350
No, it was just her.
I don't see

03:51.390 --> 03:52.152
the babysitter's car.

03:52.190 --> 03:53.350
Who picks her up
and drops her off?

03:53.400 --> 03:55.857
Mr. Rucker.
Husband?

03:55.900 --> 03:57.891
Yeah.
He's like a stay-
at-home dad, right?

03:57.930 --> 03:59.898
Yeah-- yes, sir.

03:59.940 --> 04:00.895
He just lost his job.

04:00.940 --> 04:02.259
He's out of work.

04:02.310 --> 04:04.266
Do you know where
Mr. Rucker is now?

04:04.310 --> 04:06.835
At the movies.

04:06.880 --> 04:08.507
We get a babysitter
on Thursday evenings

04:08.540 --> 04:10.440
so my husband can
take the night off.

04:10.480 --> 04:12.311
Otherwise he's
home all day.

04:12.350 --> 04:13.977
Have you been in touch
with Jason yet?

04:14.020 --> 04:17.012
No, no. 1-1 mean,
I've been trying his cell.

04:17.050 --> 04:18.608
Okay.

04:18.650 --> 04:20.515
Could you write down
his number?

04:20.560 --> 04:21.811
(phone vibrates)

04:26.400 --> 04:27.594
You don't think
they'll think Jason...?

04:27.630 --> 04:28.790
We have to prepare
for everything.

04:36.540 --> 04:38.508
(line rings)

04:38.540 --> 04:39.768
Hi, you've reached Jason Rucker.

04:39.810 --> 04:41.038
Please leave a message.

04:41.080 --> 04:42.502
Mr. Rucker,
this is Will Gardner.

04:42.550 --> 04:43.949
I'm a partner at the law firm

04:43.980 --> 04:45.072
that represents
your wife's company.

04:45.110 --> 04:47.044
When you get this message,
would you give me a call?

04:47.080 --> 04:48.308
It's extremely important.

04:48.350 --> 04:50.079
Struggle here...

04:50.120 --> 04:51.439
here.

04:51.490 --> 04:53.481
Blood spray. Crenellated.

04:53.520 --> 04:55.408
More struggle, more
defensive spray.

04:55.460 --> 04:57.849
Handprint on the wall.

05:01.130 --> 05:03.690
What's this?

05:03.730 --> 05:06.836
Looks like the
rubber nub from under

05:06.870 --> 05:09.088
a computer.

05:09.140 --> 05:11.961
Just a guess.

05:14.980 --> 05:16.709
LOU:
Oh, boy.

05:16.750 --> 05:18.047
Is that the babysitter?

05:19.580 --> 05:22.071
Lisa Pruitt.

05:22.120 --> 05:25.442
I-I found...

05:25.490 --> 05:26.787
She was in my bathroom.

05:26.820 --> 05:29.015
I'm sorry to ask this,
Sonya,

05:29.060 --> 05:30.948
but our investigator
on the scene is saying

05:30.990 --> 05:32.423
there was marijuana.

05:32.460 --> 05:33.654
Did Jason
smoke pot?

05:33.700 --> 05:35.793
No.

05:35.830 --> 05:37.821
In college.

05:37.870 --> 05:39.064
Why?

05:44.740 --> 05:47.072
Sorry, you're...?

05:48.480 --> 05:49.777
You get that a lot?

05:49.810 --> 05:51.846
Less so.
Sorry, I'm a
news junkie.

05:51.880 --> 05:55.077
Your husband-- I heard
he's getting out.

05:55.120 --> 05:56.439
Oh, I don't know.

05:56.490 --> 05:57.741
It changes day to day.

05:57.790 --> 05:58.916
I hope he does.

05:58.950 --> 06:01.054
Thank you.
(elevator bell dings)

06:01.090 --> 06:02.421
MAN:
Which floor?

06:02.460 --> 06:04.553
Oh, you just
pressed it.

06:04.590 --> 06:05.989
Oh, you work
at Stern, Lockhart.

06:06.030 --> 06:08.021
Maybe you know
what this is all about.

06:08.060 --> 06:09.561
Something about
my wife's company?

06:09.600 --> 06:11.795
Sorry. Junior associate--
I'm the last to know.

06:14.040 --> 06:15.689
(elevator bell dings)
If there's anything,
you just...

06:16.740 --> 06:18.958
Jason.

06:19.010 --> 06:20.807
(sobbing)

06:20.840 --> 06:22.705
What's wrong?

06:22.750 --> 06:24.672
What happened?

06:24.710 --> 06:28.009
Mr. Rucker,
do you have a second?

06:29.180 --> 06:30.886
It's not a knife.

06:30.920 --> 06:32.649
Those aren't deep enough
for knife wounds.

06:32.690 --> 06:34.578
Looks like a blunt instrument.

06:34.620 --> 06:35.882
Maybe it's something
from the bedroom.

06:35.920 --> 06:38.957
Check the fireplace poker
downstairs.

06:38.990 --> 06:40.423
It's missing.

06:40.460 --> 06:42.519
But I just saw her.
You just saw her--

06:42.570 --> 06:43.525
the babysitter--

06:43.570 --> 06:44.628
when you picked her up?
Yes.

06:44.670 --> 06:45.796
I picked her
up at her dorm,

06:45.830 --> 06:47.889
and I drove her to...

06:47.940 --> 06:49.828
I'm in trouble?

06:49.870 --> 06:51.462
I'm the last one that saw her.

06:51.510 --> 06:52.738
They'll suspect me?
Yes.

06:52.780 --> 06:54.532
Oh, my God.

06:54.580 --> 06:55.672
Then why...?

06:55.710 --> 06:57.041
I need to go to the
police, don't I?

06:57.080 --> 06:58.479
_ WILL:
I just spoke to them.

06:58.510 --> 06:59.818
I agreed to surrender
you in the morning,

06:59.850 --> 07:00.919
but these first few hours

07:00.950 --> 07:04.545
of an investigation are
always the most important.

07:04.590 --> 07:06.080
Anything can be
misinterpreted.

07:06.120 --> 07:07.712
JASON:
Won't my coming here
be misinterpreted?

07:07.760 --> 07:09.955
Unfortunately, it's a risk
we're going to have to take.

07:09.990 --> 07:11.150
This early
in an investigation,

07:11.190 --> 07:12.657
it's all about leverage,

07:12.700 --> 07:14.122
and you have the right
to remain silent,

07:14.160 --> 07:14.922
so our leverage is

07:14.960 --> 07:17.099
how much access
we allow the police.

07:17.130 --> 07:19.564
They want more,
we want less,

07:19.600 --> 07:21.636
so we're the gatekeepers to you.

07:21.670 --> 07:22.864
CARY:
Yep.

07:25.710 --> 07:27.177
We're going to have you take

07:27.210 --> 07:28.700
a polygraph,
Mr. Rucker.

07:28.740 --> 07:29.707
It's not
about truth

07:29.750 --> 07:32.173
or innocence.

07:32.210 --> 07:33.768
I'm sorry, a lie detector test?

07:33.820 --> 07:35.640
Yes, I need
information

07:35.680 --> 07:36.783
so I know how much
to let you talk

07:36.820 --> 07:39.653
(phone ringing)
versus how much
to keep you silent.

07:40.660 --> 07:41.649
Yeah?

07:45.190 --> 07:46.555
(siren wailing)
They're on their way to you now.

07:46.600 --> 07:47.794
They're not going
to wait till tomorrow.

07:47.830 --> 07:48.854
How long?

07:51.730 --> 07:53.789
You have 15 minutes.

07:55.700 --> 07:57.600
I'm going to start
hooking you up.

07:58.770 --> 08:01.079
Thank you.

08:01.110 --> 08:03.704
(siren wailing)

08:03.750 --> 08:05.047
WILL:
In about five minutes

08:05.080 --> 08:06.911
the police are going to burst
through those doors.

08:06.950 --> 08:08.941
I need you to be on
for the next 48 hours.

08:08.980 --> 08:10.117
That's how long they have

08:10.150 --> 08:11.640
to charge him with murder
or release him.

08:11.690 --> 08:13.749
It's now going to be
the most crucial 48 hours

08:13.790 --> 08:15.678
of his life.

08:15.720 --> 08:17.119
If they charge him,
bail's a long shot

08:17.160 --> 08:18.559
and he could spend
a year in prison

08:18.590 --> 08:19.750
before he comes
to trIal.

08:19.800 --> 08:21.620
Even_ if he's found
Innocent,

08:21.660 --> 08:24.163
that's a year of his life gone,

08:24.200 --> 08:26.225
so these 48 hours are gonna
be like a mini-trial.

08:26.270 --> 08:28.090
We're gonna get the cops
to look somewhere else

08:28.140 --> 08:29.630
and get him released.

08:29.670 --> 08:31.763
Okay?
I rode up
in the elevator with him.

08:31.810 --> 08:34.176
Either he's the best actor
in the world

08:34.210 --> 08:35.609
or he had no idea
this happened.

08:35.640 --> 08:36.868
Okay, good, it'd be nice
if he was innocent.

08:36.910 --> 08:37.899
It's a better hand.

08:39.750 --> 08:41.115
Come on, I thought
we had an agreement.

08:41.150 --> 08:43.789
TONY: Jason Rucker.
JASON: Yes?

08:43.820 --> 08:46.084
Mr. Rucker, you are under arrest
for the murder of Lisa Pruitt.

08:46.120 --> 08:47.815
You have the right
to remain silent.

08:47.860 --> 08:49.782
Anything you say
can and will be used against you

08:49.830 --> 08:50.751
in a court of law.

08:50.790 --> 08:51.586
Easy, easy.

08:51.630 --> 08:53.552
You have the right
to an attorney.

08:53.600 --> 08:54.794
If you can't afford
an attorney,
SONYA:
Jason! Jason!

08:54.830 --> 08:56.127
one will be
appointed...
JASON: Sonya!

08:56.160 --> 08:58.196
Ma'am, no,
you need to step back.

08:59.230 --> 09:03.200
Okay, here we go-- 48 hours.

09:06.310 --> 09:10.246
Captioning sponsored by
CBS TELEVISION

09:21.360 --> 09:24.158
The panic alarm was triggered
from inside?

09:24.190 --> 09:26.658
Yeah--
yes, ma'am.

09:26.700 --> 09:28.656
So the alarm wasn't triggered
from someone breaking in.

09:28.700 --> 09:30.918
It was triggered
from someone already in?

09:30.970 --> 09:33.165
Yeah, that's why they're
thinking the husband did it--

09:33.200 --> 09:35.339
because he could
disarm the system.

09:37.640 --> 09:40.700
And who else can disarm
the system?

09:41.680 --> 09:43.341
Hmm?
Huh?

09:43.380 --> 09:44.347
Who else,

09:44.380 --> 09:46.007
uh, besides
Mr. Rucker?

09:46.050 --> 09:47.347
Yes, Mr. Horner.

09:47.380 --> 09:50.315
Well, uh, housekeeper

09:50.350 --> 09:52.386
and Lisa the
babysitter.

09:52.420 --> 09:54.081
Miss Pruitt?
Yeah.

09:54.120 --> 09:56.088
What?

09:56.120 --> 09:57.280
You said "Lisa."

09:57.330 --> 09:58.683
Yeah, Lisa Pruitt. Why?

09:58.730 --> 09:59.856
What's the housekeeper's name?

09:59.900 --> 10:01.925
I don't know.

10:01.960 --> 10:03.325
But you know Lisa's.

10:03.370 --> 10:04.962
I try to be observant.

10:05.000 --> 10:07.139
Hmm, selectively observant.

10:07.170 --> 10:09.968
You can also disarm
the alarm system.

10:10.010 --> 10:11.363
It's not just
the housekeeper

10:11.410 --> 10:13.628
and Lisa the babysitter, is it?

10:13.680 --> 10:15.375
I don't think I want to answer
any more of your questions.

10:15.410 --> 10:16.377
You don't need
to answer

10:16.410 --> 10:17.843
any more of her questions.

10:21.250 --> 10:24.117
So... did you find
the murder weapon?

10:24.150 --> 10:25.185
The poker?

10:25.220 --> 10:26.289
Yeah, it's right
outside the door,

10:26.320 --> 10:27.651
right where the
husband dropped it.

10:27.690 --> 10:28.816
The husband?
Yeah.

10:28.860 --> 10:31.727
Really? And how does
that play, Tony?

10:31.760 --> 10:32.727
He lets
himself in,

10:32.760 --> 10:35.797
tries to rape her, she
resists, he kills her.

10:35.830 --> 10:36.922
_ Steals the
mIssmg red purse,

10:36.970 --> 10:38.369
triggers the alarm
on the way out,

10:38.400 --> 10:39.867
make it look
like a burglary.

10:39.900 --> 10:41.731
See, I'm liking
the security guard.

10:41.770 --> 10:43.362
Oh, you're such an
unbiased observer.

10:43.410 --> 10:44.866
Guard sees the babysitter,

10:44.910 --> 10:47.936
wants her, lets himself in,
disarms the code,

10:47.980 --> 10:49.402
tries to rape her,
she resists,

10:49.440 --> 10:50.839
then steals
her pretty red purse,

10:50.880 --> 10:52.177
triggers the alarm
on the way out

10:52.210 --> 10:54.269
to make it look
like a burglary.

10:54.320 --> 10:56.686
Husband lost his job as a
cartoonist two months ago.

10:56.720 --> 10:58.312
Now he's sitting at
home playing Mr. Mom

10:58.350 --> 11:00.750
while wifey's out making
an Internet fortune.

11:00.790 --> 11:02.849
That hubby needs to
reassert his manhood.

11:02.890 --> 11:05.051
Hey, listen, I'm all

11:05.090 --> 11:07.752
for dime store psychoanalysis
if it helps me close a case.

11:07.800 --> 11:08.721
(laughs)

11:08.760 --> 11:10.921
Just keep an open mind
for the security guard.

11:10.970 --> 11:13.689
My mind is as open as
a field of poppies.

11:17.770 --> 11:19.772
(laughing)

11:24.310 --> 11:26.449
You look, um... content.

11:26.480 --> 11:28.345
You know, sometimes
the fog dissipates,

11:28.380 --> 11:31.884
the rain disappears, and
everything makes sense.

11:31.920 --> 11:33.854
Uh-huh. You've made
a decision?
I have.

11:33.890 --> 11:35.881
Alicia around?
Uh, no.

11:36.930 --> 11:38.454
Peter.

11:38.490 --> 11:39.752
Glenn.

11:39.800 --> 11:41.199
So, you know the
offer you made?

11:41.230 --> 11:42.458
What offer would that be?

11:42.500 --> 11:45.060
Freedom today
if I don't fight the conviction,

11:45.100 --> 11:47.261
stay disbarred, can't run again.

11:47.300 --> 11:49.461
Yes, that offer. Smart move
would bﬁ to take it.
m.

11:49.500 --> 11:52.207
So I have to imagine you're
going to tell me to go to hell.

11:52.240 --> 11:54.276
You want _the
longer ver5|on?
Can't wait.

11:54.310 --> 11:56.949
I wouldn't get too comfortable
in that office of yours.

12:00.320 --> 12:02.311
I'm gonna testify.

12:02.350 --> 12:05.808
Would it help if I told you
that that's a mistake?

12:05.850 --> 12:08.489
Look, ifI end up
in a 12 by 12 cell

12:08.520 --> 12:10.056
for the next nine years,

12:10.090 --> 12:11.955
I just want to know that
I did everything I could.

12:13.500 --> 12:14.797
Will you call
Alicia for me?

12:14.830 --> 12:16.889
Mm.

12:16.930 --> 12:19.296
JASON:
I liked her.

12:19.330 --> 12:20.968
I wouldn't
hurt her.

12:21.000 --> 12:22.934
So, you were
at the movies?
Yes.

12:22.970 --> 12:24.506
Legend of Condor Hero.
It's a wuxia movie.

12:24.540 --> 12:25.859
A...?

12:25.910 --> 12:27.036
Wuxia?

12:27.080 --> 12:28.274
Wire fu.

12:28.310 --> 12:30.005
Chinese flying.

12:30.050 --> 12:32.006
Oh, like Crouching Tiger?

12:33.520 --> 12:35.511
Sorry.
They play them
every Thursday night

12:35.550 --> 12:37.780
at Armour Square, Chinatown.

12:37.820 --> 12:38.548
And you have the ticket stub?

12:38.590 --> 12:41.514
No, I threw it away.

12:41.560 --> 12:42.879
You... ?

12:42.930 --> 12:44.784
Okay, so we're gonna have
to find someone

12:44.830 --> 12:45.558
who saw you there.

12:45.590 --> 12:47.899
CARY: _
WUXIa, WUXla.

12:50.600 --> 12:53.489
Cary, can I talk
to you for a second?

12:53.540 --> 12:55.030
Are you on something?

12:55.070 --> 12:56.799
CARY:
No.

12:56.840 --> 12:59.001
I like you, Alicia.

12:59.040 --> 13:00.905
I like you, too, Cary.

13:00.940 --> 13:03.079
I need you to pull
it together now.

13:03.110 --> 13:04.270
Okay.

13:04.310 --> 13:06.141
Okay, here we go. Pulling.

13:06.180 --> 13:08.273
WILL:
What I don't understand is why
are we hearing about this now?

13:08.320 --> 13:10.379
I showed you
his lie detector test.

13:10.420 --> 13:12.047
A partial test
you conducted.

13:12.090 --> 13:13.955
By a top FBI polygraphist,

13:13.990 --> 13:15.878
and he was passing
with flying colors.

13:15.920 --> 13:16.921
Then let me question him.

13:16.960 --> 13:19.895
With conditions.
I could charge
him right now.

13:19.930 --> 13:20.919
Then do it.

13:20.960 --> 13:22.825
What's stopping you?

13:24.470 --> 13:26.563
You don't have enough.

13:26.600 --> 13:29.967
I want two of my lawyers
to stay with him at all times.

13:30.010 --> 13:31.159
They have the freedom

13:31.210 --> 13:33.007
to consult him
with the camera off.

13:33.040 --> 13:34.905
And I want 15-minute breaks
every hour.

13:35.940 --> 13:37.942
No food?

13:41.020 --> 13:43.215
Pizza.

13:43.250 --> 13:44.911
In one hour.

13:44.950 --> 13:46.542
He is a little creepy.

13:46.590 --> 13:48.581
Walks around like
he's saving the neighborhood.

13:48.620 --> 13:50.884
You know what?

13:50.930 --> 13:54.388
We had a break-in right after
he started six months ago.

13:54.430 --> 13:56.398
Really? What did they take?
That's the thing.

13:56.430 --> 13:58.421
Just some money from our bureau,

13:58.470 --> 14:01.291
some clothes from my closet
and Popsicles.

14:01.340 --> 14:02.568
Popsicles?

14:02.600 --> 14:03.965
Yeah.

14:04.010 --> 14:05.432
I think he did it

14:05.470 --> 14:08.303
just so he could come
and take a report, you know?

14:08.340 --> 14:10.649
Same thing with three other
houses in the neighborhood.

14:10.680 --> 14:12.944
It's just creepy.

14:16.420 --> 14:17.944
LOU:
Then what did you do?

14:17.990 --> 14:19.514
Well, I dropped her
at the house.

14:19.550 --> 14:21.313
I made sure
she had my cell number,

14:21.360 --> 14:22.657
then I went to the movies.

14:22.690 --> 14:24.885
Did you see the security guard
anywhere near the house?

14:24.930 --> 14:26.249
JASON:
The guard? Sure.
He's always around.

14:26.290 --> 14:28.258
WILL:
You seen him around much
when you dropped off

14:28.300 --> 14:30.222
Lisa Pruitt?
I guess.

14:30.270 --> 14:32.522
Yes, thank you, Mr. Gardner.

14:32.570 --> 14:34.561
We're following
aHIeads.

14:34.600 --> 14:35.931
Really?
Yes.

14:35.970 --> 14:36.834
Because I know

14:36.870 --> 14:38.599
you have an unoccupied
interrogation room.

14:42.010 --> 14:44.979
GOLDEN:
So, very simply, you're in jail
now because you DP'd cases,

14:45.010 --> 14:46.102
is that right?
It is.

14:46.150 --> 14:47.378
Could you explain?

14:47.420 --> 14:49.308
Well, DP means
declining to prosecute.

14:49.350 --> 14:53.684
And what cases did you
decline to prosecute?

14:53.720 --> 14:55.984
Uh, investigations

14:56.020 --> 14:58.420
into allegedly corrupt
real estate practices.

14:58.460 --> 14:59.529
What was happening is

14:59.560 --> 15:01.994
that speculators were
buying depressed properties

15:02.030 --> 15:04.692
on the land near where Olympic
stadiums were to be built.

15:04.730 --> 15:06.698
Why did you stop
these investigations?

15:06.730 --> 15:07.628
They sound promising.

15:07.670 --> 15:11.003
For a very simple reason--
Lashkar-eTaiba,

15:11.040 --> 15:12.701
which is a jihadist
extremist group

15:12.740 --> 15:15.038
believed to be active
in Chicago,

15:15.080 --> 15:18.447
allegedly involved in
last year's attacks in Mumbai.

15:18.480 --> 15:21.415
And the fact of the matter is,
is I pulled these investigators

15:21.450 --> 15:23.338
from these other cases
because I believed

15:23.390 --> 15:25.688
that the pursuit of these
extremists was more important.

15:25.720 --> 15:27.483
In fact, there was an arrest
in October?

15:27.520 --> 15:28.657
That's correct.

15:28.690 --> 15:30.226
That would be
David Coleman Headley,

15:30.260 --> 15:32.319
allegedly a key member of LeT.

15:32.360 --> 15:34.328
So...

15:34.360 --> 15:37.420
why didn't you testify
to all of this at your trial?

15:40.600 --> 15:42.568
I should have.

15:42.600 --> 15:45.034
But there_ was _
a larger consnderatlon.

15:46.240 --> 15:49.539
A failing in my personal life
was being used against me.

15:49.580 --> 15:53.038
I wanted to protect my family
against further hurt.

15:53.080 --> 15:55.548
I knew that I couldn't testify

15:55.580 --> 15:58.481
about these false
corruption charges unless I was

15:58.520 --> 16:00.488
then willing to testify about...

16:00.520 --> 16:02.511
my life.

16:02.560 --> 16:04.187
Thank you, Mr. Florrick.

16:04.230 --> 16:05.379
Mr. Landry, your witness.

16:05.430 --> 16:07.648
Actually, my witness,
Your Honor.

16:07.700 --> 16:10.168
Um, Your Honor? Objection.

16:10.200 --> 16:12.168
On what grounds?
Mr. Childs,
you're not

16:12.200 --> 16:13.758
the judge here.
Apologies,
Your Honor.

16:13.800 --> 16:16.291
Uh, Mr. Childs is instrumental

16:16.340 --> 16:19.002
in the matters directly under
consideration here, Your Honor.

16:19.040 --> 16:20.405
Those are the grounds.

16:20.440 --> 16:22.704
But Mr. Florr_ick is such
a great AmerIcan hero...

16:22.740 --> 16:24.139
Your Honor.

16:24.180 --> 16:25.306
...and has been instrumental

16:25.350 --> 16:27.147
in the defense
of our great nation.

16:27.180 --> 16:28.340
Your Honor!

16:28.380 --> 16:30.382
Surely he wouldn't mind a few

16:30.420 --> 16:31.387
softball questions.

16:31.420 --> 16:32.512
JUDGE:
My goodness,

16:32.550 --> 16:33.756
the sarcasm
is as thick as butter

16:33.790 --> 16:35.417
here today.

16:35.460 --> 16:38.384
I don't mind being questioned
by Mr. Childs, Your Honor.

16:38.430 --> 16:39.624
In fact, I welcome it.

16:39.660 --> 16:42.197
JUDGE:
Well, then, let's take a
short break for lunch, and

16:42.230 --> 16:45.063
pick up right where
we left off.

16:47.800 --> 16:49.358
(car alarm chrips)

16:49.400 --> 16:51.402
(indistinct police radio
transmissions)

16:55.310 --> 16:57.301
(women crying)

17:06.190 --> 17:08.158
WOMAN:
She was selling drugs.

17:08.190 --> 17:10.522
I bet it was
a drug deal gone bad.

17:10.560 --> 17:12.187
Come on, you
don't know that.

17:12.230 --> 17:14.118
I knew her better
than you did.

17:14.160 --> 17:15.627
Look, I think
it was that guy

17:15.660 --> 17:17.423
from the neighborhood
where she babysat.

17:17.470 --> 17:20.098
She always said
he was a nuisance.

17:20.140 --> 17:21.038
Hi.

17:21.070 --> 17:23.561
Excuse me,
but do you guys have a minute?

17:23.610 --> 17:24.759
Yeah.

17:24.810 --> 17:26.437
Sorry. I have
to go to class.

17:26.470 --> 17:29.030
All right. Hey, I'll see
you after Comp, okay?

17:31.450 --> 17:33.509
So, are you a cop?

17:33.550 --> 17:35.609
Nope. Homicide.

17:37.720 --> 17:39.119
Would you
mind, please?

17:39.150 --> 17:40.219
Yeah.

17:40.260 --> 17:42.785
What you were saying about
Lisa Pruitt's babysitting--

17:42.820 --> 17:45.357
she ever mention anything
to you about a guard?

17:45.390 --> 17:48.154
No. No. A secure...?

17:48.200 --> 17:49.849
No.

17:49.900 --> 17:52.221
It was the dad that
she was working for.

17:52.270 --> 17:53.532
Um, what's his name?

17:53.570 --> 17:55.333
Burkle, or, uh, Rucker.

17:55.370 --> 17:57.429
She said that he was
getting too close.

17:57.470 --> 17:58.607
Making her
uncomfortable.

17:58.640 --> 18:01.234
They were working on something
together, some project,

18:01.280 --> 18:03.202
and she said she
was gonna qunt.

18:03.250 --> 18:05.206
So,

18:05.250 --> 18:08.219
um, do you want me to make
a statement or something?

18:08.250 --> 18:09.842
...we'll call you,
okay? All right.
Mm. Yeah.

18:11.150 --> 18:12.811
Look, um, not right now,

18:12.850 --> 18:15.182
but maybe you and I could
meet up later,

18:15.220 --> 18:17.120
and I could take it down then.

18:17.160 --> 18:20.323
LOU:
So, you threw away
your ticket stub.

18:20.360 --> 18:22.157
Is that it?
JASON:
Yes.

18:22.200 --> 18:23.758
Okay.

18:23.800 --> 18:26.621
And this Chinese movie--
what was it about?

18:26.670 --> 18:28.638
Legend of the Condor Heroes?

18:28.670 --> 18:30.831
It's about two sons learning
martial arts in Mongolia.

18:30.870 --> 18:32.633
Sounds exciting.

18:32.670 --> 18:33.807
You know Chinese?

18:33.840 --> 18:35.171
Chinese? No.

18:35.210 --> 18:36.438
Then how did you
understand it?

18:36.480 --> 18:37.640
The subtitles.

18:37.680 --> 18:38.840
That's odd.

18:38.880 --> 18:39.949
We checked,

18:39.980 --> 18:42.471
and there were no subtitles
on the print last night.

18:43.850 --> 18:46.546
Usually there are
subtitles, but...

18:46.590 --> 18:48.649
not on that one.

18:50.830 --> 18:52.821
Let's take a break
for a second.

18:52.860 --> 18:54.191
Yes.

18:54.230 --> 18:56.323
Let's do that, Mr. Gardner.

18:57.370 --> 18:58.894
ALICIA:
Detective?

18:58.930 --> 19:00.192
The camera.

19:00.240 --> 19:01.264
Mmm.

19:11.750 --> 19:13.775
What's going on?
It has nothing
to do with this.

19:13.820 --> 19:14.946
Mr. Rucker, you
don't understand.

19:14.980 --> 19:16.140
The decisions you make right now

19:16.180 --> 19:18.614
you'll regret for decades
if you don't make them right.

19:18.650 --> 19:20.618
CARY:
Yeah.

19:20.660 --> 19:22.309
Look, I just...

19:22.360 --> 19:24.749
You don't know what it's like
to be out of work,

19:24.790 --> 19:26.326
to be stuck at home.

19:26.360 --> 19:28.499
I do. So tell me.

19:31.700 --> 19:33.861
I have a place to work, to do...

19:33.900 --> 19:36.368
I do graphic novels.

19:36.400 --> 19:38.300
But... but just on spec.

19:38.340 --> 19:39.807
I'm not being paid.

19:39.840 --> 19:42.604
And you do this
work at an office?

19:42.640 --> 19:43.902
That's where you were?

19:43.950 --> 19:45.201
You weren't at the movies?

19:45.250 --> 19:47.218
Yeah, it's just
a studio to draw.

19:47.250 --> 19:49.411
It's nothing.
It's the size of a closet.

19:49.450 --> 19:52.681
WILL:
And Lisa Pruitt was
working with you?

19:55.290 --> 19:57.622
Our investigator is talking
to a friend of Pruitt's.

19:57.660 --> 20:00.299
She did some writing
for your graphic novel?

20:00.330 --> 20:02.389
Yes.

20:02.430 --> 20:04.364
Were you sleeping with her?

20:05.400 --> 20:07.288
No.

20:09.040 --> 20:11.008
So, what's in the studio?

20:11.040 --> 20:12.962
What's in there that
the police might misunderstand?

20:13.010 --> 20:14.307
I don't know.

20:14.340 --> 20:15.477
ALICIA:
Has she been there?

20:15.510 --> 20:17.273
Has Lisa been there?

20:17.310 --> 20:18.971
Yes.

20:19.010 --> 20:21.274
Once. Look,
I didn't say anything

20:21.320 --> 20:22.639
'cause I knew how it would look.

20:22.680 --> 20:24.489
So, where is this?

20:24.520 --> 20:25.942
Where is this studio?

20:25.990 --> 20:27.309
(siren wailing)

20:27.360 --> 20:28.349
What do you have?

20:28.390 --> 20:30.620
Looks like your client
had a little love nest.

20:30.660 --> 20:32.787
Just found out about it
on the victim's computer.

20:32.830 --> 20:34.991
You know the security guard
had priors for selling dope?

20:35.030 --> 20:36.588
Dope?
Yeah. And a hero complex.

20:36.630 --> 20:37.892
That's fascinating.
Keep on that.

20:37.930 --> 20:38.862
There are three

20:38.900 --> 20:41.289
unexplained burglaries
in the last six months.

20:41.340 --> 20:44.662
All on the same nights
the security guard worked.

20:48.610 --> 20:50.646
(sighs)

20:53.780 --> 20:56.374
Damn. I just sent Alicia off
to check it out.

20:56.420 --> 20:57.978
KALINDA:
She's got about ten minutes.

20:58.020 --> 21:00.011
Okay. Calling.

21:02.960 --> 21:05.053
WILL:
Alicia, where are you?

21:05.090 --> 21:08.651
I'm, uh... looking for the key.

21:08.700 --> 21:10.520
Didn't he say
it was on a pipe?

21:10.570 --> 21:13.368
Yes, and, not to put
too much pressure on you,

21:13.400 --> 21:14.992
but the police are on their way.

21:15.040 --> 21:15.995
On their way here?

21:16.040 --> 21:18.008
Yes. They're about ten minutes
behind you. Now,

21:18.040 --> 21:20.065
it's not a crime scene,
so you're fine

21:20.110 --> 21:21.702
to inspect
and take anything you want.

21:21.740 --> 21:23.344
Anything I want?
What are we saying?

21:23.380 --> 21:24.506
I have the key.

21:24.550 --> 21:26.370
Look”.

21:26.410 --> 21:29.072
Look, I don't know what
you're going to find in there,

21:29.120 --> 21:31.338
but until the police
declare it a crime scene,

21:31.390 --> 21:33.358
you can preserve
for our uses anything you find.

21:33.390 --> 21:35.017
Has Jason said anything?

21:35.060 --> 21:37.016
No, but the police
could misunderstand

21:37.060 --> 21:38.152
something they find.

21:38.190 --> 21:40.954
And Kalinda thinks the
security guard is heating up.

21:41.000 --> 21:42.319
Here's something she wrote.

21:42.360 --> 21:44.396
A short story.

21:44.430 --> 21:47.069
Okay, I think we could use that.

21:51.370 --> 21:54.703
There's a blonde hair
in a brush.

21:54.740 --> 21:56.378
(sighs)

21:56.410 --> 21:58.344
What do I do?

22:00.010 --> 22:02.012
Is it a long hair?

22:03.050 --> 22:04.938
Yes.

22:04.990 --> 22:06.981
(Lou speaking indistinctly)

22:08.820 --> 22:10.822
Take it.

22:14.130 --> 22:15.950
No hair in the drain.

22:16.000 --> 22:17.865
Thanks. Good.

22:21.440 --> 22:23.863
There's a bra on the towel rack.

22:25.510 --> 22:27.501
One second.

22:30.810 --> 22:34.109
(siren wailing)

22:35.180 --> 22:37.387
(tires squealing)

22:38.790 --> 22:40.712
They're here.

22:50.430 --> 22:51.590
(door closing)

22:51.630 --> 22:54.633
(Tony speaking indistinctly)

23:01.040 --> 23:03.099
(speaking indistinctly)

23:16.190 --> 23:17.851
Thanks.

23:22.830 --> 23:24.161
You all right?

23:24.200 --> 23:25.497
I think so.

23:25.530 --> 23:27.430
You were well within the law.

23:27.470 --> 23:28.767
"Well"?

23:29.800 --> 23:31.506
You were within the law.

23:31.540 --> 23:33.576
I know it feels like we're
playing a game sometimes,

23:33.610 --> 23:35.498
but we're not here
to pursue the truth.

23:35.540 --> 23:37.076
We're here to defend a client.

23:37.110 --> 23:38.441
And if he's guilty?

23:38.480 --> 23:39.777
Then, he's guilty.

23:39.810 --> 23:41.744
Truth is above our pay grade.

23:43.920 --> 23:45.512
Who's with Jason now?

23:45.550 --> 23:46.812
Cary.

23:46.850 --> 23:48.215
Take a few hours off.

23:48.260 --> 23:50.888
Get some lunch or something.
Are you going
to go back

23:50.930 --> 23:52.784
to help Cary?

23:52.830 --> 23:54.525
Yes.

23:57.000 --> 23:58.194
Go.
Mmm.

23:58.230 --> 24:00.118
Get this off your mind.

24:01.740 --> 24:02.764
ALICIA:
She telling her?

24:02.800 --> 24:04.062
Yep.

24:04.110 --> 24:06.135
That can't be a
fun conversation.

24:06.170 --> 24:07.706
Nope.

24:07.740 --> 24:10.129
Why do you not look surprised?

24:10.180 --> 24:12.000
You knew he had a studio?

24:12.050 --> 24:14.746
No, but...

24:14.780 --> 24:17.840
every marriage runs
on a few secrets, Diane.

24:17.890 --> 24:19.517
Men need their caves.

24:19.550 --> 24:21.154
Did you know he was working
with her

24:21.190 --> 24:23.010
on writing a graphic novel?

24:23.060 --> 24:25.153
No.

24:25.190 --> 24:26.726
I knew something.

24:26.760 --> 24:29.524
It's been hard for him since
he's been out of work--

24:29.560 --> 24:31.699
for me to be the one
earnIng the money.

24:31.730 --> 24:33.766
So, did you ever think
that he and Lisa...?

24:33.800 --> 24:35.836
Why do I suddenly feel
as though I'm under suspicion?

24:35.870 --> 24:37.599
Sonya, the question
is going to be asked.

24:37.640 --> 24:40.108
If there's something
that you want to tell me,

24:40.140 --> 24:41.607
now is a good time.

24:41.640 --> 24:43.073
No.

24:43.110 --> 24:45.078
Well, then...

24:45.110 --> 24:46.941
is he innocent?
Of?

24:48.780 --> 24:50.077
Hurting her?

24:50.120 --> 24:52.247
Yes. Yes, he's innocent of that.

24:52.290 --> 24:53.689
But sleeping
with her--

24:53.720 --> 24:56.018
he's not innocent
of sleeping With her?

24:56.060 --> 24:57.584
I don't know.

24:57.630 --> 24:59.723
(sighs)

24:59.760 --> 25:02.649
Is there--
Sonya, I-I hate to do this,

25:02.700 --> 25:04.691
but Jason isn't being up-front
with us--

25:04.730 --> 25:06.891
is there anything
that would lead the police

25:06.930 --> 25:09.592
to believe
that he is guilty?

25:09.640 --> 25:11.801
There might be.

25:11.840 --> 25:14.172
Let's start with
the easier questions, shall we?

25:14.210 --> 25:16.770
How many times did you sleep
with this prostitute,

25:16.810 --> 25:18.607
Amber Madison?
Objection,
Your Honor.

25:18.650 --> 25:20.106
Sex is not relevant
to my client's gUIlt.

25:20.150 --> 25:21.617
Mr. Florrick was sentenced

25:21.650 --> 25:24.642
for DP'ing cases
in trade for sexual favors,

25:24.690 --> 25:27.989
so sex is entirely relevant
to his guilt, Your Honor.

25:28.020 --> 25:30.580
The fact of the sex is relevant,
Your Honor, but not the minutia.

25:30.630 --> 25:33.019
Then I will endeavor
to discern the minutia.

25:33.060 --> 25:35.722
You may continue, Mr. Childs,
but, oh, so carefully.

25:35.760 --> 25:38.194
How many times did you sleep
with Amber Madison?

25:38.230 --> 25:40.164
Well, just to be
precise, Mr. Childs,

25:40.200 --> 25:42.191
by "sleeping with,"
you mean "having sex"?

25:42.240 --> 25:43.332
Yes. Thank you.

25:43.370 --> 25:45.702
And just to be
even more precise,

25:45.740 --> 25:50.006
by "having sex," I will also
include oral-genital contact.

25:50.040 --> 25:51.678
18 times.

25:51.710 --> 25:52.677
18 times.

25:52.710 --> 25:54.712
Mm-hmm.
And would you classify

25:54.750 --> 25:56.911
any of these
as oral-genital contact?

25:56.950 --> 25:58.212
Objection.

25:58.250 --> 25:59.842
Minutia, Mr. Childs.

25:59.890 --> 26:01.710
Thank you, Your Honor.

26:05.630 --> 26:08.349
Now, were these assignations
with Amber Madison...

26:08.400 --> 26:11.324
were they in hotel rooms?

26:11.370 --> 26:12.997
Yes.
All 18 of them,

26:13.030 --> 26:14.759
you were in a hotel room?

26:14.800 --> 26:17.633
To the best of my memory.

26:17.670 --> 26:21.606
Well, let's see
if we can refresh your memory.

26:21.640 --> 26:24.370
Did you ever sleep
with Amber Madison

26:24.410 --> 26:27.618
at your home while
your wife was away?

26:27.650 --> 26:28.844
Objection.

26:28.880 --> 26:29.812
Your Honor, the defendant

26:29.850 --> 26:32.284
has made it very clear
he believed he paid

26:32.320 --> 26:34.857
for these various hotel sessions
with Amber Madison.

26:34.890 --> 26:36.687
We just want to be clear

26:36.720 --> 26:38.278
that these were
the only ses5ions.

26:42.160 --> 26:43.764
Overruled.

26:44.700 --> 26:46.122
So, Mr. Florrick,

26:46.170 --> 26:49.264
did you ever sleep
with Amber Madison

26:49.300 --> 26:53.259
at your home, in your bed,
while your wife was away?

26:53.310 --> 26:54.868
No.

26:54.910 --> 26:56.639
And you know you're under oath?

26:56.680 --> 26:58.978
Cammy, let it be stated
that I know I'm under oath,

26:59.010 --> 27:02.946
and I know that Mr. Childs
is trying to catch me

27:02.980 --> 27:05.687
in a perjury trap,
and yes,

27:05.720 --> 27:07.608
my answer is still no.

27:08.460 --> 27:10.382
Thank you, Mr. Florrick.

27:10.420 --> 27:11.887
No problem.

27:17.970 --> 27:19.961
She set up a nanny cam
in the living room

27:20.000 --> 27:21.968
to see if her husband was
sleeping with the babysitter.

27:22.000 --> 27:24.400
Well, would've been helpful
to know.

27:24.440 --> 27:27.159
Yes. More secrets
than an O'Neill play here.

27:27.210 --> 27:29.405
It's in a digital clock
on the end table.

27:29.440 --> 27:31.874
I'm not sure I'm going
to be able to get in.

27:31.910 --> 27:33.775
Do you want me
to tell the police?

27:33.820 --> 27:35.412
No. I don't know what's on it.

27:35.450 --> 27:38.180
Sonya says there's a key
under the mat by the front door.

27:38.220 --> 27:40.438
Right. Let me see what I can do.

27:40.490 --> 27:43.653
Oh. Does she have
a laptop case with her?

27:46.330 --> 27:47.422
Yes. Why?

27:47.460 --> 27:49.291
When you get a chance,

27:49.330 --> 27:51.264
check and see
if one of the rubber nubs

27:51.300 --> 27:53.268
on the bottom is missing.

27:53.300 --> 27:54.460
Any particular reason?

27:54.500 --> 27:58.766
The police think it was used
to knock out the babysitter.

28:29.340 --> 28:31.228
Miss Sharma?

28:31.270 --> 28:33.238
Process server.

28:33.270 --> 28:34.771
You've just been
subpoenaed.

28:34.810 --> 28:36.778
Which case?

28:36.810 --> 28:38.402
Florrick's appeal.

28:38.450 --> 28:39.872
Have fun.

28:41.480 --> 28:42.913
KALIN DA:
I'm not testifying.

28:42.950 --> 28:44.144
Then you're going
to jail.

28:44.190 --> 28:45.509
Look, I've got
nothing to offer.

28:45.550 --> 28:46.482
You have everything
to offer.

28:46.520 --> 28:48.056
You know you do.

28:48.090 --> 28:50.388
Peter Florrick lied
on the witness stand.

28:50.420 --> 28:53.218
Tell the truth, he spends
the next nine years in prison.

28:53.260 --> 28:55.125
Glenn.
What?

28:55.160 --> 28:56.491
Don't do this.

28:56.530 --> 28:58.168
Come on, Kalinda.
What do you care?

28:58.200 --> 28:59.394
You're out for yourself.

28:59.430 --> 29:00.931
You've always been out
for yourself.

29:00.970 --> 29:02.790
And either way, you're going
to tell the truth.

29:02.840 --> 29:03.761
You don't know that.

29:03.810 --> 29:05.869
_ I know that the sun
is coming up tomorrow,

29:05.910 --> 29:07.502
and that you are going
to tell the truth on the stand

29:07.540 --> 29:08.837
and Florrick
is going back to prison.

29:08.880 --> 29:10.029
End of story.

29:28.830 --> 29:30.354
You okay?

29:30.400 --> 29:31.924
Yeah.

29:34.340 --> 29:35.568
What time is it?

29:35.600 --> 29:36.897
Midnight.

29:36.940 --> 29:38.532
How long have I been here?

29:38.570 --> 29:40.128
Day and a half.

29:40.170 --> 29:41.808
I was freaking out.

29:43.280 --> 29:44.577
Yes, I know.

29:44.610 --> 29:46.248
Did you tell Will?

29:49.480 --> 29:51.516
What, that you
were freaking out?

29:51.550 --> 29:53.211
No. Why?

29:53.250 --> 29:55.411
It was a friend of mine
from the Peace Corps.

29:55.460 --> 29:57.052
I thought I had
the day off.

29:57.090 --> 29:58.489
Cary, I didn't tell him.

29:58.530 --> 30:01.328
Why didn't you?

30:01.360 --> 30:04.591
With the contest, you know,
why-why didn't you tell him?

30:04.630 --> 30:06.598
I...

30:06.630 --> 30:08.564
There are so many people
lined up against us,

30:08.600 --> 30:10.568
I just don't want one more.

30:13.010 --> 30:14.875
I don't want you to lose.

30:14.910 --> 30:16.605
I know.

30:16.640 --> 30:18.870
I don't want you to lose,
either.

30:18.910 --> 30:21.378
I kind of like you.

30:23.550 --> 30:26.610
I'm surprised,
but I kind of like you, too.

30:26.650 --> 30:28.049
Ah, I can't help it, you know.

30:28.090 --> 30:29.614
Being competitive--
it's just me.

30:29.660 --> 30:31.218
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

30:31.260 --> 30:33.182
Not the scorpion
and the frog story, please.

30:33.230 --> 30:34.925
(laughs)

30:34.960 --> 30:36.450
The scorpion on the frog's back.

30:36.500 --> 30:37.922
Yeah, I hate that story, too.

30:37.970 --> 30:39.198
Why do people tell it so much?

30:39.230 --> 30:41.437
Because it excu_ses
people's behaVIor.

30:45.440 --> 30:46.634
CARY:
How's he doing?

30:46.670 --> 30:48.979
ALICIA:
You don't want to know.

30:49.010 --> 30:50.477
Try me.

31:05.990 --> 31:07.321
What?

31:07.360 --> 31:09.225
So, you were at the office
all night

31:09.260 --> 31:11.899
until you got a call from
security about the silent alarm?

31:11.930 --> 31:13.363
Yes. Why?

31:13.400 --> 31:14.662
You didn't go home
before that?

31:14.700 --> 31:16.190
No. Why would I?

31:16.240 --> 31:18.299
Our investigator
checked the nanny cam.

31:18.340 --> 31:19.659
It hadn't been turned on.

31:19.710 --> 31:22.929
Oh, well, I must have
forgotten that day.
Yes.

31:22.980 --> 31:24.242
We thought only four people

31:24.280 --> 31:25.975
could _disarm
the security alarm--

31:26.010 --> 31:27.546
Jason, your housekeeper,

31:27.580 --> 31:29.411
the babysitter
and the security guard--

31:29.450 --> 31:31.509
but we forgot, you could, too.

31:31.550 --> 31:32.687
Yes.

31:32.720 --> 31:34.415
Why? What's wrong?

31:34.460 --> 31:36.985
We found a notice of a failure

31:37.020 --> 31:39.079
to deliver a package
to your house.

31:39.130 --> 31:40.927
Our investigator checked
with the company.

31:40.960 --> 31:42.359
You signed for a delivery.

31:43.730 --> 31:45.391
At 7:30 pm,

31:45.430 --> 31:47.489
when you said you were at work.

31:49.470 --> 31:51.199
I-I didn't do it.

31:53.040 --> 31:55.702
Okay, so what were you doing
at home?

31:55.740 --> 31:57.298
I was jealous.

31:57.340 --> 31:59.479
I thought Jason
was sleeping with her.

31:59.510 --> 32:01.410
I came home to surprise them.

32:01.450 --> 32:02.542
And?

32:03.580 --> 32:04.979
He wasn't there.

32:05.020 --> 32:06.317
She was there,

32:06.350 --> 32:09.183
reading to the girls.

32:09.220 --> 32:13.680
I left embarrassed, intent
on never being jealous again.

32:13.730 --> 32:16.051
And that was it?

32:16.100 --> 32:16.953
That was it.

32:17.000 --> 32:19.491
Can I check your laptop?

32:19.530 --> 32:20.997
Why?

32:21.040 --> 32:22.996
Please.

32:28.740 --> 32:30.207
Tired?

32:32.080 --> 32:34.116
Tired doesn't even
begin to describe it.

32:36.580 --> 32:39.413
Okay, so here's what we need
to do.

32:39.450 --> 32:41.156
Build a Chinese wall.

32:41.190 --> 32:43.658
Yep, and you can't tell me
what she said.

32:43.690 --> 32:45.226
Complete separation.

32:45.260 --> 32:46.659
You represent Jason.

32:46.690 --> 32:48.294
I represent her.

32:48.330 --> 32:51.060
Each has a strong motive,
and in about 12 hours,

32:51.100 --> 32:53.068
one of them
is going to be charged.

32:53.100 --> 32:54.988
So, we can't talk
to each other anymore.

32:55.040 --> 32:56.268
Understood.

32:59.610 --> 33:01.407
Good luck.

33:01.440 --> 33:03.135
You, too.

33:04.480 --> 33:07.199
One of us is going to come
out the winner tonight.

33:11.790 --> 33:13.212
I've been subpoenaed.

33:13.250 --> 33:14.683
To what?
Your husband's trial.

33:14.720 --> 33:16.688
Why would they
subpoena you?

33:16.720 --> 33:18.688
I know certain things.

33:18.730 --> 33:20.686
Well, that doesn't
sound good.
Mmm.

33:20.730 --> 33:22.027
Are you going to tell me?

33:23.060 --> 33:25.028
Do you want to know?

33:25.070 --> 33:27.459
I don't know.

33:27.500 --> 33:29.491
Oh, God, I don't
know anymore.

33:29.540 --> 33:31.508
The truth seemed so simple--

33:31.540 --> 33:33.098
lying, not lying.

33:33.140 --> 33:34.402
Do you want him out?

33:41.820 --> 33:44.789
I just want things
to stop spinning.

33:44.820 --> 33:46.811
You're right, I
don't want to know.

33:46.850 --> 33:49.717
Stay away from court tomorrow.

33:50.760 --> 33:52.682
(phone rings)

33:52.730 --> 33:55.699
Alicia Florrick.

33:55.730 --> 33:59.063
Oh, yes, thank you for
getting back to me.

33:59.100 --> 34:01.762
So, (clears throat)
Lisa Pruitt would...

34:03.800 --> 34:05.438
I see.

34:05.470 --> 34:07.108
Right.

34:07.140 --> 34:08.437
Well, thank you.

34:08.480 --> 34:10.607
What?

34:10.640 --> 34:12.073
That was this lawyer.

34:12.110 --> 34:13.543
I found it

34:13.580 --> 34:16.071
near the belongings of the
victim in Rucker's studio.

34:16.120 --> 34:17.769
Lot of lavwers running
around this one.

34:17.820 --> 34:19.788
I don't even know who
we're defending anymore.

34:19.820 --> 34:21.788
It's gotten very confusing.

34:21.820 --> 34:23.708
Yeah.

34:23.760 --> 34:26.149
The lawyer wouldn't tell
me if Lisa Pruitt had
been in to see her.

34:26.190 --> 34:28.124
Of course not.
That would be too easy.

34:28.160 --> 34:31.596
But she did tell me what
kind of work they do.

34:31.630 --> 34:35.794
Matching pregnant women with
families who want to adopt.

34:39.870 --> 34:41.679
Detective, I need you to stop
interrogating my client

34:41.710 --> 34:43.803
and step out.
I was just asking a question.

34:43.840 --> 34:44.738
ALICIA:
You can finish later.

34:44.780 --> 34:45.769
Please.

34:52.220 --> 34:54.108
What's wrong?

34:54.160 --> 34:55.559
(door slams)

34:55.590 --> 34:57.581
You got her pregnant.

34:57.620 --> 34:59.520
She was at your
little studio...

34:59.560 --> 35:02.222
No. What? No.

35:02.260 --> 35:03.796
She went to a law firm
for adoption.

35:03.830 --> 35:07.129
Tell me now because they're
going to find this out

35:07.170 --> 35:08.364
during an autopsy.

35:08.400 --> 35:09.594
You got her pregnant.

35:09.640 --> 35:11.858
No, I couldn't have.
She was at your studio.

35:11.910 --> 35:13.559
Yes, I know, but I didn't
get her pregnant.

35:13.610 --> 35:15.532
Tell me the truth.
I couldn't
have gotten her pregnant.

35:15.580 --> 35:17.207
I had a vasectomy.

35:23.380 --> 35:24.813
Hey.

35:24.850 --> 35:27.341
I was wondering when you were
coming back for that statement.

35:27.390 --> 35:29.813
Yeah, I'm sorry I'm so late.

35:29.860 --> 35:31.851
A couple more questions came up

35:31.890 --> 35:33.926
about Lisa Pruitt.

35:33.960 --> 35:35.894
She ever mention anything to you
about being pregnant?

35:35.930 --> 35:37.727
Who said that?

35:37.760 --> 35:38.692
Oh, her lawyer.

35:38.730 --> 35:40.288
She was contacting
a law firm

35:40.330 --> 35:41.866
about putting a baby up
for adoption.

35:41.900 --> 35:43.561
Yeah, she told me.

35:43.600 --> 35:44.862
She say who the father is?

35:46.910 --> 35:49.538
Who she babysits for-- Rucker.

35:49.580 --> 35:51.605
Really?

35:51.650 --> 35:53.277
Yeah.

35:53.310 --> 35:54.777
That's why I think he did it.

35:54.820 --> 35:55.844
Killed her.

35:55.880 --> 35:58.644
He wanted her to have
an abortion, she said no.

35:58.690 --> 35:59.941
Did she tell you that?

35:59.990 --> 36:00.888
Yeah.

36:00.920 --> 36:03.388
He, uh, he didn't want
to be pinned down.

36:05.430 --> 36:07.682
You know, this is...
this is all very helpful.

36:07.730 --> 36:10.324
You want me to say
the same thing to the cops?

36:10.360 --> 36:11.827
Yeah.

36:11.870 --> 36:13.826
Can you come with me now?

36:13.870 --> 36:14.837
Yeah.

36:14.870 --> 36:16.235
Just-just give me a minute.

36:16.270 --> 36:18.261
Sure.

36:37.390 --> 36:39.381
What's wrong?

36:39.430 --> 36:41.318
Nothing.

36:50.970 --> 36:53.234
Miss Sharma,

36:53.270 --> 36:55.238
the defendant fired you

36:55.280 --> 36:56.736
from the State's Attorney
Office, didn't he?

36:56.780 --> 36:57.872
Yes, he did.

36:57.910 --> 36:58.899
Now, in your own words,

36:58.950 --> 37:01.714
could you explain
why he did that?

37:01.750 --> 37:03.377
He said I was
working two jobs.

37:03.420 --> 37:04.887
And were you?
Yes.

37:04.920 --> 37:07.548
So you were working for him,
and you were working for...?

37:07.590 --> 37:08.989
You.

37:09.020 --> 37:10.715
And what kind of work
were you doing for me?

37:10.760 --> 37:12.955
I was running down
bimbo eruptions.

37:12.990 --> 37:14.821
Would you please explain
that colloquialism?

37:14.860 --> 37:15.997
Your Honor, again,

37:16.030 --> 37:18.464
we object to this line
of questioning.

37:18.500 --> 37:20.468
Your Honor,
this is our last witness.

37:22.070 --> 37:23.469
Granted.

37:23.500 --> 37:25.001
Overruled, Mr. Golden.

37:25.040 --> 37:27.508
What were bimbo eruptions?

37:27.540 --> 37:28.837
You were worried

37:28.880 --> 37:30.836
that lawyers and judges
were being co-opted

37:30.880 --> 37:34.316
by powerful forces who used
prostitutes to blackmail.

37:34.350 --> 37:36.841
GLENN:
And when you started this task
force, you discovered that

37:36.880 --> 37:40.008
Mr. Florrick was involved
with Amber Madison.

37:40.050 --> 37:41.711
Would you please explain

37:41.760 --> 37:43.751
how she was used
to co-opt Mr. Florrick?

37:43.790 --> 37:46.452
A procurer assigned
specific prostitutes

37:46.490 --> 37:48.492
to flatter and pursue
certain clients.

37:48.530 --> 37:51.829
And the clients were
referred to by number.

37:51.870 --> 37:55.738
For example, one of the clients
was referred to as Client 12.

37:57.700 --> 37:59.304
And what did these...
these women do?

37:59.340 --> 38:00.659
These-these prostitutes?

38:00.710 --> 38:03.031
They would discover

38:03.080 --> 38:06.800
the marital status and sexual
predilections of these clients.

38:06.850 --> 38:09.648
To use the example
of Client 12,

38:09.680 --> 38:12.786
um, he was found
to be a judge,

38:12.820 --> 38:15.789
a married judge,
with three daughters,

38:15.820 --> 38:18.323
and he was deemed
to be interested

38:18.360 --> 38:20.487
in African-American
prostitutes,

38:20.530 --> 38:22.998
and the imagery of
Southern plantation life.

38:23.030 --> 38:25.328
Okay.

38:25.370 --> 38:27.326
Um...

38:27.370 --> 38:30.669
once Mr. Florrick was involved
with Amber Madison,

38:30.700 --> 38:32.668
no money exchanged hands,
isn't that correct?

38:32.710 --> 38:34.007
Yes, that is correct.

38:34.040 --> 38:36.770
And if a client
tried to pay,

38:36.810 --> 38:39.449
a procurer would refund
the client's money.

38:39.480 --> 38:41.619
Like when Client 12
tried to pay

38:41.650 --> 38:44.073
for an evening out with two
African-American women,

38:44.120 --> 38:45.940
that money was
refunded.

38:45.990 --> 38:48.652
Miss Sharma, you don't need
to refer to a particular client.

38:48.690 --> 38:50.658
Just answer my question.

38:50.690 --> 38:53.022
But I've been asked to answer
in my own words.

38:53.060 --> 38:55.051
These are my own words.

38:55.100 --> 38:57.989
Right, your words could
be a bit more on point.

38:58.030 --> 39:01.898
Now, did Mr. Florrick

39:01.940 --> 39:05.535
have sexual relations with
Amber Madison at his home?

39:05.570 --> 39:08.903
To answer that question,
I need to talk about my job,

39:08.940 --> 39:10.931
and how important

39:10.980 --> 39:13.505
it was for me to know the
names of all the clients,

39:13.550 --> 39:14.812
including Client 12.

39:14.850 --> 39:16.078
Kalinda.

39:16.120 --> 39:18.611
I'm here under subpoena,
Mr. Childs.

39:18.650 --> 39:20.481
If I'm asked to name the names
of the clients, I must.

39:20.520 --> 39:22.659
Right?

39:25.660 --> 39:27.924
Um, Your Honor,

39:27.960 --> 39:30.497
uh, again,
we object to this, uh,

39:30.530 --> 39:31.724
sexual line of questioning.

39:31.770 --> 39:32.919
It's-it's irrelevant,

39:32.970 --> 39:35.564
just like the names
of these clients

39:35.600 --> 39:36.760
is irrelevant.

39:36.800 --> 39:38.506
We respectfully submit

39:38.540 --> 39:41.031
that this is beneath
the dignity of this court.

39:41.070 --> 39:42.276
I would tend to agree,
Mr. Golden.

39:42.310 --> 39:45.074
Surely, Your Honor, there is
a way to elicit this testimony,

39:45.110 --> 39:46.407
possibly in chambers?

39:46.450 --> 39:47.906
Not_without these
clients' names

39:47.950 --> 39:50.510
becoming part of,
uh, public record.

39:50.550 --> 39:51.778
Isn't that right,
Miss Sharma?

39:51.820 --> 39:53.082
Yes, I'm afraid so.

39:53.120 --> 39:55.088
JUDGE:
I've given too much leeway
to this sexual testimony,

39:55.120 --> 39:56.485
Mr. State's Attorney.

39:56.520 --> 39:58.112
Now I must call it to a halt.

39:58.160 --> 39:59.684
Your Honor...
No, Sir.

39:59.730 --> 40:01.027
It is 4:00 pm.

40:01.060 --> 40:03.096
and I find myself unpersuaded
by your arguments

40:03.130 --> 40:04.961
of Mr. Florrick's guilt.

40:05.000 --> 40:06.194
I believe this was
nothing more

40:06.230 --> 40:07.492
than a sexual
witch hunt.

40:07.530 --> 40:10.135
But that's not for me to decide.

40:10.170 --> 40:13.958
My job is merely to determine if
there is enough for a new trial,

40:14.010 --> 40:16.205
and I believe,
Mr. Florrick, there is.

40:16.240 --> 40:18.777
I'm sorry,
Mr. Florrick.

40:18.810 --> 40:20.209
I'm sorry this has
happened to you.

40:20.250 --> 40:21.399
And I'm sorry

40:21.450 --> 40:24.442
I don't have the power to do
more than order a new trial.

40:24.490 --> 40:27.539
But that is exactly
what I'm going to do.

40:27.590 --> 40:31.219
You, Mr. Florrick,
have been granted a retrial.

40:31.260 --> 40:32.989
Yes!
(gavel bangs, gallery exclaims)

40:33.030 --> 40:35.749
(applause)

40:36.930 --> 40:38.921
(excited chattering)

40:47.110 --> 40:48.839
The kid from
the dorm was

40:48.880 --> 40:50.108
right about the motive.

40:50.140 --> 40:51.505
It was just his motive,

40:51.550 --> 40:52.699
not Jason's.

40:52.750 --> 40:53.876
She wouldn't
get an abortion?

40:53.910 --> 40:56.913
They argued,
and he killed her.

40:58.920 --> 41:02.788
How did Lisa's bra get
in Jason's studio?

41:02.820 --> 41:05.527
Jason gave her the keys,

41:05.560 --> 41:08.188
and her and Max would go there
when he wasn't around.

41:08.230 --> 41:11.199
At least that's
what Jason said.

41:11.230 --> 41:13.562
They don't look
so happy, do they?

41:13.600 --> 41:15.591
I don't understand
marriage.

41:15.640 --> 41:18.609
It's a mysterious
institution.

41:18.640 --> 41:20.608
You never wanted it?

41:20.640 --> 41:22.608
Is that a proposal?
Yes.

41:22.640 --> 41:25.643
I've been watching you
from afar.

41:27.650 --> 41:30.517
(chuckles)

41:37.890 --> 41:40.859
This is weird.

41:40.890 --> 41:42.858
Maybe you should watch TV.

41:42.900 --> 41:45.221
There's nothing on.

41:45.270 --> 41:48.535
We could play
20 questions.

41:50.140 --> 41:51.232
Does he have a key?

41:51.270 --> 41:52.635
He'll knock.

41:52.670 --> 41:53.830
So, it'll be

41:53.870 --> 41:55.201
electronic monitoring?

41:55.240 --> 41:56.878
He'll have to stay here
in the apartment?

41:56.910 --> 41:58.548
Yes.

41:58.580 --> 42:00.502
And we will all have to adapt.

42:05.950 --> 42:07.679
Okay, maybe we should
just get on with...

42:07.720 --> 42:08.880
(knocking on door)

42:11.930 --> 42:13.022
Here we go.

42:13.060 --> 42:15.858
(clears throat)

42:15.900 --> 42:18.050
I love you both.

42:43.320 --> 42:45.322
Hi.
