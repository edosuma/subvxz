01:41.935 --> 01:46.395
Oh, and college hunks
are home for the holidays.

01:46.540 --> 01:47.564
(sighs)

01:47.708 --> 01:50.507
Now, let's see
what we have here.

01:50.644 --> 01:52.442
Ah, Mother Kelp's present.

01:52.579 --> 01:54.172
I hope she likes it.

01:54.314 --> 01:56.305
She should.
It's a hundred proof.

01:57.818 --> 01:59.217
Oh.

01:59.353 --> 02:01.014
Oh, let me see. What's that?

02:01.154 --> 02:02.588
Here's Uncle Ben's present.

02:02.723 --> 02:04.384
I hope I got the right size.

02:04.524 --> 02:07.255
Mom, you got him handkerchiefs.

(muffled mumbling outside)

02:11.298 --> 02:12.527
(thumping)

02:12.666 --> 02:13.963
Maybe it's Santa Claus.

02:14.101 --> 02:15.398
Oh, Mom.

02:15.535 --> 02:18.402
You're no fun
since you stopped believing.

02:18.538 --> 02:19.733
(shivering)

02:19.873 --> 02:22.069
(laughs)

02:22.209 --> 02:23.176
Hi, Rich. Cold?

02:23.310 --> 02:25.176
Oh, that reminds me.

02:25.312 --> 02:26.677
I've got to take the turkey
out of the freezer.

02:26.813 --> 02:27.905
-(muffled mumbling)
- You got to come in.

02:28.048 --> 02:30.039
It's freezing; hurry up.

02:32.052 --> 02:34.146
Let's get him over to the fire.
Come on.

02:34.287 --> 02:35.379
Come here.

02:35.522 --> 02:37.786
(muffled mumbling)

02:37.924 --> 02:39.983
Joanie, what-what is
he trying to say?

02:40.127 --> 02:41.322
Well, it sounded like he said

02:41.461 --> 02:43.429
that the scarf is frozen
to his... (mumbles)

02:43.563 --> 02:45.258
- Oh, Richard.
- Take it off.

02:45.399 --> 02:46.423
You poor dear.

02:46.566 --> 02:48.261
I thought they had heat
in the post office.

02:48.402 --> 02:49.665
-(shivers)
- Remember, Mom,

02:49.803 --> 02:52.272
nature boy here didn't want
to be cooped up inside.

02:52.406 --> 02:53.771
Change your mind, Rich?

02:53.907 --> 02:56.433
(mock laughs)

02:56.576 --> 02:59.910
When are they gonna
invent lip mittens?

03:00.047 --> 03:02.038
Daddy's home!

03:06.887 --> 03:09.083
Hey, everybody,
I want you all to get ready,

03:09.222 --> 03:11.919
because I brought home
a holiday surprise!

03:12.059 --> 03:12.992
It's a Christmas tree!

03:13.126 --> 03:14.321
You got the Christmas tree,
right?

03:14.461 --> 03:15.519
You guessed it!

03:15.662 --> 03:17.391
Oh, I bet it's big
and we can decorate it.

03:17.531 --> 03:20.228
I'll help you carry it in
if you wait till spring.

03:20.367 --> 03:21.892
I can't wait that long.

03:22.035 --> 03:23.525
Besides, you don't
have to help me.

03:23.670 --> 03:27.300
I got it right here.

03:27.441 --> 03:29.102
Howard, what is that?

03:29.242 --> 03:33.839
This, Marion, is a boon to
mankind, a major breakthrough.

03:33.980 --> 03:34.970
Oh...

03:35.115 --> 03:37.743
And a special this week
at Cunningham Hardware.

03:37.884 --> 03:40.785
Oh, Dad, not an artificial tree.

03:40.921 --> 03:42.980
This is not an artificial tree.

03:43.123 --> 03:44.613
This is aluminum.

03:44.758 --> 03:46.522
(laughs)

03:47.794 --> 03:49.660
Look, Richard,
lend me a hand, will you?

03:49.796 --> 03:51.423
There must be
some instructions in there.

03:51.565 --> 03:54.159
Yeah, sure, right here.

03:54.301 --> 03:55.826
Oh, Dad, uh...

03:55.969 --> 03:58.768
do you read Japanese
left to right or top to bottom?

03:58.905 --> 04:01.897
What difference does it make?

04:02.042 --> 04:03.771
It's quite simple, you see?

04:03.910 --> 04:06.174
You just take
one of these branches,

04:06.313 --> 04:09.010
and you stick it in
these little holes right here,

04:09.149 --> 04:10.139
and voila!

04:10.283 --> 04:11.341
Isn't that nice, huh?

04:11.485 --> 04:12.748
Yeah.

04:12.886 --> 04:15.048
Real nice if it's for a tin man.

04:15.188 --> 04:18.589
Well, it's... it's shiny.

04:18.725 --> 04:21.091
Yeah, we're gonna save
big bucks on tinsel.

04:21.228 --> 04:22.889
(doorbell rings)

04:23.029 --> 04:24.360
Ugh. It's my get,

04:24.498 --> 04:26.694
Now bring that over here,
sweetheart.

04:26.833 --> 04:28.562
- Hi.
- Oh, hello.

04:28.702 --> 04:29.794
Can I help you?

04:29.936 --> 04:30.835
Uh, yeah, kid.

04:30.971 --> 04:33.099
I'm looking for
Arthur Fonzarelli.

04:33.240 --> 04:34.765
Oh, well, he's not here.

04:34.908 --> 04:36.808
He's, uh, got the apartment
over the garage.

04:36.943 --> 04:38.377
Well, I'll show you where it is.

04:38.512 --> 04:39.445
Merry Christmas, folks.

04:39.579 --> 04:41.513
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

04:41.648 --> 04:45.448
Ah. You know, the nice thing
about this, it lasts forever.

04:47.154 --> 04:49.088
Good news, Dad.

04:50.223 --> 04:51.554
The snow's off the roof.

04:58.965 --> 05:01.400
Now, I ask you, who needs elves?

05:01.535 --> 05:03.196
(laughs)

05:03.336 --> 05:04.667
(women laugh)

05:04.805 --> 05:06.102
Hey, got your tickle bone, huh?

05:06.239 --> 05:07.968
I'll tell you something,
I'll tell you something.

05:08.108 --> 05:10.873
After we finish this work, I'll
show you some serious tickles.

05:11.011 --> 05:11.910
(women ooh, laugh)

05:12.045 --> 05:13.535
(knocking)

05:13.680 --> 05:15.648
Girls, keep doing
what you're doing, all right.

05:15.782 --> 05:18.581
<i>Entrer, entrer.</i>

05:18.718 --> 05:19.583
Whoa.

05:19.719 --> 05:20.777
You Fonzarelli?

05:20.921 --> 05:22.355
All my natural life.

05:22.489 --> 05:23.547
(women laugh)

05:23.690 --> 05:25.249
I got a package for you.

05:25.392 --> 05:26.860
Hey, thanks a lot, huh?

05:26.993 --> 05:28.757
Merry Christmas,
special delivery.

05:28.895 --> 05:30.761
Yeah, sort of.
It's from your father.

05:30.897 --> 05:32.092
Oop, wrong Fonzarelli.

05:32.232 --> 05:33.700
I don't got no old man.

05:33.834 --> 05:36.030
Vito Fonzarelli?

05:37.037 --> 05:38.198
All right, girls, fire drill.

05:38.338 --> 05:39.533
Everybody out. Let's go.

05:39.673 --> 05:41.004
Hurry UP-

05:41.141 --> 05:44.668
I'll see you under my tree,
all right?

05:44.811 --> 05:45.676
Very nice.

05:45.812 --> 05:46.973
Yeah.

05:47.113 --> 05:51.346
They keep me warm, you know,
better than a sweater.

05:51.484 --> 05:54.078
So, uh, you know
my old man, huh?

05:54.221 --> 05:55.347
Yes. I'm...

05:55.488 --> 05:57.149
I met him at a bar in Singapore.

05:57.290 --> 06:00.385
My old man is in New Jersey?

06:00.527 --> 06:01.892
No, no, no.

06:02.028 --> 06:04.122
S-Singapore is in the Orient.

06:04.264 --> 06:06.232
Hey, I know that. I know that.

06:06.366 --> 06:09.427
Well, I told your father
I was shipping out.

06:09.569 --> 06:11.537
He asked me
could I drop off a package,

06:11.671 --> 06:13.503
I said yeah, and here I am.

06:13.640 --> 06:16.302
I haven't seen him
since I was three years old.

06:16.443 --> 06:18.036
He sends me a package.

06:18.178 --> 06:19.270
Whoa.

06:19.412 --> 06:22.814
Well, look, uh, if I run
into old Vito again,

06:22.949 --> 06:25.145
uh, is there anything
you want me to tell him?

06:27.187 --> 06:28.279
Yeah, yeah.

06:28.421 --> 06:31.857
You could tell him
to take this package.

06:32.893 --> 06:35.863
I got nothing
to say to him, ever.

06:36.897 --> 06:39.264
Yeah, well, uh,
I got to be going.

06:39.399 --> 06:42.027
You know, I'm shipping out
tonight and, uh...

06:42.168 --> 06:44.694
uh, well...

06:44.838 --> 06:45.964
you know, Merry Christmas, kid.

06:46.106 --> 06:48.734
Yeah, same to you, Captain.

06:48.875 --> 06:51.742
Hold it, hold it, hold it.

06:51.878 --> 06:53.642
I owe you anything for this?

06:53.780 --> 06:54.770
- Me?
- Yeah, you.

06:54.915 --> 06:56.781
No.

06:56.917 --> 06:58.544
You don't owe me a thing.

06:58.685 --> 07:00.676
So long.

07:00.820 --> 07:03.687
Merry Christmas.

07:03.823 --> 07:06.884
(footsteps sloshing)

07:07.027 --> 07:10.486
Come on in, Red, it's open.

07:10.630 --> 07:11.859
Hey, Fonz.

07:11.998 --> 07:15.525
How'd you know it was me?

07:15.669 --> 07:18.001
I know your galoshes'
slosh anywhere.

07:18.138 --> 07:20.004
(chuckles)

07:20.140 --> 07:21.198
Yeah.

07:21.341 --> 07:22.968
So, uh, what did this guy
want anyway?

07:23.109 --> 07:24.304
Nothing, he didn't want nothing.

07:24.444 --> 07:25.878
He dropped off a package.

07:26.012 --> 07:27.446
Oh, yeah? Who's it from?

07:27.580 --> 07:28.775
Oh, it's not, uh, Ginger?

07:28.915 --> 07:30.280
The one with the big, uh...

07:30.417 --> 07:31.816
The smile?

07:31.952 --> 07:34.819
Big smile? No, no.

07:34.955 --> 07:36.047
Forget it. Forget it.

07:36.189 --> 07:37.987
Hey, look, look what I got
for Christmas, huh?

07:38.124 --> 07:39.990
This is what I'm giving out
for Christmas.

07:40.126 --> 07:43.118
Hey, yeah, this is...
this is great, Fonz.

07:43.263 --> 07:45.391
Look inside. It's got words.

07:45.532 --> 07:46.795
Oh.

07:46.933 --> 07:49.732
Yeah. "To my one true love."

07:49.869 --> 07:50.995
Yeah.

07:51.137 --> 07:52.298
That's fantastic!

07:52.439 --> 07:53.668
Who are you giving this to?

07:53.807 --> 07:55.798
Everybody!

08:00.914 --> 08:02.643
Look at this, right here.

08:02.782 --> 08:06.116
It's adjustable--
one size fits all, huh?

08:06.252 --> 08:08.983
I think that is beautiful
right there.

08:09.122 --> 08:09.987
That's pretty good.

08:10.123 --> 08:11.750
Uh, this package over here--

08:11.891 --> 08:14.861
is this the one that the, uh...
the old salt brought?

08:14.995 --> 08:16.724
Old Salt?

08:16.863 --> 08:18.160
A sailor.

08:18.298 --> 08:19.629
Ah, us writers talk

08:19.766 --> 08:23.396
a little more colorfully
than most people.

08:23.536 --> 08:24.970
Aren't you gonna open it, Fonz?

08:25.105 --> 08:26.436
No, I ain't gonna open it.

08:26.573 --> 08:28.007
It ain't Christmas yet.

08:28.141 --> 08:29.472
Yeah, but you could
at least take off

08:29.609 --> 08:31.737
the brown wrapping paper,
you know, and see who it's from.

08:31.878 --> 08:33.039
I know who it's from.

08:33.179 --> 08:34.169
It's from my old man.

08:34.313 --> 08:35.975
You want some hot chocolate?

08:36.116 --> 08:37.743
No, thanks.

08:37.884 --> 08:39.443
- Your father?
- Yeah.

08:39.586 --> 08:40.451
That's really something.

08:40.587 --> 08:42.248
- That's great.
- Why?

08:42.389 --> 08:43.982
Well, 'cause you haven't
seen him since you were

08:44.124 --> 08:46.058
three years old, and then,
you know, all of a sudden,

08:46.192 --> 08:47.057
he shows up and...

08:47.193 --> 08:48.092
That's right.

08:48.228 --> 08:49.389
He shows up,
he gives me a package.

08:49.529 --> 08:51.088
He thinks this is gonna
make up for everything.

08:51.231 --> 08:52.357
(laughs)

08:52.499 --> 08:54.126
Well, I don't believe
your father thinks

08:54.267 --> 08:55.428
it's gonna make up for anything.

08:55.568 --> 08:57.434
You know, you're right,
you're right, Rich.

08:57.570 --> 08:58.503
It ain't gonna
make up for nothing.

08:58.638 --> 08:59.696
This could be filled
with diamonds,

08:59.839 --> 09:01.136
it ain't gonna
make up for nothing.

09:01.274 --> 09:02.708
Fonz, the man
is still your father.

09:02.842 --> 09:04.332
My father?!

09:04.477 --> 09:06.070
That's what I think
of my father!

09:06.212 --> 09:07.577
He should rot in Singapore!

09:07.714 --> 09:09.876
That's in the Orient.

09:15.288 --> 09:17.279
<i>II</i>

09:24.197 --> 09:27.189
Yep, Yep-

09:30.870 --> 09:32.736
Just tell me the truth;
you're mad.

09:32.872 --> 09:34.135
I am not mad.

09:34.274 --> 09:35.469
I can tell you are.

09:35.608 --> 09:36.632
I am not mad.

09:36.776 --> 09:37.800
You look mad.

09:37.944 --> 09:38.911
- Hey, Rich.
- Do you mind?

09:39.045 --> 09:39.910
We're having an argument here.

09:40.046 --> 09:41.639
We are not having an argument.

09:41.781 --> 09:43.408
Uh, what are you
not arguing about?

09:43.550 --> 09:45.416
Oh, didn't we make an agreement

09:45.552 --> 09:47.782
about the amount we were
gonna spend on gifts?

09:47.921 --> 09:49.411
Yeah, we set a limit
for the gifts.

09:49.556 --> 09:50.648
Yeah, it was Rich's idea.

09:50.790 --> 09:52.087
What? He didn't go over
the limit, did he?

09:52.225 --> 09:55.195
Well, he did with my gift, and I
stuck to the limit on his gift,

09:55.328 --> 09:57.023
and now I feel like
a real cheapo.

09:57.163 --> 09:59.063
I went a little bit
over the limit.

09:59.199 --> 10:00.598
Oh, Rich.

10:00.733 --> 10:02.599
This is from
Pfister's jewelry store.

10:02.735 --> 10:05.067
The box alone is over the limit.

10:05.205 --> 10:07.173
Wait a minute.
Now, give the kid a break.

10:07.307 --> 10:08.536
- Yeah.
- He's working.

10:08.675 --> 10:10.268
He just wanted to spend
a little more money

10:10.410 --> 10:12.469
on the people
that mean the most to him.

10:12.612 --> 10:14.944
Yeah, Rich. How much more
did you spend on us?

10:16.983 --> 10:19.111
Well, with you guys,
I stayed within the limit.

10:19.252 --> 10:20.447
RALPH and POTSIE:
Aw.

10:20.587 --> 10:23.488
See, Rich? People's feelings
are gonna get hurt.

10:23.623 --> 10:25.091
All right, now,
this has gone far enough.

10:25.225 --> 10:26.454
- Now he's yelling at us.
- Yeah.

10:26.593 --> 10:28.220
You see that?
You're both angry at me.

10:28.361 --> 10:29.419
We're not angry.

10:29.562 --> 10:31.291
Come on, Pots, let's go
to the department store

10:31.431 --> 10:34.025
and see if Santa Claus will give
us a list of bad little girls.

10:34.167 --> 10:36.329
Yeah.

10:36.469 --> 10:38.494
I hope your Christmas stocking
has a hole in it!

10:38.638 --> 10:40.402
- Potsie.
- See what you did now.

10:40.540 --> 10:41.803
Wait, Lori Beth...

10:41.941 --> 10:45.309
You know, Rich, it's not easy
being your girlfriend.

10:48.181 --> 10:51.446
I try so hard.

10:51.584 --> 10:53.552
Busy, busy, busy-

10:58.825 --> 11:00.657
Rich, I'm having a problem.
I need your help.

11:00.793 --> 11:02.659
- Yeah, Fonz?
- I got these two ties.

11:02.795 --> 11:05.787
See, I don't know which one
your father would like better.

11:09.469 --> 11:10.834
It's a toughie, Fonz.

11:10.970 --> 11:14.065
Uh, but I-l think this one would
go better with his blue suit.

11:14.207 --> 11:15.072
- You do?
- Yeah.

11:15.208 --> 11:16.539
I'll keep this one for your dad.

11:16.676 --> 11:17.973
- I'll give this one to Al.
- Oh.

11:18.111 --> 11:21.911
I bet you it reminds him
of Rosa, anyway, huh?

11:22.048 --> 11:23.982
Hey, what do you got in there?

11:24.117 --> 11:26.017
Uh, federal offense, Fonz.

11:26.152 --> 11:27.620

Oh.

11:27.754 --> 11:29.188
So, uh, Fonz?

11:29.322 --> 11:30.756
Yeah.

11:30.890 --> 11:33.416
Open that present
from your father yet?

11:33.560 --> 11:34.584
Something I said?

11:37.630 --> 11:39.064
I want to tell you something.

11:39.199 --> 11:40.667
You don't mention that again,
all right?

11:40.800 --> 11:42.393
We're gonna forget that
right now, right?

11:42.535 --> 11:44.401
- Yeah, but, Fonz...
- I said we're gonna

11:44.537 --> 11:45.698
forget that right now,
all right?

11:45.838 --> 11:46.703
Forget what?

11:46.839 --> 11:48.534
Oh. See that-that's great.

11:48.675 --> 11:51.610

I don't care what you think.

12:06.559 --> 12:08.653
I don't care

is over now, you understand?

- Yeah, Fonz.

this afternoon.

15:28.694 --> 15:30.753

17:56.108 --> 17:57.735
There's no mistake, Fonz.

17:57.877 --> 18:00.005

19:08.247 --> 19:09.408
I-It's nothing.
Don't worry about it.

19:09.548 --> 19:10.982
RICHIE:
It is, too, something, Fonz.

19:11.117 --> 19:13.381
And you can't keep ignoring it.
This is your father!

19:13.519 --> 19:14.884
He's my father.
Then why didn't he stay?

19:15.021 --> 19:16.750
Why didn't he talk to me?
Why'd he walk out

19:16.889 --> 19:19.017
when I was three years old?
I didn't even get a chance

19:19.158 --> 19:20.887
to see his face real good.

19:21.027 --> 19:22.290
He hates me. That's it.

19:22.428 --> 19:23.520
Oh, Arthur!

19:23.663 --> 19:25.825
No, no, no, don't worry
about it. I accept it.

19:25.965 --> 19:28.525
Walked out on me 'cause he hates
my guts. It's all right.

19:28.668 --> 19:32.866
I didn't even get a chance
to see his face real good.

19:33.005 --> 19:34.996
<i>II</i>

19:39.478 --> 19:40.707
Now, wait a minute, Richard.

19:40.846 --> 19:42.280
- That's Fonz...
- Dad, I've been hearing

19:42.415 --> 19:45.407
about Fonzie's father
ever since I met him.

19:47.086 --> 19:49.521
Fonzie, I want to know
what you're afraid of.

19:49.655 --> 19:51.521
I'm not afraid of anything.

19:51.657 --> 19:54.490
You want to read it, read it.

19:54.627 --> 19:56.288
All right.

20:00.633 --> 20:03.830
"I was a merchant seaman
when I met your ma."

20:04.870 --> 20:06.861
My ma.

20:08.708 --> 20:12.941
"I thought I could settle down
like everybody else.

20:13.079 --> 20:14.911
"Maybe it was my fault.

20:15.047 --> 20:16.742
"I don't know.

20:16.882 --> 20:19.044
"It just didn't work out.

20:20.720 --> 20:24.020
"I can't stay
in one place too long.

20:24.156 --> 20:27.148
"I know it's not much
of an explanation, but...

20:27.293 --> 20:31.025
that's the way it was."

20:31.163 --> 20:33.723
And signed:
"Your father...

20:33.866 --> 20:35.994
Vito Fonzarelli."

20:40.239 --> 20:42.708
Oh, Arthur, your father...

20:42.842 --> 20:44.776
Father? You call that a father?

20:44.910 --> 20:47.072
Oh, Howard, now,
don't be too hard on him.

20:47.213 --> 20:49.773
- He explained... -He didn't
explain anything, Marion.

20:49.915 --> 20:51.815
- Dad...
- Look, Richard,

20:51.951 --> 20:55.080
every man comes to that moment
when he wants to run away

20:55.221 --> 20:56.746
from everything he's got

20:56.889 --> 20:59.415
and go bum around
through the Seven Seas.

20:59.558 --> 21:01.083
But most of them don't.

21:01.227 --> 21:03.161
Howard, will you
just try to understand?

21:03.295 --> 21:04.660
I do understand, Marion.

21:04.797 --> 21:06.993
I understand that there's
something called responsibility,

21:07.133 --> 21:09.693
and this man
just couldn't face up to his.

21:10.736 --> 21:12.329
I'm sorry, Fonzie,

21:12.471 --> 21:16.567
I know it's none of my business,
but that's the way I feel.

21:17.743 --> 21:19.233
Whoa!

21:23.315 --> 21:25.784
- I feel great.
- You what?

21:25.918 --> 21:28.114
- Feel great?
- I feel great.

21:28.254 --> 21:29.847
See, I understand now.

21:29.989 --> 21:32.856
Uh, what you're talking here.
It's not my fault.

21:32.992 --> 21:34.721
You see, I thought
it was my fault.

21:34.860 --> 21:37.295
I thought I did something wrong
that made him leave, you know?

21:37.429 --> 21:39.693
But, Fonzie,
you were just a kid!

21:39.832 --> 21:41.493
Yeah, I know.
I thought I did something wrong,

21:41.634 --> 21:43.227
you know, like getting born.

21:44.336 --> 21:46.361
But I don't feel
so much hate anymore.

21:46.505 --> 21:47.631
You know what I mean?

21:47.773 --> 21:50.333
I understand what
you were talking about.

21:50.476 --> 21:52.342
Couldn't help himself.

21:52.478 --> 21:54.537
It's all right.
Some people are like that.

21:54.680 --> 21:58.446
You know how good it feels
not to hate anymore?

21:58.584 --> 22:00.575
It feels good.

22:03.823 --> 22:05.222
JOANIE:
Well, open your present.

22:05.357 --> 22:06.654
Well, now, now, wait a minute.

22:06.792 --> 22:08.487
He may want
to open that in private.

22:08.627 --> 22:10.391
No, no, wait a minute.
I'm with family here.

22:10.529 --> 22:12.293
- I'll open my present.
- Oh, I'll help you.

22:12.431 --> 22:14.456
- RICHIE: Right, your family.
- FONZIE: Whoo!

22:14.600 --> 22:17.001
- JOANIE: Oh...
- All right, let's see here.

22:17.136 --> 22:18.934
MARION:
Oh...

22:23.142 --> 22:25.406
This is from Singapore,
you know.

22:25.544 --> 22:26.477
Oh.

22:26.612 --> 22:28.102
That's in the Orient.

22:31.917 --> 22:34.545
I happen to think
that this is beautiful.

22:34.687 --> 22:36.849
- Oh, it is. It is beautiful.
- JOANIE: Yeah.

22:36.989 --> 22:38.787
MARION:
Oh, look at that!

22:39.825 --> 22:41.418
(doorbell rings)

22:41.560 --> 22:43.551
Oh, I'll get it, I'll get it.

22:43.696 --> 22:45.790
Oh, Arthur,
that's really beautiful.

22:45.931 --> 22:47.831
- Thank you.
- Just beautiful.

22:47.967 --> 22:50.299
BOTH:
Merry Christmas, Joanie!

22:50.436 --> 22:52.165
Guess what we got you.

22:53.205 --> 22:55.264
ALL:
A Christmas tree.

22:55.407 --> 22:57.774
You told!

22:58.811 --> 23:00.677
Here you are.

23:00.813 --> 23:02.907
JOANIE: Come on in, you guys.
This is good.

23:03.048 --> 23:05.073
Look at this.
Must have been a big sale

23:05.217 --> 23:07.083
-on Christmas trees, huh?
- Yeah.

23:07.219 --> 23:08.914
- That's all right, boys--
there's always room

23:09.054 --> 23:10.681
for another Christmas tree.

23:10.823 --> 23:13.724
Marion, you've got
to stop saying that.

23:13.859 --> 23:16.328
Oh, I was afraid you guys might
really be ticked off at me.

23:16.462 --> 23:18.226
Well, we figured that
friendship means a lot more

23:18.364 --> 23:19.957
than how much
you spend on a present.

23:20.099 --> 23:21.430
- Of course it does.
- Good. -Yeah.

23:21.567 --> 23:23.729
We brought you a present.

23:25.971 --> 23:28.303
Great!

23:28.440 --> 23:30.534
That's great!
A hockey stick.

23:30.676 --> 23:32.201
You told.

23:33.512 --> 23:35.742
-(doorbell rings)
- It couldn't be!

23:35.881 --> 23:37.872
JOANIE:
I can't stand the suspense.

23:40.052 --> 23:42.487
Hi, hi, hi, hi, hi.

23:42.621 --> 23:44.020
MerfV--'

23:44.156 --> 23:46.250

23:46.392 --> 23:49.123
Al, I can always count on you.

23:49.261 --> 23:52.788
(laughs) Oh, this is
the best Christmas, everybody.

23:52.932 --> 23:55.492
- Yeah. I, uh, I love your tie
there, Al. -Thanks, Fonz.

23:55.634 --> 23:58.433
- Yeah. -Al, you seen
Fonzie's Christmas present?

23:58.570 --> 23:59.833
No.

24:00.873 --> 24:02.841
It's, uh, it's from my dad.

24:02.975 --> 24:05.034
- Ah, terrific!
- That's beautiful, Fonz!

24:05.177 --> 24:07.509
-: <i>r</i>

24:13.319 --> 24:15.754
HOWARD: Hey, this'll make
a great picture for the album.

24:15.888 --> 24:17.754
MARION: Uh, Howard,
you can see the tree?

24:18.791 --> 24:19.986
- Yep.
- Oh, dear.

24:20.125 --> 24:22.924
- Now, where's my eggnog?
- Oh, the last time I saw it,

24:23.062 --> 24:25.087
-it was next to
the Christmas tree. -Which one?

24:25.230 --> 24:27.995
- The alumin... yeah, a...
- Yeah, the aluminum.

24:28.133 --> 24:29.726
Marion, stay in the picture.

24:29.868 --> 24:32.303
Now, come on, everybody,
squeeze close together.

24:32.438 --> 24:33.428
POTSIE:
Ouch!

24:33.572 --> 24:35.131
Well, not that close.

24:35.274 --> 24:36.764
Hey, come on, Al, smile.

24:36.909 --> 24:39.435
I am.

24:39.578 --> 24:41.068
We're all set.

24:41.213 --> 24:43.477
Here goes the timer.

24:43.615 --> 24:45.310
Hurry up, Dad, hurry.

24:45.451 --> 24:49.217
I hope this goes fast--
my teeth are drying.

24:50.222 --> 24:51.690
HOWARD:
