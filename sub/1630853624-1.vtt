WEBVTT

02:23.851 --> 02:24.845
Fuck, man.

02:50.342 --> 02:52.246
Goddamn it!

03:04.890 --> 03:07.519
We've had days where we've done
six of these in one day.

03:07.655 --> 03:08.988
Six?
Six of them.

03:09.123 --> 03:13.095
Just me and Matt before--
When he was around more.

03:13.231 --> 03:14.830
Oh, man.
Yeah.

03:14.966 --> 03:18.102
Sometimes people ask me, you
know, "Can I buy half a pig?"

03:18.237 --> 03:19.836
"Can I get some of that?"

03:19.972 --> 03:22.637
So I raise an extra one for a
family member or a close friend.

03:22.773 --> 03:25.411
Right.
And, uh, we make a few bucks.

03:29.242 --> 03:33.115
Now, the absolute
most important thing ever...

03:33.250 --> 03:35.285
is the bile sac.

03:35.420 --> 03:36.584
The bile sac?
Yeah.

03:36.719 --> 03:38.358
If you were
to break that...

03:38.493 --> 03:42.527
It's such--
It's like yellow, ugly shit

03:42.662 --> 03:46.195
that will taint the meat
and make it not edible.

03:46.330 --> 03:47.263
Right.
So you--

03:47.398 --> 03:48.564
It's really critical,

03:48.700 --> 03:50.303
so I don't know
if you feel like it,

03:50.438 --> 03:51.901
but if you don't mind
holding this.

03:52.037 --> 03:52.933
Got you.

03:54.206 --> 03:55.636
Yeah.
Got it?

03:55.772 --> 03:57.503
Yeah, I got it.
We're good.

04:07.682 --> 04:09.422
Sawzall!
Goddamn!

04:11.221 --> 04:14.053
I got it. I got my green shot
right there.

04:14.188 --> 04:18.154
J-rod, motherfucker!
What's up, brother?

04:18.290 --> 04:19.658
How you doing, baby?
It's been a while.

04:19.794 --> 04:20.991
Yeah, man.
Good to see you.

04:21.126 --> 04:23.160
What's up? Merc.
How's it going?

04:23.295 --> 04:25.134
It's good to meet you.
Good to meet you!

04:25.270 --> 04:27.999
You won't believe what he helped
me with. It was fucked up.

04:28.134 --> 04:30.367
It's right there. Try it.

04:30.503 --> 04:33.180
They're serving up the other
ones, the green ones.

04:33.316 --> 04:35.473
No pork on my fork,
but have at it.

04:35.609 --> 04:36.817
Cheers.

04:36.952 --> 04:38.415
To<i> la finca.</i>

04:38.550 --> 04:40.351
What?
<i>La finca,</i> the farm.

04:40.486 --> 04:42.089
<i>La finca.</i>
<i>Salud!</i>

04:42.224 --> 04:44.518
<i>La finca!</i>

04:44.654 --> 04:46.657
I didn't know that one.

04:48.461 --> 04:49.954
So here's the deal.

04:50.089 --> 04:51.959
I just went
into the bathroom...

04:53.001 --> 04:55.836
I swear to God, bro.

04:55.971 --> 04:57.564
I swear this to God.

04:57.700 --> 04:59.571
I go in the bathroom...

04:59.707 --> 05:01.670
to go to the bathroom.
I feel this thing on me--

05:01.806 --> 05:04.040
Number one or number two?
Number one.

05:04.175 --> 05:06.840
I'm feeling this thing on me,
and I'm getting really nervous,

05:06.976 --> 05:09.449
and I'm, like, okay,
it's pretty big.

05:10.346 --> 05:11.316
For real.

05:11.451 --> 05:13.385
Bob, look.
Dude! It was--

05:13.521 --> 05:16.614
I had a bloated tick
on my something!

05:17.950 --> 05:19.326
A what?
A tick!

05:19.461 --> 05:22.060
It was buried in me
on my something.

05:22.195 --> 05:25.565
What's this--? Time-out.
What the fuck is a "some-tine"?

05:25.701 --> 05:27.927
A something.
His freaking "something."

05:28.063 --> 05:29.667
- Your dick?
- Yeah, man.

05:29.802 --> 05:32.368
You had a tick on your dick?
On my dick! I did.

05:32.503 --> 05:34.069
How did you not know this?

05:34.205 --> 05:36.506
I didn't know because they're
pretty cool at what they do.

05:36.642 --> 05:38.537
They're quiet.
They don't go:

05:42.383 --> 05:45.142
Did you, would you, could you?

05:45.278 --> 05:47.553
I'm, like, oh, my God.
Oh, yeah, Bob.

05:51.625 --> 05:54.425
So far, so good. We good, man.
Yeah.

05:54.560 --> 05:56.756
Goddamn, Bob.
Goddamn, man.

05:56.892 --> 05:59.228
You high, man?
Yeah. Yeah.

06:03.272 --> 06:05.237
Hi, this is, uh,
Mercury Maxwell.

06:05.373 --> 06:06.634
I'm staying down at the house.

06:06.770 --> 06:07.868
I just wanted to let you know

06:08.003 --> 06:10.602
that we had a tree
fall down today.

06:10.737 --> 06:12.238
And, uh...

06:12.374 --> 06:15.944
it's in the backyard,
but give me a call when you can.

06:20.350 --> 06:21.845
Shit!

07:08.902 --> 07:11.670
What up? What up?
It's your boy, Money Merc.

07:11.805 --> 07:15.839
Live from the middle
of the fucking woods...

07:15.975 --> 07:19.170
working on this new album
right quick, man.

07:19.305 --> 07:21.243
Don't know where the fuck
I'm at,

07:21.378 --> 07:23.514
at an undisclosed location,
but let me show y'all, though.

07:23.650 --> 07:26.843
Hold on. Let me see...
Unh...

07:26.978 --> 07:28.016
Out here, baby.

07:29.921 --> 07:31.954
Out here.
What you know about that?

07:34.456 --> 07:36.725
Nah, I ain't no country boy,
but it's cool out here though.

07:36.860 --> 07:38.223
I'm fucking with it.
Like I said,

07:38.359 --> 07:40.533
I'm just getting
some new vibes for the album.

07:40.669 --> 07:44.369
You know, new shit going down.
Don't even trip.

07:44.504 --> 07:46.632
"When can I come to Brazil?"

07:46.768 --> 07:48.432
Shit, anytime.

07:49.576 --> 07:51.143
Y'all got that ass in Brazil.

07:51.279 --> 07:53.175
You already know, shit.

07:53.311 --> 07:57.348
"I'm a 14-year-old rapper
with sick beats and hard rhymes.

07:57.484 --> 08:00.345
Shout me out, Lil' Stank."

08:00.480 --> 08:02.689
Lil' Stank, that's your name,
my nigga?

08:02.824 --> 08:05.823
Do you shit on yourself?
Do you wear diapers, mofo?

08:05.958 --> 08:07.858
What the fuck is a Lil' Stank?

08:08.957 --> 08:10.256
I'm fucking with it though.

08:10.391 --> 08:13.964
Keep grinding though.
Go check out Lil' Stank.

08:14.099 --> 08:16.736
"You soft as hell.
Just telling you how it is."

08:16.872 --> 08:19.536
You bitch-ass nigga.
Where the fuck you from, man?

08:19.671 --> 08:21.575
Ohio or some shit like that?

08:22.805 --> 08:24.909
Monkey-ass nigga, man.

08:25.045 --> 08:27.380
Motherfuckers always coming in
here, talking shit,

08:27.516 --> 08:28.976
but it's crazy
'cause when y'all

08:29.112 --> 08:30.578
see a motherfucker
on the street,

08:30.714 --> 08:32.548
it'd be all smiles.

08:32.684 --> 08:34.379
But it's all good though.

08:34.514 --> 08:39.586
"Lil' AK-47 son'd you
in the new video."

08:39.721 --> 08:42.356
Fuck AK-47, man!

08:42.492 --> 08:46.025
How the fuck AK-47 son'd me
and I'm the father of this shit?

08:46.161 --> 08:48.301
Man can't "son" me.

08:48.436 --> 08:50.230
Nigga's a bitch. Fuck blood.

08:51.738 --> 08:53.466
It's all good, man.

08:53.601 --> 08:55.869
I ain't got to respond
to bitch-ass niggas like that.

08:56.005 --> 08:57.543
Like I said, album on the way,

08:57.679 --> 09:00.207
we flaming that fuck-boy
on every track.

09:00.343 --> 09:02.582
It's going down.
I ain't worried about shit.

09:02.717 --> 09:04.548
You already know
how Blood Money Merc do

09:04.684 --> 09:06.847
when I get in that mode, so...

09:06.983 --> 09:09.623
It is what it is. Anyway, man.

09:09.758 --> 09:12.791
Album on the way, man.
I'm checking out. Peace.

09:25.733 --> 09:28.433
Okay, fine. I got it.
I'm going on break.

09:30.774 --> 09:33.108
Hey, yo! Excuse me. Shit.

09:35.384 --> 09:37.013
Can you help me?
Sure.

09:38.812 --> 09:41.981
I got a leak in the kitchen
of this house I'm renting,

09:42.117 --> 09:44.516
and, uh...
I need a P-trap,

09:44.651 --> 09:49.025
and I don't know
if I need "1 1/4" or "1 1/2".

09:49.161 --> 09:51.824
Okay, I think--
It's for the kitchen, so...

09:51.959 --> 09:53.360
It could be either.

09:53.495 --> 09:55.592
I think it just depends
on the sink.
Oh, shit.

09:55.727 --> 09:57.770
I should have brought
the pipe in here.

09:58.570 --> 09:59.838
Um...

10:01.635 --> 10:04.874
You can get both and return
whatever you don't use.

10:05.010 --> 10:06.504
Yeah,
I guess I got to do that.

10:11.477 --> 10:13.276
My husband's a logger.
He uses these.

10:13.411 --> 10:15.288
Yeah?
You a logger?

10:15.424 --> 10:17.152
Eh, not quite.
Okay.

10:19.720 --> 10:20.793
Hm.

10:21.923 --> 10:23.158
You look familiar.

10:24.422 --> 10:27.467
Were you in the movies?
Nah.

10:27.602 --> 10:30.264
TV?
Nah. Actually...

10:31.663 --> 10:34.370
I make music. I'm a rapper.
Oh, really?

10:34.505 --> 10:35.971
Yeah.

10:36.107 --> 10:37.974
Can I ask you a question?
What's that?

10:38.110 --> 10:40.847
What's the difference
between hip-hop and rap?

10:40.982 --> 10:45.643
Uh, like rap is like the music,
the sub-genre of it,

10:45.778 --> 10:49.480
and hip-hop is like
the whole culture, I guess.

10:49.615 --> 10:53.589
So hip-hop is more
like the young kids do

10:53.725 --> 10:57.095
and rap is for seasoned?

10:57.231 --> 11:01.592
Um, I mean, I don't really think
it has an age bracket on it.

11:01.728 --> 11:04.103
Think everybody
kind of loves it, you know?

11:04.238 --> 11:05.332
Okay.

11:06.741 --> 11:08.300
Jill,
could you switch with Sue?

11:08.435 --> 11:10.535
Like, just change spots.
All right.

11:12.538 --> 11:14.341
That is significantly
better.

11:15.607 --> 11:18.417
Everyone smile.
Okay, good.

11:18.553 --> 11:21.414
Three, two, one.
Cheese!

11:31.793 --> 11:35.726

11:35.862 --> 11:38.904

<i>You didn't kill that pig.</i>
I did.

12:13.104 --> 12:15.541
The nigga asked me to help him

12:15.676 --> 12:17.102
slaughter the pig and I did it.

12:17.238 --> 12:19.076
What the fuck? It wasn't shit.

12:19.212 --> 12:21.105
I thought it was gonna be
a big deal, but it wasn't.

12:21.240 --> 12:23.575
It actually was easy.

12:23.710 --> 12:25.918
<i>All right.</i>
<i>Well, whatever it takes.</i>

12:26.053 --> 12:27.646

12:39.296 --> 12:41.694
Ain't no motherfucking
timeline, nigga.

12:41.830 --> 12:44.629
How are you going to tell me
you're gonna give me a month?

12:45.906 --> 12:47.469
Y'all can't rush this shit,
man.

12:47.605 --> 12:50.340
Y'all keep always trying to turn
a motherfucker creativity

12:50.475 --> 12:53.143
on and off like a light switch.
It don't work like that.

12:54.142 --> 12:55.615
You know what I'm saying?

12:55.751 --> 12:56.815
I'm tired--
<i>I hear you.</i>

12:56.950 --> 12:58.476
I'm tired of this rap shit
anyway.

12:58.611 --> 13:00.285
What if I don't
turn the album in?

13:00.421 --> 13:01.545
<i>No, no.</i>

13:01.681 --> 13:03.179
What if I don't even
turn the album in?

13:03.315 --> 13:05.153
They gonna sue me?

13:05.289 --> 13:08.118
<i>The label's a bitch,</i>
<i>right?</i>

13:08.253 --> 13:10.990
<i>But it's a bitch we both got</i>

13:11.126 --> 13:12.459
<i>Let me handle them.</i>

13:12.594 --> 13:14.599
<i>Don't be even thinking</i>

13:14.735 --> 13:16.034

13:31.448 --> 13:32.710
<i>The whole point</i>

13:32.845 --> 13:35.179

<i>I know.</i>

14:35.749 --> 14:37.577
I'm surprised. You just...

14:38.854 --> 14:40.014
You know,
when you were little,

14:40.150 --> 14:42.285
I had to drag you outdoors.

14:44.192 --> 14:47.320
What am I going to do
in the projects of Chicago,

14:47.455 --> 14:49.292
go outside and get shot?
Yeah.

14:51.128 --> 14:52.724
This is a little different.

14:54.529 --> 14:56.266
Yeah, it's definitely
different.

14:57.732 --> 14:59.731
Just good to get
some fresh air, you know?

15:01.141 --> 15:03.976
Kind of hit mute
on everything.
Mm-hm.

15:04.112 --> 15:06.345
Nobody out here,
not a nigga in sight.

15:08.207 --> 15:11.509
Only thing you got to worry
about out here is them bears.

15:11.644 --> 15:14.411
What bears?
Bears all around.

15:14.547 --> 15:15.812
What, here?
Yeah.

15:15.947 --> 15:18.089
You said you wanted
to go on a hike.

15:18.225 --> 15:20.323
But you didn't say nothing
about no bears!

15:20.458 --> 15:23.789
Nah, don't hold me.
If a bear get on you, hey...

15:23.924 --> 15:26.063
Hey, Mama, I love you,
but if a bear jump out,

15:26.199 --> 15:28.292
it's every man for themselves.
Uh-uh.

15:28.428 --> 15:30.628
I know you got my back.

15:30.764 --> 15:32.568
Seriously,
there are no bears out here.

15:32.703 --> 15:35.801
If they come out, just ball up
in the fetal position.

15:35.936 --> 15:38.137
Then they won't-- They might
not do nothing to you.

15:38.272 --> 15:39.139
That's what I heard.

15:39.274 --> 15:40.805
Bob tell you that?
Nah.

15:44.576 --> 15:46.680
All right, so is it hot?

15:46.815 --> 15:48.950
I'mma put some of these onions
in if it's hot.

15:49.085 --> 15:50.550
I don't like onions.

15:50.685 --> 15:53.683
But you need them,
so let's run with it.

15:53.818 --> 15:55.325
Since when don't you
like onions?

15:55.460 --> 15:57.222
It ain't my thing.
I don't like the texture.

15:57.357 --> 15:58.857
You've eaten onions.

15:58.992 --> 16:01.000
You don't even know
when the onions are in there.

16:01.136 --> 16:03.194
I don't like the texture
of onion.
Back up.

16:03.330 --> 16:05.571
Back it on up!

16:05.707 --> 16:06.973
Back up. All right.

16:07.109 --> 16:09.570
I'm just gonna put
half the onions in here.

16:09.706 --> 16:11.570
Okay.
Just 'cause I don't
wanna hear it.

16:11.706 --> 16:14.640
It's your world.
It's your world, shawty.

16:14.776 --> 16:18.084
Yes. It's my world.
It's your world.

16:23.449 --> 16:26.325
BLOGGER
<i>He's a bitch!</i>
<i>He's a bitch-made bitch.</i>

16:26.460 --> 16:29.526
<i>If that album says anything</i>
<i>about fucking drugs,</i>

16:29.661 --> 16:32.891

16:37.167 --> 16:38.297
<i>Come to the fucking hood.</i>

16:38.432 --> 16:40.065
Come on, Mama. What's up?

16:40.200 --> 16:42.999
<i>If you're a fan of his,</i>
<i>comment down below. Whatever.</i>

16:52.754 --> 16:54.887
Where you on your way to?

16:55.022 --> 16:57.514
I'mma stop back down
at Aunty's

16:57.650 --> 17:00.785
and, uh, pick my stuff up,

17:00.920 --> 17:04.396
then I'm gonna head on
back to my house.

17:05.766 --> 17:07.093
Good old Evanston.

17:08.836 --> 17:10.533
Who could've thought?

17:10.668 --> 17:13.572
Ain't got a lot of our kind
out there, that's for sure.

17:13.707 --> 17:15.064
I love my house,

17:15.200 --> 17:18.144
and I love the new people
I'm getting to...

17:19.275 --> 17:21.778
That's good. That's good.

17:21.913 --> 17:23.744
Surprised?

17:23.880 --> 17:26.515
Everybody need a change
of scenery from time to time.

17:32.159 --> 17:34.220
How many Black farmers
you know?

17:34.355 --> 17:36.227
None.
Exactly.

17:36.362 --> 17:39.097
How many Black people you know
producing and,

17:39.233 --> 17:42.762
you know,
cultivating their own food?

17:43.839 --> 17:44.868
None.
There ain't a lot.

17:45.003 --> 17:47.432
No.
Exactly.

17:47.568 --> 17:50.041
You know?
Look at you.

17:50.176 --> 17:52.145
Just a thought, you know?
Just--

18:08.958 --> 18:09.855
Bob?

18:12.431 --> 18:14.299
Big Bob, what up, playboy?
- Merc!

18:16.302 --> 18:17.797
I don't know, man.
I'm beat.

18:19.307 --> 18:21.338
What's going on?
How you doing, man?

18:21.473 --> 18:23.275
Good. I'm chilling.
Good to see you.

18:23.410 --> 18:25.639
I don't know, man,
just having a tough morning.

18:25.775 --> 18:27.773
Got so many animals,
it's driving me nuts.

18:27.909 --> 18:29.776
I got cows,
three of them had babies.

18:29.912 --> 18:31.849
I got to have three more.
They'll go any minute.

18:31.984 --> 18:33.584
I got 16 turkeys.

18:33.720 --> 18:36.616
I got 35 broiler chickens
I got to hang up on Monday.

18:36.752 --> 18:41.327
I got laying hens...
and some doves.

18:41.462 --> 18:43.758
And then I got to find some way
to go up the road

18:43.894 --> 18:47.200
and cut 25 trees on the ground
to make some money.

18:47.335 --> 18:49.698
That sound like a lot shit, man.
Need some help?

18:49.834 --> 18:52.469
You don't have to help me.
You helped me last week.

18:54.404 --> 18:55.905
I know, man, but, you know,

18:57.474 --> 18:59.741
I'mma be here for a minute,
so...

18:59.877 --> 19:02.906
I figured I might as well, you
know, come give you a hand.

19:03.042 --> 19:05.209
My grandfather used
to have farmland.

19:05.344 --> 19:07.682
I'd be lying to you if I said
I wasn't interested in it.

19:07.817 --> 19:11.851
So, you know, me helping you
is like helping me.

19:13.652 --> 19:14.689
What you say?

19:19.326 --> 19:20.996
The fuck?

19:21.131 --> 19:23.929
You got to help me get this
in these buckets.

19:24.064 --> 19:27.167
Or this bucket, anyway.
Man, what is this shit?

19:27.302 --> 19:28.373
Pig food, man.

19:30.605 --> 19:31.704
Pig food?
I know,

19:31.840 --> 19:33.708
it's too good for them, huh?

19:38.278 --> 19:43.988
You got bagels, French toast,
Ring Dings. You kidding me?

19:44.124 --> 19:45.548
Honey buns.
Yodels.

19:48.458 --> 19:50.527
Pancakes.
Pancakes?

19:50.662 --> 19:53.060
Fucking pancakes, dude. Yeah.
That's crazy.

19:53.195 --> 19:54.091
Yeah.

19:55.568 --> 19:57.301
Throwing away all this
good shit, man.

19:57.436 --> 19:59.569
I know, but at least
it's outdated.

19:59.705 --> 20:03.766
And nobody gets to use it
'cause they can't sell it.

20:03.902 --> 20:05.244
As soon as it's one day old,

20:05.379 --> 20:07.311
they say, no,
you got to get rid of it.

20:07.447 --> 20:09.405
I've been lucky
for almost a year now,

20:09.541 --> 20:11.907
getting this from them, and
they're going out of business.

20:12.043 --> 20:14.783
Outdated?
Yeah, it sucks.

20:14.918 --> 20:17.290
Tastes good though, right?
Tastes all right to me.

20:22.355 --> 20:24.225
All right, motherfuckers!
Let's get it. Let's get it.

20:24.361 --> 20:25.989
Oink, oink, oink, oink.

20:26.125 --> 20:27.627
Motherfucker!
Oink, motherfucker.

20:27.763 --> 20:29.100

20:29.236 --> 20:31.199
Come on. Let's get this shit.

20:31.334 --> 20:32.869
There we go, yeah!

20:33.004 --> 20:34.439

20:34.575 --> 20:37.470
Come on. Fuck with me.
Fuck with me. Oink, oink.

20:40.079 --> 20:40.973
Motherfucker!

20:46.918 --> 20:48.652
Sounds like the turkeys
are liking you too.

20:48.788 --> 20:50.884
Bacon, motherfucker.
I want some turkey bacon next!

20:51.020 --> 20:53.820
They're liking it.
You got to give me new shoes.

20:53.955 --> 20:55.955

23:36.781 --> 23:38.121

Yeah. All right.

28:40.728 --> 28:43.424
You shitting me, dude,
with this?

28:43.559 --> 28:46.392
What is this shit, bro? No.
What you doing at my house?

28:47.935 --> 28:50.568
The fuck you doing here?
What the fuck is this?

28:50.704 --> 28:51.932
What?
What is this tweet?

28:52.068 --> 28:53.767
You don't do this on your own.

28:53.903 --> 28:54.968
You got high last night?

28:55.104 --> 28:56.201
Fucked up?
Do it on my own?

28:56.337 --> 28:57.800
What the fuck
you talking about?

28:57.935 --> 29:00.240
You consult with me.
That's why I'm calling you.

29:00.376 --> 29:01.978
Consult? I don't have
to consult shit.

29:02.114 --> 29:03.706
Who the fuck you think
you talking to?

29:03.842 --> 29:06.110
You see my name on your phone,
you don't answer--

29:06.246 --> 29:07.609
Who the fuck you talking to?

29:07.745 --> 29:09.753
Who the fuck you talking to?
Fuck yourself.

29:09.889 --> 29:11.754
What? Fuck, what?
Fuck you, man.

29:11.890 --> 29:13.221
Fuck you, man.
Fuck, what?

29:13.356 --> 29:14.789
Fuck you, motherfucker.
Fuck what?
Come on!

29:14.924 --> 29:16.057
Let's go! I'm right here!

29:16.193 --> 29:17.487
I'll smoke
your motherfucking ass.

29:17.623 --> 29:18.794
Watch who the fuck
you talking to.

29:18.930 --> 29:20.965
I ain't afraid of you.

29:21.101 --> 29:23.302
You can put your hands on me,
do whatever you want.

29:23.437 --> 29:25.370
I'm not gonna leave.

29:25.505 --> 29:26.872
I'm here for you, bro!

29:28.941 --> 29:31.038
I hate to say it.
I hate to see it.

29:31.173 --> 29:32.669
You're going to lose
everything.

29:34.141 --> 29:35.540
I'm here for your houses.

29:37.316 --> 29:40.545
You live on credit, like the
rest of these motherfuckers do.

29:43.156 --> 29:46.683
I'm here for your car.
I'm here for your mom's house.

29:46.818 --> 29:49.323
We worked so fucking hard
to get that house!

29:52.165 --> 29:55.294
Now, I'm not supposed
to bring this up but, yo,

29:55.430 --> 29:57.430
you got child support
payments, bro.

29:59.568 --> 30:02.667
Where's your shit? I'm saying,
send me a dummy track.

30:02.803 --> 30:05.935
Send me something stupid,
just so I can satiate them,

30:06.071 --> 30:09.178
just so they'll calm down.
They're breathing down my neck.

30:09.313 --> 30:12.182
Then I wake up, and fucking,
yo, "I'm quitting,

30:12.317 --> 30:14.480
I'm never fucking coming back,"
whatever this fucking--

30:16.256 --> 30:18.889
I got the press calling me
and I can't even talk to you?

30:19.025 --> 30:20.892
I can't even get you
on the phone to say:

30:21.027 --> 30:24.029
"What is this about?
How do I explain this?"

30:24.164 --> 30:26.761
You're lucky I didn't put out
a statement on your behalf

30:26.897 --> 30:28.428
without consulting you.

30:35.907 --> 30:38.603
Take your time. But deliver.

30:40.046 --> 30:41.843
You got to focus.
You have a goal here.

30:41.978 --> 30:43.344
That's why we're up here.

30:43.480 --> 30:46.584
I know you're not up here
for the weather, bro.

30:46.720 --> 30:48.379
Whatever, you made a friend.

30:48.514 --> 30:50.186
Good, I'm glad
you made a friend.

30:51.858 --> 30:53.893
But that's a distraction
right now.

30:57.789 --> 30:59.525
If you ain't Money Merc,
who are you?

31:06.364 --> 31:07.665
I'm hungry as fuck.

31:12.073 --> 31:13.173
I'm going inside.

31:13.308 --> 31:15.712
I'm gonna get myself
a sandwich.

31:15.847 --> 31:17.080
And we got to sit down

31:17.216 --> 31:19.083
and fucking talk
about this shit, dude.

31:46.041 --> 31:48.174
Thanks.
Mm-hm.

31:48.310 --> 31:49.774
He's a big boy.
Thank you.

31:49.909 --> 31:52.410
He can do whatever he wants.
- Oh, no, thank you.

31:52.546 --> 31:54.144
How old are you, Bob, 86?
Yeah.

31:55.516 --> 31:57.316
Come on, man.
Don't push it, bro.

31:57.452 --> 32:00.916
I'm turning 71 next week.
Damn.

32:01.052 --> 32:03.326
Yeah, you want to look like
this when you're 71?

32:03.461 --> 32:05.425
You ain't gonna look like this.
You're right.

32:05.560 --> 32:06.763
You'll be an old,
fat motherfucker.

32:06.898 --> 32:08.131
Leave him alone, Bob.

32:08.267 --> 32:09.902
No, let me just say something
right here.

32:10.037 --> 32:12.165
When I turn 98,
I hope I look just like you.

32:12.300 --> 32:14.337
All right?
You look good.

32:14.472 --> 32:17.440
You ever see anything like this?
What are you showing us?

32:19.471 --> 32:20.937
You know what I'm saying?

32:21.072 --> 32:22.740
Sexy Bob.
This is Bob.
He can't help himself.

32:22.875 --> 32:24.850
Cheers to Bob.
It's for the sake of the party.

32:24.986 --> 32:26.616
I don't want to be a spoiled...
To Bob.

32:26.751 --> 32:27.646

45:22.927 --> 45:25.626
Yo, that was dope,
but we should--

45:25.762 --> 45:27.361
Let's try and do some...

45:27.497 --> 45:29.460
'Cause that shit sounds
like your last record.
Hm?

45:29.595 --> 45:31.895
I'm just saying that--
What you're rapping about.

45:32.030 --> 45:33.471
My last record?

45:33.607 --> 45:35.198
Yeah.
When was your last?

45:35.334 --> 45:36.640
That beat is good. It's okay,

45:36.775 --> 45:38.237
but really,
I'm making the beat.

45:38.372 --> 45:40.641
I'm doing what I'm doing to--
I mean...

45:40.776 --> 45:42.409
I'm enhancing you.

45:42.545 --> 45:45.413
My last record.
When was your last shit?

45:45.549 --> 45:47.077
It's only...

45:47.212 --> 45:48.950
Really?
I mean...

45:49.086 --> 45:50.981
That's where
we're going with it?

45:51.116 --> 45:53.054
I'm just saying, like,

45:53.189 --> 45:55.321
let's do something
that's a little different.

45:57.589 --> 45:59.355
Nigga, you're just
like all these--

45:59.490 --> 46:01.163
We could just...
We could, I mean--

46:01.298 --> 46:03.659
All y'all motherfuckin'
white boys in the industry

46:03.795 --> 46:06.665
always trying to make
a nigga change his style.

46:06.800 --> 46:08.136
I mean...

46:08.271 --> 46:10.206
The fuck going on, man?
That's dope too, but--

46:10.341 --> 46:12.634
Why you want me to change
my motherfucking style, nigga?

46:12.770 --> 46:14.812
The shit that got me here
got me here.

46:14.947 --> 46:18.840
I'm saying, we just go,
like, a little left.

46:18.975 --> 46:21.714
Maybe we need to go a little
different on the beats.

46:21.850 --> 46:23.317
Well, you know...

46:23.452 --> 46:25.654
Like you said, man,
niggas trying to make hits.

46:25.789 --> 46:29.926
Yeah, but, I mean, hits...

46:30.061 --> 46:32.358
You know, hits ain't coming
from the same--

46:32.494 --> 46:35.757
We can't follow the same
formula and then it's a hit.

46:35.893 --> 46:38.864
You know? You already had hits.
It's the same shit.

46:39.000 --> 46:40.266
The shit I've been doing

46:40.402 --> 46:41.963
been putting them plaques
on the wall.

46:42.099 --> 46:46.004
All right.
The cars in the
motherfucking driveway.

46:46.139 --> 46:47.668
The houses on the lot.

46:47.804 --> 46:50.045
You got me fucked up, Leon.
I'm out.

46:50.181 --> 46:53.343
Show your way out, dawg.
You got some weed?

46:53.478 --> 46:54.781
I got weed.
Get the fuck out.

46:54.916 --> 46:56.151
Get the fuck out.

47:05.558 --> 47:07.591
I don't feel like rapping
right now, dawg.

47:09.001 --> 47:10.759
I just need some space
from that shit.

47:13.871 --> 47:15.401
I don't know, maybe when...

47:18.342 --> 47:20.879
I don't know. I don't know.
Just right now, I'm...

47:22.647 --> 47:23.681
I ain't in it.

47:23.817 --> 47:25.576
It ain't in me, you know?
Mm-hm.

47:27.911 --> 47:30.913
If you do the fucking...
The shit will come back.

47:31.049 --> 47:34.222
This shit comes and goes.
You've gotta give it some time.

47:37.960 --> 47:39.160
That's the thing, Leon.

47:39.295 --> 47:41.097
I ain't got a lot of time
in this shit.

47:45.872 --> 47:48.201
It's like once a nigga
go over 30,

47:48.337 --> 47:50.265
they start looking at you
like a dinosaur,

47:50.400 --> 47:51.437
you know what I mean?

47:53.739 --> 47:56.578
It's definitely a young nigga's
game right now.

47:56.713 --> 47:57.608
I mean...

48:00.151 --> 48:02.315
You can change that.
But I don't know.

48:02.450 --> 48:04.483
That doesn't seem true
all the time.

48:05.882 --> 48:07.954
As long as you
keep making good music,

48:08.089 --> 48:09.888
you could go forever.

48:10.024 --> 48:10.929
Yeah, I feel you.

48:12.761 --> 48:15.295
Shit, man, aside from that, man,
this shit dangerous as fuck too.

48:15.431 --> 48:20.761
Mm-hm.
What fucking other job in music

48:20.897 --> 48:23.467
do you gotta worry
about getting shot?

48:23.603 --> 48:25.604
If I was a motherfucking
country singer,

48:25.739 --> 48:28.806
you think niggas would wanna
take my jewelry, nigga?

48:28.942 --> 48:29.838
Nah.

48:31.210 --> 48:32.247
Fucking rap, man.

48:33.920 --> 48:35.481
I got into this rap shit
to get...

48:37.954 --> 48:39.991
away from the streets.

48:40.126 --> 48:42.422
It seem like
this shit's just bringing me...

48:44.290 --> 48:45.788
ten times closer to it.

48:49.794 --> 48:52.102
So that tweet,
that shit was real, then?

48:57.808 --> 48:58.735
I don't know.

49:12.625 --> 49:13.519
I don't know.

49:24.100 --> 49:26.169
Look at that.
Okay.

49:28.507 --> 49:30.305
Wow.

49:30.441 --> 49:32.701
I didn't think this old guy
had it in him still.

49:32.837 --> 49:34.776
I didn't think I
could hit it that far.

49:43.181 --> 49:44.484
Whoa.

49:50.495 --> 49:53.890
Tiger Woods, nigga, what?
Get the fuck out of here, bro.

49:54.025 --> 49:57.524
That was fucking amazing!
Where'd that come from?

49:57.660 --> 49:59.369
Tiger Woods, nigga.

49:59.505 --> 50:03.005
<i>I'm walking, I'm walking,</i>
<i>I'm strolling.</i>

50:03.140 --> 50:04.337
<i>Look at this.</i>
Okay.

50:04.473 --> 50:07.210
<i>Kitchen.</i>
All right, I see you.

50:07.345 --> 50:09.739
<i>Wait, wait. Wait for it.</i>
<i>Look at this.</i>

50:09.874 --> 50:11.778
<i>Look at this. What's that?</i>
Okay.

50:11.913 --> 50:16.111
<i>I can peek through my kitchen</i>
<i>through a triangle.</i>

50:16.247 --> 50:17.187
Okay.

50:18.918 --> 50:22.023
<i>A triangle. All right, wait.</i>
Triangle, okay.

50:22.158 --> 50:24.194
I don't get it, but keep going.

50:24.329 --> 50:26.754
<i>All right. And then</i>
<i>you have a circle.</i>

50:26.889 --> 50:28.796
A circle.
<i>Look at this.</i>

50:30.995 --> 50:32.696
<i>This is a former</i>
<i>architect's house.</i>

50:32.831 --> 50:34.631
Are you giving me
a geometry lesson?

50:34.767 --> 50:37.338
What's going on
with this house, man?

50:37.473 --> 50:39.009
<i>It's nice, right?</i>
<i>Oh, okay.</i>

50:39.145 --> 50:41.272
Yeah.
<i>I have to show you this.</i>

50:41.408 --> 50:42.908
Yeah.
<i>What's this?</i>

50:43.044 --> 50:44.445
A-a drawer.

50:45.577 --> 50:48.544
<i>No, this is a credenza.</i>

50:48.680 --> 50:50.744
A cadenza?
<i>A credenza.</i>

50:50.880 --> 50:52.346
Cade-- What?
<i>Credenza.</i>

50:52.481 --> 50:53.949
Credenza.

50:54.084 --> 50:56.260
<i>That's right. It's a credenza.</i>
Yeah.

50:56.395 --> 50:59.389
When a nigga can't pronounce it,
it costs too much.

50:59.525 --> 51:01.224
All right, go ahead. Proceed.

51:15.143 --> 51:16.076
I love this house.

51:16.212 --> 51:17.472
I actually used to play here

51:17.608 --> 51:19.743
when I was a little kid.

51:19.878 --> 51:22.346
True enough.
That didn't sound too right.

51:22.482 --> 51:23.987
You played here doing what?

51:24.122 --> 51:25.689
You know, playing doctor

51:25.824 --> 51:26.857
with the young boys.

51:26.992 --> 51:28.189
Oh, okay.
Thank you.

51:28.325 --> 51:30.994
All right.
Playing doctor, all right.

51:31.129 --> 51:32.356
Playing house.

51:32.492 --> 51:33.624
Cheers.
Cheers.

51:33.760 --> 51:35.925
Thanks for having me.
It's all good.

51:39.572 --> 51:42.505
I wonder if there's something
out there that could fuck me up,

51:42.641 --> 51:45.676
like a wolf or a grizzly bear
or some shit like that.

51:48.408 --> 51:50.406
Yeah, there is, actually.

51:50.542 --> 51:51.609
Yeah?
Yeah.

51:51.744 --> 51:55.419
There's bears
and coyotes and snakes.

51:57.883 --> 51:59.416
I ain't fucking with that.
Fisher cats.

51:59.552 --> 52:01.189
What?
Fisher cats.

52:01.324 --> 52:03.117
What the fuck
is a fisher cat?

52:03.252 --> 52:06.093
Ooh. I'm so sorry to be
the one to tell you this,

52:06.229 --> 52:08.695
but there are these wild cats.

52:08.831 --> 52:12.303
They're big, and they're very
ugly, and they're very mean.

52:12.438 --> 52:18.505
And they kill other adorable
house cats by fisting them,

52:18.640 --> 52:22.475
pulling out their intestines
and eating them.

52:22.610 --> 52:24.744
They fist them? What?
Yeah, okay.

52:24.880 --> 52:27.184
Let me just give you an example.
Like fist in the ass?

52:27.319 --> 52:30.346
Here's a cat,
and here's this other cat.

52:30.481 --> 52:32.053
Kk-kk, argh!

52:32.189 --> 52:35.054
The guts. Think about that.

52:35.189 --> 52:36.489
You're welcome.

52:36.625 --> 52:39.020
I don't like cats.
Heh, me neither.

52:39.155 --> 52:41.055
Whoa.
I know you ain't talking shit

52:41.191 --> 52:43.397
about my statue.
Oh, this is a Mercury special?

52:43.532 --> 52:45.631
Yeah, that's my lucky statue.
Oh.

52:45.767 --> 52:48.129
This is Mercury.
This the god, Mercury.

52:48.264 --> 52:50.372
You never read nothin'
about him in books?

52:50.508 --> 52:52.977
Oh, no. I don't read.
Oh, you don't read?

52:53.112 --> 52:55.477
Well, this nigga
was that nigga

52:55.612 --> 52:57.875
when it came
to the Greek niggas, you know?

52:58.011 --> 53:00.014
So my mama named me after
that nigga, so...

53:00.149 --> 53:01.250
Hmm.
You know.

53:01.386 --> 53:03.682
That's nice.
I got the little trap phone,

53:03.818 --> 53:06.352
and you know what I'm saying?
Flip phone.

53:06.487 --> 53:08.223
Trap phone.
Trap phone.

53:08.358 --> 53:09.689
Trap phone.
Trap phone.

53:09.824 --> 53:12.019
Yeah, we trap it
off of that phone. Get it?

53:12.155 --> 53:13.858
I got you.
So we can make our moves,

53:13.993 --> 53:16.200
our plays, you dig? Oh, yeah.
Okay. I got you.

53:16.336 --> 53:18.194
I got the tape,
you know what I mean?

53:18.330 --> 53:21.696
Nigga was delivering a message,
you know what I'm saying?

53:21.832 --> 53:23.939
You feel me?
I feel you.

53:24.075 --> 53:25.573
Yeah.
Beautiful.

53:29.713 --> 53:32.546
So, what college you say
you was thinking about going to?

53:32.681 --> 53:35.450
I really want
this one in Louisiana.

53:35.586 --> 53:39.418
Um, there's one in Alabama,
Lord help me.

53:39.554 --> 53:41.092
Alabama?
Yep.

53:41.227 --> 53:42.552
Hell, no.
I know.

53:42.688 --> 53:44.253
I'm gonna go be a hillbilly.

53:44.389 --> 53:47.131
And then something in Florida.
You're already a hillbilly.

53:47.266 --> 53:49.024
You gonna be
an even bigger hillbilly?

53:49.159 --> 53:51.698
Thanks. Don't judge a book
by its cover.

53:53.171 --> 53:55.371
Yeah, so, I mean, we'll see.

53:55.506 --> 53:57.468
Maybe I'll get in.
Maybe I fucking won't.

53:57.604 --> 53:59.101
Maybe I'll save that...

54:00.909 --> 54:03.442
Fifty thousand dollars' worth
of debt every year,

54:03.577 --> 54:04.876
or whatever the fuck it is.

54:07.184 --> 54:08.418
Did you go to college?

54:09.846 --> 54:11.419
Fuck college. I can rap.

54:11.555 --> 54:13.080
The fuck I need to go
to college for?

54:13.216 --> 54:14.953
Yeah, for real,
'cause you're lucky.

54:15.088 --> 54:17.427
You're one of the lucky ones.
You got talent.

54:20.428 --> 54:21.992
You love what you do?

54:24.837 --> 54:26.170
Yeah, it's cool.

54:26.305 --> 54:29.367
It got its ups and downs
and shit,

54:29.502 --> 54:31.141
but, yeah, I like it.

54:31.276 --> 54:33.267
I like the money.
I bet.

54:34.941 --> 54:36.506
What if you couldn't do it
anymore,

54:36.641 --> 54:38.542
what would you do?

54:38.678 --> 54:40.613
Couldn't do what anymore, rap?

54:40.749 --> 54:43.013
You know, yeah,
make music, perform.

54:45.619 --> 54:48.016
Sell crack. Duh.

54:48.152 --> 54:52.086
No, I wanna, like,
help people somehow.

54:52.222 --> 54:54.590
Help people do what?
I don't know,

54:54.726 --> 54:55.856
get their shit together.

54:55.992 --> 54:57.701
You know, some counseling.

54:57.837 --> 54:58.996
Like...

55:00.931 --> 55:02.503
I mean, there's so much...

55:02.639 --> 55:05.270
Do you wanna start a rehab
or some shit?

55:05.405 --> 55:06.438
Could do.

55:06.574 --> 55:08.969
I mean, it helped me out,

55:09.105 --> 55:10.804
changed my fucking life, so...

55:10.939 --> 55:12.039
We can work together.

55:12.175 --> 55:13.845
I sell crack,
you rehabilitate them.

55:13.980 --> 55:15.951
Thank you. This is
a million-dollar idea.

55:19.986 --> 55:21.554
What'd you mean,
it helped you out?

55:21.689 --> 55:24.522
You been to rehab before?
Mm-hm.

55:24.658 --> 55:26.760
For what?
Pills.

55:29.633 --> 55:32.203
It's kind of the way it goes
around here.

55:32.338 --> 55:35.763
What kind of pills?
Xanax, OxyContin?

55:37.173 --> 55:38.341
Mm.
Oxy.

55:38.476 --> 55:40.567
Right on the nose, huh?

55:40.703 --> 55:41.709
Yeah.

56:39.403 --> 56:40.761
Okay.

56:43.469 --> 56:44.739
Bravo.

56:47.573 --> 56:50.147
Um, see you.

56:50.283 --> 56:52.749
See you later. Hopefully soon.

56:52.885 --> 56:53.781
Mm-hm.

56:56.922 --> 56:58.082
Okay.

56:59.553 --> 57:01.452
Bye!
Bye!

57:15.305 --> 57:16.804
Yo.

57:18.201 --> 57:19.510
PAUL
<i>Yo.</i>

57:21.142 --> 57:23.811
Your shit is breaking up.
You got bad service.

57:26.247 --> 57:28.680
<i>It's 'cause you're</i>
<i>in the middle of nowhere, bro.</i>

57:28.815 --> 57:30.383
<i>You don't see me though?</i>

57:30.518 --> 57:31.687
That's you, man.

57:33.153 --> 57:35.549
<i>This New York show</i>
<i>coming up, man.</i>

57:35.684 --> 57:37.724
<i>It's getting more</i>
<i>and more crazy by the day.</i>

57:37.860 --> 57:40.189
<i>There's mad hype on this shit.</i>

57:40.325 --> 57:42.226
<i>Everybody's talking about it</i>
<i>online</i>

57:42.362 --> 57:44.460

57:47.200 --> 57:49.997
<i>Um, I just feel</i>
<i>so much momentum</i>

57:50.133 --> 57:51.565
<i>going into that show.</i>

57:51.700 --> 57:54.336
I don't know, man.
That's kind of quick. I don't...

57:56.146 --> 58:00.042
I don't know if I'm ready
to jump back on-stage yet. Uh...

58:00.177 --> 58:02.315
<i>You come alive on-stage, bro.</i>

58:02.450 --> 58:04.653
<i>What you're searching for</i>
<i>up there might be on-stage.</i>

58:04.789 --> 58:06.216

58:06.351 --> 58:08.219

58:08.355 --> 58:10.627

<i>What's happening</i>
<i>with the tracks, man?</i>

58:16.460 --> 58:18.399
I'm working on it.
I'm working on it, man.

58:18.535 --> 58:20.197
I got some stuff recorded.

58:21.969 --> 58:23.373
<i>For real?</i>
Yeah. For real, man.

58:23.508 --> 58:24.933
I just want-- You know me, man.

58:25.069 --> 58:27.235
I'm a perfectionist, so...

58:27.371 --> 58:29.239
I just gotta get it
all the way tight.

58:29.375 --> 58:31.376

<i>send me something?</i>

58:32.750 --> 58:35.948
I was thinking--
<i>I gotta hear something.</i>

58:36.083 --> 58:37.713
I'll send you something
by tomorrow.

58:37.849 --> 58:39.220

1:00:49.782 --> 1:00:51.480
Oh, really?

1:00:51.616 --> 1:00:55.252
God, it feels
like a warm summer day to me.

1:00:55.387 --> 1:00:58.655
That's some bullshit.
I left my weed. Fuck.

1:00:58.790 --> 1:00:59.961
Damn.

1:01:01.591 --> 1:01:04.458
Could've been getting high
right here.

1:01:04.594 --> 1:01:07.203
I know you used to get high
right here.

1:01:08.637 --> 1:01:10.139
You feel that?

1:01:12.368 --> 1:01:14.068
Feel the energy.
Mm.

1:01:14.203 --> 1:01:15.535
Can feel the drugs.

1:01:15.671 --> 1:01:19.482
Yeah, not all good times,

1:01:19.617 --> 1:01:21.851
but I still love this spot.

1:01:23.651 --> 1:01:24.755
Yeah, it's cool.

1:01:26.181 --> 1:01:27.587
Let's get in.

1:01:27.723 --> 1:01:29.022
The fuck? Oh, hell, nah.

1:01:29.157 --> 1:01:31.451
You crazy.
Let's get in. It'll be quick.

1:01:31.586 --> 1:01:33.393
Fuck that.
It's not that deep.

1:01:33.529 --> 1:01:35.357
Nuh-uh. Nah.

1:01:35.493 --> 1:01:37.125
No?
Niggas don't do shit like this.

1:01:37.261 --> 1:01:38.460
Oh, come on!
We just--

1:01:38.595 --> 1:01:41.033
Live a little.
We just look at the view.

1:01:41.168 --> 1:01:44.565
Fuck that. Hell, nah.
You got it.

1:01:44.701 --> 1:01:46.640
You got it, shawty.
I'm about to cuddle up

1:01:46.776 --> 1:01:48.746
in this motherfucking blanket.

1:01:55.885 --> 1:01:57.947
Is it warm?
It's really warm.

1:01:58.083 --> 1:01:59.616
For real?
Yeah.

1:01:59.751 --> 1:02:02.221
It's this weird thing
in the fall and in the winter.

1:02:02.356 --> 1:02:04.553
All of a sudden,
the water gets really hot.

1:02:04.688 --> 1:02:07.693
You're bullshitting me.
No, no, no. Come down.

1:02:10.428 --> 1:02:12.234
Oh, no, no, no.
Throw your ass in.

1:02:15.201 --> 1:02:17.603
The fuck?
Are you okay?

1:02:17.739 --> 1:02:18.908
Fuck you, man.

1:02:21.747 --> 1:02:23.746
Should have threw your ass
in there.

1:02:23.882 --> 1:02:25.443
You ain't scared of--
Cold as fuck.

1:02:25.579 --> 1:02:28.379
You want to come in the fucking
water. What the fuck?

1:04:10.212 --> 1:04:11.646
Yo.

1:04:11.782 --> 1:04:14.223
<i>This track is quality, dude.</i>

1:04:14.358 --> 1:04:16.653
<i>You remember what I've</i>
<i>told you, man, many times:</i>

1:04:16.788 --> 1:04:20.161
<i>Quality plus vision</i>
<i>equals sales, man.</i>

1:04:20.296 --> 1:04:22.427
<i>I can see--</i>
<i>You gave me a vision.</i>

1:04:22.562 --> 1:04:24.100
<i>Just listening to it,</i>
<i>I was, like,</i>

1:04:24.235 --> 1:04:26.729
<i>"Yo, I have a vision</i>
<i>for how to market this,</i>

1:04:26.864 --> 1:04:28.671
<i>for how to get it</i>
<i>where it's gotta be."</i>

1:04:28.806 --> 1:04:30.567
Yeah, man, that ain't shit.

1:04:30.702 --> 1:04:32.735
I do that shit
in my motherfucking sleep.

1:04:32.871 --> 1:04:35.946
Shit, man, I got a fucking skunk
in the fucking house.

1:04:37.012 --> 1:04:38.542
<i>Something smelling?</i>

1:04:40.784 --> 1:04:42.282
<i>You got a smell going?</i>

1:04:43.553 --> 1:04:44.713
<i>Hello?</i>

1:04:46.053 --> 1:04:47.419
<i>Hello, you there?</i>

1:04:48.625 --> 1:04:50.455
<i>Merc?</i>

1:04:50.591 --> 1:04:52.963
<i>I feel like I hear you.</i>
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

1:05:02.968 --> 1:05:05.004
Rats. Huh.

1:05:05.139 --> 1:05:08.011
Kangaroo rat. What the fuck?

1:05:11.783 --> 1:05:15.744
A small-tail shrew, mole.

1:05:19.183 --> 1:05:22.058
Ah, skunks, 568.

1:05:45.142 --> 1:05:50.143
Also, this kind of shit, cutting
into the meat is no good, NG.

1:05:50.278 --> 1:05:52.721
I didn't really cut into
the meat. I'm cutting skin.

1:05:52.857 --> 1:05:54.552
Yeah, I know, but see these?

1:05:56.292 --> 1:05:58.886
I think that was
on your side, honestly.

1:06:02.796 --> 1:06:05.402
I'm gonna grab us a couple of
beers. I'll be back in a bit.

1:06:05.537 --> 1:06:06.894
All right.

1:06:24.689 --> 1:06:27.024
Mm-- Oh, shit!

1:06:33.960 --> 1:06:35.463
Aah!

1:06:35.599 --> 1:06:37.465
Fuck!

1:06:48.178 --> 1:06:50.278
Got them beers, man.

1:06:54.814 --> 1:06:58.215
The one fucking thing.
I was cutting around the spine.

1:06:58.351 --> 1:06:59.916
Getting the-- You know?

1:07:00.052 --> 1:07:02.123
Trying to slice the spine down
and I grabbed the liver,

1:07:02.258 --> 1:07:03.787
and this shit just--
I don't know.

1:07:03.922 --> 1:07:06.392
The shit started squirting out.
There was one thing,

1:07:06.528 --> 1:07:09.528
one thing when we did that pig,
one thing.

1:07:13.028 --> 1:07:15.101
So we can't save the fucking...?

1:07:15.237 --> 1:07:16.763
I've been cleaning it up, man.

1:07:16.898 --> 1:07:18.774
You can't save the meat at all?

1:07:18.910 --> 1:07:20.373
You can save a portion of it.

1:07:20.508 --> 1:07:22.539
I'm putting the rest of it
in the ground.

1:07:22.674 --> 1:07:25.245
That's $2000 worth
of fucking meat!

1:07:25.381 --> 1:07:26.916
Two thousand fucking dollars,
man?

1:07:27.051 --> 1:07:28.582
I'll buy you
another fucking cow.

1:07:28.717 --> 1:07:30.878
I already offered to help you
with the fucking farm.

1:07:31.014 --> 1:07:32.784
I don't know
why you don't fuck with me

1:07:32.920 --> 1:07:35.750
and let me partner with you.
I don't want no one else's cow.

1:07:35.886 --> 1:07:38.623
I don't want your money.
I want my beef.

1:07:41.162 --> 1:07:43.266
"I want to be a farmer."

1:07:43.401 --> 1:07:45.930
No way, it's like me wanting
to be a fucking rap star.

1:07:46.066 --> 1:07:47.269
No way, man!

1:07:48.599 --> 1:07:50.900
You pussy-ass, old, white bitch.

1:07:51.035 --> 1:07:54.307
You gonna try to talk shit to me
'cause of a fucking cow?

1:07:54.443 --> 1:07:56.069
I told you,
I'd get you another one.

1:07:56.205 --> 1:07:58.446
Another one? And where
are you getting that cow?

1:07:58.582 --> 1:08:01.443
And whose the fuck's is it?
And what food did it eat?

1:08:01.579 --> 1:08:03.844
You just don't fucking get it!

1:08:03.979 --> 1:08:06.313
Hey, man, you know what?
Fuck you.

1:08:06.448 --> 1:08:09.455
You talking all this shit, what
I'd never be, what I can't do.

1:08:09.590 --> 1:08:11.294
That's the problem
with this country.

1:08:11.429 --> 1:08:13.658
White fuckers like you
always trying to tell a nigga

1:08:13.793 --> 1:08:16.457
what he can't do.
Fuck you and this farm, Bob.

1:08:16.593 --> 1:08:18.333
I'm out this bitch.

1:09:21.765 --> 1:09:22.826
Yeah.

1:10:05.000 --> 1:10:06.600
Oh, shit.

1:10:06.736 --> 1:10:10.042
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

1:10:10.177 --> 1:10:11.413
Oh, shit.

1:10:16.050 --> 1:10:17.820
Fuck.

1:12:00.620 --> 1:12:02.051
What the fuck?

1:12:05.659 --> 1:12:07.155
Oh, hell, nah!

1:12:11.693 --> 1:12:12.930
Bitch!

1:12:15.235 --> 1:12:16.538
Fuck!

1:12:43.696 --> 1:12:45.727
Hey.
Somebody just broke

1:12:45.863 --> 1:12:48.061
my motherfucking windshield.

1:12:48.196 --> 1:12:50.440
Your windshield?
Yeah, man.

1:12:50.575 --> 1:12:52.741
Could have been somebody
that saw me with you.

1:12:52.876 --> 1:12:56.006
An old boyfriend or one
of these old motherfuckers.

1:12:56.142 --> 1:12:59.243
They gonna get smoked,
fucking with my shit.

1:12:59.378 --> 1:13:00.714
Could be.

1:13:02.620 --> 1:13:06.654
I told you, this town is
for the fucking birds.

1:13:06.790 --> 1:13:09.392
People are stupid around here.
It's a small town.

1:13:09.527 --> 1:13:13.155
Maybe somebody got pissed off.
Whatever.

1:13:13.290 --> 1:13:15.388
That's why I wanna
get the fuck out of here.

1:13:23.438 --> 1:13:25.134
Why you like it here?

1:13:26.405 --> 1:13:27.510
Hmm?

1:13:29.744 --> 1:13:31.943
Why you really
wanna stay around here?

1:13:41.886 --> 1:13:43.625
Good place to hide, huh?

1:13:45.295 --> 1:13:46.826
Sorry about your car.

1:14:02.310 --> 1:14:03.436
Hey, man.

1:14:07.944 --> 1:14:09.519
About five more minutes.

1:14:10.817 --> 1:14:12.786
All right, man.
All right?

1:14:26.260 --> 1:14:28.296
Okay, let me give you this.

1:14:29.338 --> 1:14:30.801
Here you go, and--

1:14:30.936 --> 1:14:32.838
Oh, uh, wait
about 30 minutes

1:14:32.973 --> 1:14:34.938
for the cement to,
you know, seal itself,

1:14:35.074 --> 1:14:37.310
and then you can take it
for a ride.

1:14:37.446 --> 1:14:39.380
I got you.
All right.

1:14:39.515 --> 1:14:41.276
Have a good one.
You too.

1:15:20.822 --> 1:15:22.684
- Come on, blue.
- Hey!

1:15:22.819 --> 1:15:24.086
Oh!

1:15:24.222 --> 1:15:26.596
Do it, blue. Do it, blue.

1:15:28.156 --> 1:15:29.960
Oh!

1:15:30.095 --> 1:15:31.864
That's okay. Give them one.

1:15:31.999 --> 1:15:33.698
I know you was.
It's your serve.

1:15:33.834 --> 1:15:35.195
Ready?
- Sore losers.

1:15:37.373 --> 1:15:38.931
Come on, man.

1:15:44.980 --> 1:15:48.779
Wait. Oh-- Yeah.
Thought for sure that was it.

1:15:48.915 --> 1:15:51.214
Yeah! Oh!
- Thank you!

1:15:58.528 --> 1:16:00.229
Boo!
I'm the MVP!

1:16:00.365 --> 1:16:01.596
I had the blocked shots.

1:16:01.731 --> 1:16:03.932
And motherfuckers stole points,
nigga!

1:16:04.068 --> 1:16:04.993
Booyaka!

1:16:12.911 --> 1:16:16.404
There's an abundance of food,
an abundance of alcohol.

1:16:16.540 --> 1:16:19.112
There's an abundance of drugs
everywhere you go.

1:16:19.248 --> 1:16:23.284
And people go, "It's my choice,
right? I'm free to do that."

1:16:23.420 --> 1:16:25.611
Hey, Merc?
What?

1:16:25.746 --> 1:16:28.116
What's that motherfucking smell
outside, man?

1:16:28.252 --> 1:16:30.149
Smell like
a motherfucking skunk.

1:16:30.285 --> 1:16:32.092
What I'mma do about a skunk?

1:16:32.228 --> 1:16:34.893
I've been looking for the
motherfucker. I can't find it.

1:16:35.028 --> 1:16:37.056
Looking for the motherfucker?

1:16:37.191 --> 1:16:38.491
You hear this nigga?

1:16:38.626 --> 1:16:40.269
You look for a nigga,
you find him.

1:16:40.405 --> 1:16:41.736
You can't find a skunk?

1:16:41.872 --> 1:16:43.664
Put up an air freshener
or something.

1:16:43.800 --> 1:16:46.401
Give me some money!
Give me some money!

1:16:52.947 --> 1:16:55.785
Hey. Hey. Oh, shit.
Damn, man.

1:16:55.920 --> 1:16:58.514
Here's what your whole theory
is dependent on,

1:16:58.650 --> 1:17:02.152
that the bear can get behind
the bull and eat the bull's ass.

1:17:02.287 --> 1:17:04.452
What?
No. Nah, they're gonna eat it,

1:17:04.587 --> 1:17:08.892
chew on its back, its hind legs.
No, no, no.

1:17:09.027 --> 1:17:11.160
A bear gonna beat a bull.

1:17:11.296 --> 1:17:13.334
- Bull?
- A bull is massive, bro.

1:17:13.469 --> 1:17:15.530
They're fucking crazy.

1:17:15.666 --> 1:17:18.036
When the bull see the bear,
he ain't gonna fuck with him.

1:17:18.172 --> 1:17:20.908
And that's me. Let's go.
You high as fuck.

1:17:21.043 --> 1:17:23.806
Fuckin' bull. How the fuck
a nigga think a bull--?

1:17:23.942 --> 1:17:26.010
A nigga beat a bull up.

1:17:26.146 --> 1:17:29.048
You see a nigga beat
a fucking bear? Never.

1:17:45.466 --> 1:17:48.602
I went looking for the remote
and look what the fuck I found.

1:17:48.737 --> 1:17:51.531
This nigga still got this shit.

1:17:51.666 --> 1:17:53.566
Must got some complex,
walking around

1:17:53.701 --> 1:17:55.338
with a white man
with a little dick.

1:17:55.473 --> 1:17:57.544
What you doing at night,
this shit? Ee-ee-ee!

1:17:57.680 --> 1:17:59.441
Or you be back here...?

1:18:03.352 --> 1:18:06.180
Why are you touching my shit?
Because what the fuck is this?

1:18:06.315 --> 1:18:07.613
You still carrying on with this?

1:18:07.749 --> 1:18:10.724
This is crazy.
How you still got this?

1:18:10.859 --> 1:18:12.862
Why the fuck
you touching my shit?

1:18:12.997 --> 1:18:15.260
You ain't gotta go like that,
get all shit crazy.

1:18:15.395 --> 1:18:17.865
Why you going crazy?
You go in a motherfucker's crib

1:18:18.001 --> 1:18:19.701
and just touch their shit.
I just seen it.

1:18:19.837 --> 1:18:22.037
I don't believe
you still got this shit.

1:18:22.172 --> 1:18:25.036
I really don't believe it.
You don't need to believe it.

1:18:25.172 --> 1:18:27.006
Believe it,
I'm in your face, bitch.

1:18:27.141 --> 1:18:29.175
Nobody worried about that.
Fuck you.

1:18:29.310 --> 1:18:31.614
You going crazy here.
Fuck you, bald-headed bitch.

1:18:31.749 --> 1:18:33.374
Get the fuck out.
What are you, hairy?

1:18:33.510 --> 1:18:35.677
Come on, bro.
This place making you crazy.

1:18:35.813 --> 1:18:38.280
What the fuck you doing here?
You ain't no mountain dude.

1:18:38.416 --> 1:18:40.250
What's wrong with you?
- Hey.

1:18:40.385 --> 1:18:42.725
Get out of here.
This driving you crazy.

1:18:42.860 --> 1:18:44.021
You shouldn't
have brought that up.

1:18:44.156 --> 1:18:46.422
Fuck that shit. Give me my hat.

1:18:46.558 --> 1:18:48.754
Fuck you. Fuck you
and that little white man.

1:18:48.890 --> 1:18:51.359
- Fuck you, nigga.
Who, me or the statue?

1:18:51.494 --> 1:18:53.131
You too! The statue and you!

1:18:53.267 --> 1:18:55.035
Fuck y'all.
- Fuck you, bitch.

1:19:00.442 --> 1:19:01.573
What?

1:19:04.175 --> 1:19:05.639
My man...

1:19:07.845 --> 1:19:13.420
This is great and all, like,
yo, tonight was... Was fun.

1:19:13.555 --> 1:19:14.923
Ahem, but...

1:19:16.822 --> 1:19:18.193
I'm like...

1:19:19.963 --> 1:19:21.925
You tripping.
You had too much to drink.

1:19:22.061 --> 1:19:23.996
No, hear me out. Hear me out.

1:19:24.132 --> 1:19:25.930
You don't gotta worry about me.
I did--

1:19:26.065 --> 1:19:28.268
Hey, I'm not gonna lie, man.

1:19:28.404 --> 1:19:32.204
I'm coming out of my face right
now. On the real, though...

1:19:40.348 --> 1:19:43.653
You're the star, right?
You're the main attraction.

1:19:43.788 --> 1:19:46.648
You're the creative genius,
right?

1:19:46.783 --> 1:19:50.550
I give you that respect,
you know what I'm saying?

1:19:50.686 --> 1:19:54.522
But, yo,
I'm a facilitator, right?

1:19:54.657 --> 1:19:56.965
That's what you pay me to do,
dude.

1:19:57.100 --> 1:20:00.331
And I'm just trying to say,
bro, like...

1:20:00.466 --> 1:20:04.807
We did-- We built this.
We did this together.

1:20:04.942 --> 1:20:07.174
You can't say
my contributions mean nothing.

1:20:07.309 --> 1:20:10.875
Yeah, and you can't tell me
when I had enough.

1:20:11.011 --> 1:20:13.014
Calm the fuck down, dawg.

1:20:14.780 --> 1:20:16.348
My dude.

1:20:16.484 --> 1:20:20.383
Damn, my nigga, get your head
out the clouds for a second.

1:20:20.518 --> 1:20:22.353
Ten years from now,
you had enough,

1:20:22.489 --> 1:20:25.184
you're gonna come out
with some new manager,

1:20:25.319 --> 1:20:26.795
some new career,

1:20:26.930 --> 1:20:30.129
on some retro
"Yo, I'm back" shit.

1:20:30.264 --> 1:20:32.395
That's what
I'm worried about, bro.

1:20:32.531 --> 1:20:35.969
I lose you now,
you quit the game now,

1:20:36.104 --> 1:20:38.403
a decade,
you need some cash,

1:20:38.538 --> 1:20:40.839
you're back out
with some other motherfucker.

1:20:40.975 --> 1:20:42.802
I put too much work in, bro.

1:20:42.937 --> 1:20:46.377
Man, I'm Money Merc.
I am money, nigga. I'm good.

1:20:53.222 --> 1:20:56.751
Let's get the show done, dude.
New York. Come on.

1:20:56.886 --> 1:21:00.588
That's that shit.
Why you sound so thirsty, man?

1:21:00.723 --> 1:21:03.162
'Cause I am, bro.
I mean, look, man.

1:21:03.297 --> 1:21:06.359
You know I got five kids, dude.
Come on.

1:21:06.494 --> 1:21:08.234
You know what that is.

1:21:11.201 --> 1:21:12.667
New York City.

1:21:14.908 --> 1:21:16.703
New York City.

1:21:16.838 --> 1:21:18.442
That's when everybody
can come out.

1:21:18.577 --> 1:21:21.544
The world can see you.
Let the world know.

1:21:23.284 --> 1:21:26.280
New York City?
It's the one gig, bro.

1:21:26.415 --> 1:21:28.055
Come out, blast that shit.

1:21:28.191 --> 1:21:31.257
Rock that shit.
You know what I'm saying?

1:21:32.855 --> 1:21:35.325
New York City?
Make people feel that shit.

1:21:35.461 --> 1:21:38.296
New York City?
Yo, New York City.

1:21:38.431 --> 1:21:41.597
New York City?
New York City, right?

1:21:42.696 --> 1:21:44.567
Yeah.
New York City.

1:22:05.159 --> 1:22:07.687
Well, that's exciting.
Yeah.

1:22:07.823 --> 1:22:10.328
Bet you're happy
to be back on-stage.

1:22:10.464 --> 1:22:13.530
Definitely happy
to get back on-stage.

1:22:13.665 --> 1:22:16.463
Can't wait.
I'm gonna get my mojo back.

1:22:16.598 --> 1:22:18.773
Give the people what they want.

1:22:18.908 --> 1:22:20.272
Yeah.

1:22:20.407 --> 1:22:22.243
I just want that feeling back,
you know?

1:22:22.379 --> 1:22:25.179
Once I get up there,
I'll feel it again, you know?

1:22:26.750 --> 1:22:28.248
You should come with me.

1:22:29.314 --> 1:22:31.810
This weekend, New York.

1:22:31.946 --> 1:22:36.284
Go to the show, shop,
all of that.

1:22:36.419 --> 1:22:38.585
You know what I mean?

1:22:38.720 --> 1:22:41.122
You and me
in New York City, huh?

1:22:41.258 --> 1:22:42.760
New York City.

1:22:46.397 --> 1:22:48.664
Yeah?
That's nice. Um...

1:22:51.800 --> 1:22:54.304
I got into grad school.
Oh, yeah?

1:22:54.439 --> 1:22:56.108
Yeah.
Oh, shit, congrats.

1:22:56.243 --> 1:22:57.976
Thanks.
That's what's up.

1:22:58.112 --> 1:22:59.840
I'm going to Louisiana.

1:23:00.917 --> 1:23:03.113
Yeah?

1:23:03.249 --> 1:23:04.979
Um, ahem.
Louisiana?

1:23:05.115 --> 1:23:06.846
Mm-hm.

1:23:06.981 --> 1:23:09.554
I got a friend there
who's got a restaurant.

1:23:09.689 --> 1:23:12.826
She's gonna hook me up
with a job and an apartment,

1:23:12.962 --> 1:23:16.989
and I'm gonna go next week.

1:23:18.665 --> 1:23:20.933
You're gonna leave here
to work at a restaurant

1:23:21.069 --> 1:23:22.334
in dusty-ass Louisiana?

1:23:22.469 --> 1:23:24.831
Yeah, make some money
before I start school.

1:23:24.966 --> 1:23:26.999
You'll just be in debt
with grad school.

1:23:27.134 --> 1:23:28.934
You said you didn't
wanna do this shit.

1:23:29.069 --> 1:23:30.906
And fuck Louisiana.
That shit dirty.

1:23:31.042 --> 1:23:33.609
Every time I tour and go
to New Orleans or Baton Rouge,

1:23:33.745 --> 1:23:36.017
I hate that shit.
The food overrated.

1:23:36.152 --> 1:23:38.054
Shit make
my fucking stomach hurt.

1:23:42.084 --> 1:23:45.391
Shit. We're just going
to New York for the weekend.

1:24:50.391 --> 1:24:59.498
<i>It's pretty simple.</i>
