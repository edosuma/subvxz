00:47.923 --> 00:49.925
There 's this psychiatrist...

00:50.259 --> 00:53.428
...a lady named
Dr. Frances Cress Welsing.

00:53.637 --> 00:57.057
She has a theory
about the black man in America.

00:57.266 --> 01:00.602
She says that because
of the system of racism...

01:00.894 --> 01:05.065
...he's been made
to think of himself as a baby...

01:05.274 --> 01:10.821
...a not-yet fully formed being who
hasn't realized his full potential.

01:11.446 --> 01:14.783
To support her claim,
she offers the following:

01:17.619 --> 01:19.121
First off...

01:21.123 --> 01:24.084
...what does a black man
call his woman?

01:26.795 --> 01:28.130
Mama.

01:28.630 --> 01:33.635
Second, what does a black man
call his closest acquaintances?

01:34.970 --> 01:36.638
His boys.

01:37.973 --> 01:42.936
And finally, what does a black man
call his place of residence?

01:43.979 --> 01:45.647
The crib.

02:03.999 --> 02:05.167
No!

02:05.501 --> 02:08.169
I don 't want to lose my baby!

02:32.361 --> 02:33.362
Baby!

02:39.535 --> 02:41.036
Come on, babe.

02:43.705 --> 02:45.040
You all right?

02:48.418 --> 02:50.546
We'll go straight home, okay?

02:54.716 --> 02:56.218
Jody!

03:00.222 --> 03:02.391
Baby, come on.

03:03.809 --> 03:07.479
Just take it easy, okay?
Just get in.

03:09.898 --> 03:11.733
Take it easy, baby.

03:23.412 --> 03:24.746
Baby?

03:25.914 --> 03:27.249
Yvette?

03:28.917 --> 03:30.586
You going to sleep?

03:33.589 --> 03:35.257
Are you hungry?

03:36.425 --> 03:41.555
I'll go to Lucy's and get you a cheese
enchilada and a strawberry shake.

03:41.763 --> 03:44.099
That'd make you feel better.

03:44.933 --> 03:47.227
I'm fine, Jody.

03:49.938 --> 03:52.608
You don't need Daddy
to be here for you?

03:53.609 --> 03:56.445
I'm just trying to take care of you.

03:56.778 --> 03:59.448
Seems like you already done that.

04:00.949 --> 04:04.578
Leave me alone, Jody.
Just get out of my face.

04:13.295 --> 04:16.839
Then I guess you don't mind
if I use your car, huh?

04:17.632 --> 04:19.801
Since you're going to sleep.

04:25.933 --> 04:27.392
What's up, little homie?

04:27.809 --> 04:29.978
What's going down with you?

04:30.479 --> 04:32.147
Get the hell home.

04:43.492 --> 04:44.451
Peanut?

04:47.162 --> 04:50.832
Why are you screaming?
I'm hungry. Fix me some food.

05:17.651 --> 05:19.278
You gonna give me some love?

05:19.528 --> 05:23.866
Hey, Ms. Herron.
How's Daddy's little girl doing?

05:25.868 --> 05:29.872
Look at you. Suckie-suckie, now.
Come on.

05:31.373 --> 05:33.375
How's Daddy's little baby?

05:33.709 --> 05:37.588
-Jody, you're parked in the driveway.
-Sorry. I'll move it.

05:37.796 --> 05:40.674
Least you can do
is wash mine before you leave.

05:40.883 --> 05:43.719
I got it.
Say, "Daddy got it, Grandma.

05:44.052 --> 05:46.346
Daddy got it all under control."

05:46.555 --> 05:48.473
Look at my pretty baby.

05:48.682 --> 05:52.561
One thing I know how to do
is make some pretty babies.

05:53.562 --> 05:55.898
That's my baby.
That's my little girl.

05:56.231 --> 06:00.194
When will you say "Daddy"?
You want to go to Disneyland?

06:03.238 --> 06:05.073
That's my baby.

06:07.075 --> 06:09.411
Sleep, sleep, sleep.

06:33.936 --> 06:36.230
Go on and pull the damage out.

07:03.632 --> 07:06.093
What you doing to the backyard, Mama?

07:06.301 --> 07:08.637
I told you I was starting a garden.

07:10.305 --> 07:12.599
You've said that for the longest.

07:12.766 --> 07:17.437
I must be getting old. I'm doing the
same things I seen my mama do.

07:17.646 --> 07:20.440
I'm planting collards,
mustard greens...

07:20.607 --> 07:23.819
...and all this over here
will be my corn.

07:24.152 --> 07:28.031
Tomatoes. Then I'll get
a lace awning at Home Depot...

07:28.240 --> 07:33.161
...so I can sit here, tune you out and
sip my wine while my tomatoes grow.

07:33.495 --> 07:38.166
My cabbage is over there.
My beans, onions and sage.

07:40.502 --> 07:41.837
How's Yvette?

07:42.171 --> 07:43.839
She's all right. Sleeping.

07:44.047 --> 07:47.301
I can't give you money
every time you get a girl pregnant.

07:47.509 --> 07:49.511
I know, Mama.

07:58.687 --> 08:02.691
This is Melvin.
He's helping me with my new garden.

08:03.025 --> 08:05.319
He owns a landscaping business.

08:05.527 --> 08:08.530
Maybe you can work for him
and make some money.

08:09.198 --> 08:12.284
Your mama told me you got a problem
finding a job.

08:12.868 --> 08:14.536
I know how that is.

08:14.870 --> 08:18.373
I had that problem too,
before I got my own business.

08:19.374 --> 08:21.710
I'll take these back to the truck.

08:26.381 --> 08:28.050
I'm gonna see you later?

08:28.884 --> 08:30.677
I hope so.

08:43.065 --> 08:45.400
So you got a new boyfriend now?

08:46.902 --> 08:49.238
Mama gotta have a life too.

08:57.371 --> 08:58.997
I'm trying to get money.

08:59.248 --> 09:02.042
That's all I'm about. I desire sleep.

09:02.251 --> 09:05.921
-Hey, homie. Want some weed?
-No, man. I'm cool.

09:08.423 --> 09:12.594
I ain't gonna make no money here.
There's too many weed mans.

09:13.595 --> 09:15.597
Let's go holler at these hos.

09:23.438 --> 09:24.940
How's moms doing?

09:25.274 --> 09:29.611
She cool.
I think she got a new boyfriend.

09:29.945 --> 09:32.447
Some old thug-ass nigga.

09:32.781 --> 09:35.117
I know she'll want to kick me out.

09:36.118 --> 09:41.123
He'll want to lay up in the house,
move me out so he can get at Mama.

09:43.876 --> 09:47.504
Next thing you know,
he'll be goin' upside her head.

09:49.131 --> 09:50.966
Ain't that the way it go?

09:51.508 --> 09:55.262
Why are you still with him?
You're always at the clinic.

09:55.470 --> 09:59.141
It ain't Jody's fault.
It take two.

09:59.808 --> 10:01.393
I stopped taking my pills.

10:01.602 --> 10:04.104
There you go blaming yourself again.

10:04.313 --> 10:08.108
How many times do you call on
the phone about his ass?

10:08.317 --> 10:13.155
Cut him loose. I don 't care
if you got a baby. He don 't own you.

10:13.447 --> 10:17.910
Look, Jody don't put his hands on me,
no matter how mad he get.

10:18.118 --> 10:19.453
He ain't crazy.

10:19.661 --> 10:23.123
Bitch, how long you been with Chris?
Three years?

10:23.332 --> 10:27.336
How many times has that nigga gone
upside your head?

10:27.669 --> 10:29.254
How's your eye feel?

10:29.838 --> 10:32.341
It's all right. It's all right.

10:32.674 --> 10:35.511
Shit. At least we living together.

10:35.719 --> 10:39.473
He just want to play with your life
and string you along.

10:39.681 --> 10:43.143
He with his other baby's mama
when he ain't with you.

10:43.519 --> 10:46.188
Please believe. He don't love that ho.

10:46.522 --> 10:50.817
Oh, but he love you, though.
You need to check him.

10:50.984 --> 10:52.861
What's he say about moving in?

10:53.153 --> 10:56.698
Jody wants to live with his mama,
not with me.

10:57.866 --> 11:00.035
Jody, my Jody.

11:00.369 --> 11:04.039
He's a mama's boy.
He'll never leave his mama.

11:04.373 --> 11:09.878
Then let him fuck his mama.
Have her ass up at the clinic. Shit!

12:11.106 --> 12:12.274
I love you, Jody.

12:12.482 --> 12:13.483
I love you too.

12:14.776 --> 12:15.861
I want you to have my baby.

12:16.111 --> 12:17.905
I want to have your baby.

12:18.113 --> 12:19.448
I want to have your baby.

12:20.949 --> 12:21.909
I love you, Jody.

12:22.117 --> 12:23.118
I love you.

12:23.410 --> 12:24.745
I love you too.

12:24.953 --> 12:27.247
I love you, Jody, but you scare me.

12:27.456 --> 12:28.749
You scare me.

12:51.980 --> 12:54.149
No, that's my baby.

12:57.319 --> 12:58.820
Oh, my baby.

12:59.112 --> 13:00.447
Don't cry, Mama.

13:00.656 --> 13:04.660
Give him back!
God, please, give him back!

13:08.497 --> 13:10.165
Jody!

13:21.510 --> 13:24.012
Can I have my car
so I can get to work?

13:24.304 --> 13:25.264
Your car?

13:25.514 --> 13:26.515
My car!

13:26.974 --> 13:29.935
Go on with all that, girl.
I'm here asleep.

13:30.185 --> 13:32.271
It's Monday. I can't be late.

13:32.521 --> 13:35.858
Monday? What's that supposed to mean?

13:36.149 --> 13:37.526
Get up!

13:39.152 --> 13:40.779
Please be on time.

13:41.154 --> 13:43.490
I'm always on time, Yvette.

13:43.907 --> 13:45.826
Don't have me waiting.

13:46.159 --> 13:47.995
Give me some sugar.

13:56.837 --> 13:58.297
-Love you.
-I love you too.

13:58.589 --> 14:00.591
You gonna have a good day?

14:00.841 --> 14:04.178
Be good. Listen to Daddy.
I love you.

14:04.511 --> 14:06.138
Love you too, Mommy.

14:06.430 --> 14:08.098
Thumbs up. My man.

14:08.765 --> 14:10.184
You be good too.

14:10.517 --> 14:13.353
-I'm always good, baby.
-Yeah, right.

14:16.523 --> 14:18.692
Come in front, little man.

14:19.693 --> 14:21.820
Young baller, future shot caller.

14:22.112 --> 14:23.947
5:05, Jody. Don't be late.

14:36.460 --> 14:40.005
You want to nod your head too?
That's my boy.

14:43.133 --> 14:45.385
Wait a minute, Jody!
Hold it! Shit!

14:45.719 --> 14:48.347
You got a man out here waiting.

14:50.724 --> 14:52.559
How do I look?

14:53.393 --> 14:55.020
Okay. Where you going?

14:55.395 --> 14:58.815
I don't know. I'm just going.
He asked and I'm going.

14:59.066 --> 15:01.527
Necklace or no necklace?
You don't know.

15:01.818 --> 15:04.988
Why don't you know
where he's taking you?

15:05.405 --> 15:08.742
How'd you know to wear
that tight-ass dress?

15:09.076 --> 15:13.705
This is an all-purpose dress. I am
prepared for anything in this dress.

15:14.081 --> 15:17.835
He likes music, so we're probably
gonna hear music.

15:18.418 --> 15:21.880
You know where he live?
Been to his house yet?

15:22.422 --> 15:26.885
What you know besides him
smiling at you? He could be crazy.

15:27.261 --> 15:29.137
Is he a killer like Henry?

15:30.264 --> 15:32.891
Why don't you get an L-7 boyfriend?

15:33.267 --> 15:36.228
A white-collar brother
with a briefcase.

15:38.105 --> 15:40.941
You like them thugs.
I don't know why.

15:41.275 --> 15:45.529
Your daddy was a thug. I need a man
who can handle a woman like me.

15:45.779 --> 15:48.407
He's got to be a thug to handle you?

15:48.782 --> 15:51.743
Melvin's not a thug. He's a nice guy.

15:52.119 --> 15:56.874
I'm going out, that's all I know.
That's all I need to know.

15:57.124 --> 16:01.086
I got a date. I look "okay"?
I look good.

16:12.639 --> 16:14.266
What's up, man?

16:19.313 --> 16:21.148
Them's some nice shoes.

16:21.481 --> 16:22.608
Stacey Adams.

16:22.900 --> 16:24.735
Stacey Adams, huh?

16:25.152 --> 16:26.486
OG style.

16:29.823 --> 16:31.283
So where y'all going?

16:31.575 --> 16:35.704
I'm taking her to a club on Crenshaw,
listen to some music.

16:35.913 --> 16:37.581
My partner's in a band there.

16:37.831 --> 16:42.461
That's good. That's real good.
My mama likes to dance.

16:42.836 --> 16:45.130
I asked 'cause I just met you...

16:45.339 --> 16:48.884
...and I didn't want to
chaperon you old folks.

16:56.266 --> 16:57.601
That's my brother, Ray.

16:58.018 --> 17:02.272
He lived here until Mama kicked
him out over her last boyfriend.

17:04.525 --> 17:05.776
He dead now.

17:07.361 --> 17:08.987
My brother, I mean.

17:11.198 --> 17:13.157
So where you live, man?

17:14.034 --> 17:15.661
I live in Inglewood.

17:16.537 --> 17:21.375
I grew up on 101st and Vermont.
The Hoovers.

17:23.710 --> 17:26.046
That was a long time ago.

17:26.547 --> 17:28.173
I was young...

17:29.216 --> 17:30.300
...and dumb.

17:32.719 --> 17:35.180
Jody, are you messin' with my date?

17:35.556 --> 17:39.017
No, I'm keeping him company.
Playing the host.

17:39.393 --> 17:43.230
Nobody likes sitting up here,
waiting alone.

17:43.397 --> 17:47.317
Why can't women be ready on time?
They always make us wait.

17:47.526 --> 17:49.236
Whatever, Jody.

17:59.913 --> 18:02.457
All right, y'all have a good time.

18:03.667 --> 18:05.210
Mama, remember your curfew.

18:08.422 --> 18:11.133
You need money?
I got some change for you.

18:11.341 --> 18:13.385
Jody, you ain't got no money.

18:13.594 --> 18:17.723
Bring me back a Fatburger,
on the real, little cheese.

18:18.098 --> 18:19.725
Go in the house!

18:21.268 --> 18:23.604
You be careful with my mama, man.

18:29.776 --> 18:33.739
Got that pure cake.
No butter, no sugar.

18:34.114 --> 18:37.451
Straight, like my brother's soul.
We got pound cake.

18:37.784 --> 18:40.746
-Give me some pound cake.
-Here you go, brother.

18:40.954 --> 18:43.582
Thank you, brother.
Have a good day.

18:49.796 --> 18:52.132
Today I begin a new life.

18:52.799 --> 18:55.135
I am the master of my abilities...

18:55.469 --> 18:58.805
...and today will be a great
and beautiful day.

18:59.139 --> 19:00.265
What?

19:01.808 --> 19:05.062
I said, today I begin a new life.

19:05.479 --> 19:07.606
I am the master of my abilities...

19:07.981 --> 19:10.943
...and today will be a great
and beautiful day.

19:11.318 --> 19:14.279
Pillows, pillows. Goose down, $35.

19:18.992 --> 19:21.119
Pea, are you a buyer or a seller?

19:21.495 --> 19:22.454
What?

19:22.829 --> 19:24.790
Videos, homie. Videos.

19:25.165 --> 19:28.502
DVD, CDs, Master P,
Charlie's Angels.

19:34.174 --> 19:35.801
Look at yourself.

19:37.177 --> 19:39.429
How many millionaires you got on?

19:40.180 --> 19:42.140
I count at least three.

19:43.183 --> 19:45.143
What are you talking about?

19:45.519 --> 19:48.355
Pea! Look around, man.

19:50.023 --> 19:53.360
You see what I see? I see money.

19:54.695 --> 19:57.406
Look at my man there selling T-shirts.

19:57.614 --> 20:02.035
A brother selling pies and papers.
Cake Man over there.

20:02.536 --> 20:05.873
Everybody moving, making money, right?

20:06.206 --> 20:09.209
While we standing still, being broke.

20:10.711 --> 20:14.047
I figured all this shit out, man.
All this.

20:14.548 --> 20:17.885
The world moves forward
through transactions.

20:18.218 --> 20:19.845
Commerce, nigga.

20:20.554 --> 20:22.890
The exchange of goods and services.

20:23.223 --> 20:27.352
All the real ballin',
successful folks are sellers.

20:27.895 --> 20:31.356
All the broke people playing
catch-up are buyers.

20:32.733 --> 20:37.362
I ain't trying to go out like that.
I'm gonna be a seller.

20:39.239 --> 20:41.575
I'm gonna get my own business.

20:42.576 --> 20:44.536
Change the game.

20:45.078 --> 20:46.914
You want to sell clothes?

20:47.164 --> 20:51.835
Like the man who came to the phone
company selling dresses. Remember?

20:52.085 --> 20:53.045
Cute ass.

20:53.337 --> 20:56.507
-Women's or men's clothes?
-Women's.

20:56.757 --> 20:59.134
Women buy clothes every other day.

20:59.343 --> 21:01.762
But you need to know about women.

21:02.012 --> 21:03.847
I know all about females.

21:04.097 --> 21:05.432
You hear your son?

21:05.682 --> 21:07.726
-You're a bad boy.
-Believe me.

21:08.018 --> 21:11.438
Are you trying to be a salesman
or a shyster?

21:11.688 --> 21:14.858
You buy from a shyster,
you feel like you got took.

21:15.108 --> 21:18.070
You buy from a good salesman
and you feel lucky.

21:18.362 --> 21:20.864
A good salesman makes you
feel so good...

21:21.114 --> 21:24.576
...you'll go back again to give
more and more money.

21:24.868 --> 21:26.411
That sounds like sex.

21:26.787 --> 21:29.248
-What else should I know?
-Sizes.

21:29.456 --> 21:32.292
You gotta know a woman's size
on sight.

21:32.501 --> 21:35.420
Don't wait for her to tell you.
Just know.

21:35.629 --> 21:39.675
-Compliment them, even if they ugly.
-Especially if they are.

21:39.883 --> 21:41.885
-Like Bernice.
-She's big.

21:42.135 --> 21:44.096
They'll be your regulars.

21:44.388 --> 21:48.058
You need to know her favorite
color, what's in season....

21:48.308 --> 21:51.061
And fabrics.
How it feels on our skin.

21:51.645 --> 21:53.605
What's an average size?

21:53.981 --> 21:56.358
I'm a size 5-6. That's average.

21:56.650 --> 21:58.986
For who? A white girl?

21:59.319 --> 22:03.156
Jody, I'm a size 1 6
and that's average too.

22:03.407 --> 22:07.077
-Remember that, you'll make money.
-It's best on payday.

22:15.669 --> 22:17.004
Rachel?

22:18.672 --> 22:21.633
My name is Joseph Summers.
My friends call me Jody.

22:22.009 --> 22:24.344
You want to be my friend?

22:25.179 --> 22:28.140
I wonder if I could
talk to your customers...

22:28.432 --> 22:30.767
...show them my merchandise.

22:31.018 --> 22:35.856
I didn't want to come in and talk
to people without your blessing.

22:36.064 --> 22:37.191
What you selling?

22:38.358 --> 22:41.320
You see this? That's your color.

22:42.029 --> 22:45.866
You're an earth-tone woman.
It match your hair.

22:46.200 --> 22:49.745
Feel how soft that is right there.
See that?

22:50.204 --> 22:52.664
See? See how soft that is?

22:53.040 --> 22:55.167
This is from Paris, France.

22:55.375 --> 22:58.295
You'll change the game with this.
It's couture.

22:59.546 --> 23:03.884
Girl, that's polyester blend.
You pop it in the dryer and go.

23:04.218 --> 23:06.178
This dress is perfect for you.

23:06.553 --> 23:10.015
It's an all-purpose style.
All-purpose dress.

23:10.390 --> 23:12.226
You know what that means?

23:12.559 --> 23:15.646
You can wear it to work,
go straight to happy hour.

23:15.896 --> 23:19.233
Them pants got happy hour
written all over them.

23:20.067 --> 23:23.529
Baby, I ain't gonna lie to you.

23:24.071 --> 23:27.407
Them is one of a kind. Explosive!

23:28.075 --> 23:31.537
You see anyone with them pants on,
you can come bite me.

23:31.828 --> 23:33.497
It ain't happening.

23:35.582 --> 23:36.917
How much?

23:37.918 --> 23:39.670
I'll let it go for $40.

23:39.920 --> 23:41.547
Forty dollars?!

23:42.756 --> 23:47.219
Look, $35. That's the lowest I can go.
You're killing me.

23:48.595 --> 23:50.222
Okay, 35.

23:53.767 --> 23:57.396
Thank you.
I'll squeeze my tiny ass in this...

23:57.771 --> 24:01.608
...and upstage these bitches in here.
You like it? Cute.

24:03.443 --> 24:04.778
One...

24:05.112 --> 24:06.947
...two hundred, three....

24:07.281 --> 24:09.241
That's four hundred dollars!

24:09.616 --> 24:11.952
That is crazy!

24:18.625 --> 24:23.255
Lord, that's crazy.
That is crazy. Okay.

24:48.155 --> 24:49.489
Come on, dog.

24:58.999 --> 25:00.626
I like!

25:03.754 --> 25:06.798
It look good.
Your mama look fly, don't she?

25:07.508 --> 25:08.967
Your mama look good?

25:10.427 --> 25:12.804
-I got another surprise.
-What?

25:13.013 --> 25:17.976
That beautiful dress, my son looking
nice.... We're doing big things!

25:18.352 --> 25:19.978
What'd you do to my car?

25:20.354 --> 25:22.814
I got them tinted windows done.

25:23.190 --> 25:26.151
I got some 1 0s from my Mexican homies.

25:35.035 --> 25:38.372
I told you she'd like that.
Daddy got taste.

25:59.059 --> 26:00.269
Want some breakfast?

26:37.764 --> 26:40.726
--I learned so many
incredible secrets.

26:41.101 --> 26:43.228
When placing ads in newspapers...

26:43.604 --> 26:47.941
...just one secret I can show you
can make you a fortune.

26:48.275 --> 26:51.236
Nice, huh? State of the art.

26:52.613 --> 26:54.573
Yeah. This is the bomb.

26:55.532 --> 27:00.204
-Mama didn't say she got a new TV.
-She didn't know. It's a surprise.

27:00.454 --> 27:01.788
Oh, yeah?

27:02.789 --> 27:06.126
I have to hook up the VCR
and set the timer...

27:06.460 --> 27:08.086
...so she can see--

27:08.378 --> 27:13.133
I hooked it up and set it already.
Pass the remote, youngster.

27:13.467 --> 27:15.302
Let me show you how it works.

27:16.803 --> 27:20.265
I got this bad boy
from my man for free.

27:20.641 --> 27:25.479
You know how much it costs
in one of them electronic stores?

27:25.812 --> 27:28.649
-It cost a grip.
-You got that right.

27:28.982 --> 27:32.611
But we black folks
live by the barter system.

27:32.986 --> 27:35.072
You know about that?

27:35.322 --> 27:39.576
When black folks had no money,
we traded for things.

27:39.785 --> 27:44.289
My man give me this TV 'cause I did
some work for him back in the day.

27:44.498 --> 27:49.461
You know, shot a couple niggas,
cut up some folk. Dumb shit.

27:49.670 --> 27:54.508
I was like you, Jody.
Young, dumb and out of control.

27:55.008 --> 27:56.969
I did a dime.

27:57.344 --> 28:00.681
Ten years straight
in San Quentin and Folsom.

28:01.014 --> 28:04.476
All over some dumb shit. But you?

28:04.726 --> 28:07.563
You're smarter than I was at your age.

28:07.771 --> 28:10.983
I gotta hand it to you.
You're smart.

28:11.191 --> 28:13.819
You're no killer like me. That's good.

28:14.027 --> 28:17.030
I was bad.
I ain't had my dome straight.

28:17.239 --> 28:20.576
But, Jody, peep this. On the real.

28:21.577 --> 28:25.247
Me and your mama
are getting real serious...

28:25.914 --> 28:29.418
...so I'm gonna be
around here for a while.

28:29.918 --> 28:35.090
I ain't trying to be your daddy
or nothing, but if you need advice...

28:36.216 --> 28:38.177
...feel free to talk to me.

28:38.760 --> 28:40.929
'Cause I seen it all...

28:41.430 --> 28:43.765
...and I done it all to the full.

28:44.099 --> 28:48.270
You may think you see new shit
out here, but it's just...

28:48.478 --> 28:50.272
...a rerun to me.

28:53.275 --> 28:55.235
You know what I'm saying?

29:21.803 --> 29:22.804
Mama?

29:23.138 --> 29:28.143
Mama, have you got this nigga
living up in here now?

29:28.435 --> 29:31.063
-Can't I have a life?
-You got a life!

29:31.313 --> 29:36.318
Them days are over. I ain't
like Big Mama. I got to have fun.

29:36.652 --> 29:38.987
You have fun. Why can't I?

29:39.196 --> 29:42.324
But why does the man
have to live here?

29:42.658 --> 29:46.578
He a killer,
and you got him in the kitchen...

29:46.787 --> 29:49.790
...scrambling eggs
and drinking the Kool-Aid?

29:49.998 --> 29:51.834
He was making me breakfast!

29:52.167 --> 29:53.335
All right.

29:55.337 --> 29:59.633
What am I supposed to do?
Roll over and die?

29:59.842 --> 30:01.301
You gonna kick me out?

30:02.302 --> 30:04.304
You gonna kick me out?

30:04.513 --> 30:08.141
Let me know now.
I don't need no surprises.

30:08.350 --> 30:10.811
I do. Surprise me and move out.

30:12.980 --> 30:14.982
You could learn from Melvin.

30:15.315 --> 30:20.320
He's done well for himself.
He's turned his life around.

30:20.529 --> 30:25.617
He has his own business. I don't have
to force him to get a job!

30:31.373 --> 30:35.335
You're not a baby no more, Jody.
You need to grow up.

30:35.544 --> 30:40.883
You got your own family. Why don't you
and Yvette get a place together?

30:44.553 --> 30:49.224
Why are you so afraid to grow up
and be a man? Leave the nest.

30:49.558 --> 30:51.393
I am a man.

30:56.231 --> 30:58.150
So you're kicking me out?

30:58.734 --> 31:03.739
What for? To be with this nigga?
You don't even know him.

31:04.740 --> 31:09.870
What do you mean, "leave the nest"?
You didn't! This is Grandma's house!

31:10.078 --> 31:12.915
I don't have to leave
if you never did!

31:13.749 --> 31:15.834
What are you talking about?

31:17.085 --> 31:18.670
Mama needs a life too.

31:18.921 --> 31:20.589
Fuck you, bro.

31:21.215 --> 31:23.550
Can you tell your son something?

31:23.800 --> 31:25.969
No, I'm not in it.

31:26.220 --> 31:31.183
But why he do the things he do,
Miss Juanita? You must know.

31:31.558 --> 31:36.021
I don 't know what to do.
I love him, but how much can I take?

31:36.396 --> 31:37.940
I can't believe this!

31:38.148 --> 31:41.276
I told you, I won't be
in y'all's business.

31:41.485 --> 31:45.489
What's between you and Jody
is you and Jody.

31:45.822 --> 31:48.492
What do I do with his selfish ass?

31:48.825 --> 31:52.621
He got me and his son walking
while he rolling in my car.

31:52.829 --> 31:57.668
The car I'm paying the note on.
Man, I feel so stupid.

31:58.836 --> 32:00.838
You ain't stupid, Yvette.

32:02.840 --> 32:05.342
You're just in love with a man.

32:10.681 --> 32:15.310
When you in love with a man,
he can make you feel high.

32:15.519 --> 32:18.689
So high you just be in outer space.

32:21.358 --> 32:24.152
But he can also make you feel low.

32:25.195 --> 32:28.031
Real low. And he can keep you there.

32:28.365 --> 32:29.700
Keep you down.

32:30.200 --> 32:31.869
If you let him.

32:32.536 --> 32:36.874
But don't even worry about feeling
used. It's just temporary.

32:37.207 --> 32:40.335
We all get used.
Men use women, women use men.

32:40.544 --> 32:43.005
Just accept that you'll be used.

32:43.213 --> 32:46.675
But if you feel so used
that you got nothing left...

32:46.884 --> 32:51.221
...if the man ain't giving you
the energy you need to love him...

32:51.555 --> 32:55.517
...even when he's acting
like a bastard, you need to let go.

32:55.726 --> 32:59.730
If you ain't got nothing to give
yourself or your baby...

33:00.063 --> 33:02.900
...you won't have it to give to him.

33:08.238 --> 33:10.073
Good boy. Now the corn.

33:10.324 --> 33:13.327
Did you finish the tomatoes?
There you go.

33:13.577 --> 33:16.580
Thattaboy. A little more water
on the greens.

33:16.914 --> 33:19.583
Hi, Juanita. Where's my baby?

33:24.922 --> 33:26.757
Hey, Mama.

33:38.769 --> 33:42.648
Bring my grandbaby here
so I can kiss her goodbye.

33:44.107 --> 33:45.609
Bye, sweetness.

33:45.943 --> 33:47.611
Be a good girl.

33:53.951 --> 33:55.619
Ooh, Melvin!

33:57.287 --> 33:58.956
Oh, baby.

33:59.581 --> 34:03.794
-You gonna give me a cavity.
-Oh, yes, baby. Melvin!

34:04.127 --> 34:06.630
Okay, circles. Around and around.

34:06.964 --> 34:09.299
Take it, take it. You ride.

34:09.550 --> 34:11.051
I love to ride!

34:12.719 --> 34:16.681
It's the African squat fuck.
The old nigger squat fuck.

34:21.311 --> 34:23.313
Squat, baby. Squat, baby.

34:23.647 --> 34:27.317
Can y'all keep it down?
People are trying to sleep!

34:27.650 --> 34:28.985
Let me down, baby.

34:29.235 --> 34:30.404
Fuck!

34:30.737 --> 34:34.324
--and that she was impressed.
Broke her off.

34:34.658 --> 34:36.659
Made her feel good.

34:36.994 --> 34:39.663
Now I got myself a regular customer.

34:47.004 --> 34:49.339
What the hell is he looking at?

34:50.674 --> 34:55.971
Trying to psych me out, talking about
being a killer. Old-school nigga.

34:56.179 --> 35:00.184
He don't want us to have
to put heat on his ass, do he?

35:00.517 --> 35:02.269
Want me to take him out?

35:04.021 --> 35:05.856
Let the nigga breathe.

35:07.191 --> 35:11.862
He make my mama unhappy, we make
his ass bleed. On the real.

35:12.196 --> 35:17.492
Make him feel the steel.
Long as she happy, he got his life.

35:17.701 --> 35:19.369
Won't be no strife.

35:20.537 --> 35:23.207
And I hope his ass hear me too.

35:25.042 --> 35:26.543
I hear you.

35:29.213 --> 35:31.465
You know your problem?

35:31.882 --> 35:36.762
You think you know everything,
but you don't know shit.

35:37.554 --> 35:41.892
I see you got a little business
going. Well, that's good.

35:42.226 --> 35:44.228
You make that paper.

35:44.478 --> 35:48.190
But when you making paper,
there's rules that go with it.

35:48.398 --> 35:52.736
You gotta learn the difference
between guns and butter.

35:53.904 --> 35:59.243
There are two types of niggas. Those
with guns, and those with butter.

35:59.743 --> 36:04.248
What are the guns?
That's the real estate.

36:04.581 --> 36:07.584
The stocks and bonds. Art work.

36:07.918 --> 36:10.754
Shit that appreciates in value.

36:11.088 --> 36:12.756
What's the butter?

36:13.090 --> 36:18.720
Cars, clothes, all the other bullshit
that don't mean shit later.

36:18.929 --> 36:22.516
That's what it's all about.
Guns and butter.

36:22.766 --> 36:25.269
You little dumb motherfuckers.

36:31.108 --> 36:33.318
See what I'm sayin', cuz?

36:33.944 --> 36:37.114
This nigga doing this shit
every night.

36:37.531 --> 36:38.866
What?

36:42.202 --> 36:45.372
Why can't you just
sit still and relax?

36:45.581 --> 36:47.457
Don't complain.
You left me here all weekend!

36:47.457 --> 36:48.667
Don't complain.
You left me here all weekend!

36:48.876 --> 36:50.794
Why can't you sit still?

36:51.003 --> 36:54.089
That's what divides us
as a people. No focus.

36:54.298 --> 36:59.052
Why don't you sit down and focus?
Watch some PBS or something.

36:59.261 --> 37:03.182
You so full of shit.
So fucking selfish.

37:03.390 --> 37:04.892
What's this old pizza?

37:05.142 --> 37:09.980
Since you're starting shit,
where you been since yesterday?

37:11.648 --> 37:13.984
Slinging dresses, making money.

37:14.484 --> 37:17.613
Got the brakes fixed.
What you been doing?

37:17.821 --> 37:19.990
-You been fucking around?
-Nope.

37:20.199 --> 37:22.034
Let me smell your dick.

37:22.492 --> 37:23.911
Go on with that.

37:24.161 --> 37:28.999
If you ain't been whoring around,
let me smell your dick. I can tell.

37:29.249 --> 37:30.250
Go on.

37:30.501 --> 37:35.005
I ain't playing with you. Move!
I'll knock your ass out.

37:39.009 --> 37:41.678
See? My shit smells good, don't it?

37:42.012 --> 37:45.557
See what? You probably washed it off.

37:48.185 --> 37:51.063
I'm tired of you messing around on me.

37:51.855 --> 37:55.275
I know you and Sweetpea was out
doing me wrong.

37:55.442 --> 37:56.985
I didn't do nothing.

37:57.194 --> 38:01.949
You gonna sit there with
a straight face and say that?

38:02.699 --> 38:07.204
I didn't do nothing.
I was over at Kim's, playing spades.

38:07.538 --> 38:11.375
You're a liar!
You went to that after-hours spot.

38:11.708 --> 38:15.712
Some nasty heifer was
shaking her ass in your face...

38:15.921 --> 38:19.299
...then you went to a private room
with the bitch...

38:19.508 --> 38:21.343
...and did I don't know what!

38:21.552 --> 38:26.473
I know 'cause Chris was there.
Sharika's Chris? He saw you.

38:26.640 --> 38:30.894
You busted.
It's all on your grill, stupid.

38:32.396 --> 38:33.647
All right.

38:34.398 --> 38:37.401
I was there. But I didn't fuck.

38:37.901 --> 38:40.821
She just danced for me, that's all.

38:40.988 --> 38:45.325
-Did you touch her?
-Hell, no. That nasty girl?

38:45.742 --> 38:50.080
We can't touch them anyway.
It's against the rules.

38:51.748 --> 38:55.460
Private dance, that's all.
Just a quick lap dance.

38:57.087 --> 39:00.757
You don't believe me?
It's the truth. I didn't fuck!

39:01.091 --> 39:05.304
It was a private dance, in the corner.
I didn't do shit.

39:05.512 --> 39:08.473
You must take me
for some kind of fool.

39:08.849 --> 39:12.436
You foul. I smell
your dirty ass from here.

39:12.686 --> 39:15.564
Why you got to be around
them nasty girls?

39:15.772 --> 39:18.775
They do that shit every night, dummy.

39:19.026 --> 39:21.987
You know how many dicks
they suck every night?

39:22.362 --> 39:26.491
And you go down there like
the rest of them fools!

39:27.117 --> 39:30.579
You better not bring me nothing
from them bitches.

39:30.787 --> 39:32.998
Fuck it then! Don't believe me.

39:33.207 --> 39:37.503
I said I didn't fuck that girl.
Stop putting your hands on me.

39:37.711 --> 39:38.921
Where you going?!

39:39.379 --> 39:43.217
I hate you!
You're selfish, arrogant and stupid!

39:43.550 --> 39:46.011
-Whatever.
-I don't need you!

39:46.220 --> 39:50.474
I'm tired of sitting here,
not having a man with me.

39:50.682 --> 39:54.686
Being lonely. I'm gonna do
what the fuck I wanna do.

39:54.895 --> 39:56.855
What are you gonna do?

39:57.231 --> 40:01.193
I said I'm tired of waiting
for your ass. I hate you.

40:01.401 --> 40:03.028
I'm gonna have me a man.

40:03.403 --> 40:06.532
A man who wants to be with me
and my baby...

40:06.740 --> 40:09.868
...and have a family.
A real man, Jody.

40:10.077 --> 40:13.872
Not some little boy, still living
at home with his mama.

40:14.081 --> 40:16.041
Fuck you! Kiss my ass!

40:16.416 --> 40:21.547
Go out on the streets and be a trick.
I should knock you the fuck out.

40:21.755 --> 40:25.217
You better not, or I'll call your
probation officer...

40:25.425 --> 40:29.263
...and they'll put you
back in jail! Now....

40:29.429 --> 40:31.557
Kiss my ass, nigga!

40:31.890 --> 40:36.061
You better walk away. I hate you!
You so stupid!

40:36.562 --> 40:39.231
You hate me? Keep on saying that shit.

40:39.439 --> 40:42.568
That's right. I hate your ass.

40:42.776 --> 40:46.405
You make me sick.
I can't stand your black ass!

40:46.947 --> 40:50.617
You act like a little boy
instead of a grown man.

40:50.826 --> 40:52.119
I hate you!

40:52.327 --> 40:56.290
You know what? I hate your ass too.
Do something.

40:59.293 --> 41:02.045
Give me my keys. You ain't going--

41:02.254 --> 41:05.632
Get off me! There you go,
coming downstairs...

41:05.799 --> 41:08.802
...showing off before the neighbors.

41:09.011 --> 41:12.181
-Fuck them! I hate you!
-I hate you too!

41:12.389 --> 41:15.058
I love you! I love you so much!

41:15.392 --> 41:18.103
I love you too. I ain't going nowhere.

41:19.646 --> 41:22.816
-You feel him?
-Yes, I feel him.

41:23.066 --> 41:24.234
You feel him?

41:24.484 --> 41:26.987
Oh, my God, I feel him! He big!

41:27.237 --> 41:29.239
-What do you feel?
-Daddy Dick.

41:29.489 --> 41:31.700
-You love Daddy Dick?
-I love him.

41:31.909 --> 41:34.203
-You say it.
-I love Daddy Dick.

41:34.411 --> 41:36.830
You gonna clean all that mess up?

41:36.997 --> 41:40.209
-I'll clean up!
-You gonna cook some tacos?

41:40.417 --> 41:43.587
My God! I'm about to come.
I'm gonna come!

41:44.254 --> 41:45.964
Yes, I'll make the tacos!

41:50.928 --> 41:52.763
Oh, my God....

41:53.931 --> 41:55.849
I could bite you right now.

41:56.600 --> 41:58.268
Damn, boy. Shit!

41:58.602 --> 42:00.270
Now what?

42:01.396 --> 42:04.233
That's the beat-it-up-white dance.

42:04.441 --> 42:06.777
You are so stupid.

42:07.945 --> 42:11.365
I was over there to the right.
Did you feel me?

42:11.615 --> 42:15.702
-I see you ain't going nowhere.
-That's 'cause I'm sprung.

42:15.953 --> 42:19.873
So you're gonna clean up that mess
and make tacos, right?

42:20.040 --> 42:23.252
I'm gonna cook and clean.
You put it down.

42:23.460 --> 42:27.464
I'll feed you, you big old monster.
I love you, boy.

42:27.798 --> 42:29.132
I love you too.

42:29.466 --> 42:32.469
-Bring that chocolate here.
-I'm on my way.

42:32.719 --> 42:36.306
Come here. Just make sure
you can handle me.

42:36.640 --> 42:39.184
You trying to go for round two?

42:45.148 --> 42:50.112
Jody, when I say I hate you, what
I really mean is that I love you.

42:50.320 --> 42:54.157
But you scare me. It's like
we ain't gonna be together.

42:55.492 --> 42:57.494
I'm trying to sleep.

42:58.161 --> 43:02.624
We'll always be together.
Unless I get killed or something.

43:02.833 --> 43:07.838
Don't talk like that.
Don't even play around like that.

43:09.006 --> 43:11.675
I'd go crazy if something happened.

43:11.884 --> 43:16.013
On the real, you know why
I made you have Joe-Joe?

43:17.347 --> 43:21.310
I thought I was gonna get shot
out in these streets.

43:21.518 --> 43:26.190
I wanted a piece of me to still
be here, even if I was gone.

43:27.524 --> 43:32.487
When he was born, I was like, "Cool.
No matter what happens to me...

43:32.696 --> 43:35.532
...I'll still be here in some way."

43:35.866 --> 43:39.411
So if something happened to you,
what about me?

43:41.038 --> 43:42.706
You'd be all right.

43:43.874 --> 43:45.542
Go to sleep.

44:44.768 --> 44:47.396
You don't want me here? Kick me out!

44:47.604 --> 44:50.524
Shut up, Pea! Nobody said that!

44:50.732 --> 44:54.069
Y'all in there-- What?
Sinuating? lnsinuating?

44:54.278 --> 44:56.363
Fuck it. I'll leave.

44:56.572 --> 44:59.616
-You need to shut up.
-No, you do.

44:59.867 --> 45:03.078
You're the one talking
loud and making noise.

45:03.287 --> 45:05.122
Are you back-talking me?

45:05.330 --> 45:08.709
Huh? You don't know how
to act towards your man?

45:08.917 --> 45:12.504
I'll put my foot so far up your--
Come on in, Jody.

45:14.131 --> 45:18.093
A houseful of women!
Houseful of sensitive females...

45:18.302 --> 45:22.347
...dealing with they damn hormones!
Y'all unstable creatures!

45:22.556 --> 45:27.352
I won't say the "B" word. "Unstable
creatures." That's my new word.

45:27.561 --> 45:29.646
Mama, don't say nothing.

45:29.855 --> 45:32.816
You'll make it worse.
He's leaving anyway.

45:33.025 --> 45:37.905
I'm trying to concentrate.
They won't let me be. Want a drink?

45:38.113 --> 45:41.658
-No, I'm cool.
-Why are you acting all shy?

45:41.992 --> 45:45.329
My house is your house
Mi casa es su casa!

45:45.662 --> 45:48.165
I got milk, water, Kool-Aid...

45:48.373 --> 45:52.127
...strawberry soda. I'll get you
a strawberry soda.

45:57.007 --> 45:59.218
I'm sorry, Mrs. Daniels.

45:59.426 --> 46:01.220
I'm so sorry. I love you.

46:01.595 --> 46:05.140
And Kim. In fact, I love you more,
'cause without you...

46:05.349 --> 46:06.892
...Kim wouldn't be here.

46:07.100 --> 46:10.938
Y'all said you love me!
You told me I could stay here!

46:11.104 --> 46:14.399
Bought me new clothes
and the video game!

46:14.608 --> 46:17.694
I thought we had a family!
I got no family!

46:17.903 --> 46:20.906
I'm trying to make that happen
with y'all.

46:21.907 --> 46:24.076
-What, nigga?
-Come here.

46:24.284 --> 46:26.662
I'm talking to my family here.

46:29.206 --> 46:31.124
I love y'all. Both of you.

46:31.291 --> 46:34.169
Come on. I need you to roll with me.

46:35.379 --> 46:37.422
All right, then. I'm leaving.

46:37.714 --> 46:41.510
Let's go get some liquor.
Strippers ain't at work yet.

46:41.718 --> 46:45.264
You don't need liquor.
You're already too fired up.

46:45.472 --> 46:48.183
Who the fuck are you calling fired up?

46:48.392 --> 46:51.603
You're responsible for the shit
they give me.

46:51.812 --> 46:56.525
You still ain't found me no job!
Hook me up with your business!

46:56.733 --> 46:58.861
When you gonna find me a job?

46:59.069 --> 47:02.531
-Why I gotta find you a job?
-'Cause you my man!

47:03.740 --> 47:05.909
Okay. Step to my office.

47:06.243 --> 47:07.911
All right.

47:08.912 --> 47:13.417
You have a mission. I'm gonna give
you one piece of merchandise.

47:13.750 --> 47:16.753
If you can sell it,
we can talk business.

47:18.422 --> 47:21.091
-Sell one thing.
-One thing.

47:21.758 --> 47:23.302
Check it out.

47:23.594 --> 47:28.098
I got dresses, shoes, baby clothes.
Take your pick.

47:30.434 --> 47:32.102
I'll sell this dress.

47:32.352 --> 47:34.855
-Not that.
-I know what I want to sell!

47:35.105 --> 47:39.109
Yes, the original cake.
The original man.

47:39.443 --> 47:41.612
Salaam. Break bread, brother.

47:46.450 --> 47:49.119
Hey, take a look at this dress.
Want to buy it?

47:49.453 --> 47:52.956
-Not my color.
-No, no, hold on. Stand still.

47:53.290 --> 47:55.292
Look at that. That looks good.

47:55.626 --> 47:58.629
I don't want it.
It don't even look in season.

47:58.962 --> 48:01.465
It is. They're wearing this in Paris.

48:01.715 --> 48:05.260
I saw Tyra Banks in this
and you finer than her.

48:11.642 --> 48:13.310
What's the material?

48:13.644 --> 48:16.563
Goddamn! You want to buy
the dress or not?

48:16.730 --> 48:19.733
You treat me like I'm some
fucker asking for change.

48:19.983 --> 48:22.402
I'm doing something constructive.

48:22.569 --> 48:27.074
I could be out knocking folks over,
but I'm trying to live right.

48:27.324 --> 48:30.786
You call that living right?
Selling a stolen dress?

48:31.495 --> 48:35.832
I ain't stole nothing in my life!
I got this from my homeboy.

48:36.166 --> 48:38.669
That's what y'all do? Boost?

48:39.169 --> 48:44.091
Sell stolen stuff? Like that man
there trying to sell that camera?

48:56.019 --> 49:01.024
-You don't want me answering it?
-Go ahead. It's probably for me.

49:01.441 --> 49:04.820
Collect call from
California Correctional Facility.

49:05.028 --> 49:08.574
Correctional Facility?
Do you accept the charges?

49:08.782 --> 49:10.367
Hell, no!

49:11.410 --> 49:14.663
Who's calling you from jail?
That nigga Rodney?

49:14.872 --> 49:17.583
Oh, you don't hear me now? Hello!

49:17.791 --> 49:22.045
Rodney's lonely. He just want
someone to talk to. Don't trip.

49:22.254 --> 49:25.424
That why the phone bill
was an extra $1 00?

49:25.632 --> 49:30.470
I'm paying you to talk to him?
You putting my money on his books too?

49:30.637 --> 49:33.974
Didn't I tell you
to put a block on the phone?

49:34.224 --> 49:36.560
You don't listen to nobody.

49:36.894 --> 49:39.396
Don't even trip.

49:39.730 --> 49:43.400
Collect call from
California Correctional Facility.

49:43.609 --> 49:44.610
I accept.

49:44.902 --> 49:48.947
-Hello, Yvette?
-This ain't no motherfucking Yvette.

49:49.156 --> 49:50.616
Put her on the phone!

49:50.824 --> 49:54.661
This is my house!
Don't ask to speak to my woman!

49:54.828 --> 49:57.831
Your house, nigga?
You don 't even live there.

49:57.998 --> 50:01.877
Is this Jody? The Jody
that got my boo pregnant?

50:02.085 --> 50:05.130
Who won't take his
responsibilities as a man?

50:05.339 --> 50:08.842
Living at your mama's house?
Running around...

50:09.051 --> 50:11.678
...like a little boy? You's a bitch!

50:11.929 --> 50:15.724
Look at you! What you got?
Your ass in jail!

50:15.933 --> 50:18.560
Don't tell me how to handle mine.

50:18.769 --> 50:21.522
Don't call my fucking house no more!

50:21.730 --> 50:24.107
My girl ain't feeling you, cuz!

50:24.316 --> 50:27.736
Nigga, concentrate on
not dropping the soap...

50:27.945 --> 50:29.404
...bitch-ass nigga!

50:29.613 --> 50:31.448
Fuck you, cuz.

50:33.283 --> 50:36.078
I want a block on the fucking phone!

50:36.286 --> 50:37.871
All right, Jody! Damn!

50:38.080 --> 50:42.835
What are you doing, sitting on the
phone, telling him my business?

50:43.043 --> 50:44.378
He's saying :

50:44.545 --> 50:48.507
"You still live with your mama!"
I don't want to hear that!

50:49.800 --> 50:53.804
She's so suspicious.
She always think I'm fucking someone.

50:54.012 --> 50:57.474
I go to the bathroom,
"You got a bitch in there?"

50:57.683 --> 51:01.687
I'm going to the store,
"There a bitch at the store?"

51:03.981 --> 51:08.318
Then I got to come home to Melvin
and his bullshit.

51:10.153 --> 51:11.989
I want to get saved.

51:13.490 --> 51:14.992
Say what, bruh?

51:16.660 --> 51:19.705
Get the fuck out of here!
We're talking.

51:20.664 --> 51:25.335
Poncho! I'll be done with your bike
in an hour. Come back.

51:28.005 --> 51:29.840
I want to be saved, Jody.

51:30.841 --> 51:33.969
I need to be baptized,
so I can go to heaven.

51:34.178 --> 51:36.972
Wash my sins away,
so them gates open up.

51:37.181 --> 51:40.601
I don't want Jesus to say,
"Turn your ass around."

51:41.018 --> 51:44.855
You should do it too.
Get baptized with me.

51:45.856 --> 51:50.903
What did you do, man? You did
something bad to be saying this.

51:51.111 --> 51:55.532
No, I'm trying to keep
from doing something. I need money.

51:55.741 --> 51:57.701
A job to keep me busy.

51:58.035 --> 52:01.330
Something besides
playing Madden all day.

52:01.538 --> 52:06.210
I don't even stay at Kim's house
during the day. I leave at 9 :00.

52:06.418 --> 52:10.506
Come back at 6, acting like
I did something constructive.

52:10.714 --> 52:12.382
Like I'm working.

52:12.633 --> 52:15.969
I ain't did that shit
since continuation school.

52:16.970 --> 52:20.349
Sneaking around Kim and her mama
like I'm a child.

52:20.557 --> 52:25.604
Like I'm a scared little boy. I gotta
ask my woman and her mama for money.

52:25.854 --> 52:30.234
How do you think that makes me feel?
Like a man?

52:31.735 --> 52:36.573
This shit is tearing me up, cuz.
It's eating me alive.

52:37.741 --> 52:40.452
I don't want to end up killing nobody.

52:42.079 --> 52:43.997
What am I gonna do, Jody?

52:48.752 --> 52:51.421
Shit, I was in the same boat too.

52:52.756 --> 52:57.719
You gotta find something you like
to do. Something you're interested in.

52:58.929 --> 53:00.597
Like I did.

53:02.266 --> 53:03.809
What you good at?

53:04.768 --> 53:06.103
Robbing.

53:10.816 --> 53:13.277
-Hey, Jody.
-What's going on?

53:13.485 --> 53:16.947
-What's up, Jody?
-What's going on with you?

53:17.155 --> 53:21.285
-I need some new boots.
-I got you covered with gator, girl!

53:21.493 --> 53:24.496
They might be bootleg,
but I got you, girl!

53:25.330 --> 53:30.252
Dresses! I got some business suits
coming in! You'll love those!

53:31.753 --> 53:34.590
Why are you yakking and talking shit?

53:34.798 --> 53:39.219
I'm trying to make money. When
money come in, you never complain.

53:39.428 --> 53:40.429
Don't be cute.

53:52.900 --> 53:56.028
Nice and quiet. My own little spot.

53:56.236 --> 53:59.698
Watch my tomatoes. Got some wine.

54:06.205 --> 54:09.875
Over there. I think I see
some weeds by the peppers.

54:11.251 --> 54:13.253
Why don't you use Weed-B-Gon?

54:13.462 --> 54:17.424
I'm a natural gardener.
That's how it was done way back.

54:17.591 --> 54:20.511
You get on your knees
and pull them up.

54:20.719 --> 54:24.056
It's what my mom and daddy did.
It's what I do.

54:24.264 --> 54:27.392
Remember to put the weeds
in the compost pile.

54:27.601 --> 54:30.395
You doing nothing
but bossing me around.

54:30.604 --> 54:34.274
I think I'll plant
some summer squash next year.

54:37.236 --> 54:39.738
-Jody, we got to stop this.
-What?

54:39.947 --> 54:42.950
Every time I come out,
you go in the house.

54:43.158 --> 54:45.702
Nobody's thinking about you, bruh.

54:46.036 --> 54:50.040
This is where I relax.
Take that noise somewhere else.

54:50.249 --> 54:54.878
Every time I come out to work
in the garden, he goes in the house.

54:59.132 --> 55:00.759
Give me some wine.

55:11.603 --> 55:13.438
Seven, winner.

55:13.772 --> 55:15.524
Baby, be sweet.

55:15.732 --> 55:19.278
Eleven, winner. Seven, eleven.
That's all I'm rolling.

55:39.339 --> 55:42.467
How come you ain't
brought your kids around?

55:44.052 --> 55:47.431
Don't you got a son, 1 7,
named Duquan?

55:48.140 --> 55:51.059
And a little girl about 5 named Maya?

55:51.727 --> 55:54.813
-You tell my mama about them?
-She know.

55:55.230 --> 55:57.482
Why ain't you brought them around?

55:58.317 --> 56:00.152
You ashamed of them?

56:00.819 --> 56:02.487
They ugly like you?

56:07.826 --> 56:12.497
I don't get along too well
with my babies' mamas.

56:12.831 --> 56:15.834
-I'm sure you understand.
-No, I don't.

56:16.168 --> 56:18.670
I'm cool with both my babies' mamas.

56:18.879 --> 56:22.591
-We'll see how long that lasts.
-Long as I want it to.

56:23.175 --> 56:26.136
But we're talking about you, not me.

56:26.345 --> 56:28.931
I talked to your son the other day.

56:29.723 --> 56:33.644
I heard you say his name
when y'all old niggas was here...

56:33.852 --> 56:35.229
...playing cards.

56:35.562 --> 56:38.690
He live five minutes from here,
in Inglewood.

56:38.899 --> 56:42.945
I drove to Morningside High School
and asked him about you.

56:43.654 --> 56:48.700
He didn't have shit to say about you
'cause you whipped his mama's ass.

56:48.909 --> 56:51.203
What do you think about that?

56:51.870 --> 56:53.747
You gonna beat my mama?

56:55.082 --> 56:59.086
No. I think you know better
than that, don't you?

56:59.586 --> 57:04.591
You want to walk around here with your
chest out, saying you a real man.

57:04.925 --> 57:07.845
Know why I don't like you
around my mama?

57:08.929 --> 57:10.597
'Cause you foul.

57:12.266 --> 57:15.143
You're a dirty motherfucker, Melvin.

57:16.270 --> 57:19.273
Don't think I'll let you
get it in her head...

57:19.565 --> 57:23.235
...to kick me out like
the last nigga did my brother.

57:24.611 --> 57:26.613
'Cause I ain't having it, bruh.

57:27.447 --> 57:30.492
No way, no how.

57:31.118 --> 57:32.786
Ah, youngster.

57:36.957 --> 57:39.251
You get your ass out of here.

57:42.462 --> 57:43.463
Mama!

57:43.755 --> 57:47.092
Yeah, that's right.
Call for your mama.

57:47.926 --> 57:50.679
I stayed off you
out of respect for her.

57:50.888 --> 57:55.601
If not for your mama, I'd have broke
your little ass down long ago.

57:55.809 --> 57:58.312
"Jody? Little Jody?"

57:58.604 --> 58:03.525
Know what I see when I look in your
eyes? A scared little bitch.

58:03.984 --> 58:05.569
That's what I see.

58:05.777 --> 58:09.698
If we was on lock-down,
I'd make you get on your knees.

58:09.907 --> 58:13.994
Twenty years. Let's see
where you be 20 years from now.

58:14.328 --> 58:15.662
Melvin?

58:21.335 --> 58:22.669
What y'all doing?

58:23.670 --> 58:25.005
Nothing.

58:25.297 --> 58:27.758
Can you go get me some cigarettes?

58:27.966 --> 58:31.845
-Maybe some beer. What you doing?
-You're so sweet.

58:33.680 --> 58:35.307
Watch your hands.

58:35.516 --> 58:37.017
Hurry back, okay?

58:42.564 --> 58:44.483
Want anything from the store?

58:47.319 --> 58:48.987
What's up, Jody?

58:49.321 --> 58:51.323
The candles smell good.

58:53.158 --> 58:54.493
Aromatherapy.

58:55.536 --> 58:56.537
You smoke?

58:56.828 --> 58:59.164
No. I don't mess with that.

58:59.498 --> 59:03.919
So you and Yvette got a baby?
Where y'all stay at?

59:04.503 --> 59:06.296
We don't live together.

59:06.839 --> 59:10.133
You ain't gotta lie.
I know y'all live together.

59:10.342 --> 59:13.011
You drop her off
and pick her up every day.

59:13.262 --> 59:17.224
That's just what we do.
I don't want to discuss 'Vette.

59:17.432 --> 59:20.894
We don't need to talk.
I just want some dick.

59:26.525 --> 59:30.696
Why you want to fuck me?
To make my girl mad?

59:31.363 --> 59:33.699
-That what you want to do?
-No!

59:34.867 --> 59:36.535
It ain't like that.

59:36.869 --> 59:41.373
I just think you're cute.
I mean, I see you all the time.

59:42.374 --> 59:44.877
When we was in the parking lot...

59:45.878 --> 59:48.547
...l thought we was feeling
each other.

59:49.214 --> 59:50.883
Was I wrong?

59:54.553 --> 59:56.555
Yeah, I was feeling you.

59:57.389 --> 01:00:00.058
But I ain't feeling this. I'm out.

01:00:01.560 --> 01:00:04.396
Jody, come on. Don't be like that.

01:00:06.398 --> 01:00:08.567
This is just between us.

01:00:09.193 --> 01:00:12.404
I see how you look
when you come around.

01:00:12.613 --> 01:00:15.407
You saying you don't want to hit this?

01:00:15.782 --> 01:00:18.827
Come over here and get this pussy.

01:00:19.203 --> 01:00:22.289
I don't need to go there with you.

01:00:23.957 --> 01:00:25.292
Yvette.

01:00:25.959 --> 01:00:28.754
Besides, I ain't got no condoms.

01:00:28.962 --> 01:00:30.464
No way.

01:00:36.803 --> 01:00:39.431
Somebody don't want to leave.

01:00:50.275 --> 01:00:52.152
Oh, fuck!

01:00:52.361 --> 01:00:54.613
What are you doing, girl?

01:00:57.866 --> 01:00:59.618
I can't do this.

01:01:08.168 --> 01:01:09.503
Oh, shit.

01:01:21.515 --> 01:01:23.684
I know you want this.

01:01:24.351 --> 01:01:25.686
I can't do this.

01:01:27.187 --> 01:01:29.189
I promise it'll be good.

01:01:29.481 --> 01:01:33.527
No, this shit is foul.
It's foul. This shit's wrong!

01:01:34.361 --> 01:01:38.156
Get off me. I can't fuck you.
My girl finds out...

01:01:38.365 --> 01:01:40.951
...she'll kill me.
I love her too much.

01:01:41.159 --> 01:01:45.038
So you a little bitch?
Your girl tells you what to do?

01:01:45.205 --> 01:01:47.207
I told you it was a trick.

01:01:48.208 --> 01:01:49.543
Hood rat.

01:01:51.879 --> 01:01:56.508
I don't need you! I can get
dick any time I want! You want this!

01:01:56.717 --> 01:02:00.012
No, you want this.
You lucky I let you taste it.

01:02:00.220 --> 01:02:02.723
This Daddy Dick belongs to Yvette.

01:02:02.931 --> 01:02:05.517
Not from what I hear, you ho!

01:02:06.018 --> 01:02:07.019
Fuck you!

01:02:07.227 --> 01:02:10.147
You don't know how
to suck dick anyway.

01:02:33.086 --> 01:02:34.880
Why is that bitch staring?

01:02:35.088 --> 01:02:38.008
I don't know,
but she about to get slapped.

01:02:40.052 --> 01:02:41.053
Fuck you.

01:02:41.428 --> 01:02:43.096
No.

01:02:58.403 --> 01:03:01.406
How come you ain't waving
at her today?

01:03:01.615 --> 01:03:03.742
I ain't thinking about her.

01:03:03.951 --> 01:03:08.956
She was staring at me today.
She was about to catch a beat-down.

01:03:10.100 --> 01:03:12.700
I think she's a lesbian for real.

01:03:14.001 --> 01:03:17.504
She want your sweet stuff.
Do some carpet munching.

01:03:17.713 --> 01:03:19.673
Shit! She better get back.

01:03:19.882 --> 01:03:22.718
- All around the world.
- Stop! Nasty!

01:03:23.052 --> 01:03:25.220
- You cooking tonight?
- No.

01:03:25.554 --> 01:03:27.389
- Lazy ass.
- Whatever.

01:03:27.723 --> 01:03:29.516
Let's go to Lucy's then.

01:03:29.725 --> 01:03:32.436
- Cheese enchiladas.
- Strawberry shake.

01:03:36.023 --> 01:03:37.358
I got it.

01:03:38.067 --> 01:03:39.234
No, I got it.

01:03:39.568 --> 01:03:41.570
- No, I got it.
- I got it.

01:03:43.072 --> 01:03:45.407
All right, then. Have it.

01:03:46.408 --> 01:03:50.079
Let me get two steak tacos...

01:03:51.330 --> 01:03:55.000
...a chicken burrito
and two strawberry shakes.

01:03:55.209 --> 01:03:57.086
That'll be $11.89.

01:03:59.588 --> 01:04:02.258
I'm starving. Hungry as hell.

01:04:05.594 --> 01:04:07.263
What's this?

01:04:08.889 --> 01:04:11.058
Condoms. How'd you get that?

01:04:11.267 --> 01:04:14.436
Don't flip this.
What's it doing in my car?

01:04:17.064 --> 01:04:19.275
- Hello!
- Can I get the food?

01:04:24.280 --> 01:04:28.575
I can't believe I fell for that shit
you said the other night.

01:04:28.784 --> 01:04:32.121
How you're gonna do right
by me and Joe-Joe.

01:04:32.454 --> 01:04:34.081
How you won't cheat...

01:04:34.290 --> 01:04:37.793
...not gonna hurt me,
keep breaking my heart.

01:04:38.127 --> 01:04:39.545
What was all that?

01:04:39.753 --> 01:04:42.631
- Writing on the money.
- Give me that!

01:04:42.840 --> 01:04:45.801
This is bullshit. Get the food!

01:04:48.429 --> 01:04:50.097
Thank you so much.

01:04:50.639 --> 01:04:53.309
"Thank you so much." You being funny?

01:04:54.935 --> 01:04:57.771
"Trojan. Very Sensitive. Lubricated.

01:04:57.980 --> 01:05:01.525
America's No. 1 Condom."
At least you went all out.

01:05:01.734 --> 01:05:05.696
All I get is a trip to the clinic.
Give me my shake!

01:05:16.165 --> 01:05:18.000
So who was you fucking?

01:05:18.667 --> 01:05:23.005
Don't lie. You been fucking
somebody in my car, Jody?

01:05:23.339 --> 01:05:24.465
No.

01:05:25.341 --> 01:05:26.675
I don't know.

01:05:27.009 --> 01:05:28.677
You don't know?

01:05:30.012 --> 01:05:33.474
You mean you don't remember
who you were with?

01:05:33.766 --> 01:05:36.310
You been with that many girls?

01:05:38.103 --> 01:05:43.442
I'm tired of you fucking around.
Damn, I want to see other niggas!

01:05:45.110 --> 01:05:48.030
That's right.
They be asking me out too.

01:05:48.238 --> 01:05:51.492
But, no. I'm here,
sticking to your ass!

01:05:51.700 --> 01:05:54.620
- All right. Go out, then.
- Whatever.

01:05:55.204 --> 01:05:57.831
Who did you fuck with these condoms?

01:05:58.040 --> 01:06:02.544
I'm not stupid. This is a
three-pack and there's one left.

01:06:03.087 --> 01:06:04.922
Tell me the truth!

01:06:05.256 --> 01:06:08.050
We're grown. We ain't kids. Be real.

01:06:08.259 --> 01:06:11.095
Be a man for once in your life.

01:06:11.887 --> 01:06:13.681
You still fucking Peanut?

01:06:22.898 --> 01:06:25.442
I know you're still fucking Peanut.

01:06:26.777 --> 01:06:28.946
I figured that much.

01:06:30.114 --> 01:06:34.118
I ain't even mad at you,
'cause I already knew that.

01:06:34.952 --> 01:06:38.789
Did you fuck her
with these condoms in my car?

01:06:39.623 --> 01:06:43.294
No, you didn't fuck her
in my car. Did you?

01:06:43.586 --> 01:06:44.545
No.

01:06:47.464 --> 01:06:49.633
Are we picking up Joe-Joe?

01:06:49.842 --> 01:06:53.220
He's fine. Take me home.
We gonna finish this.

01:06:53.429 --> 01:06:55.472
Jody, I know you love me.

01:06:55.806 --> 01:07:00.311
I also know you fuck other girls.
I don't like it, but I know you.

01:07:00.644 --> 01:07:02.479
So just be real with me.

01:07:03.314 --> 01:07:04.982
Will you be honest?

01:07:05.274 --> 01:07:09.403
If you can take it.
You're starting to get on my nerves.

01:07:09.653 --> 01:07:14.325
I'm getting on your nerves?
You're the one fucking around.

01:07:14.658 --> 01:07:17.828
You get with any of them
clients of yours?

01:07:18.162 --> 01:07:19.496
A few.

01:07:19.830 --> 01:07:22.583
Feel better now? I love you, girl.

01:07:23.167 --> 01:07:26.337
You got my son and
you'll probably be my wife.

01:07:26.837 --> 01:07:29.340
- You want me to be honest?
- Yeah, I do.

01:07:31.300 --> 01:07:33.928
You're my woman.
Them other hos is tricks.

01:07:34.178 --> 01:07:38.933
I want to be with you,
but I fuck other girls occasionally.

01:07:39.183 --> 01:07:42.186
I don't know why, I just do.
That's it.

01:07:42.519 --> 01:07:47.358
You feel better now? There's
honesty for you. Deal with it.

01:07:47.650 --> 01:07:49.443
I love you enough to be honest.

01:07:49.693 --> 01:07:53.864
If you loved me, you wouldn't
lie to me all the time.

01:07:54.198 --> 01:07:55.366
Move!

01:07:55.866 --> 01:07:58.869
Hold on. You got it all twisted up!

01:07:59.203 --> 01:08:03.707
I lie 'cause I love you. Being
honest means I don't give a fuck.

01:08:04.041 --> 01:08:09.046
Out on the street, I tell the hos the
truth. I lie to you because I care.

01:08:09.546 --> 01:08:12.508
It's obvious
you can't handle the truth.

01:08:12.716 --> 01:08:14.051
You fuck Pandora?

01:08:14.343 --> 01:08:16.303
Why... Come on, Yvette.

01:08:18.555 --> 01:08:22.893
Open the door. If this food gets cold,
I'm gonna be mad.

01:08:23.227 --> 01:08:27.398
Since you're being honest,
just be real. Did you?

01:08:29.024 --> 01:08:31.193
If you want me to, yes, I did.

01:08:31.402 --> 01:08:36.740
What do you mean, if I want you to?
No, I don't want you to! Did you?

01:08:40.077 --> 01:08:42.912
Oh, my God. You did.

01:08:44.581 --> 01:08:47.876
- Why, Jody?
- I didn't. I was playing with you.

01:08:48.085 --> 01:08:51.212
- Not with that bitch!
- I fucked others. Not her.

01:08:51.421 --> 01:08:55.926
- With someone at my job?
- No. I wouldn't do that to you.

01:08:56.135 --> 01:08:59.596
That's breaking the code.
I wouldn't do that.

01:08:59.805 --> 01:09:03.642
- Staring at me and shit...
- Why you so fired up?

01:09:04.393 --> 01:09:08.814
You gave those bitches at my job
a reason to laugh at me!

01:09:09.023 --> 01:09:11.899
Calm down before I come slap you.

01:09:12.151 --> 01:09:13.652
You ain't doing shit!

01:09:13.861 --> 01:09:16.904
Why you insecure?
Nobody's laughing at you.

01:09:17.113 --> 01:09:21.285
They're probably jealous
you got a man who loves you.

01:09:21.493 --> 01:09:24.287
Don't be so insecure.
I can't stand it.

01:09:24.496 --> 01:09:28.125
If I'm insecure, it's because
you made me this way!

01:09:28.334 --> 01:09:30.669
All you think about is yourself!

01:09:31.002 --> 01:09:35.341
Out of all people, why'd you have
to fuck that girl? Damn!

01:09:35.674 --> 01:09:38.676
- I told you I didn't!
- You're a liar!

01:09:39.011 --> 01:09:42.139
- I'm out of here.
- You ain't leaving.

01:09:42.348 --> 01:09:46.310
- Get out of the way.
- Stay here! I'm sick of your shit!

01:09:46.518 --> 01:09:50.064
Don't put your hands on me!
Are you fucking crazy?

01:09:50.272 --> 01:09:51.523
Shut up!

01:09:52.858 --> 01:09:54.526
Are you crazy?

01:09:54.860 --> 01:09:58.030
I'm sick of your cheating on me, Jody!

01:09:58.364 --> 01:10:01.367
You make me sick! You're full of shit!

01:10:02.618 --> 01:10:05.079
I told you to stop hitting me!

01:10:08.207 --> 01:10:09.541
Oh, shit, Yvette.

01:10:10.376 --> 01:10:12.711
Come on. Get up, baby.

01:10:13.045 --> 01:10:15.381
Get the fuck off of me, Jody!

01:10:15.714 --> 01:10:17.383
Baby, I'm sorry.

01:10:19.385 --> 01:10:21.387
You hit me!

01:10:26.392 --> 01:10:30.062
Yvette, come on. Get up. Get up, baby.

01:10:31.230 --> 01:10:34.066
- Get your hands off me!
- Stop it.

01:10:38.237 --> 01:10:39.571
I love you, girl.

01:10:40.906 --> 01:10:43.075
Get off me, Jody!

01:10:55.588 --> 01:10:59.425
You lied, Jody.
You said you'd never hit me.

01:10:59.758 --> 01:11:01.093
I'm sorry.

01:11:01.594 --> 01:11:03.762
You lied...

01:11:04.597 --> 01:11:07.099
I hate you, Jody.

01:11:12.938 --> 01:11:14.940
Why are you doing this?

01:11:15.441 --> 01:11:17.943
Baby, why are you doing this?

01:11:28.120 --> 01:11:30.456
Why are you doing this?

01:11:40.966 --> 01:11:42.635
I promised.

01:11:44.303 --> 01:11:45.638
It was my fault.

01:11:46.931 --> 01:11:48.599
I'll make it up to you.

01:12:06.283 --> 01:12:08.035
I'll make you feel good.

01:12:19.672 --> 01:12:20.673
Jody!

01:12:36.689 --> 01:12:38.524
I'm sorry, baby.

01:12:42.027 --> 01:12:43.362
I'm sorry.

01:12:57.209 --> 01:12:58.544
Who are you?

01:12:58.877 --> 01:13:01.880
I'm Popeye the sailor man!

01:13:02.631 --> 01:13:04.758
- Who are you?
- Who am I?

01:13:04.967 --> 01:13:07.469
- Who am I?
- That's what I said.

01:13:07.720 --> 01:13:10.556
Popeye, you ain't gonna do nothing.

01:13:21.400 --> 01:13:23.068
Son of a bitch!

01:13:24.903 --> 01:13:27.072
Someone stole my damn car!

01:13:27.406 --> 01:13:29.742
Son of a bitch. Mama!

01:13:31.452 --> 01:13:33.787
Yvette. Hi, baby.

01:13:35.122 --> 01:13:39.960
Baby, don't be mad at me.
It ain't my fault. I love you.

01:13:40.669 --> 01:13:42.338
I'm listening.

01:13:45.174 --> 01:13:47.176
Some Mexican stole your car.

01:13:47.343 --> 01:13:48.928
What? Jody...

01:13:49.136 --> 01:13:50.095
You hear?

01:13:50.512 --> 01:13:51.764
I hear you.

01:13:52.097 --> 01:13:54.516
You got that tracking thing on?

01:13:55.351 --> 01:13:59.313
Cool. We'll find it in 30 minutes.
Call the po-pos.

01:13:59.521 --> 01:14:01.315
- I ain't doing that.
- Why?

01:14:01.523 --> 01:14:03.317
I know who stole my car.

01:14:03.567 --> 01:14:06.820
Who? Tell me
and I'll get it back for you.

01:14:07.988 --> 01:14:09.990
I stole my car, Jody.

01:14:25.005 --> 01:14:27.216
Jody, where you rolling?

01:14:37.226 --> 01:14:39.728
Y'all watch my bike, homies.

01:14:48.570 --> 01:14:50.239
Open the door, Yvette!

01:14:50.572 --> 01:14:51.573
Go away!

01:14:51.782 --> 01:14:55.911
I'm sorry I hit you, okay?
You blacked my eye too.

01:14:56.120 --> 01:14:58.414
What about me? Why are you mad?

01:14:58.747 --> 01:15:02.251
- When will you grow up?
- What? I am grown!

01:15:02.585 --> 01:15:04.587
No, for real, Jody.

01:15:05.754 --> 01:15:09.592
When will you realize
you had something really good?

01:15:10.426 --> 01:15:14.096
I take a lot of shit from you
because I love you.

01:15:15.097 --> 01:15:16.432
Baby, I understand.

01:15:17.099 --> 01:15:20.102
I understand, okay?
Please open the door.

01:15:20.269 --> 01:15:22.521
Let's discuss this inside.

01:15:22.730 --> 01:15:26.775
I won't be selfish no more.
I won't fuck other girls.

01:15:27.109 --> 01:15:30.112
I'll be good, I promise. You hear me?

01:15:32.281 --> 01:15:37.161
You don't mean it. You're just running
your mouth, like you always do.

01:15:37.369 --> 01:15:39.079
You don't mean that shit!

01:15:39.330 --> 01:15:41.749
Open this motherfucking door!

01:15:41.957 --> 01:15:44.960
- Why'd you steal my car?
- Your car?!

01:15:45.169 --> 01:15:48.631
Yeah! If not, give me back
the Daytons I put on.

01:15:48.797 --> 01:15:51.342
The tinted windows I paid for.

01:15:51.550 --> 01:15:55.095
The money I put into the engine
and the brakes!

01:15:55.304 --> 01:15:57.973
- Open this door!
- Jody, don't do this!

01:15:58.307 --> 01:15:59.308
Daddy!

01:15:59.642 --> 01:16:01.644
No, Joe-Joe. Come here.

01:16:02.061 --> 01:16:05.272
- I want to see my daddy!
- I want to see my son!

01:16:05.481 --> 01:16:07.483
I'm gonna call the police!

01:16:07.691 --> 01:16:12.112
My son wants to see me!
Why are you keeping me from my son?

01:16:12.613 --> 01:16:16.700
- Stop kicking the damn door!
- Jody, please go away.

01:16:16.909 --> 01:16:20.454
- Your neighbor's snooping!
- Go, before I get put out!

01:16:20.663 --> 01:16:25.876
- Fuck you, Yvette.
- Me? After all the shit I put up with?

01:16:26.085 --> 01:16:27.503
Fuck me?! Fuck you!

01:16:27.836 --> 01:16:31.173
All right.
You remember this shit, girl.

01:16:31.507 --> 01:16:35.344
That's fucked up.
I can't believe this shit.

01:16:35.594 --> 01:16:36.595
You okay?

01:17:02.538 --> 01:17:04.707
Hey, Jody. Come here.

01:17:05.040 --> 01:17:08.377
Come dance with me.
What's that thing y'all do?

01:17:08.711 --> 01:17:11.213
The C-walk? I got it. Look.

01:17:11.880 --> 01:17:15.050
That's it. Look, Jody.
Come on, Jody!

01:17:30.065 --> 01:17:34.403
She don't understand
how much I love her ass, Mama.

01:17:34.737 --> 01:17:38.907
I mean, I cheat.
I do what I do, but I'm good.

01:17:39.241 --> 01:17:41.243
I'm good to her ass.

01:17:42.578 --> 01:17:47.041
I take her back and forth to work,
I fix the car when it breaks...

01:17:47.249 --> 01:17:51.086
...I give her money
for the phone bill and groceries.

01:17:51.420 --> 01:17:55.674
I even rub her feet sometime!
She say I'm selfish.

01:17:55.883 --> 01:18:01.221
Ever see it from her point of view?
What if you was Yvette and she was you?

01:18:04.934 --> 01:18:07.353
What if she fucked around on you...

01:18:07.561 --> 01:18:11.774
...took your car and left you
at home all day with a baby?

01:18:13.776 --> 01:18:16.195
- You're taking her side.
- Hold it.

01:18:16.403 --> 01:18:20.783
All I'm saying is
you may be a little selfish.

01:18:21.116 --> 01:18:22.284
Jody.

01:18:22.493 --> 01:18:26.956
Look at me. You have got
to think of her as a woman.

01:18:27.122 --> 01:18:31.585
What if someone did all the shit
you do to Yvette to me?

01:18:33.295 --> 01:18:37.091
Your daddy used to do
the same shit you're doing now.

01:18:37.299 --> 01:18:39.468
I just know how Yvette feels.

01:18:41.637 --> 01:18:44.640
Yvette loves you. She just feels hurt.

01:18:44.807 --> 01:18:48.018
A woman gets tired of a man
after a while...

01:18:48.227 --> 01:18:50.938
...if she feels used
and unappreciated.

01:18:51.814 --> 01:18:55.276
Believe me, as much as you're
thinking about Yvette...

01:18:55.651 --> 01:18:57.736
...she's thinking about you too.

01:18:57.945 --> 01:19:01.991
Stop telling girls you want
a baby while you're doing it.

01:19:02.199 --> 01:19:04.201
They believe your lying ass.

01:19:04.410 --> 01:19:07.955
I fell for the same shit
when I was their age.

01:19:08.163 --> 01:19:09.331
Yvette.

01:19:57.379 --> 01:19:59.673
You know you love this shit.

01:19:59.882 --> 01:20:01.634
No, you love this shit.

01:20:01.842 --> 01:20:05.012
You bet I do.
I love that big ass, girl.

01:20:05.220 --> 01:20:06.889
Yeah. For sure.

01:20:08.557 --> 01:20:09.975
Please believe that.

01:20:10.184 --> 01:20:11.143
Hey, girl.

01:20:11.393 --> 01:20:13.020
What you doing?

01:20:13.228 --> 01:20:17.399
Are you on the damn phone again?
Get off the phone.

01:20:17.733 --> 01:20:20.027
What's that noise? You okay?

01:20:20.235 --> 01:20:24.823
That's Chris. Nigga is trippin'.
We've been drinking thug passion.

01:20:25.032 --> 01:20:28.661
Get off the phone! Bumping your gums,
talking to hos.

01:20:28.869 --> 01:20:32.414
You made up with that nigga Jody yet?

01:20:32.706 --> 01:20:34.875
I ain't thinking about him.

01:20:35.084 --> 01:20:38.504
Yeah, right.
Jody know that's his pussy.

01:20:38.712 --> 01:20:42.383
- I won't put up with it no more.
- Am I invisible?

01:20:42.591 --> 01:20:43.717
I feel you.

01:20:43.926 --> 01:20:48.222
- Hello! Lights on. Anyone home?
- I definitely feel you.

01:20:48.430 --> 01:20:53.769
Hang up and come here so I can
drop it in your drawers. Damn!

01:20:53.978 --> 01:20:59.233
These niggas trip when they think
they own you. You need to check him.

01:20:59.441 --> 01:21:01.443
You need to check these nuts.

01:21:01.610 --> 01:21:05.531
Shut the fuck up!
You see I'm on the damn phone!

01:21:05.739 --> 01:21:08.993
- Shut your motherfucking ass!
- Fuck them hos!

01:21:09.201 --> 01:21:14.248
Always talking to them bitches about
they niggas. Attend to your nigga.

01:21:14.790 --> 01:21:19.253
Jody crossed my last nerve.
I can't put up with it no more.

01:21:19.461 --> 01:21:22.423
- You know what I'm saying?
- I know.

01:21:22.840 --> 01:21:25.259
Who the fuck are you talking to?

01:21:26.802 --> 01:21:27.928
Who is that?

01:21:28.137 --> 01:21:30.598
I thought about
getting back together...

01:21:30.806 --> 01:21:35.102
...but I gots to teach him a lesson,
know what I mean?

01:21:35.894 --> 01:21:39.815
Girl, I ain't gonna lie.
I miss his ass like shit.

01:21:41.817 --> 01:21:43.819
I love him to death...

01:21:45.154 --> 01:21:49.783
...but I can't have nobody act like
they own me, even my baby's daddy.

01:21:49.992 --> 01:21:51.243
You feel me, girl?

01:21:51.452 --> 01:21:53.287
I feel you. I feel you.

01:21:53.495 --> 01:21:54.705
I gotta go.

01:22:10.679 --> 01:22:14.516
Jody. I knew that nigga
would get his shit together.

01:22:15.851 --> 01:22:17.227
Oh, shit.

01:22:17.436 --> 01:22:20.064
What's happening, baby? I'm home.

01:22:21.357 --> 01:22:26.070
What you got to eat in this
motherfucker? I'm hungry as fuck.

01:22:28.030 --> 01:22:33.202
You know how I get down.
One Alizé a day. $15.15 exactly.

01:22:39.875 --> 01:22:44.546
A cup? You think I'm gonna
drink in front of the store?

01:22:45.756 --> 01:22:49.176
Throw your ass off
my motherfucking bike, nigga!

01:22:52.054 --> 01:22:55.557
What up, cuz?
This all the Alizé you got?

01:22:55.766 --> 01:22:57.226
We got Alizé.

01:22:57.393 --> 01:22:59.687
You niggas don't want to see me.

01:22:59.895 --> 01:23:01.313
I'm Looney Toon.

01:23:01.522 --> 01:23:04.984
- You know who you fucking with?
- So? Do something!

01:23:17.746 --> 01:23:20.582
Nobody want your punk-ass bike, cuz.

01:23:30.050 --> 01:23:32.261
Pea! Pea!

01:23:35.389 --> 01:23:38.100
Pea, get out here! What happened?

01:23:38.434 --> 01:23:41.770
- Shit! Nigga, what happened?
- I got jumped.

01:23:42.104 --> 01:23:44.607
- By who?
- Some little niggas.

01:23:44.857 --> 01:23:47.234
By little niggas?! Get my gun!

01:23:47.443 --> 01:23:49.236
Is that the niggas there?

01:23:50.279 --> 01:23:53.198
Yeah, that's them. That's them, Pea.

01:23:54.116 --> 01:23:56.619
I got something for their ass.

01:23:56.785 --> 01:23:58.203
Pull up over here.

01:23:58.412 --> 01:24:00.247
She just started Dorsey.

01:24:00.456 --> 01:24:03.459
- She 14?
- That bitch look like she 21.

01:24:03.626 --> 01:24:07.254
The one with the hat's
the one who took my Alizé.

01:24:10.966 --> 01:24:14.762
Y'all talking about these hos.
Let's go get some.

01:24:14.970 --> 01:24:19.642
Hold up, nigga.
Nigga, watch that shit, man.

01:24:20.142 --> 01:24:24.647
It's your size. What the fuck
are you doing, nigga?

01:24:24.980 --> 01:24:28.984
Shit, nigga! Your ass stinks!
Leave us alone.

01:24:29.485 --> 01:24:31.987
Get on the ground, motherfuckers!

01:24:32.279 --> 01:24:33.739
No, Pea!

01:24:34.323 --> 01:24:35.658
Get on the ground.

01:24:35.950 --> 01:24:39.954
How you doing, homie?
You ain't so hard now, huh?

01:24:40.162 --> 01:24:44.458
What up, nigga?
What you got in your pockets?

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:46.335
Say something.

01:24:49.505 --> 01:24:52.633
You stinky-ass nigga.
Take a bath, homie.

01:24:54.134 --> 01:24:57.346
These broke-ass niggas
ain't got no money.

01:24:57.554 --> 01:24:59.556
Fuck that shit. Stand up.

01:24:59.765 --> 01:25:02.935
Teach you to respect elders
before you die.

01:25:07.147 --> 01:25:10.109
Looney Toon, huh? Bark.

01:25:11.735 --> 01:25:13.696
Punk-ass nigga.

01:25:14.154 --> 01:25:16.198
You tried to take my liquor!

01:25:20.369 --> 01:25:22.997
And you tried to take my bike.

01:25:24.581 --> 01:25:29.545
What kind of bitch-ass punch was that?
I thought I taught you better.

01:25:29.712 --> 01:25:31.839
I hit the nigga in the teeth.

01:25:32.047 --> 01:25:35.676
Are you saying his teeth
are harder than your fist?

01:25:35.884 --> 01:25:39.763
Let me show you. You gotta learn
the one-hitter quitter.

01:25:40.889 --> 01:25:42.725
No, Pea. Not him.

01:25:42.933 --> 01:25:47.313
Hit Mr. Alizé there.
He took my liquor. Do him first.

01:25:47.563 --> 01:25:50.899
You got to get up close.
You kind of draw back.

01:25:51.108 --> 01:25:55.195
Not too far, though.
Aim for the nose or mouth.

01:25:55.404 --> 01:25:58.907
- Prefally the nose. It's soft.
- "Prefally," huh?

01:25:59.116 --> 01:26:01.243
Nigga, you know what I mean.

01:26:03.912 --> 01:26:06.915
It's over then. You try again, nigga.

01:26:07.374 --> 01:26:11.045
- Get your ass up, bike man.
- Come on, cuz. My jaw hurt.

01:26:11.253 --> 01:26:15.883
Nobody got sympathy for you or your
homies. Trying to jump somebody.

01:26:16.091 --> 01:26:20.512
Get your bitch ass up right now
before I bust your head open!

01:26:23.599 --> 01:26:26.101
Don't flinch, nigga. Stand still.

01:26:27.603 --> 01:26:29.605
I said, don't flinch.

01:26:30.940 --> 01:26:32.775
That's it, baby boy.

01:26:38.155 --> 01:26:41.742
Don't flinch. Don't move
or I'll hit you with two.

01:26:41.951 --> 01:26:45.245
Chuck that shit up.
Chuck it up, little nigga.

01:26:48.457 --> 01:26:50.960
Oh, shit. This nigga got heart.

01:26:52.127 --> 01:26:54.964
Look at this nigga. You got heart?

01:26:55.631 --> 01:26:58.968
You got heart, cuz?
Go ahead and tell us.

01:27:03.681 --> 01:27:06.934
Don't fuck with him.
He got heart. Let him go.

01:27:07.142 --> 01:27:09.270
Yeah, I won't hit him.

01:27:09.478 --> 01:27:13.232
I won't sock you, 'cause you
got heart. I respect that.

01:27:13.440 --> 01:27:16.527
You ain't no punk-ass mark
like the rest of your homeboys.

01:27:16.735 --> 01:27:20.739
- Let him go.
- I won't hit him. I'll whip your ass.

01:27:20.948 --> 01:27:22.783
I'm gonna whip your ass!

01:27:25.494 --> 01:27:28.664
- Who's your daddy?
- You're my daddy.

01:27:28.872 --> 01:27:32.626
Louder, nigga! I'm gonna beat
your motherfucking ass!

01:27:32.835 --> 01:27:35.671
Fuck you, jumping punk! Get up!

01:27:36.171 --> 01:27:40.175
I'm not done with you.
You need a whuppin', motherfucker.

01:27:40.384 --> 01:27:43.637
Respect your
motherfucking elders, punk!

01:27:43.846 --> 01:27:46.640
This stupid motherfucker's crazy!

01:27:46.849 --> 01:27:48.684
Be off this bitch, cuz.

01:27:56.775 --> 01:27:59.695
What part of "couch"
don't you understand?

01:27:59.903 --> 01:28:02.656
I'm fresh out.
Ain't you happy to see me?

01:28:02.865 --> 01:28:07.161
No. I didn't tell you to come here.
You invited yourself.

01:28:08.370 --> 01:28:12.958
When my parole officer saw your
letters, he approved my stay here.

01:28:13.167 --> 01:28:17.796
I wrote you twice, just to be nice.
I wasn't thinking about you.

01:28:18.005 --> 01:28:22.009
You wasn't? Why'd you accept
all them calls then?

01:28:22.217 --> 01:28:24.720
I must've been in your head.

01:28:24.887 --> 01:28:26.513
I'm your first.

01:28:26.722 --> 01:28:30.684
Your first, your last
and you're my only.

01:28:30.893 --> 01:28:35.356
- Quit playing and give me some love.
- Get the fuck out of my room.

01:28:35.564 --> 01:28:38.692
I ain't going there.
And don't wake my baby.

01:28:38.901 --> 01:28:42.696
You can have a baby with Jody,
but you won't fuck me?

01:28:42.905 --> 01:28:47.576
You better get to the couch
before I call your parole officer.

01:28:48.410 --> 01:28:50.913
- Oh, like that?
- Yeah, like that.

01:28:52.206 --> 01:28:53.999
Give me an extra blanket.

01:28:54.208 --> 01:28:58.003
Get it out of the closet.
And close my door.

01:29:41.380 --> 01:29:42.881
Who are you, loc?

01:29:45.134 --> 01:29:46.552
Where's Yvette?

01:29:50.139 --> 01:29:51.265
Jody?

01:29:51.640 --> 01:29:53.100
Nigga, are you Jody?

01:29:53.475 --> 01:29:55.436
Yvette ain't here.

01:29:55.811 --> 01:29:57.938
You come to get your little son?

01:29:58.314 --> 01:30:01.942
Come get his ass.
I ain't trying to be his father.

01:30:02.985 --> 01:30:04.612
Joe-Joe, come here.

01:30:08.824 --> 01:30:10.117
You okay?

01:30:11.327 --> 01:30:13.287
Go downstairs. Hurry up.

01:30:17.416 --> 01:30:21.879
I can't believe he had the audacity
to come to my house...

01:30:22.087 --> 01:30:25.215
...after he talk shit to me
when I was locked up...

01:30:25.424 --> 01:30:30.137
...fucked my bitch and had a baby
by her! Go get the heat. Fuck this!

01:30:34.725 --> 01:30:37.394
- Hey, nigga.
- He's riding a bike?

01:30:37.603 --> 01:30:40.105
You sound real hard on the phone.

01:30:42.274 --> 01:30:46.236
- Y'all got to get that nigga, cuz.
- That nigga's a moron.

01:30:46.445 --> 01:30:49.448
- I'll get that fool.
- Full speed ahead.

01:31:02.044 --> 01:31:03.504
Come on, little man.

01:31:10.344 --> 01:31:12.638
You're getting heavy. You hungry?

01:31:34.743 --> 01:31:39.415
You know about that music, youngster?
That's grown folks' music.

01:31:42.459 --> 01:31:46.922
Oh, that's Marvin!
What's he say, baby?

01:31:50.092 --> 01:31:53.929
Jody. Marvin? Please believe me.

01:32:21.624 --> 01:32:24.460
- Them niggas still at your house?
- No.

01:32:25.628 --> 01:32:27.296
Wait right here.

01:32:34.970 --> 01:32:39.224
I didn't ask Rodney to come.
He just showed up.

01:32:39.433 --> 01:32:41.435
Now he won't leave.

01:32:42.311 --> 01:32:46.815
You wanted a man at the house.
I guess you happy now.

01:32:47.066 --> 01:32:49.568
I didn't ask him to come, Jody.

01:32:51.236 --> 01:32:54.615
I'm not fucking him,
if you're thinking that.

01:32:57.576 --> 01:33:00.663
The car broke
and the engine needs fixing.

01:33:01.330 --> 01:33:02.831
Ain't my problem.

01:33:04.833 --> 01:33:07.586
- Get the fuck off my doorstep.
- Wait!

01:33:40.286 --> 01:33:42.496
He don't love me no more.

01:33:48.127 --> 01:33:50.796
He don't love me no more.

01:33:54.466 --> 01:33:58.220
Oh, my God.
He don't love me no more.

01:33:59.805 --> 01:34:02.057
Get me out of here!

01:34:18.490 --> 01:34:21.118
- Peanut, what you doing?
- Nothing.

01:34:21.327 --> 01:34:22.828
You miss me?

01:34:23.662 --> 01:34:25.331
You love me?

01:34:25.998 --> 01:34:28.042
You hear me? You love me?

01:34:28.250 --> 01:34:30.294
What do you want? I'm busy.

01:34:30.502 --> 01:34:34.381
You ain't doing shit.
Get me so I can give you a sample.

01:34:34.590 --> 01:34:37.593
What? I ain't coming to get your ass!

01:34:37.801 --> 01:34:42.389
- Where's your other baby mama's ride?
- Why you doing all that?

01:34:42.598 --> 01:34:46.393
Tell you what. When I want
some dick, I'll call you...

01:34:46.602 --> 01:34:49.438
...and you can find a way to get here.

01:35:07.039 --> 01:35:08.999
Is this what I think it is?

01:35:09.208 --> 01:35:10.209
Jody!

01:35:10.542 --> 01:35:12.711
Jody! What is this?

01:35:14.838 --> 01:35:15.839
Cannabis.

01:35:16.048 --> 01:35:21.011
It was in my tomato plants! I show
you something new, and you do this?

01:35:21.220 --> 01:35:23.430
Plant this shit in my garden?

01:35:23.639 --> 01:35:26.433
- Are you saying I planted this?
- Who else?

01:35:26.642 --> 01:35:30.187
I didn't. You need to check
your boyfriend, Melvin.

01:35:30.396 --> 01:35:32.940
You're blaming me for his bullshit.

01:35:33.148 --> 01:35:38.028
You know you did it!
Melvin wouldn't do no shit like this.

01:35:38.237 --> 01:35:43.242
You trust him before me? Why would I
put weed in my mama's garden?

01:35:43.492 --> 01:35:46.620
- Shut up!
- What kind of fool do you think I am?

01:35:46.829 --> 01:35:48.455
Where's Melvin? Ask him!

01:35:48.664 --> 01:35:51.584
- He's a bitch-ass nigga.
- Shut up, Jody.

01:35:52.918 --> 01:35:54.920
Watch. I'll show you.

01:35:57.923 --> 01:36:00.968
Tell him. Tell him, Mama.

01:36:02.094 --> 01:36:03.262
Tell me what?

01:36:03.512 --> 01:36:06.181
She found the weed you planted.

01:36:06.432 --> 01:36:11.061
Tell her about it so she can
get off my case. You did it, huh?

01:36:11.270 --> 01:36:12.438
Melvin...

01:36:13.105 --> 01:36:15.107
- Yeah.
- Kick him out, Mama.

01:36:15.357 --> 01:36:19.069
- Mel! What were you thinking about?
- Getting blazed.

01:36:19.278 --> 01:36:21.280
I'm not understanding.

01:36:21.530 --> 01:36:24.199
I made a mistake. I'm sorry.

01:36:24.950 --> 01:36:26.619
It won't happen again.

01:36:37.630 --> 01:36:39.548
Ain't that a bitch.

01:36:41.967 --> 01:36:46.639
Oh, so it's cool now? When it was
on me, it was World War Ill.

01:36:46.972 --> 01:36:50.768
But since Mr. Melvin 'fessed up
to it, it's all good?

01:36:51.310 --> 01:36:54.855
See how you is, Mama?
I would never do that shit.

01:36:55.064 --> 01:36:58.359
I don't want to go back to jail,
or put you there.

01:36:58.567 --> 01:37:01.195
But I don't get no credit for that.

01:37:01.403 --> 01:37:03.781
- Shut up.
- Can't stand the truth?

01:37:03.989 --> 01:37:05.199
Shut up!

01:37:05.407 --> 01:37:09.745
How you think I feel, you laid up
with this thug-ass nigga...

01:37:09.954 --> 01:37:13.999
...you don't even know,
who wants to kick me out.

01:37:14.291 --> 01:37:17.127
I can take care of myself!

01:37:17.795 --> 01:37:20.965
You don't need to check
the folks I deal with.

01:37:21.173 --> 01:37:25.427
Am I in your business with all the
hookers you run with? No.

01:37:25.636 --> 01:37:28.055
So I need the same respect!

01:37:28.264 --> 01:37:32.893
You are getting on my last nerve
with this shit about Melvin!

01:37:33.143 --> 01:37:34.687
This is my house too!

01:37:35.729 --> 01:37:36.689
Your house?

01:37:37.690 --> 01:37:38.691
Your house?

01:37:39.149 --> 01:37:43.946
Do you pay any bills in this
motherfucker? Do you fix anything?

01:37:44.154 --> 01:37:49.159
When's the last time you paid a bill?
All you do is eat, sleep and shit!

01:37:49.702 --> 01:37:52.579
Walking around here
like you're King Tut!

01:37:52.955 --> 01:37:56.667
Don't give me mess about
whose house this is. It's mine!

01:37:56.959 --> 01:37:59.169
If I want to bring a man in...

01:37:59.503 --> 01:38:03.841
...I'll bring a man in!
That's my say, not yours!

01:38:06.677 --> 01:38:10.306
- What the fuck you laughing at?
- Your spoiled ass.

01:38:10.514 --> 01:38:14.685
Melvin, honey.
Don't start anything, please.

01:38:15.185 --> 01:38:17.479
No, 'Nita. He need to hear this.

01:38:17.688 --> 01:38:21.483
I keep quiet out of love
and respect for your mama...

01:38:21.692 --> 01:38:24.987
...but you need to be a man.
- Be a man?

01:38:25.195 --> 01:38:29.325
What do you mean? Like you?
I should be like you, Melvin?

01:38:29.533 --> 01:38:33.621
You could never be like me.
You don't need to be.

01:38:33.829 --> 01:38:37.458
What you need to do
is to stop blaming everyone...

01:38:37.666 --> 01:38:40.044
...for your problems. Check yourself.

01:38:40.252 --> 01:38:44.757
You know what your problem is,
baby boy? You got shit twisted.

01:38:44.965 --> 01:38:48.802
You got an Oedipus complex.
Your mama ain't your woman.

01:38:49.011 --> 01:38:52.014
But this is my woman. My woman.

01:38:52.222 --> 01:38:55.225
All right, that's enough. Come on.

01:38:57.061 --> 01:39:00.606
Forget this shit.
I got heat for niggas like you.

01:39:00.814 --> 01:39:04.318
- Jody, that's enough.
- Nigga, you need to move!

01:39:06.904 --> 01:39:10.199
What, motherfucker?
I said not to fuck with me!

01:39:10.407 --> 01:39:13.410
Stop it! Melvin, stop! Melvin!

01:39:13.744 --> 01:39:17.748
No, Melvin, stop it!
Stop it! Break it up!

01:39:18.082 --> 01:39:19.249
Are you crazy?!

01:39:19.458 --> 01:39:23.754
I told him not to fuck with me!
But you want to fuck with me?

01:39:23.963 --> 01:39:28.550
I try to be a good nigga, but I can't
because bitch-ass niggas...

01:39:28.759 --> 01:39:31.428
...like you want to fuck with me!

01:39:31.637 --> 01:39:35.849
You want a nigga with two strikes
to go to jail for life!

01:39:36.058 --> 01:39:37.101
I'm leaving.

01:39:37.393 --> 01:39:40.396
No! I'm leaving.
I can't live like this.

01:39:40.604 --> 01:39:45.359
- That's right! You leave this house!
- You deal with your son!

01:39:45.567 --> 01:39:47.444
- Or I'll kill him!
- Don't go.

01:39:47.736 --> 01:39:51.282
- Deal with him before I kill him!
- "Don't go"?!

01:39:51.949 --> 01:39:54.451
You're choosing this nigga over me?!

01:39:54.952 --> 01:39:57.788
Your flesh and blood? Your child?

01:39:58.122 --> 01:40:02.126
You are not a baby anymore!
You are not a child!

01:40:08.132 --> 01:40:11.135
Wants to fuck with me,
I'll kill him!

01:40:11.468 --> 01:40:13.304
Wait! Calm down!

01:40:29.987 --> 01:40:31.655
If I get killed...

01:40:32.156 --> 01:40:33.824
...it's on you, Mama.

01:40:35.159 --> 01:40:37.494
You got your own life.

01:40:38.329 --> 01:40:39.496
Yeah.

01:40:40.998 --> 01:40:43.000
Mama got a life too.

01:40:45.836 --> 01:40:47.504
I know now.

01:40:50.966 --> 01:40:54.178
Don't call me
when he starts beating you.

01:40:59.350 --> 01:41:00.768
I'm sorry.

01:41:03.020 --> 01:41:04.688
I fucked up.

01:41:13.030 --> 01:41:16.200
Nigga, who told you
to light my candles?

01:41:16.533 --> 01:41:18.494
I'm trying to set a mode.

01:41:18.702 --> 01:41:22.498
Ain't no "mode," and get your feet
off my table. You moded.

01:41:22.706 --> 01:41:26.710
Ow, nigga! You will never
taste this again, ever!

01:41:27.044 --> 01:41:31.715
- Hush with that. You know you love me.
- That's why you out there.

01:41:32.549 --> 01:41:34.677
Quit bullshitting yourself.

01:41:34.885 --> 01:41:38.722
You quit. Better use your hand!
Towel's in the closet.

01:41:39.056 --> 01:41:41.725
Do what you know, jailbird.
Good night.

01:42:24.435 --> 01:42:25.769
Hold me.

01:42:30.774 --> 01:42:32.359
Hold me tight.

01:42:44.121 --> 01:42:45.789
Rodney, wake up!

01:42:47.124 --> 01:42:48.959
Goddamn!

01:42:49.960 --> 01:42:54.965
Rodney, you have to find somewhere
to live. You can't stay here no more.

01:42:55.424 --> 01:42:58.302
You know I ain't got
nowhere else to stay.

01:42:58.636 --> 01:43:01.472
I don't care where you go, just go!

01:43:01.764 --> 01:43:05.601
Get your monkey ass out!
My house smell like stale feet!

01:43:05.809 --> 01:43:07.144
Get out!

01:43:08.979 --> 01:43:10.981
Good morning, scrub.

01:43:12.483 --> 01:43:14.652
Built you a little fort, huh?

01:43:17.488 --> 01:43:21.492
- I don't give a fuck about your fort.
- I hate you.

01:43:22.326 --> 01:43:25.496
I hate you too, li'I nigga.
You ain't my son.

01:43:37.508 --> 01:43:38.676
Shit.

01:43:43.847 --> 01:43:46.183
- Come here, Yvette.
- Get off me.

01:43:46.517 --> 01:43:50.521
- We need some order around here.
- Get your hands off me!

01:43:50.813 --> 01:43:53.107
First, we need to get married.

01:43:54.316 --> 01:43:59.113
- Then you'll have my baby.
- I ain't having no baby by you!

01:43:59.363 --> 01:44:03.200
Why not? You got a baby
by that punk-ass nigga Jody!

01:44:03.701 --> 01:44:07.788
- Two days and you ain't gave me any.
- That ain't my problem!

01:44:08.038 --> 01:44:10.708
- Get off of me!
- You know you love me.

01:44:11.041 --> 01:44:13.544
Get out of my room!

01:44:13.836 --> 01:44:17.965
Get your ass back over here!
I'm sick of playing games.

01:44:18.382 --> 01:44:23.053
Sit your ass down. I'll break your
fucking face if you get up again.

01:44:23.262 --> 01:44:26.807
You're gonna give me some.
Turn over. I'm horny.

01:44:27.558 --> 01:44:28.976
Don't hit my mommy!

01:44:29.226 --> 01:44:31.395
Shut up! Go watch cartoons.

01:44:31.729 --> 01:44:34.732
- Joe-Joe, go to your room, baby.
- Open up.

01:44:35.649 --> 01:44:39.236
- You're gonna have my baby.
- Leave my mommy alone!

01:44:39.570 --> 01:44:41.071
Stop it!

01:44:42.573 --> 01:44:46.243
You're gonna rape me?
In front of my son?

01:44:46.869 --> 01:44:47.828
Stop!

01:44:49.413 --> 01:44:51.582
Stop it! Get off my mommy!

01:44:52.249 --> 01:44:53.918
Get off me.

01:44:58.923 --> 01:45:01.091
- I want my daddy.
- I know.

01:45:01.425 --> 01:45:04.428
- Fuck your punk-ass daddy!
- I do too.

01:45:05.763 --> 01:45:08.265
Fish and bread keep a poor man fed.

01:45:09.099 --> 01:45:11.101
Add 'em up, bro.

01:45:11.435 --> 01:45:14.772
I'll get you something to fight with.

01:45:19.610 --> 01:45:22.112
It didn't take you that long
to sit down.

01:45:26.283 --> 01:45:29.453
He see you. He's just trying to front.

01:45:30.287 --> 01:45:31.538
Thanks, Kim.

01:45:34.458 --> 01:45:35.960
What's up, Pea?

01:45:38.254 --> 01:45:39.797
Strike 'em up.

01:45:56.981 --> 01:45:58.649
Where you at, Pea?

01:45:59.483 --> 01:46:01.151
Come on, add them up.

01:46:02.820 --> 01:46:04.822
Where you going, Yvette?

01:46:07.324 --> 01:46:11.453
Why you acting all man?
It's like you don't miss me.

01:46:11.662 --> 01:46:15.457
You don't know what I've been
through the last two days.

01:46:17.334 --> 01:46:20.963
Rodney tried to rape me
in front of Joe-Joe.

01:46:21.171 --> 01:46:24.925
He was screaming, "Daddy!"
and I was there alone.

01:46:27.845 --> 01:46:29.847
Baby, I'm here.

01:46:31.181 --> 01:46:34.018
I miss you. I miss your ass so much.

01:46:34.852 --> 01:46:38.856
I love you. You're my rib.
You heard of Adam's rib?

01:46:41.025 --> 01:46:43.193
That's how God made Eve.

01:46:48.532 --> 01:46:50.534
I'm gonna get my stuff.

01:46:51.327 --> 01:46:52.286
Damn.

01:47:51.428 --> 01:47:53.430
I can't do this.

01:47:53.931 --> 01:47:55.766
How you gonna get him out?

01:47:56.100 --> 01:47:57.601
I don't know.

01:47:57.935 --> 01:48:01.272
But if we whip his ass,
he'll come back with his homies...

01:48:01.605 --> 01:48:03.941
...and shoot me, my girl and my baby.

01:48:05.442 --> 01:48:10.447
I ain't trying to be no killer.
I can't have that on my heart, Pea.

01:48:11.782 --> 01:48:13.617
I feel you.

01:48:14.159 --> 01:48:16.662
If you don't want to, I'm with you.

01:48:16.912 --> 01:48:20.416
But if you do want to take
this fool out, I'm here too.

01:48:21.959 --> 01:48:23.460
Let's pray on it.

01:48:25.796 --> 01:48:30.467
Dear Lord, please forgive us for
the sins we have brought upon us...

01:48:30.801 --> 01:48:35.306
...and show us forgiveness
for all our sins in the future.

01:48:36.974 --> 01:48:41.812
I know you understand that niggas
ain't perfect, but we try, Lord.

01:48:42.813 --> 01:48:45.816
We try to keep our heads up
in bad times.

01:48:46.817 --> 01:48:48.986
This is a bad time.

01:48:49.486 --> 01:48:51.155
Show us the way.

01:48:51.989 --> 01:48:56.994
And if you can't show us the way,
then forgive us for being lost.

01:49:11.050 --> 01:49:12.551
Jody.

01:49:13.302 --> 01:49:15.262
Motherfucking Jody.

01:49:16.138 --> 01:49:18.641
I'm sick of this
bitch-ass motherfucker.

01:49:18.849 --> 01:49:21.602
Cuz, you ready to smash on this nigga?

01:49:22.686 --> 01:49:26.273
I know where his homie stay.
Turn on Vernon.

01:49:26.690 --> 01:49:28.359
This nigga's dead.

01:49:33.530 --> 01:49:35.532
You're a lover, not a fighter.

01:49:42.539 --> 01:49:44.208
Y'all thirsty?

01:49:45.542 --> 01:49:46.710
I'm straight.

01:49:47.002 --> 01:49:49.296
Holler if you need anything.

01:49:50.714 --> 01:49:51.882
Cool?

01:49:53.884 --> 01:49:56.053
Everything's copacetic.

01:49:57.054 --> 01:50:00.641
I hope Yvette hurry up
and gets back over here.

01:50:09.733 --> 01:50:10.985
There's my girl.

01:50:29.920 --> 01:50:31.088
Yvette?

01:50:32.423 --> 01:50:34.466
You see this shit, Pea?

01:50:34.675 --> 01:50:36.093
Played too much.

01:50:39.096 --> 01:50:41.932
Yvette! Get your ass over here.

01:51:40.824 --> 01:51:43.452
- What happened to Jody?
- Go back inside!

01:51:59.969 --> 01:52:00.970
Thank God.

01:52:02.513 --> 01:52:05.683
I thought I was...
I thought I was dead.

01:52:17.027 --> 01:52:18.362
Fuck!

01:52:22.032 --> 01:52:24.034
I thought I was dead.

01:52:27.705 --> 01:52:29.039
Yvette?

01:52:30.833 --> 01:52:32.543
Where you at?

01:52:35.546 --> 01:52:38.215
What's up with the lights? Yvette?

01:52:40.676 --> 01:52:43.971
So you're just gonna turn off
the electricity?

01:53:23.260 --> 01:53:26.263
What? I'm supposed to be
scared or something?

01:53:44.949 --> 01:53:46.951
Shit! Come on!

01:53:48.077 --> 01:53:50.204
Look! Get him!

01:53:52.623 --> 01:53:53.958
Blast!

01:54:03.634 --> 01:54:04.969
Come on.

01:54:06.804 --> 01:54:09.390
Fuck! Goddamn!

01:54:18.816 --> 01:54:22.278
Finish him off, man. Do it, cuz.

01:54:23.737 --> 01:54:25.572
Shoot me, motherfucker!

01:54:25.781 --> 01:54:30.160
I done seen everything except
Christ anyway, motherfuckers!

01:54:30.452 --> 01:54:31.829
Shoot me, nigga!

01:54:46.844 --> 01:54:49.013
Come on! Come on!

01:55:00.691 --> 01:55:03.694
Fucking coward. I'm a fucking...

01:55:57.414 --> 01:55:59.750
Get the fuck back, nigga.

01:59:11.775 --> 01:59:13.861
What's cracking, Mama?

01:59:14.278 --> 01:59:16.447
- You hungry?
- No.

01:59:16.947 --> 01:59:20.200
- Where you been staying?
- I found a place.

01:59:22.620 --> 01:59:24.455
Everything's grown now, huh?

01:59:24.788 --> 01:59:27.833
I'm about to pick
some greens for tomorrow.

01:59:28.042 --> 01:59:30.711
Throw them in the sink, wash them.

01:59:31.962 --> 01:59:35.299
What do you want, Jody? Money?
I got no money...

01:59:35.633 --> 01:59:37.968
No, Mama. God!

01:59:38.302 --> 01:59:40.971
I'm cool. Gee whiz.

01:59:42.473 --> 01:59:44.141
You want some money?

01:59:44.475 --> 01:59:47.269
Yeah, I want some money!
20 years' worth.

01:59:47.478 --> 01:59:51.065
If you was one of them mutual funds,
I'd be paid.

01:59:54.151 --> 01:59:56.654
Melvin told me y'all had a talk.

02:00:00.658 --> 02:00:02.326
Yeah, we did.

02:00:04.328 --> 02:00:06.914
I'm glad you got a boyfriend.

02:00:08.666 --> 02:00:10.918
I'm glad you're happy.

02:00:11.126 --> 02:00:15.297
I just thought once you got a new
boyfriend, you'd kick me out.

02:00:15.506 --> 02:00:18.509
I'd be out in the street
and get killed like Ray-Ray.

02:00:18.842 --> 02:00:20.344
You did kick me out...

02:00:20.678 --> 02:00:24.181
...but I ain't dead yet.
I'm a rider for mine.

02:00:24.515 --> 02:00:28.686
Nobody kicked you out, Jody.
You just left the nest.

02:00:29.687 --> 02:00:34.275
And quit this talk about dying.
Nobody's gonna die no time soon.

02:00:35.859 --> 02:00:38.529
You don't know what life'll deal you.

02:00:38.821 --> 02:00:42.116
Just try to be happy
while you're here...

02:00:42.366 --> 02:00:45.661
...hope there's another place
better than this...

02:00:45.869 --> 02:00:48.539
...and hope that Jesus
lets your ass in.

02:00:48.872 --> 02:00:50.541
But while you're here...

02:00:52.543 --> 02:00:54.878
...you better watch your back.

02:00:57.214 --> 02:00:59.049
That's what I know, Mama.

02:01:02.219 --> 02:01:03.971
That's what I know.

02:01:05.180 --> 02:01:07.141
Let me get some of this wine.

02:01:08.225 --> 02:01:10.561
That's mine. Go get your own.

02:01:10.894 --> 02:01:15.899
Why? You realize I'm a grown-ass
man right about now, right?

02:01:19.069 --> 02:01:20.404
- It's cool.
- So stupid.

02:01:20.696 --> 02:01:23.157
I'll get my own. I love you.

02:01:23.407 --> 02:01:25.743
I love you. You be good.

02:01:26.076 --> 02:01:29.872
Ain't no thing, Mama.
I'm gonna do my thug thizzle.

02:01:31.749 --> 02:01:35.210
I'm gonna make some changes,
change my life.

02:01:35.419 --> 02:01:37.755
- What's cracking?
- What's up, Jody?

02:01:38.088 --> 02:01:42.426
Not much. Loving this California life.
You know.

02:01:44.762 --> 02:01:46.805
Keep my mama happy, bro.

02:01:47.348 --> 02:01:48.766
I'm on the job.

02:01:56.607 --> 02:01:58.025
Stay up, baby boy.

02:01:58.776 --> 02:01:59.944
I got you.

02:02:10.162 --> 02:02:11.872
What you know about that?

02:02:12.414 --> 02:02:14.208
That's my shit, youngster.

02:02:14.458 --> 02:02:17.294
"You know nothing about it.
It's for grown folks."

02:02:17.628 --> 02:02:20.631
I used to get a lot of pussy
off that song.

02:02:26.303 --> 02:02:28.305
Pick up a bigger jumpsuit.

02:03:30.367 --> 02:03:32.369
Why you always leave me walking?

02:03:32.703 --> 02:03:35.456
Walking will help you drop it off.

02:03:35.706 --> 02:03:38.709
Real funny. I can't wait
to drop it off.

02:03:53.182 --> 02:03:54.308
I love y'all.

02:03:54.516 --> 02:03:56.393
I'm about to spank that ass.

02:03:56.644 --> 02:04:00.648
No, I'm about to spank
that ass for life.

02:04:01.231 --> 02:04:03.067
Please believe me.

02:04:04.068 --> 02:04:05.736
On the real!

02:04:06.070 --> 02:04:08.864
- Is that what you think?
- That's what I know.

02:04:09.073 --> 02:04:10.658
I bid four books.

02:04:10.908 --> 02:04:14.078
- Gotta get four. Stop talking shit.
- What?

02:04:14.411 --> 02:04:17.748
That's cool. Take your little shit.
Bring it back.

02:04:18.082 --> 02:04:20.501
Girl, you don't know
nothing about this.

02:04:20.751 --> 02:04:23.754
I got things going on
you wouldn't understand.

02:04:24.046 --> 02:04:26.674
- All that talking.
- That's all to Jesus.

02:04:26.924 --> 02:04:30.928
Nigga, put the card down!
Put the card down!

02:04:31.595 --> 02:04:33.430
I'm gonna take it.

02:04:33.764 --> 02:04:37.434
- I love you.
- I love you, but I'm gonna take that.

02:04:37.768 --> 02:04:39.603
Can I get some love?

02:04:39.812 --> 02:04:42.690
Don't say you love me
and don't give me no love.

02:04:45.943 --> 02:04:47.945
I get a little pickle tongue?

02:04:53.617 --> 02:04:56.620
Okay, back to the ass whuppin'.
Here we go.

02:04:56.954 --> 02:05:01.125
Talk to me, baby.
Should I bid for nine?

02:05:01.625 --> 02:05:05.296
Bam, nigga! What nine?
You better get your three bucks.

02:05:05.629 --> 02:05:07.798
Be gentle with my baby, okay?

02:05:08.132 --> 02:05:11.385
- I know. I should.
- You'll create a gangsta.

02:05:11.635 --> 02:05:15.472
It's a girl. This one is mine.
I need a girl.

02:05:15.681 --> 02:05:19.476
It was doing the Crip walk
last night. It's a boy.

02:05:19.810 --> 02:05:22.646
No, it's a girl.
Please give me a girl!
