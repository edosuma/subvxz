02:36.198 --> 02:40.035
Countess of Morcar's,
thanks.

02:42.329 --> 02:44.081
My God,
she's back.

02:48.710 --> 02:51.213
She's getting out
of the carriage.

02:51.296 --> 02:53.632
Come on, Ryder,
get a move on.

02:59.221 --> 03:00.806
...look lively.

03:00.889 --> 03:01.723
All right.

03:01.807 --> 03:02.683
Get moving.

03:02.766 --> 03:03.684
All right.

03:03.767 --> 03:05.227
Her ladyship won't want
workmen under her feet.

03:05.352 --> 03:06.687
All right, I finished,
don't worry,

03:06.770 --> 03:08.313
quick job,
like you said.

03:18.907 --> 03:22.202
Oh, yeah,
yeah, nice, nice.

03:25.581 --> 03:27.416
Countess, eh?

03:27.499 --> 03:29.501
Have to get by
appointment only...

03:29.585 --> 03:31.003
Come on, lad,
out.

03:50.272 --> 03:51.857
All right.

04:31.480 --> 04:33.482
Over there
will do.

04:42.199 --> 04:45.077
Here, for the
three of you.

04:45.160 --> 04:46.870
Thank you,
milady,

04:46.995 --> 04:48.914
and a Merry Christmas,
milady.

04:54.837 --> 04:56.296
Ring for tea,
Cusack.

04:56.380 --> 04:57.965
Yes, milady.

04:58.090 --> 05:00.634
I need something
to sustain me.

05:00.717 --> 05:04.429
I do find preparing for
Christmas quite an ordeal.

05:04.513 --> 05:06.640
Yes, milady.

05:06.723 --> 05:12.312
And then,
a bath, I think.

05:51.685 --> 05:53.187
Milady.

05:53.312 --> 05:57.357
The blue carbuncle,

05:57.482 --> 06:05.199
the blue carbuncle,
it's stolen.

06:15.167 --> 06:18.295
Open them up,
there.

06:18.420 --> 06:24.176
Oh, John, she'll love it,
it is beautiful.

06:24.259 --> 06:26.595
Just like
her mother.

06:26.720 --> 06:29.348
But can we
afford it, though?

06:29.431 --> 06:32.935
I told you, I made a nice
little bob or two lately.

06:33.060 --> 06:36.772
Even if I hadn't,
it's Christmas.

06:36.897 --> 06:39.066
You're a good man,
John Horner.

06:39.149 --> 06:40.692
I'm a
lucky man,

06:40.776 --> 06:43.278
a wife and kids
like I've got,

06:43.403 --> 06:45.572
means as good
as a king.

06:45.656 --> 06:48.784
So, it's the doll
for the girl,

06:48.909 --> 06:51.245
and the boat
for the boy, right?

06:51.328 --> 06:53.205
Right.

06:53.288 --> 06:57.960
Spending the loot already,
are we, Horner?

06:58.085 --> 06:59.837
What do
you mean?

06:59.962 --> 07:01.421
I've done nothing,
what do you mean?

07:01.547 --> 07:03.215
John Frederick
Horner,

07:03.298 --> 07:05.217
I hereby arrest you on
the charge of stealing

07:05.300 --> 07:08.595
the valuable gem known
as the blue carbuncle,

07:08.679 --> 07:10.973
the property of
the Countess of Morcar.

07:11.056 --> 07:12.224
Anything you say...

07:12.307 --> 07:14.059
I didn't do it, I tell you,
I didn't do it.

07:14.142 --> 07:16.562
...the men at
the hotel gave

07:16.645 --> 07:18.856
a very good
description of you.

07:18.981 --> 07:19.773
Constable,

07:19.857 --> 07:22.150
I didn't do it,
I tell you,

07:22.276 --> 07:24.152
let me go, will you,
I didn't do it.

07:25.571 --> 07:26.530
Oh.

08:24.755 --> 08:26.632
Mr. Holmes?

08:31.720 --> 08:33.722
Mr. Holmes?

08:33.804 --> 08:36.850
Mr. Peterson, the
commissionaire from Upasit...

08:36.975 --> 08:39.186
Oh, please,
go away.

08:39.311 --> 08:40.562
...he'd like
a word with you.

08:40.687 --> 08:41.938
Oh.

09:01.458 --> 09:04.336
I'm sorry to disturb you,
Mr. Holmes.

09:04.419 --> 09:17.558
Peterson, put down your goose,
and your, your hat.

09:17.683 --> 09:19.226
It's a fine
purchase,

09:19.309 --> 09:22.563
I myself favor a goose
for Christmas dinner.

09:22.646 --> 09:24.940
Well, that's
part of the problem,

09:25.065 --> 09:28.235
Mr. Holmes, the bird
is not mine.

09:28.360 --> 09:31.280
You might say,
I come by it.

09:31.363 --> 09:36.076
Oh,
"for Mrs. Henry Baker,"

09:36.159 --> 09:37.995
and obviously,
not your hat.

09:38.120 --> 09:39.079
No, sir.

09:39.204 --> 09:40.622
Well, there were
peculiar circumstances,

09:40.706 --> 09:42.499
and I didn't know what
to do for the best.

09:42.624 --> 09:44.835
It hardly seemed a matter
for the police.

09:44.960 --> 09:46.587
So I talked to
the wife about it,

09:46.670 --> 09:48.463
and she suggested
I come and see you.

09:48.589 --> 09:50.591
The wise
Mrs. Peterson.

09:50.716 --> 09:52.426
Sit down,
my dear fellow,

09:52.551 --> 09:54.845
and describe these peculiar
circumstances to me.

09:54.970 --> 09:59.308
Well, sir,
it was like this.

09:59.433 --> 10:01.977
Last night I was on my
way home from a little,

10:02.102 --> 10:04.313
uh, celebration.

10:04.438 --> 10:06.190
Well, at this time
of the year

10:06.315 --> 10:08.025
some of us commissionairs
meet to -

10:08.150 --> 10:10.485
To wish each other
the season's greetings.

10:10.569 --> 10:11.653
Exactly.

10:11.778 --> 10:13.655
The season's
greetings.

10:13.780 --> 10:16.283
Oh, you're a top,
sir.

10:16.408 --> 10:19.494
Your good health,
sir.

10:19.620 --> 10:25.626
Well, as I was saying,
I was on my way home

10:25.751 --> 10:29.379
when I came across what you
would only describe as a frakel.

11:11.839 --> 11:15.300
Oy,
what's happening?

11:15.384 --> 11:17.970
Blimey, it's a
copper,...

11:18.053 --> 11:19.721
get out of here.

11:22.558 --> 11:24.351
get out of here.

11:28.438 --> 11:30.899
I'm trying
to help you, man.

11:37.406 --> 11:39.366
Well, the roughs ran
off in one direction,

11:39.491 --> 11:41.577
and the drunk fellow
ran off in the other.

11:41.702 --> 11:43.662
I tried to stop him,
but he no doubt thought

11:43.745 --> 11:45.539
I was a constable about
to apprehend him

11:45.622 --> 11:47.416
for the breaking
of the window.

11:47.541 --> 11:49.585
And so you left with
the spoils of victory

11:49.710 --> 11:51.253
in the shape
of that battered hat,

11:51.378 --> 11:53.255
and a most unimpeachable
Christmas goose.

11:53.338 --> 11:55.257
Both of which
I would willingly

11:55.382 --> 11:56.884
have returned to their
rightful owners, Mr. Holmes,

11:57.009 --> 12:00.179
but the truth is,
I didn't know how.

12:00.262 --> 12:04.099
My dear Peterson,
I do see your problem.

12:04.224 --> 12:06.226
Anyway,
as I say,

12:06.351 --> 12:08.437
I discussed the matter
with the good lady,

12:08.562 --> 12:10.189
and we decided that
I would bring both

12:10.272 --> 12:13.358
the goose and the hat
to you, Mr. Holmes,

12:13.442 --> 12:16.403
seeing as how even the slightest
of problems is of interest

12:16.486 --> 12:21.617
to you in your particular
line of occupation.

12:21.742 --> 12:27.706
I hope you don't think I'm
wasting your time, Mr. Holmes.

12:27.789 --> 12:31.126
Not in
the least.

12:31.251 --> 12:32.544
Now then,
Commissionaire,

12:32.628 --> 12:35.339
have you purchased
your own bird?

12:35.464 --> 12:36.423
No,
not yet.

12:36.548 --> 12:39.384
Then I suggest that you carry
off this goose so that it

12:39.468 --> 12:43.222
may fulfill its
ultimate destiny,

12:43.305 --> 12:45.516
while I retain the battered
hat of the unknown gentleman

12:45.641 --> 12:47.267
who has lost his
Christmas dinner.

12:47.351 --> 12:49.019
Well, if you think
I should, Mr. Holmes.

12:49.144 --> 12:50.938
I do,
indeed.

12:51.021 --> 12:53.524
For there are signs,
in spite of the frost,

12:53.649 --> 12:54.775
that this bird
should be prepared

12:54.858 --> 12:57.528
without unnecessary
delay.

12:57.653 --> 12:59.279
Well, if that's
all right, Mr. Holmes.

12:59.404 --> 13:00.614
I will of course,

13:00.739 --> 13:02.908
keep you in touch
with the developments.

13:02.991 --> 13:04.409
Very good,
sir.

13:04.493 --> 13:07.621
Oh, uh, may I wish you
the complements of the season.

13:07.704 --> 13:09.706
And to you and your
good wife.

13:23.428 --> 13:27.266
But you still haven't
found the jewel.

13:27.349 --> 13:29.810
Not yet,
no, milady,

13:29.893 --> 13:32.145
but we do have
the man, Horner.

13:32.229 --> 13:34.857
Or have a clue
as to its whereabouts.

13:34.982 --> 13:36.859
And I think we may
assume that

13:36.984 --> 13:40.320
he had one accomplice,
if not more.

13:40.404 --> 13:42.364
Well,
what of that?

13:42.489 --> 13:45.200
Contrary to popular
fiction, milady,

13:45.325 --> 13:47.953
there is very little
honor amongst thieves,

13:48.036 --> 13:51.331
and even less with
the right inducement.

13:51.415 --> 13:55.627
Inducement,
do you mean a reward?

13:55.711 --> 13:58.672
Uh, yes.

13:58.755 --> 14:02.342
Why should I offer
a reward?

14:02.467 --> 14:06.180
In my experience,
and it is considerable,

14:06.305 --> 14:09.057
I have found that
the offer of a reward

14:09.183 --> 14:13.187
would very soon set the greedy
cat amongst the criminal pigeon.

14:13.270 --> 14:15.522
Well?

14:15.647 --> 14:17.524
I should be
very surprised

14:17.608 --> 14:21.278
if I did not gain a result
within 24 hours.

14:25.782 --> 14:27.534
How much?

14:28.619 --> 14:30.078
Holmes?

14:30.204 --> 14:32.122
Oh,
you're up.

14:32.247 --> 14:34.875
The Countess of Morcar
is offering a thousand pounds

14:34.958 --> 14:37.836
for the return
of the blue carbuncle.

14:37.920 --> 14:39.463
Inspector Bradstreet
of B Division

14:39.588 --> 14:41.423
is in charge
of the case,

14:41.548 --> 14:43.467
and has arrested
Mr. John Horner,

14:43.592 --> 14:45.844
a plumber,
age 36,

14:45.928 --> 14:49.139
who protested his innocence
in the strongest terms.

14:49.264 --> 14:51.850
Circumstantial evidence
was so strong that the case

14:51.934 --> 14:54.603
has been referred
to the Assizes.

14:54.728 --> 14:58.690
Horner, who showed signs
of intense emotion

14:58.774 --> 15:01.652
during the proceedings,
faded away at the conclusion

15:01.777 --> 15:05.113
and was carried
from the court.

15:05.197 --> 15:08.408
Oh, excuse me,
you are engaged.

15:08.492 --> 15:12.538
I am interrupting your
study of that hat.

15:12.621 --> 15:18.085
No, no, no, the matter
is a perfectly trivial one.

15:18.210 --> 15:20.379
But there are points
in connection with it

15:20.462 --> 15:25.300
which are not devoid
of interest,

15:25.384 --> 15:27.761
even of instruction.

15:27.845 --> 15:29.972
I suppose that homely
as it looks,

15:30.097 --> 15:33.058
that thing has some deadly
story linked to it that

15:33.141 --> 15:36.353
is the clue which will guide you
in the solution of some mystery

15:36.478 --> 15:39.273
and the punishment
of some crime.

15:39.356 --> 15:43.443
No, no,
no, no,

15:43.569 --> 15:46.530
it is just one of those
whimsical little instance

15:46.655 --> 15:49.116
that will occur when you
have four million people

15:49.116 --> 15:53.120
jostling each other within the
space of a few square miles.

15:53.203 --> 15:58.000
So, what do you gather
from that battered old felt?

15:58.083 --> 16:00.419
You know
my methods.

16:00.502 --> 16:03.839
What do you yourself
gather as to the individuality

16:03.964 --> 16:08.135
of the man who has worn
this particular article?

16:11.221 --> 16:15.392
It was accompanied
by a goose, Watson.

16:15.517 --> 16:17.853
"For Mrs. Henry Baker,"
was printed upon a small card

16:17.936 --> 16:20.689
attached to the bird's
left leg.

16:26.361 --> 16:28.113
Well, apart from
the initials inside,

16:28.197 --> 16:31.783
H.B.,
presumably Henry Baker...

16:34.203 --> 16:37.164
...I can
see nothing.

16:37.247 --> 16:40.501
On the contrary, Watson,
you can see everything,

16:40.584 --> 16:42.377
but you fail to reason
for what you see.

16:42.503 --> 16:45.756
You are too timid in drawing
your inferences.

16:45.881 --> 16:47.758
Then, pray,

16:47.883 --> 16:52.554
tell me what it is that you
can infer from that hat?

16:52.679 --> 16:56.725
That the man
is highly intellectual

16:56.850 --> 16:59.186
is, of course,
obvious.

16:59.269 --> 17:01.355
And also that he was
fairly well-to-do

17:01.438 --> 17:03.398
within the past
three years,

17:03.524 --> 17:05.692
although now he has
fallen upon evil days.

17:05.776 --> 17:08.862
He had foresight,
but less now than formerly,

17:08.987 --> 17:12.406
pointing to a moral
retrogression,

17:12.491 --> 17:15.243
which, when taken with the
decline of his fortunes,

17:15.368 --> 17:22.751
seems to indicate an evil
influence, probably drink.

17:22.835 --> 17:25.087
This may account also
for the fact that his wife

17:25.212 --> 17:27.589
has ceased
to love him.

17:27.673 --> 17:29.550
My dear, Holmes.

17:29.633 --> 17:33.428
He has, however, retained
some degree of self-respect,

17:33.554 --> 17:36.139
and now he leads
a sedentary life,

17:36.265 --> 17:38.559
is out of training
entirely.

17:38.642 --> 17:40.853
He's middle-aged,
has grizzled hair

17:40.936 --> 17:45.107
which he has had cut within
the last few days,

17:45.232 --> 17:47.818
and which he anoints
with lime-cream.

17:47.943 --> 17:52.030
It is also highly improbable
that he has gas

17:52.114 --> 17:54.658
laid on in
his house.

17:54.783 --> 17:59.454
Well, now you are
certainly joking.

17:59.580 --> 18:02.249
Not in
the least.

18:02.374 --> 18:05.961
Well, I have no doubt
that I am very stupid.

18:06.086 --> 18:10.299
For example, how do you deduce
that the man is intellectual?

18:10.424 --> 18:12.968
It is a question
of cubic capacity.

18:15.095 --> 18:20.058
A man with so large a head
must have something in it.

18:20.142 --> 18:25.147
Well, the decline
in his fortunes, then?

18:25.272 --> 18:28.358
These flat brims
with the curled edges

18:28.483 --> 18:29.902
came in three
years ago.

18:29.985 --> 18:33.530
It is a hat of the very
best quality, Watson.

18:33.655 --> 18:37.409
Look at the band of ribbed
silk and the excellent lining.

18:37.493 --> 18:40.954
If this man could afford
so expensive a hat

18:41.038 --> 18:43.081
three years ago,
and has had no hat since,

18:43.165 --> 18:45.876
then he has assuredly
gone down in the world.

18:46.001 --> 18:49.838
What about the foresight
and the moral retrogression?

18:49.922 --> 18:51.298
Ah, here is
the foresight,

18:51.381 --> 18:55.177
these securers are
never sold upon hats.

18:55.260 --> 18:57.054
If this man
ordered one,

18:57.179 --> 18:58.889
it is a sign of a certain
amount of foresight,

18:59.014 --> 19:00.641
since he went
out of his way

19:00.766 --> 19:02.392
to take precaution
against the wind.

19:02.518 --> 19:05.020
But as you see that he
has broken the elastic

19:05.145 --> 19:07.397
and has not troubled
to replace it,

19:07.523 --> 19:09.775
a weakening
nature.

19:09.858 --> 19:11.235
Mmm.

19:11.360 --> 19:12.986
The further points,
that he is middle-aged,

19:13.111 --> 19:15.864
that his hair is grizzled,
that it has been cut recently,

19:15.989 --> 19:17.241
and that he anoints
it with lime-cream,

19:17.366 --> 19:18.575
can all to be gathered
by an inspection

19:18.700 --> 19:20.369
of the lower part
of the lining, Watson.

19:20.494 --> 19:24.706
Witness the moisture,
obviously a free perspirer,

19:24.832 --> 19:27.459
therefore, not
in the best of training.

19:27.543 --> 19:30.963
But his -
his wife,

19:31.046 --> 19:34.466
you said she had
ceased to love him.

19:34.550 --> 19:36.718
This hat has not been
brushed for weeks.

19:36.844 --> 19:38.846
When I see a man

19:38.929 --> 19:41.098
with a week's accumulation
of dust upon his hat,

19:41.223 --> 19:44.476
and his wife has allowed him
to go out in such a state,

19:44.560 --> 19:46.061
I fear that he has been
unfortunate enough

19:46.186 --> 19:48.355
to lose his wife's
affections.

19:48.480 --> 19:50.023
He might be
a bachelor.

19:50.148 --> 19:53.485
Nay, but he brought a goose
as a peace offering to his wife.

19:53.569 --> 19:56.363
Remember the card
attached to the bird's leg.

19:56.446 --> 20:01.201
Yes, well, you have an answer
to everything.

20:01.326 --> 20:04.288
Just a minute,
just a minute,

20:04.413 --> 20:11.336
how do you deduce that there is
no gas laid on in his house?

20:11.420 --> 20:14.882
One tallow
candle stain,

20:15.007 --> 20:16.341
or even two, might
come by chance;

20:16.425 --> 20:19.303
but when I see, Watson,
no less than five,

20:19.428 --> 20:23.390
he never got candle
stains from a gas jet, Watson.

20:23.515 --> 20:26.852
Are you
satisfied?

20:26.935 --> 20:28.353
Well, it's
all very ingenious.

20:28.562 --> 20:32.858
Mr. Holmes, the goose,
the goose, Mr. Holmes.

20:32.941 --> 20:34.067
Well, what of it, man,
has it come back to life

20:34.193 --> 20:37.112
and flapped off through
the kitchen window?

20:37.237 --> 20:39.406
No, no sir, no sir,
but see,

20:39.489 --> 20:43.785
see what the wife
found in its crop.

20:47.956 --> 20:52.503
By Jove, Peterson, this is
a treasure-trove indeed.

20:52.628 --> 20:54.421
You know what
you've got?

20:54.505 --> 20:56.256
A diamond,
a precious stone.

20:56.340 --> 20:58.425
It cuts glass
like it was putty.

20:58.509 --> 21:02.930
It is more than
a precious stone.

21:03.013 --> 21:06.266
It is the
precious stone.

21:06.391 --> 21:08.435
The Hotel
Cosmopolitan robbery,

21:08.519 --> 21:11.230
the blue
carbuncle.

21:11.313 --> 21:16.443
The blue carbuncle,
indeed.

21:26.995 --> 21:29.373
It is absolutely
unique,

21:29.498 --> 21:31.250
its value can only
be conjectured.

21:31.333 --> 21:33.043
And your reward,
Peterson,

21:33.168 --> 21:35.128
of 1000 pounds is not
within a twentieth

21:35.254 --> 21:36.880
of its
market price.

21:37.005 --> 21:40.175
A thousand pounds, oh,
Lord have mercy.

21:40.300 --> 21:42.177
You must admit,
Watson,

21:42.261 --> 21:45.097
that my deductions in
regard to this hat

21:45.180 --> 21:47.516
have suddenly assumed
a more important aspect.

21:47.599 --> 21:49.476
Yes, point taken,
Holmes.

21:49.476 --> 21:51.520
Now, the question for us
now to solve is to trace

21:51.645 --> 21:55.148
the sequence of events from a
rifled jewel case at one end,

21:55.232 --> 21:58.110
to the crop
of a goose at the other.

21:58.193 --> 22:01.572
There is
the stone.

22:01.697 --> 22:03.156
The stone came
from the goose,

22:03.240 --> 22:06.702
the goose came from
Mr. Henry Baker,

22:06.827 --> 22:07.828
the gentleman with
the shabby hat

22:07.953 --> 22:09.538
and all the other
characteristics.

22:09.663 --> 22:12.666
So, now, we must set
ourselves very seriously

22:12.791 --> 22:15.085
to finding this
gentleman,

22:15.210 --> 22:17.838
and to ascertaining what
part he had to play

22:17.963 --> 22:19.715
in this little
mystery.

22:19.840 --> 22:22.384
Found at the corner
of Goodge Street,

22:22.509 --> 22:24.511
a goose and
a black felt hat.

22:24.636 --> 22:27.472
Mr. Henry Baker can have same by
applying at 6:30 this evening

22:27.556 --> 22:32.311
at 221B, Baker Street,
clear and concise.

22:32.394 --> 22:34.479
Yes, very,
but will he see it?

22:34.563 --> 22:36.732
Well, I'm sure he will keep
an eye on the evening papers,

22:36.857 --> 22:39.776
for the poor man,
the loss was a heavy one.

22:39.902 --> 22:42.070
Oh, Peterson, uh, just nip down
to the advertising agency

22:42.196 --> 22:45.199
and have this put in
all the evening papers.

22:45.324 --> 22:46.408
Which, one,
sir?

22:46.533 --> 22:48.243
The Globe, Star, Pall Mall,
St. James's Bissett, Echo,

22:48.368 --> 22:49.244
Evening News,
Standard,

22:49.328 --> 22:52.247
and all the others
that may occur to you.

22:52.331 --> 22:53.415
Right away,
sir.

22:53.540 --> 22:55.250
And
the stone?

22:55.375 --> 22:58.879
I shall keep
the stone.

22:58.962 --> 23:00.422
Thank you,
Peterson.

23:00.506 --> 23:01.924
Yes, sir.

23:02.049 --> 23:04.218
Oh, and Peterson,

23:04.301 --> 23:06.970
uh, would you pick up
a goose on your way back?

23:07.095 --> 23:08.639
Give him the money,
will you, Watson.

23:08.764 --> 23:11.016
We must have something
to give Mr. Henry Baker

23:11.099 --> 23:12.893
to take the place
of the one

23:13.018 --> 23:15.437
which your family will
very soon be devouring.

23:15.521 --> 23:16.813
Oh, thank you,
sir.

23:16.939 --> 23:18.565
A thousand
pounds?

23:18.649 --> 23:20.609
A thousand
pounds.

23:20.734 --> 23:25.197
A thousand pounds,
a thousand pounds.

23:25.280 --> 23:33.747
Um, what, uh, will you
do with the stone?

23:33.831 --> 23:39.294
I shall keep it
in my museum.

23:55.978 --> 24:00.482
Well, Horner,

24:00.607 --> 24:04.278
Her Ladyship is not
at all pleased with me.

24:04.361 --> 24:06.238
You might be under
lock and key,

24:06.321 --> 24:08.323
but she'd rather her
blue carbuncle was.

24:08.407 --> 24:10.200
Never took it
Inspector...

24:10.325 --> 24:12.119
Well -

24:12.244 --> 24:14.955
Tell me what you did
with it, and, uh,

24:15.080 --> 24:17.416
I'll put in a good
word at your trial.

24:17.499 --> 24:18.959
But, if you don't -

24:19.042 --> 24:21.128
I've been on
the straight for years,

24:21.253 --> 24:23.046
ever since
I married Jenny.

24:23.172 --> 24:24.965
If you don't,

24:25.048 --> 24:26.884
and when the judge hears
about your previous conviction,

24:27.009 --> 24:33.056
you might never see your
pretty wife again.

24:33.182 --> 24:38.854
I've got you, Horner,
but I need that jewel.

24:43.400 --> 24:46.737
It's a bonny
thing,

24:46.862 --> 24:51.325
just see how it
glints and sparkles.

24:51.408 --> 24:54.161
Of course, it is a nucleus
and focus of crime,

24:54.244 --> 24:55.704
every good
stone is.

24:55.829 --> 24:58.332
They are the devil's
pet baits.

24:58.415 --> 25:01.460
In the larger
and older jewels

25:01.543 --> 25:05.005
every facet may stand
for a bloody deed.

25:05.130 --> 25:11.553
It was found in the banks of the
Amoy River in southern China,

25:11.637 --> 25:15.849
and is remarkable in having
every characteristic of the carbuncle,

25:15.974 --> 25:19.436
save that it is blue
instead of ruby red.

25:19.561 --> 25:24.024
This stone is not yet
twenty years old.

25:24.107 --> 25:25.943
Mmm.

25:26.068 --> 25:28.111
In spite
of its youth,

25:28.237 --> 25:30.822
it already has
a sinister history.

25:30.906 --> 25:33.659
There have been
two murders,

25:33.742 --> 25:35.536
a vitriol-throwing,
a suicide,

25:35.661 --> 25:37.704
and several robberies
brought about for the sake

25:37.788 --> 25:41.041
of this forty-grain weight
of crystallized charcoal.

25:41.124 --> 25:43.877
Who would think that
so pretty a toy

25:44.002 --> 25:47.840
could be a purveyor
to the gallows and the prison?

25:52.427 --> 25:53.220
Come in.

25:54.596 --> 25:58.475
Mr. Henry Baker,
I believe?

25:58.600 --> 26:03.814
Please,
draw near the fire.

26:03.939 --> 26:07.442
It is a cold night and I observe
that your circulation

26:07.568 --> 26:09.736
is more adapted for
summer than for winter.

26:09.862 --> 26:12.865
Do sit down.

26:12.948 --> 26:15.450
This is my friend and colleague,
Dr. Watson.

26:15.534 --> 26:17.244
How do you do,
sir?

26:17.327 --> 26:21.748
Mr. Baker...

26:26.128 --> 26:29.965
is that your hat?

26:30.090 --> 26:38.265
Oh, yes, oh,
it is undoubtedly my hat.

26:38.390 --> 26:40.559
Thank you,
sir.

26:40.642 --> 26:44.771
I would have advertised
its loss but shillings

26:44.897 --> 26:48.483
have not been so plentiful
with me as they once were.

26:48.609 --> 26:51.236
I had no doubt that
the gang of roughs

26:51.320 --> 26:55.240
who assaulted me had carried
off both my hat and the bird.

26:55.324 --> 26:58.410
I did not care to
spend more money

26:58.494 --> 27:00.621
in a hopeless attempt
at recovering them.

27:00.746 --> 27:03.499
Yes, well, of course,
that is very understandable.

27:03.624 --> 27:06.335
Oh, by the way,
about your bird,

27:06.460 --> 27:12.799
we were compelled
to eat it.

27:12.883 --> 27:15.260
To eat it.

27:15.344 --> 27:19.264
It would have been of little use
to anyone had we not done so.

27:19.348 --> 27:22.309
But we have another goose
upon the sideboard there,

27:22.392 --> 27:25.312
which I presume will answer
your purpose equally well.

27:25.395 --> 27:26.813
It is about
the same weight,

27:26.897 --> 27:29.483
and perfectly fresh,
as you can see.

27:29.608 --> 27:32.402
Oh, yes,
most certainly.

27:32.528 --> 27:37.449
Of course, we have kept
the feathers, legs, crop,

27:37.533 --> 27:40.744
and so on of your own
bird, if you so wish.

27:40.869 --> 27:42.830
It might be useful to me
as relics of my adventure,

27:42.913 --> 27:45.958
but beyond
that I can hardly see

27:46.041 --> 27:49.378
what use the disjectamembra
of my old acquaintance

27:49.503 --> 27:52.172
could possibly
be to me.

27:52.297 --> 27:54.216
Oh, no, sir,
with your permission,

27:54.341 --> 27:56.802
I - I shall confine
my attentions

27:56.885 --> 28:00.097
to the excellent bird which
I perceive upon your sideboard.

28:00.222 --> 28:02.224
I would be
interested to know

28:02.349 --> 28:03.308
where the other
bird came from.

28:03.433 --> 28:05.686
You see, I am somewhat
of a fowl fancier,

28:05.811 --> 28:08.605
and I have seldom seen
a better grown bird.

28:08.730 --> 28:10.524
It would be of great
interest to me to know

28:10.649 --> 28:13.735
precisely how it came
into your possession.

28:13.861 --> 28:17.322
It was the club, sir,
the goose club.

28:17.406 --> 28:23.036
The goose club,
the exact circumstances?

28:23.120 --> 28:25.789
I - I
am not a rich man,

28:25.914 --> 28:28.876
as you may see, sir,
but I make a humble living,

28:29.001 --> 28:31.628
and a respectable one,
if I may say so,

28:31.753 --> 28:33.881
in the British
Museum.

28:33.964 --> 28:36.550
Studying?

28:36.633 --> 28:41.555
Studying,
you might say,

28:41.638 --> 28:44.099
and helping others
with their studies.

28:44.224 --> 28:47.644
I - I have a certain
knowledge of books.

28:47.769 --> 28:51.440
That day, sir, I had
finished work early

28:51.565 --> 28:55.777
and left the museum
in the afternoon.

28:55.903 --> 28:58.655
I had a little
business to attend to

28:58.780 --> 29:01.366
before calling in at
the Alpha Public House.

29:01.450 --> 29:03.869
Several of us who
work in the museum

29:03.952 --> 29:04.786
frequent that
establishment,

29:04.912 --> 29:07.456
and this year
our good host,

29:07.581 --> 29:11.210
Mr. Windigate,
had instigated a goose club,

29:11.293 --> 29:14.087
by which, on consideration of
some few pence each week,

29:14.213 --> 29:18.425
we were to receive a bird
at Christmas.

29:24.097 --> 29:25.891
There we are,
Mr. Baker,

29:25.974 --> 29:28.227
a very fine bird,
as promised.

29:30.979 --> 29:35.484
Magnificent specimen,
indeed, landlord, eh.

29:35.609 --> 29:38.487
Put you back in the wife's
good books, eh?

29:38.570 --> 29:42.866
Well, she is still somewhat
irked with me, I'm afraid.

29:42.991 --> 29:46.662
Things may doubtless
improve when I am

29:46.787 --> 29:49.498
once more in gainful
employment.

29:49.623 --> 29:51.166
Oh, an academic nature,
of course.

29:51.291 --> 29:53.669
I have
expectations.

29:53.794 --> 29:59.925
Well, I owe you one last
payment of eight pennies, eh.

30:00.008 --> 30:03.053
Struck it rich,
have we, Mr. B?

30:03.178 --> 30:05.347
I chanced upon
an acquaintance

30:05.472 --> 30:09.810
of sympathetic disposition,
l, that is to say,

30:09.893 --> 30:14.022
I sold some
of my books.

30:14.147 --> 30:18.944
Oh, not your books,
Mr. Baker.

30:19.027 --> 30:21.488
Needs must,
Mr. Windigate,

30:21.572 --> 30:23.740
and at this season of
the year more than ever,

30:23.866 --> 30:26.910
we must not deprive
those we love,

30:27.035 --> 30:32.082
or even those to whom
we are married.

30:32.207 --> 30:35.043
And so, if you will set aside
this impressive peace offering,

30:35.169 --> 30:38.088
I shall fortify myself
for the fray

30:38.213 --> 30:40.549
with a large
glass of whiskey,

30:40.674 --> 30:43.302
and a pint of your
most excellent beer.

30:54.563 --> 30:55.898
Merry Christmas
to you.

30:56.023 --> 30:57.107
Same to you,
Mr. Baker.

31:04.281 --> 31:07.034
Well, sir,
on my way home

31:07.117 --> 31:09.244
I was attacked by
the gang of roughs,

31:09.369 --> 31:11.830
who I believed had
stolen the goose.

31:11.955 --> 31:14.374
My hat came off
in the scuffle.

31:14.458 --> 31:16.418
I - I remember
little of it,

31:16.543 --> 31:18.921
save that a uniformed officer
appeared on the scene

31:19.004 --> 31:22.549
and we all
made off.

31:22.633 --> 31:25.385
Yes, of course,
we quite understand.

31:25.469 --> 31:26.428
In the
circumstances.

31:26.553 --> 31:29.431
Well, all is well
that ends well.

31:37.606 --> 31:40.859
I am most indebted to you,
sir, for your trouble.

31:40.943 --> 31:42.653
A scottish bonnet,
I fear,

31:42.778 --> 31:47.324
is fitted neither to my
years nor to my dignity.

31:47.449 --> 31:49.827
My complements of the
season to you, sir.

31:49.952 --> 31:53.330
And to you,
too, sir.

31:53.455 --> 31:57.584
Oh, thank you,
sir.

31:57.709 --> 32:01.296
Oh, uh,
by the way,

32:01.421 --> 32:03.882
do you have gas laid
on in your house?

32:04.007 --> 32:08.095
Gas, alas, no.

32:08.220 --> 32:09.930
Jolly good.

32:10.013 --> 32:11.473
Merry Christmas.

32:11.598 --> 32:14.768
And to you both,
gentlemen.

32:14.893 --> 32:17.354
Well then, so much
for Mr. Henry Baker.

32:17.479 --> 32:20.274
He obviously knows
nothing of the matter.

32:20.357 --> 32:22.359
Ah,
Mrs. Hudson.

32:22.484 --> 32:24.778
Watson, do you
need nourishment?

32:24.862 --> 32:26.155
Not particularly.

32:26.280 --> 32:27.114
Splendid.

32:27.197 --> 32:29.616
Mrs. Hudson, we shall
turn dinner into supper,

32:29.700 --> 32:33.412
and we will follow up
this clue while it is still hot.

32:33.495 --> 32:36.623
Which is more than
the supper will be.

32:52.222 --> 32:55.309
Good evening, gentlemen,
and a very cold one.

32:55.392 --> 32:57.895
It is, indeed, landlord,
it is indeed.

32:58.020 --> 32:59.605
And what shall be
your pleasure?

32:59.688 --> 33:01.899
Beer, Watson?

33:02.024 --> 33:03.066
What? Oh, yes,
splendid.

33:03.192 --> 33:04.985
Two of your very best
glasses of beer.

33:05.068 --> 33:06.236
Right away,
sir.

33:06.361 --> 33:07.571
Your beer should
be excellent

33:07.696 --> 33:10.616
if it is as good
as your geese.

33:10.699 --> 33:12.951
What geese?

33:13.035 --> 33:14.995
Yes. We were talking,
um, half an hour ago

33:15.078 --> 33:18.874
to a Mr. Henry Baker, a member
of your goose club.

33:18.999 --> 33:21.668
Yes, but you see,
them's not our geese.

33:21.793 --> 33:24.129
Whose, then?

33:24.213 --> 33:26.673
Well, I got the whole
two dozen

33:26.757 --> 33:29.051
from a salesman
in Covent Garden.

33:29.176 --> 33:30.802
Who might
that be?

33:30.886 --> 33:32.763
Name of
Breckinridge,

33:32.888 --> 33:35.182
a purveyor
of the finest quality.

33:35.265 --> 33:37.351
Mind you, if it's
a bird you're after,

33:37.434 --> 33:39.645
I'd get to him
as soon as poss.

33:39.728 --> 33:40.938
Oh, it's a very
busy time of year,

33:41.063 --> 33:42.648
as you'll
appreciate.

33:42.731 --> 33:45.442
Well, thank you so much
for your advice.

33:45.567 --> 33:49.988
Will you have a glass
of beer with us, landlord?

33:50.072 --> 33:54.409
Well, God bless you
for a gentleman.

34:05.838 --> 34:09.424
Now, for
Mr. Breckinridge.

34:09.550 --> 34:11.426
Can't it wait?

34:11.552 --> 34:13.554
Watson, we have been given
a line of investigation

34:13.679 --> 34:16.098
which has been missed
by the police,

34:16.223 --> 34:18.934
and which a singular chance
has placed in our hands.

34:19.059 --> 34:21.103
Now, let us follow it
out to the bitter end.

34:21.228 --> 34:22.312
Extremely bitter.

34:22.437 --> 34:25.774
Faces to the south, then,
and quick, march.

34:39.788 --> 34:41.873
Please.

34:41.956 --> 34:51.507
I want to believe you,
John, I do, really,

34:51.632 --> 34:54.761
but I can't argue
with what the police is saying.

34:54.844 --> 34:58.640
But they're only saying that
cause I was there on the day.

34:58.765 --> 35:00.434
It was an
odd job.

35:00.559 --> 35:03.979
Is that really
the truth?

35:04.104 --> 35:06.064
I promised
when I married you,

35:06.148 --> 35:09.318
I'd never tell you
a lie.

35:09.443 --> 35:13.780
I kept my promise,
always will.

35:26.168 --> 35:28.712
I want to
believe you.

36:27.729 --> 36:29.106
Uh,
good evening.

36:29.231 --> 36:30.274
Good evening.

36:30.399 --> 36:32.317
Sold out of geese,
I see.

36:32.401 --> 36:34.653
Yeah, I'll have five hundred
in the morning.

36:34.736 --> 36:36.530
Too late,
I think.

36:36.655 --> 36:39.575
See the stall over there
with the gas fire, try him.

36:39.700 --> 36:42.369
Yes, but I was
recommended to you.

36:42.494 --> 36:43.704
Oh, who by?

36:43.787 --> 36:46.206
The landlord of
the Alpha Public House.

36:46.290 --> 36:48.834
Oh, yeah,
he had a couple of dozen off me.

36:48.917 --> 36:50.711
Very good geese, too.

36:50.794 --> 36:55.215
Where, may I ask,
did you get them?

36:55.299 --> 36:58.719
Here then, mister,

36:58.802 --> 37:00.429
what exactly are you
driving at?

37:00.554 --> 37:02.723
Come on, let's have
it straight, now.

37:02.848 --> 37:04.558
It's straight enough.

37:04.641 --> 37:06.935
I simply want to know
who sold you the geese

37:07.060 --> 37:08.770
that you supplied
to the Alpha.

37:08.896 --> 37:14.026
Well then, I'm not gonna
tell you, so now.

37:14.109 --> 37:17.696
It really is of no matter,
but I fail to see

37:17.779 --> 37:21.283
why you should get so warm
over a trifle.

37:21.408 --> 37:26.079
Warm, you'd be as warm if you
were as pestered as I am.

37:26.163 --> 37:28.123
When I pay good money
for a good article

37:28.207 --> 37:29.750
that should be
an end of it;

37:29.833 --> 37:31.293
but it's where
are the geese,

37:31.376 --> 37:32.628
who have
you sold them to,

37:32.753 --> 37:34.254
how much will you
take for them?

37:34.379 --> 37:36.131
You would think those were
the only geese in the world,

37:36.256 --> 37:38.634
the amount of fuss
that's made over them.

37:38.717 --> 37:40.719
Well, I can assure you
that I have no connection

37:40.802 --> 37:42.846
with anybody else
who's made inquiries.

37:42.971 --> 37:45.432
Inquiries, it's more
like the inquisition.

37:45.557 --> 37:48.852
I'm not
telling you.

37:48.977 --> 37:53.982
Ah, well then,
the bet is off.

37:54.107 --> 37:55.901
What bet?

37:55.984 --> 37:59.404
What bet?

37:59.488 --> 38:03.408
Well, I'm always ready
to back my opinion

38:03.492 --> 38:05.702
on the matter
of fowls,

38:05.828 --> 38:08.539
and I have a fiver
with my friend here

38:08.664 --> 38:13.293
that the bird that I chose
is country bred, right, Watson?

38:13.377 --> 38:16.755
What? Oh, oh, oh,
yes, yes, absolutely.

38:16.839 --> 38:20.008
Ah, you've lost your money
then, cause it's town bred.

38:20.133 --> 38:21.468
It is nothing
of the kind.

38:21.552 --> 38:22.761
I say it is.

38:22.845 --> 38:24.346
I don't
believe you.

38:24.429 --> 38:27.015
Come on, pay up,
Holmes.

38:27.140 --> 38:28.642
What, do you think
I wouldn't know,

38:28.767 --> 38:31.186
me, who's been handling fowl
since I was a nipper?

38:31.311 --> 38:32.145
I'll tell you,

38:32.229 --> 38:35.566
all the birds that went
to the Alpha were town bred.

38:35.691 --> 38:37.609
You'll never make me
believe that.

38:37.693 --> 38:40.779
Come on, come on,
do the decent, Holmes.

38:40.863 --> 38:42.364
Will you have a bet,
then?

38:42.447 --> 38:44.158
I'll be just taking
your money,

38:44.241 --> 38:45.909
but I'll have a sovereign
with you,

38:46.034 --> 38:48.453
just to teach you
not to be obstinate.

38:48.537 --> 38:49.663
Done.

38:49.788 --> 38:53.000
Right.

38:53.125 --> 38:54.710
Now then,
Mr. Cocksure,

38:54.835 --> 38:56.670
you see these here
books here, well,

38:56.753 --> 38:59.131
this is a list of all
the folk what I buy off.

38:59.214 --> 39:01.633
Now, on this page is
all me country folk,

39:01.717 --> 39:05.512
and these on this side in red
ink are all me town suppliers.

39:05.637 --> 39:09.558
Now you read out that
third name down to me.

39:09.683 --> 39:12.769
Mrs. Oakshott,
117 Brixton Road.

39:12.895 --> 39:15.063
Yeah, account
number 249.

39:15.189 --> 39:20.068
Go on, then, turn
it up in the ledger.

39:20.194 --> 39:22.863
Mrs. Oakshott,
egg and poultry supplier?

39:22.946 --> 39:25.199
Now, what's
the last entry?

39:25.282 --> 39:27.743
Twenty-four geese
at seven and six pence,

39:27.826 --> 39:33.373
sold to Mr. Windigate
of the Alpha Public House.

39:33.457 --> 39:36.335
So, what are you
gonna say now?

39:43.008 --> 39:46.345
What about this
gentleman's fiver?

40:00.692 --> 40:03.612
Well done,
Holmes.

40:03.695 --> 40:07.616
Shall we see this
Mrs. Oakshott tonight?

40:07.699 --> 40:09.117
Oh, no, not you again,
I've had enough of you.

40:09.201 --> 40:11.036
Listen, I've told you
before, clear off.

40:11.119 --> 40:13.205
But the thing is, there
were two gray-headed geese.

40:13.288 --> 40:15.958
Now, listen, I've had enough
of you and those geese.

40:16.083 --> 40:17.793
I wish you was all
at the devil together.

40:17.918 --> 40:20.087
If you come pestering me
any more with your silly talk

40:20.170 --> 40:21.505
I'll set
the dog on you.

40:21.630 --> 40:23.882
Now, look here,
Mrs. Oakshott told me -

40:23.966 --> 40:27.427
You bring Mrs. Oakshott here,
and I'll answer her,

40:27.553 --> 40:29.429
but what have you got
to do with it, eh?

40:29.513 --> 40:30.764
Did I buy the geese
off you?

40:30.889 --> 40:33.851
No; but one of them
was mine all the same.

40:33.976 --> 40:36.270
Well, you go and ask
Mrs. Oakshott for it.

40:36.395 --> 40:38.272
She told me
to ask you.

40:38.355 --> 40:41.108
You can ask the King of Prusia,
for all I care.

40:41.191 --> 40:42.442
I've had enough
of this.

40:42.526 --> 40:45.404
Go on,
get out of it.

40:45.487 --> 40:49.408
This may save us
a trip to Brixton.

41:38.123 --> 41:40.292
Excuse me, but I could
not help overhearing

41:40.375 --> 41:43.170
the conversation you had just
now with that salesman.

41:43.295 --> 41:46.006
I think I can be of assistance
to you in this matter.

41:46.089 --> 41:47.799
Yea,
who are you?

41:47.883 --> 41:49.384
My name
is Sherlock Holmes.

41:49.468 --> 41:52.596
It is my business to know
what other people don't know.

41:52.721 --> 41:54.056
But you could know
nothing of this.

41:54.181 --> 41:57.059
On the contrary,
I know everything of it.

41:57.184 --> 41:58.894
I know that you are
trying to find out

41:59.019 --> 42:01.897
the whereabouts of some geese
sold by Mrs. Oakshott,

42:02.022 --> 42:05.984
of Brixton Road, to our friend,
Mr. Breckinridge, over there.

42:06.068 --> 42:09.071
Who in turn, sold
them to Mr. Windigate,

42:09.196 --> 42:12.574
of the Alpha Public House.

42:12.699 --> 42:17.079
Sir, you're the very man
I have longed to meet.

42:17.204 --> 42:21.500
I can hardly explain to you
my interest in the matter.

42:21.583 --> 42:24.711
Then I suggest that we
carry on this conversation

42:24.795 --> 42:27.714
in rather
more comfort.

42:27.798 --> 42:29.716
Cab.

42:42.729 --> 42:47.693
Come in,
take my chair.

42:47.776 --> 42:53.740
I will just put
on my slippers.

42:53.824 --> 42:56.952
Ah.

42:57.077 --> 42:59.872
I think we should know
the name of the gentleman

42:59.955 --> 43:03.834
whom we have the pleasure
of assisting, don't you, Watson?

43:03.959 --> 43:05.961
John Robinson.

43:06.086 --> 43:07.462
Oh, no, no,
no, no;

43:07.588 --> 43:08.797
your real name.

43:08.922 --> 43:12.092
It is so awkward doing
business with an alias.

43:12.217 --> 43:14.052
Well then, uh,

43:14.136 --> 43:16.930
my real name is
Ryder, James Ryder.

43:17.014 --> 43:19.057
Yes, Mr. Ryder,

43:19.141 --> 43:24.730
upper attendant at
the Hotel Cosmopolitan.

43:24.813 --> 43:27.357
Yes.

43:27.483 --> 43:29.526
And I suppose you would
like to know what happened

43:29.651 --> 43:34.281
to these geese, or, rather,
one goose, in particular,

43:34.364 --> 43:36.950
white, with a gray head?

43:37.034 --> 43:41.079
Oh, sir, can you tell me
where it went to?

43:41.163 --> 43:43.123
It came here.

43:43.207 --> 43:44.666
Here?

43:44.750 --> 43:47.252
Sadly, it is
no longer here.

43:47.377 --> 43:52.341
But it laid an egg after
it was dead -

43:52.466 --> 44:01.475
the bonniest, brightest little
blue egg you have ever seen.

44:01.558 --> 44:07.356
Come, come,
I have it.

44:20.869 --> 44:25.958
The game is up,
Ryder.

44:26.041 --> 44:31.547
Bear up, man, you'll
be in the fire.

44:31.672 --> 44:34.591
And what a wretched little
shrimp it is, to be sure,

44:34.716 --> 44:37.678
there's enough blood
in him for felony.

44:37.803 --> 44:39.763
I have almost every link
in the chain, Ryder,

44:39.888 --> 44:43.183
you need tell
me very little.

44:43.267 --> 44:46.270
Catherine Cusack
put me up to it.

44:46.395 --> 44:47.855
Her Ladyship's maid.

44:47.980 --> 44:49.481
Exactly.

44:49.606 --> 44:51.567
You knew from local
gossip that Horner

44:51.650 --> 44:53.986
had been concerned in some
such matter before.

44:54.069 --> 44:56.572
So what did you do,

44:56.655 --> 45:00.075
you made some small job
in milady's room,

45:00.200 --> 45:03.203
you and your
confederate Cusack.

45:03.328 --> 45:06.582
You then managed that
Horner should be sent for.

45:06.707 --> 45:11.420
But you, you stole the jewel,
then you raised the alarm

45:11.545 --> 45:13.589
and had this
unfortunate man arrested.

45:13.714 --> 45:17.843
For God's sake,
Mr. Holmes, have mercy.

45:17.926 --> 45:20.512
Think of my father,
think of my mother,

45:20.596 --> 45:22.639
it would break
their hearts.

45:22.764 --> 45:24.224
I mean, I never
went wrong before,

45:24.308 --> 45:27.769
I never will again.
I swear it on a Bible.

45:27.853 --> 45:30.606
Oh, don't - don't bring
me to court, Mr. Holmes.

45:30.731 --> 45:32.941
For God's sake,
don't do that to me.

45:33.066 --> 45:36.778
Get back into
your chair.

45:36.904 --> 45:38.864
It is very well
to cringe and crawl now,

45:38.947 --> 45:40.908
but you thought little
of the man that you sent

45:40.991 --> 45:43.577
to the dock for a crime
of which he knew nothing.

45:43.660 --> 45:45.746
I'll fly,
Mr.Holmes.

45:45.829 --> 45:47.623
I'll leave
the country.

45:47.748 --> 45:53.128
Then the charge against him
will break down.

45:53.212 --> 45:57.007
We'll talk
about that later.

45:57.132 --> 46:02.429
Now tell me, how came
the stone into the goose,

46:02.513 --> 46:04.806
and how came the goose
into the open market?

46:04.932 --> 46:06.308
Tell me the truth, now,

46:06.433 --> 46:09.102
for that is your
only hope of safety.

46:09.186 --> 46:12.689
I'll tell it to you
just as it happened.

46:12.815 --> 46:15.275
I thought it was best
to get away with the stone

46:15.359 --> 46:17.194
as quick as I could,

46:17.319 --> 46:19.655
for I didn't know at what moment
the police might not take it

46:19.780 --> 46:25.160
into their heads
to search me and my room.

46:25.285 --> 46:27.329
There was nowhere in the hotel
where it would be safe.

46:27.454 --> 46:29.915
So, I went out,
as if on some commission,

46:29.998 --> 46:35.546
and made for my sister's
house to think things over.

46:35.671 --> 46:41.385
Why, Jim, whatever is it,
you look terrible.

46:41.510 --> 46:43.971
I had a bit of a turn,
Maggie.

46:44.096 --> 46:46.306
There's been a robbery
at the hotel.

46:46.431 --> 46:49.726
You'd better
come in.

46:49.852 --> 46:54.106
I went into the back yard
where she kept the geese,

46:54.189 --> 46:58.068
smoked a pipe, and wondered
what it would be best to do.

46:58.193 --> 47:00.112
I remember that my stomach
wasn't gonna stop

47:00.195 --> 47:02.698
feeling like
a bag of ferrets

47:02.781 --> 47:05.909
till I found somewhere
to hide the stone for a while,

47:06.034 --> 47:07.786
when suddenly,
I looked at the geese,

47:07.870 --> 47:11.623
which was hissing and huddling
in the corner of the yard.

47:11.707 --> 47:14.376
My sister had told me
that I might have the pick

47:14.501 --> 47:17.504
of her geese for
a Christmas present.

47:17.629 --> 47:20.549
I picked out one
of the birds,

47:20.674 --> 47:23.468
a fine thick one
with a gray head.

47:42.404 --> 47:44.323
I pushed the stone
down its throat

47:44.406 --> 47:47.493
as far as my finger
could reach.

47:47.576 --> 47:50.245
Then I thought all my
troubles was over, when...

47:50.370 --> 47:55.334
Whatever are you doing
with that bird, Jim?

47:55.417 --> 47:59.463
Uh, you said I could have
one for Christmas,

47:59.588 --> 48:01.965
so I was just feeling
which is the fattest.

48:02.090 --> 48:04.051
We already set
yours aside -

48:04.176 --> 48:06.887
Jim's bird,
we call it.

48:07.012 --> 48:09.223
Uh, if it's
all the same to you, Maggie,

48:09.348 --> 48:12.226
I'd rather have that
one I was handling just now.

48:12.309 --> 48:14.603
Well, that one is a good
three pounds heavier,

48:14.728 --> 48:16.730
we fattened it up
expressly.

48:16.855 --> 48:18.524
Never mind.

48:18.607 --> 48:21.235
I'll take the other,
and I'll take it now.

48:21.360 --> 48:22.778
Just as
you like.

48:22.903 --> 48:24.446
Which one
is it?

48:24.571 --> 48:26.532
It's that gray-headed one
in the middle.

48:26.615 --> 48:28.075
Oh,
very well.

48:28.158 --> 48:30.202
Kill it and take
it with you.

48:34.164 --> 48:36.124
I did what she said,
Mr. Holmes,

48:36.208 --> 48:39.920
and I carried the bird to
my pal, we got a knife,

48:40.045 --> 48:44.758
and we opened it up,
my heart turned to water,

48:44.883 --> 48:47.803
there was no sign
of the stone,

48:47.928 --> 48:51.098
and I knew some terrible
mistake must have occurred.

49:09.491 --> 49:11.118
Where have they
all gone?

49:11.201 --> 49:12.661
To the dealer's.

49:12.744 --> 49:13.662
Which dealer's?

49:13.787 --> 49:17.374
Breckinridge,
of Covent Garden.

49:17.499 --> 49:18.959
Tell me,
just tell me,

49:19.084 --> 49:22.337
was there another one
which had a gray head?

49:22.462 --> 49:24.423
That's right, two,

49:24.548 --> 49:27.134
I could never tell them apart,
I couldn't.

49:27.259 --> 49:30.679
Well, what's the matter,
what's all the hurry?

49:30.804 --> 49:32.472
I ran as hard
as my feet would carry me

49:32.556 --> 49:34.516
to this man
Breckinridge;

49:34.641 --> 49:36.894
but he had sold the lot,
and not one word

49:37.019 --> 49:40.272
would he tell me
as to where they had gone.

49:40.355 --> 49:44.318
I've gone mad.

49:44.443 --> 49:48.572
And now I'm
a branded thief,

49:48.697 --> 49:51.325
without ever having
touched the wealth

49:51.450 --> 49:54.995
for which I've sold
my character.

49:55.120 --> 50:00.042
God help me.
God help me.

50:14.056 --> 50:18.435
Get out.

50:18.560 --> 50:24.358
What?

50:24.441 --> 50:28.862
Heavens,
bless you, sir.

50:28.946 --> 50:32.115
No more words.

50:32.241 --> 50:35.118
Get out.

50:56.932 --> 50:58.141
I must confess,
Holmes,

50:58.267 --> 51:01.061
to being a little
surprised.

51:01.144 --> 51:10.112
I am not retained by the police
to supply their deficiencies.

51:10.237 --> 51:18.120
Maybe I am committing a felony,
but I may be saving a soul.

51:18.203 --> 51:21.582
Send him to jail now, you
make him a jailbird for life.

51:43.604 --> 51:48.400
Listen, after all, it is the
season for forgiveness, come.

51:48.484 --> 51:51.403
Midnight.

51:51.487 --> 51:53.780
Merry Christmas,
Holmes.

51:53.906 --> 51:56.950
And to you,
my dear friend.

51:57.034 --> 51:58.952
Just a minute.

51:59.036 --> 52:01.246
Holmes, I cannot
contemplate eating

52:01.330 --> 52:04.875
while John Horner
is still on remand.

52:05.000 --> 52:07.961
Do you suppose that Bradstreet
or one of his colleagues

52:08.086 --> 52:11.381
might still
be at their desks?

52:11.507 --> 52:16.011
You're quite right, Watson,
come, let's go.
