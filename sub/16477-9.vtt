WEBVTT

00:03.771 --> 00:05.773
(birds chirping)

00:09.077 --> 00:11.312
PETER ALDEN:
Duck hunting on a Navy base.

00:11.345 --> 00:13.347
That's a first for me.
(chuckles)

00:13.381 --> 00:14.782
Tom's a retired admiral.

00:14.815 --> 00:18.219
No one's said no to
him since... 1998?

00:18.252 --> 00:19.287
Only you, Jenna.

00:19.320 --> 00:21.189
True, but...

00:21.222 --> 00:23.524
I never say no to a hunt.

00:23.557 --> 00:25.826
Or a chance to beg
for Mr. Alden's money.

00:25.859 --> 00:27.795
You don't mince words.

00:27.828 --> 00:32.266
Things get done faster
if I say what I mean.

00:32.300 --> 00:35.369
I work hard for my constituents
and their businesses.

00:35.403 --> 00:37.471
You were just
reelected last month.

00:37.505 --> 00:42.376
So, I have less than
730 days to fund-raise.

00:42.410 --> 00:44.512
I don't usually write checks
on the first hunt.

00:44.545 --> 00:46.214
Enough shop talk.

00:46.247 --> 00:47.548
Let's be in nature.

00:47.581 --> 00:49.383
Enjoy the peace and quiet.

00:49.417 --> 00:50.584
(sighs)
(phone chimes)

00:50.618 --> 00:52.086
Oh, sorry, Congresswoman.

00:52.120 --> 00:53.321
You have that 10:00
in Georgetown.

00:53.354 --> 00:54.722
The modern world
always finds us.

00:54.755 --> 00:55.723
(chuckles)

00:55.756 --> 00:57.391
Would you mind, just...

00:57.425 --> 00:58.226
hold that for me?

00:59.893 --> 01:01.629
Thank you so much.

01:01.662 --> 01:02.630
Lord help me.
(sighs)

01:02.663 --> 01:03.764
I'm being assimilated.

01:03.797 --> 01:05.433
This app tracks
everything I eat

01:05.466 --> 01:06.667
by scanning the
product bar code.

01:06.700 --> 01:08.102
There we go.

01:08.136 --> 01:09.770
It's a mile hike
back to the cars,

01:09.803 --> 01:11.839
and I need protein.
Thank you.

01:11.872 --> 01:13.574
I prefer to get my protein
the old-fashioned way.

01:13.607 --> 01:15.309
By the looks of
your duck retriever,

01:15.343 --> 01:17.578
you're gonna starve.
(whimpers)

01:17.611 --> 01:19.347
(chuckles)

01:19.380 --> 01:20.848
We are not going
home empty-handed

01:20.881 --> 01:22.683
if I have anything
to say about it.

01:23.717 --> 01:24.785
You serious?

01:24.818 --> 01:26.554
I didn't come here
just to beg.

01:29.490 --> 01:31.659
(ducks quacking)

01:33.227 --> 01:35.529
ALDEN:
Who do I make that check out to?

01:35.563 --> 01:37.631
"Jenna Flemming
for Congress."

01:39.167 --> 01:41.235
Hmm. We'll be
in touch, boys.

01:42.903 --> 01:44.772
(dog whimpers, barks)

01:44.805 --> 01:47.841
There has got to be a more
humane way to get donors.

01:47.875 --> 01:50.378
In D.C.,
three dead bodies is nothing.

01:50.411 --> 01:51.712
Elections aren't cheap.

01:51.745 --> 01:54.282
Congresswoman, can you
enjoy the election we just won?

01:54.315 --> 01:56.116
Apparently not.

01:58.486 --> 01:59.487
Max!

02:00.521 --> 02:02.556
What?

02:04.425 --> 02:05.359
Oh, my God.

02:11.299 --> 02:13.301
*

02:43.597 --> 02:45.433
(elevator bell dings,
phones ringing)

02:45.466 --> 02:48.502
Cheese, the bacon,
the milk, the kale.

02:48.536 --> 02:50.438
Oh, actually, don't even
get me started on the greens,

02:50.471 --> 02:52.640
because I had to
throw them all away.

02:52.673 --> 02:55.643
Broken refrigerators
are the worst.

02:55.676 --> 02:58.979
Almost as bad as conversations
about broken refrigerators.

02:59.012 --> 03:00.348
(sighs) I'm so hungry.

03:00.381 --> 03:02.216
I'm so bored.
QUINN: Bishop,

03:02.250 --> 03:03.183
what about
your junk food?

03:03.217 --> 03:05.553
It should last, like, what?
Ten or 30 years?

03:05.586 --> 03:07.821
Quinn, I-I only have that
at work.

03:07.855 --> 03:08.589
Good morning.

03:08.622 --> 03:10.358
Hey.
So, uh,

03:10.391 --> 03:12.493
Bishop, talk to me about
the refrigerator situation.

03:12.526 --> 03:13.594
Lose any food or...

03:13.627 --> 03:14.495
McGee, no!
Come on!

03:14.528 --> 03:15.496
What?

03:15.529 --> 03:17.498
(sniffing)

03:17.531 --> 03:19.667
Ellie? You okay?

03:19.700 --> 03:21.935
I smell ketchup...

03:21.969 --> 03:23.437
and prawns.

03:23.471 --> 03:24.505
TORRES:
Yeah?

03:24.538 --> 03:26.374
She's having a stroke.
BISHOP: No.

03:26.407 --> 03:29.443
It is a specific flavor
of potato chip.

03:29.477 --> 03:31.579
REEVES:
Crisps!
(gasps)

03:31.612 --> 03:33.681
"Chips" are what
Americans call

03:33.714 --> 03:35.249
French fries,

03:35.283 --> 03:36.850
which were actually invented
in Belgium.

03:36.884 --> 03:38.552
Clayton,
when did you get here?

03:38.586 --> 03:40.421
McGEE: I thought you weren't
coming till next week.

03:40.454 --> 03:42.323
What, you knew about this?
Yeah, Gibbs told me.

03:42.356 --> 03:44.292
MI6 Intel Officer

03:44.325 --> 03:46.327
Reeves here,
has been assigned to

03:46.360 --> 03:47.695
NCIS international desk.

03:47.728 --> 03:48.696
Great to see you all again.

03:48.729 --> 03:50.398
TORRES:
Wow.

03:50.431 --> 03:51.399
You're taller
in person.

03:51.432 --> 03:52.866
Thank you.

03:52.900 --> 03:54.535
Yeah, on the MTAC screen,
you're, like...

03:54.568 --> 03:55.569
(squeaks)

03:56.737 --> 03:58.639
That's a nice suit.

03:58.672 --> 03:59.640
You've been on a plane
for nine hours?

03:59.673 --> 04:01.275
I pressed it at the hotel

04:01.309 --> 04:02.610
before I came into the office.

04:02.643 --> 04:03.677
Yes.

04:03.711 --> 04:04.778
Ketchup-prawn are my favorite.

04:04.812 --> 04:05.713
Which is why

04:05.746 --> 04:08.616
I got you...
your own entire case, Ellie.

04:08.649 --> 04:10.518
Oh, be still,

04:10.551 --> 04:13.554
my sodium-starved heart.

04:13.587 --> 04:14.322
Eat 'em in the car.

04:14.355 --> 04:15.889
We got a death threat
in Dahlgren.

04:15.923 --> 04:17.358
BISHOP: Well, if Reeves
is with us,

04:17.391 --> 04:19.460
should we take a third vehicle?
No, not today.

04:19.493 --> 04:21.829
Agent Reeves is here to
assist your team as needed.

04:21.862 --> 04:24.665
But right now, he and I
need to discuss a few things

04:24.698 --> 04:25.999
regarding the transition.

04:26.033 --> 04:27.435
Am I in trouble already?

04:27.468 --> 04:28.702
Welcome to NCIS.

04:30.571 --> 04:32.406
(camera clicking)

04:32.440 --> 04:34.642
(siren whoops)

04:34.675 --> 04:36.710
(indistinct chatter)

04:36.744 --> 04:38.979
And they say
"write your congressman."

04:39.012 --> 04:41.815
Flemming's district is
in Maryland farm country,

04:41.849 --> 04:42.883
but I've heard of her.

04:42.916 --> 04:46.587
Filibustered last year
for veterans' health care

04:46.620 --> 04:48.989
and is on a military
appropriations committee.

04:49.022 --> 04:50.023
She pays our salary?

04:50.057 --> 04:52.760
Well, not exactly, but
from what I understand,

04:52.793 --> 04:55.363
she's one of the good ones.
Everybody likes her.

04:55.396 --> 04:56.997
Not everybody.

04:57.030 --> 04:59.400
Well, the prints on the door
handle are totally unusable.

04:59.433 --> 05:00.368
McGEE:
Base security says that

05:00.401 --> 05:02.336
there is no cameras
or checkpoints out here.

05:02.370 --> 05:04.004
So it could've been anyone
with access to the base.

05:04.037 --> 05:05.639
TORRES:
Our jurisdiction.

05:05.673 --> 05:07.808
It's a shame we can't do more
to catch this guy.

05:07.841 --> 05:09.343
We can and we will.

05:09.377 --> 05:10.544
It's not like we're gonna

05:10.578 --> 05:11.712
autopsy a rat.

05:14.014 --> 05:15.749
No.

05:15.783 --> 05:18.018
NCIS has to take the threat
seriously. If we don't...

05:18.051 --> 05:19.687
They turn into actions.

05:19.720 --> 05:20.854
Damn right.
TORRES: I'm sure
that's one of

05:20.888 --> 05:22.923
your rules, Gibbs,
but the congresswoman

05:22.956 --> 05:24.358
is not taking
this seriously.

05:24.392 --> 05:25.359
She's not even
here to talk.

05:25.393 --> 05:27.127
Uh, she had a 10:00 a.m. meeting
in Georgetown.

05:27.160 --> 05:28.862
Max Sanders,

05:28.896 --> 05:31.465
Congresswoman Flemming's
personal aide.
My point exactly.

05:31.499 --> 05:33.133
Actually, it might be better
that she's not here.

05:33.166 --> 05:36.003
I can finally tell
someone the truth.

05:36.036 --> 05:38.772
Miss Flemming wouldn't
let me go to the FBI.

05:38.806 --> 05:40.541
Go to the FBI? What for?

05:41.575 --> 05:43.511
These threats.

05:43.544 --> 05:44.712
It wasn't the first one?

05:44.745 --> 05:47.781
First dead body, so to speak.

05:47.815 --> 05:49.617
They started as
social media threats,

05:49.650 --> 05:51.552
then phone calls, letters.

05:51.585 --> 05:53.153
Then you start seeing
the same angry faces

05:53.186 --> 05:54.054
at campaign events.

05:54.087 --> 05:56.056
It's escalating.
Enough to keep records.

05:59.993 --> 06:02.129
There's got to be
50 names here, at least.

06:02.162 --> 06:03.731
And those are just
the repeat offenders.

06:03.764 --> 06:05.599
But look, you did not
get that from me.

06:05.633 --> 06:07.067
If my boss finds out...

06:07.100 --> 06:09.537
Where does NCIS get off?

06:09.570 --> 06:11.138
Ten years
on the Hill--

06:11.171 --> 06:13.741
I think I know how to
handle myself and my safety.

06:13.774 --> 06:16.977
If I blow the whistle on a rat,
I look weak.

06:17.010 --> 06:19.680
"Poor scared woman can't
handle the pressure."

06:19.713 --> 06:20.981
Perceptions cost elections.

06:21.014 --> 06:22.583
MAN: Now you see
what you're in for, huh?

06:22.616 --> 06:23.751
Thanks, Frank.

06:23.784 --> 06:25.986
NCIS will be glad
to take the lead.

06:26.019 --> 06:27.888
(door closes)
It will be a pleasure

06:27.921 --> 06:29.657
to work with the congresswoman.

06:30.691 --> 06:31.592
Representative Flemming,

06:31.625 --> 06:32.926
nice to see you again.

06:32.960 --> 06:34.795
Director Vance,
was that the FBI?

06:34.828 --> 06:35.929
Yes.
I assume

06:35.963 --> 06:37.665
your overzealous involvement

06:37.698 --> 06:39.667
has nothing to do
with the appropriations bill

06:39.700 --> 06:42.169
you and the Navy want me
to vote for next month.

06:42.202 --> 06:43.971
Your concern for my welfare
is touching,

06:44.004 --> 06:45.539
but I can't be bought.

06:45.573 --> 06:46.540
You've made that clear

06:46.574 --> 06:48.008
the last three years

06:48.041 --> 06:50.511
that I've presented reports
to your committee.

06:52.112 --> 06:53.481
Jenna Flemming.

06:53.514 --> 06:54.648
U.S. Congress.

06:54.682 --> 06:56.083
Special Agent Gibbs.
Agent Gibbs,

06:56.116 --> 06:57.651
I know you are just trying
to do your job,

06:57.685 --> 06:59.587
but my aide
overstepped his bounds,

06:59.620 --> 07:01.822
reads too much Internet.
These threats

07:01.855 --> 07:03.724
are violent.
With regard to everything

07:03.757 --> 07:05.626
from gun control
to minimum wage,

07:05.659 --> 07:07.060
you've made enemies
on both sides.

07:07.094 --> 07:09.630
Well, if you don't, you
aren't working hard enough.

07:09.663 --> 07:11.198
But someone got close
this time.

07:11.231 --> 07:12.700
They knew where you were.

07:12.733 --> 07:14.034
They got on base.

07:14.067 --> 07:15.769
It took planning
and it took commitment.

07:15.803 --> 07:18.005
I just don't want this
to become a federal case.

07:18.038 --> 07:19.039
It already has.

07:20.040 --> 07:21.909
Director, it's my life.

07:21.942 --> 07:23.711
And we're gonna protect it.

07:27.280 --> 07:28.916
You're welcome.

07:36.156 --> 07:40.027
Representative Jenna Flemming
of Maryland's ninth district.

07:40.060 --> 07:41.662
Started in local politics

07:41.695 --> 07:43.263
when she ran for
school board president.

07:43.296 --> 07:44.898
Was elected to
the state senate

07:44.932 --> 07:47.067
three times before
setting her sights

07:47.100 --> 07:48.836
on the U.S. House
of Representatives.

07:48.869 --> 07:50.704
Oh, she can't sit still,
can't shut up.

07:50.738 --> 07:52.139
Gets things done.

07:52.172 --> 07:53.741
Yeah, why would anyone
want to kill her?

07:53.774 --> 07:55.242
Can't imagine.

07:55.275 --> 07:57.545
We only offered to
walk her to her car;

07:57.578 --> 07:59.079
she practically
tore our heads off.

07:59.112 --> 08:00.748
I'm liking this woman.
BISHOP: Well,
she once voted

08:00.781 --> 08:02.215
in favor of a gun control law

08:02.249 --> 08:05.118
wearing full hunting gear
on the House floor.

08:05.152 --> 08:05.919
In order to?

08:05.953 --> 08:06.820
To show that
the Second Amendment

08:06.854 --> 08:08.956
and reason
are not mutually exclusive.

08:08.989 --> 08:10.123
Sounds like
a political stunt to me.

08:10.157 --> 08:11.024
Or it shows character.

08:11.058 --> 08:12.926
Let's leave politics
out of the office.

08:12.960 --> 08:14.595
Unless it gives us answers.

08:14.628 --> 08:16.597
Who wants our politician dead?

08:16.630 --> 08:18.231
BISHOP: Been narrowing
the list of repeat offenders.

08:18.265 --> 08:19.567
Two names stand out.

08:19.600 --> 08:21.201
QUINN: First one
is Simon Lee.

08:21.234 --> 08:22.803
Creator of
an online message board

08:22.836 --> 08:24.271
dedicated to "exposing

08:24.304 --> 08:26.273
"the true heritage
and ancestry

08:26.306 --> 08:27.675
of elected leaders."

08:27.708 --> 08:29.109
BISHOP:
Claims Congresswoman Flemming

08:29.142 --> 08:31.011
is a descendent of
Attila the Hun,

08:31.044 --> 08:32.813
which she actually is.

08:32.846 --> 08:34.982
Ruthless nationalism
should be a plus to this guy.

08:35.015 --> 08:36.116
Yeah, but he uses it
as an excuse

08:36.149 --> 08:37.985
to get angry
and form protests,

08:38.018 --> 08:39.820
some of which have
gotten really violent.

08:39.853 --> 08:41.154
Except Lee's not
our rat killer.

08:41.188 --> 08:41.955
He was arrested for

08:41.989 --> 08:43.691
stalking a judge--
still in jail.

08:43.724 --> 08:44.958
Next name.
QUINN: All right, uh,

08:44.992 --> 08:47.127
BurnTheWitches1692.

08:47.160 --> 08:49.296
BISHOP: Anonymous username
on the same message board.

08:49.329 --> 08:52.132
Seems to be Lee's right
hand and mouthpiece.

08:52.165 --> 08:55.603
And he wrote a post last week
calling Flemming a "gutless rat"

08:55.636 --> 08:57.838
for not publicly
denouncing the Huns.

08:57.871 --> 08:59.006
The real security threat.
That's it?

08:59.039 --> 09:01.675
Uh, Quinn and I have about
ten more names to dig into.

09:01.709 --> 09:03.243
Then go. Do it.

09:03.276 --> 09:05.613
McGee, track
the witches.

09:06.647 --> 09:07.915
Hey.

09:11.318 --> 09:14.187
Oh, must be working
on something big.

09:14.221 --> 09:15.288
That was fast.

09:17.625 --> 09:18.859
DUCKY:
A skull,

09:18.892 --> 09:21.228
a cloaked figure
wielding a scythe--

09:21.261 --> 09:24.297
all symbols of
impending death.

09:24.331 --> 09:27.067
And as if a dead rat
with a large cut down its center

09:27.100 --> 09:29.169
wasn't clear enough, our culprit

09:29.202 --> 09:31.939
felt the need to literally
spell this one out for us.

09:31.972 --> 09:34.875
Well, the note was tied
around the little fella's neck

09:34.908 --> 09:36.944
with a bosun's knot.

09:36.977 --> 09:37.878
Another symbol?

09:37.911 --> 09:40.914
Or the person who tied it

09:40.948 --> 09:44.985
has training in
marlinspike seamanship.

09:45.018 --> 09:46.053
Rope work?

09:46.086 --> 09:47.120
Yep.

09:47.154 --> 09:48.622
Navy training?

09:48.656 --> 09:50.090
Well, perhaps.

09:50.123 --> 09:54.061
Or maybe just experience
in and around boats.

09:54.094 --> 09:56.964
The congresswoman does have
strong Navy ties

09:56.997 --> 09:58.832
and votes
on the appropriations committee.

09:58.866 --> 10:01.835
So... Navy knot?

10:01.869 --> 10:04.004
Navy threat?

10:04.037 --> 10:08.275
Well, is our friend here
ready for autopsy?

10:08.308 --> 10:09.276
Well...

10:09.309 --> 10:11.244
he came ready.

10:11.278 --> 10:14.114
Oh, the cut
along the abdomen?

10:14.147 --> 10:15.983
Yeah, I don't think
it was the cause of death.

10:16.016 --> 10:19.319
Someone already
did our job for us.

10:19.352 --> 10:20.788
Oh.

10:20.821 --> 10:22.956
Missing all
internal organs.

10:22.990 --> 10:26.226
This is a literal gutless rat.

10:29.963 --> 10:32.265
You are a magician.

10:32.299 --> 10:34.367
Well, uh,
no magic needed.

10:34.401 --> 10:36.103
No, just-- you know,
most people use

10:36.136 --> 10:38.105
the same avatar
on multiple Web sites,

10:38.138 --> 10:40.974
you know, so I just
tracked BurnTheWitches1692

10:41.008 --> 10:43.944
to another site with
more personal details,

10:43.977 --> 10:45.212
and ran into a name:
Amy Barrett.

10:45.245 --> 10:46.313
Internet is
the devil, man.

10:46.346 --> 10:48.682
And, apparently,
so is Miss Barrett.

10:48.716 --> 10:49.983
(tires screech)
Principal says

10:50.017 --> 10:52.319
she's taking an after-school
driver's ed class.

10:54.755 --> 10:56.223
Oh!

10:57.457 --> 11:00.260
Satan takes many forms,
my friend.

11:00.293 --> 11:03.030
Hey, listen, uh, I was gonna

11:03.063 --> 11:05.265
tell you about Reeves
coming in to NCIS.

11:05.298 --> 11:07.367
Sorry if that was
kind of a surprise.

11:07.400 --> 11:09.269
Okay.

11:09.302 --> 11:10.971
I just, you know,
I know what it's like.

11:11.004 --> 11:12.706
Two alpha men trying

11:12.740 --> 11:15.275
to prove their
manhood, you know?

11:17.310 --> 11:19.412
You see right
through me, Tim.
No, I understand.

11:19.446 --> 11:21.248
I mean, I went through the same
thing with Tony, you know.

11:21.281 --> 11:22.282
Right.

11:22.315 --> 11:23.817
Yeah.

11:23.851 --> 11:25.285
(tires screech)

11:25.318 --> 11:27.955
Oh, here comes our car.

11:31.458 --> 11:33.026
Crap.

11:34.327 --> 11:36.229
Fuzz.
What?

11:38.265 --> 11:39.833
(tires screeching)

11:46.439 --> 11:47.440
(tires screech)

11:49.777 --> 11:51.378
Hey, no fair! Take your
foot off the brake!

11:51.411 --> 11:53.313
Take your foot off the pedal.

11:54.514 --> 11:56.016
You okay, sir?

11:56.049 --> 11:58.451
I stare death in the face
every day.

11:58.485 --> 12:00.287
Amy, hands on the wheel.
Ten and two, please.

12:06.193 --> 12:07.928
(clears throat)

12:09.396 --> 12:12.900
Okay, well, heard about
the high-speed getaway.

12:12.933 --> 12:14.935
Uh, what was the next
part of the plan,

12:14.968 --> 12:16.403
take Big Ed hostage?

12:16.436 --> 12:18.105
My daughter's very sorry.

12:18.138 --> 12:20.373
She just wasn't thinking.

12:20.407 --> 12:22.776
What about the threats
to Congresswoman Flemming?

12:22.810 --> 12:24.377
Were you thinking then, Amy?

12:24.411 --> 12:26.113
Wait, what threats?

12:30.050 --> 12:31.384
(gasps)

12:31.418 --> 12:33.186
What did you do?

12:33.220 --> 12:35.856
You were politically active
when you were my age.

12:35.889 --> 12:38.125
I peacefully protested
animal cruelty

12:38.158 --> 12:40.127
in the meat industry.

12:40.160 --> 12:41.428
Hmm.

12:41.461 --> 12:42.796
(gasps)

12:42.830 --> 12:44.531
Amy Lynn Barrett!

12:44.564 --> 12:46.199
I-I didn't do that.
Oh...

12:46.233 --> 12:47.901
QUINN: "The country
is going to hell

12:47.935 --> 12:49.903
"in a handbasket.

12:49.937 --> 12:51.905
"A basket carried
by gutless rats

12:51.939 --> 12:54.441
"fresh off the boat
from some country, not America.

12:54.474 --> 12:56.509
"Someone should sent
Attila the Flemming

12:56.543 --> 12:57.577
a clear message."

12:57.610 --> 13:00.580
It was
an ethnogenesis joke.

13:00.613 --> 13:03.450
If these people knew
anything about world history,

13:03.483 --> 13:05.218
they'd be the first ones
to praise Attila

13:05.252 --> 13:07.220
for his ruthless nationalism.

13:07.254 --> 13:09.189
You're not
helping yourself, Ame.

13:09.222 --> 13:11.524
You're the one who's yelling
at the news every night, Mom.

13:11.558 --> 13:13.827
About how hateful morons
live in the shadows,

13:13.861 --> 13:16.496
easily manipulated
by rhetoric.

13:17.530 --> 13:19.166
I was just proving your point.

13:19.199 --> 13:22.335
Well, your rhetoric may have
inspired someone to act.

13:22.369 --> 13:24.071
Then arrest them.

13:24.104 --> 13:27.240
I'm just shedding light
in great darkness.

13:28.641 --> 13:32.579
Well, so much for
free-range parenting.

13:40.954 --> 13:42.489
Why did you call me
back in here?

13:42.522 --> 13:44.992
I was in the middle of a nice
piece of halibut downtown.

13:45.025 --> 13:48.028
I strongly suggested
you stay indoors,

13:48.061 --> 13:50.998
on government property,
where security was present.

13:51.031 --> 13:53.500
I considered it, but abstained.

13:53.533 --> 13:55.135
You're not making
my job easier.

13:55.168 --> 13:56.269
You're in
an appointed position.

13:56.303 --> 13:57.570
Your job couldn't get easier.

13:57.604 --> 13:59.306
Do you have any idea
how much work

13:59.339 --> 14:01.608
I would get done if I didn't
have to win elections?

14:01.641 --> 14:03.543
(cell phone ringing)

14:03.576 --> 14:05.412
To help us
narrow the list,

14:05.445 --> 14:08.348
I'm gonna need your
cell phone and your laptop.

14:08.381 --> 14:10.117
From my cold, dead hands.

14:10.150 --> 14:11.651
I'm trying to avoid that.

14:11.684 --> 14:13.586
(sighs)

14:16.056 --> 14:17.958
My front door.

14:17.991 --> 14:19.927
You've been to my house?
Not us.

14:19.960 --> 14:21.461
One of the people
on the list.

14:21.494 --> 14:23.363
They posted
the photo online.

14:23.396 --> 14:24.564
There are more, if you want.

14:27.600 --> 14:30.670
If I pay too much attention
to the negative voices,

14:30.703 --> 14:33.040
it gives them power.

14:33.073 --> 14:34.942
You can't ignore them.
Thank you.

14:34.975 --> 14:38.145
Really. But your services
are not needed.

14:38.178 --> 14:40.180
(cell phone ringing)

14:40.213 --> 14:43.516
Oh. Must be you this time.

14:44.551 --> 14:45.452
Yeah, Gibbs.

14:47.520 --> 14:48.488
Brighton, Maryland?

14:48.521 --> 14:51.324
That's in my district.

14:51.358 --> 14:53.393
We'll meet you there.

14:53.426 --> 14:55.628
Thank you for this info.

14:55.662 --> 14:58.065
Hey. Uh, motel owner
I.D.'d the body

14:58.098 --> 14:59.967
as one of the guests:
Max Sanders.

15:00.000 --> 15:01.468
Congresswoman's aide.

15:01.501 --> 15:03.436
All right.

15:12.645 --> 15:15.582
(gasps) Oh, my God.

15:29.729 --> 15:31.331
McGEE: I got a wound
on the head over here.

15:31.364 --> 15:34.001
Doubt it's from
a swimming accident.

15:34.034 --> 15:35.435
Yeah, in December?

15:35.468 --> 15:37.637
Well, Max Sanders lives
in Alexandria.

15:37.670 --> 15:40.307
What's he doing all the way
out here in Brighton, Maryland,

15:40.340 --> 15:41.608
in a motel room?

15:41.641 --> 15:43.210
It's practically
in the middle of nowhere.

15:43.243 --> 15:44.511
Well, it's the
congresswoman's district.

15:44.544 --> 15:46.379
She's pretty upset.

15:46.413 --> 15:48.481
Well, guess it's getting
pretty real now.

15:48.515 --> 15:50.483
Victim's got family
in Wisconsin

15:50.517 --> 15:52.552
and a girlfriend
coming in to NCIS.

15:52.585 --> 15:54.187
Ugh!

15:54.221 --> 15:55.722
You find something?

15:55.755 --> 15:59.492
Yeah, a used condom
and a dead bird.

16:01.428 --> 16:03.363
Think they're related?

16:03.396 --> 16:04.364
To each other?

16:04.397 --> 16:05.532
To the case.

16:05.565 --> 16:09.069
No, but this might be.

16:10.770 --> 16:12.072
Victim's cell phone.

16:14.241 --> 16:15.675
Yeah, I talked to every guest
who would answer the door.

16:15.708 --> 16:17.077
Nobody's willing
to admit they saw

16:17.110 --> 16:18.611
or heard anything unusual.

16:18.645 --> 16:20.313
I have the registry, but...

16:20.347 --> 16:21.714
WOMAN:
Well, I heard something.

16:21.748 --> 16:23.450
Sorry. (chuckles)

16:24.617 --> 16:26.153
I was just getting some ice,

16:26.186 --> 16:27.587
and I couldn't help
but overhear.

16:27.620 --> 16:28.688
You have
information, ma'am?

16:28.721 --> 16:31.091
I heard shouting
between two men.

16:31.124 --> 16:32.725
And I opened
my hotel door,

16:32.759 --> 16:35.562
and I saw a car just take off

16:35.595 --> 16:37.430
out of the parking lot.

16:37.464 --> 16:38.431
Oh...

16:38.465 --> 16:40.333
I'll be right there, Rodney.

16:40.367 --> 16:42.769
Champagne still needs
to chill.

16:42.802 --> 16:44.003
(chuckles)

16:45.638 --> 16:47.507
He's my accountant.

16:50.543 --> 16:53.180
You remember anything
about the car?

16:53.213 --> 16:56.649
Um, red Lincoln,
or maybe a Caddy.

16:56.683 --> 16:57.817
You remember what time it was?

16:57.850 --> 17:01.221
(laughs) I wasn't
paying much attention.

17:01.254 --> 17:04.291
I was in the middle of an audit.

17:05.625 --> 17:06.759
Mm-hmm.

17:17.137 --> 17:18.371
May I help you?

17:18.405 --> 17:20.507
Just passing through.

17:20.540 --> 17:22.642
I meant with the case.

17:22.675 --> 17:24.611
Director Vance
was done with me,

17:24.644 --> 17:26.546
asked me to check in
with "Team Gibbs."

17:26.579 --> 17:28.215
Is he still with
the congresswoman?

17:28.248 --> 17:30.183
The director's taking
a personal interest.
Oh, well,

17:30.217 --> 17:32.252
Flemming votes
on Navy funding, so...

17:32.285 --> 17:33.753
I'm getting a sense
it's something else.

17:33.786 --> 17:35.088
Mm.

17:35.122 --> 17:36.489
So, what do you know?

17:36.523 --> 17:37.857
Max Sanders' motel room
was clean.

17:37.890 --> 17:40.260
No blood, no murder weapon...

17:40.293 --> 17:41.194
No help.

17:41.228 --> 17:42.229
Well, records show
that the victim has been

17:42.262 --> 17:45.232
staying at the motel
on and off for the past month.

17:45.265 --> 17:47.200
Job-related?
Good question.

17:47.234 --> 17:48.368
And I can answer it.

17:52.572 --> 17:55.175
LAURIE: Yeah, Max and I had been
dating for a few weeks,

17:55.208 --> 17:57.510
but there was
something there.

17:57.544 --> 18:00.613
He was a great guy.

18:00.647 --> 18:03.616
Funny, if a little fastidious.

18:03.650 --> 18:07.320
His word,
but I call it "picky."

18:07.354 --> 18:11.691
Food, clothing, hygiene.

18:11.724 --> 18:13.560
He was supposed
to meet me for lunch,

18:13.593 --> 18:15.695
but he didn't show up.

18:15.728 --> 18:17.597
And he didn't
return my texts.

18:17.630 --> 18:20.233
I was finishing up
with an open house

18:20.267 --> 18:22.335
when I got the call
from NCIS.

18:22.369 --> 18:24.571
So you're a real estate agent?
Yeah.

18:24.604 --> 18:27.807
Did Max have any, uh, problems
or talk about any enemies?

18:30.377 --> 18:32.312
Yeah.

18:32.345 --> 18:33.513
His boss.

18:35.582 --> 18:38.151
You think the congresswoman
had something to do with this?

18:38.185 --> 18:40.687
I-I don't know,

18:40.720 --> 18:44.224
but she had him
working on a secret project.

18:46.193 --> 18:47.794
Do you think
that's what got him killed?

18:47.827 --> 18:49.696
Wh-What kind of secret project?

18:49.729 --> 18:52.599
I don't know.
I don't know the details.

18:52.632 --> 18:55.635
But you'd have to ask
Miss Flemming.

18:55.668 --> 18:57.937
FLEMMING: People get nervous
when you talk

18:57.970 --> 19:00.273
about base closures.

19:00.307 --> 19:03.810
Closing a base disrupts
a lot of lives,

19:03.843 --> 19:05.778
military and civilian.

19:05.812 --> 19:08.315
The relationship
between a military base

19:08.348 --> 19:10.717
and the town it borders
is significant.

19:10.750 --> 19:12.519
For the town,
it's economic.

19:12.552 --> 19:14.721
For the Navy,
it's morale.

19:14.754 --> 19:18.691
A tie to normal life,
a place to call home.

19:18.725 --> 19:22.529
It's one of the hardest
things I have to do.

19:22.562 --> 19:24.697
So you research.

19:24.731 --> 19:26.333
Yes.

19:26.366 --> 19:28.735
And then we research more.

19:28.768 --> 19:31.338
Hmm.

19:31.371 --> 19:32.839
That's what Max was
working on.

19:32.872 --> 19:35.308
Brighton Naval Base.

19:35.342 --> 19:37.277
Closing it would make
a lot of people angry.

19:37.310 --> 19:39.379
But the fact that it was
even up for consideration

19:39.412 --> 19:40.680
was never made public.

19:40.713 --> 19:42.682
Which way was it leaning?

19:42.715 --> 19:44.917
It's become clear
the base is less vital.

19:44.951 --> 19:47.687
Despite the fact that
it's in my district,

19:47.720 --> 19:48.788
I have to advocate closure.

19:51.758 --> 19:53.726
Weighing facts
over political fallout.

19:55.328 --> 19:56.929
You are the last
of a rare breed.

19:56.963 --> 19:58.465
(chuckles softly)

19:58.498 --> 20:00.233
Yeah, the dodos.

20:01.901 --> 20:03.703
Someone apparently found out.

20:03.736 --> 20:09.342
Max knew not to say
what he was really working on.

20:09.376 --> 20:12.512
He was always smarter than me.

20:12.545 --> 20:15.248
I didn't win those elections,
we did.

20:20.420 --> 20:22.755
I never told him that.

20:22.789 --> 20:23.523
Jenna...

20:25.758 --> 20:27.660
I don't expect you
to understand

20:27.694 --> 20:31.531
the battles we fight
on a daily basis

20:31.564 --> 20:33.666
or the personal
sacrifices.

20:33.700 --> 20:36.403
If Max was doing research,
he would have had a source.

20:38.638 --> 20:40.607
Who's the last person
he spoke with?

20:40.640 --> 20:42.675
Jed Hamilton.

20:42.709 --> 20:46.012
He owns a few businesses
and knows everyone in Brighton.

20:46.045 --> 20:47.880
He's the de facto mayor.

20:47.914 --> 20:49.716
Thank you.

20:49.749 --> 20:52.785
And I am going to arrange for
an overnight security detail.

20:52.819 --> 20:55.555
That's unfortunate.

21:03.830 --> 21:04.731
BISHOP:
Morning, Gibbs.

21:04.764 --> 21:05.932
Ellie.

21:05.965 --> 21:08.335
So I did some digging into
the name Director Vance gave us.

21:08.368 --> 21:09.602
Jed Hamilton.
Mm-hmm.

21:09.636 --> 21:10.703
Married.

21:10.737 --> 21:11.771
No kids.

21:11.804 --> 21:13.673
The town's mayor
and biggest champion.

21:13.706 --> 21:15.308
Everything Flemming says
checks out.

21:15.342 --> 21:16.509
Except?
No exception.

21:16.543 --> 21:17.810
Just an addition.

21:17.844 --> 21:20.547
Jed Hamilton
drives a red Cadillac.

21:20.580 --> 21:21.681
Could be the car

21:21.714 --> 21:22.782
seen at the motel.

21:22.815 --> 21:23.983
Bring him in.

21:24.016 --> 21:25.318
On it.

21:25.352 --> 21:26.386
(elevator bell dings)

21:28.955 --> 21:29.922
Duck?

21:29.956 --> 21:30.923
Jethro.

21:30.957 --> 21:32.792
Jimmy.

21:32.825 --> 21:33.793
What do we got?

21:33.826 --> 21:35.562
Max Sanders--

21:35.595 --> 21:37.464
treated his body as a temple.

21:37.497 --> 21:39.532
He had regular meals,
regular exercise--

21:39.566 --> 21:41.033
a man after my own heart.

21:41.067 --> 21:42.902
Lots of Self Love.

21:44.371 --> 21:45.905
That's a protein bar

21:45.938 --> 21:47.707
that was actually
his last meal.

21:47.740 --> 21:49.876
Self Love Peanut
Butter Blitz.

21:49.909 --> 21:50.910
Not my favorite.

21:50.943 --> 21:52.779
I actually much prefer...

21:52.812 --> 21:54.747
that-that you never look
at me like that again.

21:54.781 --> 21:55.782
Then tell me why's he dead.

21:55.815 --> 22:00.653
It was not the blunt-force
trauma to the head.

22:00.687 --> 22:03.556
While it was hardy enough to
fracture the parietal bone,

22:03.590 --> 22:04.824
it was not fatal.

22:04.857 --> 22:06.092
Hell of a headache.
Yeah, well,

22:06.125 --> 22:08.428
he would've suffered
severe disorientation

22:08.461 --> 22:09.662
and confusion.

22:09.696 --> 22:11.731
As a result,
he may not have realized

22:11.764 --> 22:13.032
the extent of the damage.

22:13.065 --> 22:14.934
Maybe he tried
to walk it off.

22:14.967 --> 22:17.504
And he walked into a pool?

22:17.537 --> 22:18.905
His lungs were
filled with water,

22:18.938 --> 22:20.640
so he was alive when
he took the dive.

22:20.673 --> 22:23.443
Already dizzy, he-he panicked.

22:23.476 --> 22:25.044
With every breath,
he sucked in water

22:25.077 --> 22:26.813
instead of air and drowned.

22:26.846 --> 22:29.081
So it was an
accidental death...

22:29.115 --> 22:30.417
kind of.

22:30.450 --> 22:31.451
You got a time?

22:31.484 --> 22:32.819
Well, oddly enough,

22:32.852 --> 22:36.923
the blow to the head
occurred one hour before death.

22:40.126 --> 22:42.128
(door creaks)
Federal agents.

22:42.161 --> 22:43.763
(dog barking in distance)

22:43.796 --> 22:45.398
Mr. Hamilton?

22:50.570 --> 22:51.971
House is empty.

22:52.004 --> 22:54.574
Wife's in Martha's Vineyard
with family.

22:54.607 --> 22:57.176
(sighs) It's BOLO time
for Mr. Town Mayor

22:57.209 --> 22:59.812
and his, uh, red Cadillac.

22:59.846 --> 23:01.814
Already on it.
Okay,

23:01.848 --> 23:04.817
now this is a kind of boat
you can get out of a basement.

23:04.851 --> 23:06.853
Gibbs should take notes.

23:08.488 --> 23:09.456
Ooh.

23:09.489 --> 23:11.157
Gibbs should not take notes.

23:11.190 --> 23:12.725
Hmm.

23:12.759 --> 23:14.927
I think I went to high school
with that girl.

23:14.961 --> 23:15.995
Good for her.

23:16.028 --> 23:17.764
(phone chimes)
Hmm.

23:17.797 --> 23:19.165
Oh. McGee wants to know

23:19.198 --> 23:21.701
if there's anything else
to add to the BOLO.

23:21.734 --> 23:24.804
How about this guy's fetish
for boats and bikinis?

23:27.940 --> 23:29.175
Oh!

23:29.208 --> 23:30.910
And rats.

23:30.943 --> 23:31.911
Plural?

23:31.944 --> 23:33.412
(groans)
Where there's one...

23:34.647 --> 23:37.049
Looks like one's missing.

23:37.083 --> 23:38.851
(groans)

23:50.029 --> 23:53.466
ABBY: So, the blood work shows
that the rats from the freezer

23:53.500 --> 23:56.202
match the rat from
Congresswoman Flemming's car.

23:56.235 --> 23:57.904
All courtesy of Jed Hamilton.

23:57.937 --> 23:59.038
Brighton town father.

23:59.071 --> 24:00.172
And who's still missing.

24:00.206 --> 24:01.808
His car was spotted
fleeing the motel

24:01.841 --> 24:03.510
where the congresswoman's
aide was murdered.

24:03.543 --> 24:04.911
Max Sanders.

24:05.945 --> 24:07.680
(ice clattering)

24:07.714 --> 24:10.249
32, only child,
Madison, Wisconsin.

24:10.282 --> 24:12.485
Graduated from
Northwestern Law,

24:12.519 --> 24:13.853
'07.

24:13.886 --> 24:15.488
Started working for
Flemming in '09.

24:15.522 --> 24:16.856
I also read the case file.

24:16.889 --> 24:18.190
Um, so Clayton
just stopped by

24:18.224 --> 24:20.092
to say hi, so I was
giving him a rundown.

24:20.126 --> 24:22.194
Oh, I thought
that's why you called me.

24:22.228 --> 24:24.531
I didn't mean to step
on any toes, pal.

24:24.564 --> 24:25.565
Keep your shirt on.

24:25.598 --> 24:26.699
A shirt you clearly slept in.

24:26.733 --> 24:28.568
Oh, that's because it's so soft.

24:28.601 --> 24:29.836
Is that the same suit
as yesterday?

24:29.869 --> 24:32.672
Okay, so,
moving on.

24:32.705 --> 24:34.240
These rats should be covered
in an American flag.

24:34.273 --> 24:35.542
Why?

24:35.575 --> 24:36.776
Because they're Navy rats.

24:36.809 --> 24:38.611
Officers or enlisted?

24:38.645 --> 24:39.245
(forced laugh)

24:41.714 --> 24:43.282
All their internal
organs are missing,

24:43.315 --> 24:45.585
but it appears they
died of natural causes.

24:45.618 --> 24:46.853
Blood work shows

24:46.886 --> 24:49.756
very high levels
of a protein called IL-33.

24:49.789 --> 24:51.524
What is that?
It's a protein

24:51.558 --> 24:52.992
that's being lab tested

24:53.025 --> 24:54.293
in the treatment
of Alzheimer's patients.

24:54.326 --> 24:55.962
At a Navy lab?

24:55.995 --> 25:00.199
The only lab recently engaging
in such studies

25:00.232 --> 25:04.537
is the John G. Roeper Lab
on Brighton Naval Base.

25:04.571 --> 25:05.938
Yeah, that's the base
up for closure.

25:05.972 --> 25:07.640
Good work, Abby.

25:11.578 --> 25:13.980
Drink mine. Mine is
30 seconds fresher.

25:23.690 --> 25:24.657
(intercom buzzes)

25:24.691 --> 25:26.325
NCIS.

25:26.358 --> 25:28.728
Abby said we're looking
for Carlton Laymer.

25:28.761 --> 25:30.196
H-He runs the lab.

25:30.229 --> 25:32.565
There gonna be a problem
between you and Reeves?

25:32.599 --> 25:34.233
What? (chuckles)

25:34.266 --> 25:36.202
(chuckles)

25:36.235 --> 25:38.004
D-Did Abby call you?

25:38.037 --> 25:41.608
Come on, man. I was just
being funny and charming.

25:41.641 --> 25:42.709
Hmm.
You know.

25:42.742 --> 25:44.343
Funny.

25:44.376 --> 25:46.913
Federal agents!

25:52.151 --> 25:55.588
This is exactly how
a zombie movie starts.

25:55.622 --> 25:57.023
Where are the
scientists?

26:00.660 --> 26:03.195
I don't like this.

26:04.263 --> 26:06.666
(upbeat pop music playing)

26:06.699 --> 26:08.000
* Can you feel me now?

26:08.034 --> 26:09.235
NCIS.

26:09.268 --> 26:11.170
I thought it was
sanitation services

26:11.203 --> 26:12.605
messing with me.

26:12.639 --> 26:13.673
Where's everybody?

26:13.706 --> 26:14.607
Lunch?

26:14.641 --> 26:16.743
* Can you feel me now?

26:16.776 --> 26:18.611
CARLTON:
Our study ended last month.

26:18.645 --> 26:20.079
Navy personnel were transferred.

26:20.112 --> 26:22.314
Civilians were let go.
Except you.

26:22.348 --> 26:24.150
Someone has to finish
with the reports.

26:24.183 --> 26:25.251
And the subjects.

26:25.284 --> 26:27.119
The rats?
As they pass away

26:27.153 --> 26:28.688
from natural causes,

26:28.721 --> 26:31.090
I remove and catalog
the organs for future study.

26:31.123 --> 26:33.693
We applied for a continuation,
but the funds were denied.

26:33.726 --> 26:35.962
Truth be told,
there are bigger labs

26:35.995 --> 26:37.964
that are better equipped.
You don't sound upset.

26:37.997 --> 26:39.766
Part of the job.

26:39.799 --> 26:41.100
Why?

26:41.133 --> 26:43.069
Well, someone didn't
take it so well.

26:45.371 --> 26:47.606
They came from this lab.

26:49.141 --> 26:51.177
TORRES:
And there aren't

26:51.210 --> 26:54.747
many other people here
to, uh, blame for a murder.

26:54.781 --> 26:56.382
No, no, no. (chuckles)

26:56.415 --> 26:57.650
This wasn't me.

26:59.418 --> 27:01.353
And it wasn't Jed.
Jed Hamilton?

27:01.387 --> 27:02.722
Small base, small town.

27:02.755 --> 27:04.390
We go bowling
every now and then.

27:04.423 --> 27:06.058
He owns the bar next door.

27:06.092 --> 27:07.660
I had mentioned to him

27:07.694 --> 27:09.696
that our continuation funds
had been denied.

27:09.729 --> 27:11.764
And he took that
as a bad sign?
Yeah.

27:11.798 --> 27:13.399
Especially since
some congressional aide

27:13.432 --> 27:15.434
had been asking him questions.

27:15.467 --> 27:17.436
He put two and two
together.

27:17.469 --> 27:18.871
Jed was angry.

27:18.905 --> 27:21.207
H-He said he wanted
to send a message.

27:21.240 --> 27:22.241
So you gave him dead rats?

27:22.274 --> 27:24.410
One bag.

27:24.443 --> 27:28.280
When the mayor asks for rats,
you give him rats.

27:28.314 --> 27:30.182
I didn't think
he'd actually do it.

27:32.418 --> 27:33.452
QUINN:
Still no sign

27:33.485 --> 27:34.887
of Jed Hamilton. BOLO's out

27:34.921 --> 27:36.455
on all transportation hubs.

27:36.488 --> 27:37.790
If he's running,
we'll know.

27:37.824 --> 27:38.725
McGEE:
Abby's trying to revive

27:38.758 --> 27:40.259
Max Sanders'
watery cell phone,

27:40.292 --> 27:42.361
but we found his laptop
in the motel room.

27:42.394 --> 27:44.196
Files?
Intact, including all of Max's

27:44.230 --> 27:45.732
research on the town and base.

27:45.765 --> 27:46.833
Look at this, boss.

27:46.866 --> 27:49.802
Beltway Burgers just opened
a franchise in Brighton.

27:49.836 --> 27:51.470
Also, a new fitness
center is going in.

27:51.503 --> 27:52.905
QUINN:
Everything was looking up.

27:52.939 --> 27:54.707
For both the town
and Mr. Hamilton.

27:54.741 --> 27:55.708
Keep digging.

27:58.177 --> 28:00.146
Um... question.

28:00.179 --> 28:01.247
Why, do you got
something to add?

28:01.280 --> 28:02.915
Uh, not about the case.

28:03.950 --> 28:05.484
Is, uh, Reeves
here to work on

28:05.517 --> 28:07.119
Operation Willoughby?

28:10.222 --> 28:12.725
Operation got delayed
six months ago

28:12.759 --> 28:15.762
because the Navy came to
FLETC looking for recruits.

28:15.795 --> 28:17.029
(elevator bell dings)

28:18.765 --> 28:20.833
But no one was
willing to sign up.
Yeah.

28:20.867 --> 28:22.935
Until now.

28:22.969 --> 28:24.804
(elevator bell dings)

28:32.544 --> 28:36.515
I finally connected
with Max's parents.

28:36.548 --> 28:40.753
I said before that your
job was easier, but...

28:40.787 --> 28:42.922
I never stopped
to consider that

28:42.955 --> 28:45.724
you make those kind of
calls on a regular basis.

28:46.993 --> 28:49.061
Well, it comes with the chair.

28:53.065 --> 28:56.302
I also said you don't
understand personal sacrifice.

28:59.238 --> 29:01.407
I wasn't thinking
about your wife.

29:02.875 --> 29:05.011
Well, it's been
a few years ago now.

29:06.012 --> 29:08.514
I'm sorry.

29:08.547 --> 29:10.349
I made a mistake.

29:12.318 --> 29:14.220
You want to know

29:14.253 --> 29:16.522
a little Beltway secret?

29:16.555 --> 29:17.824
Hmm?

29:17.857 --> 29:20.326
You're well liked
on the Hill.

29:20.359 --> 29:22.829
In your addresses
to the committee,

29:22.862 --> 29:24.296
you say what you mean.

29:24.330 --> 29:26.833
Am I being sweet-talked?

29:26.866 --> 29:28.534
About my security detail...

29:28.567 --> 29:29.568
It stays.

29:29.601 --> 29:31.237
Uh, I'd hope so.

29:31.270 --> 29:34.373
But would you please
give me people I can talk to?

29:34.406 --> 29:36.809
You didn't like
Agents Prescott and Friedkin?

29:36.843 --> 29:40.046
Is "mouth-breathers"
too harsh?

29:45.517 --> 29:46.552
Damn euros.

29:46.585 --> 29:48.888
Here, let me get
that for you, man.

29:51.123 --> 29:52.291
(item drops)

29:55.895 --> 29:57.897
Cheers.

29:57.930 --> 29:59.899
Hey, uh,

29:59.932 --> 30:01.901
we have been just messing
with each other, right?

30:01.934 --> 30:04.503
Part of our charming
repartee, yeah.
Right.

30:04.536 --> 30:05.905
Right, so why does
everybody think

30:05.938 --> 30:06.939
we're gonna fight
or something?

30:06.973 --> 30:08.340
(exhales)
Can't two

30:08.374 --> 30:09.842
physical specimens
be in the same room?

30:09.876 --> 30:11.010
I know.
Yeah.

30:11.043 --> 30:12.011
It's ridiculous.

30:12.044 --> 30:12.979
It's ridiculous.

30:15.047 --> 30:16.849
But we are gonna fight one day.

30:16.883 --> 30:18.550
We have to. I mean,
to see who's better.

30:18.584 --> 30:20.352
Of course. Right.
Of course.

30:20.386 --> 30:22.955
VANCE:
Agents Torres and Reeves.

30:22.989 --> 30:25.091
When you two physical
specimens are done,

30:25.124 --> 30:26.558
I have a job for you.

30:33.632 --> 30:36.936
Airline said my luggage
was rerouted to Amsterdam,

30:36.969 --> 30:38.470
but should be here
in a few days.

30:38.504 --> 30:40.106
So that is the suit
from yesterday?

30:40.139 --> 30:42.441
(siren wailing, dog barking
in distance)

30:42.474 --> 30:44.476
You're the only one who noticed.

30:44.510 --> 30:45.978
(chuckles)

30:46.012 --> 30:47.446
It's all good, man.
It's all good.

30:47.479 --> 30:48.647
I totally understand.

30:48.680 --> 30:50.449
And, uh, if you
need anything,

30:50.482 --> 30:53.485
like clothes or
anything like that,

30:53.519 --> 30:54.887
I got your back.

30:56.055 --> 30:57.056
Hey, uh,

30:57.089 --> 30:58.390
how much you bench, man?

30:58.424 --> 31:00.159
(Flemming clears throat)

31:00.192 --> 31:01.660
Gentlemen...

31:01.693 --> 31:03.495
can I go home now?

31:07.967 --> 31:08.935
(car door closes)

31:08.968 --> 31:10.336
Hold up, Nick.

31:11.570 --> 31:13.239
Mayor's red Cadillac.

31:13.272 --> 31:15.407
(pounding on door)
(slurring): Congresswoman!

31:15.441 --> 31:17.443
It's Jed Hamilton.

31:18.978 --> 31:21.180
Are you expecting visitors?

31:21.213 --> 31:23.015
HAMILTON:
We got to talk!
No.

31:23.049 --> 31:24.183
HAMILTON:
Hey!

31:24.216 --> 31:25.918
Get back in the car.

31:25.952 --> 31:27.286
You hear me?

31:28.520 --> 31:30.089
Open up!

31:31.623 --> 31:33.960
Open up!

31:36.395 --> 31:37.396
Hi.

31:39.131 --> 31:40.199
How can I help you?

31:40.232 --> 31:42.969
NCIS.

31:43.002 --> 31:45.938
You been drinking a little bit
tonight, Mr. Hamilton?

31:45.972 --> 31:47.974
Drinking a lot.

31:49.475 --> 31:54.013
And... I'm thinking, too.

31:54.046 --> 31:55.414
Dangerous combination.

31:55.447 --> 31:57.016
Please, put your hands up.

31:57.049 --> 31:59.451
(scoffs)

31:59.485 --> 32:00.486
Wait, wait, wait.

32:03.355 --> 32:05.357
Hey! (grunts)

32:08.360 --> 32:10.997
Come here.
(groaning)

32:14.566 --> 32:16.468
Just a note.

32:16.502 --> 32:17.970
Nice move, mate.

32:18.004 --> 32:21.007
Can't do that in a suit.

32:27.046 --> 32:29.215
I am...

32:29.248 --> 32:30.482
I'm so sorry.

32:30.516 --> 32:32.985
Yep, you say that
in your note.

32:33.019 --> 32:35.321
Uh, I think.
It's kind of sloppy.

32:35.354 --> 32:36.755
Come to finish what you started?

32:36.788 --> 32:39.358
No, I-I just...

32:39.391 --> 32:42.561
Just like the note says,
I went to apologize for the rat.

32:42.594 --> 32:43.762
And for killing
Max Sanders?

32:43.795 --> 32:46.098
No.

32:46.132 --> 32:47.066
Wait,

32:47.099 --> 32:49.235
is this about the motel?

32:49.268 --> 32:52.571
Look, I-I only went
to talk to him.

32:52.604 --> 32:55.641
I mean, the bastard lied about
what he was doing in my town!

32:55.674 --> 32:58.544
I just wanted
to hear the truth.
So do we.

32:58.577 --> 33:01.547
The base is
on the chopping block.

33:01.580 --> 33:03.782
You have any idea
what a base closure can do

33:03.815 --> 33:05.451
to a small town like Brighton?

33:05.484 --> 33:06.652
It-it's a...

33:06.685 --> 33:08.420
it's a symbiotic relationship.

33:08.454 --> 33:10.222
When one dies,
so does the other.

33:10.256 --> 33:12.491
Ever black out when
you drink, Mr. Hamilton?

33:12.524 --> 33:15.494
Lose track of time
or what you've done?

33:17.496 --> 33:18.664
No.

33:18.697 --> 33:21.400
Look, I may have
been drunk,

33:21.433 --> 33:24.436
but I'm sure he was alive
when I left.

33:24.470 --> 33:25.504
But you did hit him.

33:25.537 --> 33:27.739
(cell phone chimes)

33:42.121 --> 33:43.655
Nice way around the rules.

33:43.689 --> 33:45.657
You remember the posters
in Jed's garage?

33:45.691 --> 33:49.095
Turns out he likes
the real thing, too.

33:49.128 --> 33:51.830
Left his driver's license
at a strip club

33:51.863 --> 33:54.833
called Below Deck,
just outside the Navy base.

33:54.866 --> 33:56.568
Symbiotic relationship.

33:56.602 --> 33:58.337
Dancer found it
between the cushions

33:58.370 --> 34:00.139
in the VIP lounge.

34:00.172 --> 34:02.541
She confirmed Jed was there
during the time of the attack.

34:02.574 --> 34:03.809
So he's a pervy?
Yes.

34:03.842 --> 34:06.478
And a drunk, but not our killer.

34:17.323 --> 34:19.825
FBI is downstairs
to arrest Jed Hamilton,

34:19.858 --> 34:21.760
pending criminal-threat charges.

34:21.793 --> 34:23.295
That solves the rat,
but not the murder.

34:23.329 --> 34:26.165
It's way too early
to be back at square one.

34:26.198 --> 34:27.466
Couldn't agree more.

34:27.499 --> 34:29.235
Boss, we kept digging
into those who specifically

34:29.268 --> 34:31.203
stood to lose the most
if the base closes.

34:31.237 --> 34:32.538
Other than
Jed Hamilton?

34:32.571 --> 34:34.306
The biggest deal
on the books is

34:34.340 --> 34:36.242
Drax Commercial
Properties.

34:36.275 --> 34:37.576
BISHOP: They build apartments
and housing developments.

34:37.609 --> 34:39.378
Including a $40 million
subdivision

34:39.411 --> 34:41.113
that's supposed to go up
in Brighton.

34:41.147 --> 34:43.349
These are escrow statements.
Deal hasn't closed yet.

34:43.382 --> 34:44.883
Meaning Drax can
get the money back.

34:44.916 --> 34:46.818
No houses have been built,
so there's no loss.

34:46.852 --> 34:48.320
A deal that big,
somebody had to lose something.

34:48.354 --> 34:50.256
Who's selling the land?
Nobody, boss.

34:50.289 --> 34:51.523
Looked into that.
Owned by the city.

34:51.557 --> 34:53.125
I'm talking about
the sales agent.

34:55.794 --> 34:59.198
QUINN: Well, the real estate
agent who brokered the deal

34:59.231 --> 35:00.866
stands to lose
a hefty commission.

35:00.899 --> 35:02.668
McGEE: It wasn't just
commission on the land.

35:02.701 --> 35:05.271
Local real estate company
negotiated exclusive rights

35:05.304 --> 35:07.139
to all the new housing sales.

35:07.173 --> 35:10.409
I mean, it's two and a half
percent of $40 million.

35:10.442 --> 35:13.212
A lot of motive.
Boss, company is
owned by Laurie Perkins.

35:13.245 --> 35:15.147
QUINN:
The girlfriend.

35:15.181 --> 35:17.249
But we don't have anything
tying her to the murder.

35:18.717 --> 35:20.452
Where is she now?

35:20.486 --> 35:23.389
TORRES:
I like your other place better.

35:23.422 --> 35:24.590
Why are we here?

35:24.623 --> 35:26.558
I just want to pay
my condolences.

35:26.592 --> 35:28.294
All right, five minutes.

35:28.327 --> 35:31.563
Or you can take
as long as you like.

35:36.502 --> 35:38.637
Well, Congresswoman Flemming.

35:38.670 --> 35:40.306
I had no idea you were coming.

35:40.339 --> 35:42.341
A last-minute stop,
Miss Perkins.

35:42.374 --> 35:43.509
Can we have a moment?

35:43.542 --> 35:45.177
TORRES:
Uh, sure.

35:45.211 --> 35:47.479
Only because I smell
fresh cookies.

35:47.513 --> 35:49.248
Oh, freshly baked
in a newly renovated kitchen.

35:49.281 --> 35:50.449
Boom.
Mm-hmm.

35:50.482 --> 35:52.451
(clock chiming)

35:56.388 --> 35:58.324
Well, after everything
that's happened,

35:58.357 --> 36:00.659
it is so nice to see
a friendly face.

36:00.692 --> 36:02.361
Mm, of course.

36:02.394 --> 36:04.396
But I'm not going to be one.

36:05.431 --> 36:06.898
Max and I were good friends.

36:06.932 --> 36:08.867
We talked a lot.

36:08.900 --> 36:10.369
He told me
he'd been seeing someone

36:10.402 --> 36:12.904
that he met during
his research at Brighton.

36:12.938 --> 36:14.873
Miss Flemming, that was...
I didn't make
anything of it

36:14.906 --> 36:17.909
until I checked my schedule
for next week.

36:17.943 --> 36:20.479
Max had me attending
a ground-breaking

36:20.512 --> 36:22.381
at that new housing development.

36:22.414 --> 36:23.749
I checked.

36:23.782 --> 36:25.917
That's your baby.
Yeah.

36:25.951 --> 36:27.586
So what are you saying?

36:27.619 --> 36:30.922
I always say what I mean.

36:30.956 --> 36:32.624
Did you kill Max?

36:33.859 --> 36:36.462
I think you should
leave right now.

36:36.495 --> 36:37.696
You didn't answer the question.

36:40.466 --> 36:42.334
NCIS.

36:43.802 --> 36:45.471
FLEMMING:
Agent Gibbs.

36:45.504 --> 36:47.573
What a surprise.
Yes. Likewise.

36:47.606 --> 36:49.508
Since you're here,
why don't you arrest this woman.

36:49.541 --> 36:51.343
Wait, what the hell
is going on right now?

36:51.377 --> 36:53.545
Yeah, good question.

37:00.586 --> 37:02.954
What the hell
were you thinking?

37:02.988 --> 37:05.657
That Laurie Perkins
killed Max.

37:05.691 --> 37:06.525
So you confronted her yourself?

37:06.558 --> 37:08.594
I was tired of sitting
in orange rooms.

37:08.627 --> 37:09.995
Let us do our job.

37:10.028 --> 37:12.631
I was trying to get her to talk.

37:12.664 --> 37:14.700
And then she went for her bag.
What was inside?

37:14.733 --> 37:16.602
There was no weapon.
There was a phone.

37:16.635 --> 37:18.804
VANCE: We have nothing to tie
this woman to the murder.

37:18.837 --> 37:20.939
Nothing at all except motive.

37:20.972 --> 37:22.708
And normally we would
use that as leverage

37:22.741 --> 37:24.476
to blindside her
in interrogation.

37:24.510 --> 37:26.378
Now we can't.
You have played

37:26.412 --> 37:27.579
our only card!

37:29.848 --> 37:31.317
(typing)

37:31.350 --> 37:32.851
Abby...
Don't ask!

37:32.884 --> 37:35.020
Do you have anything to tie
Laurie Perkins in to the murder?

37:35.053 --> 37:36.555
No, and I'm running out
of places to look.

37:36.588 --> 37:38.390
There's nothing
from the motel room,

37:38.424 --> 37:40.058
there's nothing from the pool,
except for the victim's phone.

37:40.091 --> 37:41.927
You get it working?
Yes, but there's
no texts, no e-mails,

37:41.960 --> 37:43.061
nothing that'll help.

37:43.094 --> 37:45.063
Okay, what about GPS
or biometrics?

37:45.096 --> 37:46.064
Wait.

37:46.097 --> 37:48.066
What?

37:48.099 --> 37:49.401
What's "Self Love"?

37:52.771 --> 37:55.474
(over speaker): I told you,
I was at lunch waiting for Max.

37:55.507 --> 37:56.608
QUINN:
And what time was that again?

37:56.642 --> 37:58.744
I don't remember.

37:58.777 --> 38:00.045
Is that a crime?

38:00.078 --> 38:01.580
(exhales)

38:01.613 --> 38:03.615
I'm sorry, Director.

38:05.784 --> 38:08.320
Agent Gibbs...
(door opens)

38:09.488 --> 38:11.357
210 calories,

38:11.390 --> 38:13.659
20 grams of protein
and nine carbs.

38:13.692 --> 38:15.761
What, Abbs?

38:15.794 --> 38:19.064
It's the nutritional data
for a Self Love protein bar.

38:19.097 --> 38:20.832
I got the
information off

38:20.866 --> 38:22.434
Kalorie Kapture.

38:22.468 --> 38:24.069
Okay, you're gonna have
to explain that.

38:24.102 --> 38:25.571
It's an app
where you take pictures

38:25.604 --> 38:28.106
of your food to keep
track of your diet.

38:28.139 --> 38:30.476
By taking a picture
of his last meal,

38:30.509 --> 38:33.779
our victim solved
his own murder.

38:35.581 --> 38:36.682
Look closer.

38:50.862 --> 38:53.565
GIBBS: Those are your fingers.
Nice nail color.

38:53.599 --> 38:55.601
What is that, Sassy Clown

38:55.634 --> 38:56.902
or Blushing Rooster?

38:56.935 --> 38:58.404
GIBBS:
Check the time stamp.

38:58.437 --> 38:59.671
It's 1:05 p.m.

38:59.705 --> 39:01.673
That's his lunch.
You held it up for him.

39:01.707 --> 39:03.542
You were at the motel
at the time of the attack.

39:03.575 --> 39:05.544
You overheard the mayor
arguing with Max

39:05.577 --> 39:06.845
about the base closing.

39:06.878 --> 39:07.946
It's the first
you ever heard about it.

39:07.979 --> 39:08.914
QUINN:
So, you confronted him

39:08.947 --> 39:10.682
and you tried to get Max
to change his mind.

39:10.716 --> 39:12.083
Max wouldn't do that, would he?

39:12.117 --> 39:14.386
It was an accident. Okay?

39:14.420 --> 39:16.855
I hit him, but-but he was okay.

39:16.888 --> 39:18.356
He walked away.

39:21.593 --> 39:23.529
I want a lawyer.

39:23.562 --> 39:24.730
Now.

39:27.799 --> 39:29.801
(sighs)

39:35.807 --> 39:37.576
(elevator bell dings)

39:37.609 --> 39:39.411
Mmm.

39:39.445 --> 39:42.481
These chips are the greatest.

39:42.514 --> 39:44.483
They're called crisps, Ellie.

39:44.516 --> 39:46.117
Crisps.

39:47.486 --> 39:49.688
What are we looking at?

39:49.721 --> 39:53.592
Uh... I had to borrow
some of Nick's clothes.

39:53.625 --> 39:54.760
Hmm.
TORRES:
What? He needed clothes.

39:54.793 --> 39:57.696
Hey, we're going to the gym
if you guys want to join.

39:57.729 --> 39:59.698
Yeah, I'm okay.
I do yoga at home.

39:59.731 --> 40:01.467
Do I smell a...
a budding bromance?

40:01.500 --> 40:03.134
What?
TORRES:
You call it bromance,

40:03.168 --> 40:04.636
I call it trouble.

40:04.670 --> 40:05.837
Oh.

40:05.871 --> 40:07.172
I'm just gonna get my phone.
All right.

40:07.205 --> 40:08.173
I'll meet you
down there, mate.

40:08.206 --> 40:09.675
(gasps)

40:09.708 --> 40:11.510
(clears throat)

40:13.211 --> 40:14.179
Hey.

40:14.212 --> 40:15.681
Hey.
It's, uh,

40:15.714 --> 40:17.449
nice to see you
getting settled in here.

40:17.483 --> 40:18.784
Hardly.

40:18.817 --> 40:19.851
Can I ask you,

40:19.885 --> 40:21.853
did you, um, volunteer

40:21.887 --> 40:23.922
for a Navy operation
called Willoughby?

40:23.955 --> 40:26.825
I mean, they were only
looking for recruits that were

40:26.858 --> 40:28.494
willing to take risks, you know?

40:28.527 --> 40:30.629
It's like a... suicide mission.

40:32.130 --> 40:34.533
I know what I signed up for.

40:34.566 --> 40:35.767
I have my reasons.

40:45.577 --> 40:46.612
So...

40:46.645 --> 40:48.747
you want to talk?

40:51.650 --> 40:54.252
There are a few
manufacturing firms

40:54.285 --> 40:57.122
looking to lay down
roots in the area.

40:57.155 --> 40:59.491
If Brighton closes,
it might be a good fit.

40:59.525 --> 41:00.792
You ever stop working?

41:00.826 --> 41:02.928
I'll stop when you stop.

41:02.961 --> 41:05.030
I'm pouring drinks. I'm done.

41:05.063 --> 41:06.097
No, you're not.

41:07.933 --> 41:10.969
You never answered why you took
such a personal interest in me.

41:12.003 --> 41:14.239
Well, it has...

41:14.272 --> 41:16.675
nothing to do
with your appropriations vote.

41:16.708 --> 41:17.776
No.

41:17.809 --> 41:19.244
It was because of your wife.

41:19.277 --> 41:20.679
Jackie Vance

41:20.712 --> 41:24.149
started a nonprofit organization
six years ago,

41:24.182 --> 41:26.251
a domestic violence shelter.

41:26.284 --> 41:28.954
It's been without a chairperson
since her passing.

41:28.987 --> 41:30.789
You do your research.

41:30.822 --> 41:32.090
So do you.

41:33.625 --> 41:35.827
I can't take the position.

41:35.861 --> 41:37.062
I made a deal
with the good people

41:37.095 --> 41:38.830
of the ninth district

41:38.864 --> 41:42.834
to focus 100% of my efforts
on them.

41:42.868 --> 41:44.603
But I do have
some friends.

41:44.636 --> 41:47.606
Well, I would love
to hear about them.

41:47.639 --> 41:48.740
Over...

41:48.774 --> 41:51.677
drinks in your musty office?

41:54.780 --> 41:56.615
Okay.

41:57.649 --> 41:59.250
How about a quiet dinner?

41:59.284 --> 42:01.319
Took you long enough to ask,
Leon.

42:01.352 --> 42:02.320
(chuckles)

42:02.353 --> 42:03.689
Yeah, it's politics.

42:03.722 --> 42:05.323
Mm-hmm.
Give or take.

42:05.356 --> 42:06.825
Sushi or Italian?

42:06.858 --> 42:07.826
I hate sushi.

42:07.859 --> 42:08.827
Italian it is.
Done.

42:08.860 --> 42:10.261
But I'm paying.

42:10.295 --> 42:12.297
Mm.

42:16.067 --> 42:17.736
