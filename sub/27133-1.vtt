of the 102nd Annual White House
Correspondents' Dinner.

11:32.149 --> 11:35.277
[reporter #2]  And this fellow
I believe here is The Fat Jewish,

11:35.361 --> 11:39.198
who is an Instagram sensation.

11:39.448 --> 11:41.534
And I don't know how
he gets his braid to do that.

11:41.617 --> 11:43.369
That's pretty impressive.

11:44.745 --> 11:46.205
What's up? My name is Josh.

11:46.288 --> 11:49.500
People call me The Fat Jew,
or The Fat Jewish.

11:49.583 --> 11:51.127
Or Jewther Vandross.

11:51.210 --> 11:52.628
Or Jew Diamond Phillips.

11:52.712 --> 11:53.838

11:54.213 --> 11:55.464

11:59.009 --> 12:02.138
People who do what I do,
which is basically cultural commentary.

12:02.221 --> 12:04.181
Like, see something, talk about it.

12:04.849 --> 12:06.726
Like, it's a new kind of art form.

12:08.436 --> 12:11.355
Everywhere I go, I want people to be like,
"What the fuck?"

12:11.439 --> 12:13.399
If it makes sense,
I don't want to be there.

12:13.482 --> 12:14.692
[drill whirring]

12:14.775 --> 12:16.360
No one on the internet can be normal.

12:16.444 --> 12:18.362
Everyone on social media
is so extreme, right?

12:18.446 --> 12:19.947
And the more extreme
it gets both ways,

12:20.030 --> 12:22.283
the bigger you know you're getting,
the more traction.

12:23.701 --> 12:25.286
Arianna Huffington invited me

12:25.369 --> 12:27.997
to the White House Correspondents' Dinner.

12:28.789 --> 12:30.833
And then I was at a table with DJ Khaled.

12:30.916 --> 12:33.169
I thought it was gonna be
more politicians and stuff,

12:33.252 --> 12:35.379
but it's all just celebrities,
all hanging out.

12:35.463 --> 12:36.797
So fucking weird.

12:36.881 --> 12:38.716
And it's like bad Bar Mitzvah food.

12:39.508 --> 12:41.719
So I took this picture with Obama,

12:41.927 --> 12:44.472
'cause I had, like,
the big hair dildo erection,

12:44.972 --> 12:46.932
and I was like,
"Yo, when you get out of office,

12:47.016 --> 12:48.851
you should grow a hairection."

12:48.934 --> 12:50.686
And he was like... [laughs]

12:50.770 --> 12:53.272
Like, "Michelle, should I grow this?
This is great."

12:53.731 --> 12:55.483
I think he genuinely thought it was funny,

12:55.566 --> 12:59.028
'cause he was just like,
"Who is this giant mongoloid idiot?"

13:04.658 --> 13:06.076

13:07.828 --> 13:09.288

-What up?

13:10.247 --> 13:13.876
Yes! This is a motherfuckin'
puppy mansion.

13:13.959 --> 13:14.877
It has AC?

13:15.503 --> 13:16.712
I wanna sleep in here.

13:16.796 --> 13:18.005
[dog whines]

13:18.088 --> 13:19.256
Great place!

13:22.510 --> 13:23.344
You I know!

13:24.637 --> 13:26.138
You I've seen on the internet.

13:26.680 --> 13:27.515
Fuck yeah!

13:28.182 --> 13:31.268
These dogs, most of these dogs
are more famous than me.

13:31.685 --> 13:33.521
[camera shutter chimes]

13:36.816 --> 13:37.650
Hey!

13:38.609 --> 13:42.446
Wow. I mean, this is like,
these are individualized photos.

13:42.530 --> 13:45.157
This is one of the most incredible things
I've ever seen.

13:46.116 --> 13:47.243
This is... [laughs]

13:48.202 --> 13:49.620
this is fucking gorgeous.

13:50.246 --> 13:53.207
It's literally Paris at the last supper

13:53.290 --> 13:55.376
with only important people.

13:56.335 --> 13:58.963
Paris   is a straight-up fucking icon.

13:59.046 --> 14:01.048
She set the precedent for everyone

14:01.131 --> 14:03.968
who exists in this internet
likes-driven world.

14:04.385 --> 14:06.428
The modern-day ideas of celebrity,

14:06.512 --> 14:08.472
of brands, of marketing,

14:08.973 --> 14:13.227
the way that we think about influence--
this was all invented by Paris Hilton.

14:13.936 --> 14:17.857
My entire model for what I do
is what Paris does.

14:18.649 --> 14:23.279
But until I have a puppy mansion,
and a painting of myself at a last supper,

14:23.362 --> 14:25.239
I haven't gotten where I need to be.

14:25.781 --> 14:28.325
I would hope to get insanely rich.

14:29.201 --> 14:31.161
I wanna have really traditional stuff
happen to me,

14:31.245 --> 14:33.330
like someone I'm close with
scams me out of money.

14:33.414 --> 14:36.500
I wanna develop a serious drug problem.
End up at Passages.

14:36.584 --> 14:39.837
Go through, like, a real turmoil.
You know what I mean?

14:39.920 --> 14:41.714
Like have shit get really crazy,

14:41.797 --> 14:44.216
like, you know, like, hit a paparazzi.

14:44.300 --> 14:47.761
You know what I mean? Like really classic
spiral shit on my way to the top.

14:48.095 --> 14:49.763
I wanna get, like, genuinely famous,

14:49.847 --> 14:52.308
where, like, I get off a plane in,
like, Serbia

14:52.391 --> 14:54.351
and, like, a woman is, like, crying.
You know?

14:54.435 --> 14:56.312
Or, like, a man pukes
'cause he's so excited.

14:56.395 --> 14:58.022
[crowd screaming]

14:58.105 --> 14:59.440
That would be super tight.

15:02.026 --> 15:02.860
Thank you.

15:17.333 --> 15:18.751
All right. Check it out, guys.

15:18.834 --> 15:21.003
This weekend I'm going
back out on the road.

15:21.170 --> 15:24.673
Thursday, February 9th,
I'm at the Lost and Found in Toronto.

Friday, February 10th,
I'm at Music nightclub in Calgary,

-Uh, God.

15:35.392 --> 15:37.603
This is known as a breathalyzer.

15:37.686 --> 15:40.981
It is possibly the most dangerous thing
I've ever brought out.

15:41.231 --> 15:45.235
You're literally just trying to beat
each other's score until one of you dies.

15:50.407 --> 15:52.368
[woman]  A famous photographer named Kirill

15:52.451 --> 15:55.162
was hired to come here
and do what he does best:

15:55.245 --> 15:56.956
take some pictures
and create some hype.

into a club where I'm at,

16:08.717 --> 16:10.803
they know what
they're buying a ticket for.

16:12.262 --> 16:14.848
We brought a waterproof bag for my phone.

16:15.432 --> 16:17.101
He makes us feel sexy.

16:17.810 --> 16:19.603

16:21.021 --> 16:23.649

all over their bare breasts.

If they felt like it was degrading
or disgusting,

16:37.454 --> 16:41.125
I feel like they wouldn't come back.
He wouldn't be as popular as he is.

16:42.042 --> 16:44.503
[Kirill]  There's no one going
to a nightclub to listen to music.

16:44.586 --> 16:47.172
You're going there to get drunk
and eventually get laid.

16:47.256 --> 16:49.591
You wanna have a good time.
You wanna have a memory.

16:49.675 --> 16:52.720
You wanna have a funny story.
People are kind of drawn to me because

16:53.303 --> 16:55.514
that's what I'm trying to bring
to nightlife.

16:55.931 --> 16:58.642
A nightclub will be like,
in the same way that we book the DJ,

16:58.726 --> 17:02.187
we want to book you.
And I go on my social media like,

17:02.271 --> 17:04.023
"Guys, I'll be at-- in this town."

17:04.106 --> 17:05.816

but it's really what happens though.

17:18.078 --> 17:20.748
The internet's full of people
that are just furious with me.

They look at me like,
"This is demeaning.

17:24.376 --> 17:26.378
This is not what
our culture should stand for."

17:26.962 --> 17:29.548
We're all hypocrites
afraid of our own urges.

17:29.631 --> 17:32.968
So, we demonize the people
that are free to be able to do this.

17:34.762 --> 17:37.473
Instagram and I
have a very troubled history.

17:37.931 --> 17:39.099
When it first came out,

17:39.183 --> 17:42.478
I was just like, "All right! My name's
gonna be kirillwashere on Instagram."

17:42.644 --> 17:46.106
And I lasted three months
before they kicked me off.

17:46.482 --> 17:49.109
I probably went through
13 Instagram accounts,

17:49.193 --> 17:53.030
like kirillionaire, kirillex,
kirillgotmepregnant.

17:53.614 --> 17:57.201
Literally could not think of
any more names for myself on Instagram

17:57.284 --> 18:01.455
and then someone's like "slutwhisperer"
and I was, "It's kinda funny."

18:01.997 --> 18:03.248
And I just registered it.

18:03.332 --> 18:06.585
And for some fucked-up reason,

18:06.668 --> 18:07.920
they left me alone.

18:08.212 --> 18:09.379
I know you guys, you're like,

18:09.463 --> 18:12.925
"Kirill, I hope you didn't forget about us
in Chicago this Friday."

18:13.217 --> 18:16.136
No, I didn't!
We're still coming to Chicago!

18:16.220 --> 18:17.971
They verified me. I'm like, "Oh, boy.

18:18.263 --> 18:22.434
They probably did not wanna add
that kinda approval to the shit I do."

18:25.979 --> 18:28.148
Whatever I wanna say or express

18:28.232 --> 18:30.275
might not be popular opinion always

18:30.859 --> 18:34.029
but it's become
more of an extension of me.

18:34.613 --> 18:37.157
I'm gonna make the jokes
I really wanna make,

18:37.241 --> 18:38.826
whether it's making fun of Jews,

18:38.909 --> 18:40.369
making fun of abortion--

18:41.036 --> 18:42.412
there are no boundaries.

18:43.330 --> 18:46.208
And this is where
I really catch people off guard because

18:46.291 --> 18:47.751
I play the lowest common denominator.

18:47.835 --> 18:50.045
Because that's how you reach
the most amount of people.

18:51.839 --> 18:54.800
We also gotta realize
how many ghost followers I have.

18:55.259 --> 18:59.304
Like, huge names come up to me
and people that are like,

named 'slutwhisperer'."

A bunch of girls from
Pretty Little Liars  follow me.

19:10.816 --> 19:12.359
I'm like, "Are you out of your mind?"

what the fuck
are you liking my post about

19:19.283 --> 19:20.784
making fun of fat girls today?

19:22.452 --> 19:25.747
I think people are attracted to the fact
that it's just fun

19:25.831 --> 19:28.500
and the-- Maybe that
they're not willing to do that,

19:29.042 --> 19:30.919
and they're just voyeurs in this little...

19:31.503 --> 19:32.713
thing I've created.

19:33.088 --> 19:37.843
We can officially
stop referring to Emily Ratajkowski

19:38.010 --> 19:40.304
as the model
from the "Blurred Lines" video.

19:40.470 --> 19:42.973
The 22-year-old beauty
who caught everyone's attention

19:43.056 --> 19:45.642

has been crowned

19:48.187 --> 19:49.688
It was just a job for me.

19:49.771 --> 19:51.940
I just went into it thinking, like,
"Okay, great. Payday.

19:52.024 --> 19:53.817
Who knows what this will be like?"

19:53.901 --> 19:56.987
And then the internet just started,
like, exploding a little bit

19:57.070 --> 19:58.780
and then I guess
that's when I started to see

19:58.864 --> 20:01.909
people following me
in a way that I hadn't seen before.

20:01.992 --> 20:03.410
It's really empowering.

20:03.493 --> 20:06.830
I look back at actresses
or models 20 years ago.

20:06.914 --> 20:09.958
Everything that they said
was filtered through the media,

20:10.417 --> 20:12.336
and someone who barely knew them.

20:12.419 --> 20:16.048
And now, I have a direct connection
to 15 million people.

20:17.132 --> 20:21.136
The control that a woman can have
over her own image is really powerful.

20:22.012 --> 20:26.016
We're able to have forums
and ways of posting what you want,

20:26.099 --> 20:28.185
and that's what fourth-wave feminism
is about.

It's about accessibility to technology.

"DJ Khaled!"

21:45.012 --> 21:46.638
And you're like, "Who is this guy?"

21:47.139 --> 21:49.725
And I think he is brilliant

21:49.808 --> 21:52.936

with social media happening

in a way to be like,

21:59.526 --> 22:03.155
"I'm going to let people in on my life."
I don't even think DJ Khaled's a persona.

22:03.238 --> 22:04.948
I think that that just is who he is.

22:05.407 --> 22:07.284
[Khaled]  I used to work at Shoney's
as a bus boy.

22:07.659 --> 22:09.995
I used to sell clothes
out the trunk of my car.

22:10.078 --> 22:13.373
You're looking at 25 years of blood,
sweat, and tears. Actually more.

22:13.999 --> 22:16.918

biggest music moguls in the world.

it went number one record in the country!

so get ready for a new alert!

22:32.225 --> 22:34.561
Before I was at just one city
in a nightclub.

22:34.936 --> 22:37.314
Now I can rip a stage or arena,

22:37.397 --> 22:39.191
or even being in my room

22:39.274 --> 22:43.487
and you can just pick up your phone and
you can show your talents to the world.

Stand-up comedy pre-internet,
that was, like,

22:48.408 --> 22:51.620
11 years of
just languishing on the road.

22:51.703 --> 22:53.413
And then MySpace started

22:53.497 --> 22:55.624
and from there everybody started
booking me.

22:55.707 --> 22:58.251
And literally it was ripple effect
that went across the country.

22:58.335 --> 23:00.504
I was one of the first to do it,

23:00.587 --> 23:02.964
but now with
what people are able to do,

23:03.048 --> 23:05.217
I don't feel like fame is fame anymore.

23:05.884 --> 23:07.552
The kid from the Super Bowl,

23:07.677 --> 23:09.471
who took the selfie
with Justin Timberlake,

23:09.554 --> 23:12.766
he becomes an instant meme,
and is everywhere!

23:12.849 --> 23:14.601
To me, it looked like
you were right there,

23:14.684 --> 23:17.104
but you got yourself there.
You were a few rows back.

23:17.187 --> 23:19.731
Yeah, I pushed through.
I was elbowing people.

23:19.815 --> 23:21.858
[Hailey]  It's like instantly,

23:22.025 --> 23:24.569

"Oh, aren't you that kid from
the Super Bowl that took the selfie?"

23:27.572 --> 23:30.158

how this works.

23:30.242 --> 23:31.743

23:31.827 --> 23:34.329
Does that mean you're gonna be
not famous instantly?

23:34.413 --> 23:36.832

that that person said that? I don't know.

24:10.323 --> 24:13.952
Andy Warhol talked about it best
before the internet was even a thing.

24:14.035 --> 24:15.620
It is about 15 minutes of fame.

Look at this.
That must've been your first birthday.

24:30.969 --> 24:32.637
It was 'cause it was my 21st birthday.

24:32.721 --> 24:35.348
-Why have I not seen these?
-Look how conservative I was.

24:35.932 --> 24:38.810
Do you have any of the old pictures
of me and Andy Warhol?

24:39.436 --> 24:42.439
I have them somewhere. I will find--
I'm just going through all this stuff.

24:42.522 --> 24:44.608
-Please find them. That would be so epic.
-I know.

24:45.358 --> 24:47.527
You are exactly what he would have loved.

24:48.528 --> 24:51.281
This was the heyday of Studio 54.

24:52.157 --> 24:54.576
And that's Andy
and he's naked behind this.

24:54.784 --> 24:56.036
[Paris] Holding it up like that?

24:56.119 --> 24:57.913
[Kathy] Uh-huh. And then me.

24:58.163 --> 25:00.624
[Paris] I wanna take a picture of that
for Throwback Thursday.

25:01.917 --> 25:02.876
Killing it.

25:03.627 --> 25:05.587
How old were you
when you did the shoot?

25:06.713 --> 25:08.465
Probably 20?

25:11.843 --> 25:14.054
My parents were always
very strict with me.

25:15.222 --> 25:16.515
[man] Look at Paris.

25:16.598 --> 25:19.768
She's getting so gorgeous and tall.

25:21.144 --> 25:22.687
[Paris]  I wasn't allowed to go out.

25:22.771 --> 25:24.731
I wasn't allowed to go on dates
or wear makeup.

25:25.357 --> 25:27.859
I was 15 years old
when we moved to New York.

25:28.693 --> 25:29.653
My sister and I...

25:30.320 --> 25:33.865
all a sudden we started being invited
to all these events and parties.

25:35.492 --> 25:38.787
So we kind of really grew up fast,
living in New York.

25:39.538 --> 25:41.665
I just wanted to be known as Paris,

25:41.748 --> 25:44.501
and not be known as
the Hilton Hotel granddaughter.

25:44.584 --> 25:47.629
So I always felt like I needed to break
away from that

25:47.712 --> 25:49.839
and do my own thing.

25:50.423 --> 25:54.135
I met David LaChappelle,
who I was obsessed with

25:54.219 --> 25:57.889
because I had seen all of his photos
and just what a genius he was.

25:58.765 --> 26:00.100
And he said, "What is your name?"

26:00.183 --> 26:01.476
I said, "My name is Paris."

26:02.519 --> 26:05.313
He's like, "You're a star.
You're gonna be my muse."

26:05.397 --> 26:07.399
Like Andy Warhol had Edie Sedgwick.

26:08.191 --> 26:09.442
I was very young.

26:09.985 --> 26:13.488
I was shy. But with David,
I would have fun and dress up and play.

26:14.406 --> 26:18.451
David told me, "Paris, I have an idea.
I wanna shoot you and your sister."

26:18.743 --> 26:20.620
My sister was 15 years old,

26:20.704 --> 26:22.706
so we lied to my parents

26:22.789 --> 26:26.042
and pretended we were going
to our cousin's birthday.

26:26.543 --> 26:28.878
Uh, David and his team flew Nicky out.

26:29.546 --> 26:30.797
We went to

26:31.339 --> 26:32.507
this motel

26:33.216 --> 26:35.760
on La Cienega Boulevard in LA
that's very infamous.

26:36.469 --> 26:40.390
Posing in very risque outfits
with the necklaces that said "Rich."

26:41.474 --> 26:43.393
This other picture, too. Oh, my God.

26:44.185 --> 26:45.770
You might have to blur this.

26:46.354 --> 26:49.149
One of the makeup people
pulled the top down for one second.

26:49.232 --> 26:50.233
I had no clue.

26:50.317 --> 26:52.861
They were pouring water in my hair
and my face.

26:52.944 --> 26:53.987
I couldn't see.

26:54.571 --> 26:56.865
And then me in my grandparents' house

26:56.948 --> 27:00.577
at three or four in the morning.
I thought it was just all for fun, like,

27:00.660 --> 27:03.079
"No one's ever gonna see these pictures."

27:03.163 --> 27:06.082
And then, all of a sudden,
he called me and he said, "Oh, my God,

27:06.291 --> 27:07.250
I have great news!"

27:07.334 --> 27:11.463
I'm like, "What?"
He's like,  "Vanity Fair  loves our photos."

27:12.464 --> 27:16.092
When I opened up the magazine
and saw that, I wanted to...

27:17.010 --> 27:17.927
take him...

27:19.429 --> 27:20.555
and strangle him.

27:22.432 --> 27:24.476
I can't believe that they would do this.

27:25.477 --> 27:26.853
This is not my daughter.

27:27.520 --> 27:28.647
I mean, that's crazy.

27:28.938 --> 27:31.524
This picture got me in so much trouble.

27:32.817 --> 27:35.320
Because of that photo shoot,
I was immediately, like,

27:35.403 --> 27:37.864
the crazy socialite party girl.

27:37.947 --> 27:39.949
From there, it just kind of blew up.

27:48.083 --> 27:49.250
[man]  I moved to Los Angeles

27:49.334 --> 27:53.505
kind of around the birth of the
Paris Hilton blueprint for celebrity.

27:54.297 --> 27:55.924
She wasn't an actress,
she wasn't a dancer,

27:56.007 --> 27:58.551
she wasn't a musician.
She was just this, kind of entity

27:58.635 --> 28:01.930
in Hollywood that was everywhere.

28:02.681 --> 28:03.932

-I'm good, hi.

28:07.560 --> 28:10.480
Came here to be an actor. Do all that
kind of stuff, kind of got sidetracked

["Toxic" by Britney Spears playing]

28:14.317 --> 28:17.278
That was one of the first things
that I utilized social media to book.

28:17.946 --> 28:19.739
It was before anyone was doing that,
so people were like,

28:19.823 --> 28:21.950
"How the hell did you do that?"
When I told them, they didn't believe me.

28:22.033 --> 28:24.494
I'm probably in that for... six seconds?

28:25.120 --> 28:26.162
Everyone knew who I was.

28:26.246 --> 28:28.915
I was the dude in the Britney Spears video
for a decade.

28:30.208 --> 28:33.128
You want to become
your own entity and brand?

28:33.211 --> 28:35.755
Yeah, I think a lot of people
have been asking me,

28:35.839 --> 28:37.382
"Are you a model?
Or are you an actress?"

28:37.465 --> 28:40.427
[Matthew]
When Emily Ratajkowski went viral,

28:40.510 --> 28:43.179
it was a very different time
from when I did that "Toxic" video.

28:43.263 --> 28:46.266
The difference, being able to be
in the driver's seat yourself

28:46.349 --> 28:48.226
and perpetuate your own attention
that you get,

28:48.309 --> 28:50.437
whereas for me, going back to 2004,

28:50.520 --> 28:52.981
I had to hire a publicist, have an agent

28:53.064 --> 28:55.942
in order to even get
my face and name out there.

28:56.025 --> 28:59.070
But with social media,
everyone thinks they're an influencer.

28:59.738 --> 29:02.407
I started to see everyone else's
self-indulgent bullshit.

29:02.490 --> 29:04.325
I love my butt lifter.

29:04.409 --> 29:08.580
I love it because it just gives me
that extra Kim K lift.

29:09.247 --> 29:10.957
[Matthew]  And it was such a turn-off

29:11.040 --> 29:13.209
that I was like,
"I don't wanna be a part of this."

32:24.442 --> 32:27.070
Came out here,
fell for every scam in the book.

32:27.654 --> 32:30.490
I paid $1,800 for head shots.

32:30.865 --> 32:34.577
I would scrounge up $600
and pay for a shitty improv class

32:34.661 --> 32:37.455
that the teacher was
in a Geico commercial.

32:37.538 --> 32:40.041
I had no money.
My dad was supporting me.

32:40.375 --> 32:42.460
Every day my parents would call me,
"Come home!

32:42.543 --> 32:44.837
There's no point in you being there!
You don't know anybody!

32:44.921 --> 32:46.798
Get home! You're not gonna
make it happen. Stop."

32:46.881 --> 32:50.176
Literally no one believed in me.
And then I saw Kelly Oxford,

32:50.259 --> 32:52.095
who's a really funny comedian.

32:52.178 --> 32:53.888
I saw her advertise Vine.

32:53.972 --> 32:57.725
It was just, you hold your finger down
on the screen and you record a video,

32:57.809 --> 32:59.852
and it's six seconds,
just little bits of your day.

32:59.936 --> 33:01.771
I was like,
"Oh, let me check this out."

33:01.854 --> 33:03.398
[human screaming]

33:04.065 --> 33:06.025
-Do you like being in the front seat?
-Yeah.

33:06.484 --> 33:09.112
[Brittany]  So, I started doing
little sketch videos with my friends

33:09.195 --> 33:12.448
and I started to put them on the Vine.

33:12.532 --> 33:14.075
You know you want this V!

33:14.158 --> 33:15.910
How to hit on guys
the way guys hit on girls.

33:15.994 --> 33:19.747
Hey, baby! I'd like to lick
yo buttcrack sideways!

33:20.623 --> 33:23.793
At first, I thought, you know,
"Hey, girl, instead of screwin' around

33:24.335 --> 33:28.297
with this Vine, why don't you look for
some real work to get into?"

33:28.381 --> 33:31.259
But it just took off.
It shocked the heck outta me.

33:31.634 --> 33:33.845
My following started growing like crazy!

33:33.928 --> 33:35.596
And it started to just
grow, grow, grow.

33:36.597 --> 33:41.811
And I have 4.2 billion...
billion... Vine views.

33:42.020 --> 33:45.231
What I loved about it was that I didn't
need anybody's permission to perform.

33:45.314 --> 33:47.025
I didn't have to audition
for anybody.

33:47.108 --> 33:48.651
I could do whatever the fuck I wanted.

33:59.829 --> 34:02.832
[Kirill]  My love of Disney started
when I came to America from Russia.

34:03.291 --> 34:08.004
I was always, like, a nerdy Jewish
suburban little white kid.

34:08.838 --> 34:10.465
Kind of quiet and shy.

34:11.299 --> 34:13.634
I never was part of the cool kids.

34:14.343 --> 34:17.013
Then when I got to high school
and became more and more immature,

34:17.096 --> 34:19.474
I started doodling some offensive shit.

34:19.557 --> 34:21.267
Making fun of teachers, you know,

34:21.350 --> 34:23.019
just trying to fit in with kids.

34:23.770 --> 34:27.315
And then, you know how the school
puts out, like, "Most likely to succeed"

34:27.398 --> 34:28.941
or whatever that fuckin' horse shit is:

34:29.025 --> 34:31.486
well, on the unofficial list,

34:31.944 --> 34:35.406
I was most likely to draw
hidden boners in Disney cartoons.

34:39.160 --> 34:41.370
I went to college to be a Disney animator.

34:42.080 --> 34:43.915
And then I kind of
fell out of love with it.

34:43.998 --> 34:48.211
I need instant gratification
and animation just takes too long.

34:48.294 --> 34:50.755
So I was like, "Fuck it.
I'm leaving college."

34:53.841 --> 34:57.095
At this time, I was, like,
falling in love with stand-up.

34:57.178 --> 35:01.057
Every show I went to, I would, like,
save the little playbills they had.

35:01.516 --> 35:04.060
This guy, 2003.

35:05.019 --> 35:07.438
Here's when you know
you're officially drunk right here.

35:07.522 --> 35:10.900
When you get into a taxicab,
and you think the fare is the time.

35:11.609 --> 35:13.611
[laughter]

35:14.570 --> 35:17.323
Oh my God, it's 25 past 24.
Holy shit.

35:18.157 --> 35:21.119
[Kirill] The way these people think,
the way they look at the world.

35:21.202 --> 35:23.079
I was like, "This is really amazing."

35:23.746 --> 35:24.831
[comic]  It's funny though.

35:24.956 --> 35:26.499
When someone gets racial
with you when you're white,

35:26.582 --> 35:28.793
you're not allowed to get racial back,
you know what I mean?

35:28.876 --> 35:31.921
So, it's kinda like awkward.
The dude's goin' at you, "White boy!

35:32.046 --> 35:33.214
You cracka!"

35:33.297 --> 35:35.174
You're like, "Yeah, you stupid jerk."

35:35.424 --> 35:37.468
[Kirill]  My mom was very scared.

35:37.552 --> 35:40.138
The way I was starting to think
and the way I was starting to talk.

35:40.221 --> 35:44.433
She was like, "I feel like these people
are taking you in a very dark place."

35:44.517 --> 35:47.145
Never let a woman
put a condom on you, okay?

35:47.228 --> 35:48.479
Do it yourself.

35:48.563 --> 35:50.815
'Cause when a lady does it,
it can be embarrassing.

35:50.898 --> 35:53.901
It's like, "Oh, look,
there's still more room!"

35:53.985 --> 35:55.153
[laughter]

35:55.736 --> 35:58.531
I learned how to speak to people
and make them laugh.

35:59.115 --> 36:03.035
I used to spend
seven days a week in a comedy club

36:03.119 --> 36:05.329
and I actually never got sick of it.

36:05.413 --> 36:07.456
I wanted to be indispensable
to these people,

36:07.915 --> 36:10.042
so I would shoot them,
be like, "Here's some photos."

36:10.418 --> 36:12.712
And that's when I fell in love with it.

36:13.296 --> 36:14.797
This doesn't feel like a job,

36:15.631 --> 36:17.466
but I'm making money doing it.

36:17.550 --> 36:22.555
This was like crazy moment
seeing Robin on stage at Carolines.

36:23.264 --> 36:24.765
This is one of my favorites,

36:24.849 --> 36:26.976
Aziz and Kanye backstage
at our comedy club.

36:27.351 --> 36:29.145
When was the last time
you saw Kanye smile?

36:29.729 --> 36:31.147
This is a photo I took of Nas.

36:31.230 --> 36:33.191
I put these photos online the next day.

36:33.649 --> 36:37.987
Within two hours, his team and Def Jam
hit me and they're like,

36:38.070 --> 36:39.822
"Take these off the site.
We're buying these."

36:39.906 --> 36:41.949
And that became
my relationship with Nas.

36:42.033 --> 36:44.660
They trusted me from that moment
to shoot everything for him.

36:44.744 --> 36:48.122
This is the photo to this day
on Apple Music.

36:48.789 --> 36:51.542
And Nas' world opened up to me
where I got to shoot

36:51.626 --> 36:53.544
some of the craziest
legendary artists.

36:54.128 --> 36:56.547
Uh. Iconic photo. Bieber.

36:57.131 --> 36:59.175
This is me tryin' to be
a little bit of a fame whore,

36:59.258 --> 37:01.052
"Okay, this'll get me a lot of love."

37:01.135 --> 37:03.429
I wasn't really taking
Pulitzer Prize-winning photos.

37:03.512 --> 37:05.473
I just wanted to take fun party photos,

37:05.556 --> 37:08.059
and then add that humor
that I was taught.

37:09.685 --> 37:12.605
This is a girl on crystal meth
running through the desert.

37:12.688 --> 37:16.484
Oh, here's a chick passed out
underneath the fuckin' table at a party.

37:16.567 --> 37:18.402
At least she's got her shoes on, right?

37:18.486 --> 37:20.071
I was shooting
a lot of these parties

37:20.154 --> 37:23.282
and we started pouring champagne in
girls' mouths 'cause it'd be a cool photo.

37:23.366 --> 37:25.743
And then I think at some point,
I got nudged and I missed

37:25.826 --> 37:27.828
and I hit her face,
but the camera went off.

37:27.912 --> 37:30.831
I was like, "This is kind of a cool
photo." Like the way it hits your face.

37:31.290 --> 37:33.501
And I put up, like, the best 50 photos.

37:33.709 --> 37:35.336
Within 24 hours, it exploded.

37:35.419 --> 37:37.296
I remember a bunch of sites
picked it up,

37:37.380 --> 37:39.590
and I remember walking
through a nightclub two days later,

37:39.674 --> 37:41.926
and these two girls at the bar are like,

37:42.009 --> 37:43.552
"Oh, shit, that's Kirill.

37:43.636 --> 37:45.763
I wonder if we're gonna get
a champagne facial tonight."

37:45.846 --> 37:49.850
And I was like, "Whoa. Okay,
this is bigger than I thought it was."

37:50.851 --> 37:52.645
And then I got sucked in the night life,

37:52.728 --> 37:55.398
and part of me wishes I didn't,

37:55.481 --> 37:58.276
but that's the foundation of
what everything is now.

37:58.943 --> 38:01.529
Before it got all
fuckin' slutty and gross.

38:05.324 --> 38:07.243
[Josh]  Breaking into
the modeling world is not easy.

38:07.326 --> 38:09.328
Obviously, I don't have a 60-pack

38:09.412 --> 38:11.872
and, like, deep,
V-shaped dick lines,

38:11.956 --> 38:13.666
so it's hard for me
to get into that scene.

38:13.749 --> 38:17.169
Also, the plus-size scene is
not exactly my thing either.

38:17.253 --> 38:20.756
I think they should rename the genre.
You know, just like, "Sturdy men."

38:20.840 --> 38:23.301
Or like "thick, thick fellas."

38:25.386 --> 38:27.847
I was, like, always super performative.

38:29.348 --> 38:31.475
Growing up in New York,
I was a child actor.

38:32.143 --> 38:33.728
I booked a Hershey's commercial.

38:34.020 --> 38:35.479
I was on fire.

38:35.563 --> 38:38.357
I showed up to school with a jean jacket
with the collar popped

38:38.441 --> 38:40.192
and was basically just like,
"Daddy's home."

38:40.693 --> 38:42.486
'Cause kids were seeing this commercial,

38:42.570 --> 38:45.156
and then I never got anything after that.

38:46.115 --> 38:48.034
My dad was like, "Get a fucking job."

38:48.117 --> 38:49.410
And I was like, "I'm 12."

38:49.493 --> 38:51.704
Let's talk about
where it started to go bad.

38:52.413 --> 38:54.165
-All the masturbation.
-I was basically,

38:54.248 --> 38:56.917
"Get out of my room, Dad!
You don't understand me!"

38:57.001 --> 38:59.378
Like, "Don't try to make me
a better person!"

38:59.462 --> 39:01.922
I know but you were screwing a pillow
at the time.

39:02.006 --> 39:05.634
I have to blame you for my,
you know, small penis.

39:05.968 --> 39:07.762
No, that's your mother's side
of the family.

39:08.220 --> 39:12.600
My brother is an amateur bodybuilder
who works at the Pentagon.

39:12.725 --> 39:15.978
This dude is like, you know, I mean
he looks-- he looks like a freak.

39:16.062 --> 39:16.979
Fantastic.

39:17.063 --> 39:19.607
Oh, you think he looks fantastic.
See, I think he looks deformed,

39:19.690 --> 39:20.941
like he's too big.

39:21.025 --> 39:24.987
Yeah. He makes up for
everything you fucked up.

39:28.324 --> 39:30.201
New York City in the summer
is brutally hot.

39:30.284 --> 39:32.536
A lot of people like to beat the heat.
Whatever.

39:32.620 --> 39:35.748
You know what I like to do?
Cover a slip & slide with nacho cheese

39:35.831 --> 39:38.084
right into a kiddie pool
filled with marinara.

39:40.920 --> 39:43.672
Back in the day, you definitely
couldn't be an internet star.

39:44.256 --> 39:46.884
I was in AOL chat rooms wreaking havoc

39:47.218 --> 39:49.428
because the internet was the internet.
It was so pure.

39:49.512 --> 39:50.930
There were no influencers.

39:51.013 --> 39:53.099
You would do dumb shit
for your friends

39:53.182 --> 39:55.601
before there was any business
of social media.

39:55.684 --> 39:58.562
I was putting on a diaper and running
down the streets of New York

39:58.646 --> 40:00.773
literally just to make 25 people laugh.

40:02.024 --> 40:05.236
My dad tells his friends
that I'm an adult entertainer,

40:05.319 --> 40:07.530
which is not the right thing.

40:07.613 --> 40:09.698
That's wrong, but he doesn't--
I don't know what to call it!

40:10.157 --> 40:12.159
[laughter]

40:14.078 --> 40:15.871
So, I had friends who would
bring me to things,

40:15.955 --> 40:18.666
and corporate people were like,
"Please don't bring your fat friend

40:19.125 --> 40:21.127
to, like, our Sony influencers dinner."

40:21.961 --> 40:26.465
But, all of a sudden, I have, like,
8.5 million teens screaming on my page.

40:26.549 --> 40:30.219
I got my new wine.
Uh, Old Asian Woman Merlot.

40:30.302 --> 40:32.054
I'm going to put my ass
in a bunch of food.

40:32.138 --> 40:33.472
While you're working for food,

40:33.556 --> 40:35.307
I'm gonna fucking sit in food.

40:36.225 --> 40:38.436
[Josh]  Once they realized
the millennials were into it,

40:38.519 --> 40:41.021
all of a sudden the corporate people
were like, "What about you?"

40:41.480 --> 40:44.066
Everybody was just reaching out to me
wanting to do ads,

40:44.150 --> 40:47.361
like Procter & Gamble,
Benefit Cosmetics, Pizza Hut.

40:47.820 --> 40:49.071
Perfect!

40:49.155 --> 40:51.699
[Matthew]  Someone like the Fat Jew,
he'll get written a check from

40:51.782 --> 40:55.911
the shoe company and then he will be told
at eleven o'clock on Thursday morning,

40:55.995 --> 40:58.247
you need to post a picture of yourself

40:58.330 --> 41:01.417
sitting at this pool
with your feet up with these shoes on.

41:01.542 --> 41:03.752
You need to use these hashtags

41:03.836 --> 41:07.798
post it at this time, and then that's
a quote-unquote "organic post."

41:08.883 --> 41:10.885
Life is amazing. You can live smooth.

41:10.968 --> 41:13.387
Imma go casual. D. Wade Hublot.

41:13.471 --> 41:15.973
I post a lot of things
that I genuinely just like.

41:16.390 --> 41:18.893
And I've gotten in trouble
with my agent before being, like,

41:18.976 --> 41:21.479
"Why would you post this?!
You can get paid for doing this!"

41:22.396 --> 41:25.357
[Emily]  Being able to do
a little paid post here and there

41:25.441 --> 41:28.652
has brought me a lot of power in choosing
what movie roles I want.

41:28.736 --> 41:31.739
[Hailey]  I went into a show fitting
the other day, and they had

41:31.822 --> 41:34.700
a bunch of girls' photos next to
each other with little post-its on it

41:34.783 --> 41:37.620
with everybody's Instagram follower count.

41:38.037 --> 41:40.289
I have definitely lost jobs

41:40.372 --> 41:43.042
to girls who had
more followers than I did.

41:43.876 --> 41:46.378
The modeling industry itself
is very harsh

41:46.462 --> 41:48.464
and not easy to be successful in,

41:48.672 --> 41:52.801
and there's girls that're getting
that recognition overnight

41:52.885 --> 41:54.220
because of an app.

41:54.678 --> 41:55.846
[Khaled]  You can't be a dinosaur.

41:56.639 --> 41:58.766
You have to be with time
or ahead of time,

41:59.725 --> 42:02.353
so if it's Instagram, Snapchat, Twitter--

42:02.436 --> 42:03.979
There's so many tools.

42:04.063 --> 42:07.399
So when I see it, I'm already like,
"Oh, is this new?"

42:07.733 --> 42:10.402
I want to know it right away
and I want to master it

42:10.486 --> 42:12.196
and I want to be ahead of it.

42:12.279 --> 42:13.739
♪ You better work, bitch ♪

42:13.822 --> 42:15.866
[reporter]  They are the newest stars
of Hollywood.

42:16.534 --> 42:19.495
Bach and internet sensation Amanda Cerny.

42:20.120 --> 42:21.330
Oh, money's good.

42:21.413 --> 42:22.790
How do you define good money?

42:22.873 --> 42:24.833
I can retire if I wanted to.

42:25.334 --> 42:27.503
-Off of six-second videos?
-Yeah.

42:29.338 --> 42:31.423
Let's make it rain
on Hollywood Boulevard.

42:33.551 --> 42:36.720
There's deals in the millions
on social media.

42:36.804 --> 42:39.890

54:50.245 --> 54:52.539
that everybody follows you around?

54:53.039 --> 54:55.834
Photographers, paparazzi. Why you?

54:56.960 --> 54:58.211
I have no idea.

54:58.295 --> 55:00.380
I'm just living my life.

55:00.463 --> 55:03.300
You don't call them up and say,
"I'm going down to Third Street tomorrow.

55:03.383 --> 55:04.801
-Be there."
-No, actually,

55:04.884 --> 55:07.637
from the moment I wake up
to the moment I go to sleep,

55:07.721 --> 55:10.307
they're outside my house,
following me all day long.

55:17.814 --> 55:22.193
When I was growing up, I was obsessed
with Marilyn Monroe and Brigitte Bardot

55:22.277 --> 55:24.529
and all these beautiful icons.

55:25.196 --> 55:26.948
And always wanted to be like them.

55:28.533 --> 55:30.493
This is called the Paparazzi Machine.

55:31.536 --> 55:33.038
I practice in front of it.

55:33.496 --> 55:35.749
No, I'm kidding. [laughs]

55:35.832 --> 55:37.792
I think I've had enough practice
over the years.

55:37.876 --> 55:40.754
[paparazzi] Hello. Can we get
a couple fashion pictures, please?

55:41.546 --> 55:45.008
-My outfit's awful.
-Oh no, you look beautiful. You're a doll.

55:45.425 --> 55:48.094
[Paris]  Back when I was a teenager,
there was no social media.

55:48.178 --> 55:50.388
I was just like this young girl,

55:50.472 --> 55:54.642
a socialite, going to parties,
getting in trouble,

55:55.602 --> 55:57.812
and living my life

55:57.896 --> 56:02.984
and basically turned it
into a phenomenon.

56:05.403 --> 56:07.781
[Matthew]  When I first moved to LA,
people had baseball hats on,

56:08.198 --> 56:11.159
totally dressed down,
didn't want any attention whatsoever.

56:11.826 --> 56:13.953
A few years later,
Paris kind of started

56:14.037 --> 56:17.040
the "How to get famous
in 100 days" blueprint,

56:18.041 --> 56:19.751
which was call the paparazzi,

56:20.502 --> 56:23.505
expose as much of your private life
as you possibly can.

56:23.880 --> 56:26.549
-[paparazzi] Paris, did you hit Lindsay?
-Ask her, she's right there.

56:26.633 --> 56:28.093
Lindsay, tell them the truth.

56:28.176 --> 56:29.928
[Matthew]  And you're off to the races.

56:31.346 --> 56:33.348
[security guard]
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

56:33.473 --> 56:34.349
-Shit!
-Watch out.

56:34.432 --> 56:37.018
-[Paris] Bye, guys.
-How does it feel with all the flashes?

56:37.394 --> 56:39.437
-Lot of light.
-Thank you, Paris!

56:41.731 --> 56:45.276
It is weird, because sometimes
I will just hear clicks and flashes,

56:45.360 --> 56:46.986
even when they're not happening.

56:47.112 --> 56:48.363
Just over the years,

56:48.947 --> 56:51.616
especially if I'm at Cannes
or somewhere like that,

56:51.699 --> 56:54.369
even when I'm walking in my hotel room
when there's no one,

56:54.452 --> 56:57.580
I'll hear, like, this noise.

56:57.664 --> 56:59.749
[multiple shutters clicking]

56:59.833 --> 57:00.792
Just forever.

57:04.087 --> 57:05.839
I used to go out every single night,

57:05.922 --> 57:08.091
and I lived for it.

57:08.675 --> 57:11.636
Now I just do not give a shit.

57:11.761 --> 57:14.139
I'm just, like, over it.

57:15.682 --> 57:17.225
[Katie Couric] You a big pedicure guy?

57:17.308 --> 57:19.853
Yeah, I like to make sure that
I'm looking terrible at all times,

57:19.936 --> 57:21.563
but I like my feet to be perfect.

57:21.646 --> 57:23.440
-Yeah.
-I think what really makes

57:23.523 --> 57:25.733
-the Fat Jewish the Fat Jewish...
-Right.

57:25.817 --> 57:27.152
...is the captions.

57:27.235 --> 57:28.862
How do you come up
with these captions?

57:28.945 --> 57:31.156
How did George Washington found America?
Know what I mean?

57:31.239 --> 57:34.033
How did whoever painted
the Sistine Chapel do that?

57:34.117 --> 57:35.743
-Michelangelo? Was that who that was?
-Yes.

57:35.827 --> 57:37.620
-Whatever. Yeah, it just is.
-It's just a gift.

57:39.205 --> 57:41.499
We begin with a scandal
that is rocking the internet.

57:41.583 --> 57:44.085
[woman]  A social media star
being called out for plagiarism.

57:44.794 --> 57:46.629
[man]  He's basically taking
other people's memes

57:46.713 --> 57:49.966
and he was posting them on Instagram
like he thought of them.

57:50.049 --> 57:51.843
[Dane Cook]  His Instagram bio even reads,

57:51.926 --> 57:55.430
"United States Creative Director
of Internet Curatorial Affairs."

57:55.638 --> 57:57.182
This is my collection of comedy.

57:57.265 --> 57:59.684
This is a fine tweet from 2015.

57:59.893 --> 58:01.478
Great year, great year for tweets.

58:02.145 --> 58:05.273
[Dane]  Okay, you're getting millions of
followers, but off other people's work.

58:05.815 --> 58:07.984
It used to be
they had to come see you,

58:08.067 --> 58:09.694
steal it from you at the club.

58:09.777 --> 58:11.738
Now, somebody just sees you post it...

58:12.280 --> 58:14.616
you know, screen capture, puts it up,

58:14.699 --> 58:16.117
changes maybe one or two words,

58:16.201 --> 58:18.077
and so now it's like take it
till you make it.

58:18.786 --> 58:21.956
[reporter]  He's going out of his way
to screengrab and cut out the credit.

58:22.040 --> 58:25.585
[male reporter]  And then making money,
signing with a talent agency,

58:25.668 --> 58:28.338
-he signed with a Hollywood talent agency.
-Yeah, a modeling contract...

58:28.796 --> 58:29.923
I can't even pay my rent,

58:30.006 --> 58:33.051
and this guy just got signed
a Comedy Central deal,

58:33.134 --> 58:34.427
a book...

58:34.511 --> 58:35.887
[man]  He's being a fucking dick,

58:35.970 --> 58:37.597
and he's probably a piece of crap.

58:37.680 --> 58:39.766
[commentator]
The rest of the comic community

58:39.849 --> 58:41.559
was so angry over it.

58:41.643 --> 58:43.311
So Comedy Central has decided

58:43.394 --> 58:46.689
to put their plans to work with him
on hold indefinitely.

58:46.773 --> 58:50.068
There are now thousands of other accounts
that engage in similar practices,

58:50.151 --> 58:52.612
but the reason why we blew up
on the Fat Jew

58:52.695 --> 58:54.864
was because he was
the best at stealing.

58:54.948 --> 58:55.907
[thump]

58:56.449 --> 58:58.201
[Josh]  I was basically the first to do it,

58:58.284 --> 59:00.411
and people figured out
you can make money off of it.

59:00.495 --> 59:02.747
And now it's a huge thing.
Lots of kids do it.

59:03.748 --> 59:06.376
I have an army of interns,
who actually get college credit.

59:06.459 --> 59:08.253
They're getting great life experience
out of this.

59:09.128 --> 59:11.714
I love how democratizing the internet is.

59:12.215 --> 59:13.841
It doesn't scare me at all.

59:13.925 --> 59:17.178
As far as plagiarism goes,
I think it's always been happening.

59:17.971 --> 59:21.432
Think about how many politicians are using
the same recycled language

59:21.516 --> 59:22.976
about morality and about family.

59:23.851 --> 59:26.729
It's really dangerous
for people to start limiting

59:26.813 --> 59:30.149
and saying, like, "That doesn't count
for comedy," or "That's not original."

59:30.775 --> 59:33.152
[Josh]  Older people,
who aren't of the internet,

59:33.236 --> 59:35.905
view IP and material one way,

59:35.989 --> 59:38.366
and younger kids view it
a different way.

59:38.741 --> 59:40.827
And the two are interacting
on a daily basis

59:40.910 --> 59:42.370
in one giant, messy forum.

59:42.453 --> 59:44.539
It was an argument that
needed to be had.

59:44.622 --> 59:46.124
It was fucking brewing so hard.

59:46.708 --> 59:49.002
It needed a face
and they put the face on me.

59:49.627 --> 59:52.880
Josh understands why the people
who created the original posts

59:52.964 --> 59:54.841
that he plays with on Instagram
are upset.

59:54.924 --> 59:57.218
He says he will never post something
without credit again.

59:57.302 --> 1:00:00.346
Any time someone says,
"Hey, that was my thing!"

1:00:00.722 --> 1:00:01.598
Automatic credit.

1:00:02.140 --> 1:00:04.934
Now... on a four-eyes basis,
man-to-man...

1:00:05.226 --> 1:00:06.311
Yup.

1:00:06.394 --> 1:00:09.731
What are the chances what you've just
given me is just a blizzard of bullshit?

1:00:09.814 --> 1:00:10.648
[laughs]

1:00:12.609 --> 1:00:15.612
You can't do what I do
and be thin-skinned.

1:00:16.529 --> 1:00:18.197
Otherwise it will fuck you up.

1:00:24.579 --> 1:00:27.707
[female reporter]  It looks like Vine's
six seconds of fame are over.

1:00:27.790 --> 1:00:30.168
The company announced
on Thursday, October 27th

1:00:30.251 --> 1:00:33.129
that it will be shutting down operations
in the coming months.

1:00:34.005 --> 1:00:36.132
[Brittany]  Now I feel like
I'm back to square one.

1:00:37.884 --> 1:00:40.845
And I'm just trying to do
regular acting again,

1:00:40.928 --> 1:00:42.430
but it's really hard.

1:00:43.139 --> 1:00:44.557
Welcome to  Seinfeld.

1:00:44.641 --> 1:00:46.559
Oh yay! Okay, and where
do I get changed?

1:00:46.934 --> 1:00:48.227
Right over there.

1:00:48.603 --> 1:00:50.146
I get changed in that thing?

1:00:50.938 --> 1:00:52.607
Guys, I'm A-list, okay?

1:00:52.690 --> 1:00:54.067
This is big stuff here.

1:00:54.150 --> 1:00:57.195
I went out for a couple shows.
I didn't book anything.

1:00:57.570 --> 1:01:01.908
I go in on these auditions, and people
don't really wanna take you seriously

1:01:01.991 --> 1:01:05.203
'cause they're like,
"Oh, I saw that video of you, where, like,

1:01:05.286 --> 1:01:07.246
your dog stuck its mouth
in your mouth.

1:01:07.330 --> 1:01:10.792
That was hilarious. Sorry, you're reading
for this role? Sorry? What?"

1:01:10.875 --> 1:01:14.337
And then they don't wanna--
they don't see you as an actor

1:01:14.420 --> 1:01:16.464
and I'm like, "No, no! I've done,
thousands of plays!"

1:01:16.547 --> 1:01:18.633
They're like, "Oh no, no! That's cool.
What about that video

1:01:18.716 --> 1:01:21.094
where your dog farted
in your mouth? That was good."

1:01:22.428 --> 1:01:24.138
Now it's like...

1:01:25.431 --> 1:01:26.766
Yeah, I'm that Vine girl.

1:01:28.518 --> 1:01:30.561
[Kirill]  A couple hit me up,
like a guy and a girl.

1:01:31.145 --> 1:01:32.105
I texted them.

1:01:32.188 --> 1:01:33.606
Let's hope they show up.

1:01:37.485 --> 1:01:39.278
-What's up, buddy? Kirill.
-What's up, man?

1:01:39.362 --> 1:01:40.655
-Dakota. How are you?
-How are ya?

1:01:40.738 --> 1:01:42.407
-This is Alexis.
-How are ya? Kirill.

1:01:42.490 --> 1:01:43.908
-Who's getting tattooed?
-Both.

1:01:43.991 --> 1:01:44.867
What are you thinking?

1:01:44.951 --> 1:01:47.537
I'm thinking literally what you write,
what you do with the sharpie?

1:01:47.620 --> 1:01:49.622
I usually write "slutwhisperer."

1:01:49.914 --> 1:01:53.209
But I think that's a terrible thing
to put on someone's body, honestly.

1:01:53.751 --> 1:01:56.045
-Okay.
-Unless, you're cool with it?

1:01:56.170 --> 1:01:57.797
I mean, that's what we thought
it would be.

1:01:57.880 --> 1:01:59.590
-Fine, let's do it.
-I don't want Kirill on my ass.

1:01:59.674 --> 1:02:01.050
[Kirill] So let's do slutwhisperer.

1:02:01.884 --> 1:02:04.846
I haven't even fucking written this sober
in God knows how long.

1:02:06.347 --> 1:02:08.558
[tattoo machine buzzing]

1:02:09.100 --> 1:02:13.646
-Is this your first couples' tattoo?
-First couples' butt cheek tattoo. Yeah.

1:02:13.730 --> 1:02:15.481
And you guys have been together
how long?

1:02:15.565 --> 1:02:16.524
Like officially?

1:02:18.526 --> 1:02:21.571
Ten days? Obviously you guys
are gonna be together forever.

1:02:21.654 --> 1:02:24.282
Like, this could be
a thing you tell your grandkids one day.

1:02:24.365 --> 1:02:26.284
I better get an invite to the wedding.

1:02:28.411 --> 1:02:29.454
[girl] Yeah, it looks good.

1:02:30.705 --> 1:02:31.539
[laughs]

1:02:31.622 --> 1:02:32.957
Just get a little closer together.

1:02:33.458 --> 1:02:34.292
Perfect.

1:02:34.375 --> 1:02:35.835
-You guys coming to the party?
-Fuck yeah.

1:02:37.003 --> 1:02:38.504
It's America's future right there.

1:02:39.422 --> 1:02:42.341
You think that relationship's gonna last?
Ten days they've been together.

1:02:42.425 --> 1:02:44.093
Nineteen and 21 years old.

1:02:44.844 --> 1:02:49.474
It's weird seeing someone just, like,
really into me, like that. You know?

1:02:58.566 --> 1:03:00.276
It's the slut whisperer!

1:03:00.610 --> 1:03:01.444
What up?

1:03:02.528 --> 1:03:05.782
Technically, you're not supposed to
blow into this, until 20 minutes after

1:03:05.865 --> 1:03:08.409
your last drink, because you have
so much alcohol on your breath,

1:03:08.493 --> 1:03:10.661
it'll literally register,
like, you're dead.

1:03:10.912 --> 1:03:13.331
-What up!
-Oh, girlies!

1:03:13.414 --> 1:03:14.582
-Hi, guys!
-Oh, wow.

1:03:14.665 --> 1:03:16.501
-I brought you a present.
-Thank you.

1:03:17.210 --> 1:03:19.003
-Got some Jamo.
-We know you're a what.

1:03:19.086 --> 1:03:20.838
They know how to make my dick soft.

1:03:21.339 --> 1:03:24.383
I got over 250 DMs
the first time we hung out

1:03:24.467 --> 1:03:27.887
because you said I bleached my butthole
and put my Instagram name.

1:03:28.763 --> 1:03:30.932
[Kirill]
There's just so many girls at the parties.

1:03:31.015 --> 1:03:32.934
They're like, "Oh!"
You already know, like, "Okay.

1:03:33.184 --> 1:03:35.186
She's going to want to have sex with me."

1:03:36.062 --> 1:03:38.856
I'm gonna wanna have sex with her.
We might as well have already done it.

1:03:40.441 --> 1:03:41.275
It's just fun.

1:03:41.859 --> 1:03:45.238
You get to hit someone with a hard dick.
It'll knock their teeth out.

1:03:45.321 --> 1:03:47.156
This girl that I met at a party,

1:03:47.240 --> 1:03:49.992
we're having sex, and she just stops
and looks at me,

1:03:50.284 --> 1:03:52.745
"You know, I've never fucked
a celebrity before."

1:03:52.870 --> 1:03:56.791
And I just, literally, never wanted
to die more in my life than that moment.

1:03:57.208 --> 1:03:58.668
It's just so, like, how...

1:03:59.460 --> 1:04:02.463
like that's your existence.
Like that's a goal.

1:04:03.422 --> 1:04:05.883
And me, of all people, like,
"Honey, you think--"

1:04:07.802 --> 1:04:10.471
Then to realize you're just as guilty
as everybody else.

1:04:10.555 --> 1:04:13.140
I will shit all over all these girls
that're like, "Oh, my God,

1:04:13.224 --> 1:04:15.601
celebrity blah, blah."
And then they fuck me for the story,

1:04:15.685 --> 1:04:16.894
but I do the same thing.

1:04:17.061 --> 1:04:18.437
So, I'm just as guilty.

1:04:20.982 --> 1:04:23.568
I don't like being alone, I've realized.
I just don't.

1:04:23.651 --> 1:04:26.863
I'm one of those people that I constantly
would like to have a friend on the couch.

1:04:27.530 --> 1:04:29.824
'Cause I don't like to be
alone with my thoughts.

1:04:29.949 --> 1:04:31.868
I think I go into, like, dark places.

1:04:35.371 --> 1:04:37.498
All these people love you
when you go out,

1:04:39.125 --> 1:04:41.544
and then you go home to your hotel room
and you're just like...

1:04:41.836 --> 1:04:43.421
dreading the next city you gotta go to.

1:04:50.469 --> 1:04:53.222
You think any grown man
of 33 years old

1:04:53.306 --> 1:04:54.932
is doing this somewhere else
on the planet?

1:04:59.478 --> 1:05:02.064
It's difficult when you have
five nights of partying in a row

1:05:02.148 --> 1:05:04.817
and you have to get on an airplane,
go across the country.

1:05:06.402 --> 1:05:08.070
And then give people the same energy.

1:05:09.322 --> 1:05:10.531
Every night.

1:05:13.618 --> 1:05:16.370
It's strenuous to have
any real relationship with someone.

1:05:17.330 --> 1:05:18.664
I want a family.

1:05:19.790 --> 1:05:21.834
I don't know if I'll be married
in five years,

1:05:21.918 --> 1:05:24.629
but, yeah, I don't wanna be
that guy that's, like,

1:05:24.712 --> 1:05:26.130
that people feel sad for.

1:05:26.213 --> 1:05:28.799
Even though they don't, 'cause they're
like, "Oh, you live the crazy life!"

1:05:28.883 --> 1:05:31.135
But they don't realize that I look
at their lives and I'm like,

1:05:31.677 --> 1:05:33.095
"That's kinda cool, too.

1:05:33.262 --> 1:05:34.889
That you, like, built something.

1:05:35.056 --> 1:05:37.558
Like I haven't built, like, shit."

1:05:38.851 --> 1:05:42.688
You know? Like, outside of this world.

1:05:43.481 --> 1:05:44.565
[groans]

1:05:44.941 --> 1:05:47.151
That's why I can't go to bed sober.

1:05:48.152 --> 1:05:51.530
'Cause I just sit there and think about
all this shit and argue with myself.

1:05:51.781 --> 1:05:54.033
I have to be, like,
really exhausted to fall asleep.

1:06:03.501 --> 1:06:06.087
[Matthew]  The end game for these people,
I think, is gonna be sad.

1:06:06.712 --> 1:06:08.673
They're in the spotlight,
but when it's done,

1:06:08.756 --> 1:06:12.551
it's done and they're not equipped to do
anything else in life. Where do you go?

1:06:12.635 --> 1:06:15.054
So, you're getting paid
however many thousands of dollars

1:06:15.137 --> 1:06:18.015
to show up and pour champagne
on some chick's boobs,

1:06:18.140 --> 1:06:19.475
but what happens when you're 50

1:06:19.558 --> 1:06:21.978
and no one wants you pouring champagne
anywhere on them?

1:06:22.061 --> 1:06:23.479
Or even, like, breathing on them?

1:06:23.771 --> 1:06:26.190
All hail the slut whisperer.

1:06:27.650 --> 1:06:30.444
[Matthew]  Everything on the internet
is eternal. These are the images

1:06:30.528 --> 1:06:33.656
that are burned in our brain,
so for you to recreate yourself,

1:06:33.739 --> 1:06:34.824
it's very difficult.

1:06:35.199 --> 1:06:38.202
[Josh]  Unless you are Paris Hilton,
you can't just reinvent yourself.

1:06:38.452 --> 1:06:42.915
She set the bar so low
in terms of, like, what people thought

1:06:42.999 --> 1:06:45.042
that she was capable of
and then it was like, "Oh my God!

1:06:45.543 --> 1:06:49.213
I accidentally started
15 perfume lines in Dubai."

1:06:49.296 --> 1:06:51.424
Can you horrify my viewers now?

1:06:51.507 --> 1:06:56.178
Tell them how much the last fragrance,
16th, Dazzle,

1:06:56.262 --> 1:06:57.888
how much it took in sales?

1:06:57.972 --> 1:07:01.017
I have 19 different product lines.
Dog clothes,

1:07:01.100 --> 1:07:03.477
haircare, makeup...

1:07:04.353 --> 1:07:07.189
sunglasses, handbags,

1:07:07.273 --> 1:07:09.817
clothing, fragrances.

1:07:11.277 --> 1:07:14.405
Every product you can think of, I make.

1:07:14.488 --> 1:07:16.198
Oh my God, you collected all of them?

1:07:16.282 --> 1:07:17.408
Look at that.

1:07:18.242 --> 1:07:19.452
There you go. Okay?

1:07:20.995 --> 1:07:22.121
Let's try another one.

1:07:22.204 --> 1:07:23.831
[laughter]

1:07:24.248 --> 1:07:26.375
Hit me. Oh wow.

1:07:26.459 --> 1:07:28.044
-How good is that smell?
-That shit's--

1:07:28.127 --> 1:07:29.920
[Josh]  You think you understand
what she's doing,

1:07:30.004 --> 1:07:31.672
and then she'll become a DJ
and you're like,

1:07:31.756 --> 1:07:33.841
"Oh, groan, she's gonna become a DJ."

1:07:33.924 --> 1:07:38.262
Next thing you know, she's DJing
on a floating zero-gravity stage

1:07:38.345 --> 1:07:41.432
for the Sultan of Brunei and
his three thousand falcons.

1:07:41.515 --> 1:07:43.267
One, two...

1:07:44.143 --> 1:07:45.603
Okay, we are live.

1:07:45.936 --> 1:07:48.189
It's me, the queen Paris Hilton. Yup.

1:07:48.272 --> 1:07:49.398
[laughter]

1:07:50.191 --> 1:07:52.735
-[Josh] Turn up the clea--
-Sorry. I just came out with my new, uh,

1:07:52.818 --> 1:07:54.403
Paris Hilton push-up bra line.

1:07:54.570 --> 1:07:56.530
So before we mention
our other project...

1:07:56.614 --> 1:07:58.616
-Right, let's talk about--
-...I'm mentioning this one.

1:07:58.699 --> 1:08:01.535
-Let's talk about phenomenal cleavage.
-And yeah, they're real.

1:08:01.619 --> 1:08:04.872
[laughter] Also they're real. Um...

1:08:04.955 --> 1:08:07.833
Okay, we, uh, we're here today--
today is special.

1:08:07.917 --> 1:08:09.752
Today is, like, a big-- it's a big day

1:08:09.835 --> 1:08:11.796
because we've been working on this
for a long time.

1:08:11.879 --> 1:08:15.091
I've been up on fake news for years.
You know, creating fake news stories,

1:08:15.174 --> 1:08:16.842
running them onto Twitter, and, like,

1:08:16.926 --> 1:08:20.054
basically seeing how they actually play
into the real world,

1:08:20.137 --> 1:08:23.057
was something that I feel proud
to have somewhat pioneered.

1:08:23.140 --> 1:08:25.726
And that went for everything to products,
I remember, um,

1:08:25.810 --> 1:08:27.895
a bunch of years ago
I invented a Louboutin shoe

1:08:27.978 --> 1:08:29.396
that was made of dehydrated kale.

1:08:29.480 --> 1:08:31.398
And I got someone
at  Huffington Post  to run it

1:08:31.482 --> 1:08:33.359
and, you know, this site
and that site to run it.

1:08:33.442 --> 1:08:35.861
Next thing you know, Louboutin's getting
hundreds of calls from people,

1:08:36.112 --> 1:08:39.031
being like, "Where can we buy
the fucking dehydrated kale shoe?"

1:08:39.323 --> 1:08:42.493
And that was straight-up fake news.
I can immediately call,

1:08:42.576 --> 1:08:46.622
you know, somebody I knew at whatever site
I knew had traffic and say,

1:08:46.705 --> 1:08:50.167
"This is funny. Wink wink. I want
you on the inside. Don't tell anybody."

1:08:50.251 --> 1:08:53.087
And run a story about
how I'm getting breast implants.

1:08:53.379 --> 1:08:57.091
It doesn't matter whether I'm ever gonna
get them or not. It just becomes reality.

1:08:57.174 --> 1:08:59.844
The internet and real life
are like careening towa--

1:08:59.927 --> 1:09:02.596
This is the internet. This is reality.

1:09:02.721 --> 1:09:05.474
They were just, like,
careening towards each other

1:09:05.558 --> 1:09:06.809
to become one.

1:09:07.726 --> 1:09:10.563
When I met Paris, I started thinking,
"What can we do that's, like,

1:09:10.646 --> 1:09:13.149
you know, not too ridiculous
and over-the-top that, like,

1:09:13.232 --> 1:09:14.066
you know, like...

1:09:14.150 --> 1:09:16.152
we can really fool people
and troll them and,

1:09:16.235 --> 1:09:17.987
get people to think
that it's fucking true.”

1:09:19.363 --> 1:09:20.906
Look at all of these baby DJs.

1:09:20.990 --> 1:09:22.283
This is a huge market now.

1:09:24.034 --> 1:09:25.536
[record scratches]

1:09:25.619 --> 1:09:29.540
Paris is a sick DJ and, like,
does parties in Ibiza for children.

1:09:29.874 --> 1:09:32.376
So, like, a lot of this
actually makes sense.

1:09:32.459 --> 1:09:35.004
Okay, we've been working on this
for a long time.

1:09:35.087 --> 1:09:37.339
-You must know child DJs.
-I actually do.

1:09:37.756 --> 1:09:40.551
There are a lot of baby DJs now,

1:09:40.634 --> 1:09:43.095
but here's the thing,
no one has anything to wear.

1:09:43.179 --> 1:09:44.972
Like, look,
this kid's having a great time.

1:09:45.055 --> 1:09:47.183
There are kinda, like,
lasers coming out of his hands,

1:09:47.266 --> 1:09:48.726
but look at your man's outfit.

1:09:48.809 --> 1:09:50.811
Who knows what kinda options
you have to go party?

1:09:50.895 --> 1:09:52.938
You haven't had that many, until now.

1:09:53.439 --> 1:09:57.359
Bottle Service. Bottle Service is a line
of clothing and accessories

1:09:57.443 --> 1:10:00.279
for these baby DJs and for these kids
who are going to parties.

1:10:01.697 --> 1:10:03.282
"Fuck milk, gimmie bass."

1:10:03.741 --> 1:10:04.575
Fire.

1:10:04.658 --> 1:10:07.077
This one is an homage
to really all the women...

1:10:07.620 --> 1:10:09.246
who have slept with Diplo.

1:10:09.330 --> 1:10:12.625
Who else is doing this?
No one. No one.

1:10:13.000 --> 1:10:15.252
-Peace out.
-Bottle Service.

1:10:15.836 --> 1:10:17.504
So we just did an Instagram Live,

1:10:17.963 --> 1:10:21.634
and 2.72 million people tuned in.

1:10:22.009 --> 1:10:24.929
Someone just tweeted a "yaaas"
at both of us that has,

1:10:25.012 --> 1:10:28.682
I'm not kidding you, 95 S's.

1:10:29.350 --> 1:10:33.604
It's just like, "Yaassssssss."

1:10:33.687 --> 1:10:35.272
[laughter]

1:10:35.356 --> 1:10:38.692
The comments are just fucking popping.
There're literally thousands of comments.

1:10:38.776 --> 1:10:40.236
"Will you ship to Taipei?"

1:10:40.319 --> 1:10:42.363
Someone said they want ten of them.

1:10:42.446 --> 1:10:43.906
-The bottles.
-Ten bottles...

1:10:43.989 --> 1:10:46.242
But they said they don't have a baby.
They want it for themselves.

1:10:46.325 --> 1:10:47.576
[Josh laughs]

1:10:47.660 --> 1:10:49.328
-That's so--
-That's so dope.

1:10:49.411 --> 1:10:52.456
-Like, people going to clubs with bottles.
-They're definitely in Germany. Yeah.

1:10:52.539 --> 1:10:55.000
They're like, "We love"...
Yeah, 'cause German people are, like,

1:10:55.084 --> 1:10:56.627
breast-feeding each other
in nightclubs.

1:10:56.710 --> 1:10:58.837
And they're definitely--
with baby bottles and diapers.

1:10:58.921 --> 1:11:00.047
We gotta do diapers.

1:11:00.798 --> 1:11:02.591
Glow-in-the-dark diapers?!

1:11:04.510 --> 1:11:06.512
["Turn You On" by Paris Hilton playing]

1:11:07.680 --> 1:11:10.140
What's crazy about this is not only
can we tell people that we're doing this

1:11:10.224 --> 1:11:14.019
and actually fool them and get stories
written from credible places that, like,

1:11:14.103 --> 1:11:16.897
won't do any research
and will just believe it 'cause we say it,

1:11:16.981 --> 1:11:19.775
but also, there's a very real chance

1:11:19.858 --> 1:11:21.819
that people start
demanding this product,

1:11:21.902 --> 1:11:24.363
and that we actually need to
start producing it and selling it.

1:11:24.446 --> 1:11:25.864
Is the website up?

1:11:25.948 --> 1:11:28.284
-The website's up--
-But what if people are gonna make orders

1:11:28.367 --> 1:11:30.744
and it's gonna be fake,
and they're gonna say we're a scam.

1:11:30.828 --> 1:11:31.829
That'd be dope.

1:11:32.037 --> 1:11:33.247
No, we'll make more--

1:11:33.330 --> 1:11:34.373
[laughter]

1:11:36.417 --> 1:11:38.335
I feel real good about this project.

1:11:38.419 --> 1:11:40.421
Once you sign off, it's a go.

1:11:40.504 --> 1:11:43.507
I talked to the attorneys.
I've talked to your lawyer.

1:11:43.632 --> 1:11:47.094
We got your royalties.
I'm grateful for you working with me.

1:11:47.177 --> 1:11:48.679
[Jimmy Kimmel]  He is four months old,

1:11:48.762 --> 1:11:51.640
and he is the executive producer
of this song?

1:11:51.724 --> 1:11:54.143
Yes, he's in the studio,
listening to the songs with me,

1:11:54.226 --> 1:11:57.021
going over if the beats are right,
if the energy's right.

1:11:57.104 --> 1:11:58.939
If he's not in the studio
while we're recording,

1:11:59.023 --> 1:12:01.025
I FaceTime him and put him
on the phone with an artist.

1:12:01.108 --> 1:12:04.278
Thank you for executive producing
my album, I appreciate that.

1:12:04.361 --> 1:12:06.363
My son is the executive producer,

1:12:06.447 --> 1:12:08.615
not only of this song with me,
Beyoncé and Jay-Z,

1:12:08.699 --> 1:12:10.075
but also my new album,

1:12:10.159 --> 1:12:11.785
top ten record in the country
in three weeks,

1:12:11.869 --> 1:12:14.163
-soon to be number one.
-[audience whooping]

1:12:14.246 --> 1:12:15.706
We're on your album, buddy.

1:12:15.789 --> 1:12:16.999
Thank you for having me!

1:12:17.499 --> 1:12:18.334
I love you!

1:12:18.417 --> 1:12:21.879
You a don. You a icon. You a legend.

1:12:21.962 --> 1:12:24.715
Yo, that's a shot, boy! That's a shot!

1:12:29.720 --> 1:12:31.972
I just keep building my brand,
We The Best.

1:12:32.139 --> 1:12:35.434
Know what I'm saying?
"We The Best" is not just a name.

1:12:35.601 --> 1:12:38.145
You know what I'm saying?
It's just not a cool thing to say.

1:12:38.228 --> 1:12:39.313
It's a lifestyle.

1:12:39.772 --> 1:12:41.774
Asahd, you have lights on your rims?!

1:12:41.982 --> 1:12:43.817
And you got all these sneakers?!

1:12:44.151 --> 1:12:46.153
Yes, you got the new Jordans?

1:12:46.236 --> 1:12:48.572
Make sure there's a short enough sleeve
for his Rolex.

1:12:48.739 --> 1:12:50.532
[woman]
These moments on Snapchat, though.

1:12:50.949 --> 1:12:52.826
I'm sure he's not just giving them.

1:12:54.411 --> 1:12:58.123
Um, are good business for Khaled.
But where do you stop?

1:12:59.375 --> 1:13:00.542
I am a hustler.

1:13:01.126 --> 1:13:02.920
To this day, I'm still hustling.

1:13:03.128 --> 1:13:04.880
You know what I'm saying.
When I say hustle,

1:13:04.963 --> 1:13:08.842
you know, everything I do,
whatever it takes to survive.

1:13:12.638 --> 1:13:15.641
[Kirill]  Saturday night, I slept an hour.
Sunday, I slept two hours,

1:13:15.724 --> 1:13:17.518
and then Monday, I slept four.

1:13:17.601 --> 1:13:18.685
And then I posted that...

1:13:20.020 --> 1:13:21.647
I wanted to kill myself at the time.

1:13:23.524 --> 1:13:25.317
A lot of people were hitting me up.
They're like,

1:13:25.401 --> 1:13:27.361
"Don't kill yourself yet.
I still have yet to party with you."

I'm like, "Thanks. You really care
about my well-being."

1:13:30.072 --> 1:13:31.615
It's really just a self-centered--

1:13:31.698 --> 1:13:34.451
"I just wanna get drunk with Kirill
one time. Then, you can kill yourself."

1:13:34.993 --> 1:13:36.078
They don't even talk to you.

1:13:36.161 --> 1:13:38.205
They're just like,
"Oh, can I get on the Snapchat?"

1:13:38.288 --> 1:13:40.207
That's when you feel like a zoo animal.

1:14:20.873 --> 1:14:22.875
-Some drastic shit.
-And some sacrifice,

Yeah, who gives a shit?
Yup, nobody cares.

1:16:41.930 --> 1:16:44.308
I always used to ask my dad,
"Why did you marry Mom?"

1:16:45.517 --> 1:16:48.103
'Cause it seemed, like,
my whole childhood, I'm telling you,

1:16:48.186 --> 1:16:50.772
I never saw a moment of
when my parents were, like,

1:16:50.897 --> 1:16:52.566
hugging or loving to each other.

1:16:52.649 --> 1:16:53.817
Not one moment.

1:16:55.235 --> 1:16:57.571
My parents got divorced
when I was six.

1:16:57.946 --> 1:17:01.116
My dad didn't fight with my mom,
my mom fought with my dad.

1:17:01.450 --> 1:17:03.660
Oh, my God, this was when my Mom
was a witch on Halloween,

1:17:03.744 --> 1:17:06.371
but this is what my Mom would
literally look like when she was angry.

1:17:08.915 --> 1:17:12.044
One time my parents got in a fight
and I came downstairs,

1:17:13.045 --> 1:17:14.254
and my mom had a knife,

1:17:14.338 --> 1:17:17.090
and was chasing my dad
around the kitchen table with a knife.

1:17:17.466 --> 1:17:19.384
And she kept telling me
to go upstairs,

1:17:19.468 --> 1:17:23.347
so that I wouldn't see anything
and my dad kept telling me to go upstairs.

1:17:25.724 --> 1:17:28.226

There were times where
she couldn't breathe.

1:17:40.238 --> 1:17:41.615
She would be holding her chest,

1:17:41.698 --> 1:17:45.285
so I took her over to the hospital
and they would check her out and say,

1:17:45.369 --> 1:17:47.371
"She's just having anxiety."

1:17:49.206 --> 1:17:51.750
It would happen at least
maybe once a week.

For a while, I would take her
to the hospital no matter what.

And then, at some point
in high school, you know,

1:17:58.715 --> 1:18:01.802
I got a call from the school nurse
and told me that, you know,

1:18:01.885 --> 1:18:05.263

enough strength to do it.

of my entire life.

This White Girl rosé thing was
supposed to be kind of a joke.

1:22:39.704 --> 1:22:42.624
There was a rosé shortage
in the Hamptons, two summers ago.

1:22:42.707 --> 1:22:44.668
The New York Post was like,
"Rosé shortage!"

1:22:44.751 --> 1:22:46.252
Like, "People are freaking out!"

1:22:46.378 --> 1:22:49.756

We were gonna make
10,000 bottles of it,

1:23:35.552 --> 1:23:37.429
And a bottle of alcohol.
Any type of alcohol.

1:23:38.138 --> 1:23:41.516
I don't unscrew the hairection at night,
put it down and listen to NPR,

1:23:41.599 --> 1:23:43.810
and be like,
"Ah, long day as the Fat Jew."

1:23:43.977 --> 1:23:46.855
I'm into other stuff
that people didn't know that I was about

1:23:46.938 --> 1:23:49.899
and one of them was actually
building business.

1:23:51.026 --> 1:23:53.570
Pampering is the key to youth, Josh.

1:23:54.029 --> 1:23:57.782
When I'm feeling low,
I just spray my face with rose mist spray.

1:23:57.866 --> 1:23:59.868
I do the exact same thing.

1:23:59.951 --> 1:24:03.329
I mist myself with rosé. All day long.

1:24:03.413 --> 1:24:04.956
Josh, that's fucking rosé.

1:24:05.623 --> 1:24:06.958
It works though. I'm telling you.

1:24:07.042 --> 1:24:09.377
-I'm gonna put it in my mouth.
-Oh, this is nice.

1:24:09.919 --> 1:24:13.506
-Yes, bitch.
-Yes, bitch.

1:24:13.590 --> 1:24:16.426
The internet's fucking fickle.
Every day they want something new.

1:24:16.509 --> 1:24:18.553
It's a mob that demands new things.

1:24:18.803 --> 1:24:20.305
That's just how we are now.

1:24:20.388 --> 1:24:22.474
We're just like, "What's hot?
Someone make me laugh.

1:24:22.557 --> 1:24:23.850
Somebody do something awesome.

1:24:23.933 --> 1:24:25.393
Somebody be fucking crazy.

1:24:25.477 --> 1:24:28.563
Someone impress me." And, there was only
so long that I'd be the guy who

1:24:28.646 --> 1:24:31.274
could be able to do that. There was
gonna be someone to come and take my spot.

1:24:31.357 --> 1:24:33.276
So, I had to get something--
You know what I mean?

1:24:33.359 --> 1:24:36.071
I had to create something that I'd be able
to walk away with it, because

1:24:36.154 --> 1:24:38.156
my level of self-awareness
was high enough

1:24:38.239 --> 1:24:39.783
to know that in three years,
this wouldn't matter.

1:24:40.992 --> 1:24:43.369
We just partnered with Anheuser-Busch.

1:24:43.453 --> 1:24:45.413
At this point, by distribution point,

1:24:45.497 --> 1:24:47.832
we're the best-selling canned rosé
in America.

1:24:48.708 --> 1:24:52.295
This'll really allow it to blanket
now the whole entire country.

1:24:52.629 --> 1:24:54.714
I am the embodiment
of the new American Dream.

1:24:54.798 --> 1:24:56.299
I'm the CEO of a wine company.

1:24:56.382 --> 1:24:58.259
And look, I'm not obnoxious about it.

1:24:58.718 --> 1:25:01.429
People think that the whole thing
just kind of fell into my lap.

1:25:01.513 --> 1:25:03.223
To be honest with you,
I don't really care.

1:25:03.306 --> 1:25:06.351
At the end of the day,
I'm doing better than most of them.

1:25:06.434 --> 1:25:08.895
The age of the
digital influencer is, like, it's--

1:25:08.978 --> 1:25:10.772
I'm telling you,
it's gonna fucking crash.

1:25:13.233 --> 1:25:14.442
Is that better?

1:25:14.526 --> 1:25:17.028
Okay, so, for those of you that follow me,

1:25:17.112 --> 1:25:19.906
I'm in Calabasas right now.
What the fuck? Like...

1:25:20.448 --> 1:25:22.784
I went from being the most
depressed piece of shit in the world

1:25:22.867 --> 1:25:23.993
to being super hap--

1:25:24.202 --> 1:25:26.329
I'm checking to see
if my boyfriend's coming.

1:25:26.412 --> 1:25:28.706
To being, like, super fucking happy.

1:25:29.958 --> 1:25:31.543
[male reporter]
In unexpected couple news,

1:25:31.626 --> 1:25:35.421
bad boy musician Tommy Lee is apparently
hooking up with former Vine star

1:25:35.505 --> 1:25:36.714
Brittany Furlan.

1:25:37.674 --> 1:25:39.217
[camera shutters clicking]

1:25:39.884 --> 1:25:43.847
Cameras caught the possible couple kissing
in Calabasas, California, last week.

1:25:45.640 --> 1:25:48.059
Of course, before that,
he was married to Heather Locklear,

1:25:48.143 --> 1:25:50.770
and Pamela Anderson,
with whom he shares two sons.

1:25:51.271 --> 1:25:54.691
Thirty-year-old Brittany wrapped her arms
around 53-year-old Tommy's neck,

1:25:54.774 --> 1:25:57.026
as he grabbed on to her backside.

1:25:58.528 --> 1:26:01.072
[music playing]

1:26:08.913 --> 1:26:12.876
[Tommy Lee]  I've been following her
for years on Vine.

1:26:12.959 --> 1:26:19.090
I was like, "She is so fuckin' funny,
and stupid and cute and beautiful."

1:26:19.174 --> 1:26:22.969
Mom, I want you to meet
my new boyfriend. This is Tommy.

1:26:23.052 --> 1:26:26.472
Oh, honey, I'm so glad to meet
your boyfriend, Tommy Lee Jo--

1:26:26.556 --> 1:26:29.559
This guy's not Tommy Lee Jones!
Who is this guy?

1:26:29.642 --> 1:26:32.145
He looks like a gang member! Is he
in a gang? Is he gonna get us killed?

1:26:32.228 --> 1:26:34.189
No, Mom, he's a musician.
He makes music.

1:26:34.272 --> 1:26:35.815
I mean, I guess it's not so bad.

1:26:35.899 --> 1:26:39.319
You just got the little nipply ding-dongs
and some tattoos.

1:26:39.402 --> 1:26:40.945
I guess I can let it go.

1:26:41.029 --> 1:26:42.989
Well, my dick is pierced too.

1:26:43.072 --> 1:26:44.073
[record scratch]

1:26:45.116 --> 1:26:48.286
It's just crazy because
I've never been in such a, like...

1:26:49.871 --> 1:26:54.500
positive fucking creative environment
in my whole life.

1:26:57.879 --> 1:27:01.507
I don't know why people think
that they have the right to say things

1:27:01.591 --> 1:27:03.301
about someone else's relationship.

1:27:05.220 --> 1:27:08.306
I literally lost 100,000 followers
on Instagram.

1:27:09.098 --> 1:27:11.142
People were just like,
"Oh, my God, you changed!"

1:27:11.226 --> 1:27:14.103
I'm like, "No, I didn't change.
Like, I just don't care."

1:27:15.480 --> 1:27:19.692
I stopped basing my happiness
on what other people thought of me.

1:27:20.860 --> 1:27:22.987
I met someone who I trust

1:27:23.071 --> 1:27:25.531
because I didn't trust anybody
that I've dated before.

1:27:26.282 --> 1:27:29.702
I'd say Tommy is my first true love,

1:27:30.161 --> 1:27:31.746
and I'm finally safe and happy.

1:27:31.829 --> 1:27:33.456
-Hold on.
-Do I have a booger?

1:27:33.539 --> 1:27:35.750
-I think you have a little boogie.
-No!

1:27:35.917 --> 1:27:37.877
-Baby, are you serious?
-Hold on. Yes.

1:27:38.002 --> 1:27:40.004
-No! Oh, God!
-It's right there.

1:27:40.088 --> 1:27:42.298
-Are you serious? You serious?
-Yes, hold it.

1:27:42.507 --> 1:27:46.010
No! Are you serious right now?
You're pulling a booger out of my nose.

1:27:47.220 --> 1:27:48.388
Ew!

1:27:48.471 --> 1:27:50.265
-You ate it!
-Yum.

1:27:51.683 --> 1:27:54.185
I'm the luckiest girl in the world.

1:28:05.863 --> 1:28:07.156
I'm still drunk.

1:28:09.284 --> 1:28:10.493
I'm gonna throw up.

1:28:11.160 --> 1:28:11.995
[coughs]

1:28:12.912 --> 1:28:14.205
Oh, God.

1:28:14.289 --> 1:28:16.541
I've been spitting blood
in the morning.

1:28:17.458 --> 1:28:20.545
Sometimes, I just spit
and I'll be like, "Oh, that's blood."

1:28:21.462 --> 1:28:24.048
Half my face went numb
and I thought I was dying.

1:28:24.841 --> 1:28:26.175
Head was pounding.

1:28:26.801 --> 1:28:28.678
I black out a lot.

1:28:29.512 --> 1:28:31.306
Don't remember a lot of my nights.

1:28:32.557 --> 1:28:33.808
I did a lot of shots.

1:28:34.559 --> 1:28:35.727
Don't remember leaving.

1:28:37.895 --> 1:28:39.355
I don't remember getting here.

1:28:40.481 --> 1:28:42.900
I don't know what happened... at all.

1:28:45.445 --> 1:28:48.448
[electronic music playing, screaming]

1:28:53.369 --> 1:28:55.997
It's like punching a wall.
All your anger just comes out.

1:28:56.748 --> 1:28:59.459
I can't talk to people when I'm sober,
because I hate them

1:28:59.542 --> 1:29:01.336
and especially when they're drunk.

1:29:01.419 --> 1:29:03.171
Ever talk to a drunk person
when you're sober?

1:29:03.254 --> 1:29:06.466
You just wanna kill yourself.
So, I have to get on their level.

1:29:07.675 --> 1:29:10.428
Plenty of times I've wanted to
give up, be like, "I don't want to

1:29:10.511 --> 1:29:14.015
be viewed as this piece of shit
misogynist" but I was like, "Look...

1:29:14.515 --> 1:29:17.268
I do this 'cause this is all I can do."

1:29:17.477 --> 1:29:18.644
I have to pay my rent.

1:29:20.897 --> 1:29:24.150
I've always had that
weird ability to be...

1:29:25.234 --> 1:29:28.237
a lovable asshole.

1:29:31.157 --> 1:29:32.700
You can argue it's degrading.

1:29:34.744 --> 1:29:36.788
You can argue that we're having fun.

1:29:36.913 --> 1:29:38.247
That is poopy water!

1:29:38.915 --> 1:29:41.876
But we're animals. Just because
we're at the top of the food chain

1:29:41.959 --> 1:29:43.961
does not make us not animals.

1:29:47.090 --> 1:29:49.258
Slutwhisperer has taken over me.

1:29:50.510 --> 1:29:54.180
I think over time I've found a way
to have a split personality.

1:29:57.934 --> 1:29:59.519
Everyone gets old and ugly one day.

1:30:01.187 --> 1:30:05.024
You can just fuckin' drop dead
at any moment.

1:30:11.447 --> 1:30:13.366
I've been losing more followers lately...

1:30:14.283 --> 1:30:16.702
and that's fine with me.

1:30:17.078 --> 1:30:18.037
I don't care.

1:30:19.330 --> 1:30:20.998
It's all bullshit in the end.

1:30:22.417 --> 1:30:25.044
I just more think about
who's gonna show up at my funeral.

1:30:31.968 --> 1:30:34.137
[thrilling music playing]

1:30:38.724 --> 1:30:41.936
[Paris]  I was in a bra and underwear
with no shoes.

1:30:42.019 --> 1:30:43.604
It was freezing.

1:30:44.480 --> 1:30:46.941
I just remember being so nervous
before the scene,

1:30:47.024 --> 1:30:48.484
and almost having a panic attack.

1:30:51.070 --> 1:30:56.033
Because it's the first serious film
that I'd done, called  House of Wax.

1:30:57.535 --> 1:31:00.997
But then when I got on set,
I used all that nervousness

1:31:01.080 --> 1:31:03.082
and kind of, like,
used it for the character.

1:31:03.166 --> 1:31:04.041

1:31:32.069 --> 1:31:36.449
Then when they told me they were gonna
be using the tagline "See Paris Die,"

1:31:36.532 --> 1:31:38.534
and all of the promoting of it,

1:31:38.910 --> 1:31:42.330
they had my face as the whole billboard
and the whole campaign.

1:31:43.164 --> 1:31:45.541
Like, melting with the wax. Um...

1:31:47.293 --> 1:31:48.294
I don't know.

1:31:49.921 --> 1:31:51.964
My biggest fear is to die.

1:31:54.842 --> 1:31:57.053
Because I have no idea
what happens after.

1:31:57.637 --> 1:31:59.889
[fleshy squish]

1:32:00.181 --> 1:32:04.602

because that would be beyond boring.

1:32:16.322 --> 1:32:17.240
Alright.

1:32:21.410 --> 1:32:25.248
You want to keep these nice and flat
and give me separation in the fingers.

Perfect. Eyes on camera:
one, two, three.

1:32:29.544 --> 1:32:31.212

so nobody knows about it yet.

Cool. I think we got a nice batch.

I'm basically over going out in real life.

1:32:53.234 --> 1:32:55.861
So, I wanted to create a virtual world.

1:32:57.446 --> 1:33:00.074
It's really incredible
how much has changed.

1:33:00.449 --> 1:33:04.704
I could be in my living room and
I'm gonna have live streaming of me

1:33:04.787 --> 1:33:06.581
DJing and performing.

1:33:06.664 --> 1:33:07.582
It will be...

1:33:07.915 --> 1:33:11.002
just like being in a nightclub
in Ibiza or Las Vegas.

1:33:11.085 --> 1:33:14.714
A lot of people don't have the opportunity
to get to go to these places,

1:33:14.797 --> 1:33:17.883
so I really wanted to create something
where people can feel like

1:33:17.967 --> 1:33:19.302
they're in this fantasy world.

1:33:20.303 --> 1:33:24.015
Just to have a space to have
all my fans hang out, interact, dance,

1:33:24.098 --> 1:33:27.268
have a good time,
and escape from the world.

1:33:28.436 --> 1:33:31.939
People are being negative or coming in
and being trolls and haters.

1:33:32.023 --> 1:33:34.984
That's what the bouncer's for.
They'll just be thrown out.

1:33:36.527 --> 1:33:39.155
There's a reason that I am who I am.

1:33:39.572 --> 1:33:41.240
I already do have a legacy,

1:33:41.324 --> 1:33:44.577
but once you start that,
you just can't stop.

1:33:44.994 --> 1:33:47.622
It's just endless
what I could do with this platform.

1:33:47.705 --> 1:33:49.915
I could really control
the way people see me.

1:33:51.042 --> 1:33:55.838
A lot of people don't understand
that you need to be sustainable forever.
