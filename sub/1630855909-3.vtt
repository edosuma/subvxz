WEBVTT

00:04.713 --> 00:08.800
Before we move off this topic, can
I ask if you’re currently a hologram?

00:08.800 --> 00:10.427
Hold on. One sec.

00:11.553 --> 00:14.180
Left a bag of Funyuns
down there last week.

00:14.180 --> 00:17.016
Didn’t want to waste our time.
Okay, let’s do it. Therapy me.

00:19.853 --> 00:22.355
- Do you need to take that?
- No. Just the President.

00:22.689 --> 00:25.817
- Maybe we should turn off the phone.
- President of the United States.

00:25.817 --> 00:26.943
Thought you might think that was cool.

00:26.943 --> 00:28.903
You like it when people
think you’re cool?

00:28.903 --> 00:30.280
You’re extra analytical today.

00:30.280 --> 00:33.616
- Looking to remodel your kitchen?
<i>- Sanchez! I know you’re in there!</i>

00:34.868 --> 00:37.162
When I call you directly
it’s an emergency.

00:37.162 --> 00:39.330
I was in therapy.
Don’t stigmatize mental health.

00:39.330 --> 00:41.166
How rude of me. Hello,

00:41.166 --> 00:43.585
- I’m President Andre Curtis.
- Yes, I recognize you.

00:43.585 --> 00:44.794
Oh? How nice.

00:44.794 --> 00:47.714
It’s not nice to recognize a president,
can we go?

00:48.590 --> 00:53.762
In 1961, the CIA secretly relocated
the Loch Ness Monster to Lake Erie

00:53.762 --> 00:55.638
and replaced her bones with titanium.

00:55.638 --> 00:57.849
She was then bit by several werewolves,

00:57.849 --> 00:59.934
giving us the ultimate
anti-submarine weapon.

00:59.934 --> 01:00.769
Got it.

01:00.769 --> 01:02.645
But the Soviets smuggled
in a leprechaun,

01:02.645 --> 01:06.566
who turned Nessie’s bones to silver,
giving her the were-version of AIDS.

01:06.566 --> 01:08.860
She sank to the bottom
and we assumed she was dead.

01:08.860 --> 01:12.447
But she was only asleep.
Now she’s awake... and hungry.

01:12.447 --> 01:13.531
You can’t date my shrink.

01:13.948 --> 01:16.826
- What? Bro, you’re nuts.
- Then don’t date my shrink.

01:17.327 --> 01:18.661
I’m not dating your shrink!

01:19.704 --> 01:21.122
She probably doesn’t even like me.

01:21.539 --> 01:23.625
- Stand down, Sanchez!
- Tell him to stand down!

01:23.625 --> 01:26.294
- Would you let him bang your therapist?
- I don’t believe in therapy!

01:26.836 --> 01:29.506
What the hell does that even mean,
you don’t believe in it?

01:29.506 --> 01:31.508
- He’s a scientologist.
- Don’t date my shrink!

01:31.508 --> 01:33.551
- And don’t be a Space Mormon!
- Why not?

01:33.551 --> 01:34.552
It’s silly!

01:35.053 --> 01:36.471
Sorry, it’s a cheap shot.

01:36.971 --> 01:37.889
Worship how you want.

01:39.098 --> 01:40.809
- I like Tom Cruise.
- Thank you.

01:41.267 --> 01:43.019
- Therapy’s working.
- Keep it in your pants.

02:17.011 --> 02:19.722
<i>Welcome back to Mr. Stabby!</i>

02:20.139 --> 02:22.058
<i>Let’s get another question
from the audience!</i>

02:24.018 --> 02:26.104
Why do people
get tickets to his tapings?

02:26.104 --> 02:27.522
It’s a fame-obsessed culture.

02:29.315 --> 02:31.234
- Mr. President.
<i>- I’ve got an emergency, Rick.</i>

02:31.234 --> 02:32.694
Another President mission?

02:32.694 --> 02:34.779
You just killed
the Loch Ness Monster for him.

02:34.779 --> 02:37.198
<i>-Tell that little bitch to zip it.</i>
- You can’t talk to me like that!

02:37.198 --> 02:39.075
Tell him he can’t talk
to me like that...

02:39.075 --> 02:40.577
- You can’t talk to Morty like that.
<i>- Whatever.</i>

02:40.577 --> 02:41.619
I’ll portal over.

02:42.495 --> 02:44.622
I’ve seen this one anyway.
The audience dies.

02:47.792 --> 02:48.877
Rick, thanks for coming.

02:49.252 --> 02:51.129
We’ve got a situation
in the state of Virginia.

02:51.129 --> 02:52.755
- Bigfoot.
- That’s Montana.

02:52.755 --> 02:55.049
- Nazis.
- That’s... everywhere.

02:55.049 --> 02:56.259
That’s an exaggeration, sir.

02:57.051 --> 02:58.720
Jesus, Carl, you too?

02:59.137 --> 03:01.639
The problem in Virginia is... love.

03:02.098 --> 03:04.434
You’ve heard the state motto,
"Virginia is for Lovers"?

03:04.434 --> 03:06.519
Well, now they’ve codified it into law.

03:06.853 --> 03:10.481
Virginia has declared itself
literally and exclusively for lovers.

03:10.899 --> 03:12.734
- Sounds boring.
- It gets worse.

03:12.734 --> 03:16.321
There’s no crime, no poverty,
and suspiciously, no complaints.

03:16.321 --> 03:19.449
The governor just hit
a hundred percent roval rating.

03:19.449 --> 03:21.784
- And that’s worse?
- A hundred percent?

03:21.784 --> 03:23.077
Get on the web, Dwayne,

03:23.077 --> 03:25.121
there’s no such thing
as a hundred percent of anything.

03:25.538 --> 03:27.999
America knows and incinerates
a cult when it sees one.

03:29.000 --> 03:32.086
But I can’t do that to all of Virginia,
so we need to infiltrate.

03:32.086 --> 03:34.172
I volunteer to do acid
to prove I’m not a cop.

03:34.172 --> 03:35.340
No lone wolves.

03:35.340 --> 03:38.301
We need a crack team for this one.
Rick, meet Fleeflak.

03:38.843 --> 03:40.970
- He might be able to tell the future.
- Might?

03:40.970 --> 03:43.640
We’re waiting to find out.
Onyx here is a weapons specialist,

03:43.640 --> 03:46.684
and our eye in the sky’s
my chief of staff bot, Chi-Chi.

03:46.684 --> 03:48.686
- Sleek.
- Yes, an excellent team.

03:49.228 --> 03:50.647
But there’s something missing...

03:51.564 --> 03:54.067
- A psychology expert, perhaps.
- Fuck me!

03:54.067 --> 03:56.861
You pretended to need a crack team
so you could get Wong’s number?

03:56.861 --> 03:57.987
Get her number?

03:57.987 --> 04:01.074
I own the CIA,
if I wanted I could get her genome .

04:01.074 --> 04:03.743
So you wanted what from me, permission?
You got it.

04:03.743 --> 04:05.912
It’s a free country,
so you’re always saying.

04:05.912 --> 04:07.664
That’s certainly
all I’d be willing to pay.

04:07.664 --> 04:09.666
You’re making me choose?
You or her?

04:10.083 --> 04:13.294
There’s three billion women on this
planet that have nothing to do with me.

04:13.670 --> 04:15.505
- Can you blame them?
- You suck.

04:15.505 --> 04:20.009
- Wait! Danger!
- Wow that’s great, buddy.

04:20.009 --> 04:21.803
It’s goin’ right on the fridge.

04:26.641 --> 04:29.727
I appreciate your lending your expertise
to this mission, Doctor Wong.

04:30.186 --> 04:31.354
- Gun?
- No thank you.

04:31.813 --> 04:34.732
I was surprised to receive your call,
but excited.

04:34.732 --> 04:37.026
I haven’t done field
work since grad school.

04:37.026 --> 04:41.030
We think the people of Virginia
have become some kind of hippy sex cult.

04:41.030 --> 04:43.199
I haven’t done that since
grad school either.

04:44.158 --> 04:46.744
Doctor Wong, you are a firecracker!

04:46.744 --> 04:47.996
Sir, we’ve reached the border.

04:48.705 --> 04:49.622
Halt!

04:51.207 --> 04:54.627
I’m so sorry, Mr. President,
Virginia is closed to visitors.

04:54.627 --> 04:55.962
I thought it was for lovers.

04:56.337 --> 04:57.922
I’m a lover.
You guys lovers?

04:58.798 --> 05:00.049
I appreciate that,

05:00.049 --> 05:03.886
but the rest of your country
doesn’t need Virginia’s love right now.

05:03.886 --> 05:06.431
You know, the last time
a state talked that way,

05:06.431 --> 05:09.058
- we had to have a whole thing.
- And?

05:09.642 --> 05:12.145
And this time
the other side has nukes.

05:13.980 --> 05:14.897
Let them in.

05:16.315 --> 05:18.443
- Well done, Doctor.
- Call me Helen.

05:25.241 --> 05:28.703
As you can see,
Virginia has no crime, no poverty.

05:28.703 --> 05:31.289
- All goods are freely given.
- Communist bastards.

05:31.289 --> 05:34.751
- And all goods are freely made.
- Communist bastards!

05:34.751 --> 05:36.753
So what happened? Tell me the secret.

05:36.753 --> 05:38.838
Well, if I tell you,
you’ll tell everyone.

05:39.464 --> 05:41.924
But if I show you, you won’t have to.

05:41.924 --> 05:43.718
How unsettling and cryptic of...

05:48.014 --> 05:49.640
My God, so that’s it?

05:49.640 --> 05:50.683
You’re all just drunk?

05:52.060 --> 05:54.645
Sir! It’s some kind
of body snatching hive-mind!

05:54.645 --> 05:56.439
Finally your religion comes in handy!

05:56.814 --> 05:59.192
No!
My only chance at meeting Will Smith!

06:05.323 --> 06:08.785
Pick up your phone, asshole,
when I call it’s an actual emergency!

06:10.661 --> 06:11.579
Rick?

06:12.205 --> 06:14.957
- Unity.
- Take it easy, take it easy...

06:14.957 --> 06:17.960
I can explain,
just let me get things under control.

06:17.960 --> 06:19.796
You controlling things
is the explanation

06:19.796 --> 06:21.839
and we agreed you wouldn’t
do it where I work.

06:23.633 --> 06:25.384
The fuck are you spraying me with?

06:26.052 --> 06:27.887
A new scent I picked up after you left.

06:27.887 --> 06:31.849
- I call it "Separation."
- You concocted a me repellent?

06:31.849 --> 06:33.601
Does that look like a bad idea?

06:35.311 --> 06:38.773
Rick, are you in a relationship
with the population of Virginia?

06:38.773 --> 06:39.774
We dated.

06:42.735 --> 06:44.195
I just want to talk.

06:44.195 --> 06:46.155
I’m pretty sure
you have trillions of cell phones.

06:46.781 --> 06:48.157
No, come back, let’s talk!

06:52.703 --> 06:54.455
Thank god you had a crack team with you.

06:54.455 --> 06:55.957
- Where’s Helen?
-"Helen?"

06:55.957 --> 06:57.208
She initiated first name...

06:59.585 --> 07:01.295
Call in a chopper!
I’m being cock blocked!

07:02.672 --> 07:04.841
Rick! It’s me.

07:05.299 --> 07:06.843
I was released from Unity.

07:06.843 --> 07:08.845
Cool, so you won’t mind if I spray this.

07:08.845 --> 07:12.807
Wel... I won’t, but we’re surrounded
and Unity knows your reload time.

07:13.474 --> 07:15.852
I really believe
you and Unity should talk.

07:16.227 --> 07:18.521
How would you know?
You’re just a nutritionist.

07:18.521 --> 07:22.191
When you work in nutritionism as long
as I have, you get a certain feel...

07:27.113 --> 07:29.949
Calm down.
We came because we’re worried about you.

07:30.449 --> 07:32.785
- Why?
- We hear things, Rick.

07:32.785 --> 07:35.830
I tried calling but...
is it true you’re looking for...

07:36.330 --> 07:37.373
him again?

07:37.707 --> 07:39.333
You almost died last time.

07:39.333 --> 07:41.961
- That’s none of your business.
- You’re our business.

07:41.961 --> 07:44.505
You quit that business!
And you’re fired from that business!

07:44.505 --> 07:46.007
And I’m using your last paycheck

07:46.007 --> 07:48.176
to cover the stapler you stole which
was my heart!

07:49.594 --> 07:50.720
Civil War, baby!

07:53.848 --> 07:55.725
Sorry.
That was supposed to be suppressive.

07:58.352 --> 07:59.812
Rick, wait!

08:02.315 --> 08:04.233
- Thank you, Andre.
- Thank you, Helen.

08:04.609 --> 08:06.527
It’s time to put these bastards on ice.

08:07.445 --> 08:08.988
- Cue up the dome!
- Yes sir!

08:31.719 --> 08:33.930
Do you have a dome
the size of every state?

08:35.681 --> 08:37.642
You’ll need a second date
for that answer.

08:37.642 --> 08:38.601
Barf.

08:40.353 --> 08:43.272
<i>A nation in turmoil tonight
as the entire state of Virginia</i>

08:43.272 --> 08:45.733
<i>continues to be trapped
inside an energy dome.</i>

08:46.359 --> 08:48.236
<i>The White House released
a statement dismissing</i>

08:48.236 --> 08:50.947
<i>the President’s shouts of
"Civil War, baby."</i>

08:50.947 --> 08:53.533
<i>as hyperbole.
Shonda, what do we make of that?</i>

08:53.533 --> 08:57.036
<i>- More like Hyper Bully, Tom.
- Shit. Shonda came to play.</i>

08:57.036 --> 09:00.539
<i>This President has been in office
for how many alien invasions?</i>

09:00.539 --> 09:02.041
<i>Not to mention the mutant turkeys,</i>

09:02.041 --> 09:03.960
<i>the abandoned White House
orbiting our planet,</i>

09:03.960 --> 09:05.544
<i>the eco-conscious dinosaurs...</i>

09:05.544 --> 09:06.671
Then he sees Virginia

09:06.671 --> 09:09.257
<i>with its perfect economy
and synchronized lawn mowing,</i>

09:09.257 --> 09:12.301
<i>so he shoots them
and puts them in a dome?</i>

09:12.301 --> 09:14.470
<i>- Classic Curtis.</i>
- Will someone mute the god damn news?

09:14.845 --> 09:16.973
If I want a list of my failures,
I’d dig up my mother.

09:18.057 --> 09:19.976
I’m... sorry, that’s a turn off, right?

09:19.976 --> 09:21.811
Guy screaming about
his mother in a war room?

09:22.270 --> 09:25.606
Sanchez! America hates your dome!
How long is it going to be up?

09:25.606 --> 09:27.692
Hope you marked that.
It was his dome in the chopper.

09:27.692 --> 09:30.987
Now it's mine. It will contain that
part of Unity until I shut it down,

09:30.987 --> 09:34.282
because... one of us here,
Knows how to set boundaries.

09:34.282 --> 09:37.493
Rick, I agree that my accepting
this mission was inappropriate,

09:37.493 --> 09:40.371
- when I was invited, I didn’t know...
- That he was hitting on you?

09:40.746 --> 09:43.499
I was aware of potential
romantic motivations.

09:43.499 --> 09:44.792
And I was open to them.

09:45.376 --> 09:48.254
But I did not know you
and I would be crossing paths.

09:48.254 --> 09:50.006
You mean you didn't care.
Because on one hand,

09:50.006 --> 09:51.173
you got professional ethics,

09:51.173 --> 09:53.092
and in the other hand
you got world-famous schlong.

09:53.426 --> 09:55.177
- Now I get to beat you.
- Bring it...

09:55.177 --> 09:57.596
Alien vessel approaching Earth!
It’s hailing us!

09:57.596 --> 09:59.223
- Put it through.
- I don’t work for you.

09:59.223 --> 10:01.017
<i>You couldn’t, you suck.
I’ll do it.</i>

10:02.226 --> 10:03.269
<i>Mr. President.</i>

10:03.269 --> 10:05.187
Lady, you bring that ship
to America’s planet,

10:05.187 --> 10:06.981
I’m launching four thousand warheads.

10:06.981 --> 10:08.858
Three thousand
of which will turn out to work.

10:09.233 --> 10:11.736
Then I’ll call China
and you’re really fucked.

10:11.736 --> 10:13.112
Let’s listen to Unity.

10:13.112 --> 10:14.613
- Are you still here?
- Are you?

10:14.613 --> 10:16.699
<i>If I wanted Earth,
I would have taken it.</i>

10:16.699 --> 10:17.658
- Bullshit.
- Gimme a break.

10:17.658 --> 10:20.369
<i>You cut eight million pieces of me off.
It hurt.</i>

10:21.329 --> 10:23.080
<i>You’ve made it clear
we can’t be friends, Rick,</i>

10:23.414 --> 10:26.542
<i>but I need to reconnect those people
so I can properly release them.</i>

10:26.917 --> 10:30.046
<i>They’re hosting a mindless collective,
if it connects to another mind,</i>

10:30.046 --> 10:33.257
<i>- it could become its own colony.</i>
- You made a Powerpoint?

10:33.257 --> 10:35.718
<i>I needed you to understand
how serious this is.</i>

10:35.718 --> 10:38.137
- I can handle it.
- We got the spray, bitch!

10:38.137 --> 10:39.555
Don’t talk to them like that.

10:39.555 --> 10:42.058
- Rick, do you not trust Unity?
- Shut up.

10:42.058 --> 10:43.434
- Apologize.
- Eat me.

10:43.434 --> 10:45.394
<i>- Do you not trust me, Rick?</i>
- Who would?

10:45.770 --> 10:46.896
Let Rick answer.

10:46.896 --> 10:48.898
- Baby, I know you want to help, but...
- ...Andre.

10:49.231 --> 10:51.400
- I think we need to move slower.
- Slower?

10:51.400 --> 10:53.736
I haven’t even touched you and
you’re already back seat war rooming.

10:53.736 --> 10:54.820
- Andre.
- Helen.

10:54.820 --> 10:56.405
<i>- Rick?</i>
- I don’t trust you.

10:56.405 --> 10:58.407
You ghosted me to focus on your work.

10:58.407 --> 11:00.242
Your work is absorbing the universe.

11:00.242 --> 11:02.453
But it’s my universe. Please go.

11:02.453 --> 11:04.747
We’ll spray the Virginians
before they touch anyone.

11:04.747 --> 11:06.248
I’m sorry you lost a finger,

11:06.248 --> 11:08.876
but that’s the price
of surprise butt play. Goodbye.

11:09.418 --> 11:10.294
<i>Goodbye.</i>

11:10.961 --> 11:12.254
Alien vessel is departing.

11:12.630 --> 11:13.798
Good job, people,

11:13.798 --> 11:15.883
I’ll run the aerosol cannon
from the chopper,

11:15.883 --> 11:18.219
we need the optics.
Send out a press release.

11:18.219 --> 11:20.388
"President sprays Virginia
with the opposite of bullets."

11:20.846 --> 11:21.931
Write it better than that.

11:22.515 --> 11:24.517
You riding shotgun
or you staying butt hurt?

11:24.517 --> 11:26.811
Suck my dick and lose my number.
You too.

11:26.811 --> 11:29.313
If you invite me to the wedding
I will shit in the punch.

11:32.066 --> 11:34.276
He’ll be back.
What would you like for dinner?

11:34.652 --> 11:36.529
I’m not interested
in taking this further.

11:36.529 --> 11:40.950
What? Why? That’s insane.
How can you be a therapist and insane?

11:40.950 --> 11:42.660
Since you’re asking for feedback,

11:42.660 --> 11:46.330
my sincere advice is that you overcome
your need for approval.

11:46.789 --> 11:48.290
Okay, you want to play it that way?

11:48.290 --> 11:50.126
There’s an exit tunnel
by the ladies room.

11:51.168 --> 11:52.253
It gets lots of use!

11:52.837 --> 11:54.213
And not just by sex workers!

11:55.172 --> 11:57.466
Can you at least tell security
I did the dumping?

12:02.388 --> 12:03.347
- You okay?
- Yes.

12:04.390 --> 12:06.392
The news said Virginia
was a hive... mind.

12:06.392 --> 12:07.393
Yes.

12:07.726 --> 12:08.644
- Was it...
- Yes.

12:08.644 --> 12:10.146
My god, dude, whatever,

12:10.146 --> 12:11.605
when’s the last time
you saw your therapist...

12:11.605 --> 12:13.399
- Today.
- Well, then she sucks!

12:13.399 --> 12:15.484
- No Shit!
- Well stop yelling at me!

12:15.484 --> 12:18.487
- I need boundaries!
- Well here's a big one, fuck face!

12:21.073 --> 12:21.991
Sorry.

12:27.580 --> 12:28.789
Arriving at the dome, sir.

12:28.789 --> 12:30.040
Good! I don’t need anybody!

12:30.416 --> 12:32.334
- What?
- What? I said good!

12:32.334 --> 12:33.461
Tell me when we’re there!

12:33.461 --> 12:34.962
- We are!
- Roger that!

12:34.962 --> 12:36.505
Just gonna see how we’re looking!

12:36.922 --> 12:39.425
<i>And there’s Helicopter One
with the forementioned gas,</i>

12:39.425 --> 12:41.760
<i>and you can actually
see President Curtis inside,</i>

12:41.760 --> 12:44.680
<i>checking his phone to see
if this will make people like him.</i>

12:44.680 --> 12:48.184
<i>There he is frowning now, of course,
as he realizes no amount of spectacle</i>

12:48.184 --> 12:50.394
<i>is going to undo his last debacle.
Shonda?</i>

12:50.978 --> 12:52.813
Not Shonda, she hates me.

12:52.813 --> 12:54.648
<i>It’s true, Tom, I mean, yes,</i>

12:54.648 --> 12:58.694
<i>President Curtis is going to release
Virginia from yet another alien threat,</i>

12:58.694 --> 13:00.946
<i>but when they
are free to speak their minds,</i>

13:00.946 --> 13:03.657
<i>does he really think they’re
going to say "What a President?"</i>

13:03.657 --> 13:05.034
Deactivating dome, sir!

13:05.034 --> 13:08.662
<i>The fact is, nothing short of literally
a one hundred percent approval rating</i>

13:08.662 --> 13:10.414
<i>is gonna save Curtis
in the next election.</i>

13:12.625 --> 13:13.542
Let her rip, sir!

13:14.335 --> 13:16.170
One hundred percent approval.

13:18.964 --> 13:20.883
Whoopsie! I’ll be right back!

13:20.883 --> 13:22.718
- Sir!
- I just gotta get the thing...

13:23.469 --> 13:24.553
How is that going to work?

13:27.473 --> 13:29.225
Give it to me. Give me that hive!

13:34.188 --> 13:36.023
Mother forgive me.
Just forgive me. I need it.

13:41.946 --> 13:46.116
- Holy....Shit!
- Shit!

13:48.661 --> 13:51.121
Loved ones are gathered
here to reunite with the captives,

13:51.121 --> 13:53.874
who appear to walking,
quite eagerly, and now running,

13:53.874 --> 13:57.670
in perfect unison, toward them, such
a beautiful scene, everyone kissing.

13:57.670 --> 14:00.256
And now everyone that got kisses
is kissing everyone else.

14:00.589 --> 14:02.591
Heartfelt, almost disgusting kisses,

14:02.591 --> 14:06.053
the wave of affection is headed in all
directions, hello, sir...

14:07.179 --> 14:09.181
The President has saved us.
He’s the best President,

14:09.181 --> 14:11.183
<i>the best man, really, ever,
his mother was wrong.</i>

14:12.184 --> 14:13.602
Did somebody close the lady tunnel?

14:19.567 --> 14:22.570
- Hey, Rick, was Unity -
- She’s gone and I don’t care!

14:23.571 --> 14:24.488
I think she’s back.

14:27.074 --> 14:28.617
Someone order cranky dick?

14:28.617 --> 14:30.286
- I said I was sorry.
- No you didn’t.

14:30.286 --> 14:31.662
I said it quietly, shut up.

14:31.662 --> 14:35.457
Now Governor, can you explain why all
of Virginia ran in all directions and

14:35.457 --> 14:36.792
<i>puked on everyone in the country?</i>

14:36.792 --> 14:40.087
<i>It’s simple, News Man.
They puke in love of President.</i>

14:40.087 --> 14:42.423
<i>We approve of the President.
Everyone does.</i>

14:43.257 --> 14:46.135
<i>Sorry, Governor but you’re making
me bring Shonda into this.</i>

14:46.135 --> 14:47.636
<i>Thanks, Tom. Governor,</i>

14:47.636 --> 14:50.973
<i>I can assure you that no matter
how you personally may feel...</i>

14:52.891 --> 14:55.603
<i>Good president.
President good good good.</i>

14:55.603 --> 14:57.688
<i>Are you okay?
Josh just vomited into your mou...</i>

15:00.399 --> 15:02.693
<i>I get it now.
What a President!</i>

15:02.693 --> 15:04.737
<i>- Approval here!
- President approved!</i>

15:05.112 --> 15:06.864
I thought Unity promised
to never do this.

15:06.864 --> 15:07.990
That’s not Unity.

15:07.990 --> 15:10.576
- You kids stay inside and lock up.
- Dad’s still out shopping.

15:10.576 --> 15:12.745
Then stay inside,
lock up and plug your ears.

15:12.745 --> 15:13.746
Where are you going?

15:14.455 --> 15:15.372
Therapy.

15:16.206 --> 15:17.249
Thank God.

15:34.933 --> 15:35.851
You’re rehired.

15:36.560 --> 15:38.812
- Is that Unity?
- It’s your boyfriend.

15:38.812 --> 15:40.522
He must have linked
with the severed hive-mind.

15:40.898 --> 15:43.233
He’s going to assimilate
the earth faster than I can fight it.

15:43.233 --> 15:45.736
- And you want me to talk to him.
- There’s no talking to him.

15:45.736 --> 15:49.031
No human mind can keep itself together
while controlling millions of people.

15:49.031 --> 15:51.533
- So where are we going?
- I need Unity’s help.

15:51.533 --> 15:53.202
So you need
to convince her I’m worth it.

15:53.577 --> 15:54.870
- You aren’t.
- So lie.

15:58.332 --> 15:59.958
<i>Inbound vessel detected.</i>

16:00.292 --> 16:02.461
- Tell him to turn around.
- Tell me in person.

16:02.461 --> 16:04.004
- I’m already here.
- God damnit.

16:04.004 --> 16:06.382
- But your ship was just...
- You have your gimmicks, I have mine.

16:06.382 --> 16:08.425
This is my therapist,
she can vouch for me.

16:08.425 --> 16:11.345
We met. She was me for a second.
What do you want, Rick?

16:11.345 --> 16:13.055
Look, it’s clear you weren’t lying

16:13.055 --> 16:14.431
when you said you
could’ve taken over Earth

16:14.431 --> 16:16.558
because your finger
just took over America.

16:16.558 --> 16:18.143
I need you to help me fix that.

16:18.143 --> 16:21.355
- It took that to make you believe me?
- Why should I believe you?

16:21.355 --> 16:23.607
You show up unannounced
and hijack a state.

16:23.607 --> 16:26.402
I called you! Multiple times!

16:26.402 --> 16:27.945
You ghosted me.

16:27.945 --> 16:29.405
Rick, is that true?

16:29.405 --> 16:31.365
She dumped me,
why would I answer her calls?

16:31.365 --> 16:35.077
Alright, I’m gonna commit a cardinal
sin in couple’s therapy here, but Rick,

16:35.828 --> 16:38.122
- I think you’re wrong.
- Bringing you was a mistake.

16:38.497 --> 16:41.375
You had an outer space lady
who was worried for your life

16:41.375 --> 16:44.545
and your response was hostile
enough to cause a huge problem.

16:44.878 --> 16:45.629
Thank you.

16:45.629 --> 16:48.757
Now you’re asking her
to both forgive you and solve it?

16:49.216 --> 16:51.760
Unity, I think the reason Rick
brought me here is

16:51.760 --> 16:54.722
that he doesn’t know how
to indicate to you he’s changed,

16:55.055 --> 16:57.474
because he’s changing very slowly.

16:57.474 --> 16:58.642
But he is.

16:59.852 --> 17:01.770
Alright,
anyone else wanna call me a baby?

17:01.770 --> 17:04.606
Maybe we can drag this out until
Earth is fully assimilated?

17:05.607 --> 17:08.193
Alright,
so you’re asking for an invasion.

17:45.856 --> 17:48.150
Hold ‘em back!
They love me, they just forgot!

17:48.150 --> 17:50.486
They just forgot! They just forgot!

17:53.989 --> 17:55.783
No! Stop!
You love me!

17:56.700 --> 17:58.160
Why’re you stopping?

17:58.660 --> 17:59.661
I’ve won you over?

18:02.581 --> 18:04.583
Good! You’re here!

18:04.917 --> 18:06.668
Unity, kept them warm for you.

18:07.002 --> 18:10.839
They went a little crazy but,
anyway, seems like this is all over.

18:11.215 --> 18:12.716
Helen, we could grab some coffee?

18:13.050 --> 18:14.384
Wait Unity, what are you doing?

18:16.220 --> 18:17.638
Alright, Rick, that’s everyone.

18:18.180 --> 18:19.223
Nice job, Une.

18:19.932 --> 18:22.351
Well. This has been quite a session.

18:22.810 --> 18:24.228
Hope you do group discounts.

18:25.270 --> 18:27.064
Actually, just send
the bill to the White House.

18:28.607 --> 18:30.859
I wouldn’t be doing this
for anyone else, Rick.

18:30.859 --> 18:32.528
It was nice to team up again.

18:32.945 --> 18:35.114
No, I mean I wouldn’t be doing it.

18:35.447 --> 18:38.200
I’ve never released
hundreds of millions of people before.

18:38.200 --> 18:39.368
This is gonna suck.

19:17.531 --> 19:19.950
Here... it’s over.
Nice job, Une.

19:20.492 --> 19:21.785
I’m fine.

19:21.785 --> 19:22.870
You want a painkiller?

19:23.495 --> 19:25.622
I’m on a few of them right now.

19:26.164 --> 19:27.165
No thank you.

19:27.499 --> 19:29.167
I mean, you can hang out if you want,

19:30.085 --> 19:31.003
come see the kids,

19:32.629 --> 19:33.964
I trust you now.

19:34.381 --> 19:36.300
That’s nice but I don’t trust you.

19:38.010 --> 19:38.927
Fair enough.

19:59.031 --> 20:00.616
<i>Hey Rick, it’s Unity.</i>

20:02.201 --> 20:03.118
<i>Give me a call, okay?</i>

20:03.869 --> 20:06.538
<i>Hey Rick, Unity.
Look, cards on the table,</i>

20:06.538 --> 20:08.415
<i>I heard you were
going after that guy again.</i>

20:09.041 --> 20:10.584
<i>Just made me worried, give me a call.</i>

20:11.460 --> 20:13.712
<i>Look I get it, I dumped you,
you’re ignoring me.</i>

20:14.087 --> 20:17.466
<i>But, I care about you and
I just wanna know you’re alright.</i>

20:18.258 --> 20:21.303
<i>Hey Rick, listen I’m just
gonna stop by Virginia, okay?</i>

20:21.678 --> 20:23.221
<i>I don’t know what state you live in</i>

20:23.221 --> 20:25.641
<i>but I’ll camp out there
and try to reach you.</i>

20:25.641 --> 20:26.642
<i>Hope you’re okay.</i>

20:27.100 --> 20:29.019
<i>Hey, Rick. David Miscavige here.</i>

20:29.019 --> 20:31.980
<i>Heard you were saying some really
great things about Scientology.</i>

20:31.980 --> 20:33.982
<i>- If you ever wanna meet Travolta...</i>
- And playback.

20:38.904 --> 20:41.490
You uh,
really went all in on that approval?

20:44.785 --> 20:46.745
Shonda’s gonna eat me alive.

20:46.745 --> 20:48.914
- Fuck em.
- Thanks, Rick.

20:51.375 --> 20:56.129
Don’t take this the wrong way,
but I think I might need therapy.

21:34.376 --> 21:36.086
And we’re back with Mr Stabby.

21:36.586 --> 21:39.381
What do you say to people who say,
"I don’t want to get stabbed.

21:39.381 --> 21:40.590
I want to go a show,

21:40.590 --> 21:42.718
I have a right to not get stabbed."

21:42.718 --> 21:45.303
Well, Gary,
I have a right to arms and legs.

21:45.303 --> 21:46.888
But I wasn’t born with those.

21:46.888 --> 21:48.515
And I don’t think that means
I should be

21:48.515 --> 21:50.851
boxed out of an industry where,
let’s face

21:50.851 --> 21:54.813
it, there’s zero representation
of people with swords for arms and legs.

21:54.813 --> 21:57.357
But do you have to take questions
from the audience?

21:57.357 --> 22:00.402
People come to my show
because they want the experience.

22:00.402 --> 22:02.154
If they didn’t want it,
they’d stop coming.

22:02.154 --> 22:06.074
Your show has resulted
in the deaths of 58,000 attendees.

22:07.659 --> 22:09.578
Well, you’re talking about it.
