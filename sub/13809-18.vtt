THE SKATEBOARD
CONTEST?

21:02.761 --> 21:05.180
{\an1}I ASKED YOU
FOR HELP.

21:05.263 --> 21:06.890
{\an1}I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU'RE SO...

21:06.974 --> 21:07.599
IRRESPONSIBLE.

21:07.683 --> 21:08.934
IRRESPONSIBLE!

21:09.017 --> 21:09.851
INCONSIDERATE.

21:09.935 --> 21:11.478
INCONSIDERATE!

21:11.561 --> 21:12.521
TO YOUR SISTER!

21:12.604 --> 21:13.689

{\an5}THERE'S NO WAY
I'M TOUCHING
YOUR SKATES NOW!

21:24.408 --> 21:25.409
OH, I GET IT.

21:25.492 --> 21:27.202
{\an4}YOU GUYS MADE
A DEAL BEHIND
MY BACK!

21:27.285 --> 21:30.372
YOU BOTH <i> KNOW</i> BETTER
THAN TO LIE TO ME!

21:30.455 --> 21:32.374
BUT DAD, I MADE THE FINALS.

21:32.457 --> 21:35.168
I DON'T CARE IF YOU MADE
THE WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS!

21:35.252 --> 21:36.253
I MADE THE FINALS!

21:36.336 --> 21:39.715
BUT... I KNOW I SHOULD
BE HELPING YOU, SO...

21:39.798 --> 21:41.383
I'M LEAVING IT UP TO YOU, DAD.

21:41.466 --> 21:42.843
LET ME SKATE IN THE FINALS?

21:42.926 --> 21:45.387
OR... MAKE ME HELP OUT HERE.

21:45.470 --> 21:48.390
I THINK YOU SHOULD
HELP OUT HERE...

21:48.473 --> 21:49.891
(<i> all three</i> )
AW...

21:49.975 --> 21:52.185
BUT I'M GOING
TO LET YOU SKATE.

21:52.269 --> 21:53.812
REALLY?

21:53.895 --> 21:54.980
YEAH, DAD,
YOU'RE THE BEST!

21:55.063 --> 21:59.359
{\an4}BUT YOU'RE NOT
GETTING OFF
THAT EASY!

21:59.443 --> 22:00.861
WHATEVER HAPPENED TO SAM?

22:00.944 --> 22:04.031
THE LAST I SAW HIM HE WAS GOING
TO GET SOMETHING OUT OF...

22:04.114 --> 22:05.991
THE FREEZER!

22:09.619 --> 22:10.078
S... SU... SU...

22:10.162 --> 22:12.497
WHAT'S HE TRYING
TO SAY?

22:12.581 --> 22:14.624
{\an5}SUN? YOU WANT
TO GET OUT
IN THE SUN?

22:14.708 --> 22:15.876
SU... S...

22:15.959 --> 22:17.085

22:17.169 --> 22:18.295
{\an1}TRACTOR?

22:18.378 --> 22:22.299
ICE CREAM... S...
SU... SUNDAE, ANYONE?

22:25.427 --> 22:26.887
MMM, HMM.

22:26.970 --> 22:28.764
(<i> sneezes</i> )

22:28.847 --> 22:34.686
THE SUNDAE MAKES ME FEEL
A WHOLE LOT BETTER, BROTHER.

22:34.770 --> 22:36.271
GLAD TO HEAR IT, BRO

22:36.354 --> 22:39.775
BUT I WANTED THE NEWS,
NOT THE WEATHER.

22:39.858 --> 22:42.194
YOU THINK OTTO AND REGGIE
WANT SUNDAES, TOO?

22:42.277 --> 22:43.487
{\an1}NOT A CHANCE,
SQUID MAN.

22:43.570 --> 22:47.741
I THINK THEY'RE GOING
TO BE BUSY FOR A WHILE, SAMMY.

22:53.371 --> 22:54.581
