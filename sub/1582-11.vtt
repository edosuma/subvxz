D'oh!

00:12.244 --> 00:14.011
Welcome to Super Bowl XLVIII

00:14.046 --> 00:19.483
between the Seattle Seahawks
and the Denver Broncos.

00:19.518 --> 00:22.286
The field is a frozen tundra,

00:22.321 --> 00:23.854
imported at great expense
from Alaska.

00:23.889 --> 00:25.423
Hmm?

00:25.457 --> 00:26.457
Hmm?!

00:26.491 --> 00:27.491
Huh...?

01:02.627 --> 01:04.995
And the game
comes down to this one play--

01:05.030 --> 01:06.597
a final field goal.

01:06.631 --> 01:08.499
The kick is up,
it hits the crossbar and--

01:09.534 --> 01:10.768
D'oh!

the company Christmas gifts.

01:40.165 --> 01:41.866
Who told you that?

01:41.900 --> 01:42.867
I got an in.

01:42.901 --> 01:43.834
The VP of Personnel

01:43.869 --> 01:45.870
is doing my girlfriend.

01:45.904 --> 01:48.572
Ooh, look at you,
Mr. Connected.

01:48.607 --> 01:50.941
I hope it's better than
last year's lousy gift.

01:50.976 --> 01:52.510
Yeah, what a rip.

01:52.544 --> 01:53.978
Ugh. Remember this gift?

01:54.012 --> 01:56.047
The executive stress ball.

01:56.081 --> 01:58.315
One more squeeze
and you're fired.

01:58.350 --> 02:00.418
Now I feel
more stressed than ever.

02:00.452 --> 02:01.952
Gah!

02:01.987 --> 02:03.621
Excellent.

02:03.655 --> 02:05.756
Excellent. Excellent.

02:05.791 --> 02:08.225
Uh, you don't look
so excellent to me.

02:10.961 --> 02:12.730
Ho, ho, humbug.

02:12.764 --> 02:15.800
Santa Claus approaches
to judge and punish.

02:19.071 --> 02:22.073
Wow! A good gift
for once.

02:22.107 --> 02:23.674
Oogle Goggles.

02:23.708 --> 02:25.843
Augmented reality glasses.

02:25.877 --> 02:28.412
You wear them like eyeglasses,
but inside the lens,

02:28.447 --> 02:31.015
you see information about the
people and places around you.

02:31.049 --> 02:34.785
Ooh, finally I'm not a slave
to my stupid human eyeballs.

02:36.788 --> 02:38.322
Ooh!

02:38.356 --> 02:40.024
Whoa.

02:44.996 --> 02:46.363
Glasses, call Lenny.

02:46.398 --> 02:48.032
Ooh, I'm getting a call.

02:48.066 --> 02:49.033
Answer call.

02:49.067 --> 02:50.067
Hello?

02:50.102 --> 02:52.536
Lenny, it's me, Homer.

02:54.739 --> 02:57.341
Hm. I always thought
it was "Simp-sen."

02:57.375 --> 03:00.010
Really? Don't you ever
look up at the sky?

03:04.950 --> 03:06.550
Always wondered
what that was.

03:07.586 --> 03:08.853
Sir, I'm concerned about

03:08.887 --> 03:10.221
your sudden generosity.

03:10.255 --> 03:11.856
The doctor said
to bring you in right away

03:11.890 --> 03:13.491
if you display
kindness or warmth.

03:13.525 --> 03:14.725
Oh, don't worry.

03:14.759 --> 03:16.961
This Santa still has claws.

03:19.197 --> 03:20.998
As of now, each of
those nuclear nitwits

03:21.032 --> 03:22.333
is wearing a
video camera.

03:22.367 --> 03:24.869
With a direct feed to me.

03:24.903 --> 03:26.437
You're
spying on them?

03:26.471 --> 03:28.706
Smithers, how much
did this company lose

03:28.740 --> 03:30.774
to office supply
theft last year?

03:30.809 --> 03:33.010
$7,043.

03:33.044 --> 03:34.879
Yes, well, no more of that.

03:34.913 --> 03:37.615
Thanks to this $26 million
surveillance system.

03:37.649 --> 03:38.682
Beware, rabbits.

03:38.717 --> 03:41.519
I spy with my transplanted eyes.

03:41.553 --> 03:44.255
Oh, and I forgot
to show you the best feature.

03:44.289 --> 03:47.925
Each of these buttons
represents an employee.

03:47.959 --> 03:51.262
When I press it,
he or she dies.

03:54.933 --> 03:57.067
What's wrong
with this thing?

04:19.858 --> 04:21.325
Now, remember kids,

04:21.358 --> 04:23.961
the school says you must
have a valentine card

04:23.995 --> 04:26.096
for everyone in your class.

04:26.131 --> 04:29.500
How does this mean anything
when everyone's forced to do it?

04:29.534 --> 04:31.302
What did I say
about pointing out

04:31.336 --> 04:33.771
the meaninglessness
of things?

04:33.805 --> 04:35.439
Not to.

04:35.473 --> 04:37.074
Well, no way I'm giving
a valentine to Nelson.

04:37.108 --> 04:39.276
He's a bully,
and I do not love him.

04:39.311 --> 04:41.345
Jesus says
to love your enemies.

04:41.379 --> 04:43.647
That's because
Jesus knows one day,

04:43.682 --> 04:46.584
he gets to look
his enemies in the eye and say

04:46.618 --> 04:49.954
"It was me who
sent you to Hell."

04:49.988 --> 04:51.689
Bart, your school
requires you

04:51.723 --> 04:53.857
to give everyone
a valentine card

04:53.892 --> 04:56.794
in an envelope
with a fun sticker.

04:56.828 --> 04:59.129
Your teacher
put out an e-mail alert.

04:59.164 --> 05:01.799
With a video attachment.

05:01.833 --> 05:05.202
Welcome to <i>Firstline.</i> Tonight,

05:05.237 --> 05:08.205
"Valentine's Day:
Always A Massacre."

05:08.240 --> 05:10.307
<i>At this school,</i>
<i>children may give valentines</i>

05:10.342 --> 05:11.475
<i>to whomever they choose.</i>

05:11.509 --> 05:13.344
<i>Danny is unpopular,</i>

05:13.378 --> 05:17.381
<i>due to rumors he sleeps in the</i>
<i>raw with his ma and his pa.</i>

05:17.415 --> 05:20.884
<i>Human young are born with the</i>
<i>ability to count valentines,</i>

05:20.919 --> 05:23.787
<i>and Danny realizes</i>
<i>he's been snubbed.</i>

05:23.822 --> 05:27.191
Past generations of children
were used to rejection.

05:27.225 --> 05:30.494
But today's kids, raised
in a climate of video games

05:30.528 --> 05:33.397
and instant messaging,
are fragile weirdos.

05:33.431 --> 05:35.666
<i>On February 15, 2:00am,</i>

05:35.700 --> 05:38.636
<i>after checking</i>
<i>the mailbox one last time,</i>

05:38.670 --> 05:41.205
<i>Danny nearly died</i>
<i>from an overdose</i>

05:41.239 --> 05:42.706
<i>of little candy hearts.</i>

05:45.944 --> 05:49.246
<i>Many of history's monsters</i>
<i>never received a valentine.</i>

05:49.281 --> 05:51.749
<i>Attila the Hun,Mao Tse-tung,</i>

05:51.783 --> 05:53.550
<i>and me, Will Lyman.</i>

05:53.585 --> 05:55.252
<i>This is</i> Firstline.

05:55.287 --> 05:57.688
Fine, Nelson
gets a valentine.

05:57.722 --> 05:59.523
An old one from the box.

06:02.260 --> 06:04.094
Perfect. Bad movie, bad pun,

06:04.129 --> 06:06.196
even bad paper stock.

06:10.602 --> 06:12.336
What's so funny?

06:12.370 --> 06:14.838
I'm watching videos of idiots
wearing these glasses

06:14.873 --> 06:18.108
and not paying attention
to the world around them.

06:18.143 --> 06:19.410
Look at these jerks.

06:24.983 --> 06:26.550
Ow!

06:35.827 --> 06:37.561
I don't understand what's
so great about these

06:37.595 --> 06:40.698
state of the art, solar-powered,
computo-glasses.

06:40.732 --> 06:42.032
I'll let you try them on,

06:42.067 --> 06:43.567
right after I decide
if these videos

06:43.601 --> 06:45.102
are Funny Or Die.

06:45.136 --> 06:48.472
Funny, funny, die, die,

06:48.506 --> 06:50.374
funny, funny but
the guy died.

06:50.408 --> 06:51.942
Oh.

06:51.976 --> 06:55.212
Now, a simple Sunday drive
will reveal the hidden wonders

06:55.246 --> 06:57.114
of our hometown.

07:00.318 --> 07:01.318
Hmm...

07:08.460 --> 07:09.360
Whoo-hoo!

07:11.129 --> 07:12.830
D'oh!

07:12.864 --> 07:15.299
Springfield City Hall was built
for the Spencer Tracy movie

07:15.333 --> 07:18.235
<i>Meet Me At City Hall.</i>

07:18.269 --> 07:21.638
It was just a flat wall with
nothing behind it for 30 years.

07:21.673 --> 07:24.408
Dad, Bart's on my side
of the seat.

07:24.442 --> 07:26.810
Dad, Lisa's my
little sister.

07:28.713 --> 07:30.881
The rearview mirror
was invented in 1911,

07:30.915 --> 07:32.249
for just this reason.

07:32.283 --> 07:33.617
Interesting.

07:33.651 --> 07:35.352
When was the term
"shut up" invented?

07:35.387 --> 07:38.288
As early as 1859,
shut up was used to shut up...

07:38.323 --> 07:41.024
Homie, I think the kids
are just hungry.

07:41.059 --> 07:44.461
Glasses, direct me to the nicest
restaurant I can afford.

07:44.496 --> 07:46.196
Accessing soup kitchens.

07:46.231 --> 07:49.133
What, you... Oh, that's it,
I'm taking you off.

07:49.167 --> 07:51.235
Aah! Reality.

07:51.269 --> 07:52.169
<i>Oh! Sorry, sir!</i>

07:53.338 --> 07:56.507
Okay, let's see
what we got here.

08:01.546 --> 08:04.948
Ugh, oh! Ooh.

08:04.983 --> 08:06.517
Eh.

08:10.321 --> 08:12.623
Oh.

08:12.657 --> 08:14.191
Mm-hmm.

08:14.225 --> 08:15.726
Squeeze here.

08:15.760 --> 08:17.528
Rotate there.

08:17.562 --> 08:18.729
Pause for sweet talk.

08:18.763 --> 08:21.298
Oh, glasses,
you're so wonderful.

08:21.332 --> 08:24.968
Huh? A-Are you using your
glasses for snuggling?

08:25.003 --> 08:27.671
But the avatar
looks just like you.

08:27.705 --> 08:29.573
I'm afraid wives
don't make passes

08:29.607 --> 08:32.109
at husbands in
those glasses.

08:33.578 --> 08:35.746
Glasses, find me
a great gift for my wife.

08:35.780 --> 08:37.414
Under five dollars.

08:37.448 --> 08:38.816
I heard that!

08:38.850 --> 08:41.184
Glasses, take me
two minutes back in time.

08:48.761 --> 08:50.362
Oh...

08:50.396 --> 08:51.811
Marge.
Mm.

08:51.812 --> 08:53.680
About the glasses.
Mm!

08:53.714 --> 08:56.282
I'm really sorry, and...
Mm, mm, mm.

08:56.317 --> 08:58.318
Here's your breakfast.

08:58.352 --> 09:00.887
Only five pancakes?

09:00.921 --> 09:02.188
You're trying to kill me.

09:02.223 --> 09:04.190
Well, I'm not happy with you.

09:04.225 --> 09:06.126
Look, honey,
I know these glasses

09:06.160 --> 09:08.128
are a radical
new technology

09:08.162 --> 09:10.163
and should be worn
in moderation.

09:10.197 --> 09:11.464
Isn't that right,
glasses?

09:11.499 --> 09:13.499
Yes, just like I told you.

09:13.501 --> 09:16.069
Anyway, I'm giving them up.

09:16.103 --> 09:19.039
To whoever dares take them.

09:26.547 --> 09:27.747
Yoink.

09:27.782 --> 09:29.349
Aw, come on, Mom.

09:29.383 --> 09:31.818
For once,
I'm grabbing the goody.

09:31.852 --> 09:33.753
So the rumors are true.

09:33.788 --> 09:36.089
Moms <i>can</i> want things.

09:38.325 --> 09:39.859
Hmm.

09:45.132 --> 09:46.166
Hmm...

09:46.200 --> 09:47.834
Nicely done, Lewis.

09:47.868 --> 09:52.238
A Transformer
that transforms into a heart?

09:52.273 --> 09:53.406
I love it!

09:57.878 --> 10:00.080
Mm. This Hershey's Kiss
is melted.

10:00.114 --> 10:02.248
Not good.

10:02.283 --> 10:04.684
My mom left it
on the dashboard!

10:04.718 --> 10:06.352
My mom...!

10:06.387 --> 10:08.788
I'll have yours now, Simpson.

10:10.991 --> 10:12.325
In Ga'hoole,

10:12.359 --> 10:14.260
we would break
his frickin' knees.

10:15.663 --> 10:16.930
No.

10:16.964 --> 10:18.765
No Valentine
for you, Nelson.

10:20.901 --> 10:22.368
Excuse me?

10:22.403 --> 10:24.104
I'll give a Valentine
to a loser,

10:24.138 --> 10:25.805
I'll give a Valentine to a dork,

10:25.840 --> 10:27.774
I'll even give a Valentine
to a girl,

10:27.808 --> 10:31.111
but I won't give a Valentine
to a bully!

10:31.145 --> 10:33.580
Here's what's gonna happen.

10:33.614 --> 10:37.717
You have one week to make me the
best Valentine any kid ever got.

10:37.751 --> 10:39.319
And what if I don't?

10:39.353 --> 10:42.055
Simpson, there's gonna be
a heart in my hand,

10:42.089 --> 10:44.524
either paper or yours.

10:46.894 --> 10:48.862
Hey, everybody.
That's strange.

10:48.896 --> 10:52.398
I-I'm hearing a voice,
but I'm not seeing a user icon.

10:52.433 --> 10:54.734
Carl, it's me.
I'm here.

10:54.768 --> 10:56.202
Really here!

10:56.237 --> 10:58.371
Hey, Homer. A lot
of information about you.

10:58.405 --> 11:01.841
Let me just page through it.
Oh! Stop! Hey! What?

11:01.876 --> 11:04.911
Oh, no one can live
in a non-augmented reality.

11:04.945 --> 11:07.147
I need another pair of glasses.

11:08.382 --> 11:10.550
Charlie, your move
in Muppet Chess.

11:10.584 --> 11:12.552
Gonzo to Fozzie Seven.

11:12.586 --> 11:15.788
Aw! That's Kermit-mate.
Wocka wocka!

11:16.457 --> 11:17.757
Oh, why is it

11:17.791 --> 11:19.592
the recipe card
you need is always

11:19.627 --> 11:21.995
the one Homer writes
his cocktail ideas on?

11:23.564 --> 11:26.099
Maybe these
bleep-bloop glasses can help.

11:26.133 --> 11:29.769
Okay, Marge Simpson
entering the Matrix,

11:29.803 --> 11:32.372
for a brownie recipe.

11:32.406 --> 11:34.941
Here are my top-rated recipes.

11:34.975 --> 11:38.811
Ooh. So many choices, Maggie.

11:44.952 --> 11:47.787
Um, Mr. Burns, sir?

11:47.821 --> 11:49.789
Can I get another pair
of glasses?

11:49.823 --> 11:52.225
Maybe two pair?
One for the beach house?

11:52.259 --> 11:54.260
Can I also get a beach house?

11:54.295 --> 11:56.196
<i>Two</i> beach houses.

11:56.230 --> 11:57.096
Huh?

11:57.131 --> 11:58.097
Monitors?!

11:58.132 --> 11:59.399
What the...?

11:59.433 --> 12:04.103
Burns gave us those glasses
so he could spy on us!

12:04.138 --> 12:07.106
This is a violation
of our human rights.

12:07.141 --> 12:08.074
Okay,

12:08.108 --> 12:10.443
so let's see
what we can see.

12:10.477 --> 12:12.512
Solitaire, top hats on eBay,

12:12.546 --> 12:14.747
Angry Birds fan fiction,

12:14.782 --> 12:16.950
guy doing really easy
crossword puzzle,

12:16.984 --> 12:18.751
Lenny doing
Carl's clown makeup...

12:18.786 --> 12:20.820
someone's actually working?

12:20.854 --> 12:22.589
Maggie?!

12:22.623 --> 12:24.757
Who's Mommy's little girl?

12:24.792 --> 12:27.260
Genealogy.org says <i>you</i> are!

12:27.294 --> 12:28.795
You are!

12:30.197 --> 12:32.165
Aw...

12:32.199 --> 12:35.001
Wait a minute. Since Marge
is wearing my glasses,

12:35.035 --> 12:37.270
I can see everything she sees!

12:37.304 --> 12:39.272
Uh-uh, I shouldn't watch this.

12:39.306 --> 12:41.040
Such a good baby.

12:41.075 --> 12:43.042
You deserve some ice cream.

12:43.077 --> 12:46.379
Wait a minute-- Marge said
we were out of ice cream.

12:48.716 --> 12:49.916
Ooh!

12:52.219 --> 12:54.087
Oh!

12:54.121 --> 12:56.856
What else
is Marge hiding from me?

12:56.890 --> 12:59.993
Maggie, he's here!

13:00.027 --> 13:02.462
Oh, is she having an affair?

13:02.496 --> 13:05.632
Thanks for asking me to lunch.

13:05.666 --> 13:08.701
Oh, why isn't she
having an affair?!

13:10.271 --> 13:14.240
What about a Valentine
that says: "Bully, for you"?

13:14.275 --> 13:16.643
Hmm, interesting.

13:16.677 --> 13:18.244
"Interesting" means "no."

13:18.279 --> 13:20.179
"Interesting" means "no."

13:21.615 --> 13:23.416
Milhouse, you're a genius!

13:23.450 --> 13:25.551
I am? What did I say?

13:25.586 --> 13:27.720
Oh, nothing.

13:27.755 --> 13:29.722
On TV when a guy
says something lame,

13:29.757 --> 13:32.725
another guy says he's a genius,
and then he has an idea.

13:32.760 --> 13:34.594
I thought it might
work for me.

13:34.628 --> 13:36.963
Well, you called me a genius.

13:36.997 --> 13:38.398
That means a lot.

13:38.432 --> 13:40.833
Oh, I hate this
stupid holiday!

13:40.868 --> 13:43.503
The only thing you
can do is screw it up.

13:43.537 --> 13:45.104
That's it!

13:45.139 --> 13:47.440
Bart, you're a genius!

13:47.474 --> 13:50.743
Well, if you keep throwing the
word around, it means nothing.

13:53.580 --> 13:55.448
Who are you?
Mr. Burns!

13:55.482 --> 13:57.350
Oh. I'm so sorry,
Mr. Burns.

13:57.384 --> 13:59.485
I won't bother
you again.

14:05.059 --> 14:07.894
<i>Marge, that's</i>
<i>a "Compact Only" space.</i>

14:10.431 --> 14:13.599
Well...
who knew <i>you</i> were such a rebel?

14:13.634 --> 14:17.236
Now let's learn more
about my wife's secret life.

14:17.271 --> 14:20.907
Secrets which can only be good.

14:20.941 --> 14:22.809
Hi, Marge.

14:22.843 --> 14:24.811
Dr. Carlock is ready for you.

14:24.845 --> 14:26.479
Thank you.

14:27.681 --> 14:29.649
So, Marge, how have you been?

14:29.683 --> 14:31.818
Okay, I guess.

14:31.852 --> 14:34.087
Marge is in therapy?!

14:34.121 --> 14:35.988
Oh, I hate when I come here

14:36.023 --> 14:38.458
and the first word
out of my mouth is "Homer."

14:38.492 --> 14:40.493
But here we go, again.

14:40.527 --> 14:44.297
Homer was converting
our dollars to "yu-ros."

14:44.331 --> 14:46.899
Not the money,
the sandwich.

14:51.525 --> 14:53.943
And has there been any
improvement in Homer's drinking?

14:54.029 --> 14:56.664
Well, he's down
to two beers in the shower.

14:56.698 --> 14:58.833
They're pale ales! Please!

14:58.867 --> 15:00.501
Well, maybe if
you just concentrate

15:00.535 --> 15:02.303
on one problem, like his temper.

15:02.337 --> 15:05.406
Oh, everything
in the newspaper makes him mad.

15:05.440 --> 15:08.175
Not <i>Marmaduke!</i>
Never <i>Marmaduke!</i>

15:08.210 --> 15:10.845
<i>Marmaduke</i> was
horrible today!

15:10.879 --> 15:14.582
Also, Marge is in therapy,
and she didn't even tell me.

15:14.616 --> 15:17.151
Whoa. She has
crossed a line.

15:17.185 --> 15:19.153
How did you find out?

15:19.187 --> 15:20.921
Spied on her
with a hidden camera.

15:20.956 --> 15:22.657
She thinks I'm selfish.

15:22.691 --> 15:25.259
She thinks I don't spend
enough time with the kids.

15:25.293 --> 15:26.894
Well, that's crazy.
Come on.

15:26.928 --> 15:29.363
You work your butt off in
a radioactive hellhole,

15:29.398 --> 15:32.099
and what do you get?
Not one lousy superpower.

15:32.134 --> 15:34.301
I guess the only choice
is to come clean with her

15:34.336 --> 15:36.337
and tell her what I know,
and <i>how</i> I know.

15:36.371 --> 15:37.371
Whoa, whoa!

15:37.406 --> 15:38.873
Bad idea. No, no.

15:38.907 --> 15:42.009
Chicks do not like finding out
they're being spied on.

15:42.044 --> 15:48.549
I speak from loooooong....

15:48.583 --> 15:49.917
experience.

15:49.951 --> 15:52.086
No, you got to make it seem like

15:52.120 --> 15:53.754
you found out by accident there.

15:53.789 --> 15:55.256
Um... ooh!

15:55.290 --> 15:57.091
Next week <i>you</i> schedule
an appointment

15:57.125 --> 16:00.261
with the therapist after hers,
and then you bump into Midge

16:00.295 --> 16:01.696
in the waiting
room there.

16:01.730 --> 16:03.531
Moe, that's great!

16:03.565 --> 16:05.533
How do you get your ideas?

16:05.567 --> 16:07.835
Pretty much all my friends
are divorced guys.

16:09.271 --> 16:11.706
Hello, Homie!

16:11.740 --> 16:12.873
Dinner's almost ready.

16:12.908 --> 16:15.810
Pork chops with
my secret seasoning.

16:15.844 --> 16:19.914
Yeah, you <i>do</i> like your
secrets, don't you, Marge?

16:19.948 --> 16:21.982
Don't lose your
cool, Homer.

16:22.017 --> 16:25.386
The building block of a
marriage is <i>long</i> silence.

16:25.420 --> 16:27.121
Hey, where'd
she go?

16:27.155 --> 16:29.123
Good, good,
you held your tongue there.

16:29.157 --> 16:30.758
Because-- hey, where'd <i>you</i> go?

16:30.792 --> 16:34.128
Doesn't anybody want me
to give 'em advice?

16:34.162 --> 16:36.997
Okay there, Fido, when you
see that squirrel outside,

16:37.032 --> 16:39.633
at first you play it cool,
you understand?

16:42.871 --> 16:44.772
"I fear you"?

16:44.806 --> 16:47.408
This is what Valentine's Day
means to you?!

16:47.442 --> 16:49.276
This is what it means
to everyone.

16:49.311 --> 16:51.946
How can you be forced
to say "I love you"?

16:51.980 --> 16:54.482
People only give Valentines
because they're scared

16:54.516 --> 16:56.951
of what would happen
if they didn't.

16:56.985 --> 17:00.187
"Nelson, you frighten me so,

17:00.222 --> 17:02.656
"The psycho-est bully I know,

17:02.691 --> 17:06.160
"You're a sociopath
in need of a bath,

17:06.194 --> 17:09.396
I'm sure you'll wind up
on death row."

17:12.134 --> 17:15.301
Mmm! You can really smell
the fear on this.

17:15.337 --> 17:16.871
I rubbed it on Milhouse.

17:16.905 --> 17:19.440
Simpson, you just
touched my heart's butt.

17:19.473 --> 17:21.442
Why are you hugging yourself?

17:21.476 --> 17:23.810
Why are you
hugging yourself?!

17:23.845 --> 17:26.881
If Nelson doesn't do something
bully-ish in two seconds,

17:26.915 --> 17:28.549
I'm gonna wedgie him.

17:28.583 --> 17:30.684
Nelson doesn't
wear underwear.

17:30.719 --> 17:33.487
Wow. Always
one step ahead.

17:35.657 --> 17:38.192
Uh, I'm here to
check in for the 3:00.

17:38.226 --> 17:40.995
Please fill out these
forms, Mr. Fakinami.

17:41.029 --> 17:44.131
No, it's "Fake Name."
I'll just call you Elias.

17:44.166 --> 17:46.500
That's "Alias."

17:46.535 --> 17:47.735
Duh. Hm!

17:56.211 --> 17:58.012
<i>Finally.</i>

17:58.046 --> 18:01.015
<i>Time for the big bump-into.</i>

18:01.049 --> 18:02.850
Same time
next week, Marge?

18:02.884 --> 18:04.418
Oh, absolutely.

18:04.452 --> 18:06.921
These sessions keep me
on an even keel.

18:06.955 --> 18:10.558
Dr. Carlock is like
my Wednesday reset button.

18:10.592 --> 18:12.259
<i>Wednesday?</i>

18:27.209 --> 18:31.912
<i>Okay, she's always</i>
<i>in a good mood</i> after <i>therapy.</i>

18:50.665 --> 18:52.066
Oh, my God.

18:52.100 --> 18:53.901
Marge <i>needs</i> this.

18:53.935 --> 18:58.038
It lights her way through
the dark path of marriage to me.

18:58.073 --> 18:59.707
Come on in, Mr. Fakinami.

18:59.741 --> 19:01.442
No need.
Everything's fine.

19:01.476 --> 19:04.545
I'm sorry, but there are no
cancellations within 24 hours.

19:04.579 --> 19:07.314
Well, as long as
I'm paying for the time...

19:07.349 --> 19:09.383
Ow! Where'd you learn
to cut hair?

19:10.585 --> 19:12.186
You know, you have
some anger issues.

19:12.220 --> 19:13.921
More snip, less lip.

19:15.257 --> 19:17.091
Oh, I forgot to
tell you, Homie,

19:17.125 --> 19:20.661
I bumped into Helen Lovejoy
today, and guess what?

19:20.695 --> 19:22.129
I don't need
to know, Marge.

19:22.163 --> 19:24.431
You deserve
to have your secrets.

19:24.466 --> 19:26.433
It's not a secret.
It's a funny story.

19:26.468 --> 19:28.836
Okay, Marge,
but first, well...

19:28.870 --> 19:31.105
I have something
I need to tell you.

19:31.139 --> 19:33.340
Something I did
you might be mad about,

19:33.375 --> 19:34.842
and rightly so.

19:34.876 --> 19:37.411
Oh, I bet my story's
more interesting.

19:37.445 --> 19:38.946
Whoo-hoo! I tried!

19:38.980 --> 19:40.080
Okay.
Okay,

19:40.115 --> 19:42.082
so, Helen Lovejoy
told me that

19:42.117 --> 19:45.152
she made her famous snickerdoodle
Bundt cake for the church sale,

19:45.186 --> 19:47.821
and she put in salt
instead of sugar!

19:47.856 --> 19:50.024
Yeah? And...?

19:50.058 --> 19:52.259
That's it.
That was the story.

19:52.294 --> 19:54.595
Where's that cake now?
It got sold.

19:54.629 --> 19:56.330
Who bought it?
Dr. Hibbert.

19:56.364 --> 19:59.900
Excuse me. I have to make a call.
Don't take too long.

20:01.703 --> 20:04.338
Okay, Hibbert's in surgery,
but they're having him paged.

20:07.175 --> 20:08.409
Wait, something's wrong.

20:08.443 --> 20:10.611
That's better.

20:10.645 --> 20:12.446
Oh, dear God.

20:17.724 --> 20:20.659
Hi, Ralph. Um, I just
wanted to tell you,

20:20.693 --> 20:23.729
there was a tooth
in the Valentine you gave me.

20:23.763 --> 20:26.331
Plant it and you'll
grow a new Ralph.

20:26.366 --> 20:29.468
I don't need a new Ralph.
I like the old one.

20:29.502 --> 20:31.103
Happy Valentine's Day.

20:31.137 --> 20:33.972
Well, better get ready
for St. Patrick's!
