WEBVTT

01:22.485 --> 01:23.686
Don't be stupid, Ed.

01:24.354 --> 01:28.057
How we supposed to operate if we can't
get the goddamn lights to work?

01:28.057 --> 01:30.293
I'll try and get an electrician
out there this afternoon.

01:30.293 --> 01:33.029
Yeah, you do that.
The fuck does this monkey want?

01:35.131 --> 01:36.433
Good morning.

01:38.501 --> 01:39.669
What do you want?

01:40.804 --> 01:42.105
To see your face.

01:43.206 --> 01:44.507
See my face?

01:49.078 --> 01:50.046
Have a good day.

01:54.250 --> 01:55.685
Goddamn it.

03:20.136 --> 03:21.905
Shit! Anita...

03:21.905 --> 03:24.707
Listen, I can be fast
or I can be smooth. I can't be both.

03:25.675 --> 03:27.310
I'm sorry. Come here. Let me see.

03:30.146 --> 03:31.314
I did a number on you.

03:33.917 --> 03:37.220
You know, save a lot of time
if we didn't have to stop

03:37.220 --> 03:38.988
by the boarding house
on mornings like this.

03:40.823 --> 03:43.860
Well, maybe I can keep
some clothes at your place.

03:43.860 --> 03:47.630
I... I was actually thinking maybe you
could just keep yourself at my place.

03:50.333 --> 03:51.467
How?

03:51.467 --> 03:54.504
We'd... We'd make it work.
There are plenty of women who do.

03:57.407 --> 03:59.576
I'd need to...
I'd need to think about it.

03:59.576 --> 04:01.811
Yes. Yes.

04:05.915 --> 04:07.050
Thanks again.

04:17.093 --> 04:21.297
So, Mr. Davenport, this gold coin
that Brooks McCutcheon was carrying,

04:21.297 --> 04:22.966
just how rare is it?

04:22.966 --> 04:25.902
There are only three
documented in existence.

04:25.902 --> 04:27.370
Who possesses the other two?

04:27.370 --> 04:30.406
According to our records
at the Numismatic Society,

04:30.406 --> 04:35.878
one is owned by the Carnegie family. The
other, Prince Gustaf Adolf of Sweden.

04:35.878 --> 04:39.716
So, the chances that our defendants
are acquaintances of the Carnegies

04:39.716 --> 04:42.619
or Prince Adolf are about
as rare as the coin itself.

04:42.619 --> 04:44.087
- Objection.
- Sustained.

04:46.189 --> 04:47.390
Thank you, Mr. Davenport.

04:48.391 --> 04:49.459
Mr. Mason?

04:50.259 --> 04:51.260
Mr. Mason!

04:53.162 --> 04:56.833
- No... No questions, Your Honor.
- Mr. Davenport, you may step down.

04:56.833 --> 04:59.636
Mr. Milligan, if you
will please call your next witness.

05:02.372 --> 05:05.208
Your Honor, at this time,
the people respectfully rest.

05:08.444 --> 05:09.512
Very well.

05:10.246 --> 05:13.750
Then this court shall stand
in recess until Thursday morning,

05:13.750 --> 05:16.119
at which time
the defense will begin their case.

05:26.663 --> 05:27.730
Full steam ahead.

05:28.698 --> 05:30.967
Milligan had
three more witnesses on his list.

05:32.035 --> 05:34.737
- Why'd they suddenly rest?
- I don't know.

05:35.538 --> 05:37.240
Well, it cuts into our prep time.

05:39.842 --> 05:42.278
Has Paul checked in
on the Ozzie Jackson lead?

05:43.579 --> 05:45.081
- Perry?
- What?

05:45.081 --> 05:47.717
If this train set thing
is throwing you off this much...

05:47.717 --> 05:50.253
- I'm fine.
- ...we could possibly tell the judge

05:50.253 --> 05:52.455
that someone is trying
to intimidate you.

05:52.455 --> 05:55.925
Although we have no proof
of who exactly.

05:57.326 --> 05:59.028
It's Lydell. Who else would it be?

05:59.662 --> 06:01.798
- I wouldn't be so sure.
- Why not?

06:01.798 --> 06:03.866
Because after what he said
to you at the racetrack,

06:03.866 --> 06:06.569
he doesn't strike me
as the type to fire warning shots.

06:09.872 --> 06:12.075
- I'll meet you back at the office.
- Good luck.

06:14.744 --> 06:15.978
Drink later?

06:20.016 --> 06:21.784
Nothing left to discuss.

06:21.784 --> 06:23.619
We can drink in silence then.

06:24.320 --> 06:26.155
- Another time.
- Ham?

06:26.556 --> 06:28.691
I know you can't tell me
why you offered the deal...

06:28.691 --> 06:29.692
I'm late.

06:30.393 --> 06:32.662
I just wanna know if you're all right.

06:34.697 --> 06:35.998
You can trust me.

06:38.768 --> 06:39.769
Always.

06:40.737 --> 06:42.271
Good luck with your defense.

06:50.246 --> 06:52.448
Come on! Yeah, take him down!

06:53.149 --> 06:54.350
Come on!

06:54.350 --> 06:56.652
Nah, that shoulder was down
more than a second.

06:57.086 --> 06:58.121
You got him.

07:00.022 --> 07:02.225
- This ain't work.
- Hey.

07:05.294 --> 07:07.330
- These them Serbs?
- Yeah.

07:08.731 --> 07:09.866
Big motherfuckers.

07:10.566 --> 07:11.601
I told you.

07:13.636 --> 07:14.971
What you doing around here?

07:16.072 --> 07:17.273
Any trucks come by?

07:18.207 --> 07:22.211
One, picked up three guys
for a quick sewer job in Venice.

07:22.211 --> 07:24.147
But... that's it.

07:25.615 --> 07:28.918
Probably better off. Don't nobody need
to be around you on days like that.

07:28.918 --> 07:30.086
Fuck you.

07:31.754 --> 07:32.688
Mo...

07:33.856 --> 07:36.259
I got something
a little less backbreaking for you.

07:36.893 --> 07:39.262
It ain't charity. It's legit.

07:41.063 --> 07:43.900
I need help from somebody I trust,
staking out a corner.

07:44.500 --> 07:47.804
- What you looking for?
- A hophead in a fancy blue car.

07:50.139 --> 07:51.841
- Pay?
- By the hour.

07:52.441 --> 07:55.344
Corner boys usually out
8:00 a.m. to 3:00 a.m.

07:55.344 --> 07:56.946
Figure you and I work in shifts.

07:58.447 --> 08:00.750
Mo, I need you
to write down everything you see.

08:00.750 --> 08:03.686
Don't matter if it don't seem like
it's gonna amount to nothing.

08:03.686 --> 08:05.822
You see it, you write it.

08:05.822 --> 08:09.492
Comings, goings,
license plates, everything.

08:11.794 --> 08:12.728
You good?

08:14.130 --> 08:15.565
- When's it start?
- Now.

08:16.199 --> 08:18.367
Taking Clara out
for our anniversary tonight.

08:19.001 --> 08:20.570
I got a nickel on this match.

08:24.006 --> 08:25.908
Fuck it. I never win anyway.

08:44.126 --> 08:46.495
That looks good. Hey, Marion, who...

08:46.495 --> 08:48.264
You know,
if you really wanna keep people out,

08:48.264 --> 08:49.832
you should install a double cylinder.

08:49.832 --> 08:51.934
Requires a key
on both sides of the door.

08:53.236 --> 08:57.306
That could come in handy for when
witnesses I subpoena show up.

08:59.041 --> 09:01.711
- I need a minute.
- Yeah, I figured.

09:03.512 --> 09:04.614
Marion...

09:17.927 --> 09:18.928
I...

09:21.230 --> 09:23.165
have some information
about Brooks McCutcheon

09:23.165 --> 09:24.967
I think you might find interesting.

09:27.103 --> 09:29.672
Are you trying
to bargain your way out of testifying?

09:29.672 --> 09:31.007
Yeah, I want off the list.

09:32.508 --> 09:36.212
You were Brooks' partner
on the only gambling ship

09:36.212 --> 09:38.314
that hasn't burned down.
I'm not passing this up.

09:38.314 --> 09:39.882
Yeah, well, here's the thing.

09:41.117 --> 09:42.985
Brooks was into something big.

09:44.487 --> 09:48.257
Bigger than you, Burger, or anyone
in this town is even thinking about.

09:48.257 --> 09:50.626
Now, lucky me,
I got a bunch of puzzle pieces...

09:52.128 --> 09:54.163
but I don't know
how they all fit together.

09:55.398 --> 09:57.133
And you were always such an...

09:58.634 --> 09:59.969
ace of an investigator.

09:59.969 --> 10:02.204
My God. You really are desperate.

10:02.204 --> 10:06.042
Look, this is the last fucking place
I wanna be right now, all right?

10:06.042 --> 10:09.712
If I'd figured out what Brooks was doing
I'd be pocketing the dough, believe me,

10:09.712 --> 10:10.780
but I didn't.

10:13.249 --> 10:14.216
So...

10:15.851 --> 10:20.256
I gotta figure out how to make this...
shit work for me somehow.

10:20.256 --> 10:21.490
Not gonna happen.

10:25.895 --> 10:27.530
You put me in that chair, Mason,

10:28.397 --> 10:31.767
make me talk about my sideline,
my entire life goes down the toilet.

10:33.569 --> 10:36.205
I lose my job. I lose my pension.

10:36.205 --> 10:39.875
If I don't put a case together, my
clients get a rope around their necks.

10:39.875 --> 10:41.577
I will take you down with me!

10:54.924 --> 10:57.360
You're gonna make Brooks
look like shit, right?

10:57.360 --> 10:59.528
So do I. All I ask...

11:00.296 --> 11:04.066
All I'm asking is you to come with me
and see for yourself what I found.

11:04.934 --> 11:09.572
And maybe... it'll
help sell your strategy.

11:29.058 --> 11:32.728
Truthfully, that desperate look
in your eye tells me

11:32.728 --> 11:37.099
you probably are being sincere,
but if I'm gonna go anywhere with you...

11:38.834 --> 11:39.802
I want insurance.

11:42.838 --> 11:44.707
What kind of insurance?

11:44.707 --> 11:47.777
Just an abuse of your power.
Nothing you can't handle.

12:03.926 --> 12:05.294
Jesus, Mason.

12:06.362 --> 12:07.930
What did you do?

12:36.725 --> 12:37.760
Fuck!

12:51.040 --> 12:52.274
How do you do, ma'am?

12:53.209 --> 12:56.045
Do the... Do the Petersons
still live on this floor?

12:56.045 --> 12:57.980
- No.
- My mistake.

13:00.749 --> 13:02.585
Have yourself a lovely day, ma'am.

13:18.467 --> 13:21.537
Paul, did you know
that Effie Harris got a job

13:21.537 --> 13:24.740
working down here
as one of those Creole chorus gals?

13:24.740 --> 13:25.908
Who?

13:25.908 --> 13:28.344
You know,
Effie Harris from down the street.

13:28.344 --> 13:31.413
Hell, she can't even walk
with them little chicken legs she got,

13:31.413 --> 13:33.516
let alone dance.

13:35.651 --> 13:38.554
Well, maybe this club's standards
have gone down.

13:38.554 --> 13:40.489
<i>- Not that I'm not happy...
- You've known me since a kid.</i>

13:40.489 --> 13:42.324
<i>You ain't gotta do this! No!</i>

13:42.324 --> 13:44.860
<i>- Please, man!
- Paul?</i>

13:44.860 --> 13:46.362
- Yeah.
- Put it away.

13:48.831 --> 13:51.167
I'm sorry, I'm just having a bad day.

13:51.834 --> 13:53.035
More than one.

13:53.602 --> 13:56.238
You been tossing and turning
the last couple of nights.

13:57.273 --> 13:58.541
Look, Clara,

13:58.541 --> 14:01.410
now, you know there ain't
nothing for you to worry about.

14:02.011 --> 14:03.746
'Cause tonight's just about us.

14:06.315 --> 14:07.449
We'll see.

14:11.387 --> 14:13.923
Hey, where'd you get them shoes?

14:13.923 --> 14:15.558
- What?
- Sneakers, Converse.

14:15.558 --> 14:16.859
- Where'd you get 'em from?
- I bought 'em.

14:16.859 --> 14:18.194
- What is it to you?
- Hey, hey, hey.

14:18.194 --> 14:19.762
- Paul...
- You get 'em off Ozzie Jackson?

14:19.762 --> 14:21.564
- No, what the f...
- No, no, no. Tell me the truth.

14:21.564 --> 14:22.598
- Don't lie to me.
- Paul!

14:22.598 --> 14:23.699
- I'm not.
- Paul!

14:23.699 --> 14:25.634
- What, Clara?
- What is the matter with you?

14:25.634 --> 14:28.304
Hey, hey!
Just mind your business right now.

14:37.046 --> 14:40.249
Okay. Well, let's just get back in line.

14:53.229 --> 14:54.830
Mason and Associates.

15:02.137 --> 15:04.073
No. It's all right.

15:06.709 --> 15:07.977
I'll come over shortly.

15:26.161 --> 15:27.896
- Have a good night.
- Thank you, miss.

15:29.999 --> 15:31.600
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

15:32.735 --> 15:35.170
Bar is to your left when you enter,

15:35.170 --> 15:37.673
lady of the house is upstairs,
off to your right.

15:38.274 --> 15:41.710
She's asked for three fingers
of gin with two ice cubes.

15:42.745 --> 15:45.781
- You're not staying?
- I'm due to meet my wife.

15:48.484 --> 15:49.585
My real wife.

16:05.301 --> 16:06.735
Miss Nygaard?

16:27.589 --> 16:28.557
Good.

16:52.181 --> 16:56.318
I decided it would be unconscionable
to keep Mieli's interpretation

16:56.318 --> 16:58.620
of Bizet to myself, and I thought,

16:58.620 --> 17:02.458
"Who do I know
in this vast, cultural wasteland

17:02.458 --> 17:04.693
who might actually hear it as I do?"

17:05.427 --> 17:08.630
- It is extraordinary.
- Please, sit.

17:13.001 --> 17:14.837
How's the trial of the century going?

17:15.838 --> 17:19.208
It's going about
as well as we could've hoped.

17:19.208 --> 17:20.709
I'm glad to hear it.

17:21.677 --> 17:24.680
I take it
you're working yourself to the bone?

17:24.680 --> 17:26.982
Even so, it never feels like enough.

17:27.883 --> 17:29.585
I just hope it's worth it.

17:33.422 --> 17:35.791
- May I ask you something?
- Of course.

17:35.791 --> 17:38.160
Have you any experience with marijuana?

17:39.027 --> 17:40.262
No.

17:40.262 --> 17:42.664
I've found it has
a marvelous calming effect.

17:46.735 --> 17:48.971
Is Mr. Mason behaving himself?

17:48.971 --> 17:52.141
Did you scold him
into submission after our lunch?

17:52.141 --> 17:53.842
He's behaving, more or less.

17:54.743 --> 17:56.845
The trial's been good for him.

17:56.845 --> 17:59.982
It's given him a clear adversary.

17:59.982 --> 18:04.420
I can't remember the last time
in my life something seemed so clear.

18:08.957 --> 18:10.559
I'm fine with my drink, thank you.

18:12.494 --> 18:14.430
- Would you?
- Of course.

18:31.046 --> 18:34.316
- Do you think I should fire Phippsy?
- I beg your pardon?

18:34.316 --> 18:36.785
He's distant.
There's something going on.

18:36.785 --> 18:40.556
He denies it, but there is.
It unsettles me.

18:43.759 --> 18:45.694
Don't be shy. I want your opinion.

18:45.694 --> 18:46.829
That's why I asked.

18:50.599 --> 18:54.837
From what I've seen,
he appears to be very dedicated.

18:54.837 --> 18:55.838
Plus...

18:56.905 --> 18:57.840
Yes?

18:58.807 --> 19:01.109
I imagine he knows
where the bodies are buried.

19:07.483 --> 19:10.752
Even worse, he knows my middle name.

19:13.322 --> 19:15.591
You're such a delight to talk to.

19:17.025 --> 19:19.428
We should find a way
to work together someday.

19:23.365 --> 19:26.301
- Another drink?
- I'm fine, thank you.

19:26.301 --> 19:27.769
No, but I would like one.

19:54.162 --> 19:55.197
Good afternoon.

19:57.266 --> 19:59.334
- Mason in?
- He's in the field.

19:59.968 --> 20:01.136
This is for him.

20:09.912 --> 20:11.246
How's Luisa?

20:11.246 --> 20:15.284
If you could see your Aunt Luisa,
you'd think she's a nun.

20:15.284 --> 20:18.153
She has everyone in the shanty praying
to the Santo Niño de Atocha

20:18.153 --> 20:19.254
ten times a day.

20:19.254 --> 20:21.790
That's only two more times
than she normally does.

20:23.458 --> 20:25.561
Maybe I should start praying
in here for you and Maria

20:25.561 --> 20:26.828
to survive her craziness.

20:31.366 --> 20:33.535
It's nice to see that smile
on your face.

20:34.703 --> 20:35.771
How's Rafa?

20:59.661 --> 21:00.729
No, no, no, no.

21:06.034 --> 21:08.303
And give her
something else to pray about?

21:08.303 --> 21:09.471
No, thank you.

21:11.273 --> 21:12.374
Mateo?

21:15.577 --> 21:16.745
I really miss you.

21:29.625 --> 21:31.827
"Petechial hemorrhage."
What does that mean?

21:31.827 --> 21:34.296
Blood vessels bursting
under the eyelids.

21:36.531 --> 21:38.800
I paid a visit
to our friend Virgil at the morgue.

21:38.800 --> 21:40.302
What'd it cost you?

21:40.302 --> 21:43.271
A buck and a promise
I would go and see him

21:43.271 --> 21:46.608
<i>in No, No, Nanette
at his community theater.</i>

21:46.608 --> 21:49.478
- Not enough alcohol in the world.
- Believe me.

21:49.478 --> 21:52.714
So, what does
"broken blood vessels" mean?

21:52.714 --> 21:56.852
Virg says, "choking" most likely.
There's no way it was a car accident.

21:57.586 --> 21:58.987
You think she was strangled?

22:00.722 --> 22:03.492
Lovers' quarrel?
Maybe Brooks lost his temper.

22:04.626 --> 22:06.628
Look, if we're gonna suggest

22:06.628 --> 22:09.264
Brooks McCutcheon strangled
a widowed secretary,

22:09.264 --> 22:11.299
we're gonna need more
than a few broken blood vessels.

22:11.299 --> 22:14.903
True. But all we really need
to do is get Vincent Taylor on the stand

22:14.903 --> 22:16.538
and see what he has to hide.

22:16.538 --> 22:18.707
As long as the jury think
he was involved somehow,

22:18.707 --> 22:20.275
we have our reasonable doubt.

22:21.677 --> 22:24.513
You... You'd need to tread lightly
with the female jurors.

22:25.380 --> 22:27.049
Maybe I should prepare the questions.

22:27.049 --> 22:29.451
Sure. Just don't tread too lightly.

22:31.186 --> 22:33.755
Would be nice if we had something
that definitively tied Brooks

22:33.755 --> 22:35.257
to Noreen's "accident."

22:35.257 --> 22:37.926
True, the file's nice,
but it's no smoking gun.

22:37.926 --> 22:39.895
No, the smoking gun's in our safe.

22:41.630 --> 22:42.664
- Mr. Mason?
- Yeah?

22:42.664 --> 22:44.399
Miss Aimes is here to see you.

22:44.399 --> 22:48.437
Yes. H... Hi! Hi! I'll be right out.

22:50.806 --> 22:52.574
Ginny, this is Della Street,
my colleague.

22:52.574 --> 22:54.743
Della, this is Ginny Aimes.

22:54.743 --> 22:56.945
- It's nice to meet you.
- You as well.

22:56.945 --> 23:00.382
- Yeah, so, I'll be right there.
- I'll hold him to that.

23:02.984 --> 23:06.722
So, Holcomb said he would...
he would talk to a waitress

23:06.722 --> 23:08.457
that was close to Brooks on the Morocco.

23:08.457 --> 23:09.958
There might be something there.

23:09.958 --> 23:12.360
Kind of Brooks
to leave us a trail of mistresses.

23:12.360 --> 23:15.530
And maybe Marion can do
some more background on Taylor.

23:15.530 --> 23:16.631
- Couldn't hurt.
- Hey.

23:16.631 --> 23:18.166
Yeah.

23:18.166 --> 23:19.868
Nice work. She's tasty.

23:20.602 --> 23:21.803
My God.

23:59.808 --> 24:00.809
Thank you.

24:02.043 --> 24:04.813
So, do you come here a lot?

24:04.813 --> 24:06.648
A few times.

24:06.648 --> 24:08.784
A man I dated introduced it to me.

24:09.518 --> 24:11.520
Was he... Was he Japanese?

24:11.520 --> 24:13.355
- Dutch, actually.
- Dutch.

24:14.756 --> 24:19.528
There's sesame and ponzu sauce,
which is basically soy sauce.

24:19.528 --> 24:20.562
All right.

24:24.266 --> 24:25.400
Not for you?

24:30.505 --> 24:32.607
How long has Della been working for you?

24:33.275 --> 24:37.412
Starting to think I work for her.
We've known each other many years.

24:37.412 --> 24:38.814
Were you two ever...

24:41.650 --> 24:43.385
- No.
- What?

24:44.886 --> 24:48.023
What... No, no, nothing.
We're... We're just... We're different.

24:49.057 --> 24:50.058
Yeah.

24:50.926 --> 24:54.629
- Well, you seem to work well together.
- Yeah, we do, for the most part.

24:57.065 --> 25:02.904
I heard her describe me
as "tasty," which was a first.

25:07.042 --> 25:09.010
If I picked this up,
it would be a first.

25:11.346 --> 25:12.280
No.

25:13.515 --> 25:14.783
I had a big lunch.

25:14.783 --> 25:16.952
- I don't want you to go hungry.
- Thanks.

25:24.826 --> 25:27.529
Can I try another?
And I'll... I'll give you my verdict.

25:28.463 --> 25:32.067
- Can't get enough? Oh God.
- Tricky, right?

26:02.697 --> 26:06.668
"J... T... R...

26:07.502 --> 26:10.605
three... five... eight."

26:29.557 --> 26:31.192
<i>Councilman Taylor,</i>

26:31.760 --> 26:33.895
when were you first elected?

26:33.895 --> 26:35.664
1927.

26:35.664 --> 26:39.034
And when were you first introduced
to Brooks McCutcheon?

26:40.035 --> 26:43.505
- Can't say exactly.
- Before or after you were elected?

26:43.505 --> 26:45.707
- Before, I believe.
- You believe?

26:46.274 --> 26:49.311
Didn't Brooks make
a contribution to your campaign?

26:50.278 --> 26:53.114
I have a newspaper article here
with a very nice photograph

26:53.114 --> 26:54.649
of you both at a fundraiser.

26:56.384 --> 26:57.819
He did make a contribution.

26:57.819 --> 27:00.555
Yeah, a very generous one,
from what we discovered.

27:00.555 --> 27:03.525
You... You outspent your opponent!

27:03.525 --> 27:05.393
- By at least double.
- Objection.

27:05.393 --> 27:07.028
What's the relevance of this?

27:07.028 --> 27:10.532
I think it's relevant to understand how
close the witness was to the deceased

27:10.532 --> 27:11.900
in the narrative of my questioning.

27:11.900 --> 27:13.335
- Is this it?
- Overruled.

27:13.335 --> 27:15.470
- Thank you.
- This confirms the numbers.

27:15.470 --> 27:17.372
McCutcheon Stadium...

27:18.540 --> 27:19.874
your district, correct?

27:19.874 --> 27:20.875
It is.

27:20.875 --> 27:23.278
How much of Brooks McCutcheon's
contribution to your campaign went

27:23.278 --> 27:24.913
into guaranteeing zoning permits?

27:24.913 --> 27:26.748
- Objection.
- I withdraw the question.

27:30.118 --> 27:32.253
Councilman, who is Noreen Lawson?

27:32.887 --> 27:35.090
- She's my sister.
- Is she married?

27:35.657 --> 27:38.626
Widowed. Husband died a few years back.

27:39.094 --> 27:40.762
- Cancer.
- Very sorry to hear that.

27:41.529 --> 27:44.866
Where did Noreen go to work
after her husband passed?

27:44.866 --> 27:48.203
- McCutcheon Shipping.
- Who's the head of McCutcheon Shipping?

27:48.803 --> 27:49.904
Brooks McCutcheon.

27:50.572 --> 27:54.743
Did Noreen and Brooks know each other
in the shipping office?

27:54.743 --> 27:58.279
She was one of several girls
in the stenographic pool there, so...

27:59.180 --> 28:00.215
I couldn't say.

28:01.583 --> 28:03.752
Councilman, where is Noreen today?

28:06.921 --> 28:08.456
San Haven.

28:08.456 --> 28:11.893
Would you please tell the court
what San Haven is exactly?

28:13.561 --> 28:17.599
- A convalescent home.
- Excuse me, Counselor, a word?

28:19.534 --> 28:20.769
- Your Honor?
- Make it quick.

28:20.769 --> 28:21.803
Yes.

28:24.339 --> 28:25.707
Let me take it from here.

28:27.342 --> 28:28.977
Take what from here?

28:28.977 --> 28:31.012
I think I should finish
questioning Taylor.

28:31.012 --> 28:32.313
What?

28:32.313 --> 28:33.948
We've lost three, five, and eight.

28:33.948 --> 28:35.583
I think this would be best
coming from a woman

28:35.850 --> 28:37.685
that we have further evidence
that I doubt...

28:37.685 --> 28:40.188
- Mr. Mason?
- Yes! Yes, Your Honor.

28:41.456 --> 28:42.724
With the court's permission,

28:42.724 --> 28:45.260
I would like Miss Street
to finish questioning the witness.

28:45.260 --> 28:46.961
- Sidebar.
- Both sides approach.

28:50.065 --> 28:52.634
I'm not a fan of theatrics
in my courtroom, Mason.

28:52.634 --> 28:53.601
Nor am I, Judge,

28:53.601 --> 28:56.504
but this is more due to
the sensitive nature of this testimony.

28:56.504 --> 28:57.639
I would also like to add,

28:57.639 --> 28:59.774
Miss Street has been serving
an apprenticeship with me.

28:59.774 --> 29:01.242
Apprenticeship?

29:01.242 --> 29:02.777
She's not even a real attorney.

29:02.777 --> 29:04.245
Some make the same argument about you.

29:04.245 --> 29:06.214
Your Honor, I believe
the women in this courtroom

29:06.214 --> 29:09.084
would be far more comfortable
if the questioning did come

29:09.084 --> 29:10.185
from Miss Street.

29:10.185 --> 29:11.352
I would also like to add,

29:11.352 --> 29:14.089
the questions for the witness
were prepared well in advance.

29:16.591 --> 29:18.893
- I'll allow it, but...
- Under... Understood.

29:18.893 --> 29:20.161
Thank you.

29:23.231 --> 29:24.732
- Miss Street.
- Thank you.

29:26.468 --> 29:27.535
You sure?

29:29.003 --> 29:30.004
All yours.

29:34.943 --> 29:36.177
Take your time.

29:42.016 --> 29:43.284
Councilman Taylor,

29:44.185 --> 29:46.521
can you identify
the woman in this photograph?

29:48.490 --> 29:49.724
That's Noreen.

29:49.724 --> 29:51.726
Has she always been in a wheelchair?

29:52.861 --> 29:54.062
No.

29:54.062 --> 29:57.665
In fact, she wasn't confined to one
until she was admitted to San Haven.

29:57.665 --> 29:58.700
Is that correct?

29:59.400 --> 30:00.335
Yes.

30:01.069 --> 30:03.972
- Can you tell us what happened to her?
- Objection!

30:03.972 --> 30:06.741
This line of questioning
has absolutely no relevance

30:06.741 --> 30:07.976
to the guilt of the defendants.

30:07.976 --> 30:09.477
It absolutely does.

30:09.477 --> 30:11.579
The defendants are entitled
to present a full picture

30:11.579 --> 30:13.982
of the circumstances
of Mr. McCutcheon's passing.

30:13.982 --> 30:17.485
And humiliate a productive member
of this city in the process?

30:17.485 --> 30:18.753
Him or you?

30:21.623 --> 30:24.125
I think Mr. Mason's rubbing off
on you too much.

30:24.392 --> 30:25.894
- Quicken it up.
- Yes, Your Honor.

30:25.894 --> 30:27.862
The witness will answer the question.

30:27.862 --> 30:29.397
What happened to your sister?

30:30.732 --> 30:33.368
- She was in a car accident.
- A car accident?

30:34.669 --> 30:38.006
I'm sorry, that must have been awful.
What happened exactly?

30:38.006 --> 30:39.707
She went through the windshield.

30:39.707 --> 30:41.276
So, it was a head injury then?

30:42.410 --> 30:45.013
From what I understand, yes, it was.

30:45.013 --> 30:46.014
I see.

30:47.348 --> 30:52.820
Well, that's interesting
because in Noreen's medical records,

30:52.820 --> 30:55.490
there is no mention of a head injury.

30:55.490 --> 30:59.561
And she doesn't have
a single scar on her head or her face,

30:59.561 --> 31:01.930
which she would have
had she gone through a windshield,

31:01.930 --> 31:03.631
as you just testified.

31:04.332 --> 31:08.536
The report does state, however,
that her brain was deprived of oxygen

31:08.536 --> 31:11.773
long enough to cause
severe, irreversible damage.

31:11.773 --> 31:14.909
Well, I... I'm not a doctor.
What do you want from me?

31:14.909 --> 31:18.880
A little more thoughtfulness on how
you answer my questions, Councilman.

31:18.880 --> 31:20.748
- Objection!
- Sustained.

31:20.748 --> 31:22.951
Miss Street, tread lightly.

31:23.885 --> 31:25.119
We'll come back to this.

31:29.958 --> 31:33.061
Can you identify what I'm holding?

31:34.662 --> 31:35.830
A belt.

31:35.830 --> 31:38.733
And right here on the inside
of this belt is a monogram.

31:39.634 --> 31:41.135
Can you read the letter for me?

31:42.470 --> 31:44.239
-"M."
-"M."

31:45.173 --> 31:46.140
For "McCutcheon."

31:47.041 --> 31:49.110
Because this is indeed his belt.

31:50.044 --> 31:52.347
The belt he was wearing
when he was murdered.

31:53.014 --> 31:56.384
The same belt I believe he used
when he strangled your sister.

31:56.384 --> 31:58.720
Objection!
The murder victim's not on trial here.

31:58.720 --> 32:02.290
- Overruled. Let's see where this goes.
- You don't know that.

32:02.290 --> 32:06.661
Well, according to other witnesses, who
have given a sworn written testimony...

32:08.029 --> 32:12.934
Brooks McCutcheon liked
to surprise women during coitus.

32:14.068 --> 32:18.106
He would put his belt
around the woman's neck, like so,

32:18.840 --> 32:22.343
and then he would begin to tighten it.

32:23.411 --> 32:25.747
And he would not let up
until he wanted to.

32:26.581 --> 32:29.584
Even if the woman
was desperately gasping for air.

32:34.922 --> 32:37.558
Which was your sister's case, wasn't it?

32:49.404 --> 32:52.073
This is a close-up photo
of Noreen's neck taken

32:52.073 --> 32:54.242
when she was admitted
to San Haven, correct?

32:54.542 --> 32:55.643
Yes.

32:55.643 --> 32:58.479
Can you make out something
here on her skin?

32:59.514 --> 33:01.182
Yes, a mark.

33:01.182 --> 33:03.351
And what does
the mark resemble, Councilman?

33:05.186 --> 33:06.254
An "M."

33:08.089 --> 33:09.223
An "M."

33:18.566 --> 33:21.536
And so, I refer
to my earlier question, Councilman...

33:22.670 --> 33:25.340
what honestly happened to your sister?

33:27.942 --> 33:30.211
And I'd like to remind you,
you're under oath.

33:35.850 --> 33:37.885
- She was strangled.
- Pardon?

33:44.459 --> 33:45.393
She was strangled.

33:47.962 --> 33:51.966
Order. Order! Order!

33:54.435 --> 33:57.038
You must have hated Brooks
for what he did.

33:57.939 --> 34:02.610
Turning your vivacious sister
into a shell of a woman.

34:02.610 --> 34:04.112
It was accidental.

34:04.812 --> 34:09.183
Did you or did you not threaten his life
at a party on July 4th, 1932,

34:09.183 --> 34:10.651
at the Oceano Club?

34:10.651 --> 34:12.520
- I don't know.
- Did you not brandish a gun?

34:12.520 --> 34:14.122
<i>Because according
to the Malibu Register...</i>

34:14.122 --> 34:17.492
I was drunk.
It was... I got a little out of hand.

34:17.492 --> 34:18.559
A little out of hand?

34:18.559 --> 34:21.629
-"I'll kill the perverted bastard."
- I never said that!

34:25.299 --> 34:28.903
What? We... We... We...
we're gonna take this rag as gospel?

34:28.903 --> 34:31.205
<i>Who's even heard of the Malibu Register?</i>

34:31.205 --> 34:32.640
All right, what did you say?

34:42.183 --> 34:43.317
I don't remember.

34:43.317 --> 34:46.654
Like you didn't remember
Brooks strangled your sister?

34:46.654 --> 34:48.456
- Objection!
- Sustained.

34:48.456 --> 34:49.724
Nothing further.

34:52.593 --> 34:54.796
This court will stand in recess.

34:59.767 --> 35:00.835
I'm buying.

35:30.798 --> 35:33.401
<i>- Operator.
- Olympia, 1-3-8-1.</i>

35:33.401 --> 35:34.602
<i>Please hold.</i>

35:37.138 --> 35:38.539
<i>Anita St. Pierre.</i>

35:38.539 --> 35:40.374
<i>- Hey.
- Well, hello.</i>

35:42.076 --> 35:45.413
I just had to tell you
I had the most incredible day.

35:45.413 --> 35:48.549
<i>- Good, I can't wait to hear.
- And I can't wait to tell you.</i>

35:48.549 --> 35:51.285
<i>I thought I could come by,
bring a bottle of wine,</i>

35:51.986 --> 35:54.388
and all of my things.

36:18.513 --> 36:19.580
Can we talk?

36:24.652 --> 36:25.753
Please.

36:43.137 --> 36:45.673
- What are you doing?
- Collecting my stuff.

36:48.042 --> 36:49.110
Rafa!

36:49.477 --> 36:50.645
It's not over.

36:52.213 --> 36:53.281
We can't lose.

36:53.848 --> 36:55.483
You saw the jury's faces.

36:55.917 --> 36:58.185
I... I was worried when...
when Mason handed over

36:58.185 --> 37:01.188
to Miss Street, but shit,
she's tougher than him.

37:01.656 --> 37:04.825
We're going home, Brother.
We're going home.

37:04.825 --> 37:05.927
Shut it up!

37:06.727 --> 37:07.795
- Fuck you!
- Rafa!

37:07.795 --> 37:10.464
What did you say,
you fucking bean eater?

37:10.464 --> 37:11.866
You think that's offensive?

37:12.667 --> 37:15.102
- I'm proud of being Mexican.
- It's enough. Be quiet, Rafael.

37:15.102 --> 37:17.939
He doesn't know what he's talking about.
He hasn't been feeling...

37:17.939 --> 37:19.774
- Open 14.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.

37:19.774 --> 37:23.244
Just... Just... Just let me talk
to him. Let me talk to him. Just...

37:24.412 --> 37:26.047
You don't have to treat him like that.

37:26.047 --> 37:27.315
Hey, just... Wait!

37:29.116 --> 37:30.551
Come on, just let me talk to him.

37:30.551 --> 37:31.552
Fuck you!

37:32.386 --> 37:33.521
Take him to the hole.

37:38.593 --> 37:40.361
Rafa, it's gonna be all right, Rafa!

37:43.130 --> 37:47.335
I made it clear just how important
this sort of information is to me...

37:48.269 --> 37:49.337
to this case.

37:50.438 --> 37:53.140
We can't be going into the rest
of their defense blind.

37:54.742 --> 37:55.710
Yeah?

37:56.444 --> 37:59.647
And I think you know by now,
Mason, he ain't no rube.

37:59.647 --> 38:01.148
He knows someone's onto him.

38:03.985 --> 38:04.986
Peter...

38:06.654 --> 38:09.624
you've proven yourself
to be a strong asset to this office.

38:09.624 --> 38:13.194
The boys in your department talk
about just how devious you can be

38:13.194 --> 38:14.528
to get what you need.

38:15.496 --> 38:17.164
- It's the job.
- It is.

38:18.399 --> 38:19.734
I certainly couldn't do it.

38:21.302 --> 38:22.670
Takes a particular type.

38:29.910 --> 38:31.746
I can see how you rubbed off on Mason.

38:33.948 --> 38:38.085
But do you really want Mason
to think that he's smarter than you?

38:41.689 --> 38:43.157
Unless, of course, he is.

38:46.293 --> 38:48.062
Find me something I can use.

39:16.824 --> 39:18.125
You like seagulls, Mason?

39:19.727 --> 39:23.230
- I don't really have an opinion.
- Nasty fuckers.

39:24.398 --> 39:25.800
Scavengers, really.

39:26.667 --> 39:28.602
Pull a hot dog right out of your hand.

39:34.809 --> 39:35.843
Well...

39:38.546 --> 39:39.747
take 'em or leave 'em.

39:42.616 --> 39:44.318
Still don't trust me
after what I brought you?

39:44.318 --> 39:45.319
Not a chance.

40:10.745 --> 40:11.812
Let's go.

40:16.350 --> 40:18.285
Ships got loaded up in Long Beach.

40:18.886 --> 40:21.756
When Brooks was alive,
they'd head up towards Port Hueneme,

40:21.756 --> 40:22.990
just south of Santa Barbara.

40:22.990 --> 40:24.125
Why?

40:24.125 --> 40:26.093
Well, Brooks was paying fellas
under the table

40:26.093 --> 40:27.728
to unload the produce there.

40:27.728 --> 40:31.098
You know, sold it around,
made a couple of bucks.

40:31.799 --> 40:35.736
And got in cahoots
with this guy named Goldstein.

40:35.736 --> 40:37.738
What does he have to say about all this?

40:38.739 --> 40:39.940
Not much.

40:39.940 --> 40:42.576
He was butchered four days
after Brooks was killed.

40:43.978 --> 40:47.681
After that, that's when all the ships
stopped going up there altogether.

40:49.116 --> 40:52.820
If the ships are no longer going
up to Hueneme, where are they going?

40:52.820 --> 40:54.455
Well, maybe they could tell us.

40:59.727 --> 41:01.362
Holy shit.

41:18.078 --> 41:19.013
That's oil.

41:20.481 --> 41:21.515
Yep.

41:26.554 --> 41:27.855
- Oil?
- Yes.

41:28.956 --> 41:31.992
This is what Lydell's been
covering up this whole time.

41:31.992 --> 41:35.863
Not some bullshit about protecting
the McCutcheon family name.

41:35.863 --> 41:37.631
But... But what is he covering up?

41:37.631 --> 41:39.633
That-- I don't know! Yet.

41:40.868 --> 41:42.469
So, how does this help our case?

41:42.469 --> 41:44.672
Well, that's what I'm gonna find out.

41:44.672 --> 41:46.941
I'm thinking we should rest.

41:48.108 --> 41:50.211
- Are... Are you being serious?
- Yeah.

41:50.211 --> 41:53.881
We have what we wanted.
We undermined the prosecution's case.

41:53.881 --> 41:57.051
We tore apart Vincent Taylor.
We have our reasonable doubt.

41:57.051 --> 41:59.019
Yes, and this morning,
I might have agreed with you,

41:59.019 --> 42:00.054
but, Della, we...

42:00.054 --> 42:03.190
I'm just worried that the more we
prolong this, the more exposed we are.

42:03.190 --> 42:07.595
Look how we're exposing Lydell.
Look what you just did to Taylor.

42:07.595 --> 42:09.630
No, no, no. We gotta keep going.

42:31.886 --> 42:32.987
What are you doing?

42:35.489 --> 42:37.091
Waiting for your damn brother.

42:38.759 --> 42:39.793
What time is it?

42:43.664 --> 42:44.598
3:30 a.m.

42:46.367 --> 42:48.068
The man should've been back by now.

42:48.869 --> 42:50.604
You think something happened?

42:50.604 --> 42:52.006
I don't know, Clara.

42:52.006 --> 42:54.174
Well, you think maybe
you need to go look?

43:01.582 --> 43:03.484
- What you doing up?
- Did you see it?

43:05.653 --> 43:08.355
- No.
- Nothing?

43:09.089 --> 43:10.724
I just said I didn't, Paul.

43:11.558 --> 43:13.794
- Give me the notebook.
- Here.

43:14.528 --> 43:16.497
I need to hit the sack, all right?

43:16.497 --> 43:19.133
My eyes are killing me
from all that squinting.

43:19.133 --> 43:21.201
Wait, wait, Mo. Mo...

43:21.201 --> 43:22.803
Mo, what is this?

43:22.803 --> 43:25.572
It's the license plate numbers
of anybody that stopped.

43:26.173 --> 43:28.676
Look, it was dark in the car.
I'll tell you them all in the morning.

43:28.676 --> 43:30.978
All right, you get the color, right?

43:30.978 --> 43:33.013
Right there next to the license number.

43:33.013 --> 43:34.114
But what about the make?

43:35.582 --> 43:36.784
I couldn't always tell.

43:38.018 --> 43:39.153
I got a few of 'em.

43:40.254 --> 43:41.188
A few?

43:41.622 --> 43:43.524
What's the matter? You got the license.

43:44.391 --> 43:46.193
But what did I tell you to do?

43:46.193 --> 43:49.663
- If you see it, you fucking write it.
- And I did.

43:50.197 --> 43:52.199
Shit, all the comings
and goings of all the people.

43:52.199 --> 43:53.233
Hell, I even wrote down

43:53.233 --> 43:55.502
when the fucking corner boys
ate a goddamn jelly sandwich!

43:55.502 --> 43:56.737
What the fuck more do you want?

43:56.737 --> 43:58.706
For you to not act like
a goddamn ditch digger.

43:58.706 --> 44:00.040
- Hey.
- Fuck you, man!

44:00.040 --> 44:01.241
Hey, Paul!

44:04.311 --> 44:05.713
Are you losing your mind?

44:07.047 --> 44:09.283
Who in the hell
do you think you're talking to?

44:11.018 --> 44:14.121
What you... You picking his side now?

44:14.121 --> 44:16.757
You mind how you talk
to my brother in his house.

44:19.526 --> 44:20.694
What's going on?

44:21.762 --> 44:23.998
What the... Nothing.

45:05.672 --> 45:08.675
Councilman Vincent Taylor
will return for cross-examination.

45:08.675 --> 45:10.878
Your Honor,
permission to approach the bench?

45:22.022 --> 45:25.893
Your Honor, something pressing
and rather upsetting

45:25.893 --> 45:26.994
has come to my attention.

45:26.994 --> 45:30.330
I have credible
and newly discovered information

45:30.330 --> 45:33.267
that Mr. Mason is actively
concealing the murder weapon

45:33.267 --> 45:34.735
in his private safe at his office.

45:34.735 --> 45:36.904
In my chambers. Now.

45:40.641 --> 45:41.642
After you.

45:50.818 --> 45:53.120
- What's going on?
- I'm not sure.

46:00.594 --> 46:01.862
I warned the two of you.

46:01.862 --> 46:05.532
I will not have this trial turn
into a goddamn circus!

46:05.532 --> 46:06.834
It's not my intention, Your Honor.

46:06.834 --> 46:11.605
And yet here I am trying to control
you two fucking clowns. Jesus!

46:12.272 --> 46:13.507
Well, Counselor...

46:15.509 --> 46:17.377
is Milligan's allegation true?

46:17.377 --> 46:20.114
Your Honor, I would... I would like
to speak with my colleague, Miss Street.

46:20.114 --> 46:21.515
I... I believe there's precedence here.

46:21.515 --> 46:23.117
That sounds like an affirmative,
Your Honor.

46:23.117 --> 46:25.018
I would like to request
a court order for Mr. Mason

46:25.018 --> 46:26.420
to surrender the gun.

46:26.420 --> 46:29.490
Given Mr. Mason's disrespect
for this court

46:29.490 --> 46:31.158
and flagrant disregard of rules,

46:31.158 --> 46:33.694
I don't believe
a court order would be sufficient.

46:34.528 --> 46:37.898
Instead, we will all take a field trip.

46:37.898 --> 46:39.833
A... A field trip?

46:40.134 --> 46:41.235
To your office.

46:55.482 --> 46:57.518
The jury will adjourn for the day,

46:57.784 --> 47:00.621
and this trial shall stand
at recess until tomorrow.

47:03.423 --> 47:04.358
What?

47:06.660 --> 47:07.661
How bad?

48:20.200 --> 48:21.134
Open it.

48:21.868 --> 48:23.870
Your Honor, I have a question
about admissibility...

48:23.870 --> 48:27.474
I don't. Open the safe, Mr. Mason. Now!

48:35.115 --> 48:37.818
Bailiff, if you would look
for the weapon, please.

48:49.763 --> 48:52.766
Your Honor, the people request
a short amount of time

48:52.766 --> 48:54.968
to perform ballistics testing
on the gun.

48:54.968 --> 48:56.136
Granted.

48:56.136 --> 48:58.105
Your Honor,
we hope that by handling this privately,

48:58.105 --> 48:59.773
away from the jury,
we've avoided a mistrial.

48:59.773 --> 49:04.745
Also, we request that Mr. Mason be held
in contempt and taken into custody

49:04.745 --> 49:05.779
for concealing evidence.

49:05.779 --> 49:08.582
That won't be necessary at this time,

49:08.582 --> 49:11.285
but it is certainly not off the table.

49:12.152 --> 49:15.322
I want you both in my chambers
tomorrow morning, 9:00 a.m.

49:18.125 --> 49:20.994
Let me know if you need
the name of a good public defender.

49:37.844 --> 49:41.448
You know, they're making listening
devices smaller and smaller these days.

49:46.186 --> 49:49.356
Here, here. "Olmstead vs. the U.S. The

49:49.356 --> 49:53.093
dissent argues for a wider application
of the exclusionary principle."

49:53.093 --> 49:54.328
It's post-Mayen.

49:54.328 --> 49:58.665
Maybe Durkin would be open
to the illegal search and seizure angle.

49:58.665 --> 50:00.100
You talk to Anita about work?

50:05.806 --> 50:07.841
- Sometimes.
- You ever talk about the case?

50:08.709 --> 50:09.810
Seriously?

50:11.211 --> 50:13.714
What... Did you tell Clara
when you found the gun?

50:14.514 --> 50:15.749
Careful now, Perry.

50:17.351 --> 50:18.318
Sorry.

50:24.491 --> 50:26.960
You're being absurd.
Well, someone tipped Milligan off.

50:26.960 --> 50:28.695
I'm willing to bet
it wasn't the Gallardos.

50:28.695 --> 50:30.797
Are you sure
there hadn't been anybody else in here?

50:30.797 --> 50:33.133
Kids delivering sandwiches, anything?

50:48.782 --> 50:51.385
Are you looking
for someone in particular, Mr. Mason?

50:59.226 --> 51:00.394
This is a nice surprise...

51:00.394 --> 51:04.664
I'm gonna ask you something,
and I need you to tell me the truth.

51:06.133 --> 51:07.134
Okay.

51:08.368 --> 51:09.469
Was it you?

51:11.171 --> 51:12.439
Was what me?

51:13.740 --> 51:17.778
When you were in my office the other
day, what... what did you overhear?

51:19.613 --> 51:23.049
Nothing. I... I spoke
to your secretary for a...

51:23.049 --> 51:26.219
No, no, no. When Della and I were
talking what did you overhear?

51:28.622 --> 51:29.656
Nothing.

51:32.092 --> 51:35.695
Ginny, the prosecution found
the murder weapon in my safe.

51:35.695 --> 51:38.932
You were the only other person
signed into that logbook.

51:38.932 --> 51:41.067
Why was the murder weapon
in your safe, Perry?

51:41.067 --> 51:43.804
Don't... Don't do that.
Don't... Don't play dumb with me

51:43.804 --> 51:46.673
'cause if I find out
you're... you're lying, I will...

51:46.673 --> 51:47.674
What?

51:49.376 --> 51:50.477
You'll do what?

51:54.648 --> 51:56.149
You were in my office,

51:56.683 --> 51:58.418
and you overheard
what we were talking about.

51:58.418 --> 51:59.453
I didn't hear anything.

51:59.453 --> 52:02.022
Do you honestly think
that I would do something like that?

52:10.464 --> 52:11.431
Okay.

52:13.900 --> 52:17.204
Why don't you sit down?
I'll make you a drink.

52:18.171 --> 52:20.207
And you can start at the beginning,

52:20.207 --> 52:23.376
and I will try to understand
what the hell you're talking about.

52:23.376 --> 52:24.711
You are so full of shit.

53:17.130 --> 53:18.331
There you are.

53:37.817 --> 53:39.019
Hey! Hey!

53:53.700 --> 53:56.503
No. No.
