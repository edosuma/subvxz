<i>Previously on "Shades of Blue"...</i>

00:01.547 --> 00:02.314
<i>Put your hands up.</i>

00:02.348 --> 00:03.315
This is not what it looks like.

00:03.349 --> 00:04.572
It looks like you're robbing
an armored truck

00:04.606 --> 00:05.682
filled with DA money.

00:05.717 --> 00:07.737
This isn't our heist.
It's Donnie Pomp's,

00:07.762 --> 00:08.962
<i>the Internal Affairs officer.</i>

00:08.996 --> 00:09.763
Wozniak isn't here.

00:09.797 --> 00:10.563
What were you doing in his house?

00:10.598 --> 00:11.965
There's something you should see.

00:13.734 --> 00:15.902
<i>It's your dead body. It's your decision.</i>

00:15.936 --> 00:17.570
I just want to make sure
we don't have any cracks.

00:17.605 --> 00:18.905
Whoa, you're saying
that I would rat out my crew?

00:18.939 --> 00:20.373
Everybody has their limit.

00:20.408 --> 00:21.541
Oh, I'm solid.

00:21.575 --> 00:24.244
- What now?
- Behold, your share.

00:24.278 --> 00:26.713
- Cristina.
- Your dad hired his law firm.

00:26.747 --> 00:29.716
If you hear from Miguel,
could you let me know?

00:32.753 --> 00:33.953
<i>Hi, it's me.</i>

00:33.988 --> 00:35.755
- You have a "Hi, it's me"?
- Caroline.

00:35.790 --> 00:36.923
<i>- Ex-fiancée?
- I don't think</i>

00:36.957 --> 00:38.591
I've seen you before.

00:38.626 --> 00:39.592
Are you new?

00:39.627 --> 00:40.460
Not that new.

00:40.494 --> 00:42.729
Politics. There's always a price.

00:42.763 --> 00:44.831
Take Bianchi, it's quid pro quo.

00:44.865 --> 00:46.499
Hey! Tommy, what the hell's
the matter with you?

00:46.534 --> 00:47.500
I'm sorry.

00:47.535 --> 00:48.468
<i>How about the name</i>

00:48.502 --> 00:50.770
of whoever suggested
this little frame-up?

00:50.805 --> 00:52.305
Anonymous tip.

Teslin paper.

01:06.287 --> 01:10.457
As close to PVC stock
as you can get commercially.

01:10.491 --> 01:12.959
You know, the trick
to New York State is a hologram.

01:12.993 --> 01:14.928
They can't make anything easy.

01:17.498 --> 01:18.965
Scans at all major checkpoints.

01:18.999 --> 01:21.034
Wow. That's something.

01:21.068 --> 01:23.536
Good photo to work with.
Not like the back alley shots

01:23.571 --> 01:24.838
we usually get.

01:24.872 --> 01:26.439
Looks official. Who took it?

01:26.474 --> 01:27.941
New York Police Department.

01:27.975 --> 01:29.542
- Hey!
- NYPD!

01:29.577 --> 01:30.944
- Nobody get stupid now!
- Let's see hands!

01:33.981 --> 01:36.049
- Any other rooms?
- You're the cop.

01:36.083 --> 01:37.484
Tell me, and I won't arrest you.

01:37.518 --> 01:39.519
Serious? Uhh, 12 through 16.

01:39.553 --> 01:40.887
Thanks.

01:40.921 --> 01:42.622
Espada.

01:42.656 --> 01:43.690
Come on. Let's go.

01:43.724 --> 01:45.725
Hey! Hey, you said
you weren't gonna arrest me.

01:45.760 --> 01:47.026
I'm not. He is.

01:47.061 --> 01:48.962
- Tufo.
- 12 through 16.

01:48.996 --> 01:50.397
One-man search party.

01:50.431 --> 01:51.798
Loman, start taking out the trash.

01:51.832 --> 01:53.066
- I'm on it.
- Espada?

01:53.100 --> 01:54.734
- Yeah?
- Stay here.

02:01.409 --> 02:02.809
14 clear!

02:08.848 --> 02:09.983
All right, let me lead with this:

02:10.017 --> 02:12.051
I don't like sudden movements.

02:12.086 --> 02:13.319
Are you working with these guys?

02:13.354 --> 02:15.422
I'm sorry. My boyfriend said I could

02:15.456 --> 02:17.824
just earn some extra cash
doing Photoshop stuff.

02:17.858 --> 02:20.093
16 clear!

02:27.134 --> 02:29.102
Pratt. Good school.

02:29.136 --> 02:31.004
I got to think there's
a better way to make tuition.

02:31.038 --> 02:33.006
It's not tuition. I dropped out.

02:33.040 --> 02:34.607
What, this glamorous
life of crime is worth

02:34.642 --> 02:35.742
throwing all that away for?

02:35.776 --> 02:36.862
No.

02:37.445 --> 02:39.145
But she is.

02:43.884 --> 02:44.951
It's hard to give her the world

02:44.985 --> 02:46.719
doing late shifts at a student center.

02:46.754 --> 02:48.788
Harlee, you good?

02:53.994 --> 02:55.925
All clear.

02:56.964 --> 02:59.032
I'm gonna be checking up on you,

02:59.066 --> 03:00.867
Debbie Ramirez.

03:00.901 --> 03:02.135
I want you back in school.

03:02.169 --> 03:03.570
I mean it.

03:03.604 --> 03:06.072
And listen to me very carefully.

03:06.106 --> 03:08.133
Your baby doesn't need the world.

03:09.076 --> 03:11.077
She needs a mother she can look up to.

03:13.747 --> 03:15.048
This is your second chance.

03:15.082 --> 03:16.783
Don't blow it.

03:19.620 --> 03:22.121
Harlee, you're gonna want to see this.

03:26.927 --> 03:28.962
So much for the benefits
of an honest day's work.

03:28.996 --> 03:30.630
I mean, there's got to be 100K here.

03:30.664 --> 03:32.565
Bag and tag. I'm gonna go get Loman.

03:32.600 --> 03:34.067
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Hang on.

03:34.101 --> 03:36.803
You know the heist going south
cost us a big pay day.

03:36.837 --> 03:38.471
- No.
- We took risks, all of us.

03:38.506 --> 03:39.339
And we got nothing to show for it

03:39.373 --> 03:40.807
except bullet holes and a lot of heat.

03:40.841 --> 03:42.108
This is not happening.

03:42.142 --> 03:43.676
I was gonna open a bar with my friends.

03:43.711 --> 03:45.912
- A family place. Tufo?
- Pay off my mom's mortgage.

03:45.946 --> 03:46.946
I know you have plans too.

03:46.981 --> 03:50.083
So we need to decide right now.
The three of us.

03:50.117 --> 03:52.151
Are we in or are we out?

03:52.186 --> 03:53.753
In.

03:59.793 --> 04:01.861
I said bag it and tag it.

04:01.896 --> 04:03.820
This is evidence.

04:09.590 --> 04:11.137
- Hey.
- Hey.

04:12.172 --> 04:13.506
I hope you left a hell of a tip

04:13.541 --> 04:15.008
for that bartender last night.

04:15.042 --> 04:16.809
Nobody pressed charges.

04:16.844 --> 04:18.211
Yeah, well,

04:18.245 --> 04:19.946
the day is still young.

04:21.582 --> 04:24.784
So, is this an official visit,

04:24.818 --> 04:27.760
or are you just mad
that maybe I cost you a vote?

04:27.794 --> 04:30.023
It's official.

04:30.057 --> 04:31.991
I'm here to talk to Captain McManus

04:32.026 --> 04:34.060
about policy changes.

04:34.094 --> 04:35.808
You're full of it.

04:36.830 --> 04:38.531
I'm checking up on an old friend.

04:38.566 --> 04:40.066
- I'm fine.
- I know you better

04:40.100 --> 04:42.201
than to accept your first answer.

04:44.838 --> 04:46.539
My back hurts.

04:46.574 --> 04:47.640
Linda left me.

04:47.675 --> 04:49.142
The Mets are playing like the Mets.

04:49.176 --> 04:50.643
Linda left you?

04:50.678 --> 04:52.528
Oh, you don't care about my back?

04:53.847 --> 04:56.080
Yeah, she found out.

04:56.584 --> 04:57.650
About what?

04:57.685 --> 04:59.118
Donnie.

05:01.188 --> 05:02.221
Did you tell her that...

05:02.256 --> 05:05.525
No, no, no, no, I didn't want
to twist the knife.

05:09.630 --> 05:11.521
Something else is going on, Woz.

05:12.199 --> 05:14.267
I know you. You can tell me.

05:19.273 --> 05:21.708
This place is falling apart.

05:28.882 --> 05:31.050
Seven, four, six, eight,

05:31.085 --> 05:32.852
nine, two, B.

05:32.886 --> 05:34.187
Two, B?

05:34.221 --> 05:36.055
Yeah. Or not to be.

05:36.090 --> 05:38.691
It says I'm missing a digit.

05:38.726 --> 05:41.194
Killers, thugs, and pervs
on every corner,

05:41.228 --> 05:42.895
and you got us doing data entry.

05:42.930 --> 05:45.031
You want to jump into
these Bulgarian passports?

05:45.065 --> 05:47.100
They got to have about ten extra
letters in their alphabet.

05:47.134 --> 05:48.001
It's four, actually,

05:48.035 --> 05:50.036
but the Cyrillic makes it seem
like more.

05:50.070 --> 05:51.904
Somebody leave your cage door open?

05:51.939 --> 05:54.540
Ahh, the garbage unit...

05:54.575 --> 05:57.276
actually entering cash into the system.

05:57.311 --> 05:59.278
Have the laws of gravity
been suspended too?

05:59.313 --> 06:01.881
Nah, but they should
pass a law against that tie.

06:03.784 --> 06:06.119
I see your defense mechanisms
are still intact.

06:06.153 --> 06:07.654
You know, if I didn't know
better, I'd think you guys were

06:07.688 --> 06:08.788
worried somebody's watching.

06:08.822 --> 06:11.090
- Unless somebody wants
- to grab a keyboard and pitch in,

06:11.125 --> 06:13.559
he should watch from his office.

06:13.594 --> 06:16.229
Don't worry. I will.

06:17.665 --> 06:19.666
Whoa, I didn't even click on anything.

06:19.700 --> 06:20.967
What did I tell you about that, man?

06:21.001 --> 06:22.769
No triple X on the work station.

06:22.803 --> 06:24.904
No... that's a DEA alert.

06:24.938 --> 06:27.640
It says we're in possession
of DEA-marked currency.

06:27.675 --> 06:30.243
Case number one, five, Charlie,
eight, seven, seven.

06:30.277 --> 06:32.245
This means more paperwork.

06:34.381 --> 06:36.182
One, five, Charlie, what?

06:36.216 --> 06:37.750
Eight, seven, seven.

06:40.954 --> 06:42.121
That face means more paperwork.

06:42.156 --> 06:43.756
No, this face is much worse.

06:47.294 --> 06:49.662
What is it? Who stole the money?

06:52.199 --> 06:54.167
We did.

07:01.320 --> 07:03.353
$500 matched the heist money.

07:03.388 --> 07:05.088
Got to be Donnie Pomp.

07:05.123 --> 07:06.790
I'm not so sure. If he skipped town,

07:06.824 --> 07:07.958
the money would've, too.

07:07.992 --> 07:09.092
Currency circulates.

07:09.127 --> 07:12.696
That $12 million could be
all over the northeast by now.

07:12.730 --> 07:13.964
And if you're looking for a new life,

07:13.998 --> 07:15.198
isn't a new ID first priority?

07:15.233 --> 07:16.867
But that's the thing.

07:16.901 --> 07:19.269
All the photo IDs are backed up
on the computers we seized.

07:19.304 --> 07:20.771
There's no Donnie Pomp.

07:20.805 --> 07:21.972
He's Internal Affairs.

07:22.006 --> 07:23.307
He's not gonna leave a paper trail.

07:23.341 --> 07:25.208
Speaking of the rat pack.

07:25.243 --> 07:28.178
Hey, Espada, go head off
that weasel face

07:28.212 --> 07:30.314
and keep him away from the DEA.

07:30.348 --> 07:32.449
Yeah, I'll go tell him I confess...

07:32.483 --> 07:34.985
to the unfortunate situation
in stall number three.

07:37.221 --> 07:39.656
I should've just
let those guys have the cash.

07:39.691 --> 07:42.292
You know, the money
I gave you from the heist was

07:42.327 --> 07:44.361
for Cristina's college fund.

07:44.395 --> 07:47.130
There were other
pressing matters at the time.

07:47.165 --> 07:48.732
Like keeping Miguel out of her life.

07:50.368 --> 07:53.804
All right, so if Miguel
left town with the cash,

07:53.838 --> 07:55.872
who the hell's spending it?

08:00.445 --> 08:01.906
Caddie.

08:03.381 --> 08:05.315
He's the only other person
who had access.

08:05.350 --> 08:07.217
You trusted that junkie?

08:07.251 --> 08:08.852
I'll tell him to lay low for a while.

08:08.886 --> 08:10.487
Junkies don't know how to lay low.

08:10.521 --> 08:11.822
I'll talk to him.

08:11.856 --> 08:13.490
Believe me, I'll get my point across.

08:13.524 --> 08:14.992
No, you don't know him like I do.

08:15.026 --> 08:17.694
- Exactly, no soft spot.
- I'll deal with it.

08:17.729 --> 08:20.697
Fine, I'm tired of dealing
with your messes anyhow.

08:20.732 --> 08:22.265
And what about yours?

08:22.300 --> 08:23.834
You think Stahl's gonna lay off

08:23.868 --> 08:25.836
just because you spilled
a little whiskey?

08:25.870 --> 08:28.105
He'll find another angle.

08:34.412 --> 08:36.380
What do these emojis mean?

08:36.414 --> 08:37.780
WTF.

08:37.815 --> 08:39.850
Six symbols to represent three letters?

08:39.884 --> 08:42.753
The point is, I'm asking him
to explain where he's been,

08:42.787 --> 08:43.953
and he won't, or can't.

08:43.988 --> 08:46.023
Okay, well, "WTF" notwithstanding,

08:46.057 --> 08:46.923
this is great news.

08:46.958 --> 08:48.792
Congratulations. You found your father.

08:48.826 --> 08:50.961
I haven't found him
if he won't tell me where he is.

08:50.995 --> 08:52.729
He might not understand
these hieroglyphics.

08:52.764 --> 08:54.531
Could you just tell me
where he sent it from?

08:54.565 --> 08:56.366
- The text?
- No.

08:56.401 --> 08:57.901
Aren't you a private investigator?

08:57.935 --> 09:00.237
An above-average one,
but I can't retroactively

09:00.271 --> 09:01.538
trace a text message.

09:05.009 --> 09:08.245
However, I was able to scan
those old photos of your father

09:08.279 --> 09:09.246
that your grandmother loaned me.

09:09.280 --> 09:11.214
I thought you might like them.

09:11.249 --> 09:12.467
Thanks.

09:13.050 --> 09:14.084
I'll get this back to you.

09:14.118 --> 09:16.353
Keep it. Law firm has tons of them.

09:17.784 --> 09:18.951
Hey, cheer up.

09:18.980 --> 09:20.380
This is a significant development.

09:20.414 --> 09:23.083
He tells you he'll reach out.

09:23.117 --> 09:25.118
Yeah. Eventually.

09:27.000 --> 09:33.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

09:39.539 --> 09:40.678
Caddie?

09:47.375 --> 09:49.142
Either one of you seen Caddie?

09:49.176 --> 09:51.745
You Mother Teresa or something?

09:51.779 --> 09:54.080
Just a friend.

09:58.019 --> 10:00.754
Haven't seen him in a while.

10:00.788 --> 10:02.756
Pity. He was a fun dude.

10:06.460 --> 10:09.029
You probably hocked
this phone I gave you, Caddie,

10:09.063 --> 10:11.097
but I need you to call me.

10:11.132 --> 10:13.099
The gift I handed you
isn't safe anymore.

10:13.134 --> 10:14.367
Find me.

10:17.171 --> 10:19.973
Yeah?

10:26.455 --> 10:28.214
- What's up?
- CSU found a casing.

10:28.249 --> 10:29.683
.40 caliber.

10:29.717 --> 10:31.851
Wow, that's a lot of bullet
for a mugging.

10:31.886 --> 10:33.353
Yeah, I'd say "execution."

10:35.423 --> 10:37.123
I'm gonna go check in with ME.

10:37.158 --> 10:40.994
Oh, no, no, no, no, this is
your crime scene, detective.

10:41.028 --> 10:42.996
Who's our vic?

10:43.030 --> 10:45.832
A young woman took
a single GSW to the head

10:45.866 --> 10:48.134
sometime between 5:00 and 7:00 a.m.

10:48.169 --> 10:49.669
Any eyes on it?

10:49.704 --> 10:52.339
Nope, appears to have been
a pre-dawn party of two.

10:52.373 --> 10:54.174
An anonymous tip rolled over
from your desk

10:54.208 --> 10:56.176
after you took off.

10:56.210 --> 10:58.845
Why would a tipster be calling
directly into our unit?

10:58.879 --> 11:01.014
That's the mystery of the day.

11:01.048 --> 11:03.216
CSU found a .40-cal casing.

11:03.250 --> 11:05.885
We might be able to
get some prints off it.

11:05.920 --> 11:07.187
Do you have a bullet?

11:07.221 --> 11:09.189
Yeah. In her skull.

11:09.223 --> 11:12.359
Excuse me.
I'm gonna go make myself useful.

11:14.228 --> 11:16.096
Is there something going on
between the two of you

11:16.130 --> 11:17.864
that I need to care about?

11:17.898 --> 11:20.233
No cameras, no witnesses.
Got to work pretty hard

11:20.267 --> 11:21.701
to find that kind of privacy.

11:21.736 --> 11:23.269
Kind of thing that would require a plan.

11:23.304 --> 11:27.040
Well, probably someone
familiar with her routine.

11:27.074 --> 11:30.443
Followed her, waited for
the right opportunity.

11:30.478 --> 11:32.078
Shooter goes through that much trouble,

11:32.113 --> 11:33.320
kills her with a single shot,

11:33.354 --> 11:35.048
and then leaves a shell casing behind?

11:35.082 --> 11:38.018
Opened like a pro,
closed like an amateur.

11:40.421 --> 11:42.122
It's Caroline.

11:42.156 --> 11:43.456
Huh?

11:43.491 --> 11:45.091
I know her. I...

11:45.126 --> 11:48.194
She was Nava's ex-fiancée.

11:48.229 --> 11:49.529
What?

11:49.563 --> 11:52.032
James Nava, our ADA. Tall, beard.

11:52.066 --> 11:53.266
The crusader guy?

11:53.300 --> 11:55.152
He was prosecuting the mob case

11:55.187 --> 11:56.518
before it got thrown out. Do you think?

11:56.553 --> 11:59.539
No. No, no, no. Some low-level DA?

11:59.573 --> 12:01.741
He's not even gonna crack the top ten

12:01.776 --> 12:04.144
of Bianchi's enemy list.

12:04.178 --> 12:06.312
Mm-mm.

12:06.347 --> 12:08.430
The anonymous tip.

12:09.450 --> 12:11.818
And she was killed with a .40 caliber?

12:11.852 --> 12:13.820
Says the casing.

12:23.097 --> 12:25.265
What was the wine we spilled
when we arrested Bianchi?

12:25.299 --> 12:29.102
- Some expensive red.
- He has my gun.

12:29.136 --> 12:30.303
My backup piece.

12:30.337 --> 12:31.938
.40 caliber.

12:33.340 --> 12:36.242
It's my name on Bianchi's list,

12:36.277 --> 12:39.045
and he signed it
all over this crime scene.

12:42.280 --> 12:43.980
All right, guys.
Let's get her out of here.

12:44.014 --> 12:45.615
They should zip me up with her,

12:45.649 --> 12:47.450
save themselves a bag.

12:47.484 --> 12:49.686
We can try a new approach

12:49.720 --> 12:51.454
and tell the truth.

12:51.488 --> 12:53.523
Report your gun stolen.

12:53.557 --> 12:55.291
Six hours after the body dropped?

12:55.326 --> 12:57.594
You didn't know until now.

12:57.628 --> 13:00.263
It's not as if you had motive.

13:03.534 --> 13:05.602
Do you have motive?

13:06.904 --> 13:09.339
I'm dating Nava.

13:09.373 --> 13:10.974
How come I didn't know about this?

13:11.008 --> 13:14.277
Nobody knows.
I was trying to be discrete.

13:15.412 --> 13:16.879
Once those ballistics come back...

13:16.914 --> 13:19.349
No, the bullet's not your only problem.

13:19.383 --> 13:21.017
Unless somebody else loaded your gun,

13:21.051 --> 13:24.287
your fingerprints are
all over the casings.

13:24.321 --> 13:27.824
The good thing is,
it's our tip, our case.

13:27.858 --> 13:29.525
Finding it a little hard

13:29.560 --> 13:30.893
to see the silver lining in that one.

13:30.928 --> 13:33.496
Look. Tess is running point.

13:33.530 --> 13:35.632
We have to get back to the precinct,

13:35.666 --> 13:37.091
catch everybody up to speed.

13:37.126 --> 13:39.909
No, Woz, wait, slow down.
This has to stay between us.

13:39.943 --> 13:41.904
If we're gonna beat Bianchi at his game,

13:41.939 --> 13:45.241
we're gonna need every player
on the field.

13:45.275 --> 13:47.744
I think we may have a leak.

13:47.778 --> 13:49.245
Verco found the freezer.

13:49.279 --> 13:50.580
He was waiting for me there.

13:50.614 --> 13:52.382
I think he's squeezing one of the crew.

13:52.416 --> 13:54.651
How many things
have you been keeping from me?

13:54.685 --> 13:56.519
I was looking for something firm.

13:56.553 --> 13:57.920
Hey, we got a name.

13:57.955 --> 14:00.423
Caroline Winston, JSD.

14:00.457 --> 14:02.859
Her prints are in the system
through the Bar Association.

14:02.893 --> 14:04.861
- She's a lawyer.
- Do we have a next of kin yet?

14:04.895 --> 14:07.597
Espada's headed to her
apartment to look for her phone.

14:07.631 --> 14:08.957
She's about a block from here.

14:08.992 --> 14:10.600
She was probably headed to the subway.

14:10.634 --> 14:12.905
- Early morning.
- Or late night.

14:12.939 --> 14:14.837
Team's all set. We good to take her?

14:14.872 --> 14:16.673
Yeah, go ahead.
I want the ballistics report

14:16.707 --> 14:17.840
as soon as possible.

14:17.875 --> 14:19.609
Sooner if you want to impress me.

14:19.643 --> 14:21.577
I have harnessed the power
of the Internet

14:21.612 --> 14:22.987
for good instead of evil.

14:23.022 --> 14:24.947
- You Google something?
- I found something:

14:24.982 --> 14:26.716
an engagement announcement
in the "New Haven Register"

14:26.750 --> 14:27.784
from last spring,

14:27.818 --> 14:29.952
during our victim's happier times.

14:29.987 --> 14:32.388
The victim was engaged to James Nava.

14:32.423 --> 14:33.756
Is that our ADA?

14:41.398 --> 14:43.012
Cha!

14:43.634 --> 14:44.634
What's this?

14:44.668 --> 14:47.370
Have you ever read
about King Umberto I of Italy?

14:47.404 --> 14:48.971
Yeah, since I'm clearly Italian.

14:49.006 --> 14:52.542
1900, King Umberto happens
upon a small tavern

14:52.576 --> 14:54.811
whose owner looks so much like himself,

14:54.845 --> 14:56.579
he could be his twin.

14:56.613 --> 14:58.081
Ooh, great story. Tell it again.

14:58.116 --> 15:00.483
They have a few laughs
about it, a few drinks.

15:00.517 --> 15:01.984
Then they get to talking.

15:02.019 --> 15:04.487
Turns out, the pair were born
on the same day

15:04.521 --> 15:07.551
in the same year in the same town,

15:07.585 --> 15:10.393
and the owner's name
just also happens to be...

15:10.427 --> 15:11.427
I think I can guess.

15:11.462 --> 15:12.395
Umberto!

15:12.605 --> 15:15.807
So, the very next morning,
the king is informed

15:15.842 --> 15:17.676
that the tavern owner was hit
in the neck

15:17.710 --> 15:19.845
by an accidental gun discharge.

15:19.879 --> 15:21.079
Oh, should've kept his safety on.

15:21.114 --> 15:25.684
Yeah, yeah, so the king asks
when the man's funeral will be,

15:25.718 --> 15:27.653
but before the aide
has a chance to respond,

15:27.687 --> 15:29.821
King Umberto is shot in the throat

15:29.856 --> 15:32.758
by an assassin in the crowd,
dies instantly.

15:32.792 --> 15:33.892
True story.

15:33.927 --> 15:36.528
So, the point behind your
charming little narrative

15:36.562 --> 15:37.863
is what?

15:37.897 --> 15:39.298
Coincidence?

15:39.332 --> 15:40.465
Hey!

15:40.500 --> 15:43.702
The DEA money that was stolen
in the armored truck heist...

15:43.736 --> 15:45.037
that you reported...

15:45.071 --> 15:46.972
just showed up at the scene of a bust

15:47.006 --> 15:49.272
that you participated in.

15:50.143 --> 15:52.096
What are the chances?

15:53.046 --> 15:55.347
I think I'll leave my safety on today.

15:55.381 --> 15:57.783
Be a fall guy if you want, Loman,

15:57.817 --> 15:59.851
but don't make it so damn easy.

16:15.768 --> 16:17.736
Come on, give it up.

16:17.770 --> 16:20.038
Whoa, whoa. Easy.

16:20.073 --> 16:21.073
It responds to kindness.

16:21.107 --> 16:23.241
It responds to nothing.

16:23.276 --> 16:26.745
Hey, listen. Did you log in that cash

16:26.779 --> 16:28.213
from the forgery mill?

16:28.247 --> 16:30.248
Yeah. Thanks for your help.

16:30.283 --> 16:32.718
You missed the DEA rectal examination.

16:32.752 --> 16:33.986
Hey, give me another dollar, would you?

16:34.020 --> 16:35.754
Verco seems to think it's the same cash

16:35.788 --> 16:37.680
from the armored truck heist.

16:38.791 --> 16:40.692
Apparently Donnie Pomp is out there

16:40.727 --> 16:43.261
spending our hard-earned stolen cash.

16:43.296 --> 16:45.364
- We don't know it's Donnie.
- Who else would it be?

16:53.806 --> 16:55.340
Did anyone from the crew know him well?

16:55.375 --> 16:56.942
Donnie Pomp?

16:56.976 --> 16:59.611
Internal Affairs? Are you kidding?

17:05.885 --> 17:07.219
No need to volunteer information.

17:07.252 --> 17:09.287
Answer yes or no when possible.
Don't elaborate.

17:09.321 --> 17:10.321
But his questions are implying that I...

17:10.356 --> 17:13.273
I know what his questions
are implying, but...

17:13.925 --> 17:16.454
what a defense attorney says
isn't testimony.

17:17.163 --> 17:18.542
Detectives?

17:19.098 --> 17:20.799
Your office told us you were in court.

17:20.833 --> 17:22.067
Short recess.

17:22.101 --> 17:23.734
Do you have a minute, Counselor?

17:23.770 --> 17:26.371
- Not the best time.
- It's important.

17:32.445 --> 17:34.079
Seriously, if I wanted to be this bored,

17:34.113 --> 17:35.714
I could go to Grandma's.

17:35.748 --> 17:37.049
I'm almost done.

17:38.184 --> 17:40.819
Hey, since when does Toby have
a motorcycle?

17:40.853 --> 17:43.822
It's old. He just finished fixing it up.

17:43.856 --> 17:45.891
We raced his brother
down Flatbush last night,

17:45.925 --> 17:49.161
took a turn so low I could've
touched the pavement.

17:49.195 --> 17:50.829
<i>Sounds safe.</i>

17:50.863 --> 17:55.067
<i>Eh, maybe not,
but it made me feel alive.</i>

17:55.101 --> 17:58.003
You know those moments
when it's like time stops

17:58.037 --> 18:00.439
<i>and nothing matters
except the here and now?</i>

18:00.473 --> 18:02.140
<i>Yeah, no, with my mom always on my back,</i>

18:02.175 --> 18:05.744
I never really get a chance
to ignore the consequences.

18:05.778 --> 18:07.846
<i>Well, we can fix that today,</i>

18:07.880 --> 18:09.611
<i>if you're interested.</i>

18:14.954 --> 18:16.955
Where? Where did you find her?

18:16.989 --> 18:19.666
West Prospect Park, near 7th Avenue.

18:20.726 --> 18:23.795
I told her a hundred times
not to cut through there.

18:23.830 --> 18:25.831
- I'm so sorry.
- When did you break off

18:25.865 --> 18:27.265
the engagement?

18:29.235 --> 18:30.469
Um, couple of months ago.

18:30.503 --> 18:32.204
Did you say shot in the head?

18:32.238 --> 18:33.805
Yes.

18:33.840 --> 18:35.841
- One bullet?
- Does it make a difference?

18:35.875 --> 18:37.275
I'm asking if it was suicide.

18:37.310 --> 18:38.844
No, it was a murder.

18:38.878 --> 18:41.046
One bullet to the head, execution style.

18:41.080 --> 18:42.881
- Tess.
- Who would do that?

18:42.915 --> 18:44.883
Random psychopaths aren't roaming around

18:44.917 --> 18:47.266
executing women in the park
at 7:00 in the morning.

18:49.088 --> 18:51.123
Did Caroline have any enemies?

18:54.193 --> 18:56.228
Is this a police interview?

18:56.262 --> 18:58.130
When was the last time you saw her?

18:58.164 --> 18:59.498
Last night.

18:59.532 --> 19:00.732
She came to my apartment.

19:00.766 --> 19:02.000
Doesn't sound like a clean break.

19:02.034 --> 19:02.934
We were together a long time.

19:02.969 --> 19:04.659
She wanted to believe it was temporary.

19:04.693 --> 19:06.371
Did you guys fight about that?

19:06.405 --> 19:08.306
I mean, you mentioned
that she could've been suicidal.

19:08.341 --> 19:09.908
It wasn't a fight.

19:09.942 --> 19:12.043
She saw two teacups
on the table, she got upset.

19:12.078 --> 19:14.146
Who did the other teacup belong to?

19:17.116 --> 19:18.850
No one.

19:18.885 --> 19:20.519
I set my cup down somewhere,
grabbed another.

19:20.553 --> 19:22.521
Where is she now?

19:22.555 --> 19:24.890
Most likely on her way to the morgue.

19:24.924 --> 19:26.858
What time did she leave there?

19:26.893 --> 19:27.926
Your apartment.

19:27.960 --> 19:29.528
James, we're back.

19:29.562 --> 19:32.301
- Start without me.
- It's your witness.

19:32.865 --> 19:35.834
- Excuse me.
- I have to request a continuance.

19:35.868 --> 19:38.436
Well, do you mind stopping by
the precinct after that?

19:38.471 --> 19:41.439
Help us with some details, timeline?

19:42.808 --> 19:46.111
Yeah. Okay.

19:48.147 --> 19:49.281
Well, I hate to say it,

19:49.315 --> 19:51.983
but I think that's our guy.

19:56.622 --> 19:58.857
Bianchi. Tell me where he is.

19:58.891 --> 20:00.125
Ma'am, please lower your voice.

20:00.159 --> 20:01.193
This is a tranquil space.

20:01.227 --> 20:02.594
It's a front for the mob.

20:02.628 --> 20:04.462
I'm sorry, but you need to leave.

20:04.497 --> 20:06.198
Not till he gets his ass out here.

20:06.232 --> 20:08.033
I'm calling the police.

20:08.067 --> 20:10.435
Good news. They're already here.

20:11.837 --> 20:12.904
Bianchi.

20:12.939 --> 20:15.574
Detective Santos.

20:15.608 --> 20:18.276
I'm afraid this establishment is

20:18.311 --> 20:20.145
a little above your price point.

20:20.179 --> 20:22.080
You want to come after me? Let's go.

20:22.114 --> 20:24.049
At least I can defend myself.

20:24.083 --> 20:25.317
Well, you do seem to be carrying

20:25.351 --> 20:26.318
a little extra tension today.

20:26.352 --> 20:30.055
How about a deep tissue massage?
On the house.

20:30.089 --> 20:31.156
Tell him to get his hands off me.

20:31.190 --> 20:32.324
Or what? You'll...

20:33.626 --> 20:36.895
Okay, okay. Stop.

20:38.931 --> 20:41.466
Now you're just making a scene.

20:41.500 --> 20:44.374
It's got nothing on the one
you made this morning.

20:45.338 --> 20:47.909
How's it feel, Detective,

20:48.474 --> 20:51.397
to have your face stamped on a charge?

20:52.478 --> 20:56.147
That woman had nothing to do
with you and me.

20:56.182 --> 20:59.184
But that's the problem
with the dirty end of the field.

20:59.218 --> 21:00.704
Isn't it?

21:01.554 --> 21:03.502
A lot of collateral damage.

21:04.056 --> 21:06.625
Now, that clip of yours holds what?

21:06.659 --> 21:10.028
Nine, minus the one.

21:10.062 --> 21:11.801
That leaves...

21:12.651 --> 21:15.000
that leaves a lot more bullets.

21:44.161 --> 21:45.435
Well...

21:45.628 --> 21:47.505
House is still standing.

21:47.565 --> 21:48.765
That was a coin flip.

21:49.621 --> 21:51.255
Hey.

21:53.612 --> 21:55.079
You back?

21:55.113 --> 21:57.114
Suitcase needs restocking.

21:57.149 --> 22:00.851
Well, why don't you lose the suitcase?

22:00.886 --> 22:02.887
The house may still be standing, Matt,

22:02.921 --> 22:07.042
but some things are beyond repair.

22:08.593 --> 22:10.194
Like my office window.

22:10.228 --> 22:14.532
Today it just... shattered.

22:17.469 --> 22:22.073
I-I was always good at that
"no questions asked" part.

22:22.107 --> 22:24.075
Too good, as it turns out.

22:24.109 --> 22:27.178
So, should I ignore the gun
in your hand?

22:28.146 --> 22:30.114
I need to protect somebody.

22:30.148 --> 22:31.182
You always do.

22:31.216 --> 22:34.685
Yeah, except this time,
I don't know if I should.

22:36.822 --> 22:39.098
Just fix your window, Matt.

22:39.791 --> 22:41.618
It's a good place to start.

22:50.168 --> 22:52.103
Most hard evidence in a case is gathered

22:52.137 --> 22:52.903
in the first 24 hours.

22:52.938 --> 22:54.438
Why don't you try gathering some?

22:54.473 --> 22:56.107
I can walk and chew gum, James.

22:56.141 --> 22:58.008
I know what this is,
and you can always find me.

22:58.043 --> 22:59.910
Please, go do your job.

22:59.945 --> 23:00.911
I thought we said 2:00.

23:00.946 --> 23:02.747
Do me a favor.
No more questions for a while.

23:02.781 --> 23:03.547
Is there an issue?

23:03.582 --> 23:04.515
I said all I'm gonna say today.

23:04.549 --> 23:06.183
If you have anything else
you want to share,

23:06.218 --> 23:07.885
you know where to find us.

23:08.987 --> 23:10.555
He's lawyering up.

23:11.022 --> 23:12.123
Well, he's an ADA.

23:12.157 --> 23:13.124
You come at him with klieg lights,

23:13.158 --> 23:13.991
what do you expect?

23:14.025 --> 23:15.960
I have enough experience with lying men

23:15.994 --> 23:17.995
to know when one's hiding something.

23:18.029 --> 23:20.464
I'm sure he's seen his share
of false arrests.

23:20.499 --> 23:22.046
You know, it's a reflex action.

23:22.081 --> 23:23.768
Crimes of passion are always sloppy.

23:23.802 --> 23:24.999
I don't care who you are.

23:25.971 --> 23:28.139
Are you familiar with the term
"rush to judgment"?

23:28.173 --> 23:30.641
Can we go back to this morning
when you and I weren't speaking?

23:30.675 --> 23:32.143
I just want to make sure
you don't miss anything.

23:32.177 --> 23:34.845
It's not my first barbecue, Harlee.

23:34.880 --> 23:37.181
The search warrant is
being issued as we speak

23:37.215 --> 23:39.150
for the security footage.

23:39.184 --> 23:40.217
Which security footage?

23:40.252 --> 23:42.219
Nava's apartment building.

23:42.254 --> 23:44.822
Got to build a timeline,
verify when the victim entered

23:44.856 --> 23:47.057
and exited his building last night.

23:47.092 --> 23:48.192
Promise you won't kill the messenger?

23:48.226 --> 23:51.061
- No.
- Like, a general assurance?

23:51.096 --> 23:53.230
At this rate, I might kill you
before you give me the message.

23:53.265 --> 23:55.538
Crime lab misplaced your shell casings.

23:57.035 --> 23:59.036
- Define misplaced.
- No damn clue where it is.

23:59.070 --> 24:00.871
Did they at least dust it first?

24:00.906 --> 24:03.174
Logged on scene, not in the kit.

24:03.208 --> 24:04.809
- Who's the crime tech?
- Tuscano.

24:04.843 --> 24:07.077
If you want to berate directly,
he's on hold at my desk.

24:07.112 --> 24:09.680
- Unbelievable. What line?
- Three.

24:09.714 --> 24:12.283
I'll check and see if they
broke down the perimeter.

24:19.057 --> 24:21.091
Hey, this is Tess Nazario at the 64th.

24:21.126 --> 24:23.027
I was waiting on a residential
search warrant.

24:23.061 --> 24:24.895
Tuscano, you can map
the genome off a saliva swab,

24:24.930 --> 24:27.331
but you can't hold on
to one metal object?

24:27.365 --> 24:29.099
Can you hold onto it for me
for a minute?

24:29.134 --> 24:30.910
We might expand it
to the adjacent apartment.

24:30.944 --> 24:31.837
Yeah, thanks.

24:31.871 --> 24:34.205
- Nope, we'll re-file.
- Cleaner paperwork.

24:34.239 --> 24:35.773
Thank you.

24:35.807 --> 24:38.209
It's like incompetence is
contagious or something.

24:38.243 --> 24:39.310
Who was that?

24:39.344 --> 24:43.214
Oh, drunk and disorderly
at the 3rd Street cleaners.

24:43.248 --> 24:44.715
I'll take it.

24:44.749 --> 24:46.717
And I wouldn't worry about that shell.

24:46.751 --> 24:48.241
You've still got ballistics.

24:59.886 --> 25:01.820
That guy's not winning
any arm wrestling matches

25:01.855 --> 25:02.988
anytime soon.

25:03.023 --> 25:04.579
Oh, he was wearing a vest.

25:05.892 --> 25:07.026
What about that one?

25:07.060 --> 25:08.927
Got tired of his mouthing off.

25:11.031 --> 25:11.917
Yeah, listen.

25:11.951 --> 25:13.832
The cash from the heist showed up

25:13.867 --> 25:15.704
at the forgery mill.

25:16.770 --> 25:19.171
We got a lot of cases to clear,

25:19.205 --> 25:21.373
so if you're gonna ask a question,

25:21.408 --> 25:22.574
don't take the scenic route.

25:22.609 --> 25:24.176
You told Espada that Donnie's the one

25:24.210 --> 25:25.878
who put it back into circulation.

25:25.912 --> 25:27.079
I told him he might have.

25:27.113 --> 25:29.114
You and I both know that's impossible.

25:29.149 --> 25:31.083
Would you rather me tell him
Donnie couldn't do it

25:31.117 --> 25:32.551
because you killed him?

25:34.954 --> 25:36.068
It never stops, does it?

25:36.102 --> 25:39.591
Every lie I tell is for the family.

25:39.626 --> 25:41.093
We're gonna get through this,

25:41.127 --> 25:43.529
but you're gonna have to take my lead.

25:44.764 --> 25:46.532
Now, are you with me, Loman?

25:48.501 --> 25:50.736
To the end of the line, Lieutenant.

25:50.770 --> 25:52.104
All right.

25:52.138 --> 25:54.230
Let's get back to work.

25:55.108 --> 25:58.477
Hey. That's not your service weapon.

25:58.511 --> 25:59.912
This, well,

25:59.946 --> 26:02.614
you got to be able to shoot
whatever you can find.

26:02.649 --> 26:04.083
They use this a lot on the street.

26:04.117 --> 26:05.117
Easy to hide.

26:05.151 --> 26:06.636
Nine millimeter?

26:07.587 --> 26:09.621
Nah, it's a 40-cal.

26:10.924 --> 26:12.091
Nice.

26:51.231 --> 26:52.698
Yo, what's the holdup?

26:52.732 --> 26:54.533
I don't know.
The clerk was sitting on it.

26:54.567 --> 26:56.635
He said he thought you wanted
to expand the search warrant.

26:56.669 --> 26:57.503
No.

26:57.537 --> 26:58.804
Why is it everybody wants to do my job,

26:58.838 --> 26:59.938
but all they do is get in my way?

26:59.973 --> 27:01.039
I'll drive if you want.

27:01.074 --> 27:03.175
Hey, I got it, Detective Espada.

27:03.209 --> 27:04.610
Why don't you sit this one out?

27:04.644 --> 27:06.178
Last time I checked, you're not my CO.

27:06.212 --> 27:09.281
Gonna make me pull rank?
I'm getting cabin fever in here.

27:09.315 --> 27:11.216
I could use a field trip.

27:11.251 --> 27:12.951
Like I said.

27:12.986 --> 27:15.621
Don't worry. I won't get out of the car.

27:53.193 --> 27:55.160
<i>Beautiful throw by Garcia.</i>

28:00.567 --> 28:03.035
What are you doing? Don't swing at 3-0!

28:03.069 --> 28:06.572
<i>Here's the pitch. Swing and a miss.</i>

28:07.740 --> 28:09.041
<i>Throws back to the pitcher.</i>

28:10.910 --> 28:12.978
Come on, not in the ninth.

29:20.647 --> 29:22.114
Can I help you with something?

29:22.148 --> 29:24.416
It's okay. NYPD.

29:24.450 --> 29:26.084
This is evidence
in a murder investigation.

29:26.119 --> 29:27.986
A badge isn't a warrant.

29:29.122 --> 29:31.657
Got it right here. Sorry.

29:31.691 --> 29:34.359
My partner got ahead of herself.

29:52.081 --> 29:53.815
Jesus, Harlee, why don't you
just throw me down the stairs,

29:53.849 --> 29:54.916
save us both the trouble?

29:54.950 --> 29:56.718
I might... what are you doing
bringing Verco here?

29:56.752 --> 29:58.687
I can't seem to shake either of you.

29:58.721 --> 30:00.255
I have been scratching my head
as to why I can't

30:00.289 --> 30:02.490
- get any traction on this case.
- Lower your voice.

30:02.525 --> 30:03.925
And the reason is standing
right in front of me.

30:03.959 --> 30:04.993
I'm sorry. Lower my voice?

30:05.027 --> 30:06.728
Surveillance footage
from this building is not

30:06.762 --> 30:08.763
gonna tell you anything
about that woman's murder.

30:08.798 --> 30:10.832
So why the rush to get your hands on it?

30:12.301 --> 30:13.902
Okay, I'll figure it out for myself.

30:13.936 --> 30:16.571
Tess, I'm on the tape.

30:16.605 --> 30:18.440
- What?
- I was here last night.

30:18.474 --> 30:19.941
I passed Caroline on my way out.

30:19.975 --> 30:21.743
Wait, wait, wait. You're the teacup?

30:21.777 --> 30:22.811
I'm the girlfriend.

30:22.845 --> 30:25.714
Ugh, even more reason for you
to stay out of this.

30:25.748 --> 30:27.449
You are never gonna
see this guy straight.

30:27.483 --> 30:29.084
It is him who doesn't see me straight.

30:29.118 --> 30:31.386
- Your judgment is clouded.
- It's not.

30:31.420 --> 30:34.659
On him, on this,
I promise you, it is not.

30:35.591 --> 30:37.058
- You care about this guy.
- More than I'd like.

30:37.093 --> 30:38.359
Enough to cover for him?

30:38.394 --> 30:40.729
He has nothing to do with this!

30:40.763 --> 30:43.431
Harlee, did you lift my shell casing?

30:43.466 --> 30:44.866
My fingerprints are on it.

30:44.900 --> 30:45.800
That's why we don't touch them.

30:45.835 --> 30:47.051
No.

30:47.903 --> 30:51.473
Caroline was killed with my gun.

30:51.507 --> 30:52.874
It was stolen.

30:52.908 --> 30:54.943
I can't tell you how.
I can't tell you why.

30:54.977 --> 30:58.330
You're just gonna have
to trust me on this.

30:58.981 --> 31:01.116
You want me to trust you?

31:01.150 --> 31:03.752
You all but accused me of
snitching to Internal Affairs,

31:03.786 --> 31:04.786
and you're asking me to submarine

31:04.820 --> 31:06.788
an entire murder investigation

31:06.822 --> 31:08.590
just 'cause you asked me to?

31:08.624 --> 31:09.724
- Yes.
- You want me to go

31:09.759 --> 31:12.994
to this woman's parents and say,
"Sorry, murder unsolved.

31:13.028 --> 31:15.286
There will be no justice
for your daughter"?

31:16.866 --> 31:18.399
Yes.

31:18.434 --> 31:19.667
And expect me to sleep tonight?

31:19.702 --> 31:22.570
Look, do it or don't do it, Tess, okay?

31:22.605 --> 31:23.838
It's your call!

31:23.873 --> 31:26.407
But I am asking for your help.

31:34.984 --> 31:36.451
There you are.

31:36.485 --> 31:38.119
Didn't realize there was
a planned detour.

31:38.154 --> 31:40.697
Just needed to look at things
with fresh eyes.

31:41.457 --> 31:42.757
Security footage?

31:42.792 --> 31:44.759
Right here.

32:00.042 --> 32:01.776
- Lieutenant Wozniak?
- Yeah.

32:01.811 --> 32:03.478
I was told you wanted to see me.

32:03.512 --> 32:05.847
Yeah, I want to see Caroline Winston.

32:07.082 --> 32:08.883
I know you wanted this one fast-tracked.

32:08.918 --> 32:11.686
I was just prepping the body
for autopsy when you came.

32:11.720 --> 32:13.555
Well, I really appreciate it.

32:13.589 --> 32:16.958
Can I have a minute alone
with her, please?

32:16.992 --> 32:19.894
I haven't... I mean,
in terms of cleaning her up.

32:19.929 --> 32:21.462
Oh, no, that's... that's okay.

32:21.497 --> 32:24.465
She's not my grandmother.
I-I can handle it.

32:41.050 --> 32:44.482
Never put much thought into this old...

32:45.921 --> 32:49.190
heart-to-heart with a corpse routine.

32:49.225 --> 32:51.483
But I'm supposed to say...

32:52.695 --> 32:55.982
I'll find the person
that did this to you.

32:57.233 --> 32:59.266
This one's gonna be...

32:59.802 --> 33:01.836
a little different.

33:06.876 --> 33:11.218
See, I know who did this to you.

33:11.881 --> 33:14.226
You didn't deserve it.

33:15.117 --> 33:17.685
But I'm not gonna solve this case.

33:20.556 --> 33:24.726
I'm sure you probably would
much rather be someplace else.

33:24.760 --> 33:26.828
That makes two of us.

33:30.799 --> 33:33.735
But I promise you this...

33:36.105 --> 33:41.175
That when I find the guy
that did this to you...

33:45.581 --> 33:47.982
I'm not gonna call the cops.

33:57.192 --> 33:59.227
Well, if you get anything else...

34:03.866 --> 34:05.833
What slug did you think
you were gonna use?

34:05.868 --> 34:07.664
I was just following
Napoleon's playbook:

34:07.698 --> 34:09.156
show up and see what happens.

34:09.190 --> 34:10.235
Amateur hour.

34:10.271 --> 34:11.438
Hey.

34:13.108 --> 34:15.292
You didn't think I'd have you covered?

34:17.458 --> 34:18.492
Thank you, Woz.

34:18.781 --> 34:21.616
If anyone's gonna make you pay
for your screw-ups,

34:21.650 --> 34:24.078
it damn well better be me.

34:24.853 --> 34:27.199
Looks like Bianchi got away
with murder today.

34:28.056 --> 34:29.524
In a way, so did I.

34:29.558 --> 34:31.259
For now.

34:31.293 --> 34:34.120
I don't break promises to dead people.

34:34.797 --> 34:36.998
I paid Bianchi a visit today.

34:37.032 --> 34:38.800
Traded threats over cucumber water.

34:38.833 --> 34:42.804
His was clear: I tell him
who put you and I onto him, or...

34:42.838 --> 34:45.706
Or he empties your clip
one bullet at a time?

34:45.741 --> 34:47.708
I can't take any more blood on my hands.

34:47.743 --> 34:51.879
It's your gun, but I gave you
the weapon to plant on Bianchi.

34:51.914 --> 34:53.848
We both have blood on our hands.

34:56.217 --> 34:58.653
Uh, I think you have
the wrong apartment.

34:58.687 --> 35:01.022
Cristina? I'm a friend of your mom's.

35:01.056 --> 35:02.431
Can I talk to her?

35:03.025 --> 35:04.999
She can't come to the door right now.

35:05.560 --> 35:07.601
Smart. She taught you well.

35:08.263 --> 35:09.998
You probably don't remember me.

35:10.032 --> 35:12.300
I think last time I saw you,
<i>you were five or six.</i>

35:12.334 --> 35:13.868
<i>I was your mom's training officer.</i>

35:13.902 --> 35:15.432
<i>My name's Caddie.</i>

35:15.467 --> 35:17.426
You don't look like a cop.

35:17.454 --> 35:18.754
I'm retired.

35:18.788 --> 35:21.128
Do you want to leave a message for her?

35:22.041 --> 35:23.792
Delivery, actually.

35:30.834 --> 35:32.935
Do me a solid and give her this.

35:35.005 --> 35:37.840
Tell her I'm laying low a while
like she asked.

35:39.576 --> 35:40.909
<i>And don't open that.</i>

35:47.946 --> 35:50.114
I never took you for a wine connoisseur.

35:50.149 --> 35:53.084
Oh, yeah. Are you kidding me?

35:54.219 --> 35:56.754
For example, this here...

35:56.789 --> 35:59.123
this is a red.

36:00.993 --> 36:03.027
Is that a do-it-yourself project?

36:03.062 --> 36:05.797
Well, with everything
that's going on around here,

36:05.831 --> 36:08.099
I need a clear view.

36:08.133 --> 36:10.868
No cracks in the window,
no cracks in the team.

36:10.903 --> 36:14.105
Don't work too hard trying
to convince yourself otherwise.

36:14.139 --> 36:16.441
We're good with your
murder investigation?

36:16.475 --> 36:18.142
What started out as an afternoon lay-up

36:18.177 --> 36:19.811
is now a full-blown whodunit.

36:19.845 --> 36:22.413
Sometimes these things
get away from you.

36:23.982 --> 36:25.917
Anybody need a paperweight?

36:27.786 --> 36:29.954
Whoa, that's evidence.
You break it, you buy it.

36:29.988 --> 36:31.989
Take up a collection. Thing's busted.

36:32.024 --> 36:33.391
Never recorded a frame,

36:33.425 --> 36:35.927
as if it's been wiped clean.

36:35.961 --> 36:38.996
Well, this whole precinct's
been jinxed recently,

36:39.031 --> 36:41.065
as if we picked up an albatross.

36:42.367 --> 36:45.002
Crack team you got here, Lieutenant.

36:45.037 --> 36:46.476
Yep.

36:46.939 --> 36:48.906
Except no carpenters.

36:49.245 --> 36:51.164
Well, you never know about people.

36:51.944 --> 36:54.717
For instance, Donnie Pomp.

36:55.280 --> 36:57.849
Even when I first saw the file,
I thought it was a misprint.

36:57.883 --> 36:59.628
What kind of name is Donnie Pomp?

37:00.052 --> 37:01.686
And then I come to find out
that he has this...

37:01.720 --> 37:03.354
this knockout of a girlfriend.

37:03.388 --> 37:05.356
Will you hand me the nails
there, please?

37:05.390 --> 37:08.359
And then, you know,
as I'm turning over rocks,

37:08.393 --> 37:10.027
things get interesting fast.

37:10.062 --> 37:12.330
I wish you'd start
getting interesting fast.

37:12.364 --> 37:15.099
It got awkward
talking to the girlfriend.

37:15.134 --> 37:16.968
I mean, how does this dumb bitch
not know

37:17.002 --> 37:19.101
the guy's smoking pole on the side?

37:20.005 --> 37:22.220
I man, blissful ignorance, I guess.

37:22.841 --> 37:25.477
Well, I got to find him anyway.

37:43.929 --> 37:45.463
Figured you didn't eat much today.

37:45.497 --> 37:46.998
I should just get you a key,

37:47.032 --> 37:49.694
save you the trouble
of a search warrant next time.

37:49.935 --> 37:52.203
You know the ex is the
first place a good cop looks.

37:52.237 --> 37:54.505
And you distanced yourself pretty fast.

37:54.540 --> 37:57.108
I didn't want
to complicate things for you.

38:10.122 --> 38:13.758
So, nothing from ballistics?
No witnesses?

38:13.792 --> 38:17.862
James, I'm sorry.

38:18.797 --> 38:19.931
It doesn't look promising.

38:19.965 --> 38:22.333
- So look harder.
- We will.

38:23.969 --> 38:25.937
But you know the odds, right?

38:25.971 --> 38:29.173
I mean, I'm sure there's a stack
of open, unsolved files

38:29.208 --> 38:30.347
on your desk right now.

38:30.381 --> 38:31.509
This is the woman I was gonna marry.

38:31.543 --> 38:33.033
She's not a file.

38:34.666 --> 38:36.200
None of them are.

38:43.455 --> 38:44.953
In your job,

38:46.892 --> 38:49.861
you ever have an instinct,
follow a gut feeling?

38:49.895 --> 38:52.230
- All the time.
- Yeah.

38:53.465 --> 38:55.032
Me too.

38:56.068 --> 38:57.969
Which is?

39:02.241 --> 39:05.476
Nothing good has come out of you and me.

39:11.450 --> 39:13.551
Do me a favor, look at me
when you say the next part.

39:13.585 --> 39:15.152
I need you to stay away from me.

39:33.005 --> 39:34.276
You know, all the way to this door,

39:34.311 --> 39:35.640
I thought you might stop me.

39:38.610 --> 39:40.149
So did I.

39:48.220 --> 39:51.656
I keep the rye just for you.

39:51.690 --> 39:55.459
- So nice to know
- that one's vices are remembered.

39:56.495 --> 39:58.362
As well as my phone number.

40:05.203 --> 40:09.440
That girl was not a part of this, Julia.

40:11.310 --> 40:12.977
It has to end.

40:13.011 --> 40:15.947
From where I'm sitting,
it never should've started.

40:15.981 --> 40:17.014
But here we are.

40:17.049 --> 40:20.418
I need you to stand down Bianchi.

40:20.986 --> 40:23.287
Put out a fire kindled by Matt Wozniak?

40:23.322 --> 40:24.455
Ooh, that's been a while.

40:24.489 --> 40:26.057
Well, if you can't broker a peace,

40:26.091 --> 40:30.161
then at least give me a war
without collateral damage.

40:30.195 --> 40:33.497
I will do what I can, but I
don't have a leash on Bianchi.

40:37.035 --> 40:39.574
And Harlee needs her gun back.

40:42.040 --> 40:45.476
And I need to know where all
this interest is coming from.

40:45.510 --> 40:47.695
You should understand

40:48.280 --> 40:50.414
that by not telling you,

40:50.449 --> 40:52.016
I'm protecting you.

40:52.050 --> 40:53.684
Matt, this is not an interrogation.

40:53.719 --> 40:55.353
Everything's an interrogation.

40:55.387 --> 40:57.154
That's the world we play in.

40:57.189 --> 40:59.657
It's a world I'm trying to change.

40:59.691 --> 41:01.492
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

41:04.296 --> 41:06.530
Where are you gonna start?

41:06.565 --> 41:08.532
With yourself?

41:11.370 --> 41:13.070
You know what I'm asking.

41:15.307 --> 41:18.609
How much have you changed, Julia?

41:34.993 --> 41:37.395
I still remember what you like.

41:50.609 --> 41:52.143
I'm not gonna be gentle.

41:52.177 --> 41:53.744
I don't deserve gentle.
