00:53.200 --> 00:55.766
- Gibbs.
- Hello, Gibbs.

00:55.790 --> 00:57.700
About that favor you owe me...

02:06.630 --> 02:08.789
Got here fast.

02:09.800 --> 02:11.270
Kort.

02:12.210 --> 02:16.056
I thought you were riding a desk at
the agency, ying to stay out of trouble.

02:16.080 --> 02:18.400
Guess that didn't work out.

02:19.180 --> 02:22.860
Afraid if I gave you too many
details, you wouldn't have shown.

02:23.540 --> 02:26.230
Think they shot each other.

02:26.580 --> 02:28.436
That the best story you got?

02:28.460 --> 02:30.086
One I'm sticking to.

02:30.110 --> 02:32.336
Don't know who he is.

02:32.360 --> 02:34.870
This one is Andre Vogel.

02:34.900 --> 02:38.556
High up in the organization
of Jonathan Siravo.

02:38.580 --> 02:43.106
You've heard of him.
Kidnapping, smuggling, piracy.

02:43.130 --> 02:46.256
See Siravo's picture every
day on our most wanted wall.

02:46.280 --> 02:48.976
Then I guess I'm doing
you another favor.

02:49.000 --> 02:54.186
Source in Malta tipped me Siravo
is back operating in the States.

02:54.210 --> 02:57.626
Supposed to show for a meet here today.

02:57.650 --> 03:03.006
Unfortunately, CIA has no
criminal jurisdiction domestically.

03:03.030 --> 03:05.656
It never seems to stop you.

03:05.680 --> 03:08.470
You legally can take him down, ibbs.

03:12.380 --> 03:14.400
Okay, so...

03:14.850 --> 03:16.926
you got here early to
check out the place?

03:16.950 --> 03:20.450
Yeah. Guess they had the same idea.

03:21.210 --> 03:23.840
Lucky for you, they
both shot each other.

03:24.530 --> 03:26.430
Yeah.

03:27.210 --> 03:30.290
.45 Your own weapon of choice.

03:30.610 --> 03:33.240
Carry a nine-millimeter these days.

03:34.250 --> 03:37.290
Any chance Siravo will still show?

03:37.840 --> 03:40.140
Call it a gut feeling.

03:45.770 --> 03:47.160
All right.

03:48.900 --> 03:51.340
Glad you could join us, McTardy.

03:51.380 --> 03:53.956
Where's the boss man? I need
a superior to sign off on this.

03:53.980 --> 03:57.190
Hand it over. I'm clearly
superior to you in so many ways.

03:57.740 --> 03:58.530
Where is Gibbs?

03:58.560 --> 04:00.000
We thought he might be with you.

04:00.030 --> 04:02.320
No, I've been at the range
doing my annual qualifications.

04:02.350 --> 04:05.286
Well, he has not been in this morning.
No empty coffee cup in his trash.

04:05.310 --> 04:08.156
Maybe he had an
appointment. Doctor, dentist.

04:08.180 --> 04:09.780
Check his calendar, McGee.

04:11.770 --> 04:15.466
No... soon as I start going through his stuff,
he is going to walk in and catch me. Forget it.

04:15.490 --> 04:18.620
I cannot believe this. I'll do it.

04:21.529 --> 04:25.840
Tony, watch the elevator.
McGee, the stairs. Now.

04:32.130 --> 04:35.596
Nothing... I don't even think
he knows how to use this thing.

04:35.620 --> 04:37.630
He lives alone... maybe
something happened to him.

04:37.660 --> 04:39.330
No one would know.

04:40.510 --> 04:44.150
In a tragic story of obsessive
hobbying turned deadly,

04:44.180 --> 04:46.920
an NCIS agent was
discovered in his basement,

04:46.970 --> 04:51.370
crushed between a large homemade boat
and an even larger bottle of bourbon.

04:51.850 --> 04:54.176
Film at 11:00. McGee, call him.

04:54.200 --> 04:56.856
And say what? "Oh, hey, boss,
we're just calling to check up you."

04:56.880 --> 04:58.930
No, you call him.

04:59.970 --> 05:02.360
- Not me.
- See if his cell phone's on.

05:08.660 --> 05:10.566
- Phone's on.
- Where is he?

05:10.590 --> 05:12.916
- Forget it... he's going to know.
- How would he know?

05:12.940 --> 05:13.846
Because he knows everything.

05:13.870 --> 05:16.390
McGee, do it. We need to know he's okay.

05:20.940 --> 05:23.790
He's in a two-block area of Anacostia.

05:25.080 --> 05:26.556
- It's him.
- We're dead.

05:26.580 --> 05:29.186
What do you mean, "we? You're
the one who tracked him down.

05:29.210 --> 05:31.430
Tony, pick it up, pick it up.

05:34.030 --> 05:35.636
- Hello?
- Saddle up.

05:35.660 --> 05:38.066
Oh, hey, boss. Where we going?

05:38.090 --> 05:40.490
Construction site, 625 East Rosewood.

05:40.520 --> 05:43.476
East Rosewood. Hey,
isn't that in Anacostia?

05:43.500 --> 05:45.710
That's a good guess, DiNozzo.

05:45.740 --> 05:47.796
Got a tip. No sirens.

05:47.820 --> 05:49.926
Jonathan Siravo is en route.

05:49.950 --> 05:52.140
Jonathan Siravo?

05:59.340 --> 06:01.840
Oh, we're taking tips from Trent Kort.

06:01.870 --> 06:04.700
Well, why don't we just run with
scissors or talk to strangers?

06:04.730 --> 06:06.340
Maybe they've got some candy.

06:06.370 --> 06:08.420
Go to hell, DiNozzo.

06:08.450 --> 06:10.660
Feels likee're halfway there.

06:11.130 --> 06:13.360
Didn't realize we were
processing a crime scene.

06:13.390 --> 06:15.096
We're not... yet.

06:15.120 --> 06:16.230
What happened?

06:16.270 --> 06:20.206
Got the tip about
Siravo. I called Gibbs.

06:20.230 --> 06:22.500
We got here and found the bodies.

06:22.540 --> 06:24.630
Looks like they killed each other.

06:25.460 --> 06:27.250
Sounds like crap. Boss?

06:27.660 --> 06:30.496
Siravo is our main
concern. Set up a perimeter.

06:30.520 --> 06:33.130
Kort and I are down here. Go.

06:35.740 --> 06:37.636
We do what Gibbs tells us.

06:37.660 --> 06:39.656
You don't really think those
two guys shot each other?

06:39.680 --> 06:41.226
Look, I dislike Kort as much as you do,

06:41.250 --> 06:42.546
- but the truth is...
- Oh, really?

06:42.570 --> 06:45.436
You dislike him as much
as me? He tried to kill me.

06:45.460 --> 06:47.790
He blew up my car.

06:48.060 --> 06:50.570
I'm sure he had his reasons.

07:05.020 --> 07:06.496
There's a sedan turning in.

07:06.520 --> 07:08.560
- Occupants?
- Just the driver.

07:09.250 --> 07:11.250
Got a visual.

07:13.370 --> 07:15.660
Car is stopping.

07:30.910 --> 07:33.620
Federal agents! Don't move.

07:39.080 --> 07:41.380
Who the hell are you?

07:49.840 --> 07:53.366
Perry Sterling, 49. CPA,
certified in Maryland.

07:53.390 --> 07:56.126
Currently resides in
Virginia. No record.

07:56.150 --> 07:57.960
Graduated cum laude from Princeton.

07:57.990 --> 08:00.230
Is there any connection
between Perry and Siravo.

08:00.270 --> 08:01.796
None that we have found.

08:01.820 --> 08:04.630
Jonathan Siravo, insurance
salesman, no record,

08:04.660 --> 08:07.830
suffered a head trauma from a
motorcycle accident six years ago.

08:07.870 --> 08:10.240
Disappeared from the recovery
room following surgery.

08:10.300 --> 08:13.430
Reappeared one year later
as a major crime lord.

08:13.470 --> 08:14.950
A severe personality shift.

08:14.980 --> 08:20.420
Well, according to NSA and Interpol, Siravo's
enterprise has spread to drug smuggling in Mexico,

08:20.450 --> 08:24.400
kidnapping in Bolivia and an
interest in a Ukraine pipeline.

08:24.430 --> 08:25.970
His finger is in many eyes.

08:26.000 --> 08:26.690
Pies.

08:26.730 --> 08:29.776
Guy moving that much money should be
leaving a paper trail, but he doesn't.

08:29.800 --> 08:31.356
Guess that's why he's still in business.

08:31.380 --> 08:36.520
NSG intercepts show Siravo's hired a gang
of Salian fishermen to hijack ships at sea,

08:36.559 --> 08:40.196
and most recently a cargo
vessel by the name of Borealis.

08:40.220 --> 08:43.086
Panamanian register. Went missing
this morning in the Gulf of Aden.

08:43.110 --> 08:45.640
Carrying military
parts and a crew of 27.

08:45.670 --> 08:47.786
Siravo having more
weapons... not a good thing.

08:47.810 --> 08:49.586
We need this guy now.

08:49.610 --> 08:52.380
Then, Gibbs better get Perry talking.

09:00.560 --> 09:02.356
Director Vance.

09:02.380 --> 09:05.906
I heard you were our tip
on this double homicide.

09:05.930 --> 09:07.446
Just sharing intel.

09:07.470 --> 09:09.350
On a CIA op?

09:09.400 --> 09:12.060
On American soil?

09:12.460 --> 09:15.626
There is no op. Hence my call to Gibbs.

09:15.650 --> 09:17.430
Ah, by the book now?

09:17.460 --> 09:18.860
It's a new day.

09:18.890 --> 09:21.060
Yes, we can.

09:21.100 --> 09:24.466
And you two just happened to show
up at the end of the gun battle.

09:24.490 --> 09:26.570
Timing is everything.

09:47.950 --> 09:52.650
Look, it's my busy season, and I'm running
around like a chicken with its head cut off.

09:52.690 --> 09:56.750
And all I'm thinking... well, would be
thinking if my head wasn't cut off...

09:57.940 --> 10:03.320
is how to account for...
overflow expenditures.

10:07.350 --> 10:10.166
I'm looking for Arlington.

10:10.190 --> 10:12.970
I take Anacostia...
Obviously a mistake...

10:13.000 --> 10:17.646
But my cell takes a dump, and
then my car navigational system

10:17.670 --> 10:22.090
is whining to make an illegal U-turn, and I
don't even think she knows where we're going.

10:25.790 --> 10:29.686
I was... asking for directions.

10:29.710 --> 10:32.300
Jonathan Siravo.

10:34.740 --> 10:36.196
I'm his accountant.

10:36.220 --> 10:37.820
You launder his money.

10:38.900 --> 10:42.556
Yeah. He responds to my creativity.

10:42.580 --> 10:46.890
I respond to his... terrifying demeanor.

10:49.500 --> 10:56.010
I divert cash through monetary
exchanges, take profits from stolen goods,

10:56.050 --> 11:00.426
form shell companies, resell the
stuff, then make it look legit.

11:00.450 --> 11:05.626
We meet when he's in the States,
strategize on investments.

11:05.650 --> 11:08.510
Like the cargo ship Borealis.

11:09.710 --> 11:11.460
Not one of his holdings.

11:11.490 --> 11:14.366
It's missing, along
with its entire crew.

11:14.390 --> 11:16.520
I don't know anything about that.

11:16.550 --> 11:20.976
Siravo hires Somalian
fishermen to hijack ships.

11:21.000 --> 11:23.736
They'll gut the crew.
Throw them overboard.

11:23.760 --> 11:28.100
27 lives are in your hands.

11:30.430 --> 11:33.440
I want to help you, I really
do, but I can't give you Siravo.

11:33.480 --> 11:37.500
I do and I'm dead. He can get
to anybody, any time, anywhere.

11:40.480 --> 11:42.730
I need immunity.

11:46.420 --> 11:48.070
Stay here.

11:56.070 --> 11:58.476
I'll contact the U.S.Attorney.

11:58.500 --> 12:00.626
They won't let him walk
without a full polygraph.

12:00.650 --> 12:02.040
It's gonna take time.

12:02.070 --> 12:05.350
Okay, I'll keep Perry on
ice. Check out his story.

12:05.620 --> 12:07.140
And Kort's?

12:07.170 --> 12:09.960
He calls you, you pull
up, shots ring out.

12:09.990 --> 12:13.476
Not quite, Leon. It was
already ove when we got there.

12:13.500 --> 12:15.160
**********

12:15.190 --> 12:17.330
I didn't know what it was yet.

12:18.470 --> 12:20.970
It was Kort.

12:22.160 --> 12:25.580
Abby, it did not fall out
when I removed their clothes.

12:25.610 --> 12:27.890
Then it's a disappearing act, Ducky.

12:27.920 --> 12:29.750
You have two bodies down there.

12:29.780 --> 12:32.356
- Last time I checked.
- From which you have extracted.

12:32.380 --> 12:33.486
Three slugs!

12:33.510 --> 12:36.920
Okey. Kill-shot on the first
man came from a forty-five.

12:36.960 --> 12:41.026
Double-tap on the second came
from the first man's Scorpion 380.

12:41.050 --> 12:47.250
But I have hala dozen shell casings down here
from a third gun which seems to be nowhere...

12:47.680 --> 12:48.686
Bye, Ducky.

12:48.710 --> 12:52.200
Crime scene's not a priority.
The link to Siravo is.

12:54.000 --> 12:57.296
Okay. I recovered cell phones
from both the dead guys,

12:57.320 --> 13:00.436
and a Blackberry, and a
laptop from Perry Sterling.

13:00.460 --> 13:03.676
So far, nothing on the phones has
given us anything to track Siravo.

13:03.700 --> 13:06.056
Laptop. No. Perry's no fool.

13:06.080 --> 13:08.346
He'd keep all the important
information in his head.

13:08.370 --> 13:10.076
He is a killer gamer, though.

13:10.100 --> 13:12.740
And he plays a boatload of Sims.

13:12.970 --> 13:14.180
Translation... video games.

13:14.220 --> 13:17.696
The rest of it is mostly
spreadsheets, bank accounts and porn.

13:17.720 --> 13:20.336
Spreadsheets and porn... that's
two totally different things.

13:20.360 --> 13:22.676
- Yeah. I already know that, Abb.
- Okay. I was just checking.

13:22.700 --> 13:25.260
So, basically, you've got nothing.

13:25.800 --> 13:30.690
Nothing? Gibbs, I have the
mystery of the missing gun.

13:31.190 --> 13:33.996
A third gun suggests ahird shooter.

13:34.020 --> 13:37.786
This is Caf-POW! Country, but
yet there's no Caf-POW! Anywhere.

13:37.810 --> 13:39.300
Looks inconclusive.

13:39.340 --> 13:41.536
Inconclusive?

13:41.560 --> 13:46.500
Gibbs, I just told you that there was a
third shooter at the construction site.

13:48.240 --> 13:51.526
But I could always
go double-check that.

13:51.550 --> 13:54.550
Very... slowly.

13:55.320 --> 13:57.100
Yeah. Gibbs.

13:59.040 --> 14:00.930
Status on the Borealis.

14:00.960 --> 14:03.380
It's a boat, and it's missing.

14:03.430 --> 14:06.620
Status on you is, you're really
irritating, and I wish you were missing.

14:07.040 --> 14:08.966
DiNozzo, like it or not...

14:08.990 --> 14:10.660
It's "not".

14:10.690 --> 14:13.076
We're on the same side.

14:13.100 --> 14:15.650
I see your lips moving, but
all I hear is, "Lie, lie, lie."

14:15.690 --> 14:17.470
And I don't know what's more insulting.

14:17.500 --> 14:21.220
The fact that you're trying to use us, or you
think we're dumb enough to actually buy it.

14:21.250 --> 14:24.640
Someone's buying. I'm in the building.

14:31.600 --> 14:37.286
Oh no. That visitor's badge only gets you
in the lobby. It's not a backstage pass.

14:37.310 --> 14:38.696
I'll tell you what, though.

14:38.720 --> 14:42.340
What you can do is run downstairs to the
gift shop, get yourself something nice.

14:42.370 --> 14:46.100
Like a mug or a T-shirt,
or a personality.

14:51.060 --> 14:54.976
International Maritime Bureau
confirmed a location for the Borealis.

14:55.000 --> 14:56.496
- Where?
- Indian Ocean.

14:56.520 --> 15:00.030
Captain spotted Siravo's vessel
approaching, and he took evasive action.

15:00.070 --> 15:01.570
Lost their Comets in a firefight.

15:01.600 --> 15:03.070
They were boarded?

15:03.100 --> 15:05.590
No, the pirates never made it on board.

15:05.620 --> 15:07.270
Then what are we looking at?

15:07.300 --> 15:09.200
Rewind.

15:10.480 --> 15:12.156
That's the pirate steamer.

15:12.180 --> 15:13.980
Crew of the Borealis is fine.

15:14.020 --> 15:16.160
No survivors from the
steamer's explosion.

15:16.190 --> 15:19.626
Salvage crew says it looks
like remote detonated ordnance.

15:19.650 --> 15:25.386
So, this morning, two of Siravo's men suosedly
gun each other down at the construction site.

15:25.410 --> 15:28.110
And now, someone plants
a bomb on his ship.

15:28.150 --> 15:31.780
Someone is taking out
Siravo's entire crew.

15:41.055 --> 15:43.345
Come on!

15:44.801 --> 15:48.081
I should ask for the tops
that aren't childproof.

15:52.620 --> 15:53.926
Masalamine.

15:53.950 --> 15:56.706
For collagenous colitis.
Tried Prevacid for GERD.

15:56.730 --> 15:59.616
Gastroesophageal reflux disorder.

15:59.640 --> 16:03.600
Apparently, I need an upper-bowel
study done to know what it is for sure.

16:03.640 --> 16:07.490
They thought it was celiac disease and
told me to stop eating so much gluten.

16:07.530 --> 16:10.016
I didn't even know I
was eating any gluten.

16:10.040 --> 16:12.350
Yeah, stress can't help much.

16:14.230 --> 16:17.590
Two bodies this morning in Anacostia.

16:18.450 --> 16:21.790
Nine more of his crew
in the Indian Ocean.

16:24.620 --> 16:26.900
- He's liquidating.
- Who?

16:27.350 --> 16:29.880
Siravo.

16:30.980 --> 16:32.486
I should have seen it.

16:32.510 --> 16:35.636
He had me consolidate his
funds. Almost 300 million.

16:35.660 --> 16:38.296
He's made his fortune. Closing up shop.

16:38.320 --> 16:40.690
Leaves no use for you.

16:43.940 --> 16:46.170
He was gonna kill me, wasn't he?

16:46.210 --> 16:48.510
He still might.

16:50.250 --> 16:52.336
Last one. Can I have some water?

16:52.360 --> 16:54.880
First immunity, now water?

16:54.910 --> 16:56.796
- No more demands.
- I hate to dry swallow.

16:56.820 --> 16:59.180
Siravo, account numbers.

16:59.220 --> 17:01.390
Not without immunity.

17:03.030 --> 17:05.046
I'll give you a name. Victor Flores.

17:05.069 --> 17:06.665
Flores is Siravo's number two.

17:06.690 --> 17:08.606
I already know that.

17:08.630 --> 17:11.280
I know how to get a hold of him!

17:16.869 --> 17:18.810
How?

17:19.630 --> 17:22.896
Have you ever
playedCaptains of Industry 3?

17:22.920 --> 17:25.250
Captains of Industry 3...

17:25.310 --> 17:30.706
The completely unnecessary third
installment of the not-so-popular sequel.

17:30.730 --> 17:35.850
Capturing all the fun of being a corporate CEO
and building your very own business empire.

17:36.220 --> 17:38.370
Not playtime, Elf Lord.

17:38.400 --> 17:39.690
You got that right.

17:39.720 --> 17:44.286
COI3 was universally panned
as '08's worst MMORPG.

17:44.310 --> 17:46.190
It sucks.

17:46.220 --> 17:51.480
Sohy was Perry spending up to
seven hours a day playing it online?

17:52.030 --> 17:54.196
- He sucks?
- Maybe.

17:54.220 --> 17:59.720
Still, what would he get from
COI3... a game that nobody plays?

18:00.770 --> 18:04.410
Real-time communications
in uncrowded chat rooms.

18:04.440 --> 18:07.866
You can message people to discuss
game strategy, talk trash...

18:07.890 --> 18:12.576
Or send their llow criminals messages.

18:12.600 --> 18:13.890
Coded messages.

18:13.940 --> 18:15.910
We have all of Perry's
account information.

18:15.950 --> 18:17.470
We can read his chats.

18:17.510 --> 18:19.750
That's a lot of chatter to decode.

18:20.520 --> 18:24.000
McGee, it's playtime.

18:24.390 --> 18:26.876
According to Perry, Victor
Flores is in the number-two slot.

18:26.900 --> 18:29.470
Flores is a munitions
expert, likely the button man.

18:29.520 --> 18:31.736
Contacting him may be the
only way to get to Siravo.

18:31.760 --> 18:33.360
Not that he'll be too willing to talk.

18:33.400 --> 18:36.040
Been a lot of internal bloodshed.

18:37.170 --> 18:40.960
We're still kicking around
theories about Killian and Vogel.

18:40.990 --> 18:43.366
Would you care to chime in?

18:43.390 --> 18:45.310
Double-suicide pact.

18:45.350 --> 18:49.210
Secret lovers couldn't stand
to live a lie any longer.

18:49.520 --> 18:53.060
Too many question marks. DiNozzo, safe
house for Perry. Take Ziva with you.

18:53.720 --> 18:55.870
Secret lovers.

19:00.480 --> 19:02.390
Don't touch any of my stuff.

19:06.930 --> 19:08.890
Keeping me on a short leash, Gibbs?

19:08.920 --> 19:11.346
Yeah, and a muzzle if I have to.

19:11.370 --> 19:14.206
I thought we'd turned a
corner in our relationship.

19:14.230 --> 19:18.180
You ask me for something,
I ask you for something.

19:19.220 --> 19:21.966
I didn't ask you to
dig up dirt on Vance.

19:21.990 --> 19:24.230
But you read the file anyway.

19:24.260 --> 19:27.450
No, I don't waste time on fiction.

19:28.950 --> 19:33.630
Gibbs, what motivation would
I ever have to mislead you?

19:35.440 --> 19:38.200
I respect that you're suspicious.

19:38.230 --> 19:41.150
Caution is an asset in our line of work.

19:41.180 --> 19:44.396
Trust is elusive at best.

19:44.420 --> 19:47.540
No, it's not, not between
us. It's impossible.

19:49.330 --> 19:51.700
But I honor my debts.

19:53.470 --> 19:55.826
Such nobility.

19:55.850 --> 19:59.580
Somewhat hollow given
your fallback position.

20:00.260 --> 20:03.070
You're not really sticking
your neck out for me.

20:03.110 --> 20:06.936
Vance comes down on you, you're already
thinking you've got the goods on him.

20:06.960 --> 20:10.326
Words are cheap. Actions speak louder.

20:10.350 --> 20:16.170
Or to put it in parlance you'd
understand: Measure twice, cut once.

20:20.380 --> 20:22.936
Doesn't look that safe to
me. Why aren't we in a hotel?

20:22.960 --> 20:24.390
Haven't you ever seen Bullitt?

20:24.420 --> 20:26.816
Bellhops, maids, room
service... it's all a bad idea.

20:26.840 --> 20:28.830
No one knows we're here.

20:29.300 --> 20:31.850
- Ugh, this hall smells.
- God.

20:34.470 --> 20:36.050
Ugh, it's musty.

20:36.080 --> 20:37.380
How about some fresh air?

20:37.410 --> 20:39.310
Stay away from the windows and the door.

20:39.340 --> 20:40.370
And the wet bar.

20:40.410 --> 20:42.970
Oh, this is going to be a lot of fun.

20:44.060 --> 20:47.756
Oh, gosh, place is a mess. Whoever
was here last didn't clean up.

20:47.780 --> 20:49.786
That would be me and McGee.

20:49.810 --> 20:51.870
Hmm, let me guess... basic cable.

20:51.910 --> 20:54.116
Uncle Sam's dime.

20:54.140 --> 20:56.316
I'm a very light sleeper.

20:56.340 --> 20:58.110
I can't share a room with anyone else.

20:58.140 --> 21:00.120
- Was not an option.
- Well...

21:06.490 --> 21:07.800
I haven't eaten all day.

21:07.850 --> 21:10.330
Any chance we can
arrange an early dinner?

21:14.740 --> 21:16.630
Local cuisine.

21:17.710 --> 21:21.170
I have a very delicate stomach.

21:22.090 --> 21:25.356
I'm on a strict macrobiotic diet.

21:25.380 --> 21:27.470
Can't wait to see what happens.

21:28.190 --> 21:30.870
I'm gonna kill this
guy before Siravo does.

21:31.560 --> 21:34.880
McGee, that's a terrible
place to put a railroad spur.

21:34.910 --> 21:36.806
You're never going to get
clearance from the city officials.

21:36.830 --> 21:39.826
Excuse me, I made a six-figure charitable
contribution to the councilman's fund,

21:39.850 --> 21:41.770
so he's going to cut
me a pretty sweet deal.

21:41.810 --> 21:43.816
Not with the price of iron skyrocketing.

21:43.840 --> 21:47.190
You should have taken the deal
with the guy from Singapore.

21:47.780 --> 21:50.756
It's all part of the process. Right?

21:50.780 --> 21:53.806
Yeah. Messaging with people from around
the world... that's how you play the game.

21:53.830 --> 21:57.300
So, Perry... he looks like he's playing,
but he's actually communicating with Flores.

21:57.330 --> 21:59.470
Sending and receiving coded messages.

21:59.510 --> 22:02.060
Perry told us where to find
the cipher key on his laptop.

22:02.100 --> 22:05.696
Now, they use terms from the game.
For instance, steel means guns.

22:05.720 --> 22:07.016
Hos*******

22:07.040 --> 22:08.730
Hospitals are for emergencies.

22:08.770 --> 22:11.980
Or a deal gone bad, or a
problem with law enforcement.

22:12.010 --> 22:13.696
- Cabbage is...
- Money.

22:13.720 --> 22:15.016
You know how to communicate with Flores?

22:15.040 --> 22:17.810
Oh, yeah. We have been. We're
trying to set up a meet now.

22:18.140 --> 22:19.980
We can't track this guy, his character?

22:20.020 --> 22:23.816
Well, Flores uses any of a dozen
characters in scattered locations.

22:23.840 --> 22:25.590
It's the Wild West in here, Gibbs.

22:25.620 --> 22:28.140
But, boss, you are
looking at the sheriff.

22:31.060 --> 22:32.620
Ooh, we got a response.

22:32.650 --> 22:35.430
Flores wants to meet Perry
at the Stone Basin Hospital.

22:35.460 --> 22:39.636
Which, according to the cipher key,
means emergency meeting, Rock Creek.

22:39.660 --> 22:41.860
- The park.
- In an hour.

22:44.760 --> 22:47.390
Ooh, pork bellies are falling.

22:49.720 --> 22:51.886
School was never fun as a kid.

22:51.910 --> 22:53.726
I wasn't into sports.

22:53.750 --> 22:56.140
And I was always nervous around girls.

22:56.180 --> 22:58.250
I didn't have a lot of friends.

22:58.280 --> 23:02.290
My parents thought if I got
a pet, maybe that would help.

23:02.320 --> 23:04.106
- Sounds like a good idea.
- Yeah.

23:04.130 --> 23:06.290
That's when we found
out about my allergies.

23:06.630 --> 23:08.970
Had to give Buttons to a cousin.

23:09.720 --> 23:12.190
You know, you're not a bad-looking guy.

23:13.310 --> 23:15.396
- You're being kind.
- No.

23:15.420 --> 23:19.010
Actually, I cannot believe
you never had a girlfriend.

23:19.430 --> 23:23.796
Well, there was a girl I kind of dated
for a semester, sophomore year of college.

23:23.820 --> 23:25.816
Yeah?

23:25.840 --> 23:27.556
She was just using me.

23:27.580 --> 23:32.326
Soon as she passed Econ Statistics
Analysis 340, I never heard from her again.

23:32.350 --> 23:37.240
Ironically, I thought earning a lot
of money would help me with women.

23:37.280 --> 23:40.160
Now it turns out, all it's
going to get me is prison...

23:40.490 --> 23:43.060
omurdered.

23:45.360 --> 23:48.360
Danger is a turn-on for women, right?

23:49.880 --> 23:51.520
Some women.

23:52.780 --> 23:54.200
Yeah.

24:01.170 --> 24:03.600
Come on, open up. Food's getting cold.

24:04.890 --> 24:06.730
How are you?

24:08.750 --> 24:10.556
Any word on my immunity?

24:10.580 --> 24:13.826
Well, I hear zinc lozenges help. You might
want to try some vitamin C or echinacea.

24:13.850 --> 24:15.750
Oh, you mean your immunity? No.

24:19.160 --> 24:21.176
I need to take one with every meal.

24:21.200 --> 24:23.286
- You can skip a meal, Pry.
- Trust me.

24:23.310 --> 24:28.820
You don't want to be in this small apartment
with me if I haven't had my medicine.

24:41.470 --> 24:43.426
Flores got here early.

24:43.450 --> 24:45.940
Mae we read the codes wrong.

24:53.000 --> 24:54.580
It's clear.

25:11.670 --> 25:13.610
Found Flores!

25:14.740 --> 25:16.870
Then who is this?

25:32.010 --> 25:35.006
Guess we're not gonna be
talking to Siravo's number two.

25:35.030 --> 25:36.770
So much for Perry's hot tip, huh?

25:36.800 --> 25:39.766
On the contrary, McGee.
Flores is still warm.

25:39.790 --> 25:42.886
97.8, to be exact.

25:42.910 --> 25:46.480
This man was killed less
than half an hour ago.

25:46.510 --> 25:48.490
97.7 on this body, Doctor.

25:48.540 --> 25:51.610
Yeah, both men wer killed at
approximately the same time.

25:51.640 --> 25:53.956
We've seen that before, Jethro.

25:53.980 --> 25:56.890
What is it you say about coincidence?

25:59.510 --> 26:01.920
Care to dance, Gibbs?

26:03.110 --> 26:05.196
Flores is smoking here.

26:05.220 --> 26:08.200
First shot hits him in the leg.

26:08.230 --> 26:10.386
He goes to take cover.

26:10.410 --> 26:12.406
Draws his weapon.

26:12.430 --> 26:15.230
Wounded, he takes a shot.

26:15.260 --> 26:16.520
More than one.

26:16.550 --> 26:18.150
Two bullets hit this tree.

26:18.180 --> 26:21.036
Plus one iour second dead man's gut.

26:21.060 --> 26:22.640
Now we're both wounded.

26:22.670 --> 26:24.780
But I step out to take another shot.

26:24.810 --> 26:28.110
I'm hit, but you're hit worse.

26:28.610 --> 26:31.540
I step up, and I put
one right in your heart.

26:35.820 --> 26:38.856
Considering you're about to
die, that was a hell of a shot.

26:38.880 --> 26:42.020
Boss, second body is Luther Rake.

26:42.050 --> 26:44.026
Uh, found his car down the road.

26:44.050 --> 26:47.800
According to our intel, he's
low-level muscle r Siravo.

26:47.830 --> 26:49.786
He and Flores worked for the same guy.

26:49.810 --> 26:51.270
Not a coincidence.

26:51.300 --> 26:54.776
Siravo hired Rake to hit Flores.

26:54.800 --> 26:56.476
Flores hit back.

26:56.500 --> 26:58.700
Body count's rising fast.

26:59.360 --> 27:01.120
You're expecting one living guy.

27:01.160 --> 27:03.820
Instead, you find two dead guys.

27:03.870 --> 27:05.650
Both Siravo's.

27:05.690 --> 27:09.130
He sent Rake after Flores
before we could pick him up.

27:09.530 --> 27:12.280
Only one way Siravo gets
that kind of heads-up.

27:12.330 --> 27:13.946
We got a leak.

27:13.970 --> 27:15.916
Means Siravo knows we got Perry.

27:15.940 --> 27:17.706
I want to know who told him.

27:17.730 --> 27:20.406
Maybe we should start
with your buddy Kort.

27:20.430 --> 27:21.676
He's not my buddy.

27:21.700 --> 27:23.700
Could have fooled me.

27:24.050 --> 27:26.166
I made some phone calls.

27:26.190 --> 27:28.540
Trent Kort's been benched.

27:28.570 --> 27:31.800
Siravo hasn't been on the
CIA's radar in six months.

27:31.840 --> 27:35.046
What's Kort doing digging
around in the trash?

27:35.070 --> 27:37.330
He's got his uses.

27:41.950 --> 27:44.410
Kort gave you my file.

27:45.220 --> 27:47.560
I'm only concerned about Siravo.

27:47.590 --> 27:49.866
What's Kort interested in?

27:49.890 --> 27:52.550
God and country.

27:53.960 --> 27:58.266
Trent Kort shows up bearing gifts.

27:58.290 --> 28:00.680
I want to know what's in it for him.

28:01.110 --> 28:05.610
Ent Kort does not gain anything
by leaking information, Leon.

28:05.650 --> 28:07.806
Then I want to know who does.

28:07.830 --> 28:10.146
Find the leak. Find Siravo.

28:10.170 --> 28:13.430
I want the CIA out of my house.

28:21.170 --> 28:23.460
Must have hard water here.

28:24.130 --> 28:27.020
What are you looking at? Eat
your free-range banana muffin.

28:28.640 --> 28:32.396
If Siravo could get to Flores,
he'll be able to get to me.

28:32.420 --> 28:34.270
I'm a dead man for sure.

28:34.300 --> 28:35.800
Cool your jets, Perry.

28:35.830 --> 28:39.140
U.S.Marshals are on their over
to get you right now anyway.

28:39.830 --> 28:41.516
My immunity came through?

28:41.540 --> 28:44.120
Yeah. I wouldn't get too excited.

28:44.380 --> 28:47.560
You are gonna have to spill
your guts to the U.S.attorney.

28:47.590 --> 28:50.040
- Not a problem.
- Really?

28:50.450 --> 28:52.116
You're gonna have to pass a polygraph.

28:52.140 --> 28:54.070
There's gonna be a trial.

28:54.100 --> 28:56.396
You'll have to testify.

28:56.420 --> 29:01.360
You're going to be shuttling back and forth
between these lousy safe houses for the next year.

29:01.710 --> 29:03.130
I've got an idea.

29:03.190 --> 29:07.050
Why don't you just tell us
Siravo's account numbers?

29:08.920 --> 29:11.856
What do you mean lousy safe houses?

29:11.880 --> 29:15.256
Four bodies with a
total of seven wounds.

29:15.280 --> 29:16.380
From seven bullets.

29:16.410 --> 29:17.980
Fired from four guns.

29:18.020 --> 29:20.300
All of which are in evidence.

29:20.370 --> 29:22.680
We have the means and the murderers.

29:22.720 --> 29:27.600
Each body sings a different
harmony to the same song.

29:27.630 --> 29:30.430
Yeah, like a barbershop quartet.

29:30.800 --> 29:32.876
- Case closed.
- No, no.

29:32.900 --> 29:37.020
I was thinking more
of... Badum, badum, badee.

29:38.000 --> 29:40.270
Let the punishment fit the crime.

29:40.310 --> 29:41.660
Gilbert and Sullivan.

29:41.690 --> 29:44.680
Opera doesn't exactly
translate to barbershop quartet.

29:46.590 --> 29:49.896
Of course, you would know
that, being a lover of opera.

29:49.920 --> 29:53.160
And you a lover of thearbehop quartet?

29:53.630 --> 29:55.886
It was college. I was a tenor.

29:55.910 --> 29:59.946
We were known as the PB
& Js. I was one of the Js.

29:59.970 --> 30:01.050
Yeah, really?

30:01.080 --> 30:04.240
Yeah, we modeled our look after
the Dapper Dans of Disneyland.

30:04.290 --> 30:06.996
We had the, uh... the
vests, the sleeve garters.

30:07.020 --> 30:10.480
Yeah, the-the straw boater
hats. Still have them at home.

30:11.720 --> 30:12.900
We were good.

30:12.940 --> 30:17.880
Well, the element that makes barbershop
music unique is called the fifth note.

30:17.910 --> 30:23.406
Yeah, a specific acoustical effect found in
the harmony, also known as a ringing chord.

30:23.430 --> 30:26.436
Something you can only hear when
all four voices sing together.

30:26.460 --> 30:29.396
Yeah. Something our quartet lacks.

30:29.420 --> 30:33.636
Something that only all four
bodies could tell us in unison.

30:33.660 --> 30:35.616
We need a connection.

30:35.640 --> 30:38.610
- Horse manure.
- Horse manure?

30:40.190 --> 30:44.326
Uh, yes. We did find traces
of a substance on their hands

30:44.350 --> 30:47.496
and under the fingernails
of our dearly departed.

30:47.520 --> 30:49.966
Yeah. So did Abby, on their shoes.

30:49.990 --> 30:52.310
Well, perhaps that's our connection.

30:52.340 --> 30:57.710
Yeah, traces of horse manure on every one of
them, suggesting all four were on a farm or ranch.

30:57.740 --> 31:00.246
According to the chemical
breakdown of the manure...

31:00.270 --> 31:01.886
Same ranch.

31:01.910 --> 31:05.196
If all four men worked for
Siravo, then it's safe to say that

31:05.220 --> 31:09.280
that ranch was a meeting
place for his employees.

31:09.310 --> 31:11.170
Maybe even Siravo himself.

31:11.210 --> 31:13.006
Yeah, Duck, maybe.

31:13.030 --> 31:19.990
Thank you, gentlemen. Perfect harmony.

31:31.070 --> 31:32.750
Tony, we have been compromised.

31:32.790 --> 31:34.406
What are you talking about,
Ziva? Is this a drill?

31:34.430 --> 31:36.426
Did she get my medicine?

31:36.450 --> 31:38.796
I'm going in the back.

31:38.820 --> 31:41.366
- Come here. Let's go.
- What?

31:41.390 --> 31:42.840
What are you doing?

31:43.800 --> 31:45.870
Let's go, Perry!

31:49.800 --> 31:50.630
We got to go?

31:50.660 --> 31:52.636
We are more vulnerable
in transit. Take cover.

31:52.660 --> 31:55.356
- What's she gonna do?
- You know, I don't really know.

31:55.380 --> 31:57.570
Bathroom now!

32:01.670 --> 32:04.646
- Yeah. Gibbs.
- We have a situation at the safe house.

32:04.670 --> 32:06.970
Well, yeah, Ziva. What is it?

32:08.260 --> 32:10.470
Just a second.

32:20.840 --> 32:24.060
Ziva? Ziva!

32:24.990 --> 32:27.160
Ziva, talk to me!

32:27.480 --> 32:29.750
Under control.

32:34.600 --> 32:36.456
You okay?

32:36.480 --> 32:39.280
Your medicine. You
look like you need it.

32:40.080 --> 32:44.010
Stand down! U.S.Marshals!

32:45.620 --> 32:48.230
NCIS!

32:49.620 --> 32:52.080
Coming out!

32:53.900 --> 32:57.720
Here you go, gentlemen. He's all yours.

32:58.190 --> 33:00.300
Thanks. Let's go.

33:06.740 --> 33:09.110
That's a job well done.

33:13.130 --> 33:15.746
Abby, no one was hurt.
Tony and Ziva are fine.

33:15.770 --> 33:17.010
They're not fine!

33:17.040 --> 33:19.440
Not as long as someone
is leaking information.

33:19.470 --> 33:24.700
I mean, how else would Siravo have known about
our meeting with Flores and that we had Perry?

33:25.700 --> 33:29.566
See? No one is safe
until I find this leak.

33:29.590 --> 33:31.556
- Any luck?
- No!

33:31.580 --> 33:35.630
There were no unusual outgoing
calls from the NCIS switchboard.

33:35.920 --> 33:38.586
I ran all the phone numbers for
everyone with knowledge of the crime:

33:38.610 --> 33:42.810
Gibbs, Tony, Ziva, you,
me... home, cell and office.

33:42.840 --> 33:44.886
You ran your own home phone records?

33:44.910 --> 33:47.460
Yeah. Gibbs' orders.

33:47.900 --> 33:51.486
Well, what about the Internet? There could
be a virus or Trojan horse on the network.

33:51.510 --> 33:54.720
I already checked all incoming
and outgoi network communications.

33:54.760 --> 33:58.156
All the firewalls are in place.
The TCP servers are secure.

33:58.180 --> 34:02.046
If there's a leak, it's not coming from this
building, and I don't know where else to look.

34:02.070 --> 34:03.620
Try this.

34:03.650 --> 34:06.046
- Whose number is this?
- Kort?

34:06.070 --> 34:09.010
Run it. What do you got?

34:10.380 --> 34:13.380
Dashboard navigation systems
from the two vehicles at the park.

34:13.409 --> 34:15.170
Tracking where Siravo's men have been.

34:15.199 --> 34:16.806
See if there was any common location.

34:16.830 --> 34:19.065
You mean, other than
where they both died.

34:19.090 --> 34:22.966
Okay. Now, there's only one other
location shows up in both nav systems.

34:22.989 --> 34:24.860
Put it up.

34:26.139 --> 34:29.150
1314 Walnut Forest
Road in Stafford County.

34:29.179 --> 34:30.650
That looks like stables.

34:30.679 --> 34:32.545
- It's a horse ranch.
- Siravo's hideout.

34:32.570 --> 34:35.860
Grab DiNozzo, Ziva.
Evidence garage in five.

34:39.409 --> 34:40.786
Looking for a fight, Gibbs?

34:40.810 --> 34:42.310
We're looking for Siravo's crew.

34:42.350 --> 34:43.520
What happened to the wiggler?

34:43.550 --> 34:45.835
Sterling's federal
marshals' problem now.

34:45.860 --> 34:47.085
Need another gun?

34:47.110 --> 34:49.820
Actually, we're out of vests, but
you can go commando if you want.

34:49.850 --> 34:52.590
- DiNozzo, get in the damn car!
- Getting in the car, boss.

34:55.920 --> 34:58.040
Where are you going, Gibbs?

35:34.350 --> 35:36.390
Federal agents!

35:40.000 --> 35:41.940
Not much of a headquarters.

35:43.880 --> 35:46.130
Who is he?

35:46.640 --> 35:48.866
Face does look familiar.

35:48.890 --> 35:52.010
- It should.
- Because it's on our wall.

35:53.570 --> 35:56.640
It's our criminal
mastermind, Jonathan Siravo.

36:04.000 --> 36:06.946
In a topsy-turvy world
where nothing is as it seems,

36:06.970 --> 36:09.380
the one place you can
turn to is The Wall.

36:09.410 --> 36:12.790
Ran his prints, the coma man
is, indeed, Jonathan Siravo.

36:12.820 --> 36:14.420
Yes, the Master of Pirates...

36:14.460 --> 36:18.286
Can't change his diapers, but running
an international crime syndicate?

36:18.310 --> 36:19.730
That he can do in his sleep.

36:19.770 --> 36:20.790
You lied to me, Wall!

36:20.820 --> 36:25.430
We have half-a-dozen bodies downstairs, another
nine floating on the other side of the world.

36:25.470 --> 36:27.600
Someone is responsible for them.

36:27.630 --> 36:29.380
Well, you're responsible
for a some of them.

36:29.420 --> 36:31.680
Someone else is
responsible for the rest.

36:31.720 --> 36:35.070
Someone has built an empire using
the name "Siravo" as a front.

36:35.110 --> 36:38.400
Yeah, to the tune of 300
million in illicit proceeds.

36:38.710 --> 36:41.980
That guy ever wakes up, he's going
to be in for one hell of a surprise.

36:42.010 --> 36:46.536
Yeah, the best we can figure, Siravo never woke
up from his coma after his motorcycle accident.

36:46.560 --> 36:48.256
Who's keeping him alive?
Who's paying the bills?

36:48.280 --> 36:49.936
Boss, that's what I'm working on here.

36:49.960 --> 36:53.116
Private nursing care, medical
equipment, horse ranch...

36:53.140 --> 36:55.996
Everything was well-funded
until a couple days ago.

36:56.020 --> 37:00.840
When the first account was closed, its contents
were funneled into various offshore accounts.

37:00.870 --> 37:03.370
It's like Perry said,
"Consolidation and liquidation."

37:03.400 --> 37:06.006
Like everyone else involved, ********

37:06.030 --> 37:08.680
All Siravo's accounts have been
drained in the past 24 hours,

37:08.710 --> 37:11.266
but the transfers aren't being
made from outside the banks.

37:11.290 --> 37:15.986
No passwords or serial numbers used, no requests
for thdrawals came via any net portal...

37:16.010 --> 37:18.996
- Someone's stealing the pirate's gold.
- It's not stealing.

37:19.020 --> 37:20.200
Seizing.

37:20.230 --> 37:24.230
Well, there's only a couple agencies
that can do that: Homeland Security and...

37:24.970 --> 37:27.666
- CIA.
- International banking laws.

37:27.690 --> 37:31.270
CIA can seize the assets of any
suspected criminal or terrorist.

37:31.300 --> 37:34.100
Please don't tell me we're
making Trent Kort a very rich man.

37:34.540 --> 37:36.316
- Yeah?
- Um, I need to see you.

37:36.340 --> 37:39.916
All right, Abbs. Be right there.

37:39.940 --> 37:42.390
Find Kort.

37:49.040 --> 37:52.950
Abbs! Abby?

37:58.160 --> 38:00.186
Please, don't fire me, Gibbs.

38:00.210 --> 38:02.880
Or, or send me to jail.

38:04.990 --> 38:09.646
If I have a choice, I'd
rather be fired. I think.

38:09.670 --> 38:11.250
For what?

38:11.280 --> 38:14.010
Aiding and abetting in a homicide.

38:14.430 --> 38:17.106
They played us like a fiddle, Gibbs.

38:17.130 --> 38:19.270
We were... fiddled.

38:19.560 --> 38:21.090
We didn't know what we were saying.

38:21.130 --> 38:25.040
The message went out to Flores,
only it was in an open forum.

38:25.070 --> 38:27.506
So all Rake had to do was monitor it.

38:27.530 --> 38:28.540
The code.

38:28.580 --> 38:30.566
We got it wrong.

38:30.590 --> 38:33.340
Hospital didn't mean "emergency."

38:33.380 --> 38:35.690
It meant "send someone there."

38:35.720 --> 38:38.346
So, as far as Flores goes...

38:38.370 --> 38:40.880
We put out the hit.

38:42.640 --> 38:44.650
Hey, DiNozzo, tell me you got Kort.

38:44.690 --> 38:47.456
Well, didn't get far... less than three
miles... but you're not going to like it.

38:47.480 --> 38:48.906
- Where?
- He just made a call.

38:48.930 --> 38:53.060
Triangulation shows him at the
U.S.Marshal's office at 500 Indiana.

38:53.090 --> 38:55.796
Protection detail's transporting
Perry to the U.S.Attorney's office.

38:55.820 --> 38:58.236
Start the car. Perry's
the last loose end.

38:58.260 --> 39:01.940
- Kort's going to kill Perry?
- No. No, he is not.

39:11.940 --> 39:14.616
- Hello, Gibbs.
- You drained all of his accounts!

39:14.640 --> 39:15.716
Who, Siravo?

39:15.740 --> 39:19.166
There is no Siravo! He's been
out of commission for years!

39:19.190 --> 39:22.120
Eh, someone else must be
running his operations.

39:22.160 --> 39:24.570
Yeah, and you know damn
well who at is, don't you?

39:24.610 --> 39:26.550
There's ju two of us left in this mess.

39:26.590 --> 39:28.266
You listen to me, Kort!

39:28.290 --> 39:30.536
Nobody else dies today!

39:30.560 --> 39:34.210
Never expected you to turn
him over to the marshals.

39:43.510 --> 39:45.780
All right, let's move.

39:47.580 --> 39:50.376
Stow him. Come on, let's go.

39:50.400 --> 39:51.980
Stop.

39:52.470 --> 39:54.270
Trent Kort, CIA.

39:54.310 --> 39:56.806
- The man you're transporting...
- The man is in our protection.

39:56.830 --> 39:59.130
We will use force if you don't stop.

39:59.160 --> 40:00.830
There's been a mistake.

40:00.870 --> 40:03.580
This man cannot be allowed to...

40:08.040 --> 40:10.490
CIA stole my money.

40:12.040 --> 40:15.280
I want it back, Mr. Kort. Every cent.

40:18.700 --> 40:20.810
Give me my money!

40:21.500 --> 40:25.080
You heard him, Kort. Give him his money.

40:25.430 --> 40:28.430
Come on, Perry. You're a numbers guy.

40:30.910 --> 40:33.370
How do you like these odds?

40:41.280 --> 40:44.066
You don't just drop a gun
that's been recently fired.

40:44.090 --> 40:45.580
It could go off.

40:45.610 --> 40:46.876
- You okay?
- Yeah.

40:46.900 --> 40:49.280
You really are a madman.

40:49.940 --> 40:52.006
You knew it was Perry?

40:52.030 --> 40:54.460
Well, I knew it wasn't me.

40:57.750 --> 40:59.780
So Perry was Siravo's accountant.

40:59.820 --> 41:02.646
Set up his living will after
the motorcycle accident.

41:02.670 --> 41:06.086
Used power of attorney to access his
holdings, and began building his network.

41:06.110 --> 41:10.646
All the while, the public face of the
criminal empire would never be seen anywhere

41:10.670 --> 41:13.320
but here, on The Wall.

41:18.570 --> 41:21.120
You're the real victim
here, aren't you, Wall?

41:22.300 --> 41:25.146
You weren't after the pirate.
You were after his treasure.

41:25.170 --> 41:28.050
Found his phony health
fund and cleared it out.

41:28.090 --> 41:30.776
I didn't know he would
take it so personally,

41:30.800 --> 41:34.120
but it seemed like an opportune
time to cash in a favor.

41:34.160 --> 41:36.470
$300 million, I'd say
you got your mey's worth.

41:36.520 --> 41:38.100
CIA keeps it.

41:38.130 --> 41:40.610
And you get Siravo as promised.

41:40.640 --> 41:43.810
A major threat has been neutralized.

41:46.910 --> 41:49.390
You thought I was going to shoot him?

41:50.090 --> 41:52.880
Just there to get him back, that's all.

41:53.140 --> 41:56.566
Couldn't have him hide
behind immunity now, could we?

41:56.590 --> 41:59.160
Bank robberies from bad guys.

41:59.710 --> 42:03.040
Is that how the CIA
finances their operations?

42:04.080 --> 42:06.836
I'm just trying to get
back in the starting lineup.

42:06.860 --> 42:10.520
It's possible you're even
more dangerous behind a desk.

42:17.960 --> 42:21.176
Makes you feel any better,
Gibbs, I owe you one.

42:21.200 --> 42:24.000
No. We're even.

42:28.410 --> 42:30.886
You know, the hardest
part about coaching?

42:30.910 --> 42:33.310
It's watching from the sidelines.

42:33.350 --> 42:35.950
Yeah, it looks a little different
from over there, doesn't it, on?

42:37.960 --> 42:41.476
What? You would have
done things differently?

42:41.500 --> 42:44.510
I would. I do.

42:47.660 --> 42:52.690
But in the last two minutes, you got
to let your quarterback call the plays.

42:52.970 --> 42:54.790
Nice win.
