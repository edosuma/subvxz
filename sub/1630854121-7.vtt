00:01.560 --> 00:02.743
<i> -Previously on</i> The Resident...
-Governor Betz has got to be

00:02.745 --> 00:04.061
feeling the pressure
to meet with you.

00:04.171 --> 00:06.563
-So far, no word.
-You're really worried
about this.

00:06.565 --> 00:08.248
<i> -You talked to your sister?</i>
<i> -You're worried?</i>

00:08.250 --> 00:10.175
<i> -A little.</i>
<i>-She wanted this. She chose it.</i>

00:10.177 --> 00:12.511
Did she understand
what she was choosing?

00:12.513 --> 00:15.681
(applause)

00:15.683 --> 00:17.165
-Want to dance?
-Yeah.

00:17.167 --> 00:18.183
<i> I'm grateful</i>

00:18.185 --> 00:20.777
you're always there
for both of us.

00:20.779 --> 00:21.603
I love you guys.

00:23.932 --> 00:25.357
<i> CAROL:</i>
<i>Come and meet my hospice nurse.</i>

00:25.359 --> 00:26.266
This is Janaya.

00:26.510 --> 00:28.252
She takes care
of dying folk like me.

00:28.254 --> 00:29.862
I'm not just here
for your mother.

00:29.864 --> 00:30.988
I'm here for you, too.

00:37.204 --> 00:40.873
Which do you think is better--
side-by-side stroller

00:41.100 --> 00:43.358
or front-to-back
Splash Mountain style?

00:43.377 --> 00:46.361
Side-to-side doesn't come
in fire engine red,

00:46.455 --> 00:48.789
and I'm not about to be
strolling through Piedmont Park

00:48.883 --> 00:50.382
in pumpkin spice orange.

00:50.609 --> 00:53.293
Is the stroller for you,
or is it for the twins?

00:53.370 --> 00:58.039
Hey, if I'm spending what I'm
spending on a glorified wagon,

00:58.059 --> 01:00.450
don't I deserve the color
of my choosing?

01:00.452 --> 01:02.227
(both laugh)

01:02.379 --> 01:04.805
Ah.

01:04.899 --> 01:07.808
This next chapter looks good
on you, AJ.

01:07.960 --> 01:09.960
Thank you, my brother.

01:10.053 --> 01:12.979
And what about
your next chapter?

01:13.132 --> 01:14.965
What's the status
with you and Cade?

01:14.983 --> 01:16.800
We're having fun.

01:16.819 --> 01:19.995
She's... really great.

01:20.748 --> 01:24.065
Hmm. You know, it's funny.

01:24.234 --> 01:27.503
I thought you and Billie
would end up together.

01:28.572 --> 01:30.147
But I adjusted

01:30.240 --> 01:32.240
and I told myself I was wrong.

01:32.334 --> 01:37.054
But then I saw you and Billie
dancing at the wedding.

01:37.673 --> 01:39.932
(laughs)

01:40.159 --> 01:42.083
Cade wanted
to be at the wedding.

01:42.103 --> 01:44.603
-She just had to work.
-Ah.

01:44.830 --> 01:48.065
Yeah, that explains everything.

01:55.174 --> 01:57.174
I've practiced medicine
in many places,

01:57.192 --> 01:59.118
but never in a place like this.

01:59.269 --> 02:01.620
Closest I got was residency.

02:01.771 --> 02:04.698
Our ER had a jail ward.

02:04.850 --> 02:07.684
Challenging, pretty rewarding.

02:07.686 --> 02:09.628
Hey.

02:09.855 --> 02:11.630
Janaya.

02:11.857 --> 02:13.948
-Hey.
-(Janaya laughs)

02:13.968 --> 02:16.135
-Hey.
-Oh.

02:16.286 --> 02:18.303
Thank you so much
for agreeing to see Bobby.

02:18.530 --> 02:20.305
You have no idea
how much this means to me.

02:20.532 --> 02:22.699
They aren't taking
his symptoms seriously,

02:22.868 --> 02:24.368
and I had nowhere else to turn.

02:24.386 --> 02:26.887
Well, prison clinics are
notoriously short-staffed,

02:27.039 --> 02:28.963
and sadly,
the people they house--

02:28.983 --> 02:30.891
they aren't top priority.

02:31.043 --> 02:32.542
What kind of symptoms
is he having?

02:32.711 --> 02:34.711
Well, he was in terrible pain
during visiting hours.

02:34.730 --> 02:37.564
They won't let me examine him,
so I don't know what's going on.

02:37.658 --> 02:38.824
How come they won't let you

02:38.975 --> 02:40.884
-help your own brother?
-Only outside

02:40.903 --> 02:43.478
specialists like you guys
are allowed to.

02:43.497 --> 02:46.740
And just so you know,
Bobby was convicted

02:46.892 --> 02:48.167
of something that he didn't do.

02:48.318 --> 02:50.836
Now he's alone on death row.

02:51.005 --> 02:53.505
He doesn't deserve this.

02:53.732 --> 02:55.065
Yeah. We will make sure

02:55.083 --> 02:58.218
that Bobby gets the care
he needs, right?

02:59.329 --> 03:01.571
We're gonna figure out
what's going on.

03:01.590 --> 03:03.265
Thank you.

03:09.915 --> 03:12.082
Once they're asleep,
go for a walk

03:12.100 --> 03:14.860
or take that yoga class
in the park.

03:15.011 --> 03:17.437
I know, Padma,
but that's why AJ hired Serena,

03:17.589 --> 03:19.347
so you can have time
for yourself.

03:19.366 --> 03:21.867
All right, okay.
I'll talk to you later. Bye.

03:22.094 --> 03:23.610
Still doesn't want to let them
out of her sight?

03:23.762 --> 03:24.928
Apparently not.

03:24.947 --> 03:26.371
Doesn't she trust
the new babysitter?

03:26.523 --> 03:27.539
No, it's more than that.

03:27.766 --> 03:29.708
She can't relax with them
or without them.

03:29.859 --> 03:31.935
I wish she wasn't so alone.

03:32.028 --> 03:33.937
AJ's been amazing,
but at the end of the day

03:34.030 --> 03:35.530
they're not a couple, you know?

03:35.549 --> 03:36.790
Look, Padma is strong.

03:36.959 --> 03:38.291
Having two kids is a lot.

03:38.444 --> 03:40.034
She just needs some time.
She's going to be okay.

03:40.054 --> 03:41.962
-I know, let's hope.
-All right?

03:42.114 --> 03:44.948
Everyone looks amazing. (sighs)

03:44.967 --> 03:46.225
Such a beautiful wedding.

03:46.376 --> 03:48.376
Not gonna lie,
you really missed out.

03:48.395 --> 03:49.895
Who's that?

03:50.122 --> 03:51.805
That is Bell's stepson Jake.

03:51.899 --> 03:53.232
He's awesome.

03:53.459 --> 03:55.308
He's a plastic surgeon,
has an amazing voice.

03:55.402 --> 03:58.812
He asked me to accompany him,
but, uh,

03:58.888 --> 04:00.130
I just didn't feel like it.

04:00.299 --> 04:01.907
-Right.
-No, I didn't.

04:02.058 --> 04:05.059
(laughs)
Aw, look at their dresses.

04:05.153 --> 04:07.137
They're so adorable.

04:07.155 --> 04:09.063
IRVING:
Mm-hmm.

04:09.083 --> 04:11.899
That is not what it looks like.

04:12.068 --> 04:13.827
Everyone was dancing together.

04:13.963 --> 04:15.996
Hell, I also danced with Conrad.

04:16.757 --> 04:19.383
And he looked at you like that?

04:20.410 --> 04:22.261
Mm-hmm.

04:27.676 --> 04:29.993
(typing)

04:30.012 --> 04:31.085
(lock buzzes)

04:31.179 --> 04:33.013
I've known Bobby for ten years.

04:33.165 --> 04:35.665
He's one of my favorites.

04:35.684 --> 04:37.183
We play hoops, lift weights.

04:37.352 --> 04:39.503
He's always asking me
about my kids,

04:39.521 --> 04:41.688
telling me the crazy things
he learns about

04:41.840 --> 04:43.340
in those books he reads.

04:43.358 --> 04:45.175
But he also killed a woman
for her wallet.

04:45.193 --> 04:47.677
Smashed her with a brick
until her brain exploded.

04:47.771 --> 04:50.271
Everyone in here deserves
decent medical care.

04:50.365 --> 04:53.083
So do your best in ten minutes.

04:59.282 --> 05:02.259
Hey, Bobby,
you've got visitors.

05:03.545 --> 05:07.973
I'm Dr. Austin,
and this here is Dr. Hawkins.

05:08.792 --> 05:10.291
We're here to examine you.

05:10.311 --> 05:12.978
I've examined him,
I know what's wrong.

05:13.129 --> 05:16.398
He's got a case
of "desperate for a field trip."

05:17.967 --> 05:21.611
Janaya asked us to see you.

05:23.065 --> 05:25.215
AUSTIN:
Hey, man, your sister

05:25.233 --> 05:28.643
was my rock
when my mother was dying.

05:28.662 --> 05:30.829
She was our hospice nurse.

05:30.998 --> 05:32.980
And I'm telling you,
I don't know

05:33.075 --> 05:35.334
how I would have managed
without her.

05:36.244 --> 05:38.653
(with hoarse, raspy voice):
You and me both.

05:38.672 --> 05:40.564
(panting)

05:40.582 --> 05:44.325
She's taken care of me
my entire life.

05:44.345 --> 05:47.012
Now she's stuck
visiting me here.

05:47.089 --> 05:49.497
(labored breathing)

05:49.516 --> 05:52.409
People cut her when they hear
her brother's a killer.

05:53.503 --> 05:56.855
Her reward for being the only
one left who believes in me.

05:57.082 --> 05:59.149
(groans, yells)

05:59.843 --> 06:01.084
What the...?

06:01.103 --> 06:02.861
Grand mal seizure.

06:03.012 --> 06:04.921
Protect his airway.
Protect his airway.

06:05.014 --> 06:07.574
You, call 911, now!

06:10.537 --> 06:12.445
(high-pitched gasping)

06:12.598 --> 06:14.539
♪ ♪

06:36.212 --> 06:39.046
I want to believe Governor Betz
called this private meeting

06:39.066 --> 06:40.565
because he's ready to listen.

06:40.792 --> 06:44.218
What he's thinking about is his
rich donors who want a tax cut.

06:44.312 --> 06:48.240
Randolph, we're not gonna get
anywhere by attacking him.

06:48.391 --> 06:51.818
-He holds the power
over Chastain's future.
-Okay.

06:51.970 --> 06:54.246
If we do this right,
we enter as enemies

06:54.397 --> 06:56.990
and leave with the governor
on our side.

06:57.142 --> 06:59.142
-Let me do the talking.
-Okay.

06:59.235 --> 07:01.402
All you see here is
the CEO's arm candy.

07:01.496 --> 07:03.422
(Kit laughs)

07:06.927 --> 07:08.910
The intense pain comes and goes.

07:08.929 --> 07:11.078
-(gasps)
-So you're on vacation?

07:11.173 --> 07:12.839
The trip of a lifetime.

07:12.933 --> 07:14.157
We saved our money for ages

07:14.217 --> 07:15.508
so we could take a year off
from the Tate.

07:15.602 --> 07:17.677
-That's where we work.
-And travel the world.

07:17.829 --> 07:19.287
Camping out, cheap hostels,

07:19.347 --> 07:21.498
-railway passes
made it all possible.
-Yeah.

07:21.516 --> 07:23.275
So when did
your stomach start hurting?

07:23.426 --> 07:26.503
It was about two weeks ago?
Yeah?

07:26.505 --> 07:29.522
Ibuprofen did the trick
for a bit, till it didn't.

07:29.675 --> 07:31.766
So your blood pressure
is slightly low,

07:31.785 --> 07:33.100
and your heart rate is high.

07:33.120 --> 07:35.454
Why haven't you seen a doctor?

07:35.605 --> 07:37.581
(both laugh)

07:38.608 --> 07:39.866
In this country?

07:40.018 --> 07:42.368
(laughs)
Yeah, we can't afford it.

07:42.521 --> 07:45.112
I only came now
'cause I thought I was dying.

07:45.132 --> 07:47.223
We wanted to wait
until we got home to the NHS--

07:47.225 --> 07:50.618
our National Health Service,
which is entirely free.

07:50.637 --> 07:53.138
You know, we complain about
waiting a bit in England,

07:53.365 --> 07:56.123
but if we had to pay
actual money to see a doctor,

07:56.143 --> 07:57.792
there'd be bodies
in the streets.

07:57.811 --> 07:58.977
Corpses in the canals.

07:59.128 --> 08:00.870
Cadavers in the...

08:00.964 --> 08:02.647
Um, castles?

08:02.799 --> 08:04.390
(laughs)

08:04.485 --> 08:06.543
(yells)

08:06.561 --> 08:07.969
It bloody kills!

08:08.063 --> 08:11.823
(panting, groaning)

08:12.050 --> 08:15.327
(sirens blaring)

08:16.722 --> 08:19.039
(tires squealing)

08:30.569 --> 08:32.118
(groaning)

08:32.179 --> 08:34.587
-Wh-Where am I?
-CONRAD: Bobby,

08:34.740 --> 08:35.997
you passed out at the prison.

08:36.016 --> 08:37.832
You're at Chastain Park
Memorial Hospital,

08:37.851 --> 08:41.019
and we're going to take care
of you here, all right?

08:42.247 --> 08:44.005
-Bay 12.
-Bobby Purcell.

08:44.024 --> 08:45.357
He's an inmate
at the Georgia State Prison.

08:45.508 --> 08:47.934
He's presenting
with acute onset hemiplegia

08:48.028 --> 08:50.195
after having a seizure.

08:50.864 --> 08:52.555
His sats and BP are low.

08:52.557 --> 08:56.776
-He aspirated, as well.
-Let's load him with AEDs.

08:56.945 --> 08:58.703
You go ahead.

08:58.872 --> 09:00.580
I paged Billie
for a code stroke.

09:03.268 --> 09:04.876
-What do you need?
-I'm concerned about stroke,

09:05.028 --> 09:06.619
seizure
and aspiration pneumonitis.

09:06.772 --> 09:08.104
BILLIE:
And time of symptoms onset?

09:08.197 --> 09:10.865
-Uh, 30 minutes.
-He's still in the window
for TPA.

09:10.959 --> 09:13.385
-Page me when you get a head CT.
-Okay.

09:17.040 --> 09:19.373
His sats are improving.

09:19.467 --> 09:23.044
Yeah, looks like we can hold
on intubation for now.

09:23.212 --> 09:25.789
Let's order a full panel
and a tox screen

09:25.807 --> 09:27.957
so we can figure out
exactly what's going on.

09:28.051 --> 09:30.217
Push, push, push. Good.

09:30.312 --> 09:32.312
-Janaya.
-Bobby, hold on. I'm here.

09:32.406 --> 09:34.573
-Squeeze, squeeze, squeeze,
squeeze, squeeze.
-How is he?

09:34.724 --> 09:36.074
Better but still unstable.

09:36.301 --> 09:38.351
-Let-let me know what I can do.
-Yeah. We'll come get you

09:38.503 --> 09:40.245
-after we get a head CT, okay?
-AUSTIN: Hey.

09:40.396 --> 09:43.373
Let's get you settled
in the waiting room, all right?

09:49.331 --> 09:51.238
BELL:
You couldn't be more prepared
if you tried.

09:51.333 --> 09:53.666
There's so much riding on this.

09:53.760 --> 09:55.594
If Betz slashes our budget,

09:55.745 --> 09:57.429
-we'll be a third-rate hospital.
-Right this way.

09:57.656 --> 10:00.340
All the hard work we've done to
make Chastain a great facility

10:00.434 --> 10:02.325
that serves rich and poor alike
will be gone.

10:02.418 --> 10:04.677
Kit, you got this.
It's a one-on-one. It's private.

10:04.771 --> 10:07.680
It's low pressure.
It's a perfect scenario for you.

10:07.833 --> 10:09.423
From your lips.

10:09.501 --> 10:11.610
-Dr. Voss!
-Dr. Voss!
-Dr. Voss!

10:11.761 --> 10:13.519
-MAN: Dr. Voss, over here!
-MAN 2: Excuse me, Dr. Voss!

10:13.672 --> 10:15.930
WOMAN:
If we could just ask
a brief question, Doctor...

10:15.949 --> 10:17.115
MAN 3:
Anything to add, Governor?

10:17.266 --> 10:19.451
-MAN 4: Dr. Voss!
-WOMAN 2: Excuse me, Kit.

10:19.602 --> 10:22.662
(overlapping chatter)

10:25.867 --> 10:28.609
Dr. Voss, welcome.

10:29.445 --> 10:32.113
Thank you. I thought
this was a private meeting,

10:32.132 --> 10:33.965
-not a media event.
-Oh.

10:34.192 --> 10:35.783
I think it's good
to pull the curtain back

10:35.877 --> 10:38.044
for the people of Georgia,
don't you?

10:38.196 --> 10:39.471
And you are?

10:39.622 --> 10:41.197
Randolph Bell,
a surgeon at Chastain.

10:41.290 --> 10:43.700
One of our finest
and a former CEO.

10:43.718 --> 10:46.035
Here to give you more
information about the effect

10:46.204 --> 10:48.037
of budget cuts
on our surgical floor.

10:48.131 --> 10:50.297
Well, I'm glad
you could join us, Dr. Bell.

10:50.317 --> 10:52.800
-(camera shutters clicking)
-Here. Help yourselves.

10:52.894 --> 10:54.319
There's coffee and tea.

10:54.470 --> 10:56.045
I got rid
of the espresso machine.

10:56.064 --> 10:57.730
(laughs)
It's not really my style.

10:57.883 --> 11:00.075
Well, I'm sure
we'll muddle through.

11:07.000 --> 11:08.667
How's the pain now, Claire?

11:08.818 --> 11:12.245
(sighs)
The pain comes and goes.

11:12.397 --> 11:13.897
Maybe it was just a cramp.

11:13.990 --> 11:17.158
Ah. Kidney stones, actually.

11:17.326 --> 11:19.419
They're some of the most painful
little things in the world.

11:19.513 --> 11:21.921
But why aren't
the pain meds working?

11:22.073 --> 11:23.831
The stones have become
too large,

11:23.850 --> 11:25.408
and they're stuck
in the ureter.

11:25.427 --> 11:28.411
And if we do not get rid of
them, you will feel a lot worse.

11:28.504 --> 11:29.354
LEELA:
Hello.

11:29.431 --> 11:31.764
Um, this is my colleague
Dr. Devi,

11:31.858 --> 11:33.858
and I have discussed your case
with her.

11:34.085 --> 11:38.271
Oh, I'm so sorry
you're going through this.

11:38.423 --> 11:39.422
We are going to have to do

11:39.441 --> 11:41.015
a procedure
to break up the stones

11:41.034 --> 11:42.759
to make them easier to pass.

11:42.852 --> 11:44.594
-Procedure?
-It's noninvasive.

11:44.612 --> 11:46.112
You'll be out of here
shortly afterwards.

11:46.264 --> 11:47.706
It'll still cost
an arm and a leg.

11:47.933 --> 11:49.449
I'll wait till England.

11:49.601 --> 11:52.711
Listen, it is dangerous to fly
with kidney stones this large.

11:52.862 --> 11:54.195
You could have an attack,

11:54.289 --> 11:56.297
and they'd have
to divert the flight.

11:57.366 --> 11:59.943
Claire, you're suffering.

11:59.961 --> 12:03.629
Whatever the cost,
we'll deal, yeah?

12:03.782 --> 12:05.949
Even if it means
selling the car.

12:06.042 --> 12:09.644
I think
we'll be selling the flat.

12:20.465 --> 12:21.981
Baby brother.

12:22.133 --> 12:24.576
-Janaya.
-Are you okay?

12:24.727 --> 12:26.819
Oh, I was so worried.

12:26.896 --> 12:29.897
It was touch and go,
but these docs kept me kicking,

12:29.916 --> 12:32.008
much to Leo's dismay.

12:32.010 --> 12:34.310
-Glad you're okay, Bobby.
-Well,

12:34.479 --> 12:36.312
-what do you think happened?
-BILLIE: His head CT

12:36.331 --> 12:38.815
is negative for hemorrhage.
Start him on TPA?

12:38.833 --> 12:41.484
I suspect you suffered
a transient ischemic attack.

12:41.503 --> 12:43.336
What is that?

12:43.488 --> 12:45.488
That's when parts of your brain
don't get enough blood.

12:45.490 --> 12:47.432
CADE:
Right, it's usually temporary
and resolves

12:47.659 --> 12:49.826
on its own, which is why you're
getting your strength back.

12:49.919 --> 12:51.418
-CONRAD: But why did it happen?
-Mm.

12:51.480 --> 12:53.605
That's the question
we're facing.

12:53.832 --> 12:55.607
Bobby had leukemia as a child.

12:55.834 --> 12:57.424
Our mom was always working.

12:57.519 --> 13:00.779
Janaya saw me through it,
cared for me,

13:00.930 --> 13:04.340
even though
we were both just kids.

13:04.433 --> 13:07.693
It was so long ago, but could
the leukemia be related?

13:07.788 --> 13:11.697
We'll look into it. I want
to check your neck, all right?

13:11.850 --> 13:14.292
It's all yours.

13:14.443 --> 13:16.044
(grunts)

13:23.695 --> 13:26.137
I hear a right-sided bruit.

13:26.289 --> 13:29.048
Oh. That's when
there's some kind of obstruction

13:29.142 --> 13:30.291
inside the artery in your neck.

13:30.310 --> 13:31.810
BILLIE:
Could be high-grade stenosis?

13:31.961 --> 13:33.386
But that wouldn't
cause headaches.

13:33.538 --> 13:35.629
It may be responsible
for the TIA.

13:35.649 --> 13:38.191
Let's get an MRI and find out.

13:41.137 --> 13:43.137
Governor, I know
you and I are both committed

13:43.156 --> 13:44.805
to the same thing--

13:44.899 --> 13:46.065
the well-being
of the people of Georgia.

13:46.217 --> 13:49.010
But can I just say
I love your accent?

13:49.070 --> 13:51.571
(laughs)
Is that inappropriate?

13:51.723 --> 13:54.724
Where are you from?
I'm Georgia born and bred.

13:54.726 --> 13:57.335
KIT:
I've lived in Atlanta
for 40 years.

13:57.562 --> 14:00.154
I care about the people here
as much as anyone.

14:00.323 --> 14:02.748
I'm certain
a conscientious person

14:02.843 --> 14:04.658
like yourself wants
to understand

14:04.678 --> 14:08.012
the effect your budget cuts
will have on our patients.

14:08.239 --> 14:10.331
Yeah, sometimes
we all need tough love.

14:10.350 --> 14:13.076
I-I campaigned on lower taxes.

14:13.094 --> 14:16.354
Chastain Park has got
to operate within its budget,

14:16.581 --> 14:18.247
without help
from public funding.

14:18.341 --> 14:21.008
But, Governor Betz,
we are a public hospital,

14:21.027 --> 14:23.419
which means
we require public funding,

14:23.438 --> 14:27.090
something Governor Randall
understood when she instituted

14:27.183 --> 14:29.108
a sales tax
to help cover our expenses.

14:29.260 --> 14:31.611
Well, that sales tax
must now foot the bill

14:31.763 --> 14:32.945
for more pressing issues.

14:33.098 --> 14:37.358
-More pressing than health care?
-Crime.

14:37.452 --> 14:38.784
Crime is soaring.

14:38.937 --> 14:42.397
We need more cops on the streets
to ensure law and order.

14:42.399 --> 14:43.697
Well, you know, you're talking

14:43.717 --> 14:46.700
about taking away
hundreds of millions of dollars

14:46.720 --> 14:47.886
being used to save lives.

14:48.037 --> 14:49.536
There's no way
Chastain will be able

14:49.556 --> 14:51.538
to provide
the most basic level of care.

14:51.558 --> 14:54.300
Well, for basic care,
you bill Medicare and Medicaid.

14:54.394 --> 14:55.952
I bet you know all about that.

14:56.045 --> 14:57.954
Well, maybe not as much
as you do.

14:58.047 --> 14:59.472
I mean, you made your fortune
running one

14:59.566 --> 15:01.566
of the largest hospital groups
in the country.

15:01.735 --> 15:03.735
Yes, and we maximized profits

15:03.962 --> 15:05.236
without sacrificing
patient care.

15:05.388 --> 15:07.480
Is that what you call
Medicare fraud these days?

15:07.574 --> 15:11.000
You billed for home health care
visits that never happened.

15:11.002 --> 15:12.393
You subjected patients
to dangerous

15:12.412 --> 15:15.488
and invasive procedures
they didn't remotely need,

15:15.640 --> 15:18.307
overdosed people on chemo.
Medicare paid for all...

15:18.326 --> 15:20.993
Just remind me, how much did you
scam the taxpayers for?

15:21.087 --> 15:22.812
Wait. I remember.

15:22.830 --> 15:26.816
-$1 billion.
-Lies. It's all lies.

15:26.834 --> 15:28.575
All right, we're done here.

15:28.595 --> 15:29.743
But it's in the public record
and deserves more attention.

15:29.763 --> 15:31.988
All right, turn the cameras off.

15:32.006 --> 15:34.323
No, in fact, your hospitals
committed the biggest

15:34.325 --> 15:35.658
Medicare fraud in history.

15:35.751 --> 15:37.343
They got caught
and had to pay a huge fine

15:37.495 --> 15:40.680
while you walked away
with a $300 million parachute

15:40.832 --> 15:44.016
that you used to finance
your campaign for governor.

15:44.169 --> 15:47.170
MAN:
Governor, what do you have
to say about these allegations?

15:47.188 --> 15:48.854
I don't have
to put up with this.

15:49.007 --> 15:50.189
(reporters clamoring)

15:50.341 --> 15:53.451
But we're pulling back
the curtain, right?

15:54.846 --> 15:56.696
(sighs)
That went well.

15:56.848 --> 15:59.682
That had to happen. Right?

15:59.684 --> 16:02.293
-Yeah.
-(sighs)

16:05.966 --> 16:08.633
Find me every ounce of dirt
on that Dr. Bell.

16:08.860 --> 16:10.593
I'm gonna destroy him.

16:14.199 --> 16:15.698
CONRAD:
It's just hard to imagine

16:15.717 --> 16:16.808
he committed this kind of crime,

16:17.811 --> 16:23.222
but his DNA was all over
the scene and murder weapon.

16:23.374 --> 16:26.967
It's not always easy to know
what people are really like.

16:27.061 --> 16:29.988
What's that supposed to mean?

16:30.215 --> 16:33.116
I saw Irving's photos
from the wedding.

16:35.328 --> 16:37.720
And?

16:37.813 --> 16:39.831
There's one of you

16:39.982 --> 16:43.501
slow-dancing with Billie.

16:44.337 --> 16:47.338
And the look on your face was...

16:48.733 --> 16:51.400
It feels like
there's something between you.

16:51.419 --> 16:55.496
We're friends, good friends.

16:55.573 --> 16:57.682
Is that all?

16:58.743 --> 17:02.103
We share something that's...

17:02.930 --> 17:05.414
It's-it's hard to describe.

17:05.508 --> 17:07.600
I guess...

17:07.694 --> 17:10.436
it's a sense of what we lost.

17:10.605 --> 17:13.422
That's it?

17:13.557 --> 17:14.924
Yes.

17:14.926 --> 17:17.684
Truth is important to me.

17:17.779 --> 17:20.038
(door opens)

17:22.542 --> 17:24.283
Bobby's labs came back.

17:24.435 --> 17:26.693
There's nothing remarkable.

17:26.713 --> 17:29.464
Well, maybe
we'll find some answers here.

17:30.533 --> 17:32.275
(Cade sighs)

17:33.111 --> 17:36.036
-Wow.
-BILLIE: Looks like a mass

17:36.056 --> 17:38.723
traveling along his carotids
into the skull base.

17:38.950 --> 17:40.058
CADE:
A carotid body tumor.

17:40.209 --> 17:42.785
I've never seen one
this extensive.

17:42.804 --> 17:43.895
It's spread to his lymph nodes.

17:44.122 --> 17:45.137
CONRAD:
They're usually detected

17:45.290 --> 17:47.381
early when people get
the proper care,

17:47.475 --> 17:51.736
but now it's compressing
his vessels and cranial nerves.

17:51.963 --> 17:53.629
That explains the TIA,
aspiration,

17:53.648 --> 17:56.074
difficulty swallowing,
even his hoarse voice.

17:56.301 --> 17:58.484
This would be an extremely
complicated resection.

17:58.636 --> 18:02.229
The tumor is entangled with his
internal and external jugulars.

18:02.323 --> 18:03.730
We'll have to talk to AJ,

18:03.825 --> 18:05.157
but surgery could cause
irreparable disability,

18:05.310 --> 18:06.775
-even death.
-CONRAD: We haven't even talked

18:06.828 --> 18:10.254
about his execution
being scheduled for next year.

18:10.406 --> 18:12.573
(sighs)
Does it make sense

18:12.667 --> 18:14.500
to put him through something
this dangerous

18:14.652 --> 18:16.152
and invasive right now?

18:16.170 --> 18:19.430
He'll likely die before the
year is out without the surgery.

18:19.582 --> 18:21.841
But recovery is long
and difficult

18:21.993 --> 18:23.434
with months
of chemo and radiation.

18:23.603 --> 18:25.085
It could ruin
the time he has left.

18:25.105 --> 18:28.848
Surgery gives Bobby a chance
at a better life,

18:29.000 --> 18:31.109
no matter how long.

18:31.260 --> 18:34.278
Well, it's his choice to make.

18:34.430 --> 18:36.989
Isn't it?

19:04.960 --> 19:08.128
Thank you for meeting me,
Donald, on such short notice.

19:08.222 --> 19:11.557
Yeah, sure. What can I do
for you, Governor?

19:11.709 --> 19:14.059
Well, Jerrod mentioned
we need some help.

19:14.212 --> 19:18.072
And you are in a
perfect position to provide it.

19:18.807 --> 19:21.217
I don't follow.

19:21.235 --> 19:22.809
How long have you worked
at Chastain?

19:22.829 --> 19:24.553
Not long.
Uh, this is my second week.

19:24.555 --> 19:27.556
And have you had a chance to
work with Dr. Randolph Bell yet?

19:27.575 --> 19:29.575
No. I-I hope to.

19:29.669 --> 19:32.795
So, let's make that happen.

19:34.340 --> 19:36.248
Does this have anything to do
with what happened this morning?

19:36.401 --> 19:39.844
-'Cause I saw the video...
-Well, let's just say

19:39.995 --> 19:41.179
that there have been
some concerning reports

19:41.406 --> 19:43.406
which put Dr. Bell's competency
in doubt.

19:43.424 --> 19:45.499
Now, I'm sure, as a scrub tech,

19:45.593 --> 19:47.259
patient safety is
your first priority.

19:47.412 --> 19:51.247
I've only heard good things
about Dr. Bell.

19:51.265 --> 19:53.340
I wish I could say the same
about you, Donald.

19:53.434 --> 19:57.010
Jerrod filled me in on what
happened at Yates University.

19:57.104 --> 20:02.158
How he helped that little mess
of yours go away.

20:04.445 --> 20:06.454
For now.

20:10.210 --> 20:12.084
What is it you need?

20:14.714 --> 20:17.289
<i> BELL:</i>
<i> They got caught</i>
<i> and had to pay a huge fine</i>

20:17.383 --> 20:21.293
<i>while you just walked away with</i>
<i>a $300 million golden parachute</i>

20:21.387 --> 20:23.870
<i> that you used to finance</i>
<i> your campaign for governor.</i>

20:23.890 --> 20:26.390
Any calls or emails?

20:26.542 --> 20:28.709
Letters laced with anthrax?
Not yet.

20:28.728 --> 20:31.136
Dare we hope something good came
of that rant?

20:31.231 --> 20:33.564
At least the problem's
in the public eye now.

20:33.791 --> 20:36.049
Maybe Governor Betz
will feel the pressure.

20:36.143 --> 20:37.460
No, you had him.

20:37.478 --> 20:40.646
I just charged in there,
I'm sorry.

20:40.798 --> 20:42.147
Couldn't stop myself.

20:42.242 --> 20:43.816
You spoke from the heart.

20:43.968 --> 20:45.818
There was never any chance

20:45.970 --> 20:47.411
of winning the governor
to our side.

20:47.488 --> 20:49.396
He brought me there
to humiliate me.

20:49.474 --> 20:51.231
I'm proud you stood up to him.

20:51.251 --> 20:53.233
And a little scared
of what may come at us next.

20:53.327 --> 20:55.753
-Yeah, I really put my foot
in it.
-All right, Attila.

20:55.922 --> 20:58.071
Don't you have an army
of kidney stones to conquer?

20:58.165 --> 21:01.175
Yeah, I think
I can probably get that right.

21:01.928 --> 21:04.653
Dr. Bell? Sorry to bother.

21:04.747 --> 21:06.580
Uh, I'm the new scrub tech.
I just wanted to say

21:06.674 --> 21:08.582
I look forward
to working with you in the OR.

21:08.676 --> 21:10.676
-Great. What's your name?
-Uh, Donald Killian?

21:10.828 --> 21:13.688
I look forward to working
with you also, Donald.

21:24.617 --> 21:26.842
This is quite comfy.

21:26.935 --> 21:30.771
It feels like I ended up in
some weird science experiment.

21:30.790 --> 21:32.531
So there you see
the kidney stones.

21:32.683 --> 21:35.126
And we position
the head of this machine

21:35.353 --> 21:38.111
so that the crosshairs
are right above the stones.

21:38.131 --> 21:39.964
How does it work?

21:40.191 --> 21:41.524
DEVON:
Well, shock waves-- they move

21:41.542 --> 21:44.135
through the water, and
they break up the kidney stones.

21:44.211 --> 21:46.879
2,000 shock waves, each
a fraction of a second long.

21:47.031 --> 21:48.197
Shattering them into fragments,

21:48.215 --> 21:49.640
which will then pass
on their own.

21:49.867 --> 21:52.217
Ah, the NHS might be free,

21:52.312 --> 21:55.037
but these American gizmos

21:55.130 --> 21:56.981
might be worth the price
of admission.

21:57.132 --> 21:59.041
Well, spending big on technology

21:59.134 --> 22:01.694
does have
the occasional benefit.

22:06.067 --> 22:09.476
JANAYA:
Our uncle died
of something similar.

22:09.495 --> 22:11.311
Bobby, I'm so sorry.

22:11.331 --> 22:13.331
I should have caught this.

22:13.482 --> 22:15.224
Carotid body tumors
are very rare.

22:15.242 --> 22:17.743
And Bobby had a constellation
of symptoms.

22:17.912 --> 22:20.338
BOBBY:
This isn't on you.

22:21.248 --> 22:22.748
How long do I have?

22:23.734 --> 22:26.844
Given where the cancer
has spread, a few months

22:26.995 --> 22:29.513
if left untreated.

22:29.665 --> 22:31.665
Surgery and chemo
could buy you some time,

22:31.684 --> 22:33.667
but it's complicated.

22:33.686 --> 22:36.312
Side effects, huge risks.

22:39.266 --> 22:41.917
I appreciate the efforts

22:42.010 --> 22:43.919
and care.

22:44.012 --> 22:46.739
It means a lot to me.

22:47.942 --> 22:50.092
But I'm done here.

22:50.185 --> 22:52.536
Don't say that.

22:53.431 --> 22:56.022
I live alone in a cage
for a crime I didn't commit.

22:56.042 --> 22:58.934
We're gonna keep fighting
to prove your innocence.

22:58.953 --> 23:02.454
I gave up on that long ago.

23:02.548 --> 23:05.457
Now we move on.

23:05.610 --> 23:07.176
Both of us.

23:08.613 --> 23:10.129
I won't suffer anymore,

23:10.281 --> 23:13.057
and you'll be free
of the brother who shamed you.

23:13.208 --> 23:16.376
I have never been ashamed
of you.

23:17.138 --> 23:19.880
This is a blessing
and a relief in some ways.

23:19.899 --> 23:24.735
Ending it all soon
is a welcome way out.

23:33.746 --> 23:36.639
I am so sorry.

23:36.657 --> 23:38.157
He didn't kill her.

23:38.309 --> 23:42.327
-The DNA evidence...
-Yeah, I know.

23:42.404 --> 23:43.904
Case closed.

23:43.923 --> 23:47.091
But I will never believe
it's right.

23:48.094 --> 23:50.076
CONRAD:
You mentioned earlier

23:50.096 --> 23:54.265
that your uncle died
of something similar?

23:56.010 --> 23:58.661
Um, a neuroendocrine tumor.

23:58.679 --> 24:01.105
Seems like cancer runs
through our family.

24:01.332 --> 24:03.182
Have you been tested?

24:03.276 --> 24:05.834
No, I haven't had symptoms,
so I never thought to go there.

24:05.928 --> 24:09.280
We can run a genetic test on
you and Bobby, cross-reference

24:09.431 --> 24:13.284
the disease markers,
and if they match...

24:13.360 --> 24:17.246
Keep an eye on you,
we can catch anything early.

24:21.610 --> 24:23.944
Yeah. At least
something positive can come

24:23.963 --> 24:25.754
-from all of this.
-AUSTIN: Yeah.

24:38.886 --> 24:40.794
As soon as she feels better,

24:40.813 --> 24:42.538
and she will soon,
you can get out of here.

24:42.556 --> 24:45.632
But have her stay hydrated for
the remainder of your travels.

24:45.651 --> 24:47.392
I'll make sure of that.
This has been one part

24:47.469 --> 24:49.728
of our adventures that will not
make the photo album.

24:49.880 --> 24:51.304
-Mm-hmm.
-Hello.

24:51.324 --> 24:53.640
Dr. Pravesh tells me
you reside in England.

24:53.659 --> 24:55.400
-Oh, yeah.
-How is our soggy little island?

24:55.495 --> 24:58.996
Oh, thanks to global warming,
less soggy than you remember.

24:59.223 --> 25:01.724
This is my wife
and our CEO, Dr. Voss.

25:01.742 --> 25:05.561
And I told Dr. Voss about your
anxieties over American billing.

25:05.654 --> 25:07.153
Have a look.

25:07.248 --> 25:10.156
My team spoke
with your insurance, and

25:10.176 --> 25:12.751
-it looks like they'll cover
the majority of it.
-Wow.

25:12.903 --> 25:14.586
-This is an incredible relief.
-(monitors beeping)

25:14.739 --> 25:16.138
Thank you.

25:17.833 --> 25:21.060
Oh, excuse me. Hello.

25:22.504 --> 25:25.046
She's become more hypotensive
with a low-grade fever,

25:25.099 --> 25:26.415
and she's sweaty.

25:26.508 --> 25:28.267
-Looks like
an underlying infection.
-Or sepsis.

25:28.361 --> 25:29.752
Could be a number of things.

25:29.845 --> 25:32.345
-Everything okay?
-Aziz,

25:32.365 --> 25:34.606
c-can you get me some water?

25:34.700 --> 25:37.259
There seems to be
a complication, something new.

25:37.319 --> 25:39.519
Claire, we're going
to get you on more fluids.

25:39.613 --> 25:42.206
BELL:
We're gonna start you
on antibiotics and send off

25:42.357 --> 25:45.000
a set of cultures just
to figure out what's going on.

25:56.781 --> 25:58.204
If I ever caught you looking

25:58.224 --> 26:00.540
at Nolan like that,
I'd spontaneously...

26:00.560 --> 26:01.784
-Nolan?
-No?

26:01.802 --> 26:03.394
Oh, really?
That's where your mind goes?

26:03.545 --> 26:05.804
-I don't know. Dr. Paul Chu?
-Hmm.

26:05.956 --> 26:07.547
George Clooney in his<i> ER</i> days.

26:07.567 --> 26:09.958
-That's more of my sweet spot.
-Oh. Touché.

26:09.977 --> 26:11.569
-(laughs)
-Jessica.
Just who I was looking for.

26:11.720 --> 26:13.053
-Donald, hi.
-Hi.

26:13.072 --> 26:15.055
Oh, Irving,
this is Donald Killian.

26:15.074 --> 26:17.132
He's been making my life
so much easier

26:17.225 --> 26:18.742
-since he joined the team.
-Happy to hear that.

26:18.894 --> 26:20.803
-Keep up the great work.
-Thank you.
-(laughs)

26:21.639 --> 26:26.141
You know, I haven't had a chance
to work in Dr. Bell's OR yet.

26:26.143 --> 26:27.567
-Mm-hmm.
-And I'd love the opportunity.

26:27.661 --> 26:29.995
I see you're scheduled with him
tomorrow, and...

26:30.147 --> 26:31.663
Yeah, Dr. Bell's
pretty particular.

26:31.757 --> 26:33.239
He's kind of a creature
of habit.

26:33.259 --> 26:35.593
-Have you worked
with Dr. Sutton?
-No.

26:35.744 --> 26:37.502
She's lovely to assist.

26:37.655 --> 26:39.004
I can arrange that.

26:39.098 --> 26:41.490
Yeah, okay. Um,

26:41.508 --> 26:44.084
you know,
if you're ever busy or tired,

26:44.178 --> 26:45.919
you keep me in mind
for Dr. Bell's cases, too?

26:45.938 --> 26:49.315
Yeah, sure. Uh, how about we go
check out Dr. Sutton's schedule?

26:53.279 --> 26:56.113
I hear you've got
quite the photo collection.

26:56.264 --> 26:58.115
It seems that way. Uh...

26:58.266 --> 27:01.368
I hope I didn't get you
in trouble.

27:05.866 --> 27:09.126
I always thought there might
be something between you two.

27:09.962 --> 27:12.630
Billie was Nic's best friend.

27:12.857 --> 27:16.875
Which explains what exactly?

27:16.969 --> 27:20.286
You know, it's possible for us

27:20.381 --> 27:24.199
to care about each other
and be friends without...

27:24.218 --> 27:28.203
-Benefits?
-BILLIE: Dr. Feldman?

27:28.296 --> 27:29.980
Discharge papers
for your patient in Bay 11.

27:30.207 --> 27:33.400
Just in time.
Thank you very much.

27:34.469 --> 27:36.302
You okay?

27:36.397 --> 27:38.397
What were you looking at?

27:38.491 --> 27:41.641
Ah, just photos
from the wedding.

27:41.810 --> 27:44.328
Well, it was a lovely wedding.

27:45.647 --> 27:48.040
And dance.

27:48.834 --> 27:51.860
I woke up a little confused.

27:51.912 --> 27:53.729
(Conrad sighs)

27:53.822 --> 27:56.256
Yeah, I'm confused, too.

27:57.993 --> 28:00.761
Well, you seem really happy
with Cade.

28:01.588 --> 28:03.663
Am I wrong?

28:03.683 --> 28:05.741
Are you happy?

28:05.759 --> 28:08.268
Yeah, we're happy.

28:13.008 --> 28:15.067
Then I'm not confused.

28:15.695 --> 28:18.195
(pager beeps)

28:20.774 --> 28:23.075
I got to go.

28:29.934 --> 28:32.167
I want you to be happy.

28:39.367 --> 28:42.961
Hey, uh, Dr. Hawkins, yeah?
James Yamada.

28:43.130 --> 28:45.239
I look forward
to working together.

28:45.299 --> 28:47.282
See if the man lives up
to the legend.

28:47.301 --> 28:49.643
Oh, hope I don't disappoint.

28:55.626 --> 28:57.884
I've got great news,
Chief Sutton.

28:57.978 --> 29:00.404
That killer place where
all the chefs go after work?

29:00.631 --> 29:02.464
I scored reservations.

29:02.483 --> 29:05.159
It's harder to get than tickets
to the Super Bowl.

29:07.137 --> 29:10.973
Oh, um... well, unfortunately
I'm working late, so...

29:10.991 --> 29:13.475
It doesn't open until 10:30.

29:13.568 --> 29:16.828
Look, they have this, uh,
Spanish octopus with jalapeño.

29:16.922 --> 29:19.147
I know it sounds kind of weird,
but it's... it's incredible.

29:19.166 --> 29:23.677
Oh, and a-a drink
called Vieux Carré with...

29:27.433 --> 29:31.417
Unless I'm overstepping
and there's someone else.

29:31.437 --> 29:33.604
-Is it Hawkins?
-I'd love to go.

29:33.831 --> 29:35.939
-Yeah?
-Mm-hmm.

29:36.091 --> 29:37.833
Okay.

29:37.960 --> 29:41.028
-Great.
-See you later.

29:45.100 --> 29:47.509
-This is incredible.
-Wild.

29:47.602 --> 29:48.860
What did you find?

29:49.013 --> 29:50.436
Brother, you are not going
to believe this.

29:50.531 --> 29:52.623
I thought
it was a contaminated sample,

29:52.850 --> 29:55.042
so I ran his genetic test again.

29:58.113 --> 30:00.522
Oh, my God. Bobby has chimerism.

30:00.615 --> 30:04.860
That's right. Two sets of DNA
as if he's two different people.

30:04.953 --> 30:07.546
-I never thought
I'd see a case of this.
-You and me both.

30:07.640 --> 30:09.881
Only a hundred cases
have ever been recorded.

30:10.034 --> 30:12.384
Bobby was convicted
with DNA evidence.

30:12.536 --> 30:14.719
-DNA that may not have been his.
-Janaya might be right.

30:14.872 --> 30:16.980
He could be an innocent man.

30:21.654 --> 30:24.154
Like<i> the</i> chimera,

30:24.306 --> 30:27.566
the mythical beast with
the lion's head, goat's body,

30:27.718 --> 30:29.976
and serpent's tail,
except in your case

30:29.995 --> 30:32.387
-it is not a myth.
-CONRAD: In medicine,

30:32.480 --> 30:34.331
chimera refers
to having two sets of DNA.

30:34.500 --> 30:35.557
How's that possible?

30:35.576 --> 30:37.668
Did you have
a bone marrow transplant

30:37.819 --> 30:39.061
to treat your leukemia?

30:39.079 --> 30:41.505
-Yeah, I did.
-JANAYA: When he was ten.

30:41.582 --> 30:43.823
My childhood friend
was my donor.

30:44.026 --> 30:47.085
-He saved my life.
-AUSTIN: Well,
it's quite possible

30:47.237 --> 30:48.920
that your childhood friend
committed a murder,

30:49.073 --> 30:50.238
and you took the fall.

30:50.332 --> 30:53.350
CONRAD:
Bobby, you must have
acquired his DNA

30:53.577 --> 30:57.187
when his bone marrow started
making blood cells in your body.

30:57.339 --> 30:59.247
Cells which have his DNA.

30:59.266 --> 31:04.936
So it was Martin's DNA found
at the crime scene, not Bobby's?

31:05.030 --> 31:07.364
Yeah.

31:10.018 --> 31:13.203
For 15 years
I dreamed of a miracle.

31:15.857 --> 31:18.709
But this...

31:19.620 --> 31:21.770
Do you know where Martin is?

31:21.772 --> 31:24.530
JANAYA:
In prison

31:24.550 --> 31:26.967
for armed robbery.

31:29.704 --> 31:32.872
We are going to appeal and win

31:32.892 --> 31:35.309
and get your life back, Robert.

31:35.969 --> 31:37.543
But is there time?

31:37.638 --> 31:40.789
If we do the surgery,
it's possible.

31:40.958 --> 31:43.609
Then I'll do it.

31:44.478 --> 31:46.111
Please.

31:47.740 --> 31:50.198
Save my life.

31:58.992 --> 32:01.326
CLAIRE:
It hurts!

32:01.420 --> 32:03.069
(groans)

32:03.163 --> 32:05.147
Claire, hang in there.
We're taking you to surgery.

32:05.165 --> 32:07.591
Her pain is getting worse.
What is happening?

32:07.668 --> 32:09.075
We'll know more in the OR.

32:09.094 --> 32:10.819
We think it has something
to do with her infection.

32:10.837 --> 32:12.930
Repeat labs just came back.
Lactate is sky-high.

32:13.081 --> 32:15.340
Cultures show florid gram
negative bacteremia.

32:15.417 --> 32:17.100
The antibiotics aren't working.
She's in refractory shock.

32:17.252 --> 32:19.995
Well, that's probably what's
causing her acute abdomen.

32:20.088 --> 32:21.663
-We have to hurry.
-We got her from here.

32:21.756 --> 32:24.166
I'm waiting for you, Claire.

32:24.184 --> 32:26.276
I love you so much.

32:26.428 --> 32:28.170
(panting)

32:28.188 --> 32:30.739
Let's find you a place
to sit, okay?

32:31.842 --> 32:33.325
Come on.

32:42.294 --> 32:45.520
Looks like I got my wish
sooner than I thought.

32:45.522 --> 32:47.280
No offense,
but I asked for Jessica.

32:47.299 --> 32:50.092
I know,
but she's tied up in OR Four.

32:52.137 --> 32:55.380
-I promise to do my very best.
-Your name again?

32:55.532 --> 32:57.365
Donald.

32:57.384 --> 33:00.060
This is a tough one.
You better keep up.

33:09.213 --> 33:11.321
LEELA:
Hope the damage isn't too bad.

33:11.473 --> 33:13.473
BELL: Me, too. We just told her
she'd be leaving here soon.

33:13.641 --> 33:15.742
Retractors.

33:22.650 --> 33:24.226
(sighs)

33:24.319 --> 33:27.062
-Dead bowel.
She's ischemic already.
-How the hell

33:27.155 --> 33:28.338

Stapler to me.

34:51.665 --> 34:54.849
Let's try and debulk
as much of the tumor as we can

34:54.909 --> 34:58.320
-and reconstruct
the carotid artery.
-To do all that,

34:58.338 --> 34:59.912
we'd have to stop the blood flow
to the brain.

35:00.006 --> 35:01.247

35:01.266 --> 35:03.174
in 20 minutes,
