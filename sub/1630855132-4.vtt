that child, Ziegler?

13:02.615 --> 13:03.949
Called it
a third-grade burglary.

13:06.076 --> 13:07.286
Right this way.

13:08.287 --> 13:10.664
FBI paid me
a little visit today.

13:10.664 --> 13:14.502
- Oh! And what did you tell them?
- Well, I didn't answer the door.

13:14.502 --> 13:18.547
I'm, uh, laying low,
playing it cool.

13:18.547 --> 13:20.883
Do not answer that!

13:20.883 --> 13:24.094
It's probably Dorothy,

13:24.094 --> 13:27.056
but I just can't bring myself
to talk with her.

13:27.056 --> 13:30.351
Good. Because your phones
are tapped by now.

13:30.351 --> 13:33.687
Bastards.
They don't tap my phone!

13:33.687 --> 13:36.899

13:42.571 --> 13:43.572
Hmm.

13:46.450 --> 13:49.495
How much cash do we have left?
Zero.

13:50.788 --> 13:51.914
I shredded it.

13:52.665 --> 13:54.875
You shredded our money?

13:54.875 --> 13:58.295
The money was a direct link
to the Committee.

13:58.295 --> 14:00.089
- What else could I have done?
- Well, I don't know.

14:00.089 --> 14:05.302
Hide it, bury it, launder it.
You do not shred money!

14:05.302 --> 14:07.930
Christ!
This is all McCord's fault.

14:07.930 --> 14:09.306
Why did he leave that tape?

14:09.306 --> 14:11.642

We need more money.

14:31.287 --> 14:32.496
<i>Shall I get that?</i>

14:32.496 --> 14:36.166
- Do not pick up!
- Why are you having a freak-out?

14:36.166 --> 14:38.127
You're not strapped
for cash, are you?

14:58.939 --> 15:00.899

15:06.488 --> 15:08.949

- They will.

and we are home free.

34:48.586 --> 34:50.463

34:57.929 --> 35:00.056

- Come on!

35:09.482 --> 35:13.110

Look at that!

35:13.110 --> 35:15.488
- Oh, lovely...
- You are in for a treat!

35:15.488 --> 35:19.200

to better days?

35:19.200 --> 35:20.535

35:22.328 --> 35:23.371
<i>Prost!</i>

35:23.371 --> 35:26.165
So, now, we just wait
for Nixon to get re-elected.

35:26.165 --> 35:27.458
Fingers crossed.

35:27.458 --> 35:29.627
Well, e-- even then...

35:30.670 --> 35:31.838

to say there, Dot?

35:31.838 --> 35:33.047
Well--
She's-- No. Nothing.

35:33.047 --> 35:35.341
She's not trying
to say anything.

35:35.341 --> 35:39.387
No. I-- I was just saying,
even if Nixon wins,

35:39.387 --> 35:42.723
there's no guarantees
that you all get pardons.

35:42.723 --> 35:43.933
Right, Howard?

35:45.268 --> 35:46.394
Go on, honey.

35:46.394 --> 35:48.688
Tell them your idea.

35:48.688 --> 35:50.565
Well, there--
there's plenty of time

35:50.565 --> 35:52.441
for that after dinner.
Few more drinks.

35:52.441 --> 35:54.610
- Tell them, dear.
- Here's the thing.

35:54.610 --> 35:57.488
Uh, no matter what we say
or don't say,

35:57.488 --> 35:59.532
the story is going to come out.

35:59.532 --> 36:04.996
So, why don't we tell our side
and, uh, and make

36:04.996 --> 36:07.415
- a tidy profit doing it?
- Tell them how much.

36:07.415 --> 36:10.084
Well, my agent thinks
there'll be a bidding war.

36:10.084 --> 36:14.088
And, uh, we're looking
at half a million dollars.

36:14.088 --> 36:16.257
- Maybe more.
- What?

36:16.257 --> 36:20.094
That much for a book?

36:20.094 --> 36:22.054
Unequivocally...

36:22.722 --> 36:23.764
no.

36:24.515 --> 36:27.727
Wait. So, just no?

36:29.812 --> 36:31.981
How the hell
are we supposed to live?

36:31.981 --> 36:34.942

schools, groceries?

36:34.942 --> 36:38.321
I've-- I've, uh,
I've gone back to teaching.

36:39.989 --> 36:43.284

like nobody's business.

36:43.284 --> 36:45.578

- Oh, you're-- you're fine.

36:48.414 --> 36:49.916

your reputations

36:49.916 --> 36:51.459

37:10.269 --> 37:11.395
Right.

37:14.523 --> 37:17.318
We were hired
to win a goddamned election,

37:17.318 --> 37:19.695
and to protect this country
from the Reds.

37:19.695 --> 37:24.200
So, please, tell me how writing
a tell-all book will do that?

37:24.200 --> 37:26.702
- Hmm?
- Gordon, just consider it.

37:27.870 --> 37:29.830
We never implicate
the president.

37:29.830 --> 37:31.832
We just tell our side.

that pretty stewardess

37:55.815 --> 37:59.318
Well, she certainly
recalled you, Mr. Hamilton.

38:02.905 --> 38:05.116
Called the FBI.
Apparently, she received

38:05.116 --> 38:09.787
a copy of your latest pot boiler

38:09.787 --> 38:11.455

Howard, when I get back
I'm taking David,

46:50.933 --> 46:53.310
and we're leaving.
I want a divorce.

You know, there's something
I never told you.

47:08.283 --> 47:12.287
Back when we first got together,
my station chief pulled me

47:12.287 --> 47:15.290
into his office
and showed me a file.

47:15.290 --> 47:16.458
Your file.

47:16.458 --> 47:20.879
They were concerned
that your, uh, visceral hatred

47:20.879 --> 47:25.759
of racism made you vulnerable
to Communist recruitment.

47:25.759 --> 47:29.096

to change my mind?
