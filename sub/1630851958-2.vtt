01:21.915 --> 01:24.542
Hey, mocosa. Why does it
look like one of your drawings?

01:44.395 --> 01:45.647
Dad, what do you think?

01:46.689 --> 01:50.068
No? Okay. Too much.
Chris is right. One million or nothing.

01:51.986 --> 01:54.447
Why'd she offer if she's not negotiating?

01:54.531 --> 01:59.494
Sir…
20,000 is a lot of money.

02:20.890 --> 02:24.227
My name is
Casimiro Morales. I'm an honorable man.

02:24.310 --> 02:28.523
I've owned a taco shop, Mama Fina's,
in Boyle Heights for more than 30 years.

02:30.108 --> 02:34.445
I have another interview tomorrow.
I'm sure they'd love to learn about you…

02:35.280 --> 02:39.242
and hear our lovely story.

06:47.824 --> 06:50.284
Yessika, we need your help.

06:50.368 --> 06:52.995
We've been living
six whole days without water.

06:53.079 --> 06:54.831
We all smell like armpit.

07:03.548 --> 07:07.510
So your landlord cut off
both the water and gas for days at a time?

07:08.094 --> 07:10.721
And the son of a bitch
won't answer my calls.

07:11.431 --> 07:13.391
Cowardly Mr. Potato Face.

07:16.352 --> 07:20.064
We're looking for housing
in your new affordable housing complexes.

07:20.148 --> 07:24.026
-Ana said--
-Señora, there's a giant waiting list.

07:24.110 --> 07:25.069
For years.

07:27.321 --> 07:28.739
-Ana, say something.
-Amá.

07:28.823 --> 07:31.200
God forbid your grandfather
is sent to Mexico,

07:31.284 --> 07:33.536
and you're left without a place
to wash your ass.

07:33.619 --> 07:36.164
And you won't take jobs
from gentrifiers or whatever.

07:36.247 --> 07:37.623
-Amá.
- It's shit.

08:04.859 --> 08:06.861
But we're not just anybody.

08:08.821 --> 08:10.615
Yessika, we are family.

08:11.824 --> 08:13.743
Oh, now we are family?

08:14.577 --> 08:17.830
And all the times
I was just "Ana's Black girlfriend?"

08:18.414 --> 08:19.707
Yessika, forgive me.

08:19.790 --> 08:21.667
I'm a little harsh,

08:22.168 --> 08:24.754
but over the years,
I've gotten more "woke."

08:27.465 --> 08:30.718
Coming here
to ask you for help isn't easy.

08:30.801 --> 08:32.345
Not for me and not for Ana.

08:33.429 --> 08:34.430
But please…

08:35.181 --> 08:38.184
don't punish her
for the sins of her mother.

08:39.727 --> 08:41.229
I'll see what I can do.

09:07.255 --> 09:09.590
A second life for Mama Fina's.

09:25.815 --> 09:28.901
Mama Fina's at the beach?
I like the sound of that.

10:09.108 --> 10:11.986
For me,
two grasshopper tacos and pig's feet.

10:12.069 --> 10:13.029
My favorite.

10:50.024 --> 10:52.234
And your black mole chilaquiles…

10:52.818 --> 10:54.070
delicious!

11:06.707 --> 11:08.417
Bon appétit!

14:10.599 --> 14:12.685
How'd you buy this piece of shit?

14:53.225 --> 14:55.227
Beans. Motherfucker.

14:59.523 --> 15:02.651
Excuse me, sir. Don't be
embarrassed. You've been here long enough.

15:02.735 --> 15:04.320
Your people are waiting for you outside.

15:04.403 --> 15:07.031
Hey now,
aren't I the owner this food truck?

17:30.215 --> 17:31.258
What the hell?

17:31.341 --> 17:34.803
No,
the smell's not coming from outside.

17:36.638 --> 17:37.556
What are you doing?

17:41.769 --> 17:42.644
Come back tomorrow.

17:43.353 --> 17:45.314
No record.

18:00.245 --> 18:02.039
No.
He's investing in his family.

18:02.122 --> 18:04.625
You're the one addicted
to turning your back on us.

18:59.304 --> 19:01.640
Who has him here against his will?

19:15.362 --> 19:19.241
I never told him that.

19:19.324 --> 19:20.951
He's exactly like my brother.

19:30.377 --> 19:31.461
For you.

19:36.133 --> 19:37.718
Please, Dad, seriously…

21:49.182 --> 21:50.642
What's wrong?

22:03.113 --> 22:04.865
It's worse than that, Pop.

22:16.793 --> 22:18.795
We've all had our lovestruck moments…

22:40.942 --> 22:44.404
My love,
don't worry about your grandpa.

22:44.488 --> 22:46.615
I don't need anything. I take care of you.

23:17.979 --> 23:19.022
My way…

24:03.191 --> 24:04.651
I can't anymore.

24:18.957 --> 24:20.876
When we close, that's it.

24:22.294 --> 24:24.546
You have to go live your life.
Go to Paris.

24:32.012 --> 24:36.850
No joke. That's the
20,000 dollars you put into Mama Fina's.

24:41.771 --> 24:43.148
Stop fucking around.

24:45.525 --> 24:50.864
It's the money I owe you. I don't have it
yet because that woman hasn't paid me yet.

24:51.448 --> 24:53.366
Take it. And get out of Boyle Heights.

24:53.450 --> 24:56.828
Go become a chef
that the entire world will respect.

24:58.079 --> 24:59.247
Working with…

25:00.582 --> 25:04.127
a broken old man…

25:05.295 --> 25:06.505
you won't have a future.

25:08.340 --> 25:12.093
I'm leaving!
Go! Mama Fina's doesn't exist anymore.
