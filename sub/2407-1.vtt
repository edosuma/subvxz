03:41.100 --> 03:47.123
The Mummy resurrected

05:14.981 --> 05:16.849
- Maggie.
- Hello.

05:16.884 --> 05:19.064
I need you inside,
Geri did a version...

05:19.099 --> 05:20.507
Hieroglífica the "Pictionaria".

05:21.555 --> 05:24.312
Can you believe it?
Did he really come?

05:27.702 --> 05:29.422
Santa arrives at the hotel tonight at 18:30

05:30.162 --> 05:33.288
Do you think a vigil
outside is a good idea?

05:33.323 --> 05:34.665
Am I being childish?

05:34.700 --> 05:36.713
Considering how they should be here...

05:36.748 --> 05:38.335
Been waiting for two days.

05:38.370 --> 05:40.503
I know, I should not be so excited, but...

05:40.638 --> 05:42.290
- I can not contain myself.
- I can not contain myself.

05:42.607 --> 05:45.611
You know,
plus occasional photos...

05:45.646 --> 05:47.993
You have not seen... or heard of it...

05:49.145 --> 05:50.712
In almost 20 years.

05:50.747 --> 05:53.338
I just want you to control
their expectations, that's all.

05:53.373 --> 05:55.868
If this does not correspond to the same...

05:56.051 --> 05:58.340
- ... Enthusiasm.
- Of course.

05:58.452 --> 05:59.719
It's my father.

05:59.754 --> 06:01.020
I hope so.

06:01.055 --> 06:03.744
You can not know for sure how someone is.

06:04.492 --> 06:06.035
I think so.

06:06.070 --> 06:07.578
And how do you know?

06:07.661 --> 06:09.383
I can feel it.

06:09.465 --> 06:11.164
Always have these feelings?

06:11.199 --> 06:14.890
Yes, I know of no person
in their right mind would do that.

06:16.905 --> 06:19.228
We should not enter?

06:19.439 --> 06:21.797
She tried, I'll wait out here.

06:21.841 --> 06:25.701
And you will lose all the drama
Geri game invented?

06:26.211 --> 06:28.179
Hey!
They will not come?

06:28.214 --> 06:30.236
I spent all night doing this thing.

06:30.271 --> 06:31.983
His father will finally arrive.

06:32.018 --> 06:33.725
- Seriously, is it?
- Yes

06:33.760 --> 06:35.432
- Now?
- Girls.

06:35.467 --> 06:36.718
Let's go.

06:36.753 --> 06:38.803
- I know.
- You can enter?

06:40.323 --> 06:42.171
- Please?
- Okay, and you listened.

06:42.206 --> 06:43.609
At long departure.

06:43.666 --> 06:46.345
Okay, listen.
The party is over.

06:53.035 --> 06:55.894
Girl, look at you.

06:56.405 --> 06:59.195
What a beautiful woman you've become!

07:00.207 --> 07:03.295
- Hello.
- Come here and give your old man a hug.

07:10.650 --> 07:13.066
You look like your mother.

07:13.653 --> 07:16.171
I loved her more than his own life.

07:17.790 --> 07:19.257
Which means...

07:19.292 --> 07:21.183
I'll love you even more.

07:22.694 --> 07:25.547
I see you brought the whole
class of "moral support".

07:25.582 --> 07:28.015
Mr. Tralane, nice to meet you finally.

07:28.067 --> 07:29.674
I've heard a lot about you.

07:29.709 --> 07:31.016
Of course.

07:31.101 --> 07:33.601
You can not leave a mark that lasts.

07:33.636 --> 07:36.052
If you always walk on tiptoes.

07:37.608 --> 07:39.897
Father, this is Veronica Korvac.

07:40.678 --> 07:43.297
Yes, I am eternally grateful.

07:43.980 --> 07:47.967
You know, I do not think it would been able
to bring my daughter here without you.

07:48.950 --> 07:51.630
It's a pleasure to finally meet you, too.

07:51.665 --> 07:54.138
I am a big fan.

07:54.524 --> 07:56.073
Ever since.

07:56.657 --> 07:59.050
Looks like I have some of those days.

07:59.960 --> 08:02.227
'm Geri... Grant.

08:02.262 --> 08:04.176
Yes, of course you're the...

08:04.530 --> 08:07.048
The girl who found the last two
burial sites.

08:07.733 --> 08:10.286
- That's right.
- Well, I must say I'm a fan of yours.

08:10.970 --> 08:12.348
Very well, dear.

08:12.383 --> 08:13.671
Well done.

08:13.706 --> 08:15.352
Last but not least...

08:15.387 --> 08:16.856
Sara Winchester.

08:16.891 --> 08:18.325
Kelly Kennedy.

08:18.377 --> 08:19.858
Kennedy.

08:21.946 --> 08:23.179
Look at you.

08:23.214 --> 08:24.581
It's so refreshing.

08:24.616 --> 08:26.609
It is so refreshing to work again with...

08:26.644 --> 08:28.603
Spirits so young and full of energy.

08:28.852 --> 08:31.610
Now who wants to come with me for a drink?

08:34.291 --> 08:37.182
You must have had a very long journey,
surely you are tired.

08:37.292 --> 08:38.876
It does not matter.

08:39.028 --> 08:41.078
Okay, how about...

08:41.929 --> 08:45.325
The update.
Long ago.

08:46.167 --> 08:47.819
Well, this is your room.

08:47.936 --> 08:49.725
See you in the morning.

09:01.914 --> 09:04.467
Before you go,
I have something for you.

09:09.755 --> 09:11.588
Not the original.

09:11.623 --> 09:13.514
He has been missing for decades.

09:14.459 --> 09:18.183
But it is an excellent copy,
1 of 2 replicas in your hand.

09:18.427 --> 09:20.183
Where did you get that?

09:20.464 --> 09:22.264
I've been in many places.

09:22.299 --> 09:25.757
I managed with some Armenian friends.

09:25.792 --> 09:27.620
It was expensive, but worth it.

09:27.655 --> 09:29.404
Cartography is amazing.

09:29.439 --> 09:31.722
Looks like we're in the same place.

09:31.757 --> 09:33.307
I think you get the idea.

09:33.342 --> 09:37.136
But I really need that Miss
Winchester and you translate the terms.

09:37.247 --> 09:39.367
Unless you can.

09:42.517 --> 09:45.103
No, you stay with it for now.

09:46.087 --> 09:48.034
I hope you do not try to bribe me.

09:50.391 --> 09:52.077
Maggie.

09:52.259 --> 09:55.505
I know I have not done
a good job for you.

09:55.540 --> 09:57.011
And I'm sorry.

09:57.831 --> 09:59.920
But although it sounds cliché.

09:59.955 --> 10:01.415
I had my reasons.

10:01.667 --> 10:02.900
Let's go.

10:02.935 --> 10:04.381
I forgot.

10:04.837 --> 10:06.353
We're together now.

10:06.571 --> 10:08.895
As I hope will be for a long time.

10:10.141 --> 10:12.032
If you depend on me, baby.

10:12.276 --> 10:13.997
Will be forever.

10:26.788 --> 10:29.909
'm Madu, his connection with the SCA.

10:30.493 --> 10:32.077
Sorry for the intrusion.

10:32.362 --> 10:34.755
But I can not take them
to the region tomorrow.

10:35.298 --> 10:36.881
And, for your own safety...

10:37.165 --> 10:39.250
I revoke your permission.

10:40.167 --> 10:42.024
There is evil in the Valley.

10:42.302 --> 10:43.902
A great, great evil.

10:43.937 --> 10:46.597
He swore that all who come to the Valley.

10:46.632 --> 10:48.328
Raiders of the unspeakable.

10:48.363 --> 10:50.024
"never come back".

15:03.332 --> 15:05.017
Sorcerer Valley.

15:05.567 --> 15:08.341
Now I see why your guides
government does not want to go.

15:08.737 --> 15:10.753
But you will. Right?

15:11.373 --> 15:14.096
You are not afraid of old superstitions.

15:16.077 --> 15:18.594
Border guards in Libya are not a myth.

15:19.044 --> 15:21.664
They make many excursions along the border.

15:22.147 --> 15:23.673
More than anything at night but...

15:23.708 --> 15:25.509
At times during the day.

15:26.086 --> 15:28.196
Looking for prey.

15:28.231 --> 15:30.306
As you and your group.

15:30.390 --> 15:32.611
In this case, we are not just guides.

15:34.525 --> 15:36.473
We are also...

15:36.759 --> 15:38.549
Protection.

15:41.233 --> 15:42.851
I need more money.

15:43.935 --> 15:45.027
And early

15:45.128 --> 15:47.278
$ 700.

15:47.313 --> 15:50.654
Not a penny more,
half now, half in return.

15:55.277 --> 15:58.136
And where do we take it?

15:58.146 --> 16:02.373
I'm sure there will be many
who would like to earn $ 700.

16:16.295 --> 16:19.553
I think the term is...
"We have an agreement."

16:39.250 --> 16:41.300
Come on everybody time to load things.

16:49.391 --> 16:50.558
What?

16:50.593 --> 16:51.960
Mr. Madu retired.

16:51.995 --> 16:54.042
So we had to find an alternative.

16:54.077 --> 16:55.944
They are able to get a license?

16:56.164 --> 16:57.663
We do not need one now.

16:57.698 --> 16:59.398
My father and I will
take care of that later.

16:59.433 --> 17:02.326
Do not tell me that you took the
Kool-Aid after a day.

17:02.401 --> 17:04.291
It does not form part of the same...

17:04.327 --> 17:06.184
Archaeological excavation in this country.

17:06.219 --> 17:08.020
Much less carry one.

17:08.055 --> 17:09.776
He leads, I do.

17:09.810 --> 17:12.037
Then act in the rules, so you do not...

17:12.071 --> 17:14.263
Ruin his career before it began.

17:14.614 --> 17:16.348
Come on, we'll be fine.

17:16.383 --> 17:19.137
They are very strict about
excavations in this country.

17:19.218 --> 17:21.465
You know, Tralane know.

17:21.501 --> 17:22.901
I know what, honey?

17:25.290 --> 17:26.976
You need a license.

17:28.358 --> 17:30.525
No, if you will only find the tomb.

17:30.560 --> 17:33.249
We'll be fine,
while we do not change anything there.

17:33.931 --> 17:36.584
Right? We can not miss the day ..

17:41.370 --> 17:46.028
I do not know, it sounded version
archeology of "just the tip".

17:46.142 --> 17:48.968
And we all know how
you enjoy playing it.

17:53.248 --> 17:55.003
Sorry Teacher.

17:55.150 --> 17:57.483
- Yes?
- I've seen it.

17:57.518 --> 18:00.931
And it seems that a part of it, is lost.

18:00.966 --> 18:02.654
- Seriously?
- Yes

18:02.689 --> 18:05.480
All pages after
Van Heim reach the tomb.

18:06.126 --> 18:07.949
It is as if they had been removed.

18:14.466 --> 18:16.049
You're right.

18:16.299 --> 18:20.082
It seems my Armenian friends were mild.

18:20.117 --> 18:23.590
They sold me damaged goods bastards.

18:24.842 --> 18:26.392
Now what?

18:26.876 --> 18:29.370
The story is there for us to write.

18:58.904 --> 19:00.386
Made all the lists?

19:02.576 --> 19:04.231
I think we should leave the team.

19:04.266 --> 19:05.842
Not even enter the tomb.

19:05.877 --> 19:08.050
Just make sure to fill your water bottle.

19:08.179 --> 19:09.701
We need to stay hydrated here.

19:09.736 --> 19:11.367
- Well, come on.
- Okay.

19:29.866 --> 19:31.299
What was that?

19:31.334 --> 19:33.157
Nothing my dear, nothing.

19:33.969 --> 19:35.791
Just go walking.

19:36.104 --> 19:37.756
Come on, now, now.

19:50.391 --> 19:51.702
We should...

20:01.227 --> 20:03.661
So what was this great evil...

20:03.762 --> 20:05.852
Mr. Madu was so afraid?

20:06.164 --> 20:07.919
Nothing.

20:08.033 --> 20:10.220
Just nonsense.

20:11.001 --> 20:14.815
They helped create the
mystery that is Egypt.

20:14.850 --> 20:16.593
Seemed very convincing.

20:21.111 --> 20:23.799
Surely you have the
determination to Tralane.

20:25.548 --> 20:27.872
In the old days there was a...

20:28.417 --> 20:30.069
Great Wizard.

20:30.585 --> 20:32.807
A king or queen...

20:32.920 --> 20:36.909
That... was erased from history forever.

20:38.693 --> 20:40.743
A great, great sorcerer.

20:41.061 --> 20:43.955
He had no name, no name.

20:44.498 --> 20:48.154
And who said that his name
could disappear from life.

20:48.968 --> 20:52.990
Something worse than death, nothing.

20:53.272 --> 20:55.791
To resurface again in the other world.

20:56.476 --> 20:58.890
And that is what we seek?

20:59.111 --> 21:02.165
That, dear,
is what you will find.

21:06.616 --> 21:08.132
Let's go?

21:38.744 --> 21:40.011
Hey, here.

21:40.046 --> 21:43.202
You see the hieroglyphics destroyed
at the entrance of the tomb?

21:44.216 --> 21:46.769
Was to confuse the messengers of Anubis.

21:50.122 --> 21:51.877
Come on, come on.

22:28.121 --> 22:29.671
Here it is.

22:33.925 --> 22:36.616
I can not believe he's here.

22:36.729 --> 22:39.249
What does this mean in
the old Van Heim now?

22:40.300 --> 22:41.952
Hey, wait a second.

22:41.968 --> 22:45.145
And if we return to the village
to see if you get a license?

22:45.180 --> 22:48.323
- Now?
- I do not want to miss this discovery.

22:48.439 --> 22:49.905
By a simple procedure.

22:49.940 --> 22:51.737
I said I would not enter the tomb...

22:51.772 --> 22:53.534
here is allowed.

22:53.569 --> 22:54.710
And I meant it.

22:54.745 --> 22:56.364
I'm the boss, remember?

22:56.746 --> 22:58.535
Yes, sorry boss.

23:05.388 --> 23:07.734
What are they doing,
is not yet time to go...

23:07.769 --> 23:09.268
Has sun for hours.

23:09.303 --> 23:10.704
Insurance is nothing.

23:10.759 --> 23:13.812
You continue to work and I did.

23:16.399 --> 23:17.631
Something wrong?

23:17.666 --> 23:19.066
It seems that something is wrong.

23:19.101 --> 23:21.885
- All is well.
- It looks very ugly.

23:21.920 --> 23:23.886
Let's take a look.

23:26.139 --> 23:27.918
It's not safe here now.

23:27.953 --> 23:29.828
Do not waste my time.

23:29.863 --> 23:31.360
Right?

23:35.047 --> 23:36.315
I see nothing.

23:36.350 --> 23:39.265
Probably, just want to take
the money from his father.

23:39.584 --> 23:41.066
They do it all the time.

23:41.353 --> 23:43.109
What is this cloud of dust?

23:43.488 --> 23:45.105
Seems chenado close.

23:45.556 --> 23:46.823
Cloud of dust?

23:46.858 --> 23:48.652
- Seriously?
- Whatever.

23:48.687 --> 23:50.446
Surely will only follow your path.

23:50.528 --> 23:53.094
We are here at the top, right?

23:53.129 --> 23:55.716
Come on, do not we have more
important things to do?

23:55.765 --> 23:57.350
Yes, we have.

23:57.435 --> 23:59.417
Come on, we'll be fine.

23:59.602 --> 24:01.994
My dad will not let anything
bad happen to us.

24:02.070 --> 24:03.637
Libyan guards are here.

24:03.672 --> 24:05.830
Shut up, we're here.

24:13.549 --> 24:15.030
They are here now.

24:15.816 --> 24:17.248
Take care of them.

24:17.283 --> 24:19.106
Come see, come.

24:53.213 --> 24:54.944
I thought you translated this.

24:56.720 --> 24:59.077
Well, all arranged.

24:59.221 --> 25:01.378
See, false alarm.

25:01.413 --> 25:03.147
Okay?

25:04.059 --> 25:06.259
Yes, of course.

25:06.294 --> 25:10.315
They wanted to talk about charges
additional and extra work hours.

25:10.363 --> 25:12.145
More importantly, what happens here?

25:12.180 --> 25:13.932
At this time, nothing.

25:13.967 --> 25:16.191
Looks like someone is a little rusty.

25:16.226 --> 25:18.371
I think it should be on a wall.

25:18.406 --> 25:21.463
Yes, it was all too good to be true, right?

25:21.498 --> 25:24.521
Things are a bit cryptic at the moment.

25:24.556 --> 25:26.177
After researching.

25:26.212 --> 25:29.963
I discovered that the key
is in building the car.

25:29.998 --> 25:32.500
Although it is not imaginary.

25:32.535 --> 25:35.016
Then, the letters "AMAMPMD".

25:35.051 --> 25:37.452
- So the word "bear".
- Bear.

25:37.487 --> 25:39.766
It is written in the
margin on the car floor.

25:39.801 --> 25:41.189
Set the car.

25:41.224 --> 25:43.002
The assembly in the car.

25:43.037 --> 25:44.678
Or inside the bear.

25:46.029 --> 25:47.529
Yes...

25:47.564 --> 25:50.332
They are colloquial 17th century.

25:50.367 --> 25:52.478
Track or any other words of wisdom?

25:52.513 --> 25:53.983
That's it.

25:54.102 --> 25:56.770
He wrote that when he opened the tomb...

25:56.805 --> 25:59.292
The sun had set,
with his guards left.

25:59.327 --> 26:00.435
Then there are a couple of pages...

26:00.470 --> 26:02.879
Was so excited, I could not sleep.

26:02.914 --> 26:05.289
He was vigilant in heaven
that guided me.

26:05.324 --> 26:07.433
But nothing more.

26:08.382 --> 26:10.273
Set the car.

26:10.751 --> 26:13.235
- Or Bear?
- Perhaps talked about...

26:13.753 --> 26:15.474
constellations

26:15.523 --> 26:18.867
The car, you know, part of Ursa Major.

26:18.902 --> 26:20.544
The Bear.

26:22.827 --> 26:24.540
In their language, the car...

26:24.575 --> 26:26.254
It is known as the "plow."

26:26.665 --> 26:28.249
The cart.

26:28.566 --> 26:30.823
That seems like a constellation.

26:30.902 --> 26:33.454
The Egyptians called the eternal rocks.

26:33.736 --> 26:37.432
They feared that the constellation
disappeared in the night sky.

26:37.467 --> 26:39.322
And that symbolized eternity.

26:39.442 --> 26:44.239
And these letters, "AMAMPMD".

26:44.781 --> 26:47.367
Supports for the first seven stars.

26:47.483 --> 26:50.177
The key is the order of star formation.

28:05.618 --> 28:07.030
What the hell was that?

28:07.220 --> 28:08.740
Seemed fireworks.

28:08.775 --> 28:10.238
Seemed more shots.

28:35.177 --> 28:37.089
I think our guys are under attack.

28:37.124 --> 28:38.834
- Who attacked?
- I dont know.

28:38.880 --> 28:40.328
I dont know.

29:21.285 --> 29:23.005
Oh. Shit.

29:25.454 --> 29:27.278
- They are coming, they were killed.
- What?

29:27.289 --> 29:29.841
- Who comes?
- I have no idea.

29:30.092 --> 29:32.108
- Who comes?
- Fuck that.

29:32.143 --> 29:33.695
I'm here!

29:36.420 --> 29:39.107
- What if you were arrested?
- You know, I could not tell you.

29:39.108 --> 29:40.108
Come on, God!

29:50.524 --> 29:51.932
A small detail, so...

29:51.979 --> 29:53.145
How close the door?

29:53.180 --> 29:55.425
Even though we did not discuss the matter.

29:55.460 --> 29:56.898
- Get in there.
- Okay.

30:22.772 --> 30:24.219
Now what?

30:25.075 --> 30:26.761
Only hope.

30:26.910 --> 30:29.426
While they can not enter,
we'll be fine.

30:29.744 --> 30:31.499
I want to make a practical question.

30:32.280 --> 30:34.763
What happens when you do not
get to the hotel tonight?

30:34.815 --> 30:36.625
Not sent someone?

30:36.660 --> 30:38.436
There was an official guide.

30:38.719 --> 30:40.405
Nobody knows we're here.

30:41.489 --> 30:43.141
Do not worry dear.

30:43.690 --> 30:45.022
We'll be fine.

30:45.057 --> 30:47.910
I was in a situation
There are similarly many years.

30:47.945 --> 30:50.107
And emerges victorious.

30:50.142 --> 30:51.796
Was in Sudan.

30:51.831 --> 30:53.621
I was stuck for days.

30:56.468 --> 30:58.018
Hey.

30:58.103 --> 30:59.686
Okay?

31:03.173 --> 31:05.443
I take that as a "yes"?

31:05.478 --> 31:07.887
Maggie did not want to tell you...
"I told you."

31:07.922 --> 31:09.278
So do not tell

31:09.313 --> 31:11.671
Well, it's just a setback.

31:12.248 --> 31:13.882
A setback is...

31:13.917 --> 31:17.208
Waking up with a hangover,
20 minutes before a test.

31:17.920 --> 31:19.472
This is crazy.

31:19.956 --> 31:21.423
It's an adventure.

31:21.458 --> 31:23.767
Imagine what this will be for
forever in our memories.

31:23.802 --> 31:26.077
If you survive the time
enough to write.

31:26.160 --> 31:28.772
Clueless, come on, we'll be fine.

31:28.807 --> 31:30.574
I will, I promise.

31:30.609 --> 31:32.080
Trust me.

31:32.766 --> 31:35.787
Maggie, I trust in you.

31:36.971 --> 31:39.591
He would not let anything bad
happen to us.

31:40.105 --> 31:41.849
He would not, I know.

31:41.884 --> 31:43.593
- I'm your daughter.
- Hey.

31:44.443 --> 31:46.130
Best to come here.

31:49.615 --> 31:51.164
Gone?

31:51.416 --> 31:53.349
- How is he going to do?
- Look at that.

31:54.253 --> 31:56.644
Went there without saying anything?

31:56.687 --> 31:58.373
Should have prevented?

31:59.157 --> 32:01.383
At a time when his father
was talking about...

32:01.418 --> 32:03.115
Being stuck in a tomb.

32:03.194 --> 32:05.525
And found a back door to exit.

32:06.029 --> 32:08.361
And then he started talking
with Winchester in German.

32:08.364 --> 32:10.381
Two seconds later.

32:10.933 --> 32:12.484
This.

32:13.002 --> 32:14.335
This guy is a gem.

32:14.370 --> 32:17.264
He passed expeditions before we were born.

32:17.473 --> 32:19.387
I'm sure he knows what he does.

32:19.808 --> 32:21.174
I am afraid.

32:21.209 --> 32:22.850
This is a way out then?

32:22.885 --> 32:24.492
If so, he would have gone.

32:24.912 --> 32:27.641
Probably just takes you to one
deepest place of the tomb.

32:27.676 --> 32:29.086
Winchester.

32:29.121 --> 32:30.496
Teacher.

32:31.185 --> 32:32.941
We must go after them.

32:33.620 --> 32:36.013
Yes... you are the daughter of his father.

32:36.288 --> 32:37.554
I'll go with you.

32:37.589 --> 32:40.882
Geri. Maybe better
if you stay here.

32:41.894 --> 32:44.100
I've been on other expeditions,
you know.

32:44.135 --> 32:46.048
I have a good idea what to do.

32:46.331 --> 32:47.530
I'm sure, but...

32:47.565 --> 32:49.381
We need someone to stay here.

32:49.416 --> 32:50.599
With them.

32:50.634 --> 32:52.527
More memories, right?

32:57.808 --> 32:59.333
Winchester.

32:59.368 --> 33:00.858
Teacher.

33:01.977 --> 33:03.893
They must be joking.

33:04.014 --> 33:06.127
They could disappear into thin air.

33:06.162 --> 33:07.734
What's down there?

33:09.918 --> 33:11.707
A narrow corridor.

33:12.787 --> 33:15.042
Like your father did to pass around?

33:15.090 --> 33:17.750
He knows how to pass through
of a tight spot.

33:17.785 --> 33:20.411
It is determined, yes I admit.

33:20.528 --> 33:22.044
That's it.

33:22.062 --> 33:23.544
Let's go?

33:42.780 --> 33:44.331
Hear that?

33:44.615 --> 33:47.009
- What?
- It sounded like a growl.

33:48.318 --> 33:50.107
- As a lion.
- Please.

33:50.153 --> 33:51.452
Simply.

33:51.487 --> 33:53.066
They were a long time already?

33:53.101 --> 33:54.489
I have no idea.

33:54.524 --> 33:57.001
They should not mind
I need something

33:57.036 --> 33:58.611
To calm myself.

33:59.229 --> 34:00.695
Where did you get the grass?

34:00.730 --> 34:02.718
- In hotel.
- You can not smoke it here.

34:02.753 --> 34:04.798
Sure, I have a recipe.

34:04.833 --> 34:06.781
That means nothing in Egypt.

34:07.001 --> 34:09.333
When you're in jail,
teach your recipe.

34:11.071 --> 34:13.864
Do not worry,
I'll finish before returning.

34:17.579 --> 34:19.094
Or you wanted some?

34:19.447 --> 34:21.012
You?

34:21.047 --> 34:23.257
She is already a paranoid hypochondriac.

34:23.293 --> 34:24.880
Want to do worse?

34:24.916 --> 34:26.889
- I'm not paranoid.
- No?

34:26.925 --> 34:28.820
Just heard a growl.

34:28.855 --> 34:30.455
Was right about the dust cloud.

34:30.489 --> 34:33.610
Look, if I had listened,
we would not be stuck here.

34:35.161 --> 34:37.849
Are you sure?
Can calm your nerves.

34:38.428 --> 34:40.480
- No thanks.
- What a shame.

34:41.299 --> 34:43.018
Works great for me.

34:44.534 --> 34:46.480
As if you had any
reason to be nervous.

34:46.514 --> 34:49.625
Hey, I do not have to
justify myself to you.

34:51.407 --> 34:54.061
I had things that no girl should have.

34:54.542 --> 34:57.198
Things to fuck your life.

34:58.848 --> 35:00.473
June 14, 1995.

35:00.508 --> 35:02.099
I will never forget.

35:02.449 --> 35:04.297
Attacked a hospital in Chernobyl.

35:04.332 --> 35:05.905
I was with my mother.

35:06.088 --> 35:08.174
She was executed in front of me.

35:08.457 --> 35:09.889
For the next two days.

35:09.924 --> 35:12.837
I was locked in a room
with dead and dying.

35:12.872 --> 35:15.686
I do not feel good inside.

35:16.363 --> 35:17.795
This.

35:17.830 --> 35:19.346
It helps me deal with it.

35:25.971 --> 35:27.404
What?

35:27.439 --> 35:28.672
Try a little?

35:28.707 --> 35:30.502
Believe me, a little bit and...

35:30.537 --> 35:32.297
I left completely relaxed.

35:32.776 --> 35:35.031
Will help you forget all those sounds.

35:42.253 --> 35:43.552
Let's go.

35:43.587 --> 35:46.914
A city girl like you
never traveled before?

35:52.661 --> 35:54.951
Father, my God.

35:54.996 --> 35:56.598
I was very scared.

35:56.633 --> 35:59.043
It is quiet, there is no
reason to be alarmed.

35:59.078 --> 36:00.434
- We are well.
- What were they thinking?

36:00.469 --> 36:02.641
I can not believe
you just go out like that.

36:02.670 --> 36:04.828
We have enough problems?

36:04.863 --> 36:06.137
Not a bit, dear.

36:06.172 --> 36:09.053
We track the most fantastic discovery.

36:09.088 --> 36:10.525
Let's go.

36:11.778 --> 36:13.761
Look, Maggie.

36:15.048 --> 36:16.734
Anankatep.

36:16.983 --> 36:19.033
True High Priest and Guardian...

36:19.286 --> 36:21.473
Unnamed.

36:21.886 --> 36:23.573
Actually, I think.

36:23.589 --> 36:24.922
Yes.

36:24.957 --> 36:27.407
And the answer must be the secret here.

36:28.794 --> 36:30.981
- This is amazing.
- Yes

36:53.981 --> 36:55.565
Oh, my God.

37:23.409 --> 37:24.321
Hello?

37:27.173 --> 37:28.433
Hello?

37:35.885 --> 37:38.441
Through the mutilation of
the body is secured...

37:38.476 --> 37:41.007
As not to arouse the spirit world.

37:41.525 --> 37:46.216
The remote location is to
prevent messengers from beyond.

37:46.260 --> 37:49.183
According to legend, the
anonymous had no intention...

37:49.218 --> 37:51.364
Go to the Kingdom of the Dead.

37:51.399 --> 37:54.111
Instead, the wait here
grave for millennia.

37:54.146 --> 37:56.350
Until the day that would be
risen again.

37:56.385 --> 37:57.956
In the mortal world.

37:58.204 --> 38:01.462
Teacher, and on the door that said Geri?

38:02.208 --> 38:03.792
Yes, of course.

38:04.144 --> 38:08.130
If this tomb was built as the others,
and I think it was.

38:08.180 --> 38:10.868
Workers should be close to the camera.

38:10.982 --> 38:12.964
Great, where do we find it?

39:35.723 --> 39:37.390
- You hear that?
- What?

39:37.491 --> 39:38.608
No!

39:38.643 --> 39:39.809
Seemed a scream.

39:39.893 --> 39:41.614
Kennedy seemed...

39:48.336 --> 39:49.920
Geri?

39:51.137 --> 39:53.427
Geri? I am here.

39:53.505 --> 39:54.983
What happened?
Are you okay?

39:55.018 --> 39:57.127
My God, Maggie.

40:01.381 --> 40:02.863
She is dead.

40:03.683 --> 40:05.301
My God.

40:05.551 --> 40:07.066
She is dead.

40:13.189 --> 40:15.047
We're screwed.

40:15.124 --> 40:16.859
I wish I could do something.

40:16.894 --> 40:19.547
For starters, the fantasy
of father and daughter...

40:19.796 --> 40:21.029
Get over it.

40:21.064 --> 40:22.648
Now it's a nightmare.

40:22.730 --> 40:24.382
That's not fair.

40:24.799 --> 40:27.590
If not, why Kelly is dead.

40:27.702 --> 40:30.962
It's not your fault, it was an accident.

40:31.339 --> 40:34.097
Maggie, all are guilty.

40:34.443 --> 40:36.664
All came here and we should not.

40:37.079 --> 40:39.144
It's like he wanted to happen.

40:39.179 --> 40:42.326
Nobody wanted the Titanic hit the iceberg,
but it happened.

40:42.361 --> 40:46.034
Maggie, I do not know what kind of
control he has over you.

40:46.069 --> 40:47.899
But you have to react.

40:47.986 --> 40:52.067
From now on,
if he wants to go it alone, leave it.

40:52.102 --> 40:53.642
We were in the group.

40:53.677 --> 40:55.183
We leave it to us.

40:55.218 --> 40:56.676
Okay!

40:59.363 --> 41:01.311
I hope all is well back there.

41:01.799 --> 41:03.417
Certainly.

41:05.202 --> 41:08.257
Probably Miss Kennedy
wanted a little attention.

41:35.829 --> 41:37.362
Maybe we should go see.

41:37.664 --> 41:39.419
Whatever you want, dear.

41:40.932 --> 41:43.690
I'll be more useful here.

42:24.171 --> 42:25.871
What was that?

42:25.906 --> 42:31.169
I think it is an incantation used to
the resurrection process.

42:32.312 --> 42:33.890
Can you imagine that?

42:33.925 --> 42:35.328
Right?

42:40.586 --> 42:42.095
So...

42:42.130 --> 42:43.605
What happened?

42:45.391 --> 42:48.876
Ask her,
was she who drugged Kelly.

42:48.993 --> 42:51.078
Why would grass to Egypt?

42:51.095 --> 42:53.351
I did not bring, I picked up at the hotel.

42:54.199 --> 42:56.098
This drove her crazy.

42:56.133 --> 42:58.876
Hey, I also smoked and I did not freak.

42:58.911 --> 43:01.619
Not everyone reacts the same way.

43:01.905 --> 43:03.271
You know.

43:03.306 --> 43:05.719
I'm telling Maggie was not the grass.

43:06.007 --> 43:07.539
Nothing happened to me.

43:07.574 --> 43:10.630
Something happened to her, it was clear.

43:10.713 --> 43:12.413
The second was good.

43:12.448 --> 43:14.121
And before he could move,

43:14.222 --> 43:15.364
ran out of here.

43:16.519 --> 43:18.342
We heard screams and...

43:18.986 --> 43:20.705
Then everything fell apart.

43:22.656 --> 43:24.912
Come on, let's find the rest.

43:25.392 --> 43:27.847
True, we took our
things and go.

43:27.882 --> 43:29.879
Wait, what do we do?

43:32.698 --> 43:34.555
Kelly?

43:38.503 --> 43:40.136
We'll have to leave it here.

43:40.171 --> 43:42.338
Only until we can return
with the authorities.

43:42.373 --> 43:43.839
And how do we do this?

43:44.074 --> 43:46.398
There are guys with guns at the door.

43:46.444 --> 43:48.856
Never leave here.

43:48.891 --> 43:51.268
We will face them or we will die here.

43:51.549 --> 43:52.949
Come on, do not say it.

43:52.984 --> 43:54.483
I know you want to get out of here.

43:54.518 --> 43:57.309
Heard my father, They've been
in situations like this before.

43:57.587 --> 43:59.637
I know he knows how to get out.

44:00.121 --> 44:02.275
Let's get our stuff and go.

44:08.396 --> 44:10.048
Oh, great.

44:17.836 --> 44:20.492
I really think we should go back.

44:29.414 --> 44:32.035
Why do not we see where it leads?

44:32.516 --> 44:36.380
- I dont know.
- And your sense of adventure?

44:37.556 --> 44:40.601
Trust me, we'll find
is fascinating.

44:40.636 --> 44:42.206
What about the rest?

44:42.241 --> 44:43.776
Now we come.

44:44.461 --> 44:46.318
There is only one place to go.

44:48.597 --> 44:50.216
As you wish.

45:32.370 --> 45:35.162
Maggie!

45:37.775 --> 45:40.292
I can not believe,
is anyone there?

46:57.204 --> 46:59.919
Just do not panic.

46:59.999 --> 47:01.270
There must be another way.

47:01.305 --> 47:02.723
There is always an opening somewhere else.

47:02.824 --> 47:05.180
God, do not panic,
do not panic.

47:33.945 --> 47:35.016
Fuck!

48:00.133 --> 48:01.956
Thank God.

48:04.804 --> 48:06.524
Ready, go.

48:30.559 --> 48:32.451
Sara?, Father?

48:32.761 --> 48:34.617
Professor Sara?

49:01.120 --> 49:02.567
Sara?

49:11.294 --> 49:13.550
Professor, what are you doing?

49:13.599 --> 49:15.182
Are you okay?

49:47.061 --> 49:48.536
Ronnie, are you okay?

49:48.571 --> 49:50.317
Ronnie, talk to me.

49:50.529 --> 49:53.014
- Ronnie?
- Maggie, thank God it's you.

49:53.099 --> 49:55.992
Ronnie, my God, you scared us.

49:56.402 --> 49:59.523
You find here and we think
you were having seizures.

49:59.604 --> 50:01.222
Do not know what to do.

50:01.706 --> 50:03.825
Sorry, do not know what happened.

50:04.207 --> 50:06.042
It is as if I had passed out.

50:06.077 --> 50:09.529
Nonsense, you have nothing
to apologize for.

50:09.782 --> 50:11.729
Fortunately, you're fine.

50:11.815 --> 50:13.365
All that matters.

50:14.084 --> 50:17.410
Must remain hydrated
with so much stress.

50:18.453 --> 50:20.038
Here.

50:20.490 --> 50:23.042
Drink water. All we drink.

50:23.727 --> 50:25.379
Hey...

50:25.661 --> 50:27.142
Slowly.

50:27.529 --> 50:29.113
We do not want you drown.

50:31.165 --> 50:32.749
Best?

50:33.400 --> 50:34.983
Yes.

50:37.470 --> 50:39.562
I had never been so
scared in my life.

50:40.741 --> 50:43.428
Alright now, you're with us.

50:46.913 --> 50:48.736
Where is Sara and her father?

50:48.981 --> 50:50.770
I do not know, they were not here.

50:51.081 --> 50:53.407
Why can not sit still?

50:53.819 --> 50:56.735
This is something that I wondered
all my life.

50:58.423 --> 50:59.966
Ok, so...

51:00.001 --> 51:01.510
What's the plan now?

51:01.992 --> 51:03.659
Keep looking.

51:03.694 --> 51:06.313
And we find this mysterious secret exit.

51:06.564 --> 51:08.318
Maybe there's a clue here.

51:08.832 --> 51:12.523
When you find them, we have to leave.

51:12.769 --> 51:14.888
We should not go to
actual burial chamber.

51:15.170 --> 51:17.893
- Of course.
- I'll take your word...

51:17.939 --> 51:20.696
I do not think your
father has the same goal.

51:20.809 --> 51:22.757
- Of course.
- Seriously?

53:45.049 --> 53:46.010
Oh no!

53:52.897 --> 53:54.368
Oh, come on!

54:05.551 --> 54:08.874
Maggie has problems,
there must be something in the air as...

54:08.909 --> 54:10.772
A microbacteria.

54:11.026 --> 54:12.180
And the more we are...

54:12.215 --> 54:14.443
Exposed, more likely to end...

54:16.263 --> 54:17.813
Dying.

55:26.492 --> 55:27.839
Hello?

55:28.942 --> 55:30.563
Professor?

55:32.229 --> 55:34.815
Hello?

55:35.131 --> 55:36.614
Professor?

57:02.709 --> 57:04.361
Santa?

57:04.445 --> 57:05.911
Now what?

57:05.946 --> 57:08.224
- We take one of these passages.
- Father?

57:08.259 --> 57:10.037
- Just relax.
- Hey.

57:10.082 --> 57:11.837
- We parted?
- No.

57:12.283 --> 57:13.969
We must stick together.

57:19.997 --> 57:22.059
Come on, it's okay.
We will.

57:58.925 --> 58:00.291
Hey.

58:00.326 --> 58:02.012
What are you doing?

58:02.894 --> 58:04.376
I dont know.

58:06.798 --> 58:08.348
I can not go there.

58:08.400 --> 58:10.729
Nothing will happen, you should only
is therefore dragging

58:10.764 --> 58:12.285
turns into a large tunnel.

58:12.904 --> 58:14.692
Come on, Maggie is ahead.

58:15.472 --> 58:17.295
I'll help it go, alright.

58:46.132 --> 58:48.924
Shit, there is no escape.

58:54.239 --> 58:55.721
Wait...

58:55.774 --> 58:57.323
Feel that?

59:00.278 --> 59:01.828
The fresh air.

59:49.989 --> 59:51.607
My God, we did it.

59:51.690 --> 59:52.721
We could.

59:54.097 --> 59:55.016
Oh, my God!

01:00:00.998 --> 01:00:02.874
Now we have to seek help.

01:00:02.909 --> 01:00:04.750
Maybe we could go back to the village.

01:00:04.801 --> 01:00:06.400
You go on without me.

01:00:06.435 --> 01:00:08.663
- What?
- I gotta get back in there.

01:00:08.698 --> 01:00:10.088
Trying to find my father.

01:00:10.140 --> 01:00:13.232
Maggie, three of our
friends have died there.

01:00:13.267 --> 01:00:15.459
- It is very dangerous.
- I have to find it.

01:00:15.494 --> 01:00:17.098
Not. Maggie, please.

01:00:17.179 --> 01:00:18.763
You do not think clearly.

01:00:19.881 --> 01:00:21.328
Yes, I think.

01:00:21.382 --> 01:00:24.008
Ronnie, you can not control
all situations.

01:00:24.043 --> 01:00:25.734
This has nothing to do with control.

01:00:25.769 --> 01:00:27.186
It is common sense.

01:00:27.221 --> 01:00:29.967
Not Ronnie, control is all about you

01:00:30.002 --> 01:00:32.145
You control everything and everybody.

01:00:32.460 --> 01:00:33.941
Simply.

01:00:34.194 --> 01:00:37.214
Remember, in Washington,
when everyone left our project?

01:00:37.431 --> 01:00:39.315
It was not because it was too difficult.

01:00:39.350 --> 01:00:40.815
Was it because you were.

01:00:41.868 --> 01:00:43.267
Ronnie.

01:00:43.302 --> 01:00:44.749
You're my best friend.

01:00:44.803 --> 01:00:46.354
I love you like a sister.

01:00:46.972 --> 01:00:48.699
You know I'd do anything for you.

01:00:48.734 --> 01:00:50.349
But sometimes...

01:00:50.384 --> 01:00:51.965
You need to let go.

01:01:00.150 --> 01:01:01.734
I'm sorry, but...

01:01:01.885 --> 01:01:04.905
I'm staying here, there is no
way to go again

01:01:25.239 --> 01:01:26.755
Maggie.

01:02:47.276 --> 01:02:49.099
Ronnie, where are you?

01:02:50.213 --> 01:02:51.379
Ronnie?

01:02:51.414 --> 01:02:53.067
Ronnie, are you okay?

01:02:53.617 --> 01:02:55.133
Down here.

01:02:55.417 --> 01:02:56.968
Are you okay?

01:02:58.888 --> 01:03:01.109
Yes, I think so.

01:03:01.757 --> 01:03:03.739
Do not think I've broken anything.

01:03:04.192 --> 01:03:05.878
Is there a way out?

01:03:09.531 --> 01:03:11.820
No, I think not.

01:03:17.275 --> 01:03:18.441
Oh, my God!

01:03:18.839 --> 01:03:20.204
- Oh, my God!
- What?

01:03:20.239 --> 01:03:22.631
It is a type of burial room.

01:03:25.446 --> 01:03:27.768
Maggie, do not leave me here.

01:03:27.846 --> 01:03:29.447
I do not want to die here.

01:03:29.482 --> 01:03:31.465
You will not, I swear.

01:03:31.717 --> 01:03:33.517
Wait a minute.

01:03:33.552 --> 01:03:35.375
I'll find one for you.

01:05:48.303 --> 01:05:50.216
Magnifico, right?

01:05:50.251 --> 01:05:51.685
Father.

01:05:51.720 --> 01:05:53.119
Oh, my God!

01:05:54.542 --> 01:05:56.375
I can not believe it's you?

01:05:56.410 --> 01:05:58.826
- Are you okay?
- Of course I do, dear.

01:05:59.313 --> 01:06:01.025
I thought I would not see you.

01:06:01.060 --> 01:06:02.530
Of course.

01:06:38.849 --> 01:06:42.471
Maggie!

01:06:43.085 --> 01:06:44.840
Maggie, back please.

01:06:44.919 --> 01:06:46.503
Let's go.

01:06:48.057 --> 01:06:50.277
See Maggie, the Nameless

01:06:50.924 --> 01:06:53.945
Tara, daughter of the sun.

01:06:54.863 --> 01:06:57.083
Monarch of the North and South.

01:06:57.597 --> 01:06:59.147
Queen of Egypt.

01:07:17.331 --> 01:07:19.387
Maggie!
Oh, my God!

01:07:19.588 --> 01:07:21.796
Maggie!
Oh, my God!

01:07:22.794 --> 01:07:24.927
Maggie, please help me!

01:07:43.564 --> 01:07:45.851
Maggie, help me!

01:07:45.852 --> 01:07:47.057
Oh, my God!

01:07:48.267 --> 01:07:49.482
Maggie!

01:07:50.249 --> 01:07:52.883
Help, help me!

01:08:21.571 --> 01:08:24.794
My God, we're in trouble,
should go.

01:08:25.541 --> 01:08:27.341
Silence, dear.

01:08:27.376 --> 01:08:28.995
- Do not worry.
- Please.

01:08:29.245 --> 01:08:32.264
Please, Ronnie is in danger,
we have to go.

01:08:33.014 --> 01:08:34.926
Please, we're in trouble.

01:08:35.014 --> 01:08:37.314
You have to help me now,
she will die.

01:09:26.895 --> 01:09:28.515
Will you kill me?

01:09:44.176 --> 01:09:47.901
Without you, none of this
would have been possible.

01:10:45.998 --> 01:10:48.862
Now, my queen.

01:12:23.144 --> 01:12:31.144
The Resurrected Mummy
