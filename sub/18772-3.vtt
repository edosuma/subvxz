01:41.197 --> 01:43.694
Temari... How close is it?

01:47.320 --> 01:49.902
Very close. He is right there.

01:49.903 --> 01:52.257
Shit. What should we do?

01:52.258 --> 01:55.299
Leave it to me.

02:28.735 --> 02:30.981
They do some fine work.

02:32.733 --> 02:34.216
What is that sound?

02:36.624 --> 02:41.476
An Explosion. It's probably a trap made for Sasuke.

02:41.477 --> 02:44.955
I wonder if Sasuke-kun is all right.

02:44.956 --> 02:50.408
There's no need to worry. He won't get knocked out so easily.

02:51.873 --> 02:53.886
It'd be fine if that were the truth.

03:02.856 --> 03:05.717
Well then... shall we get things started now?

03:05.718 --> 03:11.714
but before that, I need you two to return to your true forms.

03:11.715 --> 03:16.331
Be prepared, Sarutobi-Sensei.

03:17.272 --> 03:23.173
Nothing at the same level even now and then!
A fight at the level of Hokage

04:04.231 --> 04:10.692
The life is coming back to their faces quickly. What is that Jutsu?

04:11.201 --> 04:12.853
It's Edo Tensei....

04:12.853 --> 04:18.096
It's a forbidden Kuchiyose (Summoning) to
bring back the dead to this world again.

04:19.543 --> 04:24.510
Normally, Kuchiyose uses the Jutsusha's
(Jutsu performer) blood as its cost.

04:26.052 --> 04:31.586
But I heard that this jutsu, in order
to summon and to keep the soul of dead

04:31.587 --> 04:37.120
in this world, you must sacrifice a living
person's body as a container for the soul.

04:37.897 --> 04:41.791
Then, those two bodies are ones from a sacrifice?

04:41.792 --> 04:52.173
Yeah, and probably the sacrificed bodies are covered
by dust from the remains of the summoned souls.

04:52.174 --> 05:01.588
And the label put into their head kills the personality
of the summoned souls and makes them just killing dolls.

05:04.250 --> 05:06.727
All done.

05:06.728 --> 05:11.858
You two are just as I remembered...

05:11.859 --> 05:19.639
Do you know the sense of fulfillment and joy from
hurting a person whom you once called a teacher?

05:19.640 --> 05:28.030
I've prepared this stage for you to feel the joy. So, please enjoy it.

05:52.752 --> 06:01.601
Hokage-sama, even if their body and faces are
same, they are not the true First and Second!

06:03.425 --> 06:04.650
I know that!

06:22.569 --> 06:23.924
I'm coming!

06:25.600 --> 06:27.165
Katon Karyu Endan 
(Fire Element Stream of Fire Bullets)

06:51.121 --> 06:53.058
Suiton Suijin Heki 
(Water Element Water Wall)

06:59.712 --> 07:06.102
You've got to be kidding me!
Creating that much water in place with no water!

07:06.103 --> 07:08.459
Unbelievable!

07:15.256 --> 07:18.782
That's a former Hokage for sure.

07:22.479 --> 07:24.436
Suiton Suishoha
(Water Element Water Wave)

07:35.349 --> 07:37.095
Doton Doryu Heki
(Earth Element Mud Wall)

08:42.655 --> 08:45.475
I see you still have your Herculean type of strength.

08:54.949 --> 08:59.888
It sure is tough to fight against these two.

09:41.181 --> 09:45.114
This is bad... that is the secret Jutsu that only the First knows.

09:47.390 --> 09:52.689
Mokuton Hijutsu
(Wood Element Secret jutsu)

09:54.717 --> 09:56.125
Jukai Koutan
(Birth of the Woods)

10:39.335 --> 10:41.297
Chakara is a resource of life.

10:43.115 --> 10:50.227
Amazing! That is the legendary Mokuton Ninjutsu of the
First, who ruled during the wars and founded Konoha.

10:54.721 --> 10:59.344
You finally got caught, Sensei.

11:12.914 --> 11:14.883
All right, everybody is here.

11:15.479 --> 11:18.665
Everybody keep it moving.

11:23.215 --> 11:25.598
Be calm and don't rush.

11:25.599 --> 11:31.831
Konohamaru-chan, what's wrong? Does your stomach hurt?

11:34.324 --> 11:36.635
It's not that.

11:51.783 --> 11:57.326
Ninpo Kuchiyose. Come out, Enko Enma (Monkey King, Enma)!

12:13.506 --> 12:17.678
A troublesome one came out...

12:20.641 --> 12:24.681
Old monkey, Enma.

12:31.743 --> 12:36.739
Orochimaru... It's just as I guessed.

12:38.067 --> 12:42.584
You're pathetic, Sarutobi. This is because you didn't kill him then.

12:43.017 --> 12:44.965
Well, I'll do it from now.

12:44.966 --> 12:47.777
It's too late.
