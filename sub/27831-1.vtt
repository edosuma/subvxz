00:15.724 --> 00:16.558
I...

00:19.019 --> 00:20.645
have always liked you, Ayumi.

00:24.190 --> 00:26.192
<i>A confession from the one I love.</i>

00:27.694 --> 00:28.862
Go out with me.

00:33.116 --> 00:33.950
Okay.

00:34.367 --> 00:37.662
<i>I was so happy, I forgot to breathe.</i>

01:02.437 --> 01:03.271
<i>But...</i>

01:04.147 --> 01:06.483
<i>I didn't understand anything at all.</i>

01:11.154 --> 01:12.363
<i>I had no idea...</i>

01:13.531 --> 01:15.658
<i>exactly how important that happiness was.</i>

01:31.591 --> 01:32.425
It's gone!

01:32.509 --> 01:34.344
It's not here! It's gone!

01:35.261 --> 01:37.680
-What's wrong?
-The necklace I left here!

01:46.564 --> 01:48.358
Dating at 16 years old...

01:48.608 --> 01:51.319
-Here.
-She's too young!

01:51.736 --> 01:52.570
Thank you.

02:03.665 --> 02:04.791
Your first date.

02:04.874 --> 02:06.292
Have a wonderful time.

02:07.293 --> 02:08.128
Thanks.

02:08.670 --> 02:09.796
See you later.

02:10.880 --> 02:17.137
<i>An outstanding illusion reflecting terrain</i>
<i>and light will appear midday today.</i>

02:17.220 --> 02:20.598
<i>Unique to this town, it is a sensation</i>
<i>known as the Red Moon.</i>

02:35.196 --> 02:37.824
UNKNOWN CALLER

02:45.415 --> 02:46.249
Hello?

02:47.750 --> 02:48.585
This is...

02:51.421 --> 02:53.548
your classmate, Umine.

02:55.717 --> 02:56.885
Zenko Umine.

02:56.968 --> 02:57.802
Umine?

02:58.970 --> 03:00.346
-What's wrong?
-I am...

03:01.097 --> 03:02.724
going to kill myself.

03:05.018 --> 03:06.019
I'm going to die!

03:10.440 --> 03:11.649
What are you saying?

03:12.650 --> 03:13.735
You're joking, right?

03:17.030 --> 03:18.364
Look behind you.

03:32.253 --> 03:33.254
Umine?!

03:36.341 --> 03:37.884
I'm coming so stay there!

03:37.967 --> 03:39.135
No!

03:39.761 --> 03:41.638
Stand there and watch.

04:00.823 --> 04:02.158
Umine...

04:02.575 --> 04:04.702
if you stand there, you might actually--

04:52.041 --> 04:52.875
<i>Heavy...</i>

04:54.585 --> 04:56.087
<i>My eyelids, my body...</i>

04:56.921 --> 04:58.631
<i>feel as heavy as lead.</i>

05:05.763 --> 05:08.141
<i>What happened to me?</i>

05:11.561 --> 05:12.562
Are you awake?

05:14.981 --> 05:18.234
We didn't find any major injuries.
Do you feel pain anywhere?

05:19.569 --> 05:20.403
No.

05:26.367 --> 05:27.327
Thank you.

05:29.662 --> 05:31.622
That's right. What happened to Umine?

05:32.749 --> 05:34.208
Is Umine okay?!

05:35.585 --> 05:36.961
What are you talking about?

05:37.378 --> 05:38.963
Ms. Umine is you.

05:40.423 --> 05:41.257
Huh?

05:42.133 --> 05:43.593
I'll call the doctor.

06:18.920 --> 06:19.879
What's happening?

06:21.506 --> 06:22.590
How are you feeling?

06:22.673 --> 06:23.549
Doctor!

06:26.928 --> 06:27.929
Are you okay?

06:28.262 --> 06:29.680
Doctor, please...

06:29.764 --> 06:31.265
what happened to me?!

06:31.349 --> 06:32.475
Where is my body?!

06:32.558 --> 06:34.394
Please calm down, Ms. Umine.

06:34.644 --> 06:36.854
I am not Umine!

06:36.938 --> 06:38.439
Zenko!

06:38.981 --> 06:40.733
Stop being a nuisance!

06:42.068 --> 06:42.902
Please accept...

06:42.985 --> 06:44.946
my deepest apologies!

06:45.947 --> 06:47.698
You apologize, too!

06:47.782 --> 06:50.284
She seems confused
from the sudden shock.

06:50.368 --> 06:52.578
If you give her a minute,
she will calm down.

06:52.870 --> 06:54.247
She has no injuries...

06:54.330 --> 06:57.500
<i>What in the world is happening?</i>

07:53.181 --> 07:54.015
I'm not really--

07:54.932 --> 07:56.017
I left work for you.

07:56.684 --> 07:58.478
Do not cause me any more problems!

08:14.660 --> 08:17.038
<i>The person in front of my eyes is not me.</i>

08:21.501 --> 08:22.335
<i>But...</i>

08:23.294 --> 08:26.088
<i>the person inside was undoubtedly me.</i>

09:24.772 --> 09:26.232
Rock, paper, scissors!

09:26.983 --> 09:28.317
One more time!

09:28.985 --> 09:30.486
One more time!

09:30.945 --> 09:32.488
Koshiro loses!

09:34.156 --> 09:35.157
Get going! Come back soon!

09:36.742 --> 09:38.619
-Enough already.
-See ya!

09:40.288 --> 09:41.163
Strawberry milk?

09:41.497 --> 09:44.834
How many times has Ayumi told you
that she likes hot drinks?

09:46.252 --> 09:47.086
Oh yeah.

09:47.628 --> 09:49.505
-I'll get something else.
-It's okay.

09:49.589 --> 09:50.840
I love strawberry.

09:51.090 --> 09:52.383
-Thanks.
-Oh, fine then.

09:52.508 --> 09:53.843
Give it here.

09:55.261 --> 09:56.095
Ah! It's cold. Now then.

09:57.597 --> 09:58.848
Cheers!

10:02.643 --> 10:03.561
It's so cold!

10:04.061 --> 10:05.605
I'm getting a brain freeze!

10:05.730 --> 10:06.564
Sorry.

10:06.772 --> 10:09.150
That's why I told you to get a hot--

10:09.692 --> 10:10.610
That scared me!

10:13.362 --> 10:14.196
Ah! That's cold!

10:14.864 --> 10:15.865
Don't do that.

10:52.068 --> 10:54.779
HANG THE CLOTHES OUT TO DRY

11:22.390 --> 11:23.265
Mom.

11:25.893 --> 11:26.727
Mom!

11:27.645 --> 11:28.729
It's me.

11:29.063 --> 11:30.564
I'm Ayumi! Are you Ayumi's friend?

11:35.695 --> 11:36.737
No, that's not it!

11:36.946 --> 11:38.072
I am Ayumi.

11:46.580 --> 11:47.581
Mom...

11:48.290 --> 11:50.126
please help me.

11:50.918 --> 11:52.211
Mom.

11:54.380 --> 11:55.506
I'm sorry.

12:04.807 --> 12:06.308
Please excuse me.

12:34.003 --> 12:34.837
Ayumi.

12:43.596 --> 12:44.680
Koshiro.

12:55.357 --> 12:56.233
Koshiro.

12:57.693 --> 12:58.652
Good morning.

13:12.792 --> 13:13.626
Who is that?

13:16.712 --> 13:17.755
Who are you?!

13:26.972 --> 13:27.807
Who...

13:29.266 --> 13:30.643
Who are you?

13:34.855 --> 13:35.940
Are you Umine?

13:36.023 --> 13:36.941
What?

13:37.107 --> 13:38.776
You are Umine, aren't you?

13:38.859 --> 13:40.903
-Hey...
-Don't you remember yesterday?

13:40.986 --> 13:42.863
We switched places, didn't we?

13:42.947 --> 13:45.825
-Stop Umine. You're getting too excited.
-Kaga...

13:45.950 --> 13:46.951
You're acting weird.

13:47.785 --> 13:49.370
I'm telling you, that's not it.

13:54.083 --> 13:55.793
Did something happen between you?

13:56.502 --> 13:57.336
I don't know.

13:59.004 --> 13:59.839
Hey.

14:00.297 --> 14:01.131
Let's go.

14:07.054 --> 14:08.180
Wait a minute.

14:08.973 --> 14:09.807
Ritsu.

14:10.307 --> 14:11.267
Maria.

14:11.684 --> 14:12.685
-I am--
-Hey,

14:12.768 --> 14:14.228
what's with you this morning?

14:14.645 --> 14:16.146
You're being a pest.

14:16.230 --> 14:17.189
In any case,

14:17.273 --> 14:18.983
Stay away from Ayumi.

14:34.081 --> 14:37.084
Okay, here it says, "These factors." Who can tell me what that's referring to?

14:41.338 --> 14:42.172
Umine!

14:44.258 --> 14:45.801
U-mi-ne!

14:48.053 --> 14:49.513
U-mi-ne!

14:53.309 --> 14:54.143
Me?

14:54.226 --> 14:55.853
Why is your head in the clouds?

14:56.353 --> 14:58.898
You've got a full stomach,
but an empty head.

15:04.653 --> 15:05.487
<i>What?</i>

15:07.114 --> 15:09.074
-Okay everyone, pair up!
-Yes, sir.

15:09.742 --> 15:11.160
Ayumi, want to be partners?

15:11.535 --> 15:12.369
Sure.

15:12.661 --> 15:13.829
What's with that smile?

15:13.913 --> 15:15.623
Face your partner, and stretch!

15:17.166 --> 15:19.460
<i>School is exactly the same, and yet...</i>

15:21.253 --> 15:22.546
What is that?

15:22.755 --> 15:24.840
Yum! It's really good!

15:32.848 --> 15:35.517
<i>It's like I was living</i>
<i>in an unknown world.</i>

15:39.688 --> 15:40.856
Oh, Umine,

15:40.940 --> 15:42.942
please bring up the schoolwork
after class.

15:43.025 --> 15:45.444
It's a lot for one person,
so have someone help.

15:46.195 --> 15:47.363
Everyone stand.

15:49.114 --> 15:49.949
Bow.

15:51.075 --> 15:52.409
Okay, dismissed.

15:52.785 --> 15:53.911
Be careful.

16:14.598 --> 16:15.891
<i>Umine was...</i>

16:18.936 --> 16:20.896
<i>probably always alone.</i>

16:23.899 --> 16:25.401
<i>We were in the same class,</i>

16:26.402 --> 16:28.112
<i>but I didn't notice her at all.</i>

16:33.617 --> 16:34.535
Umine?

16:40.624 --> 16:41.500
I'll help you.

16:41.834 --> 16:43.252
It's too hard by yourself. Koshiro...

16:46.755 --> 16:47.673
By the way...

16:48.632 --> 16:50.009
What happened this morning?

16:52.011 --> 16:53.345
Something happened, right?

16:58.726 --> 16:59.560
Umine?

17:12.781 --> 17:14.283
I'll take this box.

17:16.368 --> 17:17.494
Wait!

17:28.213 --> 17:29.048
I am...

17:32.384 --> 17:34.178
Ayumi Kohinata.

17:36.597 --> 17:37.431
What?

17:38.766 --> 17:39.975
I'm not lying.

17:40.976 --> 17:42.686
I don't know why it happened.

17:42.811 --> 17:44.563
But just before our date yesterday,

17:44.646 --> 17:46.356
Umine jumped from a building,

17:46.440 --> 17:49.276
and now my mind is stuck in her body--

17:49.359 --> 17:50.194
Hang on.

17:51.195 --> 17:53.697
-I don't understand--
-It's true. Please believe me.

17:54.114 --> 17:56.116
I could tell you all our memories.

17:56.200 --> 17:59.161
I remember every word
when you told me you liked me.

18:00.412 --> 18:04.083
You called me into another classroom
to say you've always liked me.

18:04.166 --> 18:05.000
I'm sorry!

18:09.546 --> 18:11.423
If I got your hopes up, I apologize.

18:16.970 --> 18:18.388
I'll carry this.

18:36.406 --> 18:38.450
I am not Umine!

18:40.202 --> 18:42.037
Do not cause me anymore problems!

18:46.375 --> 18:48.502
Are you Ayumi's friend?

18:49.211 --> 18:50.379
I'm sorry.

18:53.090 --> 18:54.049
You're acting weird.

18:56.009 --> 18:58.887
You've got a full stomach,
but an empty head.

19:06.061 --> 19:07.938
I don't understand.

19:08.105 --> 19:10.023
If I got your hopes up, I apologize.

19:27.249 --> 19:28.792
I can't take this anymore.

19:31.587 --> 19:32.963
I want to go back.

19:35.924 --> 19:38.051
I want to go back to how things were.

19:41.138 --> 19:42.264
Are you okay?

20:01.992 --> 20:03.202
It's rough, isn't it?

20:04.369 --> 20:05.787
Being in my body.

20:07.497 --> 20:08.665
Umine.

20:10.667 --> 20:12.419
You are Umine, aren't you?

20:14.463 --> 20:15.297
Yeah.

20:15.756 --> 20:18.175
Did anyone believe you were Umine?

20:19.092 --> 20:20.260
No one did, right?

20:21.178 --> 20:23.639
I don't know how this happened,

20:23.722 --> 20:26.850
but we need to convince
our friends and family

20:26.934 --> 20:28.977
that we've switched bodies.

20:29.937 --> 20:33.190
If we tell them together,
then they'll definitely believe us.

20:36.443 --> 20:37.277
Right?

20:42.241 --> 20:43.784
As if I'd do that.

20:47.454 --> 20:48.622
Because...

20:49.706 --> 20:51.667
I've always wanted to be you, Kohinata.

20:52.876 --> 20:53.752
Umine...

20:54.670 --> 20:56.046
What are you saying?

21:00.050 --> 21:02.719
Looking at every angle from here...

21:04.721 --> 21:07.057
I truly am hideous.

21:13.313 --> 21:14.773
You can have my body now.

21:20.320 --> 21:22.531
Starting today, I will be Ayumi Kohinata,

21:23.490 --> 21:25.450
and you will be Zenko Umine.

21:26.285 --> 21:27.286
I don't want that!

21:27.369 --> 21:29.454
But no one believed you, right?

21:34.584 --> 21:35.419
That's right.

21:37.963 --> 21:40.632
No matter how much
I struggled in that body...

21:43.218 --> 21:45.304
my words never reached anyone.

21:49.349 --> 21:51.560
No one ever believed me.

21:59.318 --> 22:02.612
You've already lived happily enough.

22:02.863 --> 22:04.656
How about you struggle for once?

22:15.584 --> 22:16.418
Wait.

22:22.591 --> 22:23.842
Why?

22:25.927 --> 22:28.055
Why did you want to be me?

22:33.101 --> 22:33.977
That's because...

22:36.813 --> 22:38.565
you had something I wanted.

22:41.610 --> 22:42.569
What?

22:50.160 --> 22:51.078
Koshiro.

23:25.987 --> 23:28.657
He's at the top of the class
and a basketball star.

23:28.824 --> 23:31.535
Ayumi's childhood friend sure is
a step above the rest.

23:31.993 --> 23:33.995
They're not childhood friends anymore.

23:34.246 --> 23:36.540
Oh yeah. Now he's your boyfriend!

23:37.582 --> 23:38.625
So how does it feel,

23:39.084 --> 23:41.503
to finally be with him
after years of longing?

23:46.883 --> 23:48.135
I'm really glad.

23:49.845 --> 23:51.346
Of course you are!

23:51.430 --> 23:53.098
It must be so nice.

24:10.949 --> 24:11.908
What's wrong?

24:13.160 --> 24:15.370
You can't go home anymore?

24:18.498 --> 24:19.708
In that case,

24:20.375 --> 24:22.127
you're the same as me.

24:23.378 --> 24:26.590
<i>If no one noticed</i>
<i>that I was stuck like this,</i>

24:27.757 --> 24:29.551
<i>then my family, my friends,</i>

24:30.135 --> 24:34.347
<i>and Koshiro would be taken by Umine.</i>

24:35.307 --> 24:36.349
<i>It scared me</i>

24:37.434 --> 24:39.561
<i>just thinking about it.</i>

24:41.104 --> 24:44.191
PARAKEET FOUND

24:49.696 --> 24:51.281
I need to do something.

24:55.452 --> 24:57.454
CLASS RANKINGS

24:58.121 --> 25:00.832
You're first again, Mizumoto?!
I even took extra tests.

25:00.916 --> 25:03.460
-It's because you don't study.
-I don't have time!

25:05.504 --> 25:06.588
It's gonna hatch!

25:06.671 --> 25:07.506
Kaga.

25:08.089 --> 25:10.175
Wanna know an easy way to make time?

25:10.258 --> 25:11.092
Yeah!

25:11.218 --> 25:12.260
Stop playing games.

25:12.344 --> 25:14.012
It hatched! I got a super rare one!

25:14.095 --> 25:16.431
Koshiro! Look!

25:16.515 --> 25:17.432
Hey, Koshiro!

25:17.516 --> 25:18.725
Perfect timing, guys.

25:18.808 --> 25:21.436
We just decided will be
the school festival captain.

25:21.520 --> 25:22.604
Our leader.

25:22.687 --> 25:25.815
-And?
-The captain for class two is...

25:26.858 --> 25:27.984
Kaga!

25:39.037 --> 25:40.330
Thank you!

25:40.413 --> 25:42.249
Ever since I was a young boy,

25:42.332 --> 25:43.875
I've dreamed of being captain.

25:47.712 --> 25:48.588
You idiots!

25:49.589 --> 25:51.508
What a burden. Koshiro, you do it.

25:54.386 --> 25:55.845
All right!

26:01.643 --> 26:03.603
KAGA

26:04.312 --> 26:05.272
Hey!

26:06.064 --> 26:08.108
Okay, it's settled!

26:11.069 --> 26:13.613
You'll all be getting a bill for my fees!

26:14.698 --> 26:16.908
Why do I have to be captain?

26:25.250 --> 26:26.918
Ayumi, you should play the ghost!

26:27.794 --> 26:29.796
We need someone pretty
who won't get scared!

26:31.047 --> 26:32.632
But I'm not really pretty--

26:34.301 --> 26:36.553
You're the cutest in the class. Right? I want to see Ayumi in a kimono!

26:39.472 --> 26:41.474
You want to see it, right?

26:48.148 --> 26:49.399
Please do it!

26:51.318 --> 26:52.819
What are you talking about?

27:00.952 --> 27:03.246
STAGE CREW

27:03.330 --> 27:05.498
MIZUMOTO

27:15.842 --> 27:16.926
<i>Koshiro.</i>

27:17.844 --> 27:19.054
<i>Please,</i>

27:19.429 --> 27:21.056
<i>notice me.</i>

27:22.098 --> 27:26.227
<i>UMINE, MIZUMOTO</i>

27:32.567 --> 27:35.236
-You're working hard, Captain.
-I'll be busy the day of.

27:37.197 --> 27:38.823
Actually, I need a favor.

28:10.438 --> 28:11.439
Koshiro!

28:12.524 --> 28:13.358
He's not coming. What?

28:14.359 --> 28:15.860
He wanted to do something else.

28:17.320 --> 28:18.279
Umine,

28:18.780 --> 28:20.115
do you like Koshiro?

28:20.281 --> 28:21.116
What?

28:22.534 --> 28:24.452
He has a girlfriend. Give it up.

28:25.995 --> 28:26.913
<i>I am...</i>

28:29.207 --> 28:30.250
<i>his girlfriend.</i>

28:50.895 --> 28:51.813
Am I...

28:52.480 --> 28:54.107
really that strange?

28:54.232 --> 28:55.066
Yeah.

28:57.610 --> 28:58.653
Man, that's awful!

28:59.362 --> 29:00.196
What? What is that?

29:02.449 --> 29:03.408
It's a kappa.

29:04.159 --> 29:05.452
It's not scary at all.

29:05.535 --> 29:07.162
How rude! I did the best I could.

29:07.245 --> 29:08.246
Sorry.

29:09.122 --> 29:10.790
But this is just as bad as hers.

29:11.875 --> 29:14.169
-Hers?
-The girl I like is a bad artist.

29:14.836 --> 29:16.337
-What?!
-You like someone?

29:16.421 --> 29:17.297
-Since when?
-Relax!

29:17.380 --> 29:19.340
So you've been hiding this from me?

29:22.343 --> 29:23.470
Who is it?

29:23.553 --> 29:25.138
-I'm not telling.
-Do I know her?

29:25.221 --> 29:27.265
-Gimme the brush!
-Got it! It's Maria!

29:27.724 --> 29:29.601
-She's really cute.
-Brush!

29:29.684 --> 29:31.603
-Or maybe Ritsu!
-Stop it.

29:41.529 --> 29:42.739
I'm a kappa?!

29:48.620 --> 29:49.746
Quit laughing!

29:49.829 --> 29:51.372
-Help me out.
-Sorry, sorry.

29:52.081 --> 29:53.291
Thank you.

29:57.128 --> 29:58.213
Sheesh.

30:05.053 --> 30:07.138
It feels like the first time in a while.

30:07.472 --> 30:08.306
Huh?

30:09.474 --> 30:10.850
Chatting like this.

30:10.934 --> 30:12.602
'Cause you don't have many friends.

30:14.103 --> 30:14.979
Yeah.

30:28.952 --> 30:31.621
They were surrounded
at the famous Battle of Gaixia,

30:31.704 --> 30:34.791
and in the early morning hours,
they heard the Chus' song...

30:39.379 --> 30:41.130
That looks like crap.

30:42.882 --> 30:45.051
You don't need to laugh at me.

30:45.385 --> 30:46.469
KAGA This is mine!

30:51.516 --> 30:52.892
And you wrote it in pen!

30:52.976 --> 30:53.935
I don't know.

30:54.018 --> 30:54.853
You two!

30:55.186 --> 30:56.813
Stop disturbing class!

30:58.481 --> 30:59.691
I'm sorry.

31:10.785 --> 31:11.953
Kaga.

31:12.662 --> 31:14.330
You look a little gross.

31:15.456 --> 31:17.292
You were thinking about your crush!

31:17.375 --> 31:18.418
Oh, shut up.

31:21.170 --> 31:23.631
I'll go ask the class to buy supplies.

31:24.132 --> 31:24.966
Okay.

31:26.092 --> 31:27.093
Hang on a minute.

31:49.365 --> 31:50.241
What is it?

31:54.495 --> 31:55.705
Order yellow paint, too.

31:56.456 --> 31:58.082
Okay. Got it.

32:03.046 --> 32:04.964
Maybe I do play too many games.

32:21.272 --> 32:22.523
Ritsu, Maria.

32:23.232 --> 32:24.359
Could you buy these?

32:25.860 --> 32:27.487
Ask the accounting group first.

32:30.823 --> 32:31.908
Oh, you're right.

32:33.952 --> 32:34.953
By the way...

32:38.539 --> 32:40.375
can you not talk to us like friends?

32:41.209 --> 32:43.252
We were never friends to start.

32:54.931 --> 32:55.932
Sorry.

33:04.941 --> 33:05.900
Excuse me...

33:08.444 --> 33:10.113
I'd like someone to buy this.

33:10.196 --> 33:11.280
Leave it over there.

33:33.261 --> 33:34.971
THINGS TO BUY

33:45.523 --> 33:46.482
There it is!

33:47.358 --> 33:48.234
KAGA

34:09.881 --> 34:10.923
I need a favor.

34:11.758 --> 34:13.342
Could you do stage crew for me?

34:14.052 --> 34:17.430
I want to put some space
between me and Umine.

34:17.972 --> 34:21.059
-Did something happen with her?
-I don't really get it, either.

34:21.309 --> 34:22.769
-Huh?
-Umine...

34:23.144 --> 34:25.855
believes that she is Ayumi.

34:28.941 --> 34:31.027
We switched places didn't we?

34:31.110 --> 34:32.236
You're acting weird.

34:36.991 --> 34:37.992
That's impossible.

34:40.661 --> 34:43.081
Now presenting our ghost!

35:01.891 --> 35:03.935
<i>I'm scared to go into the classroom.</i>

35:06.562 --> 35:08.106
<i>Their eyes scare me.</i>

35:13.611 --> 35:15.863
<i>I only look different.</i>

35:17.907 --> 35:19.659
<i>I'm still me.</i>

35:21.828 --> 35:22.829
<i>But why...</i>

35:32.421 --> 35:35.299
It's not like you to isolate Umine!

35:35.383 --> 35:36.717
She got what she deserved.

35:37.093 --> 35:39.262
She's been harassing Ayumi.

35:39.345 --> 35:40.179
Harass?

35:40.596 --> 35:44.642
Ayumi won't explain why,
but she doesn't want to be near Umine.

35:45.143 --> 35:46.352
If Ayumi says that,

35:46.727 --> 35:47.603
it must be big.

35:49.147 --> 35:50.565
Wait a minute.

35:50.648 --> 35:52.650
-I didn't do anything.
-Don't move.

35:53.442 --> 35:55.069
You followed Ayumi yesterday.

35:55.945 --> 35:56.779
Yes, but... What?

35:59.490 --> 36:02.827
-If you've got something to say, say it!
-It's just a misunderstanding!

36:03.703 --> 36:05.037
Ritsu, Maria.

36:07.415 --> 36:09.208
I'm fine.

36:12.628 --> 36:15.381
It's my fault for starting it.

36:16.841 --> 36:20.344
I didn't think about Umine's feelings

36:21.137 --> 36:23.723
and I started dating Koshiro anyway.

36:25.183 --> 36:27.226
Umine likes Koshiro?

36:37.278 --> 36:38.738
So that was it.

36:39.572 --> 36:41.073
You're the worst.

36:41.157 --> 36:42.408
No, that's not it.

36:44.076 --> 36:46.037
You've got it all wrong.

36:46.287 --> 36:48.331
People can like who they want, but...

36:48.414 --> 36:50.249
Poor Mizumoto!

36:50.333 --> 36:51.751
That's hilarious!

36:51.918 --> 36:52.919
Look in the mirror!

37:08.267 --> 37:10.186
She said it's a misunderstanding!

38:07.285 --> 38:08.119
Everyone...

38:10.079 --> 38:11.080
I'm sorry.

38:13.249 --> 38:14.542
I seemed to have...

38:15.584 --> 38:17.461
misunderstood Umine.

38:18.754 --> 38:19.672
Ayumi?

38:26.220 --> 38:27.054
Well.

38:27.805 --> 38:29.557
If that's the case,

38:30.433 --> 38:32.018
you owe Umine a proper apology.

38:38.441 --> 38:39.275
Come on. I'm...

38:55.583 --> 38:56.417
sorry. Kaga.

39:35.623 --> 39:37.541
Thanks for helping me earlier.

39:42.171 --> 39:43.631
I'll help, too.

39:44.507 --> 39:45.341
Ayumi.

39:50.346 --> 39:51.430
You are Ayumi, right?

39:59.939 --> 40:00.856
I'm sorry...

40:02.483 --> 40:03.943
for not realizing it sooner.

40:06.570 --> 40:07.696
How?

40:07.822 --> 40:09.615
No matter how you look, I'd know.

40:13.035 --> 40:14.036
Because you are...

40:16.455 --> 40:17.540
who you are.

40:46.527 --> 40:47.778
Kaga...

40:59.707 --> 41:00.749
Don't cry.

41:10.843 --> 41:13.220
<i>Thanks to Kaga...</i>

41:13.304 --> 41:15.097
Silly. I told you to stop crying.

41:15.848 --> 41:18.601
<i>It felt like my existence</i>
<i>on the verge of disappearing</i>

41:19.018 --> 41:20.853
<i>was being seen.</i>

41:37.870 --> 41:39.246
Do you want me...

41:40.498 --> 41:42.458
to tell Koshiro your secret?

41:43.417 --> 41:44.251
Zenko Umine.

42:11.529 --> 42:13.322
-It surprised me.
-Did it?

42:13.405 --> 42:14.365
What? This--

42:17.993 --> 42:18.827
<i>However...</i>

42:20.329 --> 42:21.747
<i>for Koshiro,</i>

42:23.374 --> 42:25.209
<i>his life might've been happier</i>

42:26.919 --> 42:28.837
<i>had he never known.</i>
