<i>- Previously on
"Million Dollar Listing:</i>

00:14.148 --> 00:15.247
<i>Los Angeles"...</i>

00:15.315 --> 00:17.115
- I do like to have two floors.

00:17.183 --> 00:18.250
I do like to have
that separation.

00:18.317 --> 00:20.019
- Oh, well, that, you're never
gonna get in Trousdale.

00:20.087 --> 00:22.188
- Yeah. Is this yours?

00:22.255 --> 00:23.722
- What would have taken us
normally 18 months

00:23.724 --> 00:26.625
took us 5 years
to simply build a new house.

00:27.761 --> 00:29.462
Let me show you around.

00:29.464 --> 00:31.196
<i>Carly thinks that she wants
to build her own house.</i>

00:31.264 --> 00:32.798
Huge mistake.

00:32.865 --> 00:36.201
- I still would be
interested in seeing lots.

00:36.269 --> 00:38.770
- Ooh, daddy's home.

00:38.772 --> 00:42.341
So 28.5, I can agree
as a listing price.

00:42.408 --> 00:44.877
- I want you and Josh
to be on the listing.

00:44.944 --> 00:47.079
Both of you.
- Oi, oi, oi.

00:47.081 --> 00:49.448
Are you ready for some video?
- Yeah.

00:49.515 --> 00:52.885
My husband, my kids, we eat
together every single night.

00:53.653 --> 00:57.489
- Dinner is served in your
new mansion at Beverly Park.

00:57.557 --> 00:59.158
<i>- Our styles couldn't
be more different.</i>

00:59.225 --> 01:00.426
- All right.
- Thank you for watching.

01:00.493 --> 01:02.494
See you soon.
- Let's go!

01:06.566 --> 01:09.668

01:09.735 --> 01:12.304
<i>♪ I'm working for

01:12.371 --> 01:13.372
- We gotta do a double date

01:13.374 --> 01:14.205
'cause I haven't seen
your husband in forever.

01:14.274 --> 01:16.842
- I know.
- We're having a nice lunch.

01:16.844 --> 01:19.911
What are you working on now?
- Um, a sixth child.

01:19.979 --> 01:21.581
- Wait, sixth child.
What are you talking about?

01:21.647 --> 01:22.647
- What?
- I'm just kidding.

01:22.715 --> 01:23.982
- Oh.
- I'm joking, I'm joking.

01:24.050 --> 01:25.450
- That's 45 months of your life,

01:25.518 --> 01:27.719
you had creatures in your body.

01:27.787 --> 01:29.789
- Or children, human beings.

01:33.393 --> 01:35.528

- Oh, sh--, I didn't--
- This is a very good game.

01:39.665 --> 01:42.402
The winner buys lunch.
How about that?

01:42.468 --> 01:45.271
I like your clever thinking,
but you lose, my good friend.

01:45.338 --> 01:48.107
Well, hang on. No, you have
to put the thing down.

01:48.174 --> 01:52.344
<i>- ♪ Ooh, ooh ♪</i>

01:54.714 --> 01:56.949
- I'm just happy
that my entire life

01:57.016 --> 01:58.049
I've worked up to a point

01:58.117 --> 02:00.185
where I've sold billions
of dollars of real estate.

02:00.187 --> 02:03.356
And now I'm literally just
driving Fredrik Eklund around.

02:03.422 --> 02:04.890
It's a really big moment for me.

02:04.957 --> 02:07.426
- It's also a big moment for me
because I sold

02:07.428 --> 02:09.362
billions and billions of
dollars and I've had a driver.

02:09.428 --> 02:11.863
And it's so nice to move to LA

02:11.865 --> 02:13.366
to be driven by Josh Altman.

02:13.432 --> 02:15.967
It's a real estate moment.
- Uber escrow.

02:16.035 --> 02:17.736
<i>- Listen, with 10 Beverly.</i>

02:21.808 --> 02:23.275
- Yeah, yeah. Of course.

02:23.277 --> 02:25.711
- Altman and I have been
working on a co-listing

02:25.713 --> 02:27.913
at 10 Beverly Park
for a few months now.

02:28.614 --> 02:30.382
- This orange,
it's really hard to--

02:30.449 --> 02:32.318
- No, but you have to see
through the orange.

02:32.385 --> 02:34.185
Close your eyes.
Feel it in your heart.

02:34.187 --> 02:35.320
- Um.

02:35.388 --> 02:37.189
- So you've got the gym,
the theater.

02:37.191 --> 02:38.991
The house actually
is pretty tricked out.

02:39.058 --> 02:41.126
- Tricked out?
- Yeah, tricked out.

02:41.628 --> 02:44.129
- We did all of these showings
and we searched, like,

02:44.197 --> 02:46.531
far away, international
for this buyer.

02:46.533 --> 02:48.667
And guess what?
The irony is a neighbor

02:48.669 --> 02:51.103
put in this offer,
and here we are.

02:51.105 --> 02:54.072
$22 million offer on 28.5.

02:54.140 --> 02:55.473
I don't think it's that bad.

02:55.541 --> 02:57.342
I mean, listen, he's not gonna
be happy about it.

02:57.410 --> 02:59.077
As long as we can get a counter,

02:59.145 --> 03:00.346
we can meet
somewhere in the middle.

03:00.413 --> 03:02.248
I think that's a fair number
for that house.

03:02.314 --> 03:04.215
- Yeah, I think,
before we make any moves

03:04.217 --> 03:05.550
'cause I know we spoke
about this before,

03:05.618 --> 03:08.019
it's like let's hear
his feedback

03:08.021 --> 03:10.256
and we'll go from there.
- I know.

03:10.322 --> 03:11.690
But we have to have
a unified front

03:11.758 --> 03:14.426
because we both agree
a deal can be made.

03:14.428 --> 03:16.228
- I do think it's
a good starting offer.

03:16.230 --> 03:17.629
- Yes.
- He's got to be realistic

03:17.631 --> 03:20.366
of the fact that everybody you
and I have shown the house to--

03:20.433 --> 03:22.368
- Always the same.
- Always.

03:22.435 --> 03:24.970
The house needs up
to $5 million.

03:25.037 --> 03:27.707
Most people have said either
major redo or gut, but it--

03:27.773 --> 03:30.075
- I mean, everybody would redo
that kitchen except you

03:30.142 --> 03:31.978
because you love orange,
apparently.

03:32.044 --> 03:33.912
- [laughs]

03:33.980 --> 03:35.380
<i>You can't ever have
too much color.</i>

03:35.448 --> 03:38.516
Suits, I got every color
in the rainbow.

03:38.584 --> 03:40.052
<i>And I mean, look,
people who know me know</i>

03:40.119 --> 03:42.722
I went to Syracuse University.
We were the orange men.

03:42.788 --> 03:46.057
So that kitchen, yeah,
maybe you change

03:46.059 --> 03:48.493
a couple things,
but you got to keep the orange.

03:54.166 --> 03:56.735
- All right, let's do this.

03:56.737 --> 03:57.535
- Yuri.

03:57.603 --> 03:58.803
- Let's go in.
- Yeah.

03:58.871 --> 04:01.072
- Come on, you first.
Age before beauty.

04:01.140 --> 04:02.275
- Hey.
- Hey!

04:02.341 --> 04:03.542
- Good to see you guys.
- How are you?

04:03.544 --> 04:04.609
- Good, good, good.
- Hi, buddy.

04:04.677 --> 04:05.711
- How are you?
- Yo, how's it going?

04:05.778 --> 04:07.946
Good? You having a good day?
- Yeah. Always, always.

04:08.014 --> 04:10.381
Every day is a good day.
You wake up. bam, good day.

04:10.450 --> 04:12.251
- That's it.
- Well, today is gonna be,

04:12.319 --> 04:13.552
I think, a really good day

04:13.554 --> 04:15.388
because we brought
a little gift for you.

04:15.454 --> 04:17.857
- Yeah? Want to sit down?
- Let's go sit down.

04:21.160 --> 04:23.496
Okay, guys. What do we have?

04:23.562 --> 04:25.364
- So we've done
a lot of showings.

04:25.431 --> 04:26.631
We've had, you know...
- Yeah.

04:26.699 --> 04:28.967
- About 15 qualified people

04:29.035 --> 04:31.436
that are ready and able
to cut a check

04:31.438 --> 04:32.937
that are looking in
this price range

04:33.005 --> 04:33.938
through here.
- Right.

04:34.006 --> 04:36.174
<i>- Fredrik and I have
very different styles.</i>

04:36.242 --> 04:39.177
So we split up the work and
we each did our own showings

04:39.179 --> 04:41.346
but the feedback was the same.

04:41.414 --> 04:43.348
- This is a little bit
1920s for me.

04:43.350 --> 04:45.450
- Every room needs renovating.

04:45.518 --> 04:46.586
- Paint?
- No.

04:46.652 --> 04:48.186
The whole darn thing's
got to go.

04:48.254 --> 04:50.356
- If I'm gonna spend
28 million plus,

04:50.422 --> 04:52.423
I do want it to be perfect.
- Mmm.

04:52.492 --> 04:54.226
- It's funky.
But you know what, man,

04:54.228 --> 04:55.393
she's gonna gut,
she's gonna gut.

04:55.461 --> 04:56.896
She guts everything.

04:56.962 --> 05:00.431
<i>- Some of these Beverly Park
houses are 25 years old,</i>

05:00.500 --> 05:02.133
so they do have to be renovated.

05:02.135 --> 05:03.869
- And it's always the same.
People love it.

05:03.936 --> 05:07.139
But they want modern.

05:07.206 --> 05:09.809
- We did finally get somebody
to write, which is great.

05:09.875 --> 05:12.311
And they came in at $22 million.

05:13.079 --> 05:16.681
- Again?
- 22. It's a starting offer.

05:16.749 --> 05:18.216
- Just starting.

05:18.284 --> 05:19.618
- It's the first offer.
- Okay.

05:19.620 --> 05:22.954
Well, the owners
are asking 28.5.

05:22.956 --> 05:24.323
- For sure.
And look, we understand,

05:24.391 --> 05:26.191
look, we saw
the buyer's bank statement.

05:26.193 --> 05:29.161
He's got enough money
to come up. That's for sure.

05:29.228 --> 05:30.595
- Sometimes you're gonna have to

05:30.597 --> 05:32.230
dance a little bit
with buyers, you know?

05:32.298 --> 05:33.231
They start somewhere
in their write,

05:33.299 --> 05:35.367
and that's why we're here
to talk out a strategy

05:35.434 --> 05:36.902
how far we can bring them up.

05:36.969 --> 05:39.371
- As far as I know,
the price is not negotiable.

05:40.207 --> 05:41.773
- 28.5 is not negotiable?

05:41.775 --> 05:43.642
- Not negotiable.
- But, Yuri, Yuri,

05:43.644 --> 05:46.111
we have spent
a lot of money and time

05:46.178 --> 05:48.347
and we've done over
15 showings, qualified buyers.

05:48.415 --> 05:51.049
The market is not agreeing
with 28.5.

05:51.117 --> 05:53.451
And all we're saying
is not to accept 22.

05:53.519 --> 05:54.920
But to start a conversation.

05:54.987 --> 05:57.989
You've got to come down from
your price, even if it's $1.

05:58.057 --> 06:00.658
- Like, Yuri, I believe
this offer is low.

06:00.726 --> 06:02.260
I believe it's low.
I totally understand

06:02.328 --> 06:03.662
how they want to stay firm.

06:03.664 --> 06:05.530
We all want to get
the deal done.

06:05.532 --> 06:07.532
But what if we approach it
a different way

06:07.534 --> 06:09.534
and we don't counter?

06:09.536 --> 06:11.136
What if we put our line
in the sand and say,

06:11.138 --> 06:12.737
"Look, we are real sellers.

06:12.739 --> 06:16.008
"We are willing and ready
and able to negotiate.

06:16.075 --> 06:19.010
"However, the starting point,
it's low.

06:19.012 --> 06:21.146
"You know, come back to us
with another offer.

06:21.213 --> 06:22.614
Let's skip the bullsh--"?

06:22.681 --> 06:24.282
What if we go that route?

06:24.350 --> 06:26.217
I don't think
we're gonna lose them.

06:26.953 --> 06:29.688
- When the seller brought up
this idea of a co-exclusive,

06:29.690 --> 06:32.824
actually forcing me to do it,
it's like "Ugh."

06:32.892 --> 06:34.893
I mean, this is why
I don't like co-exclusives

06:34.895 --> 06:36.962
because I'm not in full control,

06:37.029 --> 06:39.231
<i>which this just showed.
Altman just went on his own.</i>

06:39.298 --> 06:41.900
Like who am I?
Why am I even here?

06:41.902 --> 06:43.835
I wish we had
discussed this before.

06:43.837 --> 06:47.907
It's a--it's a route.
But it's a cool route, I guess.

06:47.973 --> 06:49.040
But a better route

06:49.108 --> 06:52.644
is to give a small something
to see where they're at.

06:52.711 --> 06:56.681
But by shutting the door,
they might walk away.

06:56.683 --> 07:00.185
- But we cannot say no.

07:00.252 --> 07:01.921
- Josh.

07:01.987 --> 07:03.455
I like your idea.

07:03.522 --> 07:04.789
- Okay.
- Don't counter.

07:04.857 --> 07:07.725
Let's wait and see how much
further they will come up with.

07:07.793 --> 07:09.060
- Okay.
- And all I can promise,

07:09.062 --> 07:11.596
I will communicate
with my employer...

07:11.664 --> 07:13.932
- Yeah.
- If they're willing to go

07:14.000 --> 07:16.935
any lower,
which is very debatable.

07:17.736 --> 07:19.737
Very, very debatable.

07:19.805 --> 07:22.707
- Okay.
- Thank you. And good luck.

07:22.709 --> 07:25.076
Please, do your best.
- Yeah, yeah.

07:25.078 --> 07:27.612
<i>Obviously, I went a little
rogue in that meeting.</i>

07:27.680 --> 07:30.949
I've negotiated
with tons of Russians before.

07:30.951 --> 07:32.350
I'm 50% Russian.

07:32.352 --> 07:35.954
<i>You can't bully a Russian.
But I know Yuri.</i>

07:35.956 --> 07:37.689
I've worked
with Yuri in the past.

07:37.757 --> 07:39.891
<i>If we approach this
in the correct way,</i>

07:39.893 --> 07:42.827
<i>we can appease the seller
by playing hardball first,</i>

07:42.829 --> 07:46.632
then maybe they'll be open
to giving us a decent counter.

07:46.699 --> 07:49.034
- Dude, we have to get a counter

07:49.101 --> 07:51.903
and us being different opinions
makes us look weak. Like--

07:51.971 --> 07:54.106
- I saw what direction
that was going in,

07:54.173 --> 07:56.040
and it was going bad fast.

07:56.108 --> 07:59.310
Not that I disagree with you.
I don't disagree with you.

07:59.378 --> 08:01.179
But right now, let it sink in.

08:01.247 --> 08:03.248
Let him sleep on it.
We'll come back to him.

08:03.315 --> 08:06.151
- I'll go with your strategy.
And I trust you

08:06.153 --> 08:07.952
as long as you go with
my strategy in the end

08:08.020 --> 08:09.053
and get a counter.

08:09.121 --> 08:12.023
- I will push for a counter.
No question about it.

08:12.025 --> 08:13.993
- I thought I was going crazy
in there like a twilight zone.

08:14.059 --> 08:16.327
- No, it's-- [laughs]

08:16.329 --> 08:17.629
<i>- Coming up.</i>

08:17.696 --> 08:19.264
<i>- Whoa!
- Oh, my goodness.</i>

08:19.331 --> 08:20.865
- Holy sh--.

08:20.933 --> 08:23.668
<i>I love that you've got
the Vitrocsa windows.</i>

08:23.670 --> 08:25.136
- Except they're not Vitrocsa.

08:25.204 --> 08:27.138
They're Schuco.
- I meant Schuco. Sorry.

08:27.206 --> 08:28.940
Can we open it?
I love the lighting.

08:29.008 --> 08:29.875
- Yeah, but you're pressing
the wrong button.

08:29.942 --> 08:31.142
- Oh, sh--.

- Something, yeah.

12:00.352 --> 12:01.886

Thank God for that.

12:01.888 --> 12:03.988

- Perfect.

12:04.690 --> 12:05.958
<i>Just gorgeous.</i>

12:12.164 --> 12:13.831

12:13.899 --> 12:16.434

12:16.436 --> 12:17.569

12:17.636 --> 12:19.170

Venetian plaster.

12:19.238 --> 12:20.671

- Come on, James.

12:20.739 --> 12:22.173
You gotta know these things.

12:22.175 --> 12:25.076
- Sometimes when you don't
know something for sure,

12:26.979 --> 12:28.113
better keep it zipped.

12:28.180 --> 12:30.181
- Check this out.
Here's the sky windows.

12:30.183 --> 12:31.783

- Wow.

12:31.785 --> 12:32.918
- That's so cool.
- Here's how they work.

12:32.985 --> 12:34.819

12:34.887 --> 12:36.220
<i>It's tinted, but it changes.</i>

12:36.222 --> 12:37.922

12:40.058 --> 12:41.827
Just amazing.
- Yeah, hit it.

12:41.894 --> 12:42.927

12:42.995 --> 12:43.928

12:43.930 --> 12:45.062

12:45.130 --> 12:46.265

Sorry.

12:46.331 --> 12:47.866

12:49.668 --> 12:50.768
I'm off my game.

12:50.836 --> 12:52.737

primary bedroom, guys.

12:52.739 --> 12:54.940
- Love.

12:55.007 --> 12:57.141
- We have six bedrooms,
eight bathrooms.

12:57.209 --> 12:59.210
And they're all large,
large bathrooms.

12:59.278 --> 13:01.846
- Can I guess what material
this is?

13:01.914 --> 13:02.981
- If you want.

13:03.048 --> 13:03.915
Guarantee you'll get it wrong.

13:03.917 --> 13:05.883
But sure.
- Is it oak?

13:05.951 --> 13:07.151
- You got it right.
- Oh, finally!

13:07.219 --> 13:09.220
I had to redeem myself somehow.

13:09.288 --> 13:10.821
----In' finally!

13:10.823 --> 13:14.492
One in ten,
it's a really bad innings.

13:14.494 --> 13:16.060
I think that's what
they call it in baseball.

13:17.963 --> 13:20.165
- This is the bathroom.
Obviously, you can see

13:20.232 --> 13:22.466
some of the detailing here
is pretty spectacular.

13:22.534 --> 13:25.036
- This is stunning.
- Absolutely stunning, guys.

13:27.039 --> 13:28.841
- The dialed in detail.

13:30.242 --> 13:32.310
This is all steel,
this entire staircase, right?

13:32.378 --> 13:34.579
- Yes.
- Did you have to crane it in?

13:34.646 --> 13:38.216
- Yeah, of course.
- Yeah, this is like no joke.

13:38.283 --> 13:41.252
- Look at this, you've done
a full wellness center.

13:41.320 --> 13:44.088
- Correct.
- Oh, my God.

13:44.156 --> 13:47.091
What the hell is this?
I've not seen one of these.

13:47.093 --> 13:49.027
- So this is a deprivation tank.

13:49.094 --> 13:50.896
There's saltwater
and you just float

13:50.962 --> 13:52.630
and basically supposed
to take you back

13:52.698 --> 13:54.131
to when you were in the womb.

13:54.199 --> 13:55.733
- Valeria would ----in'
lock me in there.

13:55.801 --> 13:57.902
- Yeah.

14:02.140 --> 14:04.008
- This is the chef
kitchen here...

14:04.010 --> 14:06.144
- How do you get in?
- And wine cellar.

14:06.146 --> 14:08.446
- I do love this detail
that runs this entire wall.

14:08.514 --> 14:10.415
Oh, wow.
- This is a concealed door.

14:10.482 --> 14:13.284
- Oh, my Lord.
- This is incredible.

14:13.352 --> 14:14.752
This is where you make the mess.

14:14.820 --> 14:15.953
This is where you cook the meal,

14:16.021 --> 14:19.558
and then you put it in the
dumbwaiter, take it upstairs.

14:19.625 --> 14:21.292
- The scale is incredible.

14:21.360 --> 14:23.794
There are a lot of incredible
houses in the Bird Streets.

14:23.862 --> 14:25.664
But this house, it's on its own.

14:25.731 --> 14:27.765
When you look at the materials
that have been used

14:27.833 --> 14:30.034
to build this house, the steel,

14:30.102 --> 14:32.136
the glass, the limestone,

14:32.138 --> 14:34.038
it's very, very organic.

14:34.106 --> 14:36.641
There's basically no drywall
in the whole house.

14:36.708 --> 14:38.042
- Four years in the making,

14:38.044 --> 14:40.044
the guy never moves in,
and here we are.

14:40.046 --> 14:41.312
- Tell me what you guys
are thinking.

14:41.380 --> 14:42.380
- This is one of the most
extraordinary houses

14:42.448 --> 14:45.249
I've ever seen.
I know, obviously, you as well.

14:45.317 --> 14:47.085
The buyer of a property
like this,

14:47.152 --> 14:48.819
they are buying a piece of art.
- Yeah.

14:48.887 --> 14:51.155
- It feels expensive.

14:51.157 --> 14:53.324
- You have any idea
in your head pricing wise?

14:53.326 --> 14:55.594
- Yeah.
- This is an interesting one.

14:55.661 --> 14:56.861
- You're selling a lifestyle.

14:56.928 --> 14:58.263
You're in the Bird Streets.

14:58.331 --> 15:00.665
You've got this unbelievable
piece of art.

15:00.732 --> 15:04.135
I'm thinking it's somewhere
between 2,500 to 2,800 a foot,

15:04.203 --> 15:05.336
based on comps.

15:05.404 --> 15:06.937
- Yeah, I wouldn't
want to hit 3,000.

15:06.939 --> 15:08.272
I think if we hit 3,000,

15:08.340 --> 15:09.340
we're gonna shoot ourselves
in the foot.

15:09.408 --> 15:11.275
- But I'm thinking
that maybe it's

15:11.343 --> 15:13.277
right there at 30 million.

15:13.345 --> 15:14.612
It's a palatable price point

15:14.680 --> 15:16.982
for what people expect
in the Bird Streets.

15:17.048 --> 15:19.084
Once you start pushing past 30,

15:19.151 --> 15:20.851
I fear that you start
losing buyers.

15:20.919 --> 15:22.154
I really do.

15:22.220 --> 15:24.722
- All right, fair point.

15:24.724 --> 15:26.658
- Thoughts?

15:26.725 --> 15:28.927
- Thinking.

15:30.362 --> 15:32.296
All right, let's do this, guys.

15:32.364 --> 15:34.365

- Venetian plaster.

15:34.433 --> 15:36.167

- Brilliant.

15:36.235 --> 15:37.102
- Make sure you get
the materials right.

15:37.169 --> 15:39.837

a list inventory

16:35.660 --> 16:38.429
Unfortunately, she didn't
see anything that she likes.

16:38.431 --> 16:40.965
<i>- I love that it's brand new.
The view is beyond.</i>

16:41.033 --> 16:42.833
<i>But it's really expensive.</i>

16:42.835 --> 16:45.570
<i>The yard is very small,
and I'm looking for grounds.</i>

16:45.637 --> 16:47.439
- Got it.
- But this house is beautiful.

16:47.506 --> 16:50.041
<i>- Now Carly really has
her heart set on finding</i>

16:50.108 --> 16:52.043
a perfect lot in
The Flats of Beverly Hills

16:52.045 --> 16:53.444
that she can build a house on.

16:53.512 --> 16:54.912
<i>So we did some
old-fashioned door knocking.</i>

16:54.914 --> 16:56.314
- Oh, my God.

16:56.316 --> 16:57.716
- You look at this one
and tell me what you think.

16:57.783 --> 16:59.217
- We're gonna get arrested.

16:59.284 --> 17:00.518
Okay.
- What do you think?

17:00.586 --> 17:02.887
- It looks like it's
got a nice back garden.

17:02.955 --> 17:03.988
[doorbell rings]

17:04.056 --> 17:05.923
[dogs barking]
- Hi.

17:05.925 --> 17:09.861
I was wondering if you guys
are considering selling?

17:09.928 --> 17:12.197
- Uh, no.
My parents own the house.

17:13.031 --> 17:14.966
- Oh, hi!

17:17.870 --> 17:19.237
- Oh, yes.

17:19.304 --> 17:20.338
- Would you ever
consider selling?

17:23.608 --> 17:25.043
- Oh, my gosh.

17:25.744 --> 17:28.212
<i>- I'm really excited to show
her this lot on Crescent.</i>

17:28.214 --> 17:30.214
And guess what, we're not
trespassing this time.

17:30.282 --> 17:33.417
<i>- This lot feels massive.
- Because it is massive.</i>

17:33.419 --> 17:35.686
- It was Doris Day's house.
- Oh, no way.

17:35.688 --> 17:37.421
<i>- Yeah.
- I love Doris Day.</i>

17:37.423 --> 17:38.222
<i>- Who doesn't like Doris Day?</i>

17:38.290 --> 17:39.624
- It's got that
Doris Day energy.

17:39.691 --> 17:41.059
- Yeah.

17:41.127 --> 17:43.061
So my friend Alexa

17:43.063 --> 17:45.029
who works for me
and myself just listed this.

17:45.031 --> 17:46.230
This belongs to her dad.

17:46.298 --> 17:48.032
They want to sell the property.

17:48.100 --> 17:50.568
And you're the first person in.

17:50.636 --> 17:53.505
And this is a really good lot.
This is exactly what you want.

17:53.572 --> 17:55.573
- Just to get a sense,
can we just see around?

17:55.575 --> 17:57.708
Plus, I'm like nosy and I want
to see Doris Day's house.

17:57.776 --> 17:59.678
- Okay. Come. Let me show you.
- Perfect.

18:01.881 --> 18:04.716
- How many bedrooms is this?
- It is five bedrooms.

18:07.653 --> 18:09.687
It's like a maze.
- It is like a maze.

18:09.689 --> 18:11.722
It's like bigger than you think.

18:14.459 --> 18:16.494
<i>- Then you have
your primary suite.</i>

18:16.561 --> 18:18.829
- I think you know
this is not my style.

18:18.897 --> 18:21.299
- Right.
- I definitely need to demo it.

18:21.366 --> 18:22.800
So I need to see
what we're working with.

18:22.802 --> 18:24.769
- Sorry, Doris Day,
we're blowing the place up.

18:24.836 --> 18:27.105
- Doris, we love you.
- We love you.

18:28.741 --> 18:31.075
- What is the square footage
on this house?

18:31.143 --> 18:32.743
- This is like
4,200 square feet.

18:32.745 --> 18:34.779
<i>It's not a terribly
large house at all.</i>

18:34.781 --> 18:36.615
- Okay.
- Now, (BLEEP) the house.

18:36.681 --> 18:38.149
Let's go to what's
most important.

18:38.151 --> 18:39.617
It's all about the land.

18:41.486 --> 18:42.888
- [gasps]

18:42.954 --> 18:45.489
<i>Oh...
- It's your own private park.</i>

18:45.557 --> 18:48.759
- My God!

18:48.761 --> 18:51.495
<i>- This lot is
30,000 square feet.</i>

18:51.563 --> 18:53.898
- I love that it's really wide
and really deep,

18:53.965 --> 18:55.766
<i>and it's got the high hedges.</i>

18:55.768 --> 18:58.602
Wow.
- And it can all be yours.

18:58.670 --> 19:01.105
- Oh, no, All right, go on.

19:01.107 --> 19:03.175
How much?
- Just under 13 million.

19:04.509 --> 19:06.744
- That's like a lot more
than the budget.

19:06.811 --> 19:09.980
- Eh, you'll find it
under the mattress.

19:10.048 --> 19:11.582
- Under the mattress?

19:11.650 --> 19:13.351
<i>- The truth is that building
the modern style house</i>

19:13.418 --> 19:16.453
<i>that she wants could be easily
another $5 or $6 million.</i>

19:16.521 --> 19:19.056
But this house is
definitely worth 13 million.

19:19.124 --> 19:20.725
<i>Based on land value alone,</i>

19:20.727 --> 19:24.129
<i>everything surrounding it
is about $300 to $700 a foot.</i>

19:24.196 --> 19:26.597
Guess what?
None of them are for sale.

19:26.665 --> 19:27.799
This is it, baby.

19:27.866 --> 19:30.268
<i>I told you,
there's only 40, 45 lots</i>

19:30.335 --> 19:31.470
in The Flats of Beverly Hills

19:31.536 --> 19:33.203
that have this
kind of square footage.

19:33.205 --> 19:34.940
And you're standing
on one of them.

19:35.006 --> 19:37.609
<i>There's no other 30,000 square
foot lots on the market.</i>

19:37.676 --> 19:39.711
And frankly,
I don't see any coming up.

19:40.779 --> 19:42.680
- So this was Doris Day's house?

19:42.748 --> 19:43.881
- This was Doris Day's house.

19:43.949 --> 19:45.616
- Is it on some sort of list?
- No.

19:45.684 --> 19:47.551
- Like if I come in
with a wrecking ball--

19:47.553 --> 19:49.187
- This is not
on the historical list.

19:49.255 --> 19:51.689
And you can do
whatever you want here.

19:51.756 --> 19:53.457
<i>There's no reason
in saving a property</i>

19:53.459 --> 19:54.959
<i>just because it's old.</i>

19:55.026 --> 19:56.293
You save it because it's old

19:56.361 --> 19:58.095
and architecturally significant.

19:58.097 --> 19:59.530
<i>Crescent has strange lines,</i>

19:59.598 --> 20:01.132
<i>it doesn't have
a functional floor plan.</i>

20:01.134 --> 20:04.168
<i>It's not architecturally
pretty by any means.</i>

20:04.236 --> 20:06.704
Believe me, if there was
anything worth saving about it,

20:06.772 --> 20:08.505
I would tell you.
I would be the first.

20:08.573 --> 20:11.575
- But 13 just for a lot,
like, that's ridiculous

20:11.577 --> 20:12.711
'cause then you have
to build a house--

20:12.777 --> 20:13.844
- Come back to me
in five years from now

20:13.912 --> 20:16.580
and tell me if you still
share that same philosophy.

20:16.648 --> 20:18.716
It's just gonna keep
going up in value.

20:18.784 --> 20:21.485
- Do you think you can get,
like, a good deal on it?

20:21.487 --> 20:22.988
- I don't think so.

20:23.054 --> 20:25.489
- What? Just no?

20:25.491 --> 20:27.357
That's a very
defeatist attitude.

20:27.426 --> 20:28.626
- Well, I'm just
being honest with you.

20:28.693 --> 20:29.793
I'm being straight to the point.

20:29.861 --> 20:31.929
If you want this property...
- Yeah.

20:31.997 --> 20:32.930
- Let's write an offer.

20:32.998 --> 20:35.000
But I'm just telling you,
there's no room on this.

20:35.066 --> 20:36.334
<i>In the real estate game,</i>

20:36.401 --> 20:38.335
it can be a very big
conflict of interest

20:38.403 --> 20:40.137
if you represent
both sides of a deal.

20:40.205 --> 20:43.741
<i>If you know what you're doing
and if you are really good</i>

20:43.808 --> 20:46.410
at being neutral and aiming
to put a deal together

20:46.478 --> 20:49.548
which benefits both parties,
I think it's acceptable.

20:49.614 --> 20:52.083
The guy I know who owns it
is not super motivated.

20:52.150 --> 20:54.285
He wants his price and so
I can tell you that upfront,

20:54.352 --> 20:57.722
which means there's really not
gonna be a negotiation here.

21:52.278 --> 21:54.278
And you pushed back,
I hope, I assume.

21:54.346 --> 21:55.579
- I pushed back.
I pushed back enough.

21:55.581 --> 21:56.680
But at the same time, I said,

21:56.748 --> 21:59.016
"Okay, look, if this deal's--"
- You didn't push back.

21:59.084 --> 22:00.484
- I knew they weren't
gonna counter.

22:00.552 --> 22:01.885
- It's just so frustrating
'cause I like Yuri,

22:01.953 --> 22:03.321
I like him a lot...
- Yeah.

22:03.389 --> 22:07.224
- But I think
if we had direct access

22:07.292 --> 22:08.492
to the actual seller,

22:08.560 --> 22:10.295
maybe things would be
like easier, like,

22:10.362 --> 22:12.296
maybe some things
are lost in translation.

22:12.364 --> 22:14.833
- There's 100%
lost in translation.

22:14.899 --> 22:17.701
And that's the frustrating part
about dealing with a seller

22:17.703 --> 22:20.504
that you don't--can't deal
with directly.

22:21.039 --> 22:23.173
- And then you said goodbye.
- Yeah, yeah.

22:23.241 --> 22:25.543
I mean, I just--I said,
"We'll do our best."

22:25.610 --> 22:27.978
And then we, you know,
spoke about,

22:28.046 --> 22:29.847
you know, some other stuff.
And then it was like, whatever.

22:29.849 --> 22:31.983
- Spoke about other things?

22:31.985 --> 22:35.252
- He felt that you didn't
have the same enthusiasm

22:35.320 --> 22:38.123
that I had towards the property.

22:38.189 --> 22:40.524
And he was like--

22:40.592 --> 22:44.395
He asked me if I should
just do this by myself...

22:44.462 --> 22:45.863
- What?

22:45.865 --> 22:48.966
- And--and let you go
off of the listing.

23:00.812 --> 23:03.747
- He wanted to fire me?
- Yeah.

23:03.749 --> 23:06.083
- So like my 50%
will be dissolved

23:06.085 --> 23:07.551
and you would get 100%.

23:07.619 --> 23:09.821

<i>I can't believe

23:11.156 --> 23:14.359
I mean, co-listing with Altman,
I gave it a lot of thought

23:14.426 --> 23:16.094
because I was scared that

23:16.161 --> 23:18.630
things could go back
to a bad place.

23:18.696 --> 23:21.298
<i>But this is not what I expected.</i>

23:21.366 --> 23:22.699
Ugh!

- Listen, you don't have
to worry about anything.

23:24.569 --> 23:26.036
I said that we work
well together.

23:26.038 --> 23:27.705
I said you're great
at what you do.

23:27.772 --> 23:29.407
He does bring a lot
to the table.

23:29.475 --> 23:31.108
I think that
he has a great reach.

23:31.176 --> 23:33.543

23:33.612 --> 23:34.578
I need him.

23:34.646 --> 23:35.913
I want him on the deal.

23:35.915 --> 23:37.849
I wouldn't do it without him.

23:37.916 --> 23:39.850
And I said, "I'd rather
not have the listing."

23:39.918 --> 23:41.685
I said it's the two of us--
- You did not say that.

23:41.687 --> 23:43.555
- Swear. I said,
"It's the two of us

23:43.621 --> 23:45.423
and that's it."
- You said that?

23:45.491 --> 23:46.457
- We signed onto

or we're not together.

24:05.143 --> 24:06.277
I'm with you no matter
what the outcome is.

24:06.344 --> 24:07.746
- Okay.

Have you ever seen

We're gonna hold hands

24:11.382 --> 24:13.651
and drive off a cliff together
if we lose the listening.

24:13.718 --> 24:16.387
- Drive off Beverly Park like--

24:16.389 --> 24:17.756
- I'm definitely Louise.

24:17.822 --> 24:22.026
Listen, everything about me
is Susan Sarandon, okay?

24:22.093 --> 24:23.361
- I'm not Thelma.

24:23.428 --> 24:24.495
<i>I have to be redhead.</i>

24:42.514 --> 24:44.983
So it almost feels like the
terrace is part of the room.

24:45.049 --> 24:47.184
- Yeah, the view
is lovely from here,

<i>- That's what my clients

28:09.654 --> 28:11.521
They're also looking for
some primary homes as well.

28:11.523 --> 28:13.123

28:13.125 --> 28:15.825
<i>- South Korea.

28:15.894 --> 28:18.328
This is the type of house
that will sell to someone

three, four, five houses.

28:21.065 --> 28:23.533

28:25.671 --> 28:28.839

28:28.906 --> 28:31.008
When you think
of the Bird Streets,

28:34.278 --> 28:36.213

We've seen comps

There was a sale one street away

28:43.087 --> 28:45.288
for 78 million
just three months ago.

28:45.356 --> 28:47.157
And so we feel like we're priced

28:47.225 --> 28:49.860
very well here at 29.995.
- Yeah.

28:51.329 --> 28:54.364
<i>- This entire wall
was designed for artwork.</i>

28:54.366 --> 28:56.900
The finish on this wall
is Venetian plaster.

28:56.968 --> 28:59.036
- Wow.
- Dining area.

28:59.104 --> 29:01.671
And then you have two kitchens.
- Oh, fabulous.

29:01.739 --> 29:03.707
- This is strictly
the show kitchen.

29:03.709 --> 29:06.044
Yes, it's fully functional.

29:06.110 --> 29:09.379
But there is
a dumbwaiter right here.

29:09.381 --> 29:11.916
- Mmm.
- You can put all of your stuff

29:11.983 --> 29:14.117
into here and it goes down
to the chef's kitchen.

29:14.119 --> 29:15.953
So literally, all the mess
can be made downstairs

29:16.020 --> 29:17.721
and it's huge.
- Out of sight, out of mind.

29:17.723 --> 29:19.089
- Exactly, exactly.

29:19.091 --> 29:20.924
- Let's go check out
the primary bedroom,

29:20.992 --> 29:22.193
which is fabulous.

29:24.128 --> 29:26.396
Beautiful oak paneled walls,

29:26.398 --> 29:29.666
and you get the big ocean view
from your bed as well.

29:29.668 --> 29:30.735
- Spectacular view.

29:30.802 --> 29:32.502
- Your client,
is it a family or--

29:32.570 --> 29:34.705
- So they are a family.
- Children or--how many?

29:34.707 --> 29:36.673
- Yes, two children, 12 and 7.

29:36.675 --> 29:39.276
- For a 12- and 7-year-old,
the floorplan here is perfect

29:39.344 --> 29:41.112
'cause you have one bedroom
right next to you,

29:41.179 --> 29:42.813
which would be great
for a 7-year-old.

29:42.880 --> 29:45.850
And then you have 4 suites down
that I think, if I were 12,

29:45.916 --> 29:48.685
I'd want to be away from Mom
and Dad and have the privacy.

29:48.753 --> 29:50.153
- Yeah, don't get me wrong.

29:50.221 --> 29:52.622
The view is lovely from here,
but, it's a little

29:52.690 --> 29:55.258
on the smaller side
for a home like this.

29:55.326 --> 29:57.327
I'm a little concerned
about the privacy

29:57.329 --> 29:59.162
with that neighbor
right next door

29:59.230 --> 30:01.264
because my clients
are very private.

30:01.332 --> 30:02.933
It seems a little too close.

30:03.001 --> 30:05.802
- But with these big glass
opening doors,

30:05.870 --> 30:08.305
you get that transition
from the inside to the outside.

30:08.372 --> 30:10.807
So it almost feels like the
terrace is part of the room.

30:10.809 --> 30:13.377
- Yeah, you got a good point.
- You could do big planters.

30:13.379 --> 30:15.713
That would screen
off the neighbor's deck.

30:15.780 --> 30:18.381
And then on this street,
you've got only three houses.

30:18.449 --> 30:19.783
And so I think if you went about

30:19.850 --> 30:21.318
three feet higher
on these planters,

30:21.386 --> 30:22.986
you'd get rid of those houses

30:22.988 --> 30:25.255
but you'd still get
an ocean view.

30:25.323 --> 30:27.257
So there's ways
to work around it for sure.

30:27.325 --> 30:28.392
- Okay.

30:31.462 --> 30:34.531
- Downstairs is dedicated
to pure wellness.

30:34.599 --> 30:37.401
So you have a full gym,
spa setup.

we can do a deal together.

30:50.448 --> 30:53.050
- I'm gonna push this
magic button and the door

30:53.052 --> 30:54.684

30:54.752 --> 30:56.219

33:53.999 --> 33:55.533
What are you doing tonight?

33:55.599 --> 33:57.601
- I'm having a party
at the house for dinner.

33:57.603 --> 34:00.169
I'm gonna have them make
one more place setting for you.

34:00.238 --> 34:03.007
And you can be with me
as I hear the news.

34:08.279 --> 34:10.313
Any word?
- Nothing yet, honey.

34:10.315 --> 34:12.882
- Why is it taking so long?

34:12.950 --> 34:14.051
- She's buying a house.

34:14.118 --> 34:17.020
- The owner's being, like,
a curmudgeon.

34:17.088 --> 34:18.621
- No, he's not.
He wants his price.

34:18.689 --> 34:19.957
- I would have called him
in a second

34:20.024 --> 34:21.959
and say, "Clean up your act."

34:22.026 --> 34:25.596
- Thank you so much.
You might still need to.

34:25.663 --> 34:27.565
- Isn't he the nicest animal
you've ever seen in your life?

34:27.631 --> 34:30.066
- I love this dog!

34:30.134 --> 34:31.768
- You do your own makeup
or you got it done?

34:31.770 --> 34:32.702
- No, I do it myself.

34:32.704 --> 34:37.107
- You did that yourself?
Good job. I can't.

34:37.109 --> 34:39.009
- So let's sit down for dinner.

34:39.077 --> 34:40.511
- Okay!
- It's pretty. isn't it?

34:40.578 --> 34:43.047
- Table's beautiful.
- I'm over here, okay.

34:43.114 --> 34:44.248
- This is intimate.

34:44.315 --> 34:46.049
- Oh, these are my same glasses.

34:46.051 --> 34:47.917
- Perfect.

34:47.985 --> 34:49.819
- Beautiful, thank you, Gloria.

34:49.887 --> 34:52.123
[glass clinking]

34:52.189 --> 34:55.525
I just wanted to say, everyone,
thank you for coming tonight.

34:55.593 --> 34:58.061
I wanted to put the strangest,
most eclectic crowd together.

34:58.063 --> 34:59.729
And I think I was successful.
- Yes.

34:59.797 --> 35:01.297
- We were gonna do
a Shabbat tonight.

35:01.365 --> 35:02.866
But there's only five Jews
at the table.

35:02.933 --> 35:04.467
So we decided not to.

35:04.469 --> 35:07.370
- Excuse me, I'm honorary.
- You're an honorary Jew.

35:07.372 --> 35:10.007
- This is the first dinner
party for so many of us.

35:10.074 --> 35:11.741
- This is the first time
you've been out?

35:11.809 --> 35:14.278
- In several months, yeah.
- Really?

35:14.345 --> 35:15.879
- I mean, in a dinner party.
- Yeah, same.

35:15.946 --> 35:17.280
- Really?

35:17.348 --> 35:19.015
- So what's going on with work?
How's it going?

35:19.017 --> 35:21.485
- Work is good. I'm working on
an offer with Carly right now.

35:21.552 --> 35:22.686
- And how's it going?
- She doesn't realize

35:22.753 --> 35:24.188
this is like
a one-of-a-kind property.

35:24.254 --> 35:25.822
It's Doris Day's old property.
- Oh, my God.

35:25.890 --> 35:27.857
- Right now, we're negotiating
on a property.

35:27.859 --> 35:29.894
And now we're waiting to see
if he's accepted.

35:29.960 --> 35:32.896
But Josh isn't feeling,
like, very confident.

35:32.963 --> 35:34.298
I'm super anxious.

35:34.365 --> 35:36.366
It's literally
all I can think about.

35:41.506 --> 35:43.573
- Wow.
- Ooh, wonderful.

35:43.575 --> 35:44.841
- All right.
- Fabulous.

35:44.909 --> 35:45.809
- Bon appétit.

35:45.877 --> 35:48.778
[phone ringing]
- Josh, your phone is ringing.

35:48.780 --> 35:50.347
- Hello.

35:50.414 --> 35:51.515
- Let me--hold on.
Let me--I'm at dinner.

35:51.582 --> 35:52.782
Let me just step away
for a second.

35:52.850 --> 35:54.651
Hold on one second, okay?

35:54.718 --> 35:58.222
- Josh, this is--this is not
how I imagined this would be.

35:58.288 --> 36:00.390
[laughter]

36:00.392 --> 36:02.158
<i>- In real estate, you never know</i>

36:02.160 --> 36:03.426
when the deal is gonna close.

36:03.428 --> 36:05.195
So you pick up the phone
whenever and wherever.

36:05.262 --> 36:06.596
I take calls at all hours
of the night.

36:06.664 --> 36:08.165
I take calls
all hours of the day.

36:08.233 --> 36:11.067
I'm pretty easy to reach.

36:11.135 --> 36:12.936
Just not at 7:00
in the morning.

36:13.003 --> 36:15.605
- Bobby, can you be the broker?

36:15.673 --> 36:17.407
We need to switch brokers now.

36:17.475 --> 36:19.209
- Yes.
- Done, done.

36:19.276 --> 36:21.011
- You're on, you're on.
Just Bobby.

36:21.078 --> 36:23.880
- That might cause a divorce.
- That's okay. We can roleplay.

36:23.948 --> 36:25.815
- You do remember,
on our listing appointment,

36:25.817 --> 36:28.885
I told you that we were asking
a really high price for this.

36:28.953 --> 36:31.588
I told you that 13
was way too aggressive.

36:44.768 --> 36:46.970
- The seller has
all the cards in his hand.

36:47.037 --> 36:48.905
You know, he doesn't need
to sell this property.

36:48.973 --> 36:50.374
<i>And I know Carly's
feeling nervous</i>

36:50.441 --> 36:52.275
'cause I think she realizes that

36:52.277 --> 36:54.411
this is a diamond in the rough.

36:54.413 --> 36:56.179
Okay.
- What happened?

36:56.247 --> 36:57.781
- Can I speak
with you separately?

36:57.783 --> 36:59.883
- Yes.
- We'll be right back.

36:59.950 --> 37:02.219
- Do I need a drink for this?
- Yeah.

37:02.221 --> 37:04.053
- Yes.

37:04.055 --> 37:05.788
- Listen, if you
want this house...

37:05.856 --> 37:06.990
- Yeah.

37:06.992 --> 37:08.392
- He's at 12 million.

37:08.459 --> 37:10.460
- It's still, like,
almost a million more

37:10.462 --> 37:12.128
than he paid for it.
- You know what?

37:12.196 --> 37:14.197
It's worth like 11.6 to 11.8.

37:14.264 --> 37:15.999
That's the reality.
But here's the thing.

37:16.066 --> 37:17.800
That's the property that you've
been asking me for a while.

37:17.868 --> 37:19.869
You said you wanted
a big piece of land,

37:19.937 --> 37:20.870
you wanted high hedges,

37:20.872 --> 37:22.406
you wanted a 30,000
plus square foot lot.

37:22.473 --> 37:24.441
This is something
that you can't replace.

37:24.508 --> 37:26.243
You want this, right?
- Yeah.

37:26.311 --> 37:28.144
- Sometimes you got
to overpay a little bit.

37:28.212 --> 37:30.447
- All right, the highest
we can go is 11.5. That's it.

37:30.514 --> 37:31.948
- 11.5?
- For me, it's the build.

37:31.950 --> 37:33.016
- It's not gonna happen.

37:33.018 --> 37:35.618
I'm gonna go back at 11.5.
I'm just telling you.

37:35.686 --> 37:37.620
<i>I did try to steer Carly
away from building</i>

37:37.688 --> 37:40.257
a new structure because
building in Beverly Hills

37:40.325 --> 37:41.691
can cost a lot of money

37:41.759 --> 37:44.695
and can also be very
time consuming for people.

37:44.762 --> 37:47.163
<i>She might go over her budget,
but I actually think</i>

37:47.231 --> 37:48.265
it's gonna be a good investment.

37:48.333 --> 37:50.867
Okay, so we're at 11.5.

37:52.170 --> 37:54.403
- Can you put it on speaker?

37:54.472 --> 37:55.872
- So what do you want
to go back at?

38:00.778 --> 38:03.646
- Can you hold on one second?
Hold on one second.

38:03.714 --> 38:05.515
- At the end of the day,
this property is gonna be worth

38:05.583 --> 38:07.884
three times the amount
in ten years from now.

38:09.387 --> 38:13.457
- Well... all right,
let me text. One sec.

38:23.300 --> 38:25.201
Okay, let's close it at 11.8.

38:25.269 --> 38:27.938
- Okay, you got a deal at 11.8.

38:28.005 --> 38:28.938
- You're welcome, sir.

38:28.940 --> 38:31.074
So we'll open our escrow
in the morning.

38:31.141 --> 38:33.343
<i>I understand that Carly might
be disappointed in the moment.</i>

38:33.410 --> 38:34.745
<i>But guess what?</i>

38:34.812 --> 38:37.213
There's not that many
30,000 plus square foot lots

38:37.281 --> 38:39.283
in The Flats and
you have to pay a premium

38:39.350 --> 38:41.417
if you want something
that's special.

38:41.485 --> 38:43.853
- Thank you so much.
You are the best.

38:43.921 --> 38:45.822
<i>- Would I say this is
a successful evening?</i>

38:45.889 --> 38:47.023
<i>I would say so.</i>

38:47.025 --> 38:48.524
<i>I have a bunch of people

eat anything off my plate.

non-negotiable 28.5, period.

- Excuse me?
- If it's not 28.5,

39:17.789 --> 39:19.455
they would like to postpone

39:19.523 --> 39:20.857

39:38.876 --> 39:40.944
- I'll admit.
Your strategy worked.

39:41.011 --> 39:43.213
- That was a 50-50 shot
by the way.

39:43.280 --> 39:45.615
I mean, I'd like to take credit
for it, but I'm just saying...

39:45.683 --> 39:47.818
- You like to gamble, my man.
- It was a gamble.

39:48.218 --> 39:50.954
<i>- The neighbor that put in
the offer at 22 million</i>

39:51.021 --> 39:54.023
was really taken aback
when we didn't counter.

39:54.025 --> 39:56.960
<i>And we were silent.
But they thought about it</i>

39:57.027 --> 39:59.695
and they ended up negotiating
against themselves.

39:59.763 --> 40:03.833
They came up to 24.5 million
with a 2-week close.

40:03.901 --> 40:06.704

- Forget about that call, man.

We're a team. No "I" in team.

<i>he was just trying to
fire me off the listing.</i>

40:48.145 --> 40:50.347
We have good news.
- Great news.

40:51.749 --> 40:53.416
of not countering
for a little while

40:53.484 --> 40:54.618
worked in our favor...
- It worked.

came up to 24.5,

- Two-week escrow.

41:01.625 --> 41:04.194
- I mean, it's a layup. 24.5.

41:04.261 --> 41:06.096
- Yet.

41:06.163 --> 41:08.632
I spoke with the family
yesterday, and they--

41:08.699 --> 41:10.466
Absolutely non-negotiable.

41:10.468 --> 41:13.369
28.5, period.
- Excuse me?

41:13.437 --> 41:15.438
- 28.5, non-negotiable.

41:15.506 --> 41:17.440
They understand
it's a little higher

41:17.508 --> 41:19.375
than probably the market price.

41:19.377 --> 41:21.845
But still, if it's not 28.5,

41:21.912 --> 41:23.847
they would like to postpone

41:23.914 --> 41:25.182
and take it off the market.

41:25.249 --> 41:27.116
- Oh, you got to be kidding me.
- Yeah.

41:27.118 --> 41:30.053
- No, no, no.
- Wait for maybe a year.

41:30.055 --> 41:32.055
- The conversation
where they decided

41:32.057 --> 41:33.389
that they're, you know,
keeping it,

41:33.391 --> 41:34.724
taking it off the market,
whatever,

41:34.791 --> 41:36.059

41:36.061 --> 41:37.059
We're coming to you
with new information.

41:37.127 --> 41:40.629
Don't you even want to
run it by them at 24.5?

41:40.698 --> 41:43.734
- I have known this family
for almost 11 years.

41:43.800 --> 41:46.069
And if they say no means no.

41:49.540 --> 41:51.208
- Why don't we just
take a step back?

41:51.275 --> 41:52.942
We'll wait.
We'll put the buyer on ice.

41:53.010 --> 41:54.578
- They're not selling
out of desperation.

41:54.644 --> 41:57.614
They're selling
because they're selling.

41:57.681 --> 41:59.482
And that's what
they want to get,

41:59.550 --> 42:02.085
that's what they expect to get.

42:04.488 --> 42:08.091
- I understand that the owners
are maybe a little disconnected

42:08.093 --> 42:09.992
'cause they're overseas,
they're in Russia.

42:10.060 --> 42:11.762
<i>But come on, you got to respond.</i>

42:11.828 --> 42:13.963
And especially
an offer like this,

42:14.031 --> 42:15.565
you can't just take it
off the market.

42:15.632 --> 42:16.966
Are you kidding me?

42:17.034 --> 42:18.968
You're telling me
that that's it?

42:19.036 --> 42:20.303
- He's taking it off the market?

42:20.370 --> 42:21.905
- That's it.

42:24.107 --> 42:26.075
- So no really means no?
- It means no.

42:28.179 --> 42:31.114
- Well, you win some,
you lose some.

42:31.181 --> 42:32.182
<i>Unbelievable!</i>

42:32.249 --> 42:35.251
I thought today was the day
where Fredrik Eklund

42:35.319 --> 42:39.188
was finally gonna
sell something in Beverly Park.

42:39.190 --> 42:40.923
- All right, Yuri,
appreciate your time.

42:40.925 --> 42:44.728
- And it didn't happen.
I don't have any words.

42:45.662 --> 42:49.865
Oi, oi, oi.
- What a giant waste of time.

42:49.933 --> 42:53.669
- Listen, the one thing
that I feel good about

42:53.737 --> 42:56.038
is that we did our job.
The 24.5, in the end,

42:56.040 --> 42:57.875
is actually a really good
number.

42:57.941 --> 43:00.077
We did what we were
supposed to do.

43:00.143 --> 43:01.945
- This is so frustrating.
It's a waste.

43:02.012 --> 43:04.047
Like--like all the times
we've come up here,

43:04.114 --> 43:06.416
the money we spent marketing.
It's a waste.

43:06.483 --> 43:10.053
That was three months
nonstop work, phone calls,

43:10.120 --> 43:11.554
and we get nothing.

43:11.622 --> 43:13.923
I literally burnt 25 grand

43:13.991 --> 43:15.891
and Fredrik
literally burnt 25 grand.

43:15.959 --> 43:18.294
<i>Remember that next time
you want to be a realtor.</i>

43:18.296 --> 43:20.497
[whistles]
----ing gone.

43:20.564 --> 43:22.098
- I'll buy you dinner.
- All right.

43:22.165 --> 43:25.434
- Let's get out of here.
- Son of a--ugh!

43:25.502 --> 43:27.304
<i>- There's always a next one.</i>

43:27.972 --> 43:30.539
<i>- Next time on "Million Dollar
Listing: Los Angeles."</i>

43:30.607 --> 43:33.042
<i>- Holy! Whoa!</i>

43:33.110 --> 43:37.113
Oh, my God. Look at this.
- Isn't it great?

43:37.115 --> 43:39.382
<i>- I'll never take this
for granted.</i>

43:39.450 --> 43:42.251
- Oh my! Hello, Suzanne Somers
and Alan Hamel.

43:42.319 --> 43:45.588
- There's a bit of a situation,
and it's good news for us.

43:45.656 --> 43:47.224
- For us.
- Okay.

43:51.061 --> 43:52.829
<i>- Oh, my God! Look at this.</i>

43:52.831 --> 43:55.197
I feel like I'm on
a cruise ship right now.

43:55.265 --> 43:57.600
Every room in the house
has a view of the ocean.

43:57.668 --> 43:59.268
Oh, my God.

43:59.270 --> 44:00.870
<i>You're on the toilet,
you're watching the ocean.</i>

44:00.937 --> 44:02.771
That's better toilet real estate

44:02.840 --> 44:05.042
<i>than any other real estate
you can see.</i>

44:05.108 --> 44:08.077
You're either the number one
or you're not number one.

44:08.145 --> 44:10.079
- Or you're not anything.
Maybe you're iconic.

44:10.081 --> 44:11.614
- I got my award
'cause I earned it.

44:11.682 --> 44:14.150
- But we are
the top producing team

44:14.218 --> 44:15.886
in the nation, in the company.
We make a lot more--

44:15.952 --> 44:17.953
- I don't know you are
'cause you're not on that list.

44:18.021 --> 44:20.256
I mean, I'm just saying
Fredrik, it's bullsh--.
