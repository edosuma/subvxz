12:04.257 --> 12:07.892
AAH!

12:07.928 --> 12:10.261
DON'T WORRY.
IT'S DEAD.

12:10.297 --> 12:12.764
I TOLD YOU
NOT TO DO THAT.

12:12.799 --> 12:15.266
SHE TOLD ME
TO DO IT.

12:15.302 --> 12:16.267
ENOUGH!

12:16.303 --> 12:18.336
ENOUGH. JUST
TAKE IT AWAY.

12:18.371 --> 12:19.571
DAD, YOU'RE RED.

12:19.606 --> 12:21.106

12:21.141 --> 12:25.343
I WANTED TO GET
A LITTLE COLOR.

12:25.378 --> 12:27.846
THAT'S A GOOD BASE.

12:27.881 --> 12:29.748
THAT'S A GOOD BASE.

12:29.783 --> 12:32.016
YOU GOT TO DO THIS
IN STAGES.

12:32.052 --> 12:34.786
I'LL PUT THIS ON.
OW!

12:34.821 --> 12:36.354
DOES IT LOOK BAD?

12:36.389 --> 12:38.957
YOUR NOSE WOULD SHOW

12:38.992 --> 12:43.795
I'M O.K. IF I DON'T
MAKE MANY TURNS.

12:43.830 --> 12:45.797
WHERE ARE WE GOING?

12:45.832 --> 12:47.799
A PLACE CALLED
THE YACHTHOUSE.

12:47.834 --> 12:49.367
IT HAS FRESH SEAFOOD.

12:49.402 --> 12:51.269
LET'S TALK LOBSTER.

12:51.304 --> 12:53.738
YEAH! LOBSTER!

12:59.813 --> 13:01.846

13:16.329 --> 13:17.796
I'M DOWN THE LINE.

13:17.831 --> 13:19.664

13:36.349 --> 13:40.351
I GOT MINTS

13:41.788 --> 13:43.555

13:48.028 --> 13:50.361
CAPTAIN AL PELLET.

13:50.397 --> 13:52.831
HE'S WON
SEVEN YEARS STRAIGHT.

13:52.866 --> 13:54.365
I GUESS HE'S GOOD.

13:57.070 --> 13:59.237
WOW! THEY'RE BIG!

13:59.272 --> 14:00.205
EXCUSE ME, SIR.

14:21.761 --> 14:23.361
JUST FINE.

14:23.396 --> 14:25.230
THERE WILL BE

14:25.265 --> 14:28.032
WOULD YOU, UH,
PART THE WAVES

14:28.068 --> 14:30.335

14:37.944 --> 14:39.777
IT'S O.K.
IT'S O.K.

14:39.813 --> 14:42.780
I THOUGHT WE WERE
THE NEXT TABLE
OF FIVE.

14:42.816 --> 14:46.284
YOUR TABLE SHOULD
BE READY SHORTLY.

14:46.319 --> 14:47.752
WHAT ABOUT
THAT GROUP?

14:47.787 --> 14:51.389
MR. PELLET HAD
A RESERVATION.

14:51.424 --> 14:53.258
YOU DON'T TAKE
RESERVATIONS.

14:53.293 --> 14:55.894
WE DON'T,
EXCEPT FOR MR. PELLET.

14:55.929 --> 15:00.231
WE'LL HAVE

15:16.850 --> 15:18.816
NOBODY TELLS ME
I CAN'T SIT.

15:18.852 --> 15:20.084
I'LL SIT

15:20.120 --> 15:22.921
WE'RE NEXT.

15:22.956 --> 15:24.289
NO NEED FOR THOSE.

15:24.324 --> 15:27.258

TAKING THEM FOR A WALK.

15:53.153 --> 15:55.153
LOOK AT
THESE BEAUTIES.

15:55.188 --> 15:56.788
HEY!
DON'T SERVE THOSE.

15:56.823 --> 15:58.289
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

15:58.325 --> 16:00.124
THESE ARE

16:57.150 --> 17:00.351
WE'RE GOING TO
A GOOD RESTAURANT.

17:00.387 --> 17:03.187
YOU DON'T WANT TO EAT
WHERE THERE'S RATS.

17:03.223 --> 17:04.722
I FOUND RATS
IN THE BACK.

17:04.758 --> 17:05.723
HOW DISGUSTING.

17:05.759 --> 17:08.860
OHH! A WHOLE NEST

OBVIOUSLY A SLOB.

17:11.731 --> 17:13.297
THIS IS IT?

17:13.333 --> 17:15.466
THERE'S
THE BARNACLE.

17:15.502 --> 17:17.235
THERE'S THE BOAT
OFF THE DOCK.

17:17.270 --> 17:19.303
THE GUY AT
THE GAS STATION

17:19.339 --> 17:22.373
SAID THE FOOD'S
GREAT.

17:22.409 --> 17:26.811
WELL, IT'S GOT CHARACTER

17:26.846 --> 17:28.479
I DON'T WANT
ANY COMPLAINTS.

17:28.515 --> 17:31.115
LET'S SIT
AND ENJOY OURSELVES.

17:42.595 --> 17:44.195
THIS PLACE SUCKS.

17:45.365 --> 17:47.732
WHERE'D YOU
LEARN THAT?

17:47.767 --> 17:51.436

18:18.264 --> 18:19.831
CAN YOU RECOMMEND
SOMETHING?

18:19.866 --> 18:21.599
