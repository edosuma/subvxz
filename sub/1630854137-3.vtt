00:11.446 --> 00:12.708

00:12.751 --> 00:15.189

00:22.892 --> 00:24.459
<i>These are their stories.</i>

00:26.896 --> 00:28.680
I'm sleeping better.

00:28.724 --> 00:31.683
And how are the feelings
of detachment?

00:31.727 --> 00:33.642
I'm sorry.
Did you say something?

00:37.472 --> 00:40.257
Last session, you talked
about how easy it was for you

00:40.301 --> 00:42.390
to disappear sometimes.

00:42.433 --> 00:48.222
I think you compared it to
a safe room inside of yourself.

00:48.265 --> 00:50.615
It's a place that
feels familiar.

00:50.659 --> 00:52.530
From childhood?

00:52.574 --> 00:54.967
I don't--

00:55.011 --> 00:56.926
Have you filled
that prescription

00:56.969 --> 00:57.883
for antidepressants I gave you?

00:57.927 --> 01:00.147
I'm not taking meds.

01:00.190 --> 01:03.367
Okay.

01:03.411 --> 01:06.196
How are your girls?

01:10.766 --> 01:15.118
It hasn't been easy pretending
like things are normal.

01:15.162 --> 01:18.948
The goal is not normalcy
or to adopt

01:18.991 --> 01:20.950
a façade for our children.

01:20.993 --> 01:23.257
The goal is to do the work.

01:23.300 --> 01:25.694
And to do that, first,
you need to show up.

01:25.737 --> 01:27.043
I know I've missed
a few appointments.

01:27.087 --> 01:30.525
After on-the-job trauma,
there's a protocol.

01:30.568 --> 01:31.743
You miss appointments,

01:31.787 --> 01:34.311
and I'll be forced
to report it.

01:34.355 --> 01:36.357
And if I report it,
there's a good chance

01:36.400 --> 01:38.794
you'll be removed
from active duty.

01:43.494 --> 01:45.235
<i>Music's hottest
young couple,</i>

01:45.279 --> 01:46.845
<i>Nashville songbird
Kelsey Jones</i>

01:46.889 --> 01:48.586
and pop bad boy Austin Boyer

01:48.630 --> 01:51.241
have just hit
30 million followers

01:51.285 --> 01:53.374
on their joint
social media account.

01:53.417 --> 01:55.506
And we've all been there
every step of the way

01:55.550 --> 01:58.248
since they first met
backstage at Coachella.

01:58.292 --> 02:00.163
And here they come right here.

02:00.207 --> 02:04.036
Here they are,
Austin and Kelsey!

02:04.080 --> 02:05.603
Whoo!

02:05.647 --> 02:07.953
Oh, wow, they are looking
so great.

02:07.997 --> 02:10.042
Looking like a vision in pink.

02:10.086 --> 02:11.566
Kelsey, let me
get an interview.

02:11.609 --> 02:14.482
Kelsey, you look gorgeous
as always.

02:14.525 --> 02:16.048
You're a lucky man, Austin.

02:16.092 --> 02:17.572
Aw.

02:17.615 --> 02:19.965
Kelsey,
two albums in two years.

02:20.009 --> 02:22.142
What keeps you motivated?

02:22.185 --> 02:24.753
Honestly,
this guy right here.

02:24.796 --> 02:26.972
The truth is,
we inspire each other.

02:30.411 --> 02:33.370
Sounds like the fans agree.

02:35.807 --> 02:37.809
Hey, babe. Do you mind?

02:37.853 --> 02:39.463
No, of course not.

02:39.507 --> 02:42.423
I'm Max Carter,
here on the red carpet

02:42.466 --> 02:44.033
with Kelsey and Austin,

02:44.076 --> 02:46.122
and we will see
if Academy voters

02:46.166 --> 02:48.646
agree with the fans.

02:48.690 --> 02:51.736
You guys be good
tonight, all right?

02:51.780 --> 02:52.781
Listen to Gigi.

02:52.824 --> 02:54.522
What time are you
coming home?

02:54.565 --> 02:58.308
You will be fast asleep
by the time I get home, okay?

02:58.352 --> 03:01.268
But what about
the noise in our closet?

03:01.311 --> 03:03.313
She thinks there's a monster.

03:03.357 --> 03:04.880
Okay, monster's gone.

03:04.923 --> 03:07.143
And trust me,
it is not coming back.

03:07.187 --> 03:08.753
Not with that monster spray.

03:08.797 --> 03:10.451
You guys have nothing
to worry about.

03:10.494 --> 03:12.017
You girls are safe.

03:12.061 --> 03:13.845
Don't worry about your mom.
She's a hero.

03:13.889 --> 03:16.457
And any monster that comes up
against me in court,

03:16.500 --> 03:18.546
guilty as charged.

03:18.589 --> 03:21.897
And how about we bring home
some fortune cookies?

03:21.940 --> 03:24.552
Okay, I guess
we decided on Chinese, huh?

03:24.595 --> 03:26.728
Okay, be good, girls.

03:26.771 --> 03:28.469
Thank you, Gigi.

Baby, come on.

03:42.744 --> 03:44.224
Hey, guys.

03:44.267 --> 03:46.922
Do this. Ah!
- Hey.

03:46.965 --> 03:48.271
Yo, come here.

03:48.315 --> 03:50.882
Come get next to me, girl.
- All right.

03:50.926 --> 03:52.188
I love this lighting.
- Let's do it. All right.

03:52.232 --> 03:54.451
Okay.

03:54.495 --> 03:56.279
I like that one.
- Baby, come on.

03:56.323 --> 03:57.454
Get in the picture. Come on.

03:57.498 --> 04:00.152
- Don't tell me what to do!
- Ow!

04:00.196 --> 04:02.372
And how about you put on
some clothes next time?

04:02.416 --> 04:04.026
Yo, fam, chill!

04:04.069 --> 04:05.767
Screw you.

04:05.810 --> 04:07.725
Little bitch!

04:07.769 --> 04:09.249
You okay?

04:09.292 --> 04:11.555
Yeah, I'm good.

04:11.599 --> 04:12.948
Think you got room
for gelato?

04:12.991 --> 04:15.167
I know a place right
up the block from here.

04:15.211 --> 04:17.779
- Ooh.
- Come on.

04:17.822 --> 04:19.171
Austin! Ouch!

04:19.215 --> 04:20.216
Let's go.

04:20.260 --> 04:21.913
Austin! Ow!

04:23.132 --> 04:25.265
Let me go.

04:25.308 --> 04:26.396
I mean it.

04:28.311 --> 04:29.443
Yo, you good?

04:29.486 --> 04:31.836
You whack job.
You want to go? Go.

04:31.880 --> 04:33.185
You want to go?

04:33.229 --> 04:34.317
Go.

04:37.364 --> 04:38.974
Hey. Hey, hey, hey.

04:39.017 --> 04:43.457
Excuse me, miss?

04:43.500 --> 04:45.415
Hey, hey. Is everything okay?

04:45.459 --> 04:47.199
I'm a police officer.
Are you okay?

04:47.243 --> 04:49.027
Oh, it's nothing.

04:49.071 --> 04:51.421
My boyfriend and I
just got in a fight.

04:51.465 --> 04:52.640
Drama in the limo?

04:52.683 --> 04:53.554
Yeah.

04:53.597 --> 04:55.382
He ripped your dress.

04:55.425 --> 04:57.949
Oh, yeah, he just--
he got a little drunk.

04:57.993 --> 05:03.303
Was it--is there somebody
that we can call for you?

05:03.346 --> 05:05.653
Uh, I can call an Uber.

05:05.696 --> 05:08.873
Why don't you let us
give you a ride?

05:08.917 --> 05:10.440
I don't really
want to impose.

05:10.484 --> 05:12.529
Nah, it's not a problem.

05:12.573 --> 05:16.011
The car's right there. Come on.
- Yeah.

05:19.101 --> 05:21.103
Austin again.

05:21.146 --> 05:22.713
Give it a rest, dude.

05:22.757 --> 05:26.978
It might be a good idea
for both of you to cool off.

05:27.022 --> 05:28.328
This is what we do.

05:28.371 --> 05:30.330
We fight, make up.

05:30.373 --> 05:32.114
It's our foreplay.

05:32.157 --> 05:35.247
Austin calls it "five play."

05:35.291 --> 05:36.814
Sorry to involve you.

05:36.858 --> 05:38.425
- Yeah, it's not a problem.
- Here.

05:38.468 --> 05:41.471
Give us a call any time
if you need help.

06:04.668 --> 06:07.976
Hey, Amanda.
You did everything you could.

06:08.019 --> 06:11.545
Why does it not
feel like enough?

07:09.254 --> 07:10.865
A greasy taco bag.

07:10.908 --> 07:13.389
Thank you, Fin.
I already had breakfast.

07:13.433 --> 07:16.697
Your little rescue
left this in my car.

07:16.740 --> 07:18.525
Who, Muncy?

07:18.568 --> 07:19.874
She's a millennial.

07:19.917 --> 07:21.005
They're all entitled.

07:21.049 --> 07:22.529
Well, she should
feel entitled

07:22.572 --> 07:24.531
to getting my car detailed
and filling it up with gas.

07:24.574 --> 07:26.489
You're the sergeant, Fin.
Straighten her out.

07:26.533 --> 07:28.012
Me?

07:28.056 --> 07:29.492
You're the one that
wanted her here.

07:29.536 --> 07:33.148
And I want her to stay,
so I can't piss her off.

07:34.541 --> 07:35.629
Door is closed.
What do you think

07:35.672 --> 07:36.760
they're talking about?

07:36.804 --> 07:39.546
Well, judging by
the takeout bag...

07:39.589 --> 07:42.244
Tell me you at least
gassed up the car.

07:46.378 --> 07:49.381
What the hell
is Kelsey Jones doing here?

07:49.425 --> 07:50.731
You listen to that crap?

07:50.774 --> 07:53.560
She sang the national anthem
at the Jets game.

07:53.603 --> 07:54.822
Kelsey.

07:54.865 --> 07:57.085
- Hey.
- Hey.

07:57.128 --> 07:59.783
I didn't think you
knew who I was.

07:59.827 --> 08:02.264
Yeah, I didn't want
to bring it up last night,

08:02.307 --> 08:04.440
but yeah, my daughter
is a huge fan.

08:10.925 --> 08:13.797
Are you okay?

08:13.841 --> 08:15.538
I think--

08:15.582 --> 08:18.149
I think I need to
talk to someone.

08:23.459 --> 08:26.070
Kelsey, this is my captain.

08:26.114 --> 08:27.724
I explained your situation.

08:27.768 --> 08:28.943
Hey.

08:28.986 --> 08:30.422
I appreciate you
listening to me.

08:30.466 --> 08:32.599
I--I don't want to
cause any trouble.

08:32.642 --> 08:35.166
Oh, we're here to help.

08:35.210 --> 08:39.823
So Detective Rollins
tells me that your boyfriend

08:39.867 --> 08:41.216
may have assaulted you.

08:41.259 --> 08:44.611
Yeah, last night.

08:44.654 --> 08:48.223
Okay, you want
to tell me what happened?

08:48.266 --> 08:51.313
He grabbed me,
pulled me into his lap

08:51.356 --> 08:52.749
in the back of the limo.

08:52.793 --> 08:55.578
He ripped my dress
in front of his friends.

08:56.971 --> 08:59.756
I mean, then, we got home,
he wanted to have sex.

08:59.800 --> 09:01.497
I said no.

09:01.541 --> 09:03.978
Well, then,
he couldn't get it up,

09:04.021 --> 09:08.243
and he had so much rage.

09:09.636 --> 09:12.595
And he threw me on the bed,
and I was--

09:12.639 --> 09:16.338
I was really scared.

09:16.381 --> 09:20.647
And then he passed out. So.

09:20.690 --> 09:24.085
I--I don't know, I guess
he didn't really do anything.

09:24.128 --> 09:26.000
Well, from what
you described,

09:26.043 --> 09:28.350
if he touched you in a way

09:28.393 --> 09:30.744
that you didn't want
to be touched, that--

09:30.787 --> 09:33.660
that is a crime.

09:33.703 --> 09:35.357
I don't want him
to go to jail.

09:35.400 --> 09:37.533
I just--I don't want him
to do it again.

09:37.577 --> 09:39.709
So how about
we can investigate,

09:39.753 --> 09:42.146
and then you can decide later
whether or not

09:42.190 --> 09:44.105
you want to file
a police report?

09:45.410 --> 09:48.065
I'm done covering for him.

09:50.633 --> 09:53.549
You know, maybe it's best
that you don't go home tonight.

09:53.593 --> 09:56.683
Is there somebody else
that you can stay with?

09:56.726 --> 09:58.641
I can call my mom.

09:58.685 --> 10:00.338
If I tell her
I'll take her shopping,

10:00.382 --> 10:03.211
she'd probably be
on the next flight.

10:03.254 --> 10:08.172
Well, in the meantime,
maybe stay at a hotel.

10:08.216 --> 10:09.957
Okay.

10:10.000 --> 10:11.741
- Okay.
- I'm sorry.

10:11.785 --> 10:14.396
I think some paparazzi
followed me here.

10:14.439 --> 10:17.704
Is there a back exit?

10:17.747 --> 10:20.054
Yeah, of course.

10:24.798 --> 10:27.409
Yeah, I drove Kelsey
and Austin last night.

10:27.452 --> 10:29.324
What, she called
the cops on him?

10:29.367 --> 10:31.543
Yeah, any reason
she might have done that?

10:31.587 --> 10:33.676
Well, she says she was
assaulted in your limo,

10:33.720 --> 10:36.940
so that kind of
makes you a witness.

10:36.984 --> 10:37.941
I don't want to get involved.

10:37.985 --> 10:40.509
So they did get in a fight?

10:40.552 --> 10:44.208
Look, they might be in
their late 20s on the outside,

10:44.252 --> 10:45.775
but inside,
they're just kids who

10:45.819 --> 10:47.516
can't handle their emotions.

10:47.559 --> 10:51.085
And you add in money, fame,
constant validation--

10:51.128 --> 10:52.303
Right. We get that.

10:52.347 --> 10:54.436
So what happened?

10:54.479 --> 10:58.745
All I want to say,
they need a timeout.

11:00.050 --> 11:01.182
Excuse me.

11:02.966 --> 11:05.752
Kelsey, call me back now.

11:05.795 --> 11:08.493
Look, this is between
me and Kelsey.

11:08.537 --> 11:12.410
Well, actually,
it's between us and Kelsey.

11:12.454 --> 11:14.064
But I do want to hear
your side of it.

11:14.108 --> 11:15.718
Whatever she told you
is a lie.

11:15.762 --> 11:19.200
So her dress
just ripped itself?

11:19.243 --> 11:20.810
She threw
a champagne bottle at me.

11:20.854 --> 11:22.377
I could have lost an eye.

11:22.420 --> 11:24.684
Was that before or after
you threw her down on the bed?

11:29.645 --> 11:32.953
You think
this is funny, Mr. Boyer?

11:32.996 --> 11:37.871
SVU takes these kinds
of allegations very seriously.

11:43.746 --> 11:46.967
You know who else
is gonna take this seriously?

11:47.010 --> 11:48.185
My lawyer.

11:56.585 --> 11:59.414
These "he said, she said"
celebrity cases,

11:59.457 --> 12:00.807
they're difficult to prosecute.

12:00.850 --> 12:03.505
He's gonna hire the best
attorney that money can buy.

12:03.548 --> 12:04.854
So we don't even try?

12:08.336 --> 12:09.772
She's a victim.

12:09.816 --> 12:12.775
Rollins, nobody's saying
that she wasn't victimized.

12:12.819 --> 12:16.692
All I'm saying is, he's
claiming he's a victim, too.

12:16.736 --> 12:18.563
This is gonna come down
to a popularity contest

12:18.607 --> 12:20.609
just to get a jury to convict.

12:20.652 --> 12:24.918
But it is doable, as long as
Kelsey's on board to testify.

12:24.961 --> 12:26.310
Rollins, have you
heard from her?

12:28.878 --> 12:31.489
Rollins?

12:31.533 --> 12:33.927
Have you heard
from our Nashville songbird?

12:33.970 --> 12:36.756
No, I'll give her a call.

12:50.900 --> 12:55.296
Kelsey is a big star now,
but she is a small-town girl.

12:55.339 --> 12:57.733
She grew up in a trailer park
in Kentucky.

12:57.777 --> 13:01.650
You add to that a legacy
of domestic violence--

13:01.693 --> 13:05.697
Well, what I learned
on social media today, Austin,

13:05.741 --> 13:07.830
he didn't have it easy,
either, you know?

13:07.874 --> 13:11.181
Father was an alcoholic.
His mother's in jail.

13:11.225 --> 13:14.010
I mean, it makes sense that
his love language is turmoil.

13:14.054 --> 13:17.013
Opposites attract.
Dysfunction attracts harder.

13:18.667 --> 13:20.756
- You see this? <i>
- And in entertainment news,</i>

13:20.800 --> 13:24.716
<i>Austin Boyer and Kelsey Jones
just made an announcement.</i>

13:26.762 --> 13:28.851
Austin bought her off
with a proposal.

13:28.895 --> 13:31.593
And a tough case
just got impossible.

13:31.636 --> 13:36.380
Oh, my God.

13:36.424 --> 13:37.599
Hey.
What's going on, you guys?

13:37.642 --> 13:38.774
What--what--
what's the matter?

13:38.818 --> 13:40.907
Billie's right.
There is a monster.

13:40.950 --> 13:43.170
No.

13:43.213 --> 13:47.174
Mommy, why do you have a gun?

13:47.217 --> 13:50.133
Mommy, you're scaring us!

13:50.177 --> 13:53.310
It's okay, girls.

13:53.354 --> 13:55.704
Mommy, is it gone?

13:55.747 --> 13:57.271
Amanda.

14:02.189 --> 14:03.886
Mommy, stop.

14:16.464 --> 14:17.857
It's gorgeous, isn't it?

14:17.900 --> 14:19.510
It's--it's big.

14:19.554 --> 14:20.903
That's for sure.

14:20.947 --> 14:22.557
Austin and I talked.

14:22.600 --> 14:25.386
I definitely do not want
to pursue charges.

14:25.429 --> 14:28.780
He's using this engagement
as a sick attempt

14:28.824 --> 14:30.565
to distort your reality.

14:30.608 --> 14:33.873
It looks like it's working.

14:33.916 --> 14:37.267
Every song on my last album
is about Austin.

14:37.311 --> 14:39.182
How am I supposed to perform
those songs

14:39.226 --> 14:41.054
if I have him arrested?
- So this is about your career?

14:41.097 --> 14:42.490
Austin and I are in love.

14:42.533 --> 14:45.014
And he's--he's working
on his anger.

14:45.058 --> 14:46.276
Well, next time--

14:46.320 --> 14:47.843
There's not gonna be
a next time.

14:47.887 --> 14:51.064
Kelsey,
we're just asking you to--

14:51.107 --> 14:53.544
to think about it, okay?

14:55.372 --> 14:56.939
Take that in.

14:56.983 --> 15:00.638
Oh, my little songbird is
supposed to be on vocal rest.

15:00.682 --> 15:04.686
Whoo, she always says that
when she wants me to shut up.

15:04.729 --> 15:05.948
Hi. I'm Lilah.

15:05.992 --> 15:07.907
I'm Kelsey's mother.

15:07.950 --> 15:09.125
Would you ladies
like some wine?

15:09.169 --> 15:11.214
Mom, they are
police officers.

15:11.258 --> 15:13.216
Well, I know that.
I'm just trying to be polite.

15:13.260 --> 15:15.958
Oh, we're good. Thank you.

15:16.002 --> 15:17.960
Suit yourselves.

15:18.004 --> 15:19.092
Kelsey's my everything.

15:19.135 --> 15:20.702
Did you even see her ring?

15:20.745 --> 15:21.877
Bro, that rock is sick.

15:21.921 --> 15:23.618
No doubt.

15:23.661 --> 15:26.099
Yeah, that's got to be,
what, a five-carat apology?

15:26.142 --> 15:27.796
She always this cynical
about love?

15:27.839 --> 15:29.058
Only when it's fake.

15:31.060 --> 15:32.975
Everything's gonna be
perfect between us.

15:33.019 --> 15:35.064
Once her mom leaves.

15:35.108 --> 15:37.675
By the way,
thanks to whichever one of you

15:37.719 --> 15:39.199
told Kelsey to call that bitch.

15:39.242 --> 15:41.288
Don't get me wrong.

15:41.331 --> 15:44.900
I do not think that Austin is
healthy for my little Kelsey,

15:44.944 --> 15:48.991
but mama lion is here now.

15:49.035 --> 15:51.124
We appreciate
your concern, Mrs. Jones.

15:51.167 --> 15:53.169
You should know,
this kind of course of control,

15:53.213 --> 15:54.997
it doesn't have an endpoint.

15:55.041 --> 15:57.347
Victims have a hard time
seeing the abuse.

15:57.391 --> 15:59.219
Austin and I are talking
about making

15:59.262 --> 16:01.351
an album together.
- Baby, vocal rest.

16:01.395 --> 16:02.700
Kelsey--

16:02.744 --> 16:04.354
We want you to know
that we're here for you.

16:04.398 --> 16:06.704
And if you need help,
we're here,

16:06.748 --> 16:09.881
or if you change your mind
about pressing charges,

16:09.925 --> 16:11.057
you call us any time.

16:16.192 --> 16:17.802
Mom's a piece of work.

16:17.846 --> 16:19.630
That kid should be in therapy,
not forced into silence.

16:19.674 --> 16:21.981
A lot of crooked branches
on the family tree.

16:22.024 --> 16:23.721
I ought to know.

16:23.765 --> 16:26.463
Speaking of which, how are
the girls handling everything?

16:26.507 --> 16:29.640
Why?
What did Carisi tell you?

16:29.684 --> 16:31.251
Nothing.

16:31.294 --> 16:34.080
That guy is either plain
stupid, or he's in denial.

16:34.123 --> 16:35.733
Yeah, he did offer tickets
to his tour.

16:35.777 --> 16:37.170
Right, yeah.

16:37.213 --> 16:38.954
I'd rather pass a kidney stone
through my ears.

16:41.652 --> 16:44.003
You two good?

16:44.046 --> 16:46.309
Yeah, all good.

16:51.053 --> 16:52.707
Ah, so the diva
doesn't want to throw

16:52.750 --> 16:54.230
her boyfriend in jail, huh?

16:54.274 --> 16:56.798
Ah, as of right now, no,
she doesn't want to pursue.

16:56.841 --> 16:59.453
Yeah, I'm not surprised
after I saw that rock.

17:01.411 --> 17:05.502
Hey, Muncy,
there are no perfect victims.

17:05.546 --> 17:07.461
There are no
perfect investigators.

17:07.504 --> 17:10.681
Oh, believe me.
I know I'm far from perfect.

17:10.725 --> 17:13.815
Look, I realize that it
wasn't your choice to be here.

17:13.858 --> 17:16.339
Are you having
second thoughts?

17:16.383 --> 17:17.123
Not yet.

17:17.166 --> 17:18.472
You won't.

17:20.169 --> 17:23.172
I like your confidence.

17:23.216 --> 17:26.436
And if you are planning
on sticking around,

17:26.480 --> 17:29.439
you might want to invest
in a--in a blazer.

17:36.055 --> 17:37.447
I'm going to speak to Muncy.

17:37.491 --> 17:39.449
You know, I would
actually hold off for now.

17:39.493 --> 17:42.452
I just gave her a little bit
of wardrobe advice,

17:42.496 --> 17:44.324
and I don't want
to overload her.

17:44.367 --> 17:46.108
Captain,
I'm sorry to interrupt.

17:46.152 --> 17:48.719
Austin Boyer
is here to see you.

17:52.332 --> 17:54.073
Go ahead and have a seat.

17:54.116 --> 17:55.813
Thank you
for meeting me, Captain.

17:55.857 --> 17:57.946
I just want to assure you
that what happened between me

17:57.989 --> 17:59.991
and Kelsey won't happen again.

18:00.035 --> 18:01.210
Okay.

18:01.254 --> 18:02.472
Well, I'm glad to hear that.

18:02.516 --> 18:04.909
And my lawyer
says the charges

18:04.953 --> 18:06.128
still haven't been dropped.

18:06.172 --> 18:07.564
Why you're really here.

18:07.608 --> 18:10.437
Can you
blame a guy for trying?

18:12.265 --> 18:14.049
I want to do the right thing.

18:14.093 --> 18:16.225
And I appreciate that, Austin,

18:16.269 --> 18:20.621
but it's not up to you,
or Kelsey, or me.

18:20.664 --> 18:22.318
It's up to the DA now.

18:22.362 --> 18:25.321
I went to my
first meeting today.

18:25.365 --> 18:27.367
I want to get sober.

18:31.110 --> 18:34.809
You know, we all
have choices to make.

18:34.852 --> 18:36.680
And the kind of change
that you're talking about,

18:36.724 --> 18:40.031
real change, Austin,
has less to do

18:40.075 --> 18:42.991
with what you put
in the glass and more

18:43.034 --> 18:46.125
to do with emotional maturity.

18:46.168 --> 18:49.171
Now, I'm guessing that
you didn't have

18:49.215 --> 18:52.305
the greatest role models
growing up.

18:52.348 --> 18:55.656
My advice to you
is whatever it is

18:55.699 --> 19:01.183
that you were taught
about being a man,

19:01.227 --> 19:03.316
do the opposite.

19:06.493 --> 19:08.799
Let me guess, Austin was here
doing damage control?

19:08.843 --> 19:12.063
You know, I think that
he actually wants to heal.

19:12.107 --> 19:15.632
Well, if he figures that out,
I'll buy his self-help book.

19:15.676 --> 19:17.156
Detective Rollins.

19:17.199 --> 19:18.157
Whoa.

19:18.200 --> 19:20.507
Lilah, slow down.

19:20.550 --> 19:23.205
- Take it easy, Mrs. Jones.
- No one's listening to me.

19:23.249 --> 19:25.729
I'm telling you.
He hurt my baby.

19:25.773 --> 19:27.557
She called me crying.
I came right over.

19:27.601 --> 19:28.906
She wants
to cause trouble again.

19:28.950 --> 19:30.169
It's what she does.

19:30.212 --> 19:31.300
Stay out of our business!

19:31.344 --> 19:32.519
Hey, what--what happened?

19:32.562 --> 19:33.868
You need to be locked up!

19:33.911 --> 19:35.348
You're the one that
needs to be locked up,

19:35.391 --> 19:36.914
you psycho-ass, bipolar bitch!

19:36.958 --> 19:38.177
Stop calling me that!

19:38.220 --> 19:39.743
Whoa, whoa, hey!

19:39.787 --> 19:41.223
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

19:41.267 --> 19:43.094
Okay, both of you
are coming with us.

19:43.138 --> 19:44.487
- What? I'm under arrest?
- You want to be?

19:44.531 --> 19:45.749
Go ahead. Take her away.

19:45.793 --> 19:47.577
She's not exactly
going alone, cowboy.

19:47.621 --> 19:49.100
Come on.

19:51.668 --> 19:56.804
Austin and I got
into a fight at the restaurant.

19:59.023 --> 20:01.287
It was my mother's fault.

20:01.330 --> 20:02.940
Tell us what happened.

20:02.984 --> 20:05.247
Austin thought that
I took my mother's side,

20:05.291 --> 20:07.336
and so he left
the restaurant angry.

20:09.295 --> 20:15.083
And by the time we got home,

20:15.126 --> 20:17.128
it was a full-blown war.

20:17.172 --> 20:19.218
A physical one?

20:21.132 --> 20:22.525
He got what
he wanted this time.

20:22.569 --> 20:24.223
I--I tried to fight him off.

20:24.266 --> 20:25.702
I said no.

20:32.318 --> 20:33.971
Austin raped me.

20:51.337 --> 20:53.861
Austin was flirting
with that waitress,

20:53.904 --> 20:55.732
and Kelsey was just pretending
that she didn't mind.

20:55.776 --> 20:56.951
But you did.

20:56.994 --> 20:59.780
I minded for her.

20:59.823 --> 21:03.131
Sometimes diamonds
just make a girl go blind.

21:03.174 --> 21:05.133
Her mother called me
a pathetic little prick,

21:05.176 --> 21:07.483
loudly, in front of everyone.

21:07.527 --> 21:08.615
Did she have a reason?

21:08.658 --> 21:10.181
Yeah, I was being nice
to the waitress.

21:10.225 --> 21:11.835
The girl's a fan.
Is that a crime?

21:11.879 --> 21:13.750
Well, how about when you
and Kelsey got home?

21:13.794 --> 21:16.231
Austin kept calling
my mother names.

21:16.275 --> 21:19.278
And he was going at her.

21:19.321 --> 21:21.802
He was pretty drunk.

21:21.845 --> 21:23.804
To be fair,
I had some drinks too.

21:23.847 --> 21:26.633
Well, that--
that doesn't matter.

21:26.676 --> 21:29.984
So how did it escalate?

21:30.027 --> 21:31.768
We both were
pretty turned on.

21:31.812 --> 21:32.943
Things got kind of rough.

21:32.987 --> 21:34.380
That would cause the bruises?

21:34.423 --> 21:36.947
Part of our foreplay,
dial it up a notch.

21:36.991 --> 21:40.473
We fight, tear each other's
clothes off, have hot sex.

21:40.516 --> 21:42.779
Oh, so you did have sex?

21:42.823 --> 21:45.913
Did he do or say
anything afterwards?

21:45.956 --> 21:51.266
He just got up,

21:51.310 --> 21:53.268
went to the balcony
for a smoke.

21:55.575 --> 21:58.273
Like nothing was wrong.

21:59.840 --> 22:01.363
Austin's lawyer is here.

22:01.407 --> 22:03.365
I'm assuming you've
Mirandized my client.

22:03.409 --> 22:04.584
We did.

22:04.627 --> 22:05.976
He said he wanted
to explain what happened.

22:06.020 --> 22:09.371
Austin, not another word.

22:12.548 --> 22:14.028
He admitted to rough sex.

22:14.071 --> 22:16.030
And Kelsey insists
it was not consensual.

22:16.073 --> 22:17.466
Rollins took her
to get a rape kit.

22:17.510 --> 22:18.989
Mother confirms her story.

22:19.033 --> 22:20.643
And we're sure Kelsey
is not gonna backtrack again?

22:20.687 --> 22:22.341
Well, let's say
that she doesn't.

22:22.384 --> 22:24.212
Do we have enough?

22:24.255 --> 22:26.954
Admission from him,
victim's word, outcry witness?

22:26.997 --> 22:28.695
Yeah, arrest him.

22:28.738 --> 22:30.392
In the meantime, wish me luck.

22:30.436 --> 22:33.439
The DA's office
is already getting calls.

22:33.482 --> 22:35.789
Oh, the paparazzi
took a photo of Austin

22:35.832 --> 22:37.268
in the back of the squad car.

22:43.666 --> 22:48.671
Charges of rape one, sexual
assault one, and rape three.

22:48.715 --> 22:49.716
How do you plead?

22:49.759 --> 22:51.370
Not guilty, Your Honor.

22:51.413 --> 22:52.806
The people on bail?

22:52.849 --> 22:55.243
100,000 and the defendant
surrenders his passport.

22:55.286 --> 22:57.376
My client isn't
a flight risk.

22:57.419 --> 22:59.247
He's a highly
recognizable public figure

22:59.290 --> 23:00.988
who couldn't hide if he tries

23:01.031 --> 23:03.251
and only wants to prove
his innocence.

23:03.294 --> 23:05.514
We also request
no photography, Your Honor.

23:05.558 --> 23:06.994
Freedom of the press.

23:07.037 --> 23:08.299
I'm aware of the law.

23:08.343 --> 23:10.606
Details of this case
have already gone viral.

23:10.650 --> 23:13.435
Mr. Boyer has over
40 million followers online.

23:13.479 --> 23:15.524
The complainant
has almost as many.

23:15.568 --> 23:19.485
I'm warning both parties
to stay off social media,

23:19.528 --> 23:21.878
but I can't ban the press.

23:21.922 --> 23:23.924
Bail is set at 100,000.

23:23.967 --> 23:26.230
Passport surrendered.

23:31.366 --> 23:35.109
Mr. Carisi,
I'm Austin's father.

23:35.152 --> 23:36.632
How can I help you?

23:36.676 --> 23:39.766
Austin's not guilty of what
you're charging him with.

23:39.809 --> 23:41.420
He's a drunk.

23:41.463 --> 23:42.725
That's all.

23:42.769 --> 23:44.423
It's a curse he gets from me.

23:44.466 --> 23:46.903
People wind up in this court
because of their choices,

23:46.947 --> 23:50.820
Mr. Boyer, not their excuses.

23:59.960 --> 24:02.310
Austin, did you do this?

24:02.353 --> 24:04.530
My client intends to prove
his innocence in court.

24:04.573 --> 24:06.270
Austin, what do you say
to your fans?

24:06.314 --> 24:07.794
Thank you for your support,
and trust me.

24:07.837 --> 24:09.012
<i>The truth will come out.</i>

24:11.841 --> 24:14.148
The circus begins.

24:14.191 --> 24:16.324
How's--how's Kelsey doing?

24:16.367 --> 24:19.370
Benson and I convinced her
and her media consultant

24:19.414 --> 24:21.416
not to go on the offensive.
- That's great.

24:21.460 --> 24:24.288
That's great.
I'll see you at home?

24:24.332 --> 24:27.509
Uh. Uh.

24:27.553 --> 24:31.034
The girls are still
with my mom.

24:34.560 --> 24:37.127
You mind if I wait?

24:37.171 --> 24:39.565
It's--it's gonna be late.

24:39.608 --> 24:40.827
I'm prepping for trial.

24:40.870 --> 24:43.438
I don't want
to be alone right now.

24:43.482 --> 24:44.613
Of course.

24:46.963 --> 24:49.749
But I'm gonna bore the hell
out of you within a half hour.

24:49.792 --> 24:52.360
Boring sounds really good.

24:54.405 --> 24:56.886
It's about all I can
handle right now.

25:04.241 --> 25:07.288
Kelsey called me at my hotel.

25:07.331 --> 25:09.943
She could barely talk,
she was crying so hard.

25:09.986 --> 25:13.424
And I immediately
jumped into a cab.

25:13.468 --> 25:16.863
And when you got to the
apartment, what did you see?

25:16.906 --> 25:18.560
Kelsey was in the bedroom,

25:18.604 --> 25:23.870
and Austin was drunk, angry.

25:23.913 --> 25:28.527
And my little girl told me that
he had sexually assaulted her.

25:30.180 --> 25:32.226
The room was a wreck.

25:32.269 --> 25:36.926
Kelsey's bruises,
her nightgown--

25:36.970 --> 25:38.145
I just knew.

25:40.147 --> 25:42.932
Thank you.

25:42.976 --> 25:48.895
Mrs. Jones, has your daughter
ever told you something

25:48.938 --> 25:50.549
you don't believe?

25:52.202 --> 25:56.293
Defense exhibit A,
a police report filed in 2015

25:56.337 --> 25:57.947
in Maysville, Kentucky.

25:57.991 --> 26:01.255
Can you contextualize that
for the jury?

26:01.298 --> 26:05.912
Kelsey called
the cops on my boyfriend

26:05.955 --> 26:09.785
at the time, Dennis--Bruce.

26:09.829 --> 26:11.918
Alleging?

26:11.961 --> 26:14.616
That he molested her.

26:14.660 --> 26:17.663
It was a--it was
a misunderstanding.

26:17.706 --> 26:21.362
She was 17 years old,
and she was angry at me

26:21.405 --> 26:23.407
for not going to LA with her

26:23.451 --> 26:28.108
to audition for some teen soap.

26:28.151 --> 26:32.503
So you didn't believe her?

26:32.547 --> 26:34.418
Of course not.
I read it in her journal.

26:34.462 --> 26:35.942
That thing was full of lies.

26:35.985 --> 26:37.465
- Objection.
- Sustained.

26:37.508 --> 26:39.598
She would write made-up
stories in that journal

26:39.641 --> 26:41.600
all the time just to mess
with me because

26:41.643 --> 26:42.644
she knew I was snooping.

26:42.688 --> 26:43.689
Your Honor.

26:43.732 --> 26:47.040
Sustained.
Jury will disregard.

26:47.083 --> 26:48.955
Nothing further.

26:58.704 --> 27:00.488
Kelsey, are you
lying about Austin?

27:00.531 --> 27:02.533
- What? What do they mean?
- Back up.

27:02.577 --> 27:04.144
Why does everybody
suddenly hate me?

27:04.187 --> 27:05.188
Not another word
to the press.

27:05.232 --> 27:06.668
Not another word.

27:06.712 --> 27:07.974
Baby, they made me say
those things in there.

27:08.017 --> 27:09.105
What things?

27:09.149 --> 27:10.367
Focus on your testimony.

27:13.414 --> 27:16.896
Austin and I were together
for three years.

27:16.939 --> 27:18.506
We connected through music.

27:18.549 --> 27:21.074
You got engaged,
but then you broke it off.

27:21.117 --> 27:22.423
Why was that?

27:22.466 --> 27:25.078
Our relationship
had always been turbulent,

27:25.121 --> 27:27.733
but recently, things got worse.

27:27.776 --> 27:31.998
He was verbally
and physically abusive,

27:32.041 --> 27:34.261
and I admit, I was too.

27:34.304 --> 27:35.697
What about the night
in question?

27:35.741 --> 27:37.743
Well, we got in a fight
at dinner.

27:37.786 --> 27:40.833
And when we got home,

27:40.876 --> 27:43.226
I was too angry to have sex.

27:43.270 --> 27:48.014
And he physically overpowered
and raped me.

27:48.057 --> 27:50.277
My mother called the police.

27:50.320 --> 27:53.019
Now you had been
to the police before

27:53.062 --> 27:55.151
with a complaint
against the defendant.

27:55.195 --> 27:57.240
Yes, he assaulted me
in a limo.

27:57.284 --> 27:59.068
But you decided
not to cooperate.

27:59.112 --> 28:01.549
Why?

28:01.592 --> 28:03.072
I thought he would change.

28:07.076 --> 28:08.556
Thank you.

28:08.599 --> 28:11.385
So it's safe to say
you changed your mind

28:11.428 --> 28:13.953
about the prior
alleged assault?

28:13.996 --> 28:15.041
Yes.

28:15.084 --> 28:16.390
The night he gave you a ring?

28:16.433 --> 28:17.957
That had nothing
to do with it.

28:18.000 --> 28:19.872
The timing was convenient.

28:19.915 --> 28:22.352
What will it take
to change your mind this time?

28:22.396 --> 28:24.050
Six carats, seven?

28:24.093 --> 28:26.052
- Objection.
- I just wanted his love.

28:26.095 --> 28:27.140
- You're a liar!
- Your Honor.

28:27.183 --> 28:28.315
You're a liar!

28:28.358 --> 28:29.533
Why are you lying?
- I did love him.

28:29.577 --> 28:30.883
Why are you
lying about Austin?

28:30.926 --> 28:33.537
- I do love him.
- Bailiff, get her out of here.

28:33.581 --> 28:35.714
- Bailiff.
- He would never hurt you.

28:35.757 --> 28:37.585
What is wrong with you?
- Bailiff!

28:37.628 --> 28:39.065
Why are you trying
to hurt him?

28:39.108 --> 28:40.153
Court's in recess.

28:51.947 --> 28:52.905
That's her!

28:52.948 --> 28:54.776
She had Austin arrested.

28:54.820 --> 28:56.125
What is wrong with you?

28:56.169 --> 28:57.823
Why are you lying
about him, huh?

28:57.866 --> 28:59.433
Why are you taking her side?

28:59.476 --> 29:00.913
Why are you lying about Austin?

29:00.956 --> 29:03.219
What did he ever do to you?

29:03.263 --> 29:05.787
Austin would never
hurt anybody.

29:05.831 --> 29:07.093
He wouldn't hurt a fly.

29:07.136 --> 29:08.268
What's wrong with you, huh?

29:08.311 --> 29:10.400
Why are you lying about him?

29:19.235 --> 29:21.455
Your Honor, I'm asking that
we try this case

29:21.498 --> 29:23.587
in a courtroom
and not on social media.

29:23.631 --> 29:25.111
My client is also
a public figure.

29:25.154 --> 29:27.330
Your client's supporters
showed up wearing red pants.

29:27.374 --> 29:29.593
Liar, liar, pants on fire?
This is ridiculous.

29:29.637 --> 29:30.899
Mr. Carisi feels their

29:30.943 --> 29:33.075
wardrobe choices
are tainting the jury.

29:33.119 --> 29:35.077
If that's the case, Your Honor,
we move for a mistrial.

29:35.121 --> 29:37.036
I'm not granting
a mistrial,

29:37.079 --> 29:39.125
and I can't
close the courtroom.

29:39.168 --> 29:43.216
But I can ban
misbehaving individuals,

29:43.259 --> 29:46.306
including ones
wearing red pants.

29:48.134 --> 29:49.700
We both know
it's not the cameras.

29:49.744 --> 29:51.093
This never should
have gone to trial.

29:51.137 --> 29:52.965
Then tell your client
to take a deal.

29:58.100 --> 30:00.886
These TikTok trolls,
they're raking up

30:00.929 --> 30:03.236
millions of likes
off of smearing me.

30:03.279 --> 30:06.021
- Maybe stay off your phone.
- So Carisi got the judge

30:06.065 --> 30:07.414
to keep the fans
out of the courtroom.

30:07.457 --> 30:09.285
It doesn't matter.
My career is already ruined.

30:09.329 --> 30:11.635
You know,
you need to toughen up.

30:11.679 --> 30:13.072
Detective Rollins.

30:15.030 --> 30:16.727
Can you give us a minute?

30:26.346 --> 30:30.654
My son, Austin, always
had an addiction problem--

30:30.698 --> 30:33.657
drinking, drugs, women.

30:33.701 --> 30:35.224
He forgot to add
media attention.

30:35.268 --> 30:37.661
He's not helping
his son's case at all.

30:39.838 --> 30:43.450
Yeah, Austin! Yeah!

30:43.493 --> 30:45.713
Austin, we're on your side!

30:47.236 --> 30:50.370
I guess we all
have our issues.

30:50.413 --> 30:53.416
Speaking of which, Amanda.

30:53.460 --> 30:55.418
Yeah. Don't worry.

30:55.462 --> 30:57.159
I'm driving her to therapy
from now on.

30:57.203 --> 30:58.334
Okay.

30:58.378 --> 31:00.597
I'll wait outside
if I have to.

31:00.641 --> 31:01.903
That's real love.

31:01.947 --> 31:04.906
Yeah, it's mostly
about running errands.

31:09.563 --> 31:10.999
Should she be here?

31:11.043 --> 31:12.827
She asked if she could
come to the courtroom

31:12.871 --> 31:14.350
for Austin's testimony.

31:14.394 --> 31:16.875
I told her, not a great idea,
but I couldn't stop her.

31:16.918 --> 31:21.357
Couldn't or didn't want to?

31:28.843 --> 31:31.063
I'm the first to admit
that our relationship

31:31.106 --> 31:34.849
has been unmanageable--

31:34.893 --> 31:36.372
verbal abuse.

31:36.416 --> 31:39.767
It's gotten physical
on both sides.

31:41.247 --> 31:43.945
But I did not
sexually assault Kelsey.

31:43.989 --> 31:47.383
I never have,
and I never would.

31:47.427 --> 31:49.168
Thank you, Austin.

31:54.608 --> 31:58.612
Mr. Boyer,
that night at the restaurant,

31:58.655 --> 31:59.787
you and Kelsey
got into a fight?

31:59.830 --> 32:01.658
Yes.

32:01.702 --> 32:04.618
And that fight continued
when you got home?

32:04.661 --> 32:06.272
Yes, I've said all that.

32:06.315 --> 32:07.577
You smacked her around
a little bit.

32:07.621 --> 32:08.970
Objection.

32:09.014 --> 32:10.624
It's the defendant's
own words, Your Honor.

32:10.667 --> 32:12.974
I'll allow.

32:13.018 --> 32:14.715
Yeah, it got physical.

32:14.758 --> 32:15.934
You pushed her
against the wall.

32:15.977 --> 32:17.761
- Yeah.
- You threw her on the bed.

32:17.805 --> 32:19.067
It's what we do.

32:19.111 --> 32:21.548
Yeah, it's what you call
"five play," right?

32:21.591 --> 32:23.637
The jury's seen photos
of the bruises.

32:23.680 --> 32:25.421
Yeah, okay.

32:25.465 --> 32:28.076
Was tearing her nightgown
a part of that?

32:28.120 --> 32:29.599
Yes, by accident.

32:29.643 --> 32:32.472
And when you forced yourself
on her sexually--

32:32.515 --> 32:34.778
She's my fiancée.

32:38.478 --> 32:39.827
So what?

32:39.870 --> 32:42.438
That means she can't say no?

32:42.482 --> 32:43.787
You held her down.

32:43.831 --> 32:46.268
You ripped off her nightgown.
She was pinned.

32:46.312 --> 32:50.142
Does that not sound like
the definition of rape to you?

32:50.185 --> 32:52.448
I know how it sounds,
but context matters.

32:52.492 --> 32:54.102
Oh, so your father
was wrong then, huh?

32:54.146 --> 32:56.104
You're nothing like him?
- That's right.

32:56.148 --> 32:58.280
A man who drank,
who beat your mother.

32:58.324 --> 33:00.413
That's a family pattern
that provides

33:00.456 --> 33:02.284
a context all its own.

33:02.328 --> 33:05.287
Maybe you don't know
what normal is.

33:05.331 --> 33:06.158
Objection.

33:06.201 --> 33:08.943
I am not my father.

33:08.987 --> 33:11.337
Kelsey, I never meant
to hurt you.

33:11.380 --> 33:12.642
I swear to God.

33:12.686 --> 33:13.992
You want me to say it out loud?

33:14.035 --> 33:16.820
I was controlling,
I lost my temper.

33:16.864 --> 33:17.996
I attacked you.

33:18.039 --> 33:20.868
I'm sorry.

33:20.911 --> 33:25.003
There, I said it. I'm sorry.

33:25.046 --> 33:29.050
More than my father
ever gave me.

33:36.014 --> 33:38.146
No further questions.

33:56.425 --> 33:58.166
He said he was sorry,
and you saw him.

33:58.210 --> 33:59.602
He really meant it.

33:59.646 --> 34:01.300
I'm sure that he does.

34:01.343 --> 34:02.518
Look, I want this
over with, okay?

34:02.562 --> 34:03.998
I want my life
to go back to normal.

34:04.042 --> 34:06.305
The DA can't just
drop the charges.

34:06.348 --> 34:07.871
And his lawyer
won't take a deal.

34:07.915 --> 34:11.701
Kelsey,
he sexually assaulted you.

34:11.745 --> 34:14.530
Now, whether or not
you choose to forgive him,

34:14.574 --> 34:16.576
that is up to you, right?

34:16.619 --> 34:19.709
Every survivor
heals differently.

34:19.753 --> 34:25.063
But what happens to Austin,
that's up to a jury now.

34:31.982 --> 34:34.985
This is a classic case
of "he said, she said,"

34:35.029 --> 34:38.250
and the "she"
has a history of lying,

34:38.293 --> 34:43.037
a history of confabulating
accusations about men.

34:43.081 --> 34:46.693
My client isn't perfect,
by any means.

34:46.736 --> 34:48.608
He may be guilty
of certain things,

34:48.651 --> 34:51.350
but not the crime
he's been accused of,

34:51.393 --> 34:53.221
despite what he said
on the stand

34:53.265 --> 34:57.660
in an emotional attempt
to win Kelsey Jones back.

35:03.231 --> 35:05.712
Make no mistake.

35:05.755 --> 35:08.932
What you witnessed here
in this courtroom

35:08.976 --> 35:10.630
are two people
who have suffered

35:10.673 --> 35:14.329
grievous and unbearable
childhood trauma.

35:14.373 --> 35:20.988
But you also witnessed Austin
Boyer confess on the stand.

35:21.031 --> 35:22.946
Yeah, he needs help.

35:22.990 --> 35:26.167
And I sincerely hope he gets
the help that he needs...

35:27.516 --> 35:30.171
In prison.

35:30.215 --> 35:32.956
Because past demons
and claims of love

35:33.000 --> 35:37.613
are not, and never will be,
an excuse for sexual assault.

35:54.456 --> 35:57.459
Okay, thank you.

35:57.503 --> 35:58.982
Yeah.
- Hey, you got a minute?

36:01.507 --> 36:02.725
Of course.

36:05.598 --> 36:07.165
What's up?

36:09.863 --> 36:14.041
I know I've been a bit
off my game lately.

36:14.084 --> 36:18.132
Well, for what it's worth,
Rollins, at the end of the day,

36:18.176 --> 36:21.440
you off your game
is ten times better

36:21.483 --> 36:23.093
than most detectives on theirs.

36:23.137 --> 36:25.705
I pulled my gun in Jesse and
Billie's room the other night.

36:28.229 --> 36:29.970
They were right there.

36:34.192 --> 36:35.671
I--I was--

36:35.715 --> 36:39.675
I was pointing at a monster
in their closet.

36:42.374 --> 36:44.506
Did you get him?

36:46.682 --> 36:51.252
Not yet, but I will.

36:51.296 --> 36:53.036
Good.

37:00.218 --> 37:02.829
Has the jury
reached a verdict?

37:02.872 --> 37:04.309
We have, Your Honor.

37:04.352 --> 37:07.007
On the charge of rape
in the first degree,

37:07.050 --> 37:09.575
we find the defendant
not guilty.

37:09.618 --> 37:13.318
Sexual assault in the first,
not guilty.

37:13.361 --> 37:17.757
Rape in the third degree,
we find the defendant guilty.

37:25.895 --> 37:28.028
Okay. It's okay. Go ahead.

37:33.033 --> 37:35.862
The jury did not find
Austin Boyer guilty

37:35.905 --> 37:38.821
of the two more serious charges
of sexual assault,

37:38.865 --> 37:41.563
splitting the baby with a
guilty verdict on the charge

37:41.607 --> 37:44.305
of rape in the third degree,
a felony,

37:44.349 --> 37:46.699
which will also land
the superstar entertainer

37:46.742 --> 37:48.614
on the National Sex Registry.

37:48.657 --> 37:50.703
You proud of yourself?

37:50.746 --> 37:51.704
Step back.

38:05.370 --> 38:06.545
How you doing?

38:06.588 --> 38:08.416
What's gonna happen
to Austin?

38:08.460 --> 38:11.071
Well, that's up to the judge.

38:11.114 --> 38:14.770
He'll either do prison time
or probation

38:14.814 --> 38:17.730
if he agrees to abide
by certain conditions--

38:17.773 --> 38:20.385
anger management, rehab.

38:20.428 --> 38:22.300
And what do I do?

38:22.343 --> 38:23.431
How am I supposed to tour?

38:23.475 --> 38:24.824
How am I supposed
to sing those songs?

38:24.867 --> 38:26.913
Those songs were
all about our love.

38:26.956 --> 38:31.178
Kelsey, what you two had,
that wasn't love.

38:33.093 --> 38:36.183
And you're gonna write
new songs.

38:39.969 --> 38:44.757
You know, you might want to try

38:44.800 --> 38:46.628
to be alone for a while.

38:49.675 --> 38:53.809
You need to learn
to love yourself

38:53.853 --> 38:56.551
before you can love
anyone else.

39:02.252 --> 39:04.864
Just so you know,
we're planning to appeal.

39:04.907 --> 39:06.692
That's your right.

39:06.735 --> 39:08.781
I can recommend leniency
from the judge,

39:08.824 --> 39:10.478
as long as your client
sticks to his commitment.

39:10.522 --> 39:12.393
I'll do the prison time.

39:12.437 --> 39:13.786
I just want this to be over.

39:13.829 --> 39:16.136
We don't always
get what we want.

39:16.179 --> 39:17.180
We're appealing.

39:20.270 --> 39:24.231
Do you think Kelsey
will take me back

39:24.274 --> 39:27.016
if I do anger management,
all of that?

39:27.060 --> 39:29.236
Son.

39:29.279 --> 39:30.280
It's over.

39:31.934 --> 39:33.458
And I don't know
who you've been taking

39:33.501 --> 39:36.417
your romantic advice from,
but I would seriously consider

39:36.461 --> 39:38.898
losing them from your life.

39:59.788 --> 40:03.792
I never thought

40:03.836 --> 40:06.099
I was capable of having

40:06.142 --> 40:09.363
a healthy relationship.

40:09.407 --> 40:10.843
And now that I have one--

40:10.886 --> 40:13.672
You're afraid
you're gonna mess it all up.

40:13.715 --> 40:17.415
I'm afraid
that I already have.

40:17.458 --> 40:19.808
Really, you haven't.

40:22.289 --> 40:23.333
Are you sure?

40:27.120 --> 40:28.382
Look...

40:30.210 --> 40:32.691
Everybody's got monsters
in their closet.

40:32.734 --> 40:34.432
The question is...

40:39.219 --> 40:41.264
What do you want
to do about it?

40:43.266 --> 40:48.663
I want to evict
the little bastard.

40:55.757 --> 40:57.846
It's gonna be okay.

40:57.890 --> 40:59.674
Sure.
