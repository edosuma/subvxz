00:15.875 --> 00:19.666
Let me tell you about
who first seduced us to do evil.

00:22.791 --> 00:25.916
Lucifer,
to set himself in glory,

00:26.083 --> 00:30.625
raised war in heaven against
the throne and monarchy of God.

00:31.708 --> 00:34.125
Defeated by
the archangel Michael,

00:34.291 --> 00:38.375
this fallen angel was cast
headlong into the lower realm.

00:50.458 --> 00:53.125
Flaming as he fell through
the ethereal sky.

01:00.875 --> 01:03.625
Down to bottomless damnation.

01:07.041 --> 01:10.250
There to dwell
in unbreakable chains.

01:11.666 --> 01:14.000
And punishing fire.

01:28.000 --> 01:29.541
Shit.

01:40.041 --> 01:41.250
Lucifer!

01:59.625 --> 02:02.500
Is this really necessary?

02:09.916 --> 02:11.708
Unchain me!

02:11.875 --> 02:13.750
Michael!

02:15.250 --> 02:18.208
Return as my ally and devoted
angel of the kingdom.

02:18.375 --> 02:21.708
Better to reign in hell
than serve in heaven.

02:24.666 --> 02:26.166
Michael!

02:28.000 --> 02:31.541
I will one day shake free
and rise from these ashes.

02:31.708 --> 02:34.916
I will return to you
but not as your ally,

02:35.083 --> 02:36.375
nor your brother.

02:36.541 --> 02:39.333
I shall return to you
as your master,

02:39.500 --> 02:42.833
your creator,
your God!

03:17.958 --> 03:19.833
Over time,

03:20.000 --> 03:23.083
legions of demons
joined Lucifer in hell

03:23.250 --> 03:25.458
as he plots his revenge.

03:40.041 --> 03:43.041
On Earth, his disciples
erect a stronghold

03:43.208 --> 03:46.458
to guard where Lucifer fell,
believing one day

03:46.625 --> 03:49.458
he will rise through
this gateway to hell.

03:52.541 --> 03:54.041
And rule our world.

04:23.541 --> 04:24.500
Professor Russo!

04:27.916 --> 04:29.125
Yes, Laura?

04:29.291 --> 04:32.041
Please reconsider
approving my thesis.

04:32.208 --> 04:33.750
The last thing
the Turin University

04:33.916 --> 04:36.208
wants to hear is
a young American lecturing us

04:36.375 --> 04:38.458
on what our great
Italian artists believed

04:38.625 --> 04:39.666
or didn't believe.

04:39.833 --> 04:41.333
I'm simply saying
that the artists

04:41.500 --> 04:43.791
who filled your cathedrals
with angels and devils

04:43.958 --> 04:45.833
knew they weren't real,
you know.

04:46.000 --> 04:47.708
Like no actual good spirits
from above

04:47.875 --> 04:50.250
or evil spirits from below.

04:50.416 --> 04:52.166
There is no dark side.

04:52.333 --> 04:54.666
- No dark side?
- Yeah.

04:54.833 --> 04:56.791
Your thesis makes
for a boring movie

04:56.958 --> 04:58.875
and an arrogant dissertation.

04:59.041 --> 05:00.375
The answer is no.

05:00.541 --> 05:02.875
Please, Dr. Russo,
can't we discuss this?

05:07.000 --> 05:10.500
Why don't we discuss it later
at my apartment?

05:11.791 --> 05:15.083
I prefer crowded large
open spaces.

05:17.166 --> 05:18.541
Is that why you wear
a wedding band?

05:18.708 --> 05:20.958
To keep us Italian men at bay?

05:21.125 --> 05:22.750
It's obviously not working.

05:26.916 --> 05:29.625
The DNA of Jesus of Nazareth
will be on display this week

05:29.791 --> 05:31.500
in Turin, Italy.

05:31.666 --> 05:33.458
Hundreds of thousands
will flock to witness

05:33.625 --> 05:35.833
this historic event
as the Shroud of Turin,

05:36.000 --> 05:38.208
the burial cloth of Jesus,
is unveiled.

05:38.375 --> 05:39.875
Accompanying the Shroud
will be renowned

05:40.041 --> 05:41.750
art work and sculptures
provided by the

05:41.916 --> 05:43.541
Vatican Historical Society.

05:43.708 --> 05:44.708
Thanks again.

05:44.875 --> 05:45.750
Thank you for coming to church.

05:45.916 --> 05:46.958
- Thank you.
- Ciao.

05:47.125 --> 05:47.666
- Yes, thank you.
- Ciao, thank you.

05:47.833 --> 05:48.791
Thank you.

05:49.875 --> 05:51.125
- Laura.
- Hey.

05:51.291 --> 05:53.083
- How's my art historian?
- Good.

05:53.250 --> 05:54.125
Wonderful.

05:54.291 --> 05:55.250
You won't be disappointed.

05:55.416 --> 05:56.625
Here, you'll need this today.

05:56.791 --> 05:57.458
Added security
for the exhibition.

05:57.625 --> 06:00.083
Oh, nice.

06:01.458 --> 06:03.458
Everyone is very excited.

06:03.625 --> 06:05.250
There's only been
five showings of the Shroud

06:05.416 --> 06:06.375
in the last 100 years.

06:06.541 --> 06:07.750
Yeah, good crowd.

06:07.916 --> 06:09.291
Ooh, sorry.

06:10.791 --> 06:12.833
- Thank you.

06:17.416 --> 06:20.708
Welcome to the exhibition
of the Shroud of Christ.

06:20.875 --> 06:24.541
The world's most famous object
and most sacred.

06:24.708 --> 06:26.250
Can you come here, please?

06:26.416 --> 06:27.666
Before we go in
to see the Shroud,

06:29.375 --> 06:30.458
I want to show you all
the images up close,

06:30.625 --> 06:31.791
so that you get
a better idea of

06:31.958 --> 06:33.291
what they look like.

06:33.458 --> 06:35.625
So here we have
Christ's blood

06:35.791 --> 06:37.625
from His crucifixion.

06:37.791 --> 06:40.416
His image
from the resurrection.

06:40.583 --> 06:43.833
We believe that Jesus died,
was buried,

06:44.000 --> 06:45.000
and descended to the dead.

06:45.166 --> 06:47.250
On the third day, he rose.

06:47.416 --> 06:49.291
Intense bright light
emitted from his body

06:49.458 --> 06:51.000
imprinted His image
on the Shroud.

06:52.458 --> 06:55.000
The Shroud is a photograph
of the resurrection.

06:56.375 --> 06:57.083
Hmm.

06:58.541 --> 07:00.041
Didn't you say
you wanted to show me something?

07:00.208 --> 07:01.166
I do.

07:01.333 --> 07:02.125
Something very special.

07:02.291 --> 07:03.375
Just this way.

07:05.458 --> 07:06.833
See, I believe that
art tells

07:07.000 --> 07:09.750
the story of our past
and hints at our future.

07:15.041 --> 07:16.791
It's on loan for the exhibit.

07:16.958 --> 07:18.416
He's here to protect the Shroud.

07:20.375 --> 07:22.708
Saint Michael defeating
the devil.

07:23.625 --> 07:26.458
The war of angels
was the first war

07:26.625 --> 07:28.875
and the first evil.

07:29.041 --> 07:30.958
Thankfully,
Michael defeated Lucifer

07:31.125 --> 07:32.291
and bound him in hell.

07:33.875 --> 07:35.541
But the struggle
of good versus evil

07:35.708 --> 07:36.875
continues on
within each of us.

07:37.041 --> 07:38.458
Exactly.

07:38.625 --> 07:42.583
Evil is not some external,
mystical force.

07:44.625 --> 07:45.541
It's personal.

07:46.583 --> 07:48.291
I disagree.

07:48.458 --> 07:49.833
It's much more than that.

07:51.083 --> 07:53.125
This artist insisted that
the devil himself

07:53.291 --> 07:54.500
sat for his portrait.

07:55.833 --> 07:57.250
I think he may be right.

07:59.916 --> 08:02.625
I know of many good people
who have endured

08:02.791 --> 08:03.791
horrendous evil.

08:04.916 --> 08:05.958
Other-worldly evil.

08:06.125 --> 08:08.583
Yeah, so do I.

08:08.750 --> 08:12.958
But when something happens
to someone we deeply love,

08:13.125 --> 08:15.500
blaming it on the devil
doesn't fix anything.

08:15.666 --> 08:17.833
It certainly doesn't
reduce the pain.

08:19.458 --> 08:20.875
It's the only way
I can make sense of it.

08:22.541 --> 08:25.000
The war in heaven
has come to Earth.

08:25.166 --> 08:26.375
The devil never rests.

08:34.833 --> 08:36.458
Lucifer would have
consumed us all

08:36.625 --> 08:38.416
if Michael hadn't stopped him.

08:43.041 --> 08:46.250
Many prophecies
of the devil returning to Earth

08:46.416 --> 08:48.083
as a false god.

08:50.708 --> 08:52.250
I pray he never
finds his way out.

08:54.416 --> 08:57.375
But I must
find my way out.

08:59.125 --> 09:01.458
May I leave you three alone
to get acquainted?

09:01.625 --> 09:02.750
Sure.

09:02.916 --> 09:04.125
Thank you, Father.

09:04.291 --> 09:04.916
Enjoy.

09:36.666 --> 09:38.333
Laura.

09:46.166 --> 09:47.708
Father?

10:14.083 --> 10:15.375
Just in time.

10:17.208 --> 10:19.791
Several fires
have nearly consumed

10:19.958 --> 10:21.791
the Shroud.

10:21.958 --> 10:24.291
The last all but destroyed
this Cathedral.

10:24.458 --> 10:25.708
God saved it.

10:26.875 --> 10:27.916
Follow me, please.

10:28.083 --> 10:29.958
We will go upstairs.

10:38.375 --> 10:39.708
GUARD 2 [ON WALKIE-TALKIE]:

10:43.291 --> 10:47.250
GUARD 2 [ON WALKIE-TALKIE]:

10:57.875 --> 10:59.208
Goodbye. Thank you.

11:00.666 --> 11:02.000
- Ciao.
- Ciao.

12:43.333 --> 12:44.208
Go!

12:45.250 --> 12:46.041
Shoo!

12:48.208 --> 12:49.083
- Go!

12:51.041 --> 12:51.958
Go!

12:53.833 --> 12:54.500
Go!

12:56.250 --> 12:56.791
Go!

13:13.625 --> 13:14.708
Oh my God.

13:26.125 --> 13:26.958
Uh, no, no.

13:30.958 --> 13:33.708
Ah, badge, yes.

13:33.875 --> 13:35.916
GUARD 2 [ON WALKIE-TALKIE]:

13:39.041 --> 13:39.666
GUARD 2 [ON WALKIE-TALKIE]:

15:57.500 --> 15:58.375
Stop.

15:58.541 --> 16:00.333
Stop this at once.

16:05.208 --> 16:06.583
Stop this desecration.

16:07.666 --> 16:09.208
Holy Michael.

16:09.375 --> 16:11.041
Be our defense
against the devil.

16:12.583 --> 16:13.375
Rebuke him!

16:14.666 --> 16:15.666
No!

16:19.041 --> 16:20.166
No.

16:24.250 --> 16:26.375
Keep Satan in hell
and all his evil spirits

16:26.541 --> 16:28.458
who desire the ruin of souls.

16:29.875 --> 16:32.333
Join us here on Earth, Lucifer!

16:32.500 --> 16:35.041
Saint Michael,
return to us I pray.

17:15.958 --> 17:17.208
Take it.

17:39.541 --> 17:40.500
Stop.

17:40.666 --> 17:42.333
Don't kill her.

17:43.791 --> 17:46.041
He might choose her.

17:46.208 --> 17:46.958
No.

17:47.125 --> 17:48.291
No, don't touch me.

17:50.166 --> 17:51.250
Where are you taking me?

17:51.416 --> 17:52.958
No, please.

18:00.125 --> 18:01.125
Saint Michael...

18:02.625 --> 18:04.583
...take my body.

18:04.750 --> 18:07.750
Use it to defeat
this beast of Satan.

18:35.708 --> 18:36.625
Help me!

18:36.791 --> 18:38.500
Keep her quiet.

18:38.666 --> 18:40.125
Help!

18:40.291 --> 18:41.875
Who are you people?

18:43.041 --> 18:44.166
No.

18:45.583 --> 18:46.458
Michael.

18:46.625 --> 18:47.875
Kill him.

19:13.416 --> 19:14.541
Faster!

20:29.250 --> 20:30.625
Thank you all for coming.

20:34.208 --> 20:36.250
My name is Dr. Laurent.

20:37.958 --> 20:41.375
To resurrect brilliance,
my colleagues visited

20:41.541 --> 20:45.583
Santa Croce,
final resting place for

20:45.750 --> 20:50.291
Machiavelli, Galileo, Michelangelo.

20:52.458 --> 20:56.500
This Fort Knox of genetic
genius stores treasure

20:56.666 --> 20:58.500
much more valuable than gold.

20:59.333 --> 21:03.375
Brilliant DNA,
which until now

21:03.541 --> 21:05.250
was a puzzle that
could not be solved.

21:06.666 --> 21:14.666
Today, I alone can bring
these dry old bones to life.

21:15.750 --> 21:16.625
The result?

21:18.166 --> 21:21.958
Children you can
honestly be proud of.

21:25.958 --> 21:29.750
The past will become our future.

21:29.916 --> 21:34.750
Once I resurrect history's
most influential people

21:34.916 --> 21:38.875
from the dead,
I just need you to pay for it.

21:42.125 --> 21:46.500
Ladies and gentlemen,
the risen Antonio Vivaldi.

21:53.791 --> 21:55.333
And his proud parents.

21:56.958 --> 21:58.875
Congratulations.

21:59.041 --> 22:00.708
Thank you. Thank you so much.

22:02.875 --> 22:05.250
Next up for bid.

22:05.416 --> 22:09.250
One of the greatest poets
and architects.

22:09.416 --> 22:11.708
Considered to be
the greatest sculptor

22:11.875 --> 22:14.500
and draftsman,
living or dead.

22:14.666 --> 22:16.583
The creator of
the Sistine Chapel,

22:16.750 --> 22:18.875
the David,
Saint Peter's Basilica

22:19.041 --> 22:20.541
and the Pieta.

22:20.708 --> 22:26.041
Tonight, prize possession,
Michelangelo Buonarroti.

22:40.083 --> 22:43.958
So we start the bidding tonight
at e10 million.

22:45.083 --> 22:48.083
And there we have it,
just like that, 15 million.

22:48.250 --> 22:49.583
20 million.

22:49.750 --> 22:50.750
30 million.

22:50.916 --> 22:52.083
Any advance on 30?

22:52.250 --> 22:53.583
e40 million.

22:53.750 --> 22:54.750
70.

22:54.916 --> 22:57.458
e70 million.

22:57.625 --> 23:00.541
Any advance on
e70 million?

23:00.708 --> 23:01.458
80 million.

23:03.333 --> 23:06.291
80 million,
and 80 million going once.

23:06.458 --> 23:08.041
Going twice.

23:08.208 --> 23:09.708
90 million.

23:53.125 --> 23:54.041
Is the Shroud ready yet?

23:54.208 --> 23:55.458
- Yes.
- Good.

24:03.666 --> 24:07.500
Everything I have worked for
has been for this moment.

24:08.958 --> 24:10.916
Prepare the surrogates.

24:11.083 --> 24:13.250
He's waited long enough.

24:18.250 --> 24:22.000
Lucifer will finally have
a worthy home.

24:31.916 --> 24:34.375
Please make her stop.
Please, now.

24:34.541 --> 24:35.791
Make her stop.

24:37.500 --> 24:38.791
Hey, shhh. Hey.

24:38.958 --> 24:40.458
Hey, Sophia. Shut up.

24:43.958 --> 24:45.125
They're watching us.

24:46.208 --> 24:47.083
Where am I?

24:48.875 --> 24:49.708
Hell.

24:51.291 --> 24:52.833
What?

24:53.000 --> 24:56.291
Hey, where did they
get you from?

24:58.000 --> 25:00.458
Um, the Cathedral?

25:00.625 --> 25:01.291
Cathedral?

25:01.458 --> 25:03.000
You're a nun?

25:03.875 --> 25:04.791
Shut up.

25:05.750 --> 25:07.625
Shut up! Shut up!

25:10.666 --> 25:12.291
Can you make her stop, please?

25:12.458 --> 25:13.875
Hey, be quiet, be quiet.

25:14.041 --> 25:15.458
Listen, listen,
what's your name?

25:16.833 --> 25:17.958
Sophia. Sophia.

25:18.125 --> 25:18.916
She speaks English.

25:19.083 --> 25:20.458
Okay, okay. Okay.

25:20.625 --> 25:21.958
Sophia, Sophia.

25:22.125 --> 25:23.000
Hi, I'm Laura.

25:24.125 --> 25:24.916
Okay, Sophia, look at me.

25:25.083 --> 25:26.000
Look at me.

25:26.166 --> 25:27.458
You want to get out of here?

25:29.500 --> 25:31.875
- Yeah?
- Yes. Yes.

25:32.041 --> 25:33.458
Yeah, so do I.

25:34.625 --> 25:35.958
Okay.

25:36.125 --> 25:37.583
Okay, so what we're gonna do?

25:37.750 --> 25:38.333
What's your name?

25:38.500 --> 25:39.208
It's Brenda.

25:39.375 --> 25:40.833
- Brenda?
- Yeah.

25:41.000 --> 25:42.375
What's your name?

25:43.125 --> 25:45.000
- Alina.
- Alina.

25:45.166 --> 25:47.250
We're gonna have to stay calm

25:47.416 --> 25:48.750
and we're gonna
have to work together.

25:48.916 --> 25:50.250
All of us.

25:50.416 --> 25:50.875
Yes.

26:03.583 --> 26:05.208
No, no, no,
don't you come near me.

26:05.375 --> 26:06.541
Don't touch me!

26:06.708 --> 26:07.458
No!

26:09.333 --> 26:10.083
Get away.

26:18.500 --> 26:19.458
Off me.

26:41.250 --> 26:42.125
No, no.

26:42.291 --> 26:43.416
Bishop Bustamante is safe.

26:45.291 --> 26:46.041
They're on their way.

27:07.875 --> 27:09.416
Father Marconi.

27:10.958 --> 27:12.250
How could you?

27:13.416 --> 27:14.750
- My God.
- Oh.

27:14.916 --> 27:15.583
How could you
let them take it?

27:15.750 --> 27:16.958
Father Marconi.

27:17.125 --> 27:18.166
It's a miracle.

27:18.333 --> 27:19.125
Oh, you're bleeding.

27:19.291 --> 27:20.958
I'm calling an ambulance.

27:21.750 --> 27:22.666
Don't bother.

27:24.166 --> 27:26.000
Where were the protectors
of the Shroud?

27:26.166 --> 27:27.500
Sorry? Protectors of--

27:27.666 --> 27:29.458
Where were the protectors
of the Shroud?

27:31.875 --> 27:33.583
Ah, my head.

27:33.750 --> 27:37.333
Cardinal Vincini was
charged with its protection.

27:37.500 --> 27:40.916
But he became
to be unstable.

27:41.083 --> 27:42.458
Unstable?

27:42.625 --> 27:46.208
Prophecies of demonic beasts
and secret cults.

27:46.375 --> 27:47.750
What?

27:48.958 --> 27:51.250
Wild visions of the devil
coming to Earth

27:51.416 --> 27:54.083
and obvious dementia.

27:55.458 --> 27:56.625
Have you read the Bible?

27:57.666 --> 28:00.500
Pardon me? Yes.

28:03.000 --> 28:04.458
He's taking security footage.

28:04.625 --> 28:05.875
Where can I find
Cardinal Vincini?

28:06.041 --> 28:07.250
Father Marconi.

28:07.416 --> 28:08.000
As your superior,
I insist that you--

28:08.166 --> 28:09.250
My superior?

28:09.416 --> 28:11.125
Where is Vincini?

28:12.166 --> 28:13.416
Where?

28:16.125 --> 28:17.458
He is a hermit now.

28:17.625 --> 28:21.666
He's living alone
in Saint Michael's Asylum.

28:29.333 --> 28:30.291
Who is this girl?

28:34.375 --> 28:36.625
She-- she's a friend of--

28:38.833 --> 28:40.333
friend of yours.

28:40.500 --> 28:42.583
Laura is an arts student
from America.

28:45.333 --> 28:47.250
Well, listen to me.

28:47.416 --> 28:48.750
This is very important.

28:48.916 --> 28:50.291
Do not tell a soul
that I have been here.

28:50.458 --> 28:51.208
- Yes.
- No.

28:51.375 --> 28:52.541
Yes, of course not.

28:54.000 --> 28:56.958
By the way, who are you?

28:57.125 --> 28:58.125
Exactly.

28:59.416 --> 29:00.041
Now, there's something else.

29:00.208 --> 29:01.541
I need a car.

29:01.708 --> 29:03.041
You have a car.

29:04.625 --> 29:05.625
I have a car.

29:05.791 --> 29:06.583
Wait.

29:06.750 --> 29:08.166
What about the police?

29:08.333 --> 29:10.166
They would want
the missing footage.

29:10.333 --> 29:13.291
Tell them a priest stole it
after a demonic woman killed him

29:13.458 --> 29:15.083
and he came back to life.

29:16.041 --> 29:17.250
Or make something up.

29:18.500 --> 29:19.708
You don't want to get
sent to Saint Michael's Asylum

29:19.875 --> 29:21.375
for telling the truth now,
do you?

29:24.250 --> 29:24.833
Do you mind?

29:25.000 --> 29:26.041
No, please.

29:47.208 --> 29:48.125
Priests.

I come in peace.

32:54.541 --> 32:55.666
You from Turin?

32:57.333 --> 32:59.125
Did Bustamante send you?

33:00.625 --> 33:02.708
Come to make your confession?

33:02.875 --> 33:04.125
Excuse me?

33:04.458 --> 33:07.208
For the sin of
not protecting the innocent.

33:08.666 --> 33:12.166
For your indifference
to the sufferings of

33:12.333 --> 33:14.000
the children of God.

33:15.500 --> 33:17.708
I warned you fools for years.

33:17.875 --> 33:20.375
But you all thought
I'd lost my mind.

33:20.541 --> 33:23.500
You still think this collar
gives you protection?

33:31.458 --> 33:33.208
You're no priest.

33:36.583 --> 33:37.708
Who are you?

33:39.500 --> 33:41.041
The hound of heaven.

33:43.208 --> 33:44.375
Michael.

33:46.125 --> 33:48.000
Why are you here?

33:48.166 --> 33:50.083
They stole the Shroud.

33:53.500 --> 33:55.541
I have the surveillance footage
from the Cathedral.

33:55.708 --> 33:57.375
Was it a woman?

33:57.541 --> 33:58.583
An old woman?

33:58.750 --> 34:00.416
Yes, it was.

34:02.625 --> 34:03.750
Where is she?

34:06.083 --> 34:08.458
This asylum was built
as a lookout.

34:10.083 --> 34:13.250
Over here. Look.
Come here.

34:14.583 --> 34:15.500
See.

34:17.166 --> 34:19.416
You remember where Lucifer fell?

34:20.875 --> 34:23.250
Look. See.

34:26.458 --> 34:31.375
Those who guard it
work for Lucifer's release.

34:31.541 --> 34:34.750
Don't call that devil
by his angelic name.

34:36.458 --> 34:37.625
He can't escape.

34:38.625 --> 34:39.958
I chained him there.

34:43.250 --> 34:44.916
Come with me.

34:45.083 --> 34:47.291
Scripture tells us the devil
will be shaken loose

34:47.458 --> 34:48.541
from his chains.

34:48.708 --> 34:50.083
The gate to hell
will be opened.

34:50.250 --> 34:52.375
And he and his demons
will come to Earth.

34:54.916 --> 34:57.208
Now is that time.

35:03.916 --> 35:08.125
Two ancient beasts
who are of both worlds

35:08.291 --> 35:10.166
have been charged
with his release.

35:11.625 --> 35:14.875
The woman, whom you've met.

35:18.000 --> 35:20.375
And the beast of the ground.

35:22.250 --> 35:23.875
The only beast that
Satan allowed to come to Earth

35:24.041 --> 35:25.000
before him.

35:26.916 --> 35:28.875
There is nothing he wants more
than to fight his way

35:29.041 --> 35:29.625
out of hell.

35:29.791 --> 35:30.958
I know that.

35:31.125 --> 35:32.833
I put him there.

35:33.000 --> 35:35.208
And only I can free him.

35:35.375 --> 35:37.083
You mean God?

35:43.083 --> 35:47.833
These scrolls are from
the occult that guards the gate.

35:49.750 --> 35:52.000
They believe their Lord,
like Jesus,

35:52.166 --> 35:54.750
would be born from innocence.

35:54.916 --> 35:58.541
For centuries, they offered him
children for him to possess.

35:59.791 --> 36:02.541
No! No!

36:02.708 --> 36:04.125
Their young bodies
were not strong enough

36:04.291 --> 36:05.375
to contain him.

36:05.541 --> 36:06.833
Their suffering
was unspeakable.

36:07.000 --> 36:08.458
And we did nothing.

36:08.625 --> 36:11.625
The devil can't control
his pride or his rage.

36:11.791 --> 36:14.583
Therefore, he cannot possess
a mortal body.

36:14.750 --> 36:15.458
He'd destroy it.

36:15.625 --> 36:16.666
Not any.

36:17.916 --> 36:22.875
There is one body
that has held an eternal.

36:23.250 --> 36:25.416
And now science
has given the devil

36:25.583 --> 36:27.208
his way out of hell.

36:27.375 --> 36:29.416
Not even my brother will dare
to inhabit such a body.

36:29.583 --> 36:31.333
Don't you see?

36:31.500 --> 36:33.291
It's why they stole the Shroud.

36:33.458 --> 36:34.500
They needed DNA.

36:34.666 --> 36:36.416
God would never allow it.

36:40.250 --> 36:42.291
Isn't that why He sent you?

36:46.083 --> 36:47.791
God didn't send me.

36:50.375 --> 36:52.750
Now get me to that stronghold.

36:52.916 --> 36:54.041
Keep watch.

36:54.208 --> 36:56.291
I'll see to his destruction.

37:04.791 --> 37:06.041
Sharpen it more.

37:11.125 --> 37:12.958
Find anything?

37:13.125 --> 37:14.458
I don't need anything.

37:14.625 --> 37:16.291
Why do you think they need us?

37:18.041 --> 37:19.041
Sex.

37:20.750 --> 37:22.750
It's always sex.

37:22.916 --> 37:24.166
And then they'll kill us.

37:25.333 --> 37:27.458
No, fear gets us killed.

37:28.291 --> 37:29.500
I know, okay?

37:29.666 --> 37:30.958
I've had to fight before
to stay alive.

37:32.000 --> 37:32.958
So find a weapon.

37:37.291 --> 37:39.125
Are you married?

37:42.958 --> 37:44.750
My husband and child
were murdered.

37:47.208 --> 37:48.625
I'm sorry.

37:48.791 --> 37:50.125
It's okay.

37:55.916 --> 37:57.333
We're gonna be fine, right?

37:58.375 --> 37:59.416
Yup.

37:59.583 --> 38:00.958
No.

38:05.916 --> 38:08.000
At the current exhibition
of the Shroud of Turin,

38:08.166 --> 38:10.083
already attracting
over 2 million visitors,

38:10.250 --> 38:11.750
was abruptly closed today.

38:11.916 --> 38:13.958
The spokesperson
for the Archdiocese of Turin

38:14.125 --> 38:15.833
provided no official comment.

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
Sources within the Vatican,
however, did indicate

38:18.166 --> 38:20.041
the shocking possibility
that the Shroud itself

38:20.208 --> 38:21.291
has gone missing.

38:52.458 --> 38:55.500
Oh, yes. Right.

39:27.166 --> 39:28.375
DNA's complete.

39:31.208 --> 39:32.708
The girl from the Cathedral.

39:32.875 --> 39:34.333
Yes.

39:34.500 --> 39:35.708
Blood type matches.

39:35.875 --> 39:37.125
Healthy.

39:37.291 --> 39:39.916
Even her natural cycle
is fortuitous.

39:40.083 --> 39:41.416
Prepare her as well.

39:42.833 --> 39:44.125
Hurry.

39:44.291 --> 39:46.500
I can sense the hound sniffing.

39:52.125 --> 39:53.291
Ready?

40:24.583 --> 40:25.333
Hey.

40:42.583 --> 40:43.458
No!

40:45.000 --> 40:46.208
No!

41:19.375 --> 41:20.875
No! No!

41:23.375 --> 41:25.208
Get your fucking hands off me!

41:49.125 --> 41:49.958
No.

41:51.166 --> 41:53.791
Calm yourself down.

41:53.958 --> 41:55.458
Who the hell are you?

41:56.333 --> 41:59.166
I'm the angel of the Lord.

41:59.333 --> 42:00.833
Call me, "Liz".

42:01.000 --> 42:02.750
What are you doing to me?

42:02.916 --> 42:04.833
We're implanting

42:05.000 --> 42:09.750
a fertilized egg
into your uterus.

42:12.041 --> 42:12.916
You sick fucking bitch!

42:16.458 --> 42:19.791
It's a very important baby.

42:19.958 --> 42:23.166
Please, please stop now.

42:23.333 --> 42:24.541
Please.

42:24.708 --> 42:28.208
When I first saw you
in the Cathedral,

42:29.166 --> 42:35.333
your sketch of my Lucifer
was so inspired.

42:38.250 --> 42:41.458
I have never seen him
captured like that.

42:44.375 --> 42:49.541
And it's why I believe
you might be the one.

43:03.958 --> 43:04.625
Is this where we part?

43:04.791 --> 43:05.791
It is.

43:09.958 --> 43:11.625
Following us since we left.

43:13.875 --> 43:16.333
To light the darkness,
some flares.

43:16.500 --> 43:17.791
You have the torch.

43:18.916 --> 43:21.041
Be watchful.

43:21.208 --> 43:23.500
The beast of the ground
dwells below.

43:25.166 --> 43:27.083
We have lost many
to his claws.

43:28.791 --> 43:29.958
This won't kill him.

43:31.208 --> 43:33.125
But it will slow him down.

43:39.458 --> 43:40.958
May God be with you.

43:44.125 --> 43:46.750
Is God with you?

43:47.916 --> 43:49.458
This is my responsibility.

43:50.875 --> 43:52.375
I'll ask for permission later.

44:42.541 --> 44:43.500
No.

44:54.750 --> 44:55.750
Help. No, please. Please.

44:55.916 --> 44:57.166
Help us!

44:58.791 --> 44:59.958
Please.

45:04.041 --> 45:05.041
Help me!

45:38.083 --> 45:39.041
What is it?

45:46.750 --> 45:49.708
Oh God. Oh God, oh.

46:03.625 --> 46:06.625
Brenda. Stop it!

46:06.791 --> 46:07.916
Stop!

46:25.875 --> 46:27.291
No!

46:34.333 --> 46:36.000
Help me!

46:36.166 --> 46:39.375
May the holy mother be found.

47:04.375 --> 47:06.625
No! I said, no!

47:06.791 --> 47:08.416
Open the door!

47:09.708 --> 47:10.458
Open the door!

47:10.625 --> 47:11.291
Open it!

47:19.458 --> 47:23.208
Someone help me!
No! No!

47:23.375 --> 47:24.708
Oh my God.

47:24.875 --> 47:26.458
What the fuck are you doing?

47:26.625 --> 47:27.875
Oh my God.

47:31.958 --> 47:32.708
What is it?

47:35.708 --> 47:38.666
No! No!

47:38.833 --> 47:40.583
No, let us out!

47:41.791 --> 47:44.583
Please, please, stop!

47:44.750 --> 47:46.541
- Stop!
- Stop!

47:46.708 --> 47:47.416
No!

47:48.916 --> 47:50.083
Let us out!

47:50.250 --> 47:51.750
- Stop!
- Stop!

47:54.375 --> 47:56.958
No!

48:47.375 --> 48:48.500
What is this?

48:48.666 --> 48:50.041
Did you hear that?

48:52.125 --> 48:53.375
What is it?

48:53.541 --> 48:55.125
What's that noise?

48:58.208 --> 48:59.666
What's there?

49:01.291 --> 49:03.125
What the fuck is that?

49:05.875 --> 49:07.416
Do you-- do you see anything?

49:15.458 --> 49:17.625
No! No!

49:24.958 --> 49:26.750
We're gonna die here.

49:29.833 --> 49:31.541
Ah, no!

49:33.833 --> 49:35.208
No!

49:49.916 --> 49:50.458
Brenda!

50:12.916 --> 50:15.500
Help me.

50:17.291 --> 50:18.708
Brenda.
Brenda.

50:32.416 --> 50:34.666
No. No!

52:16.083 --> 52:18.125
The chosen one!

52:49.208 --> 52:53.166
You've found favor
and will bring forth a son.

52:58.791 --> 53:00.833
What's in me?

53:01.000 --> 53:02.916
A new Jesus.

53:03.916 --> 53:04.541
What?

53:05.291 --> 53:07.500
A better Jesus.

54:46.583 --> 54:48.583
Put it down.

54:48.750 --> 54:49.875
Put it down! Put it down.

56:12.541 --> 56:13.291
Excuse me.

56:13.458 --> 56:14.250
What are you doing here?

56:14.416 --> 56:15.833
Nobody's allowed in--

56:16.000 --> 56:18.041
No, what have you done?
What have you done?

56:19.291 --> 56:21.083
Why did you take the Shroud?

56:21.250 --> 56:22.916
Who are you?

56:23.083 --> 56:24.250
Why?

56:25.958 --> 56:28.833
A new beginning.

56:36.375 --> 56:37.833
No. Don't take--

56:39.083 --> 56:40.750
No.

56:52.416 --> 56:53.208
That's him! There!

56:54.333 --> 56:55.166
You guys smell that?

56:57.458 --> 56:59.125
It smells like smoke
or something.

57:08.083 --> 57:09.750
Is that a fire?

57:09.916 --> 57:11.458
Oh, don't just stand there,
we need to get out of here.

57:19.791 --> 57:21.708
Father Marconi?

57:21.875 --> 57:23.666
Oh my God!

57:25.125 --> 57:27.666
I thought you died.

57:27.833 --> 57:29.208
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

57:29.375 --> 57:30.375
We need to get you out of here.

57:30.541 --> 57:31.708
Michael.

57:31.875 --> 57:35.375
Yes. Yes, come on, let's go.
Come on.

57:35.541 --> 57:36.291
What's the matter?

57:36.458 --> 57:38.125
- Brother.
- What?

57:39.500 --> 57:40.500
Come on,
let's get out of here.

57:40.666 --> 57:42.208
Something's not right.

57:42.375 --> 57:43.083
I can sense him.

57:43.250 --> 57:44.083
Father Marconi.

57:44.250 --> 57:46.166
I'm not Father Marconi.

57:48.458 --> 57:49.750
No, you're not.

57:51.750 --> 57:53.041
You're one of them.

57:58.500 --> 57:59.958
Laura.

58:00.125 --> 58:02.250
Laura! Laura!

58:09.000 --> 58:10.125
Get away from me!

58:24.500 --> 58:26.166
I'm not one of them.

58:30.500 --> 58:32.166
Who the hell are you then?

58:32.333 --> 58:34.208
Father Marconi is dead.

58:35.541 --> 58:39.916
I'm just borrowing him
for a bit.

58:40.083 --> 58:41.125
What?

58:47.583 --> 58:49.083
What did they do to you?

58:50.750 --> 58:52.500
I don't know how
you live in these things.

58:57.125 --> 58:58.208
What did they do?

59:02.750 --> 59:04.250
They did experiments on us.

59:06.291 --> 59:07.875
What type of experiments?

59:09.625 --> 59:10.791
They raped me.

59:12.958 --> 59:16.625
They uh-- they implanted me
with something.

59:16.791 --> 59:18.375
It was horrible.

59:18.541 --> 59:19.208
Are you pregnant?

59:19.375 --> 59:21.291
No! No!

59:21.458 --> 59:22.458
I don't know.

59:23.916 --> 59:25.083
It changes everything.

59:25.250 --> 59:26.750
Please, can we just
get out of here?

59:39.125 --> 59:41.250
Turn the damn alarm off.

59:42.958 --> 59:44.708
The Shroud is gone.

59:44.875 --> 59:46.208
Go and find it.

59:47.083 --> 59:48.333
Follow me.

59:48.500 --> 59:49.625
I know Michael is here.

59:50.291 --> 59:51.791
This way.

59:51.958 --> 59:52.958
Through here.

59:54.583 --> 59:55.708
No!

59:59.125 --> 1:00:00.791
Damn fool, you.

1:00:00.958 --> 1:00:03.125
Not a finger on her!

1:00:20.375 --> 1:00:21.291
What's wrong?

1:00:21.458 --> 1:00:22.083
My stomach.

1:00:24.125 --> 1:00:25.375
What is that?

1:00:27.458 --> 1:00:27.916
Shit.

1:00:28.083 --> 1:00:29.208
Let's go!

1:00:31.541 --> 1:00:32.708
Through here.

1:00:37.208 --> 1:00:38.916
Slip through here.
Come on!

1:00:39.083 --> 1:00:40.458
Come on.

1:00:47.291 --> 1:00:48.416
Get down!

1:00:50.583 --> 1:00:51.625
Come on!

1:00:53.500 --> 1:00:54.750
This way.

1:00:54.916 --> 1:00:56.000
It's just through here.

1:01:07.333 --> 1:01:10.125
Come on. It's okay.

1:01:12.708 --> 1:01:13.333
Ah!

1:01:13.500 --> 1:01:14.458
Are you okay?

1:01:14.625 --> 1:01:16.666
Yes, just stay there.

1:01:19.833 --> 1:01:21.583
What are you doing?

1:01:21.750 --> 1:01:23.333
Hurry.

1:01:23.500 --> 1:01:24.291
It's coming back.

1:01:27.833 --> 1:01:28.625
Come on.

1:01:28.791 --> 1:01:29.875
Stay down, stay down.

1:01:30.041 --> 1:01:31.458
Where'd he go?

1:01:33.208 --> 1:01:33.708
Where'd he go?

1:01:34.583 --> 1:01:35.125
Watch out!

1:01:52.750 --> 1:01:54.208
Ah!

1:02:04.375 --> 1:02:05.500
No.

1:02:06.750 --> 1:02:07.875
No!

1:02:16.333 --> 1:02:18.291
Stupid little girl.

1:02:18.458 --> 1:02:20.875
Get her back safely.

1:02:22.750 --> 1:02:24.791
If you hurt him,
I'll kill the baby.

1:02:24.958 --> 1:02:26.333
You wouldn't dare.

1:02:26.500 --> 1:02:29.083
I'll have my chance.

1:02:30.416 --> 1:02:31.833
Ow!

1:02:32.000 --> 1:02:34.125
Accept what is
happening to you, Laura.

1:02:34.291 --> 1:02:36.666
It would be much easier
this way.

1:02:36.833 --> 1:02:38.875
I killed your priest...

1:02:41.625 --> 1:02:44.083
...and I'm going to
kill the angel within it.

1:02:46.250 --> 1:02:48.166
Go, find the Shroud.

1:02:48.333 --> 1:02:50.250
Without it,
we only have her.

1:03:17.291 --> 1:03:19.625
Oh, you caused
quite a stir tonight.

1:03:21.625 --> 1:03:26.416
This can be your second chance
to live the life you lost.

1:03:26.583 --> 1:03:27.750
You sick bitch.

1:03:27.916 --> 1:03:29.708
You've no idea who I am!

1:03:29.875 --> 1:03:31.708
Calm down!

1:03:34.208 --> 1:03:37.958
This pregnancy
will be like no other.

1:03:38.125 --> 1:03:40.500
Prepare yourself.

1:03:41.375 --> 1:03:43.625
He can't wait to meet you.

1:04:13.458 --> 1:04:15.583
No visual of the Shroud. Over.

1:04:17.416 --> 1:04:18.250
DR. LAURENT
Keep searching.

1:04:34.791 --> 1:04:36.625
I'm coming to find you, brother.

1:05:18.125 --> 1:05:20.041
The fetus is healthy.

1:06:10.125 --> 1:06:12.583
No, no.

1:06:12.750 --> 1:06:14.250
Why?

1:06:21.250 --> 1:06:22.833
Where is my sword?

1:06:25.083 --> 1:06:27.875
Now it's your turn
to rot in hell.

1:06:30.041 --> 1:06:31.083
Mammon?

1:06:32.083 --> 1:06:33.625
Michael.

1:06:33.791 --> 1:06:35.750
You look pale
without your sword.

1:06:35.916 --> 1:06:37.166
Where is he?

1:06:37.333 --> 1:06:39.250
Up with the mortals.

1:06:40.416 --> 1:06:42.666
We'll join him soon.

1:06:42.833 --> 1:06:46.250
Then we'll close the gateway
between the two worlds.

1:06:46.416 --> 1:06:49.958
And you,
you'll be imprisoned here.

1:06:50.125 --> 1:06:51.208
And we'll rule the Earth.

1:06:51.375 --> 1:06:53.291
I chained him!

1:06:53.458 --> 1:06:55.791
God would never set him free.

1:07:00.875 --> 1:07:02.333
Foolish.

1:07:02.500 --> 1:07:05.083
To take a mortal body
down here.

1:07:07.833 --> 1:07:09.625
Now you're trapped in it.

1:07:09.791 --> 1:07:12.291
Chain him
with Lucifer's sword.

1:07:38.750 --> 1:07:40.458
Look at him.

1:07:43.333 --> 1:07:46.083
He's given you
what you have lost.

1:07:46.250 --> 1:07:49.666
This child will never replace
what I lost.

1:07:49.833 --> 1:07:51.666
He'll give you even more.

1:07:55.750 --> 1:07:57.333
Look.

1:08:00.083 --> 1:08:01.291
Mommy.

1:08:07.750 --> 1:08:08.833
Did he speak to you?

1:08:12.791 --> 1:08:14.166
What?

1:08:15.041 --> 1:08:15.833
In your dream.

1:08:16.000 --> 1:08:17.250
Did he say anything?

1:08:20.000 --> 1:08:20.791
Laura.

1:08:22.208 --> 1:08:24.958
I want to tell you a story.

1:08:27.416 --> 1:08:31.291
About a brave warrior
who stood up to

1:08:31.458 --> 1:08:33.250
a gloating tyrant.

1:08:34.500 --> 1:08:36.666
How long have I been asleep?

1:08:36.833 --> 1:08:39.375
The warrior and the tyrant
were equal.

1:08:40.625 --> 1:08:44.583
But the tyrant demanded
that the warrior bend his knee

1:08:44.750 --> 1:08:46.791
and be his slave.

1:08:50.833 --> 1:08:52.666
What's happening to me?

1:08:59.125 --> 1:09:02.916
Our warrior,
the brightest of all, refused.

1:09:05.625 --> 1:09:07.916
He fought to free us.

1:09:08.083 --> 1:09:11.833
He would be soon free
and fight for us again.

1:09:12.000 --> 1:09:14.291
I don't give a shit about
your story about

1:09:14.458 --> 1:09:16.083
this goddamn demon seed, okay?

1:09:16.250 --> 1:09:16.666
I--

1:09:19.000 --> 1:09:20.916
He suffered for you!

1:09:22.041 --> 1:09:25.291
And the least you can do is--

1:09:29.000 --> 1:09:30.166
Laura.

1:09:34.708 --> 1:09:40.291
He's perfecting your body,
so you carry

1:09:40.458 --> 1:09:42.333
and protect the child.

1:09:43.583 --> 1:09:46.208
I want him out of me.

1:09:49.125 --> 1:09:51.291
I know, Laura. I know.

1:09:51.458 --> 1:09:53.083
This is difficult.

1:09:53.250 --> 1:09:57.000
Yeah, you kidnapped me,
put this thing inside me

1:09:57.166 --> 1:09:59.000
and now hold me prisoner.

1:09:59.166 --> 1:10:01.916
Yeah, it's a bit difficult.

1:10:02.083 --> 1:10:06.666
Once the child is born,
you'll be free.

1:10:07.291 --> 1:10:08.833
I promise.

1:10:10.708 --> 1:10:13.916
But for now, I control you.

1:10:14.083 --> 1:10:16.666
And I demand respect.

1:10:42.666 --> 1:10:43.458
Doll!

1:10:48.041 --> 1:10:49.166
Say quick, angel or demon?

1:10:49.333 --> 1:10:50.875
Stay away from him, Doll.

1:11:00.416 --> 1:11:01.458
Who are you?

1:11:01.625 --> 1:11:03.333
How did you get here?

1:11:03.500 --> 1:11:05.083
We're the Stolen.

1:11:05.250 --> 1:11:06.875
They stole us for Lucifer.

1:11:08.333 --> 1:11:09.583
We just want to go home.

1:11:09.750 --> 1:11:12.166
We don't belong here.

1:11:13.500 --> 1:11:14.416
Do you want to join us?

1:11:14.583 --> 1:11:15.708
Take the pledge.

1:11:15.875 --> 1:11:16.958
If one gets free--

1:11:17.125 --> 1:11:18.291
- All go home.
- All go home.

1:11:18.458 --> 1:11:19.791
You're a fool to trust
any angel.

1:11:19.958 --> 1:11:21.125
Say it.

1:11:23.041 --> 1:11:26.791
If one gets free, all go home.

1:11:26.958 --> 1:11:28.416
What's your name, angel?

1:11:29.250 --> 1:11:30.875
Michael.

1:11:31.041 --> 1:11:32.083
The archangel.

1:11:32.958 --> 1:11:35.333
Show us. Soar to the heavens.

1:11:39.625 --> 1:11:41.416
Bring me my sword and I will.

1:11:42.625 --> 1:11:43.958
Sword?

1:11:44.125 --> 1:11:50.000
It's about this big,
silver, gold, sharp.

1:11:50.166 --> 1:11:52.125
Yeah, we know
what a sword looks like.

1:11:52.291 --> 1:11:53.708
If there was a sword, we'd know.

1:11:53.875 --> 1:11:55.208
We're scroungers,
that's how we survive.

1:11:55.375 --> 1:11:57.583
There is no sword to save you.

1:11:57.750 --> 1:11:59.500
Just use your power.

1:11:59.666 --> 1:12:00.625
You're the archangel,
aren't you?

1:12:01.958 --> 1:12:02.750
They're here!

1:12:08.041 --> 1:12:09.625
Run!

1:12:16.250 --> 1:12:18.458
Doll, they got Zar!

1:12:18.625 --> 1:12:19.458
Get off me!

1:12:19.625 --> 1:12:22.083
Leave them be!

1:12:22.250 --> 1:12:24.041
No!

1:13:31.041 --> 1:13:34.708
I will give your painful life meaning.

1:13:40.500 --> 1:13:43.250
Did you kill my husband?

1:13:46.500 --> 1:13:47.791
My child?

1:13:47.958 --> 1:13:49.041
No.

1:13:49.208 --> 1:13:51.708
I've given you a child to love.

1:13:51.875 --> 1:13:54.666
I hate what that murderer
did to you.

1:13:54.833 --> 1:13:57.250
He took everything from you.

1:13:57.416 --> 1:14:01.583
I fear some of the nurses here
might do the same.

1:14:01.750 --> 1:14:04.375
You should do something
about it.

1:14:05.958 --> 1:14:09.666
I hate her.

1:14:09.833 --> 1:14:11.791
Liz envies you.

1:14:11.958 --> 1:14:13.208
If you like,

1:14:14.166 --> 1:14:16.291
I'll let you kill her.

1:14:16.458 --> 1:14:18.875
If that pleases you, Laura.

1:14:21.541 --> 1:14:22.708
Very much.

1:14:56.208 --> 1:14:59.416
I cannot come to Earth
without you.

1:14:59.583 --> 1:15:01.708
Give yourself to me.

1:15:03.541 --> 1:15:06.375
As I have given myself to you.

1:15:34.250 --> 1:15:35.625
The child is a drain
on her health.

1:15:35.791 --> 1:15:37.083
We have to do something.

1:15:37.791 --> 1:15:40.000
Laura is not getting weaker.

1:15:40.166 --> 1:15:43.083
She is bonding with the child.

1:15:43.250 --> 1:15:45.666
I can feel
she's getting stronger.

1:16:23.083 --> 1:16:23.750
Hello.

1:16:59.791 --> 1:17:02.250
What are you doing to me?

1:17:04.125 --> 1:17:05.958
Oh my God.

1:17:10.333 --> 1:17:11.458
I have to kill you.

1:17:11.625 --> 1:17:12.958
Mother, no.

1:17:38.833 --> 1:17:41.833
Laura, stop this now.

1:17:48.041 --> 1:17:49.833
No!

1:17:59.291 --> 1:18:01.166
LUCIFER'S VOICE:
No!

1:18:08.000 --> 1:18:09.083
No!

1:18:09.250 --> 1:18:11.208
No!

1:18:32.791 --> 1:18:34.208
Where is she?

1:18:40.916 --> 1:18:42.416
Open the door!

1:18:46.000 --> 1:18:47.916
Laura!

1:18:56.625 --> 1:18:57.500
All gone.

1:18:57.666 --> 1:19:00.083
How dare you, bitch!

1:19:06.083 --> 1:19:08.625
Go, go, get Laurent.

1:19:13.041 --> 1:19:17.666
You have no idea
what suffering means,

1:19:18.250 --> 1:19:21.375
until you live
our eternal misery,

1:19:21.541 --> 1:19:24.041
living in the dark
and in the dirt.

1:19:24.208 --> 1:19:27.916
And you,
you want to kill our Christ!

1:19:28.083 --> 1:19:29.958
You are the monster.

1:19:32.625 --> 1:19:34.291
You will be gone soon.

1:19:35.666 --> 1:19:38.333
Lucifer will consume you.

1:19:38.500 --> 1:19:40.666
But don't fear.

1:19:40.833 --> 1:19:44.750
Full possession is a comfort.

1:19:44.916 --> 1:19:46.291
Like death.

1:19:48.666 --> 1:19:52.875
All your silly independence
will end.

1:20:29.208 --> 1:20:31.916
LUCIFER'S VOICE:
How do you like it?

1:20:41.875 --> 1:20:47.208
No more mistakes.

1:20:47.416 --> 1:20:49.875
Lucifer, forgive me.

1:21:04.583 --> 1:21:08.583
LUCIFER'S VOICE:
I'm weary of Laura's womb.

1:21:08.750 --> 1:21:13.666
Being stuck up inside
her stinking mess.

1:21:13.833 --> 1:21:17.458
I wish it could be
you inside of me.

1:21:18.958 --> 1:21:22.458
LUCIFER'S VOICE:
Ah, baby.

1:21:23.833 --> 1:21:27.458
You have always been beside me.

1:21:28.916 --> 1:21:32.333
We've always been
one and the same.

1:21:36.750 --> 1:21:38.916
LUCIFER'S VOICE:
The same?

1:21:39.083 --> 1:21:42.333
Ah!

1:21:48.875 --> 1:21:51.125
After the birth,
no one can live

1:21:51.291 --> 1:21:53.041
who knows what happened here.

1:21:53.208 --> 1:21:54.708
Of course.

1:21:54.875 --> 1:21:57.583
And we will close the hell hole
with explosives

1:21:57.750 --> 1:21:59.625
after your army ascends.

1:21:59.791 --> 1:22:01.500
LUCIFER'S VOICE:
Good.

1:22:01.666 --> 1:22:04.833
Hell shall come to Earth.

1:22:05.833 --> 1:22:07.000
Yes.

1:22:07.166 --> 1:22:09.208
LUCIFER'S VOICE:
There is something else.

1:22:09.375 --> 1:22:12.166
I thought Laura
would come to love me.

1:22:12.333 --> 1:22:15.291
How I loathe that fucking whore.

1:22:16.958 --> 1:22:19.291
Even worse,

1:22:20.583 --> 1:22:22.958
the child has come to love her.

1:22:24.416 --> 1:22:28.583
He is willful
and wants his mommy.

1:22:29.750 --> 1:22:31.541
I didn't expect this.

1:22:32.708 --> 1:22:34.000
Oh well,

1:22:35.291 --> 1:22:39.208
once I'm born,
kill her.

1:22:40.833 --> 1:22:42.916
That will be my pleasure.

1:22:45.708 --> 1:22:51.166
LUCIFER'S VOICE:
And you, do something to
stop this bitch from killing me.

1:23:06.875 --> 1:23:08.791
This could be me.

1:23:13.583 --> 1:23:14.750
Should have been me.

1:23:24.833 --> 1:23:27.208
Saint Michael,
protect us against

1:23:27.375 --> 1:23:29.583
the snares and wickedness
of the devil.

1:23:38.958 --> 1:23:42.166
I pray God sends you help
and reveals to you

1:23:42.333 --> 1:23:44.208
how to defeat this evil.

1:26:18.166 --> 1:26:21.208
Oh, you are miserable, brother.

1:26:30.333 --> 1:26:32.166
Why did God set you free?

1:26:33.625 --> 1:26:34.958
He fears me.

1:26:35.125 --> 1:26:36.583
He does not fear you.

1:26:36.750 --> 1:26:38.583
Which is why
you must lead my army

1:26:38.750 --> 1:26:39.916
against Him.

1:26:40.083 --> 1:26:42.958
Then, we will be free.

1:26:44.916 --> 1:26:45.833
No.

1:26:47.291 --> 1:26:50.416
The last thing you want
is for others to be free.

1:26:51.458 --> 1:26:52.166
You're a tyrant.

1:26:52.333 --> 1:26:53.875
You fool!

1:26:54.041 --> 1:26:58.000
My angels are coming
to end you.

1:26:58.166 --> 1:27:01.041
You are powerless
without your sword

1:27:01.208 --> 1:27:02.708
of the spirit.

1:27:05.083 --> 1:27:06.958
Thank you, Michael.

1:27:08.375 --> 1:27:09.625
For what?

1:27:09.791 --> 1:27:12.041
For failing.

1:27:12.208 --> 1:27:14.416
For this revenge.

1:27:14.583 --> 1:27:16.125
But most of all,...

1:27:18.750 --> 1:27:20.875
...for my new home.

1:27:22.083 --> 1:27:24.833
I will now control
the Earthly body of

1:27:25.000 --> 1:27:27.166
God's precious son.

1:27:27.333 --> 1:27:30.500
The ultimate "fuck you, Daddy".

1:27:50.208 --> 1:27:51.666
Of course.

1:27:53.833 --> 1:27:57.333
I've been blind, foolish.

1:27:58.416 --> 1:27:59.291
Forget him, Doll!

1:27:59.458 --> 1:28:01.041
He's our last hope.

1:28:01.208 --> 1:28:03.958
I forgot that there are those
more powerful than me.

1:28:05.583 --> 1:28:09.041
And every scheme of the devil
will be turned against him.

1:28:09.208 --> 1:28:10.583
He's just bait
for us to get caught.

1:28:10.750 --> 1:28:11.583
Come help us, Grunt!

1:28:11.750 --> 1:28:13.291
I need to get to Laura.

1:28:13.458 --> 1:28:14.958
Come on, quickly.

1:28:15.125 --> 1:28:16.041
They'll be coming for you.

1:28:16.208 --> 1:28:17.833
Bring me my sword.

1:28:18.000 --> 1:28:18.625
Quickly!

1:28:18.791 --> 1:28:19.750
Listen to me!

1:28:19.916 --> 1:28:21.333
I need my sword.

1:28:21.500 --> 1:28:23.791
And Grunt, I can set you free.

1:28:26.500 --> 1:28:29.208
No, come on Doll. Come on!

1:28:29.375 --> 1:28:30.541
Don't--

1:28:31.750 --> 1:28:32.750
Listen to me.

1:28:32.916 --> 1:28:34.041
Bring me my sword!

1:28:34.208 --> 1:28:34.916
Is there any other way?

1:28:35.083 --> 1:28:35.875
No!

1:28:36.041 --> 1:28:36.708
Come on!

1:28:36.875 --> 1:28:38.250
Grunt, come on.

1:28:38.416 --> 1:28:39.500
Come on.

1:28:41.166 --> 1:28:42.083
They're coming, they're coming!

1:28:42.250 --> 1:28:43.791
Michael, get out!

1:28:46.666 --> 1:28:47.125
Help!

1:28:47.291 --> 1:28:48.208
Help him!

1:28:48.375 --> 1:28:49.583
Help me, Doll!

1:28:49.750 --> 1:28:51.166
Hurry!

1:28:52.250 --> 1:28:53.541
Help me!

1:29:00.125 --> 1:29:01.833
I need my sword.

1:29:02.875 --> 1:29:04.708
Stop!

1:29:04.875 --> 1:29:07.458
Give me the sword
and I'll spare you.

1:29:07.625 --> 1:29:09.125
Can you get us home?

1:29:09.291 --> 1:29:10.625
Of course, I can.

1:29:10.791 --> 1:29:12.041
- What are you doing?
- Grunt.

1:29:12.208 --> 1:29:13.750
Bring it to me.
And I will free you.

1:29:13.916 --> 1:29:15.541
Don't listen to him.
He's a liar.

1:29:15.708 --> 1:29:16.458
Grunt, you have to trust me!

1:29:16.625 --> 1:29:17.750
No, no!

1:29:17.916 --> 1:29:18.666
Bring it to me!

1:29:18.833 --> 1:29:19.625
We don't know him, Doll.

1:29:19.791 --> 1:29:20.791
But this is different.

1:29:20.958 --> 1:29:22.333
We've been burned before.

1:29:22.500 --> 1:29:23.375
Please.

1:29:36.083 --> 1:29:38.166
I promise I'll return.

1:29:38.333 --> 1:29:39.250
If one gets free--

1:29:39.416 --> 1:29:41.083
All go home.

1:30:40.875 --> 1:30:43.166
Oh, what have they done to you?

1:30:45.041 --> 1:30:46.541
Laura.

1:30:46.708 --> 1:30:49.250
You've got to trust me,
this child is not evil.

1:30:55.416 --> 1:30:57.000
Laura.

1:30:57.166 --> 1:31:00.291
LUCIFER'S VOICE:
Laura isn't here right now.

1:31:01.250 --> 1:31:02.833
No!

1:31:03.000 --> 1:31:05.291
Laura, I know
you're still in there.

1:31:05.458 --> 1:31:06.875
I'm gonna get you out of here.

1:31:13.000 --> 1:31:13.916
Stop!

1:31:19.250 --> 1:31:20.166
Stop!

1:31:25.291 --> 1:31:26.166
Stay with me.

1:31:38.750 --> 1:31:40.166
Laura, listen to me.

1:31:40.333 --> 1:31:42.250
This child is
not what you think.

1:31:42.416 --> 1:31:43.416
He will defeat the devil.

1:32:03.625 --> 1:32:06.625
LUCIFER'S VOICE:
Brother...

1:32:06.791 --> 1:32:10.041
I have wonderful news.

1:32:13.166 --> 1:32:14.708
My water's broken.

1:32:39.708 --> 1:32:42.375
LUCIFER'S VOICE:
Worship me or I'll end you.

1:32:42.541 --> 1:32:43.333
Never!

1:32:52.166 --> 1:32:57.083
LUCIFER'S VOICE:
Loving me will be a moment
of clarity for you.

1:33:02.458 --> 1:33:08.041
Even those against me
will question their judgment.

1:33:09.375 --> 1:33:11.458
We can rule Earth and heaven.

1:33:12.250 --> 1:33:14.958
We just have to kill Dad.

1:33:16.166 --> 1:33:20.625
He just gave me a message
for you.

1:33:21.333 --> 1:33:23.166
LUCIFER'S VOICE:
Whisper it in my ear.

1:33:23.333 --> 1:33:25.333
You won't possess the baby.

1:33:26.083 --> 1:33:27.708
He will possess you.

1:33:32.041 --> 1:33:33.708
LUCIFER'S VOICE:
He will possess me?

1:33:43.666 --> 1:33:45.416
No!

1:33:45.583 --> 1:33:49.083
The child will not be
my undoing.

1:33:49.250 --> 1:33:51.333
Can't you sense it even now?

1:33:51.958 --> 1:33:54.458
This child is born
of eternal blood.

1:33:54.625 --> 1:33:56.208
LUCIFER'S VOICE:
Shut up!

1:33:56.375 --> 1:33:58.541
He is more powerful than you.

1:33:58.708 --> 1:34:01.333
Because good is more powerful
than evil!

1:34:01.500 --> 1:34:03.000
LUCIFER'S VOICE:
Motherfucker!

1:34:05.625 --> 1:34:07.666
Try to stop your contraction.

1:34:07.833 --> 1:34:09.958
You can't stop this baby
from being born.

1:34:10.125 --> 1:34:11.250
He wants to be born.

1:34:12.458 --> 1:34:14.291
To bind you like I bound you.

1:34:16.958 --> 1:34:19.375
You are not God's equal!

1:34:20.083 --> 1:34:22.916
You rule over the rebellion.
That is all.

1:34:23.083 --> 1:34:25.125
And in every age,
you are defeated.

1:34:31.666 --> 1:34:34.541
Laura! Open the door!

1:34:36.583 --> 1:34:37.458
No!

1:34:39.416 --> 1:34:40.375
LUCIFER'S VOICE:
Kill it!

1:34:40.541 --> 1:34:41.583
I will not!

1:34:41.750 --> 1:34:42.541
LUCIFER'S VOICE:
Listen to me!

1:34:42.708 --> 1:34:44.666
No more tricks, Laura.

1:34:44.833 --> 1:34:45.791
Get her to the altar.

1:34:45.958 --> 1:34:46.708
LUCIFER'S VOICE:
No.

1:34:46.875 --> 1:34:48.250
It's God who tricked us.

1:34:48.416 --> 1:34:50.083
No, no!

1:35:09.333 --> 1:35:12.916
Push. Keep pushing.

1:35:19.000 --> 1:35:20.000
Good.

1:35:27.125 --> 1:35:28.083
Yes, it's--

1:35:30.166 --> 1:35:32.875
Where are you taking my baby?

1:35:51.125 --> 1:35:52.583
No, no.

1:35:53.375 --> 1:35:54.833
No!

1:35:55.000 --> 1:35:56.916
No, no!

1:35:57.083 --> 1:35:58.041
No!

1:36:25.250 --> 1:36:30.166
Welcome our beautiful,
exalted prince.

1:36:31.041 --> 1:36:35.416
We're no longer
under the tyranny of God.

1:36:42.166 --> 1:36:44.125
Our lost eternal.

1:36:47.541 --> 1:36:48.541
Worship him.

1:37:01.708 --> 1:37:04.083
Lord Lucifer,...

1:37:06.291 --> 1:37:12.041
...I baptize you
not with water...

1:37:12.208 --> 1:37:13.875
...but with blood.

1:38:11.500 --> 1:38:12.750
Take them all!

1:39:24.166 --> 1:39:27.208
He found you
in your youth.

1:39:28.333 --> 1:39:30.458
I want to be a part of it.

1:39:30.625 --> 1:39:32.208
I know you do.

1:39:33.541 --> 1:39:36.333
But I have something
much more precious.

1:39:38.791 --> 1:39:40.583
You'll have a moment with him.

1:39:57.250 --> 1:39:58.708
Check inside.

1:39:58.875 --> 1:40:01.291
No one can live
to tell the story.

1:40:24.208 --> 1:40:26.166
Laura. Laura!

1:40:27.291 --> 1:40:28.208
Laura.

1:40:30.458 --> 1:40:31.416
- Laura!
- Michael!

1:40:31.583 --> 1:40:32.500
Come, come on!

1:40:34.416 --> 1:40:35.708
Come on, that's it.

1:40:35.875 --> 1:40:36.625
That's it.

1:40:36.791 --> 1:40:38.375
Come on, that's it.

1:40:38.541 --> 1:40:40.125
Where's my baby?

1:40:48.041 --> 1:40:49.083
Give me my baby.

1:40:50.750 --> 1:40:51.416
No!

1:40:52.583 --> 1:40:53.833
No, no!

1:40:55.333 --> 1:40:57.500
Michael, don't harm my Lucifer.

1:40:57.666 --> 1:40:59.750
The child is not Lucifer.

1:40:59.916 --> 1:41:02.041
He has his own destiny.

1:41:02.208 --> 1:41:04.125
Lucifer's lust for revenge
blinds him.

1:41:05.458 --> 1:41:08.125
He chose the only DNA
that can imprison him.

1:41:08.291 --> 1:41:10.583
Lucifer didn't choose Laura.

1:41:10.750 --> 1:41:12.000
God did.

1:41:12.166 --> 1:41:13.666
Come on!

1:41:13.833 --> 1:41:15.291
Find Cardinal Vincini.

1:41:15.458 --> 1:41:16.791
Where are you going?

1:41:16.958 --> 1:41:18.083
Home.

1:41:18.250 --> 1:41:19.666
But first I have
a promise to keep.

1:41:23.041 --> 1:41:24.250
You're too late!

1:41:24.625 --> 1:41:26.500
Hell is coming to Earth.

1:41:27.458 --> 1:41:28.208
Go now!

1:42:35.000 --> 1:42:36.333
Thank you, Marconi.

1:42:38.625 --> 1:42:40.416
But I miss my old self.

1:43:04.875 --> 1:43:06.458
The hound of heaven indeed.

1:43:24.666 --> 1:43:27.083
Maybe some of you may say,
that Father,

1:43:27.250 --> 1:43:30.125
how old fashioned you are
to speak about the devil

1:43:30.291 --> 1:43:32.458
in the 21st century.

1:43:32.625 --> 1:43:35.958
But look out.
The devil's present.

1:43:37.500 --> 1:43:38.416
The devil's here.

1:43:40.000 --> 1:43:42.416
Even in the 21st century.
