00:01.126 --> 00:02.877
Previously on Prison Break:

00:03.044 --> 00:04.170
This is Scylla.

00:04.421 --> 00:07.549
You're not even close
to getting out of here.

00:07.632 --> 00:08.967
-Dad?
-It's me.

00:09.050 --> 00:10.260
Lisa?

00:10.343 --> 00:11.428
I'm at gunpoint.

00:11.511 --> 00:13.138
It's Tancredi.
She says if you don't

00:13.221 --> 00:14.222
let Michael and the others

00:14.305 --> 00:16.266
leave with Scylla,
she'll kill me.

00:17.976 --> 00:19.144
Don't!

00:22.355 --> 00:23.189
I'm leaving.

00:23.273 --> 00:24.190
No, Mr. White!

00:27.027 --> 00:27.986
Turn around!

00:28.069 --> 00:29.738
Gentle now, sugar.

00:29.904 --> 00:32.615
That's Special Agent
Miriam Holtz to you, sugar.

00:32.991 --> 00:34.868
We have it!
They got it.

00:34.951 --> 00:36.786
I never thought
you'd make it this far.

00:36.870 --> 00:37.954
I was wrong.

00:38.079 --> 00:39.080
What now?

00:39.456 --> 00:40.915
This is all your transfer
paperwork.

00:41.082 --> 00:43.084
I need to get
to Dallow, ASAP.

00:45.170 --> 00:46.337
What happened
to Gretchen?

00:46.421 --> 00:48.006
She got away.

00:55.513 --> 00:56.473
Self.

00:59.934 --> 01:00.852
Self.

01:12.739 --> 01:13.740
He screwed us.

01:13.823 --> 01:15.033
Self can't do that.

01:15.116 --> 01:17.494
He's government.
He can do what he pleases.

01:26.252 --> 01:27.253
The vans are coming.

01:27.337 --> 01:28.213
They're just late.

01:28.296 --> 01:29.380
He ain't coming back!

01:29.464 --> 01:31.091
You don't know that, Linc!
They're coming!

01:31.382 --> 01:32.675
What do we do now?

01:34.469 --> 01:37.680
Call Homeland. See how much
they know about Self.

01:41.059 --> 01:42.060
Stanton.

01:42.143 --> 01:45.730
Herb, it was Scofield
and Burrows.

01:45.855 --> 01:47.398
Are you at the Senator's office?

01:47.482 --> 01:48.650
I think I'm shot!

01:49.150 --> 01:50.610
I'm shot!

01:50.735 --> 01:53.446
Miriam's, gone, okay?

01:53.530 --> 01:54.614
What's your position?

01:54.739 --> 01:55.824
You were right

01:55.907 --> 01:57.575
about this whole operation.

01:58.368 --> 02:01.496
No. Burrows, Burrows!

02:01.579 --> 02:03.164
Don? Don!

02:04.707 --> 02:06.584
No, no, no, no!

02:09.337 --> 02:11.047
I need to find Gretchen.

02:12.048 --> 02:13.716
You gonna help me?

02:13.967 --> 02:15.802
Or you gonna make me
shoot you in the face?

02:16.219 --> 02:17.887
Help.

02:20.098 --> 02:22.100
Department of Homeland Security.

02:22.183 --> 02:25.186
I'd like to talk
to Don Self's superior, please.

02:25.311 --> 02:26.938
One moment, please.

02:28.690 --> 02:29.691
We gave this guy

02:29.774 --> 02:31.025
something worth $100 million.

02:31.109 --> 02:33.319
Is he even with Homeland?
Did we see a badge?

02:33.403 --> 02:35.655
We were given guns
and flown out on a C-130.

02:35.738 --> 02:37.198
He didn't work for the DMV.

02:37.282 --> 02:38.491
That doesn't make him the law.

02:38.700 --> 02:39.701
No, it don't.

02:40.243 --> 02:42.745
What if Homeland was in on this
from the beginning?

02:42.829 --> 02:44.539
This is Herb Stanton.
Who's this?

02:47.584 --> 02:50.670
Hello? Hello?

02:50.753 --> 02:52.630
The way Self played this,
nah, nah, nah.

02:52.714 --> 02:54.048
He kept himself too insulated.

02:54.382 --> 02:55.675
That's why, that's why
he hesitated

02:55.800 --> 02:56.968
with official authorizations

02:57.051 --> 02:58.219
on behalf
of our mission.

02:58.303 --> 02:59.888
He kept saying it was because
he didn't want

02:59.971 --> 03:01.139
the Company to find out.
In actuality,

03:01.222 --> 03:02.765
it's because
he didn't want to get caught,

03:02.849 --> 03:03.892
the son of a bitch!

03:03.975 --> 03:05.101
He kept the circle tight.

03:05.727 --> 03:07.437
Left the rest of us
holding the bag.

03:07.812 --> 03:09.063
If Homeland knows

03:09.147 --> 03:12.901
where we're at, sooner or later
they're coming for us.

03:12.984 --> 03:15.195
Let them come-- we didn't do
anything wrong. We have deals.

03:15.278 --> 03:16.738
No, we have paper.
That's what Self left us.

03:16.821 --> 03:18.156
That's what we have.

03:18.239 --> 03:19.866
We gotta get
out of here.

03:19.949 --> 03:21.701
We can't leave.
Michael needs surgery.

03:23.369 --> 03:24.913
I'm not talking about running.

03:25.288 --> 03:27.457
I'm talking about surviving.

03:35.798 --> 03:40.553
What I want is to see
the Company burned to the ground

03:41.095 --> 03:42.680
and you in prison.

03:45.600 --> 03:49.103
We did this to you.
We did this to you.

03:58.613 --> 04:00.406
They're ready for you
downstairs, sir.

04:10.041 --> 04:13.795
Today marks a critical juncture
in our endeavor.

04:13.878 --> 04:16.506
Do we have a bead on Scylla yet?

04:17.465 --> 04:21.928
Our security, our future
stands at a great precipice.

04:22.011 --> 04:24.555
It's a yes-or-no question,
Jonathan.

04:25.890 --> 04:28.142
And we don't need a soliloquy.

04:30.228 --> 04:33.064
Howard, why don't you wait
in my office?

04:33.147 --> 04:35.692
No. I'm in here

04:35.775 --> 04:39.445
making sure this operation isn't
fumbled as well.

04:41.823 --> 04:44.909
Out... now.

04:44.993 --> 04:46.828
What's your plan, Jonathan?

04:48.746 --> 04:51.291
That's what we're all here for,
right?

04:51.916 --> 04:53.126
You tried to move Scylla

04:53.209 --> 04:55.503
over our better judgment,
and it backfired,

04:55.586 --> 04:57.297
so spill it.

05:21.362 --> 05:24.032
Any further questions?

05:26.284 --> 05:27.827
Very well.

05:27.910 --> 05:29.203
You have your assignments.

05:29.287 --> 05:34.000
Access your assets
and retrieve Scylla today.

05:48.264 --> 05:50.600
Yeah, well, a lot of people
that believed in me

05:50.683 --> 05:52.977
in the last few months,
Agent Self,

05:53.061 --> 05:55.271
not all of them
are alive today.

05:56.564 --> 05:57.982
I can't shake that line.

05:58.066 --> 06:00.276
"All that avails is flight."

06:27.053 --> 06:29.097
Come on.

06:42.193 --> 06:43.486
Here, take that.

06:45.154 --> 06:49.826
Sara's right.
We need to get you to a hospital now.

06:49.909 --> 06:53.454
We were so close to
the finish line, Linc.

06:53.538 --> 06:55.415
So close.

06:55.498 --> 06:56.791
Yeah, I know,
I know, I know.

06:56.874 --> 07:01.379
Listen, I, uh, I spoke
to LJ yesterday.

07:01.462 --> 07:04.924
Told him this was almost over.

07:06.050 --> 07:09.095
I'm keeping my word
to my son, Michael.

07:10.972 --> 07:12.640
I should have seen this coming.

07:12.723 --> 07:15.226
No, no, it's no one's fault.

07:15.309 --> 07:19.188
Self played
all of us.

07:19.272 --> 07:20.815
We gotta get out of here.

07:20.898 --> 07:23.401
This is our last option.

07:28.531 --> 07:29.824
Yeah.

07:46.591 --> 07:47.633
Check upstairs.

07:47.717 --> 07:49.385
Clear.

07:49.469 --> 07:52.221
It's clear.

07:52.305 --> 07:53.890
Got anything?
Clear.

07:56.225 --> 07:58.352
Now we know where we stand.

07:58.436 --> 08:00.271
Let's go.

08:05.276 --> 08:06.319
Hello.

08:06.402 --> 08:07.862
Michael Scofield.

08:07.945 --> 08:08.988
Yes.

08:09.071 --> 08:12.074
Herb Stanton,
Department of Homeland Security.

08:12.158 --> 08:13.868
We want to talk.

08:13.951 --> 08:15.870
Can you please come back
to the warehouse?

08:15.953 --> 08:19.665
All right, but first we're gonna
need some assurances.

08:19.749 --> 08:21.709
What kind of assurances?

08:21.792 --> 08:23.669
Look, we held up our end
of the deal,

08:23.753 --> 08:24.712
so we're gonna need you

08:24.795 --> 08:26.214
to honor the terms
of our agreements.

08:26.297 --> 08:28.424
Well, I'd have to take
another look at those terms,

08:28.508 --> 08:30.801
but I'm fairly certain it didn't
include stealing Scylla

08:30.885 --> 08:34.680
or killing two federal agents
in cold blood.

08:34.764 --> 08:36.682
What are you talking about?

08:36.766 --> 08:37.808
Here are the new terms

08:37.892 --> 08:39.727
I'm prepared to offer.

08:39.810 --> 08:42.063
Come back, turn yourselves in...

08:42.146 --> 08:44.232
Wait a minute!
Self set us up!

08:44.315 --> 08:45.816
Don't,

08:45.900 --> 08:48.236
and I'll hunt you down
like animals.

09:24.564 --> 09:26.440
Now a look at...

09:26.524 --> 09:27.775
We did what they said.

09:27.858 --> 09:30.570
I ain't going down on some
trumped-up murder charge.

09:30.653 --> 09:31.696
Self pinned

09:31.779 --> 09:33.322
two murders on us.

09:33.406 --> 09:34.532
What are you doing, Linc?

09:34.615 --> 09:35.783
If Homeland Security comes...

09:35.866 --> 09:37.034
Then we'll handle it.

09:37.118 --> 09:38.077
You know what?

09:38.160 --> 09:39.954
There's gotta be a point
where you draw the line.

09:40.037 --> 09:41.414
Now's the time to draw
that line.

09:41.497 --> 09:42.623
Lincoln, don't be stupid.

09:42.707 --> 09:44.041
You can't fight off
all of Homeland Securi...

09:44.125 --> 09:45.626
Stupid is listening
to the government.

09:45.710 --> 09:47.795
I ain't going back
to death row, doc.

09:47.878 --> 09:49.171
We can still
hold onto our deals.

09:49.255 --> 09:52.967
All we have to do is flush Self
out, prove he has Scylla.

09:53.050 --> 09:54.719
How are we gonna do that, huh?

09:54.802 --> 09:55.803
We have to devise
another strategy.

09:55.886 --> 09:57.179
We should start
devising a plan

09:57.263 --> 09:59.765
that can get us a hundred miles
across the Mexican border.

09:59.849 --> 10:00.933
That's what we should do.

10:01.017 --> 10:02.727
My cousin Petey can hook us up.

10:02.810 --> 10:04.228
We're not running.

10:05.062 --> 10:07.023
We can't.

10:07.106 --> 10:09.150
Negative on Scofield, Burrows and Mahone.

10:09.400 --> 10:11.986
TDZ think that Self
may be using a bakergrip

10:12.069 --> 10:13.779
to mask his
cell phone signal.

10:14.363 --> 10:15.990
Place a tactical team
around Homeland.

10:16.073 --> 10:18.618
If Self or any of those other
bastards show up,

10:18.701 --> 10:20.911
make damn well sure they don't
get near the building.

10:21.746 --> 10:23.122
I can't go back to living

10:23.205 --> 10:25.583
in and out of motels, constantly
looking over my shoulder.

10:27.585 --> 10:29.503
Nothing changes.
We take down the Company.

10:29.587 --> 10:32.173
We finish
what we started.

10:35.051 --> 10:36.761
Who are you calling?

10:37.011 --> 10:38.012
A doctor.

10:38.262 --> 10:39.597
Sara, not now.

10:42.308 --> 10:43.309
When?

10:43.392 --> 10:45.019
Whoa-whoa-whoa, listen.

10:45.102 --> 10:47.980
Cole Pfeiffer, an employee
of GATE,

10:48.064 --> 10:49.815
a downtown wellness
organization,

10:49.899 --> 10:52.777
and his yet-unidentified-
female accomplice

10:52.860 --> 10:54.862
both seen here in police
sketches...

10:55.780 --> 10:56.906
And them.

10:56.989 --> 10:58.949
Gretchen?

10:59.283 --> 11:00.868
Bagwell?

11:01.744 --> 11:03.245
Have our people at DOT

11:03.371 --> 11:07.875
monitor every traffic camera
from San Diego to the Bay Area.

11:11.587 --> 11:13.964
I can't believe you shot him.

11:15.257 --> 11:17.718
Knowing when to sever
a cancerous limb

11:17.802 --> 11:19.345
to preserve
the rest of the body...

11:19.428 --> 11:21.389
He was one of your most
trusted advisers and confida...

11:21.472 --> 11:22.807
When I brought you in,

11:24.016 --> 11:28.270
I told you that a cardholder
has certain responsibilities.

11:28.354 --> 11:29.480
If you can't

11:29.563 --> 11:32.233
handle what
we're doing here,

11:32.650 --> 11:34.652
it's time you let me know.

11:35.111 --> 11:38.155
CEO Gregory White who
was shot and killed in the standoff.

11:38.406 --> 11:41.367
Police are trying to determine
whether revenge or robbery

11:41.450 --> 11:42.660
was the motive.

11:43.077 --> 11:45.788
Cole Pfeiffer was a recent
addition...

11:45.871 --> 11:48.165
Maybe we weren't the only ones
left hanging, huh?

11:48.874 --> 11:50.793
If we're gonna
flush Self out,

11:50.876 --> 11:53.421
how do you think he intended
to unload Scylla?

11:54.755 --> 11:56.048
Gretchen.

11:56.340 --> 11:57.466
He's got to sell it.

12:00.636 --> 12:02.346
Tell me when I'm
getting warm.

12:03.514 --> 12:05.933
You hand-picked Michael
Scofield and the bunch,

12:06.100 --> 12:08.936
trucked them all out here
on Uncle Sam's dime,

12:09.061 --> 12:10.771
to do your bidding,
and now they're

12:10.896 --> 12:13.858
standing right in the crosshairs
for what you did.

12:15.151 --> 12:18.863
I gotta hand it to you Don,
if that ain't the Mona Lisa.

12:21.699 --> 12:24.994
I always said cops are
more crooked than criminals.

12:25.077 --> 12:26.787
Let me guess-- a little,
little slice of heaven,

12:26.871 --> 12:28.289
is that what it was for?

12:29.707 --> 12:30.916
Gambling debt?

12:32.001 --> 12:33.461
Maybe you're a...

12:33.586 --> 12:36.213
a geologist of the
rock candy variety?

12:37.089 --> 12:39.133
The information you got
from Gretchen's prints--

12:39.300 --> 12:41.051
you sure it's
the right address?

12:41.135 --> 12:42.261
Right as rain.
Good. Now,

12:42.344 --> 12:44.638
shut up or I'm
gonna shoot you.

12:44.847 --> 12:45.848
Understand me?

12:45.931 --> 12:46.849
Oh, I, I...

12:46.932 --> 12:47.808
-Shut your mouth.
-I ain't...

12:47.892 --> 12:48.893
-I know when
-Shut your mouth.

12:48.976 --> 12:50.478
-to shut my...
-Be quiet.

12:58.068 --> 13:00.821
How long does it take to find
a pay phone in this city?

13:00.905 --> 13:03.240
They'll be back.

13:03.324 --> 13:05.201
Okay.

13:06.869 --> 13:08.329
Same deal
as before.

13:08.412 --> 13:09.330
Yeah.

13:09.413 --> 13:10.414
No physical duress

13:10.498 --> 13:12.708
for the next eight hours.

13:14.710 --> 13:17.129
Here's the thing.

13:17.213 --> 13:18.214
You need help.

13:18.297 --> 13:19.673
And running
around trying

13:19.757 --> 13:24.011
to track down Self
isn't... safe.

13:25.721 --> 13:27.598
We could be in Mexico
in a few hours.

13:27.681 --> 13:29.266
There are doctors there
that I trust.

13:30.976 --> 13:32.853
And you've been
taking care of all of us.

13:32.937 --> 13:36.273
I think it's really okay
if we take care of you.

13:38.692 --> 13:40.778
Surgery or no surgery...

13:40.861 --> 13:42.696
I'm never gonna be able
to live with myself

13:42.780 --> 13:45.491
unless I find a way
to take these people down.

13:48.619 --> 13:50.579
It's that simple,

13:50.663 --> 13:52.790
and, uh... I get it.

13:52.873 --> 13:56.126
I'm not gonna demand that
you feel the same way.

14:02.925 --> 14:04.552
I'm telling you,
we can't trust anyone--

14:04.635 --> 14:05.553
government, law enforcement...

14:05.636 --> 14:06.720
Which is all
the more reason

14:06.804 --> 14:08.514
-we should consider getting out of here.
-No.

14:08.597 --> 14:10.015
We deal with this now.

14:10.099 --> 14:11.892
I want this guy as much as you
do, but we're scrambling here.

14:11.976 --> 14:13.519
I mean, I don't know how
long Self has been planning

14:13.602 --> 14:16.021
this thing and from the looks
of it, it's pretty air-tight.

14:46.343 --> 14:47.511
Gretchen.

14:47.595 --> 14:50.347
I hope you're calling me to tell
me where Scylla is, Lincoln.

14:50.431 --> 14:51.515
You don't know?

14:51.599 --> 14:52.683
I don't know.

14:52.766 --> 14:54.184
What's going on?

14:54.268 --> 14:56.770
Self double-crossed us
and he took Scylla.

14:56.854 --> 14:58.480
You know where he

14:58.564 --> 15:00.024
could be?

15:01.692 --> 15:03.611
If I'm Self, I'm looking
for a new buyer.

15:03.694 --> 15:05.362
A new buyer?

15:05.446 --> 15:06.447
You know what?

15:06.530 --> 15:07.531
If you're playing me,

15:07.615 --> 15:09.450
I'm gonna split you in half.

15:09.533 --> 15:10.576
Yeah.

15:10.659 --> 15:12.036
I want him just
as badly as you do.

15:12.119 --> 15:14.580
Where are you?
I'm coming to you.

15:14.663 --> 15:16.874
Grand Hope Park. One hour.

15:22.171 --> 15:23.130
What?

15:23.213 --> 15:24.506
Sis.

15:24.590 --> 15:26.383
It's...

15:26.467 --> 15:28.385
Emily. She's, um...

15:28.469 --> 15:30.179
been in an accident.

15:30.262 --> 15:33.599
I want you to tell whoever's
got that gun pointed at you

15:33.682 --> 15:36.393
to grow a set
and get on the phone.

15:37.937 --> 15:40.147
She wants to talk to you.

15:43.484 --> 15:44.985
What's up, Gretchen?

15:46.570 --> 15:48.113
Time to come home now.

15:55.871 --> 15:57.498
Are we really gonna
keep trusting that bitch?

15:57.581 --> 16:01.460
Gretchen and T-Bag were waiting
at GATE with machine guns, guys.

16:01.543 --> 16:02.503
You think they just

16:02.586 --> 16:03.671
wanted to
provide cover?

16:03.754 --> 16:05.005
This chick's a mercenary.

16:05.089 --> 16:07.174
She'll do whatever it takes
to get what she wants,

16:07.257 --> 16:09.134
and right now we just happen
to want the same thing.

16:09.218 --> 16:12.471
We are taking
precautions, but...

16:12.554 --> 16:13.722
one way or the other, Gretchen's

16:13.806 --> 16:16.100
gonna get us to Self,
and right now...

16:17.559 --> 16:18.435
...that is all that matters.

16:18.519 --> 16:19.561
We don't stand a chance.

16:19.645 --> 16:20.729
Our photos aren't plastered

16:20.813 --> 16:22.523
all over the TV.

16:22.606 --> 16:24.525
Homeland's keeping it in-house.

16:24.608 --> 16:26.110
We have a chance.

16:35.285 --> 16:37.287
Senator?

16:37.371 --> 16:39.039
Herb.

16:40.958 --> 16:43.252
We sponsored this
operation with the best

16:43.335 --> 16:47.965
of intentions, but the secretive
manner in which we've handled it

16:48.048 --> 16:51.552
I now fear is
working against us.

16:51.635 --> 16:52.636
How so?

16:52.720 --> 16:53.971
We're in the middle
of a manhunt,

16:54.054 --> 16:56.557
and it's just you
and a couple of agents

16:56.640 --> 16:58.559
out there trying to rein in

16:58.642 --> 17:00.310
these cons.
It's madness.

17:04.606 --> 17:07.026
What we initially
sponsored...

17:07.109 --> 17:08.944
didn't pan out.

17:09.028 --> 17:12.364
That doesn't mean that
the boat is taking on water.

17:12.448 --> 17:13.949
No one knows.

17:14.658 --> 17:16.285
That's the way

17:16.368 --> 17:18.120
it's going to stay.

17:20.622 --> 17:22.082
Come in!

17:23.709 --> 17:24.752
Good afternoon.

17:24.835 --> 17:27.212
Richard Sooter,
US Marshals Service.

17:27.296 --> 17:28.714
I've been sent

17:28.797 --> 17:30.424
at the request
of Deputy Director Esmar

17:30.507 --> 17:33.594
to get to the bottom of the
Scofield/Burrows Supermax story

17:33.677 --> 17:35.095
once and for all.

17:35.179 --> 17:37.681
I'm hoping you
gentlemen can help.

17:38.682 --> 17:40.267
Guys, if
there's a reason

17:40.350 --> 17:42.936
you're keeping secrets...
just fill me in here.

17:43.020 --> 17:44.104
I can help.

17:46.523 --> 17:47.524
How strong is your stomach?

17:47.608 --> 17:49.777
Very.

17:49.860 --> 17:53.614
Herb... Stanton.

17:53.697 --> 17:55.449
He's working

17:55.532 --> 17:57.576
with Donald Self.

17:57.659 --> 17:59.078
We got a record

17:59.161 --> 18:01.497
of all incoming
and outgoing calls

18:01.580 --> 18:03.457
from Homeland today.

18:03.540 --> 18:04.792
Stanton received a call

18:04.875 --> 18:07.544
lasting approximately
one minute

18:07.628 --> 18:10.464
that was connected
to no one.

18:10.547 --> 18:13.300
No one we could identify.

18:13.383 --> 18:14.384
Self's phone.

18:14.468 --> 18:16.470
D.O.T. has a positive
ID on Gretchen

18:16.553 --> 18:17.888
from a traffic cam.

18:17.971 --> 18:19.098
She's still in
Los Angeles.

18:19.181 --> 18:21.475
Chris is on the phone
from Johannesburg,

18:21.558 --> 18:22.810
looking for an update.

18:22.893 --> 18:24.228
I'll call back.

18:25.562 --> 18:29.066
Now, about this Mr. Stanton...

18:36.657 --> 18:39.243
Alex, how are you doing?

18:40.410 --> 18:41.912
No sign of Gretchen yet.

18:43.330 --> 18:44.623
Linc?

18:44.706 --> 18:47.334
No sign of Gretchen.

18:47.417 --> 18:49.628
Sucre?

18:49.711 --> 18:52.506
She ain't here yet, bro.

18:52.589 --> 18:54.550
Sara?

18:54.633 --> 18:56.593
All clear.

18:56.677 --> 19:00.180
All right, here we go.

19:18.323 --> 19:19.741
That's far enough.

19:19.825 --> 19:23.036
Ah... that's
far enough.

19:26.665 --> 19:28.709
I'm sorry, Rita.

19:28.792 --> 19:31.712
I promise everything
is going to be okay.

19:31.795 --> 19:33.422
Yeah, we're all
friends here,

19:33.505 --> 19:34.464
Rita.

19:34.548 --> 19:36.300
Don't worry
about a thing.

19:42.931 --> 19:45.225
You know, sending Feng after
me almost cost me my life,

19:45.309 --> 19:48.061
and it did cost me my plan,
which is why you're here,

19:48.145 --> 19:49.062
Gretchen.

19:49.146 --> 19:50.480
You're going to help
me find a new buyer

19:50.564 --> 19:52.357
for Scylla.

19:55.235 --> 19:59.615
You've been talking to Scofield
and the boys, huh?

19:59.698 --> 20:02.367
Yeah, how are they?

20:02.451 --> 20:03.493
Good and pissed.

20:03.577 --> 20:04.828
Yeah, where are they?

20:04.912 --> 20:07.247
Gee, Don, I don't know,
I'm not their mother.

20:07.331 --> 20:09.208
You're not their mother,

20:09.291 --> 20:11.210
but...

20:15.214 --> 20:16.548
She looks just like you.

20:16.632 --> 20:18.634
Doesn't she?

20:18.717 --> 20:21.970
She's... got those
big blue eyes.

20:26.183 --> 20:28.268
I'm supposed to meet them
in a half an hour.

20:28.352 --> 20:32.189
Get ready to phone
in a tip to Homeland.

20:32.272 --> 20:34.358
Where at?

20:34.441 --> 20:36.526
Where?

20:55.545 --> 20:57.047
To perform the operation,
Michael,

20:57.130 --> 20:58.882
that would require signatures
from about

20:59.049 --> 21:00.342
20 different
department heads.

21:00.509 --> 21:01.927
The only way
this is going to work

21:02.010 --> 21:04.137
is via freelancer--
off the books.

21:06.723 --> 21:07.849
I should be thanking you.

21:07.933 --> 21:09.268
Okay, because
of what you've done,

21:09.726 --> 21:11.311
lives are going
to be changed forever.

21:20.779 --> 21:22.739
Scofield,
you reconsider my offer?

21:22.823 --> 21:25.158
If I get you Self
and if I can get you Scylla,

21:25.242 --> 21:27.452
are you going to be able
to hold up our deals?

21:28.912 --> 21:30.872
How do you intend doing that?

21:32.624 --> 21:34.710
Well, that's what we're
working on.

21:42.676 --> 21:44.136
The feds-- they're here.

21:44.511 --> 21:45.929
We were set up.

22:16.710 --> 22:18.795
Hands where I can see them!
Right now! Right now!

22:18.879 --> 22:19.880
Turn him around!

22:19.963 --> 22:21.089
Hands behind
your back!

22:21.173 --> 22:22.758
-Got him?
-Yeah.

22:22.924 --> 22:24.718
Right now.

22:35.437 --> 22:37.397
Killing two federal agents
ought to put you back

22:37.481 --> 22:39.608
on top of Death Row,
Mr. Burrows.

22:43.153 --> 22:44.446
We didn't kill anyone.

22:45.238 --> 22:46.281
Self's behind this.

22:46.990 --> 22:48.408
Don Self

22:48.492 --> 22:50.702
is a decorated agent
and an honorable man.

22:50.786 --> 22:51.787
Yeah.

22:52.287 --> 22:54.664
You wouldn't be the first guy
to sit in that chair

22:54.748 --> 22:56.666
and try to sell me
a bill of goods.

22:56.750 --> 22:58.627
Why weren't we halfway to Mexico

22:58.710 --> 23:00.128
by the time
you worked things out?

23:00.212 --> 23:01.463
-You slipped up.
-No.

23:01.546 --> 23:03.548
Because we were in the dark
just as much as you were.

23:03.632 --> 23:04.841
We know what
happened, Burrows.

23:04.925 --> 23:06.510
You're not
putting this together.

23:06.593 --> 23:08.261
Think about how much
Scylla's worth.

23:08.345 --> 23:09.346
Think of
the lengths that

23:09.429 --> 23:10.806
Self went to
to keep this thing...

23:10.889 --> 23:12.891
to keep this thing
off the books.

23:12.974 --> 23:15.394
And us? Us, of all people,

23:15.477 --> 23:17.437
pulling this job off.

23:17.521 --> 23:18.730
Where are the bodies?

23:18.814 --> 23:21.024
For five minutes,
stop thinking about us,

23:21.149 --> 23:22.567
and focus on Self!

23:23.360 --> 23:25.529
Why would we jeopardize
our freedom?

23:26.029 --> 23:28.657
It's the only thing
we've ever cared about!

23:38.083 --> 23:39.209
Where's Fernando?

23:39.292 --> 23:40.502
He's on his way.
Michael, look,

23:40.585 --> 23:41.545
I still have a friend
in the Bureau

23:41.628 --> 23:42.963
we can reach out to.

23:43.046 --> 23:44.881
Maybe she can make some calls,
see where they're holding Linc.

23:44.965 --> 23:46.383
Who are you calling?

23:50.262 --> 23:51.304
It's Scofield.

23:51.388 --> 23:53.140
All right.
So answer it.

23:56.768 --> 23:59.062
I should have put a bullet in
your face when I had the chance.

23:59.146 --> 24:01.440
I'm not the one
who set you up, Michael.

24:01.523 --> 24:03.150
Yeah? Who did?

24:07.654 --> 24:10.490
You know, I meant
what I said before, Michael.

24:10.574 --> 24:12.242
I like your style. Okay?

24:12.325 --> 24:13.577
You're a smart guy.

24:13.660 --> 24:16.413
Unfortunately for you,
I'm just a little bit smarter.

24:16.496 --> 24:17.914
Yeah? We'll see about that.

24:17.998 --> 24:21.084
I heard Homeland made a surprise
visit to the plaza, huh?

24:21.168 --> 24:22.794
Look, I'm going to give you
some parting advice.

24:22.878 --> 24:24.588
Run.

24:24.671 --> 24:27.549
Okay, get your pals
and just start running.

24:27.632 --> 24:29.634
We gotta go.
Michael, we gotta go.

24:29.718 --> 24:31.136
I appreciate all your help,
all right?

24:31.219 --> 24:32.512
I'm going to sell Scylla now.

24:32.596 --> 24:35.891
Don, you're not going anywhere.

24:35.974 --> 24:37.476
Really? Okay.

24:37.559 --> 24:38.518
Who's the buyer?

24:38.602 --> 24:40.061
His name is Vikan.

24:40.145 --> 24:41.480
And he's not a buyer.
He's a conduit.

24:41.563 --> 24:42.981
A conduit to what?

24:43.064 --> 24:44.774
We're not exactly
moving heroin here.

24:44.858 --> 24:46.735
It's a little bit
more specialized.

24:46.818 --> 24:48.111
There's about five
people in the world

24:48.195 --> 24:50.697
who know what do with Scylla
and are willing to pay for it.

24:50.780 --> 24:52.574
All right. Let's go.

24:52.657 --> 24:55.660
Bagwell's staying here.

24:56.661 --> 24:58.955
You will remain captive
in my negativity

24:59.039 --> 25:01.333
if you lay a hand
on either one of them.

25:01.416 --> 25:03.835
I warned you
not to screw me over.

25:09.007 --> 25:10.425
How could you?

25:10.509 --> 25:13.637
I'll be back very, very soon.

25:13.720 --> 25:17.724
And I promise you, that man
is not going to hurt you.

25:21.478 --> 25:24.523
How could you?

25:25.482 --> 25:27.567
I'm going to fix this.

25:28.860 --> 25:30.529
Wow, Gretchen,
you're making friends

25:30.612 --> 25:33.240
left and right, huh?

25:33.323 --> 25:35.158
Now move your ass.

25:42.332 --> 25:43.667
We've accessed Self's E.I.D.

25:43.750 --> 25:46.545
We've been able to get to files
he tried to delete.

25:46.628 --> 25:48.672
They're giving us
a lot clearer picture

25:48.755 --> 25:51.007
of who he is
and what he's been up to.

25:51.091 --> 25:53.176
Honorable, huh?

25:54.636 --> 25:57.055
What did you find out?

25:57.138 --> 25:59.516
A name. Robert Walker.

25:59.599 --> 26:02.394
The new identity
Self is planning on using.

26:02.477 --> 26:03.979
We found a Social
Security number,

26:04.062 --> 26:05.522
a bank account in the Caymans,
credit cards

26:05.605 --> 26:07.691
and a flight
itinerary

26:07.774 --> 26:10.235
out of the country
for tomorrow morning.

26:10.318 --> 26:11.861
So,

26:11.945 --> 26:16.116
first of all,
we owe you an apology.

26:16.199 --> 26:19.452
And, second, when we finally get
our hands on him,

26:19.536 --> 26:21.288
it's going to be
paramount to get your help.

26:21.371 --> 26:23.999
How?

26:24.082 --> 26:25.083
Your testimony,

26:25.166 --> 26:26.418
and the testimony
of your brother

26:26.501 --> 26:28.378
and the others
against Self

26:28.461 --> 26:32.215
in exchange for full immunity.
You walk away.

26:32.299 --> 26:33.925
We already had a deal.

26:34.009 --> 26:36.553
If you walk now, there'll be no one
left to tell the tale.

26:36.636 --> 26:38.930
DHS needs you
to cover its ass.

26:39.014 --> 26:42.225
We can't spend our time
chasing your friends.

26:42.309 --> 26:43.476
They need to come in

26:43.560 --> 26:45.395
so we can work
out the details.

26:45.478 --> 26:47.731
What if they don't?

26:47.814 --> 26:49.899
We got a whole bunch
of trust issues.

26:49.983 --> 26:52.944
Then, you'll all rot
in a Supermax prison.

26:53.028 --> 26:56.531
DHS is prepared to fly
into the face of this thing

26:56.615 --> 26:58.366
or to bury it.

26:58.450 --> 27:01.578
It's your choice,
Mr. Burrows.

27:03.371 --> 27:07.167
This is the best
you're gonna do.

27:13.798 --> 27:15.091
Michael.

27:15.175 --> 27:16.926
Linc, where are you?

27:17.010 --> 27:18.219
In the warehouse.

27:18.303 --> 27:19.471
Put me on speaker.

27:20.472 --> 27:23.266
Homeland knows Self screwed us.

27:23.350 --> 27:25.435
What do we have?

27:25.518 --> 27:27.270
They found a file
he thought he deleted

27:27.354 --> 27:28.355
with an international
bank account

27:28.438 --> 27:30.398
and a one-way ticket
out of here.

27:30.482 --> 27:31.983
So it's over.

27:32.067 --> 27:33.818
Yeah, well...

27:33.902 --> 27:38.198
if we testify against Self,
we get full immunity.

27:38.281 --> 27:39.240
Immunity from what?

27:39.324 --> 27:40.950
We... we did the job

27:41.034 --> 27:42.786
they hired us to do.

27:43.870 --> 27:45.830
Michael, Senator Conrad Dallow.

27:45.914 --> 27:47.957
We have evidence
that supports your claims.

27:48.041 --> 27:50.877
I'm giving you my word
your troubles are over now.

27:50.960 --> 27:54.589
Please, come in
so we can end this.

28:05.392 --> 28:08.103
Okay, um, I've decided...

28:08.186 --> 28:13.024
rather, I think that, uh,
we should hear the senator out.

28:13.108 --> 28:14.442
And, uh,

28:14.526 --> 28:16.111
if everything
goes south, then I do

28:16.194 --> 28:17.237
have a backup plan.

28:17.320 --> 28:18.530
Sucre, I want you
to go with Sara

28:18.613 --> 28:19.989
to the meeting place
and get a lookout.

28:20.073 --> 28:21.574
Alex and I are gonna make sure
they don't bring

28:21.658 --> 28:22.992
any surprises by doubling back

28:23.076 --> 28:23.910
to the warehouse

28:23.993 --> 28:27.747
and then following them
to the rendezvous.

28:27.831 --> 28:29.958
This is where we're meeting
the senator.

28:30.041 --> 28:31.251
All right?

28:31.334 --> 28:32.836
We'll be there.

28:42.262 --> 28:45.932
You know, my father spent
most of his political life...

28:46.015 --> 28:48.601
chasing justice.

28:50.270 --> 28:51.980
It was sort of
an obsession.

28:52.063 --> 28:55.275
And my mother and I
could never understand

28:55.358 --> 28:58.319
why he would
so easily

28:58.403 --> 29:02.323
make other people's
problems his own.

29:02.407 --> 29:05.160
And I think it's why
she left him.

29:07.162 --> 29:11.541
And, Michael, you remind me
more and more of him these days.

29:11.624 --> 29:14.836
The way you put
everybody else's problems

29:14.919 --> 29:17.547
before your own.

29:20.175 --> 29:23.553
That said...

29:23.636 --> 29:26.514
...I want you to know that,
if this meeting

29:26.598 --> 29:30.477
with Senator Dallow doesn't go
the way you want it to,

29:30.560 --> 29:34.063
you don't have to worry
about you and I.

29:34.147 --> 29:36.983
Nothing's...

29:38.526 --> 29:41.070
...nothing's gonna come
between us.

29:41.154 --> 29:43.615
Yeah.

29:45.533 --> 29:49.704
And everything
is gonna be okay, right?

30:02.592 --> 30:05.345
You know, I've figured it out.

30:05.428 --> 30:08.306
DHS wined and dined you
in the beginning

30:08.389 --> 30:09.432
and promised you
the world,

30:09.516 --> 30:11.017
and then they
ultimately settled

30:11.100 --> 30:12.352
on a broom closet

30:12.435 --> 30:14.979
next to some schmuck
from the FAA.

30:15.063 --> 30:15.980
And you said nil.

30:16.064 --> 30:17.106
Wow.

30:17.190 --> 30:20.276
Gretchen, you have a real keen
sense of perception.

30:20.360 --> 30:21.402
It's amazing.

30:21.486 --> 30:23.404
And this all ends

30:23.488 --> 30:26.699
with a three-story hut
in Tahiti, right?

30:26.783 --> 30:30.328
Flat-screen TV, a couple
jet skis outside.

30:30.411 --> 30:32.455
But what you're
gonna find, Don,

30:32.539 --> 30:34.499
is that when
the rush is over

30:34.582 --> 30:36.793
and you're done patting yourself
on the back

30:36.876 --> 30:38.586
and there's no one left
to tell the story to,

30:38.670 --> 30:41.130
you'll be just as alone
as you are now.

30:41.214 --> 30:44.092
That's who Don Self is.

30:44.175 --> 30:45.301
Is that right?

30:45.385 --> 30:47.303
You tell me.

31:00.817 --> 31:01.818
Yeah.

31:01.901 --> 31:03.611
Take out your gun.

31:04.279 --> 31:05.655
What's going on?

31:05.738 --> 31:07.156
You want a cut or not, Bagwell?

31:07.240 --> 31:08.157
Take out your gun.

31:08.241 --> 31:09.617
Relax, Don.

31:10.243 --> 31:11.744
All right.

31:12.537 --> 31:15.164
Point it at her head.

31:15.248 --> 31:16.875
Don.

31:18.585 --> 31:19.502
Pull back the hammer.

31:19.586 --> 31:20.837
Don!

31:24.549 --> 31:26.676
Don.
I want my money.

31:26.759 --> 31:29.012
And I want to be on a plane
by the end of today.

31:29.095 --> 31:31.180
Otherwise, you and your
family are gonna find out

31:31.264 --> 31:32.223
who the real Don Self is,

31:32.307 --> 31:33.349
you understand me?
That's him.

31:33.433 --> 31:34.934
-Do you understand me?
-We're set.

31:37.312 --> 31:39.939
Okay, that's him.

31:42.942 --> 31:44.360
Please.

31:47.030 --> 31:48.865
I'll call you back.

32:10.136 --> 32:12.847
1714 East Seventh Street.

32:13.389 --> 32:14.515
This can't be right.

32:14.599 --> 32:16.351
You sure this is
what he wrote down?

32:16.434 --> 32:17.685
That's what it says.

32:18.144 --> 32:19.646
It's a parking lot.

32:19.729 --> 32:21.439
Why would Michael pick here?

32:22.982 --> 32:23.983
I thought you
and Michael

32:24.067 --> 32:25.193
were going
to the warehouse.

32:25.276 --> 32:26.444
Michael sent me ahead.

32:26.903 --> 32:28.363
What's going on? Where is he?

32:28.446 --> 32:30.615
He's safe-- Michael's safe.

32:31.574 --> 32:33.159
We're not gonna be
able to do this alone.

32:34.118 --> 32:35.662
He's doing what
he has to do,

32:35.745 --> 32:37.038
and we have to do our part.

32:37.121 --> 32:39.207
And right now, that's getting
on that bus

32:39.290 --> 32:40.583
and getting out
of the city.

32:43.002 --> 32:44.462
And we got to go now.

32:47.173 --> 32:49.592
He just wants you
both to be safe.

32:51.427 --> 32:52.804
We got to go,
we really got to go.

32:52.929 --> 32:54.347
Where is Michael?

33:07.777 --> 33:08.778
Mr. Scofield,

33:09.112 --> 33:10.446
Herb Stanton.

33:10.947 --> 33:12.657
This is Senator Conrad Dallow.

33:13.116 --> 33:14.617
On behalf of all Americans,
I want

33:14.701 --> 33:16.202
to thank you
for your service.

33:16.285 --> 33:18.371
Save it. I'm here to give
my testimony,

33:18.454 --> 33:21.165
and then I'm leaving
with my brother.

33:21.958 --> 33:23.543
Right over here.

33:30.341 --> 33:32.760
All right, gentlemen,
tell us what you know.

33:47.191 --> 33:48.985
Are we really leaving?

33:50.194 --> 33:51.279
You heard Mahone.

33:51.362 --> 33:52.739
This is what
Michael wants.

33:53.781 --> 33:55.199
Right.

33:56.075 --> 33:59.537
Okay, but if the deal
with Dallow is legit,

34:00.163 --> 34:02.707
there's no reason to run, right?

34:03.624 --> 34:05.209
Michael's just covering
the bases,

34:05.293 --> 34:07.378
making sure that we don't run
into trouble again.

34:07.587 --> 34:11.591
Yes, but if he's in trouble,
he's going to need our help.

34:13.176 --> 34:16.012
Well, maybe he thinks
there's nothing left for us to do.

34:27.356 --> 34:29.901
If we leave now,
we're leaving him behind.

34:44.707 --> 34:47.293
I didn't know Don Self
had it in him.

34:47.376 --> 34:49.504
Now that we know
he's behind this,

34:49.587 --> 34:51.756
our situation's
a lot worse.

34:54.008 --> 34:57.470
We're not talking
about our careers anymore.

34:57.553 --> 35:00.640
We're talking
about real jail time.

35:00.723 --> 35:02.642
We get 15 years
just for conducting

35:02.725 --> 35:06.896
an unauthorized operation
without Congressional approval.

35:06.979 --> 35:09.857
Or not.

35:11.275 --> 35:14.529
This doesn't have to be
about containment anymore.

35:16.823 --> 35:18.741
It could be about excision.

35:22.578 --> 35:25.581
You all right with that,
Senator?

35:32.380 --> 35:33.881
Then they all go.

35:36.634 --> 35:38.886
Where are the others?

35:38.970 --> 35:40.888
Mahone, Sucre,
Tancredi.

35:40.972 --> 35:42.140
They're not coming.

35:42.223 --> 35:46.102
Linc and I will testify,
but the others...

35:46.185 --> 35:47.895
Well, we all get immunity.

35:47.979 --> 35:49.021
Those are the terms.

35:49.105 --> 35:51.524
Our testimony alone
will put Self away.

35:51.607 --> 35:54.485
Gentleman, we can't have
the others running around

35:54.569 --> 35:57.363
while we're trying
to wrap this up.

35:57.446 --> 36:00.491
Can we call 'em?
Can we get 'em here?

36:00.575 --> 36:03.244
The deal was for all of you.
Those were the terms.

36:03.327 --> 36:05.538
Without everybody,
this is no deal.

36:05.621 --> 36:08.124
Listen, pal, you're gonna get
what you want, all right?

36:08.207 --> 36:10.585
Are you gonna call them or not?

36:10.668 --> 36:15.882
Hmm, there never was a deal,
was there, Senator?

36:19.677 --> 36:23.347
I wish I could give you a better
answer, Michael,

36:23.431 --> 36:28.060
but Don Self left
a lot of rough edges.

36:28.144 --> 36:30.229
We have to smooth
them out.

36:30.313 --> 36:33.774
You want to tell me
where they are?

36:33.858 --> 36:34.984
It ain't gonna happen.

36:38.821 --> 36:40.448
I can get you Self.

36:40.531 --> 36:42.033
I can still get you Scylla.

36:42.116 --> 36:45.494
Scylla? Oh, we're past Scylla.

36:45.578 --> 36:48.748
Between getting it back
and ending this now,

36:48.831 --> 36:50.249
the choice is simple.

36:51.459 --> 36:54.754
You wanted your Supermax answer,
you got it, Richard.

36:54.837 --> 36:56.255
Now time to go.

36:56.339 --> 36:58.716
Escort Mr. Sooter out.

37:07.975 --> 37:10.436
I'm gonna count to five.

37:10.519 --> 37:12.939
One,

37:13.022 --> 37:15.066
two,

37:15.149 --> 37:16.192
three...

37:32.208 --> 37:33.960
You've got an appointment
with the General.

37:51.769 --> 37:54.563
Here you go.

38:02.738 --> 38:05.157
Wait right here.

38:31.017 --> 38:33.019
Been a long time,
Gretchen.

38:33.102 --> 38:35.521
No longer working
for the General?

38:35.604 --> 38:37.106
Correct.

38:37.189 --> 38:39.191
Who's he?

38:39.275 --> 38:41.027
I'm the guy that's holding
Scylla.

38:41.110 --> 38:42.403
You interested?

38:42.486 --> 38:46.032
Well, the General
has offered a reward for anyone

38:46.115 --> 38:47.325
who can return Scylla

38:47.408 --> 38:50.619
along with the heads
of the transgressors.

38:53.289 --> 38:54.373
I appreciate you allowing me
the opportunity

38:54.457 --> 38:57.543
to kick the General
in the teeth.

38:57.626 --> 38:58.794
Can I see?

39:03.466 --> 39:05.051
Move it, Burrows.

39:05.134 --> 39:08.429
I said move! Move!

39:08.512 --> 39:11.265
This has been a long
time coming, fellas.

39:11.349 --> 39:14.018
You picked
the wrong fight.

39:14.101 --> 39:15.394
Let's see how
well you like

39:15.478 --> 39:17.897
the second trip to
the General's office.

39:17.980 --> 39:20.900
Let's go!

39:20.983 --> 39:23.319
All of you.

39:25.488 --> 39:27.323
Sooter, please,
I can give you cover.

39:27.406 --> 39:29.617
Save it! Save it,
Senator, save it.

39:29.700 --> 39:32.953
The General specifically
asked that I bring you in alive.

39:33.037 --> 39:35.748
Just move.

39:43.422 --> 39:45.466
You were going to kill us,
Senator.

39:45.549 --> 39:48.302
-Linc!
-It was Stanton who made that call.

39:48.386 --> 39:50.262
What was
extremely complicated

39:50.346 --> 39:53.474
30 seconds ago
is not so now.

39:53.557 --> 39:55.267
There were six
people who knew

39:55.351 --> 39:56.727
about this operation.
Two of them are still alive.

39:56.811 --> 39:58.854
One is now on the run--
and I'm the other.

39:58.938 --> 40:00.689
And I'm not saying a word.

40:00.773 --> 40:02.316
You're not getting off
that easy, Senator.

40:02.400 --> 40:04.735
You are going to help us.

40:07.696 --> 40:11.075
There is a folder
in that briefcase

40:11.158 --> 40:12.243
on the conference table.

40:12.326 --> 40:13.494
It contains

40:13.577 --> 40:15.955
the last remnants
of this operation.

40:16.038 --> 40:17.790
Once you dispose of it

40:17.873 --> 40:21.001
none of this ever existed.

40:21.085 --> 40:22.753
That's the
saving grace

40:22.837 --> 40:23.879
of a covert operation.

40:23.963 --> 40:25.673
If you want...

40:27.007 --> 40:30.219
...it never happened.

40:34.098 --> 40:35.307
I'm going to walk away now.

40:36.100 --> 40:37.435
Catch a flight.

40:38.310 --> 40:39.770
Maybe see my wife

40:40.146 --> 40:41.897
before she goes to bed.

40:43.983 --> 40:45.901
I only hope I don't catch
a bullet in the back

40:45.985 --> 40:47.153
on my way out.

40:49.530 --> 40:51.365
I'm really very sorry,
gentlemen.

40:54.326 --> 40:55.703
We tried.

40:59.540 --> 41:01.000
We tried.

41:01.709 --> 41:02.585
Let him go.

41:02.668 --> 41:03.502
Linc,

41:03.586 --> 41:04.462
let him go.

41:04.545 --> 41:05.671
Don't.

41:07.214 --> 41:08.757
Let him go.

41:15.931 --> 41:17.433
We running now?

41:17.516 --> 41:19.185
I will kill you myself

41:19.268 --> 41:21.770
the next time you do
something like that.

41:24.815 --> 41:25.983
Where's Mahone?

41:26.775 --> 41:28.527
He's gone.

41:42.416 --> 41:44.293
Well, we can do business...

41:44.376 --> 41:45.961
when you get the rest of Scylla.

41:46.629 --> 41:48.339
What are you talking about?

41:50.132 --> 41:52.009
It's incomplete.

41:52.176 --> 41:53.177
Incom...? Wha--

41:53.260 --> 41:54.178
Who is this clown?

41:54.303 --> 41:55.971
-Clown?
-Yeah, clown.

41:56.972 --> 41:59.683
There's a piece missing, slick.

42:00.017 --> 42:01.810
Look. Here.

42:31.924 --> 42:34.343
♪ ♪

42:47.648 --> 42:48.524
Hello, Don.

42:49.024 --> 42:51.819
I believe you have something
that belongs to me.

42:54.613 --> 42:56.115
Come and get it.
