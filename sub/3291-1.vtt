Narrator:
<i>The year 1453.</i>

00:18.019 --> 00:20.452
<i>From the lands</i>
<i>of Constantinople,</i>

00:20.454 --> 00:24.323
<i>a mighty force of Ottoman</i>
<i>Turks sweep across Romania,</i>

00:24.325 --> 00:29.094
<i>threatening the very heart</i>
<i>of Christendom.</i>

00:29.096 --> 00:32.765
<i>From the ashes of destruction</i>
<i>arose a young Romanian prince,</i>

00:32.767 --> 00:36.035
<i>a knight of the secret Order</i>
<i>of the Dragon.</i>

00:36.037 --> 00:40.572
<i>A direct descendant</i>
<i>of Abel himself,</i>

00:40.574 --> 00:44.276
<i>the prince was charged to vanquish</i>
<i>the Turks from his homeland.</i>

00:46.079 --> 00:48.213
<i>Before leaving for battle,</i>

00:48.215 --> 00:51.450
<i>he appointed his one true love to rule in his place</i>

00:51.452 --> 00:53.419
<i>until he returned.</i>

00:57.657 --> 00:59.625
<i>He ordered</i>
<i>his four best knights</i>

00:59.627 --> 01:01.693
<i>to guard her</i>
<i>with their lives.</i>

01:09.502 --> 01:12.571
<i>Some say he fought</i>
<i>with the power of God.</i>

01:12.573 --> 01:16.442
<i>Others say</i>
<i>the blood of the dragon.</i>

01:20.280 --> 01:22.081
<i>Those who dared</i>
<i>whisper his name</i>

01:22.083 --> 01:25.184
<i>would feel the fear</i>
<i>in their tongues.</i>

01:25.186 --> 01:26.552
<i>Dracula.</i>

01:47.273 --> 01:49.408
<i>Far from</i>
<i>the bloody battlefields,</i>

01:49.410 --> 01:52.144
<i>another war</i>
<i>was being fought at home.</i>

01:52.146 --> 01:56.115
<i>Taking advantage</i>
<i>of their master's absence,</i>

01:56.117 --> 01:58.283
<i>Dracula's own advisors plotted to overthrow the throne.</i>

02:03.323 --> 02:05.858
<i>Unhappy with</i>
<i>the prince's visionary ways,</i>

02:05.860 --> 02:09.428
<i>the traitors dared not</i>
<i>challenge Dracula directly.</i>

02:09.430 --> 02:13.398
<i>They found his gentle bride</i>
<i>to be a much easier target.</i>

02:13.400 --> 02:14.800
(Screams)

02:21.674 --> 02:23.709
<i>The battle was over,</i>

02:23.711 --> 02:25.878
<i>but the war</i>
<i>had just begun.</i>

02:29.582 --> 02:32.151
<i>(Thunder rumbling)</i>

02:40.760 --> 02:42.661
Elizabeth?

02:43.730 --> 02:45.497
<i>Elizabeth?</i>

02:49.202 --> 02:51.303
Elizabeth.

03:14.794 --> 03:16.495
<i>(Screaming, groaning)</i>

03:18.298 --> 03:21.600
I have killed for God,
this I swear:

03:21.602 --> 03:24.303
the hands that fought for him
will now be turned against him.

03:29.209 --> 03:31.210
(Screams)

03:32.879 --> 03:34.613
<i>(thunder rumbling)</i>

03:44.791 --> 03:49.261
I have blessed myself,
baptized in blood.

03:49.263 --> 03:51.430
Eternal life
begins after death.

03:51.432 --> 03:53.699
<i>Ours begins now.</i>

04:16.990 --> 04:19.391
<i>I have killed for God,</i>

04:19.392 --> 04:22.027
<i>this I swear:</i>

04:22.029 --> 04:26.431
<i>the hands that fought for him</i>
<i>will now be turned against him.</i>

04:26.433 --> 04:28.500
Narrator: <i>Some legends say Dracula was cursed</i>

04:28.502 --> 04:30.335
<i>with immortality</i>
<i>as punishment</i>

04:30.337 --> 04:32.537
<i>for his defiance,</i>

04:32.539 --> 04:34.640
<i>to live with his</i>
<i>tortured soul</i>

04:34.642 --> 04:36.742
<i>for eternity.</i>

04:49.589 --> 04:51.356
<i>(Crow cawing)</i>

05:04.537 --> 05:06.805
<i>(animal howling)</i>

05:06.807 --> 05:09.074
The carriage is too slow,
we must leave it.

05:09.076 --> 05:11.410
Keepers,
gather around.

05:14.580 --> 05:15.914
(Grunts)

05:25.391 --> 05:27.025
<i>(animal howls)</i>

05:27.027 --> 05:28.560
Man:
<i>Alina, you take Esme</i>

05:28.562 --> 05:30.429
and go on ahead to
the rendezvous point.

05:30.431 --> 05:32.331
We'll try to meet up
with you there.

05:32.333 --> 05:33.865
We will stay
and fight.

05:33.867 --> 05:37.569
You're light
and have the fastest horses.

05:37.571 --> 05:40.072
Find Leonardo,
he'll know what to do.

05:40.074 --> 05:41.640
Come with us.

05:41.642 --> 05:43.608
I'll stay here
with the other knights.

05:43.610 --> 05:45.744
We'll hold them off
as long as we can.

05:45.746 --> 05:46.945
Now go!

05:46.947 --> 05:48.980
<i>(Animal growls)</i>

05:59.592 --> 06:01.626
<i>(animal howling)</i>

06:06.632 --> 06:08.700
We should move into the forest.
We can lose them there.

06:08.702 --> 06:10.736
We need to stay on the road
if we're going to find Leonardo.

06:10.738 --> 06:12.938
But we'll never make it to him
if the creatures find us first.

06:12.940 --> 06:14.673
Come on.

06:14.675 --> 06:16.108
This way.

06:18.544 --> 06:21.380
- <i>(Creature growls)</i>
<i>- (horses neighing)</i>

06:22.815 --> 06:24.416
Steady now.

06:28.388 --> 06:30.689
Easy.

06:32.925 --> 06:34.426
(Creatures roaring)

06:37.597 --> 06:40.499
Come on, Esme.
Faster.

06:50.443 --> 06:52.911
Leonardo should have
been here by now.

06:57.817 --> 06:59.551
This is it.

07:01.087 --> 07:03.588
- Where is he?
- <i>(Leaves rustling)</i>

07:08.461 --> 07:10.729
- Something's not right.
- <i>(Thunder rumbling)</i>

07:12.799 --> 07:14.766
<i>I don't like the looks</i>
<i>of this place.</i>

07:14.768 --> 07:17.569
- <i>(Creature growls)</i>
<i>- What is that?</i>

07:19.906 --> 07:22.541
- <i>(Creature roars)</i>
<i>- (horses neighing)</i>

07:25.511 --> 07:27.479
<i>Esme!</i>

07:29.882 --> 07:32.184
You okay?
Esme?

07:32.186 --> 07:34.186
Talk to me.

07:35.221 --> 07:37.622
(Groans)

07:55.708 --> 07:58.643
Where is your God now,
Crusader?

08:10.189 --> 08:13.592
Dracula: <i>Wrath,
this man was one of the Keepers.</i>

08:13.594 --> 08:16.094
<i>The Lightbringer</i>
<i>isn't here.</i>

08:16.096 --> 08:17.662
<i>Find it.</i>

08:23.736 --> 08:25.804
The Lightbringer
couldn't get far.

08:25.806 --> 08:27.772
<i>Spread out.</i>

08:34.145 --> 08:36.881
Take the prisoners
back to the castle.

08:36.884 --> 08:39.618
The rest of you,
follow me.

08:39.620 --> 08:41.753
<i>(Whip cracks)</i>

09:19.859 --> 09:23.061
Look.
What is that?

09:34.674 --> 09:36.808
You're going to be okay.

09:36.810 --> 09:38.877
Can you sit up?

09:40.646 --> 09:41.980
Come.

09:41.982 --> 09:43.114
<i>(Stick cracks)</i>

09:43.116 --> 09:45.350
<i>Get up.</i>

09:45.352 --> 09:47.285
Get up.
Come on.

09:47.287 --> 09:48.753
Come,
come, come.

09:53.092 --> 09:55.260
<i>(Men laugh, yell)</i>

09:55.262 --> 09:56.795
Man:
<i>Who have we got here?</i>

09:56.797 --> 09:59.364
Looks like somebody
lost a pair of wenches.

09:59.366 --> 10:01.733
- Feisty ones at that.
- You're not the undead.

10:01.735 --> 10:03.702
- And you're not knights.
- You're just common thieves.

10:03.704 --> 10:05.870
I'd prefer to think of us
as extremely charming

10:05.872 --> 10:08.840
and witty thieves.

10:08.842 --> 10:11.743
Hmm. I see there's nothing
common about you, either.

10:17.617 --> 10:19.818
- Men: Ooh.
- <i>(Whistles)</i>

10:20.953 --> 10:23.121
Allow me
to introduce myself.

10:23.123 --> 10:25.924
I am the great Lucien Merel.

10:25.926 --> 10:27.993
Really, what's so great about you?

10:27.995 --> 10:31.730
Some would say my excruciatingly
handsome good looks.

10:31.732 --> 10:33.832
Are those people blind
or just drunk?

10:33.834 --> 10:36.234
- Ooh.
- (Chuckles)

10:36.236 --> 10:39.104
Look, darling,
we want what's in that box.

10:39.106 --> 10:40.839
So why don't you
just hand it over

10:40.841 --> 10:42.374
and we can all go on
our merry way?

10:42.376 --> 10:44.409
Over our dead bodies.

10:44.411 --> 10:47.078
You'd certainly make
a lovely pair of corpses.

10:47.080 --> 10:49.748
Move along
and no one gets hurt.

10:49.750 --> 10:51.416
(Laughs)

10:51.418 --> 10:54.052
(speaks native language) We have
got you completely surrounded.

10:54.054 --> 10:56.888
(Men laughing)

10:56.890 --> 10:58.857
What did you
do that for?

10:58.859 --> 11:01.726
- I warned you.
- Boys, take the box.

11:01.728 --> 11:05.397
That box is more important
than you could ever imagine.

11:05.399 --> 11:06.931
Man:
<i>Really?</i>

11:06.933 --> 11:10.301
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>
<i>I'm real scared.</i>

11:10.303 --> 11:12.671
(Groans)

11:14.707 --> 11:17.442
- <i>There you go.</i>
<i>- Whoo. Sorry.</i>

11:17.444 --> 11:19.878
Told you we were
witty thieves.

11:19.880 --> 11:22.347
We're delivering it to a man
named Leonardo Van Helsing.

11:22.349 --> 11:25.383
- Never heard of him.
- If you want money,

11:25.385 --> 11:28.053
he will pay handsomely
for your assistance.

11:28.055 --> 11:29.888
But if you choose
to steal what's his,

11:29.890 --> 11:31.690
he's a dangerous man.

11:31.692 --> 11:33.425
And so am I.

11:36.929 --> 11:39.064
- Sorry.
- Boys.

11:39.066 --> 11:41.933
See ya later,
wenches.

11:41.935 --> 11:43.768
- Wait!
- (Groans)

11:43.770 --> 11:45.437
Now what?

11:45.439 --> 11:50.341
Take us with you.
Just to the next village.

11:50.343 --> 11:53.178
- This is what I'm talking about.
- Dude, listen, don't do it.

11:53.180 --> 11:55.814
- This is what happened last time.
- Women are nothing but trouble.

11:55.816 --> 11:57.482
- What are you doing?
- Just go with it.

11:57.484 --> 12:00.085
- But she's beautiful.
- You can buy women

12:00.087 --> 12:01.986
which will be less of a headache
than those two up there.

12:01.988 --> 12:03.321
Are you insane?

12:03.323 --> 12:04.856
Just play along.

12:04.858 --> 12:07.258
- Sorry, boys.
- (Scoffs)

12:07.260 --> 12:09.360
We have
lost him again.

12:12.431 --> 12:14.232
So what would
we do with you?

12:14.234 --> 12:17.135
<i>(Coins clink)</i>

12:17.137 --> 12:19.471
Alina: <i>We can pay for safe passage.</i>

12:19.473 --> 12:22.474
And Esme
is a great cook.

12:22.476 --> 12:26.111
- I am?
- Yes, you are.

12:27.346 --> 12:31.049
Fine.
But you'll do as I say.

12:31.051 --> 12:33.351
- Understood?
- Yeah.

12:33.353 --> 12:35.420
- Until the next village.
- <i>(Thunder rumbling)</i>

12:49.301 --> 12:52.237
(growls)

12:58.244 --> 13:01.379
Girl: What's happening to us?
Where are we?

13:12.091 --> 13:14.058
<i>I'm so scared.</i>

13:21.834 --> 13:23.802
Welcome.

13:23.804 --> 13:25.970
You must be tired
after your journey.

13:25.972 --> 13:27.972
Let us go.

13:27.974 --> 13:30.909
Do not worry.
You'll not be harmed.

13:30.911 --> 13:34.012
I am Renfield.

13:34.014 --> 13:36.881
Chancellor of this kingdom.

13:36.883 --> 13:40.885
Come. I will see that
your needs are tended to.

13:43.823 --> 13:47.292
Girl #2: <i>Who's this? Who's this?</i>
<i>What does he want?</i>

14:23.462 --> 14:25.563
(Sniffs)

14:39.612 --> 14:41.346
Come.

14:41.348 --> 14:44.415
I will see that
your needs are tended to.

14:57.429 --> 14:59.564
Woman:
<i>(speaking native language)</i>

14:59.566 --> 15:03.434
All the comforts of our castle are open to you.

15:05.037 --> 15:07.338
Through here
is the great hall.

15:07.340 --> 15:09.374
Enjoy.

15:09.376 --> 15:13.378
<i>(Woman speaks</i>
<i>native language)</i>

15:13.380 --> 15:16.214
<i>(giggles)</i>

15:17.616 --> 15:20.184
Renfield:
All sorts of pleasures

15:20.186 --> 15:22.253
and adventures await you.

15:26.191 --> 15:28.126
(Speaking
native language)

15:29.161 --> 15:30.495
(speaking native language)

15:45.177 --> 15:47.512
This is the main
dining room.

15:49.014 --> 15:51.349
<i>You are our guests.</i>

15:51.351 --> 15:54.285
We want you to enjoy
your time with us.

15:54.287 --> 15:57.121
- It's beautiful.
- All of this is for you.

15:58.657 --> 16:01.626
<i>Whatever you want or desire,</i>
<i>it's here.</i>

16:01.628 --> 16:06.531
We want to make you feel
at home and welcome.

16:06.533 --> 16:10.068
Everything has been done for
your pleasure and enjoyment.

16:10.070 --> 16:12.737
The music...

16:12.739 --> 16:15.073
<i>company...</i>

16:15.075 --> 16:16.741
<i>comfort...</i>

16:16.743 --> 16:19.677
<i>all is for you.</i>

16:19.679 --> 16:21.980
<i>We hope that</i>
<i>you will learn to love us,</i>

16:21.982 --> 16:25.717
embrace your
new life with us.

16:25.719 --> 16:28.519
I will leave you now.

16:28.521 --> 16:31.689
The master will see you
again tomorrow.

16:31.691 --> 16:34.192
Sit, eat.

16:34.194 --> 16:35.727
Enjoy.

16:35.729 --> 16:37.729
This is your new home.

16:40.299 --> 16:42.133
(Chatter)

17:13.398 --> 17:15.366
The newcomers
have settled in.

17:16.769 --> 17:19.037
I don't like strangers.

17:19.039 --> 17:20.805
There is word of slayers

17:20.807 --> 17:23.808
arriving from as far away
as Kvenland,

17:23.810 --> 17:27.377
the frozen wastes
of the north.

17:27.380 --> 17:29.547
With so many enemies
aligned against us,

17:29.549 --> 17:31.616
we must increase
our numbers.

17:31.618 --> 17:33.785
Just think...

17:33.787 --> 17:36.354
with the Lightbringer
in your possession,

17:36.356 --> 17:39.323
<i>we will no longer have to worry</i>
<i>about these things again.</i>

17:39.325 --> 17:41.492
We'll find it.

17:43.462 --> 17:46.197
And then you can have as many followers as you wish.

17:46.199 --> 17:48.066
Just think, sire...

17:49.635 --> 17:51.836
once the Lightbringer
is in your possession,

17:51.838 --> 17:54.105
<i>no one need die again.</i>

17:54.107 --> 17:56.240
Except those who defy me.

17:59.645 --> 18:02.413
(Growls)

18:02.415 --> 18:04.415
<i>(thunder rumbling)</i>

18:06.418 --> 18:08.386
<i>(animal howling)</i>

18:49.461 --> 18:51.429
<i>(chatter)</i>

18:51.431 --> 18:53.498
I say
it's gold.

18:53.500 --> 18:57.335
- No, it's too light to be gold.
- Oh, what do you know?

18:57.337 --> 19:00.605
Lucien: Well, whatever it is,
they've spared no expense on the lock.

19:00.607 --> 19:02.874
This is a bad idea,
Alina.

19:02.876 --> 19:04.876
What other choice
did we have?

19:09.548 --> 19:11.482
Gather 'round, boys.
Moment of truth.

19:11.484 --> 19:14.185
- <i>Come on.</i>
<i>- Man: All right, open it up!</i>

19:16.221 --> 19:18.322
Come on,
a little enthusiasm.

19:18.324 --> 19:20.191
<i>(Cheering)</i>

19:20.193 --> 19:22.360
Open it already.

19:30.302 --> 19:32.737
- It's just a walking stick.
- Man: <i>(laughs)</i>

19:32.739 --> 19:34.272
<i>All that effort</i>
<i>for a piece of wood.</i>

19:34.274 --> 19:35.907
We cannot lose
the Lightbringer.

19:35.909 --> 19:38.442
Wait,
what did you say?

19:38.444 --> 19:40.478
The Lightbringer.

19:40.480 --> 19:41.746
It alone has
the power to defeat

19:41.748 --> 19:44.315
Dracula and the
creatures of the night.

19:44.317 --> 19:46.184
(Men laughing)

19:51.857 --> 19:53.758
Wait, so you're
saying you think

19:53.760 --> 19:56.694
this is some kind of
magic walking stick?

19:56.696 --> 20:00.198
It's what Cain used to slay Abel.
It was the very first weapon.

20:00.200 --> 20:02.400
Whoo!
You don't say.

20:02.402 --> 20:04.335
The blood of innocents

20:04.337 --> 20:07.605
transformed it into
a tool of God's vengeance.

20:07.607 --> 20:09.540
- Did you bang your head?
- I think so.

20:13.779 --> 20:15.680
The trail ends here.

20:20.919 --> 20:22.486
Spread out.

20:26.458 --> 20:28.459
In the right
person's hands,

20:28.461 --> 20:30.995
it has the power
to wipe out entire armies.

20:30.997 --> 20:33.297
You're putting a lot of faith into a walking stick,

20:33.299 --> 20:34.832
aren't you,
sweetheart?

20:34.834 --> 20:36.767
(Men ooh)

20:39.705 --> 20:41.239
(men ooh)

20:41.241 --> 20:44.642
Oh, what a strong one
here, boys.

20:47.946 --> 20:49.780
Trade you
for a kiss.

20:53.385 --> 20:54.785
<i>(Men cheering)</i>

21:24.016 --> 21:25.950
What is it about
this walking stick?

21:27.653 --> 21:29.954
It's an ancient
holy relic.

21:29.956 --> 21:32.757
It's taken us years
to find it.

21:32.759 --> 21:35.026
There were others with us
who gave their lives for it.

21:38.997 --> 21:41.565
I'm sorry.

21:41.567 --> 21:45.636
We may not be knights,
but we respect that.

21:47.906 --> 21:50.608
There might not be a market
for religious artifacts.

21:52.477 --> 21:54.578
Should we give it
back to them?

21:54.580 --> 21:58.916
- A thief with a conscience?
- Maybe even a heart.

21:58.918 --> 22:01.085
Man: <i>The Lightbringer should not be passed around</i>

22:01.087 --> 22:03.454
like a flagon
of cheap ale.

22:10.762 --> 22:12.330
I told you he'd come
for the Lightbringer.

22:14.700 --> 22:16.534
What is happening here?

22:16.536 --> 22:20.004
<i>What are you two doing</i>
<i>with such companions as these?</i>

22:20.006 --> 22:23.774
What is this flirtation?
Open your eyes. Look.

22:23.776 --> 22:28.346
Is this the people to share
your sacred secrets with?

22:28.348 --> 22:29.847
- She was the one that told--
- No, you!

22:29.849 --> 22:32.083
No, no.

22:32.085 --> 22:34.552
I am disappointed

22:34.554 --> 22:36.520
with both of you.

22:36.522 --> 22:38.089
What would your father
have said now?

22:38.091 --> 22:41.092
And he trusted me
with your care.

22:43.028 --> 22:44.895
Excuse me.

22:48.600 --> 22:50.034
Who are you,
old man?

22:50.036 --> 22:52.737
I am Leonardo Van Helsing.

22:52.739 --> 22:54.705
And who are you?

22:57.442 --> 23:00.077
- I am Lucien Merel.
- A great adventurer.

23:00.079 --> 23:01.679
World's finest poet.

23:01.681 --> 23:03.414
Lover.

23:03.416 --> 23:05.649
Thief.

23:05.651 --> 23:08.519
- Very amusing.
- Very.

23:08.521 --> 23:12.556
My friend,
you have something that belongs to me.

23:12.558 --> 23:14.825
Do I?

23:16.561 --> 23:18.529
<i>(Animal screeching)</i>

23:20.465 --> 23:22.767
Man:
<i>What's going on?</i>

23:22.769 --> 23:24.735
<i>(Horses neighing)</i>

23:26.605 --> 23:28.105
The scourge.

23:31.143 --> 23:33.744
What did you do, old man?
You brought them here.

23:33.746 --> 23:35.546
You fool!

23:35.548 --> 23:37.548
They've come for
the Lightbringer.

23:40.452 --> 23:42.052
Man:
<i>Pack your weapons.</i>

23:54.633 --> 23:56.801
Wrath.

23:59.538 --> 24:01.172
I should have known.

24:05.644 --> 24:08.979
Who here carries
the Lightbringer?

24:08.981 --> 24:10.881
He does.

24:16.054 --> 24:19.223
I stand before you
in the name of God.

24:21.159 --> 24:25.863
Prepare to send you back
from whence you came, demon!

24:27.532 --> 24:29.233
Kill them all.

24:29.235 --> 24:31.469
(Growling, yelling)

25:02.667 --> 25:04.502
Something's wrong.

25:14.746 --> 25:16.747
Protect the Lightbringer.

26:48.173 --> 26:49.873
You're coming with me.

26:52.677 --> 26:54.712
Let go of me!

26:54.714 --> 26:56.680
Lucien!

26:59.184 --> 27:01.118
Alina!

27:05.957 --> 27:08.158
No!

27:25.176 --> 27:27.177
<i>(Thunder rumbling)</i>

28:12.857 --> 28:14.425
(grunts)

28:14.427 --> 28:16.427
Let go of me!

28:22.467 --> 28:24.768
My lord.

28:24.770 --> 28:26.737
Forgive me.

28:26.739 --> 28:30.808
Wrath,
I'm disappointed.

28:30.810 --> 28:33.844
You were but a young boy,
yet you stood bravely against my enemies.

28:33.846 --> 28:36.280
- I will remain loyal to you.
- (Screams)

28:36.282 --> 28:40.017
Now I have given you strength to
match your courage and yet you fail.

28:40.019 --> 28:41.952
How is this possible?

28:41.954 --> 28:44.922
Sire, they used
the Lightbringer.

28:44.924 --> 28:46.924
But that's impossible.

28:46.926 --> 28:49.793
The--

28:49.795 --> 28:51.261
(sniffs)

29:00.271 --> 29:01.505
You.

29:01.507 --> 29:03.741
My God.

29:03.743 --> 29:05.242
Dracula.

29:05.244 --> 29:08.112
<i>You do exist.</i>

29:08.114 --> 29:10.047
Elizabeth.

29:10.049 --> 29:12.983
My friends will come for you
and kill you all.

29:12.985 --> 29:16.120
What is your name?

29:20.024 --> 29:22.459
When my lord asks a question,
you will answer him.

29:22.461 --> 29:24.128
Calm your temper,
my knight.

29:24.130 --> 29:27.231
No reason
to frighten our guest.

29:28.333 --> 29:30.834
Alina.
My name is Alina.

29:30.836 --> 29:32.770
Ah.

29:32.772 --> 29:36.240
A Greek name,
I do believe.

29:36.242 --> 29:38.976
If I'm not mistaken,
it means light.

29:38.978 --> 29:41.278
It also means fire.

29:41.280 --> 29:43.514
You are hurt.

29:43.516 --> 29:46.183
Go ahead,
kill me.

29:46.185 --> 29:48.051
Oh, on the contrary.

29:48.053 --> 29:50.154
No one shall touch you.

29:50.156 --> 29:51.989
Renfield,

29:51.991 --> 29:53.924
show our guest
to the west wing.

29:53.926 --> 29:56.460
- <i>See to her injury.</i>
<i>- The west wing, my lord?</i>

29:56.462 --> 29:59.797
The royal suite...

29:59.799 --> 30:01.965
for Alina of the light.

30:01.967 --> 30:04.134
As you wish,
my lord.

30:05.470 --> 30:07.471
My lord.

30:19.884 --> 30:22.853
<i>(Door opens, closes)</i>

30:42.874 --> 30:45.442
Do not give up hope.

30:45.444 --> 30:47.544
I feel that Alina

30:47.546 --> 30:50.147
may still be alive.

30:51.416 --> 30:53.584
Look on the ground
behind you.

30:55.386 --> 30:57.387
I believe

30:57.389 --> 30:59.389
that this sign
is telling us

30:59.391 --> 31:01.425
that your sister
is not only alive,

31:01.427 --> 31:03.861
but somehow
thriving.

31:05.363 --> 31:06.864
We'll save her.

31:06.866 --> 31:09.366
Leonardo: <i>Yes.</i>

31:09.368 --> 31:11.368
We will leave now.

31:11.370 --> 31:13.637
Even though the scourge
of Dracula's army

31:13.639 --> 31:15.472
cannot rise
in the day,

31:15.474 --> 31:17.975
we will travel
throughout the night

31:17.977 --> 31:20.077
and we will
save her.

31:39.664 --> 31:42.966
- You're not coming?
- No.

31:42.968 --> 31:46.003
- This is where we say goodbye.
- <i>Even after all you've seen?</i>

31:46.005 --> 31:48.272
The scourge, the Lightbringer,
you want to leave?

31:48.274 --> 31:51.241
I don't even know what the Lightbringer
is or why it responded to me.

31:51.243 --> 31:54.111
The question is
not why it chose you,

31:54.113 --> 31:55.646
but who you really are.

31:55.648 --> 31:57.648
Not interested.

31:57.650 --> 32:00.217
Have you not seen
the giant pile of bodies here?

32:00.219 --> 32:01.652
Next time
will be different.

32:01.654 --> 32:03.954
There won't be
a "next time."

32:03.956 --> 32:06.156
Well, what about your friends?
Don't you want to avenge them?

32:06.158 --> 32:07.691
And what good
would that do?

32:07.693 --> 32:09.593
They're dead
and they're not coming back.

32:09.595 --> 32:12.429
Or have you got a little magic
walking stick for that, too?

32:12.431 --> 32:13.664
What about Alina?

32:18.202 --> 32:21.104
What about her?

32:21.106 --> 32:25.008
Come, Esme.
Let us go.

32:25.010 --> 32:28.011
You can't force someone
to do the right thing.

32:28.013 --> 32:31.281
And you don't want
to be alone

32:31.283 --> 32:34.551
when the undead return.

32:42.560 --> 32:45.629
Hey, wait up.

33:03.314 --> 33:05.649
(Sizzles)

33:15.493 --> 33:18.495
My lord,

33:18.497 --> 33:22.065
the Lady Alina
is resting.

33:22.067 --> 33:23.433
What do you think,
Renfield?

33:23.435 --> 33:25.669
There is a remarkable
resemblance.

33:25.671 --> 33:29.272
But is it more?

33:29.274 --> 33:32.609
My lord, be wary
of coincidence.

33:32.611 --> 33:35.112
The girl may bear her face,
but never her soul.

33:35.114 --> 33:37.247
Is it possible

33:37.249 --> 33:38.715
<i>for us to return</i>
<i>to this Earth?</i>

33:38.717 --> 33:42.019
Born again
in another time?

33:42.021 --> 33:45.222
Be careful

33:45.224 --> 33:50.193
where the parts of your mind wander,
my lord.

33:50.195 --> 33:53.430
I fear they will only
lead to disappointment.

33:53.432 --> 33:55.599
I would welcome
disappointment.

33:55.601 --> 33:58.168
The elders said we should
not dwell on the past.

33:58.170 --> 33:59.736
The elders are gone,

33:59.738 --> 34:02.139
along with their
outdated beliefs.

34:02.141 --> 34:04.441
Should not some of their beliefs be reconsidered?

34:04.443 --> 34:06.610
No.

34:06.612 --> 34:09.079
We have our own ways now.

34:12.650 --> 34:16.152
I see you are still young at heart,
my master.

34:28.433 --> 34:32.268
I'm not unsettled.
I need her, Renfield.

34:32.271 --> 34:34.704
Are not the women
of the castle enough to

34:34.706 --> 34:37.206
sate your appetite?

34:37.208 --> 34:39.775
A thousand of them could never
fill the void she left behind.

34:41.813 --> 34:43.813
You should rest.

34:43.815 --> 34:46.248
- How could I possibly think about sleep now?
- (Sizzles)

34:49.120 --> 34:50.821
Power of our armies

34:50.822 --> 34:54.123
lies in your power
of regeneration.

34:54.126 --> 34:57.727
Without it,
it would grow weak.

34:57.729 --> 35:00.730
See to it that
the boards are replaced.

35:00.732 --> 35:03.500
You know my heart
cannot leave this place.

35:10.708 --> 35:13.343
Renfield...

35:13.345 --> 35:15.612
watch over her for me.

35:15.614 --> 35:17.848
Of course, sire.

35:43.841 --> 35:46.343
Esme!

36:00.825 --> 36:02.826
(Groans)

36:17.808 --> 36:20.310
<i>(crows cawing)</i>

37:25.643 --> 37:28.812
Renfield:
<i>Who knows?</i>

37:28.814 --> 37:31.781
<i>The master is beguiled,</i>

37:31.783 --> 37:34.951
<i>grows weak under her spell.</i>
<i>He'll surely make a mistake.</i>

37:36.787 --> 37:38.455
I feel your pain,
my knights.

37:43.794 --> 37:46.463
My lady.

37:46.465 --> 37:47.998
You should be in bed.

37:48.000 --> 37:51.768
And for their failure
to protect his beloved queen,

37:51.770 --> 37:54.304
he imprisoned them
for all eternity.

37:54.306 --> 37:56.773
Renfield:
<i>You know of the four knights?</i>

37:56.775 --> 37:59.809
Yes, but I never
believed them to be true.

37:59.811 --> 38:03.747
Only stories mothers told their little
girls before they went to sleep at night.

38:03.749 --> 38:06.883
And what story did
your mother tell you?

38:06.885 --> 38:10.654
Once there was a great,
handsome prince

38:10.656 --> 38:14.858
who fought gallantly
for Transylvania.

38:14.860 --> 38:16.926
He defended us
against our enemies

38:16.928 --> 38:19.029
until one day

38:19.031 --> 38:21.631
he turned to the dark side.

38:21.633 --> 38:23.867
He lost his faith.

38:23.869 --> 38:26.936
He put his own selfish
desires ahead of God's.

38:26.938 --> 38:29.506
<i>He was let down</i>
<i>by his knights</i>

38:29.508 --> 38:32.042
who were supposed
to protect his one true love.

38:33.778 --> 38:36.379
His princess.

38:36.381 --> 38:39.482
Elizabeth.

38:39.484 --> 38:43.053
He was a great knight.

38:43.055 --> 38:47.357
This country owes him a great
debt for his sacrifice and courage.

38:47.359 --> 38:49.826
Yes, he...

38:49.828 --> 38:52.862
loved his princess
with all his soul.

38:55.800 --> 38:58.902
What do you know
of love?

38:58.904 --> 39:00.670
God is love.

39:00.672 --> 39:03.606
Everything else is a pale shadow in comparison.

39:03.608 --> 39:05.775
(Chuckles)

39:05.777 --> 39:07.577
Well,
perhaps that explains

39:07.579 --> 39:09.746
why my master prefers
the shadows.

39:15.753 --> 39:18.655
Here...

39:18.657 --> 39:21.424
God has no power.

39:33.137 --> 39:35.372
How can you serve
such a demon?

39:40.678 --> 39:43.713
There is much you do not understand about loyalty.

39:43.715 --> 39:46.383
I was born into
the Keepers of the Light.

39:46.385 --> 39:49.386
The first words we learn are oaths of honor and loyalty.

39:49.388 --> 39:52.555
My loyalty
is to the land.

39:52.557 --> 39:56.559
And as long as my master
rules over it, to him.

39:59.029 --> 40:03.466
Your master is a monster
that should be destroyed.

40:03.468 --> 40:05.702
There is no

40:05.704 --> 40:08.071
earthly power

40:08.073 --> 40:12.008
that can defeat my lord.

40:12.010 --> 40:14.511
What about
the Lightbringer?

40:23.421 --> 40:25.755
<i>(Crows cawing)</i>

40:28.159 --> 40:30.427
Leonardo: <i>Lucien,</i>

40:30.429 --> 40:32.529
<i>what do you know</i>
<i>of your past?</i>

40:32.531 --> 40:34.597
Lucien: <i>My parents died when I was very young</i>

40:34.599 --> 40:37.700
and the only other family I've
known was killed last night.

40:37.702 --> 40:38.968
Leonardo:
<i>What if I told you</i>

40:38.970 --> 40:41.638
you were from
the bloodline of Cain?

40:41.640 --> 40:43.440
Who?

40:43.442 --> 40:45.942
From the Bible and the Book of Genesis.
Cain and Abel.

40:45.944 --> 40:47.811
I don't go to church much.

40:47.813 --> 40:50.847
After Cain
killed his brother,

40:50.849 --> 40:54.050
God condemned him
and his offspring

40:54.052 --> 40:56.519
<i>to a life of crime</i>
<i>as murderous cutthroats--</i>

40:56.521 --> 40:58.087
and thieves.

40:58.089 --> 41:00.657
Isn't half of humanity
related to Cain?

41:00.659 --> 41:03.960
Leonardo: <i>On the contrary,
Adam and Eve had many children.</i>

41:03.962 --> 41:05.061
Cain was the firstborn,

41:05.063 --> 41:07.130
then Abel,
then Seth.

41:07.132 --> 41:10.667
Okay, spare me
the whole family tree.

41:11.969 --> 41:14.938
You, my boy,

41:14.940 --> 41:17.540
are a very rare breed.

41:17.542 --> 41:19.209
Tell me something
I don't know.

41:31.222 --> 41:33.189
There they are.

41:33.191 --> 41:36.693
The Carpathian Mountains.

41:40.998 --> 41:44.234
Bows and arrow
don't even faze him.

41:46.537 --> 41:49.172
You're wasting your time.

41:51.709 --> 41:53.643
At least
we're doing something.

41:53.645 --> 41:57.113
Yeah, something that's
gonna get you both killed.

41:57.115 --> 42:00.650
Alas,
Lucien is right.

42:00.652 --> 42:04.187
Our weapons are
a feeble defense at best.

42:05.256 --> 42:07.824
Told ya.

42:10.895 --> 42:13.162
Leonardo:
<i>The Lightbringer--</i>

42:13.164 --> 42:15.031
the Lightbringer
must work for us.

42:15.033 --> 42:17.133
<i>We must find a way.</i>

42:20.137 --> 42:21.838
Let me see.

42:57.841 --> 42:59.909
Why doesn't it work
for you two?

43:01.745 --> 43:04.147
Oh, well,
I guess the Lightbringer only responds

43:04.149 --> 43:08.918
to the bloodline
of its former master.

43:10.321 --> 43:11.988
All right.

43:15.993 --> 43:17.594
Let me try.

43:38.849 --> 43:41.618
Well, so much
for your theory.

43:41.620 --> 43:43.753
I don't understand.
It worked for him before.

43:46.624 --> 43:48.358
Something must have changed.

43:51.195 --> 43:53.863
He must be
of the blood of Cain.

43:57.635 --> 43:59.135
The blood of Cain.

44:03.140 --> 44:04.407
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

44:04.409 --> 44:06.643
What are you doing?!

44:06.645 --> 44:08.378
Ah!

44:30.401 --> 44:32.235
Now...

44:32.237 --> 44:34.070
you must believe.

44:49.720 --> 44:52.922
It's fitting that Cain killed his brother with a scythe.

44:52.924 --> 44:54.724
He was a farmer,
you know.

44:54.726 --> 44:56.893
Keep your feet
under you.

44:56.895 --> 44:58.961
- Yeah, I'm trying. I'm trying.
- Always balance, balance, balance.

44:58.963 --> 45:00.463
Never cross your legs.

45:00.465 --> 45:02.198
Just balance.
Dance, you see?

45:02.200 --> 45:04.367
Keep your movement fluid.

45:04.369 --> 45:06.836
<i>You'll get it.</i>
<i>You'll see.</i>

45:06.838 --> 45:09.005
Tell me, old man,
how do you think this thing's

45:09.007 --> 45:10.840
even going to beat
Dracula's army?

45:10.842 --> 45:14.243
Because Dracula is a descendant of Abel.

45:16.280 --> 45:19.882
If God cursed Cain
and his offspring,

45:19.884 --> 45:22.318
what would he have
bestowed on the sons of Abel?

45:22.320 --> 45:24.320
The favored ones.

45:24.322 --> 45:26.122
Come, come, come!

45:26.124 --> 45:27.890
I don't know,
I'm not good at riddles.

45:27.892 --> 45:29.892
A life of nobility
and privilege.

45:29.894 --> 45:32.161
A life of
nobility and privilege.

45:32.163 --> 45:34.197
And what was
Dracula before

45:34.199 --> 45:36.499
he embraced
the powers of evil?

45:36.501 --> 45:38.201
A prince?

45:38.203 --> 45:39.902
A prince.

45:41.805 --> 45:43.406
The Lightbringer,

45:43.408 --> 45:46.743
the original weapon
that killed Abel,

45:46.745 --> 45:50.313
is the only thing
that can kill Dracula.

45:50.315 --> 45:54.083
So what happens if Dracula gets a hold of this thing?

45:54.085 --> 45:58.921
Dracula is from
the blood of Abel.

45:58.923 --> 46:00.923
The Lightbringer

46:00.925 --> 46:03.459
does the opposite.

46:03.461 --> 46:05.528
It brings the dead

46:05.530 --> 46:07.797
to life.

46:11.168 --> 46:15.104
<i>(Roaring, fluttering)</i>

46:15.106 --> 46:16.939
<i>(women giggling)</i>

46:19.910 --> 46:22.945
Where are you going?

46:22.947 --> 46:25.148
I'm leaving.

46:25.150 --> 46:26.849
And you should, too.

46:26.851 --> 46:28.384
But why?

46:28.386 --> 46:30.386
<i>This is my home.</i>
<i>I like it here.</i>

46:30.388 --> 46:33.823
The person who owns this castle is a very evil man.

46:33.825 --> 46:36.058
If you can even
call him a man.

46:36.060 --> 46:38.294
He's nice to us.
I'll show you.

46:40.197 --> 46:43.900
<i>(Music playing, laughing)</i>

46:49.573 --> 46:52.108
(hisses)

47:08.025 --> 47:10.059
<i>(voices overlapping)</i>

47:46.263 --> 47:48.231
Woman:
<i>Lie down.</i>

47:53.170 --> 47:55.905
<i>Alina...</i>

48:19.029 --> 48:21.197
I had no idea she'd left her room,
Your Majesty.

48:21.199 --> 48:22.531
Is she all right?

48:36.546 --> 48:38.948
Ah!

48:43.453 --> 48:46.689
Life is learning
everyone has challenges.

48:46.691 --> 48:49.258
Well, that's easy to say when you're
not carrying the curse of Cain.

48:49.260 --> 48:50.593
Here we are.

48:50.595 --> 48:54.263
Welcome to Bistritz.

48:54.265 --> 48:57.700
<i>The crossroads for every demon slayer on this edge</i>

48:57.702 --> 49:00.136
of the Carpathian Mountains.

49:00.138 --> 49:01.470
Could use a drink.

49:01.472 --> 49:03.606
Slayers do not
consume alcohol.

49:03.608 --> 49:05.675
Esme: It dulls the mind and slows the senses.

49:05.677 --> 49:07.410
Well, good job
I'm not a slayer, then.

49:21.692 --> 49:24.560
None of that.

49:24.562 --> 49:26.595
Here.

49:26.597 --> 49:29.332
Why is your head down?

49:29.334 --> 49:30.967
What are you
thinking about?

49:30.969 --> 49:32.301
Nothing.

49:32.303 --> 49:34.437
The past is not nothing.

49:35.706 --> 49:37.974
Let me console you.

49:37.976 --> 49:39.608
<i>Only when you know</i>
<i>who you truly are</i>

49:39.610 --> 49:42.445
can you use it for good.

49:43.547 --> 49:45.448
Don't feel sorry
for yourself.

49:45.450 --> 49:47.450
I'm not feeling anything.

49:47.452 --> 49:50.119
I don't know
what he's talking about.

50:01.131 --> 50:02.732
Seat's taken.

50:09.272 --> 50:11.507
Have respect.

50:11.509 --> 50:13.509
This is family.

50:13.511 --> 50:16.712
This is kindred.

50:16.714 --> 50:20.049
To whom do I have
the honor to speak?

50:20.051 --> 50:21.717
My name is Andros.

50:21.719 --> 50:24.086
Son of Cormac
the Wolf Slayer.

50:24.088 --> 50:26.088
I'm a demon hunter.

50:26.090 --> 50:28.724
From where have you come, Andros?
You've come a long way?

50:28.726 --> 50:31.327
Beyond the frozen seas,
far to the north.

50:31.329 --> 50:34.697
You sit with us.
These are my good friends.

50:34.699 --> 50:38.768
Barkeep, bring us as much food
as this table will hold.

50:38.770 --> 50:42.171
We may not drink,
but that doesn't mean we can't eat like horses.

50:42.173 --> 50:43.606
(Laughing)

50:45.142 --> 50:47.309
<i>So tell me,</i>

50:47.311 --> 50:49.311
what brings you
to Bistritz?

50:49.313 --> 50:52.515
Tales of a demon
called Dracula

50:52.517 --> 50:56.085
and of a slayer called Van
Helsing who seeks to hunt him.

50:58.155 --> 51:00.222
I am Van Helsing.

51:05.295 --> 51:08.764
In my land, these demons
are called Gruntiak.

51:08.766 --> 51:12.168
<i>My sister was taken</i>
<i>by these creatures.</i>

51:12.170 --> 51:14.336
Now,
I've spent many years

51:14.338 --> 51:16.639
traveling,
avenging my family--

51:16.641 --> 51:18.641
Long time
to hold a grudge.

51:23.814 --> 51:27.850
What we are fighting here
is no ordinary demon...

51:29.386 --> 51:31.454
but a vampire.

51:36.827 --> 51:39.662
<i>Lord Dracula</i>

51:39.664 --> 51:42.832
<i>is as strong as 100 men</i>

51:42.834 --> 51:44.600
<i>and as cunning</i>

51:44.602 --> 51:48.237
as he is strong.

51:48.239 --> 51:51.340
He lures his followers
with promises

51:51.342 --> 51:53.809
<i>of eternal life</i>

51:53.811 --> 51:57.213
<i>and beauty.</i>

51:57.215 --> 51:59.849
<i>To drink from his blood,</i>

51:59.851 --> 52:03.719
<i>to become one of them.</i>

52:03.721 --> 52:06.355
<i>But you become</i>

52:06.357 --> 52:08.858
<i>a slave to the curse.</i>

52:08.860 --> 52:13.329
The blood is the life.

52:13.331 --> 52:15.865
Well, we should be safe
if we don't drink his blood.

52:15.867 --> 52:17.867
Unless you are bitten.

52:17.869 --> 52:21.337
<i>In that case,</i>
<i>you have three choices;</i>

52:21.339 --> 52:24.440
you can pray
for a quick death,

52:24.442 --> 52:26.775
<i>you can drink from him</i>
<i>and live</i>

52:26.777 --> 52:29.612
<i>forever,</i>

52:29.614 --> 52:33.149
or you can turn
into the accursed.

52:34.784 --> 52:36.318
Nosferatu.

52:36.320 --> 52:37.853
Nosferatu.

52:37.855 --> 52:40.523
<i>From necurat,</i>

52:40.525 --> 52:42.791
<i>meaning unclean</i>

52:42.793 --> 52:45.628
and a sufferite.

52:45.630 --> 52:48.831
<i>A suffering to be bitten</i>

52:48.833 --> 52:51.600
<i>and not drink</i>
<i>from Dracula's blood</i>

52:51.602 --> 52:53.869
is a suffering
without end.

52:53.871 --> 52:56.305
(Screams)

53:02.679 --> 53:04.813
So, my warrior friend,

53:04.815 --> 53:06.882
now that I have told you,

53:06.884 --> 53:10.653
is this danger a price
you are willing to pay?

53:10.655 --> 53:13.889
I do not fear it.

53:13.891 --> 53:17.660
Yeah, pay attention,

53:17.662 --> 53:19.929
young ones.

53:20.964 --> 53:23.599
Throughout history,

53:23.601 --> 53:26.669
whenever barbaric poisons
have taken hold

53:26.671 --> 53:30.739
and evil seems poised
to flood the Earth,

53:30.741 --> 53:34.577
heroes have always
risen up,

53:34.579 --> 53:37.813
willing even to sacrifice
themselves

53:37.815 --> 53:39.582
that future generations

53:39.584 --> 53:42.451
<i>have the opportunity</i>
<i>to seek peace.</i>

53:42.453 --> 53:46.589
These heroes
are from God himself.

53:46.591 --> 53:48.791
I am always humbled

53:48.793 --> 53:50.960
<i>to be in their presence</i>

53:50.962 --> 53:53.662
and I have striven always
to be one of them.

53:53.664 --> 53:56.599
I would drink to that.

53:56.601 --> 53:57.866
<i>If you let me.</i>

53:57.868 --> 53:59.935
I am happy to be
with each of you.

54:02.906 --> 54:06.775
We haven't been
introduced.

54:06.777 --> 54:08.711
I'm Esme,

54:08.713 --> 54:10.546
slayer in training.

54:10.548 --> 54:12.748
And the rude one here
is Lucien.

54:12.750 --> 54:15.818
I wouldn't be in such a mood if
you just let me have some wine.

54:15.820 --> 54:18.988
Wine's no good.
It dulls the mind and slows the senses.

54:18.990 --> 54:22.791
Spoken like a true slayer.
(Laughs)

54:22.793 --> 54:24.493
It's a conspiracy.

54:24.495 --> 54:26.362
It is.
It's a conspiracy.

54:28.565 --> 54:30.499
<i>(Thunder rumbling)</i>

55:00.897 --> 55:02.998
Do not fear me.

55:03.000 --> 55:05.301
I saw what you did
to those girls.

55:05.303 --> 55:08.037
I perform acts of mercy,

55:08.039 --> 55:09.805
yet you would
call for my head.

55:09.807 --> 55:13.042
You have a distorted
notion of mercy, sir.

55:13.044 --> 55:16.612
I give eternal life
so those may live in peace

55:16.614 --> 55:18.614
and happiness.

55:18.616 --> 55:21.784
Only the Lord God
can give eternal life.

55:21.786 --> 55:23.952
I should kill you now
for your blasphemy.

55:23.954 --> 55:27.356
You would not be
the first to try,

55:27.358 --> 55:30.359
but I think you would find I'm a very difficult man to kill.

55:30.361 --> 55:32.394
You're no man.

55:32.396 --> 55:35.998
<i>You're a demon.</i>

55:36.000 --> 55:38.334
A man I was once.

55:40.870 --> 55:43.672
A man I may yet again
hope to become.

55:51.915 --> 55:53.749
Alina:
<i>She was very beautiful.</i>

55:53.751 --> 55:56.885
Yes, she was.

55:56.887 --> 55:59.088
I'm sorry for your loss.

56:03.493 --> 56:05.561
Dracula: <i>It was given to the Queen of Sheba</i>

56:05.563 --> 56:07.763
<i>by King Solomon himself.</i>

56:12.702 --> 56:15.104
A token of his eternal love
and devotion.

56:17.107 --> 56:20.442
- Why don't you try it on?
- I couldn't.

56:20.444 --> 56:23.946
But you are my guest,
I insist.

57:00.817 --> 57:03.018
It looks better on you
than on display.

57:09.192 --> 57:10.959
Am I a prisoner here?

57:13.463 --> 57:15.030
Of course not.

57:15.032 --> 57:17.800
May I leave?

57:18.968 --> 57:21.837
Not just yet.

57:21.839 --> 57:24.173
Then I'd like to go
back to my room.

57:30.146 --> 57:33.115
Leonardo:
<i>We leave for Bukovina.</i>

57:33.117 --> 57:36.785
There have been reports of activity near the Borgo Pass.

57:36.787 --> 57:39.755
We start there.

57:39.757 --> 57:42.858
Wait, you don't even know
where Dracula's castle is?

57:42.860 --> 57:44.660
No one does.

57:44.662 --> 57:46.161
It is rumored

57:46.163 --> 57:48.664
to be on the crest
of the Carpathian Mountains

57:48.666 --> 57:51.667
<i>near to the Borgo Pass.</i>

57:51.669 --> 57:55.571
Renfield: I'm told that slayers are
gathering in growing numbers in Bistritz.

57:56.673 --> 57:59.141
Something amiss,
my lord?

57:59.143 --> 58:02.911
Heavy loneliness
eats at my heart.

58:02.913 --> 58:05.481
Let me guess,
Miss Alina.

58:05.483 --> 58:08.884
She will never see me
as anything but a monster.

58:08.886 --> 58:12.120
I should turn her.
Make her one of us.

58:12.122 --> 58:14.756
I don't know
if that's wise, sire.

58:14.758 --> 58:17.226
<i>If she is indeed</i>
<i>your true love,</i>

58:17.228 --> 58:18.894
give her time
to remember.

58:18.896 --> 58:22.030
If she loved you once,
she'll love you again.

58:22.032 --> 58:23.899
My lord.

58:30.840 --> 58:33.842
Never have I regretted
what I have become...

58:36.546 --> 58:38.747
until now.

58:41.017 --> 58:43.919
<i>(Screaming)</i>

58:43.921 --> 58:47.155
They are in Bistritz.
It's not like them to attack an entire village.

58:47.157 --> 58:49.024
They're becoming
more aggressive.

58:49.026 --> 58:50.726
Or desperate.

58:50.728 --> 58:54.930
Go, we still have
to protect them.

59:01.638 --> 59:03.639
<i>(Thunder rumbling)</i>

59:13.883 --> 59:15.884
(screaming)

59:25.762 --> 59:28.263
Wrath!

59:28.265 --> 59:30.032
A noble hero.

59:30.034 --> 59:31.266
Make that two.

59:31.268 --> 59:33.268
Where is my sister?

59:33.270 --> 59:36.138
She's with the master.

59:36.140 --> 59:37.239
Remember me?

59:37.241 --> 59:39.708
Why, if it isn't the thief.

59:39.710 --> 59:41.577
I've learned something
new about myself.

59:52.021 --> 59:54.690
Kill them all.

01:00:31.094 --> 01:00:33.328
(Groans)

01:00:59.055 --> 01:01:01.390
You've done it.
You've done it!

01:01:01.392 --> 01:01:03.859
<i>Dear Lucien,</i>
<i>you've done it.</i>

01:01:08.031 --> 01:01:11.033
(Panting)
Wrath.

01:01:12.235 --> 01:01:14.936
Not bad for
a half-trained boy.

01:01:14.938 --> 01:01:18.340
When they return
for the Lightbringer,

01:01:18.342 --> 01:01:20.776
they will be
in full force.

01:01:20.778 --> 01:01:22.144
Esme, where are you going?

01:01:22.146 --> 01:01:24.212
To get my sister.

01:01:24.214 --> 01:01:25.781
I'm coming with you.

01:01:27.884 --> 01:01:31.386
The young ones
have taken over.

01:01:31.388 --> 01:01:33.021
Shall we?

01:01:35.124 --> 01:01:37.926
I may have one more
battle left in me.

01:01:46.235 --> 01:01:48.103
My champion.

01:01:48.105 --> 01:01:49.938
Greatest of
all my warriors.

01:01:49.940 --> 01:01:51.740
Wrath:
<i>The boy...</i>

01:01:51.742 --> 01:01:55.243
he wields
the Lightbringer.

01:01:57.146 --> 01:01:59.481
He is a descendant of Cain.

01:01:59.483 --> 01:02:01.750
We've underestimated him.

01:02:01.752 --> 01:02:03.952
I will give you what you need to defend him.

01:02:26.242 --> 01:02:27.876
Go.

01:02:31.047 --> 01:02:33.248
Bring the
Lightbringer to me.

01:04:38.074 --> 01:04:39.274
(Screams)

01:04:41.544 --> 01:04:43.411
(gasps)

01:05:16.479 --> 01:05:18.480
I think I remember.

01:05:20.583 --> 01:05:24.185
Do not weep for the past,
dear Alina.

01:05:24.187 --> 01:05:28.056
<i>Too many tears have already been shed.</i>
<i>Come.</i>

01:05:28.058 --> 01:05:30.258
<i>Let me show you something.</i>

01:05:35.698 --> 01:05:39.367
'Tis here I seek
my solace in stars.

01:05:45.041 --> 01:05:48.977
According to Plato,
the universe is one soul divided into equal parts,

01:05:48.979 --> 01:05:52.247
each one assigned
to a star.

01:05:52.249 --> 01:05:55.250
And those who live
a full and virtuous life

01:05:55.252 --> 01:05:57.652
return to their
native star

01:05:57.654 --> 01:06:01.323
while others
return to Earth,

01:06:01.325 --> 01:06:05.427
again and again,
until they find their life's true purpose.

01:06:05.429 --> 01:06:07.429
All these years,

01:06:07.431 --> 01:06:09.064
I've searched the skies,

01:06:09.066 --> 01:06:11.366
hoping to find the light
of my one true love.

01:06:11.368 --> 01:06:14.536
I don't understand.

01:06:14.538 --> 01:06:17.138
Search your heart...

01:06:19.675 --> 01:06:21.676
and find me.

01:06:39.328 --> 01:06:41.596
(Horse neighs)

01:06:50.172 --> 01:06:51.439
I thought
he was dead.

01:06:51.441 --> 01:06:54.309
Dracula
has powers

01:06:54.311 --> 01:06:56.177
of which we can
only dream.

01:06:56.179 --> 01:06:58.346
Andros: <i>He's come through the Borgo Pass.</i>

01:06:58.348 --> 01:07:01.116
We must be
very close now.

01:07:03.619 --> 01:07:05.487
I am sure.

01:08:02.311 --> 01:08:04.612
Do we even know
what we're looking for?

01:08:04.614 --> 01:08:08.583
Castle would have to be
in a defensible position.

01:08:08.585 --> 01:08:11.586
On a mountain.
Against a cliff.

01:08:11.588 --> 01:08:14.422
- I just hope we're not too late.
- Have faith.

01:08:14.424 --> 01:08:17.125
Look who's talking
about faith now.

01:08:17.127 --> 01:08:19.828
(Laughs)
Dear Lucien.

01:08:24.533 --> 01:08:26.301
There's a compass.

01:08:33.876 --> 01:08:35.443
But it's not
heading north.

01:08:40.816 --> 01:08:42.684
Esme:
<i>Maybe it's not supposed to.</i>

01:08:49.725 --> 01:08:52.527
Paprika hen... fowl.

01:08:52.529 --> 01:08:55.263
Prepared in the traditional
Hungarian fashion.

01:08:55.265 --> 01:08:58.832
Just the way you like it.
I-- I'm sure you will like it.

01:09:01.203 --> 01:09:02.770
Are you not having any?

01:09:02.772 --> 01:09:05.640
Alas,
my palate

01:09:05.642 --> 01:09:07.542
has changed
over the years.

01:09:07.544 --> 01:09:09.676
(Scoffs)
Of course.

01:09:09.679 --> 01:09:11.279
I'd forgotten.

01:09:11.281 --> 01:09:14.149
Oh.
(Chuckles)

01:09:16.719 --> 01:09:18.520
Why do you want
the Lightbringer so badly?

01:09:18.522 --> 01:09:20.854
What do you need
with yet another weapon?

01:09:20.857 --> 01:09:22.590
<i>Oh, it's not just a weapon.</i>

01:09:22.591 --> 01:09:24.725
With the Lightbringer,
I can assure that no one

01:09:24.728 --> 01:09:26.394
ever loses
the ones they love.

01:09:26.395 --> 01:09:28.363
You'd make yourself
equal to God?

01:09:28.365 --> 01:09:33.167
Oh, not at all.
No, God has the power to create life.

01:09:33.170 --> 01:09:36.537
I'll just prevent him
from taking it away.

01:09:36.540 --> 01:09:38.406
Renfield: <i>Ahem.</i>

01:09:38.408 --> 01:09:40.774
Apologies for
the intrusion, sire.

01:09:40.777 --> 01:09:42.844
Wrath sends word

01:09:42.845 --> 01:09:45.580
that the thief and his comrades are heading this way.

01:09:45.582 --> 01:09:46.781
Lucien.

01:09:50.352 --> 01:09:52.187
You know this man?

01:09:52.189 --> 01:09:54.556
Um...

01:09:55.724 --> 01:09:57.725
he'll be
with my sister.

01:09:57.727 --> 01:09:59.460
They'll be looking for me.

01:09:59.462 --> 01:10:01.596
Many have tried
to find this place.

01:10:01.598 --> 01:10:04.465
All have failed.

01:10:04.467 --> 01:10:07.368
We are hidden
from the eyes of mortals.

01:10:10.773 --> 01:10:12.941
Do you have feelings
for this man?

01:10:12.943 --> 01:10:15.343

01:10:15.345 --> 01:10:16.945

01:10:18.881 --> 01:10:21.449
I...

01:10:21.451 --> 01:10:23.418
seem to have lost
my appetite.

01:10:26.956 --> 01:10:28.690
If you'll excuse me.

Blood will make
you feel better.

01:11:32.755 --> 01:11:34.656
Drink from me.

01:11:40.696 --> 01:11:42.597
I cannot.

01:11:42.599 --> 01:11:43.931
Leave me.

01:11:45.668 --> 01:11:47.335
Leave me.

We're close.

01:12:18.500 --> 01:12:20.401
Then let's hurry.

01:12:43.092 --> 01:12:44.926
Esme:
<i>I don't see anything.</i>

01:13:00.943 --> 01:13:03.077
It should be here.

01:13:08.650 --> 01:13:11.152
Wait...
I see something.

01:13:15.491 --> 01:13:17.692
There.

01:13:37.646 --> 01:13:40.148
After a lifetime...

01:13:40.150 --> 01:13:42.016
finally.

01:13:43.652 --> 01:13:47.422
Now we need
to find a way inside.

01:13:47.424 --> 01:13:49.924
Only two choices;

01:13:49.926 --> 01:13:53.194
up or under.

01:13:53.196 --> 01:13:55.930
(Laughs)
And how would you know?

01:13:55.932 --> 01:13:59.033
When you've robbed
as many castles as I have,

01:13:59.035 --> 01:14:02.003
you'd know it's only
towers and dungeons.

01:14:02.005 --> 01:14:05.473
Royals have
no imagination.

01:14:05.475 --> 01:14:07.742
So who goes up

01:14:07.744 --> 01:14:10.044
and who goes under?

01:14:28.630 --> 01:14:31.532
- (Groans)
- The smell of death.

01:14:33.068 --> 01:14:34.769
(Grunts)

01:14:41.210 --> 01:14:43.077
This is disgusting.

01:14:43.079 --> 01:14:45.947
Andros: Maybe the smell will keep the vampires away.

01:14:53.255 --> 01:14:57.024
Now we must divide.

01:14:57.026 --> 01:15:01.162
Esme, you stay
with Andros.

01:15:01.164 --> 01:15:03.564
Godspeed,
my friend.

01:15:03.566 --> 01:15:05.867
Until we meet again.

01:15:11.073 --> 01:15:13.975
Come on.
Let's find Alina.

01:15:28.590 --> 01:15:30.224

01:15:57.753 --> 01:15:59.287
Wrath.

01:16:13.201 --> 01:16:14.835
Just you and me.

01:16:57.646 --> 01:16:59.347
I thought I'd never
see you again.

01:17:01.350 --> 01:17:04.118
My luck.
Come on, let's go.

Stand for
the master.

01:17:17.700 --> 01:17:20.001
You've waited for this moment
for so many years.

01:17:20.003 --> 01:17:22.837
And here you are.
Welcome.

01:17:22.839 --> 01:17:25.106
I have come
with no other intent

01:17:25.108 --> 01:17:29.043
but to end your poisonous ways forever.

01:17:29.045 --> 01:17:30.978
I believe you.

01:17:30.980 --> 01:17:35.216
And yet I'm impressed with you.

01:17:35.218 --> 01:17:37.151
Your courage.

01:17:37.153 --> 01:17:40.021
Your fortitude.

01:17:40.023 --> 01:17:41.889
Your persistence.

01:17:41.891 --> 01:17:44.325
Your knowledge

01:17:44.327 --> 01:17:46.394
about me.

01:17:46.396 --> 01:17:49.864
And in many ways,
perhaps you know me better than I know myself.

01:17:49.866 --> 01:17:53.734
If I were to make you
one of mine...

01:17:55.804 --> 01:17:58.706
what conversations
you and I could have.

01:18:03.078 --> 01:18:05.146
Have you turned the girl?

01:18:05.148 --> 01:18:06.814
No.

01:18:09.284 --> 01:18:11.218
Not yet.

01:18:13.055 --> 01:18:16.390
What can I offer you
to set her free?

01:18:18.427 --> 01:18:20.261
I'm afraid
I can't do that.

01:18:20.263 --> 01:18:23.030
Lord Dracula,

01:18:23.032 --> 01:18:24.965
have you ever
considered

01:18:24.967 --> 01:18:27.268
that this God
you turned against

01:18:27.270 --> 01:18:28.836
truly does exist

01:18:28.838 --> 01:18:30.237
and if you take this girl,

01:18:30.239 --> 01:18:32.873
you will never be able
to forgive yourself?

01:18:36.912 --> 01:18:38.446
You're suggesting
that my soul

01:18:38.448 --> 01:18:41.382
is not completely lost.

01:18:41.384 --> 01:18:44.051
No one,
in my thought,

01:18:44.053 --> 01:18:45.786
is completely lost.

01:18:45.788 --> 01:18:47.822
I see it,
they have the power

01:18:47.824 --> 01:18:51.392
to seek redemption
and God's mercy.

01:18:51.394 --> 01:18:54.228
Renfield.

01:18:57.299 --> 01:19:00.468
Master Van Helsing,
we'll speak again.

01:19:04.172 --> 01:19:05.873
We will let him live.

01:19:07.409 --> 01:19:08.776
For now.

01:19:08.778 --> 01:19:10.878
I must rest.

01:19:17.185 --> 01:19:19.520
Could it be
any darker down here?

01:19:19.522 --> 01:19:22.089
The dead don't need
any light.

01:19:23.992 --> 01:19:25.826
Where are
your companions?

01:19:25.828 --> 01:19:29.263
The one who wields
the Lightbringer.

01:19:29.265 --> 01:19:31.265
He is coming.

01:19:31.267 --> 01:19:33.501
Good.

01:19:33.503 --> 01:19:35.970

we were hoping.

Leonardo, get up.

01:20:22.585 --> 01:20:24.118
Get up!

01:20:24.120 --> 01:20:26.086
Andros:
<i>Stand back!</i>

01:20:33.461 --> 01:20:36.197
Woman:
<i>Andros.</i>

01:20:38.266 --> 01:20:40.868
<i>Andros.</i>

01:20:46.575 --> 01:20:48.175
Demetria?

01:20:50.912 --> 01:20:53.180
My brother.

01:20:53.182 --> 01:20:55.282
You've come for me.

01:20:58.587 --> 01:21:00.588
I thought you were dead.

01:21:00.590 --> 01:21:03.023
Andros, that's not
your sister.

01:21:03.025 --> 01:21:04.892
I've missed you.

01:21:04.894 --> 01:21:07.995
Come to me.

01:21:07.997 --> 01:21:12.099
To see you again, here,

01:21:12.101 --> 01:21:14.435
it's like a dream.

01:21:14.437 --> 01:21:15.603
Andros!

01:21:15.605 --> 01:21:20.007
Yes, my brother,
a dream.

01:21:20.009 --> 01:21:22.376
<i>From which</i>
<i>is there no wakening.</i>

01:21:22.378 --> 01:21:24.111
(Growls)

01:21:24.113 --> 01:21:26.547
- (screams)
- Andros: <i>Demetria, no!</i>

01:21:27.649 --> 01:21:29.884
Hurry.
Over here.

01:21:38.593 --> 01:21:40.561
Andros, help!

01:21:40.563 --> 01:21:42.997
Get away from her.

01:21:42.999 --> 01:21:45.466
Come on,
let's go.

01:21:45.468 --> 01:21:47.201
Esme.

01:21:50.939 --> 01:21:54.241
Over there.
Watch out.

01:21:59.214 --> 01:22:01.649
- Leonardo.
- Alina!

01:22:06.454 --> 01:22:08.923
- Esme!
- I knew we'd find you. I never gave up hope.

01:22:08.925 --> 01:22:11.025
- Lucien: <i>Protect the girls!</i>
<i>- He's not moving.</i>

01:22:11.027 --> 01:22:12.693
- Leonardo.
- No.

01:22:19.668 --> 01:22:22.303
We're completely surrounded.

01:22:22.305 --> 01:22:25.072
- <i>I'm not leaving you, old man.</i>
<i>- Go, go away!</i>

01:22:25.074 --> 01:22:26.974
- No.
- I've been bitten.

01:22:26.976 --> 01:22:28.676
It's only
a matter of time

01:22:28.678 --> 01:22:31.679
before the transformation
is complete.

01:22:31.681 --> 01:22:34.581
- No.
- Then we'll all go together.

01:22:41.323 --> 01:22:44.959
Esme, get me my crossbow

01:22:44.961 --> 01:22:46.460
<i>and twine.</i>

01:22:46.462 --> 01:22:47.695
Twine.

01:22:50.565 --> 01:22:52.566
I love you all.

01:22:54.169 --> 01:22:56.470
And your father

01:22:56.472 --> 01:22:58.505
would be proud of you.

01:23:00.976 --> 01:23:02.710
And whatever blessings

01:23:02.712 --> 01:23:05.012
I have left to give...

01:23:07.148 --> 01:23:09.116
I give them...

01:23:09.118 --> 01:23:10.651
to you.

01:23:10.653 --> 01:23:12.286
No.

01:23:17.993 --> 01:23:19.693
(Screaming, hissing)

01:23:30.005 --> 01:23:33.007
Leonardo, no!

01:23:38.780 --> 01:23:41.715
Andros: <i>We're running out of daylight.</i>

01:23:41.717 --> 01:23:43.650
Let's go, let's go.
Come on, come on.

01:23:43.652 --> 01:23:45.719
- Come on. Let's go.
- Andros: Go!

01:23:48.189 --> 01:23:52.259
- (Screaming)
- Now, now, go! Take her!

01:23:54.129 --> 01:23:56.030
Come on!

01:24:00.068 --> 01:24:01.602
Don't stop! Go!

01:24:09.411 --> 01:24:10.744
Catch.

01:24:12.313 --> 01:24:14.715
Out the window,
both of you!

01:24:29.097 --> 01:24:31.131
(Yells)

01:24:32.767 --> 01:24:34.835
(screams)

01:24:40.542 --> 01:24:42.242
Lucien:
The sun is setting.

01:24:43.711 --> 01:24:45.145
Andros:
<i>Into the woods.</i>

01:25:30.225 --> 01:25:32.226
(Growls, screaming)

01:26:09.631 --> 01:26:11.532
(growls)

01:26:12.767 --> 01:26:14.635
Sire.

01:26:18.706 --> 01:26:21.308
Do not confuse your friends
for your enemies.

01:26:21.310 --> 01:26:24.211
I have but one enemy now.

01:26:25.847 --> 01:26:29.449
We have the location and the layout of the stronghold.

01:26:29.451 --> 01:26:31.652
- Now's the time to attack.
- And this time,

01:26:31.654 --> 01:26:34.388
the element of surprise
will be on our side.

01:26:34.390 --> 01:26:36.490
- (Cheering)
- Alina: <i>None of you should go.</i>

01:26:38.826 --> 01:26:41.295
You don't understand him like I do.

01:26:41.297 --> 01:26:44.198
He's a beast only because
he's been treated like one.

01:26:44.200 --> 01:26:46.433
You've gone soft because
you're under his spell.

01:26:47.902 --> 01:26:49.937
No.

01:26:56.945 --> 01:26:59.313
I kept this for you.

01:27:02.817 --> 01:27:04.551
Hold on to it for me.

01:27:27.375 --> 01:27:28.842
(Growls)

01:27:31.012 --> 01:27:32.546
(growling)

01:27:38.987 --> 01:27:40.621
(roaring)

01:27:44.626 --> 01:27:46.960
- To the throne, men!
- <i>(Cheering)</i>

01:27:48.863 --> 01:27:50.964
To the throne, men!

01:28:26.934 --> 01:28:29.603
You invade my home...

01:28:33.374 --> 01:28:35.075
How dare you?!

01:28:35.077 --> 01:28:36.543
(Roaring)

01:28:41.082 --> 01:28:42.816
Destroy the intruders.

01:28:48.656 --> 01:28:49.856
Dracula!

01:29:01.669 --> 01:29:04.438
Alina:
<i>Stop! Stop fighting!</i>

01:29:13.581 --> 01:29:16.683
- You took away the only thing I have ever loved.
- You're incapable of love.

01:29:16.685 --> 01:29:18.719
All you know is death.

01:29:29.063 --> 01:29:31.365
Dracula!

01:29:31.367 --> 01:29:33.800
Let her go!

01:29:33.802 --> 01:29:36.403
She is not
to be harmed!

01:30:05.433 --> 01:30:07.501
Sweet blood of Cain.

01:30:14.809 --> 01:30:16.977
We're the cause
of all this death.

01:30:16.979 --> 01:30:20.814
I would tear the world apart for you.

01:30:28.055 --> 01:30:29.956
(Yells)

01:30:38.833 --> 01:30:40.834
Renfield.

01:30:40.836 --> 01:30:42.536
Why?

01:30:42.538 --> 01:30:45.939
Because you gave
her dominion over your heart

01:30:45.941 --> 01:30:48.175
and this land.

01:30:48.177 --> 01:30:51.578
<i>A mere concubine.</i>

01:30:51.580 --> 01:30:53.180
You defy the elders

01:30:53.182 --> 01:30:57.050
with your willfulness
and decadence.

01:30:57.052 --> 01:30:59.453
Your love is a disease

01:30:59.455 --> 01:31:01.154
that had to be
extinguished.

01:31:01.156 --> 01:31:05.192
I will bring this country
back to the glory

01:31:05.194 --> 01:31:08.161
- it once knew.
- No!

01:31:08.163 --> 01:31:11.198
I've already killed you once,
my princess.

01:31:42.663 --> 01:31:44.097
(Elizabeth screams)

01:31:46.901 --> 01:31:48.268
Esme, catch!

01:31:59.947 --> 01:32:02.616
(Gasps, groaning)

01:32:04.752 --> 01:32:06.753
Perhaps it's better
this way.

01:32:09.023 --> 01:32:11.124
No one should
live forever.

01:32:11.126 --> 01:32:13.093
Alina.

01:32:15.830 --> 01:32:18.265
Stay back!

01:32:18.267 --> 01:32:19.766
No.

01:32:27.608 --> 01:32:29.175
It's over.

01:32:31.078 --> 01:32:34.281
Alina...

01:32:34.283 --> 01:32:37.150
take me back
to the chamber.

01:32:58.940 --> 01:33:00.607
You can heal yourself.

01:33:00.609 --> 01:33:02.609
I know you can.

01:33:04.879 --> 01:33:07.080
Let me spend these
last moments with you.

01:33:11.285 --> 01:33:13.954
It's better than
a century alone.

01:33:38.846 --> 01:33:40.780
I'll be waiting for you.

01:34:00.835 --> 01:34:04.004
Narrator: <i>Burdened with the curse of a broken heart,</i>

01:34:04.006 --> 01:34:06.306
<i>Lucien vanished</i>
<i>into the wilderness</i>

01:34:06.308 --> 01:34:09.876
<i>just as his forefather</i>
<i>had so many eons ago.</i>

01:34:12.413 --> 01:34:15.715
<i>No one knows where he went</i>
<i>or if another descendant</i>

01:34:15.717 --> 01:34:18.785
<i>of Cain will appear</i>
<i>when the time is right.</i>

01:34:18.787 --> 01:34:21.254
<i>And so ends</i>
<i>the untold tale</i>

01:34:21.256 --> 01:34:23.657
<i>of the first crusade</i>
<i>of Dracula.</i>

01:34:23.659 --> 01:34:26.393
<i>Many slayers fought</i>
<i>to find him,</i>

01:34:26.395 --> 01:34:28.028
<i>including descendants</i>

01:34:28.030 --> 01:34:30.397
<i>of the great</i>
<i>Leonardo Van Helsing.</i>

01:34:30.399 --> 01:34:33.033
<i>The castle destroyed,</i>

01:34:33.035 --> 01:34:35.368
<i>all that is left in ruins,</i>

01:34:35.370 --> 01:34:37.237
<i>but Dracula still lives.</i>

01:34:37.239 --> 01:34:39.372
<i>I know this to be true,</i>

01:34:39.374 --> 01:34:44.177
<i>as I wait to reunite</i>
<i>with my one true love.</i>

01:34:46.781 --> 01:34:49.015
<i>Heroes die,</i>

01:34:49.017 --> 01:34:51.317
<i>death is eternal...</i>

01:34:53.020 --> 01:34:56.056
<i>but real love is forever.</i>

01:34:57.158 --> 01:34:59.159
