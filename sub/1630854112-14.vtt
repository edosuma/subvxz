we're fully dismantled.

Hen, let us know

09:39.638 --> 09:40.970

to remove that mixing wand.

09:41.064 --> 09:42.414
Okay.

09:42.565 --> 09:44.165
(Reyna moaning)

09:46.661 --> 09:48.494
All right. We're set.

09:48.589 --> 09:51.164
All right, Buck, you ready?
Slowly and carefully.

09:51.316 --> 09:54.651
Okay. One, two, and lift.

09:54.669 --> 09:57.012
(Reyna wails)

09:58.432 --> 10:00.581
Please tell me
she's going to live.

10:00.675 --> 10:03.751
She will. Probably with
a prosthetic arm.

10:03.829 --> 10:06.179
She gave me a bad review, and...

10:06.331 --> 10:08.164
now I feel like it's my fault.

10:08.257 --> 10:10.091
No, it's not your fault.

10:10.110 --> 10:13.260
It's not your fault.
I was pushing the numbers.

10:13.280 --> 10:15.280
I let the bosses get in my head.

10:15.431 --> 10:16.840
I'm sorry.

10:16.933 --> 10:18.007
Reyna, it's okay.

10:18.101 --> 10:21.010
No. You should be
supervisor, Laverne.

10:21.104 --> 10:23.179
Everyone looks up to you.

10:23.198 --> 10:25.106
You'll take care of them.

-Fight for them.
-Okay.

for the last... year.

14:39.028 --> 14:42.288
Ever since my fiancé
called off the wedding.

14:43.032 --> 14:46.718
I'm sorry.
That must've not been easy.

14:46.945 --> 14:47.886
It wasn't.

14:48.054 --> 14:49.721
I am not even remotely ready

14:49.872 --> 14:51.614

bring my dates here and...

-Let them down easy.
-Mm-hmm.

14:56.229 --> 14:57.620
I get that.

14:57.789 --> 14:59.639
And, plus, you wouldn't
want to break<i> tía's</i> heart.

14:59.791 --> 15:01.807

-you took me to La Fonda.
-Mm-hmm.

15:17.233 --> 15:19.751
I had the Milanesa de Pollo,

15:19.978 --> 15:23.479
-you had the Mole Poblano. Yeah.
-Mm-hmm.

15:23.572 --> 15:25.572
Um, you paid,
held the door for me,

15:25.667 --> 15:27.150
I got a little drunk. Uh...

15:27.243 --> 15:28.651
We had a lovely evening,

15:28.670 --> 15:31.203
and we talked and talked,
but ultimately we decided that

15:31.355 --> 15:33.172
we'd be better off friends.

19:41.330 --> 19:43.497
-Outstanding.
-Thanks, Cap.

19:43.516 --> 19:44.331
But maybe

19:44.350 --> 19:45.574
it's time to find the right

19:45.626 --> 19:47.226
work/life balance.

19:47.412 --> 19:48.928
Mm, feel like I have that.

19:49.080 --> 19:51.171
Me, Christopher,
we're a good team.

19:51.191 --> 19:52.190
And you're a great father.

19:52.341 --> 19:53.507
But there is more to life,

19:53.526 --> 19:54.934
and I think even
Christopher would agree.

19:55.028 --> 19:56.360
The sooner you realize that,

19:56.512 --> 19:58.070
the sooner you can
get back out there.

19:59.014 --> 20:00.105
(sighs)

20:00.258 --> 20:02.867
Okay, time to turn the tables.

20:03.094 --> 20:04.777
Let me have it.

20:04.929 --> 20:07.020
Oh... talk about
a lot to process.

20:07.114 --> 20:08.431
-Uh...
-I can take it.

20:08.524 --> 20:09.523
I feel like
I haven't had a chance

20:09.542 --> 20:12.376
to really, uh,
collect my thoughts,

20:12.603 --> 20:14.787
so let me go out there

20:14.956 --> 20:16.605
and-and-and do

20:16.699 --> 20:18.290
some collecting.

20:18.443 --> 20:19.884
I'll get back...
I'll get back to you.

20:20.111 --> 20:21.293

You're gonna get back to me...

20:21.446 --> 20:22.595
E-Eddie?

20:24.131 --> 20:25.372
Recruits, don those harnesses

20:25.466 --> 20:27.040
and get up there and construct
those main lines.

20:27.134 --> 20:29.710
I want you to check one another
for safety and security.

20:29.729 --> 20:31.620
This exercise is about trust.

20:31.714 --> 20:33.064
Trust in your equipment,

20:33.215 --> 20:34.381
trust in your training,

20:34.400 --> 20:35.566
and most of all,
trust in yourself.

20:35.718 --> 20:38.143
You four, up top.
Show me what you got.

20:38.238 --> 20:39.478
Let's move, move.

20:39.630 --> 20:41.647
Ledbetter, Novak,
get the lead out. Let's move it.

20:41.799 --> 20:45.134
Imagine you have a victim
down below in a ravine,

20:45.152 --> 20:47.319
or you have to make
an emergency extraction

20:47.472 --> 20:48.579
from an apartment or a tower.

20:48.806 --> 20:49.747
This is about speed,

20:49.898 --> 20:51.082
efficiency and, again, trust.

20:51.233 --> 20:53.567
You two, let's do it.

20:53.586 --> 20:58.238
Safety first, safety first.

23:25.146 --> 23:26.311
And the second.

23:26.464 --> 23:28.313
But I powered through,

24:48.729 --> 24:51.972
They're low, and-and you
marked me as "outstanding."

24:52.066 --> 24:53.565
Yes, considering that...

24:53.659 --> 24:56.994
Considering what? That I had
an accident on the job

24:57.145 --> 24:58.645
but I recovered?

24:58.664 --> 25:00.164
Buck, you died.

25:01.075 --> 25:02.741
Yeah. So, what,
now you're just gonna

25:02.893 --> 25:04.150

I don't think

25:08.174 --> 25:09.581
Okay? I'm a member of this team,

Y-You can't cut me any slack.

25:16.999 --> 25:18.407
You're right.

25:18.500 --> 25:19.575

25:19.668 --> 25:21.001

that you'd earned it,

antibiotics at the hospital,

29:26.414 --> 29:28.581

surgeon to repair

29:30.085 --> 29:31.176

Unclear, and not
for us to determine.

29:33.163 --> 29:36.523
I've already lost
a lot more than my arm, son.

29:38.185 --> 29:40.986
I was so afraid
I couldn't live up to you.

29:42.114 --> 29:44.031
And you were cheating?

29:46.118 --> 29:47.600
I was afraid, too.

29:47.620 --> 29:49.736
Didn't think they would
love me anymore.

29:49.789 --> 29:52.030

You went out there and won.

30:00.448 --> 30:02.040
Uh, yeah, that's gonna
be tricky right now.

30:02.209 --> 30:04.209
(shouting gets louder)

30:04.303 --> 30:06.553
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Easy, easy.

30:09.049 --> 30:11.216
Okay. All-all right.

30:11.310 --> 30:13.018
Sergeant, we got to move.
A little help?

30:15.706 --> 30:17.706
Ladies and gentlemen,

30:18.542 --> 30:22.060
...I don't know if what
this man did is illegal.

30:22.212 --> 30:24.062
But I do know this:

30:24.139 --> 30:26.306
that pursuant to section 148.2

30:26.325 --> 30:28.492
of the California
State Penal Code,

30:28.661 --> 30:29.901
it is a misdemeanor

30:30.054 --> 30:32.220
to willfully obstruct
emergency personnel

30:32.314 --> 30:36.083
from discharging
their official duties.

30:38.228 --> 30:40.838
Now, let me advise you.

30:41.065 --> 30:44.007
Do not obstruct.

30:47.404 --> 30:48.971
Hey, kid.

30:50.332 --> 30:53.166
You won this fair and square.

30:53.927 --> 30:56.728
Keep it. I was only
doing it for him.

31:11.095 --> 31:13.111
No surprises here.

31:13.263 --> 31:16.264
Outstanding in every aspect
of your performance.

31:16.283 --> 31:17.616
-(chuckles)
-To be completely honest,

31:17.692 --> 31:19.784
I could argue that you
outperformed me as captain

31:19.937 --> 31:21.694
when you held the position
earlier this year.

31:21.714 --> 31:24.214
Okay, Cap. We're not here
to make me blush.

31:24.366 --> 31:25.549
No, you carried this house

31:25.776 --> 31:28.610
on your back and kept up
with your medical studies.

31:28.629 --> 31:29.945
It's impressive.

31:29.963 --> 31:32.297
The irony...

31:32.391 --> 31:33.615
There's irony?

31:33.634 --> 31:35.333
...is that while you
were in medical school,

31:35.394 --> 31:37.377
none of your LAFD Continuing
Education hours were met.

31:37.396 --> 31:39.897
Your paramedic certification
is about to expire

31:40.048 --> 31:41.456
in ten days.

31:41.549 --> 31:43.308
Oh.

31:43.402 --> 31:45.551
But don't worry,
I got you an extension.

31:45.646 --> 31:50.240
Thanks. Again, Cap.

31:51.318 --> 31:52.576
Okay, I was completely
honest with you,

31:52.803 --> 31:54.819
now you be completely
honest with me.

31:54.972 --> 31:55.971
Go ahead, hit me.

31:56.807 --> 31:59.082
<i> ATHENA:</i>
<i> So, then, what did you say?</i>

31:59.234 --> 32:00.400
Well, I told him that I think

32:00.494 --> 32:01.734
his captain's truck
is very clean.

32:01.754 --> 32:03.812
Oh, you used that one again?

32:03.830 --> 32:05.571
I had to say something, Athena.

32:05.666 --> 32:07.482
I mean, he literally built

32:07.575 --> 32:09.259
this entire conversation
around honesty

32:09.411 --> 32:10.652
just so he could ambush me.

32:10.671 --> 32:13.079
The man craves feedback.

32:13.173 --> 32:14.823
Mm-hmm, that's my husband.

32:14.992 --> 32:16.658
(chuckles) Always
wants to do better,

32:16.793 --> 32:18.251
even when he's doing great.

32:18.270 --> 32:20.086
If he only knew he was perfect.

32:20.180 --> 32:22.105
(laughing):
Most of the time.

32:22.332 --> 32:23.774
Well, you know what they say.

32:24.001 --> 32:27.361
Perfect is the enemy of good.

32:28.096 --> 32:31.156
And why do we say that?

32:32.176 --> 32:33.784
This whole Nathaniel thing.

32:33.860 --> 32:36.511
Ever since Denny brought him
back into our lives,

32:36.530 --> 32:38.956
Karen and I feel like
we have to be perfect.

32:39.107 --> 32:41.941
Like we're putting on
a show all the time.

32:42.035 --> 32:43.351
Why-why do you think
I'm over here,

32:43.370 --> 32:46.037
trying to duplicate
my mom's jerk chicken?

32:46.190 --> 32:47.447
We're having him
over this weekend.

32:47.466 --> 32:51.218
You do realize that
he is not perfect, either.

32:52.620 --> 32:56.306
I don't know if this
makes me a bad person, but...

32:56.533 --> 32:58.642
I don't like having him around.

32:58.793 --> 33:00.051
Hmm.

33:00.145 --> 33:01.979
See? Terrible person.

33:02.130 --> 33:05.631
You just have to build
a little trust with him.

33:05.800 --> 33:07.876
-That's all.
-And then what?

33:07.894 --> 33:10.712
What happens
when we do something

33:10.805 --> 33:12.305
that Denny doesn't like?

33:12.399 --> 33:14.307
Is he gonna go
running to his father?

33:14.401 --> 33:16.885
That's doesn't sound like Denny.

33:16.903 --> 33:20.497
That sounds like
your anxiety talking.

33:22.242 --> 33:23.750
(sighs)

33:40.594 --> 33:41.910
There you are.

33:41.928 --> 33:43.520
Hey.

33:43.671 --> 33:44.763
What's up?

33:44.931 --> 33:47.507
Uh, Drill Master told me
you cut the fire drill.

33:47.675 --> 33:49.751
Well, there's already plenty
of that in the training.

33:49.844 --> 33:52.612
Switching it up is good,
I guess.

33:54.441 --> 33:56.867
Listen, I'm mostly

33:57.094 --> 33:58.610
going off instinct because

33:58.762 --> 33:59.944
I'm trying to cover for the fact

34:00.021 --> 34:01.496
that I don't know
what I'm doing.

34:03.433 --> 34:05.208
Kevin Lee.

34:06.194 --> 34:08.545
He was like a brother to me.

34:08.696 --> 34:12.107
We joined up together,
mostly because I led the charge.

34:12.200 --> 34:13.884
We were assigned
to separate houses,

34:14.111 --> 34:15.960
but we were at this
big structure fire

34:16.055 --> 34:18.055
together downtown.

34:19.283 --> 34:20.298
Next thing I knew,

34:20.450 --> 34:21.950
he was falling through the roof

34:21.968 --> 34:23.977
and I couldn't save him.

34:26.290 --> 34:28.190
I'm really sorry.

34:29.810 --> 34:32.694
But he saved two lives that day.

34:34.131 --> 34:37.574
Kevin's the reason
I became a firefighter.

34:38.243 --> 34:39.559
He's also the reason

34:39.636 --> 34:42.454
I've been afraid
to lead anyone into anything.

34:46.568 --> 34:47.809
(chuckles)

34:47.902 --> 34:49.068
Wha...

34:49.162 --> 34:51.379
Something funny about that?

34:52.740 --> 34:55.592
I think I figured out
why Cap sent me down here.

34:59.264 --> 35:01.323
Speaking of which,
you still haven't told me

35:01.325 --> 35:02.766
why you're still down here.

35:03.435 --> 35:06.561
Tell me about this
big save in Long Beach.

35:14.929 --> 35:16.762
I was driving with my parents

35:16.782 --> 35:19.324
when we saw the car
go off the pier.

35:20.360 --> 35:22.193
I didn't even
have time to think.

35:22.346 --> 35:23.787
I jumped in the water

35:23.938 --> 35:26.030
to save the people
inside that car.

35:26.125 --> 35:28.850
Nothing wrong with that.

35:29.611 --> 35:32.963
It was a father
and his two kids.

35:34.299 --> 35:35.781
I saved him,

35:35.801 --> 35:40.095
but I could only get to
one of the little ones in time.

35:44.551 --> 35:46.292
But what haunts me

35:46.311 --> 35:48.478
isn't the one that I lost.

35:50.149 --> 35:51.523
It's the one that I saved.

35:52.800 --> 35:57.654
That car didn't
go off the pier on accident.

35:59.049 --> 36:00.991
The father
drove it off the pier.

36:01.142 --> 36:03.660
He wanted to kill his kids.

36:06.723 --> 36:08.665
Listen, that's rough.

36:10.076 --> 36:11.501
But a situation like that,

36:11.653 --> 36:13.895
you got to hand it off.

36:13.988 --> 36:16.564
Focus on the task
in front of you.

36:16.583 --> 36:19.492
We're in the business
of saving lives,

36:19.511 --> 36:21.011
not judging them.

36:21.162 --> 36:23.513
Do you ever stop and think that

36:23.740 --> 36:26.975
some people's lives
just aren't worth saving?

36:29.671 --> 36:30.854
If you're thinking that,

36:31.081 --> 36:33.732
then you don't belong
on the rig.

36:35.585 --> 36:37.068
I know.

36:47.614 --> 36:50.373
It went great. You know?

36:50.600 --> 36:51.875
Uh, we went to La Fonda.

36:52.026 --> 36:54.953
Uh, she had
the Milanesa de Pollo,

36:55.047 --> 36:56.788
I had the Mo...

36:56.957 --> 36:58.289
um...

36:58.383 --> 37:02.627
Chile Verde,
and we talked for a while,

37:02.796 --> 37:05.538
but we agreed, you know, it's...

37:05.632 --> 37:08.058
We're better off as friends.

37:09.135 --> 37:12.787
She was... very nice.

37:12.806 --> 37:15.640
You're never going
to see her again, huh?

37:15.734 --> 37:16.882
(sighs) I'm sorry,<i> tía.</i>

37:16.902 --> 37:18.476
(sighs) I'm not ready.

37:18.570 --> 37:21.312
That's the point.
You're never ready.

37:21.465 --> 37:23.631
Do you think I was ready
when I met Paco?

37:23.725 --> 37:25.984
If I hadn't gone out
with the girls from work,

37:26.078 --> 37:27.135
it would have never happened.

37:27.153 --> 37:28.970
And only because they forced me,

37:28.989 --> 37:30.472
after six years

37:30.490 --> 37:32.490
trying to get over
my first husband.

37:32.567 --> 37:34.325
First?

37:34.402 --> 37:35.643
Wait...

37:35.812 --> 37:38.496
-you were married
before<i> tío</i> Paco?
-Mm-hmm.

37:38.648 --> 37:39.905
Two years.

37:39.925 --> 37:41.483
I would say
it was a train wreck,

37:41.651 --> 37:44.335
but that wouldn't
be nice to train wrecks.

37:44.471 --> 37:45.837
(laughs)

37:45.931 --> 37:47.264
That's crazy.

37:47.415 --> 37:49.683
Why has no one said
anything about this?

37:50.936 --> 37:51.993
<i> Abuela.</i>

37:52.086 --> 37:54.521
It's like he never existed.

37:55.423 --> 37:56.606
(exhales)

37:56.775 --> 37:59.517
Edmundo, I was just like you.

37:59.594 --> 38:02.837
I was making good money
as a paralegal,

38:02.930 --> 38:05.507
and I thought
my life was perfect.

38:05.600 --> 38:07.767
But it wasn't.

38:07.861 --> 38:11.103
I was getting set in my ways,

38:11.197 --> 38:14.532
and the longer you're alone,

38:14.626 --> 38:17.419
the easier it is.

38:18.204 --> 38:21.464
I don't want that for you.

38:25.695 --> 38:27.721
Me, either.

38:34.554 --> 38:36.871
(alarm chiming)

38:36.873 --> 38:38.130
Where's Mom?

38:38.150 --> 38:39.649
Oh, Mama's at the market.

38:39.801 --> 38:41.726
We ran out of powdered sugar,
and I need it for the desserts.

38:41.803 --> 38:43.486
He's gonna be here any second.

38:43.638 --> 38:46.214
Oh, it'll be fine. Hopefully,
he's not Mr. Punctual.

38:46.307 --> 38:48.766
-(doorbell rings)
-Oh, great.

38:48.827 --> 38:49.809
He's Mr. Early.

38:49.903 --> 38:51.736
You made Grammy's jerk chicken?

38:51.888 --> 38:53.997
Yeah. Why?

38:54.166 --> 38:56.074
Mama, he doesn't like spicy.

38:56.226 --> 38:58.001
Hey, hey, hey. Listen to me.

38:58.228 --> 39:00.395
It's gonna be fine.

39:00.488 --> 39:03.247
Can't you just make
frozen pizza or something?

39:03.342 --> 39:06.250
Even if I had one,
I wouldn't do that.

39:06.403 --> 39:08.494
We are not gonna put on
a show for this man.

39:08.513 --> 39:10.638
We're gonna do us.

39:11.575 --> 39:12.574
Go.

39:12.667 --> 39:13.666
Get the door,

39:13.685 --> 39:15.185
and I'll be right behind you.

40:24.923 --> 40:26.405
Might as well accept it.

40:26.499 --> 40:29.241
Can't be a firefighter
if you're afraid of heights.

40:29.261 --> 40:31.911
Doesn't mean
you can't help people.

40:31.930 --> 40:33.930
Doesn't even mean
you can't save lives.

40:34.081 --> 40:37.750
If I'd had a chance
to review your performance,

40:37.769 --> 40:39.510
I wouldn't have recommended
you for advancement.

40:39.587 --> 40:40.845
However,

40:40.939 --> 40:45.424
you are the only person
who beat the Kobayashi Maru.

40:45.518 --> 40:47.185
Uh, the baby drill.

40:47.337 --> 40:50.354
You held yourself together

40:50.431 --> 40:53.199
even while I was screaming
in your ear.

40:54.619 --> 40:56.286
I found a rubber doll.

Big whoop.

40:58.014 --> 40:59.271
No, you made a difference.

40:59.365 --> 41:02.775
Doesn't matter how small,
it still means something.

What's this?

41:05.188 --> 41:07.038
I know someone at Dispatch,
and believe me,

41:07.114 --> 41:08.948
they can use someone

41:08.967 --> 41:11.468

41:28.228 --> 41:30.228
You're good at this.

41:30.380 --> 41:31.546
You noticed he had
a fear of heights

41:31.639 --> 41:34.882
the first day you were here,
so you tested him.

41:34.976 --> 41:36.659
That's right.

41:36.811 --> 41:40.722
And I'm not finished yet,
Peer Instructor Panikkar.

41:40.740 --> 41:43.057
-What, you're gonna test me now?
-More of a performance review.

41:43.076 --> 41:45.484
You put Ledbetter
on that backboard

41:45.504 --> 41:46.836
almost singlehandedly.

41:47.063 --> 41:50.081
So much for not being able
to handle heavy equipment.

41:50.233 --> 41:52.250
You're hiding out
down here, Ravi.

41:52.344 --> 41:53.676
You're stuck on that rope,
just like Novak.

41:53.753 --> 41:56.179
But whatever it is
you think is holding you back,

41:56.406 --> 41:58.163
you can learn to let it go.

41:58.258 --> 42:01.351
You just got to hand it off
and get back out there.

Hey,
you're a great teacher, Chim.

42:44.454 --> 42:45.469
And you're a better leader

CHIMNEY:
No, no, no.

43:04.824 --> 43:07.325
Can't you just tell us what
you want us to do directly,

43:07.493 --> 43:10.161
instead of always
making a game out of it?
