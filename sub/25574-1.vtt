02:12.647 --> 02:14.747
Can't take you
any further son.

02:14.749 --> 02:16.383
Ah, no,
this is fine, thanks.

02:16.385 --> 02:17.453
How much do I owe you?

02:18.987 --> 02:20.422
Seventeen pounds, please.

02:22.425 --> 02:23.924
Islander?

02:23.926 --> 02:25.428
Yep, born and raised.

02:25.927 --> 02:27.593
Visiting your folks?

02:27.595 --> 02:29.363
Funeral, actually.

02:29.365 --> 02:30.499
Oh, sorry to hear that.

02:35.938 --> 02:38.841
Sorry, uh,
I'm a student.

03:42.404 --> 03:45.107
- Hi, Dad.
- Well, hurry up. The tide's coming in.

04:07.962 --> 04:09.898
I hope you've brought
some smart clothes with you

04:11.033 --> 04:13.403
- for the funeral.
- Of course.

04:18.140 --> 04:20.673
Mum said Megan fell
from the cliffs.

04:20.676 --> 04:23.676
Yes, terrible business.

04:23.678 --> 04:24.878
What was she doing
up there?

04:24.880 --> 04:27.181
I don't know, son.

04:27.183 --> 04:29.715
Messing about,
I should think.

04:29.717 --> 04:32.186
- Playing the fool.
- It just doesn't make much sense.

04:32.188 --> 04:35.621
Every kid born around here knows
how dangerous East Point is.

04:35.623 --> 04:39.094
Yes, well, some children just
don't listen to advice, do they?

04:41.096 --> 04:42.895
And don't go talking
to your mother about it, either.

04:42.897 --> 04:44.133
She's very upset.

05:06.921 --> 05:08.522
Bloody hippies!

05:08.524 --> 05:11.093
- Dickhead!
- Stay out of the sodding road!

06:17.560 --> 06:20.062
- Hello, darling.
- Oh, hi, Mum.

06:22.765 --> 06:24.030
Do you want me
to make you some food, love?

06:24.032 --> 06:26.066
Uh, no, thanks, Mum.
I'm really tired.

06:26.068 --> 06:28.037
I might just have
a lie down if you don't mind.

07:12.380 --> 07:13.916
Come on, you two.

08:04.133 --> 08:05.668
Buying any wood?

08:06.335 --> 08:07.370
Got magic in it.

09:05.327 --> 09:06.361
Good morning.

10:40.021 --> 10:41.287
Solomon had sinned.

10:41.289 --> 10:45.057
Solomon had turned
his back on God.

10:45.059 --> 10:47.359
And yet, God withheld
his hand of punishment

10:47.361 --> 10:49.097
during Solomon's lifetime.

10:50.598 --> 10:52.098
How come?

10:52.100 --> 10:55.271
Why wasn't the entire kingdom ripped
away from Solomon and his family?

10:56.605 --> 10:58.404
Because of David.

10:58.406 --> 11:00.941
As far as he was concerned,
there was no other relationship

11:00.943 --> 11:04.076
as critical as his relationship
with God.

11:04.078 --> 11:06.879
And once he realized he had
jeopardized that relationship,

11:06.881 --> 11:10.617
he struggled to put God
back in his life.

11:10.619 --> 11:12.952
Scripture tells us
that Solomon's heart

11:12.954 --> 11:15.855
was not fully devoted
to the Lord, his God,

11:15.857 --> 11:19.292
as the heart
of his father had been.

11:19.294 --> 11:22.229
<i>David's relationship with God
was protecting his son</i>

11:22.231 --> 11:26.202
<i>even when Solomon made a terrible
and disastrous decision.</i>

11:28.971 --> 11:30.037
And so, this morning's sermon

11:30.039 --> 11:32.272
is intended as an encouragement
to those of you

11:32.274 --> 11:35.407
who take your relationship
with God seriously.

11:35.409 --> 11:36.976
When you focused
your life on God,

11:36.978 --> 11:39.512
you have created
an inheritance of protection

11:39.514 --> 11:41.281
for your children.

11:41.283 --> 11:44.220
They may make foolish decisions
and pay a terrible price,

11:45.087 --> 11:46.887
but your faith
will show to them

11:46.889 --> 11:49.091
the worst effects
of their foolishness.

11:51.159 --> 11:53.225
It's also meant
as a challenge

11:53.227 --> 11:54.661
to those of you
who haven't realized

11:54.663 --> 11:57.099
the importance
of your relationship with God.

11:58.132 --> 12:00.066
You can give
no greater inheritance

12:00.068 --> 12:01.567
- to your offspring.
- What?

12:01.569 --> 12:03.936
- And the inheritance...
- Stop staring.

12:03.938 --> 12:05.241
We've been
through enough already.

12:08.276 --> 12:09.375
Which brings us sadly

12:09.377 --> 12:12.244
to the tragic story
this week

12:12.246 --> 12:15.215
of our own young
Megan Lancaster,

12:15.217 --> 12:19.185
who saw a deer that had
been injured at East Point.

12:19.187 --> 12:21.955
As was her nature, she ran
to help the stricken animal

12:21.957 --> 12:23.592
and in so doing,

12:24.525 --> 12:25.895
fell from the cliff.

12:28.362 --> 12:30.931
How sad so young a person
should lose her life

12:30.933 --> 12:33.302
in coming to the aid
of a lowly animal.

12:34.970 --> 12:37.403
And yet the difference
between a person and an animal

12:37.405 --> 12:38.939
is no greater
than the difference

12:38.941 --> 12:40.676
between divinity
and humanity.

12:42.010 --> 12:44.143
That is why it is so amazing

12:44.145 --> 12:47.180
the Divine Lord,
the highest form of life,

12:47.182 --> 12:51.216
knowingly and willingly
sacrificed himself

12:51.218 --> 12:53.420
for the sake
of a lower life form.

12:53.422 --> 12:55.689
We pray this week
for Megan's family,

12:55.691 --> 12:59.359
for John and Bea, her parents,

12:59.361 --> 13:02.063
that their sacrifice
might not be in vain.

13:15.677 --> 13:17.576
We shall all rise now

13:17.578 --> 13:21.681
to sing hymn number 237,

13:21.683 --> 13:24.450
<i>All Things Bright
and Beautiful.</i>

13:39.266 --> 13:40.499
What are you doing here?

13:40.501 --> 13:41.700
Why'd you have
to come here?

13:41.702 --> 13:43.570
It's a church.
I'm here for service.

13:43.572 --> 13:45.205
Yes, I know it is,
but I don't want you here

13:45.207 --> 13:46.339
- and I don't want...
- I'll do what I can...

13:46.341 --> 13:47.773
Listen to me!

13:47.775 --> 13:50.509
I don't want you here,
do you understand?

13:50.511 --> 13:51.710
Well, that's very...

13:51.712 --> 13:53.448
Just go home.

14:03.759 --> 14:05.193
Body of Christ.

14:44.265 --> 14:46.666
Sam? I thought it was you.

14:46.668 --> 14:49.502
Dr. Goodman,
how lovely to see you.

14:49.504 --> 14:52.338
The university term over already?
It can't be.

14:52.340 --> 14:54.541
Well, no, I just came back
for Megan's funeral.

14:54.543 --> 14:56.242
Oh, yes.

14:56.244 --> 14:58.478
Terrible news.
Very good of you to come.

14:58.480 --> 14:59.782
Oh, well, I...

15:00.615 --> 15:02.315
What exactly happened there?

15:02.317 --> 15:05.484
She fell. She fell
from the cliffs at East point.

15:05.486 --> 15:08.588
- But...
- I signed the death certificate myself.

15:08.590 --> 15:11.324
Horrible business.
Barely recognizable.

15:11.326 --> 15:12.492
I just...

15:12.494 --> 15:14.494
Enough, Sam,
let's not delve.

15:14.496 --> 15:17.464
The village has been
traumatized enough.

15:17.466 --> 15:21.133
And now tell me
how's university going?

15:21.135 --> 15:23.335
- Is everything all right?
- Mmm-hmm.

15:23.337 --> 15:26.174
Well, come on. Your mother's
gotta get dinner on.

15:29.577 --> 15:31.411
It was nice
seeing you again, Doctor.

15:31.413 --> 15:34.616
Me, too, Sam, albeit
in terrible circumstances.

16:52.693 --> 16:55.164
Dear, Lord,
we thank you this day...

17:04.638 --> 17:05.806
Everything all right, Rachel?

17:07.842 --> 17:09.178
Yes, Father.

17:09.810 --> 17:11.843
Good.

17:11.845 --> 17:13.679
Well, we really
should be getting home,

17:13.681 --> 17:15.816
so you can help your mother
prepare for the festival.

17:17.218 --> 17:19.253
We have much to give
thanks for this year.

17:21.422 --> 17:22.857
- Dad?
- Hmm?

17:25.960 --> 17:27.295
Never mind.

17:29.531 --> 17:32.631
Look, I know things have been
difficult since Daniel came back,

17:32.633 --> 17:34.870
but we really should be grateful
for his safe return.

17:37.772 --> 17:40.706
Megan. She was so young.

17:40.708 --> 17:43.211
She never got
to experience anything.

17:43.945 --> 17:46.314
I know, my darling.

17:47.649 --> 17:52.318
But some experiences
are overrated.

17:52.320 --> 17:55.655
I just mean that the Lord
had a higher purpose for her.

17:55.657 --> 17:57.259
That's why he took us
from her.

17:57.792 --> 17:58.961
I know.

18:00.661 --> 18:01.996
This was her home.

18:03.297 --> 18:04.465
It's your home, too.

18:05.266 --> 18:06.933
This island is your family.

18:06.935 --> 18:08.470
What more would you need?

18:10.572 --> 18:12.738
Beware thrill-seeking, Rachel.

18:12.740 --> 18:15.274
It's done your brother
no good.

18:15.276 --> 18:17.545
And I'm sure young Sam
will come back to us in time.

18:18.647 --> 18:20.916
You must not travel
down a destructive path.

18:23.450 --> 18:27.488
Has Daniel spoken to you
of his addiction?

18:27.956 --> 18:29.988
No.

18:29.990 --> 18:31.892
His path was not predetermined.

18:32.393 --> 18:33.659
He's ill.

18:33.661 --> 18:35.831
And he's made some terrible
decisions in his short life.

18:36.965 --> 18:38.867
I don't want you
to do the same.

18:49.878 --> 18:51.045
Come on.

19:36.757 --> 19:38.023
What?

19:38.025 --> 19:39.494
You know,

19:40.628 --> 19:42.698
I've missed you
since I've been away.

19:45.632 --> 19:49.371
You've always been
my best girl, Rach.

19:51.072 --> 19:53.673
Daniel.

19:53.675 --> 19:55.077
What are you doing?

19:59.848 --> 20:02.648
This has got to stop.

20:02.650 --> 20:05.353
We forgave what you did
before, Daniel.

20:05.853 --> 20:07.922
Don't push your luck.

20:09.690 --> 20:11.525
She's your sister.

20:14.129 --> 20:16.398
I'm sorry, mummy,
I can't help it.

20:23.071 --> 20:24.637
What the hell
was that about

20:24.639 --> 20:25.841
at church this morning?

20:27.742 --> 20:28.777
Well?

20:31.845 --> 20:34.647
Do you not realize that
your actions reflect on me?

20:34.649 --> 20:35.717
On this family?

20:36.184 --> 20:37.552
Well?

22:14.282 --> 22:15.617
Kite.

22:16.551 --> 22:17.886
Is this what you're looking for?

22:21.221 --> 22:22.656
Yeah.

22:24.124 --> 22:25.593
But there's more.

22:28.028 --> 22:29.698
She went that way.

22:38.672 --> 22:41.040
Right. I'm off
down to the pub.

22:41.042 --> 22:42.207
Have a nice time, love.

22:42.209 --> 22:44.776
- Are you coming?
- Uh, no, thanks, Dad.

22:44.778 --> 22:46.111
Come on.

22:46.113 --> 22:47.713
The fellas will think
I have a daughter

22:47.715 --> 22:49.115
instead of a son
if you don't come out.

22:49.117 --> 22:51.016
Leave him.
He's had a busy day.

22:51.018 --> 22:52.584
Couple of beers
will do him good.

22:52.586 --> 22:54.820
He doesn't want to.

22:54.822 --> 22:57.792
Besides, I want to catch up
on new stories about university.

22:58.892 --> 23:00.792
It's about time he grew up.

23:00.794 --> 23:04.330
It's just a bunch of old men, Dad.
It's boring.

23:04.332 --> 23:06.898
You need to get your head
out of the clouds, boy.

23:06.900 --> 23:08.667
Get involved in real life.

23:08.669 --> 23:10.304
I have a real life.

23:12.340 --> 23:13.707
It's not here.

23:15.877 --> 23:18.079
See you later. Don't wait up.

23:24.149 --> 23:24.852
Sorry, mum, I didn't mean...

23:26.254 --> 23:27.789
I know what you meant.

23:30.291 --> 23:33.662
So, how is university?

23:35.630 --> 23:37.032
It's brilliant.

23:56.016 --> 23:57.251
Kite.

23:58.719 --> 23:59.987
Kite, come on.

24:00.822 --> 24:02.023
It's caught.

24:06.828 --> 24:08.894
Run.

24:09.929 --> 24:11.967
- Is that all of it?
- Yeah, I think so.

24:12.900 --> 24:15.001
Thinking isn't good enough.

24:15.003 --> 24:16.234
We need to know for sure.

24:16.236 --> 24:19.105
Yeah, I don't know
because I wasn't there.

24:19.107 --> 24:21.072
But I think so, all right.

24:21.074 --> 24:23.009
Fine.

24:23.011 --> 24:25.211
Let's get out of here
before anyone sees us, yeah.

24:33.286 --> 24:35.189
Bad magic.

24:36.256 --> 24:37.958
Bad magic.

24:39.259 --> 24:40.828
Bad magic.

24:54.007 --> 24:55.940
There once was a man
from Nantucket,

24:55.942 --> 24:57.943
who had a dick so big
he could suck it.

24:57.945 --> 25:00.146
He looked at the glass,
he saw his own ass,

25:00.148 --> 25:01.847
and he broke his own neck
trying to fuck it.

25:21.436 --> 25:22.801
Yes, Father.

25:22.803 --> 25:24.369
I'll have a sherry, please.

25:24.371 --> 25:27.007
And a large brandy, I presume,
for the good doctor.

25:28.909 --> 25:31.211
Come now, Donald.
It'll do you good.

25:32.345 --> 25:34.348
And I thought
your area of expertise

25:36.450 --> 25:38.083
was the spiritual.

25:38.085 --> 25:42.021
"Quench not the spirit,
despise not the prophecies.

25:42.023 --> 25:44.458
Prove all things, hold fast
that which is good.

25:45.392 --> 25:47.895
Abstain from all forms of evil."

25:49.930 --> 25:52.031
Your taste for that
what was landed you back

25:52.033 --> 25:55.070
in the warm embrace of our island,
Goodman, don't forget that.

25:56.269 --> 25:59.206
And what a lucky fellow I was
that you saved me.

26:00.742 --> 26:03.344
Well, you can go back out
in the cold if you prefer.

26:04.478 --> 26:06.445
But that will be such a shame

26:06.447 --> 26:08.315
given all that
we've achieved together.

27:49.984 --> 27:52.419
I still don't know what she
was doing out there, Father.

27:52.919 --> 27:53.952
She knew.

27:53.954 --> 27:56.355
All the kids knew
not to go near those cliffs.

27:56.357 --> 27:59.124
Come now, my son. It does not
good trying to second guess

27:59.126 --> 28:01.894
the motivation of others
at times like this.

28:01.896 --> 28:05.930
Instead, be thankful that she's
in a far better place now.

28:05.932 --> 28:08.902
And keep faith
for fruitful times ahead.

28:29.290 --> 28:30.558
What time is it?

28:34.027 --> 28:35.426
It's nearly midnight.

28:35.428 --> 28:37.364
Shit. I've gotta get home.

28:38.932 --> 28:40.067
Let's go.

28:41.902 --> 28:43.103
Sam?

28:44.237 --> 28:45.405
Never mind.

28:46.207 --> 28:47.542
Let's go.

29:01.221 --> 29:02.389
Hello?

29:03.357 --> 29:04.592
Who's there?

29:08.262 --> 29:09.461
Pervert!

29:09.463 --> 29:11.230
Get in the car.
Come on.

29:11.232 --> 29:12.433
Get in the car.

29:24.711 --> 29:26.413
Do you feel he was watching
the whole time?

30:25.773 --> 30:28.609
Sam! Sam!

31:04.245 --> 31:05.612
What time do you call this?

31:11.518 --> 31:14.218
And what time
did you get home last night?

31:14.220 --> 31:16.790
I don't know.
At half twelve.

31:17.792 --> 31:19.494
This isn't my home.

31:21.495 --> 31:23.262
This is not acceptable, Sam.

31:23.264 --> 31:24.298
Uh, what?

31:25.166 --> 31:26.601
You know full well "what."

31:27.601 --> 31:29.801
I'm not an idiot, Sam.

31:29.803 --> 31:32.737
I can smell
the sex on you.

31:32.739 --> 31:35.142
You're not taking
my car out again.

31:36.177 --> 31:38.176
Ever.

31:38.178 --> 31:40.512
She's the pastor's daughter.

31:40.514 --> 31:42.347
You're irresponsible.

31:42.349 --> 31:44.616
And you're putting me in a...

31:44.618 --> 31:46.454
- A situation.
- All done.

31:46.821 --> 31:48.156
Well done, love.

31:48.788 --> 31:50.457
Let's get going.

31:51.792 --> 31:54.659
Oh, and go and see
your Nan on the mainland.

31:54.661 --> 31:57.096
She called last night
to say she's not feeling well.

31:57.098 --> 31:58.063
No, but I was gonna...

31:58.065 --> 32:00.365
She'd love to see you
whilst you're back.

32:00.367 --> 32:02.568
No argument, Sam.

32:02.570 --> 32:04.436
While you're back
under my roof,

32:04.438 --> 32:07.175
you do as I saw, understand?

32:08.641 --> 32:10.244
And your bike's in the garage.

32:40.740 --> 32:42.542
Shit, shit, no!

32:46.280 --> 32:47.315
Oh.

32:51.619 --> 32:52.687
Fuck!

32:54.554 --> 32:56.756
Oh, shit.

32:59.493 --> 33:00.794
God.

33:31.659 --> 33:32.793
Is Rachel in?

33:51.778 --> 33:54.580
Sam, wait.

33:54.582 --> 33:55.680
How's it going?

33:55.682 --> 33:57.683
Yeah, it's good.
Let's go. Come on.

33:57.685 --> 33:59.620
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah, it's good.

34:02.555 --> 34:05.258
Sam, let's go.
Hurry up.

34:53.706 --> 34:56.009
- So, um...
- Uh...

34:56.842 --> 34:58.943
Sorry. Sorry.

34:58.945 --> 35:01.448
- You first.
- No, you go.

35:02.749 --> 35:04.385
What did you want
to talk about?

35:05.686 --> 35:07.921
Daniel. He knows.

35:08.722 --> 35:10.957
- Knows what?
- About us.

35:12.760 --> 35:15.894
He's probably not gonna say
anything but I don't know.

35:15.896 --> 35:17.829
Since he came back,
he's different.

35:17.831 --> 35:20.899
Now he's trying to get
my dad on his side.

35:20.901 --> 35:23.971
I'm worried he might say something
to take the heat off him.

35:26.506 --> 35:28.707
My dad knows we were out
last night, too.

35:28.709 --> 35:29.844
What?

35:32.713 --> 35:34.849
Everything all right,
my lovelies?

35:36.749 --> 35:39.950
Now, what can I get you?

35:39.952 --> 35:42.387
Um, could I have
a cup of tea, please?

35:42.389 --> 35:43.657
Make that two.

35:48.561 --> 35:49.660
What are we gonna do?

35:49.662 --> 35:52.030
I wouldn't worry about it.

35:52.032 --> 35:54.765
Fucking hell, Sam,
you wouldn't worry about it?

35:54.767 --> 35:56.867
You haven't got
a fucking clue.

35:56.869 --> 35:58.672
Don't you remember
what it's like here?

35:59.673 --> 36:01.707
It's alright for you.

36:01.709 --> 36:03.108
I'm stuck
with the repercussions.

36:03.110 --> 36:04.575
You know,
you could have left, too.

36:04.577 --> 36:06.912
You got a place at uni.

36:06.914 --> 36:08.780
And who would pay for that?

36:08.782 --> 36:10.751
My mum's not
on my side, remember?

36:26.900 --> 36:28.432
I'm sorry.

36:28.434 --> 36:30.635
No, I am.

36:30.637 --> 36:32.039
I'm sorry you left me.

36:37.077 --> 36:39.443
So what are we gonna do, then?

36:39.445 --> 36:41.546
I've gotta go
and visit my Nan.

36:41.548 --> 36:44.649
Not that. About Daniel
and your dad?

36:44.651 --> 36:47.051
Well, yeah, um...

36:47.053 --> 36:50.421
Can we meet later
and talk about it, then?

36:50.423 --> 36:52.823
When? I'm helping
with the festival tonight.

36:52.825 --> 36:55.760
No.

36:55.762 --> 36:57.662
You're coming, right?

36:57.664 --> 37:00.966
I just can't stand the thought
of having to make idle chitchat

37:00.968 --> 37:03.568
with people I don't really like.

37:03.570 --> 37:06.140
Well, I'll be there.

37:10.043 --> 37:11.611
What about After?

37:13.713 --> 37:16.784
Fine. But you better figure out
what we're gonna do.

37:32.198 --> 37:34.001
To what do I owe
this displeasure?

37:42.608 --> 37:45.577
Was it just me
or was that tea really sugary?

37:45.579 --> 37:47.847
- Little bit.
- Really sweet.

37:48.749 --> 37:49.881
I'd better go.

37:49.883 --> 37:51.950
- Yeah, me too.
- I'll see you tonight?

37:51.952 --> 37:54.522
Try and swing by if I don't get
any better offers.

37:55.122 --> 37:56.524
Shut up.

38:33.760 --> 38:35.827
What?

38:35.829 --> 38:37.262
Bad magic.

38:37.264 --> 38:39.930
- Are you...
- I don't know what you're talking about.

38:39.932 --> 38:41.534
Please, let me go, I...

39:09.563 --> 39:11.229
Whoa!

39:11.231 --> 39:14.064
- Where's the fire, Sam?
- Hi.

39:14.066 --> 39:15.700
Sorry, Father.

39:15.702 --> 39:17.202
The woodsman...

39:17.204 --> 39:19.671
Gave me a start, that's all.

39:19.673 --> 39:22.943
I wish you youngsters wouldn't
insist on calling him that.

39:23.644 --> 39:25.142
He's a vagrant.

39:25.144 --> 39:26.878
No place in this community.

39:26.880 --> 39:28.879
Sorry, Father.

39:28.881 --> 39:30.684
A man should learn his place.

39:32.019 --> 39:33.287
What did he say to you?

39:34.988 --> 39:36.620
What?

39:36.622 --> 39:38.055
I didn't say he said anything,

39:38.057 --> 39:41.660
he just gave me
a start, that's all.

39:41.662 --> 39:44.298
- Sorry, I...
- Will you be joining us for the feast this evening?

39:46.566 --> 39:47.865
Will Daniel be there?

39:47.867 --> 39:50.068
Yes, why?

39:50.070 --> 39:51.736
I didn't realize
you two were friends.

39:51.738 --> 39:53.874
Oh, no, we're not.
I just wondered.

39:55.842 --> 39:57.274
How's he doing now?

39:57.276 --> 39:59.577
Well, Daniel is Daniel.

39:59.579 --> 40:01.680
I'm afraid
we'll never change him.

40:01.682 --> 40:04.084
Some children
are just born inherently...

40:04.952 --> 40:06.253
challenging.

40:07.119 --> 40:08.720
So, where were you running to?

40:08.722 --> 40:10.754
Oh, I was just gonna check
on my Nan.

40:10.756 --> 40:12.923
Mum and dad are on the mainland
getting the shopping in.

40:12.925 --> 40:16.361
Ah, yes, I dropped in
on her myself the other week.

40:16.363 --> 40:20.100
She really is a fearsomely
independent and dogmatic woman.

40:21.200 --> 40:22.802
Even since the stroke.

40:24.637 --> 40:26.271
Well, I should be getting along.

40:26.273 --> 40:28.305
And sorry again.

40:28.307 --> 40:30.240
Don't worry, Sam.

40:30.242 --> 40:32.313
Do give her my fondest regards,
won't you?

40:35.048 --> 40:36.183
Oh, and Sam?

40:39.885 --> 40:41.255
Stay away from my daughter.

40:42.021 --> 40:43.090
You understand.

40:45.825 --> 40:47.992
You may have given up
on this island as your home,

40:47.994 --> 40:49.228
but she's still one of us.

40:50.197 --> 40:51.865
You won't ever change that.

40:56.035 --> 40:57.171
We'll see you tonight.

41:31.171 --> 41:32.640
Great.

43:55.881 --> 43:57.316
Fucking hippies!

44:57.110 --> 44:58.278
Meredith.

47:16.383 --> 47:17.651
Nan?

47:46.512 --> 47:47.780
Nan?

49:13.633 --> 49:15.202
Nan?

49:22.842 --> 49:24.276
Nan?

49:54.840 --> 49:57.307
Nan. Uh...

49:57.309 --> 50:01.211
I didn't know that you could
move that fast, um...

50:01.213 --> 50:05.716
Do you wanna come downstairs
and I'll get the kettle on.

50:05.718 --> 50:08.221
And... And did you know
you left the front door open?

51:23.595 --> 51:24.697
No!

52:00.900 --> 52:02.001
Oi!

54:00.052 --> 54:01.421
Damn you, Dad!

54:07.427 --> 54:08.595
Let me out!

59:40.059 --> 59:42.526
- Mum?
- Um, no, Dad, it's me.

59:42.528 --> 59:45.294
Sam, where are you?

59:45.296 --> 59:47.363
We've been trying to call you
for an hour.

59:47.365 --> 59:50.800
Sorry, I dropped
my phone down the toilet.

59:50.802 --> 59:53.504
Um, it's a long story.
Where are you?

59:53.506 --> 59:57.140
We missed the bloody tides
due to your mother's doodling.

59:57.142 --> 59:59.843
I'll have to wait till
the morning to get back.

59:59.845 --> 01:00:02.281
Look, I...
I don't wanna worry you, but...

01:00:03.448 --> 01:00:04.483
<i>I donno where Nana is.</i>

01:00:05.383 --> 01:00:07.219
Don't worry. She's fine.

01:00:08.086 --> 01:00:09.053
Meredith called earlier

01:00:09.055 --> 01:00:10.954
to say she was gonna pick her up
for the feast.

01:00:10.956 --> 01:00:12.925
- What?
- She's over there now.

01:00:13.526 --> 01:00:14.761
Oh.

01:00:15.160 --> 01:00:16.294
Okay. Good.

01:00:18.564 --> 01:00:19.866
Are you all right, Sam?

01:00:20.965 --> 01:00:23.432
Yeah. Sort of it.

01:00:23.434 --> 01:00:25.535
- It's been a wierd day.
- <i>Well, look...</i>

01:00:25.537 --> 01:00:28.204
Apologize to Father David
for us, will you?

01:00:28.206 --> 01:00:29.374
Explain what happened.

01:00:30.809 --> 01:00:32.475
We'll be back early tomorrow,
all right?

01:00:32.477 --> 01:00:34.977
- Yes. Fine.
- <i>Good.</i>

01:00:34.979 --> 01:00:36.914
Now you better get home
to get ready.

01:00:36.916 --> 01:00:39.051
Okay. Yeah, I will. Bye.

01:00:43.289 --> 01:00:44.423
He'll be all right.

01:00:45.423 --> 01:00:46.423
I know. I...

01:00:46.425 --> 01:00:49.294
He manages to get by University
without you.

01:01:11.150 --> 01:01:12.218
Daniel!

01:03:17.343 --> 01:03:18.975
Evening, young man.

01:03:18.977 --> 01:03:20.242
What can I get you?

01:03:20.244 --> 01:03:23.181
Um, could I just have
an orange juice, please?

01:03:33.992 --> 01:03:36.161
There you are, love.
Have a good night.

01:03:42.166 --> 01:03:44.200
So he just turned around
and walked away.

01:03:46.405 --> 01:03:48.604
Um, excuse me, Meredith.

01:03:48.606 --> 01:03:51.677
Would you excuse me
for a moment, please ladies.

01:03:53.211 --> 01:03:54.512
I was just wondering if...

01:03:55.514 --> 01:03:58.080
- Rachel...
- Yeah, she's not.

01:03:58.082 --> 01:04:00.019
And you won't be seeing her
again. Do you understand?

01:04:04.155 --> 01:04:06.358
I know what you did
to my little girl.

01:04:07.392 --> 01:04:09.128
You filthy animal.

01:04:11.630 --> 01:04:13.463
Is my nan here?

01:04:13.465 --> 01:04:16.399
No. She wasn't feeling well.

01:04:16.401 --> 01:04:18.267
She's back at her house.

01:04:18.269 --> 01:04:20.605
Thank you for looking after her.

01:05:14.593 --> 01:05:17.294
Well, thank you
everybody, for coming out this evening.

01:05:17.296 --> 01:05:20.763
I'm sure you'll all agree it's
been a most wonderful celebration.

01:05:20.765 --> 01:05:22.298
Here, here.

01:05:22.300 --> 01:05:25.501
I'm sure you'll all like to join me
in thanking the ladies of the village

01:05:25.503 --> 01:05:28.073
for preparing God's bounteous
feast for us.

01:05:28.606 --> 01:05:29.707
Here, here.

01:05:39.550 --> 01:05:42.353
Now let us now our heads
and give thanks to the creator.

01:05:48.459 --> 01:05:53.365
Dear Lord, we offer you thanks for this magnificent
feast that you bestow upon us this season.

01:05:54.499 --> 01:05:56.267
We thank you for
brightening our world

01:05:57.802 --> 01:06:01.604
and we thank you for the life
of young Megan Lancester

01:06:01.606 --> 01:06:03.742
and the joy
she brought to us all.

01:06:05.477 --> 01:06:07.413
- Amen.
- Amen.

01:06:08.914 --> 01:06:12.151
And now, go in love
to serve the Lord.

01:07:06.637 --> 01:07:07.805
Do you know what he did?

01:07:13.611 --> 01:07:14.646
What they did?

01:07:33.398 --> 01:07:34.767
You don't deserve my help.

01:08:19.810 --> 01:08:20.879
Fuck!

01:10:57.936 --> 01:10:59.405
Help! Help!

01:12:35.901 --> 01:12:37.903
Get outta here.
Bad magic.

01:12:38.836 --> 01:12:39.905
Run!

01:12:58.188 --> 01:12:59.288
Go!

01:13:23.281 --> 01:13:25.114
Shut the fuck up...

01:13:25.116 --> 01:13:26.783
No.

01:13:26.785 --> 01:13:28.220
Shut the fuck up.

01:14:20.905 --> 01:14:23.108
Excuse me, but what the fuck
is going on?

01:14:29.947 --> 01:14:31.349
Who were those people?

01:14:32.817 --> 01:14:34.386
Who the fuck are you people?

01:14:35.420 --> 01:14:37.289
Your priest, yeah...

01:14:38.857 --> 01:14:39.890
He's a murderer.

01:14:41.226 --> 01:14:44.630
- Father David?
- But... But...

01:15:05.950 --> 01:15:07.184
Wonder what he wants.

01:15:11.121 --> 01:15:14.423
- Good morning.
- You're up early, Father.

01:15:14.425 --> 01:15:16.093
Yes, well, I need to
speak with Alan...

01:15:17.128 --> 01:15:18.263
...on a serious matter.

01:15:19.830 --> 01:15:20.898
You go inside, love.

01:15:21.732 --> 01:15:22.800
I'll bring the shopping in.

01:15:29.206 --> 01:15:30.241
Do you...

01:15:31.976 --> 01:15:35.046
Do you know what your son did
to my daughter?

01:15:36.747 --> 01:15:40.184
Yes, Father.
But I'm sure it was consensual.

01:15:47.224 --> 01:15:49.393
- Here.
- Thanks.

01:16:00.437 --> 01:16:01.472
What's your name?

01:16:04.308 --> 01:16:07.778
- Sparrow.
- No. Your real name.

01:16:11.116 --> 01:16:12.184
Lucy.

01:16:13.418 --> 01:16:14.786
Lucy Omens.

01:16:17.321 --> 01:16:18.355
Sam.

01:16:22.927 --> 01:16:25.093
I... I don't know

01:16:25.095 --> 01:16:26.964
- What...
- Jim tried to warn us.

01:16:28.366 --> 01:16:30.999
I just thought it was
a madman with a grudge.

01:16:31.001 --> 01:16:32.870
- Who?
- Jim.

01:16:33.972 --> 01:16:35.139
The woodsman.

01:16:36.140 --> 01:16:37.940
It's his real name.

01:16:37.942 --> 01:16:40.842
What... He... He tried to
warn you about what?

01:16:40.844 --> 01:16:43.147
- Your lot.
- What do you mean my lot?

01:16:43.881 --> 01:16:45.080
Villagers.

01:16:45.082 --> 01:16:48.316
- Islanders?
- No, we're all islanders.

01:16:48.318 --> 01:16:50.285
But your lot, the villagers,
you're weird.

01:16:50.287 --> 01:16:52.387
We live in a bunch of
dirty hippies living in...

01:16:52.389 --> 01:16:54.892
Hey, remember that time
I saved your life.

01:16:56.460 --> 01:16:58.896
You might wanna be grateful
to this dirty hippy.

01:17:08.473 --> 01:17:10.175
Jim, the woodsman,

01:17:11.509 --> 01:17:15.046
<i>told us about the cult.
But we just thought he was mad.</i>

01:17:20.884 --> 01:17:25.887
<i>One of the original dirty hippies who
came here in the 60s was my dad.</i>

01:17:25.889 --> 01:17:27.825
Just did one too many
types of acid.

01:17:42.206 --> 01:17:43.240
He was one of you.

01:17:44.142 --> 01:17:45.876
Yeah. To start off with.

01:17:48.245 --> 01:17:49.280
He's gay.

01:18:19.143 --> 01:18:22.280
My family's been here for generations.
We'd have known about it.

01:18:54.077 --> 01:18:56.447
- Your son is impure.
- What about your son?

01:18:57.682 --> 01:19:00.285
You know not to speak
of Daniel's impulses.

01:19:00.550 --> 01:19:01.984
He's ill.

01:19:01.986 --> 01:19:05.020
Sam knew for well what he was doing
when he violated my daughter.

01:19:05.022 --> 01:19:07.025
Was it worse
than what Daniel did to Megan?

01:19:09.059 --> 01:19:11.394
Rachel and Sam have been
seeing each other for years.

01:19:11.396 --> 01:19:13.932
I... I assumed you knew.

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:19.970
That's why I agreed to let him go
to University on the mainland.

01:19:23.241 --> 01:19:25.708
You know what
we're going to have to do.

01:19:25.710 --> 01:19:29.110
- Don't you, Alan?
- Now, you listen here.

01:19:29.112 --> 01:19:31.948
Sam goes back to the mainland
tomorrow after the funeral.

01:19:31.950 --> 01:19:34.019
As far as I'm concerned,
that's the end of it.

01:19:34.619 --> 01:19:35.920
You hear me?

01:20:18.196 --> 01:20:19.597
They killed that girl too,
you know?

01:20:22.299 --> 01:20:24.166
Megan?

01:20:24.168 --> 01:20:25.970
The girl they dumped
over the cliffs.

01:20:29.339 --> 01:20:30.573
What?

01:20:30.575 --> 01:20:32.376
She fell from the cliffs.

01:20:33.510 --> 01:20:35.276
The doctor told me himself.

01:20:35.278 --> 01:20:37.245
He saw the body,
signed the death certificate.

01:20:37.247 --> 01:20:40.516
Wake up, Sam.

01:20:40.518 --> 01:20:44.255
They killed her and dumped her body off
the cliff to look like an accident.

01:20:45.423 --> 01:20:46.523
I've got proof.

01:20:48.291 --> 01:20:49.326
It's a cult.

01:21:07.311 --> 01:21:09.414
People have been
going missing for years.

01:21:10.615 --> 01:21:12.217
It's nothing we can do.

01:21:13.351 --> 01:21:15.251
Police aren't interested in us.

01:21:15.253 --> 01:21:19.521
We're just transients.

01:21:19.523 --> 01:21:23.260
They tell us that they've probably gone
back to the mainland, got proper jobs.

01:21:24.695 --> 01:21:25.796
When I...

01:21:26.798 --> 01:21:28.767
When I found that girl
at east point,

01:21:30.701 --> 01:21:32.604
I knew there was no use
telling anyone...

01:21:33.737 --> 01:21:36.140
...that they'd probably
cover it up.

01:21:38.076 --> 01:21:41.312
I was right. They did.

01:21:43.447 --> 01:21:46.250
Then Kite found something
and when we went looking...

01:21:47.085 --> 01:21:48.153
...he found that.

01:21:51.656 --> 01:21:52.823
And then we started
to follow him.

01:21:56.259 --> 01:21:57.327
<i>Priest.</i>

01:21:58.495 --> 01:22:01.297
Once the world was pure...

01:22:01.299 --> 01:22:03.468
Created as it was,
a simple place.

01:22:04.701 --> 01:22:07.502
But humans have perverted it...

01:22:07.504 --> 01:22:09.706
...scarred it
with their impurity.

01:22:11.174 --> 01:22:13.577
We will keep the island pure.

01:22:14.378 --> 01:22:17.445
We will keep it pure.

01:22:17.447 --> 01:22:19.648
Nature came before man.

01:22:19.650 --> 01:22:22.351
And we will return to nature.

01:22:22.353 --> 01:22:24.453
Banish the sickness.

01:22:24.455 --> 01:22:27.525
But we too are wicked.
Each of us.

01:22:28.793 --> 01:22:31.226
We must cleanse ourselves...

01:22:31.228 --> 01:22:33.263
...with the blood of the impure.

01:22:34.866 --> 01:22:38.900
I alone can cleanse you
of this blood.

01:22:38.902 --> 01:22:42.206
Never shall you take blood
without my blessing.

01:22:44.709 --> 01:22:46.876
On the appointed day,

01:22:46.878 --> 01:22:49.645
we shall take an impure spirit,

01:22:49.647 --> 01:22:52.417
and cleanse ourselves
of wickedness.

01:22:52.750 --> 01:22:54.119
Yeah.

01:22:54.719 --> 01:22:55.753
Then we realized...

01:22:58.321 --> 01:22:59.356
They're all in on it.

01:23:34.558 --> 01:23:35.927
And now Kite's gone
missing, too.

01:23:36.960 --> 01:23:38.793
We have to go
to the police with this.

01:23:38.795 --> 01:23:41.231
I'm going when
the tide drops tonight.

01:23:42.500 --> 01:23:44.266
- You need to come, too.
- I... I...

01:23:44.268 --> 01:23:46.437
They won't
believe me alone, Sam.

01:23:49.973 --> 01:23:51.275
Please.

01:23:59.217 --> 01:24:00.351
Thanks.

01:24:10.228 --> 01:24:12.397
Can't you control this animal?

01:24:13.763 --> 01:24:17.399
It seems we both have a problem
controlling our sons.

01:24:17.401 --> 01:24:21.837
But my son didn't rape and kill
an innocent child.

01:24:24.709 --> 01:24:25.777
Silence!

01:24:56.006 --> 01:24:57.905
Get yourself together, man.

01:24:57.907 --> 01:24:59.276
We've got work to do.

01:25:05.383 --> 01:25:06.550
Get up!

01:25:11.921 --> 01:25:14.692
You do realize what needs
to be done. Don't you, Alan?

01:25:16.460 --> 01:25:18.459
Sam...

01:25:18.461 --> 01:25:20.330
He's with the fragrance
at the farm.

01:25:22.066 --> 01:25:24.635
What do you suggest
we do with him?

01:25:45.755 --> 01:25:47.388
How much further is it?

01:25:47.390 --> 01:25:50.559
Try not to broadcast our
location at the top of your voice, maybe.

01:25:50.561 --> 01:25:52.360
Sorry.

01:25:52.362 --> 01:25:55.330
How much further is it?

01:25:55.332 --> 01:25:58.803
Head round the cliffs and make our
way along the rocks to the causeway.

01:25:59.603 --> 01:26:01.470
We'll make the tide.

01:26:01.472 --> 01:26:02.807
But we need to pick up the pace.

01:28:33.924 --> 01:28:35.059
Shit.

01:28:35.893 --> 01:28:37.028
That can't be good.

01:28:38.528 --> 01:28:39.629
Come on.

01:29:06.089 --> 01:29:08.226
What's going on, John.
Where are you going?

01:29:09.593 --> 01:29:11.260
Not now, Bea.

01:29:11.262 --> 01:29:12.929
- I have to go.
- Where?

01:29:35.753 --> 01:29:39.924
Sam! Sam!
Please, I'm up here.

01:29:43.794 --> 01:29:47.164
- Rachel?
- No, Sam. Wait.

01:31:08.277 --> 01:31:12.047
I'll talk to Alan.
Get him to find out, okay?

01:31:12.049 --> 01:31:14.685
- Thank you.
- It'll be all right, I promise.

01:31:29.133 --> 01:31:30.367
Bad magic.

01:31:31.067 --> 01:31:32.369
Bad magic.

01:31:33.903 --> 01:31:35.839
Who did this to you, poor soul?

01:31:37.073 --> 01:31:39.007
Bad magic.

01:31:39.009 --> 01:31:41.212
- They killed your girl.
- What?

01:31:43.013 --> 01:31:45.883
- What did you say?
- Fox.

01:31:48.986 --> 01:31:50.220
Fox hunter.

01:31:51.120 --> 01:31:52.255
I see it...

01:31:53.022 --> 01:31:54.157
Bad magic.

01:31:56.927 --> 01:31:58.228
Bad magic.

01:32:00.129 --> 01:32:02.098
Please, don't. Fox.

01:32:04.168 --> 01:32:05.335
Don't you...

01:36:54.023 --> 01:36:55.124
Go left.

01:39:48.264 --> 01:39:52.266
- Dad?
- Why?

01:39:52.268 --> 01:39:55.636
Why couldn't you just do
as you were told?

01:39:55.638 --> 01:39:57.805
- And none of this would have happened.
- None of what?

01:39:57.807 --> 01:40:00.175
- This.
- David is a murderer.

01:40:00.177 --> 01:40:01.644
Not a murderer.

01:40:02.545 --> 01:40:03.646
A leader.

01:40:04.347 --> 01:40:06.183
A leader of men.

01:40:06.515 --> 01:40:07.718
A savior.

01:40:08.451 --> 01:40:10.251
Our savior.

01:40:10.253 --> 01:40:12.488
Don't tell me
you knew about this, Dad.

01:40:14.624 --> 01:40:16.793
I don't want any part of this.

01:40:18.327 --> 01:40:20.630
Sam, please.

01:40:22.264 --> 01:40:24.267
Sam, please join us.

01:41:00.804 --> 01:41:01.872
Good.

01:41:03.839 --> 01:41:05.308
Now, we can begin.

01:41:34.903 --> 01:41:36.005
Brothers,

01:41:37.273 --> 01:41:39.409
we have been defiled.

01:41:40.809 --> 01:41:41.878
This one...

01:41:43.580 --> 01:41:47.815
He is from our place
but he is not one of us.

01:41:47.817 --> 01:41:51.552
He has turned his back
on purity and Godliness...

01:41:51.554 --> 01:41:55.492
...in favor of a lustful
and destructive existence.

01:41:56.992 --> 01:42:00.962
He alone has brought filth
into our sacred garden.

01:42:00.964 --> 01:42:02.696
And worse...

01:42:02.698 --> 01:42:05.768
He has corrupted
one of our own sweet children.

01:42:08.004 --> 01:42:09.439
Forgive us, Lord.

01:42:10.072 --> 01:42:11.972
My own daughter...

01:42:11.974 --> 01:42:14.309
...debased by an unbeliever.

01:42:14.311 --> 01:42:17.578
Stop. Stop. Don't you see
what he did to her?

01:42:17.580 --> 01:42:18.782
Silence!

01:42:19.581 --> 01:42:21.050
We must purify ourselves.

01:42:21.718 --> 01:42:23.318
Our island.

01:42:23.320 --> 01:42:25.421
With the sacrifice of his blood.

01:42:27.991 --> 01:42:29.293
Brothers...

01:42:29.959 --> 01:42:31.827
Am I your savior?

01:42:33.095 --> 01:42:34.997
Am I your shepherd?

01:42:37.067 --> 01:42:39.400
Am I your father?

01:42:39.402 --> 01:42:40.568
Yes.

01:42:40.570 --> 01:42:44.540
Then let me show you the depth
of my commitment to you.

01:42:44.941 --> 01:42:46.543
My devotion...

01:42:49.845 --> 01:42:51.380
She has been marked.

01:42:52.648 --> 01:42:54.916
We must purify ourselves...

01:42:54.918 --> 01:42:57.454
...with the blood
of these carnal beasts.

01:42:57.853 --> 01:42:58.921
Help me.

01:43:47.036 --> 01:43:48.071
Fuck you.

01:43:48.972 --> 01:43:50.072
You're sick.

01:43:55.478 --> 01:43:56.713
Sick like Daniel.

01:43:57.513 --> 01:43:59.180
Is this why you killed her?

01:43:59.182 --> 01:44:00.617
Is this why you killed Megan?

01:44:01.049 --> 01:44:02.816
How does she know?

01:44:02.818 --> 01:44:04.787
- You fool!
- What?

01:44:06.022 --> 01:44:08.655
- What did she say?
- Now, wait, John.

01:44:08.657 --> 01:44:10.826
- I can explain.
- You!

01:44:12.528 --> 01:44:14.928
- You killed my little girl.
- Now, John, wait. Let's not...

01:44:14.930 --> 01:44:16.098
- You bastard.
- Shut up.

01:44:17.500 --> 01:44:18.602
You...

01:44:19.902 --> 01:44:22.770
What are you doing?
You have no place here.

01:44:22.772 --> 01:44:24.640
Who are you to tell us
what to do?

01:44:26.776 --> 01:44:28.445
Killed our little girl, John.

01:44:29.912 --> 01:44:31.846
For what?

01:44:31.848 --> 01:44:35.149
Women have no place
on this part of the island.

01:44:35.151 --> 01:44:36.818
- It is sacred.
- Good.

01:44:36.820 --> 01:44:38.752
- Why would we want it.
- Right.

01:44:38.754 --> 01:44:40.856
That's enough of this.
You stupid bitch.

01:44:43.793 --> 01:44:45.793
- Now, look here...
- Wait.

01:44:45.795 --> 01:44:47.794
Stop this.
Take them to the police.

01:44:47.796 --> 01:44:49.031
They need to know.

01:44:50.467 --> 01:44:52.900
Stop. Not like this. Please.

01:44:52.902 --> 01:44:54.137
- No.
- Brothers...

01:44:54.970 --> 01:44:56.039
Brothers...

01:45:37.613 --> 01:45:38.647
Sam...

01:45:41.550 --> 01:45:42.619
Sam...

01:45:45.088 --> 01:45:46.156
Sweetheart...

01:45:47.857 --> 01:45:48.892
Come on.

01:45:49.992 --> 01:45:51.093
Let's get you to bed.

01:45:56.031 --> 01:45:57.601
You should've gone
to the police.

01:45:58.300 --> 01:46:00.001
Oh no, darling.

01:46:00.003 --> 01:46:02.072
There's no need to get
anyone else involved.

01:46:03.106 --> 01:46:05.140
We islanders handle
our own problems.

01:46:07.943 --> 01:46:08.978
Come on.

01:46:36.238 --> 01:46:37.640
Say goodnight to your father.

01:48:25.714 --> 01:48:27.748
You shouldn't have...

01:48:27.750 --> 01:48:31.819
Sam, we'll have no more of that.

01:48:31.821 --> 01:48:34.256
You have to put this behind you
if you're going to get better.

01:48:36.392 --> 01:48:37.994
Now get some sleep.

01:48:43.700 --> 01:48:44.934
I love you, Sam.

01:50:03.478 --> 01:50:05.080
He's upstairs.

01:50:31.102 --> 01:50:36.102
