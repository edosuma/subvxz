WEBVTT

00:04.212 --> 00:07.915
The Monks have been with
us from the beginning.

00:09.543 --> 00:13.513
They shepherded humanity
through its formative years,

00:13.802 --> 00:16.841
gently guiding and encouraging,

00:17.676 --> 00:21.919
like a parent clapping their
hands at a baby's first steps.

00:23.704 --> 00:26.287
They have been instrumental
in all the advances

00:26.336 --> 00:28.418
of culture and technology.

00:29.818 --> 00:34.380
They watched proudly as man
invented the light bulb,

00:35.122 --> 00:36.645
the telephone

00:36.887 --> 00:38.490
and the internet.

00:39.536 --> 00:44.090
They were even there to welcome
the first men on the moon.

00:44.279 --> 00:46.812
<i>It's one small step for man,</i>

00:47.239 --> 00:49.693
<i>one giant leap for mankind.</i>

00:49.872 --> 00:52.396
And they have defended us too.

00:52.567 --> 00:56.255
Who can forget the time the
Monks defeated the Daleks,

00:56.412 --> 00:57.865
the Cybermen,

00:57.913 --> 00:59.623
the Weeping Angels?

00:59.950 --> 01:05.379
Two species, sharing a history as
happily as they share a planet,

01:05.653 --> 01:10.693
humanity and the Monks are a
blissful and perfect partnership.

01:10.896 --> 01:12.576
How lucky Earth is

01:12.779 --> 01:17.834
to have an ally as powerful
and tender as the Monks,

01:18.123 --> 01:23.146
that asks for nothing in return for
their benevolence but obedience.

01:31.281 --> 01:34.390
Go! Go! Go! Get down! On your knees!

01:34.446 --> 01:35.570
Hands on your heads!

01:35.649 --> 01:37.625
Get down! On your knees!

01:37.808 --> 01:38.883
Get down!

01:39.069 --> 01:40.709
Search the room!

01:49.619 --> 01:51.290
- Jane Bishop.
- That's me.

01:51.457 --> 01:54.947
You are charged with the
manufacture and possession

01:55.031 --> 01:58.190
of propaganda intended to
undermine the True History.

01:58.272 --> 02:01.951
This is in contravention of the
Memory Crimes Act of 1975.

02:02.093 --> 02:03.353
1975?

02:03.720 --> 02:05.673
The Monks have only
been here a few months!

02:05.721 --> 02:07.983
Therefore I sentence you to
ten years in a labour camp.

02:08.036 --> 02:08.824
Take her away.

02:08.872 --> 02:12.093
- Come on!
- Be a good boy for Mummy!

02:13.735 --> 02:16.160
The Monks have only
been here a few months!

02:16.352 --> 02:18.774
Fight back! It's all lies!

02:19.079 --> 02:20.086
Get in!

02:20.150 --> 02:22.535
- You know it's all lies!
- In there.

02:25.030 --> 02:27.780
Right, nothing to see, move along!

02:50.746 --> 02:53.465
So, relax, do as you're told.

02:53.864 --> 02:57.339
Your future is taken care of.

04:23.674 --> 04:25.198
Hello, Mum.

04:28.568 --> 04:29.904
The Monks...

04:33.521 --> 04:35.920
<i>The Monks have only been
here for six months.</i>

04:37.365 --> 04:39.857
<i>I can't remember how I escaped, Mum.</i>

04:40.169 --> 04:42.049
<i>I asked for their help and then...</i>

04:42.593 --> 04:44.357
<i>And then there's nothing.</i>

04:45.255 --> 04:47.670
<i>And then I woke up and
the Monks were here,</i>

04:47.760 --> 04:49.435
<i>and they'd always been here.</i>

04:49.552 --> 04:50.912
Come with me!

04:50.960 --> 04:54.146
<i>Everything they told us,
all that we believe now,</i>

04:54.294 --> 04:55.568
<i>is a lie.</i>

04:58.553 --> 05:02.600
<i>But I don't understand it, because
no-one's saying anything.</i>

05:03.316 --> 05:07.592
<i>It's like... like they've
been brainwashed.</i>

05:07.834 --> 05:10.255
With those who would do them harm

05:10.433 --> 05:13.756
by implementing a swift
and painless death.

05:16.464 --> 05:18.951
Praise be the justice of the Monks.

05:19.084 --> 05:21.553
I travelled with a man called the Doctor

05:21.683 --> 05:23.082
and his friend called Nardole,

05:23.153 --> 05:25.443
and I did this to save him.

05:25.646 --> 05:27.521
I'm trying to stay strong without them

05:27.576 --> 05:30.084
but, every day, it's harder to
remember what's real any more.

05:30.243 --> 05:34.142
If you suspect a colleague, a
neighbour or a family member

05:34.198 --> 05:35.396
of being a memory criminal...

05:35.443 --> 05:37.505
And I know how it looks, Mum,

05:37.678 --> 05:40.192
with all the stuff that he's
been saying on the telly,

05:40.318 --> 05:44.810
but it's all right, because
I know he has a plan.

05:45.833 --> 05:49.451
And one day soon, he's going
to come back and save us all.

05:50.357 --> 05:51.412
One day...

06:13.247 --> 06:16.045
What are you doing?! It's me, Nardie!

06:16.100 --> 06:19.155
No... Wait. Shut up. Tell me
something. That first time,

06:19.203 --> 06:21.626
with the Heather creature chasing
us, where did we run away to?

06:21.673 --> 06:24.608
- Australia.
- What noise should spaceship doors make?

06:24.733 --> 06:26.553
Shuck-shuck! Obviously.

06:29.508 --> 06:30.975
Oh, God!

06:32.952 --> 06:34.218
It happened.

06:34.533 --> 06:35.686
I knew it.

06:35.771 --> 06:37.374
It all really happened.

06:38.108 --> 06:39.194
Ow!

06:39.280 --> 06:41.692
- Where have you been?!
- That hurt me, that really hurt me!

06:41.693 --> 06:42.599
I needed you!

06:42.647 --> 06:45.780
Well, I got contaminated by that
bacteria in the lab, didn't I?

06:45.828 --> 06:49.132
I was laid up for six weeks. If
I was human, I would have died.

06:49.253 --> 06:51.124
Right now, you'd be talking to...

06:51.421 --> 06:53.732
Come to think of it, who
were you talking to?

06:53.827 --> 06:54.827
Um...

06:55.613 --> 06:56.757
My...

06:56.893 --> 06:58.858
Um... my mum.

06:59.780 --> 07:01.692
I thought your mum...

07:01.811 --> 07:03.171
died...

07:03.655 --> 07:04.965
You know, when you were...

07:05.209 --> 07:06.353
little.

07:06.425 --> 07:09.100
I made up a version of her.

07:10.326 --> 07:11.975
Yeah, I talk to her all the time.

07:12.183 --> 07:13.462
Oh...

07:13.823 --> 07:15.647
Well, that's not that weird.

07:15.811 --> 07:17.730
I used to have an imaginary friend.

07:17.827 --> 07:19.585
Until he left me for someone else.

07:19.659 --> 07:21.593
I know, charming!

07:22.085 --> 07:25.968
They're doing something to us. The
Monks. I can't think straight.

07:26.225 --> 07:28.365
It's like they're saying
they've been here for ever,

07:28.421 --> 07:30.265
and... I know they haven't,

07:30.493 --> 07:33.569
but part of me is starting
to think that it's real.

07:33.773 --> 07:36.850
Every day, I have to remind
myself that everything that you,

07:36.921 --> 07:39.554
me and the Doctor did actually happened,

07:39.772 --> 07:41.335
and it wasn't just a dream.

07:42.069 --> 07:43.444
Why do it?

07:43.804 --> 07:45.305
That's what I don't get.

07:45.811 --> 07:47.968
They invade somewhere, take control.

07:48.171 --> 07:50.460
Why go to the trouble
of changing the past?

07:50.533 --> 07:52.092
However bad a situation is,

07:52.140 --> 07:53.866
if people think that's
how it's always been,

07:53.970 --> 07:56.689
they'll put up with it.
That's 90% of the job done.

07:56.944 --> 08:00.154
Wait, you said you were
ill for six weeks.

08:00.202 --> 08:02.468
- Mmm.
- What have you been doing since then?

08:02.608 --> 08:03.995
Looking for the Doctor.

08:04.085 --> 08:05.780
Have you found him?

08:06.327 --> 08:08.022
Well, let's just say...

08:10.004 --> 08:12.124
- Yes, yes, yes, I found him!
- Ha!

08:12.327 --> 08:13.499
So...

08:13.695 --> 08:17.331
All anyone's seen of the
Doctor in the last six months

08:17.419 --> 08:20.921
- are those broadcasts he does.
- He's faking it, I'm positive.

08:21.225 --> 08:24.171
He hasn't joined the Monks.
He's being held prisoner.

08:24.256 --> 08:25.872
He's just biding his time, waiting.

08:25.999 --> 08:28.616
The thing is, the Monks have
got some kind of scrambler,

08:28.664 --> 08:30.749
so no-one can trace the broadcasts.

08:30.913 --> 08:34.832
Lucky, then, that I have got this!

08:34.960 --> 08:38.712
It traces the source of the signal
and gives a map coordinate.

08:38.796 --> 08:41.171
Cool! Where'd you get it?

08:41.366 --> 08:42.631
Found it in the TARDIS.

08:42.732 --> 08:43.972
Yeah, it was in one of the drawers

08:44.019 --> 08:46.280
with some old takeaway
menus and 50 Danish krone.

08:46.420 --> 08:48.929
Anyway, this is them.

08:49.038 --> 08:50.045
So he's at sea?

08:50.093 --> 08:51.890
- Mm-hm.
- Yeah.

08:51.997 --> 08:55.186
Yeah. The Monks have got him on
one of the old prison boats.

08:55.249 --> 08:56.334
Hulks, they used call them.

08:56.382 --> 08:58.569
- So, how do we get to him?
- Every six weeks,

08:58.643 --> 09:00.202
all their food and fuel and stuff

09:00.266 --> 09:02.225
gets taken to them by a supply boat.

09:02.343 --> 09:04.905
The next delivery is in two days' time,

09:05.073 --> 09:06.436
off the coast of Scotland.

09:06.727 --> 09:08.246
That's our chance!

09:10.085 --> 09:11.710
Yeah, that really has to stop.

09:13.960 --> 09:15.507
<i>It's happening, Mum.</i>

09:15.655 --> 09:17.022
<i>I knew it would!</i>

09:17.095 --> 09:20.429
<i>So, Nardole has made contact with
the captain of the supply boat</i>

09:20.480 --> 09:22.702
<i>that runs to and from the prison ship</i>

09:22.770 --> 09:24.522
<i>where the Doctor's being held.</i>

09:25.295 --> 09:28.037
<i>His son is serving ten
years in a labour camp</i>

09:28.100 --> 09:30.382
<i>for possession of a box of comics,</i>

09:30.890 --> 09:32.858
<i>so he's no fan of the Monks.</i>

09:34.185 --> 09:36.647
<i>He'll get us on board the prison ship.</i>

09:50.486 --> 09:52.455
<i>Security is really tight, obviously,</i>

09:52.533 --> 09:54.916
<i>but Nardole says there's not been
much in the way of resistance</i>

09:54.963 --> 09:56.000
<i>since the Monks took over,</i>

09:56.047 --> 09:58.619
<i>so they're more worried about
the Doctor getting out</i>

09:58.870 --> 10:00.630
<i>than anyone getting in.</i>

10:12.462 --> 10:14.157
<i>But what we don't want is for them</i>

10:14.222 --> 10:16.657
<i>to do a spot-check on
our identity papers.</i>

10:17.079 --> 10:19.462
Papers! Spot check.

10:19.626 --> 10:20.758
<i>Nardole doesn't have any,</i>

10:20.805 --> 10:23.430
<i>and I'm down as
university kitchen staff.</i>

10:41.387 --> 10:42.559
It's them!

11:34.377 --> 11:35.658
All right, what are you waiting for?

11:35.705 --> 11:38.111
We need to get this stuff
on board. Chop chop.

11:38.424 --> 11:40.405
- Come on! Come on!
- Come on!

11:54.942 --> 11:57.542
<i>After that, we're on our own.</i>

12:10.413 --> 12:13.417
Over the years, I have encountered
innumerable civilisations,

12:13.533 --> 12:16.212
but never one as
benevolent as the Monks.

12:16.300 --> 12:18.253
Their grace and humility...

12:18.333 --> 12:22.402
No, their grace and philanthropy
is matched only by their...

12:22.533 --> 12:24.050
Careful.

12:37.105 --> 12:38.152
Doctor?

12:41.745 --> 12:43.133
Doctor, it's me.

12:45.120 --> 12:46.573
Guards!

12:48.799 --> 12:50.831
What are you doing here?

12:51.065 --> 12:53.214
What does it look like?
We've come to save you.

12:53.268 --> 12:54.328
This is your doing, isn't it?

12:54.375 --> 12:56.650
You shouldn't be here. I'll
have to talk to the Monks now.

12:56.697 --> 12:58.316
- Doctor...
- Stop. Don't. Don't move.

12:58.364 --> 12:59.278
They will kill you.

12:59.350 --> 13:00.870
Stay where you are.

13:03.909 --> 13:05.426
Epsilon. Fire.

13:05.675 --> 13:06.971
Jupiter. Lily.

13:09.429 --> 13:11.369
The Monks are on their way.

13:11.987 --> 13:13.925
When they get here, let
me do the talking.

13:14.760 --> 13:16.245
Wait, what was that?

13:16.740 --> 13:19.557
Did you actually just
call them, you nutter?

13:19.948 --> 13:21.673
You deserve an explanation.

13:25.479 --> 13:27.447
Human society is...

13:28.955 --> 13:30.181
stagnating.

13:31.511 --> 13:33.228
You've stopped moving forward.

13:34.291 --> 13:35.841
In fact, you're regressing.

13:35.955 --> 13:38.400
- This isn't exactly much better.
- It's safer.

13:38.510 --> 13:40.978
Not so much for the people
the Monks are killing.

13:41.038 --> 13:42.056
The Romans killed people

13:42.104 --> 13:47.166
and saved billions more
from disease, war, famine

13:48.156 --> 13:49.281
and barbarism.

13:50.311 --> 13:51.549
No, wait.

13:53.451 --> 13:54.871
What about free will?

13:56.931 --> 13:59.486
You believe in free will.
Your whole thing is...

13:59.534 --> 14:02.581
You made me write a 3,000-word
essay on free will.

14:02.744 --> 14:04.243
Yes, well, I mean,

14:04.291 --> 14:06.564
you had free will, and look
at what you did with it!

14:06.632 --> 14:08.939
Worse than that, you had history.

14:09.077 --> 14:10.931
History was saying to you,

14:10.979 --> 14:14.018
"Look, I've got some examples of
fascism here for you to look at!

14:14.385 --> 14:16.272
No? Fundamentalism? No?

14:16.330 --> 14:18.502
Oh, ok, you carry on."

14:18.992 --> 14:20.131
I had to stop you,

14:20.179 --> 14:23.459
or at least not stand in the way
of someone else who wanted to,

14:23.499 --> 14:25.451
because the guns were getting bigger,

14:25.517 --> 14:26.457
the stakes were getting higher,

14:26.505 --> 14:29.088
and any minute now it was going
to be goodnight, Vienna.

14:29.136 --> 14:30.849
By the way, you never
delivered that essay, anyway.

14:30.896 --> 14:33.462
Because the world was
invaded by zombie Monks!

14:33.510 --> 14:35.110
And whose fault was that?

14:37.051 --> 14:39.291
Huh? I didn't ask for my sight back.

14:39.424 --> 14:42.512
No, you took it upon
yourself to ignore me,

14:42.572 --> 14:44.689
to do what you thought was best.

14:45.314 --> 14:48.408
All I can say is that we are
lucky it was a benevolent race

14:48.455 --> 14:50.291
like the Monks, not the Daleks.

14:50.556 --> 14:52.549
Yes, I know the Monks are ruthless,

14:52.586 --> 14:54.725
I get that. Yes, they play with history

14:54.773 --> 14:57.213
and I'm not exactly thrilled about that,

14:57.293 --> 15:00.533
but they bring peace and order.

15:02.745 --> 15:03.994
Ok.

15:04.892 --> 15:06.412
Yeah, yeah, I get it.

15:06.517 --> 15:10.321
It's like that time we discovered
that huge fish creature

15:10.369 --> 15:12.222
in the Seine in Paris.

15:17.712 --> 15:19.775
That was a coded message.

15:20.793 --> 15:22.978
The big fish creature
was under the Thames.

15:23.903 --> 15:27.449
If I'd played along, she'd have
known that I was tricking you.

15:28.439 --> 15:29.439
Guns down.

15:33.275 --> 15:34.341
I'm sorry, Bill.

15:34.389 --> 15:36.028
I just... I just...

15:36.494 --> 15:38.255
I really wanted to make you see.

15:44.240 --> 15:45.513
This...

15:47.333 --> 15:48.773
This is real.

15:50.633 --> 15:51.915
You...

15:52.040 --> 15:53.300
You're actually...

15:53.933 --> 15:55.413
You're actually doing this.

15:58.913 --> 16:02.188
Do you have any idea

16:02.336 --> 16:04.563
how hard the
past few months have been?

16:06.333 --> 16:08.933
How hard it's been to
hold onto to the truth?

16:10.219 --> 16:14.040
It would have been so
easy to just give in

16:14.493 --> 16:16.290
and believe their lies.

16:17.196 --> 16:18.393
But I didn't.

16:20.794 --> 16:23.981
I fought against it.

16:24.093 --> 16:25.373
For you!

16:25.833 --> 16:27.759
For when you came back.

16:28.453 --> 16:30.753
And now you're saying
you've joined them?

16:32.788 --> 16:34.528
You're helping them?

16:45.913 --> 16:47.444
Bill, put the gun down.

16:47.517 --> 16:49.197
I'm serious, Doctor.

16:50.991 --> 16:52.912
We'll think of something else.

16:53.753 --> 16:57.053
But you better tell me now.

16:58.193 --> 17:01.124
Because if you help the Monks,

17:01.389 --> 17:03.272
then nothing will ever stop them.

17:03.506 --> 17:05.444
They'll be here for ever.

17:06.657 --> 17:09.358
It's not a trick, it's not a
plan. I have joined the Monks.

17:10.113 --> 17:11.663
Whatever it takes,

17:11.833 --> 17:14.155
I'm going to save you from yourselves.

17:55.284 --> 17:56.714
Good girl!

18:02.693 --> 18:04.200
Regeneration a little bit too much?

18:04.261 --> 18:05.621
No, I thought it was a nice touch.

18:05.676 --> 18:08.552
"Too much" was Richard asking
for our identity papers.

18:08.600 --> 18:10.599
I couldn't resist it. Your face.

18:11.113 --> 18:12.792
Er, hello?

18:13.685 --> 18:15.712
Could somebody tell me
what the hell is going on?

18:15.794 --> 18:16.911
You did it.

18:17.000 --> 18:19.286
You did it!

18:20.676 --> 18:22.809
The Monks are using some kind of...

18:23.215 --> 18:24.473
you know, something,

18:24.645 --> 18:26.059
to control the population.

18:26.193 --> 18:28.712
They must be, otherwise they
wouldn't have been able to

18:28.879 --> 18:30.676
hold on to power for this long.

18:30.777 --> 18:32.872
Now, they don't trust
me yet, not completely,

18:32.973 --> 18:35.185
and I had to just check that you
weren't under the influence

18:35.232 --> 18:37.340
- and testing me.
- So you...

18:37.513 --> 18:39.245
You... you haven't turned?

18:39.293 --> 18:41.073
You're not working for them?

18:43.111 --> 18:45.390
No, of course not!

18:45.454 --> 18:47.752
I've spent the last six months planning,

18:47.857 --> 18:50.354
and also recruiting all these chaps.

18:50.736 --> 18:53.993
Deprogramming them one by one,

18:54.041 --> 18:55.533
talking some sense into them.

18:55.581 --> 18:58.229
And there's loads of them, I
could do with a Strepsil!

18:58.633 --> 18:59.877
But I shot you.

18:59.946 --> 19:01.865
Yes, well, that was the plan, you see?

19:02.015 --> 19:05.057
Everyone exchanged
their ammo for blanks.

19:05.233 --> 19:07.494
- Ahem.
- Did you forget, Dave?

19:07.791 --> 19:08.940
You forgot?

19:09.666 --> 19:12.221
Well, that would have really
blown the plan, wouldn't it?

19:12.377 --> 19:13.791
But you called the Monks.

19:13.842 --> 19:15.158
I called the kitchen.

19:15.221 --> 19:16.900
Oh, could you pop down
and explain it to them?

19:16.947 --> 19:19.330
They're going to be really confused.

19:22.294 --> 19:23.724
And you were in on this too?

19:23.772 --> 19:25.468
Oh! It was partly his idea.

19:25.633 --> 19:27.450
Oh, my... God.

19:28.223 --> 19:31.662
- I'm going to beat the sh...
- No! No!

19:31.953 --> 19:33.458
Oh, come on, come on,

19:33.514 --> 19:36.271
we've got the band back together again!

19:36.615 --> 19:39.661
Now, lovely as it is
to have you on board,

19:39.771 --> 19:41.312
literally and metaphorically,

19:41.404 --> 19:42.825
we're going to need some help.

19:42.971 --> 19:44.570
So, who are we going to get?

19:44.673 --> 19:47.673
The only person I know
almost as smart as me.

19:49.817 --> 19:50.935
Oh...

19:52.313 --> 19:53.661
I see.

19:54.540 --> 19:55.646
Blimey.

19:55.897 --> 19:57.573
Has it really come to that?

20:04.679 --> 20:06.312
<i>Mum, it's me.</i>

20:06.585 --> 20:08.046
<i>We're coming back.</i>

20:17.973 --> 20:22.285
<i>We could have snuck back in, but
the Doctor being the Doctor...</i>

20:48.175 --> 20:50.487
<i>By the time we got back
to the university,</i>

20:50.759 --> 20:52.848
<i>the Monks were waiting for us...</i>

20:53.261 --> 20:54.741
<i>of course.</i>

20:59.514 --> 21:01.881
<i>We weren't headed to his office, though.</i>

21:07.141 --> 21:10.909
<i>Even so, the Doctor was
nervous, Mum. I could tell.</i>

21:11.079 --> 21:13.141
<i>He had to do this, he said.</i>

21:13.469 --> 21:15.665
<i>He had to open the vault.</i>

21:16.125 --> 21:18.465
Move into the containment field, please.

21:51.749 --> 21:52.975
But it's...

21:53.936 --> 21:55.446
It's just a woman.

21:56.702 --> 21:58.725
The way you and Nardole
have been carrying on,

21:58.812 --> 22:00.637
I thought you had a monster
in here, or something!

22:00.684 --> 22:01.684
I do.

22:02.716 --> 22:03.991
Missy...

22:04.296 --> 22:05.312
Bill.

22:05.376 --> 22:06.577
Bill, Missy,

22:06.625 --> 22:08.788
the other Last of the Time Lords.

22:12.063 --> 22:13.157
Wait a sec.

22:13.402 --> 22:15.361
Why have you got a woman
locked in a vault?

22:15.603 --> 22:17.966
Because even I think that's weird,
and I've been attacked by a puddle.

22:18.013 --> 22:21.131
She's going cold turkey from being bad.

22:21.452 --> 22:24.204
I want to ask if you've had any
dealings with the Monks before.

22:24.252 --> 22:26.743
Of course! I've had adventures too.

22:27.251 --> 22:29.931
My whole life doesn't revolve
around you, you know?

22:30.056 --> 22:32.091
- Did you defeat them?
- I did.

22:32.813 --> 22:33.938
How?

22:37.486 --> 22:39.189
I've got some requests.

22:39.423 --> 22:41.907
I want some new books, some toys,

22:42.030 --> 22:43.704
like a particle accelerator,

22:43.837 --> 22:46.446
a 3-D printer and a pony.

22:46.624 --> 22:50.672
I don't think that you really
grasp what's going on here.

22:51.636 --> 22:55.025
Nice people generally don't
haggle over the fate of a planet.

22:55.142 --> 22:57.937
I once built a gun out of leaves.

22:58.196 --> 23:00.915
Do you think I couldn't get
through a door if I wanted to?

23:02.161 --> 23:05.454
I'm here, all right? I'm
engaging with the process.

23:06.501 --> 23:10.431
OK, yeah, we can get
those things for you.

23:10.736 --> 23:12.220
C'est super!

23:14.673 --> 23:18.573
So, what have you got so far?

23:19.946 --> 23:22.196
They hold on to power by
targeting the part of the brain

23:22.267 --> 23:26.540
specifically to do with memory
and perception, correct? Right?

23:26.698 --> 23:28.884
Getting warm. Fingers tingling.

23:29.415 --> 23:33.806
But they target it with what
exactly? How do they sustain it?

23:33.923 --> 23:38.462
How do their lies infiltrate
the brains of billions?

23:38.593 --> 23:40.775
Is it some kind of
airborne psychoactive?

23:40.878 --> 23:42.751
No, no, that's very cold, very cold.

23:42.800 --> 23:46.181
Something that's constantly
being fed to the populace,

23:46.361 --> 23:48.829
constantly consolidating its
hold. Is it in the water?

23:48.970 --> 23:52.548
God, no. It's freezing,
freezing, absolutely freezing.

23:52.633 --> 23:55.259
Couldn't be colder, very,
very, chilly, so, so chilly.

23:55.315 --> 23:56.355
Oh, come on.

23:57.500 --> 24:01.126
I'm bored! You haven't been
to see me in six months.

24:01.228 --> 24:02.759
No-one has!

24:02.939 --> 24:04.779
Not even that bald bloke
who looks like an egg!

24:04.833 --> 24:06.952
You left her alone in
here for six months?!

24:07.048 --> 24:08.392
I was in prison for six months!

24:08.501 --> 24:10.352
Start at the beginning.

24:10.423 --> 24:12.407
How do they get a foothold on a planet?

24:12.548 --> 24:14.345
Some idiot asks for their help.

24:14.470 --> 24:16.032
Not just any idiot.

24:16.095 --> 24:19.095
It has to be a properly
consenting human mind.

24:19.273 --> 24:23.384
A pure request, one without
agenda or ulterior motive.

24:27.353 --> 24:28.829
It's them.

24:29.513 --> 24:32.196
That person creates a psychic link,

24:32.383 --> 24:34.843
which forms an anchor that
keeps the Monks in power.

24:34.891 --> 24:35.954
They're the lynchpin!

24:36.019 --> 24:37.498
Scalding! Ow!

24:37.593 --> 24:40.376
But the brainwaves of one person
wouldn't be powerful enough

24:40.602 --> 24:42.472
to contain an entire planet...

24:42.602 --> 24:43.753
The statues!

24:45.473 --> 24:48.848
As soon as they got here,
the Monks put up statues!

24:49.238 --> 24:52.504
In every town square, in every
park and every playground!

24:52.598 --> 24:55.505
You're on fire, you're literally
on fire you're so caliente.

24:55.613 --> 24:56.752
That's Spanish for "hot".

24:56.871 --> 24:58.949
The statues are transmitters!

24:59.105 --> 25:02.145
They boost the signal and beam
it out all around the world!

25:02.246 --> 25:04.012
Boom! You've exploded.

25:04.660 --> 25:07.185
Now, all you have to do is find
whoever opened the door to

25:07.277 --> 25:09.824
- the Monks in the first place.
- Say I already have.

25:09.872 --> 25:11.751
Oh, well, then you're sorted.

25:12.207 --> 25:16.567
Just kill them. That weakens
the Monks' grip on the world.

25:20.576 --> 25:23.335
No, no, no, that can't be right.

25:23.633 --> 25:26.196
There are planets that the Monks
have ruled for thousands of years.

25:26.243 --> 25:28.550
It's passed on through the bloodline.

25:28.833 --> 25:32.087
Usually the lynchpin goes on to
lead a normal life, have their

25:32.135 --> 25:35.334
own family, and the link is passed
down through the generations.

25:35.407 --> 25:36.611
But the Monks must have worked that out.

25:36.658 --> 25:38.673
- They've been doing this for millennia.
- Why?

25:38.829 --> 25:42.594
If the link is passed on, the
Monks stay in charge through,

25:42.649 --> 25:45.414
they think, their
ruthlessness and efficiency.

25:45.673 --> 25:48.912
But if the lynchpin dies and the
link isn't passed on and the

25:48.960 --> 25:52.633
Monks get booted off the planet,
they just chalk it up to experience.

25:59.609 --> 26:00.922
No, it's ok.

26:02.414 --> 26:03.767
I want to speak to her.

26:03.815 --> 26:04.875
Yes?

26:05.024 --> 26:07.805
So when you defeated the
Monks, that's how you did it?

26:07.873 --> 26:10.258
Well, at this point, all that
was left of the bloodline

26:10.309 --> 26:14.570
was a wee girl, and I just
pushed her into a volcano.

26:15.473 --> 26:18.293
It's me. The lynchpin is me.

26:19.776 --> 26:22.020
Awwwk-waaard...

26:22.593 --> 26:24.025
So you're saying I have to die.

26:24.073 --> 26:25.832
No. If you were just to die,

26:25.957 --> 26:27.840
everyone's false memories
would have to fade,

26:27.953 --> 26:29.410
and that could take ages.

26:29.513 --> 26:31.712
It's actually better
if you keep breathing,

26:31.879 --> 26:33.723
if your brain just keeps transmitting...

26:33.771 --> 26:38.825
well, nothing. That would blot
out the residue false memories.

26:38.873 --> 26:40.387
What would be left of me?

26:40.513 --> 26:44.770
You'd be a husk. Completely
and irrevocably brain-dead.

26:44.993 --> 26:47.762
You couldn't even get on
Celebrity Love Island.

26:48.277 --> 26:51.032
Even if that was the truth, the
fact that you're suggesting it

26:51.145 --> 26:54.895
shows there's been no
change, no hope, no point.

26:55.425 --> 26:59.730
We don't sacrifice people. It's
wrong... because it's easy.

27:00.006 --> 27:03.237
Back in the day, I'd burn an
entire city to the ground just to

27:03.285 --> 27:05.746
see the pretty shapes the smoke made.

27:06.066 --> 27:08.912
I'm sorry your plus one
doesn't get a happy ending,

27:09.105 --> 27:12.594
but, like it or not, I
just saved this world

27:12.832 --> 27:14.473
because I want to change.

27:15.953 --> 27:18.934
<i>Your version of good is not absolute.</i>

27:19.606 --> 27:22.533
<i>It's vain, arrogant and sentimental.</i>

27:24.160 --> 27:26.762
<i>If you're waiting for me
to become all that...</i>

27:28.053 --> 27:31.173
<i>I'm going to be here
for a long time yet.</i>

27:41.606 --> 27:43.309
- What did she say?
- Nothing.

27:43.453 --> 27:44.845
There's a way to defeat them.

27:44.893 --> 27:46.825
There isn't. Well, there
is, but not that.

27:46.883 --> 27:51.402
Come on! You knew she was going
to say something like this.

27:51.653 --> 27:53.492
That's why you needed me back.

27:53.833 --> 27:55.981
You could have escaped from that ship.

27:56.133 --> 27:59.020
You could have started something
to defeat the Monks without me.

27:59.110 --> 28:03.029
I wanted you back by my side because
it's the safest place in the world.

28:03.093 --> 28:06.293
- Can someone...? What did she say?
- She said it's me.

28:07.222 --> 28:10.184
I asked the Monks for help
and started all of this,

28:11.111 --> 28:13.311
so I have to be the one to finish it.

28:14.093 --> 28:17.773
The only downside is,
if that's what we do...

28:19.272 --> 28:21.897
well, it's not worth me
starting any long books.

28:22.047 --> 28:28.946
Ok, well, er, let's put a pin
in it for now, as they say,

28:29.073 --> 28:32.513
and, er, see if we can
think of something else.

28:33.483 --> 28:35.973
You said the safest place
for me was by your side.

28:36.373 --> 28:38.713
That's what's protecting the Monks.

28:39.620 --> 28:41.580
It's why their plan works.

28:52.853 --> 28:55.147
The Cathedral. The Monks' headquarters.

28:55.487 --> 28:59.694
Oh, yes. We're going to
have to break in there.

29:00.303 --> 29:01.553
Why?

29:02.191 --> 29:06.522
Somewhere in there, the Monks
must have some kind of machine

29:06.772 --> 29:09.905
that creates and broadcasts
the myths of their history,

29:10.095 --> 29:15.061
the ones that are powered by,
carried by, fed by your brainwaves.

29:15.206 --> 29:20.560
So, we get in, I plug myself into it
and replace the signals that they

29:20.561 --> 29:22.483
are receiving with my brainwaves

29:22.600 --> 29:26.662
and beam out the true
history of the world.

29:26.773 --> 29:30.006
Oh, yes! I could even throw
in some other stuff.

29:30.093 --> 29:32.116
The things that I could
change just by thinking.

29:32.230 --> 29:35.022
Racism. People who talk in cinemas!

29:35.108 --> 29:36.387
Are you sure?

29:36.575 --> 29:39.654
This would be an incredibly
sophisticated transmitter,

29:39.702 --> 29:42.581
powerful enough to beam
highly detailed propaganda

29:42.653 --> 29:44.772
to the entire world 24 hours a day,

29:44.936 --> 29:48.014
and you're going to plug
your brain into it?

29:48.133 --> 29:50.973
I know. It doesn't stand a chance.

30:04.933 --> 30:08.011
That's odd, there's no Monks
guarding the entrance.

30:08.133 --> 30:09.812
Come away from the window.

30:10.245 --> 30:11.600
How many Monks were there?

30:11.773 --> 30:14.487
- About 12 Monks there.
- 12?

30:21.493 --> 30:23.324
Well, you have to admit,
that's ever so clever.

30:23.371 --> 30:27.586
You see? Another way they hang
on to power is to create a myth

30:27.634 --> 30:31.602
that they're here in greater
numbers than they really are.

30:31.973 --> 30:36.094
The beam is stronger here, isn't
it? I can almost hear it.

30:36.126 --> 30:39.727
It's so hard to hang on to any
thought of life before the Monks.

30:39.984 --> 30:42.143
Yes, and it's going to get stronger

30:42.253 --> 30:44.572
the closer we get to the transmitter.

30:44.573 --> 30:47.290
The lies are going to
become more convincing.

30:47.834 --> 30:51.313
You'll want to turn around. You
won't know what you're doing here

30:51.758 --> 30:54.413
or why you're working against the Monks.

30:55.358 --> 30:59.461
Have you all got your
stereo, headphone, iThing?

30:59.576 --> 31:02.655
Yeah. You never told us
what we needed these for.

31:02.749 --> 31:04.629
Ah, this is where you come in.

31:20.633 --> 31:23.148
<i>The Monks are not our friends.</i>

31:23.402 --> 31:26.361
<i>They have invaded Earth and
made its people slaves.</i>

31:26.609 --> 31:29.289
<i>They cling onto power by means
of a powerful transmitter</i>

31:29.337 --> 31:31.234
<i>broadcasting myths and lies</i>

31:31.361 --> 31:33.617
<i>that suggest that they
have always been here.</i>

31:35.293 --> 31:38.250
<i>In fact, they have only
been here a few months</i>

31:38.333 --> 31:41.273
<i>and have falsified and
manipulated our history.</i>

31:41.933 --> 31:45.092
<i>Our mission is to interrupt
their broadcast and replace it</i>

31:45.234 --> 31:46.898
<i>with the true history of Earth,</i>

31:47.053 --> 31:49.953
<i>which will weaken and
undermine the Monks' power.</i>

31:51.117 --> 31:53.512
<i>The Monks are not our friends.</i>

31:53.633 --> 31:56.492
<i>They have invaded Earth and
made its people slaves.</i>

31:56.664 --> 31:59.375
<i>They cling onto power by means
of a powerful transmitter,</i>

31:59.453 --> 32:01.125
<i>broadcasting myths and lies</i>

32:01.213 --> 32:03.594
<i>that suggest that they
have always been here.</i>

32:03.657 --> 32:04.788
Take cover!

32:04.961 --> 32:06.984
<i>In fact, they have only
been here a few months</i>

32:07.032 --> 32:09.985
<i>and have falsified and
manipulated our history.</i>

32:10.493 --> 32:13.012
<i>Our mission is to
interrupt their broadcast</i>

32:13.086 --> 32:15.195
<i>and replace it with the
true history of Earth,</i>

32:15.274 --> 32:17.993
<i>which will weaken and
undermine the Monks' power.</i>

32:18.041 --> 32:22.081
<i>The Monks are not our friends.
They have invaded Earth...</i>

32:30.849 --> 32:32.169
Reload it now!

32:39.456 --> 32:40.870
Are you ok?

32:41.063 --> 32:43.062
Yeah, I think it's my...

32:43.355 --> 32:44.886
Oh...

32:45.390 --> 32:46.710
Doctor!

33:05.698 --> 33:07.177
It's in here.

33:11.986 --> 33:13.692
Everything all right, Alan?

33:13.877 --> 33:15.012
You tricked us.

33:15.119 --> 33:18.143
You tried to make us believe
the Monks were invaders.

33:18.510 --> 33:19.916
How could you say that?

33:20.205 --> 33:23.096
They've always been here, you know that.

33:23.266 --> 33:24.706
Uh-huh.

33:26.617 --> 33:27.896
Oh, I see.

33:27.998 --> 33:29.768
The Monks are our friends.

33:29.979 --> 33:31.259
I won't let you hurt them.

33:32.333 --> 33:33.877
I'll die first.

33:34.049 --> 33:35.986
I'll kill you first.

33:41.794 --> 33:43.200
Tarovian Neck Pinch.

33:43.937 --> 33:47.482
Yeah, I studied their martial
arts for a while, actually.

33:47.568 --> 33:49.896
Reached the level of Brown Tabard.

33:50.013 --> 33:51.880
Can't do it with this hand though.

33:51.950 --> 33:54.113
Kind of bugs me. Course, this
wasn't my original hand,

33:54.161 --> 33:56.372
as you know. I won this in a game of...

33:56.444 --> 33:57.804
Yeah, let's...

33:58.873 --> 34:00.113
crack on.

34:11.386 --> 34:13.065
Fake News Central.

34:38.928 --> 34:40.568
I can think.

34:42.453 --> 34:44.327
They're not in my head, why is that?

34:44.706 --> 34:47.166
We're in the eye of the storm.

34:47.913 --> 34:50.827
Guard the doors. We
can't be interrupted.

35:15.425 --> 35:16.465
Boo!

35:18.229 --> 35:19.464
Not necessary.

35:23.214 --> 35:24.774
Ok, he's out, let's do this.

35:49.899 --> 35:51.098
It's working!

35:51.146 --> 35:53.024
The Monks are disappearing!

35:54.539 --> 35:55.818
Oh, I didn't agree to this.

35:55.866 --> 35:57.378
What's happening?

35:57.473 --> 35:58.532
He's fighting back.

35:58.633 --> 36:02.073
He's blocking me, countering every move.

36:11.063 --> 36:12.143
Look!

36:14.562 --> 36:16.180
Oh, no, no, no.

36:25.713 --> 36:27.392
Argh!

36:27.603 --> 36:28.923
Doctor!

36:42.270 --> 36:44.030
I wanted to do it before you woke up.

36:45.453 --> 36:46.733
But I had to say goodbye.

36:48.403 --> 36:51.356
Bill, whatever you're planning,
there's no need for this.

36:51.520 --> 36:53.919
Let me try again. He caught me unawares.

36:53.996 --> 36:55.615
Cup of tea and I'll get my second wind.

36:55.662 --> 36:58.466
Even your brain couldn't stand
another roasting like that.

36:58.538 --> 37:00.357
So we'll find another way.
Let me talk to Missy again.

37:00.404 --> 37:03.333
We have the answer! Doctor, please!

37:03.582 --> 37:06.090
I don't want our last
conversation to be this.

37:06.153 --> 37:08.935
I don't want this to be
our last conversation.

37:15.653 --> 37:17.239
Goodbye, Doctor.

37:25.411 --> 37:26.731
Thank you.

37:29.968 --> 37:31.448
God, it was worth it.

37:39.607 --> 37:40.647
Bill...

37:41.807 --> 37:44.440
Bill, no, don't, Bill. Bill, Bill!

37:44.519 --> 37:46.118
It will kill you, Bill.

37:46.451 --> 37:47.832
It's too powerful!

37:47.943 --> 37:50.293
Bill! I... I order you!

37:50.477 --> 37:51.880
I'm ordering you not to do this!

37:51.928 --> 37:52.943
Bill!

37:52.995 --> 37:54.584
Nardole, untie me!

37:57.984 --> 37:59.503
Nardole, untie me now!

37:59.606 --> 38:01.125
Bill, don't do this!

38:01.173 --> 38:02.213
Ok.

38:06.766 --> 38:09.285
I don't usually let someone erase
my brain on the first date,

38:09.333 --> 38:12.213
but seeing as it's you...

38:13.304 --> 38:14.344
No!

38:33.573 --> 38:35.013
Oh, no.

38:36.933 --> 38:39.613
No, no, no, no, no, no!

38:40.653 --> 38:42.855
They're hijacking her memories.

38:43.206 --> 38:45.722
Infecting them like a virus.

38:45.880 --> 38:47.878
She's just reinforcing their lies.

38:48.826 --> 38:50.826
She's dying for nothing!

38:53.932 --> 38:57.744
Argh! There must be a way
to shut this thing down!

39:08.050 --> 39:09.416
Hello, Mum.

39:12.813 --> 39:14.320
Doctor, look!

39:25.813 --> 39:29.212
You clever, brilliant, ridiculous girl!

39:29.343 --> 39:33.008
Look at that! All the pictures I
gave you! I thought I was just

39:33.070 --> 39:34.906
being kind, but I was saving the world.

39:34.973 --> 39:38.055
Bill, if there's any of you
left in there, listen,

39:38.173 --> 39:41.617
you have to keep thinking about
your mum, the memory you created.

39:41.813 --> 39:45.353
Her voice, her smile, the
Monks can't get near it.

39:47.213 --> 39:51.360
Fill your mind with it!
Push it into every corner.

39:53.674 --> 39:54.714
Bill.

39:55.716 --> 39:56.756
Mum!

39:58.009 --> 40:02.016
She's filling its mind with
one pure, uncorrupted,

40:02.181 --> 40:03.932
irresistible image.

40:04.107 --> 40:07.403
And it's broadcasting it to the
world, because it can't help it.

40:07.924 --> 40:10.400
All those years you kept
her alive inside you,

40:10.478 --> 40:13.478
an isolated subroutine in a living mind.

40:14.532 --> 40:16.972
Perfect, untouchable.

40:18.602 --> 40:21.408
She's a window on the
world without the Monks.

40:23.614 --> 40:27.307
Absolutely loved, absolutely trusted.

40:28.049 --> 40:32.373
And that window is opening everywhere.

40:32.945 --> 40:35.025
A glimpse of freedom.

40:37.219 --> 40:38.696
But a glimpse...

40:39.776 --> 40:41.373
is all you need.

40:41.636 --> 40:44.416
The lie is breaking!

40:45.782 --> 40:48.899
Bill's mum, you just went viral!

41:01.179 --> 41:03.078
You did it, you broke the signal.

41:03.163 --> 41:04.665
What are the Monks going to do?

41:04.839 --> 41:08.547
What oppressors always do when they
realise who's really in power...

41:09.661 --> 41:10.941
They run.

41:26.355 --> 41:28.105
This is exciting, isn't it?

41:28.306 --> 41:30.605
Kind of... It's like a turning point.

41:30.901 --> 41:34.222
Humans have learned that they can
overthrow dictators and stuff,

41:34.487 --> 41:35.666
they just have to band together.

41:35.713 --> 41:37.597
It's not quite as simple as that.

41:38.185 --> 41:42.704
You, Appalling Hair, this thing
that we're sitting on, what is it?

41:42.894 --> 41:46.519
Uh, we thought they were just like
filming something here or something?

41:46.567 --> 41:47.636
Thank you. Very helpful.

41:47.693 --> 41:49.737
Now go away, or something.

41:51.776 --> 41:52.877
You see?

41:52.933 --> 41:55.052
The Monks have erased themselves.

41:55.408 --> 41:58.864
Humanity is doomed to never
learn from its mistakes.

42:00.941 --> 42:04.141
Well, I guess that's part of our charm.

42:04.812 --> 42:06.933
No, it's really quite annoying.

42:09.077 --> 42:10.877
Anyway, I mustn't keep you.

42:11.493 --> 42:13.253
3,000 words.

42:14.050 --> 42:15.372
The Mechanics of Free Will.

42:15.464 --> 42:17.893
Now six months overdue.

42:21.128 --> 42:22.823
Why do you put up with us, then?

42:24.793 --> 42:26.713
In amongst seven billion...

42:27.670 --> 42:29.430
there's someone like you.

42:32.483 --> 42:34.203
That's why I put up
with the rest of them.

42:57.626 --> 42:59.986
I keep remembering all
the people I've killed.

43:03.288 --> 43:04.888
Every day I think of more.

43:06.851 --> 43:08.171
Being bad...

43:09.561 --> 43:11.401
Being bad drowned that out.

43:14.180 --> 43:16.320
I didn't know I even knew their names.

43:20.535 --> 43:22.775
You didn't tell me about this bit.

43:24.148 --> 43:26.013
I'm sorry, but this is good.

43:29.999 --> 43:31.180
Ok.

43:38.013 --> 43:40.273
There were humans on
Mars in Victorian times?

43:40.422 --> 43:41.972
No, there weren't.

43:42.508 --> 43:45.332
- Faraday asked for my help.
- In return for what?

43:45.547 --> 43:46.851
Halt!

43:46.899 --> 43:49.338
This could be the entrance
to an Ice Warrior hive.

43:49.446 --> 43:52.609
Faraday has been using you all along.

43:52.727 --> 43:55.646
His aim was to get back to
Mars and find his queen.

43:55.733 --> 43:58.578
Rise, my Ice Warriors!

43:58.703 --> 44:00.640
Rise!

44:00.797 --> 44:03.436
I dare say the British Army is
more than a match for a bunch

44:03.493 --> 44:05.203
of upright crocodiles!

44:05.448 --> 44:08.461
You don't stand a chance
when you see those warriors.
