(mellow music playing)

00:56.834 --> 00:58.834
Oh, boy, what a day.

01:01.633 --> 01:02.633
What happened, Ma,

01:02.700 --> 01:05.333
Butch and Sundance steal
your seat on the bus?

01:06.233 --> 01:07.600
I had a miserable day at work.

01:07.967 --> 01:10.300
That stupid manager
docked me half a day's pay

01:10.367 --> 01:11.934
for saying hello to customers.

01:12.000 --> 01:16.567
-You're not allowed to say hello?
-Not at Pecos Pete's chow wagon.

01:16.633 --> 01:18.033
You have to say howdy.

01:18.100 --> 01:21.166
As a matter of fact,
you have to say, "Howdy, partner.

01:21.233 --> 01:24.533
How about a saddlebag of fries
with that ranch house burger?"

01:26.166 --> 01:28.900
I don't know why
it doesn't trip naturally off my tongue.

01:32.000 --> 01:35.133
Sophia, they took
half your day's pay just for that?

01:35.200 --> 01:36.667
This manager is a shark.

01:36.734 --> 01:38.333
He's bucking for supervisor.

01:38.400 --> 01:42.600
He told Mildred and Edna they could only
take 10-minute bathroom breaks.

01:42.667 --> 01:46.333
-Ma, that's not unreasonable.
-Please, they're 85 years old!

01:46.400 --> 01:48.734
It takes Mildred 10 minutes
to roll down her stockings.

01:52.700 --> 01:55.000
Guess what the mail brought.

01:55.066 --> 01:59.734
If it's another adult toy from a sleazy
magazine, I'm not interested.

02:00.767 --> 02:04.300
-I am. Let me see it.
-Ma, wait your turn.

02:06.400 --> 02:09.033
It's a post card
from my daughter Rebecca.

02:09.100 --> 02:12.233
Girls, can you believe it?
After almost four years,

02:12.300 --> 02:16.367
my baby's coming to see me.
I'm so happy, I could cry.

02:16.433 --> 02:20.400
-Blanche, you are crying.
-Admit it, Rose.

02:20.467 --> 02:23.934
You worked for allied intelligence
during world war II.

02:24.900 --> 02:27.600
-Huh?
-Fine. Play it cagey.

02:28.700 --> 02:31.800
-When is she coming?
-She says in two weeks.

02:31.867 --> 02:36.400
She signs it, "love, Rebecca."
I guess she's forgiven me.

02:36.467 --> 02:39.667
-Forgiven you for what?
-It's too difficult to talk about.

02:39.734 --> 02:42.700
She wanted to leave school
to become a fashion model.

02:42.767 --> 02:47.033
-Your daughter's a fashion model?
-She's just beautiful. Always has been.

02:47.100 --> 02:52.233
Gorgeous blonde hair, sparkling blue eyes,
a figure men would mortgage a house for.

02:52.767 --> 02:54.934
We were always so much alike.

02:57.033 --> 03:00.066
And so close,
just like Siamese twins.

03:00.133 --> 03:03.233
It's a shame when they separated you,
you got both butts.

03:06.333 --> 03:07.967
Yes.

03:08.266 --> 03:11.567
Anyway, we had a terrible fight
about her quitting school.

03:11.633 --> 03:14.700
She told me to stay out of her life and
she ran off to Paris to become a model.

03:14.767 --> 03:18.200
She swore she would never to speak to me,
and she hasn't until today.

03:18.266 --> 03:22.967
-That's all in the past now.
-I hope so. I've missed her.

03:23.033 --> 03:24.467
She's my favorite.

03:24.533 --> 03:28.867
It sure makes me appreciate the special
relationship I have with my daughter.

03:29.233 --> 03:31.000
-Pussycat...
-Yes, Ma?

03:31.066 --> 03:33.834
Dial your sister for me.
I never remember the area code.

03:35.133 --> 03:39.900
(calm music playing)

03:45.000 --> 03:46.100
Uh-huh.

03:46.700 --> 03:49.133
Yeah, right. Six o'clock at Mildred's.

03:49.200 --> 03:53.600
We're putting together a list of demands
to present to McCracken at work tomorrow.

03:54.700 --> 03:58.667
Good.
Oh, and Edna, bring some sherry.

03:58.734 --> 04:02.900
Nobody bought that glaucoma story when you
whipped out that reefer last time.

04:05.433 --> 04:08.033
No, no, you can't put it in brownies.

04:10.567 --> 04:13.500
I said no reefers, okay? Goodbye.

04:15.800 --> 04:17.900
You know, Sophia,
the problems you're having

04:17.967 --> 04:20.300
remind me of something
that happened back in St. Olaf.

04:20.367 --> 04:22.967
Please. Dust reminds you
of something back at St. Olaf.

04:23.300 --> 04:24.533
I got work to do.

04:24.600 --> 04:27.533
Ma, I moved some of your things
into my room.

04:28.133 --> 04:31.000
-Why'd you do that?
-Blanche's daughter arrives today.

04:31.066 --> 04:32.300
You have to sleep with me.

04:32.367 --> 04:35.333
Let me respond to that proposition
the way your dates do.

04:35.734 --> 04:37.467
No, thanks. I'll call you sometime.

04:40.767 --> 04:44.433
-Ok, girls, how do I look?
-Blanche, you look beautiful.

04:44.500 --> 04:46.166
Do I look like a mother?

04:47.300 --> 04:50.500
Are you kidding?
You look like you're about to drop twins.

04:53.266 --> 04:55.700
Blanche, relax, honey. You look lovely.

04:55.767 --> 04:58.967
It's just that I'm so nervous
about seeing Becky after so long.

04:59.033 --> 05:01.967
-I want everything perfect.
-It will be.

05:02.033 --> 05:05.033
It's been four years.
I don't know what to say to her.

05:05.100 --> 05:09.533
Johnny Carson had that same problem
the other night with F. Murray Abraham.

05:10.800 --> 05:13.533
-(doorbell rings)
-Good lord, that's her.

05:14.033 --> 05:15.967
Oh, my beautiful baby girl.

05:16.567 --> 05:19.500
Oh. Oh, gosh. I can't do this.
I'm not ready.

05:20.266 --> 05:22.800
-Blanche, come back here.
-I need more time.

05:22.867 --> 05:27.200
-It's been four years.
-I just need four years and five minutes.

05:28.367 --> 05:32.233
-(doorbell rings)
-All right. All right. I'm coming.

05:36.333 --> 05:37.333
Hi.

05:38.333 --> 05:39.934
You're Blanche's daughter, the model?

05:49.600 --> 05:51.467
What did she model, car covers?

05:54.900 --> 05:59.867
-You'll have to forgive my mother.
-We didn't expect you to be this fat.

06:03.533 --> 06:08.767
Becky, it's a pleasure meeting you.
I'm Dorothy. This is Rose.

06:08.834 --> 06:11.700
-This is my mother Sophia.
-It's nice to meet y'all.

06:11.767 --> 06:16.200
-What brings you to Miami?
-My guess is a small barge.

06:19.600 --> 06:22.266
Ma, why don't you see what's
keeping Blanche?

06:23.166 --> 06:25.900
-Mama.
-Rebecca.

06:26.367 --> 06:29.367
Oh, honey. Honey.

06:29.433 --> 06:34.100
-Oh, let me get a look at you.
-This could take several hours.

06:36.300 --> 06:40.433
-Oh, darling, I have missed you so much.
-I missed you, too, Mama.

06:40.500 --> 06:44.433
-We should leave them alone.
-Don't you leave, girls.

06:44.500 --> 06:49.300
I want my friends here to share my
happiness, my enormous happiness.

06:50.800 --> 06:54.633
Honey, tell me all about Paris.
Where did you live? Where did you work?

06:54.700 --> 06:56.667
Where did you find jeans that size?

06:58.233 --> 07:00.233
-Sophia.
-It's ok.

07:00.300 --> 07:03.567
I may have lost my figure,
but I still have my sense of humor.

07:04.600 --> 07:09.800
-Does it bother you that I gained weight?
-I'm just so glad to have you back.

07:09.867 --> 07:13.834
I'll show you where you'll stay.

07:13.900 --> 07:16.734
Now I understand why she's sleeping
in Blanche's bed.

07:16.800 --> 07:18.967
It supports the weight
of an average female

07:19.033 --> 07:21.100
and two Venezuelan soccer players.

07:26.834 --> 07:29.967
-Here we are.
-I love your home, Mama.

07:30.033 --> 07:31.100
Thank you.

07:32.066 --> 07:35.667
Well, honey, tell me
how's your modeling career?

07:36.266 --> 07:38.934
Well, to be honest, Mama,
not too well lately.

07:39.734 --> 07:42.133
-What have you been doing?
-You mean besides eating?

07:43.967 --> 07:46.600
-I didn't say that.
-That's what you meant.

07:47.300 --> 07:49.600
Well, you have filled out a little bit.

07:50.033 --> 07:53.166
But I don't want you to be upset over this

07:53.233 --> 07:55.166
because we can fix it.
I'm gonna put you on a diet

07:55.233 --> 07:56.734
and I'm gonna make you stay on it.

07:56.800 --> 07:59.900
I don't want your help.
I'm happy just the way I am.

07:59.967 --> 08:02.767
Happy? Baby, look at yourself.
How could you be happy?

08:03.066 --> 08:05.834
You're the one that's not happy, Mama.
You're doing it again.

08:05.900 --> 08:08.667
-You'll tell me how to live my life.
-What do you mean?

08:08.734 --> 08:11.433
Nothing's ever enough for you.
It wasn't enough that I was pretty.

08:11.500 --> 08:13.000
I had to be the prettiest.

08:13.066 --> 08:17.467
Or that I had to be the most popular.
Or that I had to be the brightest.

08:17.533 --> 08:19.934
That didn't mean you had to run out
and become the fattest.

08:24.233 --> 08:27.800
Mama, you have to accept me
for what I am.

08:27.867 --> 08:32.667
You have to stop trying to tell me how
to run my life or else I'll have to leave.

08:33.166 --> 08:36.333
No, honey.
You know, you're absolutely right.

08:36.767 --> 08:37.900
I'm sorry.

08:38.233 --> 08:43.367
Hey, I love you just the way you are.
Every last pound of you.

08:44.934 --> 08:47.700
Just exactly how many pounds
is it I'm currently loving?

08:48.500 --> 08:51.000
Mama.

08:51.967 --> 08:58.300
(serene music playing)

08:58.800 --> 09:00.400
Sophia, how was your meeting?

09:00.767 --> 09:04.233
Terrible. That weasel
manager wouldn't budge.

09:04.300 --> 09:07.133
He pushed us to the wall.
Now it's all-out war.

09:07.200 --> 09:08.200
What do you mean?

09:08.266 --> 09:13.667
Tomorrow morning, all chow wagon employees
over age 70 are officially out on strike.

09:13.734 --> 09:15.400
You're picketing the restaurant?

09:15.467 --> 09:21.066
No. We'll wear war paint and shoot flaming
arrows at the covered wagon out front.

09:23.367 --> 09:26.633
Gee, that might even get you
on the 6:00 news.

09:27.700 --> 09:29.800
The table's all set.

09:29.867 --> 09:31.934
Rebecca should be here
with Jeremy any minute.

09:32.000 --> 09:35.033
Did Rebecca bring Jeremy
just to meet you?

09:35.100 --> 09:39.300
-She didn't say. I didn't ask.
-Think he might be her boyfriend?

09:39.567 --> 09:43.367
I didn't see any pictures of him
when I went through her things.

09:44.567 --> 09:47.266
Why didn't you just ask?

09:47.333 --> 09:50.467
I don't stick my nose
where it doesn't belong.

09:52.667 --> 09:55.000
-(doorbell rings)
-That must be them.

10:00.767 --> 10:04.000
-Hi, Mama. This is Jeremy.
-Nice to meet you.

10:04.066 --> 10:06.467
-A pleasure to meet you.
-Come in. Sit down.

10:07.333 --> 10:08.934
You have
a lovely home.

10:09.000 --> 10:11.600
Thank you. You seem like
a very nice young man.

10:11.667 --> 10:13.467
Oh, he is.

10:13.533 --> 10:16.233
-Becky, was she talking to you?
-I'm sorry.

10:17.033 --> 10:21.033
-Hors d'oeuvres are being served.
-Jeremy, meet my mother's friends,

10:21.100 --> 10:24.567
-Dorothy, Sophia, and Rose.
-Nice to meet you.

10:24.633 --> 10:28.700
-Jeremy, where did you meet?
-At a sidewalk cafe in Paris.

10:28.767 --> 10:32.934
There weren't any tables left,
so I just sat at Becky.

10:35.800 --> 10:39.133
Why don't we move to the lanai for dinner?

10:39.200 --> 10:42.433
-I'll show you the way.
-Let me help you.

10:42.500 --> 10:44.367
-Becky.
-Oh, yeah.

10:46.233 --> 10:49.867
(mellow music playing)

10:53.467 --> 10:55.400
That fettucini was sensational.

10:55.834 --> 10:57.433
You ladies made
a great meal.

10:57.700 --> 11:02.033
While you're handing out compliments,
you haven't mentioned my new outfit.

11:02.100 --> 11:03.567
That's not very nice.

11:03.633 --> 11:06.867
I'm trying to be nice,
so I didn't say anything.

11:08.900 --> 11:10.633
Why don't you all sit there
and get comfortable,

11:10.700 --> 11:12.567
and I'll make hot coffee...

11:13.033 --> 11:15.166
and pour it down his pants.

11:16.233 --> 11:19.700
-How can you let him talk that way?
-Dorothy's right.

11:19.767 --> 11:22.767
I haven't heard anyone insult someone
like that

11:22.834 --> 11:27.467
since Lars Swensen
called Eric the red a yellow coward.

11:28.400 --> 11:30.400
Wouldn't that make him Eric the orange?

11:32.200 --> 11:35.200
Girls, I'm not meddling in Becky's
personal life.

11:35.266 --> 11:39.400
-That already cost me four years.
-Blanche, this is different.

11:39.467 --> 11:42.633
-He's downright cruel to her.
-If Rebecca doesn't mind,

11:42.700 --> 11:44.433
it's not my business.

11:45.000 --> 11:47.266
Besides, she's only known
him a short time.

11:47.333 --> 11:50.066
I'm sure she'll come to her senses soon.

11:51.867 --> 11:56.500
-Oh, Ma, you don't have to help.
-I couldn't listen to that anymore.

11:56.567 --> 11:58.600
You mean Jeremy's rude remarks.

11:58.667 --> 12:01.166
I mean Rebecca talking
about marrying that jerk.

12:03.300 --> 12:06.834
Are you telling me Rebecca and Jeremy
are planning to get married?

12:06.900 --> 12:10.100
-Yeah. I overheard them talking.
-Maybe you misunderstood.

12:10.166 --> 12:12.000
Please. Me misunderstand?

12:12.500 --> 12:15.367
My bladder may be weak,
my eyesight may be failing,

12:15.433 --> 12:16.900
my bones may be brittle...

12:17.567 --> 12:19.900
I see your point. You better double-check.

12:26.467 --> 12:28.200
Rebecca, Jeremy...

12:29.066 --> 12:32.600
-is there something you'd like to tell me?
-Yes.

12:32.667 --> 12:33.800
Let me do it.

12:34.500 --> 12:38.767
Blanche... I'd like to ask
for your daughter's hand in marriage.

12:39.233 --> 12:42.000
I'd take the rest,
but I've got a bad back.

12:43.633 --> 12:45.867
Jeremy, be serious.

12:45.934 --> 12:49.967
Jeremy's asked me to marry him,
and I've said yes.

12:51.567 --> 12:53.633
Aren't you happy for me?

12:54.200 --> 12:59.867
Happy? Happy? Honey!
Happy isn't the word for it.

13:04.767 --> 13:09.600
(serene music playing)

13:16.166 --> 13:17.233
We're off to the game!

13:17.300 --> 13:22.467
-Do you play baseball?
-We're going to see a game.

13:22.533 --> 13:25.867
We're going to Vero beach
to see the dodgers.

13:25.934 --> 13:28.734
-Jeremy's a big baseball fan.
-Becky's a bigger one.

13:28.800 --> 13:30.300
Becky's a bigger everything.

13:31.734 --> 13:33.200
Not everything, Jeremy.

13:41.500 --> 13:43.433
We'd better go.
We don't want to miss anything.

13:43.500 --> 13:47.967
I'm buying Becky a dodger cap
to see if people mistake her for Lasorda.

13:48.333 --> 13:52.934
-That's it! That is it!
-Calm down. We'll bring you a cap, too.

13:55.967 --> 13:58.700
I can't take it.
I've got to say something.

13:58.767 --> 14:03.066
I know how frustrating it is,
but there's nothing we can do.

14:03.133 --> 14:05.200
It's her daughter, it's her choice.

14:05.266 --> 14:07.400
It's like something
that happened back in St. Olaf.

14:07.467 --> 14:08.934
Oh, Rose, stop.

14:09.400 --> 14:14.633
Why is it when anyone makes an observation
you say "back in St. Olaf"?

14:14.700 --> 14:17.600
Did you ever realize we might be sick
of hearing

14:17.667 --> 14:21.467
"back in St. Olaf, back in St. Olaf"?

14:21.967 --> 14:24.633
Gee, no. I never realized.

14:26.433 --> 14:29.133
-I'm sorry.
-Oh, that's ok.

14:32.800 --> 14:34.500
Back in that town whose name you're
tired--

14:34.567 --> 14:35.767
Rose!

14:38.200 --> 14:40.900
-Clear out. We need the kitchen.
-What's going on?

14:40.967 --> 14:43.867
-A showdown with McCracken.
-Your boss is coming?

14:43.934 --> 14:47.266
A week on strike affected business.
He wants to negotiate.

14:47.333 --> 14:49.834
I insisted we negotiate on our turf.

14:50.700 --> 14:52.900
-(doorbell rings)
-That's him. Let him in.

14:52.967 --> 14:54.567
I've got to prepare the table.

15:01.734 --> 15:04.433
-Why are you doing that?
-It's a power move.

15:04.500 --> 15:08.300
Three against one,
and I get to look down on him.

15:10.333 --> 15:12.133
Ma, Mr. McCracken's here.

15:18.967 --> 15:23.333
Let's get down to business.
I've got to get back to the chow wagon.

15:23.400 --> 15:26.233
We'll just leave you to your negotiations.

15:26.500 --> 15:30.300
Before we go,
can we get you some milk and Oreos?

15:31.233 --> 15:32.233
No, thanks.

15:32.767 --> 15:34.433
Boy, he's tough.

15:36.467 --> 15:37.533
Have a seat, boss.

15:38.633 --> 15:40.834
I've read and reread your list of demands.

15:40.900 --> 15:44.633
Wait, McCracken.
I want to tell you something.

15:44.700 --> 15:46.934
I'm no novice when it
comes to negotiations.

15:47.000 --> 15:49.667
-Oh, really?
-Let me tell you a story.

15:50.266 --> 15:53.200
Picture it, Sicily, 1922.

15:55.133 --> 15:57.900
An attractive peasant girl
who has saved her lira

15:57.967 --> 16:03.266
embarks on a glorious vacation
to a Crimean resort on the black sea.

16:03.333 --> 16:07.266
For weeks, she frolics
at this seaside resort

16:07.333 --> 16:11.066
enjoying the company of men,
all of whom adore her.

16:11.133 --> 16:12.633
All of them?

16:14.100 --> 16:15.800
Shut up, Edna. I work alone.

16:17.934 --> 16:19.166
All of them.

16:19.233 --> 16:24.333
When it's time to return to Sicily,
three different suitors beg her to stay.

16:25.100 --> 16:28.834
She can't decide,
so she chooses none of them.

16:28.900 --> 16:33.934
She agrees to meet them
at the same resort many years later.

16:34.600 --> 16:36.367
To her trio of suitors,

16:36.433 --> 16:41.734
that eventful gathering was referred to
as "rendezvous with Sophia."

16:42.834 --> 16:47.166
But to the rest of the world, it was
better known as the Yalta conference.

16:50.667 --> 16:52.433
You expect me to buy that?

16:52.500 --> 16:57.266
I came here so you wouldn't cause a scene
when I fired you.

16:58.467 --> 16:59.467
Fired us?

16:59.533 --> 17:03.133
No story you could tell
will change my mind.

17:03.200 --> 17:08.266
Not even the one we'd tell your father
about how his car got dented

17:08.333 --> 17:12.600
while you were doing wheelies,
and not while it was parked?

17:12.667 --> 17:15.266
You wouldn't do that, would you?

17:15.333 --> 17:18.700
Hey, she's your grandmother.
Has she ever lied to you?

17:20.800 --> 17:26.066
(calm music playing)

17:28.767 --> 17:32.266
Is Jeremy coming over in a taxi
or driving the rental car?

17:32.333 --> 17:34.700
-He's taking the car.
-That's good.

17:35.433 --> 17:39.433
-Oh... I guess this is it.
-I hate these moments.

17:39.500 --> 17:41.500
I never did learn how to say goodbye.

17:41.567 --> 17:44.567
There are so many ways to say farewell.

17:45.433 --> 17:50.433
<i>Auf wiedersehen, arrivederci,</i>
<i>adios, hasta luego--</i>

17:50.500 --> 17:51.834
Get lost.

17:54.333 --> 17:57.300
See, there's another one. Good, Dorothy.

17:58.300 --> 18:00.200
(doorbell rings)

18:02.967 --> 18:05.633
-Didn't you hear me honking?
-We were just saying goodbye.

18:05.700 --> 18:08.734
Hop to it.
Kiss-kiss, we're out of here.

18:08.800 --> 18:11.967
Thanks for being understanding
about our wedding plans.

18:12.033 --> 18:14.100
That's me, old understanding mama.

18:14.166 --> 18:17.767
It's really so much simpler
if we run off by ourselves.

18:17.834 --> 18:20.166
That'll be the day when you run anywhere.

18:21.266 --> 18:23.500
Could you be patient, Jeremy?

18:23.567 --> 18:26.700
I know things move slow here
at Sunnybrook farm,

18:26.767 --> 18:28.667
but we're catching a plane.

18:29.300 --> 18:30.500
-Into the kitchen.
-What?

18:30.567 --> 18:32.734
Into the kitchen right now.

18:46.033 --> 18:50.233
I've held my tongue for two solid weeks,
but I cannot any longer.

18:50.300 --> 18:52.433
I am your mother,

18:52.500 --> 18:55.667
and I cannot let you go
without asking you,

18:55.734 --> 19:01.767
why, of all the men on God's green earth,
are you marrying that lump of nothing?

19:01.834 --> 19:04.300
Because I want a husband.
I want a family,

19:04.367 --> 19:07.333
-Jeremy may be my last chance.
-That's nonsense.

19:07.400 --> 19:10.300
Oh, Mama, look at me. Open your eyes.

19:10.367 --> 19:14.934
-I'm not beautiful. I'm not a catch.
-For that man, you are.

19:15.000 --> 19:19.500
He's got you thinking you need him,
but he needs you.

19:19.567 --> 19:24.934
You're probably the only woman kind
enough to give him a second glance.

19:25.000 --> 19:26.300
He's not good enough for you.

19:26.367 --> 19:29.500
Do you hear what you're saying?
You're doing it again!

19:29.567 --> 19:32.633
Say what you really mean,
he's not good enough for you,

19:32.700 --> 19:35.667
and neither am I.
I wish I'd never come.

19:35.734 --> 19:38.867
-Rebecca!
-Let's go, Jeremy.

19:38.934 --> 19:40.367
-Finally.
-Rebecca!

19:42.967 --> 19:44.533
Rebecca, wait!

19:45.934 --> 19:47.734
Oh, damn.

19:49.700 --> 19:54.033
(calm music playing)

20:01.233 --> 20:03.767
Blanche doesn't usually go to bed at 8:00.

20:04.100 --> 20:05.533
At least not by herself.

20:07.667 --> 20:09.734
Blanche is depressed, Rose.

20:09.800 --> 20:12.133
Do you think she's depressed
about Rebecca?

20:12.633 --> 20:13.633
No, Rose.

20:13.700 --> 20:17.500
She's depressed because <i>Marblehead Manor</i>
is only on once a week.

20:17.900 --> 20:19.400
Ah.

20:21.200 --> 20:24.233
I remember when I was little
when we'd get depressed.

20:24.300 --> 20:26.633
Grandma could always cheer us up.

20:26.934 --> 20:28.867
She'd take out her dentures.

20:30.834 --> 20:34.000
She'd take a healthy swig
from the aquarium,

20:34.066 --> 20:36.867
then she'd put a
flashlight under her chin,

20:36.934 --> 20:39.834
and we'd watch the fish
swim from cheek to cheek.

20:45.233 --> 20:47.166
We could have watched it all day...

20:47.600 --> 20:50.133
but visiting hours were
only from 10:00 to 4:00.

20:54.700 --> 20:59.633
I couldn't sleep. I kept thinking about
the terrible mistake I made.

20:59.700 --> 21:01.633
You did right.

21:01.700 --> 21:03.767
You're only saying that
'cause you're my friend.

21:03.834 --> 21:07.934
-Am I a bad mother?
-You did what you had to do.

21:08.033 --> 21:12.700
-Then why do I feel terrible?
-Because it's not easy being a mother.

21:12.767 --> 21:15.033
If it were easy, fathers would do it.

21:18.300 --> 21:21.834
Why can't kids understand
we're trying to do what's best?

21:21.900 --> 21:22.934
They're kids.

21:23.000 --> 21:25.734
When they become mothers,
they know better, right?

21:25.800 --> 21:26.800
Right, Ma.

21:26.867 --> 21:32.800
When I was a teenager, you'd make me bring
my dates into meet you.

21:32.867 --> 21:35.800
-I always hated that.
-What an inconvenience.

21:36.233 --> 21:39.000
Between the ages of 12 and 19,
I met two guys.

21:41.500 --> 21:46.433
I remember my mother making me
practice the tuba, three hours a day...

21:46.900 --> 21:49.433
seven days a week, for 10 years.

21:49.834 --> 21:53.166
I hated it, but it finally paid off.

21:53.233 --> 21:56.967
-You play the tuba?
-No. I gave it up...

21:57.800 --> 22:01.266
but I can blow 32 pounds of air
into a tire in less than a minute.

22:05.233 --> 22:08.734
-(doorbell rings)
-Who could that be at this hour?

22:08.800 --> 22:09.934
I'll see.

22:14.266 --> 22:17.233
-Hi, Mama.
-Am I glad to see you. I'm sorry--

22:17.300 --> 22:20.867
-Don't apologize. You were right.
-What?

22:20.934 --> 22:25.600
I thought about what you said,
the courage it took to say it,

22:25.667 --> 22:28.266
and I realized how much you love me.

22:28.734 --> 22:32.300
-Oh, baby.
-You were right about Jeremy.

22:32.700 --> 22:34.133
I can do better.

22:34.200 --> 22:36.300
It took someone who loved me
to point it out.

22:36.767 --> 22:39.500
Let's go tell the girls.

22:39.567 --> 22:43.300
-They're in the kitchen having cheesecake.
-Boy, cheesecake, that sounds great.

22:43.367 --> 22:45.734
Why don't we just sit on the lanai?

22:47.367 --> 22:51.967
(mellow music playing)

22:54.166 --> 22:56.867
Goodbye, sugar.
Call me as soon as you get home.

22:56.934 --> 22:59.633
-Ok, I will. Bye.
-Bye-bye.

23:18.266 --> 23:19.467
Ahh.

23:21.166 --> 23:23.200
Mmm.

23:24.100 --> 23:25.867
Ahh.

23:27.734 --> 23:31.200
Hey, I thought we agreed we weren't going
to talk about the children.

23:38.934 --> 23:44.967
(theme music playing)
