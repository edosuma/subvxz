Hey, did I ever
tell you the story

00:38.038 --> 00:40.490
of the time I got my head
stuck in the banister?

00:40.557 --> 00:42.225
196 times.

00:42.292 --> 00:44.027
In fact, why don't
I tell it to you?

00:44.094 --> 00:45.395
You were eight

00:45.462 --> 00:47.330
and you got your head stuck
in the staircase banister.

00:47.398 --> 00:49.332
So your mother buttered
your ears and slid you out.

00:49.400 --> 00:50.733
And that's why, to this day,

00:50.801 --> 00:54.203
you always carry a stick
of butter in your purse.

00:54.271 --> 00:56.039
Yep.

00:56.106 --> 00:58.508
That's the banister story.

Oh, my God.

is going to be?

old story over and over?

Just say the word and we'll jump
into the suicide pit.

down there, wouldn't you?

01:14.458 --> 01:15.658

"Tie me up with string 'cause
that was my favorite thing!"

03:10.908 --> 03:12.708
After that, they do it
on the Viking rangetop

03:12.776 --> 03:14.644

You passed out
making mac and cheese.

09:16.967 --> 09:19.702
Why didn't you
turn off the stove?

09:19.770 --> 09:21.203
You guys laughed
at my head.

call you "Francine."

as you have that baby,

20:18.160 --> 20:20.362
you're going to be so glad
we broke into your house

20:20.429 --> 20:22.397
and sabotaged
your birth control.

20:22.465 --> 20:25.483
You what?
You two are monsters.

20:25.568 --> 20:26.935
You were right.

20:27.003 --> 20:28.870
You said there was
something off about them.

20:28.938 --> 20:30.338
Yeah, and you said
there was no way

20:30.406 --> 20:31.906
she was a day under 40.

20:31.974 --> 20:33.742
You bitch.
Honey, she's right.

20:33.809 --> 20:35.910
Oh, Cami, I'll never
doubt you again.

20:35.978 --> 20:37.479
I missed you.

20:37.546 --> 20:39.781
Come on.
Let's get out of here

20:39.849 --> 20:41.983
before one of these geezers
has a heart attack.

20:42.051 --> 20:44.519
Why would I tweezer
my fart crack?

20:44.587 --> 20:45.954
Stupid kids.

20:46.022 --> 20:48.223
You know, Stan,
maybe it's best

20:48.291 --> 20:49.658
if we don't
have friends.

20:49.725 --> 20:51.626
What do you say
you and me go home

20:51.694 --> 20:53.328
and tell each other
boring stories

20:53.396 --> 20:54.596
for the rest of our lives?

20:54.664 --> 20:56.498
That sounds perfect.

20:58.768 --> 21:01.686
You guys have been talking
through the whole damn show.

21:01.771 --> 21:03.121
Watch this.
I'm so sorry.

21:03.189 --> 21:04.506
Nut punch!
Block!

21:04.573 --> 21:06.941
Counter-nut punch!

21:06.993 --> 21:09.327
Always funny.
