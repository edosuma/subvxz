Have you seen a kung fu movie?

21:16.820 --> 21:17.660
It was like that.

21:17.720 --> 21:19.130
Now I know her moves.

21:19.190 --> 21:22.100
So If you're listening, Lady,
you better think long and hard

21:22.160 --> 21:25.430
before trying something like
this on Homer Simpson again.

21:25.500 --> 21:29.870
LORD HELP ME,
I'M JUST NOT THAT BRIGHT.

21:29.930 --> 21:33.730
OH, HOMER,
DON'T SAY THAT.

21:33.800 --> 21:34.560
THE WAY I SEE IT

21:34.640 --> 21:36.940
IF YOU RAISE THREE CHILDREN

21:37.010 --> 21:39.610
WHO CAN KNOCK OUT AND HOG-TIE
A PERFECT STRANGER

21:39.680 --> 21:41.420
YOU MUST BE DOING
SOMETHING RIGHT.

21:41.480 --> 21:43.850
YEAH.

21:44.880 --> 21:47.240
YEAH!

21:50.090 --> 21:52.560
Homer:
HONEY, CAN WE MAKE UP AGAIN?

21:52.620 --> 21:55.050
Marge:
OH, MY GOODNESS!

21:55.130 --> 21:57.560
