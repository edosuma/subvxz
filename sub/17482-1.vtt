51:21.505 --> 51:22.802
"After extensive inquiries,

51:22.906 --> 51:25.170
"charges were never filed
as the evidence was considered

51:25.275 --> 51:26.936
purely circumstantial."

51:28.745 --> 51:30.804
Jesus.

51:30.914 --> 51:32.939
Does that look circumstantial to you?

51:33.050 --> 51:34.074
Absolutely not.

51:34.184 --> 51:35.708
The official story: "The Milburn guards

51:35.819 --> 51:36.877
were cleared of all charges."

51:36.987 --> 51:38.955
But they closed the place anyway.

51:39.056 --> 51:40.421
Yep.

51:43.193 --> 51:44.785
These books are from there.

51:44.895 --> 51:45.953
He's from there.

51:46.063 --> 51:47.553
Are you talking about Mr. Choose-it?

51:47.664 --> 51:49.097
How the hell do you know that, Fi?

51:49.199 --> 51:51.599
[sighs]

51:51.702 --> 51:53.636
I just know.

51:56.139 --> 51:58.471
Brian, thank you.

52:01.578 --> 52:03.705
So far, the pattern is no pattern.

52:03.814 --> 52:05.714
Hundred miles apart, male, female,

52:05.816 --> 52:07.909
different jobs, lifestyles.

52:08.018 --> 52:10.748
The latest DNA check on
the blood tells us what, Alice?

52:10.854 --> 52:12.981
Nothing matches the database so far.

52:13.090 --> 52:15.490
But the maze for Jenna Marlowe

52:15.592 --> 52:17.753
was drawn in Simon Campbell's blood.

52:17.861 --> 52:19.158
He appeared to know all of them,

52:19.263 --> 52:20.560
or at least knew facts about them.

52:20.664 --> 52:22.325
That simply tells us
that he stalked them.

52:22.432 --> 52:25.595
Well, we got to start thinking
about this in a whole new light,

52:25.702 --> 52:27.533
a different angle,
different possibilities.

52:27.638 --> 52:30.232
Maybe the victim isn't the target.

52:30.340 --> 52:32.001
Case in point, young Sara.

52:32.109 --> 52:35.601
What if she's the target
instead of her father?

52:35.712 --> 52:37.111
She brings the killer to the family.

52:37.214 --> 52:38.203
She feels responsible.

52:38.315 --> 52:39.748
She was forced to kill her own father

52:39.850 --> 52:41.408
in front of her mother and brother.

52:41.518 --> 52:43.509
I'm simply suggesting
that we examine this from--

52:43.620 --> 52:45.554
and by the way, when I say "we,"

52:45.656 --> 52:47.180
I'm of course referring to those of us

52:47.291 --> 52:49.088
involved in official police business.

52:49.192 --> 52:50.216
It is my business.

52:50.327 --> 52:53.091
He keeps making it my business.

52:53.196 --> 52:57.656
He just dropped these off
while I was in the library.

52:57.768 --> 52:59.531
We just tracked the same thing
a few hours ago,

52:59.636 --> 53:01.035
the same book, in fact.

53:01.138 --> 53:03.106
Yeah, but the real clue
is more where they came from,

53:03.206 --> 53:04.104
not what's in them.

53:04.207 --> 53:06.004
Fi, this is dangerous.

53:06.109 --> 53:07.872
What are you doing
holding on to this stuff?

53:07.978 --> 53:11.436
If he wanted to hurt me,
he would have already.

53:11.548 --> 53:13.516
Can't you see that he wants me
personally involved?

53:13.617 --> 53:14.948
He wants me to find out about him,

53:15.052 --> 53:16.246
probably to publicize his story.

53:16.353 --> 53:17.342
Okay, hold it a second.

53:17.454 --> 53:18.819
If he wants a story on the front page,

53:18.922 --> 53:20.856
he's got a dozen or so
working writers here in town.

53:20.957 --> 53:22.822
Hell, the Times is less
than a hundred miles away.

53:22.926 --> 53:24.018
No offense, but why you?

53:24.127 --> 53:27.153
Look, whatever the reason is,
he chose me.

53:28.932 --> 53:30.229
What have you got?

53:32.235 --> 53:35.102
These books are from Milburn
Juvenile Detention Center.

53:35.205 --> 53:36.570
These barcodes here prove that.

53:36.673 --> 53:37.901
They're actually Codabar,

53:38.008 --> 53:40.806
an old system that they used
back in the '70s.

53:40.911 --> 53:43.106
Milburn closed down
more than eight years ago.

53:43.213 --> 53:46.649
These books came from there,
so he came from there.

53:48.218 --> 53:49.276
Okay, good work.

53:49.386 --> 53:51.183
We'll check it out.

53:51.288 --> 53:52.550
But for now, everybody goes home,

53:52.656 --> 53:54.317
gets some sleep.

53:54.424 --> 53:56.415
Everybody.

54:09.573 --> 54:13.703
[keyboard clicking]

54:13.810 --> 54:17.678
You look so very at home sitting there.

54:17.781 --> 54:18.873
I am at home, Dad.

54:18.982 --> 54:20.449
But you know I can't stay here forever.

54:20.550 --> 54:22.279
Classes and a life, you know.

54:22.386 --> 54:23.876
Yes, I know.

54:23.987 --> 54:25.249
I made some eggs and bacon for you

54:25.355 --> 54:26.287
over there on the counter.

54:26.390 --> 54:27.857
Thank you. I saw that.

54:27.958 --> 54:29.983
I'm just saying it's nice
to see you here; that's all.

54:30.093 --> 54:31.355
And I'm sure you feel safer here.

54:31.461 --> 54:32.553
Yes, I feel safe.

54:34.865 --> 54:35.991
More coffee?

54:36.099 --> 54:37.293
Mm-hmm.

54:43.240 --> 54:44.434
Whoa.

54:45.776 --> 54:47.107
- Check this out.
- Well, I would.

54:47.210 --> 54:48.871
You have to make the screen
a little larger.

54:48.979 --> 54:50.241
I'm 107.

54:50.347 --> 54:52.542
All right, let me zoom in.

54:52.649 --> 54:53.741
Holy shit.

54:53.850 --> 54:55.442
Choice therapy?

54:55.552 --> 54:59.454
- Milburn.
- Milburn.

54:59.556 --> 55:01.717
You just kicked the police's ass
with your laptop.

55:01.825 --> 55:02.814
Is that how it works?

55:02.926 --> 55:05.053
Guess where I get it from.

55:05.162 --> 55:07.653
Well, everyone knows that.

55:07.764 --> 55:12.167
[keyboard clicking]

55:12.269 --> 55:13.827
Come on. Let's go.

55:13.937 --> 55:14.904
I'm gonna be late.

55:15.005 --> 55:16.302
Wait a minute. What?

55:16.406 --> 55:18.135
I emailed Benson.
He's digging up an address.

55:18.241 --> 55:19.333
He's gonna call us on the cell.

55:19.443 --> 55:22.139
You said "we." There can be no "we."

55:22.245 --> 55:24.110
Well, you can leave me here

55:24.214 --> 55:26.307
and keep guessing what I'm up to,

55:26.416 --> 55:29.351
or you can take me with you
and know for yourself.

55:29.453 --> 55:30.442
Yeah, fine. Go ahead.

55:30.554 --> 55:32.454
Get in the shower.

56:24.774 --> 56:26.332
Just for now, okay?

56:26.443 --> 56:27.467
Stay in the car.

56:27.577 --> 56:29.238
[door slams]

56:29.346 --> 56:30.608
Seriously?

56:31.781 --> 56:32.941
[gasps]

56:33.049 --> 56:35.517
Hi-dee-ho.

56:35.619 --> 56:37.746
Come on out.

56:37.854 --> 56:38.912
Scared me.

56:39.022 --> 56:40.387
Oh, sorry.

56:40.490 --> 56:41.548
That's okay.

56:41.658 --> 56:43.250
Dr. Ronald Pendleton.

56:43.360 --> 56:45.021
You already knew that.

56:45.128 --> 56:46.652
Nice to meet you, sir.

56:46.763 --> 56:48.355
You too.

56:48.465 --> 56:52.333
This-a-way we go.

56:52.435 --> 56:54.426
- Just try not to--
- Okay.

56:56.172 --> 56:58.834
Of course, this is in regards
to your work at Milburn.

56:58.942 --> 57:00.068
We've drawn a connection

57:00.176 --> 57:04.112
and hoping that someone
might come to mind,

57:04.214 --> 57:05.977
which is why we've come here,

57:06.082 --> 57:09.051
hoping you could narrow the field.

57:13.156 --> 57:16.125
Could be any one of these candidates.

57:16.226 --> 57:21.254
So the rumors, the abuse, was true.

57:21.364 --> 57:26.165
The facts say yes, but the state?

57:26.269 --> 57:27.998
No, ma'am.

57:28.104 --> 57:30.937
Right, sir, but if you
could answer the question--

57:31.041 --> 57:36.570
Oh, I propose that even if
you left here today with a name,

57:36.680 --> 57:38.045
you're no better off.

57:38.148 --> 57:40.378
And I propose you underestimate me.

57:40.483 --> 57:43.919
[laughing]

57:44.020 --> 57:45.920
I'm water. You're the horse.

57:46.022 --> 57:47.250
He brought you to me.

57:47.357 --> 57:50.758
The books? Milburn?

57:50.860 --> 57:52.054
He knows you're here.

57:52.162 --> 57:55.131
He wants you to be here.

57:55.231 --> 57:58.723
Under his terms, not yours.

57:58.835 --> 58:00.427
And it's safe to say your choice therapy

58:00.537 --> 58:02.630
wasn't exactly a cure-all
for one particular boy.

58:02.739 --> 58:06.766
Hey, I never said it was therapy.

58:06.876 --> 58:11.677
And I never, ever said that
it was any kind of a cure-all.

58:11.781 --> 58:13.874
It was more like a barometer

58:13.984 --> 58:17.886
about how the choices
that we make define us.

58:18.555 --> 58:23.583
What better way to understand
how the mind works

58:23.693 --> 58:29.393
than by analyzing
the most difficult choices

58:29.499 --> 58:33.435
we have to make?

58:33.536 --> 58:35.527
He chose you.

58:35.639 --> 58:37.869
That's interesting.

58:37.974 --> 58:39.271
So far that I can see,

58:39.376 --> 58:43.403
you're holding up
your part of the bargain.

58:43.513 --> 58:44.912
That's also interesting.

58:45.015 --> 58:47.916
Most people would have cut tail
and run by now.

58:48.018 --> 58:50.714
But not you.

58:50.820 --> 58:55.257
And he knows that.

58:55.358 --> 58:58.816
And I'll tell you something, detective.

58:58.928 --> 59:02.193
He's gonna catch you,

59:02.298 --> 59:06.758
and he's gonna catch you
way before you ever catch him.

59:18.648 --> 59:20.843
You believe this guy?

59:20.950 --> 59:25.319
[sighs]

59:27.657 --> 59:30.626
There you are.

59:30.727 --> 59:37.792
All you have to do is very
carefully look at the tapes.

59:37.901 --> 59:39.528
And you know what?

59:39.636 --> 59:45.370
He's gonna jump off that tape
and tell you exactly who he is.

59:45.475 --> 59:50.970
And there is no way
that you will ever stop him.

59:51.081 --> 59:54.073
Thank you, sir.

59:57.687 --> 59:58.984
Take care.

59:59.089 --> 01:00:00.454
Be careful.

01:00:04.461 --> 01:00:06.725
And you, sir?

01:00:06.830 --> 01:00:09.765
Be warned.

01:00:14.170 --> 01:00:16.104
The choice is now

01:00:16.206 --> 01:00:18.868
snap her neck and leave immediately,

01:00:18.975 --> 01:00:24.208
or stay here for another ten years.

01:00:24.314 --> 01:00:26.714
What's your answer now?

01:00:26.816 --> 01:00:28.249
I'd kill you before I'd kill this dog,

01:00:28.351 --> 01:00:32.082
you sick old fuck.

01:00:32.188 --> 01:00:34.088
I'm gonna reach over
and break your neck.

01:00:34.190 --> 01:00:36.681
Do I get the money then
or just another ten years?

01:00:36.793 --> 01:00:37.987
- That'll be all.
- Fuck you.

01:00:38.094 --> 01:00:40.255
See, this kid I like.

01:00:40.363 --> 01:00:41.261
[static hisses]

01:00:41.364 --> 01:00:42.296
That's done.

01:00:42.398 --> 01:00:45.333
Here's the last one.

01:00:47.303 --> 01:00:48.361
Yeah, I like her.

01:00:48.471 --> 01:00:50.837
Let me ask you a question.

01:00:50.940 --> 01:00:56.674
If I were to offer you $1,000
to snap her neck, would you?

01:00:56.780 --> 01:00:58.873
No.

01:00:58.982 --> 01:01:01.007
Are you sure?

01:01:01.117 --> 01:01:03.642
I wouldn't hurt Molly. Would I, girl?

01:01:03.753 --> 01:01:07.655
Just 'cause I'm in here doesn't
make me what you think I am.

01:01:07.757 --> 01:01:11.955
Let's make it $10,000.

01:01:12.061 --> 01:01:13.426
You're playing a game.

01:01:13.530 --> 01:01:14.588
I get it.

01:01:14.697 --> 01:01:17.188
A simple choice. Yes or no?

01:01:20.236 --> 01:01:22.204
No, I wouldn't.

01:01:22.305 --> 01:01:24.000
What if I informed you

01:01:24.107 --> 01:01:27.008
that she was scheduled
to be put down anyway

01:01:27.110 --> 01:01:29.135
later this afternoon at the pound?

01:01:29.245 --> 01:01:31.236
Nothing you can do to stop it.

01:01:31.347 --> 01:01:34.373
Then would you take the $10,000?

01:01:34.484 --> 01:01:36.213
No, I'm not a monster.

01:01:36.319 --> 01:01:38.753
$100,000?

01:01:38.855 --> 01:01:41.085
I said no. Now leave me alone.

01:01:41.191 --> 01:01:44.490
The choice is now.

01:01:44.594 --> 01:01:48.496
Snap her neck and leave immediately,

01:01:48.598 --> 01:01:53.331
or stay here for another ten years.

01:01:53.436 --> 01:01:56.200
Please choose.

01:01:58.808 --> 01:02:01.743
[puppy whimpers]

01:02:01.845 --> 01:02:03.472
[screaming] What have you done?

01:02:03.580 --> 01:02:05.309
My God! Jesus, stop the tape!

01:02:05.415 --> 01:02:06.507
So I guess I'm free to go.

01:02:06.616 --> 01:02:10.347
Stop the tape!

01:02:10.453 --> 01:02:12.114
Holy shit. What's that kid's name?

01:02:12.222 --> 01:02:15.089
Yeah, what is that kid's name?

01:02:15.191 --> 01:02:18.649
Uh, Nathan Jones.

01:02:18.761 --> 01:02:20.888
Nathan Jones?

01:02:23.800 --> 01:02:26.234
All right, adopted when he was
two months old.

01:02:26.336 --> 01:02:28.896
The adopted parents returned
the kid to child services

01:02:29.005 --> 01:02:30.199
when he was three years old.

01:02:30.306 --> 01:02:32.866
Mentally unstable. Destructive.

01:02:32.976 --> 01:02:34.568
How destructive can you be at three?

01:02:34.677 --> 01:02:37.168
I guess destructive enough
for the state to take him back.

01:02:37.280 --> 01:02:39.214
It's pretty goddamn destructive
for that to happen,

01:02:39.315 --> 01:02:40.373
don't you think, boss?

01:02:40.483 --> 01:02:41.973
Yeah, I never heard of that happening.

01:02:42.085 --> 01:02:44.315
Does it say anything else about
what happens to the kid next?
