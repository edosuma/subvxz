WEBVTT

00:09.000 --> 00:10.367
"SEVEN MINUTES IN HEAVEN"?

00:10.367 --> 00:12.767
THEY PICK A BOY
AND PICK A GIRL.

00:12.767 --> 00:15.600
THEY SEND YOU TWO
INTO A DARK CLOSET.

00:15.600 --> 00:17.000
HOW DO YOU FIND THE GIRL?

00:17.000 --> 00:18.200
WITH YOUR LIPS.

00:18.200 --> 00:20.367
I'M GOING TO LIKE
THIS GAME.

00:20.367 --> 00:21.600
IF THAT'S YOUR LUNCH,

00:21.600 --> 00:24.000
I DON'T THINK
THE GIRL WILL LIKE IT.

00:24.000 --> 00:26.300
NOBODY'S TALKING TO YOU.

00:26.300 --> 00:27.734
JUST TRYING TO HELP.

00:27.734 --> 00:30.467
CLOSET STRATEGY
IS THE KEY.

00:30.467 --> 00:32.367
YOU'VE ONLY GOT
SEVEN MINUTES.

00:32.367 --> 00:33.834
YOU HAVE TO MAKE
EVERY SECOND...

00:34.967 --> 00:36.600
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

00:36.600 --> 00:39.033
LIP-UPS.
I WANT TO BE IN SHAPE.

00:39.033 --> 00:40.700
I WANT TO GO
THE DISTANCE.

00:40.700 --> 00:43.500
TICK, TICK, TICK, TICK.

00:43.500 --> 00:44.467
WHAT?

00:44.467 --> 00:45.800
TIME BOMB.

00:45.800 --> 00:48.300
JUST IGNORE HIM.

00:48.300 --> 00:50.667
PLEASE.
HE'S JUST PLAYING
SOME GAME,

00:50.667 --> 00:52.233
BUT IT DOESN'T WORK.

00:52.233 --> 00:54.133
NEVER HAS, NEVER WILL.

01:00.100 --> 01:01.734
GEORGE.
GEORGE, GEORGE.

01:01.734 --> 01:02.734
WHAT?

01:02.734 --> 01:03.767
WHO DAT?

01:03.767 --> 01:05.600
DON'T LOOK.
DON'T LOOK.

01:08.867 --> 01:10.133
NOW.

01:10.133 --> 01:13.367
MR. TURNER, WE ARE NOT
IN HIGH SCHOOL.

01:13.367 --> 01:15.000
WELL, YES, WE ARE,

01:15.000 --> 01:17.934
BUT WE'RE TEACHERS,
YOU FOOL.

01:21.934 --> 01:24.834
TEACH ME ABOUT HER.

01:24.834 --> 01:26.767
UH, THAT'S
MISS TOMPKINS.

01:26.767 --> 01:28.734
SHE REPLACED
EDWINA MUNCEE

01:28.734 --> 01:31.000
IN OUR SOCIAL STUDIES
DEPARTMENT...

01:31.000 --> 01:32.867
MERCIFULLY.

01:32.867 --> 01:34.367
DID YOU HIRE HER,
GEORGE?

01:34.367 --> 01:35.600
YES, I DID.

01:35.600 --> 01:38.300
ATTABOY.

01:38.300 --> 01:40.900
TAKE A SHOWER, SON.

01:40.900 --> 01:43.000
YOU SAID MISS,
NOT MS. OR MRS.

01:43.000 --> 01:44.200
THAT WAS AN "ISS"

01:44.200 --> 01:46.800
AS IN "ISS" MUST BE
MY LUCKY DAY.

01:46.800 --> 01:48.467
SHE IS INDEED SINGLE.

01:48.467 --> 01:50.400
SHE IS ALSO HIGHLY
INTELLIGENT.

01:50.400 --> 01:51.600
THAT'S O.K.

01:51.600 --> 01:53.800
MR. TURNER, I FROWN

01:53.800 --> 01:57.367
UPON FACULTY
BECOMING INVOLVED
WITH FACULTY.

01:57.367 --> 01:59.100
THEN IT'S NOT A POLICY.

01:59.100 --> 02:01.400
IT'S JUST
A FACIAL EXPRESSION.

02:01.400 --> 02:03.033
GO AHEAD.
SKIP BLITHELY

02:03.033 --> 02:06.300
INTO THE MINEFIELD
OF EXTRACURRICULAR ROMANCE.

02:06.300 --> 02:08.000
THANKS.

02:08.000 --> 02:11.600
I'M JUST GOING
OVER TO SAY HI,
WELCOME HER.

02:11.600 --> 02:13.033
HOW'S MY HAIR?

02:13.033 --> 02:14.033
LONG.

02:16.000 --> 02:17.000
CORY.

02:17.000 --> 02:18.000
WHAT?

02:18.000 --> 02:19.100
WHAT ERIC SAID,

02:19.100 --> 02:21.500
IT'S NOT BOTHERING YOU,
IS IT?

02:21.500 --> 02:22.767
NO, NOT AT ALL.

02:22.767 --> 02:25.233
IN FACT, I'M GOING
OVER THERE RIGHT NOW

02:25.233 --> 02:27.467
AND TELL HIM HOW MUCH
IT'S NOT BOTHERING ME.

02:31.200 --> 02:32.300
HI.

02:32.300 --> 02:34.100
CORY, WHAT A SURPRISE.

02:35.300 --> 02:36.734
WHAT TIME BOMB, ERIC?

02:36.734 --> 02:39.000
YOU CAN'T
JUST WALK BY AND GO,
"TICK, TICK, TICK."

02:39.000 --> 02:40.900
WHAT'S THAT MEAN?

02:40.900 --> 02:44.200
I'M CONCERNED
YOU'RE NOT PREPARED
FOR THE MAKE-OUT PARTY.

02:44.200 --> 02:45.934
I KNOW HOW TO KISS.

02:45.934 --> 02:48.567
YOU THINK
IT'S THAT SIMPLE?

02:48.567 --> 02:50.800
WHAT HAPPENS
IF SHE HAS BRACES?

02:50.800 --> 02:53.100
WHAT HAPPENS
IF YOUR NOSES HIT?

02:53.100 --> 02:55.133
WHAT IF A HANGER HOOKS YOU
LIKE A LARGEMOUTH BASS?

02:56.867 --> 02:58.600
DO YOU EVEN KNOW
WHAT TO DO
WITH YOUR HANDS?

02:58.600 --> 02:59.600
NO!

03:01.400 --> 03:03.400
IS--IS
THAT IMPORTANT?

03:03.400 --> 03:06.033
SOME THINGS YOU CAN LEARN,
BUT SOME THINGS...

03:06.033 --> 03:08.500
IT'S ALREADY TOO LATE.

03:08.500 --> 03:09.734
I'VE GOT TIME.

03:09.734 --> 03:12.500
YOU ATE THE BEENIE-WEENIE
CASSEROLE.

03:12.500 --> 03:14.200
TICK...TICK.

03:14.200 --> 03:16.133
OH, MY GOSH.

03:16.133 --> 03:17.800
WHY IS THAT BAD?

03:17.800 --> 03:20.500
DEEP DOWN
DOES THE THOUGHT
OF KISSING SOMEBODY

03:20.500 --> 03:22.033
MAKE YOU TENSE UP?

03:22.033 --> 03:23.767
ABSOLUTELY NOT.

03:23.767 --> 03:24.867
O.K., THEN.

03:26.600 --> 03:28.934
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.
I WOULDN'T SAY TENSE UP.

03:28.934 --> 03:31.900
I WOULD SAY
I BECOME VERY ALERT.

03:31.900 --> 03:35.700
SO YOU'LL BE THERE
AT THE MAKE-OUT PARTY
VERY ALERT,

03:35.700 --> 03:37.667
YOUR INTESTINES
FULL OF BEENIE-WEENIE.

03:38.767 --> 03:41.200
YOU LEAN IN FOR A KISS,

03:41.200 --> 03:42.400
AND YOU FLY
ACROSS THE ROOM.

03:44.200 --> 03:45.567
[PSSSST]

03:51.300 --> 03:54.467
GREAT. ALL THE GIRLS
BROUGHT THEIR LIPS.

03:54.467 --> 03:57.200
SHAWN, THERE'S A GIRL
WITH BRACES.

03:57.200 --> 03:58.233
WHAT IF I GET HER?

03:58.233 --> 03:59.600
SHE COULD CUT MY TONGUE,

03:59.600 --> 04:03.500
AND I'LL BLEED
ALL OVER MY SHIRT.

04:03.500 --> 04:05.934
SALLY'S WEARING WOOL.
I'M ALLERGIC.

04:05.934 --> 04:08.600
WHAT IF SNEEZE IN HER MOUTH
AND POP HER LUNGS?

04:08.600 --> 04:10.133
RELAX, MAN.

04:10.133 --> 04:11.300
HAVE A SNACK.

04:11.300 --> 04:13.567
CARBO LOAD
FOR THE BIG RACE.

04:13.567 --> 04:17.300
WITH BEAN DIP?
ARE YOU OUT
OF YOUR MIND?

04:17.300 --> 04:19.767
WHAT ARE YOU WORRIED
ABOUT, YOUR BREATH?

04:19.767 --> 04:23.567
MY BREATH.
I DIDN'T EVEN
THINK ABOUT THAT.

04:23.567 --> 04:25.100
OH, MAN.

04:25.100 --> 04:26.967
I'M GOING TO KILL THEM
COMING AND GOING.

04:26.967 --> 04:28.600
I'LL BLOW US BOTH
OUT OF THE CLOSET.

04:28.600 --> 04:29.767
I'M GETTING OUT OF HERE.

04:29.767 --> 04:31.200
HI, CORY.

04:31.200 --> 04:32.400
HI, TOPANGA.

04:34.000 --> 04:35.600
WHAT A GREAT PARTY,
HUH?

04:35.600 --> 04:38.500
I WAS IN THE CLOSET
14 MINUTES.

04:38.500 --> 04:41.100
I'M GOING HOME
AND ICE MY LIPS.

04:41.100 --> 04:42.734
CORY!

04:42.734 --> 04:45.500
ERIC WAS RIGHT.
TOO MUCH CAN GO WRONG.

04:45.500 --> 04:48.700
CORY, CHILL.
YOU'RE GOING TO BE FINE.

04:48.700 --> 04:49.800
AND YOU KNOW WHY?

04:49.800 --> 04:52.100
RIGHT UP UNTIL YOU GO
INTO THAT CLOSET,

04:52.100 --> 04:54.500
I'M RIGHT HERE
WITH YOU,
NO MATTER WHAT,

04:54.500 --> 04:57.900
'CAUSE IT'S
CORY AND SHAWN,
SHAWN AND CORY.

04:57.900 --> 04:59.100
SHAWN AND MELANIE.

04:59.100 --> 05:00.200
SEE YA.

05:05.734 --> 05:07.300
ALL RIGHT, KIDS.
NOW TIME'S UP.

05:08.900 --> 05:10.967
COME ON, COME ON.
NO OVERTIME.

05:10.967 --> 05:12.500
NO EXTRA INNINGS.

05:16.667 --> 05:19.000
IS THAT THE SHIRT
YOU WENT IN WITH?

05:19.000 --> 05:21.667
HEH HEH HEH. NO.

05:23.734 --> 05:26.300
CORY, THE CLOSET
IS YOUR FRIEND.

05:26.300 --> 05:29.200
IT'S YOUR FRIEND, SHAWN.
I'M GOING TO CHOKE.

05:29.200 --> 05:32.033
WHO WILL BE NEXT?
COULD IT BE
CORY AND...

05:32.033 --> 05:34.000
MAYBE HE'LL
PICK ME TWICE,

05:34.000 --> 05:35.900
AND I'LL GO
INTO THE CLOSET
WITH MYSELF.

05:35.900 --> 05:37.200
TOPANGA!

05:39.033 --> 05:40.100
CORY?

05:40.100 --> 05:41.200
HUH?

05:41.200 --> 05:42.400
ARE YOU O.K.?

05:42.400 --> 05:43.600
IT'S BEEN A COUPLE
OF MINUTES,

05:43.600 --> 05:44.900
AND YOU HAVEN'T
SAID ANYTHING.

05:44.900 --> 05:47.033
THIS IS STUPID.
IT'S PITCH BLACK.

05:47.033 --> 05:50.100
HOW CAN I KISS YOU
IF I CAN'T SEE YOU?

05:50.100 --> 05:51.367
HI.

05:52.467 --> 05:53.400
HI.

05:55.700 --> 05:57.934
THIS IS CRAZY.
HOW AM I SUPPOSED
TO KISS YOU

05:57.934 --> 05:59.800
WITH THIS
BLINDING LIGHT
IN MY EYES?

05:59.800 --> 06:03.200
WE DON'T HAVE
TO DO ANYTHING
YOU DON'T WANT.

06:03.200 --> 06:07.567
I WANT TO DO
WHAT EVERYONE ELSE
IS DOING.

06:07.567 --> 06:10.300
YOU'RE DOING THIS
SO YOU WON'T
BE DIFFERENT?

06:10.300 --> 06:12.400
I'M JUST TRYING
TO SURVIVE THIS.

06:14.700 --> 06:16.667
IT'S NOT YOU,
TOPANGA. IT'S ME.

06:16.667 --> 06:19.367
I JUST CAN'T PERFORM
UNDER ALL THIS PRESSURE.

06:19.367 --> 06:22.600
IT'S O.K. RELAX.
THIS HAPPENS
TO LOTS OF GUYS.

06:22.600 --> 06:24.700
HOW DO YOU KNOW?

06:24.700 --> 06:27.100
WELL, YOU KNOW,
GIRLS TALK.

06:27.100 --> 06:29.000
OH, MAN.

06:29.000 --> 06:31.867
LISTEN, WHEN YOU TALK
TO GIRLS,

06:31.867 --> 06:34.400
THIS DID NOT HAPPEN
TO ME.

06:34.400 --> 06:35.467
NOTHING HAPPENED.

06:35.467 --> 06:38.100
I MEAN,
SOMETHING HAPPENED,
BUT...

06:38.100 --> 06:40.700
WHATEVER WAS SUPPOSED
TO HAPPEN DID.

06:40.700 --> 06:43.033
CORY, YOU WANT
TO JUST TALK?

06:43.033 --> 06:44.767
COULD WE?

06:44.767 --> 06:48.467
SO, WHAT WOULD YOU
LIKE TO TALK ABOUT?

06:48.467 --> 06:51.500
WE COULD TALK ABOUT
WHAT WE'RE GOING
TO TELL THEM

06:51.500 --> 06:52.834
WHEN WE GET OUT OF HERE.

06:52.834 --> 06:54.300
WE COULD TELL THEM
WE MADE OUT.

06:55.600 --> 06:56.700
THEY'D KNOW.

06:56.700 --> 06:57.967
I COULD
MESS UP MY HAIR,

06:57.967 --> 06:59.300
AND YOU COULD
CHANGE YOUR SHIRT.

06:59.300 --> 07:02.133
YOU'D HAVE TO SMILE.

07:02.133 --> 07:05.500
YOU'D HAVE TO GET
THAT REAL SLEEPY
STUPID LOOK.

07:05.500 --> 07:07.700
YOU COULD CHANGE
YOUR SHIRT, TOO.

07:07.700 --> 07:09.834
DON'T PUSH IT.

07:12.100 --> 07:14.667
HOW COME
YOU'RE BEING SO COOL
ABOUT THIS?

07:14.667 --> 07:18.400
I DON'T KNOW.
BECAUSE YOU'RE NICE.

07:18.400 --> 07:20.400
GREAT.
TWIST THE KNIFE.

07:20.400 --> 07:21.934
IT WAS A COMPLIMENT.

07:21.934 --> 07:24.467
GUYS DON'T WANT
TO BE NICE.

07:24.467 --> 07:26.900
WE WANT TO BE,
YOU KNOW...

07:26.900 --> 07:31.100
TOUGH AND GOOD
WITH APPLIANCES

07:31.100 --> 07:33.300
AND GOOD KISSERS.

07:33.300 --> 07:36.567
WELL, THERE'S REALLY
ONLY ONE WAY

07:36.567 --> 07:37.567
TO BE A GOOD KISSER.

07:37.567 --> 07:40.200
YOU HAVE TO PRACTICE.

07:40.200 --> 07:41.800
YOU THINK?

07:41.800 --> 07:43.000
YEAH.

07:43.000 --> 07:45.834
SO WE CAN EITHER
START MESSING UP
OUR CLOTHES

07:45.834 --> 07:47.867
AND TRYING
TO LOOK STUPID,

07:47.867 --> 07:49.233
OR...

07:49.233 --> 07:51.300
YOU COULD JUST RELAX
AND KISS ME.

07:51.300 --> 07:52.734
I COULD PRACTICE
AND HOUR A DAY--

07:52.734 --> 07:54.100
SHH!

07:58.367 --> 08:01.100
TIME'S UP.
LET'S TAKE A LOOK
AT THEM.

08:08.600 --> 08:13.233
SO DID YOU KISS
ANYBODY TONIGHT?

08:13.233 --> 08:15.033
MOM.

08:15.033 --> 08:16.300
AMY, WHOA.

08:16.300 --> 08:18.000
STEP AWAY FROM
YOUR SON, PLEASE.

08:18.000 --> 08:20.133
YOU CAN'T DO THAT
TO A GUY.

08:20.133 --> 08:22.867
HE'S NOT A GUY.
HE'S MY BABY.

08:22.867 --> 08:26.367
PLEASE HAVE MERCY
ON THE BOY,
WILL YOU?

08:26.367 --> 08:30.133
DO YOU WANT
GRANDCHILDREN, HUH?

08:30.133 --> 08:32.100
WELL, THEN
DON'T TALK LIKE THAT
TO YOUR SON.

08:32.100 --> 08:33.400
GET OUT OF HERE.

08:33.400 --> 08:35.400
GIVE THE BOY
SOME PRIVACY.

08:35.400 --> 08:37.300
LATER, YOU AND ME,
DETAILS.

08:39.767 --> 08:42.567
SO, STUDLY,
WHAT HAPPENED?
TELL ME.

08:42.567 --> 08:43.767
YOU GOT A MINUTE?

08:43.767 --> 08:44.767
YEAH.

08:44.767 --> 08:46.300
YOU WON'T NEED IT.

08:46.300 --> 08:47.300
NOTHING?

08:47.300 --> 08:48.567
LESS THAN.

08:48.567 --> 08:51.133
SO ARE YOU THE ONLY GUY
THAT DIDN'T MAKE OUT?

08:51.133 --> 08:53.800
WELL, ALVIN HAD A ROUSING
ASTHMA ATTACK

08:53.800 --> 08:56.300
AND HAD TO LEAVE EARLY,

08:56.300 --> 08:59.900
BUT OTHER THAN HIM,
THE CHEESE STOOD ALONE.

08:59.900 --> 09:02.567
COR, I WANT TO SAY

09:02.567 --> 09:05.867
THAT IN THIS,
THE DARKEST HOUR
OF YOUR YOUTH,

09:05.867 --> 09:07.700
I'M TRYING VERY HARD
NOT TO LAUGH.

09:10.800 --> 09:13.467
NOPE, CAN'T DO IT.

09:13.467 --> 09:15.100
ERIC,
IT WAS A HUGE PARTY.

09:15.100 --> 09:16.700
THERE WAS A LOT GOING ON.

09:16.700 --> 09:18.300
I'M SURE
NO ONE EVEN NOTICED.

09:18.300 --> 09:19.400
UH-HUH.

09:19.400 --> 09:22.600
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
THE AMAZING LIPLESS!

09:25.867 --> 09:27.600
I'M O.K.
LIFE GOES ON.

09:27.600 --> 09:31.200
HERE, DRIVE THIS
THROUGH MY BRAIN.

09:31.200 --> 09:33.467
IT'S O.K., COR.
ONLY A FEW GUYS KNOW.

09:33.467 --> 09:36.100
IT'S NOT LIKE
THEY'RE GOING TO TELL
EVERYBODY.

09:36.100 --> 09:37.600
YEAH. NOBODY ELSE
WILL KNOW.

09:37.600 --> 09:42.800
HEY, CORY, LISTEN,
UH, IF YOU EVER NEED
TO TALK ABOUT,

09:42.800 --> 09:44.200
YOU KNOW, ANYTHING,

09:44.200 --> 09:45.600
I'M ALWAYS
AVAILABLE, O.K.?

09:50.500 --> 09:53.967
I'VE SUNK SO LOW
THAT EVEN TEACHERS
FEEL SORRY FOR ME.

09:53.967 --> 09:55.800
IN SITUATIONS LIKE THIS,

09:55.800 --> 09:58.133
IT'S LIKE
MY UNCLE RALPH ALWAYS SAYS,

09:58.133 --> 10:00.834
"IT'S NOT WHAT YOU DID.
IT'S WHAT THEY CAN PIN
ON YOU."

10:00.834 --> 10:02.767
YOU'RE SAYING I SHOULD--

10:02.767 --> 10:04.500
DENY EVERYTHING.

10:04.500 --> 10:07.600
YOU WERE IN A CLOSET.
WHO ELSE KNOWS
WHAT HAPPENED?

10:07.600 --> 10:09.300
JUST BECAUSE
HE DIDN'T KISS ME

10:09.300 --> 10:11.567
DOESN'T MEAN
HE'S SOME KIND
OF A FREAK.

10:11.567 --> 10:14.400
NO. NO!
MAKE HER STOP.

10:14.400 --> 10:18.934
ANY GUY CAN JUST
CRAWL IN A CLOSET
AND KISS A GIRL,

10:18.934 --> 10:20.967
BUT CORY'S
A REALLY NICE BOY.

10:26.400 --> 10:28.033
WELL,
I'M A "NICE" BOY, SHAWN,

10:28.033 --> 10:30.200
AND NOW
EVERYBODY KNOWS IT.

10:30.200 --> 10:31.700
HEY, BABOON.

10:31.700 --> 10:34.600
I'LL JUST BE
OVER HERE.

10:34.600 --> 10:36.000
OVER HERE.

10:37.900 --> 10:40.867
THERE'S AN
INSPIRATIONAL THOUGHT
I'D LIKE TO SHARE.

10:40.867 --> 10:43.600
I CRIED BECAUSE
I HAD NO SHOES

10:43.600 --> 10:46.567
UNTIL I MET A BOY
WHO HAD NO LIPS.

10:47.734 --> 10:49.100
THAT'S A GOOD ONE.

10:49.100 --> 10:51.734
I'LL BE LAUGHING
AT THAT ONE
FOR YEARS AND YEARS.

10:51.734 --> 10:54.934
I'LL BE TELLING
MY GRANDKIDS
ABOUT IT,

10:54.934 --> 10:56.834
UNLESS I DON'T HAVE
GRANDKIDS.

10:56.834 --> 10:57.967
THEN
I'LL HAVE TO TELL
STRANGE KIDS.

10:57.967 --> 10:59.934
SHUT UP!

10:59.934 --> 11:03.567
CORY'S DEPRESSED.
JUST LEAVE HIM
ALONE.

11:03.567 --> 11:06.367
OVER HERE.

11:06.367 --> 11:10.000
WHY DO YOU EVEN CARE
ABOUT NOTHINGS LIKE US?

11:10.000 --> 11:11.200
'CAUSE YOU
SEVENTH GRADERS

11:11.200 --> 11:13.200
ARE MY LITTLE
ANT FARM.

11:13.200 --> 11:15.567
I WATCH YOU WORK
AND PLAY

11:15.567 --> 11:18.100
AND RUN THROUGH
YOUR TINY TUNNELS.

11:18.100 --> 11:20.300
WHEN I HEAR
THAT ONE OF MY ANTS

11:20.300 --> 11:23.800
IS GETTING HIS LEGS
RIPPED OFF,
I CAN'T MISS THAT.

11:23.800 --> 11:27.200
AND HERE I THOUGHT
MY LIFE HAD NO MEANING.

11:27.200 --> 11:29.867
GLAD WE COULD
BRIGHTEN YOUR DAY.

11:32.300 --> 11:35.100
SO, MISS TOMPKINS,
EVERYONE MAKING YOU
FEEL WELCOME HERE

11:35.100 --> 11:36.500
YOUR FIRST WEEK?

11:36.500 --> 11:38.767
SOME MORE THAN OTHERS.

11:38.767 --> 11:40.400
THIS JONATHAN TURNER GUY,

11:40.400 --> 11:41.834
WHAT'S THE DEAL WITH HIM?

11:41.834 --> 11:45.200
IT'S NOT MY PLACE
TO COMMENT ON ONE
TEACHER TO ANOTHER.

11:45.200 --> 11:46.767
HE ASKED ME OUT.

11:46.767 --> 11:50.867
I JUST WANT TO KNOW
IF HE'S AN AX MURDERER.

11:50.867 --> 11:52.467
IT WASN'T ON HIS RÉSUMÉ.

11:52.467 --> 11:54.934
I'M WONDERING.
IS HE THE SAFE, SANE TYPE,

11:54.934 --> 11:58.900
OR IS HE MORE
OF A DANGEROUS
REBEL LONER?

11:58.900 --> 12:02.767
IF PRESSED, I'D SAY
HE'S MORE OF THE LATTER.

12:02.767 --> 12:03.967
EXCELLENT.

12:03.967 --> 12:08.133
AS MUCH OF A REBEL LONER
AS ONE CAN BE

12:08.133 --> 12:10.100
LIVING WITH SEVEN
MAIDEN AUNTS

12:10.100 --> 12:11.567
ABOVE THEIR LACE
AND LINEN SHOP.

12:11.567 --> 12:14.467
COME ON,
HE'S A WILD THING.

12:14.467 --> 12:16.200
HE IS EXTREMELY
CAUTIOUS.

12:16.200 --> 12:18.233
HE ALWAYS WEARS
HIS HELMET

12:18.233 --> 12:20.400
WHEN HE'S ON
HIS MOTORCYCLE.

12:20.400 --> 12:23.600
IS THAT HIS HARLEY
IN THE FACULTY
PARKING LOT?

12:23.600 --> 12:25.834
NO, IT'S MINE.

12:27.100 --> 12:29.867
THANK YOU, MR. FEENY.
YOU'VE BEEN SO HELPFUL.

12:29.867 --> 12:31.600
BELIEVE ME,
IT WAS UNINTENTIONAL.

12:31.600 --> 12:33.734
DON'T WORRY.
WE'RE JUST HAVING DINNER.

12:33.734 --> 12:36.400
IF IT WORKS OUT,
I OWE IT ALL TO YOU.

12:41.200 --> 12:43.300
I'M NEVER GOING BACK
TO SCHOOL AGAIN.

12:43.300 --> 12:46.133
I DON'T WANT
TO DISCUSS IT.

12:46.133 --> 12:47.400
ALL RIGHT.

12:47.400 --> 12:49.100
SO NOAH
HAD HIS PASTE CUP

12:49.100 --> 12:51.500
AND REACHED OVER
AND TOOK YOUR
PASTE CUP?

12:51.500 --> 12:52.567
AND HE ATE IT.

12:52.567 --> 12:53.767
AND MRS. BROOKHOLDER
WOULDN'T GIVE YOU

12:53.767 --> 12:55.200
ANOTHER PASTE CUP?

12:55.200 --> 12:56.900
NO. SHE'S A WITCH.

12:58.000 --> 12:59.600
SWEETHEART,
IN THE FUTURE--

12:59.600 --> 13:02.867
MY HIGH SCHOOL CAREER
CRASHED AND BURNED
TODAY,

13:02.867 --> 13:05.300
AND YOU'D RATHER TALK
ABOUT PASTE.

13:05.300 --> 13:08.667
WOULD YOU LIKE
TO DISCUSS IT NOW?

13:08.667 --> 13:12.000
I CHOKED AT A
MAKE-OUT PARTY, O.K.?

13:12.000 --> 13:13.900
ERIC WARNED ME
I'D CHOKE.

13:13.900 --> 13:15.700
LIKE AN IDIOT,
I WENT ANYWAY.

13:15.700 --> 13:19.300
YOUR FIRST PARTIES
WITH GIRLS ARE ALWAYS
A LITTLE AWKWARD.

13:19.300 --> 13:22.100
AWKWARD?
MOM, THIS WASN'T
AWKWARD.

13:22.100 --> 13:24.767
LOSING YOUR GYM SHORTS
WHILE CLIMBING THE ROPE,

13:24.767 --> 13:26.033
THAT IS AWKWARD...

13:27.767 --> 13:29.700
AND BURNS.

13:29.700 --> 13:34.200
THIS WAS BEYOND
HUMILIATION,
WAY BEYOND.

13:34.200 --> 13:35.300
THIS WAS--

13:35.300 --> 13:39.233
THIS WAS...
AGOOBWAH.

13:39.233 --> 13:41.367
AGOOBWAH?

13:41.367 --> 13:43.834
IT WAS SO BAD
I HAD TO INVENT
A WORD.

13:43.834 --> 13:45.734
ERIC SAID I'D CHOKE.

13:45.734 --> 13:48.367
BUT DID I LISTEN? NO.

13:48.367 --> 13:51.600
ASIDE FROM AGOOBWAH,

13:51.600 --> 13:54.233
THE KEY WORD
IN ALL OF THIS
SEEMS TO BE "ERIC."

13:54.233 --> 13:56.834
OH, SO YOU
NOTICED THAT, TOO?

13:59.000 --> 14:00.900
WHAT'S WITH COR?
I THINK HE SNAPPED.

14:02.000 --> 14:03.967
I'M GOING TO GO NOW.

14:03.967 --> 14:06.500
WHAT DID YOU SAY
TO CORY
BEFORE HIS PARTY?

14:06.500 --> 14:10.500
I PROBABLY SAID,
"HAVE A GOOD TIME.
THANK YOUR HOSTESS."

14:10.500 --> 14:13.133
WE WANT TO KNOW
WHAT YOU SAID

14:13.133 --> 14:15.200
SO WE KNOW
WHAT TO SAY

14:15.200 --> 14:16.767
TO MAKE HIM
FEEL BETTER.

14:16.767 --> 14:20.800
O.K. TOLD HIM
HOW SCARY IT'D BE
TO KISS A GIRL.

14:20.800 --> 14:22.033
AND HE BOUGHT IT?

14:22.033 --> 14:25.000
HE TOTALLY FREAKED.
I WAS JUST PLAYING
WITH HIS HEAD.

14:25.000 --> 14:28.600
MAN, YOU ARE IN
SUCH TROUBLE.

14:28.600 --> 14:30.400
YOU SAID BEFORE
THAT I WASN'T--

14:30.400 --> 14:32.667
I WAS JUST PLAYING
WITH YOUR HEAD.

14:32.667 --> 14:33.800
SIT DOWN!

14:33.800 --> 14:36.467
YOU KNOW, ERIC,
CORY SOUNDS SO UPSET,

14:36.467 --> 14:39.200
HE WON'T FEEL LIKE
GOING OUT WITH GIRLS
FOR A LONG TIME.

14:39.200 --> 14:42.233
YOU SHOULD STAY HOME
WITH HIM.

14:42.233 --> 14:44.567
I'M JUST COMING INTO
MY DATING PRIME.

14:44.567 --> 14:48.200
IF I WERE YOU,
I'D LOOK FOR OTHER
INTERESTS,

14:48.200 --> 14:49.767
HOMEBOUND
ACTIVITIES,
MY FRIEND.

14:49.767 --> 14:52.300
UNTIL CORY
FEELS LIKE
GOING OUT,

14:52.300 --> 14:54.700
I DON'T SEE YOU
GOING OUT, EITHER.

14:56.000 --> 14:58.200
I'M TOO CUTE
TO STAY HOME.

15:01.500 --> 15:03.734
HEY, COR.
HOW YOU DOING?

15:03.734 --> 15:05.200
JUST DANDY.

15:05.200 --> 15:07.734
SITTING HERE
PLANNING OUT
THE REST OF MY LIFE

15:07.734 --> 15:09.500
AS A "NICE" BOY.

15:09.500 --> 15:13.467
I MAY HAVE SLIGHTLY
EXAGGERATED THE DANGERS
IN KISSING A GIRL.

15:13.467 --> 15:15.600
FORGET IT.
I'LL NEVER DATE AGAIN.

15:15.600 --> 15:19.000
YOU HAVE TO DATE AGAIN
REAL SOON.

15:19.000 --> 15:21.367
WHAT'S IT TO YOU?

15:21.367 --> 15:25.000
YOU'RE MY LITTLE BROTHER.
YOUR PAIN IS MY PAIN.

15:25.000 --> 15:27.467
IF YOU'RE SITTING AT HOME
ON A SATURDAY NIGHT,

15:27.467 --> 15:30.667
IT'S LIKE
I'M SITTING AT HOME
ON A SATURDAY NIGHT.

15:30.667 --> 15:32.734
YOU GOT TO GET
BACK OUT THERE, MAN.

15:32.734 --> 15:34.734
I'M NOT READY.

15:34.734 --> 15:36.133
DID YOU FEEL READY

15:36.133 --> 15:37.600
WHEN DAD TOOK
THE TRAINING WHEELS
OFF YOUR BIKE?

15:37.600 --> 15:39.467
NO. AND I WASN'T.

15:39.467 --> 15:43.033
I LOST SIX TEETH
AND SCRAPED OFF
HALF MY FACE.

15:43.033 --> 15:44.934
EXACTLY MY POINT.

15:44.934 --> 15:47.667
YOU JUST NEEDED
YOUR TRAINING WHEELS ON
A LITTLE LONGER.

15:47.667 --> 15:48.967
YOU NEED
A NO-PRESSURE DATE

15:48.967 --> 15:50.300
TO RESTORE
YOUR CONFIDENCE.

15:50.300 --> 15:52.767
THERE'S NO SUCH THING.

15:52.767 --> 15:54.834
I'LL TAKE YOU AND A GIRL
SOMEPLACE SO UNROMANTIC

15:54.834 --> 15:56.967
NOBODY WILL WANT
TO KISS ANYBODY.

15:56.967 --> 15:58.934
<i>YOU'RE </i>GOING TO TAKE ME?

15:58.934 --> 16:00.100
WHY?

16:00.100 --> 16:02.100
YOU'RE MY LITTLE BROTHER,
REMEMBER?

16:02.100 --> 16:03.867
YOUR PAIN, MY PAIN?

16:05.667 --> 16:08.500
FINE.
BUT WHO DO I TAKE?

16:08.500 --> 16:10.500
NO ONE'S TALKING TO ME
BUT SHAWN AND TOPANGA.

16:10.500 --> 16:11.667
TAKE SHAWN.

16:11.667 --> 16:13.300
NO. TOPANGA.

16:13.300 --> 16:14.600
YOU ANIMAL.

16:26.200 --> 16:27.867
SO WHAT DO YOU DO
AT THIS PLACE?

16:27.867 --> 16:30.100
THEY DRINK COFFEE,
AND THEY READ POETRY.

16:30.100 --> 16:32.500
YOU CAN'T POSSIBLY
GET INTO TROUBLE.

16:32.500 --> 16:33.400
GOOD LUCK.

16:37.033 --> 16:43.800
HEY, LOOK.
THEY'VE GOT, UM,
CAP-NEW-CINO.

16:43.800 --> 16:46.734
I'D LOVE
A DOUBLE DECAF LATTÉ
WITH SKIM MILK.

16:46.734 --> 16:49.734
CLEARLY,
YOU HAVE KNOWLEDGE
OF OTHER WORLDS.

16:49.734 --> 16:53.100
I'LL GO FIND US
SOMEPLACE TO SIT.

16:53.100 --> 16:54.600
[APPLAUSE]

16:56.767 --> 16:59.200
THIS IS FOR
ALL MY FRIENDS

16:59.200 --> 17:02.900
WHO CHOOSE TO REMAIN
ANONYMOUS.

17:02.900 --> 17:03.834
AHEM.

17:05.133 --> 17:08.100
<i>"POEM OF THE FIERCE </i>
<i>AND BLOODTHIRSTY </i>

17:08.100 --> 17:09.367
<i>SAMURAI WARRIOR." </i>

17:10.767 --> 17:12.967
"THE CHERRY TREES

17:12.967 --> 17:14.700
"ON THE THIRD EVENING,

17:20.500 --> 17:21.867
THANK YOU.

17:23.934 --> 17:25.734
HEY, FRANKIE,
THAT WAS
REALLY GOOD.

17:25.734 --> 17:28.400
YOU STARTED SLOW,
BUT YOU GOT THEM
BY THE END.

17:28.400 --> 17:30.133
LET'S GO.

17:30.133 --> 17:32.600
I GOT A LOT
OUT OF THAT

17:32.600 --> 17:35.300
'CAUSE YOU PUT
A LOT INTO IT.

17:35.300 --> 17:37.300
HEY, DIDN'T YOU
LIKE IT?

17:37.300 --> 17:39.200
SEE?
YOU GOT A FAN.

17:39.200 --> 17:41.467
I DON'T DO IT
FOR THE FAME.

17:41.467 --> 17:43.400
THAT'S NOT
WHAT POETRY'S ABOUT.

17:43.400 --> 17:45.233
POETRY'S ABOUT
COMPLEX HUMAN EMOTION,

17:45.233 --> 17:47.500
LIKE, UH,
YOU KNOW, WHATEVER.

17:50.934 --> 17:53.033
HARLEY, YOU GO
TO POETRY READINGS?

17:53.033 --> 17:55.200
YOU DON'T THINK
I'M A SENSITIVE GUY?

17:55.200 --> 17:56.867
I SHOULD
SLAP YOU AROUND
FOR THAT.

17:59.000 --> 18:00.200
CORY, OVER HERE.

18:05.500 --> 18:08.500
YOU KNOW,
I LIKE THIS PLACE.

18:08.500 --> 18:09.900
WHY?

18:09.900 --> 18:12.500
IT'S FRIENDLY,
IT'S HOMEY.

18:12.500 --> 18:14.300
THERE'S JUST SOMETHING
ABOUT IT.

18:14.300 --> 18:15.767
IT'S NOT A CLOSET?

18:15.767 --> 18:17.867
YOU NOTICED THAT, TOO?

18:17.867 --> 18:21.867
YOU WEREN'T
THE ONLY NERVOUS PERSON
IN THAT CLOSET.

18:21.867 --> 18:23.700
NO WAY.

18:23.700 --> 18:27.100
ALL THOSE PEOPLE
OUTSIDE, LISTENING,
WAITING.

18:27.100 --> 18:28.500
YOU GIRLS HAVE IT
SO EASY.

18:28.500 --> 18:32.934
YOU JUST
HAVE TO STAND THERE
AND WAIT TO BE KISSED.

18:32.934 --> 18:34.000
OH, PLEASE.

18:34.000 --> 18:35.867
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
"OH, PLEASE"?

18:35.867 --> 18:38.500
GIRLS DON'T KNOW
WHAT THEY'RE DOING
EITHER.

18:38.500 --> 18:41.367
DOES ANYBODY ELSE KNOW
ABOUT THIS?

18:41.367 --> 18:43.500
YOU'RE THE FIRST PERSON
I'VE TOLD.

18:43.500 --> 18:46.700
IF I HAD
KISSED YOU WRONG...

18:46.700 --> 18:47.900
I WOULDN'T HAVE KNOWN.

18:47.900 --> 18:50.467
I WAS WORRIED
ABOUT WHERE MY HANDS
WOULD GO.

18:50.467 --> 18:53.567
I COULD HAVE HELPED YOU
WITH THAT.

18:54.734 --> 18:58.000
WELL, TOO BAD
WE MISSED OUR CHANCE.

18:58.000 --> 19:03.000
<i>LET'S WELCOME </i>
<i>OUR NEXT WORD PAINTER, </i>
<i>DONOVAN. </i>

19:07.500 --> 19:09.967
I CALL THIS ONE
<i>THE PRODUCE SECTION. </i>

19:11.667 --> 19:12.600
LIGHTS.

19:15.767 --> 19:17.600
PEACHES...

19:17.600 --> 19:19.834
RIPENED IN THE SUN.

19:19.834 --> 19:22.600
HOT AND SWEET...

19:24.400 --> 19:29.300
JUICE WETTING YOUR LIPS...

19:29.300 --> 19:34.000
AND YOU NIBBLING
THE SOFT FLESH.

19:36.400 --> 19:38.133
NIBBLE...

19:40.133 --> 19:41.400
NIBBLE...

19:43.000 --> 19:44.667
NIBBLE.

19:51.200 --> 19:53.967
MR. TURNER,
OVER HERE.

19:53.967 --> 19:55.934
THERE'S A PLACE
RIGHT HERE.

19:58.233 --> 19:59.867
YOU WANT ME
TO SIT HERE?

19:59.867 --> 20:01.667
I JUST ASSUMED
YOU WERE LOOKING
FOR A SEAT.

20:01.667 --> 20:04.300
THIS IS FINE. THANKS.

20:04.300 --> 20:08.000
SO, MR. TURNER...
JONATHAN...

20:08.000 --> 20:09.567
JOHNNY...

20:10.800 --> 20:11.834
HOW GOES IT?

20:11.834 --> 20:13.100
FINE.

20:16.934 --> 20:19.400
I HAD DINNER
WITH KATHERINE
LAST NIGHT.

20:19.400 --> 20:20.667
DID YOU?

20:20.667 --> 20:22.133
MM-HMM.

20:25.700 --> 20:28.233
OH, FOR HEAVEN SAKES!
WHAT HAPPENED?

20:28.233 --> 20:30.600
DID YOU LIKE HER?
DID SHE LIKE YOU?

20:30.600 --> 20:31.900
ARE YOU GOING
TO SEE EACH OTHER
AGAIN?

20:31.900 --> 20:33.100
GIVE ME THE SKINNY.

20:33.100 --> 20:34.400

I LIKE HER.

20:48.667 --> 20:49.834
I'M TELLING YOU,

20:49.834 --> 20:51.967
IT'S A NEW BREAKTHROUGH
IN DATING TECHNOLOGY.

20:51.967 --> 20:54.000
YOU MADE OUT
AT A POETRY READING?

20:54.000 --> 20:55.133
I LOVE POETRY NOW.

20:55.133 --> 20:58.233
IN FACT, I'M THINKING
OF BECOMING A POET.

20:58.233 --> 21:01.500
THERE ONCE WAS A BOY
NAMED CORY...

21:01.500 --> 21:03.867
WHO NOW HAS
AN INTERESTING STORY.

21:03.867 --> 21:06.567
HE LEARNED
ABOUT KISSING...

21:06.567 --> 21:08.400
AND ALL HE WAS MISSING...

21:08.400 --> 21:10.500
WHEN HE AND TOPANGA
MADE OUT!

21:12.500 --> 21:15.400
SHAWN, CAN YOU SAY
SUMMER SCHOOL?

21:17.800 --> 21:19.100
HI, CORY.

21:19.100 --> 21:20.667
HI, TOPANGA.

21:20.667 --> 21:22.400
WELL, SEE YA.

21:22.400 --> 21:23.734

21:25.100 --> 21:28.867
WHEN ARE THEY
GOING TO LEAVE ME ALONE?

21:38.900 --> 21:42.867
I CALL THIS ONE...
<i>CANNED FOOD AISLE. </i>

21:44.300 --> 21:45.567
LIGHTS.

21:47.867 --> 21:52.300
CLING PEACHES
IN HEAVY SYRUP...

21:52.300 --> 21:55.600
SYRUP THAT DRIPS
FROM YOUR TONGUE...

21:56.967 --> 21:58.000
DRIPS...

21:59.300 --> 22:00.200
DRIPS...

22:01.500 --> 22:03.300
DRIPS FROM YOUR TONGUE.

22:04.967 --> 22:07.200
FILLS YOUR MOUTH
WITH SWEETNESS...

22:09.100 --> 22:11.033
AND MAKES YOU
WANT MORE...

22:12.400 --> 22:13.567

22:15.200 --> 22:16.133
