You've met Sergeant Martens
from internal affairs,

13:35.898 --> 13:37.733
And this is FBI Agent Francis.

13:37.983 --> 13:39.652
-Danny Sorenson.
-Danny.

13:39.819 --> 13:42.446
-How's it goin', Agent Francis?
-ARTHUR: Andy Sipowicz, you know.

13:43.239 --> 13:44.281
-Yeah.
-ANDY: What's goin' on?

13:44.490 --> 13:47.535
MIKE: We monitored some conversations
over the last 24 hours

13:47.701 --> 13:50.955
about a big cash score going down.
Wanted to touch base,

13:51.038 --> 13:53.374
See if this stickup homicide
at the cost-rite might fit.

13:56.252 --> 13:59.380
Whose phone you got up?
That you monitored those conversations on?

14:00.047 --> 14:03.551
-If I told ya, I'd have to kill ya.
-He'd have to kill me.

14:05.469 --> 14:08.389
-What brings IAB up, Sarge?
-An off-duty cop was shot.

14:08.556 --> 14:10.474
Yeah, we're aware
an off-duty cop got shot.

14:10.558 --> 14:12.768
I think Detective Sorenson's
more interested

14:12.852 --> 14:16.355
-in your getting up here so soon.
-Ticklin' phones with the bureau, Sarge?

14:16.564 --> 14:19.775
I met agent Francis when the two of us
walked into this office.

14:20.484 --> 14:21.819
Well, we're all in here now.

14:26.031 --> 14:27.283
We got nothin' for ya.

14:27.408 --> 14:28.534
-Absolutely nothing?
-ANDY: NOPE.

14:30.327 --> 14:31.412
Want some Chinese food?

14:31.579 --> 14:34.498
-There were no surveillance cameras?
-Bad guys copped the setup.

14:34.665 --> 14:36.959
-No eyewitnesses?
-No, bad guys had masks on.

14:37.293 --> 14:39.336
MIKE: Why would the bad guys,
take out the surveillance cameras

14:39.545 --> 14:40.588
If they were wearing masks?

14:40.838 --> 14:42.715
DANNY: When they entered the money room,
where all the witnessed were,

14:42.798 --> 14:44.091
they were wearing masks and gloves.

14:44.633 --> 14:46.927
We assume they put them on
when they got inside the building.

14:47.011 --> 14:49.930
ANDY: Being were
below 10,000 feet of altitude.

14:50.139 --> 14:52.141
They may have felt
wearing those ski masks

14:52.349 --> 14:55.394
walking towards the store entrance
through the parking lot

14:55.519 --> 14:57.521
might draw some unwelcome attention.

14:57.730 --> 15:01.066
Hey, Sarge, any chance another reason,
the bad guys didn't put their masks on

15:01.150 --> 15:03.068
was so the off-duty cop
outside the building

15:03.193 --> 15:05.654
-would know who he was dealing with?
-What's your thinking there?

15:05.988 --> 15:07.948
Well, say the off-duty cop
was the setup man,

15:08.157 --> 15:09.825
and they took him out in a double-cross.

15:10.826 --> 15:11.869
I guess that could be.

15:11.952 --> 15:13.787
No, why don't you answer him straight,
huh?

15:13.954 --> 15:17.207
Are you up here so quick
because prior to him going down,

15:17.291 --> 15:19.919
you were already sitting on
this off-duty cop for being wrong?

15:20.085 --> 15:22.713
In which case,
you've probably got a direction for us.

15:23.005 --> 15:26.008
Help regular cops? He'd get tossed
from the cheese-eaters' lodge.

15:26.133 --> 15:28.135
Is this wrangling awkward for you,
Agent Francis?

15:28.218 --> 15:29.845
No, hash things out.

15:30.012 --> 15:31.931
Well, I was thinking
if you got what you needed,

15:32.097 --> 15:33.933
maybe you'd be more comfortable splittin'.

15:35.684 --> 15:38.854
You remind me of Donny Osmond
with your partner's personality.

15:39.021 --> 15:41.649
Agent Francis, I'm proud to tell you
I got all Donny's albums.

15:41.899 --> 15:45.861
Including Mormon Hymns to Federal Agents
who steal their weekly paychecks.

15:46.028 --> 15:47.571
-ANDY: All right, kid.
-ARTHUR: If you're not

15:47.696 --> 15:49.657
showin' us some of yours,
I think we're done.

15:52.117 --> 15:55.537
I will simplify
and make my question more specific.

15:56.121 --> 15:58.958
You are certain
there is no surveillance footage

15:59.041 --> 16:01.210
of the bad guys coming or going.

16:04.213 --> 16:05.589
Yes, we are certain.

16:07.549 --> 16:08.550
At this point.

Excuse me not wanting
to help the bureau collar up.

16:28.696 --> 16:30.322
Oh, that's why you were so close-mouthed.

my office collars. Anyone else is yours.

I don't get to lock up cops.

-Hi, Diane.

17:23.709 --> 17:26.628
-Thanks for, uh... seeing me.
-How are you doing?

17:27.171 --> 17:29.798
I appreciated you giving me your card
at my husband's funeral.

17:29.923 --> 17:33.469
Sorry, I haven't been able to call before.
It's been pretty hectic.

That must be hard every day.

I haven't been doing that good of a job,
but then yesterday, I...

17:45.939 --> 17:48.192
I thought I did pretty well.
My girlfriend's also a cop,

17:48.275 --> 17:51.320
And I was able to, uh...
help her with something.

17:51.987 --> 17:53.113
But then, I, um...

17:54.323 --> 17:56.366

I lose a little more of him.

If the younger ones only set it up,

27:49.042 --> 27:50.377
they could give up their uncles
for a walk.

we pulled the snitch in.

-DIANE: Hey, Hank.
-That girl's asking for you.

38:44.155 --> 38:45.364
-DIANE: Thanks.
-HANK: Good night.

38:45.614 --> 38:46.741
DIANE: Good night.

38:49.368 --> 38:51.495
-Were you looking for me?
-Detective Russell?

38:51.620 --> 38:53.748
-Yeah.
-I was at the Jamaica Rec center,

38:53.831 --> 38:55.791
and I saw your name was added
on the phone list.

38:56.042 --> 38:57.835
You also lost your husband off the job?

39:01.005 --> 39:03.424
Your husband got his heart.

39:06.969 --> 39:08.179
Thank you for your letter.

39:09.180 --> 39:11.057
And the beautiful letter
your husband wrote.

39:12.058 --> 39:14.977
After Bobby passed,
I wanted to write you again or call you.

39:15.061 --> 39:16.896
I waited till your name
was on the phone list.

39:19.315 --> 39:21.817
-Did Linda give you the list?
-Yeah, it's in my purse.

39:23.694 --> 39:25.654
Took me several weeks to look at mine.

39:27.156 --> 39:29.575
Anyways,... I'm on there.

39:30.409 --> 39:33.871
-Thanks, thanks so much.
-Whatever good it might do.

39:34.705 --> 39:36.374
And if you don't call for a while,

39:36.499 --> 39:39.210
don't feel then when you wanna call,
you can't.

39:39.960 --> 39:40.961
Okay.

39:43.881 --> 39:47.093
It was a blessing for me also.
My husband's gift.

39:48.803 --> 39:50.096
It helped me to understand.

40:15.704 --> 40:17.081
-DANNY: Hey, Diane.
-Hi.

40:21.836 --> 40:25.673
-Goin' off the chart today, huh?
-Yeah, I'm doing a four to 12.

40:26.132 --> 40:28.175
You missed our joint effort
with the FBI today.

40:28.634 --> 40:31.178
Very reassuring our federal tax dollars
are being well spent.

40:31.303 --> 40:32.304
(SCOFFS)

40:33.764 --> 40:35.433
(SIGHS) So how's it goin'?

40:37.143 --> 40:39.186
-Okay.
-Not being a wise guy.

40:39.437 --> 40:40.646
No, I know.

40:44.442 --> 40:48.070
I actually called you the other night,
after us working for Jill's boy.

40:49.488 --> 40:52.992
Just to say I was glad
we worked effectively, one thing.

40:54.493 --> 40:56.996
-Mm.
-That was actually it.

40:59.123 --> 41:00.624
And then, the other thing, why I called...

41:01.250 --> 41:04.044
James and I were hanging around,
after we left the bar,

41:04.253 --> 41:07.882
and James was appraising this artwork
hanging in this antique shop window,

41:08.215 --> 41:11.260
deciding whether or not
he was gonna relieve himself in public.

41:11.594 --> 41:14.597
-(SCOFFS)
-And I was thinking I'd call...

41:16.348 --> 41:19.226
just to say I hope you're feeling better
day by day...

41:20.227 --> 41:21.896
knowing it's never gonna be easy.

41:25.691 --> 41:27.860
-Today was a better day?
-Yeah.

41:28.611 --> 41:29.737
Good.

41:31.530 --> 41:32.656
Thanks for asking.

41:44.376 --> 41:46.504
-Good night, Diane.
-Good night.

41:49.924 --> 41:52.885
(UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING)

42:38.806 --> 42:40.849
Of all the empty hands to play...

42:42.309 --> 42:44.395
holding God over Asuncion's head.

42:45.521 --> 42:47.273
No harm taking a flyer.

42:50.025 --> 42:51.193
I hope he suffers.

42:51.944 --> 42:54.113
That the leukemia
doesn't take him quickly.

42:59.410 --> 43:01.495
-Justice without mercy.
-(SIGHS)

43:02.246 --> 43:05.291
It's kind of a long ride
from why I thought I became a lawyer.

43:15.134 --> 43:17.344
Those aren't your usual beliefs, Sylvia.

43:18.512 --> 43:20.931
This is frustration and discouragement.

43:24.310 --> 43:29.148
-It's me God's gonna judge.
-Sylvia, you didn't do nothin' wrong.

43:31.191 --> 43:33.944
He's gonna judge
that I didn't try hard enough

43:34.028 --> 43:35.946
to make anything right.

43:37.239 --> 43:38.282
(SOBS)

43:40.075 --> 43:42.995
And you got some inside knowledge
on his opinion?

43:47.958 --> 43:50.210
Why don't you hold off till he weighs in?
