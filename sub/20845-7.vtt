<i>The Carmichael Show is taped
in front of a live studio audience.</i>

00:04.211 --> 00:06.228
I mean, I know Bobby
said he wanted to talk,

00:06.258 --> 00:08.953
but this is the last place to
come to have a conversation.

00:09.087 --> 00:10.487
This is where you bring your family

00:10.539 --> 00:13.070
after you've run out of
things to say to each other.

00:13.746 --> 00:15.259
Yeah, this place stresses me out.

00:15.344 --> 00:16.569
Every time the chef does something,

00:16.593 --> 00:18.795
I feel like I have to clap,
or I'm being rude.

00:18.820 --> 00:19.898
What are you talking about?

00:19.922 --> 00:22.030
This is the one restaurant
where you can be rude.

00:22.070 --> 00:24.698
They can't spit in your food
'cause we're right here.

00:31.200 --> 00:32.366
I hate this.

00:32.951 --> 00:34.414
If I wanted to pretend to be impressed,

00:34.438 --> 00:37.297
every single time someone did
something, I'd have a child.

00:38.523 --> 00:39.992
- Hey, y'all, thanks for meeting me here.
- Yo.

00:40.016 --> 00:41.625
Look, I got something to tell you

00:41.719 --> 00:43.143
that's gonna blow your minds.

00:43.203 --> 00:45.061
You missed another payment
on your credit card,

00:45.086 --> 00:47.589
and you need to borrow $7,000.

00:48.510 --> 00:52.531
I mean, yes, but that's not
what I was talking about.

00:52.805 --> 00:54.688
Bobby, what happened?
Is everything okay?

00:54.799 --> 00:56.586
All right, I hope
you're ready for this.

00:56.750 --> 00:58.977
Look, I was on Facebook,
minding my own business.

00:59.031 --> 01:02.375
That is the exact opposite
of what Facebook is.

01:03.151 --> 01:04.703
Jerrod, are you gonna let me finish?

01:05.336 --> 01:09.280
Thank you. I was on Facebook,
in everybody else's business,

01:10.125 --> 01:12.672
when I got a message
that you won't believe.

01:17.079 --> 01:18.648
Hey, Maxine, clap your hands.

01:18.682 --> 01:20.516
You're embarrassing us!

01:21.461 --> 01:23.283
Bobby, just tell us.

01:23.414 --> 01:25.197
(sighs) So, look, I got this message

01:25.224 --> 01:28.516
from some guy named Morris
that said he's Dad's son,

01:28.617 --> 01:30.536
and claims he's our half brother.

01:30.727 --> 01:33.609
Oh, my God! You think this is true?

01:33.664 --> 01:34.703
I don't know, but I'm gonna

01:34.727 --> 01:36.281
message him back so I can find out.

01:36.344 --> 01:38.594
Bobby, don't message him back,
okay?

01:38.680 --> 01:39.699
Aw.

01:40.781 --> 01:42.148
Don't worry, baby brother.

01:42.283 --> 01:43.766
I'm gonna get to the bottom of this.

01:43.992 --> 01:46.377
You know, I'm gonna see if
this really is our half brother,

01:46.648 --> 01:50.773
or this is a plot to rob us
and, uh, assault Maxine.

01:52.130 --> 01:54.938
Bobby... it's true, okay?

01:55.047 --> 01:56.795
Morris really is our half brother.

01:56.930 --> 01:59.166
- What?!
- (fire hissing)

01:59.313 --> 02:01.328

02:17.445 --> 02:19.508
Jerrod, we got a half brother?

02:20.211 --> 02:22.680
Dad has a son with another woman?

02:23.008 --> 02:25.522
- How long have you known?
- Not that long.

02:26.008 --> 02:29.148
I guess I found out when
I was ten, so... I don't know...

02:29.680 --> 02:30.721
20 years?

02:30.914 --> 02:33.055
And you never said anything?

02:33.225 --> 02:35.104
I have so many questions.

02:36.391 --> 02:37.578
Oh, my God!

02:37.750 --> 02:40.531
It is so hard to have a
serious conversation here!

02:40.878 --> 02:43.414
Okay, so, how did you even find out?

02:44.062 --> 02:46.008
Yeah, how exactly did you find out?

02:46.383 --> 02:48.703
Well, all right, when I was a kid,

02:48.797 --> 02:50.789
I was riding my bike,
and I rode past this park

02:50.875 --> 02:53.086
where I saw Dad playing basketball

02:53.195 --> 02:54.781
with this kid I didn't recognize.

02:54.875 --> 02:56.367
So I confronted him about it,

02:56.445 --> 02:58.716
and he had no choice
but to tell me the truth.

02:58.883 --> 03:00.359
You must have been devastated.

03:00.500 --> 03:02.414
Actually, I was a little relieved,

03:02.679 --> 03:03.585
'cause for a split second,

03:03.632 --> 03:06.719
I... thought my dad might've
been a pedophile.

03:08.316 --> 03:09.336
So does Cynthia know?

03:09.391 --> 03:10.891
No, no.

03:11.023 --> 03:12.633
Oh, my God,
so did he cheat on her?

03:12.690 --> 03:15.477
No, my dad
is still an honorable man.

03:15.588 --> 03:18.492
He just had a kid a year before
he and my mom were married,

03:18.611 --> 03:20.272
and then he kept that kid a secret

03:20.297 --> 03:22.227
their entire relationship, that's all.

03:22.820 --> 03:25.273
Man, I'm a middle child?

03:25.690 --> 03:28.766
This explains all my
fears and my anxieties,

03:29.305 --> 03:32.109
and my constant string of failures.

03:33.469 --> 03:35.043
Does it?

03:35.914 --> 03:37.921
I can't believe your dad
has been lying to your mom

03:37.945 --> 03:39.242
all these years.

03:40.118 --> 03:41.133
Well...

03:41.218 --> 03:44.461
sometimes it's best to just
keep a secret a secret.

03:44.516 --> 03:46.633
You know? Don't ruin the illusion.

03:46.867 --> 03:49.523
Uh, there are some things you're
just better off not knowing.

03:49.548 --> 03:50.845
Wouldn't you rather think

03:50.916 --> 03:54.430
that... Lance Armstrong
was inexplicably fast,

03:54.492 --> 03:59.938
or... that Michael Jackson just
really liked sleepovers,

04:00.477 --> 04:01.479
or...

04:01.648 --> 04:05.689
W-Woody Allen was just a
really affectionate father.

04:08.570 --> 04:11.875
No. And are you seriously
defending your dad right now?

04:12.038 --> 04:13.804
Of course he is, Maxine.

04:13.844 --> 04:14.898
They're in cahoots.

04:14.969 --> 04:17.202
They've been in cahoots for years.

04:17.289 --> 04:18.946
Yeah, and I actually
don't even understand

04:18.970 --> 04:20.063
how you can defend lying,

04:20.141 --> 04:21.891
'cause your family
is so brutally honest,

04:21.952 --> 04:23.367
that sometimes I pretend to be sick

04:23.438 --> 04:25.195
so I don't even have to go over there.

04:25.789 --> 04:29.078
So you don't have
Crohn's disease, Maxine?

04:29.828 --> 04:33.703
So you mean to tell me I
walked five miles for nothing?

04:34.453 --> 04:35.492
You know what?

04:35.586 --> 04:38.047
Dad's secret is not gonna
be a secret anymore.

04:38.187 --> 04:40.462
We've lived this lie for way too long.

04:40.617 --> 04:41.922
Bobby.

04:42.719 --> 04:44.188
Bobby.

04:45.777 --> 04:47.969
You already did that one.

04:50.268 --> 04:52.367
Dad, Bobby knows about Morris.

04:52.477 --> 04:53.930
- What?
- We all know.

04:54.032 --> 04:55.266
What?

04:56.359 --> 04:58.329
(panting)

04:59.403 --> 05:02.352
I know about Morris,
you lying bastard.

05:03.198 --> 05:05.281
Bobby, shut up.
Your mama's right upstairs.

05:05.353 --> 05:07.883
I can't believe you've kept this
from Cynthia your whole marriage.

05:07.908 --> 05:10.016
I can't believe you're talking
at such a high volume;

05:10.102 --> 05:12.648
are you trying to get
Cynthia to come downstairs?

05:12.678 --> 05:14.453
Yes, 'cause we want Mom to know.

05:14.568 --> 05:15.619
Well, she can't know.

05:15.648 --> 05:17.125
Jerrod, why did you tell him?

05:17.150 --> 05:18.178
I didn't tell him.

05:18.203 --> 05:19.852
Morris messaged him on Facebook.

05:19.953 --> 05:21.094
That damn Zuckerberg.

05:21.158 --> 05:23.094
How many lives is he gonna ruin?

05:23.366 --> 05:26.813
All right, look.
Everybody, take a deep breath,

05:27.219 --> 05:28.813
go outside,

05:29.002 --> 05:31.422
get in your cars and drive home.

05:32.617 --> 05:34.813
We're not going anywhere,
you lying bastard.

05:34.976 --> 05:36.266
JERROD: Bobby.

05:36.469 --> 05:38.586
Stop calling Dad a lying bastard.

05:38.656 --> 05:40.672
Now, I know you guys
think it's a good thing

05:40.733 --> 05:42.242
for Mom to find out about this,

05:42.352 --> 05:44.234
but I think you should give
it some time, you know?

05:44.258 --> 05:46.164
Give it a couple days.
You know what they say,

05:46.203 --> 05:48.733
"Time heals all moral impulses."

05:48.962 --> 05:51.249
No, I am not gonna sleep
on this and change my mind.

05:51.284 --> 05:53.586
Joe has a son. Cynthia needs to know.

05:53.729 --> 05:55.625
All right, what's it gonna take? Money?

05:55.746 --> 05:57.600
'Cause I'm willing to do
whatever it takes

05:57.729 --> 06:00.711
to squash this thing, up to $300.

06:01.648 --> 06:04.945
Look, I'm not spending my life
lying to my mama for $300.

06:05.140 --> 06:07.492
$500, that's my final offer.

06:07.709 --> 06:09.148
Each?

06:09.906 --> 06:11.094
MAXINE: Bobby...

06:11.250 --> 06:14.430
Maxine, I was just
considering it, you know?

06:15.031 --> 06:17.063
Our answer is no.

06:18.086 --> 06:20.172
Joe, how do you live with yourself?

06:20.340 --> 06:22.219
Well, how does anybody
live with themselves?

06:22.288 --> 06:25.313
I mean, we could all be helping
Syrian refugees right now

06:25.422 --> 06:28.109
but we're not, and we're better for it.

06:28.220 --> 06:30.695
Lies is like chlamydia, Dad, okay?

06:30.836 --> 06:32.269
Even though you think
it's harmless,

06:32.296 --> 06:34.578
eventually it turns into cancer.

06:35.976 --> 06:37.107
What?

06:37.205 --> 06:39.594
Chlamydia can turn into cancer?

06:40.744 --> 06:43.336
Um, can't chlamydia turn into cancer?

06:44.033 --> 06:45.374
No, that's HPV.

06:45.531 --> 06:47.384
(whispering): Thank you.

06:47.828 --> 06:50.454
Lies is a lot like HPV, Daddy.

06:50.695 --> 06:51.820
(sighs)

06:54.148 --> 06:56.609
Y'all need to understand
the situation I was in.

06:56.742 --> 06:58.234
I was a teenager.

06:58.417 --> 06:59.843
We barely knew each other.

06:59.883 --> 07:02.141
It was one night,
and she got pregnant.

07:02.306 --> 07:04.894
So I offered to do the right thing,
but she said no,

07:04.929 --> 07:06.783
she wanted to keep it.

07:07.328 --> 07:09.368
Then I offered to do the
other right thing, you know,

07:09.392 --> 07:10.714
help her raise him,
but she didn't even

07:10.738 --> 07:12.112
want me a part of his life.

07:12.383 --> 07:15.273
You had three decades
to tell her the truth.

07:15.404 --> 07:17.279
I know you think that
my mom should know,

07:17.337 --> 07:18.523
but it's really the liar

07:18.563 --> 07:20.020
who takes on all of the burden of this.

07:20.044 --> 07:22.164
I mean, look
what it's done to my dad.

07:22.247 --> 07:25.657
You can just see
the self-loathing in his face.

07:25.887 --> 07:27.862
Look at this man's eyes.

07:28.258 --> 07:30.477
His eyes used to sparkle.

07:30.734 --> 07:32.453
These lies are just weighing them down,

07:32.478 --> 07:34.274
I mean, look at his posture.

07:35.008 --> 07:36.255
And that's just the outside.

07:36.305 --> 07:38.539
Do you know what these lies
are doing to him inside?

07:38.646 --> 07:41.242
It's slowly coagulating
and turning to the tumor

07:41.299 --> 07:43.664
that's gonna end this man's life.

07:44.636 --> 07:47.203
Yeah, I'm surprised I'm still alive.

07:47.351 --> 07:48.961
If anything, knowing he's wronged her

07:48.986 --> 07:50.132
has made him a better husband.

07:50.156 --> 07:52.266
I mean, love isn't what makes
you treat someone nice,

07:52.305 --> 07:53.830
it's guilt.

07:54.557 --> 07:56.570
Any time a woman says,

07:56.648 --> 07:57.984
"He treats me like a princess,"

07:58.056 --> 08:01.457
just know that man has done some
terrible things behind her back.

08:02.218 --> 08:05.629
Joe, it is one thing for you
to lie to your wife.

08:05.735 --> 08:08.164
But you've asked your son
to lie to his mother.

08:08.234 --> 08:09.803
I mean, what do you think
that's done to Jerrod?

08:09.827 --> 08:12.250
I think it's made him
into the complicated man

08:12.275 --> 08:14.172
that you love today.

08:15.127 --> 08:16.750
You know what they call
people

08:16.868 --> 08:19.944
who have no daddy issues, Maxine?

08:20.094 --> 08:21.883
Boring.

08:22.319 --> 08:24.640
Joe, think about how much worse
this is gonna be for Cynthia

08:24.664 --> 08:26.547
if she finds out from someone else.

08:26.674 --> 08:29.781
I mean, God forbid, she meets
Morris at your funeral?

08:29.930 --> 08:32.164
I mean, imagine that,
the worst day of her life

08:32.219 --> 08:35.188
made even worse by being
blindsided by news like this.

08:35.256 --> 08:38.844
How long are we gonna
talk about my death today?

08:39.510 --> 08:42.649

What are you all doing here?

09:10.244 --> 09:13.274

09:13.376 --> 09:14.416
and they... they love pie,

09:14.462 --> 09:18.321
so they are over here to
get some of that pie.

09:18.579 --> 09:22.868
Oh. Well, I guess I better
get you all... some pie.

09:22.920 --> 09:24.462
Thank you.

09:25.438 --> 09:26.954
All right, you got two options.

09:27.006 --> 09:30.028
Get the hell out, or shut up
and stuff your face with pie.

09:30.141 --> 09:31.337
(groans)

09:31.406 --> 09:32.786
I couldn't even look her in the eye.

09:32.810 --> 09:34.540
Well, just look at the pie.

09:34.798 --> 09:36.018
I don't think I can do this.

09:36.076 --> 09:38.376
Jerrod, get your girl.

09:40.149 --> 09:42.931
It doesn't really work like that, Dad.

09:43.262 --> 09:44.907
All right, everybody, just act normal.

09:45.227 --> 09:48.391
Maxine, I made this gluten-free crust

09:48.524 --> 09:50.376
for your Crohn's disease.

09:50.494 --> 09:52.626
(clears throat)

09:53.563 --> 09:55.594
It was difficult
to figure out, at first,

09:55.636 --> 09:57.677
how to make it taste not disgusting.

09:57.702 --> 10:02.384
But all I had to do was add
an alarming amount of sugar.

10:03.891 --> 10:04.938
Thank you.

10:05.016 --> 10:07.345
Oh, it's just gluten, Maxine.

10:07.511 --> 10:09.235
Yeah, Maxine, relax.

10:09.329 --> 10:11.368
CYNTHIA: Oh, Bobby?

10:12.040 --> 10:14.212
You got an eyelash.

10:14.641 --> 10:16.327
Close your eye, let
me get that for you.

10:16.415 --> 10:17.528
All right, I got it.

10:17.571 --> 10:20.110
Go ahead, make a wish.

10:20.376 --> 10:24.935
Well, Mama, I wish you had
the foresight to see the snakes

10:25.063 --> 10:28.048
- in the grass...
- Just blow the lash!

10:28.821 --> 10:32.755
Okay, I'm gonna get
the rest of y'all's pie.

10:33.813 --> 10:36.513
What the hell was that?
That wasn't normal.

10:36.931 --> 10:39.649
I got to admit, all right,
this just feels wrong.

10:39.765 --> 10:41.688
Now it just feels like we're
conspiring against Mom.

10:41.712 --> 10:43.384
I never noticed how nice she was.

10:43.469 --> 10:44.931
Has she always been this nice?

10:45.227 --> 10:48.413
Yes. Mom is an angel, Jerrod.

10:48.798 --> 10:51.528
Jerrod, I made you some chocolate cake.

10:51.626 --> 10:55.212
I know you don't like blackberry pie.

10:55.696 --> 10:57.477
Ma, you didn't even know I was coming.

10:57.571 --> 11:01.407
Well, if you stay ready
you don't have to get ready.

11:02.043 --> 11:03.727
Oh, man.

11:04.435 --> 11:08.001
Ma... I'm-I'm so sorry.

11:08.040 --> 11:09.649
H-Hey, hey, do we have
any more of that, uh,

11:09.673 --> 11:11.032
the whipped cream that we got?

11:11.080 --> 11:12.669
- Yeah, I think so.
- Well, let's go get it.

11:12.693 --> 11:14.802
- Go get... oh.
- Ah.

11:14.969 --> 11:18.688
♪ I got the world on a string ♪

11:18.734 --> 11:20.546
♪ Sittin' on a rainbow... ♪

11:20.571 --> 11:22.407
Get out now!

11:22.610 --> 11:25.595
♪ Got this string upon my finger ♪

11:25.670 --> 11:28.813
JOE AND CYNTHIA:
♪ What a world, what a life ♪

11:28.838 --> 11:34.062
♪ I'm in love. ♪

11:42.180 --> 11:44.281
(sighs) You got up early.

11:44.418 --> 11:45.418
Couldn't sleep?

11:45.445 --> 11:47.984
No. I'm all messed up.

11:48.180 --> 11:50.211
Every time I close my eyes,

11:50.320 --> 11:52.523
I just keep seeing my
dead dad in a casket

11:52.625 --> 11:54.875
with my mom standing over him, crying.

11:54.969 --> 11:57.528
And then Morris comes up to her

11:57.553 --> 12:00.148
and introduces himself
as my dad's firstborn son.

12:00.188 --> 12:03.945
And... then my mom looks me

12:04.102 --> 12:06.297
square in the eyes, with tears in hers,

12:06.385 --> 12:09.359
and she says, "I thought you loved me."

12:09.664 --> 12:13.180
Then she takes out a gun
and shoots herself in the head

12:13.890 --> 12:18.281
and she falls on top of my
father's, cold dead corpse.

12:18.634 --> 12:21.662
But what about you? You sleep okay?

12:22.235 --> 12:23.376
No, I had the same dream,

12:23.415 --> 12:26.438
but... then your mom pulled
out the gun, she shot me.

12:26.563 --> 12:29.160
(knocking at door)

12:35.282 --> 12:36.470
Hey, Maxine.

12:36.563 --> 12:38.102
Hi, Joe.

12:39.843 --> 12:42.852
Well, I can't stand here and
talk to you 'cause I got a...

12:43.009 --> 12:45.157
Crohn's flare-up.

12:45.868 --> 12:47.654
Stop lying, Maxine.

12:47.712 --> 12:50.236
You don't have Crohn's disease.

12:50.790 --> 12:51.922
What's up, Dad?

12:52.359 --> 12:53.359
Rough night.

12:53.797 --> 12:55.734
Yeah, it was for me, too.

12:56.195 --> 12:57.804
Now, be honest with me, son.

12:57.922 --> 12:59.778
Watching me lie to your
mother all these years

12:59.836 --> 13:01.515
really messed you up, didn't it?

13:01.687 --> 13:05.164
No, actually, I think it's given
me a healthy amount of cynicism

13:05.189 --> 13:06.854
that's protected me
my entire life.

13:06.879 --> 13:07.898
It-It taught me

13:07.968 --> 13:10.644
to question everything
and to accept people's flaws.

13:10.726 --> 13:13.336
If anything, watching you
lie to Mom all these years

13:13.445 --> 13:14.927
did more to help raise me

13:14.986 --> 13:17.672
than any good parenting
you tried to do, so...

13:18.320 --> 13:20.078
Thanks, Dad.

13:20.770 --> 13:22.344
I can't keep doing this.

13:22.449 --> 13:24.562
I can't keep asking
the whole family to lie

13:24.594 --> 13:25.926
every time they see her.

13:26.070 --> 13:27.673
I mean, ruining you was one thing,

13:27.698 --> 13:30.843
but Bobby and Maxine,
they don't deserve this.

13:31.562 --> 13:32.664
Yeah, you're right.

13:32.750 --> 13:34.013
They are good people.

13:34.040 --> 13:37.371
Yeah, you know what,
I thought about this

13:37.400 --> 13:39.708
and I'm gonna tell
your mama everything.

13:39.923 --> 13:41.650
Really?
Are you really gonna do it?

13:41.885 --> 13:42.799
Yeah.

13:42.909 --> 13:44.815
I should've done this a long time ago,

13:44.984 --> 13:48.827
but thanks for, you know,
always being there for me.

13:49.245 --> 13:50.545
You mean...

13:50.639 --> 13:54.177
lying to Mom about your
bastard son for 20 years?

13:54.828 --> 13:56.857
Yeah, being there.

13:58.445 --> 13:59.662
Hey, Dad.

13:59.812 --> 14:01.684
If Mom does leave you,

14:01.756 --> 14:03.363
I don't want you to
think for one second

14:03.390 --> 14:05.180
that I'm gonna spend a
single Christmas with you

14:05.204 --> 14:07.256
in your lonely studio apartment,
okay?

14:07.379 --> 14:10.982
I-I just want to put that out
there, but, uh, good luck, man.

14:12.969 --> 14:15.756
You are one cold son of a bitch.

14:16.716 --> 14:18.729
But that's on me.

14:25.406 --> 14:27.381
- Cynthia.
- Joe!

14:27.451 --> 14:30.294
I got those seedless
tangerines you like.

14:30.370 --> 14:32.497
The ones with seeds,
they were cheaper,

14:32.584 --> 14:34.373
but I got the ones you like.

14:34.653 --> 14:36.326
Cynthia, we need to talk.

14:36.943 --> 14:38.420
What's going on, Joe?

14:38.771 --> 14:40.224
I need you to sit down.

14:40.748 --> 14:42.451
Why?

14:42.815 --> 14:44.879
Joe, you scaring me.

14:44.980 --> 14:46.434
Please, just sit down.

14:49.910 --> 14:53.254
Now, I'm gonna tell you something,

14:53.340 --> 14:55.480
but I'm-I'm just nervous that
it's gonna change everything.

14:55.504 --> 14:57.301
Well, hold on, before you say it,

14:57.458 --> 15:00.180
is it something that I
absolutely need to know?

15:00.293 --> 15:02.918
Because things are so nice now, Joe.

15:03.098 --> 15:05.684
We got those seedless tangerines.

15:06.183 --> 15:07.863
You need to know this.

15:08.332 --> 15:11.832
Now, you know, I've been wanting
to tell you for a while,

15:11.902 --> 15:14.635
but every time I tried,
I just, I got so scared

15:14.699 --> 15:17.504
'cause I-I thought it would
ruin everything and-and...

15:18.074 --> 15:20.348
Well, shoot, I was just
so stupid back then,

15:20.448 --> 15:22.910
just young and stupid.

15:22.948 --> 15:25.668
And, well...

15:26.551 --> 15:27.614
(groans)

15:28.168 --> 15:32.371
I guess I'm just
making more excuses for myself.

15:32.579 --> 15:35.598
Joe, I-I don't like
the way that it sound.

15:35.778 --> 15:38.582
And I don't even want to
know what this is about.

15:38.676 --> 15:40.299
You know, I'm gonna go ahead
and make us some lunch.

15:40.323 --> 15:41.018
Cynthia.

15:41.043 --> 15:43.793
- Joe.
- I have a son.

15:44.309 --> 15:46.533
He was born a year
before we got married.

15:46.645 --> 15:49.426
Now, I-I-I know I should've
told you from the beginning,

15:49.559 --> 15:51.871
but I didn't know how
you would react and...

15:52.307 --> 15:54.285
Cynthia, I am sorry.

15:54.770 --> 15:56.160
I know you got questions for me.

15:56.248 --> 15:57.489
No.

15:58.715 --> 16:00.184
I don't have any questions.

16:00.286 --> 16:02.574
I don't want to know anything.

16:02.816 --> 16:04.785
What do you want for lunch, Joe?

16:04.835 --> 16:06.543
Cynthia.

16:07.753 --> 16:10.304
Don't! Don't come near me, Joe.

16:10.405 --> 16:12.137
No!

16:12.365 --> 16:15.176
You are not the one
to comfort me, not...

16:15.535 --> 16:18.346
not when you're the one that did this.

16:23.082 --> 16:25.270
(crying): What do you want for lunch?

16:25.576 --> 16:27.356
I know we can get through this.

16:27.574 --> 16:29.410
All I need you to do is just tell me

16:29.465 --> 16:31.606
what-what I can do
to make things better.

16:31.817 --> 16:34.360
Joe, do you want mustard
on your sandwich?

16:34.486 --> 16:36.239
Cynthia.

16:37.926 --> 16:39.645
Mustard. Well, Joe?

16:39.747 --> 16:42.114
You want mustard on your sandwich?

16:43.387 --> 16:44.970
Mustard, Joe. Yes or no?

16:45.082 --> 16:47.832
Yes or no?

16:48.082 --> 16:49.621
Yes.

16:51.309 --> 16:53.145
(quietly): Okay.

16:55.733 --> 16:56.864
Here it is, Joe.

16:56.997 --> 16:58.926
Go ahead and eat your sandwich.

16:59.145 --> 17:01.012
Cynthia, what are you doing?

17:01.134 --> 17:04.106
(crying): I don't know.
I don't know what I'm doing.

17:04.270 --> 17:08.387
I'm doing what you did
to our whole marriage,

17:08.442 --> 17:12.324
pretending that everything
is normal when it isn't.

17:13.098 --> 17:16.121
Joe, I don't even know who you are.

17:16.167 --> 17:18.670
I mean, you're not the
man I thought you were.

17:18.785 --> 17:22.229
My best friend would
never do this to me.

17:22.256 --> 17:23.375
Cynthia, I'm sorry.

17:23.402 --> 17:25.121
(crying): No, j-just...

17:25.321 --> 17:27.817
just go, Joe, go.

17:27.981 --> 17:29.949
Get out.

17:30.895 --> 17:33.614

17:46.676 --> 17:48.188
Daddy, I'm putting my foot down.

17:48.270 --> 17:49.270
You got to tell Mom.

17:49.316 --> 17:50.364
It's the right thing to do

17:50.458 --> 17:51.978
and I'm not leaving till you tell her.

17:52.170 --> 17:53.731
I just told her.

17:53.910 --> 17:56.215
She's crying in the kitchen.

18:10.389 --> 18:12.621
Oh! Cynthia?!

18:14.637 --> 18:16.728
I'm ready to talk now, Joe.

18:17.028 --> 18:21.520
Okay, 'cause I thought for a
minute you were gonna kill me.

18:24.342 --> 18:25.801
Good.

18:26.520 --> 18:28.801
Think that.

18:29.246 --> 18:32.020
You've made me that woman, Joe,

18:32.530 --> 18:36.129
that woman that everybody
pities and whispers about

18:36.231 --> 18:39.551
when she walks
through the grocery store.

18:40.012 --> 18:42.121
I don't know how to be that woman.

18:42.450 --> 18:46.449
I'm always the woman
who's doing the whispering.

18:47.545 --> 18:49.785
Cynthia, I am so sorry.

18:49.989 --> 18:54.137
And... anything you need,
you just tell me.

19:02.871 --> 19:04.598
What's his name?

19:05.246 --> 19:07.145
Morris.

19:08.794 --> 19:11.723
That's a terrible name.

19:31.928 --> 19:33.928
What do you think Mom
and Dad got to tell us?

19:34.150 --> 19:36.436
I'm worried that they're
getting a divorce.

19:36.756 --> 19:39.917
This is a bad-news restaurant.

19:40.115 --> 19:41.797
Well, my parents told me
they were getting divorced

19:41.821 --> 19:43.880
at TGI Fridays 'cause they
knew no one would notice

19:43.959 --> 19:45.326
if I made a scene.

19:45.724 --> 19:46.771
Did you?

19:46.873 --> 19:49.030
Oh, big time.

19:49.308 --> 19:50.449
Hey, kids.

19:50.558 --> 19:51.631
- Hey, Mom and Dad.
- Oh, there...

19:51.655 --> 19:52.904
there they are, looking good.

19:52.929 --> 19:54.044
Mom and Dad. Lovebirds.

19:54.069 --> 19:55.903
- Mom and...
- Knock it off.

20:00.320 --> 20:03.210
Listen, everybody,
we're gonna get through this.

20:03.413 --> 20:06.656
Just because your father
lied to me for 35 years,

20:06.681 --> 20:09.156
it does not make him a bad man.

20:09.363 --> 20:11.039
It makes him a flawed man

20:11.064 --> 20:14.219
who will probably have
difficulty getting into heaven,

20:14.326 --> 20:16.828
but that is not my burden to carry.

20:17.164 --> 20:19.050
Well, I'm gonna deal with
that when I get there.

20:19.124 --> 20:21.351
I can be very persuasive.

20:22.151 --> 20:24.638
So, how are we gonna handle this?

20:24.929 --> 20:26.703
Gonna joke about it?

20:26.867 --> 20:28.078
Sweep it under the rug?

20:28.171 --> 20:30.280
Just let me know, I don't have
strong feelings either way.

20:30.304 --> 20:34.250
No, we're gonna be
very honest, very open.

20:34.326 --> 20:37.187
I mean, all families
have things to deal with.

20:37.339 --> 20:42.445
You know, my husband
has a son that isn't mine.

20:42.648 --> 20:44.402
So, there it is.

20:44.566 --> 20:46.841
Know who you're sitting with.

20:47.254 --> 20:49.574
We love each other,
we're a strong family

20:49.647 --> 20:51.722
and we're gonna get through this.

20:52.152 --> 20:55.758
She slept with my brother
and we're still together.

20:58.004 --> 21:00.847
Okay. Well...

21:01.034 --> 21:03.183
let's eat.
