<i>It's alive!</i>

00:34.253 --> 00:36.853
<b>7x17 - Batman Forever 21 </b>

00:38.937 --> 00:41.608
<i>Off to Neverland!</i>

00:41.610 --> 00:46.413
Come on, nana!

01:03.063 --> 01:05.665
<i>Yay!</i>

01:05.667 --> 01:10.503
Now, fantastic fools, you
shall feel the wrath of Doom!

01:10.505 --> 01:14.583
Sheesh, Doom, why the heck
are you so grouchy all the time?

01:15.677 --> 01:17.625
Yes! The finishing touch.

01:17.626 --> 01:20.547
Now the world will tremble when

01:20.549 --> 01:23.516
- they look upon Dr. Doom!
- Dr. Doom, wait.

01:23.518 --> 01:24.951
The mask is not ...

01:24.953 --> 01:27.821
Sweet lord in heaven!

01:27.823 --> 01:30.290
Oh, wait.
The mask is upside down.

01:30.292 --> 01:32.926
Hold still, Doctor.

01:32.928 --> 01:35.762
- Okay, once more with feeling.
- You sons of ...

01:37.299 --> 01:39.532
- Let us not delay.
- Yes, the codpiece remains.

01:39.534 --> 01:41.434
What did you ...
did you say "codpiece"?

01:41.636 --> 01:45.672
- Clock out, guys!
- Oh, the codpiece is upside down.

01:45.674 --> 01:48.474
What did you ...

01:51.745 --> 01:53.713
Sorry about your dick, dude.

01:54.060 --> 01:56.049
You're going to prison, Sinestro.

01:56.051 --> 01:57.250
<i> No!</i>

01:57.252 --> 01:59.652
- We love him!
- Sorry, green fool.

01:59.654 --> 02:02.888
Your ring won't affect anything
yellow, so I adopted

02:02.906 --> 02:06.259
- a bunch of Asian kids.
- "A," that's incredibly

02:06.261 --> 02:08.862
racist, and, "B," that's
not how my ring works.

02:08.864 --> 02:11.555
I know, I know, but the more
I thought about it, the more

02:11.556 --> 02:14.200
I fell in love with the idea.
I adore these little scamps.

02:14.202 --> 02:16.769
<i> We love you, Mr. Sinestro!</i>

02:16.771 --> 02:18.274
Ohh, look at 'em!

02:18.520 --> 02:22.342
Hi. I'm a centaur ...
half man, half horse.

02:22.344 --> 02:25.745

keep my people alive.

Bear Grylls here.

02:54.660 --> 02:56.953
Today, I'm gonna show
you how to survive in a

02:56.954 --> 02:59.496
truly exotic environment.
Behind me are Matt Dillon,

02:59.498 --> 03:02.265
Neve Campbell, and Denise
Richards from the movie

03:02.267 --> 03:05.502
"Wild things."

03:05.504 --> 03:08.438
What you want to do is distract
Matt Dillon by talking about how

03:08.440 --> 03:10.140
good he was in
"Drugstore cowboy."

03:10.142 --> 03:12.976
Then you finger bang the girls
under the water while the jets

03:12.978 --> 03:14.444
- hide it all.
- Who are you?

03:14.446 --> 03:16.413
You know, you were just incredible

03:16.415 --> 03:18.548
- in "Drugstore cowboy."
- Oh.

03:18.550 --> 03:20.984
Oh, my gosh, this is the best
hot tub ever.

03:20.986 --> 03:23.219
Ooh, I'm really branching out from TV!

03:23.221 --> 03:26.041
And remember, a bird in the hand is

03:26.042 --> 03:29.426
worth a hand in two bushes.

03:29.428 --> 03:31.294
<i>Dr. Stone to Houston in the blind.</i>

03:31.296 --> 03:32.466
<i>Is anyone there? Please?</i>

03:32.467 --> 03:33.830
Please, you're my only hope.

03:37.969 --> 03:40.791
- Hello? Can you hear me?
- Hey, hot tits.

03:40.792 --> 03:44.541
- You're on with dick wax and the fridge.
- Listen, I'm an astronaut

03:44.543 --> 03:46.939
stranded in space. A-actually,
I'm more of a medical

03:46.940 --> 03:49.245
doctor than an astronaut
who, some would say, had no

03:49.247 --> 03:50.880
business up here in the first place.

03:50.882 --> 03:53.550
<i>Uh-oh, sounds like someone's
a little cuckoo for cocoa puffs!</i>

03:53.552 --> 03:55.452
<i>I'd let her suck on my cocoa puffs.</i>

03:55.454 --> 03:57.823
<i>Oh, the fridge, you son of a bitch!</i>

03:57.824 --> 03:59.956
Listen! My name is Dr. Ryan Stone.

<i>Easy there, Dr. Bone.</i>

04:12.471 --> 04:15.672
<i>We'll connect you with NASA if
you can name the famous singer</i>

04:15.674 --> 04:18.274
<i>- who had a nip slip yesterday.
- I don't know.</i>

04:18.276 --> 04:19.843
I've been in space this whole week.

04:19.845 --> 04:22.312
<i>Unh, unh, unh!
No nip slip, no NASA.</i>

04:22.314 --> 04:25.415
Fine. Was it...
Beyoncé?

04:25.417 --> 04:29.085
<i>It was Beyoncé!
You know your nip slips!</i>

04:29.087 --> 04:31.187
<i>We'll connect you with NASA now.</i>

04:31.189 --> 04:33.123
<i>- NASA headquarters. Houston.
- Oh, thank god.</i>

04:33.125 --> 04:34.958
- This is Dr. Rya...
- Boom!

04:34.960 --> 04:36.760
<i>You just got fridged!</i>

04:36.762 --> 04:39.551
Oh [bleep] it.

04:40.381 --> 04:42.532
You are dead, asshole!

04:42.534 --> 04:44.334
- Oh, yeah?
- Aah, like a good neighbor,

04:44.336 --> 04:46.202
- state farm is there!
- With state farm's ... peace!

04:46.204 --> 04:47.237
Wh-What?

04:47.239 --> 04:49.606
You messed with the wrong guy!

04:50.300 --> 04:54.669
We'll be holding an election
to determine Papa Smurf's second

04:54.670 --> 05:00.049
in command, and since I'm the
smartest, I know you'll be choosing me.

05:02.598 --> 05:05.489
This is nothing short of betrayal.

05:05.490 --> 05:08.833
These blue buffoons have no idea
with whom they're trifling.

05:08.834 --> 05:12.086
Hell, they don't even realize I've
landed on my head so many times,

05:12.087 --> 05:15.098
I've lost my moral compass and
now speak with a Southern accent.

05:19.036 --> 05:22.238
Now to smurf the pawns on the
smurfing board.

05:22.240 --> 05:25.008
- Brainy Smurf?
- I simply had

05:25.010 --> 05:27.443
to express my admiration to you,
Gargamel.

05:27.445 --> 05:29.873
Even though your
villainous plots threaten my

05:29.874 --> 05:32.248
people, I've always
appreciated their cunning.

05:32.250 --> 05:35.285
Wow. I-I didn't realize
how much I ...

05:35.287 --> 05:38.621
- needed to hear that.
- I only wish there was someone

05:38.623 --> 05:42.348
that could help you succeed by giving
you the location of Smurf village.

05:42.349 --> 05:47.030
And now in three, two, one.

05:47.032 --> 05:49.833
- Wait! You could tell me.
- Smurfmate.

05:49.835 --> 05:53.336
My dear, it appears I've seduced you.

05:53.338 --> 05:56.105
- And now I want a favor.
- Gee, I don't know if I should

05:56.107 --> 05:58.708
Help you, Brainy.
Ohh!

05:58.710 --> 06:01.644
Oh, my.
Oh, smurf it.

06:01.646 --> 06:04.714
Smurf it right.... there.

06:04.716 --> 06:07.785
- Oh, it's so good.
- Well, what did you expect?

06:07.786 --> 06:09.219
This is not Netflix.

06:09.221 --> 06:12.956
Looks like someone
had a secret past life,

06:12.958 --> 06:16.459
- Handy Smurf.
- I ... it's not my fault!

06:16.461 --> 06:18.795
My name is literally
slang for "hand job."

06:18.797 --> 06:21.764
It took me years before I
figured out the whole

06:21.766 --> 06:23.733
- handyman angle.
- As long as you build the

06:23.735 --> 06:27.270
invention we discussed,
no one will be the wiser.

06:27.272 --> 06:30.406
Oh, god.

06:30.408 --> 06:33.576
The votes are in, and
Papa Smurf's new second in

06:33.578 --> 06:35.345
command is...
Hefty Smurf!

06:37.216 --> 06:39.082
<i>Oh, he's just so hot.</i>

06:39.084 --> 06:42.785
At last!
I killed a geriatric, four-inch gnome!

06:42.787 --> 06:47.446
"Least likely to succeed," my
ass, class of '53, huh?

06:48.760 --> 06:51.861
Are you double-crossing ...

06:53.998 --> 06:57.200
Uh, B-b-brainy did it!

06:57.202 --> 07:00.370
He saved us.
I demand we redo the vote.

07:02.689 --> 07:07.241
And so, after a runoff vote,
I am honored to announce

07:07.242 --> 07:11.147
that Papa Smurf's second
in command is... Hefty?!

07:11.149 --> 07:13.016
You just can't argue with how
hot he is.

07:13.018 --> 07:14.550
Impossible!

07:14.552 --> 07:18.211
I played the game perfectly.
I ... actually, you know what?

07:18.584 --> 07:20.416
He is pretty hot.

07:20.703 --> 07:23.092
As a Neanderthal, my brain is

07:23.094 --> 07:25.728
way bigger than all you
homo erectus.

07:25.730 --> 07:28.798
Okay, Oog.
Don't have to keep bragging

07:28.800 --> 07:31.067
- how great you are.
- I think I do.

08:26.892 --> 08:30.343
Today was so fun, Baloo.
I loved that song you sang about

08:30.345 --> 08:33.379
- the bare necessities.
- And you get that "bare" not

08:33.381 --> 08:36.448
only means "basic," but also
that I'm a bear, right?

08:36.451 --> 08:39.385
- Yes, we get the wordplay.
- Good night, Baloo.

08:39.386 --> 08:44.090
Good night, little britches.

08:46.370 --> 08:50.263
- Watch out, Baloo.
- Whoa! My tacos!

08:50.265 --> 08:52.365
- Hi, Rebecca.
- Hi, Baloo.

08:52.367 --> 08:55.769
Ooh!

08:56.281 --> 08:58.571
What's wrong, Baloo?

08:58.573 --> 09:01.908
Oh, I'm having those dreams
again about a life where I flew

09:01.910 --> 09:05.445
a plane and ate tacos and
sometimes dressed in drag,

09:05.447 --> 09:08.214
nominally to solve crimes but
mostly because I just enjoyed it.

09:08.216 --> 09:10.049
That's ridiculous.

09:10.051 --> 09:12.619
You've always been a bear in the jungle.

09:12.621 --> 09:16.890
Who wants to be my dinner to...

09:20.928 --> 09:24.613
- How did you do that, Baloo?
- I don't know.

09:25.534 --> 09:29.736
- He's catching on.
- Agent 754 is in danger of

09:29.738 --> 09:32.906
remembering his former life as a
bush pilot and C.I.A. asset.

09:32.908 --> 09:36.810
Looks like our plan has fallen
into a real "talespin."

09:36.812 --> 09:39.512
Tailspin, referring to both a
plane flying out of control

09:39.514 --> 09:43.117
- and a crazy story.
- Yeah, we get the wordplay.

09:49.124 --> 09:50.623
Louie.

09:50.625 --> 09:53.226
You're the missing piece, Louie.
And now you're gonna tell me

09:53.228 --> 09:55.829
about my former life, you dirty
[bleep] ape!

09:55.831 --> 09:58.231
- You mean project Blackwater?
- Huh?

09:58.233 --> 10:01.401
They put black dye in the
water and fed it to the bears in

10:01.403 --> 10:04.404
<i>the hopes that it would allow
them to pilot planes.</i>

10:04.406 --> 10:07.146
<i>474 bears crash-landed.</i>

10:07.147 --> 10:10.243
<i>It was terribly expensive.</i>

10:10.245 --> 10:13.947
You were the only bear that knew
how to read an altometer.

10:13.949 --> 10:15.315
- Altimeter.
- See?!

10:15.317 --> 10:17.938
And now that your
memory's returned, you're

10:17.939 --> 10:20.320
a danger to them.
The things you know ...

10:24.259 --> 10:27.627
Show yourself!

10:27.629 --> 10:29.362
- Rebecca?
- That's right.

10:29.364 --> 10:32.065
It's me, Baloo.
I can explain everything, as

10:32.067 --> 10:35.034
- long as a bullet doesn't ... Aah!
- No!

10:35.036 --> 10:37.056
It's payback time.

10:37.057 --> 10:38.404
<i>Drink, sir?</i>

10:38.406 --> 10:40.206
- No, thanks.
- Are you sure?

10:40.208 --> 10:45.211
It's...Blackwater.
This is gonna be a real drag, by

10:45.213 --> 10:47.780
which I mean it'll be tedious
and unpleasant, but, also, I am

10:47.782 --> 10:50.350
- a male wearing female garments.
- Yeah, we get the wordplay.
