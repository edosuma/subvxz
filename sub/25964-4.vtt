You needed including space.

A lot of empty envelopes.

00:28.933 --> 00:29.932
In the offering.

00:29.934 --> 00:33.131
I think someone
Might be stealing.

00:33.133 --> 00:35.532
Where is the money?
What did I tell you?

00:35.534 --> 00:37.198
You know, Satan is always busy.

00:37.200 --> 00:38.865
That old devil
Sent us a tax bill.

00:38.867 --> 00:40.665
Saying we owe $2 million.

00:40.667 --> 00:41.999
And james and I Were hoping.

00:42.001 --> 00:44.265
That you'd be able
To help us out here.

00:44.267 --> 00:45.965
I filed for divorce. What?!

00:45.967 --> 00:48.398
Mae My husband had me served
With these divorce papers,

00:48.400 --> 00:50.165
And I just want to know
What my options are.

00:50.167 --> 00:52.965
Once your bishop is done
With you, the party is over.

06:06.534 --> 06:09.132
Maricel, you did a wonderful
Job on the sunroom.

06:09.134 --> 06:10.865
Thank you, ma'am.

06:12.467 --> 06:15.665
And I know you were thinking
About canceling...

06:16.534 --> 06:18.532
But everyone
Is so excited to come.

06:32.667 --> 06:35.398
So, now, we are
Expecting a good turnout?

06:35.400 --> 06:36.532
Yes.

06:36.534 --> 06:40.499
The entire round table
Ended up rsvping except for one.

06:40.501 --> 06:42.098
And who might that be?

06:42.100 --> 06:43.832
Ms. Cross.

06:43.834 --> 06:46.832
Well, I hope she isn't too ill.

06:46.834 --> 06:48.732
And jacob called.

06:48.734 --> 06:50.798
They're coming from therapy,
So they'll be here,

06:50.800 --> 06:52.132
But they'll run late.

06:52.134 --> 06:54.665
Jacob and the family Are coming?

06:54.667 --> 06:55.998
The bishop told me
To invite them.

06:56.000 --> 06:59.598
Excuse me, ma'am, Ms. Jackson.

06:59.600 --> 07:01.199
Well, I think you're needed.

07:03.534 --> 07:06.065
Very good work, everyone.
It's beautiful.

07:16.134 --> 07:18.598
What are you doing
In here, james?

07:18.600 --> 07:20.265
Maricel had
The guest bath cleaned.

07:20.267 --> 07:22.132
I didn't want to
Take a shower there.

07:22.134 --> 07:23.865
Is someone coming over?

07:23.867 --> 07:26.732
No, no, but you know
How folk like to roam.

07:26.734 --> 07:29.932
I... I'll get Out of your way.

07:29.934 --> 07:31.998
Karine did tell me That jacob,

07:32.000 --> 07:35.265
Kerissa and the children
Were coming over.

07:35.267 --> 07:38.865
Well, you know
How clara loves jacob,

07:38.867 --> 07:40.867
And we still don't have
That check of hers in hand.

07:42.000 --> 07:45.665
So in the interest of putting on
A good show...

07:45.667 --> 07:47.598
That makes sense.

07:47.600 --> 07:49.332
Break a leg.

07:54.867 --> 07:56.198
Now, zora,
When we get over there,

07:56.200 --> 07:57.398
I don't want you
Sneaking around upstairs.

07:57.400 --> 07:58.732
I'm not going to Sneak anywhere.

07:58.734 --> 08:01.265
Zora, you need to be
Respectful to your father,

08:01.267 --> 08:03.732
Me and everybody else
At this thing, or you can't go.

08:03.734 --> 08:05.932
I get it.

08:05.934 --> 08:07.132
And you need
To correct that tone,

08:07.134 --> 08:09.932
Or you're going
Straight to boot camp.

08:09.934 --> 08:11.332
As long as you aren't...

08:11.334 --> 08:14.532
- I'm sorry. I didn't catch that.
- I'll be in the car.

08:14.534 --> 08:16.532
Empty threats don't help.

08:16.534 --> 08:18.465
Who's making empty threats?

08:18.467 --> 08:20.332
Come on, baby.

08:20.334 --> 08:22.398
I have filled out
The application.

08:22.400 --> 08:23.732
I've written the check.

08:23.734 --> 08:25.865
All I have to do is put
Two stamps on the envelope.

08:25.867 --> 08:27.198
You are never
Sending my daughter.

08:27.200 --> 08:28.598
To some boot camp In oregon.

08:28.600 --> 08:30.132
Yeah, well,
She's my daughter, too.

08:30.134 --> 08:32.398

08:44.600 --> 08:47.132
I'd rather not, But sure.

08:47.134 --> 08:48.532
Now, you know you're about
To meet a bunch.

08:48.534 --> 08:49.865
Of very old church ladies.

08:49.867 --> 08:52.132
Who are going to ask
Where you've been, mister.

08:52.134 --> 08:54.598
All your life? Every sunday.

08:54.600 --> 08:56.398
Well, I'll just tell them
I've been somewhere.

08:56.400 --> 08:57.798
Near the corner
Of sportscenter and the bed.

08:57.800 --> 08:59.132
You know you're going
To have to come to church.

08:59.134 --> 09:01.332
At some point, right?
I know you keep saying that.

09:01.334 --> 09:03.865
Okay, so what's it going to
Take to get you to come?

09:03.867 --> 09:04.998
Ooh. Stop it.

09:05.000 --> 09:06.265
Okay, to church?

09:06.267 --> 09:07.732
Yes. Okay, I...

09:07.734 --> 09:09.732
I know what might sway me.

09:09.734 --> 09:11.132
Drove by ebenezer Last sunday.

09:11.134 --> 09:12.465
They had a really
Interesting thing.

09:12.467 --> 09:13.532
What was it?

09:13.534 --> 09:15.465
Free car wash.

09:15.467 --> 09:17.732
You get the water spots out
My hood and touch up the chrome,

09:17.734 --> 09:19.198
I'd come...

09:19.200 --> 09:21.332
Or at least until they'd
Text me and told me it was done.

09:21.334 --> 09:23.465
You're lucky I'm christian.

09:23.467 --> 09:26.565
We agree on that.

09:26.567 --> 09:30.098
<i>Voicemail The mailbox you are
attempting to reach is full.</i>

09:30.100 --> 09:31.432
She's still Not picking up.

09:31.434 --> 09:34.265
What do you want to do?

09:34.267 --> 09:35.932
Let's just call the cops.

09:35.934 --> 09:39.665
That would be
The nuclear option.

09:39.667 --> 09:42.665
She's basically
Kidnapping my son.

09:42.667 --> 09:45.132
Kevin, Once you go that route,

09:45.134 --> 09:47.898
Things could get
Real messy fast.

09:47.900 --> 09:49.732
Are you sure You want that?

09:49.734 --> 09:51.998
I mean, She is nathan's mother.

10:01.067 --> 10:04.132
Excuse me, bishop.
Mr. Thompson is here.

10:04.134 --> 10:06.065
Percy lee thompson,

10:06.067 --> 10:08.398
I'm so glad
They let your old bones.

10:08.400 --> 10:10.265
Out that cemetery
To come and see me.

10:10.267 --> 10:12.398
Now, the only reason
I was in that cemetery.

10:12.400 --> 10:15.132
Was waiting for your
Old bones to arrive.

10:15.134 --> 10:16.932
Well, my bones are fine.

10:16.934 --> 10:18.932
It does my heart good
To see you, old friend.

10:18.934 --> 10:20.598
It's good to be seen.

10:20.600 --> 10:22.265
How long has it been?

10:22.267 --> 10:23.598
Charity's wedding.

10:23.600 --> 10:25.798
Ooh, I've missed you.

10:25.800 --> 10:27.265
James, you told me On the phone.

10:27.267 --> 10:28.665
That this was going
To be a party.

10:28.667 --> 10:30.865
You didn't say it was going
To be such a gala occasion.

10:30.867 --> 10:32.532
Well, it isn't, Actually.

10:32.534 --> 10:35.865
Um, every year, we thank
The bishop's roundtable.

10:35.867 --> 10:37.332
For their service
And generosity.

10:37.334 --> 10:39.532
It's kind of a tradition.

10:39.534 --> 10:40.665
Yeah, But it's a tradition.

10:40.667 --> 10:42.532
It has nothing to do
With percy lee thompson.

10:42.534 --> 10:45.265
Now, you know, last time
I stepped foot in a church,

10:45.267 --> 10:48.265
I was hiding from an angry
Father with a shotgun.

10:48.267 --> 10:52.665
Well, there is a reason
I wanted you here.

10:52.667 --> 10:56.499
Man, I've been having trouble
Lately, well, more than trouble,

10:56.501 --> 10:57.699
And I thought I would
Use this occasion.

10:57.701 --> 11:02.531
To take one last time
To bridge the gap,

11:02.533 --> 11:03.999
And since you're the one
Who introduced us,

11:04.001 --> 11:06.465
I thought, well, maybe,
Maybe she'll listen to you.

11:06.467 --> 11:08.165
Percy lee?

11:13.067 --> 11:14.998
My goodness.

11:19.334 --> 11:20.831
What are you doing here?

11:32.334 --> 11:33.398
I thought you were too busy.

11:33.400 --> 11:35.798
To be bothered
With your old friends.

11:35.800 --> 11:37.798
Well, if my people
Can't find a way.

11:37.800 --> 11:39.798
To run a funeral home
For a few hours,

11:39.800 --> 11:41.332
Then shame on them.

11:41.334 --> 11:42.598
As if you would let
Anybody there.

11:42.600 --> 11:44.532
Make a decision Without you.

11:44.534 --> 11:47.398
Well, whatever,
We're just happy to have you.

11:47.400 --> 11:49.598
It just brings me
Back to the old days.

11:49.600 --> 11:51.932
When we had those
Delicious shoulder sandwiches.

11:51.934 --> 11:54.199
And coleslaw At hawkin's grill.

11:54.201 --> 11:56.631
Don't forget the beer,
Ice-cold beer.

11:56.633 --> 11:57.765
Yes.

11:57.767 --> 12:00.665
Now, if you two
Haven't gotten too fancy,

12:00.667 --> 12:02.665
Perhaps you can point me
In the direction.

12:02.667 --> 12:04.265
Of where I can Go to get one.

12:04.267 --> 12:05.332
Well, They're still setting up,

12:05.334 --> 12:07.132
But the, the bar
Is straight in the back.

12:07.134 --> 12:09.398
I'm sure they'll
Find you a cold one.

12:09.400 --> 12:13.132
- Mae?
- Yes, please, help yourself.

12:16.567 --> 12:19.298
First jacob and kerissa,
Now percy lee?

12:19.300 --> 12:21.432
James, What is going on here?

12:21.434 --> 12:22.898
Nothing.

12:22.900 --> 12:26.132
I talked to percy last night.
He said he was free.

12:26.134 --> 12:28.532
Well, if that's all it is,
Fine, but...

12:28.534 --> 12:30.332
But what?

12:30.334 --> 12:35.232
We're done, james,
So whatever is going on tonight,

12:35.234 --> 12:36.998
We're done.

12:37.000 --> 12:38.365
I made up my mind.

12:42.467 --> 12:44.065
Karine.

12:46.700 --> 12:48.265
Karine,
Would you please have them.

12:48.267 --> 12:52.798
Make all of the bouquets bigger,
Grand, every flower we have?

12:52.800 --> 12:54.665
Karine Yes, first lady.

12:57.567 --> 12:59.165
I mean it, james.

13:04.667 --> 13:06.865
I want it to be spectacular.

13:15.400 --> 13:19.265
Welcome. Thank you.
Make yourselves at home.

13:19.267 --> 13:21.132
Always glad. Thanks.

13:23.667 --> 13:25.065
Son.

13:29.100 --> 13:31.965
Clara So where have
You been hiding him?

13:31.967 --> 13:34.899
I haven't seen you At calvary.

13:34.901 --> 13:36.765
I cover religion
For the statesmen,

13:36.767 --> 13:38.632
And I'm usually On assignment.

13:38.634 --> 13:40.931
Well, I supposed
It's a good thing

13:40.933 --> 13:43.732
I haven't seen you
Snooping around calvary then.

13:43.734 --> 13:45.798
Mae, mae. Yes, clara.

13:45.800 --> 13:49.598
You must have been so proud
Seeing grace on the front page.

13:49.600 --> 13:50.798
What was that headline?

13:50.800 --> 13:52.532
"The women changing
Memphis megachurches."

13:52.534 --> 13:54.232
Yes, I'm so proud.

13:54.234 --> 13:56.365
I... I was just on my way
To have some shrimp.

13:56.367 --> 13:57.832
Have you tried them, Clara?

13:57.834 --> 13:59.565
Well, there's nothing
Wrong with my legs.

13:59.567 --> 14:01.132
I'll go walk
Over there with you.

14:01.134 --> 14:03.732
Yes.

14:03.734 --> 14:06.398
Didn't I tell you?

14:12.600 --> 14:14.932
Hold on. I'll be right back.

14:19.000 --> 14:21.331
Kevin, What are you doing here?

14:21.333 --> 14:23.331
Looking for charity.
Is she here?

14:23.333 --> 14:24.998
No. She's on tour.

14:25.000 --> 14:27.131
Yeah, You sure about that?

14:27.133 --> 14:28.999
I think so. Bishop said
She quit for a minute,

14:29.001 --> 14:30.998
But she went right back. Why?

14:31.000 --> 14:32.999
Because she's ignoring
My phone calls,

14:33.001 --> 14:34.199
And I finally got
In touch with jabari,

14:34.201 --> 14:37.399
And the tour is in raleigh,
And she's not with him.

14:37.401 --> 14:38.399
She's not here.

14:38.401 --> 14:40.665
Then where is she?

14:40.667 --> 14:42.665
You know, let's just
Call her, okay?

14:42.667 --> 14:44.998
Come on. Come on.
Let's give her a call.

14:54.134 --> 14:56.598
Can I get you a cocktail?

14:56.600 --> 14:59.398
Can I have a georgia peach?

15:10.200 --> 15:11.132
Hey, sis.

15:11.134 --> 15:12.732
Hey, where are you?

15:12.734 --> 15:14.132
On tour.

15:14.134 --> 15:16.698
Okay, well, I'm here with kevin.

15:16.700 --> 15:18.532
Where? He's at the house.

15:18.534 --> 15:20.798
He's looking for you, Baby.

15:20.800 --> 15:22.565
Of course he is.

15:22.567 --> 15:24.865
He said he talked to jabari
And that you're not on tour,

15:24.867 --> 15:27.299
But I told him
That we all know that you are.

15:27.301 --> 15:31.598
Yeah, well, that didn't
Really work out.

15:31.600 --> 15:32.465
Where are you?

15:32.467 --> 15:34.265
I'm tcob-ing.

15:34.267 --> 15:36.665
I'm taking care Of business.

15:36.667 --> 15:39.732
Are you by a pool?
Grace, I'm doing what I want.

15:39.734 --> 15:43.465
Kevin did what he wanted,
So I can do the same.

15:46.667 --> 15:48.865
Is nathan with you?

15:48.867 --> 15:52.932
They have trained,
Registered nannies, grace,

15:52.934 --> 15:56.232
So don't start acting like
I'm some kind of negligent mama.

15:56.234 --> 15:57.432
All right.
Just give me the phone, grace.

15:57.434 --> 15:59.365
- He wants to talk to you.
- Yeah, well, I'm busy.

15:59.367 --> 16:00.998
She says she's busy.
All right. Give me that thing.

16:01.000 --> 16:02.265
What?

16:02.267 --> 16:03.965
Charity.

16:06.634 --> 16:08.698
She hung up. That's it.
We're calling the cops.

16:08.700 --> 16:11.232
Hey, kevin, wait.
Just please don't.

16:11.234 --> 16:12.932
She's not giving me
A choice, grace.

16:12.934 --> 16:14.065
It's only been A few days.

16:14.067 --> 16:16.332
It's been over a week.

16:16.334 --> 16:18.398
Hey, listen to me.

16:18.400 --> 16:20.531
You know that you've had
Your moments, okay?

16:20.533 --> 16:24.065
Just give her A beat, please.

16:31.800 --> 16:33.598
Please don't let him
Call the cops.

16:33.600 --> 16:35.332
It's not up to me...

16:35.334 --> 16:36.665
Aaron.

16:36.667 --> 16:39.398
But I hear you. I'll do my best.

16:42.934 --> 16:45.465
You say I'm too harsh, but you
Want to send her to a boot camp?

16:45.467 --> 16:47.065
It's not a boot camp, Jacob.

16:47.067 --> 16:48.998
It's a behavior
Modification program.

16:49.000 --> 16:51.198
It works, and they have
Counselors there.

16:51.200 --> 16:53.798
With experience handling
Tough cases like this.

16:53.800 --> 16:57.198
You handle difficult kids
And parents every day.

16:57.200 --> 16:58.598
They didn't just show up
To excellence.

16:58.600 --> 16:59.998
Already being excellent.

17:00.000 --> 17:01.132
This is different.

17:01.134 --> 17:02.998
We don't know how to
Get through to zora.

17:03.000 --> 17:04.598
She needs Professional help.

17:04.599 --> 17:07.397
Baby, this oregon stuff
Just sounds like.

17:07.400 --> 17:10.732
Some mind-control,
Weird, white-people nonsense.

17:10.733 --> 17:12.132
I'm not going to
Throw my money away.

17:12.134 --> 17:14.732
So she can go frolic
About a lake with some beavers.

17:14.733 --> 17:19.932
I think We should just...

17:19.934 --> 17:21.897
So what are you two over here
Talking about.

17:21.900 --> 17:23.765
That's got you Looking so grim?

17:24.733 --> 17:26.464
Well, your son
Was just making fun of me.

17:26.467 --> 17:28.598
For drinking port wine.

17:28.600 --> 17:32.332
Says I might as well be eating
A whole pie, it's so sweet.

17:32.334 --> 17:34.798
Yeah, I don't Really get port.

17:38.534 --> 17:40.532
Excuse us.

17:59.267 --> 18:02.598
Now, that is my favorite
Of the two of you.

18:02.600 --> 18:06.598
- Look how little winkie is.
- I know, so adorable.

18:08.534 --> 18:10.865
How you holding up, Mama?

18:10.867 --> 18:13.065
No. I'm the mother.

18:13.067 --> 18:15.265
I get to ask The questions.

18:15.267 --> 18:18.998
What is going on
Between you and kerissa?

18:19.000 --> 18:21.065
You can tell me.

18:23.334 --> 18:25.132
She wants to send
Zora off to oregon.

18:25.134 --> 18:27.465
To some boot camp
For troubled kids.

18:27.467 --> 18:30.132
Oregon? Yeah.

18:30.134 --> 18:35.065
We caught her stealing from
The offering plate at triumph.

18:44.000 --> 18:48.132
You all should bring her
To me for a while.

18:48.134 --> 18:50.465
Okay. I actually love that idea.

18:50.467 --> 18:52.199
Yep, because that child
Would not dare.

18:52.201 --> 18:55.398
Disrespect me In my house.

18:55.400 --> 18:57.365
I'll bring it up to kerissa.

18:57.367 --> 19:01.132
Perfect. That's settled.

19:08.267 --> 19:10.265
James Come on in.

19:11.800 --> 19:15.499
Come on in, everyone,
Gather around.

19:20.467 --> 19:23.132
Mae, if you will.

19:33.400 --> 19:38.465
Ecclesiastes 49 teaches us
That two is better than one.

19:38.467 --> 19:41.499
Because they have good reward
For their labor.

19:41.501 --> 19:45.865
If they fall,
The one lifts up his fellow.

19:45.867 --> 19:49.598
If they lie together,
They have heat,

19:49.600 --> 19:55.165
But how can one Be warm alone?

19:55.167 --> 19:59.565
The bishop's roundtable has long
Been a partner with this church,

19:59.567 --> 20:03.532
An ever-present partner
In good times and in bad.

20:03.534 --> 20:05.199
All Amen.

20:05.201 --> 20:06.865
Mae and I have counted on you.

20:06.867 --> 20:10.198
All in ways too numerous
To mention.

20:10.200 --> 20:12.665
And too important to forget,

20:12.667 --> 20:16.331
So we've called you here
To say thank you.

20:16.333 --> 20:17.265
Amen.

20:17.267 --> 20:19.865
But I want to say
One more thing

20:19.867 --> 20:21.532
I want my children
And grandchildren.

20:21.534 --> 20:23.465
To come forward
For this, please.

20:33.267 --> 20:36.798
When I was young, I didn't know
The lord's plan for my life.

20:36.800 --> 20:38.798
I thought I was going to be
A lonely preacher.

20:38.800 --> 20:43.332
Traveling from town to town
Because I'd never met a woman.

20:43.334 --> 20:46.998
Who took her faith
As seriously as I took mine.

20:47.000 --> 20:48.532
But god intervened!

20:48.534 --> 20:52.898
Amen. Indeed he did,
In the form of you, percy,

20:52.900 --> 20:56.799
Who introduced me
To a certain young woman.

20:56.801 --> 21:00.798
Whose piety impressed me
So completely that I...

21:00.800 --> 21:03.265
I turned my back
On my lonely vision of the road.

21:03.267 --> 21:07.198
And inclined My soul to hers.

21:07.200 --> 21:15.032
Mae, I have fallen often
On life's journey,

21:15.034 --> 21:16.898
But ever since
The good lord saw fit.

21:16.900 --> 21:22.132
To send you To light my path,

21:22.134 --> 21:30.134
I have never felt forsaken,
Cold or unsure,

21:31.067 --> 21:35.398
And if god spare my life,

21:35.400 --> 21:39.332
I intend to spend
The next 40-plus years.

21:39.334 --> 21:44.032
The same way I spent the last,

21:44.034 --> 21:48.665
In love with you.

21:52.400 --> 21:56.798
This church, this family,

21:56.800 --> 22:00.265
Which my loving wife
And I have built together,

22:00.267 --> 22:05.498
Lo these many beautiful years,
Let no man pull asunder.

22:38.701 --> 22:40.931
That was just beautiful.

22:40.933 --> 22:42.598
The bishop loves His first lady.

22:42.600 --> 22:45.331
And I daresay
That you set the bar.

22:45.333 --> 22:47.998
For romance Pretty high there.

22:48.000 --> 22:50.731
- Anytime.
- Thanks.

22:52.267 --> 22:54.998
I'm not leaving this house until
I can raid that closet of yours.

22:55.000 --> 22:57.532
You look very nice, too.

22:57.534 --> 22:58.731
Well, thank you so much.

22:58.733 --> 23:00.133

To keep up with you.

23:01.934 --> 23:04.031
Now, who is this, bae?

23:04.033 --> 23:05.431

23:10.134 --> 23:12.665

Where she's been hiding him.

Well, she's just Being sensible.

23:15.667 --> 23:17.831
She knows she bring
A treat around like this,

23:20.767 --> 23:23.698

23:23.700 --> 23:25.432
I don't know, And I don't...

23:25.434 --> 23:27.098
I'll take care of it.

23:29.200 --> 23:31.199
Have you read that new
Article on our grace?

To one of her funds.

23:41.267 --> 23:42.865

For new donors.

23:42.867 --> 23:44.732

I'm still A member of calvary.

24:47.467 --> 24:49.332
Whole roundtable is here.

24:54.434 --> 24:57.765
Surely you must know
What it looks like.

24:57.767 --> 24:59.032
Rochelle You have to understand
What it would look like.

24:59.034 --> 25:01.065
If I wasn't here.

25:02.567 --> 25:06.198
James, nothing happened
Between us.

25:06.200 --> 25:08.132
What, do you except me
To just slink off into the night.

25:08.134 --> 25:09.332
Like some Shameful secret?

25:09.334 --> 25:10.599
It's not about secrets.

25:10.601 --> 25:13.398
You called me and asked me
To meet you at the biltmore...

25:13.400 --> 25:14.465
Rochelle.

25:14.467 --> 25:17.265
When you know
I'm in love with you.

25:17.267 --> 25:18.299
Rochelle, please.

25:18.301 --> 25:20.565
No. You let me finish.

25:20.567 --> 25:23.299
I can't continue to act
Like you pulling me in.

25:23.301 --> 25:25.532
And pushing me away
Doesn't hurt.

25:28.500 --> 25:29.898
Forgive me
If I haven't been clear.

25:29.900 --> 25:32.965
"Clear," like the way
You held me in your arms.

25:32.967 --> 25:34.765
Like you wanted To kiss me.

25:34.767 --> 25:37.432
As you told me
You loved your wife.

25:37.434 --> 25:40.365
Or maybe the way you told me
To stay away while looking at me.

25:40.367 --> 25:44.865
Like a man dying of thirst
In front of water.

25:44.867 --> 25:47.732
Bishop, I've been very clear.

25:47.734 --> 25:51.165
You've been anything but.

25:51.167 --> 25:52.899
I thought I was.

25:56.400 --> 25:58.998
And if I haven't been,

25:59.000 --> 26:02.398
Well, if I've given you
Some reason to hope,

26:02.400 --> 26:06.798
I...

26:06.800 --> 26:09.065
I'm sorry.

26:44.267 --> 26:47.031
She's leaving.

26:47.033 --> 26:50.932
Why are you Talking to me?

26:50.934 --> 26:56.598
Your business is
Clearly with her, not me.

26:56.600 --> 27:00.532
Like I told you, james...

27:00.534 --> 27:02.165
We're done.

27:07.334 --> 27:10.598
Clara, my dear,
Let me show you what we did.

27:10.600 --> 27:14.665
It is so...

27:27.667 --> 27:29.065
Good night, clara.

27:29.067 --> 27:30.598
You taking off so soon?

27:30.600 --> 27:33.265
Well, you know what they say.
Money never sleeps.

27:35.334 --> 27:37.265
I'm, I'm sorry. Excuse me.

27:37.267 --> 27:38.865
Do you mind if I have
A word with you?

27:38.867 --> 27:40.265
Sure. Okay.

27:40.267 --> 27:42.798
Excuse me.

27:42.800 --> 27:44.465
Let me know
If you change your mind.

27:44.467 --> 27:46.332
On donating Into grace's fund.

27:46.334 --> 27:48.332
We'll see, Maybe next year.

27:48.334 --> 27:50.265
It does sound
Like a worthy cause.

27:52.667 --> 27:54.632
If you don't Mind me asking,

27:54.634 --> 27:58.698
What does the church
Have you tied up in?

27:58.700 --> 28:01.732
If you weren't
In the roundtable, I'd tell you,

28:01.734 --> 28:06.199
But it's a personal matter
With bishop and lady mae.

28:06.201 --> 28:08.332
Well, I hope
They're not in trouble.

28:08.334 --> 28:12.332
I... they seem so blissfully
Happy, almost puzzling so.

28:12.334 --> 28:16.798
Um, you sure You can't say?

28:16.800 --> 28:19.265
I really can't say.

28:19.267 --> 28:23.798
God knows I love my bishop,
But if I was your money manager,

28:23.800 --> 28:27.965
I would definitely advise you
To vet out whatever it is.

28:27.967 --> 28:30.132
And just make sure
You're protected.

28:32.934 --> 28:35.631
Thank you. Have a good night.

28:35.633 --> 28:37.565
Good night.

28:42.600 --> 28:46.265
Sorry about the phone thing,
But I got your tv back.

28:46.267 --> 28:47.532
Can I get some credit
For that at least?

28:47.534 --> 28:49.998
My tv didn't last long.

28:50.000 --> 28:52.732
My dad thinks I'm taking
From the collection, so...

28:52.734 --> 28:55.532
Are you? No.

28:55.534 --> 28:57.932
So where did you Get that money.

28:57.934 --> 28:59.598
You wanted me to buy
The phone with from?

28:59.600 --> 29:00.999
It was leftover cash
From my birthday.

29:01.001 --> 29:02.865
I'm not a thief, sophia.

29:02.867 --> 29:05.265
Okay, okay.

29:05.267 --> 29:06.798
My dad, like, Went hulk on me.

29:06.800 --> 29:11.298
He was, like, busting open my
Drawers, almost broke my lamp.

29:11.300 --> 29:12.532
Wow, that's messed up.

29:12.534 --> 29:13.998
Yeah.

29:14.000 --> 29:15.398
You okay?

29:15.400 --> 29:18.532
I'll be fine.

29:18.534 --> 29:19.998
Ready?

29:20.000 --> 29:22.532
Yeah. We're going to go take
A walk down by the lake.

29:22.534 --> 29:25.298
Want to come?
No, thanks. I'm fine.

29:32.734 --> 29:35.665
I don't know. It's just
It's that same thing...

29:35.667 --> 29:36.865
- Grace.
- Ma'am?

29:36.867 --> 29:37.865
Was that kevin satterlee

29:37.867 --> 29:39.665
I saw you speaking
With a few moments ago?

29:39.667 --> 29:40.732
You know it was.

29:40.734 --> 29:42.265
Do you know Where he went?

29:42.267 --> 29:43.265
Ma'am, he left.

29:43.267 --> 29:46.732
I was hoping To talk to him.

29:46.734 --> 29:52.065
Ms. Connie, about what,
If I may ask?

29:52.067 --> 29:54.198
Why he stopped
Coming to calvary.

29:54.200 --> 29:55.598
His son is a member.

29:55.600 --> 29:57.899
Even if he and charity
Are no longer a couple.

29:57.901 --> 30:01.032
Well, perhaps if we join the
Open and inclusive coalition,

30:01.034 --> 30:02.032
He'll come back.

30:02.034 --> 30:03.832
He's perfectly Free to come now.

30:03.834 --> 30:05.565
As long as he hides Who he is.

30:05.567 --> 30:07.365
No one asks him
To hide anything.

30:07.367 --> 30:08.965
No. They don't.

30:08.967 --> 30:13.365
They just expect it,
Demand it, really.

30:13.367 --> 30:15.899
Same old grace.

30:15.901 --> 30:19.465
I just wonder who is going
To be filling those pews.

30:19.467 --> 30:21.165
It worries me, too.

30:21.167 --> 30:24.499
Then why don't we
Join the coalition?

30:24.501 --> 30:26.431
There are thousands Of gay,

30:26.433 --> 30:28.231
Lesbian and transgender
People in memphis.

30:28.233 --> 30:30.832
Who are looking
For a church home.

30:30.834 --> 30:33.232
The fact that
We don't welcome them...

30:37.234 --> 30:39.898
What?

30:39.900 --> 30:41.298
Just keep praying That one day.

30:41.300 --> 30:44.132
You'll outgrow that old habit
Of agitating.

30:44.134 --> 30:46.065
For every underdog But jesus.

30:49.934 --> 30:51.798
Every underdog is jesus.

30:55.800 --> 30:57.998
Excuse me.

31:08.567 --> 31:12.132
- Night, connie.
- Good night.

31:12.134 --> 31:14.265
Fresh glass.

31:14.267 --> 31:15.665
Thank you.

31:18.467 --> 31:21.365
What's with all The smiles?

31:21.367 --> 31:24.065
Well, my mother gave the best
Advice of about zora hands down.

31:24.067 --> 31:26.799
I'm scared to hear. What was it?

31:26.801 --> 31:28.698
She said she can Stay with her.

31:28.700 --> 31:30.065
No.

31:30.067 --> 31:31.198
She can handle her, Keke.

31:31.200 --> 31:32.465
I don't need Your mother's help.

31:32.467 --> 31:33.932
You?

31:33.934 --> 31:35.598
Baby, we need
A bible-based environment,

31:35.600 --> 31:37.198
Not some blair witch project
In the woods.

31:37.200 --> 31:39.398
Stop it. I don't like it.

31:39.400 --> 31:42.332
Zora listens to my mother,
And mom will keep her in check.

31:42.334 --> 31:44.232
Just like she did me
And my sisters.

31:44.234 --> 31:45.832
Like she kept Faith in check?

31:45.834 --> 31:46.965
That's out of line.

31:46.967 --> 31:48.998
And what do you call
Discussing our family matters.

31:49.000 --> 31:50.065
With your mother?

31:50.067 --> 31:52.265
It's family.

31:53.134 --> 31:54.865
You know what? I'm ready to go.

31:54.867 --> 31:58.598
I'm going To go get our kids.

31:58.600 --> 32:00.865
I'm sorry.

32:20.134 --> 32:23.999
Soft beat,

32:39.734 --> 32:42.465
Wait, stop, stop.

32:45.267 --> 32:48.598
What's wrong?

32:48.600 --> 32:51.932
Let's just go back inside.

32:53.067 --> 32:54.467
I think I'm just
Going to head home.

32:56.534 --> 32:57.665
Don't be mad.

32:57.667 --> 33:00.532
I'm not. I'll call you later.

33:17.334 --> 33:19.265
Hey, I was just
Checking up on some new

33:19.267 --> 33:22.798
Netflix stuff, Hope that's okay.

33:22.800 --> 33:25.865
Well, sorry.

33:25.867 --> 33:28.332
No. It's not that.

33:28.334 --> 33:31.132
It's roberto.

33:31.134 --> 33:33.198
I think he wants
To have sex with me.

33:33.200 --> 33:35.132
Whoa, that's so weird.

33:35.134 --> 33:36.998
Right? I mean,
I thought I was going...

33:37.000 --> 33:39.098
Girl, I'm joking.

33:39.100 --> 33:42.665
There is literally
Nothing weird about that.

33:42.667 --> 33:44.498
But I want to wait
Until marriage.

33:44.500 --> 33:46.431
Why?

33:46.433 --> 33:50.298
Because the bible
Is so clear about...

33:50.300 --> 33:52.699
Look, I'll show you.

33:55.667 --> 33:58.065
Who is cashmoney2995?

33:58.067 --> 34:03.265
That's, um, you know
Calvin from school, right?

34:03.267 --> 34:04.732
Why are you still
Talking to isaiah?

34:04.734 --> 34:05.698
What's the matter with you?

34:05.700 --> 34:06.998
What's the matter with you?

34:07.000 --> 34:08.465
He hits you, zora!

34:08.467 --> 34:09.931
He talks to you like a child,
And he embarrasses you.

34:09.934 --> 34:12.465
He loves me.

34:12.467 --> 34:15.965
No. That is not love, zora.

34:15.967 --> 34:17.998
And what do you know about love,
Ms. Goody two-shoes?

34:18.001 --> 34:20.197
And you want to talk
About embarrassing?

34:20.199 --> 34:21.398
You embarrass me.

34:21.400 --> 34:22.797
You embarrassed me
At the cotillion,

34:22.800 --> 34:24.065
And you're Embarrassing me now.

34:24.067 --> 34:25.864
I'm embarrassed
To know your ass.

34:25.867 --> 34:26.899
Why would you Even say that?

34:26.900 --> 34:29.297
Because it's true.

34:29.300 --> 34:30.764
We used to have
So much fun together,

34:30.766 --> 34:33.165
And you used to be cool,
And now you're not.

34:33.167 --> 34:34.431
Every time I talk to you,

34:34.434 --> 34:36.797
You suck the life
Out of me, sophia.

34:36.800 --> 34:39.732
Every time we talk,
It's "Christian this" and...

34:39.734 --> 34:41.931
And "Bible that."

34:41.934 --> 34:44.465
I'm starting to wonder
If you even believe.

34:44.467 --> 34:47.598
Why do you keep trying
To convince everybody...

34:47.600 --> 34:48.998
I'm not trying
To convince everybody.

34:49.000 --> 34:50.665
- Yes, yes, yes, you are.
- No. I'm not trying to convince.

34:50.667 --> 34:52.132
Everybody.
I'm just happy to be saved,

34:52.134 --> 34:53.764
And maybe if you weren't
So distracted.

34:53.766 --> 34:57.799
By this pile of trash,
You'd be happy, too.

34:59.900 --> 35:01.532
Do you even remember
What that feels like?

35:01.534 --> 35:03.532
Yeah, yeah, I do.

35:03.534 --> 35:06.732
All I got to do is think of
A time before I knew you,

35:06.734 --> 35:09.932
And "Pile of trash," Okay,

35:09.934 --> 35:12.665
Is that how god's Little bitch.

35:12.667 --> 35:16.332
Likes to show love
To all mankind?

35:16.334 --> 35:18.465
What did you call me?

35:18.467 --> 35:20.332
God's little bitch.

35:20.334 --> 35:22.065
What, you deaf now?

35:22.067 --> 35:27.932
Is... is your head so far up
Your ass you can't hear?

35:27.934 --> 35:29.799
I could really
Slap you right now.

35:29.801 --> 35:33.665
Go ahead, z. Let's see
How well he taught you.

35:35.534 --> 35:39.698
Go ahead. Do it.

35:39.700 --> 35:42.465
Girls, hey, girls! Hey! Stop it!

35:42.467 --> 35:45.732
Let go. Stop it right now.

35:45.734 --> 35:47.432
What has gotten Into you two?

35:53.767 --> 35:57.465
You... you were Looking at that?

35:57.467 --> 35:58.665
Was she looking at that?

36:05.034 --> 36:09.398
What is this plan?
What is this all about?

36:09.400 --> 36:11.465
If you think that you're
Moving out when you turn 18,

36:11.467 --> 36:13.165
You need to think again.

36:13.167 --> 36:15.165
You have no choice.

36:15.167 --> 36:17.698
Once I turn 18, I'm going,
And I'm going to be with isaiah,

36:17.700 --> 36:19.065
And it doesn't matter
What you, dad...

36:19.067 --> 36:22.198
You better get your hand
Out my face, little girl.

36:22.200 --> 36:26.732
Or anybody else Can do about it.

36:34.000 --> 36:35.932
Thank you.

36:35.934 --> 36:37.632
I cannot thank you and bishop...
Ooh.

36:37.634 --> 36:40.632
Enough for such
A festive evening,

36:40.634 --> 36:42.798
But my granddaughter here
Seems to think

36:42.800 --> 36:45.865
I've had enough bubbles
For one evening.

36:45.867 --> 36:48.332
We will be toasting Again soon.

36:48.334 --> 36:51.899
Won't we, clara?
In a couple of weeks?

36:51.901 --> 36:54.298
I'm glad You brought that up.

36:54.300 --> 36:56.365
I'm thinking
It might be wise for us.

36:56.367 --> 36:59.065
To sit down
With my money people,

36:59.067 --> 37:00.999
You, me, bishop,

37:01.001 --> 37:05.332
Go over this transfer
Of funds one more time...

37:06.400 --> 37:08.532
Just to get
A sober look at things.

37:08.534 --> 37:11.532
In the light of day?

37:14.800 --> 37:17.065
You ready, karine? Yes, grandma.

37:17.067 --> 37:21.598
Well, clara, bishop and I
Will be more than happy.

37:21.600 --> 37:23.932
To sit down
With your money people.

37:23.934 --> 37:26.598
Good. Yes.

37:26.600 --> 37:29.165
And, karine, you will let me
Know when that's on the books.

37:29.167 --> 37:29.999
Will do.

37:30.001 --> 37:31.665
You did a wonderful Job tonight.

37:31.667 --> 37:33.332
Thank you. Thank you.
Come on, grandma.

37:33.334 --> 37:35.599
Good night, dear.

37:35.601 --> 37:36.998
We'll talk soon.

37:37.000 --> 37:38.932
All right. Good night.

37:38.934 --> 37:41.865
Good night.

38:07.934 --> 38:09.732
Grace Connie.

38:09.734 --> 38:10.698
May I?

38:10.700 --> 38:13.932
Please.

38:13.934 --> 38:14.932
Don't tell me, The deacon board.

38:14.934 --> 38:16.465
Has decided to join
The coalition?

38:16.467 --> 38:18.732
No.

38:18.734 --> 38:21.065
But could you see
Yourself running a church.

38:21.067 --> 38:23.465
That wasn't a member
Of the coalition?

38:23.467 --> 38:24.831
Why would you ask me that?

38:24.833 --> 38:26.199
Have you seen the news?

38:29.001 --> 38:30.465
I was just reading it.

38:30.467 --> 38:32.965
Things between your parents have
Been complicated for a while.

38:32.967 --> 38:36.165
And now with this irs thing...

38:36.167 --> 38:37.499
I'm listening.

38:37.501 --> 38:40.631
We obviously see
The christian faith.

38:40.633 --> 38:43.365
A little differently, Grace.

38:43.367 --> 38:48.098
Wish I had a better option,
A more biblically sound option,

38:48.100 --> 38:50.132
But I am no fool.

38:50.134 --> 38:54.065
Calvary is greenleaf,

38:54.067 --> 38:56.932
And in the event
That things between your parents.

38:56.934 --> 39:00.198
Take yet another turn
For the worst,

39:00.200 --> 39:03.798
The deacons may ask you
To step up.

39:03.800 --> 39:05.399
Step up?

39:05.401 --> 39:07.265
Take over as head pastor.

39:10.833 --> 39:12.632
What do you say?

39:23.467 --> 39:26.232
Hey, grandma.
Ta-da, zora's room.

39:30.934 --> 39:34.299
Zora greenleaf,
You get yourself over here.

39:34.301 --> 39:37.199
And give your mother
And father a proper goodbye.

39:50.067 --> 39:52.198
Thanks, mama.
We really appreciate this.

39:52.200 --> 39:54.198
I know it's a weird time.

39:54.200 --> 39:57.865
No. If anything, baby,
I'm inspired.

40:01.534 --> 40:04.398
Aw.

40:04.400 --> 40:09.465
Listen, I promise you I am
Going to get through to her.

40:12.600 --> 40:16.198
Sweetheart.

40:16.200 --> 40:18.132
Thanks, ma.

40:18.134 --> 40:19.598
I'll call you. Okay.

40:19.600 --> 40:21.665
All right.

41:27.000 --> 41:29.732
You have a voice
Like darlene love.

41:29.734 --> 41:31.332
You're the background Singer?

41:31.334 --> 41:34.198
Ma'am, are you

41:34.200 --> 41:36.398
