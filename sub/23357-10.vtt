00:05.101 --> 00:07.577
<i>I took this at Lane's clinic.</i>

00:07.587 --> 00:09.846
Look at these dosages.
They are extremely high.

00:09.856 --> 00:11.614
<i>That's an awful accusation.</i>

00:11.624 --> 00:13.616
<i>I get it, she's your mentor.</i>

00:13.626 --> 00:15.079
But you got to trust me.

00:16.129 --> 00:17.954
The chemo was so strong this time.

00:17.964 --> 00:19.422
I'm worried about Lily.

00:19.432 --> 00:21.123
I don't get your obsession with this.

00:24.366 --> 00:25.895
There's something else going on.

00:29.507 --> 00:31.639
I'm dying. Please.

00:31.650 --> 00:33.349
Please help me.

00:35.115 --> 00:36.163
<i>Charge to 200.</i>

00:36.174 --> 00:37.273
Clear.

00:38.785 --> 00:40.643
<i>- Ready.</i>
<i>- Charge to 200.</i>

00:40.653 --> 00:42.812
<i>Clear.</i>

00:42.822 --> 00:44.547
<i>We lost her pulse.</i>

00:48.561 --> 00:51.621
Time of death...

00:51.631 --> 00:54.224
21:58.

01:01.474 --> 01:03.474
Watch where the hell you're going!

01:19.426 --> 01:21.651
God, what happened to you?

01:21.661 --> 01:24.320
- Nothing.
- You look like you got hit by a truck.

01:24.331 --> 01:25.360
I'm fine.

01:25.371 --> 01:27.323
Let me run an X-ray just to make sure...

01:27.333 --> 01:30.326
Sprained tibiofibular ligament.
Twisted ankle. Not necessary.

01:30.336 --> 01:32.062
Put it in an air stirrup for support...

01:32.072 --> 01:34.205
- I said I'm fine!
- Oh.

01:40.513 --> 01:42.906
Dr. Jacoby.

01:44.017 --> 01:46.579
Conrad Hawkins. How wonderful.

01:46.590 --> 01:48.378
You were one of my favorite students.

01:48.388 --> 01:50.713
- You work here now?
- Third year of my residency.

01:50.723 --> 01:52.865
Internal medicine. I was
just headed up to the floors.

01:52.876 --> 01:54.617
So proud of you.

01:54.627 --> 01:56.019
You're hurt.

01:56.029 --> 01:58.755
I fell. Running. It's no big deal.

01:58.765 --> 02:01.257
Oh. Exercise. Myself, I avoid it.

02:01.267 --> 02:03.359
That's good advice. I could've
used that an hour ago.

02:03.369 --> 02:06.204
Are you okay? Why are you here?

02:07.907 --> 02:10.407
I see ghosts.

02:28.085 --> 02:30.467
- Synced and corrected by Shazi89 -
- www.addic7ed.com -

02:30.478 --> 02:32.421
I need you to use
your best bedside manner.

02:32.432 --> 02:33.756
Really make him feel welcome.

02:33.766 --> 02:35.492
Have I ever let you down?

02:35.502 --> 02:38.328
The second richest man in China
is a very big get for Chastain.

02:38.338 --> 02:41.376
- Foreign VIPs pay full freight.
- Ted Zhou.

02:41.387 --> 02:44.134
Tumor in the caudate lobe of his
liver. Does he speak English?

02:44.144 --> 02:45.568
He went to Oxford, Dr. Bell.

02:45.578 --> 02:47.637
Well, I never heard of him.

02:47.647 --> 02:50.406
On the cover of <i> Forbes</i> and all
the gossip magazines in Asia.

02:50.416 --> 02:53.810
Sadly, I no longer subscribe
to Chinese gossip...

03:12.872 --> 03:16.299
Well, I'll have security
bring him around to the back.

03:17.677 --> 03:19.243
Guess I'll meet him upstairs.

03:28.688 --> 03:31.481
She was stable last night
when I left my shift.

03:31.491 --> 03:34.150
She was happy.

03:34.160 --> 03:36.553
I...

03:36.563 --> 03:39.155
I don't understand.

03:39.165 --> 03:41.291
It happened so fast.

03:42.535 --> 03:45.503
I went home.

03:47.507 --> 03:50.500
I left her alone. I should have
stayed here.

03:50.510 --> 03:52.402
You were at the end of a double shift.

03:52.412 --> 03:54.704
You can't be here
every second of every day.

03:54.714 --> 03:56.973
It wouldn't
have made a difference.

03:56.983 --> 04:00.009
She arrested, we coded her. Too long.

04:00.019 --> 04:02.553
Tried everything.

04:13.325 --> 04:16.291
They should've gotten rid
of this last night.

04:20.440 --> 04:22.265
You were with Lily last night?

04:22.275 --> 04:25.157
New patient. Room 5417.
Dr. Eileen Jacoby.

04:25.168 --> 04:26.798
Do we have any idea why she coded?

04:26.809 --> 04:28.607
She was a professor of
mine in med school.

04:28.618 --> 04:30.206
I'm just trying to make sense of it.

04:30.216 --> 04:31.941
Jacoby's important to me.

04:31.951 --> 04:34.043
Lily was my patient, too.

04:34.053 --> 04:36.587
Maybe we should talk about it.

04:38.625 --> 04:40.116
What happened to your ankle?

04:40.126 --> 04:41.970
Another question
people need to stop asking me.

04:41.981 --> 04:43.774
Okay, let's go to an exam room.
I'll wrap it.

04:43.785 --> 04:45.412
- You're not touching my ankle.
- I'm a doctor.

04:45.423 --> 04:46.915
That's the point. I've seen your work.

04:46.926 --> 04:48.758
Claire Thorpe wants us
in her office in an hour.

04:48.768 --> 04:50.059
Postmortem on Lily's code.

04:52.772 --> 04:54.530
He's punishing himself.

04:54.540 --> 04:57.775
He'll keep walking on it until it snaps.

05:05.051 --> 05:08.378
Hey. A bottle of Kenalog
rolled off the Mayo stand

05:08.388 --> 05:11.714
and broke. Bed 5124. Can I grab another?

05:11.724 --> 05:13.316
- Sure, let me check the computer.
- You don't need

05:13.326 --> 05:16.653
to look it up. I just need 30
milligrams to do a quick procedure.

05:16.663 --> 05:18.963
Okay.

05:21.663 --> 05:23.229
Here you go.

05:36.769 --> 05:39.976
Is it true that Eileen Jacoby
is here and she is your patient?

05:42.647 --> 05:44.973
When I was nine in Nigeria,

05:44.991 --> 05:49.519
I saw a news story about a
pioneering female neurosurgeon.

05:49.529 --> 05:51.802
Footage of her doing
brain surgery in the 1970s.

05:51.813 --> 05:54.297
All the other doctors were men,
and they tried to keep her out

05:54.308 --> 05:57.593
of the OR, but she was so good,
they couldn't.

05:57.603 --> 06:00.830
She did the first microscopic
AVM resection.

06:00.840 --> 06:05.034
Eileen Jacoby is the reason
I decided to become a surgeon.

06:05.044 --> 06:07.670
- You want to meet her?
- Yes.

06:07.680 --> 06:10.106
And if you introduce me to her,
I won't tell anyone

06:10.116 --> 06:11.341
you were shooting up in here.

06:11.351 --> 06:13.543
Yeah. It was cortisone.
Tell anyone you want.

06:13.553 --> 06:16.620
You know cortisone wears off
pretty quickly, right?

06:20.560 --> 06:22.552
1664.

06:22.562 --> 06:25.154
What kind of room number is that?

06:25.164 --> 06:27.156
You know, "four" means "death" in China.

06:27.166 --> 06:30.360
1664.
is the number,

06:30.370 --> 06:32.628
which sounds like...

06:32.638 --> 06:34.564
which means "one road to death."

06:34.574 --> 06:36.332
No one can survive in a room like that.

06:36.342 --> 06:39.038
If I walk in there, I'll have
a heart attack on the spot!

06:39.049 --> 06:41.460
Those are just numbers, sir.
I need to get your vitals to...

06:41.471 --> 06:43.840
Oh, don't tell me about numbers.
I run a search engine.

06:43.850 --> 06:46.008
100 server farms and the world's biggest

06:46.018 --> 06:48.177
e-commerce website in the world.

06:48.187 --> 06:51.249
And why are all the rooms
you're offering me facing south?

06:51.260 --> 06:52.749
Health faces north.

06:52.759 --> 06:54.217
A simple research on the Internet

06:54.227 --> 06:57.194
about Chinese customs
would tell you that!

06:58.831 --> 07:00.890
Anne Huntington, the VIP wing.

07:00.900 --> 07:02.759
I need help.

07:02.769 --> 07:05.503
Shall we talk about my ghosts?

07:06.572 --> 07:08.405
Okay.

07:08.918 --> 07:10.643
This is a new one for me.

07:10.943 --> 07:12.368
I'll give it a go.

07:12.378 --> 07:15.371
Do you see them often?

07:15.381 --> 07:16.608
All the time.

07:16.619 --> 07:18.374
What do they look like?

07:18.384 --> 07:19.788
Like you and me.

07:19.799 --> 07:21.344
But dead.

07:21.354 --> 07:22.945
They're my patients.

07:22.955 --> 07:25.214
My neurosurgery patients.

07:25.224 --> 07:28.325
The ones I couldn't save.

07:30.812 --> 07:34.023
Jenny McBride. 13 years old.

07:34.033 --> 07:36.292
Ruptured saccular aneurysm.

07:36.302 --> 07:38.561
Rushed her into surgery
on a Friday night,

07:38.571 --> 07:40.129
but it was too late.

07:40.139 --> 07:42.804
She died on the table.

07:46.045 --> 07:48.104
Bill Hodges. 44.

07:48.114 --> 07:49.705
Married. Two children.

07:49.715 --> 07:52.542
Grade IV anaplastic glioma.

07:52.552 --> 07:55.545
I thought I excised the entire tumor,

07:55.555 --> 07:58.556
but... no.

08:00.393 --> 08:03.486
Dead two months later.

08:03.496 --> 08:06.088
I'd like to run some tests.

08:06.098 --> 08:08.057
Yes. Of course.

08:08.067 --> 08:10.560
Sometimes hallucinations
have a biological basis.

08:10.570 --> 08:12.328
I've considered that possibility.

08:12.338 --> 08:13.663
But you don't think it's the case?

08:13.673 --> 08:15.460
What I think, Conrad,

08:15.471 --> 08:18.439
is that I'm losing my mind.

08:20.836 --> 08:22.863
Hey. I ordered you a scooter.

08:22.874 --> 08:24.957
- Did I ask you for a scooter?
- No.

08:24.968 --> 08:26.472
I can get my own damn scooter.

08:26.483 --> 08:28.952
I've had dementia patients
more rational than you.

08:28.963 --> 08:30.989
Well, you're not my doctor,
so stop trying.

08:31.000 --> 08:32.258
Actually, I am.

08:32.268 --> 08:34.527
I admitted you an hour ago
using your hospital I.D.

08:34.537 --> 08:37.301
You're patient number 421-78A.

08:37.312 --> 08:39.909
High left ankle sprain, under my care.

08:39.921 --> 08:41.467
Ah, you think that's cute?

08:41.760 --> 08:43.251
It's not cute.

08:43.261 --> 08:44.987
You're right. It's not.

08:44.997 --> 08:46.989
- It's my job.
- Okay, enough.

08:46.999 --> 08:49.788
Remember, we want the hospital
to push for an investigation.

08:49.799 --> 08:52.316
There's no more hope for a second
opinion now that Lily's gone,

08:52.327 --> 08:55.898
but an autopsy would prove if Lane
was overdosing her with chemo.

08:55.908 --> 08:57.633
Okay?

08:57.643 --> 08:58.935
Yes. All right.

09:07.823 --> 09:10.413
Dr. Hawkins, Dr. Pravesh, Nurse Nevin,

09:10.423 --> 09:12.415
thank you so much for joining us.

09:12.425 --> 09:15.751
Conrad, I'm so sorry I wasn't there.

09:15.761 --> 09:18.254
I know you tried to save
her life. I can't tell you

09:18.264 --> 09:20.385
how devastated I am.

09:20.396 --> 09:22.620
Lily Kendall's death
was untimely

09:22.631 --> 09:24.893
and unfortunate, and I know
that everyone in this room

09:24.904 --> 09:27.196
is grieving, but it is
important for the hospital

09:27.206 --> 09:28.798
to understand exactly what happened.

09:28.808 --> 09:31.300
Her heart failed.
That much we know for certain.

09:31.310 --> 09:34.337
But she was getting
massive chemotherapy, and...

09:34.347 --> 09:36.038
an autopsy will tell us if that

09:36.048 --> 09:38.341
played a role. We need to make
sure the doses she received

09:38.351 --> 09:39.775
were appropriate.

09:39.785 --> 09:41.878
Of course. I absolutely agree.

09:41.888 --> 09:45.237
An autopsy is 100% warranted.

09:46.158 --> 09:50.019
Great. Then we're
all on the same page.

09:50.029 --> 09:51.921
I'll call Pathology right away.

09:51.931 --> 09:53.389
Claire,

09:53.399 --> 09:56.392
please let me know the minute
you receive the results.

09:56.402 --> 09:58.302
Of course.

10:15.054 --> 10:16.913
Hey, Arthur.

10:16.923 --> 10:19.815
- Randolph. Hey. How are you doing?
- Good.

10:19.825 --> 10:23.753
Listen, I want to talk to you
about my friend with a tremor.

10:23.763 --> 10:26.422
Enough. Let's be honest with each other.

10:26.432 --> 10:29.559
We both know your friend is you.

10:29.569 --> 10:31.561
Look, it happens to the best of us.

10:31.571 --> 10:34.397
We get older, our hand shakes.

10:34.407 --> 10:36.198
I'm on your side.

10:36.208 --> 10:38.932
You've tried a bunch of solutions.

10:38.943 --> 10:41.671
You should consider the possibility
that it might be stress-induced.

10:41.681 --> 10:43.439
Lot of things coming at you at once.

10:43.449 --> 10:45.708
Chief of surgery, face of the hospital.

10:45.718 --> 10:47.209
Not to mention your divorce.

10:47.219 --> 10:49.078
What is it, number four?

10:49.088 --> 10:52.748
Two. Feels like four.

10:52.758 --> 10:54.250
That's a boatload of pressure.

10:54.260 --> 10:56.440
Yeah, well, what do I do, Arthur?

10:56.451 --> 10:58.254
Long term? Jog.

10:58.264 --> 11:00.377
Swim. Learn to meditate.

11:00.388 --> 11:03.559
Figure out a way to blow off
some of that anxiety.

11:03.569 --> 11:05.728
Short term? Take a Xanax.

11:05.738 --> 11:08.431
- It's a benzo. I've tried those.
- Mm. Nah...

11:08.441 --> 11:09.865
This one will take the edge off.

11:09.875 --> 11:11.740
Let you focus on what really matters.

11:11.751 --> 11:13.536
Come up to my office,
I'll give you a sample.

11:13.546 --> 11:14.870
Works wonders.

11:14.880 --> 11:16.772
Check it out.

11:16.782 --> 11:20.417
And I'm paying for two kids in
college and a kitchen remodel.

11:25.891 --> 11:29.151
This is between us, okay?

11:29.161 --> 11:31.128
We look out for our own.

11:44.884 --> 11:47.103
Full results are gonna
take at least a week,

11:47.113 --> 11:50.657
but I might have a preliminary cause
of death in less than 24 hours.

11:50.668 --> 11:53.265
Blood drawn before the code should help.

11:55.621 --> 11:57.588
One question.

12:00.204 --> 12:03.318
Why would Lane agree to this autopsy?

12:13.873 --> 12:15.431
You paged me?

12:15.441 --> 12:16.766
I need you on the VIP wing.

12:16.776 --> 12:18.618
- Are they short-staffed?
- New patient.

12:18.629 --> 12:19.935
Ted Zhou, high security.

12:19.945 --> 12:21.423
Driving the nurses nuts.

12:21.434 --> 12:23.451
I'm a nurse practitioner,
I have my own patients.

12:23.462 --> 12:25.341
The VIP wing's coddling rich people.

12:25.351 --> 12:27.009
That's why I want you up there.

12:27.019 --> 12:28.210
Not a request.

12:28.220 --> 12:29.645
An order.

12:32.665 --> 12:35.117
I want a list of error rates
at every hospital

12:35.127 --> 12:36.886
in the Southeastern United States.

12:36.896 --> 12:39.955
If Chastain Park can't
accommodate what my needs are...

12:39.965 --> 12:42.459
Mr. Zhou, I hear you're nervous
about your surgery.

12:42.470 --> 12:43.506
Who are you?

12:43.517 --> 12:44.967
There were white flowers in my room.

12:44.978 --> 12:46.829
Now, in China,
white flowers for dead people.

12:46.839 --> 12:48.464
Details matter.

12:48.474 --> 12:51.567
Cultural sensitivity is a marker
for overall competence.

12:51.577 --> 12:53.235
Everybody gets anxious in a hospital.

12:53.245 --> 12:54.670
Lack of control, strange place.

12:54.680 --> 12:56.447
I understand, but you're gonna be fine.

12:57.974 --> 12:59.966
I am a nurse, not an assassin.

12:59.977 --> 13:01.986
If you don't trust us,
then you can leave Chastain.

13:01.997 --> 13:04.460
But if you put your hands on me
again, I will have you arrested.

13:04.471 --> 13:06.104
It's okay.

13:09.876 --> 13:12.181
I like your attitude, Ms....?

13:12.192 --> 13:14.184
- Nevin.
- Ah.

13:14.908 --> 13:17.359
What's a lucky number
in China, Mr. Zhou?

13:17.369 --> 13:19.028
In this instance, three.

13:19.038 --> 13:20.571
Three means "life."

13:23.876 --> 13:25.476
Come with me.

13:29.682 --> 13:31.741
- Better?
- Very clever.

13:31.751 --> 13:34.577
Now, if you worked for me,
I'd promote you immediately.

13:34.587 --> 13:36.779
Well, I can't wait
to discuss my new salary,

13:36.789 --> 13:38.380
after your surgery.

13:41.822 --> 13:45.095
I want to see if the hallucinations
are a result of encephalitis.

13:51.493 --> 13:54.196
I'd like to think that having done
a few thousand of these myself

13:54.206 --> 13:56.774
would make it hurt less, but it doesn't.

14:00.479 --> 14:02.057
No whites, no reds?

14:03.149 --> 14:05.115
Everything's normal?

14:20.002 --> 14:22.092
Dr. Bell, do you
still want me to take over?

14:22.103 --> 14:24.927
Yeah, I <i> was</i> gonna supervise the
anastomosis. I think I'll finish up.

14:24.937 --> 14:27.337
2-0 silk.

14:29.011 --> 14:30.132
- Mina.
- I know.

14:30.142 --> 14:32.867
I have Dr. Jacoby's test results.
Tag along if you want to meet her.

14:32.878 --> 14:34.303
I've prepared a speech.

14:34.313 --> 14:38.174
This is too important of a
meeting to forget a single word.

14:38.184 --> 14:41.110
Do you know
why Dr. Jacoby's here?

14:41.120 --> 14:42.721
No.

14:43.289 --> 14:45.355
Let's just say she's not her old self.

14:49.292 --> 14:50.768
Dr. Jacoby.

14:51.664 --> 14:53.122
I'd like to introduce you to someone,

14:53.132 --> 14:55.624
our star surgical resident,
Dr. Mina Okafor.

14:55.634 --> 14:58.961
It is a great honor
to meet you, Dr. Jacoby.

14:58.971 --> 15:01.964
I've followed your career,
starting when I was a child.

15:01.974 --> 15:04.667
I used to read about you
in my uncle's medical journals,

15:04.677 --> 15:06.802
I collected a video library
of your surgeries.

15:06.812 --> 15:10.506
I've played them over and over
to learn your technique.

15:10.516 --> 15:14.710
Your retromastoid and
curvilinear incisions are...

15:14.720 --> 15:16.278
remarkable.

15:16.288 --> 15:17.680
Well, I'm honored.

15:17.690 --> 15:20.123
Thank you.

15:22.843 --> 15:24.486
What are you looking at?

15:24.496 --> 15:28.190
Mrs. Hamilton...
had a spinal cord injury.

15:28.200 --> 15:30.693
Compressed fracture between T7 and T8.

15:30.703 --> 15:32.728
Car accident.

15:32.738 --> 15:36.198
I transgressed the cord
with a titanium screw.

15:36.208 --> 15:37.867
She never walked again.

15:37.877 --> 15:39.668
Your test results... EEG

15:39.678 --> 15:41.904
and spinal tap...
they both came back normal.

15:41.914 --> 15:43.640
So I am losing my mind.

15:43.651 --> 15:46.143
Let's focus on other possible
diagnoses first.

15:46.318 --> 15:48.477
I read in your chart
that you're a vegetarian?

15:48.487 --> 15:49.991
A lifelong vegan.

15:50.002 --> 15:52.481
Vegetarians often suffer
from B12 deficiencies.

15:52.491 --> 15:55.251
A B12 deficiency can cause
people to hallucinate.

15:55.261 --> 15:56.485
In some people; it's rare.

15:56.495 --> 15:58.587
One in 1,000, but it happens,

15:58.597 --> 16:02.258
- so we'll give you...
- High-dose B12 injections.

16:02.268 --> 16:03.858
You really think that will do the trick?

16:03.869 --> 16:06.362
Honestly, I'm not sure, but it's
a quick and easy gamble,

16:06.372 --> 16:07.763
so why not?

16:07.773 --> 16:10.374
I'll take that gamble.

16:14.947 --> 16:17.406
Time to turn that off. No cell
phones in the operating suite.

16:21.186 --> 16:22.778
I was talking to my lawyer.

16:22.788 --> 16:25.214
Making preparations in case I die.

16:25.224 --> 16:27.236
You know, I'm gonna give
all my money away.

16:27.247 --> 16:28.905
I don't want to spoil my children.

16:28.916 --> 16:30.778
They have to learn to
stand on their own.

16:30.789 --> 16:32.620
Well, I'm definitely on board
with your parenting, Mr. Zhou,

16:32.631 --> 16:35.524
but you are not going to die.
At least not here, not today.

16:35.534 --> 16:38.350
So nothing bad ever happens
to patients under your care?

16:38.361 --> 16:39.962
Mr. Zhou.

16:39.972 --> 16:41.305
So nice to see you again.

16:42.374 --> 16:43.699
Are we making you feel welcome?

16:43.709 --> 16:45.567
Dr. Bell. The man on the poster.

16:45.577 --> 16:49.038
Nurse Nevin assures me
I'm in good hands here.

16:49.048 --> 16:50.280
The very best.

17:10.895 --> 17:13.429
Alan Wyatt.

17:14.876 --> 17:16.935
It's a craniotomy

17:17.458 --> 17:19.892
and a facial nerve transection.

17:20.714 --> 17:22.773
It was Mass General,

17:22.893 --> 17:25.800
spring of 1983.

17:26.050 --> 17:28.856
I-I should have cut a little higher.

17:29.020 --> 17:31.306
This is Supervisor Stevens, fifth floor.

17:31.317 --> 17:33.717
I need extension 43.

17:53.443 --> 17:55.458
What the hell's he doing in here?

17:55.469 --> 17:57.595
We thought he might have a gun.

17:57.606 --> 17:58.964
Oh, so you just let him in the OR?

18:00.839 --> 18:03.150
Dr. Butler, can we run through
the checklist, please?

18:03.160 --> 18:05.187
Yes, sir. One, uh,

18:05.198 --> 18:07.054
please confirm the name of the patient.

18:07.064 --> 18:09.961
- Ted Zhou. Male, 55.
- Confirmed.

18:09.972 --> 18:11.629
Two, please confirm the procedure.

18:11.640 --> 18:13.422
Caudate lobectomy.

18:13.433 --> 18:15.109
Confirmed.

18:17.341 --> 18:21.168
See the way she neatly
accesses the superior temporal lobe.

18:21.178 --> 18:23.145
Gives you goose bumps, doesn't it?

18:24.617 --> 18:26.437
Not how I would describe it.

18:26.448 --> 18:27.906
I heard she sees ghosts.

18:27.917 --> 18:30.808
Conrad already found the
biological basis: low B12.

18:30.819 --> 18:32.406
There's no such thing as ghosts.

18:32.417 --> 18:35.648
Not true. I've seen a ghost
right here at Chastain.

18:35.659 --> 18:38.319
Room 1313.

18:38.329 --> 18:40.321
A lot of people died in that room.

18:40.331 --> 18:42.633
- Totally haunted.
- Don't be an idiot.

18:42.644 --> 18:44.959
I read that ghosts were big
in Nigerian culture.

18:44.969 --> 18:46.527
This is America.

18:46.537 --> 18:48.095
The Garuda Purana says

18:48.105 --> 18:50.445
it takes 13 days for the soul
of a dead person

18:50.456 --> 18:52.367
to transition to the eternal.

18:52.378 --> 18:54.534
If the deceased's desires
aren't satisfied,

18:54.545 --> 18:56.219
they get stuck in limbo.

18:56.230 --> 18:59.531
They become Prayt Yonee, a ghost.

19:01.816 --> 19:04.070
I was thinking about Lily...

19:04.822 --> 19:06.989
how she didn't die on her own terms.

19:16.209 --> 19:18.729
Something to say, Dr. Butler?

19:19.470 --> 19:21.378
I'm-I'm sorry. It's just,

19:21.389 --> 19:23.864
it looks like the caudate lobe
is encircling the IVC.

19:23.874 --> 19:26.233
Should we tie off
the small hepatic veins?

19:26.243 --> 19:28.844
In case they bleed
when we excise the tumor.

19:30.066 --> 19:32.725
Not necessary. That's a backup
in case of error.

19:33.391 --> 19:35.016
This is flawless.

19:35.409 --> 19:36.804
Yes, sir.

19:38.574 --> 19:41.234
Where's Dr. Jacoby?

19:41.244 --> 19:43.069
Sent for psych eval.

19:43.401 --> 19:45.505
What? Why?

19:45.515 --> 19:47.481
She was roaming the halls
talking to herself.

19:51.482 --> 19:53.174
So you want me to lie?

19:53.185 --> 19:55.800
They'll keep her
in the psych ward for 72 hours.

19:55.811 --> 19:57.303
She's a frail, old woman.

19:57.314 --> 19:58.831
So, yes, lie.

19:58.842 --> 20:00.868
Just get the point across.

20:00.879 --> 20:03.253
Given your multiple knee
surgeries, you should really...

20:03.264 --> 20:04.558
Did you pull my medical history?

20:04.569 --> 20:06.094
Johnson in Orthopedics has this boot...

20:06.105 --> 20:07.190
No!

20:07.201 --> 20:10.019
Fine, but I won't quit.

20:10.030 --> 20:12.401
She's grossly psychotic.
We're putting her on a hold.

20:12.412 --> 20:16.042
Conrad. MRI results.
Brain bleed in her frontal lobe.

20:16.808 --> 20:18.940
Well, that could explain
her hallucinations.

20:18.951 --> 20:20.176
She needs surgery.

20:20.187 --> 20:21.945
ASAP.

20:21.956 --> 20:23.614
I have a brain bleed?

20:23.982 --> 20:26.173
I had to tell 'em something.

20:26.184 --> 20:28.167
The B12 shots didn't do a damn thing.

20:28.178 --> 20:29.636
You have not changed.

20:29.647 --> 20:31.003
Not at all.

20:31.014 --> 20:32.589
Sometimes we wish he would.

20:33.225 --> 20:34.729
Who is this handsome young man?

20:34.740 --> 20:36.265
Devon Pravesh, Dr. Jacoby.

20:36.276 --> 20:38.745
- I've heard a lot about you.
- All scandals, I hope.

20:38.756 --> 20:42.350
Ah, lurid but very enjoyable.

20:43.135 --> 20:45.058
We need to consider
a different diagnosis.

20:45.069 --> 20:47.695
Another test, huh?
A PET scan or MRI?

20:47.706 --> 20:49.565
No, no more tests.

20:49.576 --> 20:52.377
You and I need to discuss
what's really going on.

20:53.792 --> 20:55.167
How you feeling, Mr. Zhou?

20:55.178 --> 20:56.698
Can you hear me?

20:57.464 --> 20:58.878
Dr. Bell's surgery went well?

20:58.889 --> 21:02.649
Well... the patient survived.

21:02.660 --> 21:05.219
Am I missing something? Were you
expecting a different outcome?

21:05.230 --> 21:07.407
Mr. Zhou, can you look over here?

21:11.658 --> 21:12.724
Get back.

21:13.003 --> 21:15.995
- Hey, out!
- BP 70/30.

21:16.006 --> 21:18.073
- I need two units of PRBCs.
- Cycling again.

21:18.739 --> 21:21.284
- His pulse is getting weak.
- Systolic is down to 50.

21:21.295 --> 21:23.067
Can someone tell me
what's happening, please?

21:23.078 --> 21:25.427
Page Dr. Okafor and Dr. Silva.
Patient needs the OR, stat.

21:25.438 --> 21:27.841
Why Silva and Okafor?
That's Dr. Bell's patient.

21:27.852 --> 21:30.271
He's bleeding internally. My
guess is it's Dr. Bell's fault.

21:30.282 --> 21:32.114
Now, you can let him try to fix it,

21:32.125 --> 21:34.132
or would you prefer Mr. Zhou lives?

21:40.521 --> 21:43.180
Ladies and gentlemen,
if I could have your attention.

21:43.191 --> 21:44.583
I'm Dr. Randolph Bell,

21:44.594 --> 21:46.252
Mr. Zhou's surgeon.

21:46.263 --> 21:48.732
We completed the operation at about 2:50.

21:58.325 --> 22:00.074
Blood pooling behind the IVC.

22:00.084 --> 22:03.244
Yeah. Clamps for me and Dr. Okafor.

22:03.254 --> 22:05.713
No one tied off the hepatic veins.

22:05.723 --> 22:07.505
Who removes the caudate without...?

22:07.516 --> 22:09.505
Dr. Bell said it was a waste of time.

22:10.677 --> 22:13.821
He should've known better.
In over his head as usual.

22:13.831 --> 22:16.317
Okay, infrahepatic clamp's in place.

22:16.328 --> 22:17.992
- Suturing now?
- What's going on?

22:18.002 --> 22:19.293
Hey, how many people have to die

22:19.303 --> 22:20.795
before you turn in your scrubs, huh?

22:20.805 --> 22:22.442
It doesn't matter how great you were,

22:22.453 --> 22:24.239
it's how great you are, here and now.

22:24.250 --> 22:26.742
You don't have it anymore.
It's time to retire.

22:27.325 --> 22:29.804
How dare you? You question my ability?

22:29.814 --> 22:31.605
Not in my OR. Not in my hospital.

22:31.615 --> 22:34.786
I see incompetence,
I call it out. End of story.

22:34.797 --> 22:37.474
- And this isn't your hospital.
- I've operated on more patients...

22:37.485 --> 22:39.080
You didn't tie off the hepatic veins.

22:39.090 --> 22:40.880
You caused a tear in the IVC.

22:40.891 --> 22:43.073
Now, a second-year resident
doesn't make that mistake,

22:43.084 --> 22:44.383
but you did.

22:53.938 --> 22:56.695
Ted Zhou is my patient.

22:58.179 --> 23:01.310
No. Not anymore he's not.

23:07.518 --> 23:09.610
- I wanted you to see this place.
- Mm-hmm.

23:09.620 --> 23:11.412
Have a simple conversation.

23:11.422 --> 23:15.883
- I know it would do me some good.
- Fine. About what?

23:15.893 --> 23:17.359
Ghosts.

23:18.496 --> 23:20.488
You think the ones you see are real?

23:20.498 --> 23:23.891
Oh, now that's a complicated question.

23:23.901 --> 23:25.945
They...

23:26.130 --> 23:29.724
They're as real
as human regret or guilt.

23:30.140 --> 23:32.932
I keep thinking they want something.

23:32.943 --> 23:34.702
Are they angry?

23:34.712 --> 23:37.398
Or do they blame me?

23:37.409 --> 23:40.836
Sadly, they can't speak.

23:41.185 --> 23:46.013
So what I want most of all
is to undo the mistakes.

23:46.968 --> 23:48.957
And I can't.

23:55.218 --> 23:57.024
Dr. Jacoby.

23:57.537 --> 24:01.019
Depression is a very powerful
illness, we both know that.

24:01.038 --> 24:02.976
Would you consider the possibility

24:02.987 --> 24:05.366
that depression with psychotic
effect could lead to...

24:05.376 --> 24:06.843
Hallucinations. Yeah.

24:06.854 --> 24:08.148
Yes.

24:09.280 --> 24:11.172
Well, I have good reason
to be depressed.

24:11.182 --> 24:13.820
My career is over, my best years
are behind me, and...

24:13.831 --> 24:15.475
You've had a wonderful career.

24:15.486 --> 24:18.875
Broken down barriers.
Trained so many great doctors.

24:20.601 --> 24:22.950
You are an inspiration.

24:22.960 --> 24:27.621
- And you saved so many lives.
- But I lost so many as well.

24:27.631 --> 24:30.457
I carry around a small cemetery
in my brain.

24:30.467 --> 24:34.061
You took on the riskiest cases
and had so many triumphs.

24:34.071 --> 24:35.896
Yeah, well, joy leaves too quickly

24:35.906 --> 24:37.328
and sorrow rudely overstays.

24:37.339 --> 24:40.757
Over the course of 40 years, not
every outcome is gonna be perfect.

24:40.768 --> 24:42.627
The only thing any of us can hope for

24:42.638 --> 24:45.071
is the good we do
far outweighs the harm.

24:54.658 --> 24:58.360
No amount of talk is going
to change the past, Conrad.

25:00.024 --> 25:02.864
There are some memories
you can't escape.

25:13.110 --> 25:16.245
He's still Chief of Surgery.
He could have you fired.

25:20.484 --> 25:21.642
Dr. Bell,

25:21.652 --> 25:23.911
I, uh...

25:23.921 --> 25:25.312
I lost my temper earlier.

25:25.322 --> 25:29.750
Heat of the moment. We could use a hand.

25:29.760 --> 25:33.120
Maybe you can run the patient's bowel.

25:33.130 --> 25:36.257
Hey, Dr. Silva, you don't invite
me back into my own surgery.

25:36.267 --> 25:38.025
I'll make that call.

25:38.035 --> 25:40.127
But you're right, you do need help.

25:40.137 --> 25:41.528
You crossed a line.

25:41.538 --> 25:43.764
Duly noted.

25:43.774 --> 25:46.174
Step aside.

26:01.892 --> 26:05.032
There's an obstructive mass.

26:06.930 --> 26:09.998
We'll have to resect it
and look for other metastasis.

26:11.568 --> 26:14.036
I'll save his life.

26:50.377 --> 26:51.910
Dr. Silva.

26:54.846 --> 26:58.420
Another tour of duty
or another hospital.

26:58.430 --> 27:00.572
That's your future.

27:01.033 --> 27:04.835
The board will be revoking
your privileges at Chastain.

27:10.276 --> 27:13.076
What was that all about?

27:14.513 --> 27:16.872
You know, in 1980
the Shah of Iran was sick.

27:17.963 --> 27:20.056
Had to have his spleen removed.

27:20.953 --> 27:23.212
They brought in the most famous
doctor in the world,

27:23.222 --> 27:24.900
Michael DeBakey.

27:24.911 --> 27:26.949
Now, DeBakey was a heart surgeon.

27:26.959 --> 27:30.185
You know, he'd only done a handful
of splenectomies his entire career.

27:30.195 --> 27:33.022
But operating on the Shah, well,

27:33.032 --> 27:35.824
that was an honor
he just couldn't resist.

27:35.834 --> 27:38.127
He botched the operation,

27:38.137 --> 27:41.204
and ten days later, the Shah
died from complications.

27:42.841 --> 27:46.135
DeBakey never once admitted his mistake.

27:46.145 --> 27:48.704
That was 40 years ago,

27:48.714 --> 27:50.714
and nothing's changed.

27:59.258 --> 28:00.991
Mina, I need your help.

28:06.432 --> 28:10.426
You tried your best, and I
appreciate it, but enough is enough.

28:10.436 --> 28:12.695
Dr. Okafor has a favor to ask
before you go.

28:12.705 --> 28:17.525
There is an operating microscope in
OR Three that I cannot rebalance.

28:17.536 --> 28:20.336
I've tried a dozen times.
They were your specialty.

28:20.346 --> 28:23.205
I was wondering if you might help me.

28:23.215 --> 28:26.275
Oh. Well, I suppose I have the time.

28:26.285 --> 28:28.775
Not like they're knocking
my door down to do a TED Talk.

28:28.786 --> 28:30.953
Shall we?

28:43.902 --> 28:45.244
Really?

28:45.938 --> 28:48.197
So the way I see it,
you have two options.

28:48.207 --> 28:50.933
One, you continue to hobble
around here like an ass.

28:50.943 --> 28:54.103
Eventually you'll completely tear
your ligament and require surgery.

28:54.113 --> 28:56.847
Or two, you pick one of these.

29:00.419 --> 29:01.527
Conrad.

29:03.504 --> 29:06.615
You didn't listen to Nic about Lane.

29:06.625 --> 29:08.543
I believed her.

29:08.554 --> 29:10.268
You didn't.

29:10.279 --> 29:13.139
I saved Lily once. You lost her.

29:13.150 --> 29:16.043
But you get to be the only one
around here in pain?

29:18.598 --> 29:22.072
Don't malign me as a doctor, keeping
me from treating your foot.

29:23.676 --> 29:27.244
For Lily, I was a better doctor
than you were.

29:32.308 --> 29:36.262
It's been weeks since anyone's
been able to use it.

29:36.676 --> 29:40.754
I tried to rebalance, but the
stabilizer arm won't sit still.

29:43.829 --> 29:45.354
Ooh.

29:45.364 --> 29:47.122
- That's not good.
- Yeah.

29:47.132 --> 29:50.667
Perhaps you could give it a try?

29:53.806 --> 29:57.199
It's been quite a while.
I'm not sure I remember how.

29:57.209 --> 29:59.743
Well, what harm could it do, huh?

30:02.973 --> 30:06.567
Okay. No...

30:06.578 --> 30:09.378
- Was it me? Not the machine?
- No, the counterbalance is off.

30:10.522 --> 30:15.358
We have to raise the arm like so.

30:16.144 --> 30:17.744
And...

30:22.559 --> 30:24.959
And then refocus the optics.

30:24.970 --> 30:26.462
There.

30:26.472 --> 30:28.731
That should help.

30:28.741 --> 30:30.607
There.

30:32.311 --> 30:33.969
Poetry.

30:33.979 --> 30:36.472
Oh, my.

30:36.482 --> 30:38.574
Strange how good this feels.

30:39.293 --> 30:42.511
I always used to be terrified
at the start of an operation.

30:42.521 --> 30:47.249
You know, in neurosurgery
the margin of error is so slim.

30:47.259 --> 30:51.086
But as soon as I felt
these controls in my hands,

30:51.096 --> 30:53.956
the fear would just disappear.

30:55.734 --> 30:57.168
I'm sorry.

30:57.179 --> 31:00.194
I'm a silly old woman getting
emotional over a machine.

31:01.492 --> 31:04.504
I am very emotional about machines.

31:04.943 --> 31:08.160
People, not so much.

31:08.792 --> 31:09.983
Thank you.

31:09.994 --> 31:13.020
Oh. Oh, my dear. Fixing it was nothing.

31:13.418 --> 31:17.087
No. For being my hero.

31:36.807 --> 31:40.208
Mr. Zhou, you came through
the surgery with flying colors.

31:42.959 --> 31:45.693
But there was a complication.

31:46.416 --> 31:48.777
During the course of removing the tumor

31:48.787 --> 31:51.580
- from your liver...
- Is there something wrong?

31:53.143 --> 31:56.084
I found a single metastatic mass

31:56.094 --> 31:59.087
in your intestine causing
an obstruction, which I removed,

31:59.097 --> 32:00.400
all of it.

32:00.411 --> 32:02.314
Now, we're still waiting
on the pathology,

32:02.325 --> 32:04.117
but you should be in the clear.

32:04.128 --> 32:06.877
You truly are a great surgeon, Dr. Bell.

32:12.579 --> 32:14.900
A small token of my appreciation.

32:21.954 --> 32:23.512
Is this...?

32:23.522 --> 32:25.947
It's real, of course.

32:25.958 --> 32:27.830
24 karats.

32:27.841 --> 32:30.182
I would be insulted
if you didn't accept it.

32:30.193 --> 32:32.661
Well, if you insist, I...

32:40.539 --> 32:43.765
I'd like to stay for a moment
if that's all right.

32:43.775 --> 32:45.767
Of course... but I have surgery.

32:45.777 --> 32:47.636
I'll close up the room,

32:47.646 --> 32:49.938
and I'll make sure
the lights are off, I promise.

32:49.948 --> 32:51.506
Okay.

32:51.516 --> 32:53.016
Thanks.

33:05.797 --> 33:08.365
I'm sorry.

33:17.346 --> 33:19.142
I did my best.

33:38.174 --> 33:40.298
How's the patient?

33:40.308 --> 33:42.441
Resting peacefully, thanks to you.

33:44.486 --> 33:49.173
So, I kind of got into a bit of a thing

33:49.183 --> 33:50.549
with Bell in the OR earlier.

33:50.560 --> 33:53.176
I know. It's all anyone's talking about.

33:53.187 --> 33:55.913
Hmm. I'm done at this hospital.

33:55.923 --> 33:57.814
Jude, you're one of the best.

33:57.825 --> 33:59.814
- You'll survive.
- No, not this time.

33:59.825 --> 34:02.604
No, the bridge is burned... for good.

34:03.424 --> 34:05.971
I just wanted to tell you, um,

34:07.034 --> 34:08.734
how sorry I am about Lily.

34:11.239 --> 34:13.205
Thank you.

34:15.342 --> 34:17.768
I'll see you around, Nic.

34:17.777 --> 34:20.045
See you around, Jude.

34:29.020 --> 34:32.090
You really need to get
that looked at, Conrad.

34:33.060 --> 34:35.353
Spoke to our head of psychiatry.

34:35.362 --> 34:39.724
She offered to start seeing you
herself next week.

34:39.734 --> 34:41.960
Depression needs to be fought head-on.

34:41.971 --> 34:44.462
The world needs more doctors like you.

34:44.472 --> 34:47.898
Which is why I've decided
to go back to teaching.

34:47.908 --> 34:50.139
That sounds like a perfect way
to let go of the past.

34:50.150 --> 34:52.036
Live forward with purpose.

34:52.045 --> 34:55.080
And forgive ourselves.

34:58.319 --> 35:00.811
You lost someone as well, hmm?

35:01.686 --> 35:03.188
Recently?

35:05.984 --> 35:09.028
Then you need to live forward, too.

35:26.049 --> 35:27.574
Come in.

35:27.982 --> 35:29.273
Hey.

35:29.283 --> 35:32.943
So, I, uh, heard you had a bad day.

35:34.470 --> 35:38.031
Listen, you saved a man's life today.

35:38.526 --> 35:40.918
You're an incredible surgeon, Randolph.

35:40.928 --> 35:42.358
People are jealous.

35:42.369 --> 35:44.202
The higher we rise in this world,

35:44.213 --> 35:47.053
the more the little people want
to bring us down.

35:48.169 --> 35:51.529
But you, my friend, you can fight it.

35:51.539 --> 35:54.440
I have, believe me.

35:57.845 --> 36:01.272
I'm gonna get ten grand
for this... maybe.

36:01.282 --> 36:03.930
You don't need the money,
a man like you.

36:03.941 --> 36:06.453
I sunk two million bucks
into a motel in Conyers,

36:06.464 --> 36:10.046
a million and a half on the
Bell Tool, and the divorce...

36:10.057 --> 36:13.551
That was...

36:13.561 --> 36:16.020
the most recent blow.

36:16.030 --> 36:20.358
Oh, I'm good at a lot of
things. Money isn't one of them.

36:20.368 --> 36:23.661
Unbelievable... after all the billing

36:23.671 --> 36:25.663
you generate for Chastain every year.

36:25.673 --> 36:28.235
- None of it in my pocket.
- You know where it ends up.

36:28.246 --> 36:30.138
In the pocket of our CEO.

36:30.149 --> 36:32.635
Claire Thorpe makes $3 million a year.

36:32.646 --> 36:34.836
Yeah. She's not even a doctor.

36:34.847 --> 36:37.073
She's a complete incompetent
if you ask me.

36:37.084 --> 36:39.743
I mean, all that nonsense
about transparency.

36:39.754 --> 36:41.345
Exposes us to lawsuits,

36:41.355 --> 36:44.375
forces us
to practice defensive medicine.

36:44.386 --> 36:46.684
You know,
she's destroying this hospital.

36:46.694 --> 36:50.054
We need to have a physician
running Chastain,

36:50.064 --> 36:51.719
not an MBA.

36:51.730 --> 36:54.156
I mean, you could do the job, Randolph.

36:54.167 --> 36:55.992
You'd be great at it.

36:56.003 --> 36:58.829
I mean, not that you'd want
to do it, of course.

37:02.206 --> 37:03.772
Let's have that drink.

37:13.570 --> 37:14.953
Cheers.

37:21.388 --> 37:23.141
What?

37:25.555 --> 37:27.020
What are you thinking?

37:27.101 --> 37:29.835
Nothing.

37:42.316 --> 37:44.141
Really
getting into this, huh?

37:44.151 --> 37:46.635
- Yeah.
- Yeah, it's a good look on you.

37:46.646 --> 37:48.611
You and Bell kiss and make up?

37:48.622 --> 37:51.949
Yeah. You ever checked out
Doctors Without Borders?

37:51.959 --> 37:54.819
They send you to hot spots
all over the globe.

37:54.829 --> 37:56.387
Yeah, I know about 'em.

37:56.397 --> 37:57.760
What are you talking about?

37:57.771 --> 37:59.696
Saving lives
while people shoot at you...

37:59.707 --> 38:01.900
it's kind of my speed.

38:02.470 --> 38:04.728
They're doing real good in the world.

38:04.738 --> 38:08.073
Jude, I'll walk
into Bell's office right now...

38:08.084 --> 38:09.708
No, no, no, no.

38:10.110 --> 38:12.659
I stayed at Chastain
for the wrong reasons.

38:12.670 --> 38:16.807
And I should have gone with my gut
a long time ago and moved on.

38:17.807 --> 38:19.503
That's the truth.

38:19.514 --> 38:21.681
We both know it.

38:25.426 --> 38:28.827
You said... Nic deserves me.

38:29.870 --> 38:31.643
You said I can give her what you can't.

38:31.654 --> 38:33.913
Yeah, and?

38:34.602 --> 38:36.151
Lily's death.

38:37.151 --> 38:38.846
She's hurting pretty bad.

38:38.857 --> 38:41.616
You see, I want to help her,
but I can't.

38:41.627 --> 38:44.174
I'm not the guy that's gonna
make it better for her.

38:47.802 --> 38:49.902
Only you can do that.

38:52.963 --> 38:54.286
Hey.

38:58.229 --> 38:59.643
Stay safe.

39:00.034 --> 39:01.823
Brother.

39:26.365 --> 39:27.886
Nic.

39:34.462 --> 39:36.329
You never got X-rays, did you?

39:39.068 --> 39:41.498
I'm not here
to talk about my ankle.

39:41.509 --> 39:43.568
Your ankle's getting worse.

39:44.631 --> 39:46.764
Honestly, it's killing me.

39:54.849 --> 39:56.707
Come on, I'll drive you.

39:56.717 --> 40:00.085
Take you three days to get home
on that stupid scooter.

40:07.761 --> 40:10.220
<i>Been a while since I've been here.</i>

40:10.230 --> 40:12.389
<i>The stairs were fun.</i>

40:12.399 --> 40:15.426
Well, we made it. Go sit down.

40:18.038 --> 40:20.365
Ice packs in...

40:20.975 --> 40:23.482
First aid kit's still on top of the...

40:23.967 --> 40:26.232
Right, you know.

40:40.587 --> 40:42.693
Give me your foot.

40:44.428 --> 40:46.996
I'm not a doctor.
I'm not gonna hurt you.

40:52.162 --> 40:53.756
Oh, my God.

40:59.576 --> 41:01.905
You know, if you would have
let me do this this morning,

41:01.915 --> 41:03.474
it wouldn't have gotten so bad.

41:03.484 --> 41:06.251
But things are never
that simple with you, are they?

41:10.724 --> 41:12.451
Nic?

41:14.724 --> 41:16.537
I should have listened to you sooner,

41:16.548 --> 41:19.783
believed what you said
about Lane, but I just...

41:22.615 --> 41:24.169
I didn't.

41:26.807 --> 41:28.310
Keep it elevated,

41:28.849 --> 41:30.634
ice it every hour,

41:30.644 --> 41:33.203
take an anti-inflammatory.
You know the drill.

41:33.213 --> 41:35.673
Please.

41:35.683 --> 41:38.542
I don't want to do this.

41:40.721 --> 41:42.224
I just... I can't.

41:44.792 --> 41:46.850
What do you want me to say?

41:46.860 --> 41:48.514
Nothing.

41:50.683 --> 41:52.341
Because it's not your fault.

41:53.357 --> 41:55.534
It's mine.

41:58.789 --> 42:01.748
And Lily's gone.

42:04.011 --> 42:06.053
It's killing me.

42:06.064 --> 42:09.332
But that is no excuse
not to see your pain.

42:13.520 --> 42:17.314
I'm sorry... for everything.
