WEBVTT

00:01.469 --> 00:03.071
NARRATOR: All righty, friends.
We left Jane and Rafael

00:03.104 --> 00:04.138
dating in secret.
But they decided

00:04.172 --> 00:06.207
it was time to come out
of the closet.

00:06.240 --> 00:09.110
We should tell our family
that we're together.

00:09.143 --> 00:12.346
Not going as well?
Jane's writing.

00:12.380 --> 00:14.348
See, she had gotten
a bad book review,

00:14.382 --> 00:16.717
and ever since,
she had been totally lost.

00:16.750 --> 00:18.752
My career is nowhere.
I don't have an agent,

00:18.786 --> 00:20.421
a publisher, an idea.

00:20.454 --> 00:23.057
Also lost?
Rafael's real parents.

00:23.091 --> 00:25.459
Actually, buddy,
I don't know who they are.

00:25.493 --> 00:27.361
And, of course,
Jane had an opinion.

00:27.395 --> 00:30.164
I think you should look
for your birth parents.

00:30.198 --> 00:31.565
I know. What a mystery.

00:31.599 --> 00:33.567
Which reminds me,
Petra's lawyer J.R.

00:35.736 --> 00:38.572
to make sure Petra
went to jail. Only then,

00:38.606 --> 00:41.642
she had a change of heart,
so she told Petra everything.

00:41.675 --> 00:43.311
You planted the screws.

00:43.344 --> 00:45.313
No. It must have
been the blackmailer.

00:45.346 --> 00:47.848
Your mother.
I can only assume.

00:47.881 --> 00:50.084
And then she promised Petra
she'd help her.

00:50.118 --> 00:51.719
Oh, and complicating that--

00:51.752 --> 00:52.920
Petra's sexy dream.

00:52.953 --> 00:55.723
So, yeah, straight out
of a telenovela, right?

00:55.756 --> 00:58.592
Well, imagine this. Jane's
father was trying to bring

00:58.626 --> 00:59.793
The Passions of Santos
to America,

00:59.827 --> 01:02.263
but he was having trouble
casting a costar,

01:02.296 --> 01:05.099
which had left him a little
distracted from his new wife.

01:05.133 --> 01:06.567
I'm just trying
to figure out my life,

01:06.600 --> 01:09.437
which you would have noticed
if you paid attention.

01:09.470 --> 01:11.372
And Xiomara? Well,

01:11.405 --> 01:13.407
she said she was going
to teach a dance class

01:13.441 --> 01:15.143
and then ended up here.

01:15.176 --> 01:16.844
I know. OMG, right?

01:16.877 --> 01:18.812
So let's see what happens next.

01:19.880 --> 01:22.383
It is a truth universally known

01:22.416 --> 01:24.118
that everyone's a critic.

01:24.152 --> 01:25.486
I don't like
that pillow.

01:25.519 --> 01:27.188
Especially Jane.

01:27.221 --> 01:28.856
It never existed.

01:28.889 --> 01:30.624
So?
It's perfect.

01:30.658 --> 01:31.825
My family's gonna freak.

01:31.859 --> 01:33.594
Oh, they're gonna lose
their minds.

01:33.627 --> 01:36.197
I mean, Rafael's apartment
looks good, but...

01:36.230 --> 01:38.166
it's not exactly HGTV-worthy.

01:38.199 --> 01:39.900
My abuela' head
might actually explode.

01:39.933 --> 01:42.570
Well, it is a nice picture,
but I don't know

01:42.603 --> 01:44.705
if it's a head exploder.

01:44.738 --> 01:46.340
Perfect.

01:46.374 --> 01:49.343
I was thinking that that
could be your nightstand.

01:49.377 --> 01:51.212
For when you stay over.

01:52.746 --> 01:55.516
I don't know
how my dad's gonna feel.

01:55.549 --> 01:57.218
And my mom is
the real wild card.

01:57.251 --> 01:58.852
She could go either way.

01:58.886 --> 02:00.688
No way. Deep down,

02:00.721 --> 02:02.690
I think she's always wanted us
to be together.

02:02.723 --> 02:04.525
Oh! Doi!

02:04.558 --> 02:06.560
They're talking about telling
everyone they're dating.

02:06.594 --> 02:08.262
Someone's definitely gonna cry.

02:08.296 --> 02:10.398
Yeah. You.

02:10.431 --> 02:12.366
Well, what are we waiting for?

02:12.400 --> 02:14.302
Let's see those huge reactions!

02:14.335 --> 02:16.670
We have news.

02:16.704 --> 02:18.306
We're dating!
We're dating!

02:21.842 --> 02:23.444
Ugh, Ma,

02:23.477 --> 02:24.545
it's not fair! Just because

02:24.578 --> 02:25.946
it was today,
of all days!

02:25.979 --> 02:27.281
That's only because

02:27.315 --> 02:28.682
you got to pick your
day first, Alba.

02:28.716 --> 02:30.251
Fine, here. Take it.
JANE: Uh, hold on.

02:30.284 --> 02:31.151
What is going on?

02:31.185 --> 02:32.420
She won the bet--
when you'd tell us.

02:32.453 --> 02:33.721
You guys knew?

02:35.456 --> 02:36.424
You were pretty obvious.

02:36.457 --> 02:37.725
The whole "pulled muscle" thing?

02:37.758 --> 02:39.727
Rafael was just, uh,
helping me with,

02:39.760 --> 02:41.495
uh, my, um...
Drawers.

02:42.896 --> 02:45.333
I know a sex injury
when I see one.

02:45.366 --> 02:47.435
Yeah, you do.

02:59.580 --> 03:02.216
Seriously?
Everybody knew?

03:05.786 --> 03:07.221
I can't believe this!

03:07.255 --> 03:08.622
My heart feels like-like...

03:08.656 --> 03:10.258
It's glowing?
Yeah!

03:10.291 --> 03:12.493
Exactly! Like it's glowing!

03:14.362 --> 03:17.197
Called it.

03:18.832 --> 03:20.834
*

03:32.580 --> 03:34.348
Okay. Well, we have
to be careful here.

03:34.382 --> 03:35.949
Petra can be...
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Bitchy.

03:35.983 --> 03:38.352
Tricky. I felt very
much on the outside

03:38.386 --> 03:41.589
when you guys were dating, so
I just want to be sensitive.

03:44.925 --> 03:45.859
You look surprised.

03:45.893 --> 03:47.861
Shocked, actually.

03:47.895 --> 03:49.930
This is why you called
an important family meeting

03:49.963 --> 03:51.332
in the middle of the day?

03:51.365 --> 03:53.501
To tell me
you're dating?

03:53.534 --> 03:55.035
What-what is this,
sophomore year of high school?

03:55.068 --> 03:57.405
What, did he ask you to prom?
Are you aware that I am

03:57.438 --> 03:59.773
currently under investigation
for murder?!

03:59.807 --> 04:01.675
We were just trying
to be mindful of our history.
We-we really weren't thinking.

04:01.709 --> 04:03.577
Look, we're really sorry.
You're together.
Whoop-de-freaking-do.

04:03.611 --> 04:05.379
What did you want, fireworks?

04:06.380 --> 04:07.881
No. Of course not.

04:07.915 --> 04:09.683
Okay. Now, if
you'll excuse me,

04:09.717 --> 04:12.820
I have an important meeting with
my criminal defense attorney

04:12.853 --> 04:14.888
to discuss strategies
to keep me out of prison.

04:16.990 --> 04:19.693
But many happy returns
to the new couple.

04:24.365 --> 04:25.733
Anything?

04:25.766 --> 04:27.034
It's been two days!

04:27.067 --> 04:28.569
How have we not heard from them?

04:28.602 --> 04:30.003
Petra, calm down.
You calm down!

04:30.037 --> 04:31.972
Someone's trying to frame me
for murder!

04:32.005 --> 04:33.507
And I'm working on it.

04:33.541 --> 04:35.343
By doing what? And do not say

04:35.376 --> 04:36.644
"waiting."
Waiting.

04:36.677 --> 04:39.012
Maybe it's you. Maybe you're
still working with them.

04:39.046 --> 04:40.748
I'm not.
You could be!
I mean, you were.

04:40.781 --> 04:41.749
And what do I really
know about you?
Petra,

04:41.782 --> 04:43.751
stop.

04:46.954 --> 04:49.390
Breathe.

04:49.423 --> 04:51.925
We're in this
together, okay?

04:51.959 --> 04:54.328
I'm not working for anyone else.

04:54.362 --> 04:55.996
If you go down,

04:56.029 --> 04:57.565
I go down.

05:00.834 --> 05:03.404
Now, did you
make the list?

05:03.437 --> 05:04.772
Yes.

05:06.740 --> 05:08.075
This is everyone
I could think of

05:08.108 --> 05:10.310
who might want
to see me behind bars.

05:11.879 --> 05:14.448
*

05:18.519 --> 05:20.688
Pammy the Parrot?

05:20.721 --> 05:22.890
Well, the guy who plays
the parrot at the Marbella.

05:22.923 --> 05:24.592
I'm often quite short with him.

05:24.625 --> 05:25.593
What's his name?

05:25.626 --> 05:26.594
I don't know his name.

05:26.627 --> 05:28.095
I call him Parrot Guy.

05:28.128 --> 05:32.433
That's also why
he's on the list.

05:32.466 --> 05:34.101
Okay.

05:34.134 --> 05:35.903
I'll check out Parrot Guy.

05:35.936 --> 05:38.972
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Ah, what a seamless transition.

05:39.006 --> 05:40.140
Go write.

05:40.173 --> 05:41.609
I'll see you later.

05:41.642 --> 05:44.144
And if anything comes
from Italy...?

05:44.177 --> 05:45.746
To remind you,
Rafael was searching

05:45.779 --> 05:47.147
for his biological mother.

05:47.180 --> 05:49.617
I will wait to open it with you.
Well, maybe not

05:49.650 --> 05:51.452
remind you
so much as tell you--

05:51.485 --> 05:52.486
he decided to look for her.

05:52.520 --> 05:53.721
You nervous?

05:53.754 --> 05:55.989
Because if you want
to talk or anything,

05:56.023 --> 05:58.025
I can stay and
we can take a walk.

05:58.058 --> 05:59.393
I know what you're doing.

05:59.427 --> 06:01.862
I am not trying
to avoid writing!
You're trying to avoid writing.

06:01.895 --> 06:04.064
Okay, a little. But
that's because there's nothing

06:04.097 --> 06:05.098
to write about!

06:06.734 --> 06:08.869
Then sit in front of the
computer and stare at it.

06:08.902 --> 06:11.138
Go.

06:11.171 --> 06:14.508
Ooh! Looks like Jane's
actually making progress.

06:16.644 --> 06:17.978
Oh!

06:20.113 --> 06:21.982
Aw, thank you.

06:22.983 --> 06:24.552
No, not yet.

06:24.585 --> 06:25.819
Mm...

06:27.588 --> 06:29.923
Hmm?

06:32.059 --> 06:35.028
If you must know...

06:35.062 --> 06:38.966
I'm writing a response to the
critic who gave me a bad review.

06:40.768 --> 06:42.069
I was.

06:42.102 --> 06:44.438
But then I went
on my book page on Amazon--

06:44.472 --> 06:46.039
you know,
to bolster my confidence,

06:46.073 --> 06:48.576
remind myself that I'm
a published freaking author--

06:48.609 --> 06:50.177
and they linked that review.

06:50.210 --> 06:52.846
So the first thing anyone sees
when they go to buy my book

06:52.880 --> 06:54.582
is a reason to not buy my book.

06:54.615 --> 06:56.183
Ay, mi amor.
And I reread it.

06:56.216 --> 06:59.620
And, honestly, this guy just
didn't get what I was doing.

06:59.653 --> 07:03.190
He said that the main character
was cringeworthy at times.

07:03.223 --> 07:04.958
What

07:04.992 --> 07:06.660
But that's the point.

07:06.694 --> 07:10.063
People aren't perfect.
Ever heard of Walt Whitman, sir?

07:10.097 --> 07:13.534
"Do I contradict myself? Very
well then I contradict myself,

07:13.567 --> 07:16.537
I am large,
I contain multitudes"!

07:17.671 --> 07:19.673
I certainly did.
And I called him out

07:19.707 --> 07:20.908
on his cultural bias.

07:20.941 --> 07:22.943
I mean,
too much magical realism?

07:22.976 --> 07:24.945
I hate this guy.
Maybe he's

07:24.978 --> 07:26.213
never heard of a little author

07:26.246 --> 07:27.314
by the name
of Gabriel García Márquez.

07:27.347 --> 07:30.217
Márquez says magical realism
runs through our streets.

07:30.250 --> 07:31.719
Right?

07:31.752 --> 07:35.255
See, this guy read it all wrong.

07:35.288 --> 07:37.558
I mean, he says "derivative"--

07:37.591 --> 07:38.792
I say "homage."

07:38.826 --> 07:40.794
And maybe it "fell flat" to him,

07:40.828 --> 07:43.897
but maybe it's just
his warped white male lens.

07:45.165 --> 07:46.600
Mm!

07:50.003 --> 07:51.672
I know, I know.

07:51.705 --> 07:53.674
That would be "over the top."

07:53.707 --> 07:54.975
Which I'm not.

07:57.978 --> 08:00.581
I know. You're right.

08:00.614 --> 08:03.116
I need to move forward.

08:03.150 --> 08:04.852
*

08:06.687 --> 08:08.889
ROGELIO: I told her
I just want to move forward.

08:08.922 --> 08:10.691
Actually, I told her doorman,

08:10.724 --> 08:12.993
because River will not see
or speak to me.

08:13.026 --> 08:14.662
It was ridiculous.

08:14.695 --> 08:16.396
I mean, obviously,
we got off on the wrong foot.

08:16.429 --> 08:19.299
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
I'll remind you why
that wording is in poor taste.

08:19.332 --> 08:20.300
Attack her!

08:22.269 --> 08:25.806
But now she's just being
a nine-toed drama queen.

08:25.839 --> 08:27.775
Now the network wants me
to write her a letter

08:27.808 --> 08:29.610
begging her
to do the show?

08:29.643 --> 08:32.112
Rogelio de la Vega doesn't beg!

08:32.145 --> 08:35.148
Except for my wife's
forgiveness.

08:35.182 --> 08:37.685
I've been focused
on myself again.

08:37.718 --> 08:39.152
Old habits die hard.

08:39.186 --> 08:41.722
Please, how are you?

08:41.755 --> 08:42.890
I want to only hear about you.

08:42.923 --> 08:44.925
I'm good.

08:44.958 --> 08:47.127
Work's been busy,
because I've been

08:47.160 --> 08:49.062
covering for another
teacher who's sick.

08:49.096 --> 08:50.330
Who's sick?

08:50.363 --> 08:51.565
Hmm?

08:51.599 --> 08:52.800
That you're covering for.

08:52.833 --> 08:54.602
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm not used

08:54.635 --> 08:55.636
to all the questions.

08:55.669 --> 08:56.904
Rory.

08:56.937 --> 08:57.905
Rory's sick.

09:00.841 --> 09:02.910
Sorry. I have
to take this.

09:05.178 --> 09:07.681
Also suspicious?

09:10.784 --> 09:12.085
*

09:42.816 --> 09:45.185
Okay. Now call Petra.

09:46.219 --> 09:48.722
*

09:59.366 --> 10:02.870
No! Don't read that review
again!

10:14.114 --> 10:16.717
CRITIC JANE:
Ugh. Derivative

10:16.750 --> 10:18.051
and uninspired.

10:18.085 --> 10:21.254
That reviewer
was 100% right.

10:21.288 --> 10:23.857
Only he sugarcoated it.

10:23.891 --> 10:25.325
No. This isn't healthy.

10:25.358 --> 10:27.160
Choose to ignore.

10:29.429 --> 10:31.331
I'm not going anywhere.

10:31.364 --> 10:33.667
Here's the truth.

10:33.701 --> 10:35.803
An outrageous series
of events happened to you,

10:35.836 --> 10:39.006
and you exploited it for the
sake of a novel, and it sold.

10:39.039 --> 10:41.709
But without that,
you'd be nowhere.

10:41.742 --> 10:43.711
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Like I said,
everyone's a critic.

10:43.744 --> 10:45.145
Admit it, Jane.

10:45.178 --> 10:46.814
You're a fraud.

10:46.847 --> 10:49.182
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Especially Jane.

10:55.956 --> 10:57.791
Yes! Just the
person I need to see!

10:57.825 --> 10:59.392
How does this sound? Okay.

10:59.426 --> 11:01.161
"Dear River, I'm begging you,

11:01.194 --> 11:03.931
"don't miss out on the greatest
opportunity of your career

11:03.964 --> 11:06.466
"just because I accidentally
got you attacked by a wolf.

11:06.499 --> 11:09.369
"To do so would be
a huge mistake in a career

11:09.402 --> 11:11.071
littered with mistakes..."

11:11.104 --> 11:12.840
What What are you doing?!
Why are you deleting it?!

11:12.873 --> 11:14.207
Because you're
gonna have to be,

11:14.241 --> 11:15.408
like, a hundred
times more humble.

11:15.442 --> 11:17.277
Where's Mom?

11:17.310 --> 11:20.013
Ah, yes, my wife,

11:20.047 --> 11:22.282
International
Woman of Mystery.

11:22.315 --> 11:24.017
She's not here.

11:24.051 --> 11:26.086
Early shift. Again.

11:26.119 --> 11:28.255
Why are you saying
it like that?

11:28.288 --> 11:31.859
Because your mom has been
distant and secretive lately.

11:31.892 --> 11:34.027
Dad?
Hmm?

11:34.061 --> 11:36.964
Don't let your telenovela
instincts get the better of you.

11:36.997 --> 11:38.498
You're probably right.

11:38.531 --> 11:40.167
I just miss her.

11:40.200 --> 11:41.869
Well, then why don't you
do something special,

11:41.902 --> 11:43.871
just the two of you?

11:43.904 --> 11:45.238
Yes?
Mm-hmm.

11:45.272 --> 11:46.874
That's a wonderful idea!

11:46.907 --> 11:48.508
I will go all out!

11:48.541 --> 11:51.311
A Xogelio Extravaganza!

11:51.344 --> 11:53.413
Again, check your
telenovela instincts.

11:53.446 --> 11:55.448
Small and intimate works, too.

11:55.482 --> 11:57.517
Yes, yes, yes, you're right.

11:57.550 --> 11:59.853
Smart advice
from my brilliant daughter.

11:59.887 --> 12:02.756
Oh.
Let me return the favor.
What did you need from your mom?

12:02.790 --> 12:04.224
How can I help?
It's nothing.

12:04.257 --> 12:06.126
I just wanted to vent
because I'm blocked.

12:06.159 --> 12:07.961
Need a laxative

12:12.065 --> 12:13.533
With my writing. Writer's block.

12:13.566 --> 12:16.103
Because I can't get my bad
review out of my head.

12:22.843 --> 12:24.912
I'm going to show
you something.

12:24.945 --> 12:27.347
Something no one
has ever seen before.

12:38.391 --> 12:40.894
Open it.

12:41.929 --> 12:43.831
It's my Failure Folder.

12:43.864 --> 12:48.969
The bleakest, most soul-crushing
reviews of my career.

12:58.545 --> 13:00.580
Geez, Dad, these are harsh.

13:00.613 --> 13:04.151
Yes. And had I let them
get into my head,

13:04.184 --> 13:07.187
I would have never become
the successful,

13:07.220 --> 13:09.489
prolific actor
standing before you.

13:09.522 --> 13:11.959
How did you do it?
I rebranded them.

13:11.992 --> 13:14.061
This is no longer
my Failure Folder.

13:14.094 --> 13:15.896
It is my Motivation Folder.

13:15.929 --> 13:19.432
All these harsh words
from bitter, mean critics?

13:19.466 --> 13:21.234
They're nothing but fuel,

13:21.268 --> 13:23.937
urging me to overcome,
show them all.

13:23.971 --> 13:26.073
Well, that's good advice, Dad,

13:26.106 --> 13:28.842
but it's a little different
for me because...
I know.

13:28.876 --> 13:31.478
I'm a star, but normal
people can be resilient, too.

13:31.511 --> 13:33.947
No, but I'm literally stuck.

13:33.981 --> 13:35.949
I can't write.

13:35.983 --> 13:38.051
Just get the critic
out of your head!
No, but...

13:38.085 --> 13:39.519
I'm hearing a lot
of "no buts."

13:39.552 --> 13:42.122
I want to hear
more "yes, and."

13:42.155 --> 13:45.492
Yes, and.
It's perfect!
Huh?

13:45.525 --> 13:48.095
"Yes, and" is the first rule
of improv.

13:48.128 --> 13:49.963
That's the cure
for your writer's block.

13:49.997 --> 13:53.233
Take an improv class!
I'm a genius.

13:53.266 --> 13:55.535
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
There's that lack
of confidence again.

13:55.568 --> 13:57.370
What does improv have
to do with writing?

13:57.404 --> 13:59.372
It's a way to get
your creative juices flowing

13:59.406 --> 14:01.341
without worrying
about your actual writing.

14:01.374 --> 14:03.210
It'll force you
to stop self-censoring,

14:03.243 --> 14:06.546
to dive in and commit
to new ideas.

14:06.579 --> 14:09.616
I'm not an
actor, Dad.
Who cares?

14:09.649 --> 14:12.052
It's just to help you
to think on your feet.

14:12.085 --> 14:14.154
Reclaim your creative self.
CRITIC JANE:
Yeah.

14:14.187 --> 14:17.590
Your derivative,
uninspired self.

14:17.624 --> 14:20.593
Come on, Jane. You can't.

14:20.627 --> 14:23.030
You know what?
Yes, I'll sign up.

14:23.063 --> 14:24.664
Yes!

14:24.697 --> 14:26.499
CRITIC JANE:
Onstage failure. Huh.

14:26.533 --> 14:30.037
What a dramatic twist.

14:30.070 --> 14:33.240
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Which brings us here, now.

14:35.242 --> 14:37.444
Petra?!
I knew

14:37.477 --> 14:40.113
I couldn't trust you.

14:44.217 --> 14:45.552
I'm being followed. I
think it's the blackmailer.

14:45.585 --> 14:47.054
I'm gonna kiss you again,

14:47.087 --> 14:49.089
and then we're gonna
get back in the car.

14:53.193 --> 14:54.627
Who's following you?

14:54.661 --> 14:56.563
I don't know.

14:56.596 --> 14:58.531
Someone's been
tailing me all day.

14:58.565 --> 15:01.701
Do you know anyone with a
late model olive green sedan?

15:01.734 --> 15:03.636
Ew. No.

15:03.670 --> 15:05.538
What the hell were you
doing here anyway?

15:05.572 --> 15:07.640
I was supposed to meet
with the blackmailers.

15:07.674 --> 15:09.309
No, you weren't.

15:09.342 --> 15:12.045
I planted that burner phone,
I sent those texts.

15:12.079 --> 15:13.580
What?

15:13.613 --> 15:15.582
To see if you'd actually
reach out to me

15:15.615 --> 15:17.450
if you heard from them,
which you didn't.

15:17.484 --> 15:19.152
Only because I'm
being followed!

15:19.186 --> 15:21.154
And you've been
so strung out!

15:21.188 --> 15:23.690
I don't want to risk you
messing anything up.

15:29.762 --> 15:32.132
They're still watching.

15:32.165 --> 15:34.067
I know that.

15:34.101 --> 15:36.203
Now what?

15:36.236 --> 15:38.138
I'll tell them you were
getting suspicious,

15:38.171 --> 15:39.739
so I had to seduce you.

15:48.381 --> 15:50.550
Must be my cell.
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Too many phones.

15:50.583 --> 15:53.620
We have to go.
It's my mom.

15:53.653 --> 15:56.356
It's a marriage record.
My mom's.

15:56.389 --> 15:58.491
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Ah, this must be the letter

15:58.525 --> 16:00.727
they were expecting
from Italy.
What does it say?

16:00.760 --> 16:04.764
She married someone
named Angello Amalberti.

16:04.797 --> 16:08.268
So maybe her name is
Camilla Amalberti now?

16:09.436 --> 16:11.338
Should we look her up?

16:14.674 --> 16:16.643
If you're not ready...

16:16.676 --> 16:18.178
Uh, I am.

16:18.211 --> 16:19.479
Let's do it.

16:38.565 --> 16:41.034
Here's a match.
She looks the right age.

16:41.068 --> 16:44.171
Let's me see if I can
find out where she's from.

16:45.572 --> 16:48.108
Oh, my God.

16:49.309 --> 16:51.611
Rafael, I think this is her.

16:54.614 --> 16:57.150
Wow.

16:57.184 --> 16:59.719
That's my mom.

17:10.497 --> 17:13.466
I can't believe
that's really her.

17:13.500 --> 17:16.069
She looks...

17:16.103 --> 17:18.771
kind, doesn't she?

17:18.805 --> 17:20.507
She really does.

17:22.442 --> 17:24.544
RAFAEL:
And you can see a little
family resemblance?

17:24.577 --> 17:26.179
Maybe?
Definitely.

17:30.617 --> 17:33.153
What do you want to do?

17:34.354 --> 17:36.389
Uh, write her.
Oh.

17:36.423 --> 17:39.792
And now before
I lose my nerve.

17:41.594 --> 17:43.163
J.R.:
Mom?

17:43.196 --> 17:44.731
WOMAN:
We gave her a sedative.

17:44.764 --> 17:47.600
She was disoriented,
very upset.

17:51.338 --> 17:53.540
Are you okay?

17:53.573 --> 17:55.475
I don't know if it
was the right thing,

17:55.508 --> 17:57.244
putting her here.

17:57.277 --> 17:59.279
Is that...?

17:59.312 --> 18:01.348
Yes, it's them.

18:05.352 --> 18:07.320
Okay, what now?

18:07.354 --> 18:09.422
Oh, I text them back
our cover story.

18:09.456 --> 18:11.158
You were suspicious,

18:11.191 --> 18:13.426
I seduced you so
I can get closer to you

18:13.460 --> 18:14.827
and force you to
incriminate yourself.

18:14.861 --> 18:16.463
You think they'll believe that?

18:16.496 --> 18:18.698
What?
That I was seduced.

18:18.731 --> 18:21.601
I wouldn't worry.

18:21.634 --> 18:23.336
You were pretty
into that kiss.

18:23.370 --> 18:27.174
What?! No, I wasn't.

18:27.207 --> 18:29.176
Text them back,
make it convincing.

18:29.209 --> 18:31.211
ROGELIO:
Don't be nervous.

18:31.244 --> 18:34.347
Getting out of your comfort zone
is what improv is all about.

18:34.381 --> 18:36.716
And remember, Jane, you have
highly-gifted actor's blood

18:36.749 --> 18:38.451
coursing through your veins!

18:38.485 --> 18:40.487
Thanks, Dad.
ROGELIO:
No, thank you

18:40.520 --> 18:42.222
for the advice.
I'm on my way

18:42.255 --> 18:44.324
to surprise your mother
with a night of romance.

18:44.357 --> 18:45.625
You didn't go too big, did you?

18:45.658 --> 18:47.194
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Well...

18:47.227 --> 18:48.628
She will love it.

18:48.661 --> 18:51.831
Good luck at improv,
and remember, "yes, and"!

18:51.864 --> 18:54.167
Got it. On it.

19:05.912 --> 19:07.547
Hello, good sir.

19:07.580 --> 19:09.916
I'm here to wait for the
enchanting Xiomara de la Vega.

19:09.949 --> 19:11.418
Xo isn't working today.

19:11.451 --> 19:13.786
Are you sure?
Yup.

19:13.820 --> 19:15.455
Hasn't been in all week.

19:16.656 --> 19:18.391
Oh.

19:18.425 --> 19:20.793
Okay. Thanks.

19:28.635 --> 19:30.403
MAN:
Establish a location.
That's rule number

19:30.437 --> 19:32.305
three of improv.

19:34.841 --> 19:37.477
Rule number two--

19:37.510 --> 19:39.379
add new information.

19:39.412 --> 19:41.514
And rule number one?

19:42.915 --> 19:45.452
Yes, and.

19:45.485 --> 19:47.720
Exactly, which means accept
what is given to you

19:47.754 --> 19:49.756
and add on to it. Get it?

19:49.789 --> 19:51.824
Got it.
Good. Now let's
get you up on your feet.

19:51.858 --> 19:54.727
Oh, no.
You mean, "Oh, yes."

19:54.761 --> 19:57.230
Sorry. Oh, yes! And...

19:57.264 --> 19:58.931
here I go.

19:58.965 --> 20:01.468
Great. Mark,
join her.

20:02.635 --> 20:04.671
Class, what
is he holding?

20:04.704 --> 20:06.439
A microphone.

20:06.473 --> 20:09.909
Hello, New York.
Bob Edgars here

20:09.942 --> 20:12.745
with Mrs. Phyllis Runkle.

20:12.779 --> 20:16.416
Mrs. Runkle, I understand that
you were the sole eyewitness

20:16.449 --> 20:19.686
to the theft of the Statue
of Liberty late last night?

20:22.489 --> 20:24.624
Just say whatever pops
into your head.

20:26.293 --> 20:28.695
CRITIC JANE:
Except that.

20:28.728 --> 20:30.797
Don't say that.

20:30.830 --> 20:33.700
Did the thieves steal

20:33.733 --> 20:36.669
anything else?
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Her voice, apparently.

20:36.703 --> 20:39.472
Come on, Jane.
Remember the rules of improv.

20:39.506 --> 20:41.874
Yes, and...

20:41.908 --> 20:44.911
Don't be derivative, Jane.
I can't bear it.

20:44.944 --> 20:49.382
Nope. Don't say that.
It's painfully prosaic.

20:50.517 --> 20:51.918
Did you catch

20:51.951 --> 20:54.587
a glimpse of their faces?

20:54.621 --> 20:57.790
Yes. I saw the thieves, and

20:57.824 --> 21:00.460
they took the Statue of Liberty

21:00.493 --> 21:02.795
and my virginity.

21:02.829 --> 21:04.631
By force.

21:04.664 --> 21:07.934
And it was scary, and...

21:07.967 --> 21:10.370
ROGELIO:
Stop. This is the house.

21:26.486 --> 21:30.323
Take your hands off my wife,
you thieving, toned bastard.

21:30.357 --> 21:32.825
I will rip you
limb from limb!

21:32.859 --> 21:34.827
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
So much for not letting his
telenovela instincts

21:34.861 --> 21:36.329
get the better of him.

21:36.363 --> 21:38.030
Rogelio! Stop!
No!

21:38.064 --> 21:39.332
I know about the affair.

21:39.366 --> 21:40.333
Affair?

21:40.367 --> 21:42.635
Brad's my dance partner.

21:42.669 --> 21:43.770
We entered a competition.

21:43.803 --> 21:45.605
You expect me to believe that?

21:45.638 --> 21:48.007
Yes.
Hey, get your hands off
my boyfriend.

21:51.811 --> 21:53.980
So-so, he-he-he really is...

21:54.013 --> 21:56.015
My dance partner. Yes.

22:04.891 --> 22:08.495
I can't believe you thought
I'd cheat on you.

22:08.528 --> 22:09.896
I'm sorry.

22:09.929 --> 22:11.698
I-I think that
being home all day

22:11.731 --> 22:14.434
has made me a little crazy.

22:14.467 --> 22:15.902
But why did you lie?

22:15.935 --> 22:20.440
I was... embarrassed.

22:20.473 --> 22:22.775
It's just a little
dance contest.

22:22.809 --> 22:25.378
I mean, compared
to what you do.

22:25.412 --> 22:26.846
This isn't about me.

22:28.981 --> 22:32.919
I guess... I'm just feeling
a little lost,

22:32.952 --> 22:36.055
and I wanted to have fun

22:36.088 --> 22:39.792
and rediscover
my love of dancing.

22:39.826 --> 22:41.928
So let me support that.

22:41.961 --> 22:43.696
I promise, Xiomara,

22:43.730 --> 22:45.998
I will not make
it all about me.

22:46.032 --> 22:49.101
ROGELIO :
* Xiomara...

22:49.135 --> 22:51.070
Not now, driver!

22:53.740 --> 22:56.676
JANE:
No. Improv is not for me.

22:56.709 --> 22:58.678
I totally bombed.

22:58.711 --> 23:00.547
No way I'm going back there.

23:00.580 --> 23:02.081
What?

23:02.114 --> 23:03.683
You can't quit, it's
only been a day.

23:03.716 --> 23:05.818
I can and I am.

23:05.852 --> 23:07.520
Would you let me quit?

23:08.855 --> 23:11.157
Okay, shut up.
I'll start my homework.

23:11.190 --> 23:14.060
Bright side?
You love homework.

23:24.103 --> 23:25.705
What are you doing?

23:25.738 --> 23:28.140
My homework. This week
I'm supposed to observe

23:28.174 --> 23:30.810
the people around me and really
notice their gestures and quirks

23:30.843 --> 23:32.779
and then use them
to write up a character.

23:32.812 --> 23:35.682
Okay.

23:35.715 --> 23:39.686
So, uh, what else are
you observing about me?

23:39.719 --> 23:42.822
You want to stop talking
and just have sex.

23:42.855 --> 23:44.991
Nice work. I
think your homework

23:45.024 --> 23:47.560
is pretty much done
for the night.

23:48.160 --> 23:50.497
Mmm.

23:50.530 --> 23:53.933
Okay. Now you're about
to get sappy.

23:53.966 --> 23:56.936
I just feel so...
Hmm.

23:56.969 --> 23:59.205
happy... here.

23:59.238 --> 24:01.007
With you, in
this apartment

24:01.040 --> 24:02.942
that still smells
like hot dogs.

24:02.975 --> 24:05.144
And I can't even believe
I am saying that,

24:05.177 --> 24:06.846
but it's true.

24:06.879 --> 24:08.180
It just feels right.

24:08.214 --> 24:09.248
What?

24:09.281 --> 24:11.484
CRITIC JANE:
Don't say it, Jane.

24:11.518 --> 24:13.653
Censor yourself.
Bite your tongue.

24:13.686 --> 24:16.155
Nothing.

24:16.188 --> 24:19.025
I'm happy, too.
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Also biting his tongue...

24:21.694 --> 24:24.597
I-- Let's try from
that last eight count.

24:24.631 --> 24:26.499
Five, six, seven, eight.

24:26.533 --> 24:29.068
*

24:29.101 --> 24:31.604
Ah. Ah.

24:31.638 --> 24:32.939
Ah.

24:35.074 --> 24:36.909
Did you want to
say something?

24:36.943 --> 24:39.646
Only that you two dance...

24:39.679 --> 24:41.648
beautifully together.

24:41.681 --> 24:43.115
It's enchanting.

24:44.684 --> 24:45.785
One more time?

24:45.818 --> 24:47.920
Uh, yes.

24:47.954 --> 24:50.823
And we're pushing
off with the left leg.
Right.

24:50.857 --> 24:53.693
*

25:12.979 --> 25:14.981
ROGELIO:
Lovely. Wonderful.

25:15.014 --> 25:17.216
Keep it up.

25:17.249 --> 25:19.185
Amazing. Brilliant.

25:19.218 --> 25:22.254
Coming from a
totally casual observer.

25:22.288 --> 25:25.157
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Ah, another casual observer.

25:32.264 --> 25:34.333
PETRA:
Jane

25:34.366 --> 25:35.401
Did you hurt yourself again?

25:35.434 --> 25:37.570
Oh. No, no. No, no, no, no, no.
Just getting back

25:37.604 --> 25:38.905
into the swing of waitressing.

25:38.938 --> 25:40.840
Thanks for letting me
pick up shifts.

25:49.181 --> 25:50.583
Did you just giggle?

25:50.617 --> 25:52.619
No.

25:52.652 --> 25:53.986
I do not giggle.

25:54.020 --> 25:56.188
You did. You giggled,

25:56.222 --> 25:58.257
and you're blushing--
Who was that?

25:58.290 --> 25:59.592
No one.

25:59.626 --> 26:01.093
And I'm not.

26:01.127 --> 26:02.261
Oh, my God.
You have a crush.

26:02.294 --> 26:03.596
Did someone just ask you
to the prom?

26:03.630 --> 26:05.665
No. I do not have a crush,

26:05.698 --> 26:07.133
and no one's going to prom.

26:07.166 --> 26:08.835
And I do not giggle.

26:08.868 --> 26:10.269
I have never giggled
a day in my life.

26:10.302 --> 26:12.739
Giggling is for peasants.

26:12.772 --> 26:14.674
Are you Shrek?

26:14.707 --> 26:16.275
No. I'm being Auntie Petra.

26:16.308 --> 26:18.144
Mm-mm.
Mmm. Yeah.

26:18.177 --> 26:20.880
I think the, uh, accent was
a little confusing.

26:20.913 --> 26:22.615
Mmm.
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Like I said,

26:22.649 --> 26:24.751
everyone's a critic.

26:24.784 --> 26:26.686
Okay, what if I do
my dad? He's quirky.

26:26.719 --> 26:28.354
And definitely a larger than
life personality.

26:28.387 --> 26:31.023
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
True dat.
Beautiful. Yes.

26:31.057 --> 26:33.626
Incredible.
I only hope

26:33.660 --> 26:35.227
the camera can capture
your magnificence.

26:35.261 --> 26:37.129
Water break?

26:37.163 --> 26:38.297
Lemon or no lemon?

26:38.330 --> 26:40.299
Oh, uh, lemon.
Oh, my God, no.

26:40.332 --> 26:41.968
No lemon?
Would you like a Gatorade?

26:42.001 --> 26:44.771
You need to make sure to
replenish your electrolytes.

26:44.804 --> 26:46.172
I also cut up some
orange slices,

26:46.205 --> 26:47.774
if you would like...
No!

26:47.807 --> 26:48.908
I don't want any of it.

26:48.941 --> 26:50.877
Just stop it. Enough.

26:50.910 --> 26:53.412
I'll just, um, gonna use
the restroom.

26:55.214 --> 26:57.383
What's going on?

26:57.416 --> 26:58.785
Stop what?

26:58.818 --> 27:00.653
Everything. You.

27:00.687 --> 27:02.755
But I'm not making this
about myself at all.

27:02.789 --> 27:04.757
I'm all about you.
Exactly.

27:04.791 --> 27:06.693
That's the problem.

27:06.726 --> 27:08.194
You're suffocating me.

27:08.227 --> 27:09.829
What?
It's true.

27:09.862 --> 27:12.364
You used to go to work
every day,

27:12.398 --> 27:14.801
so I had alone time,
and I need that,

27:14.834 --> 27:17.236
because, well,

27:17.269 --> 27:20.206
you're such a big personality,
and being around you all day,

27:20.239 --> 27:21.941
every day is exhausting.

27:21.974 --> 27:24.711
But I love being around you
all day, every day.

27:24.744 --> 27:26.879
That's because
I'm not exhausting.

27:29.849 --> 27:31.684
Well, I'm sorry.

27:31.718 --> 27:35.354
I didn't realize how much of my
personality was problematic.

27:37.389 --> 27:39.358
JANE:
Well that wasn't funny either.

27:39.391 --> 27:40.426
What am I gonna do in class?

27:40.459 --> 27:41.994
Well it's improv, right?

27:42.028 --> 27:43.295
Can't you just wing it?

27:43.329 --> 27:45.965
No, we have to write them up.

27:45.998 --> 27:48.267
And I took this class to
get away from writing.

27:48.300 --> 27:49.836
It's not a novel.

27:49.869 --> 27:51.370
It doesn't matter what it is.

27:51.403 --> 27:53.706
I have this critic in my head,

27:53.740 --> 27:55.908
judging and second-guessing.

27:55.942 --> 27:57.376
It's crippling.

27:57.409 --> 27:58.878
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
And, friends,

27:58.911 --> 28:00.379
from experience, that's true.

28:00.412 --> 28:02.248
You can't make progress

28:02.281 --> 28:03.983
if you're constantly
second-guessing yourself.

28:04.016 --> 28:06.218
What's with this critic?

28:06.252 --> 28:08.187
Honestly, it-it happens to me
sometimes.

28:08.220 --> 28:09.989
I think it's the pressure
of telling such

28:10.022 --> 28:11.357
a fast-paced story.
Talk to me.

28:11.390 --> 28:13.359
I just...

28:13.392 --> 28:15.027
Like, should I tell you
what Jane

28:15.061 --> 28:18.464
was really feeling here,
or not? I will.

28:18.497 --> 28:20.833
I just...
Actually, no.

28:20.867 --> 28:23.936
I'll save it for later.
Let's go back.

28:23.970 --> 28:27.974
I didn't realize how much of my
personality was problematic.

28:28.007 --> 28:30.009
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
See

28:36.382 --> 28:37.817
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
You'll recall we left Jane,
mired in...

28:37.850 --> 28:39.952
Self doubt.
Every idea I have,

28:39.986 --> 28:43.522
there's this voice
that won't go away.

28:43.555 --> 28:44.857
What voice?

28:44.891 --> 28:46.158
Me.

28:46.192 --> 28:47.393
My inner critic.

28:47.426 --> 28:49.261
And I can't seem
to shut her up.

28:49.295 --> 28:51.297
Why would you want
to shut her up?
Ugh.

28:51.330 --> 28:53.065
No, I listen to that voice
all the time.

28:53.099 --> 28:54.200
She's got some valid points.

28:54.233 --> 28:56.402
Ha.
I'm not kidding.

28:56.435 --> 28:59.906
But if I listen to
her, then that means

28:59.939 --> 29:02.809
I have to accept that
that review was right.

29:02.842 --> 29:04.376
I shouldn't be a writer.

29:04.410 --> 29:08.080
But that's-that's not
what the review said.

29:08.114 --> 29:10.382
Okay, that I'm "derivative
and uninspired."

29:10.416 --> 29:12.518
No, at times "your manufactured

29:12.551 --> 29:15.221
coincidences were
derivative and uninspired."

29:15.254 --> 29:18.024
I read the review
a couple times, too.

29:19.525 --> 29:21.360
Well, clearly, he doesn't
think I'm a good writer.

29:21.393 --> 29:23.830
Then why did he say there was
"promise unfulfilled"?

29:23.863 --> 29:25.998
That means
you have promise.

29:26.032 --> 29:28.968
And the rest was all just
constructive criticism.

29:29.001 --> 29:30.502
So maybe you shouldn't be trying

29:30.536 --> 29:33.105
to banish this critic,
you should be trying

29:33.139 --> 29:36.375
to see what he said
as productive.

29:36.408 --> 29:41.848
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
And so, friends, Jane tried.

29:41.881 --> 29:43.883
Don't forget, the reviewer said

29:43.916 --> 29:45.818
you used too many
adjectives before.

29:45.852 --> 29:49.555
Yes, and this time I'm
going to pare it down.

29:49.588 --> 29:52.024
And he said you shouldn't

29:52.058 --> 29:55.094
be too removed
from your subject.
Yes.

29:55.127 --> 29:58.965
And this time, I'm drawing
straight from my real life.

29:58.998 --> 30:01.000
Hmm. I should go.

30:01.033 --> 30:03.035
We don't want to overdo
the magical realism.

30:06.873 --> 30:10.309
Hey, Dad.
Have you heard from your mom?

30:10.342 --> 30:11.978
No. Is everything okay?
I mean,

30:12.011 --> 30:14.313
not really. She said some
pretty awful things

30:14.346 --> 30:16.115
and I made her lemon water

30:16.148 --> 30:17.449
and orange slices,
and I bit my tongue

30:17.483 --> 30:19.118
so hard that...

30:19.151 --> 30:20.386
Dad, slow down.

30:20.419 --> 30:21.921
What did mom say?

30:21.954 --> 30:23.990
Horrific things, Jane.
Things I will spend

30:24.023 --> 30:25.457
my life trying to unhear.

30:25.491 --> 30:27.526
Okay. Stop.

30:27.559 --> 30:30.529
Instead of locking
those things away

30:30.562 --> 30:33.199
in a fake book with a key
that leads to an armoire,

30:33.232 --> 30:36.168
just try to consider

30:36.202 --> 30:38.938
what she said, because I decided

30:38.971 --> 30:41.173
to "yes, and" my critic,

30:41.207 --> 30:42.574
and i-it actually helped me.

30:42.608 --> 30:44.576
Perfect. Great advice.

30:44.610 --> 30:46.212
Talk soon.

30:46.245 --> 30:47.880
See?

30:47.914 --> 30:49.015
I actually think
she has a point.

30:49.048 --> 30:50.049
Who are you?

30:50.082 --> 30:52.184
I am your inner critic

30:52.218 --> 30:55.454
and I'm finally out, baby!

30:55.487 --> 30:57.924
I've been waiting 44 years

30:57.957 --> 30:59.191
to be set free, and, boy,

30:59.225 --> 31:00.927
have I got some things

31:00.960 --> 31:02.428
* To say!

31:02.461 --> 31:04.430
Okay, only 41 years.
No!

31:04.463 --> 31:06.999
You're 44, you delusional
half-wit.

31:07.033 --> 31:08.935
You ever hear the theory
about famous people?

31:08.968 --> 31:10.336
They stop maturing

31:10.369 --> 31:12.404
the moment they become famous,
and you booked

31:12.438 --> 31:16.375
our first national commercial
when you were... nine.

31:16.408 --> 31:18.044
Bam! Freeze it right there,

31:18.077 --> 31:20.646
you whiny little thumb-sucking
man-child.

31:20.679 --> 31:23.082
Are you done?
No!

31:23.115 --> 31:25.151
Your pompous, shallow,
materialistic,

31:25.184 --> 31:27.553
loud, obnoxious, selfish,

31:27.586 --> 31:29.088
irresponsible...
Okay, okay. Stop it.

31:29.121 --> 31:31.257
I can't take it anymore.
You're too much.

31:31.290 --> 31:34.093
Exactly.

31:34.126 --> 31:36.228
And I am you.

31:36.262 --> 31:40.032
So maybe now you know
how your wife feels.

31:43.635 --> 31:45.637
*

31:54.513 --> 31:56.182
I'm so glad
you came home.

31:56.215 --> 31:59.085
I was too harsh with you, and...

31:59.118 --> 32:01.187
I feel terrible.

32:01.220 --> 32:02.721
I'm so sorry.

32:02.754 --> 32:04.023
No.

32:04.056 --> 32:05.557
I'm the one who's sorry.

32:05.591 --> 32:07.593
A-And I came back
to apologize.

32:07.626 --> 32:09.128
You were right.

32:09.161 --> 32:10.997
I am a lot.

32:11.030 --> 32:13.265
Sometimes even for myself.

32:13.299 --> 32:15.634
I know you mean well.

32:15.667 --> 32:17.669
That doesn't mean it's not true.

32:17.703 --> 32:21.073
Look, I'm still adjusting.

32:21.107 --> 32:24.210
We've just never actually spent
this much time together before.

32:24.243 --> 32:25.544
I know.

32:25.577 --> 32:27.379
It feels like
we should have, right?

32:27.413 --> 32:29.648
Since we've known each other
for so long.

32:29.681 --> 32:33.219
Yeah. But really,
we're still newlyweds,

32:33.252 --> 32:35.121
and it takes time
to figure this all out.

32:35.154 --> 32:37.089
And we will.

32:37.123 --> 32:38.690
One step at a time.

32:38.724 --> 32:40.426
Just like dancing.

32:40.459 --> 32:42.294
Just like dancing.

32:47.733 --> 32:50.769
("Eres Tu"
by Carla Morrison playing)

32:50.802 --> 32:54.040
I know I'm no Brad, but...

32:54.073 --> 32:56.175
may I have this dance?

32:58.177 --> 33:00.479
*

33:03.049 --> 33:05.051
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
And in that moment, friends,

33:05.084 --> 33:08.187
Xiomara found exactly
what she was looking for:

33:08.220 --> 33:10.322
her love of dance.

33:13.559 --> 33:15.761
*

33:26.638 --> 33:28.340
*

33:28.374 --> 33:29.775
You're sure?

33:29.808 --> 33:32.611
Yes. Milos is still in jail,
so it can't be him.

33:32.644 --> 33:34.546
Well, it's always nice to cross
an international arms dealer

33:34.580 --> 33:36.348
off the list of people
who are after you.

33:36.382 --> 33:38.217
*

33:38.250 --> 33:40.018
What?

33:41.453 --> 33:43.622
I-I thought I had a crazy life,

33:43.655 --> 33:45.757
but yours...
You don't know

33:45.791 --> 33:47.526
the half of it.

33:54.666 --> 33:57.136
So, do you need to
stay over or anything?

33:58.837 --> 34:01.307
To sell the highly
improbable lie

34:01.340 --> 34:03.109
that I'm interested in you?

34:03.142 --> 34:04.776
Which we need them to believe.

34:04.810 --> 34:07.113
I think the tongue
you slipped me

34:07.146 --> 34:09.148
during our kiss
was pretty compelling.

34:09.181 --> 34:10.516
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR :
Oh, snap!

34:10.549 --> 34:12.718
What?

34:12.751 --> 34:15.654
That was a reflex.

34:15.687 --> 34:19.358
I could tell you had a plan--
I just didn't want to...

34:19.391 --> 34:21.360
undermine whatever it was.

34:21.393 --> 34:23.262
Good.

34:23.295 --> 34:25.697
Because I'm not into being
a straight woman's guinea pig.

34:28.734 --> 34:31.470
What makes you think I
haven't been with a woman?

34:31.503 --> 34:33.239
Have you?

34:33.272 --> 34:34.706
Yes.

34:34.740 --> 34:36.475
Several.

34:39.511 --> 34:43.315
I'm also your lawyer.

34:43.349 --> 34:46.618
That wouldn't be the first
line you've crossed.

34:50.456 --> 34:53.292
*

34:54.393 --> 34:55.694
Oh, my.

34:55.727 --> 34:58.197
I'm not the blackmailer,
but, whew,

34:58.230 --> 34:59.731
I am definitely buying
this is real.

35:11.443 --> 35:13.279
So...

35:13.312 --> 35:15.447
I enjoyed last night.

35:15.481 --> 35:18.550
That was... one way
to get me to relax.

35:18.584 --> 35:20.886
J.R.:
Yeah, it was fun.

35:23.355 --> 35:25.157
So, I just want to be honest.

35:26.858 --> 35:30.596
I've actually never been
with a woman before.

35:31.630 --> 35:32.831
:
Yeah.

35:32.864 --> 35:34.566
I have to be
honest, too.

35:34.600 --> 35:36.568
I knew that already.

35:37.636 --> 35:38.937
I have to visit my mom.

35:38.970 --> 35:40.306
I'll see you later.

35:40.339 --> 35:41.873
Great. Yeah, no,
I'm in a hurry, too.

35:41.907 --> 35:43.609
I have to get, uh,
to the lounge.

35:43.642 --> 35:44.743
Prep for an event.

35:44.776 --> 35:46.412
Nobody seems to work hard enough

35:46.445 --> 35:47.846
unless I'm breathing
down their necks.

35:49.715 --> 35:51.350
Breakfast
for two.

35:55.221 --> 35:57.456
IMPROV TEACHER:
You might have gone
a little overboard.

35:57.489 --> 35:59.591
An eight-page bio on a character
called "The Critic"?

35:59.625 --> 36:01.427
Just started flowing.

36:01.460 --> 36:02.861
Well, all right.
Could we get

36:02.894 --> 36:04.496
a suggestion
for The Critic to review?

36:04.530 --> 36:05.731
Sushi!

36:05.764 --> 36:07.633
With a mediocre seaweed

36:07.666 --> 36:09.735
and uninspired soy sauce,

36:09.768 --> 36:12.238
it reeks of promise unfulfilled.

36:12.271 --> 36:16.375
In short,
this fish stinks like dead fish.

36:18.410 --> 36:20.812
(coughs,
cricket chirping)

36:20.846 --> 36:23.249
CRITIC JANE :
Oh, that is so me.

36:23.282 --> 36:25.684
You nailed it!

36:25.717 --> 36:27.219
Ah. Are there

36:27.253 --> 36:28.920
Oscars for improv performances?

36:28.954 --> 36:31.957
Because I think the Academy
needs to consider this!

36:34.893 --> 36:36.895
Critic Jane definitely
isn't winning any awards.

36:36.928 --> 36:38.664
But you know what?

36:38.697 --> 36:41.567
It made me realize I should
go back to a writing class.

36:41.600 --> 36:44.670
The structure, having
assignments-- that works for me.

36:44.703 --> 36:46.605
And I really need that
right now.

36:46.638 --> 36:48.974
Mm-hmm. I like
that idea.

36:49.007 --> 36:51.543
Right? And look.

36:51.577 --> 36:53.679
Check plus!

36:53.712 --> 36:56.014
This is going
on the fridge.

36:57.516 --> 36:59.751
Or... in your drawer?

36:59.785 --> 37:01.753
There. See?

37:01.787 --> 37:03.855
Every time I bring it up,
you do that.

37:03.889 --> 37:06.592
What?
Look away.

37:06.625 --> 37:09.795
Look, I'm not trying to get
you to move in with me.

37:09.828 --> 37:12.398
I just want you to
feel... at home.

37:12.431 --> 37:14.733
I do feel at home.

37:14.766 --> 37:16.268
Then what's the problem?

37:16.302 --> 37:19.371
Uh, the problem is...

37:19.405 --> 37:21.673
Just say it.

37:21.707 --> 37:23.942
The problem is...

37:23.975 --> 37:26.812
everything feels
exactly right.

37:26.845 --> 37:29.481
Just like you said.

37:29.515 --> 37:31.617
It feels like
things are falling into place,

37:31.650 --> 37:34.420
and I'm exactly where
I'm supposed to be.

37:34.453 --> 37:37.556
And because of our history,
with Michael...

37:40.826 --> 37:43.962
I don't want him
to feel like just a step

37:43.995 --> 37:47.299
on my path back to you.

37:47.333 --> 37:50.902
I don't want this
to negate what we had, you know?

37:50.936 --> 37:53.372
I don't think it does.

37:53.405 --> 37:54.706
I think it's more...

37:54.740 --> 37:58.444
"yes, and."

37:59.978 --> 38:04.550
Yes, you and Michael had
a beautiful love story.

38:04.583 --> 38:09.455
And... I hope
that we can now have our own.

38:09.488 --> 38:11.990
Oh. Mmm.

38:12.023 --> 38:14.526
Mmm.

38:16.628 --> 38:18.597
Wow.

38:18.630 --> 38:20.499
I have no notes.
That was perfect.

38:20.532 --> 38:21.767
Oh.

38:21.800 --> 38:23.335
My dad.

38:23.369 --> 38:24.603
Of course.

38:24.636 --> 38:25.971
Hi, Dad.

38:27.373 --> 38:28.907
What, now?

38:44.690 --> 38:47.359
Ooh.

38:47.393 --> 38:49.395
Ah.

38:50.562 --> 38:52.664
What is it?

38:55.434 --> 38:58.404
I just got an e-mail.

38:58.437 --> 39:00.506
Camilla's not my mother.

39:00.539 --> 39:02.674
What?

39:02.708 --> 39:06.111
Ah. Turns out
she was just a nurse

39:06.144 --> 39:09.147
in the hospital
where I was born.

39:09.180 --> 39:13.585
The go-between for the hospital
and the convent's orphanage.

39:13.619 --> 39:15.721
My mom was scared
about what would happen

39:15.754 --> 39:17.623
if her family found out,

39:17.656 --> 39:20.058
so Camilla put her name
on my birth certificate.

39:20.091 --> 39:23.128
Does she know your mom's name?

39:25.096 --> 39:27.599
I am so sorry.

39:30.168 --> 39:32.771
Just...

39:32.804 --> 39:35.073
hard...

39:35.106 --> 39:37.609
preparing yourself, being ready,

39:37.643 --> 39:40.679
letting yourself hope.

39:40.712 --> 39:43.181
I know, but this is
just a setback, right?

39:43.214 --> 39:45.517
You can call the orphanage.

39:45.551 --> 39:47.853
Closed a long time ago.

39:47.886 --> 39:50.522
The convent then.
There must be records.

39:50.556 --> 39:52.858
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
True.

39:52.891 --> 39:54.660
This is a telenovela
after all.

39:54.693 --> 39:57.563
Why did my mother have a
note pinned on her sweater?

39:57.596 --> 40:01.500
On her sweater?!
Yes. Just pinned to her
like a frickin' sales tag.

40:01.533 --> 40:03.502
She said it was
an electrician?

40:03.535 --> 40:06.938
We didn't call an electrician.
Then who was in
my mother's room?

40:06.972 --> 40:10.776
Who left this note?

40:10.809 --> 40:14.513
And telenovelas, of course,
have twists and turns.

40:21.720 --> 40:23.855
They're killing it.

40:26.191 --> 40:28.560
(Xiomara groaning,
people gasping)

40:30.629 --> 40:33.064
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
They have ups... and downs.

40:33.098 --> 40:35.801
Uh, thanks for returning
my call, Sister Mary.

40:35.834 --> 40:38.837
I was looking for, uh, records
from the orphanage?

40:40.539 --> 40:42.474
They were sold?

40:42.508 --> 40:44.109
So

40:44.142 --> 40:46.812
You're absolutely sure?

40:46.845 --> 40:49.147
Luisa Alver?

40:49.180 --> 40:51.149
And they have gut punches

40:51.182 --> 40:52.951
that come out of nowhere.

40:54.586 --> 40:56.822
Oh, stop it, you guys.

40:56.855 --> 40:58.624
It hurts when I laugh.

40:58.657 --> 40:59.925
Oh.

40:59.958 --> 41:02.661
And don't you dare
call the judges.

41:02.694 --> 41:04.963
Why? You should have won,
even with the fall.

41:04.996 --> 41:07.165
Okay, wait.
An apple juice box toast

41:07.198 --> 41:09.167
to your critically-acclaimed
wipeout, huh?

41:09.200 --> 41:10.802
Salud.

41:10.836 --> 41:12.037
Ah. Shh, shh, shh, shh.

41:12.070 --> 41:13.672
JANE:
Oh, sorry.

41:13.705 --> 41:14.940
We're just having
a little fun.
Of course.

41:14.973 --> 41:16.675
It's good that you came in.

41:16.708 --> 41:18.176
You have a broken rib.

41:18.209 --> 41:20.612
Is that serious?
No.

41:20.646 --> 41:22.681
Just avoid excessive exertion.
It should heal up by itself.

41:22.714 --> 41:24.816
Got it. So, can
we get out of here?

41:24.850 --> 41:26.685
Actually,
there's something else.

41:26.718 --> 41:28.920
Could we talk in private?

41:28.954 --> 41:32.190
Well, this is my family.
They can stay.

41:34.225 --> 41:36.662
What is it?

41:36.695 --> 41:38.096
We took an X-ray
of your chest

41:38.129 --> 41:40.231
to check the rib,
and we found something else.

41:40.265 --> 41:42.233
A lump in your breast.

41:44.836 --> 41:47.706
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Like I said--
