01:32.050 --> 01:33.467
Police chief
has authorized his officers

01:33.593 --> 01:36.007
to use force
if necessary.

01:36.221 --> 01:38.847
It has been eight days
since Perez first witnessed

01:38.973 --> 01:42.351
the appearance of the
Virgin Mary on his windshield.

01:42.477 --> 01:44.478
Apparently,
Perez has the AIDS virus

01:44.604 --> 01:46.313
and believes this is a miracle.

01:46.439 --> 01:48.315
He has refused
to get out of his car.

01:48.441 --> 01:50.109
And as you can see,
the faithful have arrived

01:50.235 --> 01:52.736
from all across the state,
each and every one-

02:44.038 --> 02:45.956
Hi. Hey.

02:46.082 --> 02:49.668
Hey, how's it feel
to be my husband?

02:49.794 --> 02:52.671
Today I must say that I'm
the happiest man in the world.

03:03.975 --> 03:06.185
Someone shut that dog up!

03:24.787 --> 03:26.538
Shit.

03:29.083 --> 03:30.500
Excuse me. I'm so sorry.

03:30.627 --> 03:32.419
Can I use your cell phone?
It's an emergency.

03:32.545 --> 03:33.587
Yeah.
- Oh, thank you so much.

03:33.713 --> 03:34.755
Just- you're so kind.

03:34.881 --> 03:36.882
Just one minute, one minute.

03:43.348 --> 03:45.682
Oh, thank God
you're still there.

03:45.808 --> 03:48.685
How's he doing?

03:48.811 --> 03:51.730
Can I speak with him, please?

03:53.233 --> 03:54.441
Hi.

03:54.567 --> 03:56.777
Hi, honey, it's Mommy.

03:56.903 --> 03:58.111
How you doing, sweet pea?

03:58.238 --> 03:59.196
How you doing?
I miss you.

03:59.322 --> 04:01.031
I miss you so much.

04:01.157 --> 04:02.950
I'm on this date,
and it's going so well.

04:03.076 --> 04:04.910
It's going really, really well.

04:05.036 --> 04:08.205
His name is David,
and he really likes me.

04:08.331 --> 04:09.456
I think he really likes me,

04:09.582 --> 04:11.708
and he even wants
to take me to Paris.

04:11.834 --> 04:13.877
I think I got it right.

04:14.003 --> 04:16.088
I think I got it right
this time.

04:23.930 --> 04:25.681
David.

04:25.807 --> 04:27.808
Yes?

04:27.934 --> 04:30.018
I really didn't mean to knock
that table over back there.

04:30.144 --> 04:31.561
I- I just-
I don't know what happened.

04:31.688 --> 04:34.940
I just- I'm so-
I'm so nervous,

04:35.066 --> 04:37.484
because I really like you,

04:37.610 --> 04:40.070
and I know this is
our first date and everything,

04:40.196 --> 04:41.613
and I know that it's probably
not the way

04:41.739 --> 04:45.575
that you wanted it to turn out,
but I can be better.

04:45.702 --> 04:47.327
I really, really
want to see you again,

04:47.453 --> 04:49.663
and I really want to prove
to you that I can be-

04:49.789 --> 04:51.790
I can be better than this.

04:56.671 --> 04:59.089
Do you remember Annie Hall,
the movie?

04:59.215 --> 05:02.175
I was just thinking about
the first date thing when,

05:02.302 --> 05:03.510
you know, Alvy and Annie,

05:03.636 --> 05:05.387
they talk about the first kiss
during their date,

05:05.513 --> 05:09.808
and they just sort of
get it out of the way.

05:09.934 --> 05:12.811
It just feels like that moment.

05:12.937 --> 05:14.438
Listen, Johnny.

05:14.564 --> 05:18.775
Hey, do you want to come in
for a minute?

05:18.901 --> 05:20.861
Good night, Johnny.

06:06.991 --> 06:09.493
Rudy?

06:09.619 --> 06:12.037
Where are you?

06:13.706 --> 06:16.249
Rudy?

06:16.376 --> 06:17.417
Rudy?

06:18.461 --> 06:20.754
# I found a new place
to dwell #

06:20.880 --> 06:23.423
# Well, it's down at the end
of the lonely street #

06:23.549 --> 06:26.885
# to Heartbreak Hotel #

06:27.011 --> 06:29.262
# I've been so lonely, baby #

06:29.389 --> 06:31.390
# You make me so lonely #

06:32.725 --> 06:35.060
# I get so lonely,
I could die #

06:38.439 --> 06:39.940
Hey, where's my dog?

06:40.066 --> 06:41.233
Can you not see
that I'm busy?

06:41.359 --> 06:43.485
Come on, man,
just have you seen him?

06:43.611 --> 06:45.529
No dogs allowed.
Read sign.

06:45.655 --> 06:47.114
Look, where the hell
is my dog?

06:47.240 --> 06:48.657
He took off, ran away.

06:48.783 --> 06:51.618
He was barking, barking,
barking like crazy,

06:51.744 --> 06:54.246
and I go to the door,
he took off, ran away.

06:54.372 --> 06:55.414
Not my fault.

06:55.540 --> 06:56.623
Your-

06:56.749 --> 06:58.625
I already told you
too many times.

06:58.751 --> 07:00.293
No dogs allowed!

07:00.420 --> 07:03.088
It just holds no value to me.

07:03.214 --> 07:04.131
Christ.

07:04.257 --> 07:05.715
What does that mean,
an act of faith?

07:07.260 --> 07:09.678
What?

07:11.055 --> 07:12.472
Oh, Christ.

07:12.598 --> 07:14.182
Oh, shit, I'm sorry.

07:14.308 --> 07:17.310
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.

07:17.437 --> 07:19.229
What were you doing
in the street, huh?

07:19.355 --> 07:22.649
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

07:30.450 --> 07:31.825
Come on.

07:33.953 --> 07:36.455
Come on.

07:56.100 --> 07:58.185
Do you feel a deep sense
of loneliness?

07:58.311 --> 07:59.728
Wish that you had
someone special

07:59.854 --> 08:01.396
to share your dreams with?

08:01.522 --> 08:03.857
Do you ever wonder
if there is that special person

08:03.983 --> 08:05.650
waiting out there just for you?

08:05.776 --> 08:09.279
You, sir,
are a lucky dog.

08:09.405 --> 08:11.615
You hear me?

08:11.741 --> 08:15.994
You're a lucky, lucky dog.

08:18.498 --> 08:21.208
That's what I'll call you.

08:21.334 --> 08:26.046
I'll call you Lucky.

08:26.172 --> 08:28.423
Welcome to your new home, Lucky.

08:50.363 --> 08:51.363
Welcome back.

08:53.074 --> 08:54.491
I'm just passing through.

08:55.701 --> 08:59.079
I don't have a lot of time
to waste.

08:59.205 --> 09:00.539
I had no choice.

09:02.708 --> 09:03.708
After you went down,

09:03.834 --> 09:06.836
the feds were watching me
like a hawk.

09:06.963 --> 09:09.172
I couldn't go down like that.

09:09.298 --> 09:11.091
Had a family to take care of.
- What about me?

09:11.217 --> 09:12.926
I didn't have a family?

09:13.052 --> 09:15.929
25 years I did,
25 years.

09:16.055 --> 09:17.138
You don't call.
You don't write.

09:17.265 --> 09:19.349
You don't do shit.
We're friends?

09:19.475 --> 09:21.309
I swear, I would kill you
if given a chance.

09:25.565 --> 09:28.149
Remember that job in Carson?

09:28.276 --> 09:30.068
You were young and stupid.

09:32.738 --> 09:36.908
Now you've repaid that debt
with your silence.

09:38.911 --> 09:41.162
This is who we are.

09:41.289 --> 09:43.373
This is the path we chose.

09:43.499 --> 09:46.042
I've come to accept it.

09:49.088 --> 09:50.755
How was she?

09:52.091 --> 09:54.217
My Mary?

09:54.343 --> 09:55.510
Did you see much of her?

09:56.804 --> 09:58.096
Beginning, yes.

09:58.222 --> 10:01.224
Not much again till the end.

10:02.268 --> 10:03.476
My name ever come up?

10:03.603 --> 10:05.729
No.

10:07.732 --> 10:10.567
But I don't think
she ever stopped loving you.

10:14.572 --> 10:17.907
It's what's owed to you...

10:18.034 --> 10:19.576
and everything you need to know.

10:25.458 --> 10:27.167
I hope the next time
we find each other

10:27.293 --> 10:29.461
is in heaven.

10:59.116 --> 11:01.451
Girl, what you doing?

11:01.577 --> 11:03.161
Whatever.

11:03.287 --> 11:05.330
Get off my corner, whore.

11:10.670 --> 11:12.087
Bitch, get to work.

11:16.509 --> 11:18.718
Look, honey, this is probably
your first time,

11:18.844 --> 11:21.471
so I'm going to spell out
the menu for you, okay?

11:21.597 --> 11:23.890
$20, I jerk you off.

11:24.016 --> 11:26.059
$100, you can fuck me
in the ass.

11:26.185 --> 11:28.061
A few dollars more,
you can come on my face.

11:28.187 --> 11:29.938
I don't care about
my mascara running,

11:30.064 --> 11:32.065
just don't get it
in my hair, okay?

11:32.191 --> 11:34.943
That's all you charge?

11:35.069 --> 11:39.197
Seriously, I think you're worth
much more than that.

11:39.323 --> 11:41.991
You look like a beautiful woman.

11:44.954 --> 11:46.538
That's very sweet of you,
honey,

11:46.664 --> 11:48.456
but for now I've got tits

11:48.582 --> 11:50.750
and eight inches
fully functional.

11:50.876 --> 11:53.253
But one day,
I dream to be flawless.

11:53.379 --> 11:55.296
What does that mean?

11:55.423 --> 11:58.842
To be tucked, operated on,
you know?

11:58.968 --> 12:00.427
Why haven't you done that?

12:00.553 --> 12:02.929
It's mucho dinero, señor.
- Oh.

12:03.055 --> 12:05.265
I'm saving up.

12:05.391 --> 12:07.642
How much do you make a night?

12:07.768 --> 12:09.394
What's it to you?

12:09.520 --> 12:11.396
Nothing, I just-
what is it, like, $400, $500-

12:11.522 --> 12:13.690
Stop the fucking car.
You're wasting my time.

12:13.816 --> 12:15.275
Stop the car.

12:22.158 --> 12:23.116
Gracias.

12:23.242 --> 12:27.245
Hold on, stay, stay.

12:27.371 --> 12:31.124
I need you to help me
save someone.

12:31.250 --> 12:32.876
Okay?

12:33.002 --> 12:35.920
I'll pay you.

12:36.046 --> 12:40.425
And I assure you
that if you do this, you-

12:40.551 --> 12:44.053
you'll probably never have to do
what you do ever again.

12:48.934 --> 12:53.104
I don't do anything
I don't want to do, okay?

12:53.230 --> 12:55.273
So what do you want from me?

12:55.399 --> 12:58.818
In the back of my car,
there's a backpack.

12:58.944 --> 13:01.780
I want you to open it.

13:01.906 --> 13:02.864
I want you to look inside.

13:02.990 --> 13:07.786
Inside, there's $50,000 cash.

13:07.912 --> 13:11.623
It's all the savings
I have left in the world,

13:11.749 --> 13:14.375
and I want you to have it

13:14.502 --> 13:16.628
if you just do me
this one service.

13:18.672 --> 13:22.842
There's a gun
in my glove compartment.

13:22.968 --> 13:25.428
And it's got two bullets
in the chamber.

13:30.684 --> 13:33.269
I want you to pick up that gun.

13:33.395 --> 13:39.025
I want you to hold it
really tight,

13:39.151 --> 13:45.323
and I want you to shoot me
right here in my heart.

13:48.202 --> 13:50.912
This is a fucking joke, right?

13:51.038 --> 13:53.164
Am I on TV or something?

13:53.290 --> 13:54.374
I've seen this shit on TV.

13:54.500 --> 13:55.959
There's little spy cameras
everywhere.

13:56.085 --> 13:57.210
I know this.

13:57.336 --> 13:58.962
I know, I know, Slim.

13:59.088 --> 14:00.296
He put you up to this,
didn't he?

14:00.422 --> 14:02.924
It's not a joke.
It's not a joke.

14:03.050 --> 14:05.260
There can't be any accidents.

14:09.807 --> 14:13.226
There's a suicide note
with my signature.

14:13.352 --> 14:15.061
So when they find me,

14:15.187 --> 14:18.565
you don't have to worry
about the authorities, okay?

14:21.527 --> 14:24.112
Why did you do that?

14:24.238 --> 14:27.907
Do what?

14:28.033 --> 14:29.158
Your goddamn prayer.

14:29.285 --> 14:31.744
Are you religious?

14:31.871 --> 14:32.829
Get out of my car.

14:32.955 --> 14:33.955
Do you not want
to burn in hell?

14:34.081 --> 14:35.081
Is that what it is?

14:35.207 --> 14:36.165
Get out.

14:36.292 --> 14:37.417
You fucking coward.

14:37.543 --> 14:39.335
So you search the streets
for people like me

14:39.461 --> 14:40.587
because we seem desperate?

14:40.713 --> 14:42.505
I said get out.
- You fucking coward.

14:42.631 --> 14:43.590
Get out of my car!

14:43.716 --> 14:45.550
So who cares, right?
- Get out!

14:45.676 --> 14:47.969
You go!
- Lay off of it!

14:48.095 --> 14:49.220
Everyone's got problems!

14:49.346 --> 14:50.305
Deal with it!
- Go!

14:50.431 --> 14:53.057
Mátate, pinche puto.

15:41.649 --> 15:44.275
I'm sorry.

15:58.415 --> 16:01.960
You're all right.

16:02.086 --> 16:05.630
Everything's gonna be all right.

16:54.763 --> 16:58.433
Just picture yourself
in the arms of such a goddess.

16:58.559 --> 16:59.892
Welcome to my world,

17:00.019 --> 17:03.855
to the excruciatingly erotic
world of Wild Velvet.

17:05.273 --> 17:09.277
We bring you all the ladies
that Victoria...

17:11.070 --> 17:14.490
Has been keeping
a big, big secret.

17:17.202 --> 17:22.582
And now the Wild Velvet
is proud to present

17:22.708 --> 17:27.170
the luscious,
the lascivious,

17:27.296 --> 17:32.425
the one, the only Scarlet.

17:32.551 --> 17:35.887
Love you, Scarlet!
- Whoo!

17:38.348 --> 17:45.146
# Emotionless this city lies #

17:45.272 --> 17:51.402
# Cruel it is,
it clouds my eyes #

17:51.528 --> 17:54.322
# The dark, the dark #

17:54.448 --> 17:56.491
# shades on my day #

17:56.617 --> 18:01.079
# I live inside this place #

18:04.750 --> 18:11.672
# Locked up
inside my metal cage #

18:11.799 --> 18:18.137
# Always tense
and filled with rage #

18:18.263 --> 18:23.017
# Above the concrete
fields below #

18:23.143 --> 18:27.438
# With you I want to go,
want to go #

18:27.564 --> 18:29.023
# Music is my sanctuary #

18:29.149 --> 18:31.067
# Music is my blanket #

18:31.193 --> 18:38.074
# I see only
what I want to see #

18:38.200 --> 18:43.621
# I'll be only
what I want to be #

18:43.747 --> 18:49.335
# Yeah #

18:49.461 --> 18:54.006
# My blanket covers me #

18:54.133 --> 18:55.800
# Yeah #

18:55.926 --> 18:56.884
# Check it #

18:57.010 --> 18:58.970
# Now, as a youth, man,
I was body poppin' #

18:59.096 --> 19:00.555
# breakin' on the lino #

19:00.681 --> 19:03.975
# Traded in my lino for a pad
and a biro #

19:04.101 --> 19:07.145
# Used to stand in line
so as I can sign my giro #

19:07.271 --> 19:11.858
# But now my ends are meeting
in the best way that I know #

19:11.984 --> 19:13.442
# And the beats that go boom #

19:13.569 --> 19:16.821
# See the music I consume
to escape the doom and gloom #

19:16.947 --> 19:18.322
# All the beats and melodies #

19:18.448 --> 19:20.408
# that keep realities at bay #

19:20.534 --> 19:22.034
# But what happen
when the record's done #

19:22.161 --> 19:24.203
# and start to fade away,
fade away #

19:24.329 --> 19:30.710
# Alone within myself again #

19:30.836 --> 19:37.758
# I try to veil away my pain #

19:37.885 --> 19:40.261
# The dirty grey #

19:40.387 --> 19:42.346
# surrounding me 'round #

19:42.472 --> 19:46.267
# And now I hear no sounds #

20:29.895 --> 20:31.187
Doctor, what is it?

20:31.313 --> 20:35.691
Jack, you have gastric cancer.

20:35.817 --> 20:37.485
How much time do I have?

20:37.611 --> 20:41.280
It depends
on your will to live.

20:41.406 --> 20:44.033
Yo, excuse me.

20:44.159 --> 20:45.409
Calm down, man.

20:45.535 --> 20:47.411
This is my last stop.

20:47.537 --> 20:50.122
And your nose is bleeding.

20:58.215 --> 20:59.715
Okay, well,

20:59.841 --> 21:03.302
after carefully reviewing
your application, Mr. Doolittle,

21:03.428 --> 21:04.637
I regret to inform you

21:04.763 --> 21:08.391
that we have denied your
request for a loan at this time.

21:08.517 --> 21:11.227
But I filled everything out
just like you requested.

21:11.353 --> 21:12.895
Yes.

21:13.021 --> 21:15.982
When your father passed away,
he left a lot of debt.

21:16.108 --> 21:18.859
I'm afraid, without
a substantial payment,

21:18.986 --> 21:21.821
we have no choice but to begin
foreclosure proceedings

21:21.947 --> 21:23.322
at the end of the month.

21:25.575 --> 21:27.493
Hello, Mrs. Wilson?

21:27.619 --> 21:29.620
Hey, this-this is Qwerty
from the mortuary.

21:29.746 --> 21:30.913
Why are you calling?

21:31.039 --> 21:32.164
No, I-I was wondering-

21:32.291 --> 21:34.333
I know I promised no payments
till after New Year,

21:34.459 --> 21:35.418
but I was just wondering if-

21:35.544 --> 21:37.545
if there was anything you can
offer in the next few days,

21:37.671 --> 21:39.463
that would-that would be
hugely appreciated.

21:39.589 --> 21:41.424
Richard got laid off.

21:41.550 --> 21:42.717
It's Christmas,

21:42.843 --> 21:44.510
and I haven't gotten
the children anything yet.

21:44.636 --> 21:45.636
I don't think-

21:45.762 --> 21:47.221
All right, no, you know what?

21:47.347 --> 21:48.681
Forget the call.
Forget the call.

21:48.807 --> 21:49.765
You keep the money,

21:49.891 --> 21:50.850
and you buy your kids
some gifts.

21:50.976 --> 21:52.184
You make it a good Christmas
for 'em.

21:52.311 --> 21:53.311
Thank you, Qwerty.

21:53.437 --> 21:54.603
Your father would be proud.

21:54.730 --> 21:55.688
All right, no.

21:55.814 --> 21:56.856
You're a fine young man.

21:56.982 --> 21:59.483
Yep, you have a good night,
Mrs. Wilson.

21:59.609 --> 22:00.651
All right.

22:13.248 --> 22:14.540
Oh, Christ, I'm sorry.

22:14.666 --> 22:16.917
You-you scared me.

22:17.044 --> 22:18.586
I was driving by,
I saw the lights in here,

22:18.712 --> 22:21.213
so I thought it was open.

22:21.340 --> 22:22.715
No, we're actually closed.

22:22.841 --> 22:25.968
We open at 10:00
in the morning.

22:26.094 --> 22:27.720
Okay.

22:32.017 --> 22:33.684
I need a coffin.

22:33.810 --> 22:38.230
I need it tonight.

22:38.357 --> 22:40.816
And I'll pay you cash for it.

22:50.952 --> 22:53.245
It's kind of-
it's peaceful in there, huh?

22:56.708 --> 22:57.708
What do you think?

23:01.880 --> 23:03.964
Sorry.

23:04.091 --> 23:05.591
I'll take it.

23:05.717 --> 23:06.717
All right, sir.

23:06.843 --> 23:08.928
It's a-it's a great choice.
You won't be disappointed.

23:09.054 --> 23:10.930
I have another request.

23:11.056 --> 23:13.349
Oh, we can customize it
with anything you want.

23:13.475 --> 23:15.309
In the past, we even put
a complete sound system

23:15.435 --> 23:16.685
with speakers in.

23:16.812 --> 23:18.979
No, no, this-this is-

23:19.106 --> 23:23.776
No, no, I like the coffin.

23:23.902 --> 23:25.486
It's just that it needs a body.

23:25.612 --> 23:28.656
Oh, we're a full service
mortuary, sir.

23:28.782 --> 23:30.491
Has-has the deceased
been embalmed yet?

23:30.617 --> 23:32.326
No, he's-he's not dead yet.

23:34.496 --> 23:36.038
I'm sorry,
I don't understand.

23:38.875 --> 23:40.000
Sir, please-

23:42.087 --> 23:47.508
Please, I don't want
any trouble.

23:47.634 --> 23:50.386
I know this is
an unusual request,

23:50.512 --> 23:55.307
but I need you to take this gun

23:55.434 --> 23:58.227
and put a bullet
inside my heart.

23:58.353 --> 23:59.979
No, perhaps
you've been drinking.

24:00.105 --> 24:02.773
Please, everything is-

24:02.899 --> 24:04.358
everything's gonna be all right.

24:04.484 --> 24:05.651
I can pay you.
- No.

24:05.777 --> 24:09.113
I got $50,000 cash.

24:09.239 --> 24:11.449
What, you don't believe me?

24:11.575 --> 24:12.533
I'll show you.

24:12.659 --> 24:13.826
I'll show you;
it's in my car.

24:18.373 --> 24:19.665
This can't be happening.

24:19.791 --> 24:20.916
It could all be yours.

24:21.042 --> 24:23.669
I know you have problems.

24:23.795 --> 24:26.255
I heard you on the phone.

24:26.381 --> 24:30.050
We all have problems.

24:30.177 --> 24:33.387
You help-you help me with mine,
I help you with yours.

24:46.359 --> 24:47.693
No, keep it.

24:47.819 --> 24:49.737
Please, please.
Please, sir.

24:49.863 --> 24:52.865
Sir, in my-in my profession,
I see death every day,

24:52.991 --> 24:54.825
some by accident,
some by sickness,

24:54.951 --> 24:57.703
but some through despair.

24:57.829 --> 25:00.206
These are the ones
I wish I could have helped.

25:00.332 --> 25:02.041
Help me.

25:02.167 --> 25:05.127
Help me by pulling this trigger.

25:05.253 --> 25:06.670
Please.

25:06.796 --> 25:08.255
Come on, please.

25:08.381 --> 25:10.424
Please, I need your help.

25:10.550 --> 25:11.884
No.
- Please.

25:12.010 --> 25:13.886
Go ahead.
- I won't do it.

25:14.012 --> 25:16.722
I won't kill you.
No.

25:16.848 --> 25:19.225
Why?

25:19.351 --> 25:21.393
It's easy!

25:34.241 --> 25:38.827
I and my father are one?

25:38.954 --> 25:41.247
But can you feel my pain?

25:41.373 --> 25:45.209
Can you feel my pain?

25:47.796 --> 25:49.463
Hi. Hey.

25:49.589 --> 25:50.881
Hey.

25:51.007 --> 25:53.259
How's it feel to be my husband?

25:53.385 --> 25:56.387
Today, I must say that I'm
the happiest man in the world.

26:04.938 --> 26:07.523
Let me show you.

26:07.649 --> 26:11.151
Let me show the kids.

26:11.278 --> 26:14.738
Hey.

26:14.864 --> 26:16.490
I love you.

26:16.616 --> 26:18.576
I love you too.

26:27.627 --> 26:30.087
Charlie?

26:30.213 --> 26:33.591
Sorry to wake you, but we're-
we're closing down soon.

26:41.099 --> 26:42.057
Here.

26:42.183 --> 26:44.268
It's on the house.

26:44.394 --> 26:46.562
Just hope it might
cheer you up.

26:46.688 --> 26:48.147
You have a few minutes, so...

26:48.273 --> 26:51.150
or I could pack it up
to go for you.

26:51.276 --> 26:52.234
You want to share it?

26:52.360 --> 26:54.153
Share it with me?

26:54.279 --> 26:57.531
Oh.

26:57.657 --> 27:03.329
It's tempting, but I have this
new dress for the holiday

27:03.455 --> 27:05.372
that I'm determined to fit in.

27:05.498 --> 27:08.500
Want to know my secret?

27:08.627 --> 27:11.754
I hang it over the dining table
to help motivate me a bit.

27:16.635 --> 27:17.760
It's good, huh?

27:17.886 --> 27:18.844
Isn't it?

27:18.970 --> 27:21.930
We bake 'em fresh here
every morning.

27:22.057 --> 27:23.974
I think they're good.

27:27.771 --> 27:29.229
I don't mean to be nosy
or anything,

27:29.356 --> 27:33.400
but what's a man like you
doing at this hour

27:33.526 --> 27:37.529
passed out in a diner?

27:37.656 --> 27:40.616
I had a really hard day.

27:40.742 --> 27:44.244
Big smile like yours,
you expect me to believe that?

27:54.005 --> 27:55.839
Yeah, just right here.

27:55.965 --> 27:58.300
Okay.

27:58.426 --> 28:00.511
Yeah, just right up there.

28:12.607 --> 28:13.691
I like the lights.

28:13.817 --> 28:15.526
I did it myself.

28:15.652 --> 28:17.695
Yeah?

28:19.489 --> 28:21.115
I like the different colors.

28:21.241 --> 28:23.033
Yeah.

28:23.159 --> 28:25.327
Yeah, I've always
loved Christmas.

28:30.041 --> 28:31.792
You live there a long time?

28:31.918 --> 28:34.795
About a year,
since my divorce.

28:36.715 --> 28:38.006
You don't really
have to talk about that

28:38.133 --> 28:39.091
if you don't feel like it.

28:39.217 --> 28:40.217
I don't-

28:40.343 --> 28:43.262
Well, we-
you know, we grew apart.

28:43.388 --> 28:45.597
You know, you wake up
one morning after 13 years,

28:45.724 --> 28:47.474
and the feeling's gone,

28:47.600 --> 28:49.017
and, you know,
you try to hang in there,

28:49.144 --> 28:52.271
but there's really nothing
you can do.

28:52.397 --> 28:54.356
But we both agreed that,
you know,

28:54.482 --> 28:58.777
we didn't want to grow old
taking up each other's space.

28:58.903 --> 29:01.155
You guys still talk, then?

29:01.281 --> 29:02.823
Not for a couple months.

29:07.495 --> 29:08.954
Do you-

29:09.080 --> 29:11.373
do you want to come up,
'cause I'm just-

29:11.499 --> 29:14.460
I live there alone,
and I don't have any cats,

29:14.586 --> 29:17.045
in case your allergic.

29:18.423 --> 29:20.299
I, um...

29:20.425 --> 29:22.718
I don't- I don't think
I should do that.

29:22.844 --> 29:24.720
No, you're probably right.

29:24.846 --> 29:26.138
It's late.

29:26.264 --> 29:29.516
I mean, you're probably
really tired anyway.

29:29.642 --> 29:31.143
Can I ask you something?

29:31.269 --> 29:35.022
How come you picked me up,
gave me a ride?

29:35.148 --> 29:36.732
I don't know.

29:36.858 --> 29:38.817
I don't-I don't know why.

29:38.943 --> 29:40.360
I don't know.

29:48.953 --> 29:50.204
Okay, I hope you don't mind.

29:50.330 --> 29:51.580
I just haven't-

29:51.706 --> 29:56.543
I just, you know, haven't kissed
a man in a long time.

29:56.669 --> 30:00.756
I just forgot how good it feels.

30:00.882 --> 30:02.508
Okay, thank you for the ride.

30:02.634 --> 30:04.343
Maybe I'll see you around.

30:04.469 --> 30:05.594
Okay.

30:23.947 --> 30:26.990
Yeah!
- Whoo!

30:34.499 --> 30:38.335
Hey, you're late again.

30:38.461 --> 30:39.503
Get down there and get dressed

30:39.629 --> 30:41.255
and get on
the fucking stage now.

30:53.101 --> 30:55.394
We need to talk now.

30:56.604 --> 30:58.730
Well, lookie, lookie, Cookie.

30:58.857 --> 30:59.982
No, don't stop.

31:00.108 --> 31:02.985
It just got
a lot more interesting.

31:03.111 --> 31:05.153
So come on
and join the party, sweetcakes.

31:05.280 --> 31:09.700
We are on lesson number three,
the day you were absent.

31:11.244 --> 31:13.203
Oh, no, you did not
touch the 'do.

31:13.329 --> 31:14.288
Oh, yeah.

31:14.414 --> 31:15.956
Fuck your 'do,
and fuck your whores.

31:16.082 --> 31:17.416
Who you calling a whore,
you little bitch?

31:17.542 --> 31:18.500
I don't see what else-

31:18.626 --> 31:22.129
No, no, no,
Cookie, Cookie, Cookie.

31:22.255 --> 31:23.338
Go upstairs.

31:23.464 --> 31:25.215
We'll finish up later.

31:30.346 --> 31:32.890
All right.

31:33.016 --> 31:35.893
So...

31:36.019 --> 31:38.604
What are we talking about here,
Johnny?

31:38.730 --> 31:39.771
I don't understand.
Tell me-

31:39.898 --> 31:40.856
We're talking about my son.

31:40.982 --> 31:42.149
We're talking about my son.

31:42.275 --> 31:43.859
I cannot work on Christmas Eve.

31:43.985 --> 31:45.110
I have to be with him.

31:45.236 --> 31:46.737
Your son needs you to work,

31:46.863 --> 31:48.280
and he needs you to work
very hard.

31:48.406 --> 31:50.657
Don't you fucking tell me
what's best for my kid.

31:50.783 --> 31:51.825
I swear to God.

31:51.951 --> 31:54.036
The kid would not
know the difference

31:54.162 --> 31:56.538
whether you're there or not.

31:56.664 --> 31:57.998
Goddamn it.

31:58.124 --> 32:02.336
Johnny, I have been easy on you,

32:02.462 --> 32:04.129
because when I watch you dance,

32:04.255 --> 32:08.800
I get a raging boner,
and so do a lot of other people.

32:08.927 --> 32:10.469
But on Christmas Eve,

32:10.595 --> 32:15.807
I'm gonna have a lot of very
lonely people out in my club,

32:15.934 --> 32:19.645
some even thinking
about killing themselves,

32:19.771 --> 32:22.439
and they come here
looking for companionship.

32:22.565 --> 32:25.317
They're looking
for a little bit of love.

32:25.443 --> 32:27.152
They are looking
for a little bit of hope.

32:27.278 --> 32:29.321
What about- what about
one of the girls who's Jewish?

32:29.447 --> 32:30.781
What about them?
Why can't they work?

32:30.907 --> 32:32.741
That is not the point.

32:32.867 --> 32:34.826
All the dancing that goes on
on that stage

32:34.953 --> 32:37.204
is nothing but an expensive
advertisement

32:37.330 --> 32:41.249
for the main attraction
in the fucking blue room.

32:41.376 --> 32:43.293
Well, I am not a whore.

32:44.504 --> 32:47.381
Well, then you better learn,
Johnny,

32:47.507 --> 32:50.842
'cause you are costing me
$1,000 a head

32:50.969 --> 32:53.762
every time you don't give any.

32:53.888 --> 32:55.847
Let me put it this way.

32:55.974 --> 32:59.017
If you are not here
on Christmas Eve,

32:59.143 --> 33:03.397
you should consider getting
a job at Wally's Whack Shack.

33:03.523 --> 33:05.357
We clear?

33:05.483 --> 33:06.525
Yeah.

33:38.599 --> 33:40.559
You all right?

33:40.685 --> 33:43.937
Everything all right?

33:44.063 --> 33:46.815
Just leave me alone.

33:46.941 --> 33:48.066
It's getting colder.

33:48.192 --> 33:51.028
You're gonna get sick
dressed like that.

33:51.154 --> 33:54.698
Why don't you just fuck off?

33:54.824 --> 33:56.241
Listen, I'm not gonna
go back in

33:56.367 --> 33:59.036
until I know you're all right.

33:59.162 --> 34:00.245
You don't have to rush.

34:00.371 --> 34:01.913
Just take your time.

34:08.045 --> 34:10.797
Do you have a smoke?

34:10.922 --> 34:13.050
Yeah, sure.

34:21.016 --> 34:22.141
You're not from around here,
are you?

34:22.268 --> 34:25.270
No, I'm just passing through.

34:29.317 --> 34:31.193
Yeah, I thought so.

34:31.319 --> 34:32.777
You're too nice.

34:37.533 --> 34:39.951
Thanks.

34:40.078 --> 34:42.329
Where are you from?

34:42.455 --> 34:43.746
San Francisco.

34:43.873 --> 34:45.415
Moved down here
about a year ago.

34:47.668 --> 34:49.628
What's your name?

34:49.754 --> 34:50.754
Scarlet.

34:51.714 --> 34:53.507
Scarlet.

34:53.632 --> 34:54.882
I'm Jack.

34:57.804 --> 34:59.137
Were you in here
the other night?

34:59.347 --> 35:01.056
No.

35:01.182 --> 35:04.559
You sure?

35:04.685 --> 35:06.436
'Cause I don't forget eyes
like yours.

35:07.522 --> 35:09.439
I'm sure.

35:09.565 --> 35:10.690
Get dressed.

35:10.817 --> 35:11.983
You got a request
for a private.

35:16.781 --> 35:18.824
Whoa.

35:18.950 --> 35:21.326
I got to go.

35:21.452 --> 35:23.245
Can I see you again?

35:23.371 --> 35:24.371
Yeah, yeah.

35:24.497 --> 35:26.373
Just request me, Scarlet.

35:26.499 --> 35:27.707
Wait for me in the blue room.

35:34.006 --> 35:35.006
Here.

35:35.133 --> 35:39.010
Oh.
- Thanks.

35:39.137 --> 35:40.846
Okay.

35:53.985 --> 35:55.861
Hey, papa.

35:55.987 --> 35:58.655
I hope I didn't keep you
too long.

35:58.781 --> 36:01.241
I'll make it up to you.

36:01.367 --> 36:04.327
First one's on me.

36:20.970 --> 36:22.262
This is your first time,
isn't it?

36:22.388 --> 36:24.514
Yeah, let's-

36:24.640 --> 36:26.391
why don't we just talk first?

36:26.517 --> 36:29.102
Most men don't pay me to talk.

36:29.228 --> 36:32.105
And the ones who do are trying
to talk me into something else.

36:32.231 --> 36:34.941
But I'm telling you,
I don't do anything but dance.

36:35.067 --> 36:36.526
I don't want anything.

36:36.652 --> 36:39.029
Let's just talk like
we were doing before.

36:49.916 --> 36:53.043
Come dance with me.

36:53.169 --> 36:54.336
Here?
No.

36:54.462 --> 36:56.796
No, I-I'm not good at that.

36:56.923 --> 36:58.215
Yes, it will be fun.

36:58.341 --> 37:00.091
I got old legs.

37:00.218 --> 37:04.137
They might be old,
but they're not dead.

37:04.263 --> 37:07.432
And it's a slow song.

38:00.486 --> 38:02.612
Just stop.

38:05.116 --> 38:07.450
Are you afraid of me?

38:07.576 --> 38:09.744
I'm old enough
to be your father.

38:09.870 --> 38:13.164
Most of them are.

38:20.464 --> 38:22.465
No, stop.

38:31.142 --> 38:36.187
Oh, sweet pea,
Mommy misses you so much.

38:39.150 --> 38:42.110
I just don't know
how much longer I can do this.

38:42.236 --> 38:45.071
I'm trying for you, baby.

38:46.824 --> 38:49.534
I miss you so much.

38:49.660 --> 38:52.620
I just feel like it's my fault.

39:15.895 --> 39:18.271
Arctic storms moving
into Northern California

39:18.397 --> 39:20.565
should cause temperatures
in the L.A. basin

39:20.691 --> 39:23.318
to drop as much as 25 degrees.

39:23.444 --> 39:25.445
Although temperatures have been
within normal ranges

39:25.571 --> 39:26.863
for this holiday season,

39:26.989 --> 39:28.907
these temps are highly unusual.

39:44.882 --> 39:46.174
Come on, Lucky.

39:46.300 --> 39:47.884
Come on.

39:49.929 --> 39:51.221
Come on.

39:55.643 --> 39:58.228
Come on, Lucky.

40:29.802 --> 40:31.594
Excuse me, miss,
may I check your purse?

40:31.720 --> 40:32.679
No, you may not.

40:32.805 --> 40:34.139
I'm not asking
for your permission.

40:34.265 --> 40:35.557
Are you accusing me
of something?

40:35.683 --> 40:37.934
Say, sweetie, there you are.

40:38.060 --> 40:39.978
I was looking for you.

40:40.104 --> 40:41.521
Is everything okay?
- Store security.

40:41.647 --> 40:43.022
I need to check her purse.

40:43.149 --> 40:44.941
Oh, you know what?

40:45.067 --> 40:46.401
This is my fault.

40:46.527 --> 40:48.069
It's a collector's edition,

40:48.195 --> 40:49.904
and I told her
that I paid for it already,

40:50.030 --> 40:53.199
but I got sidetracked.

40:53.325 --> 40:56.453
Can-can we just let this slide?

40:59.999 --> 41:00.999
Hey.

41:01.125 --> 41:02.667
Hey, hey, hey.

41:02.793 --> 41:04.419
Get your hands off me!

41:04.545 --> 41:06.838
All right.

41:06.964 --> 41:09.007
Here.

41:11.469 --> 41:13.303
Must be for someone special,
huh?

41:20.144 --> 41:21.561
Why are you following me?

41:22.980 --> 41:27.358
I just-
let me buy you some lunch, okay?

41:27.485 --> 41:30.361
Your choice.

41:30.488 --> 41:31.571
I just want to talk.

41:43.042 --> 41:45.960
There you go.

41:46.086 --> 41:49.339
Well, you're just filled
with little tricks, aren't you?

41:49.465 --> 41:51.049
Here's your dessert.

41:51.175 --> 41:53.218
Thanks.
- Enjoy.

41:53.344 --> 41:55.136
So what brings you
to this city?

41:55.262 --> 42:00.016
Well, what brings anyone
to this city?

42:00.142 --> 42:02.060
I wanted to be a somebody.

42:02.186 --> 42:03.645
Is that so much to ask?

42:04.522 --> 42:05.939
You sound like a nonbeliever.

42:06.065 --> 42:07.732
No, this city just has a way

42:07.858 --> 42:10.485
of crushing your dreams
pretty fast.

42:12.154 --> 42:13.238
Well, what about your parents.

42:13.364 --> 42:15.448
Were they for it?

42:21.205 --> 42:24.249
My mother just recently
passed away,

42:24.375 --> 42:27.585
and my father died
in a boating accident

42:27.711 --> 42:30.797
before I was born.

42:30.923 --> 42:33.258
That's what she told me, anyway.

42:33.384 --> 42:35.301
You have doubts?

42:35.427 --> 42:39.806
I don't know.

42:39.932 --> 42:45.103
I used to catch her staring off
into somewhere for hours,

42:45.229 --> 42:49.107
like she knows
that he's still around.

42:53.571 --> 42:54.946
Can I tell you a secret?

42:55.072 --> 42:58.908
Yeah, sure.

42:59.034 --> 43:01.327
I see my father all the time.

43:02.663 --> 43:03.955
How?

43:04.081 --> 43:10.295
In my sleep,
especially when I was younger.

43:10.421 --> 43:12.338
See, he likes to travel
the world,

43:12.464 --> 43:14.841
and if I'm good,

43:14.967 --> 43:17.969
then sometimes
he'll take me with him

43:18.095 --> 43:20.638
and share his adventures
with me.

43:20.764 --> 43:21.931
And what's he like?

43:22.057 --> 43:26.352
He's handsome,
and he has strong hands

43:26.478 --> 43:28.229
and a very gentle heart.

43:28.355 --> 43:30.773
I mean, he couldn't hurt a fly
if he wanted to.

43:34.612 --> 43:37.363
And he has eyes like yours,

43:37.489 --> 43:41.618
all mysterious
and full of secrets.

43:45.289 --> 43:48.249
I'm sorry, I don't mean
to make you feel uncomfortable.

43:49.501 --> 43:51.502
It's okay.
Don't apologize.

43:51.629 --> 43:54.005
I just really like
talking to you.

43:54.131 --> 43:57.383
I really like talking
to you too.

44:03.390 --> 44:05.683
You know what time it is?

44:05.809 --> 44:06.893
I don't have a watch-

44:07.019 --> 44:08.895
I got to go.
I'm late for work.

44:09.021 --> 44:11.356
I can't afford
to lose another job.

44:11.482 --> 44:12.649
You'll come in and see me?

44:12.775 --> 44:14.359
Yeah.

44:14.485 --> 44:16.194
All right.

44:16.320 --> 44:18.446
Thanks.

44:18.572 --> 44:19.989
Don't stop believing.

44:21.450 --> 44:22.742
Only in miracles, Jack.

45:04.952 --> 45:05.952
Hi.
- Hey.

45:06.078 --> 45:07.829
I'm Nicole.

45:07.955 --> 45:09.205
Hey.

45:09.331 --> 45:11.040
I'm-my name's Qwerty.

45:11.166 --> 45:12.125
I know.

45:12.251 --> 45:14.502
It's on your name tag.

45:15.546 --> 45:17.880
Is this your first time?

45:18.006 --> 45:19.507
Yeah.

45:19.633 --> 45:20.883
Is it that obvious?

45:21.009 --> 45:22.218
It's also my first time.

45:22.344 --> 45:25.430
You know, at first,
I didn't really want to come.

45:25.556 --> 45:27.265
I didn't want
to seem desperate,

45:27.391 --> 45:29.642
like I need help
in meeting someone.

45:29.768 --> 45:35.189
But then I realized I haven't
been on a date in-in two years.

45:35.315 --> 45:38.067
So, here I am.

45:39.069 --> 45:40.945
Are-are you coming inside?

45:41.071 --> 45:45.825
Yeah, of course,
of course.

45:45.951 --> 45:46.951
Is everything all right?

45:47.077 --> 45:49.787
I'm sorry; I think
I'm losing circulation.

45:49.913 --> 45:51.164
Where?

45:51.290 --> 45:52.749
Just here in my right leg.

45:52.875 --> 45:54.208
Can I get you some water
or something?

45:54.334 --> 45:55.918
Are you-

46:00.758 --> 46:02.008
Help!

46:30.788 --> 46:32.789
Hi.

46:32.915 --> 46:36.459
Hey.

46:36.585 --> 46:39.545
I haven't seen you around
in a few days.

46:44.635 --> 46:46.928
I was such an idiot
the other night.

46:47.054 --> 46:49.347
I don't know
what came over me,

46:49.473 --> 46:52.809
but I apologize
if I was being too forward.

46:54.144 --> 46:56.813
It's been a very long time
for me too.

47:06.782 --> 47:08.157
You finished?
You're off?

47:08.283 --> 47:11.285
Yeah, it's been slow.

47:12.496 --> 47:15.873
If-if you want some company,
I could-

47:15.999 --> 47:19.460
If you-if you'd like,
I could take you home.

47:19.586 --> 47:20.628
I mean, if you want,
I could-

47:20.754 --> 47:22.088
Yeah, no, I-
yeah, I would like that.

47:22.214 --> 47:23.214
I would.

47:23.340 --> 47:25.883
Great.

47:29.638 --> 47:30.596
But not tonight.

47:30.722 --> 47:32.390
I can't.

47:32.516 --> 47:33.766
That's him.

47:33.892 --> 47:37.812
He called, you know, right-
shortly after I got home.

47:37.938 --> 47:41.566
And he wants to talk,
and so here he is.

47:44.820 --> 47:46.737
All right, well, bye.

47:46.864 --> 47:48.948
Mm, bye.

49:37.808 --> 49:38.766
Some friends of yours,

49:38.892 --> 49:41.268
they told me
that you could help me.

49:41.395 --> 49:43.479
I'm looking for a girl.

49:43.605 --> 49:44.563
I don't know her name.

49:44.690 --> 49:46.565
I met her the other night.

49:46.692 --> 49:49.735
She-she has
really big blonde hair.

49:49.861 --> 49:54.907
She was wearing a red dress
with-with these all on it.

50:03.917 --> 50:05.376
I could-I could pay you
for your time

50:05.502 --> 50:07.420
if you help me find her.

50:14.845 --> 50:16.971
Well, I ain't seen her
all night,

50:17.097 --> 50:20.558
but if they found her dead,
I wouldn't be surprised.

50:20.684 --> 50:22.184
What do you mean by that?

50:22.310 --> 50:26.022
That señorita tried to execute
her life twice, man.

50:26.148 --> 50:28.441
She slit both her wrists.

50:28.567 --> 50:31.569
The crazy girl want to make
a baby inside of her.

50:31.695 --> 50:35.072
It like the ultimate
transformation and shit.

50:35.198 --> 50:39.660
She even fake a miscarriage,
you get me, man?

50:39.786 --> 50:40.870
How do you know this?

50:40.996 --> 50:43.164
I'm her doctor.

50:43.290 --> 50:45.166
She tell me all her symptoms,
you know, man.

50:45.292 --> 50:48.669
And I prescribe her medication,
make her feel good.

50:51.423 --> 50:53.299
Listen, man,
if she ain't on the streets,

50:53.425 --> 50:54.925
I can't tell you.

50:55.052 --> 50:58.220
If she ain't dead,
she be out here on Friday night

50:58.346 --> 50:59.847
or at the Geisha Dungeon.

50:59.973 --> 51:02.600
Geisha Dungeon, what's that?

51:02.726 --> 51:04.602
The devil's lair.

51:24.247 --> 51:26.916
Hey.

51:27.042 --> 51:29.543
Hello.
- Hi.

51:29.669 --> 51:32.004
I was hoping
you would come in.

51:32.130 --> 51:33.881
I saw you in my dreams
last night.

51:34.007 --> 51:37.468
Yeah, I wasn't sure
you were gonna be here.

51:37.594 --> 51:39.345
Can you come closer?

51:39.471 --> 51:41.972
I'd like to get a good look
at your face.

51:42.099 --> 51:43.265
Okay.

51:47.062 --> 51:49.897
It was strange.

51:50.023 --> 51:51.774
You were running.

51:51.900 --> 51:54.819
You were running from something.

51:54.945 --> 51:56.987
Maybe I was trying to run
to something

51:57.114 --> 51:59.156
or someone.

51:59.282 --> 52:00.658
No.

52:00.784 --> 52:05.329
You had fear in your eyes
like you do now.

52:05.455 --> 52:07.498
I, um...

52:07.624 --> 52:10.334
I was thinking about
what you said yesterday,

52:10.460 --> 52:12.044
you know, that stuff
with your father

52:12.170 --> 52:16.298
taking you to places
that you've never been.

52:16.424 --> 52:18.008
Well, guess what?

52:18.135 --> 52:20.010
What?

52:20.137 --> 52:27.143
I got you two tickets
to anyplace in the world.

52:33.817 --> 52:35.943
I don't know what to say.

52:36.069 --> 52:38.195
Say, "I accept."

52:41.199 --> 52:43.325
No, I can't.

52:43.451 --> 52:44.535
We barely even know each other.

52:44.661 --> 52:47.955
Listen.

52:48.081 --> 52:49.665
I don't have
a lot of time left.

52:49.791 --> 52:51.333
I don't watch the clock
in here, Jack.

52:51.459 --> 52:52.793
You can have me
for as long as you want.

52:52.919 --> 52:55.838
What I'm saying is,
I'm going away soon,

52:55.964 --> 52:59.049
and I'm not gonna be
coming back.

52:59.176 --> 53:01.719
I want you
to have these tickets.

53:01.845 --> 53:03.345
It would mean a lot to me.

53:06.516 --> 53:08.392
Who are you?

53:08.518 --> 53:10.352
Why are you so good to me?

53:15.400 --> 53:17.985
My name's Jack Doheny.

53:18.111 --> 53:20.279
I've been locked away
for 25 years,

53:20.405 --> 53:21.739
which is a hell of a lot of time

53:21.865 --> 53:23.949
for a man to reflect
on his life,

53:24.075 --> 53:25.618
the choices he made

53:25.744 --> 53:28.704
and what he wants to do
if given a second chance.

53:31.666 --> 53:34.919
For 25 years,

53:35.045 --> 53:40.216
I waited for my love
to come visit me.

53:41.218 --> 53:44.386
But that day never came.

53:45.889 --> 53:50.309
And then I got the news
that she passed away.

53:53.605 --> 53:57.733
I never got the chance to-
to tell her I was sorry.

53:59.819 --> 54:03.989
I loved her more than anything.

54:04.115 --> 54:09.662
I'll never forget the day
that I first laid eyes upon her.

54:09.788 --> 54:12.122
Her smile was beautiful.

54:12.249 --> 54:15.542
She was so graceful.

54:15.669 --> 54:20.965
When I saw her the next day...

54:21.091 --> 54:26.595
I dumped a truckload of roses
at her feet...

54:26.721 --> 54:29.640
and I told her
that if it wasn't enough,

54:29.766 --> 54:31.475
I'd come back the next day

54:31.601 --> 54:34.353
with roses
from all over the world.

54:35.981 --> 54:39.984
We had dinner that night,

54:40.110 --> 54:42.820
and by morning...

54:42.946 --> 54:45.197
she became my wife.

54:47.784 --> 54:49.034
No.

54:49.160 --> 54:52.871
I don't know what you're trying
to tell me

54:52.998 --> 54:54.581
or who you are

54:54.708 --> 54:56.166
or who put you up to this,

54:56.293 --> 54:59.503
but you have some nerve
coming in here.

54:59.629 --> 55:01.839
You are a sick son of a bitch,

55:01.965 --> 55:04.633
and I want you
to get out of here now.

55:04.759 --> 55:06.760
I want you to leave now.

55:06.886 --> 55:08.846
Get the fuck out of here!

55:08.972 --> 55:10.431
What are you looking at?

55:10.557 --> 55:11.515
Don't look at me.

55:11.641 --> 55:13.142
Get out of here.

55:13.268 --> 55:15.311
Get the fuck out of here!

55:15.437 --> 55:16.562
No, wait, wait, don't!

55:30.660 --> 55:33.245
Don't come back.

55:39.961 --> 55:41.879
Someone please answer me.

55:42.005 --> 55:43.672
Someone please-

55:43.798 --> 55:45.841
Somebody please answer me now.

55:45.967 --> 55:48.010
I need you.
I need you right now.

55:54.684 --> 55:55.642
Excuse me.

55:55.769 --> 55:57.728
Ma'am, visiting hours are over.

55:57.854 --> 56:00.064
Ma'am, you can't go in there.

56:00.190 --> 56:02.232
Ma'am.

56:02.359 --> 56:03.567
Is he all right?

56:03.693 --> 56:05.235
Why wasn't anyone here
when I called?

56:05.362 --> 56:07.112
Everything is fine.

56:07.238 --> 56:09.198
The other nurse waited.
You didn't call.

56:09.324 --> 56:10.491
Her shift is over now.

56:10.617 --> 56:11.700
What is wrong with you people?

56:11.826 --> 56:14.119
This is my son.

56:14.245 --> 56:16.747
He's dying,
don't you understand?

56:16.873 --> 56:21.210
This is my son,
and he's dying.

56:21.336 --> 56:22.336
All right.

56:22.462 --> 56:26.048
Just please keep it down.

56:31.721 --> 56:34.431
How you doing, sweet pea?

56:34.557 --> 56:37.393
Oh, you scared me tonight.

56:37.519 --> 56:39.019
Mommy called,
and nobody answered,

56:39.145 --> 56:42.815
and I thought
something happened to you.

56:42.941 --> 56:44.733
I thought you had left me.

56:49.572 --> 56:52.241
I got something for you.

56:56.246 --> 56:59.665
I know you're gonna like it.

56:59.791 --> 57:02.167
It's a special edition.

57:02.293 --> 57:04.753
Why don't you open your eyes
so you can see it?

57:10.051 --> 57:13.178
You are gonna be all right.

57:13.304 --> 57:16.640
I'm not gonna let
anything happen to you.

57:16.766 --> 57:19.476
I promise you.

57:19.602 --> 57:22.312
I promise you, sweet pea.

57:22.439 --> 57:24.690
I just miss you so much.

57:27.694 --> 57:30.237
Baby?

57:30.363 --> 57:31.989
Baby?

57:32.115 --> 57:35.033
Baby, are you awake?

57:35.160 --> 57:36.827
Nurse!

57:36.953 --> 57:39.913
Nurse!
Doctor!

57:44.210 --> 57:45.669
Sit down for a minute,
Johnny.

57:45.795 --> 57:46.837
I don't want to sit.

57:46.963 --> 57:48.338
I don't want to sit.

57:52.552 --> 57:54.803
Please put it out
and have a seat.

58:01.978 --> 58:04.229
Have some coffee.

58:06.691 --> 58:08.317
Johnny, your boy
is in what's known-

58:08.443 --> 58:10.110
Billy.

58:10.236 --> 58:11.862
His name is Billy.

58:11.988 --> 58:14.490
Yes, Billy.

58:14.616 --> 58:16.783
I need to remind you that
for the last three months,

58:16.910 --> 58:19.661
he's in what's known as
a persistent vegetative state.

58:19.787 --> 58:21.288
He blinked.

58:21.414 --> 58:23.749
I saw it with my own eyes.

58:23.875 --> 58:26.043
While I was talking to him,
he blinked.

58:26.169 --> 58:28.003
That's misleading, and it's a-

58:28.129 --> 58:32.549
it's a common involuntary reflex
response to motion and sound.

58:32.675 --> 58:34.801
Do you believe in miracles?

58:34.928 --> 58:35.886
In my profession,

58:36.012 --> 58:38.388
sometimes I have no choice
but to.

58:38.515 --> 58:41.683
Well, maybe this is
one of those times.

58:41.809 --> 58:43.769
I saw him blink.

58:43.895 --> 58:47.397
I saw it with my own eyes.

58:47.524 --> 58:50.442
There's not much else
I can do.

58:52.445 --> 58:54.196
I'm sorry, Johnny.

59:00.203 --> 59:02.162
Well, fuck you.

59:02.288 --> 59:03.247
You're a doctor...

59:03.373 --> 59:04.373
Calm down.

59:04.499 --> 59:05.791
And all you can say is,
"I'm sorry"?

59:05.917 --> 59:06.917
Calm down, Johnny.

59:07.043 --> 59:08.460
You're a trained professional.

59:08.586 --> 59:11.088
You are supposed to help people,
and my son needs help.

59:11.214 --> 59:12.422
He needs your help.

59:12.549 --> 59:14.841
You're all he's got.
Don't you understand that?

59:14.968 --> 59:16.760
Is it the money?

59:16.886 --> 59:18.053
You don't think
I have the money?

59:18.179 --> 59:20.430
Well, I will work
every day of my life.

59:20.557 --> 59:22.182
It's not the money.

59:25.144 --> 59:27.396
Then what is it?

59:34.279 --> 59:37.322
It's okay.

59:37.448 --> 59:40.158
I won't tell anyone.

59:44.414 --> 59:47.082
Is this what you want?

59:48.209 --> 59:49.501
Is this what you want?

59:49.627 --> 59:52.421
I'm sorry, Johnny.

59:52.547 --> 59:54.631
Where are you going?

59:54.757 --> 59:55.757
Please don't leave.

59:55.883 --> 59:59.469
I'll do whatever you want.

59:59.596 --> 01:00:00.721
Come back here!

01:00:00.847 --> 01:00:03.140
Doctors help people!

01:00:03.266 --> 01:00:05.225
You are not a doctor!

01:00:05.351 --> 01:00:06.810
You can't help anybody!

01:00:06.936 --> 01:00:08.729
You're a fucking shit!

01:00:46.517 --> 01:00:50.020
Dr. Alexander
call extension 2860.

01:00:51.272 --> 01:00:54.191
Dr. Alexander, 2860.

01:01:57.004 --> 01:01:58.922
What am I gonna do, Lucky?

01:01:59.048 --> 01:02:00.048
Hmm?

01:02:00.174 --> 01:02:02.426
What am I gonna do with you?

01:02:02.552 --> 01:02:05.053
I don't think I can
take care of you much longer.

01:02:13.479 --> 01:02:15.856
I got to get you back home.

01:02:17.358 --> 01:02:18.316
Don't look at me like that.

01:02:18.443 --> 01:02:20.110
Don't look at me like that.

01:02:20.236 --> 01:02:21.278
You don't even belong to me.

01:02:21.404 --> 01:02:23.822
Someone out there
is missing you right now.

01:02:23.948 --> 01:02:25.031
Wild Velvet.

01:02:25.158 --> 01:02:27.826
Hey, hey, is there
a Rose-Johnny there?

01:02:27.952 --> 01:02:29.119
Johnny who?

01:02:29.245 --> 01:02:30.287
A Rose-Johnny.

01:02:30.413 --> 01:02:31.371
You mean Scarlet.

01:02:31.497 --> 01:02:32.497
Hold on.

01:02:47.263 --> 01:02:48.263
Rudy!

01:02:48.389 --> 01:02:49.639
Hi.

01:02:49.766 --> 01:02:51.475
Oh, God.

01:02:51.601 --> 01:02:53.977
I missed you so much.

01:02:54.103 --> 01:02:55.979
Thank you so much
for finding him.

01:02:56.105 --> 01:02:57.522
I don't know
how I'll ever repay you.

01:02:57.648 --> 01:02:58.648
Oh, no, no, no, no.

01:02:58.775 --> 01:02:59.733
It was-it was my fault.

01:02:59.859 --> 01:03:02.027
I accidentally hit him
with my car.

01:03:02.153 --> 01:03:04.154
But he's all right now.

01:03:04.280 --> 01:03:05.781
Okay.

01:03:08.367 --> 01:03:09.743
Would you like to come in?

01:03:10.661 --> 01:03:11.661
Can I ask you something?

01:03:11.788 --> 01:03:14.998
Yeah, please, anything.

01:03:15.124 --> 01:03:17.167
I don't know how to put this.

01:03:17.293 --> 01:03:18.251
You know, just forget it.

01:03:18.377 --> 01:03:19.336
No, no, don't stop.

01:03:19.462 --> 01:03:21.880
You can-you can ask me
anything you want.

01:03:22.006 --> 01:03:24.341
Are you sure?
- Yeah.

01:03:26.803 --> 01:03:27.886
Can I use your bathroom?

01:03:28.012 --> 01:03:30.013
Yeah, of course.
It's across the hall.

01:03:43.736 --> 01:03:46.905
Oh, shit.

01:04:20.565 --> 01:04:22.524
Um, about the reward money...

01:04:22.650 --> 01:04:23.608
Oh, no, I don't-

01:04:23.734 --> 01:04:25.235
I can pay you next week,
I promise.

01:04:25.361 --> 01:04:26.778
No, it's okay.

01:04:31.534 --> 01:04:34.119
If you have any concerns,
I fed him three times a day.

01:04:34.245 --> 01:04:35.912
I walked him three times a day.

01:04:36.038 --> 01:04:37.080
I got him a toy in the back.

01:04:37.206 --> 01:04:40.542
You think I could just hold
your hands for a second?

01:04:43.796 --> 01:04:44.838
Yeah, sure.

01:04:55.016 --> 01:04:56.933
You're cold.

01:04:57.059 --> 01:04:59.185
That's you.

01:04:59.312 --> 01:05:01.438
And sweaty.

01:05:01.564 --> 01:05:04.065
Well, it's-it's hot in here.

01:05:07.737 --> 01:05:10.071
And they're soft.

01:05:10.197 --> 01:05:12.908
Yours too.

01:05:13.034 --> 01:05:16.036
You want to try something?

01:05:16.162 --> 01:05:17.996
I'm gonna count to three,

01:05:18.122 --> 01:05:20.457
and we're both gonna stand up,

01:05:20.583 --> 01:05:22.375
and we're gonna hug each other.

01:05:22.501 --> 01:05:23.793
Can you do that?
Do you mind?

01:05:23.920 --> 01:05:24.920
Can we do that?

01:05:28.424 --> 01:05:29.966
It was a stupid idea.

01:05:30.092 --> 01:05:31.718
Okay, I want to try it.

01:05:33.846 --> 01:05:36.640
I was hoping you'd say that.

01:05:36.766 --> 01:05:38.558
Are you ready?

01:05:38.684 --> 01:05:40.143
Yeah.

01:05:40.269 --> 01:05:41.978
Okay.

01:05:42.104 --> 01:05:45.231
One, two, three.

01:05:56.619 --> 01:05:59.079
That was nice, wasn't it?

01:05:59.205 --> 01:06:00.497
Yeah.

01:06:00.623 --> 01:06:02.332
It was nice.

01:06:02.458 --> 01:06:06.544
It was real nice.

01:06:06.671 --> 01:06:07.712
Can we do-
can we do it again?

01:06:07.838 --> 01:06:10.131
Okay.

01:06:48.838 --> 01:06:49.796
Well.

01:06:49.922 --> 01:06:50.964
I know what you're gonna say,

01:06:51.090 --> 01:06:52.173
that it's time for you to leave.

01:06:52.299 --> 01:06:53.550
But I don't-
I don't want you to go.

01:06:53.676 --> 01:06:55.427
I want you to stay.

01:06:55.553 --> 01:06:56.970
You sure?

01:06:57.096 --> 01:06:58.179
Yeah.

01:06:58.305 --> 01:06:59.264
You can stay here.

01:06:59.390 --> 01:07:00.598
I got-I got plenty of blankets.

01:07:00.725 --> 01:07:01.725
You can stay the night.

01:07:06.022 --> 01:07:08.273
I don't even know your name.

01:07:08.399 --> 01:07:11.985
Oh, it's Qwerty.

01:07:12.111 --> 01:07:14.738
Qwerty Doolittle.

01:07:14.864 --> 01:07:17.073
My name's Rose-Johnny.

01:07:17.199 --> 01:07:19.367
But everybody
just calls me Johnny.

01:07:21.787 --> 01:07:23.788
Well, it's nice
to meet you, Rose.

01:07:25.499 --> 01:07:28.376
Nice to meet you, Qwerty.

01:07:44.643 --> 01:07:47.020
You have to have a heart
that's open to God.

01:07:47.146 --> 01:07:49.481
Big change in our local
weather over the next few days.

01:07:49.607 --> 01:07:51.858
A low-pressure cold front
will be moving in

01:07:51.984 --> 01:07:53.568
during the next 24 hours

01:07:53.694 --> 01:07:56.571
as the jet stream heads south
into the gulf.

01:07:56.697 --> 01:07:59.407
These temperatures
will be highly unusual.

01:08:00.618 --> 01:08:02.494
Hello? Rose?

01:08:02.620 --> 01:08:05.330
Lucky?

01:08:05.456 --> 01:08:07.499
I got something for you, Rose.

01:08:12.254 --> 01:08:14.339
Rose?

01:08:42.576 --> 01:08:50.375
And now let's give a banging
welcome to our very sweet

01:08:50.501 --> 01:08:56.005
but very naughty Scarlet.

01:08:56.131 --> 01:08:58.049
Merry Christmas, Scarlet.

01:08:58.175 --> 01:09:00.468
Yeah.

01:09:10.062 --> 01:09:12.479
# Oh, the werewolf #

01:09:12.606 --> 01:09:15.108
# the werewolf #

01:09:15.234 --> 01:09:19.404
# Comes a stepping along #

01:09:21.823 --> 01:09:24.200
# He don't even #

01:09:24.326 --> 01:09:28.203
# break the branches
where he's gone #

01:09:30.707 --> 01:09:33.459
# Once I saw him #

01:09:33.586 --> 01:09:35.920
# in the moonlight #

01:09:36.046 --> 01:09:39.966
# when the bats were flying #

01:09:42.344 --> 01:09:46.096
# I saw the werewolf #

01:09:46.223 --> 01:09:51.435
# and the werewolf was cryin' #

01:09:51.562 --> 01:09:54.147
# Cryin' nobody #

01:09:54.273 --> 01:09:56.065
# nobody #

01:09:56.192 --> 01:09:58.735
# nobody knows #

01:09:58.861 --> 01:10:02.655
# nobody knows #

01:10:02.781 --> 01:10:06.284
# how I loved the man #

01:10:06.410 --> 01:10:12.040
# as I teared off his clothes #

01:10:12.166 --> 01:10:16.377
# Cryin' nobody, no #

01:10:16.503 --> 01:10:23.092
# nobody knows my pain #

01:10:23.219 --> 01:10:26.429
# when I see that it's risen #

01:10:26.555 --> 01:10:31.059
# that full moon again #

01:10:52.498 --> 01:10:54.999
# For the werewolf #

01:10:55.125 --> 01:10:57.669
# the werewolf #

01:10:57.795 --> 01:11:03.967
# have sympathy #

01:11:04.093 --> 01:11:07.095
# For the werewolf #

01:11:07.221 --> 01:11:11.015
# Somebody like you and me #

01:11:12.768 --> 01:11:17.188
# And only he goes to me #

01:11:17.314 --> 01:11:23.778
# Man, this little flute
I play #

01:11:23.904 --> 01:11:26.864
# All through the night #

01:11:26.991 --> 01:11:29.826
# Until the light of day #

01:11:29.952 --> 01:11:32.787
# and we are doomed to play #

01:11:52.725 --> 01:11:55.393
# For the werewolf #

01:11:55.519 --> 01:11:57.895
# For the werewolf #

01:11:58.022 --> 01:12:04.277
# Have sympathy #

01:12:04.403 --> 01:12:06.904
# For the werewolf #

01:12:07.031 --> 01:12:10.700
Come on!

01:12:10.826 --> 01:12:11.826
Come back.

01:12:11.952 --> 01:12:12.952
Where you going?

01:12:13.078 --> 01:12:16.039
Well, let's hear it
for Scarlet.

01:12:16.165 --> 01:12:21.252
She is just waiting
for that big bad wolf.

01:12:21.378 --> 01:12:23.713
And it might as well be you.

01:12:23.839 --> 01:12:24.839
Dancers only.

01:12:24.965 --> 01:12:26.382
I need to talk to Rose.

01:12:26.508 --> 01:12:27.967
To Scarlet, I need to talk-

01:12:28.093 --> 01:12:30.011
Which part
did you not understand?

01:12:38.354 --> 01:12:39.562
I need to talk to Rose.

01:12:39.688 --> 01:12:42.774
I need to talk to Rose,
come on!

01:13:48.799 --> 01:13:52.301
Why'd you leave?

01:13:52.428 --> 01:13:55.638
You didn't even leave a note.

01:13:55.764 --> 01:13:56.973
Men usually leave me first.

01:13:57.099 --> 01:14:00.810
I was just trying
to save you the trouble.

01:14:00.936 --> 01:14:04.897
Well, you're wrong about me.

01:14:05.023 --> 01:14:08.443
Why did you come today?

01:14:08.569 --> 01:14:12.071
I came for you.

01:14:12.197 --> 01:14:16.159
I'm a single mother
with a kid in a coma,

01:14:16.285 --> 01:14:18.327
and I make my living
by taking my clothes off.

01:14:18.454 --> 01:14:20.496
I'm a klutz,
and I spill everything.

01:14:20.622 --> 01:14:22.498
I work with the dead.

01:14:22.624 --> 01:14:23.624
I play with puppets.

01:14:23.750 --> 01:14:25.334
I've never had a real girlfriend
in my life,

01:14:25.461 --> 01:14:28.129
and I get nervous around people,
which triggers my asthma.

01:14:33.135 --> 01:14:35.887
Don't do this to me.

01:14:36.013 --> 01:14:41.767
I'm trying not to.

01:14:41.894 --> 01:14:51.027
Just promise me one thing.

01:14:51.153 --> 01:14:55.114
When tomorrow comes,
everything's gonna be okay.

01:14:55.240 --> 01:14:58.117
Everything's gonna be okay.

01:17:03.619 --> 01:17:05.369
I'm not playing games
with you.

01:17:05.495 --> 01:17:08.623
Fine, I'll get it myself.

01:17:36.943 --> 01:17:39.028
Give me my money.

01:17:39.154 --> 01:17:42.531
Tell me how I look.

01:17:42.658 --> 01:17:46.410
Because I am feeling
so glamorous tonight.

01:17:46.536 --> 01:17:47.745
Give me my money.

01:17:47.871 --> 01:17:49.830
Give me my money!

01:17:57.047 --> 01:18:00.174
You're no fun.

01:18:23.323 --> 01:18:25.366
Go and sit down.

01:18:25.492 --> 01:18:26.992
Sit down.

01:18:37.838 --> 01:18:40.798
I want you to...

01:18:40.924 --> 01:18:42.007
take your wig off.

01:18:45.429 --> 01:18:50.266
Just do it.

01:18:50.392 --> 01:18:55.020
Now...

01:18:55.147 --> 01:18:58.899
I want you to wipe off
your makeup.

01:18:59.025 --> 01:19:00.317
Just wipe it off.

01:19:04.448 --> 01:19:06.365
I like where this is going.

01:19:11.913 --> 01:19:15.791
Don't I look beautiful?

01:19:15.917 --> 01:19:18.252
Tell me I look beautiful.

01:19:18.378 --> 01:19:21.172
You said you wanted
to be flawless.

01:19:23.508 --> 01:19:25.426
With this-

01:19:25.552 --> 01:19:30.097
this money,
you can make that life-

01:19:30.223 --> 01:19:32.433
that part of your life-
perfect.

01:19:43.111 --> 01:19:44.111
Give me the gun.

01:19:44.237 --> 01:19:45.821
What?

01:19:45.947 --> 01:19:46.947
Give me the gun.

01:19:47.073 --> 01:19:48.824
You want to die, right?

01:19:48.950 --> 01:19:50.701
I can help you.

01:19:50.827 --> 01:19:53.162
I understand what you want.

01:19:53.288 --> 01:19:55.039
Please.

01:19:57.584 --> 01:19:58.959
Give me the gun.

01:19:59.085 --> 01:20:00.961
I want to help you.

01:20:04.841 --> 01:20:09.678
That night when you asked me
to take your life,

01:20:09.805 --> 01:20:12.681
I didn't understand why.

01:20:12.808 --> 01:20:16.477
Now I do.

01:20:16.603 --> 01:20:19.563
I understand everything now.

01:20:42.337 --> 01:20:45.923
I found that picture
in your car.

01:20:46.049 --> 01:20:48.634
And I couldn't help
but think about you,

01:20:48.760 --> 01:20:53.639
how lonely you must feel inside
without love.

01:21:03.567 --> 01:21:08.404
Do you want love in your life?

01:21:08.530 --> 01:21:10.823
Yeah.

01:21:10.949 --> 01:21:12.908
Then open your heart.

01:21:36.057 --> 01:21:37.600
Hey.

01:21:37.726 --> 01:21:39.018
What are you doing?

01:21:50.906 --> 01:21:54.116
You know...

01:21:54.242 --> 01:21:56.827
I used to love a man once.

01:21:56.953 --> 01:21:59.496
And I gave him my heart.

01:21:59.623 --> 01:22:02.166
I gave him my soul.

01:22:02.292 --> 01:22:05.127
I gave him my love.

01:22:05.253 --> 01:22:08.964
But that wasn't
good enough for him.

01:22:09.090 --> 01:22:12.718
That piece of shit
wanted a real woman.

01:22:12.844 --> 01:22:15.679
He wanted me
to give him something

01:22:15.805 --> 01:22:19.642
that I could never give him.

01:22:19.768 --> 01:22:20.768
So he left me.

01:22:38.119 --> 01:22:40.454
Who's gonna love me,
big daddy-o?

01:22:44.417 --> 01:22:46.293
God!

01:24:04.497 --> 01:24:06.457
At your service, ma'am.

01:24:09.753 --> 01:24:11.420
Does it fly?

01:24:11.546 --> 01:24:15.007
Faster than
the speed of sound.

01:24:15.133 --> 01:24:16.842
Wonderful.

01:24:16.968 --> 01:24:20.429
I will take a one-way ticket
to Paris, please.

01:24:20.555 --> 01:24:22.139
All right.

01:24:22.265 --> 01:24:23.515
Here we go.
- Okay.

01:24:23.641 --> 01:24:27.269
Come on.

01:24:27.395 --> 01:24:28.353
Whoo!

01:24:31.858 --> 01:24:34.568
Whoo!

01:25:28.498 --> 01:25:30.582
Did you get all
your Christmas shopping done?

01:25:30.708 --> 01:25:33.544
Oh, no, I'm gonna be shopping
at the gift shop tonight.

01:25:35.130 --> 01:25:36.964
Well, then, there's that.

01:25:40.718 --> 01:25:42.511
But the holidays
kind of get you down

01:25:42.637 --> 01:25:44.721
when you
see something like this.

01:25:44.848 --> 01:25:46.348
Yes, they do.

01:25:46.474 --> 01:25:48.433
Poor kid.

01:25:48.560 --> 01:25:50.727
Doctor's don't hold
much hope for him.

01:25:50.854 --> 01:25:52.729
I don't even know how
she's gonna pay for all this.

01:25:52.856 --> 01:25:54.439
I mean, come on.
She's a stripper, you know?

01:25:54.566 --> 01:25:55.649
They call it exotic dancer.

01:25:58.278 --> 01:26:00.154
Get the doctor now.

01:26:02.615 --> 01:26:03.949
We moved him to the code room.

01:26:04.075 --> 01:26:05.409
Heart rate was climbing fast.

01:26:05.535 --> 01:26:08.245
Oxygen saturation
well below 90%.

01:26:08.371 --> 01:26:10.038
This sounds like
pulmonary hemorrhage.

01:26:10.165 --> 01:26:11.874
Call pulmonary
and see if they can do a scope.

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:13.000
What do we have?

01:26:13.126 --> 01:26:14.084
Looks like massive PE,

01:26:14.210 --> 01:26:15.669
and his right ventricle
is starting to give out.

01:26:15.795 --> 01:26:17.713
Tell blood bank we need
three units now.

01:26:17.839 --> 01:26:18.797
Sir, you can't be in here.

01:26:18.923 --> 01:26:19.965
Wait, wait, what's going on?

01:26:20.091 --> 01:26:21.967
Sir, are you a relative?
- Yeah, he's my grandson.

01:26:22.093 --> 01:26:23.552
You need to go down
to the waiting room.

01:26:23.678 --> 01:26:25.012
It's down the hall to the left,
please.

01:26:25.138 --> 01:26:26.305
Wait, wait,
is he gonna be okay?

01:26:26.431 --> 01:26:27.472
We're trying everything
we can.

01:26:27.599 --> 01:26:29.016
Trust us.
- Did you contact his mother?

01:26:29.142 --> 01:26:30.559
We are trying
to locate her right now.

01:26:30.685 --> 01:26:31.727
Please.
A doctor will be right with you.

01:26:31.853 --> 01:26:33.520
Nurse, will you take him
to the waiting room?

01:26:33.646 --> 01:26:35.814
We're doing everything
we possibly can.

01:26:38.193 --> 01:26:42.863
Why are you doing this to me?

01:26:45.200 --> 01:26:47.910
Why?

01:26:48.036 --> 01:26:51.955
My only sin is love.

01:26:58.963 --> 01:27:01.715
We do not quit until his
condition stabilizes.

01:27:01.841 --> 01:27:02.966
Am I clear?
- Yes, doctor.

01:27:03.092 --> 01:27:04.593
Increase dopamine to 15.

01:27:05.845 --> 01:27:07.095
Someone pick up the damn phone.

01:27:07.222 --> 01:27:08.263
ICU.

01:27:08.389 --> 01:27:10.933
He's in V-tach.

01:27:11.059 --> 01:27:12.434
They can't find his mother.

01:27:12.560 --> 01:27:13.810
Taxi, taxi, wait!

01:27:13.937 --> 01:27:16.438
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

01:27:16.564 --> 01:27:17.689
Hey, stop!

01:27:17.815 --> 01:27:19.691
Please, I need a ride.
It's an emergency.

01:27:19.817 --> 01:27:21.610
I got to find my daughter.
Please wait.

01:27:21.736 --> 01:27:22.694
Stop, stop!

01:27:22.820 --> 01:27:24.571
Stop, please,
I got to find my daughter.

01:27:24.697 --> 01:27:25.656
I got to find my daughter.

01:27:25.782 --> 01:27:27.199
Please, please,
it's an emergency.

01:27:27.325 --> 01:27:28.283
I need to help her.

01:27:31.079 --> 01:27:33.455
Three, two, one, clear.

01:27:37.335 --> 01:27:38.919
Go to 120.

01:27:39.045 --> 01:27:42.506
Okay, three, two, one, clear.

01:27:42.632 --> 01:27:49.554
For I believe.

01:27:50.974 --> 01:27:54.017
Helped by unbelievers.

01:28:02.610 --> 01:28:04.611
Three, two, one, clear.

01:28:08.074 --> 01:28:09.199
Go to 240.

01:28:16.624 --> 01:28:19.042
Rose!

01:28:19.168 --> 01:28:20.460
Rose, where are you?

01:28:28.761 --> 01:28:30.178
Rose.

01:28:30.305 --> 01:28:31.305
Rose!

01:28:36.185 --> 01:28:38.395
Clear.

01:28:38.521 --> 01:28:40.230
Again.

01:28:40.356 --> 01:28:41.732
Clear.

01:29:22.023 --> 01:29:26.568
I guess it's not coming
after all, the rain.

01:29:26.694 --> 01:29:29.071
I was looking forward to it.

01:29:32.408 --> 01:29:33.742
Mind if I join you?

01:29:34.369 --> 01:29:36.411
If you wish.

01:29:42.001 --> 01:29:43.752
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:29:43.878 --> 01:29:46.213
Were you expecting someone?

01:29:46.339 --> 01:29:52.052
No, I just-
I just like sitting alone.

01:29:52.178 --> 01:29:55.263
Most of us have forgotten
how pleasurable it can be.

01:30:02.688 --> 01:30:04.439
What is your name?

01:30:04.565 --> 01:30:07.776
Diana.

01:30:07.902 --> 01:30:10.737
Charlie.

01:30:10.863 --> 01:30:14.324
Nice to meet you, father.

01:30:14.450 --> 01:30:16.451
No, please.

01:30:16.577 --> 01:30:18.412
Could you just call me Charlie?

01:30:23.793 --> 01:30:25.335
Is that how we first met?

01:30:25.461 --> 01:30:26.461
Exactly.

01:30:28.297 --> 01:30:31.716
I was even wearing
this red coat, remember?

01:30:31.843 --> 01:30:32.884
How could I forget that?

01:30:33.010 --> 01:30:34.428
You looked beautiful.

01:30:41.310 --> 01:30:43.145
Charlie.

01:30:43.271 --> 01:30:44.521
Yeah?

01:30:48.526 --> 01:30:52.821
It's not your time yet.

01:30:52.947 --> 01:30:55.490
I'm not going anywhere.

01:30:55.616 --> 01:30:59.744
I'll be right here
waiting for you.

01:30:59.871 --> 01:31:02.831
My God, I love you.

01:31:02.957 --> 01:31:06.001
I never stopped loving you.

01:31:06.127 --> 01:31:08.044
Father?

01:31:08.171 --> 01:31:10.380
Father Bishop?

01:31:14.552 --> 01:31:18.388
Father Bishop,
what are you doing here?

01:31:18.514 --> 01:31:20.974
Are you returning to us?

01:31:26.981 --> 01:31:31.234
God bless you, sister.

01:31:31.360 --> 01:31:33.528
God bless you.

01:33:18.134 --> 01:33:22.387
I didn't call last night
because I-

01:33:22.513 --> 01:33:24.556
I wanted to believe

01:33:24.682 --> 01:33:27.309
that everything
was gonna be all right.

01:33:34.233 --> 01:33:37.152
I'm so sorry, baby.

01:34:16.609 --> 01:34:20.153
I love you, sweet pea.

01:35:22.550 --> 01:35:23.550
Let it go!

01:35:23.676 --> 01:35:24.634
Hey!

01:35:27.388 --> 01:35:29.139
There it is.

01:35:32.101 --> 01:35:34.602
Rose?
Thank God I caught you.

01:35:34.729 --> 01:35:36.104
I need you to sign this.

01:35:36.230 --> 01:35:38.064
It's the receipt
for your hospital bill.

01:35:38.190 --> 01:35:40.608
Everything's been paid for.

01:35:42.194 --> 01:35:43.653
I don't know
what you're talking about.

01:35:43.779 --> 01:35:45.113
Well, a gentleman
came in last night

01:35:45.239 --> 01:35:46.448
and paid all the hospital bills.

01:35:46.574 --> 01:35:49.659
He wanted to remain anonymous.

01:35:49.785 --> 01:35:52.245
I'm sorry about Billy.

01:35:57.668 --> 01:35:59.669
He left this for you.

01:36:34.705 --> 01:36:38.541
So you have any room left
for a slice of pie?

01:36:38.667 --> 01:36:40.627
No, sorry, I'm-
I'm full.

01:36:42.004 --> 01:36:43.004
I have to say,

01:36:43.130 --> 01:36:45.757
you look really good
this morning.

01:36:45.883 --> 01:36:47.926
Thanks.

01:36:48.052 --> 01:36:50.512
You might want to know
that my ex-husband and I,

01:36:50.638 --> 01:36:52.764
we tried to talk,
but who were we kidding?

01:36:52.890 --> 01:36:55.809
And I don't know
if you have plans tonight,

01:36:55.935 --> 01:36:59.062
but I've got a brand-new dress
and nowhere to go.

01:36:59.188 --> 01:37:00.605
Are you asking me out?

01:37:00.731 --> 01:37:02.649
Are you accepting?

01:37:03.317 --> 01:37:04.526
Yes.

01:37:04.652 --> 01:37:05.902
Oh, yeah?
Good.

01:37:06.028 --> 01:37:07.862
Here, let me give you my number.

01:37:07.988 --> 01:37:10.615
Oh, okay.

01:37:10.741 --> 01:37:14.744
Should we say, like,
my place, like 6:00?

01:37:14.870 --> 01:37:16.746
6:00.

01:37:16.872 --> 01:37:18.957
All right, I'll be waiting.

01:37:19.083 --> 01:37:20.792
I'll be there.

01:37:27.341 --> 01:37:28.424
Hey.

01:37:28.551 --> 01:37:30.635
Hey, I called in last week,

01:37:30.761 --> 01:37:32.929
and I was looking for the girl
with the dog.

01:37:33.055 --> 01:37:35.890
I was-I was just wondering,
is she-is she still there?

01:37:36.016 --> 01:37:39.435
No, she's gone.

01:37:39.562 --> 01:37:42.021
No, I don't know,
but she's gone, man.

01:37:42.147 --> 01:37:44.816
No, her and dog leave.
Not my fault.

01:37:44.942 --> 01:37:46.818
No, I'm-
No, I am sorry.

01:38:48.255 --> 01:38:51.132
I saw him laughing.

01:38:51.258 --> 01:38:53.051
See you, guys.
- Hey, good show.

01:38:53.177 --> 01:38:54.135
Good show, thank you.

01:38:54.261 --> 01:38:55.595
Can we get
something to eat, dad?

01:38:55.721 --> 01:38:56.721
Bye, Maggie.

01:38:56.847 --> 01:38:57.805
See ya.

01:38:57.932 --> 01:39:00.308
Bye.
-Bye.

01:39:52.319 --> 01:39:54.988
I have two tickets to Paris.

01:41:42.012 --> 01:41:45.515
# Isn't she surprising? #

01:41:45.641 --> 01:41:48.142
# Aren't you amazed? #

01:41:48.268 --> 01:41:52.146
# Everything you thought
you had to be #

01:41:52.272 --> 01:41:56.359
# goes up in flames #

01:41:56.485 --> 01:41:59.737
# Isn't she enlightening? #

01:41:59.863 --> 01:42:02.615
# Try toe be amused #

01:42:02.741 --> 01:42:07.912
# Reason doesn't work
when you're brand-new #

01:42:10.791 --> 01:42:18.297
# If you want to know
of what you're made #

01:42:18.423 --> 01:42:22.009
# Hey, where you going? #

01:42:22.136 --> 01:42:25.763
# The woman is the way #

01:42:32.187 --> 01:42:35.523
# Wouldn't try to bite #

01:42:35.649 --> 01:42:38.442
# when she calls your name #

01:42:38.569 --> 01:42:40.820
# You might not see something #

01:42:40.946 --> 01:42:46.159
# that might say it ever again #

01:42:46.285 --> 01:42:48.536
# And if you give her
one chance, man #

01:42:48.662 --> 01:42:52.123
# she's gonna take you
right to yourself #

01:42:52.249 --> 01:42:55.668
# Yourself #

01:42:55.794 --> 01:43:00.840
# Or else #

01:43:00.966 --> 01:43:02.049
# Try to make it run #

01:43:02.176 --> 01:43:06.596
# but the happy just won't seem
to leave you alone #

01:43:06.722 --> 01:43:10.308
# Oh, well #

01:43:10.434 --> 01:43:15.062
# Oh, well #

01:43:15.189 --> 01:43:16.564
# Say you want it all #

01:43:16.690 --> 01:43:20.985
# but the hole won't fill
unless you fill it with her #

01:43:21.111 --> 01:43:24.614
# Oh, well #

01:43:24.740 --> 01:43:29.035
# Oh, well #

01:43:29.161 --> 01:43:31.078
# So shut your mouth #

01:43:31.205 --> 01:43:37.168
# Turn down that brain
that's led you astray #

01:43:37.294 --> 01:43:40.713
# And you'll never know her, but
#

01:43:40.839 --> 01:43:43.549
# the woman is the way #

01:44:40.941 --> 01:44:44.360
# Always remind me #

01:44:44.486 --> 01:44:48.322
# how you almost got by me #

01:44:48.448 --> 01:44:52.868
# I don't know what
I would have done #

01:44:52.995 --> 01:44:55.121
# without you, honey #

01:45:32.826 --> 01:45:36.287
# Tell it to her softly #

01:45:36.413 --> 01:45:39.415
# Tell her like you should #

01:45:39.541 --> 01:45:42.626
# Tell her that no matter what #

01:45:42.753 --> 01:45:45.880
# she'll always have #

01:45:46.006 --> 01:45:47.006
# your love #

01:45:47.007 --> 01:45:48.007
