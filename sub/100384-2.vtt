00:12.910 --> 00:14.106
Hey, what's up, Cap?

00:14.131 --> 00:15.401
'Sup, baby?

00:15.426 --> 00:17.210
Little spring in your step there, Cap.

00:17.235 --> 00:18.250
You get laid or something?

00:18.275 --> 00:19.281
Eh, I'm just feeling

00:19.306 --> 00:21.099
a little more at home in Austin.

00:21.124 --> 00:23.079
Found an organic food market.

00:23.104 --> 00:24.792
I found a vitamin shop that sells

00:24.817 --> 00:26.435
my fish oil supplements I like,

00:26.460 --> 00:29.633
a CorePower Yoga studio
within walking distance.

00:29.658 --> 00:31.317
I mean, the place is like New York

00:31.342 --> 00:33.107
with just a lot less
trash on the street.

00:33.132 --> 00:34.521
Here you go, Cap.

00:34.546 --> 00:35.554
Mm.

00:35.579 --> 00:36.783
Mmm.

00:38.488 --> 00:40.381
Hey, you cut yourself, Cap?

00:40.406 --> 00:41.752
Oh, that's the other thing.

00:41.777 --> 00:43.661
I found a dermatologist
that follows the same

00:43.686 --> 00:45.384
hair protocols as my
guy in New York City.

00:45.409 --> 00:47.066
You have hair protocols?

00:47.091 --> 00:48.232
I'm putting in for a transfer.

00:48.257 --> 00:50.183
Hey, go ahead and laugh,
but I'm convinced

00:50.208 --> 00:51.597
it's the only reason I
haven't lost my hair.

00:51.622 --> 00:52.624
Well...

00:52.649 --> 00:53.946
Hey, I'm not trying to hate on anyone

00:53.971 --> 00:56.302
for taking advantage of
science to level up.

00:56.327 --> 00:58.556
So every six weeks, I
get my scalp injected

00:58.581 --> 00:59.938
with a drug called finasteride.

00:59.963 --> 01:01.113
It promotes hair growth.

01:01.138 --> 01:02.564
I think it's that combination

01:02.589 --> 01:04.486
of treatment and trauma

01:04.510 --> 01:05.940
that really makes your hair grow.

01:05.965 --> 01:08.952
I also use finasteride
drops twice a day

01:08.977 --> 01:11.063
and then once at night orally.

01:11.635 --> 01:14.204
Also, it's been great
for my prostate health.

01:14.452 --> 01:15.819
I think you'd look good bald.

01:17.032 --> 01:18.563
I like that shaved head look.

01:18.665 --> 01:20.977
Bruce Willis, The Rock...
It's super masculine.

01:21.085 --> 01:24.177
Look, all I'm saying:
at a certain point,

01:24.202 --> 01:26.071
a guy needs to have a signature look,

01:26.096 --> 01:27.752
something to define him.

01:27.777 --> 01:29.053
I'm the guy with the hair.

01:29.078 --> 01:31.146
I mean, every time I get
one of those caricatures

01:31.171 --> 01:33.810
from a guy on the street,
my hair is, like, enormous.

01:33.835 --> 01:34.894
Every time?

01:34.919 --> 01:36.514
How often do you sit for one of those?

01:38.072 --> 01:39.601
I think you have an irrational fear

01:39.626 --> 01:40.765
of losing your hair, Cap.

01:44.272 --> 01:46.240
Who says it's irrational?

01:51.001 --> 01:54.214
It's Morelli's, so you know
they are gonna work us

01:54.239 --> 01:55.908
around the clock on this presentation.

01:55.933 --> 01:57.896
Yep, but at least it's Morelli's.

01:57.921 --> 02:00.179
Did you get those portfolios from Ivan?

02:00.204 --> 02:02.000
I just need a John Hancock here.

02:02.025 --> 02:03.197
He's supposed to email them.

02:03.222 --> 02:04.925
Or a Jane Hancock, as it were.

02:04.950 --> 02:06.652
You have got to stay on him.

02:06.677 --> 02:07.688
Yeah.

02:07.713 --> 02:09.281
- Excuse me?
- Yep?

02:09.306 --> 02:10.967
- I have the card on file.
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:10.991 --> 02:12.202
Just need a signature.

02:12.227 --> 02:13.227
Sure, man.

02:13.252 --> 02:14.459
I need those by this afternoon.

02:14.484 --> 02:16.404
- I'm on it.
- Thank you.

02:17.593 --> 02:19.428
I say we start out strong.

02:19.453 --> 02:21.457
Tell the investors
that this is a chance

02:21.482 --> 02:23.707
to be a part of something
that could change the world,

02:23.827 --> 02:25.316
literally save lives.

02:25.444 --> 02:27.661
And make them a crap ton of
money while they're at it.

02:27.686 --> 02:29.480
That's good. Write that down.

02:29.674 --> 02:31.000
Mm-hmm.

02:31.090 --> 02:34.915
And after their, uh, expected ROI,

02:34.940 --> 02:37.417
I thought we could move on to, uh...

02:37.469 --> 02:41.873
to, uh... to, um...

02:41.898 --> 02:43.133
Liza, you okay?

02:43.161 --> 02:46.102
Uh, yeah, just, uh, nerves.

02:46.263 --> 02:48.411
I'm so... itchy.

02:48.436 --> 02:50.191
It's okay.

02:50.216 --> 02:51.679
It's okay.

02:54.707 --> 02:56.718
Hey, hey, stop that.

02:56.886 --> 02:58.514
I think that, uh...

03:00.318 --> 03:03.023
- What's wrong with her?
- I'm sorry, I, uh...

03:04.917 --> 03:06.246
I'm on the edge of my seat here.

03:06.271 --> 03:08.467
Uh, right, right, we
were going to move...

03:08.492 --> 03:10.239
Transition to portfolio projections

03:10.264 --> 03:12.832
and first-quarter profits,
which we hope will double.

03:12.857 --> 03:14.298
Liza!

03:14.323 --> 03:16.408
- What are you doing?
- Liza, stop! Liza!

03:16.433 --> 03:18.491
Oh, no!

03:18.516 --> 03:21.351
- Stop it! No!
- Liza!

03:21.892 --> 03:25.224
- Synced and corrected by martythecrazy -
- www.addic7ed.com -

03:34.185 --> 03:35.770
Hey, this don't make no sense,

03:35.795 --> 03:38.075
because that glass should
be tempered for hurricanes.

03:38.100 --> 03:40.116
Oh, I've seen this back in the city.

03:40.141 --> 03:42.256
When people are committed,
they'll find a way.

03:42.281 --> 03:44.919
Judging by that forehead,
she was very committed.

03:45.170 --> 03:46.536
Or should have been.

03:46.561 --> 03:47.646
She's gone.

03:49.713 --> 03:51.215
I-I could tell Liza was nervous

03:51.240 --> 03:53.893
about the pitch tomorrow, but
one minute, she was fine.

03:53.918 --> 03:56.645
The next, she was like
somebody from Bird Box.

03:56.670 --> 03:58.297
- Bird Box?
- Netflix?

03:58.322 --> 03:59.722
Sandra Bullock?

04:01.819 --> 04:05.885
JT, to your knowledge, was
Liza on any substances?

04:06.736 --> 04:09.345
No, she was two years sober.
She knew better than that.

04:09.370 --> 04:10.675
Uh, Officer...

04:10.700 --> 04:12.637
Stressed-out people sometimes
do irrational things.

04:12.662 --> 04:14.325
- If you can think of...
- Officer!

04:15.814 --> 04:16.940
Sir?

04:16.966 --> 04:17.902
They're inside me!

04:17.927 --> 04:19.326
- Make them stop!
- Sir, you're okay!

04:19.351 --> 04:21.216
Just put your... sir,
put your weapon down!

04:21.242 --> 04:22.619
Put the weapon down right now!

04:22.644 --> 04:23.734
Make it stop!

04:23.759 --> 04:25.762
Put the weapon down! Put the...

04:26.091 --> 04:27.460
Get down! Get down!

04:27.485 --> 04:29.093
Get down! Hands back.

04:29.118 --> 04:30.601
McCoy, stop her! Stop her!

04:30.626 --> 04:33.323
Ma'am, ma'am, away from the window!

04:33.348 --> 04:35.377
- No, stop!
- Sir, sir!

04:35.402 --> 04:37.450
Someone stop him! Grab him now!

04:37.475 --> 04:40.052
Dispatch, we're a code
six at 383 Highway.

04:40.077 --> 04:42.643
Send everyone... Stop! Stop! Stop!

04:42.668 --> 04:44.037
Stop him!

04:44.062 --> 04:45.653
Send everyone you got.

04:48.236 --> 04:50.031
Mateo, Judd!

04:50.063 --> 04:51.143
- Yep.
- On it.

04:51.168 --> 04:52.218
Ah.

04:56.347 --> 04:57.874
Oh!

04:58.135 --> 04:59.823
We need to get up there right now.

05:00.540 --> 05:02.583
No carbon monoxide. No sulfides.

05:02.608 --> 05:05.235
If this was airborne, there'd
be 40 people down, not 9.

05:05.260 --> 05:07.050
Looks like you could use
some help, Officer.

05:07.126 --> 05:09.742
We got three jumpers, several
victims suffering seizures,

05:09.767 --> 05:11.418
two people stabbed themselves.

05:11.443 --> 05:12.926
All symptoms came without warning.

05:12.951 --> 05:14.490
APD Special Response is on its way.

05:14.515 --> 05:17.141
In the meantime, we rounded up
everybody who's still standing.

05:19.985 --> 05:21.868
Keep your head still. Sir!

05:22.208 --> 05:24.959
Sir... Okay.

05:25.355 --> 05:26.623
What are they presenting?

05:26.648 --> 05:29.133
BP's barely detectable.
Arrhythmias everywhere.

05:29.158 --> 05:31.022
Lockjaw, muscle tremors.

05:31.047 --> 05:32.645
I've never seen anything
like this, Cap.

05:32.670 --> 05:34.170
We need to get these
people transported.

05:34.195 --> 05:35.325
We're not going anywhere till we know

05:35.350 --> 05:36.302
what we're dealing with.

05:36.327 --> 05:37.482
Let's close this building down.

05:37.507 --> 05:39.654
Help! Holly, she's turning!

05:39.679 --> 05:42.602
Ma'am! Ma'am, no!

05:42.627 --> 05:43.876
Can I get some help over here?

05:43.901 --> 05:45.242
Ma'am!

05:46.918 --> 05:48.648
Let me see.

05:48.673 --> 05:53.522
Light aversions, convulsions,
paresthesia, mania.

05:53.547 --> 05:56.190
I think this might be a
severe case of erethism.

05:56.215 --> 05:58.408
Mad Hatter's disease.

05:58.433 --> 06:00.925
19th-century hatmakers
really used to go insane

06:00.950 --> 06:02.925
because they handled
small doses of mercury.

06:02.950 --> 06:04.479
Handle a large dose, and...

06:04.504 --> 06:06.473
People go straight Bird Box.

06:08.313 --> 06:09.581
Sandra Bullock.

06:09.606 --> 06:11.641
So why are some people
down and not others?

06:11.666 --> 06:13.562
That's the million-dollar
question, isn't it?

06:16.271 --> 06:18.868
Listen, you need to contact
North Austin Regional,

06:18.893 --> 06:21.365
Mercy, and University
Medical and tell them

06:21.390 --> 06:23.020
that they need to get
their trauma teams ready.

06:23.045 --> 06:24.059
Right.

06:24.084 --> 06:25.233
- You got her?
- Yeah.

06:25.258 --> 06:26.628
- Let me get this arm.
- Okay.

06:26.653 --> 06:29.004
If you are feeling sick, speak up!

06:29.029 --> 06:31.282
No one leaves until Special Response

06:31.307 --> 06:33.038
clears you to go.

06:33.293 --> 06:35.840
Whose quinoa is this?

06:36.771 --> 06:38.573
Why do I feel like he's doing a thing?

06:38.598 --> 06:40.609
He's totally doing a thing.

06:41.590 --> 06:43.853
Hey, the guy who landed
on the coffee cart,

06:43.878 --> 06:45.162
he's gonna survive,

06:45.187 --> 06:47.603
so thank God for overpriced pastries.

06:47.628 --> 06:48.976
Is he doing a thing?

06:49.001 --> 06:50.534
Uh-huh.

06:50.559 --> 06:52.249
Whose juice is this?

06:52.274 --> 06:54.400
I'm on a cleanse. Why?

06:57.551 --> 06:59.240
Let me see your hands.

07:00.830 --> 07:02.382
What'd you have for lunch?

07:02.407 --> 07:05.061
Skipped it... big breakfast.

07:05.426 --> 07:07.027
Wait for it.

07:07.052 --> 07:08.496
I know who did this.

07:17.284 --> 07:18.574
Mercury.

07:33.928 --> 07:36.988
I'm looking for, uh, Ladder 126.

07:37.013 --> 07:38.678
Somebody ordered delivery.

07:38.703 --> 07:39.889
That'd be us, boss.

07:39.914 --> 07:41.994
Heard you had the best cookies in town.

07:42.019 --> 07:43.428
Yeah, that's right.

07:43.453 --> 07:46.038
Other than the ones you
laced with mercury?

07:46.063 --> 07:48.087
Put your hands up right now!

07:48.112 --> 07:49.512
Put your hands up!

07:49.537 --> 07:50.905
On your knees.

08:09.436 --> 08:10.701
Why?

08:11.867 --> 08:13.238
They never tip.

08:14.468 --> 08:16.786
Years, treat me like I'm invisible,

08:16.811 --> 08:19.073
like I'm a nonperson.

08:20.381 --> 08:22.299
Well, they'll remember me now.

08:33.856 --> 08:35.722
I won't sugarcoat it.

08:35.749 --> 08:37.979
What we do here is controversial.

08:38.004 --> 08:41.249
It's called adaptive therapy,
and rather than carpet-bomb

08:41.280 --> 08:43.399
your cancer and your body,

08:43.424 --> 08:45.405
we use immunotherapy and limited chemo

08:45.430 --> 08:46.686
to slow its growth.

08:46.711 --> 08:48.172
So you don't even try to cure it.

08:48.197 --> 08:49.212
We contain it.

08:49.237 --> 08:51.028
You learn to live with the enemy.

08:51.053 --> 08:52.302
Mm, something like that.

08:52.327 --> 08:55.183
We do it right, you will
die an old man with cancer

08:55.208 --> 08:58.720
rather than from cancer many,
many, many years from now.

08:58.745 --> 09:00.313
That's a little morbid,

09:00.338 --> 09:02.145
but I like the "many, many" part.

09:02.170 --> 09:04.955
will
this cause hair loss?

09:04.980 --> 09:06.881
It's one of the upsides
of a targeted approach:

09:06.906 --> 09:08.175
less collateral damage.

09:08.200 --> 09:10.857
You will keep your
gorgeous locks, Captain.

09:10.882 --> 09:12.417
Oh, thank God.

09:12.442 --> 09:14.645
And I just found this
amazing woman down here,

09:14.670 --> 09:15.825
Dr. Akopian.

09:15.850 --> 09:19.548
She is a hairline-sculpting
Michelangelo.

09:19.573 --> 09:21.444
Yeah, you need to stop
seeing her immediately.

09:21.469 --> 09:23.592
Why would I do something
insane like that?

09:23.617 --> 09:26.713
Dr. Akopian specializes in finasteride,

09:26.738 --> 09:29.384
and it would interfere
with our therapy.

09:29.409 --> 09:31.087
I've been on this a decade.

09:31.112 --> 09:33.780
What would happen if I
suddenly stopped taking it?

09:33.805 --> 09:35.917
Well, it is possible that your scalp

09:35.949 --> 09:37.329
could go into follicular shock,

09:37.357 --> 09:38.589
and you could lose your hair.

09:38.616 --> 09:40.304
But this is my signature look.

09:40.329 --> 09:41.616
You gave me your word.

09:41.641 --> 09:43.967
You told me I was not
going to lose my hair.

09:43.992 --> 09:45.940
Better that than your life.

09:50.717 --> 09:53.854
I want you to close your
eyes for a focus exercise.

09:53.879 --> 09:56.331
You want me to focus on what, exactly?

09:56.356 --> 09:58.057
The night of the incident,

09:58.082 --> 09:59.819
when you lost your friends.

10:01.354 --> 10:04.162
Doc, uh, with all due,

10:04.187 --> 10:07.047
don't you think it might
be a little unreasonable

10:07.072 --> 10:10.111
to ask him to just jump
straight into that?

10:11.165 --> 10:14.809
Are either of you familiar
with the Zeigarnik effect?

10:14.834 --> 10:18.140
Incomplete tasks trap the brain

10:18.165 --> 10:20.383
into loops of repetitive thinking.

10:20.408 --> 10:22.235
It's kind of like when you
hear a tune on the radio

10:22.260 --> 10:24.017
but you have to get out of
the car before it's over.

10:24.042 --> 10:26.083
You hum it all day.
The Zeigarnik effect.

10:26.108 --> 10:28.563
So what does me having
a Kenny Chesney song

10:28.588 --> 10:30.524
stuck in my head have
to do with anything?

10:31.398 --> 10:33.762
People suffering from PTSD

10:34.192 --> 10:36.857
tend to avoid the bad memories
that caused the condition.

10:37.929 --> 10:39.698
The brain gets stuck in the trauma,

10:39.723 --> 10:41.976
so it keeps bringing those
terrible experiences

10:42.001 --> 10:44.588
back to the surface to be processed.

10:44.613 --> 10:47.916
But what if I ain't, uh,
ready to process yet?

10:49.029 --> 10:51.098
Baby, I'll be right here.

10:51.825 --> 10:54.592
Okay? Look at me.

10:54.617 --> 10:56.480
You got this.

10:58.231 --> 10:59.706
Okay.

11:01.682 --> 11:02.950
Let's do it.

11:05.218 --> 11:09.210
Counting breaths is a
powerful tool for healing.

11:10.336 --> 11:12.058
I want you to close your eyes

11:12.083 --> 11:15.287
and count each breath up to five.

11:15.469 --> 11:17.738
One, two, three, four, five.

11:17.770 --> 11:19.103
Judd.

11:19.218 --> 11:21.540
Count each breath, and as you do,

11:22.242 --> 11:25.515
try to remember that night...
as it happened.

11:35.942 --> 11:37.073
One.

11:37.744 --> 11:40.242
Garrity, hit it with
everything you got.

11:41.528 --> 11:42.834
Two.

11:42.859 --> 11:46.740
Hey, y'all be ready to hold on tight!

11:48.094 --> 11:49.945
That's all I got for you, big boy.

11:49.970 --> 11:52.330
- I'm done. I'm done.
- Hold on, Judd. Babe.

11:52.355 --> 11:54.191
- I'm good.
- Judd.

12:00.794 --> 12:02.304
It's a process.

12:04.071 --> 12:05.545
Okay.

12:18.929 --> 12:21.130
- Thank you for coming so fast.
- Where is he?

12:21.155 --> 12:25.425
Uh, I would've called 9-1-1,
but, um, he said it was like

12:25.450 --> 12:26.770
breathing through a straw,

12:26.795 --> 12:28.398
and now he can't talk.

12:36.711 --> 12:40.752
Hey, Tomas, I'm Michelle.
Remember me from the other day?

12:41.166 --> 12:44.256
The crazy lady.

12:44.281 --> 12:46.857
Yeah. Yeah.

12:46.882 --> 12:48.474
Let's get you up.

12:48.959 --> 12:52.118
Okay, I need you to
take two puffs of this

12:52.143 --> 12:54.107
and breathe real deep, okay?

12:58.770 --> 13:00.048
Okay.

13:02.795 --> 13:04.856
Okay, let's get you down.

13:04.985 --> 13:06.243
Listen to me.

13:06.268 --> 13:08.315
I need you to hold your
son completely still

13:08.340 --> 13:09.904
no matter how uncomfortable he gets.

13:09.929 --> 13:11.237
Do you understand?

13:11.262 --> 13:12.679
I'm gonna intubate him.

13:12.704 --> 13:14.493
Please save him.

13:18.586 --> 13:20.157
I'll get your head.

13:20.182 --> 13:21.492
Okay.

13:21.517 --> 13:23.196
Okay.

13:23.657 --> 13:25.021
Here we go, kiddo.

13:32.652 --> 13:33.935
Okay.

13:35.053 --> 13:37.227
You're doing so good, buddy.

13:44.198 --> 13:45.733
Come on.

13:53.579 --> 13:55.493
Gracias a Dios.

13:58.986 --> 14:00.508
Gracias.

14:03.538 --> 14:05.184
This is for you.

14:05.432 --> 14:07.134
- Thank you.
- Don't lose it.

14:07.168 --> 14:08.169
Okay.

14:09.549 --> 14:11.855
You can get him some
over-the-counter allergy meds

14:11.880 --> 14:13.513
to help with the congestion,

14:13.827 --> 14:15.662
and the albuterol is for the attacks.

14:15.687 --> 14:17.044
It should last a few months.

14:17.069 --> 14:18.862
Uh, if you need more, you can call me.

14:18.887 --> 14:20.576
Thank you.

14:23.660 --> 14:25.386
How much do I owe you?

14:26.619 --> 14:28.343
Don't worry about it.

14:31.643 --> 14:33.465
Um, wait.

14:34.380 --> 14:38.619
Um, we were all very
sorry about your sister.

14:39.118 --> 14:40.621
Thank you.

14:48.515 --> 14:51.575
Gustavo, is there something
that you wanna tell me?

14:53.662 --> 14:57.058
Your sister and that man Mr. Dustin,

14:57.083 --> 15:00.892
they were yelling, and
then your sister left.

15:00.917 --> 15:02.707
Her car was still here.

15:02.732 --> 15:04.401
Someone else picked her up.

15:04.731 --> 15:06.227
What?

15:06.252 --> 15:08.212
In a blue pickup truck.

15:11.542 --> 15:13.593
I should have said something before.

15:14.403 --> 15:16.105
I'm... I'm sorry.

15:17.760 --> 15:19.467
Don't be sorry.

15:19.492 --> 15:22.102
It's the most anyone's
said to me in three years.

15:48.134 --> 15:51.168
I mean, the guy told me
that he saw my sister

15:51.193 --> 15:53.529
leave that night in a
blue pickup truck.

15:53.554 --> 15:55.667
I mean, Carlos, this
changes everything.

15:55.692 --> 15:57.259
Wow, that's huge.

15:57.284 --> 16:02.381
So... was it a man or a woman
driving, one or two people?

16:02.406 --> 16:03.430
I don't know.

16:03.455 --> 16:05.170
I mean, he just said
a blue pickup truck.

16:05.195 --> 16:06.674
And he could tell that for sure

16:06.699 --> 16:08.180
in the dark from across the street?

16:08.205 --> 16:11.090
I can't believe you. We
finally have a lead.

16:11.206 --> 16:15.034
Someone saw Iris alive
leaving Dustin's house.

16:15.059 --> 16:17.568
Why are you being a dick about it?

16:18.821 --> 16:21.458
I just don't want you to
get your hopes too high.

16:21.665 --> 16:23.675
Literally a quarter of the vehicles

16:23.700 --> 16:26.165
on the road in Texas are pickup trucks.

16:26.697 --> 16:30.287
Honestly, you'd probably be as well off

16:30.305 --> 16:31.642
going to a curandera as a cop.

16:31.668 --> 16:34.171
A witch? That's your advice for me?

16:34.196 --> 16:36.134
My TÃ­a Lucy sees one.

16:36.858 --> 16:39.949
The curandera told her to
buy homeowner's insurance.

16:39.974 --> 16:41.728
The next week, Lucy's
water heater broke,

16:41.753 --> 16:42.924
flooded the whole house.

16:42.949 --> 16:44.828
- Really?
- True story.

16:44.919 --> 16:47.102
That's ridiculous.

16:48.064 --> 16:50.308
Yeah, it really is.

16:54.502 --> 16:55.585
What do you want?

16:55.610 --> 16:57.131
You want one of Cap's half-caf caps,

16:57.156 --> 16:58.341
a little almond milk?

16:58.586 --> 17:00.701
I have some oat milk in here somewhere,

17:00.726 --> 17:02.302
but it doesn't foam as well.

17:02.330 --> 17:05.653
I want a coffee with some creamer.

17:05.678 --> 17:07.540
Oh, I don't think it can do that.

17:07.566 --> 17:08.968
All right.

17:08.992 --> 17:10.904
Oh, Judd, listen.

17:10.929 --> 17:12.790
I hate to ask, but I'm
gonna need to see

17:12.816 --> 17:14.999
some documentation that
you've been going to therapy.

17:15.023 --> 17:18.324
What, the pissed-off look on
my face isn't enough proof?

17:18.781 --> 17:20.871
Nah, the doctor signed some stuff,

17:20.896 --> 17:21.986
and I'll get it to you.

17:22.011 --> 17:23.415
Good, I appreciate that.

17:24.232 --> 17:25.534
So what about you?

17:25.559 --> 17:28.732
You, uh, find somebody
right away for your hair?

17:28.757 --> 17:31.468
Or what about that, uh...

17:31.493 --> 17:33.548
What about the other
thing you told me about?

17:33.883 --> 17:35.770
I saw someone.

17:35.795 --> 17:37.379
It's bad?

17:37.853 --> 17:39.778
Well, the treatment that
they're recommending

17:39.803 --> 17:42.505
would require some lifestyle changes.

17:42.530 --> 17:44.412
What, like not working?

17:44.437 --> 17:47.321
'Cause I had an aunt who had,
uh, chemo, and, you know,

17:47.346 --> 17:48.854
I'll be honest with you, it was rough,

17:48.879 --> 17:50.647
but now she's back teaching.

17:50.672 --> 17:51.893
She's riding on the weekends.

17:51.918 --> 17:53.567
It's like it never happened.

17:53.592 --> 17:55.026
It's more than that.

17:55.529 --> 17:57.309
It's a hair thing.

17:57.811 --> 17:59.509
It's a hair thing.

17:59.649 --> 18:01.282
Yeah, they don't want
me taking my pills

18:01.307 --> 18:03.713
or doing my drops 'cause they say

18:03.738 --> 18:06.640
it might interfere with the
protocol they're recommending.

18:07.140 --> 18:09.542
What does TK say?

18:09.567 --> 18:12.922
I mean, I bet he'd rather have
a bald dad than a dead dad.

18:13.192 --> 18:15.039
Haven't told him yet. He
doesn't know I'm sick.

18:18.174 --> 18:20.266
And you say I need to see a therapist.

18:21.568 --> 18:23.318
He's had a lot on his plate.

18:23.343 --> 18:25.075
I don't wanna tell him till he's ready.

18:26.433 --> 18:28.520
Till he's ready, till you're ready?

18:39.113 --> 18:40.531
Okay, take a breath for me, ma'am.

18:40.556 --> 18:41.740
Can you tell me where the fire is?

18:41.765 --> 18:43.172
4663 Tucker Street.

18:43.197 --> 18:44.962
Y'all need to send somebody out here.

18:44.987 --> 18:47.082
Yes, ma'am, they're already on the way.

18:55.634 --> 18:58.501
Oh, bless your hearts for
getting here so quick.

18:58.526 --> 19:00.995
I'm Ellen. Oh, bless your hearts.

19:01.020 --> 19:02.604
And, uh...

19:02.802 --> 19:04.003
Okay, then.

19:04.028 --> 19:06.628
Oh, well, the good Lord
sure took his sweet time

19:06.653 --> 19:07.813
with you, didn't he?

19:07.838 --> 19:10.333
- You called in a fire, ma'am?
- It's right over here.

19:10.816 --> 19:12.486
Oh, you know, these people

19:12.511 --> 19:15.147
do not respect our country's laws.

19:15.172 --> 19:18.852
I guess we can't expect 'em
to respect our city's either.

19:18.877 --> 19:20.250
It's right back here.

19:20.467 --> 19:21.955
"These people"?

19:21.980 --> 19:23.969
There, see? I told you.

19:23.994 --> 19:26.424
They're putting the whole
darn community at risk.

19:26.449 --> 19:27.962
What is that, septic?

19:27.987 --> 19:30.263
Hell, septic never smelled so good.

19:30.288 --> 19:31.797
That's barbacoa.

19:31.822 --> 19:33.709
What the hell's barbacoa?

19:33.734 --> 19:35.764
It's a steak that you cook underground.

19:35.803 --> 19:38.049
- Oof.
- Ooh!

19:39.414 --> 19:40.875
You cook meat in the dirt here?

19:40.900 --> 19:42.135
- That's a thing?
- Yeah.

19:42.160 --> 19:43.828
That's a thing, Mr. Open-minded.

19:43.853 --> 19:45.848
Aw, hell no, Ellen.

19:45.873 --> 19:47.543
Who'd you call this
time, you crazy lady?

19:47.568 --> 19:48.821
Ooh, you better call the police.

19:48.846 --> 19:50.128
That man is unstable.

19:50.153 --> 19:52.284
I'm unstable? You're unstable.

19:52.309 --> 19:54.442
Whoa, whoa, I think we have
a misunderstanding here.

19:54.467 --> 19:55.844
No, I don't misunderstand anything.

19:55.869 --> 19:57.545
She may look like a sweet old lady,

19:57.570 --> 19:58.806
but she's an evil racist.

19:58.831 --> 20:00.194
Who you calling old?

20:00.219 --> 20:01.967
Really? That's the part that upset you?

20:01.992 --> 20:04.823
I am not a racist. My
gardener is Spanish.

20:04.848 --> 20:06.210
She called the cops on us last week

20:06.235 --> 20:07.498
at my daughter's tenth birthday.

20:07.523 --> 20:09.237
They were waving around a bat.

20:09.262 --> 20:11.069
At a piÃ±ata, you twisted vieja.

20:11.094 --> 20:13.237
Yes, I called the police,
and I'm gonna keep calling

20:13.262 --> 20:14.577
till somebody does something.

20:14.602 --> 20:15.639
You know what?

20:16.056 --> 20:18.044
You don't have to call
the police anymore

20:18.069 --> 20:19.970
'cause I'm making a citizen's arrest.

20:19.995 --> 20:21.037
Oh, good.

20:21.062 --> 20:22.332
Put your hands behind your back.

20:22.357 --> 20:23.411
What? Me?

20:23.436 --> 20:25.872
- TK, get the cuffs.
- We don't have any cuffs, Cap.

20:25.897 --> 20:28.843
Oh, I'm sure we could,
uh, find some zip ties.

20:28.868 --> 20:30.421
Oh, that'll work just fine.

20:30.446 --> 20:31.880
- Probie?
- On it.

20:31.905 --> 20:33.920
Wait, now, hold on. I'm
an American citizen.

20:33.945 --> 20:35.179
Which is why you should know

20:35.204 --> 20:37.315
that making a nuisance 9-1-1
call is against the law.

20:37.340 --> 20:39.505
Paul, call APD. Tell 'em
we're on our way down.

20:39.530 --> 20:40.848
Yep.

20:41.769 --> 20:43.003
Boom.

20:43.028 --> 20:45.256
- I-I...
- Ma'am?

20:45.281 --> 20:46.768
- Uh-oh.
- My heart.

20:46.793 --> 20:48.266
- Ma'am, are you all right?
- Dear Jesus.

20:48.291 --> 20:49.705
Cap, we can't take her to jail
if she's having a heart attack.

20:49.730 --> 20:51.829
I know. Marjan, take her BP.

20:51.854 --> 20:52.932
On it, Cap.

20:52.957 --> 20:54.184
Maybe give her some mouth-to-mouth.

20:54.209 --> 20:56.046
No! Not her.

20:56.071 --> 20:58.495
So maybe you're not
having a heart attack?

20:58.520 --> 21:00.708
I am. I definitely am!

21:00.733 --> 21:03.125
- Can't you do it?
- Not certified.

21:03.150 --> 21:04.976
Oh. How about him?

21:05.001 --> 21:08.045
Sure, ma'am, but just so you
know, I am a homosexual.

21:08.070 --> 21:09.259
Oh.

21:10.363 --> 21:11.565
No.

21:11.590 --> 21:13.524
He can do it.

21:14.392 --> 21:16.786
I told you I am not a racist!

21:20.614 --> 21:22.316
You're not a homosexual, are you?

21:22.341 --> 21:23.477
Oh, no, ma'am.

21:23.502 --> 21:25.411
But I am trans, though.

21:30.796 --> 21:32.442
Take me to jail.

22:01.632 --> 22:03.904
Oh, my God, that was...

22:04.253 --> 22:06.402
You're really good at that.

22:06.427 --> 22:10.067
Yeah, you're... you're
not so bad yourself.

22:12.128 --> 22:14.626
Wow, you're not even
gonna catch your breath?

22:15.083 --> 22:16.953
I got a shift.

22:17.199 --> 22:19.402
36 minutes to go 8 miles?

22:19.427 --> 22:22.265
Jeez, I thought I left the
crazy traffic in Manhattan.

22:22.290 --> 22:24.392
Hey, why don't we go for round two

22:24.417 --> 22:25.636
and then I can drive you?

22:25.661 --> 22:27.959
I can flip on the light-bar and siren.

22:27.984 --> 22:32.784
You're sweet and... very
hot, but I kind of just like

22:32.809 --> 22:35.486
to zone out and listen to
music before work, so...

22:36.323 --> 22:38.116
Totally.

22:39.794 --> 22:41.102
Text me.

23:02.390 --> 23:03.858
Michelle.

23:06.494 --> 23:08.329
You can't escape that easy.

23:14.515 --> 23:16.219
Listen, full disclosure,

23:16.244 --> 23:19.074
I don't really believe
in any of this stuff.

23:19.099 --> 23:21.249
But at this point, I'm
willing to try anything,

23:21.274 --> 23:23.103
no matter how irrational it is.

23:23.128 --> 23:25.622
Drink... for a broken heart.

23:35.824 --> 23:37.370
Light them, please.

23:57.812 --> 23:59.716
You say you want to find your sister?

23:59.741 --> 24:00.942
Yes.

24:00.967 --> 24:02.412
But why?

24:02.437 --> 24:04.602
Because I love her more than life.

24:04.873 --> 24:06.690
'Cause I haven't had a
decent night of sleep

24:06.715 --> 24:08.036
in three years.

24:11.852 --> 24:14.276
Red is the candle for love,

24:14.301 --> 24:17.324
but the flame on the
black is just as high.

24:17.349 --> 24:20.768
Black symbolizes curses, anger.

24:20.793 --> 24:23.347
Maybe your room's drafty.

24:25.018 --> 24:27.417
The skinny lady will
give you what you want

24:27.442 --> 24:30.260
but only if you're honest
about why you seek it.

24:30.439 --> 24:34.258
Oh, is this the part where you
ask me for another 200 bucks?

24:35.350 --> 24:38.583
This is the part where you
need to be truthful with me

24:38.608 --> 24:40.878
about your feelings for your sister.

24:43.800 --> 24:46.075
Who doesn't have complicated feelings

24:46.100 --> 24:47.965
about their sister?

24:48.167 --> 24:50.949
Iris was always the sunshine child.

24:51.520 --> 24:54.092
I won district in track.

24:54.117 --> 24:55.519
She won state.

24:56.984 --> 24:59.735
I was certified as an EMT, and...

25:00.020 --> 25:02.592
and she went to medical school.

25:02.917 --> 25:05.572
But she thought she knew everything.

25:05.597 --> 25:06.785
I told her that she should

25:06.810 --> 25:09.995
dump her loser boyfriend
before he ruined her life.

25:11.814 --> 25:14.040
It was the last time I spoke to her.

25:20.883 --> 25:23.015
So yeah, you can tell the skinny lady

25:23.040 --> 25:25.335
that I'm fueled by anger too.

25:29.878 --> 25:31.586
How did you do that?

25:31.611 --> 25:33.114
I did nothing.

25:33.139 --> 25:36.484
But anger expressed is
often anger extinguished.

25:40.284 --> 25:43.479
Now, what I'm about to tell
you may sound silly...

25:43.504 --> 25:45.912
Irrational, as you say...

25:45.937 --> 25:47.588
But if you wish to find Iris,

25:47.616 --> 25:49.851
you will do exactly as I say.

25:50.023 --> 25:51.337
Understand?

25:56.057 --> 25:57.460
I understand.

26:30.445 --> 26:31.914
Cap.

26:32.347 --> 26:35.582
Damn, son, somebody get me my shades!

26:35.607 --> 26:38.449
Nice chrome dome, buddy!

26:38.474 --> 26:40.462
Oh, sweet God. Is that my future?

26:40.794 --> 26:42.421
Hey, Lex, you looking for Superman?

26:42.446 --> 26:43.630
He just left.

26:43.655 --> 26:45.671
You gonna make the probie
shine that thing up too?

26:45.696 --> 26:46.884
Hey, I'd be happy to, Cap.

26:46.909 --> 26:48.560
I don't even think it
looks that terrible.

26:48.585 --> 26:50.627
Wait a minute, you told
me I'd look good bald.

26:50.652 --> 26:52.509
Well, you've certainly
gone out of your way

26:52.534 --> 26:53.782
to prove me wrong.

27:00.502 --> 27:02.096
Help! Please!

27:02.121 --> 27:03.822
Help me, please!

27:03.847 --> 27:05.190
Okay, hang on. We're coming.

27:05.215 --> 27:06.215
Hurry!

27:06.240 --> 27:07.478
I'll get you out of there.

27:07.689 --> 27:09.818
Oh, thank God.

27:09.843 --> 27:11.715
You're my knight in shining armor.

27:12.425 --> 27:14.233
Grab my arm.

27:14.828 --> 27:17.324
You know what? I'm good.

27:17.349 --> 27:18.572
What?

27:18.597 --> 27:20.501
I'll just stay here.

27:20.526 --> 27:21.732
You'll die.

27:21.757 --> 27:23.365
I'm okay with that.

27:23.390 --> 27:25.074
You're being irrational.

27:25.099 --> 27:27.046
Have you seen yourself?

27:28.601 --> 27:30.066
Oh!

27:31.266 --> 27:33.332
Dad, you okay?

27:33.709 --> 27:36.804
Yeah. Go back to sleep.

27:50.738 --> 27:53.483
Oof, God help me.

27:57.765 --> 28:00.169
It's easy to be hard-boiled about it

28:00.194 --> 28:03.239
in the daytime, but
night's another thing.

28:03.264 --> 28:05.095
Hemingway fan.

28:05.120 --> 28:06.624
Me too.

28:07.873 --> 28:10.600
What's got you up tonight, Captain?

28:10.784 --> 28:13.402
I think Paul's chicken
Vesuvius didn't agree with me.

28:15.069 --> 28:16.683
It must be quite the indigestion

28:16.708 --> 28:19.292
to have you calling
out to the Almighty.

28:21.683 --> 28:23.279
Come on.

28:23.624 --> 28:27.225
What's said between captains
stays between captains.

28:28.673 --> 28:30.091
It's dumb.

28:30.644 --> 28:35.114
It's embarrassingly, outrageously dumb.

28:35.139 --> 28:37.498
How 'bout you let me
be the judge of that?

28:40.395 --> 28:45.492
I had a night terror...
about losing my hair.

28:45.517 --> 28:48.574
Mm, there it is. Come
on, let me have it.

28:49.544 --> 28:51.124
Go on.

28:51.806 --> 28:53.344
I have a medical issue.

28:53.369 --> 28:55.376
It should be fine, but it prevents me

28:55.401 --> 28:58.135
from... getting my hair treatments.

28:58.539 --> 29:01.421
I told you I thought
you'd look good bald.

29:01.446 --> 29:03.960
That's not what you said in the dream.

29:03.985 --> 29:06.791
You know, I've never been
scared of anything on the job

29:06.816 --> 29:08.459
as much as I am of this.

29:08.484 --> 29:10.727
I mean, I hate the fact
that I'm so concerned

29:10.752 --> 29:11.919
with my signature look.

29:11.944 --> 29:14.280
And it's totally irrational, I know,

29:14.305 --> 29:17.560
but I... can't help it.

29:18.447 --> 29:20.413
It sounds pretty human to me.

29:21.108 --> 29:24.230
You wanna have control
of something you can't.

29:24.255 --> 29:26.431
I think we all want that.

29:26.821 --> 29:30.268
In this case, it's time,

29:30.486 --> 29:32.336
your mortality.

29:34.639 --> 29:37.078
You don't wanna be an aging sex symbol.

29:37.103 --> 29:40.016
If you ask me, it's pretty rational.

29:40.041 --> 29:41.584
You think I'm an aging sex symbol?

29:41.609 --> 29:43.459
Shut up.

29:43.484 --> 29:46.767
It's more rational
than what I did today.

29:48.270 --> 29:51.352
I went to see a curandera.

29:51.377 --> 29:52.712
You're joking.

29:52.737 --> 29:54.447
You have no idea what that is, do you?

29:54.472 --> 29:55.637
Not the slightest bit.

29:55.662 --> 29:58.428
It's sort of like a...

29:58.453 --> 30:01.471
Well, a cross between a
witch and a therapist,

30:01.496 --> 30:02.854
I guess.

30:02.941 --> 30:04.881
I'm trying to find my sister.

30:04.906 --> 30:06.156
Your sister?

30:06.284 --> 30:08.569
She disappeared three years ago.

30:10.290 --> 30:11.653
I'm sorry.

30:12.612 --> 30:14.999
So you went and saw a psychic?

30:15.024 --> 30:16.950
Basically, yeah.

30:17.196 --> 30:20.421
She just gave me a spell
to help me find Iris.

30:20.446 --> 30:21.801
Like a magic spell?

30:23.422 --> 30:29.082
She told me to burn a $100
bill under Iris' picture

30:29.107 --> 30:33.182
while I take a bath in sage, bergamot,

30:33.207 --> 30:36.017
uh, lavender, and chamomile.

30:36.042 --> 30:37.789
I don't even know what bergamot is.

30:37.814 --> 30:38.975
It's a citrus.

30:39.000 --> 30:41.064
So if nothing else, you're
gonna smell wonderful.

30:42.671 --> 30:43.734
Look, maybe if you've been

30:43.759 --> 30:45.086
looking for your sister this long,

30:45.111 --> 30:48.255
changing it up is the most
rational thing you can do.

30:48.297 --> 30:49.701
Maybe.

30:52.542 --> 30:55.003
Still all sounds pretty insane to me.

31:00.604 --> 31:04.527
Hey, you tell anybody
what I told you tonight,

31:04.716 --> 31:06.150
you die.

31:06.175 --> 31:07.833
Likewise.

31:09.926 --> 31:11.305
Night, Captain.

31:15.526 --> 31:18.376
I've got to get over myself.

31:26.791 --> 31:28.483
Methane's over 100,000 PPMs.

31:28.508 --> 31:30.069
We are one spark away

31:30.094 --> 31:32.072
from the biggest barbecue
in Texas history.

31:32.097 --> 31:33.302
Let's move fast.

31:33.327 --> 31:35.328
Get every apartment cleared out.

31:35.612 --> 31:37.047
Excuse me, ma'am. Right here.

31:37.072 --> 31:38.216
Come here. I'm gonna
take you over here.

31:38.241 --> 31:39.269
Come on.

31:40.691 --> 31:41.907
Let's go, folks. Game over.

31:41.932 --> 31:43.088
- Yo, what?
- Gotta evacuate.

31:43.113 --> 31:44.871
Hey, I said we gotta go.
We gotta evacuate.

31:44.896 --> 31:46.806
- Let's go now. Now!
- All right, we're going.

31:46.831 --> 31:48.458
- Bro, let's go. Come on.
- Okay, okay.

31:48.483 --> 31:50.112
- Okay, we're going.
- To the left.

31:50.137 --> 31:52.081
Come in.

31:52.681 --> 31:54.210
Sorry, sir, you need to come with us.

31:54.235 --> 31:56.142
Apartment's under evacuation.

31:56.167 --> 31:57.807
Can you help me with my girls?

31:57.832 --> 32:00.429
Oh, I'm actually allergic to cats.

32:03.536 --> 32:05.350
Howard Dalton, you in there?

32:05.375 --> 32:08.035
Austin FD. There's a gas
leak in your building.

32:08.060 --> 32:09.533
Everybody needs to leave.

32:09.558 --> 32:11.139
Nice try.

32:14.057 --> 32:16.242
Sir, this is a mandatory evacuation.

32:16.267 --> 32:18.512
- I told you to go away!
- Tough.

32:19.853 --> 32:22.297
Sir, I need you to listen to me.

32:22.322 --> 32:23.903
An air-conditioning unit so much as

32:23.928 --> 32:25.871
clicks on in this place,
and we could all die.

32:26.742 --> 32:29.165
The overlords sent you, didn't they?

32:29.190 --> 32:30.826
To stop the resistance.

32:32.983 --> 32:35.696
Okay, look, I'm not sure
what you're talking about,

32:35.721 --> 32:37.378
but I really need you to...

32:37.403 --> 32:38.955
- Don't play games with me!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

32:38.980 --> 32:40.361
I know what you're trying to do.

32:40.386 --> 32:42.396
You wanna lure me outside, huh?

32:42.421 --> 32:44.149
So the snipers can take me out!

32:44.174 --> 32:47.183
I'm not with the overlords, sir.

32:48.263 --> 32:49.502
Get out.

32:49.527 --> 32:50.862
- Okay, getting out.
- Get out!

32:50.887 --> 32:52.364
Getting out! Getting out!

32:54.257 --> 32:56.236
The guy just refuses to leave, sir.

32:57.880 --> 32:59.235
The guy's a total wack job, Cap.

32:59.260 --> 33:00.762
We just can't leave him in there.

33:00.787 --> 33:02.082
Did I mention the gun?

33:02.107 --> 33:03.242
Dad, you're not gonna pull him out

33:03.267 --> 33:05.355
of his paranoid, irrational fantasy.

33:05.380 --> 33:07.248
So maybe we step inside with him.

33:10.645 --> 33:12.152
Who is it?

33:12.668 --> 33:14.510
We're with the resistance.

33:20.235 --> 33:22.180
We need to get you out
of here right now.

33:22.205 --> 33:25.455
Put this on. They have eyes everywhere.

33:29.325 --> 33:32.628
The other way. Other way.

33:33.035 --> 33:35.518
There you go. Keep your head down, sir.

33:35.651 --> 33:39.723
Resistance, this is Alpha Team.
Are we clear for retrieval?

33:39.748 --> 33:42.117
Uh, that's a big 10-4.

33:42.142 --> 33:44.206
The overlords are looking
the other way, Cap.

33:51.649 --> 33:54.287
No, no, I forgot my O-Locator.

33:54.312 --> 33:55.334
We have to go back.

33:55.359 --> 33:56.393
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

33:56.418 --> 33:58.230
Well, I need it to
identify the overlords.

33:58.255 --> 34:00.312
'Cause I... without it,
they could be anywhere,

34:00.337 --> 34:01.788
taking the form of anything!

34:01.813 --> 34:02.885
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

34:05.308 --> 34:07.429
Detecting overlord vibrations.

34:12.141 --> 34:13.746
They're coming from
inside the apartment.

34:13.771 --> 34:15.446
Move! Move, move, move.

34:19.042 --> 34:21.592
- We made it!
- Sure did.

34:31.127 --> 34:33.752
The resistance will be forever grateful

34:33.777 --> 34:35.224
for what you did today.

34:50.819 --> 34:53.251
My Uncle Grant owns this place.

34:53.275 --> 34:55.828
I spent my summers here just bowhunting

34:55.853 --> 34:59.256
and branding cattle and
cleaning out the stables,

34:59.281 --> 35:00.879
clearing brush.

35:01.878 --> 35:04.185
Yeah, you didn't get a
lot of cuddles as a kid.

35:06.717 --> 35:08.382
What do you say, Tico?

35:08.407 --> 35:09.713
Hey, what's up, Judd?

35:09.738 --> 35:11.187
You ever ride before, Cap?

35:11.212 --> 35:12.275
Yeah, a little bit.

35:12.300 --> 35:13.815
Now can you tell me why you brought me

35:13.840 --> 35:15.137
all the way out here?

35:17.086 --> 35:18.657
No, I cannot.

35:18.682 --> 35:20.628
There goes the better
part of my morning.

35:20.653 --> 35:21.840
Now let's mount up.

35:28.385 --> 35:30.453
You're not gonna make me
chew "tobaccer" or anything,

35:30.478 --> 35:31.478
are you?

35:33.293 --> 35:34.520
No, sir.

35:34.545 --> 35:37.205
- Whoo! Git! Whoo!
- Whoo!

35:48.998 --> 35:50.411
Fun, ain't it, Cap?

35:50.436 --> 35:51.814
Pretty damn great.

36:03.025 --> 36:04.836
We'll pull up right here.

36:05.608 --> 36:08.025
Whoa. Good boy.

36:09.251 --> 36:10.970
Wow, something else.

36:12.134 --> 36:13.832
Hey, you feel that?

36:13.857 --> 36:17.078
Your heart rate starts going.
You got the wind in your face.

36:17.103 --> 36:19.079
And there ain't room to
think about anything else

36:19.104 --> 36:20.939
except for what you're
feeling right now.

36:20.964 --> 36:22.514
Yeah.

36:22.992 --> 36:25.834
My Uncle Cash likes to say
that the secret to life

36:25.859 --> 36:27.922
isn't thinking less of yourself

36:27.947 --> 36:29.663
but thinking of yourself less.

36:29.688 --> 36:32.376
Uncle Cash sounds like he knows
what he's talking about.

36:33.090 --> 36:35.467
He's a salty old drunk with cirrhosis,

36:35.492 --> 36:37.804
but the point is,

36:38.007 --> 36:40.528
you got to hold on to
what matters in life.

36:41.564 --> 36:43.694
It don't matter if you lose your hair.

36:43.719 --> 36:45.226
Yeah.

36:45.251 --> 36:47.683
You gotta do what you
gotta do to stay alive,

36:47.708 --> 36:50.263
and if it comes to it,

36:50.288 --> 36:52.747
it's Texas.

36:52.882 --> 36:55.186
Now we know you look
good in a cowboy hat.

36:56.693 --> 36:58.060
You should keep it.

37:07.495 --> 37:09.089
- Hey.
- Hi.

37:12.182 --> 37:13.460
Ah, it's like that, huh?

37:13.485 --> 37:14.830
You don't like it a little rough?

37:16.140 --> 37:19.506
Oh, oh, just take a breath, tiger.

37:19.531 --> 37:21.499
What? You're the one that
called me to come over.

37:21.524 --> 37:22.540
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

37:22.565 --> 37:25.012
I-I did.

37:34.975 --> 37:38.085
I know it looks like a lot of work.

37:40.935 --> 37:43.031
Don't worry. It wasn't.

37:46.497 --> 37:49.178
None for me, thanks.

37:49.589 --> 37:52.193
Sorry, should've asked.

37:54.059 --> 37:56.939
The food will be ready soon.

37:57.836 --> 37:59.709
Now, the guy at the market told me

37:59.734 --> 38:03.386
that this red snapper was fresh, so...

38:05.406 --> 38:07.703
Damn, you don't like fish.

38:09.288 --> 38:11.718
This feels like a...
like a whole thing.

38:12.845 --> 38:14.335
A whole thing?

38:15.562 --> 38:17.628
- You mean dinner?
- No.

38:17.653 --> 38:20.610
It's just, I thought that we
were clear about everything.

38:20.635 --> 38:24.225
I'm not looking for... for this.

38:24.838 --> 38:28.301
Well... I'm sorry,

38:28.326 --> 38:32.166
but I don't do this a lot.

38:33.011 --> 38:34.221
Clearly.

38:34.641 --> 38:37.631
I don't think it's a big ask
to have an actual conversation

38:37.656 --> 38:39.369
before we hook up.

38:39.394 --> 38:41.399
Well, it's a little late
for that, don't you think?

38:41.660 --> 38:43.523
Look, I just got out of a relationship.

38:43.548 --> 38:45.161
I'm not looking to jump into another...

38:45.199 --> 38:46.318
It's a meal,

38:47.339 --> 38:49.370
not a marriage proposal, TK.

38:51.392 --> 38:54.252
What, did I just step
into something or...

38:56.797 --> 38:59.300
Wait, are... are you... are
you serious right now?

38:59.325 --> 39:02.708
Dude, you invited me over
here after midnight.

39:02.733 --> 39:04.354
What do you want me to say?

39:04.379 --> 39:05.634
Yeah...

39:06.045 --> 39:07.859
after both our shifts.

39:10.367 --> 39:12.766
Why are you being so crazy?

39:13.759 --> 39:15.092
I...

39:19.652 --> 39:21.962
I'm sorry for the misunderstanding.

39:26.572 --> 39:28.260
You ready?

39:28.295 --> 39:29.363
Hell no.

39:29.388 --> 39:30.628
Okay.

39:37.138 --> 39:38.404
Come on.

39:44.585 --> 39:45.904
One.

39:46.412 --> 39:49.211
Dispatch, this place is
going up like a tinderbox.

39:50.258 --> 39:51.258
Two.

39:51.283 --> 39:53.120
Harkes, we need more pressure.

39:53.145 --> 39:54.638
Y'all hold on tight!

39:54.663 --> 39:55.725
Three.

39:55.750 --> 39:58.140
Whoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo!

39:58.411 --> 39:59.665
Four.

39:59.690 --> 40:01.586
Come in, 126. Do you copy?

40:01.642 --> 40:04.141
126, fall back!

40:04.418 --> 40:05.819
Four.

40:05.844 --> 40:09.012
126, fall back!

40:11.637 --> 40:12.850
Five.

40:13.907 --> 40:16.159
Ah.

40:19.531 --> 40:21.076
How do you feel?

40:21.113 --> 40:22.349
Uh...

40:24.190 --> 40:27.262
I feel like the tiniest
weight in the world

40:27.287 --> 40:28.540
just got lifted off my chest.

40:28.565 --> 40:29.941
But that's it, you know?

40:29.966 --> 40:32.504
That's all.

40:32.529 --> 40:34.119
Oh, man.

40:34.144 --> 40:36.275
Judd Ryder, do you have any idea

40:36.300 --> 40:38.782
how proud I am of you?

40:38.807 --> 40:41.107
No.

41:32.984 --> 41:34.453
This is so dumb.

41:36.927 --> 41:39.181
Why do I get the feeling
you're somewhere

41:39.206 --> 41:40.800
laughing at me, you jerk?

41:44.459 --> 41:46.261
I miss you so much.

41:52.060 --> 41:54.028
Oh, screw it.

42:45.678 --> 42:47.481
Yee-haw!
