01:17.708 --> 01:18.875
Angela.

01:24.541 --> 01:25.416
Yeah.

01:26.250 --> 01:28.166
You going to help me load this or not?

01:28.791 --> 01:31.083
Jackson, you better help load up.

01:31.166 --> 01:33.083
Yes, I will, I will.

01:33.791 --> 01:35.208
Go, go help them.

01:39.833 --> 01:41.458
Be careful with that, Jackson.

01:46.208 --> 01:48.083
- Ange, can you grab my purse?
- Be careful.

01:48.166 --> 01:49.958
El, relax. Uni's got insurance.

01:50.041 --> 01:52.500
But we still gotta get it
back on Monday in one piece.

01:52.583 --> 01:54.041
Thanks.

01:57.750 --> 01:58.666
Elliot!

01:58.750 --> 02:00.583
Let's go. Time is money.

02:11.833 --> 02:13.708
Jackson. We spoke on the phone.

02:13.791 --> 02:15.041
Pleased to meet you.

02:15.125 --> 02:17.000
So, yeah. This is...

02:17.083 --> 02:17.958
Angela.

02:18.416 --> 02:20.333
- My sister.
- Of course.

02:20.916 --> 02:22.250
The one with the gift.

02:22.750 --> 02:23.875
Yeah.

02:24.666 --> 02:27.166
I read what you did
for that family in The Herald.

02:31.208 --> 02:34.333
Yeah. There she goes, she can feel it.

02:35.208 --> 02:37.041
- There's something.
- Yeah.

02:42.958 --> 02:44.083
Hi, there.

02:44.333 --> 02:46.375
It's okay, darling. You can say hello.

02:46.541 --> 02:47.416
Hello.

02:48.166 --> 02:49.625
We're gonna talk to your mom.

02:50.541 --> 02:52.250
And we're gonna get her back to heaven.

02:53.958 --> 02:55.666
We're gonna make everything all right.

02:57.083 --> 02:58.000
El...

03:00.333 --> 03:03.125
Elliot, it's not working.

03:04.625 --> 03:05.958
Hang on a bit.

03:11.000 --> 03:12.166
Should be up.

03:13.541 --> 03:14.416
Try now.

03:15.958 --> 03:17.041
Yep, got it, El.

03:18.666 --> 03:21.666
Did she have any nicknames? Pet names?

03:22.375 --> 03:24.000
Maddy.

03:27.541 --> 03:29.166
Everyone called her Maddy.

03:33.041 --> 03:34.708
What's that? What's he doing?

03:34.791 --> 03:38.333
It's an EMF meter
measuring electromagnetic fields.

03:39.958 --> 03:41.208
Are you getting anything?

03:41.625 --> 03:45.041
Definitely. Especially
in the basement. Really hot down there.

03:49.625 --> 03:52.208
She used to spend
all of her time down there.

03:54.666 --> 03:57.625
We're running a tailoring business
out of the house for years.

03:59.958 --> 04:02.458
I'm sorry.
It's just been really hard for us.

04:05.875 --> 04:07.291
Susie especially.

04:12.375 --> 04:13.833
How long has it been for you?

04:16.333 --> 04:17.208
Since your mom?

04:20.375 --> 04:22.000
Five years,

04:23.041 --> 04:24.000
this December.

04:26.333 --> 04:27.541
Must be very difficult.

04:30.375 --> 04:31.375
Yeah.

04:40.666 --> 04:43.125
Okay, Angela, I'm gonna send you in.

04:43.750 --> 04:46.291
Take your time.
Remember, you need to be thorough.

04:46.583 --> 04:47.500
Got it.

04:47.916 --> 04:49.958
Any trouble, we're right here.

04:51.083 --> 04:52.083
Stop it.

04:55.125 --> 04:56.041
Sell it.

04:58.541 --> 04:59.916
We filming something today?

05:08.166 --> 05:09.166
You okay?

05:11.958 --> 05:13.041
Are you on something?

05:13.583 --> 05:14.875
You are.

05:16.958 --> 05:18.500
Let's get this over with.

06:04.541 --> 06:05.541
Maddy?

06:10.250 --> 06:11.083
Maddy?

06:21.458 --> 06:23.500
My name is Angela Sayers.

06:28.250 --> 06:30.208
Your husband Frank, he called me here.

06:40.625 --> 06:43.583
I've come to see if you'd consider
leaving this house.

06:47.250 --> 06:48.791
Your husband, your daughter...

06:49.458 --> 06:52.583
they miss you so much,
but they need to move on.

07:13.333 --> 07:15.333
Frank? Susie?

07:18.291 --> 07:19.333
Did you hear that?

07:21.375 --> 07:24.083
You heard that, right?

07:29.916 --> 07:31.208
Is she... is she there?

07:32.458 --> 07:33.333
Can she see her?

07:35.708 --> 07:38.083
It's an auditory gift.

07:39.958 --> 07:41.291
Frank, now please.

07:42.416 --> 07:43.583
Goodbye.

07:47.208 --> 07:48.333
She's gone.

07:48.541 --> 07:50.791
- She's at peace.
- There it is.

07:51.541 --> 07:54.958
- Maddy has left the house.
- My God, Jackson.

07:56.416 --> 07:57.958
You could just pay Beth.

07:58.291 --> 08:01.416
And, I have to check on my sister now.
This...

08:02.458 --> 08:05.375
- This really takes a toll on her powers.
- Yeah.

08:05.916 --> 08:06.875
Yeah, of course.

09:10.416 --> 09:11.250
Ange...

09:11.875 --> 09:12.750
you okay?

09:13.791 --> 09:14.875
What happened?

09:21.791 --> 09:23.208
You can stop.

09:43.166 --> 09:45.208
To the Scots...

09:45.958 --> 09:47.500
and their haunted land.

09:59.625 --> 10:02.500
Show Elliot the ad
you've been working on. The flyer.

10:02.583 --> 10:03.750
Yeah. Yeah.

10:06.708 --> 10:12.041
"From tragedy to triumph.
Angela inherited her mother's gift."

10:14.375 --> 10:17.333
I don't know. What would you want me
to say about it, Jackson?

10:18.166 --> 10:20.083
We are gonna take this place over.

10:20.500 --> 10:22.666
I thought we were losing
the mom-daughter thing.

10:22.750 --> 10:24.208
Why, because Ange wanted to?

10:25.708 --> 10:27.833
Look, yeah,
but I'm in this for the filmmaking.

10:28.458 --> 10:30.958
What do you wanna do?
Wanna go off to Hollywood?

10:31.041 --> 10:34.583
- No. I think this is bullshit.
- El! Go to Hollywood right now.

10:34.666 --> 10:37.500
We are gonna stay here
and make shitloads of money.

10:37.583 --> 10:40.291
- You're such an asshole.
- Ange, wait up.

10:43.750 --> 10:45.208
Want me to put it on?

10:49.208 --> 10:51.041
You know, earlier in the basement,

10:52.500 --> 10:54.416
you seemed pretty upset.

10:54.875 --> 10:57.291
Yeah, I could kill Jackson.

10:59.000 --> 11:00.708
Could have used a warning
when she attacked.

11:00.791 --> 11:02.958
- When who attacked?
- Come on!

11:03.208 --> 11:04.083
Wh...

11:04.166 --> 11:08.000
What, did you guys sneak in before?
Rig some pulley system to make her move?

11:08.083 --> 11:08.916
No.

11:10.333 --> 11:12.583
I've got no idea
what you're talking about.

11:18.666 --> 11:20.250
Forget it.

11:21.333 --> 11:22.208
You okay?

12:18.000 --> 12:21.000
Dear Mr. Sayers, ...discuss the discharge
of your daughter... in our hospital.

12:21.083 --> 12:23.166
I should be glad to assist
you and your daughter...

12:34.708 --> 12:35.666
Really?

13:00.250 --> 13:01.083
Hello.

13:01.166 --> 13:03.125
Is this the medium service?

13:03.208 --> 13:05.208
It is, yeah.

13:05.333 --> 13:06.958
How soon could you come out?

13:07.875 --> 13:09.166
Where are you located?

13:09.291 --> 13:12.083
Off the A77. The Green Estate.

13:13.000 --> 13:15.416
I cannot get them to stop screaming.

13:15.541 --> 13:17.125
Get who to stop screaming?

13:17.250 --> 13:18.750
The girls.

13:19.375 --> 13:22.166
I can hear them every night.

13:22.666 --> 13:25.916
Okay, we...
We're not available at the moment.

13:26.000 --> 13:29.333
We're quite busy.
So I don't think we can. No, sorry.

13:29.416 --> 13:31.166
I'm sorry.

13:39.375 --> 13:41.333
Follow this simple technique.

13:41.416 --> 13:43.750
Find a quiet place with a mirror

13:43.833 --> 13:46.833
where you will not be interrupted.
Look at yourself,

13:46.916 --> 13:49.291
and focus.

13:56.541 --> 14:00.000
It's a gift. She has a gift.

14:00.083 --> 14:02.625
She has a gift. She has a gift.

14:06.250 --> 14:08.791
Angela, do you see a future in psychology?

14:10.208 --> 14:13.166
You've missed many assignments,
days of class.

14:13.250 --> 14:16.541
Yeah, I haven't been
feeling very well recently.

14:24.375 --> 14:27.541
This is just a little extra money
on the side.

14:28.000 --> 14:30.708
If you're not serious about this program,

14:30.791 --> 14:32.916
another student
will gladly take your place.

14:33.000 --> 14:37.166
No, I am, I've been dealing
with some family stuff.

14:37.250 --> 14:39.416
Have you considered
talking to somebody about it?

14:39.500 --> 14:40.583
Angela.

14:42.333 --> 14:46.041
It's nothing to be ashamed of,
we have excellent school counselors here,

14:46.125 --> 14:48.708
- trained to help.
- I don't want to talk to anyone.

14:48.958 --> 14:50.583
Well...

14:50.666 --> 14:52.708
I can't pass you on good intentions.

14:53.750 --> 14:57.375
Okay, is there something I can do,
any extra work I can do?

14:57.500 --> 15:00.166
How about this?

15:00.250 --> 15:02.416
For starters, show up.

15:03.000 --> 15:05.250
You have potential. Embrace it.

15:05.916 --> 15:09.291
Don't be afraid
to really throw yourself into it.

15:10.291 --> 15:11.791
You might surprise yourself.

15:14.041 --> 15:15.333
- Angela.
- Angela.

15:17.500 --> 15:18.500
Sorry, you have...

15:43.583 --> 15:44.500
Who are you?

15:44.583 --> 15:46.625
Grandpa, you can't joke about that.

15:47.666 --> 15:50.041
Jokes are all I've got left, Angie-pie.

15:51.000 --> 15:52.125
Hey Barney.

15:53.958 --> 15:56.541
How's Grandpa holding up?

15:56.625 --> 15:58.208
Is he remembering to walk you?

15:58.500 --> 16:00.416
Hey, I heard that.

16:02.458 --> 16:04.041
And I heard that.

16:06.541 --> 16:07.750
Is that a no?

16:15.291 --> 16:16.625
Here.

16:18.791 --> 16:20.375
Your gran loved this song.

16:30.083 --> 16:30.916
So...

16:32.750 --> 16:33.791
How's university?

16:36.333 --> 16:37.208
It's good.

16:40.541 --> 16:41.500
It's okay.

16:43.083 --> 16:45.333
So why didn't you bring
any of those wee cakes

16:45.416 --> 16:47.000
you bought the last time?

16:52.541 --> 16:54.875
She was always your favorite subject?

16:57.750 --> 17:01.666
Would you tell my grandson
he still owes me £500, from the last,

17:02.333 --> 17:05.208
get-rich-quick scheme he had?

17:05.833 --> 17:08.875
Confidence is an armor against the world.

17:09.290 --> 17:12.540
A confident man is a successful man.

17:13.540 --> 17:16.375
Tame your mind and master your thoughts.

17:17.165 --> 17:21.040
If you can control your mind,
you can influence others.

17:52.041 --> 17:53.416
What was she like?

17:54.583 --> 17:56.041
Before it all went...

17:59.791 --> 18:01.000
Your mother...

18:02.166 --> 18:03.250
pushed everyone away.

18:05.041 --> 18:07.791
Drove your Gran mad, she was never here.

18:09.708 --> 18:12.416
Went to America, never told anyone.
Started that...

18:13.333 --> 18:14.833
god-forsaken business.

18:17.166 --> 18:18.375
Met your father.

18:18.541 --> 18:20.458
I don't know what happened after that.

18:24.458 --> 18:25.916
So she disappointed you?

18:47.250 --> 18:48.666
It was a nonsense.

18:50.875 --> 18:54.000
Locking herself away for... years.

18:55.125 --> 18:56.125
Talking about...

18:57.375 --> 18:59.916
voices in her head.

19:01.375 --> 19:06.333
Nose bleeds, talking about people
that weren't there.

19:09.041 --> 19:11.625
And then, she has to go and end it.

19:16.666 --> 19:19.250
Your mother was afraid.

19:20.291 --> 19:21.500
If she had...

19:22.750 --> 19:24.166
more strength...

19:25.708 --> 19:27.208
she'd still be here.

20:14.458 --> 20:16.500
Yeah, this is Sayer's Medium Service.

20:17.958 --> 20:19.916
No, we're available.
Who told you that?

20:37.291 --> 20:39.666
- What happened to your face?
- Don't worry about it.

20:39.750 --> 20:41.416
What did you say to that old lady?

20:42.041 --> 20:43.083
Old lady?

20:43.166 --> 20:45.166
Jackson, seriously,
what are you messed up in?

20:45.250 --> 20:47.125
She called back.
Said you turned her down.

20:47.666 --> 20:48.625
I just...

20:49.541 --> 20:51.291
can't, it's too much.

20:52.000 --> 20:54.208
Whatever happened to coming here
being a fresh start?

20:54.291 --> 20:56.000
We're doing the same shit
we did back home.

20:56.083 --> 20:58.000
- You agreed to it.
- Because you made me.

20:58.083 --> 21:00.583
And you said
it was going to be for a little while.

21:00.666 --> 21:03.500
- When's it going to end?
- How do you think we've gotten by?

21:03.583 --> 21:05.041
Fresh starts are not cheap.

21:05.125 --> 21:07.666
We don't have the equipment
to cover a place that big, anyway.

21:09.500 --> 21:12.458
I've been calling El.
He'll have to gear up to sell it. Hey!

21:14.083 --> 21:16.958
We'll cheat it. She sounds ancient.
She won't know the difference.

21:17.041 --> 21:19.333
Scary shit has happened
in that house, Jackson.

21:19.416 --> 21:21.708
- Where?
- Little girls were murdered.

21:21.791 --> 21:23.333
- Little girls?
- Come on!

21:23.416 --> 21:25.916
It's going to be like every other gig.

21:26.791 --> 21:29.125
"My dead kid.

21:29.208 --> 21:30.333
I miss her."

21:30.416 --> 21:32.708
"My dead wife.
She won't leave us alone."

21:32.791 --> 21:36.000
Boo-fuckin'-hoo. All we gotta do

21:36.083 --> 21:38.583
is put on a damn good show
and she sleeps better at night.

21:38.666 --> 21:41.000
- That has nothing to with this.
- What's your issue?

21:42.208 --> 21:45.333
She wants to pay us double our rate.
So she can move on.

21:45.708 --> 21:47.208
It's a no-brainer.

21:47.291 --> 21:49.791
I don't know.
I'm not a hustler like you and mom.

21:50.458 --> 21:51.750
You really wanna go there?

21:53.125 --> 21:55.458
- Jackson...
- Ever since mom killed herself,

21:55.541 --> 21:57.208
all you've done is judge me,

21:57.708 --> 22:00.583
about how I dealt with it
or didn't deal with it.

22:00.666 --> 22:04.916
Mom scratched her eyes out
because she couldn't handle reality.

22:05.000 --> 22:06.875
This is our reality.

22:07.583 --> 22:08.583
She left us shit.

22:08.666 --> 22:11.333
All we got is grandpa who barely knows
what day of the week it is.

22:11.416 --> 22:12.875
He knows how much you owe him.

22:15.791 --> 22:17.625
I've been trying to make this work.

22:18.375 --> 22:19.791
But you don't make it easy.

22:20.875 --> 22:24.625
You think mom was some victim.
She wasn't. She left us, remember?

22:25.583 --> 22:28.000
You better take control
of whatever's spiraling through

22:28.083 --> 22:29.291
your little head right now.

22:29.375 --> 22:33.083
Otherwise, you're gonna end up
a nutbag just like mom.

22:34.958 --> 22:36.791
And we all know how that turned out.

22:38.166 --> 22:39.083
Fuck you.

22:40.750 --> 22:43.000
Ange, please. I need the money.

22:43.083 --> 22:45.875
- We can find another way.
- I can't do it without you.

22:46.625 --> 22:47.958
They're going to kill me.

23:08.416 --> 23:10.125
- What are you doing?
- Going.

23:11.291 --> 23:12.291
Going where?

23:12.958 --> 23:15.416
Back to London. With or without you.

23:16.958 --> 23:17.791
Hey.

23:19.833 --> 23:21.541
Jackson, they know where we live.

23:23.750 --> 23:24.583
I swear.

23:24.958 --> 23:27.958
Please, I pay off Craig
and then we're gone.

23:32.250 --> 23:33.291
I promise.

24:13.000 --> 24:14.416
Angela...

24:22.916 --> 24:23.791
Beth?

24:43.333 --> 24:44.916
I need you...

24:49.416 --> 24:50.333
Hello?

24:54.041 --> 24:55.208
Angela...

25:07.166 --> 25:08.916
I can't find your brother.

25:15.166 --> 25:16.041
Mom.

25:17.416 --> 25:18.250
Angela.

25:41.291 --> 25:42.208
I'm in.

25:57.166 --> 25:58.250
Thank you, baby sis.

27:01.708 --> 27:02.791
This is it.

27:04.083 --> 27:05.125
This is it.

27:41.208 --> 27:42.208
What you looking at?

27:44.333 --> 27:46.208
That's where they found the girls' bodies.

27:47.916 --> 27:50.250
- Where? In that building?
- Elliot, don't point.

27:51.291 --> 27:54.333
Her son left them all
sitting in a circle.

27:55.416 --> 27:57.000
Propped up. Facing each other.

28:08.250 --> 28:11.375
All right. Game faces.
Let's go say hi.

28:26.166 --> 28:29.291
- You must be Jackson.
I am indeed. Mrs. Green, pleasure to...

28:29.375 --> 28:33.458
- Who did that to you?
- Your gardener, he hit me with his locks.

28:34.291 --> 28:36.041
Handsome and funny.

28:36.833 --> 28:38.708
Victor's quite harmless.

28:41.375 --> 28:42.250
Hello.

28:44.125 --> 28:44.958
Angela.

28:46.375 --> 28:49.208
This is Elliot, out technician.

28:49.541 --> 28:53.375
And also Beth. Also very technical.

28:53.458 --> 28:54.333
Come in.

29:21.041 --> 29:22.416
You look very pretty.

29:23.000 --> 29:23.833
Thank you.

29:26.500 --> 29:28.500
Go on. On the table.

29:28.875 --> 29:29.708
Okay.

29:31.208 --> 29:33.125
They're a wee bit under-baked.

29:33.208 --> 29:35.041
That's how my girls liked them.

29:36.625 --> 29:37.791
Girls first.

29:39.375 --> 29:40.375
Thank you.

29:41.750 --> 29:44.041
It's a great place, Mrs. Green.

29:46.375 --> 29:49.541
It was much easier to manage
when my husband was alive.

29:50.875 --> 29:54.250
Then we had a... housekeeper, cook.

29:55.375 --> 29:58.166
- And a landscaper.
- Is it okay, actually,

29:58.250 --> 30:02.833
sorry, if we get this part out of the way,
what we agreed to.

30:07.041 --> 30:08.833
Well, yes. But...

30:09.333 --> 30:11.375
After the job's done, correct?

30:11.458 --> 30:16.708
I'm sorry. lt's kind of awkward,
but, it'd be great to just, sort it.

30:16.791 --> 30:18.791
That's what you say on your flyer.

30:20.666 --> 30:22.125
You've got the flyer, right.

30:24.666 --> 30:27.166
- Where'd you get that?
- You said you heard screaming?

30:30.083 --> 30:31.041
Yes.

30:32.166 --> 30:33.125
Laughter...

30:34.083 --> 30:37.000
to start with. And giggles.

30:37.666 --> 30:38.708
But then...

30:40.500 --> 30:42.666
angry, taunting.

30:46.000 --> 30:48.250
It's been 15 years

30:49.250 --> 30:51.083
since we discovered what Herman...

30:56.041 --> 30:58.375
Is it true that he murdered all the girls?

31:00.416 --> 31:03.500
That was a tragedy, Mrs. Green.

31:04.916 --> 31:07.125
And that's what we're here to help with.

31:07.458 --> 31:09.666
I wish I'd seen the signs earlier.

31:11.708 --> 31:14.125
He was a curious child, my son.

31:14.458 --> 31:15.666
I failed them.

31:17.166 --> 31:18.791
I loved those girls.

31:20.541 --> 31:22.208
It wasn't your fault.

31:25.958 --> 31:28.208
I just want a quiet house.

31:42.041 --> 31:43.333
Um...

31:43.666 --> 31:46.208
Okay, we'll need that one.
Yeah, just put into that...

31:46.291 --> 31:49.666
So, um... I was wondering
if you might have some photos.

31:49.750 --> 31:52.541
- Photos?
- Of the girls, something I could use

31:52.625 --> 31:54.416
- to connect with them.
- I see.

31:54.500 --> 31:58.375
It helps me address them directly.
Forms a better trust.

31:59.541 --> 32:01.458
Here's us, all together.

32:09.916 --> 32:13.416
There's dear Missy. There.

32:13.541 --> 32:16.125
And the tall one, Tammy.

32:17.541 --> 32:18.791
And that's sweet Claire.

32:20.041 --> 32:21.875
She was such a sweet girl.

32:22.625 --> 32:23.750
See the teddy.

32:25.458 --> 32:26.875
Herman gave her that.

32:29.458 --> 32:31.333
She was the first one to go missing.

32:37.416 --> 32:39.208
And that's...

32:44.208 --> 32:47.125
Herman. Yes, my son.

32:51.916 --> 32:54.166
The newspapers called him a monster.

32:54.458 --> 32:55.791
But he was my boy.

33:00.416 --> 33:02.625
Your mind is a powerful thing.

33:02.875 --> 33:05.250
- If you fill it with powerful thoughts...
- Fuck!

33:05.333 --> 33:07.583
...your life will start to change.

33:08.875 --> 33:11.625
You can't always control
what happens in life,

33:12.041 --> 33:15.875
but you can always control
what happens in your mind.

33:17.375 --> 33:21.583
If you can control your mind,
you can control your attitude

33:21.666 --> 33:24.125
and how you handle a situation.

33:24.875 --> 33:28.083
Then you can begin
to control the situation.

33:29.291 --> 33:31.750
Repeat your goal in your mind.

33:32.375 --> 33:33.625
Visualize it.

33:34.000 --> 33:35.208
Make it happen.

33:36.458 --> 33:37.583
Be proactive.

33:37.958 --> 33:42.333
Take charge and remember
that you are amazing.

34:17.250 --> 34:19.791
Mrs. Green says skip
the East Hall due to repairs,

34:19.875 --> 34:21.000
so that helps us,

34:21.083 --> 34:23.666
but we'll need to pick
our staging areas carefully.

34:24.125 --> 34:27.916
Otherwise we'll wind up here till Friday
trying to make this feel legit. Got it?

34:28.000 --> 34:31.125
Okay. so let's just start
with the areas she's comfortable with

34:31.208 --> 34:33.958
- and take it from there.
- Yeah, I'll go hook the mikes up.

34:34.041 --> 34:36.583
- Okay. You got those new voices, right?
- Yeah.

34:40.125 --> 34:41.916
- Beautiful.
- And wait for it.

34:42.000 --> 34:43.833
Mrs. Green.

34:45.041 --> 34:49.041
Love it. All right, so, babe, I'll give
you a tap when it's time to cue Elliot.

34:49.125 --> 34:52.083
We'll start with giggling
and then amp it up from there.

34:58.583 --> 34:59.625
Ange...

35:00.875 --> 35:02.041
your nose is bleeding.

35:04.958 --> 35:05.833
Excuse me.

35:27.291 --> 35:30.291
You're okay. You're okay.

35:45.500 --> 35:47.000
Why are you creeping up on me?

35:47.500 --> 35:48.666
'Cause I'm a creep.

35:54.166 --> 35:55.166
You all right?

35:57.375 --> 35:58.500
What was that?

36:30.666 --> 36:31.541
Ange...

37:06.750 --> 37:08.000
What are you doing?

37:16.416 --> 37:17.833
Ange, what's going on?

37:32.041 --> 37:33.708
Angela.

37:37.958 --> 37:39.000
Ange...

37:40.250 --> 37:41.125
Can you hear me?

37:42.041 --> 37:44.458
What happened? Did she fall?

37:44.541 --> 37:45.500
I'm okay.

37:45.791 --> 37:50.458
She said she heard something,
and then, I don't know if she crashed out.

37:51.708 --> 37:55.000
Maybe... Maybe we should just go, you know?
You know, come back...

37:55.083 --> 37:57.166
- She's said she's fine.
- But she just passed out.

37:57.250 --> 37:59.375
I'm... I'm okay.

37:59.458 --> 38:01.166
Okay, good.

38:02.041 --> 38:03.458
Let's get back to it then.

38:05.666 --> 38:06.833
Do you need anything?

38:08.000 --> 38:11.208
- ... Can I have some water, please?
- Yeah.

38:12.791 --> 38:14.083
El, get the gear.

38:15.291 --> 38:16.375
Get the gear.

38:20.541 --> 38:21.541
Thank you.

38:26.041 --> 38:26.958
Are you all right?

38:31.791 --> 38:33.208
You know I love you, right?

38:35.041 --> 38:36.500
I know I can be a dick but,

38:37.208 --> 38:38.333
I do love you.

38:39.916 --> 38:41.791
Don't forget that. Don't ever forget.

38:44.583 --> 38:45.583
Come on.

38:53.916 --> 38:56.250
Yeah, I'm all plugged in up here, so...

38:57.208 --> 39:00.625
Can I ask how
this is all going to work, exactly?

39:01.166 --> 39:02.583
Yeah, sure.

39:05.041 --> 39:06.208
First,

39:07.000 --> 39:09.416
Angela's going to sweep the house.

39:10.541 --> 39:15.541
That might take some time but when
she establishes a connection and...

39:15.625 --> 39:16.625
Jackson...

39:21.541 --> 39:24.916
Is this your usual routine
for all your clients?

39:27.250 --> 39:28.291
It's not up yet.

39:28.666 --> 39:30.041
Stop the showmanship.

39:32.083 --> 39:34.291
I'll check the wires you were after.

39:35.166 --> 39:36.041
Sure.

39:45.541 --> 39:47.916
Must be lovely
to be working with your sister.

39:48.625 --> 39:51.291
Family together. There's no greater joy.

39:55.250 --> 39:56.125
What's happening?

39:57.833 --> 39:59.166
We're waiting on them.

40:03.583 --> 40:04.583
You saw something.

40:06.708 --> 40:08.250
What is it? What did you see?

40:14.583 --> 40:16.083
I'll believe you if you tell me.

40:20.875 --> 40:21.708
Okay.

40:22.875 --> 40:25.625
The only reason...

40:26.958 --> 40:31.375
I said I'd do this, I like my gadgets,
but when I found out...

40:33.166 --> 40:34.958
you was doing it,
I thought it was pretty cool.

40:36.708 --> 40:39.250
I thought it was pretty cool
to hang out with you.

40:40.833 --> 40:42.625
Is it obvious?

40:43.708 --> 40:45.708
- A little bit.
- Yeah.

40:45.875 --> 40:46.791
A big bit.

40:47.041 --> 40:48.416
Um...

40:49.583 --> 40:51.333
We're ready. All feeds are live.

40:52.125 --> 40:53.125
Okay.

40:53.750 --> 40:54.625
Ready?

40:56.375 --> 40:59.666
Are we filming something today
or not? Can't remember.

40:59.750 --> 41:01.750
Okay. Hold on.

41:08.666 --> 41:10.875
Three little donkeys
went up a tree,

41:11.583 --> 41:14.041
and none of them listened to me.

41:17.458 --> 41:18.291
Okay.

41:18.625 --> 41:20.166
Starting in the north hall.

41:32.333 --> 41:37.375
Ange will normally tell us
exactly the specifics of the voices

41:37.458 --> 41:41.291
- and what she hears.
- Can you see from her face?

41:41.958 --> 41:45.458
I can normally tell.
The girls, if they're talking to her.

41:45.541 --> 41:47.875
They'll be able to tell her
where they are,

41:47.958 --> 41:50.208
they'll lead Ange to them.

41:50.291 --> 41:53.083
And when they've made the connection,

41:53.166 --> 41:58.791
they'll be able to discuss further
what action will be taken.

41:58.875 --> 42:01.041
So that they can leave the house.

42:04.250 --> 42:06.500
- One by one?
- One by one.

42:06.583 --> 42:09.833
That's how she does it.
She'll make contact with each of them

42:09.916 --> 42:13.666
and ask them one by one to leave.

42:48.000 --> 42:48.833
Claire.

42:50.458 --> 42:51.458
Missy.

42:53.583 --> 42:54.458
Tammy.

42:56.750 --> 42:58.375
My name is Angela Sayers.

43:00.916 --> 43:02.916
Mrs. Green has called me here.

43:03.666 --> 43:06.208
I've come to see
if you'd consider leaving this house.

43:42.625 --> 43:43.625
You hear that?

43:45.458 --> 43:46.458
What?

43:55.541 --> 43:56.625
I'll check these out.

44:23.833 --> 44:25.083
Something's here.

44:26.250 --> 44:28.041
Elliot, where's she going?

44:43.333 --> 44:45.333
Who sings for the dead only?

45:00.833 --> 45:01.791
Tammy.

45:03.208 --> 45:04.458
You really don't see her?

45:05.208 --> 45:06.541
I can't see anything.

45:19.208 --> 45:20.833
She wants us to follow her.

45:22.541 --> 45:23.666
Okay.

45:26.500 --> 45:28.041
Where are they going?

45:28.708 --> 45:30.583
Ange, can you sense a presence?

45:31.000 --> 45:32.625
Are they going to the East Wing?

45:33.500 --> 45:35.291
Can we stick to the plan, guys?

45:53.458 --> 45:55.500
Elliot, what's happening?

46:21.500 --> 46:22.583
Ange, you copy?

46:24.083 --> 46:24.958
Turn back.

46:31.541 --> 46:32.375
Tammy?

46:33.583 --> 46:34.791
Where are you?

46:34.875 --> 46:36.833
What are you guys doing over there?

46:40.916 --> 46:41.958
Elliot!

46:42.041 --> 46:43.125
What happened?

46:43.958 --> 46:46.250
- Ange, what's going on?
- Shit!

46:46.333 --> 46:49.958
Jackson, the floor just gave away,
he fell... Shit.

46:50.958 --> 46:52.333
Elliot, can you hear me?

46:52.833 --> 46:54.375
Jackson, he's not answering.

46:55.041 --> 46:56.791
I think he's hurt bad. Okay, Elliot...

46:56.875 --> 46:58.166
- We should go help.
- No.

46:58.250 --> 47:00.375
- This is bad, Jackson...
- I'll go check.

47:01.333 --> 47:03.333
Elliot, talk to me please.

47:10.083 --> 47:11.458
Stay there.

47:22.708 --> 47:24.041
Elliott, can you hear me?

47:25.458 --> 47:26.291
Are you okay?

47:28.791 --> 47:29.708
Elliot?

47:29.791 --> 47:32.208
It's my ankle.
I heard something pop.

47:32.291 --> 47:33.916
Shit! It hurts!

47:40.583 --> 47:43.416
Fuck!

47:44.750 --> 47:47.041
El? El, talk to me.

47:47.625 --> 47:49.875
- Humpty Dumpty...
- Everything's going to be okay.

47:49.958 --> 47:50.791
...sat on a wall,

47:50.875 --> 47:53.166
- Humpty Dumpty had a great fall.
- Jackson's coming.

47:53.333 --> 47:55.583
All the King's horses
and all the King's men...

48:06.666 --> 48:07.916
What are you guys up to?

48:11.791 --> 48:13.583
- El, you alive, man?
- Yes.

48:13.875 --> 48:16.541
I think I'm going to need
to go to hospital though.

48:16.750 --> 48:19.000
We'll get you outtta there.
Just hold tight.

48:19.083 --> 48:20.208
Did you call for help?

48:21.125 --> 48:24.583
We're going to have to carry him up,
all right. We'll just keep going.

48:24.833 --> 48:27.500
- We need to finish this job.
- Jackson.

48:29.583 --> 48:31.500
If we call an ambulance here...

48:31.583 --> 48:33.958
- We're screwed.
- Dammit, Jackson. It's Elliot.

48:35.208 --> 48:36.208
Is El okay?

48:38.750 --> 48:41.500
Can you ask Mrs. Green
if we can find a ladder?

48:43.166 --> 48:44.416
Okay.

48:47.541 --> 48:48.791
And maybe a rope.

48:56.041 --> 48:59.500
- What, you don't trust me?
- The maple tree behind East Hills?

48:59.875 --> 49:01.000
I was 12.

49:01.083 --> 49:03.583
Yeah, well, my knee
still clicks weird when I walk.

49:04.958 --> 49:07.416
This is great. I love working with you.

49:10.000 --> 49:11.125
Hold it.

49:11.625 --> 49:13.791
It's okay. It's okay.

49:17.791 --> 49:20.208
Ew. That's fucked.

49:21.708 --> 49:23.375
At least he wasn't faking it.

49:54.416 --> 49:55.458
Jackson...

49:58.875 --> 50:00.458
The girls were kept down here.

50:26.416 --> 50:27.833
Jesus Christ.

50:38.083 --> 50:39.166
Look at the mouth.

50:39.916 --> 50:41.333
She wanted us to find it.

50:41.791 --> 50:42.791
Who?

50:43.958 --> 50:44.833
Tammy.

50:46.166 --> 50:48.958
And Tammy is...

50:50.416 --> 50:51.250
Okay...

50:52.375 --> 50:53.791
I know this sounds nuts.

50:54.833 --> 50:58.333
But ever since our last gig,
I have been...

50:58.833 --> 51:00.458
seeing things.

51:00.541 --> 51:02.041
Jackson, I'm not joking.

51:02.875 --> 51:04.250
She might be right.

51:05.333 --> 51:08.416
It could even be Herman's ghost,
running around here,

51:08.500 --> 51:11.708
- trying to kill us all off for revenge.
- I saw those girls.

51:12.750 --> 51:15.375
And their mouths are sewn up,
just like the story said.

51:15.458 --> 51:17.375
Ange, it's just a house.

51:18.166 --> 51:21.583
We're in a basement
and someone was doodling on the wall.

51:22.041 --> 51:24.625
- That's all there is to it.
- She led us right here.

51:25.375 --> 51:27.375
It's no coincidence
that we ended up down here.

51:27.458 --> 51:29.083
I don't think it's a coincidence.

51:29.166 --> 51:32.291
I don't think any of this
is a coincidence. Us being in here,

51:32.375 --> 51:34.875
in life, in general,
none of it is a coincidence.

51:34.958 --> 51:36.458
Good talk. Let's get up.

51:43.750 --> 51:45.958
Hey, buddy.
Drop the camera, will you?

51:46.750 --> 51:49.083
- El, drop the camera.
- Jackson.

51:49.875 --> 51:54.000
This is my responsibility.

52:05.041 --> 52:06.166
Okay.

52:09.250 --> 52:10.083
All right.

52:11.041 --> 52:12.333
Let's finish the job.

52:12.625 --> 52:15.708
Fuck you, Jackson,
and fuck this scamming shit.

52:15.791 --> 52:16.666
I'm done.

52:17.625 --> 52:19.541
You've got a serious attitude problem.

52:20.041 --> 52:21.333
I know what I saw.

52:24.041 --> 52:25.708
You've fucking lost it, Ange.

52:26.791 --> 52:28.041
Quit the jokes, Jackson.

52:32.916 --> 52:35.208
You actually believe in this shit now?

52:36.000 --> 52:38.708
Believe in it?
This was all your idea.

52:39.583 --> 52:42.291
If you just stuck to the script
instead of wandering off

52:42.375 --> 52:43.625
like a crazy person...

52:44.041 --> 52:47.416
I'm not crazy.
The girls are real, this is real.

52:47.500 --> 52:49.500
Are you being our friend?

52:49.583 --> 52:51.791
Jackson,
they're trying to tell us something.

52:52.041 --> 52:54.083
- Angela.
- You sound just like Mom.

52:54.166 --> 52:56.000
Well, maybe Mom wasn't crazy either.

52:56.083 --> 52:58.083
Jackson.

53:24.458 --> 53:29.416
Hey. Mrs. Green,
we're just having a slight hiccup.

53:30.750 --> 53:32.750
Nothing to worry about.

53:37.083 --> 53:38.000
Hey.

53:44.250 --> 53:46.041
We're going to cleanse this house.

53:46.458 --> 53:47.416
I promise you.

53:49.541 --> 53:51.375
I'm afraid you have failed.

53:54.500 --> 53:57.875
Mrs. Green, I assure you
we'll be able to get the voices out.

53:58.666 --> 53:59.791
You have my word.

54:00.958 --> 54:02.875
- No way...
- Be quiet.

54:05.541 --> 54:07.583
I really thought you could help me.

54:08.791 --> 54:10.125
It's not real, is it?

54:12.541 --> 54:14.916
Any of it. It's all an act.

54:15.791 --> 54:17.375
Angela's gift.

54:18.750 --> 54:22.291
I thought if you could hear the voices too
you'd be able to stop them.

54:27.041 --> 54:30.083
I want you out of here immediately.

54:32.625 --> 54:33.708
It is real.

54:35.000 --> 54:35.916
Everything.

54:37.250 --> 54:38.416
Everything.

54:39.708 --> 54:42.708
But you can't control the unseen, okay?

54:47.708 --> 54:50.166
I wanted to give them a happy future.

54:50.958 --> 54:52.666
I tried to give them everything.

54:54.291 --> 54:56.500
So that maybe they'd thank me later,

54:57.375 --> 54:59.041
and think of me as their mother.

55:00.083 --> 55:01.708
But they wouldn't listen to me.

55:02.208 --> 55:03.791
They would not be quiet.

55:04.583 --> 55:06.833
Herman was a sweet boy.

55:08.708 --> 55:11.250
The girls were to blame, not him.

55:12.791 --> 55:14.583
Those little monsters...

55:20.750 --> 55:23.583
Beth, pack up. We're getting
the fuck out of here.

55:30.500 --> 55:31.500
It's like...

55:33.750 --> 55:35.500
I don't even think you're a freak.

55:35.875 --> 55:39.541
And I know that everyone at uni

55:40.166 --> 55:42.041
obviously thinks you're a bit weird.

55:43.375 --> 55:45.916
That's kind of something
I always liked about you.

55:47.500 --> 55:48.500
You know...

55:51.083 --> 55:52.708
Ange, pick up.

55:55.541 --> 55:56.375
Jackson.

55:57.750 --> 55:59.458
I'm coming to get you and Elliot.

56:00.583 --> 56:02.166
Beth, we're leaving.

56:02.416 --> 56:03.958
Angela...

56:14.916 --> 56:16.250
Angela.

56:32.416 --> 56:33.375
Beth?

57:37.291 --> 57:38.291
Jackson.

57:50.916 --> 57:52.166
Jackson!

57:54.666 --> 57:56.666
Jackson, get down here now.

58:01.333 --> 58:02.958
Beth, meet us at the car.

58:04.083 --> 58:05.041
Beth?

58:05.125 --> 58:07.250
- No, no, stop!
- Beth, can you hear me?

58:07.333 --> 58:08.416
Meet us at the car!

58:12.500 --> 58:13.666
Get up, now.

58:14.375 --> 58:15.375
Elliot.

58:16.416 --> 58:17.416
Come on.

58:19.458 --> 58:21.458
- Come on.
- No.

58:22.583 --> 58:23.583
Beth?

58:26.333 --> 58:27.250
Beth?

58:29.125 --> 58:30.375
Beth, where are you?

58:33.125 --> 58:34.458
Beth, can you hear me?

58:41.958 --> 58:43.500
Ange, what are you doing?

58:50.875 --> 58:52.000
Is that...?

59:02.625 --> 59:03.750
Beth.

59:15.875 --> 59:16.875
Did you see her?

59:22.416 --> 59:23.583
Beth, where are you?

59:26.166 --> 59:27.375
I need to follow her.

59:27.875 --> 59:30.500
Take Elliot and meet us at the car.

59:31.125 --> 59:33.333
I love you. I'm sorry.

59:35.250 --> 59:38.208
But we're supposed to stick together.
Jackson!

59:56.541 --> 59:57.958
I found you.

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:21.958
Beth.

01:01:26.958 --> 01:01:29.916
Beth. Beth, baby.

01:01:33.541 --> 01:01:34.458
You okay?

01:01:37.458 --> 01:01:39.458
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

01:01:39.541 --> 01:01:41.750
We're gonna get you up. It's okay.

01:01:46.250 --> 01:01:47.125
No.

01:02:04.500 --> 01:02:06.500
Elliot? Elliot, wake up.

01:02:08.916 --> 01:02:10.583
Okay, come on. Come on.

01:02:51.583 --> 01:02:52.916
Get the door!

01:02:56.708 --> 01:02:58.083
Who did this to her?

01:03:03.750 --> 01:03:04.791
Who did this to her?

01:03:06.083 --> 01:03:07.875
Jackson, what happened?

01:03:07.958 --> 01:03:09.458
Give me the keys, Ange!

01:03:25.750 --> 01:03:29.583
Jackson.

01:04:33.750 --> 01:04:34.875
Beth. No.

01:04:37.125 --> 01:04:38.208
Beth.

01:04:43.291 --> 01:04:44.250
I'm sorry.

01:04:52.833 --> 01:04:54.041
I'm sorry.

01:04:55.541 --> 01:04:57.166
Fuck!

01:05:11.750 --> 01:05:13.750
No, no, no, please!

01:05:14.166 --> 01:05:16.166
Please, no!

01:05:19.666 --> 01:05:21.666
Please, please!

01:05:22.291 --> 01:05:24.041
No, no!

01:06:12.958 --> 01:06:13.875
Jackson?

01:06:36.291 --> 01:06:38.458
Okay. Okay.

01:06:39.166 --> 01:06:40.833
Elliot, come on. roll over.

01:06:40.916 --> 01:06:43.750
Over, come on. Over.

01:06:44.916 --> 01:06:46.375
Come on.

01:06:48.041 --> 01:06:50.041
El, you need to wake up, okay?

01:06:51.583 --> 01:06:52.583
El, come on.

01:06:52.666 --> 01:06:54.708
Hey, where's Jackson?

01:06:56.250 --> 01:06:58.208
Elliot, where is my brother?

01:07:04.333 --> 01:07:05.458
He took him.

01:07:06.541 --> 01:07:07.625
Who took him?

01:07:08.500 --> 01:07:09.500
Elliott. Who?

01:07:10.833 --> 01:07:11.708
He took him.

01:08:36.957 --> 01:08:40.000
Dear. We have woken you.

01:08:43.082 --> 01:08:46.666
We do apologize
about your pretty little girlfriend.

01:08:48.082 --> 01:08:49.041
You see...

01:08:49.457 --> 01:08:52.291
I could not risk having
the wolves at my door.

01:08:55.125 --> 01:08:56.332
Not again.

01:09:01.125 --> 01:09:02.666
Angela.

01:09:28.750 --> 01:09:30.666
My mother taught me well.

01:09:32.875 --> 01:09:34.582
She'd use the belt on me.

01:09:36.832 --> 01:09:38.832
Garden sheers.

01:09:41.082 --> 01:09:42.875
She'd burn my privates.

01:09:45.750 --> 01:09:47.750
If those girls had just listened.

01:09:58.625 --> 01:09:59.583
Claire?

01:10:30.041 --> 01:10:31.833
Hold still.

01:10:33.500 --> 01:10:35.375
This part is very tricky.

01:10:45.666 --> 01:10:46.500
Hold still.

01:10:47.750 --> 01:10:49.333
Shh!

01:10:51.958 --> 01:10:53.541
It's quiet time now.

01:11:08.250 --> 01:11:09.250
God.

01:11:31.416 --> 01:11:33.416
You remind me of my girls.

01:11:40.875 --> 01:11:42.791
They wouldn't stop talking.

01:11:44.166 --> 01:11:45.958
Whispering around the house.

01:11:47.875 --> 01:11:49.000
I told them.

01:11:49.791 --> 01:11:52.083
Every family has secrets.

01:11:55.083 --> 01:11:56.583
But after little Claire...

01:11:58.541 --> 01:12:00.250
they had to be silenced.

01:12:03.625 --> 01:12:04.625
Hush, now.

01:12:06.541 --> 01:12:09.291
There. All over.

01:12:13.250 --> 01:12:14.750
Now go and get the others.

01:13:33.500 --> 01:13:34.500
Herman.

01:13:35.583 --> 01:13:37.458
Stop staring at her.

01:14:29.083 --> 01:14:30.250
I'm so sorry.

01:14:33.083 --> 01:14:35.208
I'm so sorry I couldn't help you.

01:14:54.208 --> 01:14:57.708
Look what you and
your brother have made me do, Angela.

01:14:59.375 --> 01:15:02.208
- It was all an act, wasn't it?
- Mrs. Green.

01:15:03.125 --> 01:15:04.333
Please let us go.

01:15:05.875 --> 01:15:08.416
You know I can't do that.

01:15:11.750 --> 01:15:14.083
Herman, take him to the shed.

01:15:16.541 --> 01:15:19.500
After you've dealt with him,
bring back the other boy.

01:15:20.375 --> 01:15:21.458
No, no.

01:15:22.166 --> 01:15:25.416
No. Don't you fucking touch him! No.

01:15:25.958 --> 01:15:27.958
Jackson, no, no! No!

01:15:28.833 --> 01:15:30.833
He's the only thing I have left.

01:15:31.041 --> 01:15:32.666
Fucking bitch!

01:15:43.916 --> 01:15:45.000
Shh.

01:15:45.083 --> 01:15:46.125
Hush now.

01:16:34.625 --> 01:16:36.625
Shh, shh, shh!

01:16:37.375 --> 01:16:38.500
Hold still.

01:17:12.208 --> 01:17:13.333
Leave her alone.

01:17:14.500 --> 01:17:16.416
Herman, grab him.

01:17:23.958 --> 01:17:26.125
That's it, hold him!

01:17:31.916 --> 01:17:33.666
Herman?

01:17:36.708 --> 01:17:37.791
Herman!

01:17:55.291 --> 01:17:57.833
Hey, hey, hey. Come on. Hey.

01:17:58.333 --> 01:18:01.041
It's all right, Mommy's here.

01:18:01.125 --> 01:18:03.416
I'm here for you.
I'm here. I'm here, okay?

01:18:03.500 --> 01:18:05.458
I'll not let anything happen to you.
I promise.

01:18:05.541 --> 01:18:06.583
Herman.

01:18:17.250 --> 01:18:18.250
No!

01:18:21.750 --> 01:18:22.916
No!

01:18:24.708 --> 01:18:27.125
He was all I had left!

01:18:29.583 --> 01:18:31.583
No! Stop!

01:18:33.208 --> 01:18:35.500
You hurt my boy.

01:18:38.083 --> 01:18:39.791
Stop!

01:18:41.375 --> 01:18:42.666
Leave him alone.

01:18:44.583 --> 01:18:46.333
He was my boy.

01:18:46.916 --> 01:18:48.666
Please help.

01:18:51.083 --> 01:18:52.541
Help us, please.

01:18:52.625 --> 01:18:54.625
Please, please, help us!

01:18:54.958 --> 01:18:56.625
Help him please!

01:18:58.791 --> 01:19:00.583
Please, help us!

01:19:04.416 --> 01:19:07.250
Now it's your turn to be quiet.

01:19:10.416 --> 01:19:11.458
Please!

01:19:12.791 --> 01:19:13.875
Please!

01:19:48.208 --> 01:19:50.041
No!

01:20:35.625 --> 01:20:37.125
I'm gonna go get help. Okay?

01:20:37.541 --> 01:20:40.291
- Yeah.
- Okay.

01:21:38.583 --> 01:21:39.458
Jackson?

01:21:42.333 --> 01:21:43.291
Jackson?

01:21:46.500 --> 01:21:47.416
Hey.

01:21:50.458 --> 01:21:51.541
Have you seen Beth?

01:21:56.041 --> 01:21:57.083
I can't find her.

01:23:19.958 --> 01:23:20.958
Angela...

01:23:23.166 --> 01:23:24.416
It's okay to see him now.

01:23:43.750 --> 01:23:44.583
Hey.

01:23:45.583 --> 01:23:46.458
Hey.

01:23:56.125 --> 01:23:57.666
It's a curse.

01:23:59.958 --> 01:24:01.500
I should have seen it.

01:24:03.583 --> 01:24:04.791
It's my fault.

01:24:05.625 --> 01:24:07.500
There's nothing you could have done.

01:24:09.041 --> 01:24:10.166
Jackson, he...

01:24:10.583 --> 01:24:11.833
I'm coming over.

01:24:20.125 --> 01:24:22.125
You can't be alone now, Angela.

01:24:31.791 --> 01:24:33.041
I'm not alone.
