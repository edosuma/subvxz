We have a baby now.

22:03.480 --> 22:04.617
It's one of the perks.

22:21.440 --> 22:22.941
I haven't seen her today.

22:23.560 --> 22:25.425
She was gone
when I woke up this morning.

22:26.240 --> 22:28.060
Maybe she went to the mall.

22:28.200 --> 22:30.464
I heard there was a sale
at Old Navy.

22:32.720 --> 22:33.709

22:44.280 --> 22:45.599
Our baby's so beautiful.

22:54.440 --> 22:55.657
I wish I could hold her.

22:59.440 --> 23:00.429
Me too.

23:06.040 --> 23:09.464
We should just
run away somewhere.

23:12.320 --> 23:15.221
Start over.
Like a real family.

23:21.280 --> 23:22.417
Where would we go?

23:25.240 --> 23:27.549
Out West. The coast.

23:30.360 --> 23:31.702
Still Gilead.

23:32.960 --> 23:34.097
Hawaii, then.

23:36.040 --> 23:37.029
Maui.

23:42.440 --> 23:44.226
She's gonna love the beach.

23:45.080 --> 23:48.186
(CHUCKLES) Yeah.
She can play in the sun.

23:49.680 --> 23:51.625
She's gonna try
to eat the sand.

23:52.280 --> 23:53.599
Sheis?
Yeah.

23:54.640 --> 23:55.959
All kids do it.

23:56.600 --> 23:58.500
She won't. She's too smart.
Like her mom.

24:05.760 --> 24:06.897
Holly.

24:10.680 --> 24:12.227
That's what I want
to name her.

24:13.520 --> 24:14.839
After my mom.

24:16.680 --> 24:17.999
I mean, if that's okay.

24:20.640 --> 24:21.743
Holly.

24:25.200 --> 24:26.462

not at his post. Sir?

24:37.920 --> 24:38.909
I'll take care of it.

24:39.000 --> 24:40.627
He never showed up
for his shift this morning.

24:49.320 --> 24:50.457
COMMANDER FRED: What is it?

24:51.120 --> 24:52.508
Sir, I think, uh...

24:54.720 --> 24:56.221
I think we may
have a situation.

24:57.160 --> 24:58.149
Do you know what
this looks like for me?

24:58.240 --> 24:59.343
Fred. Please.

24:59.800 --> 25:02.587
I gave her the opportunity
to elevate herself.

25:02.680 --> 25:05.945
To be a wife, a mother. To be
associated with the Waterford name.

25:06.040 --> 25:08.099
Fred, we can't be sure
that she ran off with him.

25:08.200 --> 25:10.020

risk so much to leave?

couldn't hear much of anything.

You were that frightened.

30:22.440 --> 30:23.429
Yeah.

30:24.040 --> 30:27.146
Yet you preferred
to hide in the attic

30:27.920 --> 30:29.182
to avoid coming home.

to my daughter.

spend some more time with my baby,

30:49.800 --> 30:51.301

Are you all right?

50:11.920 --> 50:13.581
Thus says the Lord:

50:14.680 --> 50:18.946
even the captives of the
mighty shall be taken away,

50:21.200 --> 50:25.500
and the prey of the terrible
be delivered.

50:27.480 --> 50:32.417
For I will contend with
he who contends with you,

50:35.600 --> 50:37.909
and I will
save your children.

50:44.920 --> 50:46.785

Shh. Oh, no.

50:54.000 --> 50:56.104
Shh, Shh, shh.

50:56.280 --> 50:57.599
I'll get you a bottle.

50:58.400 --> 50:59.719
NO, wait.

50:59.880 --> 51:02.144
(BABY NICHOLE CRYING)
Wait.

51:09.840 --> 51:11.341
(CRYING)

51:13.480 --> 51:15.789
Shh,shh,shh,shh,shh.

51:42.440 --> 51:44.817
(COOING)

52:36.760 --> 52:38.341
