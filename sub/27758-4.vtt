WEBVTT

00:02.210 --> 00:04.418
-Hey.
-Whoa! Petey.

00:04.502 --> 00:05.877
-What's going on?
-What's up, buddy?

00:05.960 --> 00:08.210
-Bac from the-- back from
the college tour, right?
-Yeah!

00:08.293 --> 00:10.210
Hey. I'm, uh-- I'm back.

00:10.585 --> 00:11.752
I don't care.

00:12.418 --> 00:13.377
ALI: My boyfriend and I,

00:13.627 --> 00:16.085
we just took our relationship
to the next level.

00:16.168 --> 00:17.001
We broke up.

00:17.335 --> 00:18.627
JASON: Women, you don't have
to shave entirely.

00:18.710 --> 00:21.126
Otherwise, it just feels
like another part of the thigh.

00:21.210 --> 00:22.835
If I'm going
into a rough neighborhood,

00:22.919 --> 00:24.460
-I wanna know it.
-Oh, boy.

00:24.543 --> 00:25.794
-Hey, hey.
-Yeah?

00:25.877 --> 00:28.085
I think women are f-- funny.

00:28.168 --> 00:29.335
Spread the word.

00:29.418 --> 00:30.377
What am I doing wrong?

00:30.710 --> 00:33.168
No one in here knows that you
are the next Kevin Hart.

00:33.251 --> 00:34.543
I'm not the next Kevin Hart.

00:34.627 --> 00:36.585
Kevin Hart is Kevin Hart.
We have a Kevin Hart.

00:36.669 --> 00:38.502
He's... perfect for the part.

00:39.001 --> 00:41.126
I'm just a... I'm a club guy.

00:55.251 --> 00:56.752
Shouldn't we hustle?

00:56.835 --> 00:58.418
Show's at eight.
There might be traffic.

00:58.502 --> 01:01.126
Easy, Pete.
There's no show without us.

01:01.210 --> 01:02.877
That starts
on the way down, baby.

01:02.960 --> 01:04.543
It's an attitude.
You gotta...

01:04.627 --> 01:06.710
You gotta own
this thing, you know?

01:06.794 --> 01:08.210
Pete...

01:08.293 --> 01:09.960
the middle act drives.

01:10.043 --> 01:12.377
Didn't I tell you that?
The middle act drives, baby.

01:12.460 --> 01:14.585
-Come on.
-Okay.

01:14.669 --> 01:17.377
When I was starting out,
I drove Jay Mohr.

01:17.460 --> 01:20.752
Had to listen
to "Who Let the Dogs Out?"
17 times.

01:20.835 --> 01:22.418
The guy was obsessed.

01:22.502 --> 01:24.710
Never let them
see you sweat, Petey.

01:24.794 --> 01:26.543
You're gonna be doing
this for years.

01:26.627 --> 01:28.585
You gotta learn
to relax a little bit.

01:28.669 --> 01:30.293
Yeah, yeah. No, I...

01:30.377 --> 01:32.293
I wasn't really sure
what to do next,

01:32.377 --> 01:34.669
but I'm kind of saying
yes to everything.

01:34.752 --> 01:36.418
That's good, man.
That's what you gotta do.

01:36.502 --> 01:38.669
You gotta get up
when you can get up.
You gotta grind it.

01:38.752 --> 01:41.001
That's my thinking.
I'm even, you know,

01:41.085 --> 01:44.669
sort of considering doing
this, um, Christian tour.

01:45.502 --> 01:47.502
I mean, it's not...
it's not a certain thing.

01:47.585 --> 01:49.418
They just-- I did
a show at a temple.

01:49.502 --> 01:51.669
A woman said, "I think you'd be
good for the religious market,"

01:51.752 --> 01:54.502
-so I have an offer, but...
-Fuck that!

01:55.960 --> 01:57.669
Pete, I meant--

01:57.752 --> 01:59.835
When I said everything,
I didn't mean everything.

01:59.919 --> 02:01.085
I mean real comedy.

02:01.168 --> 02:04.210
Real. Not some fucking
whacked-out Jesus shit.

02:04.293 --> 02:05.960
Right.

02:06.043 --> 02:08.460
Yeah, no. I'm not sure
I'm gonna do it, either.

02:08.543 --> 02:09.877
Good.

02:10.794 --> 02:12.293
You gonna buckle up?

02:12.377 --> 02:14.752
(sighs)

02:14.835 --> 02:17.752
You know,
the statistics are in.

02:18.752 --> 02:19.794
Come on.

02:19.877 --> 02:23.710
(heavy metal blaring on stereo)

02:24.835 --> 02:26.543
Let's roll, Petey!

02:34.502 --> 02:39.126
♪ Can the pestilence
within you be bled out?  ♪

02:39.210 --> 02:44.418
♪ May I have the honor
of this amputation? ♪

02:44.502 --> 02:46.710

02:46.794 --> 02:49.669

02:53.919 --> 02:56.835
-(music stops)
-Jason: Oh! Hi-yah!

02:56.919 --> 02:59.043
Whoa. Whoa.

03:00.210 --> 03:02.001
This is it?

03:02.085 --> 03:03.168
This is it.

03:03.251 --> 03:04.960
What do you mean,
"This is it?"

03:05.043 --> 03:07.168
You never stayed
at the Comedy Club
condo before?

03:07.251 --> 03:08.543
No.

03:08.627 --> 03:11.585
Is this your first club weekend,
your first full weekend?

03:11.669 --> 03:14.251
Yeah, I've only done
one-nighters, colleges.

03:14.335 --> 03:16.168
You are gonna
love this here, man.

03:16.251 --> 03:18.960
This is not like the city,
where they have a bunch
of entertainment options

03:19.043 --> 03:20.835
and nobody really cares
that you're there.

03:20.919 --> 03:24.126
Here, they're grateful
you just showed up.

03:25.085 --> 03:27.335
Get ready, baby.
This is it.

03:27.418 --> 03:29.043
Do you like
waitresses, Pete?

03:29.126 --> 03:32.960
Uh, yeah, I like when
they call me "Hon." That's fun.

03:33.043 --> 03:34.710
What the hell are you
talking about, Pete?

03:34.794 --> 03:37.460
Why would you ever get
into comedy if you don't
want to bang waitresses?

03:40.043 --> 03:42.669
Wow. It's like
an assassin's hideout.

03:42.752 --> 03:46.210
This is a hot scene, baby.
I've got good memories here,
believe me.

03:46.293 --> 03:48.919
-Look who it is.
-Ali: Ah!

03:49.001 --> 03:52.627
-Al. Hey.
-Hey.

03:53.543 --> 03:56.043
What are you--
Are you working
this weekend?

03:56.126 --> 03:57.418
Yeah.

03:57.502 --> 03:59.669
I mean, yeah,
I just saw the lineup.

03:59.752 --> 04:03.794
-We could have,
you know, come up together.
-Yeah, I wish I had known.

04:03.877 --> 04:06.543
Hey, guys, let's get some
ground rules down, huh?
Road shit.

04:06.627 --> 04:09.460
I sleep all day,
so keep it down
before four p.m.,

04:09.543 --> 04:11.168
unless, of course,
I'm still sleeping.

04:11.251 --> 04:14.627
Also, if you eat
some of my food,
I will eat all of your food.

04:14.710 --> 04:17.960
That is the Chicago way.
Connery, Untouchables  .

04:18.043 --> 04:19.710
I'm gonna go take a nap.

04:19.794 --> 04:23.460
If you hear any noises,
I'm doing push-ups.

04:23.543 --> 04:25.752
(as Andrew Dice Clay): Oh!

04:25.835 --> 04:27.919
(both laugh)

04:28.001 --> 04:29.502
Wow.

04:30.543 --> 04:34.126
-That, uh, that must
have been a fun commute.
-Yeah.

04:34.210 --> 04:36.251
Did he bring a book
of CDs with him?

04:36.710 --> 04:40.168
No, but he did think
Spotify is a laundry app.

04:40.502 --> 04:42.335
Who--

04:42.418 --> 04:44.960
-I don't know.
-So many feelings,
so many thoughts.

04:45.043 --> 04:47.335
-Yeah.
-(sighs)

04:50.001 --> 04:54.293
I'm surprised to, you know,
see you in deep Jersey.

04:54.377 --> 04:56.460
Yeah, I, um...

04:56.543 --> 05:00.835
-I'm still running that,
that late-night set.
-Oh, right.

05:00.919 --> 05:04.585
Yeah, I was working on it
in the city, but I just

05:04.669 --> 05:07.543
kind of felt like I needed
to get a new read on it.

05:07.627 --> 05:09.210
-Oh, absolutely.
-Yeah.

05:09.293 --> 05:12.126
-You gotta make sure it works
for, you know, real people.
-Yeah.

05:12.210 --> 05:14.627
-Uh, how are you?
-I'm good.

05:14.710 --> 05:16.502
Good, good, good.

05:16.585 --> 05:19.502
I started, um...
I'm actually dating
somebody now,

05:19.585 --> 05:21.627
so that's...
that's nice.

05:21.710 --> 05:23.627
-Cool.
-Very nice.

05:23.710 --> 05:26.877
Yeah. Kat,
her name's Kat. Kitty.

05:27.877 --> 05:30.543
-How's it going?
-It's great.

05:30.627 --> 05:32.460
-Yeah?
-Yeah, it's going
really great.

05:32.543 --> 05:35.794
It's actually going so well,
the only thing I worry about
is how well it's going.

05:35.877 --> 05:37.418
(chuckles)

05:37.502 --> 05:41.168
-Glad you could still find
a way to worry about it.
-Oh yeah.

05:41.251 --> 05:43.502
-(Ali laughs)
-That's my specialty.

05:43.585 --> 05:46.377
-I'm like
Anxiety MacGyver.
-Mm.

05:46.460 --> 05:49.168
I can make a bomb
out of even a good thing.

05:49.251 --> 05:51.168
Mm-hmm.

05:51.251 --> 05:53.835
Oh! Fun fact.

05:53.919 --> 05:55.669
There's a lot of cheese
in the fridge.

05:55.752 --> 05:59.794
Like, whoever was here before
just left all the cheese.

05:59.877 --> 06:01.335
Great, I'm starving.

06:01.418 --> 06:03.460
(laughs)
Are you seriously
gonna eat the cheese?

06:03.543 --> 06:06.085
-No!
-(laughing):
I really thought you were!

06:06.168 --> 06:09.669
I do not want to eat
Pablo Francisco's cheese.

06:09.752 --> 06:12.919
(pop music playing over PA)

06:24.126 --> 06:25.460
You know they got
a go-kart track

06:25.543 --> 06:27.794
on the second floor
of this mall, Pete?

06:27.877 --> 06:28.960
Maybe we'll go.

06:29.043 --> 06:31.168
-Can I help you?
-What's up, man?

06:31.960 --> 06:34.710
-Can I help you?
-Yeah, sure. I'm the headliner.

06:34.794 --> 06:37.126
I, uh, I'm the guy.

06:37.960 --> 06:39.335
Okay, what's your name?

06:41.126 --> 06:43.543
Serious? My-- Jason Webber,
I'm on the marquee.

06:43.627 --> 06:46.126
I got a big fucking poster
out front.

06:46.210 --> 06:48.752
I have Jason Webber
at the front entrance.

06:48.835 --> 06:50.418
Have you seen the poster?

06:50.502 --> 06:52.835
Let me do
the poster for him.

06:52.919 --> 06:54.085
Ali:
Mm.

06:55.460 --> 06:57.043
That's the face
he does on his poster.

06:57.126 --> 06:58.752
-I do it right there
on the poster.
-Do it again.

06:58.835 --> 07:00.418
-Watch this.
-Look at this.

07:00.502 --> 07:01.627
That's-- See?

07:01.710 --> 07:04.710
Sorry, man,
I'm not a comedy fan.

07:04.794 --> 07:07.085
-Follow me.
-(Pete sighs)

07:07.168 --> 07:08.585
Okay.

07:08.669 --> 07:11.251
(rock music playing)

07:11.335 --> 07:12.543
Here you go.

07:13.502 --> 07:15.669
Okay, okay.

07:16.460 --> 07:18.251
Nice.

07:18.335 --> 07:19.877
It smells
like leather.

07:19.960 --> 07:21.585
Hey. Hi.
Hello.

07:21.669 --> 07:24.293
-I'm Gavin.
I'm the club manager.
-Ali: Hey.

07:24.377 --> 07:27.335
Now, you met Steve.
Deborah's gonna be
taking care of you.

07:27.418 --> 07:28.877
What happened to Richie?

07:28.960 --> 07:30.960
Remember Richie?
Richie was a great guy.

07:31.043 --> 07:33.126
I'm sorry, I don't know Richie.
I don't have any idea

07:33.210 --> 07:35.377
what occurred here
before the club was acquired.

07:35.460 --> 07:37.627
The guy was a blast,
a lunatic, but a great guy.

07:37.710 --> 07:40.627
He used to keep his gun
on the desk when we settled up.

07:40.710 --> 07:42.126
-Yeah, hold on.
-It was a bit.

07:42.210 --> 07:45.168
Uh-huh. No. Yeah.

07:45.251 --> 07:47.293
Right, it's a boneless wing.

07:47.377 --> 07:49.669
Right. But no,
it's a wing.

07:49.752 --> 07:52.377
Right, so if you're looking
for it alphabetically,
it'll be under W.

07:52.460 --> 07:55.335
Okay, I've got
the running order here.

07:55.418 --> 07:57.835
-Ali, you're hosting.
It's ten.
-Yeah.

07:57.919 --> 08:00.460
We need, you know,
big energy, bright.

08:00.543 --> 08:01.794
Okay. Yeah.

08:01.877 --> 08:03.710
I'm just running
a late-night set,
so that's fine.

08:03.794 --> 08:06.460
And here are the announcements.
Please read all of them.

08:06.543 --> 08:08.210
A lot of info on there:
social media,

08:08.293 --> 08:11.126
drink specials, upcoming events.
Even a couple jokes on there.

08:11.210 --> 08:13.960
Oh, you wrote...
You guys wrote jokes
for me to say?

08:14.043 --> 08:15.669
Yeah, just to make it
easy on you.

08:15.752 --> 08:17.794
Oh, that's really helpful.
Thank you.

08:17.877 --> 08:19.585
Please read those verbatim.
They do work.

08:19.669 --> 08:20.960
Cool.

08:21.043 --> 08:22.543
-All right, Pete.
-Yes.

08:22.627 --> 08:24.960
-You're our middle.
You'll do 25.
-Right on.

08:25.043 --> 08:27.794
And you do 45.
Please keep to time.

08:27.877 --> 08:30.794
There's a red countdown
clock right at your feet.
You can't miss it.

08:30.877 --> 08:34.085
Not a problem.
45, tight as a drum,
wall-to-wall laughs.

08:34.168 --> 08:37.377
I'm not prepping
some late-night set
that nobody's gonna see.

08:40.585 --> 08:42.001
-Okay.
-Ali: Okay.

08:42.085 --> 08:43.335
(door closes)

08:43.418 --> 08:45.418
Kid runs a tight ship.

08:45.502 --> 08:48.502
-Dude, what
the fuck was that?
-What?

08:48.585 --> 08:52.752
Are you that insecure
you have to tear me down
in front of the manager?

08:53.460 --> 08:54.794
Tear you...

08:54.877 --> 08:57.835
Oh, sorry, Ms. Seth Myers.

08:57.919 --> 09:00.335
You know, listen,
I wasn't talking about

09:00.418 --> 09:03.001
your set specifically.
I'm talking about all of it.

09:03.085 --> 09:05.460
-Mm.
-It's all bullshit.

09:05.543 --> 09:08.293
If you were doing
late-night, you wouldn't
think it was bullshit.

09:08.377 --> 09:11.293
Let me tell you something.
Late-night died with Letterman.

09:11.377 --> 09:13.460
Late-night sets are
now just YouTube videos

09:13.543 --> 09:16.210
with the Hyundai commercials
you can't fucking skip.

09:16.293 --> 09:19.043
That's what it is.
Nobody watches
this shit anymore.

09:19.126 --> 09:20.919
-Mm-hmm.
-There's a billion
fucking channels.

09:21.001 --> 09:24.835
-Nobody sees it.
-Okay, all right.
Whatever.

09:24.919 --> 09:26.293
(scoffs)

09:27.794 --> 09:29.377
(scoffs)

09:29.460 --> 09:31.627
(whispers):
"Whatever."

09:42.043 --> 09:43.418
(cheering, whistling)

09:43.502 --> 09:46.835
Your host tonight is a very
funny and talented comedienne.

09:46.919 --> 09:49.377
Please give it up for
the lovely and talented

09:49.460 --> 09:51.919
Ali Reissen!

09:52.001 --> 09:54.126
(cheering)

09:59.001 --> 10:00.752
Hello. How are you guys?

10:00.835 --> 10:03.752
-(cheers)
-Yeah? Okay.

10:03.835 --> 10:06.919
-Clap it up for yourselves...
-(applause)

10:07.001 --> 10:09.085
...and these wonderful
high ceilings.

10:09.168 --> 10:11.877
It's so great to be here.
Oh, my God!

10:11.960 --> 10:15.418
I have to say, of all the clubs
I've done in New Jersey

10:15.502 --> 10:17.418
between a Chipotle and a Target,

10:17.502 --> 10:20.752
this is the one
I'm doing right now.

10:20.835 --> 10:23.043
(laughter)

10:23.126 --> 10:26.126
I was told I have to do
some of these announcements,

10:26.210 --> 10:27.960
so, um, here we go.

10:28.043 --> 10:31.085
You can find the Chuckle Shack
on social media.

10:31.168 --> 10:33.960
-You guys have
social media? Yeah!
-Yeah!

10:34.043 --> 10:35.835
They are @TheChuckleShackComedy

10:35.919 --> 10:38.794
on Twitter, on Facebook,
on Instagram, on Snapchat.

10:38.877 --> 10:40.794
Okay, it's shocking
they have a Snapchat.

10:40.877 --> 10:43.460
Um, every Sunday
this month at one p.m.

10:43.543 --> 10:46.418
there's something called
Two-Milk Minimum.

10:46.502 --> 10:48.210
It's family friendly comedy.

10:48.293 --> 10:50.960
The show is so funny,
you'll laugh till you squirt...

10:51.043 --> 10:54.835
-(scattered laughter)
-...milk out of your nose.

10:54.919 --> 10:58.377
It's actually real.
That's actually written
here for me to say.

10:59.335 --> 11:03.627
All right, guys. Well,
it's so cool to be here.

11:03.710 --> 11:05.377
I actually have
some exciting news.

11:05.460 --> 11:08.377
I am doing stand-up
on television next week

11:08.460 --> 11:10.168
-on Seth Myers. Yeah.
-(cheering)

11:10.251 --> 11:12.710
Would it be okay
if I ran my set for you guys?

11:12.794 --> 11:16.502
-(cheers and applause)
-Okay, awesome.
I'm just gonna get into it.

11:16.585 --> 11:19.085
Okay, here we go.
I'm gonna do the whole...

11:19.960 --> 11:22.293
Hey, guys.
Great to be here.

11:22.377 --> 11:24.251
(cheers, applause)

11:26.669 --> 11:28.627
Oh, my God.
My name is Ali,

11:28.710 --> 11:31.377
which is short for Allison.

11:31.460 --> 11:34.502
Allison sounds way more
sophisticated, right?

11:34.585 --> 11:37.835
Like, Allison could win
a Pulitzer Prize.

11:37.919 --> 11:39.960
Ali could win
a free Blooming Onion

11:40.043 --> 11:41.794
for taking a tit out
at Applebee's.

11:41.877 --> 11:45.001
You know what I mean?
It's a different...

11:45.085 --> 11:46.502
It's a different vibe.

11:46.585 --> 11:48.210
-(Ali continues over TV)
-(Pete laughing)

11:48.293 --> 11:49.794
Oh, stop.

11:49.877 --> 11:51.502
She's doing good.

11:51.585 --> 11:55.168
-If you're into
that, I guess.
-I am.

11:56.543 --> 11:58.126
Hey, guys. I'm Deborah.

11:58.210 --> 11:59.669
I'm gonna be
your server tonight.

11:59.752 --> 12:01.210
Can I get you
anything right now?

12:01.293 --> 12:06.543
Oh, yeah. Can I please have
the Cedric the Enchilada?

12:06.627 --> 12:08.710
Amazing.
And for you?

12:08.794 --> 12:11.085
I'll have a couple
of Heinekens and a shot,
whiskey.

12:11.168 --> 12:12.710
-Okay.
-Pete, whiskey?

12:12.794 --> 12:16.043
-No, I-- No.
-No?

12:16.126 --> 12:18.543
I... I got to go up.

12:18.627 --> 12:21.460
(scoffs)
I'm traveling
with Paddington Bear,

12:21.543 --> 12:22.710
I apologize.
Uh...

12:22.794 --> 12:24.251
Okay, so couple
of Heinekens and a shot.

12:24.335 --> 12:25.794
Can I get you a shot?
Shot of whiskey?

12:25.877 --> 12:29.126
Oh, no, I can't drink
while I'm working the tablet.

12:29.210 --> 12:30.835
It starts to get all blurry.

12:31.335 --> 12:34.126
-Blurry tablet,
okay. Um...
-Yeah.

12:34.210 --> 12:36.001
-All right, I'll, uh--
-So a shot for you?

12:36.085 --> 12:37.210
Yeah, just a shot for me.

12:37.293 --> 12:38.418
-Okay, thanks.
-Yeah.

12:38.502 --> 12:40.752
Oh, if you could
chill it, please.

12:40.835 --> 12:43.168
-Perfect. Bye, guys.
-Thanks, Deborah.

12:44.669 --> 12:46.960
Ah...

12:47.043 --> 12:48.960
How 'bout that?

12:49.043 --> 12:51.168
Pays to be the headliner,
huh, Pete?

12:53.960 --> 12:54.919
(laughter)

12:55.001 --> 12:57.210
I don't like it.
I don't like the museum.

12:57.293 --> 12:59.543
It's boring.
I don't want to go.

12:59.627 --> 13:02.919
When I'm at the museum,
I'm not looking at paintings
to appreciate them.

13:03.001 --> 13:09.085
I'm staring at the painting,
trying to figure out how long
is appropriate to look at it,

13:09.168 --> 13:11.794
so when I walk away, the other
people in the room aren't like,

13:11.877 --> 13:14.960
-"Well, he didn't
get it at all."
-(laughter)

13:15.043 --> 13:17.335
So I make a real serious face.
I'm like, "Mm-mm.

13:17.418 --> 13:20.418
Look at the brush strokes.
Oh, yeah."

13:20.502 --> 13:23.835
But in my head I'm just like,
♪ Honey Nut Cheerios! ♪

13:23.919 --> 13:25.335
(laughter)

13:25.418 --> 13:28.543
♪ Have 'em for breakfast
or lunch, you decide! ♪

13:28.627 --> 13:30.043
It's not even a real song.

13:30.126 --> 13:33.293
Give it up for Jason Webber!

13:33.377 --> 13:35.251
(cheering, applauding)

13:35.335 --> 13:38.001
(rock music playing)

13:44.919 --> 13:47.960
All right!
What's up, fucker?

13:48.043 --> 13:50.502
-(cheering)
-I don't know. Listen.

13:50.585 --> 13:54.794
Sometimes stereotypes are just
kind of a reality, you know?

13:54.877 --> 13:59.335
So, that's not racism, you know?
It's pattern recognition.

13:59.418 --> 14:03.335
I mean, if you want to go see
a film in a quiet theater,

14:03.418 --> 14:07.794
steer clear of Harlem,
you know what I mean?

14:07.877 --> 14:10.001
We're all a little bit
racist, right?

14:10.085 --> 14:14.835
I mean, who hasn't walked
onto an airplane,
seen a Chinese pilot

14:14.919 --> 14:18.335
and thought,
"I'm gonna buckle up
a little bit tighter."

14:18.418 --> 14:21.335
-(scattered laughter)
-What do you want from me?

14:21.418 --> 14:24.877
I mean, I don't know how to be
a man sometimes, right?

14:24.960 --> 14:28.251
I mean, I'm not sure
how to approach a woman,

14:28.335 --> 14:30.335
how to approach a girl,
you know?

14:30.418 --> 14:33.835
We live in a time where, uh,
you know, we're all on thin ice.

14:33.919 --> 14:35.752
I mean, I don't know--
I don't know how--

14:35.835 --> 14:37.502
What am I supposed
to say, right?

14:37.585 --> 14:40.418
I mean,
what's more creepy

14:40.502 --> 14:43.669
than asking a girl whether
or not you can kiss her?

14:43.752 --> 14:46.293
"Hey, do you mind
if I, um...

14:46.377 --> 14:48.585
-"I mean, I just wanna...
-(laughter)

14:48.669 --> 14:50.543
"I'd like to take this...

14:50.627 --> 14:53.585
"this one and this one
and... uhh, uhh.

14:53.669 --> 14:54.960
Could I... uhh!"

14:55.043 --> 14:57.669
You know, "Do you mind
if I use tongue? Could you..."

14:57.752 --> 15:00.168
You know, I don't know
how to talk to a girl.

15:00.251 --> 15:03.418
And how are we supposed
to get into actual sex?

15:03.502 --> 15:05.335
I mean, do you write out
a form and say,

15:05.418 --> 15:08.043
"Hey, do you mind
if we, uh, do a little fucking?

15:08.126 --> 15:11.043
"Would you-- Is it okay
if I put it in missionary?

15:11.126 --> 15:12.919
How about dog-style?"

15:13.001 --> 15:17.126
Do I say, "Hey do you mind
if I, uh, slip this in?"

15:17.210 --> 15:19.168
"Oh, okay."
"All right."

15:19.251 --> 15:22.585
"Do you mind if I, um--
Is it okay if I pull it out?"

15:22.669 --> 15:23.919
"Okay."

15:24.001 --> 15:25.669
"And do you mind
if I speed it up?

15:25.752 --> 15:27.418
"Do you mind if I--
Yeah! Oh, oh!

15:27.502 --> 15:29.251
"Was that okay?
Sorry, I didn't know.

15:29.335 --> 15:30.543
"Is it okay?
Is it not okay?

15:30.627 --> 15:32.335
Is it okay?
Is it not okay?"

15:33.835 --> 15:36.877
(cell phone beeping)

15:40.168 --> 15:42.377
-Hey!
-Kat: Hi!

15:42.460 --> 15:44.794
-Hi!
- There you are.

15:44.877 --> 15:46.794
-Oh, my God.
- Hi.

15:46.877 --> 15:49.919
-I miss you so much.
- I miss you, too.

15:50.001 --> 15:52.585
- How was the show?
-It was good.

15:52.669 --> 15:54.335
I'm in a Comedy Condo.

15:55.043 --> 15:57.293
I feel like I'm on a stakeout

15:57.377 --> 15:58.960
or in witness protection.

15:59.043 --> 16:01.168
Hey, Pete, you're
cutting out a little.

16:01.251 --> 16:02.752
Sorry, can you hear me?

16:02.835 --> 16:06.794
- Um, yes. Okay, yeah.
-There's like
no cell service here.

16:06.877 --> 16:10.377
-I think it's
a Verizon community.
-(Kat laughs)

16:10.460 --> 16:12.502
Um, but, yeah, I'm good.
How are you?

16:12.585 --> 16:15.293
Oh, I'm good.
It was a long day at work.

16:15.377 --> 16:17.460
It was...
Yeah, it was just busy.

16:17.543 --> 16:20.126
Now what? You got
your pajama-jams on?

16:20.210 --> 16:23.001
Yeah, now I'm just in bed
just thinking about you.

16:23.085 --> 16:25.835
Oh. I wish I was there.

16:25.919 --> 16:28.001
Yeah?

16:28.085 --> 16:29.877
Why do you wish you were here?

16:32.460 --> 16:34.543
Yeah? Uh...

16:34.627 --> 16:37.251
Um, well, uh...

16:49.168 --> 16:51.919
This is fucking ridiculous.

16:53.251 --> 16:54.877
Hello.

16:55.543 --> 17:00.794
We just tore the club down
and you're drinking tea?

17:01.460 --> 17:05.085
I'm drinking tea,
and I'm pretty psyched about it.

17:07.126 --> 17:09.126
Where's Pete?

17:09.669 --> 17:11.460
I think he's in his room.

17:11.543 --> 17:15.293
What, am I on the road
with the fucking Osmonds?

17:17.418 --> 17:18.835
Enjoy your chamomile.

17:18.919 --> 17:20.627
Enjoy your push-ups!

17:20.710 --> 17:22.752
(door closes)

17:22.835 --> 17:25.168
(mutters):
Fucking weirdo.

17:25.251 --> 17:27.960
-I'm so deep right now.
I'm so deep.
-Kat: Oh, yeah.

17:28.043 --> 17:29.418
-Yeah.
-Oh, fuck.

17:29.502 --> 17:31.877
- How-- Are you close?
-I'm fucking close.

17:31.960 --> 17:33.377
-Yeah?
-Are you-- Are you close?

17:33.460 --> 17:35.293
Yeah, I'm close.

17:35.377 --> 17:36.627
I want you to--

17:36.710 --> 17:38.877
Hold on.
Kitty, you're cutting out.

17:38.960 --> 17:40.543
-Can you hear me?
- Yeah, I can hear you.

17:40.627 --> 17:43.210
- Can you hear me?
-I'm close. Are you close?

17:43.293 --> 17:44.960
- Yeah. I want you to come.
-I'm so close.

17:45.043 --> 17:47.126
-I'm gonna come.
Are you close?
-Yeah.

17:47.210 --> 17:49.168
- Yeah, do you
wanna come for me?
-  Are we gonna come?

17:49.251 --> 17:51.710
I'm gonna come.
Come with me.
Come with me!

17:51.794 --> 17:53.377
Oh, God!

17:53.460 --> 17:55.418
(muffled):
Oh, God.

17:55.502 --> 17:57.168
Oh!

17:57.251 --> 17:59.085
(grunts)

17:59.168 --> 18:01.877
(gasps)

18:01.960 --> 18:03.585
(panting)

18:03.669 --> 18:07.168
Kitty, yeah, that was amazing.

18:07.835 --> 18:09.669
Are you close?

18:11.335 --> 18:13.085
I'm-- Are you there?

18:13.168 --> 18:14.585
Can you hear?
Are you close?

18:14.669 --> 18:16.877
Kat, I-- I'm done.

18:16.960 --> 18:18.585
Oh, you-- Fuck, okay.

18:18.669 --> 18:21.001
-I'm sorry, I thought you--
- No, I'm right there.
I'm right there.

18:21.085 --> 18:22.293
- I'm so close.
-You're close?

18:22.377 --> 18:23.710
Yeah, just keep
on talking to me.

18:23.794 --> 18:25.126
- Talk dirty for me.
-Okay.

18:25.210 --> 18:28.460
Yeah, talk about
your hard cock for me, Pete.

18:28.543 --> 18:30.752
It's a... It's a sad scene
down there.

18:30.835 --> 18:33.251
- Okay, just--
-It looks like
a cheese doodle in the rain.

18:33.335 --> 18:36.710
Pete, no bits. Don't do bits
right now. I just--

18:36.794 --> 18:38.126
Okay.

18:38.210 --> 18:39.585
I'm fucking...

18:39.669 --> 18:41.752
I'm making you beg
for my big hard one.

18:41.835 --> 18:44.960
-Uh-huh. Yeah?
-I'm fucking you
so hard and so deep.

18:45.043 --> 18:47.543
- Uh-uh.
-Gonna wedge
my soft one in there.

18:47.627 --> 18:49.293
- Pete!
-(laughing)

18:49.377 --> 18:50.919
I'm just gonna--
Just give me a second.

18:51.001 --> 18:53.126
No, no, no. Don't--
I'm fucking you.

18:53.210 --> 18:55.126
I'm fucking you, I'm sorry.
I'm fucking you...

18:55.210 --> 18:56.794
with my Sorcerer's Stone.

18:56.877 --> 18:58.502
-Pete!
-Here comes
my Goblet of Fire.

18:58.585 --> 19:01.460
Stop! It's not funny.
I'm not...

19:01.543 --> 19:03.085
I lost it. I'm not...

19:03.168 --> 19:05.752
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, it's just,

19:05.835 --> 19:09.794
as soon as I come, you know,
sex, like, it doesn't really
make any sense.

19:09.877 --> 19:11.251
I can't--
I'm really sorry.

19:11.335 --> 19:15.418
No, it's fine.
I'm glad you came.
I'm gonna, um...

19:15.502 --> 19:18.001
This is just like
the sex shop all over again.

19:18.085 --> 19:19.377
I'm s-- Shit.

19:19.460 --> 19:22.293
I'm not in the mood anymore.
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

19:22.377 --> 19:24.085
Kitty...

19:24.168 --> 19:26.210
-Bye.
-(phone beeping)

19:29.460 --> 19:30.752
(loud knocking)

19:30.835 --> 19:32.919
Petey! Come on,
baby, let's roll!

19:33.001 --> 19:35.251
-What the fuck?
-You don't want to get
tea-bagged, do ya?

19:35.335 --> 19:36.960
We're going
to the mall, bitch!

19:37.043 --> 19:38.377
Let's go.
Come on, Petey!

19:38.460 --> 19:41.293
We're gonna make it happen.
You're gonna love it.

20:23.585 --> 20:25.627
(rock music playing)

20:25.710 --> 20:27.251
Okay, good.
You're all here.

20:27.335 --> 20:29.835
Um, I've been trying to get
a hold of your manager.

20:30.794 --> 20:32.210
I manage myself.
What do you think,

20:32.293 --> 20:34.210
I'm gonna pay someone
ten percent to pick up a phone,

20:34.293 --> 20:36.877
maybe answer an e-mail?
No, thanks.

20:36.960 --> 20:38.293
Okay.

20:38.377 --> 20:40.627
Well, I need you
to middle tonight.

20:43.460 --> 20:45.460
What are you talking about?
I thought we had a nice flow.

20:45.543 --> 20:47.043
We're gonna try
something new.

20:47.126 --> 20:49.960
Okay. Hey, Pete,
are you comfortable
headlining tonight?

20:51.669 --> 20:54.126
-Uh, yeah, I can do 45.
-Okay.

20:54.210 --> 20:56.669
What the fuck
are you talking about?

20:57.293 --> 20:59.502
We received complaints
about your set, okay?

20:59.585 --> 21:02.210
-Comment cards?
-No. Yelp.

21:03.335 --> 21:04.960
-Yelp.
-Yes, Yelp.

21:05.043 --> 21:06.919
We dropped
a full half-star
in one night.

21:07.001 --> 21:09.710
We take that
very, very seriously.

21:09.794 --> 21:11.794
Yelp. Really?

21:11.877 --> 21:13.460
You dropped half a star

21:13.543 --> 21:16.502
and you're gonna give these
fucking jerk-offs the power?

21:16.585 --> 21:18.085
If somebody's a pussy,
fuck 'em!

21:18.168 --> 21:20.085
Honestly, you
should just be happy
we're keeping you

21:20.168 --> 21:22.710
on the show at all,
if you can tone it down.

21:24.669 --> 21:26.794
If I can tone it--
Did you see that room?

21:26.877 --> 21:28.168
Who do you think
packed that room?

21:28.251 --> 21:29.835
We papered the house.

21:31.210 --> 21:34.043
That was our mailing list.
We gave them free tickets.

21:36.627 --> 21:38.669
This is...
This is bullshit. This...

21:39.251 --> 21:40.752
This is bullshit.

21:42.460 --> 21:45.126
-Pete: Jay...
-Uh-huh. No, yeah.

21:45.210 --> 21:47.543
Well, it is in the system
under "open food."

21:48.293 --> 21:49.377
Hold on. Yes?

21:50.043 --> 21:52.794
Um, I was just wondering
if maybe I should headline.

21:52.877 --> 21:55.543
'Cause, uh,
I'm not trying to, like,
overstep my boundaries.

21:55.627 --> 21:57.752
It's just that
I have more credits,

21:57.835 --> 22:01.293
and, you know,
I didn't get complaints.

22:01.377 --> 22:02.752
-(laughs) So...
-Yeah.

22:02.835 --> 22:06.293
Actually, the owner did have
some suggestions for you.

22:06.377 --> 22:08.293
Oh, really?

22:08.377 --> 22:10.585
Wa-Was he here?

22:10.669 --> 22:13.752
-He watches on a livestream
from Florida, so...
-Oh.

22:13.835 --> 22:16.335
Mainly, just
the global note is just

22:16.418 --> 22:18.502
have more enthusiasm overall.

22:18.585 --> 22:21.168
Have fun with it,
you know, smile more.
Right?

22:21.251 --> 22:22.627
-Smile more?
-Yeah.

22:22.710 --> 22:25.085
(laughing):
Oh! Just did it.

22:25.168 --> 22:27.168
I just feel like right now,
it feels like you're pretending

22:27.251 --> 22:28.669
to want to read
the announcements,

22:28.752 --> 22:30.835
and I want you
to want to read
the announcements.

22:30.919 --> 22:33.543
-Right. Oh, okay, yeah.
-You know, you're excited
about saying them.

22:33.627 --> 22:36.043
Great. Good luck, everyone.
Have a good show.

22:36.126 --> 22:38.418
-Thanks.
-Thank you.

22:38.960 --> 22:41.001
Smile more.

22:41.085 --> 22:42.418
Cool.

22:44.043 --> 22:45.168
I'm sorry, Al.

22:45.251 --> 22:49.001
And I thought you smiled
just the right amount.

22:49.085 --> 22:50.669
Jason:
It's code, sweetheart.

22:50.752 --> 22:53.335
It means they want a bubbly
chick to open the show.

22:53.418 --> 22:54.502
It's tits and teeth.

22:54.585 --> 22:58.001
Dude, you just got
demoted to middle.

22:58.085 --> 22:59.377
How are you lecturing me?

22:59.460 --> 23:01.794
Tits and teeth,
that's all you are.

23:04.168 --> 23:06.168
-(laughter)
-Um, two drink
specials tonight.

23:06.251 --> 23:10.669
We've got the Chuckle Shackery
and the Jack and Joke.

23:10.752 --> 23:12.335
It's, uh... Yeah.

23:12.418 --> 23:14.377
And, uh, for
an extra ten dollars,

23:14.460 --> 23:16.794
you can get it served
to you in a laugh carafe.

23:16.877 --> 23:19.335
You should definitely do that
if you're utter trash.

23:19.418 --> 23:21.251
(laughter)

23:22.126 --> 23:24.960
All right. Well, now that
I only have three minutes left,

23:25.043 --> 23:26.877
I guess I'll start my set.

23:26.960 --> 23:29.710
I'm eating into the time
as I speak.

23:29.794 --> 23:31.293
Um...

23:32.293 --> 23:35.001
You know, I think I'm gonna
do some new material tonight.

23:35.085 --> 23:38.293
-(cheers, applause)
-How do you guys
feel about that?

23:40.919 --> 23:42.627
I just have to say...

23:42.710 --> 23:44.001
I don't get these idiots

23:44.085 --> 23:46.960
who don't understand
the concept of consent.

23:47.043 --> 23:50.669
They're like, "I have to ask
if she wants a dick in her?

23:50.752 --> 23:54.960
Wait, what? That's gonna
totally throw off my momentum."

23:55.043 --> 23:56.418
(laughter)

23:56.502 --> 23:58.293
You ask questions
all goddamn day.

23:58.377 --> 24:00.251
You go to McDonald's,
you say, "Hi.

24:00.335 --> 24:01.794
"I don't want pickles
on my burger.

24:01.877 --> 24:04.293
Can I make sure that there
are no pickles on my burger?"

24:04.377 --> 24:06.543
It shouldn't be daunting
to say to a woman,

24:06.627 --> 24:08.919
"Hey, can I put my pickle
in your burger?"

24:09.001 --> 24:10.585
(laughter)

24:10.669 --> 24:12.418
She's torpedoing my act.

24:12.502 --> 24:13.919
Ali:
Women love questions.

24:14.001 --> 24:16.794
-Right? They love them.
-(applause)

24:16.877 --> 24:18.710
I get off on questions.

24:18.794 --> 24:21.752
"Can I take you to dinner?"
(moans) You know?

24:21.835 --> 24:25.210
"Do you wanna meet my parents?"
"Yes!" You know?

24:25.293 --> 24:28.377
"Can I fuck you?"
(moans) "Now you can!"

24:31.377 --> 24:33.251
Guys, this has been
such a treat.

24:33.335 --> 24:35.835
I'm gonna bring up your middle
for the evening.

24:35.919 --> 24:39.168
-Are you guys ready
for your middle?
-(cheers, applause)

24:39.251 --> 24:40.627
Oh, my God.
That's so wonderful.

24:40.710 --> 24:44.210
You're gonna love him.
He is a delight and a half.

24:44.293 --> 24:46.168
Give it up for Jason Webber.

24:46.251 --> 24:48.043
(cheers and applause)

24:55.919 --> 24:57.710
What's up, fuckers?

24:58.418 --> 25:00.168
How about a hand
for Ali Reissen?

25:00.251 --> 25:03.001
Or maybe a fist,
that'll loosen her up.

25:03.085 --> 25:05.585
-(scattered laughter)
-(woman groans)

25:05.669 --> 25:07.669
Nyah! Nyah! Nyah!
(chuckles)

25:07.752 --> 25:08.877
Anyway, um...

25:08.960 --> 25:12.251
You know, listen.
Consent, you know.

25:12.335 --> 25:15.168
She's-- "Oh, consent is so easy.
We all get it."

25:15.251 --> 25:18.669
I don't know, you know?
I'm not sure we all do get it.

25:18.752 --> 25:22.919
Right? I mean, it used to be
you got it, you know? I mean...

25:23.001 --> 25:26.001
Is there anything more creepy
than asking a girl to kiss her?

25:26.085 --> 25:29.543
-"Hey, do you mind
if I put these on-on..."
-(murmurs)

25:29.627 --> 25:32.001
You know? And how we gonna
make sex happen?

25:32.085 --> 25:33.460
Now you gotta ask outright,

25:33.543 --> 25:35.126
"Hey, do you mind
if I put it in?

25:35.210 --> 25:39.669
"Hey, Sweet Pea,
are we gonna do it
missionary or dog-style?"

25:39.752 --> 25:41.543
(scattered laughter)

25:41.627 --> 25:43.960
"Hey, do you mind if I insert?"

25:44.043 --> 25:45.835
-(grunts)
-(audience silence)

25:45.919 --> 25:48.877
"Do you mind
if I insert this?"
I mean...

25:48.960 --> 25:52.210
And then her--
And then once you
get it in, it's like,

25:52.293 --> 25:54.043
"Do you mind
if I take it out?"

25:54.126 --> 25:55.543
And what about it
when I put it in?

25:55.627 --> 25:57.210
Do you-- You know,
what do I do here?

25:57.293 --> 25:59.210
-And, huh? I'm...
-(silence)

25:59.293 --> 26:01.085
"I'm about to-to..."
and then, you know, like,

26:01.168 --> 26:04.293
"Where do I arc the load?"
You know? I mean...

26:04.377 --> 26:06.877
"Is it okay on your back?
Should I just--

26:06.960 --> 26:09.877
What if it hits you in the foot,
you know? You gonna sue me?"

26:09.960 --> 26:12.502
-Huh.
-(silence)

26:14.794 --> 26:17.126
-(Jason clears throat)
-(audience murmurs)

26:17.794 --> 26:19.335
Um...

26:20.460 --> 26:22.627
(panting):
A female friend of mine...

26:24.168 --> 26:28.585
Female friend of mine goes
to Mexico to get, uh,

26:28.669 --> 26:31.752
get knock-off birth control
because it's cheaper.

26:31.835 --> 26:33.085
(clears throat)

26:33.168 --> 26:36.960
Do we really think
that's a good idea?

26:37.043 --> 26:38.669
I mean...

26:38.752 --> 26:41.752
there are a lot of Mexicans.

26:41.835 --> 26:44.752
Ali (over TV):
...love him, I promise.
Give it up for Pete Holmes!

26:44.835 --> 26:46.543
(cheers and applause)

26:46.627 --> 26:49.794
(rock music playing)

26:49.877 --> 26:52.251
-Hey.
-Hey.

26:52.335 --> 26:55.377
-Here you go.
-Hey, just the person
I wanted to see!

26:55.460 --> 26:58.168
-Do you need anything else?
-Did you see those dipshits
out there?

26:58.251 --> 27:01.835
-Yeah, that was rough.
I'm really sorry.
-Oh!

27:01.919 --> 27:04.418
Anyway, do you have--
Did you get a shot as well?

27:04.502 --> 27:07.085
Um, no, that's okay.
I'm good. Thanks, though.

27:07.168 --> 27:09.293
Come on.
It's a tradition.

27:09.377 --> 27:10.794
You know, I mean,
you're the only one

27:10.877 --> 27:13.335
that seems to be any fun
around here anyway.

27:13.418 --> 27:15.877
-Um, no, thank you.
-All right.

27:17.377 --> 27:20.043
On the clock.
I get it.

27:21.168 --> 27:23.377
(Pete speaking
indistinctly over TV)

27:35.043 --> 27:36.794
Hey, Deborah, listen.

27:36.877 --> 27:38.960
I'm at the Club Condo
right up the street.

27:39.043 --> 27:42.251
If memory serves,
they got a bottle
of tequila back there.

27:42.335 --> 27:45.627
I think it's
even the good stuff,
might be a gold of sorts.

27:45.710 --> 27:48.835
I, uh, um...
I was thinking, um...

27:49.710 --> 27:51.585
You, me, you know.

27:52.210 --> 27:55.710
Uh, sorry. Do you need
anything else from me?

27:56.377 --> 27:57.960
No, no. I'm--
I'm not working.

27:58.043 --> 27:59.919
I'm off tomorrow,
which means you're off tomorrow,

28:00.001 --> 28:03.418
-which means we could really--
-Dude. Come on. Stop.

28:03.502 --> 28:05.126
(scoffs)
What? What do you mean?

28:05.210 --> 28:06.919
Come on. You know.

28:07.001 --> 28:08.919
Did you see that
fucking crowd tonight?

28:09.001 --> 28:11.960
What, are we supposed
to walk into the night alone?

28:12.043 --> 28:13.752
You know, I saw
your lower-back tattoo.

28:13.835 --> 28:16.919
-I know what you like,
dirty girl. Come here.
-Dude!

28:17.001 --> 28:19.168
Wake the fuck up,
okay?

28:19.251 --> 28:21.377
God, that kind of shit?
That's so over.

28:21.460 --> 28:24.001
-Jesus.
-Okay, we got
some wires crossed.

28:24.085 --> 28:26.919
No, fuck you!
Fuck you!

28:27.001 --> 28:29.210
Do you know what
the worst fucking job
in this whole club is?

28:29.293 --> 28:31.085
It's working
the fucking green room,

28:31.168 --> 28:34.543
because you guys think that
we all want to talk to you,
and we don't!

28:34.627 --> 28:36.251
-We really don't.
-All right, okay.

28:36.335 --> 28:39.210
So just leave me alone
and let me do my fucking job.

28:39.293 --> 28:41.043
-Okay?
-I hear ya. All right?

28:41.126 --> 28:44.043
I apolo...
Look, don't tell
Gavin, would ya?

28:44.126 --> 28:47.168
Because, you know,
I gotta work this club.
This is how I make a living.

28:47.251 --> 28:50.085
-Besides, you hit on me
in the first place.
-Oh, come on.

28:51.752 --> 28:53.960
-This fucking...
-(door slams)

28:58.293 --> 29:00.126
Pete (on TV):
...get too comfortable
swearing.

29:00.210 --> 29:03.502
Recently told my doctor,
I don't fuck with cheese.

29:03.585 --> 29:05.502
(audience laughing)

29:07.126 --> 29:09.293
(crickets chirring)

29:13.168 --> 29:14.502
Pete:
Hey.

29:16.710 --> 29:19.001
Do you, uh,
you wanna go?

29:20.543 --> 29:23.377
-Yeah.
-You okay?

29:27.752 --> 29:29.919
Fuck... No.

29:30.001 --> 29:33.251
-I-I...
-It's just one weekend, Jay.

29:33.335 --> 29:35.794
-It doesn't matter.
-You know they cut my pay?

29:35.877 --> 29:38.293
They paid me
as the middle act both nights.

29:39.669 --> 29:40.835
I'm sorry.

29:40.919 --> 29:42.585
(laughing):
Okay.

29:42.669 --> 29:43.752
(clears throat)

29:43.835 --> 29:45.418
This shit used to be
fun, Pete.

29:45.502 --> 29:47.794
It used to be...
It used to be dangerous.

29:47.877 --> 29:51.001
What do you think
Bill Hicks would do
if some broad complains?

29:51.085 --> 29:54.460
He'd give a fuck?
He'd flick a cigarette
at her tits.

29:54.543 --> 29:56.960
-Well...
-No! It's like,
if I were a fucking--

29:57.043 --> 29:59.752
If I were a biracial lesbian
doing the same material,

29:59.835 --> 30:01.210
that crowd would have
carried me around.

30:01.293 --> 30:02.669
They would've had
a parade for me.

30:02.752 --> 30:04.418
It's a shitty time to be
a straight white guy, Pete.

30:04.502 --> 30:08.752
-Oh, my fucking God.
-Oh, look who it is.
Samantha Bee, everybody.

30:08.835 --> 30:11.335
-I mean, really, dude?
-Really.

30:11.418 --> 30:15.418
Come on, man.
It's a hard time
to be a white guy?

30:16.210 --> 30:18.543
Have a little
accountability, okay?

30:18.627 --> 30:19.960
You're not the victim.

30:20.043 --> 30:21.627
And just because you're up there

30:21.710 --> 30:24.627
pacing around and wearing
a leather jacket,

30:24.710 --> 30:26.377
doesn't mean you're
telling it like it is.

30:26.460 --> 30:28.794
Who gives a fuck
what you think?
I like leather, okay?

30:28.877 --> 30:30.627
-Jay...
-And I'll tell you
something else.

30:30.710 --> 30:33.085
You burnt my fucking premises.
You don't do that
to another comic.

30:33.168 --> 30:37.001
Okay, well,
a comic does comedy.

30:37.085 --> 30:40.877
What you did was--
hmm, let me think...
hate speech?

30:40.960 --> 30:44.835
Let me tell you something.
When we wake up
from all this PC bullshit,

30:44.919 --> 30:46.627
we'll see what it looks
like for you then,

30:46.710 --> 30:50.043
you fucking Nescafe,
chamomile-sipping cunt.

30:50.126 --> 30:52.585
You know what, Jason?
You're a cunt.

30:52.669 --> 30:56.627
I am sorry that
you've been doing comedy
for 15 fucking years

30:56.710 --> 30:59.585
and all you have to show for it
is managing The Boston.

30:59.669 --> 31:02.502
Twenty-two years!

31:02.585 --> 31:04.085
Twenty-two!

31:11.627 --> 31:14.210
Okay, um...

31:14.293 --> 31:16.543
I think my Uber's here,

31:16.627 --> 31:18.126
so I'm gonna...

31:19.752 --> 31:21.126
See ya, Pete.

31:31.377 --> 31:33.293
Ah, look, you know...

31:33.377 --> 31:35.085
It's gonna be fine.

31:36.502 --> 31:38.960
Name of the game, right?
I mean...

31:39.043 --> 31:42.210
You come out to a club,
it doesn't always go your way.

31:42.293 --> 31:43.710
You take a little slap
on the wrist.

31:43.794 --> 31:46.126
You clean it up
for a couple of months.

31:47.460 --> 31:49.794
You're right back
in the game.

31:50.960 --> 31:52.502
(sighs)

31:52.585 --> 31:54.377
(exhales, grunts)

31:54.460 --> 31:58.168
All right, you're driving.
Middle. Middle drives, baby.

31:58.251 --> 31:59.752

Wow, thank you guys so much.
How are you guys doing?

It's wonderful to be here.
