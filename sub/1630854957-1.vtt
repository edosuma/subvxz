When I was very young,

00:29.812 --> 00:32.249
Sometimes I'’d lay
in bed at night...

00:32.423 --> 00:35.209
and imagined that my family
turned into monsters

00:35.383 --> 00:37.863
when I fell asleep.

00:38.038 --> 00:39.996
Listening to the hum
of urban traffic

00:40.170 --> 00:41.867
outside my window,

00:42.042 --> 00:44.435
I could picture them
having wild revelries,

00:44.609 --> 00:48.135
sure to explode
my 8-year-old mind.

00:48.309 --> 00:50.615
And, of course, there was
a thoroughly logical belief

00:50.789 --> 00:53.618
that they were fattening me up
just to eat me.

00:53.792 --> 00:57.144
Even now,
at the ripe old age of 16,

00:57.318 --> 00:59.798
I still catch myself
asking the same old question.

01:01.365 --> 01:02.714
Who are you people?

01:09.330 --> 01:12.289
And lately,
rather than recede,

01:12.463 --> 01:14.639
that question
only gets louder.

01:14.813 --> 01:16.685
Consider my father.

01:16.859 --> 01:19.209
He's a shark litigator,
who simultaneously craves

01:19.383 --> 01:21.820
both the nobility of laboring
for the disenfranchised

01:21.994 --> 01:24.432
and the splatter of blood
from those who dare oppose him.

01:25.694 --> 01:27.217
Perhaps that's why

01:27.391 --> 01:28.784
his emotional
communication switch

01:28.958 --> 01:30.090
is permanently stuck
on "yell."

01:30.264 --> 01:31.569
Alex, come on.

01:31.743 --> 01:32.440
You're going to
be late for school.

01:34.442 --> 01:36.052
[Alex] Especially
when reminded that

01:36.226 --> 01:39.186

actually looks 16.

01:39.360 --> 01:41.057

01:43.103 --> 01:46.497
[Alex] My mother,
meanwhile, enjoys smiling.

01:46.671 --> 01:49.718
She works in PR,
which is by its very nature,

01:49.892 --> 01:52.286
the most superficial
of superficial professions.

01:53.330 --> 01:54.984
Still,

01:55.158 --> 01:56.768

-Good to see you.

02:02.818 --> 02:04.385
[Alex] Publicly,
there's a direct correlation

02:04.559 --> 02:06.126
between said detachment

02:06.300 --> 02:07.431
and dead eyed
Cheshire cat grinning.

02:09.912 --> 02:12.436
Privately, that detachment
takes a different form.

02:12.958 --> 02:14.830
[Judith] Yeah, Carey and I
are taking the girls

02:15.004 --> 02:16.266

02:16.745 --> 02:19.095
Oh, yes.
A joy it shall be.

02:19.269 --> 02:21.402

let's make a night of it.

You're going to ruin
my floors.

[Alex] Something quieter.

02:31.847 --> 02:33.457

of the painting?

02:33.631 --> 02:35.329
A reminder

02:35.503 --> 02:36.504
she's never quite there.

02:44.381 --> 02:46.209
[Alex] She loves
my sisters, though.

02:46.383 --> 02:48.603
Their existence is basically
a family creation myth.

02:48.777 --> 02:50.735
Daddy,

02:50.909 --> 02:54.391
Uh, Mommy and I wanted to
have more babies.

02:54.565 --> 02:56.611
We tried
for years and years.

02:56.785 --> 03:00.092
[all] And years and years
and years and years.

03:00.267 --> 03:02.660
-And we saw so many doctors.
-[Carey] Oh!

03:03.183 --> 03:04.836
And then
we saw this one doctor,

03:05.010 --> 03:08.492
who took these teeny
little things called embryos,

03:08.666 --> 03:10.451
and they put that inside me.

03:11.103 --> 03:12.235
-Ew.
-[Judith] Mm-hmm.

03:12.409 --> 03:14.019
And then we found out

03:14.194 --> 03:15.673
we weren't going to have
just one baby.

03:15.847 --> 03:18.546
We were going to have
two babies.

03:18.720 --> 03:21.679
And that's how we got
you pair of chuckleheads.

03:21.853 --> 03:23.855

Maybe they're just easier.

What about Alex?

03:30.514 --> 03:32.342
Yes. What about me?

03:34.388 --> 03:35.432
You were no trouble.

03:39.567 --> 03:41.133
[Alex] On some level,

03:41.308 --> 03:43.745
I wonder whether
I keep silently asking

03:43.919 --> 03:46.443
and re-asking
that fundamental question

03:46.617 --> 03:48.576
of just
who you people are.

03:50.099 --> 03:52.362
Because every moment
they seem to be asking

03:52.536 --> 03:54.886
the same question of me.

-Dude.

04:15.516 --> 04:17.257
Nothing about you
is horrible, Alex.

04:17.431 --> 04:19.346
Rohan, I--
I literally have one friend

04:19.520 --> 04:20.782
left over from kindergarten

04:20.956 --> 04:22.479
and she doesn't even go here.

04:22.653 --> 04:25.047
Hence your charity lunches.

04:25.917 --> 04:27.919
Your place
in the social pecking order

04:28.093 --> 04:29.747
forever undefinable.

04:30.357 --> 04:32.315

Trust me.

I set aside six hours,

04:45.981 --> 04:46.982
Just to write.

04:47.896 --> 04:48.940

discipline yourself

04:51.465 --> 04:54.250

not so horrible.

05:31.026 --> 05:33.071
Are you sure it wasn't because
you're afraid of herpes?

05:33.942 --> 05:35.422
Because if it's herpes,
I totally get it.

05:35.596 --> 05:36.945
I'm terrified of herpes.

05:37.119 --> 05:38.773
Can you please
stop saying herpes?

05:38.947 --> 05:40.818
Yeah, it travels through
your saliva or your skin...

05:41.515 --> 05:43.430
and it doesn't even matter
if you use a condom,

05:43.604 --> 05:44.866

spreading out there,

-Get in the car.
-You can yell at me some more.

53:07.009 --> 53:08.141
You're going home tomorrow.

53:13.233 --> 53:15.148
[footsteps approaching]

53:17.585 --> 53:18.630
Hi.

53:18.804 --> 53:20.371
Dinner will be ready in five...

53:22.460 --> 53:23.591
minutes.

53:27.029 --> 53:30.163
[melancholic
piano instrumental]

54:02.935 --> 54:04.197
[Arthur] You stalker.

54:05.677 --> 54:09.376
So, shockingly,
I have fucked everything up.

54:09.855 --> 54:12.553
Well, at least you and your dad
were getting along well.

54:13.293 --> 54:14.468
[Alex scoffs]

54:14.642 --> 54:15.904
Yeah,
if by getting along well

54:16.078 --> 54:17.950
you mean
yelling at me a lot.

54:18.820 --> 54:20.213
Which I guess is, like,

54:20.387 --> 54:21.388
par for the course
of parents, right?

54:23.303 --> 54:25.218
He was probably scared
something had happened to you.

54:26.524 --> 54:28.003
He screamed
because he gives a shit.

54:30.745 --> 54:32.225
So how long
have you known you were gay?

54:33.792 --> 54:37.665
Okay, you're from a major
metropolitan city,

54:37.839 --> 54:39.276
so you've seen probably

54:39.450 --> 54:41.713
every weird form
of pansexuality out there.

54:41.887 --> 54:43.758
I mean, you have
probably fucked girls.

54:43.932 --> 54:46.108
Oh, yeah.
My life is just a big orgy.

54:46.283 --> 54:47.588
Yeah, I'm sure it is.

54:48.110 --> 54:49.721
-You didn't answer my question.
-You didn't answer mine.

54:50.635 --> 54:51.766
Have you hooked up
with a girl?

54:53.507 --> 54:54.813
Have you?

54:55.683 --> 54:56.945
I'm a godless fag, remember?

54:57.990 --> 54:59.034
[Alex] Really?

55:05.432 --> 55:06.477
-Alex--
-It's okay.

55:11.438 --> 55:13.222
Okay, I gotta go. [chuckles]

55:16.530 --> 55:17.879
Okay.

55:18.053 --> 55:22.623
[quiet, subtle piano
instrumental]

55:33.373 --> 55:35.941
You disappeared again.
Are you kidding me?

55:36.420 --> 55:37.682
Apparently not.

55:38.160 --> 55:40.206
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Where the hell did you go?

55:40.380 --> 55:42.643
-I was with Arthur.
-The gay kid?

55:42.817 --> 55:44.819
-Pretty sure he's not gay.
-How the hell do you know that?

55:44.993 --> 55:46.473
-How is that your business?
-You know, as long as

55:46.647 --> 55:47.692
you're in this house,
you do exactly--

55:47.866 --> 55:48.910
Oh, until tomorrow?

55:50.042 --> 55:51.130
Go to your room.

55:51.826 --> 55:53.828
-Go to your room.
-Oh, go to my room?

55:54.002 --> 55:56.353
That's so original, "Dad."

55:57.702 --> 55:58.746
[door shuts close]

56:01.749 --> 56:03.316
[sniffs and sighs]

56:06.232 --> 56:07.407
[chuckles]

56:10.932 --> 56:12.891
[sighs]

56:15.937 --> 56:17.330
[Karl sighs]

56:17.548 --> 56:21.378
[classical music playing
on record player]

56:27.688 --> 56:30.256
She shouldn't be here.
You should have sent her away.

56:31.779 --> 56:32.954
Excuse me?

56:39.352 --> 56:40.571
I lost control today.

56:42.181 --> 56:44.357
I saw him
and I lost control.

56:46.098 --> 56:47.404
If she knew who I am...

56:49.275 --> 56:51.886
-who I really am.
-Nobody is one thing, Karl.

56:52.931 --> 56:54.280
You most of all.

56:55.586 --> 56:57.805
Besides,
I know who you are.

56:59.807 --> 57:01.461
Listen...

57:01.635 --> 57:03.071
these are just challenges.

57:03.855 --> 57:05.291
You will get past them.

57:06.118 --> 57:08.076
-That's all part of His plan.
-[Karl sighs]

57:09.991 --> 57:12.167
Every bad thing
is part of some test?

57:13.952 --> 57:15.997
Are you sure you just
don't want to believe that?

57:16.650 --> 57:18.391
I believe it
because I believe it.

57:19.044 --> 57:20.437
That's what faith is.

57:21.438 --> 57:22.482
Now come on.

57:23.570 --> 57:24.745
You know what to do.

57:32.840 --> 57:34.276
[sighs]

57:50.945 --> 57:52.338
[knocking on door]

57:55.776 --> 57:57.430
Sarah's making
breakfast downstairs.

57:58.300 --> 57:59.476
Okay.

58:02.087 --> 58:04.393
I'm sorry I yelled at you.
I was worried.

58:05.612 --> 58:07.484
I shouldn't have
said that, uh...

58:11.270 --> 58:13.228
I shouldn't have made you think
your grandfather was dead.

58:14.882 --> 58:16.362
So...

58:16.536 --> 58:17.842
yeah.

58:18.756 --> 58:20.279
And you don't
have to, um...

58:21.498 --> 58:23.195
I don't want you to leave.

58:26.328 --> 58:28.505
I should get your number,
probably.

58:30.376 --> 58:31.725
-Okay.
-Okay.

58:34.598 --> 58:36.208
So, what, were you out
with that Arthur kid?

58:37.775 --> 58:39.167
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

58:40.168 --> 58:41.735
Yeah, okay. All right.

58:46.958 --> 58:48.220
Do you have
any questions about sex

58:48.394 --> 58:49.526
-you want to ask me?
-[giggles]

58:50.178 --> 58:51.310
What?

58:52.006 --> 58:53.530
-From you?
-Yeah.

58:55.270 --> 58:56.881
Ew. [chuckles]

59:02.539 --> 59:04.236
[Karl] And no more
of this "I suck" shit.

59:05.977 --> 59:07.065
You don't.

59:10.155 --> 59:11.548
You don't because I said so.

59:25.953 --> 59:29.696
[soft instrumental playing]

59:48.541 --> 59:51.892
-So how's your mom?
-[Alex chuckles]

59:52.066 --> 59:53.590
Are we allowed
to have this conversation?

59:55.113 --> 59:56.767
It might
compromise your mystery.

59:59.683 --> 1:00:00.771
Serves me right.

1:00:07.473 --> 1:00:08.822
So I made out
with my teacher.

1:00:14.741 --> 1:00:15.916
Okay.

1:00:17.178 --> 1:00:18.310
You gonna get all weird?

1:00:20.225 --> 1:00:21.400
No.

1:00:22.967 --> 1:00:24.229
Yeah, it was
impulsive and dumb.

1:00:24.838 --> 1:00:27.014
[sighs] And of course,
Carey and Judith

1:00:27.188 --> 1:00:29.060
walked in on us,
which is even more mortifying

1:00:29.234 --> 1:00:31.715
than describing it
to you right now. [sighs]

1:00:31.889 --> 1:00:33.760
-Well, I didn't ask you.
-Well, I'm trying to explain.

1:00:36.589 --> 1:00:38.156
Anyways, they're,
like, super pissed.

1:00:38.896 --> 1:00:40.288
But they didn't even,
like, ask me why.

1:00:41.072 --> 1:00:42.551
They were just like,

1:00:42.726 --> 1:00:43.727
"Oh, yeah,
there goes our idiot daughter

1:00:43.901 --> 1:00:45.206
being a jackass again."

1:00:45.772 --> 1:00:48.296
They didn't respect me enough
to want to know why.

1:00:52.474 --> 1:00:55.042
-So they're not perfect.
-It's an understatement.

1:00:57.479 --> 1:00:59.612
[sighs] Better than some.

1:01:03.181 --> 1:01:05.357
[Sarah] Alex, Karl! Dinner!

1:01:05.531 --> 1:01:06.706
[both] Coming!

1:01:24.158 --> 1:01:27.161
[phone buzzing]

1:01:30.512 --> 1:01:31.992
Alex, are you okay?

1:01:32.558 --> 1:01:33.951
Yeah.

1:01:34.125 --> 1:01:35.300
What's up?

1:01:36.736 --> 1:01:39.043
Your dad's asleep.
What's going on?

1:01:40.087 --> 1:01:44.048
Mom, um,
were you ever in a band?

1:01:44.222 --> 1:01:45.702
-What? [chuckles]
-[Alex] Okay.

1:01:46.354 --> 1:01:49.183
I know this isn't, like,
the most opportune time to ask,

1:01:49.357 --> 1:01:52.056
but did you ever, like,
play in a rock band?

1:01:53.100 --> 1:01:57.714
Well, before you were born,
I did lots of things.

1:01:57.888 --> 1:01:58.932
[Alex] You never told me.

1:01:59.106 --> 1:02:00.412
You didn't ask.

1:02:00.586 --> 1:02:01.718
I totally asked.

1:02:02.283 --> 1:02:05.156
We were called
My Friend's Band.

1:02:05.330 --> 1:02:07.419
-[Alex] [chuckles] Seriously?
-Yeah.

1:02:07.593 --> 1:02:10.074
And my friend, Marco,
he was the lead singer,

1:02:10.248 --> 1:02:13.991
he said that the hot chick
had to play the bass, so.

1:02:14.165 --> 1:02:16.254
-Wait, you were the hot chick?
-[Judith] Hey.

1:02:16.776 --> 1:02:18.517
You try squeezing out
three kids.

1:02:18.691 --> 1:02:20.388
See how you look.

1:02:20.562 --> 1:02:21.650
[Alex] I forgot to tell you,
I'm pregnant.

1:02:21.825 --> 1:02:25.524
[Alex and Judith chuckling]

1:02:25.698 --> 1:02:27.874
Obviously, I'm kidding.
[Alex chuckling]

1:02:28.048 --> 1:02:30.747
I mean, not the best joke,
you know?

1:02:33.619 --> 1:02:35.403
Mom, are you there?

1:02:37.275 --> 1:02:38.363
Hey, Alex.

1:02:38.537 --> 1:02:39.756
Yeah?

1:02:46.458 --> 1:02:47.807
How's school going?

1:02:48.808 --> 1:02:51.115
Good.
It's going good.

1:02:51.289 --> 1:02:53.552
How's your roommate,
what was her name again?

1:02:53.726 --> 1:02:55.380
The one that has
night terrors?

1:02:55.554 --> 1:02:56.773
Night terrors?

1:02:57.643 --> 1:03:01.560
Oh, uh, right, um, Natalka.

1:03:01.734 --> 1:03:03.780
I think she's, like,
Ukrainian or something.

1:03:04.955 --> 1:03:06.739
[whispering] Speaking of which,
she's sleeping right now,

1:03:06.913 --> 1:03:08.132
so I have to go.

1:03:20.187 --> 1:03:23.495
[phone ringing]

1:03:25.627 --> 1:03:26.715
Hello?

1:03:27.891 --> 1:03:29.718
Oh, Mrs. Fixel.
What can I do for you?

1:03:34.854 --> 1:03:37.596
[phone buzzing]

1:03:39.903 --> 1:03:41.513
-Hi, Dad.
-Are you all right?

1:03:41.687 --> 1:03:44.472
-Where are you?
-Dad, stop yelling.

1:03:44.646 --> 1:03:46.039
-I'm fine.
-The hell you're fine.

1:03:46.213 --> 1:03:47.911
Where are you, Alex?

1:03:48.085 --> 1:03:50.261
Alex, please.
Please, just-- where are you?

1:03:50.435 --> 1:03:52.132
-Tell us where you are.
-[Alex] I'm fine.

1:03:52.306 --> 1:03:54.178
-I'm with a friend.
-She said she's with a friend.

1:03:54.352 --> 1:03:56.006
She doesn't have
any fucking friends, hold on.

1:03:56.180 --> 1:03:57.703
Can you tell dad
not to have an aneurysm?

1:03:57.877 --> 1:03:59.705
[Corey] Hey.

1:03:59.879 --> 1:04:01.402
How long did you think that
you were going to keep this up?

1:04:01.576 --> 1:04:02.969
Hm?

1:04:03.143 --> 1:04:04.797
What exactly is your plan here?

1:04:04.971 --> 1:04:07.104
Do you think about
anybody but yourself?

1:04:07.278 --> 1:04:10.803
Do you imagine any
consequences of your actions?

1:04:10.977 --> 1:04:13.197
Because
you are in so much trouble--

1:04:27.211 --> 1:04:28.429
Let's order some food.

1:04:32.085 --> 1:04:33.130
Come on.

1:04:36.698 --> 1:04:38.787
[emotional
instrumental playing]

1:04:38.962 --> 1:04:40.137
[Alex sniffles]

1:04:44.837 --> 1:04:46.186
Son of a bitch.

1:04:51.626 --> 1:04:53.759
Yes, this is Sheriff
Reggie Stratford

1:04:53.933 --> 1:04:56.109
calling from
Newburgh in Washington.

1:05:00.113 --> 1:05:01.506
The phone call
seemed to spook you.

1:05:03.290 --> 1:05:04.335
What happened?

1:05:05.684 --> 1:05:06.903
I may have to go back soon.

1:05:07.991 --> 1:05:09.166
It's home stuff.

1:05:12.909 --> 1:05:14.780
The Sheriff
said some things.

1:05:17.565 --> 1:05:19.393
I'm not proud of
what happened with Brandon.

1:05:21.395 --> 1:05:23.441
But he was bothering
a girl that night, and...

1:05:24.746 --> 1:05:27.053
it was two drunk hotheads
fighting and I won.

1:05:29.534 --> 1:05:30.883
But there's other things
that happened--

1:05:31.057 --> 1:05:32.537
[Alex]
Maybe I don't need to know.

1:05:32.711 --> 1:05:33.930
I thought I did,
but maybe I don't want to know

1:05:34.104 --> 1:05:36.019
because I like you now.

1:05:39.674 --> 1:05:41.850
[delivery guy]
Hey, Karl. Got the food.

1:05:42.721 --> 1:05:43.809
-Two burgers.
-Yes, sir.

1:05:43.983 --> 1:05:45.202
Burgers? Are you serious?

1:05:47.204 --> 1:05:48.335
Ew.

1:05:48.901 --> 1:05:50.033
[delivery guy] Who is this?

1:05:52.252 --> 1:05:53.558
That's my daughter, Alex.

1:05:56.778 --> 1:05:58.650
[muffled shouting]

1:05:58.824 --> 1:06:00.434
[Alex shouting]
I regret nothing!

1:06:00.608 --> 1:06:01.914
You could have
at least tried it.

1:06:02.088 --> 1:06:03.698
No. Are you kidding me?

1:06:03.872 --> 1:06:04.873
My friend Nancy didn't eat meat
for five years...

1:06:05.048 --> 1:06:06.092
-And?
-...and she had

1:06:06.266 --> 1:06:07.528
a chicken cutlet of sandwich

1:06:07.702 --> 1:06:09.661
and she vomited
all over herself.

1:06:14.622 --> 1:06:17.495
Alex hasn't been
entirely honest with us.

1:06:23.327 --> 1:06:25.807
You're looking
at possible kidnapping,

1:06:25.982 --> 1:06:27.461
and you're crossing
state lines--

1:06:27.635 --> 1:06:28.897
[Alex]
Shit, shit, shit, shit. Fuck--

1:06:29.072 --> 1:06:30.595
Please, Alex, language.

1:06:30.769 --> 1:06:33.119
-God damn it, fuck!
-[Sarah] Alex, enough!

1:06:33.293 --> 1:06:36.166
You called them?
Why would you call them?

1:06:37.558 --> 1:06:39.430
-It's my job?
-[Alex] Shit, shit, shit.

1:06:39.604 --> 1:06:41.606
Listen, I lied to everyone.
Karl had no idea I snuck away.

1:06:41.780 --> 1:06:43.129
It's my fault, okay?

1:06:43.303 --> 1:06:45.131
I'm a fucking idiot.
I'm a fucking--

1:06:45.305 --> 1:06:46.959
-It's not-- you're not--
-Hey, hey, hey.

1:06:48.439 --> 1:06:49.483
Hey.

1:06:50.789 --> 1:06:51.833
I'm going to be okay.

1:06:52.530 --> 1:06:53.748
Okay?
Everything's going to be fine.

1:06:58.492 --> 1:06:59.537
Sheriff Stratford.

1:07:02.540 --> 1:07:03.976
