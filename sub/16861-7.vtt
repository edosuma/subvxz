WEBVTT

00:00.400 --> 00:02.317
<i>previously, on rescue me...</i>

00:02.352 --> 00:04.234
Tommy, we're stuck! You

00:04.269 --> 00:04.866
got to hurry.

00:04.901 --> 00:05.734
OK. I'm on my way. I'm on

00:05.769 --> 00:06.399
my way.

00:06.434 --> 00:07.199
I screwed up tonight.

00:07.234 --> 00:08.167
I almost took me and franko

00:08.202 --> 00:09.065
out.

00:09.100 --> 00:09.732
you're nacho.

00:09.767 --> 00:11.617
that's right, asshole.

00:11.652 --> 00:13.109
What the hell was that?

00:13.144 --> 00:14.567
I think that was my new

00:14.602 --> 00:15.399
boyfriend.

00:15.434 --> 00:16.667
Jerry, I need ice. How many

00:16.702 --> 00:17.785
times do I have to ask?

00:17.820 --> 00:18.833
relax, sweetheart. Right

00:18.868 --> 00:20.033
after the puke. I thought you

00:20.068 --> 00:20.767
said I was going to be a

00:20.802 --> 00:21.432
bartender.

00:21.467 --> 00:22.265
be patient, Jerry. The

00:22.300 --> 00:23.267
checks are being processed.

00:23.302 --> 00:24.234
You'll be pouring before you

00:24.269 --> 00:24.933
know it.

00:24.968 --> 00:25.901
I want us to be together

00:25.936 --> 00:27.098
forever.

00:27.133 --> 00:28.367
I'll see what I can do about

00:28.402 --> 00:29.032
that.

00:29.067 --> 00:29.884
the chick I've been seeing,

00:29.919 --> 00:30.701
man. She took my little girl,

00:30.736 --> 00:31.866
man. She took Keela.

00:31.901 --> 00:32.917
oh, man. You didn't tell her

00:32.952 --> 00:33.826
about the foster family?

00:33.861 --> 00:34.714
yeah. I did. All right? It

00:34.749 --> 00:35.508
slipped out in conversation.

00:35.543 --> 00:36.338
How the hell was I supposed to

00:36.373 --> 00:37.133
know she'd use it against me,

00:37.168 --> 00:37.766
huh?

00:37.801 --> 00:38.867
hey. I was thinking since

00:38.902 --> 00:39.934
you're off tonight that, um,

00:39.969 --> 00:42.234
maybe we might talk.

00:42.269 --> 00:43.032
for what?

00:43.067 --> 00:43.933
the crying jags.

00:43.968 --> 00:47.701
jag. OK? It was one time.

00:47.736 --> 00:48.852
Shit.

00:48.887 --> 00:49.968
uhh!

00:53.734 --> 00:55.399
colleen's been in some

00:55.434 --> 00:56.817
trouble at school. So, they

00:56.852 --> 00:58.376
want her to see a counselor. I

00:58.411 --> 00:59.589
would really appreciate it if

00:59.624 --> 01:00.767
you went with her to the first

01:00.802 --> 01:01.699
session.

01:01.734 --> 01:02.634
I marry her. I get to have

01:02.669 --> 01:03.632
conjugal visits?

01:03.667 --> 01:04.434
once every 10 days for an

01:04.468 --> 01:05.532
hour at a time.

01:05.567 --> 01:06.801
perfect. You got any breath

01:06.836 --> 01:07.666
spray?

01:07.701 --> 01:09.734
I think what you did is what

01:09.769 --> 01:11.318
needed to be done.

01:11.353 --> 01:13.627
will you marry me?

01:13.662 --> 01:15.901
holy shit. Rufies and

01:15.936 --> 01:16.799
viagra.

01:16.834 --> 01:17.833
what are rufies?

01:17.868 --> 01:19.100
it's the date rape drug.

01:19.135 --> 01:19.965
eww!

01:20.000 --> 01:20.666
I got to work.

01:20.701 --> 01:21.567
they couldn't get someone

01:21.602 --> 01:22.365
else to cover?

01:22.400 --> 01:23.517
they all got seniority.

01:23.552 --> 01:24.634
you got to get out of that

01:24.669 --> 01:25.332
house.

01:25.367 --> 01:26.867
we show up there, we totally

01:26.902 --> 01:28.218
act like we're together. By

01:28.253 --> 01:29.410
11:00 tonight, you can't keep

01:29.445 --> 01:30.623
your hands off the phone. Johnny

01:30.658 --> 01:31.801
and Janet are cursing our souls

01:31.836 --> 01:33.318
to eternal hell. She's

01:33.353 --> 01:34.801
watching us, right?

01:34.836 --> 01:35.484
oh, really?

01:35.519 --> 01:36.160
so kiss...

01:36.195 --> 01:36.831
mm-hmm.

01:36.866 --> 01:37.499
grope...

01:37.534 --> 01:38.098
mm-hmm.

01:38.133 --> 01:38.800
ass grab...

01:38.835 --> 01:39.484
mm-hmm.

01:39.519 --> 01:40.098
tit rub.

01:40.133 --> 01:41.433
mm-hmm. There's no way

01:41.468 --> 01:42.534
shirley got a hold of her.

01:42.569 --> 01:43.601
well, who else would give a

01:43.636 --> 01:44.567
shit?

01:51.000 --> 01:51.933
hey.

01:51.968 --> 01:53.000
hey, boys.

01:53.035 --> 01:53.732
hey.

01:53.767 --> 01:54.617
what's, uh, what's going on?

01:54.652 --> 01:55.467
uh, the porn police are

01:55.502 --> 01:56.400
upstairs, Chief.

01:56.435 --> 01:57.365
oh, shit.

01:57.400 --> 01:58.732
yeah. 4 guys from hq. One

01:58.767 --> 02:00.150
guy supervisor and 3 guys doing

02:00.185 --> 02:01.359
the sweep. Absolute bullshit.

02:01.394 --> 02:02.713
typical. The public pays 4

02:02.748 --> 02:03.924
guys to sniff out porno.

02:03.959 --> 02:05.113
unbelievable. And we can't

02:05.148 --> 02:06.267
get new ropes. That's great.

02:06.302 --> 02:07.984
That's really great.

02:08.019 --> 02:09.667
yeah. Ridiculous.

02:09.702 --> 02:10.899
flynn?

02:10.934 --> 02:12.734
hey, jer. How's it hanging?

02:12.769 --> 02:13.766
holy shit!

02:13.801 --> 02:15.134
That's what they got you doing

02:15.169 --> 02:16.985
now? Flynn and I started back in

02:17.020 --> 02:18.801
the bronx back in the day. Well,

02:18.836 --> 02:20.185
look at you know, huh? Just

02:20.220 --> 02:21.610
pushing the pencil. Running all

02:21.645 --> 02:22.956
over the city. Trying to make

02:22.991 --> 02:24.579
sure that good men like my crew

02:24.614 --> 02:26.167
here aren't rubbing one off on

02:26.202 --> 02:27.432
the city's dime, huh?

02:27.467 --> 02:28.550
I'm just doing what I'm told.

02:28.585 --> 02:29.543
yeah, and there's a lot of

02:29.578 --> 02:30.706
honor in that. Ain't there,

02:30.741 --> 02:32.054
flynn? You take your little

02:32.089 --> 02:33.295
clipboard, you go on downtown

02:33.330 --> 02:34.615
back to headquarters and you

02:34.650 --> 02:35.958
tell whoever it was that sent

02:35.993 --> 02:37.730
you up here that they can kiss

02:37.765 --> 02:39.133
my white Irish ass. This is the

02:39.168 --> 02:40.584
bravest bunch of guys I've ever

02:40.619 --> 02:42.009
had the honor of serving with.

02:42.044 --> 02:43.489
These guys are gold when it

02:43.524 --> 02:44.934
comes to saving people's lives

02:44.969 --> 02:45.998
and protecting their

02:46.033 --> 02:47.566
property, not to mention the 5

02:47.601 --> 02:48.834
names on the plaque on that wall

02:48.869 --> 02:50.335
out there. Guys that went into

02:50.370 --> 02:52.669
those 2 towers on that day and

02:52.704 --> 02:54.752
never came back. So, if within

02:54.787 --> 02:56.893
the sacred confines of these 4

02:56.928 --> 02:58.480
walls makes you want to look at

02:58.515 --> 03:00.324
something else other than that

03:00.359 --> 03:02.098
shit, that's fine with me.

03:02.133 --> 03:03.233
They want to smoke, they want to

03:03.268 --> 03:04.984
jerk off, they want to shove

03:05.019 --> 03:06.393
potato chips up their ass, I

03:06.428 --> 03:07.814
don't give a shit, as long as

03:07.849 --> 03:08.908
they keep getting on that rig

03:08.943 --> 03:09.933
and going out the door and

03:09.968 --> 03:14.000
saving lives, I'll back 'em up.

03:14.035 --> 03:15.799
what we got?

03:15.834 --> 03:17.150
there's no porn, sir. No

03:17.185 --> 03:18.432
tapes. No magazines.

03:18.467 --> 03:19.867
damn sorry it was a wasted

03:19.902 --> 03:21.267
trip. Now, get out of my

03:21.302 --> 03:22.667
goddamn quarters.

03:22.702 --> 03:23.933
let's go.

03:23.968 --> 03:24.766
make sure down at

03:24.801 --> 03:25.801
headquarters you tell them Chief

03:25.836 --> 03:27.534
Jerry riley from the 15th

03:27.569 --> 03:28.332
battalion.

03:28.367 --> 03:33.133
let's go to the next one.

03:33.168 --> 03:34.098
way to go, Chief.

03:34.133 --> 03:34.801
oh, come on. Cut it out.

03:34.836 --> 03:35.599
Cut it out.

03:35.634 --> 03:36.400
nicely done, Chief. Now let

03:36.435 --> 03:37.132
me ask a question. Did you

03:37.167 --> 03:38.400
really mean what you said about

03:38.435 --> 03:39.634
us being able to smoke and jerk

03:39.669 --> 03:40.768
off and everything?

03:40.803 --> 03:41.833
why, of course.

03:41.868 --> 03:42.851
good. Because there's a bag

03:42.886 --> 03:44.176
of potato chips in the kitchen

03:44.211 --> 03:45.289
with my ass' name all over it.

03:45.324 --> 03:46.367
I don't know where that came

03:46.402 --> 03:47.098
from.

03:47.133 --> 03:48.066
by the way, the Chief just

03:48.101 --> 03:48.934
went balls to the wall for us,

03:48.969 --> 03:49.868
guys. This is officially the

03:49.903 --> 03:51.018
last fun firehouse in new York

03:51.053 --> 03:52.133
city. I hope you appreciate it.

03:52.168 --> 03:52.965
thanks, Chief.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.232
all right, you guys.

03:54.267 --> 03:56.767
hey, uh, so what's the deal?

03:56.802 --> 03:59.267
what are you talking about?

03:59.302 --> 04:00.601
come on. The porno.

04:00.636 --> 04:01.499
yeah.

04:01.534 --> 04:02.400
I don't know what you're

04:02.435 --> 04:03.098
talking about.

04:03.133 --> 04:04.067
you guys wouldn't be stupid

04:04.102 --> 04:05.067
enough to, uh...

04:12.834 --> 04:14.467
* on another day,

04:14.502 --> 04:16.065
come on, come on,

04:16.100 --> 04:17.701
with these ropes I tied,

04:17.736 --> 04:19.334
can we do no wrong?

04:19.369 --> 04:20.833
Now we grieve

04:20.868 --> 04:22.484
'cause now is gone,

04:22.519 --> 04:24.226
things were good

04:24.261 --> 04:25.899
when we were young,

04:25.934 --> 04:27.334
with my teeth locked down

04:27.369 --> 04:28.918
I can see the blood

04:28.953 --> 04:30.432
of a thousand men

04:30.467 --> 04:32.334
who have come and gone,

04:32.369 --> 04:33.699
now we grieve

04:33.734 --> 04:35.367
'cause now is gone,

04:35.402 --> 04:36.951
things were good

04:36.986 --> 04:38.576
when we were young,

04:38.611 --> 04:40.206
is it safe to say?

04:40.241 --> 04:41.766
Come on, come on,

04:41.801 --> 04:43.501
was it right to leave?

04:43.536 --> 04:45.151
Come on, come on,

04:45.186 --> 04:46.776
will I ever learn?

04:46.811 --> 04:48.439
Come on, come on,

04:48.474 --> 04:50.154
come on, come on,

04:50.189 --> 04:51.799
come on, come on *

04:58.101 --> 05:00.867
- I don't even know why I'm here.
- Are you happy, colleen?

05:00.902 --> 05:02.366
I'm fine.

05:02.401 --> 05:04.301
can you tell me why you've

05:04.336 --> 05:05.532
been acting out in an

05:05.567 --> 05:07.334
antl-social manner recently?

05:07.369 --> 05:08.801
I don't know what you mean.

05:08.836 --> 05:11.234
well, you slapped a classmate

05:11.269 --> 05:13.218
last Thursday and you recently

05:13.253 --> 05:15.127
told your French teacher to

05:15.162 --> 05:17.548
stick the textbook up her ass.

05:17.583 --> 05:19.899
OK. In her defense, we've

05:19.934 --> 05:22.001
already spoken to her about the

05:22.036 --> 05:22.999
classmate thing. She

05:23.034 --> 05:24.833
knows that that's wrong. You

05:24.868 --> 05:26.534
can't do it. You can't go around

05:26.569 --> 05:28.201
slapping people. Right? So, I

05:28.236 --> 05:30.051
think we've taken care of that.

05:30.086 --> 05:31.867
And as regards to the teacher,

05:31.902 --> 05:39.166
I mean, she is French.

05:39.201 --> 05:41.533
Uh, she knows that's wrong, too.

05:41.568 --> 05:44.100
We spoke about that.

05:44.135 --> 05:46.598
So, you can't, uh...

05:46.633 --> 05:48.100
you lost your little brother

05:48.135 --> 05:49.351
about 6 months ago. Do you

05:49.386 --> 05:50.567
think that has anything to do

05:50.602 --> 05:51.399
with it?

05:51.434 --> 05:53.234
I miss him. It makes me sad.

05:53.269 --> 05:54.835
I used to cry a lot about it but

05:54.870 --> 05:57.468
it didn't change things. So, I

05:57.503 --> 05:59.402
stopped. I'm fine. Can I go?

05:59.437 --> 06:01.301
colleen, I want to help you

06:01.336 --> 06:02.568
process whatever...

06:02.603 --> 06:03.800
process these, bitch.

Hey, give me a couple of

06:45.452 --> 06:47.600
fairly good grasp on psychiatric

06:47.635 --> 06:49.067
conditions and treatments.

06:49.102 --> 06:52.134
OK, 'cause, uh...

06:52.169 --> 06:55.132
she cries a lot.

06:55.167 --> 06:56.399
why are you whispering?

06:56.434 --> 06:57.700
I don't want her to hear me

06:57.735 --> 06:59.099
talking about her.

06:59.134 --> 07:00.699
I don't work this way.

07:00.734 --> 07:03.700
all right. Give me a second.

07:03.735 --> 07:06.667
hey, go wait in the truck,

07:06.702 --> 07:07.299
OK?

07:07.334 --> 07:08.134
I don't want to wait in the

07:08.169 --> 07:08.765
truck.

07:08.800 --> 07:09.433
go wait...

07:09.468 --> 07:10.299
I don't want to wait...

07:10.334 --> 07:11.284
hey! Don't make me tell you

07:11.319 --> 07:12.743
3 times. Go wait in the goddamn

07:12.778 --> 07:17.123
truck. Always with the lip.

07:17.158 --> 07:21.662
Jesus! Teenagers. Anyways...

07:21.697 --> 07:24.798
she has these crying jags, you

07:24.833 --> 07:26.883
know. She just starts crying

07:26.918 --> 07:28.542
completely out of the blue. I

07:28.577 --> 07:29.705
mean, you know, it's just

07:29.740 --> 07:30.834
driving around and all of a

07:30.869 --> 07:31.532
sudden...

07:31.567 --> 07:33.167
she's old enough to drive?

07:33.202 --> 07:34.732
I'm driving. She's, uh,

07:34.767 --> 07:37.484
shotgun. And she'll just burst

07:37.519 --> 07:39.709
into tears for no reason. What

07:39.744 --> 07:41.900
do you think that's about?

07:41.935 --> 07:42.967
you're driving?

07:43.002 --> 07:44.498
yep.

07:44.533 --> 07:46.383
uh-huh. Well, it could be

07:46.418 --> 07:48.234
any number of things.

07:48.269 --> 07:49.532
OK. The top 3.

07:49.567 --> 07:51.800
could be hormonal. She's a

07:51.835 --> 07:54.367
young girl. Body's changing.

07:54.402 --> 07:56.900
no. No. Not that. What's the

07:56.935 --> 07:57.932
number 2?

07:57.967 --> 07:59.066
she's a person who has

07:59.101 --> 08:00.934
trouble expressing her emotions.

08:00.969 --> 08:02.401
The crying could be a very

08:02.436 --> 08:03.565
natural release...

08:03.600 --> 08:05.000
she's a Gavin. She's a female

08:05.035 --> 08:06.366
Gavin. So, expressing her

08:06.401 --> 08:08.467
emotions is something that just

08:08.502 --> 08:10.084
happens 24/7. so, even when

08:10.119 --> 08:11.526
she's sleeping. So, it can't be

08:11.561 --> 08:12.934
that one. What's the other?

08:12.969 --> 08:14.001
What's the third?

08:14.036 --> 08:15.034
could be survivor's

08:15.069 --> 08:16.232
guilt.

08:16.267 --> 08:18.199
what's that?

08:18.234 --> 08:20.200
some people, when someone

08:20.235 --> 08:22.151
very close to them dies, they

08:22.186 --> 08:24.293
feel a tremendous and, in some

08:24.328 --> 08:26.097
cases, crippling sense of guilt.

08:26.132 --> 08:27.716
"I should have done more to help

08:27.751 --> 08:29.359
them. It should have been me,

08:29.394 --> 08:30.881
not them. If I couldn't help

08:30.916 --> 08:32.591
them, then why do I deserve to

08:32.626 --> 08:34.179
live?" and if these feelings

08:34.215 --> 08:35.857
aren't addressed and if they

08:35.892 --> 08:37.328
aren't dealt with, then they

08:37.364 --> 08:38.767
could just manifest themselves

08:38.802 --> 08:40.565
in a variety of ways.

08:40.600 --> 08:42.133
that's the one. That's it.

08:42.168 --> 08:44.634
That's definitely it. That's

08:44.669 --> 08:46.768
what's wrong with her. So, what

08:46.803 --> 08:48.867
pills do we give her now to take

08:48.902 --> 08:49.732
care of that?

08:49.767 --> 08:50.817
Mr. Gavin, I really don't

08:50.852 --> 08:51.867
believe in medicating young

08:51.902 --> 08:52.799
adults.

08:52.834 --> 08:54.183
oh, and neither do I. I'm

08:54.218 --> 08:55.892
right with you on that. I'd,

08:55.927 --> 08:57.630
you know, cut the pills in half

08:57.665 --> 08:59.334
and give her, you know, half the

08:59.369 --> 09:02.366
dosage.

09:02.401 --> 09:05.134
OK. Well, thanks, doc.

09:05.169 --> 09:08.301
I appreciate it.

09:08.336 --> 09:09.433
What?

09:09.468 --> 09:12.901
What did I tell you? Huh? God

09:12.936 --> 09:15.085
damn it. In the truck now.

09:15.120 --> 09:17.234
we're talking about 1,800

09:17.269 --> 09:18.168
bucks here, guys.

09:18.203 --> 09:19.032
yeah, maybe more.

09:19.067 --> 09:20.383
1,850. last time I checked

09:20.418 --> 09:21.700
yesterday, first thing in the

09:21.735 --> 09:22.465
door.

09:22.500 --> 09:23.317
you know, guys, I'm truly

09:23.352 --> 09:24.134
loathe to say this 'cause the

09:24.169 --> 09:24.799
last thing I want is

09:24.834 --> 09:26.284
a filthy motherless dog or cat

09:26.319 --> 09:27.676
raping whores in here. But I

09:27.711 --> 09:29.034
think we need to call the cops.

09:29.069 --> 09:30.032
what's going on?

09:30.067 --> 09:31.134
somebody stole the can.

09:31.169 --> 09:32.032
the toilet?

09:32.067 --> 09:32.799
no. The can. The smoking

09:32.834 --> 09:34.201
kitty. I mean, what was in the

09:34.236 --> 09:35.567
kitty. $1,800.

09:35.602 --> 09:36.565
$1,850.

09:36.600 --> 09:37.433
you're shitting me!

09:37.468 --> 09:38.284
all right, guys. You know

09:38.319 --> 09:39.226
what? I hate to say this, but

09:39.261 --> 09:40.197
you know who maybe possibly

09:40.232 --> 09:41.134
could have taken it? The guys

09:41.169 --> 09:42.232
who were on last night.

09:42.267 --> 09:43.200
hey! Jesus, frank. These are

09:43.235 --> 09:44.201
our brothers. OK? We share this

09:44.236 --> 09:45.167
house with them. There's no way

09:45.202 --> 09:46.068
they did this.

09:46.103 --> 09:46.899
how do you know?

09:46.934 --> 09:47.665
'cause I already accused

09:47.700 --> 09:48.833
them. Irish John said the can

09:48.868 --> 09:50.451
was empty when they got here.

09:50.486 --> 09:52.034
and you know who it is? Porno

09:52.069 --> 09:52.632
squad.

09:52.667 --> 09:53.565
oh, my God. Yeah.

09:53.600 --> 09:54.367
those are the only guys who

09:54.402 --> 09:55.099
had access. They had the

09:55.134 --> 09:56.101
upstairs and downstairs all to

09:56.136 --> 09:56.832
themselves.

09:56.867 --> 09:57.683
you know what? They couldn't

09:57.718 --> 09:58.500
get our porn, so they took our

09:58.535 --> 09:59.201
money.

09:59.236 --> 09:59.832
exactly.

09:59.867 --> 10:00.498
well, what do we do?

10:00.533 --> 10:01.283
I talk to the Chief and see

10:01.318 --> 10:02.034
if he can talk to his friend

10:02.069 --> 10:02.701
flynny.

10:02.736 --> 10:03.385
cue ball.

10:03.420 --> 10:03.999
yeah.

10:04.034 --> 10:05.234
I saw Keela last night.

10:05.269 --> 10:06.498
yeah? Where?

10:06.533 --> 10:07.765
out by Alicia's place. I

10:07.800 --> 10:09.166
stopped by to drop off some toys

10:09.201 --> 10:10.467
and a bunch of clothes. Not like

10:10.502 --> 10:11.734
she needs any of that shit now.

10:11.769 --> 10:13.134
watch your step there.

10:13.169 --> 10:14.218
yeah. You should see her

10:14.253 --> 10:15.460
room, man. You could land an

10:15.495 --> 10:16.848
airplane in that damn place.

10:16.883 --> 10:18.201
well, lucky kid, right?

10:18.236 --> 10:19.501
yeah. I guess so.

10:19.536 --> 10:20.732
watch your step.

10:20.767 --> 10:21.700
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

10:21.735 --> 10:22.617
you got it?

10:22.652 --> 10:23.943
yep. Got it.

10:23.978 --> 10:24.956
OK. All right.

10:24.991 --> 10:25.899
there it is.

10:25.934 --> 10:27.850
put it over here.

10:27.885 --> 10:29.732
yeah, daddy. Nice.

10:29.767 --> 10:31.900
hey, uh, Tommy, do you know

10:31.935 --> 10:33.668
who dave the dude is?

10:33.703 --> 10:35.366
oh, yeah. From 68 truck.

10:35.401 --> 10:36.633
yeah. Got a call from him the

10:36.668 --> 10:37.334
other night...

10:37.369 --> 10:37.966
yeah?

10:38.001 --> 10:38.699
said he was at some bar

10:38.734 --> 10:39.817
downtown, he saw Chief pumping

10:39.852 --> 10:41.043
boxes from front to back, you

10:41.078 --> 10:42.022
know. Taking away the empties.

10:42.057 --> 10:42.967
Bringing up ice. That kind of

10:43.002 --> 10:43.732
shit.

10:43.767 --> 10:44.433
his Chief?

10:44.468 --> 10:45.565
no. Our Chief, Jerry.

10:45.600 --> 10:46.633
what would he be working as a

10:46.668 --> 10:47.699
bar back for?

10:47.734 --> 10:48.366
it's a good goddamn

10:48.401 --> 10:49.234
question. To tell you the truth,

10:49.269 --> 10:50.335
I really don't care. I was

10:50.370 --> 10:51.369
thinking we would go down

10:51.404 --> 10:52.335
there and bust his balls a

10:52.370 --> 10:53.267
little bit tonight. What do

10:53.302 --> 10:53.966
you say?

10:54.001 --> 10:55.267
I don't know about that, man.

10:55.302 --> 10:56.584
I mean, if he is really working

10:56.619 --> 10:57.993
down there, it's obviously based

10:58.028 --> 10:59.414
on him needing money because of

10:59.449 --> 11:00.674
his gambling problem. He'd be

11:00.709 --> 11:01.971
pretty embarrassed about that.

11:02.006 --> 11:03.234
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. There

11:03.269 --> 11:04.032
is that.

11:04.067 --> 11:05.167
hey, did you see lebron

11:05.202 --> 11:06.134
James the other night?

11:06.169 --> 11:07.067
Jesus Christ, he was

11:07.102 --> 11:07.732
unconscious.

11:07.767 --> 11:08.500
isn't it ridiculous?

11:08.535 --> 11:09.232
unbelievable.

11:09.267 --> 11:10.034
the one shot he took, it was

11:10.069 --> 11:11.232
straight up...

11:11.267 --> 11:12.284
hey! You guys enjoying your

11:12.319 --> 11:13.266
little sewing circle here?

11:13.301 --> 11:14.434
There's work to be done. Go help

11:14.469 --> 11:15.567
the guys in the engine take up

11:15.602 --> 11:17.633
the line, assholes!

11:17.668 --> 11:18.384
all right.

11:18.419 --> 11:19.176
sorry, Chief.

11:19.211 --> 11:19.934
it's bullshit.

11:19.969 --> 11:20.801
OK.

11:20.836 --> 11:21.598
God.

11:21.633 --> 11:23.201
you know what? I'll see you

11:23.236 --> 11:24.500
tonight at 9:00.

11:24.535 --> 11:25.251
yeah?

11:25.286 --> 11:27.010
yeah.

11:27.045 --> 11:28.699
right!

11:28.734 --> 11:29.800
I got to put the radio on the

11:29.835 --> 11:30.884
charge.

11:30.919 --> 11:31.899
yeah?

11:31.934 --> 11:34.234
oh, Christ.

11:38.800 --> 11:41.650
hey, Sean.

11:41.685 --> 11:44.465
hello.

11:44.500 --> 11:45.967
been thinking about you.

11:46.002 --> 11:47.399
really? Yeah, I've been

11:47.434 --> 11:48.284
thinking about you, too, and the

11:48.319 --> 11:49.134
9 other guys that you've been

11:49.169 --> 11:50.498
banging behind my back.

11:50.533 --> 11:52.767
can you come and talk to me?

11:52.802 --> 11:55.001
Can you please... please?

11:57.667 --> 12:01.032
What?

12:01.067 --> 12:03.900
I miss you and I realize that

12:03.935 --> 12:04.984
I made some mistakes.

12:05.019 --> 12:05.999
yeah. 9 of them.

12:06.034 --> 12:07.134
would you stop with the 9.

12:07.169 --> 12:08.218
Actually, there was only 4 and

12:08.253 --> 12:09.426
one of those guys I don't even

12:09.461 --> 12:10.897
think I had his name right.

12:10.932 --> 12:12.334
Those bums, they never meant

12:12.369 --> 12:13.399
anything to me.

12:13.434 --> 12:14.884
Maggie, what do you want?

12:14.919 --> 12:17.010
I don't know. I want you and

12:17.045 --> 12:19.689
me to try again. To start over.

12:19.724 --> 12:22.334
No other guys in the mix. I want

12:22.369 --> 12:26.498
you to be my...

12:26.533 --> 12:28.434
Jesus! If I have to actually

12:28.469 --> 12:29.066
say the words,

12:29.101 --> 12:30.234
I think I'm going to puke.

12:30.269 --> 12:33.235
that's classy.

12:33.270 --> 12:36.166
just a second.

12:36.201 --> 12:37.633
I want you to be my boyfriend.

12:37.668 --> 12:39.399
Maggie, you completely

12:39.434 --> 12:41.033
betrayed my trust, OK? How do I

12:41.068 --> 12:42.251
know that I'm not like one of

12:42.286 --> 12:43.526
these other guys? How do I know

12:43.561 --> 12:44.881
that I mean anything to you?

12:44.916 --> 12:46.558
because I know. I didn't

12:46.593 --> 12:47.813
before. I'll admit that. But

12:47.848 --> 12:49.341
then you punched nacho in the

12:49.376 --> 12:50.571
face and everything changed.

12:50.606 --> 12:51.603
yeah. Sorry about that. I

12:51.638 --> 12:52.503
don't know what got into me.

12:52.538 --> 12:53.786
no, no! Don't be sorry. Oh,

12:53.821 --> 12:54.911
my God. It was so goddamn hot.

12:54.946 --> 12:56.023
It took me back to when I was

12:56.058 --> 12:57.046
younger and I used to always

12:57.081 --> 12:58.424
fall for the guys who got into

12:58.459 --> 12:59.979
fights over me. It's like this

13:00.014 --> 13:01.241
incredible aphrodisiac. I'm

13:01.276 --> 13:02.468
getting hot just thinking about

13:02.503 --> 13:03.166
it.

13:03.201 --> 13:04.317
but wait a second. You want

13:04.352 --> 13:05.376
to be with me because what? I

13:05.411 --> 13:06.401
punched some guy in the face?

13:06.436 --> 13:07.266
yes!

13:07.301 --> 13:09.100
yeah. That's crazy, Maggie!

13:09.135 --> 13:10.451
That's insane! You're nuts!

13:10.486 --> 13:11.732
That's not a basis for a

13:11.767 --> 13:13.683
relationship. So what? You would

13:13.718 --> 13:15.109
leave me if I didn't, like, kick

13:15.144 --> 13:16.489
somebody's ass every couple of

13:16.524 --> 13:17.612
days? It's unbelievable. You

13:17.647 --> 13:18.707
know what? I'm glad I found out

13:18.742 --> 13:20.304
about this shit before I got in

13:20.339 --> 13:21.867
too deep. It's unbelievable.

13:27.234 --> 13:28.484
OK. Fine.

13:28.519 --> 13:29.699
yeah?

13:29.734 --> 13:30.767
yeah. I don't know if I love

13:30.802 --> 13:31.800
you or I'm an idiot but either

13:31.835 --> 13:32.832
way it's...

13:32.867 --> 13:34.867
aw. I want this to work out.

13:46.634 --> 13:47.750
yeah?

13:47.785 --> 13:48.742
it's me.

13:48.777 --> 13:49.665
hey!

13:49.700 --> 13:50.432
any reaction to our

13:50.467 --> 13:51.700
performance the other night?

13:51.735 --> 13:52.899
you know what? No. Nothing

13:52.934 --> 13:54.234
from Janet. Nothing from Johnny.

13:54.269 --> 13:55.001
Zilch.

13:55.036 --> 13:55.802
damn it.

13:55.837 --> 13:56.533
I know.

13:56.568 --> 13:58.351
well, anyway, Tommy, I wanted

13:58.386 --> 14:00.134
to tell you that I, um, had a

14:00.169 --> 14:01.301
surprisingly great time

14:01.336 --> 14:02.366
the other night.

14:02.401 --> 14:03.432
Not just the fake stuff,

14:03.467 --> 14:05.200
but that stuff was great, too.

14:05.235 --> 14:06.551
The kissing and everything.

14:06.586 --> 14:07.832
I know. I know. You're a

14:07.867 --> 14:09.550
great kisser. I mean, I wish,

14:09.585 --> 14:11.234
you know, we could just find a

14:11.269 --> 14:14.032
time to have a non-evil,

14:14.067 --> 14:15.734
unsecret, non-revenged base, you

14:15.769 --> 14:17.401
know, dinner or something. You

14:17.436 --> 14:18.132
know?

14:18.167 --> 14:19.433
OK. I would like that.

14:19.468 --> 14:20.665
me, too. But speaking of

14:20.700 --> 14:22.800
secrets and revenge and evil and

14:22.835 --> 14:24.251
stuff, Janet and Johnny are

14:24.286 --> 14:25.633
going to this NYPD event

14:25.668 --> 14:27.250
tomorrow night and I know I can

14:27.285 --> 14:28.833
get tickets. We show up and, you

14:28.868 --> 14:30.166
know, put on a show.

14:30.201 --> 14:31.734
but that could get ugly.

14:31.769 --> 14:33.232
that's what I'm hoping.

14:33.267 --> 14:34.967
OK. Call me when you have the

14:35.002 --> 14:35.865
info.

14:35.900 --> 14:37.599
OK, and you know what? Wear

14:37.634 --> 14:38.501
something that kind of shows off

14:38.536 --> 14:39.366
your rack.

14:39.401 --> 14:40.100
have you been looking at my

14:40.135 --> 14:40.965
rack?

14:41.000 --> 14:42.317
hey! I'm a guy. I mean, till

14:42.352 --> 14:43.909
you move around to the other

14:43.944 --> 14:45.189
side, I'm going to be, you know.

14:45.224 --> 14:46.279
Actually, even if you moved them

14:46.314 --> 14:47.340
around to the other side, I'd

14:47.375 --> 14:48.367
probably just walk behind you a

14:48.402 --> 14:49.399
lot.

14:49.434 --> 14:52.965
what about my ass?

14:53.000 --> 14:55.501
your ass is spectacular.

14:55.536 --> 14:57.085
call me.

14:57.120 --> 14:58.634
bye.

15:01.501 --> 15:04.134
but it's a... it's a blast.

15:11.000 --> 15:12.167
hi.

15:12.202 --> 15:13.299
hey.

15:13.334 --> 15:14.299
any luck?

15:14.334 --> 15:15.384
no. I've been here for about

15:15.419 --> 15:16.434
10 minutes. No sign of him yet.

15:16.469 --> 15:18.232
really? Hmm.

15:18.267 --> 15:19.250
watch your back.

15:19.285 --> 15:22.343
check it out.

15:22.378 --> 15:25.366
excuse me.

15:25.401 --> 15:26.934
Jesus, Jerry! I asked for

15:26.969 --> 15:27.832
lite.

15:27.867 --> 15:29.034
that's not what you said,

15:29.069 --> 15:29.798
sweetheart.

15:29.833 --> 15:31.300
I said lite. This is why I

15:31.335 --> 15:32.767
don't like working with the

15:32.802 --> 15:33.599
elderly.

15:33.634 --> 15:34.800
watch that shit, girlie.

15:34.835 --> 15:35.932
just take this back and get

15:35.967 --> 15:38.668
me the lite... sometime tonight.

15:47.733 --> 15:49.883
hey, dude. Who's the chick?

15:49.918 --> 15:52.034
her name's Paula. She's

15:52.069 --> 15:52.798
sweet.

15:52.833 --> 15:53.950
yeah? You banging her?

15:53.985 --> 15:55.032
I just met her, dude.

15:55.067 --> 15:56.065
but you want to bang her?

15:56.100 --> 15:57.767
Don't deny it, Mike. I'm a guy.

15:57.802 --> 15:59.368
I know all the bullshit moves.

15:59.403 --> 16:00.934
Listen to me, you screw around

16:00.969 --> 16:02.268
behind my back, we're

16:02.303 --> 16:03.418
through. No! I mean it!

16:03.453 --> 16:04.776
well, what about you? What

16:04.811 --> 16:06.372
about the underwear I found

16:06.407 --> 16:07.737
under your bed? I don't wear

16:07.772 --> 16:09.067
that brand. You don't wear that

16:09.102 --> 16:09.732
brand.

16:09.767 --> 16:10.467
that belonged to my

16:10.502 --> 16:11.099
ex-roommate.

16:11.134 --> 16:12.417
you told me your ex-roommate

16:12.452 --> 16:14.226
was fat, Chris. It was size 34

16:14.261 --> 16:16.647
waist and it was a leopard print

16:16.682 --> 16:18.724
micro bikini. Fat guys don't

16:18.759 --> 16:20.767
wear micro bikinis. Nobody wears

16:20.802 --> 16:21.399
those.

16:21.434 --> 16:22.300
hey! Look! If you're going to

16:22.335 --> 16:23.434
accuse me, if you're going to be

16:23.469 --> 16:25.068
an asshole about some strange

16:25.103 --> 16:26.668
underwear you found, don't come

16:26.703 --> 16:27.967
home.

16:30.767 --> 16:31.883
ahh, they raised the rent,

16:31.918 --> 16:33.276
you know, and trying to make a

16:33.311 --> 16:34.389
couple extra bucks. Tried to

16:34.424 --> 16:35.445
find somebody to borrow the

16:35.480 --> 16:36.467
money from but I couldn't. So,

16:36.502 --> 16:37.633
here I am.

16:37.668 --> 16:38.466
yeah. It's nothing to be

16:38.501 --> 16:39.434
ashamed of, Chief. It's what my

16:39.469 --> 16:40.367
dad would do. You know, you're

16:40.402 --> 16:41.232
taking care of your wife.

16:41.267 --> 16:42.850
I wish it would help my self-

16:42.885 --> 16:44.434
esteem. Maybe if I actually saw

16:44.469 --> 16:45.584
some cabbage, you know?

16:45.619 --> 16:46.743
what? He ain't paying you?

16:46.778 --> 16:48.206
nah. The guy that owns this

16:48.241 --> 16:49.421
joint, birdie, every time I

16:49.456 --> 16:50.728
mention it to him, he keeps on

16:50.763 --> 16:52.165
stalling. Whenever I want to get

16:52.200 --> 16:53.800
squared away. I've been here a

16:53.835 --> 16:55.401
month. Got 100 bucks in my

16:55.436 --> 16:56.065
pocket.

16:56.100 --> 16:56.732
Jesus, Chief. Sounds like

16:56.767 --> 16:57.733
you need to look for a new job.

16:57.768 --> 16:58.665
yeah. Soon as I get that

16:58.700 --> 16:59.568
money in my hand, I'm quitting

16:59.603 --> 17:00.533
this job.

17:00.568 --> 17:01.934
Jerry, Cindy needs a case of

17:01.969 --> 17:03.068
lite and some fresh ice, huh?

17:03.103 --> 17:04.166
Chop chop. I ain't paying you to

17:04.202 --> 17:04.832
mingle.

17:04.867 --> 17:05.566
you're not paying me

17:05.601 --> 17:06.901
period, birdie. I'll tell you

17:06.935 --> 17:08.268
what. I'll make you a deal. You

17:08.303 --> 17:09.885
put 400 bucks in my hand, I'll

17:09.920 --> 17:11.376
get Cindy her ice, her beer.

17:11.411 --> 17:12.833
I'll get her a goddamn pony.

17:12.867 --> 17:14.065
get to work, huh?

17:14.099 --> 17:15.201
why don't you pay him what

17:15.236 --> 17:15.932
you owe him?

17:15.967 --> 17:16.733
why don't you screw off?

17:16.768 --> 17:17.432
hey.

17:17.467 --> 17:18.367
Tommy, Tommy. Come on.

17:18.402 --> 17:19.165
Don't bother.

17:19.201 --> 17:21.000
these guys friends of yours?

17:21.035 --> 17:21.833
yeah. They work at my

17:21.867 --> 17:22.698
firehouse.

17:22.733 --> 17:24.383
nice. They just lost you your

17:24.417 --> 17:25.925
job. Get your fat ass out of

17:25.961 --> 17:27.513
here. And tough guy, if you're

17:27.549 --> 17:28.824
thinking about getting grabby,

17:28.859 --> 17:30.113
there's half a dozen gents in

17:30.148 --> 17:31.257
here who love old birdie. Last

17:31.292 --> 17:32.796
guy tried to mix it up with

17:32.831 --> 17:34.382
me, he spends most of his time

17:34.417 --> 17:35.934
now blowing into a little tube.

17:35.969 --> 17:37.868
Get lost.

17:37.903 --> 17:39.202
asshole.

17:39.237 --> 17:40.466
yeah.

17:40.501 --> 17:41.234
come on. Let's get out of

17:41.269 --> 17:41.965
here.

17:42.000 --> 17:42.833
no. We're getting you your

17:42.868 --> 17:43.432
money.

17:43.467 --> 17:44.233
no. Tommy, look. I don't

17:44.268 --> 17:44.965
want any trouble here.

17:45.000 --> 17:45.833
it's no trouble, Chief. This

17:45.868 --> 17:46.566
guy drive a car?

17:46.601 --> 17:48.250
yeah. It's parked out front.

17:48.285 --> 17:49.626
nice. Still got that friend

17:49.661 --> 17:50.967
that rents construction

17:51.002 --> 17:51.698
equipment?

17:51.733 --> 17:52.467
yeah. I like how you're

17:52.502 --> 17:53.234
thinking.

17:53.269 --> 17:55.366
OK.

17:55.401 --> 17:56.851
I'm sorry. It's just been a

17:56.886 --> 17:57.993
while since I've been with a

17:58.028 --> 17:59.100
woman. I guess I'm a little

17:59.135 --> 18:00.199
rusty.

18:00.234 --> 18:01.584
that's OK, Mike.

18:01.619 --> 18:02.934
so you're cool?

18:02.969 --> 18:04.965
yeah.

18:05.000 --> 18:06.933
Paula, listen, you know, I

18:06.968 --> 18:08.867
think you're really hot and

18:08.902 --> 18:09.817
everything.

18:09.852 --> 18:10.698
thanks.

18:10.733 --> 18:11.967
but I also think this could

18:12.002 --> 18:13.434
be more than just a one-night

18:13.469 --> 18:15.651
thing. So, I got to be honest,

18:15.686 --> 18:18.093
which, you know, being a guy,

18:18.128 --> 18:20.031
it's not my usual thing. Before

18:20.066 --> 18:21.934
anything more happens between

18:21.969 --> 18:23.700
us, I have to tell you

18:23.735 --> 18:24.917
something.

18:24.952 --> 18:26.100
you're gay?

18:26.135 --> 18:28.199
no.

18:28.234 --> 18:30.100
Is it that obvious?

18:30.135 --> 18:31.932
so you are gay?

18:31.967 --> 18:33.650
no. I've been living with

18:33.685 --> 18:35.334
this guy for like a month.

18:35.369 --> 18:36.299
the guy at the club?

18:36.334 --> 18:38.200
yeah, and he was a nice guy

18:38.235 --> 18:40.234
and he thought I was this great

18:40.269 --> 18:41.951
guy, so I moved into his place

18:41.986 --> 18:43.526
and long story short, he started

18:43.561 --> 18:45.330
blowing me. And it freaked me

18:45.365 --> 18:46.816
out at first but, you know,

18:46.851 --> 18:48.726
again, being a guy there's no

18:48.761 --> 18:51.280
such thing as a bad blowjob.

18:51.315 --> 18:53.800
Anyway, that's not what I'm

18:53.835 --> 18:54.965
trying to tell you.

18:55.000 --> 18:56.300
Mike, it's OK if you had a

18:56.335 --> 18:58.184
homosexual experience.

18:58.219 --> 18:59.999
no, I didn't. I swear. I

19:00.034 --> 19:01.717
never kissed him or did any of

19:01.752 --> 19:03.401
the stuff he was doing to me. He

19:03.436 --> 19:04.499
was having the homosexual

19:04.534 --> 19:05.650
experience. I just happened to

19:05.685 --> 19:07.459
be in the room at the time.

19:07.494 --> 19:08.814
it's OK. Believe me, Mike.

19:08.849 --> 19:11.525
I've turned a lot of guys

19:11.560 --> 19:14.201
around. I can help you.

19:14.236 --> 19:15.967
you like that?

19:24.800 --> 19:26.668
hey, birdie. Nice night, huh?

19:26.703 --> 19:29.266
piss off.

19:29.301 --> 19:31.533
Where's my car?

19:31.568 --> 19:32.901
I tell you what? You give me

19:32.936 --> 19:34.701
400 bucks and I'll tell you.

19:34.736 --> 19:36.467
you fat prick. I'll give you

19:36.502 --> 19:37.332
5 seconds.

19:37.367 --> 19:38.950
take a look around. You'll

19:38.985 --> 19:40.534
find it. Pleasure working with

19:40.569 --> 19:41.399
you.

19:41.434 --> 19:42.065
you goddamn son of a

19:42.100 --> 19:44.100
bitch. I find one scratch on

19:44.135 --> 19:45.801
that car, I'll track you down.

19:45.836 --> 19:47.651
You and your firefighter pussy

19:47.686 --> 19:49.510
friends. You better tell me

19:49.545 --> 19:51.334
where it is, you prick!

19:56.800 --> 19:58.700
Oh, shit!

20:04.350 --> 20:04.983
you should have

20:05.018 --> 20:05.867
heard him screaming. I hope he

20:05.902 --> 20:06.717
pops an artery, goddamn cheap

20:06.752 --> 20:07.482
bastard.

20:07.517 --> 20:08.282
yeah. Leon got a call

20:08.317 --> 20:09.233
from the cops first thing this

20:09.268 --> 20:10.143
morning, said he'd get the car

20:10.178 --> 20:11.018
down as soon as he could find

20:11.053 --> 20:12.052
the keys to the crane.

20:12.087 --> 20:13.051
it's still there?

20:13.086 --> 20:14.315
oh, yeah.

20:14.350 --> 20:15.783
"vengeance is mine!" sayeth

20:15.818 --> 20:17.217
the 62 truck and the lord, of

20:17.252 --> 20:17.916
course.

20:17.951 --> 20:18.582
yeah. Of course.

20:18.617 --> 20:19.817
hey, Chief, you get any

20:19.852 --> 20:20.851
information from the porno

20:20.886 --> 20:21.851
squad guy about our missing

20:21.886 --> 20:22.515
cash?

20:22.550 --> 20:23.515
yeah. He said his guys

20:23.550 --> 20:24.717
are clean. You know, that flynn,

20:24.752 --> 20:25.884
he's a scum bag but he's not a

20:25.919 --> 20:27.115
thief.

20:27.150 --> 20:28.283
holy, shit. What

20:28.318 --> 20:29.382
happened to you?

20:29.417 --> 20:30.317
well, I was out with your

20:30.352 --> 20:31.282
sister last night.

20:31.317 --> 20:32.150
damn! That was my first

20:32.185 --> 20:32.782
guess.

20:32.817 --> 20:34.083
yeah. Turns out she really

20:34.118 --> 20:35.867
likes it when I get into fights.

20:35.902 --> 20:37.617
Turns her on. So, on the way, I

20:37.652 --> 20:38.801
beat the shit out of this

20:38.836 --> 20:39.810
messenger kid on a bike. But

20:39.845 --> 20:40.784
that wasn't enough. So, I took

20:40.819 --> 20:41.716
on 2 guys outside of her

20:41.751 --> 20:43.284
apartment, which is where I got

20:43.319 --> 20:45.035
this and then she wanted some

20:45.070 --> 20:46.626
coffee but I was tired and, you

20:46.661 --> 20:48.005
know, hemorrhaging, so I took on

20:48.040 --> 20:49.445
some old guy and his little gay

20:49.480 --> 20:50.851
dog, which is how I got this...

20:50.886 --> 20:51.949
ooh!

20:51.984 --> 20:53.016
and this.

20:53.051 --> 20:54.484
gay dogs are the worst.

20:54.519 --> 20:55.649
of course.

20:55.684 --> 20:56.517
well, I'm suppose to go out

20:56.552 --> 20:57.318
with her tonight, you know, I

20:57.353 --> 20:58.285
want to make her happy but I got

20:58.320 --> 20:59.251
to figure out a way to fight

20:59.286 --> 21:00.183
some guys where I'm not going to

21:00.218 --> 21:01.101
get hurt.

21:01.136 --> 21:01.949
just guys?

21:01.984 --> 21:02.984
yeah, just guys for now. I

21:03.019 --> 21:03.935
mean, I'm sure I'll fight some

21:03.970 --> 21:04.851
chicks in a couple weeks but for

21:04.886 --> 21:05.651
now, just guys.

21:05.686 --> 21:06.382
that's understood.

21:06.417 --> 21:07.250
what about guys with one leg?

21:07.285 --> 21:08.334
or no legs.

21:08.369 --> 21:09.349
midgets.

21:09.384 --> 21:10.367
midgets with no legs.

21:10.402 --> 21:11.350
ahh, they're too hard to

21:11.385 --> 21:12.083
find.

21:12.118 --> 21:13.068
personally, I wouldn't mess

21:13.103 --> 21:14.410
with legless midgets. I mean,

21:14.445 --> 21:15.717
they're midgets, then insult to

21:15.752 --> 21:16.751
injury, no legs.

21:16.786 --> 21:17.449
yeah.

21:17.484 --> 21:18.550
I mean, these guys got to be

21:18.585 --> 21:19.182
loaded for bear.

21:19.217 --> 21:20.300
Now, I knew a midget who had no

21:20.335 --> 21:21.276
arms, no legs, half a face and

21:21.311 --> 21:22.217
only like a body went up to

21:22.252 --> 21:23.016
here.

21:23.051 --> 21:23.682
what did they call him?

21:23.717 --> 21:25.284
they called him georgie. Nice

21:25.319 --> 21:26.851
enough guy. Didn't eat much.

21:29.617 --> 21:30.851
hi, sweet stuff.

21:30.886 --> 21:31.682
hey.

21:31.717 --> 21:32.884
oh, I missed you.

21:32.919 --> 21:34.335
I missed you, too.

21:34.370 --> 21:35.716
I have a little early

21:35.751 --> 21:37.517
honeymoon present for you.

21:37.552 --> 21:38.534
oh, yeah?

21:38.569 --> 21:39.482
yeah.

21:39.517 --> 21:41.916
There's this guard. He's

21:41.951 --> 21:44.050
going to slip you a cell phone.

21:44.085 --> 21:45.701
And then I could text you and

21:45.736 --> 21:47.317
send you naked pictures and you

21:47.352 --> 21:48.649
can do the same.

21:48.684 --> 21:50.700
how did you manage that?

21:50.735 --> 21:52.959
money changes everything,

21:52.994 --> 21:54.839
baby. And I had my ex who was

21:54.874 --> 21:56.379
on death row for 5 years, he

21:56.414 --> 21:58.532
learned how to bend the rules a

21:58.567 --> 22:00.651
little bit. So, any requests

22:00.686 --> 22:02.282
photo-wise?

22:02.317 --> 22:04.684
oh, you rotten, dirty, little

22:04.719 --> 22:05.549
whore.

22:05.584 --> 22:07.084
correction... I'm your dirty,

22:07.119 --> 22:08.485
little whore.

22:08.520 --> 22:09.769
yeah, daddy.

22:09.804 --> 22:11.018
yeah, daddy.

22:13.283 --> 22:14.150
hey!

22:14.185 --> 22:14.983
hey!

22:15.018 --> 22:17.584
oh, my God. You look amazing.

22:17.619 --> 22:20.782
thank you.

22:20.817 --> 22:22.784
ready to reek havoc?

22:22.819 --> 22:23.649
I am.

22:23.684 --> 22:25.084
I feel it in my bones. Did

22:25.119 --> 22:26.484
you find someone to watch the

22:26.519 --> 22:27.182
girls?

22:27.217 --> 22:30.450
yeah. We're all set.

22:30.485 --> 22:34.201
OK.

22:34.236 --> 22:37.882
Wow!

22:37.917 --> 22:40.484
OK. Here we go.

22:56.584 --> 22:58.051
see? This is fun. Dinner and

22:58.086 --> 22:59.168
a movie with uncle Lou.

22:59.203 --> 23:00.250
hey, harry. They're here.

23:01.417 --> 23:03.183
oh, my God. Don't look. Don't

23:03.218 --> 23:03.917
look.

23:04.984 --> 23:06.182
I want to see.

23:06.217 --> 23:07.582
it's just so disgusting. I

23:07.617 --> 23:08.584
told you. We should have gone to

23:08.619 --> 23:09.782
the pixar movie.

23:09.817 --> 23:11.617
oh, this is fine. Listen, as

23:11.652 --> 23:12.917
soon as this guy stops sawing

23:12.952 --> 23:14.651
through that little girl's

23:14.686 --> 23:16.350
skull, you can watch it.

23:20.217 --> 23:22.150
the citizens alliance would

23:22.185 --> 23:24.018
like to thank captain bernard

23:24.053 --> 23:25.852
for his tireless efforts in

23:25.887 --> 23:27.602
keeping our neighborhood safe.

23:27.637 --> 23:29.317
You truly are among the best the

23:29.352 --> 23:31.751
NYPD has to offer. Captain

23:31.786 --> 23:33.283
bernard.

23:37.617 --> 23:39.300
thank you, frank. I've been

23:39.335 --> 23:40.909
living in this neighborhood my

23:40.944 --> 23:42.449
whole life and I have been

23:42.484 --> 23:43.584
controlling the streets for over

23:43.619 --> 23:44.582
15 years.

23:44.617 --> 23:45.984
I'd like to thank my friends

23:46.019 --> 23:47.315
and my family.

23:47.350 --> 23:48.248
let's go over here.

23:48.283 --> 23:49.150
no, no, no, no, no. Let's

23:49.185 --> 23:51.234
just sit down.

23:51.269 --> 23:53.283
oh, my God.

24:00.584 --> 24:02.517
that prick.

24:15.784 --> 24:16.949
you're an idiot. You know

24:16.984 --> 24:19.133
that, Tommy? I've been feeling

24:19.168 --> 24:20.609
bad. I've been feeling guilty.

24:20.644 --> 24:21.730
You know, getting ready to

24:21.765 --> 24:22.641
make a phone call. Trying to

24:22.676 --> 24:23.979
reach out and make things

24:24.014 --> 24:25.232
right and you go pull a

24:25.267 --> 24:26.450
stupid, obvious stunt like

24:26.485 --> 24:29.749
this?

24:29.784 --> 24:31.951
Not in a million years

24:31.986 --> 24:33.685
are you sleeping with her.

24:33.720 --> 24:35.352
That's got to be tough. Huh,

24:35.387 --> 24:37.119
Tommy? Knowing I'm banging your

24:37.154 --> 24:38.851
ex. Knowing you're never going

24:38.886 --> 24:39.951
to get mine.

24:42.851 --> 24:46.984
ahh! God! Man, you're an

24:47.019 --> 24:47.782
asshole.

24:47.817 --> 24:52.384
yeah. Well, at least I'm dry.

24:52.419 --> 24:55.118
you're pathetic.

24:55.153 --> 24:57.782
long time, no see.

24:57.817 --> 25:01.217
yeah. This is a surprise. So

25:01.252 --> 25:02.401
you know somebody here?

25:02.436 --> 25:03.543
oh, I have a bunch of cop

25:03.578 --> 25:05.348
friends back from when Johnny

25:05.383 --> 25:07.017
and I were married. I heard

25:07.052 --> 25:08.651
about the two of you. You've

25:08.686 --> 25:09.934
been a busy girl.

25:09.969 --> 25:11.148
no busier than you.

25:11.183 --> 25:12.933
oh, you mean me and Tommy?

25:12.968 --> 25:14.684
That's such a big surprise

25:14.719 --> 25:15.282
to me.

25:15.317 --> 25:16.484
You know, he was never really my

25:16.519 --> 25:17.651
type and them I bumped into him

25:17.686 --> 25:18.449
a couple of...

25:18.484 --> 25:19.283
did you actually think that I

25:19.318 --> 25:20.300
believe this bullshit?

25:20.335 --> 25:21.292
oh, why? I'm not good

25:21.327 --> 25:22.215
enough for Tommy?

25:22.250 --> 25:23.800
no. That is not it, angie.

25:23.835 --> 25:25.350
oh, yeah. I think it is.

25:25.385 --> 25:29.051
well, it's not.

25:29.086 --> 25:32.682
Look. We were

25:32.717 --> 25:34.817
never close and frankly, I never

25:34.852 --> 25:35.901
liked you.

25:35.936 --> 25:36.916
really?

25:36.951 --> 25:39.084
yeah. But then you did one

25:39.119 --> 25:41.501
thing that I could never do.

25:41.536 --> 25:43.176
You broke free. You got away

25:43.211 --> 25:44.797
from the neighborhood and all

25:44.832 --> 25:46.208
the petty family bullshit. You

25:46.243 --> 25:47.746
broke away and you started a

25:47.781 --> 25:49.149
whole new life for yourself and

25:49.184 --> 25:50.482
I respected you for that so

25:50.517 --> 25:53.500
much. But now, here you are, all

25:53.535 --> 25:56.442
dressed up dead center in a pile

25:56.477 --> 25:58.714
of shit. Welcome home, angie.

25:58.749 --> 26:00.916
no, no. I already got my

26:00.951 --> 26:02.301
welcome home when I made it with

26:02.336 --> 26:03.593
your husband. Don't worry about

26:03.628 --> 26:04.689
those frown lines, sweetie.

26:04.724 --> 26:07.421
Just keep smiling. No one's

26:07.456 --> 26:10.118
going to notice. Aw, you kids

26:10.153 --> 26:11.517
have a great night.

26:15.484 --> 26:17.282
God damn it.

26:17.317 --> 26:20.833
well, you were right. I mean,

26:20.868 --> 26:23.092
we could have done a little bit

26:23.127 --> 26:25.272
bigger show but after you piss

26:25.307 --> 26:27.079
on a guy, you really have no

26:27.114 --> 26:28.851
place else to go. You know what

26:28.886 --> 26:30.018
I mean?

26:31.851 --> 26:32.682
God damn it.

26:32.717 --> 26:36.083
you all right? What's wrong?

26:36.118 --> 26:39.450
what the hell am I doing?

26:39.485 --> 26:41.115
what do you mean?

26:41.150 --> 26:43.917
I mean, I'm just as bad as

26:43.952 --> 26:46.768
the rest of you.

26:46.803 --> 26:49.584
you're great. OK?

26:49.619 --> 26:52.018
I'm serious.

26:52.053 --> 26:54.382
All right.

26:54.417 --> 26:56.067
Listen to me. You know there are

26:56.102 --> 26:58.060
certain moments in time that

26:58.095 --> 27:00.018
you, you always, sort of, you

27:00.053 --> 27:01.248
know, keep track of in

27:01.283 --> 27:04.550
your head and I remember it was

27:04.585 --> 27:07.467
Connor's christening. All right?

27:07.502 --> 27:10.326
And we had that barbeque and

27:10.361 --> 27:13.706
that party in the yard and it

27:13.741 --> 27:16.529
was either Connor or katy. I

27:16.564 --> 27:19.157
can't remember. But anyways, you

27:19.192 --> 27:22.021
were talking to my mother and

27:22.056 --> 27:24.851
you had that blue kind of fluffy

27:24.886 --> 27:27.885
sweater on and...

27:27.920 --> 27:30.849
it caught my eye...

27:30.884 --> 27:33.334
and... l... I was watching you

27:33.369 --> 27:36.193
talking to her and I'm telling

27:36.228 --> 27:39.018
you. It... it took my breath

27:39.053 --> 27:41.668
away.

27:41.703 --> 27:44.283
Yeah.

27:48.051 --> 27:49.751
I'm serious.

28:14.851 --> 28:18.434
this is incredibly stupid.

28:18.469 --> 28:21.326
well, you're in luck because

28:21.361 --> 28:24.183
incredibly stupid is one of my

28:24.218 --> 28:26.150
best things.

28:34.500 --> 28:36.267
you girls aren't eating.

28:36.302 --> 28:37.999
this food is hideous.

28:38.034 --> 28:38.967
I thought you were going to take

28:39.002 --> 28:39.799
us somewhere nice.

28:39.834 --> 28:41.067
what are you talking about?

28:41.102 --> 28:42.801
This place has got the best

28:42.836 --> 28:44.251
steam table in the city. This

28:44.286 --> 28:45.677
cabbage. I mean, you don't find

28:45.712 --> 28:46.873
cabbage like that anywhere else.

28:46.908 --> 28:48.704
That's a culinary masterpiece

28:48.739 --> 28:50.500
right there. We'll just get that

28:50.535 --> 28:53.099
off.

28:53.134 --> 28:54.850
can't we go home?

28:54.885 --> 28:56.532
what's your rush?

28:56.567 --> 28:58.901
it's 10:30. I still have some

28:58.936 --> 29:00.966
homework to do.

29:01.001 --> 29:02.300
all right. Let me just finish

29:02.335 --> 29:03.600
my beer, OK? They don't grow on

29:03.635 --> 29:05.599
trees.

29:05.634 --> 29:07.500
Oh, I wish they did.

29:13.134 --> 29:15.367
How are you girls on cash?

29:17.500 --> 29:18.500
Tommy, Tommy, Tommy, Tommy,

29:18.535 --> 29:20.867
Tommy. Tommy.

29:20.902 --> 29:23.165
I always knew

29:23.200 --> 29:24.600
you'd be good at that...

29:24.635 --> 29:26.701
and I was right.

29:26.736 --> 29:30.799
oh, yeah.

29:30.834 --> 29:34.484
So, anyway, better than he

29:34.519 --> 29:38.143
whose name we dare not speak?

29:38.178 --> 29:41.732
Johnny! Let's not

29:41.767 --> 29:43.134
go there. You guys have enough

29:43.169 --> 29:45.365
problems.

29:45.400 --> 29:47.017
You're still hard?

29:47.052 --> 29:48.709
I am a little.

29:48.744 --> 29:50.589
that's a little?

29:50.624 --> 29:52.399
well, a lot.

29:52.434 --> 29:54.634
oh, did you take something?

29:54.669 --> 29:57.434
no. It's just you.

29:57.469 --> 30:00.200
It's all natural.

30:00.235 --> 30:01.284
yeah?

30:01.319 --> 30:02.298
mm-hmm.

30:02.333 --> 30:03.767
you want to go again?

30:03.802 --> 30:05.365
yeah.

30:05.400 --> 30:09.950
OK. But is this honest to God

30:09.985 --> 30:12.826
years of sexual tension I can't

30:12.861 --> 30:15.667
wait to get my hands on angie's

30:15.702 --> 30:16.600
body.

30:17.767 --> 30:19.133
that day is finally

30:19.168 --> 30:21.834
here hard-on or secret evil

30:21.869 --> 30:24.500
revenge on my brother and

30:24.535 --> 30:25.867
his ex-wife one?

30:25.902 --> 30:26.768
um...

30:26.803 --> 30:27.618
hmm?

30:27.653 --> 30:28.399
ooh.

30:28.434 --> 30:31.117
It can be both. It can be both.

30:31.152 --> 30:33.801
OK. It's probably 80% honest

30:33.836 --> 30:35.666
and 20% evil.

30:35.701 --> 30:38.766
go honest. Go evil.

30:38.801 --> 30:41.165
she's not his type. Shit.

30:41.200 --> 30:44.117
That slut wasn't even my type.

30:44.152 --> 30:46.242
You were but, you know, then

30:46.277 --> 30:48.539
chuckles went ahead and got you

30:48.574 --> 30:50.804
to marry him and I had to settle

30:50.839 --> 30:53.034
for second best, you know. I

30:53.069 --> 30:55.134
mean, come on...

30:55.169 --> 30:56.535
besides which,

30:56.570 --> 30:57.866
why do you care?

30:57.901 --> 30:59.250
I don't know. I just do.

30:59.285 --> 31:00.559
look, you know what?

31:00.594 --> 31:01.799
Forget about her.

31:01.834 --> 31:03.417
Forget about the whole thing.

31:03.452 --> 31:05.001
Right now, all that matters is

31:05.036 --> 31:09.233
us. Huh? All right?

31:09.268 --> 31:11.934
all right.

31:11.969 --> 31:13.799
Us.

31:13.834 --> 31:15.567
You and me.

31:19.200 --> 31:21.565
oh, that's so

31:21.600 --> 31:22.599
officially the longest

31:22.634 --> 31:24.134
lasting hard-on in the history

31:24.169 --> 31:25.684
of hard-ons there.

31:25.719 --> 31:27.165
yeah. Actually,

31:27.200 --> 31:28.365
I had one when I was 14

31:28.400 --> 31:29.800
and it pretty much lasted all

31:29.835 --> 31:31.200
the way through freshman year.

31:31.235 --> 31:32.198
So...

31:32.233 --> 31:34.632
OK. That's interesting,

31:34.667 --> 31:39.500
but I just... I have to scoot.

31:39.535 --> 31:41.999
Do you want me to...

31:42.034 --> 31:43.683
no. That's... it will probably

31:43.718 --> 31:45.926
go away by the time I drop you

31:45.961 --> 31:48.134
off. So... give me a couple of

31:48.169 --> 31:49.133
secs here.

31:49.168 --> 31:51.250
oh, are you all right?

31:51.285 --> 31:53.333
yep. Good. Hey! Quarter.

31:53.368 --> 31:54.332
Uhh!

31:54.367 --> 31:55.667
Be right with you.

32:01.534 --> 32:02.699
here.

32:02.734 --> 32:04.033
oh, great.

32:04.068 --> 32:05.501
tell ellie I said thank you

32:05.536 --> 32:06.934
for the bottle of miltons. It's

32:06.969 --> 32:08.966
very nice.

32:09.001 --> 32:10.467
It already went off once.

32:10.502 --> 32:12.666
oh! Left tit.

32:12.701 --> 32:13.834
it's nice. You know why she's

32:13.869 --> 32:15.033
marrying you, right?

32:15.068 --> 32:16.684
because I'm a big, strong,

32:16.719 --> 32:18.026
attractive, almost thin guy

32:18.061 --> 32:19.333
who's not afraid to express

32:19.368 --> 32:20.799
himself justice-wise?

32:20.834 --> 32:22.001
no. Because you're trapped in

32:22.036 --> 32:23.835
here and she knows you're not

32:23.870 --> 32:25.302
going to cheat on her unless

32:25.337 --> 32:26.885
you're some kind of a fag or

32:26.920 --> 32:28.160
something or, you know, some

32:28.195 --> 32:30.131
wimpy guy who's going to get

32:30.166 --> 32:31.749
bum-rushed by another lifer. No.

32:31.784 --> 32:33.625
She knows where you are all the

32:33.660 --> 32:35.496
time. You're like her little

32:35.531 --> 32:37.333
dog that she keeps in a cage.

32:37.368 --> 32:39.499
right tit.

32:39.534 --> 32:41.084
very nice. Look, enjoy the

32:41.119 --> 32:42.376
ride. OK? I'm just saying that

32:42.411 --> 32:43.639
any guy that I ever knew that

32:43.674 --> 32:44.832
got married in the joint,

32:44.867 --> 32:45.934
everything went great when they

32:45.969 --> 32:47.068
were in here. As soon as they

32:47.103 --> 32:48.085
got on the outside, it was a

32:48.120 --> 32:49.443
horror show. "where are you

32:49.478 --> 32:50.767
going? What time will you be

32:50.802 --> 32:51.866
home?"

32:51.901 --> 32:53.033
yeah, well, I don't

32:53.068 --> 32:54.834
have to worry about that. I

32:54.869 --> 32:56.351
killed a guy, for Christ sakes.

32:56.386 --> 32:57.859
Shot him dead right in front of

32:57.894 --> 32:59.897
200 people in a goddamn bus

32:59.932 --> 33:01.901
station. I'm golden. Wow!

33:01.936 --> 33:02.732
money shot?

33:02.767 --> 33:04.267
get out of here. This one's

33:04.302 --> 33:05.632
private, you pervert.

33:05.667 --> 33:08.200
OK. Whatever you say there,

33:08.235 --> 33:09.732
oj.

33:09.767 --> 33:11.134
whoa, whoa. What do you mean

33:11.169 --> 33:12.033
by that?

33:12.068 --> 33:13.001
well, you could be guilty. No

33:13.036 --> 33:13.934
guarantee you're going to stay

33:13.969 --> 33:14.901
behind bars.

33:14.936 --> 33:16.066
what?

33:16.101 --> 33:17.884
we got 300 mothers against

33:17.919 --> 33:19.293
drunk drivers standing,

33:19.328 --> 33:20.547
protesting in front of the

33:20.582 --> 33:21.732
prison entrance holding up

33:21.767 --> 33:23.367
placards with your name on 'em.

33:23.402 --> 33:24.901
News vans are all out there,

33:24.936 --> 33:26.568
too, saying that you're the

33:26.603 --> 33:29.018
next coming of charles bronson.

33:29.053 --> 33:31.410
shit. God damn it! And just

33:31.445 --> 33:34.289
when things were going so good.

33:34.324 --> 33:37.162
Wait, wait, wait. She wants me

33:37.197 --> 33:39.282
to take a picture of my cock.

33:39.317 --> 33:41.367
Can you give me a few minutes

33:41.402 --> 33:42.565
alone in the shitter?

33:42.600 --> 33:44.350
OK, but you tell her next

33:44.385 --> 33:46.101
time, I want some cubans to

33:46.136 --> 33:48.268
boot.

33:48.303 --> 33:50.365
done.

33:50.400 --> 33:52.250
asshole, what's wrong with

33:52.285 --> 33:53.759
you? All the times you went to

33:53.794 --> 33:55.614
the beach and she was wearing a

33:55.649 --> 33:57.175
bikini. I come home and you go

33:57.210 --> 33:58.701
off in like 5 seconds and you do

33:58.736 --> 34:00.834
this to me? Son of a bitch.

34:01.867 --> 34:02.750
Tommy?

34:02.785 --> 34:03.599
yeah?

34:03.634 --> 34:05.066
who are you talking to?

34:05.101 --> 34:08.300
just thinking out loud, you

34:08.335 --> 34:09.099
know.

34:09.134 --> 34:10.165
are you OK?

34:10.199 --> 34:11.931
yeah. Yeah. Good.

34:11.967 --> 34:15.600
OK. 'cause I really want to

34:15.635 --> 34:16.668
go.

34:16.703 --> 34:17.701
OK.

34:22.534 --> 34:24.434
you've been awfully quiet,

34:24.469 --> 34:25.232
Sean.

34:25.266 --> 34:26.667
really? Wow! I thought I

34:26.702 --> 34:27.532
talked a lot.

34:27.567 --> 34:29.033
no. I'm not talking about

34:29.068 --> 34:30.400
talking. I mean on the getting

34:30.435 --> 34:31.831
me all excited front.

34:31.867 --> 34:33.300
oh. Yeah. Listen, I wanted to

34:33.335 --> 34:34.583
talk to you about that. How

34:34.619 --> 34:35.799
about we go back to your

34:35.833 --> 34:37.699
apartment and I, like, get you

34:37.735 --> 34:39.083
excited in another way, you

34:39.119 --> 34:40.525
know? In a way that doesn't

34:40.561 --> 34:41.934
involve me getting punched in

34:41.969 --> 34:42.634
the kidneys.

34:42.668 --> 34:43.297
huh!

34:43.333 --> 34:43.966
excuse me.

34:44.001 --> 34:44.800
how's that sound?

34:44.835 --> 34:45.600
did you hear that?

34:45.635 --> 34:46.264
what?

34:46.300 --> 34:47.034
that guy just called me a

34:47.069 --> 34:47.632
whore.

34:47.667 --> 34:48.599
no. I missed that.

34:48.634 --> 34:50.250
no. You just called me a

34:50.284 --> 34:51.867
whore, didn't you, asshole?

34:51.902 --> 34:52.565
excuse me?

34:52.600 --> 34:53.600
oh, it was me. I called her a

34:53.635 --> 34:54.600
whore. I sometimes, I just do

34:54.635 --> 34:55.565
that. It's not...

34:55.600 --> 34:56.783
you got a problem, asshole?

34:56.818 --> 34:57.759
God! With you? Come on. No.

34:57.794 --> 34:58.701
What? Are you crazy? This guy

34:58.736 --> 34:59.332
maybe.

34:59.367 --> 35:00.933
no. Definitely him. Not him.

35:00.968 --> 35:02.117
yeah. You're wrong. I think

35:02.152 --> 35:03.226
it was this guy. Did you just

35:03.261 --> 35:04.300
call my lady friend a whore?

35:04.335 --> 35:05.432
get away from me.

35:05.467 --> 35:06.133
you know what? I think you

35:06.168 --> 35:07.300
did. What are you? A tough guy?

35:07.335 --> 35:09.884
Oh! Jesus Christ! Oh!

35:09.919 --> 35:12.434
who's the tough guy now?

35:12.469 --> 35:13.351
Jesus, Sean.

35:13.386 --> 35:14.198
my eyes!

35:14.233 --> 35:15.167
Sean, you need to get up.

35:15.202 --> 35:16.234
This is so embarrassing. You

35:16.269 --> 35:17.451
think you'd never been sprayed

35:17.486 --> 35:18.634
in the eyes with mace before.

35:18.669 --> 35:19.766
my eyes!

35:19.801 --> 35:21.001
Jesus Christ, man. You see

35:21.036 --> 35:21.918
this shit?

35:21.953 --> 35:22.766
what is it?

35:22.801 --> 35:23.817
it's a letter from the new

35:23.852 --> 35:24.834
York chapter of the American

35:24.869 --> 35:25.968
cancer society.

35:26.003 --> 35:27.033
oh, Jesus!

35:27.068 --> 35:28.367
"dear Chief ronald perolli,

35:28.402 --> 35:29.735
the new York chapter of the

35:29.770 --> 35:31.018
American cancer society wishes

35:31.053 --> 35:32.267
to thank you most graciously..."

35:32.302 --> 35:33.501
ow! Son of a bitch!

35:33.536 --> 35:34.666
"accepts your generous

35:34.701 --> 35:36.334
donation of $1,850. you and your

35:36.369 --> 35:37.967
crew will be pleased to know..."

35:38.002 --> 35:39.198
blah blah blah.

35:39.233 --> 35:41.068
see. No smoking kitty. I told

35:41.103 --> 35:42.499
you it was 1,850.

35:42.534 --> 35:43.500
yeah. Perolli stole the money

35:43.535 --> 35:44.467
and donated it to the cancer

35:44.502 --> 35:45.198
people.

35:45.233 --> 35:47.633
this sucks. Totally sucks.

35:47.668 --> 35:49.467
Jesus Christ, man. You OK?

35:49.502 --> 35:51.267
What is this? A ray charles

35:51.302 --> 35:52.332
tribute?

35:52.367 --> 35:56.300
ah! God damn it.

35:56.335 --> 35:57.966
you good?

35:58.001 --> 35:58.899
yeah. I'm good.

35:58.934 --> 35:59.767
yeah, yeah. You're real good.

35:59.802 --> 36:00.600
You need to go home, man, and

36:00.635 --> 36:01.232
get a seeing-eye dog.

36:01.267 --> 36:03.317
I know. It's just my eyes are

36:03.352 --> 36:05.093
killing me. It's unbelievable.

36:05.128 --> 36:06.564
Jesus Christ, Garrity, what

36:06.599 --> 36:08.001
the hell's the matter with you?

36:08.036 --> 36:09.565
I can't see.

36:09.600 --> 36:11.733
look! Perolli took the money

36:11.768 --> 36:13.867
and donated it to the goddamn

36:13.902 --> 36:14.766
cancer people.

36:14.801 --> 36:16.067
the people for it or against

36:16.102 --> 36:17.418
it? I only ask 'cause he's such

36:17.453 --> 36:18.734
a prick, it could go either way.

36:18.769 --> 36:20.133
1,850 bucks gone.

36:20.168 --> 36:21.118
yeah, and like that specific

36:21.153 --> 36:22.460
amount was going to get them

36:22.495 --> 36:23.767
over the hump to finding a cure.

36:23.802 --> 36:25.168
well, easy come, easy go,

36:25.203 --> 36:25.867
guys.

36:26.667 --> 36:28.265
ow! I'm OK.

36:28.300 --> 36:29.417
I'm going to go take care of

36:29.452 --> 36:30.534
stevie wonder over here. All

36:30.569 --> 36:31.198

36:31.233 --> 36:32.365
yeah. Please do.

36:32.400 --> 36:35.267
hey, frank. I say we go back

36:35.302 --> 36:36.551
and get our money.

36:36.586 --> 36:37.766
you think, Mike?

36:37.801 --> 36:39.367
hey, it's not like they can

36:39.402 --> 36:40.934
stop us. They all got cancer.

36:40.969 --> 36:42.467
ow!

36:47.333 --> 36:49.167
hi!

36:49.202 --> 36:50.966
hey!

36:51.001 --> 36:53.334
how was your day?

36:53.369 --> 36:55.035
it was good.

36:55.070 --> 36:56.666
What's going on?

36:56.701 --> 36:58.050
we got pot roast, and your

36:58.085 --> 36:59.292
favorite, sauteed peppers, and

36:59.327 --> 37:00.547
creamy mashed potatoes. It's

37:00.582 --> 37:01.767
going to be ready in about 5

37:01.802 --> 37:03.034
minutes.

37:03.069 --> 37:05.051
yeah?

37:05.086 --> 37:06.999
Uh, why?

37:07.034 --> 37:08.832
'cause I felt like it.

37:08.867 --> 37:11.150
uh-huh. Where's my old man?

37:11.185 --> 37:12.993
oh, I sent him off with Lou.

37:13.028 --> 37:14.548
They went to uncle red's place.

37:14.583 --> 37:16.033
And I told them not to come

37:16.068 --> 37:18.184
back until after 11:00 so we can

37:18.219 --> 37:20.309
eat in peace and enjoy and get

37:20.344 --> 37:22.400
reacquainted. How's angie?

37:22.435 --> 37:24.734
Johnny's angie?

37:24.769 --> 37:26.499
mm-hmm.

37:26.534 --> 37:30.068
I don't know. Why? How would

37:30.103 --> 37:30.966
I know?

37:31.001 --> 37:32.399
I will dump this on the

37:32.434 --> 37:33.934
floor, put the pot roast in the

37:33.969 --> 37:35.632
toilet, and piss in this

37:35.667 --> 37:38.834
saucepan in exactly 5 seconds.

37:38.869 --> 37:41.951
I ran into her last week. I

37:41.986 --> 37:45.034
was going to a union thing. A

37:45.069 --> 37:46.134
surprise union...

37:46.169 --> 37:47.165
speed it up.

37:47.200 --> 37:48.383
and I was on the east side

37:48.418 --> 37:50.342
and just ran into her. Bumped

37:50.377 --> 37:51.922
into her. You know, blah blah

37:51.957 --> 37:53.595
blah. What's going on with you?

37:53.630 --> 37:55.899
Bing bang boom, you know. Why?

37:55.934 --> 37:57.633
oh! That's it? You guys just

37:57.668 --> 37:59.333
happened to bump into each other

37:59.368 --> 38:00.099
on the street?

38:00.134 --> 38:01.734
that happens! People bump

38:01.769 --> 38:02.801
into each other.

38:06.500 --> 38:08.250
OK. Dinner's almost ready.

38:08.285 --> 38:10.001
So, why don't you just go wash

38:10.036 --> 38:11.099
up. I will make you a

38:11.134 --> 38:13.300
cranberry and seltzer. Go on.

38:13.335 --> 38:14.367
Pfft. Pfft.

38:40.333 --> 38:42.233
this is for you.

38:42.268 --> 38:44.134
It's your favorite.

38:44.169 --> 38:45.333
thanks.

38:49.134 --> 38:51.001
Ahh!

38:59.934 --> 39:03.617
I mean, I understand the need

39:03.652 --> 39:07.726
for revenge. I understand envy

39:07.761 --> 39:11.030
and petty jealousy but why

39:11.065 --> 39:13.083
would she want to hurt me? I

39:13.118 --> 39:15.159
mean, all I've ever done is

39:15.194 --> 39:17.200
try to be a really good friend

39:17.235 --> 39:19.432
to her.

39:19.467 --> 39:21.666
It's really sad. I got

39:21.701 --> 39:22.967
to tell you, you know, she lives

39:23.002 --> 39:24.934
in Manhattan and she's got this

39:24.969 --> 39:26.867
big fancy job and this fabulous

39:26.902 --> 39:29.600
apartment.

39:29.635 --> 39:31.534
Hmm.

39:45.101 --> 39:47.867
grr! Aah!

39:47.902 --> 39:49.734
Ahh!

40:37.801 --> 40:39.134
Why can't it just always be

40:39.169 --> 40:42.832
like this?

40:42.867 --> 40:49.165
It's all I want.

40:49.200 --> 40:54.400
Oh, God, Jimmy was just

40:54.435 --> 40:59.600
the love of my life.

40:59.635 --> 41:01.565
When I was 12,

41:01.600 --> 41:02.534
that's when I met the two of

41:02.569 --> 41:05.751
you. I was 12.

41:05.786 --> 41:08.899
I just knew

41:08.934 --> 41:12.051
that he was the one.

41:12.086 --> 41:15.168
He was so beautiful...

41:15.203 --> 41:19.699
and I got him.

41:19.734 --> 41:22.034
It took me till sophomore year

41:22.069 --> 41:24.068
but I got him.

41:38.934 --> 41:41.068
oh, God damn it, I miss him

41:41.103 --> 41:44.465
so much.

41:44.500 --> 41:45.701
I just want Jimmy.

41:45.736 --> 41:46.766
I want Jimmy.

41:46.801 --> 41:48.267
I want Jimmy back. I want

41:48.302 --> 41:49.068
Jimmy back!

41:58.300 --> 42:00.734
Oh! I'm so sorry.

42:00.769 --> 42:03.084
Oh.

42:03.119 --> 42:05.365
Ohh.

42:05.400 --> 42:06.667
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

42:06.702 --> 42:08.467
I'm sorry.

42:08.502 --> 42:10.233
Oh, shit!

43:13.767 --> 43:18.434
t? Tommy? T?

43:18.469 --> 43:23.066
You all right?

43:23.101 --> 43:24.734
What the hell happened?

43:24.769 --> 43:27.298
ahh.

43:27.333 --> 43:28.899
Holy shit!

43:28.934 --> 43:33.966
yeah, yeah. Look familiar?

43:34.001 --> 43:37.084
I hate to say it but, young man,

43:37.119 --> 43:39.593
you're grounded for a week. Oh!

43:39.628 --> 43:42.068
Nice cock. All right. 2 weeks.

43:52.500 --> 43:53.700
listen, don't beat yourself

43:53.735 --> 43:55.134
up, all right? It happens to

43:55.169 --> 43:56.968
a lot of people in the program.

43:57.003 --> 43:58.385
You know, you're doing good.

43:58.420 --> 43:59.543
You're on the straight and

43:59.578 --> 44:00.632
narrow. You're making vast

44:00.667 --> 44:02.184
improvements. You know, vast for

44:02.219 --> 44:03.701
you meaning you're only thinking

44:03.736 --> 44:05.232
about drinking 23 out of 24

44:05.267 --> 44:07.767
hours a day. And then, you know,

44:07.802 --> 44:08.365
what happens, though?

44:08.400 --> 44:09.667
Bottle comes along like an old

44:09.702 --> 44:10.934
friend. You thought it was dead.

44:10.969 --> 44:12.701
It turns out it's alive. It

44:12.736 --> 44:14.385
turns out to be a goddamn

44:14.420 --> 44:15.860
pretty pleasurable reunion.

44:15.895 --> 44:17.614
I know, but I'm telling you I

44:17.649 --> 44:19.241
don't remember a single thing

44:19.276 --> 44:20.672
about that night. Not a thing.

44:20.707 --> 44:22.237
that's tough. I mean, the

44:22.272 --> 44:23.469
only good thing about falling

44:23.504 --> 44:24.502
off the wagon is the beautiful

44:24.537 --> 44:25.918
memories that you have to tide

44:25.953 --> 44:27.327
you over until the next time.

44:27.362 --> 44:28.981
Tom, you made a mistake. You

44:29.016 --> 44:30.600
know, it's going to be OK. Let's

44:30.635 --> 44:32.267
grab a seat.

44:32.302 --> 44:35.265
OK.

44:35.300 --> 44:36.816
Let me ask you something.

44:36.851 --> 44:38.333
Did you ever hear about

44:38.368 --> 44:39.967
survivor's guilt?

44:40.002 --> 44:40.932
yeah. Sure.

44:40.967 --> 44:42.034
'cause somebody mentioned it

44:42.069 --> 44:43.184
to me and it was the first time

44:43.219 --> 44:44.300
I felt like, yeah, maybe this is

44:44.335 --> 44:46.133
what's going on. Maybe

44:46.168 --> 44:47.300
that's what making me, you know,

44:47.335 --> 44:48.051
drink.

44:48.086 --> 44:48.760
no. No.

44:48.795 --> 44:49.399
no?

44:49.434 --> 44:50.232
booze is your problem.

44:50.267 --> 44:51.267
Survivor's guilt. That shit's

44:51.302 --> 44:52.101
easy to get over.

44:52.136 --> 44:53.485
oh.

44:53.520 --> 44:54.834
die.
