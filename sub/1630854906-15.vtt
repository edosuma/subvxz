that died

serious health conditions,

04:27.768 --> 04:29.848

was over 70.

I assure you.

their patients’ suffering,

"intervention."

why he’s getting
a million dollars

09:17.265 --> 09:18.885
when we have
settlement documents

09:18.933 --> 09:23.563
from Kemp Shipping here
agreeing to $3 1/2 million.

09:23.605 --> 09:25.405
See?

09:25.440 --> 09:28.150
That’s the agreement
from Kemp Shipping.

09:28.193 --> 09:30.403
And that’s the one
that Clive gave us.

09:30.445 --> 09:34.915
They’re identical,
except for the figure.

09:34.949 --> 09:36.449
You got Clive to sign
the phony one,

09:36.493 --> 09:39.123
and then you forged
his signature on the real one.

09:39.162 --> 09:41.462
Abusing the fact that
he settled out of court

09:41.498 --> 09:44.918
and had no way to verify the
accuracy of what he had signed.

09:44.959 --> 09:47.379
And when we looked into
other cases you’ve handled,

09:47.420 --> 09:49.260
well,
we found dozens of clients

09:49.297 --> 09:51.167
who were forced
into private arbitration

09:51.216 --> 09:52.926
so their settlement amounts

09:52.967 --> 09:54.837
would never make it
to the press.

09:54.886 --> 09:56.426
And with all your clients
signing NDAs

09:56.471 --> 09:58.311
and no reason
not to trust you,

09:58.348 --> 10:01.268
well, they had no way of knowing
you were robbing them blind.

10:01.309 --> 10:03.309
You’ll have to prove that
in court.

10:03.353 --> 10:05.523
No, we could.
But we’d rather do something

10:05.563 --> 10:09.483
that’s well within
your wheelhouse -- settle.

10:09.526 --> 10:12.146
Settle.
In a manner of speaking.

10:12.195 --> 10:15.625
We want to know who
you’re funneling that money to.

10:15.657 --> 10:16.817
I don’t understand.

10:16.866 --> 10:18.196
Well, you don’t seem to be
sitting on it

10:18.243 --> 10:19.453
anywhere that we can find,

10:19.494 --> 10:22.204
so either you’re hiding it
very, very well,

10:22.247 --> 10:25.877
or else you’re bankrolling
something -- or somebody.

10:25.917 --> 10:27.377
Look, we have you
dead to rights.

10:27.418 --> 10:28.838
It’s not a matter of
if you’re going to prison,

10:28.878 --> 10:30.168
but for how long.

10:30.213 --> 10:31.963
If you want to inform
on your confederates,

10:32.006 --> 10:35.546
well, maybe we
could work something out.

10:40.223 --> 10:41.183
Fine.

10:41.224 --> 10:42.734
I took the money.

10:42.767 --> 10:44.387
But there’s no conspiracy,
unless we’re talking about

10:44.435 --> 10:45.895
how much it costs
to get your kids

10:45.937 --> 10:47.477
into a good school
these days.

10:47.522 --> 10:52.152
$20,000 per kid per year,
and that’s just preschool.

10:52.193 --> 10:54.573
It doubles with
every graduation.

10:54.612 --> 10:56.742
Then there’s the vacations,
the cars,

10:56.781 --> 10:59.621
my commitment on
the board of Wild Society...

11:02.412 --> 11:04.332
We bought a beach house
last year.

11:04.372 --> 11:07.002
2,500 square feet
in Key Biscayne.

11:07.041 --> 11:08.421
But that’s it.

11:08.459 --> 11:10.339
I’m being honest when I say
I have no idea

11:10.378 --> 11:14.008
why you think there’s
anything more to this.

11:14.048 --> 11:15.928
She’s provided documentation
that proves

11:15.967 --> 11:18.427
everything she said
was true.

11:18.469 --> 11:21.389
Anders wasn’t funding anything
but her own lifestyle.

11:21.431 --> 11:23.771
Reddington tells us
about a crooked lawyer,

11:23.808 --> 11:25.058
and we go and we look

11:25.101 --> 11:27.481
and we find a crooked lawyer,
case closed?

11:27.520 --> 11:29.770
I know I haven’t been around
as long as you guys,

11:29.814 --> 11:31.944
but doesn’t it seem
a little open and shut

11:31.983 --> 11:33.283
for a Reddington case?

11:33.318 --> 11:34.898
Dembe: This feels too simple
for Raymond.

11:34.944 --> 11:37.824
I can’t help but suspect there’s
another shoe waiting to drop.

11:37.864 --> 11:39.034
Well, I hear that,

11:39.073 --> 11:40.573
I just don’t see
how it belongs to Anders.

11:40.617 --> 11:42.657
We don’t know what
Reddington’s angle is,

11:42.702 --> 11:43.832
but that’s nothing new.

11:43.870 --> 11:45.040
We need to keep working.

11:45.079 --> 11:46.499
We still have two cases
to solve.

11:46.539 --> 11:48.919
If we can close all three,
that’s a win in my book.

11:48.958 --> 11:52.458
Malik: I just wish we knew
what Reddington was up to.

13:11.291 --> 13:16.801
Wexford Fertility responded
to our subpoena.

13:16.838 --> 13:19.838
That’s the list of everyone
who had embryos at the clinic.

13:19.882 --> 13:21.182
So any of the people
on this list

13:21.217 --> 13:22.717
could have been
the target of the hack.

13:22.760 --> 13:24.680
Except, I don’t think
it was a hack.

13:24.721 --> 13:26.061
What do you mean?

13:26.097 --> 13:27.887
I just got the report back
from the Cyber Action Team,

13:27.932 --> 13:29.352
and here’s the thing --

13:29.392 --> 13:32.022
the attacker shut down
the backup generator remotely,

13:32.061 --> 13:34.441
but not through
unauthorized means.

13:34.480 --> 13:37.610
They exploited a backdoor
in the clinic’s network servers.

13:37.650 --> 13:40.150
It’s the type of access point
that companies put in place

13:40.194 --> 13:42.614
to conduct
regular maintenance.

13:42.655 --> 13:43.945
It was very well hidden.

13:43.990 --> 13:46.330
Our Cyber Team has
cutting-edge resources

13:46.367 --> 13:47.987
and even they
almost missed it.

13:48.036 --> 13:50.906
This is either the work
of a very talented hacker

13:50.955 --> 13:54.035
with even more resources
than the FBI,

13:54.083 --> 13:56.043
or somebody already
in the system.

13:56.085 --> 13:57.915
Who maintains
the security server?

13:57.962 --> 14:00.922
A company called
Addabbo CommTech.

14:00.965 --> 14:02.295
As in
Alexander Addabbo?

14:02.342 --> 14:05.302
He’s the founder and CEO
of the company. Why?

14:05.345 --> 14:08.065
He and his wife had embryos
destroyed in the attack.

14:08.097 --> 14:11.847
So the man that owns the company
had his own embryos there?

14:11.893 --> 14:13.563
That can’t be
a coincidence.

14:13.603 --> 14:16.653
You think
he was the target?
Or the attacker.

14:16.689 --> 14:19.529
Either way, we need to talk to
him and find out what he knows.

14:23.112 --> 14:25.952
[ Cellphone rings ]

14:28.826 --> 14:30.786
Hey. How’d it go?
What did Jill say?

14:30.828 --> 14:32.958
I-I --
I couldn’t face her.

14:32.997 --> 14:34.417
You didn’t go?

14:34.457 --> 14:37.077
No, I-I-I-I-I had my hand
on the door handle,

14:37.126 --> 14:39.836
and I-I-I saw
the back of her head

14:39.879 --> 14:42.339
and I-I just --
I ran away.

14:42.382 --> 14:44.092
Look, I can’t do this for you,
alright?

14:44.133 --> 14:46.843
This is something you have
to want to do for yourself.

14:46.886 --> 14:48.296
I do.
I-It’s just --

14:48.346 --> 14:50.926
Look, I-I still love
her so much, and if --

14:50.973 --> 14:52.603
What if she
doesn’t forgive me?

14:52.642 --> 14:55.312
Nothing could get me spinning
out of control more than that.

14:55.353 --> 14:57.983
And -- And if that happens,
then, you know,

14:58.022 --> 14:59.982
I don’t know what
I’m in recovery for.

15:00.024 --> 15:01.444
You’re in recovery
for you.

15:01.484 --> 15:04.284
And one conversation with her
won’t solve everything,

15:04.320 --> 15:07.700
but you’ve got to keep
taking steps forward.

15:07.740 --> 15:08.990
It’s hard.

15:09.033 --> 15:11.333
Okay, but usually
the hardest things

15:11.369 --> 15:15.039
are the things that
are most worth doing.

15:15.081 --> 15:17.121
Listen, I’ve got to go.

15:20.711 --> 15:22.051
Remember our three obits?

15:22.088 --> 15:23.458
Raymond said that they were
put out of their misery

15:23.506 --> 15:25.546
by some demented
Angel of Mercy.

15:25.591 --> 15:28.681
Well, before we put
the cart before the Angel,

15:28.719 --> 15:30.139
or, uh, no.

15:30.179 --> 15:33.139
Should it be before we put
the Angel before the cart --

15:33.182 --> 15:35.142
Herbie, focus.

15:35.184 --> 15:37.144
Right.
Before we can catch a criminal,

15:37.186 --> 15:38.686
we have to prove
that there was a crime.

15:38.729 --> 15:41.149
And to do that, we need to know
how these patients died.

15:41.190 --> 15:43.360
Obtaining medical records
after the fact ain’t easy,

15:43.401 --> 15:45.821
but luckily,
I’ve got friends.

15:45.862 --> 15:46.952
In high places?

15:46.988 --> 15:48.158
More like
creepy basements.

15:48.197 --> 15:49.907
That’s where
they hide pathologists.

15:49.949 --> 15:51.409
It’s so you don’t see
a bunch of dead bodies

15:51.451 --> 15:54.161
and the creeps that work on them
on your way in the door.

15:54.203 --> 15:55.913
Our three victims
were hospitalized

15:55.955 --> 15:57.155
for very different reasons --

15:57.206 --> 16:00.126
cancer treatment, hip surgery,
appendicitis --

16:00.168 --> 16:03.878
but they all died
the same way -- cardiac arrest.

16:03.921 --> 16:05.171
Is that surprising?

16:05.214 --> 16:07.014
It’s the leading cause of death
in the US.

16:07.049 --> 16:08.179
But yeah,
heart failure happens.

16:08.217 --> 16:09.717
It’s why nobody thought
it was weird

16:09.760 --> 16:11.100
when these guys
keeled over.

16:11.137 --> 16:12.887
And their autopsies
were pretty unremarkable.

16:12.930 --> 16:14.180
No drugs, no toxins --

16:14.223 --> 16:16.893
nothing in their system
to indicate foul play.

16:16.934 --> 16:18.564
But then I noticed
a weird pattern.

16:18.603 --> 16:21.943
With cardiac arrest, you expect
to see contributing factors --

16:21.981 --> 16:23.361
clogged arteries,
high blood pressure,

16:23.399 --> 16:25.779
the sound of
your mother-in-law’s voice --

16:25.818 --> 16:28.198
or is that
just my trigger?

16:28.237 --> 16:31.697
Anyway, check out the box
for secondary cause of death.

16:31.741 --> 16:33.201
Blank
on every single form.

16:33.242 --> 16:36.082
I combed over their charts --
no underlying heart problems.

16:36.120 --> 16:37.410
But then
I looked at their meds.

16:37.455 --> 16:40.215
They were all given
potassium chloride.

16:40.249 --> 16:42.079
Isn’t that what they use
in lethal injections?

16:42.126 --> 16:43.206
You see where I’m going.

16:43.252 --> 16:45.212
But potassium on its own
isn’t lethal.

16:45.254 --> 16:47.214
Our bodies actually need
a certain amount to function,

16:47.256 --> 16:49.086
but it’s a delicate balance.

16:49.133 --> 16:50.763
You give someone too much,
too quick,

16:50.801 --> 16:52.011
their heart goes bananas,

16:52.053 --> 16:53.393
before it stops beating
altogether.

16:53.429 --> 16:55.469
If these patients
OD’d on potassium,

16:55.515 --> 16:57.225
wouldn’t their autopsies
show that?

16:57.266 --> 16:59.226
Well, when you die,
your red blood cells rupture,

16:59.268 --> 17:01.058
flooding your plasma
with potassium.

17:01.103 --> 17:02.903
So basically,
everyone looks like

17:02.939 --> 17:04.229
they had
an overdose postmortem.

17:04.273 --> 17:06.653
A fatal injection is impossible
to prove,

17:06.692 --> 17:08.242
making it
a pretty ideal drug

17:08.277 --> 17:10.737
if you’re a doctor trying
to commit a perfect murder.

17:10.780 --> 17:12.110
So we have our method.

17:12.156 --> 17:13.446
Where’s our Angel?

17:13.491 --> 17:15.241
Look through
hospital employee records --

17:15.284 --> 17:17.084
find out who administered
the potassium,

17:17.119 --> 17:18.499
or could’ve tampered
with the dose.

17:18.538 --> 17:21.118
Considering what we know
about Angels of Mercy,

17:21.165 --> 17:22.615
and their high body counts,

17:22.667 --> 17:26.587
we could be dealing with
a prolific serial killer.

17:26.629 --> 17:29.629
Revill: Always happy to take
on a new client, Mr. Homan.

17:29.674 --> 17:31.594
What can I do for you?

17:31.634 --> 17:35.264
This young woman --
who is she?

17:35.304 --> 17:36.684
I can’t reveal
who I work for.

17:36.722 --> 17:39.272
I’m not asking who paid you
for the photos.

17:39.308 --> 17:41.518
I’m asking
who’s in them.

17:41.561 --> 17:44.771
Well, I’m sorry,
I can’t tell you that either.

17:44.814 --> 17:49.574
You know, I consider myself
something of an investigator.

17:49.610 --> 17:54.360
I took the liberty of looking
into you and your life.

17:54.407 --> 17:55.867
I’m sorry, are you
threatening me?

17:55.908 --> 17:57.698
Well,
I wasn’t going to.

17:57.743 --> 18:01.293
I thought I might be able
to come up with something --

18:01.330 --> 18:03.500
maybe do something nice
for your son --

18:03.541 --> 18:05.581
I hear he’s a great
football player.

18:05.626 --> 18:08.086
I don’t know --
season tickets, club level.

18:08.129 --> 18:09.419
Something like that.

18:09.463 --> 18:12.303
Or maybe something
for you and your wife.

18:12.341 --> 18:13.841
But you know what?
Screw it.

18:13.884 --> 18:17.554
Maybe it’s just easier
to put a hole in your foot.

18:21.017 --> 18:22.807
So who’s the girl?

18:24.895 --> 18:26.305
Her name’s Abby Ryder.

18:26.355 --> 18:29.525
And what connection does
Abby Ryder have to your client?

18:29.567 --> 18:31.397
I don’t know.
He never told me.

18:31.444 --> 18:34.074
But when I found her,
she had gotten herself

18:34.113 --> 18:36.453
into sort of a bad scene.

18:36.490 --> 18:37.530
How bad?

18:37.575 --> 18:39.335
She had been busted
a couple times.

18:39.368 --> 18:42.328
Petty stuff. Um, shoplifting,
a little drugs.

18:42.371 --> 18:46.131
Nothing stuck, but, you know,
those things add up.

18:46.167 --> 18:48.667
She was definitely in
with the wrong crowd.

18:50.504 --> 18:52.054
These are our victims’
care teams --

18:52.089 --> 18:53.549
every doctor, nurse,
or med tech

18:53.591 --> 18:55.301
that could’ve spiked
their medications.

18:55.343 --> 18:57.553
Remember, these patients
were treated in different units,

18:57.595 --> 19:00.225
in different hospitals,
so there’s basically no overlap.

19:00.264 --> 19:02.894
Except for one name --
Dawn Jacobus.

19:02.933 --> 19:05.563
She’s a "floater" nurse,
so she doesn’t have a specialty.

19:05.603 --> 19:07.563
She just fills in wherever
there’s a shortage,

19:07.605 --> 19:09.365
giving her access
to every unit.

19:09.398 --> 19:11.068
She’s changed jobs
a lot this year.

19:11.108 --> 19:14.108
It’s not unusual for a nurse,
but the timing’s suspicious.

19:14.153 --> 19:15.363
Whenever a patient died,

19:15.404 --> 19:17.114
she’d be at a new hospital
within weeks.

19:17.156 --> 19:18.656
There’s one
slight problem --

19:18.699 --> 19:21.199
she wasn’t on duty when
our third victim passed away.

19:21.243 --> 19:22.583
She clocked out
the night before.

19:22.620 --> 19:25.250
Is it possible she spiked
his IV before she left?

19:25.289 --> 19:27.249
How long would it take
the potassium to kill him?

19:27.291 --> 19:30.251
Depends on the dose,
his age, weight, IV type.

19:30.294 --> 19:31.384
Maybe it took
all morning?

19:31.420 --> 19:33.090
Or maybe
our nurse just visited

19:33.130 --> 19:34.460
her favorite patient
on her day off.

19:34.507 --> 19:36.377
The pieces may not fit
together perfectly.

19:36.425 --> 19:37.715
If she’s at work
right now,

19:37.760 --> 19:40.050
someone’s life could be
in serious danger.

19:40.096 --> 19:43.386
Hey, Emma.
Good morning.

19:43.432 --> 19:46.102
Melanie Andrews is
out of Intensive Care?

19:46.143 --> 19:47.313
Yeah.
She’s doing so much better.

19:47.353 --> 19:49.233
They moved her up here
this morning.

19:49.271 --> 19:50.811
Bless her heart.

19:50.856 --> 19:53.106
I’m just gonna go see
if there’s anything I can do

19:53.150 --> 19:54.990
to make her feel more...

19:55.027 --> 19:56.567
comfortable.

19:56.570 --> 20:02.280
.

20:02.284 --> 20:08.334
Excuse me.
Agent Ressler, FBI.

20:08.374 --> 20:10.174
I need to speak with a nurse,
Dawn Jacobus.

20:10.209 --> 20:11.629
Your Director
just called --

20:11.669 --> 20:13.129
but we make it a policy
not to interrupt anyone

20:13.170 --> 20:15.300
in the middle of rounds,
that’s how mistakes are made.

20:15.339 --> 20:18.429
I don’t think you understand.
What did my boss tell you?

20:19.677 --> 20:22.097
Hello, dear.
How are you feeling?

20:22.138 --> 20:24.098
A bit dehydrated?

20:24.140 --> 20:26.640
I’ve got something
that’ll fix you right up.

20:26.684 --> 20:29.314
I just can’t believe --
Are you sure?

20:29.353 --> 20:30.653
Dawn seems so --
Where is she now?

20:30.688 --> 20:32.688
She’s with a patient --
room 303.

20:32.732 --> 20:35.692
I bet you can’t wait
to get out of that bed.

20:35.735 --> 20:41.575
Don’t worry, I’ll have you
in a better place real soon.

20:44.994 --> 20:46.204
Dawn Jacobus?

20:46.245 --> 20:47.495
Oh, my goodness,
you scared me.

20:47.538 --> 20:49.538
No, stop.
Don’t touch that.

20:49.582 --> 20:51.252
Step away
from the patient.

20:51.292 --> 20:55.092
Wha--
Oh, my goodness.

20:57.339 --> 21:01.509
Mr. Addabbo, Mrs. Addabbo,
we were sorry to hear

21:01.552 --> 21:04.262
about the loss
of your embryos.

21:04.305 --> 21:05.895
Thank you.

21:05.931 --> 21:09.851
I assume anything I say
to the FBI is confidential?

21:09.894 --> 21:12.354
Of course,
whatever you can tell us

21:12.396 --> 21:15.106
that will help
the investigation.

21:15.149 --> 21:18.739
This isn’t something
I’ve admitted to the press.

21:18.778 --> 21:22.568
I had surgery for
testicular cancer last year.

21:22.615 --> 21:25.415
We made our embryos
before the procedure.

21:25.451 --> 21:27.411
So they’re not
replaceable?

21:27.453 --> 21:30.293
No.
They’re not.

21:30.331 --> 21:33.131
Can you think of any reason
someone would want

21:33.167 --> 21:36.797
to prevent you
from having children?

21:36.837 --> 21:38.337
Why would you
ask that?

21:38.380 --> 21:40.880
We believe that the attack
on the storage facility

21:40.925 --> 21:44.595
was conducted using
an exploit in your software.

21:44.637 --> 21:47.717
You think someone attacked
Wexford just to harm us?

21:47.765 --> 21:49.735
Maybe.
I can’t think of anyone.

21:49.767 --> 21:51.267
This must be
a horrible coincidence.

21:51.310 --> 21:53.900
Alexander...

21:53.938 --> 21:56.018
No.

21:56.065 --> 21:57.615
Aimee, don’t.
Wagner: Hello?

21:57.650 --> 21:59.530
Can you come to
the conference room, please?

21:59.568 --> 22:00.778
Sure.

22:00.820 --> 22:02.240
There is no way
he could have done this.

22:02.279 --> 22:03.409
You always do this.

22:03.447 --> 22:04.907
You always protect him.

22:04.949 --> 22:06.029
I do not.

22:06.075 --> 22:07.875
Protect whom?

22:14.667 --> 22:16.417
What’s going on, Dad?

22:16.460 --> 22:18.460
"Dad"?

22:22.091 --> 22:25.301
Dembe: You are
Alexander Addabbo’s son,

22:25.344 --> 22:26.804
but you go by Wagner?

22:26.846 --> 22:28.846
I never wanted to be accused
of nepotism,

22:28.889 --> 22:31.059
so I use my mother’s name.

22:31.100 --> 22:32.310
Is that a crime?

22:32.351 --> 22:34.271
We talked to
Sandy Roberts.

22:34.311 --> 22:36.771
She said you were the one
who approached Wexford

22:36.814 --> 22:39.734
about using Addabbo
for their network security.

22:39.775 --> 22:42.065
Even gave her
a great deal.

22:42.111 --> 22:43.401
I brought in an account.

22:43.445 --> 22:46.905
It’s a little outside your
purview, though, isn’t it?

22:46.949 --> 22:49.619
A CTO is supposed to
improve the tech,

22:49.660 --> 22:50.950
not drum up new clients.

22:50.995 --> 22:52.955
Unless there was
a special reason

22:52.997 --> 22:55.077
you wanted Wexford
to use your system?

22:55.124 --> 22:58.424
It’s the IVF clinic where your
parents have embryos, right?

22:58.460 --> 23:00.050
My parents?

23:00.087 --> 23:02.007
That bimbo is practically
young enough to be my daughter.

23:02.047 --> 23:05.587
It’s disgusting thinking of them
procreating, even a test tube.

23:05.634 --> 23:07.474
That’s why you attacked
the clinic?

23:07.511 --> 23:08.891
Because
you were disgusted?

23:08.929 --> 23:12.469
No. I --
But you did attack them?

23:12.516 --> 23:13.926
It wasn’t an attack,
really,

23:13.976 --> 23:18.106
since you already had a key
to the backdoor.

23:18.147 --> 23:21.267
You waited for a storm to give
you the blackout you needed,

23:21.317 --> 23:22.817
and then let yourself in.

23:22.860 --> 23:24.610
Only you weren’t
counting on the FBI

23:24.653 --> 23:26.953
to come knocking as well.

23:29.825 --> 23:33.115
I’ve worked my entire adult life
for my father.

23:33.162 --> 23:35.662
He wrote the foundational code
that started CommTech,

23:35.706 --> 23:39.376
but I’m the one who kept us
relevant in the 21st century.

23:39.418 --> 23:42.998
I’m not gonna split half
of everything I’ve worked for

23:43.047 --> 23:45.797
with a couple cells
in a petri dish.

23:47.885 --> 23:51.105
You know, Todd, it takes
a lot to build a family.

23:51.138 --> 23:54.518
My own mother was willing
to sacrifice anything.

23:54.558 --> 23:58.228
When I think about all those
families and their dreams,

23:58.270 --> 23:59.730
about what was lost...

23:59.772 --> 24:02.862
what you destroyed
for money...

24:02.900 --> 24:04.860
You should be glad you’re
talking to me and not my mother,

24:04.902 --> 24:08.952
because she would’ve left you
broken and bleeding.

24:13.369 --> 24:14.739
I need about 20 minutes.

24:14.787 --> 24:15.907
Won’t be a problem,
Mr. Homan.

24:15.955 --> 24:17.045
And the other drivers?

24:17.081 --> 24:18.171
I radioed everyone
on my route.

24:18.207 --> 24:19.707
You’re all set.
[ Cellphone vibrates ]

24:19.750 --> 24:20.960
Thank you for the, uh --

24:21.001 --> 24:23.171
Contribution to
the pension fund.

24:23.212 --> 24:24.552
Right, pension fund.

24:24.588 --> 24:27.548
Guess I can finally afford
to retire.

24:27.591 --> 24:29.181
Harold.
Cooper: I’ll be brief.

24:29.218 --> 24:30.758
There’s not much to say
about these

24:30.803 --> 24:32.183
Blacklisters you gave us.

24:32.221 --> 24:35.021
The crooked lawyer’s probably
making bail as we speak.

24:35.057 --> 24:38.137
Our suspect in the IVF case is
on his way to central booking.

24:38.185 --> 24:40.725
And we’re about to interrogate
the Angel of Mercy.

24:40.771 --> 24:42.111
I’m glad to hear it.

24:42.147 --> 24:44.897
I guess many hands
do make light the work.

24:44.942 --> 24:46.362
That’s not my point.

24:46.402 --> 24:48.782
These cases, I don’t know
how else to say it,

24:48.821 --> 24:50.741
they weren’t
that hard to solve.

24:50.781 --> 24:53.581
Not for a crack team
like yours, anyway.

24:53.617 --> 24:54.907
Can we skip to the part

24:54.952 --> 24:58.292
where you tell me
what this is really about?

24:58.330 --> 24:59.580
Must go, Harold.

24:59.623 --> 25:01.883
Talk soon.

25:01.917 --> 25:03.587
Has the 56 come yet?

25:03.627 --> 25:05.627
You just missed it.

25:05.671 --> 25:08.171
I’m sure another will be
along shortly.

25:08.215 --> 25:11.965
Well, you were only at Memorial
for what, three months, right?

25:12.011 --> 25:14.761
Why the sudden transfer
to St. Damian’s?

25:14.805 --> 25:18.235
Better rate,
better hours.

25:18.267 --> 25:20.937
It had nothing
to do with Navin?

25:20.978 --> 25:23.728
Navin Mahadevan?
You remember him, right?

25:23.772 --> 25:26.402
Of course.
That poor man.

25:26.442 --> 25:28.072
I’ve lost patients before,

25:28.110 --> 25:31.360
but with him,
it was a terrible shock.

25:31.405 --> 25:33.785
Did you know that
when a veterinarian

25:33.824 --> 25:37.624
euthanizes a dog with, say,
a shot of potassium,

25:37.661 --> 25:39.621
they always put the dog
under first.

25:39.663 --> 25:41.673
Why do you think
they do that?

25:41.707 --> 25:44.577
Well, I suppose with
that much potassium,

25:44.626 --> 25:48.796
enough to stop the heart,
it’d be pretty painful.

25:48.839 --> 25:50.219
Navin was in a lot of pain,
wasn’t he?

25:50.257 --> 25:52.797
I don’t see the connection
with that.

25:52.843 --> 25:54.843
It says right here
in your notes --

25:54.887 --> 25:58.767
"Patient complained of pain
at the IV injection site."

25:58.807 --> 26:00.387
You prescribed lidocaine.

26:00.434 --> 26:01.814
Oh, sure.

26:01.852 --> 26:03.982
But those infusions
can be uncomfortable.

26:04.021 --> 26:05.811
Everyone has a different
pain tolerance.

26:05.856 --> 26:08.146
I just didn’t want him
to suffer.

26:08.192 --> 26:10.822
With the amount of potassium
you were pumping into him,

26:10.861 --> 26:14.411
it musta felt like liquid fire
going up his arm.

26:14.448 --> 26:17.828
Excuse me?

26:17.868 --> 26:20.118
See, they call people
like you Angels of Mercy,

26:20.162 --> 26:24.122
but you don’t seem
very merciful to me.

26:26.585 --> 26:28.795
Oh, my God.

26:28.837 --> 26:30.007
Is that what you think?

26:30.047 --> 26:33.717
That I killed
my own patients?

26:38.555 --> 26:39.845
What’s the emergency?

26:39.890 --> 26:41.680
I almost, uh --
-You need to hear this.

26:41.725 --> 26:43.845
We might have
jumped the gun.

26:43.894 --> 26:45.154
What does that mean?

26:45.187 --> 26:46.937
I tested the nurse’s
IV bag from today.

26:46.980 --> 26:48.860
10 milliequivalents
of potassium.

26:48.899 --> 26:50.149
It’s totally harmless.

26:50.192 --> 26:51.942
So I looked at the other samples
from the bags

26:51.985 --> 26:54.735
recovered from the dispensary --
Most of them tested fine.

26:54.780 --> 26:56.240
But then this one --

26:56.281 --> 26:58.741
it has 10 times more potassium
than the label says it does.

26:58.784 --> 27:00.244
Enough to kill someone.

27:00.285 --> 27:02.115
We didn’t expect her to spike
every IV in the place.

27:02.162 --> 27:04.872
Only the ones for, you know,
"special" patients.

27:04.915 --> 27:07.675
Yeah, except she never
touched this bag.

27:07.709 --> 27:09.039
Nobody did.

27:09.086 --> 27:10.706
It was sitting on a shelf,
sealed inside a box.

27:10.754 --> 27:12.054
How is that possible?

27:12.089 --> 27:13.879
These IV bags aren’t prepped
at the hospital --

27:13.924 --> 27:15.884
they come pre-mixed
from a drug company --

27:15.926 --> 27:17.886
Kolbeck Medical Solutions.

27:17.928 --> 27:19.718
Ironically, nurses use
pre-filled bags

27:19.763 --> 27:21.723
to avoid overmedicating
by mistake.

27:21.765 --> 27:23.095
Which happens more
than you think.

27:23.142 --> 27:24.982
Wait, so they had a bag
of liquid death

27:25.018 --> 27:26.138
sitting on their shelf,

27:26.186 --> 27:28.056
all because some factory
messed up?

27:28.105 --> 27:30.275
It’s not
an Angel of Mercy.

27:30.315 --> 27:34.315
These patients are dying because
of a manufacturing error.

27:34.361 --> 27:36.241
Abby:
Where the hell’s the bus?

27:36.280 --> 27:38.740
There’s usually
another one by now.

27:38.782 --> 27:41.872
Late for class?

27:41.910 --> 27:42.910
You look like
you’re freezing.

27:42.953 --> 27:44.913
You’re not
wearing enough.

27:44.955 --> 27:48.465
Yeah, no, I’m not.

27:48.500 --> 27:50.590
Criminology?
Fascinating.

27:50.627 --> 27:52.297
Is that
what you’re studying?

27:52.337 --> 27:53.457
Oh.

27:53.505 --> 27:54.915
Yeah.

27:54.965 --> 27:58.395
And I have a test later,
if I can get to campus.

27:58.427 --> 27:59.757
SIU?

27:59.803 --> 28:00.803
That’s a good school.

28:00.846 --> 28:03.216
Some notable alumni.

28:03.265 --> 28:04.645
Really?

28:04.683 --> 28:07.103
My whole class seems destined
for middle management.

28:07.144 --> 28:09.524
There’s lots of people
you’d...

28:09.563 --> 28:12.073
Well, one might know.

28:12.107 --> 28:16.947
Steve James the documentarian --
"Hoop Dreams."

28:16.987 --> 28:18.907
Well, there’s the great
Civil Rights leader

28:18.947 --> 28:21.277
and comedian,
Dick Gregory.

28:21.325 --> 28:22.955
I dunno...

28:22.993 --> 28:25.623
Oh, well, your Congressman
then --

28:25.662 --> 28:28.872
Arthur Hudson.

28:28.916 --> 28:29.996
Who’s he?

28:30.042 --> 28:31.842
You don’t know?

28:31.877 --> 28:33.547
When I said his name,
you looked like --

28:33.587 --> 28:37.667
I don’t follow politics,
or politicians.

28:37.716 --> 28:39.376
That’s strange.

28:39.426 --> 28:42.136
Why is that strange?

28:42.179 --> 28:44.349
Because
he’s following you.

28:46.850 --> 28:48.810
What do you want?

28:48.852 --> 28:50.982
I want to understand.

28:51.021 --> 28:54.651
Tell me how you know
Arthur Hudson.

28:54.691 --> 28:56.821
How do I know him?

28:56.860 --> 28:58.900
He ruined my life.

28:58.904 --> 29:05.244
.

29:05.244 --> 29:08.624
Cooper:
Did our theory check out?

29:08.664 --> 29:10.004
We’ve pulled stock
from five metro area hospitals.

29:10.040 --> 29:11.500
I haven’t
tested everything yet,

29:11.541 --> 29:13.501
but I’ve already found half
a dozen mis-filled IV bags.

29:13.543 --> 29:16.343
All from the same company --
Kolbeck Medical Solutions.

29:16.380 --> 29:18.090
So there might be
more victims.

29:18.131 --> 29:19.921
Look, this case could be bigger
than we ever thought.

29:19.967 --> 29:21.427
I’ve alerted my contact
at the FDA.

29:21.468 --> 29:23.428
Drug Security and Response
will handle the recall,

29:23.470 --> 29:26.100
but Agents Ressler and Malik,
you get over to Kolbeck.

29:26.139 --> 29:28.769
We need to understand what went
wrong on that factory floor.

29:28.809 --> 29:33.859
I was 12 when my parents
got convicted.

29:33.897 --> 29:35.317
Whatever they had
went to the lawyers.

29:35.357 --> 29:38.527
They should’ve
saved their money.

29:38.568 --> 29:39.688
My mom got 11 years.

29:39.736 --> 29:43.446
My dad went down for 20.

29:43.490 --> 29:45.200
Who took care of you?

29:45.242 --> 29:49.202
Uh, I lived with my Grandma
for a while, but she died,

29:49.246 --> 29:53.536
and there was no one else,
so I ended up in the system.

29:53.583 --> 29:56.803
Didn’t really seem like anyone
cared what happened to me.

29:56.837 --> 29:59.127
But someone must’ve,

29:59.172 --> 30:01.172
’cause these packages
would show up

30:01.216 --> 30:04.006
at whatever foster home
I was in --

30:04.052 --> 30:08.562
a new winter coat
or stuff for school.

30:08.598 --> 30:10.018
But then I turned 18,

30:10.058 --> 30:12.018
and I wasn’t
the state’s problem anymore.

30:12.060 --> 30:15.060
So, you lost
any kind of support.

30:15.105 --> 30:20.945
Most kids like me end up
homeless, or in jail, or...

30:20.986 --> 30:23.316
whatever.

30:23.363 --> 30:25.873
That’s when you met
Arthur Hudson?

30:25.907 --> 30:27.697
What? No.

30:27.743 --> 30:29.083
You said
he ruined your life.

30:29.119 --> 30:30.449
Eight years ago.

30:30.495 --> 30:32.825
When he worked in
the US Attorney’s Office.

30:32.873 --> 30:35.213
He put my parents
in prison.

30:35.250 --> 30:41.170
But he didn’t think I should
have to be punished, too.

30:41.214 --> 30:44.974
So he sort of
looked out for me.

30:45.010 --> 30:49.600
Checked in with my case manager,
sent me stuff.

30:49.639 --> 30:52.099
The new clothes,
things for school?

30:52.142 --> 30:55.522
Yeah,
those were from him.

30:55.562 --> 30:59.272
But when I aged out, he didn’t
know what happened to me.

30:59.316 --> 31:02.186
That’s why he hired
the Private Investigator.

31:02.235 --> 31:04.445
He was looking for you
so he could help you.

31:04.488 --> 31:05.738
Yeah.

31:05.781 --> 31:10.081
He took care of some bills,
got me back in school.

31:10.118 --> 31:12.538
Things aren’t perfect
or anything,

31:12.579 --> 31:20.089
but I guess it’s just nice
to have him around.

31:20.128 --> 31:21.958
I’m just trying
to make a life.

31:22.005 --> 31:24.125
A better one.

31:27.386 --> 31:29.886
Is that what you expected
to hear?

31:29.930 --> 31:31.890
No. It isn’t.

31:31.932 --> 31:34.182
It’s a pleasant surprise.

31:36.144 --> 31:40.194
I’m glad you have someone
in your corner.

31:42.526 --> 31:45.486
Kolbeck’s been in business
for 70 years.

31:45.529 --> 31:48.819
Our reputation for delivering
high-quality medical products

31:48.865 --> 31:50.525
is above reproach.

31:50.575 --> 31:53.655
You mean, except for that pile
of IV bags sitting on my desk.

31:53.703 --> 31:56.963
You know, the ones with the
fatal dose of potassium in it?

31:56.998 --> 31:59.418
Fatal is
a matter of opinion.

31:59.459 --> 32:01.169
I’m not here
to litigate the case.

32:01.211 --> 32:04.091
I just wanna know what went
wrong at your plant?

32:04.131 --> 32:05.591
We’re still trying
to figure that out.

32:05.632 --> 32:07.682
So you didn’t know there was
an issue with your machinery?

32:07.717 --> 32:09.967
That it was overfilling
random IV bags?

32:10.011 --> 32:11.431
Of course not.

32:11.471 --> 32:13.471
If we had, we would’ve ordered
an immediate recall.

32:13.515 --> 32:15.645
Or maybe you did notice
there was a problem

32:15.684 --> 32:17.354
and you just didn’t want
to damage that,

32:17.394 --> 32:20.024
you know,
spotless reputation of yours.

32:20.063 --> 32:21.193
Are you calling me
a liar?

32:21.231 --> 32:22.481
Either that
or incompetent,

32:22.524 --> 32:25.694
and I don’t know
which is really worse.

32:25.735 --> 32:27.145
Sorry to interrupt,

32:27.195 --> 32:29.355
but I just had a chat
with one of your technicians.

32:29.406 --> 32:31.236
According to his logs,
you shut down

32:31.283 --> 32:34.043
for a full recalibration
last October,

32:34.077 --> 32:36.697
exactly one week
after the tainted IV bags

32:36.746 --> 32:38.206
were shipped out.

32:38.248 --> 32:41.828
I don’t like what you’re
insinuating, young lady.

32:41.877 --> 32:43.127
Was I insinuating?

32:43.170 --> 32:44.460
How rude of me.

32:44.504 --> 32:47.724
What I meant was --
this timing looks really,

32:47.757 --> 32:51.177
really bad for you.

32:51.219 --> 32:53.049
I’m sure Mr. Walden
can explain this.

32:53.096 --> 32:56.016
Matt, go ahead.

32:56.057 --> 32:57.267
Um, hi.

32:57.309 --> 33:00.269
Matt Walden,
Product Standards Manager.

33:00.312 --> 33:02.362
It sounds like
the technician you spoke to

33:02.397 --> 33:04.517
must’ve been confused.

33:06.276 --> 33:08.436
Yes, we did shut down,

33:08.487 --> 33:11.067
but it was just regular
scheduled maintenance.

33:11.114 --> 33:12.874
Nothing special.

33:12.908 --> 33:14.738
We’ll be sure
to look into that.

33:14.784 --> 33:17.124
Thanks, Matt.

33:17.162 --> 33:20.502
Yes, and thank you both
for coming up here.

33:20.540 --> 33:23.170
Next time we’ll be meeting
through our lawyers.

33:23.210 --> 33:25.340
You’re gonna need ’em.

33:25.378 --> 33:28.258
You know, mistakes like this
don’t happen in a vacuum.

33:28.298 --> 33:30.048
Someone’s negligence
caused innocent people

33:30.091 --> 33:31.591
to suffer and die.

33:31.635 --> 33:34.145
And if we find out that you knew
your products were tainted,

33:34.179 --> 33:36.259
and didn’t order a recall,

33:36.306 --> 33:37.926
then everyone
in that decision chain

33:37.974 --> 33:40.104
will be answering
to the FBI.

33:40.143 --> 33:48.533
♪

33:48.568 --> 33:50.778
He seemed
a little guilty.

33:50.820 --> 33:52.950
Maybe a little.

33:52.989 --> 33:54.069
Shh, shh, shh.

33:54.115 --> 33:56.235
Over here.

33:59.829 --> 34:01.409
I shouldn’t even
be talking to you,

34:01.456 --> 34:03.786
but I don’t get paid enough
to go to prison.

34:03.833 --> 34:05.633
Guarantee my immunity,

34:05.669 --> 34:08.709
and I’ll blow this thing
wide open.

34:10.840 --> 34:12.300
The CEO knew.

34:12.342 --> 34:14.342
His techs found
the problem months ago.

34:14.386 --> 34:16.386
Less than 1% of the IV bags
were affected.

34:16.429 --> 34:19.349
Yeah, but they’d already shipped
out hundreds of thousands.

34:19.391 --> 34:20.601
He wouldn’t agree
to a recall

34:20.642 --> 34:22.642
without a thorough
cost/benefit analysis.

34:22.686 --> 34:24.516
Herbie: If Raymond hadn’t
turned us on to this case,

34:24.563 --> 34:26.523
it’s possible no one ever would
have made the connection.

34:26.565 --> 34:28.195
That’s what the CEO
was banking on.

34:28.233 --> 34:29.403
Literally banking.

34:29.442 --> 34:30.992
I wonder
what he’s thinking now?

34:31.027 --> 34:32.817
All that money might’ve
kept him out of prison,

34:32.862 --> 34:36.372
but a homicide charge
is pretty hard to live down.

34:36.408 --> 34:38.278
What about
the rest of these --

34:38.326 --> 34:40.616
Well, I’m not gonna even
call them Blacklisters.

34:40.662 --> 34:43.502
Three indictments,
not exactly a waste of time.

34:43.540 --> 34:45.500
But what did Reddington
promise us?

34:45.542 --> 34:48.172
An infamous hacker,
a serial killer,

34:48.211 --> 34:50.091
a lawyer orchestrating
a vast conspiracy.

34:50.130 --> 34:53.380
Instead, we got a son
squabbling over his inheritance,

34:53.425 --> 34:55.685
a CEO who valued profits
over safety,

34:55.719 --> 34:57.849
and a lawyer who’s
betraying her clients

34:57.887 --> 34:59.177
to line her own pockets.

34:59.222 --> 35:00.602
All criminals for sure,

35:00.640 --> 35:04.140
but hardly rising to the level
of this task force.

35:04.185 --> 35:05.685
So why these cases?

35:05.729 --> 35:07.439
What’s Reddington
getting out of it?

35:07.480 --> 35:09.690
Well, maybe he wanted to
keep us busy chasing our tails

35:09.733 --> 35:11.323
so we couldn’t
keep tabs on him.

35:11.359 --> 35:13.819
So he just looked through
a pile of cases

35:13.862 --> 35:16.162
and chose three rejects?

35:16.197 --> 35:17.407
Is he ever that random?

35:17.449 --> 35:19.659
Nothing he does
is random.

35:22.078 --> 35:23.118
Ressler: Wait, stop.

35:23.163 --> 35:24.913
Go back one.

35:28.335 --> 35:31.005
Wild Society --
I’ve heard of that somewhere.

35:31.046 --> 35:34.466
They do amazing work
to protect species biodiversity.

35:34.507 --> 35:37.007
Dembe: Wait, look who else
is in that photo.

35:37.052 --> 35:38.392
That’s Todd Wagner.

35:38.428 --> 35:40.558
And that’s
Rebecca Anders.

35:40.597 --> 35:43.557
"Wild Society Board of Directors
pose for winter gala.

35:43.600 --> 35:45.890
All proceeds to benefit
the charity..."

35:45.935 --> 35:48.185
Herbie: A shady lawyer,
a corrupt CEO,

35:48.229 --> 35:50.899
and an ungrateful heir
walk into a party --

35:50.940 --> 35:52.110
how does that joke end?

35:52.150 --> 35:53.320
With someone punching them
in the face?

35:53.360 --> 35:54.490
Now I’m more confused
then ever.

35:54.527 --> 35:55.897
Is this charity
the connection

35:55.945 --> 35:58.445
that Reddington really
wanted us to find?

35:58.490 --> 36:01.530
Maybe our real investigation
has only just begun.

36:01.534 --> 36:07.248
.

36:07.248 --> 36:11.168
I understand your board held
an emergency meeting last night?

36:11.211 --> 36:12.591
Our ad hoc board.

36:12.629 --> 36:14.259
The three individuals
you arrested have been

36:14.297 --> 36:17.127
removed indefinitely,
pending investigation.

36:17.175 --> 36:18.715
And our legal team
is advising us

36:18.760 --> 36:21.890
on the inherent
financial considerations.

36:21.930 --> 36:23.390
And how many people
are giving?

36:23.431 --> 36:25.731
We have about
6 million contributors,

36:25.767 --> 36:27.307
here and abroad.

36:27.352 --> 36:30.562
I’ve actually prepared
a binder for you.

36:33.149 --> 36:35.859
Obviously
it’s not everyone.

36:35.902 --> 36:38.912
But these are
our major donors.

36:42.867 --> 36:44.037
What about this one?

36:44.077 --> 36:46.577
There’s no name.

36:46.621 --> 36:48.161
Right.

36:48.206 --> 36:51.286
Well, big gifts can garner
a lot of publicity.

36:51.334 --> 36:53.214
That’s the appeal
for some donors.

36:53.253 --> 36:55.593
That one in particular,
he’s quite discreet.

36:55.630 --> 36:57.760
Wasn’t interested
in naming rights

36:57.799 --> 36:59.339
or a seat on the board.

36:59.384 --> 37:02.934
The only time he showed his face
was at our wind farm in Baja.

37:02.971 --> 37:04.601
He wanted to speak
with the engineers

37:04.639 --> 37:08.809
about some advancement
in turbine rotors.

37:08.852 --> 37:10.652
His name?

37:10.687 --> 37:12.097
Please understand --

37:12.147 --> 37:15.477
he has been foundational
to our growth this last decade.

37:15.525 --> 37:17.865
We’re in the final stages
of accepting a gift from him

37:17.902 --> 37:21.162
that would carry us
into the next century.

37:21.197 --> 37:22.697
I’m not willing to jeopardize
any of that.

37:22.741 --> 37:26.661
You should know, I already filed
a subpoena for your records.

37:26.703 --> 37:28.413
I don’t mean that
as some kind of threat,

37:28.455 --> 37:30.965
but I’m gonna need
this information either way.

37:30.999 --> 37:32.329
Let’s be honest --

37:32.375 --> 37:34.285
your donor would want
to clear up any conflicts

37:34.335 --> 37:37.665
before he gave a gift
of this size anyway.

37:39.758 --> 37:42.338
You’re right.

37:42.385 --> 37:46.255
This is for
internal use only.

37:46.306 --> 37:47.966
It’s the first name there.

37:48.016 --> 37:50.976
Mr. Homan, Steven.

37:51.019 --> 37:52.729
Steve Homan?

37:52.771 --> 37:53.771
Yes, do you know him?

37:53.813 --> 37:55.153
I know of him.

37:55.190 --> 37:57.360
He’s gonna take Wild Society
into the next century?

37:57.400 --> 38:00.490
Assuming he still wants
to honor his pledge.

38:01.905 --> 38:03.995
That’s why Reddington
gave us this case?

38:04.032 --> 38:05.372
So we’d clean house
at some charity

38:05.408 --> 38:07.198
before he dropped
a big donation?

38:07.243 --> 38:09.543
How’d he even know
the board members were corrupt?

38:09.579 --> 38:11.499
Well, they’re not exactly
master criminals,

38:11.539 --> 38:12.869
and Raymond’s
a thorough vetter.

38:12.916 --> 38:14.206
I mean,
before he hired me,

38:14.250 --> 38:15.580
he called the lady
that cut my hair.

38:15.627 --> 38:17.457
So we’re back to being
Reddington’s errand boys.

38:17.504 --> 38:19.674
At least it was
for a worthy cause.

38:19.714 --> 38:21.264
That should
make us feel good.

38:21.299 --> 38:23.339
Herbie: Yeah, you’re right.
I do feel good.

38:23.384 --> 38:26.724
[ Cellphone vibrates ]

38:26.763 --> 38:28.013
Hey, I was worried.

38:28.056 --> 38:29.426
Sorry
I didn’t call you back.

38:29.474 --> 38:32.024
J-Jill and I were --
were up all night talking.

38:32.060 --> 38:33.980
Did she forgive you?

38:34.020 --> 38:35.520
Well,
she has conditions.

38:35.563 --> 38:38.653
You know, but I would donate
my left kidney for that woman.

38:38.691 --> 38:41.031
After what you put
that kidney through,

38:41.069 --> 38:43.279
I don’t know
who would want it.

38:43.321 --> 38:47.411
Yeah.
Hey, seriously, Don, thank you.

38:47.450 --> 38:48.740
Oh, thank yourself.

38:48.785 --> 38:50.455
You’re the one who did it.
Come on, man.

38:50.495 --> 38:51.795
Without you, I would still be
witting in my car

38:51.830 --> 38:53.000
having a panic attack.

38:53.039 --> 38:56.379
I actually am in my car,
but I’m not panicking.

38:56.417 --> 38:58.037
And --
And that’s all you.

38:58.086 --> 38:59.496
You really helped me.

38:59.546 --> 39:01.206
Well, I’m here for you,
alright?

39:01.256 --> 39:02.916
Anytime.

39:02.966 --> 39:12.886
♪

39:12.934 --> 39:14.644
Are you destroying evidence

39:14.686 --> 39:17.266
or are you getting rid
of your photo albums?

39:17.313 --> 39:18.653
I thought I unearthed

39:18.690 --> 39:21.610
our Honorable Congressman’s
secret shame.

39:21.651 --> 39:29.951
But no, it just seems that
some things are best left alone.

39:29.993 --> 39:32.043
Really?

39:32.078 --> 39:33.578
You surprise me.

39:33.621 --> 39:37.081
Well, not every nut’s
meant to be cracked.

39:37.125 --> 39:39.295
The Brazil nut,
for instance.

39:39.335 --> 39:43.455
People go for the almonds,
the cashews, pistachios,

39:43.506 --> 39:45.466
but look at the bottom
of every bowl

39:45.508 --> 39:50.298
and there lies
the poor Brazil nuts, untouched.

39:50.346 --> 39:53.636
Just like Arthur Hudson.

39:53.683 --> 39:55.313
Will you still think of him
that way

39:55.351 --> 39:57.811
if he’s the reason
your life falls apart?

39:57.854 --> 39:59.364
So what if he is?

39:59.397 --> 40:02.107
Who am I
to hold up my life

40:02.150 --> 40:04.860
and work against his life
and his work?

40:04.903 --> 40:08.453
After what I heard yesterday,
hell, I’d vote for the guy.

40:08.489 --> 40:11.329
Is that why you’re suddenly
giving everything away?

40:11.367 --> 40:13.117
Ah,
so you figured it all out?

40:13.161 --> 40:15.001
Is that it?
Not really.

40:15.038 --> 40:17.418
The Wild Society is
a noble cause, but --

40:17.457 --> 40:21.707
But we lose one species
every hour on earth.

40:21.753 --> 40:26.843
That’s a grim metric
to mark the passage of time.

40:26.883 --> 40:28.763
Then I think about Agnes,

40:28.801 --> 40:31.431
and how much
has she already lost?

40:31.471 --> 40:35.351
You know, what will still
be here when she’s grown?

40:35.391 --> 40:38.981
I’ve done everything I can
to safeguard her future,

40:39.020 --> 40:45.530
but some forces are well beyond
even my considerable control.

40:45.568 --> 40:47.698
So, I’m giving it up
to others.

40:47.737 --> 40:51.527
Perhaps my gift will help
slow the clock down,

40:51.574 --> 40:56.754
so she can enjoy more of
what the world has to offer.

40:56.788 --> 41:00.538
I’m sure that will have
a huge impact,

41:00.583 --> 41:02.883
but last week, you were
selling off your possessions.

41:02.919 --> 41:05.169
Now, you’re donating
half your wealth --

41:05.213 --> 41:06.883
I’ve never been a miser.

41:06.923 --> 41:10.183
Yes, you’ve always been
very generous,

41:10.218 --> 41:13.178
but not like this.

41:13.221 --> 41:14.601
It’s just money, Dembe.

41:14.639 --> 41:16.599
So it doesn’t
mean anything?

41:16.641 --> 41:19.191
You just saw what happens
when people forget

41:19.227 --> 41:21.307
how meaningless
it really is.

41:21.354 --> 41:22.984
You mean
the three Blacklisters?

41:23.022 --> 41:27.742
They had power,
respect, freedom,

41:27.777 --> 41:31.407
and they threw it all away
for one more dollar.

41:31.447 --> 41:34.577
People have to know
when enough is enough.

41:34.617 --> 41:37.287
And if you find yourself
hanging on too tight,

41:37.328 --> 41:41.788
well,
time to let go.

41:41.833 --> 41:44.133
Okay.

41:44.168 --> 41:47.458
But is everything alright?

41:47.505 --> 41:50.165
Everything
is all relative.

41:50.216 --> 41:53.086
And alright is
definitely relative.

41:53.136 --> 41:57.966
Raymond...
Everything is fine, Dembe.

42:00.226 --> 42:01.846
I’m fine.
