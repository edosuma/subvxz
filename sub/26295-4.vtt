Both ends?

Where is it all coming from?

07:21.266 --> 07:23.094
- Likely viral gastroenteritis.

07:23.138 --> 07:25.619

thing, but I've been like this

07:25.662 --> 07:28.143
almost a month,
and it's not even flu season.

07:28.186 --> 07:30.711

08:14.015 --> 08:16.104
Oh, wonderful.

08:33.600 --> 08:36.428
Felt pretty good right after,
but these days

08:36.472 --> 08:39.127
it feels like a bad sneeze
could paralyze me.

08:39.170 --> 08:40.868
- Unfortunately,
as common as back pain is,

08:40.911 --> 08:42.347
there's not a perfect fix.

08:42.391 --> 08:43.740
- Slow, slow.

08:43.784 --> 08:46.264
- Press against my
hand like a gas pedal.

08:46.308 --> 08:47.831
- It hurts.

08:47.875 --> 08:50.094
Stabbing pain.

08:50.138 --> 08:51.531
We have to do the other leg?

08:51.574 --> 08:53.010
It's gonna hurt, too.

10:24.449 --> 10:26.234
They've never been
an issue with the hospital.

10:26.277 --> 10:27.757
- Well, they are with the Feds.

10:27.801 --> 10:30.064
- Unbelievable.
- Yeah, I--look.

10:30.107 --> 10:31.805
You can still get
ahead of this, okay?

10:31.848 --> 10:34.024
You can make it go away.

10:34.068 --> 10:35.591
'Cause from now on,

10:35.635 --> 10:38.594
whatever happens between you
and Ray, pass it on.

10:38.638 --> 10:41.118
Become a CI for the taskforce.
- An informant.

10:41.162 --> 10:42.729
That's crazy.
No way.

10:42.772 --> 10:48.082
- Doc, this is a big case.
High priority, understand?

10:48.125 --> 10:49.866
You don't have
a lot of options.

10:49.910 --> 10:51.912
- Maybe, but I'm...

10:51.955 --> 10:53.000
I'm still not doing it.

10:53.043 --> 10:54.349
- Will, listen to me.

10:54.392 --> 10:56.307
You get jammed up
with the Feds,

10:56.351 --> 10:58.092
it could cost you
your medical license.

10:58.135 --> 10:59.963
- I said no.

11:00.007 --> 11:02.357
- It's the wrong answer.

11:04.489 --> 11:06.666
I'll be in touch.

11:08.842 --> 11:11.583
- Doctor.

11:16.110 --> 11:18.286
- BP's dropping,
down to 90 over 70.

11:18.329 --> 11:20.027
Heart rate's jumped, 130.

11:20.070 --> 11:22.551
- Spleen's abnormal.
Ultrasound.

11:27.904 --> 11:29.471
Spleen is grossly enlarged.

11:29.514 --> 11:30.733
Also, free fluid
in the abdomen.

11:30.777 --> 11:32.082
Wasn't there on intake.

11:32.126 --> 11:33.649
Grab two units
and then let's move.

11:33.693 --> 11:35.782
I need some help!

11:35.825 --> 11:37.566
- She's bleeding internally.
We need to get her

11:37.609 --> 11:38.959
up to surgery now
to control it.

11:39.002 --> 11:41.744
- She'll be okay though,
right?

11:51.885 --> 11:52.320
.

11:52.363 --> 11:54.365
- Doctor Manning.
- Hi.

11:54.409 --> 11:56.193
Linda, your labs came back.

11:56.237 --> 11:59.980
The cold you can't shake,
the bruising and petechiae,

12:00.023 --> 12:01.372
and now your spleen--

12:01.416 --> 12:03.984
they're from
Primary Myelofibrosis.

12:04.027 --> 12:05.812
It's a type of leukemia.

12:05.855 --> 12:07.683
- Oh, my God.

12:07.727 --> 12:08.815
- Leukemia.

12:08.858 --> 12:10.294
That's cancer.

12:10.338 --> 12:12.514
- It is.
There are some medications

12:12.557 --> 12:14.646
that treat the disease,

12:14.690 --> 12:16.648
but the side effects
can be extreme

12:16.692 --> 12:18.302
and the results
are unproven.

12:18.346 --> 12:21.915
There is one treatment
that can offer a cure.

12:21.958 --> 12:24.178
It's a stem cell transplant.

12:25.919 --> 12:29.009
There's a list, right?

12:29.052 --> 12:30.880
I'll be at the bottom.

12:30.924 --> 12:32.447
- No, no.

12:32.490 --> 12:34.928
There are lists for organs
like hearts and lungs.

12:34.971 --> 12:37.017
Because they come
from deceased donors,

12:37.060 --> 12:38.409
there's a limited supply.

12:38.453 --> 12:40.411
But stem cells come
from living donors.

12:40.455 --> 12:42.109
So anyone able to give blood

12:42.152 --> 12:44.633
can likely also
give stem cells.

12:44.676 --> 12:48.332
There are a lot of options.

12:49.507 --> 12:52.641
- See, baby,
we're gonna beat this.

12:52.684 --> 12:53.816
Thank you, Doctor Manning.

12:53.860 --> 12:55.383
- Of course.

12:55.426 --> 12:57.777
I'll call hematology
to get things started, okay?

12:57.820 --> 13:00.257
- Gracias.

13:02.303 --> 13:05.567
- BP's still low,
temp's ticked up, 102.

13:05.610 --> 13:07.743
- And three trips
to the bathroom.

13:07.787 --> 13:09.701
I couldn't even
keep down ice chips.

13:09.745 --> 13:11.878
- I'm sorry.
I wish I had an answer.

13:11.921 --> 13:14.054
All your blood work
was within normal limits.

13:14.097 --> 13:16.534
And the CT did show
a cyst in your ovaries,

13:16.578 --> 13:17.840
but that's not uncommon.

13:17.884 --> 13:20.625
- Yeah, my sister
has the same thing.

13:22.279 --> 13:24.281
- Stiff.

13:25.456 --> 13:26.544
- Off and on.

13:26.588 --> 13:28.459
- Set up for
a lumbar puncture?

13:28.503 --> 13:31.723
For the flu?

13:31.767 --> 13:33.160
- It's possible
that it's evolved

13:33.203 --> 13:35.771
into encephalitis
or meningitis.

13:35.815 --> 13:38.861
- I will never skip
another flu shot, I swear.

13:38.905 --> 13:41.603
- Is there someone
we can call for you?

13:41.646 --> 13:43.431
- No, my girlfriends,
they'll bring drama

13:43.474 --> 13:45.085
I don't need right now.

13:45.128 --> 13:47.348
- Mm-hmm.

13:50.220 --> 13:52.222
What about your sister?

13:52.266 --> 13:55.051
- She and my parents
live out of state.

13:55.965 --> 13:58.838
It's okay,
I've got my podcasts,

13:58.881 --> 14:02.885
and they can actually go
with me into the bathroom.

14:02.929 --> 14:05.061
- They might make
better company, then.

14:08.717 --> 14:11.676
- I see the Valium's helping.

14:11.720 --> 14:14.462
- I'm trying to move around
a little, loosen things up.

14:14.505 --> 14:15.942
Those my CT results?

14:15.985 --> 14:19.293
- Yes, scans show spinal
degeneration and scar tissue

14:19.336 --> 14:21.251
at L3 through L5.

14:21.295 --> 14:24.646
We suspect it's chronic and
not the cause of today's pain.

14:24.689 --> 14:27.649
That's likely structural, so--
- You want an MRI.

14:27.692 --> 14:29.477
Compare it to the scan taken
when I had surgery

14:29.520 --> 14:32.175
two years ago to see
if anything's different.

14:32.219 --> 14:33.960
- Forgot.
You know the drill.

14:34.003 --> 14:37.441
- Yeah, so I know an MRI won't
show anything more than the CT.

14:37.485 --> 14:39.226
You'll give me some
low grade muscle relaxer,

14:39.269 --> 14:40.575
recommend physical therapy,

14:40.618 --> 14:41.663
but those meds
won't do anything

14:41.706 --> 14:43.317
more than a baby aspirin.

14:43.360 --> 14:45.232
And I'm a lawyer, a partner at
Astor, Caldwell and Davis.

14:45.275 --> 14:48.104
I don't have time to lie on
the floor doing pelvic bridges

14:48.148 --> 14:49.932
with some glorified trainer.

14:49.976 --> 14:52.282
So how about you just write me
a script for what will work?

14:52.326 --> 14:53.849
Norco 10-325s,

14:53.893 --> 14:56.983
then we can all get
on with our lives.

14:57.026 --> 14:59.507
- I'll talk to the pharmacy.

15:03.511 --> 15:04.947
- I take it back.

15:04.991 --> 15:07.297
I think Nora's got the edge
over my old coach.

15:07.341 --> 15:09.343
What are you doing?
- Running Nora's name through

15:09.386 --> 15:10.779
the Illinois
prescription database.

15:10.822 --> 15:12.476
See if she's flagged
as a frequent flyer.

15:12.520 --> 15:14.217
- You think she's just trying
to score pills?

15:14.261 --> 15:15.697
Faking her pain?
- Maybe.

15:15.740 --> 15:16.959
Dodging an MRI
and then immediately

15:17.003 --> 15:19.919
pressing for meds
reeks of a con job.

15:19.962 --> 15:21.311
She's not on file.

15:21.355 --> 15:23.270
Still doesn't mean
we're getting the whole story.

15:25.141 --> 15:27.230
- Nora had her back surgery
at East Mercy.

15:27.274 --> 15:28.884
Call over there.
See if she's only

15:28.928 --> 15:30.625
coming to us
because they cut her off.

15:31.887 --> 15:34.716
- Cesar.
- Ricky Glendon, 19.

15:34.759 --> 15:37.588
Hit by a bus.
GCS 5, intubated on scene.

15:37.632 --> 15:39.590
Hypotensive, but no obvious
long bone deformities.

15:39.634 --> 15:41.244
- Belly's hard as a rock.
Maggie?

15:41.288 --> 15:42.376
- I got you.
Baghdad's ready.

15:42.419 --> 15:44.595
- All right, let's get him in.

15:47.729 --> 15:49.513
All right.
On my count.

15:49.557 --> 15:52.516
One, two, three.

15:53.256 --> 15:55.955
Give me the ultrasound.

15:59.567 --> 16:00.872
Fast scan's positive.

16:00.916 --> 16:01.786
There's free fluid
in the belly.

16:01.830 --> 16:03.397
I need to get in there.

16:03.440 --> 16:06.095
We'll do it in the hybrid O.R.
Maggie, decision time.

16:06.139 --> 16:07.227
You on my team or no?

16:07.270 --> 16:08.880
- I'm in.
- Good.

16:08.924 --> 16:10.752
Page anesthesia,
assemble the others,

16:10.795 --> 16:12.188
and prep the hybrid O.R.
for surgery.

16:12.232 --> 16:15.670
- Copy that.
April.

16:15.713 --> 16:17.019
Take over the AD?

16:17.063 --> 16:19.848
- As long as you need.
- All right.

16:20.936 --> 16:22.894
Call me back.

16:22.938 --> 16:25.027
Better yet,
stop by the hospital.

16:28.465 --> 16:31.468
- Uh, yeah, just...
you know Jay and I,

16:31.512 --> 16:33.079
still arguing
over Dad's stuff.

16:33.122 --> 16:36.212
I thought Pat
didn't hold on to anything.

16:36.256 --> 16:40.216
- Yeah, he didn't.
These are old baseball cards.

16:40.260 --> 16:41.652
- Oh.

16:41.696 --> 16:42.958
So what was all that
with Voight this morning?

16:43.002 --> 16:44.525
So secretive.

16:44.568 --> 16:47.615
- Nothing, uh...
he wanted a curbside diagnosis

16:47.658 --> 16:50.270
because he doesn't trust
his own doctor.

16:50.313 --> 16:52.011
He's a pain in the ass.

16:52.054 --> 16:54.665
- He should get
a second opinion for that.

16:54.709 --> 16:57.494
Get it?
Pain...in the ass.

16:57.538 --> 17:00.062
- Oh, yeah.
That's funny.

17:00.106 --> 17:01.933
- Ha. No, it wasn't.

17:01.977 --> 17:03.848
But that's why I love you.

17:03.892 --> 17:06.373
Oh, it's Goodwin.
I gotta go.

17:06.416 --> 17:07.678
I'll see you.

17:14.163 --> 17:16.296
- We get a stem
cell donor for Linda?

17:16.339 --> 17:18.863
- Come in and close the door.

17:21.257 --> 17:22.737
There's a problem.

17:22.780 --> 17:24.826
Linda Harper
isn't a U.S. citizen.

17:24.869 --> 17:28.525
That complicates her ability
to access a transplant network.

17:28.569 --> 17:31.398
Patients can't be denied
based on immigration status.

17:31.441 --> 17:35.054
- No, but they can if they're
unable to prove they have

17:35.097 --> 17:37.534
stable insurance
to cover the procedure

17:37.578 --> 17:38.796
and the follow-up cost.

17:38.840 --> 17:40.102
- But she has insurance.

17:40.146 --> 17:42.322
James, her husband,
is a citizen

17:42.365 --> 17:45.151
and covered by Medicaid.
Doesn't that include Linda?

17:45.194 --> 17:48.023
- The marriage allows Linda
to apply for a green card,

17:48.067 --> 17:50.895
but until she has
official legal status,

17:50.939 --> 17:53.811
James' Medicaid
does not extend to her.

17:53.855 --> 17:55.465
- This is ridiculous.

17:55.509 --> 17:58.816
So despite the abundance
of stem cell donors out there,

17:58.860 --> 18:01.689
Linda can't get to any of them
because of red tape?

18:01.732 --> 18:03.865
Ms. Goodwin, a transplant
is the only treatment

18:03.908 --> 18:05.127
that can save her life.

18:05.171 --> 18:06.694
- I know.

18:06.737 --> 18:09.784
That's why I think the family
should bypass the network

18:09.827 --> 18:12.308
altogether
with a direct donation

18:12.352 --> 18:13.831
from her brother, Manny.

18:15.703 --> 18:16.921
- It's expensive, I know.

18:16.965 --> 18:19.707
But there's not
a better option.

18:22.188 --> 18:23.189
- I'll speak with James.

18:23.232 --> 18:24.625
- All right.

18:24.668 --> 18:26.757
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

18:27.715 --> 18:31.066
- When this is tied,

18:31.110 --> 18:33.329
the mesentery
will be hemostatic.

18:42.425 --> 18:45.080
- Marty, talk to me.
- Massive ST elevations.

18:45.124 --> 18:46.864
- Kid's 19
and he's having a heart attack?

18:46.908 --> 18:48.692
- Apparently.
- We need an angiogram.

18:48.736 --> 18:50.564
Let's get the C-arm in place.
Maggie?

18:50.607 --> 18:52.305
- Introducer kit,
wire and lead.

18:52.348 --> 18:54.872
- Read my mind.
Let's go.

18:54.916 --> 18:57.745
- So, your LP revealed
a high presence of white cells

18:57.788 --> 18:59.268
in your cerebral spinal fluid.

18:59.312 --> 19:01.705
- So it is encephalitis
or meningitis.

19:01.749 --> 19:03.272
- Yes and no.
The search for

19:03.316 --> 19:06.275
the infecting bacteria
or virus was inconclusive.

19:06.319 --> 19:08.886
You have the symptoms,
but not the cause.

19:08.930 --> 19:11.193
That's strange, isn't it?

19:11.237 --> 19:13.021
- Tara, you're slurring.

19:13.064 --> 19:16.111
- My face feels weird.
Tingly.

19:16.155 --> 19:18.592
- Ptosis of the left eyelid.
It's really droopy.

19:18.635 --> 19:20.594
Left corner of
the mouth is lagging.

19:20.637 --> 19:22.291
Seventh cranial nerve issue?

19:22.335 --> 19:24.250
- Mm-hmm.

19:24.293 --> 19:25.686
Does your mouth feel dry?

19:25.729 --> 19:27.775
- Tastes like metal.

19:27.818 --> 19:29.080
- These new signs--
whatever is going on,

19:29.124 --> 19:30.908
it is definitely
affecting her brain.

19:30.952 --> 19:32.780
- Let's get an MRI and push her
to the front of the list.

19:32.823 --> 19:33.868
Squeeze my fingers.

19:35.913 --> 19:38.655
- We're gonna find out.

19:38.699 --> 19:40.744
Order a transvaginal
ultrasound as well.

19:40.788 --> 19:42.833
Why?

19:42.877 --> 19:44.313
We already saw them on the CT.

19:44.357 --> 19:46.707
- Yeah, well,
I want a better look.

19:46.750 --> 19:48.230
- Okay.

19:48.274 --> 19:50.406
- I understand it's
an enormous amount of money.

19:50.450 --> 19:51.755
- I don't care.

19:51.799 --> 19:54.193
We'll take out loans,
sell the car.

19:54.236 --> 19:55.585
It's Linda's life.

19:55.629 --> 19:57.370
- And in all honesty,
this is the hardest part.

19:57.413 --> 19:59.502
The medicine itself
is straightforward.

19:59.546 --> 20:02.636
Manny, as Linda's brother,
you are the ideal candidate

20:02.679 --> 20:03.767
to donate your stem cells.

20:03.811 --> 20:05.247
It's a series of infusions

20:05.291 --> 20:07.467

Scan only shows
simple ovarian cysts.

Nothing abnormal. Are you
going to fill me in on why

23:29.582 --> 23:31.235
you doubled back to look
at the cysts?

23:31.279 --> 23:33.107
- I thought one
might have been a teratoma.

23:33.150 --> 23:34.717
- A clump of cells
that shouldn't be there.

23:34.761 --> 23:36.502
- Well, it would explain
the sharpness she feels

23:36.545 --> 23:38.721
in her abdomen,
and if the teratoma

23:38.765 --> 23:40.375
contains primitive
brain cells...

23:40.419 --> 23:42.464
could have tricked
her immune system

23:42.508 --> 23:43.639

her actual brain cells.

23:43.683 --> 23:45.467

neurologic symptoms.

23:45.511 --> 23:48.078
Okay, yeah,
I see the connections,

23:48.122 --> 23:50.037
but the kind of teratoma
that you're describing

23:50.080 --> 23:51.342
is super rare.
- Yes.

23:51.386 --> 23:53.127
But a teratoma
is the only thing

23:53.170 --> 23:54.607
that connects all her
symptoms.

23:54.650 --> 23:56.130

show up on the ultrasound?

23:56.173 --> 23:57.566

23:57.610 --> 23:59.046
But just because
a radiologist couldn't see it

23:59.089 --> 24:00.743
does not mean
it's not there.

24:00.787 --> 24:04.443
Dr. Halstead, there
are cysts in each ovary.
