00:00.650 --> 00:02.550
previously  on "one tree hill"...

00:02.550 --> 00:04.410
I'm having your baby.lucas scott.

00:04.490 --> 00:05.620
I love you.

00:07.180 --> 00:08.630
I just want to run some tests.

00:08.740 --> 00:12.090
I thought I was in charge of the school
paper and had final say on what went in it.

00:12.210 --> 00:12.910
You do.

00:13.010 --> 00:15.470
And i have final say on
whether or not you work here.

00:15.550 --> 00:17.060
That was the charleston chiefs.

00:17.130 --> 00:18.710
You're looking at their
newest point guard.

00:20.330 --> 00:21.710
I had sex last night.

00:21.770 --> 00:22.770
It was a mistake.

00:22.890 --> 00:24.450
It was supposed to be you.

00:24.550 --> 00:25.340
I know.

00:25.440 --> 00:29.160
Brooke says she needs a buyer
in new york for costumes.

00:29.290 --> 00:30.680
Maybe I should go.

00:30.790 --> 00:32.580
I think that might be best.

00:32.650 --> 00:33.800
What's that.grandpa?

00:33.880 --> 00:36.670
That's the thing that makes noise
when it's time for me to get better.

00:36.750 --> 00:38.400
I want you to have this.

00:38.510 --> 00:40.770
It means we're going steady.

00:42.270 --> 00:48.000
This is so wrong... but it'S...so right.

00:55.170 --> 00:56.270
You need to go.

00:56.330 --> 00:57.280
Why?What did I do?

00:57.400 --> 00:58.890
You know what you did.

00:58.980 --> 01:00.080
Most girls like that.

01:00.140 --> 01:01.800
Well.not me.

01:02.900 --> 01:04.239
I'm gonna  shoke awer.

01:04.349 --> 01:05.650
and when I get out.I want you gone.

01:05.690 --> 01:07.500
I don't understand why
it's such a big deal.

01:07.610 --> 01:10.020
Because I don't do that!

01:10.920 --> 01:13.460
I'm a mother.for god's sakes.

01:14.770 --> 01:17.360
Look.brooke.I'm sorry.It
won't happen again. Okay?

01:17.410 --> 01:19.190
Really. I promise.

01:22.580 --> 01:23.520
You promise?

01:23.590 --> 01:24.490
I promise

01:25.150 --> 01:27.680
Okay.you caught me a little off guard there.

01:27.750 --> 01:29.690
Understandable.I'm sorry.

01:30.670 --> 01:32.170
I'm sorry I freaked out.

01:32.740 --> 01:34.430
Just as long as it doesn't happen again.

01:34.510 --> 01:38.800
You have my word.Never again
will I say the words "I love you.

01:39.320 --> 01:42.710
" Even though I do.in fact.love you.

01:43.110 --> 01:45.110
love you.I love you.love you.

01:45.150 --> 01:46.670

02:01.960 --> 02:03.730
What are you doing here?

02:04.120 --> 02:06.620
Picking up the rest
of my stuff.I'm sorry.

02:06.720 --> 02:09.039
I talked to skills.He said
you'd be at work all day.

02:09.990 --> 02:11.500
Fat'sunny.

02:11.620 --> 02:14.560
Skills told me to be here all
day to wait for the cable guy.

02:15.120 --> 02:17.800
Now I'm thinking he
just unplugged the cable.

02:21.270 --> 02:22.870
so.how's new york?

02:23.210 --> 02:24.560
It's nice.

02:24.650 --> 02:27.100
I missed it.It's a really
exciting place to be.

02:27.330 --> 02:28.810
That's good.

02:29.370 --> 02:31.770
You know.things have been
pretty exciting in tree hill.

02:32.060 --> 02:34.350
People are losing their minds
over this movie business.

02:34.500 --> 02:36.580
And.u I met the guy who's playing me.

02:36.740 --> 02:38.480
It's totally weird.

02:40.680 --> 02:42.630
I could have sent that to you.

02:42.750 --> 02:45.120
I came to get my
car.I'm driving it back.

02:46.240 --> 02:48.870
I thought the whole point of new
york was that you didn't need a car.

02:49.130 --> 02:52.500
Yeah.but I've decided to stay
on a more permanent basis.

02:56.170 --> 02:59.780
So...I guess this is
goodbye for a while.then.

03:00.610 --> 03:02.780
Actually. it's goodbye forever.

03:16.890 --> 03:18.280
hello?

03:19.100 --> 03:20.760
Anybody home?

03:21.570 --> 03:23.410
Geez!Haley.

03:23.480 --> 03:24.990
Sorry.I'm really sorry.

03:25.070 --> 03:26.480
You know bad hearts run in my family.

03:26.570 --> 03:29.000
I know.It's a good thing I know cpr.

03:30.630 --> 03:31.930
What is this?

03:32.010 --> 03:35.240
You send me a cryptic text telling me
to meet you at this strange address.

03:35.330 --> 03:36.590
What have you been doing in crleston?

03:36.680 --> 03:39.380
What do you think?Have we
ever spent this day apart?

03:39.450 --> 03:40.610
No.

03:40.660 --> 03:42.070
Come on.

03:42.230 --> 03:43.880
You couldn't come home this weekend.

03:43.920 --> 03:47.150
so I just decided to bring home to you.

03:51.120 --> 03:53.370
Happy anniversary.nathan scott.

04:00.040 --> 04:02.710
Since it's just you and me tonight.

04:02.770 --> 04:08.630
I am going to let you stay up past
bedtime and watch "thomas & friends.

04:09.800 --> 04:11.340
" I'd rather watch "gossip girl.

04:11.400 --> 04:13.160
" It's so bad for me.

04:13.970 --> 04:16.790
Keep dreaming.Okay.you're
pretty good at math.

04:16.839 --> 04:19.550
so I'm guessing orval is
joining us again for dinner.

04:19.589 --> 04:21.930
If he even touches my pepperoni.

04:21.980 --> 04:24.390
I will kick his imaginary butt.

04:24.430 --> 04:25.400
Easy.nanny deb.

04:25.480 --> 04:26.910
It's not for orval.

04:29.100 --> 04:30.810
That was fast.The pizza's here.

04:37.050 --> 04:38.350
hello.deb.

04:38.440 --> 04:40.120
You're looking...old.

04:42.330 --> 04:43.810
Grandpa dan!

04:45.000 --> 04:46.730
There's my guy.

04:49.750 --> 04:51.400
What do you want.dan?

04:51.500 --> 04:53.000
I invited him.

04:58.880 --> 05:01.880
don't you know there's a rule
about letting pregnant women lie?

05:01.950 --> 05:04.000
Is that "lie" as in
"sleep" or "lie" as in.

05:04.040 --> 05:05.170
"ocourse you're the baby's father"?

05:05.250 --> 05:08.030
no.It's "lie" as in
"sleep." but that.too.

05:08.220 --> 05:11.680
You know.you're gonna feel really bad
about that when you see my surprise.

05:11.750 --> 05:12.950
really?

05:13.040 --> 05:16.900
Has the surprise anything to do with the
reason you didn't come to bed last night?

05:17.230 --> 05:18.450
Maybe.

05:18.500 --> 05:20.820
You ready to have your world rocked?

05:21.070 --> 05:22.910
Not so much.

05:23.170 --> 05:24.760
you got morning sickness again.

05:24.840 --> 05:26.100
Yeah.sure.

05:31.780 --> 05:33.760
You okay?

05:36.120 --> 05:37.860
**********

05:54.180 --> 05:55.740
let's get you to bed.

05:55.890 --> 05:58.090
The doctor said you
need to take it easy.

05:58.910 --> 06:01.130
I want to see the surprise.

06:01.290 --> 06:03.000
It's not a good idea.

06:03.060 --> 06:04.620
I want to see it.

06:09.040 --> 06:11.100
Peyton...

06:23.000 --> 06:25.170
like you said.this is our house now.

06:26.740 --> 06:28.800
It's beautiful.

06:48.950 --> 06:51.710
- Peyton...
- I'm just gonna need a minute.

07:14.150 --> 07:16.420
We haven't even picked out names yet.

07:18.500 --> 07:20.310
I was thinking "anna.

07:21.760 --> 07:24.450
" "Anna" for a little girl.after my mom.

07:25.080 --> 07:26.340
Come on.

07:26.430 --> 07:28.500
- Don'T.
- Or maybe.

07:29.410 --> 07:31.950
um... maybe "sawyer" for
a boy -- sawyer scott.

07:32.420 --> 07:36.720
We need to take a couple
days and process this.okay?

07:39.180 --> 07:42.370
When I think about all the time I
thought maybe I didn't want a baby

07:42.740 --> 07:45.420
-- like I -- like I
couldn't handle it...

07:46.660 --> 07:48.670
peyton.it doesn't work like that.

07:48.810 --> 07:51.640
The universe doesn't
punish you for being afraid.

07:52.610 --> 07:55.860
I know.I know.

08:00.020 --> 08:01.470
But I can't do it.

08:02.470 --> 08:05.000
- Listen.the doctor
-- I know what he said.

08:05.780 --> 08:10.270
If you have this baby... you could die.

08:12.890 --> 08:14.740
It doesn't matter.

08:16.930 --> 08:19.180
I'm gonna have this baby.

08:41.500 --> 08:44.120
The doctor didn't say
something could happen to you.

08:46.230 --> 08:48.340
He said there was a very good chance.

08:50.680 --> 08:53.300
Peyton.he said we could
lose the baby anyway.

09:01.900 --> 09:04.390
Look.we... we don't have to
make this decision now.okay?

09:04.460 --> 09:08.180
We can...take a couple
days before we go back in.

09:08.230 --> 09:09.660
Okay?

09:09.860 --> 09:11.840
For an abortion.

09:13.360 --> 09:15.450
That is not what the doctor called it.

09:15.510 --> 09:16.620
That's what it is.

09:16.670 --> 09:19.840
- Look.nobody is gonna
say -- that's what it is!

09:21.780 --> 09:24.950
Okay.If you would like to talk about it.

09:25.050 --> 09:27.230
then call it what it is.

09:29.310 --> 09:31.690
How could this happen in a month?

09:33.630 --> 09:37.730
I had some pain early in the pregnancy.

09:38.830 --> 09:40.750
Why didn't you tell me that?

09:41.790 --> 09:43.010
'Cause I didn't want you to worry.

09:43.070 --> 09:45.050
and they said it was nothing.

09:45.100 --> 09:46.640
This isn't nothing.

09:46.720 --> 09:48.110
Maybe it is.

09:48.180 --> 09:49.950
What does that mean?

09:50.030 --> 09:51.670
Well.it means whatever happens.happens.

09:51.750 --> 09:54.390
That is really selfish.you know that?

09:55.520 --> 09:56.340
Excuse me?

09:56.430 --> 09:58.630
Okay.fine!You want
me to be the bad guy?!

09:58.690 --> 10:00.620
Fine.We'll call it what you want.

10:00.660 --> 10:06.760
But if continuing this pregnancy
means I lose you... then we end it.

10:07.970 --> 10:09.840
it's not an "it.

10:09.940 --> 10:12.360
" Luke.this is our baby.

10:12.420 --> 10:14.100
all right?You -- you
saw its heartbeat.

10:14.150 --> 10:16.390
You saw its little.tiny
fingers and its toes.

10:16.450 --> 10:17.740
- Stop it!Stop it!
- No.I'm not gonna stop it!

10:17.810 --> 10:19.970
I want you to think about it.okay?

10:20.150 --> 10:21.290
Well.then.we'll try again.okay?

10:21.350 --> 10:25.040
Okay?We can adopt.okay?

10:25.130 --> 10:26.900
I mean.if your parents
never would have adopted.

10:26.930 --> 10:28.080
we never would have met.

10:28.170 --> 10:30.960
I know.I know.honey.And
I love you for that.

10:31.340 --> 10:34.600
But this little life
inside of me -- it's you.

10:34.660 --> 10:35.810
and it's me.

10:35.890 --> 10:37.820
And I want him to
have your goofy squint.

10:37.890 --> 10:39.770
and I want her to have my chickeny legs.

10:39.850 --> 10:43.070
I don't need this kid to look like me.

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
I don't care about that.

10:46.830 --> 10:49.340
I care...about this child
growing up without a mother.

10:51.950 --> 10:54.190
Look what it did to you.

10:55.600 --> 10:58.900
You are really trying
to guilt me into this.

10:59.080 --> 11:01.440
Hell yes.I am.

11:01.620 --> 11:03.500
That is exactly what I'm gonna do if.

11:03.580 --> 11:06.430
in the end.it keeps you alive.

11:08.180 --> 11:10.000
You are such a dick.

11:10.130 --> 11:11.930
Well. then.fine.I'm a dick.

11:20.840 --> 11:22.460
What are you doing?

11:22.520 --> 11:24.400
It was too soon.

11:24.510 --> 11:25.580
Stop it!

11:25.700 --> 11:27.630
Lucas eugene scott.if you
don't stop it right now.

11:27.710 --> 11:29.540
I will beat your ass!

11:30.210 --> 11:32.120
You sound like a mom.

11:32.420 --> 11:34.290
I am a mom.

11:37.900 --> 11:42.400
A while back.I had a dream...
that something happened to you.

11:44.650 --> 11:47.870
It got me to thinking
about my life witht you.

11:47.950 --> 11:51.310
- and I-I
can'T...- honey.

11:51.400 --> 11:54.420
No. I can't live that life.I can'T.

11:55.600 --> 11:58.240
You talk about how
I'm always saving you.

11:58.300 --> 12:00.150
peyton.and I can't save you from this.

12:00.230 --> 12:02.220
We can't even think like that.okay?

12:02.340 --> 12:06.580
Will you just please look at all the
stuff you and I have survived together?

12:06.610 --> 12:10.450
I mean.car crashes and
bullet wounds And psychos.

12:11.650 --> 12:15.580
Are we really gonna let
some doctor lay odds on us?

12:18.000 --> 12:19.280
And.okay.

12:19.980 --> 12:22.330
Even if something  does happen to me.

12:22.420 --> 12:24.040
you're gonna be okay.

12:24.080 --> 12:26.940
And you can raise this baby on your own.

12:27.350 --> 12:29.330
just like your mom did.

12:29.780 --> 12:33.090
And how am I supposed to feel about
the child that took you away from me?

12:33.150 --> 12:35.110
God.I don't worry
about that for a second.

12:35.170 --> 12:37.520
because you are not that person.

12:38.110 --> 12:41.440
And you will never.ever.ever
be on your own.

12:41.880 --> 12:45.910
You have nathan and haley and...brooke.

12:49.290 --> 12:54.690
And just think about all that sexy jake
jagielski single-dad tail you're gonna rake in.

12:54.940 --> 12:56.200
Funnnot Y.

12:56.280 --> 12:58.570
I'm sorry.It's not funny.

12:58.630 --> 13:03.110
Because I would haunt your ass just
to make sure you never had sex again.

13:03.180 --> 13:05.430
How can you joke about this?

13:06.830 --> 13:08.710
'Cause I'm scared.

13:10.120 --> 13:11.830
Ttaught me to believe in fate.

13:11.900 --> 13:13.790
I mean.that's what "the
comet" is all about.right?

13:13.850 --> 13:15.640
It's about accepting your fate.

13:17.920 --> 13:20.230
How can this be fate?

13:22.240 --> 13:23.910
Maybe it is.

13:23.990 --> 13:29.900
Maybe... Maybe the
whole point of you and me

13:30.330 --> 13:33.110
and every single moment
that we've shared together

13:33.820 --> 13:35.740
has just been leading us here.

13:36.540 --> 13:40.230
Maybe you and I are
meant to create this life.

13:40.360 --> 13:43.700
because maybe this life
is gonna change the world.

13:43.980 --> 13:48.430
I can't accept that our story
doesn't have a good ending.

13:48.640 --> 13:52.100
Our story already has
the greatest ending.

13:52.220 --> 13:53.830
no matter what.

13:54.940 --> 13:56.630
'Cause we're together.

14:03.020 --> 14:05.390
I need to know we're
making the right choice.

14:05.520 --> 14:08.280
I just... What?

14:09.740 --> 14:11.560
Okay.c-c-come -- come
here.Sit down.Sit down.

14:11.790 --> 14:13.180
I'll call an ambulance.

14:13.260 --> 14:18.850
No.Wait.He's kicking hard.

14:20.820 --> 14:22.720
Do you feel that?!

14:24.480 --> 14:26.120
Yeah.

14:33.190 --> 14:35.950
It is okay for you to love this baby.

14:36.160 --> 14:38.490
It doesn't mean you don't love me.

14:41.800 --> 14:43.630
I can't live without you.peyton.

14:43.850 --> 14:45.130
honey.you don't have to.

14:45.210 --> 14:46.800
and you're not going to.

14:46.870 --> 14:48.830
I know it.I can feel it.

14:49.480 --> 14:51.990
We are gonna live happily ever after.

14:56.070 --> 14:57.670
all three of us.

15:04.500 --> 15:07.710
******

15:12.710 --> 15:14.250
Millicent.wait.

15:14.770 --> 15:16.220
Wait for what.marvin?

15:16.300 --> 15:18.280
What else is there to say after goodbye?

15:18.370 --> 15:20.240
You're not wearing your glasses.

15:20.310 --> 15:21.900
I had lasik.

15:21.960 --> 15:23.900
I see 20/20 now.

15:23.930 --> 15:26.120
Well. I guess it was a month of firsts.

15:26.610 --> 15:29.440
Okay. If you're done making fun of me.

15:29.500 --> 15:31.560
- I have a long drive.
- Hang on.That was mean.

15:31.650 --> 15:33.980
I-I was angry.

15:34.180 --> 15:35.820
Maybe I still am a little.

15:35.850 --> 15:39.820
Trust me -- there's nothing you can say that
I haven't said to myself a thousand times.

15:39.850 --> 15:41.880
Well.maybe there's one thing.

15:43.640 --> 15:45.620
I'm sorry.

15:46.500 --> 15:48.670
What are you sorry for?

15:48.740 --> 15:50.910
For driving you away.

15:56.050 --> 15:58.150
It's my cellphone bill.

15:59.210 --> 16:00.670
It's $300.

16:00.760 --> 16:02.260
Text-messaging fees.

16:02.320 --> 16:04.490
Most of those were texts from gigi.

16:04.590 --> 16:06.630
and a lot of them were my replies.

16:06.730 --> 16:08.280
Why are you doing this?

16:08.340 --> 16:09.400
It's cruel.

16:09.490 --> 16:11.900
I'm not trying to be cruel.millie.

16:11.980 --> 16:14.860
I'm doing this because you're
the one who deserves to be angry.

16:15.090 --> 16:17.230
and you need to know that
you didn't screw this up.

16:17.300 --> 16:19.040
I did.

16:19.130 --> 16:23.260
And I didn't even really realize how wrong it
was until I saw it there in black and white.

16:24.540 --> 16:26.410
Why did you do it?

16:27.930 --> 16:29.850
I don't
know.Maybe I --

16:30.360 --> 16:31.890
maybe I got some kind of rush out of it.

16:31.950 --> 16:35.140
I can't give you a reason that
won't sound like an excuse.

16:35.420 --> 16:36.830
But if I'd never gone down that road.

16:36.900 --> 16:40.360
then you never would have... you know.

16:42.210 --> 16:47.820
So before you walk out of my life...
I need to know if you can forgive me.

16:48.180 --> 16:51.640
That's really
noble.marvin.but you're a guy.

16:51.680 --> 16:53.330
You have needs.

16:53.370 --> 16:56.050
Gigi made you feel special in
a way that I obviously couldn'T.

16:56.090 --> 16:57.620
That is not true.

16:57.680 --> 17:00.300
You made me feel
special every single day.

17:00.870 --> 17:02.850
But never at night.

17:05.050 --> 17:07.520
All those nights we
slept beside each other.

17:07.589 --> 17:13.170
there were so many times I'd lie awake watching you sleep
and I'd just want to rip your clothes off and attack you.

17:14.000 --> 17:15.589
Why didn't you?

17:15.680 --> 17:18.270
I was scared...

17:18.520 --> 17:22.510
that what we had was so special
that sex would mess it up.

17:23.040 --> 17:25.990
That the promise of it could
never live up to the real thing.

17:27.270 --> 17:30.350
But now I realize that our
relationship wasn't that special.

17:30.520 --> 17:34.780
Don't .Y that we were
amazing together.millie.

17:35.510 --> 17:38.950
And...I know we can be
amazing together again.

17:39.480 --> 17:42.310
The mistakes we made will
always be there between us.

17:43.780 --> 17:49.880
But maybe if we start over... maybe the past
won't be there in our next relationships.

17:50.250 --> 17:53.170
So the mistakes go away.but
we're with the wrong people.

17:53.220 --> 17:55.490
We can't just go back to
being mouth and millie.

17:55.530 --> 17:59.250
I don't want to go back.I want to go
forward -- being this version of us.

17:59.310 --> 18:00.900
What do you mean?

18:01.010 --> 18:03.430
I mean.things were always
so easy between us before.

18:03.480 --> 18:05.290
but this is real life.

18:05.380 --> 18:07.800
Yes.we made mistakes.We screwed up.

18:07.960 --> 18:11.420
Maybe we can be that couple that finds
our way through it to something better --

18:11.730 --> 18:14.290
something we both know is worth
fighting for and protecting.

18:14.370 --> 18:16.350
I-I don't have all the answers.

18:16.420 --> 18:20.900
millie.I just... I know that I miss you.

18:22.330 --> 18:24.150
What do you miss about me?

18:24.210 --> 18:26.960
I miss knowing that my day
was gonna start with you.

18:27.330 --> 18:30.990
knowing that I was gonna come home
to the one person who really got me.

18:32.140 --> 18:34.900
I miss the fact that
around 2:30 every morning.

18:34.980 --> 18:37.470
you snore for exactly seven minutes.

18:39.690 --> 18:41.260
I do not.

18:41.550 --> 18:46.580
And I miss... I miss the glasses.

18:47.340 --> 18:50.500
The glasses aren't coming back.marvin.

18:50.990 --> 18:53.870
I can't rewind the clock
and take any of it back.

18:53.940 --> 18:55.910
I know that.

18:56.090 --> 18:58.920
But I didn't love you for your glasses.

18:59.140 --> 19:01.110
I love you for you.

19:02.390 --> 19:04.700
I love you.too. marvin.

19:05.900 --> 19:08.830
But it's not just
about you forgiving me.

19:09.510 --> 19:10.890
I have to forgive  myself.

19:10.950 --> 19:14.110
and I can't do that if
I'm seeing you every day.

19:18.760 --> 19:20.580
I have to go.

19:22.270 --> 19:24.060
Or you could stay.

19:33.580 --> 19:35.380
I'm sorry.

19:48.900 --> 19:52.800
******

19:55.930 --> 19:57.160
to seven years.

19:57.260 --> 19:59.440
Seven years.

20:00.440 --> 20:03.890
I can't believe you talked me
into marrying you when I was 16.

20:03.960 --> 20:05.270
I know.What the hell was I thinking?

20:05.290 --> 20:07.050
That's like jamie bringing
home a wife in 10 years.

20:07.150 --> 20:08.150
Stop it.

20:08.220 --> 20:09.430
That is  so not gonna happen.

20:09.500 --> 20:11.530
We'd totally be hypocrites.

20:11.590 --> 20:13.430
That's true.

20:14.300 --> 20:15.310
Where is the boy.anyway?

20:15.350 --> 20:17.360
your mom's watching him for the night.

20:17.800 --> 20:20.240
And who's gonna watch him when we
do a dime for breaking and entering?

20:20.290 --> 20:21.630
Don't be such a wuss.

20:21.690 --> 20:22.960
I've got everything figured out.

20:23.060 --> 20:24.400
Time for fortune cookies.

20:24.510 --> 20:26.220
Okay. Okay.

20:33.830 --> 20:35.810
"You are a master of your craft.

20:35.930 --> 20:37.900
" In bed.Now.that is true.

20:37.980 --> 20:39.560
It does not say that.

20:39.630 --> 20:42.070
No.but you can add "in bed"
to the end of any fortune.

20:42.170 --> 20:43.260
and it works.

20:43.390 --> 20:44.780
- What?
- It works every time.

20:44.830 --> 20:47.120
Try it.Try it.

20:47.920 --> 20:49.920
Where do you come up with these things?

20:50.790 --> 20:53.530
"Prepare yourself for a big change.

20:53.570 --> 20:55.610
" In bed.Well.

20:55.750 --> 20:58.240
you know what they say
about the seven-year itch.

20:58.300 --> 21:00.030
Fortune cookies suck.

21:00.830 --> 21:02.830
It got the "change" part right.

21:03.580 --> 21:07.140
I know the last couple weeks have been
hard on you -- taking care of jamie.

21:07.200 --> 21:08.440
working full time.

21:08.640 --> 21:11.100
yeah.that's kind of what I meant.

21:11.130 --> 21:14.090
Um... listen.

21:14.190 --> 21:20.320
Uh... I haven't exactly
been working full time.

21:20.820 --> 21:22.400
What?Why not?

21:22.470 --> 21:24.330
It's just like.uh.you know.

21:24.360 --> 21:28.300
I consider it a vacation -- an
unpaid one that may never end.

21:28.360 --> 21:30.560
Haley.what the hell happened?

21:30.830 --> 21:33.840
You know that paper I told you
about thatam wrote for school?

21:33.940 --> 21:38.090
- Yeah.- It was incredible and
important and maybe a little pg-13.

21:38.150 --> 21:41.750
and principal rimkus told me I
couldn't publish it in the school paper.

21:42.120 --> 21:43.720
So.of course.you did.

21:44.510 --> 21:46.060
Yeah.

21:46.240 --> 21:47.640
Are you mad?

21:47.720 --> 21:49.890
Yeah -- at
principal buttkiss.

21:50.280 --> 21:52.970
- That's very original.
- Thank you.

21:53.070 --> 21:55.880
Anyway.she suspended me.

21:55.960 --> 21:58.540
so... but it got me thinking.

21:58.580 --> 22:02.770
you know.about where we're headed
and just the bigger picture.

22:03.330 --> 22:05.010
And?

22:05.350 --> 22:10.400
Well.for instance...what do you
think if jamie and I come here?

22:11.190 --> 22:13.300
You want to move to charleston?

22:13.370 --> 22:15.510
I know.It's totally crazy.right?

22:15.570 --> 22:16.950
But.on the other hand.

22:17.010 --> 22:20.040
you're gonna be spending a lot more
time here than you will be in tree hill.

22:20.120 --> 22:21.930
Next you're gonna tell me that
we already bought this house.

22:21.960 --> 22:24.100
No.

22:24.170 --> 22:26.730
But the realtor is a friend of a
friend.in case we wanted to check it out.

22:26.800 --> 22:28.980
You are just full of surprises tonight.

22:29.050 --> 22:30.910
I'm just getting started.

22:34.690 --> 22:37.530
This place is practically falling
apart.It must be dirt-cheap.

22:37.620 --> 22:39.920
I think it's beautiful.

22:40.050 --> 22:43.220
It kind of reminds me of the old
granville house in "it's a wonderful life.

22:43.570 --> 22:47.810
" You know -- the one george and mary
used to throw rocks at and make wishes.

22:48.120 --> 22:50.600
See?Isn't this perfect?

22:50.860 --> 22:52.040
Jamie would love it.

22:52.140 --> 22:54.110
Chester would love it.

22:54.180 --> 22:56.950
I'm sure this place comes with
things that could eat chester.

22:57.500 --> 22:59.030
Come on.

23:04.850 --> 23:07.690
This could be my music studio!

23:07.820 --> 23:13.180
and... it happens to overlook the
driveway with a basketball hoop.

23:14.050 --> 23:15.390
So whenever I need inspiration.

23:15.470 --> 23:17.740
I can watch you
play -- shirtless.

23:17.820 --> 23:19.840
I mean.you just got this
all figured out.don't you?

23:19.950 --> 23:22.610
Well.I'm just dreamG.

23:22.830 --> 23:25.550
Baby.tree hill's always
gonna be our home.

23:25.610 --> 23:26.920
And I don't want to leave forever.

23:27.010 --> 23:28.520
But.at the same time.

23:28.570 --> 23:30.730
we never said we'd stay forever.

23:31.000 --> 23:32.520
Okay.

23:33.040 --> 23:34.980
You want to dream.

23:36.480 --> 23:38.990
Let's dream big.

23:39.100 --> 23:40.310
You should get back to your music.

23:40.410 --> 23:43.060
but I'm not talking about
writing songs in some creaky.

23:43.150 --> 23:44.630
old house.

23:44.770 --> 23:46.600
You should get back on the road.

23:47.030 --> 23:49.950
Yeah.like that's ever gonna happen.

23:50.110 --> 23:53.780
I saw that look in your
eyes after that U.S.O. Show.

23:53.880 --> 23:55.790
You get the same rush
from the crowd that i do.

23:55.870 --> 23:57.850
And one attention whore
per family is enough.

23:57.910 --> 23:59.340
don't you think?

23:59.470 --> 24:01.150
We could make it work.

24:02.160 --> 24:03.650
Like we did last time?

24:03.720 --> 24:06.630
We are not the same couple we
were then.We're much stronger now.

24:06.710 --> 24:08.920
We also have a child to think about.

24:09.000 --> 24:10.290
He has school.

24:10.390 --> 24:13.040
It's a good thing his mom is
the world's greatest teacher.

24:13.110 --> 24:15.710
whose speciality is tutoring scott boys.

24:16.010 --> 24:17.020
I don't know.baby.

24:17.130 --> 24:20.120
A different city every night?

24:20.170 --> 24:21.900
Living out of a bus?

24:21.970 --> 24:23.910
What kind of a life
would that be for him?

24:23.980 --> 24:26.400
It's the kind of life
most kids dream of.

24:27.270 --> 24:29.810
I'll tell you what.Come here.

24:30.120 --> 24:34.830
Pretend like we're outside right
now throwing rocks at this house.

24:35.050 --> 24:38.280
You tell me your wish
wouldn't be to go back on tour.

24:39.820 --> 24:41.490
It would.

24:41.590 --> 24:43.080
I knew it.

24:43.150 --> 24:44.070
Nathan.

24:44.170 --> 24:45.920
we would have totally separate lives.

24:46.040 --> 24:48.140
What would that mean for us?

24:48.270 --> 24:49.640
Phone sex.

24:49.740 --> 24:51.460
I'm serious.

24:51.550 --> 24:54.950
This is our marriage.You can't take
those kind of chances with marriage.

24:55.320 --> 24:57.370
You got to play defense.

24:57.550 --> 24:59.050
do you know who you're talking to?

24:59.110 --> 25:00.920
Have you seen my defensive stats?

25:01.920 --> 25:03.300
Look.

25:03.360 --> 25:06.040
there's only a couple of things
that I'm certain of in life.

25:06.150 --> 25:07.780
and one of them is that.

25:07.880 --> 25:09.320
no matter what happens.

25:09.390 --> 25:11.950
you're gonna be the one
wheeling me around when I'm 80.

25:13.880 --> 25:15.640
Besides.I just...

25:15.970 --> 25:20.590
I couldn't live with myself knowing that
my dream kept you from pursuing yours.

25:21.560 --> 25:23.240
you're so amazing.

25:23.990 --> 25:26.200
I know.You got lucky.

25:27.480 --> 25:28.980
Think about it.will you?

25:29.670 --> 25:31.630
Yeah.I'll think about it.

25:32.450 --> 25:36.010
Besides.what do you want
with an old house like this?

25:36.200 --> 25:38.030
There's too many rooms.

25:38.370 --> 25:41.700
You forgot how much fun we're gonna
have filling them up with kids.

25:41.790 --> 25:43.590
really?

25:43.760 --> 25:46.200
- All these rooms?
- All of them.It's a big house.

25:51.870 --> 25:53.760
*********

26:07.020 --> 26:09.900
apparently.you missed the
part about me wanting you gone.

26:10.680 --> 26:11.950
What are you still doing here?

26:12.050 --> 26:14.170
I didn't know you dated ryan reynolds.

26:14.240 --> 26:15.560
What are you talking about?

26:15.630 --> 26:16.800
Where did you get that?

26:16.920 --> 26:18.960
This website.It's
called whosdatedwho.Com.

26:19.050 --> 26:20.620
It lists everyone you've
dated for the past five years.

26:20.670 --> 26:22.520
They can't do that!

26:22.580 --> 26:26.060
You're a public figure.The rules
of common decency don't apply.

26:26.130 --> 26:28.820
But this is all wrong.I never dated him.

26:28.890 --> 26:30.910
I never even  thim.

26:31.250 --> 26:32.520
Well.yeah.I would have dated her.

26:32.580 --> 26:33.730
but no.

26:33.840 --> 26:36.260
Colin farrell.Nice.

26:36.580 --> 26:38.850
Remind me to get tested.

26:39.030 --> 26:40.960
Very funny.

26:41.060 --> 26:43.580
You can't believe everything
you read on the internet.

26:43.670 --> 26:45.190
Yeah.but even if you
can believe half of it.

26:45.240 --> 26:47.740
the sheer
volume -- wow.

26:47.930 --> 26:49.210
Okay.

26:52.570 --> 26:53.840
Playtime's over.

26:53.920 --> 26:56.300
Six hours of battery life.sweetheart.

26:56.370 --> 26:58.290
Why are you doing this?

26:58.370 --> 27:01.820
Because I'm trying to figure out why
you got so freaked out about what I said.

27:01.900 --> 27:04.430
By examining my ex list?

27:04.510 --> 27:07.740
So I dated a few guys
in new york.So what?

27:07.740 --> 27:09.450
You weren't in love with any of them?

27:10.430 --> 27:13.010
I didn't have time for love.okay?

27:13.070 --> 27:15.780
And even if I had.victoria
would have never allowed it.

27:15.830 --> 27:17.740
So there it is.

27:17.810 --> 27:22.320
So.then.the last time
you were in love...

27:23.630 --> 27:24.980
now I get it.

27:25.060 --> 27:28.340
Yeah.It was a long time ago.

27:30.560 --> 27:31.330
Ere are you going?

27:31.380 --> 27:33.440
If you have more than
one copy of lucas' book.

27:33.480 --> 27:34.460
I'm out of here.

27:34.590 --> 27:37.600
Look.I'm sorry if it's weird for you.

27:38.680 --> 27:40.680
You still love him?

27:41.430 --> 27:44.530
- No.I don'T.
-  Yeah.

27:44.620 --> 27:46.760
That's what peyton said.

27:47.370 --> 27:48.570
First of all.

27:48.620 --> 27:51.910
peyton fed me that story long
before she told it to you.

27:51.970 --> 27:53.010
so I've been there.

27:53.140 --> 27:56.200
And.second.I love
her.but I'm not peyton.

27:56.310 --> 27:58.210
I'm sorry.It's just that I've
already been in a relationship

27:58.310 --> 28:01.030
that had the stench of
lucas scott hanging over it.

28:01.060 --> 28:03.300
And how do you think  i feel?

28:03.350 --> 28:09.130
I'm the girl who's dating the guy who came
to town in the first place to get peyton back.

28:09.200 --> 28:10.770
Okay.not exactly true.

28:10.850 --> 28:12.610
but...point taken.

28:12.680 --> 28:13.820
Yeah.

28:13.890 --> 28:17.650
It sucks always being the footnote
in someone else's love story.

28:20.730 --> 28:22.890
But you're right.you
know.You're not peyton.

28:23.320 --> 28:28.000
Lucas and peyton's story is all
about romance and destiny and fate.

28:28.540 --> 28:30.210
But you're different.

28:30.320 --> 28:32.610
Um...thanks?

28:32.690 --> 28:33.990
Brooke davis writes her own story.

28:34.060 --> 28:37.940
like you did with your career
and your company and with sam.

28:38.970 --> 28:40.950
You choose your own path.

28:42.460 --> 28:44.020
Yeah.

28:44.550 --> 28:47.120
But you can't choose who you love.

28:47.660 --> 28:50.500
You're right.You don'T.

28:50.830 --> 28:54.410
But you choose whether or not
you open your heart to love.

28:56.560 --> 28:58.890
What do you want me to say?

29:00.200 --> 29:03.730
How about."I love you.too.julian"?

29:05.620 --> 29:09.790
How about."I like you a lot"?

29:11.330 --> 29:13.670
This is all happening really fast.

29:13.720 --> 29:15.240
What happened to just having fun?

29:15.290 --> 29:16.990
And. you know.it's not as simple for me.

29:17.030 --> 29:18.360
I have sam to think about.

29:18.430 --> 29:19.150
- Don't do that.
- What?

29:19.300 --> 29:20.530
Don't hide behind sam.

29:20.560 --> 29:22.860
- I'm not hiding.
- Yes.you are.

29:22.990 --> 29:24.700
And you want to know what I think?

29:24.760 --> 29:30.460
I think you do love me -- or you could love me --
but you're just too stubborn and scared to admit it.

29:30.540 --> 29:32.790
because the last time you really
gave your heart to someone.

29:32.820 --> 29:34.900
it got broken.

29:35.060 --> 29:36.590
And I get that.

29:36.620 --> 29:38.130
I've been there.

29:38.190 --> 29:39.360
But somewhere along the line.

29:39.400 --> 29:43.140
you gave up on the idea that you
deserve to feel this way again.

29:45.680 --> 29:48.350
But you don't see what i see.brooke.

29:49.700 --> 29:51.880
You deserve this.

29:52.100 --> 29:54.770
So I'm gonna try one more time.

29:56.080 --> 29:58.270
I love you.

29:59.110 --> 30:01.440
I'm in love with you.

30:01.910 --> 30:05.020
I'm so lost and completely
in love with you.

30:05.100 --> 30:09.570
I have been ever since I saw you doing
that ridiculous molly ringwald dance.

30:13.300 --> 30:15.870
Julian...

30:16.340 --> 30:23.790
I... I care about you so much.

30:28.380 --> 30:31.470
Never let it be said
that brooke davis is easy.

30:32.750 --> 30:34.640
Julian.

30:35.400 --> 30:36.800
I'm sorry.

30:36.890 --> 30:38.690
That wasn't fair.

30:43.080 --> 30:44.310
You know what?

30:44.380 --> 30:49.170
It's okay.Someday you'll let
someone in.Today's just not that day.

30:51.640 --> 30:53.810
I don't want this to change anything.

30:54.950 --> 30:58.590
No. it won'T.It won'T.

30:58.730 --> 31:00.070
You know.you were right.It's my fault.

31:00.120 --> 31:01.480
We were just having fun.

31:01.670 --> 31:06.590
and I just -- you
overwhelmed me a little bit.

31:07.590 --> 31:09.510
It's too soon.

31:10.890 --> 31:13.470
It is a little too soon.

31:13.570 --> 31:15.520
Yeah.I know.

31:18.890 --> 31:21.860
I'll tell you what -- why don't
you go get ready for dinner?

31:21.930 --> 31:24.350
We'll pretend the last
hour never happened.

31:26.130 --> 31:28.120
Are you sure?

31:29.470 --> 31:33.140
I mean... can we really do that?

31:34.020 --> 31:35.990
Yeah.

31:36.070 --> 31:38.120
In fact.in the movie
business.we do it all the time.

31:38.230 --> 31:40.470
It's called a deleted scene.

31:43.140 --> 31:46.260
Go pull yourself together.brooke
davis.You look a mess.

31:49.010 --> 31:51.230
I'll wait for you.

31:53.320 --> 31:55.140
Okay.

32:12.550 --> 32:15.430
**********

32:20.550 --> 32:22.610
Can I have some ice cream now?

32:23.250 --> 32:26.760
It's okay with me if it's
okay with your...granny deb.

32:28.300 --> 32:29.620
One scoop.

32:29.700 --> 32:31.330
Yes!

32:36.980 --> 32:38.470
He's a good kid.

32:38.600 --> 32:40.080
He's a great kid.

32:40.700 --> 32:44.400
Who.unfortunately.drank
the dan scott kool-aid.

32:45.390 --> 32:47.020
As soon as he's asleep.

32:47.080 --> 32:48.700
you're gone.

32:51.380 --> 32:55.020
How about the comic stylings
of the good dr.Seuss?

32:55.370 --> 32:57.940
How about a story about
daddy when he was little?

32:58.270 --> 33:00.100
You want a story about your dad?

33:00.210 --> 33:01.360
Okay.

33:01.460 --> 33:02.780
Let's see.

33:02.880 --> 33:04.900
There was this one time we
all went down to disney world.

33:04.940 --> 33:07.180
That was when your dad was
even younger than you are.

33:07.330 --> 33:08.870
And we were at the petting zoo.

33:08.950 --> 33:12.790
and I wanted to take a picture of
your dad petting this big brown goat.

33:12.860 --> 33:16.600
when this bratty kid walks up and
whacks the goat with a big stick.

33:16.650 --> 33:20.220
That's when the goat hip-checks your
dad 10 feet across the petting zoo.

33:21.050 --> 33:22.800
He didn't even know what hit him.

33:23.470 --> 33:24.460
Grandpa.

33:24.560 --> 33:27.250
why'd you and nanny
deb stop being married?

33:30.630 --> 33:35.120
Well.j-man... Life's like a long race.

33:35.270 --> 33:37.790
And some couples were meant
to go the whole distance.

33:37.860 --> 33:40.830
and some were only meant to go halfway.

33:41.470 --> 33:43.650
Do you still love each other?

33:48.040 --> 33:50.720
Time for you to hit the hay.

33:52.010 --> 33:53.380
What about mommy and daddy?

33:53.430 --> 33:55.910
Will they ever stop being married?

33:57.910 --> 33:59.710
If there's one thing I know.

33:59.780 --> 34:03.460
it's that your mom and dad are gonna
make it all the way to the finish line.

34:07.050 --> 34:10.510
- I love you.buddy.
- I love you.grandpa.

34:24.210 --> 34:26.230
Well the boy's out.

34:26.510 --> 34:28.380
I guess the same goes for me.

34:29.219 --> 34:31.360
I remember that trip to disney world.

34:32.469 --> 34:35.710
The only ride nathan would go on
was the tram to the parking garage.

34:37.179 --> 34:39.360
So the two of you spent
the whole day on it.

34:39.440 --> 34:41.480
talking basketball.

34:41.830 --> 34:43.620
Yeah.

34:48.179 --> 34:50.409
That was a great day.

34:51.020 --> 34:55.090
We drove 600 miles to ride on a bus.

34:56.159 --> 34:58.310
- Still a great day.
- Yeah.

35:01.770 --> 35:04.130
We were supposed to be  this couple.

35:05.190 --> 35:07.620
tucking our grandkids in together.

35:13.780 --> 35:16.650
Nobody sets out to have
a failed marriage.deb.

35:17.010 --> 35:19.150
It ends with a million little mistakes.

35:24.280 --> 35:28.530
And a couple  really big ones.

35:29.480 --> 35:34.820
Whenever I think the man I fell in love
with is still inside there somewhere...

35:35.830 --> 35:38.760
I remember that you
stood in that hallway.

35:39.080 --> 35:42.000
looked your brother in the eye.

35:42.180 --> 35:44.920
and pulled the trigger.

35:46.950 --> 35:48.590
I've done my time.deb.

35:48.640 --> 35:50.700
It'll never be enough.

35:50.760 --> 35:53.680
Keith won't get any time back.

35:54.110 --> 35:56.100
You want to talk about keith?

35:57.260 --> 35:58.940
Let's talk about keith.

35:59.230 --> 36:00.980
You're right.

36:01.530 --> 36:07.480
In a single moment of hatred... I
made the greatest mistake of my life.

36:08.570 --> 36:12.330
But I did it because I
thought I was getting revenge.

36:12.690 --> 36:14.100
Okay.

36:14.190 --> 36:15.460
It's time for you to go.

36:15.500 --> 36:16.620
No.no.no.Not yet.

36:16.670 --> 36:18.160
I thought I was getting revenge.

36:18.190 --> 36:22.880
'cause I thought keith had poisoned that bottle
of scotch and left me there to burn to death.

36:24.010 --> 36:25.810
But it wasn't keith.

36:25.860 --> 36:27.580
was it.deb?

36:27.810 --> 36:29.020
I-I-I don't want
to hear this.

36:29.160 --> 36:30.930
It was you.wasn't it?!

36:30.990 --> 36:32.750
You want to walk down
memory lane tonight?

36:32.830 --> 36:38.420
I thought the reason keith was trying to kill
me was 'cause I hired jules  sleep with him.

36:38.460 --> 36:41.320
And the reason I did that was 'cause.in
one of the worst moments of my life.

36:41.380 --> 36:46.940
I walked in on my wife cheating
on me with my own brother!

36:47.540 --> 36:55.200
From the way I see it... I pulled
the trigger... but you loaded the gun.

36:56.270 --> 37:00.660
I've done my time.deb.Have you?

37:02.490 --> 37:08.620
You don't think I've thought about
that every day for the past five years?

37:08.690 --> 37:11.520
How I left karen without keith.

37:11.600 --> 37:14.310
lily without a father.

37:14.490 --> 37:16.970
And that's whyI  ha you.

37:17.030 --> 37:18.500
I hate you for killing keith.

37:18.590 --> 37:22.340
and I hate you for the guilt I feel!

37:22.610 --> 37:25.490
It's good that you're
gonna die soon.dan.

37:25.660 --> 37:28.680
It makes me believe in justice.

37:29.620 --> 37:32.390
Now get the hell out.

37:32.570 --> 37:34.950
Grandpa?

37:35.120 --> 37:38.140
It's time for you to get better.

37:57.250 --> 37:59.650
this house is starting to grow on me.

37:59.790 --> 38:03.240
it's been a great anniversary.

38:03.310 --> 38:05.250
But you did all this for me.

38:05.740 --> 38:07.030
and I didn't give you anything.

38:07.100 --> 38:09.540
That is not exactly true.

38:09.600 --> 38:11.910
You've given me an amazing life so far.

38:13.730 --> 38:18.900
Who knows?Maybe someday when my body's
completely wrecked and your singing days are over.

38:19.420 --> 38:23.100
we can come back here
and...grow old together.

38:24.170 --> 38:25.930
What do you say?

38:27.170 --> 38:29.620
Yes!I say yes!

38:30.560 --> 38:32.220
Happy anniversary.haley james scott.

38:32.320 --> 38:35.560
George bailey.I'll love
you till the day I die.

39:28.590 --> 39:31.610
Okay. I think I've
gotten pretty presentable.

39:31.670 --> 39:32.900
Yeah.okay.

39:32.940 --> 39:34.750
Right.Yeah.I'll be right there.

39:34.940 --> 39:35.850
Who's that?

39:35.970 --> 39:38.620
It was the production office.Apparently
one of the locations fell through.

39:38.640 --> 39:40.450
I got to go down and figure it out.

39:40.540 --> 39:42.590
Tonight?

39:43.320 --> 39:45.460
Do you want me to go with you?

39:45.550 --> 39:47.380
No.It'll probably take a while.

39:47.660 --> 39:49.060
Okay.

39:49.140 --> 39:52.870
Well... come over when you're done.

39:53.030 --> 39:55.570
We can still have dessert.
