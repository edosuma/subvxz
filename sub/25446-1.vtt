all patient records‐‐hello?

11:46.138 --> 11:50.012
When John came up
with antiviral software,

11:50.012 --> 11:54.020
90 % of the people
that were running computers

11:54.020 --> 11:56.692
<i>weren't even aware of viruses.</i>

11:56.692 --> 11:58.696
And then viruses started
getting names.

11:58.696 --> 12:00.000
<i>It's called Michelangelo.</i>

12:00.000 --> 12:01.034
<i>It's called Michelangelo.</i>

12:01.034 --> 12:03.172
It's a lowdown work
of sabotage

12:03.172 --> 12:05.677
that could wreck millions
of computer programs

12:05.677 --> 12:07.146
around the world.

12:07.146 --> 12:08.950
What is a computer virus?

12:08.950 --> 12:10.352
A computer virus, Bryant,

12:10.352 --> 12:12.490
is a program
written by a hacker.

12:12.490 --> 12:14.962
Any computer that it's in,
it activates

12:14.962 --> 12:17.668
and destroys all of the data
in those systems.

12:17.668 --> 12:20.874
John showed his first
signs of savvy,

12:20.874 --> 12:23.345
working with the media.

12:23.345 --> 12:27.053
<i>Able to articulate</i>
<i>a scary story.</i>

12:27.053 --> 12:29.324
This doomsday virus
was about to hit.

12:31.495 --> 12:33.332
The entire research
community agrees,

12:33.332 --> 12:34.835
this is the number one virus.

12:34.835 --> 12:36.539
It is the number one
computer threat.

12:36.539 --> 12:38.142
It's real,
and it's going to happen

12:38.142 --> 12:40.179
on the 6th of March.

12:40.179 --> 12:43.185
<i>The Michelangelo Virus</i>
<i>caused many people</i>

12:43.185 --> 12:45.389
<i>around the world</i>
<i>to download</i>

12:45.389 --> 12:49.097
<i>antivirus software</i>
<i>for the first time.</i>

12:49.097 --> 12:52.370
<i>That's how the money</i>
<i>just started rolling in.</i>

12:52.370 --> 12:55.777
By 1993, McAfee controlled

12:55.777 --> 12:59.518
67 % of the desktop
antivirus market.

13:01.923 --> 13:04.695
<i>They only had about</i>
<i>20 employees.</i>

13:04.695 --> 13:06.832
Do not stand in doorways.
Stand against‐‐

13:06.832 --> 13:09.538
<i>But there were already,</i>
<i>like, $14 million in revenue.</i>

13:09.538 --> 13:12.744
<i>‐ They were printing money.</i>
‐ Excuse me.

13:12.744 --> 13:15.750
It still was a group
of John's original friends

13:15.750 --> 13:17.888
and family that worked there.

13:17.888 --> 13:20.560
<i>A lot of them didn't have</i>
<i>careers before.</i>

13:20.560 --> 13:23.098
Excuse me.
Gretzky, Tech Support.

13:23.098 --> 13:25.670
John had more, like,
a cult style.

13:25.670 --> 13:29.912
And people would not go home
for two and three days.

13:29.912 --> 13:30.000
They would sleep
under their desk

13:30.000 --> 13:32.049
They would sleep
under their desk

13:32.049 --> 13:35.055
to make sure John was happy
with the work they were doing.

13:35.055 --> 13:37.794
Okay, what you need to do
in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file‐‐

13:37.794 --> 13:40.800
<i>It was a crazy culture,</i>
<i>that's for sure.</i>

13:40.800 --> 13:43.706
<i>Three of the women</i>
<i>were supposedly witches,</i>

13:43.706 --> 13:45.543
<i>and they would sit</i>
<i>in the conference room</i>

13:45.543 --> 13:48.148
<i>and have, like,</i>
<i>a little chant.</i>

13:48.148 --> 13:52.390
Andrea Nation would come in
in the morning

13:52.390 --> 13:54.260
with a bottle of Windex

13:54.260 --> 13:57.968
and clean off
Bill Larson's desk.

13:57.968 --> 14:00.000
Because there was
a sex contest going on.

14:00.000 --> 14:00.172
Because there was
a sex contest going on.

14:00.172 --> 14:01.408
You'd get points.

14:01.408 --> 14:04.180
They had a group called
Little Foxes,

14:04.180 --> 14:07.854
where they, um,
would give points

14:07.854 --> 14:10.426
for, uh, having sex

14:10.426 --> 14:13.633
in different spots
of the office.

14:13.633 --> 14:16.706
<i>John being this free spirit,</i>

14:16.706 --> 14:20.747
<i>that made the culture</i>
<i>of the company.</i>

14:20.747 --> 14:24.287
He wasn't the typical
suit and tie guy.

14:26.992 --> 14:28.930
<i>The investors wanted</i>
<i>to take the company</i>

14:28.930 --> 14:30.000
<i>to the next level.</i>

14:30.000 --> 14:30.633
<i>To the next level.</i>

14:30.633 --> 14:33.940
<i>And that was definitely not</i>
<i>John's forte.</i>

14:33.940 --> 14:35.844
<i>They felt like John</i>
<i>couldn't do that</i>

14:35.844 --> 14:38.683
<i>and I think that John</i>
<i>didn't want to do it, either.</i>

14:38.683 --> 14:39.685
They bought John out.

14:39.685 --> 14:41.321
They bought his shares out.

14:45.964 --> 14:48.603
He sensed the virus threat

14:48.603 --> 14:51.976
in a way
that most people didn't.

14:51.976 --> 14:56.151
<i>He seemed brilliant</i>
<i>but also paranoid.</i>

14:56.151 --> 14:59.691
He is more sensitive

14:59.691 --> 15:00.000
than, maybe,
the average person

15:00.000 --> 15:01.695
than, maybe,
the average person

15:01.695 --> 15:03.131
to potential threats.

15:03.131 --> 15:04.768
My wife thought it
a little funny

15:04.768 --> 15:06.639
when he came next door,
looking for his wife Judy,

15:06.639 --> 15:08.141
who was over visiting
with us,

15:08.141 --> 15:09.678
'cause he wasn't home yet.

15:09.678 --> 15:11.114
And he shows up,
and he‐‐and so,

15:11.114 --> 15:12.283
I let him in the house
and he's got

15:12.283 --> 15:14.655
a gun in his back pocket.

15:14.655 --> 15:17.493
And I says‐‐
Susan said,

15:17.493 --> 15:19.497
you know, uh,
"Is that a gun in your pocket,

15:19.497 --> 15:20.767
or are you just happy
to see me?"

15:20.767 --> 15:22.203
You know?

15:22.203 --> 15:24.373
And, you know, he just,
"Oh, well, you know,

15:24.373 --> 15:26.679
it's dark out, there's no street
lights on this street.

15:26.679 --> 15:28.883
You never know."

15:28.883 --> 15:30.000
But they were making
quite a bit of money then.

15:30.000 --> 15:30.653
But they were making
quite a bit of money then.

15:30.653 --> 15:33.124
And maybe somebody
kidnapped his wife.

15:33.124 --> 15:35.997
So he came over to see
if we'd seen her.

15:35.997 --> 15:37.399
Is that paranoid?

15:37.399 --> 15:38.836
I don't know.

and came back
with a 12‐gauge shotgun,

01:02:07.909 --> 01:02:10.514
cycled the shotgun,

what you don't know

01:08:51.816 --> 01:08:53.752
‐ about this murder?
‐ <i>If I am detained,</i>

01:08:53.752 --> 01:08:55.991
<i>this is where people</i>
<i>just simply disappear.</i>

01:08:55.991 --> 01:08:58.328
<i>They choke on their own vomit</i>
<i>or hang themselves</i>

<i>Or are beaten to death</i>
<i>by fellow prisoners.</i>

01:09:00.432 --> 01:09:02.069
<i>John sent me a text</i>
<i>and said,</i>

01:09:02.069 --> 01:09:03.907
<i>"We have to move."</i>

01:09:03.907 --> 01:09:06.946
<i>And I went to take out money</i>
<i>from John's account.</i>

01:09:06.946 --> 01:09:08.883
$2,000.

01:09:08.883 --> 01:09:13.559
And I took it where he was
hiding at the boat place.

01:09:13.559 --> 01:09:15.964
<i>Two days after</i>
<i>the Greg Faull thing,</i>

01:09:15.964 --> 01:09:18.870
John calls me and says,
"I need you to keep me safe

01:09:18.870 --> 01:09:21.207
and get me
out of the country alive."

01:09:21.207 --> 01:09:26.216
<i>♪♪♪</i>

01:09:49.865 --> 01:09:53.404
We went to, like,
a Chinese place,

01:09:53.404 --> 01:09:55.309

painting his hair

01:09:55.309 --> 01:09:57.914
<i>and that's where</i>
<i>Tom took us.</i>

01:10:00.553 --> 01:10:02.390

01:10:15.784 --> 01:10:18.455
<i>'cause he said he wanted</i>

01:10:18.455 --> 01:10:21.461
his side of the story

01:10:21.461 --> 01:10:22.798
The search to find John McAfee

01:10:22.798 --> 01:10:24.300
began right here
at the airport,

01:10:24.300 --> 01:10:26.471
not long after I landed.

01:10:26.471 --> 01:10:28.008
And it began
with three simple words.

01:10:28.008 --> 01:10:29.210
"Sorry, I'm late."

01:10:29.210 --> 01:10:30.000
A prearranged code word
to let me know

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:31.014
A prearranged code word
to let me know

01:10:31.014 --> 01:10:33.218
I'd met the person who would
take me to McAfee.

01:10:35.690 --> 01:10:37.794
<i>And so we get in this cab</i>

01:10:37.794 --> 01:10:41.969
and take off on just a crazy
drive through Belize City.

01:10:47.179 --> 01:10:49.016
<i>It was like a bad movie.</i>

01:10:49.016 --> 01:10:51.856
<i>We were doing, you know,</i>
<i>switchbacks and turnarounds</i>

01:10:51.856 --> 01:10:54.026
and then it's like,
"Get out! Get out!"

01:10:54.026 --> 01:10:56.164
And then we‐‐he's like,
"No, get in there!"

01:10:56.164 --> 01:10:59.403
And it's another cab we get in.

01:10:59.403 --> 01:11:00.000
<i>It's not the Belize you see</i>
<i>in the travel pictures.</i>

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:01.709
<i>It's not the Belize you see</i>

01:11:01.709 --> 01:11:03.779
<i>You know, this is not</i>

01:11:03.779 --> 01:11:07.019
<i>And then eventually,</i>
<i>we stop in the parking lot</i>

01:11:07.019 --> 01:11:10.325
<i>of a really</i>
<i>low‐rent looking hotel.</i>

01:11:10.325 --> 01:11:12.463
When we finally got
to John McAfee,

01:11:12.463 --> 01:11:15.068
he's wearing
an outlandish disguise.

01:11:15.068 --> 01:11:17.507
Kind of like an old man
with a crippled arm,

01:11:17.507 --> 01:11:20.412
powder in his hair
to make himself look old.

01:11:20.412 --> 01:11:21.982
And he's walking with a cane.

01:11:21.982 --> 01:11:24.487
John McAfee
is coming towards us.

01:11:24.487 --> 01:11:25.723
Only it wasn't John McAfee.

01:11:25.723 --> 01:11:27.527
It was John McAfee in really‐‐

01:11:27.527 --> 01:11:30.000
in a really bad disguise.

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:30.900
In a really bad disguise.

01:11:30.900 --> 01:11:34.373
<i>We all knew</i>
<i>it was John McAfee.</i>

01:11:34.373 --> 01:11:37.346
<i>But your problem is that you</i>
<i>really wanna talk to him,</i>

01:11:37.346 --> 01:11:38.883
<i>and I'm afraid that if I say,</i>

01:11:38.883 --> 01:11:40.920
"Hey John, how you doing?"

01:11:40.920 --> 01:11:43.358
He's going to explode
and‐‐and storm off,

01:11:43.358 --> 01:11:46.932
and our opportunity
to interview him would be lost.

01:11:46.932 --> 01:11:49.103
So we did what we thought
was the prudent thing to do,

01:11:49.103 --> 01:11:52.978
and that was ignore him.

01:11:52.978 --> 01:11:55.415
<i>We get up to his hotel room.</i>

01:11:55.415 --> 01:11:58.121
<i>And 20 seconds later,</i>
<i>he bursts into the room.</i>

01:11:58.121 --> 01:12:00.000
And the shawl he had over his
shoulders, he flings off.

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:00.760
And the shawl he had over his
shoulders, he flings off.

01:12:00.760 --> 01:12:04.233
And he shakes his hair
of all this powder.

01:12:04.233 --> 01:12:06.404
"Fooled you, didn't I?"

01:12:06.404 --> 01:12:09.010
And, of course,
you're like, "Yeah.

01:12:09.010 --> 01:12:10.747
You sure did."

01:12:10.747 --> 01:12:13.218
<i>And then, there we were.</i>

01:12:13.218 --> 01:12:14.855
<i>Face to face.</i>

01:12:14.855 --> 01:12:17.393
Did you kill Greg Faull?

01:12:17.393 --> 01:12:19.698
I barely knew the man.
And why would I kill him?

01:12:19.698 --> 01:12:22.202
He was a neighbor that lived
200 yards down the beach.

01:12:22.202 --> 01:12:24.307
Do you really believe
that this is a vendetta

01:12:24.307 --> 01:12:26.444
by the government of Belize

01:12:26.444 --> 01:12:29.283
‐ to take you down and kill you?
‐ Absolutely, sir.

01:12:29.283 --> 01:12:30.000
You're sincerely concerned
that if you somehow wind up

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:32.824
You're sincerely concerned
that if you somehow wind up

01:12:32.824 --> 01:12:34.327

to assassinate you?

01:12:34.327 --> 01:12:36.064

01:12:37.834 --> 01:12:39.503
<i>Absolutely, I do, sir.</i>

01:12:39.503 --> 01:12:41.441
<i>It was all about McAfee.</i>

01:12:41.441 --> 01:12:43.011
<i>Everything that we've ever seen</i>

01:12:43.011 --> 01:12:45.583
was McAfee, McAfee, McAfee,

01:12:45.583 --> 01:12:47.252
who murdered
an American businessman.

01:12:47.252 --> 01:12:49.457
McAfee who did this,
McAfee who did that.

01:12:49.457 --> 01:12:52.697
But there wasn't very much,

01:12:52.697 --> 01:12:55.803
uh, publicity for my son.

01:12:55.803 --> 01:12:59.511
McAfee found a way
to keep the attention on him.

01:13:01.214 --> 01:13:04.153
<i>We have a President,</i>
<i>a Prime Minister,</i>

01:13:04.153 --> 01:13:06.290
you have the Mayor of San Pedro,

01:13:06.290 --> 01:13:09.263
the Minister of Tourism,

01:13:09.263 --> 01:13:10.733
all giving interviews

01:13:10.733 --> 01:13:12.804
about a man who's just
bat‐shit crazy.

01:13:12.804 --> 01:13:13.939
Well, I've never met the man.

01:13:13.939 --> 01:13:16.144
Don't know what
he looks like.

01:13:16.144 --> 01:13:18.816
Uh, I don't want
to be unkind,

01:13:18.816 --> 01:13:22.256
but it strikes me
that he's extremely paranoid.

01:13:22.256 --> 01:13:24.661
In fact, I would go so far
as to say bonkers.

01:13:31.307 --> 01:13:34.447
<i>By then, everybody know</i>
<i>who is John McAfee.</i>

01:13:34.447 --> 01:13:36.952
I couldn't hide him no more.

01:13:36.952 --> 01:13:39.558
<i>So we drove</i>
<i>to the southernmost border</i>

01:13:39.558 --> 01:13:41.227

<i>It's 200 miles south</i>
<i>of Belize City.</i>

01:13:44.801 --> 01:13:47.507

01:13:47.507 --> 01:13:50.212
<i>in the time we knew each other.</i>

01:13:50.212 --> 01:13:52.182
He knew I could get him out.

01:13:55.890 --> 01:13:57.594
<i>So how did you</i>
<i>get him out of the country?</i>

01:13:57.594 --> 01:13:59.230
I‐‐we just put him on a boat

01:13:59.230 --> 01:14:00.000
and dump him on land
in Guatemala.

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:01.067
And dump him on land
in Guatemala.

01:14:01.067 --> 01:14:04.941
We didn't‐‐no customs,
no immigration, no nothing.

01:14:04.941 --> 01:14:06.277
That's illegal.

01:14:09.818 --> 01:14:13.324
<i>I told him I could've gotten</i>
<i>his passport legally stamped</i>

01:14:13.324 --> 01:14:17.667
<i>in a place called</i>
<i>Puerto Barrios.</i>

01:14:17.667 --> 01:14:20.640
But once he knew he was
getting out in a boat,

01:14:20.640 --> 01:14:23.177
he took complete control.

01:14:23.177 --> 01:14:24.881
He's John again.

01:14:24.881 --> 01:14:27.219
He does what he wants to do.

01:14:27.219 --> 01:14:30.000
All my advice to him never

All my advice to him never

01:14:31.027 --> 01:14:34.266
He's John McAfee now.

01:14:34.266 --> 01:14:36.538

<i>from an immigration</i>
<i>detention center.</i>

01:17:21.066 --> 01:17:24.006
<i>They took me to</i>
<i>the hospital at three o'clock,</i>

01:17:24.006 --> 01:17:26.410
<i>when I knew the appeal</i>
<i>had been filed.</i>

01:17:26.410 --> 01:17:29.049
<i>I said, "I feel better.</i>
<i>I wanna go back to prison,</i>

01:17:29.049 --> 01:17:30.000
<i>to my cell, thank you."</i>

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:30.986
<i>To my cell, thank you."</i>

01:17:30.986 --> 01:17:33.825
<i>And that's what they did.</i>

01:17:33.825 --> 01:17:36.598
<i>And an appeal meant</i>
<i>that it would be</i>

01:17:36.598 --> 01:17:40.071
<i>15 years before they could</i>
<i>deport me back to Belize.</i>

01:17:40.071 --> 01:17:43.679
<i>Well, it was not in Guatemala's</i>
<i>interest to keep me in prison</i>

01:17:43.679 --> 01:17:46.083
<i>for that many years,</i>
<i>so I was deported</i>

01:17:46.083 --> 01:17:48.922
<i>to the States,</i>
<i>which is what I wanted.</i>

01:17:48.922 --> 01:17:52.530
This afternoon, he boarded
a flight back to Florida.

01:17:52.530 --> 01:17:55.234
<i>Amid a media frenzy,</i>
<i>Guatemalan police</i>

01:17:55.234 --> 01:17:57.606
<i>forced him aboard</i>
<i>a U. S.‐bound flight.</i>

01:18:03.417 --> 01:18:05.288
<i>Software developer</i>
<i>John McAfee</i>

01:18:05.288 --> 01:18:06.992
has returned
to the United States.

01:18:06.992 --> 01:18:08.829
<i>The software pioneer</i>
<i>is still wanted</i>

01:18:08.829 --> 01:18:11.000
<i>for questioning in the murder</i>
<i>of an American citizen</i>

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:12.870
<i>in Belize,</i>
<i>but he's free for now.</i>

01:18:12.870 --> 01:18:14.540
And at the moment,
he's still not charged

01:18:14.540 --> 01:18:16.176
with any crime.

01:18:18.749 --> 01:18:22.455
I cannot help but feel
that he enjoyed,

01:18:22.455 --> 01:18:25.596
in his mind, playing the role
of kind of a puppet master.

01:18:25.596 --> 01:18:26.731
He had a plan,

01:18:26.731 --> 01:18:29.570
and he was orchestrating
that plan.

01:18:29.570 --> 01:18:30.000
What's a better story?

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:30.806
What's a better story?

01:18:30.806 --> 01:18:33.110
Millionaire mad man
on the run.

01:18:33.110 --> 01:18:34.647
But you saved my.
Why?

01:18:34.647 --> 01:18:37.152
'Cause you paid attention
to the story.

01:18:37.152 --> 01:18:38.789
Because you acted
like a mad man?

01:18:38.789 --> 01:18:40.491
I did, and it worked.

01:18:43.665 --> 01:18:47.506
<i>It's something</i>
<i>that I guess I have to learn</i>

01:18:47.506 --> 01:18:49.109
<i>to realize that it's something</i>

01:18:49.109 --> 01:18:50.913
<i>that I can't do anything about.</i>

01:18:50.913 --> 01:18:52.650
I can't rectify it.

01:18:52.650 --> 01:18:54.019
I can't solve it.

01:18:54.019 --> 01:18:55.856
I can't punish anybody.

01:18:55.856 --> 01:18:57.760
I can't do anything except

01:18:57.760 --> 01:19:00.000
regret the loss of my son.

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:01.033
Regret the loss of my son.

01:19:01.033 --> 01:19:02.603
And, uh‐‐

01:19:06.410 --> 01:19:08.447
I don't know what else
to say about it.

01:19:37.940 --> 01:19:39.476
<i>Mm‐hmm.</i>

01:19:41.146 --> 01:19:43.017
Is it DNA tested?

01:19:45.789 --> 01:19:49.129
We do not have the level
of forensic expertise

01:19:49.129 --> 01:19:52.168
to prosecute a crime like that.

01:19:52.168 --> 01:19:54.372
‐ Right.
‐ That is a matter of fact.

01:19:54.372 --> 01:19:57.178
We've barely begun
to touch fingerprinting,

01:19:57.178 --> 01:19:58.648
that sort of thing.

01:19:58.648 --> 01:20:00.000
And our murder/conviction rate
is below 3 %.

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:03.224
And our murder/conviction rate
is below 3 %.

01:20:08.100 --> 01:20:09.770
‐ Really?
‐ No.

01:20:32.650 --> 01:20:35.656
<i>And who was</i>
<i>at John's house at the time?</i>

01:20:51.353 --> 01:20:52.623
Mm‐hmm.

01:20:55.428 --> 01:20:58.334
<i>Cash had not</i>
<i>been easy to find.</i>

01:20:58.334 --> 01:21:00.000
<i>Because he didn't want</i>
<i>to be found.</i>

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:00.605
<i>Because he didn't want</i>
<i>to be found.</i>

01:21:00.605 --> 01:21:02.041
<i>Finally, his friend</i>
<i>Eddie Halliday</i>

01:21:02.041 --> 01:21:04.179
<i>urged him to talk to me.</i>

01:21:26.289 --> 01:21:28.026
‐ You know?
‐ He was asking

01:21:28.026 --> 01:21:30.000
to put money
in people's bank accounts?

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:30.331
To put money
in people's bank accounts?

01:21:38.515 --> 01:21:40.886
So, tell me about
what happened

01:21:40.886 --> 01:21:42.523
with Greg Faull.

01:21:57.018 --> 01:21:58.253
What guy's account?

01:22:09.275 --> 01:22:10.979
<i>I was with him the night</i>

01:22:10.979 --> 01:22:12.716
<i>when his neighbor got shot.</i>

01:22:12.716 --> 01:22:15.722
He was with me in the room.

01:22:15.722 --> 01:22:17.860
<i>Like, four in the morning,</i>
<i>he was still there.</i>

01:22:55.735 --> 01:22:57.639
And what was he like?

01:23:00.377 --> 01:23:01.614
You know, this, that.

01:23:07.559 --> 01:23:11.567
Any time in that
period that Greg was killed,

01:23:11.567 --> 01:23:15.775
did you ever see Eddie Mac,
or MAC‐10 at the house?

01:23:15.775 --> 01:23:18.280
He wasn't there the night
dog was poisoned.

01:23:18.280 --> 01:23:20.552
In morning he was there.

01:23:20.552 --> 01:23:23.625
<i>I saw that guy‐‐</i>
<i>this dark‐skinned guy.</i>

01:23:23.625 --> 01:23:25.695
<i>MAC‐10 they call him, yeah.</i>

01:23:25.695 --> 01:23:28.568
<i>I only saw him, like,</i>
<i>just I got a glimpse of him.</i>

01:23:28.568 --> 01:23:30.000
He was in the hall
talking to him.

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:30.905
He was in the hall
talking to him.

01:23:30.905 --> 01:23:33.043
And I just came in,
got a juice,

01:23:33.043 --> 01:23:34.546
and I went back in the room.

01:23:34.546 --> 01:23:36.416
Did you ever
see him again?

01:23:36.416 --> 01:23:37.886
No, I never saw him again.

01:23:48.473 --> 01:23:50.411
To do what?

01:23:52.114 --> 01:23:54.520
You know, to kill the guy.

01:23:56.256 --> 01:23:57.959
<i>Did the police</i>
<i>ever question you</i>

01:23:57.959 --> 01:23:59.630
<i>about the murder</i>
<i>of Greg Faull?</i>

01:24:06.777 --> 01:24:08.280
Well, you know‐‐

01:24:16.496 --> 01:24:17.766
You know?

01:24:22.341 --> 01:24:24.580
<i>I was trying to find</i>
<i>Eddie McKoy</i>

01:24:24.580 --> 01:24:28.153
<i>to ask him about</i>
<i>these new allegations.</i>

01:24:28.153 --> 01:24:30.000
<i>Eventually, he agreed</i>
<i>to meet me a second time.</i>

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:31.527
<i>Eventually, he agreed</i>
<i>to meet me a second time.</i>

01:24:31.527 --> 01:24:33.664
<i>What new information</i>
<i>do you have for me?</i>

01:24:37.171 --> 01:24:39.475
Well,
I've looked into that.

01:24:41.379 --> 01:24:43.651
Okay, all right.
Where were you

01:24:43.651 --> 01:24:46.557
when Greg Faull was killed?

01:24:46.557 --> 01:24:49.797
So can you tell me
the real story?

01:24:49.797 --> 01:24:51.967
So around that time,
did John ask you

01:24:51.967 --> 01:24:54.205
to do something
and give you any money?

01:24:54.205 --> 01:24:57.178
Like $5,000?

01:24:57.178 --> 01:24:58.981
‐ Mm‐hmm.
‐ No.

01:24:58.981 --> 01:25:00.000
‐ No?
‐ No, never.

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:00.552
‐ No?
‐ No, never.

01:25:05.427 --> 01:25:06.764
Why are you smiling?

01:25:13.210 --> 01:25:15.615
‐ No?
‐ No.

01:25:15.615 --> 01:25:17.284
So you didn't get $5,000

01:25:17.284 --> 01:25:19.890
wired into your account?

01:25:19.890 --> 01:25:23.163
So some people said
they saw you that night.

01:25:23.163 --> 01:25:25.902
And‐‐and you went
to John's house.

01:25:25.902 --> 01:25:27.404
No.

01:25:29.375 --> 01:25:30.000
‐ Oh, no. Never.
‐ Never?

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:31.312
‐ Oh, no. Never.
‐ Never?

01:25:31.312 --> 01:25:33.551
‐ Never.
‐ Okay.

01:25:39.161 --> 01:25:40.565
So you
were not hired by John

01:25:40.565 --> 01:25:42.769
‐ to kill Greg Faull?
‐ No, no. Never.

01:25:44.673 --> 01:25:46.376
And if you were,
would you tell me?

01:25:46.376 --> 01:25:47.545
No, I‐‐well‐‐

01:25:52.555 --> 01:25:54.358
Mm‐hmm.
All right‐‐

01:25:56.864 --> 01:25:58.233
So I‐‐
I'm just trying to understand

01:25:58.233 --> 01:26:00.000
why someone would say this.

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:00.203
Why someone would say this.

01:26:02.441 --> 01:26:03.778
‐ I cannot tell you.
‐ Okay.

01:26:03.778 --> 01:26:05.682
Did you have an alibi?

01:26:10.758 --> 01:26:12.762
So...

01:26:14.700 --> 01:26:17.171
Mm‐hmm.

01:26:17.171 --> 01:26:20.010
<i>I wanted to check out</i>

<i>and asking questions?</i>

01:26:28.894 --> 01:26:30.000
<i>Not a good idea.</i>

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:30.598

So I gotta keep the public
interested in me, right?

01:27:20.765 --> 01:27:22.334
‐ Yep.
‐ Well, I can do it

01:27:22.334 --> 01:27:23.503

any number of things.

01:27:23.503 --> 01:27:24.773

Uh, whatever it takes.

01:27:28.614 --> 01:27:30.000
He goes from running away

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:31.018
He goes from running away

01:27:31.018 --> 01:27:32.989
from something
to now running for.

01:27:32.989 --> 01:27:34.258
And in this case,
he wanted to be

01:27:34.258 --> 01:27:35.995

have you started to raise money?

01:27:44.445 --> 01:27:46.215

01:27:52.194 --> 01:27:54.900

01:27:54.900 --> 01:27:57.471
media attention
as he would like,

01:27:57.471 --> 01:27:59.743
then he'll absolutely
do something outrageous,

01:27:59.743 --> 01:28:00.000
say something outrageous,
post something outrageous.

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:02.414

Mr. McAfee, as president,
what would you do about ISIS?

01:28:18.379 --> 01:28:21.620
ISIS is a problem
of intelligence gathering

01:28:21.620 --> 01:28:23.223
more than anything else.

01:28:23.223 --> 01:28:24.893

No, it just doesn't happen.

No, it just doesn't happen.

They are so far ahead of us

01:30:11.873 --> 01:30:15.280
