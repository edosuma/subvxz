03:03.058 --> 03:05.601
My story begins in London.

03:05.727 --> 03:08.521
Not so very long ago.

03:08.605 --> 03:10.606
And yet so much
has happened since then,

03:10.691 --> 03:13.276
that it seems more like an eternity.

03:13.944 --> 03:16.362
At that time, I lived with my pet

03:16.446 --> 03:19.448
in a bachelor flat
just off Regent's Park.

03:21.034 --> 03:23.452
It was a beautiful spring day,

03:23.579 --> 03:26.455
a tedious time of the year
for bachelors.

03:26.623 --> 03:28.875
Oh. That's my pet, Roger.

03:28.959 --> 03:32.461
Roger Radcliffe, a musician ofsorts.

03:32.546 --> 03:35.464
No. No, I'm the one with the spots.

03:35.591 --> 03:37.800
My name's Pongo.

03:37.885 --> 03:40.887
And you know, as far as I could see,

03:40.971 --> 03:44.974
the old notion that a bachelor's
life was so glamorous

03:45.100 --> 03:46.976
and carefree was all nonsense.

03:47.102 --> 03:49.437
It was downright dull.

04:00.073 --> 04:04.243
It was plain to see
that my old pet needed someone.

04:04.328 --> 04:08.331
But ifit were left up to Roger,
we'd be bachelors forever.

04:08.457 --> 04:11.584
He was married to his work.
Writing songs.

04:11.668 --> 04:13.586
Songs about romance, of all things,

04:13.670 --> 04:16.630
something he knew
absolutely nothing about.

04:20.469 --> 04:23.429
Oh, he's intelligent enough,
as humans go.

04:23.513 --> 04:25.181
And I think you could say

04:25.307 --> 04:27.850
that Roger is a rather
handsome animal in his way.

04:28.852 --> 04:33.272
I could see no reason why my pet
didn't deserve an attractive mate.

04:34.274 --> 04:38.527
At least, I was determined
to do my best.

04:38.654 --> 04:42.531
Of course, dogs are a pretty
poor judge of human beauty.

04:46.328 --> 04:50.373
But I had a rough idea
of what to look for.

04:53.627 --> 04:55.169
Unusual breed.

04:57.965 --> 04:59.882
Very unusual.

05:01.969 --> 05:03.552
Oh, surely not.

05:05.722 --> 05:07.556
Well, now, what have we here?

05:11.728 --> 05:15.356
Well, a little too short-coupled.

05:16.191 --> 05:17.358
Nope.

05:18.151 --> 05:21.821
I say... Oh, well I do say!

05:21.905 --> 05:24.073
Now, there's a fancy breed.

05:27.327 --> 05:30.162
Perhaps a little too fancy.

05:30.414 --> 05:33.833
Yes. That's much too fancy.

05:35.252 --> 05:36.836
Too old.

05:36.920 --> 05:38.754
Too young.

05:40.507 --> 05:43.426
It was a problem. A real problem.

05:46.096 --> 05:49.432
Well, now that's a bit more like it!

05:49.558 --> 05:52.852
The most beautiful
creature on four legs.

05:53.937 --> 05:56.772
Oh, now, if only the girl...

05:56.898 --> 06:00.109
Well! She's very lovely, too.

06:00.235 --> 06:02.111
It was almost too good to be true.

06:02.237 --> 06:05.823
I'd never find anotherpair like that,
not if I looked for 100 years.

06:08.952 --> 06:10.995
They're heading for the park.

06:11.121 --> 06:14.665
A perfect meeting place,
if I could only arrange it.

06:15.625 --> 06:19.253
But Roger never
stopped work 'till after 5. 00.

06:19.337 --> 06:21.338
That would be too late.

06:38.482 --> 06:41.317
After 5.00 already.

06:43.653 --> 06:44.820
Fancy that.

06:46.531 --> 06:50.618
All right, Pongo. All right, boy.

07:15.477 --> 07:17.353
Pongo, boy, take it easy!

07:17.479 --> 07:19.480
What's all the hurry?

07:28.490 --> 07:30.866
Pongo, boy, slow down.

07:44.589 --> 07:48.634
I was afraid we'd missed them.
Perhaps they passed on by the park.

07:48.718 --> 07:50.845
Then suddenly, I spotted them.

07:50.929 --> 07:54.390
It was a perfect situation
if I planned it right.

07:55.892 --> 07:58.310
I couldn't depend on Roger.
I knew what he'd do.

07:58.395 --> 08:01.564
He'd settle on the grass,
puffhis pipe and that would be it.

08:02.274 --> 08:05.317
No, it was all up to me.

08:05.402 --> 08:07.444
Well...

08:29.426 --> 08:32.303
At first I had no particularplan,

08:32.429 --> 08:34.597
just anything to attract attention.

08:34.722 --> 08:36.765
You know, stir things up a bit.

08:40.437 --> 08:43.313
Pongo, you silly old thing! Come on.

08:43.440 --> 08:44.899
Come on, let's have it, boy.

08:44.983 --> 08:51.989
Pongo!

08:59.956 --> 09:02.917
For a while, it seemed to work.

09:03.001 --> 09:05.377
At least they had seen one another.

09:05.462 --> 09:07.796
Things were going along first-rate.

09:09.132 --> 09:12.259
But for some strange reason they left!

09:15.972 --> 09:19.850
Come on, you old renegade.
We're going home.

09:19.976 --> 09:21.810
But I wasn't giving up.

09:21.937 --> 09:25.814
I was determined that, somehow,
theyjust had to meet.

09:30.820 --> 09:33.656
I beg your pardon. I'm so sorry.
Please excuse me.

09:33.782 --> 09:36.492
- I must say, what on earth!
- Oh, dear!

09:36.618 --> 09:39.995
Oh, really. Good heavens. Of all the...

09:50.090 --> 09:54.677
Oh, my new spring suit and my new hat!

09:56.054 --> 09:57.846
I'm terribly sorry.

09:58.682 --> 10:00.849
Please let me help you.

10:00.934 --> 10:02.768
I'm so sorry. Pongo, you...

10:02.852 --> 10:05.562
I don't know what's come over him.

10:05.689 --> 10:08.899
I'm terribly sorry.
He's never acted this way before.

10:09.025 --> 10:10.609
Never mind. Never mind.

10:10.694 --> 10:13.696
Please, just go away.
You've done enough.

10:13.780 --> 10:15.948
Please? Oh.

10:16.032 --> 10:18.867
Oh, I say. Here, take mine.

10:40.640 --> 10:43.726
Wilt thou love her, comfort her,

10:43.810 --> 10:47.229
honour and keep her
in sickness and in health,

10:47.314 --> 10:49.815
and forsaking all others,

10:49.899 --> 10:54.445
keep thee only unto her
so long as ye both shall live?

10:54.571 --> 10:56.071
I will.

10:57.991 --> 11:00.117
For the first six months or so,

11:00.243 --> 11:02.911
we lived in a small house
near the park,

11:02.996 --> 11:04.997
a modest little place,

11:05.081 --> 11:08.459
but just right for two couples
who werejust starting out.

11:15.425 --> 11:18.177
Perdita, darling, are you all right?

11:18.261 --> 11:22.264
Oh, of course, dear.

11:22.349 --> 11:26.268
After all, dogs were having
puppies long before our time.

11:32.359 --> 11:35.444
Oh, that's Nanny,
a wonderful cook and housekeeper.

11:36.363 --> 11:38.364
She's such a kind, understanding soul.

11:40.450 --> 11:42.159
You know,

11:42.285 --> 11:44.828
at times she seems almost canine.

11:44.954 --> 11:46.789
Roger, dear,

11:46.873 --> 11:49.458
tea time.

11:49.542 --> 11:51.168
Tea time!

11:54.714 --> 11:57.883
Be down in a minute

12:09.646 --> 12:11.647
Do you like my new song?

12:14.651 --> 12:18.695
- Such clever lyrics.
- Melody first, my dear.

12:18.822 --> 12:20.906
And then the lyrics.

12:28.081 --> 12:32.000
Oh, Pongo, it's her.
It's that devil woman.

12:39.426 --> 12:43.679
Oh, must be Cruella,
your dearly devoted old school mate.

12:43.763 --> 12:46.348
Cruella De Vil.

12:46.433 --> 12:47.641
That's it!

12:47.725 --> 12:51.937
Cruella De Vil

12:52.021 --> 12:56.150
lfshe doesn't scare you
no evil thing will

12:56.234 --> 12:57.401
Oh, Roger.

12:57.527 --> 12:59.778
To see her is to take a sudden chill

13:01.030 --> 13:05.451
Cruella

13:05.535 --> 13:08.954
She's like a spider
waiting for the kill

13:09.289 --> 13:10.747
Roger, she'll hear you.

13:10.874 --> 13:13.459
Look out for Cruella De Vil

13:16.379 --> 13:18.297
Let her in, Nanny.

13:18.381 --> 13:21.216
- Anita, darling!
- How are you?

13:21.301 --> 13:24.887
Miserable as usual. Perfectly wretched!

13:27.265 --> 13:29.808
Where are they? Where are they?

13:35.732 --> 13:37.691
For heaven sakes, where are they?

13:37.775 --> 13:40.110
- Who, Cruella?
- The puppies! The puppies.

13:42.113 --> 13:44.615
No time for games.
Where are the little brutes?

13:47.368 --> 13:51.830
It'll be at least three weeks.
No rushing these things.

13:51.915 --> 13:54.708
Anita, you're such a wit.

13:55.793 --> 13:57.878
Here, dog, here.

13:57.962 --> 14:00.130
Here, dog.

14:00.215 --> 14:03.217
Cruella, isn't that a new fur coat?

14:03.301 --> 14:06.220
My only true love, darling.

14:06.304 --> 14:10.349
I live for furs. I worship furs!

14:12.310 --> 14:16.188
After all, is there a woman in
this wretched world who doesn't?

14:22.320 --> 14:25.531
Oh, I'd like a nice fur,
but there are many other things...

14:25.615 --> 14:28.867
Sweet, simple Anita.

14:28.952 --> 14:31.370
I know, I know!

14:31.454 --> 14:34.581
This horrid little house
is your dream castle.

14:37.168 --> 14:41.672
And poor Roger is your
bold and fearless Sir Galahad!

14:43.424 --> 14:44.883
Oh, Cruella.

14:44.968 --> 14:49.263
Then of course you have
your little spotted friends.

14:49.347 --> 14:52.057
Oh, yes.

14:52.141 --> 14:56.228
Yes, I must say, such
perfectly beautiful coats.

14:56.312 --> 14:59.648
- Won't you have some tea?
- I've got to run.

14:59.732 --> 15:01.567
Let me know when the puppies arrive.

15:01.651 --> 15:04.027
- You will, won't you, dear?
- Yes, Cruella.

15:04.112 --> 15:07.364
Don't forget, it's a promise.
See you in three weeks. Cheerio.

15:07.448 --> 15:09.283
Cheerio, darling.

15:13.454 --> 15:18.000
At first you think
Cruella is a devil

15:18.084 --> 15:21.253
But after time
has worn away the shock

15:22.630 --> 15:24.423
You come to realise

15:24.507 --> 15:26.842
You've seen her kind of eyes

15:26.926 --> 15:30.929
Watching you from underneath a rock

15:31.014 --> 15:32.389
You're no help.

15:32.473 --> 15:34.141
This vampire bat

15:34.225 --> 15:36.393
This inhuman beast

15:36.477 --> 15:40.230
She ought to be locked up
and never released

15:40.315 --> 15:45.277
The world was such
a wholesome place until

15:45.361 --> 15:49.615
Cruella
Cruella De Vil

15:53.119 --> 15:55.120
Roger, you are an idiot!

15:58.708 --> 16:02.461
- Perdy?
- That witch. That devil woman.

16:02.545 --> 16:05.005
She wants our puppies.
That's all she's after.

16:05.089 --> 16:07.466
Don't worry, Perdy. They're on to her.

16:07.550 --> 16:10.177
Nothing's going to happen
to our puppies.

16:10.261 --> 16:13.472
What does she want with them?
She can't possibly love them.

16:14.974 --> 16:17.017
Oh, Pongo.

16:17.101 --> 16:19.811
I was so happy at first, but now I...

16:22.315 --> 16:23.565
Oh, I...

16:23.650 --> 16:26.568
I wish we weren't having any.

16:38.581 --> 16:42.209
Poor Perdita.
Of course, she had no choice.

16:42.293 --> 16:44.419
The puppies arrived right on schedule,

16:44.504 --> 16:47.756
one wild and stormy night in October.

17:26.295 --> 17:27.963
Steady, boy.

17:28.047 --> 17:30.632
The puppies are here!

17:30.717 --> 17:33.009
Oh, the puppies are here!

17:33.094 --> 17:34.678
How many?

17:34.762 --> 17:37.013
- Eight.
- Eight?

17:39.434 --> 17:43.353
By George, Pongo! Eight puppies.

17:43.438 --> 17:45.439
Ten.

17:45.523 --> 17:48.108
- Eleven.
- Eleven.

17:48.192 --> 17:52.821
Eleven? Eleven puppies, Pongo, boy.

17:52.905 --> 17:56.783
Wait a minute now, wait a minute, 13!

17:58.161 --> 18:00.746
No, no, no. Fourteen.

18:00.830 --> 18:04.458
- Oh, 15!
- Fifteen?

18:04.542 --> 18:08.837
And the mother's doing fine, love.

18:08.921 --> 18:11.298
You ducky thing, you.

18:12.383 --> 18:14.259
Fifteen puppies?

18:14.343 --> 18:16.261
Why, Pongo, that's marvellous!

18:16.345 --> 18:18.597
It's fabulous!

18:18.681 --> 18:21.600
Why, you old rascal!

18:21.684 --> 18:23.685
Fourteen.

18:25.688 --> 18:28.565
Just 14.

18:28.649 --> 18:31.193
We lost one.

18:31.986 --> 18:34.696
Oh, poor little thing.

18:39.368 --> 18:41.870
Oh, Pongo, boy.

18:41.954 --> 18:44.956
It's just one of those things.

18:47.043 --> 18:49.211
And yet...

18:49.295 --> 18:51.963
And yet I wonder.

19:15.279 --> 19:17.113
Look, Pongo.

19:21.911 --> 19:23.578
Anita!

19:23.663 --> 19:26.331
Nanny. Fifteen!

19:26.415 --> 19:29.209
We still have 15!

19:29.293 --> 19:32.087
Oh, Roger, he's all right!
Thank heaven.

19:32.171 --> 19:34.840
See? He's just as good as new.

19:34.924 --> 19:38.301
Can you imagine, Roger, 15 puppies!

19:39.512 --> 19:43.515
Fifteen. Fifteen puppies!

19:43.599 --> 19:44.933
How marvellous.

19:45.017 --> 19:48.645
How marvellous, how perfectly...

19:48.729 --> 19:52.691
The devil take it.
They're mongrels, no spots!

19:52.775 --> 19:55.902
No spots at all.
What a horrid little white rat.

19:55.987 --> 19:57.696
They're not mongrels!

19:57.780 --> 20:01.283
They'll get their spots.
Just wait and see.

20:01.367 --> 20:04.703
That's right.
They'll have their spots in a few weeks.

20:04.787 --> 20:08.957
Oh, well, in that case
I'll take them all. The whole litter.

20:09.041 --> 20:10.542
Just name your price, dear.

20:10.626 --> 20:13.044
I'm afraid we can't give them up.

20:13.129 --> 20:17.048
- Poor Perdita, she'd be heartbroken.
- Anita, don't be ridiculous.

20:17.133 --> 20:18.800
You can't afford to keep them.

20:18.926 --> 20:21.303
You can scarcely afford
to feed yourselves.

20:21.387 --> 20:23.638
I'm sure we'll get along.

20:23.723 --> 20:26.641
Yes, I know. I know!

20:26.726 --> 20:30.145
Roger's... Roger's songs!

20:34.817 --> 20:38.320
Enough of this nonsense.
I'll pay you twice what they're worth.

20:38.446 --> 20:40.488
Come now, I'm being
more than generous.

20:40.615 --> 20:41.990
Blast this pen.

20:42.116 --> 20:46.119
Blast this wretched, wretched pen!

20:49.332 --> 20:51.583
When can the puppies
leave their mother?

20:51.667 --> 20:54.502
Two weeks? Three weeks?

20:54.629 --> 20:56.421
Never.

20:56.505 --> 21:01.092
- What?
- We're not selling the puppies.

21:01.177 --> 21:05.180
Not a single one. Do you understand?

21:05.306 --> 21:08.016
Anita, is he serious?

21:08.100 --> 21:09.684
I really don't know Roger.

21:09.810 --> 21:13.688
- Cruella, he seems...
- Surely he must be joking!

21:13.814 --> 21:16.191
No, no, no. I mean it.

21:16.275 --> 21:19.444
You're, you're not getting one. Not one.

21:19.528 --> 21:22.155
And that's final.

21:23.491 --> 21:27.118
Why, you horrid man!

21:27.203 --> 21:29.621
You... You...

21:29.705 --> 21:33.291
All right, keep the little
beasts for all I care.

21:33.376 --> 21:35.543
Do as you like with them. Drown them!

21:35.670 --> 21:39.547
But I warn you, Anita, We're through.
I'm through with all of you!

21:39.674 --> 21:41.967
I'll get even. Just wait.

21:42.051 --> 21:44.886
You'll be sorry, you fools!

21:44.971 --> 21:47.889
You idiots!

21:52.645 --> 21:55.730
Oh, Roger!
You were magnificent, darling.

21:55.856 --> 21:58.066
He was a bloomin' hero, ma'am!

21:58.192 --> 22:01.152
Indeed he was. A bloomin' hero!

22:05.241 --> 22:06.825
Perdy? Perdy, darling?

22:06.909 --> 22:09.661
We're keeping the puppies,
every single one of them.

22:09.745 --> 22:12.247
My ol' pet Roger,
he told that devil woman off.

22:12.373 --> 22:14.666
He told her off, Perdy. She's gone.

22:14.750 --> 22:18.753
- Darling, she's gone for good.
- Oh, Pongo.

22:35.104 --> 22:38.523
- Come on, Thunderbolt.
- Come on, Thunderbolt.

22:45.781 --> 22:47.615
Go get him, Thunder.

22:49.618 --> 22:51.036
After him, boy.

22:51.120 --> 22:53.872
He'll get that dirty ol' horse thief.

22:53.956 --> 22:57.042
Old Thunderbolt's the greatest
dog in the whole world.

22:57.126 --> 22:59.210
He's even better than Dad.

22:59.295 --> 23:01.588
No dog's better than Dad.

23:02.840 --> 23:04.549
What's he going to do, Dad?

23:04.633 --> 23:07.761
Let's just wait and see.

23:12.433 --> 23:14.976
Look at him run, the old coward.

23:15.102 --> 23:16.978
That old dirty Dawson!

23:17.104 --> 23:19.147
The yellow-livered old skunk!

23:19.273 --> 23:22.358
I'd like to tear his gizzard out.

23:22.485 --> 23:25.320
Why, Patch, where did
you ever hear such talk?

23:25.446 --> 23:27.822
Certainly not from your mother.

23:35.164 --> 23:38.041
- Watch out, Thunder.
- Don't worry, Penny.

23:38.167 --> 23:40.293
He'll get that yellow-livered...

23:40.377 --> 23:43.880
Well, he'll get him, all right.

23:44.006 --> 23:47.842
Lucky, get down.
We can't see. Get down.

23:47.968 --> 23:50.011
Mother, make him get down.

23:50.137 --> 23:52.347
Come on, Lucky. Down, dear.

23:55.351 --> 23:57.852
Missed him. Missed him by a mile.

24:02.024 --> 24:04.692
I'm hungry, mother. I'm hungry.

24:04.819 --> 24:06.778
Now, Rolly, you've just had your dinner.

24:06.862 --> 24:08.863
But I am, just the same.

24:08.989 --> 24:12.033
I'm so hungry I could eat
a whole elephant.

24:14.245 --> 24:16.913
There he is, behind that rock.

24:22.670 --> 24:24.838
Oh, dear. He shot poor Thunder.

24:24.922 --> 24:29.717
He missed him.
OI' Thunder's pretending, I think.

24:37.601 --> 24:40.478
See? What did I tell you?
That's one of his tricks.

24:40.563 --> 24:41.855
Lucky, get down.

25:02.918 --> 25:06.254
I'm hungry, Mother. I really am.

25:08.382 --> 25:12.844
Don't miss next week's episode.
Who will triumph?

25:12.928 --> 25:14.888
OI' Thunder always wins!

25:15.764 --> 25:18.099
And speaking of champions, friends,

25:18.225 --> 25:22.020
Kanine Krunchies is the
champion of all dog biscuits.

25:22.104 --> 25:23.771
Kanine Krunchies can't be beat

25:23.898 --> 25:25.815
They make each meal a special treat

25:25.941 --> 25:30.278
Happy dogs are those who eat
nutritious Kanine Krunchies

25:31.572 --> 25:34.282
Perdy, we better get these
little nippers off to bed

25:34.408 --> 25:36.618
if we're going for a W-A-L-K.

25:36.744 --> 25:39.287
- We want to go, too, Mother.
- Can we, Mother?

25:39.413 --> 25:41.623
We never get to go.

25:41.749 --> 25:43.958
Come along, children. Bedtime.

25:44.084 --> 25:48.296
But we're not a bit sleepy.

25:48.422 --> 25:51.341
We want to go for a walk in the park.

25:52.009 --> 25:55.136
- Dad, can we?
- Better do as your mother says.

25:57.640 --> 25:59.974
One, two, three, four,

26:00.100 --> 26:04.354
five, six, seven,

26:04.480 --> 26:06.773
eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13...

26:06.857 --> 26:09.234
I'm not sleepy. I'm hungry.

26:09.318 --> 26:11.027
Fourteen.

26:13.530 --> 26:16.241
So do what all the smart dogs do

26:16.325 --> 26:18.451
And you'll feel great
the whole day through

26:18.535 --> 26:22.497
You can be a champion, too
if you eat Kanine Krunchies

26:22.623 --> 26:25.708
Remember, friends, just send five...

26:25.834 --> 26:28.378
Lucky, you little rascal, let's go.

26:48.190 --> 26:50.400
There they go, Horace, me lad,

26:50.526 --> 26:53.236
out for their evening constitutional.

26:53.362 --> 26:56.197
Oh. A lovely pair of turtledoves.

26:57.032 --> 27:00.326
Around the Johnny Horner
and off to the park.

27:00.411 --> 27:04.163
Yeah, I don't like it, Jasper.

27:04.248 --> 27:06.916
One more pinch
and they'll throw the keys away.

27:07.042 --> 27:09.669
Oh, come off it, Horace.
We're getting plenty of boodle.

27:09.753 --> 27:13.006
Yes, but I've been thinkin'.

27:13.090 --> 27:17.802
You've been thinkin'?
I warned you about thinkin'.

27:17.886 --> 27:20.555
I've got the knob for this job,
so let's get on with it.

27:31.900 --> 27:35.445
Nobody home but the little ol' cook.

27:35.571 --> 27:37.530
You just leave her to ol' Jasper.

27:37.614 --> 27:40.533
He can handle her real diplomatic-like.

27:40.617 --> 27:44.412
Yeah, but I still don't like it.

27:45.748 --> 27:49.876
Here, here. Patch, you settle down.

27:51.754 --> 27:53.212
Oh, dear.

27:53.297 --> 27:56.841
Go to sleep now. Close your little eyes.

27:56.925 --> 28:00.595
That's a good little one.

28:03.599 --> 28:05.933
Who do you suppose?

28:07.811 --> 28:09.562
Good evening, ma'am.

28:09.646 --> 28:12.732
We're here to inspect
the wiring and the switches.

28:12.816 --> 28:15.860
- We're from the gas company.
- Electric, electric.

28:15.944 --> 28:17.236
Electric company.

28:17.321 --> 28:19.906
But we didn't call for any inspection.

28:19.990 --> 28:23.242
Yes, I know. See, there's a new act
just been passed in Parliament.

28:23.327 --> 28:27.246
Under the heading of the "Defence of
the Realm Act." Article four, section 29.

28:27.331 --> 28:29.582
It's a law.
And it's for your own safety, ma'am.

28:29.666 --> 28:33.086
I don't care what Parliament Realm
or whatever it is says.

28:33.170 --> 28:36.547
You're not coming in here,
not with the Mister and Missus gone.

28:36.632 --> 28:39.801
Oh, now. Come off it, Ducky.
We got no time to palaver.

28:39.927 --> 28:43.012
We got a job to do. Excuse me!

28:44.681 --> 28:46.265
What's the matter with you two?

28:46.350 --> 28:49.977
You got cloth ears?
I said you're not coming in here!

28:51.814 --> 28:55.983
She's a regular little tartar,
ain't she, Horace?

28:56.110 --> 28:59.487
Don't you dare go up there,
you big, long-legged lummox!

28:59.613 --> 29:01.656
Now I mean it.

29:01.740 --> 29:04.325
If you don't get out of this house,

29:04.410 --> 29:06.828
I'll call the police, I will.

29:06.954 --> 29:11.416
Now be off with you, you big weasel!

29:11.500 --> 29:13.167
Now you've been gone and done it.

29:13.252 --> 29:15.002
You've cut me to the quick, lady.

29:15.087 --> 29:18.756
Why, I wouldn't stay here
if you asked me.

29:18.841 --> 29:20.800
Not even for a cup of tea.

29:20.926 --> 29:25.430
Horace, me lad, I've got a sneaky
suspicion we're not welcome here.

29:25.514 --> 29:27.432
Pack up. We're leaving.

29:27.516 --> 29:29.767
Sharp's the word and quick's the action.

29:29.852 --> 29:31.936
Let me out! Help!

29:32.020 --> 29:34.522
I'll call the police. Help!

29:36.859 --> 29:39.944
Goodnight, Ducky. Ta-ta!

29:40.028 --> 29:42.113
Those good-for-nothing hoodlums!

29:42.197 --> 29:44.282
Electric company.

29:45.993 --> 29:47.994
Nothing but common sneak thieves.

29:52.666 --> 29:56.210
I'll bet they made off
with the good silver.

29:56.336 --> 29:59.046
Why, I'll bet they took every last...

29:59.173 --> 30:01.132
The puppies!

30:01.216 --> 30:05.720
The puppies! They're gone!
Patch? Lucky? Rolly?

30:05.846 --> 30:08.139
Oh! They took the puppies!

30:08.223 --> 30:10.475
Oh, whatever will I do?

30:10.559 --> 30:13.978
Those scoundrels!
They stole the puppies.

30:14.062 --> 30:16.647
Police? Help! The puppies.

30:16.732 --> 30:18.983
Police! Somebody help me!

30:19.067 --> 30:22.195
Help! Help! Help!

30:25.240 --> 30:29.911
"Dognapping!"
Can you imagine such a thing?

30:31.205 --> 30:36.667
"15 puppies stolen."
They are darling little things.

30:38.420 --> 30:40.922
Anita and her...

30:41.715 --> 30:45.092
And her bashful Beethoven!

30:45.219 --> 30:46.677
Pipe and all!

30:48.222 --> 30:50.598
Oh, Roger, you are a fool!

30:57.439 --> 30:59.357
Hello?

30:59.441 --> 31:02.193
Jasper! Jasper, you idiot!

31:02.277 --> 31:03.778
How dare you call here?

31:03.904 --> 31:06.864
We don't want no more of this,
we want our boodle!

31:06.949 --> 31:08.783
We'll settle for half!

31:08.867 --> 31:10.785
Not one shilling 'til the job's done.

31:10.911 --> 31:13.538
- Jasper! Jasper!
- Do you understand?

31:13.622 --> 31:16.541
It's in the blinkin' papers,
pictures and all!

31:16.625 --> 31:19.126
Hang the papers!
It'll be forgotten tomorrow.

31:19.253 --> 31:23.297
- I don't like it.
- Shut up, you idiot!

31:23.382 --> 31:26.884
- What?
- Not you, miss. I mean Horace!

31:26.969 --> 31:29.095
Why, you imbecile!

31:45.279 --> 31:46.654
Maybe Scotland Yard.

31:46.780 --> 31:49.740
Maybe they found something.
Hello, Inspector?

31:49.825 --> 31:51.409
- Is Anita there?
- Who?

31:51.493 --> 31:54.245
- Anita!
- It's for you.

31:54.329 --> 31:56.247
- Hello?
- Anita, darling.

31:56.331 --> 31:58.082
- Oh. Cruella.
- Oh, Anita.

31:58.166 --> 32:00.334
What a dreadful thing.
I just saw the papers.

32:00.419 --> 32:02.003
I couldn't believe it.

32:02.129 --> 32:04.338
Yes, Cruella. It was quite a shock.

32:04.423 --> 32:07.174
- Is she calling to confess?
- Roger, please!

32:07.301 --> 32:08.843
She's a sly one.

32:08.969 --> 32:11.012
We're doing everything possible.

32:11.138 --> 32:14.682
- Have you called the police?
- Yes, Scotland Yard.

32:14.766 --> 32:16.684
- But I'm afraid...
- Where are they?

32:16.768 --> 32:17.768
You idiot!

32:17.853 --> 32:20.354
- Anita!
- Sorry, Cruella.

32:20.439 --> 32:24.525
Yes. If there's any news,
we'll let you know.

32:24.651 --> 32:26.193
Thank you, Cruella.

32:27.487 --> 32:30.197
Roger, I admit she's eccentric,
but she's not a thief.

32:30.282 --> 32:32.366
She's still number one
suspect in my book!

32:32.492 --> 32:34.785
She's been investigated
by Scotland Yard.

32:34.870 --> 32:38.873
- What more do you want?
- I don't know, darling.

32:38.957 --> 32:40.875
I don't know.

32:41.001 --> 32:44.337
Oh, Rog. What'll we do?

32:45.547 --> 32:47.465
What'll we do?

32:54.681 --> 32:58.809
Perdy, I'm afraid it's all up to us.

32:58.894 --> 33:03.481
Oh, Pongo. Isn't there any hope?

33:03.565 --> 33:06.817
Well, yes. There's the twilight bark.

33:06.902 --> 33:10.404
The twilight bark?
That's only a gossip chain.

33:10.530 --> 33:13.240
Darling, it's the very
fastest way to send news.

33:13.325 --> 33:17.578
If our puppies are anywhere in the city,
the London dogs will know.

33:17.663 --> 33:21.332
We'll send the word tonight when our
pets take us for a walk in the park.

33:31.718 --> 33:35.930
There's no one out tonight.
I'm afraid it's too cold.

33:36.056 --> 33:38.349
We've got to keep trying, Perdy.

33:49.069 --> 33:50.945
Perdy, we're in luck!

33:51.071 --> 33:53.280
It's the Great Dane at Hampstead.

33:54.866 --> 33:57.284
Pongo. Quiet, boy!

33:57.411 --> 34:00.454
Do you want to stir up the whole
neighbourhood? Come on. Pongo.

34:00.539 --> 34:03.124
- Perdy, come on!
- Let's go.

34:03.208 --> 34:06.711
Pongo, you old idiot!

34:10.382 --> 34:12.632
Come on, now. We're going home!

34:28.984 --> 34:31.485
What is it, Danny?
Who's on the telegraph?

34:31.610 --> 34:35.489
It's Pongo, Regent's Park!
It's an all-dog alert.

34:35.614 --> 34:39.577
What's it all about? What's the word?
Tell me, Danny! Tell me, tell me!

34:39.661 --> 34:42.413
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

34:47.502 --> 34:51.672
Well, now... That is something.

34:53.007 --> 34:54.592
What, Danny? What's something?

34:54.676 --> 34:58.095
Fifteen Dalmatian puppies, stolen!

34:58.180 --> 35:01.682
Have they called the police?
Scotland Yard?

35:01.767 --> 35:02.933
The humans tried everything.

35:03.018 --> 35:06.020
Now it's up to us dogs
and the twilight bark.

35:06.104 --> 35:08.355
I'll sound the alert!

35:35.842 --> 35:37.885
Prissy, come in here!

35:57.239 --> 35:59.073
Coco!

35:59.157 --> 36:00.908
Be quiet now!

36:07.582 --> 36:10.084
Shut up!

36:11.169 --> 36:12.586
Quiet!

36:18.385 --> 36:20.761
Will you be quiet!

36:52.752 --> 36:54.628
Towser, what's going on?

36:54.713 --> 36:57.131
What is it? What's all the gossip?

36:57.215 --> 37:01.802
'Tain't no gossip, Lucy.
It be all the way from London.

37:01.928 --> 37:05.472
- You don't say!
- Fifteen puppies stolen.

37:05.557 --> 37:08.726
There's no puppies around here,
not since Nellie's last litter.

37:08.810 --> 37:10.144
And they're all grown up.

37:10.270 --> 37:13.397
Well, then, we'd best
send the word along.

37:13.481 --> 37:16.567
It be up to me to reach the Colonel!

37:16.651 --> 37:19.653
He be the only one in barking range.

37:19.738 --> 37:21.488
You'll never reach him at this hour!

37:21.573 --> 37:23.574
Well, I can try!

37:23.658 --> 37:26.243
I'll bark all night if I have to.

37:47.974 --> 37:51.018
Sounds like old Towser.

37:51.978 --> 37:54.521
It's an alert. Sergeant!

37:54.606 --> 37:58.525
Sergeant Tibs! I say, Sergeant!

38:01.613 --> 38:03.197
Oh, yes, Captain!

38:03.281 --> 38:06.533
Barking signal. It's an alert.
Report to the Colonel at once.

38:06.618 --> 38:08.953
Yes, sir. Right-o, sir. Right away, sir!

38:12.499 --> 38:14.375
Colonel?

38:14.459 --> 38:17.378
I say, Colonel! Colonel, sir? Colonel?

38:17.504 --> 38:21.382
- Colonel?
- What? Who goes there?

38:21.508 --> 38:23.467
Sergeant Tibs reporting, sir.

38:23.551 --> 38:27.054
- Tibs? Tibs? Oh, yes, Sergeant Tibs!
- Colonel, sir...

38:27.180 --> 38:31.141
Look here, Tibs. What's the idea
of barging in at this hour?

38:31.226 --> 38:33.227
- But Colonel...
- Hold on, Sergeant.

38:33.353 --> 38:35.562
You hear that?

38:35.689 --> 38:38.065
- Sounds like an alert.
- Yes, Colonel.

38:38.149 --> 38:40.901
We'd better look into it.
Come along, on the double.

38:40.986 --> 38:42.236
Right-o, sir.

38:44.906 --> 38:47.408
It's old Towser down
at Withermarsh, sir.

38:47.492 --> 38:50.494
By Jove, yes! So it is.

38:50.578 --> 38:52.579
Well, I'll see what he wants.

39:05.927 --> 39:09.263
It be the Colonel. The old boy himself!

39:09.389 --> 39:10.848
He wants the message.

39:10.932 --> 39:14.560
You'd better make it loud
and clear or he'll never get it.

39:19.607 --> 39:22.526
One long howl, two short.

39:22.610 --> 39:24.862
- One yip and a woof.
- Two yips, sir.

39:24.946 --> 39:27.698
- What's the word, Colonel?
- It's from London.

39:27.782 --> 39:29.199
Then it must be important.

39:29.284 --> 39:31.869
Yes, yes, I'll get the rest of it.

39:46.301 --> 39:49.887
Sounds like a number.
Three fives are 13...

39:49.971 --> 39:51.889
That's 15, sir.

39:51.973 --> 39:53.932
Fifteen, of course 15.

39:56.644 --> 40:00.064
Yes, dot, spot, spotted puddings,

40:00.148 --> 40:01.774
poodles...

40:02.650 --> 40:05.235
No, no, puddles.

40:05.320 --> 40:06.570
Puddles, sir?

40:06.654 --> 40:09.573
Fifteen spotted puddles stolen.

40:09.657 --> 40:11.658
Oh, balderdash.

40:15.246 --> 40:16.955
Better double check it, Colonel.

40:18.958 --> 40:21.293
Oh, yes, yes, I suppose I better.

40:29.010 --> 40:31.595
Two woofs, one yip and a woof.

40:31.679 --> 40:33.263
It sounds like puppies, sir.

40:33.348 --> 40:35.265
Of course, puppies.

40:35.350 --> 40:37.434
Colonel, Colonel, sir,
I just remembered.

40:37.519 --> 40:40.270
Two nights past I heard puppy
barking over at Hell Hall.

40:40.355 --> 40:42.940
You mean the old De Vil place?

40:43.024 --> 40:45.609
Nonsense, Tibs!
No one's lived there for years.

40:45.693 --> 40:48.946
Hold on! There's smoke
coming from the chimney!

40:49.030 --> 40:53.784
By Jove, that's strange, strange indeed.

40:54.285 --> 40:56.787
I suppose we'd better investigate.

40:56.871 --> 40:59.706
I'll send word for ol' Towser to stand by.

41:03.711 --> 41:06.630
Please stand by.

41:06.714 --> 41:09.883
- What's he mean by that?
- I don't know.

41:10.009 --> 41:12.302
Oh, maybe the ol' boy's
found something!

41:12.387 --> 41:15.514
Oh, I do hope so.

41:21.062 --> 41:25.649
They say the ol' place is haunted or
bewitched or some such fiddle-faddle.

41:25.733 --> 41:27.651
Fiddle-faddle and rot, sir.

41:27.735 --> 41:30.320
Just the same, use extreme caution.

41:30.405 --> 41:32.990
No telling what sort of
hocus-pocus you might run into.

41:36.077 --> 41:38.662
Blast it all, Tibs. On the double, man.

41:38.746 --> 41:41.748
- On the double.
- Yes, sir. Right away, sir.

42:22.290 --> 42:25.876
- Rover. Spotty.
- What?

42:25.960 --> 42:27.878
Are you one of the 15 stolen puppies?

42:27.962 --> 42:31.465
No, we're not stolen.
We're bought and paid for.

42:31.591 --> 42:33.300
There's 99 of us all together.

42:34.594 --> 42:36.637
Ninety-nine!

42:42.977 --> 42:45.395
How 'bout that bunch of little ones?

42:45.480 --> 42:48.899
They have names and collars.
They're not from the pet shops.

42:48.983 --> 42:51.401
- Fifteen of 'em.
- We never counted them.

42:51.486 --> 42:53.612
They're over there by the TV.

42:59.994 --> 43:02.579
- I'd better count 'em.
- Watch out for the Baduns.

43:02.664 --> 43:03.914
Baduns?

43:03.998 --> 43:06.333
Those two blokes, Horace and Jasper.

43:06.417 --> 43:08.669
They're mean ones, they are.

43:16.678 --> 43:18.845
Hey, look, Horace!

43:18.972 --> 43:22.474
Watch me pot His Lordship
smack on the conk.

43:24.852 --> 43:27.271
How's that for calling 'em, eh?

43:31.276 --> 43:32.776
One, two,

43:32.860 --> 43:36.446
- three, four, five, six...
- Hey, Jasper.

43:36.531 --> 43:40.450
Come on, now, give us a swig,

43:40.535 --> 43:42.119
just a short one.

43:42.203 --> 43:46.290
Now, Horace, this hogwash ain't fit
for a fancy bloke like yourself.

43:46.374 --> 43:49.543
Besides, you'd get crumbs in it,
you cabbage head!

43:50.503 --> 43:52.462
All right.

43:52.547 --> 43:57.217
Guzzle the whole works. I hope
it gives you collywobbles, that's what.

44:02.348 --> 44:05.892
Hey, Jasper. Did you...

44:07.395 --> 44:10.314
Let me see.
Six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11...

44:10.398 --> 44:13.650
Hey, get down, you runt!

44:13.735 --> 44:15.527
And stay down!

44:18.072 --> 44:19.990
Go on, get out of here

44:20.074 --> 44:21.992
or I'll black your other peeper.

44:22.076 --> 44:25.329
Where was I? Nine...

44:25.413 --> 44:28.081
Nine, three more.

44:28.166 --> 44:32.336
Twelve and... One, two, three.
That's 15!

44:32.420 --> 44:35.047
They're the ones!

44:37.759 --> 44:39.760
Blimey!

44:39.886 --> 44:41.345
What the...

44:41.429 --> 44:45.098
Horace, look what we got! A tabby cat!

44:50.521 --> 44:53.023
How'd you like a tabby cat stew?

44:53.107 --> 44:55.442
Or a cat casserole?

44:57.028 --> 44:59.112
Ã€ la mode.

45:22.804 --> 45:26.640
- What is it, Pongo? What is it?
- It's the Great Dane.

45:26.766 --> 45:30.060
He has news for us.
He'll meet us at Primrose Hill.

45:30.144 --> 45:33.397
- How'll we get out?
- The back bedroom window.

45:33.481 --> 45:35.982
It's always open a wee bit. Come on.

45:42.657 --> 45:44.408
Pongos, you've made it. Good.

45:44.492 --> 45:48.078
- What's the word? What's the news?
- Have they found our puppies?

45:48.162 --> 45:50.914
They've been located
somewhere north of here,

45:50.998 --> 45:53.166
- in Suffolk.
- Oh, thank heaven.

45:53.292 --> 45:56.253
- Can you leave tonight?
- We can leave right away.

45:56.337 --> 46:00.507
I'll go along as far as Camden Road
and give you instructions.

46:08.433 --> 46:11.435
When you reach Withermarsh,
contact old Towser.

46:11.519 --> 46:14.438
He'll direct you to the Colonel
and the Colonel will take you

46:14.522 --> 46:16.440
to your puppies at the De Vil place.

46:16.524 --> 46:19.359
- De Vil!
- The De Vil place!

46:19.485 --> 46:22.362
Oh, Pongo, it was her!

46:22.488 --> 46:23.864
Oh, someone you know?

46:23.990 --> 46:26.491
Sorry, sir. There's no time to explain.

46:28.161 --> 46:30.704
Oh, I hope we're not too late.

46:30.830 --> 46:34.124
Good luck, Pongos.

46:34.208 --> 46:38.211
If you lose your way,
contact the barking chain.

46:38.296 --> 46:40.797
They'll be standing by!

47:57.083 --> 47:58.458
Any news, Colonel?

47:58.584 --> 48:00.460
Not a blasted thing.

48:00.545 --> 48:03.797
They're lost or captured,
or something or other.

48:03.923 --> 48:06.633
- Who knows what.
- Colonel, here comes a car.

48:06.717 --> 48:08.969
Come now, Tibs. Don't be ridiculous.

48:09.095 --> 48:11.388
- They wouldn't be driving.
- Yes, I know, sir.

48:11.472 --> 48:13.431
But it's heading for Hell Hall.

48:14.976 --> 48:18.061
It's stopping at the gate!

48:18.145 --> 48:22.065
It is? Blast it all! Better see what's up.

48:22.149 --> 48:24.651
- On the double, man. On the double!
- Yes, sir.

48:26.904 --> 48:28.238
Take over, Captain.

48:28.322 --> 48:30.323
Right-o, sir.

48:35.621 --> 48:38.915
I'm sorry, Mr Simpkins.
The answer's no, no, no.

48:39.000 --> 48:41.334
Six down, four to go.

48:41.460 --> 48:45.672
I've got no time to argue.
It's got to be done tonight.

48:45.798 --> 48:49.426
It must be a yes
or no question, Inspector.

48:49.510 --> 48:51.761
Do you understand? Tonight!

48:51.846 --> 48:53.763
But they ain't big enough.

48:53.848 --> 48:56.766
You couldn't get half a dozen
coats out of the whole caboodle.

48:56.851 --> 48:59.102
Coats! Dog-skin coats?

48:59.186 --> 49:01.771
Then we'll settle for half a dozen!
We can't wait.

49:01.856 --> 49:05.692
The police are everywhere.
I want the job done tonight!

49:05.776 --> 49:07.861
How're we gonna do it?

49:07.945 --> 49:10.530
Any way you like.
Poison them, drown them.

49:10.656 --> 49:13.700
Bash them in the head.
You got any chloroform?

49:13.826 --> 49:16.369
- Not a drop.
- And no ether, ei-ther.

49:16.495 --> 49:18.038
Eye-ther!

49:18.164 --> 49:22.375
I don't care how you kill the little beasts,
but do it, and do it now!

49:22.460 --> 49:25.712
Please, miss. Have pity.

49:25.838 --> 49:28.298
Can't we see the rest of the show first?

49:28.382 --> 49:30.842
We want to see What's My Crime?

49:38.976 --> 49:40.644
Listen, you idiots!

49:40.728 --> 49:43.980
I'll be back in the morning.
The job better be done,

49:44.065 --> 49:46.399
or I'll call the police!

49:47.568 --> 49:50.570
Do you understand?

49:57.745 --> 49:59.412
I think she means it.

49:59.497 --> 50:02.415
We'll get on with it,

50:02.500 --> 50:05.502
as soon as the show's over.

50:07.338 --> 50:08.755
Will you please sign in, sir?

50:12.093 --> 50:15.595
You'd better get out of here
if you want to save your skins.

50:15.680 --> 50:17.263
But how?

50:17.390 --> 50:20.433
There's a hole in the wall
there by the door.

50:21.268 --> 50:23.853
Come on, shake a leg.

50:23.938 --> 50:26.022
Kids, follow me.

50:26.107 --> 50:29.359
Hey, Jasper, look!

50:29.443 --> 50:31.444
It's old Meathead.

50:31.529 --> 50:36.866
Yeah, what do you know,
old Meathead Fauncewater.

50:37.868 --> 50:39.285
Come on, don't crowd.

50:40.788 --> 50:42.872
One at a time. One at a time!

50:42.957 --> 50:45.458
For our last contestant,

50:45.543 --> 50:48.461
meet Mr Percival Fauncewater.

50:48.587 --> 50:53.550
If the panel fails to guess
your unusual crime in ten questions,

50:53.634 --> 50:57.137
you will receive two weeks
vacation at a seaside resort,

50:57.221 --> 50:59.305
all expenses paid.

50:59.432 --> 51:03.810
That is, after you've paid
your debt to society.

51:06.147 --> 51:09.733
Who will take the first question?
Inspector?

51:09.817 --> 51:13.236
Mr Fauncewater, could your crime
be classified as larceny?

51:13.320 --> 51:15.822
- A theft, burglary?
- Straighten out!

51:15.906 --> 51:19.576
Form a queue, along the wall.
Snap it up, faster.

51:19.660 --> 51:22.245
Mr Fauncewater is a burglar by trade,

51:22.329 --> 51:24.581
but in this case,
his crime was not burglary.

51:24.665 --> 51:26.750
The answer's no. One down,

51:26.834 --> 51:29.002
nine to go. Miss Birdwell?

51:29.128 --> 51:32.338
If your crime wasn't robbery, did you,

51:32.423 --> 51:35.341
oh, dear, what I mean is,

51:35.426 --> 51:38.261
do something of a violent nature,
that is...

51:38.345 --> 51:40.764
Come, Miss Birdwell,
we're running short of time.

51:40.848 --> 51:44.851
So sorry. Did you do someone in?

51:44.935 --> 51:48.104
No, Miss Birdwell, I'm sorry.
The answer is no.

51:48.189 --> 51:50.273
Two down, eight to go.

51:50.357 --> 51:52.609
Mr Simpkins?

51:52.693 --> 51:55.779
Hey, kid, let's go.

51:55.863 --> 52:00.450
Could it be
a violation of a city ordinance?

52:00.534 --> 52:02.869
No. The answer is...

52:02.953 --> 52:06.122
Hey, get out of the way, you little runt!

52:06.207 --> 52:09.209
Three down, seven to go. Inspector?

52:09.335 --> 52:12.629
Very confusing, I must say.

52:12.713 --> 52:15.381
Surely, this crime could...

52:15.508 --> 52:18.551
I'm terribly sorry.
We've run out of time.

52:18.636 --> 52:21.721
Ain't that always the way!

52:21.847 --> 52:24.140
Would it be possible
for Mr Fauncewater

52:24.225 --> 52:25.642
to come back next week?

52:25.726 --> 52:28.144
Then we could finish our little game.

52:28.229 --> 52:32.398
Good night, audience.
See you next week at this same time

52:32.525 --> 52:34.901
on What's My Crime?

52:36.320 --> 52:38.238
Oh, well.

52:39.240 --> 52:41.074
Come on, Horace. Let's get on with it.

52:43.369 --> 52:45.662
I'll pop 'em on the head,
you do the skinnin'.

52:45.746 --> 52:48.581
No, you don't, Jasper!

52:48.707 --> 52:51.417
I'll pop 'em off and you do the skinnin'.

52:53.212 --> 52:55.421
Horace, look!

52:55.548 --> 52:59.008
They're gone. They flew the coop,

52:59.093 --> 53:02.011
right out through this hole.
Here, grab a torch.

53:02.096 --> 53:04.848
We'll run 'em down before
you can say "Bob's your uncle."

53:13.065 --> 53:15.441
There they go, Horace, up the stairs.

53:19.113 --> 53:20.613
Here, puppies.

53:24.743 --> 53:26.452
Here, puppies! Come on now.

53:26.579 --> 53:28.413
Don't go hiding from ol' Uncle Jasper.

53:32.251 --> 53:34.127
Oh, I ain't gonna hurt ya.

53:34.211 --> 53:35.962
I thought we was gonna pop 'em off.

53:36.088 --> 53:38.047
Shut up.

53:38.132 --> 53:41.634
Take a squint in there.
I'll check these other two rooms.

53:42.720 --> 53:45.805
Here, puppies.

53:47.808 --> 53:50.226
Puppies, come on out.
Come out wherever you are.

53:52.062 --> 53:54.147
Horace!

53:54.231 --> 53:57.150
It's that mangy tabby cat!
He's the ringleader!

53:58.110 --> 54:00.153
Head 'em off, Horace! Head 'em...

54:04.909 --> 54:07.243
You bungling blockhead!

54:08.662 --> 54:10.246
Back here! Back here!

54:11.916 --> 54:15.126
Here they come.

54:15.210 --> 54:18.171
Double-crossin' little twerps,
pulling a snitch on us!

54:18.297 --> 54:22.008
After we took care of 'em.
There's gratitude for you.

54:22.134 --> 54:23.635
It ain't fair, Jasper.

54:27.306 --> 54:29.974
Horace, there they go!

54:32.394 --> 54:34.520
Sergeant? I say, Sergeant.

54:34.647 --> 54:37.398
No time to explain. Busy, sir.

54:44.198 --> 54:45.823
Shut that door, Horace!

54:47.534 --> 54:50.870
We'll close in on 'em.
Enough of this Ring Around the Rosy.

54:57.920 --> 55:01.714
Oh, Pongo, I'm afraid we're lost.

55:01.840 --> 55:04.842
It can't be far.

55:06.178 --> 55:10.014
By Jove! It can't be the Pongos.

55:20.526 --> 55:22.235
It's the Colonel. This way.

55:29.284 --> 55:31.536
Colonel? Are you the Colonel?

55:31.620 --> 55:34.372
Oh, Pingo! Pongo?

55:34.456 --> 55:37.000
Our puppies, are they all right?

55:37.084 --> 55:39.293
No time to explain. There's trouble.

55:39.420 --> 55:42.547
A big hullabaloo. Come along!

55:42.631 --> 55:44.298
Follow me!

55:47.428 --> 55:51.431
Now we've got 'em, Horace.
They've run out of room.

55:53.225 --> 55:55.768
What have we got here?
A couple of spotted hyenas?

55:55.894 --> 55:58.855
Come on, Horace. Give 'em what for.

55:58.939 --> 56:00.648
I'm right behind ya, lad.

56:02.443 --> 56:05.319
You clumsy clod!

56:05.446 --> 56:10.324
Hey! I'll knock the spots off you. Let go!

56:10.451 --> 56:12.452
Let go!

56:16.915 --> 56:19.083
Well, by George!

56:27.593 --> 56:29.761
You mangy mongrel!

56:31.764 --> 56:34.265
I'll knock your blinkin' block off.

56:37.978 --> 56:40.813
Blast 'em, Tibs. Give 'em what for.

56:40.939 --> 56:43.149
No, Colonel. Retreat, retreat!

56:43.275 --> 56:45.818
Yes. Yes, of course. Retreat!

56:45.944 --> 56:47.612
Retreat, on the double!

56:52.159 --> 56:55.703
Help, Jasper! Get me out of here!

56:55.829 --> 56:58.498
Horace, they're fighting dirty!

57:08.175 --> 57:10.051
Jasper!

57:10.177 --> 57:12.470
Horace!

57:21.688 --> 57:23.856
Come on, Perdy. Let's go.

57:29.321 --> 57:31.864
I'll skin every one
of them spotted hyenas

57:31.990 --> 57:34.659
if it's the last thing I do.

57:36.662 --> 57:37.703
Dad! Mother!

57:39.540 --> 57:41.666
- I missed you, Mommy.
- Here we are, Mommy.

57:41.834 --> 57:44.293
Oh, my darlings, my darlings!

57:44.378 --> 57:45.670
How'd you find us, Dad?

57:45.754 --> 57:48.965
Lucky, Patch, Pepper!

57:49.049 --> 57:50.299
Hi, Freckles.

57:50.384 --> 57:51.634
Oh, Daddy.

57:51.718 --> 57:53.302
And Rolly, you rascal!

57:53.387 --> 57:55.805
Did you bring me anything to eat?

57:55.889 --> 57:58.349
Everybody here? All 15?

57:58.433 --> 58:01.727
Twice that many, Dad.
Now there's 99 of us!

58:01.854 --> 58:04.981
What? Ninety-nine?

58:05.065 --> 58:06.983
Where did they all come from?

58:07.067 --> 58:09.986
What would she want with so many?

58:10.070 --> 58:11.988
She's gonna make coats out of us.

58:12.072 --> 58:15.658
- She couldn't!
- That's right, dog-skin coats.

58:15.742 --> 58:19.662
Oh, dog-skin coats! Come now, Tibs!

58:19.746 --> 58:21.664
But it's true, sir.

58:21.748 --> 58:25.334
Horace and Jasper were gonna
pop us off and skin us!

58:25.419 --> 58:28.921
She's a devil, a witch! What'll we do?

58:29.047 --> 58:31.757
We have to get back
to London somehow.

58:31.884 --> 58:35.595
What about the others?
What'll they do?

58:35.721 --> 58:38.431
Perdy, we'll take them
home with us, all of them.

58:38.557 --> 58:40.975
Our pets would never turn them out.

58:41.101 --> 58:44.187
Colonel, sir, lights on the road.

58:44.271 --> 58:46.147
It's a truck headin' this way.

58:46.273 --> 58:48.316
It's the Baduns, Horace and Jasper.

58:48.442 --> 58:49.942
They're following our tracks.

58:50.068 --> 58:52.612
We've got 'em outnumbered, Tibs.

58:52.738 --> 58:55.281
When I give the signal, we'll attack.

58:55.407 --> 58:58.284
Colonel, sir, I'm afraid
that would be disastrous.

58:58.410 --> 59:00.453
Oh, you think so?

59:00.579 --> 59:02.288
He's right. We'd better run for it.

59:02.414 --> 59:04.582
Out the back way, across the pasture.

59:04.666 --> 59:06.584
Thank you, Sergeant, Colonel, Captain.

59:06.668 --> 59:09.629
- Bless you all.
- How can we ever repay you?

59:09.755 --> 59:13.299
Nothing at all. All in the line of duty.

59:13.425 --> 59:15.635
That's right, sir, routine.

59:15.761 --> 59:17.762
Better be off. Here they come.

59:20.807 --> 59:22.683
Come on, kids, hurry.

59:22.809 --> 59:26.312
- Good luck, Pongos.
- And never fear.

59:26.438 --> 59:28.314
We'll hold them off 'til the bitter end.

59:32.319 --> 59:33.653
Now, what's this?

59:33.779 --> 59:35.988
Out of my way, you barkin' haystack.

59:36.114 --> 59:37.990
Or I'll knock your blinkin' block off!

59:43.622 --> 59:45.665
They ain't in here, Jasper.

59:45.791 --> 59:48.668
They're hiding in the hay.

59:48.794 --> 59:51.337
Give me a match. We'll burn 'em out.

59:51.463 --> 59:54.340
Ready, Captain. Aim.

59:54.466 --> 59:55.800
Fire one.

59:58.804 --> 01:00:00.471
Fire two.

01:00:04.184 --> 01:00:07.395
Hey, there they go, the little sneaks.

01:00:07.521 --> 01:00:11.148
Come on, back to the truck.
We'll head 'em off in half a mile.

01:00:19.491 --> 01:00:21.701
They gotta be around here somewhere.

01:00:21.827 --> 01:00:25.371
- I've been thinkin'.
- Now, Horace.

01:00:25.497 --> 01:00:28.541
What if they went down
the froze-up creek,

01:00:28.667 --> 01:00:31.377
so's not to leave their tracks?

01:00:31.503 --> 01:00:33.587
Horace, you idiot!

01:00:33.714 --> 01:00:36.924
Dogs ain't that smart.

01:00:46.560 --> 01:00:48.102
All clear, Perdy.

01:00:48.228 --> 01:00:53.024
- All clear.
- We gave 'em the slip! Didn't we, Dad?

01:00:53.108 --> 01:00:55.693
They didn't even see us, Patch!

01:00:55.777 --> 01:00:59.739
Children. Children.

01:01:11.877 --> 01:01:13.961
My feet are slippery.

01:01:14.087 --> 01:01:17.381
I wish we could walk on the snow.

01:01:17.466 --> 01:01:20.259
No, son, we can't leave tracks.

01:01:41.156 --> 01:01:43.324
Well, any sign of them?

01:01:43.450 --> 01:01:46.202
Not so much as one bloomin' footprint.

01:01:46.286 --> 01:01:49.580
And we've been up and down
every road in the county.

01:01:49.664 --> 01:01:52.500
We're froze stiff. We're givin' up.

01:01:52.626 --> 01:01:54.877
Oh, no, you don't!

01:01:54.961 --> 01:01:58.422
We'll find the little mongrels
if it takes till next Christmas.

01:01:58.507 --> 01:02:01.133
Now get going! Watch your driving,

01:02:01.259 --> 01:02:04.929
you imbeciles! Do you wanna
get nabbed by the police?

01:02:31.456 --> 01:02:33.749
Ninety-three,

01:02:33.834 --> 01:02:36.669
94, 95, 96,

01:02:38.505 --> 01:02:40.673
97,

01:02:40.799 --> 01:02:42.508
98...

01:02:42.634 --> 01:02:45.010
Oh, Lucky!

01:02:47.472 --> 01:02:50.015
Come on, Lucky, boy.
We can't give up now.

01:02:50.142 --> 01:02:54.854
I'm tired and I'm hungry
and my tail's froze,

01:02:54.980 --> 01:02:59.191
and my nose is froze
and my ears are froze.

01:02:59.317 --> 01:03:01.652
And my toes are froze.

01:03:03.864 --> 01:03:05.656
Pongo!

01:03:06.992 --> 01:03:09.535
Pongo! Pongo!

01:03:09.661 --> 01:03:13.205
We'd just about lost hope.
We have shelter for you,

01:03:13.331 --> 01:03:16.000
at the dairy barn across the road.

01:03:17.127 --> 01:03:18.627
Oh, thank goodness.

01:03:18.712 --> 01:03:21.046
Perdy! Perdy!

01:03:22.966 --> 01:03:24.717
This way, Perdy.

01:03:24.843 --> 01:03:27.720
- The dairy barn across the road.
- Come on, kids.

01:03:34.227 --> 01:03:37.354
It's not far. Come on, this way.
Follow the collie.

01:04:02.172 --> 01:04:03.756
Just look, Queenie.

01:04:03.882 --> 01:04:07.927
- Have you ever seen so many puppies?
- Aren't they adorable!

01:04:08.053 --> 01:04:10.930
- Perfectly darling.
- The poor dears.

01:04:11.056 --> 01:04:15.184
They're completely worn out
and half frozen!

01:04:15.519 --> 01:04:17.770
They all here, Pongo?

01:04:18.188 --> 01:04:20.981
Yes, dear. All 99 accounted for.

01:04:21.066 --> 01:04:25.528
The famous Pongos.
We were so worried about you.

01:04:25.612 --> 01:04:28.614
Been trying to reach you.
Afraid you'd been captured.

01:04:28.740 --> 01:04:31.200
How did you make it all this way?

01:04:31.284 --> 01:04:35.621
- And in such dreadful weather.
- With all those little ones.

01:04:35.705 --> 01:04:38.624
I'm hungry, Mother. I'm hungry.

01:04:38.750 --> 01:04:43.128
- I'm hungry, too.
- Mother, we're hungry.

01:04:43.213 --> 01:04:47.383
- We're all hungry.
- I'm sorry, children.

01:04:47.467 --> 01:04:50.386
Do they like warm milk? It's fresh.

01:04:50.470 --> 01:04:53.556
- Where is it?
- Where is the milk?

01:04:53.640 --> 01:04:56.308
Come and get it, kids. It's on the house.

01:04:56.434 --> 01:04:58.811
This way, children. Around this way.

01:05:00.438 --> 01:05:02.731
Don't crowd. You'll have to take turns.

01:05:06.319 --> 01:05:08.946
Rolly, wait your turn, dear.

01:05:12.158 --> 01:05:14.994
Don't worry, kids. There's plenty for all.

01:05:15.078 --> 01:05:18.414
The little darlings.

01:05:18.498 --> 01:05:22.418
Pongo, a few scraps I saved

01:05:22.502 --> 01:05:25.421
- for you and the missus.
- Oh, thank you.

01:05:25.505 --> 01:05:28.591
It's not much, but it might
hold you as far as Dinsford.

01:05:28.675 --> 01:05:30.759
Huh? Dinsford?

01:05:30.844 --> 01:05:34.513
There's a Labrador there.
His pet is a grocer.

01:05:35.807 --> 01:05:37.766
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.

01:05:37.851 --> 01:05:39.435
Quite all right.

01:05:39.519 --> 01:05:43.522
Get some rest and don't worry.
I'll be standing watch.

01:05:45.525 --> 01:05:47.776
I don't know what we'd have done if...

01:05:47.861 --> 01:05:52.448
- We're honoured to be of service.
- We're sorry we can't do more.

01:05:52.532 --> 01:05:56.201
Anyone who would think
of hurting these puppies...

01:05:56.328 --> 01:05:59.788
- Duchess!
- They're so dear.

01:05:59.873 --> 01:06:02.958
I wish they could stay
with us for always.

01:06:03.043 --> 01:06:06.045
Princess! Quiet, everyone.

01:06:06.129 --> 01:06:08.797
Let them sleep, the poor things.

01:06:08.882 --> 01:06:14.511
They're so exhausted and they still
have such a long way to go.

01:06:51.966 --> 01:06:54.343
Hurry, kids. Hurry!

01:07:14.072 --> 01:07:17.408
Well now, what have we here?

01:07:19.077 --> 01:07:23.247
Well, so they thought
they could outwit Cruella.

01:07:26.209 --> 01:07:28.419
Jasper! Horace!

01:07:31.881 --> 01:07:34.258
Here's their tracks
heading for the village.

01:07:34.342 --> 01:07:37.261
Blimey! It's them, all right.

01:07:37.345 --> 01:07:40.597
Work your way south on the side roads.
I'll take the main road.

01:07:40.682 --> 01:07:43.350
See you in Dinsford!

01:08:00.702 --> 01:08:03.954
Pongo, I've got a ride home for you.

01:08:04.038 --> 01:08:07.624
A ride home? Perdy, did you hear that?

01:08:07.709 --> 01:08:08.959
For all of us?

01:08:09.043 --> 01:08:10.961
You mean we don't have
to walk any more?

01:08:11.045 --> 01:08:14.465
If we can manage it. We'd better hurry.

01:08:14.549 --> 01:08:18.051
We've got a ride home!
Come on, children.

01:08:24.975 --> 01:08:27.519
See the van down the street?

01:08:27.604 --> 01:08:30.647
It's going to London
as soon as the engine's repaired.

01:08:30.732 --> 01:08:33.609
And there's room for all of you.

01:08:33.693 --> 01:08:36.944
Pongo, there's Cruella.

01:08:47.499 --> 01:08:48.874
Yes,

01:08:48.957 --> 01:08:51.210
and Jasper and Horace.

01:08:51.294 --> 01:08:54.712
Pongo, how will we get to the van?

01:08:54.798 --> 01:08:56.256
I don't know, Perdy.

01:08:56.341 --> 01:08:58.466
But somehow we've got to.

01:08:58.551 --> 01:09:00.260
Mother, Dad,

01:09:00.345 --> 01:09:03.639
- Patch pushed me in the fireplace.
- Lucky pushed me first.

01:09:03.723 --> 01:09:06.265
- Did not. Did not.
- Did, too. Did, too.

01:09:06.350 --> 01:09:08.100
Did not!

01:09:08.520 --> 01:09:12.231
- Please, children, don't quarrel.
- Say...

01:09:12.314 --> 01:09:15.943
Perdy, I've got an idea.

01:09:17.987 --> 01:09:20.572
Pongo, what on earth...

01:09:20.657 --> 01:09:22.573
Look, I'm a Labrador!

01:09:22.658 --> 01:09:25.702
We'll all roll in soot. We'll be Labradors.

01:09:25.787 --> 01:09:27.412
Say, that is an idea!

01:09:27.497 --> 01:09:30.415
Come on, kids! Roll in the soot.

01:09:30.500 --> 01:09:33.085
You mean, you want us to get dirty?

01:09:33.169 --> 01:09:36.421
Did you hear that, Freckles?
Dad wants us to get dirty.

01:09:36.506 --> 01:09:40.466
- Mother, should we?
- Do as your father says.

01:09:40.551 --> 01:09:44.805
- This'll be fun.
- I always wanted to get good and dirty.

01:09:48.393 --> 01:09:50.769
That's the stuff. The blacker the better.

01:09:50.854 --> 01:09:52.895
- I'm ready.
- Me, too.

01:09:52.981 --> 01:09:54.648
How's this, Dad?

01:09:54.732 --> 01:09:57.442
Wait. That's enough.
Not too many at a time.

01:09:57.527 --> 01:10:00.696
Rolly, hold on. You're only half done.

01:10:01.531 --> 01:10:04.616
Now, stay right with me.

01:10:07.495 --> 01:10:10.497
We're gonna fool the ol' mad lady.

01:10:19.215 --> 01:10:21.466
Pongo,

01:10:21.551 --> 01:10:22.885
I'm so afraid.

01:10:24.554 --> 01:10:26.638
Look, Jasper.

01:10:26.723 --> 01:10:29.850
Do you suppose
they disguised themselves?

01:10:29.934 --> 01:10:34.479
Say now, Horace.
That's just what they did.

01:10:34.564 --> 01:10:38.191
Dogs is always painting
theirselves black!

01:10:38.276 --> 01:10:40.611
You idiot!

01:10:45.283 --> 01:10:47.701
Well, so far so good.

01:10:47.785 --> 01:10:50.287
Come on, Perdy.
Better get on your make-up.

01:10:50.371 --> 01:10:52.414
I'll go ahead with the next bunch.

01:11:03.760 --> 01:11:06.720
Jasper! Horace!

01:11:06.804 --> 01:11:10.265
- Well?
- Now be reasonable, miss.

01:11:10.350 --> 01:11:12.893
We're froze clean to our bones.

01:11:12.977 --> 01:11:16.980
We've been out all night
and all day, with nothin' to eat.

01:11:17.065 --> 01:11:21.109
They're somewhere in this village,
and we're going to find them.

01:11:21.194 --> 01:11:23.153
Now get going!

01:11:26.366 --> 01:11:29.826
Do you think they've seen us?

01:11:29.911 --> 01:11:32.496
No, but we're running out of time.

01:11:32.580 --> 01:11:34.831
Try 'er again, mate.

01:11:34.916 --> 01:11:38.585
Hurry, Perdy. The van's about to leave.

01:11:44.092 --> 01:11:45.968
Better hurry.

01:12:06.864 --> 01:12:08.448
I'll get the rest.

01:12:08.533 --> 01:12:11.451
That ought to do her.
She'll get you back to London.

01:12:11.536 --> 01:12:14.079
Better get aboard, miss.

01:12:18.543 --> 01:12:21.545
Hey, Jasper.

01:12:28.845 --> 01:12:30.887
Come on, Horace.

01:12:36.019 --> 01:12:37.352
Hurry, kids!

01:12:45.903 --> 01:12:48.405
Come on, kids. Run on ahead.

01:12:50.408 --> 01:12:55.120
- She's watching us, Dad.
- Keep going.

01:13:03.421 --> 01:13:05.672
It can't be!

01:13:06.299 --> 01:13:08.091
It's impossible!

01:13:11.888 --> 01:13:14.181
Run for it!

01:13:14.265 --> 01:13:16.725
Jasper! Horace!

01:13:17.727 --> 01:13:19.853
Jasper!

01:13:22.648 --> 01:13:24.941
There they go! In the van.

01:13:25.985 --> 01:13:28.236
After them! After them!

01:13:50.802 --> 01:13:54.471
Pongo! There she is, Cruella.

01:14:01.687 --> 01:14:06.066
Hey, lady, what in thunder
are you tryin' to do?

01:14:06.150 --> 01:14:08.151
Crazy woman driver!

01:14:44.605 --> 01:14:45.647
Pongo, look!

01:14:45.731 --> 01:14:48.316
Jasper!

01:14:48.401 --> 01:14:49.818
Ain't nothin' to it.

01:14:49.902 --> 01:14:51.653
I'll give him a nudge

01:14:51.737 --> 01:14:54.447
and shove him in the dirt.

01:15:07.670 --> 01:15:09.629
Perdy, watch out!

01:15:17.096 --> 01:15:20.640
- Jasper!
- Horace!

01:15:33.029 --> 01:15:35.363
You idiots!

01:15:35.448 --> 01:15:38.450
You fools!

01:15:38.534 --> 01:15:41.786
You imbeciles!

01:15:41.871 --> 01:15:44.372
Shut up!

01:15:46.334 --> 01:15:48.543
You've seen her kind of eyes

01:15:48.628 --> 01:15:52.297
Watching you
from underneath a rock

01:15:53.299 --> 01:15:55.717
Cruella De Vil

01:15:55.801 --> 01:15:57.469
Cruella De

01:15:59.138 --> 01:16:02.265
Roger, after all, that's your first big hit.

01:16:02.350 --> 01:16:04.351
It's made more money
than we ever dreamed of.

01:16:05.228 --> 01:16:06.436
Yes, I know.

01:16:07.230 --> 01:16:12.484
I still can't believe
that Pongo and Perdy would run away.

01:16:12.568 --> 01:16:15.987
Here's a bit of Christmas cheer for you,

01:16:17.240 --> 01:16:19.824
if there's anything to be cheerful about.

01:16:20.826 --> 01:16:23.161
Oh, the dear little things.

01:16:24.997 --> 01:16:29.167
Sometimes at night
I can hear them barking.

01:16:30.920 --> 01:16:33.546
But it always turns out I'm dreaming.

01:16:43.516 --> 01:16:45.392
Roger, what on earth...

01:16:45.518 --> 01:16:46.977
They're Labradors!

01:16:47.061 --> 01:16:49.813
No, no. They're covered with soot.

01:16:49.897 --> 01:16:51.815
Look, here's Lucky!

01:16:51.899 --> 01:16:54.109
Pongo, boy, is that you?

01:16:54.193 --> 01:16:58.697
Oh, Pongo, Pongo! It's Pongo!

01:16:58.781 --> 01:17:00.949
And Perdy, my darling.

01:17:01.033 --> 01:17:03.285
And Patch, and Rolly,

01:17:03.369 --> 01:17:05.370
and Penny, and Freckles.

01:17:05.454 --> 01:17:09.040
They're all here, the little dears.

01:17:09.125 --> 01:17:12.043
- It's a miracle!
- What a wonderful Christmas present!

01:17:12.128 --> 01:17:15.130
And look, there's a whole lot more!

01:17:16.465 --> 01:17:18.758
Look, Anita, puppies everywhere.

01:17:18.884 --> 01:17:20.385
There must be 100!

01:17:20.469 --> 01:17:24.556
One, two, three and four, is seven.

01:17:24.640 --> 01:17:27.892
Two, four, six, and three
is nine, plus two is 11.

01:17:27.977 --> 01:17:31.271
- Thirty-six over here.
- Thirty-six and 11, that's 47!

01:17:31.397 --> 01:17:34.232
- Eighteen, Roger.
- That's 65!

01:17:34.317 --> 01:17:37.360
Ten, 11, 12, 13!

01:17:37.445 --> 01:17:38.903
Wait a minute, six more.

01:17:38.988 --> 01:17:41.573
Let's see, that's 84.

01:17:41.657 --> 01:17:46.202
And 15 plus two, 101!

01:17:46.287 --> 01:17:50.790
A hundred and one?
Where did they come from?

01:17:50.916 --> 01:17:54.794
Oh, Pongo, you old rascal!

01:17:54.920 --> 01:17:57.213
- What'll we do with them?
- We'll keep 'em.

01:17:57.298 --> 01:18:00.258
- In this little house?
- We'll buy a big place in the country.

01:18:01.594 --> 01:18:05.597
We'll have a plantation,
a Dalmatian plantation.

01:18:05.681 --> 01:18:09.100
Roger, that's truly an inspiration.

01:18:09.185 --> 01:18:11.102
It'll be a sensation!

01:18:11.187 --> 01:18:14.356
We'll have a Dalmatian plantation.

01:18:14.440 --> 01:18:16.691
A Dalmatian plantation, I say.

01:18:17.985 --> 01:18:20.570
We'll have a Dalmatian plantation

01:18:20.654 --> 01:18:22.113
Where ourpopulation can roam

01:18:22.198 --> 01:18:23.239
I'm hungry.

01:18:23.324 --> 01:18:26.034
In this new location
Our whole aggregation

01:18:26.118 --> 01:18:28.203
Will love ourplantation home

01:18:39.298 --> 01:18:44.552
Dalmatian plantation home
