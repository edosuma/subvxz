WEBVTT

00:02.500 --> 00:05.250
[dramatic music]

00:08.125 --> 00:12.167
No traffic, no complaints,
no noise.

00:12.250 --> 00:14.875
Traitors, troublemakers, and
ambassadors all tucked snugly

00:14.958 --> 00:17.542
in their little beds.
I love this time of night.

00:17.625 --> 00:20.792
There is no night in deep space
and time's a meaningless concept

00:20.875 --> 00:22.083
when you stop
to think about it.

00:22.167 --> 00:23.667
Commander,
the jumpgate's on-line.

00:23.750 --> 00:25.792
I read six ships.

00:28.458 --> 00:30.333
[crackling]

00:33.000 --> 00:34.417
- They're Earthforce.
- Uh-hm.

00:34.500 --> 00:37.667
I'm receiving a code ten,
ultraviolet docking request.

00:37.750 --> 00:39.125
Inform Captain Sheridan
immediately

00:39.208 --> 00:41.500
and alert the dockers guild.

00:41.583 --> 00:43.208
There's always something.

00:43.292 --> 00:46.333
[dramatic music]

00:59.250 --> 01:00.875
Sir.

01:00.958 --> 01:02.958
Captain John Sheridan,
commander of Babylon 5.

01:03.042 --> 01:04.292
Welcome aboard, sir.

01:04.375 --> 01:08.083
General Richard Franklin,
356th infantry division.

01:08.167 --> 01:09.750
Uh, I'm sorry
for the delay in docking, sir.

01:09.833 --> 01:11.292
No one told us
you were coming.

01:11.375 --> 01:14.667
This operation's classified.
I'll brief you at 0900.

01:14.750 --> 01:16.458
In the meantime,
I'll need billets

01:16.542 --> 01:18.167
for myself and my people.

01:18.250 --> 01:19.917
Just how many people
are we talking, sir?

01:20.000 --> 01:22.000
- Twenty five thousand.
- Twenty five thousand?

01:22.083 --> 01:24.000
I don't have
nearly enough space--

01:24.083 --> 01:26.833
Well, find it.
We'll be here for several days.

01:26.917 --> 01:28.625
And I don't intend
for my troops to be

01:28.708 --> 01:31.333
sitting aboard transports
at all time.

01:31.417 --> 01:32.750
Yes, sir.

01:32.833 --> 01:35.583
Uh, we have a doctor,
Stephen Franklin on station.

01:35.667 --> 01:37.625
- Any relation?
- He's my son.

01:37.708 --> 01:39.833
- I'll let him know you're here.
- That won't be necessary.

01:39.917 --> 01:42.875
I'll attend to it, when I'm
sure that my people are settled.

01:42.958 --> 01:45.958
- You may carry on, captain.
- Yes, sir.

01:46.042 --> 01:49.083
[music continues]

01:50.708 --> 01:52.417
Twenty five thousand.

01:57.333 --> 02:00.042
(Sheridan)
The Babylon Project
was our last

02:00.125 --> 02:02.583
best hope for peace.

02:02.667 --> 02:05.208
A self-contained world
five miles long

02:05.292 --> 02:07.875
located in neutral territory.

02:11.042 --> 02:13.250
A place of commerce
and diplomacy

02:13.333 --> 02:16.958
for a quarter of a million
humans and aliens.

02:17.042 --> 02:20.083
A shining beacon in space

02:20.167 --> 02:22.250
all alone in the night.

02:22.333 --> 02:25.917
It was the dawn of
the Third Age of mankind.

02:26.000 --> 02:29.250
The year of the great war
came upon us all.

02:30.292 --> 02:31.708
This is the story

02:31.792 --> 02:34.292
of the last
of the Babylon stations.

02:34.375 --> 02:36.458
The year is 2259.

02:36.542 --> 02:39.417
The name of the place
is Babylon 5.

02:39.500 --> 02:42.542
[theme music]

03:12.500 --> 03:15.583
[music continues]

03:25.667 --> 03:28.542
[dramatic music]

03:33.208 --> 03:36.250
[indistinct chatter]

03:41.042 --> 03:43.958
Keep it movin', space grunts!

03:44.042 --> 03:45.750
And bite the chatter.

03:45.833 --> 03:47.750
This ain't no church social.

03:47.833 --> 03:49.708
Where the stroking H
you going, Ellison?

03:49.792 --> 03:51.917
You're with green squad.
Step out.

03:52.000 --> 03:54.500
Move up,
keep it rollin'!

03:57.083 --> 03:59.292
[automated message]
'Private, Nazim Ahmed.'

03:59.375 --> 04:02.583
'Serial number 87953.'

04:05.958 --> 04:07.833
'Private, Durman Elizabeth.'

04:07.917 --> 04:10.917
'Serial number 56927.'

04:11.042 --> 04:12.500
Yeah, that's me.

04:13.917 --> 04:15.583
Fall in over there,
someone will take you

04:15.667 --> 04:17.292
to your billet shortly.

04:17.375 --> 04:20.750
We need more personnel up here,
and I mean fast!

04:20.833 --> 04:24.125
Commander, oh, commander.

04:24.208 --> 04:25.500
What the hell is this?

04:25.583 --> 04:27.583
Earthforce calls it
a classified operation.

04:27.667 --> 04:29.000
I call it a nightmare.

04:29.083 --> 04:31.500
Briefing's at 0900,
if we survive all this.

04:31.583 --> 04:33.625
Leave it to the infantry
to ruin's a guy's morning.

04:33.708 --> 04:35.875
Complain later, right now I need
you to seal this area off.

04:35.958 --> 04:38.167
Nobody gets in except
military personnel.

04:38.250 --> 04:39.583
Got it.

04:39.667 --> 04:41.875
Okay, people move it,
keep it orderly.

04:41.958 --> 04:44.042
[music continues]

04:46.208 --> 04:47.667
What's our status?

04:47.750 --> 04:49.333
We've doubled, tripled,
and quadrupled up.

04:49.417 --> 04:51.583
And we're still
400 billets short.

04:51.667 --> 04:53.167
Which is nothing compared
to what this little

04:53.250 --> 04:55.458
surprise has done
to our docking schedule.

04:55.542 --> 04:57.375
Well, if you think
we've got problems now

04:57.458 --> 04:59.000
just wait until
those ground pounders

04:59.083 --> 05:00.708
start hitting the rec area.

05:00.792 --> 05:02.083
Lay on more security.

05:02.167 --> 05:05.083
Post the more colorful spots
off-limits.

05:05.167 --> 05:06.375
I don't want any incidents.

05:06.458 --> 05:07.833
Well, it's already done,
not that I think

05:07.917 --> 05:09.833
it's gonna do us very much good.

05:09.917 --> 05:12.375
You know, if you ask me,
I think someone in Earthdome

05:12.458 --> 05:14.208
has gone completely mental.

05:14.292 --> 05:16.833
(Richard)
That's an interesting opinion.

05:16.917 --> 05:19.167
At ease.

05:19.250 --> 05:22.042
Sir, this is Commander Ivanova,
my second.

05:22.125 --> 05:24.042
Mr. Garibaldi,
chief of security.

05:24.125 --> 05:26.333
I had an Alfredo Garibaldi,
under my command

05:26.417 --> 05:28.000
during the Dilgar invasion.

05:28.083 --> 05:29.542
Excellent soldier.

05:29.625 --> 05:31.458
That was my dad.

05:31.542 --> 05:33.125
So much for genetics.

05:34.333 --> 05:36.333
Now, if you'll all take a seat.

05:36.417 --> 05:37.750
We'll begin.

05:41.333 --> 05:43.375
Frank, if you will.

05:45.333 --> 05:46.667
This is Akdor

05:46.750 --> 05:49.583
'the third planet
in the Shilassen Triumvirate.'

05:49.667 --> 05:51.917
As you're no doubt aware,
Akdor is currently

05:52.000 --> 05:54.458
engaged in a bloody civil war.

05:54.542 --> 05:57.375
The Shilassen government
has asked for aid.

05:57.458 --> 06:00.167
And Earth has agreed
to provide it.

06:00.250 --> 06:02.542
There must be some
mistake, general.

06:02.625 --> 06:05.417
The Shilassen embassy asked me
for aid a week ago.

06:05.500 --> 06:07.250
Earthdome ordered me
to turn them down.

06:07.333 --> 06:09.667
And until the senate
officially announces

06:09.750 --> 06:12.583
our involvement
in the Akdor crisis

06:12.667 --> 06:14.542
those are still your orders.

06:14.625 --> 06:16.667
What exactly is your mission?

06:16.750 --> 06:18.708
Operation sudden death

06:18.792 --> 06:22.625
is a surgical strike on
the rebel stronghold at Matok.

06:22.708 --> 06:26.417
That's why Babylon 5's been
chosen as our staging area.

06:26.500 --> 06:28.667
'It's the closest
earth alliance jumpgate'

06:28.750 --> 06:30.500
'to the Shilassen sector.'

06:30.583 --> 06:32.667
And the senate makes
its announcement

06:32.750 --> 06:36.958
we'll jump immediately and
end the war in one swift move.

06:37.042 --> 06:40.125
With all due respect, general.

06:40.208 --> 06:43.458
I spent time at Matok
during the Kurani expedition.

06:43.542 --> 06:45.458
It's more than just a fortress,
it's a deathtrap.

06:45.542 --> 06:47.875
And that's another reason
for choosing this station.

06:47.958 --> 06:51.458
I'm counting on you to help me
finish planning the assault.

06:51.542 --> 06:55.167
With your knowledge of the
layout and our new weapons

06:55.250 --> 06:58.667
we can catch the rebel leaders
completely by surprise.

06:58.750 --> 07:01.667
Twenty five thousand gropos
aren't exactly inconspicuous.

07:01.750 --> 07:03.833
How do you expect to keep
this little party a secret?

07:03.917 --> 07:07.292
As far as anyone's concerned,
we're relief troops for Io.

07:07.375 --> 07:09.750
Even my own soldiers
don't know any differently.

07:09.833 --> 07:12.042
And by the time
the truth comes out

07:12.125 --> 07:15.417
be
in striking position.

07:15.500 --> 07:17.500
How long before
the announcement is made?

07:17.583 --> 07:19.417
Oh, a few days.

07:19.500 --> 07:22.417
Long enough for us
in place.

07:22.500 --> 07:23.542
Gifts?

07:23.625 --> 07:25.042
(Richard)
'New weapons systems'

07:25.125 --> 07:26.542
'for your defense grid'

07:26.625 --> 07:30.000
'the very latest
from Earthforce R and D.'

07:30.083 --> 07:31.458
When they're online

07:31.542 --> 07:33.708
Babylon 5 will have
enough firepower

07:33.792 --> 07:35.417
to take on a warship.

07:35.500 --> 07:37.750
Are you sure this is wise?

07:37.833 --> 07:41.750
Babylon 5 is supposed
to be devoted to peace.

07:41.833 --> 07:43.375
If we begin arming heavily--

07:43.458 --> 07:45.167
The galaxy's changing, captain

07:45.250 --> 07:48.125
and Babylon 5
must change with it.

07:48.208 --> 07:49.875
With the Narn
and the Centauri at war

07:49.958 --> 07:53.708
the other alien worlds are
bound to become more aggressive

07:53.792 --> 07:56.542
and Earth must keep pace.

07:56.625 --> 07:59.042
And if all doesn't
go well at Matok

07:59.125 --> 08:01.792
my people may need
a fallback position.

08:03.625 --> 08:05.125
My techs will begin installing

08:05.208 --> 08:07.042
the new grid
as soon as possible.

08:07.125 --> 08:09.875
Commander Ivanova
will handle your end.

08:09.958 --> 08:13.000
'I'll meet you here at 1100
to discuss the battle plan.'

08:13.083 --> 08:15.042
And outside of you three..

08:15.125 --> 08:17.542
...no one is to be told of this.

08:19.417 --> 08:21.083
Understood.

08:21.167 --> 08:22.542
Very well.

08:23.917 --> 08:25.375
'Dismissed.'

08:29.500 --> 08:32.000
- This is not good.
- Tell me about it.

08:32.083 --> 08:33.667
What the hell is
Earth Central up to?

08:33.750 --> 08:35.542
Something I hope
we never hear again.

08:35.625 --> 08:38.083
The rattling of sabers.

08:38.167 --> 08:41.208
[whistling]

08:44.917 --> 08:48.667
There we were facing a whole
squad of bonies, I couldn't..

08:48.750 --> 08:50.083
Hey, buddy, how's it hanging?

08:50.167 --> 08:52.542
- I couldn't believe--
- Who are you?

08:52.625 --> 08:54.542
Well, they call me large
and this half-pint rock here

08:54.625 --> 08:55.750
is Yang.

08:55.833 --> 08:56.833
Hey.

08:56.917 --> 08:59.708
What are you doing
in my quarters?

08:59.792 --> 09:01.208
This is where
they assigned us.

09:01.292 --> 09:03.167
Yeah, looks like we're going
to be bunkies for a while.

09:03.250 --> 09:06.083
Here, have a nipper, huh!

09:06.167 --> 09:08.833
Look, I don't know what lame
brain came up with this idea

09:08.917 --> 09:11.542
but there's no way
you two are staying here.

09:13.833 --> 09:15.125
[sighs]

09:25.708 --> 09:27.417
You got some kind
of problem, airboy?

09:27.500 --> 09:28.833
[coughs]

09:29.583 --> 09:31.167
Yeah, I got a problem.

09:31.250 --> 09:32.417
Just give me a minute
to find a ladder

09:32.500 --> 09:34.375
and we'll hash it out
face-to-face.

09:34.458 --> 09:37.292
[intense music]

09:37.375 --> 09:38.792
[laughing]

09:38.875 --> 09:40.792
He's alright,
you alright, baby.

09:40.875 --> 09:43.167
Come on, let's sit down,
that's great.

09:43.250 --> 09:44.708
Sit down.

09:44.792 --> 09:47.500
Here...have a stogie.

09:47.583 --> 09:49.042
[laughing]

09:49.125 --> 09:50.625
So, anyway..

09:50.708 --> 09:52.875
...old Buffer opens up
with the maser

09:52.958 --> 09:54.833
and frags their pointman.

09:54.917 --> 09:56.875
Oh, man, all hell breaks lose.

09:56.958 --> 09:59.000
[dramatic music]

10:00.375 --> 10:03.000
(Stephen)
'So, how are mom and the girls?'

10:03.083 --> 10:07.125
Well, Juanita is due
for a promotion.

10:07.208 --> 10:09.958
Kathy's working
on her third doctorate.

10:10.042 --> 10:12.708
[chuckles]
Good for them.

10:12.792 --> 10:14.417
And Marie and Celia?

10:14.500 --> 10:16.667
Oh, about the same.

10:16.750 --> 10:18.000
If you called your mother
more often

10:18.083 --> 10:20.167
of course, you'd know that.

10:29.417 --> 10:30.708
So..

10:30.792 --> 10:32.000
Do I pass?

10:32.083 --> 10:33.875
Ah, I made sure you could always

10:33.958 --> 10:35.833
spit-shine a billet.

10:38.000 --> 10:40.917
- Here you go.
- Oh, I'm on duty, Stephen.

10:41.000 --> 10:43.750
No, no, no,
this is fruit juice.

10:43.833 --> 10:47.083
The Markab call it Orcha.

10:47.167 --> 10:49.083
You'll like it, go ahead.

10:50.792 --> 10:53.417
No, I like orange juice.

10:53.500 --> 10:54.917
Try it.

11:01.333 --> 11:02.500
Hmm!

11:04.417 --> 11:07.875
So, they got you back
in the saddle again, huh?

11:08.000 --> 11:09.958
Ah, I wouldn't call it
so much of a saddle

11:10.042 --> 11:12.625
it's more like
a coffee and cake run.

11:12.708 --> 11:14.167
Good, good.

11:14.250 --> 11:15.542
Dodging massive explosions

11:15.625 --> 11:17.917
is inimical
to the health at your age.

11:18.000 --> 11:19.333
Mom won't have to worry.

11:19.417 --> 11:22.292
Your mother worries
if I eat a hamburger.

11:22.375 --> 11:25.500
You know what they say
about old soldiers, don't you?

11:25.583 --> 11:28.542
They still kick butt
with the best of 'em.

11:28.625 --> 11:30.375
[laughs]

11:30.458 --> 11:33.083
Whatever happened
to just fading away?

11:33.167 --> 11:36.625
Well, that's not an option
at present.

11:37.750 --> 11:40.833
So, and how are you, Stephen?

11:40.917 --> 11:42.500
Busy.

11:42.583 --> 11:45.417
Babylon 5 is always
bringing me something new.

11:45.500 --> 11:47.083
Well, I suppose that's good.

11:47.167 --> 11:48.708
It's more than good.

11:48.792 --> 11:52.250
This station
is a zenobiologist's dream.

11:52.333 --> 11:54.542
You know, there are over 20
different species of aliens

11:54.625 --> 11:57.792
living on Babylon 5 and more
passing through every day.

11:57.875 --> 12:00.750
I could get you posted
to BethesdaDome.

12:00.833 --> 12:02.958
I mean, with the Narn
and the Centauri at war

12:03.042 --> 12:06.458
they need people with your kind
of knowledge and experience.

12:06.542 --> 12:08.750
here.

12:08.833 --> 12:11.125
I spend time in that type
of research during the last war

12:11.208 --> 12:12.458
remember, I didn't like it.

12:12.542 --> 12:14.042
Like has nothing to do with it.

12:14.125 --> 12:15.750
You have a duty to the force.

12:15.833 --> 12:17.292
What duty, what, what?

12:17.375 --> 12:19.875
Coming up with new and
better ways to wipe out life?

12:19.958 --> 12:21.833
I'm a doctor.
My duty is to heal.

12:21.917 --> 12:24.083
humans.

12:24.167 --> 12:26.000
Stephen, I know
you're fascinated

12:26.083 --> 12:29.875
by these alien creatures but
they're a threat to humanity.

12:29.958 --> 12:31.708
And they always will be.

12:31.792 --> 12:33.292
Help your own kind.

12:33.375 --> 12:35.167
Life is life.

12:35.250 --> 12:38.083
Whether it's wrapped in skin,
scales, or feathers.

12:38.167 --> 12:39.750
Now, if you respected
these beings instead of

12:39.833 --> 12:41.125
constantly trying
to murder them

12:41.208 --> 12:42.708
you'd appreciate that.

12:44.167 --> 12:46.833
I've got to get back
to my duties.

12:46.917 --> 12:48.625
I'll, uh..
Good to see you again.

12:48.708 --> 12:51.625
I'll give your love
to your mother and your sisters.

12:54.958 --> 12:56.375
Damn!

13:07.333 --> 13:08.583
- Dr. Franklin.
- Yes.

13:08.667 --> 13:10.083
We're short of space,
I'm afraid

13:10.167 --> 13:12.167
we're gonna have to billet
these people in the infirmary.

13:12.250 --> 13:13.708
Absolutely not.

13:13.792 --> 13:16.542
This is a medical facility,
not a damn barracks.

13:16.625 --> 13:18.208
Sergeant, would you please
take your people through there

13:18.292 --> 13:19.375
I'll be with you in a minute.

13:19.458 --> 13:21.000
Yes, ma'am.

13:21.083 --> 13:22.958
You heard the commander,
star-butts.

13:23.042 --> 13:24.375
Get it in gear!

13:24.458 --> 13:26.208
Move it, you mutant maggots!

13:26.292 --> 13:28.333
[indistinct chatter]

13:28.417 --> 13:30.125
Earthforce has no right
to come in here

13:30.208 --> 13:31.292
and disrupt my operation.

13:31.375 --> 13:32.625
I have sick people
in those beds.

13:32.708 --> 13:34.042
According to the records,
there are only

13:34.125 --> 13:35.292
three patients in the infirmary.

13:35.375 --> 13:37.208
None of them too ill
to be moved.

13:37.292 --> 13:39.000
Is that your
medical opinion, commander?

13:39.083 --> 13:40.375
No, yours.

13:40.458 --> 13:42.625
Exactly as stated
in the medical log.

13:47.292 --> 13:49.333
'What's the matter
with you, Stephen?'

13:49.417 --> 13:51.417
I've never seen you
like this before.

13:55.000 --> 13:56.583
It's my father.

13:56.667 --> 13:59.625
- The general?
the general.

13:59.708 --> 14:01.625
Old firestorm.

14:01.708 --> 14:03.292
Hero of the Canal Wars

14:03.375 --> 14:05.125
and liberator of
the African block

14:05.208 --> 14:07.250
the scourge of Janos Seven.

14:07.333 --> 14:10.167
- His record is impressive.
- Yes, yes, yes, as a soldier.

14:10.250 --> 14:12.917
But as a father..

14:13.000 --> 14:16.750
...he always brings out this
anger in me I can't control.

14:16.833 --> 14:20.583
No matter how I try, I always
seem to want to hurt him.

14:20.667 --> 14:23.167
You know the funny thing is,
I do love him, I just

14:23.250 --> 14:25.250
can't talk to him.

14:25.333 --> 14:28.542
My father brought out much
the same feelings in me.

14:28.625 --> 14:30.333
I mean, there are so many things
that I wanted to say to him--

14:30.417 --> 14:33.917
- Yeah, I feel the same way..
- Ivanova.

14:34.000 --> 14:36.292
(male #1 on speaker)
'They want you on the dome,
commander.'

14:36.375 --> 14:37.833
On my way.

14:37.917 --> 14:39.583
I, I'm sorry.

14:39.667 --> 14:42.625
We're up to our butts
in jarheads.

14:42.708 --> 14:44.958
Look, I should be free by 1800.

14:45.042 --> 14:46.833
You wanna meet me
at the eclipse?

14:46.917 --> 14:49.167
Yes.

14:49.250 --> 14:51.083
We really do need
that infirmary space.

14:51.167 --> 14:52.792
I will do what I can.

14:52.875 --> 14:54.125
Thanks.

14:58.458 --> 15:01.542
[instrumental music]

15:05.292 --> 15:07.792
In over the years,
I never stopped trying.

15:07.875 --> 15:10.167
But with my father,
it's always the force first

15:10.250 --> 15:13.125
everything else,
a distant second.

15:13.208 --> 15:15.083
When we were kids,
my sisters and I

15:15.167 --> 15:16.667
we weren't treated
like members of the family.

15:16.750 --> 15:18.500
We were treated like soldiers.

15:18.583 --> 15:20.542
And he used to say..

15:20.625 --> 15:22.000
"...you should be
intelligent enough

15:22.083 --> 15:24.500
to let someone else
tell you what to do."

15:24.583 --> 15:26.417
He sounds like a
bit of a tyrant.

15:26.500 --> 15:28.667
Making him the perfect
material for a general.

15:28.750 --> 15:30.000
Exactly.

15:31.500 --> 15:33.292
If you did something wrong..

15:33.375 --> 15:35.667
...or if you
questioned his orders

15:35.750 --> 15:37.417
we were afraid he'd boot you
out of the platoon

15:37.500 --> 15:39.750
and never let you back in.

15:39.833 --> 15:42.167
Of course, that's when
he was there.

15:42.250 --> 15:43.833
And when he wasn't?

15:45.833 --> 15:47.208
There was the waiting.

15:48.708 --> 15:50.333
[sighs]

15:50.417 --> 15:52.250
Terrible waiting.

15:55.250 --> 15:57.458
We'd see newsvids
from the Front.

15:57.542 --> 15:59.833
Wonder whether
he was alive or dead.

16:01.375 --> 16:04.875
After a while
I, I couldn't bear the pain

16:04.958 --> 16:06.917
so I left.

16:07.000 --> 16:09.333
Lost myself out in the stars.

16:10.875 --> 16:14.042
He wasn't happy about it
and didn't talk to me for years.

16:14.125 --> 16:15.708
When I joined Earthforce
during the war

16:15.792 --> 16:17.833
he finally came around,
for a while.

16:17.917 --> 16:19.625
And now?

16:19.708 --> 16:21.125
I don't know.

16:21.208 --> 16:23.250
We don't talk much.

16:23.333 --> 16:25.875
Even when we do, we only end up
hurting each other.

16:27.917 --> 16:30.333
Maybe it's better
I just let it go on.

16:31.708 --> 16:33.708
Talk to him, Stephen.

16:33.792 --> 16:36.708
Tell him what you feel,
no matter how hard it is.

16:36.792 --> 16:39.750
I didn't and I lost the chance.

16:39.833 --> 16:41.625
Don't make the same mistake.

16:41.708 --> 16:44.125
Wait a minute,
w-what are you saying?

16:44.208 --> 16:46.375
These troops are bound for Io,
aren't they?

16:46.458 --> 16:48.500
I have to go back on duty.

16:48.583 --> 16:50.542
No, no.
W-w-wait a minute now.

16:55.333 --> 16:57.833
Mr. Garibaldi, there seems
to be an unusual number

16:57.917 --> 17:01.250
of Earthforce soldiers
about this evening.

17:01.333 --> 17:02.917
They're relief troops
for our colony on Io

17:03.000 --> 17:05.292
came in this morning.
They'll be gone in a few days.

17:05.375 --> 17:07.083
Good, I would not want to think

17:07.167 --> 17:10.250
that Babylon 5
was becoming an armed camp.

17:10.333 --> 17:12.667
The way things are going lately

17:12.750 --> 17:15.083
we need to have some place
devoted to peace.

17:15.167 --> 17:16.417
I take it
there's been no progress

17:16.500 --> 17:18.125
in arranging peace talks.

17:18.208 --> 17:21.125
Londo and G'kar refuse
to even speak to each other.

17:21.208 --> 17:23.708
It is as if they desired
this conflict.

17:23.792 --> 17:26.375
Well, a few hundred years
of bad blood will do that.

17:26.458 --> 17:28.500
We are all slaves
to our histories.

17:28.583 --> 17:31.000
If there is to be a..

17:31.083 --> 17:32.667
...bright future

17:32.750 --> 17:34.458
we must learn
to break those chains.

17:34.542 --> 17:36.458
The only thing you can count
on the Narn and Centauri

17:36.542 --> 17:38.542
to do is
break each other's heads.

17:38.625 --> 17:40.333
I fear you're right.

17:40.417 --> 17:43.458
Still, we must continue trying.

17:43.542 --> 17:46.750
For what it's worth,
I hope you succeed.

17:46.833 --> 17:49.667
If you'll excuse me,
the natives are restless.

17:51.083 --> 17:52.375
[sighs]

17:54.625 --> 17:56.000
Is there something you want?

17:56.083 --> 17:57.167
What are you?

17:57.250 --> 18:00.500
I am a Minbari,
now please let me pass.

18:00.583 --> 18:02.250
Minbari, huh?

18:04.208 --> 18:06.333
Minbari don't have hair.

18:06.417 --> 18:08.458
- This is human hair.
- Let go!

18:09.917 --> 18:11.250
Please.

18:11.333 --> 18:12.292
Please.

18:12.375 --> 18:13.875
I have done nothing to you.

18:13.958 --> 18:16.792
Your people killed my people
on the line bony.

18:16.875 --> 18:20.000
Now you parade around
trying to look human.

18:20.083 --> 18:22.500
What you need is a good lesson.

18:26.750 --> 18:29.042
- Back off, Kliest.
- Get out of my way.

18:29.125 --> 18:30.833
This Minbari freak is
an insult to all of us

18:30.917 --> 18:32.208
and I intend to do
something about it.

18:32.292 --> 18:33.792
In case you haven't heard
the war's over.

18:33.875 --> 18:35.417
Get out of here,
go on, he's drunk.

18:35.500 --> 18:36.833
I'm not finished with her yet.

18:36.917 --> 18:38.833
- Yes, you are!
- Fight, fight, fight!

18:40.792 --> 18:42.583
[grunting]

18:43.583 --> 18:46.625
[people clamoring]

18:50.458 --> 18:51.958
See to it personally.

18:53.042 --> 18:54.542
Mr. Garibaldi.

18:54.625 --> 18:57.667
[grunting]

19:01.125 --> 19:04.500
What the strokin' H
is goin' on here?

19:07.208 --> 19:09.708
Who started this dust-up?

19:14.542 --> 19:16.583
Private Durman.

19:18.958 --> 19:21.667
- No one, sergeant major.
- No one?

19:21.750 --> 19:23.333
Are you telling me
this just happened

19:23.417 --> 19:25.375
for no cause at all?

19:25.458 --> 19:27.292
Yes, sergeant major.

19:27.375 --> 19:29.250
Well, in that case..

19:29.333 --> 19:32.917
...you four mutants can
just follow me to the brig.

19:33.000 --> 19:36.458
Sarge, sarge.
Hold on a minute, will you?

19:37.875 --> 19:39.917
[whispering]

19:43.667 --> 19:46.917
The chief has asked me to
overlook this little ruckus.

19:48.417 --> 19:51.708
And as this is his jurisdiction,
I've agreed.

19:51.792 --> 19:56.667
But let me catch one of you
stepping out of line again

19:56.750 --> 19:58.708
and you'll curse
your own mothers

19:58.792 --> 20:00.167
'for ever bringing
your stroking butts'

20:00.250 --> 20:02.667
into the light of day.
Is that clear?

20:02.750 --> 20:04.958
- Yes, sergeant major.
- Yes, sergeant major.

20:06.500 --> 20:08.625
Now, you get the
hell out of here.

20:08.708 --> 20:11.125
And clean yourselves up.

20:11.208 --> 20:13.125
Move it.

20:13.208 --> 20:15.292
Move on out of here!
Clear it.

20:18.833 --> 20:20.667
(Dodger)
'Hey!'

20:20.750 --> 20:22.458
Hey, chief!

20:22.542 --> 20:24.167
Name's Garibaldi, Michael.

20:24.250 --> 20:25.708
Oh, they call me Dodger.

20:25.792 --> 20:27.792
I just wanted to thank you
for what you did back there

20:27.875 --> 20:29.667
even though
I can't quite figure why.

20:29.750 --> 20:31.792
Ambassador Delenn
told me what happened.

20:31.875 --> 20:33.417
Who's Ambassador Delenn?

20:33.500 --> 20:34.750
The woman you helped.

20:34.833 --> 20:37.125
She's an ambassador?

20:37.208 --> 20:39.500
Oh, leave it to Kleist
to mess up big time.

20:39.583 --> 20:41.125
Oh, you almost
messed up yourself.

20:41.208 --> 20:42.750
Well, it wouldn't be
the first time.

20:42.833 --> 20:45.292
[beeps]
Garibaldi.

20:45.375 --> 20:47.125
(male #2 on speaker)
'Chief, we got a 288
in brown six.'

20:47.208 --> 20:48.875
'Another ground-pounder.'

20:48.958 --> 20:51.042
What a surprise.
I'll handle it.

20:51.125 --> 20:53.958
I gotta go,
you stay out of trouble, okay?

20:56.417 --> 20:58.375
Uh.. Hey..

20:58.458 --> 20:59.875
'I'll see you around.'

20:59.958 --> 21:01.875
Michael Garibaldi.

21:05.625 --> 21:07.833
Nice butt.

21:07.917 --> 21:10.958
[dramatic music]

21:12.542 --> 21:13.875
(Sheridan)
They've got the
western approach

21:13.958 --> 21:16.000
covered by flanking fire.

21:16.083 --> 21:17.542
And you're exposed.

21:17.625 --> 21:19.792
What if we came in
from the south here?

21:19.875 --> 21:22.500
That whole area's mined,
you'll need sappers.

21:22.583 --> 21:23.833
With luck, you could
break through before

21:23.917 --> 21:26.000
they bring their
big guns to bear.

21:26.083 --> 21:28.208
Even so, you're going
to take heavy casualties.

21:28.292 --> 21:29.542
The Shilassens assured us

21:29.625 --> 21:31.333
this could be done
with minimal losses.

21:31.417 --> 21:33.792
General, they lied.

21:33.875 --> 21:35.500
If Matok could be
taken so easily

21:35.583 --> 21:37.500
they'd have done it themselves.

21:37.583 --> 21:39.042
Now, if you really
want my advice

21:39.125 --> 21:41.375
call this whole thing off
while there's still time.

21:41.458 --> 21:43.333
They will listen to you.

21:43.417 --> 21:45.375
It's a trade-off, captain.

21:45.458 --> 21:48.375
We keep the Shilassens in power
and they give us the right to

21:48.458 --> 21:51.875
establish a permanent presence
in their sector.

21:51.958 --> 21:54.000
A sector which is
strategically close

21:54.083 --> 21:57.000
to the Narn and the Centauri.

21:57.083 --> 21:59.917
Their war is going to tear
this galaxy apart.

22:00.000 --> 22:03.500
And it's just a matter of time
before Earth must choose sides.

22:03.583 --> 22:07.375
So for better or worse,
my orders are to take Matok.

22:07.458 --> 22:09.583

- Send him in.

What do you want?

22:33.125 --> 22:34.542
I didn't mean it.

I've got work to do.

You are dismissed, doctor!

22:45.208 --> 22:46.875
Yes, sir!

22:53.500 --> 22:56.083
- General, maybe you should--
- Tell me something.

22:56.167 --> 22:59.125
Captain, when you destroyed
the black star

22:59.208 --> 23:01.250

23:02.083 --> 23:04.083
...a murderer?

23:04.167 --> 23:06.750
[dramatic music]

23:06.833 --> 23:09.000
That's not an easy
question to answer.

23:10.708 --> 23:13.542
I suppose the Minbari
consider me one.

23:13.625 --> 23:17.125
But the Minbari are not
your own flesh and blood.

23:20.542 --> 23:23.417
There's only one truth
about war.

23:23.500 --> 23:25.125
People die.

23:25.208 --> 23:27.458
Killing is part
of a soldier's job.

23:27.542 --> 23:28.958
We can't deny it.

23:29.042 --> 23:30.292
We can only live with it

23:30.375 --> 23:32.750
and hope the reasons
for doing it are justified.

23:34.083 --> 23:37.625
If only my son
could realize that.

23:37.708 --> 23:40.000
General, your son
is one of the finest doctors

23:40.083 --> 23:42.750

23:42.833 --> 23:44.833

every rule there is

23:44.917 --> 23:48.833
if there's a life to be saved
or pain to be soothed.

23:48.917 --> 23:51.583
And he's a holy terror when his
principles are challenged.

23:51.667 --> 23:55.167
Good, a man who won't stand up
for his own principles

23:55.250 --> 23:57.542
is not really a man at all.

23:59.333 --> 24:02.333
Yeah, my father used to say
the same thing to me.

24:02.417 --> 24:04.208
'Of course
there were times when'

24:04.292 --> 24:06.667

Oh, we got mad,
we, we argued, we fought.

24:11.875 --> 24:14.875
And finally one day,
we both realized that..

24:16.125 --> 24:17.417
...neither of us
could be anything

24:17.500 --> 24:19.417
other than what we were.

24:20.875 --> 24:23.458
But we never stopped talking..

24:23.542 --> 24:25.458
...or loving each other.

24:28.292 --> 24:30.000
It's been a long day, captain.

24:30.083 --> 24:32.250

again tomorrow.

33:21.958 --> 33:24.042
Who's this Buffer
he keeps talking about?

33:24.125 --> 33:26.208
Ah, it's his best friend.

33:26.292 --> 33:29.000
They served together
over 25 years.

33:29.083 --> 33:31.083
Buffer bought it in
the Mars rebellion.

33:33.667 --> 33:36.208
What about you?
Seen any action?

33:36.292 --> 33:37.667
No, not yet.

33:37.750 --> 33:39.750
I've only been in
a couple months.

33:39.833 --> 33:41.292
But I'm ready.

33:42.292 --> 33:44.250
I guess.

33:44.333 --> 33:45.625
You?

33:45.708 --> 33:47.125
Sure.

33:48.542 --> 33:51.250
You...you know, scared?

33:52.042 --> 33:53.417
You're always scared.

33:53.500 --> 33:54.958
That's part of the job.

33:55.042 --> 33:56.625
But you're gonna do okay.

33:56.708 --> 33:59.333
That's right, the man's right.

33:59.417 --> 34:00.958
Like old Buffer used to say..

34:01.042 --> 34:02.750
"Any Gropo who ain't scared

34:02.833 --> 34:05.417
is either dead or stupid."

34:05.500 --> 34:07.417
Don't worry about it, kid.

34:07.500 --> 34:09.125
It's what keeps you going

34:09.208 --> 34:10.875
when you're in it, huh.

34:12.167 --> 34:13.500
Hey!

34:15.083 --> 34:17.208
Here's to you, Buffer.

34:17.292 --> 34:18.458
Wait.

34:19.375 --> 34:21.083
Here's to all of us.

34:23.042 --> 34:26.125
[indistinct chatter]

34:28.292 --> 34:29.542
Dodger?

34:30.375 --> 34:31.708
Hey, Garibaldi.

34:33.208 --> 34:34.458
I..

34:34.542 --> 34:37.000
Um, about last night,
I, uh..

34:38.417 --> 34:41.125
I-I'm sorry, I..

34:41.208 --> 34:43.000
I was out of line.

34:43.083 --> 34:46.000
It's just, sometimes..

34:46.083 --> 34:47.000
[sighs]

34:47.083 --> 34:49.500
I just want things too bad.

34:49.583 --> 34:51.042
'I guess, you know?'

34:52.625 --> 34:54.417
Especially when..

34:54.500 --> 34:57.000
When what?

34:57.083 --> 35:00.833
I just have a bad feeling
about this tour, you know.

35:00.917 --> 35:04.000
I mean, they say
we're going to Io but..

35:04.083 --> 35:06.333
...I don't believe it.

35:06.417 --> 35:10.167
Good ol' firestorm would never
lead a coffee and cake run.

35:13.583 --> 35:14.917
What, you know something?

35:15.000 --> 35:17.333
Me? No.

35:17.417 --> 35:21.833
Garibaldi, for a security slug,
you're a lousy liar.

35:21.917 --> 35:25.208
- Yeah, I just--
- No, no, it's alright.

35:25.292 --> 35:27.083
I don't want to know.

35:28.208 --> 35:30.375
How about I buy you a drink?

35:30.458 --> 35:32.667
I'll let you buy me a water.

35:32.750 --> 35:35.792
You really know
how to live it up, Garibaldi.

35:35.875 --> 35:37.583
So, these Minbari fighters
are coming right at us

35:37.667 --> 35:38.792
fifteen clicks a second.

35:38.875 --> 35:41.000
The captain's telling us
to hold our fire.

35:41.083 --> 35:44.500
Now, I'm telling you,
I'm sweating, all of a sudden--

35:44.583 --> 35:46.083
What the hell
are you doing, airboy?

35:46.167 --> 35:47.958
Oh, hey, I'm sorry.
Let me buy you another one.

35:48.042 --> 35:49.875
I don't take drinks
from airboys.

35:49.958 --> 35:52.167
Hey, you look like you got
an attitude problem.

35:53.250 --> 35:55.375
Want to do something about it?

35:55.458 --> 35:58.292
Back off.
I can handle this.

35:59.292 --> 36:00.583
Now, look..

36:00.667 --> 36:02.125
...I said I was sorry.

36:02.208 --> 36:04.750
If that's not good enough
we can take this outside.

36:06.125 --> 36:07.500
[sighs]

36:07.583 --> 36:09.250
Why wait to go out?

36:09.333 --> 36:10.917
[grunting]

36:11.000 --> 36:12.583
There it is.

36:13.292 --> 36:14.292
[grunts]

36:14.375 --> 36:15.667
Battle call.

36:15.750 --> 36:17.750
[dramatic music]

36:17.833 --> 36:20.250
Garibaldi to security.
Major 415, casino.

36:21.417 --> 36:22.417
Hyah!

36:22.500 --> 36:23.708
[grunts]

36:25.083 --> 36:27.208
I'm getting too old
for this crap.

36:32.042 --> 36:35.083
[grunting]

36:38.167 --> 36:39.833
[shouting]

36:47.417 --> 36:48.750
[chair clatters]

36:49.333 --> 36:51.042
Uh-oh.

36:51.125 --> 36:53.000
[grunting]

36:59.958 --> 37:01.792
Ten-hut!

37:05.708 --> 37:07.792
(male #1)
'Ten-hut.'

37:07.875 --> 37:10.458
(Richard)
Alright, you ground-pounders!

37:10.542 --> 37:11.875
If it's fighting you want

37:11.958 --> 37:13.917
then you're about
to get your share.

37:14.000 --> 37:16.208
Sergeant major,
move these people out!

37:16.292 --> 37:17.708
You heard the general.

37:17.792 --> 37:19.958
The balloon's going up.

37:20.042 --> 37:21.708
Get back to your quarters,
grab your gear

37:21.792 --> 37:24.625
and be at launch point at 2200.

37:24.708 --> 37:26.125
'Move it.'

37:26.208 --> 37:29.375
Hey...you alright?

37:29.458 --> 37:32.375
It's the best thing
next to sex.

37:32.458 --> 37:34.042
You're alright.

37:34.125 --> 37:35.875
I'll see you.

37:35.958 --> 37:38.750
Looks like you're gonna see
your first firefight, kid.

37:38.833 --> 37:41.042
I know this sounds nuts
but I'm actually

37:41.125 --> 37:42.875
gonna miss you guys.

37:42.958 --> 37:44.958
Take care of yourselves, okay!

37:45.042 --> 37:47.125
Will do, airboy, will do.

37:51.458 --> 37:53.792
(Plug)
'Move it!'

37:53.875 --> 37:56.958
I'm sorry about this
unfortunate display, captain.

37:57.042 --> 37:58.667
If you prepare
a list of the charges

37:58.750 --> 38:00.292
I'll see that those responsible

38:00.375 --> 38:02.500
are punished
and reparations made.

38:02.583 --> 38:06.000
I'll take the reparation
but as far as punishment..

38:06.083 --> 38:08.458
Frankly, I'd rather have
this bunch with you

38:08.542 --> 38:09.833
than in the brig.

38:09.917 --> 38:12.708
Besides, I don't think
we have the room.

38:15.667 --> 38:18.708
[dramatic music]

38:24.625 --> 38:25.750
Good luck, sir.

38:25.833 --> 38:28.250
I hope I was wrong about Matok.

38:28.333 --> 38:32.417
Well, these are good men
and women, brave people.

38:32.500 --> 38:35.542
So one way or the other,
we'll get the job done.

38:35.625 --> 38:38.875
Captain, thanks
for all of your help.

38:38.958 --> 38:41.042
- Commander.
- General.

38:42.792 --> 38:44.875
Frank, give us a moment.

38:48.625 --> 38:50.500
Take care of yourself, dad.

38:50.583 --> 38:52.375
You, too, Stephen.

38:52.458 --> 38:55.583
And for whatever
disagreements we may have

38:55.667 --> 38:57.875
you're your own man.

38:57.958 --> 39:00.792
And for that I'm very proud.

39:00.875 --> 39:04.292
And when I get back,
I promise we'll talk.

39:04.375 --> 39:06.583
But in the meantime, please

39:06.667 --> 39:10.417
call your mother and sisters
occasionally, hmm.

39:10.500 --> 39:11.917
Yes, sir.

39:26.833 --> 39:28.917
Anybody seen Dodger?
Have you seen Dodger?

39:29.000 --> 39:31.208
Have you seen Dodger?
Have you seen her?

39:31.292 --> 39:33.083
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

39:34.167 --> 39:35.917
You stay low
and keep your ears open.

39:36.000 --> 39:37.750
I expect you back.

39:37.833 --> 39:39.625
And then, uh..

39:39.708 --> 39:41.417
Well, we'll see what happens.

39:42.417 --> 39:44.083
- It's a date.
- Okay.

39:44.167 --> 39:46.000
Private Durman.

39:46.083 --> 39:47.625
Would you care to join us?

39:47.708 --> 39:49.125
Yes, sir.

39:51.750 --> 39:54.833
[instrumental music]

40:01.458 --> 40:04.125
Private Durman!

40:05.542 --> 40:07.375
Never know what you missed.

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
Move it.

40:14.875 --> 40:16.292
[laughing]

40:18.292 --> 40:21.375
[dramatic music]

40:30.792 --> 40:32.125
(woman on TV)
'Since last night's
surprise announcement'

40:32.208 --> 40:33.583
'that the senate's
was officially'

40:33.667 --> 40:35.708
'giving military aide
to the planet Akdor.'

40:35.792 --> 40:38.000
'We have learned that the
first phase of this mission'

40:38.083 --> 40:40.792
'dubbed Operation Sudden Death,
is complete.'

40:40.875 --> 40:44.417
We go now to a report
taped earlier on Akdor.

40:44.500 --> 40:46.125
This is Tonya Wallace
reporting from Akdor.

40:46.208 --> 40:48.000
Where the 356th
infantry division

40:48.083 --> 40:50.375
is assaulting
the rebel stronghold at Matok.

40:50.458 --> 40:52.792
The fighting is reported
to be very intense.

40:53.458 --> 40:56.500
[intense music]

[crashes]

41:24.042 --> 41:25.708
That was the scene
four hours ago.

41:25.792 --> 41:27.708
We now go live to Akdor.

41:27.792 --> 41:29.375
I'm here with
General Richard Franklin

41:29.458 --> 41:31.792
'Commander of the 356th.'

41:31.875 --> 41:34.000
General, can you tell us
the results of the battle?

41:34.083 --> 41:35.542
Our troops have
gained control

41:35.625 --> 41:37.458
over the fortress at Matok.

41:37.542 --> 41:39.125
Most of the leaders
of the rebellion

41:39.208 --> 41:40.958
have either been
killed or captured

41:41.042 --> 41:42.708
and we expect
the complete surrender

41:42.792 --> 41:45.583
of all the rebel forces
very shortly.

41:45.667 --> 41:47.833

(Tonya on TV)
'Then you consider
this a victory?'

41:49.750 --> 41:52.333
- Yes, but at a very high--
- General!

41:54.208 --> 41:56.792
I'm needed elsewhere.

41:56.875 --> 41:59.417
We will be continuing live
coverage throughout the day.

41:59.500 --> 42:02.917
'For now, this is Tonya Wallace,
ISN, signing off.'

42:03.000 --> 42:04.625
- Chief.
- Yeah.

42:04.708 --> 42:06.917
The first casualty reports
are in from Akdor.

42:07.000 --> 42:08.375
You said you wanted to see them.

42:08.458 --> 42:09.667
Yeah.
