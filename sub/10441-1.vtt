01:03.005 --> 01:07.705
A couple of words of advice for all
you hopefuls out there in unsigned bands.

01:08.611 --> 01:10.341
Fuck off.

01:11.080 --> 01:12.614
Seriously, your parents are right.

01:12.615 --> 01:15.984
You may as well spend
your guitar-string money on lottery tickets.

01:15.985 --> 01:17.476
Your chances will be much the same.

01:23.993 --> 01:26.963
You see, there's one thing you have
to understand about the music industry.

01:27.630 --> 01:29.631
We have no obligation to make art.

01:29.632 --> 01:32.367
We have no obligation
to make political statements.

01:32.368 --> 01:35.202
We have no obligation to make good records.

01:36.138 --> 01:38.471
We have an obligation to make money.

01:39.375 --> 01:43.938
I mean, do these look like the shoes of someone
who gives a fuck Velvet Underground?

01:45.748 --> 01:49.241
Now, in order to make money,
we may sometimes have to make art.

01:49.618 --> 01:52.110
We may sometimes have
to make political statements.

01:52.488 --> 01:55.686
Sometimes we may even have
to make good records.

01:56.125 --> 01:59.687
Our record company receives half
a million demos a year.

02:00.362 --> 02:02.558
We sign just ten of them.

02:03.099 --> 02:04.590
And who makes these choices?

02:04.967 --> 02:07.735
Who is responsible
for dividing the wheat from the chaff

02:07.736 --> 02:10.705
and providing the soundtrack
to your short life on this planet?

02:11.373 --> 02:16.812
Us, the elite, the chosen few,
the best of the best.

02:17.980 --> 02:19.471
The A&R men.

02:20.616 --> 02:25.452
Roger, why do you have a copy
of the fucking Menswear album?

02:25.721 --> 02:27.255
I looked into signing them a couple of years ago.

02:27.256 --> 02:28.451
There's some good tunes on that.

02:28.858 --> 02:30.087
It's four o'clock in the morning.

02:30.626 --> 02:33.628
My colleague Roger and
I are brainstorming producer ideas.

02:33.629 --> 02:34.824
How about Mike Hedges?

02:35.030 --> 02:38.728
No. I find some of his mixes a bit middly.

02:39.869 --> 02:41.503
- Middly?
- You know, too much...

02:41.504 --> 02:44.474
Not enough top or, you know, bottom end.

02:49.011 --> 02:52.209
What about the guy who produced
London Calling? What's his name?

02:52.848 --> 02:54.214
- Guy Stevens?
- Yeah.

02:54.750 --> 02:55.581
He'd be great.

02:56.018 --> 02:57.452
There is a problem, however.

02:58.020 --> 03:00.717
What? Is he a wanker?

03:01.624 --> 03:04.219
I don't know. He died in 1981.

03:09.632 --> 03:11.123
What's happening with the Rage album?

03:11.267 --> 03:12.098
Fuck knows.

03:12.601 --> 03:13.735
It's all gone Colonel Kurtz.

03:13.736 --> 03:15.329
The crazy bastard's up river, beyond the law.

03:16.105 --> 03:19.841
Been in a residential studio for six months
now at a thousand quid a day

03:19.842 --> 03:21.376
and David hasn't heard a fucking note yet.

03:21.377 --> 03:23.745
- David worried?
- He wants to be.

03:23.746 --> 03:26.481
What's he done this past year?
Signed a proper load of fucking turkeys.

03:26.482 --> 03:29.250
This new Rage album wants
to make ABBA's Greatest Hits

03:29.251 --> 03:31.083
sound like Sonic fucking Youth
or he's finished.

03:31.987 --> 03:32.955
Fucking nasty.

03:33.122 --> 03:34.818
If he goes, they might offer you his job.

03:35.391 --> 03:36.586
What, Head of A&R?

03:41.263 --> 03:42.356
They might offer it to you.

03:43.032 --> 03:45.592
No. No, you've got...

03:48.871 --> 03:50.066
...you know, seniority.

03:51.840 --> 03:53.433
Right, I'll get the drinks in.

03:55.010 --> 03:57.111
Last year, 1996,

03:57.112 --> 04:01.616
the turnover of the British music industry
passed the billion-pound mark for the first time.

04:01.617 --> 04:02.750
Aceed!

04:02.751 --> 04:03.851
Boom times.

04:03.852 --> 04:05.946
But there's always competition.

04:06.622 --> 04:08.856
Imagine you're standing on wafer-thin ice.

04:08.857 --> 04:11.859
Beneath your feet you can see sharks circling,

04:11.860 --> 04:14.955
terrible sharks
with hypodermic syringes for teeth.

04:15.030 --> 04:17.464
These are your colleagues, your friends.

04:17.733 --> 04:20.500
Roger and I both have to live
with an uncomfortable statistic:

04:20.502 --> 04:23.871
at some point in the coming year,
one of us will probably be fired.

04:23.872 --> 04:26.364
I have no intention of it being me.

04:34.750 --> 04:35.843
I'm a bear!

04:36.151 --> 04:37.847
I'm a dancing bear!

04:38.120 --> 04:41.557
Hey, bear, bear. Bear, eat CDs!

04:43.859 --> 04:46.090
What you got, bear?
What you got? Seal?

04:46.862 --> 04:48.455
Bear eat Seal. Yeah.

04:56.272 --> 04:58.241
Bear. Bear.

04:59.008 --> 05:02.968
Bear tired. Bear tired. Oh, bear.

05:05.481 --> 05:06.748
So here's what I do.

05:06.749 --> 05:09.984
I listen to music, bands, singers, songwriters,

05:09.985 --> 05:13.254
and decide which ones have
a good chance of commercial success.

05:13.255 --> 05:16.124
I then arrange for them
to be recorded in a sympathetic manner

05:16.125 --> 05:20.128
and then we, the record company,
sell them to you, the general public.

05:20.129 --> 05:23.631
That's A&R, artiste and repertoire.

05:23.632 --> 05:24.366
Simple, eh?

05:24.367 --> 05:25.459
Get fucked.

05:26.869 --> 05:28.462
You wouldn't last ten minutes.

07:25.020 --> 07:28.022
'In every age, men are born who,
in their hearts,

07:28.023 --> 07:30.725
in the black of their blood, are warriors,

07:30.726 --> 07:33.457
but for most of us,
there are no longer wars to fight.'

07:34.029 --> 07:35.363
Morning.

07:35.364 --> 07:37.560
'What must they do, these men?'

07:41.603 --> 07:43.271
- Steven Stelfox's office.
- Steven there?

07:43.272 --> 07:45.840
- No, I'm afraid he's not.
- OK, I'll call back later.

07:45.841 --> 07:47.571
OK. Bye.

07:48.744 --> 07:50.745
Did you listen to that EP I gave you?

07:50.746 --> 07:52.246
Swedish band, The Lazies?

07:52.247 --> 07:54.482
- I think they're really...
- Christ, I hate bands.

07:54.483 --> 07:58.818
- Unfortunate career choice.
- Anyhow, it's on my pile.

08:01.023 --> 08:01.956
Rebecca...

08:04.259 --> 08:06.819
- You look nice today.
- Thank you, Steven.

08:07.629 --> 08:08.722
- Darren's here.
- Hey, boss.

08:10.499 --> 08:11.330
Check this out.

08:32.254 --> 08:33.085
Jeez.

08:35.390 --> 08:36.024
That's limited edition.

08:36.025 --> 08:38.583
Well, I hope they limited it
to their immediate fucking family.

08:39.126 --> 08:40.962
Christ.

08:40.962 --> 08:41.931
Look at this.

08:42.865 --> 08:47.064
18-year-old sensation Ellie Crush
nominated for three Brits.

08:47.603 --> 08:50.004
Crush's A&R Manager, Tony Parker Hall,

08:50.005 --> 08:52.507
says, 'We've spent two years developing Ellie.'

08:52.508 --> 08:57.011
'The nominations reflect her talent and
all the hard work everyone at the label has put in.'

08:57.012 --> 08:58.036
Christ.

08:58.480 --> 09:00.073
The bastard's magnanimous no less.

09:00.482 --> 09:01.814
There's a lot of interest in that band.

09:01.984 --> 09:03.077
Do me a favour.

09:03.252 --> 09:05.386
Fucking Oasis rock up,

09:05.387 --> 09:07.722
a couple of manc car thieves
with a Beatles songbook,

09:07.723 --> 09:09.817
and now we all have to go finding an indie band?

09:10.259 --> 09:13.058
Look, you haven't been here long,
Darren, so remember this.

09:13.962 --> 09:15.453
Real people don't care about indie bands.

09:15.964 --> 09:19.867
Real people put stone cladding and new
PVC double glazing on their council houses.

09:19.868 --> 09:23.004
They buy four albums a year and
they want to hear all the fucking words,

09:23.005 --> 09:25.099
and there are billions of the cunts.

09:25.741 --> 09:27.608
So, come on, you're the scout.
Scout some proper hits.

09:27.609 --> 09:28.440
Yeah.

09:30.145 --> 09:33.081
- They're rough, but they could develop.
- Yeah, like a fucking tumour.

09:34.383 --> 09:35.942
Darren, what is the meaning of life?

09:38.020 --> 09:39.113
Sign good bands.

09:39.388 --> 09:41.084
Make records you're proud of.

09:42.491 --> 09:43.322
Fuck me.

09:45.494 --> 09:46.462
Morning.

09:49.031 --> 09:50.829
Fucking great night, eh?

09:51.733 --> 09:54.066
State of me when I woke up. Jesus.

09:55.737 --> 09:56.966
I'll see you in business affairs.

09:57.272 --> 09:58.365
Oi, come on.

10:05.013 --> 10:06.106
Meetings.

10:06.381 --> 10:08.714
Nothing important ever
got decided in a meeting.

10:09.384 --> 10:11.085
What they are very good for, however,

10:11.086 --> 10:13.920
is stitching up,
humiliating and belittling people.

10:16.625 --> 10:18.116
Fat boy here you already know.

10:18.961 --> 10:21.362
We also have Derek Sommers
Managing Director.

10:21.363 --> 10:25.266
Given that our MD's idea of fun is
paying a couple of Bethnal Green rent boys

10:25.267 --> 10:26.867
to kick the shit out of him,

10:26.868 --> 10:31.839
it's no surprise that sadism and aggression
are values our company encourages and rewards.

10:31.840 --> 10:36.744
James Trellick, Head of Legal and
Business Affairs Ruthless, amoral, top bloke.

10:36.745 --> 10:39.080
David Schneider, Head of A&R.

10:39.081 --> 10:40.848
Technically my boss, for now.

10:40.849 --> 10:42.249
Ross, Head of Marketing.

10:42.250 --> 10:46.020
Would double-end his own mother
with Satan to put a record in the top 10.

10:46.021 --> 10:51.025
Rob Hastings, Indie type,
the guy who put the um and ah in A&R.

10:51.026 --> 10:53.260
Nikki, Head of International.

10:53.261 --> 10:57.632
I have no sexual interest in Nikki,
so, in a way, she doesn't exist.

10:57.633 --> 11:00.125
And taking minutes, Katy, Trellick's PA.

11:01.269 --> 11:02.870
Doable.

11:02.871 --> 11:06.069
Hey, how come
I didn't get my Music Week yet?

11:06.375 --> 11:08.142
Because you don't work in the music industry.

11:08.143 --> 11:11.379
Okey-dokey, boys and girls
Eyes down for a full house.

11:11.380 --> 11:13.848
You all have a copy of
the agenda in front of you.

11:13.849 --> 11:16.080
David, where are we with the Rage album?

11:16.852 --> 11:20.121
Well, yeah, he's mixing,
so we're not far away now.

11:20.122 --> 11:21.122
Tour's booked.

11:21.123 --> 11:24.258
Steven and I are gonna meet up with him
in Cannes next week to go over the budget.

11:24.259 --> 11:26.694
Got a lot of territories asking for a release date.

11:27.262 --> 11:29.231
How's the record sounding, David?

11:29.965 --> 11:33.333
Well, you know what he's like, Derek,
you know, plays his cards close to his chest.

11:33.969 --> 11:36.700
- Do we have a single?
- Not yet, no.

11:37.005 --> 11:40.339
You know, as you know, it's... sometimes
you can't rush the creative process, you know.

11:41.009 --> 11:42.743
David, as head of this label,

11:42.744 --> 11:46.013
I don't think I'm being unreasonable
in asking to hear some music

11:46.014 --> 11:48.983
from an act in which we have
a considerable financial investment.

11:48.984 --> 11:53.020
We're currently?
486,000 in the hole on this record.

11:53.021 --> 11:56.023
It's two years since the debut album
and quite frankly...

11:56.024 --> 11:58.025
Well, hang on, Derek.
It's not like nothing's been happening.

11:58.026 --> 12:00.494
We're doing some stuff to maintain awareness.

12:00.495 --> 12:02.691
Those new T-shirts David
had made look fantastic.

12:04.266 --> 12:05.234
T-shirts?

12:07.002 --> 12:08.561
What fucking T-shirts?

12:09.004 --> 12:11.372
Oh, yeah, I mean, well, you know...

12:11.373 --> 12:13.974
You're making T-shirts for an artist
who doesn't have an album out

12:13.975 --> 12:15.609
and is half a million quid unrecouped?

12:15.610 --> 12:18.479
- Are you out of your fucking mind?
- Yeah, but, Derek, I just thought...

12:18.480 --> 12:20.381
I don't give a fuck what you thought!

12:20.382 --> 12:22.383
We're in the shit. We need some hits.

12:22.384 --> 12:25.086
If we don't have a single soon,
I'm pulling the fucking plug.

12:25.087 --> 12:26.620
- Do you understand?
- Yeah, but I...

12:26.621 --> 12:30.024
Do you fucking understand?

12:30.025 --> 12:33.127
- Yeah. Yes, Derek, yeah.
- OK.

12:33.128 --> 12:34.323
Moving on.

12:34.963 --> 12:35.555
Rob.

12:36.631 --> 12:37.462
Sound Collective.

12:42.003 --> 12:43.027
For God's sake.

12:46.975 --> 12:47.943
Well played.

12:48.844 --> 12:50.845
Derek seems even
more tightly wrapped than usual.

12:50.846 --> 12:53.481
We need some hits.
The release schedule's a wasteland.

12:53.482 --> 12:54.916
Well, if Schneider got fired...

12:56.251 --> 12:57.219
I'm just saying.

12:58.253 --> 13:02.953
Then either Derek goes out of house
for a new head of A&R or it's you.

13:03.024 --> 13:04.458
Or it's laughing boy there.

13:05.260 --> 13:08.729
- Waters?
- Pros: he's a couple of years older than you.

13:08.730 --> 13:10.865
More experience making albums.

13:10.866 --> 13:13.961
The rank and file think he's a nice bloke.

13:14.736 --> 13:19.740
Cons: he's a lazy, brain-dead cocaine
addict with the attention span of a fucking gnat

13:19.741 --> 13:21.976
who hasn't had a hit record in donkey's.

13:21.977 --> 13:23.978
- So he could get the job.
- Correctos.

13:23.979 --> 13:26.471
Signing a nice big hit record
wouldn't hurt your cause.

13:26.982 --> 13:28.575
Thanks for that blinding insight, James.

13:30.018 --> 13:32.578
What is the meaning of life, young Stelfox?

13:32.988 --> 13:36.948
To drive your enemies before you
and hear the lamentations of their women.

13:38.860 --> 13:39.828
Good boy.

13:40.128 --> 13:41.096
See you in Cannes.

13:42.030 --> 13:44.265
I tried to imagine Roger as my boss,

13:44.266 --> 13:46.000
Roger who tried to sign Menswear,

13:46.001 --> 13:48.269
who thought Guy Stevens was living and well,

13:48.270 --> 13:52.708
whose idea of a perfectly normal night out
involves waking up covered in someone else's piss,

13:53.375 --> 13:55.376
but a crimson mist keeps closing in,

13:55.377 --> 13:57.812
a skull charge of blood
keeps dimming my vision.

14:02.150 --> 14:03.018
Midem.

14:03.019 --> 14:04.618
Back in the 1960s,

14:04.619 --> 14:08.489
a couple of Frog bum boys decided
to have a little music industry convention

14:08.490 --> 14:09.857
in the South of France.

14:09.858 --> 14:11.959
30 years later every January

14:11.960 --> 14:18.098
10,000 A&R guys descend upon Cannesfor
a free-loading orgy of utter fucking nonsense.

14:18.099 --> 14:19.226
- Oi, oi!
- Danny.

14:20.135 --> 14:21.969
Danny Rent, two-bob manager.

14:21.970 --> 14:23.871
- Bollocks!
- Andy Restbourne, Sony.

14:23.872 --> 14:25.067
Having it large, mate.

14:26.141 --> 14:28.235
Some cunt I did bugle with once.

14:28.743 --> 14:30.075
Over here, son. Over here.

14:30.378 --> 14:31.471
Incoming!

14:32.247 --> 14:34.081
Anthony Parker Hall.

14:34.082 --> 14:36.150
Three Brit nominations for that slag?

14:36.151 --> 14:37.483
You having a fucking laugh?

14:38.987 --> 14:39.716
Who's this?

14:41.623 --> 14:43.114
This is Darren, new scout.

14:43.625 --> 14:44.456
Good luck, mate.

14:45.126 --> 14:46.627
What you got going on over here, then?

14:46.628 --> 14:48.824
Meeting with the Germans tonight
at the Martinez.

14:49.965 --> 14:51.797
- Probably see you out, yeah?
- Yeah, later.

14:53.001 --> 14:54.025
Clown.

14:59.241 --> 15:03.337
I was looking for some action

15:29.371 --> 15:30.566
Hey, Rudi.

15:33.241 --> 15:34.800
Steven!

15:36.144 --> 15:37.745
How's it going, man?

15:37.746 --> 15:40.848
- When'd you get in?
- Just this morning, man.

15:40.849 --> 15:43.683
I had Gunther fly ahead
to take care of stuff, you know.

15:44.753 --> 15:47.621
You know me, time is money, bro.
Hardcore!

15:47.622 --> 15:49.591
- Yeah.
- Hardcore!

15:50.025 --> 15:52.585
- Hey, Steven. How are you?
- I'm very good.

15:53.094 --> 15:54.495
This is Darren, new scout.

15:54.496 --> 15:56.263
- What's up, Darren? How you doing?
- Yeah, good.

15:56.264 --> 15:57.823
Listen, do you want me to make you happy?

15:58.266 --> 15:59.366
- Should I make you happy?
- Very.

15:59.367 --> 16:02.136
- I'm gonna make you happy right now.
- Thank you, Rudi. Crack on.

16:02.137 --> 16:04.972
Listen to this shit, man.
Listen to that shit, man.

16:04.973 --> 16:05.607
Come on, hit it.

16:05.608 --> 16:08.042
Hold on, hold on. Bitches, come here.

16:08.610 --> 16:10.203
Listen. Come here.

16:11.112 --> 16:11.980
- Want some?
- Yeah, I'll have a glass.

16:11.981 --> 16:13.073
Shut the fuck up!

16:13.748 --> 16:15.114
One, two, three, four. Hit it.

17:21.750 --> 17:22.944
Yeah, baby!

17:24.986 --> 17:26.579
Who told you? Who told you?

17:27.088 --> 17:29.723
- Who told you, Steven?
- Yeah.

17:29.724 --> 17:32.493
I told you, man. I told you!

17:32.494 --> 17:35.963
Yes, yes, Rudi. It's...

17:35.964 --> 17:38.999
Biggest fucking hit we've had
so far in Germany, man. Biggest hit.

17:39.000 --> 17:40.000
- Really?
- Yeah.

17:40.001 --> 17:42.870
- Who's the singer?
- Fuck the singer.

17:42.871 --> 17:44.138
What are you talking about, the singer?

17:44.139 --> 17:46.108
Who cares about the fucking singer?

17:47.142 --> 17:49.475
It's just a girl. She was in the studio.

17:49.978 --> 17:51.745
She's like... What do you call a...

17:51.746 --> 17:53.476
it's a... A moose.

17:53.982 --> 17:56.110
- Moose.
- Fucking moose!

17:57.385 --> 17:59.354
But don't worry.
We'll find someone to front it.

18:00.989 --> 18:02.218
It's catchy, Rudi, it's just...

18:02.724 --> 18:05.558
- It's the lyrics, right?
- Yeah, exactly, Rudi.

18:05.860 --> 18:09.863
Why are you so British, so square, man?
What's wrong?

18:09.864 --> 18:12.966
We did a radio edit of the whole thing...

18:12.967 --> 18:15.459
...and we changed it and the chorus now is like..

18:16.137 --> 18:17.469
What does she say? She says like...

18:19.074 --> 18:20.940
<i>Why don't you slap me on the ass?</i>

18:22.343 --> 18:24.209
<i>Why don't you slap me on the ass?</i>

18:24.846 --> 18:27.014
- And it works, man.
- That's much better.

18:27.015 --> 18:29.712
Listen, what do you think
I'm offering it to you.

18:30.852 --> 18:32.684
- First hand for the UK.
- Yeah.

18:32.987 --> 18:36.623
And all I need is 30,000 in advance

18:36.624 --> 18:37.991
- and...
- 15.

18:37.992 --> 18:39.085
15 points.

18:46.868 --> 18:47.735
So what do you reckon?

18:47.736 --> 18:48.869
What do I reckon?

18:48.870 --> 18:51.371
I reckon that tune is the biggest
insult to humanity

18:51.372 --> 18:54.842
since a room full of Nazis chuckled
over the blueprints for Auschwitz.

18:54.843 --> 18:56.143
It's utter garbage.

18:56.144 --> 19:00.981
But this is exactly what 99% of
the great British public enjoy,

19:00.982 --> 19:01.982
the fucking animals.

19:01.983 --> 19:05.119
Well, that crazed paedo has as good a track
record as anyone for this kind of crap,

19:05.120 --> 19:07.254
and stranger things have happened, mate.

19:07.255 --> 19:08.348
Is that a yes, then?

19:09.090 --> 19:11.391
What, a 30K advance,
the same again for a video,

19:11.392 --> 19:14.361
I'd have to do some remixes,
artwork, advertising.

19:14.362 --> 19:18.094
I mean, it'll cost us something like a hundred
grand to try and have a hit with that piece of shit.

19:18.867 --> 19:21.135
This is what's involved
every time you say yes, Darren.

19:21.136 --> 19:23.833
Signing records can literally cost
you your fucking job.

19:25.240 --> 19:26.208
So we say no?

19:30.245 --> 19:31.804
Maybe.

19:45.093 --> 19:45.960
Christ, look, Virgin.

19:45.961 --> 19:48.128
88.9% share of the singles market.

19:48.129 --> 19:49.688
Fucking Spice Girls.

20:06.147 --> 20:07.115
Rage.

20:09.851 --> 20:11.985
How you doing? Good to see you.

20:11.986 --> 20:13.020
- Fisher.
- How you doing? You all right?

20:13.021 --> 20:14.114
- Hi.
- Hi.

20:14.489 --> 20:15.821
So, Cannes, eh?

20:17.125 --> 20:18.093
Great stuff.

20:18.960 --> 20:20.127
- Rage, how's tricks?
- Yeah, boys.

20:20.128 --> 20:21.687
We ain't gonna do this tour.

20:23.865 --> 20:26.600
- What? But you...
- We're finishing the record.

20:26.601 --> 20:29.799
I ain't dismantling the studio
to start some fucking rehearsals.

20:30.371 --> 20:31.805
Well, let's hire the stuff for the tour.

20:32.507 --> 20:36.467
Look, do you believe in this guy long term?

20:39.080 --> 20:40.048
Yes.

20:42.016 --> 20:43.383
Of course.

20:43.384 --> 20:45.353
Then this ain't the only tour
we're gonna do, then, is it?

20:46.254 --> 20:47.347
It's an investment.

20:51.259 --> 20:52.090
How much?

20:52.727 --> 20:54.261
- 60 grand.
- Jesus.

20:54.262 --> 20:56.263
The tour support budget's high enough as it is.

20:56.264 --> 20:57.631
I don't think we can justify that sort of...

20:57.632 --> 21:00.124
Well, I guess we're pulling out of the tour, then.

21:03.271 --> 21:04.830
- 30 grand.
- 50.

21:07.008 --> 21:08.943
40, recuperable.

21:10.979 --> 21:11.571
Fair enough.

21:15.984 --> 21:19.113
This pair of sex offenders
have just raped us for 40 grand.

21:19.387 --> 21:23.724
At some point we'll see a Fantasy Island invoice
with bogus receipts stapled to it

21:23.725 --> 21:26.217
for money they never spent
on gear they do not own.

21:27.028 --> 21:28.963
So, how's the record sounding?

21:29.264 --> 21:31.233
Schneider, mate,
it's gonna blow your tits off.

21:32.133 --> 21:35.069
We'll have a playback soon.
It's fucking out there, man.

21:36.104 --> 21:38.699
Experimental as fuck.

21:44.112 --> 21:45.080
Experimental?

21:55.089 --> 21:57.058
Experimental?

21:59.627 --> 22:01.118
I think it's a smart way to go.

22:03.097 --> 22:07.134
Listen, David, we did well with the debut,
over 100,000.

22:07.135 --> 22:09.136
The obvious move will be to start chasing a hit,

22:09.137 --> 22:12.973
doing a vocal collaboration with
fucking Jarvis Cocker or whoever,

22:12.974 --> 22:16.743
but it could alienate his fan base,
all the drum and bass kids.

22:16.744 --> 22:20.147
If you make a really uncompromising
original record,

22:20.148 --> 22:24.950
you'll keep all those people,
get great press and build it organically.

22:34.128 --> 22:36.688
Fuck me. Experimental, no less?

22:37.865 --> 22:39.060
Schneider's face.

22:39.133 --> 22:41.268
And Rage was gakked off his fucking tits.

22:41.269 --> 22:44.104
I take it you counselled against
the experimental approach?

22:44.105 --> 22:45.698
- Oh, yeah, of course.
- Oi, oi!

22:47.108 --> 22:48.742
- Let's rock.
- Bloke says they're strong.

22:48.743 --> 22:50.939
Yeah, so maybe we should only do half.

22:52.380 --> 22:54.110
- Bollocks.
- Fuck off.

23:03.991 --> 23:06.960
This is the sharp end of the record industry.

23:06.961 --> 23:09.129
Our jobs involve making fast decisions

23:09.130 --> 23:12.100
with hundreds of thousands
even millions of pounds at stake.

23:12.734 --> 23:15.969
These decisions are made
under the influence of drugs,

23:15.970 --> 23:18.940
alcohol, peer pressure and fear.

23:19.741 --> 23:21.107
The fear is constant because,

23:21.609 --> 23:23.100
and you must understand this,

23:23.978 --> 23:26.345
none of us have a fucking clue
what we're doing.

23:44.499 --> 23:45.330
Darren!

23:47.001 --> 23:49.561
Yeah! Fucking massive!

23:49.971 --> 23:52.202
We verbally agreed the deal, OK?

23:53.508 --> 23:54.703
Hey! OK?

23:56.978 --> 23:57.809
Oh, fuck.

24:06.487 --> 24:08.255
Yeah, this is Rudi. Leave a message.

24:08.256 --> 24:09.623
Rudi, Rudi, it's Steven.

24:09.624 --> 24:11.992
Look, we definitely want the record.

24:11.993 --> 24:13.586
Please call me back, OK?

24:25.973 --> 24:28.842
- Hello?
- Steven! Hey, it's Rudi.

24:28.843 --> 24:30.038
Rudi, Rudi.

24:30.745 --> 24:33.840
Listen, I definitely want the record.

24:34.615 --> 24:36.082
You're a little late now, man..

24:36.083 --> 24:38.052
Already did the deal with Tony Parker Hall.

24:38.853 --> 24:43.086
You fucking Nazi... Fuck!

24:43.257 --> 24:45.351
Hello? Hello?

24:47.028 --> 24:48.361
Have you actually signed the contract yet?

24:48.362 --> 24:50.363
Well, I haven't signed the contract yet,

24:50.364 --> 24:53.133
but we sort of have
like a verbal agreement, you know?

24:53.134 --> 24:55.969
OK, Rudi. How much?

24:55.970 --> 24:58.738
I mean, come on.
You know I'm a man of my word, right?

24:58.739 --> 24:59.570
How much?

25:01.108 --> 25:02.242
- Hundred?
- Sixty.

25:02.243 --> 25:04.845
- Hundred.
- No, that's too much.

25:04.846 --> 25:05.846
60,000.

25:05.847 --> 25:07.042
All right, deal.

25:07.615 --> 25:08.446
Trellick will call you.

25:15.857 --> 25:17.587
We're now in scary territory.

25:17.859 --> 25:21.261
60 grand for a one-off single means
we'll have to have a proper hit.

25:21.262 --> 25:23.096
Number 18's no use to anyone.

25:23.097 --> 25:27.091
This piece of shit will have to be top five minimum
for me to walk away with any kind of dignity.

25:28.002 --> 25:29.503
As some of you will have heard,

25:29.504 --> 25:32.105
Steven came back from Midem last week

25:32.106 --> 25:35.099
where he signed the hottest dance
record of the convention.

25:37.845 --> 25:41.248
It's blowing up in Europe and
I'm sure we're gonna have a huge hit with it here.

25:41.249 --> 25:42.849
It's very risque, but...

25:42.850 --> 25:45.619
Yeah, I've done a new edit with alternative lyrics.

25:45.620 --> 25:48.088
Right, now, we're gonna
take the edit straight to radio,

25:48.089 --> 25:50.581
moving the original mix out to all the club DJs...

25:51.492 --> 25:53.126
Have we got some video treatments in?

25:53.127 --> 25:56.263
Yeah, well, with the budget being quite low...

25:56.264 --> 25:57.497
Derek loves the record.

25:57.498 --> 25:59.599
The marketing department love the record.

25:59.600 --> 26:01.968
The radio department love the record.

26:01.969 --> 26:04.939
I have tooled back from Cannes
bearing the cure for cancer.

26:06.374 --> 26:09.936
I see this one... as the first single.

26:10.978 --> 26:11.946
Just go with it...

26:13.848 --> 26:15.680
and let it take you on a journey.

27:13.107 --> 27:16.376
In a way,
you've almost got to respect the mad bastard.

27:16.377 --> 27:21.213
He's taken half a million quid of our money
to fund his own cocaine-induced mind orchestra.

27:22.083 --> 27:25.151
On a more positive note,
I must get the number of Rage's dealer,

27:25.152 --> 27:28.953
because the gear the cunt is getting
is clearly fucking phenomenal.

27:30.725 --> 27:31.693
It's called...

27:34.095 --> 27:35.085
Birth.

27:39.000 --> 27:41.435
Decided to pursue fresh opportunities...

27:42.003 --> 27:43.938
Apparently the cretin begged for his life.

27:44.972 --> 27:46.565
You know what they say about Schadenfreude.

27:47.241 --> 27:48.241
Is that the trip-hop mob?

27:48.242 --> 27:50.040
Signed to Deconstruction last year?

27:50.745 --> 27:53.237
- Did you see that review I left out?
- What review?

27:54.148 --> 27:56.117
Why do I bother? Here.

27:57.385 --> 27:59.820
That band I was telling you about, The Lazies.

28:00.721 --> 28:02.255
Great review of their EP in the NME.

28:02.256 --> 28:03.087
Great.

28:07.495 --> 28:08.728
- Steven?
- Hi, Milly.

28:08.729 --> 28:10.864
- Can you send him up, please?
- Yeah, I will do.

28:10.865 --> 28:12.231
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

28:12.967 --> 28:14.458
Derek wants to see you.

28:16.103 --> 28:17.971
Cometh the hour, cometh the man?

28:17.972 --> 28:19.702
In the land of the blind, Rebecca...

28:21.509 --> 28:23.843
About the Brits, can you speak
to those clowns at the cab company?

28:23.844 --> 28:26.012
Make sure they send someone
who's actually set foot in London before.

28:26.013 --> 28:28.148
Traffic will be a nightmare.
You'll be quicker on the tube.

28:28.149 --> 28:30.709
- The fucking what?
- The tube, Steven.

28:31.352 --> 28:31.986
How amusing.

28:31.987 --> 28:36.956
<i>The stage is now set for this year's Brit Awards,</i>
<i>with smash sensation Ellie Crush tipped...</i>

28:36.957 --> 28:38.789
<i>...to pick up a handful of awards.</i>

28:38.859 --> 28:42.955
Thought you might like to hear from the
plugging team how your dance hit is shaping up.

28:45.499 --> 28:47.092
Right, well, Radio 1 don't think it's for them.

28:48.502 --> 28:50.970
Maybe if it was bigger at club,
we'd have more ammunition.

28:50.971 --> 28:53.338
Derek, mate,
we've done a massive mail out, but...

28:54.108 --> 28:58.239
It just seems to be the kind of track that needs
a bit more radio before the club DJs pick up on it.

29:00.081 --> 29:00.912
Fuck.

29:06.253 --> 29:08.688
There's a good review in Mixmag.

29:10.024 --> 29:15.827
Are you telling me we've paid a hundred grand
to get a review in fucking Mixmag?

29:17.965 --> 29:22.562
So, where do we take
this cunt of a record from here?

29:26.240 --> 29:27.208
It's got me in the eye.

29:28.242 --> 29:29.743
Derek hates the record.

29:29.744 --> 29:32.145
The marketing department hate the record.

29:32.146 --> 29:34.981
The radio department hate the record.

29:34.982 --> 29:39.252
In a bizarre alchemic process perhaps
unique to the entertainment industry,

29:39.253 --> 29:41.387
the cancer cure I brought back from Cannes

29:41.388 --> 29:44.491
has mysteriously morphed into
something closer to the cause of AIDS.

29:44.492 --> 29:45.824
Girl power!

29:47.128 --> 29:50.326
- Suck my root.
- Why's that fat cunt so happy?

29:51.499 --> 29:53.331
Check out Ellie fucking Crush, man.

29:55.870 --> 29:57.003
- Ellie!
- Tony!

29:57.004 --> 29:59.139
Three Brits and, surprise, surprise,

29:59.140 --> 30:01.608
Derek's right up
Parker Hall's night fighter.

30:01.609 --> 30:04.377
Success has a thousand fathers, Steven.

30:04.378 --> 30:06.574
Failure is an orphan.

30:08.849 --> 30:09.578
Excuse me, darling.

30:10.484 --> 30:12.986
- Oi, oi, Stelfox.
- Danny.

30:12.987 --> 30:14.353
How you doing? Some birds in here!

30:15.389 --> 30:17.724
What happened with that
Suck My Dick thing you signed at Midem?

30:17.725 --> 30:20.627
We're doing some more mixes.
What you got going on?

30:20.628 --> 30:23.263
I wanna come see you, actually.
This girl band I'm managing...

30:23.264 --> 30:24.631
- You want a Rockschool?
- Yeah.

30:24.632 --> 30:26.966
Five double Jack and Coke, please, darling.

30:26.967 --> 30:30.103
- What are they called?
- The Songbirds. You get it?

30:30.104 --> 30:31.834
Fucking girl power and all that bollocks.

30:37.144 --> 30:39.079
- See Roger's celebrating.
- How's that?

30:39.613 --> 30:41.104
Well, I hear he's your new head of A&R.

30:42.383 --> 30:43.850
Where are you hearing that?

30:43.851 --> 30:46.019
Derek's PA let it slip to Ted
in my office earlier on.

30:46.020 --> 30:47.113
I think he's gonna get it.

30:48.389 --> 30:49.722
Thank you, darling.

30:49.723 --> 30:51.991
Two, three...

30:51.992 --> 30:53.085
Keep the change, all right?

30:53.360 --> 30:54.191
Stevie.

30:55.129 --> 30:56.863
Enjoy. I'll give you a bell about the band.

30:56.864 --> 30:58.230
- Yeah.
- Sorry, darling.

31:03.003 --> 31:07.106
Sometimes, as a mantra to calm myself
during moments of stress or anxiety,

31:07.107 --> 31:10.600
I find it soothing to repeat all
the different words I know for cocaine.

31:11.245 --> 31:14.147
Gak, chang, nose-up, bag, beak, charlie,

31:14.148 --> 31:16.149
krell, powder, chisel, bump,

31:16.150 --> 31:18.017
posh, bugle, sniff, skiwear...

31:18.018 --> 31:21.387
That's the problem with chasing
these one-off dance records, you know.

31:21.388 --> 31:23.084
The stakes are so high.

31:23.624 --> 31:25.354
I mean, sometimes you...

31:26.961 --> 31:32.098
You know, that's why I think
it'll be a good thing, David going, you know.

31:32.099 --> 31:35.501
It'll give us a chance
to have a proper A&R department

31:35.502 --> 31:38.104
where we sign some real artists with longevity,

31:38.105 --> 31:42.702
you know,
great British songwriters like, say...

31:44.845 --> 31:46.336
You know, say...

31:46.847 --> 31:48.481
- Paul Weller?
- Yeah.

31:48.482 --> 31:50.576
I mean,
he writes most of his own stuff, doesn't he?

31:54.388 --> 31:56.357
Yeah, yeah, I believe he does.

32:01.095 --> 32:02.927
Roger, why are you talking like this?

32:03.364 --> 32:06.459
Why are you banging on about
your vision for the department?

32:08.369 --> 32:11.806
- I don't know, man.
- Have they offered you David's job?

32:17.244 --> 32:19.804
Derek told me not to say anything.

32:21.615 --> 32:22.810
Trellick doesn't even know yet.

32:25.486 --> 32:26.853
It's no reflection on you, Steven.

32:26.854 --> 32:29.489
It's just it's not great timing for you,

32:29.490 --> 32:32.460
you know, after what happened
with Rudi's dance track and...

32:33.494 --> 32:36.863
You know, I don't want it to seem
like you're suddenly working for me.

32:36.864 --> 32:39.098
We're working together.

32:39.099 --> 32:42.001
Racket, bink, bump, bronson,

32:42.002 --> 32:44.604
bolivian, toot, junior,

32:44.605 --> 32:46.606
chas, nonsense, bounce...

32:46.607 --> 32:49.242
Well, congratulations. Well done, mate.

32:49.243 --> 32:51.244
- Fucking result.
- Thanks.

32:51.245 --> 32:52.076
You got any more champagne?

32:53.080 --> 32:55.208
It's in the fridge.

32:59.486 --> 33:02.989
Obviously I'd be lying if I said I hadn't
thought about running the department before.

33:02.990 --> 33:05.960
I mean, let's be honest,
David was all over the place.

33:06.260 --> 33:07.592
He was too old.

33:07.962 --> 33:10.630
He never got a sense of
what he really liked and didn't like.

33:10.631 --> 33:14.124
It was just about seeing whatever deals were
hot and then getting in on it at the last minute.

33:14.969 --> 33:16.102
It's like with Rage, remember,

33:16.103 --> 33:18.504
it was you that brought that in,
Steven, and now I'm in charge,

33:18.505 --> 33:21.607
I'm gonna make sure things like that
get properly recognised, you know.

33:21.608 --> 33:25.611
You should have had a point on that album
and in the future, I know we can,

33:25.612 --> 33:28.481
we definitely need to broaden the roster,
you know.

33:28.482 --> 33:30.678
We need to find a band like Supergrass...

33:30.751 --> 33:32.481
<i>Smack my bitch up</i>

34:00.014 --> 34:01.209
Fucking die!

34:06.387 --> 34:11.090
Of course Paul Weller writes his own songs,
you stupid fat bastard.

34:11.091 --> 34:15.222
Of the foremost singer/songwriters
of his generation!

34:15.629 --> 34:19.364
I mean, who gives a fuck about the mod cunt?

34:19.366 --> 34:25.931
But he's primarily known as
a singer fucking songwriter.

34:42.022 --> 34:43.820
Nice.

34:49.129 --> 34:51.063
Who would you say your influences are?

34:54.134 --> 34:56.735
I think he's asking what music you like.

34:56.737 --> 34:59.739
- Madonna and stuff.
- You don't even like Madonna.

34:59.740 --> 35:01.007
Your breath stinks.

35:01.008 --> 35:04.110
- I'm also a rap singer.
- Girls...

35:04.111 --> 35:05.841
- Really?
- Sorry, mate.

35:06.246 --> 35:07.077
Can we leave this till later?

35:07.981 --> 35:09.813
- You're giving me a fucking headache.
- Great.

35:10.250 --> 35:12.852
Well, Danny, let me get back to you, yeah?

35:12.853 --> 35:14.087
All right, be quick, though.

35:14.088 --> 35:16.122
- We're up at Virgin this afternoon.
- Cheers, Danny.

35:16.123 --> 35:17.819
Come on, girls. Let's go.

35:18.859 --> 35:21.090
- Nice meeting you
- Cheers. Thanks, girls.

35:32.139 --> 35:33.606
What d'you reckon to that lot, then?

35:33.607 --> 35:34.607
What do I reckon?

35:34.608 --> 35:38.377
I reckon they look like the worst kind
of sink-estate benefit-fraud trash imaginable,

35:38.378 --> 35:41.981
and to say that their music is dismal
would be an understatement on par

35:41.982 --> 35:45.251
with saying Fred West could probably
have been a better fucking dad.

35:45.252 --> 35:48.087
But I'd also like to do the lot of them.

35:48.088 --> 35:51.090
I reckon if we got some real songwriters,
decent producer,

35:51.091 --> 35:53.092
world-class stylist, an A-list photographer

35:53.093 --> 35:58.030
and some personal trainers to keep
them off the KFC and the alcopops...

35:58.031 --> 35:59.732
and if we spent a fortune on the right pluggers

35:59.733 --> 36:02.368
and press officers to convince people
they're the real deal,

36:02.369 --> 36:04.737
rather than just a talentless bunch of slags

36:04.738 --> 36:07.373
who'd gobble a fucking donkey
to get to meet Mark Morrison,

36:07.374 --> 36:10.743
then, yeah, Rebecca,
we might just sell a few fucking records.

36:10.744 --> 36:12.979
Have you guys heard about Roger?

36:12.980 --> 36:15.848
Yeah, where is that clown?
He hasn't been in for three fucking days now.

36:15.849 --> 36:17.044
He's dead.

36:18.852 --> 36:19.581
What?

36:21.622 --> 36:24.956
Someone beat him to death... in his flat.

36:26.026 --> 36:26.721
Fuck.

36:28.629 --> 36:29.597
Holy shit.

36:32.266 --> 36:34.132
They even killed his little dog.

36:38.872 --> 36:41.706
Here. It's OK. It's OK.

36:47.147 --> 36:49.582
The police think he disturbed an intruder.

36:50.250 --> 36:51.218
Poor Roger.

36:51.485 --> 36:52.578
Jesus.

36:53.020 --> 36:56.389
Right, so you'll be acting
head of A&R for the time being.

36:56.390 --> 36:58.991
The scouts and Rob
will report to you temporarily.

36:58.992 --> 37:01.260
Now, what are we gonna do
about this fucking Rage album?

37:01.261 --> 37:03.355
Christ, let's just drop the talentless clown.

37:07.000 --> 37:09.799
Look into what it'll cost us
to get out of the deal, James.

37:10.270 --> 37:13.069
The point is, Steven, we're dead in the water.

37:13.840 --> 37:15.374
We need some activity.

37:15.375 --> 37:18.244
You're off to Austin for South
By Southwest this week, right?

37:18.245 --> 37:19.146
Yeah, me and Darren.

37:19.147 --> 37:20.580
We're gonna see a lot of new bands.

37:21.081 --> 37:23.209
OK. Good.

37:24.084 --> 37:25.074
Watch the expenses.

37:25.619 --> 37:26.348
Thanks, Derek.

37:27.087 --> 37:29.454
I mean, this wasn't how I wanted to get the job...

37:30.857 --> 37:32.223
You haven't got the job yet.

37:32.960 --> 37:34.326
We'll see how it goes, OK?

37:39.266 --> 37:41.500
Christ. What's that bender's problem?

37:41.501 --> 37:44.003
I mean, apart from the fucking AIDS
coursing through his veins.

37:44.004 --> 37:47.373
- Same problem it always is.
- We need some hits.

37:47.374 --> 37:48.975
Correctos.

37:48.976 --> 37:53.079
Katy, can you dig out
Roger's contract for me, please?

37:53.080 --> 37:55.208
And ring Simon Esplen
and cancel lunch tomorrow.

37:56.617 --> 37:57.346
Thank you.

38:00.621 --> 38:01.452
Steven.

38:01.989 --> 38:02.718
Steven.

38:03.090 --> 38:07.585
Look, come back from Texas with some
hot new bands and you'll be golden.

38:08.095 --> 38:09.586
Christ. I fucking hate bands.

38:10.030 --> 38:12.590
We all do, Steven. We all do.

38:14.268 --> 38:15.968
Acting head of A&R

38:15.969 --> 38:17.503
The fucking insult.

38:17.504 --> 38:20.373
Still, it might be a good
opportunity to make a mark,

38:20.374 --> 38:22.842
to stamp my taste on the department.

38:22.843 --> 38:24.377
So I suppose you're wondering,

38:24.378 --> 38:25.611
what is that taste,

38:25.612 --> 38:27.613
what kind of music do I like?

38:27.614 --> 38:31.250
Asking a major label A&R man
this is like asking a stockbroker

38:31.251 --> 38:33.085
what his favourite commodity is,

38:33.086 --> 38:37.123
or saying to an FX trader,
'Hey, what's your favourite currency?'

38:37.124 --> 38:40.726
The answer is: whatever's profitable.

38:40.727 --> 38:42.261
Hip-hop, trance,

38:42.262 --> 38:45.364
Bulgarian heavy metal played
on sheep's bladders.

38:45.365 --> 38:50.326
If it's a hit, who fucking cares,
as long as it's profitable.

39:02.616 --> 39:04.949
Hey. We'll catch up later

39:35.382 --> 39:38.079
The truth is, signing bands is a lottery.

39:42.723 --> 39:48.321
But now and then, once in a while,
you do witness something new, fresh,

39:49.863 --> 39:51.229
like fucking snow.

39:51.498 --> 39:54.867
And then you've got your work cut out,
because then the race is on,

39:54.868 --> 39:58.270
because if you sign a proper band
with songs and longevity,

39:58.271 --> 40:00.106
with sales and credibility,

40:00.107 --> 40:03.077
then you get known as
that ultimate A&R accolade.

40:03.143 --> 40:06.846
You are a music guy, someone with good ears.

40:06.847 --> 40:09.578
You're a man of taste and discernment,
a man like...

40:10.851 --> 40:13.343
Anthony Parker fucking Hall.

40:18.625 --> 40:20.116
All right, ladies and gentlemen...

40:23.363 --> 40:24.264
Why don't I know about this band?

40:24.265 --> 40:25.498
Everyone bloody loves them.

40:25.499 --> 40:26.999
I told you, The Lazies from Sweden.

40:27.000 --> 40:30.095
Bollocks did you.
Fucking Rebecca's been banging on about them.

40:30.737 --> 40:32.271
That cunt Parker Hall's all over them.

40:32.272 --> 40:34.106
- Who's the manager?
- Some guy called Jimmy Sien.

40:34.107 --> 40:35.374
They're coming over to London next week.

40:35.375 --> 40:37.105
Right, sort out a meeting, for fuck's sake.

40:38.979 --> 40:40.572
I think it's Stein, actually. Jimmy Stein.

40:41.148 --> 40:42.982
I don't fucking care.
Just sort out the meeting.

40:42.983 --> 40:43.951
Yeah.

40:49.022 --> 40:51.023
The Lazies. I don't believe this.

40:51.024 --> 40:52.124
Where is their CD?

40:52.125 --> 40:54.493
I mean, I've been going on about
that band for months and now suddenly...

40:54.494 --> 40:56.262
Yeah, but now they're fucking hot, Rebecca.

40:56.263 --> 40:58.061
That's life.

41:00.600 --> 41:02.134
- Steven?
- Hi, Derek.

41:02.135 --> 41:03.831
- Is he there?
- Yes. Hang on.

41:06.139 --> 41:06.840
Derek.

41:06.841 --> 41:08.107
- That you?
- Yeah.

41:08.108 --> 41:10.009
Phonogram are about to make
an offer on the fucking Lazies.

41:10.010 --> 41:12.244
No, I know Phonogram are offering, and Island.

41:12.245 --> 41:13.746
- Well, are we meeting them?
- Yeah.

41:13.747 --> 41:15.614
- Today?
- No. They've just got into the country.

41:15.615 --> 41:17.249
Me and Darren are having dinner
with them later in the week.

41:17.250 --> 41:20.119
- We've got to get this, Steven.
- We're gonna get this fucking deal.

41:20.120 --> 41:21.487
- OK?
- Yes.

41:21.488 --> 41:24.089
- Great. Bye.
- OK, yeah. Bye, bye, bye. Bye.

41:24.090 --> 41:26.685
Now, where is their fucking CD?

41:27.961 --> 41:30.089
- Been promoted again?
- Fuck off.

41:30.964 --> 41:32.264
Look, call Rough Trade.

41:32.265 --> 41:33.365
Get one biked over.

41:33.366 --> 41:35.134
- About the Lazies deal...
- Jesus.

41:35.135 --> 41:36.368
I just had Derek on the phone.

41:36.369 --> 41:38.370
Apparently Independiente
are in the frame as well.

41:38.371 --> 41:41.933
- Two firm, 150 grand per album.
- Oh, fuck. You're kidding me?

41:42.843 --> 41:45.144
Steven, there's someone in reception to see you.

41:45.145 --> 41:46.479
Tell them to fuck off.

41:46.480 --> 41:48.848
Actually, I wouldn't do that.

41:48.849 --> 41:49.407
It's a policeman.

41:50.617 --> 41:52.051
Hello. Rough Trade.

41:58.024 --> 42:00.721
- Is that for the Rage album?
- Yeah.

42:01.495 --> 42:04.055
Wow. My wife bought that.

42:05.966 --> 42:08.601
Yeah, not really my kind of thing,
to tell you the truth.

42:08.602 --> 42:10.603
I'm more into the guitar stuff.

42:10.604 --> 42:14.939
Played in a band until a few years ago,
sent a few demos off back in the day.

42:15.509 --> 42:18.479
The usual 'not what we're looking
for at the moment' replies.

42:19.846 --> 42:21.247
Well, it's tough trying
to get your foot in the door.

42:21.248 --> 42:23.082
- Sorry, Detective...?
- Woodham.

42:23.083 --> 42:26.151
Right. I'm just a little bit busy right now, so...

42:26.152 --> 42:28.087
Righty ho.

42:28.488 --> 42:33.449
Anyway, as I said, I'm just following up
on a few things relating to Mr Waters' murder.

42:34.027 --> 42:36.587
I believe you were with him on
the last night he was seen alive.

42:36.863 --> 42:38.964
Yeah. We'd been at the Brits.

42:38.965 --> 42:41.093
We shared a cab.
I dropped him off on the way back to mine.

42:41.868 --> 42:42.597
Right.

42:47.007 --> 42:48.031
What were the Brits like?

42:48.241 --> 42:49.436
Usual nonsense.

42:51.144 --> 42:53.746
Yeah, I mean,
I've seen it on the telly and that, but...

42:53.747 --> 42:56.382
I imagine it's different
when you're, you know, actually there.

42:56.383 --> 42:57.214
Yeah.

43:03.623 --> 43:06.725
Did Mr Waters have any problems
that you knew about?

43:06.726 --> 43:09.128
- Like what?
- Debts, for instance.

43:09.129 --> 43:12.264
- Or did he have any enemies?
- Probably a few enemies.

43:12.265 --> 43:14.359
You have to say no to people an awful lot.

43:15.268 --> 43:16.268
Tell me about it.

43:16.269 --> 43:18.270
I mean, he's unlikely
to have had any money worries.

43:18.271 --> 43:20.831
Expenses all the way
in your bloody racket, isn't it?

43:22.008 --> 43:24.443
Yeah, we have been known
to claim a few beers back.

43:26.613 --> 43:28.946
- You'd been drinking that night?
- It was the Brits

43:29.015 --> 43:31.075
- Drugs?
- Not for me, no.

43:34.020 --> 43:36.353
There's evidence of cocaine use at the scene.

43:37.123 --> 43:39.858
Significant levels of the drug
in Mr Waters' body.

43:39.859 --> 43:40.383
Really?

43:42.028 --> 43:44.096
To be honest, I thought all you guys...

43:44.097 --> 43:45.965
That's a myth.

43:45.966 --> 43:47.696
It's not the '80s.
You have to work too hard these days.

43:51.738 --> 43:52.606
Sorry, Steven.

43:52.607 --> 43:54.939
Derek wants you to go up and
discuss The Lazies offer.

43:55.976 --> 43:58.707
The Lazies? Great single, that.

43:59.512 --> 44:01.480
Christ. Tell him we'll just...

44:01.481 --> 44:04.041
No, no, it's fine. I'm done.

44:05.619 --> 44:09.388
- Thanks for your time, Mr Stelfox.
- No, thank you.

44:09.389 --> 44:11.857
Sorry I couldn't be more help, you know.

44:11.858 --> 44:14.350
If there's anything else I can help with,
then just give me a call.

44:16.496 --> 44:17.327
Thanks.

44:19.633 --> 44:23.729
Actually, there is one more thing.

44:26.139 --> 44:27.573
Can you tell me what you make of this?

44:34.848 --> 44:37.943
It's just some rough mixes
we did at my mate's place.

44:38.985 --> 44:40.119
I was the songwriter, you see.

44:40.120 --> 44:42.855
I'd love a professional opinion.

44:42.856 --> 44:44.222
Sure. I'll have a listen.

44:45.025 --> 44:45.958
Great.

44:49.629 --> 44:51.222
- All finished?
- Absolutely.

44:55.969 --> 44:57.062
What was all that about?

44:57.871 --> 44:59.100
He was asking about Roger.

44:59.606 --> 45:01.575
I told him Id dropped him off
on the way home after the Brits.

45:03.009 --> 45:04.944
What's with this?

45:05.011 --> 45:07.708
Starstruck copper reckons
he's Noel fucking Gallagher.

45:08.081 --> 45:11.383
- He's quite cute, though.
- Fancy that, do you, Rebecca?

45:11.384 --> 45:14.853
Being married to some cretin who earns
25 grand a year and wears Next suits,

45:14.854 --> 45:17.346
tooling around B&Q on
a Sunday buying fucking tiles?

45:17.724 --> 45:20.694
- Well, if you're in love...
- Don't make me laugh.

45:22.028 --> 45:24.129
Where are you gonna take
The Lazies for dinner?

45:24.130 --> 45:25.264
I don't care.

45:25.265 --> 45:27.266
Just find somewhere that's vegetarian-friendly.

45:27.267 --> 45:28.701
Vegan, actually.

45:29.602 --> 45:30.869
Well, what's their fucking deal, then?

45:30.870 --> 45:32.361
No animal products whatsoever.

45:33.106 --> 45:35.374
No fish, no dairy, no eggs.

45:35.375 --> 45:36.707
Fucking indie kids.

45:38.144 --> 45:39.339
How d'you wanna play this?

45:40.380 --> 45:42.247
You be the enthusiastic music lover,

45:42.248 --> 45:46.852
bang on about indie B sides and the guitar
solos of Tom fucking Verlaine or whatever,

45:46.853 --> 45:49.448
and I'll do the industry thing when
they say, 'Tell us about the label'.

45:50.724 --> 45:52.818
- Hey.
- With indie kids, you have to remember this.

45:53.026 --> 45:55.723
They really think that
what they do matters in some way.

45:55.962 --> 45:57.129
They reckon that history will care,

45:57.130 --> 46:00.599
that they're passing on the torch
and just as they were influenced by someone,

46:00.600 --> 46:03.736
then in the future young bands
will be influenced by them.

46:03.737 --> 46:05.370
The fucking arrogance of it all.

46:05.371 --> 46:07.506
- May I get you some drinks?
- Yes.

46:07.507 --> 46:08.741
Could you bring us the vodka menu?

46:08.742 --> 46:10.242
You guys have to check this out.
They've got over 30...

46:10.243 --> 46:11.744
Can I just have some more water, please?

46:11.745 --> 46:13.011
Yeah, me too.

46:13.012 --> 46:15.811
We've got an early start tomorrow, so...

46:15.849 --> 46:17.078
Fine. Thank you.

46:21.121 --> 46:24.057
So, what's your favourite track on the EP?

46:25.492 --> 46:26.460
Track 3.

46:27.093 --> 46:28.727
Right. Wow.

46:28.728 --> 46:32.096
- Great.
- So, guys, tell us about your label.

46:36.136 --> 46:37.331
Me? Sure.

46:37.971 --> 46:41.240
Well, as you know,
we'll manufacture your records

46:41.241 --> 46:43.676
and put them in the shops and that's about it.

46:44.010 --> 46:47.479
We'll interfere at every conceivable
stage of the artistic process.

46:47.480 --> 46:50.015
We'll remix and edit tracks
without your permission

46:50.016 --> 46:53.719
and force you to appear
on degrading kids' TV programmes

46:53.720 --> 46:56.255
when you're hung over to fuck
at nine o'clock in the morning.

46:56.256 --> 46:59.992
We'll use your music to advertise
banks and petrochemical giants.

46:59.993 --> 47:05.264
We'd use it to advertise arms dealers and
whaling fleets if only the cunts advertised on TV.

47:05.265 --> 47:06.498
We'll under-account to you

47:06.499 --> 47:10.002
and charge you for everything
from that disgraceful fucking tofu

47:10.003 --> 47:14.373
you're about to order to the staples used
to knock your horrendous contracts together.

47:14.374 --> 47:15.741
And if it doesn't all work out,

47:15.742 --> 47:18.377
you'll be dropped faster
than a Plymouth hooker's knickers

47:18.378 --> 47:20.210
when there's a big fucking ship in town.

47:21.014 --> 47:22.014
How's that?

47:22.015 --> 47:25.713
Strap that on for a laugh,
you vegan hippy cunts.

47:33.960 --> 47:35.127
Me? Sure.

47:35.128 --> 47:40.732
Well, as you know, we're very much
about long-term artist development.

47:40.733 --> 47:43.969
You know, we wanna make you guys
feel comfortable and make you happy that

47:43.970 --> 47:45.233
you're producing the sort of music...

47:46.105 --> 47:49.234
Come on! I'm the fucking king.

47:57.851 --> 48:00.085
Come on! I'm the fucking king!

48:00.086 --> 48:01.987
When he goes up the octave,
it's just... it's magical.

48:01.988 --> 48:03.856
- Incredible.
- It's so incredible.

48:03.857 --> 48:05.052
- I mean, you play...?
- Drums

48:06.092 --> 48:07.583
No, we're just...

48:08.862 --> 48:09.591
We're...

48:11.965 --> 48:13.934
Excuse me. I'll be back in a second.

48:14.868 --> 48:18.136
All righty. Anyone for dessert
or shall we go for a nightcap?

48:18.137 --> 48:20.606
Actually, I think we're gonna
hit the road now.

48:20.607 --> 48:22.507
Come on. The night is young.

48:22.508 --> 48:26.745
OK, all right. Well, I'll get our lawyer
to give your guy a call.

48:26.746 --> 48:28.847
Yeah, great. See you at the show.

48:28.848 --> 48:30.942
Yeah, Saturday. Wouldn't miss it.

48:31.985 --> 48:34.352
Hey, are you sure you don't fancy a drink?

48:34.988 --> 48:36.121
Sorry. I'm really tired.

48:36.122 --> 48:39.091
Yes, I know this private members club you
and me could...

48:39.092 --> 48:41.061
Are you like hitting on me?

48:41.361 --> 48:44.092
- No.
- Look, thanks again for dinner.

48:44.631 --> 48:45.462
Good night.

48:56.109 --> 48:56.940
That went well.

49:02.982 --> 49:05.816
3 days later and still no response
to our offer on The Lazies.

49:06.486 --> 49:10.446
With each passing day, they are becoming
the hottest unsigned band in the country.

49:11.024 --> 49:15.724
Whoever gets their signature is gonna look
like Clive fucking Davis with a six-foot cock.

49:17.030 --> 49:18.054
So what do you do?

49:18.364 --> 49:21.099
You follow the circus to the next town
and stand at the back,

49:21.100 --> 49:23.969
nodding along with all the other
clowns like you give a shit.

49:23.970 --> 49:26.064
Mr Stelfox. Hey.

49:26.973 --> 49:27.804
Hi.

49:29.142 --> 49:31.843
It's Alan Woodham, DC Woodham.
I interviewed you about...

49:31.844 --> 49:34.939
Yeah. Christ, sorry.
I didn't recognise you in your civvies.

49:35.381 --> 49:38.078
- What are you doing here?
- I still like to get out to a few gigs.

49:38.618 --> 49:40.951
I heard good things about this lot.
What did you think?

49:41.854 --> 49:42.947
Yeah, interesting.

49:44.490 --> 49:46.258
Any progress with the investigation?

49:46.259 --> 49:47.626
Not really.

49:47.627 --> 49:49.357
None of the neighbours saw anything.

49:50.730 --> 49:54.733
So, what did you think of my demo?

49:54.734 --> 49:56.464
Be frank. I can take it.

49:57.603 --> 50:00.198
Actually, I have to say, I was really impressed.

50:01.007 --> 50:02.240
- Really?
- Yeah, yeah.

50:02.241 --> 50:03.573
There's some great songs on there.

50:04.243 --> 50:07.680
- What was your favourite?
- Track 3.

50:07.981 --> 50:09.711
- Time Keeps Moving.
- Yeah.

50:10.383 --> 50:12.384
Thanks for taking the time to have a listen.

50:12.385 --> 50:13.719
I mean, don't get me wrong,

50:13.720 --> 50:17.389
I'm not harbouring any delusions
about becoming a rock star at 30,

50:17.390 --> 50:22.829
but I did think with the song writing
maybe I could look at getting a publishing deal,

50:23.096 --> 50:24.462
you know, write songs for other people.

50:27.100 --> 50:27.829
Yeah.

50:30.737 --> 50:35.198
Do you know any publishers
who it might be worth sending it to?

50:37.744 --> 50:39.745
Yes, yeah. Look, I've gotta run.

50:39.746 --> 50:41.980
But let me have a think and
I'll give you a call, OK?

50:41.981 --> 50:43.574
- Thanks, Steven.
- Cheers, Alan.

51:03.002 --> 51:04.937
I love you, London!

51:08.141 --> 51:09.741
Thank you so much.

51:09.742 --> 51:12.075
You've been amazing.

51:14.247 --> 51:17.217
- Fuck a dog.
- Is that... Is that Parker Hall?

51:18.251 --> 51:21.949
Would it be fair to say Parker Hall's some
what closer with the band than we are?

51:22.989 --> 51:25.117
- When the going gets tough...
- What, the tough do Es?

51:26.025 --> 51:29.052
Fucking indie band.
There'll be another one along in a minute.

51:38.371 --> 51:42.374
But, I can get you a deal
if that's what you want.

51:42.375 --> 51:44.207
I can do a deal.

51:48.381 --> 51:50.749
I can get you a deal.

51:50.750 --> 51:53.251
You should call me. Give me a call.

51:53.252 --> 51:54.986
Who is Darren talking to?

51:54.987 --> 51:57.218
Yeah? I'm the deal maker.

51:58.491 --> 52:00.323
He's literally talking to the wall.

52:00.960 --> 52:02.929
I think he's offering it a record deal.

52:05.131 --> 52:07.566
That last double drop was an own goal, mate.

52:09.969 --> 52:11.002
Do you want a deal?

52:11.003 --> 52:12.801
I guess you can have a deal.

52:14.240 --> 52:17.843
Just give me your address.
Send me a signal. OK.

52:17.844 --> 52:19.574
- Next door.
- What?

52:20.012 --> 52:21.105
How do you know my mum?

52:21.981 --> 52:22.812
Will you give me a sec?

52:29.856 --> 52:31.688
Get some water down you, Darren.

52:41.367 --> 52:42.926
Strap yourselves in, lads.

52:44.003 --> 52:46.972
Looks like we're gonna be signing
The Lazies after all.

52:46.973 --> 52:50.102
Come on. I'm the fucking king.

52:50.376 --> 52:56.577
Well... Parker Hall is actually signing them.

52:59.986 --> 53:05.118
The band won't sign with anyone else
but Parker Hall.

53:10.096 --> 53:13.865
It seems Derek's been talking
to Parker Hall for a while.

53:13.866 --> 53:15.960
He had breakfast with him this morning.

53:17.136 --> 53:19.230
His contract is up at EMI

53:20.139 --> 53:23.234
and he's coming straight over
to us to be head of A&R.

53:27.480 --> 53:28.573
I don't understand.

53:32.385 --> 53:35.947
Derek has hired Parker Hall.

53:37.123 --> 53:40.218
He's going to be our new head of A&R

53:41.494 --> 53:44.828
and he's bringing The Lazies
in with him as his first signing.

53:46.732 --> 53:48.462
He's your fucking boss.

53:53.606 --> 53:57.338
As you all know, this has been
a very difficult year for this company.

53:57.843 --> 54:03.578
What with Roger's tragic death
and David Schneider's decision to move on,

54:04.383 --> 54:09.583
we have been missing certain leadership
in the A&R department.

54:10.022 --> 54:12.390
Well, I'm very pleased to say
that's all about to change.

54:12.391 --> 54:16.628
As we all know,
in A&R your reputation is everything.

54:16.629 --> 54:19.264
With a great reputation, you attract talent,

54:19.265 --> 54:21.962
and with talent, you get hits,

54:23.102 --> 54:26.470
and with hits, you build a successful label.

54:28.107 --> 54:31.475
And this man here has an incredible reputation,

54:32.845 --> 54:37.215
established at EMI where he had
tremendous success with Ellie Crush.

54:37.750 --> 54:41.119
I have personally been trying to get him
to work here for a very long time now

54:41.120 --> 54:43.680
and I'm delighted to say
he's finally accepted.

54:45.391 --> 54:48.589
Please welcome our new head of A&R,
Anthony Parker Hall.

54:57.970 --> 55:02.374
I'm not one for big speeches,
so I will just say how excited I am to be here...

55:02.375 --> 55:03.809
I'm walking in a forest.

55:04.243 --> 55:06.511
I'm walking in a forest.

55:06.512 --> 55:10.472
- I'm walking in a forest.
- No. No, it's pony. Take it off, Darren.

55:11.384 --> 55:12.943
Welcome to the new regime.

55:13.619 --> 55:16.388
OK, this is Cocoa and the Bean,
Edinburgh band.

55:16.389 --> 55:17.856
There's a few people talking about them.

55:17.857 --> 55:19.991
A&R meetings are
now weekly under Parker Hall

55:19.992 --> 55:22.127
rather than whenever
we felt like it under Schneider.

55:22.128 --> 55:24.863
They're also driven by a new focus and clarity.

55:24.864 --> 55:28.500
He's on everything early and has a sharp idea
of what he likes and what he doesn't like,

55:28.501 --> 55:30.936
what he thinks will work in
the marketplace and what won't.

55:31.504 --> 55:33.872
And if it's not bad enough
listening to his opinions,

55:33.873 --> 55:35.364
he's now asking for ours.

55:36.108 --> 55:41.342
So, I've been thinking about producers
for the new Lazies album.

55:42.615 --> 55:43.947
Any of you got any bright ideas?

55:46.252 --> 55:47.345
Gil Norton?

55:49.622 --> 55:50.453
Rob?

55:53.626 --> 55:54.594
Who are you thinking of?

55:55.494 --> 55:57.463
- Steve Albini.
- Fuck, that's good.

55:59.365 --> 56:01.966
He produced In Utero, Nirvana's last record.

56:01.967 --> 56:04.102
He just rocks up, box of microphones,
records the band live.

56:04.103 --> 56:05.270
He's thought all this through.

56:05.271 --> 56:07.605
The way I see it,
we've got enough buzz in the band.

56:07.606 --> 56:09.374
We're gonna have a gold record
with this one whatever it sounds like,

56:09.375 --> 56:14.211
so let's just make an extreme record,
establish credibility,

56:15.481 --> 56:17.148
then we make something more commercial
with the second one, yeah?

56:17.149 --> 56:19.384
He isn't really asking
our opinions on anything.

56:19.385 --> 56:21.119
It's just some horrible test.

56:21.120 --> 56:24.489
Do you know how many acts signed
to this company in the last decade

56:24.490 --> 56:26.823
have actually made their third album, anyone?

56:31.731 --> 56:32.562
Zero.

56:33.733 --> 56:37.329
We've got to get into the business
of developing long-term artists.

56:38.137 --> 56:40.505
Everyone here has their own specialties,

56:40.506 --> 56:42.006
so if we can play to those strengths,

56:42.007 --> 56:45.341
we're gonna have this department firing
on all cylinders, yeah?

56:46.011 --> 56:50.210
Rob, that Sound Collective thing you signed,
how many finished tracks do you have?

56:51.851 --> 56:55.447
Steven, I hear you're taking a look at
that girl band Danny Rent's managing.

56:55.721 --> 56:56.814
Songbirds.

56:57.022 --> 56:59.457
Apparently quite a few people are interested.

57:00.393 --> 57:01.361
Should we be doing it?

57:05.264 --> 57:06.232
Do I wanna sign them?

57:07.366 --> 57:08.561
I really don't know.

57:09.268 --> 57:11.828
Signing bands can literally
cost you your fucking job.

57:12.505 --> 57:15.240
Also, I must be mindful of
Parker Hall's intention here.

57:15.241 --> 57:17.742
I mean, you understand
what this little cunt is asking me?

57:17.743 --> 57:19.611
He might be privately convinced that

57:19.612 --> 57:23.049
Songbirds are a grade-A Bernard Matthews
turkey with hobnailed boots on.

57:23.749 --> 57:26.583
He could be doling me out just enough
rope to fashion a fucking noose.

57:27.620 --> 57:28.588
It's win-win for him.

57:29.121 --> 57:30.989
If I sign them and they're huge,

57:30.990 --> 57:33.221
he looks like the king of rock
because he OK'd the deal.

57:33.993 --> 57:36.494
If they go down like the Titanic
with fucking boulders strapped to it,

57:36.495 --> 57:40.732
he'll say something about how he had to give
me the opportunity to make my own mistakes...

57:40.733 --> 57:41.928
and he'll fire me.

57:45.871 --> 57:49.607
On the other hand, if I don't sign them and,
say, Virgin do and they're huge,

57:49.608 --> 57:50.701
then I'm fucked too.

57:51.510 --> 57:52.610
I'm Dick Rowe.

57:52.611 --> 57:55.847
I'm the guy who laid a giant shit
on the Beatles' demo

57:55.848 --> 57:58.616
and mailed it back to them with
little flags sticking out of it saying,

57:58.617 --> 58:01.815
'Go fuck yourselves,
you talentless Scouse bastards.'

58:02.988 --> 58:03.956
It's a nightmare.

58:04.623 --> 58:07.593
Loaded dice and poisoned chalices
all over the fucking shop.

58:09.094 --> 58:10.062
Well, Steven?

58:11.864 --> 58:12.593
Yes or no?

58:21.373 --> 58:23.342
- That's your career over, then.
- Cheers, girls.

58:23.509 --> 58:25.068
- Well done.
- Congratulations.

58:25.244 --> 58:26.845
- Cheers.
- Thank you.

58:26.846 --> 58:29.941
Loaded dice and poisoned
chalices all over the shop.

58:33.486 --> 58:35.921
Just heard from Radio 1. Lazies single...

58:36.388 --> 58:38.256
- Straight in the fucking B list.
- Excellente.

58:38.257 --> 58:40.258
- Seven weeks upfront.
- Right, Tony.

58:40.259 --> 58:41.626
- Let's move on this one.
- All right.

58:41.627 --> 58:43.127
Guys, just give us a minute, yeah?

58:43.128 --> 58:44.262
Thanks, girls.

58:44.263 --> 58:46.232
Really excited. Steven'll see you out.

58:46.499 --> 58:48.132
- Girls, let's go now.
- OK...

58:48.133 --> 58:49.226
Come on, girls.

58:50.102 --> 58:51.229
- Cheers.
- Thank you.

58:54.740 --> 58:56.140
Locked out of the love-in,

58:56.141 --> 59:01.239
success with its thousand fathers
laughing at failure, the lonely orphan.

59:02.248 --> 59:04.046
I really don't like the way this is going.

59:06.986 --> 59:10.255
Gak, chang, bugle, nose-up,

59:10.256 --> 59:12.257
bag, beak, charlie,

59:12.258 --> 59:15.260
krell, chisle, bump, posh, sniff, skiwear,

59:15.261 --> 59:17.495
bronson, bolivian, toot, junior,

59:17.496 --> 59:19.590
chas, bounce, blow.

59:21.367 --> 59:23.368
There's someone to see you.

59:23.369 --> 59:24.337
Fuck tits.

59:25.104 --> 59:27.938
- Hi.
- Can you close the door, please?

59:31.243 --> 59:34.979
Sorry. I've been meaning to call you
about the publishing thing.

59:34.980 --> 59:36.209
Actually, I'm here officially.

59:38.083 --> 59:40.314
Need to talk with you again
in connection with Mr Waters' murder.

59:41.387 --> 59:43.254
Have there been any developments?

59:43.255 --> 59:45.224
You told me you'd been at the Brits...

59:46.625 --> 59:49.861
and you 'dropped him off
on the way back to mine'.

59:49.862 --> 59:50.830
Yeah.

59:54.500 --> 59:56.230
But the Brits were held in Earls Court.

59:57.369 --> 59:59.702
You live in Notting Hill and he lives...

01:00:01.373 --> 01:00:04.571
lived in Maida Vale.

01:00:04.977 --> 01:00:05.808
Yeah.

01:00:06.145 --> 01:00:08.114
- Christ.
- Seems like a long way around.

01:00:09.982 --> 01:00:11.749
Why wouldn't you have been dropped off first?

01:00:11.750 --> 01:00:13.343
Think. Think.

01:00:13.986 --> 01:00:14.954
Did I say that?

01:00:16.855 --> 01:00:17.948
Shit.

01:00:19.625 --> 01:00:21.626
Yeah, no, that was it,
we were gonna drop me off first,

01:00:21.627 --> 01:00:25.129
neither of us had any cash and
I left my wallet in the office.

01:00:25.130 --> 01:00:27.498
So we went back to Roger's place,
he had some cash in the house,

01:00:27.499 --> 01:00:29.695
and, yeah, that was it.

01:00:31.136 --> 01:00:33.230
Sorry. I'd, you know, had a few.

01:00:38.243 --> 01:00:39.040
OK.

01:00:43.849 --> 01:00:46.683
So you were saying something about publishing.

01:00:47.486 --> 01:00:48.818
Yeah, I was.

01:00:51.090 --> 01:00:55.050
I don't think we'll have any trouble getting
a couple of publishers interested in your stuff.

01:00:55.961 --> 01:00:57.962
I was just wondering
if you could get me a few more CDs.

01:00:57.963 --> 01:00:58.692
Sure.

01:01:00.099 --> 01:01:02.600
Great. I will make a few phone calls.

01:01:02.601 --> 01:01:05.332
And I'm sorry about the confusion
with the Roger stuff.

01:01:07.272 --> 01:01:08.240
No problem.

01:01:09.742 --> 01:01:10.710
No problem.

01:01:23.255 --> 01:01:24.587
Fucking hell.

01:01:27.860 --> 01:01:30.591
I don't think the auto-tune's been
built that can handle this lot yet.

01:01:31.130 --> 01:01:33.131
Right, enough's enough Send them home.

01:01:33.132 --> 01:01:34.732
We'll get some session singers in and get it done.

01:01:34.733 --> 01:01:35.564
And listen, Danny,

01:01:36.135 --> 01:01:37.869
I don't give a shit about them
not being on the record,

01:01:37.870 --> 01:01:41.005
but we've gotta do something about
the fucking dance routine for this video.

01:01:41.006 --> 01:01:43.508
Yeah. Choreographer's simplifying it already.

01:01:43.509 --> 01:01:46.946
Simplify it much more and they're just
gonna be standing there fucking wanking.

01:01:48.480 --> 01:01:49.573
Right, girls...

01:01:54.386 --> 01:01:57.255
- For fuck's sake, Danny.
- I'll go sort the talent out.

01:01:57.256 --> 01:01:59.123
The talent, no less.

01:01:59.124 --> 01:02:01.259
Are you talented? Get fucked.

01:02:01.260 --> 01:02:04.495
Go work in a guitar shop
with all the other talented losers.

01:02:04.496 --> 01:02:06.497
Bono, Madonna, the Spice Girls.

01:02:06.498 --> 01:02:09.267
Do you really think any of that lot are talented?

01:02:09.268 --> 01:02:10.501
Don't make me laugh.

01:02:10.502 --> 01:02:12.603
What they are is ambitious.

01:02:12.604 --> 01:02:15.973
I guarantee you that in return
for her 15 minutes of fame,

01:02:15.974 --> 01:02:19.610
someone like Geri Halliwell would have
risen at the crack of dawn every morning

01:02:19.611 --> 01:02:23.981
and swum naked through a river
of HIV positive shark-infested semen

01:02:23.982 --> 01:02:27.151
just to do a 30-second
regional radio interview.

01:02:27.152 --> 01:02:30.953
This is what you want,
you've got a shot with that kind of attitude.

01:02:32.091 --> 01:02:33.582
- Fuck me. What have you come as?
- Fuck off.

01:02:36.729 --> 01:02:38.496
- What's the occasion?
- Lazies launch.

01:02:38.497 --> 01:02:39.864
- What, tonight?
- I told you.

01:02:39.865 --> 01:02:41.834
Cab's booked for eight.

01:02:59.384 --> 01:03:00.579
He's playing a guitar.

01:03:01.253 --> 01:03:02.949
He's jamming with the band.

01:03:18.370 --> 01:03:20.464
Hey, boss.
You might wanna come and look at this.

01:03:23.609 --> 01:03:26.244
<i>Rage, the self-styled drum and bass superstar,</i>

01:03:26.245 --> 01:03:29.682
<i>was rushed to hospital</i>
<i>after a violent altercation...</i>

01:03:29.748 --> 01:03:31.082
What a mess.

01:03:31.083 --> 01:03:33.084
They're saying he might have brain damage.

01:03:33.085 --> 01:03:34.576
Wow. How can they tell?

01:03:36.021 --> 01:03:37.114
You seen this?

01:03:38.624 --> 01:03:43.062
Well, the good news is this might be
our opportunity to rip up his contract.

01:03:46.131 --> 01:03:50.101
Look, I'm...
I'm not one to dance on anyone's grave,

01:03:50.102 --> 01:03:53.371
but... I was never a fan.

01:03:53.372 --> 01:03:54.931
James, we're gonna need you upstairs.

01:03:57.843 --> 01:03:59.675
- Steven.
- Yeah.

01:04:00.012 --> 01:04:01.746
Can I just have a quick word?

01:04:01.747 --> 01:04:02.481
Sure. What's up?

01:04:02.482 --> 01:04:05.750
I've just had Jimmy and Marcy over.

01:04:05.751 --> 01:04:07.481
- Yeah, I heard.
- Yeah.

01:04:08.120 --> 01:04:09.854
It's the launch night,

01:04:09.855 --> 01:04:10.722
it's a big thing for the band,

01:04:10.723 --> 01:04:15.558
and... no offence, mate,
I think it'd be best if you don't come.

01:04:16.728 --> 01:04:17.923
Look, I don't know what happened...

01:04:20.098 --> 01:04:22.226
...but Marcy says she gets a bad vibe off you.

01:04:25.871 --> 01:04:26.964
I can't come anyway.

01:04:27.105 --> 01:04:28.073
Got a gig to go to.

01:04:32.244 --> 01:04:33.576
Right.

01:04:35.147 --> 01:04:36.240
Well, take it easy, yeah?

01:04:37.850 --> 01:04:39.341
- Early flight tomorrow.
- Yep.

01:04:44.089 --> 01:04:47.218
Outflanked, outmanoeuvred, outplayed.

01:04:47.726 --> 01:04:51.686
At the end of the day,
you're either outside or you're inside.

01:04:52.030 --> 01:04:54.829
You do not want to be on the outside.

01:06:07.606 --> 01:06:08.437
Fuck off.

01:07:03.028 --> 01:07:04.587
Jesus Christ.

01:07:06.865 --> 01:07:07.833
Hey, you.

01:07:17.376 --> 01:07:19.572
- Hello.
- I'm in the cab. We're pulling up.

01:07:20.145 --> 01:07:20.942
Are you ready?

01:07:21.847 --> 01:07:23.076
Yeah. I'll be down in two minutes.

01:07:30.122 --> 01:07:31.090
Gotta go to New York.

01:07:32.024 --> 01:07:32.957
I know.

01:07:33.125 --> 01:07:34.457
I booked your hotel and flight.

01:07:38.363 --> 01:07:39.194
Fuck.

01:07:39.965 --> 01:07:40.796
Steven...

01:07:42.968 --> 01:07:44.334
You killed Roger, didn't you?

01:07:57.015 --> 01:07:59.750
I wasn't expecting you to put
in an appearance last night.

01:07:59.751 --> 01:08:01.344
I thought I made myself pretty clear.

01:08:02.621 --> 01:08:07.024
Look, I've got this Lazies meeting
with Ashley Werner tonight,

01:08:07.025 --> 01:08:08.492
so you're gonna have to go
and see this band.

01:08:08.493 --> 01:08:10.325
They're meant to be good.

01:08:10.729 --> 01:08:11.697
Where is it?

01:08:13.265 --> 01:08:15.359
It's out of town a bit,
I think, in Brooklyn.

01:08:16.501 --> 01:08:18.935
And then don't forget
we've got that dinner later.

01:08:19.604 --> 01:08:21.095
All the top brass from the American label.

01:08:21.973 --> 01:08:23.566
It's at that new place downtown.

01:08:23.841 --> 01:08:25.332
- Champagne, sir.
- Thank you.

01:08:25.609 --> 01:08:26.441
There.

01:08:28.145 --> 01:08:29.078
Thanks.

01:08:30.749 --> 01:08:35.118
Listen, this is important, right?

01:08:36.388 --> 01:08:38.357
We've gotta get the Yanks
behind the bands, so...

01:08:39.624 --> 01:08:41.991
just do us a favour and
fucking behave yourself, yeah?

01:08:49.501 --> 01:08:51.602
I have a sense of unravelling,

01:08:51.603 --> 01:08:55.095
of things coming apart, spinning out of control.

01:08:56.140 --> 01:08:58.109
And for the first time I begin to wonder,

01:08:59.111 --> 01:09:00.611
what's it like out there,

01:09:00.612 --> 01:09:03.446
on the other side, in the real world?

01:09:07.486 --> 01:09:08.680
<i>Steven, it's Danny.</i>

01:09:09.354 --> 01:09:11.354
<i>I've got a problem with this video shoot.</i>

01:09:11.356 --> 01:09:13.689
<i>The girls aren't happy with the director.</i>
<i>It's all...</i>

01:09:15.093 --> 01:09:17.323
<i>Hi. It's Rebecca. One other thing.</i>

01:09:17.429 --> 01:09:20.399
<i>I know what you're like,</i>
<i>so I'm gonna put a time limit on this.</i>

01:09:20.465 --> 01:09:23.765
<i>If nothing happens in the next month,</i>
<i>I'm going to start introduc...</i>

01:09:29.241 --> 01:09:32.575
- What?
- You killed Roger, didn't you?

01:09:33.245 --> 01:09:34.337
I don't care about that.

01:09:35.080 --> 01:09:35.911
He was an idiot.

01:09:36.747 --> 01:09:39.946
Even worse at his job than you,
which takes some doing.

01:09:41.019 --> 01:09:41.952
Here's a tip.

01:09:42.487 --> 01:09:44.020
If you're going to kill someone,

01:09:44.022 --> 01:09:46.624
don't have a company cab take
you both back to his flat

01:09:46.625 --> 01:09:50.728
and then call another company cab from
there to take you home a few hours later.

01:09:50.729 --> 01:09:52.322
These people keep records, you know.

01:09:53.131 --> 01:09:54.463
What do you want, Rebecca?

01:09:55.133 --> 01:09:57.830
Advancement, Steven. Same as you.

01:09:58.970 --> 01:10:03.007
If I have to book one more flight,
one more restaurant table, one more hotel,

01:10:03.008 --> 01:10:06.744
so that someone who knows less about music
than me can go tooling round the world,

01:10:06.745 --> 01:10:09.079
getting off their tits,
pissing money up the wall...

01:10:09.080 --> 01:10:11.675
- You're insane.
- You've got no fucking idea.

01:10:13.752 --> 01:10:17.086
I want an entry-level A&R position.

01:10:18.089 --> 01:10:19.580
And I want it pretty fucking quick.

01:10:21.726 --> 01:10:23.695
Parker Hall's been talking
about hiring a new scout.

01:10:25.096 --> 01:10:26.223
You can put my name forward.

01:10:26.631 --> 01:10:29.133
Or you could fire Darren and give me his job.

01:10:29.134 --> 01:10:30.367
You decide.

01:10:30.368 --> 01:10:31.869
You know I'd be good.

01:10:31.870 --> 01:10:34.601
The Lazies.
There's plenty more where that came from.

01:10:36.741 --> 01:10:38.334
You're blackmailing me for a job?

01:10:38.743 --> 01:10:42.339
Correctos.
As you all say in your stupid boys' club.

01:10:44.149 --> 01:10:45.845
So I'd get on it if I were you,

01:10:46.618 --> 01:10:51.056
before I start introducing policemen
to cab controllers.

01:10:52.490 --> 01:10:53.321
OK?

01:11:06.104 --> 01:11:08.664
<i>Mr Stelfox, DC Woodham.</i>

01:11:09.708 --> 01:11:13.804
<i>Look, it's been weeks and you still haven't</i>
<i>got back to me about this publishing deal.</i>

01:11:14.713 --> 01:11:16.306
<i>It's in your interest to call me back about this.</i>

01:11:31.029 --> 01:11:33.864
- Hello?
- Alan. Sorry to call so late.

01:11:33.865 --> 01:11:36.867
- It's Steven.
- Mr Stelfox.

01:11:36.868 --> 01:11:39.003
Listen, about the publishing deal.
I think that...

01:11:39.004 --> 01:11:40.871
Can you tell me why one
of your neighbours claims

01:11:40.872 --> 01:11:45.105
he saw you entering your flat at 5:30am
on the morning of Roger Waters' murder?

01:11:46.244 --> 01:11:48.042
You told me you'd arrived home at midnight.

01:11:50.749 --> 01:11:55.585
I... I got up early to go and get a paper.

01:11:56.621 --> 01:11:57.111
Paper?

01:11:59.124 --> 01:12:01.059
Where did you buy this newspaper?

01:12:03.862 --> 01:12:05.091
It was the corner of Westbourne Grove.

01:12:06.965 --> 01:12:08.092
Alan, is everything all right?

01:12:09.601 --> 01:12:10.694
I don't know.

01:12:12.270 --> 01:12:13.704
Is it?

01:12:14.005 --> 01:12:16.974
I'm sorry it's taking
so long with the demos,

01:12:16.975 --> 01:12:22.937
the publishing deal,
but we will get there, promise.

01:12:23.848 --> 01:12:24.941
Whatever you can do.

01:12:26.251 --> 01:12:29.085
And please let me know in advance
if you're thinking about leaving the country again.

01:12:30.622 --> 01:12:32.215
Yeah, of course. Sorry, I was...

01:12:42.867 --> 01:12:45.969
So, on top of a girl band
who can't sing or dance,

01:12:45.970 --> 01:12:48.505
a policeman who's extorting
a publishing deal out of me

01:12:48.506 --> 01:12:51.108
and a secretary
who is blackmailing me for a job,

01:12:51.109 --> 01:12:55.846
I now have to go to the arse end of
nowhere to see some poxy band.

01:12:55.847 --> 01:12:56.815
Fuck that.

01:13:37.722 --> 01:13:38.451
No, thanks.

01:13:55.240 --> 01:13:56.037
Hey.

01:13:57.375 --> 01:13:58.976
- Hi.
- What was your name again?

01:13:58.977 --> 01:14:00.343
- Emma.
- Emma.

01:14:02.847 --> 01:14:05.849
Emma, you wanna... You wanna do a bump?

01:14:05.850 --> 01:14:07.084
A what?

01:14:07.085 --> 01:14:08.385
A bump. You want some bugle?

01:14:08.386 --> 01:14:10.480
- I don't know what you mean.
- Chang?

01:14:11.389 --> 01:14:12.357
Beak? Bag?

01:14:13.124 --> 01:14:14.258
You want a sniff? Nose-up?

01:14:14.259 --> 01:14:15.726
- Oh, coke.
- Yes.

01:14:15.727 --> 01:14:16.695
No.

01:14:17.729 --> 01:14:18.822
Thank you.

01:14:19.864 --> 01:14:21.355
Fucking Shermans.

01:14:22.133 --> 01:14:24.968
The situation at radio is inherently sexist.

01:14:24.969 --> 01:14:28.972
You go in with a record
with an older female artist,

01:14:28.973 --> 01:14:32.376
like Joni Mitchell or
Marianne Faithfull or Kate Bush,

01:14:32.377 --> 01:14:34.511
and it's uphill battle from the get-go.

01:14:34.512 --> 01:14:39.951
But if it's Clapton or Rod Stewart or whoever,
it's a different story.

01:14:40.852 --> 01:14:42.821
Yeah, it does get harder
for women as they get older.

01:14:43.855 --> 01:14:45.050
I beg your pardon?

01:14:45.123 --> 01:14:48.025
Well, it's like you don't
mind seeing Bowie or Jagger,

01:14:48.026 --> 01:14:49.626
you know, fruiting around at 50 odd.

01:14:49.627 --> 01:14:51.028
There's still a certain charm there.

01:14:51.029 --> 01:14:52.496
Clapton, he's just a muso.

01:14:52.497 --> 01:14:54.865
No one gives a shit what he looks like.

01:14:54.866 --> 01:14:57.367
- But Debbie Harry at 60?
- Steven...

01:14:57.368 --> 01:15:01.738
Cher? Cher at fucking 70 playing
keepy-uppies with her jugs.

01:15:01.739 --> 01:15:04.508
- Face like a melted bucket of concrete, Fuck that.
- Steven.

01:15:04.509 --> 01:15:06.102
No, no cunt needs to be seeing that.

01:15:06.978 --> 01:15:07.946
What?

01:15:08.980 --> 01:15:14.112
What about women who are still producing
important artistically valid work?

01:15:14.853 --> 01:15:17.988
Like... Nanci Griffith or Emmylou Harris

01:15:17.989 --> 01:15:20.117
or... Chrissie Hynde?

01:15:22.026 --> 01:15:24.127
No, I wouldn't fuck any of those cows.

01:15:24.128 --> 01:15:25.963
- Who's this guy?
- Steven!

01:15:25.964 --> 01:15:28.131
Fucking prick!
Who the fuck do you think you are?

01:15:28.132 --> 01:15:29.733
Who hired this guy?

01:15:29.734 --> 01:15:30.868
How dare you!

01:15:30.869 --> 01:15:32.235
Misogynist pig.

01:15:36.241 --> 01:15:37.675
Jesus. You fucking bum.

01:15:59.731 --> 01:16:01.700
<i>Please leave a message after the tone.</i>

01:16:02.467 --> 01:16:04.601
<i>Hey, loser. Where the fuck are you?</i>

01:16:04.602 --> 01:16:05.969
<i>You've been back three days.</i>

01:16:05.970 --> 01:16:08.804
<i>I'd get in here before your old</i>
<i>mucker Parker Hall has a fit.</i>

01:16:10.375 --> 01:16:12.571
<i>Ross has been trying</i>
<i>to get hold of you, by the way.</i>

01:16:13.011 --> 01:16:15.037
<i>Call him back. Call me.</i>

01:16:17.615 --> 01:16:20.210
I'm looking at the karma bank
and it's bad.

01:16:21.619 --> 01:16:22.951
It's fucking bad.

01:16:24.489 --> 01:16:26.583
It's like looking at one of
my own bank statements.

01:16:28.493 --> 01:16:29.461
The tumbling zeroes.

01:16:30.495 --> 01:16:31.262
Overdrawn.

01:16:31.263 --> 01:16:33.697
Debit, debit, debit.

01:17:09.867 --> 01:17:13.463
Maybe the course can be changed,
the karma bank replenished.

01:17:14.739 --> 01:17:17.975
Maybe if I helped old ladies across
the road every day until the end of time.

01:17:17.976 --> 01:17:21.378
Or if I joined the VSO,
went to Africa or somewhere

01:17:21.379 --> 01:17:23.712
and helped swollen-bellied kids build dams.

01:17:24.983 --> 01:17:29.079
Volunteered to drive the buses
that take mongoloids to the seaside.

01:17:29.487 --> 01:17:32.924
Served gruel to skeletal pensioners
in London soup kitchens.

01:17:33.024 --> 01:17:37.120
Or moved to the country and had kids,
ate oatmeal, went running, read books,

01:17:37.629 --> 01:17:40.963
tried to raise them to be
so that they don't...

01:17:43.001 --> 01:17:44.025
...they won't...

01:18:12.730 --> 01:18:13.561
Well?

01:18:15.033 --> 01:18:16.228
Are you gonna let me in?

01:18:18.736 --> 01:18:21.570
- I had some people over.
- Jesus fucking Christ.

01:18:22.974 --> 01:18:25.466
- What are you doing here?
- You've gone AWOL.

01:18:27.111 --> 01:18:30.604
Rebecca's been covering for you,
but people are starting to talk.

01:18:31.983 --> 01:18:35.152
Look, we haven't been working together long...

01:18:35.153 --> 01:18:37.254
Listen, mate, listen,
let's get this straight.

01:18:37.255 --> 01:18:38.450
We're not working together.

01:18:38.990 --> 01:18:40.583
You work for me.

01:18:41.092 --> 01:18:41.923
Right?

01:18:43.127 --> 01:18:47.364
And if you wanna carry on working for me,
you need to get your shit together.

01:18:47.365 --> 01:18:51.268
Then... then, please, get off your nut at dinner,
take the piss out of whoever you want,

01:18:51.269 --> 01:18:53.602
but, I'm telling you,
I'm telling you, Steven,

01:18:54.739 --> 01:18:58.335
you're this fucking close to getting canned.

01:19:09.253 --> 01:19:10.585
You're a smart guy, Steven.

01:19:11.622 --> 01:19:13.955
The label needs someone like you,
because you're sharp.

01:19:14.859 --> 01:19:15.827
Ambitious.

01:19:18.096 --> 01:19:19.223
But you have got lost.

01:19:24.102 --> 01:19:25.468
We're all under pressure.

01:19:26.137 --> 01:19:28.505
You throw enough shit at the wall,
then something'll stick,

01:19:28.506 --> 01:19:29.973
but where's the talent in that?

01:19:29.974 --> 01:19:32.375
You might as well line a bunch
of chancers up on the stage,

01:19:32.376 --> 01:19:34.936
let the public decide
who's gonna be the next number one.

01:19:39.150 --> 01:19:40.118
But that's not the job.

01:19:41.486 --> 01:19:42.317
I mean, John Hammond.

01:19:43.721 --> 01:19:45.690
Ahmet Ertegun. Chris Blackwell.

01:19:47.024 --> 01:19:50.260
Outside the music industry,
no one's even heard of those guys,

01:19:50.261 --> 01:19:52.028
but look at what they gave us.

01:19:52.029 --> 01:19:54.097
Ray Charles,

01:19:54.098 --> 01:19:55.365
Dylan, Led Zeppelin,

01:19:55.366 --> 01:19:56.925
Bob Marley, Springsteen.

01:19:59.103 --> 01:20:02.699
That's the kind of music you measure
across lives, across generations.

01:20:04.509 --> 01:20:07.343
That's why we got into this business.

01:20:11.249 --> 01:20:12.808
What was the first record you ever bought?

01:20:15.620 --> 01:20:17.111
Don't know. I can't...

01:20:19.490 --> 01:20:21.220
Well, mine was The Cutter.

01:20:22.360 --> 01:20:23.692
Echo and the Bunnymen.

01:20:24.028 --> 01:20:26.963
Winter, 1983.

01:20:26.964 --> 01:20:29.266
Well, I mean, that's what I tell the bands.
It was actually...

01:20:29.267 --> 01:20:32.465
It was Rio by Duran Duran.

01:20:34.005 --> 01:20:35.200
That's between you and me.

01:20:39.510 --> 01:20:40.478
It was Blue Monday.

01:20:42.113 --> 01:20:44.344
- New Order. 12 inch vinyl.
- There it is.

01:20:44.382 --> 01:20:46.112
<i>Please leave a message after the tone.</i>

01:20:47.251 --> 01:20:48.048
<i>Steve?</i>

01:20:49.086 --> 01:20:50.054
<i>Steve, you there, man?</i>

01:20:50.855 --> 01:20:52.790
<i>Mate, I need to talk to you about the Songbirds.</i>

01:20:53.825 --> 01:20:54.793
<i>Fucking hell.</i>

01:20:55.126 --> 01:20:56.685
<i>If you're there, pick up the phone!</i>

01:20:58.129 --> 01:20:59.825
Ross.

01:21:04.502 --> 01:21:07.836
...from London, the Big Smoke,
bringing it to the north!

01:21:14.512 --> 01:21:16.479
Some doable beasts up north.

01:21:16.480 --> 01:21:19.382
What, are you gonna tell them
you're a music industry lawyer from London?

01:21:19.383 --> 01:21:21.215
You might as well say you're a fucking astronaut.

01:21:21.986 --> 01:21:23.620
I'm a fucking astronaut.

01:21:23.621 --> 01:21:24.816
This is it. Come on!

01:21:25.990 --> 01:21:26.582
Here we go.

01:21:33.130 --> 01:21:34.223
They're doing the dance.

01:21:36.601 --> 01:21:38.433
It's got its own fucking dance.

01:21:46.143 --> 01:21:48.745
It's not just here.
It's like this all over the country, Steven.

01:21:48.746 --> 01:21:51.944
Haven't seen anything like it
since fucking Whigfield.

01:21:53.384 --> 01:21:55.151
I got blindsided, didn't I?

01:21:55.152 --> 01:21:57.387
Side-tracked by detail and nonsense.

01:21:57.388 --> 01:21:59.256
I lost sight of the big picture.

01:21:59.257 --> 01:22:01.625
Only one thing matters in this racket:

01:22:01.626 --> 01:22:05.262
big hit records, and plenty of them.

01:22:05.263 --> 01:22:07.864
Sort that out and
you can do what you fucking like.

01:22:07.865 --> 01:22:09.733
Right, OK, Songbirds.

01:22:09.734 --> 01:22:12.135
Now, Pandora's on the phone
to Radio 1 about the playlist,

01:22:12.136 --> 01:22:14.971
but as of this week,
the video's one of the most requested on The Box.

01:22:14.972 --> 01:22:16.973
MTV have it on heavy rotation.

01:22:16.974 --> 01:22:19.009
We're starting to get
a lot of interest from the tabloids.

01:22:19.010 --> 01:22:20.610
Congratulations, Steven.

01:22:20.611 --> 01:22:22.612
We knew this one had a shot, eh?

01:22:22.613 --> 01:22:25.105
Result, mate. Well done.

01:22:26.150 --> 01:22:27.083
Cheers.

01:22:27.752 --> 01:22:29.386
So that's why he didn't fire me.

01:22:29.387 --> 01:22:30.854
We'd best get on with the album.

01:22:30.855 --> 01:22:32.448
He knew the track had landed.

01:22:33.024 --> 01:22:35.091
Success is a gangbang,

01:22:35.092 --> 01:22:38.324
lotions, lubricants, cocks all over the shop.

01:22:38.963 --> 01:22:42.058
Failure is a lonely rapist hiding
in the bushes.

01:22:43.868 --> 01:22:45.097
They're all going to pay.

01:22:46.971 --> 01:22:49.566
Everyone is going to fucking pay.

01:23:10.127 --> 01:23:11.095
How far...

01:23:14.098 --> 01:23:15.589
How far are you willing to go?

01:23:17.134 --> 01:23:18.466
You'll be happy, mate.

01:23:19.603 --> 01:23:21.435
You'll be very fucking happy.

01:23:22.006 --> 01:23:24.032
So, any progress?

01:23:24.842 --> 01:23:27.209
Who, me? I was gonna ask you that.

01:23:29.080 --> 01:23:30.810
I have got some news, actually.

01:23:32.083 --> 01:23:34.917
I've found a publisher
who wants to sign you as a songwriter.

01:23:39.724 --> 01:23:42.091
You see, that's the key in this game, Alan.

01:23:42.960 --> 01:23:45.156
Contacts. Loyalty.

01:23:46.130 --> 01:23:48.224
Favours banked and reciprocated.

01:23:49.367 --> 01:23:50.460
You know what I mean?

01:23:55.006 --> 01:23:57.339
It's exactly the same in my game.

01:23:59.844 --> 01:24:00.675
Cheers.

01:24:10.254 --> 01:24:13.023
In every difficult, worthwhile endeavour,

01:24:13.024 --> 01:24:17.627
there will come a point when the easiest
course of action is to abandon forward motion,

01:24:17.628 --> 01:24:21.121
to allow inertia to take over
and return to the status quo.

01:24:26.737 --> 01:24:27.971
- All right?
- Yeah.

01:24:27.972 --> 01:24:30.066
I was just looking for a demo
we were talking about.

01:24:35.980 --> 01:24:37.471
Tony left me some tickets.

01:24:38.482 --> 01:24:39.211
Did he now?

01:24:40.084 --> 01:24:41.211
Anything I should know about?

01:24:42.620 --> 01:24:44.054
No, it's just some band.

01:24:44.255 --> 01:24:46.588
He didn't think they'd be your cup of tea,
so he thought I should check them out.

01:24:53.097 --> 01:24:53.826
Here you go.

01:24:57.134 --> 01:24:58.227
Don't wanna be late.

01:25:03.007 --> 01:25:04.031
See you in the morning.

01:25:05.609 --> 01:25:10.480
It is the brave and great man
who upon recognising this point resists inertia

01:25:10.481 --> 01:25:15.044
and smashes on through to the far side,
no matter the cost.

01:25:15.386 --> 01:25:18.948
I call this juncture
'the critical moment of will'.

01:25:19.490 --> 01:25:21.124
No shit the sluts can't sing, Danny.

01:25:21.125 --> 01:25:23.321
Just tell them it'll have
to be a mimed PA or something.

01:25:23.627 --> 01:25:25.261
The girls aren't gonna be happy
about this, Steven.

01:25:25.262 --> 01:25:27.864
They're kicking off.
We already changed the choreographer

01:25:27.865 --> 01:25:29.094
Just trust me on this, OK?

01:25:34.872 --> 01:25:35.840
There you are.

01:25:37.141 --> 01:25:38.234
What's going on?

01:25:40.611 --> 01:25:43.206
- Strap yourself in.
- For fuck's sake.

01:25:44.482 --> 01:25:46.212
The police arrived about an hour ago.

01:25:46.617 --> 01:25:48.618
No one's been allowed to go upstairs.

01:25:48.619 --> 01:25:51.054
We only know
'cause Jeannie came down and told us.

01:25:51.722 --> 01:25:53.213
For fuck's sake's, mate, what is it?

01:25:53.724 --> 01:25:55.090
Parker Hall's been arrested.

01:25:55.860 --> 01:25:57.727
They found images.

01:25:57.728 --> 01:26:00.363
- On his hard drive.
- Images?

01:26:00.364 --> 01:26:01.195
Kids.

01:26:02.600 --> 01:26:05.195
I mean literally, you know, like babies and stuff.

01:26:08.105 --> 01:26:11.701
I swear to God, Steven,
he's a fucking paedophile.

01:26:18.482 --> 01:26:19.450
How far...

01:26:22.620 --> 01:26:24.213
How far are you willing to go?

01:26:27.258 --> 01:26:29.726
He's going on holiday on the 15th.
I'll tell him then.

01:26:29.727 --> 01:26:31.923
There's no sense having him moping around.

01:26:32.263 --> 01:26:34.731
- I don't want his car.
- What's wrong with Darren's car?

01:26:34.732 --> 01:26:37.967
New car. BMW Compact at least.

01:26:37.968 --> 01:26:39.269
You're hardcore, Rebecca.

01:26:39.270 --> 01:26:41.102
Well, how else is a girl
gonna get on in this business?

01:26:42.106 --> 01:26:43.506
Sit there and do my nails while the bands

01:26:43.507 --> 01:26:46.109
I tip you off about become
the hottest fucking deals in town?

01:26:46.110 --> 01:26:47.601
Cometh the hour, cometh the girl?

01:26:48.746 --> 01:26:50.078
Something like that, yeah.

01:26:52.483 --> 01:26:54.315
How's it going with your cute policeman?

01:26:56.086 --> 01:26:58.254
I'm getting him a publishing deal
would you believe?

01:26:58.255 --> 01:26:58.950
Really?

01:26:59.990 --> 01:27:01.391
Who on earth is signing his publishing?

01:27:01.392 --> 01:27:03.493
- Me.
- Did you listen to his demo?

01:27:03.494 --> 01:27:04.961
- Of course not.
- I did.

01:27:04.962 --> 01:27:05.691
And?

01:27:07.131 --> 01:27:07.928
Cunt.

01:27:08.866 --> 01:27:10.960
Anyway, I think it'll be fine, although...

01:27:12.603 --> 01:27:15.334
I might need a little help in that direction.

01:27:15.873 --> 01:27:17.740
Don't push your luck.

01:27:17.741 --> 01:27:19.334
It's in your interest too.

01:27:20.377 --> 01:27:21.811
My interest, no less?

01:27:23.080 --> 01:27:24.309
You're priceless, Steven.

01:27:28.152 --> 01:27:31.120
Not that he'll notice, but this
is the cheapest champagne in the house.

01:27:31.121 --> 01:27:32.722
The celebration's fake.

01:27:32.723 --> 01:27:33.856
The friends are fake.

01:27:33.857 --> 01:27:36.349
The only real thing at the table
is Woodham's stupid smile.

01:27:36.961 --> 01:27:38.327
Fuck. Excuse me a sec, guys.

01:27:44.501 --> 01:27:46.094
Oi, Mr Stelfox.

01:27:51.742 --> 01:27:54.075
All right, Steven?

01:27:55.246 --> 01:27:56.339
Rage, I...

01:27:57.014 --> 01:27:59.449
He don't talk so good since the accident.

01:28:01.485 --> 01:28:03.044
How are you doing, mate?

01:28:03.387 --> 01:28:06.489
- He just wanted to say hello.
- Yeah.

01:28:06.490 --> 01:28:09.085
- Come on, let's get you cleaned up.
- Yeah.

01:28:15.132 --> 01:28:16.828
- Steven.
- Trellick.

01:28:17.501 --> 01:28:19.602
- Did you drop Rage yet?
- Well, yes.

01:28:19.603 --> 01:28:21.738
No, I mean,
did you actually terminate his contract?

01:28:21.739 --> 01:28:23.506
No, not exactly.

01:28:23.507 --> 01:28:25.508
- Good. Don't.
- What?

01:28:25.509 --> 01:28:28.104
I said do not drop Rage.

01:28:29.013 --> 01:28:30.106
I've got an idea.

01:28:39.623 --> 01:28:41.057
I almost feel sorry for him.

01:28:41.992 --> 01:28:43.722
He thinks this is all really happening.

01:28:47.264 --> 01:28:48.596
The power of dreams.

01:28:50.134 --> 01:28:51.968
When it comes to aspiring musicians,

01:28:51.969 --> 01:28:55.201
there really is no upper limit
to their level of delusion.

01:28:56.740 --> 01:28:57.708
So what's the plan?

01:29:10.854 --> 01:29:13.256
Oh, shit. Fuck.

01:29:13.257 --> 01:29:15.992
I didn't think an officer of the law
would be into this sort of thing.

01:29:15.993 --> 01:29:19.361
More cokeheads in the police than
the bloody music industry, I bet.

01:29:22.366 --> 01:29:24.562
Anyway, 30 grand.

01:29:25.002 --> 01:29:27.938
I know you said it's not a big advance,
but I hardly make that in a year.

01:29:29.740 --> 01:29:30.935
I mean, maybe I'll just quit.

01:29:31.742 --> 01:29:34.610
If I was just writing songs all the time,

01:29:34.611 --> 01:29:36.204
I bet in six months I'd have enough...

01:29:50.961 --> 01:29:51.792
Alan.

01:30:04.241 --> 01:30:05.038
Two?

01:30:05.843 --> 01:30:06.811
For Rebecca.

01:31:14.511 --> 01:31:16.746
Fancy making some drinks, Alan?

01:31:16.747 --> 01:31:17.476
Fuck.

01:31:18.982 --> 01:31:20.814
Yeah, OK.

01:31:26.623 --> 01:31:27.591
Shit.

01:31:38.602 --> 01:31:39.934
You reckon that'll do it?

01:31:41.004 --> 01:31:42.700
He's a married copper with kids.

01:31:43.974 --> 01:31:45.806
I don't think
he'll want this making the rounds.

01:32:05.863 --> 01:32:07.832
I'm gonna enjoy us working together.

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:12.094
You know, you really are hardcore, Rebecca.

01:32:19.510 --> 01:32:22.344
You're either outside or you're inside.

01:32:23.013 --> 01:32:25.812
You do not want to be inside.

01:32:36.493 --> 01:32:37.927
I can't fucking take it.

01:32:38.962 --> 01:32:43.058
Look, you'll make bail in a couple more days.

01:32:43.367 --> 01:32:44.734
A couple more days?

01:32:44.735 --> 01:32:46.226
They think I'm a fucking paedo.

01:32:47.271 --> 01:32:49.968
- Someone's gonna do me.
- Easy. Listen...

01:32:51.742 --> 01:32:54.473
I know this is not great timing.

01:32:59.483 --> 01:33:01.452
But I need to get you to sign this.

01:33:03.253 --> 01:33:08.055
It's just with the potential
publicity surrounding this, we... Derek...

01:33:10.027 --> 01:33:12.963
...thought it would be best
if you took a voluntary leave of absence.

01:33:14.631 --> 01:33:15.826
You know, let the dust settle.

01:33:21.271 --> 01:33:24.740
Listen, you know... you know I had...

01:33:24.741 --> 01:33:26.937
I had nothing to do with
that stuff they found, right?

01:33:37.487 --> 01:33:38.318
Come on.

01:33:47.130 --> 01:33:49.463
Here. I brought you some magazines.

01:33:52.269 --> 01:33:54.238
There's a good review of
The Lazies album in there.

01:34:00.510 --> 01:34:03.105
Hey, it's the least I could do, mate.

01:34:05.015 --> 01:34:06.347
The taste of victory.

01:34:07.250 --> 01:34:09.018
Savour the rusty blood of your enemies,

01:34:09.019 --> 01:34:12.121
but, remember, the true warrior understands

01:34:12.122 --> 01:34:16.359
that war is not a crisis or
an event but a ceaseless state of being.

01:34:16.360 --> 01:34:19.922
Power comes from the relentless
pursuit of the unattainable.

01:34:20.497 --> 01:34:21.590
Oi, oi.

01:34:26.603 --> 01:34:27.696
Listen to this.

01:34:28.271 --> 01:34:29.505
'Rage.'

01:34:29.506 --> 01:34:31.839
'This harrowing, fractured piece,

01:34:32.376 --> 01:34:35.978
is the sound of a man trying
to communicate with an environment

01:34:35.979 --> 01:34:38.346
he has been savagely dislocated from.'

01:34:41.084 --> 01:34:43.853
- We're shipping gold, mate.
- We might just fucking recoup.

01:34:43.854 --> 01:34:45.621
The drum and bass Stephen Hawking,

01:34:45.622 --> 01:34:50.092
the ultimate coffee-table accessory
for today's middle-class spastic.

01:34:50.093 --> 01:34:52.862
Rage, the talentless halfwit.

01:34:52.863 --> 01:34:55.958
The last turkey in the shop
sprouts some fucking wings.

01:34:59.870 --> 01:35:00.701
Well?

01:35:02.739 --> 01:35:04.105
We just got the midweeks.

01:35:05.142 --> 01:35:09.612
It would appear that Songbirds
are number one by a country mile.

01:35:09.613 --> 01:35:11.104
- Come on!
- Come on!

01:35:13.984 --> 01:35:16.715
Would our new head of A&R care
to make a speech?

01:35:19.990 --> 01:35:21.390
- Alan.
- What?

01:35:21.391 --> 01:35:22.359
Alan.

01:35:24.094 --> 01:35:27.730
Alan, help! Alan...

01:35:27.731 --> 01:35:29.563
- She just fell.
- Christ!

01:35:30.267 --> 01:35:32.361
What kind of fucking...

01:35:41.011 --> 01:35:42.035
She's dead.

01:35:42.746 --> 01:35:44.578
Jesus. Jesus!

01:35:45.248 --> 01:35:46.580
Shit. Fuck.

01:35:47.250 --> 01:35:48.946
Fucking...

01:35:50.253 --> 01:35:53.052
Oh, God. What happened?

01:35:54.725 --> 01:35:55.920
I don't know, Alan!

01:35:59.262 --> 01:36:01.959
She fell off the bed on the bottle.

01:36:02.499 --> 01:36:03.592
She's dead!

01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:07.095
- Fucking God!
- Through the fucking neck, didn't it.

01:36:13.510 --> 01:36:14.705
I'm calling the police.

01:36:15.746 --> 01:36:17.237
I am the fucking police.

01:36:18.982 --> 01:36:20.075
We're out of our minds.

01:36:21.618 --> 01:36:24.816
There'll be forensic evidence
that we both, you know...

01:36:25.722 --> 01:36:26.917
Christ.

01:36:29.126 --> 01:36:31.095
You know what happens to coppers in prison?

01:36:35.732 --> 01:36:36.927
So what are we going to do?

01:36:38.869 --> 01:36:41.604
There's a level of grief you'll take
from doing your secretary.

01:36:41.605 --> 01:36:43.139
The red eyes, the balled Kleenexes,

01:36:43.140 --> 01:36:46.842
the substandard work and
the frosty silences in the office.

01:36:46.843 --> 01:36:48.812
And there's a level of grief
you definitely don't want.

01:36:49.513 --> 01:36:52.711
Like a copper on ketamine dismembering
a corpse in your fucking en suite.

01:36:56.720 --> 01:36:59.451
Still, secretaries come and go.

01:36:59.990 --> 01:37:01.857
Bands come and go.

01:37:01.858 --> 01:37:03.588
Even executives come and go.

01:37:04.127 --> 01:37:08.264
But record companies, we're here forever.

01:37:08.265 --> 01:37:10.366
Schneider, Waters,

01:37:10.367 --> 01:37:13.269
Parker Hall,
bloody Rebecca suddenly buggering off.

01:37:13.270 --> 01:37:14.829
We've had a very difficult year.

01:37:16.139 --> 01:37:17.573
But it's a tough business.

01:37:18.375 --> 01:37:19.343
You know what they say.

01:37:20.110 --> 01:37:22.244
A&R, artiste and repertoire,

01:37:22.245 --> 01:37:26.580
the branch of the music industry concerned
with finding and nurturing new talent.

01:37:27.250 --> 01:37:30.119
Since the first field hand
crawled out of a Mississippi swamp

01:37:30.120 --> 01:37:33.255
and croaked his miserable blues
into a wax cylinder,

01:37:33.256 --> 01:37:35.589
we've been here, taking our piece.

01:37:36.726 --> 01:37:39.560
The Beatles earned a penny
a record for most of their career.

01:37:40.363 --> 01:37:41.922
The fucking balls on us.

01:37:43.867 --> 01:37:45.096
