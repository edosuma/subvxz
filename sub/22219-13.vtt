00:11.845 --> 00:13.446

00:13.447 --> 00:16.181
<b>What if my team takes you all</b>
<b>the way down to your last two?</b>

00:16.183 --> 00:18.284
<b>- Then my last two people</b>
<b>will be in the finale.</b>

00:18.285 --> 00:20.419

00:20.420 --> 00:23.923
<b> <i>announcer: Alliances formed</b>

00:23.924 --> 00:25.358

00:25.359 --> 00:27.026
<b>than any of those dudes.</b>

00:27.027 --> 00:29.028
<b>-</b><b> <i>They pick one person</i> </b>
<b> <i>and go after them,</i> </b>

00:29.029 --> 00:30.296
<b>and they're plucking them off.</b>

00:30.297 --> 00:31.797
<b>- It's gonna be thrilling</b>

00:31.798 --> 00:33.766
<b>watching you do the skull pick.</b>

00:33.767 --> 00:35.168
<b>Vengeance will be had.</b>

00:36.403 --> 00:37.670
<b>you got to cut the head</b>
<b>off this [bleep].</b>

00:37.671 --> 00:39.238
<b>- It's done.</b>

00:39.239 --> 00:42.041
<b> <i>announcer: And the battle</b>
<b>of the sexes was on.</i> </b>

00:42.042 --> 00:43.943
<b>- The girls are</b>
<b>getting tighter every day.</b>

00:43.944 --> 00:45.778
<b>- I want to beat the [bleep]</b>
<b>out of these boys.</b>

00:45.779 --> 00:48.648
<b>- The winner of today's</b>
<b>flash challenge is Nikki.</b>

00:48.649 --> 00:49.815
<b>- Thank you.</b>

00:49.816 --> 00:51.717
<b>- Stop playing</b>
<b>the [bleep] vagina card.</b>

00:51.718 --> 00:54.520
<b>"It's so hard for a girl</b>
<b>to be a [bleep] tattoo artist."</b>

00:54.521 --> 00:56.189
<b>I'm over the [bleep] head games.</b>

00:56.190 --> 00:57.924
<b>I'm done with this [bleep] game.</b>

00:57.925 --> 01:00.092
<b>I'm walking</b>
<b>the [bleep] up out of here.</b>

01:00.093 --> 01:03.763
<b>I'm going out like a [bleep] G.</b>

01:03.764 --> 01:05.565
<b>- So close to the end, though.</b>

01:05.566 --> 01:08.301
<b>- I'm a little annoyed.</b>

01:08.302 --> 01:10.770
<b> <i>announcer: Now three artists</b>
<b>from each team</i> </b>

01:12.439 --> 01:14.807
<b> <i>ready to fight to the finish.</i> </b>

01:14.808 --> 01:17.176

01:17.177 --> 01:19.278
<b>- Half of us are going</b>
<b>for elimination next time.</b>

01:19.279 --> 01:22.348
<b>- And half of us right here</b>

01:22.349 --> 01:24.083

01:24.084 --> 01:25.518
<b>and everybody</b>
<b>wants to win this thing.</b>

01:25.519 --> 01:27.119
<b>- It's like playing</b>
<b>Russian Roulette.</b>

01:27.120 --> 01:28.487
<b>-</b><b> <i>We have to work together</i> </b>
<b> <i>as a team,</i> </b>

01:28.488 --> 01:31.157
<b>but in the end,</b>
<b>it's every man for himself.</b>

01:31.158 --> 01:34.193
<b>- I feel like it's time</b>
<b>for a female Ink Master.</b>

01:34.194 --> 01:38.097
<b>- My strongest competition</b>
<b>are also my closest allies.</b>

01:38.098 --> 01:41.767

04:14.488 --> 04:16.322
<b>- Accuracy is crucial.</b>

04:16.322 --> 04:20.059
<b>One misplaced brick can</b>
<b>distort your entire image.</b>

04:20.060 --> 04:23.896

<b>Nikki, you won</b>
<b>the last elimination tattoo,</b>

04:36.710 --> 04:38.611

04:38.612 --> 04:41.714
<b>This is the first time</b>
<b>you can pair any two artists</b>

04:41.715 --> 04:43.583
<b>regardless of the team.</b>

04:43.584 --> 04:46.219
<b>Look out for yourself,</b>
<b>and be strategic.</b>

04:46.220 --> 04:47.587

05:05.205 --> 05:07.673

05:07.674 --> 05:09.909
<b>This was one</b>
<b>of the smartest decisions</b>

05:09.910 --> 05:11.244
<b>Nikki has made.</b>

05:11.245 --> 05:13.045
<b> <i>If I win this thing with her,</i> </b>

<b>[bleep] is gonna be</b>
<b>a royal rumble.</b>

05:17.784 --> 05:19.052
<b>- Three.</b>

05:20.854 --> 05:22.688
<b>- One.</b>

05:22.689 --> 05:24.056
<b> <i>I don't trust Nikki,</i> </b>

05:24.057 --> 05:25.291

<b>I'm about to be</b>

05:30.797 --> 05:33.165

05:33.166 --> 05:35.468
<b>- Three.</b>

05:35.469 --> 05:37.069
<b>-</b><b> <i>Oh, Nikki.</i> </b>

05:37.070 --> 05:41.874
<b>If you had just put a girl</b>

05:41.875 --> 05:47.080
<b>you would be guaranteed a girl</b>

05:48.882 --> 05:50.783
<b>- Okay, those are the pairs.</b>

05:50.784 --> 05:52.185
<b>The winners</b>
<b>of the flash challenge</b>

05:52.186 --> 05:54.520
<b>will have the power to assign</b>
<b>all human canvases</b>

05:54.521 --> 05:56.122
<b>in the elimination tattoo.</b>

05:56.123 --> 05:59.192
<b>You have six hours</b>
<b>to show your accuracy</b>

05:59.193 --> 06:01.561
<b>by building</b>
<b>a massive brick wall.</b>

06:01.562 --> 06:04.830
<b>And your time begins...</b>

06:04.831 --> 06:05.831
<b>now.</b>

06:07.768 --> 06:08.768
<b>- All right, Nikki.</b>

06:08.769 --> 06:10.269
<b>- Man, what are your ideas?</b>

06:10.270 --> 06:14.607
<b>- This is not something that</b>
<b>any of these artists ever do.</b>

06:14.608 --> 06:17.443
<b>Stacking these bricks is gonna</b>
<b>be a tough test of accuracy.</b>

06:17.444 --> 06:20.780
<b>You basically have to create</b>
<b>a large pixilated item</b>

06:20.781 --> 06:22.481
<b> <i>out of different colored bricks.</i> </b>

06:22.482 --> 06:24.083
<b>- We need to fill</b>
<b>the entire thing.</b>

06:24.084 --> 06:25.852
<b>- I thought about a ship.</b>

06:25.853 --> 06:27.453
<b>-</b><b> <i>This is not only creating art,</i> </b>

06:27.454 --> 06:28.621
<b>but it's actually putting</b>

06:28.622 --> 06:32.225
<b>a level of manual labor</b>
<b>into the game.</b>

06:32.226 --> 06:33.659
<b>This is gonna be fun.</b>

06:33.660 --> 06:35.628
<b>- I was thinking, like, maybe,</b>
<b>like, a candle or something.</b>

06:35.629 --> 06:36.662
<b>- Oh, yeah.</b>

06:36.663 --> 06:37.830
<b>- If we do black</b>
<b>in the background.</b>

06:37.831 --> 06:39.532
<b>Yes!</b> <b>- Uh, uh!</b>

06:39.533 --> 06:40.967
<b>[laughter]</b>

06:40.968 --> 06:43.069
<b>- Okay, yes.</b>
<b>- Great.</b>

06:43.070 --> 06:44.337
<b>- What the hell</b>
<b>are we gonna do, dude?</b>

06:44.338 --> 06:46.138
<b>- We're not dealing</b>
<b>with organic shapes,</b>

06:46.139 --> 06:48.307
<b>and we can't make curves</b>
<b>that easily.</b>

06:48.308 --> 06:51.978
<b>- Honestly, maybe, like, a</b>
<b>really traditional large piece,</b>

06:51.979 --> 06:53.579
<b>like a sacred heart.</b>

06:53.580 --> 06:55.281
<b>- This could work.</b>
<b>- Okay.</b>

06:55.282 --> 06:57.250
<b>- A sacred heart</b>
<b>could be really cool.</b>

06:57.251 --> 07:00.253
<b>- Right, a simple two, two.</b>
<b>- Yep.</b>

07:00.254 --> 07:01.522
<b>- Four more hours.</b>

07:08.929 --> 07:11.731
<b>- Tap those out, and make them</b>
<b>continue that line.</b>

07:11.732 --> 07:14.033
<b>- If anybody needs a skull pick,</b>
<b>it's definitely me and Nate.</b>

07:14.034 --> 07:16.335
<b> <i>We've been the underdogs,</i> </b>
<b> <i>and I work hard.</i> </b>

07:16.336 --> 07:18.037
<b>It's not a black thing;</b>
<b>it's not a gay thing.</b>

07:18.038 --> 07:19.238
<b>- One blue, one white.</b>

07:19.239 --> 07:21.641
<b>-</b><b> <i>I do my best</i> </b>
<b> <i>to present good work,</i> </b>

07:21.642 --> 07:25.111
<b> <i>regardless of what I had</i> </b>
<b> <i>to overcome to get here.</i> </b>

07:25.112 --> 07:27.547
<b>Getting hot out here.</b>

07:27.548 --> 07:30.783
<b>- How does Nate manage to sit</b>
<b>for every challenge?</b>

07:30.784 --> 07:32.919
<b>- Three hours to go, guys.</b>
<b>Three hours.</b>

07:32.920 --> 07:34.788
<b>- I am getting bruises all over.</b>

07:39.193 --> 07:41.194
<b>- Uh-oh, what are they doing?</b>

07:41.195 --> 07:44.063
<b>Look at what those</b>
<b>little bastards are doing.</b>

07:44.064 --> 07:47.600
<b>- Oh...</b>

07:47.601 --> 07:48.835
<b>Damn it.</b>

07:48.836 --> 07:50.770
<b>- <i>Of all the images in the world,</i> </b>

07:50.771 --> 07:52.839
<b>we're both doing sacred hearts?</b>

07:52.840 --> 07:54.707
<b>And that's the team</b>
<b>I did not want to win.</b>

07:54.708 --> 07:58.477
<b>- Well, it's good for me</b>
<b>if they win, so...</b>

07:58.478 --> 08:00.012
<b>- The only thing I'm counting on</b>

08:00.013 --> 08:04.016
<b>is that their green thorns look</b>
<b>all [bleep] up and weird.</b>

08:04.017 --> 08:06.586
<b>Now it's just gonna be,</b>
<b>"Who's sacred heart is better?"</b>

08:06.587 --> 08:08.821
<b>I knew I should have spread</b>
<b>all of us bitches apart.</b>

08:08.822 --> 08:11.724
<b>- Oh, no, you done [bleep] up.</b>

08:11.725 --> 08:13.025
<b>- Who knows?</b>

08:13.026 --> 08:16.162
<b>Maybe the girls will do</b>
<b>better than both of us.</b>

08:16.163 --> 08:19.232
<b>What the [bleep]</b>
<b>are they making?</b>

08:19.233 --> 08:20.666
<b>- Look at me.</b>

08:20.667 --> 08:24.136
<b> <i>Do I look</i> </b>
<b> <i>like the type of person</i> </b>

08:24.137 --> 08:28.241
<b> <i>that excels at manual labor?</i> </b>

08:28.242 --> 08:31.911
<b>My hands are tender and doughy.</b>

08:31.912 --> 08:33.279
<b>Do you ever just fail</b>
<b>at something,</b>

08:33.280 --> 08:34.480
<b>and you're like, "This is fine"?</b>

08:34.481 --> 08:36.215
<b>- I think I just got [bleep] on.</b>

08:36.216 --> 08:39.352
<b>I definitely just</b>
<b>got [bleep] on.</b>

08:39.352 --> 08:42.922
<b>- Five, four, three...</b>

08:42.923 --> 08:45.057
<b>two, one.</b>

08:45.058 --> 08:46.726
<b>That is it, time is up.</b>

08:46.727 --> 08:48.895
<b>Bricks down, no more masonry.</b>

08:48.896 --> 08:50.162
<b>- Damn.</b>

08:50.163 --> 08:51.831
<b>- [bleep] busted our asses</b>
<b>with that one.</b>

08:51.832 --> 08:52.832
<b>- Yeah, we did.</b>

08:52.833 --> 08:53.833
<b>- [groans] [bleep].</b>

08:53.834 --> 08:55.334
<b>- Nate and Kevin.</b>

08:55.335 --> 08:58.070
<b> <i>Of course I underestimated them.</i> </b>

08:58.071 --> 08:59.372
<b>- Too bad they copied us.</b>

08:59.373 --> 09:01.440
<b>-</b><b> <i>If Nate and Kevin</i> </b>
<b> <i>get the skull pick,</i> </b>

09:01.441 --> 09:03.142

<b> <i>Me and Gian need to win this.</i> </b>

09:07.748 --> 09:11.050
<b>- All right, Kelly and Ryan,</b>
<b>what was your idea here?</b>

09:11.051 --> 09:12.552
<b>- It's a candle.</b>

09:12.553 --> 09:15.021
<b>- As far as recognition of,</b>
<b>"Boom, that is a candle,"</b>

09:15.022 --> 09:16.722
<b>it's kind of a blank.</b>

09:16.723 --> 09:19.258
<b>-</b><b> <i>Definitely looked</i> </b>

09:19.259 --> 09:21.427
<b>- Honestly, ladies, once you've</b>
<b>come up with a creative design,</b>

09:21.428 --> 09:22.728
<b>then</b><b> <i>it's just strict by number.</i> </b>

09:22.729 --> 09:24.030
<b> <i>Could have come up</i> </b>
<b> <i>with something</i> </b>

09:24.031 --> 09:25.898
<b>a lot more interesting</b>
<b>and a lot more dynamic.</b>

09:25.899 --> 09:27.099
<b>You fall pretty short.</b>

09:27.100 --> 09:29.235
<b>- We failed all over the place.</b>

09:29.236 --> 09:31.470
<b> <i>Nikki and Gian have to win</i> </b>

09:31.471 --> 09:34.841
<b>to ensure that the girls</b>
<b>get a skull pick.</b>

09:34.842 --> 09:36.676
<b>- Nikki and Gian.</b>

09:36.677 --> 09:39.579
<b>- The accuracy on this shows</b>
<b>in the recognizability.</b>

09:39.580 --> 09:42.081
<b> <i>From a mile away, you can tell</i> </b>
<b> <i>exactly what it is.</i> </b>

09:42.082 --> 09:43.583
<b> <i>You can read</i> </b>
<b> <i>what the lettering is.</i> </b>

09:43.584 --> 09:45.451
<b> <i>I like the fact that you used</i> </b>
<b> <i>the natural brick</i> </b>

09:45.452 --> 09:47.220
<b> <i>to break up your actual color,</i> </b>

09:47.221 --> 09:49.088
<b>so it wasn't so rainbow bright.</b>

09:49.089 --> 09:50.356
<b>- The white</b>
<b>in the center of the flame</b>

09:50.357 --> 09:51.891
<b>gives it that little</b>
<b>three-dimensional shape.</b>

09:51.892 --> 09:54.060
<b>You could have done some of that</b>
<b>with all the black outline.</b>

09:54.061 --> 09:56.229
<b>Would have been</b>
<b>a cool touch too.</b>

09:56.230 --> 09:57.663
<b>- Nate and Kevin.</b>

09:57.664 --> 09:59.999
<b> <i>- You are the only team</i> </b>
<b> <i>that used all six colors.</i> </b>

10:00.000 --> 10:02.034
<b> <i>The recessed and pushed-out</i> </b>
<b> <i>bricks for the thorns</i> </b>

10:02.035 --> 10:04.604
<b>really look cool, definitely</b>
<b>gives it something extra.</b>

10:04.605 --> 10:06.272
<b>- Accuracy,</b>
<b>you hit it out of the park.</b>

10:06.273 --> 10:09.008
<b> <i>You have matching areas</i> </b>
<b> <i>all the way throughout.</i> </b>

10:09.009 --> 10:10.510
<b> <i>Everything is symmetrical.</i> </b>

10:10.511 --> 10:12.879
<b> <i>I love the highlights in</i> </b>
<b> <i>the heart, shape of the flame,</i> </b>

10:12.880 --> 10:15.214
<b> <i>and most of all,</i> </b>
<b> <i>I like the rays emanating out.</i> </b>

10:15.215 --> 10:17.116
<b> <i>That took a lot</i> </b>
<b> <i>of careful consideration</i> </b>

10:17.117 --> 10:18.985
<b>and a lot of careful planning,</b>
<b>accuracy.</b>

10:18.986 --> 10:20.119
<b>You did a great job.</b>

10:20.120 --> 10:21.587
<b> <i>- Your heart</i> </b>
<b> <i>against their heart,</i> </b>

10:21.588 --> 10:23.289
<b> <i>Nate and Kevin's is the one</i> </b>
<b> <i>that stands out strong.</i> </b>

10:23.290 --> 10:25.191
<b>- Do we even need</b>
<b>to go deliberate?</b>

10:25.192 --> 10:26.425
<b>- No.</b>

10:26.426 --> 10:27.793
<b>- We have a pretty</b>
<b>clear-cut winner today.</b>

10:27.794 --> 10:28.794
<b>- Yeah.</b>

10:28.795 --> 10:30.162
<b>- We have never not had</b>

10:30.163 --> 10:31.964
<b>a deliberation</b>
<b>for a flash challenge.</b>

10:31.965 --> 10:34.000
<b>I don't think it's ever</b>
<b>been this clear-cut.</b>

10:34.001 --> 10:35.334
<b>The judges have decided</b>

10:35.335 --> 10:37.503
<b>the winners</b>
<b>of today's flash challenge</b>

10:37.504 --> 10:38.938
<b>are Kevin and Nate.</b>

10:38.939 --> 10:41.507
<b>- This is the best</b>
<b>possible scenario.</b>

10:41.508 --> 10:43.976
<b> <i>I'm sick and tired of getting</i> </b>
<b> <i>the bad skull picks.</i> </b>

10:43.977 --> 10:46.479
<b>We are definitely hitting</b>
<b>the girls and hitting them hard.</b>

10:46.480 --> 10:48.781
<b>- In this competition right now,</b>
<b>as tight as it is,</b>

10:48.782 --> 10:50.783
<b>three people guaranteed</b>
<b>to go to the finale,</b>

10:50.784 --> 10:52.585
<b>if you want to be</b>
<b>one of the top three,</b>

10:52.586 --> 10:54.453
<b>somebody's gonna have</b>
<b>to fight for this,</b>

10:54.454 --> 10:57.290
<b>'cause the people that</b>
<b>don't fight are going home.</b>

10:57.291 --> 10:59.058
<b>- Kevin and Nate,</b>
<b>you have the power</b>

10:59.059 --> 11:01.494
<b>to assign all human canvases</b>

11:01.495 --> 11:03.963
<b>for the elimination tattoo</b>
<b>together.</b>

11:03.964 --> 11:06.432
<b>- I am so shocked that</b>
<b>that lazy mother [bleep]</b>

11:06.433 --> 11:08.067
<b>is winning this challenge.</b>

11:08.068 --> 11:11.871
<b>How did he do this while he</b>
<b>was sitting on his ass?</b>

11:11.872 --> 11:13.072
<b>I'm dead.</b>

11:13.073 --> 11:14.875
<b>- You can all head back</b>
<b>to the loft.</b>

11:18.178 --> 11:19.278
<b>- Hit the key players.</b>

11:19.279 --> 11:21.113
<b>- Nikki needs to be taken out.</b>

11:21.114 --> 11:24.116
<b>If they're not me or you,</b>
<b>everybody's getting [bleep].</b>

11:24.117 --> 11:26.352
<b>-</b><b> <i>I'm the only one</i> </b>
<b> <i>that doesn't do portraits.</i> </b>

11:26.353 --> 11:27.855
<b>I'm [bleep].</b>

11:29.330 --> 11:32.332
<b> <i>[rock music]</i> </b>

11:32.333 --> 11:33.933
<b> <i>♪</i> </b>

11:33.934 --> 11:36.236
<b>- Everybody thought</b>
<b>we were gonna drop the ball.</b>

11:36.237 --> 11:37.670
<b>- That was the sweetest victory.</b>

11:37.671 --> 11:39.072
<b>It couldn't have come</b>
<b>at a better time.</b>

11:39.073 --> 11:40.974
<b>- Now is the time</b>
<b>for us to be in charge</b>

11:40.975 --> 11:42.508
<b>and hit the key players,</b>

11:42.509 --> 11:45.345
<b>because this might be our only</b>
<b>shot at changing the game.</b>

11:45.346 --> 11:46.913
<b>- If I can [bleep]</b>
<b>everybody in this house,</b>

11:46.914 --> 11:48.581
<b>everybody in this house</b>
<b>will get [bleep].</b>

11:48.582 --> 11:50.016
<b>- But no matter what,</b>

11:50.017 --> 11:52.318
<b>it's got to be</b>
<b>one of the girls that go down.</b>

11:52.319 --> 11:53.686
<b>- Nikki needs to be taken out.</b>

11:53.687 --> 11:56.522
<b>Nikki has come for me</b>
<b>so many times, and you.</b>

11:56.523 --> 11:58.524
<b>- I mean, Nikki's</b>
<b>at the top of the list.</b>

11:58.525 --> 11:59.859
<b>But I think we should keep it</b>

11:59.860 --> 12:01.861
<b>a little bit on the cool</b>
<b>with Gian.</b>

12:01.862 --> 12:03.696
<b>- Why try to save anybody,</b>
<b>you know what I mean?</b>

12:03.697 --> 12:04.964
<b>- True.</b>

12:04.965 --> 12:06.065
<b>- At this point,</b>
<b>with six of us in the house,</b>

12:06.066 --> 12:07.066
<b>everybody's open game.</b>

12:07.067 --> 12:08.067
<b>- Yeah.</b>

12:08.068 --> 12:09.168
<b>- If they're not me or you,</b>

12:09.169 --> 12:13.006
<b>everybody's getting [bleep].</b>

12:13.007 --> 12:14.241
<b>Everybody.</b>

12:28.222 --> 12:29.322
<b>- Welcome.</b>

12:29.323 --> 12:31.057
<b>Half of you will go home</b>
<b>empty-handed,</b>

12:31.058 --> 12:34.994
<b>but half of you will earn</b>
<b>a spot in the live finale</b>

12:34.995 --> 12:37.664
<b>and a shot at $100,000,</b>

12:37.665 --> 12:42.202
<b>a feature in "Inked" magazine,</b>
<b>and the title of Ink Master.</b>

12:42.203 --> 12:43.903
<b>- And also on the line,</b>

12:43.904 --> 12:45.605
<b>a guest spot at Chris' shop,</b>

12:45.606 --> 12:47.740
<b>Hand Crafted</b>
<b>in Fort Lauderdale, Florida,</b>

12:47.741 --> 12:50.176
<b>or Oliver's shop,</b>
<b>Elm Street Tattoo</b>

12:50.177 --> 12:52.245
<b>in Dallas, Texas.</b>

12:52.246 --> 12:55.848
<b>And today we have</b>
<b>a very special guest judge.</b>

12:55.849 --> 12:58.618
<b>Tattooing for over 20 years,</b>

12:58.619 --> 13:03.122
<b>he's the owner of Classic Tattoo</b>
<b>and Saltwater Tattoo Supply,</b>

13:03.123 --> 13:05.092
<b>Mr. Tim Hendrix.</b>

13:09.630 --> 13:12.632
<b>- Tim Hendrix</b>
<b>is a tattoo superstar.</b>

13:12.633 --> 13:16.469
<b>It is intimidating</b>
<b>having him in the same room,</b>

13:16.470 --> 13:18.137
<b>let alone judging us.</b>

13:18.138 --> 13:20.673
<b>- How are you guys?</b>

13:20.674 --> 13:22.342
<b>I've been tattooing 25 years.</b>

13:22.343 --> 13:23.776
<b>I started when I was 15.</b>

13:23.777 --> 13:25.511
<b> <i>I like to think</i> </b>
<b> <i>that I'm the kind of tattooer</i> </b>

13:25.512 --> 13:26.980
<b> <i>that can do any style.</i> </b>

13:26.981 --> 13:29.949
<b>To be an Ink Master, you have</b>
<b>to be good at everything.</b>

13:29.950 --> 13:32.419
<b>You can't just specialize</b>
<b>in one thing.</b>

13:34.021 --> 13:35.588
<b>- For this elimination tattoo,</b>

13:35.589 --> 13:39.292
<b>you must tattoo</b>
<b>the ultimate test of accuracy:</b>

13:39.293 --> 13:41.227
<b>A portrait.</b>

13:41.228 --> 13:42.228
<b>- [bleep].</b>

13:42.229 --> 13:44.797
<b>Portraits, my Achilles tendon.</b>

13:44.798 --> 13:45.899
<b>I'm [bleep].</b>

13:45.900 --> 13:47.166
<b>- Sweet.</b>

13:47.167 --> 13:49.636
<b> <i>Hell yeah, portrait day,</i> </b>
<b> <i>that is my day.</i> </b>

13:49.637 --> 13:51.170
<b>I don't see anybody</b>
<b>in this house</b>

13:51.171 --> 13:52.672
<b>beating me</b>
<b>on a portrait challenge.</b>

13:52.673 --> 13:57.344
<b>- And today your canvases</b>
<b>want portraits of toddlers.</b>

13:59.280 --> 14:01.447
<b>- Toddler portraits</b>
<b>are so much more difficult</b>

14:01.448 --> 14:02.849
<b>than normal portraits,</b>

14:02.850 --> 14:05.885
<b>because the proportions</b>
<b>have to be very round and soft.</b>

14:05.886 --> 14:07.687
<b>Otherwise, you can age the image</b>

14:07.688 --> 14:09.856
<b>and make it look</b>
<b>like somebody that it's not.</b>

14:09.857 --> 14:11.324
<b>- But that's not all.</b>

14:11.325 --> 14:15.595
<b>You'll be tattooing head-to-head</b>
<b>with another artist,</b>

14:15.596 --> 14:19.499
<b>because two canvases</b>
<b>want each portrait.</b>

14:19.500 --> 14:21.134
<b>- What?</b>

14:21.135 --> 14:22.468
<b>- And that means your work</b>

14:22.469 --> 14:24.971
<b>will be compared</b>
<b>directly with another artist,</b>

14:24.972 --> 14:28.241
<b>and any error will be apparent.</b>

14:28.242 --> 14:32.412
<b>- Tattooing the same portrait</b>
<b>against another artist,</b>

14:32.413 --> 14:36.482
<b>there's nowhere to hide</b>
<b>any discrepancies.</b>

14:36.483 --> 14:38.151
<b>This is by far the hardest thing</b>

14:38.152 --> 14:39.686
<b>we have had to do yet.</b>

14:39.687 --> 14:40.987
<b>- Head-to-head competitions,</b>

14:40.988 --> 14:43.489
<b>it's a true</b>
<b>apples-to-apples comparison.</b>

14:43.490 --> 14:44.857
<b>Down to this final six,</b>

14:44.858 --> 14:46.960
<b>where anybody</b>
<b>could really go home,</b>

14:46.961 --> 14:48.761
<b>this is gonna be a real battle.</b>

14:48.762 --> 14:50.096
<b>It could be any man's game.</b>

14:50.097 --> 14:51.231
<b>- [bleep].</b>

14:51.232 --> 14:52.533
<b>- Let's meet your canvases.</b>

14:57.037 --> 14:59.873
<b>Nate and Kevin,</b>
<b>you won he flash challenge.</b>

14:59.874 --> 15:01.541
<b>That means that</b>
<b>you have the power</b>

15:01.542 --> 15:03.276
<b>to assign the canvases.</b>

15:03.277 --> 15:05.211
<b>That also means</b>
<b>that you will determine</b>

15:05.212 --> 15:08.581
<b>which artists</b>
<b>are tattooing head-to-head.</b>

15:08.582 --> 15:12.018
<b>So be strategic.</b>

15:12.019 --> 15:14.520
<b>-</b><b> <i>Kevin is the perfect person</i> </b>
<b> <i>to share the skull pick with.</i> </b>

15:14.521 --> 15:16.189
<b> <i>I don't think</i> </b>
<b> <i>teams matter anymore.</i> </b>

15:16.190 --> 15:17.891
<b>We're both on board</b>
<b>for knocking out</b>

15:17.892 --> 15:19.325
<b>the people that need</b>
<b>to be knocked out.</b>

15:19.326 --> 15:20.526
<b>- I'm a portrait artist.</b>

15:20.527 --> 15:21.895
<b>That's what I do</b>
<b>day in and day out.</b>

15:21.896 --> 15:23.563
<b> <i>If there's a bad canvas</i> </b>
<b> <i>for all of them,</i> </b>

15:23.564 --> 15:24.797
<b>then so be it.</b>

15:24.798 --> 15:26.266
<b>- I want it to be more focused</b>
<b>on his face.</b>

15:26.267 --> 15:27.667
<b>I really want the dimples</b>
<b>to shine.</b>

15:27.668 --> 15:28.968
<b>Black and gray, please.</b>

15:28.969 --> 15:30.036
<b>- I want color.</b>

15:30.037 --> 15:31.404
<b>- Are you set on color?</b>

15:31.405 --> 15:32.872
<b>- I'm kind of picky.</b>

15:32.873 --> 15:34.440
<b>- I do not want this canvas.</b>

15:34.441 --> 15:36.109
<b> <i>I think it's</i> </b>
<b> <i>a washed-out picture.</i> </b>

15:36.110 --> 15:38.077
<b> <i>there's no detail</i> </b>
<b> <i>to go off from.</i> </b>

15:38.078 --> 15:39.946
<b>It's gonna be</b>
<b>really hard to use.</b>

15:39.947 --> 15:43.116
<b>- I want a black-and-gray</b>
<b>realistic photo on my back.</b>

15:43.117 --> 15:45.685
<b>- I would like a black-and-gray</b>
<b>portrait of him on my chest.</b>

15:45.686 --> 15:47.053
<b>- How many tattoos do you have?</b>

15:47.054 --> 15:48.154
<b>- Not one.</b>

15:48.155 --> 15:49.222
<b>- [gasps]</b>

15:49.223 --> 15:50.423
<b>It's this guy's first tattoo.</b>

15:50.424 --> 15:51.658
<b>- Oh...</b>

15:51.659 --> 15:54.327
<b>I definitely do not want</b>
<b>that chest piece.</b>

15:54.328 --> 15:56.229
<b>They hurt a lot.</b>

15:56.230 --> 15:57.230
<b>- Where you looking</b>
<b>to get it at?</b>

15:57.231 --> 15:58.231
<b>- On my upper arm.</b>

15:58.232 --> 15:59.599
<b>Photo-realistic color.</b>

15:59.600 --> 16:01.668
<b>- I'm also going</b>
<b>with photo-realistic color</b>

16:01.669 --> 16:03.137
<b>on my back.</b>

16:05.339 --> 16:07.073
<b>If this is the canvas I get,</b>

16:07.074 --> 16:08.675
<b>I could really be screwed.</b>

16:08.676 --> 16:10.143
<b>- What are you thinking?</b>

16:10.144 --> 16:12.045
<b>- Put two people up</b>
<b>that are really good</b>

16:12.046 --> 16:13.781
<b>against each other</b>
<b>so one of them goes down.</b>

16:15.349 --> 16:17.151
<b>- Who do you want</b>
<b>to go up against?</b>

16:19.253 --> 16:20.753
<b>- And I'm definitely</b>
<b>doing color today.</b>

16:20.754 --> 16:22.590
<b>- Okay.</b>
<b>- Let's do it.</b>

16:24.992 --> 16:26.727
<b>- First tattoo.</b>
<b>- First time.</b>

16:29.496 --> 16:31.130
<b>- Okay, canvases, one by one,</b>

16:31.131 --> 16:34.000
<b>please read the artist's name</b>
<b>on the bottom of your skull.</b>

16:34.001 --> 16:35.903
<b>- Kelly.</b>
<b>- [laughs]</b>

16:40.174 --> 16:41.175
<b>- Nikki.</b>

16:51.018 --> 16:52.419
<b>- Nate.</b>

16:56.423 --> 16:57.625
<b>- Gian.</b>

17:00.928 --> 17:02.795
<b>- Kevin.</b>

17:02.796 --> 17:03.997
<b>- Ryan.</b>

17:03.998 --> 17:04.998
<b>-</b><b> <i>I'm sweating</i> </b>

17:04.999 --> 17:07.200
<b>because I can't do color realism</b>

17:07.201 --> 17:08.736
<b> <i>on a toddler portrait.</i> </b>

17:10.905 --> 17:12.472
<b>- You will have six hours</b>

17:12.473 --> 17:14.674
<b>to tattoo a portrait</b>
<b>of a toddler.</b>

17:14.675 --> 17:16.209
<b>Based on your work,</b>

17:16.210 --> 17:18.645
<b>one of you will close shop.</b>

17:18.646 --> 17:21.214
<b>Good luck.</b>

<b>- When you're doing</b>
<b>a portrait of a specific person,</b>

17:23.717 --> 17:25.718
<b> <i>accuracy is everything.</i> </b>

17:25.719 --> 17:27.921
<b> <i>If the details aren't there,</i> </b>
<b> <i>it's the wrong person.</i> </b>

17:27.922 --> 17:29.255
<b> <i>Now the teams</i> </b>
<b> <i>are three and three.</i> </b>

17:29.256 --> 17:30.857
<b>That means three people</b>
<b>are going to the finale,</b>

17:30.858 --> 17:32.492
<b>and three people are going home.</b>

17:32.493 --> 17:33.726
<b>- I'm gonna reference</b>
<b>from this picture.</b>

17:33.727 --> 17:35.995
<b>- I feel pretty safe</b>
<b>that Team Peck</b>

17:35.996 --> 17:38.398
<b>is gonna have representation</b>
<b>in the finale.</b>

17:38.399 --> 17:40.667
<b>- I think his little</b>
<b>plaid shirt is adorable,</b>

17:40.668 --> 17:42.268
<b>and I would</b>
<b>definitely include that.</b>

17:42.269 --> 17:45.438
<b>If I can convince this canvas</b>
<b>to switch to black and gray,</b>

17:45.439 --> 17:48.408
<b>I can flip this entire thing</b>
<b>around on Kevin.</b>

17:48.409 --> 17:49.542
<b>I am a portrait artist.</b>

17:49.543 --> 17:50.944
<b>I do portraits regularly.</b>

17:50.945 --> 17:51.945
<b>- That's wonderful.</b>
<b>- Yeah.</b>

17:51.946 --> 17:52.946
<b>- That's such good news.</b>

17:52.947 --> 17:54.581
<b>Great.</b>

17:54.582 --> 17:56.983
<b>- But I do black-and-gray</b>
<b>portraits.</b>

17:56.984 --> 17:59.552
<b>- I see that you do</b>
<b>add some color.</b>

17:59.553 --> 18:01.754
<b>So that's an option maybe?</b>

18:01.755 --> 18:04.524
<b>- Color tattoos don't age</b>
<b>as well as black-and-gray.</b>

18:04.525 --> 18:07.560
<b>- Well, it looks like you</b>
<b>can still make the eyes bright,</b>

18:07.561 --> 18:08.561
<b>which is what I want.</b> <b>- Yeah.</b>

18:08.562 --> 18:09.762
<b>- And I wanted bright eyes,</b>

18:09.763 --> 18:11.231
<b>and you can do that</b>
<b>with black and gray?</b>

18:11.232 --> 18:12.699
<b>- Oh, absolutely.</b>

18:12.700 --> 18:15.535
<b> <i>If I'm doing black and gray</i> </b>
<b> <i>on portrait day,</i> </b>

18:15.536 --> 18:17.604
<b>kiss your ass good-bye, Kevin.</b>

18:17.605 --> 18:20.039
<b>- So I know you want it</b>
<b>in the chest.</b>

18:20.040 --> 18:21.274
<b>This is your first tattoo,</b>
<b>right?</b>

18:21.275 --> 18:22.275
<b>- Yeah.</b>

18:22.276 --> 18:23.576
<b>- But I think we should</b>

18:23.577 --> 18:25.011
<b>change that spot, man.</b>

18:25.012 --> 18:26.479
<b>I'm super nervous right now.</b>

18:26.480 --> 18:29.215
<b>Everybody here does portraits</b>
<b>every other day.</b>

18:29.216 --> 18:30.917
<b> <i>I don't do portraits that often.</i> </b>

18:30.918 --> 18:32.919
<b>Got this dip here, you know,</b>

18:32.920 --> 18:36.256
<b>and then we're gonna</b>
<b>have to go so small around it.</b>

18:36.257 --> 18:37.257
<b>- Yeah, right.</b>

18:37.258 --> 18:39.192
<b>- Man, I would recommend...</b>

18:39.193 --> 18:42.929
<b>I know the chest is cool</b>
<b>to have, like, portraits on it.</b>

18:42.930 --> 18:44.597
<b>But, man,</b>
<b>I would really recommend</b>

18:44.598 --> 18:45.599
<b>we do it somewhere else.</b>

18:47.768 --> 18:49.235
<b>- My canvas</b>
<b>is giving me a hard time</b>

18:49.236 --> 18:50.570
<b>on switching the portrait.</b>

18:50.571 --> 18:52.138
<b>What are the chances</b>
<b>I can convince you</b>

18:52.139 --> 18:54.274
<b>to do this on the thigh?</b>

18:54.275 --> 18:55.441
<b>- No?</b>

18:55.442 --> 18:57.210
<b> <i>This is a do-or-die</i> </b>
<b> <i>moment for me.</i> </b>

18:57.211 --> 18:58.444
<b>I mean, I really do think</b>

18:58.445 --> 19:00.414

19:10.921 --> 19:12.488
<b>I haven't done many, like,</b>
<b>color faces, but...</b>

19:12.489 --> 19:13.990

19:13.991 --> 19:16.459
<b>- Yeah, I don't want to</b>
<b>a black-and-gray portrait</b>

19:16.460 --> 19:18.394
<b>right next to Kelly's</b>
<b>black-and-gray portrait.</b>

19:18.395 --> 19:20.496

19:20.497 --> 19:22.398
<b>She has a totally</b>
<b>different style.</b>

19:22.399 --> 19:23.466
<b>- Yeah, you're right.</b>

19:23.467 --> 19:24.667
<b>- If I was gonna get</b>
<b>tattooed by you,</b>

<b>- All right, well,</b>
<b>I'd rather listen to you guys.</b>

19:30.340 --> 19:32.141
<b>After hearing that...</b>

19:32.142 --> 19:33.542
<b>- What do you think?</b>

19:33.543 --> 19:35.945
<b>- I think I want to give</b>

19:35.946 --> 19:36.946
<b>You know?</b>

19:36.947 --> 19:37.947

19:37.948 --> 19:39.515
<b>- Really?</b>
<b>- Yeah.</b>

19:39.516 --> 19:41.450
<b>Just win.</b>

<b>- What's going on?</b>
<b>- How you doing, bud?</b>

19:43.020 --> 19:44.020
<b>- So what are you thinking?</b>

19:44.021 --> 19:45.488
<b>Obviously full color, huh?</b>

19:45.489 --> 19:46.722
<b>- Yeah, for sure.</b>

19:46.723 --> 19:48.858
<b>- I'm just not</b>

19:55.432 --> 19:56.666
<b> <i>I'm done giving it to him.</i> </b>

<b>- Good luck, guys.</b>
<b>- Thanks.</b>

20:00.604 --> 20:02.939

<b>you have six hours</b>

20:02.940 --> 20:06.776
<b>to tattoo an accurate portrait</b>
<b>of a toddler.</b>

20:06.777 --> 20:09.845
<b>And your time starts...</b>

20:09.846 --> 20:11.280
<b>now.</b>

20:11.281 --> 20:12.815
<b>- Let's do this.</b>

20:12.816 --> 20:14.116
<b>- Just sit there</b>
<b>on the edge here.</b>

20:14.117 --> 20:16.852
<b>- Let's get this stencil on.</b>
<b>- Okay.</b>

20:16.853 --> 20:18.621
<b>- This is a great test</b>
<b>of accuracy,</b>

20:18.622 --> 20:20.323
<b>because you have</b>
<b>different fabrics</b>

20:20.324 --> 20:22.458
<b> <i>expressions, hairstyles,</i> </b>
<b> <i>you have hats.</i> </b>

20:22.459 --> 20:24.694
<b> <i>Any little difference</i> </b>
<b> <i>from the photo</i> </b>

20:24.695 --> 20:28.531
<b>can change these portraits</b>
<b>into somebody else fast.</b>

20:28.532 --> 20:31.867
<b>- I wanted to make sure, like,</b>
<b>A, it fits the area.</b>

20:31.868 --> 20:34.837
<b>Plus, this way, I get to</b>
<b>get all that detail in his eyes.</b>

20:34.838 --> 20:37.673
<b>- Right now, I think that</b>
<b>I still am in a pretty good seat</b>

20:37.674 --> 20:39.342
<b> <i>with my top three players.</i> </b>

20:39.343 --> 20:42.012
<b>And that still leaves me</b>
<b>in a good position to battle on.</b>

20:45.916 --> 20:48.551
<b>- Stencil doesn't look</b>
<b>that good, does it?</b>

20:48.552 --> 20:50.820
<b>I'm the only one that doesn't</b>
<b>do [bleep] portraits.</b>

20:52.489 --> 20:55.258
<b> <i>I have way too much detail</i> </b>
<b> <i>in it.</i> </b>

20:55.259 --> 20:56.759
<b>I'm just gonna scratch</b>
<b>the whole thing.</b>

20:56.760 --> 20:58.728
<b> <i>I'm gonna start over again.</i> </b>

20:58.729 --> 21:01.665
<b>[tattoo machine buzzing]</b>

21:07.738 --> 21:09.438
<b>- Yeah, that's kind of weird.</b>

21:09.439 --> 21:11.274
<b>Gian's freaking out right now.</b>

21:11.275 --> 21:13.643
<b> <i>This is the best</i> </b>
<b> <i>possible scenario for me.</i> </b>

21:13.644 --> 21:16.078
<b> <i>I do portraits all the time.</i> </b>

21:16.079 --> 21:17.647
<b>I don't see anybody</b>
<b>in this house</b>

21:17.648 --> 21:20.216
<b>beating me</b>
<b>on a portrait challenge.</b>

21:20.217 --> 21:21.217
<b>- [moans slightly]</b>

21:24.488 --> 21:25.488
<b>- Yeah.</b>

21:27.291 --> 21:28.457
<b> <i>I took a big risk,</i> </b>

21:28.458 --> 21:29.759
<b>playing my strategy</b>
<b>the way I did,</b>

<b> <i>staying in that middle ground.</i> </b>

21:31.595 --> 21:33.195
<b> <i>Now that things are heating up,</i> </b>

21:33.196 --> 21:35.665
<b>I need to step it up</b>
<b>and start winning.</b>

21:35.666 --> 21:37.266
<b>- Artists, you have</b>
<b>five hours left.</b>

21:37.267 --> 21:38.602
<b>Five hours remaining.</b>

21:41.805 --> 21:43.706
<b>- I decided to go</b>
<b>up against Ryan</b>

21:43.707 --> 21:45.708
<b>because I've never</b>
<b>seen her do anything</b>

21:45.709 --> 21:47.343
<b> <i>color-realism before.</i> </b>

21:47.344 --> 21:49.312
<b> <i>But, of course,</i> </b>
<b> <i>she convinced her canvas</i> </b>

21:49.313 --> 21:51.681
<b> <i>to do black and gray.</i> </b>

21:51.682 --> 21:53.716
<b> <i>I do portraits all day,</i> </b>
<b> <i>so I'm confident enough</i> </b>

21:53.717 --> 21:56.052
<b> <i>to go against anybody</i> </b>
<b> <i>in this challenge.</i> </b>

21:56.053 --> 21:57.820
<b>So we're the only ones</b>
<b>doing color.</b>

21:57.821 --> 21:59.855
<b>- No one else is?</b>
<b>- She was the only one.</b>

21:59.856 --> 22:01.657
<b>- Judges can say</b>
<b>everyone took easy street,</b>

22:01.658 --> 22:04.026
<b>black and gray.</b>

22:04.027 --> 22:05.895
<b>- They're not gonna say that.</b>
<b>- No?</b>

22:05.896 --> 22:09.565
<b>- I know the judges</b>
<b>hate color portraits.</b>

22:09.566 --> 22:12.435
<b>I'm gonna do it anyway.</b>

22:12.436 --> 22:13.870
<b>- Three hours to go, guys.</b>

22:17.908 --> 22:19.575
<b>- Everyone in this competition</b>

22:19.576 --> 22:22.578
<b>knows that</b>
<b>I'm a new-school artist.</b>

22:22.579 --> 22:25.114
<b> <i>But what I tried to make sure</i> </b>
<b> <i>they didn't know</i> </b>

22:25.115 --> 22:26.949
<b>is that I'm also</b>
<b>an award-winning</b>

22:26.950 --> 22:29.253
<b>black-and-gray portrait artist.</b>

22:30.954 --> 22:34.123

22:34.124 --> 22:36.859
<b>Ours are definitely</b>
<b>done completely different.</b>

22:36.860 --> 22:38.494
<b>Definitely.</b>

22:38.495 --> 22:41.898
<b>-</b><b> <i>Kevin and Nate want to see me</i> </b>
<b> <i>and Nikki go head-to-head,</i> </b>

22:41.899 --> 22:43.232
<b>because they're afraid.</b>

22:43.233 --> 22:46.335
<b>And this might be</b>
<b>their only opportunity</b>

22:46.336 --> 22:47.638
<b> <i>to get one over on the girls.</i> </b>

22:50.774 --> 22:52.475
<b>-</b><b> <i>Kelly's an amazing artist,</i> </b>

22:52.476 --> 22:55.244
<b>and I don't want her to come out</b>
<b>on top against me.</b>

22:55.245 --> 22:58.514
<b> <i>The pressure is on right now.</i> </b>

22:58.515 --> 23:00.850
<b>- Yeah, you went for it.</b>

23:00.851 --> 23:02.285
<b>- Well...</b>
<b>- Good.</b>

23:02.286 --> 23:04.420
<b>- If I did something</b>
<b>that you guys didn't want</b>

23:04.421 --> 23:05.421
<b>and then did badly,</b>

23:05.422 --> 23:06.689
<b>I'd just feel like an idiot.</b>

23:06.690 --> 23:08.424
<b>[chuckles]</b>

23:08.425 --> 23:10.026
<b>- This is your final hour.</b>

23:10.027 --> 23:12.094
<b>One hour left.</b>

23:12.095 --> 23:13.195
<b>- What do you think?</b>

23:13.196 --> 23:15.197
<b>- Everybody's going real slow.</b>

23:15.198 --> 23:17.767
<b>I mean, Gian has basically</b>
<b>just started.</b>

23:17.768 --> 23:19.135
<b>- Well, he re-drew his stencil.</b>

23:19.136 --> 23:20.136
<b>- And how long did that take?</b>

23:20.137 --> 23:21.304
<b>- Yeah, it's been a while.</b>

23:21.305 --> 23:23.472
<b>- That's crazy, right?</b>

23:23.473 --> 23:25.007
<b>I think Nate's gonna be able</b>
<b>to do a portrait,</b>

23:25.008 --> 23:26.809
<b>but I don't think it's gonna</b>
<b>be as strong.</b>

23:26.810 --> 23:27.944
<b>- As much of a punch.</b>

23:27.945 --> 23:29.345
<b>- Yeah, like, he can't compete</b>

23:29.346 --> 23:31.447
<b>with what Nikki's got going on.</b>

23:31.448 --> 23:32.848
<b>Nobody has that black</b>
<b>like Nikki has.</b>

23:32.849 --> 23:34.450
<b>- Yeah, like Nikki.</b>

23:34.451 --> 23:35.885
<b>That's my horse.</b>

23:35.886 --> 23:37.353
<b>- Yeah, I would bet</b>
<b>on that horse.</b>

23:37.354 --> 23:38.955
<b>- If you got one person</b>
<b>trying to get in the finale</b>

23:38.956 --> 23:41.257
<b>for Team Nuñez, that's the one.</b>

23:41.258 --> 23:43.359
<b>- This still feels</b>
<b>like neck-and-neck right now,</b>

23:43.360 --> 23:45.027
<b>with... as far as teams, you know?</b>

23:45.028 --> 23:46.629
<b>- There was a time</b>
<b>that Team Nuñez</b>

23:46.630 --> 23:48.464
<b>seemed to have a little bit</b>
<b>of the upper hand...</b>

23:48.465 --> 23:49.465
<b>- Hey, hey...</b>

23:49.466 --> 23:51.133
<b>- But not now.</b>

23:51.134 --> 23:53.069
<b>I've been proactive</b>
<b>with my team,</b>

23:53.070 --> 23:54.270
<b>and I think it's paid off.</b>

23:54.271 --> 23:56.172
<b>- Yeah.</b>
<b>- Hey, that's not nice.</b>

23:56.173 --> 23:57.640
<b>- I'm predicting at least</b>

23:57.641 --> 23:59.475
<b>two members of Team Peck</b>
<b>in the finale.</b>

23:59.476 --> 24:00.743
<b>- Yeah?</b>
<b>- Yeah.</b>

24:00.744 --> 24:03.512
<b>- Yeah, but who's</b>
<b>gonna do the guest spot?</b>

24:03.513 --> 24:04.513
<b>[laughter]</b>

24:04.514 --> 24:06.816
<b>- 15 minutes, guys.</b>

24:06.817 --> 24:08.751
<b>- Oh, my...</b>

24:08.752 --> 24:10.520
<b>- God damn.</b>

24:13.056 --> 24:17.260
<b>- My tattoo is not looking</b>
<b>exactly as I had planned.</b>

24:17.261 --> 24:19.462
<b> <i>Because that photo was so light,</i> </b>

24:19.463 --> 24:20.796
<b> <i>I have to put shading in there</i> </b>

24:20.797 --> 24:23.065
<b>that's not necessarily</b>
<b>in the photo.</b>

24:23.066 --> 24:24.433
<b> <i>I know it's solid,</i> </b>

24:24.434 --> 24:26.736
<b>but it may not be as accurate</b>
<b>as it could be.</b>

24:26.737 --> 24:29.805
<b>- Five, four, three...</b>

24:29.806 --> 24:31.908
<b>two, one.</b>

24:31.909 --> 24:34.076
<b>That's it, time's up,</b>
<b>machines down.</b>

24:34.077 --> 24:35.811
<b>No more ink.</b>

24:35.812 --> 24:37.513
<b>- Oh, my God, that's gorgeous.</b>

24:37.514 --> 24:39.482
<b>You got everything.</b> <b>- Yeah.</b>

24:39.483 --> 24:40.483
<b>- It's perfect.</b>

24:40.484 --> 24:41.751
<b>- Yeah, it's pretty sick.</b>

24:41.752 --> 24:43.119
<b>Good job.</b>

24:43.120 --> 24:46.022
<b>- Kevin's tattoo looks</b>
<b>kind of like an old man,</b>

24:46.023 --> 24:48.457
<b> <i>with weird striped taffy candy</i> </b>

24:48.458 --> 24:50.226
<b> <i>laid on his head like a wig.</i> </b>

24:50.227 --> 24:52.628
<b> <i>I can confidently say</i> </b>

24:52.629 --> 24:55.465
<b>my portrait is way more accurate</b>
<b>than Kevin's.</b>

24:57.701 --> 24:59.535
<b>- You do miss</b>
<b>some key points in this.</b>

24:59.536 --> 25:00.670
<b>- Calm down.</b>

25:00.671 --> 25:01.938
<b>- You calm down;</b>
<b>are you kidding me?</b>

25:01.939 --> 25:03.105
<b>- Every time</b>
<b>y'all get a critique,</b>

25:03.106 --> 25:04.507
<b>oh, the world's ending.</b>

25:04.508 --> 25:06.242
<b>- Bull[bleep],</b>
<b>you're not picking favorites.</b>

25:06.243 --> 25:07.643
<b>- You can't be mad</b>
<b>at this [bleep].</b>

25:07.644 --> 25:09.012
<b>- Come on, Gian.</b>

25:11.507 --> 25:14.509
<b> <i>[rock music]</i> </b>

25:14.510 --> 25:16.711
<b> <i>♪</i> </b>

25:16.712 --> 25:18.513
<b>- What tattoo would you rather</b>
<b>have on your body,</b>

25:18.514 --> 25:19.848
<b>Nikki's or Kevin's?</b>

25:19.849 --> 25:22.751
<b>- For me, Kevin's tattoo</b>
<b>does look like the kid.</b>

25:22.752 --> 25:24.052
<b>-</b><b> <i>Kevin's tattoo makes that kid</i> </b>

25:24.053 --> 25:26.388
<b>look like he's,</b>
<b>like, a weird old man.</b>

25:26.389 --> 25:29.190
<b>- Nikki's looks one step away</b>
<b>from being a zombie portrait.</b>

25:29.191 --> 25:30.725
<b>-</b><b> <i>The hair is [bleep] jacked.</i> </b>

25:30.726 --> 25:32.060
<b> <i>It's too dark.</i> </b>

25:32.061 --> 25:33.995
<b> <i>The [bleep] T-shirt</i> </b>
<b> <i>looks like [bleep].</i> </b>

25:33.996 --> 25:36.898
<b>That tattoo doesn't look</b>
<b>at all like the kid,</b>

25:36.899 --> 25:38.700
<b>not even a little bit.</b>

25:38.701 --> 25:40.869
<b>And if it goes down to accuracy,</b>

25:40.870 --> 25:42.838
<b>Nikki should go home</b>
<b>for that tattoo.</b>

25:57.787 --> 26:01.423
<b>- Today we were testing accuracy</b>
<b>with toddler portraits.</b>

26:01.424 --> 26:03.258
<b>Each of you went head-to-head</b>

26:03.259 --> 26:05.894
<b>with another artist</b>
<b>on the same portrait.</b>

26:05.895 --> 26:07.262
<b>Let's see how you did.</b>

26:07.263 --> 26:08.397
<b>Nikki.</b>

26:10.666 --> 26:12.867
<b>You tattooed the same portrait</b>
<b>as Kelly.</b>

26:12.868 --> 26:14.903
<b>- I can see</b>
<b>the resemblance of the kid,</b>

26:14.904 --> 26:17.072
<b> <i>but I think the likeness</i> </b>
<b> <i>is a little bit off.</i> </b>

26:17.073 --> 26:19.307
<b>-</b><b> <i>That face is really,</i> </b>
<b> <i>really, really washed out,</i> </b>

26:19.308 --> 26:21.910
<b>and I knew I'd have</b>
<b>to kick up the contrast a lot,</b>

26:21.911 --> 26:25.080
<b>and that could really sway away</b>
<b>from the likeness of the kid.</b>

26:25.081 --> 26:26.981
<b>- You missed a lot</b>
<b>of light tones.</b>

26:26.982 --> 26:30.251
<b> <i>And it's extremely bright</i> </b>
<b> <i>right below his eyebrow.</i> </b>

26:30.252 --> 26:31.619
<b> <i>It's so contrasted.</i> </b>

26:31.620 --> 26:33.722
<b>- To me, the area</b>
<b>where this thing strays</b>

26:33.723 --> 26:35.423
<b> <i>is how bright</i> </b>
<b> <i>the eyes and lips are.</i> </b>

26:35.424 --> 26:36.858
<b> <i>The sparkle over-does it.</i> </b>

26:36.859 --> 26:38.993
<b> <i>You put that highlight</i> </b>
<b> <i>in the top of the lip,</i> </b>

26:38.994 --> 26:40.395
<b> <i>it gives it a lipstick feel.</i> </b>

26:40.396 --> 26:42.464
<b>- I really think that this looks</b>

26:42.465 --> 26:45.400
<b>little Little Miss Teen Toddler.</b>

26:45.401 --> 26:47.469
<b> <i>Put a wig on it,</i> </b>
<b> <i>put it in a little tutu,</i> </b>

26:47.470 --> 26:48.871
<b>she's done up for the pageant.</b>

26:52.074 --> 26:55.310
<b>- Kelly, you tattooed</b>
<b>the same portrait as Nikki.</b>

26:55.311 --> 26:58.346
<b>- Kelly does capture</b>
<b>the likeness of the child,</b>

26:58.347 --> 27:00.515
<b>which actually</b>
<b>kind of surprises me,</b>

27:00.516 --> 27:01.850
<b>because you changed a lot.</b>

27:01.851 --> 27:03.985
<b> <i>You did give the chin</i> </b>
<b> <i>definition.</i> </b>

27:03.986 --> 27:05.120
<b> <i>You closed the mouth.</i> </b>

27:05.121 --> 27:06.621
<b>There's no teeth.</b>

27:06.622 --> 27:08.957
<b>You also went a little too dark</b>
<b>right here with the dimples.</b>

27:08.958 --> 27:11.192
<b> <i>It just pinches that mouth</i> </b>
<b> <i>really tight in there.</i> </b>

27:11.193 --> 27:12.260
<b>- Why did you change it?</b>

27:12.261 --> 27:13.561
<b>- Honestly, I didn't want it</b>

27:13.562 --> 27:15.997
<b>to look like he had</b>
<b>a snaggletooth.</b>

27:15.998 --> 27:18.266
<b>-</b><b> <i>But he does have</i> </b>
<b> <i>a snaggletooth in the photo.</i> </b>

27:18.267 --> 27:19.734
<b>Even though you took</b>
<b>some liberties,</b>

27:19.735 --> 27:21.436
<b>you captured that baby face.</b>

27:21.437 --> 27:22.737
<b> <i>The left side of the face,</i> </b>

27:22.738 --> 27:24.673
<b> <i>you let the sun</i> </b>
<b> <i>hit that side of the hair.</i> </b>

27:24.674 --> 27:26.842
<b>The subtle little touches</b>
<b>really work.</b>

27:29.912 --> 27:31.346
<b>- So who gets the win?</b>

27:31.347 --> 27:33.848
<b>- Nikki's missed it on</b>
<b>the likeness in a lot of areas.</b>

27:33.849 --> 27:35.884
<b> <i>The accuracy</i> </b>
<b> <i>is a little bit off.</i> </b>

27:35.885 --> 27:37.585
<b>Kelly, on all fronts, gets it.</b>

27:37.586 --> 27:38.720
<b>- I would say Kelly.</b>

27:38.721 --> 27:39.788
<b>- Kelly gets it.</b>

27:39.789 --> 27:41.022
<b>- The judges have decided.</b>

27:41.023 --> 27:43.158
<b>The winner of this head-to-head</b>
<b>is Kelly.</b>

27:43.159 --> 27:45.226
<b>- Thank you.</b>
<b>- Damn it.</b>

27:45.227 --> 27:46.461
<b>- Nate.</b>

27:46.462 --> 27:48.797
<b>You tattooed</b>
<b>the same portrait as Gian.</b>

27:48.798 --> 27:50.965
<b>- Nate, you captured</b>
<b>the likeness.</b>

27:50.966 --> 27:52.267
<b>I like the way that you captured</b>

27:52.268 --> 27:54.002
<b>the little indention</b>
<b>on the top of the nose,</b>

27:54.003 --> 27:56.004
<b> <i>and the really subtle</i> </b>
<b> <i>highlights in the eyes</i> </b>

27:56.005 --> 27:57.772
<b> <i>and that little glimmer</i> </b>
<b> <i>is perfect.</i> </b>

27:57.773 --> 28:00.275
<b>- I love the way you put a line</b>
<b>right on his hand.</b>

28:00.276 --> 28:01.676
<b> <i>Normally a lot of people</i> </b>
<b> <i>won't do that,</i> </b>

28:01.677 --> 28:02.811
<b> <i>and it gets washed out.</i> </b>

28:02.812 --> 28:04.379
<b>Accuracy, it hits the mark.</b>

28:04.380 --> 28:07.015
<b>- Thank you.</b>

28:07.016 --> 28:08.717
<b>- Gian.</b>

28:08.718 --> 28:10.819
<b>You tattooed</b>
<b>the same portrait as Nate.</b>

28:10.820 --> 28:12.587
<b>- Overall, man,</b>
<b>you definitely captured</b>

28:12.588 --> 28:14.089
<b>the likeness of the kid.</b>

28:14.090 --> 28:17.659
<b> <i>You have some very nice powdery</i> </b>
<b> <i>grays throughout the face</i> </b>

28:17.660 --> 28:19.227
<b> <i>that really let</i> </b>
<b> <i>the natural shape</i> </b>

28:19.228 --> 28:20.795
<b> <i>of the contour come alive.</i> </b>

28:20.796 --> 28:23.598
<b>- But I find a lack of accuracy</b>
<b>in a lot of places.</b>

28:23.599 --> 28:25.767
<b> <i>You simplified the ear</i> </b>
<b> <i>immensely.</i> </b>

28:25.768 --> 28:27.569
<b> <i>You didn't come in</i> </b>
<b> <i>and line the teeth.</i> </b>

28:27.570 --> 28:29.971
<b>And on a day where accuracy</b>
<b>is pinpointed,</b>

28:29.972 --> 28:31.440
<b>you do miss</b>
<b>some key points in this.</b>

28:33.576 --> 28:36.144
<b>- Who took it down</b>
<b>between Gian and Nate?</b>

28:36.145 --> 28:37.846
<b>- Nate hedges Gian out,</b>
<b>in my book.</b>

28:37.847 --> 28:41.049
<b>-</b><b> <i>The shading on the child's</i> </b>
<b> <i>right side under the hat,</i> </b>

28:41.050 --> 28:42.584
<b> <i>that darkness on Gian's</i> </b>

28:42.585 --> 28:45.487
<b> <i>creates a shape of the head</i> </b>
<b> <i>that doesn't exist.</i> </b>

28:45.488 --> 28:46.955
<b>-</b><b> <i>Yeah.</i> </b>

28:46.956 --> 28:49.057
<b>-</b><b> <i>Nate got the shape</i> </b>
<b> <i>of the child's head perfectly.</i> </b>

28:49.058 --> 28:50.291
<b>- Unanimously, it's Nate.</b>

28:50.292 --> 28:51.593
<b>- Judges have decided.</b>

28:51.594 --> 28:53.595
<b>The winner of this head-to-head</b>
<b>battle is Nate.</b>

28:53.596 --> 28:55.197
<b>- Congratulations, man.</b>
<b>- Thank you.</b>

28:57.600 --> 29:02.604
<b>- Kevin, you tattooed</b>
<b>the same portrait as Ryan.</b>

29:02.605 --> 29:04.606
<b>-</b><b> <i>This was the hardest one</i> </b>
<b> <i>of the portraits to do.</i> </b>

29:04.607 --> 29:05.840
<b>-</b><b> <i>I wouldn't have chose</i> </b>
<b> <i>this photo.</i> </b>

29:05.841 --> 29:07.308
<b> <i>It's not an easy one.</i> </b>

29:07.309 --> 29:09.377
<b>- Color portraits is a thing</b>
<b>that I honestly enjoy, so...</b>

29:09.378 --> 29:10.745
<b>- The colors that you picked</b>

29:10.746 --> 29:12.914
<b>are very much the color</b>
<b>of your canvas' skin.</b>

29:12.915 --> 29:15.250
<b> <i>So when this thing does heal</i> </b>
<b> <i>and washes out,</i> </b>

29:15.251 --> 29:17.118
<b> <i>you're gonna have</i> </b>
<b> <i>really strong eyes,</i> </b>

29:17.119 --> 29:18.586
<b> <i>a strong bottom of a nose,</i> </b>

29:18.587 --> 29:20.121
<b> <i>and some really heavy</i> </b>
<b> <i>blue lines.</i> </b>

29:20.122 --> 29:23.058
<b>The color play in this</b>
<b>is what really throws it.</b>

29:23.059 --> 29:24.993
<b>- I don't think you did</b>
<b>a correct representation</b>

29:24.994 --> 29:26.461
<b>of the hair in the photo.</b>

29:26.462 --> 29:27.829
<b> <i>You have this slick part,</i> </b>

29:27.830 --> 29:29.831
<b> <i>and then he has these hairs</i> </b>
<b> <i>that are flowing over.</i> </b>

29:29.832 --> 29:31.433
<b> <i>You don't have</i> </b>
<b> <i>any inference of that.</i> </b>

29:31.434 --> 29:33.301
<b> <i>And then you have</i> </b>
<b> <i>these slick loops</i> </b>

29:33.302 --> 29:35.036
<b> <i>that look like pudding swirl.</i> </b>

29:35.037 --> 29:37.006
<b>This doesn't look</b>
<b>like hair at all.</b>

29:39.108 --> 29:42.811
<b>- Ryan, you tattooed</b>
<b>the same portrait as Kevin.</b>

29:42.812 --> 29:45.013
<b>- It's a very slick,</b>
<b>smooth tattoo.</b>

29:45.014 --> 29:46.848
<b> <i>A lot of great</i> </b>
<b> <i>technical ability in there.</i> </b>

29:46.849 --> 29:49.050
<b> <i>The detail work in the shirt</i> </b>
<b> <i>is very nice,</i> </b>

29:49.051 --> 29:50.652
<b> <i>but where accuracy</i> </b>
<b> <i>really counted</i> </b>

29:50.653 --> 29:52.454
<b>was in the eyes</b>
<b>and that upper lip.</b>

29:52.455 --> 29:55.256
<b>The darkness under the eyes</b>
<b>got a little bit too dark,</b>

29:55.257 --> 29:58.393
<b> <i>and you dramatized the little</i> </b>
<b> <i>peak in his lip too much.</i> </b>

29:58.394 --> 30:00.628
<b>- The hair looks</b>
<b>a little bit animated,</b>

30:00.629 --> 30:01.963
<b> <i>like a comic book.</i> </b>

30:01.964 --> 30:04.432
<b>It just takes a little bit</b>
<b>of the life out of it.</b>

30:04.433 --> 30:06.201
<b>-</b><b> <i>The other thing that gets me</i> </b>
<b> <i>is that the right eye</i> </b>

30:06.202 --> 30:08.870
<b> <i>has more of a "V" to it</i> </b>
<b> <i>in your portrait</i> </b>

30:08.871 --> 30:10.538
<b> <i>than a soft, subtle roll.</i> </b>

30:10.539 --> 30:12.774
<b>Those are soft little details</b>
<b>that you missed,</b>

30:12.775 --> 30:17.545
<b>but on accuracy day, those</b>
<b>are the things to point out.</b>

30:17.546 --> 30:19.848
<b>- In terms of accuracy,</b>
<b>there are areas</b>

30:19.849 --> 30:22.183
<b>where both of them</b>
<b>really succeeded</b>

30:22.184 --> 30:24.552
<b> <i>and areas</i> </b>
<b> <i>where they both lost it.</i> </b>

30:24.553 --> 30:26.087
<b>-</b><b> <i>I think Ryan's hair</i> </b>
<b> <i>is more accurate.</i> </b>

30:26.088 --> 30:27.956
<b> <i>I think Ryan's shirt</i> </b>
<b> <i>is more accurate.</i> </b>

30:27.957 --> 30:30.392
<b>-</b><b> <i>I think Kevin's face</i> </b>
<b> <i>is more accurate overall.</i> </b>

30:30.393 --> 30:32.327
<b>- These two</b>
<b>are definitely challenged,</b>

30:32.328 --> 30:35.296
<b>and that's making it hard</b>
<b>to even come up with a winner.</b>

30:35.297 --> 30:37.565
<b>-</b><b> <i>I think Ryan's is nicer</i> </b>
<b> <i>as a tattoo.</i> </b>

30:37.566 --> 30:39.667
<b>And technically,</b>
<b>it's a lot smoother.</b>

30:39.668 --> 30:42.137
<b>- Me, personally, I'd rather</b>
<b>wear Ryan's tattoo.</b>

30:42.138 --> 30:44.172
<b>- My vote's for Ryan.</b>
<b>- Ryan.</b>

30:44.173 --> 30:46.608
<b>- All right, winner of this</b>
<b>head-to-head challenge is Ryan.</b>

30:46.609 --> 30:49.711
<b>Congratulations.</b>

30:49.712 --> 30:50.712
<b>You okay, Ryan?</b>

30:50.713 --> 30:51.946
<b>What are you thinking?</b>

30:51.947 --> 30:53.581
<b>- I just feel like</b>
<b>that was kind of brutal.</b>

30:53.582 --> 30:57.018
<b>Nate and Gian didn't get such</b>
<b>a brutal critique on theirs.</b>

30:57.019 --> 30:59.287
<b>I can look at Nate's tattoo</b>
<b>or Gian's tattoo</b>

30:59.288 --> 31:01.289
<b>and pick apart</b>
<b>a bunch of little things</b>

31:01.290 --> 31:02.824
<b>that were really inaccurate.</b>

31:02.825 --> 31:06.027
<b>- There were so many more areas</b>
<b>of your guys' portrait</b>

31:06.028 --> 31:07.195
<b>to be nitpicked.</b>

31:07.196 --> 31:08.196
<b>- What's just frustrating is...</b>

31:08.197 --> 31:09.464
<b>- What's frustrating is</b>

31:09.465 --> 31:12.233
<b>you've had nothing</b>
<b>but good critiques</b>

31:12.234 --> 31:13.868
<b>throughout a lot</b>
<b>of this competition,</b>

31:13.869 --> 31:15.837
<b>and you've had plenty</b>
<b>of mistakes too.</b>

31:15.838 --> 31:17.339
<b>But now that you're</b>
<b>getting critiqued,</b>

31:17.340 --> 31:18.707
<b>now you know how it feels.</b>

31:18.708 --> 31:21.643
<b>You or Nikki, every time</b>
<b>y'all get a critique,</b>

31:21.644 --> 31:22.977
<b>oh, the world's ending.</b>

31:22.978 --> 31:24.612
<b>- Oh, my God, Nate,</b>
<b>I'm not saying that.</b>

31:24.613 --> 31:25.814
<b>- You know, like, get over it.</b>

31:25.815 --> 31:27.048
<b>- I'm saying I think</b>
<b>that you guys</b>

31:27.049 --> 31:28.583
<b>got a really awesome critique,</b>

31:28.584 --> 31:29.651
<b>and that you didn't deserve</b>

31:29.652 --> 31:31.119
<b>all of this smoke</b>
<b>blown up your ass.</b>

31:31.120 --> 31:32.554
<b>- Okay.</b>

31:32.555 --> 31:34.423
<b>- I didn't think your tattoos</b>
<b>were that good.</b>

31:38.294 --> 31:39.728
<b>- All right, guys,</b>
<b>time to determine</b>

31:39.729 --> 31:42.097
<b>who had the best tattoo</b>
<b>of the day.</b>

31:42.098 --> 31:43.131
<b>- I'm leaning towards Kelly.</b>

31:43.132 --> 31:44.232
<b>- I'm leaning towards Nate</b>

31:44.233 --> 31:45.834
<b>in terms of just</b>
<b>looking like the kid.</b>

31:45.835 --> 31:47.769
<b>-</b><b> <i>It's got to be</i> </b>
<b> <i>between Nate and Kelly.</i> </b>

31:47.770 --> 31:49.237
<b>- Kelly's, I don't think so.</b>

31:49.238 --> 31:51.439
<b>If you guys are going</b>
<b>for accuracy,</b>

31:51.440 --> 31:53.274
<b>Nate's looks like the picture.</b>

31:53.275 --> 31:54.275
<b>- Fair is fair.</b>

31:54.276 --> 31:55.810
<b>Sheer accuracy,</b>

31:55.811 --> 31:57.212
<b> <i>Kelly, you changed the mouth,</i> </b>

31:57.213 --> 31:58.880
<b>so, all things considered, Nate.</b>

31:58.881 --> 32:00.382
<b>- Tim, final decision.</b>

32:00.383 --> 32:02.117
<b>- On sheer accuracy, Nate.</b>

32:02.118 --> 32:03.351
<b>- Oliver.</b>
<b>- Nate.</b>

32:03.352 --> 32:04.619
<b>- My vote is for Nate.</b>

32:04.620 --> 32:06.021
<b>The judges have decided</b>

32:06.022 --> 32:09.991
<b>that the best tattoo</b>
<b>of the day goes to Nate.</b>

32:09.992 --> 32:10.993
<b>- Thank you.</b>

32:13.696 --> 32:14.996
<b>- As the jury of peers,</b>

32:14.997 --> 32:16.798
<b>all of you must deliberate</b>

32:16.799 --> 32:19.034
<b>to put one artist</b>
<b>up for elimination.</b>

32:19.035 --> 32:20.869
<b>So choose wisely.</b>

32:20.870 --> 32:22.905
<b>Head back to the loft.</b>

32:27.276 --> 32:28.977
<b>- Oh, man.</b>

32:28.978 --> 32:31.312
<b>- That [bleep] critique</b>
<b>was bull[bleep].</b>

32:31.313 --> 32:33.048
<b>- Ryan and Kevin</b>
<b>got the harshest critique.</b>

32:33.049 --> 32:34.549
<b>We can agree on that.</b>

32:34.550 --> 32:36.551
<b>- [bleep] that,</b>
<b>they [bleep] rode me.</b>

32:36.552 --> 32:38.153
<b>They said my tattoo had...</b>

32:38.154 --> 32:40.422
<b>- Gian, they did not ride you,</b>
<b>I assure you.</b>

32:40.423 --> 32:41.923
<b>- What?</b>
<b>- No, they did not.</b>

32:41.924 --> 32:44.959
<b>You and Nate</b>
<b>got the easiest critiques.</b>

32:44.960 --> 32:46.795
<b>- The judges went easier</b>
<b>on Kelly and Nikki.</b>

32:46.796 --> 32:48.096
<b>- Did you not see how much</b>

32:48.097 --> 32:50.231
<b>they tore apart</b>
<b>each of our tattoos?</b>

32:50.232 --> 32:51.700
<b>- Not really, man.</b>

32:51.701 --> 32:53.568
<b>I mean, they could have... if...</b>

32:53.569 --> 32:54.803
<b>- Come on, Gian.</b>

32:54.804 --> 32:56.004
<b>- If I would have done...</b>

32:56.005 --> 32:57.939
<b>- This is baby's</b>
<b>first harsh critique,</b>

32:57.940 --> 32:58.940
<b>and now you're bummed about it.</b>

32:58.941 --> 33:00.275
<b>- It is.</b>

33:00.276 --> 33:02.110
<b>You've been getting it</b>
<b>real [bleep] easy.</b>

33:02.111 --> 33:03.645
<b>- Then why... how do I...</b>
<b>- And you think it's unfair.</b>

33:03.646 --> 33:05.413
<b>- Guess what,</b>
<b>we all [bleep] feel that way</b>

33:05.414 --> 33:07.048
<b>every time we get reamed.</b>

33:07.049 --> 33:08.383
<b>- Chris goes up there</b>
<b>and tells me,</b>

33:08.384 --> 33:10.885
<b>"Oh, your tattoo</b>
<b>has accuracy problems,"</b>

33:10.886 --> 33:12.787
<b>which I think is bull[bleep].</b>

33:12.788 --> 33:14.623
<b>- You're acting</b>
<b>like a toddler right now.</b>

33:18.538 --> 33:22.174
<b> <i>[dramatic music]</i> </b>

33:22.175 --> 33:23.209
<b>- We're the jury of peers,</b>

33:23.210 --> 33:24.243
<b>and we're here to find out</b>

33:24.244 --> 33:26.045
<b>who's going down</b>
<b>for elimination.</b>

33:26.046 --> 33:28.347
<b>- Well, let me talk</b>
<b>a little bit about accuracy.</b>

33:28.348 --> 33:29.548
<b>In Kevin's tattoo,</b>

33:29.549 --> 33:32.351
<b>the nose is too harsh</b>
<b>and too angled.</b>

33:32.352 --> 33:33.753
<b> <i>The eye on the right is droopy.</i> </b>

33:33.754 --> 33:35.755
<b> <i>The hair on top looks</i> </b>
<b> <i>like it has stripes in it.</i> </b>

33:35.756 --> 33:37.256
<b> <i>Neither of the stripes</i> </b>
<b> <i>are the color</i> </b>

33:37.257 --> 33:38.858
<b> <i>of the little boy's actual hair.</i> </b>

33:38.859 --> 33:40.393
<b>So... next.</b>

33:40.394 --> 33:42.461
<b>- My thing is, when you just</b>
<b>generally look at the picture</b>

33:42.462 --> 33:44.797
<b> <i>next to the reference,</i> </b>
<b> <i>it looks like that boy.</i> </b>

33:44.798 --> 33:46.599
<b>In all honesty, please.</b>

33:46.600 --> 33:48.334
<b>- My vote is for Nikki,</b>

33:48.335 --> 33:49.902
<b> <i>because I'm going</i> </b>
<b> <i>for the accuracy.</i> </b>

33:49.903 --> 33:52.405
<b>- Oh, Jesus [bleep] Christ,</b>
<b>really?</b>

33:52.406 --> 33:53.706
<b>- Why are you mad about that?</b>

33:53.707 --> 33:55.141
<b>- I mean, you can't be mad</b>
<b>at this [bleep].</b>

33:55.142 --> 33:56.308
<b>I'm not mad when...</b>

33:56.309 --> 33:57.643
<b>- I can roll my [bleep] eyes</b>

33:57.644 --> 33:59.445
<b>if I want to roll</b>
<b>my [bleep] eyes.</b>

33:59.446 --> 34:02.114
<b>- You didn't hit the challenge</b>
<b>as hard as mine.</b>

34:02.115 --> 34:04.784
<b>- Kevin, your nose is gonna</b>
<b>be gone in two weeks.</b>

34:04.785 --> 34:06.852
<b>- And yours is forever not</b>
<b>gonna look like that little boy,</b>

34:06.853 --> 34:08.954
<b> <i>forever.</i> </b> <b> <i>- That's... that's true.</i> </b>

34:08.955 --> 34:10.755
<b>I'm not trying</b>
<b>to pick favorites here.</b>

34:10.757 --> 34:12.824
<b>- Bull[bleep] you're not</b>
<b>picking favorites</b>

34:12.826 --> 34:13.826
<b>right now, Gian.</b>

34:13.827 --> 34:14.827
<b>- I'm not.</b>

34:14.828 --> 34:15.995
<b>- We don't have a team.</b>

34:15.996 --> 34:16.996
<b>Who do you got?</b>

34:16.996 --> 34:18.330
<b>- I'm voting for Kevin.</b>

34:18.331 --> 34:19.632
<b>- Really, that's what</b>
<b>you really think?</b>

34:19.632 --> 34:20.966
<b>I thought this was all unbiased.</b>

34:20.967 --> 34:23.569
<b>- Never, ever question</b>
<b>my integrity again, Nate.</b>

34:23.570 --> 34:25.103
<b>- You're gonna say that</b>
<b>that looks like that kid?</b>

34:25.105 --> 34:26.772
<b>-</b><b> <i>It doesn't look like that kid,</i> </b>

34:26.773 --> 34:29.574
<b>but I don't think that Kevin's</b>
<b>looks like that kid either.</b>

34:29.576 --> 34:32.812
<b>Now I have to go</b>
<b>to artistic and technical,</b>

34:32.813 --> 34:35.014
<b>and that's where Nikki</b>
<b>is edging out</b>

34:35.014 --> 34:36.482
<b>in front of Kevin for me.</b>

34:36.483 --> 34:37.817
<b>And it's based entirely</b>

34:37.818 --> 34:39.918
<b>on the merits of each tattoo.</b>

34:39.920 --> 34:43.822
<b>It has nothing to do</b>
<b>with anything personal.</b>

34:43.824 --> 34:45.991
<b>- So today</b>
<b>we're judging accuracy</b>

34:45.992 --> 34:47.860
<b>with portraits of toddlers.</b>

34:47.860 --> 34:49.628
<b>- I thought they were</b>
<b>all good tattoos.</b>

34:49.629 --> 34:52.732
<b>But it's the tiny little things</b>
<b>in portraits</b>

34:52.733 --> 34:55.368
<b>that separate good tattoos</b>
<b>from great tattoos.</b>

34:55.369 --> 34:56.869
<b>- So who's in the bottom today?</b>

34:56.870 --> 34:58.637
<b>I mean, we're gonna have</b>
<b>to bring three people down.</b>

34:58.638 --> 35:01.040
<b>-</b><b> <i>Kevin's hair and shirt,</i> </b>
<b> <i>that's one in the bottom.</i> </b>

35:01.041 --> 35:03.142
<b>-</b><b> <i>Nowhere does it</i> </b>
<b> <i>really look like hair.</i> </b>

35:03.143 --> 35:04.744
<b>- It looks like a statue.</b>
<b>- Right.</b>

35:04.745 --> 35:06.746
<b>- And Ryan, that is not the kid.</b>

35:06.747 --> 35:08.147
<b>-</b><b> <i>That hair is made up.</i> </b>

35:08.148 --> 35:10.516
<b>-</b><b> <i>And so is the nose,</i> </b>
<b> <i>so is that right eye.</i> </b>

35:10.517 --> 35:12.685
<b>- I do not have a problem</b>
<b>bringing Ryan to the bottom,</b>

35:12.686 --> 35:15.021
<b>and I do not have a problem</b>
<b>bringing Nikki to the bottom.</b>

35:15.022 --> 35:16.789
<b>-</b><b> <i>The eyes have been changed.</i> </b>

35:16.790 --> 35:18.891
<b> <i>The mouth is totally inaccurate.</i> </b>

35:18.892 --> 35:21.160
<b>-</b><b> <i>She just highlighted</i> </b>
<b> <i>the wrong [bleep].</i> </b>

35:21.161 --> 35:22.161
<b>- I don't know, man.</b>

35:22.162 --> 35:23.295
<b>Look at the chin.</b>

35:23.296 --> 35:25.431
<b> <i>That's a chin of a male model.</i> </b>

35:25.432 --> 35:26.966
<b>- This is an interesting day</b>

35:26.967 --> 35:30.069
<b>because we are going to have</b>
<b>three artists in the bottom</b>

35:30.070 --> 35:31.737
<b>on portrait day</b>

35:31.738 --> 35:34.840
<b>who each did</b>
<b>a pretty great portrait.</b>

35:34.841 --> 35:36.709
<b>- Wow, it's gonna get heated.</b>

35:36.710 --> 35:38.711
<b>- Yeah.</b>
<b>- Really heated.</b>

35:38.712 --> 35:40.413
<b>- Tough day, peers.</b>

35:40.414 --> 35:42.049
<b>We'll see what happens.</b>

35:51.591 --> 35:53.059
<b>- All right, guys.</b>

35:53.060 --> 35:56.929
<b>Jury of peers, who are you</b>
<b>sending down for elimination?</b>

35:56.930 --> 35:59.999
<b> <i>♪</i> </b>

36:00.000 --> 36:03.436
<b>- We are undecided</b>
<b>between Nikki and Kevin.</b>

36:03.437 --> 36:04.770
<b>- Three against three.</b>

36:04.771 --> 36:10.109
<b>Then we'll see Nikki,</b>
<b>Kevin, and Ryan...</b>

36:10.110 --> 36:12.878
<b>and everybody else downstairs.</b>

36:12.879 --> 36:14.613
<b>- Didn't see that one coming.</b>

36:14.614 --> 36:15.716
<b>- Let's go.</b>

36:28.161 --> 36:30.629
<b>- Today you tattooed portraits.</b>

36:30.630 --> 36:33.733
<b>Based on your work,</b>
<b>one of you will close shop.</b>

36:33.734 --> 36:35.801
<b>Time to hear</b>
<b>from the jury of peers.</b>

36:35.802 --> 36:38.637
<b>Now, I understand that you</b>
<b>did not reach a decision.</b>

36:38.638 --> 36:39.672
<b>Is that accurate?</b>

36:39.673 --> 36:41.407
<b>- It was a hard split.</b>

36:41.408 --> 36:43.809
<b>There was no moving anybody.</b>

36:43.810 --> 36:47.680
<b>But me, Nikki,</b>
<b>Ryan voted for Kevin.</b>

36:47.681 --> 36:50.816
<b>And Nate, Gian, and Kevin</b>
<b>voted for Nikki.</b>

36:50.817 --> 36:52.385
<b>- Anyone with eyes, I feel like,</b>

36:52.386 --> 36:54.820
<b>would say that mine</b>
<b>looks more like the picture</b>

36:54.821 --> 36:56.822
<b>than Nikki's does.</b>

36:56.823 --> 37:00.226
<b>- His is gonna have no nose</b>
<b>within a couple months.</b>

37:00.227 --> 37:02.695
<b>- Kevin, what I'm missing</b>
<b>in your face is your liner</b>

37:02.696 --> 37:04.196
<b> <i>so that it won't disappear,</i> </b>

37:04.197 --> 37:06.999
<b> <i>because your tones are very</i> </b>
<b> <i>close to your canvas.</i> </b>

37:07.000 --> 37:08.701
<b>- These light colors,</b>
<b>these things are gonna fade</b>

37:08.702 --> 37:09.969
<b> <i>faster than all the rest.</i> </b>

37:09.970 --> 37:11.871
<b>- Had I known that everybody</b>
<b>in the room</b>

37:11.872 --> 37:13.005
<b>was doing black and gray,</b>

37:13.006 --> 37:14.106
<b>I would have jumped</b>
<b>in that pool too</b>

37:14.107 --> 37:15.274
<b>and would have did</b>
<b>black and gray.</b>

37:15.275 --> 37:16.609
<b>- But you were confident</b>
<b>in the color.</b>

37:16.610 --> 37:18.210
<b>I walked in, and you had</b>
<b>50 colors poured out,</b>

37:18.211 --> 37:19.945
<b>and you were like,</b>
<b>"I feel good doing color."</b>

37:19.946 --> 37:21.414
<b>So I can't get in your ear.</b>

37:21.415 --> 37:23.649
<b>I've been in your ear</b>
<b>from day one,</b>

37:23.650 --> 37:25.618
<b>but I can't get you</b>
<b>to change your ways.</b>

37:25.619 --> 37:27.286
<b>You do what you do always.</b>

37:27.287 --> 37:29.221
<b>- But accuracy being</b>
<b>the word of the day,</b>

37:29.222 --> 37:32.158
<b>Nikki's tattoo might be</b>
<b>the most inaccurate tattoo,</b>

37:32.159 --> 37:34.393
<b> <i>because it looks</i> </b>
<b> <i>the least like the kid.</i> </b>

37:34.394 --> 37:35.628
<b>- If I wanted to do it</b>

37:35.629 --> 37:37.863
<b>as accurate to that photo</b>
<b>as possible,</b>

37:37.864 --> 37:40.066
<b>that would have been</b>
<b>a weak tattoo</b>

37:40.067 --> 37:42.368
<b>that would not hold up</b>
<b>over time.</b>

37:42.369 --> 37:43.936
<b>- You can look at my tattoo</b>
<b>and say,</b>

37:43.937 --> 37:45.404
<b>"Okay, that's that boy."</b>

37:45.405 --> 37:46.439
<b>When you look at yours,</b>

37:46.440 --> 37:47.907
<b>it looks more</b>
<b>like a demon child.</b>

37:47.908 --> 37:48.941
<b>I don't know, like...</b>

37:48.942 --> 37:50.209
<b>- As a tattooer,</b>

37:50.210 --> 37:51.877
<b>there's certain things</b>
<b>you need to do</b>

37:51.878 --> 37:53.612
<b>to make sure</b>
<b>it stands as a tattoo.</b>

37:53.613 --> 37:55.915
<b>- There should be a level</b>
<b>that you should stop at,</b>

37:55.916 --> 37:57.717
<b>because my thing is</b>
<b>you went too far</b>

37:57.718 --> 37:59.385
<b>to the point where it doesn't</b>
<b>look like that child anymore.</b>

37:59.386 --> 38:00.586
<b>- We'll see</b>
<b>when that thing heals.</b>

38:00.587 --> 38:02.254
<b>- Yeah, whatever.</b>

38:02.255 --> 38:04.023
<b>- Yours isn't gonna look like</b>
<b>your child in a couple months.</b>

38:04.024 --> 38:05.791
<b>It's gonna be deformed,</b>
<b>not only...</b>

38:05.792 --> 38:07.426
<b>- He's gonna have that job</b>
<b>on that lip gloss.</b>

38:07.427 --> 38:09.028
<b>It's still gonna look</b>
<b>like a good tattoo</b>

38:09.029 --> 38:10.229
<b>of a 40-year-old man.</b>

38:10.230 --> 38:11.297
<b>- You know your tatt...</b>
<b>okay, really?</b>

38:11.298 --> 38:12.665
<b>- Whatever.</b>
<b>- Calm down.</b>

38:12.666 --> 38:14.266
<b>- No, you calm down.</b>
<b>Are you kidding me?</b>

38:14.267 --> 38:15.868
<b>- So it's safe to say</b>

38:15.869 --> 38:20.539
<b>that both tattoos are lacking</b>
<b>in accuracy, as is Ryan's.</b>

38:20.540 --> 38:22.274
<b>-</b><b> <i>The right eye</i> </b>
<b> <i>is a different shape.</i> </b>

38:22.275 --> 38:24.043
<b>-</b><b> <i>There's eyelashes</i> </b>
<b> <i>on her left eye</i> </b>

38:24.044 --> 38:25.544
<b> <i>that aren't in the photo.</i> </b>

38:25.545 --> 38:28.047
<b>-</b><b> <i>And Ryan put a hell</i> </b>
<b> <i>of a dimple in the cheek.</i> </b>

38:28.048 --> 38:31.684
<b>- My canvas specifically</b>
<b>requested those things from me.</b>

38:31.685 --> 38:33.719
<b>I feel like there's issues</b>
<b>in Kevin's</b>

38:33.720 --> 38:35.221
<b>that were not addressed.</b>

38:35.222 --> 38:36.222
<b>- For example?</b>

38:36.223 --> 38:37.590
<b>- The lip is a weird shape.</b>

38:37.591 --> 38:40.126
<b>The nose is too angular</b>
<b>for that little boy.</b>

38:40.127 --> 38:41.694
<b> <i>He completely missed</i> </b>
<b> <i>the shadow above the eyebrow.</i> </b>

38:41.695 --> 38:43.729
<b>- Well, my thing is</b>
<b>you changed your eyes.</b>

38:43.730 --> 38:45.297
<b>- The hair is two different...</b>
<b>excuse me.</b>

38:45.298 --> 38:46.432
<b>The hair is two different</b>
<b>colors.</b>

38:46.433 --> 38:47.967
<b>Those are all important things.</b>

38:47.968 --> 38:49.402
<b>- Well, my thing is</b>
<b>it still looks more</b>

38:49.403 --> 38:52.371
<b>like the boy in the face</b>
<b>than yours does.</b>

38:52.372 --> 38:54.907
<b>- All right, guys, time</b>
<b>to decide who's going home.</b>

38:54.908 --> 38:56.842
<b>- For me, the battle</b>
<b>for who's going home</b>

38:56.843 --> 38:58.277
<b>is between Nikki and Kevin.</b>

38:58.278 --> 39:00.479
<b>Just because Kevin's looks more</b>
<b>like the photo</b>

39:00.480 --> 39:03.582
<b>doesn't, to me, necessarily</b>
<b>mean that it's more accurate,</b>

39:03.583 --> 39:05.584
<b>because there's a lot</b>
<b>of areas of Kevin's</b>

39:05.585 --> 39:07.053
<b>that are un-accurate.</b>

39:07.054 --> 39:09.088
<b>If you're looking at which</b>
<b>one's the better tattoo,</b>

39:09.089 --> 39:10.289
<b>you're gonna go with Nikki.</b>

39:10.290 --> 39:12.591
<b>To go home,</b>
<b>my vote is for Kevin.</b>

39:12.592 --> 39:15.961
<b>- If you guys both worked</b>
<b>in my tattoo shop and did these,</b>

39:15.962 --> 39:18.431
<b>I would be more happy</b>
<b>with the one that Nikki did,</b>

39:18.432 --> 39:21.100
<b>based on knowing that it's</b>
<b>gonna look better over time.</b>

39:21.101 --> 39:22.535
<b>I'd have to say Kevin.</b>

39:22.536 --> 39:25.538
<b>- I do not know what things</b>
<b>are going to turn into.</b>

39:25.539 --> 39:29.342
<b>I think Kevin's looks more like</b>
<b>the child than Nikki's does,</b>

39:29.343 --> 39:30.910
<b>so I vote for Nikki to go home.</b>

39:30.911 --> 39:32.745
<b>- For longevity and bones,</b>

39:32.746 --> 39:36.015
<b>and what the tattoo</b>
<b>has got to be, Kevin.</b>

39:36.016 --> 39:37.650
<b>- The judges have decided.</b>

39:37.651 --> 39:41.987
<b>Kevin, you do not have</b>
<b>what it takes to be Ink Master.</b>

39:41.988 --> 39:43.389
<b>- It's been fun to watch you.</b>

39:43.390 --> 39:44.924
<b>It's a battle,</b>
<b>but honestly, Kevin,</b>

39:44.925 --> 39:46.225
<b>if you take a little direction</b>

39:46.226 --> 39:48.027
<b>from people that you</b>
<b>do love their work</b>

39:48.028 --> 39:49.929
<b>and people that you</b>
<b>want to be around,</b>

39:49.930 --> 39:52.665
<b>then you're gonna switch</b>
<b>in two seconds.</b>

39:52.666 --> 39:55.101
<b>- Please pack your machines</b>
<b>and close shop.</b>

39:55.102 --> 39:57.970
<b> <i>♪</i> </b>

39:57.971 --> 39:59.405

39:59.406 --> 40:00.973
<b> <i>just because I know</i> </b>
<b> <i>that I did a better tattoo</i> </b>

40:00.974 --> 40:02.842
<b>when it comes down to it looking</b>

40:02.843 --> 40:04.377
<b> <i>like who it's</i> </b>
<b> <i>supposed to look like.</i> </b>

40:04.378 --> 40:07.213
<b>My tattoo, ten years from now,</b>

40:07.214 --> 40:10.684
<b>but Nikki's is always gonna be</b>
<b>that unknown child.</b>

<b> <i>for me as a coach,</i> </b>

40:25.032 --> 40:26.866

40:26.867 --> 40:28.701

40:28.702 --> 40:31.303
<b> <i>or Gian and I are going down</i> </b>

40:36.076 --> 40:37.376

40:41.181 --> 40:42.915
