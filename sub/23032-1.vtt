<font color="#ffff80"><b>Fixed & Synced by bozxphd. Enjoy The Flick</b>.</font>

01:10.660 --> 01:12.720
Last night I dreamt
I could shoot like you.

01:12.730 --> 01:15.090
That's why we're here.

01:15.090 --> 01:16.900
It's a good skill to have.

01:16.900 --> 01:18.900
It's just so heavy.

01:18.900 --> 01:20.100
Sorry.

01:22.100 --> 01:24.070
They're making them lighter now.

01:24.070 --> 01:26.200
I'll get one for you.

01:28.070 --> 01:29.240
Now...

01:31.080 --> 01:33.110
Squeeze the trigger.

01:34.110 --> 01:35.410
Just squeeze it, Charlotte. I am.

01:35.420 --> 01:37.880
You're going to have to squeeze it harder.
But I'm squeezing it.

01:37.890 --> 01:39.950
Ooh! Whoo!

01:41.050 --> 01:42.690
I pulled the trigger at least.

01:42.690 --> 01:44.730
You're aiming for the tins.

01:44.730 --> 01:47.230
You really need to be prepared
for life out here, darling.

01:47.230 --> 01:49.860
I am prepared.
I pulled the trigger.

02:41.950 --> 02:43.280
Oh, Betty.

02:43.280 --> 02:45.750
I hate guns.

02:45.750 --> 02:46.960
A nice sweet tea, ma'am?

02:46.960 --> 02:49.960
Yes, thank you.

03:17.390 --> 03:19.090
Thank you. Betty!

03:19.090 --> 03:21.010
When a lady perspires,
she uses her handkerchief.

03:22.390 --> 03:24.630
Thank you, ma'am.

03:30.970 --> 03:34.270
So, he says, "Why wasn't Jesus
born in New Zealand?"

03:34.270 --> 03:36.040
And the other chap says,

03:36.040 --> 03:38.940
"Because they couldn't find
three wise men and a virgin."

03:38.940 --> 03:39.940
Oh!

03:44.650 --> 03:46.390
So, Charlotte,
how are you settling in?

03:47.390 --> 03:49.120
She's doing superbly.

03:49.120 --> 03:50.390
I know it'll take time.

03:51.390 --> 03:53.360
It's a beautiful island,
but it's just...

03:53.360 --> 03:54.960
Different.

03:54.960 --> 03:57.700
- Oxfordshire, yes?
- But born in London.

03:57.700 --> 03:59.400
Oh, dear, that place
would spoil anyone.

03:59.400 --> 04:02.170
My wife knows how much
this farm means to me.

04:02.170 --> 04:03.740
It's been a long time coming.

04:03.740 --> 04:05.400
And a dream come true.

04:05.410 --> 04:07.970
Well, my husband
can talk me into anything.

04:07.980 --> 04:12.180
You'll get used to it soon enough.
Aye, move on, we did.

04:12.180 --> 04:15.980
When I saw my first weta bug,
I thought it was a cat.

04:15.980 --> 04:19.050
- What's a weta bug?
- -Not to mention the natives.

04:19.050 --> 04:20.720
Who are not as frightening
as they look.

04:20.720 --> 04:22.506
No, but if they look
like the type that could

04:22.518 --> 04:24.160
eat you, then more
than likely, they are.

04:24.390 --> 04:25.390
Oh, George, please.

04:25.960 --> 04:27.960
Well, Charlotte needn't worry.
I mean, look at her.

04:27.960 --> 04:29.930
Not nearly enough meat
on her bones.

04:29.930 --> 04:34.210
- And how far along are you?
- Uh...

04:40.210 --> 04:41.840
Hyah!

04:43.840 --> 04:45.780
Will the grounds be finished
before the baby's born?

04:45.780 --> 04:47.080
That's the plan.

04:47.080 --> 04:50.150
So, it will just be
the three of us.

04:50.150 --> 04:51.150
No more farmhands.

04:58.490 --> 05:02.300
Hello, you beautiful baby.

05:02.300 --> 05:05.500
Could you please just stay in
there for a wee while longer?

05:05.500 --> 05:07.170
All nice and warm.

05:07.170 --> 05:09.300
Until we get the roof on?

05:09.300 --> 05:11.810
And then the house is all yours.

05:11.810 --> 05:13.980
How about that?

05:31.090 --> 05:32.190
Oh. Oh!

05:32.190 --> 05:33.460
Ohh!

05:33.460 --> 05:35.260
Whoo! David!

05:35.260 --> 05:36.770
Oh! Oh, David! Honey?

05:36.770 --> 05:38.430
Coming!

05:38.440 --> 05:40.440
- Charlotte!
- Oh! Oh.

06:39.930 --> 06:41.870
Drop your gun!

06:41.870 --> 06:43.530
Back over there! David, don't!

06:43.540 --> 06:46.400
Darling, just stay calm.

06:46.410 --> 06:47.540
Arthur...

06:47.540 --> 06:50.040
Please, move over there.

06:50.040 --> 06:52.510
P-Please, don't hurt my son.

06:52.510 --> 06:55.120
Back over there.

06:56.120 --> 06:58.150
Arthur, darling.

06:58.150 --> 06:59.150
Now, the safe.

06:59.390 --> 07:00.920
We don't have a safe.

07:00.920 --> 07:03.190
- All right, just please...

07:03.190 --> 07:04.430
please.

07:06.430 --> 07:07.590
Why are you doing this?
David.

07:09.400 --> 07:10.560
After I helped you.

07:10.560 --> 07:12.200
Everything in it.

07:14.400 --> 07:16.940
I gave you work
when you needed it.

07:16.940 --> 07:18.980
Everything!

07:19.980 --> 07:22.240
That is everything.

07:22.240 --> 07:24.450
A roof over your head.
Food from our stove!

07:24.450 --> 07:25.450
Shut your mouth now.

07:26.380 --> 07:28.520
Back to bed!
Back!

07:29.520 --> 07:32.320
If either of you
leave this room,

07:32.320 --> 07:34.350
your boy is for the worms.

07:34.360 --> 07:35.360
Am I understood?

07:38.460 --> 07:40.430
Oh!

07:40.430 --> 07:41.430
Ch-Charlotte.

07:46.400 --> 07:47.580
Go.

08:50.670 --> 08:51.870
And you say he worked for you?

08:52.400 --> 08:56.010
Why do you keep asking the same questions?
This is madness.

08:56.010 --> 08:57.440
My husband would take in strays.

08:57.440 --> 08:59.650
He always said he was
willing to help anyone

08:59.650 --> 09:02.140
who would work an
honest day, so yes.

09:02.150 --> 09:04.680
He knew him.
They all knew him.

09:04.680 --> 09:06.550
Will you find my son?

09:06.550 --> 09:10.660
Well, it's a, uh... It's a lot
of land to cover, Mrs. Lockton.

09:10.660 --> 09:12.470
We'll do our best.

09:20.470 --> 09:23.570
If my husband knew him, then
you must have known him too.

09:23.570 --> 09:26.700
I've seen how you've befriended each and
every one of them that came through.

09:26.700 --> 09:28.540
Ma'am, I didn't.
I swear.

09:28.540 --> 09:29.770
They were your friends.

09:29.780 --> 09:33.310
I was only being welcoming like
Mr. Lockton would have wanted.

09:33.310 --> 09:35.680
- Tell me who it was.
- Ma'am...

09:36.680 --> 09:38.750
Look at me!

09:39.750 --> 09:41.590
Tell me who it was!

09:41.590 --> 09:43.320
I don't know who it was.

09:43.320 --> 09:46.060
- I didn't seem 'im up close.
- No.

09:46.060 --> 09:47.760
Then pack your bags! Now!

09:47.760 --> 09:49.410
Ma'am, please!

10:00.410 --> 10:03.680
Ma'am, it's been three months.

10:03.680 --> 10:05.750
And we're sorry,
Mrs. Lockton.

10:05.750 --> 10:08.350
We've looked high and low.

10:08.350 --> 10:10.520
We've combed
the entire district.

10:10.520 --> 10:12.290
My advice...

10:13.290 --> 10:14.560
is it's...

10:15.560 --> 10:17.260
It's time to move on.

10:54.260 --> 10:56.100
- Mrs. Lockton?
- Yes.

10:56.100 --> 10:57.740
From the post office.

11:05.710 --> 11:06.880
Ohh!

11:08.880 --> 11:10.150
Rider, wait!

11:10.150 --> 11:11.590
Wait! Ma'am?

11:14.590 --> 11:17.620
"Your son is alive and well.
Your son is alive."

11:18.620 --> 11:20.220
"If you want to see him again,

11:20.230 --> 11:23.290
place 500 pounds in the Bank
of New Zealand by Friday next

11:23.290 --> 11:25.630
to the account set up
in your husband's name.

11:25.630 --> 11:28.830
Attempt to trace the money
or go to the police

11:28.830 --> 11:30.730
and you will never see
your son again."

11:30.730 --> 11:33.730
W-When was this delivered to you?
Three days ago.

11:33.740 --> 11:34.870
From where?

11:34.870 --> 11:36.410
Pass me the envelope, ma'am.

11:37.410 --> 11:40.130
This was launched in Corktown. South
of here. About half a days away.

11:40.410 --> 11:41.410
How would I get there?

11:41.410 --> 11:43.180
There's a train
from Little Hills.

11:43.180 --> 11:45.590
But Corktown, Mrs. Lockton.
Will you be traveling alone?

11:46.590 --> 11:48.220
Yes.

11:48.220 --> 11:49.720
As soon as I can.

12:13.850 --> 12:15.250
Excuse me.

12:15.250 --> 12:17.460
Where's the post office? It's just there.

12:30.360 --> 12:31.830
Can I help you, miss?

12:31.830 --> 12:34.440
This was posted from here,
I believe.

12:36.440 --> 12:38.700
I believe
it would have been, yes.

12:38.700 --> 12:39.810
Did it originate here?

12:41.810 --> 12:43.340
Not so sure about that, miss.

12:43.340 --> 12:45.280
So it might have been shipped
from somewhere else?

12:45.280 --> 12:47.580
May well have done
exactly that, yes.

12:48.580 --> 12:49.580
Where?

12:49.580 --> 12:51.320
No idea.

12:51.320 --> 12:52.850
This town is
the end of the line.

12:52.850 --> 12:54.420
The other side of those hills,

12:54.420 --> 12:56.500
people are scattered every
which way for days on end.

12:58.460 --> 12:59.740
Sorry I couldn't be
of more help.

13:01.500 --> 13:03.700
Where might I find
the Bank of New Zealand?

13:05.700 --> 13:07.830
Well, you're looking at it.

13:07.840 --> 13:10.410
I'm the closest thing you'll
find this far from Nelson.

13:11.410 --> 13:13.440
You hold an account
in the name of Lockton.

13:13.440 --> 13:14.610
Lockton.

13:15.610 --> 13:16.690
Lockton.

13:25.690 --> 13:27.970
Looks like I can
finally help you today.

13:37.970 --> 13:39.500
Goldtown Hotel?

13:39.500 --> 13:41.370
All those accounts
are held there?

13:41.370 --> 13:43.310
Goldtown Hotel.
Aye.

13:43.310 --> 13:45.440
Diggers' money.

13:45.440 --> 13:48.380
It's held at hotel
before it gets sent to bank.

13:48.380 --> 13:49.940
Can I get there from here?

13:49.950 --> 13:52.850
If you're willing to travel
for a week.

13:52.850 --> 13:54.020
Maybe more.

13:54.020 --> 13:57.020
Only way through is
that mountain, see?

13:57.020 --> 14:00.320
Plenty of lunatics heading over
that way, chasing their fortune.

14:00.320 --> 14:02.030
Plenty heading back too.

14:02.030 --> 14:03.930
They're starving to death,
they are.

14:03.930 --> 14:06.060
But I can get over there,
from here?

14:06.060 --> 14:08.470
Ask the Fräulein.

14:08.470 --> 14:11.370
She'll know when there's
a party heading out.

14:11.370 --> 14:12.880
Across the street there.

14:16.870 --> 14:18.880
No journey for a lady, miss.

14:20.880 --> 14:22.760
If you don't mind my saying so.

14:50.540 --> 14:52.040
Give the women the vote.

14:52.040 --> 14:53.780
Votes for women.

14:53.780 --> 14:55.650
Take a flyer.

14:55.650 --> 14:56.920
Votes for women.

15:01.920 --> 15:04.420
Looks like we just picked
the wrong time to leave.

15:04.420 --> 15:06.420
Don't mind me, missy.

15:06.420 --> 15:08.030
I'll see you later.

15:08.030 --> 15:10.960
I'll even pay you extra if you
keep that pretty little hat on.

15:13.000 --> 15:14.400
No, I'm not going down
any lower.

15:15.400 --> 15:17.370
No, no, don't be cheeky.

15:17.370 --> 15:19.740
Yeah.

15:19.740 --> 15:22.910
Oi! Copping a feel
without paying?

15:23.950 --> 15:26.010
Get off me.

15:26.010 --> 15:27.950
No.

15:28.950 --> 15:30.850
I'm looking for the Fräulein.

15:30.850 --> 15:32.150
Are you working? No.

15:32.150 --> 15:34.020
Are you the Fräulein?

15:34.020 --> 15:36.060
No. Right.

15:36.060 --> 15:37.990
Come on then.

15:38.990 --> 15:40.670
No! You'll
have to wait.

15:43.670 --> 15:44.670
Come along.

15:56.440 --> 15:58.850
Come here, darling.
I don't bite.

16:00.850 --> 16:01.850
Hey!

16:03.490 --> 16:04.770
Whoo!

16:22.740 --> 16:25.210
I was told there might be some
gentlemen heading to Goldtown.

16:25.210 --> 16:27.140
Gentlemen?

16:27.140 --> 16:30.020
There are none of those here.

16:33.020 --> 16:35.020
You're a digger?
No.

16:36.050 --> 16:38.820
Then only one other thing
you can be.

16:38.820 --> 16:42.890
And if you are,
you and me need a deal.

16:42.890 --> 16:47.130
No woman in Goldtown makes
money without dealing with me.

16:47.130 --> 16:50.600
I'm not a digger,
nor anything else.

16:50.600 --> 16:53.510
I just want to get to
Goldtown for my own reasons.

16:54.510 --> 16:55.910
Ten pounds. To get to Goldtown?

16:55.910 --> 16:57.980
Ten pounds!

17:00.980 --> 17:02.180
Bully!

17:04.180 --> 17:06.020
Tell Bully where you go.

17:10.020 --> 17:11.660
Excuse me?

17:14.660 --> 17:17.190
The Fräulein says
you're heading to Goldtown.

17:17.200 --> 17:18.500
Aye.
In the morning.

17:18.500 --> 17:21.170
Taking supplies.

17:21.170 --> 17:22.670
Girls too.

17:23.670 --> 17:26.200
- Well, I'd like to come along.
- Would you?

17:26.200 --> 17:27.940
I've paid her to get there.

17:27.940 --> 17:30.210
No, you haven't.

17:30.210 --> 17:31.750
You paid Fräulein...

17:33.750 --> 17:34.890
to get to me.

17:38.890 --> 17:41.260
So to get to Goldtown?

17:42.260 --> 17:43.990
Can you do that?

17:47.830 --> 17:50.230
Hmm? No.

17:50.230 --> 17:52.300
Or even that?

17:52.300 --> 17:54.870
Everything will be fine!
Everything will be fine!

17:58.870 --> 18:00.210
No.

18:03.210 --> 18:06.150
No. I can't.

18:06.150 --> 18:07.950
But...

18:08.950 --> 18:11.090
I can do this.

18:17.960 --> 18:19.170
Fifty.

18:32.170 --> 18:35.680
You know, you shouldn't be flashing
your jewelry around like that.

18:35.680 --> 18:37.310
Not in a place like this.

18:37.310 --> 18:40.810
And, uh,
you've just been fleeced.

18:40.820 --> 18:42.250
Not if you take me to Goldtown.

18:49.760 --> 18:52.170
Yee-haw!

19:01.170 --> 19:02.240
You still coming?

19:02.240 --> 19:03.870
That's what we discussed.

19:03.870 --> 19:06.750
See any whores on your way out?

19:12.750 --> 19:15.850
When you're ready,
get in that one.

19:15.850 --> 19:17.400
Thank you.

19:25.400 --> 19:26.700
Easier without this, miss.

19:35.710 --> 19:38.210
Thank you, ladies.
I'll have a look.

19:38.210 --> 19:39.640
Good luck!

19:39.650 --> 19:41.010
One day, we're gonna vote.

19:41.010 --> 19:44.020
Women are gonna vote and two fingers
to anyone who tries to stop us.

19:44.020 --> 19:45.970
You'll still be a two-bit whore.
Aye.

19:45.970 --> 19:47.960
A two-bit whore with a vote,
though, eh?

19:55.960 --> 19:59.830
Jesus.
Two weeks in that shitbox?

19:59.830 --> 20:03.050
You really know how to make
a girl feel special.

20:19.050 --> 20:21.020
Silk.

20:23.020 --> 20:24.020
Silk.

21:07.070 --> 21:08.070
So you're a dancer?

21:08.900 --> 21:11.070
She look like a bloody dancer?

21:11.070 --> 21:13.510
Never turned a trick
neither, I bet.

21:13.510 --> 21:14.980
What's your name?

21:15.980 --> 21:16.910
Charlotte.

21:16.910 --> 21:19.010
That's a pretty name.

21:19.010 --> 21:19.950
I'm Heather.

21:19.950 --> 21:23.450
That's Flamenco.
Well, we call her Flamenco.

21:23.450 --> 21:24.950
What's your real name again?

21:24.950 --> 21:27.350
Maria Theresa
Angelica Evita Pasimos.

21:27.350 --> 21:29.320
Flamenco.

21:30.320 --> 21:31.860
What are you doing here?

21:31.860 --> 21:34.109
There's plenty of people
who need Goldtown's

21:34.121 --> 21:35.830
money more than
the likes of you.

21:35.830 --> 21:38.040
What would you know
about the likes of me?

21:40.040 --> 21:43.250
You're a snotty bitch,
that much I do know.

21:48.250 --> 21:49.480
That's Honey.

23:09.600 --> 23:11.870
What do you think you're doing?
Those are mine.

23:13.870 --> 23:17.240
I asked you what do you think you're doing?
Those are my shoes.

23:17.240 --> 23:18.970
Looks to me like
you've got plenty.

23:18.970 --> 23:21.140
You have no right to steal.

23:21.140 --> 23:24.180
So take them back.
Go ahead.

23:25.180 --> 23:26.910
<i>Vamos.</i>

23:26.910 --> 23:28.260
Take them off me.

23:41.260 --> 23:43.270
There.

23:44.270 --> 23:46.100
It's a matching set.

23:46.100 --> 23:48.140
If you're feeling generous,
I'll take the petticoat.

24:00.450 --> 24:02.450
That...

24:02.450 --> 24:04.320
Give me back... Where's my...

24:07.220 --> 24:09.460
You stole my money!

24:13.000 --> 24:14.500
Ladies.
Ladies.

24:16.500 --> 24:18.330
First night.

24:19.330 --> 24:21.290
She stole my money.
I take her shoes.

24:21.290 --> 24:23.500
- My shoes and my money.
- Is it in there?

24:23.510 --> 24:27.310
No, but she's wearing my shoes,
so she must have taken my money.

24:29.310 --> 24:31.510
Someone else
must have taken it then.

24:31.510 --> 24:34.280
Aye, so, uh,

24:34.280 --> 24:36.350
now you're accusing
the rest of us, eh?

24:36.350 --> 24:39.390
No, but all the money
I had in that bag is gone.

24:39.390 --> 24:42.090
Oh, would that be the stash that you
were flashing around last night?

24:42.090 --> 24:44.130
Like it was everyone else's
but your own?

24:44.130 --> 24:47.060
You stayed the night
at Madame Fräulein's.

24:47.060 --> 24:50.370
The moment you closed your eyes,

24:50.370 --> 24:53.370
you waved good-bye
to everything you own.

24:56.370 --> 24:59.680
Just be thankful we're going
to Goldtown, princess.

24:59.680 --> 25:03.420
You wouldn't believe what some will
pay to see you flash your titties.

26:28.840 --> 26:30.370
We should bury him.

26:30.370 --> 26:34.150
Waste of time. Birds gotta
eat, same as worms.

26:38.140 --> 26:39.450
We're moving on.

27:11.410 --> 27:12.680
Shoot it.

27:14.680 --> 27:16.890
Go, go, go, go, go!

27:31.470 --> 27:33.870
Let's make this easy,
eh, fellas?

27:33.870 --> 27:36.340
All we want is the food.

27:36.340 --> 27:39.240
And the whiskey.

27:39.240 --> 27:43.280
Maybe these lasses for the ride.
And we'll be on our way.

27:45.280 --> 27:46.725
It's not gonna happen, pal.

27:46.737 --> 27:49.450
Then you've just come to
the end of the line, pal!

29:07.870 --> 29:09.000
It's all right.

29:13.940 --> 29:16.780
You might want to look away.

29:54.320 --> 29:56.950
You've got the wrong leg!

29:56.950 --> 29:58.950
Oh! Ah!

30:05.430 --> 30:07.060
And then what at the end?

30:07.060 --> 30:09.000
It's finished!

30:12.800 --> 30:13.800
We'll practice, okay?

30:16.710 --> 30:18.040
Come on, princess.

30:18.040 --> 30:21.010
Let your hair down
for once in your life.

30:21.010 --> 30:22.950
You're alive.

30:29.320 --> 30:30.990
You mind?

30:30.990 --> 30:32.530
I would like that.

30:42.500 --> 30:44.640
There must be
something special...

30:45.640 --> 30:46.610
in Goldtown.

30:46.610 --> 30:48.640
For a lady like you
to do something like this.

30:50.640 --> 30:54.650
My son. He was stolen by
the man who killed my husband.

30:57.650 --> 30:59.720
And you think he's in Goldtown?

31:01.720 --> 31:03.720
You know who he is? The man? No.

31:03.920 --> 31:08.890
If you start knocking on doors,
you see, word will spread fast.

31:08.890 --> 31:11.130
So you need to move faster.

31:12.130 --> 31:14.400
Do you live there in Goldtown?

31:14.400 --> 31:16.800
We work for the boss,
but we're not diggers.

31:18.670 --> 31:20.170
So, say you find this boy.

31:20.170 --> 31:22.010
I will find my son.

31:23.010 --> 31:25.010
Then what?

31:25.010 --> 31:27.380
I was gonna pay him.
The man.

31:27.380 --> 31:31.650
You think it would be that simple
after he killed your husband?

31:31.650 --> 31:34.920
Well, it'll be 10 times
less simple without money.

31:37.920 --> 31:38.920
I don't know.

31:44.900 --> 31:46.630
I will steal him back.

31:46.640 --> 31:48.540
You got a gun?

31:48.540 --> 31:51.100
Do you even know
how to shoot it?

31:52.100 --> 31:55.110
Ah.
In the name of the wee man.

31:57.440 --> 31:59.480
Well, we're still a week away.

31:59.480 --> 32:01.850
We'll have to do
something about that.

32:01.850 --> 32:03.720
Thank you.

32:03.720 --> 32:05.650
Don't thank me.

32:05.650 --> 32:07.090
Not till the boy's
back in your arms.

32:07.460 --> 32:09.520
And for what it's worth,

32:09.530 --> 32:11.730
what you just told me there...

32:12.730 --> 32:14.490
you shouldn't have told me
any of that.

32:14.490 --> 32:16.960
Not a single word.

32:16.960 --> 32:18.460
In case you don't know who I am.

32:18.470 --> 32:19.770
Yes, I do.
You saved my life.

32:19.770 --> 32:22.740
Even someone who saves
your life, princess.

32:22.740 --> 32:24.910
You don't tell them stuff
like that, okay?

32:29.850 --> 32:31.910
I'd make some friends.

32:31.920 --> 32:34.630
Christ, eh? You're gonna
need them where we're going.

32:43.630 --> 32:46.160
We're a man down. We gotta
know you can defend yourselves.

32:46.160 --> 32:48.530
Again.

32:48.530 --> 32:51.630
You can act fast. He's not gonna
stand there waiting for you to aim,

32:51.640 --> 32:53.100
so shoot your bloody guns.

32:53.100 --> 32:55.710
Ah!

32:55.710 --> 32:57.810
Well, at least
one of you will live.

32:57.810 --> 32:59.740
Again.

32:59.740 --> 33:02.510
You're thinking too much.
Come on. Again.

33:03.510 --> 33:05.080
I'm gonna count to ten.

33:05.080 --> 33:08.480
One, two, three...

33:08.490 --> 33:10.920
When you gotta shoot, shoot.
Don't think.

33:12.920 --> 33:14.840
Reload. Again.

34:06.880 --> 34:08.880
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

34:09.880 --> 34:10.980
Come on.

34:10.980 --> 34:12.920
Come on!

34:12.920 --> 34:14.550
Come on! Come on.

34:14.550 --> 34:16.260
Step off!

34:19.260 --> 34:21.190
Hunter.

34:21.190 --> 34:23.560
Come on.
Let's get a move on.

34:23.560 --> 34:26.100
It's not the river.
It's the wagon.

34:26.100 --> 34:29.040
Matai, Klaus, unhitch the wagon.

34:29.040 --> 34:30.800
Right.
Everyone out.

34:30.810 --> 34:32.810
Why?
Because we're stopping here.

34:34.780 --> 34:37.010
Move your asses.
Come on.

34:39.010 --> 34:43.949
Don't tell me there ain't an easier
way to get to Goldtown than this.

34:44.949 --> 34:47.290
It's the axle, boss.

34:47.290 --> 34:49.159
We'll figure it out.

34:49.159 --> 34:50.790
It's busted.

34:50.790 --> 34:52.699
Hunter, we'll figure it out.

34:57.700 --> 34:58.910
What's that on her neck?

35:02.900 --> 35:04.640
It's a tattoo.

35:04.640 --> 35:06.770
A tattoo of what?

35:06.770 --> 35:08.180
Prison.

35:09.180 --> 35:10.980
She spent six years as a maid.

35:10.980 --> 35:12.980
But being told what to do
her whole life

35:12.980 --> 35:15.220
sent her spitting
in the master's food.

35:15.220 --> 35:17.390
And a lot else besides.

35:17.390 --> 35:20.090
Locked up for three years.

35:20.090 --> 35:22.360
Was Flamenco in prison too? Nah.

35:22.360 --> 35:23.990
Shipwreck or some such.

35:24.000 --> 35:26.330
She survived,
but her family didn't.

35:26.330 --> 35:28.060
Pretty girl like that though.

35:28.060 --> 35:32.370
She can make her way. If she
can stomach what it takes.

35:32.370 --> 35:33.680
And you?

35:42.680 --> 35:43.750
All right, pull!

35:47.750 --> 35:49.750
Got it?
Yeah.

35:49.990 --> 35:52.320
Just get it in there.

35:52.320 --> 35:53.960
Hold on, one second.

35:53.960 --> 35:55.330
Yeah!

35:56.330 --> 35:57.660
Come on! Faster!

35:59.660 --> 36:02.870
Put your back in it, man!

36:02.870 --> 36:03.970
That's it!

36:05.970 --> 36:07.000
Bully!

36:07.010 --> 36:08.910
Hey! Hey!

36:08.910 --> 36:11.080
The axle.
It's pinning him down.

36:11.080 --> 36:14.240
He was stuck on the axle.
Lift it! Lift that pole!

36:14.240 --> 36:15.780
Lift it up!
Get it off him!

36:15.780 --> 36:17.380
Come on!
Get him off the axle!

36:17.380 --> 36:18.450
One, two, three!
Go! Pull!

36:19.450 --> 36:21.390
Please, God.

36:22.390 --> 36:24.120
No! Get him up!

36:24.120 --> 36:25.720
Come on!

36:25.720 --> 36:27.360
Come on!
Get this stuff off!

36:27.360 --> 36:29.190
Hurry up, hurry up!

36:29.190 --> 36:31.000
Help him, please!
Somebody!

36:31.000 --> 36:33.170
Lift! Lift him!

36:33.170 --> 36:35.870
Ain't you ever lifted, boy?

36:35.870 --> 36:38.740
Come on!
Get it off! Come on!

36:38.740 --> 36:40.740
Clear that stuff!
Come on! Come on!

36:41.740 --> 36:42.740
Come on, man!

36:43.440 --> 36:44.440
Two, three, go!

36:45.440 --> 36:47.280
Come on!

36:47.280 --> 36:48.750
Come on, man!

37:24.050 --> 37:27.520
We get the wagon loaded with whatever
we can manage, and we move on.

37:27.520 --> 37:29.250
We're never gonna make it.

37:29.260 --> 37:31.890
So what are you suggesting
we do instead, sweetheart?

37:31.890 --> 37:34.030
Turn back.
Get home alive, at least.

37:34.030 --> 37:35.800
You saying I can't get us there?

37:35.800 --> 37:38.370
Are you saying you can?

37:39.370 --> 37:40.900
Fine.

37:40.900 --> 37:42.940
Turn back.

37:42.940 --> 37:45.210
I'll bury you on the way back.

37:45.210 --> 37:47.040
I need to get to Goldtown.

37:47.040 --> 37:48.980
There's no point
in arriving dead.

37:48.980 --> 37:51.210
I'll show you dead, bitch!

37:51.210 --> 37:53.780
You want to see dead?
I'll give you dead!

37:53.780 --> 37:56.480
Hunter! Hunter!

37:56.480 --> 38:00.160
Leave her be.

38:05.460 --> 38:06.900
All right.

38:06.900 --> 38:09.000
We make the wagon good.

38:09.000 --> 38:12.420
We move on, and we camp by dark.

39:32.990 --> 39:34.990
See, here's the thing.

39:35.990 --> 39:37.490
You don't look like a whore.

39:44.130 --> 39:45.130
Mmm.

39:46.600 --> 39:49.270
You don't smell like a whore.

39:50.270 --> 39:52.610
I wonder what you do
do like a whore.

39:57.610 --> 39:59.050
<i>Hola, guapo.</i>

40:00.050 --> 40:02.220
<i>Thought I your señorita.</i>

40:04.220 --> 40:05.960
<i>Vamos, mi amor.</i>

40:34.720 --> 40:36.150
Thank you.

40:38.150 --> 40:39.620
Honey told me
you lost your family.

40:41.620 --> 40:42.730
I lost mine too.

40:46.730 --> 40:47.780
No talk of family.

41:32.780 --> 41:34.440
They're here, boys!

41:34.440 --> 41:36.350
The girls are here!

41:45.260 --> 41:46.260
Hello, lads!

41:49.230 --> 41:51.360
Whoo!

42:05.310 --> 42:06.750
What you got there?
I'll take it all.

42:25.270 --> 42:26.270
Hello!

42:55.860 --> 42:57.670
My cases are in there, love.

42:57.670 --> 42:59.430
How are we?

42:59.430 --> 43:02.100
Nice to see you all.
Have you had a bath?

43:03.100 --> 43:05.240
Oh, then you might
need another one!

43:05.240 --> 43:07.670
Bertie!
They're here!

43:07.680 --> 43:08.840
The lasses are here!

43:20.590 --> 43:22.190
Well, ladies, ladies, ladies.

43:22.190 --> 43:24.190
Welcome, welcome.

43:25.200 --> 43:26.630
Well, well, well.

43:26.630 --> 43:28.430
What a divine selection.

43:28.430 --> 43:31.170
I'm Bertie Russell.
At your attendance.

43:31.170 --> 43:32.870
I trust your journey
treated you well?

43:32.870 --> 43:34.570
No. It was shit.

43:34.570 --> 43:36.710
Oh, well, uh...

43:36.710 --> 43:39.710
Let's hope that your stay with us
proves to be just the opposite.

43:39.710 --> 43:41.380
Delightful, in fact.

43:41.380 --> 43:43.410
And fruitful to us all.

43:44.410 --> 43:46.880
Uh, Mr. McCullen has a
meeting at West Port,

43:46.890 --> 43:51.520
so it's my honorable duty
to escort you to...

43:52.520 --> 43:53.800
well, your boudoirs.

44:00.800 --> 44:03.400
Ah, an English rose.
I like it.

44:03.400 --> 44:05.570
You're gonna go down a treat.

44:05.570 --> 44:07.200
All right, gentlemen.

44:07.210 --> 44:08.570
Give the ladies time
to freshen up,

44:08.570 --> 44:11.750
and after that, you can throw all
your money and yourselves at them.

44:13.740 --> 44:18.350
Soon all this will be out of here, and
we'll have more rooms for more girlies.

44:18.350 --> 44:19.620
This is just the beginning.

44:19.620 --> 44:21.590
Look at that stage, ladies.

44:21.590 --> 44:23.520
Drapes will make it nice.

44:23.520 --> 44:24.590
Aye.

44:24.590 --> 44:26.620
A touch of class.

44:26.620 --> 44:29.390
Now where's the English rose?
Ah, there you are.

44:29.390 --> 44:31.530
<i>♪ She was just the sort
Of creature, boys ♪</i>

44:31.530 --> 44:33.200
<i>♪ That nature did intend ♪</i>

44:33.200 --> 44:36.900
<i>♪ To walk around the world Me
boys Without the Grecian Bend ♪</i>

44:36.900 --> 44:38.570
<i>♪ And did she wear a chignon ♪</i>

44:38.570 --> 44:40.740
<i>♪ I'll have you all to know ♪</i>

44:40.740 --> 44:45.410
<i>♪ That I met her in the garden
Where the pretties grow ♪</i>

44:45.410 --> 44:47.280
Right.

44:47.280 --> 44:49.510
I'll be doing the negotiating
on your behalf.

44:49.510 --> 44:52.590
Make sure you're well kept,
safe and well fed.

44:52.590 --> 44:55.220
And all for a mere
35 percent of your takings.

44:55.220 --> 44:56.890
Wait.
Are you the boss?

44:56.890 --> 44:59.260
No.
Mr. McCullen is the boss.

44:59.260 --> 45:01.530
Aye. Then it's Mr.
McCullen we work for.

45:01.530 --> 45:02.890
As do I.

45:02.890 --> 45:04.700
It's his 35 percent, not mine.

45:04.700 --> 45:07.800
Twenty percent or I glue
my bloomers to my ass.

45:07.800 --> 45:12.540
Well, perhaps we could come to some
kind of quid pro quo arrangement.

45:12.540 --> 45:15.710
Just show us the rooms,
you dirty little bastard.

45:15.710 --> 45:18.280
It's good to have a friend
sometimes, you know.

45:18.280 --> 45:19.950
Aye, it depends on the friend. Right.

45:19.950 --> 45:20.950
Onwards and upwards.

45:21.480 --> 45:23.320
This is just like the big house.

45:23.320 --> 45:24.790
How many bloody stairs?

45:27.290 --> 45:30.960
Here's where you'll be
providing your fleshy pleasures.

45:30.960 --> 45:33.290
And over here,

45:33.290 --> 45:37.300
yet another little love grotto from
which to sing your siren songs.

45:39.300 --> 45:40.740
And over here,

45:40.740 --> 45:43.440
we have the grand suite.

45:43.440 --> 45:45.770
And the last but not the least,

45:45.770 --> 45:47.580
the not so grand suite.

45:48.580 --> 45:49.710
Very funny.

45:51.980 --> 45:55.550
Hey, what happened to the dresses?
We were promised good dresses.

45:55.550 --> 45:58.750
If Mr. McCullen gave his word,
he'll keep his word.

45:58.750 --> 46:02.830
Right. I'm gonna leave you lovely ladies
to make yourselves even lovelier.

46:03.830 --> 46:05.660
You won't be shy
of work tonight.

46:05.660 --> 46:07.060
That's for certain.

46:08.060 --> 46:09.570
Oh, shit.

46:09.570 --> 46:11.830
Won't be making anything
looking like this.

46:34.830 --> 46:36.900
They never leave you, do they?

46:41.900 --> 46:44.040
She was three.

47:01.350 --> 47:03.390
Gentlemen!
Both the drink and the ladies

47:03.390 --> 47:05.690
await your unbridled
appreciation.

47:10.990 --> 47:14.670
Well, it appears there are some
things more desirable than gold.

47:15.670 --> 47:16.840
Hello.

47:18.840 --> 47:21.080
So pleased to meet you all.

47:23.080 --> 47:24.440
Ooh, buy us some drinks.

47:24.440 --> 47:25.950
Buy me a drink?

47:27.950 --> 47:29.510
Another one.

47:30.510 --> 47:31.820
I'm so excited!

47:35.090 --> 47:37.160
Thank you.
Oh, thank you.

47:39.160 --> 47:40.960
So who's going to help me?

47:41.960 --> 47:43.100
Oh, sorry.

47:43.100 --> 47:44.100
Sorry.

47:55.010 --> 47:56.610
S-Sorry.

47:59.510 --> 48:01.180
Hello. Are you for sale?

48:01.180 --> 48:02.580
- No.
- But why?

48:02.580 --> 48:04.580
Stop it!
Give you good money.

48:04.580 --> 48:06.690
Stay with me.

48:15.460 --> 48:18.130
- Are you leaving?
- Job is done, miss.

48:19.130 --> 48:21.200
I wanted to say thank you.

48:21.200 --> 48:23.140
You be safe, now.

48:24.140 --> 48:26.140
Are you leaving too?

48:27.140 --> 48:28.610
This is not my home.

48:29.610 --> 48:30.880
I never asked your name.

48:30.880 --> 48:31.880
Matai.

48:32.480 --> 48:34.620
How often do you come
to Goldtown, Matai?

48:34.620 --> 48:36.920
When somebody needs
to get over the mountain.

48:36.920 --> 48:37.920
And say somebody did.

48:38.480 --> 48:40.020
Already you don't like it?

48:40.020 --> 48:41.720
It's not my home either.

48:41.720 --> 48:43.560
I was never planning on staying.

48:43.560 --> 48:44.560
I'll need help leaving.

48:45.490 --> 48:47.600
I can return.

48:49.600 --> 48:51.630
I don't know how long I'll need.

48:51.630 --> 48:53.470
Are you in trouble,
Miss Charlotte?

48:57.470 --> 48:59.150
I can be back in three days.

49:02.140 --> 49:04.040
Three days. Yes.
Thank you, three days.

49:33.040 --> 49:35.200
Hello.

50:03.210 --> 50:04.640
Oh.

50:04.640 --> 50:07.250
- Give reason I no pull trigger.

50:08.410 --> 50:11.050
I'm sorry. I heard crying,
and I thought the baby was sick.

50:11.050 --> 50:12.950
No sick. No. I'm sorry.

50:12.950 --> 50:15.720
- Are there any other families
here?

50:15.720 --> 50:17.990
You go now.
You no come again.

50:17.990 --> 50:19.860
Who took that portrait?
Who took that picture?

50:19.860 --> 50:21.730
- I say go!
- I have the same picture.

50:21.730 --> 50:24.060
I'm going!
I'm going!

50:25.060 --> 50:26.910
Gone.

51:18.890 --> 51:23.320
Oh, there you are.

51:23.330 --> 51:25.760
I thought you might be upstairs,
earning yourself some money.

51:25.760 --> 51:27.960
A lot of the fellas want a
taste of your wares, darlin'.

51:28.800 --> 51:30.400
Listen, walk with me.

51:30.400 --> 51:31.400
Gentlemen.

51:36.910 --> 51:39.910
If you want a bed,
a nice roof over your head,

51:39.910 --> 51:42.080
lovely fires to keep you warm,

51:42.080 --> 51:44.880
then you do what the other girlies
are doing that you rode in with.

51:44.880 --> 51:48.220
Either up there on the stage
or flat on your back.

51:48.220 --> 51:49.690
Because it's either that,

51:49.690 --> 51:52.220
or you're out the door,
and you don't come back.

51:52.220 --> 51:54.220
That's how it works.

51:54.220 --> 51:55.760
Show's in an hour.

52:01.770 --> 52:04.400
Oh, did you see their faces?

52:04.400 --> 52:06.370
They look loaded.

52:09.370 --> 52:11.210
Very nice.

52:16.210 --> 52:18.010
Is there a dress I can wear?

52:33.100 --> 52:38.010
Whoo!

52:46.010 --> 52:48.010
Whoo!

52:57.020 --> 52:58.330
Go on, girls.

53:01.330 --> 53:02.800
Oh, keep it comin'.

53:04.800 --> 53:05.800
Yes!
Oh, yeah.

53:21.750 --> 53:25.290
Oh, yeah.

53:34.390 --> 53:36.800
- Marry me!
- Which one of us?

53:36.800 --> 53:38.470
Any of you! All of you!

53:42.340 --> 53:45.070
Oh, Mr. McCullen. We weren't
expecting you back tonight.

53:45.070 --> 53:48.010
How was your day? Good, Bertie.
Thank you.

53:48.010 --> 53:52.110
So, uh, all this is yours,
the hotel? You got a wife?

53:52.110 --> 53:55.050
Mr. McCullen prefers his toffees
with the wrappers untouched.

53:57.050 --> 54:00.260
But a horse is a damn sight easier
to ride if it's been broken in.

54:04.260 --> 54:06.230
Hey.
Boss.

54:06.230 --> 54:07.830
What about Bully?

54:07.830 --> 54:09.230
He didn't make it.

54:09.230 --> 54:10.830
The gorge.

54:10.830 --> 54:12.170
We lost some supplies too.

54:12.170 --> 54:14.800
We lost too many lives
in that pass.

54:14.800 --> 54:16.270
We'll say prayers
for him Sunday.

54:21.940 --> 54:24.550
I'll send the Jameson brothers
for the supplies in the morning.

54:26.550 --> 54:28.220
Bertie?

54:28.220 --> 54:29.860
I think these ladies need a drink. Right.

54:45.600 --> 54:47.540
So.

54:47.540 --> 54:49.270
What do you cost me? No!

54:49.270 --> 54:52.010
- You don't like my money?
- That's not what I said.

54:52.010 --> 54:54.180
- You don't like me?
- Actually, I do quite like you.

54:54.180 --> 54:56.880
- My money's good, Bertie!
- I know that, Freckles.

54:56.880 --> 54:58.150
But you heard the lady.

54:58.150 --> 55:00.420
What the hell
kind of a place is this?

55:00.420 --> 55:03.160
I've got good money to spend
here for Christ's sakes!

55:08.160 --> 55:10.590
That's the last help
you'll get from me.

55:10.600 --> 55:12.310
From now on, you'll fight
them off yourself.

55:13.160 --> 55:14.900
Here. On the house.

55:14.900 --> 55:16.470
Help you to relax.

55:16.470 --> 55:17.680
Maybe loosen you up a little.

55:57.680 --> 55:58.680
I don't think so.

56:01.510 --> 56:03.150
Dangerous out there, princess.

56:06.150 --> 56:08.296
Mr. McCullen doesn't
like his ladies getting

56:08.308 --> 56:10.130
into trouble, losing
their looks now.

56:11.130 --> 56:12.430
Oh.

56:13.430 --> 56:16.430
Wouldn't mind us getting a bit
of fresh air, now, would he?

56:18.430 --> 56:20.910
Got a window in my room. All the
fresh air you need, Charlotte.

56:23.500 --> 56:24.500
Charlotte.

56:25.670 --> 56:27.270
That's the kind of name
you just wanna...

56:28.610 --> 56:30.270
wrap your mouth around,
now, isn't it?

56:56.270 --> 56:59.210
First honest days' work you've ever
done in your life, eh, princess?

57:00.210 --> 57:02.280
So what's he up to,
this McCullen?

57:02.280 --> 57:04.550
That's "Mr. McCullen"
to you.

57:04.550 --> 57:08.420
And what he's up to is making a life for
himself after all he's been through.

57:08.420 --> 57:11.620
Losing his wife and his
child, and all that he had.

57:11.620 --> 57:14.260
Some folk would simply
fall to pieces.

57:14.260 --> 57:16.560
Others stand up.
They look to their future.

57:16.560 --> 57:18.190
That's what your man's done.

57:18.190 --> 57:19.640
He's got some big plans
for Goldtown.

57:20.500 --> 57:22.200
Some grand old plans.

57:22.200 --> 57:24.710
Right.
It's time for work.

57:30.710 --> 57:32.210
Michael?

57:32.210 --> 57:34.340
Get those fucking chairs down.

57:40.080 --> 57:42.790
Right, gentlemen.
The house is open.

57:42.790 --> 57:45.190
One pound for the English
rose over there,

57:45.190 --> 57:47.160
just sitting there doing
nothing the whole time.

57:47.160 --> 57:48.290
One pound for a dance.

57:48.290 --> 57:51.330
Yes, well, fair's fair.
After all, business is business.

57:51.330 --> 57:54.060
Two pounds. Two pounds.
Any advance on two pounds?

57:54.060 --> 57:55.300
Come on, Bertie.
Three pounds.

57:55.300 --> 57:56.300
Three pounds!

57:56.500 --> 57:57.670
Four pounds, Bertie.

57:57.670 --> 57:59.670
I believe we have a winner.

58:00.200 --> 58:02.410
Oh, come on then, love.

58:02.410 --> 58:04.680
I'm the luckiest bastard
in the room!

58:04.680 --> 58:06.520
Hey, make it a fast one, boys!

58:16.520 --> 58:18.690
Don't do that!

58:18.690 --> 58:21.430
I'm flushed today, love.
I can pay extra!

58:21.430 --> 58:22.430
That's enough.

58:25.060 --> 58:26.770
It's just a misunderstanding.

58:28.770 --> 58:30.780
Bertie, give the man a refund.

58:36.780 --> 58:38.480
Will you play a slow one?

58:45.690 --> 58:46.690
You from England?

58:46.690 --> 58:48.090
Oxfordshire.

58:51.090 --> 58:52.090
Are you from the North?

58:55.530 --> 58:56.560
The North?

58:56.560 --> 58:57.870
Yes, I am.

58:58.870 --> 59:00.280
And proud.

59:09.280 --> 59:10.650
Do you have family there?

59:11.650 --> 59:13.480
I'm an only child.

59:16.480 --> 59:17.990
So what brought you here?

59:17.990 --> 59:19.120
To Goldtown?

59:19.120 --> 59:20.690
No, to the island.

59:20.690 --> 59:23.630
My husband.
He was killed.

59:28.630 --> 59:31.170
We try to make a life for
ourselves, but it's hard.

59:34.170 --> 59:35.770
Happiness finds a way, though.

59:38.770 --> 59:41.450
I pray for it every night,
Mr. McCullen.

59:43.450 --> 59:44.850
Joshua.

59:45.850 --> 59:46.850
Please.

59:56.590 --> 59:58.210
Can I show you something?

01:00:16.210 --> 01:00:18.450
Marry me.
I've got good diggings.

01:00:18.450 --> 01:00:19.650
Just ask Bertie.

01:00:19.650 --> 01:00:23.190
I'll give you six sons. You
won't find more decent than me.

01:00:23.190 --> 01:00:24.320
Have you got a ring?

01:00:27.320 --> 01:00:28.890
Come back
when you've got a ring.

01:01:00.890 --> 01:01:01.890
That's Goldtown.

01:01:12.610 --> 01:01:14.410
It's beautiful.

01:01:15.410 --> 01:01:17.680
It's what I want home
to look like in a year.

01:01:18.680 --> 01:01:20.680
Very ambitious.
Maybe.

01:01:20.810 --> 01:01:24.420
But these men have left their
families behind. They've...

01:01:24.420 --> 01:01:26.650
endured great hardship to be
masters of their own destiny.

01:01:26.650 --> 01:01:28.960
The least I can do is provide
them with what they need.

01:01:29.960 --> 01:01:31.460
They can make a life.

01:01:32.460 --> 01:01:33.630
Better than anywhere else.

01:01:37.630 --> 01:01:39.470
Yeah, I suppose that does make
me ambitious, doesn't it?

01:01:39.470 --> 01:01:41.770
Yeah.

01:01:43.770 --> 01:01:45.980
Endured great hardship.

01:01:47.980 --> 01:01:50.380
I don't think I ever understood
the meaning of those words.

01:01:53.380 --> 01:01:54.650
What did you expect?

01:01:54.650 --> 01:01:55.860
I don't know.

01:02:01.860 --> 01:02:03.730
I expected everything
to be perfect.

01:03:01.880 --> 01:03:04.420
Go, Freckles!

01:03:07.420 --> 01:03:11.060
You fellas are gonna be
so jealous of me.

01:03:11.060 --> 01:03:14.500
So jealous.

01:03:14.500 --> 01:03:17.770
Hey! You fellas gonna
be so jealous.

01:03:19.770 --> 01:03:21.110
Here.

01:03:21.110 --> 01:03:23.610
Hmm.

01:03:23.610 --> 01:03:25.410
There you go.

01:03:25.410 --> 01:03:27.080
Here.
Drink.

01:03:31.080 --> 01:03:33.420
Good boy.

01:03:34.420 --> 01:03:36.990
Yeah, well...
Lie with me.

01:03:38.990 --> 01:03:41.560
Shh.

01:03:41.560 --> 01:03:43.160
Don't pretend you know
what you're doing.

01:03:44.960 --> 01:03:49.140
You're the best of any damn
whore I ever laid eyes on.

01:03:49.140 --> 01:03:50.100
Yeah.

01:03:50.100 --> 01:03:52.140
Thank you.

01:03:52.140 --> 01:03:53.710
There we go. Shh.

01:03:55.710 --> 01:04:00.710
Guys are gonna be so jealous.

01:05:36.810 --> 01:05:38.620
I know you said I'm not welcome.

01:05:38.620 --> 01:05:40.250
- I know you said to not come back.
- I say no come back!

01:05:40.250 --> 01:05:42.090
I have the same photograph.
This is my son!

01:05:42.090 --> 01:05:45.860
He's here in Goldtown. It's the
same photograph. The same as yours.

01:05:45.860 --> 01:05:48.760
This is my baby. See, here.
You have the same photograph.

01:05:48.760 --> 01:05:51.860
Oh.
She says the tree people.

01:05:51.860 --> 01:05:53.230
Yes, tree people.

01:05:54.830 --> 01:05:57.100
Three people.
A woman beyond tree people.

01:05:57.100 --> 01:05:59.900
Where's the tree people?

01:05:59.900 --> 01:06:01.240
The woman with baby.

01:06:01.240 --> 01:06:02.710
Baby.

01:06:02.710 --> 01:06:03.710
I saw him.

01:06:03.710 --> 01:06:05.040
Bush. Tree people.

01:06:05.040 --> 01:06:06.110
Yes. Yes.

01:06:06.110 --> 01:06:07.210
Baby, through bush.

01:06:07.210 --> 01:06:08.900
Through the bush.

01:06:23.900 --> 01:06:26.700
Um, I'm looking
for a woman with a baby.

01:06:28.870 --> 01:06:31.270
Um, do you speak English?
English?

01:06:33.270 --> 01:06:34.610
Oh!

01:06:36.610 --> 01:06:38.610
Um, excuse me.
Do you speak English?

01:06:38.610 --> 01:06:40.310
- English?
- Ah, morning! Morning! You buy.

01:06:40.310 --> 01:06:42.180
Ah, yes, yes.

01:06:42.180 --> 01:06:43.850
Ah. You buy. No, no.

01:06:43.850 --> 01:06:46.150
Um, I'm looking for a woman
with this baby.

01:06:48.150 --> 01:06:49.690
Oh.

01:06:49.690 --> 01:06:51.690
A woman with...

01:06:52.120 --> 01:06:53.120
No.
You... You buy.

01:06:53.290 --> 01:06:55.060
No! I need to find
a woman with a baby.

01:06:55.060 --> 01:06:59.900
I need to find the woman
with this...

01:06:59.900 --> 01:07:02.300
You buy.

01:07:06.300 --> 01:07:07.980
Okay.

01:07:09.980 --> 01:07:12.610
English?

01:07:12.610 --> 01:07:15.650
Go up.
Woman and baby.

01:07:15.650 --> 01:07:16.650
They go.

01:07:16.650 --> 01:07:17.990
Thank you!
Thank you!

01:07:38.940 --> 01:07:42.080
Oh, child. Arthur.

01:07:43.080 --> 01:07:44.080
Hey! Hey!

01:07:45.950 --> 01:07:49.320
<i>No! Arrêté!</i>

01:07:49.320 --> 01:07:51.980
He's mine!

01:07:51.990 --> 01:07:56.360
The mother is dead!

01:07:57.360 --> 01:07:59.290
He's my son.

01:07:59.290 --> 01:08:00.900
That'll do now, princess.

01:08:02.900 --> 01:08:04.810
You give that little one
back now.

01:08:12.810 --> 01:08:15.120
You want to do this
the hard way?

01:08:26.689 --> 01:08:32.160
Why did you take my baby?

01:08:48.109 --> 01:08:50.279
You done good, Chiney.

01:08:50.279 --> 01:08:52.029
Come here.

01:09:07.029 --> 01:09:08.370
Joshua.

01:09:10.370 --> 01:09:12.210
Joshua. Um...

01:09:14.210 --> 01:09:15.770
Um.

01:09:15.779 --> 01:09:17.479
Hunter has my son.

01:09:17.479 --> 01:09:19.279
There's a lady.

01:09:20.279 --> 01:09:21.819
Or...
Joshua.

01:09:23.819 --> 01:09:26.149
Needs more milk.

01:09:30.160 --> 01:09:32.460
You have absolutely no idea
who I am, do you?

01:09:32.460 --> 01:09:34.200
Mrs. Lockton.

01:09:40.200 --> 01:09:42.439
I had a dream
just like your husband.

01:09:43.439 --> 01:09:46.069
I came to this country with a
promise from my government

01:09:46.069 --> 01:09:49.479
that the land was as ripe
as the opportunity.

01:09:52.479 --> 01:09:54.149
Everything I had, I lost.

01:09:56.150 --> 01:09:58.080
Just a lucky few,

01:09:58.080 --> 01:10:01.050
likes of your husband,
prospered.

01:10:01.050 --> 01:10:03.160
Thinking he was doing
the likes of me a favor.

01:10:05.160 --> 01:10:06.360
So...

01:10:07.360 --> 01:10:08.530
I made my own opportunity.

01:10:10.530 --> 01:10:13.230
Now that requires
investments, still does.

01:10:13.240 --> 01:10:16.140
So I'll be needing your
generosity a while yet.

01:10:19.140 --> 01:10:20.570
You killed my husband.

01:10:20.580 --> 01:10:22.080
He'd have done the same.

01:10:23.080 --> 01:10:24.110
He almost did.

01:10:25.110 --> 01:10:26.850
You took my son.

01:10:26.850 --> 01:10:28.950
He's such a sweet boy,
Charlotte.

01:10:30.950 --> 01:10:33.390
Knows his own mind already.

01:10:33.390 --> 01:10:34.530
You'll see.

01:10:38.530 --> 01:10:39.860
I said...

01:10:41.860 --> 01:10:43.270
Needs more milk.

01:10:52.270 --> 01:10:54.380
You can have Oxfordshire.

01:10:54.380 --> 01:10:57.280
And all the land and the house.

01:10:57.280 --> 01:10:58.280
I know I can.

01:11:00.080 --> 01:11:01.090
Thank you.

01:11:09.090 --> 01:11:12.060
You and your son
could be safe here.

01:11:16.630 --> 01:11:19.470
I just want my son.

01:11:19.470 --> 01:11:20.550
And that's what I'm saying.

01:11:23.540 --> 01:11:24.580
You understand.

01:11:26.580 --> 01:11:28.520
That is what I'm saying.

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.220
Just obey the rules.

01:12:08.220 --> 01:12:09.460
You can go now.

01:13:52.800 --> 01:13:54.360
Charlotte? Shh!

01:13:54.360 --> 01:13:56.470
What in God's name
are you doing?

01:14:05.040 --> 01:14:07.240
Why would you do this?

01:14:07.250 --> 01:14:09.350
Why?
I don't understand.

01:14:09.350 --> 01:14:11.280
Don't you love him?
Of course I do.

01:14:11.280 --> 01:14:12.280
I would die for my son.

01:14:14.580 --> 01:14:16.120
And so you might.

01:14:20.120 --> 01:14:22.780
Why won't you let me see my son?

01:14:42.780 --> 01:14:44.110
Oh.

01:14:44.120 --> 01:14:46.620
This isn't good
for business, darling.

01:14:46.620 --> 01:14:47.820
Not good at all.

01:14:49.820 --> 01:14:51.720
He's a bad man.

01:14:51.720 --> 01:14:54.170
There's a lot of people who owe
their lives to Mr. McCullen.

01:15:00.170 --> 01:15:02.770
Why won't any of you
let me see my son?

01:15:02.770 --> 01:15:05.440
I know nothing about the lad.
But...

01:15:05.440 --> 01:15:07.410
why don't you just
be a good girlie?

01:15:07.410 --> 01:15:10.150
Mind your mouth,
and get back to your work.

01:15:33.800 --> 01:15:37.340
I need your help.
McCullen has my son.

01:15:39.340 --> 01:15:40.900
He killed my husband,
and he has my son.

01:15:41.840 --> 01:15:43.710
Joshua?
<i>Loco!</i>

01:15:43.710 --> 01:15:45.680
I'm not loco, Maria Theresa.

01:15:47.680 --> 01:15:48.880
He has my son.

01:15:48.890 --> 01:15:50.850
Well, I ain't seen
no kid around here.

01:15:50.850 --> 01:15:52.180
He's here in this hotel.

01:15:52.190 --> 01:15:53.590
He's in the room in the corner,

01:15:53.590 --> 01:15:56.590
but McCullen's watching me all
the time so I can't move!

01:15:56.590 --> 01:15:58.460
Unless...

01:15:58.460 --> 01:15:59.460
he knows.

01:16:00.360 --> 01:16:02.200
Please, can you help me?

01:16:02.200 --> 01:16:03.670
Can you help, please?
Can you help me?

01:16:03.670 --> 01:16:05.600
Can you help me get the key?

01:16:05.600 --> 01:16:07.470
The key to what? The key to the rooms.

01:16:07.470 --> 01:16:09.870
You're in there all the time
with the diggers.

01:16:10.870 --> 01:16:12.780
You can help me get to him.

01:16:12.780 --> 01:16:15.740
- And then what would you do?
- I take my son, and I go.

01:16:15.740 --> 01:16:16.840
Yeah, but we stay here.

01:16:16.850 --> 01:16:19.710
- If what you say is right...
- I am right.

01:16:19.710 --> 01:16:21.680
Then they'll know soon enough
that you needed help.

01:16:21.680 --> 01:16:24.390
And it won't be long before
they work out who helped you.

01:16:25.390 --> 01:16:27.460
We live here now, remember?

01:16:27.460 --> 01:16:29.400
We found ourselves
new stories here.

01:16:33.400 --> 01:16:35.610
Please?
Please, please.

01:16:47.610 --> 01:16:49.380
Fred!

01:16:49.380 --> 01:16:51.750
Let's to bed, Fred!

01:18:11.370 --> 01:18:13.380
I like your hair down.

01:19:01.390 --> 01:19:02.690
When I lost my family, I...

01:19:04.690 --> 01:19:06.390
I cursed the heavens.

01:19:09.390 --> 01:19:13.470
When I took your son,
I cursed myself.

01:19:17.470 --> 01:19:19.110
But then I saw you.

01:19:21.110 --> 01:19:22.110
You'd come for him.

01:19:29.080 --> 01:19:30.130
To me.

01:19:49.140 --> 01:19:50.910
You're too beautiful for makeup.

01:20:28.910 --> 01:20:30.870
We all want another's
heartbeat against our own.

01:21:19.630 --> 01:21:23.700
Uh, gentlemen, gentlemen.
We have a very special treat.

01:21:23.700 --> 01:21:26.840
Flamenco and I have prepared
something very special for you.

01:21:57.900 --> 01:22:00.190
I always knew you were
gonna be trouble.

01:22:20.190 --> 01:22:21.860
Jesus Christ.

01:22:36.270 --> 01:22:38.050
Put these on.

01:23:05.740 --> 01:23:07.810
You just don't listen, do you?

01:23:23.060 --> 01:23:24.830
Aah!

01:23:34.300 --> 01:23:36.770
You...

01:23:36.770 --> 01:23:39.210
You gonna die!

01:23:52.280 --> 01:23:53.280
Die, bitch.

01:24:03.730 --> 01:24:05.430
I'm gonna kill you!

01:24:14.710 --> 01:24:17.020
Gonna kill you!

01:24:24.020 --> 01:24:26.020
Oh, you're dead, bitch!

01:24:33.160 --> 01:24:35.300
You can't outrun me!

01:24:42.140 --> 01:24:44.080
Shut up or you're next!

01:24:46.080 --> 01:24:48.310
Where are you, girl?

01:24:49.310 --> 01:24:51.280
What are you looking at?

01:24:53.280 --> 01:24:54.720
I'm gonna find you.

01:24:56.750 --> 01:24:58.160
Think I can't find you?

01:24:59.160 --> 01:25:00.890
You can outrun me?

01:25:01.890 --> 01:25:02.890
Huh?

01:25:04.890 --> 01:25:06.730
Where are you gonna run to, huh?

01:25:07.730 --> 01:25:09.770
All the way back to England?

01:25:14.770 --> 01:25:16.750
I can smell you!

01:25:32.160 --> 01:25:35.230
You think about what's gonna happen
to that little one when you die?

01:25:37.230 --> 01:25:40.430
That's the last thought that's gonna
go through your head, sweetheart.

01:27:39.320 --> 01:27:41.530
Do you have family?

01:27:42.530 --> 01:27:43.630
Once.

01:27:45.630 --> 01:27:48.470
Killed.

01:27:52.470 --> 01:27:54.170
I was fishing.

01:27:55.170 --> 01:27:58.340
They came from the North, and
they killed the whole village.

01:28:00.340 --> 01:28:01.610
The English?

01:28:01.610 --> 01:28:03.280
No.

01:28:03.280 --> 01:28:04.480
Maori.

01:28:05.480 --> 01:28:07.390
Maori with muskets.

01:28:14.390 --> 01:28:15.390
Where will you go?

01:28:17.160 --> 01:28:18.400
Home?

01:28:24.400 --> 01:28:25.990
I don't know.

01:29:30.170 --> 01:29:32.070
It's not really your world,
is it, Charlotte?

01:29:34.070 --> 01:29:35.210
What was it you said?

01:29:37.210 --> 01:29:38.210
Oh, yeah.
That's right.

01:29:39.680 --> 01:29:42.220
You expect everything
to be perfect.

01:29:43.220 --> 01:29:44.500
Well, that's the thing,
isn't it?

01:29:46.260 --> 01:29:47.260
It's not.

01:29:49.760 --> 01:29:52.290
You need protecting
in this world.

01:29:53.290 --> 01:29:54.290
David knew that.

01:29:55.730 --> 01:29:57.470
So do I.

01:29:58.470 --> 01:29:59.710
Come on.

01:30:14.050 --> 01:30:15.220
Put my son down.

01:30:16.220 --> 01:30:17.420
Aw, come on, Charlotte.

01:30:18.420 --> 01:30:21.260
Put... him... down.

01:30:23.260 --> 01:30:26.200
Come on, look.
He's happy in my arms.

01:30:27.200 --> 01:30:29.830
Can't you see?
Look.

01:30:29.830 --> 01:30:32.710
When you came to me... you don't...
you don't think that was destiny?

01:30:34.710 --> 01:30:36.510
Put him down.

01:30:38.510 --> 01:30:40.210
All right.
Tell you what.

01:30:44.210 --> 01:30:46.380
I'm gonna count to three.

01:30:46.380 --> 01:30:47.780
Right?

01:30:47.790 --> 01:30:48.820
Put it down.
Life goes on.

01:30:49.820 --> 01:30:50.820
Please.

01:30:54.590 --> 01:30:55.760
Drop the gun.

01:30:56.760 --> 01:30:57.760
No.

01:30:59.600 --> 01:31:00.600
One.

01:31:01.870 --> 01:31:02.870
I mean it.

01:31:14.780 --> 01:31:15.780
Oh, Charlotte.

01:31:24.760 --> 01:31:25.760
