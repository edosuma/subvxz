WEBVTT

01:29.122 --> 01:32.927
<i>Wake up, Aiden.</i>

01:32.961 --> 01:36.430
<i>I said wake up...</i>

01:40.200 --> 01:41.703
I said wake up, goddamn it!

01:42.971 --> 01:44.005
That's right.

01:44.038 --> 01:45.907
Hey, that's my fucking shit!

01:45.940 --> 01:47.274
You need a warrant
to be in here.

01:47.307 --> 01:48.910
No, we don't need a warrant,
Aiden.

01:48.943 --> 01:51.512
We've got a good old-fashioned
open invitation, kiddo.

01:51.546 --> 01:53.948
- Detective Wall?
- What you got, Burrel?

01:56.416 --> 02:00.253
Look at that. That's a grown-up
bag of coke, young man.

02:00.287 --> 02:02.155
See, I'm a tad out of touch.

02:02.189 --> 02:04.926
Not so sure what the kids
are into much these days.

02:04.959 --> 02:07.194
Why don't you clarify for me?

02:07.227 --> 02:08.596
This here, uh...

02:08.630 --> 02:11.599
this here strictly
for personal consumption?

02:11.633 --> 02:13.333
You dealing, Aiden?

02:13.367 --> 02:15.937
Because in this fine state,
that crime carries with it

02:15.970 --> 02:17.972
-a mandatory minimum--
-Of ten years.

02:18.006 --> 02:20.374
Shit! Ten years!

02:20.407 --> 02:23.343
Goddamn, Aiden,
that's a long time.

02:23.377 --> 02:25.680
Does it look like I have to
waste my time selling?

02:25.713 --> 02:28.248
Hmm, Detective?

02:28.281 --> 02:31.552
Maybe on your salary, but, uh...

02:31.586 --> 02:33.655
I get it now.

02:33.688 --> 02:36.624
You know, maybe you're looking
for a little--

02:36.658 --> 02:39.060
a little something to help
with the kids' college savings.

02:39.093 --> 02:40.928
You watch your mouth, kid.

02:42.295 --> 02:44.231
I'm onto something, right?

02:44.264 --> 02:46.199
How about you guys tell me
what the fuck you want,

02:46.233 --> 02:48.301
so you can leave me
the fuck alone, huh?

02:48.335 --> 02:50.470
Well, if you insist.

02:50.505 --> 02:52.907
- Officer Burrel?
- Yes, sir.

02:52.940 --> 02:55.743
Tag the evidence and take it
down to the car, please.

02:55.777 --> 02:58.311
Come on! You're not
fuckin' serious, right?

02:58.345 --> 03:00.048
Aiden Albers,
you're under arrest.

03:00.081 --> 03:01.883
-Let's-- let's go.
-Fuck you!

03:01.916 --> 03:03.017
Alright, alright.

03:03.051 --> 03:05.687
Get the fuck off of me!

03:05.720 --> 03:07.855
You have the right
to remain silent...

03:07.889 --> 03:09.356
-Anything you say...
-Fuck you!

03:09.389 --> 03:12.593
...can and will be used
against you in a court of law.

03:12.627 --> 03:14.361
You have the right
to an attorney.

03:14.394 --> 03:16.597
Do you understand your rights
as I've described them?

03:16.631 --> 03:17.999
Blow me.

03:18.032 --> 03:20.635
Let's go. Away we go, big guy!

03:20.668 --> 03:21.502
Fuck you!

03:21.536 --> 03:25.707
Alright, Aiden, this way.
This way.

03:25.740 --> 03:27.441
You set this up?

03:27.474 --> 03:29.276
How fucking could you?
I'm your son!

03:29.309 --> 03:32.212
I didn't know what else to do.
Aiden, I'm sorry.

03:32.245 --> 03:35.650
- Mom.
- Let's go. Let's go.

03:35.683 --> 03:37.384
Mom!

03:39.787 --> 03:42.657
Let's go.

03:44.058 --> 03:45.093
Come on, bro.

03:45.126 --> 03:47.461
Burrel! Got a runner.

04:36.144 --> 04:37.545
Hey, Mom. I'm running.

04:37.578 --> 04:39.814
I know. Me too.
I need to be out the door,

04:39.847 --> 04:43.050
but I cannot find
these development specs.
Could you help me find them?

04:43.084 --> 04:46.220
- Help you? Why would I know
where you put your specs?

04:46.254 --> 04:48.288
Oh, here they are.
Okay. I got them.

04:48.321 --> 04:49.657
Um, I got to catch my flight,

04:49.690 --> 04:51.391
but what are you having
for dinner tonight?

04:51.424 --> 04:52.660
<i>I can order you some delivery.</i>

04:52.693 --> 04:54.028
No, I'm fine.
I'll find something.

04:54.061 --> 04:56.329
But what about that burger place
that you love so much?

04:56.363 --> 04:57.698
You know, with the chili fries?

04:57.732 --> 04:59.801
<i>-Mom, I don't eat meat.</i>
-What?

04:59.834 --> 05:01.334
Mom, I'm vegetarian.

05:01.368 --> 05:02.970
Oh, come on, Aiden. Since when?

05:03.004 --> 05:05.907
For, like, years.
Now, look, can I just go run?

05:05.940 --> 05:07.975
Well, just order the fries
without the chili.

05:08.009 --> 05:09.577
-Mom...
<i>-You know what?</i>

05:09.610 --> 05:11.612
You're so precious
about this animal fat,

05:11.646 --> 05:14.381
but you'll put any goddamn thing
into your body.

05:14.414 --> 05:15.650
-What?
<i>-Nothing.</i>

05:15.683 --> 05:18.986
Nothing. Okay. Just... whatever.

05:19.020 --> 05:21.722
Make sure that you have
some dinner. I love you. Okay?

that's why I hate class.

08:21.402 --> 08:22.670
Hey, wait up.

08:22.703 --> 08:26.340
Hey, guys. Hey, uh...
how's it going?

08:26.374 --> 08:28.676
Fast and loose, bro.

08:28.709 --> 08:30.144

08:30.177 --> 08:31.345
Yeah, yeah. Yes, please.

08:35.783 --> 08:37.418
-Thank you.
-Yep.

08:37.451 --> 08:40.988
-Shit really work?
-Oh, I tell you, it's like
you don't need to sleep.

08:41.022 --> 08:43.691
It's great for right now,
you know, with the SATs.

08:43.724 --> 08:46.494
-Yeah, when's yours?
-Eighteenth.

08:46.527 --> 08:48.729
But they're all on Saturdays.

08:48.763 --> 08:50.631
Stress, you know.
Blanking on the dates.

08:50.664 --> 08:52.133
Yeah, yeah. Exactly.

08:52.166 --> 08:54.235
-Alright, man, have a good one.
-Oh, wait, wait. Um...

08:54.268 --> 08:56.570
I heard you guys were having
this party... tonight?

08:56.604 --> 08:57.938
-Heard that, huh?
-Heard right.

08:57.972 --> 09:00.141
Party of the decade.
You gonna be there?

09:00.174 --> 09:01.375
Yeah. Yeah, totally.

09:01.409 --> 09:03.044
Don't come.

09:03.077 --> 09:04.278
No.

09:04.311 --> 09:06.447
You're not invited.

09:06.480 --> 09:08.149
Just fucking with you.

09:08.182 --> 09:10.785
We're fucking with you!
Ha ha ha! Got you.

09:10.818 --> 09:12.486
Obviously, man,
show up, alright?

09:12.521 --> 09:14.055
Okay, great.
I'll spread the word.

09:14.088 --> 09:15.389
-Don't do that.
-O-okay.

09:15.423 --> 09:17.091
-Hey, kiddo, kiddo, kiddo.
-Sorry. Sorry.

09:17.124 --> 09:18.759
-What you want?
-Um...

09:18.793 --> 09:21.562
I was hoping to maybe
get some weed from you guys.

09:21.595 --> 09:22.930
-Some weed?
-How old are you?

09:22.963 --> 09:24.732
-I'm 14.
-Get the fuck out of here.

09:24.765 --> 09:26.367
-I'm not selling to you.
-What?

09:26.400 --> 09:28.369
Come back when you're older.

09:28.402 --> 09:29.470
Seriously?

09:29.504 --> 09:30.771
-I said scram.
-Aiden, Aiden.

09:30.805 --> 09:32.406
No, no, no.
Get the fuck outta here.

09:32.440 --> 09:33.574
Scram!

09:33.607 --> 09:35.209
Thanks. Okay.

09:35.242 --> 09:38.012
He'll thank me later.

09:38.045 --> 09:40.948
Jesus, getting
younger and younger, bro.

09:40.981 --> 09:42.850
Just a kid.

09:42.883 --> 09:45.352
Look at this,
the ladies have arrived.

09:45.386 --> 09:50.191
What up, what up?
What's up, Gs? Aiden.

09:50.224 --> 09:51.392
Nice car.

09:51.425 --> 09:53.562
-Shit brand-new?
-Yeah, pretty much.

09:53.594 --> 09:56.664
Damn,
Mommy's got you covered, huh?

09:56.697 --> 09:57.865
Must be nice, eh, Mike?

09:57.898 --> 09:59.568
Yeah. It's not bad for an SUV.

09:59.600 --> 10:01.402
I would've went with the coupe.

10:01.435 --> 10:02.636
Got a problem, Caleb?

10:02.670 --> 10:05.206
Oh, I got all kinds of problems,
Aiden.

10:05.239 --> 10:06.740
Do <i>you </i> have a problem?

10:08.375 --> 10:11.212
-Maybe just one.
-Alright, alright.
Cool out with all this bullshit.

10:11.245 --> 10:13.747
Yeah, yeah, we're cool.
Just remember why we're here.

10:13.781 --> 10:16.083
So, y'all want something,
or what?

10:16.117 --> 10:18.085
Heard you guys got
that gym candy.

10:18.119 --> 10:20.221
-You serious, bro?
-Did he fuckin' stutter?

10:20.254 --> 10:21.422
Yeah, he's serious.

10:21.455 --> 10:24.492
-Get the fuck outta here.
-Nice.

10:24.526 --> 10:25.960
What's the matter, bro?

10:25.993 --> 10:27.661
What, my girlfriend's
good enough for you,

10:27.695 --> 10:29.130
but my money isn't?

10:29.163 --> 10:31.566
The first right thing he said
all fuckin' day.

10:31.600 --> 10:34.569
-He's hurt.
-He's definitely hurt.
-He's hurt. He's hurt.

10:34.603 --> 10:37.506
Look, man, I don't even know
where to begin to get that shit,
to be honest.

10:37.539 --> 10:41.709
I'm sure you guys can find it.
You, uh... know where all that
black market shit is, right?

10:41.742 --> 10:44.478
How about you guys take
a fuckin' walk?

10:44.513 --> 10:46.213
Hmm?

10:47.481 --> 10:49.717
Relax, man. Alright?

10:49.750 --> 10:53.254
I'm gonna work on it.
-No fuckin' promises, though.
-There you go.

10:53.287 --> 10:55.456
I love the initiative, Brian.

10:55.489 --> 10:57.358
See you ladies tonight.

10:57.391 --> 10:58.859
Blake.

10:58.893 --> 11:00.227
Hey, Aiden...

11:01.962 --> 11:05.232
you better get that shit for us.

11:10.104 --> 11:13.340
You're actually gonna go to LL
with that shit for Caleb?

11:13.374 --> 11:14.909
Why not?

11:14.942 --> 11:16.343
Steroids, Blake? Come on.

11:16.377 --> 11:20.114
Oh, now you want to get
all high and mighty on me?

11:23.717 --> 11:25.753
Let's invite him to the party.

11:27.087 --> 11:29.023
-Who?
-LL.

11:29.056 --> 11:31.125
-Get the fuck outta here.
-I'm serious, man.

11:31.158 --> 11:34.461
Yeah, yeah, yeah. You want
Local Legend at your house?

11:34.495 --> 11:35.930
I been making him money
for months.

11:35.963 --> 11:37.599
About time I meet him, right?

11:40.901 --> 11:41.969
No.

11:42.002 --> 11:43.771
I've been making him money.

11:43.804 --> 11:46.140
You've been watching
my back, okay?

11:46.173 --> 11:48.943
So, let's-- let's get that
straight. Alright?

11:48.976 --> 11:52.246
I see how it is. So...

11:52.279 --> 11:54.915
I'm good enough
to watch your back,
but not meet your boy.

11:54.949 --> 11:56.585
-That's what it is, right?
-No, no.

11:56.618 --> 11:57.818
That's not it,
and you know that.

11:57.851 --> 11:59.654
So, what the fuck is it, then?

11:59.688 --> 12:01.422
Come on, you know
this shit's gonna be lit.

12:01.455 --> 12:02.923
The whole fucking school's
coming.

12:02.957 --> 12:04.559
He'll see what we bring
to the table.

12:04.593 --> 12:06.493
He'll see where the fuck
you live, man.

12:06.528 --> 12:07.629
Blake.

12:07.662 --> 12:10.931
Come on. Just make the ask.

12:10.965 --> 12:12.266
Let's see what happens.

12:15.402 --> 12:16.804
It's a bad fucking idea.

12:16.837 --> 12:18.439
There you go.

12:18.472 --> 12:20.307
Just have a little faith, bro.

12:25.012 --> 12:26.780
<i>How we looking for tonight?</i>

12:26.814 --> 12:30.284
Blake reached out to him,
so we'll see if he bites.

12:31.819 --> 12:33.622
Listen, I'm just--
Are you sure that we can--

12:33.655 --> 12:35.356
<i>I'll get the wheels turning.</i>

12:35.389 --> 12:36.591
<i>Keep me updated.</i>

12:36.625 --> 12:38.292
<i>Same place and time.</i>

12:38.325 --> 12:39.426
<i>Don't be late.</i>

12:39.460 --> 12:41.161
<i>And stay calm.</i>

12:43.130 --> 12:44.532
Yeah, I got it.

12:59.681 --> 13:01.750
-That was the kid?
-Yeah.

13:01.782 --> 13:03.183
Yeah.

13:03.217 --> 13:04.918
SWAT's not gonna like
the scramble

13:04.952 --> 13:06.554
this late in the game.

13:06.588 --> 13:11.058
For this, they'll make it work.

13:11.091 --> 13:13.394
What do you think's gonna happen
to the kid?

13:13.427 --> 13:14.729
We'll see.

13:14.763 --> 13:16.263
I mean, that's above
our paygrades.

13:16.297 --> 13:18.966
What, you--

13:18.999 --> 13:21.068
You feeling guilty?

13:21.101 --> 13:24.405
Maybe a little, yeah. I am.

13:24.438 --> 13:26.006
You know what?

13:26.040 --> 13:28.342
I'll be goddamned.
I think you're right on this.

13:28.375 --> 13:29.611
Let's call it off.

13:29.644 --> 13:32.514
I don't want you
losing sleep over this.

13:32.547 --> 13:34.749
You can tell the captain...

13:34.783 --> 13:38.352
Well, you can tell the captain
that we decided
to listen to our hearts.

13:38.385 --> 13:41.523
-Of course.
-But, no, you're right.
You're right.

13:41.556 --> 13:45.492
Let's turn our backs
on the biggest potential bust
this department has seen

13:45.527 --> 13:46.795
in over a decade,

13:46.827 --> 13:50.130
because you felt guilty...
over a boy.

13:50.164 --> 13:56.203
A pathetic, contribution-less,
opportunity-wasting boy,

13:56.236 --> 13:58.773
who, by the way,
happens to be far older

13:58.807 --> 14:00.140
than plenty of other kids

14:00.174 --> 14:01.975
that have been pinched
for the same crime,

14:02.009 --> 14:05.012
who have no safety net
whatsoever.

14:05.814 --> 14:07.816
But you tell me...

14:07.848 --> 14:13.287
should we go on over
and talk to the captain now?

14:13.320 --> 14:14.355
No, sir.

14:14.388 --> 14:16.090
Why don't we circle back

14:16.123 --> 14:19.893
to this little pow-wow
after the operation,

14:19.927 --> 14:21.962
and depending on how things go,

14:21.995 --> 14:24.131
I'll have a talk
with the captain

14:24.164 --> 14:27.267
about bumping you up
to detective?

14:36.009 --> 14:38.580
Thank you, sir.

14:38.613 --> 14:40.381
Don't mention it.

14:45.285 --> 14:47.287
Fuckin' asshole.

15:19.987 --> 15:22.322
Wow.
That's lots of booze.

15:22.356 --> 15:24.091
What are you having,
like a baptism,

15:24.124 --> 15:26.661
a funeral, a wedding?

15:26.694 --> 15:29.263
-It's just a party.
-You must be a popular guy.

15:29.296 --> 15:30.998
You got ID?

15:34.435 --> 15:37.171
Hmm. You got another ID?

15:41.576 --> 15:43.711
Yep, that works.

15:43.745 --> 15:44.846
Anything else?

15:44.879 --> 15:46.013
Um...

15:46.046 --> 15:49.483
Yeah, let me get
two Spirits and...

15:49.517 --> 15:51.185
let me get one of those.

15:57.458 --> 15:58.626

You didn't go to class, Aiden.

19:20.995 --> 19:23.097
So, no practice.

19:23.131 --> 19:25.133
My grandmother's

Look, I'm sure you've got
a great excuse.

27:59.980 --> 28:01.482
It's for your magic tricks,

28:01.516 --> 28:04.485
so you have someplace special
and safe to keep them.

28:04.519 --> 28:06.655
I love it.

28:06.687 --> 28:08.756
Happy birthday.
I love you.

28:11.492 --> 28:13.160
I'm so fucking out of here.

28:53.968 --> 28:55.369
Aiden.

29:00.274 --> 29:01.775
Aiden...

29:03.712 --> 29:05.614
Aiden!

29:05.647 --> 29:07.047
Wha--

30:02.836 --> 30:04.305
Think of it as a game.

30:05.573 --> 30:07.141
It's not a game.

30:07.174 --> 30:11.312
Ah... It's like a session
with my shrink.

30:11.345 --> 30:13.347
We're vision questing here.

30:13.380 --> 30:15.316
-Mm-hmm.
-Mm-hmm.

30:15.349 --> 30:17.151
Okay, you start.

30:17.184 --> 30:19.320
I will, then.

30:19.353 --> 30:23.190
In two years,
I'm onstage at Tisch,

30:23.223 --> 30:26.093
receiving a standing ovation
for a small but pivotal role

30:26.126 --> 30:28.630
in a recent Tennessee Williams
production.

30:28.663 --> 30:29.930
Mm-hmm. Wow.

30:29.963 --> 30:32.399
-In five years--
-W-w-w-wait.

30:32.433 --> 30:34.703
So...

30:34.736 --> 30:36.638
you want to be an actor?

30:36.671 --> 30:38.172
Yeah...

30:38.205 --> 30:40.709
Walk in someone else's shoes.

30:40.742 --> 30:42.242
In five years,

30:42.276 --> 30:44.612
I'm bartending at a hole
in the wall in the Village,

30:44.646 --> 30:46.046
when I get a text
from my manager

30:46.080 --> 30:49.183
that I've landed
my first major film role.

30:49.216 --> 30:52.821
Mm-hmm. And in ten years,
I am nominated for an Oscar,

30:52.853 --> 30:54.823
which I don't win,
because Meryl is nominated,

30:54.855 --> 30:56.857
but that's totally fine,

30:56.890 --> 30:58.892
because at Elton John's party,

30:58.926 --> 31:01.161
she hugs me
and says she loves me.

31:01.195 --> 31:03.330
And nothing else matters.

31:50.244 --> 31:51.979
Come on.

31:56.950 --> 31:58.419
Tip-fuckin'-top.

31:58.452 --> 32:00.622
I don't even think you know
that I love you.

32:00.655 --> 32:04.024
<i>You see, I got you</i>
<i>on tape, Aiden Albers,</i>

32:04.057 --> 32:06.960
and that shit does not go away.

32:09.396 --> 32:11.064
You.

32:49.269 --> 32:51.004
What are you, uh...
What are you doing here?

32:51.038 --> 32:53.407
"Hi, Mom. How are ya?"

32:54.542 --> 32:55.877
I live here too.

32:55.910 --> 32:58.746
-I left my passport. Um...
-Yeah?

32:58.780 --> 33:00.447
Why are you sweating?

33:00.481 --> 33:01.616
Oh, uh...

33:01.649 --> 33:04.084
Just-- I actually had
track practice, so,

33:04.117 --> 33:06.220
you know, didn't shower yet.

33:06.253 --> 33:08.422
So stupid to forget my passport.

33:08.455 --> 33:10.725
You want me to make you
something to go
like a snack or...

33:10.758 --> 33:12.527
I'll grab something on my way.

33:15.597 --> 33:17.565
Okay.

33:23.036 --> 33:25.339
-What's going on?
-Mom, don't do this.

33:25.372 --> 33:27.207
Look at me.

33:27.241 --> 33:29.711
Don't touch me like that.

33:32.012 --> 33:35.048
I'm sorry. I had to ask.

33:35.082 --> 33:38.018
-Yeah, whatever.
-Are you on something?

33:38.051 --> 33:40.220
Jesus fucking Christ, Mom.

33:40.254 --> 33:42.055
You don't look like
you're sleeping well.

33:42.089 --> 33:44.091
You look worn out.

33:49.864 --> 33:51.365
Would you stop asking me
these questions,

33:51.398 --> 33:53.267
like there's something wrong
with me?

33:53.300 --> 33:55.637
Please.

33:55.670 --> 33:58.071
Well, I'm sorry for being
a concerned mother

33:58.105 --> 34:02.610
when her son is never home,
out-- doing--

34:02.644 --> 34:03.945
Out doing what?

34:03.978 --> 34:09.717
No, tell me what it is
you think I'm doing out there.
Tell me!

34:09.751 --> 34:12.319
You know what?

34:12.352 --> 34:14.522
I'm so tired
of you yelling at me.

34:16.189 --> 34:18.760
I don't know.
That's the problem.

34:18.793 --> 34:21.161
So, how about you ask me a real
fucking question, then, huh?

34:21.194 --> 34:23.230
I don't think you want me
to ask you a real question.

34:23.263 --> 34:25.432
What is it you're dying to know?
'Cause it sure is better

34:25.465 --> 34:27.434
than you calling the cops
on your own fucking son--!

34:27.467 --> 34:30.170
You were out of control,
and I had no choice!

34:30.203 --> 34:32.372
-You had no choice?
-No, I did not have a choice.

34:32.406 --> 34:33.808
-No fucking choice?
-Yeah.

34:33.841 --> 34:35.142
-Where's my choice?
-Because--

34:35.175 --> 34:37.177
-Where is mine, huh?
-Stop yelling at me.

34:37.210 --> 34:39.581
Maybe if you just trusted me,
just a little fucking bit.

34:39.614 --> 34:42.282
Because that has worked
so well for us, Aiden?

34:42.316 --> 34:43.618
I mean, I cannot even keep track

34:43.651 --> 34:45.485
of how many times
you have lied to me

34:45.520 --> 34:48.923
or stolen from me
or raided my medicine cabinet.

34:48.957 --> 34:50.959
I have given you everything!

34:50.992 --> 34:54.361
And I am here by myself--

34:54.394 --> 34:55.630
Fuck!

34:55.663 --> 34:57.230
Okay?

34:57.264 --> 34:58.800
And if it is not good enough
for you,

34:58.833 --> 35:00.167
then the hell with you.

35:37.705 --> 35:39.439
I'm sorry.

35:43.143 --> 35:45.847
I'm really stressed out.

35:45.880 --> 35:47.115
I didn't mean that.

35:47.147 --> 35:48.616
-Yeah, you did.
-No.

35:48.650 --> 35:51.385
No, I didn't.
I really didn't mean that.

35:54.789 --> 35:56.924
You know what the worst part is?

36:01.029 --> 36:03.698
It's that you don't even know
who I am.

36:03.731 --> 36:06.266
Aiden...

36:08.168 --> 36:10.838
Please, just go.

36:22.583 --> 36:26.087
Well, just promise me that we're
gonna talk when I get back.

36:26.120 --> 36:29.757
I didn't expect
to walk into this shit anyway.

36:29.791 --> 36:31.926
What up, playa?!

36:31.959 --> 36:33.961
Let's light this bitch up, man!

36:33.995 --> 36:36.196
Pre-game in full session!

36:36.229 --> 36:39.299
Ooh, sh--

36:39.332 --> 36:42.837
Hey, Mrs. Albers.
How are you doin'?

36:42.870 --> 36:45.106
I'm sorry, "pre-game"?

36:45.139 --> 36:46.206
It's not even like that.

36:46.239 --> 36:47.775
No, no, no, no.

36:47.809 --> 36:49.476
He, um...

36:49.510 --> 36:51.646
The thing is, Blake's girl
just called it quits with him,

36:51.679 --> 36:53.648
so--so, I figured
I'd invite him over,

36:53.681 --> 36:57.518
I-- I'd-- You know,
we'd chill by the pool,
we'd play some games.

36:57.552 --> 36:59.087
It's just--
It's just whatever, right?

36:59.120 --> 37:00.487
That's right.
That's right. Yeah.

37:00.521 --> 37:02.623
I'm-- I'm really depressed
right now.

37:02.657 --> 37:03.991
You're depressed?

37:04.025 --> 37:05.693
Yeah, it's serious, you know?

37:05.727 --> 37:07.929
I found out I'm not as gifted
as I thought I was,

37:07.962 --> 37:09.197
if you know what I mean.

37:09.229 --> 37:12.700
I'm going to talk to you
when I get back.

37:13.901 --> 37:16.170
I'm choosing to trust you.

37:16.204 --> 37:18.506
Yeah, I...

37:18.539 --> 37:19.874
Bye.

37:21.542 --> 37:24.444
-Stay out of trouble.
-Yeah.

37:29.517 --> 37:31.052
Shit! Did I miss something?

37:31.085 --> 37:32.887
What'd I miss?

37:32.920 --> 37:34.321
What happened?

37:36.557 --> 37:38.626
You're slow as fuck.
You know that, right?

37:40.561 --> 37:41.929
That's funny, 'cause, uh...

Liz said the same shit

We have some time.

42:16.404 --> 42:17.872

-Look, Wall...
-Anticipation.

even for a second, by something
so small as a bread crumb,

42:40.628 --> 42:42.563
I could snap its little neck

42:42.596 --> 42:44.965
before it ever knew
what happened to him.

42:50.237 --> 42:52.873
Look...

42:52.907 --> 42:55.409
I know there's a lot riding
on our shoulders tonight.

42:55.443 --> 42:58.779
"Our" shoulders?
Yours are looking pretty light
from where I'm sitting.

42:58.813 --> 43:00.281
I'm the one with my neck out.

43:00.314 --> 43:01.615
You're wrong, Aiden.

43:01.649 --> 43:03.984
It's both our necks.

43:04.018 --> 43:05.653
But us...

43:05.686 --> 43:09.757
we're just two tiny drops
in a big ocean.

43:11.526 --> 43:16.565
You help me bring down this--
this piece of shit tonight,

43:16.597 --> 43:17.898
and we get one step closer

43:17.932 --> 43:22.703
to taking down
the entire operation.

43:22.736 --> 43:24.672
I won't have your behavior
get in the way of that.

43:24.705 --> 43:26.740
-Fine.
-I won't.

43:26.774 --> 43:28.609
Alright, these are my people.
I know what to do.

43:28.642 --> 43:30.111
Your "people," Aiden?

43:30.144 --> 43:33.013
Aiden, these people are
drains on society,

43:33.047 --> 43:35.649
scumbags not worth
another thought.

43:35.683 --> 43:38.752
You? You could still
do something with your life,

43:38.786 --> 43:41.590
have a real future.

43:41.622 --> 43:43.390
But tonight?

43:43.424 --> 43:46.827
Tonight, you're helping make
this world a safer place.

43:49.196 --> 43:50.998
And that's what matters.

43:55.469 --> 43:58.507
Good talk. Update you later.

43:58.540 --> 44:00.174
I'll be listening.

44:03.410 --> 44:05.079
Take care, kid.

44:16.525 --> 44:18.959
Hey there, pal.

44:18.993 --> 44:21.462
Sounds like you're having fun
in here.

44:21.495 --> 44:23.998
I want my lawyer.

44:24.031 --> 44:27.801
Guilty people want lawyers.

44:27.835 --> 44:29.504
You guilty, Aiden?

44:29.538 --> 44:30.971
Ha ha, funny, funny,
funny, funny.

44:31.005 --> 44:32.740
Where'd you get that from?
CSI, huh?

44:32.773 --> 44:34.041
You're right.

44:34.074 --> 44:35.142
That is funny,

44:35.176 --> 44:38.379
considering I got your ass
ten times over.

44:40.080 --> 44:42.183
This morning...

44:42.216 --> 44:43.751
this morning was a...

44:43.784 --> 44:45.654
was a favor.

44:45.686 --> 44:48.756
Answering your cry for help.

44:48.789 --> 44:51.959
You took that favor,
and you spit on it.

44:51.992 --> 44:54.228
We're just getting started,
you piece of fucking shit.

44:54.261 --> 44:56.063
Oh, you sure are right
about that, kiddo.

44:56.096 --> 44:58.499
You think the coke
looks bad today? Huh?

44:58.533 --> 44:59.634
See, you got nothing.

44:59.668 --> 45:01.735
Yeah, I got you on tape,

45:01.769 --> 45:02.836
Aiden Albers.

45:02.870 --> 45:05.773
And that shit does not go away,

45:05.806 --> 45:08.643
no matter how much money
you think you can throw at it.

45:08.677 --> 45:11.445
Bullshit.

45:11.478 --> 45:15.783
Your momma came in here today.
You believe that shit?

45:15.816 --> 45:19.253
Begging me to scare
some sense into you.

45:19.286 --> 45:20.921
Keep you out of prison,

45:20.955 --> 45:23.123
away from your junkie friends.

45:23.157 --> 45:27.394
Now, did I tell her
that I have you on tape,

45:27.428 --> 45:28.462
buying drugs--

45:28.495 --> 45:29.664
Quit fucking playing, man.

45:29.698 --> 45:32.733
...on three separate occasions?

45:32.766 --> 45:34.301
You see, Aiden,

45:34.335 --> 45:38.072
before today, you weren't worth
the fucking paperwork.

45:38.105 --> 45:41.643
Spoiled little rich kid
wants to fuck up his life?

45:41.676 --> 45:44.713
That's on him.
Who gives a rat's ass?

45:44.745 --> 45:46.146
But after you decided to open

45:46.180 --> 45:48.415
that pretty little mouth
of yours,

45:48.449 --> 45:53.254
I figured, "Hell, let me
double-check those tapes."

45:53.287 --> 45:54.689
And it turns out

45:54.723 --> 45:57.559
there was a fourth occasion.

45:57.592 --> 45:59.628
And on said occasion,

45:59.661 --> 46:01.962
you weren't just buying
for yourself.

46:01.996 --> 46:03.632
In fact,

46:03.665 --> 46:05.332
you even bragged about it.

46:07.401 --> 46:09.537
Now, that changes everything.

46:11.839 --> 46:16.076
You see, Aiden...

46:20.314 --> 46:22.249
I own you.

46:22.283 --> 46:25.853
You fuck, you waste.

46:25.886 --> 46:29.758
And you're gonna do
exactly what I ask of you,

46:29.823 --> 46:31.325
because, right now,

46:31.358 --> 46:34.295
your future's
looking pretty fucking dark.

46:35.462 --> 46:38.499
And if you ever want to see
the light again,

46:38.533 --> 46:41.468
it's gonna be me
leading you to it.

46:41.502 --> 46:43.404
You can't fucking do this.

46:43.437 --> 46:44.872
I'm doing it.

46:44.905 --> 46:46.940
I'm done, actually.

46:49.843 --> 46:54.081
You can either be tried
as an adult

46:54.114 --> 46:57.351
or we can wipe the slate clean.

46:57.384 --> 46:59.086
Up to you, kiddo.

47:04.858 --> 47:06.327
What do you want?

47:12.466 --> 47:15.202
Oh, just, uh...

47:15.235 --> 47:17.037
everyone.

47:40.160 --> 47:42.162
Oh, look at this guy
right here!

47:42.196 --> 47:44.231
Hey, buddy!

47:44.264 --> 47:47.769
- You need a ride?
- I'm good.
-Yeah, you're good.

47:47.802 --> 47:50.471
That's why you're gonna
come up with
what we talked about, right?

47:50.505 --> 47:53.173
Yeah, get us that juice, dawg.
We're trying to win state's!

47:53.207 --> 47:54.241
Of course.

47:54.274 --> 47:57.411
Ooh, I can feel that burn.
You're the fucking man.

47:57.444 --> 47:59.647
I'm so happy I don't
have to break your face.

47:59.681 --> 48:02.082
-You got it.
-Stay up, kid.

48:02.116 --> 48:06.053
You be safe out there
on these streets, okay, G?

48:38.653 --> 48:40.020
Aiden.

48:42.055 --> 48:45.325
I'm sorry about earlier.
I don't...

48:45.359 --> 48:47.862
I don't really know
what that was.

48:47.896 --> 48:50.164
I haven't seen you in months.

48:50.197 --> 48:53.802
And then just out of nowhere,
and you just take off like that?

48:53.835 --> 48:56.538
I, uh...
I wanted to say hello...

48:59.373 --> 49:01.175
I wanted to, uh...

49:02.844 --> 49:05.713
I know that I'm probably
the last person

49:05.747 --> 49:08.516
you want to hear from.

49:08.550 --> 49:09.717
And, uh...

49:09.751 --> 49:11.853
And what I...

49:11.886 --> 49:14.221
what I did
can never be forgiven...

49:15.489 --> 49:17.024
but, um...

49:19.393 --> 49:22.262
I guess I just really wanted
to see her.

49:22.296 --> 49:24.231
You know, I really miss her.

49:26.935 --> 49:28.703
She's different now.

49:29.970 --> 49:31.573
You know that, right?

49:33.942 --> 49:35.743
She's still her.

49:50.725 --> 49:52.259
Come here.

50:23.892 --> 50:25.492
Aiden.

50:26.460 --> 50:28.428
Layla... wow.

50:29.564 --> 50:31.498
Where have you been?

50:31.533 --> 50:33.701
I've, uh...

50:33.735 --> 50:35.302
made a bad choice.

50:36.871 --> 50:38.840
Apology accepted.

50:38.873 --> 50:41.576
Come on.

50:41.609 --> 50:43.310
I-- I'm glad you're here.

50:43.343 --> 50:44.646
I--

50:44.679 --> 50:47.682
I want to play, and there's
nobody to play with.

50:47.715 --> 50:50.785
Mommy's too busy.

50:50.818 --> 50:52.987
Sure. What do you want to play?

50:53.021 --> 50:55.222
Come see.

50:56.991 --> 51:00.762
This game is called "Someday."

51:02.462 --> 51:06.333
This is Mommy,
and this is Daddy.

51:06.366 --> 51:08.268
They're married,
and they love each other.

51:08.302 --> 51:12.674
They're mommy and daddy
to a little girl named Rose.

51:12.707 --> 51:15.475
She's two and never, ever cries.

51:15.510 --> 51:17.210
She's very brave,

51:17.244 --> 51:19.547
even at night,
when you shut the lights.

51:19.581 --> 51:22.449
Now, that is super brave.

51:25.820 --> 51:29.256
So... So, what do I do?

51:30.525 --> 51:33.661
Aiden, this is Someday.
We can do whatever we want.

51:33.695 --> 51:35.295
We're the mommy and daddy.

51:35.329 --> 51:37.699
Right.

51:38.700 --> 51:41.903
Um, first, you come home,

51:41.936 --> 51:43.838
from work.

51:43.871 --> 51:45.339
A long day at the office.

51:45.372 --> 51:48.776
And... and you work so hard...

51:48.810 --> 51:50.778
taking care of the family.

52:00.454 --> 52:02.690
Layla, I can't--
I can't play today.

52:04.358 --> 52:07.361
I'm gonna have to go away
for a while.

52:07.394 --> 52:08.495
What?

52:12.567 --> 52:16.004
I wanted to tell you myself,
'cause...

52:16.037 --> 52:18.238
'cause you might not see me
much more.

52:19.607 --> 52:20.908
No...

52:20.942 --> 52:22.677
I don't want to,
but I think I have to.

52:22.710 --> 52:25.913
-I think it's the only way--
-You don't-- you don't have
to go anywhere.

52:25.947 --> 52:29.449
You just don't want
to play with me.

52:29.483 --> 52:31.119
No, that's not true, Layla.

52:31.151 --> 52:33.121
So, why?

52:33.153 --> 52:34.589
Where are you going?

52:34.622 --> 52:35.790
When?

52:35.823 --> 52:37.725
I don't know. I--

52:37.759 --> 52:39.594
Soon. Maybe tonight.

52:39.627 --> 52:40.828
No!

52:40.862 --> 52:42.429
No...!

52:44.732 --> 52:46.500
I need you to know

52:46.534 --> 52:49.369
that I care about you
so, so much.

52:49.403 --> 52:51.739
If you cared,
you would stay with me.

52:51.773 --> 52:55.409
Stay and play Someday!

53:03.017 --> 53:04.652
Layla, please.

53:07.387 --> 53:08.923
Please don't cry.

53:08.956 --> 53:11.391
This is the worst day ever.

53:40.088 --> 53:41.923
I'm sorry.

55:11.078 --> 55:15.149
In 15 years, I'm celebrating
my Golden Globe win

55:15.183 --> 55:16.717
and the cover
of "People" magazine

55:16.751 --> 55:19.187
with a week at a private resort
in the Maldives

55:19.220 --> 55:20.621
with husband number one,

55:20.655 --> 55:24.258
who may or may not be you.

55:24.292 --> 55:27.360
You getting how this works?

55:29.163 --> 55:31.098
-Mm-hmm.
-Yeah, well, it's...

55:32.967 --> 55:35.303
I guess it's easy when you've
got it all figured out, huh?

55:35.335 --> 55:37.038
Well, just start.

55:37.071 --> 55:40.241
Dig in.
Like, what's your picture?

55:40.274 --> 55:42.510
-I don't have one.
-Aiden, this is Someday.

55:42.543 --> 55:47.582
I'm serious. I've...
You know, I've always just taken
one step in front of the other.

55:47.615 --> 55:50.151
I don't...
I haven't thought about it.

55:50.184 --> 55:51.819
I don't know what I want.

55:51.853 --> 55:55.455
Because you don't take the time
to ask yourself.

55:57.390 --> 55:58.659
Hmm?

55:58.693 --> 56:00.328
Okay.

56:00.360 --> 56:02.630
-But don't laugh.
-Mm-mm.

56:04.298 --> 56:05.800
I might want to be a poet.

56:05.833 --> 56:07.535
A poet?

56:07.568 --> 56:10.738
- I told you, don't laugh.
- I'm not laughing.

56:10.771 --> 56:12.039
Yeah, I mean, think about it.

56:12.073 --> 56:13.440
-It's--
-Okay.

56:15.610 --> 56:17.912
You start off with something
you can't touch...

56:17.945 --> 56:19.580
Mm-hmm.

56:19.614 --> 56:21.849
...or really see, but it's--
it's something you feel.

56:21.883 --> 56:25.119
It's real. Right?

56:25.152 --> 56:27.655
And every decision you take,

56:27.688 --> 56:31.025
whether big or small, it's--
I mean-- they're yours.

56:31.058 --> 56:32.560
And, sure, you might suck,

56:32.593 --> 56:37.031
and-- and might not reach
their expectations, but...

56:37.064 --> 56:39.033
but at the end of it,
at the end of the day,

56:39.066 --> 56:40.467
it's-- it's--

56:40.500 --> 56:43.938
it's touchable,
it's seeable, it's--

56:43.971 --> 56:45.873
it's you.

56:45.907 --> 56:47.440
It is you.

56:47.474 --> 56:49.110
It's beautiful.

56:50.443 --> 56:52.046
Stop.

56:52.079 --> 56:54.515
Hey, it's...

56:54.548 --> 56:56.584
Ah, it's whatever. It's...

56:56.617 --> 56:59.820
You know...
they're just dreams, right?

56:59.854 --> 57:01.022
It's...

57:04.325 --> 57:06.527
It's never gonna happen anyways.

57:08.296 --> 57:10.531
Sometimes...

57:10.564 --> 57:12.600
I feel like I know you.

57:12.633 --> 57:16.570
But then, sometimes,
I have no idea who you are.

57:16.604 --> 57:18.172
Let's try this new stuff.

57:18.205 --> 57:20.440
Okay.

57:23.210 --> 57:24.645
I look at you, and...

57:24.679 --> 57:26.747
I don't even think you know
that I love you.

57:42.730 --> 57:45.366
Layla, I...

57:45.399 --> 57:46.867
Layla?

57:46.901 --> 57:48.636
Layla? Layla!

57:52.506 --> 57:55.042
Help! I need help!

57:57.878 --> 58:00.948
It's okay. It's okay.

59:32.139 --> 59:35.009
How could you give her
that synthetic shit?

59:35.042 --> 59:36.343
It's poison.

1:00:07.241 --> 1:00:08.909
Hey, bae.

1:00:08.943 --> 1:00:10.211
We early?

1:00:10.244 --> 1:00:11.580
Nah, perfect timing. Come on in.

1:00:11.612 --> 1:00:13.614
You look like shit, Aiden.

1:00:13.647 --> 1:00:15.282
Holy shit.

1:00:15.316 --> 1:00:17.351
Your house is amazing.

1:00:17.384 --> 1:00:19.720
-Let's do shots.
-Yes!

1:00:19.753 --> 1:00:21.288
Why don't you guys have a...

1:00:21.322 --> 1:00:23.691
just have a look around,
and I'll be right back.

1:00:23.724 --> 1:00:24.992
I'll keep you company.

1:00:25.025 --> 1:00:27.328
Holy shit!

1:00:27.361 --> 1:00:28.662
Look at these lights!

1:00:28.696 --> 1:00:30.131
Can you even believe this?

1:00:30.164 --> 1:00:32.133
Oh, my gosh.

1:00:32.166 --> 1:00:33.934
Is that a TV?

1:00:33.968 --> 1:00:35.736
Oh, my God, look. King hot tub.

1:00:35.769 --> 1:00:37.404
-Oh, my gosh.
-Oh, shit.

1:00:41.275 --> 1:00:42.843
Give me a second.

1:00:57.291 --> 1:01:01.128
So, I got good news.

1:01:01.162 --> 1:01:02.564
Yeah?

1:01:02.597 --> 1:01:04.865
Early admission to Cal State.

1:01:04.899 --> 1:01:07.034
And I got the scholarship.

1:01:14.441 --> 1:01:16.645
Aiden?

1:01:16.677 --> 1:01:18.846
Did you hear me?

1:01:21.015 --> 1:01:23.751
That's, um...
that's incredible, Liz.

1:01:23.784 --> 1:01:26.387
That's... that's so amazing.

1:01:26.420 --> 1:01:27.656
It's actually happening.

1:01:27.688 --> 1:01:29.056
And in the letter, they said

1:01:29.089 --> 1:01:31.959
I was a good candidate
for work study too.

1:01:31.992 --> 1:01:33.662
It's real, bae.

1:01:33.694 --> 1:01:36.163
I actually did it.

1:01:39.300 --> 1:01:40.801
Aiden?

1:01:46.340 --> 1:01:47.975
Congrats.

1:01:52.346 --> 1:01:54.081
Are you okay?

1:02:06.026 --> 1:02:07.596
Come on.

1:02:07.629 --> 1:02:09.964
Let's celebrate.

1:02:09.997 --> 1:02:11.398
Okay.

1:02:17.505 --> 1:02:19.541
Get this shit started!

1:02:19.574 --> 1:02:22.042
We gonna party
'til the break of dawn!

1:02:24.445 --> 1:02:28.315
Exactly. You're right.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Come on.

1:02:28.349 --> 1:02:31.218
-What's going on, man?
-What's going on, man?
-You alright?

1:02:31.252 --> 1:02:32.953
What up, pretty boy?
How we doin'?

1:02:32.987 --> 1:02:34.388
Yeah, go ahead
and help yourself.

1:02:34.421 --> 1:02:35.724
Help yourself.

1:02:35.756 --> 1:02:37.491
It's good to see you too,
princess.

1:02:37.525 --> 1:02:40.695
Shall I bring
the ladies with us?

1:02:40.729 --> 1:02:42.129
These guys...

1:02:42.162 --> 1:02:44.398
Joe Cool right there.
That's right, man.

1:02:44.431 --> 1:02:46.000
Listen. Relax, bro. Relax.

1:02:46.033 --> 1:02:48.102
I'll take care of that.

1:02:48.135 --> 1:02:49.470
Alright! Whoo!

1:02:49.503 --> 1:02:51.438
Hey! Who needs a drink? You do!

1:03:30.712 --> 1:03:32.179
Everything good?

1:03:33.548 --> 1:03:35.249
-You doing okay, Aiden?
-Mm-hmm.

1:03:35.282 --> 1:03:38.419
Mm-hmm? That's good.

1:03:38.452 --> 1:03:39.587
Yeah.

1:03:42.389 --> 1:03:43.525
I'll see you in a second.

1:03:43.558 --> 1:03:44.958
-Why?
-One second.

1:04:09.149 --> 1:04:10.951
LL. It's an honor
to meet you, man.

1:04:10.984 --> 1:04:14.188
I appreciate you guys
coming out tonight.

1:04:14.221 --> 1:04:16.223
What up, son?

1:04:16.256 --> 1:04:18.593
I hear you got some shit
you want to explanate.

1:04:18.626 --> 1:04:20.060
Yeah, yeah, for sure.

1:04:20.094 --> 1:04:21.895
But pleasure
before business, right?

1:04:21.929 --> 1:04:25.432
You know, we're just-- we're
just poppin' it off back there.
Kickin' back.

1:04:25.466 --> 1:04:27.101
-Kick back?
-Yeah.

1:04:27.134 --> 1:04:29.738
You want us to kick back at
your fuckin' high school party?

1:04:29.771 --> 1:04:31.071
Aiden!

1:04:31.105 --> 1:04:32.540
You fuckin' trippin', son?

1:04:32.574 --> 1:04:33.907
What the fuck, yo?

1:04:33.941 --> 1:04:35.744
What's wrong with your boy, yo?

1:04:35.777 --> 1:04:37.945
Yo, you need to get
your head right, son.

1:04:40.582 --> 1:04:41.816
What's up with your girl, man?

1:04:41.850 --> 1:04:44.218
She want to dance and shit,
right?

1:04:44.251 --> 1:04:46.086
Yo, Madonna want to dance
and shit, right?

1:04:46.120 --> 1:04:50.725
What the fuck, yo?
You ain't talking much now, huh?

1:04:50.759 --> 1:04:53.828
You want to kick it,
you want to come correct,
you want to fuckin' chill,

1:04:53.862 --> 1:04:55.162
a little pleasure
before business?

1:04:55.195 --> 1:04:57.197
What kind of business
you talking about, son?

1:04:57.231 --> 1:04:58.767
You want my fuckin' business?

1:04:58.800 --> 1:05:00.401
-Huh?
-We're all good. We're all good.

1:05:00.434 --> 1:05:03.303
No, we ain't all good, son.
We ain't all good at all,
motherfucker.

1:05:03.337 --> 1:05:05.439
You understand what I'm saying?
You...

1:05:07.876 --> 1:05:09.910
I'm just fucking with you, dude.

1:05:11.646 --> 1:05:12.814
He's joking.

1:05:12.847 --> 1:05:14.214
-He's joking.
-Oh, man.

1:05:14.248 --> 1:05:15.916
-It's okay. It's okay.
-Yo, dude...

1:05:15.949 --> 1:05:17.317
I grew up in, like,
Laguna Hills,

1:05:17.351 --> 1:05:19.920
listening to, like, 311
and Incubus and shit.

1:05:19.953 --> 1:05:21.955
-He was joking.
-Alright.

1:05:22.824 --> 1:05:24.224
Yeah.

1:05:24.258 --> 1:05:25.894
Yeah, you want to dance?

1:05:25.926 --> 1:05:27.494
Take your girl dancing,
man.

1:05:27.529 --> 1:05:29.329
Alright. Well, Blake...

1:05:29.363 --> 1:05:30.931
A little business
before pleasure.

1:05:30.964 --> 1:05:32.433
We can do that.

1:05:32.466 --> 1:05:34.636
Set him up. Enjoy, huh?

1:05:34.669 --> 1:05:36.604
-Come on.
-Alright. It's okay.

1:06:16.744 --> 1:06:18.680
This is the best night ever.

1:06:44.438 --> 1:06:47.441
-I got to go.
-What? Where?

1:06:47.474 --> 1:06:48.543
I'll be back.

1:06:48.576 --> 1:06:51.345
What do you-- Okay.

1:08:06.153 --> 1:08:07.487
What are you doing here?

1:08:07.522 --> 1:08:10.525
Just keeping an eye
on my favorite CI.

1:08:10.558 --> 1:08:13.561
The rest of the team
is up on Elm.

1:08:13.595 --> 1:08:15.063
The rest of the team?

1:08:15.095 --> 1:08:16.731
Have you seen the target?

1:08:18.231 --> 1:08:21.002
Has the target made
an appearance?

1:08:21.035 --> 1:08:22.336
Yeah. He's here.

1:08:22.369 --> 1:08:24.973
How many did he come in with?

1:08:25.006 --> 1:08:27.642
-What?
-How many men is he with?

1:08:27.675 --> 1:08:29.343
Uh...

1:08:31.211 --> 1:08:33.280
-Three, four. Maybe four.
-Okay, that's great.

1:08:33.313 --> 1:08:35.182
That's-- that's good.

1:08:35.215 --> 1:08:36.684
You wired up?

1:08:39.587 --> 1:08:41.889
Yeah.

1:08:41.923 --> 1:08:43.891
I mean, no,
but I was just going to.

1:08:43.925 --> 1:08:47.327
But you are fuckin' high, right?

1:08:47.361 --> 1:08:49.731
I mean, yeah.
I am a little bit high.

1:08:49.764 --> 1:08:52.667
I mean, fuck it,
it's a party, right?
Of course I'm gonna be high.

1:08:52.700 --> 1:08:55.168
I'm getting tired of you giving
me shit all the time, Wall.

1:08:55.202 --> 1:08:56.638
This might be your fucking case,

1:08:56.671 --> 1:08:59.139
but you got nothing without me,
you get that? Fucking--

1:09:04.277 --> 1:09:05.647
Biggest fucking collar
in my life,

1:09:05.680 --> 1:09:09.416
my goddamn CI
isn't even wired up.

1:09:11.753 --> 1:09:14.454
You little piece of shit.
I should have fucking--

1:09:14.488 --> 1:09:16.124
-I should have fucking--
-Tha-tha-tha--

1:09:16.156 --> 1:09:17.692
Throw me, what,
into fucking prison?

1:09:17.725 --> 1:09:21.062
At this point?
A fucking safe haven for you.

1:09:21.095 --> 1:09:22.462
Because what that would mean,
Aiden,

1:09:22.496 --> 1:09:24.032
is that you've only managed
to fuck up

1:09:24.065 --> 1:09:25.700
your own little pathetic life,

1:09:25.733 --> 1:09:27.568
and not the lives
of everyone around you.

1:09:27.602 --> 1:09:30.605
-No, no, this isn't my--
-Do you get what this is about?
Do you get it?

1:09:30.638 --> 1:09:32.573
Huh?

1:09:32.607 --> 1:09:35.409
This is about me, and fuck it,
not everybody else.

1:09:35.442 --> 1:09:36.878
You think
you don't pull this off

1:09:36.911 --> 1:09:40.280
and things just go back
to the way they were, huh?

1:09:40.313 --> 1:09:41.749
Running around,

1:09:41.783 --> 1:09:44.686
chasing some college
dorm room dealer to pinch?

1:09:44.719 --> 1:09:48.956
Kid, you throw this hail Mary
even a yard short,

1:09:48.990 --> 1:09:50.892
and you can kiss it goodbye.

1:09:50.925 --> 1:09:52.560
Fuck you.

1:09:52.593 --> 1:09:54.461
Look, let me put it to you
like this.

1:09:54.494 --> 1:09:57.765
If you don't deliver me
this LL tonight,

1:09:57.799 --> 1:09:59.534
I mean, right fucking now,

1:09:59.567 --> 1:10:02.235
there's going to be
major consequences.

1:10:02.269 --> 1:10:04.005
Fuck you! I've done everything
you've fucking asked.

1:10:04.038 --> 1:10:07.374
What's that kid
you're running around with--
Blake, I think, is his name?

1:10:07.407 --> 1:10:09.944
Thinks you're his boy
and that you got his back?

1:10:09.977 --> 1:10:12.279
You know how many times over
I got him on possession,

1:10:12.312 --> 1:10:13.781
thanks to you?

1:10:13.815 --> 1:10:15.215
Wait, no, no. Fuck that.

1:10:15.248 --> 1:10:17.250
I got him on trafficking,
dead to rights.

1:10:17.284 --> 1:10:19.554
He'll do 20 years, no parole,

1:10:19.587 --> 1:10:21.488
and I'll make goddamn well sure
he fucking knows

1:10:21.522 --> 1:10:23.524
it was you that put him there.

1:10:23.558 --> 1:10:25.693
What's that little hot piece
of ass? What's her name?

1:10:25.727 --> 1:10:27.995
The one you been running around
with, what's her name, huh?

1:10:28.029 --> 1:10:29.163
What's her name?

1:10:29.197 --> 1:10:30.363
-Huh?
-No, you fucking don't.

1:10:30.397 --> 1:10:31.799
I think an accessory rap

1:10:31.833 --> 1:10:34.301
might put a little damper
on her plans, no?

1:10:34.334 --> 1:10:36.771
What do you think a record
might do to her future?

1:10:36.804 --> 1:10:38.238
Don't need to prove it.

1:10:38.271 --> 1:10:41.809
Just the smell of smoke
from a goddamn struck match
in these colleges,

1:10:41.843 --> 1:10:45.546
they start looking elsewhere
for their "leg up" candidates.

1:10:53.320 --> 1:10:55.189
-Fuck.
-Okay.

1:10:55.223 --> 1:10:56.289
Okay, okay. Come here.

1:10:56.323 --> 1:10:57.424
Come here, come here.

1:10:57.457 --> 1:11:01.629
Okay. Okay. Okay.

1:11:01.662 --> 1:11:03.296
Okay.

1:11:05.666 --> 1:11:07.267
Okay.

1:11:07.300 --> 1:11:10.238
Look at you.

1:11:10.270 --> 1:11:13.241
Now, I'm going to need
to hear you say it, Aiden.

1:11:13.273 --> 1:11:15.109
Come on, Aiden.

1:11:15.143 --> 1:11:16.343
-Say it.
-I-I-I--

1:11:16.376 --> 1:11:17.845
Uh--uh--

1:11:20.882 --> 1:11:22.083
Say it.

1:11:22.116 --> 1:11:23.785
I-I don't--

1:11:26.187 --> 1:11:27.889
Fucking say it.

1:11:27.922 --> 1:11:29.389
I'm not-- I won't--

1:11:31.626 --> 1:11:33.728
I'm not gonna fuck this up.

1:11:33.761 --> 1:11:34.962
Okay.

1:11:34.996 --> 1:11:36.063
Okay.

1:11:36.097 --> 1:11:38.566
See how simple that was?

1:11:38.599 --> 1:11:41.035
Now, you keep your head
together,

1:11:41.068 --> 1:11:42.537
and your happy little pals

1:11:42.570 --> 1:11:45.338
just might get to keep
their happy little lives.

1:11:45.372 --> 1:11:47.474
But that depends on you.

1:11:50.945 --> 1:11:53.313
Aiden...

1:11:53.346 --> 1:11:54.816
Aiden, Aiden, Aiden, Aiden.

1:11:54.849 --> 1:11:57.317
Stand up. Come on.

1:11:57.350 --> 1:11:59.419
I chose you
because you're strong.

1:11:59.452 --> 1:12:01.189
You're stronger than this.

1:12:01.222 --> 1:12:03.490
Now, you know these guys.

1:12:03.524 --> 1:12:05.159
And you know what they want.

1:12:05.193 --> 1:12:08.529
But they don't have to know you.

1:12:08.563 --> 1:12:10.497
Now, you can hustle anyone.
Am I right?

1:12:10.531 --> 1:12:12.767
- Yeah.
- I know I'm right.

1:12:12.800 --> 1:12:14.501
Okay. Chin up,

1:12:14.535 --> 1:12:16.971
pull it together,
and let's finish this.

1:12:17.004 --> 1:12:18.139
Okay?

1:12:18.172 --> 1:12:19.740
-Okay.
-Look at me.

1:12:19.774 --> 1:12:20.808
Finish this.

1:12:20.842 --> 1:12:22.777
Let's go. Come on.

1:12:25.146 --> 1:12:26.647
I'm right here.

1:12:40.228 --> 1:12:41.529
Listen up.

1:12:41.562 --> 1:12:44.497
Target is Local Legend,
a lieutenant for V Mob.

1:12:44.532 --> 1:12:46.701
V Mob runs drugs
over state lines,

1:12:46.734 --> 1:12:48.569
across our sovereign borders.

1:12:48.603 --> 1:12:51.572
Legend and his muscle
possess vital intel

1:12:51.606 --> 1:12:54.342
on how V Mob runs
their organization.

1:12:54.374 --> 1:12:57.879
Our priority is
to capture Legend.

1:12:57.912 --> 1:13:00.014
Without a house full
of teenage hostages?

1:13:00.047 --> 1:13:01.115
Officer.

1:13:02.550 --> 1:13:04.218
You have something
you want to contribute?

1:13:04.252 --> 1:13:05.485
Yeah, with all due respect, sir,

1:13:05.519 --> 1:13:07.121
there's a thousand ways
this goes wrong.

1:13:07.154 --> 1:13:08.990
Unless you want
to sit this one out,

1:13:09.023 --> 1:13:11.391
I advise you to do your job.

1:13:11.424 --> 1:13:14.494
Are we clear?

1:13:14.528 --> 1:13:17.565
Alright, gentlemen.
Let's talk about entry points.

1:14:06.380 --> 1:14:09.951
Hey, man.
Who the fuck are these people?

1:14:09.984 --> 1:14:11.419
Whatever, man.

1:14:11.451 --> 1:14:13.554
No, look, this shit
is getting out of hand, bro.

1:14:13.587 --> 1:14:15.990
I don't know
half of these heads in here.

1:14:16.023 --> 1:14:16.958
Just tear it apart.

1:14:16.991 --> 1:14:20.094
Fuck all that, man!
Listen to me, bro.

1:14:20.127 --> 1:14:21.896
You need to control this shit.

1:14:21.929 --> 1:14:23.564
Are you alright?

1:14:23.597 --> 1:14:27.568
Tear... this shit apart!

1:14:59.066 --> 1:15:00.634
Layla?

1:15:12.446 --> 1:15:13.814
What the fuck are you doing?

1:15:15.316 --> 1:15:17.184
Caleb, what the fuck?!

1:15:20.654 --> 1:15:22.223
-What is wrong with you?
-Relax!

1:15:22.256 --> 1:15:24.225
You don't even know her.

1:15:25.993 --> 1:15:28.496
-No, stop, come on.
-You're fucking dead, Aiden.

1:15:28.529 --> 1:15:30.531
-You're fucking dead!
-We'll get him. Not now.

<i>You wired up?</i>

1:16:50.611 --> 1:16:52.746
I got delayed. I'm on it.

1:16:57.685 --> 1:16:58.719
Hey. Hey, Liz.

1:16:58.752 --> 1:16:59.787
Where's Aiden at?

1:16:59.820 --> 1:17:02.389
I just saw him
with two other girls.

1:17:02.423 --> 1:17:03.958
What?

1:17:03.991 --> 1:17:05.860
I don't know who he is tonight.

1:17:05.893 --> 1:17:08.028
- Alright, I'll be back.
- Fuck.

1:17:11.932 --> 1:17:13.400
Hey.

1:17:13.434 --> 1:17:14.502
You alright?

1:17:14.536 --> 1:17:16.737
I said not fucking now!

1:17:16.770 --> 1:17:19.940
Listen, Liz is messed up
right now, bro.
What's going on?

1:17:22.276 --> 1:17:24.445
I-I have to do this, alright?

1:17:24.478 --> 1:17:25.846
I-I have to.

1:17:25.880 --> 1:17:27.848
Well, I don't know what you're
talking about, but, um...

1:17:27.882 --> 1:17:31.285
listen, you're in no shape
or form to be going
and talking to LL right now.

1:17:31.318 --> 1:17:33.354
Sure I am, Blake.

1:17:33.387 --> 1:17:35.923
You fucking said so yourself.
I'm a monster, right?

1:17:35.956 --> 1:17:39.827
I am. I want you to get the fuck
out of my face.

1:17:41.362 --> 1:17:43.197
I said get the fuck out!

1:17:45.534 --> 1:17:47.134
I'm gone, asshole.

1:18:10.659 --> 1:18:12.693
Let me help you.

1:18:13.894 --> 1:18:15.462
I'm losing my fucking mind.

1:18:15.496 --> 1:18:17.932
Stress is very dangerous.

1:18:19.900 --> 1:18:22.303
-I can't.
-Yes, you can.

1:18:22.336 --> 1:18:24.738
Yes. I know you can.

1:18:26.508 --> 1:18:28.909
There's no plan anymore.

1:18:28.943 --> 1:18:32.146
I gave all of Wall's money
to you.

1:18:32.179 --> 1:18:34.915
I don't even know if anything
I recorded of him will help.

1:18:36.750 --> 1:18:39.153
I gotta give everything to LL,
and...

1:18:39.186 --> 1:18:41.388
and I can't run.

1:18:41.422 --> 1:18:42.890
I don't know where to go.

1:18:45.492 --> 1:18:47.061
I know.

1:18:50.965 --> 1:18:53.500
So, maybe that's
the only alternative, then.

1:18:55.402 --> 1:18:57.471
-Maybe.
-Maybe...

1:19:00.074 --> 1:19:02.109
May. Be.

1:19:08.015 --> 1:19:10.518
I just don't want to live
in pain anymore.

1:19:11.819 --> 1:19:13.954
Death is easy.

1:19:13.988 --> 1:19:15.422
Safe.

1:19:15.456 --> 1:19:20.928
No prison. No shame. No pain.
No needing anymore.

1:19:20.961 --> 1:19:23.698
We can be together again,

1:19:23.732 --> 1:19:26.300
the way we used to be.

1:19:37.211 --> 1:19:39.681
<i>Aiden, are you there?</i>

1:19:39.714 --> 1:19:42.216
<i>-Aiden.</i>
-Mom?

1:19:42.249 --> 1:19:43.784
<i>Aiden, I'm so sorry</i>
<i>it's so late,</i>

1:19:43.817 --> 1:19:44.918
<i>but I am stuck at this lounge.</i>

1:19:44.952 --> 1:19:46.588
<i>It's been a whole thing.</i>

1:19:46.621 --> 1:19:48.723
<i>-Anyway, we're delayed...</i>
-Hey, Mom?

1:19:48.757 --> 1:19:50.190
<i>Yeah, honey?</i>

1:19:53.494 --> 1:19:55.496
Remember that beach house?

1:19:57.865 --> 1:20:00.134
What does that have to do
with anything?

1:20:00.167 --> 1:20:02.836
I would always fantasize
about us escaping there.

1:20:02.870 --> 1:20:05.139
<i>Come on, Aiden, no...</i>

1:20:05.172 --> 1:20:07.341
<i>That was ages ago.</i>
<i>Your dad is long gone.</i>

1:20:07.374 --> 1:20:10.077
<i>Just-- we don't really need</i>
<i>to get into any of this.</i>

1:20:10.110 --> 1:20:11.812
I'd really like
to go there now, Mom.

1:20:11.845 --> 1:20:15.416
Aiden, I know that
you've been through a lot.

1:20:15.449 --> 1:20:18.185
I knew, Mom. About you and Dad.

1:20:18.218 --> 1:20:19.754
<i>I-I get it.</i>

1:20:19.788 --> 1:20:21.855
I just--
I just wanted you to know,

1:20:21.889 --> 1:20:23.490
I'm very sorry about
how everything went.

1:20:23.525 --> 1:20:24.825
<i>For so long,</i>

1:20:24.858 --> 1:20:26.761
I tried pretending
like I didn't care.

1:20:26.795 --> 1:20:28.829
He is the one who cheated.

1:20:28.862 --> 1:20:31.231
<i>Aiden, I don't blame you.</i>

1:20:31.265 --> 1:20:34.301
<i>I don't blame you</i>
<i>for any of this, okay?</i>

1:20:34.335 --> 1:20:37.404
I'm-- I'm so sorry, Mom.

1:20:39.073 --> 1:20:40.841
<i>-For everything.</i>
-I don't like it.

1:20:40.874 --> 1:20:42.843
I don't like the sound of this.
You're scaring me.

1:20:42.876 --> 1:20:43.911
<i>I love you, Mom.</i>

1:20:43.944 --> 1:20:46.246
I love you so, so much.

1:20:46.280 --> 1:20:47.915
<i>I'm going to come home</i>
<i>right now.</i>

1:20:47.948 --> 1:20:49.784
<i>Okay? Aiden?</i>

1:20:49.818 --> 1:20:51.118
<i>Aiden!</i>

1:21:30.725 --> 1:21:32.326
Alright.

1:21:44.438 --> 1:21:46.508
Tip-fucking-top.

1:21:46.541 --> 1:21:48.375
Subject is on the premises.

1:21:48.409 --> 1:21:51.378
<i>There are four targets</i>
<i>in total. I repeat:</i>

1:21:51.412 --> 1:21:53.080
Four targets in total.

1:21:53.113 --> 1:21:55.015
CI is getting into position.

1:21:55.048 --> 1:21:56.618
Hold for my signal.

1:22:05.225 --> 1:22:07.060
Boys.

1:22:07.094 --> 1:22:09.263
Where's the boss?

1:22:09.296 --> 1:22:12.567
Little man. It's about time.

1:22:17.906 --> 1:22:20.040
Is that really necessary?

1:22:23.511 --> 1:22:25.345
Yeah, he's straight.

1:22:33.220 --> 1:22:36.724
We dead serious
about that cash, my man.

1:22:36.758 --> 1:22:38.526
You came
to my fucking party.

1:22:43.163 --> 1:22:45.733
Fifty and large.
It's in the bag.

1:22:49.436 --> 1:22:52.139
I thought Blake
was just talking up his boy.

1:22:52.172 --> 1:22:55.944
I see what you guys got
goin' on, and I want in.

1:22:55.976 --> 1:22:57.411
I can move volume,

1:22:57.444 --> 1:22:59.012
expand across
fuckin' territories

1:22:59.046 --> 1:23:01.583
without it coming back on you.

1:23:01.616 --> 1:23:05.720
And if that's
something you want,
then, you know, I want to work.

1:23:05.753 --> 1:23:08.288
What do you know
about work, Aiden?

1:23:08.322 --> 1:23:10.123
Excuse me?

1:23:10.157 --> 1:23:12.359
You work for any of this shit
you got here?

1:23:14.061 --> 1:23:15.697
You work so your daddy
don't fuck up your face

1:23:15.730 --> 1:23:19.767
if you look at him wrong,
say the wrong thing?

1:23:19.801 --> 1:23:24.137
Nah. I bet not.

1:23:24.171 --> 1:23:27.742
I bet birthdays
around this hood--

1:23:27.775 --> 1:23:29.042
Nah, fuck that.

1:23:29.076 --> 1:23:31.044
I bet a glowin' fuckin'
report card

1:23:31.078 --> 1:23:33.648
gets you a brand-new car.

1:23:35.148 --> 1:23:38.218
Or a deep-sea fishing trip
down to the Caribbean.

1:23:38.252 --> 1:23:39.119
Right?

1:23:39.152 --> 1:23:42.322
It sounds so nice.

1:23:42.356 --> 1:23:46.794
Did you work
for what's in that bag?

1:23:48.796 --> 1:23:52.199
Or is that just the golden boy's
weekly allowance?

1:23:52.232 --> 1:23:54.936
This ain't about me.

1:23:54.969 --> 1:23:56.838
It's about the money in the bag.

1:23:56.871 --> 1:23:59.874
And I don't think you give
a fuck about where it came from.

1:23:59.908 --> 1:24:03.076
Now, are we talking,
or are we selling?

1:24:03.110 --> 1:24:05.479
You got a spark, man.

1:24:05.513 --> 1:24:07.147
Even if you are
all kinds of fucked up,

1:24:07.180 --> 1:24:08.950
'cause, you know...

1:24:08.983 --> 1:24:11.886
which one of us isn't, right?

1:24:11.920 --> 1:24:13.220
Right.

1:24:14.522 --> 1:24:15.723
So, we cool?

1:24:15.757 --> 1:24:17.224
Yeah, we're good?

1:24:19.527 --> 1:24:21.563
Leave the cash.

1:24:21.596 --> 1:24:23.998
Blake will get you sorted out
day after tomorrow.

1:24:24.032 --> 1:24:25.667
I thought
I was gonna get some now.

1:24:25.700 --> 1:24:29.037
Do you really think
that I would just bring
50 large worth of powder

1:24:29.069 --> 1:24:30.838
to some rich boy's mansion
I don't even know?

1:24:30.872 --> 1:24:33.073
But Blake vouched for me.

1:24:38.680 --> 1:24:40.848
Are we gonna have
a problem here, Aiden?

1:24:40.882 --> 1:24:42.349
Jesus, kid.

1:24:42.382 --> 1:24:45.085
<i>Stand by, Ames.</i>
<i>We may have to move in.</i>

1:24:45.118 --> 1:24:47.655
Alright, roger that.
We're locked and loaded.

1:24:47.689 --> 1:24:50.357
Right at the beginning
of our fuckin' relationship?

1:24:51.659 --> 1:24:53.561
No.

1:24:53.595 --> 1:24:55.329
No, no problem.

1:24:55.362 --> 1:24:58.498
You're asking me to trust you.

1:24:59.901 --> 1:25:01.501
That...

1:25:02.870 --> 1:25:04.772
is you trusting me.

1:25:07.107 --> 1:25:09.010
So, I'm going to take
the cash tonight.

1:25:09.043 --> 1:25:10.177
Come on, Aiden.

1:25:10.210 --> 1:25:11.646
Think, son.

1:25:13.615 --> 1:25:17.150
You give me that shit,
that puritan large,

1:25:17.184 --> 1:25:19.119
I'll turn it around in 48 hours.

1:25:19.152 --> 1:25:20.420
No, fuck that.

1:25:20.454 --> 1:25:21.956
I'll turn it around
even quicker.

1:25:21.990 --> 1:25:24.859
24 hours, pure profit,
nothin' else.

1:25:26.861 --> 1:25:28.261
But if not...

1:25:34.334 --> 1:25:37.137
...then I think I'm gonna have
to take that bag with me.

1:25:39.107 --> 1:25:40.541
You feel me?

1:25:56.024 --> 1:25:57.792
You ain't got a spark.

1:25:59.459 --> 1:26:02.462
You got
a motherfuckin' bonfire.

1:26:05.265 --> 1:26:07.200
Let's fuckin' rule the world,
little man.

1:26:10.370 --> 1:26:13.240
I am all about this kid.
Give him his shit.

1:26:16.744 --> 1:26:18.646
That's pure.

1:26:18.680 --> 1:26:20.548
Ten large.

1:26:20.581 --> 1:26:23.383
You cut it up, you put it
on the street...

1:26:25.419 --> 1:26:27.855
Then bring me back 50
sometime next week.

1:26:27.889 --> 1:26:29.891
Oh, and, uh...

1:26:29.924 --> 1:26:32.026
I work alone. So...

1:26:32.060 --> 1:26:34.662
Blake... leave that kid
out of it, huh?

1:26:37.065 --> 1:26:38.933
Enjoy your high school party.

1:26:40.400 --> 1:26:42.603
This is your last night
in the minor leagues.

1:26:45.472 --> 1:26:47.441
We got that motherfucker.

1:26:47.474 --> 1:26:48.910
Let's get my boy out.

1:26:50.712 --> 1:26:52.914
Alright, SWAT,
move for the perimeter.

1:26:52.947 --> 1:26:54.414
All eyes on the house.

1:27:02.957 --> 1:27:04.826
There's that motherfucker!

1:27:10.397 --> 1:27:13.801
You're one big asshole.

1:27:17.171 --> 1:27:18.673
My mom hits harder than that.

1:27:18.706 --> 1:27:20.942
Shut the fuck up!

1:27:27.148 --> 1:27:28.716
Get him the fuck up.

1:27:30.350 --> 1:27:33.554
Put him up on the wall.

1:27:33.588 --> 1:27:37.692
Hey... try running track
with a broken rib.

1:27:38.960 --> 1:27:40.795
You know what, yo?

1:27:40.828 --> 1:27:42.462
Fuck the gym candy.

1:27:42.496 --> 1:27:45.967
This... well, this is
all I need.

1:27:46.000 --> 1:27:48.569
- Get off--!
- Back off!

1:27:48.603 --> 1:27:49.737
Fuck you!

1:27:49.771 --> 1:27:51.939
You got to hit
harder than that.

1:27:51.973 --> 1:27:53.406
Let that bitch watch. He's next!

1:27:53.440 --> 1:27:54.876
Blake, get the fuck out of here.

1:27:54.909 --> 1:27:56.043
What the fuck is that?

1:27:56.077 --> 1:28:00.413
- Yo, Caleb, he's bugged!
- Aiden, you're a narc?!

1:28:00.447 --> 1:28:04.417
- Initiate. Go, go, go!
- Alright, that's it!
Move it, move it, move it!

1:28:04.451 --> 1:28:06.020
Oh, this is perfect.

1:28:06.053 --> 1:28:07.555
Blake, I'm sorry. I--

1:28:07.588 --> 1:28:10.825
What are
you babies fighting about?

1:28:10.858 --> 1:28:13.561
Motherfuckin' sandbox?

1:28:13.594 --> 1:28:15.029
Yo!

1:28:15.062 --> 1:28:17.932
Yo! Yo!

1:28:21.702 --> 1:28:22.937
Hold on, man.

1:28:22.970 --> 1:28:24.371
Oh, it's this way?

1:28:24.404 --> 1:28:25.807
Hold on. Hold on!

1:28:25.840 --> 1:28:28.042
Dude's wearing
a motherfuckin' wire!

1:28:30.144 --> 1:28:31.179
Come on!

1:28:34.282 --> 1:28:36.217
Police! Police!

1:28:36.250 --> 1:28:38.886
On the ground now!
Move, move, move!

1:28:40.955 --> 1:28:42.023
Shit.

1:28:43.291 --> 1:28:45.760
Shit. Stay down.

1:28:50.064 --> 1:28:51.364
- Shit.
- Stay down!

1:28:51.398 --> 1:28:53.366
Don't... move!

1:28:53.400 --> 1:28:55.636
How long, man?

1:28:58.206 --> 1:28:59.974
How long this shit
been going on?

1:29:00.007 --> 1:29:01.275
Fuck!

1:29:01.309 --> 1:29:03.044
I told you to get the fuck out.

1:29:03.077 --> 1:29:05.680
I'm not gonna leave my brother.

1:29:07.447 --> 1:29:10.017
You know I got to kill you
for this shit, right?

1:29:11.786 --> 1:29:15.790
- Stay down! Stay down!
- Don't... move!

1:29:15.823 --> 1:29:18.425
You can kill me later.
Just for now, don't die on me.

1:29:18.458 --> 1:29:20.895
-Go get some help, man!
-I'm gonna get some help. Just--

1:29:24.599 --> 1:29:27.367
Aiden!

1:29:35.910 --> 1:29:37.111
Uh!

1:29:43.851 --> 1:29:44.952
Hey.

1:29:48.756 --> 1:29:49.891
Liz.

1:29:51.993 --> 1:29:54.996
Aiden... what is this?

1:29:59.000 --> 1:30:02.270
Okay, now, listen to me.

1:30:02.303 --> 1:30:04.238
We have to go on three.

1:30:04.272 --> 1:30:07.275
I can't-- I ca--
They'll kill us.

1:30:07.308 --> 1:30:08.609
Come on.

1:30:15.850 --> 1:30:17.852
Uh!

1:30:17.885 --> 1:30:19.186
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

1:30:19.220 --> 1:30:21.389
This way! Now!

1:30:21.421 --> 1:30:22.890
Motherfuck--!

1:30:22.924 --> 1:30:24.191
Where the fuck you at?

1:30:32.400 --> 1:30:34.936
No...

1:30:34.969 --> 1:30:36.037
No!

1:30:36.070 --> 1:30:39.040
It was my fucking collar, man!

1:30:44.412 --> 1:30:46.948
No, Aiden!

1:30:46.981 --> 1:30:50.084
You can't stop, Aiden.

1:30:50.117 --> 1:30:51.852
I just need to sit down.

1:30:51.886 --> 1:30:52.987
Please...

1:31:02.396 --> 1:31:03.965
Please, baby.

1:31:09.637 --> 1:31:11.572
Listen to me, okay? Okay?

1:31:13.708 --> 1:31:16.243
It's okay.

1:31:16.277 --> 1:31:18.045
I'm gonna go get help, okay?

1:31:18.079 --> 1:31:19.347
Go.

1:31:19.380 --> 1:31:21.749
I'll be back, okay?

1:31:21.782 --> 1:31:23.483
Okay.

1:31:23.517 --> 1:31:24.685
Go get help. Okay.

1:34:27.234 --> 1:34:29.236
I need help.

1:35:02.102 --> 1:35:05.172
Town's a little different than
I described it back in the day.

1:35:08.876 --> 1:35:11.378
You know, nothing stays
like you remember it.

1:35:13.447 --> 1:35:15.382
It's nice.

1:35:15.416 --> 1:35:17.017
I like it.

1:35:19.920 --> 1:35:22.723
Layla and her mom disappeared.

1:35:25.560 --> 1:35:28.796
Something must have lit a fire
underneath that woman.

1:35:31.732 --> 1:35:33.267
Hey, Mom...

1:35:37.004 --> 1:35:39.206
I'm not going anywhere.

1:35:55.089 --> 1:35:57.324
Hey, Mom...

1:35:58.425 --> 1:36:00.261
I love you.

1:36:01.563 --> 1:36:03.163
You're so nice.

1:36:04.599 --> 1:36:06.166
I love you too.

1:36:09.336 --> 1:36:10.871
It's okay.

1:36:11.706 --> 1:36:13.173
It's okay.

1:36:27.121 --> 1:36:30.891
I heard you were doing well.

1:36:30.924 --> 1:36:33.160
You look good.

1:36:33.193 --> 1:36:35.195
Yeah, well, you look like shit.

1:36:35.229 --> 1:36:36.363
Yeah, well...

1:36:36.397 --> 1:36:38.799
I haven't been sleeping great
lately.

1:36:43.304 --> 1:36:45.540
So, I, uh...

1:36:45.573 --> 1:36:46.775
I heard you got a medal.

1:36:46.807 --> 1:36:49.009
A medal is just
so no one questions

1:36:49.043 --> 1:36:51.912
whether or not it was
a worthy cause.

1:36:52.747 --> 1:36:54.582
It was, right?

1:36:55.949 --> 1:36:58.385
You were really something
that night, Aiden.

1:36:58.419 --> 1:37:01.523
Brave... Got that girl out.

1:37:01.556 --> 1:37:03.390
You kept your head together,

1:37:03.424 --> 1:37:06.026
when most grown men
that I know wouldn't have.

1:37:06.060 --> 1:37:08.295
I wanted you to know that.

1:37:08.329 --> 1:37:11.965
My lawyer says the state's not
pressing for a prison sentence.

1:37:11.999 --> 1:37:14.636
A two-year probation
and 500 hours' community service

1:37:14.669 --> 1:37:17.071
is what's on the table.

1:37:17.104 --> 1:37:19.473
You got anything to do
with that?

1:37:21.275 --> 1:37:24.445
I told you
I'd go to bat for you.

1:37:30.050 --> 1:37:33.887
Look, I'm staying
at this little motel in town.

1:37:33.921 --> 1:37:35.757
The Sea Captain.

1:37:35.790 --> 1:37:37.458
Smells like one.

1:37:37.491 --> 1:37:40.461
But it's got a great view
of the harbor.

1:37:40.494 --> 1:37:43.765
I like watching those boats
coming in and out.

1:37:43.798 --> 1:37:47.101
I think I'll extend
for a few days.

1:37:48.469 --> 1:37:51.773
Can't remember the last time
I had a vacation.

1:37:51.806 --> 1:37:56.176
You know... I don't know
if I've ever had one.

1:37:56.210 --> 1:37:57.512
Sounds nice.

1:37:59.279 --> 1:38:02.617
Maybe tomorrow, come by,
take you out for a bite?

1:38:05.553 --> 1:38:07.221
I, uh...

1:38:10.692 --> 1:38:12.926
I think I'd like that.

1:38:14.829 --> 1:38:16.564
