MARTY:
<i>Previously, on</i> House of Lies...

00:02.117 --> 00:03.617
Hi.
Hi! Hi.

00:03.652 --> 00:05.486
You know, you got your
cute little vegan chef.

00:05.520 --> 00:07.154
<i>Come on, this isn't you, Monica.</i>

00:07.189 --> 00:08.956
Me? My name is
Julianne Hofschraeger,

00:08.990 --> 00:11.325
and I am the interim CEO.

00:11.359 --> 00:12.793
You think your house is
a better place for me to be,

00:12.828 --> 00:14.128
but you keep not showing up for me, Dad.

00:14.162 --> 00:15.262
Not-not showing up?
What am I supposed to do?

00:15.297 --> 00:16.263
Are we not sitting here right now?

00:16.297 --> 00:18.799
A lot of weird stuff
happened that night.

00:18.834 --> 00:21.235
<i>I blacked out, so...</i>

00:21.269 --> 00:22.636
(grunts)
(retches)

00:22.671 --> 00:23.637
<i>Did we...?</i>

00:23.672 --> 00:24.939
I don't remember, either.

00:25.059 --> 00:31.660

00:31.780 --> 00:33.781
(elevator bell dings)

00:33.815 --> 00:35.216
Fucking animals.
You don't want to run to him?

00:35.250 --> 00:37.251
You don't want to give a quick run?

00:37.285 --> 00:38.619
MARTY: Okay, Roscoe,
it'll be great.

00:38.653 --> 00:39.939
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa.
Marty, Marty.

00:40.162 --> 00:41.402
Yeah. I'll see you
later, buddy.

00:41.430 --> 00:42.597
All right, bye-bye.
Look, Marty.

00:42.631 --> 00:43.731
He's coming and we're nowhere.

00:43.766 --> 00:45.500
Doug, will you just take a breath?

00:45.534 --> 00:47.402
Okay? Clear out
a conference room

00:47.436 --> 00:48.504
and start chunking out some shit.

00:48.624 --> 00:49.411
We'll call it a work session.

00:49.527 --> 00:50.727
Listen to yourself.

00:50.762 --> 00:52.362
Clean out-- We don't have
a clean conference room?

00:52.396 --> 00:53.830
This is the worst day of my life.

00:53.865 --> 00:55.332
Douglas, shut the fuck up, okay?

00:55.366 --> 00:56.399
It's Matt Damon.

00:56.434 --> 00:58.001
He's used to living in a yurt

00:58.035 --> 01:00.103
with uncircumcised refugees.

01:00.138 --> 01:01.972
I'm sure a couple pieces
of paper are fine.

01:02.006 --> 01:03.327
I just...
I want it to be perfect.

01:03.341 --> 01:04.808
You know? I-I...

01:04.842 --> 01:06.143
Why didn't he give us some more notice?

01:06.177 --> 01:08.612
I could've made some
sexy regression models,

01:08.646 --> 01:10.313
could've gotten permission from Admin to

01:10.348 --> 01:11.915
get that deluxe bagel and lox spread

01:11.949 --> 01:13.250
we sometimes get;
he would've loved that.

01:13.284 --> 01:14.751
Shit. This just occurred to me.

01:14.786 --> 01:16.086
We could've gotten treats from

01:16.120 --> 01:17.120
Sweet Lady Jane.
"Treats."

01:17.155 --> 01:18.321
Could've been special.

01:18.356 --> 01:19.322
Now it's not, it's ruined.

01:19.357 --> 01:20.590
The whole thing's ruined.

01:20.625 --> 01:21.658
CLYDE: Probably just
wants to hire us

01:21.692 --> 01:23.326
to pimp out his new charity, right?

01:23.361 --> 01:25.629
Chances are, he's meeting with
every consultancy in town.

01:25.663 --> 01:27.397
So this is what we're gonna do.

01:27.431 --> 01:28.532
And tell me if I am correct.

01:28.566 --> 01:30.066
We're gonna let him do the talking.

01:30.101 --> 01:31.501
That's correct.
Then we're gonna flatter

01:31.536 --> 01:33.637
the fuck out of him.
Also correct.

01:33.671 --> 01:34.971
Because he is an actor.

01:35.006 --> 01:36.339
He just wants to be loved.

01:36.374 --> 01:38.074
That's the most correct.
Mm.

01:38.109 --> 01:39.476
(huffs) No.

01:39.510 --> 01:40.477
All right? You know why?

01:40.511 --> 01:41.592
Because he's not like that.

01:42.513 --> 01:43.780
He's unique.

01:47.285 --> 01:50.020
(music plays, game chimes)

01:50.054 --> 01:51.354
(groans)

01:51.389 --> 01:52.889
Om Nom, you little bitch.

01:52.924 --> 01:54.524
Wow, you really are a go-getter.

01:54.559 --> 01:55.725
I am.

01:57.428 --> 01:58.628
Aren't I?

01:58.663 --> 01:59.629
Yeah.

01:59.664 --> 02:01.131
You okay?

02:01.165 --> 02:02.265
I'm good, I guess.

02:02.300 --> 02:04.334
Well, you look good, there's that.

02:04.368 --> 02:05.735
Thank you, Marty.

02:05.770 --> 02:08.138
Hey, you haven't, um...

02:08.172 --> 02:10.273
had any more flashbacks, or...

02:10.308 --> 02:11.641
Oh.
...memories?

02:11.676 --> 02:13.243
Nope.

02:13.277 --> 02:15.178
The well is dry. Whew.

02:15.213 --> 02:16.713
Good.

02:16.747 --> 02:18.081
Yeah. No, it is, it's good.

02:18.115 --> 02:19.082
Yeah.

02:19.116 --> 02:20.083
I mean, me, too.

02:20.117 --> 02:21.084
Not-not a one.

02:21.118 --> 02:22.686
Nothing.
Okay.

02:22.720 --> 02:24.387
Well, look, uh...

02:24.422 --> 02:26.656
we got about 20 minutes
before Damon shows up,

02:26.691 --> 02:28.792
so let's get it together.
Who?

02:28.826 --> 02:30.293
Matt Damon.

02:30.328 --> 02:32.362
Ma... what are
you talking about?

02:32.396 --> 02:34.064
You haven't heard about this?

02:34.098 --> 02:35.498
No.
(chuckles)

02:35.533 --> 02:37.234
His business manager's
a friend of Julianne's.

02:37.268 --> 02:38.535
He's... on his
way over here.

02:38.569 --> 02:39.769
Wha...?
Wants to explore

02:39.804 --> 02:41.338
looking into starting a foundation,

02:41.372 --> 02:43.039
probably he wants a brain dump,

02:43.074 --> 02:44.174
20-minute blue sky.

02:44.208 --> 02:45.342
He's probably meeting all over town.

02:45.376 --> 02:46.509
Okay.

02:46.544 --> 02:47.644
You okay?

02:47.678 --> 02:49.379
Yeah.
You need to stop by the salon?

02:49.413 --> 02:50.881
No, I'm good.

02:50.915 --> 02:52.182
Three, two, one.

02:52.216 --> 02:53.583
Oh, shit.

02:53.618 --> 02:55.252
Doug the Gugg is at a loss.

02:55.286 --> 02:57.921
Doug the Gugg is at a loss.
And that does not happen, it... I mean,

02:57.955 --> 02:59.856
you can't do a statistical model.
You can't do it, it's not possible.

02:59.891 --> 03:01.091
in half an hour, it's not possible.

03:01.125 --> 03:02.259
One can't!

03:02.293 --> 03:03.660
One cannot!
He's gonna explode.

03:03.694 --> 03:04.828
There are too many variables.

03:04.862 --> 03:06.162
What kind of, uh, charity

03:06.197 --> 03:07.163
does he even want to start?

03:07.198 --> 03:08.598
Did he ever say?
Nope, not to me.

03:08.633 --> 03:10.300
Is it a-- what are you doing?--

03:10.334 --> 03:11.701
a grant model?
An awareness model?

03:11.736 --> 03:13.703
Or is it, like, uh,
designed for longevity,

03:13.738 --> 03:14.905
or a single iteration

03:14.939 --> 03:16.806
with a defined endgame scenario?

03:16.841 --> 03:18.642
Oh, what the...Goddamn it!
Hey, Doug, you forgot

03:18.676 --> 03:20.477
to actually shit yourself.

03:20.511 --> 03:22.145
Marty. Hey, buddy.
Ooh, hey.

03:22.179 --> 03:23.546
So, um...

03:23.581 --> 03:25.548
I know that I don't need to tell you

03:25.583 --> 03:28.985
how much it would mean if you
could bring Mr. Mattie D...

03:29.020 --> 03:30.153
(both laugh)

03:30.187 --> 03:31.288
...onto the
Galweather team.

03:31.322 --> 03:32.455
Yeah.
Oh!

03:32.490 --> 03:34.291
I don't know, seems like
kind of a brain drain.

03:34.325 --> 03:36.159
I mean, look, an actor and his cause?

03:36.193 --> 03:37.594
I don't see a lot of possibilities

03:37.628 --> 03:39.262
for monetization in that.
Oh, yeah. True enough.

03:39.297 --> 03:40.263
Yeah.
True enough.

03:40.298 --> 03:43.066
But it would be major

03:43.100 --> 03:44.467
<i>Wall Street Journal</i> porn.

03:44.502 --> 03:45.602
Wow.

03:45.636 --> 03:47.137
Great publicity.
(chuckles)

03:47.171 --> 03:48.138
That's your porn face?

03:48.172 --> 03:49.406
(laughs)
Hot.

03:49.440 --> 03:51.908
Ah! Wow.
(laughing)

03:53.978 --> 03:56.079
Shake that off.

03:56.113 --> 03:57.247
...e-mail you all
the information about

03:57.281 --> 03:58.448
the solar panels.
I mean, you'd be amazed.

03:58.482 --> 03:59.582
I mean, unless I'm just an idiot,

03:59.617 --> 04:01.418
which is totally possible.
(laughs): No.

04:01.452 --> 04:03.420
Oh, my God, I'm sure you're not.

04:03.454 --> 04:05.221
I can't tell you how
much I appreciate it.

04:05.256 --> 04:06.656
It's not a big deal.
No, it's such a big deal.

04:06.691 --> 04:07.724
Thank you so, so much.
Zanna.

04:07.758 --> 04:08.725
Zanna. Zanna.

04:08.759 --> 04:09.726
We're gonna start the...

04:09.760 --> 04:10.794
Oh.
Nice to meet you.

04:10.828 --> 04:11.895
Clyde Oberholt.
Hi. Matt.

04:11.929 --> 04:13.697
How are you?
Doug Guggenheim.

04:13.731 --> 04:14.864
Hi, Doug. Matt.
I know who you are.

04:14.899 --> 04:16.565
Very nice to meet you.
Jeannie Van Der Hooven, hi.

04:16.600 --> 04:17.634
Hi, Jeannie. Matt.
Hi.

04:17.668 --> 04:19.002
MATT: Nice to meet you.
So this is it, huh?

04:19.036 --> 04:20.503
This is the...
the Galweather Stearn

04:20.538 --> 04:22.005
sanctum sanctorum, huh?

04:22.039 --> 04:23.707
You have to go through two more sanctums

04:23.741 --> 04:25.408
to get to the sanctorum.
(laughs)

04:25.443 --> 04:26.743
Right.
Right?

04:28.846 --> 04:31.114
Uh, well, you guys know why I'm here, right?
Yeah.

04:31.148 --> 04:32.882
I, uh, do a lot of philanthropic work

04:32.917 --> 04:35.185
and was looking at starting
something new and, uh,

04:35.219 --> 04:38.355
given your, uh,
your reputation and your...

04:38.389 --> 04:39.856
your ability to identify
symbiotic partnerships,

04:39.890 --> 04:41.491
I just kind of figured if we

04:41.525 --> 04:43.760
kind of got together,
maybe we could just

04:43.794 --> 04:45.628
turbo-charge this
whole thing, and...

04:45.663 --> 04:47.097
we could really do a lot of good.

04:47.131 --> 04:49.766
(laughs)
I think that's really wonderful.

04:49.800 --> 04:51.334
No, it's nothing, really.

04:51.369 --> 04:53.937
It's like... look,
if I can't take this

04:53.971 --> 04:55.538
little bit of, you know...

04:55.573 --> 04:57.374
you know, whatever, stardust,

04:57.408 --> 04:59.609
and-and, uh, and make
something real out of it,

04:59.643 --> 05:01.644
then... I mean,
what the hell am I doing?

05:01.679 --> 05:03.613
- Yeah. Absolutely. - Yeah?
MARTY: Yeah.

05:03.647 --> 05:04.814
But anyway, sorry to ambush you guys,

05:04.849 --> 05:06.149
but I... but I did want to know

05:06.183 --> 05:07.484
where you are, and what you're thinking.

05:07.518 --> 05:09.052
Uh, Doug, you want to take it?

05:09.086 --> 05:10.687
I don't need much notice,
uh, Mr. Damon.

05:10.721 --> 05:12.956
Believe me, you're dealing
with one of the masters

05:12.990 --> 05:15.191
of the, uh... well, art form

05:15.226 --> 05:16.793
really, if you think about it,

05:16.827 --> 05:17.827
in statistical modeling.

05:17.862 --> 05:19.329
Cool.

05:19.363 --> 05:20.530
DOUG: Yeah.
Nothing I can't...

05:20.564 --> 05:21.731
handle.

05:21.766 --> 05:23.199
So why don't you do something?
Right!

05:23.234 --> 05:24.501
Okay. Yeah.
Nothing to it, it's easy.

05:24.535 --> 05:26.069
Okay.
For him to take us, so...

05:26.103 --> 05:27.303
(clears throat)

05:27.338 --> 05:29.005
(whispering):
It's at your desk.

05:29.040 --> 05:30.006
Great.

05:30.041 --> 05:32.042
Here we go.

05:32.076 --> 05:33.209
Epidemics.

05:33.244 --> 05:34.511
Natural disasters.

05:34.545 --> 05:36.379
War. All right?
Takes a very big toll,

05:36.414 --> 05:38.481
both spiritually and
emotionally, on the children

05:38.516 --> 05:40.016
in those affected areas.

05:40.051 --> 05:42.986
Now, the issues facing children
in developing nations

05:43.020 --> 05:44.687
present a unique and complicated

05:44.722 --> 05:45.922
problem set.

05:45.956 --> 05:47.791
As you're no doubt aware from

05:47.825 --> 05:49.526
your involvement
in water.org,

05:49.560 --> 05:51.027
current levels of funding,

05:51.062 --> 05:53.163
while a remarkable accomplishment...

05:53.197 --> 05:54.831
(quietly):
I like your watch, man.

05:54.865 --> 05:57.200
- Oh. - You think you could hook
me up with one of those?

05:57.234 --> 05:58.701
Uh, yeah, sure.

05:58.736 --> 06:01.004
I'm, like, a swag whore.
(chuckles)

06:01.038 --> 06:02.505
Fucking love free shit, man.

06:02.540 --> 06:04.774
Love free shit, right?
Love it. Yeah.

06:04.809 --> 06:06.910
DOUG: An estimated
20 million are displaced

06:06.944 --> 06:08.144
by war, or human rights violations...

06:08.179 --> 06:10.080
(whispers):
Please tell me you hit that.

06:10.114 --> 06:11.081
Please.

06:11.115 --> 06:12.082
You know, I...

06:12.116 --> 06:14.517
I actually don't know.

06:14.552 --> 06:16.553
Really?
Yeah. It's a long story.

06:16.587 --> 06:17.720
That's a good story.

06:17.755 --> 06:19.355
Yeah, it is a good story.

06:19.390 --> 06:21.424
(laughs) You're the big
dog around here, right?

06:21.459 --> 06:22.826
Well, I guess so, yeah.

06:22.860 --> 06:24.394
Okay. 'Cause this dude's
freaking me the fuck out.

06:24.428 --> 06:25.862
He freaks everybody out.

06:25.896 --> 06:27.530
Okay. Look, you know
what I need, right?

06:27.565 --> 06:29.566
I mean, I just basically need a cause

06:29.600 --> 06:31.501
that's about the size
of Clooney's cause,

06:31.535 --> 06:32.735
only with bigger tits.

06:32.770 --> 06:34.037
Huh.
I mean...

06:34.071 --> 06:36.473
that guy, he puts on a Hawaiian shirt,

06:36.507 --> 06:38.675
and they hand him
a fucking Oscar. Right?

06:38.709 --> 06:40.944
I mean, 'cause everybody
thinks he's so deep, you know?

06:40.978 --> 06:43.413
'Cause they see him on TV,
going like, "Grr. Darfur bad."

06:43.447 --> 06:44.414
Yeah.

06:44.448 --> 06:45.615
Fuck him.

06:45.649 --> 06:47.717
I want to be on that podium next year,

06:47.751 --> 06:49.319
pissing down all over his face.

06:49.353 --> 06:51.154
DOUG: ...an estimated
$2 billion...

06:51.188 --> 06:52.655
You feel me?

06:52.690 --> 06:53.790
Yeah.

06:53.824 --> 06:58.795
Do you feel me,
my strong, proud, black brother?

06:58.829 --> 07:01.498
No, I-I do,
I feel you.

07:01.532 --> 07:03.066
DOUG: ...and
fighting HIV/AIDS,

07:03.100 --> 07:04.501
micronutrient supplements...

07:04.535 --> 07:06.503
So it's really a, uh...

07:06.537 --> 07:08.104
DOUG: It's a
complex paradigm.

07:08.139 --> 07:09.172
It's like...

07:09.206 --> 07:10.273
Well, poetry?
Poetry, yeah.

07:10.307 --> 07:12.208
Yeah, thank you.
I agree, actually.

07:12.243 --> 07:13.476
There is kind of a poetry

07:13.511 --> 07:15.712
to the way the numbers line up to the...

07:15.746 --> 07:17.313
the survey stats.

07:17.348 --> 07:18.348
Um... (clears throat)

07:18.382 --> 07:19.549
Art thou, uh, intrigued?

07:19.583 --> 07:20.617
Uh, yes, I am.

07:20.651 --> 07:21.751
Yeah, keep going, Doug.

07:21.785 --> 07:22.752
You're doing great.

07:22.786 --> 07:24.487
Just... carry on.

07:24.522 --> 07:25.922
With pleasure. Yeah.

07:25.956 --> 07:27.891
Uh, well, let's really dig in, then.

07:27.925 --> 07:28.892
Shall we?
Sure.

07:28.926 --> 07:30.460
Yeah. (clears throat)

07:30.494 --> 07:32.028
(quietly):
So, look.

07:32.062 --> 07:34.497
This whole water.org
thing, it's fine.

07:34.532 --> 07:35.732
But, I mean, let's face it,

07:35.766 --> 07:37.901
water is about as unsexy as this guy.

07:37.935 --> 07:38.902
Yeah.

07:38.936 --> 07:40.336
I mean, how many times can I go on TV

07:40.371 --> 07:41.938
and say, "Every 20 seconds,

07:41.972 --> 07:43.606
"a child dies 'cause they lack access
God, yeah.

07:43.641 --> 07:45.742
to clean water and sanitation"?
Clean water and sanitation.

07:45.776 --> 07:47.377
Right. But nobody
ever gives a fuck,

07:47.411 --> 07:48.611
because they're mostly African.

07:48.646 --> 07:50.246
I mean, no offense.

07:50.281 --> 07:51.414
No, that's fine.
I just got to take it

07:51.448 --> 07:53.283
to a different level,
like another place.

07:53.317 --> 07:57.153
I see myself, like,
with a beard, you know?

07:57.188 --> 07:59.355
And, uh, like-like,
maybe an M-16.

07:59.390 --> 08:02.358
And I'm just fucking, like...
I gotta go native, man.

08:02.393 --> 08:04.360
Like, sweat fucking
stains just fucking...

08:04.395 --> 08:05.361
boom.

08:05.396 --> 08:06.763
You're talk--

08:06.797 --> 08:08.798
kind of like Special
Forces in Afghanistan.

08:08.832 --> 08:11.000
That's what I'm talking about. Oh. Yeah.
Exactly. Exactly.

08:11.035 --> 08:12.669
Exactly.
You know that's not a charity.

08:12.703 --> 08:13.970
I...
Per se.

08:14.004 --> 08:15.371
What the fuck do you think
I'm doing here, man?

08:15.406 --> 08:16.573
Absolutely.
That's why I need some help.

08:16.607 --> 08:18.074
I'm just giving you images.

08:18.108 --> 08:19.442
It's a landscape we're talking about.

08:19.476 --> 08:20.577
It's a landscape, right.
Yeah.

08:20.611 --> 08:22.145
We gotta go out, man.

08:22.179 --> 08:23.646
You and me.
We gotta go out.

08:23.681 --> 08:25.081
Fucking we would tear this shit up.

08:25.115 --> 08:26.082
(laughs)
I can tell

08:26.116 --> 08:27.183
just from your story with her.

08:27.218 --> 08:28.785
This shit would be fucking great.

08:28.819 --> 08:30.253
No, we could rage
for sure. Yeah.

08:30.287 --> 08:31.688
Yeah, we could get weird.
Okay.

08:31.722 --> 08:32.989
Let's do it tonight.

08:33.023 --> 08:35.158
I got nothing else going on.
Oh, no, tonight is...

08:35.192 --> 08:36.659
It's gotta be tonight,
'cause I got another thing.

08:36.693 --> 08:38.727
I see what the whole countervailing...

08:38.761 --> 08:40.496
Yeah, the coupling with the, uh,

08:40.530 --> 08:41.798
the positive perceptual
attributes, and...

08:41.832 --> 08:43.600
Brilliant.

08:43.634 --> 08:45.201
...the Damon brand-scape
is born.

08:45.236 --> 08:46.436
Bourne.

08:46.470 --> 08:47.737
Ah!
Like the film franchise, the film franchise

08:47.771 --> 08:49.305
<i>The Bourne Identity.</i>
Yeah, I know, I got it.

08:49.340 --> 08:50.306
We all got the
reference. Good.

08:50.341 --> 08:51.307
MATT: Thank you.
Oh.

08:51.342 --> 08:52.508
Thank you so much.

08:52.543 --> 08:54.177
I'm really impressed
at how-how much you guys

08:54.211 --> 08:55.511
have done in so little time,

08:55.546 --> 08:57.380
and I just need some time
to think about it, meditate,

08:57.414 --> 08:58.381
and, uh...
Smart.

08:58.415 --> 08:59.949
and I'll get back to you. Okay?

08:59.984 --> 09:01.184
Right.
Tonight.

09:01.218 --> 09:02.785
Yeah, Matt. Uh, tonight, I...

09:02.820 --> 09:04.387
See you soon.

09:04.421 --> 09:05.788
And if you don't mind, if I...

09:05.823 --> 09:06.789
Lost him.

09:06.824 --> 09:07.957
What was he saying to you?

09:07.992 --> 09:09.058
I don't know.

09:09.093 --> 09:10.627
He seemed like he was into it.
He did?

09:10.661 --> 09:12.161
Yeah, of course he did.

09:12.196 --> 09:13.830
Yeah, we're gonna
go out tonight, chop it up.

09:13.864 --> 09:15.231
DOUG: All right.
This is kind of like

09:15.266 --> 09:16.666
a club scene, or more
like a fancy dinner?

09:16.700 --> 09:18.468
You're not going.

09:18.502 --> 09:20.503
Doug, of course you're not
going, you fucking idiot.

09:20.537 --> 09:22.472
(laughs) And neither is
the other idiot invited.

09:22.506 --> 09:24.340
I probably won't be able to make
it tonight either, I guess.

09:24.375 --> 09:25.441
Are you free?
I am, yeah.

09:25.476 --> 09:26.676
You want to come?
Yeah.

09:26.710 --> 09:29.345
Tough shit.

09:29.380 --> 09:31.047
I'll be on standby.

09:39.523 --> 09:40.490
JEANNIE:
Hey.

09:40.524 --> 09:42.492
Mini-Marty,
how you doing?

09:42.526 --> 09:43.493
Hey, Jeannie.

09:43.527 --> 09:45.028
Cute kicks. Janowskis?

09:45.062 --> 09:46.629
Yeah, what else?

09:46.664 --> 09:49.766
What grown-up girl knows
Janowskis are Janowskis?

09:49.800 --> 09:51.834
(sighs)
Can you keep a secret?

09:51.869 --> 09:54.504
Probably shouldn't be telling you this.

09:54.538 --> 09:56.506
I am so not a grown-up.

09:59.643 --> 10:02.011
What's that?
Nothing.

10:02.046 --> 10:03.246
What's up, buddy?

10:03.280 --> 10:04.247
Hey, Dad.

10:04.281 --> 10:05.882
Uh...

10:05.916 --> 10:07.483
Listen, about tonight, I...

10:07.518 --> 10:09.585
Yeah, I was hoping you could take maybe

10:09.620 --> 10:11.387
me and Dylan to the batting cages?

10:11.422 --> 10:13.723
The batting cages?

10:13.757 --> 10:15.058
You and Dylan-- who's Dylan?

10:15.092 --> 10:16.659
He's my homeboy, kind of.

10:16.694 --> 10:18.728
He's epically badass.

10:18.762 --> 10:21.364
And he's really into the batting
cages, so I kind of promised

10:21.398 --> 10:23.733
him you'd take us.

10:25.102 --> 10:27.070
Uh, Jeannie?

10:28.305 --> 10:30.106
She's pretty cool, yeah?

10:30.140 --> 10:31.674
Totally.
Yeah.

10:31.709 --> 10:34.377
You know, she's crazy about baseball.

10:34.411 --> 10:36.112
I don't know if you knew that.

10:36.146 --> 10:37.947
You know, I just had a thought.

10:37.981 --> 10:40.883
What if Jeannie took you
and Dylan to the batting cages?

10:40.918 --> 10:43.553
Shut up.
I'm just saying, what if?

10:43.587 --> 10:44.721
Yeah.

10:44.755 --> 10:46.189
You want me to try to hook that up?
Yeah.

10:46.223 --> 10:47.190
(chuckles):
Okay, cool.

10:50.327 --> 10:51.627
I boned your mentor, but, I mean,

10:51.662 --> 10:52.829
you're demoting me to babysitter?

10:52.863 --> 10:54.330
I'm not demoting you to shit.
Fuck you, Marty.

10:54.365 --> 10:56.232
Listen, Jeannie, I had uomething planned

10:56.266 --> 10:58.000
with him, okay, it's a part
of the Damon account.

10:58.035 --> 10:59.802
Now I got to go and hang out
with Matt fucking Damon

10:59.837 --> 11:00.903
to have a boys' night out

11:00.938 --> 11:02.505
to seal the deal.
Oh, you got to hang out?

11:02.539 --> 11:04.607
Matt Damon does not have
boys' nights out, Marty.

11:04.641 --> 11:06.709
You have no idea what kind of a...

11:06.744 --> 11:07.844
No, thank you.

11:07.878 --> 11:10.580
Busy, bye-bye.

11:10.614 --> 11:12.115
500 bucks.
No.

11:12.149 --> 11:14.183
Oh, my God, 500...
fuck you yet again.

11:14.218 --> 11:16.886
I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
princess, two grand.

11:16.920 --> 11:19.389
I... will do it.
Oh!

11:19.423 --> 11:21.824
But it has nothing to do with the money, Marty.
Oh, that's so sweet.

11:21.859 --> 11:23.860
It has to do with the fact that
we need to close the business.

11:23.894 --> 11:25.161
Okay?
I love that you have so much integrity.

11:25.195 --> 11:26.162
Yeah.
You're a team player.

11:26.196 --> 11:27.230
Yeah, I am.

11:27.264 --> 11:29.565
Thank you, Jeannie.
You're welcome.

11:29.600 --> 11:30.566
Cash?

11:30.601 --> 11:32.702
Don't push it.

11:32.736 --> 11:34.737
(low moaning)

11:42.813 --> 11:45.281
(loud moaning)

11:46.817 --> 11:48.818
Ah!

11:48.852 --> 11:51.087
(panting)

11:58.362 --> 12:00.930
Baby?

12:00.964 --> 12:01.931
Hmm, what?

12:01.965 --> 12:03.099
Did you like that?

12:03.133 --> 12:06.035
Mm, are you
kidding me? Yes.

12:06.069 --> 12:08.471
Screaming like a freak, wasn't I?

12:08.505 --> 12:12.074
And then I got sleepy, so just shh

12:12.109 --> 12:15.011
for just a little while, okay?

12:15.045 --> 12:16.412
I'm just gonna take a nap.

12:16.447 --> 12:17.413
Mm.

12:17.448 --> 12:18.915
What's going on?

12:18.949 --> 12:21.884
Nothing, absolutely nothing.

12:21.919 --> 12:23.953
You get what I'm asking though,

12:23.987 --> 12:25.421
right?

12:27.424 --> 12:29.959
Mm... mm-mm? No.

12:29.993 --> 12:33.830
We're in something here,
but you're, like...

12:33.864 --> 12:35.264
not a lesbian.

12:35.299 --> 12:36.966
Tess...

12:38.969 --> 12:40.303
Don't be such a pussy.

12:40.337 --> 12:41.304
(laughs)

12:41.338 --> 12:42.438
I'm serious.

12:42.473 --> 12:44.474
See?
(moans)

12:44.508 --> 12:47.577
You're like a guy.

12:47.611 --> 12:48.744
Mm-hmm.

12:48.779 --> 12:50.680
And you are not like a butch girl.

12:50.714 --> 12:52.315
What do you want me to be?

12:52.349 --> 12:55.585
You want me to be your
humorless lesbian wife?

12:55.619 --> 12:57.820
I just want to take a little nap.

12:57.855 --> 12:59.956
Just a really short nap.

12:59.990 --> 13:01.457
Okay?

13:01.492 --> 13:03.159
A couple minutes or something.

13:03.193 --> 13:05.795
Is Monica sleepy?

13:05.829 --> 13:08.631
Monica's trying to be sleepy but, um...

13:11.802 --> 13:13.970
Monica's getting less sleepy.

13:14.004 --> 13:18.508
How about "hot hookup"

13:18.542 --> 13:20.576
instead of "humorless wife"?

13:20.611 --> 13:22.311
I think I could go for that.
Yeah?

13:22.346 --> 13:24.247
(chuckles)

13:24.281 --> 13:27.149
Yes.
(laughs)

13:27.184 --> 13:30.253
ROSCOE: <i>Dylan's our star pitcher</i>
<i>and he also plays shortstop.</i>

13:30.287 --> 13:31.554
<i>Wait till you see, Jeannie.</i>

13:31.588 --> 13:34.023
<i>He's, like, amazing at baseball.</i>

13:34.057 --> 13:35.558
Come on, guys.

13:39.396 --> 13:41.964
So what are your turn-ons
and turn-offs?

13:41.999 --> 13:43.432
(chuckles):
Excuse me?

13:43.467 --> 13:47.303
Turn-ons: long walks on
the beach, crunk hip-hop beats,

13:47.337 --> 13:48.838
<i>The Great Gatsby.</i>

13:48.872 --> 13:50.640
Turn-offs:

13:50.674 --> 13:52.241
back hair, mullets,

13:52.276 --> 13:54.176
running out of margarita mix.
(laughs)

13:54.211 --> 13:56.078
Did you memorize that?

13:56.113 --> 13:57.146
Miss July.

13:57.180 --> 13:58.814
Mm.
In case I ever

13:58.849 --> 14:01.450
run into her.
Yeah, uh...

14:01.485 --> 14:03.119
I liked <i>The Great Gatsby.</i>

14:03.153 --> 14:04.787
Are we gonna bat or what?

14:07.224 --> 14:08.925
My lady.
(chuckles)

14:11.061 --> 14:12.962
Check it out, Dylan.

14:12.996 --> 14:14.163
I made contact.

14:14.197 --> 14:15.464
Uh-huh.

14:20.704 --> 14:22.204
Dylan.

14:22.239 --> 14:24.006
Forgive me.

14:24.041 --> 14:26.609
But it's like spun gold.
(chuckles)

14:28.078 --> 14:30.646
You... are
really something.

14:30.681 --> 14:32.048
You know, Jeannie,
it's your turn to bat.

14:32.082 --> 14:34.016
Okay, well, wish me luck.

14:34.051 --> 14:36.018
I have not picked up a bat in years.

14:36.053 --> 14:38.487
DYLAN:
You know the drill.

14:38.522 --> 14:40.523
Just breathe.

14:40.557 --> 14:41.791
Breathe, Jeannie.

23:52.842 --> 23:55.544
Hey.

23:55.578 --> 23:56.712
Matt?

23:56.746 --> 23:58.747
(clapping) Matt Damon.

23:58.781 --> 24:00.549
(snoring)

24:02.685 --> 24:03.986
Hey, asshole.
(groans)

24:04.020 --> 24:06.121
Call you back.

24:06.156 --> 24:08.090
You with me? Okay,

24:08.124 --> 24:09.424
are we gonna make this deal

24:09.459 --> 24:10.859
or not?
Huh?

24:10.894 --> 24:12.761
Look at me. Focus.

24:12.795 --> 24:14.062
I see you, okay?

24:14.097 --> 24:16.598
I see the real you.

24:16.633 --> 24:17.766
I know what you want.

24:17.800 --> 24:19.101
I know exactly what you want.

24:19.135 --> 24:21.603
Are you gonna stop fucking
with me and make this deal

24:21.638 --> 24:24.206
or am I gonna keep slapping
the shit out of you?

24:24.240 --> 24:25.541
Which way is it gonna be?

24:26.576 --> 24:29.378
I can't feel my legs.

24:32.582 --> 24:34.483
Can't feel my legs,

24:34.517 --> 24:38.187
but I'm feeling something else.

24:38.221 --> 24:40.088
You want to close the deal, man?

24:40.123 --> 24:42.124
Huh? Come on.

24:42.158 --> 24:45.127
Just... a little
something something.

24:45.161 --> 24:46.929
Just a little.

24:46.963 --> 24:48.530
Yeah, like... (groaning)

24:49.799 --> 24:51.200
Oh, Marty.

24:51.234 --> 24:53.302
(gagging)

24:53.336 --> 24:55.437
Oh, Marty, come on, man.
Fuck.

24:55.471 --> 24:57.472
You're fucking insane.
I'm not, no. Just...

24:57.507 --> 24:59.608
How about we do this?
Stop being all indignant, man.

24:59.642 --> 25:01.476
What's your problem?
Get the fuck out.

25:01.511 --> 25:02.778
Really just talking a little blowy

25:02.812 --> 25:04.413
between buds, man.

25:04.447 --> 25:05.581
Fuck.
Matt Damon,

25:05.615 --> 25:08.083
I'm throwing you out. Go.

25:08.117 --> 25:11.086
You're throwing me out of your building?

25:11.120 --> 25:12.721
Yeah. Get the fuck out.

25:12.755 --> 25:13.956
God. I'm sorry.

25:13.990 --> 25:15.057
I don't know what...

25:15.091 --> 25:17.092
I'm...

25:18.895 --> 25:20.395
I'm sorry.

25:20.430 --> 25:21.964
I'm totally... I don't even...

25:21.998 --> 25:23.932
Jesus, Marty.

25:26.236 --> 25:27.569
Sorry.

25:27.604 --> 25:30.305
I'm so sorry, man.

25:30.340 --> 25:32.441
I-I'm so sorry, man.

25:34.310 --> 25:36.078
(sighs) We could totally close this

25:36.112 --> 25:38.113
with just a hand job.

25:41.384 --> 25:43.385
(helicopter blades whirring)

25:47.223 --> 25:48.690
(woman screaming)

25:48.725 --> 25:50.158
(automatic gunfire)

25:50.193 --> 25:52.194
(people shouting, crying)

25:57.400 --> 25:59.668
(gunfire continues)

25:59.702 --> 26:01.670
(explosion)

26:01.704 --> 26:03.972
(screaming, gunfire continues)

26:04.007 --> 26:05.974
Get those children to safety now!

26:06.009 --> 26:07.843
(explosions)

26:07.877 --> 26:09.678
Move those kids back there!

26:09.712 --> 26:10.946
Sister,

26:10.980 --> 26:12.748
protect this child.

26:12.782 --> 26:14.750
I have work to do.

26:16.319 --> 26:18.387
Don't go back in there, Matt Damon.

26:19.922 --> 26:21.923
(man shouting, gunfire continues)

26:28.264 --> 26:29.831
He'll make a full recovery.

26:29.866 --> 26:33.368
MATT: <i>Obviously, we can't
all be on the front lines</i>

26:33.403 --> 26:35.370
<i>taking on this horrific problem</i>
<i>head-on.</i>

26:35.405 --> 26:37.306
Yeah, that looks right.
Five cc's for all of them.

26:37.340 --> 26:38.540
<i>So what can you do?</i>

26:38.574 --> 26:40.475
<i>Go to damonschildren.org</i>

26:40.510 --> 26:43.145
<i>right now, and become part</i>
<i>of a new kind of army,</i>

26:43.179 --> 26:45.147
<i>one that fights for the kids.</i>

26:56.693 --> 26:59.328
<i>Tell your friends,</i>

26:59.362 --> 27:00.862
<i>tell your family,</i>

27:00.897 --> 27:03.165
<i>damonschildren.org,</i>

27:03.199 --> 27:04.800
<i>because children should be children.</i>

27:04.834 --> 27:06.001
Right, kids?

27:06.035 --> 27:09.838
ALL:
That's right, Matt Damon.

27:09.872 --> 27:11.873
(laughter, excited chatter)

27:21.017 --> 27:22.984
(applause, cheering)

27:23.019 --> 27:24.419
Oh...
MAN: Matt Damon!

27:24.454 --> 27:26.555
(mumbles)
MAN 2: Great job.

27:26.589 --> 27:28.223
Thanks, Steven.

27:28.257 --> 27:30.058
No, you, you.

27:30.093 --> 27:32.594
Yeah, sure, sure.

27:32.628 --> 27:34.162
Thank you.

27:34.197 --> 27:35.397
Great work.

27:35.431 --> 27:37.165
