WEBVTT

00:03.264 --> 00:05.307
FRANK: But of all
the Bureau's divisions

00:05.308 --> 00:08.483
and units that make up the NYPD,

00:09.362 --> 00:11.841
it is Patrol that is

00:11.842 --> 00:13.809
the backbone of this department.

00:13.811 --> 00:16.045
It is Patrol

00:16.047 --> 00:18.681
that has the capacity
to prevent crime

00:18.683 --> 00:20.449
before it happens.

00:20.451 --> 00:24.086
To steer Johnny Misdemeanor
from becoming Johnny Felony

00:24.088 --> 00:26.922
before it's too late.

00:26.924 --> 00:28.991
Thank you

00:28.993 --> 00:31.860
for your most important work.

00:31.862 --> 00:34.830
Officer Jill Carpenter,
please step forward.

00:37.468 --> 00:39.468
Yes, sir.

00:39.470 --> 00:40.669
Three felony collars,

00:40.671 --> 00:43.305
a successful negotiation
in a hostage situation

00:43.307 --> 00:44.940
and coaching

00:44.942 --> 00:47.910
your eighth grade
girls basketball team

00:47.912 --> 00:50.613
to the division championship,
all in the last few weeks.

00:50.615 --> 00:52.448
Just doing my job, sir.

00:52.450 --> 00:55.184
Any of you get the chance,
buy this officer a beer.

00:55.186 --> 00:57.853
Off duty, that is.

00:57.855 --> 00:59.221
That's an order.

00:59.223 --> 01:00.889
OFFICERS:
Yes, sir!

01:00.891 --> 01:03.492
Do good work.

01:03.494 --> 01:06.295
Come back safe.

01:06.297 --> 01:08.263
Sergeant Renzulli.

01:08.265 --> 01:10.599
Roll call dismissed.

01:12.000 --> 01:18.074
Advertise your product or brand here

01:28.853 --> 01:30.786
How'd I do?

01:30.788 --> 01:31.887
Best one yet.

01:31.889 --> 01:33.022
What's up?

01:33.024 --> 01:34.657
It's about Officer Carpenter.

01:34.659 --> 01:36.625
Her dad was Boston PD.

01:36.627 --> 01:38.930
And killed in the line of duty
last month. I know.

01:38.931 --> 01:39.545
Oh.

01:39.569 --> 01:41.831
That's part of the reason
for the "attaboy" in there.

01:42.533 --> 01:44.466
She wants to ask you a favor.

01:44.468 --> 01:46.135
She came to me about it first.

01:46.137 --> 01:47.536
A favor she needs vetted?

01:47.538 --> 01:48.871
No, not that she knows.

01:48.873 --> 01:50.472
Well, what is it?

01:50.474 --> 01:52.141
She wants her late dad's
shield number.

01:52.143 --> 01:53.742
It's retired in the NYPD.

01:53.744 --> 01:55.244
That's not impossible.

01:55.246 --> 01:59.148
It's 46808.

02:06.524 --> 02:09.058
I see.

02:14.398 --> 02:18.133
What do you want to do?

02:19.570 --> 02:22.371
I don't know.

02:23.941 --> 02:26.208
I can handle it.
Hold it off for a while.

02:27.011 --> 02:29.712
Thank you.

02:32.416 --> 02:34.083
(sighs)

02:36.587 --> 02:38.754
(sighs heavily)

02:41.859 --> 02:43.759
JANKO: So that's where last
night's victim was slashed.

02:43.761 --> 02:46.061
68 years old, returning
from her midnight shift.

02:46.063 --> 02:48.330
Perp came out of the dark,
demanded her purse,

02:48.332 --> 02:50.199
apparently she was
too slow giving it up.

02:50.201 --> 02:51.533
And this guy's
struck before?

02:51.535 --> 02:53.202
Yeah. Three times
in the last month,

02:53.204 --> 02:55.204
but this is the second
time he's cut his victim.

02:55.206 --> 02:55.959
Charming.

02:55.983 --> 02:58.258
Residents have been demanding
foot patrols for weeks.

02:58.576 --> 03:01.276
Here we are,
to protect and serve.

03:03.314 --> 03:07.182
Hey, partner, tell me
that's not our guy.

03:08.953 --> 03:10.385
Sure is acting like it.

03:10.387 --> 03:11.587
Excuse me!

03:13.491 --> 03:14.556
Hey! Police! Hold
it right there!

03:14.558 --> 03:15.791
Move!
Oh!

03:15.793 --> 03:16.859
JANKO:
Police!

03:16.861 --> 03:19.061
JAMIE: Stop! Police!

03:20.664 --> 03:21.997
Police! Give it up!

03:26.470 --> 03:28.203
Hey! Get back! Get back!

03:28.205 --> 03:29.571
JANKO: Leave now!

03:56.700 --> 03:59.101
Police! Don't move!

03:59.103 --> 04:00.102
(grunts)

04:00.104 --> 04:01.837
Jamie, he's coming
your way!

04:03.507 --> 04:04.473
(grunting)

04:04.475 --> 04:05.474
Leave me alone!

04:05.476 --> 04:07.276
I didn't do anything!

04:07.278 --> 04:09.244
You knocked that lady down.
That's assault.

04:11.916 --> 04:14.683
One crack pipe with residue.
Other side.

04:19.089 --> 04:20.255
That's the ball game.
Nice.

04:20.257 --> 04:21.490
Here you go.

04:21.492 --> 04:23.926
(sirens approaching)

04:23.928 --> 04:25.240
You're getting up.
Get on your knees first.

04:25.264 --> 04:26.963
On your knees. (grunts)

04:26.964 --> 04:28.430
On your feet.

04:28.432 --> 04:29.998
Let's go.

04:30.801 --> 04:32.734
That was fast, Detectives.

04:32.736 --> 04:34.503
Job came over the air
not five minutes ago.

04:34.505 --> 04:36.104
We were out to meal
three blocks over.

04:36.106 --> 04:37.472
Didn't even get
a chance to order.

04:37.474 --> 04:39.241
Yeah, lucky us.

04:41.312 --> 04:43.679
Son of a bitch.
That's John Vinchetti Jr.

04:43.681 --> 04:45.180
BAEZ:
Of <i> the</i> Vinchettis?

04:45.182 --> 04:46.481
Yeah.
I thought they went out of business

04:46.483 --> 04:48.350
after Vinchetti Sr. croaked.

04:48.352 --> 04:50.185
Gangsters are like cockroaches.

04:50.187 --> 04:51.820
They'll always be around?

04:51.822 --> 04:54.323
And it's always fun to see one
of them get stomped out.

04:54.325 --> 04:56.225
Keys are still in the ignition.

04:56.227 --> 04:59.228
I'm not seeing any shell casings
or surveillance cameras.

04:59.230 --> 05:00.929
No bystanders either.

05:00.931 --> 05:02.264
Where the hell
is the driver?

05:02.266 --> 05:03.565
Do you smell that?

05:03.567 --> 05:05.067
No, I don't smell anything.

05:05.069 --> 05:06.068
Smells like pee.

05:06.070 --> 05:07.369
Pop the trunk.

05:10.307 --> 05:12.274
What...?
(grunts weakly)

05:13.477 --> 05:15.110
We found the driver.

05:17.948 --> 05:19.581
And hopefully a lead.

Right in here, Mr. Russo.

05:52.176 --> 05:53.876
These the only pants you got?

05:53.878 --> 05:55.511
At least they're dry.

05:55.513 --> 05:58.013
Look, if you talk
to anyone else in my crew,

05:58.015 --> 05:59.448
they don't need
to know...

05:59.450 --> 06:01.450
That you failed
to protect the boss

06:01.452 --> 06:04.019
or that you peed yourself while
failing to protect the boss?

06:04.021 --> 06:05.421
Go to hell.

06:05.423 --> 06:07.256
That's where your boss is now.

06:07.258 --> 06:09.992
Come on. Take a seat
and tell us all about it.

06:09.994 --> 06:13.262
Come on. Sit down.

06:13.264 --> 06:16.031
Boss just had lunch
at Tuscany Tavern,

06:16.033 --> 06:17.733
I'm driving him back,

06:17.735 --> 06:20.502
and some hump on a motorcycle
comes out of nowhere

06:20.504 --> 06:21.837
and cuts me off.

06:21.839 --> 06:24.206
Describe him.

06:24.208 --> 06:26.575
Oh, I don't know.
It was a hump on a motorcycle.

06:26.577 --> 06:29.511
I couldn't see his face
through the helmet.

06:29.513 --> 06:32.248
I yelled,
"Hey, you got a problem?"

06:32.250 --> 06:35.417
But he's already off
his bike. So I get out,

06:35.419 --> 06:38.621
and suddenly he pulls a gun
and hits me in the face.

06:38.623 --> 06:41.023
I go down.

06:41.025 --> 06:45.027
Then... I hear a shot,

06:45.029 --> 06:47.963
and John Jr. screams.

06:47.965 --> 06:49.598
(sighs)

06:49.600 --> 06:52.201
God rest his soul.

06:53.070 --> 06:53.936
Sounds like a hit.

06:53.938 --> 06:55.271
You think?

06:55.273 --> 06:56.538
(sighs)

06:56.540 --> 06:58.874
Who do you think would want
to kill your boss, Ronnie?

06:58.876 --> 07:00.309
One of the other families.

07:00.311 --> 07:03.612
Vinchettis got juice,
so they come after us.

07:03.614 --> 07:04.546
"Us"?

07:04.548 --> 07:06.215
Since when did it become "us"?

07:06.217 --> 07:07.816
I mean,
the shooter didn't even think

07:07.818 --> 07:09.952
you were worth wasting
a bullet on.

07:09.954 --> 07:12.121
Hey, that ain't why I'm alive.

07:12.123 --> 07:13.622
So you fought him off?

07:13.624 --> 07:14.924
W... (stammers)

07:14.926 --> 07:17.860
No. But after he shot John,

07:17.862 --> 07:20.329
he turns back and says,
"Tell the rest of 'em

07:20.331 --> 07:22.498
this is only the beginning."

07:22.500 --> 07:25.467
Then he clocks me again.

07:25.469 --> 07:27.436
(sighs) Next thing I know,

07:27.438 --> 07:30.239
I'm waking up
when you two opened the trunk.

07:30.241 --> 07:31.840
Soaked in pee.

07:31.842 --> 07:33.008
Yeah. Soaked in pee.

07:33.010 --> 07:35.444
Can I go now?
I told you everything.

07:35.446 --> 07:36.645
Well, Ronnie, you can go,

07:36.647 --> 07:39.615
but, uh, you're gonna work
for us now.

07:39.617 --> 07:40.649
What?

07:40.651 --> 07:42.017
You're gonna go back
to your crew.

07:42.019 --> 07:43.218
They're gonna decide
who they're gonna whack

07:43.220 --> 07:44.920
in retaliation
for killing the boss,

07:44.922 --> 07:46.555
and you're gonna call us
and let us know.

07:46.557 --> 07:49.491
My guys will cut me to pieces
if they find out.

07:49.493 --> 07:51.860
Same thing they'll do if we put
word out you found God

07:51.862 --> 07:54.697
in that trunk and decided
to flip on every one of 'em.

07:54.699 --> 07:56.966
You wouldn't do that.

07:56.968 --> 07:59.168
You think?

08:10.881 --> 08:12.448
Here you go, boss.

08:12.450 --> 08:15.284
Suspect in the Parksdale
Projects knifepoint robberies.

08:15.286 --> 08:17.353
What's your name?
Derek Gibbs.

08:17.355 --> 08:18.620
But I didn't rob anyone.

08:18.622 --> 08:21.724
I only had it to protect myself
from whoever is doing it.

08:21.726 --> 08:24.159
Also found on his person:
one crack pipe with residue,

08:24.161 --> 08:27.262
one ChapStick, and a, uh, wallet

08:27.264 --> 08:30.032
containing
exactly three dollars.

08:30.034 --> 08:32.201
Hey, Reagan.

08:36.807 --> 08:38.640
What's going on?

08:38.642 --> 08:40.642
Think we got the guy terrorizing
the Parksdale Projects.

08:40.644 --> 08:41.844
Take a look.

08:41.846 --> 08:43.479
Yeah?
Yeah, see?

08:45.149 --> 08:47.016
I guess so.

08:47.018 --> 08:48.450
Maybe.

08:48.452 --> 08:49.685
He also ran
when we approached him,

08:49.687 --> 08:51.153
and we found a knife
in his jacket.

08:51.155 --> 08:52.054
How big is the blade?

08:52.056 --> 08:52.921
About three inches.

08:52.923 --> 08:54.390
Technically, not illegal.

08:54.392 --> 08:55.557
Still a knife.

08:55.559 --> 08:57.259
I just hope you're not wasting
your time.

08:57.261 --> 08:58.627
A lineup will decide that.

08:58.629 --> 09:00.496
And if the real perp strikes
in your sector

09:00.498 --> 09:02.058
while you're here doing
the paperwork...

09:03.801 --> 09:05.901
Boss, you're making it sound
like it's a bad collar.

09:05.903 --> 09:07.403
No, no. I mean, it's...

09:07.405 --> 09:10.873
If you're happy with it,
go with God.

09:16.080 --> 09:17.780
What was that about?

09:17.782 --> 09:19.982
Beats the hell out of me.

09:22.153 --> 09:24.153
Look, I need my pants back.
Where are they?

09:24.155 --> 09:25.854
In the trash.
What?

09:25.856 --> 09:27.790
Those are $100 slacks.

09:27.792 --> 09:29.158
Yeah, that nobody's worn
since the '80s.

09:29.160 --> 09:30.325
You'll get over it.

09:30.327 --> 09:32.728
You done harassing him?

09:32.730 --> 09:34.596
Sal Vinchetti. And company.

09:34.598 --> 09:37.132
Right on cue.
Always a pleasure seeing you,

09:37.134 --> 09:38.767
Detective Reagan.

09:38.769 --> 09:41.203
Now that we've gotten the lies
over with, go on, Ronnie,

09:41.205 --> 09:44.073
tell your boss how you kept
your mouth shut like a good boy.

09:46.811 --> 09:48.777
They do this to you?

09:48.779 --> 09:51.046
No, Sal. It's-it's fine.
Huh?

09:51.048 --> 09:53.348
Congratulations,
by the way, Sal.

09:53.350 --> 09:55.384
Congratulations?

09:55.386 --> 09:57.386
My brother's dead.

09:57.388 --> 09:58.554
Well, now you're the head
of the family.

09:58.556 --> 09:59.922
So, congratulations.

09:59.924 --> 10:02.124
This isn't the time to be
thinking about things like that.

10:02.126 --> 10:03.125
Or to shoot up half the city

10:03.127 --> 10:04.626
trying to find
whoever killed him.

10:04.628 --> 10:07.329
Shooting up the city
is what the cops do these days.

10:07.331 --> 10:09.131
Only when there's
bad guys around.

10:09.133 --> 10:11.300
Come on, Ronnie.

10:16.073 --> 10:18.674
You think Ronnie will really
call us before they retaliate?

10:18.676 --> 10:20.209
I hope so.

10:20.211 --> 10:22.478
Last thing we need
is a Mob war.

10:35.793 --> 10:37.659
GARRETT:
Three times in six years.

10:37.661 --> 10:39.895
That's about what I thought.

10:39.897 --> 10:41.697
And in each instance
it was either

10:41.699 --> 10:43.732
the son of a slain officer

10:43.734 --> 10:45.534
or someone close to his family,

10:45.536 --> 10:48.003
and the family
made the request to you

10:48.005 --> 10:49.805
to unretire the shield number.

10:49.807 --> 10:52.107
So it's not policy
but certainly tradition.

10:52.109 --> 10:54.843
Officer Carpenter
was obviously not family,

10:54.845 --> 10:57.646
and her late father
was not NYPD.

10:57.648 --> 10:59.214
Her request has no precedent.

10:59.216 --> 11:01.817
You are under no obligation
to entertain it.

11:01.819 --> 11:03.218
Oh, certainly I am, Garrett.

11:03.220 --> 11:05.087
She's a cop who lost her dad.

11:05.089 --> 11:06.421
She wants to honor him.

11:06.423 --> 11:08.090
You think she knows
the number she's asking for

11:08.092 --> 11:10.359
belonged to your son?

11:15.232 --> 11:17.232
Jamie might've said something.

11:17.234 --> 11:19.935
Uh, Jamie wouldn't offer that up
before telling me.

11:19.937 --> 11:21.703
She didn't know
what she's asking for.

11:21.705 --> 11:23.205
What do you want to do?

11:23.207 --> 11:26.208
It's not just what I want to do.
Joe had a grandfather

11:26.210 --> 11:29.778
and brothers and a sister,
nephews and a niece.

11:29.780 --> 11:32.447
Or it can just go away.

11:32.449 --> 11:33.682
It can't.

11:33.684 --> 11:35.584
And it shouldn't.

11:39.190 --> 11:41.690
There's something else.
Take a look at this.

11:41.692 --> 11:45.394
I got curious
who had Joe's shield number

11:45.396 --> 11:49.364
before he did. That's every cop
who had shield number 46808.

11:49.366 --> 11:52.734
And 468 and 46.

11:52.736 --> 11:54.703
Failed liver transplant...

11:54.705 --> 11:56.271
racketeering conviction...

11:56.273 --> 11:57.873
suicide-- what are you saying?

11:57.875 --> 11:58.800
I don't know.

11:58.824 --> 12:00.443
These guys were
not accountants,

12:00.444 --> 12:04.046
they were cops-- they lived
dangerous, stressful lives.

12:08.219 --> 12:11.086
You think the shield number's
some kind of bad omen?

12:11.088 --> 12:13.689
That's 38 cops.

12:13.691 --> 12:16.925
Not a single one of 'em
retired to Florida or a lake

12:16.927 --> 12:20.796
or grew old with
their grandkids or whatever.

12:20.798 --> 12:23.398
And that's a fact.

12:33.277 --> 12:34.810
JANKO:
Derek's paperwork.

12:34.812 --> 12:36.712
And his criminal
history here.

12:36.714 --> 12:38.180
Assortment drug-related charges

12:38.182 --> 12:40.382
going back over two decades,
court-ordered rehabs...

12:40.384 --> 12:42.451
So why would Renzulli
want him cut loose?

12:42.453 --> 12:44.453
Has he ever butt in
on a collar before?

12:44.455 --> 12:46.555
Not even as my training officer.

12:46.557 --> 12:47.823
And more than that,
we're friends;

12:47.825 --> 12:49.691
we've... been through
a lot together.

12:49.693 --> 12:52.060
Are you pining after him?

12:52.062 --> 12:53.895
Wait, you don't think he's
a better partner than me.

12:53.897 --> 12:56.098
Cut it out, Eddie.
(chuckles)

13:00.304 --> 13:01.436
Where's Derek?
I don't know.

13:01.438 --> 13:03.071
I just checked on
him an hour ago,

13:03.073 --> 13:05.207
he was in here with
these same guys.

13:05.209 --> 13:07.876
He isn't ready to go
to Central Booking yet.

13:07.878 --> 13:10.522
Hey, boss, Derek Gibbs
isn't in his cell.

13:10.546 --> 13:11.547
I cut him loose.

13:11.548 --> 13:12.436
Why?

13:12.460 --> 13:13.516
C.O. called,
said to give the guy

13:13.517 --> 13:15.751
a desk ticket and let him go.

13:17.488 --> 13:19.021
Renzulli?

13:19.023 --> 13:21.523
Yeah, it's got to be.

13:26.096 --> 13:28.597
M.E.'s office confirms
John Vinchetti, Jr.

13:28.599 --> 13:31.033
was killed by a single gunshot
wound to the heart.

13:31.035 --> 13:32.534
Oh, didn't know
he had one.

13:32.536 --> 13:34.303
Anything from the red light
cameras?

13:34.305 --> 13:37.306
Negative on the cameras,
but a lady said a guy on a bike

13:37.308 --> 13:39.107
almost ran her over a few blocks
from our crime scene.

13:39.109 --> 13:40.275
Great.

13:40.277 --> 13:42.477
She able to give a better
description than Ronnie?

13:42.479 --> 13:44.946
No, but she did catch a
couple letters off the plate.

13:44.948 --> 13:48.417
I'll request a lawman search and
see if DCPI can ask local news

13:48.419 --> 13:50.285
to mention it.
Great.

13:50.287 --> 13:52.421
You hear anything from Ronnie yet?
No, but I'm sure that clown

13:52.423 --> 13:53.855
got back with those other
Vinchetti clowns

13:53.857 --> 13:55.357
and now they're all
trying to figure out

13:55.359 --> 13:56.925
(phone ringing)
who the hell took out John Jr.

13:56.927 --> 13:58.293
Reagan.

13:59.229 --> 14:00.829
Yeah.

14:03.701 --> 14:05.033
(sighs)

14:05.035 --> 14:06.268
Yeah.

14:06.270 --> 14:08.203
We're on our way.

14:08.205 --> 14:09.771
Not our clown?

14:09.773 --> 14:12.274
No, it was a guy
from the 4th Squad saying that

14:12.276 --> 14:13.608
two of Vinchetti's foot soldiers

14:13.610 --> 14:16.411
just dropped by the Choy Lung
Restaurant in Chinatown.

14:16.413 --> 14:17.979
That's Black Lotus Boys turf.

14:17.981 --> 14:19.915
They shot up the place,
talking about payback.

14:19.917 --> 14:22.617
Now both Vinchettis are dead,
three Black Lotus guys are dead

14:22.619 --> 14:25.387
and four innocent
bystanders on top of that.

14:25.389 --> 14:27.723
And now we have our Mob war.
(Danny sighs)

14:41.746 --> 14:43.746
HENRY:
Well, I slept on it.

14:43.748 --> 14:45.214
Or tried to.

14:45.216 --> 14:47.249
What do you mean?

14:47.251 --> 14:50.987
All night-- television on,
television off,

14:50.989 --> 14:53.456
then all-news radio...

14:53.458 --> 14:55.725
Even the Dustbuster?

14:55.727 --> 14:58.327
Sorry.

14:58.329 --> 15:00.296
Anyway...

15:00.298 --> 15:02.465
what sleep
I could get,

15:02.467 --> 15:06.202
I don't think you should
reinstate Joe's shield number.

15:06.204 --> 15:08.204
That was my first reaction.

15:08.206 --> 15:10.406
You had a second reaction?

15:11.642 --> 15:15.311
Jill Carpenter's a good cop,
her dad's a hero.

15:15.313 --> 15:17.947
Honestly?

15:17.949 --> 15:19.582
I think Joe would be for it.

15:19.584 --> 15:21.417
So why couldn't you sleep?

15:26.157 --> 15:28.891
You think there can be
such a thing as a curse?

15:28.893 --> 15:31.027
Like voodoo or something?
No, uh...

15:31.029 --> 15:33.496
it's like superstition.

15:33.498 --> 15:36.799
This cop in Boston and Joe
had the same shield number.

15:36.801 --> 15:38.868
This cop in Boston and Joe

15:38.870 --> 15:41.103
both get killed
in the line of duty.

15:42.840 --> 15:44.373
And there's more.

15:44.375 --> 15:45.474
I know.

15:45.476 --> 15:47.076
What do you mean, you know?

15:47.078 --> 15:49.945
In March, 1954,

15:49.947 --> 15:51.914
Officer Walter Neff,

15:51.916 --> 15:54.216
two days out of the academy

15:54.218 --> 15:57.887
and wearing shield 468,

15:57.889 --> 15:59.588
was hit by a bus

15:59.590 --> 16:02.191
while he was directing
traffic at an intersection

16:02.193 --> 16:04.827
on the Grand Concourse.

16:04.829 --> 16:06.262
Hit by a bus.

16:06.264 --> 16:08.097
I know.
<i>You</i> know?

16:08.099 --> 16:11.434
Yeah. How do <i> you</i> know?

16:15.339 --> 16:19.008
Well, I guess it's only natural.

16:19.010 --> 16:20.476
A tragedy like we had,

16:20.478 --> 16:22.411
you have to look for some
kind of explanation.

16:22.413 --> 16:23.746
Yeah, but...

16:23.748 --> 16:26.749
hit by a bus-- I mean,
that's supposed to be, you know,

16:26.751 --> 16:30.019
like, a metaphor.
You actually get hit by a bus,

16:30.021 --> 16:32.788
it mean things
are lined up against you.

16:32.790 --> 16:34.356
I'm just saying.

16:34.358 --> 16:37.693
Anyone else know
you're digging around in this?

16:37.695 --> 16:39.028
Garrett.

16:39.030 --> 16:41.530
Well, let's stop it right there.

16:41.532 --> 16:44.934
There's no good for us,
this gets out.

16:44.936 --> 16:46.402
I mean,
it makes us look

16:46.404 --> 16:49.171
less than completely reliable.

16:49.173 --> 16:51.807
Copy that.

16:51.809 --> 16:54.510
But there's no
ignoring the facts.

16:54.512 --> 16:56.779
Do you still carry around
that silver dollar

16:56.781 --> 16:58.414
you had when you were
on the street?

16:58.416 --> 16:59.512
Yeah.

16:59.536 --> 17:01.251
Why do you still
carry it around?

17:01.252 --> 17:03.886
I mean, it's not like you're
going back on the street.

17:05.089 --> 17:06.722
I don't know.

17:06.723 --> 17:08.991
Maybe if I get to travel,

17:08.992 --> 17:12.328
I'm in a neighborhood I don't
know, in a city I don't know.

17:13.006 --> 17:15.807
But it's not a fact
that it would keep you safe.

17:15.809 --> 17:17.108
Or ever did.

17:17.109 --> 17:20.011
Right.

17:20.012 --> 17:23.347
But it did.

17:23.348 --> 17:24.348
(wry chuckle)

17:24.349 --> 17:25.550
Right.

17:28.387 --> 17:30.588
So, what do you want to do?

17:32.025 --> 17:34.926
I think we should
put it before the family.

17:34.928 --> 17:37.128
Without prejudice.

17:42.535 --> 17:45.303
(indistinct conversation)

17:47.807 --> 17:50.641
Hey, Sarge, I don't get it.

17:50.643 --> 17:53.311
You went to the C.O. last night
and got our collar cut loose?

17:53.313 --> 17:55.112
Yeah, just doing my job.

17:55.114 --> 17:56.514
By going behind our backs?

17:56.516 --> 17:58.382
By keeping my officers
from making useless arrests.

17:58.384 --> 18:00.017
I tried telling you this
yesterday,

18:00.019 --> 18:01.252
but you wouldn't listen.

18:01.254 --> 18:03.921
I used the professional judgment
that you instilled in me.

18:05.391 --> 18:06.591
Look, Sarge,

18:06.593 --> 18:08.993
I known you a long time,
you back me up

18:08.995 --> 18:10.394
day in and day out.

18:10.396 --> 18:12.163
But this just looks like
you cut a guy loose

18:12.165 --> 18:14.085
who's been robbing
and stabbing people for weeks.

18:17.770 --> 18:18.803
Am I missing something here?

18:18.805 --> 18:22.073
Hey, Reagan, we both
got jobs to do.

18:22.075 --> 18:24.375
The next time
you question mine--

18:24.377 --> 18:25.810
friend or no friend--

18:25.812 --> 18:28.012
expect to get a rip.

18:31.284 --> 18:35.019
You got no right dragging
me in here like this.

18:35.021 --> 18:37.321
Well, two of your goons went out
seeking revenge last night.

18:37.323 --> 18:39.323
They were dumb enough
to get themselves killed.

18:39.325 --> 18:42.059
I figured I ought to talk to the
guy who ordered them to do it.

18:42.061 --> 18:43.027
Which isn't me.

18:43.029 --> 18:44.161
You're the new boss, Sal.

18:44.163 --> 18:45.129
And all I did last night

18:45.131 --> 18:46.564
was send my guys home early.

18:46.566 --> 18:48.733
You want me to believe
that for the first time

18:48.735 --> 18:51.335
in all of Mob history,
a crew didn't get together

18:51.337 --> 18:53.804
and try to figure out who killed
their boss-- your brother?

18:53.806 --> 18:55.907
I don't know what they did
after they left, okay?

18:55.909 --> 18:59.810
I was busy taking care
of John Jr.'s wife and kids.

18:59.812 --> 19:01.779
We got a funeral to plan.

19:01.781 --> 19:03.547
Is that okay with you?

19:04.484 --> 19:07.018
Look, someone
put it in your crew's head

19:07.020 --> 19:09.053
that the Black Lotus Boys
are the reason

19:09.055 --> 19:10.821
you're buying a coffin
right now.

19:14.827 --> 19:16.827
You think <i> we</i> killed John Jr.?

19:16.829 --> 19:18.596
The Vinchettis
clearly do.

19:18.598 --> 19:20.698
And your men sure pulled out
their guns pretty fast

19:20.700 --> 19:22.400
when they busted
through the door.

19:22.402 --> 19:24.035
What were they supposed to do,

19:24.037 --> 19:26.570
let a bunch of crazed
Italians mow 'em down?

19:26.572 --> 19:29.440
Besides, there were
innocent people in there.

19:29.442 --> 19:33.144
Because the Black Lotus is just
a benign civic organization

19:33.146 --> 19:34.979
protecting the local community.

19:34.981 --> 19:37.114
You think otherwise, prove it.

19:37.116 --> 19:39.684
So no beef with the Vinchettis?

19:39.686 --> 19:41.652
I didn't even know
they were still around.

19:41.654 --> 19:44.221
But since they just
iced a couple of your people,

19:44.223 --> 19:46.057
time to repay the favor, right?

19:46.059 --> 19:47.758
(chuckles)

19:47.760 --> 19:49.327
What year do you think this is?

19:49.329 --> 19:51.595
Do you think we're gonna
come out of our opium dens

19:51.597 --> 19:53.264
with our Tommy guns?

19:55.101 --> 19:56.400
It's a new day, Detective.

19:56.402 --> 19:59.270
If the Black Lotus has a problem
with some other group,

19:59.272 --> 20:01.772
we rely on cooperation,

20:01.774 --> 20:04.575
not violence.

20:09.382 --> 20:11.949
Sal says he's innocent,
of course.

20:11.951 --> 20:14.018
(chuckles):
Though I almost believe him.

20:14.020 --> 20:15.519
BAEZ: Yeah, same
with my guy,

20:15.521 --> 20:17.822
until he decides to even
the score, or some other family

20:17.824 --> 20:20.725
smells blood in the water
and makes their own move.

20:20.727 --> 20:21.892
What do you want me
to do with these two?

20:21.894 --> 20:24.128
Cut those two loose,
call OCCB,

20:24.130 --> 20:26.764
see if they can help us keep
peace between the families.

20:26.766 --> 20:27.798
Where you going?

20:27.800 --> 20:29.934
I gotta make a house call.

20:29.936 --> 20:31.869
Reagan, he's
hiding something.

20:31.871 --> 20:34.538
I know. I just
don't know what.

20:34.540 --> 20:37.008
Well... I asked around,
and it turns out

20:37.010 --> 20:40.344
that Renzulli's intervened
on Derek's behalf before.

20:40.346 --> 20:41.479
He got him cut loose

20:41.481 --> 20:43.147
on two collars
prior to yesterday.

20:43.149 --> 20:45.082
Are you serious?
Hey, it wouldn't be the first time

20:45.084 --> 20:46.584
a cop got in bed
with a crook.

20:46.586 --> 20:48.953
Renzulli's a lot of things,
but he's not dirty.

20:48.955 --> 20:51.288
And you know this... how?

20:51.290 --> 20:53.491
Because I know him.

20:53.493 --> 20:55.926
Which is why I want to find out
what's really going on.

20:56.763 --> 20:58.429
I say we notify IAB.

20:58.431 --> 21:00.264
We don't need

21:00.266 --> 21:02.333
We should at least file
a grievance with the union.

21:02.335 --> 21:04.268
Enough, Janko. Please.

21:04.270 --> 21:06.170

I'm giving him

the benefit of the doubt,
same as I'd do for you.

21:08.574 --> 21:10.041
Except I'm your partner.

21:10.043 --> 21:13.244
We'll just go find Derek and see
what he's got to say about this.

Sal was telling us all to get out.
Right, and you all

the Black Lotus, Ronnie.

in a trunk.

the other guy, I took off.

You're saying the <i> driver</i>

25:46.018 --> 25:47.518

The courier company I work for
makes us all wear cameras

25:50.122 --> 25:52.089

26:22.054 --> 26:23.420
That son of a bitch
played us.

26:23.422 --> 26:24.555
He staged the whole
freakin' thing.

26:24.557 --> 26:26.290
He even peed his pants to sell it.
Well...

26:26.292 --> 26:27.825
why would Ronnie
kill John Jr.

26:27.827 --> 26:30.060
and then start a war
offing his own people?

26:30.062 --> 26:31.662
He better hope
we find out

26:31.664 --> 26:33.130
before the
Vinchetti family does.

26:33.132 --> 26:35.399

Come on, Ronnie, pick up.

26:35.401 --> 26:37.901
RECORDED VOICE: We're sorry,
you have reached a number

26:37.903 --> 26:40.904
that has been disconnected
or is no longer in service.

26:51.234 --> 26:52.993
She wants Joe's shield number?

26:53.017 --> 26:56.661
Her father was killed
in the line of duty in Boston.

26:56.761 --> 26:58.661
He had the same
shield number as Joe.

26:58.663 --> 27:00.727
She wants to wear it
out of respect.

27:00.728 --> 27:02.194
She's a solid cop.

27:02.196 --> 27:03.729
And she doesn't
know it was Joe's.

27:03.731 --> 27:04.997
So what's the question?

27:04.999 --> 27:07.165
It's customary
when a number is retired

27:07.167 --> 27:09.868
for the family to rule
on any request

27:09.870 --> 27:12.771
to return that number
to active duty.

27:12.773 --> 27:14.673
What we should ask ourselves is:

27:14.675 --> 27:16.675
what would Joe do?

27:16.677 --> 27:17.542
That, too.

27:17.544 --> 27:18.477
First he'd ask

27:18.479 --> 27:19.845
why <i> you</i> didn't want it.

27:19.847 --> 27:22.414
I thought long and hard
about that.

27:22.416 --> 27:23.949
And you never really said.

27:23.951 --> 27:26.151
No, I didn't.
You ever plan

27:26.153 --> 27:27.352
on really saying?

27:27.354 --> 27:30.355
What happened to Joe
is part of why I became a cop.

27:30.357 --> 27:32.424
But when I was thinking
about taking

27:32.426 --> 27:33.825
his shield number...

27:33.827 --> 27:36.561
I was watching TV
and <i> Saving Private Ryan</i> came on,

27:36.563 --> 27:38.597
and in my head I was going:

27:38.599 --> 27:41.566
"Ryan, Reagan, Ryan, Reagan."

27:41.568 --> 27:44.636
So you got superstitious.

27:44.638 --> 27:46.104
JAMIE: I don't know,
I guess it seemed

27:46.106 --> 27:48.106
like a sign,
it coming on at that time.

27:48.108 --> 27:49.708
So I decided to honor Joe by:

27:49.710 --> 27:51.777
A) being the best cop
I could be,

27:51.779 --> 27:54.446
and B) driving
his cherry '71 Chevelle SS.

27:54.448 --> 27:55.414
Didn't you crash that?

27:55.416 --> 27:58.150
Yeah, after someone cut
the brake lines.

27:58.152 --> 27:59.951
So there's no curse in that.

27:59.953 --> 28:01.753
Who said anything
about cursed?

28:01.755 --> 28:04.056
Nobody. Nobody.

28:04.858 --> 28:05.957
Figure of speech.

28:05.959 --> 28:08.627
So, if Joe were here
and we could ask him:

28:08.629 --> 28:11.596
is it okay that this officer
takes his shield number?

28:11.598 --> 28:13.632
That's the question.

28:13.634 --> 28:15.667
Okay.

28:15.669 --> 28:17.769
All in favor of releasing

28:17.771 --> 28:20.906
NYPD shield number 46808

28:20.908 --> 28:24.309
for Officer Jill Carpenter
in the 12th Precinct?

28:26.046 --> 28:27.612
He would be for it.

28:27.614 --> 28:28.880
You think?

28:28.882 --> 28:30.715
I do.

28:30.717 --> 28:31.917
Me, too.

28:31.919 --> 28:36.088
I guess if it was for a cop
to honor their father...

28:36.957 --> 28:38.990
...he'd say yeah.

28:40.561 --> 28:42.227

30:41.114 --> 30:42.581
so he didn't have to
hear his grumbling.

30:42.583 --> 30:45.884
It only got worse
when my old man died

30:45.886 --> 30:48.320
and John Jr. was made boss
at age 33.

30:48.322 --> 30:50.222
So why didn't you
just whack him?

30:50.224 --> 30:52.691
Guys like Ronnie--
they usually realize

30:52.693 --> 30:55.393
this is the best it's gonna get,
and they shut up,

30:55.395 --> 30:57.929
and they go drown their sorrows
down at the social.

30:57.931 --> 30:59.864
Oh, it's looks like
you underestimated him,

30:59.866 --> 31:02.033
and now he's getting
his revenge.

31:02.035 --> 31:04.502
I won't underestimate him again.

31:04.504 --> 31:05.904
Hey, you're staying out of this.

31:05.906 --> 31:08.840
Wait... so until
he makes his move,

31:08.842 --> 31:10.742
I gotta have you two in my face,

31:10.744 --> 31:13.211
and-and more cops
outside my door? Great.

31:13.213 --> 31:14.879
Relax, Mr. Vinchetti.
Just...

31:14.881 --> 31:16.314
watch some TV.

31:16.316 --> 31:18.984
You know, maybe
Sal's right, actually.

31:18.986 --> 31:22.554
Maybe we ought to pack up
and... clear out.

31:28.528 --> 31:30.996
Spent all weekend trying
to track Derek down, huh?

31:30.998 --> 31:34.165
Yeah, I looked in every gutter
I ever fished him outta.

31:34.167 --> 31:35.400
No luck?

31:35.402 --> 31:38.036
Not till I found some
of his crack pals last night.

31:38.038 --> 31:40.839
Derek told 'em the guy we're
looking for is named Alphonso,

31:40.841 --> 31:42.173
who keep hitting
these projects

31:42.175 --> 31:43.875
as long
as the pickin's are good.

31:46.046 --> 31:48.847
Hey, boss, how about us,
back out on the street, huh?

31:48.849 --> 31:50.482
Just like old times?
Yeah.

31:50.484 --> 31:53.551
Reagan, I really do appreciate
you helping me out with this.

31:53.553 --> 31:55.787
It means a lot to me.

31:58.625 --> 32:00.158
Boss, look at this guy.

32:00.160 --> 32:01.259
Could be the real perp.

32:01.261 --> 32:03.862
Yeah, does kind of fit
the description, huh?

32:04.965 --> 32:06.197
You! Stop!

32:06.199 --> 32:07.332
Hey!

32:07.334 --> 32:09.134
Derek, drop the gun!

32:09.136 --> 32:10.769
Stay the hell away
from me, man!

32:10.771 --> 32:11.836
RENZULLI:
Drop the gun!

32:11.838 --> 32:13.038
I got you, Alphonso!

32:13.040 --> 32:14.873
(woman screams in distance)

32:14.875 --> 32:17.042
RENZULLI: Derek! Stop!

32:17.044 --> 32:18.343
Drop the gun!

32:18.345 --> 32:19.411
Derek!

32:19.413 --> 32:22.280
(onlookers chattering)

32:22.282 --> 32:23.715
(Derek groans in distance)

32:23.717 --> 32:24.883
(grunts)
RENZULLI: Derek!

32:24.885 --> 32:26.951
JAMIE: Hey, drop the knife!
Drop the knife!

32:26.953 --> 32:29.054
Son of a bitch
was gonna kill me.

32:29.056 --> 32:30.488
RENZULLI: Derek!

32:32.459 --> 32:34.125
Easy, man. Relax.
(gasping)

32:34.127 --> 32:35.660
Relax, man.

32:35.662 --> 32:37.329
Put 'em down.

32:37.331 --> 32:38.363
Come on, hang in there.
Come on.

32:38.365 --> 32:39.497
(gasping weakly):
Tony...

32:39.499 --> 32:40.965
You hang in there.
You hear me?

32:40.967 --> 32:42.167
Tony... (gasps)
Hang in there.

32:42.169 --> 32:43.735
I tried to get him for you.

32:43.737 --> 32:46.071
You did good, man.
You did <i> real</i> good.

32:46.073 --> 32:47.972
He had a gun, man.
It was self-defense.

32:48.975 --> 32:50.608
Central 12-Sergeant,
we need a bus forthwith

32:50.610 --> 32:54.245
to the Parksdale Projects,
central courtyard.

32:54.247 --> 32:55.547
Come on, buddy.

32:57.651 --> 33:00.218
Derek...

33:02.589 --> 33:03.922
No...

33:07.928 --> 33:10.095
Derek...

33:24.211 --> 33:25.577
It's a toy.

33:25.579 --> 33:26.878
What?

33:26.880 --> 33:28.146
It's just a toy.

33:28.148 --> 33:30.048
He was playing... cops...

33:30.851 --> 33:32.150
...with a cap gun.

33:52.753 --> 33:55.187
So I'll RSVP "yes"
to the Mayor's Ball

33:55.189 --> 33:56.822
and "no" to the Rotunda Club.

33:56.824 --> 33:58.390
Thank you.

33:58.392 --> 34:00.225
Strategic Communications Unit
asked if you'd stop by

34:00.227 --> 34:01.593
and personally respond to a few

34:01.595 --> 34:03.028
of the public's
questions on Twitter.

34:03.030 --> 34:04.763
I don't twit.
It's tweet, sir.

34:05.566 --> 34:06.732
That, either.

34:06.734 --> 34:09.735
Understood.
Also, first things...

34:11.639 --> 34:14.273
What?
I just got a text

34:14.275 --> 34:15.641
from Operations about a domestic

34:15.643 --> 34:17.676
reported
in the 12th Precinct.

34:17.678 --> 34:20.713
Patrol responded and kicked in
the door, and an enraged

34:20.715 --> 34:23.282
husband shot one officer
point-blank.

34:25.186 --> 34:27.886
It's Jill Carpenter.

34:39.132 --> 34:41.400
WOMAN:
See you later, Sal.

34:42.036 --> 34:43.569
Come on, Reagan.

34:49.677 --> 34:51.909
Let's go!
(engine starts)

34:54.181 --> 34:56.081
(car doors close,
sedan engine starts)

34:57.718 --> 34:59.451
(engine revs)

35:03.591 --> 35:05.791
(tires screech, engine revs)

35:24.912 --> 35:27.413
(dog barks in distance)

35:36.424 --> 35:38.757
(dog barking in distance)

36:02.750 --> 36:04.683
You stupid son of a bitch.

36:04.685 --> 36:06.652
Get your hands up.

36:10.191 --> 36:12.858
Go ahead, Sal, laugh at me...

36:12.860 --> 36:15.661
like your brother did!

36:16.797 --> 36:18.630
He stopped laughing pretty quick
when I shot him.

36:18.632 --> 36:20.666
(gunshot)

36:24.672 --> 36:27.973
You play me, I play you.

36:33.314 --> 36:35.247
That's the real guy?

36:35.249 --> 36:37.316
Confessed to the robberies.

36:37.318 --> 36:39.251
We'll try to get him
for Derek, too.

36:39.253 --> 36:40.786
I thought my
tour was exciting

36:40.788 --> 36:43.622
because Franklin showed me
a new Thai place on Broadway.

36:43.624 --> 36:45.457
How's Renzulli dealing?

36:45.459 --> 36:47.493
I'm okay.

36:47.495 --> 36:49.761
Sarge, I'm really sorry
about your friend.

36:49.763 --> 36:51.330
Thanks.

36:51.332 --> 36:54.566
I need to say I'm sorry
to you, too, for, uh,

36:54.568 --> 36:56.401
causing problems
between you and Reagan.

36:56.403 --> 36:57.569
That doesn't matter.

36:57.571 --> 36:58.804
No, Sarge.

36:58.806 --> 37:00.739
Nah, it matters,
and the first thing tomorrow,

37:00.741 --> 37:03.408
I'm going to the C.O.
and tell him how I screwed up.

37:03.410 --> 37:05.744
Janko, I want you with me,
to corroborate it.

37:05.746 --> 37:07.146
Me?
Yeah.

37:07.148 --> 37:10.516
Too many friends covering
for each other lately.

37:10.518 --> 37:12.684
I need an impartial voice.

37:12.686 --> 37:14.720
At least
that's the way he put it.

37:14.722 --> 37:16.421
Hey, all I said is

37:16.423 --> 37:19.558
you got a talent for
keeping people in line.

37:19.560 --> 37:22.361
And that you're the best partner
he's ever had.

37:24.532 --> 37:26.832
Bright and early, Janko.

37:30.337 --> 37:32.538
Get out of here.
(laughs)

37:38.279 --> 37:40.512
(indistinct announcement
over P.A.)

37:48.822 --> 37:51.023
Sir.
As you were.

37:53.327 --> 37:55.260
How you doing?

37:55.262 --> 37:59.231
Commissioner, you didn't need
to come down here.

37:59.233 --> 38:01.099
Yes, I did.

38:01.101 --> 38:03.068
I'm okay.

38:03.070 --> 38:05.537
The-the bullet missed
an artery by a hair.

38:05.539 --> 38:08.640
Lucky.

38:08.642 --> 38:11.510
I am, boss.

38:11.512 --> 38:14.446
We got the shooter in custody.

38:14.448 --> 38:16.248
That's good news.

38:16.250 --> 38:19.651
And, uh, I sent a helicopter
to fly your family down.

38:20.788 --> 38:22.454
Fewer red lights that way.

38:22.456 --> 38:25.557
Sir... you already done
enough for me.

38:25.559 --> 38:27.593
(sighs)
Not really.

38:27.595 --> 38:29.061
I had no idea

38:29.063 --> 38:31.830
it was your son's shield number
I was requesting.

38:31.832 --> 38:34.066
Well, there's no way
you could've known.

38:34.068 --> 38:37.502
And <i> my</i> family is honored
to share it with you.

38:37.504 --> 38:41.106
Although, this was kind of
a rocky start.

38:41.108 --> 38:42.474
Sir?

38:42.476 --> 38:44.610
As 46808.
No, sir.

38:44.612 --> 38:47.145
I mean, not that I'm
superstitious or anything.

38:47.147 --> 38:49.448
Sir...

38:49.450 --> 38:51.817
I was wearing my
old shield number.

38:55.623 --> 38:57.689
Oh.

38:57.691 --> 39:01.460
They have to manufacture
a new shield for 46808.

39:01.462 --> 39:04.363
It won't be ready for a week.

39:06.267 --> 39:08.400
That's a good thing.

39:10.304 --> 39:14.673
Could you do me one favor, sir?

39:14.675 --> 39:16.708
If I can.

39:16.710 --> 39:19.811
Tell me a little about Joe.

39:19.813 --> 39:23.415
I'd like to think I could honor
him, too, by wearing his number.

39:36.363 --> 39:38.430
My son Joe.

39:38.432 --> 39:40.032
Good cop.
