WEBVTT

00:02.436 --> 00:06.106
Do I believe that
there is or was life on Mars?

00:06.207 --> 00:07.867
Yes, I'm absolutely certain of it.

00:07.975 --> 00:11.075
There are a lot
of different objects on Mars

00:11.178 --> 00:12.878
that look exactly like sculptures

00:12.947 --> 00:14.507
that human beings make.

00:14.615 --> 00:17.315
We have to ask ourselves

00:17.418 --> 00:19.588
what civilization built this?

00:19.687 --> 00:21.347
And what happened to them?

00:21.455 --> 00:24.055
There's no natural phenomenon

00:24.158 --> 00:26.588
that can account for this nuclear data.

00:26.694 --> 00:29.194
That is weapon signature.

00:29.296 --> 00:31.726
Going to Mars, it's something

00:31.832 --> 00:34.502
we know in somewhere
in the back of our brains

00:34.602 --> 00:37.202
that we have to do or we die.

00:37.304 --> 00:40.644
Since the dawn of civilization,

00:40.741 --> 00:44.681
mankind has credited its origins to gods

00:44.779 --> 00:47.449
and other visitors from the stars.

00:47.548 --> 00:49.748
What if it were true?

00:49.850 --> 00:52.790
Did extraterrestrial beings

00:52.887 --> 00:56.117
really help to shape our history?

00:56.223 --> 00:59.733
And if so, might we find the truth

00:59.827 --> 01:02.627
when humans land on Mars?

# Ancient Aliens 11x02 #
Destination Mars
Original Air Date on May 13, 2016

01:32.593 --> 01:34.333
We are go for launch.

01:34.428 --> 01:35.788
Roger, go for launch.

01:35.896 --> 01:39.496
Earth, 2026.

01:39.600 --> 01:42.500
Five, four, three,

01:42.603 --> 01:44.803
two, one.

01:46.674 --> 01:48.544
We have ignition.

01:48.642 --> 01:51.012
We have lift off.

01:51.112 --> 01:53.252
Four civilian astronauts

01:53.347 --> 01:57.377
begin their 150-day journey
to the Red Planet.

01:57.485 --> 02:00.415
Velocity 14,899 miles per hour.

02:00.521 --> 02:04.991
The voyage will
take them deeper into space

02:05.092 --> 02:06.732
than any human has ever traveled--

02:06.827 --> 02:10.426
over 128 million miles.

02:10.531 --> 02:14.131
200 times farther
than the distance to the moon.

02:18.506 --> 02:21.406
You leave Earth
at a pretty high velocity,

02:21.509 --> 02:23.879
and the spacecraft flies

02:23.978 --> 02:25.808
away from the Earth
and away from the moon

02:25.880 --> 02:27.580
and away from the sun.

02:27.648 --> 02:31.078
The distance away may not be
the biggest concern.

02:31.185 --> 02:34.415
And it only takes
five months to get there.

02:34.522 --> 02:37.762
Now, you can certainly, uh,
uh, withstand that.

02:37.858 --> 02:41.258
So the-the problem is getting back.

02:41.362 --> 02:45.102
They're traveling so fast

02:45.199 --> 02:48.669
that they can go through
ten feet of solid steel.

02:48.769 --> 02:51.139
So a rocket has to be built

02:51.238 --> 02:54.638
so that it's very, very well shielded

02:54.742 --> 02:55.742
for human beings.

02:55.843 --> 02:57.643
It's not an easy trip.

02:57.711 --> 03:01.311
And there are momentous catastrophes

03:01.415 --> 03:03.845
that could occur.

03:03.951 --> 03:05.981
I kind of like to compare that
to when the first explorers

03:06.086 --> 03:07.916
were going across the ocean.

03:08.022 --> 03:09.992
Those were long,
horrible journeys as well

03:10.090 --> 03:11.560
and we survived those.

03:11.659 --> 03:13.329
And I really see Mars

03:13.427 --> 03:15.857
as one of the great,
first stepping stones

03:15.963 --> 03:18.663
to exploring space.

03:18.766 --> 03:23.366
I was born with a fascination for space.

03:23.470 --> 03:26.070
And the only thing
I wanted to do was explore.

03:26.173 --> 03:27.843
I wanted to know what was out there,

03:27.942 --> 03:29.642
and get out there.

03:29.743 --> 03:33.353
And so, by the time
I heard about Mars One,

03:33.447 --> 03:37.317
it felt like there was
a calling, a destiny there.

03:37.418 --> 03:40.018
What an amazing way
to kind of give your life

03:40.154 --> 03:43.694
to the greater cause of humanity.

03:43.757 --> 03:48.457
We are a species of explorers.

03:48.562 --> 03:52.662
And the reason why we keep
looking out there,

03:52.766 --> 03:56.096
in my opinion, is because
that's where we came from.

03:56.203 --> 04:00.843
'Cause you will not find
any other organism on Earth

04:00.941 --> 04:03.441
that has such a fascination with space,

04:03.544 --> 04:06.914
with the stars or with anything

04:07.014 --> 04:10.824
that displays such curiosity
like human beings.

04:10.918 --> 04:14.918
And our next step
will be colonizing Mars.

04:15.022 --> 04:17.622
So the idea

04:17.725 --> 04:20.725
that others have proposed
that we are nothing else

04:20.827 --> 04:25.498
but the Martians,
so we are bound to go there.

04:25.599 --> 04:30.339
According to NASA,
the colonization of Mars

04:30.437 --> 04:33.307
will begin not with humans,
but with robots

04:33.407 --> 04:36.777
sent ahead to construct habitats,

04:36.877 --> 04:41.407
rovers and life-support units.

04:41.515 --> 04:44.145
Food and supplies will be sent next,

04:44.251 --> 04:46.721
and then finally the first humans

04:46.820 --> 04:48.120
will arrive,

04:48.222 --> 04:53.032
ready to start
their new lives as Martians.

04:53.127 --> 04:57.457
The Martian environment
is very different to Earth.

04:57.564 --> 05:00.634
It has 38% of the gravity of Earth.

05:00.734 --> 05:05.504
The daily temperature
fluctuations are very extreme.

05:05.606 --> 05:08.006
For instance, if you're near
the equator on a summer day,

05:08.108 --> 05:10.508
it can be as warm
as 70 degrees Fahrenheit.

05:10.577 --> 05:12.807
But at night,
the temperatures could drop down

05:12.913 --> 05:14.853
to minus 100 degrees Fahrenheit.

05:14.948 --> 05:18.518
So there's a lot of things
out there that's getting us,

05:18.619 --> 05:22.689
including radiation, as well,
and the dust storms.

05:22.790 --> 05:24.820
The atmosphere is incredibly thin--

05:24.925 --> 05:26.855
about one percent of that of Earth.

05:26.960 --> 05:29.230
There's no breathable oxygen there.

05:29.330 --> 05:32.860
The radiation is very high as well.

05:32.966 --> 05:35.366
And so astronauts there

05:35.436 --> 05:38.196
are faced with multiple difficulties.

05:38.305 --> 05:42.035
A Martian day is almost like Earth's.

05:42.142 --> 05:44.582
It's 24 hours and 39 minutes.

05:44.678 --> 05:48.078
So it's just a little bit longer
than a day on Earth.

05:48.182 --> 05:50.522
But a Martian year is two years,

05:50.617 --> 05:53.887
because Mars' orbit
is twice the size of Earth's.

05:55.622 --> 05:58.992
Because of the day-night cycle

05:59.093 --> 06:01.533
and the thin atmosphere,

06:01.628 --> 06:05.798
Mars is the only nearby planet
where large-scale greenhouses

06:05.899 --> 06:09.469
lit by natural sunlight can be utilized.

06:09.570 --> 06:12.000
These structures
will allow the colonizers

06:12.106 --> 06:14.036
to grow their own food

06:14.141 --> 06:17.741
on the cold and barren planet.

06:17.845 --> 06:20.275
Obviously you can't rely on food parcels

06:20.381 --> 06:22.111
from home coming every two years.

06:22.216 --> 06:24.976
You're gonna have to grow your own food.

06:25.085 --> 06:26.815
A lot of people think, "Well,
that's pretty straightforward.

06:26.920 --> 06:31.120
"You just take a few potatoes
and cabbages, and away you go.

06:31.191 --> 06:33.731
You can do farming on Mars."

06:33.794 --> 06:36.604
Now, research that's been done
at Arizona State University

06:36.697 --> 06:39.927
suggests that when you send
microorganisms into space,

06:40.033 --> 06:41.873
they behave differently.

06:41.969 --> 06:44.199
They don't like it up there.

06:44.304 --> 06:48.244
Hundreds, if not thousands,
of PhD theses

06:48.342 --> 06:50.782
in the last 20 years have been written

06:50.878 --> 06:53.508
about how to grow food on Mars.

06:53.614 --> 06:55.854
And there was
a very interesting experiment

06:55.949 --> 06:58.279
done a couple of years ago in Holland,

06:58.385 --> 07:01.115
where NASA provided the Dutch
with what they thought

07:01.221 --> 07:05.021
was almost an identical copy
of the soil on Mars.

07:05.125 --> 07:08.285
And the Dutch planted 4,200 seeds in it,

07:08.395 --> 07:10.625
of all kinds of different vegetables.

07:10.731 --> 07:12.631
And every single seed germinated.

07:12.733 --> 07:14.333
Some things did better than others--

07:14.435 --> 07:17.135
like carrots grew very well there.

07:17.237 --> 07:18.937
There is no question that we will

07:19.039 --> 07:21.839
be able to grow food on Mars.

07:21.942 --> 07:25.642
But it's gonna be hundreds
of years before we grow

07:25.746 --> 07:29.706
enough food on Mars that we can
survive from the food we grow.

07:29.817 --> 07:32.647
The only way we're gonna
be able to do that

07:32.753 --> 07:36.053
is to terraform the planet,
so that it becomes much

07:36.156 --> 07:37.986
more Earth-like
so that we can grow crops

07:38.058 --> 07:41.228
on the surface of the planet.

07:41.328 --> 07:43.698
In recent years,

07:43.764 --> 07:47.634
scientists have proposed various
methods to terraform Mars,

07:47.734 --> 07:51.604
deliberately altering it
to be more Earth-like.

07:51.705 --> 07:55.835
Most focus on
melting the ice at the poles

07:55.909 --> 08:00.479
to release carbon dioxide into
the atmosphere to thicken it.

08:00.581 --> 08:04.321
If we heat up the poles on Mars,

08:04.418 --> 08:07.248
that causes a significant
temperature rise on Mars,

08:07.354 --> 08:10.024
and we start having
flowing water on Mars,

08:10.090 --> 08:11.620
especially around the equator.

08:11.725 --> 08:14.185
Then water itself
will go into the atmosphere,

08:14.294 --> 08:16.164
which is another greenhouse gas.

08:16.263 --> 08:18.833
And we will warm up Mars.

08:18.932 --> 08:22.102
And we will be able to plant
crops on the surface of Mars.

08:22.202 --> 08:24.142
But that's a ways away.

08:24.238 --> 08:28.168
That's probably at least 300 years away.

08:28.275 --> 08:32.735
With missions from
both NASA and the private sector

08:32.846 --> 08:36.176
now officially in the works,
humans landing

08:36.283 --> 08:41.053
on Mars is no longer
the stuff of science fiction.

08:41.154 --> 08:44.164
But will we really go so far

08:44.258 --> 08:46.458
as to terraform the planet so that

08:46.560 --> 08:48.660
we can establish
permanent residency there?

08:48.762 --> 08:51.362
And if so, why?

08:51.465 --> 08:56.165
What is it about Mars
that compels us to go there?

08:56.270 --> 08:59.300
Interestingly, the conditions on Earth

08:59.406 --> 09:03.106
three to four billion years ago
are thought to be

09:03.210 --> 09:06.180
much different from what they are today.

09:06.280 --> 09:10.120
Like Mars, the planet
was relatively uninhabitable

09:10.217 --> 09:13.287
and lacked an atmosphere.

09:14.988 --> 09:17.158
According to ancient astronaut
theorists,

09:17.257 --> 09:20.027
directed terraforming

09:20.127 --> 09:22.187
may have been exactly how life
was started on Earth.

09:22.296 --> 09:23.956
And as evidence,

09:24.064 --> 09:28.204
they point to our earliest
creation stories.

09:28.302 --> 09:30.802
When we look
at the world's creation myths,

09:30.904 --> 09:33.514
one of the things that we find
throughout these stories

09:33.607 --> 09:36.307
is the idea that
the gods sought to create

09:36.410 --> 09:39.380
a stable environment on the Earth.

09:39.479 --> 09:44.219
The story of Genesis could be
seen as a step-by-step guide

09:44.318 --> 09:47.018
for terraforming the Earth.

09:47.120 --> 09:49.920
On day one, God or the gods

09:50.023 --> 09:52.623
created the universe.

09:52.726 --> 09:55.786
On day two, the gods
created the firmament.

09:55.862 --> 09:58.062
This is described as a dome,

09:58.131 --> 10:02.131
or a boundary
separating heaven and Earth.

10:02.235 --> 10:05.265
Followed by the appearance
of plants and animals

10:05.372 --> 10:08.712
and later human beings.

10:08.809 --> 10:11.279
To me, when I look at Genesis,

10:11.378 --> 10:14.248
it is exactly the thought

10:14.348 --> 10:16.248
of an extraterrestrial visitation.

10:16.350 --> 10:19.280
I'm sure there's a god--
there's no doubt about that.

10:19.386 --> 10:21.486
That there's a higher power.

10:21.588 --> 10:25.418
But somewhere along the line,
extraterrestrials

10:25.525 --> 10:29.025
came down to this planet, created us,

10:29.129 --> 10:31.159
maybe even terraformed the planet,

10:31.264 --> 10:33.404
so that it could be adaptable to life.

10:33.500 --> 10:37.370
Heck, we're talking about doing
that on Mars right now.

10:37.471 --> 10:40.241
The things that we'll be
doing on Mars may be

10:40.340 --> 10:43.310
exactly the same things
that extraterrestrials did

10:43.410 --> 10:45.310
when they came to our planet.

10:45.412 --> 10:47.552
We'll be terraforming that planet.

10:47.648 --> 10:50.718
Creating a more conducive atmosphere.

10:50.817 --> 10:54.917
Melting icecaps to create
rivers and lakes.

10:55.022 --> 10:57.462
And then perhaps even
genetically manipulating

10:57.557 --> 11:01.787
organisms to better survive
on that planet.

11:01.895 --> 11:05.995
And perhaps mankind is being
guided by extraterrestrials

11:06.099 --> 11:11.069
to go to Mars and colonize
that Red Planet.

11:13.740 --> 11:17.140
With our plans to colonize Mars,

11:17.244 --> 11:21.154
are humans actually
following in the footsteps

11:21.248 --> 11:23.248
of extraterrestrials that came to Earth

11:23.350 --> 11:25.580
in the remote past?

11:25.686 --> 11:29.846
Ancient astronaut theorists
suggest that not only

11:29.956 --> 11:33.586
is this the case,
but that there is even evidence

11:33.694 --> 11:36.134
these alien visitors
might have come here

11:36.229 --> 11:40.529
from the very planet
that is now our destination.

11:45.564 --> 11:48.904
On March 10, 2006,

11:49.001 --> 11:52.841
the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter
reached its destination,

11:52.938 --> 11:55.908
and began orbiting 186 miles

11:56.008 --> 11:59.478
above the Martian surface.

11:59.578 --> 12:04.348
It has circled the planet over
40,000 times and has sent

12:04.449 --> 12:07.879
over 264 terabytes of data

12:07.986 --> 12:09.886
and 200,000 images

12:09.988 --> 12:13.088
back to researchers on Earth.

12:14.226 --> 12:18.186
On September 28, 2015,

12:18.296 --> 12:20.796
NASA scientists announced

12:20.899 --> 12:23.499
that the images received
from the Orbiter

12:23.602 --> 12:25.872
had finally led to the kind

12:25.971 --> 12:28.371
of groundbreaking discovery
they were hoping for--

12:28.473 --> 12:32.783
evidence of water on Mars.

12:32.878 --> 12:36.908
Photographs taken by the Orbiter

12:37.015 --> 12:41.175
reveal streaks that appear to
ebb and flow through the year,

12:41.253 --> 12:44.923
much like the seasonal
flow of rivers on Earth.

12:45.023 --> 12:49.593
Astrobiologists have had a wake-up call.

12:49.694 --> 12:53.104
If there is flowing
underground water on Mars,

12:53.198 --> 12:55.928
and since we know that all
the chemicals structures on Mars

12:56.034 --> 12:59.004
for life are the same
as they are on Earth.

12:59.104 --> 13:03.474
If you have that, it's unlikely

13:03.575 --> 13:06.275
that there is not life on Mars.

13:06.378 --> 13:08.778
The big question
everybody wants to know is--

13:08.880 --> 13:11.610
is there enough there for Mars life?

13:11.716 --> 13:13.676
And in my view, the answer is yes.

13:13.785 --> 13:17.485
You don't have to have
liquid water lying around

13:17.589 --> 13:20.919
like a pond in order
for microbes to make a living.

13:21.026 --> 13:23.686
There are microorganisms on Earth

13:23.762 --> 13:26.532
that live in Mars-like conditions.

13:26.631 --> 13:29.801
So do I believe that there is
or was life on Mars?

13:29.901 --> 13:32.171
And I say yes,
I'm absolutely certain of it.

13:33.505 --> 13:36.435
In 1996,

13:36.541 --> 13:39.211
NASA researchers studying

13:39.311 --> 13:42.251
a Martian meteorite found
on the Alan Hill ice fields

13:42.347 --> 13:44.047
of Antarctica

13:44.116 --> 13:46.546
announce a shocking discovery--

13:46.618 --> 13:50.118
evidence of past microbial life

13:50.222 --> 13:51.992
on Mars.

13:52.090 --> 13:53.920
They backed away from this conclusion

13:53.992 --> 13:58.562
shortly after it made
international headlines.

13:58.663 --> 14:01.133
Over a decade later,

14:01.233 --> 14:04.003
scientists re-examining the meteorite

14:04.102 --> 14:07.902
determine that it does indeed
contain organic matter

14:08.006 --> 14:12.206
and evidence of bacterial fossils.

14:12.277 --> 14:15.037
The evidence for microbial life
on early Mars

14:15.147 --> 14:17.377
from the meteorites is now very strong.

14:17.482 --> 14:19.322
It's almost overwhelming.

14:19.417 --> 14:21.417
Not only do some of the Mars meteorites

14:21.520 --> 14:24.090
show signs of early life on Mars,

14:24.189 --> 14:27.719
almost every one of them does.

14:30.295 --> 14:32.825
While evidence of microbial life

14:32.931 --> 14:36.401
in Mars meteorites is groundbreaking,

14:36.501 --> 14:41.241
in 2013, geochemist Steven Benner

14:41.339 --> 14:43.639
presented findings suggesting

14:43.742 --> 14:46.042
these meteorites point to a possibility

14:46.144 --> 14:48.214
even more astonishing than the notion

14:48.313 --> 14:51.613
that there was once life on Mars.

14:51.716 --> 14:54.376
He claims that they may be responsible

14:54.486 --> 14:58.116
for seeding life here on Earth.

14:58.223 --> 15:01.393
Benner reached this conclusion
when he found

15:01.493 --> 15:04.063
that particular elements
believed to be crucial

15:04.162 --> 15:08.002
to the origin of life are
not readily available on Earth,

15:08.099 --> 15:10.029
and would only have been present

15:10.135 --> 15:12.895
on the surface of the Red Planet.

15:13.004 --> 15:16.274
I've always felt that Mars was actually

15:16.374 --> 15:19.184
a better place than Earth
for life to get going.

15:19.277 --> 15:23.447
Now Steve Benner recently has
added to the appeal of Mars

15:23.548 --> 15:25.348
as the cradle of life

15:25.450 --> 15:29.050
by pointing out that certain
elements that are actually

15:29.154 --> 15:33.194
essential for organic chemistry
to work properly

15:33.291 --> 15:35.121
like boron and molybdenum,

15:35.227 --> 15:38.657
which are more abundant on Mars
than they are on Earth.

15:38.763 --> 15:42.203
We can imagine that life
on Earth started on Mars,

15:42.300 --> 15:45.570
so in a sense we're all Martians
or descended from Martians.

15:48.073 --> 15:52.213
Life on Earth seeded from Mars?

15:52.310 --> 15:56.310
Could we, in fact, be Martians?

15:56.414 --> 15:59.654
Ancient astronaut theorists say yes,

15:59.751 --> 16:02.951
and suggest that this seeding of Earth

16:03.054 --> 16:05.794
may even have been a directed effort

16:05.890 --> 16:08.090
orchestrated by human-like beings

16:08.193 --> 16:11.033
that existed on the Red Planet.

16:11.129 --> 16:14.729
And they claim these
extraterrestrial ancestors

16:14.833 --> 16:18.033
can be found in the apocryphal texts

16:18.136 --> 16:20.136
of the Hebrew bible,

16:20.238 --> 16:24.208
represented as the "fallen angels."

16:24.276 --> 16:28.436
We know from ancient legend
of the books of Enoch,

16:28.546 --> 16:33.076
that there was a group of angels

16:33.184 --> 16:35.624
who descended to Earth

16:35.720 --> 16:38.660
in violation of divine law.

16:38.757 --> 16:41.587
They introduced to humanity

16:41.660 --> 16:43.460
ways, means, knowledge,

16:43.561 --> 16:46.701
which we would understand today
as science and technology.

16:46.798 --> 16:51.768
These angels were in human form.

16:51.870 --> 16:54.640
They were called, in Hebrew,
Ishim, which means men.

16:54.739 --> 16:58.709
They looked just like us.

17:00.879 --> 17:04.579
The fallen angels were giants.

17:04.648 --> 17:08.419
They were at least ten feet
tall, very striking to look at.

17:08.520 --> 17:10.450
Enormous eyes.

17:10.555 --> 17:12.755
And no wings.

17:12.857 --> 17:15.426
For over 100 years, mythologists

17:15.492 --> 17:19.363
have been contemplating this
idea that the fallen angels

17:19.464 --> 17:20.964
came from Mars to Earth.

17:21.066 --> 17:23.726
Even Dante described this
in the Paradiso.

17:23.835 --> 17:26.595
He called this
the fifth level of heaven.

17:26.704 --> 17:29.435
Is it possible that the fallen angels

17:29.541 --> 17:31.911
came to Earth from Mars?

17:35.380 --> 17:38.250
Could we reinterpret
the story of fallen angels

17:38.350 --> 17:41.450
as beings not from heaven,

17:41.553 --> 17:43.553
but from Mars?

17:43.655 --> 17:47.155
Based on examination of the astronauts

17:47.225 --> 17:50.355
living in the International
Space Station,

17:50.428 --> 17:53.558
scientists have speculated
on what physiological changes

17:53.665 --> 17:56.625
might be seen in future generations

17:56.735 --> 17:59.465
of humans born on Mars.

17:59.571 --> 18:02.471
And ancient astronaut theorists suggest

18:02.574 --> 18:05.514
the resemblance to the
description of fallen angels

18:05.610 --> 18:08.340
may be uncanny.

18:08.446 --> 18:11.606
One of the most amazing
things about the human body

18:11.716 --> 18:13.946
is its ability to adapt.

18:14.052 --> 18:16.822
And if you look at astronauts
who go into space,

18:16.921 --> 18:20.161
they actually grow
about two or three inches.

18:20.258 --> 18:22.758
And when you have a human
that's born on Mars,

18:22.861 --> 18:24.861
what's gonna happen is the environment

18:24.963 --> 18:27.663
will change the structure
of the human body.

18:27.766 --> 18:30.096
And what you're gonna see
in a few generations

18:30.201 --> 18:32.371
is humans that are taller and skinnier,

18:32.470 --> 18:35.940
because the gravity on Mars
is less than that of Earth.

18:36.040 --> 18:39.810
If humans evolve
long enough on the planet Mars,

18:39.911 --> 18:41.541
they could grow to be taller,

18:41.646 --> 18:43.206
they'd have the bigger heads;

18:43.281 --> 18:44.781
they'd have the spindly limbs.

18:44.883 --> 18:47.183
They might actually grow
slightly larger eyes

18:47.285 --> 18:49.345
that were equipped
to see better in the dark,

18:49.454 --> 18:51.224
because you simply
have less sunlight on Mars

18:51.322 --> 18:52.662
than you do on the Earth,

18:52.757 --> 18:54.817
because it's farther away from the sun.

18:54.893 --> 18:57.533
They could also end up looking
like representations

18:57.629 --> 18:59.729
of angels and various

18:59.831 --> 19:01.761
other god-like beings
that we've read about

19:01.866 --> 19:04.566
in the Bible
and other ancient documents.

19:04.669 --> 19:07.469
These attributes to somebody

19:07.572 --> 19:10.842
from a low-gravity planet like Mars

19:10.942 --> 19:12.812
or being in space for a long time

19:12.911 --> 19:16.251
may well be the attributes that we see

19:16.314 --> 19:19.624
of the fallen angels being very tall

19:19.717 --> 19:21.677
and-and spindly

19:21.786 --> 19:23.686
and-and perhaps pale

19:23.788 --> 19:27.718
and with large eyes.

19:27.826 --> 19:29.886
Something that we might
expect to be coming

19:29.994 --> 19:33.364
from another planet like Mars.

19:33.465 --> 19:36.165
Might life on Earth

19:36.267 --> 19:39.537
really have originated on Mars?

19:39.637 --> 19:43.407
And is it possible it was not by chance,

19:43.508 --> 19:45.308
but by design?

19:45.410 --> 19:49.680
And if so, just what happened
to the Martians?

19:49.781 --> 19:53.751
Perhaps clues can be found by examining

19:53.852 --> 19:56.892
what some say is undeniable evidence

19:56.988 --> 20:00.318
of weapons of mass destruction.

20:08.032 --> 20:10.332
Spanning 2,500 miles

20:10.434 --> 20:13.274
across the equatorial region
of the Red Planet

20:13.371 --> 20:16.911
is a colossal gash in the crust.

20:17.008 --> 20:19.808
Called the Valles Marineris,

20:19.910 --> 20:22.640
it is over four miles deep,

20:22.747 --> 20:26.877
which is four times
the depth of the Grand Canyon.

20:26.984 --> 20:29.284
And it runs a length equal

20:29.387 --> 20:31.347
to the span of the United States

20:31.455 --> 20:33.985
from New York to California.

20:34.091 --> 20:35.891
The Valles Marineris

20:35.993 --> 20:37.793
is one of the biggest tranches on Mars.

20:37.895 --> 20:42.155
It was named after one of the
Mariner missions in the '70s.

20:42.266 --> 20:44.526
It has some very interesting
geological features.

20:44.635 --> 20:46.095
It's quite huge.

20:46.203 --> 20:48.103
So it's really an interesting challenge

20:48.205 --> 20:50.035
to figure out what formed this valley.

20:50.107 --> 20:52.507
It is truly immense.

20:52.610 --> 20:54.480
And the question is, uh,

20:54.578 --> 20:58.948
why did these features occur
on Mars on such a grand scale?

20:59.050 --> 21:03.150
The Grand Canyon is, you know,
created by the Colorado River.

21:03.254 --> 21:05.954
I don't think the Valles Marineris

21:06.057 --> 21:07.787
was created by a river.

21:07.892 --> 21:09.362
It's very clear that it hasn't been made

21:09.460 --> 21:12.360
by water erosion.

21:12.463 --> 21:15.503
The prevailing scientific theory

21:15.599 --> 21:17.429
suggests that the gash

21:17.535 --> 21:19.965
may be the result of volcanic activity

21:20.071 --> 21:23.471
combined with shifts in crustal plates.

21:23.574 --> 21:27.084
However, engineer Ralph Juergens

21:27.144 --> 21:31.684
argued in his 1974 article,
"Of the Moon and Mars,"

21:31.782 --> 21:35.082
that the geographic features
of the Valles Marineris

21:35.152 --> 21:38.852
did not show signs
of being torn and upended

21:38.956 --> 21:41.216
as is typical of volcanic thrusts.

21:41.325 --> 21:45.955
But rather,
it appeared to be carved out.

21:46.063 --> 21:49.063
Juergens proposed that the feature

21:49.166 --> 21:50.866
resembled the residual marks

21:50.968 --> 21:54.468
left behind by an electrical discharge.

21:56.841 --> 21:58.941
According to his theory,

21:59.043 --> 22:02.613
the area was zapped by
a powerful cosmic thunderbolt,

22:02.713 --> 22:06.723
carving out the landscape as it
advanced across the surface,

22:06.817 --> 22:10.317
blasting material into space.

22:11.856 --> 22:14.056
Although NASA scientists

22:14.158 --> 22:15.988
dismiss the theory,

22:16.093 --> 22:20.463
it has been gaining traction
with electrical engineers.

22:20.564 --> 22:22.704
By using

22:22.766 --> 22:25.026
two electrodes to create
an electrical arc

22:25.136 --> 22:28.066
over a sandy surface,
they have been able

22:28.172 --> 22:30.542
to demonstrate on a small-scale

22:30.608 --> 22:33.808
how the Valles Marineris
could have been carved out

22:33.911 --> 22:37.281
by an electric bolt.

22:37.381 --> 22:39.651
You don't see this type of thing
with a volcano

22:39.750 --> 22:43.120
or an earthquake or any other
type of natural occurrence.

22:43.220 --> 22:46.460
The feature itself resembles

22:46.557 --> 22:48.857
many of the electric discharges
that we've done.

22:51.695 --> 22:55.195
But could a cosmic thunderbolt

22:55.299 --> 22:59.269
be responsible for
the massive gash across Mars?

22:59.370 --> 23:02.540
If so, was it a natural occurrence

23:02.640 --> 23:05.810
or an attack?

23:05.910 --> 23:08.480
There are some very interesting stories

23:08.579 --> 23:11.879
of ancient advanced
thunderbolt-like weapons.

23:11.949 --> 23:15.719
For example, in the Norse,
Greek, and Vedic traditions,

23:15.819 --> 23:20.489
there is a weapon that can
destroy entire worlds.

23:20.591 --> 23:22.521
In the Vedic text,

23:22.626 --> 23:25.586
uh, what is found is called "Vajra."

23:25.696 --> 23:28.256
"Vajra" means thunderbolt.

23:28.365 --> 23:30.895
And this is a very powerful weapon

23:31.001 --> 23:33.901
that God Indra carries.

23:34.004 --> 23:36.474
And it was a special weapon
that was designed

23:36.574 --> 23:40.644
to destroy this giant called Vritra.

23:40.744 --> 23:44.514
Vritra represented the dark force.

23:44.615 --> 23:48.045
And then he was creating havoc
in the universe.

23:48.152 --> 23:50.152
So he had to be destroyed.

23:50.254 --> 23:52.754
And Indra used this weapon

23:52.856 --> 23:55.616
to destroy this giant.

23:55.726 --> 24:00.056
Vajra is this super
lightning bolt strike

24:00.164 --> 24:03.234
that devastates everything

24:03.334 --> 24:08.104
and is the most destructive
weapon that the gods have.

24:08.205 --> 24:12.765
And if you look on Mars
that scar appears to be

24:12.876 --> 24:17.346
from some huge electric strike.

24:17.448 --> 24:20.118
Perhaps this Vajra weapon of Indra

24:20.217 --> 24:22.677
that is hitting the planet

24:22.786 --> 24:26.586
and creating a huge canyon

24:26.690 --> 24:29.020
and may be what

24:29.126 --> 24:32.256
really changed Mars.

24:32.363 --> 24:34.963
It would seem that these weapons

24:35.065 --> 24:38.165
are extraterrestrial in nature.

24:40.704 --> 24:42.574
Could the Vajra described

24:42.673 --> 24:45.043
in the ancient Vedic texts

24:45.142 --> 24:48.642
be a super weapon
used against the planet?

24:48.712 --> 24:51.912
Ancient astronaut theorists say yes,

24:51.982 --> 24:54.852
and suggest there is even evidence

24:54.952 --> 24:57.022
of other weapons of mass destruction

24:57.121 --> 25:01.061
being detonated on the Red Planet.

25:03.060 --> 25:05.390
In a 2014 paper

25:05.496 --> 25:08.196
published in The Journal of Cosmology,

25:08.299 --> 25:10.969
physicist Dr. John Brandenburg

25:11.068 --> 25:13.098
presented findings indicating

25:13.203 --> 25:15.303
that someone or something

25:15.406 --> 25:17.006
wiped out life on Mars

25:17.107 --> 25:20.807
with massive nuclear explosions.

25:20.911 --> 25:24.681
There's  an enormous spike in Xenon 129

25:24.782 --> 25:27.122
in the Martian atmosphere.

25:27.217 --> 25:29.647
Xenon 129 is produced

25:29.753 --> 25:33.093
by very violent nuclear reactions.

25:33.190 --> 25:36.120
I originally proposed as an explanation

25:36.226 --> 25:39.996
that this was a natural nuclear
reactor that had gone unstable.

25:40.064 --> 25:43.034
However, as I talked to more scientists,

25:43.133 --> 25:46.373
they said the xenon spectrum is wrong.

25:46.437 --> 25:48.337
That is weapon signature.

25:48.439 --> 25:52.139
That is not from any kind
of natural nuclear reactor.

25:52.242 --> 25:54.712
The pattern of radiation

25:54.812 --> 25:57.482
on the Mars surface indicates

25:57.581 --> 26:00.581
that there is a global debris pattern

26:00.684 --> 26:03.124
extending from two hot spots
of radiation

26:03.220 --> 26:05.190
in the north of Mars

26:05.289 --> 26:07.859
going all the way around the planet.

26:07.958 --> 26:11.658
The regions of the residual
radioactivity

26:11.762 --> 26:14.462
are covered in glass--

26:14.565 --> 26:17.395
the same sort of acid-etched glass

26:17.501 --> 26:19.741
that was found at nuclear test sites.

26:19.837 --> 26:21.497
It's called trinitite.

26:21.605 --> 26:24.105
So thousands of square miles
of Mars' surface

26:24.208 --> 26:26.168
apparently were turned to glass.

26:26.276 --> 26:31.046
Someone apparently dropped two
massive nuclear weapons on Mars

26:31.148 --> 26:33.278
to explode in mid-air.

26:33.384 --> 26:35.354
There's no natural phenomenon

26:35.452 --> 26:39.822
that can account for this nuclear data.

26:39.923 --> 26:41.893
So we must go to Mars.

26:41.992 --> 26:45.062
We must find out exactly
what happened there.

26:45.162 --> 26:49.532
Are there really tell-tale signs

26:49.633 --> 26:53.203
of orchestrated
mass destruction on Mars?

26:53.303 --> 26:56.203
If so, might some of the survivors

26:56.273 --> 26:58.773
have made it to Earth?

26:58.876 --> 27:01.836
Perhaps further evidence can be found

27:01.945 --> 27:04.675
by examining the landscape of Mars,

27:04.782 --> 27:07.352
and its mysterious formations

27:07.451 --> 27:10.851
that some say are alien artifacts.

27:20.231 --> 27:22.331
554 solar days

27:22.433 --> 27:26.503
after the Mars Curiosity Rover
touched down,

27:26.604 --> 27:28.544
it beams its latest high-resolution

27:28.606 --> 27:32.836
panoramic photographs
of the Mars landscape to Earth.

27:34.211 --> 27:37.081
Upon inspection, amateur archaeologists

27:37.148 --> 27:39.318
announce a startling discovery--

27:39.417 --> 27:41.277
what appears to be an effigy

27:41.385 --> 27:43.345
located at the Dingo Gap,

27:43.421 --> 27:46.461
resembling a human statue.

27:46.557 --> 27:50.957
The find is just one of the dozens

27:51.062 --> 27:55.802
of strange earth-like objects
sighted in the Rover images--

27:55.866 --> 28:00.436
including a sarcophagus...

28:00.504 --> 28:03.044
a Buddha statue...

28:06.143 --> 28:09.313
...and even a cross.

28:09.413 --> 28:11.083
There are a lot

28:11.182 --> 28:13.022
of different objects
on Mars that people see,

28:13.050 --> 28:15.520
or think they see,
in various rover images.

28:15.586 --> 28:18.086
And it's really hard to dismiss them,

28:18.189 --> 28:19.889
because they do look exactly

28:19.957 --> 28:22.217
like sculptures that human beings make.

28:22.326 --> 28:25.386
And even after a massive cataclysm,

28:25.496 --> 28:27.356
like what apparently took place on Mars,

28:27.465 --> 28:30.295
you're gonna find remnants
from a lost civilization

28:30.401 --> 28:33.341
that's just leaving behind
those last hints that

28:33.404 --> 28:35.004
we were here.

28:35.106 --> 28:38.406
Ancient astronaut theorists

28:38.476 --> 28:40.406
have considered that there may be

28:40.478 --> 28:44.248
artifacts and unnatural
structures on Mars

28:44.315 --> 28:46.145
since the first images where beamed back

28:46.217 --> 28:48.017
from the Mars Viking Mission

28:48.119 --> 28:51.219
in 1979.

28:51.288 --> 28:54.718
NASA officials claim
the perceived likeness

28:54.825 --> 28:57.285
of formations on Mars
to man-made objects

28:57.395 --> 28:59.825
is due to Pareidolia,

28:59.930 --> 29:02.430
where the mind perceives
a familiar pattern,

29:02.533 --> 29:06.003
like seeing shapes in clouds.

29:06.103 --> 29:09.473
But some imaging experts
are not convinced

29:09.573 --> 29:12.513
that it's just a trick of the eye.

29:12.610 --> 29:14.610
Joe White has been working

29:14.712 --> 29:17.612
in image restoration for 25 years,

29:17.715 --> 29:20.815
and claims to have found
artifacts on the Martian surface

29:20.918 --> 29:22.918
that defy explanation.

29:23.020 --> 29:24.620
The Rover images

29:24.722 --> 29:27.122
are generally fairly close-up,
and it is possible

29:27.191 --> 29:30.631
to spot things like statue heads
and stone blocks,

29:30.728 --> 29:34.198
sometimes with writing on
and carvings in them.

29:34.298 --> 29:37.928
It's such a shame they, they do
so much to destroy these images.

29:38.002 --> 29:39.542
But basically what they do
is they resize them down

29:39.637 --> 29:41.397
so that the detail's all lost.

29:41.472 --> 29:43.312
But because I've worked in
photographic restoration,

29:43.374 --> 29:45.244
I know how to do it.

29:45.342 --> 29:47.242
All I've done with this is
actually enhanced the contrast

29:47.344 --> 29:48.614
and sharpened it a little bit.

29:48.712 --> 29:51.082
The details I noticed first were

29:51.182 --> 29:53.052
particularly the eye and nose details

29:53.150 --> 29:56.120
on the front of the, of the,
the statue on the left here

29:56.187 --> 29:58.647
with a very quite clear mouth structure

29:58.722 --> 30:02.192
and what looks like an ear, just here.

30:02.293 --> 30:06.533
And you have a long narrow
elongated cone head shape

30:06.630 --> 30:08.800
to the statue.

30:08.899 --> 30:11.129
Now this may well be
an elaborate headdress

30:11.235 --> 30:13.895
on this statue here,
which seems to be broken off.

30:14.004 --> 30:15.474
But it's hard to say for sure.

30:15.539 --> 30:17.209
I mean this is a, it's a damaged statue,

30:17.274 --> 30:19.274
buried up to its chin

30:19.376 --> 30:21.936
and there's probably a lot more of it

30:22.046 --> 30:23.446
buried just below in the sand.

30:23.547 --> 30:25.307
But you can actually see quite clearly

30:25.416 --> 30:27.076
it's the sort of thing
you would expect to find

30:27.184 --> 30:29.954
somewhere like Central or South America.

30:32.623 --> 30:35.563
Might there actually
be ruins of a lost civilization

30:35.626 --> 30:40.326
scattered across the Martian landscape?

30:40.431 --> 30:45.031
Ruins that mirror those
that exist on our own planet?

30:45.136 --> 30:48.566
Ancient Astronaut theorists say yes,

30:48.672 --> 30:51.112
and propose that this is

30:51.175 --> 30:53.905
one of many artifacts on Mars

30:53.978 --> 30:57.948
that seem to have
counterparts on our Earth.

30:58.048 --> 31:01.718
Certain structures on Mars
may be completely

31:01.819 --> 31:04.649
related to structures here on Earth.

31:04.722 --> 31:09.262
On Mars, we have structures
that look like pyramids.

31:09.360 --> 31:11.690
There are standing stones

31:11.795 --> 31:16.025
and Stonehenge-type
of structures on Mars.

31:16.133 --> 31:20.343
There's also a structure on Mars
that looks like a Sphinx.

31:23.140 --> 31:25.710
Around Cydonia,
there are many, many objects,

31:25.809 --> 31:27.579
including an area called "the city,"

31:27.678 --> 31:30.848
where the so-called face
on Mars is located.

31:30.948 --> 31:33.378
There's a massive pentagonal pyramid.

31:33.484 --> 31:36.324
There's a cluster
of other pyramidal objects

31:36.420 --> 31:37.990
that are nearby.

31:38.055 --> 31:40.155
And one of the things that's
really interesting

31:40.257 --> 31:42.117
about the city is that some
people have pointed out that

31:42.226 --> 31:45.156
if you take the apex of all of
the pyramidal structures there--

31:45.229 --> 31:46.729
and there are number of them--

31:46.797 --> 31:50.267
that they basically match
the layout of the Pleiades.

31:50.334 --> 31:53.004
Now, this is something
that we've seen here on Earth.

31:53.070 --> 31:56.100
We've seen various ancient
architectural monuments

31:56.207 --> 31:57.807
that are also laid out to reflect

31:57.875 --> 32:00.175
the constellation of the Pleiades.

32:00.244 --> 32:03.314
Is it possible
that the structures on Mars

32:03.414 --> 32:06.484
are real and of artificial origin?

32:06.584 --> 32:09.424
That is something
where all of science says,

32:09.520 --> 32:11.450
"No, impossible."

32:11.555 --> 32:13.215
Well, is it really?

32:13.290 --> 32:15.490
Water on Mars-- impossible, right?

32:15.593 --> 32:17.563
No, it has been proven.

32:17.661 --> 32:20.101
So we have to ask ourselves

32:20.130 --> 32:23.570
what civilization built this?

32:23.667 --> 32:25.667
And what happened to them?

32:25.769 --> 32:30.169
And some have suggested that
they actually escaped Mars

32:30.274 --> 32:34.484
and came to Earth
to ensure their survival.

32:34.578 --> 32:36.708
When we look to these
extraordinary structures

32:36.780 --> 32:41.080
on Earth, similar to what
we're now seeing on Mars,

32:41.185 --> 32:43.445
it makes you wonder did
our ancient extraterrestrial

32:43.554 --> 32:48.164
ancestors teach humans
how to build these monuments?

32:48.225 --> 32:51.125
And knowing that one day,
we would rediscover our roots

32:51.228 --> 32:54.298
on Mars and be able to match up
what we've done on Earth

32:54.398 --> 32:56.598
with what we had already done on Mars.

32:56.667 --> 33:00.637
Might the various
structures and artifacts

33:00.738 --> 33:03.708
found on the surface of Mars

33:03.807 --> 33:07.207
really be evidence
of a past Martian civilization?

33:07.311 --> 33:12.111
A civilization that was
recreated on Earth?

33:14.218 --> 33:18.288
If so, why would NASA
try to hide this connection?

33:18.389 --> 33:20.419
And might there be more

33:20.491 --> 33:23.191
that the public isn't being told?

33:26.080 --> 33:30.320
The $2.5 billion Mars Curiosity

33:30.417 --> 33:34.817
is the most advanced rover yet
to explore the Martian terrain.

33:34.889 --> 33:38.719
Beyond obtaining
high-resolution photographs,

33:38.792 --> 33:41.162
as well as soil and air samples,

33:41.228 --> 33:45.098
as it travels across
the surface of the planet--

33:45.165 --> 33:47.625
it is also able
to turn the camera on itself.

33:47.701 --> 33:51.301
A feature that enables engineers at NASA

33:51.405 --> 33:55.435
to diagnose and troubleshoot
issues from Earth.

33:55.542 --> 33:59.282
Curiously, 50 solar days
into its mission,

33:59.346 --> 34:03.616
the rover beamed a mysterious
photograph back to Earth

34:03.717 --> 34:06.347
showing what appeared
to some researchers

34:06.420 --> 34:09.420
to be the shadow of a human-like figure

34:09.523 --> 34:12.163
working on the Rover.

34:12.259 --> 34:14.228
You could see a person there.

34:14.295 --> 34:17.594
And even it seemed that
he was not wearing a helmet,

34:17.697 --> 34:21.697
but was in some kind
of gear and goggles.

34:21.802 --> 34:25.802
And it made people speculate
that what might be going on

34:25.873 --> 34:29.313
on Mars is more than what NASA

34:29.409 --> 34:32.580
and also the military space program

34:32.679 --> 34:35.750
has said that we can achieve.

34:35.849 --> 34:38.849
NASA knows so much more about Mars

34:38.953 --> 34:40.293
than they are telling us.

34:40.387 --> 34:41.746
They put pictures out.

34:41.855 --> 34:43.284
They allow things to come out.

34:43.389 --> 34:45.320
They do not comment on them, in general,

34:45.426 --> 34:48.426
but they just allow people
with eyes, who want to see,

34:48.495 --> 34:50.395
to look at these things
and understand what they are.

34:50.496 --> 34:52.897
But they don't say anything about it,

34:52.967 --> 34:57.437
because they are constrained
by the political realities.

34:57.504 --> 34:58.874
A couple of years go,

34:58.973 --> 35:00.813
we got a call
from a person named Jackie,

35:00.874 --> 35:04.314
who claimed that she was
a former NASA employee.

35:04.411 --> 35:06.651
And she went on with this profound story

35:06.747 --> 35:09.817
about how our rovers

35:09.917 --> 35:12.987
had sent back pictures
that NASA has suppressed

35:13.053 --> 35:17.793
of humans on Mars walking around.

35:17.858 --> 35:19.418
And she was very compelling.

35:19.493 --> 35:22.663
She seemed to know exactly
what she was talking about.

35:22.763 --> 35:26.473
There's always been a theory
that there's a space program

35:26.567 --> 35:29.597
beyond the space program that we know.

35:29.670 --> 35:31.400
It's a black ops program.

35:31.505 --> 35:35.135
It's the program where trillions
of dollars merely disappear,

35:35.209 --> 35:38.239
and nobody knows where the money went.

35:38.312 --> 35:40.752
And nobody knows what's going on.

35:40.814 --> 35:43.854
A Scottish hacker named Gary McKinnon

35:43.951 --> 35:46.021
actually hacked into the NASA database,

35:46.120 --> 35:48.050
and discovered a file,
which contained a list

35:48.122 --> 35:50.592
of what were called
non-terrestrial officers--

35:50.657 --> 35:52.387
officers in the military
that were actually

35:52.493 --> 35:55.063
living and working
off of the planet Earth.

35:55.129 --> 35:58.299
Now, "non-terrestrial"
doesn't necessarily mean "Mars."

35:58.399 --> 36:00.269
But it does mean "out in space."

36:00.367 --> 36:02.797
And what that indicates
is that there is some kind

36:02.903 --> 36:04.573
of top-secret space program

36:04.671 --> 36:06.641
that exists that the public
doesn't know about.

36:08.375 --> 36:09.835
Could there really be

36:09.943 --> 36:13.283
a secret U.S. military
operation on Mars?

36:13.380 --> 36:17.850
If so, just how long
has it been going on?

36:17.918 --> 36:22.248
Some researchers suggest
that a feasible plan

36:22.356 --> 36:25.016
to get to Mars was conceived

36:25.125 --> 36:27.825
well before we even made it to the moon

36:27.928 --> 36:31.398
and by the same scientist
that got us there.

36:31.465 --> 36:34.395
Wernher Von Braun was a rocket genius,

36:34.468 --> 36:37.368
and he was obsessed with going to Mars.

36:37.438 --> 36:39.098
He was obsessed with rocketry.

36:39.206 --> 36:42.706
And he wrote a book in 1948
called The Mars Project.

36:42.810 --> 36:46.450
And it's basically a 91-page
manual on how to get to Mars.

36:46.547 --> 36:49.347
It has all the computations worked out,

36:49.450 --> 36:52.650
all the formulas for
what home and transfer orbits

36:52.753 --> 36:54.623
you need to use to get to Mars.

36:54.721 --> 36:56.621
He actually projected

36:56.723 --> 36:59.933
that he could put
people on Mars by 1965.

37:00.027 --> 37:02.327
Everything he put in that 91-page manual

37:02.429 --> 37:04.899
is actually still valid today.

37:04.998 --> 37:08.898
Wernher Von Braun outlined our plan

37:09.002 --> 37:11.142
to go to Mars and colonize it.

37:11.238 --> 37:14.868
Well, everybody thinks,
"Well, we just never did that."

37:14.975 --> 37:17.905
There are other people that
think we took his playbook

37:18.011 --> 37:20.511
and that we indeed did colonize Mars,

37:20.614 --> 37:23.354
and that we have
a colony of astronauts there

37:23.450 --> 37:27.550
right now under his tutelage
when he was alive.

37:27.621 --> 37:29.921
There's compelling evidence

37:29.990 --> 37:32.660
that Von Braun was working secretly

37:32.726 --> 37:34.486
with elements of the U.S. government

37:34.595 --> 37:37.525
in an attempt to try to make it to Mars.

37:37.631 --> 37:41.771
Is it possible that was done?

37:41.869 --> 37:43.839
Do you think it's possible
that the government

37:43.904 --> 37:44.904
could keep something a secret?

37:45.005 --> 37:46.505
Absolutely.

37:46.607 --> 37:48.437
Go back to the Manhattan Project.

37:48.542 --> 37:51.782
When they developed
the nuclear bomb, there was over

37:51.879 --> 37:56.009
140,000 personnel
involved in that program.

37:56.083 --> 37:58.723
No one squealed.

37:58.819 --> 38:00.119
No one said what they were doing

38:00.220 --> 38:02.620
and many of those people
were unaware of what

38:02.723 --> 38:06.063
they were working on until
the bomb itself was detonated.

38:06.160 --> 38:08.930
So Von Braun could've been working

38:08.996 --> 38:11.096
on a secret Mars program,

38:11.165 --> 38:12.755
and with the same level of secrecy

38:12.866 --> 38:14.396
as the Manhattan Project,

38:14.501 --> 38:17.241
it still to this day
could be highly classified

38:17.304 --> 38:20.844
and never released
to the public at large.

38:20.941 --> 38:24.681
Werner Von Braun's genius is credited

38:24.778 --> 38:29.548
with being the reason
we ever made it to the moon.

38:29.616 --> 38:33.846
Might he also have orchestrated
a secret mission to Mars?

38:33.954 --> 38:37.864
And if so, what was its purpose?

38:41.295 --> 38:42.595
Torrance, California,

38:42.663 --> 38:45.663
2015.

38:45.733 --> 38:49.973
The board members of a private
space agency lead by Elon Musk,

38:50.037 --> 38:52.067
Space X,

38:52.139 --> 38:55.239
announce that the explicit aim
of the organization

38:55.309 --> 38:59.779
is and always has been
to help humanity colonize Mars.

38:59.847 --> 39:01.907
I do think it is important

39:02.016 --> 39:04.746
that we as a species, as a civilization,

39:04.852 --> 39:08.622
are on a path
to become a true space-far--

39:08.723 --> 39:12.063
a true space-faring civilization
and a multi-planet species.

39:12.126 --> 39:13.686
Elon Musk's position is that humans

39:13.761 --> 39:17.701
cannot survive indefinitely on Earth,

39:17.765 --> 39:20.125
and there are a lot of threats
to the continuation

39:20.201 --> 39:21.771
of human life on Earth--

39:21.836 --> 39:24.436
both from what we're
doing to our own planet,

39:24.538 --> 39:26.808
but also from things like asteroids.

39:26.908 --> 39:29.008
We get a single hit
from an asteroid that's as big

39:29.110 --> 39:32.410
as the one that took out the dinosaurs.

39:32.480 --> 39:35.920
And that, by the way,
is a 100% probability

39:36.017 --> 39:39.747
that that is going to happen,
sooner or later.

39:39.854 --> 39:43.164
Going to Mars, it's a survival instinct.

39:43.257 --> 39:45.657
It's something we know, it's somewhere

39:45.760 --> 39:49.530
in the back of our brains
that we have to do or we die.

39:51.732 --> 39:55.972
I think that's the message
of the ruins of Mars is that

39:56.070 --> 39:58.200
this can happen to you.

39:58.306 --> 40:00.766
And you should think about,
as a species,

40:00.841 --> 40:04.341
ways to ensure that the human
race is not wiped out,

40:04.445 --> 40:06.505
because despite our flaws, we're a very

40:06.614 --> 40:10.354
noble, powerful,
important part of this universe.

40:10.451 --> 40:13.091
It's something that will take us

40:13.187 --> 40:16.187
back to our very beginnings.

40:16.290 --> 40:19.930
And here we'll be really
following in the footsteps

40:19.994 --> 40:24.504
of the ancient astronauts,
who came to Earth.

40:24.598 --> 40:28.128
And ultimately, we will be like them,

40:28.235 --> 40:30.865
being the extraterrestrials ourselves

40:30.972 --> 40:34.672
and colonizing a foreign planet.

40:34.742 --> 40:38.342
When we colonize Mars,

40:38.412 --> 40:40.482
it's a retracing of ancient footsteps.

40:40.548 --> 40:43.178
It will be a reconnection
and a remembering

40:43.284 --> 40:46.024
of where we came from.

40:46.087 --> 40:49.147
And it may be that colonizing Mars

40:49.256 --> 40:51.956
will be our ultimate salvation.

40:54.628 --> 40:57.758
Mars is a very, very logical point,

40:57.865 --> 41:02.625
if life on Earth ever should
become impossible,

41:02.737 --> 41:07.007
that's our next step where to go
if the survival of our species

41:07.074 --> 41:09.214
is at the forefront.

41:09.276 --> 41:12.436
Because maybe that's where we came from.

41:12.546 --> 41:15.846
So maybe we earthlings are the Martians.

41:15.950 --> 41:19.450
Then the question is

41:19.520 --> 41:21.850
has this game been going back and forth

41:21.956 --> 41:24.656
for hundreds of thousands of years?

41:26.725 --> 41:27.785
Is it possible

41:27.895 --> 41:29.855
that the colonization of Mars

41:29.964 --> 41:33.604
is the key to our continued survival?

41:33.701 --> 41:36.141
And if so, have we stood

41:36.237 --> 41:38.737
on this precipice before?

41:38.806 --> 41:41.266
Could there have been a human presence

41:41.342 --> 41:44.882
on Mars thousands of years ago?

41:44.945 --> 41:47.405
Perhaps we will discover

41:47.515 --> 41:50.045
the truth about our alien ancestors

41:50.151 --> 41:52.821
when we become the extraterrestrials

41:52.887 --> 41:55.047
on Mars.
