03:11.305 --> 03:13.627
She was possessed and died
during an exorcism.

03:13.707 --> 03:16.297
It happened four days ago, but they're
being arrested and charged now.

03:16.377 --> 03:18.201
- For murder.
- Why murder?

03:18.281 --> 03:20.336
Because the autopsy report
said it was a homicide.

03:20.416 --> 03:22.538
Really, Nic, a possessed nun story?

03:22.618 --> 03:27.204
She was tied to a cross for three days,
given no food or water. They crucified her.

03:27.289 --> 03:29.272
She was only 23.

03:30.543 --> 03:33.073
Actually, I managed to speak to the priest's
lawyer this morning and he said...

03:33.153 --> 03:36.453
- ...he could set up an interview for me.
- Rule number one, editors assign stories.

03:36.533 --> 03:38.589
Good journalists find them.
You taught me that.

03:38.669 --> 03:41.023
- We both know why you're doing this.
- It's a good story.

03:41.103 --> 03:43.861
No, it's another chance for you
to nail faith to the wall...

03:43.941 --> 03:46.730
...and it's not gonna bring your mother back.

03:46.810 --> 03:50.634
We're talking about a priest who murdered
a young woman in the name of religion.

03:50.714 --> 03:52.436
People deserve to know about that.

03:52.516 --> 03:55.534
For a journalist,
you don't sound too objective.

03:57.221 --> 04:00.462
Okay, Uncle Phil,
you want both sides of the story?

04:00.542 --> 04:02.847
How about is this a madman
who murdered a nun...

04:02.927 --> 04:05.379
...or a holy man who lost
a fight with a demon?

04:07.066 --> 04:10.135
Come on. Let me find out.

04:10.215 --> 04:11.657
Please?

04:11.737 --> 04:15.200
All right, you got your shot.
But you're checking in with me.

04:15.280 --> 04:17.647
- Thanks, Phil.
- Mmm.

04:17.726 --> 04:21.129
You have your mother's persistence,
I'll give you that.

04:37.999 --> 04:39.850
Ms. Rawlins.

05:29.888 --> 05:31.744
The doctor had good intentions...

05:31.824 --> 05:35.180
...but you can't take the devil
out of people with pills.

05:35.260 --> 05:37.931
God and I both know where the truth lies.

05:38.465 --> 05:40.280
But you're the one in jail.

05:41.300 --> 05:43.757
Perhaps he feels I'm needed
behind these walls...

05:43.837 --> 05:47.495
...where many have lost their faith
or have none to comfort them.

05:48.475 --> 05:51.765
How do you feel about not
getting the Church's support?

05:52.245 --> 05:54.136
I expected it.

05:54.216 --> 05:56.707
They never liked how I was doing things,
but that's okay.

05:56.787 --> 05:58.607
I was never doing it for them.

05:58.687 --> 06:01.477
I was doing it for God and my congregation.

06:01.757 --> 06:04.417
So why do you think she was
possessed in the first place?

06:04.497 --> 06:07.051
She told me about
a sexual experience she had.

06:08.001 --> 06:10.660
She had given herself to a boy in Germany.

06:11.267 --> 06:14.590
It got her to question her faith,
making her a target.

06:14.670 --> 06:17.703
I'm sure his seduction
was influenced by the devil.

06:18.808 --> 06:22.518
You know, demons are everywhere,
waiting for their opportunity.

06:23.006 --> 06:25.028
They're saying you crucified her.

06:25.108 --> 06:27.727
Only because we had to put her on the cross.

06:27.807 --> 06:29.340
No!

06:32.490 --> 06:36.620
<i>The demon knew our intent and had become
incredibly violent against Adelina.</i>

06:52.444 --> 06:54.700
<i>So we took Adelina into the church.</i>

06:54.780 --> 06:57.342
<i>We wanted her to feel as close
to God as we could get her.</i>

07:08.496 --> 07:11.218
<i>It took a while to get the name
of the demon possessing her...</i>

07:11.298 --> 07:13.187
<i>...but we finally did.</i>

07:13.607 --> 07:17.653
Agares! Agares!

07:22.677 --> 07:25.199
I knew I was dealing
with an incredibly powerful demon...

07:25.279 --> 07:28.169
...because it could use
the name of God and Mother Mary.

07:28.249 --> 07:30.240
Lesser demons can't.

07:30.320 --> 07:32.756
It was at the end of the third day...

07:32.836 --> 07:35.607
...when I could finally feel
the demon starting to give up.

08:18.738 --> 08:22.479
<i>The moment I looked into her eyes,
I knew the exorcism was over.</i>

08:22.559 --> 08:25.398
<i>The demon had seen the conflict
between the bishop and myself...</i>

08:25.478 --> 08:28.201
<i>...and that destroyed everything
I had done up to that moment.</i>

08:28.281 --> 08:30.144
<i>And it wasn't worried anymore.</i>

08:30.224 --> 08:32.707
She'd be alive today if he hadn't interfered.

08:32.787 --> 08:35.072
So what happened?

08:36.089 --> 08:39.710
She was worn out, vulnerable.

08:40.527 --> 08:43.414
The demon took her life
on the way to the hospital.

08:44.265 --> 08:47.089
If I only had a little more time,
she would have been saved.

08:47.169 --> 08:51.327
I understand an exorcist needs years
of experience in order to recognize...

08:51.407 --> 08:53.496
...and deal with the possessed.

08:54.076 --> 08:57.833
- But you haven't had any.
- And neither did Moses...

08:57.913 --> 09:00.999
...but with God's strength
he parted the Red Sea.

09:04.554 --> 09:08.480
I quit my studies because following
the strict rules of the Church...

09:08.560 --> 09:12.248
...wouldn't allow me to help those
who needed it most.

09:12.328 --> 09:14.186
Thanks. That's all I need.

09:16.600 --> 09:18.953
God told me you were here to help.

09:28.780 --> 09:31.972
Because she was so unresponsive,
she was given a high dose of adrenaline...

09:32.052 --> 09:33.440
...when the ambulance arrived.

09:33.520 --> 09:36.247
The autopsy was to determine if perhaps
that was the cause of death.

09:36.327 --> 09:37.910
So how did she die?

09:37.990 --> 09:42.083
Well, basically, her larynx had collapsed,
cutting off the air supply.

09:42.163 --> 09:44.217
Because she was dehydrated?

09:44.497 --> 09:46.953
It might have been some factor,
but not usually.

09:47.033 --> 09:50.423
In most cases, it's strangulation
that causes a collapsed larynx.

09:50.503 --> 09:52.588
She was choked?

09:53.173 --> 09:54.996
There were no bruise marks.

09:55.076 --> 09:58.333
When I dissected the neck area, actually I
thought she might have had some sort of...

09:58.413 --> 10:02.237
...oral or pharyngeal cancer, which,
in some cases, could impinge on the larynx.

10:02.317 --> 10:05.608
But the tissue samples
and the biopsies came back inconclusive...

10:05.688 --> 10:09.141
- ...as I thought they might.
- Why was that?

10:11.059 --> 10:13.511
'Cause I'd never seen anything like it.

10:17.033 --> 10:19.055
I hope you've got a strong stomach.

10:30.148 --> 10:32.670
So if you don't know what this is...

10:32.750 --> 10:35.340
...how can you ever have
a conclusive cause of death?

10:35.420 --> 10:39.778
If we have enough contributing factors,
we can make an educated guess.

10:39.858 --> 10:42.447
And in this case, what that girl
endured for three days...

10:42.527 --> 10:44.699
...definitely contributed to her death.

10:44.779 --> 10:46.835
The photos tell us that much.

10:58.445 --> 11:01.334
How's it going?
Did you get to speak to the priest?

11:01.414 --> 11:04.671
Father Dumitru, yeah. He's adamant
the only reason the nun died...

11:04.751 --> 11:07.975
...is 'cause Bishop Gornik prevented him
from completing the exorcism.

11:08.055 --> 11:10.444
But the coroner I met with
thinks it's murder.

11:10.724 --> 11:14.315
It's her funeral today, so I'm heading up
to Tanacu to see what I can find out.

11:14.395 --> 11:18.680
All right, you take care of yourself,
and, um, call me later.

13:58.572 --> 14:01.462
- Excuse me, Sister?
- Yes?

14:01.542 --> 14:03.350
You were close with Sister Marinescu?

14:03.430 --> 14:05.734
Since we were children.

14:05.814 --> 14:07.970
My name's Nicole Rawlins
and I'm a journalist.

14:08.050 --> 14:09.672
Please just leave us alone.

14:09.752 --> 14:12.507
Look, I'm just curious about
what happened, that's all.

14:12.587 --> 14:15.311
I don't understand
how Father Dumitru could kill her.

14:15.391 --> 14:17.408
They didn't kill her.

17:46.185 --> 17:48.041
What are you doing?

17:49.321 --> 17:51.578
- I'm sorry. I didn't mean to intrude.
- You have to leave now.

17:51.658 --> 17:53.681
- I just wondering if you could help me...
- This way.

17:53.761 --> 17:56.084
...by answering a few questions
about the death of Sister Marinescu.

17:56.164 --> 17:58.281
This way. Now.

18:35.940 --> 18:38.362
Hi. Do you have a room available?

18:38.442 --> 18:40.926
- Yes, of course.
- Great.

18:42.480 --> 18:46.305
You don't know what's going on outside,
do you? What's with all the masks?

18:46.385 --> 18:48.759
They are setting up for the Strigoi Festival.

18:48.839 --> 18:52.276
- And what's that?
- A long time ago, once a year...

18:52.356 --> 18:56.243
...villagers would exhume the body of
someone they thought to be an evil person...

18:56.323 --> 18:57.749
...and remove the heart.

18:57.829 --> 19:02.922
Then they would burn it, mix the ashes
with water from the local well and drink it.

19:03.002 --> 19:05.325
They wore masks to cover their faces...

19:05.405 --> 19:08.242
...protecting their identity from dead souls.

19:08.322 --> 19:11.948
But now it's just another celebration
to drink and have fun...

19:12.028 --> 19:14.702
...I suppose a lot like your...
how do you say...

19:14.782 --> 19:16.103
- Halloween.
- Yes.

19:16.183 --> 19:18.639
And how many nights will you be staying?

19:18.719 --> 19:22.308
- Can I kind of let you know as I go?
- Yes, of course.

20:02.900 --> 20:06.192
By lighting the prayer candles,
we not only pray...

20:06.572 --> 20:10.228
...but our prayers become symbols
of the one light of Christ.

20:10.308 --> 20:13.221
Light also affirms the power of goodness...

20:13.301 --> 20:15.611
...over the darkness of evil.

20:15.980 --> 20:19.089
- I'm Father Anton.
- Nicole Rawlins.

20:19.169 --> 20:20.991
Is there someone you'd like to pray for?

20:21.071 --> 20:24.160
Actually, I came in here
hoping to talk to you.

20:24.240 --> 20:26.646
I saw you at Sister Marinescu's funeral.

20:26.726 --> 20:28.912
You mind if I ask you a few questions?

20:32.800 --> 20:36.219
Do you think Father Dumitru
was responsible for her death?

20:38.072 --> 20:42.496
I don't think it would really be fair for me
to say anything because I wasn't there.

20:42.576 --> 20:46.507
Do you think it would be fair to say
that if he truly felt she was possessed...

20:46.587 --> 20:49.088
...then it was his faith that killed her?

20:49.168 --> 20:52.369
You sound like you don't
have a lot of faith in faith.

20:52.955 --> 20:56.211
Faith is taught, it's not
something you're born with...

20:56.291 --> 20:59.598
...so whatever you end up
believing defines your actions.

20:59.678 --> 21:03.055
Yes, but God gave you free will.

21:03.135 --> 21:06.417
It's your choice to accept
those teachings or not.

21:08.370 --> 21:11.197
There was a nun with brown hair
crying over the casket.

21:11.277 --> 21:14.244
- Yes, Sister Vaduva.
- And the man standing next to her?

21:14.324 --> 21:17.704
The man was Adelina's brother,
Stefan Marinescu.

21:17.784 --> 21:21.125
- Do they live nearby?
- Yes. He owns a vineyard north of town.

21:21.205 --> 21:25.009
Sister Vaduva said
that "they" didn't kill her.

21:26.189 --> 21:29.261
Is there something going on here that
the Church doesn't want her to talk about?

21:29.341 --> 21:31.950
I think if you want to know
the Church's response to all of this...

21:32.030 --> 21:33.685
...you should speak with Bishop Gornik.

21:33.765 --> 21:38.124
Father Dumitru's monastery was under his
governance and sanctifying responsibility.

21:38.204 --> 21:41.359
You can find him at the Saint Joseph
Cathedral in Bucharest.

21:43.409 --> 21:48.201
I'm curious, is it normal to tie someone
to a cross during an exorcism?

21:48.281 --> 21:51.037
No. I hope you find what you're looking for.

21:51.117 --> 21:52.968
Good night.

23:30.358 --> 23:32.982
Please, take a seat.

23:33.662 --> 23:35.483
I appreciate you seeing me.

23:36.664 --> 23:38.654
I'm sorry about yesterday.

23:38.734 --> 23:42.425
It wasn't the right time
or place for either of us.

23:42.505 --> 23:44.761
I apologize as well.

23:44.841 --> 23:48.892
What happened has been
very disturbing for all of us.

23:49.778 --> 23:52.836
I understand that you have some questions.

23:53.216 --> 23:54.871
Yes, um...

23:54.951 --> 23:59.040
...I'd like to know why the Church
isn't defending Father Dumitru's actions.

23:59.422 --> 24:02.474
Exorcisms aren't out of the ordinary
within your Church.

24:06.263 --> 24:08.457
Why don't we take a walk.

24:10.268 --> 24:13.257
After the collapse
of Communism 20 years ago...

24:13.337 --> 24:15.964
...and people could practice
religion again...

24:16.044 --> 24:19.765
...there was a surge of monasteries
and churches being built...

24:19.845 --> 24:23.898
...so many that the Church
couldn't train clergy fast enough.

24:25.550 --> 24:28.240
Father Dumitru was one of them.

24:30.120 --> 24:33.046
I'm actually the one who ordained him.

24:33.126 --> 24:35.648
Had he ever performed an exorcism before?

24:35.728 --> 24:39.854
Yes, and that was another issue
we had with him.

24:39.934 --> 24:43.692
Some priests might perform
one or two exorcisms a year...

24:43.772 --> 24:45.861
...and many none at all.

24:46.441 --> 24:49.463
He's done four in the last ten months.

24:49.543 --> 24:51.366
Why so many?

24:51.446 --> 24:56.572
Mostly because the poor in that area
often turn to the Church to cure ills...

24:56.652 --> 25:00.742
...before they go to Romania's
broken-down healthcare system.

25:00.822 --> 25:03.578
Sister Marinescu wasn't possessed.

25:03.658 --> 25:05.564
She was mentally ill.

25:06.963 --> 25:10.319
I should have just terminated
his services a long time ago.

25:10.399 --> 25:12.855
Then none of this would have happened.

25:13.435 --> 25:15.591
You have no idea how hard I prayed...

25:15.671 --> 25:18.796
...that he would see the light
and change his ways.

25:18.876 --> 25:20.363
It sickens me...

25:20.443 --> 25:24.657
...that deceit sometimes hides
in the garments of the holy.

25:29.154 --> 25:30.709
- Hey.
- <i>Getting anywhere?</i>

25:30.789 --> 25:33.669
Yes, I spoke to Bishop Gornik
and he said he stopped the exorcism...

25:33.749 --> 25:36.814
<i>...'cause the nun wasn't possessed and it
looked like Father Dumitru was killing her.</i>

25:36.894 --> 25:40.151
Didn't the priest need to get the Church's
approval for the exorcism first?

25:40.231 --> 25:43.889
Supposed to, but apparently they've had
a lot of problems with him in the past.

25:43.969 --> 25:47.559
Phil, this isn't the first time he's performed
an exorcism on someone who didn't need it.

25:47.639 --> 25:51.264
I guess this is beginning to look more like
a madman who murdered a nun story, huh?

25:51.344 --> 25:53.009
<i>I'd say so.</i>

25:53.879 --> 25:56.169
It's brutal what happened to her.

25:56.449 --> 25:59.739
Anyway, I'm heading back over to the
monastery to see what else I can find out.

25:59.819 --> 26:03.526
<i>All right, you take care of yourself,
and, uh, call me later.</i>

30:26.942 --> 30:29.961
I am so going to hell.

30:36.352 --> 30:38.635
I almost didn't recognize you.

30:43.761 --> 30:45.849
Have you got a minute?

30:45.929 --> 30:49.571
I'm still having a hard time believing
they couldn't see she was dying...

30:50.151 --> 30:51.956
...how they could do that to her.

30:52.036 --> 30:55.194
Because from their perspective,
they weren't doing anything to her.

30:55.274 --> 30:58.158
They were trying to stop
the demon from doing it.

30:59.244 --> 31:02.915
No exorcism is the same, but there are
different stages to follow...

31:02.995 --> 31:06.472
...once we know that the victim
is, in fact, possessed.

31:06.952 --> 31:09.842
<i>The first is what we refer to
as the "presence."</i>

31:09.922 --> 31:13.979
<i>It's important to find out who
the demon is so you can cast it out.</i>

31:14.059 --> 31:17.150
<i>In most cases, it has control of the body...</i>

31:17.230 --> 31:20.226
<i>...like denying it food and water.</i>

31:20.306 --> 31:22.890
The second we call the "breakpoint."

31:22.970 --> 31:25.592
There's usually complete panic, confusion...

31:25.672 --> 31:29.192
...accompanied by hallucinations,
noises and odors.

31:30.444 --> 31:32.934
<i>The next is called the "clash."</i>

31:33.314 --> 31:36.003
<i>The exorcist is now
in direct battle with the demon...</i>

31:36.083 --> 31:40.791
<i>...as it wants to stay in the victim
as a resident or it must return to hell.</i>

31:42.991 --> 31:46.015
<i>The last and final stage
is referred to as the "expulsion."</i>

31:46.795 --> 31:50.887
In the supreme triumph of God's will,
the demon leaves in the name of Jesus...

31:50.967 --> 31:52.989
...because it's been identified.

31:53.069 --> 31:56.888
But Adelina died. Why would he kill her?

31:58.175 --> 32:00.596
<i>He didn't need her any more.</i>

32:00.676 --> 32:04.266
<i>One dead nun, five other
clergy in jail for murder...</i>

32:04.346 --> 32:07.061
<i>...another dark stain
on the fabric of the Church.</i>

32:07.141 --> 32:10.255
And not being exorcised,
it was free to possess again.

32:10.755 --> 32:14.401
- Demons can possess again?
- It's called transference...

32:14.481 --> 32:17.186
...the demon moving
from one vessel to another.

32:17.496 --> 32:20.533
Sometimes it's merely through
physical contact with the possessed...

32:20.613 --> 32:24.189
...but most often, it possesses
through a weakened soul.

32:24.269 --> 32:28.489
The possessed reflect the demon's
anger and its black soul.

32:34.247 --> 32:38.467
It has some pretty good information
about demons that you might find useful.

32:44.058 --> 32:46.028
What are these?

32:47.827 --> 32:50.445
Sometimes demons have help.

32:54.153 --> 32:58.193
My mother used to say rays
of sunshine are the fingers of God...

32:58.273 --> 33:00.628
...giving guidance and showing the way.

33:27.136 --> 33:28.394
What?

34:34.643 --> 34:36.706
Come on.

35:49.057 --> 35:50.595
Hi.

35:54.763 --> 35:57.620
I told you yesterday that
I don't want to speak with you.

35:57.700 --> 36:01.825
I know, and I'm sorry. But you said
to me it wasn't Father Dumitru...

36:01.905 --> 36:04.156
There's nothing more to be said.

36:04.908 --> 36:06.759
It's God's will.

36:08.803 --> 36:10.430
What about your will?

36:11.556 --> 36:13.833
Father Dumitru killed your friend.

36:18.290 --> 36:20.141
There is nothing I can do.

36:24.363 --> 36:26.484
It's Stefan, right?

36:26.564 --> 36:29.889
If Father Dumitru
didn't kill Adelina, who did?

36:29.969 --> 36:34.873
What do you care? All you people want
to do is to print lies about my sister.

36:34.953 --> 36:38.598
- You don't care what we have to say.
- And what is that?

36:38.778 --> 36:40.468
She wasn't sick in the head.

36:40.548 --> 36:44.205
Look, if you've got something to say,
then I want to help you.

36:44.685 --> 36:49.090
Please, if Father Dumitru and the nuns
didn't kill your sister, then who did?

36:49.722 --> 36:51.406
Tell me.

36:53.093 --> 36:54.911
It was the demon.

36:57.030 --> 36:58.848
It spoke to me.

37:13.215 --> 37:14.799
Adelina?

37:33.405 --> 37:34.988
Adelina.

37:54.259 --> 37:55.770
Adelina.

38:21.690 --> 38:23.207
Adelina!

38:55.860 --> 38:59.104
Whatever was inside of her
was challenging me too.

38:59.184 --> 39:00.948
Testing my faith.

39:01.966 --> 39:05.423
I've never felt anything
so evil in my entire life.

39:05.503 --> 39:08.894
Adelina had been in Germany
for the last year...

39:08.974 --> 39:10.707
...working as a nanny...

39:10.787 --> 39:14.566
...for a family who had just adopted
two kids from the orphanage.

39:14.646 --> 39:17.803
Before she went to work for them,
the German embassy...

39:17.883 --> 39:20.834
...asked her to take a complete
psychological exam.

39:20.914 --> 39:23.171
It's the country's policy.

39:24.925 --> 39:26.742
She passed.

39:27.160 --> 39:29.017
Why'd she come back?

39:29.597 --> 39:32.553
She wanted to return to the monastery.

39:32.633 --> 39:35.455
She wanted to work at the orphanage.

39:36.035 --> 39:38.826
And nothing had happened in Germany?

39:38.906 --> 39:42.865
No. It all started when she got back.

39:42.945 --> 39:47.602
The first thing Adelina wanted to do was
go see Father Gabrielle and give him a gift.

39:48.682 --> 39:51.270
He liked to collect
porcelain figurines of animals.

39:51.350 --> 39:53.273
I'm sorry, who's Father Gabrielle?

39:53.353 --> 39:57.814
He was a priest who really looked out for us
when we were young at the orphanage.

39:58.894 --> 40:01.450
He and Adelina were especially close.

40:01.530 --> 40:05.655
When we left and he became a bishop,
we never saw him anymore...

40:05.735 --> 40:10.794
...except when he would come and stay
at the monastery for work and prayer.

40:10.874 --> 40:12.425
Stefan!

40:20.184 --> 40:21.772
Adelina!

40:37.552 --> 40:41.991
STEFAN <i>He performed exorcisms.
We wish he could have helped Adelina.</i>

41:13.142 --> 41:14.764
No!

41:20.550 --> 41:23.940
<i>Father Gabrielle threw himself
off the bell tower.</i>

41:24.020 --> 41:27.845
<i>We don't know what could have
driven him to commit the ultimate sin.</i>

41:28.925 --> 41:33.513
<i>We watched as Adelina
cradled him in her arms as he died.</i>

41:43.240 --> 41:45.330
We were all devastated.

41:45.810 --> 41:48.233
But Adelina took it the hardest.

41:48.313 --> 41:50.368
He'd been like a father to her.

41:50.448 --> 41:52.939
We don't know why he was even up there.

41:53.419 --> 41:55.704
He never rang the bell before.

41:57.090 --> 42:01.536
Afterwards, I'd always find
Adelina in the church, crying.

42:02.328 --> 42:04.380
She was so upset.

42:06.133 --> 42:08.952
Then one time,
we were all heading in for Mass...

42:10.376 --> 42:12.264
<i>...she refused to go in.</i>

42:44.174 --> 42:46.864
<i>It got a lot worse after that.</i>

43:23.023 --> 43:25.972
<i>Phil, she described some really
disturbing things that happened.</i>

43:26.052 --> 43:29.776
- Did you believe her?
- Well, I believe she believes what she saw.

43:29.856 --> 43:33.825
I guess when you're in the land of vampires
and werewolves, anything could happen.

43:34.505 --> 43:36.346
Yeah, I guess so.

43:42.470 --> 43:45.289
I read your piece on unanswered prayers.

43:47.809 --> 43:50.097
I went online.

43:53.348 --> 43:55.138
Thank you.

44:08.965 --> 44:11.636
For someone who doesn't
believe in God, I'm...

44:11.716 --> 44:16.360
...I'm curious why you are trying so hard
to convince others to believe the same.

44:16.440 --> 44:18.892
Free will, remember?

44:22.680 --> 44:26.271
It was interesting,
the number of people you quoted...

44:26.351 --> 44:30.777
...who had prayed to God to help them
but their prayers went unheard.

44:31.257 --> 44:33.595
What about the prayers that were heard?

44:33.675 --> 44:37.983
The miracles, the miraculous healings
that have occurred over the centuries?

44:38.063 --> 44:42.116
So it's a selective process
whose prayers God responds to?

44:45.005 --> 44:47.172
Whether it be Satan...

44:47.252 --> 44:49.653
...or people's wills or disbelief...

44:50.142 --> 44:52.704
...I think it's important for people
to understand that it's not God...

44:52.784 --> 44:56.452
...who seems so unpredictable.
He's not the one who failed to answer.

44:56.532 --> 44:59.351
We are the ones who have failed to receive.

45:06.761 --> 45:08.978
Why is this so important to you?

45:12.868 --> 45:17.488
I think people only pray because they
believe they can't fix things themselves.

45:18.340 --> 45:19.557
Hmm.

45:23.329 --> 45:26.402
When I was working away
a couple of years ago...

45:26.482 --> 45:28.705
...I got a call from my dad...

45:28.785 --> 45:31.809
...telling me that my mom had cancer.

45:32.989 --> 45:37.297
What he didn't tell me was that she'd
been diagnosed two years earlier...

45:37.627 --> 45:40.919
...and had been trying to beat it
without saying anything to me.

45:41.399 --> 45:43.489
They didn't want me to worry.

45:44.269 --> 45:48.360
I'd been traveling a lot for work,
so I hadn't really been around much.

45:49.340 --> 45:51.332
When I came home...

45:51.412 --> 45:54.034
...I discovered that she was done...

45:54.746 --> 45:59.226
...with the drugs, the chemo...

45:59.306 --> 46:01.166
...the needles...

46:02.187 --> 46:04.844
...and was ready to be, as she put it...

46:05.524 --> 46:07.809
"...cradled in the arms of the Lord."

46:09.695 --> 46:12.147
And my dad was somehow okay with that.

46:13.800 --> 46:17.524
I wasn't so ready to let her go,
so I started researching...

46:17.604 --> 46:21.256
...and I found this new treatment
program that sounded great for her.

46:22.643 --> 46:24.460
She wouldn't even try it.

46:26.346 --> 46:28.099
Said she was in God's hands.

46:30.385 --> 46:34.229
I begged my dad to change her mind,
but he wouldn't do it.

46:35.291 --> 46:37.345
Said we had to honor her wishes.

46:38.125 --> 46:40.412
Said they'd prayed about it together.

46:41.197 --> 46:43.449
So we watched her slowly die.

46:45.468 --> 46:47.319
I was really pissed.

46:49.555 --> 46:54.248
If she didn't have such faith in a stronger
afterlife, she'd probably be alive today.

46:55.378 --> 46:59.398
That treatment program ended up
having a 90 percent success rate.

47:03.021 --> 47:05.843
Her faith made her give up hope.

47:06.323 --> 47:09.013
I think her faith made you lose yours.

47:09.093 --> 47:10.982
She was fine with it.

47:11.462 --> 47:14.453
Her relationship with God is just that, hers.

47:14.533 --> 47:16.351
You shouldn't judge it.

47:17.904 --> 47:20.225
I was trying to save her life.

47:20.305 --> 47:22.329
For you, not her.

47:23.309 --> 47:26.950
I think the problem is,
if you actually found out God existed...

47:27.780 --> 47:30.032
...then you'd have no one to blame.

47:42.029 --> 47:44.053
You need to be careful.

47:45.103 --> 47:48.456
Your rage against God and lack
of faith makes you an easy target...

47:48.536 --> 47:52.102
...especially looking into
what happened to Sister Marinescu.

47:53.208 --> 47:55.292
Has something already happened?

47:56.212 --> 47:59.002
Whether you believe it or not,
demons are real.

47:59.082 --> 48:01.337
There is a heaven and there is a hell...

48:01.417 --> 48:04.340
...and here, now, what's happening
around this incident...

48:04.420 --> 48:07.446
...is a battlefield. You need protection.

48:07.526 --> 48:11.213
- Without faith, you don't have any.
- What about Sister Marinescu?

48:11.293 --> 48:13.545
Did her faith protect her?

48:16.067 --> 48:19.097
- Listen to me...
- It's okay.

48:19.177 --> 48:21.221
I know my own way back.

49:18.418 --> 49:20.251
Are you okay?

49:25.340 --> 49:28.627
That boy standing outside,
you know who he is?

49:29.779 --> 49:32.148
It's Tavian Amanar. He's a Gypsy.

49:35.653 --> 49:37.274
He's slow in the head.

49:37.354 --> 49:39.242
He said to me...

49:40.624 --> 49:42.246
What's that mean?

49:42.326 --> 49:44.648
"It's watching you." But that's impossible.

49:44.728 --> 49:48.148
He can't speak. He was born without a tongue.

49:50.634 --> 49:52.625
Does he live nearby?

49:52.705 --> 49:56.980
Yeah, he lives on a farm with his father.
You passed it coming into Tanacu.

49:58.042 --> 50:00.665
Please stay away from them. They are Gypsies.

50:00.745 --> 50:04.071
They're liars and cheats.
Tourists are easy targets.

50:04.151 --> 50:06.001
He wants something from you.

52:51.598 --> 52:53.726
- <i>Hey, Nic, is everything all right?</i>
- Hey.

52:53.806 --> 52:56.785
- Must be three in the morning there.
- <i>Yeah.</i>

52:58.302 --> 53:01.308
I don't know, it's hard to make sense
out of something that doesn't make sense.

53:01.388 --> 53:03.027
How do you mean?

53:04.678 --> 53:06.496
Earlier I was...

53:08.782 --> 53:10.600
...I just...

53:13.186 --> 53:15.210
...I guess I'm just tired is all.

53:15.990 --> 53:18.547
You know what, I'll call you
back in the morning, okay?

53:18.627 --> 53:22.646
All right. You get some rest.
We'll speak then.

53:31.642 --> 53:35.098
- <i>You had me a little worried last night.</i>
- Yeah, sorry about that.

53:35.178 --> 53:39.336
Seriously, Nic, if this is too much for you,
we don't need this story that badly.

53:39.416 --> 53:43.107
No, I'm fine, really. Actually, I'm already
on my way to go see this Gypsy boy...

53:43.187 --> 53:45.143
...who seems connected to what's going on...

53:45.223 --> 53:48.012
...and, uh, and then I'm gonna
head back to Sister Vaduva's place.

53:48.092 --> 53:50.614
All right. Let me know how it goes.

53:50.694 --> 53:52.905
<i>Okay, no problem.</i>

55:01.003 --> 55:03.094
<i>Thank you for coming back.</i>

55:03.374 --> 55:06.031
We just want people to understand the truth.

55:06.711 --> 55:08.722
Adelina was ashamed...

55:09.310 --> 55:11.346
...of what it was making her do.

55:12.649 --> 55:16.374
She said that the devil kept telling her
what a sinful person she was.

55:16.454 --> 55:18.271
And was she?

55:20.225 --> 55:22.309
Stefan doesn't know this.

55:23.829 --> 55:27.889
But I got a letter from Adelina a couple
of months before she came home.

55:29.169 --> 55:33.589
She had met a boy
in Germany and fell in love.

55:35.274 --> 55:37.292
He said he wanted to marry her.

55:38.813 --> 55:41.702
She was torn between her feelings for him...

55:42.282 --> 55:44.367
...and her commitment to God.

55:45.803 --> 55:48.271
She ended up giving herself to him.

55:49.924 --> 55:54.249
Afterwards, she realized he was
just lying to trick her into bed.

55:54.829 --> 55:58.453
She came back here
to ask for God's forgiveness.

55:59.233 --> 56:02.653
Instead, she got the devil.

56:54.328 --> 56:56.215
<i>We didn't know what to do.</i>

56:56.295 --> 57:00.330
<i>So Sister Lina and I
put all sorts of crosses...</i>

57:00.410 --> 57:04.453
<i>...icons and jars of holy water
in the room where she was sleeping.</i>

57:46.751 --> 57:49.372
How did she get diagnosed with schizophrenia?

57:49.752 --> 57:53.557
One night, after we had all gone to bed...

59:06.554 --> 59:08.762
Stefan rushed Adelina to hospital.

59:08.842 --> 59:12.583
He was upset with what had happened, so...

59:12.663 --> 59:15.534
...he told the doctors everything
that had been going on.

59:16.514 --> 59:19.981
They were the ones
who insisted she see Dr. Funar.

59:20.786 --> 59:22.808
She was the psychologist
who said that Adelina...

59:22.888 --> 59:25.372
...had been suffering from schizophrenia.

59:26.775 --> 59:29.059
Were you part of the exorcism?

59:30.563 --> 59:32.814
Not directly, no.

59:34.066 --> 59:35.291
But I was there.

59:40.276 --> 59:42.194
<i>I was terrified.</i>

59:42.274 --> 59:44.431
<i>Water was falling everywhere.</i>

59:44.711 --> 59:46.528
<i>What do you mean?</i>

59:48.249 --> 59:50.739
<i>The demon was making it rain...</i>

59:51.319 --> 59:53.321
<i>...mocking our use of holy water.</i>

01:00:19.650 --> 01:00:21.405

01:00:21.485 --> 01:00:23.768
...you'll tell them the truth, right?

01:00:26.090 --> 01:00:27.974
Thank you for talking to me.

01:00:49.404 --> 01:00:53.232
<i>Whatever was inside of her
was challenging me too...</i>

01:00:53.312 --> 01:00:55.142
<i>...testing my faith.</i>

01:00:56.023 --> 01:00:59.312
<i>I've never felt anything
so evil in my entire life...</i>

01:00:59.392 --> 01:01:02.003
<i>...or seen such darkness in anyone's eyes.</i>

01:01:02.997 --> 01:01:05.886
<i>Adelina had been in Germany
for the last year...</i>

01:01:06.466 --> 01:01:08.300
<i>...working as a nanny.</i>

01:02:55.217 --> 01:02:57.491
- Hi.
- Are you okay?

01:02:57.921 --> 01:02:59.795
The power went out.

01:03:00.655 --> 01:03:03.709
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt.

01:03:03.789 --> 01:03:05.315
Um...

01:03:05.395 --> 01:03:08.887
...I wasn't happy with the way our
conversation ended the other night.

01:03:09.267 --> 01:03:11.350
I wanted to apologize.

01:03:11.902 --> 01:03:15.189
- It's fine.
- A peace offering.

01:03:17.175 --> 01:03:19.396
Are you trying to trick me into communion?

01:03:20.476 --> 01:03:22.300
I forgot the bread.

01:03:22.780 --> 01:03:25.469
If you have any more questions...

01:03:25.549 --> 01:03:27.634
...you know where to find me.

01:03:28.820 --> 01:03:30.104
Okay.

01:03:32.025 --> 01:03:34.042
How about I open it?

01:03:35.028 --> 01:03:38.648
Actually, uh, you open it
and I'll get dressed.

01:05:01.720 --> 01:05:03.978
<i>Thank you for making the time
to see me, Dr. Funar.</i>

01:05:04.058 --> 01:05:06.948
<i>You have to understand
something about rural Romania.</i>

01:05:07.028 --> 01:05:09.916
<i>Diseases of the mind, such as
schizophrenia, Tourette Syndrome...</i>

01:05:09.996 --> 01:05:12.071
...and other forms of psychosis...

01:05:12.151 --> 01:05:15.025
...are typically regarded
as sure-fire signs...

01:05:15.805 --> 01:05:19.494
...that some sort of diabolical
infestation is taking place.

01:05:19.974 --> 01:05:23.098
Well, her brother said she'd never shown
signs of anything like this before.

01:05:23.178 --> 01:05:25.767
There may not be any family
history of schizophrenia...

01:05:25.847 --> 01:05:30.520
...but there is definitely some mental
history that played into my diagnosis.

01:05:30.600 --> 01:05:32.553
I believe that Father Gabrielle's death...

01:05:32.633 --> 01:05:35.944
...reignited all those old fears
of her early childhood...

01:05:36.024 --> 01:05:39.784
...with what happened with her father's
suicide and her mother's abandonment.

01:05:39.864 --> 01:05:41.911
Her father killed himself?

01:05:43.234 --> 01:05:45.421
Yes, and she saw him do it.

01:05:45.501 --> 01:05:48.192
That's how Adelina ended up in an orphanage.

01:05:49.372 --> 01:05:50.810
The death of the parent...

01:05:50.890 --> 01:05:54.553
...is one of the most difficult
experiences a child can go through...

01:05:54.633 --> 01:05:56.467
...let alone abandonment.

01:06:12.397 --> 01:06:15.617
It was in this ward that we treated Adelina.

01:06:23.276 --> 01:06:26.500
Father Gabrielle's death
triggered delusions...

01:06:26.580 --> 01:06:29.938
...and hallucinations
and ultimately schizophrenia...

01:06:31.118 --> 01:06:33.937
...which should have surfaced
a long time ago.

01:06:36.490 --> 01:06:39.674
She was having episodes
right here in the hospital.

01:06:39.754 --> 01:06:43.251
She thought we were all demons,
trying to kill her.

01:07:50.604 --> 01:07:53.461
<i>Demons are everywhere,
waiting for their opportunity.</i>

01:07:53.541 --> 01:07:56.296
Sister Marinescu wasn't possessed.

01:07:56.376 --> 01:07:58.427
She was mentally ill.

01:08:00.133 --> 01:08:03.405
<i>It's called transference, the demon
moving from one vessel to another.</i>

01:08:03.485 --> 01:08:06.442
<i>But most often it possesses
through a weakened soul.</i>

01:08:06.522 --> 01:08:08.971
God told me you were here to help.

01:08:55.908 --> 01:08:58.264
<i>You're not far. I won't be long.</i>

01:08:58.344 --> 01:09:00.228
Thank you.

01:10:39.521 --> 01:10:42.543
Nicole! Hey!

01:10:42.723 --> 01:10:44.575
Are you okay?

01:10:57.473 --> 01:11:00.729
Running away from this
is exactly what it wants...

01:11:00.809 --> 01:11:02.832
...because somehow you're part of it.

01:11:02.912 --> 01:11:06.565
- I'm not staying.
- You think it's going to go away?

01:11:07.985 --> 01:11:11.408
Embracing fear is exactly
what the darkness wants.

01:11:12.188 --> 01:11:14.007
But by embracing faith...

01:11:16.059 --> 01:11:18.215
...you have something to fight it with.

01:11:18.295 --> 01:11:21.948
A shield. God's been reaching out to you.

01:11:23.267 --> 01:11:25.623
- He wanted you here.
- To do what?

01:11:25.703 --> 01:11:28.961
I don't know. Maybe just forgive yourself.

01:11:29.041 --> 01:11:32.126
But you're not going to find
any answers running away.

01:11:33.012 --> 01:11:34.560
Let me help you.

01:11:34.640 --> 01:11:38.638
That was the rental company. They said
there was nothing wrong with your car.

01:11:38.718 --> 01:11:40.540
It started right up.

01:11:41.320 --> 01:11:43.738
They're going to drop it out front for you.

01:11:47.627 --> 01:11:50.910
You're safe here, I promise.

01:11:58.405 --> 01:12:00.418
I was in the hospital...

01:12:00.998 --> 01:12:03.199
...with my mom the night she died.

01:12:05.012 --> 01:12:07.503
She knew how I felt about God.

01:12:08.283 --> 01:12:11.739
But she took my hands in hers...

01:12:11.819 --> 01:12:16.440
...and asked me to accept
Jesus as my savior...

01:12:17.593 --> 01:12:21.211
...so the two of us could spend
eternity together.

01:12:27.004 --> 01:12:30.223
Even with her dying, I said no.

01:12:33.227 --> 01:12:35.228
And she took that with her.

01:12:39.016 --> 01:12:41.869
I'd do anything to tell her how sorry I am.

01:13:07.379 --> 01:13:10.638
<i>Whatever's going on here,
I don't want to be a part of it anymore.</i>

01:13:10.718 --> 01:13:12.535
<i>I'm coming home.</i>

01:13:14.221 --> 01:13:16.042
<i>What really happened?</i>

01:13:16.122 --> 01:13:18.547
<i>Is an innocent man in jail?</i>

01:13:19.127 --> 01:13:21.210
I don't know what to think.

01:13:22.163 --> 01:13:26.184
<i>All right. I'll have a ticket
waiting for you at the airport.</i>

01:13:28.437 --> 01:13:31.089
- <i>Nicole?</i>
- Yeah, I'll call you back in a bit.

01:14:35.209 --> 01:14:37.459
Did you know Father Gabrielle?

01:14:40.348 --> 01:14:41.898
No.

01:14:45.152 --> 01:14:47.801
It's the same date my mom died.

01:14:49.456 --> 01:14:52.310
Can you tell me what the inscription reads?

01:14:55.530 --> 01:14:58.326
"Now cradled in the arms of the Lord."

01:15:13.682 --> 01:15:15.672
<i>Demons can possess again?</i>

01:15:15.752 --> 01:15:17.268
It's called transference...

01:15:17.348 --> 01:15:20.010
<i>...the demon moving
from one vessel to another.</i>

01:15:20.090 --> 01:15:23.609
<i>Sometimes it's merely through
physical contact with the possessed.</i>

01:15:26.567 --> 01:15:29.087
Phil, Dumitru's innocent.

01:15:29.167 --> 01:15:31.623
Somehow Father Gabrielle
is a part of all this.

01:15:31.703 --> 01:15:34.241
I've gotta go back to the monastery
and figure this out.

01:15:51.759 --> 01:15:53.776
Are you looking for something?

01:15:57.264 --> 01:16:01.254
Is it true Father Gabrielle died
in Sister Marinescu's arms?

01:16:01.334 --> 01:16:03.019
Yes.

01:16:04.672 --> 01:16:07.324
He used this office when he stayed here.

01:16:10.711 --> 01:16:13.603
What was the last exorcism
he performed before he died?

01:16:13.683 --> 01:16:15.772
No, no, I don't know.

01:16:16.252 --> 01:16:21.520
He used to keep his appointments
in here, and we can look.

01:16:24.463 --> 01:16:27.113
And the last person was...

01:16:28.864 --> 01:16:33.157
- Tavian Amanar.
- Oh, yes. He's a boy who lives around here.

01:16:34.037 --> 01:16:37.490
Yeah, I know who he is.

01:16:45.982 --> 01:16:47.834
Mr. Amanar?

01:16:48.685 --> 01:16:50.709
- Do you speak English?
- Little.

01:16:50.789 --> 01:16:53.555
- Do you mind if I ask you a few questions?
- What about?

01:16:53.635 --> 01:16:55.869
About Father Gabrielle
and what he did for your son.

01:16:55.949 --> 01:16:58.116
He do nothing for Tavian.

01:16:58.829 --> 01:17:01.386
Father Gabrielle didn't come
out here to see your son?

01:17:01.466 --> 01:17:04.490
No, Tavian brought him for me. Why you here?

01:17:04.570 --> 01:17:08.222
I think Father Gabrielle's death is connected
to something that happened here.

01:17:12.444 --> 01:17:16.870
The father tell me my Tavian is very special.

01:17:16.950 --> 01:17:18.572
Strong with God.

01:17:18.652 --> 01:17:21.509
My head have bad, dark thoughts.

01:17:21.589 --> 01:17:22.990
Nothing make me happy.

01:17:23.070 --> 01:17:26.748
My sister tell me it's a curse
and we try to break it...

01:17:26.828 --> 01:17:28.583
...but everything got worse.

01:17:28.663 --> 01:17:32.316
The voice from my head tell me kill my son.

01:17:33.969 --> 01:17:35.757
Almost did.

01:17:35.837 --> 01:17:38.494
Tavian bring me to church for help...

01:17:38.574 --> 01:17:42.009
...but voices said it kill me if I go inside.

01:17:42.089 --> 01:17:44.495
So Tavian bring father here.

01:17:46.348 --> 01:17:50.035
I thank God every day
for what father do for me.

01:17:52.522 --> 01:17:55.379
Did Father Gabrielle
get the name of the demon?

01:17:55.459 --> 01:17:57.320
Don't know.

01:17:57.400 --> 01:18:00.061
Me don't remember anything.

01:18:25.659 --> 01:18:28.547
<i>It took a while to get the name
of the demon possessing her.</i>

01:18:28.627 --> 01:18:30.713
Agares!

01:18:31.832 --> 01:18:34.116
Do you have a phone I can use?

01:18:47.600 --> 01:18:49.220
<i>Anton, I figured it out.</i>

01:18:49.300 --> 01:18:53.008
The last exorcism that Father Gabrielle
performed was on Tavian's father.

01:18:53.088 --> 01:18:55.310
<i>The name of the demon was Agares.</i>

01:18:55.390 --> 01:18:59.782
If Father Gabrielle became possessed by the
demon, he must've transferred it to Adelina.

01:18:59.862 --> 01:19:02.125
Anton, it was transference.

01:19:04.833 --> 01:19:06.351
Nicole!

01:20:21.115 --> 01:20:22.633
Nicole!

01:20:56.422 --> 01:20:59.110
You like preying on the weak,
don't you, demon?

01:20:59.190 --> 01:21:01.621
You're wasting your time.
She has no faith to corrupt.

01:21:04.463 --> 01:21:06.592
You're gonna need more
than this to fight me, demon.

01:21:27.546 --> 01:21:30.212
Anton, it's killing me!

01:21:39.949 --> 01:21:42.490
Nicole, ask for God's help.

01:21:42.570 --> 01:21:44.994
You need to have faith to fight this demon.

01:21:46.744 --> 01:21:49.688
Shut up, demon! Be silent!

01:21:49.768 --> 01:21:53.168
I adjure you. You can make it stop!

01:21:53.248 --> 01:21:55.873
You can make it stop, Nicole.

01:21:56.853 --> 01:21:59.904
Leave her, demon! Leave her now!

01:22:01.760 --> 01:22:05.316
I don't need the Romana or crucifix
to send you back to hell, demon.

01:22:05.396 --> 01:22:08.261
I already know your name. Agares!

01:22:13.505 --> 01:22:16.931
You are done with her, Agares.
I adjure you by the living God...

01:22:17.011 --> 01:22:20.533
...by the Holy God, who so loved
the world that he gave up his only son.

01:22:20.613 --> 01:22:24.416
Begone, Satan's helper,
inventor and master of all deceit.

01:22:24.496 --> 01:22:27.212
Stop deceiving human creatures
and pouring out to them...

01:22:27.292 --> 01:22:28.704
...the poison of eternal damnation.

01:22:28.784 --> 01:22:32.378
Begone, Satan's helper,
enemy of man's salvation.

01:22:32.458 --> 01:22:36.920
Give place to the one Holy Church,
acquired by Christ at the price of his blood.

01:22:42.504 --> 01:22:45.891
You've got to fight back
or you'll never see your mother again.

01:22:45.971 --> 01:22:48.663
You told me she taught you to be a fighter.

01:22:50.761 --> 01:22:52.768
You can do this. Fight back!

01:22:52.848 --> 01:22:55.316
Don't let this demon drag you to hell.

01:22:55.936 --> 01:22:58.575
I can't do this without your help.

01:23:00.155 --> 01:23:02.665
Stoop beneath the all-powerful hand of God.

01:23:02.745 --> 01:23:05.778
Tremble and flee when we invoke
the Holy name of Jesus...

01:23:05.858 --> 01:23:08.351
...this name which causes hell to tremble.

01:23:08.431 --> 01:23:11.620
Holy is the Lord, the God of armies.

01:23:11.700 --> 01:23:13.389
Be gone, demon.

01:23:13.469 --> 01:23:15.887
Agares, be gone.

01:23:34.259 --> 01:23:36.938
Nicole? Come on, Nicole.

01:23:37.228 --> 01:23:38.873
Breathe!

01:23:39.831 --> 01:23:42.888
Nicole. Breathe.

01:24:24.046 --> 01:24:25.864
I saw my mom.
