00:46.714 --> 00:49.341
Now, Eric, they're called
Native Americans, remember?

00:49.467 --> 00:50.843
Show some respect.

00:50.968 --> 00:52.928
Welcome to
the Three Feathers Casino.

00:53.054 --> 00:55.306
I am your host,
Chief Runs With Premise.

00:55.431 --> 00:57.808
Please try your luck
at one of our many games.

00:57.933 --> 00:59.143
All right!
Let's go!

00:59.268 --> 01:02.271
Hup! I am afraid minors
cannot go onto the casino floor.

01:02.396 --> 01:04.815
I'm not a miner, dumbass.
You see a shovel in my hand?

01:04.940 --> 01:07.693
You kids can enjoy
our Native American comedy club.

01:07.818 --> 01:09.278
All right.
We're gonna hit the tables.

01:09.403 --> 01:11.906
Why don't you kids run along
to the comedy club?

01:13.532 --> 01:15.284
All right.
Time to win some money!

01:15.409 --> 01:17.078
Oh, yeah.
Blackjack table!

01:17.203 --> 01:18.621
Welcome to the blackjack table.

01:18.746 --> 01:21.665
May luck run through you
like the spirit of the buffalo.

01:21.791 --> 01:23.417
Gerald, this is $10 a hand!

01:23.542 --> 01:24.710
Relax, sweetie.

01:24.835 --> 01:26.504
I know how to count cards.

01:26.629 --> 01:27.880
Well, I don't want to play here.

01:28.005 --> 01:30.132
Yeah. Come on, Sheila.
Let's go to the nickel slots.

01:30.257 --> 01:31.509
Ooh!
The nickel slots!

01:31.634 --> 01:33.719
You might win the $30 jackpot!

01:35.137 --> 01:37.515
Ah, women, huh?
God, I hate 'em.

01:37.640 --> 01:40.392
All right! Time to show
these people how to gamble!

01:40.518 --> 01:42.645
Welcome to
the Three Feathers Comedy Club.

01:42.770 --> 01:46.315
Please put your hands together
for Johnny Manymoons!

01:47.983 --> 01:50.444
What <i>is</i> Native American comedy,
anyway?

01:51.320 --> 01:53.447
Thank you.
Thank you.

01:53.572 --> 01:55.991
Bear walked into a bar.

01:56.117 --> 01:59.787
Bear said to deer,
"May I please...

02:00.621 --> 02:02.998
...have a drink?"

02:03.124 --> 02:07.169
And so deer said to bear,
"Why the big <i>pause</i>?"

02:08.546 --> 02:11.132
Ha ha ha ha! Ha ha ha ha!

02:11.257 --> 02:12.716
Ha ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha ha!

02:12.842 --> 02:17.429
Many moons ago, pony and eagle
walked up to coyote.

02:17.555 --> 02:21.517
Pony said to coyote,
"I am very mad at eagle.

02:21.642 --> 02:24.103
Will you yell at him for me?"

02:24.228 --> 02:28.149
Coyote said to pony,
"Why can you not yell yourself?"

02:28.274 --> 02:32.361
And pony replied,
"Because I am a little <i>hoarse."</i>

02:33.946 --> 02:36.407
Ha ha ha ha! Ha ha ha ha!

02:39.076 --> 02:40.369
How's it going, Gerald?

02:40.494 --> 02:41.537
Oh, not so good.

02:41.662 --> 02:44.039
Yeah. I know what you mean.
I'm down 300 bucks.

02:44.165 --> 02:45.749
Yeah.
I'm down $26,000.

02:45.875 --> 02:48.794
Yeah. Well, maybe we should --
Wait. $26,000?!

02:48.919 --> 02:51.130
I forgot to tell you.
I have a gambling problem.

02:51.255 --> 02:52.464
Gerald, $26,000 --

02:52.590 --> 02:54.967
Shh! I have to win it back
before Sheila finds out!

02:55.092 --> 02:56.385
Where did you get
that kind of money?

02:56.510 --> 02:57.636
The casino gave me credit.

02:57.761 --> 02:59.180
I put the house up
as collateral.

02:59.305 --> 03:00.806
But I still have this $10 chip!

03:00.931 --> 03:02.725
Dealer 21.
Sorry.

03:03.475 --> 03:06.103
That's it.
I'm destitute.

03:06.228 --> 03:08.022
Loan me money! You've got
to have money in the cup!

03:08.147 --> 03:10.441
W-What's in the cup?
- Just six quarters!

03:10.566 --> 03:11.692
Oh, God.
Oh, Jesus.

03:11.817 --> 03:13.652
Thank you for playing
at Three Feathers.

03:13.777 --> 03:16.113
May your life be filled
with the song of the sparrow.

03:16.238 --> 03:19.033
Oh, shove the song
of the sparrow up your ass!

03:20.868 --> 03:22.453
How am I gonna tell my family?

03:22.578 --> 03:24.163
How do I tell them
that tomorrow,

03:24.288 --> 03:27.082
we have to pack up our things
and get out of the house?

03:27.208 --> 03:28.459
There's Daddy!

03:28.584 --> 03:29.960
Oh, Jesus.

03:30.085 --> 03:32.463
Where have you guys been?
We've been looking all over.

03:32.588 --> 03:33.756
Yeah. Come on, Dad.
This place sucks!

03:33.881 --> 03:34.757
I want to go!

03:34.882 --> 03:36.508
Wha-- What did you say?

03:36.634 --> 03:38.469
I said I want to leave!

03:38.594 --> 03:40.387
Oh!
You want to leave, huh?!

03:40.512 --> 03:41.430
Okay.
Fine, Kyle.

03:41.555 --> 03:43.599
When we get home,
we'll just pack up our things,

03:43.724 --> 03:45.935
load 'em in the car,
and we'll leave!

03:46.060 --> 03:47.061
What?
No, no. I mean --

03:47.186 --> 03:49.396
No, no, no. If you want to
leave South Park, fine!

03:49.521 --> 03:51.190
Tomorrow we're leaving!

03:51.315 --> 03:52.524
Gerald, what are you
talking about?

03:52.650 --> 03:55.444
Oh, you heard him, Sheila.
Kyle wants to leave.

03:55.569 --> 03:58.447
Our nice old house doesn't
"interest" Kyle anymore.

03:58.572 --> 04:01.325
Well, I'm calling
a moving company right now!

04:02.618 --> 04:05.371
Well, you shouldn't be
such a dick, dude.

04:05.496 --> 04:06.789
What's wrong with Gerald?

04:06.914 --> 04:09.750
He -- He lost his house
to the Native Americans.

04:09.875 --> 04:10.626
What?

04:10.751 --> 04:13.045
But don't the Native Americans
know he has nowhere else to go?

04:13.170 --> 04:14.630
They don't care.

04:17.466 --> 04:19.093
Look at them.

04:19.218 --> 04:22.304
Small-minded idiots
pouring their life savings away.

04:22.429 --> 04:25.599
Their cash flows out of them
like diarrhea from the buffalo.

04:25.724 --> 04:29.061
Yes, but we have milked these
simple mountain folk almost dry.

04:29.186 --> 04:31.230
If we really want to see
cash flow,

04:31.355 --> 04:33.816
we need to bring in city people
from Denver.

04:33.941 --> 04:35.359
Yes.

04:35.484 --> 04:38.028
It is time for us to implement
our plan --

04:38.153 --> 04:42.366
a superhighway, built from
Denver right to our casino.

04:42.491 --> 04:45.035
And what do we do about
the small town of South Park

04:45.160 --> 04:46.787
that lies in the highway's way?

04:46.912 --> 04:48.163
Simple.

04:48.289 --> 04:52.126
We buy it...and we demolish it.

04:52.251 --> 04:54.795
Ha ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha ha!

04:54.920 --> 04:56.130
Ha ha ha ha!

04:57.923 --> 04:59.633
And that's really
all I can tell you.

04:59.758 --> 05:01.885
The town of South Park
is going to be leveled

05:02.011 --> 05:04.596
in order to make way
for a 12-lane superhighway.

05:04.722 --> 05:06.473
But how can they do that?

05:06.598 --> 05:07.474
The Native Americans

05:07.599 --> 05:09.184
have purchased the land out
from under us.

05:09.310 --> 05:10.978
Tomorrow they're buying
the last of what they need

05:11.103 --> 05:12.396
to have complete ownership.

05:12.521 --> 05:14.732
Well, can't we stop them?
Let's call the bank!

05:14.857 --> 05:16.317
The Native Americans
bought the bank.

05:16.442 --> 05:18.152
Oh, my God.

05:18.277 --> 05:19.528
Now, look,
it isn't all horrible.

05:19.653 --> 05:21.530
The Native Americans are
offering you retail values

05:21.655 --> 05:22.531
on your homes.

05:22.656 --> 05:23.490
No!
Screw that!

05:23.615 --> 05:25.492
We'll just pool
our money together

05:25.617 --> 05:27.202
and buy the town ourselves!

05:27.328 --> 05:28.662
That's right!
- Yeah!

05:28.787 --> 05:31.040
Yeah! Let the South Park people
own South Park!

05:31.165 --> 05:32.291
Yeah!
- All right!

05:32.416 --> 05:33.959
How much do we have to raise,
Mayor?

05:34.084 --> 05:36.086
$300,000.

05:36.211 --> 05:38.088
Ooh.
- Oh.

05:39.923 --> 05:41.633
Oh.
Never mind.

05:43.052 --> 05:44.428
How can they do that, huh?

05:44.553 --> 05:46.305
How can they make us
all move away?

05:46.430 --> 05:48.265
Because they're rich,
greedy-ass Indians.

05:48.390 --> 05:49.933
Native Americans.

05:50.059 --> 05:52.144
Our whole town, gone.

05:52.269 --> 05:54.855
We've had such great times here.

05:54.980 --> 05:55.814
My God!

05:55.939 --> 05:57.107
Aah!
- Aah!

05:57.232 --> 05:57.983
Oh!

06:04.406 --> 06:05.324
Aah!

06:08.118 --> 06:09.411
We can't let them do it,
you guys!

06:09.536 --> 06:11.330
We have to find a way to stop
those Native Americans!

06:11.455 --> 06:12.331
Yeah!

06:12.456 --> 06:13.582
Yeah.
This is our town!

06:13.707 --> 06:15.501
We shouldn't have to make
new friends somewhere else.

06:15.626 --> 06:16.502
We're a team!
- Yeah!

06:16.627 --> 06:18.003
That's right!
- Yeah, that's right!

06:18.128 --> 06:19.004
Yeah.
We're a team.

06:19.129 --> 06:22.174
We just have to figure out
a way to raise $300,000.

06:22.966 --> 06:24.885
Wait a minute!
I've got it, you guys!

06:25.010 --> 06:27.054
We can get Kyle infected
with AIDS

06:27.179 --> 06:28.514
and then start
a charity organization

06:28.639 --> 06:30.099
that we steal money from!

06:30.224 --> 06:31.850
Come on!
Let's go!

06:36.563 --> 06:38.440
No?
We can't give Kyle AIDS?

06:38.565 --> 06:40.442
We need something that will
get us money tomorrow.

06:40.567 --> 06:43.278
Hey! I know!
How about a dog parade?

06:43.404 --> 06:44.279
Dog parade?
- Yeah.

06:44.405 --> 06:46.115
We dress up all our dogs
in little outfits

06:46.240 --> 06:47.491
and parade them down the street.

06:47.616 --> 06:48.700
It'll be so adorable!

06:48.826 --> 06:50.494
How do we make $300,000
doing that?

06:50.619 --> 06:51.412
Oh.

06:51.537 --> 06:53.580
Well, we could sell tickets
to our moms and dads!

06:53.705 --> 06:55.457
Our moms and dads are the ones
who need money, Butters!

06:55.582 --> 06:56.875
Oh.

06:58.544 --> 07:02.005
Maybe give Kyle AIDS, huh?
Looking a little better now.

07:04.716 --> 07:06.802
Oh, Gerald, I-I can't watch!

07:06.927 --> 07:08.637
How can you do this to people?

07:08.762 --> 07:12.766
We're sorry, but if we do not
build a superhighway,

07:12.891 --> 07:15.561
our casino might stop seeing
profits.

07:15.686 --> 07:17.896
There's more to life
than profits.

07:18.021 --> 07:19.440
Like what?

07:19.565 --> 07:22.734
Well, like, you know...
Slurpees and stuff.

07:25.237 --> 07:26.155
Well, come on, honey.

07:26.280 --> 07:28.699
I guess we should start
packing up our things as well.

07:28.824 --> 07:31.702
Yeah.
So long, South Park.

07:31.827 --> 07:33.328
Mom! Dad!

07:33.454 --> 07:36.081
We figured out a way
we could raise $300,000!

07:36.206 --> 07:38.417
A dog parade?
- No!

07:38.542 --> 07:40.252
Stan, we've all tried
to raise money,

07:40.377 --> 07:43.505
but we only raised $10,000,
and the deadline is tomorrow.

07:43.630 --> 07:45.716
I know, so how about we take
the $10,000

07:45.841 --> 07:47.092
back to the Indian casino?

07:47.217 --> 07:47.968
Tell them, Kyle.

07:48.093 --> 07:50.637
The odds on a single number
in roulette are 35 to 1.

07:50.762 --> 07:54.349
That means with a $10,000 bet,
you win $350,000!

07:54.475 --> 07:55.934
Boys, that's ridiculous.

07:56.059 --> 07:57.603
Look, we-- we've got
nothing to lose.

07:57.728 --> 07:59.938
What do you guys think?
- It's a long shot.

08:00.063 --> 08:04.234
Yeah, but it's the only shot
we've got to save our town.

08:06.778 --> 08:10.282
"The residents of South Park
had hoped to raise $300,000

08:10.407 --> 08:12.451
but in the end managed to raise
only $10,000.

08:12.576 --> 08:14.077
The loss of their town
may be imminent

08:14.203 --> 08:15.579
for the poor people
of South Park."

08:15.704 --> 08:18.373
Aw, I fink I'm going to cwy!

08:18.499 --> 08:20.501
Ha ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha ha!

08:21.168 --> 08:24.379
All right, boys.
You're gonna have to wait here.

08:24.505 --> 08:25.547
Dad.

08:27.216 --> 08:28.759
Good luck.

08:28.884 --> 08:31.386
It's in God's hands now.

08:31.970 --> 08:34.306
Stand aside, everyone!

08:36.767 --> 08:38.310
What are they doing?

08:38.435 --> 08:40.103
We're gonna try to beat you
at your own game,

08:40.229 --> 08:41.855
Chief Runs With Premise!

08:41.980 --> 08:45.359
$10,000 on 31 black.

08:51.907 --> 08:53.492
Impossible.

08:53.617 --> 08:56.203
Come on.
Come on.

09:14.221 --> 09:17.266
31...black.

09:17.391 --> 09:19.226
Yeah!
- Whoo-hoo!

09:19.351 --> 09:20.894
Oh, we did it!
We did it!

09:21.019 --> 09:22.521
Oh, my God!
- Oh, this is amazing!

09:22.646 --> 09:24.856
We did it!
- No! No!

09:26.358 --> 09:27.609
South Park is saved!

09:28.652 --> 09:31.154
We have plenty enough
to save our town now!

09:31.280 --> 09:34.783
Yeah!
But wait. $350,000.

09:34.908 --> 09:38.287
That means if we won again,
it would be $12 1/4 million!

09:39.454 --> 09:41.707
We could save the town
<i>and</i> be super rich!

09:41.832 --> 09:44.835
Oh, hell, yeah!
Let it ride! Let it ride!

09:46.503 --> 09:47.504
What the hell are they doing?!

09:47.629 --> 09:50.007
Let's go, 31!
Let's see it!

09:52.009 --> 09:54.928
2 red.
You lose.

09:55.053 --> 09:56.888
Ohh!

09:57.014 --> 09:58.015
Damn it!

09:58.140 --> 09:59.933
Hm!

10:00.809 --> 10:02.394
They -- They had it!

10:02.519 --> 10:04.313
They freakin' had it!

10:06.732 --> 10:08.567
You totally had it.

10:08.692 --> 10:10.611
You had enough to save the town
and then some.

10:10.736 --> 10:11.945
Stan, okay?

10:12.070 --> 10:14.531
You just don't understand
the fine points of gambling.

10:14.656 --> 10:17.367
You're never supposed to stop
when you're on a winning streak.

10:17.492 --> 10:19.077
A winning streak?!
You played one game!

10:19.202 --> 10:21.330
Stan, okay?
- What?!

10:21.455 --> 10:23.332
All right, Stan.
Okay?

10:23.457 --> 10:25.500
You people just got greedy,
like the Native Americans.

10:26.835 --> 10:29.129
Hey, mister!
We're not like them, all right?!

10:29.254 --> 10:31.256
Now, we may have pie-in-the-sky
dreams once in a while,

10:31.381 --> 10:33.884
but we aren't the ones kicking
people out of their homes.

10:34.009 --> 10:35.969
So don't you compare us
to those coldhearted,

10:36.094 --> 10:38.513
moneygrubbing, evil,
stinky Indians!

10:38.639 --> 10:41.350
I'm sorry -- Native Americans.

10:48.148 --> 10:51.193
There you are, sir.
There's the check for your home.

10:51.318 --> 10:52.694
Just sign here and here.

10:52.819 --> 10:56.031
Well, this is it, Mr. Slave.
We're officially homeless.

10:57.616 --> 11:00.619
Jesus -- Jesus Christ!

11:00.744 --> 11:03.205
Dad, what are you doing?
Don't take their dirty money!

11:03.330 --> 11:04.748
Stanley, we don't have a choice.

11:04.873 --> 11:06.917
The Native Americans own
South Park now.

11:07.042 --> 11:09.461
We have to take what they'll
give us for our homes.

11:09.586 --> 11:12.172
There you go.
Have a nice day.

11:12.839 --> 11:14.966
Come on, you guys.
This is our town!

11:15.092 --> 11:17.511
It's over, Stanley.
What else can we do?

11:17.636 --> 11:20.013
We can stay...and fight.
- Yeah.

11:20.138 --> 11:21.723
When the Indians
come to tear up our town,

11:21.848 --> 11:23.016
we kick 'em in the nuts!

11:23.141 --> 11:23.767
Mrph!

11:23.892 --> 11:26.353
Yeah. They don't own our town.
We do!

11:26.478 --> 11:27.562
I'm sorry, boys.

11:27.688 --> 11:29.398
You just don't understand
economics.

11:29.523 --> 11:30.524
It'll be okay, boys.

11:30.649 --> 11:33.026
We'll just move
to the next town over.

11:33.151 --> 11:33.985
Oh, sure.

11:34.111 --> 11:36.530
Until the Native Americans
decide they want <i>that</i> land, too.

11:36.655 --> 11:38.990
What if the Native Americans
just keep building their casinos

11:39.116 --> 11:41.159
and their highways until
we have nowhere else to go?

11:41.284 --> 11:42.828
We have to stand up to them now!

11:44.955 --> 11:47.249
Oh, forget it.
Come on, you guys!

11:47.374 --> 11:49.626
You're all a bunch
of goddamn pussies!

12:03.557 --> 12:05.142
Get out of our way!

12:05.267 --> 12:07.060
No! We won't let you destroy
our town!

12:07.185 --> 12:09.229
Boys, it isn't your town
anymore.

12:09.354 --> 12:11.148
Just because you have a piece
of paper saying you own it

12:11.273 --> 12:12.149
doesn't make it yours.

12:12.274 --> 12:14.151
We grew up here.
Our parents grew up here.

12:14.276 --> 12:16.611
We shop at that Wal-Mart
and eat at that Chili's.

12:16.737 --> 12:17.946
We take fish from the streams

12:18.071 --> 12:19.906
and bread them and freeze them
to make fish sticks.

12:20.031 --> 12:22.451
This is not just a town.
It is our way of life.

12:22.576 --> 12:25.203
Well, your way of life
is about to change, little boys.

12:25.328 --> 12:26.204
Now, move!

12:26.329 --> 12:28.665
You can't just roll into places
and take people's lives away!

12:28.790 --> 12:32.461
And what are four little boys
going to do to stop us, huh?

they were dealt with!

13:11.082 --> 13:11.958
They were!

13:12.083 --> 13:13.210
Sorry, Charlies!

13:13.335 --> 13:16.838
You can just keep your filthy
bastard Indian money!

13:16.963 --> 13:18.590
Filthy bastard
<i>Native American</i> money.

13:18.715 --> 13:20.759
Oh, right.
Sorry about that!

13:20.884 --> 13:21.927
This isn't over!

13:29.810 --> 13:32.813
We'll never give up!
You bastards!

13:32.938 --> 13:34.898
Yeah.
South Park is ours!

13:35.023 --> 13:36.733
But what do we do now?

13:36.858 --> 13:40.278
I mean, we can't just stand here
and block their way forever.

13:40.403 --> 13:43.698
We can stand here
as long as it takes.

13:53.291 --> 13:55.043
What is the state of our people?

13:55.168 --> 13:57.379
Last night, I spoke with
The Spirit of the Bear,

13:57.504 --> 14:00.382
and Bear said that if we do not
build our superhighway soon,

14:00.507 --> 14:04.135
our investors may soon sell off
their shares of the new casino.

14:04.261 --> 14:07.472
Yes, and Eagle says the
cumulative shared market loss

14:07.597 --> 14:10.809
on the revenue of the new casino
drops 15% every day.

14:10.934 --> 14:13.061
Then we must force
the South Park people

14:13.186 --> 14:14.271
off their petty land.

14:14.396 --> 14:16.106
But they are determined
and proud,

14:16.231 --> 14:18.900
and the Spirit of the Wind
has stated that if we use force,

14:19.025 --> 14:20.569
it could be
a publicity nightmare,

14:20.694 --> 14:22.279
further hurting our net assets.

14:22.404 --> 14:25.448
I already have a plan how we
can force them off their land...

14:25.574 --> 14:26.449
sneakily.

14:26.575 --> 14:30.787
We're going to give them...
blankets!

14:31.371 --> 14:32.330
Blankets?

14:32.455 --> 14:35.208
Yes. We will present the
blankets as a peace offering.

14:35.333 --> 14:37.127
But what the round eyes
will not know

14:37.252 --> 14:40.630
is that the blankets
are infected with SARS!

14:42.132 --> 14:43.341
They will all get SARS,

14:43.466 --> 14:46.386
and then SARS will run through
their town like a buffalo.

14:46.511 --> 14:49.222
Now, I need your help getting
the SARS onto the blankets.

14:50.682 --> 14:52.309
Okay.
Bring them in!

14:55.520 --> 14:58.023
Let's see how South Park
deals with <i>this!</i>

15:01.651 --> 15:04.154
Everyone, grab a Chinese person
and rub them on a blanket.

15:06.031 --> 15:07.490
Make sure you rub them all over!

15:07.616 --> 15:09.284
Get the SARS
nice and deep in there.

15:14.164 --> 15:16.416
Tom, I'm standing
in chilly South Park, Colorado,

15:16.541 --> 15:18.543
where the residents
are entering the third day

15:18.668 --> 15:20.879
of their sit-in to try
and stop Native Americans

15:21.004 --> 15:23.381
from building a superhighway
through their town.

15:23.506 --> 15:26.801
The temperature is low,
but spirits are pretty low, too.

15:30.931 --> 15:32.015
What do <i>they</i> want?

15:32.140 --> 15:34.601
We're not moving, ass-faces!

15:34.726 --> 15:36.102
Free blanket?

15:37.604 --> 15:39.481
Though we know
we have differences,

15:39.606 --> 15:41.524
we believe that a compromise
can be reached.

15:41.650 --> 15:44.152
In the meantime, it hurts us
to see you all on television

15:44.277 --> 15:45.320
sitting in the cold.

15:45.445 --> 15:48.448
Will you not take this offering
as a gesture of goodwill?

15:50.367 --> 15:53.244
You had me at "free blanket."

15:55.956 --> 15:58.375
Free blanket?
Free blanket?

15:58.500 --> 15:59.626
Blanket?

15:59.751 --> 16:01.711
Tom, it now looks
as if the Native Americans

16:01.836 --> 16:04.172
are handing out blankets
as a sign of goodwill

16:04.297 --> 16:05.715
towards the South Park people.

16:05.840 --> 16:07.717
What an incredible display
of compassion.

16:07.842 --> 16:10.971
I certainly hope there's
nothing sinister behind it.

16:11.096 --> 16:13.473
Please, as a token
of good faith.

16:13.598 --> 16:16.768
You understand if I'm
a little wary of trusting you.

16:16.893 --> 16:19.354
It is only a blanket, Mr. Marsh.

16:19.479 --> 16:21.314
Well, thanks.

16:22.482 --> 16:24.818
Oh.
You're welcome.

16:27.654 --> 16:29.322
Tom, it's Tuesday morning now,

16:29.447 --> 16:31.324
and the outbreak of SARS
in South Park

16:31.449 --> 16:32.867
has reached epic proportions.

16:34.160 --> 16:35.829
The entire town
has been quarantined

16:35.954 --> 16:38.331
by the federal government,
nobody allowed in or out,

16:38.456 --> 16:40.875
which means nobody can come
to our aid.

16:42.002 --> 16:46.131
It appears this town
and this reporter are done for.

16:46.256 --> 16:48.633
Coming up next -- choosing
the right hair conditioner.

16:48.758 --> 16:50.301
What you don't know
about hair-care products

16:50.427 --> 16:52.512
could be costing you a bundle.

16:55.807 --> 16:56.850
It's all right, Dad.

16:56.975 --> 16:58.560
How's your...mother?

16:58.685 --> 17:01.479
She's hanging in there.
Here. Drink some beer.

17:04.399 --> 17:05.817
It's cool on my tongue.

17:05.942 --> 17:07.152
You're gonna be all right.

17:07.277 --> 17:10.739
Stanley, listen to me.
I have SARS.

17:10.864 --> 17:14.409
There's only a 98% chance
that I will live.

17:14.534 --> 17:15.493
No, Dad!
No!

17:15.618 --> 17:16.828
Listen, Stan!

17:16.953 --> 17:19.205
SARS is destroying our people.

17:19.330 --> 17:21.541
The Native Americans put it
in the blankets they gave us.

17:22.751 --> 17:25.211
Soon there will be
only 98% of us left.

17:26.337 --> 17:27.881
What can I do?

17:28.006 --> 17:31.426
You...must find a cure
for SARS, son,

17:31.551 --> 17:33.053
and save our people.

17:33.178 --> 17:35.305
Cure SARS?
Aw, Jesus!

17:35.430 --> 17:38.641
The spirit of middle-class white
people is strong in you, Stan.

17:38.767 --> 17:41.895
Seek out the wise man
in Bellocreek.

17:42.020 --> 17:43.897
Now, go!
Go!

17:55.533 --> 17:56.618
What?

17:56.743 --> 17:58.745
Hey, my name's Stan,
and I was --

17:58.870 --> 18:00.622
Your coming was foretold to me.

18:00.747 --> 18:02.499
You've come to save our people.

18:02.624 --> 18:03.541
Come in.

18:03.666 --> 18:04.793
Watch the cats.

18:04.918 --> 18:07.212
Uh, so, do you know
how to cure SARS?

18:07.337 --> 18:11.049
Me?
No. I am just a guide.

18:11.174 --> 18:12.050
Sit down.

18:12.175 --> 18:14.385
You must find the answer
yourself

18:14.511 --> 18:16.304
by taking an inward journey.

18:16.429 --> 18:18.515
An inward journey?
That sounds kind of gay.

18:18.640 --> 18:22.685
Let the voices of our ancestors
show you the way.

18:22.811 --> 18:25.980
Breathe.
Breathe from the bag of visions.

18:29.442 --> 18:32.695
Ugh!
Oh, dude!

18:34.864 --> 18:37.283
How much longer must we wait
for our superhighway?

18:37.408 --> 18:39.577
SARS has spread throughout
the entire town of South Park,

18:39.702 --> 18:40.703
Chief Runs With Premise.

18:40.829 --> 18:42.330
Their wills will break soon.

18:42.455 --> 18:44.207
Then I suppose
we must be patient.

18:44.332 --> 18:46.376
Runs With Premise,
come quickly!

18:46.501 --> 18:47.585
What is the matter, wife?

18:47.710 --> 18:49.671
It is our son,
Premise Running Thin.

18:49.796 --> 18:50.922
He is very sick!

18:54.259 --> 18:56.344
Premise Running Thin,
what is the matter?

18:56.469 --> 18:59.264
He -- He shared a glass with
one of the people from China.

18:59.389 --> 19:00.682
He has SARS.

19:00.807 --> 19:03.226
No!
I told you not to touch them!

19:03.351 --> 19:05.270
Papa.
Papa.

19:05.395 --> 19:07.981
I have given him herbs
from the desert plant

19:08.106 --> 19:10.275
and water from the cactus
of life,

19:10.400 --> 19:13.027
but nothing seems to be working.

19:13.653 --> 19:14.863
This would not have happened

19:14.988 --> 19:17.157
if those townspeople
would have just moved away!

19:17.282 --> 19:18.324
No more waiting around.

19:18.449 --> 19:20.660
Tomorrow we begin
the final stage of our plan --

19:20.785 --> 19:22.787
shock and awe!

19:28.543 --> 19:29.586
Dad! Dad!

19:29.711 --> 19:30.795
Stanley!

19:30.920 --> 19:33.339
Did you have an inward journey
with the old man?

19:33.464 --> 19:34.549
Did you have a vision?

19:34.674 --> 19:36.718
I don't know if I did or not.
I-I saw something.

19:36.843 --> 19:37.719
Someone spoke to me

19:37.844 --> 19:40.680
and told me the middle-class
white way to cure SARS --

19:40.805 --> 19:43.266
Campbell's chicken noodle soup,
DayQuil, and Sprite.

19:43.391 --> 19:45.435
Yes.
Yes. Of course.

19:45.560 --> 19:47.729
Quickly, Stan!
We must give it to everyone.

19:55.945 --> 19:57.322
Boy, that really did the trick,
Stan.

19:57.447 --> 19:59.490
I thought we were kind of
sort of not really done for!

19:59.616 --> 20:01.784
Thanks to you,
we're all safe now, Stan.

20:01.910 --> 20:03.912
Aah!

20:07.040 --> 20:09.751
Now I will blow your weak,
SARS-infested bodies

20:09.876 --> 20:10.877
off the earth!

20:14.088 --> 20:15.215
What the...

20:15.340 --> 20:19.344
Wait a minute.
Stop! Stop!

20:19.469 --> 20:23.598
Your -- Your SARS --
Where did it go?

20:24.182 --> 20:25.391
We have cured ourselves

20:25.516 --> 20:28.394
using the medicines
of our culture.

20:29.187 --> 20:32.857
My son, Premise Running Thin,
has the SARS as well.

20:32.982 --> 20:35.526
You -- You can cure him?

20:41.783 --> 20:42.784
It is amazing.

20:42.909 --> 20:45.328
All our plants and herbs
failed to heal him.

20:45.453 --> 20:46.746
But your people's remedy

20:46.871 --> 20:49.624
brings the spirit of the buffalo
back into his heart.

20:49.749 --> 20:53.127
Perhaps there are many things we
can learn from your way of life.

20:53.253 --> 20:54.295
We're a simple people.

20:54.420 --> 20:56.756
All we want is to be allowed
to live our lives.

20:56.881 --> 20:58.591
You have cured
Premise Running Thin.

20:58.716 --> 21:03.471
In return, I shall give you all
$5 credit at the casino.

21:04.347 --> 21:05.640
All right.
All right.

21:05.765 --> 21:07.767
I will not build a superhighway
through your town,

21:07.892 --> 21:09.686
and you can
all have your homes back.

21:09.811 --> 21:11.229
All right!
- Yeah!

21:11.354 --> 21:12.146
Whoo-hoo!

21:12.272 --> 21:13.439
Well, I guess we all learned

21:13.564 --> 21:15.483
that South Park
is more than just a town.

21:15.608 --> 21:18.111
It's a community
that nobody can split up.

21:20.989 --> 21:23.533
Dude, who the hell <i>are</i> you?

21:23.658 --> 21:25.243
Alex.

21:25.368 --> 21:26.995
Alex Glick?

21:27.120 --> 21:29.831
I got to come on
and do the guest-voice thingy.

21:29.956 --> 21:32.208
What?!
Get the hell out of here!

21:32.333 --> 21:34.252
Hi, Mom! Hi, Dad!
Hi, Jill!
