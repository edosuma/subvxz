WEBVTT

00:01.479 --> 00:03.090
THAT IS AN EXCELLENT
QUESTION.

00:03.090 --> 00:04.830
AS YOU KNOW,
MATISSE STUDIED
WITH MOREAU,

00:04.830 --> 00:06.615
SO IT'S NO SURPRISE
THAT THEIR WORKS

00:06.615 --> 00:08.791
SHOW THE SAME DISDAIN
FOR PICTORIAL REALISM.

00:08.791 --> 00:11.315
IT'S COOL THAT I HAVE,
LIKE, NO IDEA

00:11.315 --> 00:12.925
WHAT YOU'RE
TALKING ABOUT?

00:12.925 --> 00:15.189
NOT A PROBLEM.
WHERE IS MY BROWN VEST?

00:15.189 --> 00:17.495
OH, IT'S AT THE CLEANERS.
I NEEDED THAT.

00:18.583 --> 00:19.671
HEY.

00:19.671 --> 00:21.804
OH. THANK YOU.

00:21.804 --> 00:24.024
ASK ME ANOTHER ONE.

00:24.024 --> 00:27.244
OK. YOU KNOW,
THIS MUSEUM'S NOT LIKE

00:27.244 --> 00:28.637
THEY'RE PAYING YOU
OR ANYTHING.

00:28.637 --> 00:30.291
WHY ARE YOU GETTING
SO FREAKED OUT?

00:30.291 --> 00:32.467
ART QUESTION.
ASK ME AN ART QUESTION.

00:32.467 --> 00:35.687
OK, OK.

00:35.687 --> 00:38.821
"WHY WAS
GEORGE'S BRAKE--"

00:38.821 --> 00:40.083
GEORGES BRAQUE.

00:40.083 --> 00:43.391
WHATEVER.
WHY WAS THIS GUY

00:43.391 --> 00:46.002
MAINLY REMEMBERED
FOR HIS CUBIST WORKS

00:46.002 --> 00:48.657
WHEN HE ADDED AS MUCH
TO HIS EARLIER PERIODS?

00:48.657 --> 00:50.789
WELL, BECAUSE BRAQUE'S
FAUVIST WORK,

00:50.789 --> 00:52.530
WHICH I GOT TO SEE IN PARIS,

00:52.530 --> 00:54.532
AND IT WAS SO GREAT.
SO I CAN ACTUALLY--

00:54.532 --> 00:56.012
I CAN ACTUALLY USE
THAT EXPERIENCE.

00:56.012 --> 00:58.406
IT WAS ALL ABOUT SAYING
TO THE ART WORLD--

00:58.406 --> 01:00.712
THESE COLORS DON'T WORK.

01:00.712 --> 01:02.714
SOUNDS GOOD TO ME.

01:02.714 --> 01:05.282
NO, GRIFFIN,
THESE COLORS.

01:05.282 --> 01:06.762
I MEAN, THE JOB
IS AT A MUSEUM,

01:06.762 --> 01:08.546
BUT IT'S
THE MODERN ART SECTION.

01:08.546 --> 01:10.461
AND LOOK AT ME.
I'M RESPONSIBLE,
I'M TASTEFUL,

01:10.461 --> 01:11.549
BUT I'M WAY TOO MUTED.

01:13.856 --> 01:14.900
DOES THIS HELP?

01:14.900 --> 01:17.860
THIS--THIS IS PERFECT,

01:17.860 --> 01:18.817
EXCEPT THE SHOES
THAT MATCH IT

01:18.817 --> 01:20.471
ARE AT THE HOUSE,

01:20.471 --> 01:21.472
AND MY TRYOUT
IS IN AN HOUR AND...

01:21.472 --> 01:22.691
I'LL DRIVE YOU.

01:22.691 --> 01:23.779
I'LL QUIZ YOU
ON THE WAY.

01:23.779 --> 01:24.954
WHAT ABOUT THE SHOP?

01:24.954 --> 01:26.216
I'LL OPEN
A LITTLE LATER.

01:26.216 --> 01:27.826
YOU WOULD DO THAT?

01:27.826 --> 01:29.741
WELL, YEAH.

01:32.570 --> 01:34.006
I LOVE YOU SO MUCH.

01:44.713 --> 01:47.455
NOBODY IN THIS HOUSE
CATCHES HALF THE STUFF
YOU CAN RECYCLE.

01:47.455 --> 01:50.501
AND BESIDES,
WHEN I DO THIS,

01:50.501 --> 01:52.634
I DON'T HAVE TO THINK
ABOUT GOING TO PRISON,

01:52.634 --> 01:55.027
WHICH IS FUNNY
WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT

01:55.027 --> 01:56.812
BECAUSE IF I DO
GO TO PRISON,

01:56.812 --> 01:58.292
I'LL PROBABLY DREAM
OF THE DAYS

01:58.292 --> 01:59.554
WHEN I HAD THE FREEDOM
TO RECYCLE.

02:01.556 --> 02:03.427
THAT'S A JOKE, SARAH.

02:05.429 --> 02:06.691
IT'S A SUBPOENA.

02:08.606 --> 02:10.565
LAST NIGHT I WAS
SITTING IN MY ROOM

02:10.565 --> 02:12.393
GOING THROUGH
A COURSE CATALOG
OR SOMETHING,

02:12.393 --> 02:14.221
AND MY MOM
KNOCKS ON THE DOOR.

02:14.221 --> 02:15.613
NOTHING UNUSUAL,
RIGHT?

02:15.613 --> 02:19.095
I SAY COME IN,
SO SHE OPENS THE DOOR,

02:19.095 --> 02:22.272
AND THEN SHE LETS
THIS GUY WALK IN.

02:22.272 --> 02:24.796
AND HE COMES OVER
TO THE BED,
AND HE HANDS ME THIS.

02:24.796 --> 02:27.886
YEAH, I GOT MINE, TOO.

02:27.886 --> 02:30.150
WAIT. YOU KNEW I WAS
GOING TO GET ONE?

02:30.150 --> 02:33.196
THAT'S HOW IT WORKS,
SARAH.

02:33.196 --> 02:34.937
BUT IT'S LIKE
A TOTAL NIGHTMARE.

02:34.937 --> 02:36.417
AND THEN DID YOU
READ THIS?

02:36.417 --> 02:37.809
DID YOU READ THIS?

02:37.809 --> 02:39.637
I MEAN, EVERYTHING
IN HERE IS, LIKE--

02:39.637 --> 02:41.335
LIKE,
"FAILURE TO APPEAR

02:41.335 --> 02:43.380
COULD RESULT
IN A WARRANT
FOR YOUR ARREST."

02:43.380 --> 02:45.513
WHAT DID YOU EXPECT,
SARAH?

02:45.513 --> 02:47.993
I'M ON TRIAL HERE,
AND YOU'RE, LIKE,
THEIR STAR WITNESS.

02:47.993 --> 02:49.821
YEAH, BUT THAT MEANS--

02:49.821 --> 02:51.258
THAT MEANS THAT I'M GOING
TO HAVE TO GET UP THERE

02:51.258 --> 02:53.173
IN FRONT OF EVERYONE,

02:53.173 --> 02:54.652
AND SOME LAWYER'S
GOING TO ASK ME
ALL THESE QUESTIONS.

02:54.652 --> 02:55.740
WELL, SO THEN
SO YOU ANSWER THEM.

02:55.740 --> 02:57.089
YES OR NO.

02:57.089 --> 02:58.830
BUT I KNOW EVERYTHING,
BAILEY.

02:58.830 --> 03:01.442
I KNOW EVERYTHING
THAT THEY NEED
TO CONVICT YOU.

03:01.442 --> 03:04.880
I REMEMBER
HOW YOU WERE
KNOCKING INTO THINGS,

03:04.880 --> 03:07.404
HOW YOU SMELLED,
HOW YOU RAN THAT LIGHT

03:07.404 --> 03:09.014
AND ALMOST...

03:09.014 --> 03:11.234
I MEAN, I BEGGED
YOU NOT TO GET IN
THE CAR.

03:11.234 --> 03:12.757
I KNOW THAT, SARAH.

03:12.757 --> 03:14.194
AND THEY'RE GOING
TO MAKE ME SAY THAT.

03:14.194 --> 03:16.718
THEY'RE GOING
TO DRAG OUT EVERYTHING.

03:16.718 --> 03:20.287
SO IT'S, LIKE,
WHATEVER HAPPENS TO YOU,

03:20.287 --> 03:22.202
YOU KNOW,
IF YOU HAVE TO--

03:22.202 --> 03:24.987
IF YOU HAVE TO GO
TO JAIL,

03:24.987 --> 03:25.988
I'M GOING TO BE THE ONE
THAT PUT YOU THERE.

03:28.512 --> 03:30.166
IT'S GOING TO BE ME,
BAILEY.

03:30.166 --> 03:31.559
ME.

OWEN, OWEN, JUST PUT--
PUT THE FISH DOWN.

04:11.381 --> 04:12.991
OK, JUST PUT THE--

04:12.991 --> 04:14.515
GO GET ON THE OTHER SIDE
AND BOX HIM IN.

04:14.515 --> 04:15.603
Julia:
ANYBODY HOME?

04:15.603 --> 04:17.257
IS THAT JULIA?

04:17.257 --> 04:18.997
GO ASK HER IF SHE
CAN PICK UP OWEN
THIS AFTERNOON.

04:18.997 --> 04:20.564
WHICH ONE?
BOX IN OWEN
OR ASK JULIA?

04:20.564 --> 04:22.044
BEFORE SHE DISAPPEARS.
RUN. ASK HER.

04:22.044 --> 04:25.830
OWEN, LISTEN,
JUST BE A GOOD BOY

04:25.830 --> 04:27.832
AND PUT
THE FISH DOWN, OK?

04:27.832 --> 04:29.356
OH, GOD!

04:29.356 --> 04:32.141
OH! IT'S OK,
LITTLE FISHES.

04:32.141 --> 04:33.142
YOU'RE GOING TO BE OK.

04:33.142 --> 04:34.796
Claudia:
I GOT HER.

04:34.796 --> 04:36.493
CAN I GO GET MY BUS NOW?

04:36.493 --> 04:39.279
YEAH. GO.
GOD KNOWS I CAN'T
DRIVE YOU.

04:39.279 --> 04:41.498
WHAT? I AM, LIKE,
SO, SO, SO LATE.

04:41.498 --> 04:44.371
LOOK, BAY AND I HAVE TO MEET
THIS CRIMINAL LAWYER TODAY

04:44.371 --> 04:46.286
AND SOMEBODY'S
GOT TO PICK UP OWEN
FROM DAY CARE.

04:46.286 --> 04:48.375
WOW. CHARLIE,
I KIND OF CAN'T.

04:48.375 --> 04:49.941
I MEAN, IF I EVEN GET
THROUGH THIS INTERVIEW,

04:49.941 --> 04:51.291
THERE'S A TRAINING SESSION
ALL AFTERNOON,

04:51.291 --> 04:52.857
AND I MEAN...

04:52.857 --> 04:54.032
WELL, IF YOU'D GIVEN ME
SOME KIND OF WARNING.

04:54.032 --> 04:55.556
IF I HAD
SOME KIND OF WARNING,

04:55.556 --> 04:56.948
I WOULDN'T NEED YOU.

04:56.948 --> 04:58.820
WAIT A SECOND.

04:58.820 --> 05:01.301
I DIDN'T FLAKE ON YOU.
HOW CAN YOU BE MAD AT ME?

05:01.301 --> 05:02.476
EASY. WATCH ME.

05:02.476 --> 05:05.130
CHARLIE, THAT IS NOT FAIR.

05:05.130 --> 05:07.176
I MEAN, I WAS AROUND,
AND YOU TOLD ME TO GO.

05:07.176 --> 05:09.874
YOU SAID,
"GO HOME TO YOUR HUSBAND
AND LIVE YOUR LIFE."

05:09.874 --> 05:11.615
OK, FINE.

05:11.615 --> 05:14.052
YOU CAN'T BE MAD AT ME
WHEN I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW.

05:14.052 --> 05:15.880
I SAID FINE, OK?
YOU'RE RIGHT.

05:15.880 --> 05:17.708
OWEN, HE'S MY
RESPONSIBILITY.

05:17.708 --> 05:19.710
I'LL TAKE CARE
OF HIM.

05:19.710 --> 05:21.321
JUST GO DO
YOUR JOB THING.

05:21.321 --> 05:22.322
I HOPE YOU GET IT.

05:22.322 --> 05:24.367
THANK YOU.

05:27.196 --> 05:29.372
NO, NO, NO.
THERE'S NO SUCH THING
AS A LOST CAUSE,

05:29.372 --> 05:31.766
NOT WHEN THE D.A.'s
GOT A HUNDRED CASES
AND I'VE GOT ONE.

05:31.766 --> 05:34.508
WELL, SURE.
SURE, BUT, I MEAN,

05:34.508 --> 05:36.771
I DID IT.BAILEY, EVERYONE DID IT.

05:36.771 --> 05:38.729
I CAN COUNT ON ONE HAND

05:38.729 --> 05:40.078
THE AMOUNT OF CLIENTS
I'VE HAD WHO DIDN'T
DO IT.

05:40.078 --> 05:41.428
THE IDEA IS KNOWING
HOW A JURY WORKS.

05:41.428 --> 05:43.778
NOW, WE GOT A LOT
GOING FOR US.

05:43.778 --> 05:44.779
YOU'RE A LIKABLE
DEFENDANT,

05:44.779 --> 05:46.128
THEY GOT A D.U.I. CASE

05:46.128 --> 05:47.129
WITH NO BLOOD ALCOHOL
LEVEL,

05:47.129 --> 05:48.913
NO FIELD SOBRIETY TEST,

05:48.913 --> 05:50.262
WHICH MEANS THEY'RE GOING
TO RELY ON WITNESSES,

05:50.262 --> 05:51.829
AND WITNESSES
CAN BE DISCREDITED.

05:51.829 --> 05:54.702
OK.
ALL RIGHT.

05:54.702 --> 05:56.486
ALL RIGHT,
NOW, LET'S START
WITH SARAH REEVES.

05:58.227 --> 06:00.490
SHE WAS IN THE CAR
WITH YOU?

06:00.490 --> 06:01.926
I TAKE IT YOU KNOW
THIS PERSON?

06:01.926 --> 06:03.406
YEAH.

06:03.406 --> 06:06.931
SHE, UM,
SHE USED TO BE
MY GIRLFRIEND.

06:06.931 --> 06:08.803
USED TO BE.
WHAT HAPPENED?

06:08.803 --> 06:10.065
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

06:10.065 --> 06:11.371
WHAT DOES THAT
HAVE TO DO--

06:11.371 --> 06:12.459
THEY BROKE UP
WHEN HE CHEATED ON HER.

06:12.459 --> 06:14.330
HEY, DO YOU MIND?WHAT?

06:14.330 --> 06:15.549
IT'S NONE OF HIS BUSINESS.

06:15.549 --> 06:16.593
OK, NOW, LET'S LOOK
AT THIS.

06:16.593 --> 06:17.681
YOU BROKE UP
WITH HER?

06:17.681 --> 06:19.640
I THINK
WE CAN MAKE A CASE

06:19.640 --> 06:21.293
WHERE SHE GOT JEALOUS,

06:21.293 --> 06:22.686
SHE MADE UP THIS DRINKING
AND DRIVING STORY

06:22.686 --> 06:24.253
TO GET BACK AT YOU.

06:24.253 --> 06:25.907
YEAH, BUT THAT'S NOT--

06:25.907 --> 06:28.431
I MEAN, YOU'RE NOT
GOING TO SAY THAT IN COURT.

06:28.431 --> 06:29.432
I'M NOT GOING
TO SAY IT.

06:29.432 --> 06:30.781
SHE WILL.

06:30.781 --> 06:33.523
WAIT. WAIT. NO.
YOU CAN'T DO THAT.

06:33.523 --> 06:36.831
SARAH'S, SHE'S MY FRIEND,

06:36.831 --> 06:39.137
AND SHE DOESN'T EVEN
WANT TO TESTIFY
TO BEGIN WITH, SO...

06:39.137 --> 06:41.313
NOBODY'S THERE
BECAUSE THEY WANT TO BE.

06:41.313 --> 06:42.967
I DON'T CARE.
I DON'T WANT YOU
HURTING HER.

06:42.967 --> 06:44.882
OK, I DON'T WANT YOU
TO DO THAT.

06:44.882 --> 06:47.276
MR. SALINGER,
YOU PUT YOUR GIRLFRIEND
THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD,

06:47.276 --> 06:49.060
NOT ME.

06:49.060 --> 06:50.061
NOW, IF YOU WANT
TO GO TO JAIL FOR THAT,
FINE.

06:50.061 --> 06:51.933
DON'T HIRE ME.

06:51.933 --> 06:53.543
BUT IF YOU WANT
TO WIN THIS THING,

06:53.543 --> 06:54.805
IF YOU WANT
TO GET OUT OF THIS

06:54.805 --> 06:56.416
WITHOUT A FELONY
ON YOUR RECORD,

06:56.416 --> 06:58.069
YOU GOT TO LET ME
DO MY JOB.

06:58.069 --> 06:58.983
OK?

07:00.594 --> 07:01.595
OK.

07:01.595 --> 07:03.031
IT'S OK.

07:03.031 --> 07:04.075
RIGHT, BAY?

07:24.835 --> 07:25.836
OH, UM...

07:25.836 --> 07:28.230
AHEM. HELLO.

07:28.230 --> 07:30.014
REED.

07:30.014 --> 07:32.103
YEAH?

07:32.103 --> 07:37.413
I FORGOT MY DARN--DAMN!
DAMN COMBINATION.

07:37.413 --> 07:39.850
I WAS JUST WONDERING...

07:39.850 --> 07:41.243
WELL, DO YOU THINK
YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO...

07:41.243 --> 07:43.985
YEAH, I MIGHT STILL
REMEMBER IT.

07:43.985 --> 07:45.508
HEY, GOOD IDEA.

07:47.945 --> 07:50.557
I'M, LIKE, NO GOOD
AT NUMBERS AT ALL.

07:52.080 --> 07:53.951
DON'T YOU HATE MATH?

07:53.951 --> 07:56.040
ENGLISH, TOO.

07:56.040 --> 07:58.173
DON'T YOU HATE EVERYTHING?

07:58.173 --> 07:59.957
I DON'T KNOW.

07:59.957 --> 08:03.352
YOU'RE RIGHT.
YOU'RE RIGHT, YOU'RE RIGHT.

08:03.352 --> 08:05.136
I MEAN, THERE'S LOTS
OF STUFF I LIKE,

08:05.136 --> 08:08.096
LIKE, UM...UM,
WHAT DO YOU LIKE?

08:08.096 --> 08:10.054
I GOT TO GO.

08:10.054 --> 08:12.317
GUESS I'LL BE BUMPING
INTO YOU, RIGHT?

08:12.317 --> 08:14.668
YEAH. YEAH,
YOU'RE DEFINITELY...

08:15.930 --> 08:16.844
GONNA...

08:18.541 --> 08:19.890
BUMP INTO ME.

08:24.939 --> 08:27.115
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,

08:27.115 --> 08:28.943
IF YOU WILL DIRECT
YOUR ATTENTION
TO YOURS TRULY,

08:28.943 --> 08:30.858
YOU WILL SEE
AN EXCELLENT EXAMPLE

08:30.858 --> 08:32.990
OF A LATE 20th CENTURY
MUSEUM DOCENT.

08:32.990 --> 08:34.339
YOU GOT IT?YES!

08:34.339 --> 08:36.298
YEAH, YOU GOT IT! YEAH!
JUL, YOU RULE!

08:36.298 --> 08:38.474
HEY, I'VE GOT A SURPRISE
FOR YOU, TOO.

08:38.474 --> 08:40.345
SINCE YOU'VE NEVER SEEN
THE INSIDE OF A MUSEUM,

08:40.345 --> 08:42.434
I BET YOU'VE NEVER
GOTTEN FRISKY WITH
A DOCENT BEFORE.

08:42.434 --> 08:44.567
THAT'S TRUE, BUT, UH...

08:46.961 --> 08:48.136
Man: IS IT OK
I USED YOUR TOOTHBRUSH?

08:48.136 --> 08:50.138
MY MOUTH TASTE LIKE BILGE.

08:50.138 --> 08:52.706
JULIA,
THIS IS SCHUYLER.

08:52.706 --> 08:53.576
SCHUYLER,
THIS IS JULIA.

08:56.274 --> 08:59.408
HI. HI.
IS THIS ALL HIS STUFF?

08:59.408 --> 09:00.888
REMEMBER I TOLD YOU
ABOUT SCHUYLER?

09:00.888 --> 09:02.063
HE BUNKED WITH ME

09:02.063 --> 09:04.369
ON MY FIRST
KYOTO CROSSING.

09:04.369 --> 09:07.590
YEAH, BUT YOU NEVER TOLD ME
HE HAD SO MUCH STUFF.

09:07.590 --> 09:11.246
HIS SHIP IS DOCKED
AT OAKLAND,

09:11.246 --> 09:12.987
AND HE'S HERE
ON A 4-DAY LAYOVER.

09:12.987 --> 09:14.815
4 DAYS
STAYING WITH US.

09:16.556 --> 09:18.209
WOW.

09:18.209 --> 09:19.210
[RINGS]

10:12.699 --> 10:15.397
D.H. LAWRENCE?

10:15.397 --> 10:16.311
[LOCKER CLOSES]

10:17.442 --> 10:19.836
ARE THESE LITTLE TUGBOATS?

10:19.836 --> 10:25.233
YEAH. SCHUYLER'S A LITTLE
ROMANTIC ABOUT, YOU KNOW,
THE SEA.

10:25.233 --> 10:26.713
YOU CAN SAY IT.

10:26.713 --> 10:29.237
SHE'S MY REASON FOR BEING.

10:30.412 --> 10:34.068
MY EVER FAITHFUL
LADYLOVE.

10:34.068 --> 10:36.374
HMM, LOVE?

10:36.374 --> 10:39.073
THEN I GUESS 4 DAYS
MUST SEEM LIKE
A LONG TIME

10:39.073 --> 10:40.814
TO BE AWAY FROM,
UM, HER.

10:40.814 --> 10:42.293
HEY, THOSE DOGS

10:42.293 --> 10:43.817
MUST BE BARKING
PRETTY BAD
RIGHT NOW, HUH?

10:43.817 --> 10:44.687
WHY DON'T YOU
TAKE A LOAD OFF?

10:46.167 --> 10:47.211
OH.

10:47.211 --> 10:48.299
ALL RIGHT.

10:48.299 --> 10:50.693
YOU SURE?

10:50.693 --> 10:54.001
WELL, I DID DO
3 PRACTICE TOURS
TODAY.

10:54.001 --> 10:57.221
LAY BACK, TELL ME
WHAT YOU WANT FOR DINNER.

10:57.221 --> 11:00.007
I DON'T KNOW.
I CAN'T EVEN THINK.

11:00.007 --> 11:02.313
HOW ABOUT SOME
NICE BROILED SALMON?

11:02.313 --> 11:03.837
SOUNDS LIKE
A LOT OF TROUBLE.

11:03.837 --> 11:06.666
IT'S ALREADY
MARINATING IN THE FRIDGE.

11:08.711 --> 11:09.843
ARE YOU FOR REAL?

11:09.843 --> 11:10.713
YES.

11:11.932 --> 11:13.281
WOW.

11:13.281 --> 11:15.326
I GOT TO TELL YOU

11:15.326 --> 11:17.938
I LOOK AT YOU GUYS,
AND I THINK,

11:17.938 --> 11:20.723
"HOW OFTEN DO YOU GET
TO SEE A GOOD MAN

11:20.723 --> 11:22.420
FIND AN EVEN BETTER WOMAN?"

11:24.031 --> 11:25.902
OH, THANKS.

11:25.902 --> 11:28.035
YEAH, I JUST WISH I KNEW
WHICH WAS WHICH.

11:30.820 --> 11:33.605
SO HOW WAS DAY CARE TODAY,
BUDDY?

11:33.605 --> 11:35.303
DID YOU HAVE FUN?

11:35.303 --> 11:36.739
I MADE MUD PIES.

11:36.739 --> 11:38.523
TO EAT OR PLAY WITH?

11:38.523 --> 11:40.569
NOT TO EAT.

11:43.311 --> 11:44.312
HI.

11:44.312 --> 11:45.922
CHARLIE, IS IT?

11:45.922 --> 11:49.447
YEAH.
AND YOU'RE, UH,
HEDDY'S MOM.

11:49.447 --> 11:51.319
YEAH. I'M SALLY.
UH...

11:51.319 --> 11:52.668
DID MARTIN CALL YOU?

11:52.668 --> 11:53.669
MARTIN?

11:53.669 --> 11:55.149
JASON'S DAD?

11:55.149 --> 11:56.846
DIDN'T HE TELL YOU
ABOUT THE MEETING?

11:56.846 --> 11:58.805
THE MEETING? NO.

11:58.805 --> 11:59.936
LOOK,
MAYBE YOU BETTER
CLOSE THE DOOR.

12:07.814 --> 12:10.904
LOOK, I DON'T KNOW
HOW TO SAY THIS,

12:10.904 --> 12:12.732
SO I'M JUST GOING TO...

12:12.732 --> 12:14.821
JASON CAME HOME
FROM DAY CARE LAST TUESDAY,

12:14.821 --> 12:15.996
AND HE WAS UPSET.

12:15.996 --> 12:18.215
MARTIN HAD A LOOK AT HIM,

12:18.215 --> 12:20.609
AND THE BOY HAD THIS--

12:20.609 --> 12:24.831
HE HAD THESE BRUISES
ON HIS ARM AND HIS SHOULDER.

12:24.831 --> 12:26.180
BRUISES?

12:26.180 --> 12:28.269
WHEN MARTIN ASKED HIM
HOW HE GOT HURT,

12:28.269 --> 12:29.879
JASON DIDN'T WANT
TO TALK ABOUT IT.

12:29.879 --> 12:31.359
HE SAID HE DIDN'T WANT
TO GET INTO TROUBLE.

12:31.359 --> 12:33.100
I DON'T GET IT.

12:33.100 --> 12:36.886
THE NEXT MORNING
HE WAS SCARED
TO GO TO DAY CARE.

12:36.886 --> 12:38.932
HE SAID JENNY
WAS MAD AT HIM,

12:38.932 --> 12:40.020
AND HE DIDN'T WANT
TO SEE HER.

12:40.020 --> 12:41.456
WOW. THAT'S...

12:41.456 --> 12:43.719
PLUS KEVIN NEIGHER
KEEPS TELLING LINDA

12:43.719 --> 12:45.547
THAT HE DOESN'T WANT
TO GO TO DAY CARE.

12:45.547 --> 12:47.114
KEVIN,
HE'S THE REDHEAD?

12:47.114 --> 12:48.985
I'M TRYING TO TELL YOU

12:48.985 --> 12:51.118
THAT THIS IS WHAT
THEY LOOK FOR.

12:51.118 --> 12:53.947
THIS IS HOW THEY KNOW
SOMETHING'S WRONG

12:53.947 --> 12:56.036
AT ONE OF THESE PLACES.HEY, THERE!

12:56.036 --> 12:59.039
REMEMBER SOCKS
FOR THE PUPPET SHOW
THIS FRIDAY.

12:59.039 --> 13:01.258
CLEAN ONES.

13:04.174 --> 13:05.306
LOOK, I, UH...

13:05.306 --> 13:06.698
I GOT TO GO.

13:15.490 --> 13:17.187
WHAT DOES CALLIE
HAVE TO DO WITH IT?

13:17.187 --> 13:18.710
NOTHING.
SHE HAS NOTHING
TO DO WITH IT.

13:18.710 --> 13:19.973
SO HE'S GOING
TO ASK ME ABOUT ALL THAT,

13:19.973 --> 13:21.452
OUR WHOLE RELATIONSHIP?

13:21.452 --> 13:23.193
HE HAS TO, SARAH.
YOU'RE THE ENEMY,

13:23.193 --> 13:24.542
SO HE HAS TO MAKE YOU
LOOK BAD.

13:24.542 --> 13:26.109
MAN! MAN, THAT IS...

13:26.109 --> 13:27.632
AND I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO DO

13:27.632 --> 13:29.243
BECAUSE HE'S GOING
TO RIP YOU APART.

13:29.243 --> 13:31.158
HE'S GOING TO ASK YOU
ABOUT ALL THIS STUFF,

13:31.158 --> 13:32.768
AND YOU'RE GOING
TO HAVE TO ANSWER
ALL OF HIS QUESTIONS.

13:32.768 --> 13:34.944
NO, I WON'T DO IT.HE'LL MAKE YOU, SARAH.

13:34.944 --> 13:36.511
I SHOULD JUST SAY
I DON'T REMEMBER.

13:36.511 --> 13:37.642
HE'LL JUST KEEP
COMING AFTER YOU.

13:38.818 --> 13:40.776
NO.

13:40.776 --> 13:42.125
BAILEY, I MEAN IT.

13:42.125 --> 13:45.259
WHAT IF--
WHAT IF I SAID THAT?

13:45.259 --> 13:47.261
WHAT IF I SAID,
"I DON'T REMEMBER"?

13:47.261 --> 13:51.047
I DON'T REMEMBER
ANYTHING ABOUT
WHAT HAPPENED.

13:51.047 --> 13:53.006
THINK ABOUT IT.
WHY CAN'T I SAY THAT?

13:54.834 --> 13:56.879
I DON'T KNOW.WHAT CAN THEY DO?

13:56.879 --> 13:58.620
I MEAN, THEY SAY
THEY DON'T BELIEVE ME,

13:58.620 --> 14:00.796
I SAY, "HEY, LET'S BREAK
A WINDSHIELD OVER YOUR HEAD

14:00.796 --> 14:02.015
AND SEE HOW MUCH
YOU REMEMBER."

14:04.539 --> 14:07.847
WHAT?
WHAT, YOU DON'T THINK
IT'LL WORK?

14:07.847 --> 14:10.762
OK, ALL RIGHT,
GO AHEAD. ASK ME.

14:10.762 --> 14:11.851
ASK ME THE QUESTION?

14:14.114 --> 14:15.811
OK.

14:15.811 --> 14:18.422
ON THE NIGHT
OF THE ACCIDENT,

14:18.422 --> 14:20.903
WAS BAILEY SALINGER
UNDER THE INFLUENCE?

14:20.903 --> 14:25.908
UM, YOU KNOW,
IT WAS A REALLY
LONG TIME AGO,

14:25.908 --> 14:28.128
AND I DID HIT MY HEAD
PRETTY HARD,

14:28.128 --> 14:29.869
SO TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH,

14:29.869 --> 14:31.261
THE ONLY THING
THAT I REMEMBER

14:31.261 --> 14:32.741
IS WAKING UP
IN A HOSPITAL

14:32.741 --> 14:34.917
WITH THESE BANDAGES
ON MY HEAD.

14:34.917 --> 14:37.267
AND THAT'S...

14:37.267 --> 14:38.834
YEAH, THAT'S
PRETTY MUCH IT.

14:42.794 --> 14:44.448
SEE?

14:55.155 --> 14:57.157
I WANT TO WARN YOU

14:57.157 --> 14:58.723
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE
TO KNOW ANYTHING
FOR SURE

14:58.723 --> 15:00.508
IN THESE KINDS OF CASES.

15:00.508 --> 15:02.858
KIDS DON'T WANT
TO TALK ABOUT STUFF
LIKE THIS,

15:02.858 --> 15:05.643
AND WHEN THEY DO TALK,
WELL, IT'S HARD TO KNOW
WHAT TO BELIEVE.

15:05.643 --> 15:07.167
NOW, THAT'S
THE BAD NEWS.

15:07.167 --> 15:08.820
THE GOOD NEWS IS

15:08.820 --> 15:10.822
I DON'T SEE ANY SIGNS
THAT OWEN WAS ABUSED.

15:10.822 --> 15:13.042
I MEAN, PHYSICALLY,
THERE'S NOTHING.

15:13.042 --> 15:15.697
AND EMOTIONALLY,
WELL, WE TALKED
FOR A WHILE

15:15.697 --> 15:17.003
AND PLAYED A FEW GAMES.

15:17.003 --> 15:18.743
THERE'S NOTHING.
NO APATHY,

15:18.743 --> 15:20.876
NO DEPRESSION,
NO HOSTILITY.

15:20.876 --> 15:22.660
GREAT. THAT'S GREAT.

15:22.660 --> 15:24.401
AND ANOTHER GOOD SIGN.

15:24.401 --> 15:26.316
I ASKED HIM ABOUT
THIS TEACHER SPECIFICALLY.

15:26.316 --> 15:28.275
ASKED HIM HOW HE FELT
ABOUT GOING
TO PRESCHOOL,

15:28.275 --> 15:30.538
HOW HE FELT ABOUT HER,

15:30.538 --> 15:31.669
AND HE WAS COMPLETELY
COMFORTABLE

15:31.669 --> 15:33.584
THE WHOLE TIME
WE WERE TALKING.

15:33.584 --> 15:36.457
IN FACT, I COULDN'T
GET HIM TO SHUT UP
ON THE SUBJECT.

15:36.457 --> 15:39.939
SO HE'S OK?
NOTHING HAPPENED?

15:39.939 --> 15:41.853
AS FAR AS I CAN TELL.

15:41.853 --> 15:43.943
WOW.

15:45.118 --> 15:47.555
THANKS.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

15:47.555 --> 15:49.470
SO THAT'S ABSTRACT
EXPRESSIONISM TO YOUR LEFT

15:49.470 --> 15:51.515
AND SOCIAL REALISM
TO YOUR RIGHT.

15:51.515 --> 15:54.301
OR IS THAT MY LEFT
AND MY RIGHT

15:54.301 --> 15:56.433
OR MY LEFT
AND THEIR RIGHT?

15:56.433 --> 15:59.088
WATCH THE IRON.

15:59.088 --> 16:00.698
YOU NEED ME
TO MAKE YOU SOME LUNCH?

16:00.698 --> 16:02.483
NO. I'M GRABBING LUNCH
AT, UM...THE RESTAURANT.

16:02.483 --> 16:04.398
CHARLIE'S CATCHING ME UP
ON ALL THE BAILEY STUFF.

16:04.398 --> 16:06.182
OH! OH! AND TONIGHT
I DREW THE NIGHTTIME
ROTATIONS,

16:06.182 --> 16:08.445
SO I ONLY HAVE
A LITTLE TIME
FOR DINNER, OK?

16:08.445 --> 16:10.230
HEY, I'M EASY.

16:10.230 --> 16:12.841
UM, SHOPPING LIST
ON THE FRIDGE

16:12.841 --> 16:14.712
AND DON'T FORGET
TO PICK UP MY STUFF
FROM THE CLEANERS.

16:14.712 --> 16:16.758
GOT IT.

16:16.758 --> 16:18.716
HEY, BREAK A STATUE.

16:29.684 --> 16:31.512
[CHUCKLES]

16:32.600 --> 16:33.818
GIVE ME A BREAK.

16:33.818 --> 16:35.429
IT'S HER FIRST DAY AT WORK.

16:35.429 --> 16:37.474
I'M WATCHING
HOW YOU WORK THAT SPONGE,

16:37.474 --> 16:39.650
AND I'M THINKING,

16:39.650 --> 16:40.738
"THIS AIN'T YOUR FIRST DAY."

16:43.567 --> 16:45.526
SO I DO SOME WORK
AROUND HERE. SO WHAT?

16:47.484 --> 16:48.529
REMEMBER ON THE BOAT...

16:50.357 --> 16:52.576
WHEN MR. BRAWLEY
WOULD FIND A LOOSE LINE

16:52.576 --> 16:55.492
OR SOME TARNISH
ON THE BRIGHTWORK?

16:58.147 --> 17:02.021
AND HE WOULD JUST--
HE WOULD JUST STAND THERE

17:02.021 --> 17:05.502
TILL ONE OF US
CAME ALONG AND FIXED IT.

17:05.502 --> 17:07.504
EVER WONDER WHY
HE DIDN'T JUST
FIX IT HIMSELF?

17:07.504 --> 17:10.594
NO. HE WAS THE FIRST MATE.

17:10.594 --> 17:12.596
HE DID IT

17:12.596 --> 17:14.294
BECAUSE IF
EVERYBODY DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT THEIR JOB WAS,

17:14.294 --> 17:16.774
THE BOAT WOULD SINK
THE FIRST SIGN
OF TROUBLE.

17:16.774 --> 17:20.256
LOOK.
I LIKE DOING THINGS
FOR HER, ALL RIGHT?

17:20.256 --> 17:21.866
I LOVE HER.

17:21.866 --> 17:24.173
DOESN'T SHE LOVE YOU?OF COURSE SHE DOES.

17:24.173 --> 17:25.870
SO WHY CAN'T SHE
DO THINGS FOR YOU?

17:25.870 --> 17:27.002
SHE DOES.
SHE DOES PLENTY.

17:27.002 --> 17:30.005
WHAT? WHAT?

17:30.005 --> 17:31.963
LOOK, GRIFF,
IF YOU WANT TO LOVE HER,
HEY, THAT'S GREAT, MAN.

17:31.963 --> 17:35.010
I MEAN, THERE'S
PLENTY THERE TO LOVE.

17:35.010 --> 17:37.839
BUT YOU JUST REMEMBER...

17:37.839 --> 17:40.320
CLEOPATRA,
SHE HAD GUYS
THAT LOVED HER.

17:40.320 --> 17:42.583
THEY WORSHIPPED
THE GROUND
THAT SHE WALKED ON.

17:43.975 --> 17:45.977
THEY HAPPENED TO BE
HER SLAVES.

17:48.589 --> 17:50.504
YOU MEAN IT COULD
END UP BEING MORE?

17:50.504 --> 17:52.201
MORE THAN WHAT,
20,000?

17:52.201 --> 17:53.942
THAT'S WHAT LAWYERS COST.

17:53.942 --> 17:56.118
WOW! REALLY?

17:56.118 --> 17:58.077
I MEAN, IS HE
THE ONLY GUY
OUT THERE?

17:58.077 --> 17:59.426
WE DON'T HAVE TIME
TO SHOP AROUND, JUL.

17:59.426 --> 18:01.515
WE GOT A PRETRIAL HEARING
IN 3 DAYS.

18:01.515 --> 18:04.561
AND PLUS, I MEAN,
THIS GUY IS GOOD.

18:04.561 --> 18:08.304
OK. OK,
WELL, IF THAT'S TRUE,

18:08.304 --> 18:09.871
THEN MAYBE WE CAN HELP,

18:09.871 --> 18:11.699
GRIFFIN AND ME.

18:11.699 --> 18:12.874
I MEAN,
THERE'S STILL MONEY LEFT
IN HIS SETTLEMENT.

18:12.874 --> 18:14.832
A FAIR AMOUNT, I THINK.

18:14.832 --> 18:16.356
THAT'S NICE, JUL,
BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO.

18:16.356 --> 18:18.445
WE'VE GOT ALMOST HALF
OF WHAT WE NEED

18:18.445 --> 18:21.100
IF YOU TAKE EVERYTHING
FROM CHECKING AND SAVINGS.

18:21.100 --> 18:24.712
AND, LOOK,
THERE'S MOM'S PIANO.

18:24.712 --> 18:25.800
NO ONE'S USING IT ANYWAY.

18:27.802 --> 18:29.325
I GUESS, SURE.

18:29.325 --> 18:30.674
THE THING
I DON'T WANT TO DO

18:30.674 --> 18:31.806
IS HAVE TO BORROW
AGAINST THE HOUSE,

18:31.806 --> 18:32.937
BUT, I MEAN,
IF WE HAVE TO...

18:32.937 --> 18:34.025
RIGHT.
ANOTHER MORTGAGE.

18:34.025 --> 18:35.462
THAT MEANS
MORE INTEREST.

18:35.462 --> 18:37.203
BUT OK.

18:37.203 --> 18:39.814
FOCUS, CLAUDIA, FOCUS.

18:39.814 --> 18:41.511
Claudia:
BUT I CAN'T SEE
ANYTHING.

18:41.511 --> 18:43.426
WHAT DO YOU NEED TO SEE?

18:43.426 --> 18:44.862
[WHISTLE BLOWS]

18:44.862 --> 18:47.648
FOCUS.

18:47.648 --> 18:50.129
OK, FINE.
LET'S TAKE A BREAK.

19:04.795 --> 19:05.840
[WHISTLE BLOWS]

19:24.728 --> 19:27.122
KIND OF REMINDS
FROM A SCENE FROM
THE PLUMED SERPENT,

19:27.122 --> 19:29.559
THE ONE
WHERE THEY SACRIFICE
THOSE PEASANTS.

19:29.559 --> 19:33.911
WELL, YOU DO KNOW
THE PLUMED SERPENT,
RIGHT?

19:33.911 --> 19:36.436
BY D.H. LAWRENCE?

19:38.351 --> 19:39.700
WHO'S D.H. LAWRENCE?

19:44.661 --> 19:45.706
WHAT WAS SHE DOING IN THERE?

19:45.706 --> 19:47.098
IS SHE IN TROUBLE NOW?

19:47.098 --> 19:48.752
I DON'T KNOW.
I DON'T KNOW.

19:48.752 --> 19:50.972
YOU WANT TO TELL ME
WHAT THAT WAS ABOUT?

19:50.972 --> 19:52.843
I WAS JUST ANSWERING
THE QUESTIONS.

19:52.843 --> 19:54.758
YOU TOLD THEM
THAT YOU DON'T
REMEMBER ANYTHING.

19:54.758 --> 19:55.759
MAYBE I DON'T.

19:55.759 --> 19:56.934
YOU LIED ON RECORD

19:56.934 --> 19:58.284
TO AN OFFICER
OF THE COURT.

19:58.284 --> 19:59.894
HOW IS THAT A LIE?

19:59.894 --> 20:01.156
IF I DON'T REMEMBER,
I DON'T REMEMBER.

20:01.156 --> 20:02.636
YOU CHANGED YOUR STORY,
SARAH.

20:02.636 --> 20:03.811
SO WHAT?

20:03.811 --> 20:04.942
WHAT YOU SAID
ON RECORD

20:04.942 --> 20:06.944
CAN BE USED
TO IMPEACH YOU.

20:06.944 --> 20:08.511
IF THEY WANT TO,
THEY CAN CHARGE YOU
WITH PERJURY.

20:08.511 --> 20:09.904
YOU HAVE GOT TO GO
BACK IN THERE

20:09.904 --> 20:11.514
AND TELL THEM
THAT YOU MADE A MISTAKE.

20:11.514 --> 20:12.776
NO. I WON'T DO THAT.

20:12.776 --> 20:14.038
YOU KNOW WHAT
PERJURY MEANS?

20:14.038 --> 20:15.736
YOU CAN GO TO JAIL
FOR THAT, SARAH.

20:15.736 --> 20:17.172
TO JAIL.

20:17.172 --> 20:19.609
IF YOU LIE
TO A JUDGE,

20:19.609 --> 20:24.179
IF YOU--IF YOU
BREAK THE LAW
IN THAT COURTROOM,

20:24.179 --> 20:25.180
I CAN'T HELP YOU.

20:25.180 --> 20:26.747
I CAN'T HELP YOU.

20:40.108 --> 20:42.197
T.V.: THE GOLDEN BEARS
HAVE SOMETHING GOING HERE
WITH ONE OUT IN THE FOURTH.

20:45.113 --> 20:46.767
HEY.

20:46.767 --> 20:48.029
[TELEVISION CONTINUES]

20:50.684 --> 20:51.815
GRIFFIN.

20:51.815 --> 20:54.122
UH, HEY.
HOW'D WORK GO?

20:54.122 --> 20:55.732
OH, IT WAS--

20:55.732 --> 20:57.038
CUT HIM OFF!
CUT HIM OFF!

21:00.171 --> 21:02.696
FINE. WORK WAS FINE.

21:04.741 --> 21:06.526
SO YOU HUNGRY?

21:06.526 --> 21:08.397
I DON'T KNOW.
YOU GOING TO MAKE
SOMETHING?

21:08.397 --> 21:11.357
I WOULD,
BUT THERE'S NO FOOD.

21:11.357 --> 21:12.619
WHAT HAPPENED
TO THE LIST?

21:12.619 --> 21:13.837
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
GOING TO...

21:13.837 --> 21:14.708
I DIDN'T GET AROUND
TO IT.

21:16.797 --> 21:18.799
BUT YOU WENT
TO THE CLEANERS, RIGHT?

21:18.799 --> 21:20.235
PLEASE TELL ME YOU
WENT TO THE CLEANERS.

21:20.235 --> 21:21.628
UH-UH.

21:21.628 --> 21:22.629
GOD!

21:22.629 --> 21:23.630
GRIFFIN.

21:23.630 --> 21:25.806
YEAH?

21:25.806 --> 21:27.721
IF YOU WEREN'T
GOING TO GET AROUND
TO IT,

21:27.721 --> 21:29.288
YOU SHOULD HAVE
SAID SO

21:29.288 --> 21:30.724
'CAUSE I WOULD HAVE
BEEN HAPPY TO DO IT.

21:30.724 --> 21:32.726
I THOUGHT I TOLD YOU
I ONLY HAD A FEW MINUTES

21:32.726 --> 21:33.988
FOR DINNER.

21:33.988 --> 21:34.989
I WAS DOING
SOME OTHER STUFF.

21:34.989 --> 21:36.164
IS THAT A PROBLEM?

21:36.164 --> 21:38.253
WELL, YEAH,
IT IS, ACTUALLY.

21:38.253 --> 21:39.341
I'VE ONLY GOT
A FEW THINGS

21:39.341 --> 21:41.212
THAT I CAN WEAR
TO THIS JOB,

21:41.212 --> 21:42.388
AND THE OTHER OUTFIT
THAT I HAVE IS AT THE CLEANERS.

21:42.388 --> 21:44.041
SO IT'S MY JOB
TO MAKE SURE

21:44.041 --> 21:45.782
EVERYTHING AROUND HERE
GETS DONE THE WAY YOU WANT?

21:45.782 --> 21:49.525
NO. YOU JUST SAID
THAT YOU WERE
GOING TO DO IT.

21:49.525 --> 21:51.658
NO, YOU SAID
I WOULD DO IT.

21:53.747 --> 21:54.922
DON'T LOOK AT ME.

21:58.839 --> 22:00.623
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

22:00.623 --> 22:03.931
I AM HUNGRY,
AND I NEED AN OUTFIT
FOR TOMORROW,

22:03.931 --> 22:05.367
SO I'M GOING TO GO
TO THE HOUSE,

22:05.367 --> 22:07.935
AND I'M GOING TO GET
WHAT I NEED.

22:07.935 --> 22:10.241
OH! DID YOU SEE HIM
RIP THAT PUPPY?

22:10.241 --> 22:11.895
HE NEARLY TORE
THE SEAMS OFF IT!

22:11.895 --> 22:12.766
YOU SEE THAT?

22:14.245 --> 22:16.030
MISSED IT.

22:16.030 --> 22:17.379
ALL I AM SAYING IS

22:17.379 --> 22:18.337
THAT IF THESE KIDS
ARE GETTING HURT,

22:18.337 --> 22:19.642
THEN IT'S NOT ENOUGH

22:19.642 --> 22:21.557
JUST TO TAKE THEM
AWAY FROM HER

22:21.557 --> 22:23.080
BECAUSE THEN SHE GOES
TO ANOTHER TOWN.

22:23.080 --> 22:25.256
AND WHAT'S TO STOP HER
FROM SETTING UP--

22:25.256 --> 22:27.998
WHAT DID THE POLICE SAY?THE POLICE?

22:27.998 --> 22:30.958
THEY SAID THESE CASES
ARE VERY HARD
TO PROSECUTE NOW.

22:30.958 --> 22:32.786
YOU HAVE TO VIDEOTAPE
THE KIDS,

22:32.786 --> 22:34.483
AND YOU CAN'T ASK THEM
TOO MANY QUESTIONS,

22:34.483 --> 22:35.963
OR ELSE IT LOOKS LIKE
YOU'RE LEADING THEM ON.

22:35.963 --> 22:37.530
WAIT A MINUTE.

22:37.530 --> 22:38.705
I'M SORRY,
BUT YOU CALLED THE POLICE?

22:38.705 --> 22:40.097
WHY NOT?

22:40.097 --> 22:42.796
ONCE A THING LIKE THAT
GETS PUBLIC...

22:42.796 --> 22:44.928
IT SHOULD BE PUBLIC.

22:44.928 --> 22:46.365
WELL, THAT'S...
I MEAN, YOU'RE GOING
TO RUIN HER BUSINESS.

22:46.365 --> 22:47.714
SO WHAT?

22:47.714 --> 22:49.846
HER BUSINESS?
PEOPLE NEED TO KNOW.

22:49.846 --> 22:51.892
DID ANY KIDS
EVER BLAME JENNY
DIRECTLY?

22:51.892 --> 22:53.720
JASON'S SCARED
TO GO BACK THERE.

22:53.720 --> 22:55.199
WHY ELSE WOULD HE BE
SCARED TO GO BACK THERE?

22:55.199 --> 22:56.810
I CAN THINK OF
PLENTY OF REASONS.

22:56.810 --> 22:59.029
WERE ANYONE ELSE'S
KIDS HURT?

22:59.029 --> 23:00.944
BECAUSE
MY BROTHER'S FINE.

23:00.944 --> 23:01.902
OUR DOCTOR'S
PRETTY SURE
HE WASN'T TOUCHED.

23:01.902 --> 23:03.512
MINE NEITHER.

23:03.512 --> 23:05.775
YOU WANT TO WAIT
UNTIL IT HAPPENS
TO YOUR KIDS?

23:05.775 --> 23:08.038
I DON'T THINK SO.NOBODY'S SAYING THAT.

23:08.038 --> 23:10.301
THERE'S OTHER
GOOD CHILD CARE
OUT THERE,

23:10.301 --> 23:11.912
I MEAN, IF THAT'S
WHAT ANYONE'S
WORRIED ABOUT.

23:11.912 --> 23:14.001
I AM JUST AS WORRIED
ABOUT MY KID AS YOU ARE.

23:14.001 --> 23:15.655
REALLY, BECAUSE IT DOES
KIND OF SEEM LIKE

23:15.655 --> 23:17.134
YOU'RE MORE WORRIED
ABOUT THIS WOMAN.

23:17.134 --> 23:18.788
I JUST DON'T WANT
TO LOCK SOMEBODY UP

23:18.788 --> 23:19.963
WHEN WE DON'T EVEN KNOW
IF SHE DID ANYTHING.

23:19.963 --> 23:20.964
Woman:
HE'S RIGHT.

23:20.964 --> 23:21.965
NO, HE'S NOT.

23:21.965 --> 23:23.663
WHY IS EVERYONE ACTING

23:23.663 --> 23:25.621
LIKE SHE'S SOME KIND
OF INNOCENT VICTIM?

23:25.621 --> 23:27.318
SHE'S GOT A POLICE RECORD.

23:27.318 --> 23:28.885
A RECORD?
SHE HAS--

23:28.885 --> 23:29.886
NOBODY TOLD YOU?

23:29.886 --> 23:31.018
SHOPLIFTING.

23:31.018 --> 23:33.150
SHE STOLE A $400 DRESS

23:33.150 --> 23:34.935
AND THEN LIED ABOUT IT
TO THE POLICE.

23:34.935 --> 23:36.545
WHEN? WHEN WAS THIS?

23:36.545 --> 23:37.720
1979.

23:39.809 --> 23:41.855
THAT'S, WHAT,
20 YEARS AGO?

23:41.855 --> 23:43.465
20 YEARS AGO
SHE GOT CAUGHT.

23:43.465 --> 23:44.901
EXACTLY.

23:44.901 --> 23:46.947
SO WHO KNOWS
WHAT ELSE SHE'S DONE?

23:46.947 --> 23:49.166
EXCEPT LIE ABOUT IT
EVERY DAY SINCE.

23:52.822 --> 23:54.215
BAILEY?

23:54.215 --> 23:56.391
WHAT IF MY PARENTS
ANSWERED THE DOOR?

23:56.391 --> 23:58.045
I TRIED CALLING,
BUT YOU WOULDN'T
ANSWER.

23:58.045 --> 23:59.916
BAILEY, I DON'T EVEN KNOW
IF THEY'RE ASLEEP.

23:59.916 --> 24:01.744
SARAH--
KEEP YOUR VOICE DOWN.

24:01.744 --> 24:04.660
SARAH, THE PLAN,
EVERYTHING THAT
WE TALKED ABOUT,

24:04.660 --> 24:06.140
IT'S OFF.

24:06.140 --> 24:08.751
I HEARD WHAT
YOUR FATHER SAID TO YOU.

24:08.751 --> 24:10.579
MY FATHER IS JUST
TRYING TO SCARE ME.

24:10.579 --> 24:12.059
NO, HE'S NOT.
YOU KNOW HE'S NOT.

24:12.059 --> 24:13.016
Mrs. Reeves:
SARAH!

24:13.016 --> 24:14.061
YEAH, MOM.

24:14.061 --> 24:16.455
SARAH, LISTEN.

24:16.455 --> 24:18.326
I DON'T WANT YOU
LYING FOR ME, OK?

24:18.326 --> 24:19.675
WHEN THEY ASK YOU
THOSE QUESTIONS--

24:19.675 --> 24:21.155
WE'LL TALK ABOUT IT LATER,
OK?

24:21.155 --> 24:22.635
Mrs. Reeves:
WHAT'S GOING ON?
NOTHING!

24:22.635 --> 24:24.811
GO. OK?
YOU'VE GOT TO GO.

24:35.517 --> 24:38.215
NOW, CHARLIE?
CAN WE READ THIS BOOK?

24:38.215 --> 24:39.782
I SAID ANOTHER MINUTE,
OWEN. PLEASE?

24:39.782 --> 24:42.611
I'M ASKING
WHY DO YOU NEED
TO APPRAISE IT?

24:42.611 --> 24:43.830
THERE'S MORE THAN ENOUGH
EQUITY--

24:43.830 --> 24:45.484
GREAT.

24:45.484 --> 24:46.615
WHO IS THAT?

24:46.615 --> 24:47.921
THE BANK.

24:47.921 --> 24:49.313
I'M READY TO KILL
THIS WOMAN.

24:49.313 --> 24:50.880
SHE'S INSISTING
ON HAVING AN APPRAISAL

24:50.880 --> 24:52.316
WHICH CAN TAKE UP
TO A WEEK TO SCHEDULE.

24:52.316 --> 24:53.317
HANG UP ON HER.

24:53.317 --> 24:54.318
BAY, I CAN'T.

24:54.318 --> 24:56.538
I NEVER GOT HER NAME.

24:56.538 --> 24:58.105
WE DON'T NEED
THE MONEY.

24:58.105 --> 24:59.367
I'M GOING TO CALL
THE LAWYER,

24:59.367 --> 25:00.673
AND I'M GOING
TO TELL HIM

25:00.673 --> 25:01.891
I WANT
TO CHANGE MY PLEA TO GUILTY.

25:01.891 --> 25:03.327
WHAT? WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

25:03.327 --> 25:04.851
I'M GOING TO MAKE
SOME KIND OF DEAL.

25:04.851 --> 25:06.069
AS LONG AS
I DON'T HAVE TO GO TO JAIL.

25:06.069 --> 25:07.506
NOW, CHARLIE, NOW.

25:07.506 --> 25:10.030
ONE MORE MINUTE, OWEN,
ALL RIGHT?

25:11.248 --> 25:13.729
BAY, I...

25:13.729 --> 25:14.948
I DON'T BELIEVE THIS.

25:14.948 --> 25:16.776
WE SPENT HALF
OF YESTERDAY

25:16.776 --> 25:18.081
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT
HOW WE WERE GOING
TO PAY FOR THIS.

25:18.081 --> 25:19.735
YEAH, I KNOW WE DID,

25:19.735 --> 25:21.041
AND IT WAS PRETTY MUCH
THE LONGEST DAY OF MY LIFE.

25:21.041 --> 25:22.216
YEAH, WELL,
THAT'S NO REASON--

25:22.216 --> 25:23.783
LOOK AT ME, CHARLIE.

25:23.783 --> 25:26.350
WHAT AM I DOING?
WHAT AM I DOING
TO EVERYBODY?

25:26.350 --> 25:29.440
SARAH WANTS TO GET UP
AND LIE TO PROTECT ME.

25:29.440 --> 25:31.007
AND THIS FAMILY,

25:31.007 --> 25:33.140
WE'RE PRACTICALLY
SELLING OUR HOUSE

25:33.140 --> 25:34.750
TO PAY FOR THIS.

25:34.750 --> 25:36.709
ALL SO SOME
SLIMEBALL LAWYER
CAN GET ME OFF

25:36.709 --> 25:38.319
FOR SOMETHING
THAT I ACTUALLY DID.

25:38.319 --> 25:40.539
IT'S NOT WORTH IT.

25:40.539 --> 25:41.627
CHARLIE, IT'S NOT.

25:41.627 --> 25:43.193
YES, IT IS.
YES, IT IS.

25:43.193 --> 25:44.804
BECAUSE IF YOU MAKE
SOME KIND OF DEAL,

25:44.804 --> 25:45.892
YOU'RE GOING TO END UP
WITH A RAP SHEET, BAY.

25:45.892 --> 25:47.546
BUT I DID IT.

25:47.546 --> 25:49.286
IT'LL FOLLOW YOU AROUND
FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE!

25:49.286 --> 25:50.200
I DID IT!

25:51.724 --> 25:53.203
I DID IT.

25:58.992 --> 26:00.080
GO AHEAD.

26:00.080 --> 26:01.821
NO. I'LL COME BACK.

26:01.821 --> 26:02.822
GRIFFIN.

26:04.998 --> 26:09.655
WERE YOU WISHING
THAT I WOULD DO
ALL THAT STUFF?

26:09.655 --> 26:13.659
YOU KNOW,
COOKING AND CLEANING
AND EVERYTHING?

26:15.748 --> 26:18.489
'CAUSE I DON'T REMEMBER
YOU SAYING ANYTHING ABOUT IT.

26:19.665 --> 26:20.883
NO.

26:20.883 --> 26:23.277
WELL, DO YOU
WANT ME TO?

26:23.277 --> 26:26.019
MY MOM USED TO DO IT...

26:27.673 --> 26:29.675
WHEN SHE WAS AROUND.

26:29.675 --> 26:32.852
'CAUSE AT MY HOUSE,
DAD ALWAYS DID IT.

26:34.462 --> 26:36.464
MOSTLY 'CAUSE
MOM SUCKED AT IT.

26:36.464 --> 26:38.509
A LITTLE ON PURPOSE,
I THINK.

26:40.381 --> 26:42.688
AND THAT'S PROBABLY WHY
I NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT IT.

26:42.688 --> 26:45.386
YOU KNOW,
'CAUSE I NEVER...

26:46.866 --> 26:48.389
I NEVER SAW HER DO IT.

26:50.826 --> 26:52.872
BUT IF
THAT'S WHAT I SHOULD...

26:54.525 --> 26:57.093
IS THAT WHAT
YOU WISH I WOULD DO?

26:59.139 --> 27:00.183
I DON'T KNOW.

27:01.837 --> 27:03.360
MAYBE I DO.

27:10.324 --> 27:11.673
HEY.

27:11.673 --> 27:13.501
HEY.

27:13.501 --> 27:15.198
REMEMBER WHEN YOU ASKED ME
ABOUT THAT BOOK,

27:15.198 --> 27:16.852
D.H. LAWRENCE AT PRACTICE?

27:16.852 --> 27:18.854
YEAH.

27:18.854 --> 27:20.508
WHY'D YOU DO THAT?

27:20.508 --> 27:21.770
WHY DID YOU ASK ME
ABOUT THAT?

27:23.380 --> 27:24.730
I DON'T KNOW.

27:24.730 --> 27:27.863
THAT--THAT STUFF
ON THE FIELD,

27:27.863 --> 27:30.257
IT JUST REMINDED ME
OF THAT BOOK.

27:30.257 --> 27:32.694
DID YOU GO
IN MY LOCKER?

27:32.694 --> 27:33.869
YOUR LOCKER? ME?

27:33.869 --> 27:34.870
WHY--

27:34.870 --> 27:36.176
JUST STAY OUT OF THERE, OK?

27:45.794 --> 27:48.449
I'M SORRY DINNER
IS TAKING SO LONG.

27:48.449 --> 27:50.625
THEY MADE ME
STAY AT THE MUSEUM

27:50.625 --> 27:52.496
FOR SOME STUPID
SAFETY MEETING.

27:54.455 --> 27:56.457
ARE YOU SURE YOU DON'T
NEED ME TO HELP YOU--

27:56.457 --> 27:58.807
NO. GIVE HER A CHANCE,
ALL RIGHT?

27:58.807 --> 28:00.417
HOW'S SHE
SUPPOSED TO LEARN?

28:00.417 --> 28:01.462
WHY WON'T THIS DAMN THING
SIMMER?

28:01.462 --> 28:02.637
OH, GOD!

28:02.637 --> 28:04.508
HERE. LET ME
GIVE YOU A HAND.

28:04.508 --> 28:06.119
I'M SORRY.

28:06.119 --> 28:08.991
OH, WELL.
ROME WASN'T
BUILT IN A DAY.

28:08.991 --> 28:11.341
I'M SORRY.
WHAT DID YOU SAY?

28:11.341 --> 28:12.473
Griffin: COME ON, JULIA.
HE'S JUST--

28:12.473 --> 28:14.518
NO! YOU KNOW WHY,
GRIFFIN?

28:14.518 --> 28:16.651
BECAUSE THE WAY HE HAS BEEN
MALINGERING AROUND
THE LAST 2 DAYS,

28:16.651 --> 28:19.262
MAKING SEXIST CRACKS
LIKE SOME, SOME...

28:19.262 --> 28:20.655
POPEYE THE SAILOR PIG!

28:20.655 --> 28:23.702
I MEAN, WHY IS HE HERE?
WHY ARE YOU HERE?

28:23.702 --> 28:25.094
JUST BEING THERE
FOR MY BUDDY.

28:25.094 --> 28:27.444
NO. MAKING TROUBLE
IS MORE LIKE IT.

28:27.444 --> 28:29.359
SINCE YOU'VE BEEN HERE,
YOU'VE BEEN WHISPERING
IN MY HUSBAND'S EAR.

28:29.359 --> 28:30.578
MAYBE HE NEEDED
TO HEAR IT.

28:30.578 --> 28:31.971
WHAT IS THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

28:31.971 --> 28:33.363
SOMETIMES GRIFFIN
HAS A LITTLE TROUBLE

28:33.363 --> 28:34.930
STICKING UP FOR HIMSELF.

28:34.930 --> 28:36.540
WHAT DOES MY HUSBAND
HAVE TO STICK UP FOR?

28:36.540 --> 28:38.499
"MY HUSBAND"?
YOU KEEP SAYING
"MY HUSBAND."

28:38.499 --> 28:40.240
GUYS, GUYS.

28:40.240 --> 28:41.676
HE'S LIKE A TOASTER
YOU PICKED UP AT BIG AL'S.

28:41.676 --> 28:43.460
HE IS MY HUSBAND.
COOL IT!

28:45.201 --> 28:47.290
CAN WE MELLOW OUT,
PLEASE?

28:47.290 --> 28:48.727
SCHUYLER!

28:48.727 --> 28:51.599
SCHUYLER? I'M NOT
THE PROBLEM HERE.

28:51.599 --> 28:53.296
PRINCESS HERE'S
THE PROBLEM.

28:53.296 --> 28:55.168
EXCUSE ME.
SHE STARTS IN WITH--

28:55.168 --> 28:56.343
CAN WE STOP?!

28:56.343 --> 28:57.474
PLEASE!

28:59.215 --> 29:01.696
JEEZ!
ALL RIGHT, LOOK.

29:01.696 --> 29:04.307
JULIA AND I HAVE OUR OWN WAY
OF DOING THINGS, ALL RIGHT?

29:04.307 --> 29:05.656
WHICH IS...

29:05.656 --> 29:07.136
WE DON'T KNOW
WHAT IT IS YET,

29:07.136 --> 29:08.921
BUT WE'RE WORKING ON IT!

29:08.921 --> 29:11.662
WE'RE JUST NOT READY
TO SHOW IT TO THE WORLD YET.

29:11.662 --> 29:14.100
NOW, EITHER YOU FIND A WAY

29:14.100 --> 29:16.319
TO KEEP YOUR HELPFUL HINTS
TO YOURSELF,

29:16.319 --> 29:19.453
OR GET BACK ON YOUR BOAT
A DAY EARLY.

29:19.453 --> 29:20.715
ALL RIGHT.

29:20.715 --> 29:22.673
NOW I'M GONNA FINISH DINNER.

29:22.673 --> 29:24.458
YOU TWO MAKE UP.

29:24.458 --> 29:26.286
ALL RIGHT,
CAN WE DO THAT?

29:26.286 --> 29:28.201
TRY SOME DIP.

29:32.379 --> 29:33.728
JENNY.

29:33.728 --> 29:36.339
GOD, NOBODY
TOLD ME YOU WERE--

29:36.339 --> 29:38.733
OWEN WASN'T AT
DAY CARE TODAY.

29:38.733 --> 29:41.388
THAT'S 2 DAYS
I HAVEN'T SEEN HIM,

29:41.388 --> 29:43.390
AND I'M WONDERING
ARE YOU PULLING HIM
OUT OF SCHOOL.

29:43.390 --> 29:46.697
WELL, UH...JUST...

29:46.697 --> 29:48.090
FOR NOW.

29:48.090 --> 29:49.657
CHARLIE, IF YOU
TAKE OWEN AWAY,

29:49.657 --> 29:51.485
THAT MEANS
YOU DON'T TRUST ME,

29:51.485 --> 29:54.053
AND IF YOU SAY
YOU DON'T TRUST ME,
THEN IT MEANS--

29:54.053 --> 29:55.750
JENNY, I'M REALLY SORRY,
BUT I GOTTA GET OUTTA HERE.

29:55.750 --> 29:57.404
WE HAVE TO TALK.
I HAVE TO GO TO COURT.

29:57.404 --> 29:59.754
THIS IS MY LIFE,
ALL RIGHT?

29:59.754 --> 30:03.714
IT'S MY LIFE!
YOU PEOPLE ARE
DESTROYING MY LIFE!

30:03.714 --> 30:05.804
THESE PARENTS...

30:05.804 --> 30:07.936
THEIR CHILDREN GET HURT,

30:07.936 --> 30:10.417
AND THEY DON'T EVEN
COME TO ME AND ASK ME
WHAT'S WRONG.

30:10.417 --> 30:13.289
THEY JUST START
SCREAMING OUT
ABOUT CHILD ABUSE,

30:13.289 --> 30:16.771
AS IF THAT'S SOMETHING
THAT THEY CAN JUST
TAKE BACK LATER

30:16.771 --> 30:18.642
IF THEY DECIDE
THAT THEY'RE WRONG.

30:20.340 --> 30:21.732
SO...

30:21.732 --> 30:23.473
HOW DID IT HAPPEN?

30:23.473 --> 30:25.127
I DON'T KNOW.

30:27.434 --> 30:31.568
BUT HOW AM I
SUPPOSED TO PROVE
THAT I DIDN'T DO IT?

30:31.568 --> 30:34.223
SO NOW I CAN'T PROVE
I DIDN'T DO IT,

30:34.223 --> 30:35.790
THEY CAN'T
PROVE I DID DO IT,

30:35.790 --> 30:38.314
SO THEN THEY DRAG OUT
THIS SHOPLIFTING THING,

30:38.314 --> 30:40.403
SOME STUPID THING I DID
WHEN I WAS A KID,

30:40.403 --> 30:42.536
LIKE THAT'S GONNA PROVE

30:42.536 --> 30:47.323
THAT I'M THIS KIND
OF HORRIBLE PERSON
THAT CAN HURT CHILDREN.

30:47.323 --> 30:50.326
AND THAT'S JUST
NOT FAIR, CHARLIE.

30:50.326 --> 30:52.720
NOTHING THAT I
DID BACK THEN

30:52.720 --> 30:54.069
HAS ANYTHING
TO DO WITH THIS.

30:54.069 --> 30:55.462
IT HAS NOTHING TO DO
WITH YOUR KIDS.

30:55.462 --> 30:56.855
JENNY--

30:56.855 --> 30:59.205
YOU GOTTA GO?
YOU GO. FINE. GO.

30:59.205 --> 31:00.815
BUT...

31:00.815 --> 31:03.949
IF YOU WRECK
MY BUSINESS
BECAUSE OF THIS,

31:03.949 --> 31:07.256
IF YOU HIDE OWEN
FROM ME

31:07.256 --> 31:10.303
LIKE I'M SOME KIND
OF MONSTER...

31:12.435 --> 31:13.697
YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED.

31:18.441 --> 31:21.444
PEOPLE VS. BAILEY SALINGER,

31:21.444 --> 31:23.882
CASE NUMBER 48476.

31:23.882 --> 31:26.667
I UNDERSTAND THERE'S BEEN
A PLEA AGREEMENT
REACHED IN THIS CASE.

31:26.667 --> 31:28.495
YES, YOUR HONOR.

31:28.495 --> 31:30.932
IN RETURN
FOR MR. SALINGER'S
PLEA OF GUILTY

31:30.932 --> 31:34.849
TO A COUNT ONE FELONY,
DRIVING UNDER THE INFLUENCE,
WITH INJURIES,

31:34.849 --> 31:37.634
WE HAVE AGREED
TO THE FOLLOWING TERMS:

31:37.634 --> 31:40.376
3 YEARS SUPERVISED
FELONY PROBATION,

31:40.376 --> 31:42.639
WITH 3 YEARS STATE PRISON,
SUSPENDED.

31:42.639 --> 31:44.641
ONE YEAR
SUSPENDED DRIVING LICENSE,

31:44.641 --> 31:48.558
AND 300 HOURS
COMMUNITY SERVICE.

31:48.558 --> 31:49.733
MR. SALINGER.

31:53.041 --> 31:54.869
YOU UNDERSTAND
THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT?

31:54.869 --> 31:56.653
YES, I DO,
YOUR HONOR.

31:56.653 --> 31:58.655
WELL, THAT MAKES ONE OF US.

31:58.655 --> 32:00.483
I THINK THIS IS
A VERY SWEET DEAL

32:00.483 --> 32:03.486
FOR A KID WHO GOT DRUNK
AND ALMOST KILLED SOMEONE.

32:03.486 --> 32:05.488
HOWEVER, GIVEN YOUR RECORD,

32:05.488 --> 32:08.056
I'LL GO ALONG WITH
THE STATE'S RECOMMENDATION,

32:08.056 --> 32:10.711
BUT I WANT YOU TO KNOW,

32:10.711 --> 32:12.234
IF YOU TAKE A DRINK,

32:12.234 --> 32:14.541
IF YOU GET BEHIND
THE WHEEL OF A CAR,

32:14.541 --> 32:16.891
HELL, IF YOU VIOLATE ANY LAW
IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA,

32:16.891 --> 32:19.894
YOU'LL BE IN THIS COURTROOM,
AND I WILL MAKE DAMN SURE

32:19.894 --> 32:21.983
YOU DO THE MAXIMUM TIME
ALLOWABLE.

32:21.983 --> 32:24.507
IS THAT CLEAR ENOUGH,
MR. SALINGER?

32:24.507 --> 32:26.596
YES, IT IS,
YOUR HONOR.

32:28.294 --> 32:29.991
CLEAR OUT, THEN.

32:29.991 --> 32:31.384
NEXT CASE.

32:40.088 --> 32:41.481
HON?

32:41.481 --> 32:43.483
WE'RE HEADING OFF
TO GRAM'S.

32:43.483 --> 32:44.788
SURE YOU DON'T
WANNA COME?

32:44.788 --> 32:46.834
SARAH?

32:46.834 --> 32:49.271
I SAID I'LL GO
SEE HER LATER.

32:49.271 --> 32:51.839
BUT IT'S AN HOUR
TO WOODSIDE,

32:51.839 --> 32:53.449
AND AS LONG AS WE'RE
MAKING THE DRIVE--

32:53.449 --> 32:54.798
NO.

32:54.798 --> 32:58.237
OK? I SAID NO.

32:58.237 --> 33:01.196
SWEETHEART, WE KNOW
THAT YOU'RE MAD AT US.

33:01.196 --> 33:03.329
WE UNDERSTAND THAT.

33:03.329 --> 33:07.855
BUT WE'RE GONNA HAVE
TO MOVE PAST THIS
EVENTUALLY, RIGHT?

33:07.855 --> 33:12.294
I MEAN, WE CAN'T
STAY MAD FOREVER,
CAN WE?

33:12.294 --> 33:15.906
YOU MUST BE SORRY
HE'S NOT IN JAIL.

33:15.906 --> 33:17.996
THAT MUST REALLY BUG YOU.

33:17.996 --> 33:20.911
NO, BUT I'LL
TELL YOU WHAT.

33:20.911 --> 33:22.565
AT LEAST
HE CAN'T DRIVE.

33:22.565 --> 33:24.176
OH, GOD.

33:24.176 --> 33:27.918
WE WOULD DO ANYTHING
TO PROTECT YOU, SARAH.

33:27.918 --> 33:29.181
WHAT IS WRONG WITH THAT?

33:31.835 --> 33:33.228
COME ON.

33:33.228 --> 33:35.013
WE'LL TALK IN THE CAR.

33:35.013 --> 33:38.886
WHY IS IT SO IMPORTANT
FOR ME TO GO WITH YOU GUYS?

33:38.886 --> 33:40.888
WHAT, ARE YOU AFRAID
WHAT I'LL DO
IF I'M HOME ALONE,

33:40.888 --> 33:42.846
AFRAID I'M GONNA
HAVE AN ACCIDENT
DRIVING MYSELF?

33:42.846 --> 33:44.718
WHAT? WHAT DO YOU--

33:44.718 --> 33:46.720
YOU OBVIOUSLY
DON'T TRUST ME
OUT OF YOUR SIGHT.

33:46.720 --> 33:48.852
IT'S BAILEY
THAT WE DON'T TRUST.

33:48.852 --> 33:50.593
WE DON'T TRUST HIM.

33:50.593 --> 33:52.856
NO.

33:52.856 --> 33:54.902
ACTUALLY, IT'S ME.

33:54.902 --> 33:58.253
HONEY,
PEOPLE DON'T CHANGE.

33:58.253 --> 34:00.386
THEY DON'T, OK?

34:00.386 --> 34:03.954
NOW, IT'S VERY SWEET
THAT YOU BELIEVE THAT,
BUT IT'S...

34:03.954 --> 34:04.955
NAIVE?

34:04.955 --> 34:07.088
YEAH. A LITTLE, I THINK

34:09.003 --> 34:12.354
SO YOU GUYS ARE SAYING
THAT THE WAY PEOPLE ARE NOW,

34:12.354 --> 34:13.921
THAT'S THE WAY
THEY'RE ALWAYS GONNA BE.

34:18.012 --> 34:20.971
I'M REALLY SORRY
TO HEAR THAT.

34:26.673 --> 34:28.196
SARAH...

34:28.196 --> 34:29.937
LOOK, WE CAN
TALK ABOUT THIS,
ALL RIGHT?

34:32.287 --> 34:33.897
Mr. Reeves: SARAH.

34:47.302 --> 34:49.826
DID YOU EVER READ
THAT ONE?

34:51.089 --> 34:53.395
YEAH.

34:53.395 --> 34:57.356
YOU KNOW THE PART
WHERE URSULA'S SAYING
SHE HATES THIS ANTON GUY?

34:57.356 --> 35:00.402
WHY DOES SHE STAY WITH HIM
IF SHE HATES HIM SO MUCH?

35:00.402 --> 35:02.448
I MEAN, DOES SHE
REALLY HATE HIM?

35:05.059 --> 35:08.062
WELL, SHE DOESN'T
TOTALLY HATE HIM.
SHE JUST...

35:08.062 --> 35:11.065
SHE JUST HATES
HOW HE WANTS TO FIT IN
SO BAD.

35:11.065 --> 35:14.416
SO IS THAT SUPPOSED TO BE
SAD OR SOMETHING?

35:14.416 --> 35:16.940
OR IS THE GUY
JUST A LOSER?

35:20.030 --> 35:22.946
HEY, SARAH.

35:22.946 --> 35:23.947
ARE YOU OK?

35:25.427 --> 35:28.474
MY PARENTS...

35:28.474 --> 35:32.347
THEY WERE ACTING LIKE
IT WAS ALL FOR THE BEST,

35:32.347 --> 35:36.090
AND I COULDN'T
STAY THERE.

35:37.352 --> 35:40.355
I COULDN'T,
SO I GRABBED...

35:40.355 --> 35:42.879
GRABBED SOME STUFF,
AND I LEFT.

35:45.360 --> 35:46.231
I LEFT.

35:48.972 --> 35:49.886
OH, MAN.

35:51.366 --> 35:52.976
DID THEY ASK--

35:52.976 --> 35:54.413
CAN WE NOT...

35:59.374 --> 36:01.463
IS THERE SOMEPLACE...

36:02.595 --> 36:04.466
YEAH, YEAH. HERE.

36:04.466 --> 36:05.598
THERE'S ROOM.

36:19.481 --> 36:22.484
HOW LONG IS SHE GONNA STAY?

36:22.484 --> 36:24.007
I DON'T KNOW.

36:25.487 --> 36:27.010
IS SHE OK?

36:31.014 --> 36:33.408
ARE YOU OK?

36:33.408 --> 36:36.106
I MEAN, AT LEAST
IT'S OVER, RIGHT?

36:36.106 --> 36:40.459
AT LEAST YOU CAN FINALLY
PUT ALL THIS STUFF
AND JUNK BEHIND YOU.

36:40.459 --> 36:43.418
YEAH, TILL IT
CATCHES UP WITH ME AGAIN.

36:43.418 --> 36:45.246
THE CASE IS CLOSED,
BAILEY.

36:45.246 --> 36:47.466
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO
IS GET THROUGH PROBATION,

36:47.466 --> 36:50.208
AND THEN EVERYTHING WILL BE
BACK TO NORMAL, RIGHT?

36:55.822 --> 36:57.476
RIGHT?

37:00.043 --> 37:02.176
I REMEMBER...

37:02.176 --> 37:04.570
MY SOPHOMORE YEAR
AT GRANT.

37:04.570 --> 37:11.141
THERE WAS THIS KID
WHO TRANSFERRED FROM
SOMEPLACE BACK EAST.

37:11.141 --> 37:13.143
KEITH.

37:13.143 --> 37:15.581
KEITH SOMETHING.

37:15.581 --> 37:19.585
AND, LIKE, 5 MINUTES
AFTER HE GOT THERE,

37:19.585 --> 37:23.545
THE WHOLE SCHOOL KNEW HOW
HE HAD KILLED HIS BROTHER

37:23.545 --> 37:26.244
IN SOME...
A GUN ACCIDENT BACK HOME.

37:26.244 --> 37:30.335
IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE
THIS GIANT SECRET, BUT...

37:30.335 --> 37:34.121
BUT RIGHT AWAY,
EVERYBODY KNEW.

37:34.121 --> 37:37.516
AND WHENEVER ANYBODY
MENTIONED HIS NAME,

37:37.516 --> 37:40.519
IT DIDN'T MATTER
WHAT THEY WERE SAYING,

37:40.519 --> 37:45.393
THAT STORY
WAS THE FIRST THING
THAT POPPED INTO YOUR HEAD.

37:45.393 --> 37:47.177
THAT'S TOTALLY
DIFFERENT, BAILEY.

37:49.092 --> 37:52.095
DID YOU HEAR THAT JUDGE?

37:52.095 --> 37:54.010
HE HATED ME.

37:55.490 --> 37:57.013
HE HATED ME,

37:57.013 --> 37:59.886
AND HE DOESN'T EVEN KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT ME,

37:59.886 --> 38:01.627
EXCEPT FOR THIS
ONE MISTAKE THAT I MADE.

38:01.627 --> 38:06.240
BUT THAT WAS ENOUGH FOR HIM
TO MAKE UP HIS MIND.

38:06.240 --> 38:09.635
IT DOESN'T MATTER
WHAT I DO, CLAUD.

38:09.635 --> 38:13.203
EVERYONE I MEET IS
GONNA SEE ME THAT WAY.

38:13.203 --> 38:16.598
I'M AN ALCOHOLIC WHO MADE
THIS HORRIBLE MISTAKE,

38:16.598 --> 38:19.601
AND THAT IS
GONNA BE WHAT,

38:19.601 --> 38:22.256
WHAT MAKES ME
STAND APART.

38:22.256 --> 38:24.476
THAT'S WHAT'S GONNA
MAKE ME DIFFERENT.

38:26.216 --> 38:27.479
ALWAYS.

38:33.615 --> 38:35.008
CHARLIE.

38:35.008 --> 38:36.575
I'M, UM...

38:36.575 --> 38:39.142
I'M HERE TO PICK UP
OWEN'S STUFF.

38:39.142 --> 38:40.535
YOU MEAN...

38:40.535 --> 38:41.754
I'M SORRY.

38:43.233 --> 38:45.366
YOU'RE TAKING HIM AWAY.

38:47.150 --> 38:48.543
IT JUST...

38:48.543 --> 38:49.675
IT JUST FEELS BAD,
JENNY.

38:52.286 --> 38:54.636
THESE THINGS HAPPENED,
OR THEY DIDN'T--
I DON'T KNOW.

38:54.636 --> 38:58.031
BUT YOU'RE NOT GIVING
ANY EXPLANATIONS
FOR ANYTHING.

38:58.031 --> 39:00.903
AND THEN
THIS OTHER STUFF
COMES UP.

39:00.903 --> 39:02.731
I MEAN...

39:02.731 --> 39:04.124
WHY DIDN'T YOU
SAY ANYTHING?

39:04.124 --> 39:06.256
WHY DID WE HAVE TO
FIND OUT LIKE THIS?

39:06.256 --> 39:08.737
SAY SOMETHING?

39:08.737 --> 39:10.130
LIKE WHAT?

39:10.130 --> 39:12.132
LIKE, "HI, THERE.
I'M JENNY SELBY.

39:12.132 --> 39:15.178
"I WAS CONVICTED
OF SHOPLIFTING
20 YEARS AGO.

39:15.178 --> 39:19.008
WHY DON'T YOU BRING
YOUR KIDS ON OVER
TO MY PRESCHOOL?"

39:21.097 --> 39:22.751
ADMIT IT, CHARLIE.

39:22.751 --> 39:24.536
THIS, UM...

39:24.536 --> 39:27.756
THIS IS NOT
PEOPLE BEING RATIONAL.

39:27.756 --> 39:29.149
THIS IS...

39:29.149 --> 39:31.151
PEOPLE BEING AFRAID.

39:31.151 --> 39:33.762
BECAUSE PUNISHING ME
LIKE THIS,

39:33.762 --> 39:35.547
IT'S JUST NOT FAIR.

39:35.547 --> 39:37.766
IT'S NOT FAIR. IT ISN'T.

39:37.766 --> 39:39.202
I'M NOT SAYING IT IS.

39:39.202 --> 39:40.508
OK, THEN.

39:40.508 --> 39:41.814
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S FAIR.

39:41.814 --> 39:43.772
I HAVE NO IDEA.

39:43.772 --> 39:46.645
AND THE THING IS,
EVEN IF I DID, I...

39:49.778 --> 39:51.432
I'M NOT ANY GOOD
AT THIS, JENNY,

39:51.432 --> 39:52.564
AT BEING A PARENT.

39:52.564 --> 39:54.653
I'M BARELY GETTING BY.

39:54.653 --> 39:56.655
I'VE GOT NO INSTINCTS.

39:59.788 --> 40:01.181
BUT MY LITTLE BROTHER
OWEN,

40:01.181 --> 40:02.661
HE IS
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING

40:02.661 --> 40:04.184
THAT I'VE EVER HAD
TO TAKE CARE OF,

40:04.184 --> 40:05.881
AND I AM NOT TAKING
ANY CHANCES WITH HIM.

40:05.881 --> 40:07.187
NONE.

40:07.187 --> 40:08.841
AND I DON'T CARE
WHO IT HURTS.

40:08.841 --> 40:10.233
YOU, ME,

40:10.233 --> 40:12.845
I WOULD HURT ANYBODY
TO PROTECT HIM

40:12.845 --> 40:17.806
'CAUSE THAT'S
THE ONLY THING
I KNOW HOW TO DO.

40:17.806 --> 40:19.678
SO I'M DOING IT.

40:32.865 --> 40:34.083
OK.

40:34.083 --> 40:36.085
GET SOME SLEEP.

40:36.085 --> 40:36.999
BYE.

40:44.137 --> 40:46.095
YOU GOING OVER THERE?

40:46.095 --> 40:47.749
UH...

40:47.749 --> 40:50.012
NO. HE WANTS TO BE ALONE.

40:52.798 --> 40:55.627
FEEL LIKE MAYBE GETTING
SOMETHING TO EAT?

40:57.106 --> 40:58.760
UH, SURE.

40:58.760 --> 41:00.196
PASTA, MAYBE?

41:00.196 --> 41:01.850
SURE.

41:01.850 --> 41:04.853
YOU WANT ME TO PUT
SOME WATER ON?

41:04.853 --> 41:06.855
BE GREAT.
I'LL START THE SAUCE.

41:06.855 --> 41:09.249
OK. SIMPLE, THOUGH.
WE CAN USED CANNED.

41:09.249 --> 41:11.120
I DON'T MIND CHOPPING.

41:11.120 --> 41:12.687
ALL RIGHT.
YOU DO THE GARLIC,
I'LL DO THE ONIONS?

41:12.687 --> 41:14.080
GARLIC'S SO MUCH EASIER.

41:14.080 --> 41:17.605
YEAH, BUT WATER--
HOW HARD IS THAT?

41:19.738 --> 41:21.479
YOU KNOW WHAT?

41:21.479 --> 41:24.264
I FOUND THIS MENU
UNDER THE DOOR
THIS MORNING,

41:24.264 --> 41:26.875
A NEW CUBAN PLACE
DOWN THE STREET.

41:26.875 --> 41:27.920
SOUNDS GREAT.

41:27.920 --> 41:29.835
I'LL GO GET THE MENU.

41:29.835 --> 41:30.923
I'LL DO THE DIALING.

41:39.192 --> 41:42.717
HEY, DON'T YOU WANNA
TALK TO ME ANYMORE?

41:42.717 --> 41:44.719
I WANNA GO TO SCHOOL.

41:44.719 --> 41:47.809
I KNOW THAT...

41:47.809 --> 41:49.681
BUT YOU CAN'T.

41:49.681 --> 41:51.639
BECAUSE WHY?

41:51.639 --> 41:53.946
WELL...

41:53.946 --> 41:55.382
BECAUSE IT'S...

41:55.382 --> 41:58.080
IT'S NOT THE RIGHT PLACE
FOR YOU ANYMORE.

41:58.080 --> 42:00.126
HOW COME?

42:00.126 --> 42:03.912
WELL, YOU REMEMBER
WHEN BAILEY GRADUATED
FROM HIGH SCHOOL,

42:03.912 --> 42:05.871
AND THEN HE WENT
TO A NEW PLACE?

42:05.871 --> 42:07.307
COLLEGE?

42:07.307 --> 42:09.265
THAT'S RIGHT.
COLLEGE.

42:09.265 --> 42:12.965
WELL, NOW IT'S TIME
FOR YOU TO GRADUATE.

42:12.965 --> 42:16.272
IT'S TIME FOR YOU
TO GO TO A NEW PLACE
FOR BIGGER BOYS.

42:16.272 --> 42:19.580
WHAT IF I WANT
TO GO TO JENNY'S?

42:21.974 --> 42:24.367
DON'T YOU WANT TO BE LIKE
YOUR BIG BROTHER BAILEY?

42:24.367 --> 42:27.327
DON'T YOU WANT
TO BE BRAVE,

42:27.327 --> 42:30.939
AND SAY, "I CAN DO THAT,"
JUST LIKE A BIG BOY WOULD?

42:32.898 --> 42:37.206
CAN YOU COME UP HERE
AND SIT WITH ME
FOR A MINUTE?

42:37.206 --> 42:38.730
THERE WE GO.

42:41.254 --> 42:43.735
YOU'RE GONNA BE OK,
AREN'T YOU?

42:45.867 --> 42:47.869
I'M PROUD OF YOU, OWEN.

42:47.869 --> 42:50.219
YOU'RE A VERY GROWN UP
LITTLE BOY.

42:50.219 --> 42:51.873
LIKE BAILEY?

42:51.873 --> 42:53.222
LIKE BAILEY.

42:53.222 --> 42:54.746
AND YOU?

42:58.880 --> 43:00.055
AND ME.

43:21.381 --> 43:24.384
All: GOD,
GRANT ME THE SERENITY

43:24.384 --> 43:27.387
TO ACCEPT THE THINGS
THAT I CANNOT CHANGE,

43:27.387 --> 43:30.956
THE COURAGE TO CHANGE
THE THINGS THAT I CAN,

43:30.956 --> 43:32.827
AND THE WISDOM
TO KNOW THE DIFFERENCE...
