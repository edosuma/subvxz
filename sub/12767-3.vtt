AND HOW LONG HAS THIS BEEN
GOING ON, THE INSOMNIA?

09:35.709 --> 09:38.500
UH, SINCE MY HUSBAND DIED
LAST YEAR.

09:38.542 --> 09:40.875
BUT LATELY, IT'S WORSE.

09:40.917 --> 09:42.875
ANYTHING CHANGED?

09:42.917 --> 09:45.667
AREN'T YOU JUST SUPPOSED
TO WRITE A PRESCRIPTION?

09:45.709 --> 09:47.625
SURE.

09:52.083 --> 09:54.208
I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT
TO UNDERSTAND

09:54.250 --> 09:56.041
WHAT'S BEHIND THE INSOMNIA,

09:56.083 --> 09:58.417
TO TALK ABOUT IT.

09:58.458 --> 10:01.709
I, UH...

10:01.750 --> 10:03.208
YOU KNOW, I, UM,

10:03.250 --> 10:05.500
I REALLY--
I JUST NEED TO SLEEP.

10:05.542 --> 10:08.125
LINDA, THE--THE MEDICATION
WILL HELP,

10:08.166 --> 10:10.250
BUT WHATEVER'S KEEPING YOU
FROM SLEEPING,

10:10.291 --> 10:12.667
IT'S NOT
GONNA TAKE THAT AWAY.

10:12.709 --> 10:15.667
TALK TO ME.
SEE IF I CAN HELP.

10:21.583 --> 10:24.667
I'M AFRAID OF HIM.

10:24.709 --> 10:27.375
AFRAID OF WHOM?

10:27.417 --> 10:29.166
MY SON.

10:29.208 --> 10:31.583
I THINK HE'S A SOCIOPATH.

10:31.625 --> 10:34.000
HE KILLED OUR DOG.

10:43.166 --> 10:45.125
I JUST--
I FOUND IT IN THE GARAGE.

10:45.166 --> 10:48.917
HE WAS WRAPPED IN A BLANKET,
AND I THINK HIS NECK WAS BROKEN.

10:48.959 --> 10:52.500
AND IT WAS
JUST A LITTLE BEAGLE.
WHY DO YOU THINK JESSE
WOULD DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT?

10:52.542 --> 10:54.625
I DON'T KNOW.
DID YOU ASK HIM?

10:54.667 --> 10:57.625
YES, AND HE JUST LOOKED AT ME.
HE GAVE ME THIS FUNNY LOOK.

10:57.667 --> 11:01.041
BUT HE'S THE ONLY ONE
WHO HAD ACCESS TO THE GARAGE.
IS HE EVER VIOLENT? HAVE YOU
EVER SEEN THIS BEFORE?

11:01.083 --> 11:04.166
NO. SEE, THAT'S THE THING.
HE WAS SO...

11:05.750 --> 11:08.208
(sighs) BUT WHEN
HIS FATHER DIED, HE CHANGED.

11:08.250 --> 11:11.291
HE GOT, UM, COLD.

11:11.333 --> 11:14.500
LIKE HE...
HE DOESN'T REACT.

11:14.542 --> 11:16.709
HE DOESN'T LAUGH.
HE DOESN'T CRY.

11:16.750 --> 11:19.041
HE JUST HAS THIS COLD,
HARD STARE,

11:19.083 --> 11:21.041
AND I--IT JUST...

11:21.083 --> 11:23.917
YOU KNOW, HE'S MY OWN SON,
AND I CAN'T--

11:23.959 --> 11:26.834
EVERYONE HAS THEIR OWN WAY
OF RESPONDING TO GRIEF.

11:26.875 --> 11:28.834
IT'S NOT GRIEF.

11:30.083 --> 11:33.041
(sighs)
I-I JUST NEED TO SLEEP.

11:33.083 --> 11:34.959
I'D LIKE TO TALK TO HIM.

11:35.000 --> 11:37.625
NO. I-I REALLY WANT
THOSE PILLS.

11:37.667 --> 11:40.792
LINDA, YOU DON'T NEED THE PILLS.
YOU NEED SOME HELP.

11:40.834 --> 11:43.792
LET ME HELP.

11:43.834 --> 11:45.041
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

11:45.083 --> 11:47.792
FISHING, THE BOAT,

11:47.834 --> 11:51.041
THE SUN ON THE WATER...

11:51.083 --> 11:53.041
IF ANY OF MY GUYS FIND OUT,

11:53.083 --> 11:55.041
IT'S GONNA BE
THE END OF ME, DONE.

11:55.083 --> 11:57.041
KEEP TRYING TO RELAX.
FOCUS ON FISHING.

11:57.083 --> 12:01.000
IT DOESN'T WORK ANYMORE.
I NEED THE PANTIES AND BRA.

12:01.041 --> 12:03.291
HOW DID THIS START, FRANK?

12:03.333 --> 12:06.792
IT WAS JUST KNEE-HIGHS
AROUND THE HOUSE AT FIRST.

12:06.834 --> 12:09.792
AND THEN I GOT MY HANDS
ON A MAIL ORDER CATALOG,

12:09.834 --> 12:15.500
AND... PAGES AND PAGES
OF PRETTY LITTLE THINGS--

12:15.542 --> 12:18.041
LACE BRAS...

12:18.083 --> 12:19.917
SILK PANTIES...

12:19.959 --> 12:21.709
(beeping slows)

12:21.750 --> 12:23.792
(whispers) GARTERS.

12:23.834 --> 12:25.792
I SEE WHAT YOU MEAN.

12:25.834 --> 12:29.834
I HAVE TO LIVE WITH THESE GUYS
24 HOURS AT A TIME.

12:29.875 --> 12:32.041
I ALMOST GOT CAUGHT
TWICE ALREADY.

12:32.083 --> 12:34.083
IF THEY FIND OUT...

12:34.125 --> 12:35.917
MY CREDIBILITY...

12:35.959 --> 12:39.333
THEY WON'T TRUST ME.

12:39.375 --> 12:40.834
THEY WON'T LISTEN.

12:40.875 --> 12:43.417
AND IF I HAVE TO LOOK
AT A MAN'S FAMILY

12:43.458 --> 12:45.959
AND TELL THEM HE'S NOT
COMING HOME BECAUSE--

12:46.000 --> 12:47.959
CROSS-DRESSING COULD GO
TO SOMETHING DEEPER,

12:48.000 --> 12:49.959
SOMETHING A THERAPIST
COULD HELP WITH.

12:50.000 --> 12:52.625
NO.
I CAN'T TELL ANYBODY ELSE.

12:52.667 --> 12:54.291
FRANK, I'M--
PLEASE.

12:54.333 --> 12:57.208
LOOK, I TRUST YOU.
YOU HELPED ME BEFORE.

12:57.250 --> 12:59.208
I KNOW YOU CAN HELP ME NOW.

12:59.250 --> 13:00.834
YOU HAVE TO...

13:00.875 --> 13:03.667
OR I'M... DONE.

13:07.709 --> 13:09.709
HOW'D IT GO?

13:09.750 --> 13:11.500
THE FIBROID'S HISTORY.

13:11.542 --> 13:14.375
IT WAS NICE TO BE BACK
IN THE SADDLE AGAIN.

13:14.417 --> 13:16.917
I HAVE A NEWBORN WITH
A DIAPHRAGMATIC HERNIA

13:16.959 --> 13:18.125
BEING AIRLIFTED IN.

13:18.166 --> 13:20.792
DON'T YOU HAVE SOMEONE ELSE?
I DO HAVE PATIENTS.

13:20.834 --> 13:22.792
DOUBLE BOARD CERTIFIED
NEONATAL SURGEONS

13:22.834 --> 13:25.375
AREN'T EXACTLY
WALKING THE STREETS, MONTGOMERY.

13:25.417 --> 13:28.959
LOOK, I HATE TO TAKE YOU AWAY
FROM ALL THE FUN AT THE OFFICE,

13:29.000 --> 13:31.959
BUT ON THE BRIGHT SIDE, YOU GET
TO SAVE A LIFE AND WORK WITH ME.

13:32.000 --> 13:34.500
OKAY, I'M IN.

13:34.542 --> 13:36.583
CHARLOTTE, THAT NEWBORN
BEING AIRLIFTED...

13:36.625 --> 13:40.291
YOU DON'T HAVE SOMEBODY ELSE.
YOU KNEW I'D SAY YES.
I HOPED.

13:40.333 --> 13:43.709
YOU'RE WOOING ME WITH SURGERY.
I AM.

13:43.750 --> 13:45.000
(laughs)

13:46.959 --> 13:49.041
HEY, DID YOU HEAR ABOUT DELL?

13:49.083 --> 13:51.041
HE'S NURSING AT ST. AMBROSE.

13:51.083 --> 13:53.375
SO NOW YOU WANT
TO TALK ABOUT DELL?
WELL, YEAH.

13:53.417 --> 13:55.041
NAOMI--
(Sam) HEY, NAI,
ADDISON'S STAYING

13:55.083 --> 13:57.959
AT THE HOSPITAL
TO DO ANOTHER SURGERY.

13:58.000 --> 13:59.709
COULD YOU COVER HER PATIENTS?
UH, SURE.

13:59.750 --> 14:01.417
COOL.
(Cooper) SAM.

14:01.458 --> 14:03.792
YES.
GOOD OL' BOSS SAM,
YOU WILL BE GLAD TO KNOW,

14:03.834 --> 14:06.041
I HAVE A NEW PATIENT.
HEY, ONE NEW PATIENT.

14:06.083 --> 14:08.166
MAYBE WE CAN BUILD
A NEW WING.

14:08.208 --> 14:10.166
WHAT ABOUT YOU?
DON'T YOU HAVE A CONSULT?

14:10.208 --> 14:13.959
I CAN'T DO IT.
MY MORNING CONSULT--MAJOR DRAMA.

14:14.000 --> 14:16.041
IT MAY TAKE THE REST OF THE DAY,

14:16.083 --> 14:18.417
SO CANCEL EVERYONE ELSE
YOU HAD BOOKED.

14:21.083 --> 14:23.583
I KNOW HE'S ONLY A YEAR OLD,

14:23.625 --> 14:26.583
BUT YOU WAIT ALL THIS TIME
TO HAVE A BABY,

14:26.625 --> 14:28.250
YOU WANT HIM TO BE PERFECT,

14:28.291 --> 14:31.041
AND I'M--I'M JUST REALLY WORRIED
THAT HE'S--THAT--

14:31.083 --> 14:33.542
THAT THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG
WITH HIM, YOU KNOW, WITH...

14:33.583 --> 14:34.875
HIS HEAD.
HIS HEAD?

14:34.917 --> 14:37.750
HIS HEAD.
WHAT'S WRONG WITH HIS HEAD?

14:37.792 --> 14:40.750
IT'S... BIG. NOT "BIG FOR
A 1-YEAR-OLD BODY" BIG,

14:40.792 --> 14:43.417
BUT "BIG FOR ANYBODY'S BODY"
BIG.

14:43.458 --> 14:45.417
BABIES ARE SOMETIMES BORN
WITH LARGE HEADS,

14:45.458 --> 14:48.500
BUT IF YOU GIVE IT SOME TIME,
THEY USUALLY GROW INTO 'EM.

14:48.542 --> 14:50.834
IT'S NOT--
IT'S A REALLY BIG HEAD.

14:52.959 --> 14:55.125
OKAY. LET'S TAKE A LOOK.

14:57.083 --> 14:59.041
HEY THERE, LITTLE FELLA.

14:59.083 --> 15:02.667
(baby fussing)

15:05.083 --> 15:07.834
YOU KNOW, JUST TO BE
ON THE SAFE SIDE,

15:07.875 --> 15:12.667
I'M GONNA RUN SOME TESTS, SEE IF
THERE'S ANYTHING GOING ON.

15:12.709 --> 15:14.041
(Violet) SO YOUR MOM SAID

15:14.083 --> 15:17.792
IT LOOKED LIKE THE DOG'S NECK
HAD BEEN BROKEN.

15:17.834 --> 15:19.834
ANY IDEA HOW THAT HAPPENED?

15:22.083 --> 15:25.291
IT--IT WAS IN YOUR GARAGE.

15:25.333 --> 15:27.959
ANY IDEA ABOUT THAT?

15:29.959 --> 15:32.750
IT WAS A BEAGLE, RIGHT?

15:32.792 --> 15:34.125
DODGER?

15:34.166 --> 15:38.667
YOUR MOM SAID YOU HAD IT
SINCE, UH, YOU WERE 6.

15:38.709 --> 15:41.291
IS THAT RIGHT?

15:41.333 --> 15:43.750
OKAY. THE DOG'S
TOO LOADED A TOPIC.

15:43.792 --> 15:46.041
UH...

15:46.083 --> 15:49.625
WHY DON'T WE TALK ABOUT
YOUR FATHER?

15:49.667 --> 15:51.834
WERE THE TWO OF YOU CLOSE?

15:51.875 --> 15:53.834
DID HE COACH
ANY OF YOUR TEAMS?

15:53.875 --> 15:57.750
I HEAR YOU'RE
A GREAT BASEBALL PLAYER.

15:57.792 --> 16:00.667
OKAY, I GET IT.
YOU DON'T WANT TO BE HERE.

16:00.709 --> 16:02.875
A LOT OF PEOPLE

16:02.917 --> 16:04.875
DON'T LIKE TO TALK
ABOUT DIFFICULT THINGS.

16:04.917 --> 16:06.875
BUT I HAVE A JOB TO DO,

16:06.917 --> 16:09.458
AND THAT IS TO FIND OUT
IF THERE'S A PROBLEM HERE,

16:09.500 --> 16:12.750
AND TO DO THAT,
I NEED FOR US TO TALK...

16:12.792 --> 16:16.166
ABOUT ANYTHING.

16:16.208 --> 16:18.959
I WANT TO GET TO KNOW YOU,
JESSE.

16:22.709 --> 16:25.458
CAN I GO NOW?

16:25.500 --> 16:26.917
PLEASE.

16:31.834 --> 16:34.125
DELL?

16:34.166 --> 16:36.041
HEY.

16:36.083 --> 16:38.750
SO YOU'RE WORKING HERE?

16:38.792 --> 16:41.041
YOU LOOK NICE...
IN YOUR SCRUBS.

16:41.083 --> 16:43.041
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE,
NAOMI?

16:43.083 --> 16:46.125
I JUST CAME BY TO SAY HI.

16:46.166 --> 16:48.208
IT'S GREAT TO SEE YOU.

16:48.250 --> 16:50.500
WE'VE MISSED YOU.

16:50.542 --> 16:53.959
I'VE MISSED--
I REALLY CAN'T TALK RIGHT NOW.
I GOT A TON OF PATIENTS.

16:54.000 --> 16:56.458
DELL.
I'M SORRY. I GOTTA GO.

17:11.875 --> 17:15.750
I JUST SAW THIS KID WHO HAD
A HEAD THE SIZE OF...

17:15.792 --> 17:18.458
IT WAS GINORMOUS.
IT WAS HUGE.

17:18.500 --> 17:20.959
WHICH IS BIGGER,
GINORMOUS OR HUGE?

17:21.000 --> 17:22.667
IS IT...

17:22.709 --> 17:24.667
WHO'S THE TRUANT?

17:24.709 --> 17:26.667
CONSULT'S SON.

17:26.709 --> 17:29.041
HE WON'T TALK,
SO I'M LETTIN' HIM STEW.

17:29.083 --> 17:31.667
IS STEWING A REAL
THERAPEUTIC TECHNIQUE?

17:31.709 --> 17:33.667
USUALLY WORKS WITH YOU.

17:33.709 --> 17:35.417
WHAT'S HE STEWING ABOUT?

17:35.458 --> 17:37.792
HIS MOTHER THINKS HE KILLED
THE FAMILY DOG.

17:37.834 --> 17:41.667
OH. STEP ONE, RIGHT?
I MEAN, THAT'S WHAT THEY SAY

17:41.709 --> 17:43.667
ABOUT SERIAL KILLERS,
AM I RIGHT?
OH, HE'S NOT
A SERIAL KILLER. I--

17:43.709 --> 17:46.250
WELL, NOT NOW.
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
IF HE DID IT.

17:46.291 --> 17:48.250
IS THE MOM LYING?
SHE BELIEVES HE DID IT.

17:48.291 --> 17:50.875
I-I DON'T KNOW HIS SIDE
'CAUSE HE WON'T TALK TO ME.

17:50.917 --> 17:52.875
HE--HIS FATHER'S DEAD,
HIS DOG IS DEAD.

17:52.917 --> 17:55.041
HE'S GOT A LOT OF REASON
TO BE ANGRY.

17:55.083 --> 17:57.250
YOU KNOW, HIS MOTHER THINKS
HE'S A SOCIOPATH.

17:57.291 --> 18:00.333
SHE GOES ON THE INTERNET,
SHE PUTS TOGETHER THE SIGNS--
IS HE?

18:00.375 --> 18:02.917
I DON'T KNOW.
I GUESS I COULD TEST HIM...

18:02.959 --> 18:03.834
(chuckles)

18:03.875 --> 18:06.875
GIVE HIM THE M.M.P.I.

18:06.917 --> 18:08.875
IT WOULD BE SO MUCH EASIER

18:08.917 --> 18:11.834
IF HE JUST HAD A PIPE BOMB
IN HIS BOOK BAG.

18:11.875 --> 18:15.041
YOU KNOW--DO YOU KNOW HOW RARE
A TRUE SOCIOPATH IS?

18:15.083 --> 18:18.041
YOU DON'T WANT TO BE THE ONE
THAT MISSED COLUMBINE.

18:28.083 --> 18:30.917
YOU DON'T WANT TO TALK.
I GET IT.

18:30.959 --> 18:32.750
LEAVES ME
WITH A PROBLEM, THOUGH.

18:32.792 --> 18:35.333
I HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT YOU,

18:35.375 --> 18:37.333
AND I'M NOT COMFORTABLE

18:37.375 --> 18:41.667
WITH JUST WATCHING YOU
WALK OUT THAT DOOR.

18:41.709 --> 18:44.375
DON'T TALK TO ME.
JUST FILL THIS OUT.

18:44.417 --> 18:47.000
TRUE/FALSE.

18:51.000 --> 18:54.583
OR WE CAN SIT HERE
ALL DAY.

19:05.333 --> 19:07.709
(clicks pen)

19:15.083 --> 19:18.041
OKAY, JUST SO WE'RE CLEAR,
THIS IS NOT A DATE.

19:18.083 --> 19:20.041
THIS IS A SANDWICH
BETWEEN SURGERIES.

19:20.083 --> 19:22.041
POINT IS, IT'S GETTING
TO KNOW EACH OTHER

19:22.083 --> 19:24.208
WITHOUT ALL THAT DATE CRAP.
MM.

19:24.250 --> 19:26.291
TELL ME ABOUT THIS CASE
YOU'VE BEEN WORKING ON.

19:26.333 --> 19:29.041
YOU KNOW, THE ONE
THAT'S KEPT YOU FROM CALLING.

19:29.083 --> 19:32.041
I WATCHED TWO PEOPLE DIE.
IT KINDA MADE FOR A BAD WEEK.

19:32.083 --> 19:35.500
YEAH. I HAVE BEEN HAVING
A RUN OF THOSE MYSELF.

19:35.542 --> 19:38.166
NOT PEOPLE DYING, JUST PEOPLE
NOT TALKING TO ME...

19:38.208 --> 19:39.166
MM-HMM.

19:39.208 --> 19:41.166
PEOPLE NOT TALKING
TO EACH OTHER.

19:41.208 --> 19:44.166
ALL THE PEOPLE IN MY OFFICE
ARE WALKING AROUND PISSED OFF,

19:44.208 --> 19:46.542
AND NOBODY'S TALKING ABOUT IT.

19:46.583 --> 19:50.041
THAT'S WHY I'M HERE...
CUTTING PEOPLE OPEN.

19:50.083 --> 19:52.417
GETTING OUT YOUR HOSTILITIES.

19:52.458 --> 19:55.041
ACTUALLY... YOU PUT
A SCALPEL IN MY PALM,

19:55.083 --> 19:57.458
AND I FEEL CENTERED.

19:57.500 --> 20:01.875
ALL THE OTHER PROBLEMS
IN THE WORLD JUST FALL AWAY.

20:03.667 --> 20:05.792
IT'S HARD TO EXPLAIN.

20:05.834 --> 20:08.041
WELL, YOU CAN EXPLAIN IT TO ME
TOMORROW NIGHT

20:08.083 --> 20:10.041
WHEN I TAKE YOU OUT.
(mouth full)
YOU'RE TAKING ME OUT?

20:10.083 --> 20:12.041
I AM.
ON A DATE?

20:12.083 --> 20:14.041
YES.
(Charlotte) YOU'RE
NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

20:14.083 --> 20:15.959
PREGNANT LADY
WITH OVARIAN TORSION.

20:16.000 --> 20:19.041
O.R.'s READY.
YOU UP FOR IT, MONTGOMERY?
YEAH. MM.

20:19.083 --> 20:22.041
YEAH, NO, GO. CUT PEOPLE OPEN.
ALL RIGHT. I'LL SEE YOU,
UM, TOMORROW NIGHT.

20:22.083 --> 20:24.000
TOMORROW NIGHT.
OKAY.

20:24.041 --> 20:26.000
YOU KNOW, WE COULD USE YOU.

20:26.041 --> 20:27.208
(normal voice)
SORRY. EXCUSE ME?

20:27.250 --> 20:29.208
HERE.
YOU COULD BE A SURGEON.

20:29.250 --> 20:32.208
I COULD KEEP THE O.R. FULL
AND THE BOARD HAPPY.

20:32.250 --> 20:34.041
IT'S A SYMBIOTIC RELATIONSHIP.

20:34.083 --> 20:35.917
I HAVE A JOB, CHARLOTTE.

20:35.959 --> 20:37.917
YOU'RE A SURGEON, ADDISON.

20:37.959 --> 20:40.250
I'LL THINK ABOUT IT.

20:40.291 --> 20:41.875
BIG.

20:41.917 --> 20:43.667
HOW BIG?

20:43.709 --> 20:46.834
MOUNT RUSHMORE BIG.

20:46.875 --> 20:48.834
I'M THINKING, LIKE,
PAGET'S DISEASE

20:48.875 --> 20:50.834
OR ACROMEGALY
OR TUBEROUS SCLEROSIS.

20:50.875 --> 20:53.834
I MEAN, THIS POOR KID'S
GONNA BE, LIKE, A BOBBLEHEAD

20:53.875 --> 20:55.041
IF I CAN'T FIX HIM.

20:55.083 --> 20:57.083
AT LEAST HE WON'T BE
WEARING A BRA.

20:57.125 --> 20:59.250
UNLESS IT'S TO GIVE
HIS HEAD MORE SUPPORT.

20:59.291 --> 21:02.041
I KEEP TELLING YOU,
IT'S NOT THAT UNUSUAL.

21:02.083 --> 21:04.959
IT'S A COPING MECHANISM,
AND YOU SAID HE'S COPING.
YEAH, BUT--

21:05.000 --> 21:07.250
I GOT A MAYBE SOCIOPATH
WHO MAYBE KILLED HIS DOG

21:07.291 --> 21:09.250
WHO MAYBE I SHOULD LOCK UP.

21:09.291 --> 21:12.041
YOU GOT A BRA AND PANTIES.
YOU WANT TO TRADE?
WHAT HAPPENED WITH YOUR TEST?

21:12.083 --> 21:13.917
IT'S INCONCLUSIVE.

21:13.959 --> 21:17.041
DOES HE LIKE TO SMASH THINGS?
YES. DOES HE FEEL ANGER? YES.

21:17.083 --> 21:19.041
THE ONLY WAY TO KNOW
IF HE'S A TRUE SOCIOPATH

21:19.083 --> 21:21.041
IS TO DO A COMPREHENSIVE
CLINICAL EVALUATION,

21:21.083 --> 21:23.709
AND THE KID'S NOT TALKING.
SO BASED ON THIS TEST,

21:23.750 --> 21:25.709
HE DOESN'T MEET THE CRITERIA
FOR ME TO HOLD HIM.

21:25.750 --> 21:27.709
HE'S NOT A CLEAR DANGER
TO ANYONE.

21:27.750 --> 21:29.750
THERE'S NOT
A CREDIBLE THREAT...

21:29.792 --> 21:32.834
EXCEPT I STILL DON'T KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE DOG.

21:34.917 --> 21:37.792
DOES ANYONE
HAVE ANYTHING HELPFUL TO SAY?

21:37.834 --> 21:40.041
YEAH. AT LEAST
HE DOESN'T HAVE A BIG HEAD.

21:40.083 --> 21:42.000
OR WEAR PANTIES.

21:46.083 --> 21:47.333
I'VE RESECTED THE CYST.

21:47.375 --> 21:50.000
I JUST HAVE TO
DETORSE THIS OVARY.

21:50.041 --> 21:53.041
MONTGOMERY, THEY NEED YOU
IN NICU NOW.

21:53.083 --> 21:56.041
BABY YOU WORKED ON BEFORE,
0-2 SATs ARE DROPPING.

21:56.083 --> 22:00.041
CRAP. OKAY, LET ME JUST FINISH
LIGATING THIS VESSEL.

22:00.083 --> 22:05.041
LET ME JUST TAKE A LOOK AT
THE BABY, MAKE SURE IT'S OKAY.

22:05.083 --> 22:07.041
DONE.

22:07.083 --> 22:09.000

22:15.083 --> 22:16.792

22:16.834 --> 22:18.792

REMOVED THE CYST.

22:18.834 --> 22:20.792

22:28.834 --> 22:30.792
FOUR.
WHAT ABOUT YOUR KNEE?

22:30.834 --> 22:33.000

WOW. YOU'RE A BADASS.

22:33.041 --> 22:35.000

22:40.083 --> 22:41.959
HEY, NAI. SO WHAT'S UP?

22:42.000 --> 22:43.959
I, UH, JUST FINISHED
GOING OVER THE BUDGET.

22:44.000 --> 22:46.458
I CAN'T BELIEVE
THERE'S ALL THIS PAPERWORK.

22:46.500 --> 22:49.041
I FEEL LIKE
I'M DOING SIX JOBS NOW,

22:49.083 --> 22:51.417
AND NONE OF 'EM
IS SEEING MY PATIENTS.

22:51.458 --> 22:53.875
YEAH, WELL, IT'S, UH,
IT'S TOUGH BEING THE BOSS.

22:53.917 --> 22:58.041
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT HIRING
A MARKETING CONSULTANT?
IF YOU THINK IT'LL HELP.

22:58.083 --> 23:00.500
RIGHT?
MM-HMM.

23:00.542 --> 23:02.417
ALL RIGHT. THANKS.

23:02.458 --> 23:03.875
CAN YOU BELIEVE HIM?

23:03.917 --> 23:06.041
I MEAN, DOES HE NOT THINK

23:06.083 --> 23:09.041
THAT I DID THE EXACT SAME THINGS
WHEN I WAS IN CHARGE?

23:09.083 --> 23:12.041
ONLY I WASN'T STUPID ENOUGH
TO TRY AND DO IT ALL BY MYSELF.

23:12.083 --> 23:14.458
AT LEAST I HAD DELL TO HELP
ME MANAGE TO RUN THINGS

23:14.500 --> 23:16.709
SO THAT I COULD SEE PATIENTS.

23:16.750 --> 23:19.250
I SAW HIM TODAY--DELL--
AT THE HOSPITAL.

23:19.291 --> 23:21.041
IT WAS REALLY WEIRD--

23:21.083 --> 23:24.000
I HAVE A PATIENT.
I GOTTA GO.

23:25.917 --> 23:28.667
SO YOU'RE TELLING ME
HE'S NORMAL?

23:28.709 --> 23:30.875
ONE TEST OVER ONE HOUR
IS NOT GONNA ANSWER THAT,

23:30.917 --> 23:33.583
BUT THIS DOES EVALUATE
PERSONALITY AND PSYCHOPATHOLOGY.
WHAT ABOUT THE DOG?

23:33.625 --> 23:35.792
HE WON'T TALK TO ME
ABOUT THAT RIGHT NOW.

23:35.834 --> 23:39.041
BUT MAYBE IF THE TWO OF YOU
CAME IN TOGETHER, THEN--
NO, I CAN'T CONFRONT HIM.

23:39.083 --> 23:41.667
YOU TOLD ME
TO BRING HIM IN HERE.

23:41.709 --> 23:44.083
YOU SAID THAT--
THAT YOU COULD HELP ME,

23:44.125 --> 23:47.041
AND NOW HE KNOWS
THAT I'M SCARED OF HIM. IT'S--
NO, I DIDN'T TELL HIM--

23:47.083 --> 23:49.041
HE'S SMART.

23:49.083 --> 23:51.750
YOU THINK HE'S NOT
GONNA FIGURE THIS OUT?

23:51.792 --> 23:53.542
LOOK, I CAN'T...

23:53.583 --> 23:55.875
HE HAD THAT DOG
FOR TEN YEARS, AND HE...

23:55.917 --> 23:58.625
(voice breaking) HE DIDN'T
SHED A TEAR WHEN IT DIED.

23:58.667 --> 24:01.041

BUT YOU HAVEN'T MENTIONED
HER NAME.
I...

30:00.083 --> 30:02.083
I DON'T KNOW HER NAME.

30:02.125 --> 30:05.041
IT'S HEATHER.
HER NAME'S HEATHER.

30:05.083 --> 30:07.792
AND THIS IS THE THIRD TIME
SHE'S BEEN PREGNANT.

30:07.834 --> 30:10.041
WE LOST TWO BABIES BEFORE.

30:10.083 --> 30:12.792
SHE KEEPS REDECORATING
THE NURSERY,

30:12.834 --> 30:14.792
HOPING THAT
THAT'S GONNA CHANGE THINGS.

30:14.834 --> 30:18.166
IT'S RED NOW. WHO... WHO EVER
HEARD OF A RED NURSERY?

30:18.208 --> 30:19.959
BUT HER STUDENTS--

30:20.000 --> 30:22.458
HER STUDENTS TOLD HER
THAT IT WOULD BE GOOD LUCK,

30:22.500 --> 30:24.500
AND SHE WANTED
TO BELIEVE THEM.

30:24.542 --> 30:27.291
YOU OPERATED
ON HER TWICE TODAY.

30:27.333 --> 30:29.542
YOU SHOULD'VE KNOWN HER NAME.

30:43.083 --> 30:45.500
YOU'RE DOING WELL, FRANK.

30:45.542 --> 30:48.041
A FEW WEEKS, YOU SHOULD BE
UP AND AROUND.

30:48.083 --> 30:49.500
AND THEN WHAT?

30:49.542 --> 30:52.041
I TOLD YOU, I'M DONE.

30:52.083 --> 30:54.542
I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT'S TRUE.
I'M RESIGNING.

30:54.583 --> 30:57.125
THESE GUYS DEPEND ON ME.

30:57.166 --> 30:59.125
IF THEY CAN'T
FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH ME,

30:59.166 --> 31:02.125

31:02.166 --> 31:04.583
WE ALL FEEL STRESS, FRANK.
YOU MORE THAN MOST.

31:04.625 --> 31:07.959
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU FOUND
A WAY TO DEAL WITH IT.

31:08.000 --> 31:10.041
SOME PEOPLE DRINK TOO MUCH,
SOME EAT TOO MUCH,

31:10.083 --> 31:13.041
SOME PEOPLE... RUN.

31:13.083 --> 31:15.041
I WISH I HAD A THING
THAT WORKED.

31:15.083 --> 31:17.041
WHEN EVERYTHING AROUND YOU
IS FALLING APART

31:17.083 --> 31:19.458
AND YOU NEED
TO KEEP IT TOGETHER,

31:19.500 --> 31:21.041
A THING IS GOOD.

31:21.083 --> 31:24.041

A BRA AND PANTIES FOREVER?

31:24.083 --> 31:26.583

TO SOMEONE,

31:26.625 --> 31:30.041

ALL OF THAT STRESS YOURSELF,

31:30.083 --> 31:31.709

31:31.750 --> 31:34.417
FINE. I'LL GO TO THERAPY.

31:34.458 --> 31:37.041

31:37.083 --> 31:39.041

32:05.583 --> 32:07.959

32:08.000 --> 32:11.709

A BUNCH OF PEOPLE NOT TALKING,

32:11.750 --> 32:15.208

BEING THE ONE NOT TALKING...

32:15.250 --> 32:19.542

32:19.583 --> 32:22.083

32:27.083 --> 32:29.041
THAT'S NOT A DOCTOR,

32:29.083 --> 32:32.000

THE BEST.

32:36.500 --> 32:38.959

CHARLOTTE,

32:39.000 --> 32:42.000

YES.

33:08.125 --> 33:09.875

33:09.917 --> 33:12.917
THE OTHER KIDS COULD ALL
RUN FASTER. I HATED P.E.

33:12.959 --> 33:16.709
MY BEST FRIEND BRAD, HE HAD
TWO TEETH THAT NEVER GREW IN.

33:16.750 --> 33:20.083
HE'S THE C.E.O.
OF A FORTUNE 500 COMPANY NOW.

33:20.125 --> 33:22.083

33:22.125 --> 33:24.083

IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER.

33:24.125 --> 33:26.041

MAYBE.

33:26.083 --> 33:29.542
MAYBE HE'LL BE A BULLY.
MAYBE HE'LL BE PRESIDENT.

33:29.583 --> 33:32.333

33:57.417 --> 33:59.834

DIDN'T THINK I COULD HELP YOU

33:59.875 --> 34:02.166
IF YOU WOULDN'T TALK TO ME.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

34:02.208 --> 34:05.959

NO. YOU LET THIS GO.

34:09.000 --> 34:11.959

TO PUT A DOG DOWN?

34:29.417 --> 34:31.041
DO YOU?

34:31.083 --> 34:32.625
HE HAD CANCER.

34:32.667 --> 34:34.792
IT WAS THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS
TO TREAT HIM,

34:34.834 --> 34:36.375
AND SHE WAS GONNA DO IT.

34:36.417 --> 34:38.375
MY DAD'S CANCER
ALMOST BANKRUPTED US,

34:38.417 --> 34:40.041

34:40.083 --> 34:41.375

WE DIDN'T HAVE THAT EITHER.

SO I DID WHAT I HAD TO DO.

34:59.083 --> 35:02.041

35:05.250 --> 35:08.458

35:08.500 --> 35:10.333

35:10.375 --> 35:13.333
BECAUSE MY DAD SAID
I HAD TO BE THE MAN.

35:13.375 --> 35:16.000
I HAD TO BE RESPONSIBLE.

35:20.667 --> 35:22.041
