WEBVTT

00:01.461 --> 00:03.245
Well, you, me,
and the cupcakes are ready,

00:03.297 --> 00:05.381
now, we just need people.

00:06.383 --> 00:07.332
Ooh, here we go!

00:07.334 --> 00:09.319
This one looks like she might come in.

00:10.921 --> 00:13.071
Yeah, keep walking, ugly!

00:13.073 --> 00:15.557
Ugly?
She's like a supermodel.

00:15.559 --> 00:17.342
Did she come in and buy something?

00:17.344 --> 00:19.678
- No.
- Then, she ugly.

00:19.680 --> 00:21.563
Okay, yes, business is slow,

00:21.565 --> 00:23.765
but we don't
have to drop to that level.

00:23.767 --> 00:26.569
Ooh, this guy is definitely coming in.

00:27.571 --> 00:29.821
Keep walking, fatty!

00:29.823 --> 00:32.607
And he ugly.

00:34.328 --> 00:35.728
Welcome to Max's homemade cupcakes!

00:35.729 --> 00:39.230
Hello.
How much are your cupcakes?

00:39.232 --> 00:40.449
$4.

00:40.451 --> 00:41.719
No.

00:43.721 --> 00:45.403
Whore.

00:45.405 --> 00:47.456
Jinx, you owe me a coke!

00:47.458 --> 00:49.040
We both called an old lady a whore.

00:49.042 --> 00:50.759
I know!
We are in complete sync.

00:50.761 --> 00:53.079
That is so good for business.

00:54.681 --> 00:57.082
I'll give you $3.

00:57.084 --> 00:58.517
I'm sorry, they're $4.

00:59.019 --> 01:01.288
There's no one in here.
You'll take what you get.

01:03.790 --> 01:05.892
I'm in love with that whore.

01:06.894 --> 01:09.194
â™ª Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

01:10.648 --> 01:14.716
â™ª Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh â™ª

01:23.083 --> 01:25.168
Hello. I'm calling
from Max's Homemade Cupcakes

01:25.170 --> 01:28.554
to acquaint you with our new
"Mornings with Max's" special.

01:28.556 --> 01:32.375
No, sir, that is not
what our special is.

01:32.377 --> 01:34.457
And I haven't even done that
with my boyfriend yet,

01:34.458 --> 01:36.145
so don't be rude.

01:36.147 --> 01:38.281
Give me that phone.

01:38.283 --> 01:41.517
Ya fat, ya ugly, ya fugly.

01:42.969 --> 01:45.404
Max, we have got to get
more business going.

01:45.406 --> 01:47.086
The money Sophie gave us
to open the shop

01:47.087 --> 01:48.941
will only cover next month's rent.

01:48.943 --> 01:50.910
Wait, we already have
next month's rent?

01:50.912 --> 01:52.472
Why are we worried?
We're doing better

01:52.473 --> 01:54.664
than everyone else in America.

01:54.666 --> 01:58.650
Well, well, well,
if it isn't Prince Charming.

01:58.652 --> 02:00.753
But, Earl, is Prince Charming,

02:00.755 --> 02:04.423
or is he just a diva in purple?

02:04.425 --> 02:07.126
So psyched. Finally got
a personalized hello from Earl.

02:07.128 --> 02:08.461
He called me Prince Charming.

02:08.463 --> 02:10.795
I'm in, baby, I am in.

02:10.798 --> 02:12.014
I wouldn't get too excited.

02:12.016 --> 02:14.300
He probably just forgot your name.

02:14.302 --> 02:18.888
He calls every Puerto Rican guy
that comes in here "La Bamba."

02:21.358 --> 02:22.775
Max's Homemade Cupcakes.

02:23.277 --> 02:25.728
Yes, I'll hold.

02:25.730 --> 02:29.482
Of course we do sugar-free
and gluten-free.

02:30.484 --> 02:32.444
I'll be right back,
I just gotta take this call.

02:32.445 --> 02:35.788
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm, I understand,
but, like, how diabetic?

02:35.790 --> 02:38.690
I feel a little sick to my stomach.

02:38.692 --> 02:41.410
Why? You haven't even
eaten here yet.

02:41.412 --> 02:42.995
No, I'm nervous.

02:42.997 --> 02:45.077
I came here to tell Caroline
something kind of big.

02:45.078 --> 02:47.249
What? You have
a secret family on Long Island?

02:47.251 --> 02:49.535
- No.
- You have Hep-C? "D"?

02:49.537 --> 02:52.004
- One of the new heps?
- No.

02:52.006 --> 02:53.506
I don't have any of the heps.

02:53.508 --> 02:55.257
Wow. Now, telling her
I'm in love with her

02:55.259 --> 02:56.708
is just going to sound boring.

02:57.210 --> 02:59.211
You're gonna tell her you love her?

02:59.213 --> 03:00.646
Here in the diner?

03:00.648 --> 03:03.983
Why, was the dump closed?

03:03.985 --> 03:07.553
Hey, we need more coffee, La Bamba.

03:07.555 --> 03:10.406
Andy, this isn't where
you tell someone "I love you."

03:10.408 --> 03:14.059
This is where you tell someone
their sex change looks passable.

03:14.061 --> 03:15.394
What's the big deal?

03:15.396 --> 03:16.996
If I feel it, why shouldn't I say it?

03:16.998 --> 03:18.564
I think she'd be all over that.

03:18.566 --> 03:20.783
Nope. If it didn't happen
to Kate Hudson

03:20.785 --> 03:22.084
in some stupid romantic comedy,

03:22.086 --> 03:24.036
then it won't work for Caroline.

03:24.538 --> 03:26.705
Sorry, what? I left
and went into another theater

03:26.707 --> 03:28.674
in my mind while you were talking.

03:29.376 --> 03:32.044
I know, it's so creepy,
but she likes it.

03:32.046 --> 03:34.079
Really, if you could
arrange for it to rain,

03:34.081 --> 03:36.048
or run after her
to the airport in the rain,

03:36.050 --> 03:38.300
but somehow end up on top
of the Empire State building

03:38.302 --> 03:40.603
on Valentine's Day, that'd be best.

03:40.605 --> 03:42.988
Well, I just sold three dozen cupcakes,

03:42.990 --> 03:45.526
we just have to mark "No sugar"
on one of the boxes.

03:49.595 --> 03:50.955
So what did you want to say to me?

03:50.956 --> 03:52.931
No, nothing, just came by to say hi.

03:52.933 --> 03:55.601
I gotta go download a couple movies.

03:56.303 --> 03:57.821
Hey, Oleg.
Where's my food?

03:59.923 --> 04:01.290
Cheeseburger with fries,

04:01.292 --> 04:03.775
pick-up.

04:03.777 --> 04:05.461
Han, you look so tall in the window.

04:05.463 --> 04:09.248
Tell me the truth, are you
standing on another tiny person?

04:11.617 --> 04:12.819
No.

04:15.505 --> 04:17.225
On the box.

04:19.927 --> 04:21.177
Oleg had to leave.

04:21.178 --> 04:22.978
Sophie came back
from her trip to Poland,

04:22.980 --> 04:25.731
and he's worried, 'cause
she's very, very depressed.

04:25.733 --> 04:28.134
Why, did she see you in that hair net?

04:28.136 --> 04:30.236
Come on, listen,
when Sophie went to see

04:30.238 --> 04:31.904
her new house, there was no house.

04:31.906 --> 04:34.857
Her Polish contractor
ripped off her money.

04:35.859 --> 04:38.444
Poor Sophie.
I feel terrible.

04:38.446 --> 04:40.329
I know what it feels like
to be ripped off.

04:40.331 --> 04:43.332
I once bought a Fendi purse,
but when I looked inside,

04:43.334 --> 04:45.984
it said "Rendi."

04:46.986 --> 04:50.539
What kind of god would let that happen?

04:51.041 --> 04:53.959
Max, I went to a party with that.

04:54.361 --> 04:56.295
We should stop by after work,
see how she is,

04:56.297 --> 04:58.297
and bring her
some of her favorite cupcakes.

04:58.299 --> 05:01.433
Or you could give her
that $20,000 she loaned you.

05:01.435 --> 05:04.186
Loaned us? Sophie gave us
that money as a gift.

05:04.188 --> 05:06.672
Not what I hear.
Pick-up!

05:07.174 --> 05:09.341
And we're out of spaghetti.
There's no sauce.

05:09.343 --> 05:11.009
No, Han, there's plenty of sauce.

05:11.011 --> 05:14.113
I know, but I can't reach the shelf.

05:18.718 --> 05:21.687
Hey, are we sure that money
Sophie gave us was a gift?

05:21.689 --> 05:24.540
Yes. She gave it to us
to support our dream.

05:24.542 --> 05:26.525
I know when I had money,
I gave it out freely,

05:26.527 --> 05:28.661
and never expected anything in return.

05:28.663 --> 05:31.413
Like when I gave my maid
that gorgeous Rendi.

05:31.915 --> 05:34.633
Well, I don't know about
people not expecting stuff back.

05:34.635 --> 05:36.201
One time, a guy bought me a slushy,

05:36.203 --> 05:38.837
and for the next three weeks,
he owned me.

05:38.839 --> 05:41.707
No, he really owned me.

05:41.709 --> 05:45.477
Eight days in, I almost
got traded to a trucker.

05:46.713 --> 05:48.347
And I wouldn't even mention her gift.

05:48.349 --> 05:50.382
It will only insult her, and I promise,

05:50.384 --> 05:53.903
nobody is expecting us
to give the money back.

05:53.905 --> 05:57.222
Come in, girls.
Did you bring the check?

05:57.224 --> 06:00.892
No, because it was a gift...
a big-ass gift,

06:01.394 --> 06:04.613
but we brought our love
and we brought cupcakes.

06:04.615 --> 06:06.699
Well, I doubt she'll eat them.

06:06.701 --> 06:10.052
She hasn't even touched her <i>kapusniak,</i>

06:10.054 --> 06:12.004
which is the dish traditionally served

06:12.006 --> 06:15.574
to Polish women who have been
wronged by their contractors.

06:16.976 --> 06:19.411
Such a specific culture.

06:19.413 --> 06:21.096
But that's not the worst thing.

06:21.098 --> 06:23.465
She is so depressed, no sex,

06:23.467 --> 06:25.100
which is big problem for me,

06:25.102 --> 06:29.305
because I find
depressed women very hot.

06:30.107 --> 06:31.607
A lot of guys do.

06:31.609 --> 06:34.760
Why do you think I haven't
paid for a drink in six years?

06:34.762 --> 06:37.196
I'll go in and tell her you're here.

06:37.198 --> 06:42.034
She's just lying there
on the bed, lifeless, hot...

06:42.036 --> 06:45.237
The big tease.

06:50.777 --> 06:52.777
Sophie, the two girls
who you loaned the money to

06:52.778 --> 06:54.747
are here to see you.

06:54.749 --> 06:56.582
It was a gift.

06:56.584 --> 06:59.117
A generous, generous gift,
but still a gift.

06:59.119 --> 07:01.453
Are we sure about that?
'Cause I was slushy boy's bitch

07:01.455 --> 07:04.807
for three weeks, and I did things.

07:04.809 --> 07:07.142
Look, Max brought you cupcakes,

07:07.144 --> 07:10.346
your favorite: Vanilla
with a bacon fat drizzle.

07:10.848 --> 07:14.566
No, I can't eat
when I've been betrayed.

07:14.568 --> 07:17.353
What kind again?

07:17.355 --> 07:21.106
Sophie, I am patient man,
but I am also horny man.

07:21.108 --> 07:23.609
Any idea when you will
snap out of this?

07:23.611 --> 07:27.479
Oh, why don't you just unzip
and climb on top of me now

07:27.481 --> 07:29.164
and get it over with?

07:29.166 --> 07:31.166
- Oh, no.
- Well, we should be going.

07:31.168 --> 07:33.035
No, girls, stay.

07:33.037 --> 07:36.755
If she's not even going to
put up a fight, what's the fun?

07:37.257 --> 07:38.674
Are you sure?

07:38.676 --> 07:41.427
Bacon drizzle, little bit of heaven.

07:41.429 --> 07:43.512
No, I don't want them.

07:43.514 --> 07:45.497
Okay, let's put the cupcakes here,

07:45.499 --> 07:47.299
in case you change your mind.

07:47.801 --> 07:50.019
- Is this a gun?
- Ooh!

07:50.021 --> 07:53.856
Yes. I'm not going to
stab myself to death.

07:53.858 --> 07:57.026
Do you know how much this outfit costs?

07:57.028 --> 07:59.010
Sophie, you're going to
get through this.

07:59.012 --> 08:01.697
And by the way,
you look amazing in black.

08:01.699 --> 08:05.234
Oh, well, no more
bright colors for me now.

08:05.236 --> 08:07.286
I'm in mourning.

08:07.288 --> 08:11.290
See?
Black bra, black garters,

08:11.292 --> 08:13.592
and look, black panties.

08:13.594 --> 08:17.379
Um, you're not wearing any panties.

08:17.381 --> 08:20.031
I'm not?

08:20.033 --> 08:21.417
Oh.

08:21.419 --> 08:24.803
I'm sorry about
that wild mess down there.

08:26.405 --> 08:28.891
Sophie, I feel bad you got ripped off.

08:28.893 --> 08:32.544
Here are all my tips $27.

08:32.796 --> 08:35.263
For eight hours?

08:35.265 --> 08:38.350
Oh, now, I'm depressed for you.

08:38.352 --> 08:40.969
You want to borrow my gun?

08:40.971 --> 08:43.638
You know what? I think
you just need to eat something,

08:43.640 --> 08:46.307
and pretty soon,
you'll be back to your old self:

08:46.309 --> 08:49.310
A woman who gives gifts
and expects nothing in return,

08:49.312 --> 08:51.997
'cause that's what a gift is.

08:53.783 --> 08:56.418
Sophie, is that doing anything for you?

08:56.420 --> 08:59.538
Yeah, well, I'm not hating it.

08:59.540 --> 09:02.758
Here, this soup smells amazing.

09:02.760 --> 09:05.043
Oh, no. I don't have
the energy to eat.

09:05.045 --> 09:08.447
Sophie, open your mouth
and put this in.

09:08.449 --> 09:12.634
Oh, come on.
Now you're as bad as Oleg.

09:12.636 --> 09:13.869
There. Better?

09:13.871 --> 09:16.855
That's cold.

09:16.857 --> 09:20.809
Sophie, just say the word,
and I will rob a bank for you.

09:20.811 --> 09:22.694
Sophie, I understand you're hurting,

09:22.696 --> 09:24.980
but we've already spent
most of the money on the shop,

09:24.982 --> 09:27.532
and business just isn't good.

09:27.534 --> 09:30.786
It's not the money.
Everybody thinks it's the money.

09:30.788 --> 09:32.320
It's more than that.

09:32.322 --> 09:35.540
My lake house was my dream,
and I lost my dream.

09:35.542 --> 09:36.875
Oh, thank God!

09:36.877 --> 09:39.044
Well, I'm glad that's cleared up.

09:39.046 --> 09:40.712
Not about the money.

09:40.714 --> 09:43.298
Max, come on, she's had a shock,
we should let her sleep.

09:43.300 --> 09:46.668
You girls are so lucky.
You still have your dream.

09:46.670 --> 09:49.304
Well, Sophie, what if you
were part of our dream?

09:49.306 --> 09:50.806
I'm sorry?
Whose dream?

09:50.808 --> 09:52.174
Our dream.

09:52.176 --> 09:55.877
Your dream?
Where's that cupcake?

09:55.879 --> 09:58.546
Look, Sophie's the only reason
we have a shop.

09:58.548 --> 09:59.988
We should make her, like, a partner.

09:59.989 --> 10:02.234
Mmm! Partner!

10:02.236 --> 10:04.352
But you and I are already partners.

10:04.354 --> 10:06.321
I feel like we're kind of
partnered out.

10:06.323 --> 10:08.023
What about a silent partner?

10:08.025 --> 10:11.559
Mmm! Silent partner!
Yeah, I like that.

10:11.561 --> 10:14.863
Mmm! I'm getting
my appetite back,

10:14.865 --> 10:17.866
and also, my sex drive.

10:18.618 --> 10:22.087
Go or stay, girls.
Either way, I'm going in.

10:24.000 --> 10:30.074

10:31.302 --> 10:33.869
I'm sorry I said Sophie
could be part of the store.

10:33.871 --> 10:36.005
I just felt bad for her, lying there,

10:36.007 --> 10:40.642
all in black, too sad
to even make her junk pretty.

10:40.644 --> 10:44.163
It's fine. "Silent partner" is
just a figurehead role anyway,

10:44.165 --> 10:46.699
and it's nice to know
you have such a big heart.

10:46.701 --> 10:47.933
It's not my heart.

10:47.935 --> 10:50.153
What I saw down there changed me.

10:52.155 --> 10:53.715
It looks like something an animal built

10:53.716 --> 10:56.058
to live in for the winter.

11:02.715 --> 11:05.784
Wait, what is
Sophie's chandelier doing here?

11:05.786 --> 11:08.303
Is this the Polish version
of a home invasion?

11:08.305 --> 11:11.273
They break in
and leave something tacky?

11:11.775 --> 11:14.459
Good morning, partners.

11:14.461 --> 11:18.597
I didn't know the dress code,
so I went business casual.

11:18.599 --> 11:23.852
Look, the chandelier that
I bought for my lake house.

11:23.854 --> 11:26.054
Oh, now our dreams are together.

11:26.056 --> 11:29.608
Sophie, it's not
the look we were going for.

11:29.610 --> 11:33.446
Oh, I know.
Much better, right?

11:33.998 --> 11:36.014
That is definitely not our style.

11:36.016 --> 11:39.968
It looks like a Tim Burton movie
just spit up in here.

11:39.970 --> 11:41.720
I think it's kind of pretty.

11:41.722 --> 11:43.222
But what do I know?

11:43.224 --> 11:46.558
I once spent my last 50 bucks
on a frog pinata.

11:46.560 --> 11:48.760
Had to have it.

11:50.564 --> 11:52.314
Max's Homemade Cupcakes.

11:52.316 --> 11:54.950
Yes, we're an upscale bakery, and...

11:54.952 --> 11:57.319
Now, we sell hoagies.

11:57.821 --> 12:00.289
Oh, no, no, no, sir,
we do not sell hoagies.

12:00.291 --> 12:01.957
Yes, we do.

12:02.959 --> 12:05.877
How many would you like?
Let me get a pen.

12:10.383 --> 12:11.667
What's happening?

12:11.669 --> 12:14.452
Are we finally gonna trash Caroline?

12:14.454 --> 12:15.804
No, I need your help.

12:15.806 --> 12:17.486
I watched four chick flicks
back-to-back,

12:17.487 --> 12:18.887
then I made a list of possible ways

12:18.888 --> 12:20.142
to tell Caroline I love her.

12:20.144 --> 12:24.096
I was gonna make more,
but I got my period.

12:25.598 --> 12:29.401
Okay, run the choices past me.

12:29.403 --> 12:31.436
Whichever one makes me
want to hurl the most,

12:31.438 --> 12:33.238
that's your winner.

12:33.240 --> 12:35.400
I could play a song for her
outside of her apartment,

12:35.401 --> 12:38.694
but keep in mind how hard it is
to find a boom box in 2012.

12:38.696 --> 12:40.979
Yeah, plus, if you do that
outside our apartment,

12:40.981 --> 12:42.648
you'll be shot.

12:42.650 --> 12:44.766
By me.

12:44.768 --> 12:47.953
Okay, what about
sharing cocoa and a hot dog

12:47.955 --> 12:49.654
on the ice rink in Central Park?

12:49.656 --> 12:50.956
Yup, that's it.

12:50.958 --> 12:52.374
Makes me want to take my head off

12:52.376 --> 12:53.625
and throw it into the street.

12:53.627 --> 12:55.858
Cool.
Oh, and, Max,

12:55.859 --> 12:57.579
I think I'm the only
straight guy on earth

12:57.580 --> 12:59.540
who knows the difference
between Dylan McDermott

12:59.541 --> 13:02.801
and Dermott Mulroney,
and that, my friend, is love.

13:04.987 --> 13:07.122
Oh, what's
that funky-ass smell?

13:07.124 --> 13:10.692
Do they finally sell pepperoni febreze?

13:11.194 --> 13:13.261
Max, this already isn't working.

13:13.263 --> 13:15.847
The stinky salami,
the gaudy chandelier?

13:15.849 --> 13:18.817
It's like a haunted Quiznos in here.

13:18.819 --> 13:21.953
Hey, I'm sending Oleg to Queens

13:21.955 --> 13:24.823
to pick up
a flat of Fresca. Yeah.

13:24.825 --> 13:26.425
There's nothing better with a hoagie

13:26.427 --> 13:28.493
than an ice-cold Fresca.

13:29.295 --> 13:31.029
That's what I wanted!

13:31.031 --> 13:32.914
Look...

13:32.916 --> 13:36.534
They'll go great with the pickled eggs!

13:38.270 --> 13:41.673
This just went from my dream
to a nightmare.

13:41.675 --> 13:44.393
Oh, my God, Caroline!
It is you!

13:44.395 --> 13:47.346
Stacy, no way! I haven't
seen you since graduation.

13:47.348 --> 13:49.031
We went to Wharton together.

13:49.033 --> 13:51.066
This girl is a genius.

13:51.068 --> 13:52.934
Always top of the class.

13:52.936 --> 13:54.519
So what are you doing here?

13:54.521 --> 13:57.389
Buying a cupcake on your way
to running the world?

13:57.391 --> 13:59.241
No, I own this shop.

13:59.243 --> 14:02.944
Oh. You own
this little cupcake shop?

14:02.946 --> 14:06.081
And many other bigger shops.

14:06.083 --> 14:08.333
This is our new Williamsburg location.

14:08.335 --> 14:10.452
And yes, I know,
the chandelier is all wrong.

14:10.454 --> 14:12.170
I told the designer, none of our

14:12.172 --> 14:15.073
Pacific Northwest locations
will have the chandeliers.

14:15.075 --> 14:18.710
Of course, you'd own
a cupcake empire at 25.

14:19.212 --> 14:21.546
- Oh, and this is Max.
- Hi.

14:21.548 --> 14:25.384
I just transferred
from our Boise location.

14:26.853 --> 14:28.937
What's that horrible smell?

14:29.439 --> 14:31.723
It's something called
a "hoagie."

14:31.725 --> 14:34.476
The workers like them.
Right, Max?

14:34.478 --> 14:39.431
<i>Si, gracias por la</i> hoagie.

14:39.433 --> 14:40.699
Well, I have to go.

14:40.701 --> 14:42.767
I'm consulting upstairs at BBD&L.

14:42.769 --> 14:44.653
- Oh, upstairs.
- Yeah.

14:44.655 --> 14:46.455
Always knew you'd land on your feet.

14:46.457 --> 14:50.459
Let's go for drinks,
and you're paying, mogul.

14:52.412 --> 14:55.163
I hope she likes water.

14:55.165 --> 14:58.250
Now what am I going to do?
Stacy's in the building.

14:58.252 --> 15:01.052
Well, you could move to Narnia
and run that branch,

15:01.054 --> 15:04.089
you pathological liar.

15:04.091 --> 15:06.892
Max, this is not
how I want people to see me,

15:06.894 --> 15:09.261
or smell me, quite frankly.

15:09.263 --> 15:11.629
We have to get rid
of the salami, the chandelier,

15:11.631 --> 15:13.932
and the Sophie.
This is our dream, not hers.

15:13.934 --> 15:15.817
Okay, fine, I'll tell her.

15:16.519 --> 15:19.237
Hey, Sophie, can we talk to you?

15:19.239 --> 15:20.939
Good news, girls.

15:20.941 --> 15:24.025
Now we sell scratchers.

15:24.727 --> 15:26.978
But I have even a better idea.

15:27.480 --> 15:30.782
You two should dress up as big cupcakes

15:30.784 --> 15:33.285
and pass out free samples.

15:36.121 --> 15:38.790
Sophie, Max has something
she wants to say to you.

15:38.792 --> 15:40.292
Wait.

15:40.294 --> 15:43.512
Girls, I have something to say first.

15:45.832 --> 15:50.835
Two days ago, I was
on the verge of suicide.

15:50.837 --> 15:54.506
Yeah, seriously,
I hadn't eaten all afternoon.

15:54.508 --> 15:58.176
But your generosity with your dream

15:58.178 --> 16:02.614
has given me a reason
to get up and get a wax.

16:02.616 --> 16:04.366
Yeah.

16:04.368 --> 16:09.154
Oh. Max, there was something
you wanted to say?

16:09.456 --> 16:12.325
I was going to say...

16:17.729 --> 16:19.215
You look delicious.

16:20.917 --> 16:23.868
I look like
Honey Boo Boo's mom at the prom.

16:31.690 --> 16:33.940
This is so humiliating.

16:33.942 --> 16:35.392
Now I know how Tyra felt

16:35.394 --> 16:37.978
when she went undercover
as that fat person.

16:37.980 --> 16:40.147
Please tell me this is our bottom.

16:40.149 --> 16:42.616
Well, it's your bottom.
I went to happy hour once

16:42.618 --> 16:44.618
and woke up naked
in the penguin habitat

16:44.620 --> 16:46.853
at the Bronx zoo.

16:46.855 --> 16:48.357
And I did things.

16:51.359 --> 16:52.742
Hey, girls.

16:52.744 --> 16:55.579
What are you two doing
just standing there?

16:55.581 --> 16:58.965
God gave cupcakes legs for a reason.

16:58.967 --> 17:01.084
You need to hit the streets,

17:01.086 --> 17:05.472
shake your cake maker,
and show people your goods.

17:05.473 --> 17:07.757
Hey, don't look at me, it's vanilla.

17:07.759 --> 17:09.559
I was looking forward to going up

17:09.560 --> 17:11.011
to complete strangers on the street

17:11.012 --> 17:14.347
and saying "eat me,"
but she won't leave.

17:14.348 --> 17:17.684
Well, if you're not going to
go out and get the customers,

17:17.685 --> 17:19.769
then I'll have to bring
the customers to you.

17:19.771 --> 17:23.056
I gotta do everything around here.

17:24.659 --> 17:26.790
Seriously, I can't believe
we're just standing here

17:26.791 --> 17:28.912
when we could be chasing
fat people down the street,

17:28.914 --> 17:32.565
yelling, "you ate my brother!"

17:32.567 --> 17:34.117
Look at you two.

17:34.119 --> 17:36.286
What I wouldn't give
for a giant glass of milk.

17:36.288 --> 17:37.671
Look at you, though.

17:37.673 --> 17:38.922
You look so cute.

17:38.924 --> 17:40.240
No, don't look at me.

17:40.242 --> 17:42.175
I'm totally embarrassed in this thing.

17:42.177 --> 17:44.844
Yes, she's cute and embarrassed,

17:44.846 --> 17:48.382
in a larger-than-life,
colorful, public setting.

17:49.884 --> 17:50.867
Ah, right.

17:50.869 --> 17:53.186
So, Caroline, listen, I wanted to...

17:53.188 --> 17:56.673
Look, girls, some young professionals.

17:56.675 --> 17:58.642
Oh, my God!
She's bringing Stacy.

17:58.644 --> 18:00.694
She can't see me in this.
I was her valedictorian.

18:00.696 --> 18:03.246
Take this.

18:05.483 --> 18:09.953
Oh! Ugh!
Oh! Wait.

18:09.955 --> 18:12.072
Help me up, Max!
Help me up!

18:12.074 --> 18:14.576
Oh, great.
Now you're like my mom.

18:16.578 --> 18:18.545
Here, give me your left hand.

18:19.547 --> 18:21.548
Okay, give me your right hand.

18:22.250 --> 18:25.335
Get up! Get up!
Five second rule.

18:33.894 --> 18:35.762
Ugh!

18:36.264 --> 18:38.631
What are you two crazy cakes doing?

18:38.633 --> 18:41.268
You lost your customers.
They ran away.

18:41.270 --> 18:43.069
Oh, thank God.

18:43.071 --> 18:44.604
Oh, I don't get it.

18:44.606 --> 18:47.324
You won't push the hoagies
or the pickled eggs.

18:47.326 --> 18:51.027
You must really have a fear of success.

18:52.730 --> 18:54.748
Well, at least we missed Stacy.

18:54.750 --> 18:57.367
Well, you know
what else you missed? Andy.

18:57.369 --> 18:59.485
He was about to tell you he loves you.

18:59.487 --> 19:00.820
What?

19:00.822 --> 19:03.156
Just now, in the hall,
and at the ice rink.

19:03.158 --> 19:05.125
He's been trying to tell you all week.

19:05.127 --> 19:07.210
But I've been
too preoccupied with work,

19:07.212 --> 19:11.348
like Sandra Bullock in <i>The Proposal.</i>

19:11.350 --> 19:14.050
So he was gonna tell me
at the ice rink?

19:14.052 --> 19:15.552
The one in Central Park?

19:15.554 --> 19:19.189
Yes, while having cocoa
and splitting a hot dog.

19:19.191 --> 19:20.673
Oh, my God!

19:20.675 --> 19:23.276
That's, like,
my dream "I love you" scenario.

19:23.778 --> 19:25.729
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

19:26.031 --> 19:27.781
Because when it comes to other people's

19:27.783 --> 19:31.117
creepy love stuff, that's
when I'm a silent partner,

19:31.119 --> 19:34.487
and you need to stop
with this creepy rom-com stuff.

19:34.489 --> 19:35.989
Life isn't like a movie.

19:35.991 --> 19:38.658
Sometimes you're not
a success right away

19:38.660 --> 19:41.211
sometimes you have to just
eat it and be a cupcake,

19:41.213 --> 19:43.696
and sometimes you have to
take your "I love you"

19:43.698 --> 19:45.632
whichever way it comes.

19:46.134 --> 19:47.584
You are so right.

19:47.586 --> 19:49.626
I don't have to wait
for the moment to be perfect,

19:49.627 --> 19:50.947
like it was for Reese Witherspoon

19:50.948 --> 19:53.973
in <i>Sweet Home Alabama.</i>

19:53.975 --> 19:56.209
My life's not a romantic comedy.

19:56.211 --> 19:57.811
I can do it my own way.

19:57.813 --> 20:00.681
Like Julia Roberts in
<i>My Best Friend's Wedding.</i>

20:08.656 --> 20:10.690
Andy, it's me!

20:10.692 --> 20:11.975
I'll be right out.

20:11.977 --> 20:13.510
No, this can't wait any longer.

20:13.512 --> 20:15.645
I don't need
a big romantic comedy moment.

20:15.647 --> 20:16.913
No...

20:16.915 --> 20:18.331
Oh!
Oh.

20:18.333 --> 20:19.999
Oh, sorry.
I thought it was the office!

20:20.001 --> 20:21.751
Not the office.

20:22.753 --> 20:24.037
I'm stuck.

20:24.039 --> 20:26.623
Oh, I want to go, but I can't.

20:26.625 --> 20:29.259
And I'll never be able to go again.

20:29.961 --> 20:32.762
Well, I'm on the toilet
and you're in a cupcake.

20:32.764 --> 20:36.099
Can't get creepier than this,
so, Caroline,

20:36.301 --> 20:38.101
I love you.

20:39.303 --> 20:41.738
I love you too.

20:42.773 --> 20:45.442
Oh, please, push me out.

20:49.096 --> 20:51.431
How'd it go?
Was it romantic?

20:51.433 --> 20:54.317
He told me he loved me on the toilet.

20:54.319 --> 20:57.070
Oh, man!
That's my dream scenario!

20:58.072 --> 20:59.322
Hey.

20:59.324 --> 21:01.624
I'm only gonna do this for an hour,

21:01.626 --> 21:03.626
to show you how it's done,

21:03.628 --> 21:05.628
and then I'm out.

21:05.630 --> 21:07.914
This is your dream, not mine.

21:07.916 --> 21:10.900
Cupcakes!
Free cupcakes!

21:11.402 --> 21:13.269
Come on, get 'em!

21:13.271 --> 21:15.457
Get 'em while they're hot!

21:17.459 --> 21:21.826
