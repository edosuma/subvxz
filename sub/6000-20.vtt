(Carter) Previously on "Finding Carter"...

00:02.105 --> 00:04.143
(Carter) I have been
hanging out at Jared's.

00:04.168 --> 00:05.544
He's way too old for you.

00:05.569 --> 00:07.369
You don't get to tell me
who I can and can't date.

00:07.394 --> 00:08.492
If you live in this house,

00:08.517 --> 00:10.411
then you have to follow the rules.

00:10.436 --> 00:12.431
Well, maybe I need to find
somewhere else to live then.

00:12.456 --> 00:15.083
- My dad's up for parole.
- Max.

00:15.108 --> 00:17.269
I'm gonna try to get them
to keep him in prison.

00:17.294 --> 00:18.945
I did a background check on Jared.

00:18.970 --> 00:21.156
Did you know he's married
and has a daughter?

00:21.181 --> 00:22.797
Tell them it's not true, Jared.

00:22.822 --> 00:24.841
It's not how I wanted you to find out.

00:24.877 --> 00:28.736
I see a future with you and my little girl.

00:28.761 --> 00:30.368
I'm falling in love with you.

00:30.651 --> 00:34.453
It's very difficult for me
to watch you become a woman,

00:34.478 --> 00:37.383
because I didn't get to see
you being a little girl.

00:37.408 --> 00:38.783
I just need some space.

00:38.809 --> 00:40.175
(knocking)

00:40.200 --> 00:42.813
I was wondering if you wouldn't
mind me staying here with you.

00:42.838 --> 00:45.703

01:13.050 --> 01:15.627
I'm more of a cereal kind of gal now.

01:15.652 --> 01:16.911
Oh, um...

01:16.936 --> 01:19.031
Well, I could run out and get some cereal.

- Oh, no, no, no, it's okay.

This is the woman that kidnapped you.

02:18.409 --> 02:19.552
You realize that, right?

02:19.577 --> 02:21.460
I know that, thank you, I'm not stupid.

02:21.485 --> 02:22.357
I know you're not.

02:24.979 --> 02:26.146
Educated guess. Now, grab your things.

02:26.171 --> 02:28.567
- You can't be here.
- No, you can't be here, Mom.

02:28.592 --> 02:30.056
Carter, you're coming
home with me right...

02:30.082 --> 02:31.589
- Stop!
- No, let it go!

02:31.614 --> 02:32.897
It's not my place to get in the middle.

02:32.922 --> 02:36.783
You're absolutely right.
It's not your place.

02:38.165 --> 02:39.852
Carter, maybe you should just go.

02:39.877 --> 02:40.879
What?

02:40.904 --> 02:41.748
What are you trying to do?

02:41.773 --> 02:43.275
I'm trying to do what's best.

02:43.299 --> 02:46.162
And maybe it's best if you just go home.

02:49.002 --> 02:50.856
I can't believe either of you.

02:52.747 --> 02:54.636
Why don't you two stay
here and eat pancakes?

02:54.661 --> 02:57.557
I have to get ready for work.

02:57.582 --> 02:59.278
I mean, it's like Katniss

02:59.303 --> 03:00.664
staying at President Snow's house.

03:00.689 --> 03:02.111
I'm sure she has her reasons.

03:02.136 --> 03:03.116
Are you serious?

03:03.141 --> 03:04.654
She basically re-kidnapped herself.

03:04.679 --> 03:06.037
I know that it's weird,

03:06.062 --> 03:07.394
but it's not like Mom and Carter

03:07.419 --> 03:08.462
are getting along right now.

03:08.487 --> 03:10.272
That's Mom being Mom, you just gotta deal.

03:10.297 --> 03:11.485
Yeah, well, we've known Mom

03:11.510 --> 03:13.064
for a lot longer than Carter has.

03:13.089 --> 03:14.242
We're used to her.

03:14.267 --> 03:17.820
Apparently, we can't really
understand why Carter feels

03:17.845 --> 03:19.000
the way she does about Lori.

03:19.026 --> 03:20.593
I know how she should feel.

03:20.617 --> 03:22.880
Well, you can't tell
people how to feel, Grant.

03:22.905 --> 03:25.681
Yeah, and people don't change, Taylor.

03:25.706 --> 03:27.453
Well, maybe they would if they got on

03:27.478 --> 03:29.125
the right meds and got help.

03:29.558 --> 03:31.334
Have they brainwashed you, too?

03:31.359 --> 03:34.194
I'm just saying, she doesn't
seem like the same crazy woman.

03:34.219 --> 03:36.751

held you at gunpoint?

09:19.668 --> 09:21.212
thanks for coming in, ladies.

09:21.237 --> 09:24.246
Yeah, thank you, bye.

09:26.445 --> 09:28.829
She blamed it all on Jared.

09:28.854 --> 09:31.814
- I heard.
- I don't get it.

09:31.839 --> 09:35.738
He said she was this awful,
crazy terrible person.

09:35.763 --> 09:38.842
The woman in there was just... nice.

09:38.867 --> 09:41.425
And really pretty and
great taste in clothes,

09:41.450 --> 09:42.061
I must add.

09:42.086 --> 09:43.609
Not helping, Bird.

09:43.633 --> 09:45.142
Well, what are you gonna do?

09:45.167 --> 09:45.793
I don't know.

09:45.818 --> 09:46.919
I don't know who to believe now.

09:46.944 --> 09:48.461
But wouldn't all their custody stuff

09:48.486 --> 09:50.348
be filed in court documents?

09:50.373 --> 09:51.566
Wouldn't they tell the truth?

09:51.590 --> 09:53.110
Yeah, actually.

09:53.135 --> 09:55.299
Carter, everybody has
an ex that haunts them.

09:55.324 --> 09:57.657
Either it's a good haunt, like "Casper",

09:57.682 --> 10:00.192
or it's like the "Blair Witch".

10:00.218 --> 10:03.194
Either way, you gotta
figure out how to deal.

10:03.756 --> 10:05.466
Yeah.

10:05.491 --> 10:07.624
You know what the worst part about this is?

10:07.649 --> 10:09.305
That the guy I'm seeing

10:09.330 --> 10:11.808
is still married and maybe a deadbeat dad?

10:11.833 --> 10:15.163
No. I really liked those shirts.

10:17.291 --> 10:19.900
Yeah, that truly is the worst part.

10:19.925 --> 10:23.803
(glasses clinking)

10:24.046 --> 10:26.507
I know it's a little early.

10:27.119 --> 10:28.456
Not by my watch.

10:28.481 --> 10:30.269
(chuckling)

10:30.365 --> 10:34.074
Consider this a peace offering.

10:34.099 --> 10:36.923
I had a terrible morning,

10:36.948 --> 10:40.419
and I took it out on you and your swatches,

10:40.443 --> 10:41.602
and I'm sorry.

10:41.628 --> 10:43.195
Accepted.

10:43.220 --> 10:44.386
This about David?

10:44.410 --> 10:46.694
No, David and I are fine, for once.

10:46.719 --> 10:48.354
I mean, it's hard having him away,

10:48.379 --> 10:50.666
but he offered to come home, and I said no.

10:50.691 --> 10:52.675
I can handle things here.

10:52.700 --> 10:55.484
Well, it's okay to ask for help sometimes.

10:57.863 --> 11:00.313
Here's the thing.

11:00.891 --> 11:02.974
Carter slept over at Lori's last night.

11:02.999 --> 11:04.049
Oh, Christ.

11:04.074 --> 11:05.374
And I went over there this morning.

11:05.399 --> 11:06.244
No!

11:06.269 --> 11:08.200
Yeah, I couldn't help it, Mom.

11:08.225 --> 11:10.528
And seeing them together, it was terrible.

11:10.553 --> 11:13.759
Well, I don't blame you,
though, honey, I really don't.

11:14.551 --> 11:18.486
Maybe it's time to back off from Carter

11:18.511 --> 11:20.304
for just a little bit, for
a little while, you know?

11:20.330 --> 11:22.975
Because whatever it is you're
doing, it's not really working.

11:23.000 --> 11:25.769
So I just continue to let her
do whatever she wants to do?

11:25.794 --> 11:27.598
Well, she's already doing
what she wants to do.

11:27.623 --> 11:30.474
Sometimes, you just gotta let
someone make their own mistakes.

11:30.499 --> 11:32.227
And it's really hard to watch.

11:32.252 --> 11:33.820
I know, honey.

11:34.292 --> 11:36.229
But you know, Carter is a survivor.

11:36.254 --> 11:38.366
I think she's gonna do okay.

11:38.818 --> 11:41.427
It's you I'm worried about.

11:44.815 --> 11:47.052
You know, I get that
it's hard to understand

11:47.077 --> 11:49.870
why our sister is staying
at her felon mother's house,

11:49.895 --> 11:51.840
but Grant has got to get used to it.

11:51.865 --> 11:53.296
(phone alert)

11:53.474 --> 11:55.254
Is that about your dad?

11:55.279 --> 11:57.576
No, it's my phone bill.

11:57.602 --> 11:59.641
I just went over my data again.

12:02.543 --> 12:05.008
When are you supposed to hear?

12:05.326 --> 12:07.233
Any day.

12:07.258 --> 12:08.681
God.

12:09.634 --> 12:11.888
Why does everything
have to be so stressful?

12:11.913 --> 12:14.246
Maybe you, me and Grant
should just go to your place,

12:14.271 --> 12:16.480
eat a bunch of junk food, watch a movie,

12:16.506 --> 12:20.592
away from our parents and
felons and grandmothers.

12:20.617 --> 12:22.090
Let's go, I'm ready.

12:22.114 --> 12:24.569
Will you just ask Grant for me?

12:24.594 --> 12:26.647
Because he's still mad at me.

12:27.381 --> 12:29.493
Please.

12:29.518 --> 12:31.025
Oh, hey, Grant.

12:31.050 --> 12:32.249
Yeah, I'm right across the hall.

12:32.274 --> 12:33.649
You know I can hear everything you say.

12:33.674 --> 12:34.920
So are you in?

12:34.945 --> 12:37.139
Fine, I guess.

12:37.164 --> 12:38.710

12:38.735 --> 12:41.069

12:41.465 --> 12:43.948
I'm gonna have to meet you guys there.

12:44.127 --> 12:46.942
I have to go take care of something.

12:51.933 --> 12:53.286
Hey.

12:53.311 --> 12:55.015
- Hey.
- Hey.

12:55.040 --> 12:59.310
God, I feel all incognito, like
a drug dealer or something.

12:59.335 --> 13:00.251
(chuckling)

13:00.276 --> 13:01.308
Thanks for meeting us.

13:01.333 --> 13:03.082
Yeah, of course.

13:03.107 --> 13:04.443
I miss you.

13:04.468 --> 13:06.500
Yeah, I miss you, too.

13:06.525 --> 13:08.059
Weird car hug?

Mm-hm.

13:10.036 --> 13:11.418
Hey, I want in on this.

13:11.443 --> 13:13.443
Get in.

13:18.815 --> 13:20.698
How are you?

13:20.833 --> 13:24.493
Good. Fine.

13:24.518 --> 13:26.804
Terrible, I don't know, how are you?

13:26.829 --> 13:28.379
I'm okay.

13:28.404 --> 13:31.019
Things at the house have been kind of weird

13:31.044 --> 13:32.635
since Mom figured out you were at Lori's.

13:32.659 --> 13:36.243
And then Grant found out,
and that was hard, but...

13:36.268 --> 13:37.731
I'm sorry.

13:37.756 --> 13:38.913
No, it's okay.

13:38.938 --> 13:41.027
I know you have your reasons.

13:41.053 --> 13:43.027
So what's up?

13:43.834 --> 13:46.108
I kind of need a favor.

13:46.133 --> 13:47.726
(Elizabeth) What are you asking me?

13:47.751 --> 13:50.630
You want me to open sealed court documents?

13:50.655 --> 13:52.096
Yes.

13:52.121 --> 13:54.209
What? You're the one who told Carter

13:54.234 --> 13:56.520
about the wife and the kid.

13:56.545 --> 13:58.096
Don't you want to know the details?

13:58.122 --> 14:00.153
Did Carter ask you to ask me?

14:00.177 --> 14:02.224
(scoffs) No.

14:02.249 --> 14:04.517
Oh, God, you're a horrible liar.

14:04.542 --> 14:07.475
Okay, first she's furious
when I investigated,

14:07.500 --> 14:09.337
and now she wants me to.

14:09.362 --> 14:10.661
What is the difference?

14:10.686 --> 14:13.674
I'm worried about her, I know
you're worried about her.

14:13.699 --> 14:15.041
Of course I am.

14:15.066 --> 14:17.602
But if she mistrusts Jared this much,

14:17.627 --> 14:19.496
maybe she should take that as a sign.

14:19.521 --> 14:21.263
Maybe she will.

14:21.288 --> 14:23.447
Depending on what you find.

14:24.056 --> 14:25.927
Why didn't she ask me herself?

14:25.952 --> 14:28.359
Because you guys aren't in
the best place right now.

14:28.384 --> 14:30.304
You know, I've made a
lot of mistakes lately,

14:30.329 --> 14:33.434
and snooping into Jared's
life might be one of them.

14:34.154 --> 14:37.239
And I had a very wise
woman tell me that I should

14:37.264 --> 14:40.175
let Carter make her own mistakes.

Yeah.

- You got a Pepper Patty?
- Yeah.

21:35.989 --> 21:37.404
No, that was totally uncool,

21:37.430 --> 21:38.645
we need to do something about it.

21:38.670 --> 21:40.211
We did something, we handled it.

Barely, Jared.

A riot? Oh, come on, what are you saying?

21:49.472 --> 21:52.133
I'm saying, I think we need security.

21:52.158 --> 21:53.534
More safeguards in place

21:53.559 --> 21:55.398
to make sure stuff like
that doesn't happen.

21:55.423 --> 21:56.990
Security is expensive.

21:57.015 --> 21:58.198
If we're not turning a profit,

21:58.223 --> 21:59.871
we can't keep throwing these parties.

21:59.896 --> 22:02.333
All right, well, yeah,
maybe we take in less,

22:02.358 --> 22:03.869
but we can't just ignore
something like that.

22:03.894 --> 22:05.956

she asked about our daughter.

Is that true? You went to her store?

22:36.367 --> 22:37.922
How old is she, Jared?

22:37.947 --> 22:39.804
They just keep getting younger and younger.

30:03.647 --> 30:05.766
Really? 'Cause you just said

30:05.791 --> 30:07.050
this was a noise complaint,

30:07.075 --> 30:08.938
and that sounds like a trespassing call.

30:08.963 --> 30:10.441
Are you questioning me?

30:10.466 --> 30:12.775
Yeah, yeah, I guess I am,

30:12.800 --> 30:14.655
'cause my mom's a cop, actually,

30:14.680 --> 30:16.452
for Fairfax County,

30:16.477 --> 30:19.397
and she is all about probable cause.

30:19.422 --> 30:21.467
She's also all about warrants,

30:21.492 --> 30:23.793
when they're needed.

30:27.195 --> 30:31.441
Not needed, but maybe keep the noise down.

30:31.790 --> 30:34.214
You all have a good evening.

30:37.291 --> 30:39.329
You gotta be careful with edibles, guys.

30:39.354 --> 30:40.603
First of all, you can't
leave it lying around

30:40.628 --> 30:41.641
for your little brother to take,

30:41.666 --> 30:43.181
but, in our experience,

30:43.206 --> 30:45.155
you never really know what you're getting.

30:45.242 --> 30:46.830
In your experience?

30:46.855 --> 30:49.006
My golfing buddy, Murray?

30:49.031 --> 30:50.313
He ate pot brownies.

30:50.338 --> 30:53.080
Threw off his entire equilibrium.

30:53.105 --> 30:55.451
His golf swing never recovered.

30:55.476 --> 30:58.025
In our day, pot was just pot. It was.

30:58.050 --> 30:59.850
Smoke it and then go about your day.

30:59.875 --> 31:01.481
That's old school. I like it.

31:01.505 --> 31:03.009
Yeah, and then your generation

31:03.034 --> 31:04.700
came along and mucked it up.

31:04.725 --> 31:06.108
Simpler times.

31:06.133 --> 31:09.534
Oh, you put pot in cookies
and coffee and pizza.

31:09.559 --> 31:10.725
Pot pizza?

31:10.750 --> 31:12.159
I mean, do we really need that?

31:12.184 --> 31:13.770
- Maybe.
- No.

31:13.795 --> 31:15.314
Look, okay, I can't judge,

31:15.339 --> 31:17.605
'cause I smoked at your
age, but you're too young.

31:17.630 --> 31:19.645
I thought they were
regular cookies, I swear.

31:19.669 --> 31:21.237
He's telling the truth.

31:21.262 --> 31:24.263
And I never would have let
him eat those if I had known.

31:24.288 --> 31:26.216
Yeah, and, look, I promise

31:26.241 --> 31:28.140
I won't touch the stuff
again until college,

31:28.165 --> 31:30.626
just please don't tell Mom.

31:30.771 --> 31:33.175
Well, your secret's safe with us.

31:33.297 --> 31:34.999
Why don't you sleep it
off at our house tonight,

31:35.024 --> 31:36.546
and we'll take you home in the morning.

31:36.571 --> 31:38.904
Besides, I... I made my famous pecan pie.

31:39.331 --> 31:41.197
Yeah, that sounds like
something I would need.

31:41.222 --> 31:42.938
Okay.

31:44.780 --> 31:47.680
Don't you think we should test it?

31:49.028 --> 31:51.687
Oh, my God, baby, you were so good.

31:51.712 --> 31:53.693
- Yeah?
- Seth.

31:53.718 --> 31:56.890
Seth, this is Elliot.

31:56.915 --> 31:58.836
Oh... hey.

31:58.861 --> 32:00.132
Um, nice to meet you.

32:00.157 --> 32:01.340
Thanks for coming.

32:01.365 --> 32:03.550
You were good. I liked you.

32:03.575 --> 32:04.564
Not like that, though.

32:04.589 --> 32:06.217
She's not into that.

32:06.242 --> 32:07.860
Sorry, I'll be quiet.

32:07.885 --> 32:08.943
E-mail me.

32:08.968 --> 32:11.395
Don't call me, e-mail me.

32:11.420 --> 32:13.169
Got it, thanks.

32:13.194 --> 32:14.200
Thanks.

32:14.225 --> 32:16.549
I'll e-mail you, too.

32:27.132 --> 32:29.596
Hey.

32:34.691 --> 32:36.741
Close call there with the cops.

32:36.766 --> 32:38.348
They were all talk.

32:38.373 --> 32:40.723
They didn't actually have anything on us.

32:41.519 --> 32:44.020
Told you she was capable of some crazy.

32:44.045 --> 32:45.344
Yeah, I know.

32:45.373 --> 32:47.006
Look, I'm...

32:47.031 --> 32:48.869
I'm really sorry.

32:48.894 --> 32:51.499
I should never have gone to her store.

32:51.524 --> 32:53.774
But to be fair, Jared,

32:53.799 --> 32:56.250
I didn't think she'd know who I was.

32:56.275 --> 32:58.038
Well, that's the thing about insane people.

32:58.063 --> 33:00.017
They're also pretty smart.

33:00.042 --> 33:02.399
I guess you know more about that than most.

33:02.423 --> 33:06.082
Yeah, pretty crazy to call the cops.

33:06.107 --> 33:08.167
I tried to warn you, but
you didn't want to listen,

33:08.192 --> 33:10.190
because you didn't trust me.

33:10.215 --> 33:14.029
So I guess we have bigger
issues than just my ex.

33:15.081 --> 33:17.206
Where are you going?

33:17.452 --> 33:19.085
I don't know.

33:19.110 --> 33:20.952
Look, Carter, my whole
relationship with her

33:20.977 --> 33:22.694
was fighting and drama,
and I can't do that again.

33:22.719 --> 33:23.990
That's not what we're doing, Jared.

33:24.015 --> 33:25.746
Then what are we doing? 'Cause it's obvious

33:25.771 --> 33:27.456
you don't trust me, and I have no interest

33:27.481 --> 33:29.196
in being in a relationship without trust.

33:29.221 --> 33:30.716
Okay, wait a second.

33:30.741 --> 33:32.738
I'm sorry I didn't just jump right back

33:32.763 --> 33:34.547
into trusting you right away, Jared,

33:34.572 --> 33:36.516
but can you seriously blame me?

33:36.541 --> 33:38.497
And are you actually
gonna walk away from this

33:38.522 --> 33:40.582
the second things start
to get a little bit hard?

33:40.607 --> 33:43.272
Because that's what she said you did.

33:43.297 --> 33:45.424
(scoffs)

33:53.858 --> 33:57.151
<i>(phone ringing)</i>

34:02.674 --> 34:04.454
Detective Wilson.

34:04.479 --> 34:05.862
Hey, Elizabeth, it's Lopez.

34:05.887 --> 34:07.110
Hope I didn't wake you.

34:07.135 --> 34:09.574
Uh, I was just...

34:10.129 --> 34:11.295
What's up?

34:11.320 --> 34:12.953
Listen, Parker and I went

34:12.978 --> 34:14.492
to one of those underground
parties tonight,

34:14.516 --> 34:16.322
and I just thought you should know,

34:16.347 --> 34:18.321
we talked to Carter.

34:19.849 --> 34:21.429
She was there?

34:21.454 --> 34:23.052
Not just there, no, she seemed to be

34:23.077 --> 34:25.074
running the damn thing.

34:28.152 --> 34:30.199
(Grant) Thanks for letting me
spend the night... good pie.

34:30.225 --> 34:32.425
You know we love the pie.

34:35.210 --> 34:37.629
Listen, honey.

34:37.846 --> 34:40.230
I know things are rough at home right now.

34:40.255 --> 34:41.875
And when are they not?

34:41.900 --> 34:43.234
But...

34:43.260 --> 34:44.592
don't be a stoner.

34:44.618 --> 34:46.904
You have to face life sober.

34:46.928 --> 34:49.493
Mostly sober.

34:50.536 --> 34:53.393
I mean, I just miss Carter.

34:53.681 --> 34:56.509
I wish there was something I could do.

34:56.534 --> 34:59.335
There is... call her.

34:59.360 --> 35:00.787
Guilt trip her.

35:00.812 --> 35:03.638
Bribe her, beg her to come home.

35:03.849 --> 35:05.504
You think that'll work?

35:05.529 --> 35:06.946
Well, someone's got to do something,

35:06.971 --> 35:12.116
'cause that girl is definitely
not coming home on her own.

35:15.711 --> 35:18.148
(knocking)

35:22.542 --> 35:24.419
Oh, hey.

35:24.444 --> 35:25.987
Hi, is Carter here?

35:26.013 --> 35:27.508
Come on in.

35:32.379 --> 35:35.339
I'm just gonna...

35:37.401 --> 35:39.017
Hey.

35:39.042 --> 35:40.291
Hey.

35:40.316 --> 35:41.944
What are you doing here?

35:41.969 --> 35:44.764
I wanted to show you these.

35:44.789 --> 35:46.637
What's this?

35:47.038 --> 35:49.252
These are court documents.

35:49.563 --> 35:51.420
A year ago, when I filed for custody,

35:51.445 --> 35:52.978
and I was denied because she fought me

35:53.003 --> 35:54.532
every way she could.

35:54.557 --> 35:56.356
My child support payments,

35:56.381 --> 35:58.270
every month, on time,

35:58.295 --> 36:00.538
for my daughter's entire life.

36:01.764 --> 36:03.438
Jared, I'm really sorry.

36:03.463 --> 36:05.347
I know.

36:05.839 --> 36:07.579
And I know you're scared.

36:07.604 --> 36:09.796
I'm scared, too.

36:10.061 --> 36:12.728
I just want you to trust me.

36:12.753 --> 36:15.275
I do.

36:15.913 --> 36:17.883
I will.

36:17.931 --> 36:20.014
I missed you last night.

36:20.039 --> 36:22.164
I don't sleep well without you.

36:22.189 --> 36:24.203
Yeah, I miss you, too.

36:24.229 --> 36:25.883
Your side of the bed?

36:25.908 --> 36:28.858
Still open, so...

♪ The sun is coming down ♪

36:31.814 --> 36:33.150

Okay, I'm gonna get the
waffles, and you get the eggs,

36:35.062 --> 36:36.411
and then we'll split it, okay?

36:36.436 --> 36:37.696
Whatever you want, babe.

36:37.721 --> 36:39.383
That's what I want.

36:41.227 --> 36:43.760
Look, I'm really, really proud of you.

36:43.792 --> 36:47.212
- I'm gonna e-mail her.
- No, wait a hot second, okay?

36:47.237 --> 36:48.646
You don't want to seem too eager.

36:48.671 --> 36:50.972
I am, though. Babe, just think.

36:50.997 --> 36:52.271
I get some gigs up in New York,

36:52.296 --> 36:53.962
we can get a studio apartment

36:53.987 --> 36:55.022
for the summer.

36:55.047 --> 36:56.598
Party all night, sleep all day.

36:56.623 --> 36:58.706
No, I will be painting during the day,

36:58.731 --> 37:00.298
and then I'll be selling my
paintings on the sidewalk

37:00.323 --> 37:04.011
until a dealer takes notice,
then invites me to have a show.

37:04.037 --> 37:05.166
All while I'm asleep.

37:05.191 --> 37:06.494
How awesome would that be?

37:06.519 --> 37:08.711
Sounds like it.

37:09.613 --> 37:11.118
I love you, baby.

37:11.144 --> 37:13.247
I love you, too.

37:18.415 --> 37:19.757
Whoa.

37:19.782 --> 37:21.252
Maybe we should pull over.

37:21.277 --> 37:24.791
Yeah.

37:28.007 --> 37:29.835
Where are you going?

37:29.874 --> 37:31.630
Oh, um...

37:32.169 --> 37:33.869
to Jared's?

37:33.894 --> 37:35.727
Mm-hmm.

37:35.962 --> 37:37.632
Well, I know you know what you're doing,

37:37.657 --> 37:41.245
but please be careful.

37:41.270 --> 37:42.769
You sound like Elizabeth.

37:42.794 --> 37:44.598
Because we both sound like your mom.

37:44.623 --> 37:46.239
(laughing)

37:46.264 --> 37:48.886
Well, um...

37:48.910 --> 37:51.061
thanks for letting me stay here.

37:51.086 --> 37:53.286
Anytime.

38:00.898 --> 38:02.642
Bye.

38:02.667 --> 38:04.962
Bye.

38:08.654 --> 38:10.101
Special delivery.

38:10.126 --> 38:11.203
Good morning.

38:11.228 --> 38:12.658
Morning.

38:12.683 --> 38:14.216
Hey.

38:14.454 --> 38:16.169
You guys hungry?

38:16.194 --> 38:18.698
No, I... I had pie.

38:19.503 --> 38:20.611
Pie?

38:20.636 --> 38:21.668
Pie for breakfast.

38:21.693 --> 38:23.488
Hey, pie is nutritious.

38:23.853 --> 38:26.210
So you were vague when
you called last night.

38:26.235 --> 38:28.065
What inspired this sleepover?

38:28.090 --> 38:30.768
It's a long, very uninteresting story.

38:30.793 --> 38:32.566
How are you doing?

38:32.751 --> 38:33.917
How am I doing?

38:33.942 --> 38:37.720
Honestly, I'm not sure.

38:39.849 --> 38:41.232
I'm worried.

38:41.257 --> 38:43.364
I think Carter might have gotten herself

38:43.389 --> 38:45.056
into a little bit of trouble.

38:45.081 --> 38:46.697
What kind of trouble?

38:46.722 --> 38:48.216
I'm not sure.

38:48.241 --> 38:49.846
But what if what you said about

38:49.871 --> 38:52.564
letting Carter make her
own mistakes isn't right?

38:52.746 --> 38:55.312
Don't worry about Carter.
Grant's gonna call her.

38:55.337 --> 38:56.914
He's gonna guilt her into coming home.

38:56.939 --> 38:59.000
What happened to your hands-off approach?

38:59.025 --> 39:00.358
I meant your hands.

39:00.383 --> 39:01.682
But someone's got to do something.

39:01.707 --> 39:03.362
I mean, for Christ's sake, the girl's 17.

39:03.387 --> 39:05.554
She's got to come home.

39:07.475 --> 39:10.446
Let's just go look at
the swatches again, okay?

39:10.471 --> 39:13.722
You know, get our minds off this.

39:16.072 --> 39:18.405

40:08.758 --> 40:10.362

40:10.387 --> 40:12.441
Just wanted to make sure you were decent.

40:12.466 --> 40:14.833
Well, what would you have done if I wasn't?

40:14.858 --> 40:18.274
Um... this?

40:21.056 --> 40:23.144
So I cleaned out a drawer for you,

because I just took everything

40:29.112 --> 40:31.817
that was in the drawer and
threw it in the closet.

40:31.842 --> 40:33.193
(laughs)

40:33.218 --> 40:36.641
Okay, well, I will consider myself warned.

40:36.666 --> 40:38.545
Thank you.

(Carter) Next time on "Finding Carter"...

40:58.957 --> 41:00.281
You don't even know this man.

41:00.307 --> 41:01.973
Mom, do you really think I would be

41:01.998 --> 41:03.466
moving in with him if I didn't know him?

41:03.491 --> 41:05.692
I wasn't cool selling before
you forced me to do it...

41:05.717 --> 41:07.103
We got a party tomorrow night.

41:07.127 --> 41:08.883
I'll cut you in, 20%.

41:08.909 --> 41:10.759
I'm driving up to see my mom.

41:10.784 --> 41:13.200
I'm worried he's gonna come
by, try to contact you.

41:13.225 --> 41:14.888
Funny you should mention that.

41:14.913 --> 41:16.151
Hey, son.
