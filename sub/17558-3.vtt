WEBVTT

00:00.968 --> 00:02.370
SHANIA:
This one's my favorite!

00:02.436 --> 00:04.472
BRYAN: If you learn nothing else
in life, just remember

00:04.538 --> 00:05.806
you can never go wrong
with Dolce & Gabbana.

00:05.873 --> 00:07.141
Their baby line is

00:07.208 --> 00:08.709
almost as chic as
their little doggie line.

00:08.776 --> 00:11.912
It's just so exciting to think
there's going to be

00:11.979 --> 00:13.747
a baby in the world
with hopes and dreams

00:13.814 --> 00:16.317
and Swarovski crystals.

00:16.384 --> 00:18.152
Are those baby clothes?

00:18.219 --> 00:20.188
Bryan, we talked about this.

00:20.254 --> 00:21.522
We agreed no buying
any baby things

00:21.589 --> 00:23.524
until after
all the health tests.

00:23.591 --> 00:26.060
I know. I was bad,
but it wasn't planned.

00:26.127 --> 00:28.329
I mean, it just happened.
I got excited.

00:28.396 --> 00:29.663
We were out for Pinkberry.

00:29.730 --> 00:31.665
I mean, obviously,
I'm lactose intolerant

00:31.732 --> 00:33.901
but Shania here
begged me for some.

00:33.967 --> 00:34.902
Anyway, next thing I know,

00:34.968 --> 00:37.205
the kid here spots a baby store
and drags me inside.

00:37.271 --> 00:39.640
It is a whole new
tiny fashion world out there.

00:39.707 --> 00:41.409
I had no idea.

00:42.210 --> 00:44.011
Supermodel, werk!

00:44.078 --> 00:46.380
It's so Gaga.

00:46.947 --> 00:48.116
House of LeBeija!

00:48.182 --> 00:50.718
You look ridiculous.

00:50.784 --> 00:53.053
I mean, that baby model was

00:53.121 --> 00:55.022
a perfect, like,
twelve-eight-twelve.

00:55.089 --> 00:56.424
We agreed:
no buying any baby clothes

00:56.490 --> 00:59.160
until after all the tests.

00:59.227 --> 01:01.829
A mouse driving a car.

01:01.895 --> 01:03.264
It's hilarious.

01:04.132 --> 01:05.266
You are made of stone!

01:05.333 --> 01:07.168
All this stuff
needs to be returned.
Returned?

01:07.235 --> 01:08.769
David, the salesgirl will think
we're poor.

01:08.836 --> 01:10.371
Yeah? Well, you should have
thought of that

01:10.438 --> 01:12.440
before you broke our agreement.

01:14.442 --> 01:15.543
Can I keep this baby skirt?

01:15.609 --> 01:17.511
It's so cute.
Of course. Sure.

01:17.578 --> 01:20.681
Just take it before Eeyore
makes us return everything.

01:20.748 --> 01:24.485
So... this baby is going to be
the greatest thing

01:24.552 --> 01:26.053
that ever happened
to us, right?

01:26.120 --> 01:26.887
Mm-hmm.

01:26.954 --> 01:28.055
It's our little miracle.

01:28.122 --> 01:29.290
Absolutely.

01:29.357 --> 01:30.858
So when can we start
enjoying it?

01:30.924 --> 01:32.426
At about the 12-week mark.

01:32.493 --> 01:33.727
That's when we run the fetal
nuchal translucency test,

01:33.794 --> 01:35.129
or the NT.

01:35.196 --> 01:36.864
FNT. I just say NT. Quicker.

01:36.930 --> 01:39.500
Well, after that,
I can pull the trigger
on his/her canopy bed?

01:39.567 --> 01:41.034
Uh, no, Bryan.
We're not out of the woods yet.

01:41.101 --> 01:42.336
What's the test?

01:42.403 --> 01:44.472
It's basically an ultrasound
that scans for Downs Syndrome.

01:44.538 --> 01:46.307
They also look at the
amniotic fluid

01:46.374 --> 01:47.175
for any other abnormalities

01:47.241 --> 01:48.742
and they measure the baby.

01:48.809 --> 01:50.678
And let's pray that he or she is
just slightly undersized,

01:50.744 --> 01:52.846
'cause those Marc Jacobs
onesies run a tad small.

01:52.913 --> 01:54.982
It'd be a shame
if he or she got shut
out of that fall line.

01:55.048 --> 01:56.284
Yes, that would be a shame.

01:56.350 --> 01:58.152
So after the Marc Jacobs test,
then what?

01:58.219 --> 02:00.154
Well, then we start to...

02:00.221 --> 02:01.255
Well, there are many options.

02:01.322 --> 02:03.391
There's the amnio
at 16 to 20 weeks,

02:03.457 --> 02:05.092
the chorionic villus at 18,
but a lot of people are

02:05.159 --> 02:07.695
doing that earlier now,
but I was thinking

02:07.761 --> 02:09.597
just to be safe,
that we go ahead and schedule

02:09.663 --> 02:11.632
the quadruple marker screener.
What's that?

02:11.699 --> 02:13.133
I don't know.
Why don't you ask him?

02:13.201 --> 02:14.502
Well, it's really
quite amazing.

02:14.568 --> 02:15.669
What they do is
they take a blood sample

02:15.736 --> 02:17.738
and they analyze
various hormones.

02:17.805 --> 02:21.509
The results can detect
upwards of 85% of defects.

02:21.575 --> 02:23.043
Defects? What kind of defects?

02:23.110 --> 02:24.144
I'm shutting down.

02:24.212 --> 02:26.380
Anything from spina bifida
to red hair.

02:26.447 --> 02:28.282
Red hair?
Can we do that test now?

02:28.349 --> 02:29.283
You know, I read online

02:29.350 --> 02:31.185
that Judas was a redhead.

02:31.252 --> 02:32.553
I don't trust
any one of them.

02:32.620 --> 02:34.822
Every time I see Reba McEntire,
I just want to shout,

02:34.888 --> 02:36.290
"You killed my Lord and Savior."

02:36.357 --> 02:37.691
You see a redhead walking
down the street

02:37.758 --> 02:39.993
just go, "Fire in the hole!
Fire in the hole!"

02:40.060 --> 02:41.495
GOLDIE:
Um, I don't think

02:41.562 --> 02:43.030
I did any of these tests
when I was pregnant with Shania.

02:43.096 --> 02:43.964
I mean, my nana
was so ashamed,

02:44.031 --> 02:45.966
for the first three months,
she took me to the veterinarian.

02:46.033 --> 02:47.801
BRYAN:
So, it's after all this:

02:47.868 --> 02:49.703
it's the Marc Jacobs test, the
amnio, the birth defect thing,

02:49.770 --> 02:51.104
the Red Head Scare, and then
we can have the joy?

02:51.171 --> 02:53.040
Yes. Then we can have the joy.

02:53.106 --> 02:54.608
GARY: It's a lot
to deal with, I know,

02:54.675 --> 02:56.143
but really, all you need
to focus on now

02:56.210 --> 02:57.945
is the ultrasound this Friday.

02:58.011 --> 02:59.880
It's a big day.
You're going to hear
your baby's heartbeat!

02:59.947 --> 03:01.215
Of course, just because
you hear the heartbeat

03:01.282 --> 03:02.516
doesn't mean that you're safe.

03:02.583 --> 03:05.085
Nearly 25% of all pregnancies
end in miscarriage.

03:05.152 --> 03:06.119
Butterscotch?

03:06.186 --> 03:07.388
Yeah. Why not?

03:13.026 --> 03:17.265
(girls whispering)

03:17.331 --> 03:19.267
Hey. Can I sit
with you guys at lunch?

03:19.333 --> 03:20.601
No. You're hideous.

03:20.668 --> 03:23.103
Wait, is that
for a baby or something?

03:23.170 --> 03:25.205
What? Uh, no.
It's a crop top,

03:25.273 --> 03:26.507
like teenagers wear

03:26.574 --> 03:29.176
and certain women
my dad hangs out with.

03:29.243 --> 03:31.178
Then why is there
a pacifier on it?

03:31.245 --> 03:33.847
(laughing)

03:33.914 --> 03:34.915
Hey, Shauna.

03:34.982 --> 03:36.284
You want to sit next to me?

03:36.350 --> 03:40.087
Thanks. It's Shania.

03:40.153 --> 03:41.489
My mom's boyfriend
packed my lunch today.

03:41.555 --> 03:43.424
He always gives me
leftover pizza.

03:43.491 --> 03:44.725
If you sit with me,

03:44.792 --> 03:46.226
you can eat my crusts.

03:46.294 --> 03:47.728
You want me to
eat lunch with you?

03:47.795 --> 03:48.629
Is this a prank?

03:48.696 --> 03:50.298
'Cause no one here
is nice to me.

03:50.364 --> 03:51.899
Why are you being nice to me?

03:51.965 --> 03:53.434
I like your top.

03:55.269 --> 03:56.837
I really like it.

03:58.839 --> 04:00.441
I really wouldn't worry.

04:00.508 --> 04:02.142
Only four percent
of the world's population

04:02.209 --> 04:03.377
has red hair.
I know.

04:03.444 --> 04:05.513
I just never considered
the possibility.

04:05.579 --> 04:07.915
See you on "Heartbeat Friday."
Bump! Bump!

04:07.981 --> 04:09.817
Oh, Bryan! Shania said
some top you gave her

04:09.883 --> 04:12.019
was so cool, it helped
her make a new friend.

04:12.085 --> 04:13.654
Aww.
Aww.

04:13.721 --> 04:14.922
You know what? I'm going to buy
her some more new clothes.

04:14.988 --> 04:17.291
You guys have fun at lunch.
I'm hitting the outlet mall.

04:17.358 --> 04:20.160
If I had ever been to one,
I would love an outlet mall.
I'll drive.

04:20.227 --> 04:21.829
Oh, no, it's far.
I'll just take the bus.

04:21.895 --> 04:23.631
No, we can give you a ride.
What's wrong with the bus?

04:23.697 --> 04:24.832
Honey, the only people
that take the bus are

04:24.898 --> 04:27.301
high school dropouts,
single moms and bottle blondes.

04:27.368 --> 04:29.102
You literally just described me.

04:29.169 --> 04:31.639
Oh, we can fix your hair.

04:31.705 --> 04:33.807
Okay, David, I need your help.

04:33.874 --> 04:35.543
If you were
a nine-year-old girl,

04:35.609 --> 04:37.711
would you
think this is cool?

04:37.778 --> 04:39.580
Hmm, I would say "cool,"
but probably fatal.

04:39.647 --> 04:41.214
Okay.
I'm just saying

04:41.281 --> 04:42.816
Shania is very fair-skinned,

04:42.883 --> 04:45.419
and tank tops like that
expose shoulders

04:45.486 --> 04:47.555
which is the area most commonly
neglected by sunscreen

04:47.621 --> 04:49.657
and can cause
irreparable damages.

04:49.723 --> 04:50.858
But you know,
just keep an eye out

04:50.924 --> 04:52.960
for any irregular,
notched or scalloped moles.

04:53.026 --> 04:54.261
But super-cute color.

04:54.328 --> 04:56.430
Where's Bryan?
Mm...

04:56.497 --> 04:58.298
I'll check by the scarves,
you check by the mirrors.

04:58.366 --> 04:59.767
Okay.

05:05.138 --> 05:06.974
* Busted. *

05:07.040 --> 05:08.576
Are these baby clothes?

05:08.642 --> 05:11.078
I'm confused as to why
the prices are so low.

05:11.144 --> 05:12.913
Where am I?

05:12.980 --> 05:14.448
Stop it.

05:14.515 --> 05:16.283
You promised we'd wait
till after the test results.

05:16.350 --> 05:18.085
I know.

05:18.151 --> 05:19.286
But when I promised that,

05:19.353 --> 05:21.088
I didn't know
that this existed.

05:21.154 --> 05:22.490
That's not that cute.

05:25.459 --> 05:26.694
Okay, that's adorable.

05:26.760 --> 05:28.328
Can you believe
we're going to have a baby

05:28.396 --> 05:30.398
with a head that wears
one of these?

05:30.464 --> 05:33.200
I know. We're really
gonna be dads.

05:33.266 --> 05:35.002
I love you, too.

05:35.068 --> 05:37.304
I didn't say I love you.

05:37.371 --> 05:39.907
I know, but I know
you were thinking it.

05:39.973 --> 05:40.974
I love you, too.

05:41.041 --> 05:42.209
Wow.

05:42.275 --> 05:45.312
Excuse me?
Would you mind not doing that?

05:45.379 --> 05:47.748
No, it's okay. He's actually
going to let me buy this thing.

05:47.815 --> 05:51.284
No. Uh, don't do that
in front of my daughter.

05:51.351 --> 05:52.285
Kissing another man.

05:52.352 --> 05:53.421
This is a family store,

05:53.487 --> 05:55.022
and I shouldn't
have to go home

05:55.088 --> 05:56.256
and explain that to my kid.

05:56.323 --> 05:57.357
Explain what?

05:57.425 --> 05:58.492
Look, I don't care what kind
of crap you do

05:58.559 --> 05:59.660
in the privacy of your own home,

05:59.727 --> 06:01.061
but don't bring it in here.

06:01.128 --> 06:02.596
No, no, no. Let's just go.
It's not worth it.
No, no, no, no, no.

06:02.663 --> 06:05.065
Explain what, sir? Love?

06:05.132 --> 06:07.300
There are places you'd get your
ass kicked for that crap.

06:07.367 --> 06:08.736
I'm trying to be cool here.

06:08.802 --> 06:11.371
Oh, well, you really are
being cool, sir.

06:11.439 --> 06:14.207
Thanks for your intolerance
and your bigotry,

06:14.274 --> 06:16.910
and for fostering this ignorance
in another generation.

06:16.977 --> 06:18.746
And for bringing back
the fanny pack.

06:20.681 --> 06:22.149
Okay, the impact of that line
fell short

06:22.215 --> 06:24.952
because you're still wearing
a beanie on your head.

06:25.018 --> 06:26.687
I'm trying to protect
my family here.

06:26.754 --> 06:28.088
Yeah, well, we're having
a family, too.

06:28.155 --> 06:29.389
Well, that's disgusting.

06:29.457 --> 06:31.859
I feel bad for
that poor kid.

06:31.925 --> 06:33.494
Come on.

06:36.029 --> 06:36.897
Oh, there you are.

06:36.964 --> 06:39.500
Are you guys all right?
What happened?

06:50.277 --> 06:51.745
Hello! Hablo English?

06:51.812 --> 06:54.114
I'm here to pick up my
granddaughter.

06:54.181 --> 06:55.082
Name?

06:55.148 --> 06:57.150
Mrs. Jane Forrest.

06:57.217 --> 06:58.418
The girl.

06:58.486 --> 07:00.521
Oh. Shania Clemmons. Four-eyes.

07:00.588 --> 07:03.657
Cloakroom. With a classmate.
Oh, that's nice.

07:03.724 --> 07:05.993
I've never met
any of Shania's friends.

07:06.059 --> 07:06.927
I was starting to think

07:06.994 --> 07:09.429
she killed, breaded
and ate them all.

07:12.566 --> 07:14.434
What the hell are you wearing?!

07:14.502 --> 07:15.869
Hey, Nana!

07:15.936 --> 07:17.471
And what the hell
are you doing?!

07:17.538 --> 07:18.706
Rounding second.

07:18.772 --> 07:22.442
Okay, both of you,
come with me-- right now.

07:25.546 --> 07:27.648
Hey, dude, whatcha doing?

07:29.149 --> 07:31.418
Please tell me you're not upset
about returning

07:31.485 --> 07:32.520
the baby clothes.
I'm not.

07:32.586 --> 07:34.221
Once we're out of the woods,

07:34.287 --> 07:37.224
I promise you can buy as many
tiny pairs of baby shoes

07:37.290 --> 07:39.660
as you want.

07:39.727 --> 07:42.395
Our kid is going to give Terry
Bradshaw a case of shoe envy.

07:42.462 --> 07:44.331
It is Carrie Bradshaw!

07:44.397 --> 07:45.599
And stop pretending
you don't know!

07:45.666 --> 07:47.034
And that's not why I'm upset.

07:47.100 --> 07:48.669
You're not still thinking
about the guy

07:48.736 --> 07:50.303
from the outlet mall, are you?

07:50.370 --> 07:52.005
That was
an isolated incident.

07:52.072 --> 07:54.407
Honey... it's okay.

07:54.474 --> 07:55.909
It's not okay.

07:55.976 --> 07:57.678
There will always be
stupid jerks in the world.

07:57.745 --> 07:59.146
You can't let them
bother you.

07:59.212 --> 08:00.514
Just ignore them.

08:00.581 --> 08:01.915
That's your plan?

08:01.982 --> 08:03.316
Ignore them?

08:03.383 --> 08:05.986
I've been ignoring people like
that my entire life, David.

08:06.053 --> 08:07.688
That's not good enough anymore.
We're having a baby.

08:07.755 --> 08:10.824
Yes, God willing, everything's
chromosomally correct...
Will you stop that?!

08:10.891 --> 08:12.860
We are bringing a
baby into the world

08:12.926 --> 08:15.362
where idiot people feel
free to say and do

08:15.428 --> 08:16.630
the things they say and do

08:16.697 --> 08:18.866
because we have been
trained to ignore them!

08:18.932 --> 08:20.033
That guy is not the problem.

08:20.100 --> 08:20.934
We are the problem.

08:21.001 --> 08:22.002
Well, what did you
want me to do?

08:22.069 --> 08:23.336
Get in his face?
I'm not that guy.

08:23.403 --> 08:24.204
I don't know!

08:27.474 --> 08:29.342
I'm not crying for me.

08:29.409 --> 08:31.712
I'm crying because what if that
happened in front of our kid?

08:31.779 --> 08:33.213
What will we do then?

08:33.280 --> 08:35.115
Just be ashamed of who we are?

08:35.182 --> 08:37.918
What kind of message does
that send to our child?

08:37.985 --> 08:41.689
I don't want our kid
to feel that.

08:41.755 --> 08:43.757
To see him or her
get hurt like that,

08:43.824 --> 08:45.959
that would just kill me.

08:46.026 --> 08:48.729
As a parent, you're supposed
to protect your child.

08:48.796 --> 08:50.430
You tell them
not to play in the street,

08:50.497 --> 08:51.799
and-and don't do drugs

08:51.865 --> 08:54.702
and wear a thick shea butter
moisturizer at night.

08:54.768 --> 08:57.738
But how are we supposed to
protect our baby from hate?

09:01.208 --> 09:02.876
(bell dings)

09:02.943 --> 09:03.944
Excuse me,

09:04.011 --> 09:05.813
what is the best method
of birth control nowadays?

09:05.879 --> 09:07.380
Ma'am, isn't your age

09:07.447 --> 09:09.049
the best method
of birth control?

09:09.116 --> 09:10.618
No, it's not for me,

09:10.684 --> 09:12.920
you inked-up, rude pervert.

09:12.986 --> 09:14.588
It's for them.

09:14.655 --> 09:15.723
(chuckling):
Uh, I'm sorry?

09:15.789 --> 09:17.524
Why don't you just give me

09:17.591 --> 09:19.492
the pill for her,
and I'm gonna need

09:19.559 --> 09:20.794
some condoms for the boy.

09:20.861 --> 09:22.562
I'd say, extra small.

09:22.630 --> 09:24.431
Are you serious?
These are just kids.

09:24.497 --> 09:26.033
Oh, they may look like kids,

09:26.099 --> 09:28.702
but their private parts
have already gotten into

09:28.769 --> 09:31.038
some very adult conversations.

09:31.104 --> 09:32.239
Look at her chest.

09:32.305 --> 09:36.309
These tiny boobies are
already starting to sprout

09:36.376 --> 09:39.179
and for all I know,
Auntie Flo's come to visit.

09:39.246 --> 09:41.481
She's so secretive.
She's just like her mother.

09:41.548 --> 09:42.883
SHANIA:
In my mind,

09:42.950 --> 09:44.017
I'm taking a bubble bath

09:44.084 --> 09:46.119
and someone just threw
a toaster in next to me.

09:46.186 --> 09:47.855
I feel so relieved.

09:47.921 --> 09:51.091
Budding breasts.
I hadn't noticed that.

09:51.158 --> 09:52.192
Oh, I have!

09:52.259 --> 09:54.427
And that is all it takes.

09:54.494 --> 09:58.165
I'm going to call the police.

09:58.231 --> 10:00.934
What fruit is in
the Mango-Banana Blast?

10:01.001 --> 10:02.269
Amir, I'm completely
freaking out.

10:02.335 --> 10:03.503
Bryan and I are going
to hear the heartbeat

10:03.570 --> 10:04.437
for the first time today.

10:04.504 --> 10:05.939
Is the Lemon Bang sour?

10:06.006 --> 10:07.574
What, are you nuts?
Why are you even
telling me this?

10:07.641 --> 10:09.142
You still have
the first heartbeat.

10:09.209 --> 10:11.611
You still have the CVS
and the triple screen.

10:11.679 --> 10:13.280
All sorts of bad things
can come up.

10:13.346 --> 10:14.815
I know. Can't you just say
you're happy for us?

10:14.882 --> 10:16.249
Is there meat in
the protein boost?
(groaning)

10:16.316 --> 10:17.417
Come on!

10:17.484 --> 10:18.919
Dude, biggest fight
me and the wife

10:18.986 --> 10:21.321
ever got in was during my
son's first heartbeat test.

10:21.388 --> 10:22.723
I was all over the monitor

10:22.790 --> 10:24.391
comparing fetal heart rate
against hers...

10:24.457 --> 10:25.693
What does immune boost mean?

10:25.759 --> 10:27.160
You frickin' kidding me?
Come on!

10:27.227 --> 10:29.429
See, it turns out,
she was just upset

10:29.496 --> 10:31.031
because I was thinking
like a doctor

10:31.098 --> 10:32.532
and not like a man
hearing his son's heartbeat

10:32.599 --> 10:33.633
for the first time.

10:33.701 --> 10:35.268
I think I'm having
an anxiety attack.

10:35.335 --> 10:36.436
AMIR:
Hey, look at me.

10:36.503 --> 10:37.370
What?
Hey.

10:37.437 --> 10:39.740
Congrats, David.

10:39.807 --> 10:41.074
Can I have a femme boost,
please?

10:41.141 --> 10:43.076
Will you give the idiot
an IQ boost already?

10:43.143 --> 10:45.078
This retard's
holding up the line!

10:45.145 --> 10:47.715
Hey, don't talk
to him like that!
Oh, yeah?

10:47.781 --> 10:49.983
What are you
gonna do about it?

10:51.719 --> 10:53.086
(grunts)

10:53.153 --> 10:55.022
Hey!

10:55.088 --> 10:56.623
I don't need you fighting
my battles for me...

10:56.690 --> 10:58.826
fag.

11:01.328 --> 11:04.164
Sorry I'm late, guys.
That's okay. The doctor's
not even here yet.

11:04.231 --> 11:05.232
Oh, yeah.

11:05.298 --> 11:06.299
Are you okay?

11:06.366 --> 11:07.300
Uh, no, I'm upset

11:07.367 --> 11:09.636
that I-I just punched someone
at the gym.

11:09.703 --> 11:11.104
For hogging the free weights?

11:11.171 --> 11:12.906
I mean, David, I don't condone
that, but I-I do understand.

11:12.973 --> 11:14.742
No, I punched a guy who called

11:14.808 --> 11:15.776
a handicapable person
the R word.

11:15.843 --> 11:17.477
That's horrible.

11:17.544 --> 11:19.546
And then the retarded guy called
me a fag. Can you believe that?

11:19.612 --> 11:22.783
Oh, well, is-is the guy you
hit going to press charges?

11:22.850 --> 11:25.919
I don't know.
I'm just... I'm just upset.

11:25.986 --> 11:28.221
Largely at myself.
I just lost it.

11:28.288 --> 11:30.157
It doesn't matter.
Where's the chart?

11:30.223 --> 11:31.124
Look at the chart.

11:31.191 --> 11:32.559
Oh, no. David, are you okay?
I'm fine.

11:32.625 --> 11:34.061
I knew.

11:34.127 --> 11:36.229
You knew what?

11:36.296 --> 11:37.397
At the outlet store,

11:37.464 --> 11:39.800
I pretended I didn't hear
when that guy said

11:39.867 --> 11:41.368
you were disgusting
for being gay parents,

11:41.434 --> 11:43.436
but I did hear.

11:43.503 --> 11:45.973
You really are
being cool, sir.

11:46.039 --> 11:47.741
Thank you for
your intolerance,

11:47.808 --> 11:49.142
and your bigotry,

11:49.209 --> 11:51.879
and for fostering this
ignorance in another generation.

11:51.945 --> 11:54.281
And for bringing
back the fanny pack.

11:54.347 --> 11:56.884
I should have marched up
and confronted them,

11:56.950 --> 11:58.118
but I was too afraid.

11:58.185 --> 12:01.154
It's okay.
No, it's not okay.

12:01.221 --> 12:03.757
And the next time that happens,
I promise I'll speak up.

12:03.824 --> 12:04.958
If only these ignorant people

12:05.025 --> 12:06.526
with all this hate
in their hearts

12:06.593 --> 12:07.694
could see you like I do.

12:07.761 --> 12:08.996
Did you just intentionally

12:09.062 --> 12:11.098
quote a song from Cabaret
to lift my spirits,

12:11.164 --> 12:12.532
or was that
a well-timed accident?

12:12.599 --> 12:15.035
(laughter)

12:15.102 --> 12:17.337
Everybody ready?
Yes.

12:17.404 --> 12:20.040
All right, it's gonna
be very simple.

12:20.107 --> 12:21.842
It'll be over in a minute.

12:24.577 --> 12:28.415
Just so you know, 45% of all
of these tests turn out...
Yes.

12:28.481 --> 12:29.950
Here we go.
Ooh. Yup.

12:30.017 --> 12:32.452
Okay, there we are.

12:34.021 --> 12:36.189
We have a heartbeat.

12:37.290 --> 12:38.625
Congratulations.

12:38.691 --> 12:40.828
(laughter)

12:43.831 --> 12:46.834
(cries)

12:59.112 --> 13:00.780
Thank you for coming.

13:02.983 --> 13:04.617
I... have to apologize.

13:04.684 --> 13:06.019
I never should have allowed
this woman

13:06.086 --> 13:08.188
to remove these children
from my classroom.

13:08.255 --> 13:10.223
Excuse me?
When I found them,

13:10.290 --> 13:12.525
these children were
about to fornicate

13:12.592 --> 13:13.827
in a coat closet.

13:13.894 --> 13:15.062
Looked like
a fourth grade

13:15.128 --> 13:17.264
production of Caligula
back there.

13:17.330 --> 13:19.632
Nana, that's no excuse
for kidnapping an actual kid

13:19.699 --> 13:21.568
and dragging him
to Planned Parenthood.

13:21.634 --> 13:22.735
Okay, this little horn dog

13:22.802 --> 13:24.237
was going at Shania
like a kid

13:24.304 --> 13:25.973
who lost a quarter
in a candy machine.

13:26.039 --> 13:27.107
And who can blame him?

13:27.174 --> 13:29.109
He can't control himself.

13:29.176 --> 13:31.845
You've got poor little
Shania tarted up like

13:31.912 --> 13:33.780
some CNN news anchor.

13:33.847 --> 13:34.882
Come on.
It was completely innocent.

13:34.948 --> 13:36.616
(sighs)
I'm so sorry.

13:36.683 --> 13:37.918
This is not the first time

13:37.985 --> 13:39.719
my nana's abducted a
person to make a point.

13:39.786 --> 13:41.288
I'm actually
really glad she did it.

13:41.354 --> 13:42.923
Yeah. I'm sorry?

13:42.990 --> 13:44.791
Kids grow up so fast.

13:44.858 --> 13:46.393
You know, everywhere
they look, it's just

13:46.459 --> 13:47.494
sex, sex, sex.

13:47.560 --> 13:49.762
After the stunt
your nana pulled yesterday,

13:49.829 --> 13:52.499
Wilbur and I were able to sit
down and have a very honest

13:52.565 --> 13:55.402
conversation, and I was able
to answer all of his questions.

13:55.468 --> 13:57.037
Uh, well, maybe not all
of his questions.

13:57.104 --> 13:58.538
I still can't tell him

13:58.605 --> 14:01.508
who his father is
'cause I don't know myself.

14:01.574 --> 14:02.475
(Wilbur's mom laughs)

14:02.542 --> 14:03.710
Anyway, thank you.

14:03.776 --> 14:04.577
You're welcome.

14:07.080 --> 14:08.015
Now, may we be excused?

14:08.081 --> 14:09.950
God, I hope so.

14:12.419 --> 14:13.320
(sucking air)

14:13.386 --> 14:17.557
I really like the way you took
control of that situation.

14:17.624 --> 14:18.491
WILBUR'S MOM:
Okay, come on.

14:18.558 --> 14:19.626
All this

14:19.692 --> 14:21.394
is going in my spank bank.

14:25.298 --> 14:26.799
MAN (over P.A.):
Attention students.

14:26.866 --> 14:28.535
Buses 54, 78...

14:28.601 --> 14:30.703
That's right. I think
we got it straight.

14:30.770 --> 14:34.807
Shania, sweetheart, would you
mind waiting in the car?

14:34.874 --> 14:36.343
I-I need to talk to your mom.

14:36.409 --> 14:39.479
Really? Now? Now
I should wait in the car?

14:39.546 --> 14:41.414
Go on, sweetie.

14:42.382 --> 14:45.085
Well, I think we
dodged a bullet there.

14:45.152 --> 14:48.088
Goldie, sweetheart,
we didn't dodge anything.

14:48.155 --> 14:50.723
Your daughter is about
to wade into the deep end

14:50.790 --> 14:53.693
of the sexual pool, and
she does not know how to swim.

14:53.760 --> 14:56.663
We-we shouldn't even be
talking about... swimming.

14:56.729 --> 14:58.365
My daughter is nine.

14:58.431 --> 14:59.899
Oh, yeah?

14:59.967 --> 15:01.368
That's what I thought about you.

15:01.434 --> 15:03.971
And your mother,
and myself while I'm at it.

15:04.037 --> 15:07.140
I was a 34-year-old grandmother.

15:07.207 --> 15:08.141
Now how would you like
to add that

15:08.208 --> 15:09.709
to your list of accomplishments?

15:09.776 --> 15:11.744
Which, by the way, aren't many.

15:11.811 --> 15:14.847
Goldie, this is
our wake-up call.

15:14.914 --> 15:17.317
This is our chance
to do better for Shania.

15:17.384 --> 15:20.653
This is our chance
to stop this cycle.

15:20.720 --> 15:22.889
You're right.

15:22.956 --> 15:24.524
I'll talk to her tonight.

15:24.591 --> 15:25.758
Good.

15:25.825 --> 15:27.327
Now let's get the hell
out of here.

15:27.394 --> 15:29.662
That kid is giving me
the creeps.

15:31.064 --> 15:34.567
Wilbur! Come on. Now!

15:34.634 --> 15:36.569
Well, good news.

15:36.636 --> 15:38.838
Jason here has agreed
not to press charges.

15:38.905 --> 15:40.307
I did two tours in Iraq.

15:40.373 --> 15:42.109
Bit the hump off a camel
on a dare.

15:42.175 --> 15:44.177
You think I can't take a punch
from some punk-ass doctor?

15:44.244 --> 15:46.079
Technically,
I'm not an ass doctor.

15:46.146 --> 15:48.848
I deal more with the
front side, but, uh,

15:48.915 --> 15:50.150
thank you for being
so cool about this.

15:50.217 --> 15:51.251
I don't know
what got into me.

15:51.318 --> 15:52.986
It's probably
just stress.

15:53.053 --> 15:55.622
My boyfriend and I are about to
become dads for the first time.

15:55.688 --> 15:57.824
Aw! Congratulations!

15:57.890 --> 15:59.192
My boyfriend
and I just got engaged.

15:59.259 --> 16:01.461
You? I didn't...
That's great.

16:01.528 --> 16:02.629
Congratulations.
Yeah, I'm so excited.

16:02.695 --> 16:03.963
Get a room!

16:04.031 --> 16:05.198
Can we get

16:05.265 --> 16:06.899
this boy dance party over with?

16:06.966 --> 16:08.368
Well, Jason, David,

16:08.435 --> 16:11.371
we at Equinox do not
tolerate physical violence.

16:11.438 --> 16:12.539
Except in our Krav Maga class.

16:12.605 --> 16:15.008
We're going to have to
revoke your memberships.

16:15.075 --> 16:15.708
Permanently.

16:15.775 --> 16:16.709
Boo-ya!

16:16.776 --> 16:17.444
Boo-ya?

16:17.510 --> 16:18.378
What is that?

16:18.445 --> 16:19.946
You're getting
kicked out, too!

16:20.013 --> 16:21.681
He is getting
kicked out, right?
No.

16:21.748 --> 16:23.750
He called him a fag.
That is not acceptable.

16:23.816 --> 16:25.152
But I didn't use my hands.

16:25.218 --> 16:26.586
I wish there was
something I could do.

16:26.653 --> 16:30.257
Unfortunately, there isn't
a company policy about this.

16:30.323 --> 16:31.924
I'm out of here.
I have a Zumba class

16:31.991 --> 16:32.759
in five minutes.

16:56.883 --> 16:59.152
Would you like to hear

16:59.219 --> 17:00.920
your three
favorite words?

17:00.987 --> 17:02.255
I love you?

17:02.322 --> 17:04.891
Nope, not those. These.

17:04.957 --> 17:07.494
You were r...

17:07.560 --> 17:08.928
You were right.

17:08.995 --> 17:11.431
I need to learn
to let joy in my life.

17:11.498 --> 17:15.868
All the negative stuff,
the fear-- it's all I know.

17:15.935 --> 17:18.138
Like, in med school,
they teach you

17:18.205 --> 17:20.207
to only look for
the bad parts in things.

17:20.273 --> 17:21.141
The exceptions,
not the rules.

17:21.208 --> 17:22.575
Get back to the part
where I'm right.

17:35.322 --> 17:36.289
(sighs)
Why now?

17:36.356 --> 17:38.525
We don't have all
the test results back.

17:38.591 --> 17:39.892
That's just it.

17:39.959 --> 17:41.194
We'll never be out of the woods.

17:41.261 --> 17:42.462
There will always be something.

17:42.529 --> 17:45.865
I hate that all the tough stuff
a kid faces in life

17:45.932 --> 17:47.967
will be even tougher
for our kid

17:48.034 --> 17:50.570
because he or she
will have two dads.

17:50.637 --> 17:53.273
So, even though

17:53.340 --> 17:54.507
it's not going to be easy,

17:54.574 --> 17:58.345
I need to try to
celebrate the wins.

17:58.411 --> 18:01.214
Like, when we heard that
heartbeat yesterday,

18:01.281 --> 18:03.683
I don't think I have
ever loved you more,

18:03.750 --> 18:05.352
because that...

18:05.418 --> 18:08.788
that was the sound
of our family.

18:14.727 --> 18:17.130
Just so you know,

18:17.197 --> 18:19.566
the guy whose ass
I kicked at Equinox

18:19.632 --> 18:21.701
was practically the
size of a lumberjack.

18:21.768 --> 18:23.170
(laughs)

18:23.236 --> 18:25.705
I can't believe
you got banned for life.

18:25.772 --> 18:26.906
I know, right?

18:26.973 --> 18:28.074
That's kind of hot.
Mm.

18:28.141 --> 18:29.642
Just please don't
let yourself go.

18:29.709 --> 18:31.043
(doorbell rings)

18:31.110 --> 18:33.580
DAVID:
Hey.

18:33.646 --> 18:35.948
Hey, Goldie.
What are you guys doing here?

18:36.015 --> 18:37.517
Is everything okay?
GOLDIE:
Yeah. I hope you guys

18:37.584 --> 18:39.118
don't mind us
stopping by.

18:39.186 --> 18:40.253
Of course, anytime.
Come on in.

18:40.320 --> 18:41.688
Don't break out
the crystal.

18:41.754 --> 18:43.823
We're not staying long enough
to catch anything.

18:43.890 --> 18:46.293
Lovely.

18:46.359 --> 18:49.362
Shania has something that
she wants to speak to you about,

18:49.429 --> 18:51.898
and I wanted to be here
to hear it.

18:51.964 --> 18:52.599
GOLDIE:
Go ahead, honey.

18:52.665 --> 18:54.267
Say it.

18:54.334 --> 18:57.237
I have to give you back
the baby clothes.

18:57.304 --> 18:58.338
We agreed it's
a little too...

18:58.405 --> 19:00.340
What was the word you
wanted me to use again?

19:00.407 --> 19:01.608
Mature.
Whoreish.

19:01.674 --> 19:02.875
SHANIA:
Yeah.

19:02.942 --> 19:04.911
Too mature for someone my age
to wear to school.

19:04.977 --> 19:06.045
But thanks, anyway.

19:06.112 --> 19:07.514
BRYAN: Oh, well,
you're very welcome,

19:07.580 --> 19:09.516
young lady, but I'm sorry if
it caused you a little trouble.

19:09.582 --> 19:12.118
It also got me my
first heartbreak.

19:12.185 --> 19:13.586
I'll look back on it later

19:13.653 --> 19:16.155
in life and blog about it
with bittersweet melancholy.

19:16.223 --> 19:17.457
(laughs)

19:17.524 --> 19:20.593
Uh, Nana has a gift for you.

19:20.660 --> 19:21.661
What?

19:21.728 --> 19:22.895
It just baby clothes.

19:24.364 --> 19:26.366
I love buying baby clothes.

19:26.433 --> 19:28.401
I've had a lot of practice.

19:28.468 --> 19:30.970
With Shania and Goldie
and Goldie's mom.

19:31.037 --> 19:33.640
And now your little abomination.

19:33.706 --> 19:35.742
Huh.

19:35.808 --> 19:37.944
Oh, that's a surprise.

19:38.010 --> 19:41.348
Oh... Oh!

19:41.414 --> 19:43.650
"Please help me!"

19:43.716 --> 19:46.786
I actually wanted it to say,
"Please help me.

19:46.853 --> 19:48.120
Call Child
Protective Services," but...

19:48.187 --> 19:50.957
Anywho, um, we're off to see
who Nana can offend at dinner.

19:51.023 --> 19:52.425
Have a great night. Come on.

19:54.126 --> 19:56.062
Uh... Yeah.

19:56.128 --> 19:57.764
BRYAN:
Stay.

19:57.830 --> 19:59.999
Yeah. We ordered way
too much Chinese food.

20:00.066 --> 20:02.168
Come on, there's
plenty for everyone.

20:02.235 --> 20:03.703
Come on.
GOLDIE:
Great.

20:05.805 --> 20:08.408
You know, if you boys

20:08.475 --> 20:10.643
wanted a baby so badly, why
didn't you just order up

20:10.710 --> 20:12.812
one of those pretty
little unwanted

20:12.879 --> 20:14.647
Chinese girls for delivery?

20:14.714 --> 20:17.317
BRYAN & JANE:
With six you get egg roll.

20:28.628 --> 20:31.063
I imagine you gays have wine?

20:31.130 --> 20:32.899
Barrels full.

20:32.965 --> 20:36.269
God forgive me.

20:36.336 --> 20:39.105
Have a seat, Mrs. Forrest.

20:39.171 --> 20:40.239
What do you want
to drink?
Um...

20:40.307 --> 20:41.173
What do you want?

20:41.240 --> 20:43.042
Can I please get some milk
in a wine glass?

20:43.109 --> 20:45.312
Done.
