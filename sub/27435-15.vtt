Hello, Chief Walker.
Sorry to interrupt
your meal...

00:55.850 --> 00:56.942
Who the hell are you?

00:56.990 --> 00:58.844
Who I am is immaterial.

00:58.890 --> 01:01.358
What matters
is that I know you.

01:01.390 --> 01:03.529
I know, for example,
you're the top cop

01:03.560 --> 01:06.529
in a city consumed
by an opioid epidemic.

01:06.560 --> 01:09.393

you're doing...

01:15.400 --> 01:18.164
...you and a cadre
of corrupt underlings.

01:18.210 --> 01:20.235
I've provided a sample
of the kind of proof

01:20.280 --> 01:22.248
that my team
has gathered.

01:22.280 --> 01:24.009

by the Tuerto Organization.

01:44.300 --> 01:46.768
You report to them now.
The Saleris are done.

You can arrest them
or kill them,

Now he works
for a more powerful one.

is the woman

She helps
one criminal organization

04:33.140 --> 04:34.437
take over another?

04:34.470 --> 04:36.438
She helps them expand.

04:36.470 --> 04:38.506
By identifying targets.

04:38.540 --> 04:41.532
Organizations vulnerable
to hostile takeovers,

can be leveraged,

04:45.310 --> 04:46.516
or, in this case,

04:46.550 --> 04:49.519
a cop who's susceptible
to persuasion.

Are you siccing us
on a criminal
or a corporate raider?

04:52.960 --> 04:59.422
(CHUCKLES) Corporate CEOs
are slavishly beholden
to quarterly earnings,

04:59.460 --> 05:04.090
often sacrificing
long-term strategy
for short-term gain.

05:04.130 --> 05:07.566
Well, CEOs
of criminal enterprises

05:07.600 --> 05:10.933
may not have Wall Street
analysts to answer to,

05:10.970 --> 05:13.700
but they're still
under the gun
to increase profits,

05:13.740 --> 05:15.537
because if they don't,
they're not given

05:15.580 --> 05:19.448
a golden parachute and exiled
to a mansion in the Hamptons,

05:19.480 --> 05:20.913
they're killed.

05:20.950 --> 05:23.714
So pointing them
to greener pastures

05:23.750 --> 05:25.718
is a very
lucrative business,

05:25.750 --> 05:29.925
and no one is better at it
than Olivia Olson.

05:29.960 --> 05:32.087
Why are you telling me
all this?

05:32.130 --> 05:33.791
You're usually
annoyingly guarded

05:33.830 --> 05:35.457
about your true motive
for giving us a case.

05:35.500 --> 05:38.663
Why are you admitting
that you're giving us
this criminal to expand?

05:38.700 --> 05:40.258
Because it's a win-win.

05:40.300 --> 05:42.336
I get
to expand my reach,

05:42.370 --> 05:46.579
and you get to know more
about what Anna McMahon
has been up to.

05:46.610 --> 05:49.238
Are you telling me Olson
has intel on Anna McMahon?

05:49.280 --> 05:51.498
As I said,
it's a win-win.

05:51.550 --> 05:53.814
Reddington wants
the Task Force to go
after a Blacklister

05:53.850 --> 05:55.317
who works
with Anna McMahon

05:55.350 --> 05:57.580
when Anna McMahon
is overseeing
the Task Force.

05:57.620 --> 05:59.178
I know. It's tricky.

05:59.220 --> 06:01.518
The tricky part is knowing
if we're getting played.

06:01.560 --> 06:03.585
Figuring out
if this Olson woman
is involved

06:03.630 --> 06:05.655
in McMahon's plot
against this country,

06:05.690 --> 06:08.659
or whether Reddington
just said that

06:08.700 --> 06:10.861
so we'd have incentive
to take out his competition.

06:10.900 --> 06:12.538
It's incentive enough
for me.

06:12.570 --> 06:15.038
We are nowhere on figuring out
what McMahon is doing.

06:15.070 --> 06:17.209
She's a top-level
justice department official

06:17.240 --> 06:18.662
who has the ear
of the President

06:18.710 --> 06:20.803
and is orchestrating
a conspiracy so dangerous

06:20.840 --> 06:22.137
she had to hire a hit man

06:22.180 --> 06:23.807
to kill the people
who found out.

06:23.850 --> 06:25.806
And she wanted Reddington
executed.

06:25.850 --> 06:28.512
And despite all that,
somehow she's now our boss.

06:28.550 --> 06:30.939
Which is why
we have to proceed
with caution.

06:30.990 --> 06:32.514
Tell us about Olson.
What do we know?

06:32.560 --> 06:34.448
Well, for starters,
her name isn't Olson.

06:34.490 --> 06:35.855
No one knows
her real identity,

06:35.890 --> 06:37.949
only that she's a former
Wall Street analyst

06:37.990 --> 06:42.051
who made a fortune doing
quantitative risk analysis
for private equity firms.

06:42.100 --> 06:43.965
She facilitated
hostile takeovers.

06:44.000 --> 06:46.366
In the aftermath of
the 2008 financial meltdown,

06:46.400 --> 06:48.288
she re-emerged
as a corporate raider

06:48.340 --> 06:49.659
_ _ forthe
criminal underground...

06:49.710 --> 06:51.166
What exactly
is the problem?

06:51.210 --> 06:52.871
HALPERIN: Eikendoll.
She's a competitor,

06:52.910 --> 06:54.309
and her new
construction company

06:54.340 --> 06:55.830
is cutting into the Regal
bottom line.

06:55.880 --> 06:58.747
So you either want
to remove her or destroy her.

06:58.780 --> 07:00.543
I want to do both.

07:00.580 --> 07:03.743
Her approach to the Collington
Police Department is typical.

07:03.790 --> 07:05.883
Sheidenﬁﬁes
vulnerable businesses

07:05.920 --> 07:07.888
and then target maps them
until she knows

07:07.920 --> 07:09.353
every pressure point,

07:09.390 --> 07:11.824
which she then exerts
to strip them of their assets

07:11.860 --> 07:13.657
or absorb them...
Or, in this case,

07:13.700 --> 07:14.894
to sell out one cartel

07:14.930 --> 07:16.420
and pledge allegiance
to another...

07:16.470 --> 07:18.199
Who happened to be
her client.

07:18.230 --> 07:20.266
Reddington says
her clients range

07:20.300 --> 07:22.609
from a real estate developer
in Boston,

07:22.640 --> 07:24.528
to_ a crime lord
in Mumbai,

07:24.570 --> 07:26.265
to Ukrainian oligarchs.

07:26.310 --> 07:29.848
She commands
a seven; or even
eight-figure fee

07:29.880 --> 07:32.940
to help them expand
into both criminal
and legitimate businesses.

07:32.980 --> 07:34.447
_ So she hurts
innocent people.

07:34.480 --> 07:35.708
Just like Mr. Reddington.

07:38.320 --> 07:39.856
What?

07:39.890 --> 07:40.959
You know it's true.

07:42.890 --> 07:45.552
So, Olson.
What's our way in?

07:45.590 --> 07:47.057
Reddington says
she has a meeting

07:47.100 --> 07:48.954
with a prospective client.
He gave me a time and place.

07:49.000 --> 07:50.763
Get a tactical unit,
put together a plan

07:50.800 --> 07:52.597
to interrupt that meeting,
and bring her in.

07:52.640 --> 07:54.289
By taking her out,
we're helping Reddington

07:54.340 --> 07:56.262
extend his reach.
Are you okay
with us doing that?

07:56.300 --> 07:59.098
If it gets us closer
on Anna McMahon,
yes, I am.

07:59.140 --> 08:00.607
And the only way
it'll get us closer

08:00.640 --> 08:02.608
is if we keep her
from knowing
what we're up to.

08:02.650 --> 08:04.299
So, no mention
of her name. To anyone.

08:04.350 --> 08:05.977
I don't want McMahon
to know we're aware

08:06.010 --> 08:08.114
there's any connection
between her and Olson.

08:08.150 --> 08:09.276
Understood?

08:09.320 --> 08:10.742
Good. Roll out.

08:12.450 --> 08:15.453
Agent Mojtabai?
A word.

08:19.330 --> 08:22.766
The job requires a clear head
and complete focus.

08:22.800 --> 08:24.267
I know that's a lot to ask
at the moment,

08:24.300 --> 08:26.427
but it's the bare minimum.

08:26.470 --> 08:28.131
If you can't give it,
you need to let me know.

08:28.170 --> 08:29.569
I am focused, sir.

08:29.610 --> 08:31.760
I'm angry.
But I'm focused.

08:32.880 --> 08:34.472
In ways
I never thought possible.

08:35.310 --> 08:37.778
**

08:41.650 --> 08:42.981
Win-win?

08:43.020 --> 08:44.681
No. I didn't sign up
for a win-win.

08:44.720 --> 08:46.244
I signed up for win.

08:46.290 --> 08:47.712
Us winning. Not him.

08:47.760 --> 08:49.182
Reddington always has
an alternative agen...

08:49.220 --> 08:50.858
He's not Reddington.

08:50.890 --> 08:53.757
The only difference
is that we actually know
what it is this time.

08:53.800 --> 08:55.427
And that doesn't
bother you?

08:55.460 --> 08:57.291
That he didn't even have
to pretend anymore?

08:57.330 --> 08:59.833
That he's open about using us
to make him rich?

09:01.770 --> 09:04.762
Look, I know you hoped
that I'd be okay with us

09:04.810 --> 09:07.802
not pursuing who he really is,
but I'm not.

09:09.910 --> 09:11.172
This must be the client.

09:11.210 --> 09:12.643
Aram, we have a visual.

09:12.680 --> 09:13.840
Is everybody in place?

09:13.880 --> 09:15.245
We're not done talking
about this.

OLSON:
Hello, Mr. Reddington.

10:00.700 --> 10:02.156
You hearing this?
That's her.

10:02.200 --> 10:04.521
REDDINGTON: I've never made
a virtual acquaintance.

10:04.570 --> 10:08.233
I must say, it feels
pornographic.

10:08.270 --> 10:11.501
Well, an abundance of caution
is an occupational hazard.

10:11.540 --> 10:13.531
It sounds like she's on
some sort of video feed...

10:13.580 --> 10:15.468
Which means
she's broadcasting
to this location.

10:15.510 --> 10:17.273
Can you trace it?
I can try.

10:17.310 --> 10:18.777
Yeah, well, try fast.
Before Reddington

10:18.810 --> 10:20.277
double-crosses us again.

10:20.320 --> 10:21.742
OLSON: How might I be
of assistance?

10:21.780 --> 10:24.681
You convince people
to change allegiances.

10:24.720 --> 10:26.915
I'm hoping to convince you
to do the same.

10:26.960 --> 10:28.609
I'll make it
worth your while.

10:28.660 --> 10:30.719
I doubt that's possible.

10:30.760 --> 10:32.796
Well,
I guess we'll see.

10:32.830 --> 10:34.627
Who would you expect me
to betray?

10:35.160 --> 10:36.422
Anna McMahon.

10:36.930 --> 10:37.965
What is he doing?

10:38.000 --> 10:39.831
Exactly what you wanted us
to avoid.

41:31.750 --> 41:32.944
* Getting out of mine?

41:32.990 --> 41:34.116
Can you hear me?

41:37.890 --> 41:39.187
I know you're listening.

41:40.190 --> 41:41.999
* Well, now it's screaming red

41:42.030 --> 41:43.725
Watching me.

41:43.760 --> 41:45.728
* Watching the leaves
fall down

41:45.770 --> 41:47.795
Hoping I might go to her...

41:47.830 --> 41:49.889
* And laugh at us instead

41:49.940 --> 41:51.464
...but I won't.

41:54.010 --> 41:55.170
* Mm-mm-mm-mm

41:55.210 --> 41:57.599
DO you hear me?

41:57.640 --> 41:59.301
* Mm-mm-mm-mm *

41:59.350 --> 42:00.942
She's gone.

42:02.850 --> 42:05.148
**

42:08.890 --> 42:10.653
She's really gone.

42:23.070 --> 42:25.368
**
