WEBVTT

00:02.800 --> 00:05.428
(Bach's English Suite #3:
Gavotte plays)

00:14.610 --> 00:16.100
(music playing in earbuds)

00:22.790 --> 00:25.588
I'm sorry,
do you need that hot sauce?

00:26.620 --> 00:28.781
Thank you,
thank you.

00:28.820 --> 00:30.219
I do that, too.

00:30.260 --> 00:32.228
But with the
accordion.

00:32.260 --> 00:33.352
Ah.

00:33.400 --> 00:35.459
It_'s classical
piano, huh?

00:35.500 --> 00:36.819
With me, I can play

00:36.870 --> 00:39.191
"Old Grey Mare,"
that's just about it.

00:39.240 --> 00:41.196
Ah.

00:41.240 --> 00:43.606
I'm sorry if
I'm being nosy.

00:43.640 --> 00:45.767
Are you Eli Gold?

00:45.810 --> 00:47.778
Um, Eli Gold?

00:47.810 --> 00:49.209
Yes.

00:49.250 --> 00:50.342
I knew it.

00:50.380 --> 00:51.847
I saw you sitting there.

00:51.880 --> 00:54.769
I thought to myself, "That's Eli
Gold, the campaign manager."

00:54.820 --> 00:57.584
I didn't want to say anything
in case I was wrong.

00:57.620 --> 00:59.611
How's the campaign going?

00:59.660 --> 01:00.786
Good.

01:00.820 --> 01:02.424
Well, I am gonna
vote for your guy.

01:02.460 --> 01:03.586
I sure will.

01:03.630 --> 01:06.292
Thank you.

01:06.330 --> 01:08.798
Nice meeting you.

01:12.300 --> 01:15.189
You used to have
Wooster-Graff Industries

01:15.240 --> 01:16.639
as a client,
didn't you?

01:16.670 --> 01:18.706
Back when you were
a crisis manager?

01:18.740 --> 01:20.674
Last year sometime?

01:20.710 --> 01:23.178
Oh, I'm sorry.
Am I being nosy again?

01:23.210 --> 01:24.609
What do you need, Mr...?

01:24.650 --> 01:25.799
LaGuardia.

01:25.850 --> 01:27.272
David is good, though.

01:27.320 --> 01:30.380
I work for the Justice
Department when I'm not

01:30.420 --> 01:32.251
practicing the accordion,
so I was just...

01:32.290 --> 01:34.349
Oh, you gotta go?

01:34.390 --> 01:36.722
Look, I'm sorry.
I just wanted to

01:36.760 --> 01:39.149
talk to you about a
few things. Maybe...

01:40.860 --> 01:44.261
Get me Leshoure
from Wooster-Graff Industries.

01:44.300 --> 01:46.291
(Bach's English Suite #3:
Gavotte continues playing)

01:49.770 --> 01:52.807
NORA:
Greg Leshoure on two.

01:56.380 --> 01:59.417
Tell him I'll call him back.

01:59.450 --> 02:00.815
Oh!

02:03.290 --> 02:04.484
Nora, I need your phone.

02:04.520 --> 02:06.215
It's my mom.
Call her back!

02:06.260 --> 02:09.286
Mom, I have to call you back.
Come on!

02:14.230 --> 02:16.164
Diane Lockhart.

02:16.200 --> 02:19.397
This is a simple case.

02:19.440 --> 02:22.603
On that, I agree
with my respected colleague

02:22.640 --> 02:24.801
for the prosecution.

02:24.840 --> 02:28.298
Nine months ago, a young woman
named Brandi Colavito

02:28.340 --> 02:29.739
attended Alt-O-Rama,

02:29.780 --> 02:33.238
three-day music festival
here in Chicago.

02:33.280 --> 02:35.748
While there, she was murdered.

02:35.780 --> 02:39.352
The killer then took the body
50 miles south

02:39.390 --> 02:41.711
to her hometown, in Minooka,
in Grundy County,

02:41.760 --> 02:43.785
and dumped her.

02:43.830 --> 02:49.268
Now ASA Hellinger has seen fit
to charge my client,

02:49.300 --> 02:50.858
Troy Mallick,
a respected executive

02:52.400 --> 02:56.359
This despite the fact
that he had no motive

02:56.410 --> 02:58.298
and there were better suspects
in Minooka.

03:00.680 --> 03:02.545
So let's look at the evidence.

03:02.580 --> 03:06.209
WOMAN:
Her name was Brandi Colavito.

03:06.250 --> 03:07.478
She lived here in Minooka,

03:07.520 --> 03:10.978
went to Minooka Community High,
graduated,

03:11.020 --> 03:13.215
and moved away to Chicago
where she was murdered

03:13.260 --> 03:15.216
after a rock concert.

03:15.260 --> 03:17.649
You will hear evidence
that my client,

03:17.690 --> 03:20.250
Gary Kuharski, killed her.

03:20.300 --> 03:21.449
He didn't.

03:21.500 --> 03:23.559
You will hear evidence that
he was obsessed with Brandi,

03:23.600 --> 03:26.763
that he stalked her
after she broke up with him.

03:26.800 --> 03:28.290
He wasn't.

03:28.340 --> 03:29.762
You will hear evidence

03:29.810 --> 03:32.904
that he followed her
to the Chicago concert.

03:32.940 --> 03:34.578
That is untrue.

03:34.610 --> 03:35.770
But what ASA Hellinger
won't tell you

03:35.810 --> 03:37.846
is that Brandi
had an ex-boyfriend,

03:37.880 --> 03:39.416
a young man
living in her hometown,

03:39.450 --> 03:43.386
who became obsessed with her,
who stalked her.

03:43.420 --> 03:44.614
Now, you might ask
the prosecutor,

03:44.650 --> 03:46.618
why this is being prosecuted
here at all?

03:46.660 --> 03:48.355
The murder didn't take place
in Minooka.

03:48.390 --> 03:49.687
It took place in Chicago.

03:49.730 --> 03:52.528
Yes, the body
was transported here,

03:52.560 --> 03:55.358
but this is big-city business.

03:55.400 --> 03:56.992
Not our business.

03:57.030 --> 03:59.760
I'll tell you why Gary's
being prosecuted here.

03:59.800 --> 04:01.438
Because Cook County didn't think

04:01.470 --> 04:03.267
there was enough evidence
to charge him.

04:03.310 --> 04:04.060
Objection, Your Honor.

04:04.110 --> 04:05.930
Yes, Ms. Hoff,
let's not theorize

04:05.970 --> 04:09.303
on why someone did
or did not do something.

04:09.350 --> 04:10.840
And another thing Ms. Hellinger
won't tell you,

04:10.880 --> 04:12.541
not only is my client innocent,

04:12.580 --> 04:14.548
but there is someone_in another
county being tried...

04:14.580 --> 04:16.389
Objection, Your Honor!

04:18.450 --> 04:19.348
Someone from Minooka...

04:19.390 --> 04:22.689
Yes, outrage is thick
in the air. Approach.

04:22.730 --> 04:24.459
I'm not sure what the problem
is here, Your Honor.

04:24.490 --> 04:26.594
You gave Mr. Gardner specific
and explicit instructions

04:26.630 --> 04:28.598
Which I followed.
Which I followed to a T.
not to bring up...

04:28.630 --> 04:31.463
Mr. Gardner, I know you
like playing the bad boy.

04:31.500 --> 04:33.058
Do it on your own time,
not on mine.

04:33.100 --> 04:34.590
Your Honor, you warned me
not to bring up

04:34.640 --> 04:36.437
the name of the man
being tried in Minooka.

04:36.470 --> 04:37.937
And I have not,
even though this is

04:37.970 --> 04:39.779
a gross miscarriage
of justice.

04:39.810 --> 04:41.038
Has there ever been a mere
miscarriage of justice?

04:41.080 --> 04:42.377
Why is it always a gross one?

04:42.410 --> 04:46.870
You were warned not_ to
bring up the other trial
at all, Mr. Gardner.

04:46.920 --> 04:49.047
They're mentioning our trial
there, Your Honor.

04:49.080 --> 04:50.547
Yes, and if the judge
in Minooka wants

04:50.590 --> 04:52.615
to allow that,
that's his prerogative.

04:52.660 --> 04:53.718
HELLINGER:
He wants a mistrial, Your Honor.

04:53.760 --> 04:55.887
Mr. Gardner has delayed
this court date for months,

04:55.920 --> 04:58.059
hoping the other trial would
result in a guilty verdict.

04:58.090 --> 04:59.489
I would have to agree.

04:59.530 --> 05:01.088
You're not getting a mistrial,
Mr. Gardner,

05:01.130 --> 05:04.896
and I will hold you in contempt
and fine you $10,000.

05:04.930 --> 05:06.989
And your next offense?

05:07.040 --> 05:08.462
You will find yourself
in a jail cell.

05:08.500 --> 05:10.036
And if this Minooka trial
results

05:10.070 --> 05:12.436
in a guilty verdict,
Your Honor?

05:12.480 --> 05:14.801
If another person
is found guilty of this murder,

05:14.840 --> 05:18.105
yes, then you may present
that evidence to the jury,

05:18.150 --> 05:19.640
but not before.

05:19.680 --> 05:22.342
Do you understand?
I do, Your Honor.

05:22.390 --> 05:23.379
All right, then step back.

05:23.420 --> 05:26.355
And, Mr. Gardner, behave.

05:26.390 --> 05:28.483
How are you enjoying
the big leagues?

05:28.520 --> 05:29.680
Is that what this is?

05:29.730 --> 05:31.379
Seemed pretty
bush league to me.

05:31.430 --> 05:33.125
ALICIA:
Mr. State's Attorney?

05:33.160 --> 05:35.526
I'm Alicia Florrick-- I left
a message with your office.

05:35.560 --> 05:37.767
Yes, and the answer is no.
The answer?
I haven't even

05:37.800 --> 05:39.836
asked the question yet.
You want to
help me, right?

05:39.870 --> 05:41.531
If I get a guilty verdict
for him,

05:41.570 --> 05:43.538
your guy in Chicago goes free.

05:43.570 --> 05:44.639
Well, that's the hope.

05:44.670 --> 05:46.035
I don't like defense
attorneys, ma'am.

05:46.070 --> 05:47.435
I don't trust them.

05:47.480 --> 05:48.970
Mr. State's Attorney,
we have access

05:49.010 --> 05:50.807
to the Cook County
Medical Examiner's files.

05:50.850 --> 05:52.545
We have an outside
foren5ic analy5is...

05:52.580 --> 05:53.569
Good day, ma'am.

05:57.490 --> 05:58.889
(sighs)

06:02.020 --> 06:05.421
Hi. He doesn't want our help.

06:05.460 --> 06:06.597
WILL:
He will.

06:06.630 --> 06:08.393
Kalinda is getting
a soil sample tonight.

06:08.430 --> 06:11.399
Do a search on a type
of soil called clay loam.

06:11.430 --> 06:13.489
Oh. Um, I'll write up
a brief on it.

06:13.540 --> 06:14.529
How's Troy doing?

06:14.570 --> 06:16.765
Notgood.
Deer in the headlights.

06:16.810 --> 06:18.960
I wish you were here
to hand-hold him.

06:19.010 --> 06:20.875
Oh, you're not bad
at that yourself.

06:20.910 --> 06:23.401
Thanks, but I'm not so sure.

06:23.450 --> 06:24.508
Drive safe.

06:24.550 --> 06:26.472
Okay.

06:26.520 --> 06:30.115
Alicia said to say hi.
You all right?

06:30.150 --> 06:32.118
My parents think
the jury doesn't like me.

06:32.150 --> 06:34.550
One thing I know
is you can't read a jury.

06:34.590 --> 06:36.820
You can't let 'em get
into your head.

06:36.860 --> 06:38.487
You just gotta play it cool

06:38.530 --> 06:41.658
and let them know
that you're innocent.

06:41.700 --> 06:43.964
I was approached
today by a DO] agent

06:44.000 --> 06:45.422
named David LaGuardia.

06:45.470 --> 06:46.437
Approached?

06:46.470 --> 06:48.563
In what way approached?

06:48.600 --> 06:49.999
An off-the-record drop-by
over lunch.

06:50.040 --> 06:51.564
What did he say?

06:51.610 --> 06:54.602
He mentioned
Wooster-Graff Industries.

06:54.640 --> 06:57.108
I managed the bad publicity
around their IPO last year.

06:57.150 --> 06:58.777
But I left before
he said anything more.

06:58.810 --> 06:59.970
Good.

07:00.020 --> 07:01.544
Did something happen
at Wooster-Graff

07:01.580 --> 07:02.842
that I should know about?

07:02.890 --> 07:04.209
Completely aboveboard.
Completely legal.

07:04.250 --> 07:07.117
Then they're just fishing.
I wouldn't worry about it.

07:17.200 --> 07:18.997
He gave you this?

07:19.030 --> 07:19.997
No.

07:20.040 --> 07:21.166
Where did you get this?

07:21.200 --> 07:22.508
I can't say.

07:26.880 --> 07:29.235
I had the floor checked.
It's empty. A bankruptcy.

07:29.280 --> 07:32.647
When was this?
I don't know.
A year ago, maybe.

07:32.680 --> 07:36.684
I moved that
painting a bit.

07:36.720 --> 07:39.587
Do you want me to go to Justice?

07:39.620 --> 07:42.009
I am in the middle
of a campaign, Diane.

07:42.060 --> 07:43.618
The rumor of an investigation

07:43.660 --> 07:44.820
is often worse
than a result.

07:44.860 --> 07:48.193
I need you, if you don't mind,
to keep this confidential.

07:48.230 --> 07:49.595
Of course.

07:49.630 --> 07:52.121
No, I mean, from
the candidate.

07:52.170 --> 07:54.991
You mean,
don't put Alicia on it?

07:55.040 --> 07:57.508
Or Will.

07:57.540 --> 07:59.872
ZACH (from other room):
Can I use the computer, Mom?

07:59.910 --> 08:01.832
For homework?

08:01.880 --> 08:03.245
Yes.

08:03.280 --> 08:05.202
In a minute. I'm almost done.

08:19.330 --> 08:22.026
Don't worry, Mom,
I got it.

08:23.000 --> 08:25.059
Mom?

08:25.100 --> 08:28.558
Uh, yeah, good. Okay.

08:32.010 --> 08:33.807
MAN:
Tom Szabo.

08:33.840 --> 08:36.673
I work as evidence technician
for Grundy County.

08:36.710 --> 08:39.099
And you collected evidence
at two sites, Mr. Szabo:

08:39.150 --> 08:41.573
locally, where
the body was found,

08:41.620 --> 08:43.588
and also at the murder site.

08:43.620 --> 08:45.315
Yes, I received permission
from Cook County

08:45.350 --> 08:47.079
to observe their
collection there.

08:47.120 --> 08:49.953
And what did you find that was
identical at both sites?

08:49.990 --> 08:51.821
A shoe impression.
This one?

08:51.860 --> 08:53.748
Yes, the one on
the right is from

08:53.800 --> 08:56.598
the murder scene, and the one on
the left is from the body site.

08:56.630 --> 08:59.565
And did you find a match
for this shoe impression?

08:59.600 --> 09:01.659
Yes, sir.
In Mr. Kuharski's closet.

09:01.700 --> 09:03.600
They were size 11
Saturn running shoes.

09:05.710 --> 09:07.678
Thank you, sir.
Nothing further.

09:07.710 --> 09:09.337
HOFF:
Mr. Szabo,

09:09.380 --> 09:13.168
you say you compared
the shoe impression

09:13.220 --> 09:14.847
to my client's sneakers,

09:14.880 --> 09:17.189
but did you also compare it
to Troy Mallick's sneakers?

09:17.220 --> 09:18.847
Objection, Your Honor.
Relevance.

09:18.890 --> 09:19.811
You've already ruled this

09:19.860 --> 09:21.714
parallel Chicago trial relevant,
Your Honor.

09:21.760 --> 09:23.978
If the shoe impression matches
the Chicago defendant,

09:24.030 --> 09:25.884
that's highly relevant.

09:25.930 --> 09:27.249
Yep, Alma, that's right.

09:27.300 --> 09:29.291
Sorry, Lee, I will overrule.

09:29.330 --> 09:31.025
SZABO:
I did not compare
the impression.

09:31.070 --> 09:33.595
But the Illinois
Crime Lab did.

09:33.640 --> 09:35.335
Mr. Szabo, can you read

09:35.370 --> 09:37.008
what it says in their
determination?

09:37.040 --> 09:39.008
"Based upon a comparison
of the shoe impressions

09:39.040 --> 09:41.736
"with the size 11 footwear
worn by Troy Mallick,

09:41.780 --> 09:43.645
we determine a match."

09:43.680 --> 09:45.648
HOFF:
So, you think
the shoe impression

09:45.680 --> 09:48.342
matches my client's shoes,
but the Chicago team

09:48.380 --> 09:50.883
thinks it matches
Troy Mallick's shoes.

09:50.920 --> 09:52.717
Which one do you
suppose it is?

09:52.760 --> 09:53.852
Objection!

09:53.890 --> 09:55.209
Thank you. Nothing further.

09:57.230 --> 10:01.223
You're losing.
You need that.

10:03.400 --> 10:05.891
Mr. Szabo, as a forensic
evidence technician,

10:05.930 --> 10:08.660
did you perform an analysis
of the soil

10:08.700 --> 10:09.701
from Mr. Kuharski's sneakers?

10:09.740 --> 10:12.265
Yes, but unfortunately,
I didn't have a sample

10:12.310 --> 10:14.107
from the murder site
to compare it to.

10:14.140 --> 10:16.802
Because the lab in Chicago
failed to release one to you?

10:16.850 --> 10:19.978
That's right. There was a bit
of a jurisdictional dispute.

10:20.020 --> 10:20.816
I understand.

10:20.850 --> 10:23.648
Prosecution Exhibit D,
Your Honor.

10:23.690 --> 10:25.908
This is an analysis of the soil
from the murder site.

10:25.950 --> 10:28.657
Objection. This is not on
the prosecution's exhibit list.

10:28.690 --> 10:29.918
We've just become aware of it.

10:29.960 --> 10:31.825
Because Mr. Tripke was handed it

10:31.860 --> 10:33.828
by someone
in the gallery.

10:33.860 --> 10:35.851
Yes, I think I recognize
our illustrious guest.

10:35.900 --> 10:38.118
We've had dealings before,
haven't we, Ms...?

10:38.170 --> 10:41.094
Mrs. Florrick.
Ah, yes.

10:41.140 --> 10:43.734
And you're providing evidence
to our state's attorney?

10:43.770 --> 10:45.260
A soil analysis
from the crime scene.

10:45.310 --> 10:46.265
There's nothing
prohibiting that.

10:46.310 --> 10:47.402
JUDGE:
That is certainly true.

10:47.440 --> 10:48.805
Unorthodox,
but not prohibited.

10:48.840 --> 10:50.979
I'll allow,
subject to verification.

10:51.010 --> 10:52.272
Thank you,
Your Honor.

10:52.310 --> 10:54.414
So, Mr. Szabo,
this analysis shows

10:54.450 --> 10:57.783
that the soil from Alt-O-Rama,
from the murder site,

10:57.820 --> 11:00.789
was _called
drummer Silt clay loam.

11:02.760 --> 11:04.728
And that's a very unique
soil type.

11:05.930 --> 11:07.090
And could you tell me

11:07.130 --> 11:09.189
what type of soil
was found in the tread

11:09.230 --> 11:10.424
of the defendant's shoe?

11:10.470 --> 11:11.994
Drummer silt clay loam.

11:12.030 --> 11:14.191
And didn't the defendant say
he was never

11:14.240 --> 11:15.696
at the concert?
Objection.

11:15.740 --> 11:17.037
Beyond the scope.

11:17.070 --> 11:18.765
Withdrawn.

11:18.810 --> 11:21.904
Anything else you have,
I'm open.

11:35.490 --> 11:38.948
(knocking, door opens)
I'm done with the desktop

11:38.990 --> 11:39.991
if you need the hard line.

11:40.030 --> 11:42.021
The Wi-Fi's working
now. Thanks.

11:45.970 --> 11:47.767
What did I do?

11:47.800 --> 11:49.336
Nothing.
The dent was
already there.

11:49.370 --> 11:50.906
Zach, I'm...

11:50.940 --> 11:52.259
What dent?

11:52.310 --> 11:54.107
The dent on the car.

11:54.140 --> 11:54.902
It was already there.

11:54.940 --> 11:56.237
Someone must have opened
their door

11:56.280 --> 11:57.440
and hit it.
Okay.

11:57.480 --> 11:59.107
Um, that's not why I'm here.

11:59.150 --> 12:01.345
1-1 was just, um,

12:01.380 --> 12:03.086
wondering how you are.

12:03.120 --> 12:05.088
Good.
Good.

12:05.120 --> 12:06.519
And Nisa?

12:06.550 --> 12:08.211
You're still dating?

12:08.260 --> 12:10.023
Yeah.

12:10.060 --> 12:11.459
How old is she now?

12:11.490 --> 12:15.028
Nisa? 15.

12:15.060 --> 12:16.288
I thought you liked Nisa.

12:16.330 --> 12:17.490
No, I do.

12:17.530 --> 12:20.533
Um, I'm just wondering...

12:20.570 --> 12:24.358
do we need to have
a conversation?

12:24.410 --> 12:26.207
About?

12:27.240 --> 12:29.003
Sex.

12:29.040 --> 12:31.042
Uh, Mom, no.

12:31.080 --> 12:32.001
No, I'm fine, really.

12:32.050 --> 12:34.109
Well, we agreed that
if there was ever anything

12:34.150 --> 12:36.015
you needed to talk about...
Yeah, and there's not.

12:36.050 --> 12:37.415
Really, I'm good.

12:37.450 --> 12:40.214
And we already did talk
about that.

12:42.930 --> 12:46.855
I... I did a search
on my computer,

12:46.900 --> 12:48.925
and when I typed
in the question,

12:48.960 --> 12:51.167
it said that the previous search

12:51.200 --> 12:53.065
was for types of condoms.

12:55.070 --> 12:57.163
And you thought it was me

12:57.210 --> 12:59.098
that searched
for types of condoms?

12:59.140 --> 13:01.870
Well, I mean,
you use the hard line.

13:02.880 --> 13:04.347
So does Grace.

13:04.380 --> 13:06.405
Grace?

13:06.450 --> 13:07.849
Yeah.

13:07.880 --> 13:09.279
And she's seeing Connor now.

13:09.320 --> 13:11.140
She's seeing him?

13:11.190 --> 13:14.011
Yes, and I would never
hunt on your computer.

13:14.060 --> 13:16.824
And if I did, I know how
to scrub a search cache clean.

13:16.860 --> 13:18.157
Okay, thanks. Let's not rub

13:18.190 --> 13:21.159
your sophistication
in my face, please.

13:39.410 --> 13:41.878
Mrs. Florrick?

13:41.920 --> 13:44.480
Nick Saverese is waiting for you
in the conference room.

13:44.520 --> 13:46.044
Do you know why?

13:46.090 --> 13:48.081
No. He didn't seem happy.

13:51.090 --> 13:53.058
I don't want Cary on my case.

13:53.100 --> 13:54.453
You don't want Cary? Why?

13:54.500 --> 13:56.195
I want you
or one of the other partners.

13:56.230 --> 13:57.868
Well, I'm working on something
full-time at the moment.

13:57.900 --> 14:00.130
Is there a specific problem?

14:00.170 --> 14:03.606
Yeah, he accused me
of running drugs.

14:03.640 --> 14:05.130
He...

14:05.170 --> 14:07.001
How did he do that?

14:07.040 --> 14:09.133
Well, he came to my lot
and he said, as my lawyer

14:09.180 --> 14:11.205
and as a friend of _
the state's attorney's office,

14:11.250 --> 14:12.547
he knew what I was doing,

14:12.580 --> 14:16.471
using the cars we towed
to move drugs.

14:18.520 --> 14:20.078
Huh.

14:20.120 --> 14:22.179
Yeah.

14:22.220 --> 14:23.619
Would you give me a minute?

14:35.240 --> 14:37.128
Mr. Saverese,
I talked to the partners

14:37.170 --> 14:38.262
and we must apologize,

14:38.310 --> 14:40.107
but we can't
represent you anymore.

14:40.140 --> 14:41.300
Really? Why?

14:41.340 --> 14:43.171
It's not to our benefit.

14:43.210 --> 14:45.599
Okay.

14:45.650 --> 14:48.210
You know, the last time
it weren't to your benefit,

14:48.250 --> 14:49.911
the partners took me back.

14:49.950 --> 14:52.180
They sent me an apology
with a gift basket.

14:52.220 --> 14:53.585
Yes, but that was

14:53.620 --> 14:56.214
when you had a $25 million
governmental bid.

14:56.260 --> 14:58.182
You lost that some time ago,

14:58.230 --> 15:00.289
and it doesn't look like
you're getting it back.

15:02.200 --> 15:05.294
You didn't talk to the partners.

15:05.330 --> 15:07.696
You talked to Cary.

15:07.740 --> 15:11.562
I'm sorry, Mr. Saverese,
we have to let you go.

15:11.610 --> 15:13.601
(groans)

15:19.280 --> 15:23.148
I know you're the wife
of the state's attorney.

15:23.190 --> 15:26.239
You don't want to say anything
to anyone

15:26.290 --> 15:29.054
about this drug charge.

15:29.090 --> 15:31.229
Even

15:31.260 --> 15:35.048
Attorney client privilege
and all that.

15:37.100 --> 15:40.035
Here's the thing, Mr. Saverese,

15:40.070 --> 15:42.163
attorney client privilege

15:42.200 --> 15:44.339
is voided
if I'm threatened.

15:44.370 --> 15:46.167
So let me ask you this,

15:46.210 --> 15:48.235
and I suggest
you take a moment

15:48.280 --> 15:50.168
before answering.

15:50.210 --> 15:53.077
Are you threatening me?

15:54.450 --> 15:56.270
You decide.

16:00.260 --> 16:02.285
MAN:
Brandt Claussen, OLS Security.

16:02.320 --> 16:03.548
We are first and we are fast.

16:03.590 --> 16:05.228
HELLINGER:
And on the night in question,

16:05.260 --> 16:06.488
were you working security
for Alt-O-Rama?

16:06.530 --> 16:08.122
I was.

16:08.160 --> 16:09.422
And you tell us...

16:09.460 --> 16:11.189
No, strike that.

16:11.230 --> 16:12.492
Did you see the defendant

16:12.530 --> 16:14.191
with the victim,
Brandi Colavito?

16:14.240 --> 16:15.161
Yes.

16:15.200 --> 16:17.407
I saw them fighting,
yelling at each other.

16:17.440 --> 16:19.328
And afterwards?
Well, he basically followed
her into the woods,

16:19.370 --> 16:23.204
where the concertgoers camp
and I heard her screaming.

16:23.250 --> 16:24.569
You heard Brandi screaming.
What was she screaming?

16:24.610 --> 16:26.168
Objection, hearsay.

16:26.210 --> 16:27.609
Res gestae exception,
Your Honor.

16:27.650 --> 16:29.208
Overruled. You may answer.

16:29.250 --> 16:31.013
"Get away from me.

16:31.050 --> 16:32.415
Stop it."

16:32.450 --> 16:35.214
And then it just
suddenly stopped, her screaming.

16:35.260 --> 16:36.386
So then I basically

16:36.420 --> 16:38.581
ran into the woods
to see what happened,

16:38.630 --> 16:40.552
and I couldn't
find her at first.

16:40.600 --> 16:43.296
But then I found
the bloody clothing.

16:43.330 --> 16:44.399
No sign of Troy?
No.

16:44.430 --> 16:46.068
I guess I got there too late.

16:46.100 --> 16:48.068
He must have taken the body.

16:48.100 --> 16:49.260
Objection, Your Honor.
Speculation.

16:49.300 --> 16:52.701
Sustained.
Mr. Gardner, I've concluded
my questioning.

16:52.740 --> 16:54.435
Thank you, ASA Hellinger.

16:54.480 --> 16:56.436
So, Mr. Claussen,

16:56.480 --> 16:58.607
you heard Brandi screaming,
"Get away from me. Stop it."

16:58.650 --> 17:01.710
And how far away were you
at this time, approximately.

17:01.750 --> 17:03.388
From the screaming?

17:03.420 --> 17:05.388
I guess about 80 yards.

17:05.420 --> 17:06.546
And you heard it clearly?
Yes.

17:06.590 --> 17:08.057
It was awful.

17:08.090 --> 17:09.216
And what are these?

17:09.260 --> 17:10.352
Earplugs.

17:10.390 --> 17:11.721
And you're provided these

17:11.760 --> 17:13.250
by the stadium because
of the loud music

17:13.300 --> 17:15.222
to keep you from going deaf?

17:15.260 --> 17:16.249
Yes.

17:16.300 --> 17:19.519
Were you wearing them
that night?

17:19.570 --> 17:20.832
Was that a yes?

17:20.870 --> 17:22.690
Yes.
Could you put them in?

17:22.740 --> 17:24.139
I'd like to try something.

17:24.170 --> 17:25.398
Objection, Your Honor.

17:25.440 --> 17:26.566
Must we have the dramatics?

17:26.610 --> 17:28.373
Well, the witness has sworn
to hearing the screaming.

17:28.410 --> 17:30.344
I just want to see if he could.
A little drama

17:30.380 --> 17:31.574
never hurt anyone,
Ms. Hellinger.

17:31.610 --> 17:32.702
Please put them in.

17:32.750 --> 17:35.469
Now I'm gonna ask my associate
to step out into the hall.

17:35.520 --> 17:38.239
That's not exactly 80 yards.

17:38.290 --> 17:39.712
It's probably 30.

17:39.750 --> 17:42.116
Can you just tell us what
you hear, Mr. Claussen.

17:42.160 --> 17:42.819
Huh?

17:42.860 --> 17:44.179
(chuckles)
I'm sorry.

17:44.230 --> 17:45.356
Just tell us what you hear.

17:46.760 --> 17:50.594
KALINDA:
I'm not being murdered!

17:50.630 --> 17:52.359
I'm just screaming
in the hallway!

17:56.440 --> 17:59.329
Um...

18:00.710 --> 18:01.836
Cute.

18:01.880 --> 18:03.370
Thanks.
Offer a plea bargain.

18:03.410 --> 18:04.240
Why?

18:04.280 --> 18:06.145
I hear it's going very well
in Minooka.

18:06.180 --> 18:08.569
They find their guy guilty,
your case evaporates.

18:08.620 --> 18:11.384
Yes, and if their guy confessed,
my case would evaporate, too,

18:11.420 --> 18:13.411
but it's not gonna happen.

18:16.490 --> 18:17.787
Matan.

18:19.790 --> 18:21.451
I think I need your help.

18:25.270 --> 18:27.158
KALINDA:
Hey, I thought you were

18:27.200 --> 18:28.462
heading up to Minooka.
I am.

18:28.500 --> 18:29.831
I'm late.

18:29.870 --> 18:31.667
What's wrong?

18:33.880 --> 18:35.836
Should I be afraid
of your husband?

18:35.880 --> 18:38.474
No.

18:38.510 --> 18:40.341
Why?

18:40.380 --> 18:42.177
He was here.

18:42.220 --> 18:43.448
VVhen?

18:43.490 --> 18:45.378
This morning.

18:45.420 --> 18:48.253
I told him we were _
no longer representing him.

18:48.290 --> 18:51.384
He didn't take it very well.

18:51.430 --> 18:54.456
He's worried that Cary and I

18:54.500 --> 18:56.889
might tell someone
that he's moving drugs.

18:59.730 --> 19:02.198
Did I do the right thing?

19:02.240 --> 19:04.606
Telling him
we no longer represent him?

19:07.980 --> 19:09.629
And I'm not in danger?

19:09.680 --> 19:11.568
No.

19:11.610 --> 19:14.477
You won't be.

19:17.420 --> 19:19.411
Good.

19:31.870 --> 19:34.566
Captain Tim Resnick,
Chief of Investigations

19:34.600 --> 19:36.295
at the Minooka
Police Department.

19:38.670 --> 19:41.332
with Mr. Kuharski prior
to arresting him for murder?

19:41.380 --> 19:42.404
Yes, three months ago,

19:42.440 --> 19:46.274
I was called to the scene
of a domestic dispute.

19:46.310 --> 19:48.449
Mr. Kuharski had beaten Brandi
around the face and neck.

19:48.480 --> 19:49.469
Did you arrest him

19:49.520 --> 19:51.442
at that time?
We did.

19:51.490 --> 19:52.809
But he posted bail,

19:52.850 --> 19:54.408
and Brandi declined
to press charges.

19:54.460 --> 19:57.486
And was this the last time
you found the two

19:57.530 --> 19:58.724
in such a situation?

19:58.760 --> 20:00.227
No, Brandi eventually

20:00.260 --> 20:01.557
obtained a
restraining order

20:01.600 --> 20:03.795
against him.
Thank you, Detective.

20:03.830 --> 20:07.288
Your witness.

20:07.340 --> 20:09.399
They're getting help from Cook
County-- that man is an ASA.

20:09.440 --> 20:10.702
JUDGE:
Alma, you have
something there?

20:10.740 --> 20:11.866
Uh, yes, Your Honor.

20:11.910 --> 20:13.002
We do.

20:13.040 --> 20:14.632
Detective Resnick,

20:14.680 --> 20:18.707
when did you first turn
to my client as a suspect?

20:18.750 --> 20:20.377
When did I?

20:20.420 --> 20:22.445
Probably after I saw
the murder scene evidence

20:22.480 --> 20:23.811
from the Chicago police.

20:23.850 --> 20:25.818
Hmm, not before?

20:25.850 --> 20:29.684
You didn't have
any foregone conclu5ions before?

20:29.720 --> 20:31.688
No, always keep an open mind.

20:31.730 --> 20:34.290
Odd, because I have here
the notes

20:34.330 --> 20:36.355
from a Detective Collier
of the Chicago police.

20:36.400 --> 20:37.594
Objection, Your Honor.

20:37.630 --> 20:39.621
That is not on
the exhibit list.

20:39.670 --> 20:43.265
Yes, we just
became aware of it.

20:43.310 --> 20:46.268
JUDGE:
Yeah, we seem to have
a very odd situation here.

20:46.310 --> 20:48.801
A Chicago defense attorney
helping our prosecutor

20:48.840 --> 20:50.808
and a... I'm sorry.

20:50.850 --> 20:52.499
Would you like
to introduce yourself, sir?

20:52.550 --> 20:55.417
Matan Brody, Your Honor,
Cook County ASA.

20:55.450 --> 20:56.712
Just call me Murph.

20:56.750 --> 20:58.718
A Chicago defense attorney

20:58.750 --> 21:00.957
helping our prosecutor.

21:00.990 --> 21:03.288
A Chicago prosecutor
helping our defense.

21:03.330 --> 21:04.627
I thought I'd seen it all.

21:04.660 --> 21:05.979
Well...

21:06.030 --> 21:07.952
Your objection is
overruled, Lee.

21:08.000 --> 21:10.719
Please proceed, Ms. Hoff.

21:10.770 --> 21:11.998
I'm aglow with anticipation.

21:12.030 --> 21:13.463
As I was saying,

21:13.500 --> 21:15.593
I have the Chicago detective's
notes here.

21:15.640 --> 21:17.562
Perhaps you could read
from the highlighted portion.

21:17.610 --> 21:20.067
"Received a call

21:20.110 --> 21:22.635
"from Detective Resnick
in Minooka.

21:22.680 --> 21:26.571
Strongly believes killer
is ex-boyfriend."

21:26.610 --> 21:27.838
Yeah.

21:27.880 --> 21:29.939
Sounds like prejudging to me.

21:29.980 --> 21:32.517
Objection, Your Honor.
Sustained.

21:32.550 --> 21:33.983
WILL:
What?

21:34.020 --> 21:35.851
ALICIA:
Matan is here,
helping the defense.

21:35.890 --> 21:37.482
You're kidding.

21:37.530 --> 21:39.327
Having some trouble
out there in Minooka?

21:39.360 --> 21:40.452
I'll call you back.

21:40.500 --> 21:41.694
I wonder what the
taxpayers would say

21:41.730 --> 21:43.698
about you helping
the defense

21:43.730 --> 21:45.595
in another county
get a murderer off.
Probably the same thing

21:45.630 --> 21:46.995
your creditors would say
about you sending

21:47.030 --> 21:48.361
the state's attorney's wife.

21:48.400 --> 21:50.800
Whoever loses buys
the other drinks.

21:52.570 --> 21:54.470
You're gonna lose.

21:55.880 --> 21:58.701
LaGUARDIA:
No music today,

21:58.750 --> 21:59.705
Mr. Gold?

21:59.750 --> 22:00.842
Mr. LaGuardia,

22:00.880 --> 22:04.338
I have asked my client not
to answer your questions.

22:04.390 --> 22:05.618
Please talk to me only.

22:05.650 --> 22:07.857
Certainly.
What do you need, Ms. Lockhart?

22:07.890 --> 22:11.553
Why is the Public Integrity
Division looking into my client?

22:11.590 --> 22:14.058
Who says we're looking
into anything?

22:14.100 --> 22:17.627
Well, if you're not, then
consider this a polite request.

22:17.670 --> 22:20.025
Don't approach or surveil
my client again.

22:20.070 --> 22:23.858
Any further such efforts would
be considered harassment.

22:23.910 --> 22:25.866
I only approached your client
once-- that hardly warrants,

22:25.910 --> 22:27.935
uh...

22:31.650 --> 22:33.641
Ms. Lockhart, uh...

22:35.120 --> 22:37.111
You're showing...

22:39.050 --> 22:43.680
This is a photo I have
no previous knowledge of.

22:43.730 --> 22:47.496
If what you showed me
is indeed DOJ work product,

22:47.530 --> 22:49.919
whoever gave you that photo
broke the law.

22:49.960 --> 22:52.428
Good to know,
now, what are you after?

22:54.200 --> 22:55.997
You know my division
investigates

22:56.040 --> 22:58.133
campaign finance violations.
Yes, which has

22:58.170 --> 23:01.003
nothing to do with Mr. Gold's
crisis management.
Except some

23:01.040 --> 23:02.632
of Mr. Gold's biggest
clients have recently

23:02.680 --> 23:03.840
become donors_
to his Wife's campaign.

23:03.880 --> 23:06.041
You're kidding me.
Eli...

23:06.080 --> 23:08.014
There is nothing illegal
about clients exercising

23:08.050 --> 23:09.779
their First Amendment rights.

23:09.820 --> 23:11.913
As long as it's at
arm's length, yes.

23:11.950 --> 23:15.750
But a quid pro quo
in which Mr. Gold offers savings

23:15.790 --> 23:17.621
to crisis management client
in trade

23:17.660 --> 23:19.821
for contributionto
a political campaign,

23:19.860 --> 23:21.623
that is illegal.

23:21.660 --> 23:23.696
Discount for donations.

23:23.730 --> 23:24.867
And that is what
you're accusmg?

23:24.900 --> 23:28.461
No... that is_what
we are investigating.

23:31.710 --> 23:33.735
HOFF:
Your Honor, we ask that the
following evidence be admitted.

23:33.780 --> 23:35.873
Cook County crime scene photos
of the car trunk

23:35.910 --> 23:37.673
belonging to Troy Mallick.

23:37.710 --> 23:39.849
Got something from your Cook
County friend here, have you?

23:39.880 --> 23:43.611
Yes, Your Honor.
It is lovely how prosecutors,

23:43.650 --> 23:45.538
defense attorneys
are all working together here.

23:45.590 --> 23:47.854
It gives one hope.

23:47.890 --> 23:50.188
We also ask that_ the
accompanying eVIdentiary report

23:50.220 --> 23:52.757
of fabric trace evidence
be admitted.
_ _TRIPKE:
Objection, Your Honor.

23:52.790 --> 23:53.654
This evidence is subject to

23:53.700 --> 23:55.554
Fruit of the Poisonous Tree
exclu5ion.

23:55.600 --> 23:57.727
Someone illuminate me here--
what is this eVIdence?

23:57.770 --> 23:59.761
(whispering)

23:59.800 --> 24:01.961
That's right.
Take your time.

24:02.000 --> 24:04.503
Your Honor, this is evidence
collected from the car trunk

24:04.540 --> 24:06.838
of the Chicago defendant
Troy Mallick.

24:06.870 --> 24:08.872
The man with whom the victim
attended the concert.

24:08.910 --> 24:10.468
Now as you can see,

24:10.510 --> 24:13.809
_trace evidence from the
Victim's clothing was found

24:13.850 --> 24:16.819
in his car trunk, suggesting
the Chicago defendant

24:16.850 --> 24:19.739
transported
the victim...
No, it does not
suggest that.

24:19.790 --> 24:21.951
The Chicago defendant explained
this evidence.

24:21.990 --> 24:23.582
He carried a grocery bag...

24:23.630 --> 24:24.858
Sleeping!
Sleeping bag
in his trunk.

24:24.890 --> 24:26.721
And the fabric transferred
from the bag.

24:26.760 --> 24:27.852
Well, if the prosecution
believes that,

24:27.900 --> 24:28.924
then let them argue it in court.

24:28.960 --> 24:30.518
Your Honor, the
Chicago police

24:30.570 --> 24:31.992
searched the trunk
without a warrant,

24:32.030 --> 24:34.032
that is why this evidence
was barred from court.

24:34.070 --> 24:36.561
Yeah, no, Chicago court,
not Minooka court.

24:36.600 --> 24:38.238
But the same rules apply.
MATAN:
No!

24:38.270 --> 24:39.168
Fruit of the Poisonous Tree
argument applies

24:39.210 --> 24:41.735
to due process
of the Chicago defendant.

24:41.780 --> 24:43.702
She's using that
as exculpatory

24:43.750 --> 24:45.502
evidence for a totally
different defendant.

24:45.550 --> 24:46.699
ALICIA:
Yes, but due to the
constitutional

24:46.750 --> 24:49.514
exclusion,
this evidence was never subject

24:49.550 --> 24:52.678
to the same stringent analysis
as the defendant in Chicago...

24:52.720 --> 24:54.813
(all arguing indistinctly)

24:54.860 --> 24:56.987
Thank you.
(yells): Thank-thank you.

24:57.020 --> 24:58.920
One and all.

24:58.960 --> 25:01.849
What we have here
is a battle of the proxies,

25:01.900 --> 25:03.868
and unfortunately,
Ms. Florrick, Mr. Tripke,

25:03.900 --> 25:06.960
the fruit of the poisonous
tree grows in Chicago.

25:07.000 --> 25:10.197
Its limbs do not extend here.

25:10.240 --> 25:12.265
We will allow this evidence.

25:16.340 --> 25:18.149
What else you got?

25:18.180 --> 25:20.648
I'll get back to you.

25:24.890 --> 25:26.118
(knocking on door)

25:26.150 --> 25:27.959
Use the one in the living room!

25:27.990 --> 25:30.151
(door opens)
ALICIA:
It's me.

25:30.190 --> 25:33.284
Oh, Mom.
Hey, sorry.

25:33.330 --> 25:35.798
What's wrong?

25:35.830 --> 25:37.195
Nothing.

25:37.230 --> 25:38.891
Why does everyone think
something's wrong

25:38.930 --> 25:40.227
when I come to their room.

25:40.270 --> 25:41.760
Everyone?

25:41.800 --> 25:42.869
Who's everyone?

25:42.900 --> 25:46.609
My children-- my various
children throughout Chicago.

25:46.640 --> 25:48.301
Are you all right, Mom?

25:48.340 --> 25:52.174
Too many hours in court.

25:52.210 --> 25:54.917
(inhales)
How are you?

25:54.950 --> 25:56.770
I'm good.

25:56.820 --> 25:59.141
And how's Connor?
Connor?

25:59.190 --> 26:00.919
He's good, I guess. Why?

26:00.960 --> 26:02.313
Tell me about him.

26:02.360 --> 26:04.328
About Connor?

26:04.360 --> 26:06.624
I-I don't know--
I already did.

26:06.660 --> 26:07.854
No...

26:07.900 --> 26:09.299
I only know that you...

26:09.330 --> 26:10.968
go to the same school

26:11.000 --> 26:14.936
and that his girlfriend
was the one who did that...

26:14.970 --> 26:17.029
Not his girlfriend--
they broke up.

26:17.070 --> 26:19.300
Okay, um...

26:19.340 --> 26:20.364
Tell me about him.

26:20.410 --> 26:23.334
Okay. Uh, well, he's nice.

26:23.380 --> 26:26.804
Um, he wants to live
in Thailand.

26:26.850 --> 26:28.670
There's this one city
in Thailand

26:28.720 --> 26:31.211
where, um, they have a festival
once a year

26:31.250 --> 26:33.138
and basically everyone throws
water at each other.

26:33.190 --> 26:35.249
So, it's like
this massive

26:35.290 --> 26:37.087
citywide water fight.
(laughs)

26:37.120 --> 26:41.056
And-and he wants to do
that after school?

26:41.100 --> 26:42.397
Well, just for a year.

26:42.430 --> 26:44.819
Ah.
And then he'll
go to college.

26:49.400 --> 26:52.335
So, you two have gotten close?

26:52.370 --> 26:54.179
Just as friends.

26:54.210 --> 26:56.337
And he's
a Christian, too?

26:56.380 --> 26:58.678
No.
But you are?

26:58.710 --> 27:00.814
You're still a Christian?
You don't have to
say "a Christian."

27:00.850 --> 27:02.215
You can just say "Christian."

27:02.250 --> 27:04.787
And, yeah. Why?

27:07.690 --> 27:11.319
You used the hard line
on my desktop computer?

27:11.360 --> 27:13.055
Yeah.

27:13.090 --> 27:14.296
Someone did
a search there.

27:14.330 --> 27:17.390
Trying to find out about...
something.

27:17.430 --> 27:18.829
What?

27:18.870 --> 27:20.861
(sighs)

27:23.270 --> 27:24.100
Condoms.

27:24.140 --> 27:26.404
Oh, my God, Mom!

27:26.440 --> 27:27.998
I didn't know...
I didn't know if it was you.

27:28.040 --> 27:30.679
Oh, no!
And if it was,
it is not a problem.

27:30.710 --> 27:32.974
But I think maybe we
should talk about it.
You really think I'd use

27:33.010 --> 27:34.716
your computer
to find out about condoms?

27:34.750 --> 27:36.445
I didn't know.
We haven't had a talk.

27:36.480 --> 27:38.414
Because I don't want to.
Well, maybe

27:38.450 --> 27:40.088
We need to have it now.
No, Mom.

27:40.120 --> 27:41.314
No, thanks, really.

27:41.360 --> 27:43.316
I really don't want to.

27:50.800 --> 27:52.791
You okay?

27:52.830 --> 27:54.036
Yeah.

27:55.470 --> 27:57.267
And you're being a good girl?

27:57.300 --> 27:58.938
I'm being a good girl.

27:58.970 --> 28:01.177
Okay, good.

28:01.210 --> 28:04.043
I'm here if you need to talk.

28:09.480 --> 28:13.189
Brock Dalyndro--
D-A-L-Y-N-D-R-O.
HELLINGER:
And did you attend

28:13.220 --> 28:16.053
the Alt-O-Rama concert
last May?
Yeah.

28:16.090 --> 28:17.955
All three days--
it was killer.

28:17.990 --> 28:19.480
Could you please
tell us what you saw?

28:19.530 --> 28:21.350
I was coming back
to the campsite,

28:21.400 --> 28:25.291
Sabbath had just finished their
set, and my head was ringing.

28:25.330 --> 28:28.367
And, uh, I saw a guy coming out
with a blanket

28:28.400 --> 28:31.733
over his shoulder, putting it
into the trunk of a car.

28:31.770 --> 28:33.067
How far away were you
from this man?

28:33.110 --> 28:35.772
Maybe ten, 15 feet.
So, close enough
to see

28:35.810 --> 28:36.777
there was something
in the blanket?

28:36.810 --> 28:38.141
Objection, leading.

28:38.180 --> 28:40.375
Sustained.
Why did you notice
this blanket?

28:40.410 --> 28:41.946
Well, I saw
what looked

28:41.980 --> 28:43.379
like a body in it.

28:43.420 --> 28:44.739
From the way he
was carrying it.
Objection,

28:44.790 --> 28:46.815
speculation.
Sustained.

28:46.850 --> 28:49.080
Do you recognize that man you
saw in this room today, Brock?

28:49.120 --> 28:51.452
Yeah... him.

28:51.490 --> 28:53.219
The witness is pointing
to the defendant,

28:53.260 --> 28:55.820
Troy Mallick.
Nothing further.

28:55.860 --> 28:57.919
(quietly):
Try getting out of that one.

28:59.030 --> 29:02.397
Mr. Dalyndro,
had you been drinking

29:02.440 --> 29:03.532
the night of the concert?

29:03.570 --> 29:05.128
I had a few beers,
I guess.

29:05.170 --> 29:06.467
A few-- how many is that?

29:06.510 --> 29:09.035
Maybe seven or eight?

29:09.080 --> 29:10.775
Okay, you done any drugs?

29:13.550 --> 29:15.939
I might've smoked
a little pot, but...

29:15.980 --> 29:18.187
But-but it wasn't mine though.
Uh-huh.

29:18.220 --> 29:20.916
Uh-huh, so
you smoked pot,

29:20.960 --> 29:22.814
you drank seven or eight beers,

29:22.860 --> 29:24.953
it was dark out,
crowded, noisy...

29:24.990 --> 29:26.252
Yeah, but I know
what I saw.
You saw

29:26.290 --> 29:27.894
a man carrying a blanket?
Yeah.

29:27.930 --> 29:28.726
With a mountain on it.

29:28.760 --> 29:30.967
I'm sorry, what?
The blanket, it...

29:31.000 --> 29:32.558
it had this mountain peak on it.

29:32.600 --> 29:34.932
I see.
That seems to be a new detail.

29:34.970 --> 29:37.029
You never mentioned
that to the police.
Well, I never

29:37.070 --> 29:38.401
thought of it till now.
Uh-huh.

29:38.440 --> 29:40.567
And what else might you think
of in another week's time?

29:40.610 --> 29:42.874
Objection.
Sustained.

29:42.910 --> 29:44.969
Now, let's turn to
your identification
of this mysterious man.

29:45.010 --> 29:48.138
Your Honor,
may we approach the bench?

29:48.180 --> 29:49.943
Excuse me, Ms. Hellinger,
I'm in the midst of questioning.

29:49.980 --> 29:52.210
Your Honor?
Please approach.

29:56.590 --> 29:58.228
(whispering): Your Honor,
it gives me no delight

29:58.260 --> 30:00.285
in saying this, but I believe
the defense is prepared

30:00.330 --> 30:01.592
to contravene your ruling.

30:01.630 --> 30:03.825
What?
Mr. Gardner intends
to show

30:03.870 --> 30:06.327
this witness a photo of a man
wearing an identical shirt

30:06.370 --> 30:08.588
to trick him into IDing him
as the killer,

30:08.640 --> 30:11.507
then reveal it's, in fact,
the accused in Minooka.

30:11.540 --> 30:13.838
Uh... what?
How do you know this,

30:13.880 --> 30:14.938
ASA Hellinger?

30:14.980 --> 30:16.299
Yes, how do
you know this?

30:16.340 --> 30:17.876
I don't, Your Honor,

30:17.910 --> 30:19.605
but I've caught on
to Mr. Gardner's tricks.

30:19.650 --> 30:23.108
This is just outrageous.
I believe that
that photo

30:23.150 --> 30:24.412
there on the defense table

30:24.450 --> 30:26.418
is, in fact,
the Minooka defendant.

30:26.450 --> 30:28.987
Let's see it, Mr. Gardner.

30:29.020 --> 30:31.625
Your Honor...
Let's see it.

30:31.660 --> 30:32.979
Let's see it.

30:35.900 --> 30:37.891
Okay, here-here's the thing.

30:37.930 --> 30:39.261
Yes, it's that photo,

30:39.300 --> 30:41.188
but the real
galling thing here

30:41.240 --> 30:43.196
is that the jury will
never be allowed to know

30:43.240 --> 30:46.129
that Minooka killer could be
easily confused for my client.

30:46.170 --> 30:47.467
Yes, thank you.

30:47.510 --> 30:49.978
That's ten more thousand dollars
in contempt fines,

30:50.010 --> 30:52.001
Mr. Gardner,
now, step back.

30:54.980 --> 30:59.019
What does it feel like
to be so predictable?

30:59.050 --> 31:01.951
* There's a little ol' house

31:02.990 --> 31:04.924
* At the top of the hill

31:05.960 --> 31:07.621
* At the end of the road

31:07.660 --> 31:12.495
* There's a little ol' _man
With a demon to kill *

31:12.530 --> 31:16.136
* Well, he's hiding with her

31:16.170 --> 31:18.968
(tires squealing)
* Yeah, he's over the blues

31:20.410 --> 31:23.004
* Jebidiah Moonshine's
Friday night shack party *

31:23.040 --> 31:25.008
* Shake your thing and swing

31:25.050 --> 31:27.200
* What you bringin'
to the party? *

31:27.250 --> 31:28.911
(grunts)
* Nonstoppin', keep on boppin'

31:28.950 --> 31:30.918
* Till we droppin' everybody

31:30.950 --> 31:34.181
* Jebidiah Moonshine's
Friday night shack party *

31:34.220 --> 31:36.609
* Down, down, get down,
get down, down, get down *

31:36.660 --> 31:37.979
* We're going up *

31:38.030 --> 31:40.225
* Attention all party scouts

31:40.260 --> 31:41.488
* We're going up *

31:41.530 --> 31:43.657
* Raise two fingers in the air

31:43.700 --> 31:45.065
* We're going up *

31:45.100 --> 31:46.294
* And repeat after me

31:46.330 --> 31:48.935
* We're going on a party hunt

31:48.970 --> 31:51.029
* We're going on
a party hunt *

31:51.070 --> 31:52.662
* We're gonna get a big one

31:52.710 --> 31:55.076
* We're gonna get
a big one *

31:55.110 --> 31:57.032
* We're not scared!
* We're not scared *

31:57.080 --> 32:00.572
* That's right,
we ain't scared of nothin' *

32:00.610 --> 32:01.679
(groans)

32:01.720 --> 32:04.086
Tell Nick I'll be at work.

32:04.120 --> 32:06.338
It's time to end this.

32:06.390 --> 32:07.516
* Yeah!

32:11.730 --> 32:14.153
I learned my second piece
Mr. Gold, "Danny Boy."

32:14.200 --> 32:16.498
Congratulations.

32:16.530 --> 32:18.964
The accordion.
At first,
I thought,

32:19.000 --> 32:21.093
who plays the accordion,
but then I kind of liked it.

32:21.140 --> 32:22.732
It's unusual.
Mm.

32:22.770 --> 32:24.465
The Fed who plays
the accordion.

32:24.510 --> 32:26.330
That's right.

32:26.370 --> 32:28.531
We've looked into Wooster-Graff
Industries donations

32:28.580 --> 32:30.502
to Vanessa Gold.

32:30.540 --> 32:32.644
I'm sorry, do you want
to talk more about accordions?

32:32.680 --> 32:35.547
No,done.
We've looked
into the donations

32:35.580 --> 32:37.468
to Vanessa Gold's campaign,
and we feel confident

32:37.520 --> 32:39.283
that Eli has done nothing wrong.

32:39.320 --> 32:41.311
Well, that's great.
Phew.

32:41.360 --> 32:43.612
But given that
Mr. Gold's

32:43.660 --> 32:45.981
campaigns are highly visible,
we want to know

32:46.030 --> 32:47.998
how we can satisfy
the Justice Department's

32:48.030 --> 32:50.225
insatiable appetite
for information.

32:50.260 --> 32:51.989
A proffer.

32:52.030 --> 32:53.122
As to what?

32:53.170 --> 32:54.660
Indiscretions by the candidate.

32:54.700 --> 32:56.497
I'm not gonna turn
on my ex-wife.
No.

32:56.540 --> 32:58.508
Peter Florrick.

32:58.540 --> 33:01.077
You're accusing
Mr. Gold

33:01.110 --> 33:03.601
of soliciting illegal donations
for Peter Florrick?
o.

33:03.640 --> 33:07.474
But we would be willing to drop
any charges against Mr. Gold

33:07.510 --> 33:10.343
in trade for a proffer
on Mr. Florrick.

33:13.190 --> 33:14.657
Go to hell.

33:14.690 --> 33:15.714
I would
adVIse you

33:15.760 --> 33:19.025
to talk things over
with your lawyer, Mr. Gold.

33:19.060 --> 33:22.029
I'd imagine she'd urge patience.

33:22.060 --> 33:25.393
After he cools down,
have him give me a call.

33:25.430 --> 33:27.022
Go to hell.

33:27.070 --> 33:28.230
WIL|__:
He's lying.

33:28.270 --> 33:30.465
Making up details--
a mountain on a blanket.

33:30.500 --> 33:32.104
KALINDA:
I don't think he was lying.

33:32.140 --> 33:35.200
Troy's company is called
WaterCleanse.

33:35.240 --> 33:37.105
It's a home-filtering
water company.

33:37.140 --> 33:38.300
And that

33:38.350 --> 33:40.648
is their logo.
WILL:
I'm not sure what...

33:40.680 --> 33:42.477
Turn it upside down.

33:44.220 --> 33:46.586
There's your mountain.

33:46.620 --> 33:47.644
It was on a
blanket, not a...

33:52.460 --> 33:53.722
Our client is guilty.

33:53.760 --> 33:55.455
We don't know that.

33:55.500 --> 33:56.626
You're right, we don't.

33:56.660 --> 33:58.628
And either way,
we have a duty to

33:58.670 --> 33:59.762
zealously represent our clients.

33:59.800 --> 34:02.132
What about the defendant
in Minooka?
What about him?

34:02.170 --> 34:04.058
I've been helping
the prosecution
convict an innocent man.

34:04.110 --> 34:06.362
No, you've been supplying
the prosecution with

34:06.410 --> 34:08.207
true information to
help them Win a case.

34:08.240 --> 34:09.502
Yes. Against
an innocent man.

34:09.540 --> 34:11.349
So what do I do?

34:11.380 --> 34:13.302
Out there in Minooka?

34:13.350 --> 34:15.409
Do I continue to help them
convict a man

34:15.450 --> 34:17.418
_ I know is innocent _
in order to represent my client

34:17.450 --> 34:18.610
who I know is not?

34:18.650 --> 34:22.313
We have to zealously represent
the interests of our client.

34:22.360 --> 34:23.850
It's our job.

34:23.890 --> 34:25.255
We can hate it,

34:25.290 --> 34:26.257
but it's our job.

34:29.260 --> 34:30.693
HOFF:
And that's why your office

34:30.730 --> 34:32.129
never considered my client
a suspect?

34:32.170 --> 34:33.091
MATAN:
Yes.

34:33.130 --> 34:34.495
There was too much real evidence

34:34.540 --> 34:36.292
to support our suspect
in Chicago.

34:36.340 --> 34:38.365
The trace evidence from
the victi\r(n's dress...
es.

34:39.710 --> 34:41.109
(whispering):
Anything else?

34:41.140 --> 34:42.539
MATAN:
...but it was
a damning picture.

34:42.580 --> 34:44.309
Go for Tillman.
HOFF:
Nothing further, Your Honor.

34:46.150 --> 34:49.176
Mr. Brody,
you are quite confident

34:49.220 --> 34:51.415
that your defendant
in Chicago

34:51.450 --> 34:53.816
is the person responsible
for this crime.

34:53.850 --> 34:55.317
Yes, sir.

34:55.360 --> 34:56.657
And were you equally confident

34:56.690 --> 34:59.181
with the Ryan Tillman
murder case?

35:01.860 --> 35:03.327
That wasn't my fault.
Yes.

35:03.360 --> 35:05.794
But were you equally confident?

35:05.830 --> 35:07.263
Objection, Your Honor,
relevance.

35:07.300 --> 35:08.267
What is this case?

35:08.300 --> 35:09.232
A murder that
Mr. Brody prosecuted

35:09.270 --> 35:11.409
that sent a man to prison

35:11.440 --> 35:13.431
for... ten years.

35:13.470 --> 35:15.301
He was recently exonerated.

35:15.340 --> 35:17.376
No, Alma, I will allow.

35:17.410 --> 35:18.775
It goes to credibility.

35:18.810 --> 35:20.243
TRIPKE: _
Were you equally confident

35:20.280 --> 35:22.714
prosecuting Mr. Tillman?

35:58.390 --> 35:59.687
(sighs)

35:59.720 --> 36:01.256
Okay.

36:01.290 --> 36:02.689
You have another problem.

36:02.720 --> 36:04.256
Just one?
That was the employer

36:04.290 --> 36:06.178
of the defendant in Minooka.

36:06.230 --> 36:08.198
It's a landscaping company,

36:08.230 --> 36:10.198
and it uses the same
soil treatment

36:10.230 --> 36:11.322
as the concert campground.

36:11.370 --> 36:13.588
Yeah.

36:13.630 --> 36:15.530
So... the soil on
Gary Kuharski's shoes

36:15.570 --> 36:18.232
was probably from his work site.

36:18.270 --> 36:19.703
So I gave the prosecution
inaccurate evidence.

36:21.540 --> 36:22.939
And I can't tell them, can I?

36:22.980 --> 36:23.935
Well...

36:23.980 --> 36:25.208
it'll become public record.

36:25.250 --> 36:28.378
And then the state's attorney
could use it against our client.

36:28.420 --> 36:30.376
Yep.
So I have to
keep my mouth shut,

36:30.420 --> 36:31.887
while an innocent man
may go to jail.

36:31.920 --> 36:33.217
It's one of
those dilemmas

36:33.250 --> 36:35.309
that doesn't come up
in law school.

36:35.360 --> 36:37.385
No. No, we can't win
without downstate anymore.

36:37.420 --> 36:39.524
We need to hit Maddie
right in her base of su...

36:39.560 --> 36:40.686
(knocking on door)
Yeah?

36:40.730 --> 36:43.858
Um, Mr. Gold,
you better come out here.

36:47.900 --> 36:49.538
You're gonna want to seize
the hard drives,

36:49.570 --> 36:50.969
all the cell phones.

36:51.000 --> 36:52.536
Someone's got to get started
on those files over there.

36:52.570 --> 36:54.538
Hi, Mr. Gold.
So good to see you again.

36:54.580 --> 36:56.275
What the hell are you doing?

36:56.310 --> 36:58.778
We are raiding your office.

36:58.810 --> 37:01.517
You're gonna want to wrap up
that call right now.

37:01.550 --> 37:03.370
Over there. Yep.

37:03.420 --> 37:04.717
Shut it down,
shut it down.

37:04.750 --> 37:06.786
You can keep your coffee.
Yeah, print.

37:06.820 --> 37:08.754
Hang it up.
Hang it up right now.

37:08.790 --> 37:09.950
You, too, bud.

37:17.400 --> 37:19.391
Hey, Mom?
Mm.
Hey, I am running late.

37:19.430 --> 37:21.398
I was thinking about what
happened with your computer,

37:21.440 --> 37:24.329
so I ran a cache search.

37:24.370 --> 37:25.803
Um, sometimes if you haven't
cleared your cache,

37:25.840 --> 37:27.705
you can tell when a certain
search was run.

37:27.740 --> 37:30.334
Well, I can pretty much say
I've never cleaned my cache.

37:30.380 --> 37:32.405
It was Thanksgiving night.

37:32.450 --> 37:34.338
8:12 pm.
That's when the search was run.

37:34.380 --> 37:37.269
Well, we were
all here then.
Yeah, we were, but...

37:37.320 --> 37:38.685
Here, look at this.

37:38.720 --> 37:40.017
Two minutes before,

37:40.050 --> 37:42.814
the browser logged into
that e-mail page.

37:42.860 --> 37:43.918
Which means...?

37:43.960 --> 37:45.757
That's Grandma's e-mail page.

37:46.790 --> 37:48.519
My mom's?
No.

37:48.560 --> 37:49.697
Jackie's.

37:52.730 --> 37:54.937
I...

37:54.970 --> 37:56.597
Uh, so you're saying she...

38:02.840 --> 38:03.977
Zach?

38:04.010 --> 38:05.500
Yeah?

38:05.550 --> 38:07.074
We never speak of this again.

38:07.110 --> 38:09.578
I'm good with that.

38:09.620 --> 38:11.440
Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury,

38:11.490 --> 38:12.912
I understand you have
reached a verdict.

38:12.950 --> 38:14.986
FOREMAN:
Yes, we have, Your Honor.

38:16.360 --> 38:18.828
(paper rustling)

38:23.400 --> 38:25.322
Very well.

38:25.370 --> 38:28.498
Would you read the verdict,
please, Mr. Foreman?

38:31.540 --> 38:32.768
JUDGE:
In the matter of

38:32.810 --> 38:35.506
The People of the State of
Illinois v. Gary L. Kuharski,

38:35.540 --> 38:37.508
on the charge
of first degree murder,

38:37.540 --> 38:39.599
we the jury find
the defendant...

38:39.650 --> 38:40.844
...guilty.

38:40.880 --> 38:41.847
(gallery exclaims)

38:41.880 --> 38:43.472
...guilty.

38:43.520 --> 38:45.442
(gallery murmuring)

38:52.530 --> 38:54.521
(gavel banging)

38:58.060 --> 39:00.324
(music playing)

39:07.570 --> 39:10.903
You heading out?

39:10.940 --> 39:12.840
Well, I was thinking about it.

39:12.880 --> 39:14.438
I think I owe you.

39:14.480 --> 39:16.448
Okay.

39:19.990 --> 39:21.787
You were good.

39:21.820 --> 39:23.549
Thank you.

39:23.590 --> 39:24.955
You were, too.

39:24.990 --> 39:26.753
It's tough to get them off
when they're guilty.

39:26.790 --> 39:29.395
Let's agree to disagree.

39:29.430 --> 39:32.422
Either way, tough break
for the guy in Minooka.

39:34.800 --> 39:36.597
Our case is over.

39:36.640 --> 39:38.164
Our guy got convicted.

39:38.200 --> 39:40.839
Meaning...?

39:40.870 --> 39:42.770
Our duty's discharged.

39:42.810 --> 39:44.402
So if we have anything

39:44.450 --> 39:46.406
that could help that
guy on his appeal...

39:46.450 --> 39:47.599
we can use it.

39:48.450 --> 39:50.441
Okay.

39:51.650 --> 39:52.617
To the next one.

39:52.650 --> 39:54.652
I can't wait.

40:07.070 --> 40:09.061
(elevator bell dings,
door opening)

40:19.480 --> 40:23.109
NICK:
You know, the next time
you want to get my attention,

40:23.150 --> 40:24.708
just give me a call.

40:24.750 --> 40:26.638
There won't be
a next time.

40:28.490 --> 40:30.651
Why's that?

40:30.690 --> 40:32.988
'Cause you're leaving.
Am I?

40:33.030 --> 40:35.590
Where am I goin'?

40:35.630 --> 40:37.450
I just made a call
to the police

40:37.500 --> 40:40.663
about your tow truck operation
smuggling drugs.

40:50.610 --> 40:53.499
That's a shame.

40:54.550 --> 40:56.518
Cops are already
at the yard, Nick.

40:56.550 --> 40:57.949
It's too late.

40:59.890 --> 41:03.610
There's nothing here
for you anymore.

41:03.660 --> 41:04.888
So your best bet...

41:04.930 --> 41:06.921
is to cross the border here.

41:08.930 --> 41:11.524
And here's a key...

41:11.570 --> 41:14.596
to a locker at
the Point Edward bus station.

41:14.640 --> 41:16.631
I placed half
my $20,000 there.

41:16.670 --> 41:19.503
I want you to take it,

41:19.540 --> 41:21.007
and go.

41:23.810 --> 41:24.902
You know
there's nothing left

41:24.950 --> 41:28.101
between us, Nick.

41:28.150 --> 41:30.141
Nothing.

41:32.690 --> 41:34.954
So why don't you get
the hell out of here?

41:36.990 --> 41:39.754
I don't think
you did call the cops.

41:39.790 --> 41:41.792
That's not your style.

41:44.630 --> 41:45.597
So...

41:45.630 --> 41:47.621
what's your plan B?

42:00.810 --> 42:04.849
* Ah, ah... ah

42:09.190 --> 42:14.025
* With your feet in the air,
your head on the ground *

42:14.060 --> 42:16.199
(phone keys beeping)

42:16.230 --> 42:18.562
Kalinda, I'm just wondering
where you are.

42:18.600 --> 42:20.124
Give me a call.

42:20.170 --> 42:21.068
* Yeah

42:21.100 --> 42:22.237
KALIN DA:
What did I miss?

42:22.270 --> 42:25.569
* Your head will collapse
if there's nothing in it *

42:25.610 --> 42:27.760
Oh. Not much.
Where were you?

42:27.810 --> 42:30.199
Out.

42:30.240 --> 42:31.969
* Where is my mind?

42:32.010 --> 42:33.102
* Where is
my mind? *

42:33.150 --> 42:35.118
You look relieved.

42:35.150 --> 42:37.277
I am.
He's gone?

42:39.120 --> 42:41.987
And you're safe?

42:42.020 --> 42:44.056
Yeah.

42:44.090 --> 42:45.284
You are, too.

42:46.330 --> 42:49.128
Good.

42:49.160 --> 42:51.196
What if he comes back?

42:53.230 --> 42:55.061
He's not coming back.

42:55.100 --> 42:58.228
You sure?

42:58.270 --> 43:01.000
Yeah.

43:04.180 --> 43:07.206
* Ah, ah, ah...
