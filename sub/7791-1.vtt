57:14.814 --> 57:15.940
- They're white.
- They're white.

through 30 years at that factory.

Eagle fans are not happy
with the decision to punt,

01:34:57.874 --> 01:35:00.468
but Vermeil,
not taking any chances here.

01:35:00.544 --> 01:35:02.444
Now hoping for overtime.

Watch for the Giants
to go for the block.

COMMENTATOR:
It appears the Eagles

01:35:38.548 --> 01:35:39.606

changing the play.

01:36:33.337 --> 01:36:36.033
- Papale's at the 40.
- Come on, Vince.

01:36:36.106 --> 01:36:39.564
The 30. The 20. The 10.

01:36:43.613 --> 01:36:45.581
- Oh, my God.
- Go, go, go!

01:36:45.649 --> 01:36:46.741
