Sorry, George,

01:47.441 --> 01:49.308
but Pancake Wednesday

01:49.310 --> 01:51.143
I... I don't have time

Don't play with your food,
George.

03:58.872 --> 04:00.672
Be a good little monkey
while I'm gone.

04:00.674 --> 04:02.608

George?

Aah!

04:34.708 --> 04:36.174
Uh-oh.

04:38.712 --> 04:42.447
George, you can't just do whatever
you want, whenever you want.

04:42.449 --> 04:44.983
Oh. Oh, okay.

04:46.453 --> 04:51.490
Now, I have an
appointment with my shower. Again.

05:02.303 --> 05:04.136
<i>...and next
time, we'll explore</i>

05:04.138 --> 05:06.872
<i>secrets of
the mighty Triceratops.</i>

05:09.109 --> 05:11.610
<i>Hey! Do you want to
have fun?</i>

05:11.612 --> 05:14.946
- Huh?
- <i>Do whatever you want, whenever you want?</i>

05:14.948 --> 05:16.915
Ah!

05:16.917 --> 05:21.987
<i>Then come on over to Castleland
and live like royalty!</i>

05:21.989 --> 05:26.325
- Ooh.
<i>- You can plunge down the Spiral Staircase...</i>

05:26.327 --> 05:29.628
- Ah.
- <i>...spin on the Swinging Chandelier...</i>

05:29.630 --> 05:33.932
- Ooh.
- <i>...or jump on Ye Old Water Wheel.</i>

05:33.934 --> 05:37.202
Aha!

05:37.204 --> 05:39.838
<i>You can even ride
noble horses.</i>

05:41.775 --> 05:44.276
<i>Enjoy making messes? Go ahead.</i>

05:44.278 --> 05:46.611
<i>Partake in
a raucous medieval feast.</i>

05:49.550 --> 05:53.118
Listen, George,
I'm sorry I got angry.

05:55.789 --> 05:59.391
It's just... I was asked to take
over this important meeting.

05:59.393 --> 06:01.593
I'm a little unprepared.

06:02.029 --> 06:03.128
Mmm.

06:05.899 --> 06:10.502
Hey, after the meeting, I think we
deserve something fun. What do you say?

06:14.241 --> 06:16.174
<i>Everyone has a coronation,</i>

06:16.176 --> 06:18.944
<i>and every guest
is treated like royalty.</i>

06:27.187 --> 06:32.023
Oh, okay.
Really? Oh, wow. Thanks.

06:32.025 --> 06:33.692
All right,
I'll see you at the museum.

06:33.694 --> 06:37.496
We're in luck, George.
My friend, Sophie, works at Castleland,

06:37.498 --> 06:39.431
and we're going to be
her guests.

06:39.433 --> 06:42.200
- Huh?
- Yeah.

06:42.202 --> 06:44.002
She's gonna pick us up
right after my meeting.

06:44.004 --> 06:46.037
So you're coming with me
to the museum.

06:52.012 --> 06:54.679
But you need to be
on your best behavior.

06:58.285 --> 07:00.018
Oh. Mm-hmm.

07:15.469 --> 07:18.470
Ooh, horses.

07:18.472 --> 07:22.707
Your Monkeyness, isn't it
wonderful to be out of the castle?

07:28.148 --> 07:31.082
Well, I think it's fun
to be out with everybody.

07:31.084 --> 07:33.385
Philippe has a point,
Isabel.

07:33.387 --> 07:36.721
Nothing good comes from
mixing with the common folk.

07:36.723 --> 07:39.157
Now, Ana, can you please...

07:39.159 --> 07:43.128
Fill you in on our host?
Of course. Just...

07:43.130 --> 07:45.931
over here.
Here he is, Your Majesty.

07:45.933 --> 07:49.501
We'll see the Simiana Exhibit,
and then he'll give us a brief tour.

07:50.938 --> 07:54.639
Hmm. Do you really think
a man wearing a hat like that

07:54.641 --> 07:56.508
can be trusted
to take care of our...

07:56.510 --> 07:58.477
Precious artifacts?

07:58.479 --> 08:00.745
Well, he looks a little bit...

08:00.747 --> 08:03.582
unusual,
but as you know,

08:03.584 --> 08:05.784
the royal family's popularity
among the people

08:05.786 --> 08:08.787
is at an all-time low.

08:08.789 --> 08:12.290
- Hmm.
- However,

08:12.292 --> 08:16.461
this exhibit, combined with Princess
Isabel's upcoming coronation,

08:16.463 --> 08:18.830
is sure to
bring you back on top.

08:20.167 --> 08:22.033
I hope so.

08:23.604 --> 08:25.036
For Isabel's sake.

08:37.851 --> 08:40.852
Papa! Look.

08:41.855 --> 08:43.855
Hmph.

08:43.857 --> 08:47.292
Isabel, you know music
is simply not dignified.

08:47.294 --> 08:49.895
And certainly not appropriate
for royalty.

08:51.064 --> 08:52.564
Yes, Papa.

09:04.878 --> 09:06.044
Quick, George.
I can't be late.

09:10.517 --> 09:13.652
Hey, George.
Love the crown.

09:13.654 --> 09:15.820
Ah. Ah.

09:18.258 --> 09:21.493
Lots of royalty
coming through today.

09:21.495 --> 09:25.096
Don't tell me the King
of Simiana's already here.

09:25.098 --> 09:29.067
Judge for yourself.
Isn't he kingly?

09:29.670 --> 09:30.936
Oh, brother.

09:34.775 --> 09:36.341
Ooh.

09:38.712 --> 09:40.946
Oh, ah.

09:40.948 --> 09:42.647
Come on.
This way, George.

09:48.589 --> 09:52.424
George, stay right here
and don't move a muscle.

09:52.426 --> 09:55.293
As soon as I'm done,
we're off to Castleland. Okay?

10:02.469 --> 10:04.936
Oh.

10:08.075 --> 10:10.108
Huh.

10:13.380 --> 10:14.512
Hmm.

10:19.586 --> 10:20.652
Ah...

10:20.654 --> 10:22.554
Uh, um...

10:22.556 --> 10:24.222
Your Highest Highness.

10:24.224 --> 10:26.958
Wait, no, no.
That's wrong.

10:26.960 --> 10:29.127
- Uh... Mmm.
- Um, Your Majesty's Royal...

10:29.129 --> 10:31.529
No, no, no, no.
That's off, that's off...

10:34.434 --> 10:36.868
Wow, it's a miniature version
of home.

10:39.106 --> 10:41.206
And they have a copy
of our Book of Customs.

10:43.310 --> 10:45.410
And our host?

10:46.647 --> 10:48.380
Only three minutes late.

10:49.850 --> 10:52.651
Tardiness is not
one of our honored customs.

10:52.653 --> 10:56.388
I'm here! I'm here.
So sorry I'm late.

10:58.158 --> 11:01.926
Welcome to
our Royal Treasures exhibit.

11:01.928 --> 11:05.764
Your privilege.
It's a great Majesty...

11:05.766 --> 11:10.035
No, no, no, I mean, I mean,
it's a great Highness... Ah... I, ooh...

11:11.805 --> 11:14.272
May I introduce
his Royal Majesty,

11:14.274 --> 11:17.842
King Gustavo Hernando
Fernando Heraldo V.

11:17.844 --> 11:23.581
And the Princess Isabel Hortensia
Florencia III, of the kingdom of Simiana.

11:24.551 --> 11:29.187
Uh... Ted.
I'm Ted... the first.

11:32.325 --> 11:34.559
Oh, is that...

11:34.561 --> 11:37.562
The most precious artifact
in all of Simiana,

11:37.564 --> 11:40.065
which the king has graciously
loaned to your museum?

11:41.334 --> 11:42.667
Yes.

11:42.669 --> 11:45.336
A monkey. Incredible.

11:45.338 --> 11:47.639
The monkey
is our national symbol.

11:47.641 --> 11:49.240
- It is?
- Yes.

11:49.242 --> 11:52.577
Centuries ago,
one saved a young king's life.

11:52.579 --> 11:55.013
We treat them
like royalty.

11:55.015 --> 11:57.115
Oh, that's amazing.

12:00.353 --> 12:06.257
I happen to be very fond of monkeys too.
Well, one in particular.

12:06.259 --> 12:10.662
How fascinating.
As you can see, our Philippe...

12:12.232 --> 12:15.133
Ana, where's Philippe?

12:29.216 --> 12:30.648
Yuck.

12:36.790 --> 12:37.989
Argh.

12:55.208 --> 12:56.374
Huh?

13:13.260 --> 13:14.125
Oh.

13:16.463 --> 13:20.331
Ah. Oh? Ah.

13:26.473 --> 13:30.341
Oh. Ooh.

13:40.320 --> 13:41.920
Aw. Hmm.

13:46.693 --> 13:48.259
Uh-oh!

13:57.938 --> 13:59.037
Whoa.

14:01.374 --> 14:02.874
Hey!

14:06.513 --> 14:08.613
Ooh, ooh.

14:14.988 --> 14:17.455
And don't worry
about a thing.

14:17.457 --> 14:21.192
If there's one thing I know
how to take care of, it's a...

14:22.162 --> 14:23.661
Monkey?

14:23.663 --> 14:25.864
Oh! Whoa! Uh, oh!

14:32.639 --> 14:34.539
What just happened?

14:36.643 --> 14:38.042
Nothing.

14:43.183 --> 14:46.918
I mean, nothing
that will ever happen again.

14:48.321 --> 14:49.754
Hmph.

14:49.756 --> 14:53.491
Uh, I can see you're upset.

14:53.493 --> 14:57.028
So... let me just, um...

14:57.030 --> 14:59.030
show you
all the museum's devices

14:59.032 --> 15:01.866
which will keep
your precious artifact safe.

15:01.868 --> 15:03.568
But first,
I just need one minute.

15:06.439 --> 15:10.341
Ugh.
This is a disaster.

15:10.343 --> 15:14.712
I've changed my mind.
The exhibition is off.

15:14.714 --> 15:16.347
Oh, I understand,
Your Majesty,

15:16.349 --> 15:20.118
but perhaps we could just
give them a second chance.

15:20.120 --> 15:24.088
Giving second chances is not an
honored custom. We're leaving.

15:31.464 --> 15:33.064
- George?
- Ooh?

15:33.066 --> 15:35.333
You were supposed to
stay in the office.

15:40.040 --> 15:43.875
Hi. Sophie, Ted here.
I need a huge favor.

15:44.911 --> 15:46.477
- Doris?
- Hmm?

15:46.479 --> 15:49.480
Can you watch George until the
car from Castleland gets here?

15:49.482 --> 15:51.549
My friend Sophie
is picking him up.

15:51.551 --> 15:54.452
Check. I'm on it.

15:54.454 --> 15:57.322
George, I have to stay here
and straighten things out.

15:57.324 --> 15:59.924
So you stay with Doris
until Sophie gets here.

15:59.926 --> 16:02.860
I'll come to Castleland as soon as I
can, all right?

16:06.466 --> 16:08.666
I printed out
this Castleland brochure.

16:08.668 --> 16:10.301
You can study all the rides
on your trip.

16:11.171 --> 16:13.037
Ooh.

16:14.240 --> 16:15.807
Now, be a good little monkey.

16:16.309 --> 16:17.408
Bye.

16:19.346 --> 16:20.745
And I need...

16:20.747 --> 16:21.913
Your car.
It's on the way.

16:24.751 --> 16:26.517
You're leaving?

16:26.519 --> 16:28.486
Wait.
Can we talk about this?

16:28.488 --> 16:31.189
Good day, Mr...

16:32.592 --> 16:34.225
Man with the Yellow Hat.

16:34.995 --> 16:36.761
Come. We're going home.

16:37.597 --> 16:38.963
But where's Philippe?

16:38.965 --> 16:42.400
Apparently, he had the
good sense to wait outside.

16:56.716 --> 16:59.117
Sophie, I'm really sorry,

16:59.119 --> 17:01.953
but George and I
are gonna have to reschedule.

17:01.955 --> 17:03.821
Huh?

17:03.823 --> 17:04.888
Huh.

17:22.175 --> 17:23.875
Hmm.

17:25.045 --> 17:25.910
Hmm?

17:28.415 --> 17:29.814
Hmph!

17:33.420 --> 17:35.853
Ugh, what was I thinking?

17:35.855 --> 17:38.089
This is what happens
when you take chances.

17:39.225 --> 17:40.958
There you are,
Your Monkeyness.

17:48.201 --> 17:50.068
Oh.

17:56.409 --> 17:57.775
Uh-oh.

17:59.746 --> 18:03.081
Ooh.

18:03.083 --> 18:05.550
Isabel, let me help you out.
Ana, we need to find...

18:05.552 --> 18:06.984
Right away, Your Majesty.

18:09.722 --> 18:11.923
There you are.

18:12.358 --> 18:13.157
Hi.

18:14.194 --> 18:15.526
I hope you weren't hurt.

18:15.528 --> 18:18.863
Oh. Uh-uh.

18:20.100 --> 18:22.533
Oh, my goodness,
where's your vest? Oh.

18:27.874 --> 18:30.108
Oh...

18:30.110 --> 18:32.810
There.
Now you look like yourself.

18:32.812 --> 18:33.878
Uh-huh.

18:36.783 --> 18:39.150
Ready to go back to the Castle,
Your Monkeyness?

18:59.305 --> 19:02.673
Comin'. Hold on.

19:02.675 --> 19:04.008
Hold on.

19:05.812 --> 19:09.147
Doris, what happened?
Please tell me it didn't involve George.

19:09.149 --> 19:11.349
What part don't you
want to know first?

19:11.351 --> 19:14.452
The part where George
climbed on top of the canopy?

19:14.454 --> 19:17.321
Or the part where it fell
right on the royal family?

19:17.323 --> 19:19.657
What? Oh...

19:22.462 --> 19:23.561
George.

19:25.598 --> 19:26.664
Are you okay?

19:26.666 --> 19:28.132
Huh?

19:28.134 --> 19:31.435
The king
and the princess left.

19:31.871 --> 19:33.638
Huh?

19:33.640 --> 19:35.673
Oh, yes, they did.

19:35.675 --> 19:37.909
So the exhibit's off,
and you're coming home with me.

19:39.345 --> 19:40.611
Ugh.

19:40.613 --> 19:43.214
We'll have to go to the castle
another day.

19:43.216 --> 19:45.216
Hmph.

19:45.218 --> 19:47.285
So you're going to give me
the silent treatment?

19:49.322 --> 19:52.590
Well, fine.
But you still need to come with me.

20:26.159 --> 20:28.559
Ah!

20:34.033 --> 20:36.067
Ah. Ooh.

20:38.404 --> 20:40.738
Ah!

20:42.442 --> 20:45.076
What's the matter, Your Monkeyness?
It's time to go.

21:12.272 --> 21:15.706
You know what the problem is?
I've been too nice.

21:15.708 --> 21:18.009
Well, things are going to be
different from now on.

21:22.048 --> 21:24.215
Back from the castle already?

21:26.452 --> 21:29.020
Welcome, Your Highness.

21:33.726 --> 21:35.226
Okay.

21:39.432 --> 21:42.366
Chop, chop. We've got
a lot to work on, buddy.

21:47.407 --> 21:49.674
From now on,
you're playing by the rules.

22:06.926 --> 22:07.858
Well...

22:12.632 --> 22:16.634
Okay, then.
I'll be out here.

22:16.636 --> 22:18.669
Looking for
a new museum exhibit.

22:30.717 --> 22:31.849
Ah...

22:34.120 --> 22:37.888
Does Your Monkeyness
require anything else?

22:39.826 --> 22:43.861
Ah...
Nah...

22:44.330 --> 22:46.130
Very well.

23:11.357 --> 23:12.757
Ooh.

23:13.259 --> 23:14.925
Uh-huh!

23:46.392 --> 23:47.491
Ah!

23:51.864 --> 23:53.998
Mmm, mmm!

23:55.034 --> 23:57.768
Ooh! Aha.

24:01.407 --> 24:03.808
Oh. Ah.

24:04.277 --> 24:06.076
Hmph.

24:06.078 --> 24:07.745
I'll take care of this,
Your Majesty.

24:10.550 --> 24:14.018
Your Monkeyness,
I'll take you to your room.

24:20.960 --> 24:22.493
Ooh.

24:28.067 --> 24:31.836
I encourage you to rest, Your Monkeyness.
It's been a long trip.

24:35.775 --> 24:37.975
Oh.

24:52.158 --> 24:53.924

27:06.759 --> 27:11.962
Ah... Your Monkeyness,
shall we proceed to the banquet hall?

27:11.964 --> 27:14.865
Lunch is about to be served.

27:15.635 --> 27:17.735
Ah! Aha!

27:43.829 --> 27:47.865
This, my friend,
is a copy of the Simianan Book of Customs.

27:52.271 --> 27:56.974
Yep, today, you're going to
learn proper eating etiquette.

27:56.976 --> 28:00.611
It says here,
"When sitting down,

28:00.613 --> 28:02.880
take your napkin
and place it on your..."

28:05.051 --> 28:08.719
Yeah. Okay.
That... that was good.

28:09.622 --> 28:10.954
"Don't scoop your food.

28:10.956 --> 28:12.489
The knife can be used

28:12.491 --> 28:14.625
to help guide food
onto your fork.

28:17.363 --> 28:20.898
And avoid placing your elbows
on the table at all times."

28:27.807 --> 28:29.273
Huh.

28:35.915 --> 28:37.915
This is harder
than I thought.

28:39.752 --> 28:41.652
"And finally,
when you're done,

28:41.654 --> 28:43.253
don't forget to use
your napkin."

28:46.025 --> 28:49.827
Wow. Look who joined
the Clean Plate Club.

28:56.001 --> 28:59.036
And the Clean Table Club.

28:59.038 --> 29:00.971
We should have done this
a long time ago.

29:13.385 --> 29:15.986
Ah! Ah.

29:20.893 --> 29:22.092
Ah.

29:26.465 --> 29:28.766
Lunch is served.

29:31.537 --> 29:32.936
Wow.

29:35.641 --> 29:37.141
Ooh.

29:58.297 --> 30:00.330
Aw.

30:03.569 --> 30:04.735
Well...

30:06.672 --> 30:08.872
You wouldn't understand.

30:09.308 --> 30:10.874
Huh? Ah.

30:14.013 --> 30:15.746
Ah.

30:15.748 --> 30:18.515
So, Mr. Mayor,
how are the preparations going?

30:18.517 --> 30:21.351
Everything is in order
for tomorrow,

30:21.353 --> 30:25.622
when we celebrate Princess
Isabel's junior coronation.

30:25.624 --> 30:29.326
The coronation of the heir apparent.

30:29.328 --> 30:31.929
Ooh!

30:33.833 --> 30:36.800
Your Monkeyness,
you seem surprised.

30:36.802 --> 30:38.969
But you know
that tomorrow is the day

30:38.971 --> 30:42.606
Princess Isabel becomes an
official member of the Royal Court

30:42.608 --> 30:45.509
and begins
her many royal duties.

30:45.511 --> 30:47.811
Oh, please
don't remind me.

30:47.813 --> 30:50.781
I want to enjoy
my last day of freedom.

30:50.783 --> 30:54.117
Now, Isabel...

30:54.119 --> 30:59.389
There's just
one last piece of business.

30:59.391 --> 31:03.126
I'm afraid the people still
insist on having their

31:03.128 --> 31:05.596
horse race as part
of the big day.

31:11.537 --> 31:14.071
But I've seen to it
that the people's derby

31:14.073 --> 31:17.474
will be over
well before the coronation.

31:17.476 --> 31:20.077
Did you say there's
a horse derby tomorrow?

31:20.079 --> 31:22.980
Why didn't I know about this?
Can we go?

31:24.683 --> 31:27.251
Oh, well, that's not
on our itinerary.

31:28.687 --> 31:31.822
Isabel, these events
are unseemly,

31:31.824 --> 31:33.891
and we will certainly
not attend.

31:35.494 --> 31:36.760
Aw.

31:37.763 --> 31:39.429
The mayor's point

31:39.431 --> 31:42.699
is that it won't interfere
with your coronation.

31:42.701 --> 31:44.768
That's good news, my dear.

31:46.672 --> 31:48.272
Thank you, Mr. Mayor.

32:16.702 --> 32:17.701
What are you doing?

32:33.919 --> 32:37.521
The Royal Monkey
is clearly not himself today.

32:38.724 --> 32:41.325
Allow me, Your Majesty.

32:41.327 --> 32:45.395
Your Monkeyness, I can see you might
enjoy a rest after your long journey.

32:55.607 --> 32:58.875
I trust Your Monkeyness will feel
more like himself after a bath.

32:59.678 --> 33:01.144
Yeah.

33:01.647 --> 33:03.380
Yah!

33:06.919 --> 33:10.153
I see.
Well, I'll leave you to it.

33:11.957 --> 33:13.523
Bye-bye.

33:24.169 --> 33:26.937
How's Philippe?

33:26.939 --> 33:30.440
He's, uh, bathing. So
I think it's best if we just...

33:30.442 --> 33:33.910
Ana, Philippe never behaved
like this before that trip.

33:35.147 --> 33:39.282
I blame that...
that yellow hatted man.

33:39.284 --> 33:42.886
Well, yes, the Royal Monkey will
be back to his well-behaved self

33:42.888 --> 33:44.554
in no time, Your Majesty.

33:44.556 --> 33:47.958
He has such a critical role
in Isabel's coronation.

33:47.960 --> 33:51.862
He's crowning her, for goodness sake.
Nothing can go wrong.

33:53.332 --> 33:54.798
Oh...

33:55.367 --> 33:57.868
Absolutely.

33:57.870 --> 34:01.138
To make sure of it,
I scheduled an extra rehearsal today.

34:01.140 --> 34:04.141
But we've rehearsed
a hundred times.

34:04.143 --> 34:07.277
I know, my dear,
but this is quite important.

34:08.480 --> 34:12.315
Perhaps
we should leave Philippe

34:12.317 --> 34:17.187
so that the bath can have
the full soothing effect.

34:17.188 --> 34:19.755
I'm sure he'll join us
as soon as he's done.

34:19.757 --> 34:22.125
Hmm. No doubt you're right.

34:31.270 --> 34:32.469
Huh?

34:33.605 --> 34:35.237
Your next lesson today:

34:35.239 --> 34:38.574
taking a bath
without making your usual mess.

34:40.212 --> 34:42.846
Now, I know
that's a big step, but...

34:48.887 --> 34:50.487
What? What's the matter?

34:51.790 --> 34:54.190
Oh.
Look at that.

34:56.562 --> 35:00.230
Okay, well, uh, we've got lots
of towels to choose from...

35:00.232 --> 35:02.632
Hmm. Huh? Yeesh.

35:03.435 --> 35:05.368
- Hmm.
- Huh?

35:10.476 --> 35:12.943
Uh... yes, sir.

35:15.114 --> 35:16.546
What just happened?

35:24.423 --> 35:26.857
Okay, young monkey,
that bathroom had better be...

35:31.897 --> 35:33.563
Spotless?

35:37.503 --> 35:38.668
Wow.

35:42.441 --> 35:43.874
Ahem.

35:47.513 --> 35:49.479
Oh. Sorry.

35:58.090 --> 36:03.326
Wow. Perhaps I pushed George
too hard.

36:14.106 --> 36:17.707
Is Your Monkeyness ready
for the coronation rehearsal?

36:17.709 --> 36:19.042
Uh-huh.

36:23.649 --> 36:27.784
Okay, we're picking this up from
the princess already seated.

36:31.723 --> 36:34.958
Excellent.
Now, cue the drummers.

36:34.960 --> 36:37.861
And now, the royal trumpeters.

36:43.135 --> 36:46.903
And now, the Royal Monkey,
bearing his royal scepter.

36:51.410 --> 36:54.444
The Royal Monkey enters!

36:58.217 --> 37:00.684
Oh, come on,
where's the Royal Monkey?

37:05.190 --> 37:06.723
Aha!

37:41.360 --> 37:42.759
Ooh!

37:45.430 --> 37:46.696
Huh?

37:46.698 --> 37:48.865
Did everyone suddenly forget

37:48.867 --> 37:50.467
the king's no-music policy?

37:50.469 --> 37:53.136
Huh?

37:53.138 --> 37:56.606
Your Monkeyness. Please.
We need to continue.

38:04.950 --> 38:06.950
Places, please, places.

38:06.952 --> 38:10.387
And here we go.
Drummers...

38:10.389 --> 38:13.323
Now, carrying the crown,

38:13.325 --> 38:17.160
the Royal Monkey performs
the traditional royal march.

38:19.965 --> 38:23.767
Okay...
The Royal Monkey proceeds...

38:23.769 --> 38:27.504
...with great formality...

38:27.506 --> 38:30.273
and presents the crown
to the princess.

38:50.595 --> 38:52.429
Ooh.

39:17.222 --> 39:18.621
Okay.

39:22.127 --> 39:25.528
I think you have rehearsed
quite enough for one day.

39:27.733 --> 39:31.267
What has gotten into
you two?

39:32.371 --> 39:33.737
Ooh.

39:33.739 --> 39:35.171
Don't worry, Ana.

39:35.173 --> 39:36.639
We're just tired
of rehearsing.

39:36.641 --> 39:38.174
We've done it
perfectly before,

39:38.176 --> 39:39.776
and we'll get it right
tomorrow too.

39:41.646 --> 39:44.547
Well... see that you do.

39:50.989 --> 39:51.821
Oh...

39:52.924 --> 39:54.657
What am I going to do,
Philippe?

39:56.194 --> 39:58.762
Huh?

40:00.198 --> 40:02.465
Oh, this is too awful.

40:15.680 --> 40:17.147
Hmm.

40:19.050 --> 40:21.284
Mm-hmm. Mm-mm-hmm.

40:22.354 --> 40:24.320
Mm-hmm.

40:27.526 --> 40:31.127
This barge should be first
and this one last.

40:33.465 --> 40:37.801
Uh, no, wait...
Uh, this should be first and...

40:37.803 --> 40:40.537
Ugh, this is complicated.

40:43.141 --> 40:45.542
Uh, yes, enter, enter away.

40:47.712 --> 40:49.879
Ah, good. You've brought...

40:49.881 --> 40:52.015
The Royal Monkey,
as you requested.

40:55.086 --> 40:57.187
Thank you, Ana.
That will be all.

41:03.595 --> 41:07.497
Your Monkeyness, I wanted
to speak with you myself.

41:14.339 --> 41:17.574
Ooh.

41:18.777 --> 41:21.478
Oh. You like the boats?

41:23.682 --> 41:29.752
Ah. I made them myself.
See, I added the flags.

41:29.754 --> 41:32.355
And here,
the itty-bitty bunting.

41:32.924 --> 41:34.357
Ooh.

41:35.193 --> 41:36.826
Aah.

41:41.500 --> 41:45.001
Uh-uh, not so fast.
The Royal Barge is on your tail.

41:46.438 --> 41:48.304
And it's a tie!

41:51.710 --> 41:52.876
Ooh.

42:01.319 --> 42:04.621
Yes, uh, well,

42:04.623 --> 42:07.857
I was just finalizing the plans
for Isabel's coronation tomorrow.

42:08.360 --> 42:09.659
Ha-ha.

42:09.661 --> 42:12.562
Uh, which is why
I sent for you.

42:12.564 --> 42:16.733
You see, you were just not
acting like our Royal Monkey.

42:17.536 --> 42:19.936
Oh.

42:21.406 --> 42:24.841
No. You must straighten up.

42:24.843 --> 42:27.176
I'm counting on you
to make sure

42:27.178 --> 42:31.214
absolutely nothing goes wrong
tomorrow that would embarrass Isabel.

42:31.216 --> 42:35.084
Her future, in fact,
the future of the whole kingdom...

42:37.355 --> 42:38.788
depends on it.

42:40.559 --> 42:42.992
Oh.

42:58.243 --> 42:59.576
Hmm.

43:02.714 --> 43:03.813
Hmph.

43:07.852 --> 43:11.120
Hmm?

43:28.273 --> 43:29.872
Hmm.

43:33.278 --> 43:34.377
Hmm.

43:46.257 --> 43:47.523
Hmm.

44:07.312 --> 44:08.411
Huh?

44:36.307 --> 44:38.408
Oh, wow.

44:40.612 --> 44:43.246
Your Monkeyness?
I've never seen you at the stables before.

44:49.120 --> 44:50.620
Huh? Hey!

44:53.124 --> 44:56.192
I'm glad we're done
with those boring rehearsals.

44:56.194 --> 44:59.529
I know my coronation's
important, but after tomorrow,

44:59.531 --> 45:01.431
I'll never be allowed
to have any fun.

45:07.138 --> 45:11.674
Well, you know,
it's not like it is in fairy tales.

45:11.676 --> 45:14.944
Just boring meetings all the
time once I'm a real princess.

45:18.416 --> 45:21.851
Papa says there will be
no time to ride El Fuego.

45:28.059 --> 45:30.827
Your Monkeyness,
you're acting so strange.

45:32.831 --> 45:34.330
Why did you come to see me?

45:35.834 --> 45:36.799
Huh?

45:57.689 --> 45:59.756
I didn't know you and
Fernando were friends.

46:05.096 --> 46:07.029
You seem so different
since our trip.

46:08.366 --> 46:09.766
I like the new Philippe.

46:09.768 --> 46:11.868
Whoa.

46:24.282 --> 46:26.816
Huh?

46:29.254 --> 46:31.320
Oh, dear. Hyah.

46:36.327 --> 46:37.393
Where are you going?

46:44.169 --> 46:46.035
Philippe,
we shouldn't be here.

46:47.639 --> 46:48.738
Ah.

46:53.111 --> 46:54.510
Hmm.

46:56.581 --> 47:00.817
You know, I've never ridden
 El Fuego outside the castle gate.

47:10.962 --> 47:12.929

49:18.389 --> 49:19.722
Ooh.

49:22.260 --> 49:25.094
This is the last
announcement that the people's derby

49:25.096 --> 49:28.464
will start tomorrow
at 11:00 a.m. sharp.

49:28.466 --> 49:32.168
Everyone, young and old,
is welcome to enter.

49:32.170 --> 49:37.940
Just gather your noble steeds at the
starting line after the bugle call.

49:37.942 --> 49:40.609
It's going to be a grand event.

49:40.611 --> 49:44.947
The derby. I'd give anything
to ride in it just once.

49:44.949 --> 49:46.983
And I bet
El Fuego would too.

49:51.089 --> 49:52.421
You think we should?

49:58.796 --> 50:02.565
I... but I...

50:03.134 --> 50:04.767
Huh?

50:07.972 --> 50:10.473
You're right.
This is my last chance.

50:10.475 --> 50:13.309
El Fuego and I
are running in the derby.

50:15.380 --> 50:18.180
But we'd better
get back to the castle.

50:18.182 --> 50:21.317
Papa will be wondering
where we are. Hyah!

50:21.319 --> 50:23.219

50:32.730 --> 50:35.564
Okay, buddy.

50:35.566 --> 50:39.168
After all that hard work,
you deserve a little fun.

50:39.170 --> 50:41.303
So, go ahead, have fun!

50:43.741 --> 50:44.974
Eh.

50:48.312 --> 50:49.278
Huh?

50:51.182 --> 50:55.151
Oh, come on.
This is your favorite park.

51:03.995 --> 51:07.830
Hey, how about climbing?
Oh, you love climbing trees.

51:11.936 --> 51:15.671
Oh, here I go. Look at me.
I am climbing.

51:21.345 --> 51:25.748
Oh, my goodness, this is so much fun!
Hey, come on up!

51:28.286 --> 51:32.288
Hey, so, uh...

51:32.290 --> 51:34.924
how do you get down
from one of these things?

51:36.727 --> 51:38.794
This really isn't necessary.

51:38.796 --> 51:40.863
- Yes, sir.
- You see, it's George,

51:40.865 --> 51:43.933
he's like a different monkey,
and it's all my fault.

51:43.935 --> 51:45.935
Yeah.
Whatever you say, sir.

51:46.804 --> 51:49.038
I just want
my old monkey back.

51:54.145 --> 51:55.311
Argh.

52:06.157 --> 52:07.957
I hope that means
you forgive me.

52:08.626 --> 52:09.959
Mmm?

52:12.130 --> 52:15.364
Hmm. I could use a snack.
How about you?

52:36.120 --> 52:36.986
Hmm.

52:44.629 --> 52:45.995
Mm-hmm.

52:48.466 --> 52:49.732
Mmm.

52:57.842 --> 52:59.842
Is this really necessary?

52:59.844 --> 53:02.778
But, Your Majesty,
studies show

53:02.780 --> 53:04.947
that the more people
watch the coronation,

53:04.949 --> 53:07.383
the better for
the national image.

53:07.385 --> 53:10.219
No, no, I mean makeup.

53:10.221 --> 53:14.290
Oh, it...
brings out your eyes, Your Majesty.

53:15.526 --> 53:17.026
Very well.

53:20.364 --> 53:24.066
In three, two...

53:24.068 --> 53:26.635
Uh, my fellow citizens
of Simiana.

53:30.174 --> 53:32.374
It is my pleasure
to invite you

53:32.376 --> 53:34.643
to my daughter's coronation
tomorrow.

53:41.586 --> 53:43.452
Race you.

53:50.995 --> 53:53.295
Isabel will assume
her official...

53:56.701 --> 53:59.101
Papa?

54:00.571 --> 54:02.338
...with dedication and...

54:02.840 --> 54:05.241
Argh.

54:13.251 --> 54:14.783
Uh-oh.

54:19.457 --> 54:24.126
...to witness our country's
most solemn ceremony.

54:24.128 --> 54:25.594
Ooh-oh!

54:34.105 --> 54:36.238
Aaah!

54:36.240 --> 54:39.174
Well, I think that about
wraps up the interview.

54:45.483 --> 54:48.250
Isabel, what happened?

54:48.252 --> 54:50.452
I'm sorry, Papa.

54:50.454 --> 54:53.722
And, Philippe,
you were supposed to look after her.

54:56.961 --> 54:59.728
Papa, I know I probably
broke every rule...

54:59.730 --> 55:02.898
Riding outside the castle?
And riding a goat?

55:02.900 --> 55:04.133
What if
someone had seen you?

55:04.135 --> 55:07.069
We were just out
trying to have some fun.

55:07.071 --> 55:08.203
Hmm.

55:09.974 --> 55:13.809
Isabel, you don't know how
quickly the people can turn on you

55:13.811 --> 55:16.578
if you go against custom
and look silly.

55:17.782 --> 55:19.615
What do you mean?

55:19.617 --> 55:22.451
Uh, let's not
talk about this anymore.

55:22.453 --> 55:26.088
Ana, see to it that the
princess and Royal Monkey

55:26.090 --> 55:28.324
get to the coronation
on time tomorrow.

55:35.299 --> 55:37.866
- Aah.
- I should have never gone riding with you!

55:39.036 --> 55:40.235
Huh?

55:42.173 --> 55:45.040
Your Monkeyness, I'll see you
at the coronation tomorrow.

55:54.785 --> 55:56.385

Hey, you wanna play
hide-n-seek?

57:31.582 --> 57:32.681
Mmm.

57:34.485 --> 57:36.018
How about checkers?

57:36.787 --> 57:38.020
Uh-uh.

57:38.722 --> 57:40.823
Okay...

57:44.595 --> 57:46.261
How about a movie?

57:46.263 --> 57:49.832
<i>And now for light news
from around the world.</i>

57:49.834 --> 57:53.902
<i>There was a minor mishap in a
little known country, Simiana.</i>

57:53.904 --> 57:55.971
Simiana?

57:55.973 --> 57:59.274
<i>With the upcoming coronation
of their new princess,</i>

57:59.276 --> 58:03.412
<i>they held a press conference and
things did not go quite as planned.</i>

58:03.414 --> 58:05.981
<i>I hope you will
join us tomorrow</i>

58:05.983 --> 58:09.852
<i>to witness our country's
most solemn ceremony.</i>

58:12.423 --> 58:14.523
Oh.

58:14.525 --> 58:16.458
<i>It looks
like that little monkey</i>

58:16.460 --> 58:19.194
<i>caused quite a mess.
In other news...</i>

58:19.196 --> 58:22.598
Hey. That monkey
looks just like you, George.

58:24.668 --> 58:28.237
And he kind of acts like
you used to.

58:31.208 --> 58:32.274
Wait a minute.

58:35.279 --> 58:39.615
Okay, this may sound crazy,
but are you, by any chance,

58:39.617 --> 58:41.783
the Royal Monkey of Simiana?

58:43.454 --> 58:44.786
Uh-huh.

58:46.056 --> 58:48.790
Uh... Wait.

58:48.792 --> 58:51.226
Did you come to the museum
with the king and the princess?

58:51.228 --> 58:53.529
- Uh-huh.
- Oh, boy.

58:53.531 --> 58:55.964
Uh, you... Uh...

59:00.070 --> 59:05.741
So, George is in Simiana
and I didn't break my monkey!

59:07.311 --> 59:11.413
I mean, uh, no offense, Your Magician...
Majestration...

59:11.415 --> 59:13.215
Uh, Mr. Monkey, sir.

59:16.587 --> 59:17.920
We need to get you
back home.

59:19.089 --> 59:20.756
And I've got to get George.

01:00:04.201 --> 01:00:07.269
Huh?

01:00:15.245 --> 01:00:17.980
I'm going to miss you,
El Fuego.

01:00:18.716 --> 01:00:19.881
Huh?

01:00:21.085 --> 01:00:22.951
Your Monkeyness.

01:00:29.093 --> 01:00:30.492
Ah.

01:00:31.962 --> 01:00:34.029
Yeah.

01:00:36.734 --> 01:00:38.133
The derby will start soon.

01:00:45.309 --> 01:00:48.810
You know I can't.
I have to leave all this behind.

01:00:53.651 --> 01:00:56.518
I know,
it would be so much fun.

01:00:59.590 --> 01:01:03.992
But apparently fun is a luxury for
ordinary people, not a princess.

01:01:16.006 --> 01:01:18.840
If fun is for ordinary people...

01:01:23.380 --> 01:01:25.013
then let's be ordinary.

01:01:36.660 --> 01:01:38.627
Hey! Can you give us a hand?

01:02:08.258 --> 01:02:10.258
I can't believe we're doing
this, Your Monkeyness.

01:02:10.260 --> 01:02:11.860
We're really doing this.

01:02:18.869 --> 01:02:24.673
<i>Riders, approach the
starting line. The derby's about to begin!</i>

01:02:35.285 --> 01:02:36.318
Hyah!

01:02:44.128 --> 01:02:47.329
Your Highness?
It's almost time to go.

01:02:49.233 --> 01:02:50.098
Princess?

01:02:53.103 --> 01:02:56.638
Ah, she must be there already.
Probably couldn't wait for her big day.

01:02:56.640 --> 01:02:59.541
That must be it.

01:02:59.543 --> 01:03:02.277
That better be it.
Please let that be it.

01:03:14.992 --> 01:03:17.959
Oh, here you are,
little boy.

01:03:18.428 --> 01:03:20.028
Huh? Ah.

01:03:20.330 --> 01:03:21.830
Huh?

01:03:40.284 --> 01:03:46.121
Riders, on your mark,
get set... go!

01:03:48.425 --> 01:03:51.193
Yeah! Come on! Whoo!

01:03:51.195 --> 01:03:53.228
Go, go, go!

01:04:10.547 --> 01:04:11.847
Ooh.

01:04:18.355 --> 01:04:22.224
Huh?
Uh-oh.

01:04:27.464 --> 01:04:29.965
Oh! It's the Royal Monkey.

01:04:29.967 --> 01:04:31.967
The Royal Monkey.

01:04:31.969 --> 01:04:33.401
The Royal Monkey's
in the race.

01:04:36.740 --> 01:04:38.440
Aah!

01:04:59.029 --> 01:05:02.497
Huh?
The princess is in the race?

01:05:05.369 --> 01:05:09.170
Princess Isabel is in the race!

01:05:09.172 --> 01:05:12.107
- It's the princess!
- Princess Isabel!

01:05:12.843 --> 01:05:13.975
Huh?

01:05:17.414 --> 01:05:20.248
Turn it on, El Fuego.
Hyah!

01:05:24.187 --> 01:05:27.722
Why, it's Princess Isabel
gaining on the lead!

01:05:27.724 --> 01:05:30.625

01:06:12.235 --> 01:06:15.804
Congratulations,
congratulations!

01:06:15.806 --> 01:06:18.373
You won the derby, Princess.

01:06:20.143 --> 01:06:23.611
I can't believe that your
father granted you permission

01:06:23.613 --> 01:06:27.782
to join us, with your
coronation happening so soon.

01:06:27.784 --> 01:06:31.152
My coronation!
I almost forgot!

01:06:31.154 --> 01:06:33.989
I'm so sorry.
We have to go.

01:06:37.928 --> 01:06:40.061
Eh... but your prize,
Princess!

01:06:56.046 --> 01:06:59.014
What a beautiful country
you have.

01:07:03.053 --> 01:07:04.452
Hmm.

01:07:19.036 --> 01:07:20.635
Your Monkeyness.

01:07:27.477 --> 01:07:28.576
Oh.

01:07:32.916 --> 01:07:35.483
Entry
by royal invitation only.

01:07:37.154 --> 01:07:39.621
This is not good.

01:07:46.863 --> 01:07:49.998
Hey, you climbed a tree.

01:07:54.704 --> 01:07:57.806
Oh. And now it's my turn.

01:07:59.376 --> 01:08:02.444
Argh!

01:08:10.754 --> 01:08:12.720
Oh, boy! Ah, an intruder!

01:08:12.722 --> 01:08:15.256
Over there!

01:08:16.893 --> 01:08:19.294
Hey, stop!

01:08:19.296 --> 01:08:22.096
Halt in
the name of the king!

01:08:25.268 --> 01:08:26.334
Come in.

01:08:28.604 --> 01:08:30.371
Ooh.

01:08:32.908 --> 01:08:35.977
I think I'm ready
for my coronation now.

01:08:36.446 --> 01:08:37.812
Uh-huh.

01:08:40.550 --> 01:08:42.884
George? George?

01:08:46.890 --> 01:08:49.357
Over here!

01:08:58.667 --> 01:08:59.868
Eh...

01:09:02.939 --> 01:09:06.241
I think
I've got this backwards.

01:09:14.783 --> 01:09:16.551
Your Highness?
Your Monkeyness?

01:09:48.185 --> 01:09:49.250
George!

01:09:50.353 --> 01:09:52.120
Aw.

01:09:55.025 --> 01:10:00.562
I'm so confused.
Are there two Philippes?

01:10:00.564 --> 01:10:04.232
- Uh-huh.
- George, I am sorry it took me so long to get here.

01:10:04.234 --> 01:10:06.367
I thought you were him
and he was you,

01:10:06.369 --> 01:10:08.803
but I'm so glad
that you're not.

01:10:10.707 --> 01:10:13.007
Er, no offense, Philippe.

01:10:13.009 --> 01:10:17.145
Oh, George,
I missed you so much.

01:10:17.147 --> 01:10:19.380
Don't ever stop being
my fun little monkey.

01:10:19.382 --> 01:10:20.715
Aw.

01:10:30.327 --> 01:10:32.227
- Philippe?
- Uh-huh.

01:10:32.229 --> 01:10:35.163
Yeah, back at the museum,
you left Philippe with me,

01:10:35.165 --> 01:10:36.798
and you took George home
by mistake.

01:10:38.768 --> 01:10:42.370
George, you really spiced
things up around here.

01:10:42.372 --> 01:10:45.406
- Ah.
- He has a way of doing that.

01:10:46.543 --> 01:10:48.910
And I loved it.

01:10:49.512 --> 01:10:51.045
Aw.

01:10:51.047 --> 01:10:54.749
Philippe, I'm glad you're
home safe and sound.

01:10:57.053 --> 01:10:58.019
Mmm.

01:10:59.422 --> 01:11:00.688
Mmm.

01:11:03.760 --> 01:11:04.993
Ah.

01:11:05.895 --> 01:11:07.895
Mmm.

01:11:07.897 --> 01:11:09.731
The intruder's this way!

01:11:09.733 --> 01:11:11.899
Oh, yeah.
I'm the intruder.

01:11:11.901 --> 01:11:13.635
- Over here!
- Come on. We'd better hide you.

01:11:13.637 --> 01:11:14.869
Clear down this hall!

01:11:18.775 --> 01:11:20.541
Check around that corner!

01:11:22.779 --> 01:11:25.980
- What now?
- Shh. Let's just hope they won't come in.

01:11:33.223 --> 01:11:36.291
Uh, George,
best not to touch anything.

01:11:36.293 --> 01:11:37.158
Uh-huh.

01:11:38.795 --> 01:11:39.894
Ooh.

01:11:42.132 --> 01:11:43.831
A secret passage?

01:11:45.735 --> 01:11:47.902
Over here!
Check the king's quarters!

01:11:59.816 --> 01:12:01.616
I got nothing.

01:12:01.618 --> 01:12:02.817
Copy that.

01:12:06.189 --> 01:12:07.422
I think they're gone.

01:12:13.163 --> 01:12:14.062
Oh!

01:12:20.670 --> 01:12:24.739
Uh-huh! Uh-huh!

01:12:29.346 --> 01:12:31.946
- What's going on?
- Intruder in the castle, ma'am.

01:12:31.948 --> 01:12:34.449
If you see a man wearing a yellow
hat, let us know.

01:12:36.353 --> 01:12:37.218
Argh.

01:12:41.124 --> 01:12:45.893
What is this place?
Papa has a secret room?

01:12:46.863 --> 01:12:48.730
Did you know about this?

01:12:48.732 --> 01:12:50.798
Uh-uh.

01:12:55.138 --> 01:12:56.871
All these
old pictures of Papa.

01:12:58.041 --> 01:13:01.275
I never saw any of them.
He was so happy.

01:13:04.047 --> 01:13:06.681
I don't think
I've ever seen him smile.

01:13:06.683 --> 01:13:08.082
Uh-uh.

01:13:09.652 --> 01:13:13.388
Look, Papa played the horn.

01:13:13.390 --> 01:13:15.823
Not for a long time
from the looks of it.

01:13:20.430 --> 01:13:22.063
I wonder why.

01:13:23.700 --> 01:13:25.299
Ooh.

01:13:32.275 --> 01:13:34.842
Hey, look.

01:13:39.883 --> 01:13:42.717
Papa's coronation.

01:13:42.719 --> 01:13:46.020
Look, Philippe,
it's your father.

01:13:46.022 --> 01:13:48.055
Aw.

01:13:48.057 --> 01:13:49.891
<i>And now,
Prince Gustavo</i>

01:13:49.893 --> 01:13:51.759
<i>will perform
his original composition</i>

01:13:51.761 --> 01:13:53.961
<i>for the people of Simiana.</i>

01:13:59.369 --> 01:14:01.269
He's good.

01:14:01.271 --> 01:14:02.837
Uh-huh.

01:14:08.144 --> 01:14:10.311
Huh? Uh. Argh!

01:14:11.781 --> 01:14:13.080
<i>Oh, my goodness.</i>

01:14:13.082 --> 01:14:14.715
<i>What a shocking development.</i>

01:14:14.717 --> 01:14:16.484
<i>The prince has taken a tumble.</i>

01:14:18.288 --> 01:14:20.588
<i>Such an embarrassment.</i>

01:14:20.590 --> 01:14:21.889
Poor Papa.

01:14:24.928 --> 01:14:26.828
Oh.

01:14:26.830 --> 01:14:29.964
That's why he's so scared
of anything ever going wrong.

01:14:29.966 --> 01:14:32.166
He's afraid
people will laugh at us.

01:14:33.570 --> 01:14:35.570
My coronation.

01:14:38.508 --> 01:14:41.676
I can't be late.
I don't want Papa to be embarrassed again.

01:14:41.678 --> 01:14:43.411
How are we going to
get out of here?

01:14:51.621 --> 01:14:53.020
What are you thinking?

01:14:56.626 --> 01:14:58.092
Oh, boy.

01:15:03.266 --> 01:15:04.265
Huh?

01:15:06.636 --> 01:15:07.902
Is that...

01:15:10.006 --> 01:15:12.874
Oh, no, no, no, no, no...
Princess!

01:15:12.876 --> 01:15:14.375
Here we go.

01:15:14.377 --> 01:15:16.444
- Aaah!
- Whoo!

01:15:20.450 --> 01:15:22.450
- Look out!
- Whoo-hoo!

01:15:28.358 --> 01:15:31.492
Oh, oh, my goodness!
Princess, are you okay?

01:15:31.494 --> 01:15:32.860
Never better.

01:15:34.464 --> 01:15:38.332
Philippe? Philippe?

01:15:38.334 --> 01:15:39.800
Hmm.

01:15:42.038 --> 01:15:45.907
Uh, hi, I'm Ted.
From the museum.

01:15:45.909 --> 01:15:49.310
You're hard to forget.

01:15:49.312 --> 01:15:51.979
Ana, I'll explain everything later.

01:15:51.981 --> 01:15:54.982
Right now, we have to
get to the barge. Come on!

01:16:14.504 --> 01:16:15.803
We're too late!

01:16:20.777 --> 01:16:22.777
Ted, grab that rowboat.

01:16:22.779 --> 01:16:26.514
Yes!
Philippe, other monkey, man the oars!

01:16:26.516 --> 01:16:28.115
Better yet, monkey them!

01:16:35.858 --> 01:16:38.993
Uh, anyone have some
horn-removal oil?

01:16:57.547 --> 01:17:00.648
Greetings, citizens of Simiana.

01:17:00.650 --> 01:17:03.417
Let the Royal Coronation begin.

01:17:26.509 --> 01:17:27.708
Huh?

01:17:34.350 --> 01:17:35.516
Where's Isabel?

01:17:41.658 --> 01:17:44.692
A little closer,
a little closer.

01:17:51.434 --> 01:17:52.833
Oh, boy.

01:17:54.771 --> 01:17:56.237
Isabel?

01:17:57.140 --> 01:17:58.439
Philippe?

01:17:59.942 --> 01:18:02.710
This is a disaster.

01:18:24.567 --> 01:18:28.069
This can't be happening.
Not on Isabel's big day!

01:18:29.205 --> 01:18:30.438
Papa?

01:18:31.174 --> 01:18:32.473
Isabel.

01:18:34.377 --> 01:18:36.210
I'm sorry, Papa.

01:18:36.212 --> 01:18:37.878
Oh, there she is!

01:18:37.880 --> 01:18:39.747
Congratulations!

01:18:42.051 --> 01:18:43.751
I don't understand.

01:18:44.420 --> 01:18:45.920
Princess!

01:18:46.923 --> 01:18:49.123
You ran off without this,
Princess.

01:18:50.159 --> 01:18:52.927
Whoa, whoa. Aah!

01:18:54.597 --> 01:18:56.831
Congratulations!

01:18:58.067 --> 01:19:00.901
The derby?
You raced.

01:19:01.404 --> 01:19:03.104
And won!

01:19:16.452 --> 01:19:18.486
Two Philippes?

01:19:20.556 --> 01:19:22.590
And you?

01:19:22.592 --> 01:19:26.127
Hi. Yes, it's me,
Your Majesty.

01:19:26.129 --> 01:19:29.864
And this is Philippe.
But this is George.

01:19:32.468 --> 01:19:34.135
Uncanny.

01:19:36.072 --> 01:19:38.205
Is that my horn?

01:19:38.207 --> 01:19:40.441
Papa, I know
about your coronation.

01:19:41.577 --> 01:19:43.611
You saw?

01:19:43.613 --> 01:19:47.815
You played music so well.
And you loved it.

01:19:48.718 --> 01:19:50.785
- Yeah.
- Uh-huh.

01:19:52.155 --> 01:19:55.990
People laughed at me.
I didn't want that for you.

01:19:57.293 --> 01:19:59.894
You should give the people
another chance.

01:19:59.896 --> 01:20:02.029
Let them get to know you, Papa.

01:20:03.933 --> 01:20:06.901
And you shouldn't let fear stop
you from doing what you love.

01:20:07.937 --> 01:20:09.370
George taught me that.

01:20:15.845 --> 01:20:19.146
Then you are
a very special monkey.

01:20:24.287 --> 01:20:28.088
And you are
a very wise princess.

01:20:34.831 --> 01:20:37.164
- Aw.
- Mmm.

01:21:32.355 --> 01:21:33.888
