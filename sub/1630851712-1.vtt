00:47.630 --> 00:48.631
Hi.

00:48.715 --> 00:51.384
I've been making
something super special for Floyd,

00:51.468 --> 00:52.844
and it's just about ready.

00:52.927 --> 00:53.928
Do you want to see it?

00:54.512 --> 00:55.597
Ta-da!

00:55.680 --> 00:58.475
Welcome to Kitty Cats' Cozy Retreat.

00:59.059 --> 01:02.437
It has a place to sleep, a place to play…

01:02.520 --> 01:04.022
-Boing-boing!

01:04.105 --> 01:07.192
…and, of course, a fancy dining room.

01:07.275 --> 01:08.318
All right.

01:08.860 --> 01:12.447
-Welcome, sir. Your dinner is served.

01:13.073 --> 01:15.909
Very good, sir.
Let me show you to your table.

01:15.992 --> 01:19.329
-Hey! You know what that sound means.

01:19.412 --> 01:21.122
It's time for a Dollhouse Delivery!

01:21.206 --> 01:23.416
Come on,
let's check it out while Floyd's eating.

01:33.760 --> 01:38.306
Hey, Pandy. Are you ready to see
what's in our Meow Meow Mailbox for today?

01:38.890 --> 01:39.724
OK.

01:42.477 --> 01:44.479
Ooh!

01:44.562 --> 01:48.650
Our Kitty Cat Box is covered in stickers

01:48.733 --> 01:51.194
of all different places
you can go and stay.

01:52.153 --> 01:53.905
This one shows a sunny beach.

01:54.614 --> 01:55.448
Oh.

01:55.532 --> 01:59.202
And this one shows a big city
with tall buildings.

01:59.285 --> 02:02.455
Do you think we're gonna go
somewhere special for a vacation?

02:02.997 --> 02:05.416
I don't know. Let's open it and see.

02:09.212 --> 02:11.631
It's a little suitcase!

02:11.714 --> 02:14.217
We are going to stay somewhere!

02:14.300 --> 02:17.095
And look,
it has a cute little cat on it, too.

02:17.637 --> 02:20.890
But where are we going to stay?

02:20.974 --> 02:21.975
Hmm.

02:22.058 --> 02:24.185
Oh!
There's something else in here.

02:25.937 --> 02:29.107
It's a brochure!

02:29.190 --> 02:30.900
We are going to stay

02:30.984 --> 02:33.570
at the Dollhouse Hotel!

02:33.653 --> 02:35.113
They have…

02:35.196 --> 02:37.282
…a pool,

02:37.365 --> 02:38.825
and a spa,

02:38.908 --> 02:41.744
and you can order food from room service.

02:42.453 --> 02:45.331
Do you want to go
to the Dollhouse Hotel with us?

02:45.874 --> 02:47.458
Cat-tastic!

02:47.542 --> 02:48.543
Come on.

02:49.127 --> 02:50.128
Let's go.

02:51.588 --> 02:52.964
Whoa!

02:53.047 --> 02:56.175
Check out the Dollhouse Hotel!

02:56.259 --> 03:00.013
It's got the super-cool entrance
with a pink and white awning,

03:00.096 --> 03:01.431
a circular driveway,

03:01.514 --> 03:03.975
and look at this fancy fountain!

03:04.058 --> 03:05.685
And there's Carlita.

03:06.811 --> 03:08.146
Look at her little hat.

03:08.688 --> 03:10.773
Maybe she works at the hotel!

03:10.857 --> 03:12.650
Let's get in there and find out.

03:13.735 --> 03:15.945
Time to get tiny.

03:26.664 --> 03:29.375
I'm here at the Dollhouse Hotel.
Come on in!

03:30.793 --> 03:33.838
Beep-beep! Welcome to the Dollhouse Hotel.

03:33.922 --> 03:35.381
Ooh!

03:36.466 --> 03:37.926
May I take your bag?

03:38.468 --> 03:40.511
Ooh! Thanks, Carlita.

03:41.804 --> 03:43.097
Wow!

03:43.181 --> 03:45.808
This is pretty cat-tastic, huh?

03:45.892 --> 03:47.435
What do you think, Pandy?

03:48.645 --> 03:49.812
Pandy?

03:51.272 --> 03:53.191
Where is that Pandy hiding?

03:55.151 --> 03:57.528
Hotel hug attack!

03:59.405 --> 04:01.074
-Beep-beep!

04:01.157 --> 04:04.661
Hi, Carlita.
Do you work here at the hotel?

04:04.744 --> 04:05.870
I sure do!

04:05.954 --> 04:09.707
I'm in charge of welcoming all the guests
and helping them with their suitcases.

04:09.791 --> 04:11.876
Come on, let's get you guys checked in.

04:11.960 --> 04:13.836
-Yes!
-Follow me!

04:25.348 --> 04:27.100
Hello, hello, hello!

04:27.183 --> 04:29.686
Welcome to the Dollhouse Hotel.

04:29.769 --> 04:31.646
Now, how can I help you?

04:34.315 --> 04:37.151
Ah, yeah, the Dust Bunny Family.

04:38.236 --> 04:39.988
Here, I have your reservation.

04:40.071 --> 04:42.407
-Hey, you're welcome!

04:42.490 --> 04:45.368
Now, the Box Brothers
will take your bags right up.

04:47.578 --> 04:49.914
Let me take those, Dust Bunny Family.

04:50.498 --> 04:52.041
Boy, this one is heavy!

04:54.669 --> 04:56.337
Hey, enjoy your stay, now!

05:04.262 --> 05:06.931
Gabby and Pandy,
you guys check in at the front desk

05:07.015 --> 05:09.559
and I'll drop your bags off in your room.

05:09.642 --> 05:11.519
-Thanks, Carlita.

05:11.602 --> 05:13.479
-Beep-beep!

05:13.563 --> 05:15.106
This is awesome!

05:22.238 --> 05:25.825
Hey, hey! Welcome to the Dollhouse Hotel.

05:25.908 --> 05:29.287
Hey, DJ Catnip.
You work at the hotel, too?

05:29.370 --> 05:31.956
I sure do. I run the front desk.

05:32.040 --> 05:36.794
I welcome everyone to the hotel
and check them into their rooms.

05:36.878 --> 05:40.381
Let's see. "Gabby and Pandy." Ah, yes.

05:40.465 --> 05:42.383
I have your reservation right here.

05:42.467 --> 05:45.595
Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy! I'm so excited!

05:51.059 --> 05:53.269
Mr. CatRat, how can I help you?

05:53.853 --> 05:56.397
Yeah, did I leave my comic book?

05:56.481 --> 05:58.775
Technically a graphic novel,
but never mind.

05:58.858 --> 06:02.195
Did I leave it down here when
I checked in? I can't find it anywhere.

06:02.278 --> 06:05.239
Hmm.
Let me take a quick look around for you.

06:05.823 --> 06:07.784
Not there. Not there.

06:07.867 --> 06:08.826
Hmm.

06:08.910 --> 06:11.120
-Definitely not here.

06:11.954 --> 06:13.372
No, Mr. CatRat.

06:13.456 --> 06:15.708
All right. I'll keep looking.

06:15.792 --> 06:18.127
Oh, hey, it's Gabby and Pandy.

06:18.211 --> 06:20.755
-You guys staying here, too?
-Yep!

06:20.838 --> 06:24.467
Great! Maybe we can meet up
for a snack later.

06:24.550 --> 06:25.927
Toodley-doo!

06:26.010 --> 06:29.055
OK, OK, here is your key card.

06:29.138 --> 06:30.223
Ooh!

06:30.306 --> 06:33.476
Oh! I love key cards! Can I hold on to it?

06:33.559 --> 06:34.769
Sure, Pandy.

06:34.852 --> 06:35.853
Yes!

06:35.937 --> 06:39.607
I'll keep it right here in my Pandy Pack,
and whenever we need it…

06:40.483 --> 06:43.111
Pacha! I'll have it at the ready.

06:43.194 --> 06:46.239
And don't forget, at the Dollhouse Hotel…

07:20.565 --> 07:23.943
Oh, I see here you're just in time
for your spa treatments.

07:24.610 --> 07:27.196
MerCat is ready for you
up in the hotel spa.

07:27.738 --> 07:30.158
Ooh! Thanks, DJ Catnip.

07:30.241 --> 07:31.951
Enjoy your stay!

07:35.705 --> 07:39.250
All right! We're going to the hotel spa.

07:39.333 --> 07:40.251
Hmm.

07:40.334 --> 07:43.254
Which button should we push
for the hotel spa?

07:46.174 --> 07:47.592
That's the spa button.

07:47.675 --> 07:49.010
I'll push it.

07:51.137 --> 07:52.138
Hmm.

07:55.266 --> 07:56.267
Hey!

07:56.976 --> 07:58.311
Nothing's happening.

07:58.394 --> 08:01.439
I think we have to use our key card
for the elevator.

08:01.522 --> 08:02.982
Oh, yeah!

08:04.317 --> 08:05.985
Pacha!

08:08.821 --> 08:11.616
-It worked!

08:19.081 --> 08:20.249
Ooh!

08:22.126 --> 08:24.170
-Welcome to…

08:24.253 --> 08:26.714
-…the hotel spa!

08:26.797 --> 08:28.549
-Hi, MerCat.

08:28.633 --> 08:31.010
We're super excited for our spa treatment.

08:31.093 --> 08:34.013
It's gonna be spa-tastic!

08:34.096 --> 08:35.598
First things first.

08:35.681 --> 08:38.351
Let's get you some spa robes.

08:38.434 --> 08:39.477
Sounds good to me.

08:42.522 --> 08:43.648
Ooh!

08:44.232 --> 08:46.734
Fluffy and comfy.

08:49.320 --> 08:51.113
-Oh, yeah!

08:51.739 --> 08:56.202
So… what treatment
would you like to do at the spa today?

08:56.285 --> 08:57.286
We have…

08:58.120 --> 09:00.540
face masks, seaweed wraps…

09:01.165 --> 09:03.209
glow-in the-dark manicures.

09:03.292 --> 09:06.295
Ooh! I'd love a glow-in-the-dark manicure.

09:06.379 --> 09:08.923
All right.
Wonderful choice, Gabby.

09:09.006 --> 09:10.967
How about you, Pandy?

09:11.050 --> 09:12.760
We have bubble baths,

09:12.843 --> 09:14.804
super slime soaks.

09:14.887 --> 09:17.223
A super slime soak?

09:17.306 --> 09:18.474
I'm in!

09:18.558 --> 09:21.018
Fantastic! Let's get started.

09:25.231 --> 09:28.276
If you fellas can take Pandy
to the slime soak,

09:28.359 --> 09:31.362
I'm gonna get started
on Gabby's glowing manicure.

09:33.990 --> 09:35.700
Whoa! Full service!

09:36.325 --> 09:37.326
OK, Gabby.

09:39.954 --> 09:41.872
Have a seat. Get comfy.

09:44.041 --> 09:46.460
And… Aha! Here it is!

09:46.544 --> 09:49.338
My glow-in-the-dark nail polish.

09:49.422 --> 09:50.548
Whoa!

09:54.010 --> 09:57.096
I love the green.
How are you doing over there, Pandy?

09:58.014 --> 10:00.141
It's all tutti-frutti.

10:00.224 --> 10:01.225
Yep!

10:24.832 --> 10:26.959
-Excuse me.

10:35.301 --> 10:37.970
I think my nails are all dry.

10:38.596 --> 10:42.683
OK, Gabby. Are you ready to see that glow?

10:43.309 --> 10:45.519
Whoa!

10:45.603 --> 10:46.687
Check it out!

10:47.647 --> 10:49.106
Are all my nails glowing?

10:50.566 --> 10:51.734
No?

10:51.817 --> 10:55.738
Whoa. Look at that.
This little one is missing her glow.

10:57.406 --> 10:58.407
Huh.

10:58.491 --> 11:00.951
Whoops!
I guess I missed that one.

11:02.203 --> 11:03.579
Let me fix that, Gabby.

11:06.040 --> 11:08.000
Oh. Well, that's strange.

11:08.084 --> 11:11.253
I wonder
where my glow-in-the-dark polish went.

11:11.337 --> 11:12.505
It was right here.

11:13.047 --> 11:14.757
It's OK, MerCat.

11:14.840 --> 11:17.551
I'm sure we can come up
with a creative solution.

11:17.635 --> 11:18.886
Ooh! I know.

11:18.969 --> 11:21.389
We can do that one nail
in a different color.

11:22.640 --> 11:24.600
Ooh! Rainbow!

11:25.267 --> 11:27.978
One rainbow nail would look cat-tastic.

11:28.062 --> 11:29.897
Yes! Let's do it.

11:33.609 --> 11:34.527
Whoa!

11:35.111 --> 11:37.238
I love it!

11:37.321 --> 11:39.323
Thank you so much, MerCat!

11:40.908 --> 11:42.368
You're all set, Pandy!

11:43.119 --> 11:45.538
Wow! Thanks, guys.

11:45.621 --> 11:48.958
They really treat you like a king
at the Dollhouse Hotel.

11:49.041 --> 11:50.459
How was your slime soak?

11:50.543 --> 11:51.377
Slippery,

11:51.460 --> 11:53.087
slimy,

11:53.170 --> 11:56.507
and my fur feels so soft.

11:56.590 --> 11:58.801
Attention, hotel guests.

11:58.884 --> 12:02.680
The Dollhouse Hotel's
popping pool party's about to begin.

12:02.763 --> 12:04.557
A popping pool party?

12:05.099 --> 12:06.725
Paw-tastic!

12:06.809 --> 12:07.852
Let's go!

12:07.935 --> 12:09.311
Thanks for the spa time.

12:09.395 --> 12:10.980
Hey, enjoy the hotel.

12:11.063 --> 12:12.148
Thanks, MerCat.

12:12.731 --> 12:15.943
All right, we need to go to the pool.

12:16.026 --> 12:18.737
Which button should we press for the pool?

12:22.616 --> 12:23.701
That one!

12:23.784 --> 12:24.994
Pandy?

12:25.077 --> 12:26.454
Key card ready!

12:27.455 --> 12:28.330
Pacha!

12:41.427 --> 12:44.221
-Thanks, Cat-A-Vator.

12:48.976 --> 12:50.603
Are you kitten me?

12:50.686 --> 12:52.730
Check out this pool scene!

12:52.813 --> 12:55.149
It's pretty cat-tastic.

12:55.232 --> 12:58.027
Welcome to the Dollhouse Hotel pool party.

12:58.110 --> 12:59.153
Hey, Kitty Fairy.

12:59.236 --> 13:02.615
We are so ready
to dive in on this pool party.

13:04.074 --> 13:08.704
Well, let me show you around.
But first, a little pool party magic.

13:09.622 --> 13:10.748
Whoa!

13:11.457 --> 13:12.833
Follow me!

13:21.425 --> 13:22.676
Come on, guys!

13:24.470 --> 13:26.138
Cannonball!

13:26.222 --> 13:27.515
Pandy-ball!

13:27.598 --> 13:28.933
Gabby-ball!

13:49.245 --> 13:51.622
How about a fruity smoothie
while you relax?

13:51.705 --> 13:52.748
Thanks!

13:54.833 --> 13:57.711
Ah… Good to the last slurp.

14:05.344 --> 14:07.805
Is this hotel great, or what?

14:07.888 --> 14:11.350
It's even better
than a jar of fresh pom-poms.

14:11.433 --> 14:14.353
I know what you mean, Baby Box.

14:14.436 --> 14:16.855
Hey, my towel's gone.

14:16.939 --> 14:18.399
Where could it have gone?

14:18.983 --> 14:21.026
That's odd. It was just there.

14:21.110 --> 14:22.361
Hang on, Pandy.

14:22.444 --> 14:25.698
Something strange is going on
at this hotel.

14:25.781 --> 14:29.076
First, CatRat's comic book was missing,

14:29.159 --> 14:32.621
then MerCat's
glow-in-the-dark nail polish,

14:32.705 --> 14:34.832
and now your towel.

14:34.915 --> 14:36.500
Here you go, Pandy.

14:36.584 --> 14:37.585
Thanks.

14:38.961 --> 14:41.005
-Whoa!

14:41.088 --> 14:43.215
Sounds like my tummy needs some yummy.

14:43.299 --> 14:46.427
Why don't we go to our room
and order some room service?

14:46.510 --> 14:48.178
Oh, yeah!

14:48.262 --> 14:49.471
Great idea!

14:49.555 --> 14:51.599
We'll take those towels for you.

14:53.517 --> 14:56.186
Thanks for the cat-tastic pool time,
Kitty Fairy.

14:56.270 --> 14:59.315
It was popping! Bye, Baby Box.

14:59.398 --> 15:00.441
Bye!

15:01.901 --> 15:02.902
Pandy?

15:03.611 --> 15:05.070
All right, let me at it.

15:06.447 --> 15:07.990
Pacha!

15:10.367 --> 15:13.662
-I'm a natural key card ninja.

15:23.255 --> 15:24.924
Hello, hotel guests!

15:25.549 --> 15:27.927
Welcome to your room.

15:28.010 --> 15:30.220
Hey, Pillow Cat. Do you work here, too?

15:30.304 --> 15:32.056
I sure do!

15:32.139 --> 15:37.144
I unpacked your suitcase
and put your PJs in the Dress-Up Closet!

15:38.187 --> 15:41.398
Cozy PJs sound good right now.

15:43.025 --> 15:45.402
Hi, Dress-Up Closet. Can I come in?

15:49.949 --> 15:53.035
Nothing better than nice,
warm PJs after the pool.

15:54.244 --> 15:55.245
My turn!

15:58.958 --> 15:59.959
Ah…

16:02.670 --> 16:04.171
Whoo!

16:04.254 --> 16:05.255
Oh, yeah!

16:05.339 --> 16:06.882
Make room for me!

16:10.886 --> 16:13.222
You need to eat.

16:13.305 --> 16:18.435
Oh! Can I offer you something
from our room service menu?

16:18.519 --> 16:20.771
Thanks, Pillow Cat. What should we get?

16:20.854 --> 16:21.689
Hey!

16:21.772 --> 16:24.441
Has anyone seen my comic book around here?

16:24.525 --> 16:27.361
Hey, CatRat. I haven't seen it anywhere.

16:27.444 --> 16:29.947
Sorry. I haven't, either, CatRat.

16:30.030 --> 16:33.409
We just got into our PJs and we're about
to order some room service.

16:33.492 --> 16:36.078
Room service? Are you kidding me?

16:36.161 --> 16:38.580
I'd love to! Mm!

16:42.960 --> 16:44.336
Coming in! Ha-ha!

16:46.338 --> 16:48.674
Make yourself comfy, CatRat.

16:49.758 --> 16:53.387
OK. What is everyone in the mood for?

16:53.470 --> 16:54.471
CatRat?

16:54.555 --> 16:56.098
Hmm.

16:56.181 --> 16:57.433
Let's see.

16:57.516 --> 17:00.519
I'm in the mood for something sour.

17:01.311 --> 17:03.564
Do you see something sour on the menu?

17:07.276 --> 17:08.777
The pickle? Mm!

17:08.861 --> 17:10.863
Yeah. Ooh! That's a good choice.

17:10.946 --> 17:12.990
I'll get the pickle, please.

17:13.073 --> 17:15.367
Pandy, what are you gonna have?

17:15.451 --> 17:18.746
I'm in the mood
for something salty and crunchy.

17:18.829 --> 17:21.165
What do you see that's salty and crunchy?

17:25.961 --> 17:27.755
Pretzels! Mm!

17:27.838 --> 17:29.339
That's what I'm gonna get.

17:31.008 --> 17:33.552
I'm in the mood for something sweet.

17:34.136 --> 17:36.221
Do you see something sweet on the menu?

17:39.558 --> 17:41.810
Oh! An ice cream sundae!

17:41.894 --> 17:43.228
Yum!

17:43.312 --> 17:44.813
Oh, all right.

17:44.897 --> 17:46.440
One ice cream sundae,

17:46.523 --> 17:48.650
an order of pretzels, and a pickle.

17:48.734 --> 17:50.319
I'll put your order right in.

17:51.945 --> 17:53.739
Ooh! I can't wait!

17:56.200 --> 17:57.242
What was that?

17:59.119 --> 18:02.081
Sounds like it's coming
from under the bed.

18:02.164 --> 18:03.332
Let's check it out.

18:08.754 --> 18:11.423
It's the Dust Bunny Family!

18:13.884 --> 18:14.885
And look!

18:14.968 --> 18:17.346
They've got Pandy's towel for the bed,

18:17.429 --> 18:20.516
they're using MerCat's nail polish
as a night light,

18:20.599 --> 18:24.394
and they're reading CatRat's comic book
as a bedtime story.

18:24.478 --> 18:26.230
Oh!

18:26.313 --> 18:28.732
So that's where my comic book went.

18:28.816 --> 18:31.735
Aww!
That's the cutest thing I've ever seen.

18:31.819 --> 18:34.488
-It is pretty cute.

18:35.489 --> 18:37.991
Your room service is here!

18:38.659 --> 18:40.452
We just ordered room service.

18:40.536 --> 18:42.704
Do you want to come up
and have a snack with us?

18:48.752 --> 18:50.045
Here, have some.

18:51.296 --> 18:53.549
Mm-mm!

18:53.632 --> 18:54.466
Yummy, yummy!

18:55.467 --> 18:57.511
Mm! Mm!

18:57.594 --> 18:59.888
This is the best pickle I've ever had!

18:59.972 --> 19:01.431
Mm!

19:01.515 --> 19:03.183
Crunchy and salty.

19:03.267 --> 19:04.434
You know what?

19:05.018 --> 19:08.230
I think the Dollhouse Hotel is the best!

19:41.930 --> 19:45.142
Thanks for playing
in the Dollhouse Hotel with me.

19:45.225 --> 19:48.312
I'm so glad the Dust Bunnies had fun, too.

19:48.395 --> 19:51.023
Hey, are you ready for another surprise?

20:08.498 --> 20:10.959
It's me, Pillow Cat!

22:23.550 --> 22:24.968
That's how we roll!

22:28.430 --> 22:32.267
I just love Pillow Cat, and she really
does know how to roll with it.

22:33.310 --> 22:36.354
I had a great time
staying at the Dollhouse Hotel with you.

22:36.438 --> 22:40.650
Come back next time and we'll open up
another Dollhouse Surprise.

22:40.734 --> 22:41.735
Bye!
