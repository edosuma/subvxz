(mellow music playing)

01:03.100 --> 01:06.433
-(telephone ringing)
-Hello.

01:06.900 --> 01:09.867
You want to talk to who? Dorothy?

01:10.200 --> 01:12.467
Sorry. You must have dialed
the wrong number.

01:15.033 --> 01:16.934
Blanche, what do you
mean wrong number?

01:17.000 --> 01:19.333
Oh, it was a man,
so I just assumed...

01:19.400 --> 01:21.934
(rings)

01:22.633 --> 01:24.734
-Hello.
-Yes, this is she.

01:26.300 --> 01:29.033
I don't believe it.

01:29.900 --> 01:32.800
Ah, well, oh, that's great.
Why don't you come here?

01:32.867 --> 01:34.100
We'll have lunch.

01:36.133 --> 01:39.667
Oh, fine. Fine.
I'll see you then. Bye-bye.

01:42.367 --> 01:44.166
-Well?
-Well, what?

01:44.233 --> 01:49.133
'Fess up. I know that was a man.
I can always tell when a man calls.

01:49.200 --> 01:51.567
You start sweating
and get the giggles.

01:51.633 --> 01:52.767
I do not.

01:55.700 --> 01:58.533
-All right, talk.
-It's no big deal.

01:58.600 --> 02:02.600
That's my 11th-grade English teacher from
back in Brooklyn, Mr. Gordon.

02:02.667 --> 02:03.867
He's moved to Miami

02:03.934 --> 02:06.233
and wants to get together
tomorrow for lunch.

02:06.300 --> 02:07.500
End of story.

02:10.166 --> 02:12.200
Ah, Mr. Gordon.

02:12.266 --> 02:14.300
Dorothy had a huge,
embarrassing crush on him.

02:14.367 --> 02:17.533
She was his slave,
graded his papers, did his laundry.

02:17.600 --> 02:19.533
Once she even rotated his tires.

02:21.533 --> 02:24.533
That stroke didn't make you
forget a thing, did it?

02:26.600 --> 02:28.900
Crush on the teacher.

02:29.467 --> 02:30.667
I had those.

02:30.734 --> 02:34.033
Course I had to hide them
because they made the principal jealous.

02:36.266 --> 02:40.133
Once I did have a fling
with a calculus teacher.

02:40.200 --> 02:41.533
And did you get an "a"?

02:41.600 --> 02:44.400
More like a full scholarship to MIT.

02:45.934 --> 02:48.433
My Dorothy didn't date
teachers in high school.

02:48.900 --> 02:50.300
She dated losers like Stan

02:50.367 --> 02:52.400
who knocked her up
and ruined her life forever.

02:53.667 --> 02:56.900
It would be like a day without orange
juice, wouldn't it?

02:59.400 --> 03:01.100
Girls, guess what?

03:01.166 --> 03:04.100
They gave me another job
at the television station.

03:04.166 --> 03:06.333
The old associate producer quit...

03:06.800 --> 03:11.100
so now I am the new associate producer
of the <i>Wake-Up! Miami</i> show.

03:11.166 --> 03:13.433
They even game me a nameplate.

03:13.500 --> 03:18.433
-"Harold Goldstein, associate producer."
-Isn't it exciting?

03:18.500 --> 03:21.266
Congratulations, Harold. That's great.

03:21.700 --> 03:23.934
We've already had our first meeting.

03:24.333 --> 03:27.667
I suggested we do a show
about women who live together.

03:27.734 --> 03:31.266
-They jumped on it.
-Rose, that's a great idea.

03:31.333 --> 03:34.867
We have two women lined up.
We need two more.

03:34.934 --> 03:37.600
Rose, open your eyes.

03:38.033 --> 03:40.800
This is exactly the kind of exposure
I've been looking for.

03:40.867 --> 03:44.000
Enough of your exposure.
We're already lost three gardeners.

03:45.934 --> 03:49.266
No, wait. This is a wonderful idea.

03:49.333 --> 03:52.600
You and Blanche live together.
Why don't you do the show?

03:52.667 --> 03:55.433
-I would love to.
-I wouldn't mind it.

03:55.500 --> 03:58.967
There's some very important issues
I'd like to discuss.

03:59.033 --> 04:01.967
-I'll do it, too.
-Sorry, Sophia.

04:02.033 --> 04:04.433
There's only room for two more guests.

04:04.500 --> 04:06.433
Why should I be left out?

04:06.500 --> 04:09.100
If I don't do it, Dorothy won't do it.

04:09.367 --> 04:10.967
When do you want me there?

04:11.633 --> 04:13.300
(calm music playing)

04:13.367 --> 04:14.367
Hi, girls.

04:14.934 --> 04:18.734
-Oh, Dorothy, don't you look nice?
-Why, thank you, Rose.

04:18.800 --> 04:21.200
Mr. Gordon's coming over for lunch today.

04:21.266 --> 04:23.300
We're having it out on the lanai.

04:23.367 --> 04:26.767
So that's why you're acting
like it's the first day of school.

04:28.734 --> 04:30.600
Ma, just stop that.

04:31.133 --> 04:35.600
Mr. Gordon is probably over 70 by now.
He's practically ancient.

04:35.667 --> 04:37.400
70 is ancient?

04:37.734 --> 04:40.133
If I met a man that age
looking halfway decent,

04:40.200 --> 04:41.500
I'd be on my back
before you could say,

04:41.567 --> 04:43.266
"I've fallen, and I can't get up."

04:49.200 --> 04:51.233
That's really beautiful.

04:51.700 --> 04:54.233
There's nothing like that
between me and Mr. Gordon.

04:54.300 --> 04:56.734
If you don't believe me,
join us for lunch.

04:56.800 --> 04:58.000
Join you for lunch?

04:58.266 --> 05:00.233
Let me check my social calendar.

05:00.867 --> 05:03.500
-(doorbell chimes)
-Oh, ok, I'm free.

05:04.333 --> 05:07.433
Ma, that calendar's from 1984.

05:07.500 --> 05:10.834
Oh, yeah. This is the day
I escaped from Shady Pines.

05:10.900 --> 05:14.066
It says right here, "I'm free. I'm free."

05:16.834 --> 05:20.767
-Mr. Gordon.
-Dorothy, you look wonderful.

05:20.834 --> 05:22.700
Oh, well, thank you, Mr. Gordon.

05:23.834 --> 05:26.767
No more of that "Mr. Gordon" stuff.
It's Malcolm.

05:26.834 --> 05:29.066
Absolutely, Mr. Malcolm.

05:30.633 --> 05:32.200
Come meet my roommates.

05:32.633 --> 05:36.400
Uh, Blanche, Rose, my mother Sophia...

05:36.700 --> 05:39.734
-Malcolm Gordon.
-Of course, Mrs. Petrillo.

05:39.800 --> 05:42.667
We met before, you were having
a problem with my son Phil.

05:42.734 --> 05:45.133
Oh, right, the problem with the dress
code.

05:45.200 --> 05:48.233
I still don't understand the problem.
He was wearing a dress.

05:50.266 --> 05:53.133
Oh, my goodness.
You're as cute as Dorothy said you'd be.

05:53.200 --> 05:54.967
That never happens.

05:56.900 --> 06:00.000
Lots of my ex-students
were surprised I wasn't older,

06:00.066 --> 06:03.033
but they failed to realize
I started teaching right out of college.

06:03.100 --> 06:05.100
I really wasn't much older than they were.

06:05.166 --> 06:11.867
I guess when you're 17, 23 can seem rather
dangerous and forbidden.

06:14.367 --> 06:18.033
When you're 17,
a cow can seem dangerous and forbidden.

06:26.633 --> 06:28.200
Am I alone here?

06:29.967 --> 06:33.300
Well, why don't we go out to the lanai?

06:33.367 --> 06:37.367
-Wait. Didn't you forget something?
-Oh, yes, of course. Goodbye, mother.

06:38.433 --> 06:41.433
What? What goodbye?
You invited me to lunch.

06:41.500 --> 06:42.567
Rain check. Rain check.

06:44.333 --> 06:47.667
I think that is a lovely idea,
Mrs. Petrillo.

06:47.734 --> 06:51.767
I'll be on my best behavior.
I won't do anything to embarrass you.

06:52.533 --> 06:53.533
Oh, wait.

06:54.400 --> 06:56.867
Goofy pictures of Dorothy
when she was a kid.

06:57.934 --> 07:00.066
Might as well have
a couple laughs over lunch.

07:00.767 --> 07:04.500
(serene music playing)

07:04.567 --> 07:07.233
Now here's a picture
of Dorothy's ninth birthday party.

07:07.300 --> 07:08.900
Look how scared the clown looks.

07:11.133 --> 07:14.500
I can't believe you actually got a clown
for my birthday.

07:14.567 --> 07:16.567
I can still see his big red nose

07:16.633 --> 07:20.233
and those huge
black circles around his eyes.

07:20.300 --> 07:22.633
He wasn't a real clown.
He was a friend of your father's.

07:22.700 --> 07:24.433
He'd been beaten up the night before.

07:26.000 --> 07:27.767
He got a couple bucks.

07:28.633 --> 07:30.000
That's why he kept saying,

07:30.066 --> 07:32.533
"Now remember, kids,
nobody likes a squealer."

07:34.333 --> 07:38.166
Here are pictures of Dorothy at 11,
a hilariously awkward age for her.

07:39.967 --> 07:42.900
Enough pictures.
Why don't you get coffee?

07:42.967 --> 07:44.433
'Cause it gives me the trots.

07:46.233 --> 07:50.433
Oh, I get it. Company?
Company? Pardon me.

07:52.600 --> 07:55.200
-She's charming.
-Oh, you're very kind.

07:55.266 --> 07:58.000
I'm sorry she bored you
with all these old pictures.

07:58.066 --> 08:01.567
Nonsense. I enjoyed it. Oh...

08:02.600 --> 08:03.633
look.

08:03.700 --> 08:05.967
Look, your graduation picture.

08:06.667 --> 08:11.400
-You were such a lovely girl.
-Oh, I never felt that way.

08:12.100 --> 08:15.433
I always felt awkward and clumsy,
except in your class.

08:15.500 --> 08:20.033
You made me feel intelligent and beautiful
and special.

08:20.367 --> 08:21.600
I never forgot that.

08:22.033 --> 08:24.967
And I have never forgotten you.

08:27.900 --> 08:30.233
So, how do you like being retired?

08:30.300 --> 08:31.834
Actually I intend to work.

08:31.900 --> 08:36.567
I got my first assignment to write an
article for the <i>Book Review</i> section.

08:36.633 --> 08:39.300
I'm a little nervous. It's due next week.

08:39.367 --> 08:45.100
Now you know how we used to feel
when you would assign us a book report.

08:45.166 --> 08:48.633
I remember your crazy excuse
when you didn't have yours...

08:48.700 --> 08:51.300
that you married that kid Stan,
what's-his-name?

08:51.900 --> 08:53.200
Gee, I don't remember.

08:55.000 --> 08:57.400
I'm having a little trouble
getting started.

08:57.467 --> 08:59.667
I can't seem to get my thoughts organized.

08:59.734 --> 09:02.934
Well, maybe you'd like a little help?

09:03.000 --> 09:07.333
-Really? I certainly could use a little.
-Well, I'd be happy to.

09:07.400 --> 09:09.734
That is great. We'll start tomorrow.

09:09.800 --> 09:13.800
No. I'm doing a TV show tomorrow morning.

09:13.867 --> 09:18.934
-TV show, well, I'm impressed.
-It's just a little ol' local show,

09:19.000 --> 09:23.133
but they're anxious to get my views
on women's issues.

09:24.867 --> 09:27.934
Come to the studio.
We'll start right after.

09:28.033 --> 09:29.433
Perfect.

09:29.967 --> 09:31.967
Just perfect.

09:32.500 --> 09:33.500
Dorothy...

09:35.300 --> 09:36.400
to us.

09:38.967 --> 09:42.667
More goofy pictures!

09:44.266 --> 09:47.166
Here's Dorothy in her wedding gown.
Look how scared the groom looks.

09:48.767 --> 09:53.100
(mellow music playing)

09:54.934 --> 09:57.066
Come on, Blanche.
You're on in one minute.

09:57.133 --> 10:00.066
You sit over there.
Dorothy, get touched up.

10:00.133 --> 10:04.200
Sophia, I'll see if I can find you
a seat in the audience.

10:09.166 --> 10:10.233
Dorothy.

10:11.367 --> 10:14.967
Oh, you look lovely.
Oh. For your television debut.

10:15.266 --> 10:18.333
-Oh, they're beautiful.
-Dorothy.

10:21.967 --> 10:23.133
Good luck.

10:29.834 --> 10:31.567
Come on, Dorothy. We're starting.

10:34.900 --> 10:35.967
He kissed me.

10:37.000 --> 10:38.567
He gave me flowers.

10:38.633 --> 10:42.567
Dorothy, come on. It's almost time.
Over here, honey.

10:42.633 --> 10:43.667
Please.

10:46.000 --> 10:47.433
Sit right down there.
That's it.

10:47.500 --> 10:50.100
-What's wrong with her?
-Malcolm kissed her.

10:50.467 --> 10:52.066
My God, she's in shock.

10:54.166 --> 10:57.767
He gave me flowers... from a store.

10:59.367 --> 11:00.834
Ladies, good morning.

11:00.900 --> 11:05.433
We go on in about 10 seconds.
Just relax and have a fun show.

11:09.233 --> 11:11.533
Good morning.
Welcome to <i>Wake-Up! Miami.</i>

11:11.600 --> 11:15.734
Today, women who live together.
Does society make it tougher?

11:16.000 --> 11:19.000
We'll find out
when we talk to four lesbians

11:19.066 --> 11:21.900
today on <i>Wake-Up! Miami.</i>

11:26.800 --> 11:31.667
(calm music playing)

11:33.433 --> 11:35.834
Rose, could I see you for a moment?

11:43.767 --> 11:44.967
You're mad, aren't you?

11:47.700 --> 11:48.700
Rose Nylund...

11:49.100 --> 11:52.500
every man I know is watching the show,
this live show,

11:52.567 --> 11:56.166
this live show about
lesbian lovers of Miami.

11:57.700 --> 12:01.767
Every man you know is watching?
Hey, we could beat <i>The Price Is Right.</i>

12:04.800 --> 12:08.100
Rose, we can't kill you here
because there are cameras.

12:09.233 --> 12:12.200
-Now how did this happen?
-Oh, I don't know.

12:12.667 --> 12:16.467
They just said they wanted two women
who loved each other and slept together.

12:18.233 --> 12:21.734
-We do not sleep together.
-Yes, you did.

12:22.166 --> 12:25.200
Last month when Blanche
had her room repainted

12:25.266 --> 12:28.066
because the plaster behind her headboard
all fell out.

12:32.367 --> 12:34.400
We're back in 30 seconds, ladies.

12:34.467 --> 12:38.633
Listen, I'm not going to do this.
If you leave, they'll fire me.

12:38.700 --> 12:39.700
Good.

12:41.400 --> 12:44.834
My mother is here.
My teacher is here. Good.

12:44.900 --> 12:47.834
If I lose my job,
I won't be able to do anything but...

12:48.333 --> 12:51.066
sit home and tell St. Olaf stories.

12:53.667 --> 12:54.800
Blackmail.

12:55.633 --> 12:57.967
Oh ho, very smart.

12:59.133 --> 13:02.133
Hey, they don't call me
Harold Goldstein for nothing.

13:04.033 --> 13:07.066
Maybe if we don't say anything.
We're not on camera that much.

13:07.133 --> 13:09.633
We can't let Rose lose her job.

13:10.133 --> 13:13.000
(audience applauding)

13:14.967 --> 13:17.734
We're back. Let's meet our panelists.

13:17.800 --> 13:20.367
Dorothy... a lesbian.

13:24.867 --> 13:27.033
Blanche... another lesbian.

13:29.967 --> 13:34.133
And Pat and Kathy, image consultants.

13:37.567 --> 13:42.400
-How come they're not lesbians?
-We don't believe in labels.

13:44.367 --> 13:47.166
Oh, I see we have a question
from the audience.

13:49.166 --> 13:50.166
Yes, sir?

13:50.533 --> 13:53.433
Are there male/female roles
in the relationship?

13:56.967 --> 14:00.433
Well, I am the little homemaker,
if that's what you mean.

14:01.633 --> 14:03.934
Now wait a minute! Just let...

14:09.967 --> 14:11.834
and I take out the garbage.

14:13.800 --> 14:16.834
Fascinating, huh? Any other questions?

14:17.166 --> 14:18.500
Ah, here we go.

14:20.333 --> 14:22.934
This is directed to Dorothy's lover.

14:24.867 --> 14:27.867
Do people treat you differently
because you're a lesbian?

14:28.934 --> 14:30.900
Uh, well, most people don't know.

14:32.500 --> 14:33.500
Really?

14:34.066 --> 14:35.667
I would have guessed right off.

14:41.767 --> 14:43.066
Next question to Dorothy.

14:43.367 --> 14:48.600
What kind of pain and embarrassment
has this lifestyle caused your mother?

14:51.967 --> 14:55.400
I really don't know,
but... I'll ask her tomorrow

14:55.467 --> 14:57.900
when I visit her at the home.

15:05.633 --> 15:06.734
No more questions.

15:09.166 --> 15:14.266
(serene music playing)

15:15.300 --> 15:18.734
(kettle whistles)

15:20.533 --> 15:22.734
Not one phone call all day.

15:22.800 --> 15:26.000
That's not true, Blanche,
the phone's been ringing off the hook.

15:26.066 --> 15:29.400
Not one phone call from a man.

15:30.734 --> 15:32.800
By the way, Dorothy,
if I were a lesbian

15:32.867 --> 15:35.834
I sure would be a popular one.
Look at this.

15:36.233 --> 15:38.066
20 calls.

15:39.233 --> 15:42.867
Mirror, mirror on the wall, who's the--
oh, what am I doing?

15:45.033 --> 15:47.967
Listen to me. Rose,
I could just strangle you.

15:48.033 --> 15:49.633
So you're still miffed?

15:50.166 --> 15:55.100
Well, I don't mind being labeled a lesbian
but since I'm not...

15:55.400 --> 15:57.200
you just ruined my social life.

15:57.767 --> 15:59.100
Oh, go ahead,

15:59.533 --> 16:02.367
Blanche, I'm a bubblehead
and I deserve to die.

16:05.967 --> 16:09.166
I said, I'm a bubblehead
and I deserve to die.

16:10.667 --> 16:12.400
And it was worth repeating.

16:15.433 --> 16:18.133
I just got off the phone
with my girlfriend Gladys.

16:18.200 --> 16:20.200
She thinks you can do better than Blanche.

16:23.066 --> 16:29.300
-I agree, but I have work to do here.
-You're still working on that article?

16:29.367 --> 16:31.433
You were just going to help organize it.

16:31.500 --> 16:35.266
You're letting him take advantage of you
like in high school.

16:35.734 --> 16:40.166
He is under a lot of pressure,
and I don't want him to kiss his deadline.

16:47.266 --> 16:48.533
Miss.

16:49.000 --> 16:50.967
Miss his deadline.

16:51.967 --> 16:53.200
Ooh, Mr. Gordon.

16:56.000 --> 16:57.767
Oh, all right. I admit it.

16:57.834 --> 17:03.667
I do have a little crush...
but his kiss just took me by surprise.

17:03.734 --> 17:05.433
At first, I didn't think
he was going to do it.

17:05.500 --> 17:07.700
He looked like he was going to wink...

17:08.266 --> 17:12.900
then he slanted his head
just slightly to the left.

17:12.967 --> 17:14.600
Oh, I know that slant.

17:16.200 --> 17:17.533
You know every slant.

17:19.734 --> 17:22.667
So let my daughter finish her
one kissing story of the year.

17:23.266 --> 17:24.500
Thank you, Ma.

17:25.467 --> 17:27.200
My pleasure, meal ticket.

17:29.266 --> 17:34.000
It was at that point that I realized
his head was coming toward me.

17:34.066 --> 17:36.367
-Were his eyes open or closed?
-Open.

17:36.433 --> 17:38.033
Ooh!

17:38.734 --> 17:39.934
And then he landed.

17:40.000 --> 17:46.467
I thought, oh, Mr. Gordon, if only Cynthia
Costello was here to see this.

17:46.934 --> 17:48.400
Kinky.

17:52.033 --> 17:57.166
I don't like you being taken advantage
of by some guy from out of town.

17:57.233 --> 18:00.100
At least when Blanche does it,
it's good for tourism.

18:02.500 --> 18:07.000
(mellow music playing)

18:10.433 --> 18:12.633
Then you're really
not mad at me anymore?

18:12.900 --> 18:15.433
I'm a reasonable person. I forgive you.

18:15.500 --> 18:17.467
Does that mean you'll
turn my heat back on?

18:17.533 --> 18:19.700
I was really chilly last night.

18:20.834 --> 18:22.000
Ok, Rose.

18:22.467 --> 18:25.133
What made you decide to forgive Rose?

18:25.200 --> 18:29.166
I'm reasonable, kind, and considerate
and back in the game.

18:29.233 --> 18:30.934
I have a date tonight with a young man

18:31.000 --> 18:33.533
I met in the produce department
at the market.

18:34.066 --> 18:36.000
I showed him how to thump a melon.

18:38.266 --> 18:40.633
There's a euphemism
we haven't heard before.

18:42.600 --> 18:43.800
I realized something.

18:43.867 --> 18:46.934
Just because every man
in my life thinks I'm a lesbian

18:47.000 --> 18:51.333
doesn't mean there aren't millions of men
out there who don't.

18:52.000 --> 18:53.533
(doorbell chimes)

18:53.967 --> 18:55.800
That must be my melon man.

18:56.700 --> 18:58.834
Zorro rides again.

19:00.667 --> 19:02.400
-Chuck.
-Thumper.

19:04.800 --> 19:07.066
Not exactly a Disney movie, is it?

19:08.700 --> 19:10.700
Oh, Chuck, this is my roommate Rose,

19:10.767 --> 19:12.967
and this is my roommate Dorothy
and her mama Sophia.

19:13.033 --> 19:15.633
Oh, yes. I recognize them from TV.

19:16.300 --> 19:18.033
You saw the show?

19:18.100 --> 19:21.700
It was one of the things
that attracted me to you.

19:21.767 --> 19:26.333
-Well, you don't understand.
-Oh, I do understand, Blanche.

19:26.400 --> 19:30.734
You're this way because you've probably
never been with a real man.

19:33.600 --> 19:36.033
Dorothy, do I wet myself or laugh?

19:38.934 --> 19:42.200
You need to be loved
by someone who knows how...

19:42.834 --> 19:44.233
someone who will take his time

19:44.300 --> 19:47.800
and then show you passion beyond
your wildest dreams.

19:52.600 --> 19:54.200
Dorothy, it's over between us.

19:58.467 --> 20:01.600
-Blanche!
-Dorothy, now don't try to stop me.

20:01.667 --> 20:04.700
Don't you see I have to try this?

20:07.033 --> 20:10.166
Oh, all right, Blanche.
I... I understand.

20:10.633 --> 20:11.767
You're a good sport.

20:13.133 --> 20:14.800
You just take care of her.

20:18.767 --> 20:23.734
(calm music playing)

20:25.367 --> 20:27.300
(doorbell chimes)

20:32.633 --> 20:35.367
I hope you don't mind me dropping by,

20:35.433 --> 20:38.100
but I got an advance copy
of the <i>Book Review.</i>

20:38.166 --> 20:40.934
I thought you'd like
to see our article in print.

20:41.000 --> 20:43.467
Are you kidding? Oh, let me read it.

20:43.867 --> 20:49.133
"19th century writers living in the 20th
century by Malcolm Gordon."

20:49.633 --> 20:53.200
-I see you used my title.
-Oh, yes. Read on. Read on.

20:55.133 --> 20:56.867
Dorothy, is something wrong?

20:56.934 --> 21:00.734
This is exactly the same
article that I gave you.

21:00.800 --> 21:04.133
It didn't need much work.
I didn't add much.

21:04.200 --> 21:06.667
You didn't add my name to it.

21:06.734 --> 21:10.100
Well, no, no, not this time,
but next time.

21:10.567 --> 21:15.300
-There'll be a next time?
-I did rewrite your article.

21:15.367 --> 21:18.800
They asked for a lot of changes
in a few, short hours,

21:18.867 --> 21:21.467
so I submitted your pages,

21:21.533 --> 21:26.934
and... well, I was just too embarrassed
to tell them that it was your work,

21:27.000 --> 21:29.166
but it won't happen again. I promise.

21:29.233 --> 21:30.967
No. It won't.

21:32.934 --> 21:36.233
-Goodbye, Mr. Gordon.
-Hey, Malcolm.

21:39.500 --> 21:40.433
I'm sorry.

21:40.900 --> 21:42.200
So am I.

21:52.467 --> 21:53.867
What's wrong, Dorothy?

21:54.333 --> 21:56.000
Ma, you were right again.

21:57.066 --> 21:58.667
He was just using me.

21:58.734 --> 21:59.800
Sit down, pussycat.

22:00.567 --> 22:01.900
I want to tell you something.

22:04.567 --> 22:07.500
You give too much, and when you do that,
you're going to get hurt.

22:07.567 --> 22:11.567
I know. Oh, but I was so disappointed.

22:12.266 --> 22:14.834
For 40 years I've had this fantasy

22:14.900 --> 22:19.500
that Mr. Gordon would come swooping into
my life like sir Lancelot.

22:20.734 --> 22:22.300
Now I don't even have that.

22:22.767 --> 22:24.533
You can keep the fantasy alive.

22:24.600 --> 22:25.867
It's part of life.

22:26.767 --> 22:29.367
You know what I call my pillow? Sal.

22:30.200 --> 22:31.266
Sometimes I hug it.

22:31.333 --> 22:34.066
Sometimes it lays there like a big lump,
just like your father.

22:36.300 --> 22:39.166
-That's how I keep him alive.
-That's lovely, Ma.

22:39.834 --> 22:42.367
You know what I call my other pillow?
Dino.

22:44.567 --> 22:46.000
But that's another story.

22:48.033 --> 22:51.266
I'll tell you about it
when you're, oh, about 70.

22:52.066 --> 22:53.400
I'll be here.

22:54.000 --> 22:56.867
So will I, pussycat. So will I.

22:57.867 --> 23:02.700
(mellow music playing)

23:03.600 --> 23:05.600
(doorbell chimes)

23:09.433 --> 23:10.433
Yes?

23:10.500 --> 23:12.433
Hi, I don't know if you remember me.

23:12.500 --> 23:13.567
My name is Pat.

23:13.834 --> 23:16.033
I was on <i>Wake-Up! Miami</i>
with you last week.

23:16.100 --> 23:19.100
Oh, yes, what can I do for you?

23:20.233 --> 23:22.100
I heard about you and Blanche.

23:28.400 --> 23:30.367
I'm sorry. It's too soon.

23:32.600 --> 23:33.767
Too soon.
