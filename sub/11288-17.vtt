SOME LUNATIC MISTOOK ME
FOR DIANA ROSS

02:35.301 --> 02:37.103

02:37.170 --> 02:39.506
SO, WHAT WAS YOUR COVER STORY?

02:39.573 --> 02:43.176
I TOLD THE GIRLS I WAS IN PHILLY

YOU KNOW...

03:37.203 --> 03:39.005
I WAS REALLY SURPRISED

03:39.072 --> 03:42.543
WHEN YOU SUGGESTED
THIS DANGEROUS LIAISON.

03:42.609 --> 03:44.878
JUST REMEMBER, THIS IS
NOT ABOUT ROMANCE.

03:44.945 --> 03:45.946
THIS IS ABOUT SEX.

03:46.012 --> 03:47.447
MM‐HMM.
THE WHOLE SEX

03:47.514 --> 03:49.182

THEIR MAGIC

04:37.470 --> 04:38.672
LET'S GO. HERE WE GO.

04:38.738 --> 04:39.773

OVERTON SPENDS MORE TIME

04:41.174 --> 04:43.009

THAN THE CARPET.

04:44.210 --> 04:47.914
IT IS FINALLY OUR TURN
TO PLAY UNWANTED HOUSE GUEST

04:47.981 --> 04:51.618
AND WE ARE GOING TO ENJOY
EVERY HOUR OF IT.

04:51.685 --> 04:53.887
AIN'T THAT RIGHT,
MY PAYBACK PARTNER?

04:53.954 --> 04:55.021
THAT'S RIGHT.

04:55.088 --> 04:56.923
MATTER OF FACT

04:56.990 --> 04:59.425
I THINK IT'S TIME
WE RAID THE FREEZER

04:59.492 --> 05:02.703
AND THEN SETTLE IN
FOR A MARATHON GAME OF JEOPARDY.

05:02.769 --> 05:04.771
OH‐OH‐OH!

05:04.838 --> 05:06.439
( both chortling )

05:06.507 --> 05:09.976
I TAKE "PAINS IN THE ASS"
FOR 500.

05:10.043 --> 05:11.244
OH, BE PATIENT, BABY.

05:11.311 --> 05:13.914
I MEAN, THIS IS THE PERFECT TEST
OF OUR ABILITY

05:13.980 --> 05:15.481
TO HANDLE UNWELCOME GUESTS.

05:15.549 --> 05:19.285
THE WAY TO HANDLE THEM
IS TO SHOW THEM THE DOOR.

05:19.352 --> 05:20.521
I SAY LET THEM STAY A WHILE.

05:20.587 --> 05:21.988
I MEAN,
IT WOULD BE GOOD TRAINING.

05:22.055 --> 05:23.423
TRAINING?

05:23.489 --> 05:27.360
IS THAT THE TYPE OF TRAINING
WHERE I DO WHATEVER YOU SAY?

05:27.427 --> 05:29.495
"OH, YES, <i>OBIE.</i>

05:29.563 --> 05:32.699
WHATEVER YOU SAY, <i>OBIE."</i>

05:36.670 --> 05:38.572
DON'T TAUNT ME, WOMAN.

05:38.639 --> 05:40.040
YOU KEEP GOING
LIKE THIS

05:40.106 --> 05:42.108
TAUNTING IS ALL
YOU GOING TO GET.

05:44.745 --> 05:46.513
OH, LOOKY HERE.

05:46.580 --> 05:49.816

MYSELF, NOW

MRS. I‐CLIP‐MY‐
TOENAILS‐IN‐BED.

05:54.154 --> 05:56.590
DON'T GO THERE,
MR. STINKING BOOTS.

05:59.693 --> 06:01.868
AH, HOLD UP.

06:01.935 --> 06:05.138
NOW, THIS A REAL ARGUMENT
OR AN EXPERIMENTAL ONE?

06:05.205 --> 06:06.707
LET'S CALL IT EXPERIMENTAL

06:06.773 --> 06:08.575
BUT WE SHOULD MAKE UP
TO BE SURE.

06:08.642 --> 06:09.876
TALK TO ME.

06:11.845 --> 06:14.480
MMM‐WOW!

06:14.548 --> 06:15.616
YOU KNOW WHAT?

06:15.682 --> 06:16.750
FORGET JEOPARDY.

06:16.817 --> 06:18.484
WE GOING TO WATCH
ROOTS UNCUT

06:18.552 --> 06:20.353
ON THE HISTORY CHANNEL.

06:20.420 --> 06:21.387
LADIES, IT'S 10;00.

06:21.454 --> 06:23.123
YOU KNOW WHERE
YOUR APARTMENT IS?

06:23.189 --> 06:24.124
HEY!

06:24.190 --> 06:25.258
( chuckles )

06:25.325 --> 06:27.093
THAT'S TEN
MINUTES LONGER

06:27.160 --> 06:29.863
THAN I THOUGHT
WE COULD HAVE
STAYED UP THERE.

06:29.930 --> 06:31.297
HEY, LOU.
HELLO, LADIES.

06:31.364 --> 06:33.499
WOULD YOU ACCEPT
THIS FOR MAX?

06:33.567 --> 06:35.602
I'D LEAVE IT
BY HER DOOR

06:35.669 --> 06:36.637
BUT IT'S MARKED
"PERISHABLE."

06:40.907 --> 06:41.975
THANK YOU.

06:42.042 --> 06:44.911
HUH. CHECK THIS OUT.

06:44.978 --> 06:46.079
IT'S FROM HER MOM

06:46.146 --> 06:48.148
BUT, I MEAN,
IF THEY'RE TOGETHER

06:48.214 --> 06:51.051
WHY DIDN'T SHE JUST GIVE IT
TO MAX?

06:55.421 --> 07:00.160
UNLESS MAX ISN'T IN PHILLY
AT ALL.

07:00.226 --> 07:02.335
WHAT'S THIS I SMELL?

07:02.402 --> 07:03.537
COULD IT BE...

07:03.604 --> 07:06.640
DIRT?

07:06.707 --> 07:10.744
WELL, IF IT ISN'T THE NANCY DREW
OF THE PROJECTS.

07:10.811 --> 07:14.380
I'M TELLING YOU,
MAXINE IS UP TO SOMETHING.

07:14.447 --> 07:16.116
MY MISSION...

07:16.182 --> 07:19.686
AND I CHOOSE TO ACCEPT IT...

07:19.753 --> 07:23.990
IS TO FIND OUT WHAT SHE'S DOING.

07:24.057 --> 07:27.127
OR WHO.

07:31.698 --> 07:32.633
MAXINE!

07:39.472 --> 07:40.907
WHAT IF SOMEBODY SEES YOU?

07:40.974 --> 07:41.942
GET IN HERE.

07:42.008 --> 07:43.877
KYLE, WE ARE ON
THE 11th FLOOR.

07:43.944 --> 07:45.478
WE DON'T KNOW ANY PIGEONS.

07:45.546 --> 07:47.280
ALL RIGHT,
ALL RIGHT, OLD MAN.

07:47.347 --> 07:48.615
I'M COMING.

07:48.682 --> 07:51.652

WHO IS PARANOID ABOUT PEOPLE

07:51.718 --> 07:53.253
FINDING OUT ABOUT US.

07:53.319 --> 07:55.656
I'M JUST TRYING
TO GO WITH THE FLOW.

07:55.722 --> 07:59.092
WHEN HAS MR. IRON‐HIS‐DRAWERS
EVER GONE WITH THE FLOW?

07:59.159 --> 08:01.034
UH, YOU KNOW,
I DON'T KNOW WHY

08:01.101 --> 08:02.736
I LET YOU TALK ME
INTO THIS.

08:02.803 --> 08:05.205
WELL, IT SURE DIDN'T
TAKE MUCH CONVINCING.

08:05.271 --> 08:07.340
I SAID "KYLE, YOU WANT
TO MEET ME

08:07.407 --> 08:09.676
AT THE ALEXANDER HOTEL
THIS WEEKEND?"

08:09.743 --> 08:11.377
YOU SAID, "WHAT THE HELL."

08:11.444 --> 08:14.347
YOU KNOW, AND HELL
IS EXACTLY WHAT I AM GETTING.

08:14.414 --> 08:15.782
YOU HAVEN'T
CHANGED A BIT.

08:15.849 --> 08:17.884
YOU ARE STILL
THE SAME TORTURED SOUL.

08:17.951 --> 08:19.085
YOU KNOW, IT'S FUNNY

08:19.152 --> 08:21.555
HOW I ONLY FEEL TORTURED
IN YOUR PRESENCE.

08:23.056 --> 08:24.390
THAT'S IT.

08:24.457 --> 08:25.826
I DON'T NEED THIS.

08:25.892 --> 08:27.127
I'M OUT OF HERE.

08:27.193 --> 08:28.762
PRESS.

08:33.700 --> 08:35.101
ARE YOU AS HOT AS I AM?

08:35.168 --> 08:37.070
HOTTER, BABY, HOTTER.

08:45.812 --> 08:49.850
O‐B‐I‐E...

08:49.916 --> 08:52.185
EXCLAMATION POINT.

08:53.186 --> 08:55.989
BREAKFAST IS SERVED,
MY HEAVENLY BODY.

08:56.056 --> 09:00.066
BREAKFAST‐IN‐COUCH‐‐
HOW SPECIAL.

09:01.668 --> 09:03.537
CLOSE YOUR EYES, OBIE.

09:03.604 --> 09:05.906

UPSCALE APARTMENT

09:10.844 --> 09:13.146
UH, DEAR HEART

09:13.213 --> 09:17.383
UH, DON'T YOU MEAN OUR
RUSTIC CATSKILLS COTTAGE?

09:17.450 --> 09:19.485
WE'LL HAVE
TO LIVE IN MANHATTAN

09:19.553 --> 09:21.221
IF I'M TO CONQUER BROADWAY

09:21.287 --> 09:24.090

I HAD MY HEART SET

ON BUILDING US A LOG LOVE
BUNKER AMONGST THE BRAMBLES.

OH, HOLD UP.

OKAY, TELL YOU WHAT.

09:43.409 --> 09:45.712
IF YOU BECOME
THE BELLE OF BROADWAY

09:45.779 --> 09:48.081
WE'LL BE ABLE TO AFFORD
A HELICOPTER

09:48.148 --> 09:50.851
THAT CAN FLY BETWEEN
OUR SWANKY APARTMENT

09:50.917 --> 09:52.686
AND OUR RUSTIC RETREAT.

09:52.753 --> 09:55.822
SO, WE CAN ENJOY THE PENTHOUSE
DURING THE WEEK

09:55.889 --> 09:58.224
AND THE OUTHOUSE ON THE WEEKEND.

09:58.291 --> 09:59.325
THERE YOU GO.

09:59.392 --> 10:00.567
CRISIS SOLVED.

10:00.634 --> 10:01.802

10:01.868 --> 10:05.572
I'LL START LOOKING
FOR HELICOPTERS POSTHASTE.

10:20.987 --> 10:24.124
DEVIL DOG FROM <i>THE OMEN?</i>

10:24.190 --> 10:29.129
WELL, CUJO WAS A SAINT BERNARD
LAST I CHECKED.

10:29.195 --> 10:30.430
OH, COME ON, MAN.

10:30.496 --> 10:32.498
ALL HE NEEDED WAS A RABIES SHOT.

10:32.566 --> 10:35.368
YOU CAN'T GET A SHOT
FOR THE DEVIL.

10:35.435 --> 10:36.703
HE COULDN'T HELP IT

10:36.770 --> 10:38.539
IF HIS MASTER
WAS THE PRINCE OF DARKNESS.

10:38.605 --> 10:40.440
I DON'T WANT NO
UGLY DOG...( blubbering ).
IT'S SCARY!

10:42.509 --> 10:44.945

10:50.817 --> 10:53.520
YEAH, I DIDN'T EVEN NEED THIS.

10:53.587 --> 10:55.956
HEY, YOU WANT TO ORDER
SOME MORE ROOM SERVICE?

10:56.022 --> 10:57.257

WHAT'D YOU SAY?

11:04.137 --> 11:06.172
I'M ACTUALLY
QUITE SATISFIED.

11:17.483 --> 11:19.119
MAYBE THE WEDDING

11:19.185 --> 11:20.453
THE FOOD'S LOUSY.

11:20.521 --> 11:22.589
AND YOU KNOW THIS HOW?

11:22.656 --> 11:23.724
WELL

11:23.790 --> 11:25.191
WHILE YOU WERE NAPPING

11:25.258 --> 11:27.894
I WENT DOWNSTAIRS
TO GET SOME ICE.

11:27.961 --> 11:30.664
AND WANDERED INTO THE BALLROOM.

11:30.731 --> 11:33.466
THEY HAD A GOOD D. J.

11:35.435 --> 11:36.937
YEAH, IF YOU LIKE

11:37.003 --> 11:41.341
THAT SMOOTH, SENSUAL
EROTIC KIND OF GROOVE.

11:50.183 --> 11:51.518

11:51.585 --> 11:54.621
DID SOMEBODY
TURN ON A HEATER?

11:54.688 --> 11:56.356
SOMETHING'S ON.

12:03.236 --> 12:04.237
WELL...

12:04.304 --> 12:07.273
IF IT ISN'T THE UNWELCOME WAGON.

12:07.340 --> 12:09.009
WHAT YOU PACKIN'?

12:09.075 --> 12:10.577
A LITTLE PEACE OFFERING‐‐

12:10.644 --> 12:14.347
WHITE CHOCOLATE
MACADAMIA NUT CHEESECAKE

12:14.414 --> 12:17.851
WITH A PRETENTIOUS
RASPBERRY SWIRL.

12:17.918 --> 12:20.554
WE ARE CERTAIN KYLE WOULD
WANT YOU TO HAVE IT.

12:20.621 --> 12:22.889
( laughing )

12:22.956 --> 12:24.157
THANK YOU.

12:24.224 --> 12:26.693
KYLE.

12:26.760 --> 12:31.698
THE CURIOUSLY OUT‐OF‐TOWN‐
THIS‐WEEKEND KYLE.

12:31.765 --> 12:34.067
TOKYO, IS IT?

12:34.134 --> 12:37.103
YES, AND HE'S GOING
TO BE REALLY SURPRISED

12:37.170 --> 12:38.705
WHEN REALIZES HE FORGOT

12:38.772 --> 12:41.908
HIS COMBINATION VOLTAGE
CONVERTER‐SOCKET ADAPTER.

12:41.975 --> 12:45.411
I SAW IT ON HIS DRESSER
IN HIS BEDROOM WHEN WE WERE...

12:45.478 --> 12:48.381
<i>DUSTING.</i>

12:48.448 --> 12:51.818
LEFT AN ESSENTIAL ITEM
AT HOME, DID HE?

12:51.885 --> 12:53.587
WAS THERE
ANYTHING ELSE UNUSUAL

12:53.654 --> 12:56.489
ABOUT BARKER'S BEHAVIOR
ON THE DAY OF HIS DEPARTURE?

12:56.557 --> 12:59.560
NO. NO, HE WAS REALLY
EXCITED ABOUT GOING.

12:59.626 --> 13:01.868
WHICH IS STRANGE

13:01.935 --> 13:03.203
BECAUSE HE HATES
THAT LONG FLIGHT TO TOKYO.

13:03.269 --> 13:07.273
AND YOU JUST CONVENIENTLY
FORGOT THIS UNTIL NOW?

13:07.340 --> 13:08.675
LOOK HERE

13:08.742 --> 13:12.245
EITHER BOOK ME
OR LET ME GO!

13:12.312 --> 13:14.715
YOU'RE FREE TO GO

13:14.781 --> 13:17.984
BUT DON'T YOU THINK
ABOUT LEAVING THIS BUILDING

13:18.051 --> 13:20.286
IN CASE I HAVE OTHER QUESTIONS.

13:20.353 --> 13:23.590
FINE. NOW, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE US,
WE'LL BE UPSTAIRS...

13:23.657 --> 13:25.458
<i>MOPPING.</i>

13:32.733 --> 13:34.601

13:34.668 --> 13:35.736

13:35.802 --> 13:37.470
GET THE HELL OFF OF ME.

13:37.538 --> 13:38.739
SECOND OF ALL

13:38.805 --> 13:40.306

13:40.373 --> 13:42.976
OH, YOU CARE,

THEY ARE SWEATING UP
SOME HOTEL ROOM...

13:51.184 --> 13:54.788
RIGHT HERE IN NEW YORK CITY.

13:54.855 --> 13:56.222
EVEN IF YOU WERE RIGHT

13:56.289 --> 13:58.224
IT'S A THOUSAND HOTELS
IN NEW YORK.

13:58.291 --> 14:00.460
WHAT, YOU GONNA GO
KNOCK ON EVERY DOOR

14:00.527 --> 14:03.570
AND SAY, "KYLE, COME OUT
WITH YOUR PANTS UP."

14:03.637 --> 14:05.906
THERE ARE ONLY EIGHT HOTELS
IN THE CITY

14:05.972 --> 14:08.208
THAT MEETS KYLE'S STANDARDS.

14:08.274 --> 14:11.477
I WILL CALL EACH ONE,
FLIRT WITH THE CONCIERGE

14:11.545 --> 14:15.148
REGARDLESS OF GENDER...

14:15.215 --> 14:18.785
AND THEN I'LL BUST IN
ON THEIR LITTLE SEX PARTY

14:18.852 --> 14:23.189
AND I'LL SAY... "YOU'VE GOT
THE RIGHT TO REMAIN NEKKID."

14:24.490 --> 14:27.360
OH, I GOT TO GET ME
A OUTFIT FOR THIS ONE.

14:36.069 --> 14:37.470

15:48.281 --> 15:49.883

I REALLY DO LIKE YOUR TOUCH

15:51.952 --> 15:55.822
BUT YOUR VISE GRIP IS
CUTTING OFF MY CIRCULATION.

15:55.889 --> 15:59.425
EXCUSE ME
FOR TRYING TO CUDDLE.

16:00.567 --> 16:02.769
TURN OFF THAT DAMNED TV.

16:02.836 --> 16:04.938
OH, I GOT
A SUGGESTION FOR YOU:

16:05.005 --> 16:06.773
WHY DON'T YOU
PUT SOME SOCKS

16:06.840 --> 16:09.042
ON THOSE COLD CLAWS
YOU CALL FEET?

16:09.109 --> 16:10.176
OW!

16:10.243 --> 16:11.177
AW, LOOK AT THAT.

16:11.244 --> 16:12.679
YOU DONE DRAWN BLOOD.

16:12.746 --> 16:14.347
OH, QUIT WHINING,
YOU BIG BABY.

16:14.414 --> 16:16.583
IS THIS GOING TO BE
ONE OF THOSE ARGUMENTS

16:16.650 --> 16:18.418
THAT LEADS TO SEX,
'CAUSE IF IT IS

16:18.484 --> 16:20.053
LET'S JUST SKIP
THE ARGUING.

16:20.120 --> 16:21.922
NO! THIS IS ONE
OF THOSE ARGUMENTS

16:21.988 --> 16:24.991
THAT LEADS ME TO TELLING YOU
WHAT A POMPOUS BORE YOU ARE.

16:25.058 --> 16:26.459
OH, THAT'S IT.

16:26.527 --> 16:28.428
YOU HAVE WORKED MY LAST NERVE.

16:28.494 --> 16:30.063
( muttering ):
NO, I HAVEN'T.

16:31.097 --> 16:34.167
( yelling ):
KYLE BARKER IS NOT IN TOKYO!

16:34.234 --> 16:35.569
SARANARA.

16:37.871 --> 16:39.773
IT HAS BECOME
PAINFULLY CLEAR TO ME

16:39.840 --> 16:42.275
THAT A HUMAN BEING
CAN ONLY SPEND EXACTLY...

16:42.342 --> 16:45.411
36 HOURS, 27 MINUTES
AND 17 SECONDS WITH YOU

16:45.478 --> 16:49.082
WITHOUT ENTERTAINING THOUGHTS
OF VARIOUS FELONIES.

16:49.149 --> 16:51.918
WELL, THE WAY YOU MAKE LOVE
IS HARDLY A MISDEMEANOR.

16:52.953 --> 16:54.788
OH, NOW, SEE,
THAT WOULD HAVE STUNG

16:54.855 --> 16:57.658
IF NOT A HALF AN HOUR AGO,
YOU WASN'T IN THAT BED

16:57.724 --> 17:00.160
HOLLERING, "BREAK IT DOWN,
MR. STOCKBROKER.

17:00.226 --> 17:01.502
B‐B‐BREAK IT DOWN."

17:01.568 --> 17:05.371
BUT I PAID THE PENALTY
FOR EARLY WITHDRAWAL.

17:08.407 --> 17:11.144
WHATEVER.

17:11.211 --> 17:13.113
I'LL SEND THE BELLMAN
FOR MY THINGS.

17:13.179 --> 17:15.315
I'M LEAVING TEN DOLLARS

17:15.381 --> 17:16.583
FOR THE HOUSEKEEPER.

17:16.650 --> 17:19.653
DO NOT‐‐ I REPEAT‐‐
DO NOT BUY CANDY.

17:19.720 --> 17:23.089
A GIRL HAS TO HAVE SOMETHING
SWEET AFTER TWO DAYS WITH YOU.

17:25.959 --> 17:27.594
NEXT TIME

17:27.661 --> 17:29.630
WE GET A ROOM
WITH A FIREPLACE.

17:29.696 --> 17:30.731
AND A SOFTER BED.

17:30.797 --> 17:31.965
YOU BOOK THE ROOM.

17:37.571 --> 17:40.006
( knocking )

17:40.073 --> 17:41.575
WHAT'S THE MATTER, KYLE?

17:41.642 --> 17:43.510
YOU JUST REALIZE
THAT YOUR PAJAMAS

17:43.577 --> 17:45.211
DO NOT MATCH YOUR OVERCOAT?

17:45.278 --> 17:48.882
( English accent ):
HELLO! COULD I BORROW
A CUP OF SUGAR?

17:49.916 --> 17:52.285
WHAT ARE YOU DOING? DAMN!

17:52.352 --> 17:53.920
DAMN! DAMN! DAMN! DANG!

WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

17:55.388 --> 17:56.657

17:56.723 --> 17:59.392
I JUST PASSED YOUR PARTNER
IN CRIME IN THE HALLWAY

17:59.459 --> 18:02.168
BUT I DIPPED INTO THE STAIRWELL
BEFORE HE SAW ME.

18:02.235 --> 18:04.104
<i>SO...</i>

18:04.170 --> 18:06.907
WHEN DID YOU AND KYLE
GET BACK TOGETHER?

18:06.973 --> 18:08.975
WE ARE NOT TOGETHER.

18:09.042 --> 18:10.644
REALLY?

18:10.711 --> 18:12.212
FANCY ROOM...

18:12.278 --> 18:14.414
HUH.

18:14.480 --> 18:18.652
EMPTY CHAMPAGNE BOTTLE...

18:18.719 --> 18:20.386

COME ON. WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

18:23.590 --> 18:24.925
WHAT DO YOU WANT HERE?

18:24.991 --> 18:26.593
WELL, LOOK,
I'M NOT TRYING TO BE

18:26.660 --> 18:28.629
ALL UP IN YOUR
BUSINESS, BUT, UH...

18:28.695 --> 18:30.531
REGINE IS HOT ON YOUR TRAIL

18:30.597 --> 18:33.033

18:42.108 --> 18:45.979
SO, UH, WHY DID YOU AND..?

18:53.687 --> 18:55.922
SO... WHY DID YOU AND KYLE
HOOK UP AGAIN?

18:55.989 --> 18:57.457
YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW.

18:57.524 --> 19:00.934
I MEAN, I THINK IT'S
A REINCARNATION THING, YOU KNOW?

19:01.001 --> 19:03.737
I THINK MAYBE I KILLED HIM
IN ANOTHER LIFE.

19:03.804 --> 19:05.906
OR MAYBE HE REALLY MEANS
SOMETHING TO YOU.

19:05.972 --> 19:07.040
PLEASE GET OFF IT.

19:07.107 --> 19:08.809
THAT MAN IS LIKE
AN ANGRY RASH

19:08.875 --> 19:11.778
THAT JUST KEEPS COMING BACK
NO MATTER HOW HARD YOU TRY

19:11.845 --> 19:13.113
TO GET RID OF IT.

19:13.179 --> 19:17.017
DAMN IF IT DON'T FEEL GOOD
TO SCRATCH IT SOMETIMES.

19:17.083 --> 19:18.952
HA! TOO GOOD, TOO GOOD.

19:19.019 --> 19:21.354
WELL, LOOK, WE BETTER
GET UP OUT OF HERE

19:21.421 --> 19:24.424
BEFORE THAT BLOODHOUND
IN THE WIG SNIFFS YOU OUT.

19:31.865 --> 19:33.800
TELL ME THAT'S NOT
MY EGGBEATER.

19:33.867 --> 19:36.002
YOU DON'T WANT IT BACK.

19:36.069 --> 19:37.571
UGH!

19:41.742 --> 19:44.110
OH, LOOK, DEAR‐‐ COMPANY.

19:44.177 --> 19:47.548
HEY, KYLE, WHAT YOU DOING HOME
FROM TOKYO SO EARLY

19:47.614 --> 19:49.516
AND WHY YOU WEARING PAJAMAS?

19:49.583 --> 19:50.717
I GOT A QUESTION:

19:50.784 --> 19:53.019
WHAT IS YOUR BED DOING
IN THE LIVING ROOM?

19:53.086 --> 19:56.489
IT'S ALL PART OF OUR
COHABITATION EXPERIMENT.

19:56.557 --> 19:57.991
SEE, BABY GIRL HERE

19:58.058 --> 20:00.761
WANTED TO LAY IN BED
AND CUDDLE ALL DAY.

20:00.827 --> 20:03.537
I FELT A BIT CRAMPED
IN MY SMALL QUARTERS

20:03.604 --> 20:06.272
SO WE BROUGHT THE MOUNTAIN
TO MOHAMMED.

20:06.339 --> 20:10.010
AND DOESN'T THE PROPHET
LOOK GOOD IN YOUR ROBE?

20:10.076 --> 20:11.645
DRY CLEAN IT, RETURN IT

20:11.712 --> 20:13.714
AND DISMANTLE
THIS SHANTY TOWN

20:13.780 --> 20:15.348
AT ONCE.

20:15.415 --> 20:17.250
HEY, KYLE,
WHY DON'T YOU BRING ME

20:17.317 --> 20:19.219
A HUNK OF THAT
COBBLER BACK, BABE?

20:19.285 --> 20:22.523
OBIE... YOU PROMISED
NO MORE SWEETS BEFORE BED.

20:22.589 --> 20:25.726
I'M SICK OF YOU
WAKING UP IN TEARS.

20:25.792 --> 20:27.493
WELL, IT'S MY BED

20:27.561 --> 20:30.363
AND I'LL CRY IF I WANT TO.

20:30.430 --> 20:33.399
THAT'S A FINE ATTITUDE
FOR A HUSBAND.

20:34.400 --> 20:35.401
YOU KNOW, GIRL

20:35.468 --> 20:37.571
WE'VE BEEN TOGETHER
FOR TWO DAYS

20:37.638 --> 20:39.940
AND ARGUED NO LESS
THAN SIX TIMES.

20:40.006 --> 20:42.676
MAYBE IT'S TIME FOR US
TO TAKE A LITTLE STEP BACK

20:42.743 --> 20:44.077
AND REALLY FIGURE OUT

20:44.144 --> 20:46.412
IF WE READY
FOR THIS MARRIAGE THING.

20:50.684 --> 20:53.419
MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT.

20:53.486 --> 20:55.055
ON THE OTHER HAND

20:55.121 --> 20:57.658
WE COULD AGREE
THAT MOST COUPLES ARGUE

20:57.724 --> 21:01.134
AND IT DOESN'T MEAN
THEY LOVE EACH OTHER ANY LESS.

21:01.201 --> 21:02.803
WHOO! THAT WAS CLOSE.

21:02.869 --> 21:04.971
HOLD ME.

21:09.876 --> 21:12.445
MADAM, THIS IS THE LAST
ROOM ON THIS FLOOR.

21:12.513 --> 21:15.215
I MEAN, EXACTLY WHO IS IT
YOU'RE LOOKING FOR?

21:15.281 --> 21:17.317
OH, MY GOODNESS.

21:17.383 --> 21:20.320
I'VE NEVER SEEN AN HONOR BAR
PICKED SO CLEAN.

21:20.386 --> 21:23.356
IT'S AS IF IT'S BEEN HOSED DOWN.

21:27.127 --> 21:29.930
DAMN YOU, MAXINE SHAW.

21:29.996 --> 21:32.533
I WILL FIND YOU

21:32.599 --> 21:37.571
EVEN IF I HAVE TO WALK
THE FOUR CORNERS OF THE EARTH.
