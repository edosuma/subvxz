00:02.339 --> 00:04.375
Turk, I totally ruined Izzy's life.

00:04.513 --> 00:05.944
Already? It's only 8:30.

00:06.191 --> 00:09.244
I totally forgot there was a parent's
meeting for her play group this morning.

00:09.384 --> 00:11.818
Now she's gonna get kicked out.
She won't have any friends.

00:11.902 --> 00:15.121
She's gonna drop out of high school.
She's gonna start dating some gangbanger,

00:15.328 --> 00:18.575
who you're gonna harass over and over and
over again, to get his life together,

00:18.685 --> 00:21.670
until he snaps and shoots you in
the face... Oh my God!

00:21.725 --> 00:25.481
Whoa! You're bringin' the crazy
extra hard today, huh?

00:25.729 --> 00:26.951
Take a deep breath.

00:29.994 --> 00:32.552
You're the most amazing mom
I've ever seen.

00:32.613 --> 00:34.813
One tiny mistake can't ruin
something that good.

00:35.912 --> 00:37.927
That's the sweetest thing
you've ever said to me.

00:38.497 --> 00:39.371
It is?

00:39.666 --> 00:41.638
This is gonna come back
to you in a good way.

00:42.392 --> 00:45.210
What kind of a good way?
In the boudoir, right?

00:45.563 --> 00:46.466
Up high!

00:46.634 --> 00:49.470
We're getting a little old to be making
such a big deal out of having sex.

00:50.241 --> 00:51.256
Yeah, you're right.

00:52.474 --> 00:55.222
- I'm just playin', man!
- Thank goodness.

00:55.299 --> 00:57.342
When you said that,
I died a little inside.

00:57.624 --> 00:59.117
Give it up for me gettin' some!

01:00.062 --> 01:00.696
Upstairs!

01:01.329 --> 01:02.287
Downstairs!

01:04.027 --> 01:07.176
- I don't really like... downstairs.
- Really? Well, I wanted to try it.

01:08.345 --> 01:09.621
You're ready to do this?

01:10.615 --> 01:12.415
<i>As attending physicians, it was important</i>

01:12.425 --> 01:14.285
<i>that Turk and I took an interest
in the interns.</i>

01:15.123 --> 01:19.766
All right! You're space invaders!
Try and stay together, for goodness sake.

01:20.040 --> 01:21.442
Game on!

01:28.577 --> 01:29.411
Eat it!

01:33.751 --> 01:35.819
All right, Boon!
You're the mother ship.

01:36.174 --> 01:39.978
Josephine, use your annoying voice
to make the mother ship sound.

01:40.310 --> 01:40.936
Go!

01:48.680 --> 01:50.055
Somebody get him some ice!

01:52.722 --> 01:54.345
Does anyone know why we did that?

01:54.859 --> 01:56.504
Because you're so mean and stupid?

01:57.051 --> 01:59.976
No, we did it to teach you an
important lesson about medicine,

02:00.240 --> 02:03.182
which we'll reveal to you once
you've changed into dry scrubs.

02:05.385 --> 02:06.863
- What's the lesson?
- I don't know. We need to come up

02:06.873 --> 02:10.125
with something quick, though, because Boon
has a concussion and his father's a lawyer.

02:10.164 --> 02:11.554
What could we have been teaching them?

02:11.578 --> 02:14.249
All right, listen up.
I'll tell you one thing, people.

02:14.311 --> 02:17.265
You've got to be ready for anything
this hospital trows at you.

02:18.009 --> 02:19.920
- That's perfect.
- I'll go tell the interns.

02:19.966 --> 02:21.772
Wait, wait! Let me write it down
so you don't forget it.

02:21.813 --> 02:22.850
That's a good idea.

02:27.146 --> 02:27.794
Continue.

02:28.456 --> 02:32.903
I've got an overweight patient back there,
who has already had his stomach stapled,

02:32.920 --> 02:37.032
And is now taking diet medication
that gives you painful diarrhea,

02:37.079 --> 02:39.590
whenever you eat more than 15
grams of fat at one sitting.

02:39.658 --> 02:42.929
Anyone want to guess what he's in the
hospital for? I'll give you a hint.

02:43.565 --> 02:46.873
It is very painful, and it rhymes
with schmiorrhea.

02:46.912 --> 02:49.273
You know what, here's an idea.
Patient should just...

02:49.347 --> 02:51.348
pay me to take food right
out of their hands,

02:51.421 --> 02:53.357
before they even have a chance
to cram it down those

02:53.367 --> 02:55.603
disgusting donut mashers they call mouths.

02:55.693 --> 02:57.449
- I mean, honestly...
- God,

02:57.459 --> 02:59.396
Perry, how many times do I have to say it?

02:59.858 --> 03:01.837
We're tired of your speeches.

03:02.586 --> 03:06.531
If you can't stop, I'll have to hire an
orchestra to play that awards show music,

03:06.607 --> 03:09.979
they use to hustle long-winded
hollywood fruitcakes off the stage.

03:10.174 --> 03:12.608
I'm just sick and tired of...

03:17.781 --> 03:19.409
Do you think I should try my new

03:19.419 --> 03:21.934
"I'll take that food right out
of your hands" diet on him?

03:22.405 --> 03:24.826
- Does it matter what I say?
- Does it ever?

03:25.577 --> 03:26.472
No!

03:27.266 --> 03:29.867
<i>Some burns are so bad,
they still get our attention...</i>

03:31.111 --> 03:33.135
Emery, my name is Dr. Dorian.

03:33.508 --> 03:35.503
We're gonna take good care of you, ok?
I promise.

03:37.070 --> 03:38.620
<i>Speaking of getting badly burned...</i>

03:38.860 --> 03:41.479
I'll tell you why I threw water
balloons at you all. All right?

03:42.009 --> 03:44.508
I threw water balloons at
you guys because...

03:45.871 --> 03:48.437
<i>Suck it, bitch!</i>

03:49.801 --> 03:53.922
- I'm so calling my dad.
- You're in trouble now, Mr. Man.

03:55.527 --> 03:57.065
I'm gonna kill J.D.!

So, Emery, your skin graft
is looking great.

04:15.775 --> 04:18.488
It should only be a few more weeks,
and we'll have you in physical therapy.

04:18.519 --> 04:20.442
No. I have to be out of here
by this Saturday.

04:20.797 --> 04:21.771
Why, you got a ho...

04:21.873 --> 04:24.306
<i>Careful. He's a burn victim.
Don't say "Hot date".</i>

04:24.390 --> 04:25.495
Hot rendezvous?

04:25.777 --> 04:26.617
<i>Damn it!</i>

04:26.745 --> 04:28.523
No. It's my high school graduation.

04:29.040 --> 04:31.401
Look, all my friends are going
off to different colleges.

04:31.484 --> 04:33.399
This is the last time
that we'll be together.

04:33.822 --> 04:35.516
Please, just don't make me miss this.

04:35.816 --> 04:37.168
I'll see what I can do.

04:40.281 --> 04:42.172
Turk, don't forget to get your
shift covered tonight.

04:42.209 --> 04:44.125
It's the 6th year anniversary
of our first date.

04:44.912 --> 04:49.496
I hope the present you got me is a good one,
because the one I got you is slammin'!

04:49.556 --> 04:51.635
- I can't wait.
- Ok.

04:52.476 --> 04:54.795
So what's the big gift there, Gordon?

04:55.209 --> 04:57.306
- Who?
- Black guy from "Sesame Street".

04:57.678 --> 05:01.920
Oh, well. The past couple of months
I've secretly been taking classes,

05:01.949 --> 05:05.464
and listening to tapes, and I have
learned Spanish for my baby.

05:05.902 --> 05:07.324
That's fantastic.

05:07.325 --> 05:10.510
It only took you 6 years to learn
the language that your wife speaks.

05:10.677 --> 05:13.068
Hey!
I've been eavesdropping.

05:13.531 --> 05:16.294
I got Lady a real gift
for our 1-month anniversary.

05:16.679 --> 05:18.841
I cured her fear of the unknown.

05:19.509 --> 05:22.383
Women are like crows.
They like shiny things.

05:22.705 --> 05:26.562
Classy stuff they can wear in their ears,
around their necks, through their nipples.

05:26.929 --> 05:28.070
Crows have nipples?

05:28.792 --> 05:31.188
Don't listen to them C-bear,
it's an amazing gift.

05:31.590 --> 05:34.516
Plus, you know how everyone's rude
to those day laborers across the street?

05:34.636 --> 05:36.654
Now we can finally talk to them.

05:42.145 --> 05:45.703
- Do you have work?
- No we just wanted to say "hi".

05:46.015 --> 05:47.499
How are you guys doing?

05:50.112 --> 05:52.275
Congratulations, my brothers.

05:52.417 --> 05:58.768
You have treated us with basic human
compassion and will now be rewarded...

05:58.803 --> 06:05.730
with a trip to the magical paradise
known has Amigoville.

06:08.309 --> 06:10.809
Your magical paradise is a park?

06:10.829 --> 06:14.380
Our people loves the picnics.

06:14.847 --> 06:17.486
Turk, look at the size of this churro!

06:17.814 --> 06:21.461
And over there, there's
a lake filled entirely with guacamole.

06:22.180 --> 06:24.795
Would you like a massage
from one of those beautiful ladies?

06:26.161 --> 06:28.088
No I can't. I'm married.

06:28.252 --> 06:29.489
Not a problem.

06:30.973 --> 06:32.822
I'll take the front.

06:33.228 --> 06:34.930
I'll massage your back.

06:35.264 --> 06:37.236
What a beautiful babes!

06:38.080 --> 06:40.347
What do you think of this place?

06:40.643 --> 06:43.088
I'm sorry. I don't
speak the spanishita.

06:43.371 --> 06:44.946
Is that gonna be a problem?

06:50.513 --> 06:52.639
Do you guys have an idea when
the black guy is coming down,

06:52.645 --> 06:53.960
because he has the car keys.

06:56.119 --> 06:56.868
Idiot!

06:57.717 --> 06:59.121

07:13.732 --> 07:15.985
That's right, bro. Drivin' an amby.

07:16.616 --> 07:18.923
EMT: Emergency...

07:19.121 --> 07:20.861
- something, something.
- Cool!

07:21.127 --> 07:23.476
So how does it compare
to delivering packages?

07:25.725 --> 07:26.932
Excuse me!

07:28.841 --> 07:32.154
- What is it, bro?
- Shouldn't I ride in back with my fingers?

07:41.880 --> 07:43.195
Pretty much the same.

07:43.550 --> 07:44.763
- Late.
- Late.

07:44.883 --> 07:46.283
- Lloyd.
- Dude!

07:47.359 --> 07:49.558
Elliot, can I get your
advice on something...

07:49.678 --> 07:53.008
My burn patient really wants to go to his
high school graduation this weekend.

07:53.336 --> 07:55.493
Why? Mine was awful.

07:55.613 --> 07:58.084
I was the valedictorian, but instead of
bringing my speech,

07:58.204 --> 08:00.226
I grabbed my mom's
love letter to her pool boy.

08:00.346 --> 08:02.912
Well, I was so nervous,
I ended up reading that one anyways.

08:03.032 --> 08:04.564
Apparently, I spoke a lot about

08:05.086 --> 08:07.237
"my fondness for throbbing members".

08:07.682 --> 08:10.843
Still, my closing words to my graduating
class were actually kind of appropriate.

08:10.963 --> 08:13.841
Something about wanting to make sure
I chased all of my dreams,

08:13.961 --> 08:16.531
before I was all old
and dried up down there.

08:17.403 --> 08:21.745
Ok, but do you think that I should
tell Emery that he'll be able to go?

08:22.035 --> 08:24.744
That's a tough call. I mean,
the skin grafts are improving, but

08:25.135 --> 08:26.883
- he could take a bad turn.
- Dr. Reid,

08:27.514 --> 08:29.713
could you sign off on these test results?

08:29.869 --> 08:30.578
<i>To hell with it.</i>

08:30.698 --> 08:32.014
Not at all, Boon.

08:32.284 --> 08:34.424
Emery, I'm gonna get you
to that graduation.

08:34.890 --> 08:35.953
Awesome!

08:37.169 --> 08:39.096
You know what,
I wouldn't get his hopes up.

08:40.274 --> 08:42.532
Oh, thank you for your advice on that.

08:42.690 --> 08:44.017
Yeah, it's tough.

08:45.700 --> 08:47.991
So you guys doing something special
for your anniversary night?

08:48.031 --> 08:49.947
- You know what would be great?
- Here we go.

08:50.632 --> 08:52.359
- Brinner.
- What-er?

08:52.710 --> 08:54.603
Breakfast for dinner.
He's obsessed with it.

08:54.723 --> 08:58.215
I just don't see what's wrong with having
a nice glass of wine with a pancake.

08:59.589 --> 09:01.740
- Bye, baby.
- Bye, mommy.

09:03.145 --> 09:06.191
Hey, thanks for watching Izzy
for us tonight.

09:07.591 --> 09:11.285
Here's a list of things that I like to do
for her that Carla doesn't know about.

09:12.618 --> 09:15.093
For example, I'm not allowed to bother
Izzy at night.

09:15.424 --> 09:18.903
But if she starts to cry, you crawl
in her crib and sleep next to her.

09:19.365 --> 09:21.410
Yeah, I'm gonna be doing that even
if she's not crying.

09:21.444 --> 09:22.737
Ok, here's the other thing.

09:23.841 --> 09:25.480
Carla doesn't want her to have any juice.

09:25.505 --> 09:27.097
But if you let her sip from a juice box,

09:27.283 --> 09:30.184
she gets really, really happy
and start squeaking like R2D2.

09:30.406 --> 09:32.418
Sugar juice equals happy squeaking.
Got it.

09:32.826 --> 09:35.192
I love how Carla's rigid parenting rules
don't apply to us.

09:35.372 --> 09:37.338
- I know!
- Great!

09:37.620 --> 09:38.352
Bye, baby.

09:38.472 --> 09:39.927
- Bye, daddy.
- Bye, baby!

09:41.447 --> 09:44.331
Come on, baby. I got the fever for
some french toasty toast!

09:44.451 --> 09:46.950
- Turk, please! I'm on the phone.
- French toast!

09:47.806 --> 09:50.467
Oh my God, he's obsessed with
this brinner idea.

09:51.345 --> 09:56.163
The truth is, I'd cook breakfast for dinner
if he'd clean up the apartment for once.

09:58.157 --> 09:59.082
Si...

10:09.733 --> 10:12.550
Whatever you're making for dinner
tonight, honey, is fine with me.

10:22.534 --> 10:24.934
Hey, what do you say there, Barbie?
What are you doing here?

10:25.238 --> 10:27.454
I just came to borrow the stroller,
to take Izzy to the mall.

10:27.821 --> 10:29.912
I see. You think Izzy might...

10:30.302 --> 10:32.876
- like a muffin?
- She can't have processed food.

10:33.150 --> 10:34.838
- Carla's not around.
- Give me that.

10:37.074 --> 10:40.444
Emery's grafts are looking great.
Let's get that man a cap and gown.

10:41.231 --> 10:44.169
Why would you bother asking my
advice, if you're just gonna ignore it?

10:44.344 --> 10:45.998
Come on, Elliot.
You know when people ask for advice

10:46.008 --> 10:48.932
they're really just looking for someone to
backup the decision they already made.

10:48.962 --> 10:51.335
It's like when I asked you if
I should buy those white cords.

10:51.365 --> 10:52.837
You said no, but it didn't matter.

10:52.975 --> 10:55.991
I was gonna buy them anyway,
because they match my whit cord jacket.

10:57.379 --> 11:01.716
- Yeah, and that outfit's hideous...
- Now you're just embarassing yourself.

11:02.112 --> 11:04.792
All right, who ever stole my muffin

11:04.864 --> 11:08.288
is going to have to get this green fuzz
out of my teeth.

11:13.232 --> 11:15.052
Baby, I know you'll never believe me

11:15.412 --> 11:18.680
but bacon icecream is the
perfect after-brinner treat.

11:18.843 --> 11:21.960
So, are you ready for presents?

11:22.555 --> 11:24.129
baby, you already made me brinner.

11:24.610 --> 11:26.334
Well, this is for you, too.

11:32.870 --> 11:34.852
You look absolutely amazing.

11:35.921 --> 11:37.573
But it's kinda hard to beat brinner.

11:38.961 --> 11:40.025
Perfect.

11:41.142 --> 11:42.590
Anything for me?

11:43.113 --> 11:44.122
Yeah...

11:46.153 --> 11:48.442
<i>They say it's better to give
than to receive,</i>

11:48.838 --> 11:51.133
<i>but sometimes holding on
to the perfect gift</i>

11:51.235 --> 11:53.439
<i>gets you more than you ever
thought possible.</i>

11:54.990 --> 11:56.293
Tomorrow

11:56.991 --> 12:00.950
I'm taking you to the jewelry store, where
you can purchase anything you want.

12:02.992 --> 12:04.440
Yeah! Right?

12:04.518 --> 12:07.053
You can have anything you want.

12:08.976 --> 12:09.685
Right there.

12:10.502 --> 12:13.764
<i>Of course, sometimes the gift you give
isn't as perfect as you thought.</i>

12:13.981 --> 12:15.206
Tough news there, noobie.

12:15.788 --> 12:18.870
Patient's leg is infected.
There's no way he's going to graduation.

12:18.967 --> 12:19.982
What?!

12:21.231 --> 12:22.301
All the best.

12:34.868 --> 12:36.094
<i>Today was gonna suck.</i>

12:36.256 --> 12:38.557
<i>I hadn't told Emery he couldn't
go to his graduation,</i>

12:38.941 --> 12:40.960
<i>plus I had forgotten that
Turk still owed me one,</i>

12:41.116 --> 12:44.630
<i>and that yesterday we made a water baloon
so big that we acually named it.</i>

12:44.949 --> 12:46.126
Fat Daddy.

12:48.487 --> 12:49.574
Yeah!

12:58.464 --> 13:01.817
So Gandhi, how does your wife
like her terrible present?

13:02.069 --> 13:04.920
I haven't told her yet.
I was going to,

13:05.530 --> 13:08.888
but her not knowing I understand spanish
is like having a secret power.

13:09.465 --> 13:11.514
It got me flapjacks for dinner.

13:11.712 --> 13:13.214
You got brinner?

13:13.743 --> 13:16.398
Daaaamn Turkeldog!

13:16.927 --> 13:18.237
Still, I gotta tell her,

13:18.644 --> 13:19.847
I feel like I'm spying on her.

13:20.262 --> 13:22.479
Marriage is a lifelong battle,

13:22.635 --> 13:24.713
except we men have been given no weapons.

13:25.014 --> 13:27.669
That's why I break into Enid's
email account.

13:28.071 --> 13:30.466
Not telling Jordan that I've
been reading her journal

13:30.476 --> 13:32.751
is one of the best decisions
I've ever made.

13:32.979 --> 13:36.740
Now I know of all her hopes and dreams,
which, of course, make them easier to crush.

13:37.245 --> 13:40.278
You know,
this morning I heard her tell her friend:

13:40.279 --> 13:45.517
"Quisiera que el no oliera como
los huevos despues de hacer ejercicios".

13:46.202 --> 13:47.284
Which meant:

13:47.788 --> 13:51.327
I wish he didn't smell like eggs every
time he works out. So I put on deodorant.

13:51.771 --> 13:54.078
You know, when you think about it,

13:54.432 --> 13:58.493
Carla not knowing I understand her
really is the best thing for her.

13:59.317 --> 14:03.805
Welcome to the club! Have some pizza!

14:04.561 --> 14:05.376
Crap.

14:08.315 --> 14:11.475
- Fat Daddy?
- It was beautiful.

14:12.760 --> 14:15.253
What am I gonna tell to Emery?
Did you hear the song we wrote?

14:15.770 --> 14:16.901
Nurse, do you mind?

14:17.007 --> 14:19.428
<i>Going to graduation.</i>

14:19.549 --> 14:22.516
<i>I'm going to graduation.</i>

14:22.757 --> 14:26.529
It's called "I'm going to graduation
(The graduation song)".

14:26.794 --> 14:29.233
Look, you already put yourself out there,
let's just follow through.

14:29.263 --> 14:31.222
I checked his infection,
it's not that bad.

14:31.432 --> 14:34.832
We just need an ambulance and some other
volunteers, we can still pull this off.

14:35.011 --> 14:36.219
Janitor, will you help?

14:36.783 --> 14:37.859
Uh, no, I can't.

14:37.919 --> 14:39.890
Now that I've cured Lady
of her fear of the unknown,

14:39.900 --> 14:42.575
I'm working on her irrational
fear of losing loved ones.

14:43.319 --> 14:45.969
I arranged for a couple of friends
of mine to kidnap her parents.

14:51.087 --> 14:55.112
Triple chocolate hazelnut fudge with
a filling made out of tiny brownies.

14:55.370 --> 14:57.040
The baker said it would feed 16,

14:57.208 --> 15:01.101
but I am going to take this
Mama Jama down in one sitting!

15:05.763 --> 15:07.603
- Well?
- Well, what?

15:07.867 --> 15:08.461
Perry...

15:08.715 --> 15:11.445
Since I won free muffins
for life, I know I have

15:11.455 --> 15:13.929
packed on a few,
but this system is working.

15:14.308 --> 15:17.240
I am even using the real holes in my belt

15:17.250 --> 15:20.001
and not the ones I stabbed with
the screwdriver. So, come on!

15:20.201 --> 15:22.856
I'll pretend to talk to
this guy. You ditch the cake.

15:23.271 --> 15:26.996
Hey, random employee! Blah, blah, blah.

15:28.449 --> 15:30.672
Bob, I'm very busy.

15:31.427 --> 15:32.540
Fine.

15:35.515 --> 15:38.891
Can't you people see I'm trying
to get some work done here? Leave!

15:39.210 --> 15:41.480
For funzies, I'm gonna say
two words I've always

15:41.490 --> 15:43.715
wanted to say ever since
I started working here.

15:44.040 --> 15:44.936
You ready?

15:46.035 --> 15:47.357
Make me.

15:47.555 --> 15:48.750
- No, you didn't.
- Oh, yes, I did.

15:48.766 --> 15:50.481
- You did? I like it.
- I did.

15:50.605 --> 15:52.938
I'm gonna go ahead and play
it that way. Say, Carla...

15:53.139 --> 15:58.508
Your husband thinks you're
an overbearing control freak with Izzy.

15:58.524 --> 16:00.248
That's not even true!

16:00.849 --> 16:02.585
How did you even understand that?

16:03.013 --> 16:03.980
Yeah, milk dud...

16:04.130 --> 16:08.191
Is it because you comprehend all
languages and you are a super genius?

16:08.365 --> 16:09.238
That ain't it.

16:09.239 --> 16:12.325
Or is it that you
secretly learned spanish,

16:12.347 --> 16:16.095
so that you could spy on our dear
Carla here right underneath her nose?

16:20.150 --> 16:23.611
- I trusted you.
- That wasn't very smart, was it?

16:27.171 --> 16:28.620
I hope you're happy.

16:32.864 --> 16:33.945
Oh, Bob...

16:36.405 --> 16:38.591
All right! Thank you
for your help, guys.

16:39.494 --> 16:40.381
You too, Lloyd!

16:41.050 --> 16:42.484
Later, dude!

16:44.862 --> 16:47.810
This better be good.

16:49.851 --> 16:52.652
- You understood me!
- I should have told you right away.

16:54.401 --> 16:57.638
Brinner had a lot to do with it.
I love brinner.

16:58.750 --> 17:01.775
- Hello?
- So I should have told you. I'm sorry.

17:03.637 --> 17:05.034
I forgive you.

17:05.994 --> 17:06.844
Excuse me?

17:07.249 --> 17:09.727
The other day, when I missed
that stupid play group meeting and

17:09.770 --> 17:11.410
decided I was a horrible
mother and you told me

17:11.420 --> 17:13.737
not to let a little mistake
erase a good thing...

17:14.421 --> 17:15.885
Remember what I said?

17:16.795 --> 17:19.333
This is gonna come back
to you in a good way.

17:19.971 --> 17:21.285
This is it coming back?

17:21.863 --> 17:25.031
Besides, it must have been really
hard for you to learn spanish.

17:25.123 --> 17:27.156
It was so hard.

17:27.509 --> 17:30.183
And it can be really tough
for you to learn new things.

17:30.461 --> 17:34.013
- I know. I'm so slow.
- Say it in spanish.

17:34.095 --> 17:36.077
Yo soy muy lento.

17:38.256 --> 17:40.493
- Say it again.
- Yo soy muy lento.

17:46.195 --> 17:49.596
I'm going to graduation, to graduation.

17:49.998 --> 17:51.273
- I'm all nervous.
- I can tell.

17:51.283 --> 17:52.850
You're a little bit off key
but don't worry.

17:52.862 --> 17:55.363
- Everything is gonna be just fine.
- Where's Turk?

17:56.328 --> 17:57.220
I don't know...

18:00.485 --> 18:04.096
- Lloyd?
- Just goin' with the vibe, bro.

18:05.125 --> 18:06.597
Okay, buddy. It's time.

18:06.747 --> 18:08.437
I'm gonna take out your I.V.

18:08.691 --> 18:09.923
- How you doing?
- I'm good.

18:10.065 --> 18:11.064
Okay, now...

18:11.462 --> 18:13.738
The morphine I gave you
is gonna kick in soon.

18:15.032 --> 18:17.800
Go just across the stage,
and we're back in the hospital.

18:18.010 --> 18:19.978
- He's up next, guys.
- All right, good luck.

18:20.390 --> 18:23.064
- Ok!
- All right, enjoy it!

18:23.388 --> 18:26.923
<i>Even though we couldn't actually see
Emery walk across and receive his diploma,</i>

18:27.231 --> 18:29.771
<i>I think we all felt like this
is one of our proudest moment.</i>

18:39.908 --> 18:41.545
Yeah, we probably shouldn't
have done that.

18:41.560 --> 18:43.496
At least Emery's mom
got some good pictures.

18:43.819 --> 18:45.816
She said she could always
photoshop out his anguish.

18:48.152 --> 18:51.156
Hey, how come you helped me, even
though I totally ignored your advice?

18:52.094 --> 18:54.129
I don't know.
You were in a crappy situation...

18:54.512 --> 18:55.526
and we're friends.

18:56.171 --> 18:59.288
And yet we only hang out
when we're torturing burn victims.

19:00.475 --> 19:02.608
That's just because we're
both usually seeing someone.

19:03.764 --> 19:05.881
You and I both disappear
when we're in relationships.

19:06.323 --> 19:08.270
All right, you know
what, let's make a pact.

19:08.343 --> 19:11.210
From now on, let promise each
other that we'll always hang out,

19:11.294 --> 19:13.308
even if the other
person's dating someone.

19:13.367 --> 19:14.165
Deal.

19:14.757 --> 19:17.640
But, what if one of us started
dating someone that could be the one?

19:18.463 --> 19:20.531
Oh, we could totally diss
each other if it's the one,

19:20.951 --> 19:22.937
or if it's someone
like preposterously hot.

19:22.938 --> 19:23.549
Agreed.

19:23.767 --> 19:25.179
If I met a hottie, you'd never see me.

19:25.552 --> 19:28.032
Oh. What's the rule if
the person's really fugly,

19:28.092 --> 19:29.960
but really, really easy?

19:30.504 --> 19:32.145
And you know what I love?

19:32.693 --> 19:36.339
That now we can talk about the people
even if they are in the same room.

19:37.436 --> 19:41.746
Like them. I bet you that in five weeks
they will be together again.

19:41.926 --> 19:45.418
Do you think? Some people won't like it.

19:46.363 --> 19:47.318
Yes.

19:50.119 --> 19:52.402
Hey, I gotta go pick up Sam.
You want to come?

19:53.206 --> 19:53.965
Yeah.

19:54.426 --> 19:55.255
As long as you know

19:55.256 --> 19:58.290
that if I don't get to hold him
the whole time I'll probably cry.

20:00.491 --> 20:04.042
<i>I think in the end life is about the
connections we make, and the way...</i>

20:04.508 --> 20:06.618
<i>Oh, my God! What the hell is he doing?</i>

20:10.463 --> 20:11.935
Don't look at me!
