but would you really
feel good about yourself?

00:36.494 --> 00:37.954
All right,
see you later, then.

00:38.038 --> 00:39.539

02:46.374 --> 02:47.417
-Thank you.
-Okay.

02:54.549 --> 02:56.384
This is going to
sound really strange,

02:56.468 --> 02:59.471
but I think you
once came to my school.

02:59.554 --> 03:02.057
It's not strange.
I went to lots of schools.

03:02.140 --> 03:05.018
I was in
the Commonwealth Games.
Dominic McConnell?

03:06.436 --> 03:08.772
I was a swimmer.
I did talks for kids.

03:08.855 --> 03:11.024
Right. I'm Kiera.

03:11.107 --> 03:14.694
You know, two girls
in my class developed
an unseemly thing for you.

03:14.778 --> 03:16.279
Yeah? Who was the other one?

03:16.363 --> 03:19.199
Wow, you're a comedy swimmer.

03:23.703 --> 03:25.955
(GASPS) I did this
sports psychology module once

03:26.039 --> 03:28.333
and I wrote
this essay on women
and exercise addiction.

03:28.416 --> 03:30.502
Like,
is it a real syndrome or...

03:30.585 --> 03:34.047
I just like winning.
That's definitely
a real syndrome.

03:34.130 --> 03:36.299
-Why don't I get
you both a drink?
-Not for me, thanks.

03:36.383 --> 03:37.592

Um,
yeah, no, just orange juice
for me, please.

I'll carry on
with the unpacking.

-Okay.

03:45.016 --> 03:47.435
Nice to meet you, Dominic!

03:47.519 --> 03:50.980
Right, vodka in it, then,
single or double?

03:51.064 --> 03:53.024
-I'd better not.
-Relax!

03:53.108 --> 03:55.110
Vodka never showed
up in a drugs test.

-Are you okay?
-Fine.

up and make my drink

that's quite an introduction.

Yeah,
I'm not embarrassed at all.

04:49.414 --> 04:52.083
She gets up
at 5:00 a.m. to train!

04:52.167 --> 04:54.878
Yeah? I'm thinking tomorrow,
maybe not.

what's the problem here?

05:58.108 --> 06:01.528
We've been drinking,
it's not safe to
be in the pool.

really don't mix.

dress alike,

Glad I took the time
to do your diet sheets.

before a competition.
Well played.

make us feel welcome.

for trying to top herself.

07:45.382 --> 07:48.677
You saw her arms, right?
The scars?

07:48.760 --> 07:51.554
You shouldn't really
make assumptions like that.

Never thought I'd hear
myself say this but...

08:35.181 --> 08:37.558
I really like what you've done
with your room.

Looks like someone
actually lives here.

08:39.894 --> 08:43.148
Mine looks like
a place someone died.

08:43.231 --> 08:45.275
How do you do it?

08:45.358 --> 08:47.444
Try growing up in care.

08:47.527 --> 08:50.196
You learn to make a home
wherever you are.

08:50.280 --> 08:52.949
-Yeah, I'd have
been better off there.
-I'm sure you don't mean that.

-You've never met my family.
-It'd be nice
to have a family.

08:58.371 --> 09:00.248
Hey.

09:00.331 --> 09:04.294

Possibly.

Is that why you
freaked out at the pool?

I did not freak out.

09:34.574 --> 09:37.285

dragged us out of the water.

-Maybe.

disturbed something?

talk about it.

didn't have to come.
-I know.

through other people's things.

10:50.358 --> 10:51.860
Is that awful?

11:00.827 --> 11:02.912
You know, she could come back.

I don't think
there's any
chance of that, Kiera.

11:08.001 --> 11:09.461
Yeah, but she's your daughter.

11:09.544 --> 11:13.006
She's been angry with me
since Jed died.

11:13.089 --> 11:15.633

to get it out in the open.

having this, then?

11:22.015 --> 11:24.017
God, it's nice, actually.

11:24.976 --> 11:26.227
Have it.

Yeah, but me in your
daughter's clothes,

11:33.151 --> 11:36.279

-Stop it.
-I'm sorry.

contracts ready, yeah?

Decided it wasn't
his sort of place after all.

-He must be
living in the building.
-Hmm, so what's your plan?

to slip up and
reveal his identity?

12:32.085 --> 12:36.172

cleverer than I am.

to ease off a bit.

don't over-train.

20:00.700 --> 20:03.119
Activity can be stirred up
by interfering with remains.

20:03.203 --> 20:05.622
-But Cass hasn't
touched any remains.
-Maybe not.

20:05.705 --> 20:08.416
But just by being in a certain
place where something
happened years ago...

20:08.500 --> 20:10.960
All the visions happened
around the pool.

20:11.044 --> 20:13.129
-A girl was
being tortured there.
-There you go.

20:14.297 --> 20:15.965
She's connecting to Cass

20:16.049 --> 20:19.344
and for some reason,
the revenant does
not want her there.

20:19.427 --> 20:21.930
So it's protecting
its territory or something?

20:22.013 --> 20:23.598
-Maybe.
-Why, though?

20:23.682 --> 20:25.016
I don't know.

20:25.100 --> 20:28.687
But first thing we need to do
is warn Cass

20:28.770 --> 20:31.523
and make sure she stays away
from that pool.

20:32.899 --> 20:33.983
Come on, then.

20:38.029 --> 20:40.865
I don't know if this is
a very good idea,
both of us going in.

20:40.949 --> 20:42.617
It might seem a bit weird.

20:42.701 --> 20:44.869
Yeah,
and we'd hate for any of this
to seem weird, right?

20:44.953 --> 20:47.288
-Oh, Max.
-Okay.

20:47.372 --> 20:49.791
(EXHALES)
Look,
just don't seem so nervous.

20:49.874 --> 20:53.044
I'm about to go and tell
a completely sane,
rational girl

20:53.128 --> 20:54.963
that she's
the victim of a haunting.

20:55.046 --> 20:58.216
-What is not to
be nervous about?
-You can do this. All right?

20:58.299 --> 21:00.385
Oh, give me a break.

21:00.468 --> 21:02.929
I'm not talking
about the Ellie
that has visions.

21:03.013 --> 21:06.433
I'm talking about the Ellie
that's just you.

21:06.516 --> 21:09.144
-I mean,
you're good with people.
-Oh, okay, enough.

21:09.227 --> 21:12.105
Yeah, and
obviously a good listener.

21:12.188 --> 21:15.650
To summarize,
just be yourself.

21:15.734 --> 21:17.068
Which one?

21:18.111 --> 21:19.446
Clear off.

21:41.426 --> 21:43.178
(BREATHING SHAKILY)

21:46.181 --> 21:48.016
It looked like you had a fit
or something out there.

21:48.099 --> 21:50.477
No, I'm... I'm fine.

21:51.644 --> 21:52.771
Okay.

21:54.522 --> 21:55.899
So how can I help?

21:57.734 --> 22:01.696
Well, um... The thing is...

22:01.780 --> 22:03.865
Well,
it's a bit awkward but, um...

22:05.784 --> 22:07.619
Well, I'm here 'cause

22:07.702 --> 22:12.999
I'm doing this charity thing,
its' a triathlon but, um...

22:13.083 --> 22:15.585
Well, I need some
tips on how to train.

22:16.336 --> 22:17.462
Okay.

22:24.052 --> 22:26.805
Fancy bumping into
him on a dark night?

22:29.683 --> 22:31.434
-Where did you get these?
-Top floor.

22:31.518 --> 22:33.645
There's tons of this stuff
rotting up there.

22:33.728 --> 22:35.897
Some of the guys
who ran the place here.

22:37.399 --> 22:39.109
Was that your dad?

22:40.985 --> 22:42.070
Yes.

22:43.905 --> 22:47.325
What was he like?

22:47.409 --> 22:49.828
-What are you doing with them?
-I'm going to
e-mail this blogger guy,

22:49.911 --> 22:52.288
pretend I'm
another ghost freak
living in the building.

22:52.372 --> 22:54.165
Only,
I've got things he hasn't.

22:54.249 --> 22:56.334
I mean this
stuff's seriously creepy.
He'll lap it up.

22:56.418 --> 22:58.128
And once he's hooked,
I'll reel him in.

23:00.880 --> 23:02.882
Fine, whatever it takes.

23:07.303 --> 23:09.180
Look, it's been a long week.

23:09.264 --> 23:12.934
I've got
everything covered here.
Why don't you call it a day?

23:13.018 --> 23:14.561
Have some rest.

23:16.813 --> 23:18.857
Yeah, I'll do that.

23:45.717 --> 23:48.636
CASS: I can't remember a time
when I wasn't training.

23:48.720 --> 23:50.889
My dad kind of
bullied me into it.

23:50.972 --> 23:53.141
I moved in with Dominic
as soon as I was old enough.

23:53.224 --> 23:54.934
Didn't that put you off?

23:55.852 --> 23:57.395
No, I loved it.

23:58.605 --> 24:01.149
Once I started winning,

24:01.232 --> 24:02.942
there was nothing like it.

24:03.026 --> 24:08.114
I didn't care that I had to be
in at 9:30 and
that I had no friends.

24:08.198 --> 24:10.533
I'd have done
it 10 times over.

24:11.326 --> 24:13.370
Well, it worked.

24:13.453 --> 24:15.038
Yeah, for a while.

24:15.121 --> 24:16.790
You won't find many
from the last
two years up there.

24:19.459 --> 24:21.836
We had a car crash.

24:21.920 --> 24:24.506
Dom had won gold in some gala

24:24.589 --> 24:26.216
and I was driving him home
on the motorway,

24:26.299 --> 24:28.927
driving way too fast.

24:29.010 --> 24:32.263
We spun around and hit a tree.
Dom broke his shoulder.

24:32.347 --> 24:33.973
But he's all
right now, though,
isn't he?

24:34.057 --> 24:36.059
He never got his
edge back in the pool.

24:36.142 --> 24:37.977
He'd had his sights
set on the Olympics

24:38.061 --> 24:41.147
and suddenly he
couldn't even win
local competitions.

24:41.231 --> 24:42.982
Well, that must have been
tough on both of you.

24:43.066 --> 24:45.860
Yeah, but he never blamed me.

24:45.944 --> 24:48.571
He said I saved him, in a way.

24:48.655 --> 24:52.283
-What do you mean?
-I became like his protÃ©gÃ©.

24:53.410 --> 24:56.579
Now he puts all
his efforts into me.

24:56.663 --> 24:59.541
I've come full circle, really.
First Dad, now Dominic.

25:02.252 --> 25:04.546
Cass, you need to stay away
from that pool.

25:06.131 --> 25:09.134
Why? 'Cause of what happened
with the pool drain?

25:09.217 --> 25:11.011
That's all been sorted out...

25:11.094 --> 25:14.931
I just have
a really strong feeling that
it's not a safe place for you.

25:16.683 --> 25:18.309
Why?

25:18.393 --> 25:21.813
Well,
I don't know for sure but...

25:21.896 --> 25:25.150
I think there's
something down there
that wants to harm you.

25:27.235 --> 25:29.529
(LAUGHS) I'm sorry,
you've lost me.

25:36.703 --> 25:38.455
A ghost.

25:40.457 --> 25:42.792
(LAUGHS) You're kidding,
right?

25:44.919 --> 25:48.173
Please don't dismiss
what I'm saying just 'cause
you think it's weird.

25:48.256 --> 25:50.633
Ellie, listen to yourself.
A ghost?

25:50.717 --> 25:53.011
Please, Cass. I'm serious.
It's not safe down there.

25:53.094 --> 25:54.679
Oh, come on.
I had you down as
one of the grown-ups.

25:54.763 --> 25:58.350
I'm only telling you
what I know to be true.

25:58.433 --> 26:01.353
You do realize you sound
completely insane?

26:20.705 --> 26:22.624
At your boss's desk?

26:25.251 --> 26:27.212
Is Warren about?

26:27.295 --> 26:29.547
-Why?
-Wouldn't you like to know?

26:30.382 --> 26:32.676
Not massively, no.

26:32.759 --> 26:37.305
You're working late.
You must be very
keen to impress.

26:38.640 --> 26:41.351
You're the expert there.

26:41.434 --> 26:44.145
Well,
I'd say if you've settled in
for the night,

26:44.229 --> 26:47.357
your social life
has sadly declined.

26:47.440 --> 26:48.817
(BOTH LAUGH)

26:48.900 --> 26:51.152
Thanks for your concern.

26:51.236 --> 26:53.738
If I get desperate,
I've got your number.

26:54.322 --> 26:56.908
Yeah. Okay.

26:56.991 --> 27:00.745
Um, tell your boss
I'm looking for him,
all right?

28:15.904 --> 28:17.238
(PANTING)

28:17.322 --> 28:18.490
(BEEPS)

28:27.582 --> 28:29.250
(HEAVY BREATHING)

28:37.258 --> 28:38.593
(CLICKING)

28:45.975 --> 28:47.185
(DOOR OPENING)

28:49.062 --> 28:51.731
So, I'm guessing you lost her
at the G-word?

28:51.815 --> 28:54.484
She thinks I'm
a complete fruit loop.

28:57.195 --> 28:58.988
You told her everything?
The visions?

28:59.072 --> 29:01.700
I couldn't.
I couldn't tell her
what I'd just seen.

29:01.783 --> 29:03.868
-It's okay.
-No, it's not!

29:03.952 --> 29:05.370
Max, it was so real.

29:05.453 --> 29:06.955
It was like it was happening
in front of me

29:07.038 --> 29:08.373
and there was nothing
I could do to help.

29:08.456 --> 29:09.582
Hey...

29:09.666 --> 29:11.793
It was in the pool,
just like the others

29:11.876 --> 29:14.170
and she was just
floating there, dead.

29:14.254 --> 29:15.714
And you didn't get a chance
to warn Cass?

29:15.797 --> 29:19.092
She wasn't listening.
What was I supposed to do?

29:19.175 --> 29:20.885
-(DOOR OPENING)
-Max?

29:27.392 --> 29:28.560
(BEEPS)

30:38.797 --> 30:40.799
-Is she there?
-Max!

30:50.058 --> 30:51.309
(COUGHS)

30:58.608 --> 31:00.193
-She's not breathing.
-It's okay.

31:09.369 --> 31:10.662
(SPLUTTERING)

31:10.745 --> 31:12.038
(GASPING)

31:14.374 --> 31:16.584
You've inhaled some water
but you're going to be okay.

31:18.003 --> 31:19.713
What?

31:19.796 --> 31:22.507
I think you must have
passed out in the pool
but you're fine, okay?

31:22.590 --> 31:25.260
Did you see anything
before you passed out?

31:25.343 --> 31:27.429
-Anything?
-Max!

31:27.512 --> 31:29.097
Look, it's all right.
You're safe now.

31:29.180 --> 31:30.432
(COUGHS)

31:33.268 --> 31:35.854
Have you got any
idea what happened?

31:37.856 --> 31:40.567
I think it's your fault,
freaking me out
with all your ghost stories.

31:41.776 --> 31:43.445
How did you even
know I was in trouble?

31:43.528 --> 31:44.988
Just a bad feeling.

31:48.658 --> 31:51.202
I think I saw something
before I passed out.

31:51.286 --> 31:53.121
Did you?

31:53.204 --> 31:55.790
(SIGHS) I must be cracking up.

31:55.874 --> 31:59.919
Maybe you should put
the training aside and just
focus on yourself for a while.

32:00.003 --> 32:02.047
Why do you say that?

32:02.130 --> 32:03.673
It's just the way
you were talking earlier.

32:03.757 --> 32:05.550
It didn't sound like
you had much free time.

32:05.633 --> 32:06.968
Maybe you should talk
to Dominic...

32:07.052 --> 32:08.470
Yeah,
that's going to go down well.

32:08.553 --> 32:11.306
Well, if he loves you,
he'll understand.

32:13.850 --> 32:16.227
Do you want me
to come with you?

32:20.482 --> 32:21.691
(SIGHS)

32:24.402 --> 32:27.614
I don't want my
life to be like this.

32:27.697 --> 32:29.366
I can't do it anymore.

32:29.449 --> 32:33.119
Look, just make sure
you stay out of
that pool, okay?

32:33.787 --> 32:35.288
Get some rest.

32:36.206 --> 32:37.332
Yeah.

32:38.583 --> 32:40.043
Yeah, I will.

32:48.510 --> 32:51.554
-I should have rung.
-No. No, it's fine.

32:54.307 --> 32:56.935
It's quite obviously not fine.

33:01.147 --> 33:02.649
Look, if it's what happened
this morning,

33:02.732 --> 33:04.317
I know I push my
luck sometimes.

33:04.401 --> 33:07.153
It's not that, honestly.

33:10.740 --> 33:12.283
I'm really glad you're here.

33:22.711 --> 33:24.170
-I'll go.
-No.

33:31.302 --> 33:32.929
You wouldn't be
saying any of this
if it wasn't for her.

33:33.013 --> 33:35.098
Well, that's why I'm here.

33:38.727 --> 33:40.520
Two years, for nothing.

33:40.603 --> 33:43.106
But that's exactly how I feel.

33:43.189 --> 33:46.151
I'm really sorry
but I can't pretend anymore.

33:46.234 --> 33:48.737
That's it, okay?
I'm done with swimming.

33:50.405 --> 33:52.115
(BREATHING DEEPLY)

34:06.963 --> 34:09.215
You've got no photos in here.

34:11.176 --> 34:13.553
Nothing that really says
anything about you.

34:13.636 --> 34:16.764
Why do I feel like
you're trying to analyze me?

34:18.975 --> 34:20.435
Because I am.

34:23.813 --> 34:26.900
I've always quite fancied you.

34:26.983 --> 34:28.777
That's a bit wrong, isn't it?

34:32.280 --> 34:33.782
What, do you want me to agree?

34:33.864 --> 34:36.784
Well, you're supposed to be
keeping an eye on
me for my folks.

34:36.868 --> 34:40.455
This is my way of getting back
at them, blah, blah, blah.

34:40.538 --> 34:43.166
Then again, you're not
my first authority figure.

34:43.248 --> 34:45.001
-Oh?
-When I was in sixth form,

34:45.085 --> 34:46.585
teacher at school.

34:46.670 --> 34:48.672
All the kids knew.

34:48.755 --> 34:50.255
I didn't care.

34:51.382 --> 34:53.802
Quite liked it, actually.

34:53.885 --> 34:57.472
And is this just the same?
Sticking it to your parents?

34:59.391 --> 35:00.809
-Honestly?
-Hmm.

35:01.935 --> 35:03.395
I don't know.

35:05.772 --> 35:08.066
But it doesn't
feel like it is.

35:11.569 --> 35:14.072
Do you think this could
ever go anywhere?

35:16.032 --> 35:18.535
I'm probably not
easy to be close to.

35:18.618 --> 35:19.911
Don't say that.

35:19.994 --> 35:22.205
-Why?
-I like a challenge.

35:23.164 --> 35:25.166
It'll only encourage me.

35:35.176 --> 35:39.847
Well, congratulations.
I mean,
you did it all by yourself,

35:39.931 --> 35:42.391
which is,
of course, as you wanted.

35:42.474 --> 35:44.602
How about you let it go?

35:44.686 --> 35:46.271
Just as well
I didn't go round there,
you know?

35:46.354 --> 35:50.232
I would have landed one
on that smug,
controlling dickhead.

35:50.315 --> 35:53.402
(LAUGHS) Max,
he'd have decked you.

35:53.486 --> 35:55.739
Well,
there is that, of course.

35:56.406 --> 35:57.907
Cheers!

35:59.658 --> 36:00.743
Mmm.

36:06.124 --> 36:09.127
Max,
I need to show you something.

36:09.210 --> 36:12.005
But I need you not to think
it's weird. And if you do
think it's weird,

36:12.088 --> 36:14.132
-then I need you
not to freak out.
-All right.

36:14.214 --> 36:16.300
The not freaking out part
is really important.

36:16.383 --> 36:18.927
How about you just show me?

36:29.272 --> 36:32.233
I've had it for as long
as I can remember.

36:32.317 --> 36:34.402
Okay.

36:34.486 --> 36:38.865
I keep seeing it, the same
symbol, in the visions.
What does it mean?

36:43.411 --> 36:46.456
-Max, will you say something,
please?
-Um...

36:47.665 --> 36:49.417
I've seen this
in the building.

36:51.711 --> 36:55.090
It must mean you're connected
to it in...in some way.

36:55.465 --> 36:56.549
How?

36:59.094 --> 37:00.720
Can I, uh...

37:10.605 --> 37:12.482
-I'm sorry.
-It's okay.

37:17.946 --> 37:20.990
This isn't about you and me,
Dom, this is about
the training, that's all.

37:21.074 --> 37:23.118
That's all? Just everything
we've built our lives on.

37:23.201 --> 37:25.662
-It isn't everything.
-Right, so, so what?

37:25.745 --> 37:28.081
You love me, do you?
'Cause I'm really feeling it.

37:28.164 --> 37:31.209
-Of course I love you.
-Of course you do.

37:31.292 --> 37:33.753
You've destroyed my life once
and now you're doing it again.

37:33.837 --> 37:35.463
You don't mean that.

37:35.547 --> 37:37.215
You're just
saying it to hurt me.

37:37.298 --> 37:40.343
Yeah, well,
you'd know all about that,
wouldn't you?

37:40.427 --> 37:43.054
-Dom...
-What do you want
me to say, Cass, huh?

37:43.138 --> 37:45.390
That it wasn't your fault?
That I don't
resent you for it?

37:45.473 --> 37:47.892
Well, it was your fault.
You did this to me.

37:47.976 --> 37:50.353
If you really felt like that
then you would have
said it at the time.

37:50.437 --> 37:52.522
How could I?
You never gave me the chance.

37:52.605 --> 37:55.066
You beat me to it
with your little cry for help.

37:55.150 --> 37:57.360
That's not what it
was and you know it.

37:57.444 --> 37:59.029
What was it, then?

37:59.112 --> 38:01.114
Just another thing
you didn't have the guts
to follow through with?

38:01.197 --> 38:02.949
Story of your life.

38:06.494 --> 38:08.329
How can you say that?

38:09.748 --> 38:12.876
Just get out.
I can't even look at you.

38:20.884 --> 38:22.135
(TYPING)

38:40.737 --> 38:42.280
(LAPTOP CHIMES)

39:32.372 --> 39:34.499
Max, she killed herself.

39:34.582 --> 39:35.834
The ghost cut her wrists

39:35.917 --> 39:38.044
and now she's going to do
the same to Cass.

39:58.064 --> 40:00.316
What's it going to do to her?

40:43.610 --> 40:44.903
(SCREAMS)

40:50.617 --> 40:52.327
(GARBLED SCREAMING)

41:00.710 --> 41:02.003
(GASPING)

41:34.661 --> 41:35.787
Oh...

41:51.845 --> 41:52.971
Cass?

42:36.639 --> 42:38.600
What have we done?

42:38.683 --> 42:41.186
We let that happen.

42:41.269 --> 42:43.396
If it happens,
it's not our fault.

42:43.480 --> 42:44.814
We thought she was safe.

42:49.069 --> 42:50.612
We're learning.

42:51.613 --> 42:53.406
No, we could have saved her.

42:57.327 --> 43:00.205
Max, what we're dealing with
is dangerous.

43:00.288 --> 43:02.040
Jed died and now Cass.

43:15.970 --> 43:17.263
Who's next?
