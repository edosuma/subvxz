08:32.020 --> 08:33.160
- But I could eat a horse.

08:33.160 --> 08:35.190
- (chuckles) I would
not say that too loud.

08:35.190 --> 08:37.150
Some of these people
might actually own horses.

08:37.150 --> 08:39.150
- (gasps) Really?
Can I ride one?

08:41.020 --> 08:43.010

if you're lucky.

- Oh my God.

08:47.200 --> 08:49.200
How many years has it been?

a rough few days.

09:02.180 --> 09:04.060
I'm already getting stared at.

09:05.100 --> 09:06.140

09:09.030 --> 09:11.000
(Amy blows kiss)

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
Stop. You're gonna get me fired.

- Sorry. (chuckles)

09:15.070 --> 09:16.120

09:20.100 --> 09:21.200

cheeseburger, please?

09:23.140 --> 09:26.090

09:26.090 --> 09:29.050
I'll tell you what, I'll
get that going for you.

20:48.100 --> 20:50.030
- Oh shit, man,
she's looking qt you.

20:50.030 --> 20:51.000
- Okay. All right.

20:53.180 --> 20:55.060
- What'd you say to me?

20:55.060 --> 20:57.090
- I said, how much for a night?

20:57.090 --> 20:58.180
We can just jump in
the back of my truck,

20:58.180 --> 21:00.020
if you're short on time.

21:00.020 --> 21:02.090
(both laugh)

21:02.090 --> 21:04.080
- How much you got?
- Excuse me?

21:05.050 --> 21:06.200
- Did I Sutter?

21:06.200 --> 21:09.030
- Oh, shit, dude. (laughs)

21:09.030 --> 21:11.160
- You serious? You serious?

21:11.160 --> 21:13.210
- You got a hearing problem
or you just fucking stupid?

21:13.210 --> 21:15.180
- All right. Jesus.

21:15.180 --> 21:18.030
Shit. Got a mouth on you.

21:18.030 --> 21:20.010
- Mm, you have no idea.

21:20.010 --> 21:22.020
- I got the cash to find out.

21:22.020 --> 21:23.140
- Consider that your
fee for the cat call.

21:23.140 --> 21:25.170
- Now wait a goddamn
minute, you...

21:25.170 --> 21:27.050
- Feel that?
(trucker gasps)

21:27.050 --> 21:28.190
That's me seconds
away from cutting off

21:28.190 --> 21:30.080
your micro-penis and
shoving it so far up

21:30.080 --> 21:31.220
your MAGA-loving ass
that you can taste it.

21:31.220 --> 21:34.200
- Hey, look, it was a
compliment. I'm sorry.

21:34.200 --> 21:36.110
- Tell you what, partner.

21:36.110 --> 21:38.010
Why don't I leave you
just a little reminder

21:38.010 --> 21:40.020
in case you decide to
pull that shit again.

21:40.020 --> 21:41.140
(knife stabs)
- Oh, fuck!

21:41.140 --> 21:42.200
God! You bitch.

21:44.200 --> 21:46.100
Oh fuck!

21:46.100 --> 21:47.200
- Let me see.

21:47.200 --> 21:49.200
(blade clicks)
- I didn't know enough.

21:49.200 --> 21:51.070
Fuck.

21:51.070 --> 21:54.000
(keys jangling)

22:02.170 --> 22:05.040
(Judith exhales)

22:05.040 --> 22:06.130
(engine starting)

22:06.130 --> 22:09.090
(hard rock music)

22:10.110 --> 22:13.110
(crickets chirping)

22:14.220 --> 22:17.160
(fire crackling)

22:46.040 --> 22:49.080
(doorknob clattering)

22:58.230 --> 23:01.050
(whirring)

23:08.140 --> 23:11.020
(eerie music)

23:38.070 --> 23:41.150
(eerie music continues)

23:55.050 --> 23:58.040
(lighter clicking)

24:16.060 --> 24:19.060
(suspenseful music)

24:41.220 --> 24:45.200
(intense music)
(mug clinking)

24:45.200 --> 24:48.120
(door slams)
- Let me outta here!

24:48.120 --> 24:50.060
Let me out! Mom, Mom!

24:51.190 --> 24:53.070
- Adrian.
- Let me out!

24:53.070 --> 24:54.180
- Adrian!

24:54.180 --> 24:56.180
Adrian!
- Mom, Mom, Mom!

24:57.210 --> 24:59.090
Let me out!
- Adrian,

24:59.090 --> 25:01.020
Mommy will save
you, baby. (grunts)

25:01.020 --> 25:02.060
- Mom!

25:02.060 --> 25:05.120
- Come here. (breathes heavily)

25:05.120 --> 25:07.080
What were you doing down there?

25:08.100 --> 25:09.230
I told you not to go down there.

25:09.230 --> 25:11.160
- Mom, there's
someone down there.

25:12.160 --> 25:13.120
- What?

25:14.110 --> 25:16.020
(whirring)

25:16.020 --> 25:18.160
(Amy panting)

25:25.000 --> 25:26.140
There's nothing down here, baby.

25:28.100 --> 25:29.120
- I saw something.

25:32.180 --> 25:33.200
- Did you light these?

25:37.040 --> 25:38.070
Give me the lighter.

25:45.110 --> 25:47.230
(Amy blowing)

25:55.200 --> 25:56.160
Come on.

26:05.050 --> 26:07.170
(eerie music)

26:23.200 --> 26:26.080
(Amy yawning)

26:46.180 --> 26:48.110
(Amy kisses)

26:48.110 --> 26:51.180
(window slides and bangs)

26:51.180 --> 26:54.180
(suspenseful music)

27:24.150 --> 27:28.120
(suspenseful music continues)

27:32.150 --> 27:35.090
(birds chirping)

27:51.160 --> 27:52.220
(Amy sighs)

27:52.220 --> 27:55.100
(lock clicks)

27:56.080 --> 27:59.110
(soft dramatic music)

28:20.060 --> 28:22.160
(hand slaps)

28:25.050 --> 28:29.150
(Amy's Mother
yelling indistinctly)

28:32.110 --> 28:34.080
- Mom.

28:37.160 --> 28:38.120
Are you okay?

28:39.220 --> 28:42.090
- Hey, sweetie.
Yeah, mm, I'm fine.

28:44.080 --> 28:46.150
(Amy chuckles)

28:46.150 --> 28:49.000
This house just has
a lot of memories.

28:49.000 --> 28:50.050
- Grandma and grandpa?

28:51.040 --> 28:52.170
- Yeah.

28:52.170 --> 28:54.100
- I really wish I
could have met them.

28:55.130 --> 28:56.090
- Me too.

28:57.190 --> 28:59.090
(knocking on door)
- I'll get it.

28:59.090 --> 29:00.050
- Adrian.

29:05.170 --> 29:07.100
(ominous music)

29:07.100 --> 29:12.060
(wind whistling)
(curtain rustling)

29:12.060 --> 29:15.100
(knocking continues)

29:21.140 --> 29:23.210
- Hey, Mommy's friend.
- Hey, kiddo.

29:23.210 --> 29:26.090
- Hey.
- Hey. (chuckles)

29:26.090 --> 29:28.000
Brought groceries.
- Wow.

29:28.000 --> 29:29.130
When you said some groceries,

29:29.130 --> 29:31.020
I didn't think you
meant that many.

29:31.020 --> 29:33.130
- Oh, there's more
in the car, so.

29:33.130 --> 29:35.020
- Here let me help.

29:35.020 --> 29:37.020
You wanna go get
some from the car?

29:37.020 --> 29:39.210
- Mm.

29:39.210 --> 29:42.100
(Amy takes deep breath)

29:42.100 --> 29:43.060
Does he know?

29:46.200 --> 29:48.080
- Know what?

29:49.100 --> 29:50.200
- What happened here?

29:50.200 --> 29:53.220
(suspenseful music)

29:56.130 --> 29:57.220
I take that as a no.

30:02.010 --> 30:06.010
- Timing hasn't really
been great recently.

30:08.010 --> 30:11.090
All he knows is that his grandad
died and left us the house.

30:13.010 --> 30:15.120
- When was the last
time you talked to him?

30:15.120 --> 30:17.200
Your dad. Did you talk
to him before he passed?

30:19.190 --> 30:20.150
- No.

30:22.010 --> 30:24.120
- When was the last
time you talked to him?

30:24.120 --> 30:28.090
- (chuckles) You're full
of questions today, huh?

30:31.200 --> 30:33.080
(liquor sloshes)

30:33.080 --> 30:34.040
- Talk to me.

30:38.080 --> 30:40.000
(both laughing)

30:40.000 --> 30:42.010
Slow down on that stuff.

30:44.070 --> 30:46.020
Oh, oh.
- Oh.

30:47.040 --> 30:49.150
That's the Amy I remember.

30:49.150 --> 30:52.140
- Oh, the excessively
drunk one, huh? (chuckles)

30:52.140 --> 30:55.020
- No. The happy one.

30:56.220 --> 30:58.220
- You're just trying to get me
drunk so I spill my secrets.

30:58.220 --> 31:01.070
- (sighs) I'm just
trying to figure out

31:01.070 --> 31:03.230
what's going on with you.
(Amy sighs)

31:03.230 --> 31:06.030
You leave town after
your dad's trial.

31:07.170 --> 31:11.160
You don't send me a
text, call. Nothing.

31:14.080 --> 31:16.110
Do you keep in
contact with anyone?

31:19.010 --> 31:22.000
I know Eric was asking
about you. (chuckles)

31:22.000 --> 31:23.170
- Eric Salinda?

31:23.170 --> 31:26.130
From high school?
- Yeah, man.

31:26.130 --> 31:28.150
- Ooh.
- He loved you.

31:28.150 --> 31:30.080
- Oh-ho. Mm.
(Jenny laughing)

31:30.080 --> 31:32.140
- I think he's still single.

31:32.140 --> 31:34.060
- And there's probably
a reason for that.

31:34.060 --> 31:36.180
(both laugh)

31:38.170 --> 31:39.140
Cut the shit.

31:43.110 --> 31:44.120
- It's, um...

31:48.230 --> 31:51.000
- (sighs) Come on.

31:52.160 --> 31:55.130
I care about you.
You can talk to me.

31:58.100 --> 32:00.120
- We just didn't have
anywhere else to go.

32:02.040 --> 32:04.070
- Who are you running from?

32:04.070 --> 32:07.120
- Huh. Um...

32:09.230 --> 32:11.040
Her name's Judith.

32:12.180 --> 32:15.150
- Judith? Okay.

32:17.120 --> 32:18.100
Who's Judith?

32:22.080 --> 32:23.070
- Adrian's mom.

32:26.090 --> 32:27.210
- But you are Adrian's mom.

32:27.210 --> 32:31.010
- His other mom.

32:32.210 --> 32:33.170
- Oh. Oh.

32:35.180 --> 32:36.140
- Yeah.

32:38.010 --> 32:40.060
Good Old Kathy
would've should a brick

32:40.060 --> 32:42.220
if she was still alive.
- (laughs) Would've loved

32:42.220 --> 32:44.090
to see her face.
- Hmm-hmm.

32:45.170 --> 32:48.190
No, you would not. (chuckles)

32:48.190 --> 32:52.030
- So you and Judith
adopted Adrian together?

32:54.000 --> 32:55.110
- Yeah, we got lucky.

32:57.160 --> 32:58.140
I got lucky.

33:00.020 --> 33:01.190
- So why are you
running from her?

33:04.030 --> 33:07.100
(Amy sniffs and sighs)

33:08.120 --> 33:11.040
- Holy shit. Are you okay?

33:11.040 --> 33:14.040
- Yeah, just had a, had
a little bit of a fight.

33:15.060 --> 33:17.040
- Do you need to see a doctor?

33:17.040 --> 33:18.180
- I'm fine, it's healing.
- Are you sure?

33:18.180 --> 33:23.020
(exhales) So this Judith
is a bit cray cray?

33:23.020 --> 33:26.180
- Yeah, would've, uh, given
Kathy a run for her money.

33:26.180 --> 33:27.230
- Wow.

33:27.230 --> 33:29.150
(Amy laughs)

33:29.150 --> 33:30.110
- What?

33:31.210 --> 33:33.110
- Didn't you just say cray cray?

33:34.220 --> 33:36.170
- Isn't that what the
kids say these days?

33:36.170 --> 33:38.060
- I have no idea.

33:38.060 --> 33:39.220
(both laugh)

33:39.220 --> 33:41.220
- I'm trying to be serious.

33:41.220 --> 33:43.030
- Sorry. I'm sorry.

33:44.040 --> 33:47.080
(both chuckle)

33:47.080 --> 33:48.230
Fuck. I have missed you.

33:48.230 --> 33:51.100
- (chuckles) I missed you too.

33:58.070 --> 34:00.180
- I'm so fucking sorry for
coming back into your life

34:00.180 --> 34:03.040
a complete shit
show of a disaster.

34:03.040 --> 34:07.000
- Hmm, oh. It's okay. (chuckles)

34:07.000 --> 34:10.080
It was getting kind of
boring around here anyways.

34:10.080 --> 34:11.220
Needed some added spice.

34:11.220 --> 34:12.180
- Like I...

34:14.140 --> 34:17.000
shouldn't having
me just unloading

34:17.000 --> 34:18.070
all of my baggage onto you.

34:18.070 --> 34:19.200
You have your own life.

34:21.140 --> 34:24.220
- Look, I wouldn't be
here if I didn't wanna be.

34:27.060 --> 34:30.010
- (inhales) Thank you.

34:34.150 --> 34:39.150
(both chuckle)
(glass clink)

34:40.100 --> 34:42.080
(Jenny exhales)

34:42.080 --> 34:43.200
Hey, I, um,

34:43.200 --> 34:45.100
I really appreciate
you coming by

34:45.100 --> 34:47.140
and basically feeding
us for the next month.

34:47.140 --> 34:50.080
- Oh, it's what I'm
here for. (chuckles)

34:50.080 --> 34:54.050
- Um, I actually have
something for you. Just...

35:04.100 --> 35:05.140
(Jenny laughs)
(Amy exhales)

35:05.140 --> 35:07.100
Found it in the basement.

35:07.100 --> 35:09.050
- Look at us. Uh.

35:10.070 --> 35:12.010
- It's like peas in a pod.

35:12.010 --> 35:13.040
- Something like that.

35:13.040 --> 35:15.000
(both chuckle)

35:15.000 --> 35:19.040
(sighs) Well, I
better get going.

35:19.040 --> 35:20.160
Hubby's gonna be calling soon.

35:26.120 --> 35:29.050
(soft dramatic music)

35:29.050 --> 35:33.200
Well, I will be back in a few
days to check on you guys.

35:33.200 --> 35:34.160
- Sounds good.

35:36.000 --> 35:36.200
Drive safely.

35:38.200 --> 35:41.110
(exhales) Fuck.

35:41.110 --> 35:43.230
(pounds fist)

35:47.080 --> 35:50.030
(fire crackling)

35:51.140 --> 35:54.130
- Mom, why are we always
sleeping on the floor?

35:55.140 --> 35:57.190
(Amy takes deep breath)

35:57.190 --> 36:00.090
- I guess I should get
a mattress. Shouldn't I?

36:00.090 --> 36:01.130
- That would be cozier.

36:03.200 --> 36:04.190
- I'll get on that.

36:06.070 --> 36:07.220
See if I can get one
from Jenny tomorrow.

36:09.170 --> 36:11.170
- I wish there was one in
the bedroom that we can use.

36:11.170 --> 36:14.100
- Mm, no, that one was
tossed out years ago.

36:15.150 --> 36:17.010
- Was it gross?

36:17.010 --> 36:20.100
(soft dramatic music)

36:20.100 --> 36:22.130
- It had cooties.
- Ew.

36:22.130 --> 36:24.200
- (chuckles) Yeah.

36:24.200 --> 36:26.130
Now go to sleep.

36:26.130 --> 36:28.130
- Okay, Mom. I love you.

36:28.130 --> 36:32.160
(soft dramatic music continues)

36:42.080 --> 36:44.070
(fire crackling)

36:44.070 --> 36:47.070
(crickets chirping)

37:13.090 --> 37:16.110
(suspenseful music)

37:38.230 --> 37:39.190
Hello?

37:42.180 --> 37:43.180
Who are you?

37:45.100 --> 37:47.050
How'd you get in here?

37:48.070 --> 37:50.060
Get out, get out my house!

37:51.140 --> 37:53.050
Get out!

37:53.050 --> 37:54.220
Go away!
(Amy gasps)

37:54.220 --> 37:56.030
Stop!

37:56.030 --> 37:57.130
- Adrian!
- Stop!

37:57.130 --> 37:59.230
Get out of my house! Go away!

38:01.050 --> 38:03.090
Stop! Get out of my house!

38:04.200 --> 38:06.010
Get out of my house!
- Adrian, Adrian,

38:06.010 --> 38:07.150
who's here?
- Get out!

38:07.150 --> 38:09.210
- Baby, wake up, wake up!
- Get out!

38:09.210 --> 38:11.030
- Baby, what's wrong?

38:12.150 --> 38:15.000
- There was someone right there.

38:15.000 --> 38:17.080
- Baby, baby,
there's no one there.

38:17.080 --> 38:18.040
It's okay.

38:19.150 --> 38:22.100
We're alone. You're safe.

38:22.100 --> 38:25.100

38:36.170 --> 38:38.090

38:47.210 --> 38:51.010

39:53.200 --> 39:56.060
(gun clacks)

39:59.050 --> 40:01.120
(gun fires)

40:01.120 --> 40:03.110
- You gonna teach
me how to hunt?

40:03.110 --> 40:04.170
- Sure. Come here for a sec.

40:04.170 --> 40:07.060
(gun clacks)

40:07.060 --> 40:11.020
Okay. Now stand about there.

40:12.000 --> 40:13.090
See the target?

40:13.090 --> 40:15.100
Okay. Little bit down.

40:16.090 --> 40:17.060
Perfect.

40:19.000 --> 40:21.050
You're gonna gently put
your finger on the trigger.

40:21.050 --> 40:22.180
(gun fires)

40:22.180 --> 40:24.130
(dog barking)

40:24.130 --> 40:27.060
Oh, hey, it's okay.
It's okay, come here.

40:27.060 --> 40:28.060
We'll just do it one more time.

40:28.060 --> 40:29.200
- I don't want to.

40:29.200 --> 40:31.000
- Oh, come on baby. It's easy.

40:31.000 --> 40:32.010
Let's do it one more time.

40:32.010 --> 40:32.210
- No.

40:32.210 --> 40:34.190
(tense music)

40:34.190 --> 40:36.070
- Get over here. Oh.

40:41.040 --> 40:44.120
(Amy takes deep breath)

40:45.100 --> 40:50.090
Hey, I'm sorry, okay?

40:50.090 --> 40:55.080
I just, just wanna be
able to protect you.

40:55.080 --> 40:56.060
- From her?

40:59.080 --> 41:01.020
- Yeah, from her,

41:02.160 --> 41:05.020
or anyone else who
might try to hurt you

41:05.020 --> 41:06.080
or take you away from me.

41:08.150 --> 41:09.110
- Okay.

41:10.180 --> 41:13.050
- Yeah? Okay.

41:14.100 --> 41:16.120
(gun clacks)

41:16.120 --> 41:17.100
You ready? Here.

41:19.190 --> 41:21.090
Stand a little bit more down.

41:22.160 --> 41:26.080
And whenever you're ready.

41:26.080 --> 41:28.130
(gun fires)

41:28.130 --> 41:30.160
Baby, that was amazing!

41:30.160 --> 41:33.100
Nice shot! Baby, you did it!

41:33.100 --> 41:36.070
(suspenseful music)
That is awesome.

41:36.070 --> 41:37.090
Let's go check it out.

41:43.100 --> 41:46.120
(crickets chirping)

41:50.000 --> 41:51.070
There you go, sweetie.

41:56.050 --> 41:57.190
Eat up.

41:57.190 --> 41:59.090
- I'm just not that hungry.

42:02.190 --> 42:04.020
- Baby, you love chicken.

42:12.030 --> 42:14.210
You know, we're really
lucky to have this food.

42:14.210 --> 42:16.130
- I know.
- Then eat.

42:31.100 --> 42:34.000
- You think she's
coming here, don't you?

42:34.000 --> 42:36.030
That's why you have the gun.

42:36.030 --> 42:38.070
She's gonna take me away.

42:38.070 --> 42:40.010
- Eat your fucking food.

42:40.010 --> 42:42.020
(tense music)

42:42.020 --> 42:43.110
Adrian, come back here.

42:44.210 --> 42:47.050
(Amy sighs)

43:13.040 --> 43:16.120
(tense music continues)

43:36.160 --> 43:39.140
(plate clattering)

43:45.010 --> 43:49.020
(door opens and creaks)

43:49.020 --> 43:52.020
(suspenseful music)

44:00.110 --> 44:03.010
(door creaks)

44:23.080 --> 44:24.040
Adrian.

44:26.100 --> 44:29.040
(switch clicks)

44:30.150 --> 44:32.070
Bubba, I'm sorry
I snapped at you.

44:40.100 --> 44:42.040
Turn around, I'm talking to you.

44:43.060 --> 44:45.120
(Amy gasping and groaning)

44:45.120 --> 44:49.150
(slapping and cracking)

44:49.150 --> 44:51.040
- Mom!

44:51.040 --> 44:52.160
(Amy groaning)
Stop!

44:52.160 --> 44:54.100
(thumping)

44:54.100 --> 44:57.020
(intense music)

45:08.190 --> 45:10.150
(birds chirping)

45:10.150 --> 45:13.130
(chimes jingling)

45:36.040 --> 45:37.080
- Hey, baby.

45:38.050 --> 45:39.010
- Hey, Mom.

45:41.090 --> 45:42.070
- Oh, fuck.

45:48.130 --> 45:49.170
What happened?

45:52.190 --> 45:54.040
Adrian, what happened?

45:55.100 --> 45:56.230
- You don't remember?

45:56.230 --> 45:59.110
(tense music)

46:01.230 --> 46:06.050
(Amy groans and
breathes uneasily)

46:10.190 --> 46:15.200
(finger cracking)
(Amy gasping)

46:19.130 --> 46:22.160
(tense music)

46:22.160 --> 46:26.020
(Amy breathes uneasily)

46:33.110 --> 46:37.100
- The last thing I remember
was chasing you in here.

46:37.100 --> 46:41.130
(tense music continues)

46:41.130 --> 46:43.230
(Amy sighs)

46:47.130 --> 46:48.110
Thank you, baby.

47:04.160 --> 47:07.220
(Amy sighs)

47:07.220 --> 47:08.180
Adrian.

47:15.010 --> 47:16.210
What happened last night?

47:16.210 --> 47:17.190
- I don't know.

47:19.030 --> 47:20.060
- Who did this to me?

47:22.200 --> 47:25.100
Tell me.
- Stop, you're hurting me!

47:25.100 --> 47:28.000
(eerie music)

47:30.080 --> 47:31.080
- I'm sorry.

47:35.050 --> 47:38.230
Was someone in our house? Who?

47:40.010 --> 47:42.010
- I, I could barely see them.

47:43.050 --> 47:44.090
- Mean you can barely see them?

47:44.090 --> 47:45.210
You were in the room with me.

47:47.100 --> 47:48.180
- They were hard to see.

47:50.230 --> 47:52.230
- Have you seen them
in the house before?

47:57.200 --> 47:59.230
(sighs) Must be a
squatter or something.

47:59.230 --> 48:01.130
- Squatter?

48:01.130 --> 48:03.130
- Yeah, hey have to
be getting in somehow.

48:04.220 --> 48:05.180
- Mom.

48:07.050 --> 48:08.190
- What?

48:08.190 --> 48:09.210
- I wanna leave.

48:12.060 --> 48:15.070
- And where the hell
are we gonna go, Adrian?

48:15.070 --> 48:18.080
We are miles away from town.
My phone is smashed to shit.

48:18.080 --> 48:20.150
So no, we're not
fucking leaving!

48:20.150 --> 48:21.150
We're stuck!

48:21.150 --> 48:24.030
(tense music)

48:30.220 --> 48:33.180
(hammer banging)

48:37.010 --> 48:41.010
(sighs) Okay, I don't want you
coming in this room anymore.

48:41.010 --> 48:43.050
And do not answer the
front door for anyone.

48:43.050 --> 48:44.190
Even Jenny.

48:44.190 --> 48:45.190
- I promise.

48:46.210 --> 48:47.220
- I'm gonna keep us safe.

48:49.000 --> 48:52.070
(dog barking in distance)

48:52.070 --> 48:57.070
(eerie music)
(water trickling)

49:10.170 --> 49:12.230
- You didn't wash your
face like I asked.

49:12.230 --> 49:14.190
- I'm sorry, Mom.

49:14.190 --> 49:17.070
- I know, but you
always say you're sorry

49:17.070 --> 49:19.060
after I've asked
you a hundred times.

49:19.060 --> 49:20.080
- Are you mad?

49:21.180 --> 49:22.150
- I'm not mad.

49:24.100 --> 49:26.140
- I want you to remember
something very important.

49:28.070 --> 49:32.180
It's my job to keep
you well-fed, clean,

49:32.180 --> 49:34.200
obedient and beautiful.

49:36.020 --> 49:37.200
Beauty's a fragile thing.

49:37.200 --> 49:40.150
Like porcelain doll
or a China plate.

49:42.030 --> 49:44.020
One false move and it
can all just shatter.

49:44.020 --> 49:47.100
(eerie music continues)

49:52.090 --> 49:55.050
(water trickling)

49:58.160 --> 50:01.060
(faucet thuds)

50:07.000 --> 50:09.220
(knocking on door)

50:21.210 --> 50:25.010
(knocking continues)

50:29.060 --> 50:31.170
- Who is it?
- It's Jenny.

50:31.170 --> 50:33.210
Open the door.
It's hot out here.

50:37.170 --> 50:39.230
- Hey.
- Hey, you guys okay?

50:39.230 --> 50:41.200
I've been trying to call.

50:41.200 --> 50:43.160
I was on my way to work,
so I figured I'd stop by.

50:43.160 --> 50:45.220
- Oh, um, yeah.
Uh, my phone broke.

50:45.220 --> 50:47.150
(chuckles nervously) Sorry.

50:47.150 --> 50:50.060
- Are you, are you okay?

50:50.060 --> 50:52.040
- Oh yeah. Yeah,
we're, we're fine.

50:53.230 --> 50:55.180
- I know when you're being
a total bullshit artist.

51:00.110 --> 51:03.080
Holy shit. What happened?

51:03.080 --> 51:05.210
- It's fine. It's just
some bruises, seriously.

51:08.100 --> 51:11.080
- Be honest with
me. Was she here?

51:11.080 --> 51:13.170
- No, no. Uh, no, no.

51:13.170 --> 51:15.150
My, my clumsy ass
just fell off a ladder

51:15.150 --> 51:17.160
fixing some lights in
the master bedroom.

51:19.100 --> 51:20.220
I did have some of that
Wild Turkey you brought by,

51:20.220 --> 51:24.080
but you know, my
face broke the fall.

51:26.130 --> 51:28.210
I am kind of saying that
it was inadvertently

51:28.210 --> 51:30.110
your fault from the...

51:33.040 --> 51:34.180
That was a joke.

51:34.180 --> 51:35.220
- Is that what happened?

51:39.160 --> 51:42.000
- Um, we were actually
about to sit down

51:42.000 --> 51:44.010
and have some dinner,
beef casserole.

51:45.030 --> 51:46.160
- I'm gonna be late for work.

51:46.160 --> 51:48.200
I was just stopping
to check on you guys.

51:48.200 --> 51:50.030
- Yeah. Yeah, okay.

51:51.110 --> 51:52.210
- Thank you for the offer.

51:54.060 --> 51:56.000
Lay off the Wild Turkey.

51:56.000 --> 51:57.020
(Amy chuckles)
Okay?

51:58.150 --> 51:59.100
- Yes, ma'am.

52:00.120 --> 52:01.160
- I'll be back in a few days

52:01.160 --> 52:03.040
with a new burner phone for you.

52:03.040 --> 52:04.080
I don't like you
guys being out here

52:04.080 --> 52:05.080
without a way to call anyone.

52:05.080 --> 52:06.130
- (chuckles) Thank you.

52:08.070 --> 52:10.170
- All right. Bye.

52:10.170 --> 52:11.130
- Bye.

52:15.200 --> 52:20.190
(Amy exhales)
(tense music)

52:20.190 --> 52:23.130
(birds chirping)

52:38.120 --> 52:41.130
(door closes)

52:41.130 --> 52:44.050
(ominous music)

52:51.230 --> 52:54.210
(traffic whirring)

52:59.170 --> 53:03.090
(suspenseful music)

53:03.090 --> 53:06.050
(car door closes)

53:07.210 --> 53:10.200
(lighter clicking)

53:17.170 --> 53:20.170
(crickets chirping)

53:22.200 --> 53:24.150
(customers chattering)

53:24.150 --> 53:26.070
- Hey, Grace. (chuckles)

53:26.070 --> 53:29.090
(upbeat rock music)

53:30.110 --> 53:32.080
What would you like to order?

53:32.080 --> 53:35.210
- I'll have the French toast,
side of bacon and a coffee.

53:35.210 --> 53:37.150
- Cream, sugar.

53:37.150 --> 53:39.060
- Black, sugar.

53:42.030 --> 53:43.220
- I'll go get that for ya.

53:43.220 --> 53:44.180
- Mm-hmm.

53:48.080 --> 53:51.100
(suspenseful music)

53:57.130 --> 54:00.150
- (sighs) Here you go.
Black, like you like it.

54:00.150 --> 54:02.080
- Hmm, thanks.

54:02.080 --> 54:04.170
- (chuckles) Your food
will be out a minute.

54:04.170 --> 54:06.120
- Mm. No rush.

54:06.120 --> 54:08.050
I'm just enjoying
people watching.

54:11.120 --> 54:12.200
- Not much to watch.

54:14.010 --> 54:14.230
- See, I disagree.

54:19.210 --> 54:21.010
- Okay.

54:21.010 --> 54:24.120
(upbeat rock music continues)

54:26.150 --> 54:29.150
(suspenseful music)

54:36.120 --> 54:39.050
(rain pattering)

54:40.130 --> 54:43.230
(fork taps and scrapes)

54:49.090 --> 54:51.030
- Don't play with
your food, buddy.

54:54.180 --> 54:56.100
You don't like it. Do you?

54:58.180 --> 54:59.170
- Not really.

55:01.200 --> 55:03.180
- Yeah, me neither.

55:05.100 --> 55:07.080
Kind of tastes like shit.

55:07.080 --> 55:09.080
- Yeah, horseshit.

55:09.080 --> 55:12.120
- Ah, excuse me, language.

55:12.120 --> 55:14.090
- What? You say it all the time.

55:17.070 --> 55:19.100
- You're right. I do.

55:20.170 --> 55:22.030
How about a Popsicle instead?

55:25.140 --> 55:26.190
(freezer opens)

55:26.190 --> 55:29.210
(Popsicle rustling)

55:33.160 --> 55:34.190
There you go. Go on.

55:37.030 --> 55:38.200
You can thank Aunt
Jenny for that.

55:42.110 --> 55:45.110
(suspenseful music)

55:52.140 --> 55:57.150
(The Woman snarling)
(Amy gasping and choking)

56:02.140 --> 56:03.140
- Mom! Stop!

56:04.160 --> 56:08.190
(Amy continues choking)

56:08.190 --> 56:10.130
(Amy gasping)

56:10.130 --> 56:15.130
(intense music)
(wind howling)

56:16.110 --> 56:19.100
- Uh, dammit! (panting)

56:19.100 --> 56:22.120
(Amy grunting)

56:22.120 --> 56:25.020
(Amy panting)

56:32.070 --> 56:34.190
- As long as I hold
you, she can't hurt you.

56:34.190 --> 56:37.070
(suspenseful music)

56:37.070 --> 56:42.080
Mom, I saw her at the table.

56:43.190 --> 56:45.080
I saw her when she
was choking you.

56:48.050 --> 56:49.010
- Her?

56:56.110 --> 56:57.140
Is that who you saw?

57:00.160 --> 57:02.170
Baby, it's okay. You can
tell me, is that her?

57:02.170 --> 57:03.130
- No.

57:05.000 --> 57:06.080
- Are you sure, baby?
Please look closer.

57:06.080 --> 57:07.070
It has to be.

57:08.070 --> 57:09.230
- That's not who I saw.

57:09.230 --> 57:11.210
(Amy inhales)

57:11.210 --> 57:13.120
- Then who the fuck did you see?

57:13.120 --> 57:15.230
- I don't know!
- Who did you see, goddammit!

57:15.230 --> 57:17.050
Tell me who the fuck you saw!

57:17.050 --> 57:19.150
(fire roaring)
(wind whistling)

57:19.150 --> 57:21.050
(Amy gasping)
(intense music)

57:21.050 --> 57:25.150
God! (groaning)

57:25.150 --> 57:29.000
(Adrian screams)

57:29.000 --> 57:30.220
(fire crackling)

57:30.220 --> 57:33.220
(suspenseful music)

57:38.200 --> 57:41.220
(package crinkling)

57:45.020 --> 57:46.180
Just a second, baby.

57:48.040 --> 57:52.070
Okay. Give me your
hand, give me your hand.

57:52.070 --> 57:53.140
I'm so sorry.

57:55.220 --> 57:57.170
(Amy breathes uneasily)

57:57.170 --> 58:00.070
(eerie music)

58:06.180 --> 58:09.060
(Amy sobbing)

58:30.160 --> 58:33.160
(suspenseful music)

58:54.020 --> 58:56.140
(door opens)

58:58.010 --> 59:00.070
(indistinct chattering)

59:00.070 --> 59:04.190
(siren wailing in distance)

59:04.190 --> 59:06.100
- See you later, Jenny.

59:06.100 --> 59:11.100
(suspenseful music)
(keys jangling)

59:12.080 --> 59:13.080
(car door closes)

59:13.080 --> 59:16.040
(engine starting)

59:31.070 --> 59:34.070
(crickets chirping)

59:35.190 --> 59:40.120
♪ I first started
looking for you ♪

59:41.110 --> 59:43.090
♪ Make your stand ♪

59:46.030 --> 59:47.170
(horn blaring)
(engine revving)

59:47.170 --> 59:50.190
(suspenseful music)
- What the hell?

59:50.190 --> 59:53.150
(engines revving)

59:59.130 --> 01:00:01.120
(tires screeching)
(cars crashing)

01:00:01.120 --> 01:00:02.190
(horn blaring)

01:00:02.190 --> 01:00:05.110
(intense music)

01:00:14.150 --> 01:00:17.060
(door closes)
(horn honks)

01:00:17.060 --> 01:00:20.040
(door opens)

01:00:20.040 --> 01:00:22.180
(Judith grunting)
(Jenny groans and gasps)

01:00:22.180 --> 01:00:26.060
(intense music continues)

01:00:28.140 --> 01:00:29.180
You're Judith.

01:00:31.220 --> 01:00:34.100
(fist thuds)

01:00:44.200 --> 01:00:46.100
- Hmm. Morning, sunshine.

01:00:47.210 --> 01:00:49.130
I hope it's okay that
I'm smoking in your car.

01:00:49.130 --> 01:00:51.010
I'd have asked, of course, but

01:00:52.120 --> 01:00:53.190
you were sleeping
like a little angel.

01:00:55.060 --> 01:00:57.020
- You gonna tell me
where we're going?

01:00:57.020 --> 01:01:00.020
- Actually, I was hoping
you could help me with that.

01:01:00.020 --> 01:01:01.220
- Oh really?
- Yeah.

01:01:01.220 --> 01:01:05.070
Uh, Amy's parents have that
farmhouse out here. Right?

01:01:05.070 --> 01:01:07.190
I never got to visit, what
with her dad being in prison

01:01:07.190 --> 01:01:11.070
and her mom being dead and
all, plus let's face it,

01:01:11.070 --> 01:01:12.120
I'm not really the kind
of girl you take home

01:01:12.120 --> 01:01:14.020
to your parents, am I?

01:01:14.020 --> 01:01:16.100
(Jenny scoffs)

01:01:16.100 --> 01:01:19.030
So, what has she
told you about me?

01:01:20.010 --> 01:01:22.070
- (sighs) Oh, you know.

01:01:23.180 --> 01:01:27.000
- No, no, I don't
know. Enlighten me.

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:28.120
- Just that you're
batshit crazy.

01:01:28.120 --> 01:01:30.180
- Hmm. Nice.

01:01:30.180 --> 01:01:32.100
- Looks like she was right.

01:01:32.100 --> 01:01:35.190
- Maybe, but you don't
know the half of it.

01:01:35.190 --> 01:01:36.230
- What?

01:01:36.230 --> 01:01:39.050
That you're an abusive bitch

01:01:39.050 --> 01:01:42.030
and Amy just wants a
fresh start with her son?

01:01:42.030 --> 01:01:45.070
- Our son. Let's get that
shit straight right now.

01:01:45.070 --> 01:01:46.220
And where's the fucking farm?

01:01:46.220 --> 01:01:48.220
- Go fuck yourself sideways.

01:01:48.220 --> 01:01:50.180
- Sideways. That's a new one.

01:02:00.230 --> 01:02:04.000
Listen, I gotta tell you,
I am not one for games.

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:07.000
Amy loves that shit, used
to play 'em all the time.

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:08.190
Give me a fucking migraine.

01:02:08.190 --> 01:02:11.030
- (scoffs) Well, there's aspirin
in the glove compartment.

01:02:12.180 --> 01:02:14.030
- Oh cute.

01:02:14.030 --> 01:02:15.230
(blade clicks)
I'm not fucking around.

01:02:17.150 --> 01:02:19.160
- Why can't you just
leave her alone?

01:02:19.160 --> 01:02:21.180
- Because that boy is mine.

01:02:21.180 --> 01:02:24.020
I sacrificed too goddamn
much to leave him now.

01:02:25.090 --> 01:02:28.020
- What did you
sacrifice? Enlighten me.

01:02:31.170 --> 01:02:33.020
- You want one of these?

01:02:33.020 --> 01:02:34.160
- No.

01:02:34.160 --> 01:02:37.130
- Listen, I know you
think you know Amy,

01:02:37.130 --> 01:02:39.190
you grew up with her
in this shithole.

01:02:39.190 --> 01:02:44.000
Let me guess.
Graduating class of 65.

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.090
- 32.
- (chuckles) Wow.

01:02:48.120 --> 01:02:52.070
Just know that whatever
she's told you about me,

01:02:53.180 --> 01:02:56.100
nothing can compare to
the way she is, nothing.

01:02:57.220 --> 01:02:59.130
I'm here to get my
son away from her.

01:03:00.180 --> 01:03:02.200
- I've known Amy my whole life.

01:03:04.060 --> 01:03:05.210
(scoffs) She's nothing like you.

01:03:08.130 --> 01:03:09.220
- She ever tell you what
happened to her

01:03:10.020 --> 01:03:10.200
mother that night?

01:03:13.020 --> 01:03:15.000
Yeah, that's what I thought.

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.210
I'm guessing she told you
that same bullshit story,

01:03:17.210 --> 01:03:20.180
all about how she woke
up and caught her father

01:03:20.180 --> 01:03:23.000
taking a knife to her
mother while she slept.

01:03:24.190 --> 01:03:26.150
- You're lying.
- Am I?

01:03:28.140 --> 01:03:31.050
Because I'd be willing to
bet what little money I have,

01:03:31.050 --> 01:03:33.200
deep down, you've
known all along.

01:03:35.150 --> 01:03:37.200
I mean, come on. You saw
how Amy's mom treated her.

01:03:37.200 --> 01:03:39.150
No fucking surprise
she finally snapped

01:03:39.150 --> 01:03:41.030
and murdered that bitch.

01:03:41.030 --> 01:03:43.170
(eerie music)

01:03:53.180 --> 01:03:57.020
Now just imagine
what she was like

01:03:57.020 --> 01:03:58.200
when she wanted a
child of her own.

01:04:00.080 --> 01:04:03.120
There I was, ready to do
anything to please her.

01:04:06.210 --> 01:04:10.200
Even when shit went too far.

01:04:10.200 --> 01:04:14.040
(eerie music continues)

01:04:39.080 --> 01:04:41.170
(Amy crying)

01:04:49.090 --> 01:04:51.230
(Amy sobbing)

01:05:02.030 --> 01:05:05.190
Oh, it's been a while
since that's happened.

01:05:07.230 --> 01:05:10.070
So now you know, I won't
hesitate to kill you

01:05:10.070 --> 01:05:13.000
and dump your body in
that ditch over there.

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:14.130
And don't think for a
second that doesn't apply

01:05:14.130 --> 01:05:16.190
to your little waitress
buddies at the diner.

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:19.010
Do you understand me?

01:05:22.020 --> 01:05:25.130
Hmm? Now you're gonna
take me where I wanna go.

01:05:27.190 --> 01:05:28.150
Okay?

01:05:31.120 --> 01:05:32.080
- Okay.

01:05:34.160 --> 01:05:36.200
(shift clicks)

01:05:36.200 --> 01:05:39.160
(engine revving)

01:05:58.090 --> 01:05:59.190
- You feeling better, baby?

01:06:08.020 --> 01:06:11.030
- Mom, do you think
it's safe to go?

01:06:16.120 --> 01:06:17.080
Mom?

01:06:35.010 --> 01:06:36.130
- Stay behind me. Okay?

01:06:41.020 --> 01:06:44.040
(suspenseful music)

01:06:56.010 --> 01:06:57.230
Just stay close, buddy.

01:07:02.010 --> 01:07:04.010
(intense music)

01:07:04.010 --> 01:07:07.000
(wind howling)

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.100
(door slams)
(Amy gasping)

01:07:09.100 --> 01:07:13.050
(Amy choking and coughing)

01:07:13.050 --> 01:07:15.220
- Let me out! Let
me out of here!

01:07:15.220 --> 01:07:18.060
(The Woman snarling)
Let me out!

01:07:18.060 --> 01:07:19.170
Let me out!

01:07:19.170 --> 01:07:21.090
Let me out of here!
(Amy gasping)

01:07:21.090 --> 01:07:24.010
Let me out! Let me out!

01:07:24.010 --> 01:07:25.210
(The Woman snarling)

01:07:25.210 --> 01:07:26.170
Oh God!

01:07:33.210 --> 01:07:35.110
No.

01:07:35.110 --> 01:07:36.110
- Tell him!

01:07:38.200 --> 01:07:41.060
- Okay, okay. I'll tell him!

01:07:42.130 --> 01:07:43.160
I'll tell him.

01:07:43.160 --> 01:07:46.110
(wind whistling)

01:07:47.210 --> 01:07:52.090
- Tell me what?
(The Woman snarling)

01:07:52.090 --> 01:07:54.210
(Amy gasping)

01:08:00.100 --> 01:08:03.040
(rain pattering)

01:08:04.080 --> 01:08:07.050
(car approaching)

01:08:14.040 --> 01:08:16.020
- Just do exactly
what I tell you

01:08:16.020 --> 01:08:18.110
and you can get outta here
without a scratch on you.

01:08:18.110 --> 01:08:20.170
- She'll never come to the
door if you're with me.

01:08:20.170 --> 01:08:23.100
(rain pattering)

01:08:23.100 --> 01:08:28.110
(soft dramatic music)
(Amy breathes uneasily)

01:08:35.180 --> 01:08:37.180
- I am so sorry, Adrian.

01:08:43.200 --> 01:08:48.070
You know I love you more
than anything, right, baby?

01:08:48.070 --> 01:08:49.030
- I know.

01:08:54.020 --> 01:08:56.220
(Amy whimpering)

01:09:01.060 --> 01:09:05.130
- I saw you from
across the street.

01:09:08.080 --> 01:09:10.090
Not far from where we lived.

01:09:10.090 --> 01:09:14.090
(soft dramatic music continues)

01:09:29.230 --> 01:09:34.230
(cries) I knew then
that I had to have you,

01:09:36.010 --> 01:09:37.200
'cause you were so beautiful,

01:09:42.060 --> 01:09:44.200
but I knew she wouldn't
let me have you willingly.

01:09:44.200 --> 01:09:48.200
(soft dramatic music continues)

01:09:52.200 --> 01:09:56.210
(The Woman gasping and groaning)

01:10:11.230 --> 01:10:12.230
Do it, baby.

01:10:15.150 --> 01:10:16.230
- Right.
- For me.

01:10:16.230 --> 01:10:19.110
(eerie music)

01:10:20.090 --> 01:10:22.230
(blade clicks)

01:10:24.050 --> 01:10:27.010
(The Woman gasps)

01:10:33.020 --> 01:10:33.220
Do it!

01:10:33.220 --> 01:10:36.140
(intense music)

01:10:37.180 --> 01:10:40.120
(blood spurting)

01:10:42.170 --> 01:10:44.210
(Baby Adrian crying)

01:10:44.210 --> 01:10:48.090
(intense music continues)

01:11:05.090 --> 01:11:06.210
(Amy crying)

01:11:06.210 --> 01:11:09.000
(soft dramatic music)

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:09.200
Adrian...

01:11:15.040 --> 01:11:20.040
Judith and I didn't
adopt you. (sobbing)

01:11:22.230 --> 01:11:24.210
We stole you from her.

01:11:29.130 --> 01:11:33.200
(cries) We killed her and
then we stole you from her.

01:11:35.230 --> 01:11:38.220
(Adrian crying)

01:11:38.220 --> 01:11:42.060
(sobbing) I'm so sorry.

01:11:43.180 --> 01:11:47.170
(soft dramatic music continues)

01:11:58.060 --> 01:12:01.040
(knocking on door)

01:12:06.230 --> 01:12:09.040
(knocking)

01:12:22.010 --> 01:12:24.070
(knocking)

01:12:39.150 --> 01:12:41.210
(knocking)

01:12:45.150 --> 01:12:48.090
(rain pattering)

01:12:57.020 --> 01:12:59.080
(knocking)

01:13:08.200 --> 01:13:11.020
(knocking)

01:13:12.010 --> 01:13:15.010
(rain pattering)

01:13:15.010 --> 01:13:17.000
- Hey.
- Hi.

01:13:19.050 --> 01:13:20.020
- You all right?

01:13:22.230 --> 01:13:23.190
What's wrong?

01:13:25.120 --> 01:13:27.160
- I can't talk
about it out here.

01:13:27.160 --> 01:13:28.140
Can I come inside?

01:13:32.090 --> 01:13:34.050
- I don't think
that's a good idea.

01:13:36.050 --> 01:13:39.150
- Please. It'll
only take a minute.

01:13:42.080 --> 01:13:45.220
- I'm so sorry, I can't.

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:50.090
- What's going on with you?

01:13:54.160 --> 01:13:55.190
- Please leave, Jenny.

01:14:04.030 --> 01:14:05.020
- I can't leave.

01:14:08.030 --> 01:14:09.030
She's here.

Are you okay?

01:14:48.060 --> 01:14:49.180

01:15:39.110 --> 01:15:40.070
Drop it.

Get on your knees.

01:16:02.060 --> 01:16:05.180
- (scoffs) Planning on
shooting me execution-style?

01:16:08.030 --> 01:16:09.110
- I've got a guest here,

01:16:10.210 --> 01:16:12.080
and I'm sure would
love to see you again.

01:16:13.180 --> 01:16:15.060

- Yeah.

01:16:16.170 --> 01:16:18.210
Think of it like
a family reunion.

01:16:18.210 --> 01:16:20.180
- What the fuck are
you talking about?

01:16:21.150 --> 01:16:22.110
- You'll see.

01:16:24.070 --> 01:16:26.160
She's had loads of fun with
me, but now it's your turn.

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:30.170
So why don't you come out?

I've got an old
friend here for you.

01:16:34.200 --> 01:16:37.060

crazier than I remember.

01:16:37.060 --> 01:16:38.170

special! Come out!

01:18:11.090 --> 01:18:12.100
Looks like I win.

01:18:13.180 --> 01:18:15.090
I'm gonna let you die real slow.

01:18:16.020 --> 01:18:18.140
And then I'm gonna come
after your little girlfriend.

01:18:18.140 --> 01:18:22.190

away from her? (gasping)

01:18:27.030 --> 01:18:29.170
(Amy coughing)

01:18:31.180 --> 01:18:32.140
I'm sorry.

01:18:34.120 --> 01:18:36.040
- For what?

01:18:36.040 --> 01:18:38.160
For turning me into
a killer like you?

01:18:38.160 --> 01:18:42.110
(Amy coughs and gasps)

01:18:42.110 --> 01:18:46.060
