00:01.502 --> 00:04.838
<i>It seems today that all you see</i>

00:04.922 --> 00:08.133
<i>Is violence in movies and sex on TV</i>

00:08.217 --> 00:11.637
<i>But where are those</i>
<i>good old-fashioned values</i>

00:11.720 --> 00:14.932
<i>On which we used to rely?</i>

00:15.015 --> 00:18.185
<i>Lucky there's a family guy</i>

00:18.268 --> 00:21.438
<i>Lucky there's a man who</i>
<i>positively can do</i>

00:21.522 --> 00:23.106
<i>All the things that make us</i>

00:23.190 --> 00:24.858
<i>Laugh and cry</i>

00:24.942 --> 00:29.947
<i>He's a family guy</i>

00:35.160 --> 00:36.620
Hi, it's me, Peter.

00:36.703 --> 00:39.039
You may be wondering what I'm doing
in a library.

00:39.122 --> 00:41.834
Well, I actually drove my car
into this rich guy's house

00:41.917 --> 00:44.169
and he locked me in here
until the police come.

00:44.253 --> 00:45.546
Don't believe me?

00:45.629 --> 00:47.506
I don't know, I just locked him
in the library.

00:47.589 --> 00:48.966
Seems like he's on something.

00:49.049 --> 00:51.552
He's got crazy eyes and keeps screaming,
"I don't care."

00:51.635 --> 00:53.053
I don't care!

00:53.136 --> 00:54.638
Anyway, I've got some time to kill

00:54.721 --> 00:56.348
before this room is filled with tear gas.

00:56.431 --> 00:58.350
So, I thought why not finally read

00:58.433 --> 01:00.727
some of the classics I never read
in high school?

01:00.811 --> 01:03.230
Here's one right here, <i>The Great Gatsby.</i>

01:03.313 --> 01:06.525
A book by the only respected guy
in the world named Scott.

01:20.080 --> 01:22.583
<i>It was my first summer staying</i>
<i>at the shore.</i>

01:22.666 --> 01:26.170
<i>But I had a feeling that, I,</i>
<i>Nick "The Situation" Carraway,</i>

01:26.253 --> 01:27.379
<i>would fit right in.</i>

01:30.674 --> 01:32.593
Hey, it's Nick from <i>The Great Gatsby.</i>

01:32.676 --> 01:35.345
I just checked in and somebody left
their teeth here.

01:36.054 --> 01:38.015
I don't know, it's just a set of teeth.

01:38.807 --> 01:40.142
I guess men's.

01:40.934 --> 01:43.187
No, I'm not putting them anywhere,
you come and get them.

01:45.189 --> 01:48.275
The neighbors are having a party
with loud jazz music.

01:48.817 --> 01:52.362
Well, at least annoyingly scatting
over jazz hasn't been invented yet.

01:57.034 --> 01:58.952
Oh, that must've been invented today!

02:12.633 --> 02:13.926
Hey, whose party is this?

02:14.009 --> 02:16.637
I'm not sure, women aren't allowed
to ask questions yet.

02:16.720 --> 02:17.971
So, what's your name?

02:18.055 --> 02:19.431
Madam, you forget yourself.

02:24.436 --> 02:27.940
<i>That's when I first laid eyes</i>
<i>on him, Jay Gatsby.</i>

02:28.023 --> 02:29.983
<i>He was clearly playing with himself</i>
<i>through his pocket,</i>

02:30.067 --> 02:31.527
<i>but I pretended not to see.</i>

02:31.610 --> 02:33.946
Hello, welcome to my party. Name's Gatsby.

02:34.029 --> 02:35.155
Good to meet you, old sport.

02:35.239 --> 02:36.365
Yeah, just a wave is fine.

02:36.448 --> 02:38.283
I'm your new neighbor, Nick Carraway.

02:38.367 --> 02:40.661
Oh, I hope we weren't too loud, old sport.

02:40.744 --> 02:43.914
Yeah, this "old sport" thing,
is this something you're trying out,

02:43.997 --> 02:44.998
or is this a keeper?

02:45.082 --> 02:47.709
I just met you, so I wanna
tell you something very private.

02:47.793 --> 02:49.002
Let's go out to the dock.

02:53.215 --> 02:56.760
I come down here to think every night
and gaze at that green light.

02:56.844 --> 02:58.846
It's where the love of my life lives.

02:58.929 --> 03:00.055
Daisy Buchanan.

03:02.599 --> 03:05.352
Um, I hate to break it you,
but that light you've been looking at,

03:05.435 --> 03:07.312
is a gay gym called The Pump House.

03:07.396 --> 03:11.650
I only know that because I saw a coupon
that came with my rental. Um...

03:11.733 --> 03:14.653
Anyway, Daisy's house is over there.
She's my cousin.

03:14.736 --> 03:15.863
Daisy's your cousin?

03:15.946 --> 03:19.241
Yeah, lot of weird coincidences
for an American classic, huh?

03:19.324 --> 03:20.784
What? I have to see her.

03:20.868 --> 03:23.745
Well, I can set that up.
Only thing is, she's married.

03:23.829 --> 03:26.164
Yeah, and I hear her husband's
a real heel.

03:26.248 --> 03:28.125
Whoa! Language!

03:28.208 --> 03:29.501
But, yeah, I'll set it up.

03:29.585 --> 03:31.587
Tea, tomorrow at my house, 2:00 p.m.

03:31.670 --> 03:32.880
Great.

03:32.963 --> 03:34.882
She's gonna be there, right?

03:34.965 --> 03:36.300
Yeah, why wouldn't she be there?

03:36.383 --> 03:38.510
I don't know.
I'm just getting a funny vibe from you.

03:38.594 --> 03:40.637
You asked me down to the docks alone

03:40.721 --> 03:42.890
and <i>you're</i> getting a funny vibe from <i>me?</i>

03:48.103 --> 03:50.314
Wow, what an ugly little house.

03:50.397 --> 03:53.317
Oh, yeah, it's not that palace
of domestic abuse you live in.

03:53.984 --> 03:55.861
What's up?

03:55.944 --> 03:58.488
Oh, my God! Is it really you?

03:58.572 --> 04:00.407
I've missed you, Daisy.

04:00.490 --> 04:01.992
You're as beautiful as ever.

04:02.075 --> 04:04.411
You know what else is beautiful?
My bank account.

04:04.494 --> 04:05.913
Boom! Rich guy.

04:05.996 --> 04:08.332
You're rich now? Oh, my God, I love that.

04:08.415 --> 04:10.501
I know, right?
Come on, I'll show you my place.

04:11.084 --> 04:14.296
Oh, you're leaving?
But I made all these deviled eggs.

04:14.379 --> 04:16.423
- You made?
- You know what I meant.

04:16.507 --> 04:18.759
Yeah, you made them. Great job.

04:29.520 --> 04:31.897
You know, one of the best parts about
having an enormous mansion

04:31.980 --> 04:34.399
is being able to come out here
and get some fresh air.

04:34.483 --> 04:36.777
You know, sometimes,
I just want to jump off this balcony

04:36.860 --> 04:38.362
and into that pool down there.

04:40.489 --> 04:42.950
- So, do it.
- Yeah, I know, right? Do it.

04:43.033 --> 04:44.201
Yeah, do it.

04:44.284 --> 04:46.119
I know, I totally should, right?
Here I go.

04:46.203 --> 04:48.372
One, two, three... Whoa!

04:48.455 --> 04:49.623
Can you imagine?

04:49.706 --> 04:52.459
Yeah, I can imagine.
It would be fun, you should do it.

04:52.543 --> 04:54.169
If only it were that easy, right?

04:54.253 --> 04:57.464
It is, it looks deep enough,
it's your pool, it's your house,

04:57.548 --> 04:58.715
you can do whatever you want.

04:58.799 --> 04:59.842
I know, right?

04:59.925 --> 05:01.093
You know what?
I can't right now,

05:01.176 --> 05:02.302
my pool guy's cleaning it.

05:02.886 --> 05:05.013
Are you going to bone her?

05:11.103 --> 05:12.563
This is amazing.

05:12.646 --> 05:14.648
I've never seen so many shirts.

05:14.731 --> 05:17.025
Do you have enough to, you know, throw?

05:17.109 --> 05:18.777
Yeah, you know, they're actually
kind of expensive.

05:18.861 --> 05:20.070
Oh, there she goes.

05:20.904 --> 05:24.908
Shirt, shirt, shirt...

05:25.409 --> 05:27.953
Okay, five is good, five is probably good.

05:28.036 --> 05:29.538
Shirt, shirt.

05:29.621 --> 05:33.125
Were you this crazy
when we dated before?

05:39.047 --> 05:40.549
Hmm. Gatsby, is it?

05:40.632 --> 05:43.177
I've been hearing about your vast,
newly acquired wealth

05:43.260 --> 05:45.179
and your attentions to my wife.

05:45.262 --> 05:48.515
So, I thought I would have you over to
my equally large and fancy

05:48.599 --> 05:51.935
but imperceptibly more classy mansion
for an awkward dinner.

05:52.019 --> 05:53.854
And, Nick, have you met Jordan?

05:53.937 --> 05:57.941
She plays golf and is what kids
will someday call a duff.

05:58.025 --> 06:00.277
Hey, yeah, nice tam o'shanter.

06:00.360 --> 06:02.404
I'll drink your finger bowl,
if you don't want it.

06:02.487 --> 06:05.449
<i>In the book, I actually go</i>
<i>on a few dates with Jordan.</i>

06:05.532 --> 06:06.950
<i>We're gonna skip all that.</i>

06:07.034 --> 06:09.161
Anyway, like I was saying, you're a trash

06:09.244 --> 06:11.914
'cause you earned your money
a little bit more recently than me.

06:11.997 --> 06:13.081
What are you getting at?

06:13.165 --> 06:16.084
I'm saying I invited you over
and sat you next to my wife

06:16.168 --> 06:18.253
to say, "Stay away from my wife."

06:18.337 --> 06:19.338
You know what we should do?

06:19.421 --> 06:22.007
Let's all drunk drive into Manhattan
and get a hotel room

06:22.090 --> 06:23.967
and have the same conversation
we're having here.

06:24.051 --> 06:25.802
I'm starting to think this isn't a very
good book.

06:29.181 --> 06:31.225
I'd like to add another bit of
pointless confusion

06:31.308 --> 06:32.684
that will make sense later,

06:32.768 --> 06:34.686
let's everyone drive somebody else's car.

06:34.770 --> 06:35.812
Someone can take my Coupe.

06:35.896 --> 06:37.189
I'm riding with Gatsby,
I don't care which car.

06:37.272 --> 06:38.482
I'll take someone in Daisy's car.

06:38.565 --> 06:40.108
I don't think Daisy said
you could drive her car.

06:40.192 --> 06:41.652
Tom, why don't you take Jay's car?

06:41.735 --> 06:43.195
- Who's Jay?
- Gatsby.

06:43.278 --> 06:45.656
Okay, I've never heard anyone
call him that.

06:45.739 --> 06:47.783
Look, if you're in your own car,
you're in the wrong car.

06:56.750 --> 06:57.751
All right, you guys get gas.

06:57.835 --> 06:59.419
I got to talk to this random mechanic's

06:59.503 --> 07:01.171
horny wife about some business.

07:01.255 --> 07:03.090
Wilson, gonna need to fill her up.

07:03.173 --> 07:05.133
Wilson's wife, fill her up. Get it?

07:12.724 --> 07:14.268
I don't know what they do up there,

07:14.351 --> 07:16.854
but they sure do listen
to Def Leppard pretty loud.

07:20.524 --> 07:22.818
So, have you seen any good movies lately?

07:22.901 --> 07:25.821
We just saw
<i>Woman Tied to Railroad Tracks 5.</i>

07:25.904 --> 07:27.114
Pretty similar to 4.

07:27.197 --> 07:28.532
Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm.

07:29.741 --> 07:32.953
Well, looks like you guys are getting
a head start on the depression here.

07:35.956 --> 07:38.000
Thanks for stopping by, Mr. Buchanan.

07:38.083 --> 07:40.169
Yeah, sure.
Don't tell anyone how bad I look naked.

07:40.252 --> 07:42.045
Have fun raising my bastard.

07:43.255 --> 07:44.381
All right, let's head out.

07:44.464 --> 07:45.465
Wait, but first.

07:45.549 --> 07:47.050
I wanna see if we're in the funny
horn era.

07:48.343 --> 07:49.636
Aha! We are!

07:54.516 --> 07:56.643
All right, Gatsby, you think
you're so hot?

07:56.727 --> 07:59.771
Let me show you how a classy guy
does classy stuff.

08:00.230 --> 08:01.231
Hello, room service?

08:01.315 --> 08:04.067
I'd like a bottle of your
second most expensive champagne.

08:04.693 --> 08:07.487
And I'd like your most expensive bottle.

08:07.988 --> 08:09.573
Wow, walked right into that one.

08:09.656 --> 08:12.034
Okay, fine.
Let's see who has higher socks.

08:13.702 --> 08:15.579
Whatever, Tom, none of that matters.

08:15.662 --> 08:16.914
Daisy's in love with me.

08:16.997 --> 08:19.166
In fact, she's never loved you.

08:19.249 --> 08:20.542
Oh, is that so?

08:20.626 --> 08:24.171
Well, I hear Gatsby didn't even fight
in World War I.

08:24.254 --> 08:27.174
Wait, why is he calling it that?
Is there gonna be another big war?

08:29.051 --> 08:30.344
I'm sorry, Tom.

08:30.427 --> 08:34.097
That's right. I'm in love with Daisy,
and she loves me, old sport.

08:36.475 --> 08:39.770
Would anyone like a deviled egg
from a tea I had several days ago?

08:44.191 --> 08:45.609
Well, that was awful.

08:45.692 --> 08:49.530
But I sure do enjoy driving your car,
instead of you driving it,

08:49.613 --> 08:51.573
even though we came in a different car.

08:51.657 --> 08:54.993
Drunk, don't forget, drunk.
You're drunk driving my car.

08:57.621 --> 09:00.666
Gas and sandwiches,
get your gas and sandwiches.

09:04.002 --> 09:07.506
That must be Tom since I saw him
in that car earlier.

09:09.508 --> 09:11.218
Tom, Tom, it's me.

09:14.805 --> 09:17.850
Oh, no, Myrtle.

09:17.933 --> 09:22.104
Where will I ever find another woman
with a hotter name than Myrtle?

09:26.984 --> 09:29.152
All right, pool, do your thing.

09:29.236 --> 09:30.237
You hungover?

09:30.320 --> 09:31.822
Uh, a little bit, yeah.

09:32.489 --> 09:35.075
Okay, we're sort of racing
to the end here,

09:35.158 --> 09:39.413
and with that,
I shall step slightly out of range.

09:39.496 --> 09:41.498
All right, I'm just gonna take
a quick swim.

09:43.375 --> 09:44.751
Oh, my God, where are the stairs?

09:44.835 --> 09:46.795
There's no stairs,
I'm never gonna make it.

09:49.173 --> 09:53.010
You were standing earlier in the day
next to the car that hit my wife.

10:00.350 --> 10:03.228
<i>I would soon return to New York</i>
<i>a changed man.</i>

10:03.312 --> 10:05.814
<i>Because for me,</i>
<i>that will always be the summer</i>

10:05.898 --> 10:08.400
<i>that I finally put my head under water.</i>

10:08.483 --> 10:10.611
I did it, I did it.

10:10.694 --> 10:12.529
I wish somebody had seen that.

10:19.912 --> 10:21.121
Hi, me again.

10:21.205 --> 10:23.040
I'm not in that guy's library anymore.

10:23.123 --> 10:25.626
I snuck up to the attic just before
the cops busted in.

10:25.709 --> 10:27.211
They're down there now, look.

10:30.088 --> 10:31.840
Only problem is, I really want to get to

10:31.924 --> 10:33.759
that trunk of costumes in the corner.

10:34.510 --> 10:37.137
On the one hand,
I don't want to give away my location.

10:37.221 --> 10:39.598
On the other hand,
there might be a pirate hat.

10:43.393 --> 10:45.437
Hmm, no pirate hat, but I'll make it work.

10:45.521 --> 10:50.108
Ar! I'm a chef aboard a pirate ship.
Now, who be wanting pancakes?

10:50.192 --> 10:51.735
<i>I think I hear</i>
<i>something in the attic.</i>

10:51.818 --> 10:52.819
Oh, crap.

10:52.903 --> 10:55.239
While I figure out my options,
here's <i>Huckleberry Finn.</i>

11:04.498 --> 11:06.667
Hi, Huckleberry Finn.

11:06.750 --> 11:08.168
Hi, Tom Sawyer.

11:08.252 --> 11:09.753
You're Tom, I'm Huck.

11:10.170 --> 11:12.506
Everybody good? Yup?
All right, let's do this.

11:12.589 --> 11:15.300
Huckleberry Finn, you get inside
this house this minute.

11:15.384 --> 11:17.594
It's Tuesday morning,
it's time for church.

11:17.678 --> 11:21.223
Oh, Widow Douglas, I already been
to church three times today.

11:21.306 --> 11:23.350
I want to stay home and play <i>Angry Birds.</i>

11:28.564 --> 11:30.482
This is addictive.

11:30.566 --> 11:32.484
Hey, I'm your abusive dad

11:32.568 --> 11:35.153
and I've been drinking all day
from this here jug.

11:35.237 --> 11:37.531
Oh, my God, is that a jug full of porn?

11:37.614 --> 11:39.366
Hey, Widow Douglas,
I wanna live with my dad.

11:39.449 --> 11:40.492
Shut your hole.

11:40.576 --> 11:42.202
Now, come on, I need to use your pee.

11:42.286 --> 11:44.121
I'm taking a wagon test in the morning.

11:47.833 --> 11:49.585
I wish you wouldn't drink so much.

11:49.668 --> 11:51.003
Stop counting my drinks.

11:51.086 --> 11:52.754
Now, get over here so I can whip you.

11:54.298 --> 11:56.550
Ow! Dad, no.

11:56.633 --> 11:58.385
Yeah, that's right, bitch.

11:58.468 --> 11:59.636
Now, it's your turn.

12:01.221 --> 12:03.640
Gee, this is worse than
the Widow Douglas' house.

12:03.724 --> 12:04.725
I got to get out of here.

12:07.311 --> 12:09.646
I know, I'll fake my own death.

12:09.730 --> 12:11.899
I just need enough blood
to make it look real.

12:11.982 --> 12:14.484
Hey, there, you must be Huck.
Great to finally meet you.

12:14.568 --> 12:15.611
I hope you like it here.

12:15.694 --> 12:17.279
I'm gonna stab you for your blood.

12:17.362 --> 12:20.115
Oh, come on, I just got shot
in the pool in the last...

12:26.163 --> 12:27.831
I can't remember why I needed the blood.

12:35.923 --> 12:37.549
Lord, I'm gonna tell you.

12:37.633 --> 12:41.762
Being a slave is a much worse job
than the temp agency made it sound.

12:41.845 --> 12:43.055
You gonna eat all that possum?

12:43.138 --> 12:46.391
I am. My name is Huck Finn.
What's half of your name?

12:46.475 --> 12:49.561
Jim. Nice to meet you.
I'm a runaway slave.

12:49.645 --> 12:52.940
I'm running away 'cause people want me
to wear shoes and comb my hair.

12:53.023 --> 12:54.942
So, I guess we got the exact same problem.

12:59.696 --> 13:01.031
Hey, what's that sound?

13:01.114 --> 13:03.200
Oh, no, it sounds like...

13:03.909 --> 13:05.744
A waterfall!

13:06.537 --> 13:07.829
Hold on!

13:17.297 --> 13:18.465
We died.

13:21.009 --> 13:22.219
So, wait, we didn't die?

13:22.302 --> 13:23.762
I don't know, it's all just jokes.

13:31.228 --> 13:32.855
- Oh! Did you see that?
- What?

13:32.938 --> 13:36.525
I just skipped that rock six times.
That's a once-in-a-lifetime skip.

13:36.608 --> 13:37.609
That's nice.

13:37.693 --> 13:38.694
You don't believe me, do you?

13:38.777 --> 13:41.238
I believe we've been out here a long time,

13:41.321 --> 13:43.824
and a man's mind begins
to play tricks on him.

13:43.907 --> 13:46.243
It happened for real,
I can't believe you didn't see it!

13:47.494 --> 13:48.829
<i>Of course, I saw it.</i>

13:48.912 --> 13:51.832
<i>Most amazing damn thing</i>
<i>I ever did witness.</i>

13:51.915 --> 13:53.500
<i>But I wasn't gonna tell Huck,</i>

13:53.584 --> 13:56.420
<i>'cause he claimed he didn't see me</i>
<i>hook shot that apple core</i>

13:56.503 --> 13:58.839
<i>into the garbage from way far away.</i>

13:59.965 --> 14:01.175
Hello, friends.

14:01.258 --> 14:03.343
Why are you so friendly? You con man?

14:03.427 --> 14:06.680
No, we're business men.
We're fake selling the Brooklyn Bridge.

14:06.763 --> 14:07.931
Don't say, "Fake Selling."

14:08.015 --> 14:10.350
We're real selling the Brooklyn Bridge.

14:10.434 --> 14:13.020
Stop qualifying the selling,
we're just selling the Brooklyn Bridge.

14:13.103 --> 14:15.022
- I'll buy it.
- Hold on, now, Huck.

14:15.105 --> 14:17.107
These fellows are con men.

14:17.191 --> 14:18.525
Push off, you grifters.

14:18.609 --> 14:20.527
We don't want to ever see you again.

14:20.611 --> 14:21.612
Fine, we're going.

14:25.991 --> 14:28.368
It's a river,
we can't control how fast it goes,

14:28.452 --> 14:29.786
we can barely steer.

14:34.041 --> 14:35.042
Sorry.

14:40.005 --> 14:43.091
Hey, what if it's spelled with an "A"
at the end of it? Is that okay?

14:43.175 --> 14:44.801
Jim?

14:48.347 --> 14:50.224
Jim.

14:50.307 --> 14:53.393
If you're looking for a gym,
ye old Pump House is that way.

14:53.477 --> 14:55.354
Can't miss it. Green light on the dock.

14:57.314 --> 15:00.108
Tom Sawyer.
What are you doing so far from home?

15:00.192 --> 15:03.695
Rush is playing here tonight.
They wrote a song about me.

15:03.779 --> 15:06.281
Oh. Well, I'm looking for my friend, Jim.

15:06.365 --> 15:08.492
Huck, great news, I'm free.

15:08.575 --> 15:10.744
You are?
That's awesome, when did that happen?

15:10.827 --> 15:14.581
It's just being revealed now but it
happened hundreds of pages ago.

15:14.665 --> 15:16.667
Oh, wow. Weird.

15:16.750 --> 15:18.502
So, uh, what's left to do?

15:18.585 --> 15:21.088
I'll tell you what. Rush concert.

15:26.927 --> 15:29.596
<i>A modern day warrior</i>
<i>Mean, mean stride</i>

15:29.680 --> 15:32.432
<i>Today's Tom Sawyer</i>
<i>Mean, mean pride...</i>

15:33.267 --> 15:35.310
Hey, I'm Mark Twain.

15:35.394 --> 15:36.854
Pretty cool book, huh?

15:41.024 --> 15:43.443
Well, while I'm being booked
and processed downtown,

15:43.527 --> 15:46.488
we have time for one more classic
of American literature.

15:46.572 --> 15:48.949
This one's about idiots choking rodents.

15:49.032 --> 15:51.034
I give you <i>Of Mice and Men.</i>

15:51.118 --> 15:52.160
Read him his rights.

15:52.244 --> 15:54.538
You know what?
I'd like to read them myself.

15:55.372 --> 15:57.624
Chapter one, Eat My Ass, Pigs.

15:57.708 --> 15:59.877
The bones in my nose!

16:08.468 --> 16:12.973
Wow, I remember when this used to be
all orange groves.

16:13.056 --> 16:15.475
It's currently all orange groves.

16:19.771 --> 16:22.232
Tell me again about our dream, George.

16:22.316 --> 16:23.483
All right, all right.

16:23.567 --> 16:26.111
We're going to open a bed and breakfast
in the country.

16:26.195 --> 16:28.280
And we won't be afraid
to let our guests know

16:28.363 --> 16:30.782
that we are Steelers fans in this house.

16:30.866 --> 16:32.284
What about the rabbits?

16:32.367 --> 16:33.452
Yeah, we'll have rabbits, too.

16:33.535 --> 16:35.787
But we'll also have a sign
in the front that says,

16:35.871 --> 16:37.998
"Steelers fan parking only."

16:38.081 --> 16:40.709
And sometimes we'll give our guests
a fake hard time.

16:40.792 --> 16:42.669
Like if they're Jets fans,
we'll be all like,

16:42.753 --> 16:44.713
"Okay, I hope you don't get towed."

16:44.796 --> 16:47.257
But, obviously, you know, of course,
we're not gonna tow them.

16:57.809 --> 17:00.312
Hey there, strangers,
welcome to Phelps Ranch.

17:00.395 --> 17:01.647
People call me Slim.

17:01.730 --> 17:03.023
Ironically, I assume.

17:03.106 --> 17:06.068
Listen, we're looking for field work,
if you need any extra hands.

17:06.151 --> 17:08.362
Well, three of our guys
did just get squished,

17:08.445 --> 17:09.947
so we just might. Come on in.

17:12.157 --> 17:13.909
So, have you done this kind
of work before?

17:13.992 --> 17:17.704
Have we pulled an object off a plant
and placed it in a burlap bag?

17:17.788 --> 17:20.707
Yes, I think we understand
the nuances of this profession.

17:20.791 --> 17:23.126
Good, good. And how about you?
Tell me about yourself.

17:23.210 --> 17:26.171
I like to kill animals and then a lady.

17:27.089 --> 17:28.882
I got a good feeling about you guys.

17:33.428 --> 17:35.055
All right, you guys are doing great.

17:35.138 --> 17:37.516
Hey, listen, my dog just had puppies,
and I thought,

17:37.599 --> 17:39.852
since you're covered with feces
and I barely know you,

17:39.935 --> 17:43.063
I'd give you a delicate snow white
newborn puppy.

17:43.146 --> 17:44.898
Okay, just don't give me to dead eyes
over there,

17:44.982 --> 17:47.359
'cause I've already been killed twice
in the other two stories

17:47.442 --> 17:48.569
- and I don't want to...
- Puppy!

17:48.652 --> 17:49.653
Oh, fuck!

17:52.489 --> 17:54.241
This puppy doesn't work.

17:56.285 --> 17:58.537
Well, well, well.

17:58.620 --> 18:01.290
As you can tell by the,
"Well, well, well," he's the bad guy.

18:01.373 --> 18:03.750
Looks like we got us some new employees.

18:03.834 --> 18:05.669
That's right, Curley,
I hired them this morning.

18:05.752 --> 18:06.879
Well, tell them to get out.

18:06.962 --> 18:09.339
This is where I practice my karate
'cause I'm a dick.

18:10.048 --> 18:11.800
I understand you like to pick fruit.

18:11.884 --> 18:14.595
You ever pick something bruised
and pear shaped?

18:14.678 --> 18:16.972
Fruit has seeds you can pull out.

18:17.055 --> 18:19.600
Hey, Hodor,
stop coming on to my slutty wife.

18:19.683 --> 18:21.602
Look, I can tell by the fact that you wear

18:21.685 --> 18:24.980
a single Vaseline-filled leather glove
that you're a reasonable man.

18:25.063 --> 18:27.399
So, let's all take a deep breath
and calm down.

18:27.482 --> 18:28.859
No, karate chop.

18:32.696 --> 18:33.989
Damn it!

18:34.072 --> 18:36.283
I tuck my jeans into my boots.

18:36.366 --> 18:38.869
I'll get you, you stupid giant moron.

18:41.079 --> 18:42.623
Not great timing, I know,

18:42.706 --> 18:44.875
but can I leave early for
a dentist appointment?

18:49.379 --> 18:50.923
So, I should be home by 10:00.

18:51.006 --> 18:54.218
It's just this piano bar/cabaret place
called Tinkles.

18:54.301 --> 18:55.469
Rory told me about it.

18:55.552 --> 18:56.762
Who's Rory?

18:56.845 --> 18:57.888
You remember him,

18:57.971 --> 19:00.390
the field hand who gave me
a shoulder ride back to the house,

19:00.474 --> 19:01.767
that was Rory.

19:01.850 --> 19:03.560
Anyway, it sounds like it's just a hoot.

19:03.644 --> 19:07.773
Wow, maybe you'll meet a pretty lady
to get married to there.

19:07.856 --> 19:10.025
Yeah, well, that's the idea.

19:10.108 --> 19:12.444
While you're gone, can I touch myself?

19:12.528 --> 19:14.863
Again, you don't have to
schedule that with me.

19:14.947 --> 19:16.657
But, remember, if there's any trouble,

19:16.740 --> 19:18.742
we meet by the big tree
on the edge of town.

19:18.825 --> 19:21.078
Everything in my head is screaming.

19:21.161 --> 19:22.996
All right, then I am off.

19:28.043 --> 19:29.503
Well, hello there.

19:29.586 --> 19:31.964
If it isn't the sexy imbecile.

19:32.047 --> 19:35.551
Oh, hi. Sorry about what I did
to your husband earlier.

19:35.634 --> 19:38.428
Yes, that was quite a hand job
you did on him.

19:38.512 --> 19:41.598
You know, I'm not so bad at those myself.

19:41.682 --> 19:42.808
I'm not gonna lie to you,

19:42.891 --> 19:45.561
you're wasting your double entendres
on me.

19:45.644 --> 19:47.563
I want you to destroy me.

19:47.646 --> 19:48.730
Okay.

19:56.446 --> 19:59.074
<i>Jeepers creepers</i>

19:59.157 --> 20:01.410
<i>Where'd you get those peepers?</i>

20:01.493 --> 20:04.121
<i>Jeepers creepers</i>

20:04.204 --> 20:06.123
<i>Where'd you get those eyes?</i>

20:07.875 --> 20:09.084
Thank you, thank you.

20:09.168 --> 20:12.129
Oh, I just love a song that explains
what it just said.

20:14.089 --> 20:18.051
All right, evidently, I have to go
to the big tree on the edge of town

20:18.135 --> 20:19.178
to take care of something.

20:19.261 --> 20:22.264
This shouldn't take too long,
do not take my songs off the list.

20:28.145 --> 20:30.814
I'm sorry, George,
I didn't mean to kill the girl,

20:30.898 --> 20:33.400
and now the whole town's
gonna hang me by a rope.

20:33.483 --> 20:35.319
Oh, I would never let that happen.

20:35.402 --> 20:36.486
Thanks.

20:36.570 --> 20:38.447
Tell me about the rabbits, George.

20:38.530 --> 20:41.283
Yeah, sure thing. But while I do that,
why don't you face away from me

20:41.366 --> 20:42.534
and count the stars?

20:42.618 --> 20:43.702
Okay.

20:45.204 --> 20:48.874
All right, so the B&B will have a rack
of single-gear bikes for every guest,

20:48.957 --> 20:50.584
and, yes, next to that, of course,

20:50.667 --> 20:52.961
is going to be the big giant rabbit hutch.

20:53.045 --> 20:54.046
Bye-bye, Lennie.

20:55.964 --> 20:58.133
Good night, kids.
Good luck with those book reports.
