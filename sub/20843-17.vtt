00:02.404 --> 00:05.010
‐ Announcer: <i>Previously...</i>
‐ Oh, my goodness. Pasta.

00:05.010 --> 00:06.747
<i>...a tricky</i>
<i>elimination test...</i>

00:06.747 --> 00:08.183
Get in there,
come on now.

00:08.183 --> 00:10.120
<i>...cost Gabriel his apron.</i>

00:10.120 --> 00:12.358
Your cannelloni look like
they've been deflated.

00:13.426 --> 00:14.630
<i>...but not his dreams.</i>

00:14.630 --> 00:18.036
I am gonna send you
to culinary school.

00:18.036 --> 00:21.476
‐ ( all gasp, applaud )
‐ Thank you, Lord.

00:21.476 --> 00:24.382
I can't be happier.
( sobs )

00:24.382 --> 00:26.654
<i>Tonight...</i>

00:26.654 --> 00:29.793
Welcome to the
Triunfo Creek Vineyard.

00:29.793 --> 00:32.799
<i>...it's a picture‐perfect</i>
<i>pop‐up restaurant.</i>

00:32.799 --> 00:35.638
‐ First table,
four filet, two duck.
‐ All: Yes, Chef.

00:35.638 --> 00:37.642
<i>But when things turn ugly</i>
<i>in the kitchen...</i>

00:37.642 --> 00:39.746
‐ Let's go!
‐ Come on, get the food out!

00:39.746 --> 00:42.017
‐ <i>...which team...</i>
‐ It's freezing cold
in the center.

00:42.017 --> 00:44.756
‐ Come on.
‐ <i>...will tear itself apart?</i>

00:44.756 --> 00:46.326
Jeff is a loser.

00:46.326 --> 00:48.831
‐ Thank you so much!
‐ Stop saying thank you
and ( bleep ) cook!

00:48.831 --> 00:50.935
‐ Okay, just stop.
‐ Shut up and plate.

00:50.935 --> 00:52.237
Oh, my God.

00:58.918 --> 01:01.155
‐ Lord, this is beautiful.
‐ Fancy.

01:01.155 --> 01:02.892
Look at this.

01:02.892 --> 01:05.665
To think, right now,
we've beat out thousands
of home cooks,

01:05.665 --> 01:08.838
whittling it down
to the hundreds,
to 40, to 20.

01:08.838 --> 01:12.679
Now to be in the top six?
This is crazy!

01:12.679 --> 01:15.818
‐ Guys, look at that!
‐ Jeff: So beautiful.

01:15.818 --> 01:18.490
There are no
vineyards and wineries
back in Detroit.

01:18.490 --> 01:21.429
Not at all.
I have never been
to a vineyard before.

01:21.429 --> 01:22.666
‐ Beautiful.
‐ Wow.

01:22.666 --> 01:24.035
‐ Thank you, sir.
‐ Look how beautiful.

01:24.035 --> 01:25.170
Good morning.

01:25.170 --> 01:27.341
‐ Hi.
‐ Hey.

01:27.341 --> 01:30.414
It's absolutely amazing.

01:30.414 --> 01:32.886
Welcome, everybody,
to the Triunfo Creek Vineyard.

01:32.886 --> 01:34.790
‐ Thank you, Chef.
‐ Thank you.

01:34.790 --> 01:38.363
Today, we're going to transform
this picture‐perfect vineyard

01:38.363 --> 01:41.603
<i>into a very special</i>
<i>MasterChef pop‐up restaurant.</i>

01:41.603 --> 01:44.075
‐ ( clapping )
‐ Wow.

01:44.075 --> 01:49.385
Today, you'll be cooking
for the best sommeliers locally.

01:49.385 --> 01:53.126
Food critics, writers,
and, of course, chefs.

01:53.126 --> 01:54.495
‐ Eboni: Wow.
‐ Yes.

01:54.495 --> 01:56.299
Eboni and Jason,
since you both

01:56.299 --> 01:58.169
had the best dishes
in that last challenge,

01:58.169 --> 01:59.840
you'll both
be team captains.

01:59.840 --> 02:02.177
Please step up here.

02:02.177 --> 02:05.117
Eboni:
<i>I'm ready to go.</i>
<i>I'm, like, so charged up.</i>

02:05.117 --> 02:07.956
I've never been on a losing team
for a field challenge,

02:07.956 --> 02:10.193
<i>and today I want to show</i>
<i>great leadership</i>

02:10.193 --> 02:12.532
and just excel myself
right into the top five.

02:12.532 --> 02:14.101
‐ Aarón: Eboni?
‐ Yes?

02:14.101 --> 02:16.239
Because you were
the overall winner in
the last challenge,

02:16.239 --> 02:18.711
‐ you will get to pick first.
‐ Who's your pick?

02:18.711 --> 02:21.884
Eboni:
This individual, they have
a phenomenal palette

02:21.884 --> 02:25.056
and they know
how to play on a team.

02:25.056 --> 02:26.994
‐ Cate.
‐ Gordon: Wow, Cate.

02:26.994 --> 02:29.633
‐ Hey, girl.
‐ Cate: <i>Eboni and I</i>
<i>work great together.</i>

02:29.633 --> 02:31.970
<i>We've worked on many team</i>
<i>challenges together</i>

02:31.970 --> 02:34.341
We are just
a dominant force.

02:34.341 --> 02:36.412
‐ Jason.
‐ This particular chef,

02:36.412 --> 02:40.086
there's always
a spark of genius
that's verging on crazy.

02:40.086 --> 02:41.857
Dino.

02:41.857 --> 02:43.828
Dino:
<i>I am happy to be with Jason.</i>

02:43.828 --> 02:46.098
<i>Jason's such a technical guy.</i>
<i>He knows what he's doing.</i>

02:46.098 --> 02:48.469
<i>But what he doesn't</i>
<i>have much is a voice.</i>

02:48.469 --> 02:51.375
If he could find that voice,
he's going to kill it.

02:51.375 --> 02:53.614
Gordon:
The last two standing.

02:53.614 --> 02:57.054
Yachecia, you've been
on the winning team once
and lost three.

02:57.054 --> 03:00.728
Jeff, you have never
been on a winning team.

03:00.728 --> 03:02.064
We're gonna change
that today, Chef.

03:02.064 --> 03:03.233
That's gonna change today.

03:03.233 --> 03:05.237
‐ Eboni.
‐ Yes, Chef.

03:05.237 --> 03:07.474
The ultimate decision
is yours.

03:10.013 --> 03:13.119
I'm actually enthused
to invite Jeff to my team.

03:13.119 --> 03:16.259
I think he has a lot to offer,
so no more last pick.

03:16.259 --> 03:18.129
Thank you.

03:18.129 --> 03:19.933
Eboni:
<i>I'm feeling a little</i>
<i>funky today.</i>

03:19.933 --> 03:21.770
Cate and I have never
been on a losing team,

03:21.770 --> 03:23.674
and Jeff has always
been on a losing team.

03:23.674 --> 03:25.611
‐ Welcome, baby.
‐ Thank you.

03:25.611 --> 03:27.381
I want to try to help him out
and break that.

03:27.381 --> 03:29.485
‐ We're gonna
get you a win today.
‐ We're doing this.

03:29.485 --> 03:33.459
Jason, please hand
your apron to Yachecia.

03:33.459 --> 03:35.196
Yachecia:
<i>Actually, I wanted to be</i>
<i>on Jason's team.</i>

03:35.196 --> 03:38.036
<i>His attention to detail</i>
<i>is amazing,</i>

03:38.036 --> 03:40.808
and that's exactly what's needed
to win this challenge.

03:40.808 --> 03:43.681
Aarón:
Each team will be responsible
for serving half the guests

03:43.681 --> 03:47.387
two amazing appetizers
and two exquisite entrees.

03:47.387 --> 03:49.325
Then we will talk
to all the diners

03:49.325 --> 03:51.228
and see whose dishes
they like the best.

03:51.228 --> 03:54.368
But, ultimately,
we the judges

03:54.368 --> 03:56.840
will decide who wins
the team challenge.

03:56.840 --> 03:59.411
Gordon: Right, you six.
Let's get changed into
our chef whites.

03:59.411 --> 04:02.384
Meet me in the kitchen,
where I'll show you the menu.

04:02.384 --> 04:04.488
‐ All right, Chef.
‐ Thank you!

04:08.029 --> 04:11.903
All right, now, together,
we came up with two appetizers
and two entrees

04:11.903 --> 04:14.475
to serve at today's
beautiful pop‐up restaurant.

04:14.475 --> 04:16.546
All right, Gordon,
take it away.

04:16.546 --> 04:18.984
Gordon:
<i>Let's start off with a warm</i>
<i>scallop salad with grapes</i>

04:18.984 --> 04:20.888
<i>served with a light</i>
<i>frisée salad.</i>

04:20.888 --> 04:23.994
Nice, hot pan.
Flat side down.

04:23.994 --> 04:27.367
These take, on average,
60 seconds each side.

04:27.367 --> 04:29.438
From there,
take your grapes,

04:29.438 --> 04:32.244
touch of salt,
touch of pepper, okay?

04:32.244 --> 04:34.415
Chef Ramsay is flying
through this demo.

04:34.415 --> 04:37.622
Caper raisin vinaigrette.
Frisée salad in.

04:37.622 --> 04:39.926
Searing scallops, sauces,
garnishes.

04:39.926 --> 04:42.765
We'll go four
around the outside,
and one in the middle.

04:42.765 --> 04:44.736
It's daunting.
It's a lot of components

04:44.736 --> 04:47.374
and I am taking the most notes

04:47.374 --> 04:50.146
<i>I have ever taken</i>
<i>since college.</i>

04:50.146 --> 04:52.752
Second dish‐‐
this is a delicious
lobster capellini

04:52.752 --> 04:54.656
<i>served with a chardonnay</i>
<i>beurre blanc,</i>

04:54.656 --> 04:57.094
<i>finished with a beautiful</i>
<i>caviar vinaigrette.</i>

04:57.094 --> 05:01.670
Take the tail and drop it
into my beurre blanc
for four minutes.

05:01.670 --> 05:03.841
Capellini straight in
salty, boiling water.

05:03.841 --> 05:06.880
This is where you need
some skill, okay, guys?

05:06.880 --> 05:08.216
It's all in the timing.

05:08.216 --> 05:10.788
Twist, twist, twist,
push nice and tight,

05:10.788 --> 05:13.594
and there, sit that
on the middle.

05:13.594 --> 05:15.898
‐ All: Oh.
‐ You don't move it.
That is it.

05:15.898 --> 05:18.537
Take the tail,
and you sit that on top.

05:18.537 --> 05:20.808
Drizzle the caviar
vinaigrette.

05:20.808 --> 05:23.212
That is decadence
at its best.

05:23.212 --> 05:27.053
I think the lobster
is going to be the most
difficult to make

05:27.053 --> 05:31.395
because of the poaching
and the technique of the pasta.

05:31.395 --> 05:34.234
It needs to be perfection,
perfection, perfection.

05:34.234 --> 05:37.174
Okay, first main course,
stunning magret de canard,

05:37.174 --> 05:40.413
<i>duck breast</i>
<i>with a truffle polenta,</i>
<i>caramelized turnips,</i>

05:40.413 --> 05:44.321
served with locally‐sourced
cherries, okay?

05:44.321 --> 05:46.593
Now, no fat in there.
Why?

05:46.593 --> 05:48.095
'Cause it's gonna
make its own.

05:48.095 --> 05:49.632
The fat is on the duck.

05:49.632 --> 05:52.037
We turn it over, look.

05:52.037 --> 05:53.807
We kiss it
on the bottom there,

05:53.807 --> 05:56.111
and then
into the oven she goes.

05:56.111 --> 05:58.282
‐ Skin‐side what?
‐ Down.

05:58.282 --> 06:02.390
Now, just smell that polenta,
the incredible truffle butter.

06:02.390 --> 06:05.898
Eboni:
<i>Everything that he's showing us</i>
<i>is so detailed</i>

06:05.898 --> 06:07.133
that we better focus.

06:07.133 --> 06:09.404
Gordon:
<i>Next main course</i>
<i>is a delicious</i>

06:09.404 --> 06:10.841
<i>seared filet mignon</i>

06:10.841 --> 06:11.943
<i>wild mushrooms,</i>
<i>fingerling potatoes,</i>

06:11.943 --> 06:13.947
<i>served with a rich</i>
<i>red wine sauce.</i>

06:13.947 --> 06:16.920
You roll it back and forth.
Now look at the sear on there.

06:16.920 --> 06:18.155
‐ Jeff: Yeah.
‐ Yachecia: Mm‐hmm, beautiful.

06:18.155 --> 06:20.159
A teaspoon
of crème fraîche.

06:20.159 --> 06:22.163
We're gonna go for
a little mushroom
a la crème,

06:22.163 --> 06:25.504
a nice sort
of sour‐y cream sauce.

06:25.504 --> 06:28.042
This is really gonna determine
who has what it takes

06:28.042 --> 06:30.146
to make it to the next level
in the competition

06:30.146 --> 06:31.683
and who is just
out of their depth.

06:31.683 --> 06:33.553
And there we have
a filet of beef

06:33.553 --> 06:35.456
served with
a rich red wine sauce.

06:35.456 --> 06:36.726
It's delicious.

06:36.726 --> 06:39.832
This is your last big challenge.
Can we go out on a high?

06:39.832 --> 06:41.870
‐ All: Yes, Chef!
‐ Let's go, guys.

06:41.870 --> 06:43.139
‐ Come on.
‐ Cate: Go, Blue Team!

06:43.139 --> 06:44.374
Yachecia:
Come on, now.
Let's do it.

06:48.884 --> 06:52.190
Red Team, Blue Team,
as you can see, our guests
are arriving.

06:52.190 --> 06:54.361
Yes, Chef.
Clear down, get ready
for appetizers.

06:54.361 --> 06:56.031
‐ Y'all heard me, right?
‐ Cate: Yes! Yes!

06:56.031 --> 06:58.002
My family, the Stewart family,
owns this vineyard.

06:58.002 --> 07:00.173
<i>I don't think we've ever</i>
<i>had an event quite like</i>
<i>this before.</i>

07:00.173 --> 07:01.876
We're looking forward
to tasting the food

07:01.876 --> 07:04.849
<i>and I hope it can match</i>
<i>our wines and the beautiful</i>
<i>setting.</i>

07:04.849 --> 07:06.185
‐ We're good, we're good.
‐ Okay, cool.

07:06.185 --> 07:07.888
Watch out these pans
getting too hot.

07:07.888 --> 07:09.625
I'm a Cordon Bleu‐trained
chef.

07:09.625 --> 07:12.865
I have worked
in one of Chef Ramsay's
kitchens in London,

07:12.865 --> 07:15.637
so I know that his standards
are very high.

07:15.637 --> 07:17.407
Red Team, Blue Team,
we are open, let's go.

07:17.407 --> 07:20.981
Yachecia:
We are open for business.
Let's go, Red Team!

07:20.981 --> 07:22.384
‐ Cheers.
‐ Cheers.

07:23.820 --> 07:25.223
‐ Chef.
‐ First order?

07:25.223 --> 07:26.593
‐ First two orders.
‐ Excellent.

07:26.593 --> 07:28.663
Red Team, on order,
four covers, table one.

07:28.663 --> 07:30.734
Two lobster, two scallop,
followed by four lobster,
two scallop.

07:30.734 --> 07:32.905
‐ Yes, Chef!
‐ Lobster down!

07:32.905 --> 07:34.575
Gordon:
Let's go, let's go,
let's go.

07:34.575 --> 07:36.679
Blue Team,
four covers, table six.

07:36.679 --> 07:39.284
One lobster, three scallop
followed by two lobster,
two scallop.

07:39.284 --> 07:40.621
‐ Heard?
‐ Yes, Chef!

07:40.621 --> 07:41.856
Three scallops,
one lobster.

07:41.856 --> 07:43.760
Pasta in.

07:43.760 --> 07:45.463
Scallops in the pan, Cate.

07:45.463 --> 07:46.699
Good, let's go.

07:50.473 --> 07:53.980
Jason, how long?
How long for the first table?

07:53.980 --> 07:56.719
‐ Scallops are done.
‐ You gotta talk to me, okay?

07:56.719 --> 07:58.088
Jason, what do you want me
to start next?

07:58.088 --> 08:02.330
Uh, the next ticket
was, uh‐‐ shoot.

08:03.867 --> 08:07.340
‐ Two lobster, two‐‐
‐ Two lobsters, okay.

08:07.340 --> 08:09.044
Yachecia:
Come on, Jason.

08:09.044 --> 08:12.551
The one thing that
I was afraid of happening
is happening.

08:12.551 --> 08:15.791
Jason is very quiet.
He is not calling orders
like he should.

08:15.791 --> 08:19.231
‐ Captain! Captain!
‐ Yes, Chef?

08:19.231 --> 08:21.034
That's you, you donut.

08:21.034 --> 08:22.872
It's like
a silent kitchen in here.

08:22.872 --> 08:25.409
If we shut down
and we don't communicate,

08:25.409 --> 08:27.213
well, it's gonna be
difficult.

08:27.213 --> 08:30.052
If we open up and push
and talk to each other,
it's gonna be a dream.

08:30.052 --> 08:32.290
‐ We need to communicate.
Let's go.
‐ Thank you, Chef.

08:32.290 --> 08:34.294
Dino:
<i>It's gonna be very hard</i>
<i>for a person like Jason.</i>

08:34.294 --> 08:36.465
He needs to start
cracking the whip.

08:36.465 --> 08:37.902
Where's my lobster, Jeff?
How long?

08:37.902 --> 08:39.004
I put the lobster
already up there.

08:39.004 --> 08:40.607
I got pasta coming
to the line right now.

08:40.607 --> 08:42.277
It looks mangled, Jeff.

08:42.277 --> 08:44.481
‐ Eboni: You gotta
cut it better, Jeff.
‐ You got it.

08:44.481 --> 08:46.251
Okay, so that
is undercooked.

08:46.251 --> 08:47.655
Undercooked, Jeff,
on the lobster.

08:47.655 --> 08:48.990
Got it. Heard.

08:48.990 --> 08:50.459
Gordon:
If the lobster's undercooked,

08:50.459 --> 08:52.932
stop slicing it raw
and put it back in the butter.

08:52.932 --> 08:55.336
‐ Absolutely, Chef.
‐ Gordon: It's not difficult.

08:55.336 --> 08:56.973
Jeff, you've got to watch
what you're doing.

08:56.973 --> 08:58.342
I'm getting aggravated.

08:58.342 --> 09:00.514
I've never worked
with Jeff on a team challenge,

09:00.514 --> 09:01.883
<i>but he keeps messing up.</i>

09:01.883 --> 09:04.387
Now, touch that.
What's wrong with that now?

09:04.387 --> 09:06.491
‐ It's overcooked.
‐ It's overcooked,
so that's rubber now.

09:06.491 --> 09:07.928
Now it's overcooked, Jeff.

09:07.928 --> 09:09.832
I hear you, Chef.
Jeff, do you need me
to help you?

09:09.832 --> 09:11.636
‐ No, I got it, I got it.
Thank you so much.
‐ Okay, well, act like it.

09:11.636 --> 09:14.407
Stop saying thank you
and ( bleep ) cook!

09:14.407 --> 09:17.681
I don't know why he's cursed,
but he's cursed.

09:17.681 --> 09:20.353
Cate:
Jeff, I need that lobster
to be clean cut.

09:20.353 --> 09:22.625
‐ You got it, thank you.
‐ And that pasta tighter.

09:22.625 --> 09:25.296
This is ridiculous.
We goin' down, baby,
and fast.

09:25.296 --> 09:27.668
And how about telling him
this lobster is raw?

09:27.668 --> 09:29.437
‐ And the lobster
is raw, Jeff.
‐ You got it.

09:29.437 --> 09:31.008
( groans )

09:39.024 --> 09:41.829
Three lobster, one scallop,
followed by four lobster,
two scallop.

09:41.829 --> 09:44.802
‐ Give me the time, Jeff.
‐ You got it. Give me...

09:44.802 --> 09:45.904
one minute here.

09:45.904 --> 09:47.340
Jeff, can you talk
to Eboni, please?

09:47.340 --> 09:49.377
He don't know how
to communicate, Chef, at all.

09:49.377 --> 09:50.881
It's okay, it's okay.
Don't bash him.

09:50.881 --> 09:52.483
We're on a team together.
We gotta work together.

09:52.483 --> 09:54.555
That's not bashing him.
That's reality, and he
ain't in it right now.

09:54.555 --> 09:56.659
You know what?
This is‐‐ whatever.

09:56.659 --> 09:58.095
Oh, man.

09:58.095 --> 09:59.932
Come on, guys,
please, Blue Team.

09:59.932 --> 10:02.938
Jeff:
<i>I'm struggling with</i>
<i>the lobster, I'll admit it.</i>

10:02.938 --> 10:05.744
But there's no reason
to be a jerk right now.

10:05.744 --> 10:08.783
I see why y'all always lose
with somebody on your team.

10:08.783 --> 10:10.119
Fighting isn't gonna
solve anything.

10:10.119 --> 10:11.522
Fighting is about
to solve something.

10:11.522 --> 10:12.958
I'm about to clean his ass.

10:12.958 --> 10:14.294
Don't worry about
what's happened, all right?

10:14.294 --> 10:15.697
Let's just focus.
It's about how you can‐‐

10:15.697 --> 10:17.768
We got it. Shut up and plate
'cause I'm getting annoyed.

10:17.768 --> 10:19.538
Cate:
<i>I just don't know</i>
<i>what Eboni's thinking.</i>

10:19.538 --> 10:22.945
If you want to yell at somebody,
yell at them to correct them,

10:22.945 --> 10:25.082
<i>not to make them feel stupid.</i>

10:25.082 --> 10:27.086
That's not gonna
lead us to victory.

10:27.086 --> 10:28.556
‐ Gordon: Is it cooked?
‐ Yes.

10:28.556 --> 10:30.927
Tell him that, then.
You can communicate
positive as well.

10:30.927 --> 10:32.564
‐ Jeff, this is perfect.
‐ Thank you.

10:32.564 --> 10:34.067
Much tighter.
Much better proportions
as well.

10:34.067 --> 10:35.637
Yeah, really good job.
These are ready.

10:35.637 --> 10:36.906
‐ Thank you.
‐ Go, please.

10:36.906 --> 10:38.342
‐ Table six, thank you.
‐ Thank you, service.

10:38.342 --> 10:40.680
Let's go.

10:40.680 --> 10:42.316
Jason:
How much time on those
three lobster?

10:42.316 --> 10:43.953
I got two behind you.

10:43.953 --> 10:46.826
Stop‐‐ just touch that.
Cold lobster.

10:46.826 --> 10:50.099
You have got this lobster‐‐
it's not quite through.

10:50.099 --> 10:52.704
Yachecia, get the ends
of that lobster.
Make sure it's cooked.

10:52.704 --> 10:55.342
‐ Okay, I'm comin'.
‐ Come on! You can do it!

10:55.342 --> 10:56.846
Quickly!

10:56.846 --> 10:59.718
<i>There is so much pressure</i>
<i>on me for this challenge today.</i>

10:59.718 --> 11:01.656
I've never been
a team captain.

11:01.656 --> 11:04.060
<i>This is my first</i>
<i>and last opportunity</i>

11:04.060 --> 11:06.131
to prove that I have
a voice in the kitchen,

11:06.131 --> 11:07.500
to have strong leadership.

11:07.500 --> 11:09.270
Come on!
This needs to go back in.

11:09.270 --> 11:11.576
Dino:
<i>This is a Jason</i>
<i>I've never seen before.</i>

11:11.576 --> 11:13.312
I've definitely
never seen him yell.

11:13.312 --> 11:16.853
Stop ( bleep ) around
and get the food out!

11:16.853 --> 11:18.923
That's it.
Hey, finally,
you found your voice.

11:18.923 --> 11:21.863
‐ Now, get a grip.
‐ I think we just got
a new teammate.

11:21.863 --> 11:25.002
Get that lobster on the plate,
beautifully cut.

11:25.002 --> 11:26.706
Gotcha, Jason.

11:30.179 --> 11:32.784
So, you guys got
the Red Team's appetizer.

11:32.784 --> 11:34.688
<i>So, what are</i>
<i>your initial thoughts?</i>

11:34.688 --> 11:37.059
Team Red's scallops
were delicious.

11:37.059 --> 11:40.567
Had a really lovely crust
on them, yet nice and tender.

11:40.567 --> 11:42.169
Beautiful with the grapes.

11:42.169 --> 11:44.140
‐ And the capellini?
‐ I thought it was beautiful.

11:44.140 --> 11:45.577
I really enjoyed
the way it worked.

11:45.577 --> 11:48.382
<i>The caviar, I thought,</i>
<i>brought other dimensions to it.</i>

11:48.382 --> 11:50.720
‐ Aarón: Outstanding.
‐ Thank you, sir.
Appreciate it.

11:50.720 --> 11:53.526
First impressions
on the Blue Team's appetizers?

11:53.526 --> 11:54.895
<i>How about the scallops, guys?</i>

11:54.895 --> 11:56.699
It melted in my mouth
like butter.

11:56.699 --> 11:59.404
<i>Not overcooked.</i>
<i>I thought they were</i>
<i>just perfect.</i>

11:59.404 --> 12:02.376
Guys, you are only
half way there.
Let's go.

12:02.376 --> 12:03.546
Set up for those entrees.

12:03.546 --> 12:05.316
You had the capellini
from the Blue Team.

12:05.316 --> 12:06.619
What are
your initial thoughts?

12:06.619 --> 12:09.457
I was a little worried
when I saw so much
caviar on top.

12:09.457 --> 12:11.394
I thought we were
maybe going overboard,

12:11.394 --> 12:12.965
<i>but it really sang.</i>

12:12.965 --> 12:14.868
We still need
to bounce back, guys.

12:14.868 --> 12:16.505
‐ Yes, we do.
‐ Yeah, we got it.

12:16.505 --> 12:18.910
Jeff, and stop ( bleep )
apologizing and saying
thank you.

12:18.910 --> 12:21.381
Just move, man.
Damn, you act like a girl.

12:21.381 --> 12:24.253
‐ My mama taught me manners.
‐ Okay.

12:26.592 --> 12:27.694
Gordon:
Right, entrees.
Let's go.

12:27.694 --> 12:29.832
Red Team, one duck,
three filet

12:29.832 --> 12:31.067
followed by three duck,
two filet.

12:31.067 --> 12:33.005
Jason:
One duck, three filet.

12:33.005 --> 12:35.275
Gordon: After that,
you've got two duck,
four filets.

12:35.275 --> 12:37.213
One table at a time,
divide and conquer.

12:37.213 --> 12:40.954
‐ Dino: Heard, Chef.
‐ Protein's rockin' and rollin'.
Whoo!

12:40.954 --> 12:42.958
Okay, Blue Team.
We've switched over here.
What's going on?

12:42.958 --> 12:44.895
Yeah, we're ready.
I'm gonna be plating.

12:44.895 --> 12:46.766
‐ Two duck, two filet.
‐ Yeah, two duck, two filet.

12:46.766 --> 12:49.905
‐ Gordon: Followed by
four duck, two filet.
‐ Jeff: You got it, Chef.

12:49.905 --> 12:51.474
All right, Red Team,
Blue Team, let's go.

12:51.474 --> 12:52.778
Jeff:
Mushrooms going in right now.

12:52.778 --> 12:55.282
Coming in, hot, hot.

12:55.282 --> 12:57.587
I got the greens,
you get the polenta.

12:57.587 --> 12:59.490
Make sure that duck
is cooked.

12:59.490 --> 13:02.263
‐ How long before that
first table, guys? Come on.
‐ Dino: Two minutes.

13:02.263 --> 13:05.202
Dino: <i>Right now,</i>
<i>going into the entree</i>
<i>round, we are in unison.</i>

13:05.202 --> 13:07.073
Now, Yachecia's with me,
I'm with Yachecia,

13:07.073 --> 13:08.241
and we are with Jason.

13:08.241 --> 13:10.279
Good, Red Team.
Six top, let's go.

13:10.279 --> 13:11.949
‐ We're in system now.
‐ Yes, Chef.

13:11.949 --> 13:13.786
‐ Stay on track.
‐ Yes, sir.

13:13.786 --> 13:18.061
If Red Team can keep this up,
we just might win.

13:18.061 --> 13:19.965
Blue Team, four duck,
two filet, yes?

13:19.965 --> 13:22.637
‐ Yes, Chef.
‐ So, I've got three duck,
two filet here.

13:22.637 --> 13:25.777
Where's the duck?
It's coming, Chef.

13:25.777 --> 13:27.614
Come on, guys.
The beef's cold.

13:27.614 --> 13:31.321
These plates are so detailed
that you have to be doing
six things at once.

13:31.321 --> 13:35.095
It's just insane.
Like, I need octopus arms.

13:35.095 --> 13:38.435
‐ Where's the duck breast?
‐ Coming. Just slicing, Chef.

13:38.435 --> 13:40.940
Go with the three duck, please.
Go with the three duck.

13:40.940 --> 13:43.445
Guys, I'm serving tables
that aren't complete.

13:43.445 --> 13:44.581
Does anyone care here?

13:44.581 --> 13:46.451
‐ Yes, we do care.
‐ Yes, we care, Chef.

13:46.451 --> 13:48.856
Eboni, just stop panicking
and get a bit of cohesion
together.

13:48.856 --> 13:50.192
Yes, Chef.

13:50.192 --> 13:51.361
Jeff:
<i>Communication's breaking down.</i>

13:51.361 --> 13:53.165
<i>Eboni is our</i>
<i>front‐line defense.</i>

13:53.165 --> 13:55.302
We're not talking
ticket times.

13:55.302 --> 13:58.275
We're not talking
about where we are in
the stages of the cooks.

13:58.275 --> 13:59.711
What's the next
order, please?

13:59.711 --> 14:01.649
I just told you,
I need the same order.

14:01.649 --> 14:03.151
Everything up!

14:03.151 --> 14:04.655
We don't got nothin' up!

14:04.655 --> 14:05.990
Jeff:
<i>Give us our numbers,</i>

14:05.990 --> 14:07.493
<i>because if we don't</i>
<i>get those counts,</i>

14:07.493 --> 14:09.163
we don't know
what we need to do.

14:13.773 --> 14:16.311
Good afternoon.
Entrees from the Red Team.

14:16.311 --> 14:18.783
‐ All: Yes.
‐ First impressions?

14:18.783 --> 14:22.256
Great flavor,
but a lot of inconsistency
on the cooking.

14:22.256 --> 14:24.126
Christina:
<i>Okay.</i>

14:24.126 --> 14:25.597
What about you, sir?

14:25.597 --> 14:27.701
The duck was good.
We all shared
here a little bit.

14:27.701 --> 14:30.472
‐ Okay.
‐ We had a steak
that was a disaster.

14:30.472 --> 14:32.042
It's way overdone.

14:32.042 --> 14:34.715
‐ It's so overcooked,
it's gray.
‐ Yeah.

14:34.715 --> 14:36.552
I'm looking
at your duck breast.

14:36.552 --> 14:39.190
I think that skin
could've been rendered
just a little bit more.

14:39.190 --> 14:41.729
It's a bit underdone.
I apologize.

14:41.729 --> 14:46.538
Clearly our standards
at "MasterChef" are much
higher than that.

14:46.538 --> 14:47.641
Let's go, let's go,
let's go.

14:54.988 --> 14:57.694
Oh, man.
Red Team!

14:57.694 --> 15:00.365
All of you, come here.

15:00.365 --> 15:02.436
Get a pair of horns
and some fur

15:02.436 --> 15:05.777
and stick
that ( bleep ) thing
back in the field.

15:05.777 --> 15:07.647
Touch that.

15:07.647 --> 15:09.383
It's not gonna bite.
Boo.

15:09.383 --> 15:11.220
It's ( bleep ) dead.
It's raw, look.

15:11.220 --> 15:12.824
That is ice cold.

15:14.226 --> 15:15.830
‐ Where's the duck?
‐ Right there, Chef.

15:17.734 --> 15:21.407
Oh, my God.
It's still got its
( bleep ) beak on there.

15:21.407 --> 15:23.579
Hey, look.

15:23.579 --> 15:25.550
All it's missing
is its feathers.

15:25.550 --> 15:28.088
Get me a river and it will
( bleep ) swim in there.

15:28.088 --> 15:30.359
Look at me,
are you gonna wake up?

15:30.359 --> 15:32.062
Or I take
those aprons off now.

15:32.062 --> 15:33.766
Christina, Aarón,
and myself

15:33.766 --> 15:35.837
will jump in there
and you can go pour wine.

15:35.837 --> 15:38.776
‐ No, Chef.
‐ Now, wake up! Let's go.

15:38.776 --> 15:42.282
Jason:
One filet, three duck.
Come on! Don't give up!

15:42.282 --> 15:46.023
Take the beef, table four.
come back for the duck.

15:46.023 --> 15:48.629
It's just migrating
back from ( bleep ) Brazil.

15:54.039 --> 15:55.877
Get a pair of horns
and some fur

15:55.877 --> 15:58.816
and stick that ( bleep ) thing
back in the field.

15:58.816 --> 16:00.720
Touch that.
That is ice cold.

16:00.720 --> 16:04.493
This is so frustrating.
We have to get our cook spot on

16:04.493 --> 16:06.030
<i>for the duck and the filet</i>

16:06.030 --> 16:08.435
or we are losing
this challenge for sure.

16:08.435 --> 16:11.240
‐ Is this still over?
‐ No, it's not over.
Look, come on.

16:11.240 --> 16:13.746
‐ That's pink, yeah.
‐ Why have you lost
your marbles again?

16:13.746 --> 16:15.182
I'm not.
I'm just getting frustrated.

16:15.182 --> 16:16.585
You know that's perfect!
Look, it's pink!

16:16.585 --> 16:18.254
I'm getting frustrated
because we're behind.

16:18.254 --> 16:20.025
Don't get frustrated,
sort it out!

16:20.025 --> 16:22.129
‐ Come on, come on.
‐ Let's do this.

16:24.233 --> 16:26.037
Y'all gotta get focused
'cause I can't come back there.

16:26.037 --> 16:27.874
‐ I gotta stick to this.
‐ Yes, Chef.

16:27.874 --> 16:29.276
All right, let's go,
come on.

16:29.276 --> 16:31.047
Eboni, I want you to take
a look at how I'm dressed.

16:31.047 --> 16:33.652
I see how you're dressed, Chef.
You don't gotta take
over my kitchen.

16:33.652 --> 16:36.057
Eboni, you gotta
get going, honey.

16:36.057 --> 16:38.127
Cate:
<i>Right now, we're</i>
<i>just trying to keep up.</i>

16:38.127 --> 16:40.298
We are all moving
100 miles an hour.

16:40.298 --> 16:41.568
<i>It's just chaos.</i>

16:41.568 --> 16:42.937
Talk to your team,
tell 'em what you need.

16:42.937 --> 16:45.108
Come on, Jeff.
I need those potatoes.

16:45.108 --> 16:48.014
Cate:
<i>So, hopefully, with Chef Aarón</i>
<i>at the front now,</i>

16:48.014 --> 16:50.753
we can finish strong
and work together as a team.

16:50.753 --> 16:52.924
Clean that, clean that.
Come on, Ebi, call for service.

16:52.924 --> 16:54.594
‐ Service!
‐ Table eight.

16:54.594 --> 16:57.634
‐ What's the next, Chef?
‐ Three ducks, five filets.

16:57.634 --> 17:00.640
‐ Heard.
‐ Aarón: Come on, let's go.

17:02.877 --> 17:04.246
Good afternoon.
How are you?

17:04.246 --> 17:06.618
‐ Hi, Chef.
‐ How's the Blue Team's filet?

17:06.618 --> 17:09.591
Filet is fantastic for me.

17:09.591 --> 17:11.260
Filet is fantastic for you.

17:11.260 --> 17:13.164
Mine's rare, very rare.

17:13.164 --> 17:17.239
And I love
a good, bloody filet
mignon, but it's rare.

17:17.239 --> 17:18.943
Christina:
I'm so sorry.

17:18.943 --> 17:20.746
Would you mind
if I take it back
to the Blue Team?

17:20.746 --> 17:23.586
It's clearly not up to
our standards, absolutely.

17:23.586 --> 17:25.856
‐ Can somebody come help me?
‐ I got you, I got you.

17:25.856 --> 17:28.127
Eboni:
I cannot do it all.

17:28.127 --> 17:32.637
Chef Aarón, it's rare.
It's freezing cold
in the center.

17:32.637 --> 17:34.774
‐ Okay.
‐ Go back in there
and refire that right now.

17:34.774 --> 17:37.680
I need a refire on a filet.
Get me a new one in there.

17:37.680 --> 17:38.882
You got it.
Refire in.

17:38.882 --> 17:40.720
‐ Oh, come on.
‐ Oh, come on.

17:40.720 --> 17:43.291
Eboni:
<i>I cannot believe that we're</i>
<i>serving undercooked food.</i>

17:43.291 --> 17:45.295
Jeff is a loser.

17:45.295 --> 17:47.199
And that's why he's always
been on a losing team.

17:47.199 --> 17:49.904
Chef Aarón, I'm walking
with that refire.

17:49.904 --> 17:52.309
Jeff, come on,
let's go, baby.
Let's go.

17:54.648 --> 17:57.486
( indistinct chatter )

17:57.486 --> 18:00.058
Gordon:
Jason, can anyone speed up there
on the Red Team?

18:00.058 --> 18:03.264
Come on, don't give up!
You gotta work fast, come on.

18:03.264 --> 18:04.934
I'm dragging seven duck.

18:04.934 --> 18:06.605
Ah, don't put that in there
with this.

18:06.605 --> 18:08.676
‐ I gotta baste it.
I need to baste it.
‐ Just keep going!

18:08.676 --> 18:11.113
I had the Red Team
duck breast today.

18:11.113 --> 18:13.719
<i>I thought it was</i>
<i>cooked very well.</i>
<i>I thought it was seasoned good.</i>

18:13.719 --> 18:16.057
I was actually very impressed
to see what they were
capable of doing.

18:17.125 --> 18:18.394
Come on, we need
one more duck.

18:18.394 --> 18:21.133
I'm certified sommelier
in four different countries.

18:21.133 --> 18:23.204
<i>I know my wine and food,</i>

18:23.204 --> 18:26.210
and today,
Red Team did awesome.

18:28.381 --> 18:31.487
Let's go. Final table.
Reputation's on the line.
Let's do it.

18:31.487 --> 18:34.761
I thought
the Blue Team's duck breast
was a little underdone,

18:34.761 --> 18:37.567
but as you can see,
I ate the whole darn thing.

18:37.567 --> 18:39.704
For the love of Baby Jesús.

18:39.704 --> 18:42.075
‐ This is for Jesús.
‐ Come on.

18:42.075 --> 18:44.179
The Blue Team's filet mignon
was underdone,

18:44.179 --> 18:46.217
but personally for me,
I enjoyed it.

18:46.217 --> 18:48.856
<i>The overall dish presentation</i>
<i>was very, very nicely done.</i>

18:48.856 --> 18:51.060
Great flavors.
I think they did a good job.

18:51.060 --> 18:53.599
Come on, Chef, inside.
Don't plate on the circles.
Come on!

18:53.599 --> 18:55.201
‐ Move, move, move!
‐ Get your mess.
Let's go, come on.

18:55.201 --> 18:56.905
‐ Service.
‐ Service!

18:56.905 --> 18:59.878
Damn, Jeff, just stop it, okay?
Just leave it.

18:59.878 --> 19:02.048
‐ Just get it done.
‐ All right, ( bleep ) it.

19:02.048 --> 19:03.519
We got it done.

19:03.519 --> 19:07.994
Last table. Go.
Go, go, go, go, go.

19:07.994 --> 19:09.831
I just finished Red Team's
filet mignon,

19:09.831 --> 19:11.735
but I'm finished with Team Red

19:11.735 --> 19:14.039
because I didn't really like
the filet.

19:14.039 --> 19:15.876
It was a little
too overcooked for me.

19:23.357 --> 19:25.128
Ladies and gentlemen,
good evening.

19:25.128 --> 19:27.600
Let me just say
it was an absolute pleasure
being given the opportunity

19:27.600 --> 19:31.040
to cook for such an esteemed
array of unique guests.

19:31.040 --> 19:35.081
Please give a warm welcome to
the Red Team and the Blue Team,
ladies and gentlemen.

19:35.081 --> 19:39.089
( cheers, applause )

19:39.089 --> 19:41.728
With the top five
so close in sight

19:41.728 --> 19:43.632
and the finale
just around the corner,

19:43.632 --> 19:46.136
<i>I'm feeling incredibly nervous</i>
<i>thinking that</i>

19:46.136 --> 19:48.675
we have not done enough
to outshine the Blue Team.

19:48.675 --> 19:51.915
Gordon, Aarón, and myself
tasted all the dishes tonight,

19:51.915 --> 19:54.687
spent a lot
of time with all of you,
our fabulous guests,

19:54.687 --> 19:57.793
and after much discussion,
we do have a decision.

19:57.793 --> 20:00.633
Eboni:
<i>I've never lost a team</i>
<i>field challenge,</i>

20:00.633 --> 20:01.968
and I'm not trying
to lose one today,

20:01.968 --> 20:04.106
<i>so let's hope</i>
<i>that Jeff's mistakes</i>

20:04.106 --> 20:07.680
were not that bad
to make us lose.

20:07.680 --> 20:09.617
Christina:
The winning team,

20:09.617 --> 20:13.659
the team that is officially
in the top five

20:13.659 --> 20:15.696
of the "MasterChef"
competition...

20:15.696 --> 20:17.700
is...

20:22.409 --> 20:23.645
the Red Team!

20:23.645 --> 20:26.651
( all cheering )

20:30.024 --> 20:32.395
Red Team, congratulations.

20:32.395 --> 20:35.836
Oh, God, thank you, thank you,
thank you, thank you.

20:35.836 --> 20:39.409
Blue Team,
unfortunately all three of you

20:39.409 --> 20:41.514
are heading into
a pressure test.

20:41.514 --> 20:43.384
Please go clean up
your kitchen.

20:43.384 --> 20:45.355
Have a good night.
Thank you.

20:45.355 --> 20:49.096
I now boast the only record,
a first in "MasterChef" history,

20:49.096 --> 20:53.805
of going 0 and 5
for team challenges.

20:53.805 --> 20:54.974
It sucks.

20:54.974 --> 20:57.780
First pressure test.
I'll be ready for it.

20:57.780 --> 21:01.453
I mean, I don't think...
we did a bad job.

21:01.453 --> 21:03.992
I think we just got beat.

21:03.992 --> 21:06.998
‐ It's not one person's fault.
‐ ( chuckles )

21:06.998 --> 21:09.704
Jeff is bad luck.
There's nothing else to say.

21:09.704 --> 21:11.273
‐ I ain't giving
nobody no free pass.
‐ Who cares?

21:11.273 --> 21:14.947
Hey, your attitude is real‐‐
boy, if we was not
in this setting,

21:14.947 --> 21:17.520
‐ I'd light your ass up
on a real street.
‐ Good for you.

21:17.520 --> 21:20.959
You gonna look like an idiot.
You stand up cry, whine,

21:20.959 --> 21:24.032
bitch and moan, complain
it's everybody else's fault
but Jeff's.

21:24.032 --> 21:25.536
I'm over it.

21:41.233 --> 21:43.772
Let's go, guys.
Welcome back.

21:46.009 --> 21:47.680
<i>First time with</i>
<i>my black apron on,</i>

21:47.680 --> 21:50.184
not only is my winning streak
ruined...

21:50.184 --> 21:51.788
Line up, please, guys.

21:51.788 --> 21:54.861
...but now I have to go into
my first pressure test.

21:54.861 --> 21:57.132
Now, we know that yesterday's
team challenge

21:57.132 --> 21:59.937
was extremely
intense for all of you,
let's get that right.

21:59.937 --> 22:01.373
‐ Yes.
‐ Mm‐hmm.

22:01.373 --> 22:03.144
‐ Yes.
‐ Eboni, let's cut straight
to the chase.

22:03.144 --> 22:05.414
‐ Yes, Chef.
‐ What happened?

22:05.414 --> 22:08.889
There was pretty much
no communication whatsoever,

22:08.889 --> 22:13.164
and honestly,
I believe I know why Jeff
is always on the losing team.

22:13.164 --> 22:15.001
Because when he gets
instruction,

22:15.001 --> 22:16.905
he still wants to do
what Jeff wants to do

22:16.905 --> 22:19.109
instead of following suit
with what's best for the team.

22:19.109 --> 22:20.812
I'm gonna call ( bleep )
to all of that.

22:20.812 --> 22:23.585
Any time that there was
anything that needed
to be done, I did it.

22:23.585 --> 22:25.789
I didn't do it
with any attitude.
I didn't do it with any gripe.

22:25.789 --> 22:28.360
The negativity
centered from the top down.

22:28.360 --> 22:32.870
Instead of trying to empower,
it was a "push down" type
of a leadership style,

22:32.870 --> 22:35.208
one that is unsuccessful
for anything that's going to be
of a "MasterChef" worthiness.

22:35.208 --> 22:37.713
Eboni:
Okay, can I interject?
Let's be for real.

22:37.713 --> 22:38.949
I got four kids at home.

22:38.949 --> 22:40.451
One is about to turn 17.

22:40.451 --> 22:44.226
I know how to
control a situation,
defuse a situation.

22:44.226 --> 22:48.167
Jeff is so cocky and arrogant,
he wants to do what Jeff
wants to do.

22:48.167 --> 22:49.804
( bleep ) happens,
and we fixed it.

22:49.804 --> 22:52.408
‐ That's the bottom line.
‐ We shouldn't have had
to fix it.

22:52.408 --> 22:54.079
‐ We took it as a team,
we did it.
‐ I ain't gonna go back

22:54.079 --> 22:57.051
‐ and forth with you, baby.
‐ Likewise,
'cause it's fruitless.

22:57.051 --> 22:58.755
At the end of the day,
we as a team, we failed.

22:58.755 --> 23:00.157
The three of us are going
to be battling it out

23:00.157 --> 23:01.260
and we're just gonna have to do
what we gotta do, that's it.

23:01.260 --> 23:02.930
Wah, wah, wah,
wah, wah, wah.

23:02.930 --> 23:06.971
Problem with the Blue Team,
you worked against each other.

23:06.971 --> 23:09.209
And the feedback
and the amount of ( bleep )

23:09.209 --> 23:12.015
that Christina had to take
in the dining room
was extraordinary.

23:12.015 --> 23:15.555
We've said it time and time
again that these challenges
get tougher and tougher,

23:15.555 --> 23:19.229
and only the strongest
will survive.

23:20.565 --> 23:23.905
Right.
Tonight for your pressure test,

23:23.905 --> 23:27.579
you'll be making one of the most
technical and challenging dishes
in the entire world.

23:32.088 --> 23:35.929
It is so delicate
and so tricky to pull off

23:35.929 --> 23:38.100
that even the strongest
and the most experienced chefs

23:38.100 --> 23:40.572
anywhere in the world
can blow it.

23:40.572 --> 23:43.110
Tonight, to earn your place
in the top five...

23:43.110 --> 23:46.684
technical,
tempermental,

23:46.684 --> 23:48.688
terrifying...

23:52.896 --> 23:54.967
‐ soufflé.
‐ Oh, yes!

23:54.967 --> 23:57.305
‐ Oh.
‐ Soufflé.

23:57.305 --> 24:00.545
‐ Done deal.
‐ A stunning chocolate soufflé.

24:00.545 --> 24:04.419
Light, airy,
and total perfection,

24:04.419 --> 24:06.423
but be careful.

24:09.262 --> 24:12.335
The slightest slip
of judgment,

24:12.335 --> 24:15.441
and this soufflé
will fall flat,

24:15.441 --> 24:18.782
literally.

24:18.782 --> 24:19.950
‐ Ooh.
‐ Mmm.

24:19.950 --> 24:21.119
( laughing )

24:21.119 --> 24:22.723
Jason, would you like some?

24:22.723 --> 24:25.194
‐ Yes, please.
‐ ( bleep ) off, it's mine.

24:25.194 --> 24:27.566
( laughter )

24:27.566 --> 24:28.768
Now, Eboni, why are you
so excited about one of
the most technical‐‐

24:28.768 --> 24:31.908
'Cause I love pastries,
and I can do it.

24:31.908 --> 24:34.547
Cate, what's your experience
with soufflés?

24:34.547 --> 24:38.822
I make them all the time,
both sweet and savory.
I love them.

24:38.822 --> 24:42.428
Wow. Jeff, we know that desserts
are an Achille's heel.

24:42.428 --> 24:44.299
‐ I don't like soufflés,
personally.
‐ You don't like soufflés?

24:44.299 --> 24:45.735
‐ I don't like soufflés.
‐ Wow.

24:45.735 --> 24:47.673
Jeff:
I'm not a big sweet guy
to begin with.

24:47.673 --> 24:49.442
I know I've got to work on that,
but at the end of the day,

24:49.442 --> 24:51.112
you gotta be
three steps ahead.

24:51.112 --> 24:53.651
‐ Three steps
out the door tonight.
‐ Whoo‐hoo.

24:53.651 --> 24:55.187
She been waiting all day
for saying that one.

24:55.187 --> 24:56.657
( laughter )

24:56.657 --> 24:58.460
Listen, guys,
it's a tough ask.

24:58.460 --> 25:01.968
Every cooking technique
you've studied so far
in this competition

25:01.968 --> 25:03.905
is gonna come
into play tonight.

25:03.905 --> 25:06.276
Everything you've got.

25:06.276 --> 25:08.146
Show us you deserve
to stay.

25:08.146 --> 25:10.484
‐ Girls: Yes, Chef.
‐ Jeff?

25:10.484 --> 25:13.323
‐ Yes, Chef.
‐ Please, all three of you,

25:13.323 --> 25:14.459
head back to your stations.

25:14.459 --> 25:15.762
‐ Yeah.
‐ Let's go, guys.

25:15.762 --> 25:18.300
‐ It's time to rise.
‐ About to earn my keep.

25:18.300 --> 25:20.170
Eboni:
<i>Chocolate soufflé.</i>

25:20.170 --> 25:21.741
<i>This pressure test</i>
<i>is super hard.</i>

25:21.741 --> 25:23.778
Luckily I make that
all the time at home

25:23.778 --> 25:25.682
for my kids and family,
baby, so...

25:25.682 --> 25:27.018
<i>now it's no longer a team.</i>

25:27.018 --> 25:28.855
<i>It's every man or woman</i>
<i>for theyself.</i>

25:28.855 --> 25:30.491
Let's go.

25:30.491 --> 25:32.295
At your stations you'll have
everything that you need

25:32.295 --> 25:35.200
to make your MasterChef‐worthy
chocolate soufflé.

25:35.200 --> 25:37.973
Sugar, butter,
heavy cream, eggs,

25:37.973 --> 25:39.877
cream of tartar,
and dark chocolate.

25:39.877 --> 25:42.849
And for this challenge,
you're only bringing us one.
Understood?

25:42.849 --> 25:45.220
All: Yes, Chef.

25:45.220 --> 25:48.895
Tonight, all three of you
have 35 minutes

25:48.895 --> 25:50.397
to get yourself
into the top five

25:50.397 --> 25:53.036
to keep your dreams alive.

25:53.036 --> 25:55.407
Your 35 minutes...

25:55.407 --> 25:57.411
starts...

25:59.215 --> 26:00.919
now.

26:00.919 --> 26:02.689
‐ Good luck, guys.
‐ Good luck.

26:02.689 --> 26:05.528
Come on, come on, come on.
You can do this.

26:07.799 --> 26:09.369
Yachecia:
Like that game face, Cate.

26:09.369 --> 26:11.306
These three, they're fighting
for their lives

26:11.306 --> 26:13.878
in the most daunting
pressure test ever.

26:13.878 --> 26:17.653
Every soufflé needs
three or four attempts
to get one right.

26:17.653 --> 26:20.391
It is culinary
Russian roulette.

26:20.391 --> 26:24.065
‐ Finesse, Jeff.
‐ Gordon: Now, who are we
expecting to shine tonight?

26:24.065 --> 26:25.401
I think Jeff's
gonna nail tonight.

26:25.401 --> 26:26.837
Say what you will
about his attitude,

26:26.837 --> 26:28.240
about his approach
in team challenges.

26:28.240 --> 26:29.910
‐ I disagree. Jeff? Stop it.
‐ But this guy's got, like,

26:29.910 --> 26:32.415
‐ nine lives, Gordon.
‐ He's gone past those
nine lives, sorry.

26:32.415 --> 26:34.987
Dessert or not, time and time,
he's made it out alive.

26:34.987 --> 26:37.759
‐ I think my money is on Eboni.
‐ Really? Why so?

26:37.759 --> 26:39.763
Gordon:
She loves soufflés.
She's smart.

26:39.763 --> 26:41.166
And she wants to send a message,
not just to Jeff,

26:41.166 --> 26:43.938
but to everybody on the balcony,
that she's in it to win it.

26:43.938 --> 26:45.742
‐ I think for me,
it has to be Cate.
‐ No way.

26:45.742 --> 26:48.681
She's so detail‐oriented.
I think she's really gonna
focus on dessert.

26:48.681 --> 26:50.184
‐ But she's never been
in a pressure test.
‐ That's right.

26:50.184 --> 26:52.288
Christina:
Jeff has been
in four pressure tests,

26:52.288 --> 26:54.392
and each one of those
pressure tests, he's made it.

26:54.392 --> 26:57.064
Aarón:
I think Cate is too good of a
cook to fall down on this one.

26:57.064 --> 26:59.035
Stay focused, guys.

26:59.035 --> 27:01.206
Gordon:
25 minutes remaining.

27:01.206 --> 27:02.341
In under ten minutes
from now,

27:02.341 --> 27:05.347
you need to have some soufflés
in the oven.

27:09.088 --> 27:11.426
‐ Jeff, how we feeling,
my brother?
‐ Doing well.

27:11.426 --> 27:13.664
Okay, so you don't consider
yourself a baker

27:13.664 --> 27:15.100
‐ or a pastry whiz, right?
‐ That's correct.

27:15.100 --> 27:17.037
But it's all about precision.
It's all about the science,

27:17.037 --> 27:19.008
and I think I'm into
a good head start right now.

27:19.008 --> 27:20.745
So now you're gonna start
to make your ganache?

27:20.745 --> 27:22.616
‐ That's right.
‐ Aarón: You have your egg
whites separated.

27:22.616 --> 27:24.118
‐ And you have your yolks
already done.
‐ Yep.

27:24.118 --> 27:25.955
Oh, man, you look like
you're well ahead of the game.

27:25.955 --> 27:27.424
Thank you so very much, Chef.

27:27.424 --> 27:29.630
All right, so what concerns you
the most about this soufflé?

27:29.630 --> 27:31.466
It's all about the chemistry
and it's about the timing of it,

27:31.466 --> 27:34.071
so I did six ramekins,
so that way then I can have
the best ones,

27:34.071 --> 27:35.909
and I'm gonna have them timed
to different intervals.

27:35.909 --> 27:39.248
‐ Jeff, you've come a long way.
You've been through a lot.
‐ Completely.

27:39.248 --> 27:42.388
And I think it's very important
for you to conquer this
challenge, okay?

27:42.388 --> 27:43.991
‐ I certainly do.
‐ Good luck.

27:43.991 --> 27:45.995
Thank you very much, Chef.

27:48.568 --> 27:50.003
Yachecia:
Good job, Eboni.

27:50.003 --> 27:52.843
Soufflés need love in order
to make them rise.

27:52.843 --> 27:55.013
‐ Absolutely.
‐ So, jeopardy for tonight,

27:55.013 --> 27:57.284
first of all, those egg whites
need to be whipped
to a stiff peak.

27:57.284 --> 28:00.090
Secondly, if that sugar's
not incorporated
at the right time,

28:00.090 --> 28:02.562
that can cause a deflation
and less aeration
of that soufflé.

28:02.562 --> 28:05.133
‐ Christina: Yes.
‐ Gordon: Also, that chocolate,

28:05.133 --> 28:06.871
I'd be doing it
over a double boiler

28:06.871 --> 28:09.576
and letting it melt naturally
with the water rolling
underneath it.

28:09.576 --> 28:12.549
‐ Not too fast.
‐ Watch that chocolate,
watch that heat.

28:12.549 --> 28:17.659
But the big key point tonight,
the timing has to be down
to perfection.

28:17.659 --> 28:20.798
As soon as that clock tonight
ticks 15 minutes, that is it.

28:20.798 --> 28:23.003
They need to be going
to the oven.

28:23.003 --> 28:25.007
18 minutes remaining.

28:27.979 --> 28:30.183
Guys, you gotta multitask.
Get the egg whites whipping

28:30.183 --> 28:32.522
at the same time
as melting your chocolate.

28:32.522 --> 28:34.091
Yachecia:
Good job, Cate.

28:34.091 --> 28:36.262
‐ Beautiful whites, Eboni,
beautiful.
‐ ( Dino howls )

28:36.262 --> 28:40.270
Guys, these next two minutes
are gonna be crucial
to success.

28:40.270 --> 28:42.341
Christina:
You gotta go, guys.

28:42.341 --> 28:44.680
‐ Aarón: We gotta push.
‐ That soufflé mixture
needs to be made.

28:44.680 --> 28:46.550
You need to start getting
those soufflés in the oven.

28:46.550 --> 28:48.788
Move it,
young lady.

28:48.788 --> 28:51.727
Just under 16 minutes to go.
Come on.

28:51.727 --> 28:53.798
Can somebody bring me
my ramekins?

28:53.798 --> 28:54.900
Jeff, can you bring her
her ramekins?

28:54.900 --> 28:56.737
( laughter )

28:56.737 --> 28:59.408
Christina:
If you don't get it in the oven
in the next 60 seconds,

28:59.408 --> 29:02.348
you're not even going to have
a baked soufflé. Come on.

29:04.786 --> 29:06.590
There you go guys,
get that batter in.

29:06.590 --> 29:10.263
We know those souffles take
at least 15 minutes to cook.

29:10.263 --> 29:14.706
Come on guys.
It's gotta go in.
It's gotta go in.

29:14.706 --> 29:16.710
They've all run out of time.
What they've got now,

29:16.710 --> 29:18.279
they've got to get it in
because look,

29:18.279 --> 29:21.052
‐ 15 minutes to go.
‐ Aarón: Come on, guys.
We gotta get it going.

29:21.052 --> 29:23.557
‐ Guys, get it in the oven.
‐ Soufflés have got to be
in the oven.

29:23.557 --> 29:26.229
‐ Christina: Ugh.
‐ Gordon: Please.
They won't get done in time.

29:26.229 --> 29:27.565
‐ Christine: Let's go.
‐ Aarón: Come on, Cate.

29:27.565 --> 29:30.404
Wow.
Wow, wow, wow. Ugh.

29:36.315 --> 29:39.055
Gordon:
Just over 15 minutes to go.

29:39.055 --> 29:40.558
‐ Christina: Come on,
come on, come on.
‐ Aarón: Come on, Cate.

29:40.558 --> 29:44.165
We know those soufflés take
at least 15 minutes to cook.

29:44.165 --> 29:45.868
Come on, guys.
It's gotta go in.

29:45.868 --> 29:48.273
‐ Christina:
Guys, get it in the oven.
‐ Gordon: Those soufflés

29:48.273 --> 29:49.509
have got to be in the oven.

29:49.509 --> 29:51.112
Aarón:
Eboni, you gotta go.

29:51.112 --> 29:52.916
Good job, Eboni.
There you go.

29:52.916 --> 29:55.521
Eboni's in the oven.

29:55.521 --> 29:58.694
Jeff's in.
Keep that door closed.
Quickly, guys.

29:58.694 --> 30:01.800
‐ Yachecia: Good job, good job.
‐ Gordon: 14 1/2 minutes to go.

30:01.800 --> 30:05.107
‐ Gotta get it in the oven.
‐ Aarón: Let's go, Cate.

30:05.107 --> 30:06.944
‐ It's gonna be beautiful.
‐ She finally just put it in.

30:06.944 --> 30:08.581
Yachecia:
Stay focused, guys.
Get some more.

30:08.581 --> 30:10.117
‐ Let's get some more.
‐ Gordon: Get some more
in there.

30:10.117 --> 30:13.089
If you're running behind,
crank up that temperature, guys.

30:13.089 --> 30:14.960
Yachecia:
Get some insurance, guys.

30:14.960 --> 30:16.964
Christina: Come on, Jeff,
get that one in the oven.

30:16.964 --> 30:19.836
Jeff's got two in.
Eboni's got three in.

30:19.836 --> 30:23.276
‐ Don't slam the door.
‐ Quickly. Don't slam it.
Yes, good job.

30:23.276 --> 30:26.282
Eboni is determined.

30:26.282 --> 30:28.954
‐ Aarón: Come on, Cate.
Let's go.
‐ Jason: Good job, Cate.

30:28.954 --> 30:30.791
Right now, all they
can do is pray.

30:30.791 --> 30:31.793
Yes.

30:33.363 --> 30:36.970
Cate: This is money.
Yachecia, talk to God for me
right now.

30:36.970 --> 30:40.477
I got you, girl.
Watch the grass grow.
Watch the grass grow.

30:40.477 --> 30:41.613
‐ Cate?
‐ Yes, Chef?

30:41.613 --> 30:43.049
Aarón: I want to see
the victory soufflé.

30:43.049 --> 30:45.387
You want to come take a peek?
This one looks good.

30:45.387 --> 30:47.357
He's perfect.
He's got no bubbles.

30:47.357 --> 30:48.661
I'm happy that you put it
in the middle.

30:48.661 --> 30:51.165
That means it's getting attacked
by heat from all over.

30:51.165 --> 30:54.038
Hopefully the baking gods
are above me

30:54.038 --> 30:56.309
and it's gonna be beautiful.

30:56.309 --> 30:58.012
Well, it does look promising,
Miss Cate.

30:58.012 --> 30:59.248
‐ I'm praying.
‐ All right.

30:59.248 --> 31:00.685
Very confident
in my batter.

31:01.853 --> 31:03.489
Right, Jeff,
soufflé's in the oven.

31:03.489 --> 31:05.193
Yes. I've got a total
of four in there.

31:05.193 --> 31:06.362
Young man, if you get through
this pressure test...

31:06.362 --> 31:08.333
‐ Yeah?
‐ it's gonna be amazing.

31:08.333 --> 31:10.805
‐ It will be. Top five.
‐ How you feeling? Why are you
so hard on yourself?

31:10.805 --> 31:12.842
‐ Because I want to be like you.
‐ I'd love you to be like me.

31:12.842 --> 31:14.846
But you're too hard
on yourself.

31:14.846 --> 31:17.451
Where is this exterior
coming from, wall of steel.

31:17.451 --> 31:19.121
Getting through to you is like
getting into the Pentagon.

31:19.121 --> 31:22.562
‐ Yeah. Fort Knox over here.
‐ Yeah, but why?
What am I missing?

31:22.562 --> 31:25.901
Because I just want to make sure
that I do things the right way
and do it the best way.

31:25.901 --> 31:27.972
‐ Get yourself in the top five.
‐ That's it.

31:27.972 --> 31:29.341
‐ ( bleep ) it.
‐ Yep.

31:29.341 --> 31:31.312
That's exactly
what I'm going for.
Thank you very much, Chef.

31:33.349 --> 31:36.757
‐ Eboni, how you looking?
‐ Yes, Chef.
I'm playing a waiting game.

31:36.757 --> 31:39.061
Let's take a look at 'em.
How much longer does
this one have?

31:39.061 --> 31:41.533
I think another 2 1/2 minutes.
I got five minutes.

31:41.533 --> 31:43.871
So I'm gonna say another 2 1/2
and I can test that one.

31:43.871 --> 31:45.440
‐ It's starting to rise.
‐ Yes.

31:45.440 --> 31:47.945
These could be your ticket
to the top five

31:47.945 --> 31:50.116
‐ or your ticket home.
‐ Yeah.

31:50.116 --> 31:53.222
All right,
Thank you, Chef.

31:53.222 --> 31:57.632
‐ Come on, ovens.
‐ Waiting game.
I know it's tough.

31:57.632 --> 32:00.403
Gordon:
<i>Three minutes to go.</i>

32:00.403 --> 32:02.341
Christina:
Now Eboni's cranked
both of her ovens up.

32:02.341 --> 32:04.746
‐ How do they look?
‐ Good. They're delicate.
They look beautiful.

32:04.746 --> 32:06.717
They're rising.
How's Cate looking?

32:06.717 --> 32:10.190
Her victory soufflé she got in
with just under 15 minutes,

32:10.190 --> 32:12.361
and I have to say,
it looks beautiful.

32:12.361 --> 32:17.037
Gordon:
The big question is
what soufflé are you serving?

32:17.037 --> 32:19.074
‐ Yachecia: Pick the money.
‐ Cate's got soufflés out.

32:19.074 --> 32:21.445
‐ Here we go.
‐ Cate: This is money.

32:21.445 --> 32:23.249
‐ Aarón: One minute, guys.
‐ Gordon: 60 seconds to go.

32:23.249 --> 32:25.387
This is it!

32:25.387 --> 32:27.625
‐ Eboni's got
a little soufflé out.
‐ Look at Eboni's.

32:27.625 --> 32:30.564
Whoo.
I sure see some beautifulness.

32:30.564 --> 32:33.604
Jeff's bringing one out.
That looks great, Jeff.
Looks amazing.

32:33.604 --> 32:37.277
‐ Yachecia: Yes, yes.
‐ Gordon: 30 seconds to go.

32:37.277 --> 32:40.618
Remember, lift it carefully.
Lightly dust it.

32:40.618 --> 32:43.991
And one soufflé
must hit the front table.

32:43.991 --> 32:46.596
15 seconds to go.
Jeff, you gotta go.

32:46.596 --> 32:47.799
Yachecia:
You gotta get it to the front.

32:47.799 --> 32:50.437
‐ ( Dino howls )
‐ That's beautiful, Cate.

32:50.437 --> 32:54.679
‐ Gordon: Ten...
‐ All: Nine, eight, seven,

32:54.679 --> 32:57.284
six, five, four,

32:57.284 --> 33:00.023
three, two, one.

33:00.023 --> 33:02.762
‐ Stop.
‐ Hands in the air.

33:02.762 --> 33:05.534
Gordon:
Well done. Incredible.

33:05.534 --> 33:07.905
Wow, I am speechless.

33:07.905 --> 33:10.477
<i>All three of the competitors</i>
<i>have risen soufflés.</i>

33:10.477 --> 33:13.216
<i>All three of those soufflés</i>
<i>look amazing.</i>

33:13.216 --> 33:15.420
This is going to be
a nail‐biter.

33:16.489 --> 33:18.259
( sighs )

33:18.259 --> 33:19.996
‐ Jeff?
‐ Yes, Chef?

33:19.996 --> 33:22.467
Is this your best soufflé?

33:22.467 --> 33:24.506
Jeff: <i>Yeah,</i>
<i>this one was a very good one.</i>

33:24.506 --> 33:26.510
It got the height
that I wanted.

33:52.460 --> 33:53.564
( sighs )

33:55.868 --> 33:58.339
<i>I mean,</i>
<i>I feel like I nailed it,</i>

33:58.339 --> 34:00.243
but taste is going to be
a deciding factor.

34:00.243 --> 34:03.750
The texture is incredible.
The liquid in the center,

34:03.750 --> 34:05.955
I thought the egg whites
were gonna be too runny.

34:05.955 --> 34:08.994
Jeff:
<i>Right now, I have no idea</i>
<i>what Gordon Ramsay's thinking.</i>

34:08.994 --> 34:11.332
The actual texture
is mind‐blowing.

34:17.143 --> 34:20.483
All right, Eboni, is this
the best soufflé you had?

34:20.483 --> 34:22.454
Eboni: <i>Yes, from my choice,</i>
<i>that's what I would have chose.</i>

34:22.454 --> 34:24.358
Okay. Did this cook by itself
or cook with other ones?

34:24.358 --> 34:26.362
It cooked with two other ones.

34:53.082 --> 34:55.053
( sighs )

34:55.053 --> 34:56.523
Eboni:
<i>I'm so nervous right now.</i>

34:56.523 --> 34:59.227
I just hope that it's the right
amount of salt and sweet
balance.

34:59.227 --> 35:01.933
The chocolate
is so beautifully melted.

35:01.933 --> 35:04.204
You can see it by the color,
it's not too dark.

35:04.204 --> 35:05.841
It's airy and luscious.

35:05.841 --> 35:08.179
Eboni:
<i>I mean, I just really</i>
<i>deserve to be here.</i>

35:08.179 --> 35:11.519
My passion is to cook.
I've never had the opportunity
to go to culinary school

35:11.519 --> 35:13.857
or nothing like that
'cause I couldn't afford it
being a teen mom.

35:13.857 --> 35:16.095
<i>But now it's about me.</i>

35:16.095 --> 35:18.365
For me, I would like to see
just a touch more rise on it.

35:18.365 --> 35:20.871
But the flavor,
the composition,
is textbook.

35:30.591 --> 35:35.567
Cate, how did you incorporate
that chocolate into the mixture?

35:35.567 --> 35:39.709
Very gently.
My major focus was to make sure

35:39.709 --> 35:41.913
that the egg whites
were incorporated properly.

35:41.913 --> 35:43.415
All right.

36:11.071 --> 36:13.643
( exasperated sigh )
Tell me something.
Give me some type of feedback

36:13.643 --> 36:15.581
so I know if I did good
or not.

36:15.581 --> 36:18.152
Gorgeous.
Light, fluffy.

36:18.152 --> 36:20.958
Just perfectly gooey
in the center.

36:20.958 --> 36:22.895
Cate:
<i>The judges don't</i>
<i>say anything to us,</i>

36:22.895 --> 36:24.599
<i>so we're all just, like,</i>

36:24.599 --> 36:28.940
<i>did somebody do bad?</i>
<i>Did we all do good?</i>

36:28.940 --> 36:32.781
How do you separate
these three? How?

36:32.781 --> 36:36.255
I don't know what's going on,
but it's gonna be details.

36:36.255 --> 36:37.958
<i>They're looking for something.</i>

36:37.958 --> 36:41.933
We're just like deer
in the headlights.

36:41.933 --> 36:43.435
I disagree.

36:53.890 --> 36:57.998
Jeff, Eboni, Cate,
let's be honest.

36:57.998 --> 37:01.071
A soufflé is, without doubt,
one of the most difficult things

37:01.071 --> 37:04.010
we ever ask amateur
home cooks to do.

37:04.010 --> 37:07.918
You all gave
a very strong effort.

37:07.918 --> 37:09.755
Aarón:
We are getting down
to the very best,

37:09.755 --> 37:13.763
and tonight's decision,
frankly, will not be easy.

37:13.763 --> 37:17.303
We need a moment to discuss.
We'll make it as quick
as we can.

37:17.303 --> 37:19.307
Thank you.

37:21.946 --> 37:23.717
Jeff:
<i>Everyone's already</i>
<i>discounted me.</i>

37:23.717 --> 37:25.186
One, I'm not the dessert guy.

37:25.186 --> 37:26.856
Two, I'm definitely
not a soufflé guy,

37:26.856 --> 37:29.227
<i>but instead of letting that</i>
<i>get the best of me,</i>

37:29.227 --> 37:31.632
<i>I channel all that energy</i>

37:31.632 --> 37:34.004
into making the best soufflé
of my life.

37:34.004 --> 37:36.408
<i>Don't think I'm out</i>
<i>of the game yet.</i>

37:36.408 --> 37:39.548
Guys, three stunning
chocolate soufflés.

37:39.548 --> 37:41.385
Jeff's was delicious
in the center.

37:41.385 --> 37:42.988
I'm amazed Jeff's
got that high.

37:42.988 --> 37:45.259
It was there.
Eboni had the most height.

37:45.259 --> 37:48.399
Stunning. Eboni played
with those oven temperatures,

37:48.399 --> 37:51.238
and it absolutely paid off
with both body and bake.

37:51.238 --> 37:54.210
Aarón:
Cate put her soufflé
in for 14 1/2 minutes,

37:54.210 --> 37:56.081
and I think that actually
saved her.

37:56.081 --> 37:57.417
'Cause it didn't overcook.

37:57.417 --> 37:59.354
Best 35 minutes of my life.

37:59.354 --> 38:00.524
Yeah.

38:00.524 --> 38:02.260
We need to make
a decision, guys.

38:02.260 --> 38:04.197
We're talking
about splitting hairs.

38:04.197 --> 38:06.903
‐ No one made a mistake.
‐ I've never seen this.

38:06.903 --> 38:09.207
‐ A long way we have come.
‐ It's up to them.

38:19.528 --> 38:21.899
You three, well done.

38:21.899 --> 38:25.874
That was the most intense,
the most incredible 35 minutes

38:25.874 --> 38:27.544
in the history
of this competition.

38:27.544 --> 38:29.114
‐ Thank you, Chef.
‐ Thank you.

38:29.114 --> 38:32.053
‐ Thank you.
‐ I'm gonna cut to the chase
like never before.

38:34.892 --> 38:38.065
The first person progressing
through to the next stage...

38:41.806 --> 38:43.810
congratulations...

38:47.316 --> 38:48.953
Jeff.

38:48.953 --> 38:50.724
Well done.

38:50.724 --> 38:53.328
That soufflé was perfect.
Rich, sumptuous, incredible.

38:53.328 --> 38:57.470
‐ Thank you.
‐ A great height, great body,
great texture,

38:57.470 --> 39:01.178
‐ and just a soufflé to die for.
‐ Thank you very much.

39:01.178 --> 39:04.284
Now, Eboni, Cate,

39:04.284 --> 39:06.454
this comes down
to two incredible competitors.

39:06.454 --> 39:09.027
This is really hard.

39:09.027 --> 39:12.033
Both of you put in
a incredible performance,
let's get that right.

39:14.237 --> 39:17.043
The next person through

39:17.043 --> 39:19.247
to the next stage
of the competition...

39:19.247 --> 39:22.386
congratulations...

39:22.386 --> 39:24.390
can't believe
I'm saying this...

39:26.494 --> 39:28.900
Eboni.

39:28.900 --> 39:32.006
Oh, well done.
Soufflé was immaculate.

39:32.006 --> 39:36.782
Timing was perfect,
and the texture was incredible.

39:36.782 --> 39:38.452
‐ Thank you, Chef.
‐ Gordon: Well done.

39:38.452 --> 39:42.493
And that means...

39:42.493 --> 39:44.798
Cate.

39:44.798 --> 39:48.873
Get to go back home
to Chicago.

39:48.873 --> 39:51.344
Cate, you're wrong,
young lady.

39:51.344 --> 39:55.219
You also are going through.

39:55.219 --> 39:58.292
‐ Your soufflé was incredible.
‐ No.

39:58.292 --> 40:00.396
‐ Cate, Eboni, and Jeff...
‐ ( cheers, applause )

40:00.396 --> 40:03.468
...we cannot separate
your soufflés.

40:03.468 --> 40:06.676
‐ Well done, all three of you.
‐ Thank you.

40:06.676 --> 40:09.080
That's awesome.

40:09.080 --> 40:11.384
‐ Gordon: Incredible.
‐ Cate: That's crazy.

40:11.384 --> 40:14.324
Gordon:
We have never, ever,
come to a decision

40:14.324 --> 40:17.430
where we cannot separate
three incredible soufflés.

40:17.430 --> 40:19.902
Each one of your soufflés
was good enough

40:19.902 --> 40:22.574
to hit any of our restaurants'
table this evening.

40:22.574 --> 40:25.245
‐ Thank you. Thank you.
‐ Flawless, Jeff.
Eboni, perfection.

40:25.245 --> 40:27.450
Cate, incredible.

40:27.450 --> 40:29.420
There is nothing
to send you home on.

40:29.420 --> 40:30.957
Why you gotta
do that to me?

40:30.957 --> 40:32.961
( laughter )

40:32.961 --> 40:36.569
Now, all three of you,
head up to the balcony.
Well done.

40:36.569 --> 40:37.971
‐ Yeah!
‐ Get up here!

40:37.971 --> 40:40.042
‐ Whoo!
‐ Thank you. Thank you
very much. Thank you.

40:40.042 --> 40:41.277
‐ Yes!
‐ Yes!

40:41.277 --> 40:42.714
‐ Get up here!
‐ Dude!

40:42.714 --> 40:45.653
( all cheering )

40:45.653 --> 40:47.456
Incredible.
Amazing.

40:47.456 --> 40:49.561
‐ Whoo.
‐ Said you were gonna do it.
Yes, you did.

40:49.561 --> 40:53.503
Listen please, guys.
Look to your left and
look to your right,

40:53.503 --> 40:57.611
'cause one of you will be
America's next MasterChef.

40:57.611 --> 40:58.913
‐ Get some rest. Thank you.
‐ Well done.

40:58.913 --> 41:00.517
‐ All: Bye, thank you.
‐ Gordon: Well done.

41:01.685 --> 41:04.457
Oh, my God.

41:04.457 --> 41:06.194
Announcer:
<i>Next week the top six...</i>

41:06.194 --> 41:08.465
‐ Lift.
‐ <i>...gets a mystery box...</i>

41:08.465 --> 41:11.037
‐ Oh!
‐ <i>...that hits close to home.</i>

41:11.037 --> 41:13.275
( sobbing )

41:13.275 --> 41:14.310
<i>And then...</i>

41:14.310 --> 41:18.418
‐ Three, two, one.
‐ Christina: Go!

41:18.418 --> 41:19.988
<i>...in a race against time...</i>

41:19.988 --> 41:23.228
‐ Now!
‐ <i>...who will beat the clock?</i>

41:23.228 --> 41:26.501
‐ Aarón: Get moving.
‐ One of you will be left
with just 20 minutes.

41:26.501 --> 41:29.173
This is nearly impossible.

41:29.173 --> 41:33.181
<i>And who will reach the end</i>
<i>of their "MasterChef" journey?</i>

41:33.181 --> 41:34.651
The salmon's raw.
