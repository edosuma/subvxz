You did blow my mind, because
I thought I was listening to a song,

And then an alien communiqué
took place in the middle of the song.

11:28.667 --> 11:30.301
That is his real name.

11:30.313 --> 11:32.023
His mama named him
D'Brickashaw Ferguson.

11:32.176 --> 11:34.798
Someone asked her, "Where'd
his name come from, ma'am?"

11:34.810 --> 11:37.777
And she said, "it's a family name."
Bitch, it ain't no family name.

11:37.865 --> 11:39.196
That is not a family name!

11:39.243 --> 11:42.385
We ain't talking about the "Ferguson."
We talkin' about "D'Brickashaw," bitch!

11:43.752 --> 11:45.736
- Where you get that?
- D'Brickashaw.

11:46.045 --> 11:49.081
There's, like, three different nouns
in your son's first name.

11:49.143 --> 11:50.677
- Come on!
- Come on, now.

11:50.772 --> 11:52.743
Just threw letters
in a bucket, and just went...

11:52.791 --> 11:54.995
[grunting]

11:55.050 --> 11:56.884
-Leodis McKelvin.
- Leodis McKelvin.

11:56.884 --> 11:59.228
What are we, in Middle Earth?
Who is this?

11:59.292 --> 12:01.678
I knew a girl... I knew... Well,
I didn't know... I didn't know her,

12:01.748 --> 12:04.323
but I knew about a girl who
went to a school back home.

12:04.414 --> 12:08.035
My girl's name was spelled
L-hyphen-A. "La-dash-A."

12:08.089 --> 12:11.367
- Mm. Mm-mm, mm-mm,
mm-mm, mm-mm.

12:14.313 --> 12:16.114
Let's see here.
Red... Red hills of Georgia.

12:16.126 --> 12:17.927
He, uh, got that out there.

12:17.966 --> 12:19.967
[chuckles]

12:20.341 --> 12:21.541
Okay, you know what?

12:21.554 --> 12:23.249
All right, here... Here's something...
Here's something new.

12:23.316 --> 12:24.783
Here's something brand new.

12:24.783 --> 12:27.171
How... Okay, this is off,
me talking off the top of my head

12:27.171 --> 12:28.738
here, everybody.
Uh, what...

12:28.778 --> 12:32.480
How about if we let, uh,
black people enslave

12:32.492 --> 12:33.837
white people for... [crowd boos]

12:33.904 --> 12:36.778
Okay, you know, that sounded a lot
better in my head before I said it.

12:36.846 --> 12:39.788
[booing continues] So that, uh,
that wouldn't work.

12:40.392 --> 12:44.012
Is it warm?
Is anybody else warm?

12:45.394 --> 12:46.482
Whoo!

12:48.032 --> 12:50.000
[soul music]

12:50.373 --> 12:52.675
I, uh, I vacuumed
my carpet the other day.

12:52.686 --> 12:55.373
A [bleep] ounce of weed came out
of this mother[bleep].

12:56.139 --> 12:58.975
I have gotten high
walking into your home.

12:59.015 --> 13:00.616
- Yes.
- Simply on the...

13:00.656 --> 13:03.816
I just... I walk into his apartment.
I go straight to the refrigerator.

13:03.893 --> 13:04.993
- I just...
- That's right.

13:06.256 --> 13:08.261
Nah, nah, we're just kidding.
Just kidding. We didnt...

13:08.307 --> 13:10.346
Just kidding... I didn't
vacuum my apartment at all.

13:10.449 --> 13:11.939
[laughs]

13:13.274 --> 13:15.077
Wouldn't do it.
Would never do that.

13:15.120 --> 13:17.449
Would never waste
that kind of good product...

13:17.479 --> 13:18.266
[laughs]

13:18.267 --> 13:19.349
 On the floor. I could just be...

13:19.413 --> 13:22.452
You have saved a lot of money not
buying vacuum cleaners in your life.

13:22.500 --> 13:25.031
I'll just be sitting, watching T.V,
talking about, "Yeah, yeah."

13:25.212 --> 13:26.824
[laughs]

13:30.780 --> 13:34.149
Carpet.
That [bleep]'s just carpet.

13:35.275 --> 13:36.914
[sirens wailing
in the distance]

13:37.916 --> 13:41.890
- This weed is mad tight, yo.
- Yeah, man, I'm super high, Dog.

13:42.056 --> 13:43.649
Ah.

13:45.645 --> 13:46.616
Hey, yo.

13:47.046 --> 13:49.347
Let me "ax" you a question
on the real.

13:50.084 --> 13:52.052
Yeah, yeah, Dog.
Yeah, go ahead, man.

13:54.793 --> 13:57.161
Hey, man,
where my dookie go?

13:57.948 --> 13:59.191
[chuckles]

14:02.658 --> 14:04.067
Oh.

14:05.303 --> 14:07.433
- What?
- My dookie.

14:08.252 --> 14:09.811
Where do it go?

14:09.886 --> 14:11.944
It go down in the toilet,
[bleep], you know that.

14:12.404 --> 14:14.972
Nah, man. I ain't stupid.

14:16.460 --> 14:18.060
Where do it go after that?

14:18.072 --> 14:19.682
Come on, man, quit playing.
I don't know.

14:19.696 --> 14:22.391
It... it goes down the sewer,
you know.

14:23.522 --> 14:25.272
Everybody's go down there?

14:25.374 --> 14:28.176
Yeah, everybody's dookie
goes down in the sewer.

14:34.232 --> 14:35.603
Where my dookie go after that?

14:35.617 --> 14:36.784
[scoffs]

14:36.824 --> 14:39.006
It washes out to the ocean.

14:39.971 --> 14:40.938
I guess.

14:40.979 --> 14:43.102
Hold up, hold up.

14:44.348 --> 14:46.916
Dolphins swim
with my dookie?

14:46.953 --> 14:49.862
I don't know, man. I mean,
I don't... I really don't know.

14:49.904 --> 14:51.504
- We're in the ocean...
- Yep.

14:51.544 --> 14:53.078
What happens to the dookie?

14:53.424 --> 14:56.249
I'm just taking a stab at...
like a wild guess, all right,

14:56.343 --> 14:59.121
that the dookie, like,
probably go up in the air

14:59.169 --> 15:02.288
and, like, evaporates and then
turns into a cloud or some [bleep].

15:02.333 --> 15:05.669
- A dookie cloud.
- Oh, this [bleep].

15:05.669 --> 15:08.502
- Everybody's dookie
mix up,

15:08.989 --> 15:12.574
goes up into a cloud,
and then it rains down.

15:12.627 --> 15:13.893
That's gangsta.

15:13.910 --> 15:16.434
I just... Can we stop talking
about dookie right now?

15:18.922 --> 15:20.156
I just thought of something.

15:20.223 --> 15:21.673
Yes? What is it?
What is it, Levi?

15:21.713 --> 15:23.147
The pieces of my dookie...

15:23.188 --> 15:24.929
- Yep?
- ...falls on the ground...

15:24.972 --> 15:25.924
- That's true, yep.

15:25.934 --> 15:27.435
...and becomes a plant.

15:27.475 --> 15:30.120
Okay, okay, that's good. Now,
we're done with the dookie talk, right?

15:30.133 --> 15:32.522
- A dookie plant...
- No.

15:32.564 --> 15:36.500
...that reaches towards the sky.

15:36.595 --> 15:37.981
Ahh.

15:39.315 --> 15:42.532
- Hey, Sed.
- Yeah, Levi?

15:42.944 --> 15:46.090
Maybe if my dookie
can make it out of the hood...

15:47.744 --> 15:49.671
Maybe we can too.

15:51.899 --> 15:53.389
Huh.

15:57.171 --> 15:58.473
Maybe.

15:59.750 --> 16:01.511
Maybe, Levi.

16:04.789 --> 16:06.077
Okay, okay, okay.

16:06.085 --> 16:07.609
Here's what we gonna do.
Here's what we gonna do.

16:07.643 --> 16:10.411
All right, Dr. King
talked about, um, uh,

16:10.423 --> 16:12.176
all the races coming together,
right? Right?

16:12.186 --> 16:14.888
So what I want every negro
to do here today

16:14.900 --> 16:17.392
is find the nearest white person
and give 'em a hug.

16:17.407 --> 16:18.941
Just... just give 'em
a hug, okay?

16:19.009 --> 16:20.743
No, sir,
you're not being attacked.

16:20.755 --> 16:22.920
You're not being attacked.
You're being hugged, okay?

16:22.930 --> 16:25.515
Everybody take it easy here, okay?
Everybody relax.

16:25.527 --> 16:28.696
You know what? We don't need 10 negroes
hugging one white person, okay?

16:28.731 --> 16:30.865
Let's just... let's...
You know, that's the new rule.

16:30.877 --> 16:32.567
Not ten on one.
One on one.

16:32.723 --> 16:34.456
So we'll just take turns
and everything, okay?

16:34.497 --> 16:35.998
So everybody relax, okay?
[crowd shouting]

16:36.038 --> 16:38.743
Oh, my Goodness.
Sir, she doesn't need to be defended.

16:38.890 --> 16:41.585
She doesn't need to be defended.
She's okay. She's okay, okay?

16:41.649 --> 16:43.109
[crowd shouting]
All right, ma'am... okay...

16:43.122 --> 16:44.611
Officer,
is that necessary?

16:44.652 --> 16:46.119
I don't think
that's necessary, officer.

16:46.131 --> 16:47.613
[sirens wail, horse whinnies]
No, ma'am, please!

16:47.627 --> 16:48.627
[dogs bark, women scream]
Please take it easy, sir!

16:48.627 --> 16:49.957
Everyone take it easy,
all right?

16:49.957 --> 16:51.795
They're just hugs.
You're not being attacked.

16:51.998 --> 16:53.585
[loud screams, sirens wailing]

16:57.141 --> 16:59.008
[soul music]

16:59.967 --> 17:02.165
Sometimes it's very difficult
to get black people,

17:02.175 --> 17:03.864
especially black men, to laugh.

17:03.876 --> 17:05.810
They are begrudging
laughers.

17:05.823 --> 17:07.590
Black dudes be... Look...
they'll be looking at us like,

17:07.603 --> 17:10.170
"Nah, see, nah, this ain't gonna
be funny. This ain't gonna be funny."

17:10.215 --> 17:13.175
- We'll do something stupid...
- ...that really crack 'em up.

17:13.176 --> 17:14.699
These mother[bleep]s go,
"Psh, you stupid."

17:14.699 --> 17:15.632
[snickering]
"This is stupid."

17:15.644 --> 17:18.185
"You bein' stupid.
You bein' stupid."

17:18.214 --> 17:19.446
"Nah, man."

17:19.487 --> 17:20.888
"Y'all bein' stupid right now."

17:20.932 --> 17:22.057
"nah, that's stupid, man. Nah."

17:22.057 --> 17:23.390
- "I ain't laughing."
- "Y'all stupid."

17:23.390 --> 17:24.953
- "I ain't laughing."
- "This thing is stupid."

17:24.981 --> 17:27.694
"Nah, nah, that ain't funny.
I ain't laughing at [bleep]."

17:27.711 --> 17:29.241
- "Dog, that's stupid."
- "Nah, nah."

17:29.275 --> 17:30.809
- "That's stupid!"
- "That's stupid as Hell.

17:30.849 --> 17:33.309
"That's stupid as Hell.
No, no, no.

17:33.372 --> 17:36.074
"No, these [bleep]s retarded.
These [bleep]s retarded."

17:36.087 --> 17:37.994
I think sisters
are actually harder.

17:38.038 --> 17:41.569
Sisters talk about, "[bleep], ain't
my job to laugh. It's your job to..."

17:41.570 --> 17:43.546
Both: "make me laugh."
[laughs]

17:48.839 --> 17:51.796
White people laugh a certain way,
which is, like, too hard.

17:51.880 --> 17:53.217
- Too hard, yeah.
- Just too hard.

17:53.255 --> 17:56.223
It's a little too earnest, yes, yeah.
It's a little onomatopoetic.

17:56.267 --> 17:58.235
We do not need to be able
to spell your laughter.

17:58.276 --> 17:59.710
- We don't want to.
- Please don't do that.

17:59.777 --> 18:02.079
"Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho."
Don't do it.

18:02.090 --> 18:03.686
Yeah, we... we don't need you
to be laughing like,

18:03.731 --> 18:06.132
"Ha, ha, ha,
ha, ha, ha, ha."

18:06.896 --> 18:09.598
No [bleep] Mitt Romney
laughter here tonight.

18:11.649 --> 18:14.518
<i>[Hail to the Chief</i> plays]

18:15.533 --> 18:17.292
- Good evening,
my fellow Americans.

18:17.339 --> 18:20.859
Now, first off, I would like
to once again introduce

18:20.871 --> 18:22.471
my anger translator, Luther.

18:22.511 --> 18:23.185
Hi!

18:23.266 --> 18:26.795
Now, in the spirit of democracy,
I would like to take a moment

18:26.845 --> 18:28.623
to address my opponent,
Mitt Romney.

18:28.639 --> 18:30.223
Ooh, I been waiting for this.

18:30.413 --> 18:33.115
Oh, boy,
I been waiting for this.

18:33.266 --> 18:34.799
Wassup, Mitt?
Ta-tai!

18:34.895 --> 18:37.775
Governor Romney
and I have different ideas

18:37.870 --> 18:39.930
on how to best help
the American people.

18:40.056 --> 18:41.590
I saved the auto industry.

18:41.630 --> 18:43.663
You wanna give tax breaks
to millionaires.

18:43.727 --> 18:45.327
I killed osama bin laden,

18:45.367 --> 18:48.106
And you strapped a dog
to the top of your car.

18:48.203 --> 18:50.571
Now, let's see.
Who's better for the country?

18:50.639 --> 18:53.908
I look forward to a fruitful
and healthy debate

18:53.976 --> 18:55.159
On the affordable care act.

18:55.171 --> 18:57.178
And since you already did it
in Massachusetts,

18:57.190 --> 19:00.278
It's gonna be <i>real</i> interesting
to watch your flip-floppin' ass

19:00.305 --> 19:03.277
argue me on that [bleep] now!
Sa-si-san!

19:03.373 --> 19:06.961
But I also look forward to other ways
to articulate our differences.

19:06.983 --> 19:08.682
I'm like the mother[bleep]
love child

19:08.717 --> 19:11.886
of the Old Spice guy
and the Dos Equis dude,

19:11.899 --> 19:13.867
and you are literally

19:13.906 --> 19:17.566
the boringest,
whitest man alive today.

19:17.581 --> 19:21.699
I know that we will conduct
professional campaigns,

19:21.986 --> 19:24.996
That we will be respectful
to one another's personal lives,

19:25.012 --> 19:26.112
families, and religion.

19:26.180 --> 19:27.429
Oh, man, come on.

19:27.471 --> 19:30.888
I still gotta explain to half
the country that I'm not a Muslim,

19:30.895 --> 19:33.223
But it's still off limits
to talk about

19:33.258 --> 19:35.953
your mormon ass wearing
magic underwear

19:35.966 --> 19:39.733
and believing Jesus came down
and did some [bleep] in Pennsylvania?

19:39.785 --> 19:41.256
- All right now, Luther.
- I mean, come on, man!

19:41.256 --> 19:42.958
I mean,
this is some craziness!

19:42.992 --> 19:44.125
- Luther!
- This be..yes.

19:44.126 --> 19:47.267
Luther, Pennsylvania is a swing state.
Let's take it down a notch.

19:47.267 --> 19:48.767
Yeah, okay.
Come on, Luther.

19:48.774 --> 19:52.511
Man, why you always gotta
cross the line, man?

19:52.701 --> 19:54.988
I believe
the American people will see

19:55.059 --> 19:57.877
that I've made their lives
better in the past four years.

19:57.946 --> 20:01.436
Americans would all be riding these
if I hadn't saved the auto industry.

20:01.454 --> 20:02.754
[horn squeaks]

20:02.850 --> 20:05.985
I'm also confident
that the American people

20:06.081 --> 20:08.549
will make the choice
that will best help them

20:08.589 --> 20:11.357
and best help our path
to the future.

20:11.397 --> 20:13.550
Y'all know
I'm winning this [bleep]!

20:13.815 --> 20:16.083
- Thank you,
and good night.

20:16.291 --> 20:19.126
[dubstep version
of <i>hail to the chief</i> plays]

20:21.145 --> 20:23.954
[cheers and applause]

20:26.062 --> 20:27.496
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

20:27.898 --> 20:29.832
I love it.
I love playing Luther.

20:29.871 --> 20:31.511
- You do, huh?
- It's my favorite part.

20:31.523 --> 20:32.890
Well, any excuse you can get
to... to...

20:32.930 --> 20:34.197
Yeah, I get to use
one of those... Oh, swa!

20:34.207 --> 20:37.084
Nope, um,
just almost ripped my taint.

20:37.084 --> 20:39.082
- Okay. Thank you guys.
- Thank you very much.

20:39.098 --> 20:40.766
