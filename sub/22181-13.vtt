WEBVTT

00:01.569 --> 00:02.603
Previously on Supergirl...

00:02.636 --> 00:05.506
You have friends, too.
There are others like you.

00:05.539 --> 00:08.542
You just need to know
how to find them.

00:08.576 --> 00:10.578
So two of these
are our Worldkillers, huh?

00:10.611 --> 00:12.146
It's her.
So what do we do?

00:12.180 --> 00:13.514
We go get her.

00:40.574 --> 00:43.144
Okay, we've got
one heat signature inside.

00:43.177 --> 00:46.280
No movements. Looks like
we might catch
this Worldkiller off guard.

00:46.314 --> 00:48.782
But be careful,
in case she's as bad as Reign.

00:48.816 --> 00:51.085
Copy that, Winn.
Watch our backs.

00:51.119 --> 00:52.286
You got it.

01:05.333 --> 01:07.501
Winn, what's your 20
on the heat signature?

01:08.336 --> 01:10.504
Looks like a back room.

01:10.538 --> 01:12.706
* And this woman
Was singing my song*

01:12.740 --> 01:15.709
* Lovers in love
And the others run away*

01:15.743 --> 01:17.311
Is that Lisa Loeb?

01:17.345 --> 01:19.247
I thought the target's name
was Julia Freeman.

01:19.280 --> 01:22.716
* You say
I only hear what I want to*

01:22.750 --> 01:25.119
* I don't listen hard
I don't pay attention*

01:25.153 --> 01:28.722
* To the distance
That you're running
To anyone anywhere*

01:28.756 --> 01:30.458
Is it her?

01:30.491 --> 01:31.759
* I don't understand
If you really care *

01:31.792 --> 01:32.893
* I'm only hearing negative*

01:32.926 --> 01:34.728
* So I turned the radio on*

01:34.762 --> 01:37.298
Yeah, that's her all right.

01:37.331 --> 01:40.501
* So by the time that
We're waiting for the other
Who was dyin' since the day *

01:46.240 --> 01:48.376
Supergirl, what...

01:48.409 --> 01:50.278
What are you...
What are you doing here?

01:52.813 --> 01:54.515
Are you Julia Freeman?

01:54.548 --> 01:55.716
Yes.

01:55.749 --> 01:57.418
What do you guys want from me?

01:58.519 --> 01:59.587
Stand down.

02:00.288 --> 02:01.522
It's okay.

02:03.624 --> 02:05.159
Do you...

02:06.394 --> 02:08.696
You don't know
why we're here, do you?

02:08.729 --> 02:10.898
No. What's going on here?

02:10.931 --> 02:13.234
Supergirl, please, don't...

02:14.735 --> 02:16.570
Don't let them hurt me.

02:16.604 --> 02:18.172
Please.

02:19.473 --> 02:21.542
No, no. Don't worry. I won't.

02:23.277 --> 02:25.313
-Don't move!
-Whoa! Whoa! Hey!

02:25.346 --> 02:26.947
You stay right there.

02:26.980 --> 02:28.816
Let's get her
back to the DEO.
We can talk--

02:28.849 --> 02:30.384
-Hold on. It'll be all right.
-I said, stay still.

02:30.418 --> 02:31.452
No, no, no. Wait!

03:10.891 --> 03:12.360
J'onn.

03:27.408 --> 03:28.642
That could have been worse.

03:40.388 --> 03:43.424
Met your KPIs,
and you're still
under-performing.

03:44.057 --> 03:45.526
I'll call you back.

03:46.327 --> 03:48.028
-Hey.
-Hey.

03:48.061 --> 03:50.398
-Nothing.

03:50.431 --> 03:51.765
Is everything okay?

03:51.799 --> 03:53.401
Yeah. TYK Labs branch,

03:53.434 --> 03:55.403
I'm gonna have to replace
a few people there.

03:55.436 --> 03:57.305
Oh, I can handle that.

03:57.338 --> 03:58.672
I've been away from L-Corp
too long.

03:58.706 --> 04:00.374
I'm looking forward
to getting back in

04:00.408 --> 04:03.043
and getting my hands
a little dirty again.

04:03.076 --> 04:05.946
Sam, this has nothing
to do with the way
things have been running,

04:05.979 --> 04:07.448
believe me.

04:07.481 --> 04:09.283
But it's because
I'm sick, though.

04:10.918 --> 04:13.287
You don't think
I'm up for the job anymore?

04:14.622 --> 04:17.591
Sam, do you remember
when we first met?

04:17.625 --> 04:22.062
It was three o'clock
in the morning. We'd just
acquired your company,

04:22.095 --> 04:24.064
and I was in charge
of the takeover.

04:24.097 --> 04:28.068
You were a junior VP,
and your light was
the only one on in the office.

04:28.101 --> 04:32.640
I walked by,
and I saw your head
down over spreadsheets.

04:32.673 --> 04:35.476
Cross analysis report.
God, I was good at those.

04:35.509 --> 04:37.411
You were so focused.

04:37.445 --> 04:41.782
And I thought,
"Her. I wanna work with her."

04:41.815 --> 04:43.784
Everyone knows
how good you are at your job,

04:43.817 --> 04:46.920
Sam, you don't have
to keep on proving it.

04:46.954 --> 04:49.089
With everything that
you're dealing with
in your life right now,

04:49.122 --> 04:51.759
I just wanna give you
as little stress as possible.

04:52.893 --> 04:55.028
Lena, I can't take
time off right now.

04:55.062 --> 04:57.631
Yeah, you can.

04:57.665 --> 04:59.733
In fact, I am ordering you
to take today off.

04:59.767 --> 05:01.735
There is nothing here
I can't handle,

05:01.769 --> 05:05.506
so go. Be with your daughter.

05:08.909 --> 05:12.480
Purity is down,
Reign and Pestilence to go.

05:12.513 --> 05:13.981
And it is only a Wednesday.

05:14.014 --> 05:16.016
It's certainly been
a good morning so far.

05:16.049 --> 05:17.651
Yes, and bonus points,

05:17.685 --> 05:20.087
the DEO techs found this
at the Worldkiller's home.

05:20.120 --> 05:22.856
It is a Kryptonian
cache crystal,

05:22.890 --> 05:25.393
as you know, used to store
sensitive information.

05:25.426 --> 05:28.061
I've seen crystals like this
in the Fortress of Solitude.

05:28.095 --> 05:30.631
They contain elements
of the Fortress itself,

05:30.664 --> 05:32.600
sort of like
an artist's stamp.

05:32.633 --> 05:35.903
Yes, but this crystal has
a very different home,
very different stamp.

05:35.936 --> 05:37.738
We might be able
to pinpoint the location

05:37.771 --> 05:39.840
of the Worldkillers'
headquarters if we analyze it.

05:40.674 --> 05:42.009
First round is on me.

05:42.042 --> 05:43.644
Winn, get your chicken wings.

05:43.677 --> 05:45.646
And I will have an unnecessary
amount of chicken wings,

05:45.679 --> 05:47.548
as befits a man of my stature.

05:49.950 --> 05:51.151
Hey, are you okay?

05:51.184 --> 05:54.888
You took a couple of serious
blows back there at the house.

05:54.922 --> 05:57.057
Oh, hey, you know what?
I analyzed the frequency

05:57.090 --> 06:00.060
of the Worldkillers'
vibrations when I was
in the van.

06:00.093 --> 06:05.399
Turns out, it is tuned
specifically to hurt
Kryptonians.

06:05.433 --> 06:09.102
Luckily, the inhibitors
in the cell seem to be
working on her.

06:09.136 --> 06:11.572
Yeah, you do seem a bit off.

06:11.605 --> 06:13.841
Maybe we should
run some tests.

06:13.874 --> 06:15.142
Guys?

06:15.175 --> 06:16.844
-Yeah, sure.
We'll leave you to it.
-Thanks.

06:18.946 --> 06:21.114
Break.

06:21.148 --> 06:23.751
It's not the sonic blast
that's bothering me.

06:25.519 --> 06:27.921
Hey, J'onn, by the way,
I need your help
with something.

06:27.955 --> 06:29.122
Yeah

06:29.156 --> 06:31.525
Well, you know that our Legion
ship is the only way home.

06:31.559 --> 06:34.094
And in about a day,
we're gonna lose
the ability to fly.

06:34.127 --> 06:35.696
Is there some way to fix it?

06:35.729 --> 06:37.565
Yeah, and I think
the part might be
in your ship.

06:37.598 --> 06:39.833
Whoa. Whoa. You guys
are doing spaceship repair?

06:39.867 --> 06:41.702
'Cause I need to see that.

06:41.735 --> 06:43.771
-You're busy.
-Oh, come on.

06:43.804 --> 06:46.707
The decoder, it's doing
its thing. It's gonna take,
like, five hours.

06:46.740 --> 06:48.509
Fine. But you're
coming back here

06:48.542 --> 06:49.843
the second there's
a breakthrough
with that crystal.

06:49.877 --> 06:50.878
Yes!

06:52.012 --> 06:55.849
That woman was scared
before her eyes turned white.

06:55.883 --> 06:59.953
She looked me in the eye,
and she asked me for help.

06:59.987 --> 07:03.023
It's like someone else
took over her.

07:03.056 --> 07:05.726
Due respect,
but what I saw in that house

07:05.759 --> 07:07.961
was a very capable liar
putting on an act

07:07.995 --> 07:09.863
so she can get close enough
to kill you.

07:09.897 --> 07:12.833
No. No,
I don't think she's faking it.

07:12.866 --> 07:15.235
You told me
about the vision you had.

07:15.268 --> 07:17.738
The world was burning.

07:17.771 --> 07:19.740
That is the Worldkiller
that you saw.

07:19.773 --> 07:22.576
Yes, but what if
there's a part of her
that isn't?

07:22.610 --> 07:25.012
If I can get her
to be Julia again,

07:25.045 --> 07:28.248
doesn't that mean that there's
someone we can work with?

07:28.281 --> 07:29.750
This?

07:29.783 --> 07:31.852
This isn't
telling us anything.

07:31.885 --> 07:33.587
Julia might.

07:33.621 --> 07:35.756
-We can try it your way.
-Thank you.

07:35.789 --> 07:38.859
And when your way fails,
we try it mine.

07:51.004 --> 07:53.641
Hi, Julia.

07:53.674 --> 07:56.677
You seemed really scared
at your house earlier,

07:56.710 --> 07:59.580
and I totally understand that.

07:59.613 --> 08:01.048
And I'm here to help you.

08:04.685 --> 08:07.054
-Julia.
-That's not my name.

08:07.087 --> 08:10.090
Okay. What would you
like me to call you?

08:10.123 --> 08:13.727
I am the scalding light.

08:13.761 --> 08:16.830
I am the flood
that sweeps away sins.

08:16.864 --> 08:19.833
I am the word
and cry of justice.

08:19.867 --> 08:22.002
Yeah, would you mind just
condensing that a little bit?

08:22.035 --> 08:24.171
-Alex. Just... Alex.
-Well, it's long.

08:24.204 --> 08:25.873
Hey, hey.

08:25.906 --> 08:27.775
Uh, you were about
to tell me your name.

08:27.808 --> 08:30.110
I'd really like to hear
what you have to say.

08:30.143 --> 08:31.845
I am Purity.

08:31.879 --> 08:34.715
Nice to meet you, Purity.

08:34.748 --> 08:37.217
I'm gonna call you Julia,
though. Is that okay?

08:37.250 --> 08:38.986
Just, I met her first,

08:39.019 --> 08:42.255
and she's who I'd really like
to talk to, actually.

08:42.289 --> 08:43.891
Hmm.

08:44.792 --> 08:46.760
Call me what you will,

08:46.794 --> 08:48.696
Kryptonian.

08:48.729 --> 08:50.731
They don't understand yet.

08:52.032 --> 08:53.100
You do.

08:54.101 --> 08:55.936
Me?

08:55.969 --> 08:57.671
Yeah.

08:57.705 --> 08:59.773
Yeah, I do.
I understand it just fine.

09:01.208 --> 09:02.776
-Alex...

09:02.810 --> 09:05.245
See, I know that look.

09:05.278 --> 09:07.815
You think
that you're smarter than me,

09:07.848 --> 09:10.217
that you're stronger than me,

09:10.250 --> 09:13.721
which is fine. I mean,
you're entitled
to your own opinion.

09:13.754 --> 09:16.089
It'll change in time, though.

09:16.123 --> 09:18.726
Because, after days,

09:18.759 --> 09:21.194
weeks, months

09:22.630 --> 09:24.097
in here,

09:24.131 --> 09:26.800
you're gonna feel
like I peeled your skin off

09:26.834 --> 09:28.969
and saw everything underneath.

09:30.070 --> 09:33.674
You can call me
"Agent Danvers," Purity.

09:34.307 --> 09:36.276
Julia,

09:36.309 --> 09:37.945
I know you're in there.

09:39.146 --> 09:43.951
If you can show yourself,
I will help you.

09:43.984 --> 09:45.352
Or you can
just tell us where Reign is.

09:45.385 --> 09:47.020
I mean, that's why
we brought you in here,

09:47.054 --> 09:49.322
which was super easy,
by the way.

09:49.356 --> 09:52.726
Oh, ladies.

09:52.760 --> 09:55.228
How will you ever
make your minds up about me?

10:04.371 --> 10:05.906
Okay, ice skating?

10:05.939 --> 10:07.875
Uh, it's a mental
health holiday.

10:07.908 --> 10:09.209
Is everything okay?

10:09.242 --> 10:11.078
Yeah. Of course.

10:11.111 --> 10:13.080
I just miss seeing you, babe.

10:13.113 --> 10:14.782
I mean, it's been
a rough couple months,

10:14.815 --> 10:17.885
I feel like we can both
play a little hooky.

10:17.918 --> 10:19.653
Oh, my God,
you're being serious.

10:19.687 --> 10:21.655
I'm serious.
Sound like a plan?

10:21.689 --> 10:23.323
Hell, yeah.

10:23.356 --> 10:26.259
You get precisely one
"hell, yes" today.
I hope you enjoyed that.

10:26.293 --> 10:27.828
Okay.

10:29.797 --> 10:33.901
A Bel Air... Oh!
Your ship is a Bel Air?

10:33.934 --> 10:37.304
Indeed. Two four-barrel
carburetors, Duntov cam...

10:37.337 --> 10:39.339
-About 700 million.

10:39.372 --> 10:41.308
I didn't know
you knew about cars, Winn.

10:41.341 --> 10:42.976
Oh, please. If you can
take it apart and put it
back together,

10:43.010 --> 10:44.311
you better believe
I know about it.

10:44.344 --> 10:46.780
Ooh! Yeah.
"Look, don't touch." Got it.

10:46.814 --> 10:48.315
Why did you want
to see my ship?

10:48.348 --> 10:51.218
Well, the Moran battery
in our cruiser died last week.

10:51.251 --> 10:53.053
Wait, your ship
doesn't have any power?

10:53.086 --> 10:55.455
Well, not entirely.
There's five power sources.

10:55.488 --> 10:58.726
But a Moran battery generates
anti-gravitational field.

10:58.759 --> 11:00.393
Which is how the ship flies.

11:00.427 --> 11:02.863
But if the circuits
are without power
long enough, they degrade.

11:02.896 --> 11:04.397
And turn into
a pumpkin. Got it.

11:04.431 --> 11:07.000
So the only way to save it
is if we use the Moran battery

11:07.034 --> 11:10.270
from your ship to regenerate
the fuel cells in ours.

11:10.303 --> 11:12.005
Oh. So you need a jump?

11:12.039 --> 11:13.473
-Yeah.
-Easy.

11:13.506 --> 11:14.975
Ooh!

11:15.776 --> 11:17.310
Oh-ho-ho-ho!

11:17.344 --> 11:20.247
Now that battery looks like it
packs a punch. Can I hold it?

11:20.280 --> 11:22.049
-No.
-Okay.

11:22.082 --> 11:25.385
Julia Freeman.
No birth certificate,

11:25.418 --> 11:30.157
adopted in 1993
by Lawrence and Molly Freeman.

11:30.190 --> 11:33.226
Let's see what it says.

11:33.260 --> 11:35.195
Allergic to milk.

11:35.228 --> 11:38.465
Studied music at
the Cincinnati Conservatory.

11:38.498 --> 11:41.434
Doesn't Julia sound nice?

11:41.468 --> 11:43.503
Yeah.

11:43.536 --> 11:49.109
Yeah, from the little
I've been around her,
I liked her.

11:50.010 --> 11:51.845
She was very fun to play.

11:51.879 --> 11:58.018
Everything you have
in that file is just
a character description.

11:58.051 --> 12:01.488
There never was,
and never will be,

12:01.521 --> 12:03.891
a Julia Freeman.

12:03.924 --> 12:06.159
Just little old me.

12:06.193 --> 12:09.496
But why keep up an act
for a decade?

12:09.529 --> 12:11.832
When my sistren and I arrived,

12:11.865 --> 12:15.535
we knew it would be many years

12:15.568 --> 12:21.775
before the cosmic alignment
of forces came to pass.

12:21.809 --> 12:24.011
Masks would be necessary.

12:32.052 --> 12:35.522
Vinita Ripson,
your roommate at Cincinnati,

12:35.555 --> 12:39.827
your emergency contact,
your best friend
for a decade...

12:39.860 --> 12:42.329
I bet she's really worried
about you right now.

12:45.165 --> 12:47.000
Sounds about right.

12:47.034 --> 12:50.303
Vinita was always so clingy.

12:50.337 --> 12:51.972
It drove me crazy.

12:52.005 --> 12:54.041
Crazy enough to save her life?

12:57.945 --> 12:59.346
Julia?

13:07.020 --> 13:10.490
You imagine I care
about humans
just because you do?

13:10.523 --> 13:14.327
I think you do care, Julia.
And I care about you.

13:15.095 --> 13:16.563
Hmm.

13:16.596 --> 13:22.102
Will you care
when I tear open your bones

13:22.135 --> 13:25.172
and rip out your soft parts?

13:25.205 --> 13:27.140
You're never gonna
get that chance

13:27.174 --> 13:31.044
because you are gonna sit
in that cell until I say so.

13:31.078 --> 13:34.882
And after,
I'll open up your friend

13:34.915 --> 13:38.151
and eat her heart
with the other gods.

13:38.185 --> 13:40.087
You want to talk
about insides?

13:40.120 --> 13:42.622
'Cause you are gonna
have eight different
government agencies

13:42.655 --> 13:44.925
fighting over
who's going to dissect you.

13:44.958 --> 13:47.427
All right,
let's speak outside,
Agent Danvers.

13:47.460 --> 13:50.197
You're not a god.
You're just meat and bones.

13:50.230 --> 13:51.364
Alex!

13:54.234 --> 13:56.469
Alex?

13:56.503 --> 13:58.438
Why are you fighting me
so hard on this?

13:58.471 --> 14:01.341
You realize that
Purity is just toying
with you, right?

14:01.374 --> 14:04.044
If we have the chance to save
Julia, we have to take it.

14:04.077 --> 14:08.348
That is such
a nice motto, Kara,
but it's not very practical.

14:08.381 --> 14:09.749
Excuse me?

14:09.782 --> 14:13.353
No matter how much evidence
piles up saying
that you are wrong,

14:13.386 --> 14:14.587
you always hope.

14:14.621 --> 14:16.056
That's my job.

14:16.089 --> 14:19.226
Purity is evil.
She is a Worldkiller.

14:19.259 --> 14:23.363
And there's two others
out there just like her,
endangering lives,

14:23.396 --> 14:25.933
and your feelings
are costing us time.

14:25.966 --> 14:29.636
Okay, my feelings
have saved lives

14:29.669 --> 14:31.171
countless times.

14:31.204 --> 14:33.406
Alex... Wait. Listen to me.

14:33.440 --> 14:35.442
I am used to you
being pragmatic,

14:35.475 --> 14:38.511
but since when have you become
so hard and cynical?

14:38.545 --> 14:40.948
Well, not all of us
are bulletproof, Kara.

14:40.981 --> 14:42.615
I know.

14:42.649 --> 14:46.586
So, cynicism, that's what's
keeping the rest of us alive.

14:46.619 --> 14:48.989
Well, it seems like
it's killing you.

14:49.022 --> 14:52.292
My sister, the sister I know,
she has compassion for others.

14:52.325 --> 14:55.595
I am just trying to do my job.

14:55.628 --> 14:59.066
Now, we've tried it
your way, we did.

14:59.099 --> 15:01.068
But now we're gonna
do it mine.

15:08.708 --> 15:11.111
Okay, try it now.

15:14.614 --> 15:17.717
Um, you know, is there like
a user manual

15:17.750 --> 15:20.620
or something that
we can take
a look at for ideas?

15:22.389 --> 15:23.290
Sprock!

15:23.323 --> 15:25.959
I gather
it's not going too well.

15:25.993 --> 15:29.129
Uh, not at presently,
but we will get there.

15:31.564 --> 15:34.034
Brainy and I took a look
into that Thysteria rock,

15:34.067 --> 15:35.602
but it was a dead end.

15:35.635 --> 15:37.404
Did you get
the battery working?

15:37.437 --> 15:39.439
No, but I'm handling it.

15:39.472 --> 15:41.641
Okay. Did you try
recalibrating it?

15:43.376 --> 15:45.345
Yes, Imra, I'm handling it.

15:45.378 --> 15:47.714
Okay, look, I may not be
a twelfth-level intellect,

15:47.747 --> 15:49.716
Mon-El, but I'm sharp.

15:49.749 --> 15:51.351
And as I said last night,

15:51.384 --> 15:53.586
there's no need
of telling me anything twice.

15:53.620 --> 15:55.488
Ever.

15:55.522 --> 15:57.657
Imra, please don't do this.

15:57.690 --> 16:01.394
I'm just doing
exactly what you told me
when I joined the Legion.

16:01.428 --> 16:03.296
I'm just speaking the truth.

16:05.798 --> 16:08.501
Uh, I'm... I've got
to check on the crystal.

16:08.535 --> 16:11.238
-Yeah. Yeah,
I'll be right there.
-Thanks.

16:16.109 --> 16:17.677
You still wanna
carry on working?

16:19.312 --> 16:20.680
There's no point.

16:27.654 --> 16:29.256
Where is Reign?

16:31.658 --> 16:34.294
We have the Kryptonian crystal
from your apartment,

16:34.327 --> 16:37.530
and we know that
it's gonna lead
to your headquarters.

16:37.564 --> 16:39.166
Where is Reign?

16:42.669 --> 16:45.238
You're not so chatty now,
are you?

16:45.772 --> 16:47.407
That makes sense.

16:47.440 --> 16:49.509
Because I'm not your audience.

16:49.542 --> 16:53.513
I'm just looking
at a bug under glass.

16:59.419 --> 17:02.089
To use
your own words,

17:02.122 --> 17:04.591
you think you're
smarter than me,

17:04.624 --> 17:06.726
stronger than me.

17:06.759 --> 17:10.330
You think I'm powerless
to your science.

17:12.432 --> 17:15.735
I see right through you,
Alex Danvers.

17:17.170 --> 17:19.506
It's a gift I have,

17:19.539 --> 17:21.608
to see inside people...

17:22.375 --> 17:23.643
To know them.

17:28.281 --> 17:30.450
You want to hurt me

17:30.483 --> 17:33.253
because you're hurt.

17:34.387 --> 17:36.856
You want me weak,

17:36.889 --> 17:39.859
because you're weak.

17:39.892 --> 17:46.199
Someone cut something
out of you, and you feel
the hole every day.

17:46.233 --> 17:49.802
A hole that you dug
in yourself.

17:51.871 --> 17:53.773
And it's not getting
any better now, is it?

17:53.806 --> 17:57.144
Okay. All right, all right.
We're done here.

17:59.812 --> 18:01.648
See the rage?

18:01.681 --> 18:03.416
That's your loneliness.

18:03.450 --> 18:05.318
-Shut your mouth!
-Let's go.

18:05.352 --> 18:08.755
You had your chance
at happiness,
and you threw it away.

18:08.788 --> 18:09.756
Alex.

18:09.789 --> 18:13.626
And now you're just
a broken little doll.

18:13.660 --> 18:15.428
Alex, wait.

18:20.467 --> 18:22.535
She was right about you.

18:22.569 --> 18:25.672
You're just a thing
built to destroy.

18:25.705 --> 18:28.541
And I'm gonna make sure
you don't hurt anyone else.

18:28.575 --> 18:30.243
All right,
you ready for this?

18:30.277 --> 18:33.146
I'm young and reckless.
I've got this in the bag.

18:33.180 --> 18:34.581
-Three.
-Two...

18:34.614 --> 18:36.783
Okay, cheating
will get you nowhere!

18:40.753 --> 18:42.522
Okay.

18:45.592 --> 18:47.427
Really, nothing? Come on.

18:52.465 --> 18:54.634
-Hey.

18:56.303 --> 18:57.670
What happened?

19:02.309 --> 19:03.843
I'm good, okay?

19:03.876 --> 19:06.579
Alex? Hey! You--

19:07.814 --> 19:09.582
Damn it.

19:13.320 --> 19:15.355
Now, who turned you on?

19:40.413 --> 19:42.682
Ah! Beginner!

19:49.689 --> 19:50.923
Beat you!

19:53.793 --> 19:54.894
Mom?

19:55.728 --> 19:56.729
Mom?

21:02.395 --> 21:04.263
Contact! Contact!

21:26.619 --> 21:28.521
I thought you left.

21:28.555 --> 21:31.758
I did, but, uh,
only to get these.

21:32.058 --> 21:33.526
Come on.

21:37.129 --> 21:40.800
It's sort of
a Martian moonshine.

21:40.833 --> 21:42.502
It's kind of spicy.

21:42.535 --> 21:45.071
It has a
consciousness-enhancing
quality to it.

21:45.104 --> 21:46.873
This has a label.

21:46.906 --> 21:49.108
Oh, yeah. They sell it
in the alien bars.
Doing quite well.

21:51.077 --> 21:52.645
Cheers.

21:54.714 --> 21:57.417
You know, I, um...

21:57.450 --> 22:01.821
It's been
a couple of centuries,
but I was once married.

22:02.822 --> 22:05.425
Seventy-seven years, in fact.

22:05.458 --> 22:09.028
So I'm quite familiar
with the marital spat.

22:09.061 --> 22:11.998
Yeah, it's, uh,
it's not what you think.

22:12.031 --> 22:14.767
It might help
to talk about it.

22:14.801 --> 22:17.970
Yeah, thanks, but, um,
but I don't think so.

22:20.973 --> 22:26.513
You keep a lot of secrets,
young man.

22:26.546 --> 22:29.949
Usually, they're
to protect others,
so your intentions are good,

22:29.982 --> 22:32.585
but it really might help
if you share the load.

22:35.955 --> 22:41.093
Well, Imra and I
have a complicated history.

22:41.127 --> 22:42.895
Hmm.

22:42.929 --> 22:45.765
We didn't exactly choose
to get married to one another.

22:48.000 --> 22:51.471
So she's from this
important family on Titan.

22:51.504 --> 22:53.840
And Titan was the head
of this faction of planets

22:53.873 --> 22:57.710
that were very against
Earth and its allies.

22:57.744 --> 23:02.482
So, in the early days
of the Legion, we needed
to do something symbolic.

23:02.515 --> 23:04.917
You know, to show
that we represented everyone.

23:04.951 --> 23:07.487
You united the planets
when you got married?

23:07.520 --> 23:10.423
-There it is.
-Wow.

23:10.457 --> 23:12.058
And I was still mourning Kara.

23:13.793 --> 23:16.763
Imra and I were
friends and partners,

23:16.796 --> 23:18.765
and I was fond of her.
I respected her.

23:21.233 --> 23:25.071
But I knew that marrying Imra
would help so many.

23:25.104 --> 23:28.575
It just seemed
like the logical thing to do.

23:28.608 --> 23:31.177
And then, with time,
I mean, I...

23:31.210 --> 23:34.681
Our pretend marriage
became more real
and our feelings deepened,

23:34.714 --> 23:38.585
and I grew to love her.

23:38.618 --> 23:40.052
I was content.

23:42.922 --> 23:44.924
But with Kara, I mean...

23:48.294 --> 23:52.899
There was nothing logical
about falling in love
with Kara.

23:52.932 --> 23:58.538
I mean, she was...
She was a Kryptonian elitist,

23:58.571 --> 24:02.675
and I was this completely
self-absorbed misogynist.

24:03.142 --> 24:04.176
Not anymore.

24:05.945 --> 24:08.014
But what I felt for her,

24:08.748 --> 24:10.917
it was... It was just...

24:16.623 --> 24:18.858
Being back here is, um...

24:21.761 --> 24:24.163
I've had to keep
a distance from Kara

24:24.196 --> 24:27.466
because, whenever
I'm around her, these old
feelings get stirred up.

24:29.902 --> 24:33.806
And then I have
to hide it from Imra.

24:33.840 --> 24:37.176
But lately, there's just been
all this friction between us
'cause of...

24:40.279 --> 24:43.049
I know it's my fault,
and I just...

24:46.886 --> 24:49.522
I don't know what to do.

24:49.556 --> 24:55.294
You know, if you think
keeping secrets
from your wife is hard,

24:55.327 --> 24:58.097
you should try keeping
secrets from a Martian.

25:00.032 --> 25:02.234
My wife and I would, uh...

25:02.268 --> 25:06.205
Would bond and literally share
our thoughts and feelings
every night.

25:08.107 --> 25:10.209
Marriage is sharing, Mon-El.

25:11.177 --> 25:13.646
Everything.

25:13.680 --> 25:17.784
You are not a criminal because
you have complicated feelings.

25:18.918 --> 25:21.921
If you truly love
and honor Imra,

25:23.189 --> 25:25.124
maybe you should let her in.

25:34.233 --> 25:35.735
What is it?

25:35.768 --> 25:37.069
Purity.

25:41.808 --> 25:43.342
Ruby?

25:43.375 --> 25:45.344
Ruby.

25:45.377 --> 25:48.014
-I'm fine.

25:48.047 --> 25:50.049
Sweetheart, what happened?

25:50.082 --> 25:52.919
I turned around,
and she was gone.

25:54.821 --> 25:57.857
Honey, I'm so sorry.
Your mom's just...

25:57.890 --> 25:59.592
She's going through a lot.

25:59.626 --> 26:00.927
It's gonna be okay.

26:02.228 --> 26:04.597
This is not okay.

26:04.631 --> 26:07.767
She was so excited
to hang out today.

26:07.800 --> 26:10.036
And then she just disappeared.

26:10.069 --> 26:11.938
It's like, a few months ago,

26:11.971 --> 26:14.073
she was planning
on going on this big trip,

26:14.106 --> 26:16.342
and something wonderful
was gonna happen.

26:16.375 --> 26:20.647
And when she got back,
she acted like
she hadn't been anywhere.

26:20.680 --> 26:22.081
She didn't remember?

26:22.114 --> 26:24.684
There's something wrong.

26:24.717 --> 26:28.721
I don't know what,
but there's something.

26:28.755 --> 26:32.158
It's like, sometimes,
she's a completely
different person.

26:36.095 --> 26:38.230
Ruby, I know it's scary,

26:38.264 --> 26:39.398
okay?

26:39.431 --> 26:41.367
But something
you've got to know
about me is that,

26:41.400 --> 26:43.836
when there's a problem,
I always find an answer.

26:43.870 --> 26:45.237
Okay?

26:49.408 --> 26:50.777
You've found her?

26:50.810 --> 26:53.245
Yes, indeed.
Hey, perfect timing.

26:53.279 --> 26:55.247
-She is in the subway,

26:55.281 --> 26:58.017
though there have been
no reports of any attacks yet.

26:58.050 --> 27:00.019
There will be soon, though.

27:00.052 --> 27:01.120
We should head out.

27:01.153 --> 27:02.955
Same team as before, right?

27:02.989 --> 27:06.025
Well, if, uh, if you can come,
we could use you.

27:06.058 --> 27:08.127
Yeah. Absolutely.

27:10.396 --> 27:12.131
I'm not underestimating
her again.

27:12.164 --> 27:14.166
-Ever.
-Uh, speaking of...

27:14.200 --> 27:15.702
Presents.

27:15.735 --> 27:17.670
I have revamped
some old sonic technology

27:17.704 --> 27:20.807
to cut out the frequency
that she hit you with before.

27:20.840 --> 27:22.208
Yeah, but will they work?

27:23.976 --> 27:25.244
Wait, you really
asked me that?

27:25.277 --> 27:29.215
Uh, it's like 95% sure.

27:29.248 --> 27:31.183
-Good work, Agent Schott.
Anytime.

27:31.217 --> 27:33.953
Now, go do superheroic stuff.

27:33.986 --> 27:35.287
Let's go.

27:45.832 --> 27:48.968
Someone else has found
one of your partners.

27:51.037 --> 27:52.739
How do you know?

27:52.772 --> 27:56.743
She possesses a crystal like
yours that has been activated.

27:56.776 --> 28:00.046
She's awakening,
and you must guide her.

28:00.947 --> 28:03.482
But be wise in your tactics.

28:03.515 --> 28:05.217
She's a newborn.

28:05.251 --> 28:08.487
Delicate, malleable.

28:08.520 --> 28:12.291
You must bring her here,
home, before they
take her away.

28:13.059 --> 28:14.727
I understand.

28:42.822 --> 28:44.957
Yo, kiddo, you all right?

28:54.000 --> 28:55.401
Purity?

28:55.434 --> 28:58.204
You've finally
learned my name.

30:16.648 --> 30:18.550
-Alex.
-On it.

30:23.655 --> 30:25.191
Everybody, out.

30:25.224 --> 30:26.625
Hey. It's all right.
Get up. Up, up, up.

30:26.658 --> 30:28.494
Everybody, get out! Out!

30:28.527 --> 30:30.362
Go!

30:30.396 --> 30:32.164
We've got to get
these people out of here.

30:32.198 --> 30:33.432
Go. I've got this.

30:33.465 --> 30:35.167
-Yes. Go!

30:56.055 --> 30:57.323
Purity.

31:14.340 --> 31:17.209
I got you. Now go.
Go! Go.

31:22.248 --> 31:24.083
I'll tell you a secret.

31:24.116 --> 31:28.254
Julia's here, and I'm going to
make her watch...

31:28.287 --> 31:30.622
-No! No.
-...while I kill you.

31:30.656 --> 31:34.961
No, Julia. Julia, please.
Please don't let her hurt me.

31:38.497 --> 31:40.432
Julia, I know you're there.

31:44.203 --> 31:46.605
Julia. No, no, no, Julia.

31:46.638 --> 31:48.240
Julia...

31:50.009 --> 31:53.212
You stood in front of a car
to save your friend Vinita

31:53.245 --> 31:55.647
because you love your friend.

31:55.681 --> 31:59.251
And you know that
Supergirl wants to help you.

31:59.285 --> 32:01.087
You can fight this,

32:01.120 --> 32:05.124
because you...
You are stronger
than you think.

32:05.157 --> 32:09.428
I know that you can hear me,
Julia. I see you in there.

32:09.461 --> 32:12.198
And I am so sorry
that I didn't see it before.

32:12.231 --> 32:15.101
But I swear to God,
I am gonna help you beat this.

32:15.134 --> 32:16.502
We all will.

32:17.403 --> 32:19.038
But you have to fight.

32:22.108 --> 32:24.176
No! No!

32:24.210 --> 32:25.477
Julia...

32:39.425 --> 32:41.560
So the Supergirl kneels.

32:42.361 --> 32:44.030
Good practice.

32:46.432 --> 32:49.301
Alex? Alex. No.

32:49.335 --> 32:51.403
You, I'll kill.

32:53.072 --> 32:55.007
No!

32:55.041 --> 32:57.076
-No!

32:57.109 --> 32:58.444
Stop.

33:08.054 --> 33:09.488
Take me.

33:11.057 --> 33:14.393
-You can have me.
-Julia, don't. Don't do this.

33:19.298 --> 33:22.301
Purity, sister.

33:22.334 --> 33:24.303
We will find our third,

33:24.336 --> 33:26.472
our Pestilence.

33:26.505 --> 33:28.107
Once we're finally together,

33:28.140 --> 33:31.543
there will be nothing
but unstoppable power.

33:50.429 --> 33:52.231
A couple
of bruised ribs

33:52.264 --> 33:55.467
and what feels like
a giant hematoma on my ass.

33:55.501 --> 33:56.635
But it could have been worse.

33:56.668 --> 33:58.770
It could have been rugby.

33:58.804 --> 34:00.539
Alex, you could have
been killed.

34:00.572 --> 34:02.374
-Don't joke.
-Calm down.

34:02.408 --> 34:04.510
Winn, please give them
something else to think about.

34:04.543 --> 34:09.348
Uh, we lost track of Reign
and Julia, like, minutes
after they flew away.

34:09.381 --> 34:12.284
It's only a matter of time
before Reign forces Julia
back into Purity.

34:12.318 --> 34:15.654
Julia, she's tough.
Maybe she can hold out.

34:15.687 --> 34:19.725
Wow, the Worldkillers might be
too hard for us to beat.

34:19.758 --> 34:22.394
But maybe we're not
supposed to beat them.

34:22.428 --> 34:24.696
Well, how are we
supposed to win?

34:25.564 --> 34:27.065
We save them.

34:31.303 --> 34:33.071
You don't need to be afraid.

34:35.674 --> 34:37.209
Let me out of here.

34:37.876 --> 34:39.445
-Stop.

34:44.783 --> 34:48.086
Your awakening has begun,
my child.

34:51.490 --> 34:53.225
I don't...

34:53.259 --> 34:55.461
I don't want it!

34:59.865 --> 35:01.667
Winn, hey,
I heard you fixed it.

35:01.700 --> 35:04.803
-How did you---
-I mean... I assisted.

35:04.836 --> 35:07.173
That was a little more
than an assist.

35:07.206 --> 35:08.607
He researched Moran math.

35:08.640 --> 35:10.576
They currently run their
entire measurement system

35:10.609 --> 35:12.611
on a scale of 12
instead of 10.

35:12.644 --> 35:14.680
Yeah, sort of how, in America,
we use inches
instead of the metric system.

35:14.713 --> 35:18.150
They must have switched over
before this here battery
was invented,

35:18.184 --> 35:21.653
which, actually, you know,
gives me hope for America.

35:21.687 --> 35:23.855
So we were overloading
the fuel cells.

35:23.889 --> 35:25.591
-Bingo.
-Thanks, Winn.

35:25.624 --> 35:27.193
I mean, if you really
wanna thank me,

35:27.226 --> 35:30.529
you could let me take
this out for a test drive.

35:30.562 --> 35:31.763
Just saying.

35:36.635 --> 35:40.272
I'm sorry you lost
the Worldkiller.

35:40.306 --> 35:44.510
But I... You didn't think
to call me about the fight?

35:45.244 --> 35:46.512
I know.

35:48.914 --> 35:50.316
I, uh...

35:53.219 --> 35:54.853
I'm sorry for the way
that I've been acting.

35:57.389 --> 35:58.590
It's just...

35:59.458 --> 36:01.593
Being back here, it's...

36:02.928 --> 36:04.930
It's been
very confusing for me.

36:04.963 --> 36:07.299
You don't think
I already know that?

36:07.333 --> 36:10.336
I mean, that fight last night,
Mon-El, was so stupid.

36:10.369 --> 36:11.837
What, about the Legion manual?

36:11.870 --> 36:14.240
You think I'm bothered
that you misplaced the manual?

36:16.675 --> 36:18.610
I was upset before that.

36:19.878 --> 36:22.681
We were sitting in the DEO.

36:22.714 --> 36:24.750
Supergirl was talking
about Reign...

36:26.885 --> 36:29.655
And you got this look
in your eye,

36:29.688 --> 36:32.324
one that I know so well.

36:32.358 --> 36:35.561
You had the same look
the first time you told me
you loved me.

36:37.896 --> 36:42.401
Spending time
with Kara again has, um,

36:42.434 --> 36:44.803
been more difficult
than I could have imagined.

36:46.838 --> 36:48.674
Are you still
in love with her?

36:54.646 --> 36:55.914
I don't know.

37:01.653 --> 37:03.221
Thank you for being honest.

37:05.056 --> 37:07.993
It's why I fell in love
with you in the first point.

37:08.026 --> 37:11.863
Imra, I swear to you
that I will always
be honest to you.

37:11.897 --> 37:16.001
Okay? I respect and love you.

37:16.034 --> 37:18.904
This is more difficult
than anything I could
have fathomed.

37:20.038 --> 37:22.374
But we will
work through it, okay?

37:23.475 --> 37:24.810
Mon-El, I'm...

37:26.545 --> 37:31.517
I haven't been
completely honest with you.

37:31.550 --> 37:34.853
I always knew there was
a risk when Brainy and I
planned this mission.

37:35.687 --> 37:37.756
What mission?

37:37.789 --> 37:38.990
It's time for me
to tell you the truth

37:39.024 --> 37:40.826
about why we're really here.

37:44.730 --> 37:47.899
Okay. Start with this.

37:47.933 --> 37:50.502
And then I'll try
to talk you out of tequila.

37:50.536 --> 37:52.971
Hmm. There's a bold move.

37:55.106 --> 37:56.675
Are we okay?

37:57.376 --> 37:58.243
We are okay.

37:58.276 --> 38:00.312
Do you wanna tell me
what's going on?

38:02.481 --> 38:04.816
I just thought
that it would get easier.

38:06.518 --> 38:08.053
But it's not.

38:08.086 --> 38:10.356
Alex.

38:10.389 --> 38:12.324
You know, I have...

38:12.358 --> 38:14.693
I have two speed dials
on this phone.

38:15.093 --> 38:16.395
It's you

38:17.095 --> 38:18.564
and Maggie.

38:18.597 --> 38:21.099
And every day,
every single day,

38:21.132 --> 38:24.436
I look at this phone,
and I wanna call her.

38:25.771 --> 38:27.439
And then I wanna delete her.

38:28.840 --> 38:30.409
But I can't do either

38:30.442 --> 38:34.646
because I am scared,
and I am weak.

38:34.680 --> 38:36.615
No, that's not true.

38:36.648 --> 38:38.817
No, but, I mean, it is.

38:38.850 --> 38:41.920
Because, otherwise,
I would be better.

38:41.953 --> 38:45.123
And I keep willing myself
to just get over it,

38:45.156 --> 38:47.959
but I can't.

38:47.993 --> 38:50.328
And that's why I've lost hope.

38:51.129 --> 38:52.898
That's why I was angry

38:52.931 --> 38:56.334
and why I refused to see Julia
the way that you saw her.

38:57.869 --> 38:59.805
You know, I...

39:01.573 --> 39:04.843
I stopped believing, too.

39:04.876 --> 39:08.046
I didn't think I would ever
get through the heartbreak.

39:08.079 --> 39:11.049
But, guess what,
I'm getting through it.

39:11.082 --> 39:13.485
And you are far stronger
than I am.

39:15.020 --> 39:16.855
See, you're always hopeful.

39:16.888 --> 39:18.524
So are you.

39:18.557 --> 39:21.727
You were hopeful
when you made the decision

39:21.760 --> 39:24.396
that you could have more.

39:24.430 --> 39:26.097
And you know what?
I think you're right.

39:26.131 --> 39:28.667
I think there is
another person
out there for you,

39:28.700 --> 39:30.436
and I think you will be a mom.

39:30.469 --> 39:34.773
You... You will have
all the things.

39:39.177 --> 39:41.513
I'm glad you're the way
that you are.

39:42.748 --> 39:44.015
You, too.

39:51.757 --> 39:54.460
Where's Ruby?
Your text said
you picked her up.

39:54.493 --> 39:55.661
She's fine, okay?

39:55.694 --> 39:57.896
She's at my apartment.
She's sleeping.

39:57.929 --> 39:59.565
She called me
when you disappeared.

39:59.598 --> 40:02.033
She thought you'd come in
to work, but you hadn't.

40:02.067 --> 40:05.036
My God, how could I
do this to her?

40:05.070 --> 40:06.872
What if I'd been driving
at the time?

40:06.905 --> 40:08.173
She's safe, all right?

40:08.206 --> 40:10.175
She did the right thing.
She called for help.

40:11.977 --> 40:13.545
Was she scared?

40:14.680 --> 40:16.548
Yes. We all are.

40:17.816 --> 40:19.050
Do you...

40:20.552 --> 40:21.987
Do you remember any--

40:22.020 --> 40:26.191
No. I don't, I...
Same as always.

40:26.224 --> 40:28.494
Ruby told me
about the other times.

40:29.761 --> 40:30.996
What?

40:32.130 --> 40:34.165
No. She doesn't know.

40:34.199 --> 40:36.902
Sam, she's a smart kid.

40:36.935 --> 40:39.070
She knows something's wrong.

40:39.104 --> 40:41.873
She knows that you go places
and then you don't remember
where you've gone.

40:41.907 --> 40:43.575
You told her I was sick?

40:43.609 --> 40:45.611
I told her that we didn't know
what was wrong yet.

40:45.644 --> 40:49.481
You told a 12-year-old
her mother has a disease
no one can diagnose?

40:49.515 --> 40:52.250
I reassured her
that you didn't abandon her--

40:52.283 --> 40:55.186
You had no right
to tell her anything.

40:56.221 --> 40:57.756
Just because you're my boss

40:57.789 --> 41:00.125
does not mean you can make
decisions for my family.

41:00.158 --> 41:02.494
But, no, it wasn't like that.
It was--

41:02.528 --> 41:06.131
No one makes
those decisions but me.

41:06.164 --> 41:08.567
Sam, your blackouts
are coinciding with something.

41:08.600 --> 41:10.636
-I just need
to ask you a few--
-Silence!

41:16.608 --> 41:17.909
Sam?

41:20.546 --> 41:21.647
Sam?

41:25.250 --> 41:27.619
Sam, did you just
have a blackout?

41:30.556 --> 41:31.657
Yeah.

41:31.690 --> 41:33.625
You don't remember
anything you said?

41:33.659 --> 41:34.926
No.

41:37.162 --> 41:40.932
Sam, honey,
it's okay, all right?

41:40.966 --> 41:42.668
I know what's wrong with you.

41:45.937 --> 41:47.673
I'm gonna make you better.
