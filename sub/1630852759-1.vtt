01:39.166 --> 01:42.069
Jack, have you seen my phone?

01:54.647 --> 01:55.815
Hello, Grace.

01:55.949 --> 01:57.851
This is Frank Caldwell again.

01:57.984 --> 01:59.819
Just wanted to check in and let you know

01:59.953 --> 02:01.522
I've been doing some more of that research

02:01.654 --> 02:03.557
out here into your family.

02:03.690 --> 02:05.959
I found some real interesting stuff.

02:06.093 --> 02:08.162
I think you're going to be surprised.

02:08.294 --> 02:09.996
Just so you know if I
ain't here when you guys

02:10.131 --> 02:11.965
get to my place, just let yourself in,

02:12.099 --> 02:13.534
make yourself at home.

02:13.666 --> 02:15.503
Key's under the flower pot out front.

02:15.635 --> 02:18.606
Anyways, you kids drive
safe, I'll see you real soon.

02:18.738 --> 02:19.806
Bye now.

02:19.939 --> 02:22.143
Oh yeah, watch out for snakes.

02:28.915 --> 02:30.184
Bah!

02:30.317 --> 02:31.085
Jack!

02:33.720 --> 02:34.988
You smell good.

02:36.656 --> 02:38.691
What was that, Caldwell again?

02:38.825 --> 02:41.728
Yeah, just confirming again.

02:42.896 --> 02:44.831
Seems eager to meet you.

02:44.964 --> 02:48.068
He's just being polite,
it's a Southern thing.

02:49.736 --> 02:52.439
You really think this guy
can help you find your parents?

02:54.208 --> 02:55.209
I hope so.

02:56.010 --> 02:59.146
He's the first real lead
I've had in 10 years.

03:00.514 --> 03:03.517
Well no matter what
happens, I've always loved

03:04.285 --> 03:07.987
a woman of mystery, it's very mysterious.

03:09.190 --> 03:10.990
Okay, I need to finish packing.

03:11.125 --> 03:14.094
It's going to be hell
getting out of the city.

03:14.228 --> 03:15.095
Hey.

03:16.297 --> 03:19.099
I just, look, I don't want
you to be disappointed

03:19.233 --> 03:20.867
if it's another dead end.

03:24.305 --> 03:29.109
That's why I am happy
you're coming with me.

03:31.978 --> 03:33.447
Yeah, about that.

03:33.581 --> 03:36.749
I was thinking maybe we
could take a little detour.

03:36.883 --> 03:38.085
What kind of detour?

03:38.219 --> 03:40.321
Well, it's not exactly on the way,

03:40.454 --> 03:45.292
but waterfront property,
obnoxious rich people,

03:45.426 --> 03:46.960
overrated Italian food.

03:48.596 --> 03:49.496
Hamptons.

03:51.265 --> 03:52.732
You want me to meet your parents?

03:52.865 --> 03:54.934
Yes, I want you to meet my parents.

03:55.669 --> 03:56.637
- Is that a yes?
- Yes.

03:56.769 --> 03:58.205
Yes, Jack.

03:58.339 --> 04:01.075
Yes, I mean a little warning
would have been nice.

04:01.208 --> 04:02.742
They're going to love you.

04:02.875 --> 04:04.545
They don't love anyone,
but they will love you

04:04.678 --> 04:05.912
because I love you.

04:06.046 --> 04:07.114
No pressure.

04:07.248 --> 04:08.649
Okay, well, maybe I should, you know,

04:08.781 --> 04:09.749
get my hair done, just in case.

04:09.882 --> 04:13.153
You are perfect in any haircut.

04:13.287 --> 04:15.623
You could shave your head
right, you'll be perfect.

04:16.322 --> 04:18.891
Don't worry, everything's
going to be fine.

06:48.842 --> 06:49.942
Hi.

06:50.077 --> 06:52.079
What you know good, little lady?

06:55.249 --> 06:56.450
New York, huh?

06:57.151 --> 06:58.285
That obvious?

07:00.053 --> 07:01.255
I saw the plates.

07:03.956 --> 07:05.359
Yeah.

07:05.492 --> 07:07.227
You said you could close
this deal so close it.

07:07.361 --> 07:08.928
I'm giving it to Steve.

07:09.929 --> 07:11.231
We both live there.

07:11.365 --> 07:14.334
I'm originally from around these parts.

07:16.670 --> 07:17.571
Lucky guy.

07:22.609 --> 07:23.644
Hey, dude.

07:27.181 --> 07:29.349
You don't have a card swipe.

07:29.483 --> 07:30.717
Cash only.

07:30.851 --> 07:31.752
Right.

07:31.885 --> 07:32.820
Do you have a bathroom?

07:32.952 --> 07:34.221
Shitter's around the back.

07:37.257 --> 07:39.493
Want to give me one of those?

07:47.100 --> 07:49.102
Come on, Grace, just talk to me.

07:50.037 --> 07:52.506
You made me feel like shit, Jack.

07:52.639 --> 07:53.740
The entire weekend.

07:54.441 --> 07:56.376
Look, my parents are old school.

07:56.510 --> 07:58.512
Old money and no one's going to be

07:58.645 --> 08:00.080
good enough for my mother, I warned you.

08:00.214 --> 08:01.815
No, it's not your parents.

08:01.949 --> 08:04.251
It's how you made me feel.

08:04.384 --> 08:06.553
You didn't stick up for me once.

08:10.057 --> 08:12.626
Gracie, I'm sorry.

08:13.861 --> 08:15.395
Can we please move on?

08:18.632 --> 08:19.533
Sure.

11:21.882 --> 11:23.784
Mr. Caldwell, hello?

11:27.888 --> 11:30.091
He said he'd be here.

11:30.223 --> 11:31.458
Well he said if he wasn't around

11:31.591 --> 11:33.994
to let ourselves in.

11:34.128 --> 11:36.030
What are you, trespassing?

11:36.164 --> 11:37.864
He told me where the key was, Jack.

11:37.998 --> 11:40.367
This is the South, they
shoot to kill out here.

11:40.500 --> 11:41.468
Yeah, like they don't kill people

11:41.601 --> 11:43.137
in New York or Chicago?

11:43.270 --> 11:44.638
You know what I mean.

11:44.771 --> 11:45.639
Relax.

11:46.440 --> 11:48.208
It's the 21st century South.

11:50.243 --> 11:51.378
Hello?

11:53.480 --> 11:55.449
Mr. Caldwell, hello?

11:58.985 --> 12:00.253
It's Grace Covington.

12:02.489 --> 12:03.790
Wonder where he is.

12:05.459 --> 12:07.360
Furnished by Norman Bates.

12:09.596 --> 12:11.498
Well, I'm excited to be here.

12:15.302 --> 12:16.770
I think it's amazing.

12:21.109 --> 12:22.609
Seems like nobody's home.

12:25.312 --> 12:26.446
Hello?

12:27.247 --> 12:30.283
Frank, are you here?

12:39.227 --> 12:41.261
I wonder where he is.

12:42.796 --> 12:43.697
Ugh.

12:44.698 --> 12:46.733
Smells like something died in here.

12:48.802 --> 12:50.804
Sure hope there's another bedroom.

12:54.407 --> 12:55.976
Hello?

12:56.110 --> 12:57.011
Frank.

12:59.746 --> 13:01.115
Looks like my mother's handbag.

13:02.250 --> 13:03.450
Come on.

13:03.583 --> 13:05.519
I need you to take this seriously.

13:05.652 --> 13:07.054
This is important to me.

13:10.390 --> 13:13.293
Surprise, more creepy shit.

13:19.733 --> 13:21.568
I'm going to find the whiskey.

13:24.238 --> 13:25.972
This shit is everywhere in here.

13:35.216 --> 13:36.083
Come on.

13:36.217 --> 13:37.317
Come on.

13:40.188 --> 13:42.422
And it's a sober house.

13:44.125 --> 13:46.426
I want to see the back.

14:04.544 --> 14:05.779
This place is magic.

14:08.082 --> 14:09.083
We could live here.

14:11.551 --> 14:12.652
Or not.

14:14.554 --> 14:15.455
You're not from the South,

14:15.589 --> 14:17.390
you wouldn't understand.

14:17.524 --> 14:20.094
You're right, I don't.

14:20.228 --> 14:22.529
But I do love you.

14:22.662 --> 14:24.397
Thank you.

14:24.531 --> 14:25.765
Thank you?

14:26.633 --> 14:28.269
Grace, I know this
weekend wasn't the best,

14:28.401 --> 14:29.803
but these things happen.

14:31.005 --> 14:32.106
I know.

14:32.240 --> 14:34.141
I'm going to go for a run.

14:35.675 --> 14:37.711
Can you get the bags?

18:10.690 --> 18:11.791
Hello?

18:13.561 --> 18:14.661
Hello?

18:16.297 --> 18:17.997
Mr. Caldwell, hello?

18:22.470 --> 18:24.171
We're at the plantation.

18:57.605 --> 18:58.705
Ah!

19:17.991 --> 19:19.326
- Jack.
- Shit.

19:20.494 --> 19:21.462
What happened?

19:21.595 --> 19:23.264
There was a snake up there.

19:23.397 --> 19:24.532
Okay, come here.

19:24.664 --> 19:25.765
I got you.

19:32.540 --> 19:37.844
There's like a serious redneck
art installation out there.

19:39.580 --> 19:40.947
Skulls and shit.

19:42.516 --> 19:43.683
That's a totem.

19:46.120 --> 19:47.488
Like a totem pole?

19:48.322 --> 19:50.857
No, it's supposed to
keep evil spirits away.

19:50.990 --> 19:52.193
Hillbilly voodoo.

19:53.826 --> 19:55.095
It's a Southern thing.

19:55.229 --> 19:56.463
Right.

19:56.597 --> 19:57.830
Okay, you have one more
piece, but it's a big one.

19:57.964 --> 19:59.966
Jack, just pull it out.

20:00.100 --> 20:02.403
Okay, count of three.

20:04.138 --> 20:05.039
One,

20:07.408 --> 20:08.309
two,

20:09.776 --> 20:10.511
three.

20:13.746 --> 20:15.782
I'm going to get a first aid kit.

20:34.168 --> 20:35.569
That should hold you over,

20:35.703 --> 20:37.438
but you need stitches.
Need to get you to an ER.

20:37.571 --> 20:38.838
Jack, we just got here.

20:38.972 --> 20:40.207
We can't leave.

20:40.341 --> 20:42.509
Let's just get out of here.

20:42.643 --> 20:44.578
This whole thing is weird.

20:44.712 --> 20:47.514
Snake, smell, all of it.

20:47.648 --> 20:49.216
I know that it's been a lot.

20:49.350 --> 20:50.117
A lot?

20:50.251 --> 20:51.851
You know what I've been through.

20:52.885 --> 20:55.322
My whole life to feel...

20:55.456 --> 20:56.357
Alone?

20:58.492 --> 20:59.892
Yeah.

21:00.027 --> 21:00.960
I'm not going to pretend
I know what it's like

21:01.095 --> 21:02.529
to grow up in a foster home,

21:03.297 --> 21:06.667
but my childhood wasn't easy.

21:06.799 --> 21:09.203
My family can be kind of tough at times.

21:10.037 --> 21:11.472
Yeah, but you have one.

21:12.473 --> 21:13.374
I don't.

21:15.775 --> 21:17.411
Jack, I am sorry.

21:18.245 --> 21:20.748
I don't know what it is about this house

21:20.880 --> 21:23.751
but I have to stay.

21:23.883 --> 21:27.787
Hey, I know this is important to you.

21:27.920 --> 21:29.056
I promise we're not going to leave

21:29.189 --> 21:30.957
until we get some answers.

23:22.603 --> 23:26.473
Grace?

23:41.954 --> 23:43.190
Grace!

23:45.859 --> 23:47.060
The door's stuck.

23:59.740 --> 24:00.641
Grace!

24:01.809 --> 24:02.942
Grace?

24:07.147 --> 24:08.248
Grace.

24:09.516 --> 24:10.417
Grace.

24:46.420 --> 24:47.488
Grace.

24:52.593 --> 24:53.494
Grace!

25:11.345 --> 25:12.446
What was that?

25:14.848 --> 25:15.849
What was what?

25:15.983 --> 25:17.985
That sound and the door.

25:18.752 --> 25:20.988
Something's wrong here,
Frank never showed up,

25:21.154 --> 25:23.123
we're here alone, everything's weird.

25:23.257 --> 25:26.460
Look, we need to leave right now.

25:40.841 --> 25:42.409
Let me get the bags in the car.

25:42.543 --> 25:44.645
My phone's on the nightstand.

26:14.374 --> 26:16.176
I couldn't find your phone.

26:16.310 --> 26:17.611
I told you it's on the nightstand.

26:17.744 --> 26:20.080
I looked, mine's not
where it was either.

26:23.483 --> 26:25.185
I'm going to put this stuff in the car

26:25.319 --> 26:27.120
and I'll check one more time.

26:32.426 --> 26:33.527
Jesus Christ.

26:36.229 --> 26:36.964
What is it?

26:37.097 --> 26:38.198
Stay back.

26:39.733 --> 26:41.134
Oh my God, Jack.

26:41.268 --> 26:42.169
Jack, get inside.

26:42.302 --> 26:43.737
Not fucking funny, guys.

26:45.172 --> 26:46.406
You know what this is?

26:46.540 --> 26:48.408
This is some good old
boys trying to scare us.

26:48.542 --> 26:50.110
Yeah, well I'm scared.

26:50.243 --> 26:51.678
Shit's been weird
ever since we got here,

26:51.812 --> 26:52.512
we're being catfished.

26:52.646 --> 26:54.281
No one's catfishing us.

26:54.414 --> 26:55.949
I was the one who found this place.

26:56.084 --> 26:57.085
I was the one who called him.

26:57.217 --> 26:58.118
Where is he?

26:58.251 --> 26:59.386
Where's your Mr. Caldwell?

27:00.054 --> 27:01.254
I don't know!

27:03.490 --> 27:04.925
This is the plan.

27:05.059 --> 27:06.193
I'm going to pull the car
around and we're getting

27:06.326 --> 27:07.628
the fuck out of here.

27:09.429 --> 27:10.897
What about our phones?

27:11.032 --> 27:12.899
Fuck the phones, I'll
buy you 10 phones tomorrow.

27:20.474 --> 27:22.309
You guys want to fuck with me?

28:48.562 --> 28:52.265
Jack, what are we going to do?

28:54.534 --> 28:56.470
Looks like some kind of a cult,

28:56.603 --> 28:59.239
skinhead Klan gang.

28:59.372 --> 29:01.908
The Klan doesn't kill
cats, they kill people.

29:02.576 --> 29:04.045
Then What is this?

29:04.178 --> 29:05.812
- How am I supposed to know?
- You're from the South.

29:05.946 --> 29:06.680
So?

29:06.813 --> 29:07.981
So these are your people.

29:08.116 --> 29:09.950
Those aren't my people, Jackson.

29:10.084 --> 29:11.284
I'm sorry, I'm just...

29:11.418 --> 29:13.420
No, explain it to me.

29:13.553 --> 29:15.123
I've never seen
anything like this before.

29:15.255 --> 29:17.390
They don't teach this shit at Princeton.

29:21.561 --> 29:22.462
It's weird how they're just

29:22.596 --> 29:24.431
standing there not moving.

29:49.056 --> 29:50.024
It works.

30:06.207 --> 30:07.808
Hello?

30:07.941 --> 30:08.842
Can you hear me?

30:13.380 --> 30:14.481
Jack.

30:21.255 --> 30:22.355
Jack.

30:24.891 --> 30:25.792
Jack!

30:39.006 --> 30:40.241
Well done, guys.

30:40.373 --> 30:41.708
You don't mess around.

30:42.475 --> 30:44.511
Listen, you had your fun,

30:44.644 --> 30:46.080
you scared us good.

30:46.214 --> 30:48.815
Now how about you take
your little seance...

31:21.815 --> 31:23.583
Seance up the street.

31:23.717 --> 31:25.152
Jack, stop.

31:25.286 --> 31:26.987
This is private property
and you are trespassing.

31:27.121 --> 31:28.256
Stop.

31:28.421 --> 31:29.623
And my dad's a litigator and he'll

31:29.756 --> 31:31.591
fuck you up in court.

31:39.166 --> 31:40.800
And your hats look stupid.

31:50.977 --> 31:53.613
- What are we going to do?
- Just wait here.

33:33.114 --> 33:36.283
We don't want
you, give us the girl.

33:36.417 --> 33:37.684
We'll let you go.

33:37.817 --> 33:41.921
Otherwise, you will not
live to see the sunrise.

33:51.965 --> 33:52.866
Grace?

33:55.568 --> 33:57.238
Were you just on the phone?

33:57.371 --> 33:59.539
Yeah, it rang and then...

33:59.672 --> 34:00.740
it's dead.

34:01.475 --> 34:02.376
I'm sorry.

34:02.510 --> 34:03.310
Hey, hey, for what?

34:03.444 --> 34:05.112
I brought us here.

34:05.745 --> 34:07.547
No, no, no, no, no.

34:07.680 --> 34:09.483
I was thinking we should
come back for the 4th,

34:09.616 --> 34:11.284
bring my parents.

34:11.418 --> 34:12.386
Jack.

34:17.291 --> 34:18.092
Maybe it's the cops.

34:18.225 --> 34:19.427
It could be them.

34:19.559 --> 34:20.860
I gotta find out.

34:54.793 --> 34:55.628
Who the fuck are you?

34:55.762 --> 34:57.498
Who the fuck are you?

34:57.630 --> 34:58.765
Gage?

35:02.836 --> 35:04.671
Well, you kids are in
the wrong fucking house.

35:04.804 --> 35:05.805
Man, you have no fucking idea.

35:05.939 --> 35:06.773
He might not be one of them.

35:06.906 --> 35:08.109
Fuck yeah he is.

35:08.242 --> 35:09.276
I'm only going to
say this one more time:

35:09.410 --> 35:10.844
who the fuck are you?

35:10.977 --> 35:12.313
Okay, an we calm down
and stop with the "fucks"?

35:12.446 --> 35:13.180
Fuck no.

35:13.314 --> 35:14.647
Jack.

35:14.781 --> 35:16.317
Where's Gage?

35:16.450 --> 35:17.384
The fuck is Gage?

35:17.518 --> 35:19.053
This is his goddamn house.

35:19.186 --> 35:22.622
No, this is Frank Caldwell's house.

35:24.291 --> 35:25.758
Nobody calls him that.

35:26.427 --> 35:27.428
Okay.

35:27.561 --> 35:29.296
I'm Grace, this is Jack.

35:29.430 --> 35:32.433
Frank, Gage, invited us.

35:32.566 --> 35:34.135
Invited you to do what?

35:35.369 --> 35:36.970
To find my parents.

35:39.406 --> 35:41.008
Who are your parents?

35:41.142 --> 35:43.210
That's the thing, I don't know.

35:43.344 --> 35:44.777
Guys, can we pick
this up a little later?

35:44.911 --> 35:45.845
We have a real situation.

35:45.979 --> 35:47.081
No, no we can't do this later.

35:47.214 --> 35:48.748
If you don't tell me who the fuck you are

35:48.882 --> 35:49.949
and what's going on here, I'm gonna

35:50.084 --> 35:51.352
start swinging this thing.

35:51.485 --> 35:53.187
Try me pal, I'm a black belt.

35:53.920 --> 35:56.123
A black belt in what, trespassing?

35:57.358 --> 35:58.125
Okay, listen.

35:58.259 --> 35:59.692
I've been speaking with Frank.

35:59.826 --> 36:01.761
He said to let ourselves
in if he wasn't here.

36:01.895 --> 36:02.929
And what happened, you got bored

36:03.063 --> 36:04.764
and decided to skin that goddamn cat?

36:04.898 --> 36:05.633
They did that.

36:05.765 --> 36:07.168
They did that.

36:07.301 --> 36:08.602
Who's they?

36:08.735 --> 36:10.237
Cloak and dagger outside.

36:10.371 --> 36:11.804
There's nobody outside,
you high on something, boy?

36:11.938 --> 36:13.374
Not fucking high.

36:13.507 --> 36:14.908
I tell you what, how
about if I call the sheriff?

36:15.042 --> 36:15.942
He'll come over here
and figure all this out.

36:16.076 --> 36:17.144
Throw your asses in jail.

36:17.278 --> 36:18.646
Already tried that, but by all means,

36:18.778 --> 36:19.879
get the whole damn department out here.

36:20.014 --> 36:22.149
Goddammit, that is what I'm going to do.

36:22.283 --> 36:23.816
I'm going to call the sheriff.

36:23.950 --> 36:25.419
Now put that poker down and both of you

36:25.553 --> 36:26.520
stand over there by that window

36:26.654 --> 36:28.289
where I can keep an eye on you.

36:29.523 --> 36:30.924
Please don't leave us.

36:31.858 --> 36:32.792
My phone's in the truck.

36:32.926 --> 36:34.461
I'll be right back, darling.

36:37.464 --> 36:38.299
Yeah, let him go, honey.

36:38.432 --> 36:39.333
Please.

36:40.700 --> 36:41.901
Better him than us.

36:44.704 --> 36:46.839
They're both high as a fucking kite.

36:58.352 --> 36:59.687
Sheryl Lee?

36:59.819 --> 37:00.588
Yeah, yeah.

37:00.720 --> 37:01.754
Yeah, it's Wayne.

37:01.888 --> 37:03.923
Yeah listen, I need to talk to Bill.

37:07.394 --> 37:08.728
What?

37:08.861 --> 37:10.431
No, I haven't been drinking.

37:12.666 --> 37:13.766
Hello?

37:15.202 --> 37:17.371
This goddamn reception out here.

37:19.640 --> 37:20.374
Hello?

37:23.477 --> 37:24.378
Who is this?

37:35.289 --> 37:36.190
Mister.

37:38.025 --> 37:39.426
Mister, come on.

37:45.965 --> 37:48.001
Is that you, Brady?

37:50.537 --> 37:51.739
All right, listen here.

37:51.871 --> 37:53.407
You boys are trespassing
right now goddammit.

37:53.540 --> 37:57.077
And it is within my legal
rights to do something about it.

37:57.211 --> 37:59.346
You just stay right there, goddammit.

38:05.818 --> 38:07.920
You said you tried to call the sheriff?

38:08.055 --> 38:09.956
Yeah, line went dead.

38:12.792 --> 38:14.161
Don't all you guys have guns?

38:14.861 --> 38:17.864
Brother's got a 12 gauge
shotgun up here somewhere.

38:17.997 --> 38:20.601
He practically sleeps
with the goddamn thing.

38:20.734 --> 38:22.636
You know who they are, don't you?

38:22.770 --> 38:24.305
Well, you hear stories over the years.

38:24.438 --> 38:26.973
All kinds of crazy shit
about cults and all that,

38:27.107 --> 38:28.275
but I never paid it much mind.

38:28.409 --> 38:30.544
Well it's time to pay it some mind.

38:30.678 --> 38:32.812
What are they, devil worshipers?

38:32.945 --> 38:34.048
Serpent.

38:36.916 --> 38:38.018
Serpent?

38:38.885 --> 38:40.054
Who are you?

38:40.920 --> 38:43.157
I told you, I'm looking for my family.

38:45.025 --> 38:47.328
Your brother's the
one who lured us here.

38:47.461 --> 38:48.295
My brother.

38:49.129 --> 38:50.731
My brother might be a dipstick idiot,

38:50.863 --> 38:51.864
but I'll tell you right now he's not

38:51.998 --> 38:53.200
part of some goddamn cult.

38:53.334 --> 38:55.269
Now you on the other hand,

38:55.402 --> 38:57.604
you seem to know an awful lot
about what's going on here.

38:57.738 --> 38:58.706
Maybe you're part of it, maybe you

38:58.838 --> 38:59.473
did something with my brother.

38:59.606 --> 39:00.541
What?

39:00.674 --> 39:01.775
Come on, man, we're trying to

39:01.908 --> 39:03.444
get away from the freak show, not join it.

39:03.577 --> 39:05.312
Yeah, well right now we
better find that goddamn gun.

39:54.361 --> 39:55.262
Don't.

41:30.524 --> 41:33.293
Son of a bitch!

45:56.990 --> 45:57.891
Hey.

46:04.998 --> 46:05.966
You were dreaming.

46:07.135 --> 46:08.035
Sorry.

46:09.636 --> 46:11.605
Sounded like a nightmare.

46:13.273 --> 46:14.474
I was running.

46:18.645 --> 46:19.846
From what?

46:20.814 --> 46:22.516
I don't know what it was.

46:24.351 --> 46:27.988
I was in the woods and it was dark.

46:31.358 --> 46:34.795
I had this overwhelming feeling like...

46:34.928 --> 46:36.296
What?

46:38.032 --> 46:41.935
You ever have a dream
that you're running

46:42.702 --> 46:47.041
no matter how hard you
try, you can't get away.

46:51.678 --> 46:53.747
We've all had those dreams, Grace.

46:58.985 --> 47:00.353
I was so alone.

47:01.354 --> 47:05.759
You're not alone,
you'll never be alone.

47:07.627 --> 47:09.462
I'll always be with you.

47:19.873 --> 47:22.375
Why are we still alive?

47:23.277 --> 47:26.880
Jack, they can come in at any moment.

47:27.681 --> 47:29.050
Why are they not killing us?

47:29.183 --> 47:30.951
Why are they not coming in?

47:33.587 --> 47:36.423
They could, but they're not.

47:45.365 --> 47:46.867
I need that gun.

52:27.847 --> 52:31.018
What the hell do you want from me?

52:32.386 --> 52:34.288
It's at hand.

52:37.424 --> 52:39.393
The Equinox is upon us.

52:42.996 --> 52:46.033
The Serpent will sleep no longer.

52:47.700 --> 52:48.735
Let us go!

52:49.669 --> 52:53.907
The world has
been cruel to you, Grace.

52:54.041 --> 52:56.577
How do you know my name?

52:56.709 --> 52:58.546
Don't you want to belong?

52:58.678 --> 53:00.247
Leave us alone!

53:11.592 --> 53:13.927
They were talking to me.

53:14.061 --> 53:15.329
They knew my name.

54:04.545 --> 54:05.845
It's empty.

54:07.114 --> 54:08.515
There's shells upstairs.

54:27.368 --> 54:28.269
Oh!

54:39.779 --> 54:40.880
Jack!

55:57.491 --> 55:58.925
Look at this.

56:01.928 --> 56:04.931
I mean there must be dozens
of languages in here.

56:08.802 --> 56:11.038
What is this, Latin?

56:12.272 --> 56:15.975
"Et descendat anguis morsu in Terra."

56:17.745 --> 56:19.446
Six years of Catholic school.

56:20.781 --> 56:24.318
"The Serpent will sink
its fangs into the Earth."

56:24.451 --> 56:28.288
It says here that pilgrims
fleeing persecution

56:28.422 --> 56:29.956
arrived in the New World.

56:30.758 --> 56:33.494
It was here they discovered
an ancient demon,

56:34.228 --> 56:36.397
Uktena, the Serpent.

56:38.065 --> 56:40.933
The settlers, seduced by Uktena's power,

56:41.702 --> 56:44.838
rejected their Christian
faith and began to

56:44.971 --> 56:47.074
worship the demon as a god.

56:48.575 --> 56:53.247
But the Indians rose up,
slaughtering the pilgrims,

56:53.980 --> 56:56.450
trapping the evil spirit on their land.

56:58.252 --> 57:01.054
It is prophesied that
Uktena's disciples will return

57:01.188 --> 57:06.427
to free the demon and
manifest it in human form.

57:10.898 --> 57:15.636
Here, the Master carries within them

57:16.437 --> 57:20.641
a perfect child to give the demon a host

57:20.774 --> 57:23.777
to burn away man, start anew,

57:24.678 --> 57:27.381
but it must happen when
the portals are open

57:28.148 --> 57:32.486
and the planets align
at the Vernal Equinox.

57:34.188 --> 57:35.322
This will bring on...

57:37.825 --> 57:39.259
The Long Night.

57:42.529 --> 57:43.963
Jack.

57:44.964 --> 57:46.333
What are we going to do?

57:47.967 --> 57:49.369
I have no idea.

58:41.088 --> 58:42.656
Go, go, go, go.

59:45.252 --> 59:46.753
Grace.

59:52.626 --> 59:53.527
Grace.

59:57.097 --> 59:58.198
Grace.

01:00:04.204 --> 01:00:05.305
Grace!

01:00:08.009 --> 01:00:09.109
Grace!

01:00:15.349 --> 01:00:16.850
This ends now.

01:01:45.139 --> 01:01:46.306
Fuck you!

01:02:06.359 --> 01:02:08.261
What's happening?

01:02:09.262 --> 01:02:11.898
I gotta get you out of here.

01:02:25.278 --> 01:02:26.413
I'm bleeding out.

01:02:27.881 --> 01:02:28.615
Run ahead.

01:02:28.749 --> 01:02:29.516
What?

01:02:29.649 --> 01:02:30.584
I'm slowing you down, run ahead.

01:02:30.717 --> 01:02:31.785
I'm not going without you.

01:02:31.918 --> 01:02:34.321
We came here because they wanted you.

01:02:35.388 --> 01:02:37.357
- I can't.
- I need you to live.

01:02:38.391 --> 01:02:39.392
No, no!

01:02:39.526 --> 01:02:40.260
You can do this.

01:02:40.393 --> 01:02:42.763
Go, go, go!

01:09:42.448 --> 01:09:43.350
Please.

01:09:45.185 --> 01:09:46.086
Help.

01:09:49.122 --> 01:09:50.024
Please.

01:09:56.829 --> 01:09:57.931
Help!

01:10:11.744 --> 01:10:12.845
Help.

01:11:19.580 --> 01:11:20.447
Jack?

01:11:22.449 --> 01:11:23.350
Oh my God.

01:11:24.418 --> 01:11:25.985
Jack, Jack, Jack.

01:11:29.623 --> 01:11:30.524
I'm here.

01:11:35.629 --> 01:11:36.530
I got you.

01:11:37.431 --> 01:11:38.332
I got you.

01:11:57.984 --> 01:11:59.153
Stay back!

01:12:13.801 --> 01:12:15.835
As it was ordained.

01:12:17.904 --> 01:12:19.106
Welcome home.

01:12:19.239 --> 01:12:21.308
This is not my home.

01:12:22.376 --> 01:12:23.410
Grace.

01:12:25.612 --> 01:12:28.315
You're the first daughter
of the Millennium Master,

01:12:28.449 --> 01:12:32.786
born with one purpose: to free our savior...

01:12:32.919 --> 01:12:37.924
the Serpent Uktena,
from 400 years of prison

01:12:38.258 --> 01:12:39.892
on this property.

01:12:40.027 --> 01:12:42.062
I'm not a part of this.

01:12:42.196 --> 01:12:44.498
The universe has a pattern, Grace.

01:12:45.366 --> 01:12:48.302
A natural order that must be maintained.

01:12:48.435 --> 01:12:50.337
For 5,000 years, the Serpent has been

01:12:50.471 --> 01:12:53.273
the great equalizer, cleansing the evils

01:12:53.407 --> 01:12:57.344
of man from the world with his Venom.

01:12:59.346 --> 01:13:02.716
You're a death cult
who worships a demon.

01:13:02.850 --> 01:13:04.418
Just as a serpent sheds his skin,

01:13:04.551 --> 01:13:07.187
so must the world be cleansed of sin.

01:13:08.489 --> 01:13:11.058
The Serpent poisons the
blood of the wicked,

01:13:11.891 --> 01:13:17.331
prideful, the vicious, so that
the next renewal can begin.

01:13:22.836 --> 01:13:24.671
You want to destroy the world.

01:13:24.805 --> 01:13:25.639
To save it.

01:13:25.773 --> 01:13:27.674
I don't believe you.

01:13:27.808 --> 01:13:28.908
Yes you do.

01:13:29.777 --> 01:13:31.445
Look what humanity has wrought,

01:13:32.979 --> 01:13:35.649
all the pain and suffering.

01:13:37.551 --> 01:13:39.052
Pain binds us.

01:13:41.321 --> 01:13:45.292
Pain is a prison from
which no one can be free.

01:13:47.927 --> 01:13:51.098
Don't you wish to be
free of your pain, Grace?

01:13:52.866 --> 01:13:54.268
Don't you wish the world

01:13:56.236 --> 01:13:58.971
to be free of its pain?

01:14:01.508 --> 01:14:02.776
Yes.

01:14:02.910 --> 01:14:04.011
Yes.

01:14:05.846 --> 01:14:08.449
And you are the vessel that will take

01:14:08.582 --> 01:14:11.385
the spirit of Uktena into the world

01:14:11.518 --> 01:14:13.854
so the next cycle can begin.

01:14:13.986 --> 01:14:15.322
No, no.

01:14:16.056 --> 01:14:20.060
Grace, you can save the world.

01:14:20.194 --> 01:14:21.395
You can save us.

01:14:24.398 --> 01:14:28.235
As ordained though, it must begin tonight.

01:14:29.969 --> 01:14:31.071
Now.

01:14:31.905 --> 01:14:33.640
With the Vernal Equinox.

01:14:54.728 --> 01:14:56.430
You are Julia Grace,

01:14:59.099 --> 01:15:00.501
Serena Covington,

01:15:05.272 --> 01:15:07.307
and I am your mother.

01:17:41.328 --> 01:17:43.430
Welcome home, Grace.

01:18:07.354 --> 01:18:08.455
Yes.

01:18:51.132 --> 01:18:52.899
The Serpent rises.

01:19:32.272 --> 01:19:34.341
The Long Night begins.

01:19:45.153 --> 01:19:46.820
We release you, Lord Uktena.

01:19:48.855 --> 01:19:51.159
We, the guardians of The Long Night,

01:19:51.291 --> 01:19:52.893
are your humble servants.

01:19:56.396 --> 01:19:59.666
Instruct us.

01:19:59.800 --> 01:20:00.700
Guide us

01:20:02.270 --> 01:20:06.573
so that we may be
instruments of your Renewal.

01:26:10.404 --> 01:26:12.839
You are
the daughter of the first

01:26:12.972 --> 01:26:16.910
Millennium Master, born with one purpose

01:26:17.645 --> 01:26:20.281
to free our savior, Uktena,

01:26:21.848 --> 01:26:25.685
from 400 years of prison on this property.
