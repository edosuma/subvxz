It is impressive, I must say.

05:38.172 --> 05:39.548
Fredric Hauser.

05:39.590 --> 05:41.985
- Meyer Offerman.
- It's a pleasure to meet
you, Mr. Offerman.

05:42.009 --> 05:43.194
It's a pleasure
to meet you, too.

05:43.218 --> 05:46.013
I must say, given your stature
as a businessman,

05:46.055 --> 05:49.641
I'm surprised we haven't
crossed paths before.

05:49.683 --> 05:50.963
Perhaps, uh,
we weren't fated to.

05:51.935 --> 05:55.898
Let me show you
my pantheon of fortune.

05:58.400 --> 06:03.197
Tell me, Mr. Offerman, uh,
can you keep a secret?

06:03.238 --> 06:07.534
Well, I suppose that depends
on the secret. Hmm?

06:07.576 --> 06:09.953
A very fine answer.

06:09.995 --> 06:11.705
Well...

06:11.747 --> 06:13.791
But in this bank,

06:13.832 --> 06:18.212
our answer is always
a resounding yes.

06:18.253 --> 06:19.254
Yes.

06:22.007 --> 06:26.720
Secrecy is our currency,
Mr. Offerman.

06:29.139 --> 06:30.891
Let me ask you,

06:30.933 --> 06:32.309
do you think...

06:35.354 --> 06:37.981
that your money is being
protected right now?

06:38.023 --> 06:40.400
Hmm? No.
It is being taxed

06:40.442 --> 06:42.694
and tallied and scrutinized.

06:42.736 --> 06:44.613
But here,

06:44.655 --> 06:49.159
we operate on one
simple philosophy:

06:49.201 --> 06:53.497
they cannot take
what they cannot see.

06:53.539 --> 06:55.415
Ah.

07:14.726 --> 07:17.396
Jonah.

07:17.437 --> 07:19.231
Jonah?

07:22.025 --> 07:23.652
Come on, son, talk to me.

07:23.694 --> 07:27.239
Your friend was shot twice
during his shift.

07:27.281 --> 07:29.741
Nothing stolen,
nothing taken from the register.

07:29.783 --> 07:34.663
Any idea why this happened,
why he might have been targeted?

07:34.705 --> 07:35.956
No idea.

07:35.998 --> 07:38.375
Did you get a look at the guy?

07:42.004 --> 07:44.965
No. It was too dark.

07:47.593 --> 07:49.553
What?

07:49.595 --> 07:51.722
You had to have seen him.

07:51.763 --> 07:53.307
It was too dark.

07:53.348 --> 07:56.268
I didn't see shit.

07:56.310 --> 07:58.061
After your grandmother's murder,

07:58.103 --> 08:00.731
you came in here
spouting off every detail.

08:00.772 --> 08:02.983
You can remember how the guy
escaped down the alley,

08:03.025 --> 08:05.944
how he was wearing sweats,
how he had a black hat.

08:05.986 --> 08:10.407
And now your friend's dead, that
you hurried past the killer,

08:10.449 --> 08:11.992
and you got nothing for me?

08:12.034 --> 08:13.827
Jonah, you got to
help me out here.

08:13.869 --> 08:15.388
I don't know what to say.
I told you, it was dark.

08:15.412 --> 08:17.748
I-I couldn't see shit.
It was dark.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.352
What the fuck
do you want me to do?

08:21.376 --> 08:22.896
You want me to...
repeat myself all night?

08:22.920 --> 08:25.547
I... my best friend just got...

08:25.589 --> 08:28.008

09:18.684 --> 09:20.444
I want to talk to you

Can you let me in?

09:40.622 --> 09:42.374
He's not home.

- Any idea where he is?

You here about Arthur's murder?

10:00.684 --> 10:02.561
Who's Arthur?

10:02.602 --> 10:04.563
Our friend, who got
fucking murdered

10:04.604 --> 10:07.733
while selling fucking
comic books.

10:07.774 --> 10:09.985
I'm so sorry. When?

10:11.570 --> 10:13.530
Last night.

10:13.572 --> 10:15.991
Listen, if, uh...

10:16.033 --> 10:18.952
if you hear from Jonah,

10:18.994 --> 10:21.079
tell him I need to talk to him,
all right?

10:21.121 --> 10:24.082
He's not in trouble.
He's not in trouble.

10:24.124 --> 10:26.793
I'm just worried about him.

10:29.629 --> 10:32.591
Yeah. Me, too.

10:43.268 --> 10:45.979
FBI? What the fuck's Jonah into?

10:46.021 --> 10:47.606
I don't know.

10:47.647 --> 10:49.191
But he was late for his shift.

10:49.232 --> 10:53.278
It was supposed to be Jonah
behind that counter.

10:58.658 --> 11:00.702
The boy just got
his friend killed.

11:00.744 --> 11:02.412
You want him to get
one of us killed next?

11:02.454 --> 11:04.164
If they're onto him,
what's to keep them

11:04.206 --> 11:06.917
from following him here, to us?

11:06.958 --> 11:11.588
He stays here.
It's my house. It's my decision.

11:11.630 --> 11:13.799
It could threaten everything
we've worked for.

11:24.476 --> 11:26.937
The day of doom is July 13.

11:26.978 --> 11:29.398
Well, that's just weeks away.

11:29.439 --> 11:32.567
And our only lead is, what,
some bank the Nazis visited?

11:32.609 --> 11:36.279
And these keys to some bank,

11:36.321 --> 11:40.534
built on the backs
of a genocide.

11:40.575 --> 11:43.495
Fredric Hauser, the banker,
financed his empire

11:43.537 --> 11:45.872
on stolen Jewish loot.

11:45.914 --> 11:49.084
Fortunes, heirlooms.

11:49.126 --> 11:50.961
Old women's gold teeth.

11:51.002 --> 11:54.965
And I have no doubt
that his Swiss paws

11:55.006 --> 11:57.300
are keeping Nazi eggs warm.

12:00.178 --> 12:02.722
What is inside

12:02.764 --> 12:05.976
box 630?

12:06.017 --> 12:08.478
Oh, God, here we go.

12:08.520 --> 12:10.605
Excuse me, I want back in.

12:10.647 --> 12:13.066
I'm helping you take down
these Nazi fucks.

12:13.108 --> 12:15.086
Meyer, he should
never have been allowed...
- Excuse us a minute.

12:15.110 --> 12:18.572
Jonah, come here.
Come on.

12:18.613 --> 12:20.240
For fuck's sake.

12:20.282 --> 12:22.868
That anger burning in your soul,

12:22.909 --> 12:24.953
it can put us all in peril.

12:24.995 --> 12:26.538
It's a conflagration,

12:26.580 --> 12:29.207
and if you're not careful,
it will consume you.

12:29.249 --> 12:30.768
Enough with this fucking
backwards bullshit.

12:30.792 --> 12:31.751
You said revenge is
the best revenge.

12:31.793 --> 12:33.044
That's what you said.

12:33.086 --> 12:34.981
It was about your guy.
It was about your number one.

12:35.005 --> 12:36.923
It was about The Wolf.

12:36.965 --> 12:40.302
Well, that beady-eyed Nazi fuck

12:40.343 --> 12:43.513
- who killed my best friend
is mine.
- Personal revenge. Payback.

12:43.555 --> 12:47.517
That comes later, Jonah,
if ever.

12:47.559 --> 12:50.729
What we must do first
is about justice.

12:50.770 --> 12:53.940
It's about justice
for 11 million people.

12:53.982 --> 12:56.193
Your revenge is about you.

12:56.234 --> 12:58.171
I don't think you understand.
It's either you let me in

12:58.195 --> 12:59.422
to your little fucking
tea party,

12:59.446 --> 13:01.948
or I'm going out there
and I'm finding the motherfucker

13:01.990 --> 13:03.742
who killed
my best friend myself.

13:08.538 --> 13:13.168
Ma, Dad, I came as soon
as I heard.

13:13.210 --> 13:15.021
- Well, better late than never.
- It's nothing.

13:15.045 --> 13:17.506
Ma, it's not nothing, it's MS.

13:17.547 --> 13:19.299
You shouldn't have
left work for this.

13:19.341 --> 13:20.509
I'm fine.

13:20.550 --> 13:24.846
You're an angel, but I'm fine.
Really.

13:24.888 --> 13:27.891
She had another flare-up.

13:27.933 --> 13:30.435
But she's okay.

13:30.477 --> 13:31.811
We're taking good care of her.

13:31.853 --> 13:33.438
And speaking of angels,

13:33.480 --> 13:37.943
Maria has just been
the greatest blessing, as usual.

13:37.984 --> 13:40.612
The only one to ever take
proper care of me

13:40.654 --> 13:42.405
in this god-awful place.

13:43.949 --> 13:46.034
I'll give you some privacy.

13:46.076 --> 13:47.994
I need to run
to the restroom, Ma.

13:51.873 --> 13:53.351
- What?
- Are you gonna let me apologize?

13:53.375 --> 13:54.834
You sure you know how
to do that?

13:54.876 --> 13:56.270
Look, I know I shouldn't
have reacted like that,

13:56.294 --> 13:58.129
but I just... I...

14:03.134 --> 14:07.639
I wish I was better at this.
For you.

14:07.681 --> 14:10.183
Me, too.

14:10.225 --> 14:11.935
Dr. Richardson, 2315.

14:11.977 --> 14:13.812
I got to get back.

14:13.853 --> 14:16.690
Dr. Richardson, 2315.

14:18.316 --> 14:20.819
♪ O caminho do bem ♪

14:22.862 --> 14:24.447
♪ O caminho do bem... ♪

14:24.489 --> 14:26.116
Fucking surveillance duty?

14:26.157 --> 14:28.618
It's what they have
the fat cops do.

14:31.204 --> 14:32.640
You're not on duty.
You're only here because

14:32.664 --> 14:33.933
Meyer wants us to keep you safe.

14:33.957 --> 14:35.434
You're the baby,
and I'm the bloody sitter,

14:35.458 --> 14:36.960
so just shut up.

14:37.002 --> 14:38.878
Mind your little
sausage fingers.

14:38.920 --> 14:41.881
And don't get hurt.

14:47.721 --> 14:51.516
Besides, I had to push papers
for a full year at MI6

14:51.558 --> 14:54.644
before I was even allowed
on stakeout duty.

14:54.686 --> 14:55.997
You should consider
yourself lucky

14:56.021 --> 14:58.940
because surveillance is an art.

15:01.401 --> 15:03.111
What are we looking for, anyway?

15:03.153 --> 15:04.738
Stillness in the chaos.

15:09.409 --> 15:11.703
Speaking of chaos,
your friend sure pulled

15:11.745 --> 15:13.830
the muddy end
of the shit stick, didn't he?

15:13.872 --> 15:17.167
No, I pulled it for him.

15:17.208 --> 15:18.918
Well...

15:18.960 --> 15:21.421
sometimes, when you're trying
to protect your own world,

15:21.463 --> 15:25.383
you threaten the worlds
of those you love the most.

15:27.385 --> 15:29.638
If Ruth were here,
she would have told you that.

15:32.057 --> 15:34.100
Yeah, well, she didn't get
her best friend killed.

15:35.602 --> 15:38.313
She came damn well close enough.

15:43.943 --> 15:46.905
Your grandmother
told me a story once

15:46.946 --> 15:49.866
of when she was in the camps.

15:49.908 --> 15:53.787
She made a grave impression
on a Nazi doctor,

15:53.828 --> 15:55.789
Wilhelm Zuchs.

15:55.830 --> 15:57.749
The Wolf.

15:57.791 --> 16:00.126
Very early in her imprisonment,

16:00.168 --> 16:02.337
she did something
that caught The Wolf's eye,

16:02.379 --> 16:05.840
when she saved the life
of a young girl.

16:09.135 --> 16:11.596
He became fixated by her.

16:13.098 --> 16:15.100
Ruth had no idea.

16:15.141 --> 16:19.229
She spent her days
just trying to survive.

16:19.270 --> 16:22.148
Trying to steal a look
from her love, Meyer,

16:22.190 --> 16:24.442
not knowing that all this time

16:24.484 --> 16:28.988
The Wolf was stalking her,
his prey.

16:29.030 --> 16:33.451
And then, one day,
The Wolf finally made his move.

16:35.120 --> 16:37.914
I was hoping to find you here.

16:37.956 --> 16:40.875
I'm in need of a personal
secretary at the clinic.

16:40.917 --> 16:42.961
I've met with a few German girls

16:43.002 --> 16:44.629
from the steno pool,

16:45.630 --> 16:48.466
but needed someone...
exceptional.

16:48.508 --> 16:50.593
And I thought of you.

16:51.803 --> 16:54.139
You'd get your own room.

16:54.180 --> 16:58.893
A warm bed. Proper food.

16:58.935 --> 17:03.606
Only catch is
you'd have to work for

17:05.024 --> 17:08.236
a painfully disorganized doctor

17:08.278 --> 17:12.198
and make sense
of all his paperwork.

17:17.203 --> 17:19.164
Is this a choice?

17:19.205 --> 17:20.874
Or an order?

17:22.709 --> 17:25.128
A choice, of course.

17:25.170 --> 17:29.132
In that case,
I appreciate your offer.

17:30.592 --> 17:33.553
But I think I'll stay here.

17:38.683 --> 17:46.608
I hoped you'd have chosen
more wisely.

17:48.067 --> 17:50.653
But no meal or warm bed
would ever

17:50.695 --> 17:52.781
make up for the shame
that she would have felt

17:52.822 --> 17:55.492
if she had accepted
the devil's offer.

17:55.533 --> 17:58.328
And in that moment,
with that decision,

17:58.369 --> 18:00.038
Ruth threatened Meyer's world

18:00.079 --> 18:02.582
more than she could have ever
intended to.

18:02.624 --> 18:07.378
And The Wolf turned
his focus on Meyer.

18:15.512 --> 18:17.680
What'd he do to him?

18:18.932 --> 18:21.684
Well, that's not
my story to tell.

18:23.394 --> 18:26.397
But you're not
the only one, Jonah.

18:26.439 --> 18:28.691
Your grandmother...

18:28.733 --> 18:30.485
From that moment on,

18:30.527 --> 18:32.987
she felt forever
what you're feeling now.

18:35.114 --> 18:37.325
It's the reason
she made The Wolf

18:37.367 --> 18:39.410
number one on our list.

18:41.412 --> 18:44.499
It wasn't Meyer who did that?

18:44.541 --> 18:47.293

31:29.388 --> 31:31.508
Well, that just sounds more
calculated than what I do.

31:32.850 --> 31:36.812
Plus, it only really works if
your opponent makes a mistake.

31:39.148 --> 31:42.860
Can I be honest, Jonah?

31:42.901 --> 31:46.196
I'm no good at games 'cause
I just don't like playing 'em.

31:47.740 --> 31:49.283
Here's what I know.

31:49.325 --> 31:51.744
I know that your grandma
was killed.

31:52.911 --> 31:54.455
I know you told Detective Groton

31:54.496 --> 31:56.308
you didn't think it was
a robbery, and I know that,

31:56.332 --> 32:00.294
days later,
your best friend was murdered

32:00.336 --> 32:02.463
during what was supposed
to be your shift.

32:02.504 --> 32:05.382
And I cannot imagine what
all that must be like for you.

32:07.426 --> 32:11.180
No. No, you can't.

32:11.221 --> 32:13.766
I also know you went looking
for the person

32:13.807 --> 32:15.017
who killed your grandma.

32:17.436 --> 32:19.938
And, you know, if someone hurt

32:19.980 --> 32:22.900
the person I loved,
I would do the same thing,

32:22.941 --> 32:27.780
but there is a right way
and a wrong way to get justice.

32:27.821 --> 32:31.116
You can still choose
to do the right thing here.

32:31.158 --> 32:33.994
You got to come clean, Jonah.

32:38.957 --> 32:40.918
Why do the good guys

32:40.959 --> 32:45.255
always have to choose
to do the right thing?

32:45.297 --> 32:47.925
Doing the right thing didn't

32:47.966 --> 32:52.888
help Bruce Wayne get justice
for his family,

32:52.930 --> 32:56.350
or Frank Castle,

32:56.392 --> 32:58.644
Peter Parker.

32:58.686 --> 33:00.979
Are you trying
to tell me something?

33:02.398 --> 33:05.818
No, I'm just talking comics.

33:08.862 --> 33:11.573
We found a kid's jacket
at a murder scene.

33:11.615 --> 33:13.450
Couldn't figure out
who it belonged to.

33:13.492 --> 33:15.494
But get this,

33:15.536 --> 33:19.790
the victim had surveillance
photos of your grandmother,

33:19.832 --> 33:21.959
almost like he'd been
tracking her.

33:22.000 --> 33:25.003
Jonah, does this jacket
belong to you?

33:30.592 --> 33:34.972
See, I think you went
looking for justice

33:35.013 --> 33:36.724
and you got in over your head,

33:36.765 --> 33:38.392
and I think
you didn't do it alone.

33:38.434 --> 33:41.019
Okay? So listen to me,
I can protect you,

33:41.061 --> 33:44.940
but you have got to tell me
what is going on.

33:47.693 --> 33:49.486
Maybe what's really going on is,

33:49.528 --> 33:52.698
you're the one
in over your head.

33:52.740 --> 33:54.908
Where were you three nights ago?

33:54.950 --> 33:56.910
He was with me.

33:56.952 --> 33:58.245
Here.

33:58.287 --> 34:01.665
Any other questions,

34:01.707 --> 34:04.626
feel free to direct them
to the boy's attorney.

34:06.420 --> 34:08.255
Of course.

34:15.387 --> 34:17.014
You know,
it isn't that the good guys

34:17.055 --> 34:19.850
always have to choose
to do the right thing.

34:19.892 --> 34:21.852
It's that choosing
to do the right thing

34:21.894 --> 34:24.146
makes them the good guys.

34:27.107 --> 34:29.109
Good day, Millie.

34:33.155 --> 34:37.951
She lied. She is good at chess,

34:37.993 --> 34:41.705
and she's not
on our side, Jonah.

35:19.368 --> 35:21.662
How did you know
this is the way in?

35:21.703 --> 35:23.997
Because I built it.

35:26.083 --> 35:28.043
Quicker, Jakob!

35:43.642 --> 35:45.686
Praise be to God.

35:48.730 --> 35:51.859
Okay. Final step.

35:51.900 --> 35:53.277
Are you ready?

35:53.318 --> 35:55.112
Ja.

35:55.153 --> 35:58.657
Everyone has certain assets
they'd rather not

35:58.699 --> 36:00.617
see dragged into the light.

36:00.659 --> 36:05.122
I pride myself on knowing
how to keep things in the dark.

36:05.163 --> 36:09.293
Which is precisely
why I came here to you...

36:09.334 --> 36:12.129
a man whose eyes have adjusted

36:12.170 --> 36:14.882
to see in the darkness.

36:14.923 --> 36:17.467
Your German is perfect.

36:17.509 --> 36:18.927
We all had to learn

36:18.969 --> 36:20.971
new things to survive the war.

36:21.013 --> 36:22.306
Speaking of,

36:22.347 --> 36:24.808
and at the risk
of sounding uncouth,

36:24.850 --> 36:26.518
I'm afraid I must inquire

36:26.560 --> 36:31.231
because my investors will,
what did you do during the war?

36:31.273 --> 36:33.609
I maintained a policy

36:33.650 --> 36:35.903
of neutrality, and neutrality

36:35.944 --> 36:38.155
ensures stability.

36:38.196 --> 36:40.532
See no evil. Hear no evil.

36:40.574 --> 36:42.117
- Speak no evil.
- Hmm.

36:42.159 --> 36:44.119
But the evil still exists,
doesn't it?

36:44.161 --> 36:46.163
Right before your closed eyes

36:46.204 --> 36:48.874
and your sealed ears
and your muted tongue.

36:48.916 --> 36:50.751
And if one isn't careful,

36:50.792 --> 36:52.961
such willful blindness

36:53.003 --> 36:56.131
leads to rather
unsavory fortunes

36:56.173 --> 36:57.173
being procured.

36:58.175 --> 37:00.886
How disappointing.

37:00.928 --> 37:03.931
I thought you were different
from the others.

37:03.972 --> 37:05.182
What others?

37:05.223 --> 37:07.643
Oh, come now.
Surely we can both admit at the

37:07.684 --> 37:12.064
cruel jest being lectured

37:12.105 --> 37:14.191
on the ethics of moneylending

37:14.232 --> 37:16.234
from a Jew,

37:16.276 --> 37:19.613
and a hypocrite Jew as well.

37:19.655 --> 37:22.366
Where did you make your money
after the war, Mr. Offerman?

37:22.407 --> 37:24.576
And was it all as pure

37:24.618 --> 37:27.496
as the Matterhorn snow?
No, no, no.

37:27.537 --> 37:32.459
All fortunes are unsavory.

37:32.501 --> 37:34.586
There's not a dollar
on this earth

37:34.628 --> 37:36.463
that doesn't have
a little dirt on it.

37:36.505 --> 37:38.173
There's a difference between

37:38.215 --> 37:40.676
dirt and blood.

37:40.717 --> 37:43.679
Not if you clean it well enough.

37:43.720 --> 37:47.015
Blood always leaves a stain,
my friend,

37:47.057 --> 37:51.853
whether you can see it or not.

37:53.897 --> 37:55.565
If there's nothing else,

37:55.607 --> 37:59.861
I think I will show you out.

38:05.701 --> 38:07.619
- Hi.
- You again.

38:07.661 --> 38:10.038
Yeah. Look,

38:10.080 --> 38:11.873
I learned a few lessons
in Hollywood.

38:11.915 --> 38:15.168
One, never agree to a casting
session after 8:00 at night.

38:15.210 --> 38:17.546
And two, if you see
something you want,

38:17.587 --> 38:20.215
don't be afraid to ask for it
or you'll never get it.

38:20.257 --> 38:21.508
Life is short, huh,

38:21.550 --> 38:24.594
you only get so many shots,
you know? Kendra...

38:26.638 --> 38:29.266
there's something
happening between us.

38:29.307 --> 38:30.475
We both feel it.

38:30.517 --> 38:31.703
I don't even know your movies.

38:31.727 --> 38:33.979
- They're films, they're films.
- But my husband,

38:34.021 --> 38:37.065
I called him and told him
that I met you.

38:37.107 --> 38:40.902
- He's a big fan.
- Yeah? Huh.

38:40.944 --> 38:44.031
How big?

38:56.460 --> 39:00.130
What is that,
what-what-what you just said?

39:00.172 --> 39:02.716
Oh, just-just a little prayer,
you know.

39:02.758 --> 39:05.469
"Fear not.
Be strong and courageous."

39:05.510 --> 39:07.387
You know, all that good stuff.

39:07.429 --> 39:09.890
Yeah, nothing like a pep talk
from the Torah

39:09.931 --> 39:12.142
- to help you commit a felony.
- Oh.

39:12.184 --> 39:14.186
My safta used to say it.

39:16.354 --> 39:19.858
Cutting it close.
Did you get the mold?

39:19.900 --> 39:21.485
Yeah,

39:21.526 --> 39:23.028
and possibly gonorrhea.

39:23.070 --> 39:24.237
You okay?

39:24.279 --> 39:27.365
Not emotionally. To get that,
I basically had to

39:27.407 --> 39:30.535
play the kid in a very X-rated
version of Kramer vs. Kramer.

39:30.577 --> 39:32.245
Have a coffee, Romeo.

39:32.287 --> 39:35.207
- Your day's just beginning.
- I don't ever want that back.

39:35.248 --> 39:38.293
All right,
let's carve some keys.

39:38.335 --> 39:40.545
Helen? You ready?

39:40.587 --> 39:42.964
Ja.

39:44.841 --> 39:46.927
It's the best I could make.

39:49.721 --> 39:51.681
It's perfect.

39:55.852 --> 39:57.020
Remember...

39:57.062 --> 40:00.398
You believe it, they believe it.

40:00.440 --> 40:02.400
Drive straight through.

40:23.547 --> 40:25.298
Helen...

40:29.094 --> 40:31.263
Will you...?

40:31.304 --> 40:32.597
We have to go, now.

40:33.807 --> 40:36.226
I'll ask you in a moment.

40:39.855 --> 40:42.190
Halt!

40:42.232 --> 40:43.316
What is this?!

40:43.358 --> 40:44.151
Jakob!

40:44.192 --> 40:46.153
Go! Now!

40:46.194 --> 40:47.279
Jakob!

40:55.829 --> 40:57.539
Stop them!

41:00.041 --> 41:01.626
Open the gate!

41:01.668 --> 41:03.170
Right now!

41:29.362 --> 41:31.448
Colonel,

41:31.489 --> 41:33.742
the compensation for Maryanne's
family is prepared.

41:37.162 --> 41:38.914
I just have...

41:38.955 --> 41:40.790
President Carter
has decided to delay

41:40.832 --> 41:42.626
the signing of the
South American Trade Bill.

41:42.667 --> 41:44.544
The bill, which passed
by a slim margin

41:44.586 --> 41:46.671
in the Senate last week,
would have lifted

41:46.713 --> 41:49.925
sanctions against several
countries. In local news...

41:49.966 --> 41:51.426
She's gonna kill him...

41:51.468 --> 41:53.303
appears to be imminent
in the case of...

41:55.931 --> 41:57.682
Uh-huh?

41:57.724 --> 41:59.309
What did you do?

41:59.351 --> 42:02.562
Oh, nothing
that can't be undone.

42:02.604 --> 42:05.565
As soon as she remembers
how valuable I am

42:05.607 --> 42:07.776
to this organization.

42:10.946 --> 42:12.948
Uh, you know what?

42:12.989 --> 42:16.785
Let it ring.

42:16.826 --> 42:19.537
Everything else can wait.

42:19.579 --> 42:20.956
Scheisse!

42:20.997 --> 42:23.833
- Right?
- That is right.

42:23.875 --> 42:28.088
- One day at a time.

43:45.206 --> 43:49.502
Listen, the second,
the instant that door is opened,

43:49.544 --> 43:52.547
the alarm is tripped, the guards
will know they've been breached.

43:52.589 --> 43:54.215
Right now.

43:54.257 --> 43:55.759
There's two guards.

43:55.800 --> 43:59.637
Lonny and I will keep them
occupied for as long as we can.

43:59.679 --> 44:02.098
Whoa. Get back
to the fucking van.

44:02.140 --> 44:03.308
- Joe, I'm...
- Go.

44:03.350 --> 44:06.561
You're just gonna
fuck things up in there.

44:11.608 --> 44:12.877
- Get on the ground now.
- Help, please.

44:12.901 --> 44:14.253
- Now! Get on the ground!
- Please help!

44:14.277 --> 44:16.488
Help me, please!

44:16.529 --> 44:17.989
Open up this vault.

44:18.031 --> 44:20.617
Open up the vault
or I'll shoot this bitch.

44:20.658 --> 44:22.494
Drop your guns,
slide them over here.

44:22.535 --> 44:23.995
So help me, I'll kill her.

44:24.037 --> 44:25.955
Tell that to someone
who gives a shit.

44:25.997 --> 44:29.292
Please, please, please
do as he says, please.

44:29.334 --> 44:30.877
I will kill her!

44:30.919 --> 44:33.797
- I said drop your guns.
- I have the shot.

44:42.222 --> 44:45.308
Oh, he's got the shot, huh?
Look at him, huh?

44:45.350 --> 44:48.019
He can't wait to kill me.
You're just like a real cop.

44:48.061 --> 44:49.646
Huh! Fucking murderers,

44:49.687 --> 44:51.856
and you get away with it
'cause it's your job.

44:51.898 --> 44:54.609
Just like the movies, right?
Huh? Yeah. Attica!

44:54.651 --> 44:56.945
Attica! Attic...

45:00.698 --> 45:02.158
Oh... fuck!

45:07.705 --> 45:10.041
Freeze! Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah.

45:10.083 --> 45:11.376
Drop the fucking gun

45:11.418 --> 45:13.253
or I'll fucking
blow your brains out.

45:13.294 --> 45:15.713
Drop the gun!

45:17.632 --> 45:20.427
Stand up, asshole. Turn around.

45:20.468 --> 45:24.389
Interlace your fingers
behind your head.

45:38.319 --> 45:40.071
Easy.

45:45.577 --> 45:47.120
Fuck.

45:49.747 --> 45:52.333
Guess I didn't fuck up, did I?

45:52.375 --> 45:53.918
Come on.

45:56.754 --> 45:59.090
It's here.

46:00.967 --> 46:02.886
Wait, what...

46:04.137 --> 46:06.139
What?

46:09.392 --> 46:12.312
Bubkes.

46:12.353 --> 46:15.064
Fucker's dead. Careful.
The bitch is in on it.

46:20.653 --> 46:22.363
Bitch sure is.

46:35.835 --> 46:39.005
Ghost bullets, I presume.

46:41.090 --> 46:43.218
Oh, shit!

46:43.259 --> 46:45.678
Mine are the real kind.

46:52.685 --> 46:54.687
Get up.

46:56.731 --> 46:58.566
Oh, for fuck's sake.

46:59.817 --> 47:01.861
And scene.

47:05.281 --> 47:06.866
Thank you.

47:06.908 --> 47:08.368
Thank you so much.

47:08.409 --> 47:11.120
Now kindly

47:11.162 --> 47:12.956
point us to the fucking money.

47:12.997 --> 47:16.918
- All right, guys.
- What the fuck do we do now?

47:16.960 --> 47:20.046
I don't know. I mean, this key,
this box, all a dead end.

47:20.088 --> 47:21.464
There's nothing here.

47:22.507 --> 47:24.092
This room isn't big enough.

47:24.133 --> 47:26.386
Huh?
- The dimensions
in the blueprints,

47:26.427 --> 47:28.555
it's smaller than
it should be. It...

47:32.267 --> 47:35.353
Just by a few feet,
but still, it's-it's this wall.

47:35.395 --> 47:38.940
- It's-it's, i-it's too close.
- What are you saying?

47:38.982 --> 47:40.858
He's saying this wall
isn't a wall.

47:40.900 --> 47:43.319
There's something behind it.

47:51.536 --> 47:53.871
What?

48:02.213 --> 48:04.215
But according to the plans,

48:04.257 --> 48:06.884
this building doesn't
have a basement.

48:06.926 --> 48:09.178
- But it does now.
- So,

48:09.220 --> 48:13.016
Joe, after you?

48:35.705 --> 48:39.208
Please tell me
this isn't what I think it is.

49:16.079 --> 49:20.041
Meyer said that Hauser helped
to hide the Nazi loot

49:20.083 --> 49:22.085
stolen from Jews during the war.

49:22.126 --> 49:25.755
I, I didn't think
he, he meant this.

49:27.757 --> 49:31.344
This is... this is...

49:31.386 --> 49:33.221
Everything.

49:34.597 --> 49:36.891
Down to their jewelry.

49:39.143 --> 49:42.814
M-Mindy and I, we were there
when they took it all from us.

49:42.855 --> 49:45.858
You know, they had
to put it somewhere.

49:52.156 --> 49:54.867
How many lives do you think
are in this room?

49:54.909 --> 49:58.496
He knew this was happening
and did nothing.

49:58.538 --> 50:02.375
He didn't do nothing.
He built himself a big old bank.

50:16.723 --> 50:20.518
That's just like Aaron's.

50:25.022 --> 50:27.191
Every piece,

50:27.233 --> 50:30.653
every single token, has a story.

50:44.834 --> 50:46.711
♪ ♪

51:02.852 --> 51:05.813
Guys. It's time.

51:05.855 --> 51:09.609
- We got to go.
- No, no, we...

51:09.650 --> 51:11.527
We can't leave this here.

51:11.569 --> 51:14.947
We have to.
No footprints, remember?

51:14.989 --> 51:16.991
We'll lose our lead.

51:18.159 --> 51:22.079
Write for yourselves this song.

51:22.121 --> 51:24.040
I got another idea.

51:28.294 --> 51:31.130
What?

51:31.172 --> 51:32.340
Okay.

51:33.800 --> 51:36.761
- Sorry. We do need to go.
- Yeah.

51:36.803 --> 51:39.430
- Okay.
- Mindy.

51:40.556 --> 51:44.268
- M-Mindy.
- Jonah?

51:45.186 --> 51:46.270
- Mindy.
- Yeah.

51:46.312 --> 51:49.106
Okay, Jonah.

51:49.148 --> 51:51.776
Jonah. We got to go.

51:51.818 --> 51:53.402
We're exiting.

51:53.444 --> 51:55.780
Copy. We'll meet you outside.

52:01.077 --> 52:03.120
Thanks, fellas.

52:05.122 --> 52:06.749
This is why you came,

52:06.791 --> 52:09.293
like the others,

52:09.335 --> 52:12.588
to hurl baseless accusations
without proof?

52:12.630 --> 52:15.800
I came with the proof...

52:19.428 --> 52:21.639
of the fortunes you plundered

52:21.681 --> 52:24.141
from millions of dead Jews,

52:24.183 --> 52:26.811
that you now have hidden

52:26.853 --> 52:29.897
beneath your bank.

52:31.941 --> 52:36.737
The innocent souls
that perished in agony

52:36.779 --> 52:39.574
while you looked the other way.

52:40.533 --> 52:44.328
Then raked in
what was left of them.

52:44.370 --> 52:47.123
Their rings,

52:47.164 --> 52:50.793
their rattles, their teeth.

52:50.835 --> 52:53.421
Look at them. Here.

52:55.590 --> 52:58.801
Photographs can be doctored.

52:58.843 --> 53:00.720
Doctored?

53:01.846 --> 53:04.223
Oh, yes.

53:06.309 --> 53:09.145
Can you doctor this?

53:11.606 --> 53:13.608
Look at it.

53:13.649 --> 53:17.194
- Can you doctor this?
- I have seen enough, sir.

53:17.236 --> 53:19.697
Now I will go.

53:23.242 --> 53:26.162
Quiet, quiet. Quiet.

53:26.203 --> 53:27.580
Quiet.

53:27.622 --> 53:29.916
It's your life if you're quiet.

53:29.957 --> 53:33.210
Do you understand?
Just listen to me.

53:33.252 --> 53:37.965
Next, these photos go
to the war crimes tribunal.

53:38.007 --> 53:41.177
Then to the victims' families.

53:41.218 --> 53:45.681
Then to the Nazi pigs whose
troughs you failed to protect.

53:45.723 --> 53:47.725
What do you want to know?

53:47.767 --> 53:50.728
Who owns box 630?

53:50.770 --> 53:53.397
That's all. Tell me.

53:53.439 --> 53:57.193
I will leave your vile history
right where it is,

53:57.234 --> 53:58.945
in the past.

53:58.986 --> 54:02.615
If I tell you, he will kill me.

54:02.657 --> 54:05.701
Don't let him know you told me.
That's all.

54:05.743 --> 54:08.454
You can keep a secret,
can't you?

54:08.496 --> 54:09.872
- Can't you?
- Yes.

54:09.914 --> 54:12.249
All right.

54:13.960 --> 54:15.962
You tell me.

54:17.546 --> 54:19.924
Tell me.

54:22.551 --> 54:26.931
Oskar Hauptman.

54:29.934 --> 54:31.811
- Try again.
- Oskar...

54:31.852 --> 54:35.106
- Hauptman.
- Hauptman died 30 years ago.

54:35.147 --> 54:36.565
No, no...

54:36.607 --> 54:38.776
- You think I don't know this?
- No, no, no, no.

54:38.818 --> 54:40.444
- What?
- Hauptman,

54:40.486 --> 54:44.073
he's still alive, Jew.

54:48.828 --> 54:50.621
Thank you.

55:20.109 --> 55:22.486
I love you, Maria.

55:24.989 --> 55:29.285
When the time is right,
we can get the rest.

55:29.326 --> 55:33.581
But until we find its home,

55:33.622 --> 55:38.210
consider it a reminder
of your birthright.

55:43.883 --> 55:47.678
What we did to Holstedder,

55:47.720 --> 55:49.722
it felt wrong.

55:51.891 --> 55:55.061
It felt like it wasn't
my problem, 'cause,

55:55.102 --> 55:56.937
you know, it didn't affect me.

56:00.316 --> 56:03.861
- When I saw that room...
- Yeah, when you saw that room,

56:03.903 --> 56:06.572
you realized what it is
we're doing here.

56:08.407 --> 56:12.161
That ring belonged to someone

56:12.203 --> 56:15.206
who lived, who dreamed.

56:15.247 --> 56:19.126
One moment alive,
one moment... gone.

56:19.168 --> 56:20.336
No more.

56:21.378 --> 56:23.881
And it was one ring

56:23.923 --> 56:26.801
in one room.

56:26.842 --> 56:30.429
Imagine how many
other stories there are.

56:30.471 --> 56:32.848
Imagine.

56:33.891 --> 56:37.061
You're one of us now.

56:37.103 --> 56:40.356
It's so good to have you here.

56:40.397 --> 56:42.566
- My boy...
- Ah...

56:42.608 --> 56:45.194
- Eh.
- It's just a little...

56:45.236 --> 56:46.403
- I know.
- Tender.

56:46.445 --> 56:49.990
I need to learn how to fight
fucking Bruce Lee-style.

56:50.032 --> 56:53.035
Well, I'll see what I can do.

56:53.077 --> 56:55.704
I know a few people, you know?

56:57.123 --> 57:01.752
But first... here's someone
you should see.

57:03.504 --> 57:06.757
Oskar Hauptman.

57:06.799 --> 57:08.884
The Ghost.

57:08.926 --> 57:12.930
A Nazi doctor so sadistic,

57:12.972 --> 57:15.975
he could make
even Mengele squirm.

57:16.016 --> 57:21.438
It appears
he may still be alive.

57:21.480 --> 57:25.025
And it would be
our job to find him.

57:25.067 --> 57:27.987
The owner of box 630.

57:31.824 --> 57:33.242
Come.

57:33.284 --> 57:35.077
Let's go tell the others.

57:41.667 --> 57:43.252
Hunters,

57:43.294 --> 57:47.131
come meet Oskar Hauptman.

57:58.559 --> 58:01.353
Excuse me.
You're Danny Rohr, right?

58:01.395 --> 58:02.980
No soliciting, thank you.

58:03.022 --> 58:05.399
Millie Morris, FBI.

58:05.441 --> 58:07.401
Can I ask you a question?

58:07.443 --> 58:09.612
Journalism 101 tip:

58:09.653 --> 58:11.715
never waste a question asking
if you can ask a question.

58:11.739 --> 58:15.159
You wrote a few puff pieces
on Meyer Offerman.

58:15.201 --> 58:16.469
You even quoted him
in a real article

58:16.493 --> 58:18.495
about Jewish philanthropy.

58:18.537 --> 58:20.539
I called the Times.
They said you lost your job.

58:20.581 --> 58:22.875
Look, lady, cartoons start
in 15 minutes.

58:22.917 --> 58:24.895
I'm thinking today's the day
Tom finally gets Jerry.

58:24.919 --> 58:27.129
What do you want?

58:27.171 --> 58:31.592
I want you to tell me everything
you know about Meyer Offerman.

58:31.634 --> 58:34.136
Hi, herzli.

58:34.178 --> 58:37.473
Oh, don't forget we have a
dinner with the Lindts this, uh,

58:37.514 --> 58:40.100
next weekend,
to Peter Luger, huh?

58:40.142 --> 58:42.478
You remember? Good.

58:42.519 --> 58:45.314
All right, my darling.

58:45.356 --> 58:47.274
I love you very much and...

58:47.316 --> 58:49.902
I'll see, I'll see you soon.

58:49.944 --> 58:52.363
All right. Bye-bye.

59:11.006 --> 59:13.008
Oh, my God.
