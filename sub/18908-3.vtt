.

00:07.308 --> 00:08.742
- Previously on "Colony"...

00:09.343 --> 00:10.178
- You have been assigned

00:11.045 --> 00:12.180
to one of the Authority's
labor camps

00:12.213 --> 00:13.514
and distribution centers.

00:13.547 --> 00:15.183
- What is this?

00:15.216 --> 00:17.318
Who ordered you
to search my house?

00:17.351 --> 00:20.321
- I've been sent here
because this office has failed

00:20.354 --> 00:23.057
to live up to the standards
of the Authority.

00:23.091 --> 00:25.126
You will get the chance
to prove yourself.

00:25.159 --> 00:26.527
- You need to work for me.

00:26.560 --> 00:29.063
- What?
- I know what you've been doing,

00:29.097 --> 00:30.664
and I have the evidence.

00:30.698 --> 00:33.201
- Hey, don't forget to pick up
Charlie today.

00:33.234 --> 00:35.103
- See you tonight.
- Copy that.

00:35.136 --> 00:36.770
- I couldn't get Charlie.
- I'll go get him.

00:36.804 --> 00:38.639
[blasting]

00:40.174 --> 00:42.210
Government found him
in the Santa Monica bloc.

00:42.243 --> 00:44.212
- I want to see Solomon.

00:44.245 --> 00:46.214
- Your son would've starved
on the streets

00:46.247 --> 00:47.481
if it wasn't for me.

00:47.515 --> 00:48.816
- Charlie!

00:52.253 --> 00:53.487
[grunts]
- Okay!

00:53.521 --> 00:55.356
- [grunting]

[indistinct chatter]

01:05.133 --> 01:06.100
- Next up!

01:08.236 --> 01:11.272
- Have your identification
ready!

01:17.678 --> 01:19.213
- Are you signing up
for the Redhats?

01:19.247 --> 01:21.849
- If they'll take me.

01:21.882 --> 01:24.852
- You got any military training
or weapons skills?

01:24.885 --> 01:26.787
- I used to take
cardio kickboxing.

01:26.820 --> 01:27.788
Does that count?

01:27.821 --> 01:29.590
- [laughs]

01:29.623 --> 01:31.525
Well, I hear they're desperate
for more men. They'll--

01:31.559 --> 01:33.261
they'll probably take anyone
they can get.

01:33.294 --> 01:36.130
- Hope you're right.
I could use the extra rations.

01:36.164 --> 01:37.665
- Next ten inside.

01:37.698 --> 01:38.766
- All right, come on,
let's move.

01:38.799 --> 01:40.868
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

01:40.901 --> 01:43.604
- Come on, let's go. Move it.

01:43.637 --> 01:45.239
- Stop there.

this doesn't look good.

03:13.827 --> 03:16.230
- ...gonna hang this on you.

03:16.264 --> 03:18.866
- ...higher-ups,
it's gotta happen now.

03:18.899 --> 03:21.502
- Morning. Your office said
you needed to see me.

03:21.535 --> 03:22.603
Who are those guys?

03:22.636 --> 03:24.372
- Professionals.

03:24.405 --> 03:26.474
This shitshow that I inherited
makes more sense

03:26.507 --> 03:28.376
now that I know
the previous regime was

03:28.409 --> 03:30.344
recruiting from dating websites.

03:30.378 --> 03:32.480
- I was in database
administration.

03:32.513 --> 03:34.248
My skill set includes--

03:34.282 --> 03:36.350
- A career in high-level
counterintelligence?

03:36.384 --> 03:38.519
Former CIA, Operations Division.

03:38.552 --> 03:40.621
Interpol. MI-6.

03:40.654 --> 03:44.392
They've been sent from outside
the bloc to clean up our mess,

03:44.425 --> 03:46.294
which is not just embarrassing--

03:46.327 --> 03:49.530
It might have
serious consequences.

03:49.563 --> 03:52.633
We need to find Broussard
and recover our Host's artifact.

03:52.666 --> 03:56.504
And nothing in your resume
or work so far makes me believe

03:56.537 --> 03:58.539
that you will be useful
in this endeavor.

03:58.572 --> 04:02.376
- Sir, I've been working
in this bloc for six months.

04:02.410 --> 04:04.678
I--I know the history
of the insurgency,

04:04.712 --> 04:05.913
how it's structured.

04:05.946 --> 04:08.316
And I have numerous contacts.

04:08.349 --> 04:10.050
- Don't tell me you're valuable.

04:10.083 --> 04:11.585
Show me.

04:14.622 --> 04:18.025
- Okay. Let's go
through the ten qualities.

04:18.058 --> 04:19.493
- Okay?
- Mm-hmm.

04:19.527 --> 04:21.395
- Number one.

04:21.429 --> 04:23.664
- Obedience.
- Very good.

04:23.697 --> 04:24.998
[phone rings]
Number two?

04:25.032 --> 04:25.999
- Hard work.

04:26.033 --> 04:28.769
[phone ringing]

04:28.802 --> 04:31.605
- Hello?
- Do you want to go shopping?

04:31.639 --> 04:34.442
- Sorry. Who is this?
I can barely hear you.

04:34.475 --> 04:37.511
- I'm the person who knows
all about your old friendships.

04:37.545 --> 04:40.080
There's a swap meet
at MacArthur Park.

04:40.113 --> 04:42.550
For the sake of your family,
meet me there in half an hour.

04:46.354 --> 04:49.923
- Reverence.
- Good job.

04:49.957 --> 04:52.560
- Enlightenment.

04:52.593 --> 04:54.728
- I have to go handle something
at the Yonk.

04:54.762 --> 04:56.864
Can you--
can you watch Gracie?

04:56.897 --> 04:58.399
- Of course, Mrs. Bowman.

04:58.432 --> 04:59.967
May I have a word with you
first?

05:00.000 --> 05:01.068
- Yes. What is it?

05:01.101 --> 05:03.471
- [clears throat]
Um...

05:03.504 --> 05:05.506
I don't understand
why Gracie can't

05:05.539 --> 05:08.342
continue her studies with Hudson
up in the Green Zone.

05:08.376 --> 05:12.413
The change of scenery's been
very distracting.

05:12.446 --> 05:15.483
- I'm fighting with my sister.
- Oh.

05:15.516 --> 05:18.486
Have you tried listening
to Sister Maddie's perspective?

05:18.519 --> 05:20.354
She's been received
into the Greatest Day.

05:20.388 --> 05:21.755
That is a huge honor.

05:23.591 --> 05:25.426
- I will keep that in mind.

05:29.463 --> 05:30.631
I love you.
I'll see you soon.

05:30.664 --> 05:31.965
- Love you. Bye.

05:33.133 --> 05:36.370
- Okay. Where were we?

05:36.404 --> 05:38.672
Let's see.
Oh, yes.

05:48.516 --> 05:50.551
- Um, you hungry?

06:04.432 --> 06:06.667
That's a good idea.

06:06.700 --> 06:08.669
Save it for later.

06:18.145 --> 06:19.880
You want to see something cool?

06:25.486 --> 06:29.089
I got this on duty
three years ago.

06:30.791 --> 06:34.161
Through...

06:34.194 --> 06:35.162
and through.

06:36.997 --> 06:39.533
- You got shot?

06:39.567 --> 06:41.168
- Every scar's a story.

06:41.201 --> 06:43.537
The more you live,
the more you get.

06:44.738 --> 06:46.406
Nothing to be embarrassed about.

06:50.143 --> 06:52.212
- A guy hit me with a board.

06:52.245 --> 06:53.847
It had a nail in it.

06:56.584 --> 06:59.453
- Maybe we tell your dad
you got that one...

06:59.487 --> 07:01.121
walking into a wall
or something.

07:07.160 --> 07:10.163
[tense music]

07:10.197 --> 07:13.166

07:13.200 --> 07:15.168

07:15.202 --> 07:18.205
[grunting]

07:18.238 --> 07:19.773
- Hold him down.
Come on. Grab his boots.

07:19.807 --> 07:21.208
- [shouting]
- Hurry.

07:23.276 --> 07:25.178
- Welcome to the shit, fish.

07:27.047 --> 07:29.717
- [coughs]

07:29.750 --> 07:31.118
[gasps]

07:33.053 --> 07:40.093
*

07:45.633 --> 07:47.535
- You two, over there!

07:47.568 --> 07:50.137
This way.
Take your stations. Let's go.

07:50.170 --> 07:53.807
*

07:53.841 --> 07:55.576
- What happened to your boots,
kid?

07:55.609 --> 07:56.577
[laughs]

07:59.312 --> 08:02.550
[indistinct radio chatter]

08:07.254 --> 08:09.289
- Find anything you like?

08:09.322 --> 08:12.092
- What do you want from me?

08:12.125 --> 08:14.227
- You know what I want.

08:14.261 --> 08:16.664
- I already told you
that I can't give you Broussard.

08:16.697 --> 08:18.198
I don't have any way
to contact him.

08:18.231 --> 08:19.967
- I don't believe that.

08:21.602 --> 08:23.236
I have a new boss.

08:23.270 --> 08:26.306
He's gonna turn over every stone
in this bloc.

08:26.339 --> 08:29.509
The only way to stop him is
to give him what he wants.

08:31.879 --> 08:33.213
I don't want to hand you over,

08:33.246 --> 08:36.083
but if you won't help me,

08:36.116 --> 08:37.918
I don't have a choice.

08:43.156 --> 08:45.659
- There's a bug in Homeland.

08:45.693 --> 08:46.994
- What?

08:47.027 --> 08:49.229
- A tiny drone that looks
like a bee.

08:49.262 --> 08:50.564
That's how they got
all their intelligence

08:50.598 --> 08:52.666
for their operations.

08:52.700 --> 08:54.835
- A bee?
- That's all I can give you.

09:20.928 --> 09:21.061
.

09:21.094 --> 09:23.731
[knocks at door]

09:32.205 --> 09:33.741
- Oh, come in.

09:33.774 --> 09:37.010
- You okay?
- Yeah. I'm all right.

09:37.044 --> 09:40.147
But when these things begin
to take place,

09:40.180 --> 09:43.150
straighten up
and lift up your heads,

09:43.183 --> 09:46.153
for your redemption
is drawing near.

09:46.186 --> 09:49.222
Luke 21:28.

09:49.256 --> 09:53.126
So, how does this verse compare
to the one from the Koran?

09:53.160 --> 09:57.765
Or from the early scriptures
of Hinduism?

09:57.798 --> 10:01.034
- Well,
it's the same basic story.

10:01.068 --> 10:04.772
We, mankind,
will face a great trial.

10:04.805 --> 10:06.774
- Yes. Exactly.

10:06.807 --> 10:09.843
Yet all of these religions
also promise

10:09.877 --> 10:11.745
that we will emerge
from the other side

10:11.779 --> 10:14.381
even stronger
than we were before.

10:14.414 --> 10:18.618
Take, for example, the Buddhist
concept of Nirvana.

10:21.454 --> 10:23.724
Is everything all right, Katie?

10:27.795 --> 10:29.663
- Well, the last year's
been hard.

10:29.697 --> 10:31.799
- [laughs]
No shit.

10:31.832 --> 10:34.802
[both laugh]

10:34.835 --> 10:36.670
- None of us had planned
for this, huh?

10:36.704 --> 10:40.340
- Man plans. The gods laugh.

10:41.942 --> 10:44.144
- [sighs]
You know, I'm--

10:46.113 --> 10:48.849
Everyone responded to this
in their own way, right?

10:51.451 --> 10:53.687
I had to act.

10:53.721 --> 10:56.857
And I think I put my ideals
ahead of my family.

11:00.794 --> 11:04.932
- Admitting our sins
is always difficult.

11:04.965 --> 11:08.268
But taking responsibility
for them is a different matter.

11:08.301 --> 11:10.303
- I'll take responsibility
for everything I've done.

11:10.337 --> 11:12.205
I don't want it
to land on my daughter.

11:12.239 --> 11:13.841
[sniffles]
We're alone.

11:13.874 --> 11:17.945
- You have family in the bloc,
don't you? A sister?

11:17.978 --> 11:19.346
- Ah...

11:20.914 --> 11:23.350
That hasn't been easy either.

11:23.383 --> 11:24.818
- Mm.

11:27.154 --> 11:28.889
It's been my experience

11:28.922 --> 11:31.391
that blood will always rise
to the occasion

11:31.424 --> 11:33.460
if you give it the chance.

11:33.493 --> 11:38.398
You just have to ask yourself
what matters most to you:

11:38.431 --> 11:41.034
your problems or your pride?

11:45.438 --> 11:47.174
- [sighs, laughs]

11:50.310 --> 11:53.313
[indistinct radio chatter]

11:54.915 --> 11:57.484
- This is what you couldn't wait
to show me?

11:57.517 --> 12:00.253
- It'll be the perfect space.

12:00.287 --> 12:02.389
It's much more welcoming
than a church.

12:02.422 --> 12:04.491
Sure, it needs a little TLC,

12:04.524 --> 12:07.294
but imagine purple banners,

12:07.327 --> 12:10.530
artwork on the walls,
modern furniture,

12:10.563 --> 12:13.433
warmer lighting scheme.

12:13.466 --> 12:15.402
- Okay.

12:15.435 --> 12:18.038
You've really committed to this,
haven't you?

12:18.071 --> 12:19.907
- The more worship facilities
we build,

12:19.940 --> 12:22.075
the stronger our influence
will grow.

12:26.246 --> 12:27.781
- I love it.
- Yeah?

12:27.815 --> 12:29.049
- I love it!

12:29.082 --> 12:31.084
And it's only the beginning

12:31.118 --> 12:33.486
of what we're gonna accomplish
together.

12:44.264 --> 12:46.834
- What the hell happened to you?

12:48.435 --> 12:50.337
- I'm fine.

12:50.370 --> 12:52.372
- You don't look fine.

12:52.405 --> 12:55.775
I know who jumped you,
took your boots.

13:00.080 --> 13:03.083
[dark music]

13:03.116 --> 13:09.156
*

13:09.189 --> 13:11.091
- Who?

13:15.863 --> 13:22.870
*

13:22.903 --> 13:25.338
- You can't let him get away
with stealing your shit.

13:25.372 --> 13:27.207
This place will eat you alive.

13:29.176 --> 13:33.813
*

13:39.486 --> 13:41.021
- Hey.

13:41.054 --> 13:43.523
How are you two getting along?

13:43.556 --> 13:45.292
- Thick as thieves.

13:45.325 --> 13:47.494
Did you find
what you were looking for?

13:48.896 --> 13:50.497
- Yeah.

13:51.498 --> 13:52.966
- What happened?

13:53.000 --> 13:56.503
*

13:56.536 --> 13:59.539
- Solomon won't be bothering you
or any of your friends again.

14:07.414 --> 14:09.049
- What the hell
were you thinking?

14:09.082 --> 14:10.918
Solomon has business partners.

14:10.951 --> 14:12.585
As soon as they realize
what's happened,

14:12.619 --> 14:14.554
they're gonna tear apart
this bloc looking for us.

14:14.587 --> 14:16.089
- We'd better go, then.

14:17.257 --> 14:18.625
- Yeah.

14:18.658 --> 14:22.295
And I'm coming with you.

14:22.329 --> 14:24.064
- To L.A.?

14:24.097 --> 14:26.233
- I'm not gonna stick
around here and pay your bills.

14:26.266 --> 14:28.601
You owe me, Bowman.

14:34.274 --> 14:36.043
- All right.

14:36.076 --> 14:38.511
- All right.

14:38.545 --> 14:41.381
- Now we just need to find a way
out of here.

14:41.414 --> 14:44.918
- Any chance the three of us can
pile in your car

14:44.952 --> 14:48.188
and drive through the L.A.
gateway without a transit pass?

14:48.221 --> 14:50.090
- No.

14:50.123 --> 14:52.625
Come on. You got to know another
way out of this bloc.

14:52.659 --> 14:54.962
- We could use a coyote.

14:58.465 --> 15:00.400
- You know one?

15:00.433 --> 15:01.668
- One.

15:01.701 --> 15:04.637
But you're not gonna like it.

15:08.075 --> 15:09.609
[knocking at door]

15:12.145 --> 15:14.547
- Hey. Thanks for coming.

15:14.581 --> 15:16.549
- You said it was important.

15:18.618 --> 15:20.153
- Can we...

15:25.993 --> 15:27.594
Come sit, please.

15:33.333 --> 15:36.436
I want to apologize

15:36.469 --> 15:38.538
for going behind your back
to Nolan.

15:44.611 --> 15:47.180
I'm in trouble, Mad.

15:47.214 --> 15:49.682
I need your help again.

15:51.451 --> 15:53.520
- [sighs]

15:53.553 --> 15:55.122
What's going on?

15:55.155 --> 15:57.991
- Things are getting pretty bad
down here in the flats,

15:58.025 --> 16:02.996
and a woman from Homeland
has been asking questions.

16:03.030 --> 16:04.631
- What kind of questions?

16:07.334 --> 16:09.036
- Will's on the other side
of the Wall,

16:09.069 --> 16:10.570
and Bram's in prison.

16:10.603 --> 16:13.706
And they think
they smell something.

16:13.740 --> 16:16.076
And I think they're gonna come
for me.

16:16.109 --> 16:18.578
- That's ridiculous.
Look, I'll talk to Nolan.

16:18.611 --> 16:20.047
- No, no, no, no.
Don't. Don't.

16:20.080 --> 16:21.714
You found a safe harbor.

16:21.748 --> 16:24.584
I don't want to do anything
to mess that up for you.

16:24.617 --> 16:25.652
I just need to know

16:25.685 --> 16:27.554
that if there's a knock
on my door,

16:27.587 --> 16:29.222
you will look after Gracie.

16:29.256 --> 16:31.324
- Of course I will, Katie.

16:31.358 --> 16:33.726
But nothing's gonna happen
to you.

16:35.628 --> 16:37.197
- Thanks.

17:00.087 --> 17:00.353
.

17:00.387 --> 17:03.256
[knocking]

17:04.057 --> 17:05.225
- I'm friends with Chuck.
Open up.

17:19.439 --> 17:21.641
We need three tickets
out of the bloc.

17:21.674 --> 17:23.376
- Well, what have you got
to trade?

17:27.614 --> 17:31.318
[scoffs]
It's not enough.

17:31.351 --> 17:32.752
- I got a place.

17:32.785 --> 17:35.655
Generator, boarded windows,
escape tunnel,

17:35.688 --> 17:38.358
enough food to last a year,
easy.

17:38.391 --> 17:41.361
I'm talking
about a small fortune here.

17:42.762 --> 17:45.465
- Sounds like paradise.
So, why are you leaving?

17:45.498 --> 17:47.634
- Tired of beach living.

17:47.667 --> 17:49.502
- I want to know how this works.

17:49.536 --> 17:51.404
- Well, you go over the Wall.

17:53.306 --> 17:56.509
There's a low point where the
Wall cuts through the mountains.

17:56.543 --> 17:58.345
It's only
about 150 feet high there.

17:58.378 --> 18:00.147
- How do you do it?

18:00.180 --> 18:01.748
- Well,

18:01.781 --> 18:04.351
my drone here takes a line up,

18:04.384 --> 18:05.718
rigs it around the top.

18:05.752 --> 18:07.520
You climb up one side,
repel down the other.

18:07.554 --> 18:09.189
- Are you serious?

18:09.222 --> 18:10.490
- I didn't say
it was gonna be easy.

18:10.523 --> 18:12.759
Kids have done it before.

18:12.792 --> 18:14.661
Older than him, though.

18:14.694 --> 18:16.396
- What about their drones?

18:16.429 --> 18:17.697
- Well, the top of the Wall's
a dead spot.

18:17.730 --> 18:19.466
They launch from up there,

18:19.499 --> 18:21.434
but their sensors aren't
activated immediately.

18:21.468 --> 18:24.371
You might see them,
but they won't see you.

18:25.438 --> 18:28.275
- All right.
You heard the plan.

18:28.308 --> 18:30.777
Are you okay with it?
- It's just a wall.

18:30.810 --> 18:34.581
- [laughs, claps hands]
That's what I'm talking about.

18:34.614 --> 18:38.117
- All right.
Then we're going home.

18:38.885 --> 18:41.554
[cabinet drawers slamming]

18:44.591 --> 18:46.426
- [sighs]

18:46.459 --> 18:50.463
- Explain to me once again
why we are wasting valuable time

18:50.497 --> 18:51.864
searching our own office.

18:51.898 --> 18:54.334
- My source said we were bugged.

18:54.367 --> 18:55.468
- By a bumblebee.

18:55.502 --> 18:56.736
- He's very reliable.

18:56.769 --> 18:57.737
- Hm.

18:59.239 --> 19:01.441
- Ma'am.
Is this what you meant?

19:05.478 --> 19:07.314
- My office. Now.

19:10.350 --> 19:12.719
Give me your source.

19:12.752 --> 19:15.188
- I don't think
that's a good idea.

19:15.222 --> 19:16.756
He's skittish.

19:16.789 --> 19:20.193
He knows we were bugged,
and he thinks we have leaks,

19:20.227 --> 19:21.594
so he only wants to deal
with me.

19:21.628 --> 19:23.363
- I don't have the time
to figure out

19:23.396 --> 19:25.332
if you actually know
how to run an asset

19:25.365 --> 19:28.268
or if this was
a lucky accident.

19:28.301 --> 19:30.270
Or maybe you gave me this

19:30.303 --> 19:32.772
because it didn't cost you
anything.

19:32.805 --> 19:36.476
So, bring me something
actionable on Broussard

19:36.509 --> 19:37.744
immediately,

19:37.777 --> 19:40.347
or I'm taking over
the operation.

19:40.380 --> 19:42.349
Understand?

19:42.382 --> 19:44.651
- Yes, sir.

19:45.985 --> 19:53.226
*

20:07.274 --> 20:09.376
- Hey.

20:09.409 --> 20:11.378
You took my--

20:11.411 --> 20:12.645
[all shouting at once]

20:12.679 --> 20:14.247
- Get him! Get him!

20:14.281 --> 20:17.250
[overlapping shouts and cheers]

20:28.828 --> 20:31.864
[Taser clicking]

20:31.898 --> 20:33.400
[Lawson groaning]

20:33.433 --> 20:35.001
- Jesus, Jenkins.

20:35.034 --> 20:38.004
Are you running a labor camp
or "The Octagon"?

20:38.037 --> 20:40.273
- Security is my responsibility,

20:40.307 --> 20:41.674
and I was handling
the situation.

20:41.708 --> 20:43.743
- Yeah. You clearly had it
under control.

20:47.680 --> 20:49.816
One of the reasons
they sent me here was

20:49.849 --> 20:51.984
to lower
the prisoner attrition rate.

20:52.018 --> 20:56.956
If it doesn't fall, maybe I'll
explain your methods to them.

20:59.426 --> 21:06.466
*

21:09.569 --> 21:11.304
- What is that?

21:11.338 --> 21:15.041
- This is a Bible.

21:15.074 --> 21:16.743
And this is a Koran.

21:18.378 --> 21:21.981
And this is the works
of Confucius.

21:23.683 --> 21:27.987
And one of the volumes of the
Buddhist Tipitaka.

21:28.020 --> 21:29.522
- [laughs]

21:30.423 --> 21:32.559
- It's a funny word.

21:32.592 --> 21:37.464
Now, I know that Lindsey has
taught you

21:37.497 --> 21:41.534
that what other people believe
is bad.

21:42.602 --> 21:45.538
But there is
absolutely nothing bad

21:45.572 --> 21:47.474
about thinking for yourself.

21:47.507 --> 21:49.542
Yeah?

21:52.144 --> 21:55.014
Tell me something.
What is your favorite thing

21:55.047 --> 21:57.517
that you've learned
from the Greatest Day?

22:02.422 --> 22:04.791
- I like
how after the Greatest Day,

22:04.824 --> 22:06.926
people won't die anymore.

22:06.959 --> 22:08.428
- Hm.

22:10.430 --> 22:11.498
Sure.

22:11.531 --> 22:12.932
Okay.

22:12.965 --> 22:15.101
Well, did you know
that there are stories

22:15.134 --> 22:17.470
just like that

22:17.504 --> 22:19.672
in every one of these books?

22:19.706 --> 22:20.973
- There are?

22:21.007 --> 22:23.009
- Mm-hmm. There are.

22:23.042 --> 22:26.012
So, how about
we read some of them

22:26.045 --> 22:28.014
and we talk about them together?

22:30.517 --> 22:32.652
- Lindsey would be mad.

22:32.685 --> 22:34.887
- This is
just between you and me.

22:34.921 --> 22:37.957
Lindsey's not gonna know.

22:37.990 --> 22:39.559
I promise.

22:41.060 --> 22:42.429
- Okay.

22:43.696 --> 22:46.065
- All right.

22:46.098 --> 22:48.435
Got one picked out.

22:49.802 --> 22:56.843
*

23:07.520 --> 23:09.422
- The Green Zone border fence is
just up the hill from here.

23:09.456 --> 23:10.790
Maybe ten minutes.

23:10.823 --> 23:12.792
Keep your eyes peeled.
Stick together.

23:12.825 --> 23:14.427
Let's go.

23:14.461 --> 23:17.430
- You good? I can get your bag.
- I got it.

23:17.464 --> 23:19.098
- Tough kid.

23:19.131 --> 23:20.433
- I don't know
where he gets it.

23:20.467 --> 23:22.802
- From his mom, probably.

23:22.835 --> 23:24.571
So, what's going on
with you and Katie?

23:24.604 --> 23:26.005
- Nothing.
- Bullshit.

23:26.038 --> 23:29.576
Since you got here, you haven't
even mentioned her name.

23:29.609 --> 23:30.943
- She got involved...

23:30.977 --> 23:33.446
- With--
- The Resistance.

23:33.480 --> 23:35.715
- [scoffs] Did you really expect
Katie Bowman

23:35.748 --> 23:37.717
to sit around the house
and do nothing

23:37.750 --> 23:39.852
while the rest of the world
turned to shit?

23:39.886 --> 23:43.756
- Course not, but she didn't
have to lie to me,

23:43.790 --> 23:44.957
manipulate me,

23:44.991 --> 23:46.993
put our whole family in danger.

23:47.026 --> 23:50.463
It's just
getting my family back together

23:50.497 --> 23:53.132
felt like the one thing
I could control.

23:53.165 --> 23:56.603
Maybe we couldn't beat the RAPs,
but at least I could do that.

23:56.636 --> 23:58.104
- And now?

23:59.872 --> 24:01.474
- I don't know
what's waiting for me

24:01.508 --> 24:03.242
on the other side of that wall.

24:03.275 --> 24:06.078
- Are you kidding?
The rest of your life.

24:07.914 --> 24:10.950
[dramatic music]

24:20.192 --> 24:20.660
.

24:20.693 --> 24:22.929
- I liked those stories we read,

24:24.130 --> 24:25.632
especially about the fish
who got too big for the pond.

24:25.665 --> 24:27.667
- That's a really good one.

24:32.939 --> 24:35.074
- You don't believe
in the Greatest Day, do you?

24:41.047 --> 24:43.149
- No.

24:43.182 --> 24:44.684
I don't.

24:45.685 --> 24:48.821
Does that make you sad?

24:48.855 --> 24:50.890
- Lindsey says you have
to believe in the Greatest Day

24:50.923 --> 24:52.091
to be a part of it.

24:54.126 --> 24:56.596
I just don't want you to be
left behind.

24:56.629 --> 24:57.897
- [sighs, laughs]

24:57.930 --> 25:00.633
I know what Lindsey says.

25:00.667 --> 25:02.268
She's just a girl, love.

25:02.301 --> 25:04.303
She doesn't have
all the answers.

25:04.336 --> 25:06.539
And neither do I.

25:06.573 --> 25:10.543
You know, you--
you have to ask questions,

25:10.577 --> 25:12.579
and you have to trust
your heart.

25:14.614 --> 25:16.683
No one can tell you
what to believe.

25:16.716 --> 25:20.553
You get to decide that
all by yourself.

25:20.587 --> 25:23.189
And look, you're--
you're gonna make mistakes.

25:23.222 --> 25:25.224
That's how you learn.
We all do.

25:26.626 --> 25:28.127
- Even you?

25:30.196 --> 25:32.565
- I've made lots of mistakes.

25:35.367 --> 25:39.338
What do you think about--

25:39.371 --> 25:41.708
about spending a little more
time up in the Green Zone

25:41.741 --> 25:44.811
with your aunt and your cousin?

25:44.844 --> 25:46.813
- Like when Daddy left
to find Charlie?

25:46.846 --> 25:49.716
- Yeah. Yeah, just like that.
[sniffles]

25:49.749 --> 25:51.584
- You and me this time, right?

25:53.019 --> 25:55.121
- You know, it's a big house,
and they've got

25:55.154 --> 25:57.023
everything you need.
[voice shaking]

25:59.726 --> 26:01.994
- Mom...

26:02.028 --> 26:03.029
what's wrong?

26:03.062 --> 26:04.563
- Nothing, love.

26:07.333 --> 26:09.902
- Are you worried
about Daddy and Charlie?

26:13.806 --> 26:17.243
- Am I worried? No.
[sniffling]

26:17.276 --> 26:20.379
No, because I believe

26:20.412 --> 26:23.650
that your dad's gonna
find Charlie,

26:23.683 --> 26:25.217
and he's gonna take good care
of him.

26:25.251 --> 26:27.654
And you don't need to worry
about that.

26:29.055 --> 26:32.291
What I want you to know

26:32.324 --> 26:34.060
is that
I will always love you,

26:34.093 --> 26:35.762
no matter what.

26:35.795 --> 26:37.263
Yeah.

26:37.296 --> 26:40.366
I'm always right there,
in your heart.

26:40.399 --> 26:42.301
[sniffles]
Okay?

26:45.805 --> 26:47.774
- Can we read another story?

26:47.807 --> 26:50.276
- [laughs]
Of course. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

26:50.309 --> 26:52.144
Go get a book. Go get a book.

27:03.389 --> 27:08.661
*

27:22.174 --> 27:27.079
- Mom, Bram, and Gracie--

27:27.113 --> 27:31.250
are...

27:31.283 --> 27:33.853
they alive?

27:33.886 --> 27:38.024
- They're--they're fine.

27:38.057 --> 27:40.226
They can't wait
to have you home.

27:44.363 --> 27:46.365
- Why didn't you pick me up?

27:49.268 --> 27:56.275
*

28:06.285 --> 28:13.325
*

28:19.298 --> 28:21.367
[phone rings]

28:24.503 --> 28:26.405
- [whispers]
It's okay.

28:26.438 --> 28:28.875
It's okay. Hello?

28:28.908 --> 28:31.410
- We fumigated our office
like you suggested,

28:31.443 --> 28:35.214
but I talked to my boss--
it's not enough.

28:35.247 --> 28:37.049
I can't hold them off anymore.

28:41.821 --> 28:43.756
- I'm ready to give you
what you want.

28:54.200 --> 28:54.466
.

28:54.500 --> 28:56.335
[knocking at door]
- Yes?

28:57.069 --> 28:57.403
- I just talked to my source.

28:58.037 --> 28:59.205
He's giving us Broussard.

28:59.238 --> 29:01.440
- When?
- Tomorrow.

29:06.112 --> 29:09.148
- Maybe you're not
quite as ill-suited for this job

29:09.181 --> 29:10.316
as I thought.

29:12.251 --> 29:13.752
Don't screw it up.

29:16.522 --> 29:19.758
[water dripping]

29:23.529 --> 29:25.331
[gate slides open]

29:26.298 --> 29:33.039
*

29:33.072 --> 29:34.473
- Where are you taking me?

29:43.415 --> 29:44.450
[door opens]

29:44.483 --> 29:46.118
[footsteps approach]

29:54.927 --> 29:56.528
- [snaps fingers]
Get out of here.

30:01.000 --> 30:03.002
You're Will Bowman's other son.

30:03.035 --> 30:06.873
I knew your name at some point,
but I'm afraid it's gone.

30:06.906 --> 30:09.175
- Bram.
- That's right.

30:09.208 --> 30:11.043
Like the guy who wrote
"Jekyll and Hyde."

30:12.478 --> 30:14.413
- "Dracula."

30:14.446 --> 30:16.415
- I see you have
a bit of your father in you.

30:16.448 --> 30:18.617
Not afraid to come into a man's
office and correct him.

30:18.650 --> 30:21.487
Come on. Sit. Eat.

30:33.432 --> 30:37.036
So, they caught you going
under the Wall.

30:37.069 --> 30:40.106
What did you see there?

30:40.139 --> 30:42.374
- Nothing. It was empty.

30:42.408 --> 30:44.243
- Then you got lucky.

30:52.184 --> 30:54.486
- You knew my father.

30:54.520 --> 30:56.488
Please.
I just want to go home.

31:00.927 --> 31:02.261
- So do I.

31:03.662 --> 31:06.565
But I'm afraid
that's gonna take some work

31:06.598 --> 31:09.301
for both of us.

31:09.335 --> 31:12.972
How would you feel
about new boots?

31:14.573 --> 31:16.108
- You trying to get me killed?

31:17.609 --> 31:20.379
- That's a fair point.

31:20.412 --> 31:22.448
You're a bit more street smart
than you look.

31:22.481 --> 31:24.450
- What do you want?

31:24.483 --> 31:26.452
- Our Neanderthal
head of security

31:26.485 --> 31:28.220
is too dumb to see it,

31:28.254 --> 31:30.589
but rebellion is brewing
in this camp.

31:30.622 --> 31:32.324
For example,
the fights always break out

31:32.358 --> 31:33.625
in the loading dock.

31:33.659 --> 31:36.996
Never the bunks or the bathroom
never the mess hall.

31:37.029 --> 31:38.464
The loading dock.

31:38.497 --> 31:40.232
Why do you think that is?

31:41.968 --> 31:43.602
- Because they're stealing
stuff.

31:43.635 --> 31:45.271
- You're a fast learner.

31:45.304 --> 31:47.073
Runs in the family, I guess.

31:47.106 --> 31:49.641
Like I said,
I want to get out of here too,

31:49.675 --> 31:52.478
and that's not happening
unless I run a clean camp.

31:52.511 --> 31:55.647
No stealing,
no resistance,

31:55.681 --> 31:57.349
no nonsense.

31:57.383 --> 32:01.487
But I can't do that
without information.

32:01.520 --> 32:03.489
- You want me to be your spy.

32:15.434 --> 32:18.637
If I help you,
I get to go home?

32:18.670 --> 32:21.507
- Do you know
where your father is?

32:21.540 --> 32:23.642
- My mom told me he went through
the Wall to look for Charlie.

32:23.675 --> 32:28.247
- Because I got him
a transit pass.

32:28.280 --> 32:32.184
You see, you can trust me
to keep my deals.

32:38.524 --> 32:39.691
- Okay.

32:49.535 --> 32:52.538
[dramatic music]

32:52.571 --> 32:59.578
*

33:03.682 --> 33:05.717
- All right, everybody back.
She's hot.

33:12.358 --> 33:15.394
[whirring]

33:27.206 --> 33:30.209
All right, we're rigged.

33:30.242 --> 33:31.610
Better get climbing.

33:33.245 --> 33:34.446
- Okay.

33:34.480 --> 33:36.282
Remember,

33:36.315 --> 33:39.385
unclip, clip,
every knot.

33:39.418 --> 33:41.220
- Unclip, clip,
every knot.

33:41.253 --> 33:42.554
- All right.

33:43.589 --> 33:45.124
Let's see what you got now.

33:51.630 --> 33:53.165
I've climbed worse than this.

33:53.199 --> 33:54.633
I'll be right behind you.

33:54.666 --> 33:56.135
- I'm not scared.

33:57.769 --> 33:59.538
- I know.

33:59.571 --> 34:01.640
- Hey, come on. [claps hands]
You guys got to get going.

34:01.673 --> 34:03.509
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.
- Lead the way.

34:03.542 --> 34:04.776
- Thanks.

34:06.245 --> 34:13.252
*

34:19.525 --> 34:20.859
[carabiner clipping]

34:20.892 --> 34:22.494
- [grunts]

34:23.595 --> 34:27.633
*

34:27.666 --> 34:30.636
- Hey. Nothing to see down here.

34:30.669 --> 34:32.538
Eyes straight ahead, okay?

34:32.571 --> 34:34.406
- Okay.
- Okay. Let's keep going.

34:42.814 --> 34:49.821
*

34:52.524 --> 34:53.792
- [grunts]

35:01.600 --> 35:03.335
Oh--Dad!

35:03.369 --> 35:04.903
- It's okay. I got it.

35:04.936 --> 35:07.273
Stay put. I'm coming.

35:07.306 --> 35:09.275
[grunts]

35:09.308 --> 35:10.876
- Hang on, Charlie!

35:10.909 --> 35:12.911
- All right. Grab this one.

35:12.944 --> 35:15.614
You're all right.

35:15.647 --> 35:17.183
You're doing great.

35:17.216 --> 35:18.417
You got it.

35:20.586 --> 35:22.488
[carabiners clipping]

35:22.521 --> 35:25.424
- Come on, Charlie.
We're almost home.

35:26.392 --> 35:27.659
- Wait.

35:27.693 --> 35:30.662
[drone whirring]

35:47.279 --> 35:49.281
Move! Move! We got to move!

35:54.786 --> 35:56.555
[grunts]

35:56.588 --> 35:59.891
[breathing heavily]

35:59.925 --> 36:02.294
- Come on, Will. Let's go--

36:04.730 --> 36:06.498
- Devon!

36:06.532 --> 36:08.400
[both breathing heavily]

36:08.434 --> 36:10.236
It's okay, buddy.

36:10.269 --> 36:11.603
I love you, bud.

36:11.637 --> 36:12.604
[drone whirring]

36:12.638 --> 36:14.406
It's okay.

36:14.440 --> 36:21.413
*

36:56.782 --> 36:56.915
.

36:56.948 --> 36:58.917
- New boots.

36:59.385 --> 37:00.452
Don't lose 'em.

37:05.857 --> 37:08.994
- That freak didn't take
my boots.

37:09.027 --> 37:10.662
I wear 10 1/2.

37:10.696 --> 37:11.963
He's what? A 16?

37:15.734 --> 37:17.536
That was set up.

37:17.569 --> 37:19.805
You sent me to get my ass kicked
there for a reason.

37:19.838 --> 37:22.641
- Yeah.

37:22.674 --> 37:25.644
Sorry about that.

37:25.677 --> 37:27.813
- I want to know why.

37:36.522 --> 37:39.558
[children chattering]

37:53.104 --> 37:54.640
- You have kids?

37:54.673 --> 37:57.909
- Nope.
A pair of nieces in Texas.

37:57.943 --> 38:00.045
Or they...were.

38:00.078 --> 38:02.013
- Sure.

38:02.047 --> 38:04.383
- [clears throat]
I meant what I said.

38:04.416 --> 38:07.353
You're out of time.
You need to deliver.

38:10.856 --> 38:12.891
- I'm gonna take my daughter
up to my sister's place

38:12.924 --> 38:14.560
in the Green Zone.

38:14.593 --> 38:18.330
You can come, if you want.

38:18.364 --> 38:20.766
And then I'll walk into Homeland
with you.

38:23.669 --> 38:25.404
You wanted a body.
You've got me.

38:25.437 --> 38:26.838
- [scoffs]

38:28.407 --> 38:29.741
I need Broussard.

38:29.775 --> 38:31.677
- I told you I cannot get him
for you.

38:31.710 --> 38:32.911
I wasn't lying.

38:38.384 --> 38:41.887
You know, after the Arrival,
I was horrified

38:41.920 --> 38:44.523
by how easily people gave up
their freedom,

38:44.556 --> 38:45.991
without even a real fight,

38:46.024 --> 38:49.828
just to keep some semblance
of their normal life.

38:51.897 --> 38:54.633
Right now, I'd give you anything

38:54.666 --> 38:58.404
for one day with my husband
and my kids in our old house.

39:02.841 --> 39:07.078
I can't live with a sword
hanging over my head.

39:07.112 --> 39:11.650
It's okay.
You can take me in.

39:11.683 --> 39:12.818
Or not.

39:12.851 --> 39:14.420
It's your call.

39:17.188 --> 39:19.925
- You think
that you can manipulate me...

39:19.958 --> 39:22.828
because I'm weak.

39:22.861 --> 39:25.631
- I don't think you're weak.

39:25.664 --> 39:28.934
I--I think you have
a conscience.

39:28.967 --> 39:30.802
- Do you have a conscience?

39:30.836 --> 39:33.639
Do you ever think
of the people

39:33.672 --> 39:37.943
who are dead
because of you?

39:37.976 --> 39:39.445
- Every day.

39:46.818 --> 39:49.821
- It doesn't matter.

39:49.855 --> 39:53.692
I can't stop this anymore.

39:53.725 --> 39:57.829
It's bigger than just me now.

39:57.863 --> 39:59.831
- I won't blame you.

40:02.934 --> 40:04.970
I mean it.

40:05.003 --> 40:06.672
I won't blame you.

40:09.708 --> 40:11.877
Gracie-girl, got to go!

40:13.812 --> 40:15.981
[sighs, sniffles]

40:16.014 --> 40:18.216
- What's going on?
I don't understand.

40:18.249 --> 40:19.985
- It's like we talked about
last night.

40:20.018 --> 40:22.621
You're gonna get to go
up to the Green Zone

40:22.654 --> 40:24.222
with your Auntie Maddie
and with your cousin.

40:24.255 --> 40:25.190
Grab your bag.

40:27.959 --> 40:30.161
- Mom, I don't want to go
to the Green Zone.

40:30.195 --> 40:31.997
I want to stay here with you.

40:32.030 --> 40:35.000
- I know, sweet girl, and I wish
you could stay with me too.

40:36.535 --> 40:39.571
Come here.

40:39.605 --> 40:41.773
I need to know that you're safe.

40:43.575 --> 40:45.844
You have a sweet soul,
my girl.

40:49.014 --> 40:52.150
Trust your heart,
and you'll always be okay.

40:52.183 --> 40:54.185
[clanking from outside]

40:54.219 --> 40:56.021
[footsteps approaching]

40:56.054 --> 40:57.723
- Who is that?

40:57.756 --> 41:00.592
[tense music]

41:01.893 --> 41:04.763
[soft music]

41:04.796 --> 41:05.964
- Charlie!

41:05.997 --> 41:07.866
- Dad?

41:07.899 --> 41:10.268
Charlie. Dad.

41:10.301 --> 41:11.903
- I'm here.

41:11.937 --> 41:13.905
- [laughs]

41:13.939 --> 41:15.907
- God, I missed you.

41:15.941 --> 41:17.643
- [laughing, sobbing]

41:17.676 --> 41:19.778
My boy.

41:19.811 --> 41:21.547
[crying]
