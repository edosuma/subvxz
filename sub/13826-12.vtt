Guh. There's gotta be something nice

00:51.760 --> 00:54.763
to say about this cold, drab, dreary,
and empty place.

00:55.472 --> 00:57.558
Hmm. Though plain and simple,

00:57.641 --> 01:01.436
this cute little planet has tons
of potential, with room to grow!

01:04.898 --> 01:07.067

01:12.698 --> 01:13.949
Also, it talks.

01:14.324 --> 01:15.409
Hello, planet.

01:15.492 --> 01:16.994
I'm Wander. What's your name?

01:17.244 --> 01:19.872
Oh, um, I'm afraid I don't know.
(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)

01:20.038 --> 01:21.456
I've never needed a name before.

01:22.124 --> 01:24.668
I do believe I've always
liked the name "Janet."

01:24.835 --> 01:27.045
Nice to meet you, Planet Janet.

01:27.504 --> 01:30.465
JANET: Oh, and I'm ever so delighted
to meet you, Wander,

01:30.549 --> 01:32.426
Oh, please forgive my ghastly appearance.

01:32.509 --> 01:35.262
If I knew someone was coming,
I would have gussied up a bit.

01:35.512 --> 01:36.722
Though why would I even bother?

01:37.014 --> 01:38.682
It's not like I've had any visitors.

01:38.765 --> 01:39.766
Ever.

01:42.352 --> 01:44.563
Well, that is some sort of shame.

01:44.730 --> 01:46.356
Those folks don't know
what they're missing.

01:46.607 --> 01:48.483
Oh, Wander. (CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

01:48.942 --> 01:50.819
I'd tell ya, in all our travels,

01:50.944 --> 01:53.697
we've never once
come across a talking planet.

(SCOFFS)

01:55.240 --> 01:56.325
"We"?

01:56.408 --> 01:59.995
Well, buddy, I have been all over
this cold, drab, dreary and empty place,

02:00.120 --> 02:02.581
and all I can say is "boring."

02:02.789 --> 02:03.957
Come on, let's get out of here.

02:09.087 --> 02:11.548
Janet, this is Sylvia, my best pal.

02:11.798 --> 02:14.760
There isn't a mountain too high,
a valley too low,

02:14.843 --> 02:16.845
or a river too wide to keep apart

02:16.929 --> 02:18.597
a pair of pals like she and I.

02:20.265 --> 02:22.476

Now...

03:49.104 --> 03:50.105
Look... See...

03:50.439 --> 03:55.194
Uh, hey. So, Janet, you think I could get
a boost or something?

JANET (SWEETLY)
So, Wander, what do you think? (CHUCKLES)

04:07.789 --> 04:11.084
Janet, I have seen a lot of sunsets
in my travels.

04:11.418 --> 04:15.672
But yours takes the cake,
the icing and the cherry on top.

04:15.756 --> 04:19.676
JANET: Oh, Wander, hearing you say that
melts my already molten core.

04:20.052 --> 04:21.261
Here, have another.

04:21.929 --> 04:23.180
-Wow!
-JANET: And another.

04:24.139 --> 04:25.224
-Amazing!
-JANET: And another.

04:26.058 --> 04:27.100
Incredible.

04:30.687 --> 04:33.899
Ooh, Sylvia.
Have you ever seen anything like it?

04:34.525 --> 04:36.318
No. No, I haven't.

04:37.194 --> 04:38.195
(RUMBLING)

04:39.029 --> 04:40.906
Ew. Sylvia.
Watch out for that bush.

04:41.073 --> 04:42.991
I think it's poison jivey.

04:43.700 --> 04:44.701
Of course it is.

04:55.128 --> 04:56.880
JANET: Oh, Wander, I can't tell you

04:56.964 --> 04:59.091
how simply wonderful
it's been to have you here.

04:59.508 --> 05:02.511
You make me feel like
a newly formed celestial body.

05:02.803 --> 05:05.430
Today was like my Big Bang all over again!

05:05.597 --> 05:07.015
Aww... Thanks, Janet.

05:07.099 --> 05:09.351
We had fun today, too. Right, Sylvia?

05:09.476 --> 05:11.562
Oh, is "fun" the word
we're settling on here?

05:12.104 --> 05:13.897
JANET: You know, the fun
doesn't have to end.

05:13.981 --> 05:14.982
You could...

05:15.566 --> 05:16.650
stay.

05:16.984 --> 05:18.527
That's a great idea.

05:18.610 --> 05:20.112
-We'll stay...
-(YELLS) Tonight.

05:20.612 --> 05:24.074

and then tomorrow we really have to go.

What have you done
with Wander?

06:01.987 --> 06:04.615
JANET: Oh, Wander is fine.
He's right where you left him,

06:04.865 --> 06:05.949
give or take a mountain.

06:06.033 --> 06:08.327
Listen, you oversized chunk of carbon!

06:08.410 --> 06:12.039
There isn't a mountain too high,
a valley too low, or a river too wide

06:12.206 --> 06:14.917
to keep apart a pair of pals
like Wander and I.

06:15.667 --> 06:18.629

specific challenge.

whom I love the best! (GIGGLES)

07:06.218 --> 07:08.095
I can't wait for Sylvia to get back.

07:09.012 --> 07:12.933
If there's one thing I know about Sylvia,
it's that exercise makes her hungry.

07:13.684 --> 07:15.769
If there's two things I know about Sylvia,

07:15.853 --> 07:18.188
it's that she loves
having her snout scratched.

07:18.730 --> 07:21.024
If there's three things
I know about Sylvia...

07:21.275 --> 07:22.442
JANET: (YELLS) Enough!

07:22.693 --> 07:25.737
(IN NORMAL VOICE) There will be enough
for Sylvia when she gets back.

07:44.756 --> 07:46.216
That was almost too wide.

07:46.967 --> 07:48.010
Almost.

07:49.553 --> 07:52.014
That was delec-ticious.

and "delicious"?

(GIGGLES) We know each other so well.

07:58.520 --> 08:00.147
I haven't had a meal that good
