04:08.540 --> 04:12.501
Honey, you know how big
and empty this place feels without you.

04:12.960 --> 04:16.672
<I>Look, there's some things going on
right now that will get really complicated.

04:16.755 --> 04:18.257
What's that supposed to mean?

04:18.382 --> 04:21.843
<I>Well, new territories,
Philadelphia, maybe even Cleveland.

04:21.927 --> 04:24.012
When will we start living
like a normal family?

04:24.095 --> 04:26.515
<I>- When will we start fixing this place up?
-Like?

04:26.598 --> 04:28.391
For one thing...

04:28.475 --> 04:32.061
I'd like to walk out of my bedroom
without a serious concussion every day.

04:32.187 --> 04:36.191
<I>-Honey, I told you. It's that heating thing.
- I don't care what it is.

04:36.274 --> 04:39.985
Casey's the only one short enough
to get under it without clobbering himself.

04:41.404 --> 04:42.946
Come on, you guys. Up!

04:43.072 --> 04:44.032
Yeah?

04:49.161 --> 04:52.039
- Stay the hell out of my room!
- That thing's gonna fall off.

04:59.796 --> 05:01.172
Again, Case?

05:04.634 --> 05:06.969
I thought we were all through with that.

05:09.055 --> 05:12.016
Let's get these wet sheets
out of here before Mom sees them.

05:12.140 --> 05:14.768
You ever walk in on me again,
I'll step on your face.

05:14.852 --> 05:15.852
Sorry.

05:17.479 --> 05:19.481
You're sleeping bare-assed now?

05:20.357 --> 05:23.110
Mom would love that. What's this?

05:23.652 --> 05:25.570
It's nothing. Forget it.

05:28.657 --> 05:30.199
Hey, Mom!

05:30.491 --> 05:32.452
Casey wet the bed again!

05:34.620 --> 05:36.539
Hurry up and get dressed.

05:52.845 --> 05:54.973
All right. Check it out.

05:56.100 --> 05:59.227
"Center ring. Showtime, 7:00 p.m."

05:59.561 --> 06:01.562
Be there or be square.

06:01.688 --> 06:06.109
I don't care what you guys do tonight,
but whatever it is, it's gonna be together.

06:07.193 --> 06:10.487
Casey didn't like the circus last year.
Remember, Mom?

06:10.946 --> 06:12.531
It scared him.

06:16.159 --> 06:17.995
That was last year, right, Case?

06:23.458 --> 06:25.501
- Whose bus?
- Mine.

06:26.169 --> 06:27.670
Take a lunch.

06:28.546 --> 06:31.132
- You got practice tonight?
- It's Friday.

06:31.257 --> 06:32.842
Home right after.

06:39.098 --> 06:40.307
Randy...

06:41.350 --> 06:43.769
what's that thing still doing out there?

06:44.561 --> 06:47.314
Mom, it's for Halloween. Give me a break.

06:47.398 --> 06:50.108
Halloween is two weeks away. It's gross.

06:50.651 --> 06:52.444
You know what your problem is, Mom?

06:52.569 --> 06:55.196
- You got no sense of humor.
- Take it down. Now.

07:09.210 --> 07:10.794
Why can't I go with you?

07:10.920 --> 07:14.131
Honey, your Aunt Mia's 75 years old.
You'd be bored stiff.

07:14.257 --> 07:16.675
- She doesn't like us anyway.
- She doesn't?

07:16.758 --> 07:19.428
She said boys
were made for the chopping block.

07:20.262 --> 07:24.307
Casey, you want to tell me
why you really don't want to go tonight?

07:25.850 --> 07:27.269
Are you sure?

07:53.001 --> 07:56.295
- I'm sitting with Marci, got it?
- Thought you didn't like her anymore.

07:56.421 --> 08:00.091
- She'll be there with Melissa, peewee.
- We can sit alone. We don't care.

08:00.216 --> 08:02.802
Right, have little bawl-baby here
fink on me later?

08:02.927 --> 08:05.262
No way. We can all sit together.

08:05.763 --> 08:07.515
We can all hold hands.

08:09.183 --> 08:11.602
I'll bet you'll need someone
to hold your hand.

08:11.686 --> 08:14.145
I'm not afraid of the stupid circus,
so, shut up.

08:14.271 --> 08:16.315
- Maybe not all of it.
- Lighten up!

08:16.440 --> 08:18.442
Maybe not the lions, Casey?

08:18.942 --> 08:20.652
- Or the elephants.
- Shut up.

08:20.777 --> 08:23.905
Or the fat lady, the strong man.

08:24.156 --> 08:26.658
- Just shut up.
- But, Case...

08:27.367 --> 08:30.953
But what about those clowns?

08:31.621 --> 08:34.582
You think I'll ever forget you running
from that stupid clown?

08:34.664 --> 08:36.876
- No one's ever going to forget.
- Knock it off!

08:37.000 --> 08:39.962
- That was hilarious.
- I was just a little kid.

08:41.171 --> 08:42.548
Just shut up!

08:42.672 --> 08:44.883
Why you going, Casey?
You know you're scared.

08:45.009 --> 08:46.468
He can't stay home. You know that.

08:46.593 --> 08:49.971
Too bad! Have to face
the big clowns all by yourself.

08:50.055 --> 08:53.433
- I'm not scared, so, shut up.
- You better sit next to Geoffrey.

08:53.517 --> 08:55.936
I don't want you peeing your pants on me.

09:12.826 --> 09:14.494
Trouble at that nuthouse.

09:15.079 --> 09:17.080
Where the crazy people live.

09:17.247 --> 09:18.999
What the hell's going on?

09:20.250 --> 09:22.503
Maybe they tried to break out.

09:24.421 --> 09:25.714
You know?

09:28.716 --> 09:30.718
Maybe to go to the circus.

09:40.894 --> 09:42.187
I'm crazy!

10:02.498 --> 10:04.709
<I>Showtime at 7:00 p.m.!

10:04.792 --> 10:07.377
<I>It'll be great fun for the whole family!

10:07.753 --> 10:10.756
<I>Lions, tigers, and bears. Oh, my!

10:12.716 --> 10:15.135
- The bearded lady was so fake.
- Right.

10:15.260 --> 10:18.013
- She was. You could tell.
- And you kissed her, I guess?

10:18.096 --> 10:22.100
<I>That's right, I'm talking to you!
Do you know who I am?

10:22.225 --> 10:25.854
<I>I'm Jolly Ollie.
The Jolly Brothers Circus clown.

10:26.187 --> 10:29.524
<I>And tonight, there's super
spectacular circus fun...

10:29.607 --> 10:31.859
<I>that I don't want you to miss.

10:31.943 --> 10:36.447
<I>Showtime at 7:00 p.m.
And it'll be great fun for the whole family.

10:36.822 --> 10:39.950
<I>Lions and tigers and bears. Oh, my!

10:44.330 --> 10:46.081
<I>Welcome to the big top!

11:03.972 --> 11:07.643
- Geoffrey, Casey.
- You think we like being with you either?

11:07.768 --> 11:09.895
What I think is you better watch your mouth.

11:09.979 --> 11:11.188
That.

11:11.730 --> 11:14.566
- That what?
- That's what I wanna do.

11:14.649 --> 11:16.568
- You know what that is?
- Fortunetelling?

11:16.651 --> 11:18.946
You're kidding me.
That's a bunch of bullshit.

11:19.028 --> 11:21.365
- It's phony, like everything here.
- It's his money.

11:21.489 --> 11:23.784
You want your fortune told? Give me $1.
I'll tell you.

11:23.866 --> 11:26.828
- You're ugly. You'll pee in your bed again.
- Randy, shut up!

11:27.495 --> 11:28.621
What?

11:29.205 --> 11:31.166
You forgetting something, Geoffrey?

11:31.791 --> 11:35.586
- Like who can bash your face?
- Come on, Geoff.

11:48.723 --> 11:51.184
- Go on, Case.
- There's no one in here.

11:52.852 --> 11:54.520
Casey, just go in.

12:00.234 --> 12:03.196
You're wasting your time.
They're probably on a coffee break.

12:03.321 --> 12:04.572
Yes.

12:18.585 --> 12:20.045
You wanted it.

12:23.506 --> 12:25.717
This is my little brother, Casey.

12:26.092 --> 12:28.094
He wants his fortune told.

12:44.901 --> 12:46.152
Come, Casey...

12:46.778 --> 12:48.071
your hand.

12:55.119 --> 12:56.454
Soft hand.

12:57.455 --> 13:01.543
It is good to be soft, but dangerous, too.

13:02.042 --> 13:03.752
You know what I say?

13:04.837 --> 13:06.380
Now, Casey.

13:07.297 --> 13:09.300
First, your line of wisdom.

13:10.050 --> 13:12.260
It is long and curving.

13:13.094 --> 13:14.597
That is very good.

13:15.513 --> 13:17.808
You have a great potential...

13:18.141 --> 13:20.726
to bring wisdom and happiness...

13:21.103 --> 13:24.105
to first yourself and then to others.

13:24.438 --> 13:28.150
And this, Casey, is your love line.

13:29.068 --> 13:30.903
- Still small.
- Like his pecker.

13:30.986 --> 13:32.488
But very deep.

13:32.613 --> 13:35.574
Now, most important...

13:35.949 --> 13:37.492
the life line.

13:38.119 --> 13:39.119
You see?

13:39.661 --> 13:41.663
It's starts here...

13:42.456 --> 13:45.292
and around it...

13:59.138 --> 14:00.598
Severed.

14:04.476 --> 14:05.686
You see?

14:05.811 --> 14:07.897
That's where your stitches were, wasn't it?

14:07.979 --> 14:10.524
- A scar?
- His right hand had stitches.

14:10.649 --> 14:14.277
- No, it was his left.
- lf it is a scar, there is no worry.

14:14.403 --> 14:19.199
- What if it isn't?
- Something very soon is cutting through...

14:19.782 --> 14:21.033
your lifeline.

14:21.159 --> 14:24.579
- That's a bunch of bullshit! Come on.
- Come on, Casey. Let's go.

14:25.830 --> 14:28.082
You must take great care.

14:28.166 --> 14:30.876
- Come on, let's go.
- Beware.

14:31.461 --> 14:35.548
In the darkest of dark,
though the flesh is young...

14:36.131 --> 14:38.050
and the hearts are strong...

14:38.508 --> 14:41.303
precious life cannot be long...

14:41.761 --> 14:45.724
when darkest death has left its mark.

14:46.850 --> 14:48.644
Go on! Get out of here!

14:50.812 --> 14:53.231
You know, lady, you got a real problem!

14:56.776 --> 14:58.861
What's the matter with you?

15:08.537 --> 15:10.873
- A-plus, Geoff!
- She wasn't supposed to say that.

15:10.998 --> 15:15.210
I told you it was bullshit.
Put your goddamn hand down.

15:15.377 --> 15:17.963
I wish Mom could see this.
You walked him right into it.

15:18.046 --> 15:20.047
She's not supposed to say that, all right?

15:20.131 --> 15:23.134
Every time, man.
Is he still your best brother, Case?

15:23.677 --> 15:26.971
Every time, man. I get blamed,
and you, little goody two-shoes...

15:27.054 --> 15:29.807
walks him in there,
and scares him more than a clown would.

15:29.890 --> 15:31.225
You don't give a shit about him.

15:31.351 --> 15:35.520
I'm tired of this baby crap!
I'm not your babysitter! You got that?

15:44.405 --> 15:47.115
All right, listen.
You're gonna sit in there...

15:47.740 --> 15:49.784
and you're gonna watch the show.

15:50.410 --> 15:52.412
And I'm gonna sit with Melissa.

15:53.288 --> 15:56.916
And I don't want to even know
I've got two little brothers.

15:59.460 --> 16:00.752
All right?

16:02.171 --> 16:04.047
All right, walk behind me.

16:51.300 --> 16:53.803
<I>The amazing Torchetto!

16:54.304 --> 16:56.431
<I>And now, in the center ring...

16:57.265 --> 16:59.767
<I>the wondrous, the incredible...

16:59.892 --> 17:02.311
<I>Gapino Brothers.

18:03.702 --> 18:05.412
<I>What the...

18:06.080 --> 18:07.748
<I>Wait just a minute.

18:07.873 --> 18:11.251
<I>Cheezo. Ladies and gentlemen,
Cheezo the Clown!

18:11.501 --> 18:15.963
<I>You want to do
what the amazing Gapino Brothers do?

18:20.593 --> 18:23.679
<I>You can't do it alone.
There's got to be more than one.

18:32.104 --> 18:34.190
<I>You've got to be kidding.

18:34.272 --> 18:37.150
<I>This is the rest of your trapeze act?

18:38.277 --> 18:40.112
<I>Bippo and Dippo?

18:42.405 --> 18:46.576
<I>All right, Cheezo, what are you waiting for?
Go on, get up there.

18:48.911 --> 18:50.872
<I>No, what?

18:53.249 --> 18:56.043
<I>Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls...

18:56.127 --> 18:58.379
<I>they want a volunteer.

18:58.462 --> 19:02.216
<I>They must be crazy. A volunteer?

19:11.266 --> 19:14.436
<I>Ladies and gentlemen,
apparently Cheezo the Clown...

19:14.560 --> 19:19.190
<I>has found some unlucky person
to be that fourth performer.

19:19.274 --> 19:22.401
<I>Is it a little boy? A little girl?

19:43.463 --> 19:44.756
No way.

19:52.888 --> 19:54.181
No!

20:13.991 --> 20:18.079
...over there, Randy.
What's he doing? Where's he going?

20:34.219 --> 20:35.971
It's just a man, Case.

20:36.930 --> 20:38.139
I know.

20:38.598 --> 20:41.434
- With paint on his face.
- Pretty funny?

20:42.727 --> 20:43.728
No.

20:47.857 --> 20:51.152
Know what I used to be afraid of?
I still, sort of, am.

20:51.569 --> 20:52.862
The Wolfman.

20:53.946 --> 20:55.448
I don't know why.

20:56.365 --> 20:57.783
I know he's fake...

20:58.701 --> 20:59.994
but still...

21:00.745 --> 21:03.122
That's what I don't like about clowns.

21:03.539 --> 21:06.375
Their faces are fake. Big happy eyes.

21:07.710 --> 21:10.378
Big painted smiles. It's not real.

21:13.881 --> 21:16.342
You never know what they really are.

21:21.347 --> 21:23.558
You're never gonna live this down,
you know.

21:23.682 --> 21:25.768
The whole damn town was watching.

21:27.770 --> 21:32.024
Anyone gives you any trouble,
you just come and get me, okay?

21:34.234 --> 21:35.611
Wanna go back in?

21:37.321 --> 21:38.656
Come on, then.

21:40.740 --> 21:43.410
We'll let Randy slobber over old Melissa...

21:43.869 --> 21:46.412
while you and me play some more games.

21:47.622 --> 21:49.707
Maybe we can win something for Mom.

21:49.832 --> 21:51.542
You're good at pitching baseballs, right?

21:51.668 --> 21:54.169
- A little.
- Well, sometimes...

22:06.307 --> 22:08.725
One more time. Here you go, kid, come on!

22:11.853 --> 22:14.064
Check this kid out. Seven in a row.

22:14.147 --> 22:17.066
Come on, one more time
and you win the grand prize.

22:17.858 --> 22:20.195
It's the wind-up, it's the pitch.

22:22.113 --> 22:23.656
Here you go.

22:24.532 --> 22:27.326
You deserve this. What's your secret, kid?

22:27.869 --> 22:29.619
Never think straight.

22:41.715 --> 22:44.425
Hi there, folks, what can I do for you?

22:45.509 --> 22:48.387
- Tell him what you want.
- I want a blue rabbit.

22:48.471 --> 22:51.223
That's a great animal.
Let me get that for you.

23:26.673 --> 23:28.008
Hey, Randy!

23:32.221 --> 23:34.806
Where have you guys been?
The show's been out 20 minutes.

23:34.890 --> 23:38.226
You'll never guess what Casey won.
Never in a million years.

23:39.478 --> 23:41.062
What the hell is that?

23:41.188 --> 23:42.939
What are you so hot about?

23:43.190 --> 23:45.108
- I want to get out of here.
- Where's Melissa?

23:45.191 --> 23:47.776
Shut up.
You got no right to say anything, bawl-baby.

23:47.860 --> 23:50.404
This goddamn town
thinks you're as chicken as they come.

23:50.530 --> 23:52.865
Mom and Dad find out,
they'll put you back in diapers.

23:52.991 --> 23:54.533
Shut up, Randy!

23:54.825 --> 23:56.743
Haven't you ever been scared before?

23:56.869 --> 23:59.413
Scared of how bad I'll bash you,
talk to me like that.

23:59.539 --> 24:02.792
- Do we still have to walk behind you?
- Just move your ass.

24:23.727 --> 24:26.731
Coco sounds like
she caught the old man cheating again.

24:27.272 --> 24:29.984
Little bastard could've broken my rib cage.

24:30.067 --> 24:33.028
Swell, you would've bled whiskey
all over the ring.

24:33.111 --> 24:36.740
- Yeah, gave him quite a scare.
- A little stage fright.

24:37.616 --> 24:40.701
Most kids are dying to get up there
with the rest of us.

24:43.455 --> 24:44.914
Now it's old Murray.

24:45.040 --> 24:48.001
<I>Tired of working for peanuts

24:48.084 --> 24:49.293
Yeah.

24:51.337 --> 24:53.839
What the hell is going on out there?

24:56.967 --> 24:58.385
What the hell?

25:21.783 --> 25:23.409
Kids, probably.

25:23.617 --> 25:26.412
Want to catch the clowns
with their pants down.

25:26.495 --> 25:30.082
And I will show them
something what they don't want to see.

25:30.333 --> 25:32.459
I'm sure you would, Charlie.

25:37.964 --> 25:41.759
- Get away from the tent, please!
- Show's over!

26:14.415 --> 26:15.583
Hello?

26:28.679 --> 26:29.804
Georgie?

26:47.697 --> 26:49.240
Oh, my God!

29:02.115 --> 29:03.575
What are you doing?

29:03.700 --> 29:06.870
I'm trying to figure out
if this is a whisker or a zit.

29:07.203 --> 29:10.415
You guys wanna show you
really got some hair? Casey?

29:12.542 --> 29:15.586
You wanna show you really got hair
where it counts?

29:15.670 --> 29:16.754
What?

29:17.380 --> 29:20.216
Since we're all feeling so brave tonight...

29:20.758 --> 29:22.802
and Mom won't be home till late...

29:24.428 --> 29:26.805
we could have some real scary fun.

29:29.683 --> 29:30.934
Remember?

29:32.352 --> 29:35.439
- Remember, Casey?
- Ghost stories.

29:36.314 --> 29:37.858
Yeah.

29:39.025 --> 29:40.401
You wanna?

29:40.944 --> 29:42.278
Wanna, Geoffrey?

29:46.366 --> 29:47.699
Midnight...

29:48.451 --> 29:50.411
or just thereabouts.

29:52.746 --> 29:53.998
Midnight...

29:55.040 --> 29:56.626
a time...

29:57.209 --> 30:01.004
for something awful, something evil...

30:02.338 --> 30:03.924
something real...

30:05.425 --> 30:06.551
or not.

30:08.845 --> 30:11.598
He was too scared to tell.

30:13.766 --> 30:17.895
It was that tingly feeling
on the back of his neck...

30:18.896 --> 30:20.731
that told him...

30:24.902 --> 30:26.069
they...

30:29.490 --> 30:30.991
were out there.

30:40.584 --> 30:42.251
What did they want?

30:43.586 --> 30:45.046
Why were they here?

30:45.838 --> 30:47.256
To scare him?

30:48.090 --> 30:50.259
To kill him?

30:51.886 --> 30:53.554
Alone and helpless.

30:54.430 --> 30:56.890
Sure, he had his ax...

30:58.017 --> 31:00.602
but what would that really bring him?

31:02.104 --> 31:04.814
Just more blood.

31:11.987 --> 31:13.990
He knew they would find him.

31:14.615 --> 31:17.409
All of them, their faces...

31:18.076 --> 31:20.329
<I>like painted nightmares.

31:21.038 --> 31:24.166
<I>Sure as anything real...

31:24.291 --> 31:26.626
<I>they would find him.

31:27.294 --> 31:31.256
<I>It was kind of like
they were already inside of him...

31:31.715 --> 31:35.051
<I>so they would always know...

31:35.469 --> 31:37.804
<I>where he was hiding.

31:38.638 --> 31:41.933
They're coming, Geoffrey.

31:43.518 --> 31:46.687
They're coming, Casey.

31:55.987 --> 32:00.284
- The clowns!
- The clowns are coming!

32:00.367 --> 32:02.619
They're coming to get you!

32:03.411 --> 32:06.622
They're gonna get us all!

32:06.790 --> 32:11.460
- On a stormy night.
- They're gonna get you, Casey, Randy!

32:24.055 --> 32:26.767
The clowns. They're coming!

32:28.560 --> 32:30.812
They're coming to get you, Randy!

33:04.303 --> 33:07.388
What's the matter, Case?
Think they're really coming to get us?

33:07.514 --> 33:11.601
I got that feeling, that tingly feeling
on the back of my neck.

33:12.101 --> 33:13.811
It's probably what's behind you.

33:13.978 --> 33:16.730
- Shut up!
- Made you look!

33:17.315 --> 33:20.193
- Mom said the kitchen's off-limits.
- So?

33:20.275 --> 33:23.111
You want to get our butts whipped
for a lousy bowl of popcorn?

33:23.237 --> 33:25.739
The only way we'll get our butts whipped...

33:38.167 --> 33:41.337
Remember last time?
The eggs in the microwave?

33:41.921 --> 33:43.673
Right. Whose fault was that?

34:12.574 --> 34:14.744
- You guys.
- I didn't hear her.

34:14.868 --> 34:16.120
Good. Then, you make it.

34:16.245 --> 34:19.415
No. You're the one who won't get in trouble.
She never yells at you.

34:19.540 --> 34:20.875
You guys?

34:32.052 --> 34:35.931
- Ghost story really worked on you, didn't it?
- Casey, what was it?

34:36.054 --> 34:39.266
Something real, or not, Case?

34:40.016 --> 34:42.186
Or are you too scared to tell?

34:49.525 --> 34:53.447
I say we make popcorn, and if we
catch hell for it, we all take the blame.

34:54.657 --> 34:56.741
Deal. Okay, Case?

34:57.826 --> 34:59.119
Clown-boy?

34:59.661 --> 35:00.870
Popcorn?

35:16.427 --> 35:19.971
<I>Don't be afraid of the dark, sweetheart

35:20.097 --> 35:24.017
<I>See, baby, lurking in the shadows of love

35:24.768 --> 35:26.770
<I>Oh, baby

35:26.853 --> 35:30.189
Oh, man! Casey! Geoffrey! Come here!

35:35.612 --> 35:36.988
You're kidding.

35:37.364 --> 35:39.490
- Maybe there's more.
- There's not.

35:39.573 --> 35:41.617
Who was the last one using the popcorn?

35:41.701 --> 35:44.995
- Who used the last of the popcorn?
- Mom said I could.

35:45.162 --> 35:48.123
- She just didn't get any more.
- That takes care of that.

35:48.207 --> 35:49.333
Like hell.

35:50.334 --> 35:53.212
- Petrie's is open.
- It's almost 11:00. We'll never make it.

35:53.336 --> 35:54.880
We would on old Jones Road.

35:55.005 --> 35:57.674
No one's walking old Jones Road
in the middle of the night.

35:57.758 --> 35:59.134
You are, Geoffrey.

35:59.634 --> 36:01.636
- You and Casey.
- No way.

36:03.013 --> 36:04.514
All right, Casey...

36:05.765 --> 36:07.016
then you go.

36:08.226 --> 36:10.269
- Forget it.
- He's kidding.

36:10.395 --> 36:11.521
You go.

36:13.606 --> 36:15.732
- Me?
- Yeah.

36:19.653 --> 36:23.865
Okay. You guys gonna stay here
and feel each other up while I'm gone?

36:23.990 --> 36:26.118
- No.
- Are you scared to go alone?

36:26.243 --> 36:27.870
- No.
- Says you.

36:28.369 --> 36:30.788
Says you. You're full of shit, Geoffrey.

36:31.205 --> 36:35.334
<I>You've been watching too many Creature
Features. They're starting to rot your brain.

36:35.418 --> 36:37.086
Maybe we should all go.

36:37.378 --> 36:41.716
Yeah, then we can all be murdered
by the big, bad bogeyman clowns out there.

36:41.799 --> 36:43.592
Don't say that, Randy.

36:43.842 --> 36:45.093
You coming?

36:52.350 --> 36:54.978
- I'm going with Randy.
- What? Why?

36:55.104 --> 36:58.398
- Let's all go.
- Geoffrey's afraid to go, Case.

37:00.608 --> 37:03.194
- Come on, we're going.
- We'll be right back.

37:04.320 --> 37:06.072
Why are you going with him, Case?

37:09.950 --> 37:11.411
We'll be right back.

38:03.835 --> 38:07.547
<I>So don't be afraid of the dark

38:08.256 --> 38:09.715
<I>sweetheart

38:10.508 --> 38:11.967
<I>Oh, baby

38:24.604 --> 38:26.189
- Don't!
- I'll race you!

38:26.315 --> 38:29.692
We got to make it to Petrie's
in seven minutes, buddy. Let's go.

38:29.817 --> 38:32.487
The dark's scary if you run through it.

38:32.653 --> 38:35.657
Will you grow up, Casey?
What's out there that's gonna grab us?

38:35.781 --> 38:39.034
Just 'cause it's dark doesn't mean
there's something awful out there.

38:39.160 --> 38:43.372
- It means you can't tell if there is.
- That's baby thinking, Casey. Grow up.

38:43.956 --> 38:47.292
- Okay? Let's go. Come on!
- Randy, don't make me run, please?

38:48.753 --> 38:52.297
I'll buy you a bag of jellybeans
if you beat me there, all right?

38:52.756 --> 38:53.757
No!

38:58.344 --> 38:59.763
I'm not running!

39:00.304 --> 39:02.015
Randy! Wait!

39:06.644 --> 39:07.812
Listen!

39:28.623 --> 39:30.625
There's someone behind me!

39:33.169 --> 39:35.212
Randy, you ran all the way?

39:39.050 --> 39:40.426
Randy, help!

39:42.761 --> 39:44.263
I'm gonna kill him.

39:49.018 --> 39:52.395
Get off me, you little shit.
What the hell's the matter with you?

39:52.479 --> 39:55.398
- There's somebody behind me, chasing me.
- My ass.

39:55.774 --> 39:57.400
Shut up, there was.

39:57.484 --> 40:00.194
You came barreling
in here like a freight train.

40:02.238 --> 40:03.823
Look at this mess.

40:07.785 --> 40:10.079
I'm gonna kill you, you little turd.

40:10.454 --> 40:12.248
I'll take care of this, Jasper.

40:12.372 --> 40:15.876
- You go and pull those crates...
- Hear me? I'm gonna tear you to pieces.

40:15.959 --> 40:17.586
...first thing in the morning.

40:18.128 --> 40:20.172
I'll be heading on home, then, Ellie.

40:20.297 --> 40:24.175
- Fine and dandy. You go on, then.
- Good night, boys.

40:24.926 --> 40:27.762
Casey, old man. Slow down, you hear?

40:35.812 --> 40:37.563
Let's get you cleaned up.

40:57.540 --> 40:59.250
Who the hell is in there?

41:06.882 --> 41:08.301
Is someone in here?

42:00.975 --> 42:02.519
Who the hell is that?

43:54.332 --> 43:57.752
<I>KOBA News, every hour on the hour.
More on the grisly murder...

43:57.835 --> 44:01.297
<I>and apparent breakout only hours ago
at the Poho County State Hospital...

44:01.423 --> 44:03.132
<I>where three mental patients escaped...

44:03.257 --> 44:06.761
<I>after what authorities there said
was a denial of their circus privileges.

44:06.844 --> 44:09.472
<I>The Jolly Brothers Circus
at Hanksville tonight...

44:09.555 --> 44:12.098
<I>was attended
by a majority of the institution's inmates.

44:12.182 --> 44:14.601
<I>Police began
an intense three-county search...

45:12.739 --> 45:15.409
<I>Casey's walkin', walkin' scared

45:15.534 --> 45:18.370
<I>'Tween his legs, he's got no hair

45:18.495 --> 45:19.704
<I>'Fraid of clowns

45:19.829 --> 45:21.372
Wait up, Randy, I mean it.

45:21.498 --> 45:23.625
<I>He'll pee the bed, so better beware

45:24.084 --> 45:25.293
Please!

45:26.210 --> 45:27.420
<I>One, two

45:27.545 --> 45:29.964
- Randy, wait up!
- Hurry up, soldier.

45:30.089 --> 45:32.716
You're an embarrassment
to this platoon, mister.

45:32.800 --> 45:35.719
- You're not funny, Randy!
- Do you understand me?

45:36.053 --> 45:38.013
I mean it, Randy. You're not...

45:42.726 --> 45:44.395
You're not funny, Randy.

45:45.145 --> 45:48.606
I know you're hiding.
You'll jump out and try and scare me.

45:48.732 --> 45:50.984
It's not gonna work, so forget it.

46:54.419 --> 46:55.878
They're here, Randy!

46:57.630 --> 47:01.592
What the hell are you talking about?
What are you talking about? Who?

47:04.637 --> 47:07.473
The clowns, Randy. They're here.

47:10.850 --> 47:13.896
Casey, you are
the weirdest brother I've ever had.

47:14.145 --> 47:16.940
Let's go home, Randy.
Hold my hand, please?

47:18.442 --> 47:19.901
Randy, please?

47:38.794 --> 47:40.838
Don't ever leave me again, Randy.

47:40.962 --> 47:43.507
- Please? Ever.
- Just keep walking.

47:43.882 --> 47:47.051
- Promise?
- Walk, Casey. I'm not leaving anyone.

47:59.564 --> 48:00.731
Funny.

48:02.191 --> 48:05.695
Real funny. Little jerk-off Geoffrey
put the dummy back up again.

48:05.819 --> 48:08.155
- That's so scary.
- Randy.

48:08.238 --> 48:10.491
What do you think
of your best brother now?

48:10.574 --> 48:12.784
Randy, Geoffrey wouldn't do that.

48:13.285 --> 48:14.703
He wouldn't?

48:17.747 --> 48:19.833
Those are Geoffrey's clothes.

48:20.625 --> 48:25.088
Randy, if Geoffrey wanted to scare us,
he'd use some of our clothes, wouldn't he?

48:25.505 --> 48:28.215
What are you trying to tell me?
You think this is Geoffrey?

48:28.299 --> 48:30.217
You think he's dead, Case?

48:30.593 --> 48:33.595
You think the clowns took him up
and hung him in the yard?

48:33.721 --> 48:37.016
Yeah. That's what happened.
I'll bet that's what happened.

48:37.099 --> 48:40.352
And this is gonna be
Geoffrey's cold, dead body...

48:40.852 --> 48:42.437
waiting to grab me...

48:43.271 --> 48:44.939
from beyond the...

48:47.067 --> 48:50.320
Son of a bitch! What the hell
do you think you're doing, asshole?

48:50.445 --> 48:52.780
You were scared, Randy.

48:52.906 --> 48:55.491
- Yeah?
- Yeah. How does it feel?

48:55.825 --> 48:59.454
You're sick, you little shit.
I ought to fucking kill you.

48:59.578 --> 49:03.416
I just wanted you to get a little scared.
You know, like Casey.

49:04.333 --> 49:07.711
You want any of this,
you're gonna have to kill me for it.

49:14.301 --> 49:16.302
I didn't mean to scare you, Case.

49:17.137 --> 49:18.639
He was crying, almost.

49:18.763 --> 49:21.641
He's probably going upstairs
to change his underwear.

49:21.766 --> 49:23.601
Maybe you shouldn't have done it.

49:23.684 --> 49:25.478
He deserves a lot worse than that.

49:25.603 --> 49:28.105
Maybe stuff like that just makes him meaner.

49:28.231 --> 49:30.524
I didn't know you could get any meaner.

49:30.649 --> 49:32.443
They really are out tonight.

49:32.985 --> 49:34.862
- Who are?
- The clowns.

49:39.950 --> 49:41.410
They are?

49:42.202 --> 49:43.245
Yeah.

49:46.581 --> 49:48.416
Come on. Let's get inside.

50:48.890 --> 50:50.558
Would you shut up, please?

51:02.737 --> 51:03.821
Make me.

51:08.658 --> 51:10.077
Jesus, Randy!

51:20.836 --> 51:21.880
Shit!

51:22.505 --> 51:25.508
- The tape's ruined.
- That's really too bad.

51:25.633 --> 51:27.051
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

51:28.594 --> 51:30.304
What did you do, Randy?

51:31.264 --> 51:32.974
Let me tell you something.

51:33.307 --> 51:34.850
When I get you...

51:34.975 --> 51:37.686
it's gonna be good, real good.

51:39.438 --> 51:40.564
Go check the fuse box.

51:40.689 --> 51:42.274
- You go check it.
- Why me?

51:42.398 --> 51:46.445
'Cause Daddy only showed his favorite little
boy how to change the goddamn things.

51:47.362 --> 51:49.197
What's the matter, Geoffrey?

51:49.780 --> 51:52.325
A little afraid of a big dark house?

51:57.538 --> 51:58.831
What was that?

52:04.295 --> 52:05.629
Downstairs.

52:06.463 --> 52:07.464
Nothing.

52:07.798 --> 52:09.716
No. That was the front door.

52:10.467 --> 52:11.759
How do you know?

52:12.052 --> 52:14.513
I've heard Dad sneak in a million times.

52:18.224 --> 52:20.393
It's got to be Dad.

52:21.644 --> 52:25.189
- We should just go look.
- All right, go. You're the oldest.

52:25.314 --> 52:27.900
So, Casey's the youngest,
does that mean he should go?

52:27.984 --> 52:29.193
No way.

52:29.360 --> 52:31.112
You a little scared, big brother?

52:37.117 --> 52:39.536
- We should call the police.
- Yeah, it's 911.

52:39.661 --> 52:40.996
- The phone's down the hall.
- Go.

52:41.121 --> 52:44.916
Fuck you! I'm an asshole until there's
something to do that scares you. You go!

52:51.173 --> 52:54.592
I'll go, but you've got to say
I'm braver than you.

52:55.635 --> 52:58.304
Say it! Say "Geoffrey's braver than Randy."

53:02.516 --> 53:05.936
- How'd you like me to call an ambulance...
- You're scared and you know it.

53:06.019 --> 53:08.730
You made Case feel like shit tonight
'cause he was scared.

53:08.855 --> 53:11.649
You took him to a freaky fortune lady
who scared the shit...

53:11.775 --> 53:13.026
Come on, guys, stop it!

53:13.152 --> 53:16.279
- You're a chicken-shit little wimp.
- I know you are, but what am I?

53:16.363 --> 53:17.906
You're a little dick.

53:18.031 --> 53:20.784
Come on, call the police.
Call Officer Friendly.

53:20.867 --> 53:24.203
It's probably nothing, not a goddamn thing.
A fuse goes out...

53:24.328 --> 53:27.832
all of a sudden you guys are freaking out.
You're freaking me out.

53:29.375 --> 53:30.334
No.

53:32.295 --> 53:33.838
Call Officer Friendly.

53:34.588 --> 53:37.967
What will you tell him?
The lights went out, I heard a noise?

53:38.049 --> 53:40.635
What are we to do?
Everyone's chicken to go to the attic.

53:40.719 --> 53:42.679
Stay here, piss in your pants all night.

53:42.763 --> 53:45.515
I say we draw straws
and see who fixes the fuse.

53:47.642 --> 53:48.643
Case?

53:51.729 --> 53:54.899
- Casey can't go up there alone.
- No. We're all men, we all draw.

53:55.024 --> 53:57.527
We all take the same chance. You got that?

54:30.933 --> 54:34.269
All right. The shortest one fixes the fuse.

54:35.103 --> 54:37.147
No feeling around. Just take one.

54:42.569 --> 54:44.237
All right. Let's see them.

54:48.283 --> 54:50.702
Looks like you're elected, Geoff, old bro.

54:50.785 --> 54:53.246
I think you might be my best brother, too.

54:55.581 --> 54:57.875
You got the shortest straw,
Randy, you cheater!

54:57.958 --> 55:01.754
You taught me everything I know!
Is the shortest straw gonna go fix the fuse...

55:01.837 --> 55:04.715
or are we gonna stand around
in the dark all night?

55:05.173 --> 55:06.216
You see me going?

55:06.342 --> 55:09.719
No. Being a little wet in the Jockeys
slow you down a little?

55:10.595 --> 55:12.138
You got amnesia, little buddy?

55:12.263 --> 55:15.726
You better shut your goddamn mouth
or I'm gonna bash you to shit.

55:19.061 --> 55:21.981
You're gonna be sorry this night
ever happened, little buddy!

55:22.106 --> 55:23.649
I promise you that.

55:32.991 --> 55:35.119
- Think you can go to bed?
- No way!

55:35.661 --> 55:37.328
What are you looking for?

55:39.497 --> 55:41.916
Come on, then. Let's go read some comics.

55:42.000 --> 55:44.293
- Not scary ones.
- Right.

55:45.462 --> 55:48.131
Just trying to get me
under Casey's Revenge?

57:26.223 --> 57:27.683
"Get back, both of you!

57:27.766 --> 57:31.394
"But they could not hear.
They could only stare, akimbo and agog.

57:31.729 --> 57:35.857
"Wait! Come back!
Don't go out there! Don't you see?

57:36.274 --> 57:38.610
"Don't you see how awful that thing is?

57:39.068 --> 57:40.987
"Before anyone could suggest help...

57:43.865 --> 57:46.159
<I>"'How could he not see it? '
the others thought.

57:46.284 --> 57:49.412
<I>"'How could something so evil
and so awful be so near...

57:58.129 --> 57:59.797
<I>"'and not draw attention? '

58:02.216 --> 58:04.926
"The green gob
of monstrous mucous moved.

58:08.846 --> 58:11.265
"Guns blazed, but it did not stop.

58:11.474 --> 58:14.352
"The boys thought for sure all was lost.

58:15.853 --> 58:17.855
"No, no, not now!"

58:34.120 --> 58:36.539
We're coming to get you!

58:43.338 --> 58:45.923
- Randy.
- Why don't you come down and see me?

58:47.925 --> 58:51.012
That is, if you're not too scared!

58:52.012 --> 58:54.349
We're coming, Geoffrey!

58:56.517 --> 58:58.769
We're all coming!

59:01.313 --> 59:03.773
We're all coming in, boys!

59:04.066 --> 59:05.609
Can you hear us?

59:12.616 --> 59:15.076
Just forget him, Case, he can't get in.

01:00:11.087 --> 01:00:13.757
Randy, what the hell
are you doing down there?

01:00:30.188 --> 01:00:33.317
You stay here
and don't unlock the door for anyone...

01:00:33.441 --> 01:00:35.152
unless you're sure it's me.

01:00:35.235 --> 01:00:36.403
No way.

01:00:37.904 --> 01:00:39.406
I'm going with you.

01:00:40.656 --> 01:00:44.077
- You know he's just gonna try to scare us.
- I'm going with you!

01:00:46.246 --> 01:00:48.414
All right. But you stay close.

01:00:56.630 --> 01:00:58.924
Randy, goddamn it, answer!

01:01:01.551 --> 01:01:03.553
Randy, you're being a jerk!

01:01:06.473 --> 01:01:09.101
Randy, you jump out at us,
you're an asshole!

01:01:11.602 --> 01:01:13.312
You are such a dick!

01:01:28.494 --> 01:01:30.412
Randy, you hear me?

01:01:48.638 --> 01:01:49.806
Go away.

01:01:50.431 --> 01:01:51.474
What?

01:03:56.050 --> 01:03:57.509
Jesus, Casey.

01:04:02.389 --> 01:04:04.975
Geoffrey, what are we gonna do?

01:04:06.226 --> 01:04:07.727
Who the hell are they?

01:04:08.144 --> 01:04:09.604
My nightmare.

01:04:24.785 --> 01:04:26.745
They did something to the doors.

01:04:29.623 --> 01:04:31.708
- What about Randy?
- Shut up, Casey.

01:04:31.834 --> 01:04:35.087
- He's still in here, someplace.
- We've to get out of here and get help!

01:04:35.170 --> 01:04:37.589
Geoffrey! What if he's dead?

01:04:43.970 --> 01:04:45.972
Casey! Get the hell out of here!

01:04:52.603 --> 01:04:53.979
- No way!
- The den window!

01:04:54.104 --> 01:04:56.231
- Too dark.
- I want you to go to Mrs. Appleby's...

01:04:56.315 --> 01:04:57.357
tell her to call the cops.

01:04:57.483 --> 01:04:59.943
- What if she's dead?
- Go to the James' and tell them!

01:05:00.026 --> 01:05:01.111
The James' are on vacation.

01:05:01.235 --> 01:05:03.989
Then go to the nearest other people
and get help.

01:05:20.045 --> 01:05:21.547
Never think straight!

01:05:30.055 --> 01:05:32.181
That was Mom's favorite lamp, Casey.

01:06:11.177 --> 01:06:14.138
They really do know
where I'm hiding, Geoffrey?

01:06:15.097 --> 01:06:16.640
I don't know, Case.

01:06:17.141 --> 01:06:19.685
We got to get out of here.
We got to get help.

01:06:21.228 --> 01:06:22.687
There's three.

01:06:23.146 --> 01:06:25.107
There's one more, Geoffrey.

01:06:29.235 --> 01:06:31.155
Case, the den window.

01:06:32.739 --> 01:06:33.949
Come on!

01:06:38.786 --> 01:06:40.497
Geoffrey, it's open.

01:06:44.708 --> 01:06:46.710
He wants us to go out there.

01:06:47.211 --> 01:06:49.296
Cheezo, he wants us to go outside.

01:06:49.922 --> 01:06:52.758
- It's a trap.
- It's our only chance to get out.

01:06:52.883 --> 01:06:56.011
We got to run for it, you got it?
We got to run our ass off.

01:06:56.136 --> 01:06:57.221
Wait.

01:07:08.982 --> 01:07:11.109
- What?
- The dummy.

01:07:13.235 --> 01:07:14.403
It's Randy.

01:07:17.322 --> 01:07:20.785
- It can't be, it's got clown stuff on.
- It's him, I know it.

01:07:20.909 --> 01:07:23.287
Wait, Casey. No.

01:07:24.413 --> 01:07:28.125
Casey, I want you to run.
Right now. Run to Mrs. Appleby's.

01:07:29.292 --> 01:07:31.837
Do you hear me? Casey, I want you to run.

01:07:32.546 --> 01:07:34.589
Right now. Tell her to call the police.

01:07:34.715 --> 01:07:36.299
Stay there. Casey!

01:07:45.849 --> 01:07:49.436
What the hell's the matter with you?
Are you crazy?

01:07:49.811 --> 01:07:51.897
You can't go back into that house.

01:07:51.980 --> 01:07:53.982
We're going to get help. Okay?

01:07:55.067 --> 01:07:56.734
You listening to me?

01:07:58.320 --> 01:07:59.738
All right. Come on.

01:08:01.281 --> 01:08:02.407
No!

01:08:02.490 --> 01:08:05.952
Mrs. Appleby! Mr. James!
Please! Come help! Quick!

01:08:16.420 --> 01:08:18.005
Where is he, Geoffrey?

01:08:19.506 --> 01:08:20.841
Where's Randy?

01:08:21.675 --> 01:08:23.093
I don't know.

01:09:09.845 --> 01:09:11.638
I think he's dead, Geoffrey.

01:09:12.432 --> 01:09:14.683
For Christ's sake,
now will you go get help?

01:09:14.767 --> 01:09:16.643
We got to get him out of here.

01:09:17.560 --> 01:09:19.313
We'll put him back in the closet.

01:09:19.395 --> 01:09:21.481
They already know he's in there.

01:09:22.149 --> 01:09:24.443
- We got to get help!
- Put him in the den.

01:09:25.234 --> 01:09:28.363
- Goddamn it, Casey!
- Got to put him where he'll be safe.

01:09:41.250 --> 01:09:44.962
- Casey, I need your help.
- I think that was a police car.

01:09:45.796 --> 01:09:47.048
Hurry up.

01:09:49.633 --> 01:09:50.968
Come on, Case.

01:10:01.811 --> 01:10:03.354
I think he's alive.

01:10:05.439 --> 01:10:06.816
Come on, Casey.

01:10:07.608 --> 01:10:11.029
I need your help.
It's darker than dark in here.

01:11:09.083 --> 01:11:12.503
<I>If you'd like to make a call,
please hang up and try again.

01:11:12.837 --> 01:11:16.173
<I>If you need help,
hang up and then dial your operator.

01:11:45.617 --> 01:11:48.371
<I>-Police, emergency.
- Officer Friendly?

01:11:48.662 --> 01:11:51.874
<I>-I'm sorry. Who did you want?
- Officer Friendly. Please hurry.

01:11:51.999 --> 01:11:55.961
<I>-Roger, it's some kid.
-This is Lt. Corman, can I help you?

01:11:56.252 --> 01:11:59.339
<I>- Is this Officer Friendly?
-That's right. Who's this?

01:11:59.547 --> 01:12:03.593
This is Casey Collins.
I live at 12 Oak, Oak Tree Circle.

01:12:04.928 --> 01:12:07.137
<I>Hello, Casey.
What seems to be the trouble?

01:12:07.221 --> 01:12:09.306
The clowns are trying to get me.

01:12:09.891 --> 01:12:11.601
<I>Clowns, did you say?

01:12:12.727 --> 01:12:14.061
Hurry, please.

01:12:14.144 --> 01:12:17.189
<I>What do you mean "clowns," Casey?
You mean circus clowns?

01:12:18.315 --> 01:12:21.276
<I>Casey, do you have any idea
what time it is right now?

01:12:21.401 --> 01:12:23.486
<I>- 3:00.
That's right, Casey.

01:12:23.570 --> 01:12:26.698
<I>You know, this is the police.
Do you think maybe...

01:12:26.823 --> 01:12:31.244
<I>you might just have woken up,
you know, like maybe it's just a nightmare?

01:12:32.662 --> 01:12:35.289
<I>Where are your parents, Casey?
Can you tell me that?

01:12:35.706 --> 01:12:38.877
My mom's at my Aunt Mia's,
and my dad's in Cleveland.

01:12:39.293 --> 01:12:43.172
<I>Casey, I'd like you to hang up this phone
right now, and your nightmare's gone.

01:12:43.256 --> 01:12:46.300
<I>Go ahead. Try it.
If that doesn't work...

01:17:01.500 --> 01:17:03.334
Nightmare's over, Case.
