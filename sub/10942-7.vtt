00:01.835 --> 00:03.769
Announcer:
The time for Amy Fleming and Caleb Odell...

00:03.838 --> 00:04.938
8.2 seconds!

00:05.840 --> 00:07.040
I don't need a horse healer

00:07.107 --> 00:08.274
trying to teach me how to ride.

00:08.342 --> 00:09.475
She's trying to help.

00:09.543 --> 00:11.543
But Amy and me
is not gonna happen.

00:11.610 --> 00:14.146
Amy: Isn't that Lightning Dex?
Lisa's horse?

00:14.214 --> 00:15.447
Yeah, it was.

00:15.514 --> 00:17.515
I just bought us
a winning ticket.

00:17.583 --> 00:20.352
Announcer: Here comes Lightning
Dexter making a move on the outside.

00:20.419 --> 00:21.619
Ty:
Probably tendonitis.

00:21.687 --> 00:22.754
Ah, that's great.

00:22.822 --> 00:24.289
Dad, it's not a career ender.

00:24.357 --> 00:26.858
Oh, I think Roy Rogers
found himself a sidekick.

00:26.925 --> 00:28.726
Jamie:
Hey, Mallory.

00:28.793 --> 00:29.961
Jamie?!

00:30.963 --> 00:32.628
It must've cost a fortune.
How did...

00:32.697 --> 00:34.431
You let me worry about it.

00:36.235 --> 00:37.468
(Horse grunts)

00:42.540 --> 00:43.773
(Hooves thud)

00:51.548 --> 00:52.949

Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:03.760 --> 01:05.227
See what I'm saying?

01:05.295 --> 01:07.562
Yeah. Yeah,
his stride's definitely off.

01:07.630 --> 01:10.065
Yeah, and it's screwing up
my timing.

01:10.133 --> 01:11.200
The jackpot's this weekend,

01:11.268 --> 01:13.535
so I gotta be roping good
by then.

01:13.603 --> 01:15.270
It could be your saddle.

01:15.337 --> 01:16.637
(Sighs) I...

01:16.705 --> 01:18.839
I just can't afford a big
major expense right now.

01:18.908 --> 01:19.974
No, you don't necessarily
have to...

01:20.042 --> 01:21.409
Kit:
Yeah.

01:21.476 --> 01:22.911
Save your money, Caleb.

01:22.978 --> 01:25.579
Get one of those gel pads
for under your saddle.

01:25.647 --> 01:28.116
Unless you've got some
magic potion?

01:28.183 --> 01:30.518
No. Saddle pad's pretty much
what I was thinking.

01:32.653 --> 01:34.454
All right, well,
looks like problem solved.

01:34.522 --> 01:35.522
I gotta run.

01:35.589 --> 01:36.924
I got lots of stuff
to do today.

01:36.991 --> 01:37.925
See you, guys.

01:37.992 --> 01:39.626
Thank you.

01:44.332 --> 01:45.632
(Half laughs)

01:45.699 --> 01:48.067
Are you two girls ever gonna
get over yourselves?

01:48.135 --> 01:50.669
Don't count on it happening
anytime soon.

01:50.737 --> 01:51.770
Hm.

01:53.040 --> 01:54.407
Dan:
Hey, Tim.

01:54.474 --> 01:55.607
Tim:
Hey.

01:55.675 --> 01:56.875
Dan:
I hear you're head honcho

01:56.944 --> 01:58.644
at the team roping jackpot
this year.

01:58.711 --> 01:59.912
Yeah.

01:59.980 --> 02:01.847
Yeah, Jack and I got talked
into it again.

02:01.915 --> 02:04.215
Hope you're planning on
kicking in a few bucks.

02:04.283 --> 02:06.284
Dan: (With a laugh) A few bucks?

02:06.352 --> 02:09.753
I'm practically sponsoring
the whole damn thing.

02:09.822 --> 02:11.789
I don't even like roping.

02:11.857 --> 02:13.591
You still hanging on
to this horse?

02:14.493 --> 02:16.428
You haven't canned him yet?

02:16.495 --> 02:18.863
Dexter?
The comeback kid?

02:18.931 --> 02:20.931
I heard he blew a tendon.

02:20.999 --> 02:22.333
Ho-ho!

02:22.400 --> 02:23.934
Ah, he's ready to race.

02:24.002 --> 02:25.735
Yeah, right.

02:25.803 --> 02:27.804
I guess I dodged a bullet
when Lisa sold him to you

02:27.872 --> 02:29.406
instead of me.

02:29.474 --> 02:31.908
I mean, God,
vet bills, therapy...

02:31.977 --> 02:33.810
That must be costing you
a bundle.

02:33.878 --> 02:35.644
Ah, it comes with
the territory, huh.

02:35.712 --> 02:37.347
The territory?
Yeah.

02:37.414 --> 02:39.849
What do you got, three horses?

02:39.916 --> 02:42.818
I tell you what,
compared to my outfit,

02:42.886 --> 02:45.288
that's small potatoes.

02:46.556 --> 02:49.058
Ashley: So, I hear you're
a real escape artist.

02:49.126 --> 02:50.460
(Sighs)
What're you talking about?

02:50.527 --> 02:52.361
I just got off the phone
with Caleb.

02:52.428 --> 02:54.296
He said you totally
ditched him.

02:54.364 --> 02:55.630
Come on.
I had things to do.

02:55.698 --> 02:58.200
You always do
whenever Kit shows up.

02:58.267 --> 03:00.768
Yeah, well,
she's not my favourite person.

03:00.836 --> 03:02.437
Well, personally speaking,

03:02.505 --> 03:03.805
I'm glad she's friends
with Caleb.

03:03.873 --> 03:05.840
I mean, she could talk
to him about rodeo

03:05.908 --> 03:07.574
'til he's blue in the face

03:07.642 --> 03:09.776
and I don't even have
to pretend like I care.

03:09.844 --> 03:12.380
It's the secret
to a successful marriage.

03:12.447 --> 03:14.315
That and big jewels.

03:15.283 --> 03:16.317
The problem is,

03:16.385 --> 03:18.386
ever since he bought me
this rock,

03:18.453 --> 03:20.388
my tips have gone way down.

03:20.455 --> 03:21.889
Why? People figure
you don't need the money?

03:21.956 --> 03:23.323
Which is so not true.

03:23.391 --> 03:26.292
I mean, we need it now
more than ever.

03:26.360 --> 03:28.161
(Cash register dings)

03:32.500 --> 03:33.766
Okay, buddy.

03:33.834 --> 03:36.602
So, two grams of bute,
morning and night?

03:36.670 --> 03:38.604
Yeah. And keep on
with the ice.

03:38.672 --> 03:40.639
And what about the ultrasound?

03:40.706 --> 03:42.341
Scott says nothing showed up.

03:42.409 --> 03:43.675
Nothing on the x-rays
either.

03:43.743 --> 03:45.377
Great, clean bill of health.

03:45.445 --> 03:46.512
Not exactly.

03:46.579 --> 03:48.080
He wants to schedule an MRI,

03:48.148 --> 03:50.082
see if there's anything
going on in the hoof.

03:50.150 --> 03:52.651
What is that gonna set me back?

03:52.718 --> 03:53.785
Well, it's not cheap.

03:53.853 --> 03:55.020
But it's the only way to see

03:55.087 --> 03:56.921
if there's any soft tissue
damage.

03:56.988 --> 03:58.556
Okay, well...

03:58.623 --> 04:02.626
Nothing but the best
for my equine friend.

04:05.264 --> 04:06.297
(Truck rumbles)

04:14.638 --> 04:16.373
Maybe we should just
forget about the mail;

04:16.440 --> 04:18.175
it'll probably just be bills.

04:18.242 --> 04:19.209
Ash...

04:19.277 --> 04:20.209
Maybe we could just ignore it

04:20.278 --> 04:21.278
and it'll just go away.

04:21.345 --> 04:22.446
Ashley!

04:28.818 --> 04:30.886
Ashley:
Oh my God!

Tim:
I don't know, Amy.

05:21.801 --> 05:24.237
Do you think he looks
depressed?

05:24.304 --> 05:25.671
(Laughs) No.

05:26.607 --> 05:27.940
But you do, dad.

05:28.008 --> 05:30.909
Oh, come on, honey,
I should be.

05:30.977 --> 05:32.677
I mean, I've got a horse
that loves to run,

05:32.745 --> 05:35.113
now all he wants to do
around in his stall,

05:35.181 --> 05:38.283
eat hay and take leisurely
strolls around the track.

05:38.351 --> 05:39.817
That sounds like heaven
for a horse.

05:39.885 --> 05:42.287
Yeah, well it's not for me.

05:42.355 --> 05:45.990
My former money maker's
turned into a money pit,

05:46.058 --> 05:47.924
and my jockey is up in Edmonton

05:47.992 --> 05:49.960
riding a horse
that can actually run.

05:50.028 --> 05:52.429
Dad, you can see that
he's getting better, right?

05:52.497 --> 05:53.797
These things take time.

05:53.865 --> 05:55.332
Yeah, except time is money,

05:55.400 --> 05:58.335
and I'm running out of both.

05:58.403 --> 05:59.436
You know, the first person

05:59.504 --> 06:01.238
that makes me
a real serious offer

06:01.306 --> 06:03.106
can have this damn horse.

06:03.174 --> 06:04.240
(Hooves thud)

06:11.382 --> 06:12.315
Jake:
Can you practice today?

06:12.383 --> 06:13.949
Jamie:
Absolutely!

06:15.085 --> 06:16.319
Oh, hey, Mallory.

06:16.387 --> 06:17.720
Hi, guys.

06:17.788 --> 06:19.688
I just filled out
my entry form.

06:19.755 --> 06:20.989
Youth division.

06:21.057 --> 06:23.458
The jackpot.
Who're you roping with?

06:23.526 --> 06:26.895
Hello? (Half laughs)
Who do you think?

06:26.962 --> 06:30.332
Well, I gotta go post these up
with Badger, so...

06:30.400 --> 06:31.333
You and Badger?

06:31.401 --> 06:32.867
Really?

06:32.935 --> 06:36.837
Is he, like, officially
your boyfriend now?

06:36.905 --> 06:38.439
Sort of...

06:38.507 --> 06:40.140
Kind of...

06:40.209 --> 06:41.609
Yes. Definitely.

06:43.745 --> 06:45.813
I've gotta go.

06:52.052 --> 06:53.253
Excuse me.

06:53.321 --> 06:54.987
What is this?

06:56.090 --> 06:58.124
Why didn't you tell me?

06:58.192 --> 06:59.492
Let me see it.
Mom!

06:59.560 --> 07:02.795
You know it's bad luck
to take it off.

07:02.863 --> 07:04.764
I'll have to remember that
if I ever get married again!

07:04.832 --> 07:06.833
Ashley and Val:
(Half laugh)

07:06.900 --> 07:09.968
Oh, honey, that is really nice.

07:10.870 --> 07:13.372
I'm trying not to get
too attached it.

07:13.440 --> 07:14.607
I might have to sell it.

07:15.742 --> 07:17.643
And the beemer too.

07:17.711 --> 07:20.078
Can't afford trailer park
lifestyle any longer?

07:20.146 --> 07:21.680
Well, our landlord
subdivided the ranch

07:21.748 --> 07:23.781
and put the lots up for sale.

07:23.849 --> 07:26.851
Mmm.
How much is he asking?

07:26.918 --> 07:28.753
Our lot is two and a half
acres,

07:28.820 --> 07:32.523
so the down payment shouldn't be
totally outrageous.

07:32.591 --> 07:34.158
If you sell everything you own?

07:34.226 --> 07:35.593
Yeah. I guess.

07:36.528 --> 07:38.062
Well...

07:38.130 --> 07:39.296
I know you're not
telling me this

07:39.364 --> 07:41.831
because you want my help.

07:41.899 --> 07:43.300
Tried that once before,
didn't we?

07:43.368 --> 07:44.434
But that husband of yours...

07:44.502 --> 07:46.236
He has to do things
his own way, mom.

07:46.304 --> 07:48.104
Mm-hmm.

07:48.172 --> 07:50.940
Which is why I wanted
to talk to you.

07:51.008 --> 07:52.075
Alone.

07:55.945 --> 07:57.012
(Whack)

08:00.850 --> 08:01.884
Ashley:
Hey, honey!

08:01.951 --> 08:02.785
Caleb:
Hey, babe.

08:02.852 --> 08:04.219
Just stand back.

08:04.288 --> 08:05.888
(Hard whack, wood clatters)

08:05.955 --> 08:08.591
Uh... I was thinking.

08:08.659 --> 08:11.160
I mean, look at this place.

08:11.227 --> 08:13.795
It breaks my heart
to just walk away from it.

08:13.862 --> 08:15.229
Yeah, me too.

08:15.298 --> 08:16.598
And that's just it.

08:16.666 --> 08:20.001
I could probably get
a good price on my ring

08:20.068 --> 08:21.903
and my car. What?
You need your car,

08:21.970 --> 08:24.105
and your ring?
Just don't even go there.

08:24.173 --> 08:25.740
Okay.

08:25.808 --> 08:27.641
So how about I ask my mom?

08:27.709 --> 08:30.277
No. I already told you,
we don't need her help.

08:30.345 --> 08:31.545
I've got a plan.

08:31.613 --> 08:33.614
What, by...

08:33.682 --> 08:35.015
Chopping up the sign

08:35.082 --> 08:36.883
thinking that'll make
the problem go away?

08:36.951 --> 08:38.518
No. But...

08:38.585 --> 08:40.620
At least I'm buying us
some time.

08:40.688 --> 08:43.123
Less people will know
the place is for sale.

08:43.191 --> 08:44.825
Buy time for what?

08:44.892 --> 08:47.227
I enter twice as many
rodeo events,

08:47.295 --> 08:48.728
expect to win everything.

08:48.796 --> 08:51.965
We cut our living expenses
to the bone...

08:52.033 --> 08:53.032
A couple of months,

08:53.099 --> 08:54.166
we'll have a decent
down payment.

08:54.234 --> 08:55.767
Okay...

08:55.836 --> 08:57.502
Yeah. Sure.

08:57.570 --> 09:00.172
Besides, it's free firewood.

09:00.240 --> 09:02.541
Every little bit counts.

09:02.608 --> 09:04.977
(Hard whack, wood clatters)

09:06.579 --> 09:08.780
You need more money...

09:09.748 --> 09:12.283
So, you're gonna work less?

09:12.351 --> 09:13.885
Yeah, I gotta cut back
on my hours

09:13.953 --> 09:15.053
so I can free up some time.

09:15.120 --> 09:18.789
And rodeo your way
to a down payment?

09:18.858 --> 09:20.424
I know, that's a nice piece
of property,

09:20.492 --> 09:22.227
but you might be giving up
a sure thing

09:22.294 --> 09:23.427
for an iffy thing here.

09:23.495 --> 09:25.162
Yeah, I just...

09:25.230 --> 09:27.464
I can't afford to think
negative right now.

09:27.531 --> 09:29.399
Gotta stay focused.

09:29.467 --> 09:32.736
Starting with the jackpot
this weekend.

09:32.803 --> 09:34.437
25 buck entry fee,

09:35.373 --> 09:37.241
winner takes half the pot.

09:37.308 --> 09:38.775
Well, the competition's
mostly local,

09:38.843 --> 09:41.210
so you got a shot.
Who's your partner?

09:41.278 --> 09:42.845
I don't know.

09:42.913 --> 09:46.148
Well, most of my regular guys
are partnered up already.

09:46.216 --> 09:47.383
Thought about a girl?

09:47.450 --> 09:48.817
Worked out pretty good
last time.

09:48.886 --> 09:51.387
You know, that might not be
a bad idea.

09:51.454 --> 09:52.554
Is Amy around?

09:52.622 --> 09:54.623
Uh, no.
You just missed here.

09:54.691 --> 09:57.558
She's... something about
someone's colt.

09:57.626 --> 09:58.860
Busy schedule, huh?

09:58.928 --> 10:01.662
Yeah.
Don't know how she manages.

10:01.730 --> 10:02.797
All right.

10:05.067 --> 10:07.568
Entry fee's $25, not $19.

10:08.704 --> 10:10.872
Square up when I win.

10:11.807 --> 10:13.374
(Truck door shuts)

10:15.043 --> 10:16.743
Lisa: Here we go
, help yourself.

10:16.811 --> 10:17.912
Careful! It's hot.

10:17.979 --> 10:19.179
Mallory:
Thank you.

10:19.247 --> 10:21.215
So, how's Dexter doing?

10:21.283 --> 10:23.083
Amy:
Uh, he's coming along slowly.

10:23.151 --> 10:25.786
But dad's not exactly
the most patient guy

10:25.853 --> 10:26.787
in the world.

10:26.854 --> 10:28.488
Oh. No kidding.

10:28.556 --> 10:30.290
Tendon injuries
are kind of tricky.

10:30.357 --> 10:32.358
They can take a while to heal.

10:32.426 --> 10:34.961
Amy: Yeah. But I still can't
believe he's thinking of selling him.

10:35.029 --> 10:36.662
Oh? He is?

10:36.730 --> 10:39.598
Yeah, I bet now you're glad
you unloaded that horse.

10:39.666 --> 10:41.000
I didn't "unload" him.

10:41.068 --> 10:43.069
As I recall, someone talked me
into selling him

10:43.137 --> 10:45.270
for next to nothing.

10:46.172 --> 10:48.606
Well, Mallory, I haven't
seen Jake around lately.

10:48.674 --> 10:51.643
I kind of miss
those driving lessons.

10:51.710 --> 10:53.412
Kid was getting good.

10:53.479 --> 10:56.982
He's busy...
Roping with Jamie.

10:58.484 --> 11:00.052
The rodeo club girl.

11:00.119 --> 11:01.419
Oh.

11:01.486 --> 11:03.487
Yeah, there's lots
of mixed teams this year.

11:03.555 --> 11:05.489
Good to know.

11:05.557 --> 11:07.491
Jack: Even Caleb's thinking
about roping with a girl again.

11:07.559 --> 11:10.661
Yeah, Amy, you should get
your rope out of retirement.

11:10.728 --> 11:13.965
Yeah, I mean if he needs
a partner.

11:14.032 --> 11:16.300
Come on, you guys did great
last time.

11:16.368 --> 11:18.501
If he's looking for a girl,
who else is he gonna ask?

11:18.569 --> 11:19.602
(Dishes clank)

11:21.572 --> 11:24.074
(Door thuds shut,
birds chirp and sing)

11:24.141 --> 11:25.208
(Hooves thud nearby)

11:29.217 --> 11:31.052
Kit:
Hey, Caleb,

11:31.119 --> 11:32.553
I got something for shorty.

11:32.620 --> 11:33.687
Gel pad.

11:33.755 --> 11:35.521
Thanks, but, um...

11:35.589 --> 11:38.325
Well, it turns out
there's no real rush anymore.

11:38.392 --> 11:40.193
What about the jackpot?

11:40.261 --> 11:41.328
Called everyone I know.

11:41.395 --> 11:43.596
Just came up empty this time.

11:43.664 --> 11:47.533
You ask Amy?
Or...She too busy?

11:47.601 --> 11:50.336
You saw the way
she blew me off the other day.

11:50.403 --> 11:52.304
Hey, you used to so some roping,
didn't you?

11:52.372 --> 11:54.239
I can't believe
you're asking me that!

11:54.307 --> 11:59.445
Come on, three time Alberta
High School Rodeo All-Star?

12:03.916 --> 12:05.317
So, uh...

12:06.218 --> 12:09.020
What do you care
if Jake's roping with Jamie?

12:09.088 --> 12:10.321
I don't.

12:11.656 --> 12:13.157
Yeah, but you gotta wonder

12:13.225 --> 12:14.725
what a hot girl like her's
doing with a guy like him,

12:14.793 --> 12:15.994
right?

12:16.061 --> 12:17.495
Hot?

12:17.562 --> 12:19.130
You think she's hot?

12:19.198 --> 12:20.664
Well, yeah.

12:21.933 --> 12:24.468
Like I said, what do you care?

12:24.535 --> 12:26.003
You got a boyfriend, right?

12:26.070 --> 12:28.838
What are you talking about?

12:31.242 --> 12:32.842
Oh...

12:32.910 --> 12:35.345
Okay, I just said that
because...

12:35.413 --> 12:36.880
Nevermind.
I have stuff...

12:36.947 --> 12:39.181
I, I've gotta go do.

12:43.553 --> 12:46.222
(Screen door squeaks and shuts)

12:49.926 --> 12:51.193
One question.

12:51.261 --> 12:52.328
Yeah.

12:52.396 --> 12:54.095
Why the hell didn't he ask me?

12:54.163 --> 12:55.897
Uh, who?
Ask you what?

12:55.964 --> 12:57.265
Tim! It's true.

12:57.333 --> 12:59.000
He is selling my horse.

12:59.068 --> 13:00.168
What horse?

13:00.236 --> 13:01.602
(Annoyed sigh)
Lightning Dexter.

13:01.670 --> 13:03.338
The one that he practically
stole from me.

13:03.406 --> 13:05.440
(Sighing) Oh jeez.
Here we go again.

13:05.508 --> 13:06.874
No, but, Jack, I mean it.

13:06.942 --> 13:08.476
After all I've been through
with that horse,

13:08.544 --> 13:09.977
I should be first in line.

13:10.045 --> 13:12.312
I'm sure he was probably
gonna ask you

13:12.380 --> 13:14.014
sooner or later.
But sooner or later,

13:14.082 --> 13:15.715
what if he sells it
to someone else?

13:15.783 --> 13:17.884
Well then, make him an offer.

13:17.952 --> 13:19.053
But then he knows
I'm interested,

13:19.120 --> 13:21.088
and I know
he'll inflate the price.

13:21.156 --> 13:22.289
So I think we just have to wait

13:22.357 --> 13:24.591
until he makes the first move.

13:24.659 --> 13:25.692
We?!

13:27.127 --> 13:29.029
I think he might need
a little push.

13:29.096 --> 13:31.397
And you want me
to do the pushing

13:31.465 --> 13:32.899
so you can buy a lame horse?

13:32.967 --> 13:34.434
Let it go, Lise.

13:34.501 --> 13:36.036
I'm not gonna let it go!

13:36.103 --> 13:37.236
I wanna see his face

13:37.304 --> 13:38.605
when I'm standing
in the winner's circle

13:38.673 --> 13:42.341
with a horse that he practically
had to give away!

13:43.610 --> 13:45.711
I will talk to Tim.

13:47.847 --> 13:52.317
But you won't let him know
that I'm interested.

13:53.553 --> 13:57.489
Jack: So I hear you're
thinking about selling Dexter.

13:57.557 --> 13:59.356
(Metallic clang, Tim grunts)

13:59.424 --> 14:01.459
Yeah, I'm thinking about it.

14:01.526 --> 14:03.561
I don't know who'd be crazy
enough to buy a race horse

14:03.629 --> 14:05.730
who can't race anymore,

14:05.798 --> 14:06.998
no matter what the price.

14:07.066 --> 14:08.967
Well, the way I remember it,

14:09.034 --> 14:10.668
when you first bought
that horse

14:10.736 --> 14:13.004
it looked like
his racing days were over.

14:13.072 --> 14:15.271
Hell, even Lisa regrets
selling him.

14:16.774 --> 14:17.674
What are you saying, Jack?

14:17.742 --> 14:18.942
Lisa wants to buy him back?

14:19.010 --> 14:21.511
No, I did not say that.

14:22.446 --> 14:24.781
But... (Sighs)

14:24.849 --> 14:27.283
Who knows what she might do

14:27.351 --> 14:30.920
if the opportunity
presented itself?

14:35.125 --> 14:36.158
(Broom swishes)

14:37.127 --> 14:38.494
You know that thing I said?

14:38.561 --> 14:40.496
That whole boyfriend thing?

14:40.563 --> 14:42.364
That's just something
I kinda blurted out.

14:42.432 --> 14:43.666
I do that.

14:44.567 --> 14:46.068
Look, I figured
you were just saying it

14:46.136 --> 14:48.103
to get back
at your old boyfriend.

14:48.170 --> 14:49.403
Jake?

14:49.471 --> 14:52.573
No way.
He was never even my boyfriend.

14:52.642 --> 14:54.275
Sure.
Whatever.

14:54.343 --> 14:56.410
Whatever?
What do you mean, whatever?

14:56.478 --> 14:58.446
Whatever.
Like I don't believe you.

14:58.514 --> 14:59.948
Yeah?

15:00.016 --> 15:02.283
Then what about this?

15:07.689 --> 15:10.891
If I was really into Jake,
would I have done that?

15:10.959 --> 15:12.760
I... guess not.

15:19.933 --> 15:20.967
Caleb:
Amy!

15:23.771 --> 15:25.237
Hey, guys!

15:25.305 --> 15:26.973
Hey.

15:27.041 --> 15:28.074
Caleb: Look, I know
you're busy these days,

15:28.142 --> 15:29.508
but I was hoping I could maybe

15:29.576 --> 15:30.509
just squeeze
a little bit of time

15:30.577 --> 15:31.477
out of your schedule?

15:31.545 --> 15:32.912
Mm, told ya.

15:32.980 --> 15:35.147
Yeah, 'cause I need someone
to pick up the slack

15:35.214 --> 15:36.414
for me around here.

15:36.482 --> 15:38.249
Gotta take a couple of days
off to practice.

15:38.317 --> 15:39.685
Practice what?

15:39.752 --> 15:41.086
Team roping with Kit.

15:41.154 --> 15:42.220
What else?

15:43.289 --> 15:45.123
Oh.

15:45.191 --> 15:46.491
Yeah, of course.

15:46.559 --> 15:48.459
Cool.
Well, thanks a lot, man.

15:48.527 --> 15:51.662
I really, really appreciate it.

15:55.233 --> 15:56.600
Is he serious?

15:56.668 --> 15:58.468
Team roping with Kit!

15:58.536 --> 16:00.204
We did so well
at the Hudson rodeo last year.

16:00.271 --> 16:01.405
He won all around cowboy
'cause of me

16:01.472 --> 16:02.907
and now he's roping with Kit,

16:02.974 --> 16:04.274
a second rate barrel racer?!

16:04.342 --> 16:05.576
Come on, Amy.

16:05.643 --> 16:07.243
(Sighs heavily)

16:07.311 --> 16:09.512
But I wish both of them
the best of luck.

16:09.580 --> 16:11.347
I hope they do well.

16:18.078 --> 16:21.413
Caleb: Yah-yah!
Kit: Hey, hey-hey-hey!

16:21.480 --> 16:22.514
Caleb:
Got him!

16:22.581 --> 16:24.016
Okay, Kit, he's yours.

16:24.083 --> 16:25.417
(Steer moos)

16:25.484 --> 16:26.584
Kit:
Oh man!

16:29.422 --> 16:31.023
Dammit.

16:31.090 --> 16:32.791
Dammit!
Let's go again.

16:32.859 --> 16:33.859
And maybe, you know what?

16:33.927 --> 16:34.959
This time you can catch
the steer

16:35.027 --> 16:36.694
before he's halfway
down the arena.

16:36.761 --> 16:39.130
Well, why don't we just
try switching it up?

16:39.198 --> 16:40.497
When I teamed up with Amy,

16:40.565 --> 16:41.565
she was the header
and I was the heeler.

16:41.633 --> 16:42.967
What are we doing here?

16:43.035 --> 16:44.668
Are we roping
or talking about Amy Fleming?

16:49.341 --> 16:50.841
(Hay bales rustle)

16:53.410 --> 16:55.045
Mallory: What're you doing?
Are you nuts?

16:55.112 --> 16:56.746
I'm just trying to help you.

16:56.814 --> 17:00.083
Mallory: Okay, well don't!
What if someone sees?

17:00.151 --> 17:03.053
It's not like we're official.

17:03.120 --> 17:04.753
Wait...

17:04.821 --> 17:06.223
We're not?

17:06.290 --> 17:08.991
I mean, it's not like
we never went on a date?

17:09.059 --> 17:11.792
Or, you know,
almost died in that well?

17:11.862 --> 17:13.428
Or got busted
for that stolen car?

17:13.496 --> 17:14.864
That car was stolen?

17:14.931 --> 17:17.833
And it's not like
I kissed you or anything.

17:17.901 --> 17:21.403
I know; That's why
I wanna take it slow.

17:21.471 --> 17:22.738
Take what slow?

17:22.805 --> 17:23.738
What is the it?

17:23.805 --> 17:24.805
I don't know yet.

17:24.874 --> 17:27.575
That's why I just wanna
go slow.

17:27.642 --> 17:29.210
Uh...

17:29.278 --> 17:31.112
O-kay.

17:31.180 --> 17:32.213
(Hay rustles)

17:37.086 --> 17:38.886
(Truck door shuts)

17:38.953 --> 17:40.787
Jack: Well, you wanted
me to look at something.

17:40.855 --> 17:43.190
What am I looking at?

17:44.625 --> 17:45.692
This.

17:46.694 --> 17:47.794
Beautiful, huh?

17:47.862 --> 17:50.697
I drive by here
pretty much every day.

17:50.765 --> 17:53.901
So you know it's being
subdivided into estate lots?

17:53.968 --> 17:56.068
Yeah.
Yeah, damn shame.

17:57.037 --> 17:58.371
Yeah, (Sighs)

17:58.438 --> 18:01.007
That's exactly
what I'm thinking, Jack.

18:01.074 --> 18:03.842
And do you know what else
I'm thinking?

18:03.911 --> 18:08.314
I'm thinking someone oughta
buy the whole thing.

18:08.382 --> 18:10.249
Just to keep it the way it is?

18:10.317 --> 18:11.983
Ashley asked me
to help her buy the lot

18:12.051 --> 18:13.818
that dreadful trailer is on.

18:13.886 --> 18:15.086
Caleb got wind of it.

18:15.154 --> 18:17.289
Long story short,
she asked me to back off.

18:17.356 --> 18:19.057
So where do I come in?

18:19.125 --> 18:20.058
You're my best friend;

18:20.126 --> 18:21.192
you're supposed to tell me

18:21.260 --> 18:22.360
that I'm doing
the right thing here.

18:22.428 --> 18:23.561
By helping your daughter

18:23.629 --> 18:27.031
when she doesn't want
your help?

18:27.098 --> 18:28.498
Jack, it's not about the money.

18:28.566 --> 18:30.367
It's not about the land.

18:30.435 --> 18:32.236
Caleb is trying to shut me
out of my daughter's life

18:32.304 --> 18:34.405
and it's killing me.

18:35.807 --> 18:37.207
Who are you trying
to convince here, Val?

18:37.275 --> 18:38.409
You? Or me?

18:38.476 --> 18:39.576
(Half laughs)

18:41.012 --> 18:42.946
You know me too well.

18:43.880 --> 18:45.614
(Wind chimes tinkle)

18:52.089 --> 18:54.257
Rough day at the office?

18:54.325 --> 18:56.459
Whole lot better now.

18:56.526 --> 18:58.094
This guy came
into Maggie's today...

18:58.162 --> 18:59.661
a Wyatt something.

18:59.728 --> 19:00.795
He says he knows you.

19:00.863 --> 19:01.997
Wyatt?
(Grunts)

19:02.865 --> 19:04.232
I didn't know
he's back in town?

19:04.300 --> 19:07.002
Did he give you a number?
He's a great roper.

19:07.070 --> 19:08.670
Except you already have
a partner.

19:08.737 --> 19:10.105
Oh yeah. Kit.

19:11.007 --> 19:13.675
You know, I even bought her
a stupid pink rope.

19:13.742 --> 19:15.542
What's the matter?
Wrong shade of pink?

19:15.610 --> 19:16.877
Very funny.

19:17.612 --> 19:19.246
If I wanna win,
I've gotta team up with someone

19:19.314 --> 19:22.049
that doesn't get all moody
and make stupid mistakes.

19:22.117 --> 19:24.452
You mean like Wyatt?

19:30.658 --> 19:32.425
Hey, Caleb.

19:32.493 --> 19:34.427
Remember when you dumped Kit?

19:34.495 --> 19:36.662
What? You gonna take
a swing at me again?

19:36.730 --> 19:37.998
'Cause the statute
of limitations on that one

19:38.065 --> 19:41.267
ran out a long time- no.
No, man. (Sighs)

19:41.335 --> 19:43.436
I just wondered how
you pulled it off.

19:43.504 --> 19:44.604
Because, you know,

19:44.671 --> 19:47.839
you and Kit are still friends.

19:47.907 --> 19:48.840
Okay. I thought it was
a good idea

19:48.908 --> 19:50.075
to team up with her

19:50.143 --> 19:52.777
and now I've got
a better option.

19:52.845 --> 19:54.613
But I don't wanna wreck
our relationship,

19:54.680 --> 19:56.081
so, I...

19:56.816 --> 20:00.719
Was sort of thinking maybe
you could, you know.

20:00.786 --> 20:02.421
You want me do it for you?

20:02.489 --> 20:04.322
Yeah. I mean, since you're
so damn good at it.

20:04.390 --> 20:08.092
Forget it, man.
You do it yourself.

20:08.160 --> 20:10.228
Yeah.
You're right.

20:10.295 --> 20:11.829
Yeah, I don't know
what I was thinking.

20:11.897 --> 20:13.464
You know, with any luck,
it'll go straight to message.

20:13.532 --> 20:15.299
You don't call her.

20:15.367 --> 20:17.435
You do it face to face;
In person.

20:17.503 --> 20:18.836
You owe her that.

20:18.904 --> 20:21.771
It's not a voice mail
situation then.

20:21.839 --> 20:22.939
No.

20:23.841 --> 20:27.310
You know,
you really know your stuff.

20:27.378 --> 20:28.945
Thanks, man.

20:31.882 --> 20:32.815
(Sighs)

20:32.883 --> 20:34.617
What was that about?

20:34.685 --> 20:36.885
You don't wanna know.

20:38.888 --> 20:40.556
Tim:
Hey, Dan?

20:40.623 --> 20:42.258
Dan. I, uh...

20:42.325 --> 20:43.492
Well, I thought you
might wanna know,

20:43.560 --> 20:45.327
given your interest
in my horse.

20:45.395 --> 20:47.163
What horse?
What're you talking about?

20:47.230 --> 20:49.065
Dexter.

20:49.132 --> 20:50.666
Oh.

20:50.733 --> 20:52.133
The comeback kid.

20:52.201 --> 20:53.601
Yeah.

20:53.669 --> 20:54.635
Well, the thing is...

20:54.703 --> 20:57.105
Um, he's on the mend,

20:58.074 --> 21:00.542
but I've been thinking
about what you said,

21:00.609 --> 21:02.510
you know, and you're right.

21:02.578 --> 21:06.314
This business might be
a little rich for my blood,

21:06.382 --> 21:08.449
so I'm thinking of selling him.

21:08.516 --> 21:09.883
To who?

21:09.951 --> 21:11.785
A kill buyer?

21:11.852 --> 21:13.053
Tim, now listen to me.

21:13.121 --> 21:14.054
I mean, for the money you get,

21:14.122 --> 21:15.322
you might as well just...

21:15.390 --> 21:17.324
Put a bullet through his head
yourself.

21:17.392 --> 21:20.026
(Laughs) Well, actually,
your ex-wife is interested.

21:20.095 --> 21:21.328
(Chuckles)

21:21.396 --> 21:23.162
Lisa?

21:23.230 --> 21:25.264
That's typical.

21:25.332 --> 21:27.600
What kind of money are
we talking about here, Tim?

21:27.667 --> 21:30.269
Well, that's...
That's confidential.

21:30.337 --> 21:32.338
But... you know Lisa,

21:33.307 --> 21:34.740
she can be pretty generous.

21:34.808 --> 21:36.008
Dan:
(Laughs)

21:37.077 --> 21:40.278
Generous? Yeah, yeah...
And fickle.

21:40.346 --> 21:41.613
I can't tell you
the number of times

21:41.680 --> 21:44.015
she's just backed out of a deal,

21:44.083 --> 21:46.318
including our marriage.

21:46.385 --> 21:47.952
Well, that's good to know.

21:48.020 --> 21:49.087
Mmm.

21:50.055 --> 21:52.257
So, what do you think?

21:53.926 --> 21:56.193
Do you want to buy him?

21:56.261 --> 21:58.162
Well, Tim, (Clears throat)

21:58.230 --> 22:01.565
I'd be doing you and that horse
a, a big favour.

22:02.467 --> 22:04.801
But I've gotta warn you,

22:04.869 --> 22:07.904
I didn't get rich
by just throwing money away.

22:07.972 --> 22:09.740
Oh, obviously.

22:11.509 --> 22:14.010
(Low hum of chatter)

22:14.077 --> 22:16.112
Hey, Kit.
Hey.

22:16.180 --> 22:18.548
I, uh, heard about you
and Caleb.

22:18.616 --> 22:21.083
Oh yeah? I'm just gonna
have coffee with him.

22:21.152 --> 22:23.286
So you're not mad at him?

22:23.354 --> 22:25.121
Mad about what?

22:26.290 --> 22:27.689
I don't know, I just figured...

22:27.757 --> 22:30.225
You know Caleb, he's...

22:31.194 --> 22:33.328
Boy, you're a terrible liar.

22:33.396 --> 22:35.330
I'm sure he wants
to tell you himself.

22:35.398 --> 22:36.831
Yeah, he's dumping me,
isn't he?

22:36.899 --> 22:38.833
For you!
No, not for me.

22:38.901 --> 22:42.204
Kit, look, I shouldn't have
said anything.

22:42.272 --> 22:43.804
Caleb:
Hey, Kit.

22:43.872 --> 22:44.938
Amy.

22:46.642 --> 22:49.443
What's wrong with you guys?

22:52.648 --> 22:54.382
(Gate clunks)

22:54.849 --> 22:57.618
Tim: Hey, your buddy Dan
Hartfield's been sniffing around.

22:57.686 --> 22:59.053
Jack:
He's not a buddy of mine.

22:59.120 --> 23:01.120
Well, he's real interested
in Dexter.

23:01.189 --> 23:02.656
I'm not getting involved.

23:02.723 --> 23:03.990
What if you were?
I'm not.

23:04.058 --> 23:05.692
But if you were?

23:05.759 --> 23:07.527
Then I'd say that Lisa'd be
more than a little disappointed

23:07.595 --> 23:09.095
if you sold that horse to Dan.

23:09.163 --> 23:10.430
That's just it, Jack.

23:10.498 --> 23:12.765
Because you know me,

23:12.833 --> 23:14.401
I'd rather not sell Dexter
at all.

23:14.468 --> 23:16.235
But Dan's made me
a substantial offer

23:16.303 --> 23:18.571
and I might just have
to go for it.

23:18.638 --> 23:20.472
Well, that makes perfect sense.

23:20.540 --> 23:22.641
No matter what the cost
of friendship,

23:22.709 --> 23:23.875
family.

23:23.943 --> 23:27.145
Obviously, I wanna sell
the horse to Lisa,

23:27.214 --> 23:29.315
if she made a fair offer.

23:29.382 --> 23:31.649
I do not like the guy.

23:31.717 --> 23:33.851
Treats me like
I'm a small time hustler.

23:33.919 --> 23:35.653
(Under his breath)
Small potatoes.

23:35.721 --> 23:36.654
What was that?

23:36.722 --> 23:37.655
Small potatoes.

23:37.723 --> 23:38.856
What do you mean?

23:38.924 --> 23:40.124
That's what he called my place!

23:40.192 --> 23:42.059
That's exactly
what he called my place!

23:42.127 --> 23:44.161
Small pota-
600 acres!

23:44.230 --> 23:46.063
That sound like
small potatoes to you?

23:46.131 --> 23:49.032
It'd be a shame
if I had to sell to that guy.

23:53.037 --> 23:54.238
Ty:
You told Kit?

23:54.305 --> 23:55.706
Well, I thought
she already knew!

23:55.773 --> 23:57.107
And by the time
I realized she didn't,

23:57.174 --> 23:58.108
it was too late.

23:58.175 --> 23:59.610
Ty:
(Sighs)

23:59.677 --> 24:00.644
You know, you're way better
with horses

24:00.712 --> 24:02.178
than you are with people.

24:02.247 --> 24:04.179
I can't believe I thought
Caleb was gonna ask me!

24:04.248 --> 24:06.515
Kit:
Hey, consider yourself lucky.

24:06.583 --> 24:08.584
I mean, at least he didn't
lead you on.

24:08.652 --> 24:09.952
Right?

24:10.019 --> 24:11.520
I was actually practicing
with the guy.

24:11.588 --> 24:12.921
You know what
the worst part is?

24:12.989 --> 24:14.257
Now that shorty's
going good again,

24:14.324 --> 24:16.325
Caleb's gonna be
really hard to beat.

24:16.393 --> 24:17.727
You still gonna enter?

24:17.794 --> 24:19.494
Yeah, damn right.

24:19.562 --> 24:20.762
It's not just about
the money either.

24:20.829 --> 24:22.530
I wanna see Odell choke.

24:22.598 --> 24:25.533
Who're you gonna
partner up with?

24:25.601 --> 24:26.701
Wow, Ty's right.

24:26.769 --> 24:29.671
You're way better with horses.

24:40.276 --> 24:41.943
Kit:
Come on! Get him!

24:45.181 --> 24:46.881
Amy: Come on!
Kit: Oh man!

24:46.949 --> 24:49.183
(Gate clatters, steers moo)

24:51.519 --> 24:52.919
Kit:
Oh, come on!

24:54.322 --> 24:55.789
Amy:
Okay, now!

24:55.856 --> 24:57.291
Kit:
Keep the rope tight.

24:57.358 --> 24:58.792
Amy:
It is.

24:59.627 --> 25:01.495
Kit: I said,
keep the rope tight.

25:01.563 --> 25:02.629
(Steer moos)

25:06.866 --> 25:09.768
What the hell are you doing?

25:09.836 --> 25:10.669
I got my job done.

25:10.737 --> 25:11.870
(Sardonic chuckle)

25:11.938 --> 25:13.206
I don't think you know
what your job is

25:13.273 --> 25:15.708
because if you did,
I could do mine!

25:15.775 --> 25:17.776
I'm not the one
who dropped my dallies.

25:17.844 --> 25:19.979
Yeah, 'cause you don't listen
to anybody, okay?

25:20.046 --> 25:21.246
I told you to keep
the rope tight...

25:21.314 --> 25:22.780
I did keep the rope tight!

25:22.848 --> 25:24.015
You're the one who doesn't
know what you're doing.

25:24.083 --> 25:25.650
Oh, I don't know
what I'm doing.

25:25.718 --> 25:26.951
I don't know what I'm doing?

25:27.019 --> 25:29.254
I never saw you once
at any high school rodeo;

25:29.322 --> 25:30.722
I never saw you once
on the circuit;

25:30.789 --> 25:32.424
and now you're the big
rodeo expert?

25:32.492 --> 25:34.859
Yeah, yeah,
this was a huge mistake!

25:34.927 --> 25:36.360
You're damn right it was.

25:36.428 --> 25:37.728
You know, you don't know
how to work with anyone!

25:37.795 --> 25:38.496
I can't believe I thought
this was a good idea

25:38.563 --> 25:39.530
in the first place!

25:39.598 --> 25:40.964
You didn't.
I did.

25:41.032 --> 25:42.199
Oh, so now you're arguing
about who said what?

25:42.267 --> 25:43.734
You know what?
This definitely not gonna work.

25:43.801 --> 25:44.835
(Horse clops away)

25:45.903 --> 25:46.970
(Exhales)

25:50.975 --> 25:53.376
You're not working Saturday?

25:53.444 --> 25:54.877
It's my day off.

25:54.945 --> 25:56.279
Is there a problem?

25:56.347 --> 25:57.447
Well, I just thought
you would come with me

25:57.515 --> 25:59.549
to the jackpot.

25:59.617 --> 26:01.551
You never asked me.

26:01.619 --> 26:03.219
Well, I was gonna ask you.

26:03.287 --> 26:05.054
And Jack wanted me to help out

26:05.122 --> 26:08.490
and I kind of already
volunteered you too.

26:08.558 --> 26:12.294
But, uh, I thought we were
taking it slow, right?

26:13.396 --> 26:15.697
So slow
that I made other plans.

26:15.765 --> 26:17.566
Okay. Whatever.

26:19.769 --> 26:20.802
But...

26:22.738 --> 26:26.207
I can change those plans,
if you want me to.

26:29.044 --> 26:32.046
Well, don't do me any favours.

26:32.947 --> 26:34.348
But okay.

26:45.259 --> 26:47.561
Mm, what a beautiful evening.

26:47.628 --> 26:48.595
Yeah.

26:51.098 --> 26:53.200
What's the matter?

26:54.302 --> 26:55.335
Nothing.

26:55.403 --> 26:56.669
Come on, I know that face.

26:56.736 --> 26:59.771
It's like you got a burr
in your boot.

26:59.839 --> 27:01.273
(Sighs)

27:01.341 --> 27:03.375
Okay, if you really wanna know.

27:03.443 --> 27:04.776
Oh...

27:04.844 --> 27:06.044
Is it Tim?

27:06.112 --> 27:07.346
Did you talk to him?

27:07.414 --> 27:10.349
He's trying to use me
as a go-between

27:10.417 --> 27:14.652
to start a bidding war
between you and Dan.

27:14.720 --> 27:16.153
What?!

27:16.222 --> 27:18.122
Dan is bidding Dexter?

27:19.024 --> 27:21.192
(Derisive laugh)
Oh-ho-ho-ho...

27:21.260 --> 27:23.294
He didn't have one nice thing
to say about that horse

27:23.362 --> 27:25.162
when I owned him!

27:26.098 --> 27:27.998
He told me I was wasting
my money so many times

27:28.066 --> 27:29.933
I started to believe him.

27:30.000 --> 27:31.401
See?

27:31.469 --> 27:34.438
Well, I shouldn't have even
said anything.

27:34.505 --> 27:36.306
But you did.

27:36.374 --> 27:37.441
Yeah, I did.

27:37.508 --> 27:40.009
Pffft!
Boy, the two of them.

27:42.813 --> 27:44.580
Amy: I tried.
Okay, I did.

27:44.648 --> 27:46.148
But you don't know
what Kit's like

27:46.216 --> 27:49.285
when she's not pretending
to be all perky and smiley!

27:49.353 --> 27:51.086
And I'm not saying
she's a bad roper,

27:51.154 --> 27:52.588
'cause she's actually
pretty good.

27:52.656 --> 27:53.856
This is between you two.

27:53.923 --> 27:55.591
Ty, she's just so bossy.

27:55.659 --> 27:56.592
Every time something
went wrong,

27:56.660 --> 27:58.160
she blamed me.

27:58.228 --> 27:59.161
I never thought
it was a good idea

27:59.229 --> 28:00.395
in the first place.

28:00.463 --> 28:02.464
Well then, why didn't you
say something?

28:02.531 --> 28:03.931
Because you wouldn't
have listened to me.

28:03.999 --> 28:06.167
That's exactly what Kit said!

28:06.235 --> 28:07.669
She said that I don't listen;

28:07.737 --> 28:09.837
that I think I know everything.

28:09.905 --> 28:10.972
Yeah...

28:12.708 --> 28:14.276
Oh, so you're agreeing
with her are you?

28:14.343 --> 28:17.444
All I'm trying to say is,
that Kit is very competitive.

28:17.512 --> 28:19.747
She takes this stuff
as seriously as you do.

28:19.814 --> 28:22.149
You guys would make
an awesome team

28:22.216 --> 28:23.850
if you can get over yourselves.

28:23.918 --> 28:27.621
So you are agreeing
with her then?

28:27.689 --> 28:28.789
(Laughs)

28:32.559 --> 28:33.793
(Low hum of chatter)

28:34.762 --> 28:35.861
Well, Dexter,

28:35.929 --> 28:38.564
how much are you gonna
cost me today?

28:38.632 --> 28:39.265
Lisa?

28:39.333 --> 28:40.900
Hi.
Hi.

28:40.967 --> 28:43.603
I would actually like
to buy Dexter back, Tim.

28:43.671 --> 28:46.406
And I will match whatever
that man is offering you.

28:46.473 --> 28:48.774
Oh, Lisa, come on,
you don't wanna do that.

28:48.841 --> 28:49.974
You don't wanna throw
your money away

28:50.042 --> 28:51.610
on a lame horse.

28:51.678 --> 28:52.944
The best thing for both of us

28:53.012 --> 28:54.379
is just let Dan buy him.

28:54.447 --> 28:56.782
Let him have the headache.

28:57.717 --> 29:00.552
Sure, okay.
You're right. Good.

29:00.620 --> 29:02.287
I will not match him;

29:02.355 --> 29:05.323
I'm gonna better him!
Got it?

29:06.725 --> 29:08.192
Lisa: Hi!
Dan: Lisa.

29:08.259 --> 29:09.960
Good to see ya!
You too!

29:10.862 --> 29:12.262
Gotta run.

29:19.604 --> 29:21.338
(Laughs)

29:21.405 --> 29:23.005
It's getting good.

29:23.073 --> 29:25.508
(Music plays,
low hum of chatter)

29:26.977 --> 29:28.445
Hey.
Hey.

29:28.512 --> 29:29.646
Real estate, huh?

29:29.714 --> 29:31.448
You and Caleb
thinking of moving?

29:31.515 --> 29:32.782
Never thought I'd say this,

29:32.850 --> 29:36.185
but I kind of love
that crummy trailer.

29:36.253 --> 29:39.755
But if it gets sold,
who knows what'll happen?

29:39.823 --> 29:40.922
Don't look now,

29:40.990 --> 29:42.691
but your favourite person's
coming in.

29:42.759 --> 29:44.593
Hey, Kit.
Over here.

29:44.661 --> 29:46.228
Man: I'll see ya.
Kit: See ya.

29:46.295 --> 29:47.229
Hey, Kit?

29:47.296 --> 29:49.264
It's complicated.

29:51.200 --> 29:52.300
(Sighs)

29:52.368 --> 29:53.835
Hey, can we grab
a couple of coffees?

29:53.902 --> 29:55.102
Ashley: Yeah. Sure.
Coming right up.

29:55.170 --> 29:56.270
Thanks.

29:57.205 --> 29:58.373
Okay, I'm here.

29:58.440 --> 30:00.241
What did you wanna
to talk about?

30:00.308 --> 30:01.743
All right.

30:01.810 --> 30:04.345
I've been thinking a lot
about what happened, all right,

30:04.413 --> 30:07.114
and I think we should
try again.

30:07.182 --> 30:08.482
I mean,
you're a good roper, Kit,

30:08.549 --> 30:11.017
and if we can just find a way
to work together,

30:11.085 --> 30:14.888
then we might just have
a shot at this.

30:17.792 --> 30:20.694
(Overlapping shouting
and chatter)

30:36.710 --> 30:38.043
(Steers moo, gate clanks)

30:38.111 --> 30:40.078
Jack: Let's go.
Here we go, come on.

30:40.146 --> 30:41.446
(Mooing)

30:41.514 --> 30:42.714
(Mic feedback squeals)

30:42.782 --> 30:44.549
Test.

30:44.617 --> 30:47.485
Okay, guys,
it's time to get started.

30:47.553 --> 30:49.854
We're gonna start off
with the youth category.

30:49.922 --> 30:51.423
Jack:
Go, go!

30:51.490 --> 30:54.225
(Cows moo,
Jack grunts urging on cows)

30:54.293 --> 30:57.127
Well, just as soon
as Mr. Jack Bartlett

30:57.194 --> 30:59.563
gets the damn steers
where they're supposed be.

30:59.631 --> 31:00.664
(Audience laughs)

31:02.166 --> 31:03.533
Tim Fleming.

31:03.600 --> 31:05.868
Never met a microphone
he didn't like.

31:05.936 --> 31:08.704
Next thing you know
he's gonna be singing karaoke.

31:11.341 --> 31:12.575
Amy.

31:12.643 --> 31:14.677
Here to cheer me on?

31:14.745 --> 31:15.812
Not exactly.

31:17.614 --> 31:18.514
You entered?

31:18.582 --> 31:20.048
Kit:
Yeah.

31:20.115 --> 31:21.215
With me.

31:22.318 --> 31:24.085
Caleb:
You two.

31:24.153 --> 31:25.887
Wow!

31:25.955 --> 31:27.789
Who'd have thought?

31:27.857 --> 31:29.524
So, no hard feelings then?

31:29.592 --> 31:31.326
No. None at all.

31:31.393 --> 31:33.394
Good. It worked out nice
for all of us.

31:33.463 --> 31:34.863
Yeah.

31:34.931 --> 31:37.865
But you will change your tune
when we whoop your ass.

31:37.933 --> 31:40.233
Yes, I will.
But, uh...

31:40.301 --> 31:42.736
I wouldn't count on that.

31:42.804 --> 31:45.005
Good luck though to both of ya.

31:47.642 --> 31:49.577
Why am I glad
we're on the same team?

31:49.644 --> 31:51.744
Yeah, for once.

31:51.812 --> 31:53.513
As long as you don't
mess it up.

32:00.395 --> 32:02.596
You stubborn, you stink!

32:05.232 --> 32:06.733
(Mooing)

32:06.800 --> 32:07.734
Hey, Mallory?

32:07.801 --> 32:10.170
You seen Jake around?

32:11.272 --> 32:13.740
So, Badger's gone
all cowboy, eh?

32:13.807 --> 32:15.208
Come on!
(Steer moos)

32:15.276 --> 32:16.943
(Badger grunts, Jamie laughs)

32:17.011 --> 32:18.345
Not really.

32:19.280 --> 32:21.280
He doesn't know
much about cows.

32:21.348 --> 32:22.481
Neither do you.

32:22.549 --> 32:24.216
That's a steer.

32:24.284 --> 32:26.218
Badger:
(Grunting)

32:27.154 --> 32:28.254
He is kinda cute, though.

32:30.223 --> 32:32.090
I gotta go find Jake,
get ready.

32:36.328 --> 32:37.928
Dan: Hey, you know, for
the money I spent,

32:37.996 --> 32:40.632
I, I expected
a little more than this.

32:40.699 --> 32:42.333
Well, I expected
a little more money.

32:42.401 --> 32:43.801
(Chuckles)

32:43.869 --> 32:45.403
Dan: Yeah, well, pleasantries aside,

32:45.471 --> 32:46.871
have you thought about
my offer yet?

32:46.938 --> 32:48.173
Yeah, I thought about it.

32:48.240 --> 32:50.007
But there's a problem.

32:50.075 --> 32:51.576
Lisa.

32:51.644 --> 32:53.277
Well, that's the story
of my life.

32:53.344 --> 32:55.379
You know, I knew
she was up to something.

32:55.446 --> 32:56.613
What is it this time?

32:56.681 --> 32:59.249
Well, she's prepared
to do better.

32:59.317 --> 33:00.317
Well, how much better?

33:00.385 --> 33:02.452
A lot better.

33:02.520 --> 33:04.388
Way better.

33:04.455 --> 33:05.889
For that lame old canner?

33:05.956 --> 33:08.424
Dan, what can I say?
You know women.

33:08.492 --> 33:12.261
When they fall in love
with a horse...

33:14.698 --> 33:17.200
(Steers moo,
Mallory and Badger grunt)

33:17.267 --> 33:21.237
Tim: Okay, this is the final
pair in the youth category,

33:21.305 --> 33:23.439
we got Jake Anderson
and Jamie Lewis.

33:23.507 --> 33:24.673
(Audience cheers)

33:24.740 --> 33:27.041
(Gates clunk, steer moos)

33:27.109 --> 33:28.577
(Audience whoops)

33:35.818 --> 33:37.151
(Steer moos)

33:37.220 --> 33:38.286
Tim:
And...

33:39.222 --> 33:40.588
(Audience whoops)

33:40.655 --> 33:43.190
Tim:
And that looks good.

33:44.125 --> 33:47.728
With a time of 14... 14.7.

33:47.795 --> 33:49.463
That's good enough
to put Jake and Jamie

33:49.531 --> 33:51.064
in first place
on the leader board.

33:51.132 --> 33:52.466
Jamie:
Yay! Yeah!

33:52.534 --> 33:53.767
Jake:
Awesome!

33:53.835 --> 33:56.236
(Audience cheers and applauds)

34:05.346 --> 34:06.979
(Horse snuffles)

34:07.047 --> 34:09.282
Jamie: Oh my gosh!
We won!

34:13.418 --> 34:14.819
So fun! Amazing!
(Laughs)

34:24.364 --> 34:25.330
Jack?

34:25.398 --> 34:26.998
Kinda busy here.

34:27.065 --> 34:28.632
Dan: Well, I suggest
you find the time

34:28.699 --> 34:30.735
to rein in your girlfriend.

34:31.637 --> 34:33.170
I'm sitting this one out, Dan.

34:33.237 --> 34:35.306
That woman turned
a simple horse trade

34:35.373 --> 34:36.641
into a bidding war.

34:37.576 --> 34:38.842
Now, if she doesn't back off,

34:38.909 --> 34:40.578
I'm gonna push the price
through the roof...

34:40.646 --> 34:42.446
I don't doubt that
for a minute.

34:42.514 --> 34:46.616
And then I'm gonna leave her
high and dry.

34:48.286 --> 34:51.788
And while we're at it, Jack,
that banner...

34:53.690 --> 34:56.426
Next time I sponsor
this damn event,

34:56.494 --> 34:58.728
I want a little bang
for my buck!

35:02.899 --> 35:04.633
Tim:
What was that all about?

35:04.701 --> 35:07.803
I think he's got a problem
with the size of his sign.

35:12.074 --> 35:13.742
(Steer moos loudly)

35:16.679 --> 35:17.712
(Mooing)

35:19.748 --> 35:23.318
(Gate clatters,
steer moos, horses whinny)

35:27.423 --> 35:29.023
Caleb:
Yeah!

35:29.090 --> 35:30.825
(Excited squeal)

35:30.892 --> 35:33.694
(Steer mooing,
Ashley squeals happily)

35:33.761 --> 35:35.128
Got it! Woo hoo!

35:35.196 --> 35:36.630
(Audience cheers)

35:39.600 --> 35:42.803
Tim: Okay, that's a pretty
good ride for Caleb Odell

35:42.870 --> 35:44.705
and Wyatt Thomlinson.

35:46.140 --> 35:48.507
That's, uh, 7.8 seconds.

35:49.476 --> 35:50.909
That puts them in first place.

35:50.977 --> 35:52.144
(Audience cheers)

35:53.079 --> 35:54.613
Woo! That's my boy!

35:55.549 --> 35:57.316
Yeah! Woo hoo!

36:03.056 --> 36:07.291
Tim: Last pair up,
Kit Bailey and Amy Fleming.

36:07.360 --> 36:11.496
(Crowd whoops and cheers,
horse and steer nicker)

36:15.634 --> 36:17.001
(Gate clatters)

36:17.069 --> 36:18.503
Kit and Amy: (Urge
horses on) Ay-ay! Yah!

36:18.571 --> 36:21.505
Amy:
Come on, come on, come on!

36:22.474 --> 36:24.941
Amy:
Yes, yes, yes, yes!

36:25.009 --> 36:26.109
Kit:
You got it, Amy?!

36:30.615 --> 36:31.615
Yes!

36:32.851 --> 36:34.217
Kit:
We got him!

36:34.285 --> 36:35.285
Ty:
Yeah!

36:35.353 --> 36:37.720
(Kit laughs, audience cheers)

36:39.623 --> 36:41.691
Tim: Look, folks, I swear, 
no favouritism here,

36:41.759 --> 36:44.960
but with a time
of 7.6 seconds...

36:45.028 --> 36:46.328
Amy Fleming and Kit Bailey

36:46.397 --> 36:48.664
just knocked one
out of the park.

36:48.732 --> 36:49.766
Wooo!

36:49.833 --> 36:51.066
Yeah-ha-ha!

36:51.134 --> 36:52.868
I can't believe
we just beat Caleb.

36:52.935 --> 36:55.203
Kit: We didn't just beat
Caleb, we beat everybody!

36:55.271 --> 36:56.337
(Laughs)

37:03.646 --> 37:06.247
We'll get 'em next time.

37:09.618 --> 37:12.553
Ty:
2010 Hudson team roping jackpot.

37:12.621 --> 37:14.054
Not bad.

37:14.122 --> 37:15.022
Kit: Yeah, I already
got a few of these,

37:15.089 --> 37:16.423
but I'm gonna be wearing
this one

37:16.490 --> 37:17.557
when I hit Montana.

37:17.625 --> 37:19.392
Montana?
What, you got a rodeo there?

37:19.460 --> 37:20.560
No. I got a fella.

37:21.562 --> 37:22.695
He's a bull-rider.

37:22.763 --> 37:23.897
A bull-rider.

37:23.964 --> 37:25.298
Hopefully a real one this time?

37:25.365 --> 37:26.433
Kit:
Well, that remains to be seen,

37:26.500 --> 37:28.802
but I'm willing
to give it a shot.

37:28.869 --> 37:30.937
Wow, girls, congratulations.

37:31.004 --> 37:32.038
You did great.

37:32.105 --> 37:34.139
Thanks.
It was so much fun.

37:34.206 --> 37:35.441
Fun? Really?

37:36.409 --> 37:38.944
It's not so fun
for Caleb and I.

37:39.011 --> 37:41.313
He wasn't in it
for the belt buckle.

37:41.380 --> 37:43.649
We actually need the money,
remember?

37:43.716 --> 37:44.983
We're trying to get
a down payment together

37:45.051 --> 37:47.553
so we won't get evicted.

37:47.620 --> 37:51.388
But hey, don't let that
ruin your fun.

37:57.463 --> 37:59.129
Tim:
Thanks, buddy.

38:00.833 --> 38:02.232
Hold up there, Tim.

38:03.268 --> 38:04.835
I wanna talk to you...

38:04.902 --> 38:06.470
About Dexter.

38:06.537 --> 38:09.973
What, you want to make me
an offer?

38:10.040 --> 38:11.140
You might say.

38:11.208 --> 38:14.143
Oh, Jack,
don't get involved in this.

38:14.211 --> 38:16.279
Because I'm telling ya,
it's gonna get ugly.

38:16.347 --> 38:18.247
Pffft!
Tell me about it.

38:18.315 --> 38:21.049
Lisa and Dan Hartfield
going head to head...

38:21.117 --> 38:22.417
You know what?

38:22.486 --> 38:23.218
I never thought
it was gonna get this far.

38:23.286 --> 38:24.219
Neither did I.

38:24.287 --> 38:27.122
But it has, so hear me out.

38:28.391 --> 38:30.593
I don't wanna buy Dexter.

38:31.561 --> 38:33.395
I don't want anybody
to buy Dexter

38:33.463 --> 38:34.797
to tell you the truth.

38:34.865 --> 38:36.698
Because I don't think you
really want to sell him.

38:36.765 --> 38:40.001
So, you're not buying,
I'm not selling?

38:40.068 --> 38:41.402
That's a great offer, Jack.

38:41.470 --> 38:46.674
What I am prepared to do
is board Dexter...

38:46.742 --> 38:47.909
for free...

38:47.977 --> 38:50.778
for as long as you own him.

38:51.847 --> 38:53.814
Ty and Amy,
they can handle the therapy

38:53.882 --> 38:56.383
and I'll provide the feed.

38:57.284 --> 39:00.487
That...
Sounds like a partnership.

39:00.555 --> 39:02.656
No, don't exactly see it
that way.

39:02.724 --> 39:04.024
No, no, no.

39:04.091 --> 39:07.227
No, I own the horse,
you pay the expenses;

39:07.294 --> 39:09.695
that sounds like a partnership.

39:09.763 --> 39:12.832
I mean, what else could you
possibly call it?

39:12.900 --> 39:13.966
A mistake.

39:14.935 --> 39:16.235
(Laughing)

39:21.374 --> 39:22.742
(Truck rumbles)

39:28.814 --> 39:30.248
(Sighs heavily)

39:30.315 --> 39:31.850
You can't win everything,
Caleb.

39:31.918 --> 39:34.653
Look, we could just ask
my mom for help.

39:34.720 --> 39:36.788
Forget it, ash.
I already told her no way.

39:36.856 --> 39:38.790
Yeah, well, guess what?

39:38.858 --> 39:40.291
I already talked to my mom.

39:40.359 --> 39:41.559
What?

39:41.626 --> 39:43.260
Yeah, I told her this place
was for sale,

39:43.327 --> 39:45.262
and she would've written me
a cheque right there...

39:45.329 --> 39:48.532
Ash... If it wasn't
for your macho pride.

39:48.600 --> 39:49.667
Ashley!

39:53.137 --> 39:55.205
It's already sold?!

39:56.140 --> 39:58.041
C'est la vie.

39:58.108 --> 40:00.543
It's one less thing
for us to fight about.

40:12.436 --> 40:13.903
Mallory?
What're you still doing here?

40:13.970 --> 40:15.838
I thought you left ages ago?

40:15.906 --> 40:18.541
I just gotta finish this up.

40:18.608 --> 40:20.242
So, you and Badger
we're having fun

40:20.310 --> 40:22.110
at the jackpot today.

40:22.178 --> 40:23.579
Yeah, I guess.

40:24.481 --> 40:26.247
Well, way to move on from Jake.

40:26.315 --> 40:27.849
That's just it.

40:27.917 --> 40:31.052
I'm not sure if I have
moved on from Jake.

40:31.119 --> 40:32.987
I mean...

40:33.055 --> 40:35.089
I mean, I like Badger.

40:35.157 --> 40:38.059
I really like Badger, but...

40:40.930 --> 40:42.796
Mallory,

40:42.864 --> 40:44.598
it's okay.

40:44.666 --> 40:46.266
But it's not okay!

40:47.168 --> 40:48.769
I don't know,
maybe it's just Jamie,

40:48.837 --> 40:52.506
but I can't stop
thinking about Jake!

40:54.976 --> 40:57.477
Amy, what am I gonna do
about Badger?

41:05.853 --> 41:08.220
(Dishes clank, music plays)

41:11.358 --> 41:13.025
Hey.

41:13.093 --> 41:14.860
What can I get you?

41:14.927 --> 41:16.094
Can we talk please?

41:16.161 --> 41:17.295
If you're not gonna
order anything,

41:17.363 --> 41:18.296
I'm kind of busy.

41:18.364 --> 41:19.364
Ash.

41:19.431 --> 41:20.932
If it wasn't for Caleb,

41:21.000 --> 41:23.134
we never would've entered
that team roping anyway.

41:23.202 --> 41:24.936
We just got lucky,
drew a better steer.

41:25.004 --> 41:27.171
It was a fluke that we won.

41:27.239 --> 41:28.907
Okay, we talked,

41:28.975 --> 41:30.541
I heard what you have to say,

41:30.609 --> 41:31.976
now I gotta get back to work.

41:32.043 --> 41:35.445
No, wait, I want you
to take my half.

41:35.514 --> 41:37.848
You don't have to tell Caleb.

41:37.916 --> 41:39.249
This is just so ridiculous.

41:39.317 --> 41:40.818
We were all friends
before this jackpot.

41:40.886 --> 41:43.487
I wanna go back
to being that way.

41:45.556 --> 41:48.958
Okay, I'll make a deal
with you.

41:49.026 --> 41:50.593
I'll go back to being
your friend,

41:50.661 --> 41:53.295
but I'm not gonna
take your money.

41:53.363 --> 41:54.864
It's too late.

41:54.932 --> 41:58.067
Someone already bought
the place.

41:58.135 --> 41:59.769
Who?

41:59.837 --> 42:01.904
(Suv rumbles)

42:03.706 --> 42:04.740
(Hooves clop)

42:11.648 --> 42:13.214
Mrs. Stanton.

42:13.282 --> 42:14.416
If you're looking for Ashley,

42:14.483 --> 42:15.918
she's pulling a double shift
at Maggie's.

42:15.985 --> 42:19.353
Actually,
I wanted to talk to you.

42:19.421 --> 42:21.989
I trust there are
no hard feelings?

42:22.057 --> 42:23.424
About what?

42:23.491 --> 42:26.594
Well, Ashley told me
how you were dead set

42:26.662 --> 42:27.762
against me getting involved

42:27.829 --> 42:30.497
and I respect that decision.

42:30.566 --> 42:33.300
But, Caleb, I'm her mother,

42:33.368 --> 42:34.534
and what is so wrong

42:34.602 --> 42:35.902
with wanting to help
your children

42:35.970 --> 42:36.870
when they're starting out,
right?

42:36.938 --> 42:38.204
If this is about rent,

42:38.272 --> 42:39.606
I already spoke
with the landlord.

42:39.674 --> 42:40.807
He knows we're good for it.

42:40.875 --> 42:43.810
Well, (Laughs)
See, there's the thing.

42:43.878 --> 42:46.245
I'm your landlord now.

42:46.313 --> 42:47.981
You bought our place?

42:48.049 --> 42:49.248
Not just your place;

42:49.316 --> 42:51.249
the whole kit and kaboodle!

42:51.317 --> 42:52.952
But don't worry.

42:53.019 --> 42:54.386
Not everyone who buys property

42:54.454 --> 42:56.088
evicts their tenants,

42:56.155 --> 42:58.958
(laughs) Especially
if you're in the family!

42:59.025 --> 43:00.092

Oh?

I don't even think
you can cheer me up.

43:25.516 --> 43:28.384
Tim has backed out of the deal.

43:28.452 --> 43:31.421
Well, that's too bad.
Did he give you a reason?

43:31.489 --> 43:34.324
Says he doesn't wanna sell
to me or to Dan.

43:34.391 --> 43:36.459
He's decided now he's gonna
keep the damn horse!

43:36.527 --> 43:39.095
Oh well, maybe that's best

44:11.293 --> 44:16.430
