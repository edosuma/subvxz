WEBVTT

00:04.105 --> 00:06.772
It's about time
you got back with the food.

00:07.875 --> 00:10.275
ALF, we've only been
gone an hour.

00:10.277 --> 00:11.577
An hour and twelve minutes

00:11.579 --> 00:13.779
according to
seven of my stomachs.

00:17.585 --> 00:21.987
ALF. ALF. Can't you
wait for us to unpack them?

00:21.989 --> 00:23.222
Let's see..

00:24.892 --> 00:26.658
...no!

00:27.862 --> 00:31.296
Hey, did you
get the stuff on my list?

00:31.298 --> 00:33.432
Sorry, ALF,
grocery stores on Earth

00:33.434 --> 00:36.869
still don't carry
Melmacian junk food.

00:36.871 --> 00:38.670
What about pudding in a shoe?

00:40.408 --> 00:42.808
Not available west of Jupiter.

00:44.045 --> 00:47.079
Well, it's always better
homemade anyway.

00:47.081 --> 00:50.349
Willie, can I borrow
a pair of your wingtips?

00:50.351 --> 00:53.786
You may not cook
in my shoes.

00:53.788 --> 00:55.721
Socks?

00:55.723 --> 00:59.258
Let the edict
include all footwear.

00:59.260 --> 01:02.461
Fine. Eat your bland desserts.

01:02.463 --> 01:05.097
Oh! Here, ALF.

01:05.099 --> 01:07.166
We did buy you this.

01:07.168 --> 01:10.602
My "National Inquisitor!" Great!

01:10.604 --> 01:13.072
At least I can read
about Michael Jackson's

01:13.074 --> 01:15.507
skull reduction.

01:15.509 --> 01:18.710
I<i> can't</i> believe
you<i> actually</i> read that stuff.

01:20.014 --> 01:24.016
Well, pardon me,
Mr. US-News-And-World-Report.

01:29.090 --> 01:32.257
Our alien is hooked
on gossip magazines.

01:32.259 --> 01:34.193
That sounds like
a headline<i> from</i> one of them.

01:34.195 --> 01:38.130
[chuckles]
Well, be thankful
that he likes that magazine.

01:38.132 --> 01:42.201
That actually keeps him quiet
for 30 minutes at a time.

01:42.203 --> 01:43.402
[ALF screams]

01:43.404 --> 01:44.536
[thud]

01:44.538 --> 01:46.738
Thirty seconds...at a time.

01:51.712 --> 01:52.978
He's, he's fainted.

01:54.715 --> 01:57.916
[theme music]

02:16.837 --> 02:20.038
[music continues]

02:35.289 --> 02:38.290
[music continues]

02:56.210 --> 02:58.777
[instrumental music]

03:02.550 --> 03:05.484
- What happened?
- ALF fainted.

03:05.486 --> 03:06.985
Oh.

03:06.987 --> 03:08.287
Please.

03:08.289 --> 03:10.289
No more portly women.

03:13.928 --> 03:15.727
What happened, ALF?

03:15.729 --> 03:17.462
I can't believe it, Willie.

03:17.464 --> 03:20.098
Read the headline on page two.

03:22.136 --> 03:25.270
"Corn chip dead ringer
for Liberace."

03:27.975 --> 03:29.541
Wow!

03:29.543 --> 03:33.312
Not that.
The headline next to it.

03:33.314 --> 03:37.216
"Couple in Barstow
living with space alien."

03:37.218 --> 03:38.584
That's it!

03:38.586 --> 03:41.220
Oh, ALF, don't be ridiculous.

03:41.222 --> 03:43.755
ALF, there's, there's
an article like, like this one

03:43.757 --> 03:46.592
in every issue of this magazine.

03:46.594 --> 03:49.094
But this one is different.
Read on!

03:50.331 --> 03:53.932
"The alien is described
as being short and furry

03:53.934 --> 03:57.569
with large ears
and a long snout."

03:57.571 --> 04:00.239
That sounds like ALF.

04:00.241 --> 04:02.441
Keep reading.

04:02.443 --> 04:06.478
"The creature is said
to be fond of cats

04:06.480 --> 04:10.115
and subsists on a diet of
frozen yogurt and light bulbs."

04:11.285 --> 04:14.419
That's my cousin Blinky.

04:14.421 --> 04:16.955
You have a Cousin Blinky?

04:16.957 --> 04:19.891
We call him that because
he likes to eat light bulbs.

04:20.694 --> 04:22.461
ALF, your Cousin Blinky

04:22.463 --> 04:25.731
is not living in Barstow.

04:25.733 --> 04:27.266
How could you say that?

04:27.268 --> 04:31.470
It's printed right there next to
Raymond Burr's makeup tips.

04:33.774 --> 04:36.008
Let's try to get a grip
on reality here.

04:36.010 --> 04:39.878
Just consider for a moment
the tremendous improbability

04:39.880 --> 04:42.414
of an alien from outer space

04:42.416 --> 04:45.150
actually living with a family..

04:49.490 --> 04:51.923
I'll start the car.

04:51.925 --> 04:54.826
Hold it! Hold it!

04:54.828 --> 04:56.495
Give me the paper.

04:56.497 --> 04:57.863
I'm gonna call these people

04:57.865 --> 05:00.299
and I'm gonna
settle this thing right now.

05:01.902 --> 05:05.637
Hello, I'm trying
to reach the Susla residence.

05:05.639 --> 05:08.206
I'm so excited, I could squirt.

05:09.376 --> 05:10.976
What?

05:10.978 --> 05:13.512
It's just an expression.

05:13.514 --> 05:14.980
Are you by any chance the couple

05:14.982 --> 05:17.215
that was in
the "National Inquisitor?"

05:17.217 --> 05:21.119
Oh, cut the chit-chat,
let me talk to them.

05:21.121 --> 05:23.522
You don't really have
a creature from outer space

05:23.524 --> 05:25.857
living with you, do you?

05:27.027 --> 05:29.294
And it eats light bulbs?

05:30.864 --> 05:33.098
Nothing over 75 watts.

05:34.301 --> 05:35.701
I see.

05:35.703 --> 05:37.102
Hand me the phone.

05:37.104 --> 05:40.005
Would your space alien
happen to be

05:40.007 --> 05:42.207
um, little on the pushy side?

05:45.579 --> 05:47.045
Oh, really?

05:47.047 --> 05:48.814
Well, thank you then.
Thank you.

05:48.816 --> 05:50.849
Thank you very much.
Thank you for your time.

05:52.686 --> 05:54.419
Barstow.

05:54.421 --> 05:56.288
No-o-o.

05:56.290 --> 05:57.322
Ye-e-eah.

05:58.859 --> 06:02.894
ALF. Barstow is a three-hour
drive from here.

06:02.896 --> 06:05.864
- But we're cousins.
- ALF, you don't really--

06:05.866 --> 06:08.567
¶ Melmacian cousins
all the way ¶

06:08.569 --> 06:09.968
Believe me, there is a--

06:09.970 --> 06:12.371
¶ One pair
of matching bookends ¶

06:12.373 --> 06:13.605
I'll get my keys.

06:13.607 --> 06:16.007
¶ Barstow we're on our way ¶¶

06:17.845 --> 06:20.812
[instrumental music]

06:23.917 --> 06:26.118
Willie, do I look alright?

06:26.120 --> 06:28.420
You look fine, ALF.

06:28.422 --> 06:29.955
You look just as fine

06:29.957 --> 06:32.891
as the last 29 times
you asked me.

06:33.627 --> 06:37.062
I wanna look my best.

06:37.064 --> 06:40.332
I'm really unhappy with this
new cream rinse I've been using.

06:42.336 --> 06:45.871
I realize how important
this is to you, ALF..

06:45.873 --> 06:47.105
...but I-I don't..

06:47.107 --> 06:48.306
[coughs]

06:48.308 --> 06:49.674
I don't want you
to be disappoint..

06:49.676 --> 06:52.377
[coughing]

06:52.379 --> 06:53.912
What is that?

06:54.848 --> 06:56.681
Antiperspirant.

06:56.683 --> 06:59.351
I sweat when I'm nervous.

06:59.353 --> 07:02.287
Put it away.
It smells terrible.

07:03.290 --> 07:04.790
Fine.

07:04.792 --> 07:07.626
I'll slap on
some of this cologne instead.

07:07.628 --> 07:09.461
[scoffs]

07:09.463 --> 07:10.729
[coughs]

07:10.731 --> 07:12.931
Here, Willie. Smell this.

07:14.668 --> 07:15.700
Oh.

07:15.702 --> 07:17.536
[sniffs]
Yeah.

07:17.538 --> 07:19.838
[sniffs]
What's this?

07:19.840 --> 07:21.706
Asbestos.

07:21.708 --> 07:23.508
[coughs]

07:30.284 --> 07:31.883
Too musky?

07:35.823 --> 07:37.823
[blows a raspberry]

07:37.825 --> 07:39.724
As I was saying..

07:39.726 --> 07:43.061
...I realized
how important this is to you.

07:43.063 --> 07:44.329
That's why I'm driving
all the way

07:44.331 --> 07:45.831
to Barstow, you know, but I--

07:45.833 --> 07:47.933
Willie, I know
what you're gonna say.

07:47.935 --> 07:50.068
- You do?
- Sure.

07:50.070 --> 07:52.070
And I appreciate the offer.

07:52.072 --> 07:54.139
And I know
that Blinky is gonna

07:54.141 --> 07:57.509
fit into the Tanner household
as well as I do.

07:58.479 --> 08:01.480
[instrumental music]

08:04.852 --> 08:07.586
Well, this must be it.

08:08.922 --> 08:10.722
- Well, see you later.
- Oh, no, wait!

08:10.724 --> 08:12.757
Wait, ALF!

08:12.759 --> 08:14.059
Remember our plan.

08:14.061 --> 08:16.928
I go in
and check this out first.

08:16.930 --> 08:19.531
That's<i> your</i> plan.

08:19.533 --> 08:23.568
We can't take any chances.
Let<i> caution</i> be our credo.

08:25.172 --> 08:27.839
"Let caution be our credo?"

08:27.841 --> 08:29.374
Stay in the car.

08:29.376 --> 08:31.243
And stay down.

08:33.380 --> 08:35.113
[car door shuts]

08:36.216 --> 08:38.416
I just know I'm gonna squirt.

08:40.387 --> 08:43.355
[spray hissing]

08:45.626 --> 08:47.292
[doorbell rings]

08:50.964 --> 08:53.164
- Hello.
- Hello.

08:53.166 --> 08:55.000
My name is William Tanner.

08:55.002 --> 08:56.301
I called earlier today

08:56.303 --> 08:58.603
regarding your claim
to have an alien.

08:58.605 --> 09:01.039
Right this way.

09:03.844 --> 09:05.377
[door creaks]

09:07.281 --> 09:09.247
Please excuse the house.

09:09.249 --> 09:11.750
It's a bit cluttered
since the tent fire.

09:12.786 --> 09:14.052
Tent fire?

09:14.054 --> 09:16.821
We had a traveling museum
of sorts.

09:16.823 --> 09:18.690
Our lives are devoted

09:18.692 --> 09:20.959
to accessing the unknown

09:20.961 --> 09:22.627
harvesting the bizarre

09:22.629 --> 09:26.598
and exploiting the hideous
atrocities of nature.

09:27.401 --> 09:29.067
How nice.

09:29.069 --> 09:31.269
It's a living.

09:32.506 --> 09:35.740
Uh, that's Billy the Kid's
mummified mustache.

09:35.742 --> 09:39.444
Oh, what's that dried up
pink thing underneath it?

09:39.446 --> 09:41.580
Billy's lips.

09:43.517 --> 09:46.918
- About this alien..
- Oh, no. Not another one.

09:46.920 --> 09:50.455
Uh, this is my husband Nick.

09:50.457 --> 09:52.991
Goodbye, Nick.

09:52.993 --> 09:54.993
Uh, pleased to meet you,
Mr. Susla.

09:54.995 --> 09:56.361
Uh, I'm Willie Tanner.

09:56.363 --> 09:58.763
The name is pronounced<i> Soosla.</i>

09:58.765 --> 10:00.632
No, no, you, you were right.

10:00.634 --> 10:02.367
It is Susla.

10:02.369 --> 10:05.103
I should know
how to pronounce my own name.

10:05.105 --> 10:07.238
I think you should by now.

10:07.240 --> 10:09.975
Don't start with me, Betty.

10:09.977 --> 10:11.977
Look, you're wasting your time.

10:11.979 --> 10:13.812
There is no alien here.

10:13.814 --> 10:15.246
What Nick is saying is

10:15.248 --> 10:18.416
that the alien's not here
right now.

10:18.418 --> 10:20.151
That's not what I'm saying.

10:20.153 --> 10:22.621
I'm saying
there is no alien here.

10:22.623 --> 10:24.289
Right now.

10:26.426 --> 10:29.361
Are you saying
that you don't have an alien?

10:29.363 --> 10:32.097
- Yes. We do.
- No. We don't.

10:32.099 --> 10:34.165
I can prove
we have an alien.

10:34.167 --> 10:36.635
Uh, I have a photograph.

10:37.671 --> 10:40.905
- Would you like to see it?
- Yes.

10:40.907 --> 10:42.707
- How much?
- Very much.

10:42.709 --> 10:45.610
No, no, I meant in dollars.

10:45.612 --> 10:47.479
Well, I don't wanna buy it.
I just wanna see it.

10:47.481 --> 10:50.015
And how much
is that worth to you?

10:50.017 --> 10:52.317
Save your money.

10:55.555 --> 10:57.756
- I think I'd better be going.
- Oh, wait.

10:57.758 --> 10:59.491
Uh, for ten bucks

10:59.493 --> 11:01.760
I'll let you have
a glimpse of it.

11:09.970 --> 11:11.770
Okay. Fine.

11:12.773 --> 11:14.639
Don't stare. Glimpse.

11:20.447 --> 11:22.380
You know, it looked..

11:22.382 --> 11:25.483
...amazingly like
a German shepherd

11:25.485 --> 11:28.420
with some kind of antenna
stuck on his head.

11:29.523 --> 11:32.290
Real amazingly.

11:32.292 --> 11:35.994
What kind of person
would put antennas on a dog?

11:35.996 --> 11:39.197
The same kind of person
who would glue a horn on a goat.

11:40.267 --> 11:43.068
It's not a goat. It's a unicorn.

11:43.070 --> 11:45.470
Its horn was loose.

11:47.974 --> 11:49.307
Thank you.

11:49.309 --> 11:51.376
Uh, thank you for your time.

11:51.378 --> 11:54.479
And thank you
for sharing that with me.

11:54.481 --> 11:57.215
It was certainly
worth the ten dollars.

11:57.217 --> 11:59.284
Wait, uh, for another ten

11:59.286 --> 12:01.453
I'll let you see a picture
of his spaceship.

12:02.522 --> 12:05.457
- Maybe another time.
- Oh, too bad.

12:05.459 --> 12:08.393
It looks a lot like a hubcap
with lights glued to it.

12:09.496 --> 12:11.563
I'm warning you, Nick.

12:13.066 --> 12:14.399
Goodbye.

12:15.235 --> 12:16.301
[goat bleats]

12:16.303 --> 12:17.802
'Oh, pardon me.'

12:17.804 --> 12:19.270
'Coming through.'

12:19.272 --> 12:21.539
[goat bleats]

12:21.541 --> 12:24.309
- Can I say just one thing?
- What?

12:24.311 --> 12:26.144
I can't live like this anymore.

12:26.146 --> 12:27.712
Oh, what are you talking about?

12:27.714 --> 12:31.483
I just got a quick ten bucks
out of that sucker.

12:31.485 --> 12:33.918
Fine, we'll apply it
to this month's glue bill.

12:37.023 --> 12:39.257
Oh, ALF. ALF?

12:39.259 --> 12:40.558
[doorbell rings]

12:40.560 --> 12:41.793
[gasps]

12:44.164 --> 12:45.764

12:49.970 --> 12:52.437
[instrumental music]

12:53.607 --> 12:56.975
In all my years
with traveling freak shows

12:56.977 --> 12:59.844
I've<i> never</i> seen
<i> anything</i> like you.

13:01.181 --> 13:02.647
Likewise.

13:04.151 --> 13:06.551
Except for Jojo, the Beast Boy.

13:07.988 --> 13:09.254
Betty.

13:09.256 --> 13:11.356
This thing ain't
nothing like Jojo.

13:11.358 --> 13:13.224
This thing ain't human.

13:13.226 --> 13:15.326
Thank you.

13:15.328 --> 13:17.562
No, thank<i> you.</i>

13:17.564 --> 13:19.531
You're exactly what we need

13:19.533 --> 13:21.766
to take this show
on the road again.

13:23.069 --> 13:25.170
Show? What show?

13:25.172 --> 13:27.872
Betty, your
sideshow days are over.

13:27.874 --> 13:30.275
I don't want you
growing the beard again.

13:30.277 --> 13:32.610
[clicks tongue]
I won't have to.

13:32.612 --> 13:36.548
We have our star attraction
right here.

13:36.550 --> 13:39.117
I'm, I'm getting
another one of my headaches.

13:39.119 --> 13:41.486
Then go take
another one of your naps.

13:44.357 --> 13:46.257
Look, I appreciate the offer

13:46.259 --> 13:48.860
but I'm really here
to see Blinky.

13:48.862 --> 13:50.161
Uh, Blinky?

13:50.163 --> 13:51.763
Uh, what's Blinky?

13:51.765 --> 13:54.132
I know you've got him.
Where is he?

13:54.134 --> 13:55.500
Get me Blinky.

13:55.502 --> 13:57.769
Oh, we'll get you a blinky.

13:57.771 --> 14:01.673
We'll get you
all the blinky you want.

14:01.675 --> 14:04.709
You're going to be
very happy with us.

14:05.278 --> 14:06.945
[doorbell rings]

14:07.948 --> 14:09.948
I'll get rid of whoever that is.

14:11.985 --> 14:13.384
[panting]

14:13.386 --> 14:15.153
Oh, excuse me
for bothering you--

14:15.155 --> 14:17.255
- Go away.
- I, I will. I promise.

14:17.257 --> 14:19.023
I just wanted
to retrieve something--

14:19.025 --> 14:20.458
No refunds.

14:20.460 --> 14:22.293
I-I'm not asking for a refund.

14:22.295 --> 14:23.995
I just wanted some..
May I please come in?

14:23.997 --> 14:25.897
I said, "Beat it!"

14:25.899 --> 14:27.765
We're closed!

14:27.767 --> 14:30.635
'Catch us in the spring.
We'll be on the road again.'

14:31.838 --> 14:34.405
[doorbell ringing]

14:34.407 --> 14:36.774
I'm really sorry, but..

14:37.878 --> 14:39.677
Oh, my.

14:41.481 --> 14:43.882
I don't wanna use this.

14:45.051 --> 14:47.352
Go with that impulse.

14:52.158 --> 14:53.992
[door creaks]

14:57.464 --> 14:59.230
Was that, Willie?

14:59.232 --> 15:02.333
Oh, no, no. It wasn't anybody.

15:02.335 --> 15:05.103
Uh, why don't you
just take a seat?

15:13.380 --> 15:16.447
[instrumental music]

15:17.651 --> 15:19.851
[telephone ringing]

15:21.922 --> 15:23.054
Hello?

15:23.056 --> 15:24.389
Kate, it's me.

15:24.391 --> 15:25.890
Oh, Willie,
we were just beginning to worry.

15:25.892 --> 15:28.660
- Is everything alright?
- 'Not exactly.'

15:28.662 --> 15:30.929
Well, what do you mean?

15:30.931 --> 15:33.131
Do they have an alien?

15:33.133 --> 15:35.500
They do now.

15:35.502 --> 15:37.135
- What's going on?
- They have ALF.

15:37.137 --> 15:38.670
And they won't let him go?

15:38.672 --> 15:40.104
I'm gonna go back
and try to get him out

15:40.106 --> 15:42.440
but it, it may take a while.

15:42.442 --> 15:44.175
'Uh, will you call me back?'

15:44.177 --> 15:48.279
I can't, Kate. I spent all my
money glimpsing a Polaroid.

15:48.281 --> 15:49.914
Glimpsing a Polaroid?

15:49.916 --> 15:52.283
- A Polaroid of what?
- Of what?

15:52.285 --> 15:54.652
German shepherd...with antennas.

15:55.689 --> 15:57.989
- Antennas?
- It has antennas?

15:59.559 --> 16:01.292
It just goes downhill
from there, Kate.

16:01.294 --> 16:03.828
I-I'll call you later.
I love you.

16:04.931 --> 16:06.397
Honey, I love you.

16:06.399 --> 16:08.967
What has antennas?

16:08.969 --> 16:11.536
Apparently, German shepherds
in Barstow.

16:13.273 --> 16:16.474
[instrumental music]

16:17.043 --> 16:19.410
[grunting]

16:20.547 --> 16:22.914
It's no wonder
Blinky didn't stick around

16:22.916 --> 16:26.284
if you treat
all your houseguests like this.

16:26.286 --> 16:32.590
How about we bill you
as "Bobo, the Amazing Aardvark.

16:32.592 --> 16:34.625
Hear him talk"?

16:34.627 --> 16:36.661
Betty, come to bed.

16:36.663 --> 16:38.496
Yeah, yeah, in a minute.

16:38.498 --> 16:42.433
Oh, you're gonna make us
a lot of money.

16:42.435 --> 16:45.970
How about
Dodo, the Hairy Parrot?

16:47.407 --> 16:49.640
How about telling me
why I'm tied up?

16:49.642 --> 16:52.377
So she can glue antennas on you.

16:52.379 --> 16:56.814
Shh! Not in front
of the F-R-E-A-K.

16:58.151 --> 17:00.585
Who's Frank?

17:00.587 --> 17:02.887
I'm going to bed.
You coming or not?

17:02.889 --> 17:04.689
Yeah, yeah.

17:04.691 --> 17:08.226
Goodnight, my furry
little gold mine.

17:09.596 --> 17:11.696
Night, Frank.

17:16.669 --> 17:18.302
[door closes]

17:18.304 --> 17:20.838
[grunting]

17:22.075 --> 17:23.207
[thud]

17:25.078 --> 17:26.778
[thud]

17:26.780 --> 17:29.347
(Betty)
'Hey, what's going on
in there?'

17:29.349 --> 17:31.082
Nothing.

17:32.118 --> 17:33.151
[thud]

17:33.153 --> 17:34.218
[glass shatters]

17:34.220 --> 17:36.888
Uh, that was nothing also.

17:39.426 --> 17:41.359
[screams]

17:41.361 --> 17:43.628
- It's me.
- Willie!

17:43.630 --> 17:45.863
(Betty)
'Keep it quiet in there.'

17:45.865 --> 17:49.567
Sorry. Just a painful rope burn.

17:53.006 --> 17:55.473
- You alright, ALF?
- I'm fine.

17:55.475 --> 17:57.708
But I don't know
what they've done to Blinky.

17:57.710 --> 18:00.945
Blinky. I'll show you.

18:01.448 --> 18:02.814
Here.

18:03.483 --> 18:06.651
This is their alien.

18:06.653 --> 18:09.153
Looks like a German shepherd
with antlers.

18:10.623 --> 18:13.257
Oh, we'll be out of here
in no time.

18:16.196 --> 18:17.662
Or not.

18:17.664 --> 18:19.997
Oh-oh. It's Frank's husband.

18:20.834 --> 18:22.433
Hold it right there.

18:22.435 --> 18:23.668
Freeze!

18:23.670 --> 18:25.169
Don't move!

18:26.439 --> 18:29.540
No, you hold it right there.
Freeze. Don't move.

18:29.542 --> 18:31.709
Do you know what this is?

18:31.711 --> 18:34.412
It's either a talking aardvark
or a hairy parrot.

18:34.414 --> 18:37.148
Betty hasn't decided yet.

18:37.150 --> 18:40.585
This is a creature possessed
of unimaginable powers.

18:41.588 --> 18:43.821
Powers?

18:43.823 --> 18:45.823
Yes, powers.
You know, your powers.

18:45.825 --> 18:48.059
Your unimaginable powers.

18:49.462 --> 18:51.829
The powers we all find so..

18:52.632 --> 18:54.899
...unimaginable.

18:54.901 --> 18:57.468
The powers you don't like to use
unless we're in trouble

18:57.470 --> 19:00.004
and there's<i> no way out.</i>

19:00.640 --> 19:03.641
Oh, those powers.

19:06.112 --> 19:08.779
You know, I don't like
to use those powers, Willie.

19:11.317 --> 19:13.017
I feel you must.

19:13.686 --> 19:16.020
Well...alright.

19:19.159 --> 19:22.860
Oo-o-oh!

19:24.564 --> 19:26.564
You'd better get out of here

19:26.566 --> 19:28.166
because in..

19:28.168 --> 19:30.301
...in just about ten seconds,
you'll be--

19:30.303 --> 19:32.937
- Ooh!
- Yes.

19:34.240 --> 19:36.274
You'll be flatter
than a flapjack.

19:36.276 --> 19:38.643
(ALF)
'Ooh!'

19:38.645 --> 19:41.179
[grunting]

19:42.048 --> 19:43.080
Yes.

19:44.517 --> 19:45.750
- Ten.
- Ooh!

19:45.752 --> 19:47.652
- Nine. Eight.
- Ah!

19:47.654 --> 19:49.053
- Seven.
- Ah!

19:49.055 --> 19:50.188
(Willie)
'Six.'

19:50.190 --> 19:51.856
[shrieking]

19:51.858 --> 19:55.426
Five. Four. Three.

19:55.428 --> 19:58.029
- Two. One!
- Yeah!

19:58.031 --> 20:00.665
Two! Three.

20:02.235 --> 20:04.635
Oh, forget it.
It's not working.

20:06.072 --> 20:08.272
What are you gonna do with us?

20:09.442 --> 20:12.210
Go on, get out of here.

20:12.212 --> 20:13.744
You mean, you're gonna
let us go?

20:13.746 --> 20:15.913
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Go on.

20:15.915 --> 20:17.415
Well, that's
awfully nice of you.

20:17.417 --> 20:18.916
What nice?

20:18.918 --> 20:20.585
I just don't wanna go
back out on the road

20:20.587 --> 20:23.154
with another
rolling geek brigade.

20:23.156 --> 20:27.158
I just want a nice, quiet
retirement with my lunatic wife.

20:28.695 --> 20:30.561
I really appreciate this.

20:30.563 --> 20:32.563
Yeah, likewise.

20:32.565 --> 20:35.233
(Betty)
'Nick? What's going on
out there?'

20:36.035 --> 20:38.669
Hey! How did he get in here?

20:38.671 --> 20:42.106
What's he doing
with my parrot?

20:42.108 --> 20:45.643
Stay back, honey. That thing's
got unimaginable powers.

20:45.645 --> 20:47.645
If we don't let him go,
he's gonna squash me

20:47.647 --> 20:50.281
like a two-headed elephant
on a peanut.

20:50.283 --> 20:53.184
Since when does
a parrot have powers?

20:55.121 --> 20:56.220
ALF!

20:56.222 --> 20:58.956
Whoo-o-o!

20:58.958 --> 21:01.192
Not that! Let's go!

21:03.329 --> 21:05.396
Hey! Glue an antennae on this!

ALF.

21:22.949 --> 21:24.815
Yeah?

21:24.817 --> 21:27.618
I'm sorry it didn't work out.

21:27.620 --> 21:29.020
Me too.

21:30.623 --> 21:32.823
Well, I'm glad you're safe.

21:33.960 --> 21:37.962
Safe and alone...species-wise.

21:39.799 --> 21:43.234
You know, we all feel alone
at certain times in our lives.

21:44.103 --> 21:47.638
Feeling alone and being alone

21:47.640 --> 21:49.840
are two different things.

21:51.644 --> 21:53.344
I'm sorry.

21:53.346 --> 21:55.813
ALF, I wish there was
something I could say.

21:57.150 --> 21:59.650
I actually believed it, Willie.

21:59.652 --> 22:01.686
I really convinced myself

22:01.688 --> 22:04.522
there might be
others of my kind here.

22:04.524 --> 22:07.258
Well, who knows, pal.
Someday there might be.

Follow that car! Hurry!

22:26.979 --> 22:29.547
- What car?
- The one that just passed us.

22:29.549 --> 22:31.315
Catch up to it.

22:31.317 --> 22:35.319
ALF, there hasn't been a car
on this road for miles.

22:35.321 --> 22:36.687
I just saw one!

22:36.689 --> 22:38.889
And Blinky was in it!

22:39.959 --> 22:43.094
You must have been
daydreaming, pal.

22:43.096 --> 22:46.163
- I was?
- I mean, think about it.

22:46.165 --> 22:47.832
What are the odds
that a creature

22:47.834 --> 22:49.967
from outer space
would be in a car

22:49.969 --> 22:53.371
on this road at this time of..

22:53.373 --> 22:56.874
I mean, what are the odds
that two creatures

22:56.876 --> 22:59.777
from outer space
would be in two cars

22:59.779 --> 23:01.979
on this road at..

23:04.317 --> 23:06.784
I think maybe you better
drive for a while.
