WEBVTT

00:02.335 --> 00:04.086
NOAH:
<i>I did not rape her!</i>

00:04.170 --> 00:05.755
{\an3}But you and Valerie
did have sex.

00:05.839 --> 00:07.215
I told you that.

00:07.298 --> 00:09.634
{\an1}She didn't say no or try
to resist in any way?

00:09.718 --> 00:12.137
{\an3}I told you
I did not rape her!

00:12.220 --> 00:13.847
You were drunk that night.

00:13.930 --> 00:16.433
Believe me, she was
as much into it as I was.

00:16.516 --> 00:18.059
That's not what she said.
She's lying.

00:18.143 --> 00:20.311
Is she lying about the
Rohypnol found in her blood?

00:20.395 --> 00:21.563
I don't know.

00:21.646 --> 00:22.939
The club was full of guys.

00:23.022 --> 00:23.982
It could've been anyone.

00:24.065 --> 00:26.401
{\an3}Yeah? But she had
sex with you.

00:28.361 --> 00:31.239
He's not denying
we had sex, is he?

00:31.322 --> 00:33.241
{\an1}He's saying
it was consensual.

00:33.324 --> 00:34.451
Pig.

00:34.534 --> 00:36.244
Do you have a sexual
history with him?

00:36.327 --> 00:37.579
What has that got
to do with anything?

00:37.662 --> 00:39.831
Valentine's Day,
old time's sake.

00:39.914 --> 00:41.666
What, and a roofie cocktail
to break the ice?

00:41.750 --> 00:42.917
I don't think so.

00:43.001 --> 00:44.169
Did he break up with you?

00:44.252 --> 00:45.253
Yeah, then he raped me.

00:45.336 --> 00:46.254
Go figure.

00:46.337 --> 00:47.422
If he raped you...

00:47.505 --> 00:48.631
Which he did.

00:48.715 --> 00:50.467
I want him prosecuted.

00:50.550 --> 00:52.135
And I'm sorry.

00:52.218 --> 00:54.179
But to do that, I need to know
that you didn't want it.

00:54.262 --> 00:55.138
Don't you get it?

00:55.221 --> 00:58.016
He took away my ability
to know what I wanted.

00:58.099 --> 01:00.185
I shouldn't be the
one on trial here.

01:00.268 --> 01:02.479
No, you shouldn't.

01:02.562 --> 01:05.565
But with date rape,
the victims usually are.

01:08.359 --> 01:10.487
What is taking so long?

01:10.570 --> 01:13.364
{\an1}It's rape, Donna,
it's a serious crime.

01:13.448 --> 01:14.157
David, he didn't rape her.

01:14.240 --> 01:15.658
He didn't even
sleep with her.

01:15.742 --> 01:17.660
{\an1}Yeah, they spent the night
together last night.

01:17.744 --> 01:20.413
{\an1}All right?
Open your eyes.

01:20.497 --> 01:22.499
I can't deal with this.

01:23.416 --> 01:25.960
Hey, are those pain
killers not working?

01:26.044 --> 01:27.754
Well, my back feels okay,

01:27.837 --> 01:30.507
but the pills sure
are wiping me out.

01:30.590 --> 01:33.176
I'm trying to hold off.

01:33.259 --> 01:37.013
Listen, I tore up my knee
skiing recently, you know?

01:37.096 --> 01:40.433
The pain was so bad, I just
started downing the pills.

01:40.517 --> 01:42.519
{\an3}I never knew being a zombie
could feel so good.

01:42.602 --> 01:43.520
I want the pain to go away,

01:43.603 --> 01:45.730
{\an1}but I want to be able
to function, too, you know?

01:45.814 --> 01:47.857
Yeah, that's why you
need one set of pills

01:47.941 --> 01:50.193
to counteract the other.
Is that what you did?

01:50.276 --> 01:53.822
Couple of D amphetamines,
and, uh, you'll be fine.

01:53.905 --> 01:55.365
When all this nonsense is over,

01:55.448 --> 01:57.450
I'll set you up, okay?

01:59.118 --> 02:01.830
{\an1}I just can't believe
what she's accusing him of.

02:01.913 --> 02:03.373
(sighs)

02:05.416 --> 02:07.669
Hey, you all right?

02:07.752 --> 02:09.253
Yeah. I just...

02:09.336 --> 02:10.713
I just want to go home.

02:10.797 --> 02:11.881
Um, what about Noah?

02:11.965 --> 02:13.341
{\an3}They're gonna
charge him, right?

02:13.424 --> 02:15.385
{\an1}No, not till tomorrow
after they talk to the D.A.

02:15.468 --> 02:17.595
I did not rape you!

02:17.679 --> 02:20.390
{\an3}Whoa, hey, hey, hey.
Hey, shut up, all right?!

02:20.473 --> 02:22.433
{\an3}Don't talk to her,
don't even look at her.

02:23.810 --> 02:27.397
How can you stand by him?

02:27.480 --> 02:28.731
Forget about them, okay?

02:28.815 --> 02:29.899
How'd it go in there?

02:29.983 --> 02:32.026
{\an1}I don't know,
it's her word against mine.

02:32.110 --> 02:34.529
{\an3}Look, we know you didn't
do anything, okay?

02:36.447 --> 02:37.615
Just give us a minute?

02:37.699 --> 02:39.742
Yeah, no problem.

02:42.495 --> 02:44.414
{\an3}I shouldn't drink
when I'm angry.

02:44.497 --> 02:45.748
Bad things happen.

02:45.832 --> 02:47.417
Don't blame yourself.

02:47.500 --> 02:49.711
You did nothing wrong here.

02:49.794 --> 02:52.380
Listen to me.

02:52.463 --> 02:55.049
Valerie and I,

02:55.133 --> 02:56.509
we did have sex.

02:58.845 --> 03:00.179
What?

03:00.263 --> 03:02.432
Look, I was drunk and jealous
about you and David.

03:02.515 --> 03:05.476
This isn't happening.

03:05.560 --> 03:07.979
I did not rape her.

03:08.062 --> 03:11.274
Tell me this isn't happening.

03:11.357 --> 03:14.068
I'm sorry.

05:18.818 --> 05:21.279
the record company really
wants to get this CD out,

05:21.362 --> 05:23.781
but I mean, why do we
have to record at night?

05:23.865 --> 05:25.074
You never said anything
about this.

05:25.158 --> 05:27.744
Off-hour rates
are all we can afford.

05:27.827 --> 05:29.704
The old lady impose
a curfew or something?

05:29.787 --> 05:30.913
No, she, uh,

05:30.997 --> 05:32.582
she was assaulted.

05:32.665 --> 05:34.459
Is she okay?

05:34.542 --> 05:38.254
{\an1}No, that's why I really
can't record tonight.

05:38.337 --> 05:40.256
Hey, no problem.

05:40.339 --> 05:42.925
We can postpone putting down
keyboard tracks for a while.

05:43.009 --> 05:44.385
Great, thanks.

05:47.388 --> 05:50.266
David, this album is
your big opportunity.

05:50.349 --> 05:52.351
It can wait.

05:52.435 --> 05:55.271
{\an3}You know, if the
situation was reversed,

05:55.354 --> 05:57.940
I don't know if I'd
do the same for you.

05:58.024 --> 05:59.400
{\an3}Thanks.

06:04.530 --> 06:07.450
Why would she lie
about being raped?

06:07.533 --> 06:10.453
For the same reason she lied
about being pregnant last year.

06:10.536 --> 06:12.413
{\an3}But she's not asking
Noah for money.

06:12.497 --> 06:14.457
Oh, yeah? Just you wait.

06:14.540 --> 06:17.919
She lied about having
an abortion, Brandon.

06:18.002 --> 06:19.253
Noah was drunk.

06:19.337 --> 06:20.963
Maybe he just missed a signal.

06:21.047 --> 06:22.256
Could he have drugged her?

06:22.340 --> 06:24.092
I don't know.

06:24.175 --> 06:26.177
The only thing we know
is that one of them is lying.

06:27.345 --> 06:28.971
And who would that be?

06:30.056 --> 06:31.599
{\an1}STEVE:
We were just

06:31.682 --> 06:33.476
talking, Valerie.

06:33.559 --> 06:35.311
So we heard.

06:35.394 --> 06:36.562
Are you feeling any better?

06:36.646 --> 06:37.980
Worse, actually.

06:38.064 --> 06:39.774
And until a second ago,

06:39.857 --> 06:42.026
I didn't think
that was possible.

06:50.076 --> 06:51.661
(seabirds calling)

06:54.080 --> 06:56.499
And the wife and kids are good?

06:56.582 --> 06:58.000
Good, glad to hear it.

06:58.084 --> 06:59.210
This is Arnie Greenwalt.

06:59.293 --> 07:00.461
He went to law school
with the D.A.

07:00.545 --> 07:01.546
Hang up the phone.

07:01.629 --> 07:03.506
Noah, he's got pull.

07:03.589 --> 07:05.133
Look, you hang it up or I will.

07:05.216 --> 07:07.009
Arnie, listen, I gotta go.

07:07.093 --> 07:08.511
{\an3}Yeah, I'll tell you what,
when I get home though.

07:08.594 --> 07:10.972
{\an3}we'll tear up that new course
at Gretna Hills, okay?

07:11.055 --> 07:12.557
{\an3}All right.

07:12.640 --> 07:14.308
Yeah, you, too.

07:14.392 --> 07:15.685
Moron.

07:15.768 --> 07:17.311
But with influence.

07:17.395 --> 07:20.189
A healthy campaign contribution
and you are off the hook.

07:20.273 --> 07:21.524
I said no.

07:21.607 --> 07:23.234
Noah, you don't know
what a jury is gonna do.

07:23.317 --> 07:24.402
I'll take that chance.

07:24.485 --> 07:25.820
Fine. I just don't know why

07:25.903 --> 07:27.196
you're being so stubborn
about this.

07:27.280 --> 07:29.699
{\an1}You don't know why?
Because I'm innocent.

07:29.782 --> 07:32.702
{\an3}I know you don't want the
family money bailing you out,

07:32.785 --> 07:35.371
{\an3}but I am trying
to help you here.

07:35.454 --> 07:37.248
Look, I know you are,
and I appreciate it,

07:37.331 --> 07:41.252
but this is not
the way to do it.

07:41.335 --> 07:42.336
It's just not.

07:42.420 --> 07:44.964
All right.

07:46.799 --> 07:48.426
(waves crashing)

07:49.969 --> 07:52.638
Are you telling me
to forgive him?

07:52.722 --> 07:55.516
{\an1}No, I'm just saying
that how you feel today

07:55.600 --> 07:57.059
isn't how you'll feel tomorrow

07:57.143 --> 08:00.062
or next week or even next month.

08:00.146 --> 08:02.481
{\an3}And you think you've
really forgiven Brandon?

08:02.565 --> 08:05.526
Yeah, I have.

08:07.361 --> 08:09.572
{\an6}(voice cracking):
I just can't believe
that he did this.

08:09.655 --> 08:12.408
It seems so weird,

08:12.491 --> 08:14.702
{\an1}I mean, I know
that he loves you.

08:18.164 --> 08:19.415
I know.

08:19.498 --> 08:22.293
And he was really
drunk that night,

08:22.376 --> 08:24.378
{\an3}and he was jealous
of me and David.

08:24.462 --> 08:28.424
And Valerie probably
wasn't playing hard to get.

08:28.507 --> 08:30.426
What if she was?

08:30.509 --> 08:32.803
{\an3}Donna.
What?

08:32.886 --> 08:36.307
He was drunk and he was jealous.

08:36.390 --> 08:38.433
Maybe he got out of control.

08:38.517 --> 08:40.269
I know you're mad at Noah,
but he's not a rapist.

08:40.352 --> 08:42.938
I know, I know.

08:43.022 --> 08:44.607
(sighs)

08:47.068 --> 08:48.402
What is that?

08:48.486 --> 08:49.654
I thought you were holding off.

08:49.737 --> 08:51.280
{\an3}Yeah, I was till about
4:30 this morning,

08:51.364 --> 08:55.159
{\an3}when it numbed the pain
and helped me sleep.

08:55.243 --> 08:57.995
{\an1}I hope you canceled
your presentation for today.

08:58.079 --> 08:59.247
It's tomorrow.

08:59.330 --> 09:01.749
But I did call in sick today.

09:01.832 --> 09:03.376
Want me to do the same?

09:03.459 --> 09:04.293
We could rent some movies.

09:04.377 --> 09:06.128
You don't have to.

09:06.212 --> 09:08.297
{\an3}But it sure would be nice
if you did.

09:08.381 --> 09:09.382
I'll let them know.

09:13.386 --> 09:16.305
{\an3}Could we talk?
You should've called first.

09:16.389 --> 09:17.974
I didn't want you telling me
not to come over.

09:18.057 --> 09:19.308
Yes, and now I'm telling you
to leave.

09:19.392 --> 09:21.102
Donna, let me explain.

09:21.185 --> 09:22.103
What?

09:22.186 --> 09:25.189
{\an3}You slept with her,
you can't explain that.

09:25.273 --> 09:26.649
I could go to jail for this.

09:27.733 --> 09:29.485
Noah, you did a really
terrible thing,

09:29.568 --> 09:31.320
but nobody thinks
you're a criminal.

09:31.404 --> 09:33.447
I want her to tell me that.

09:33.531 --> 09:35.741
She can't do that right now.

09:47.420 --> 09:50.423
(crying)

09:55.261 --> 09:58.306
(sobbing)

10:06.397 --> 10:09.734
{\an1}In my experience,
date rape is hard to prove.

10:09.817 --> 10:11.527
Even with Rohypnol?

10:11.610 --> 10:14.155
Without witnesses, it's
his word against hers.

10:14.238 --> 10:15.698
{\an3}Well, her word isn't
worth very much.

10:15.781 --> 10:18.868
{\an3}It's not about is he guilty,
it's about proof.

10:18.951 --> 10:22.330
{\an1}That's the basis
for our legal system.

10:22.413 --> 10:23.706
The only thing
the D.A. risks

10:23.789 --> 10:26.042
going after these bums
is their track record.

10:26.125 --> 10:27.251
We're risking our lives.

10:27.335 --> 10:29.837
{\an3}Sounds like the system
needs some work.

10:29.920 --> 10:32.173
And you need a day off.

10:32.256 --> 10:35.051
{\an1}We're working nights
all this week.

10:35.134 --> 10:36.761
Hey, Glen, buddy...
Hmm?

10:36.844 --> 10:38.888
how about flying solo one night?

10:38.971 --> 10:40.348
I don't think so.

10:40.431 --> 10:41.515
{\an3}Come on.

10:41.599 --> 10:42.892
{\an3}I got tickets to the
Hollywood Bowl.

10:42.975 --> 10:45.436
I'm moved.

10:45.519 --> 10:48.439
That was a shot.
(laughing)

10:48.522 --> 10:50.066
We'll do it some other time?

10:50.149 --> 10:52.276
Yeah, great.

10:52.360 --> 10:53.569
{\an3}So, you guys see
more action at night?

10:53.652 --> 10:55.905
You wouldn't believe.

10:55.988 --> 10:57.281
Sorry, Officer.

10:57.365 --> 10:58.407
Your money's no good here.

10:58.491 --> 10:59.408
Well, thanks.

10:59.492 --> 11:00.284
Thank Brandon,

11:00.368 --> 11:01.744
I put it on his tab.

11:01.827 --> 11:03.371
{\an3}(chuckling)

11:03.454 --> 11:06.165
{\an3}So what about taking Steven
and I for a ride-along?

11:06.248 --> 11:07.792
{\an3}STEVE:
Oh, wow.

11:07.875 --> 11:09.710
{\an1}GLEN: You guys work
at a newspaper, right?

11:09.794 --> 11:12.046
{\an1}Yeah, right. You teach us,
we teach our readers.

11:12.129 --> 11:14.090
{\an1}And Steve will get
to stare at the back

11:14.173 --> 11:15.383
of Tammy's head all night.

11:15.466 --> 11:18.260
{\an3}At this point,
I'll take what I can get.

11:18.344 --> 11:20.137
We'd have to clear it first.

11:20.221 --> 11:21.472
Yeah, that'll take a day.

11:21.555 --> 11:22.765
Tomorrow night all right?

11:22.848 --> 11:23.766
Works for me.

11:23.849 --> 11:25.434
Yeah, that's great.

11:25.518 --> 11:27.269
All right, dress warm.

11:27.353 --> 11:29.188
{\an3}Oh, yeah.

11:31.148 --> 11:32.608
DAVID:
<i>Hey, I'm gonna go get you</i>

11:32.692 --> 11:34.276
something to eat,
so just hang out

11:34.360 --> 11:35.444
and relax, all right?

11:35.528 --> 11:40.282
{\an3}David, I'm not tired.
I need a job.

11:40.366 --> 11:42.368
{\an1}Not right now,
you don't.

11:46.831 --> 11:48.374
(sighs)

11:48.457 --> 11:49.625
(sighs)

11:52.211 --> 11:55.131
Look, Val, um...

11:55.214 --> 11:56.882
I know it's hard to believe,

11:56.966 --> 12:01.387
{\an1}but this is... gonna
get easier eventually.

12:03.389 --> 12:07.852
And after the trial,
public humiliation.

12:09.186 --> 12:11.313
{\an1}(sighs)

12:11.397 --> 12:14.024
You want to call the D.A.?

12:16.026 --> 12:18.487
You want to tell him
you changed your mind

12:18.571 --> 12:20.489
about filing charges?

12:22.867 --> 12:25.286
I don't remember it.

12:27.455 --> 12:33.085
{\an3}How come something
I didn't feel hurts so bad?

12:42.261 --> 12:44.180
Dinner smells great.
Thanks.

12:44.263 --> 12:45.139
I thought...

12:45.222 --> 12:47.516
{\an1}I thought you were staying
with Donna tonight.

12:47.600 --> 12:50.144
I was... until her pain
pills knocked her out.

12:50.227 --> 12:51.520
{\an6}Oh.
I just needed
something to keep

12:51.604 --> 12:53.522
{\an6}my mind off
things, you know?
Yeah.

12:53.606 --> 12:57.234
Hey, um, you mind
if I take some up to Val?

12:57.318 --> 13:00.029
Of course not.

13:00.112 --> 13:01.489
She's having a real tough time.

13:01.572 --> 13:02.948
Thanks for asking.

13:05.784 --> 13:09.413
{\an1}You know, I'm really trying
not to be mad at you

13:09.497 --> 13:11.081
for letting her stay.

13:11.165 --> 13:14.043
{\an3}You know, Kel, it is possible
that Val's the victim here.

13:14.126 --> 13:15.252
I don't think so.

13:15.336 --> 13:17.505
How could anyone make up a story
like that?

13:17.588 --> 13:19.381
If I've learned one thing
this year,

13:19.465 --> 13:22.843
it's that people are capable
of anything.

13:26.514 --> 13:27.973
(sighs)

13:28.057 --> 13:30.976
I can't believe the patient
is able to sit up

13:31.060 --> 13:32.561
and take nourishment.
You know what, Steve?

13:32.645 --> 13:34.063
Instead of the stupid comments,

13:34.146 --> 13:36.065
why don't you just say
what's on your mind, all right?

13:36.148 --> 13:38.943
Déjà vu: You know when Valerie
pretended to have an abortion,

13:39.026 --> 13:41.529
I was the one who took her meals
upstairs to her.

13:41.612 --> 13:43.322
You know what? I don't even want
to hear this right now.

13:43.405 --> 13:45.407
Well, maybe you should
hear this:

13:45.491 --> 13:47.826
Valerie slept with Noah,
passed out in his office

13:47.910 --> 13:49.161
and got busted by you.

13:49.245 --> 13:51.413
And when she saw you,
she needed an excuse,

13:51.497 --> 13:53.249
so she claims
that she was raped, all right?

13:53.332 --> 13:55.042
She swallows some roofies,
Stop, Steve.

13:55.125 --> 13:56.418
{\an3}and then she has
you to support her

13:56.502 --> 13:58.462
Steve...
and an angle on his millions.

13:58.546 --> 14:00.089
Dude, why don't you
just shut up!

14:00.172 --> 14:01.131
Hey, hey, hey!

14:01.215 --> 14:02.633
Hey, hey, come on, come on,
come on, back off!

14:02.716 --> 14:03.634
David, stop it!

14:03.717 --> 14:04.927
Okay, okay,
okay, okay!

14:05.010 --> 14:06.595
Get off me!
Tell him, Brandon!

14:06.679 --> 14:08.931
Tell him! He's too blind
to see it!

14:11.392 --> 14:13.769
Yeah, Brandon,
tell us what you think.

14:13.852 --> 14:15.813
I've heard from Steve.
I know what Kelly thinks.

14:15.896 --> 14:17.064
What about you, huh?

14:17.147 --> 14:19.275
{\an3}I don't know
what to think.

14:19.358 --> 14:20.776
(phone rings)

14:20.859 --> 14:22.236
I'll get it.

14:25.864 --> 14:28.284
Hello.

14:28.367 --> 14:29.952
Yeah, just a minute.

14:30.035 --> 14:31.620
Valerie, it's for you.

14:31.704 --> 14:33.330
It's the D.A.'s office.

14:34.248 --> 14:37.835
Hello. Yeah, speaking.

14:39.003 --> 14:40.296
VALERIE:
Really?

14:40.379 --> 14:41.422
And that's final?

14:41.505 --> 14:44.425
Yeah, yeah, okay.

14:44.508 --> 14:46.468
Yeah, just forget it.

14:47.720 --> 14:49.638
The D.A.'s not filing.

14:49.722 --> 14:51.974
What? I'm, I'm sorry. What?

14:52.057 --> 14:53.309
{\an3}Why not?

14:53.392 --> 14:55.311
Insufficient evidence.

14:55.394 --> 14:57.313
I guess they don't
believe me either.

14:58.564 --> 15:01.859
{\an1}All right, come on.
You're staying at my place.

15:01.942 --> 15:04.111
{\an3}Val, you're welcome
to stay here.

15:05.446 --> 15:07.156
{\an3}It certainly doesn't
feel like it.

15:22.588 --> 15:24.423
You're saying
the D.A. didn't do his job?

15:24.506 --> 15:28.177
{\an3}Part of it.
Someone drugged her.

15:28.260 --> 15:29.678
{\an5}STEVE:
Well, that's still open
for debate.

15:29.762 --> 15:31.889
{\an5}DONNA:
One I don't want to have
this morning.

15:31.972 --> 15:33.891
Donna, we're on Noah's side.

15:33.974 --> 15:35.392
My boyfriend slept
with another woman.

15:35.476 --> 15:37.895
I'm supposed to feel good
that you're on his side?

15:37.978 --> 15:39.396
{\an1}It's not like that,
Donna, come on!

15:39.480 --> 15:41.482
{\an5}I can't deal with
this right now.
Donna...

15:41.565 --> 15:43.108
{\an1}Can I get a ride?
DONNA: Yeah. Let's go.

15:43.192 --> 15:45.694
{\an1}Okay, you guys be careful
on your drive-along.

15:45.778 --> 15:49.198
{\an1}Hey, I hear
they dropped the charges.

15:49.281 --> 15:51.492
{\an3}I don't know what
to say to you.

15:51.575 --> 15:52.868
How about you're glad
I'm not being charged

15:52.951 --> 15:54.036
for a crime I didn't commit?

15:54.119 --> 15:56.372
I loved you.

15:56.455 --> 15:58.415
{\an1}Well, she's not
gonna hear you out,

15:58.499 --> 16:01.377
{\an1}but maybe she'll
listen to me.

16:02.586 --> 16:03.712
Congratulations.

16:03.796 --> 16:06.048
{\an3}Thanks, man.
Oh, yeah.

16:06.131 --> 16:08.509
Yeah, great news.

16:08.592 --> 16:10.219
I gotta tell you I didn't do it?

16:10.302 --> 16:11.720
You did plenty.

16:11.804 --> 16:13.472
Nothing you haven't done.

16:19.478 --> 16:21.230
{\an1}JOSH:
Donna.

16:21.313 --> 16:23.857
Hey, is your back
feeling any better?

16:23.941 --> 16:25.567
No, but I'm taking my pills.

16:25.651 --> 16:28.278
The jump start I told you about.

16:29.613 --> 16:30.572
Well, you're dragging, right?

16:30.656 --> 16:31.740
Yeah, a little bit.

16:31.824 --> 16:35.536
{\an1}Okay, well, take it,
don't take it.

16:35.619 --> 16:37.663
At least you got it
in case you need it, right?

16:37.746 --> 16:39.540
Thanks.

16:39.623 --> 16:42.376
Uh, you know, uh,
Noah's a wreck.

16:42.459 --> 16:44.420
He should be.

16:44.503 --> 16:46.255
You just tell him
what he needs to do

16:46.338 --> 16:48.424
{\an1}to make it up to you,
and he'll do it.

16:49.550 --> 16:50.426
Anything at all.

16:50.509 --> 16:51.552
{\an3}Anything?

16:51.635 --> 16:52.845
Just name it.

16:52.928 --> 16:54.847
{\an3}Make it so the other night
never happened.

17:14.700 --> 17:16.076
Hey.

17:16.160 --> 17:18.787
{\an3}I, uh, was kind of
hoping you'd sleep in.

17:18.871 --> 17:21.123
Jasper called.
He's at home.

17:21.205 --> 17:22.790
{\an3}Ah, he's just trying to
schedule studio time tonight.

17:22.875 --> 17:24.626
{\an1}I'll tell him
I can't make it.

17:24.710 --> 17:27.755
{\an3}David, look, there's nothing
you can do for me, okay?

17:30.758 --> 17:33.469
{\an1}Um, you know,
I-I was thinking,

17:33.552 --> 17:37.639
{\an1}maybe, uh, maybe we could
call the D.A.,

17:37.723 --> 17:40.142
{\an1}you know, see if
he'll change his mind.

17:40.225 --> 17:42.478
{\an3}What, and convince
a man it's, it's a crime

17:42.561 --> 17:44.480
{\an3}to knock out a woman
and have sex with her?

17:44.563 --> 17:45.439
That's what men want.

17:45.522 --> 17:46.815
Valerie...

17:46.899 --> 17:48.317
That's what men
want from me.

17:48.400 --> 17:49.610
No, I don't think so.

17:49.693 --> 17:51.195
Really? Come on, David.

17:51.278 --> 17:53.155
The only reason you and I are
together is because of the sex.

17:53.238 --> 17:54.281
Excuse me?

17:54.364 --> 17:55.282
No, it's not.

17:55.365 --> 17:56.533
Really?

17:57.785 --> 17:59.161
Val, come on.

17:59.244 --> 18:01.121
{\an1}Come on.

18:01.205 --> 18:02.831
Stop, okay?

18:02.915 --> 18:04.291
Stop, please.

18:05.250 --> 18:07.002
{\an1}Come on.
Val,

18:07.086 --> 18:08.295
don't, don't do this.

18:08.378 --> 18:09.213
{\an3}What?

18:09.296 --> 18:10.798
I talk too much? You
want me drugged, too?

18:10.881 --> 18:13.342
No, Val, I don't.

18:13.425 --> 18:16.178
Well, then you're the only one.

18:18.222 --> 18:19.473
(sighs)

18:23.435 --> 18:25.646
I want people to know
what he did was wrong.

18:28.273 --> 18:30.025
And what he did matters.

18:30.108 --> 18:32.361
I know it does. We'll...

18:32.444 --> 18:34.404
We'll make them see, okay?

18:34.488 --> 18:35.823
How?

18:35.906 --> 18:38.158
I don't know, but we will.

18:38.242 --> 18:39.743
(sighs)

18:45.958 --> 18:48.210
Can I use your sharpener?

18:48.293 --> 18:49.086
{\an1}My what?

18:49.169 --> 18:50.212
Pencil sharpener.

18:50.295 --> 18:53.382
{\an3}Or does the master designer
go straight to markers?

18:53.465 --> 18:55.050
Hardly. Here you go.

18:55.134 --> 18:56.218
Thanks.

18:56.301 --> 18:57.219
Cute.

18:57.302 --> 18:58.387
Where's the rest?

18:58.470 --> 18:59.596
{\an3}Ladies,
status report.

18:59.680 --> 19:02.057
{\an3}Boys' playwear is already
on the board.

19:02.140 --> 19:03.141
Great. Donna, how's
the girls' line?

19:03.225 --> 19:05.769
{\an1}I'm having a little trouble
with the design patterns.

19:05.853 --> 19:06.770
Kind of stuck.

19:06.854 --> 19:09.022
Unstick and be prepared
to stay late tonight.

19:09.106 --> 19:10.274
I need those sketches by 6:00

19:10.357 --> 19:12.109
so we can review
and make changes tonight.

19:13.527 --> 19:16.280
Donna... you need Danielle
to back you up?

19:16.363 --> 19:18.240
I have some great ideas
on the girls' line.

19:18.323 --> 19:20.242
We could put those
on the board, too.

19:20.325 --> 19:22.202
Thanks, but you're busy.

19:22.286 --> 19:23.245
I'll have 'em done.

19:23.328 --> 19:24.413
If we need to reschedule...

19:24.496 --> 19:25.581
We'll be ready.

19:31.837 --> 19:33.255
(sighs)

19:39.887 --> 19:42.723
JOSH:
<i>Take it, don't take it.</i>

19:42.806 --> 19:44.850
{\an5}(voice echoing):
<i>At least you got it</i>
<i>in case you need it, right?</i>

19:44.933 --> 19:48.604
<i>At least you got it</i>
<i>in case you need it, right?</i>

20:00.032 --> 20:01.450
(sighs)

20:02.367 --> 20:03.785
(garbled police radio
transmission)

20:03.869 --> 20:05.787
{\an3}I told you date rape's
hard to prove.

20:05.871 --> 20:09.458
So, I guess you're not surprised
the D.A. didn't file, huh?

20:09.541 --> 20:11.251
Jeopardize
his conviction rate?

20:11.335 --> 20:12.211
Yeah, I'm
real shocked.

20:12.294 --> 20:14.421
Well, in this case,
he did the right thing.

20:14.504 --> 20:17.132
Oh, I'm sure your pal's
a real Boy Scout.

20:17.215 --> 20:19.927
He said, off
the record.

20:20.010 --> 20:21.470
{\an1}STEVE:
Oh, that's okay.

20:21.553 --> 20:23.597
{\an3}This is for promotional
purposes only.

20:24.848 --> 20:26.808
{\an1}So, how long you guys
been partners?

20:26.892 --> 20:29.519
{\an3}Um, what, a couple
of months now?

20:29.603 --> 20:31.063
{\an1}STEVE:
A couple of months?

20:31.146 --> 20:33.023
Gosh, it must take a long time

20:33.106 --> 20:34.441
to really operate
as a team though.

20:34.524 --> 20:36.318
Years.

20:36.401 --> 20:38.153
How long were you with
your last partner, Glen?

20:39.446 --> 20:41.323
Four years, wasn't it?

20:41.406 --> 20:43.992
Five.

20:44.076 --> 20:47.162
Five years with the same guy
must get kind of boring.

20:47.245 --> 20:49.164
Is that why you switched?

20:49.247 --> 20:50.999
Not exactly.

20:51.083 --> 20:52.292
He died in my arms.

20:52.376 --> 20:54.252
(radio chirps)

20:54.336 --> 20:56.213
DISPATCHER:
Nine Adam sixty-one.

20:56.296 --> 20:58.256
Possible, two-eleven
at Third and Willow,

20:58.340 --> 20:59.800
convenience store on the corner.

20:59.883 --> 21:02.678
Suspect male Hispanic,
medium height and build,

21:02.761 --> 21:04.346
light jacket, dark jeans,
armed with a knife.

21:04.429 --> 21:05.681
Handle Code Three.

21:05.764 --> 21:07.140
Hold on, boys.
Here we go.

21:07.224 --> 21:09.184
(siren blaring)

21:13.772 --> 21:14.982
That looks like Louie.

21:15.065 --> 21:17.359
{\an5}That's our guy.
BRANDON:
How do you know?

21:17.442 --> 21:19.152
{\an1}He's a petty thief, user.
I've busted him a dozen times.

21:19.236 --> 21:20.779
(tires screeching)

21:24.783 --> 21:27.244
(panting)

21:27.327 --> 21:29.204
(tires screeching)

21:30.455 --> 21:32.082
GLEN:
This is nine Adam sixty one.

21:32.165 --> 21:33.417
Suspect cornered alleyway 300

21:33.500 --> 21:35.002
{\an3}block of Willow Street.
Request back up.

21:35.085 --> 21:37.045
{\an6}GLEN:
We got this guy,
we got him.

21:37.129 --> 21:38.171
(grunts)

21:40.173 --> 21:41.675
You two stay put.

21:41.758 --> 21:43.218
(Louie grunting)

21:43.301 --> 21:44.928
Your hands where I can see 'em!

21:45.012 --> 21:46.430
(grunting)

21:46.513 --> 21:48.181
{\an1}GLEN:
Hey, Louie!

21:48.265 --> 21:50.892
What did she say, huh?
Get down off that thing!

21:50.976 --> 21:51.893
(groans)

21:51.977 --> 21:53.228
(yelling)

21:53.311 --> 21:55.230
{\an1}LOUIE:
I didn't do nothing.

21:55.313 --> 21:56.523
{\an1}You didn't do nothing, huh?
I was just walking

21:56.606 --> 21:58.066
down the street.
Give me that gun!

21:58.150 --> 22:00.027
You have the right
to remain silent.

22:00.110 --> 22:01.570
Anything you say can and
will be used against you

22:01.653 --> 22:02.612
in a court of law.

22:02.696 --> 22:04.031
{\an1}Do you understand
that, huh?

22:04.114 --> 22:06.033
What do we got here, huh?

22:06.116 --> 22:08.368
{\an1}Looks like a knife
and a bunch of bucks, huh?

22:08.452 --> 22:10.746
(siren wailing)

22:10.829 --> 22:11.955
{\an3}Where are the drugs, huh?
(screaming)

22:12.039 --> 22:13.415
Glen!

22:14.833 --> 22:17.919
(Glen shouting,
Louie groaning)

22:18.003 --> 22:19.463
Man, look at that guy.

22:19.546 --> 22:22.591
{\an1}I'm looking,
and I don't like what I see.

22:22.674 --> 22:24.593
LOUIE:
That cop beat me up!

22:24.676 --> 22:27.512
{\an5}GLEN:
You got a gun, Louie?
You got a gun?

22:34.186 --> 22:35.395
Need a hand?

22:37.022 --> 22:38.565
Your back bothering you?

22:38.648 --> 22:41.359
No, I'm fine.

22:41.443 --> 22:42.986
Uh, I basically used
the same central idea

22:43.070 --> 22:44.446
for playwear
as well as dress up.

22:44.529 --> 22:45.781
Nice tie-in.

22:45.864 --> 22:47.157
{\an1}There's no need
to go over this now.

22:47.240 --> 22:48.617
Double-lined,
reinforced knees...

22:48.700 --> 22:50.660
You came up with all this
in the last few hours?

22:50.744 --> 22:51.828
{\an3}Well, so we'd have
time to revise.

22:51.912 --> 22:53.121
That's the plan, right?

22:53.205 --> 22:55.415
The sales presentation's
been pushed back a day.

22:55.499 --> 22:57.417
We can review tomorrow.

22:57.501 --> 22:59.127
I thought we were
working tonight.

22:59.211 --> 23:01.296
So did I.

23:01.379 --> 23:03.090
Go home and get some sleep.

23:03.173 --> 23:05.926
{\an1}We'll make a fresh start
in the morning.

23:14.392 --> 23:16.520
I thought
you'd be reopened by now.

23:16.603 --> 23:18.647
Big victory bash.

23:20.565 --> 23:22.109
Look, I'm not celebrating.

23:22.192 --> 23:24.111
{\an3}You know, my friends
think I made it all up.

23:24.194 --> 23:25.654
I don't.

23:25.737 --> 23:27.656
{\an3}They can't even
look me in the eye.

23:27.739 --> 23:29.658
{\an3}It's kind of strange
that you can.

23:29.741 --> 23:31.493
Look, I believe
you're a victim here.

23:31.576 --> 23:33.453
But it's not my fault.

23:33.537 --> 23:35.497
{\an1}You came on to me as much
as I came on to you.

23:35.580 --> 23:38.333
You'd better work up
a better defense than that.

23:38.416 --> 23:40.127
Look, you're the only one
I have to convince here.

23:40.210 --> 23:42.671
Oh, and you actually
think you could.

23:42.754 --> 23:44.464
God, your arrogance is amazing.

23:44.548 --> 23:46.341
{\an3}But I guess
it's gonna work

23:46.424 --> 23:47.676
really well for you
on the stand.

23:47.759 --> 23:50.303
What are you talking about?

23:50.387 --> 23:51.513
The civil trial.

23:51.596 --> 23:53.849
I'm gonna file suit.

23:53.932 --> 23:56.017
I want everybody
to know what you did to me.

23:56.101 --> 23:59.020
{\an3}But don't worry.
Chin up.

23:59.104 --> 24:02.315
$10 million in damages
beats 20 years in jail.

24:15.328 --> 24:16.454
And so what are
you gonna do, huh?

24:16.538 --> 24:17.581
Call your pal Arnie Greenwalt?

24:17.664 --> 24:19.583
{\an1}I've handled
nuisance suits before.

24:19.666 --> 24:21.418
{\an3}Not everybody takes
a bribe, Josh.

24:21.501 --> 24:23.211
{\an1}And I'm not suggesting
we make one.

24:23.295 --> 24:25.005
I mean, knowing Valerie,
she'll go cheap.

24:25.088 --> 24:26.047
I'm not going to settle.

24:26.131 --> 24:28.758
I don't blame you
for not wanting

24:28.842 --> 24:30.218
{\an1}to give in to
a girl like her.

24:30.302 --> 24:31.928
A girl like her?
But if it'll make

24:32.012 --> 24:33.930
this thing go away,
I say we give the gold digger

24:34.014 --> 24:35.015
a little gold, that's all.

24:35.098 --> 24:38.393
{\an3}You have no idea what
kind of girl she is, okay?

24:38.476 --> 24:39.227
I was just saying....

24:39.311 --> 24:40.228
{\an3}I know what you
were saying, Josh.

24:40.312 --> 24:41.354
I don't like it.

24:41.438 --> 24:43.440
{\an1}I was just saying
that if a few dollars

24:43.523 --> 24:45.400
{\an1}will make this thing
go away, it's worth it.

24:45.483 --> 24:48.278
I pay her off and everyone
I know thinks I'm guilty.

24:48.361 --> 24:49.738
I won't.

24:49.821 --> 24:52.574
{\an3}(sighs)
Look, man, I'm sorry.

24:52.657 --> 24:55.452
{\an1}Hey, Noah,
forget about it, all right?

24:55.535 --> 24:58.413
{\an3}The important thing here is,
someone out there caused this.

24:58.496 --> 24:59.247
(phone ringing)

24:59.331 --> 25:01.333
I wish I could get
my hands on them.

25:05.837 --> 25:07.380
Hello?

25:07.464 --> 25:08.965
Hey.

25:09.049 --> 25:10.550
{\an3}Hey, look, I'm really
glad you called.

25:10.634 --> 25:13.094
We need to talk.

25:13.178 --> 25:15.680
Yeah. Yeah, I know, but...

25:18.516 --> 25:21.436
Josh, it's Donna. She
wants to talk to you.

25:25.357 --> 25:27.567
Yeah, this is Josh.

25:31.196 --> 25:32.280
So, that was a slow night?

25:32.364 --> 25:35.825
Glen's just busting you.
Four calls is a lot of action.

25:35.909 --> 25:37.244
{\an3}Listen, about the one
in the alley...

25:37.327 --> 25:38.411
That was the best.

25:38.495 --> 25:40.121
The way you cornered
that guy was amazing.

25:40.205 --> 25:41.790
Is there any chance
I can talk to him?

25:41.873 --> 25:43.833
You got to take charge
with guys like Louie.

25:43.917 --> 25:46.461
That angel dust makes them
think they're invincible.

25:46.544 --> 25:48.296
{\an1}That's where the nightstick
comes in, I guess.

25:48.380 --> 25:49.256
Hmm?

25:49.339 --> 25:51.258
Just what kind of an article
are you writing?

25:51.341 --> 25:52.676
An honest one, I hope.

25:52.759 --> 25:54.928
That's what you'd want me
to write, isn't it?

25:55.011 --> 25:57.138
Yeah, just so long as
it's no hatchet job.

25:57.222 --> 25:58.765
You want to talk
to Louie, talk.

25:58.848 --> 26:01.476
{\an3}My advice is that you wait
till the PCP wears off.

26:01.559 --> 26:04.187
Yeah, I know you said he was
on drugs, but I couldn't tell.

26:04.271 --> 26:05.981
How could you?

26:06.064 --> 26:07.983
{\an3}Experience.

26:08.066 --> 26:09.985
That's where the
baton comes in.

26:21.579 --> 26:25.125
{\an1}Hi.

26:25.208 --> 26:27.711
Hi. Thanks for coming.

26:27.794 --> 26:30.005
I'm glad to do it.

26:30.088 --> 26:33.341
Plus, it gives me the chance
to lobby on Noah's behalf.

26:33.425 --> 26:34.551
I'd rather you didn't.

26:34.634 --> 26:38.221
Yeah. So, I'm glad
the pills helped.

26:38.305 --> 26:40.849
{\an3}I wouldn't have called...
(sighs)

26:40.932 --> 26:43.977
{\an3}I mean, I know it was an
awkward situation, but I...

26:44.060 --> 26:46.021
{\an3}If I didn't have this big
presentation at work...

26:46.104 --> 26:47.022
{\an1}I know.

26:47.105 --> 26:50.525
Look, I, uh, brought you two,
like you asked,

26:50.608 --> 26:52.193
but I've got more.

26:53.903 --> 26:59.075
No, I ju... I just... need these
to get through my presentation.

27:02.662 --> 27:04.831
I guess you heard
about Valerie's lawsuit?

27:04.914 --> 27:07.167
What?

27:17.761 --> 27:20.221
Hey, there he is.

27:20.305 --> 27:21.556
What's going on?

27:21.639 --> 27:23.558
{\an1}It's the company.
They're worried about you.

27:23.641 --> 27:25.643
That's great to hear.

27:25.727 --> 27:28.772
{\an1}No, they're worried
about your commitment.

27:28.855 --> 27:30.774
All I need is just
a few more nights.

27:30.857 --> 27:32.776
{\an1}Okay, I'm going
to get them for you.

27:32.859 --> 27:34.319
But I think you should know

27:34.402 --> 27:36.946
{\an1}the company's talking
about dumping you.

27:41.076 --> 27:42.744
Great.

27:42.827 --> 27:44.245
$10 million.

27:44.329 --> 27:45.997
Typical Valerie.

27:46.081 --> 27:47.457
You know, it would
mean a lot to Noah,

27:47.540 --> 27:49.250
knowing he had
your support.

27:49.334 --> 27:51.378
{\an3}Yeah, well,
it was worth a try.

27:51.461 --> 27:53.088
You're a good brother.

27:53.171 --> 27:54.589
{\an3}Thanks.

27:54.672 --> 27:57.092
That means more to me
than you can imagine.

27:57.175 --> 27:58.927
{\an3}Listen, good luck
with your presentation.

27:59.010 --> 28:00.387
Thank you.

28:00.470 --> 28:02.472
Hi.
Hey.

28:04.015 --> 28:06.601
{\an1}Well, we always knew
what Valerie was.

28:06.684 --> 28:09.312
Now we even know her price.

28:09.396 --> 28:10.939
{\an3}You know I was really hoping
this whole situation

28:11.022 --> 28:12.857
wouldn't affect our friendship.

28:12.941 --> 28:17.070
You're right. I'm sorry.

28:17.153 --> 28:20.448
It's just weird, you know?

28:20.532 --> 28:23.284
Noah and Valerie always thinking
we were cheating on them and...

28:23.368 --> 28:25.620
they were the ones
who ended up sleeping together.

28:25.703 --> 28:28.415
{\an3}Wait, wait.
They didn't sleep together.

28:28.498 --> 28:30.458
{\an3}Noah raped her.
That's a big difference.

28:30.542 --> 28:32.293
{\an1}Well, the D.A.
didn't think so.

28:32.377 --> 28:34.170
{\an3}Which is why Val
filed her own lawsuit.

28:34.254 --> 28:36.423
Confirming that she's simply
in it for the money.

28:36.506 --> 28:38.383
{\an3}Okay, I guess
it's safe to say that

28:38.466 --> 28:41.094
you're taking Noah's side.

28:41.177 --> 28:42.929
About the rape?
Yes, definitely.

28:43.012 --> 28:44.764
Well, I believe Val.

28:44.848 --> 28:46.850
Fine.

28:53.398 --> 28:54.941
I know you like her, Steve.

28:55.024 --> 28:56.317
{\an3}That has nothing to do
with it, Brandon.

28:56.401 --> 28:58.319
{\an6}Uh-huh.
Nothing happened
last night.

28:58.403 --> 29:00.196
{\an3}Really? Try telling
that to Louie.

29:00.280 --> 29:02.490
{\an1}Maybe they failed to cross
a "T" or dot an "I."

29:02.574 --> 29:03.867
Maybe.

29:03.950 --> 29:05.493
{\an1}But that doesn't mean
they should be crucified

29:05.577 --> 29:06.661
in the media.

29:06.744 --> 29:07.787
Hi.
Hi.

29:07.871 --> 29:09.998
{\an1}I just came by to see if
you made it home in one piece.

29:10.081 --> 29:10.957
{\an3}Yeah, we did.
Feel free

29:11.040 --> 29:12.500
{\an3}to offer up something
less controversial

29:12.584 --> 29:14.335
to talk about, please.

29:14.419 --> 29:17.839
{\an1}Okay, how about
Valerie's lawsuit?

29:17.922 --> 29:20.175
She filed a civil action
claiming sexual battery.

29:20.258 --> 29:21.259
{\an3}How much?

29:21.342 --> 29:22.469
This isn't about money.

29:22.552 --> 29:24.137
Ten million.

29:24.220 --> 29:25.388
{\an3}I'm sorry,
you were saying?

29:25.472 --> 29:27.348
Steve, you heard the cops
last night.

29:27.432 --> 29:29.184
Just because the D.A.
doesn't file,

29:29.267 --> 29:30.727
doesn't mean a crime
wasn't committed.

29:30.810 --> 29:32.896
{\an4}(door opens)
Doesn't mean there was,
either.

29:34.898 --> 29:36.733
Sorry, I thought
you'd be at work.

29:36.816 --> 29:37.859
It's okay.

29:37.942 --> 29:38.818
We worked last night.

29:38.902 --> 29:42.238
I just came by to pick up
a few things.

29:42.322 --> 29:43.907
Valerie, wait just a second.

29:43.990 --> 29:45.825
{\an1}I'm curious.
How did you come

29:45.909 --> 29:47.702
upon that ten million figure?

29:47.785 --> 29:48.828
Were you thinking house,

29:48.912 --> 29:50.580
car, vacation spread...?

29:50.663 --> 29:51.915
{\an4}STEVE:
Yeah, yeah,
did you take

29:51.998 --> 29:54.042
into account
the lawyer's 30% cut?

29:55.460 --> 29:58.171
Or is that just the price
of dignity these days?

29:58.254 --> 30:01.007
So what are you waiting for?

30:01.799 --> 30:02.800
At least they have the courage

30:02.884 --> 30:04.010
to trash me to my face.

30:04.093 --> 30:06.012
I told you you're welcome here.

30:06.095 --> 30:07.514
You still are.

30:08.306 --> 30:09.390
I want him to admit

30:09.474 --> 30:10.350
what he did.

30:10.433 --> 30:13.186
If I got that and a nickel,
I'd be happy.

30:14.521 --> 30:16.731
You defend Louie,
you defend her.

30:16.814 --> 30:18.775
Brother, you're getting soft
on me.

30:22.820 --> 30:24.364
You were a little hard on her.

30:24.447 --> 30:25.240
Yeah?

30:25.323 --> 30:26.616
Well, I think
you were a little easy.

30:26.699 --> 30:27.575
Really?

30:27.659 --> 30:29.285
Really.

30:32.205 --> 30:35.166
To recap: playwear
and dress wear.

30:35.250 --> 30:37.126
All for one, and one for all.

30:37.210 --> 30:38.419
I'm done.

30:38.503 --> 30:39.754
{\an1}GWINNETT:
Thank you, Donna.

30:39.837 --> 30:41.297
And now I'd like Danielle
to present...

30:41.381 --> 30:42.382
No need.

30:42.465 --> 30:45.218
But you haven't heard our ideas
on the boy's line.

30:45.301 --> 30:47.095
Why should I?

30:47.178 --> 30:50.390
If it's half as good as what
Donna designed for the girls,

30:50.473 --> 30:52.433
then it's 50% better than
what's already out there.

30:52.517 --> 30:53.309
You liked it?

30:53.393 --> 30:55.270
I can make any adjustment
you want.

30:55.353 --> 30:56.437
More. Less. Pattern. Shorter.

30:56.521 --> 30:57.438
{\an3}Longer.

30:57.522 --> 30:59.440
I want it just the way it is.

30:59.524 --> 31:01.484
Can you present this to my
partners tomorrow morning?

31:01.568 --> 31:03.278
{\an3}Sure.
Absolute-ly.

31:03.361 --> 31:06.447
Same theme, same flats...

31:06.531 --> 31:08.283
same energy.

31:08.366 --> 31:10.368
Great.

31:19.377 --> 31:21.421
{\an1}Coming.

31:24.549 --> 31:25.466
{\an3}David.

31:25.550 --> 31:26.926
It's good to see you.

31:27.010 --> 31:28.511
I understand
Valerie's staying here.

31:28.595 --> 31:29.971
{\an1}Uh, yeah.

31:30.054 --> 31:31.472
You know what?
She's not available.

31:31.556 --> 31:33.308
{\an1}VALERIE:
Who is it?

31:33.391 --> 31:35.101
Noah's brother.

31:35.184 --> 31:37.312
Val, it's, it's no one you need
to talk to, all right?

31:37.395 --> 31:38.479
You want to.

31:38.563 --> 31:40.315
{\an3}Trust me.

31:40.398 --> 31:41.941
Um, alone.

31:42.025 --> 31:43.943
David, it-it's okay.

31:44.027 --> 31:46.029
{\an1}Really.
(sardonic laugh)

31:51.075 --> 31:53.119
What is it?

31:54.078 --> 31:55.622
This lawsuit.

31:55.705 --> 31:57.290
Uh, it's so unnecessary.

31:57.373 --> 31:59.292
Well, I don't think so.

31:59.375 --> 32:01.127
Well, you got no witness.

32:01.210 --> 32:03.171
Circumstantial evidence.

32:03.254 --> 32:04.672
{\an3}You've got no shot
at winning.

32:04.756 --> 32:06.341
Do you want to just cut
to the chase?

32:06.424 --> 32:08.343
You want money.

32:08.426 --> 32:10.970
So why give your lawyer a third?

32:12.430 --> 32:15.475
Here's a cashier's
check for 200,000.

32:15.558 --> 32:18.227
What's the catch?

32:18.311 --> 32:19.395
{\an3}No catch.

32:19.479 --> 32:22.023
No trial, either.

32:22.106 --> 32:24.025
{\an3}No exposure
of your private life,

32:24.108 --> 32:27.153
no character assassination.

32:31.783 --> 32:33.785
Just the bottom line.

32:43.920 --> 32:45.254
(phone ringing)

32:45.338 --> 32:46.798
(seagulls calling)

32:50.802 --> 32:52.845
{\an3}Donna, you can't answer
the phone?

32:56.140 --> 32:58.351
Hello?

32:58.434 --> 33:00.353
{\an3}Hey, David.

33:00.436 --> 33:02.480
{\an3}Yeah.

33:02.563 --> 33:04.023
{\an3}He what?

33:04.107 --> 33:06.609
Wow, I can't believe it.

33:08.319 --> 33:10.238
Kelly, where are my pills?

33:10.321 --> 33:11.906
Have you seen them?

33:11.989 --> 33:13.032
Just a second.

33:13.116 --> 33:14.117
And what happened?

33:14.200 --> 33:15.410
Kel, I need them,

33:15.493 --> 33:17.328
and I can't find them.

33:17.412 --> 33:18.371
{\an1}They were
right here.

33:18.454 --> 33:19.956
You know, David,

33:20.039 --> 33:21.582
it's not really a good time.

33:21.666 --> 33:24.043
Yeah, I'll tell her.

33:24.127 --> 33:25.294
{\an1}Kelly!

33:25.378 --> 33:27.088
Did you move them?
Because I had them.

33:27.171 --> 33:29.841
Is this what you're looking for?

33:31.092 --> 33:32.385
Yes.

33:33.511 --> 33:35.388
Pain's that bad, huh?

33:35.471 --> 33:39.434
No, I just like taking pills
that completely knock me out.

33:39.517 --> 33:40.727
{\an3}Donna...
Especially when

33:40.810 --> 33:43.062
{\an3}I have a huge presentation
at work, yeah.

33:47.942 --> 33:49.944
{\an3}(exhales)

33:51.487 --> 33:54.073
What did David want?

33:55.366 --> 33:57.285
Noah offered to settle.

33:57.368 --> 33:58.119
What?!

33:58.202 --> 34:00.288
{\an3}Josh made the proposal
last night.

34:00.371 --> 34:02.165
(sighs):
How much?

34:02.248 --> 34:03.791
$200,000.

34:03.875 --> 34:05.460
{\an3}David doesn't know
if Valerie's

34:05.543 --> 34:06.461
taking it or not.

34:06.544 --> 34:08.337
Of course she's gonna take it.

34:08.420 --> 34:10.339
God, how can Noah be so stupid?

34:10.422 --> 34:13.009
Maybe he just wants
to put this behind him.

34:13.092 --> 34:14.135
{\an1}What,
by admitting guilt?

34:14.217 --> 34:16.471
'Cause that is exactly
what everyone's gonna think.

34:16.554 --> 34:18.473
I really can't deal
with this right now.

34:18.556 --> 34:20.516
I've got to work
on my presentation.

34:22.893 --> 34:24.437
What? What?

34:24.520 --> 34:26.272
I'm just a little
worried about you.

34:26.355 --> 34:27.523
Well, thank you,

34:27.607 --> 34:28.815
but I am fine.

34:28.900 --> 34:31.152
I just need to...

34:34.405 --> 34:36.239
Mother, may I?

34:40.411 --> 34:42.455
(dialing)

34:47.251 --> 34:49.670
{\an5}I said no settlement!
In order to get
the money,

34:49.754 --> 34:51.297
she has to sign an agreement

34:51.380 --> 34:52.465
{\an1}acknowledging
no admission of guilt.

34:52.547 --> 34:54.509
(phone ringing)
She agreed to that?

34:54.592 --> 34:56.677
{\an3}Yeah. I gave her
24 hours.

34:56.761 --> 34:57.678
Yeah.

34:57.762 --> 34:59.305
DONNA:
Is Josh there?

34:59.388 --> 35:00.807
Oh, hi, Noah. How are you?

35:00.890 --> 35:02.809
Hi, Noah. How are you?
Is Josh there?

35:02.892 --> 35:04.685
He's busy.
I need to talk to him.

35:04.769 --> 35:06.354
All right, I'll tell him.

35:06.437 --> 35:07.188
Anything else?

35:07.271 --> 35:10.441
Yeah. I can't believe
you settled.

35:12.610 --> 35:14.153
Withdraw the offer.

35:14.237 --> 35:16.739
What, and put your fate
in the hands of a jury? No way.

35:16.823 --> 35:17.990
I didn't do anything wrong.

35:18.074 --> 35:19.700
{\an1}Forget the Rohypnol--
they could get you

35:19.784 --> 35:21.410
on diminished capacity alone.

35:21.494 --> 35:22.245
"Let me see if

35:22.328 --> 35:24.121
"I've got this straight,
Mr. Hunter.

35:24.205 --> 35:26.541
You thought that
she was drunk?" "Yes."

35:26.624 --> 35:29.210
"You had to help her
up the stairs?" "Yes."

35:29.293 --> 35:31.712
"You knew that she
wasn't feeling well?" "Yes."

35:31.796 --> 35:34.006
"And yet you still
forced yourself upon her.

35:34.090 --> 35:35.174
Is that right?"

35:35.258 --> 35:36.509
{\an3}You're twisting
everything up here.

35:36.592 --> 35:37.844
Oh, you're right,
Noah, and lawyers

35:37.927 --> 35:39.220
{\an1}don't twist things,
do they?

35:40.471 --> 35:43.224
Look, don't let this girl
ruin your life.

35:43.307 --> 35:46.644
She's not worth it.

35:52.775 --> 35:54.277
Tammy said
she was coming right over.

35:54.360 --> 35:56.445
{\an3}Well, if she's got something
to add, we'll add it.

35:56.529 --> 36:00.074
In the meantime, we got to get
this thing proofed and ready.

36:00.157 --> 36:01.450
"Stepping over
the Thin Blue Line."

36:01.534 --> 36:02.618
{\an1}Catchy.
BRANDON: Thank you.

36:02.702 --> 36:04.078
Even if it is unfounded.

36:04.161 --> 36:05.454
{\an3}You didn't even
talk to Glen.

36:05.538 --> 36:08.040
{\an1}I tried. I talked
to some P.R. wag, too.

36:08.124 --> 36:10.251
{\an1}I was sure to include
their "no comment."

36:10.334 --> 36:11.252
(light knocking)

36:11.335 --> 36:12.920
{\an1}STEVE:
Ah, here we go.

36:13.004 --> 36:14.463
What's the story?
We're on a deadline here.

36:14.547 --> 36:16.465
Louie wasn't the guy.

36:16.549 --> 36:18.467
{\an3}What do you mean
he wasn't the guy?

36:18.551 --> 36:19.927
He had a knife,

36:20.011 --> 36:21.262
{\an3}he was in the right place
at the right time,

36:21.345 --> 36:22.847
{\an3}he fit the description,
what're you saying?

36:22.930 --> 36:24.807
Last night another guy was
caught holding up a store,

36:24.891 --> 36:27.226
{\an1}and he confessed
to both robberies.

36:27.310 --> 36:28.269
Was he even stoned?

36:28.352 --> 36:29.770
Blood came back clean.

36:29.854 --> 36:31.272
So what you're saying is,

36:31.355 --> 36:33.274
a completely innocent man
got beat up,

36:33.357 --> 36:35.443
got to spend a complimentary
night in jail

36:35.526 --> 36:37.653
for being in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

36:37.737 --> 36:39.280
The guy was no
Sunday school teacher.

36:39.363 --> 36:40.948
That doesn't excuse
your partner's actions.

36:44.535 --> 36:46.829
About a year ago,
Glen and his old partner,

36:46.913 --> 36:48.456
they were on a routine arrest;

36:48.539 --> 36:50.291
{\an1}just like the other night,
a chronic offender--

36:50.374 --> 36:52.126
only they were a little lax,

36:52.210 --> 36:54.128
and the guy was hopped up.

36:54.211 --> 36:57.423
He shot Glen's partner,
and Glen shot back.

36:57.506 --> 36:59.467
Two dead bodies.

36:59.550 --> 37:01.135
{\an3}So you're saying
a little excessive force

37:01.219 --> 37:02.887
might have saved two lives?

37:02.970 --> 37:05.306
He rode a desk for a long time,
and he got counseling.

37:05.389 --> 37:07.433
Not enough.
He realizes

37:07.516 --> 37:09.602
that now, and he's gonna
get more immediately.

37:11.562 --> 37:12.813
Look, the thing is, is that

37:12.897 --> 37:14.815
he's just a few months away
from retirement,

37:14.899 --> 37:16.317
and your story could
ruin all that.

37:16.400 --> 37:19.654
He was a great cop.

37:19.737 --> 37:21.656
{\an1}STEVE:
Well, you were right.

37:21.739 --> 37:23.741
All the way, Brandon.

37:25.743 --> 37:28.037
I don't think we should go
with the story, though.

37:28.120 --> 37:30.414
(sighs)
Neither do I.

37:31.916 --> 37:33.334
Thank you,

37:33.417 --> 37:35.670
for seeing that things aren't
always what they seem.

37:35.753 --> 37:37.672
Not with Louie.

37:37.755 --> 37:39.131
Not with Glen.

37:39.215 --> 37:41.467
Maybe not even with Valerie.

37:45.596 --> 37:48.557
Maybe.

37:50.810 --> 37:52.311
{\an1}So, you're taking
the settlement?

37:52.395 --> 37:53.521
I didn't say that.

37:53.604 --> 37:55.481
{\an1}Well, you just said
it'd be stupid not to.

37:55.564 --> 37:57.483
{\an3}David...

37:57.566 --> 38:00.861
{\an3}this might be the only
real justice I'm gonna get.

38:00.945 --> 38:02.905
{\an1}Maybe.

38:02.989 --> 38:04.740
You think I'm selling out.
I don't know.

38:04.824 --> 38:06.200
{\an1}You're the victim here,
all right?

38:06.283 --> 38:07.743
{\an1}You have to decide
what'll make it right.

38:07.827 --> 38:09.203
Well, nothing will.

38:09.286 --> 38:11.205
{\an3}But with $200,000,
I don't know--

38:11.288 --> 38:12.748
I could by the After Dark back,

38:12.832 --> 38:14.834
sail around the world,
go to another country.

38:14.917 --> 38:17.503
{\an1}And everyone's gonna think
you made the whole thing up.

38:17.586 --> 38:18.713
Like they don't already do.

38:18.796 --> 38:20.172
(knocking on door)

38:20.256 --> 38:21.424
(sighs)

38:25.970 --> 38:27.263
Jasper, hey.

38:27.346 --> 38:28.222
No pressure or anything,

38:28.306 --> 38:30.558
{\an3}but, um, I just,
I can't help you anymore.

38:30.641 --> 38:33.561
Look, um, now really
isn't a good time.

38:33.644 --> 38:34.937
The record company,

38:35.021 --> 38:36.522
they're gonna drop you.

38:36.605 --> 38:39.608
{\an3}I'm sorry for the
interruption, but, uh,

38:39.692 --> 38:41.360
it's important.

38:41.444 --> 38:43.738
{\an1}(sighs)
No, it-it's okay.

38:43.821 --> 38:45.740
David, you should go.

38:45.823 --> 38:47.742
{\an3}But, Val, I...
Really.

38:47.825 --> 38:50.745
{\an1}I mean thanks to you,
I'm okay.

38:50.828 --> 38:53.372
All right, um,

38:53.456 --> 38:54.415
give me a second, okay?

38:54.498 --> 38:55.791
{\an3}Sure.

38:55.875 --> 38:57.835
Thanks for your help.

38:57.918 --> 39:00.421
Look, are you sure?

39:02.465 --> 39:04.425
David, I have a big
decision to make.

39:04.508 --> 39:06.469
I could use this time alone.

39:06.552 --> 39:08.471
All right.

39:08.554 --> 39:13.017
Um, whatever you decide,
I'll... I'll support you on it.

39:14.018 --> 39:15.478
Thanks.

39:15.561 --> 39:17.146
That means a lot to me.

39:37.833 --> 39:39.293
(knocks)
Hi.

39:39.376 --> 39:41.462
Hi.

39:41.545 --> 39:43.297
What are you doing here?

39:43.380 --> 39:45.800
I want to apologize
for this morning.

39:46.842 --> 39:48.761
I'm just worried about you.

39:48.844 --> 39:50.137
You look exhausted.

39:50.221 --> 39:52.306
Oh, it's tiring
being so bitchy.

39:53.390 --> 39:54.475
I'm sorry.

39:54.558 --> 39:55.810
Don't you have a big

39:55.893 --> 39:57.311
presentation at work to do?

39:57.394 --> 40:00.314
Yeah, don't remind me.

40:00.397 --> 40:02.817
{\an3}Well, can't it
be put off?

40:02.900 --> 40:04.318
Not really.

40:04.402 --> 40:05.319
What are you doing?

40:05.402 --> 40:06.779
Oh, I'm just checking inventory,

40:06.862 --> 40:08.405
and seeing what we need
to reorder.

40:09.406 --> 40:11.450
Do you know if my dad's around?

40:11.534 --> 40:12.576
Yeah, he's in with a patient.

40:12.660 --> 40:14.495
Do you want me to check and see
how long he's gonna be?

40:14.578 --> 40:15.704
Yeah, that'd be great.

40:15.788 --> 40:16.872
Okay, I'll be right back.

40:16.956 --> 40:19.542
Okay.

40:28.968 --> 40:31.011
{\an4}PATIENT:
Do we get them here
at the clinic?

40:31.095 --> 40:33.514
{\an5}DOCTOR:
Yes, I'll prescribe them
for you.

40:33.597 --> 40:34.515
Great.

40:34.598 --> 40:35.683
(indistinct chatter)

41:04.628 --> 41:06.589
He's just gonna be
a few more minutes.

41:06.672 --> 41:08.757
Actually, I can't stick around.

41:08.841 --> 41:09.842
My presentation.

41:09.925 --> 41:11.135
You sure?

41:11.218 --> 41:12.386
Yeah.

41:12.469 --> 41:13.387
{\an1}Is everything okay
with us?

41:13.471 --> 41:14.847
Everything's fine.

41:14.930 --> 41:18.517
Good, then I got
what I came for.

41:18.601 --> 41:19.560
Good luck.

41:19.643 --> 41:21.395
Thanks. Bye.
Bye.

41:33.365 --> 41:35.367
{\an3}Hi.
I'm on my way out.

41:35.451 --> 41:36.911
Uh, you know what?
This is important.

41:36.994 --> 41:39.955
Look, Steve,
if this is about Noah,

41:40.039 --> 41:42.249
{\an3}the D.A., my lawsuit,
the settlement--

41:42.333 --> 41:43.250
save it.

41:43.334 --> 41:44.335
I already know how you feel.

41:44.418 --> 41:45.753
No, you don't.

41:45.836 --> 41:47.546
This ought to be good.

41:47.630 --> 41:50.382
All right, at first, yeah.

41:50.466 --> 41:52.927
I thought you had an angle.
I mean, why not? It fit.

41:53.010 --> 41:55.137
{\an1}There is a pattern to you
after all, Valerie.

41:55.221 --> 41:56.180
Good-bye.

41:56.263 --> 41:57.556
But then I realized that things

41:57.640 --> 42:00.309
aren't always how they seem.

42:00.392 --> 42:02.102
So, man bites dog.

42:02.186 --> 42:03.604
Bad girl gets raped.

42:03.687 --> 42:05.439
I'm still kind of waiting
for the apology.

42:05.522 --> 42:07.775
I jumped to conclusions.

42:07.858 --> 42:08.817
I'm sorry.

42:08.901 --> 42:10.277
So, you think I'm innocent?

42:10.361 --> 42:12.279
I'm gonna keep an open mind.

42:12.363 --> 42:14.114
And I'm supposed to be happy
with that?

42:14.198 --> 42:16.450
Valerie, I'm offering you
an olive branch here.

42:16.533 --> 42:17.785
Yeah, I know, Steve.

42:17.868 --> 42:19.286
It just feels that

42:19.370 --> 42:21.580
if I reach for it,
it's just gonna break.

42:28.754 --> 42:30.798
(bell clanging)

42:35.886 --> 42:37.471
I don't want your money.

42:37.554 --> 42:39.014
Good, 'cause the offer's
withdrawn.

42:39.098 --> 42:40.933
What, you think you can
just buy me off?

42:41.016 --> 42:41.934
I just said there's no offer.

42:42.017 --> 42:43.227
But you made one.

42:43.310 --> 42:44.520
And that just tells me
you know you're guilty.

42:44.603 --> 42:46.438
Once again, Val.

42:46.522 --> 42:48.190
I did not rape you.

42:48.274 --> 42:50.693
Tell it to the judge.
With pleasure.

42:50.776 --> 42:52.403
And by the way if you were
drugged, I didn't notice.

42:52.486 --> 42:55.030
Always such a sensitive lover.

42:55.114 --> 42:56.282
We're both victims here.

42:56.365 --> 42:58.367
No, I'm the one who got rapped!
Not by me.

42:58.450 --> 43:00.160
{\an3}And what do you call sex
without consent, huh?

43:00.244 --> 43:01.495
A mistake.

43:01.578 --> 43:03.497
One that's gonna cost you
dearly.

43:03.580 --> 43:04.331
I thought you weren't in it
for the money.

43:04.415 --> 43:05.332
I'm not.

43:05.416 --> 43:06.333
What, then?

43:06.417 --> 43:07.376
Just you.

43:07.459 --> 43:08.460
On the stand.

43:08.544 --> 43:09.503
Under oath.

43:09.586 --> 43:11.463
So help you God.
