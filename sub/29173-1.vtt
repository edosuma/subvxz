(ENGINE ROARS)

38:15.894 --> 38:17.427
I don't know
what Mum's doing there,

38:17.429 --> 38:18.995
but we're gonna find out.

38:41.653 --> 38:43.353
NED: How many bars you got?

38:43.355 --> 38:44.921
Two.

38:49.027 --> 38:51.094
- (RINGING TONE)
- It's ringing.

38:51.096 --> 38:52.762
LAUREN:<i> Dad?</i>

38:52.764 --> 38:54.364
Where's my car?

38:54.366 --> 38:55.565
<i> What you doing?</i>

38:55.567 --> 38:56.766
Walking your stupid dog.

38:56.768 --> 38:58.435
Don't call Cher stupid, Dad!

38:58.437 --> 38:59.736
Dad, just listen carefully,

38:59.738 --> 39:01.471
because I can't believe
I'm asking you this...

39:01.473 --> 39:03.973
- Where's my car?
<i> - We have your stupid car.</i>

39:03.975 --> 39:05.475
Don't call her stupid!

39:05.477 --> 39:08.378
Dad, listen. I need you
to plan the wedding.

39:08.380 --> 39:09.646
Hey, sorry, can we
take a photo?

39:09.648 --> 39:11.748
- So cute!
- Uh, yeah, sure! (LAUGHS)

39:11.750 --> 39:14.718
No, no, no, the whole wedding.

39:14.720 --> 39:17.053
<i> Venue, celebrant, flowers,</i>
<i> candles, canapés.</i>

39:17.055 --> 39:18.521
<i> Bloody everything.</i>

39:18.523 --> 39:20.457
- Perfect. So cute.
- Thanks for that.

39:20.459 --> 39:22.092
Yeah, no. No worries, love.

39:22.094 --> 39:23.893
<i> Dad, are you listening?</i>

39:23.895 --> 39:26.396
God willing we find Mum tonight
and you're off the hook, but...

39:26.398 --> 39:28.431
What, you found her?
Wh-where are you?

39:28.433 --> 39:29.766
No, no, no, Dad. It's...

39:29.768 --> 39:31.468
How'd she look? Is she OK?

39:31.470 --> 39:34.504
<i> She's fine. We haven't</i>
<i>found her yet, but we're close.</i>

39:34.506 --> 39:35.672
I'm coming.

39:35.674 --> 39:38.041
No, Dad! Just...

39:38.043 --> 39:40.110
I need you there, OK?

39:40.112 --> 39:43.012
If she sees me
and hears about the wedding,

39:43.014 --> 39:45.515
maybe she'll put this whole
romantic adventure behind her.

39:45.517 --> 39:47.150
- Romantic?
- Shh! Don't say...

39:47.152 --> 39:49.552
<i> - Who's she there with?</i>
- No-one.

39:49.554 --> 39:51.821
Yeah, I'll bet it's
that personal trainer Hugo.

39:51.823 --> 39:53.923
She's been training with that
poser for the last six months.

39:53.925 --> 39:55.091
Hasn't lost a pound.

39:55.093 --> 39:56.526
She's not with Hugo, Dad.

39:56.527 --> 39:57.960
<i> Then what's so romantic</i>
<i> about it?</i>

39:57.963 --> 39:59.562
She's alone.

40:00.766 --> 40:03.666
<i> Dad, I need you now, OK?</i>

40:03.668 --> 40:06.703
<i> I'll find Mum,</i>
<i> you organise the wedding.</i>

40:06.705 --> 40:09.773
<i> Dad, are you listening? Dad!</i>

40:11.476 --> 40:13.843
It's time to send in
the big gun.

Have I got the right place?

41:05.497 --> 41:09.666
Are Ronelle, Dana
and, uh, Kailah here yet?

41:09.668 --> 41:12.936
Oh...I don't think so. Why?

41:12.938 --> 41:15.038
Your daughter made my firm
a lot of money

41:15.040 --> 41:17.207
in the last quarter,
and I do not intend to lose her

41:17.209 --> 41:19.909
to some 'no place like home'
la-la fantasy.

41:19.911 --> 41:22.212
She's put me in charge
of this event

41:22.214 --> 41:24.948
and I intend to take charge.

41:24.950 --> 41:28.218
Now, I am no wedding planner,

41:28.220 --> 41:30.487
but I am a planner.

41:30.489 --> 41:32.121
So let's hop to it.

41:33.558 --> 41:35.024
Eh?

(CALLS OUT) Ned?

42:22.841 --> 42:24.607
Is your name Lauren?

42:27.145 --> 42:28.878
Hop in.

43:23.802 --> 43:26.669
Good morning, almost wife.

43:26.671 --> 43:29.305
Good morning, almost husband.

43:31.676 --> 43:33.076
Is that eggs Benedict?

43:33.078 --> 43:35.979
Your favourite, right?

43:35.981 --> 43:39.248
I found all this camping gear
under the car seats.

43:40.785 --> 43:42.352
Shall we?

43:46.625 --> 43:48.191
Listen, um...

43:49.294 --> 43:50.994
Before we left home, uh,

43:50.996 --> 43:54.263
this little thing happened
at work and, um...

43:54.265 --> 43:57.000
Oh, my God!
It's like a restaurant!

43:57.002 --> 43:58.735
Really?

43:58.737 --> 44:00.303
Oh, great.

44:07.379 --> 44:09.145
Thank you.

44:11.082 --> 44:12.849
Come on, then.

44:15.120 --> 44:16.686
Bon appétit.

44:16.688 --> 44:18.321
Mm-hm.

44:21.726 --> 44:22.892
Cake!

44:22.894 --> 44:24.093
Yes!

44:24.095 --> 44:26.129

That's too easy!

44:26.131 --> 44:28.731
Yeah, one trip to the Cheesecake
Shop. That's it, done.

44:28.733 --> 44:31.334
Excuse me! Do either of you
know how to make a cake?

44:31.336 --> 44:33.036
Yeah, like you're gonna
make it yourself.

44:33.038 --> 44:35.772
No debate, ladies! Next.

44:38.376 --> 44:41.711
Flowers?! I don't know anything
about bloody flowers!

44:41.713 --> 44:43.146
Here. Give me cake.

44:43.148 --> 44:44.447
Sure. I'll do flowers!

Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh!
No swapping. Next.

44:54.893 --> 44:57.427
- Decorations.
- HAMPTON: Perfect.

45:00.331 --> 45:03.733
That is enough, ladies.

45:03.735 --> 45:05.268
I'm doing cake!

45:05.270 --> 45:07.303
You wouldn't know wedding cake
if it landed between your legs!

45:07.305 --> 45:09.706
At least I got things
landing between my legs!

45:09.708 --> 45:11.007
Oh, yeah, what, Rodney Roberts?

45:11.009 --> 45:12.475
- That's a bit crusty.
- No! Rodney Roberts?

45:40.805 --> 45:44.407
School camp.
Year eight or something.

45:44.409 --> 45:47.210
I remember because one of
the Jawoyn rangers taught us

45:47.212 --> 45:49.145
the local word for
'saltwater crocodile'

45:49.147 --> 45:50.747
and then this boy yells out,

45:50.749 --> 45:53.449
"Hey, Lauren, why don't<i> you</i>
speak Aboriginal?"

45:53.451 --> 45:55.785

45:55.787 --> 45:58.788

so bad.

46:00.225 --> 46:03.860
But then I realised it wasn't
the boy I was angry with.

46:03.862 --> 46:06.362
It was the fact
I didn't know the answer.

46:08.967 --> 46:11.834
I don't know why my mum
didn't want to teach me Tiwi.

46:14.205 --> 46:16.339
I don't want to do that
to our kids.

how to avoid it.

OK? She gave it to us.

47:32.851 --> 47:34.116
Why would she do that?

47:34.118 --> 47:36.018
Because she was
a lot more chill than you.

she's never smoked pot before.

not to share it with her, so...

with my mother?

so full of smoke,

a smoking ceremony inside.

48:38.683 --> 48:41.017
Before I open my door,

48:41.019 --> 48:43.019
a couple of backpackers
make a run for it

48:43.021 --> 48:44.253
straight into the bush.

48:44.255 --> 48:46.222
I couldn't be arsed
chasing them,

48:46.224 --> 48:49.659
so I take a peek
inside their car and...

48:49.661 --> 48:52.128
..ooh, I nearly fell over
from shock!

getting all Bob Marley and shit.

- Yeah, yeah, I know.

- So why did you arrest her?
- Oh, come on, cuz.

49:02.140 --> 49:04.106
Had your mum yelling at me
all morning.

49:04.108 --> 49:05.408
I was just doing my job.

49:05.410 --> 49:07.944
OK, can you just hurry up
so we can see her?

49:07.946 --> 49:09.478
I didn't bloody book her. Nah.

49:09.480 --> 49:11.080
Just locked her up
till she was sober,

49:11.082 --> 49:12.581
copped a lecture
and set her loose.

49:12.583 --> 49:15.551
(BOTH GROAN)

49:15.553 --> 49:17.153
You right, cuz?

49:17.989 --> 49:19.288
She right?

49:20.959 --> 49:24.560
Officer, do you have
a detective in the building?

49:24.562 --> 49:26.595
Um...

49:26.597 --> 49:28.197
Cheeky Wendy sometimes pops in.

49:28.199 --> 49:30.733
Yeah, we're gonna need
to speak to a detective asap.

49:30.735 --> 49:32.368
- Huh?
- Huh?

49:32.370 --> 49:34.103
As I'm sure you're aware,
in the District Court,

49:34.105 --> 49:35.371
a drug trafficking offence...

49:35.373 --> 49:36.605
It was just a little fella.

49:36.607 --> 49:39.342
..could inflict a penalty
of $200,000.

49:39.344 --> 49:40.443
- Whoa, whoa!
- Wait a second!

49:40.445 --> 49:42.745
- Or 15 years in prison.
- Ned!

49:42.747 --> 49:44.714
Go ahead.

49:44.716 --> 49:46.148
Look it up on your computer.

49:46.150 --> 49:48.017
LAUREN: What are you doing?

49:48.019 --> 49:50.152
We're gonna need all your team
working on the case,

49:50.154 --> 49:52.321
and don't make me lodge a 25A.

49:52.323 --> 49:55.391
We all know how tedious that
paperwork can get. Am I right?

49:56.361 --> 49:58.127
So...

49:59.030 --> 50:00.696
..what you're saying is...

50:02.000 --> 50:03.232
..you want us to find her?

50:03.234 --> 50:04.433
- Yes.
- Can you?

50:04.435 --> 50:05.701
But she not even lost.

50:05.703 --> 50:08.137
- What?
- Mum picked her up.

50:08.139 --> 50:09.572
Great!

50:09.574 --> 50:12.141
That's...that's good, isn't it?

50:12.143 --> 50:13.642
Braydon's mum,
she's kind of a...

50:13.644 --> 50:15.077
Pain in the arse.

50:15.079 --> 50:17.413
OK. But maybe
they're still together.

50:17.415 --> 50:19.048
Where do we find your mum?

50:19.050 --> 50:21.083
(LAUGHS)

50:21.686 --> 50:23.652
She gone fishin'.

50:23.654 --> 50:25.721

with that Frenchie.

50:25.723 --> 50:27.456
He bats for the other side!

50:27.458 --> 50:29.792
Auntie, come on!
How was I meant to know?

50:29.794 --> 50:32.028
AUNTIE: Well,
the whole Top End knows!

50:32.030 --> 50:33.396
LAUREN: (GROANS) Yeah, alright.

50:33.398 --> 50:35.131
So, tell me, then,
where is she?

50:35.133 --> 50:36.399
Don't humbug me with questions

50:36.401 --> 50:38.534
when you already know
the answer.

50:38.536 --> 50:41.270
If I knew the answer, I wouldn't
be on a wild goose chase.

50:41.272 --> 50:42.571
Wild goose?

50:42.573 --> 50:44.507
Don't you mean jungle fowl?

50:44.509 --> 50:46.175
Huh?

50:46.177 --> 50:47.810
AUNTIE: That's one of
your dances, girl.

50:47.812 --> 50:49.545
Now, sit down and have a cuppa.

50:49.547 --> 50:52.148
- No tea. I just want...
- Did you say milk or sugar?

50:52.150 --> 50:54.050
LAUREN: Neither.
Please, just tell me straight.

50:54.052 --> 50:55.184
Uh, Lauren?

50:55.186 --> 50:56.719
When you dropped her
at the bus,

50:56.721 --> 50:58.587
did she say
where she was going?

50:58.589 --> 51:00.122
Of course.

51:00.124 --> 51:01.624
Well, why don't you just tell me
where she went?

51:01.626 --> 51:03.225
- I can.
- Thank you.

51:03.227 --> 51:04.293
But I won't.

51:04.295 --> 51:06.095
Oh, Jesus!

51:06.097 --> 51:08.497
He can't help. Nah.

51:12.203 --> 51:14.236
Where do<i> you</i> go
to mend a broken heart?

51:14.238 --> 51:15.638
The doctor?

51:15.640 --> 51:17.773
Is she always like this?

51:21.813 --> 51:26.082
When my boy's had a rough day
locking up them wild ones

51:26.084 --> 51:28.584
and hurting real bad,
what does he do?

51:30.688 --> 51:33.689
He comes here to Mummy one.

51:33.691 --> 51:36.158
Fill his belly with a big feed.

51:36.160 --> 51:37.760
He's happy boy.

51:39.430 --> 51:41.831
When you're hurting,

51:41.833 --> 51:43.766
where do you go looking?

51:45.303 --> 51:46.635
For Mum.

51:46.637 --> 51:48.337
Ah.

51:48.339 --> 51:50.406
And your Mummy one?

51:50.408 --> 51:52.174
When she hurt?

51:53.578 --> 51:57.113
I'm sorry, what?
Where's your mum now?

52:03.821 --> 52:05.588
Tiwi.

52:11.162 --> 52:13.696
(WOMEN CHATTER IN BACKGROUND)

52:13.698 --> 52:16.198
- Should I be touching this?
- Take it off!

52:16.200 --> 52:18.167
Hey, no need to snatch!

52:19.403 --> 52:21.370
Hey, Unc.

52:21.372 --> 52:22.872
Sounds like old times.

52:22.874 --> 52:24.607
Bet you're glad those are over.

52:24.609 --> 52:27.376
I'd take 'em back
in a heartbeat.

52:30.748 --> 52:33.616
You know, I probably shouldn't
be talking about this stuff

52:33.618 --> 52:35.251
with you, Uncle,

52:35.253 --> 52:37.820
but ever since my kids' dad
ran off with that skank,

52:37.822 --> 52:40.789
I haven't exactly had much luck
with<i> muligahs.</i>

52:40.791 --> 52:42.758
That is until I went
to a friend's wedding

52:42.760 --> 52:44.226
a few months back

52:44.228 --> 52:46.829
and I met this<i> budju</i> of a man.

52:46.831 --> 52:49.298
And I'm telling you,
we had a night

52:49.300 --> 52:51.400
that started off
like a Disney movie

52:51.402 --> 52:54.270
and ended like a XXX...

52:54.272 --> 52:56.405
Ronelle!

52:56.407 --> 52:59.575
My point is,
weddings change people.

52:59.577 --> 53:01.277
Not just the bride and groom.

53:01.279 --> 53:03.479
We make this wedding
as romantic as possible

53:03.481 --> 53:04.880
and you'll get Auntie back.

53:04.882 --> 53:06.715

Oi, you mob! Shut your holes
and get your rings in the car!

53:10.521 --> 53:12.388
You want me to check your Keno?

53:12.390 --> 53:13.689
No.

53:13.691 --> 53:15.524

<i> you're</i> moaning about.

- Here, are you driving?

53:17.395 --> 53:19.828
Excuse me? We got a wedding
to put together.

53:19.830 --> 53:21.297
Yes, we know.

53:21.299 --> 53:22.698
Yeah, and people are
trying to sleep.

53:22.700 --> 53:24.400
People should be up by now.

53:24.402 --> 53:26.335
If they're not up by now,
they're wasting their lives.

53:26.337 --> 53:27.670
Oh, rightio, Mum!

53:27.672 --> 53:29.405
OK, big shot, let's not
waste our lives away.

53:29.407 --> 53:31.207
- Where to first?
- We gotta go Casuarina.

53:31.209 --> 53:32.675
Then we gotta go out
to Winnellie.

53:32.677 --> 53:34.276
Then we have to go
Mindil Beach markets.

Yeah.

wrong with you?

58:12.890 --> 58:14.656

58:14.658 --> 58:16.225
What does that even mean?

58:18.262 --> 58:20.128
Stop. Wait.

58:20.130 --> 58:21.930
You've been lying to me
this whole time.

58:21.932 --> 58:23.665
I haven't lied.
I just haven't found...

58:23.667 --> 58:25.634
You can't drop a bomb like that
without telling me first!

I can't believe we did this
all in a day.

58:43.120 --> 58:45.654
Like I said, planning is
the bedrock of success.

58:45.656 --> 58:47.222
I should put this cake
in the fridge.

- We should pop a champers.
- OTHERS: No.

- Yeah, we'll do it.
- Leave it to us.

she had to hide the heel,

probably in a croissant.

like her mum. (CHUCKLES)

59:28.699 --> 59:30.299
Tell me about her.

59:30.301 --> 59:32.734
- Who?
- Your wife.

59:37.675 --> 59:40.142
Some people say that they
didn't see a divorce coming,

59:40.144 --> 59:43.011
but...surely
there must be signs.

59:43.013 --> 59:44.880
We're not divorced.

59:44.882 --> 59:47.182
Oh, I'm s...I'm sorry. Oh.

59:48.586 --> 59:51.019
Oh, it's none of my business.
I'm s...

59:53.257 --> 59:55.357
When Daf and I
first got together,

59:55.359 --> 59:57.693
it was at the expense
of certain...

59:58.362 --> 1:00:00.228
..well, certain traditions.

1:00:00.230 --> 1:00:04.099
She became convinced that
her family hated us for it.

1:00:04.101 --> 1:00:08.704
All that got brushed aside
while we raised Lauren.

1:00:08.706 --> 1:00:11.206
But it's funny how quickly
the years can pass.

1:00:11.208 --> 1:00:15.344

alone again in the house.

1:00:15.346 --> 1:00:17.179

1:00:20.117 --> 1:00:21.717
I mean...

1:00:21.719 --> 1:00:24.052
You know, there was talk
in the house.

1:00:25.089 --> 1:00:26.855
Just no listening.

1:00:28.659 --> 1:00:30.826
And eventually,
there wasn't even talk.

1:00:35.399 --> 1:00:38.767
- (BOTH CHUCKLE)
- Sorry.

1:00:38.769 --> 1:00:40.335

Oh! (SIGHS) It's still hot.

1:00:43.173 --> 1:00:45.707
Yeah, yeah.

1:00:45.709 --> 1:00:47.376
What about you?

1:00:47.378 --> 1:00:49.011
No, we won't talk about me.

1:00:49.013 --> 1:00:50.912
Aw! That ain't fair.

1:00:52.683 --> 1:00:55.350
Uh, there was a guy, once,
and we were engaged.

1:00:55.352 --> 1:00:57.319
But it doesn't matter.

1:00:57.321 --> 1:00:59.087
Well, and?

1:01:02.926 --> 1:01:05.193
The, uh, lawyer in me...

1:01:07.231 --> 1:01:10.732
..asked him to sign a, uh...

1:01:10.734 --> 1:01:12.734
..prenuptial agreement.

1:01:12.736 --> 1:01:17.673
He felt that was a sign that
I didn't trust him completely.

1:01:19.243 --> 1:01:21.243
And that was it.
It was all over.

1:01:22.446 --> 1:01:24.312
I threw myself into my work.

1:01:25.249 --> 1:01:26.748
Did you trust him?

1:01:26.750 --> 1:01:28.417
Completely.

1:01:32.956 --> 1:01:35.824
I think it was me
I didn't trust.

1:01:51.108 --> 1:01:52.874
You're right.

1:01:54.344 --> 1:01:56.278
I should have told you
about the job.

1:01:56.280 --> 1:01:57.913
But you know what?

1:01:57.915 --> 1:02:00.348
It might feel like me quitting
came out of nowhere,

1:02:00.350 --> 1:02:02.117
but it didn't.

1:02:03.153 --> 1:02:04.953
You just never noticed.

1:02:06.156 --> 1:02:08.757
You get so wrapped up
in other things.

1:02:08.759 --> 1:02:11.293
Back home, it's your job,
now it's your family...

1:02:11.295 --> 1:02:14.796
If I'm so self-absorbed,
why do you want to marry me?

1:02:14.798 --> 1:02:17.032
- Oh come on, Lauren.
- That's not an answer.

1:02:17.034 --> 1:02:18.734
Because you're<i> not</i>
self-absorbed, OK?

1:02:18.736 --> 1:02:19.968
You're dedicated.

1:02:19.970 --> 1:02:21.803
All I'm saying is
that you could point

1:02:21.805 --> 1:02:23.438
some of that dedication
this way.

1:02:30.314 --> 1:02:33.048
