01:04.263 --> 01:08.810
It may be best to start recalling the origin of this word.

01:09.020 --> 01:11.104
In Greek, "photo" meaning light.

01:11.229 --> 01:15.233
And "graphein" was writing, drawing.

01:15.359 --> 01:19.696
A photographer is literally someone drawing with light.

01:19.906 --> 01:24.743
Someone who writes and rewrites the world with light and shadow.

01:44.432 --> 01:47.392
Sierra Pelada, la pray Mine Brazil,

01:47.518 --> 01:49.061
in front of me.

01:50.980 --> 01:54.858
When I reached the edge of that huge hole

01:55.986 --> 01:58.195
I raised the hair.

01:58.321 --> 02:02.490
I had never seen anything like it.

02:03.953 --> 02:07.997
There, I saw before me in a split second,

02:08.122 --> 02:09.997
the history of mankind.

02:10.501 --> 02:13.002
The history of the construction of the pyramids,

02:13.380 --> 02:15.170
the Tower of Babel,

02:15.298 --> 02:17.174
King Solomon's Mines.

02:17.842 --> 02:21.637
The sound of a single machine in there was no sound.

02:22.681 --> 02:24.389
Only you could hear

02:25.100 --> 02:30.105
the murmur of 50,000 people in a big hole.

02:32.440 --> 02:34.900
Conversations, noise, human noise

02:35.027 --> 02:37.945
mixed with touches manuals ...

02:39.281 --> 02:41.950
Actually, I have traveled to the beginning of time there.

02:43.536 --> 02:47.706
I could almost hear the murmur of gold in those souls.

03:01.680 --> 03:03.930
We had to throw all that land.

03:04.183 --> 03:05.725
Not everything is gold,

03:05.851 --> 03:09.938
They had to climb, get out, climb the small stairs

03:10.064 --> 03:12.274
then get to the big stairs,

03:12.400 --> 03:14.026
and come to the surface.

03:25.455 --> 03:27.998
You're not thinking of falling.

03:30.628 --> 03:34.382
And if you fall, there is a risk you take several.

03:37.386 --> 03:40.179
I up several times a day

03:40.305 --> 03:42.640
and it never occurred to me that I might fall

03:42.766 --> 03:45.100
because no one fell.

03:45.226 --> 03:49.897
We were there to carry bags or to take pictures, in my case.

03:56.239 --> 03:59.991
The men went up there 50 or 60 times a day.

04:02.995 --> 04:06.708
The only way down an inclined plane like that

04:06.834 --> 04:08.333
He is running.

04:08.543 --> 04:11.253
Si paras, te caes.

04:20.307 --> 04:24.892
All these people together formed a very organized world.

04:25.018 --> 04:27.396
But completely crazy.

04:40.828 --> 04:44.122
They may look like slaves,

04:44.498 --> 04:46.666
but there was not a single slave.

04:46.792 --> 04:50.920
If there was slavery there, it was the desire to be rich.

04:51.632 --> 04:53.590
Everyone wanted to be rich.

04:55.552 --> 05:00.931
There you could find everything: intellectuals, lawyers,

05:01.057 --> 05:03.976
Farm employees,

05:04.102 --> 05:06.561
City workers ...

05:06.687 --> 05:10.109
They all came to look for an opportunity.

05:12.111 --> 05:16.282
Because when we gave a gold mine,

05:16.823 --> 05:21.495
everyone working in that part of the mine

05:21.746 --> 05:24.623
They had the right to choose a bag.

05:25.249 --> 05:28.085
And in those sacks they had chosen

05:28.211 --> 05:30.129
slavery was hiding.

05:30.255 --> 05:34.341
It could be nothing or could be a kilo of gold.

05:35.302 --> 05:38.638
At that time they played their independence.

05:40.933 --> 05:44.437
All men, when they begin to touch the gold,

05:44.563 --> 05:46.189
They do not return.

05:56.866 --> 06:00.203
I saw this picture for the first time in a gallery,

06:00.329 --> 06:02.538
more than twenty years ago.

06:02.664 --> 06:04.873
I did not know who had taken.

06:05.292 --> 06:10.630
I thought, "He must be a great photographer and an adventurer."

06:11.507 --> 06:13.883
Behind it was a stamp and a signature.

06:14.009 --> 06:16.344
Sebastião Salgado.

06:16.805 --> 06:18.889
I bought a copy.

06:20.100 --> 06:24.979
The gallery drawer pulled more photos of the same photographer.

06:25.230 --> 06:28.107
What I saw moved me deeply,

06:28.234 --> 06:30.693
especially this image,

06:30.944 --> 06:34.281
portrait of a blind woman Tuareg.

06:36.158 --> 06:39.578
Even though tears cause I see every day,

06:39.704 --> 06:42.874
So since then, it hangs on my desk.

06:43.416 --> 06:47.754
I knew something of Sebastião Salgado.

06:47.880 --> 06:50.256
Really they cared about people.

06:50.715 --> 06:53.051
This meant a lot to me.

06:53.636 --> 06:57.556
At the end of the day, people are the salt of the earth.

06:59.517 --> 07:02.895
It was a long time before we met

07:03.521 --> 07:07.525
and we talked about his life, his work and where it came from everything.

07:13.823 --> 07:18.452
The salt of the earth

07:42.020 --> 07:46.983
We can put many photographers in one place,

07:47.109 --> 07:49.985
always will draw very different pictures

07:51.071 --> 07:54.157
because necessarily come

07:55.159 --> 07:59.038
very very different sites.

07:59.872 --> 08:02.708
Everyone has their way of seeing,

08:04.044 --> 08:07.046
each according to his story.

08:09.050 --> 08:10.175
I think my story

08:11.551 --> 08:16.223
It is that I learned my way to see here in this place.

08:17.808 --> 08:19.892
Here I have an ideal world.

08:21.813 --> 08:24.773
Took long walks with my father,

08:25.023 --> 08:28.902
through this place, and we came here to watch.

08:33.116 --> 08:35.159
Behind each of these mountains,

08:35.910 --> 08:38.371
there is a story, there is something to see.

08:47.089 --> 08:48.507
Here I dreamed a lot.

08:50.135 --> 08:53.387
He wanted to go beyond these mountains, he wanted to know.

09:03.315 --> 09:06.776
A JOURNEY WITH Sebastiao Salgado

09:40.814 --> 09:45.943
MOUNTAINS OF WEST PAPUA, INDONESIA, Village Yali, 2011

13:20.464 --> 13:25.385
Sebastião was very bohemian, was always traveling.

13:26.137 --> 13:27.900
He liked to travel as anyone.

13:27.935 --> 13:29.181
My father was like that.

13:29.390 --> 13:34.437
It was not anywhere. It was like a shuttle.

13:35.521 --> 13:37.147
That was Tiao.

13:37.273 --> 13:39.901
I thought I was in Vitoria, and was here.

13:40.026 --> 13:44.529
O he was in the north, or making political propaganda.

13:45.448 --> 13:46.282
And as for studies,

13:46.407 --> 13:49.617
if I had not had friends, he would have studied.

13:51.747 --> 13:56.417
Sebastião was left for studies. He gave a lot of work.

13:56.544 --> 13:58.587
But he studied economics.

14:00.424 --> 14:02.467
I wanted to do law.

14:02.502 --> 14:04.510
He studied one year, but did not like

14:05.721 --> 14:09.264
and he switched to economics, and did well.

14:12.685 --> 14:14.061
This was Sebastião Salgado,

14:14.188 --> 14:16.355
Father.

14:16.898 --> 14:19.609
He bequeathed his name to his only son,

14:19.735 --> 14:23.821
who, though he remained all his life a restless traveler,

14:23.948 --> 14:28.118
He benefited from studies that his father forced him to take

14:28.620 --> 14:32.122
in ways that would never have imagined.

14:32.499 --> 14:37.336
His studies in Economics endowed him sound knowledge

14:37.462 --> 14:40.756
markets, trade and industry.

14:40.883 --> 14:43.842
So I knew what ruled the world.

14:45.137 --> 14:50.518
For him, all started in Aimorés, a small town in Brazil.

14:51.395 --> 14:54.813
There the estate of his father stood under the big sky.

14:54.938 --> 14:57.650
There were vast Atlantic forests.

14:57.775 --> 15:01.070
The river then was still navigable.

15:01.570 --> 15:05.283
But above all, endless trains were passing by

15:05.659 --> 15:08.913
bursting with minerals, iron ore

15:09.039 --> 15:11.748
going from there to the rest of the world.

15:12.291 --> 15:17.045
At the end of the day, this was and still is the largest mining area in the world.

15:18.088 --> 15:23.093
That's where Sebastião grew. He was the only child among seven sisters.

15:23.429 --> 15:24.554
What a life!

15:26.181 --> 15:27.264
Every summer,

15:27.391 --> 15:32.102
He played on the banks of the Rio Doce, the "sweet river".

15:32.229 --> 15:34.314
That's where we are.

15:34.440 --> 15:35.773
So here we are,

15:35.900 --> 15:38.234
our small crew.

15:38.569 --> 15:39.985
Sebastian, ¿te ahí falls?

15:40.113 --> 15:42.197
I learned one thing.

15:42.948 --> 15:45.659
Having a photographer in front of my camera

15:45.785 --> 15:48.745
It is very different from shooting anyone else.

15:48.872 --> 15:52.498
Not standing still doing himself.

15:52.960 --> 15:57.714
No. For professional bias, react and respond

15:58.048 --> 16:00.967
using his weapon, his camera.

16:01.552 --> 16:03.303
Returns the shot.

16:03.429 --> 16:07.558
- Wim, I have a very nice picture of you. - I will not say it.

16:07.684 --> 16:09.058
I can imagine!

16:09.352 --> 16:12.396
In this case, it was not just me ... fotografiándome

16:12.522 --> 16:13.356
Look at the picture.

16:13.606 --> 16:16.234
Two of us had on target.

16:16.359 --> 16:20.028
The other, my fellow director, was his eldest son, Julian.

16:20.530 --> 16:25.034
He had already accompanied his father with his camera on several trips,

16:25.160 --> 16:29.081
as Papua New Guinea, who have already seen.

16:29.206 --> 16:34.503
Or here, to a remote island north of the East Siberian Sea.

16:34.629 --> 16:37.130
I wish I could join them.

16:46.600 --> 16:51.646
Father and son Salgado invited me to continue this documentary with them,

16:51.772 --> 16:54.399
I guess to add an external view of your adventure.

16:55.484 --> 16:57.361
I did not hesitate for a second.

16:57.487 --> 16:59.945
What more could you ask for?

17:01.072 --> 17:03.574
At last I could get to know this man,

17:03.700 --> 17:05.994
discover what motivated him

17:06.121 --> 17:09.873
and why his work had impressed me so much.

17:10.542 --> 17:15.046
I did not know I was going to discover

17:15.172 --> 17:17.298
much more than a photographer.

17:22.095 --> 17:24.056
Sebastião was 15

17:24.182 --> 17:27.685
when he took the train and went to the small town forever

17:27.810 --> 17:31.313
to attend school in the provincial capital of Vitoria.

17:31.815 --> 17:36.151
So young, at first did not know what to do with money in their pockets.

17:36.278 --> 17:39.154
I had never paid any money.

17:39.280 --> 17:41.991
On the farm, which produced all of them.

17:42.116 --> 17:44.952
So, at first, starved,

17:45.079 --> 17:48.456
dreading going to a store to order something to eat.

17:51.877 --> 17:55.213
Ignorant of what had become of Sebastião

17:55.340 --> 17:58.675
He had not appeared this girl in your life.

17:58.802 --> 18:00.052
Lelia.

18:00.596 --> 18:04.181
I was 17, I was studying music and incredibly beautiful.

18:04.307 --> 18:06.432
It was love at first sight.

18:06.559 --> 18:08.435
When Sebastião won a scholarship

18:08.771 --> 18:11.814
to study for a Master in Economics from the University of Sao Paulo

18:12.065 --> 18:14.485
they moved there and married.

18:17.196 --> 18:18.530
It was the 60,

18:18.656 --> 18:21.283
both they involved in left-wing movements,

18:21.409 --> 18:25.161
as other students in Paris, Berlin or Chicago.

18:25.747 --> 18:29.125
Brazil was under the rule of a brutal military dictatorship,

18:29.250 --> 18:33.586
thus, the risk of being arrested, deported and tortured was constant.

18:35.925 --> 18:38.092
In August 1969,

18:38.718 --> 18:41.263
Sebastian y su Lelia if marcharon of homeland

18:41.389 --> 18:43.431
and they took a boat to France.

18:45.393 --> 18:48.478
Sebastião while continuing his training as an economist,

18:48.688 --> 18:51.148
Lélia studying architecture.

18:51.273 --> 18:55.027
A memorable day, she bought a camera for their work.

18:55.153 --> 18:58.489
And we really had fun with her was Sebastião.

18:58.615 --> 19:02.522
The first photograph was taken Lélia, of course.

19:03.329 --> 19:07.790
Sebastião entered the International Coffee Organization

19:07.916 --> 19:09.251
and they moved to London.

19:09.376 --> 19:11.795
With the idea of ​​a career in the World Bank,

19:12.172 --> 19:16.258
often he traveled to Africa to study development projects.

19:16.384 --> 19:18.302
Lélia's camera was taking

19:18.929 --> 19:22.097
and always he returned with many pictures.

19:23.683 --> 19:25.685
Realizing that those pictures

19:25.812 --> 19:29.563
They met him much more than economic reports,

19:29.815 --> 19:32.942
both took a bold decision.

19:33.194 --> 19:35.153
He had to take the enormous risk

19:35.947 --> 19:40.158
to abandon his promising career as an economist

19:40.453 --> 19:42.328
to start from scratch.

19:43.204 --> 19:47.916
They returned to Paris and spent all photographic equipment cost.

19:48.919 --> 19:52.629
For a time, Sebastião tried photographing sports,

19:52.756 --> 19:56.051
made portraits, weddings and even naked,

19:56.177 --> 19:58.678
before finding his calling.

20:03.683 --> 20:05.769
Those are my first photos.

20:05.895 --> 20:08.981
We were in Tahoua.

20:09.774 --> 20:12.359
Two young mothers queuing

20:12.694 --> 20:15.780
to receive food.

20:15.906 --> 20:21.035
It was a time of great drought in Niger, 1973.

20:21.620 --> 20:26.165
For Lelia was more difficult because she was pregnant.

20:26.292 --> 20:29.669
I remember once we were there,

20:30.087 --> 20:33.923
in a friend's house in Niamey.

20:34.175 --> 20:36.968
Then came the marabout of Niamey.

20:37.095 --> 20:41.473
Lélia was wearing shorts, she was gorgeous.

20:42.350 --> 20:45.727
And the marabout came, sat down,

20:45.855 --> 20:47.813
and said Lelia.

20:47.940 --> 20:50.316
"Come out, sit on my lap."

20:51.443 --> 20:53.278
"Oh," I said,

20:53.404 --> 20:57.366
"Marabout sir, there is a small problem,

20:57.493 --> 21:01.202
this woman is pregnant

21:01.830 --> 21:03.539
our first child.

21:03.665 --> 21:06.833
You better stay here. "

21:06.959 --> 21:10.838
He understood the need ...

21:12.925 --> 21:16.343
the lack of synchronization at that time.

21:16.594 --> 21:19.931
And finally, we talked so much that it was a kilo of sugar,

21:20.058 --> 21:22.767
as happy as if he had gone with Lelia.

21:27.732 --> 21:32.194
His son Julian was born in Paris in 1974.

21:32.445 --> 21:35.656
There's my future colleague and co-director.

21:36.490 --> 21:41.162
Lélia continued to support Sebastião around as a young mother.

21:41.413 --> 21:43.415
He worked hard in their studies

21:43.540 --> 21:46.668
and to present the work of Sebastião everywhere.

21:46.794 --> 21:50.004
In magazines, newspapers and agencies.

21:50.382 --> 21:51.130
And so,

21:51.633 --> 21:54.259
after some relevant publications,

21:54.803 --> 22:00.266
both they found the courage to conceive her first major photographic project.

22:00.976 --> 22:04.813
"Other Americas".

22:05.688 --> 22:09.692
It would take Sebastião throughout South America.

22:10.152 --> 22:11.820
The small Juliano got used

22:11.946 --> 22:15.531
the long absences of her father.

22:17.785 --> 22:21.455
OTHER AMERICAS

22:22.833 --> 22:26.794
After leaving Brazil in 1969,

22:26.920 --> 22:30.923
I started to really miss Latin America.

22:31.300 --> 22:33.800
And I decided to make a trip

22:33.927 --> 22:36.180
to neighboring Brazil.

22:36.306 --> 22:40.184
Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia ...

22:40.477 --> 22:45.313
Also it sounded to see mountains of Latin America.

22:45.440 --> 22:47.024
The Andes.

22:48.109 --> 22:53.406
At that time, Latin America, there was a profound social upheaval.

22:53.866 --> 22:56.491
Theology of Liberation.

22:57.745 --> 23:02.415
On that trip I met a young priest in Ecuador,

23:02.667 --> 23:04.458
Gabicho named.

23:04.585 --> 23:09.047
We fear the same age, a young photographer and a young priest.

23:09.298 --> 23:12.009
He was the one who carried the word of God,

23:12.134 --> 23:17.972
farmers organized into cooperatives, introducing solidarity.

23:18.183 --> 23:21.895
And when he had all these communities to reach,

23:22.020 --> 23:25.356
I could make impressive trips.

23:29.987 --> 23:32.613
Here we were more than 3,000 meters.

23:32.739 --> 23:38.036
Sometimes we climbed slopes of 600 to 700 meters per day.

23:38.538 --> 23:42.667
But I greatly enjoyed living in this landscape,

23:42.876 --> 23:44.585
in those communities.

23:47.631 --> 23:52.176
These are the Saraguros, a group of Indians in southern Ecuador.

23:52.302 --> 23:57.308
Very religious, but also heavy drinkers of alcohol.

23:58.057 --> 24:02.645
More than half of the community, on weekends, men and women

24:02.771 --> 24:05.065
They are completely drunk.

24:08.069 --> 24:10.154
The farmer left

24:10.822 --> 24:13.407
It called Lupe, Guadalupe.

24:13.783 --> 24:17.578
Lupe was my friend.

24:18.122 --> 24:21.207
At that time, I had very long hair,

24:21.333 --> 24:23.210
blonde and very long.

24:23.336 --> 24:26.546
And he had a big beard, redhead and blonde.

24:29.050 --> 24:31.677
One day we were walking through the mountains,

24:31.803 --> 24:35.430
He approached me and told me. "Look, Sebastião,

24:35.557 --> 24:38.476
I know that you have sent from heaven. "

24:38.601 --> 24:42.480
Because according to legend Saraguros

24:42.606 --> 24:46.359
the gods, to the image of Christ,

24:46.485 --> 24:50.989
They return to Earth to see them, to observe

24:51.115 --> 24:53.699
and see who deserved heaven.

24:53.825 --> 24:59.581
While touring the mountains, he took the opportunity to tell his life.

25:01.458 --> 25:06.462
He firmly believed that I was there to observe them.

25:06.589 --> 25:10.510
And up there counting their behavior.

25:14.348 --> 25:19.394
I had never seen before, an entire people

25:19.520 --> 25:23.191
another rhythm of time.

25:23.941 --> 25:29.822
The time I spent with Saraguros seemed a hundred years.

25:29.948 --> 25:32.325
Everything was so slow.

25:32.867 --> 25:36.829
It was another way of thinking, another speed.

25:39.000 --> 25:41.876
There were fatalism in their faces.

25:45.465 --> 25:48.383
This is in the state of Oaxaca in Mexico,

25:48.719 --> 25:52.136
is a group of peasants called mixes.

25:54.182 --> 25:58.686
There, everything is medieval, the plow, all ...

26:01.440 --> 26:04.317
It was the profound Latin America.

26:06.070 --> 26:08.821
He was a peasant village,

26:09.740 --> 26:14.244
but more important was the music that community.

26:14.454 --> 26:17.831
It was a people who loved music.

26:18.750 --> 26:24.088
All members of the community who could play an instrument

26:24.339 --> 26:26.590
They did not need to work.

26:27.092 --> 26:29.218
They worked as musicians.

26:34.057 --> 26:36.893
They let me sleep a few days

26:37.311 --> 26:41.188
in a cement room, very cold,

26:41.315 --> 26:45.443
to see if reluctant, if you really wanted to stay.

26:46.070 --> 26:48.447
As I managed to resist,

26:48.573 --> 26:51.575
I was taken from there and took me to a house.

26:51.701 --> 26:54.620
I went more to the community.

26:54.829 --> 26:56.331
And for me it was a pleasure.

26:56.665 --> 27:00.252
We became friends and coexisted in harmony in the community.

27:08.260 --> 27:12.263
This is in northern Mexico, are the Tarahumara.

27:13.058 --> 27:17.227
They are great runners are runners.

27:17.437 --> 27:19.271
They walk away.

27:19.815 --> 27:22.733
My God, it was hell follow these aborigines

27:22.859 --> 27:25.820
they were not walking, flying!

27:34.247 --> 27:35.747
This is a Tarahumara,

27:35.873 --> 27:40.502
with his face well marked, well lived.

27:43.382 --> 27:46.759
With her beautiful hair, great hair.

27:49.055 --> 27:52.140
Several times they came to my camera

27:52.266 --> 27:56.729
and they made me feel a sound technician.

27:57.772 --> 28:02.400
They told me things like I was recording them.

28:07.782 --> 28:12.828
The strength of a portrait is that in that split second

28:13.456 --> 28:17.833
We understand a little the life of the person photographed.

28:17.959 --> 28:21.838
The eyes speak volumes, the expression of the face.

28:24.092 --> 28:27.803
When you do a portrait, is not you alone who takes the picture.

28:27.929 --> 28:30.305
The person offers photo.

28:34.936 --> 28:37.772
Those trips were very important to me.

28:39.733 --> 28:44.987
To return after years without stepping on my country, to be here.

28:45.448 --> 28:48.992
The essence was the same, it was my continent, we were very close.

28:51.538 --> 28:55.874
"Other Americas" led him to Sebastião eight years.

28:56.168 --> 28:59.212
On this trip to South America deeper

28:59.337 --> 29:03.466
he simply disappeared for long periods.

29:03.968 --> 29:07.720
Julian grew up with a father who was almost always absent.

29:08.264 --> 29:11.683
His parents could at least correspond.

29:11.810 --> 29:15.938
Clearly this occurred before the current media.

29:17.357 --> 29:20.317
Each time he returned home to see his family

29:20.443 --> 29:23.111
and edit your photos with Lelia.

29:23.362 --> 29:26.950
Sebastião seemed like a great adventurer to his son.

29:27.076 --> 29:30.954
A superhero, rather than a photographer.

29:31.080 --> 29:32.079
i And cut!

29:33.623 --> 29:36.709
I am, thirty years later.

29:36.835 --> 29:40.423
Finally, I joined my father in one of his missions.

29:41.090 --> 29:42.215
A Wrangel,

29:42.342 --> 29:45.427
a desert island in the Arctic Ocean.

29:46.346 --> 29:48.263
Sebastião hoped to photograph

29:48.389 --> 29:51.183
the last great gathering of walruses.

29:52.560 --> 29:55.395
I wanted to find out who the man was,

29:55.521 --> 29:59.233
the man he had only known as father.

30:01.237 --> 30:07.326
I wanted to find the photographer, adventurer, for the first time.

31:31.165 --> 31:32.750
Cursed Bear!

31:32.876 --> 31:34.418
We had the bear.

31:34.544 --> 31:38.380
Incredible! It has made everyone from getting into the water.

32:17.257 --> 32:18.965
What are you thinking?

32:19.759 --> 32:21.719
What are you thinking, Father?

32:21.970 --> 32:26.182
I'm thinking, you know, doing this will be difficult.

32:29.519 --> 32:30.811
I do not know if it's okay.

32:46.704 --> 32:52.752
It is different when the bear is close, we can take a picture with him closely.

32:52.878 --> 32:55.211
But with a scenario that is not good.

32:55.630 --> 32:59.383
We have a document of the bear, but we do not have a photo.

33:00.218 --> 33:02.304
This is not right.

33:03.181 --> 33:05.848
There's nothing behind.

33:05.974 --> 33:09.602
Nothing to frame the photo, to beautify the landscape.

33:14.651 --> 33:17.028
Not have stock, we have nothing.

36:52.215 --> 36:53.590
Awesome!

36:54.217 --> 36:57.137
The image I had in the end, are the teeth out,

36:57.263 --> 37:00.515
They could not discern the shapes of heads, stunning.

37:00.642 --> 37:03.435
Like we were in Dante's Inferno,

37:03.561 --> 37:05.729
with all those teeth,

37:05.855 --> 37:08.022
all these forms ... Incredible!

37:29.255 --> 37:32.925
Father, talk to me a little of your 1979?

37:36.346 --> 37:40.140
In 79, Lélia was pregnant, expecting her second child.

37:40.266 --> 37:42.476
It would be child already knew.

37:44.354 --> 37:46.564
And when Rodrigo was born,

37:46.690 --> 37:51.612
everything was going to be Down syndrome.

37:52.238 --> 37:55.907
It was nice, torn eyes,

37:56.033 --> 37:59.911
and I had the impression that it was completely normal.

38:00.037 --> 38:01.788
And also Lélia.

38:02.414 --> 38:08.670
The doctor did many tests. Three weeks await your response.

38:08.797 --> 38:10.923
The day I called the doctor

38:12.175 --> 38:15.012
I felt such a strong tension,

38:15.137 --> 38:17.723
when I saw the answer, I cried.

38:17.848 --> 38:19.849
He could not stop mourn.

38:25.398 --> 38:29.441
My little brother would never be able to go to school,

38:29.569 --> 38:32.947
or read and write like me.

38:33.073 --> 38:37.076
Rodrigo would be isolated in a world that we were never going to be able to share.

38:37.952 --> 38:40.829
It was very difficult for my parents.

38:41.040 --> 38:43.167
But then something happened.

38:44.043 --> 38:47.587
Thanks to love, Rodrigo created his own language.

38:48.673 --> 38:49.673
Slowly,

38:50.091 --> 38:53.969
as a family, we learned to decipher their emotional alphabet

38:54.095 --> 38:56.512
and communicate without words.

39:00.852 --> 39:05.189
Poce later, my mother, my brother and I took a plane to Brazil.

39:05.315 --> 39:08.151
The military dictatorship had fallen.

39:08.277 --> 39:13.781
Topic five years and did not understand how important this trip was going to be.

39:14.742 --> 39:18.078
At one point, a man climbed one of the blinds

39:18.204 --> 39:21.749
and sunlight flooded the interior of the aircraft.

39:22.209 --> 39:24.919
A voice echoed in the cabin:

39:25.044 --> 39:27.172
"We are flying over Brazil."

39:27.297 --> 39:30.842
My mother looked out the window and said nothing.

39:30.968 --> 39:35.555
He was seeing his homeland for the first time after many years.

39:36.058 --> 39:39.852
It was a moment of happiness, and yet, when I looked,

39:40.437 --> 39:42.020
I was crying.

39:45.108 --> 39:49.237
My father was in French Guiana and would come later.

39:50.530 --> 39:54.200
December 31, returning to Brazil.

39:54.326 --> 39:57.412
It was great to get to your country,

39:58.080 --> 40:01.165
After 10 years, half out.

40:02.167 --> 40:06.546
It was shocking. Lelia had left the Vitoria was not found.

40:07.383 --> 40:11.176
Vitória urbanism had changed. Everything had changed.

40:12.303 --> 40:14.639
My region had changed.

40:15.306 --> 40:20.228
I met again with my parents. The I left young and strong.

40:20.437 --> 40:24.983
On returning I found an old man. My father was very old.

40:25.860 --> 40:27.152
But, at that time,

40:27.278 --> 40:30.780
I wanted to see Brazil further.

40:31.616 --> 40:33.742
My sister gave me a car

40:34.952 --> 40:38.329
and I traveled for six months in the northeast of Brazil.

40:38.457 --> 40:40.457
He did not know the northeast.

40:40.584 --> 40:43.920
He had always dreamed of northeastern Brazil.

41:06.652 --> 41:09.487
I met these people on a funeral.

41:10.157 --> 41:14.410
I parked on the side of the road and went with them.

41:16.621 --> 41:21.376
Infant mortality was very high in the northeast of Brazil.

41:21.877 --> 41:25.547
These are children who died before baptism.

41:27.384 --> 41:30.678
It is believed that unbaptized children

41:31.387 --> 41:34.682
They have no right to go to heaven.

41:35.100 --> 41:39.644
They stay in a region between both worlds, called limbo.

41:41.148 --> 41:45.693
Children buried with his eyes closed, they were baptized.

41:45.820 --> 41:47.487
If his eyes were open ...

41:47.613 --> 41:51.032
and they buried him to find his way.

41:51.158 --> 41:55.872
Otherwise, it was wandering for eternity.

42:04.214 --> 42:08.593
At that time, the coffins were rented in the church.

42:08.719 --> 42:11.179
Rent the coffin was cheaper.

42:11.847 --> 42:15.183
The same coffin was used dozens of times.

42:21.858 --> 42:26.112
This is perfectly seen the coffins to rent ...

42:28.866 --> 42:30.950
and these are shoes.

42:31.076 --> 42:35.496
He sold everything: shoes, coffins, bananas, vegetables,

42:35.706 --> 42:38.542
ice cream, all ...

42:39.459 --> 42:45.131
It is an area of ​​the world where life and death are very close.

42:48.637 --> 42:52.890
Here is a prayer group

42:53.016 --> 42:56.601
exerting political work at the same time.

42:57.354 --> 43:00.855
In Brazil, we had and still have

43:00.983 --> 43:04.069
a great movement of landless peasants.

43:04.278 --> 43:08.865
Many of them, the majority come from here.

43:09.658 --> 43:12.243
Proviene del northeast of Brazil.

43:19.127 --> 43:20.127
They are people

43:20.503 --> 43:23.130
a great moral force,

43:23.256 --> 43:25.717
great physical strength,

43:25.844 --> 43:30.805
despite being very fragile because they eat poorly.

43:31.515 --> 43:35.477
Look at the dryness of the area. It is very dry.

43:36.187 --> 43:40.273
Why so, we have a piece of Sahel here in Brazil.

43:43.278 --> 43:45.237
And here in the street,

43:45.363 --> 43:48.491
people leave for good.

43:48.826 --> 43:51.871
Sometimes the land is so dry, so hard,

43:51.997 --> 43:54.580
people migrate to cities in the south.

43:54.707 --> 43:57.876
They give up, leave the land.

44:19.151 --> 44:20.899
FARM SALGALO

44:20.900 --> 44:23.029
MINAS GERAIS, BRAZIL

44:25.489 --> 44:27.532
We have spent many years suffering a shortage of rain.

44:41.632 --> 44:46.761
Here we had many cattle.

44:46.887 --> 44:49.139
Now we have nothing, it's over.

44:50.183 --> 44:52.202
The drought was great.

44:52.237 --> 44:56.342
He finished with pastures, ended income.

44:56.897 --> 44:58.732
How it ended, Grandpa? Why it's over?

44:58.858 --> 45:00.751
It ended because of the drought.

45:03.363 --> 45:07.742
He stood around, but no one saw or a grass grow.

45:07.867 --> 45:09.912
Now we just have time.

45:10.579 --> 45:12.788
Between your father and I,

45:12.915 --> 45:15.917
20,000 invested in that.

45:16.460 --> 45:17.586
Where you are?

45:19.546 --> 45:21.506
Here he abounded all.

45:22.132 --> 45:26.637
There were many birds many sparrows.

45:27.055 --> 45:30.642
Canarios, tico-ticos,

45:31.435 --> 45:32.935
zorzales ...

45:34.396 --> 45:38.148
There on the hill, there was a good kill.

45:38.275 --> 45:42.237
And in that summit also he had a very good head.

45:43.071 --> 45:45.866
There is much erosion.

45:45.992 --> 45:47.795
Now, for example, the land is bonded.

45:47.909 --> 45:52.154
If rains come, there no grass, nothing,

45:52.189 --> 45:56.293
to hold, cause a disaster.

45:57.212 --> 45:59.172
I have no idea ...

45:59.173 --> 46:02.740
to know how to stop erosion.

46:11.435 --> 46:14.522
He grandfather, he was in the hacienda happy?

46:14.648 --> 46:15.648
What?

46:15.774 --> 46:18.526
If I was in this hacienda happy?

46:20.695 --> 46:21.988
¿Si was happy?

46:22.155 --> 46:24.990
I was happy to have my children.

46:25.116 --> 46:27.701
I raised all, seven women,

46:28.245 --> 46:30.746
with six career as Tiao.

46:30.872 --> 46:34.000
I raised my children here with difficulty.

46:34.419 --> 46:35.710
I was happy.

46:39.090 --> 46:40.730
Only wood I took over a hundred contos

46:43.303 --> 46:45.512
to take my children to school.

46:45.639 --> 46:49.017
All were raised with good nutrition

46:49.143 --> 46:51.310
with good clothes.

46:56.984 --> 47:01.237
Since I arrived in Brazil, the land of my grandfather have been.

47:01.614 --> 47:04.908
Burned and dry.

47:05.368 --> 47:10.247
When Sebastião returned to the farm after traveling the northeast of Brazil,

47:10.373 --> 47:14.376
the place had nothing to do with paradise he remembered as a child.

47:14.795 --> 47:18.005
But he worried about something else.

47:18.131 --> 47:21.717
The suffering he saw, changed.

47:22.469 --> 47:25.930
His role as a photographer took on new meaning.

47:26.057 --> 47:29.101
We understood how important it was for him to leave.

47:30.811 --> 47:36.525
She missed him terribly, but I understood.

47:45.285 --> 47:48.078
Sahel, THE END OF THE ROAD 1984-1986

47:48.205 --> 47:52.417
For his next project, which would lead to Sahel in Africa,

47:52.542 --> 47:56.381
Sebastião began working with MSF.

48:01.761 --> 48:04.890
I worked in Ethiopia in 1984.

48:05.892 --> 48:10.602
And then I continued throughout the Sahel, 85 and 86.

48:10.854 --> 48:14.775
Finally, spend nearly two years in a row in this region

48:14.902 --> 48:18.236
doing a story about hunger.

48:21.616 --> 48:23.659
There was a refugee camp,

48:23.785 --> 48:26.953
the largest in the history of mankind so far.

48:27.204 --> 48:30.374
I had a wild desire to show that.

48:30.501 --> 48:34.503
To show that there was a large part of humanity

48:34.755 --> 48:37.590
He is living in poverty.

48:38.008 --> 48:41.803
Which it was mostly a problem of deals

48:42.056 --> 48:45.598
not just a question of natural disasters.

48:48.352 --> 48:51.063
It was a Coptic region

48:51.188 --> 48:55.275
They are Christians in northern Ethiopia,

48:55.401 --> 48:57.737
of tremendous humility.

48:58.071 --> 49:00.823
They are unable, even with a child about to die,

49:00.949 --> 49:03.617
to take the lead of others.

49:03.743 --> 49:05.661
They prefer to wait.

49:12.253 --> 49:14.754
Look at the state are.

49:16.632 --> 49:20.470
In that state, one does not stand long.

49:20.886 --> 49:24.514
In those fields hunger killed many lives.

49:25.058 --> 49:28.310
Causes physical discomfort,

49:28.436 --> 49:31.397
but other diseases that they kill.

49:33.525 --> 49:37.862
If we take the anger, we become dehydrated quickly.

49:37.988 --> 49:42.408
We can lose up to 12 liters of fluid a day due to diarrhea

49:42.869 --> 49:45.327
and die in two or three days.

49:50.335 --> 49:52.503
So young faces

49:53.547 --> 49:57.509
and so aged by suffering.

49:57.926 --> 50:01.263
If you look at the front, it is not elderly,

50:01.389 --> 50:05.099
it has aged are the eyes, which are empty.

50:05.351 --> 50:08.478
Look how young he is. Look at your baby.

50:09.022 --> 50:10.939
He was her husband.

50:15.612 --> 50:19.198
During the night because of the cold, many deaths they occur.

50:22.744 --> 50:26.705
Dying here is like a continuation of life.

50:26.831 --> 50:29.376
People get used to die.

50:31.128 --> 50:34.340
A husband to his wife washed before burial.

50:37.553 --> 50:41.889
With mountain clothes, dressed in goatskins.

50:45.769 --> 50:47.645
A pretty young woman.

50:53.360 --> 50:55.611
According to Coptic beliefs,

50:55.738 --> 50:59.658
the body must be clean for the encounter with God.

50:59.784 --> 51:02.953
It should be washed, wash it all

51:03.580 --> 51:05.998
although water is scarce.

51:09.795 --> 51:13.672
Every person killed is a piece of the world that dies.

51:21.932 --> 51:25.352
A father prepares his son for burial,

51:25.478 --> 51:27.980
to say the last goodbye.

51:31.234 --> 51:33.861
Usually it is the family that prepares its dead.

51:41.997 --> 51:43.746
And know that the government

51:43.872 --> 51:48.793
retains food, not allowed to reach the population

51:48.919 --> 51:51.880
as happened there,

51:52.006 --> 51:54.550
in that field in northern Ethiopia ...

51:54.968 --> 51:59.346
It was a brutal political dishonesty.

52:11.193 --> 52:13.987
Ethiopia Tigray Region, 1984

52:14.363 --> 52:18.950
I returned to Ethiopia in late 1984.

52:19.326 --> 52:23.997
By then, the guerrillas realized that the government was plundering the region.

52:24.123 --> 52:27.251
They began to send people to Sudan.

52:27.836 --> 52:31.047
They went through the region of Tigray.

52:34.802 --> 52:37.345
There was an attack by two helicopters.

52:37.471 --> 52:41.184
They were Mi-24 combat helicopters very fast.

52:41.309 --> 52:43.851
They shot people with machine guns.

52:45.229 --> 52:47.731
I took a picture and ran.

52:51.611 --> 52:54.030
Many pregnant women walked

52:54.156 --> 52:59.743
hoping to be able to eat and drink water

52:59.870 --> 53:02.580
to reach the promised land.

53:06.627 --> 53:09.045
I had to go there

53:10.047 --> 53:12.256
at least two more months.

53:12.634 --> 53:15.009
And when I arrived in Sudan,

53:15.219 --> 53:18.513
I had a lot of work with the arrival of these people.

53:22.769 --> 53:25.271
This man came from Ethiopia.

53:25.397 --> 53:28.774
His son was exhausted, perhaps dead,

53:28.900 --> 53:31.194
but the man was carrying.

53:31.320 --> 53:34.531
When he got to the doctors the child was dead,

53:36.158 --> 53:38.494
after so much walking.

53:47.004 --> 53:50.214
We had to decamp from MSF.

53:50.507 --> 53:53.634
Water is essential in these camps

53:53.760 --> 53:55.553
and it was becoming a big problem.

53:55.679 --> 53:58.931
You had to move as quickly as possible.

54:03.272 --> 54:07.232
They piled into the trucks of the United Nations

54:07.484 --> 54:10.944
to take them to another camp,

54:11.155 --> 54:14.448
a beautiful and fertile land

54:14.700 --> 54:17.243
on the banks of the Blue Nile.

54:18.162 --> 54:22.373
I did about 300, 400 kilometers aboard these trucks.

54:26.254 --> 54:28.463
Two of my friends truck,

54:28.589 --> 54:32.760
They acted as if it were a Sunday afternoon either,

54:32.886 --> 54:36.471
and they were telling stories under a tree.

54:40.185 --> 54:43.438
Being close to the Nile, we had water.

54:43.564 --> 54:47.318
But here people died

54:47.568 --> 54:49.485
because there was no food.

54:49.778 --> 54:52.780
They reached the edge of poverty.

54:56.536 --> 55:00.873
They forgot or could not bring food.

55:00.999 --> 55:03.793
There was a disorganization of food.

55:03.919 --> 55:06.128
They said there was, that there was.

55:06.254 --> 55:09.091
And when I got here there was nothing.

55:20.520 --> 55:22.646
Me fui a Mali.

55:23.483 --> 55:26.317
Here too there was a great drought.

55:28.069 --> 55:31.280
The skin of the people were like the bark of trees.

55:31.615 --> 55:35.368
Trees marked by wind and sand,

55:35.786 --> 55:39.081
by sandstorms.

55:49.050 --> 55:51.217
There were only women and children.

55:51.469 --> 55:54.096
The men went to Libya to work,

55:54.222 --> 55:59.434
or they migrated to Ivory Coast in search of work

55:59.561 --> 56:03.357
with the promise to return and bring food for the family.

56:03.483 --> 56:05.942
But very few returned.

56:15.995 --> 56:18.288
All were safe

56:18.415 --> 56:21.292
because MSF did a great job.

56:21.418 --> 56:24.545
They brought aid to the region.

56:27.299 --> 56:30.885
This is a friend, Luc, a Belgian doctor.

56:31.553 --> 56:36.557
It is measuring and weighing the child.

56:38.812 --> 56:42.397
After 15, 20 days, they were unrecognizable, healthier.

56:42.524 --> 56:45.232
But they were scarred for life

56:45.359 --> 56:49.738
because they lacked things during growth.

56:55.078 --> 56:56.745
This kid was alone,

56:57.457 --> 57:00.667
with his little guitar in hand,

57:00.792 --> 57:04.338
He is carrying the remains of a shirt,

57:04.672 --> 57:06.424
but not wearing pants.

57:07.758 --> 57:11.763
Watch her determination, her posture.

57:11.889 --> 57:15.224
He is someone who knows where it goes.

57:15.350 --> 57:19.896
Looking for other groups of people,

57:20.731 --> 57:22.023
with your dog ...

57:22.149 --> 57:24.986
A boy of eight, nine years.

57:30.658 --> 57:33.328
Sebastian is encariñó

57:33.454 --> 57:36.663
with the people of the Sahel region.

57:36.789 --> 57:38.833
Again and again.

57:40.502 --> 57:45.047
Photos, the book and the exhibition of Lélia

57:45.173 --> 57:47.843
They called the world's attention on droughts,

57:47.969 --> 57:50.137
and the fate of millions of lives.

57:50.554 --> 57:54.808
And unanswered questions about the cause of that situation.

57:56.853 --> 58:01.440
Then Sebastião turned to a topic that he spent another six years

58:01.566 --> 58:05.779
and countless trips to almost thirty countries.

58:05.946 --> 58:07.237
WORKERS

58:07.363 --> 58:12.553
The third volume of photographs conceived with Lélia.

58:12.577 --> 58:16.206
I wanted to pay a kind of homage

58:16.748 --> 58:20.669
all men and women who built our world.

58:21.679 --> 58:24.177
The archeology of the industrial era.

58:25.883 --> 58:28.010
Sebastian y Lelia investigaron

58:28.136 --> 58:30.804
and planned "Workers" meticulously.

58:31.515 --> 58:35.559
Then he again traveled to the four corners of the world.

58:37.729 --> 58:40.013
He photographed steelworkers in the Soviet Union,

58:40.232 --> 58:42.109
he lived with saboteurs ships in Bangladesh,

58:42.734 --> 58:45.737
sailed with fishermen in Galicia and Sicily,

58:46.194 --> 58:49.032
He showed the mechanical production of cars in Kolkata.

58:49.325 --> 58:51.452
He watched farmers in Rwanda,

58:51.578 --> 58:54.622
country had already visited, but as an economist.

58:55.206 --> 58:57.625
Now the mission was another.

58:57.793 --> 59:01.545
His perspective had changed, but he was the same.

59:01.881 --> 59:05.674
Driven by the same empathy for the human condition.

59:06.219 --> 59:09.013
With each episode of "workers"

59:09.478 --> 59:11.598
Sebastião was completely submerged

59:12.725 --> 59:15.142
in the field of manual labor.

59:15.269 --> 59:18.731
As the weeks passed with miners in the gold mines of Serra Pelada.

59:20.979 --> 59:26.325
In 1991, at the end of the first Gulf War,

59:26.360 --> 59:27.866
Iraqi troops withdrew

59:27.991 --> 59:31.591
and Saddam Hussein set fire to thousands of oil wells.

59:32.079 --> 59:37.166
Thousands of firefighters from around the world descended on those oil fields.

59:37.460 --> 59:40.588
Sebastião had to go too,

59:40.714 --> 59:44.592
driven by curiosity of this explosive profession.

59:53.435 --> 59:56.561
When I saw the first images on TV,

59:57.523 --> 01:00:00.942
I knew I had to do that report.

01:00:02.319 --> 01:00:05.739
It was like working in a big theater.

01:00:06.283 --> 01:00:08.575
Some 500 wells on fire.

01:00:08.701 --> 01:00:13.121
A scene set in huge, the size of a planet.

01:00:13.416 --> 01:00:17.752
No controlled us, we could go where we wanted.

01:00:19.254 --> 01:00:23.425
There were fumes, thick smoke, oil.

01:00:24.009 --> 01:00:28.721
All that accumulated smoke was so dense that the sun did not pass.

01:00:29.183 --> 01:00:35.645
Sometimes it was dark 24 hours.

01:00:41.821 --> 01:00:43.987
After putting out the fire

01:00:44.113 --> 01:00:47.075
the ground was so hot,

01:00:47.201 --> 01:00:51.370
I had to throw a lot of water for cooling,

01:00:51.496 --> 01:00:56.168
if not, the temperature was so high that oil burn again.

01:00:57.545 --> 01:00:59.254
Still, sometimes,

01:00:59.380 --> 01:01:03.593
There was an explosion that sounded like a cannon.

01:01:04.595 --> 01:01:06.845
The noise was deafening.

01:01:06.971 --> 01:01:10.808
It was like working near the engine of a plane.

01:01:11.476 --> 01:01:13.643
Today I'm a little deaf.

01:01:13.937 --> 01:01:16.231
My deafness began then.

01:01:33.083 --> 01:01:34.415
These are Canadians,

01:01:34.543 --> 01:01:37.211
The Calgary Fire Department.

01:01:38.839 --> 01:01:41.424
They brought a nice red truck.

01:01:41.550 --> 01:01:45.012
And they had a rule: after putting out the fire,

01:01:45.137 --> 01:01:48.306
I had to wash the truck every night.

01:01:48.432 --> 01:01:51.768
The next morning, returned to be covered in oil.

01:01:57.567 --> 01:01:59.777
A hell of a job!

01:02:03.073 --> 01:02:05.033
I delayed my departure at least two or three times.

01:02:06.786 --> 01:02:08.662
Until the day I had to leave.

01:02:08.788 --> 01:02:12.041
It broke my heart

01:02:12.167 --> 01:02:15.544
having to leave such a huge show.

01:02:17.881 --> 01:02:19.798
I turned around,

01:02:19.924 --> 01:02:22.468
until near the end,

01:02:22.761 --> 01:02:26.639
when we passed a big wall.

01:02:26.765 --> 01:02:30.268
That day was a reporter for the New York Times.

01:02:30.977 --> 01:02:35.315
It was no longer anyone's territory. The war had destroyed everything.

01:02:35.732 --> 01:02:37.483
We broke the door.

01:02:37.734 --> 01:02:39.153
Upon entering,

01:02:39.946 --> 01:02:42.488
a species discovered

01:02:42.614 --> 01:02:44.074
Paradise

01:02:44.201 --> 01:02:46.242
become a hell.

01:02:46.869 --> 01:02:50.956
It was a kind of Garden of the royal family of Kuwait.

01:02:52.333 --> 01:02:55.251
There were horses, thoroughbreds,

01:02:55.587 --> 01:02:59.216
they had gone completely mad.

01:03:00.342 --> 01:03:03.970
The animals are the first to escape before a catastrophe,

01:03:04.096 --> 01:03:06.639
if they are free to escape.

01:03:06.974 --> 01:03:09.184
But there they were not.

01:03:10.270 --> 01:03:13.230
Birds found there, it was an oasis.

01:03:13.357 --> 01:03:15.566
Everything was well irrigated.

01:03:16.276 --> 01:03:20.947
Birds that could not fly because they were glued feathers.

01:03:24.201 --> 01:03:27.954
Kuwaitis left to reach the disaster

01:03:28.789 --> 01:03:31.875
leaving the confined animals,

01:03:32.001 --> 01:03:35.670
together with the Bedouins, who are not considered human beings.

01:03:37.657 --> 01:03:42.091
"Workers" managed to unite the Sebastião Salgado economist

01:03:42.126 --> 01:03:44.221
with the artist in which he had become.

01:03:45.180 --> 01:03:48.017
These photographs have been published in the best journals,

01:03:48.143 --> 01:03:50.185
the exhibition toured the world,

01:03:50.312 --> 01:03:53.064
and the book was published in many languages.

01:03:54.400 --> 01:03:57.611
Pero Sebastian y Lelia in pararon.

01:03:58.154 --> 01:04:02.991
They immediately began work on a new phase of his photography.

01:04:03.243 --> 01:04:07.371
They noted that another burning issue of our times

01:04:07.705 --> 01:04:10.457
It was the displacement of entire populations

01:04:10.584 --> 01:04:14.503
due to wars, famines and the role of the global market.

01:04:15.463 --> 01:04:18.967
As Europe closed its borders,

01:04:19.260 --> 01:04:23.763
Sebastião trying to shed light on the lives of the marginalized.

01:04:24.808 --> 01:04:29.395
Again with Lelia, he began researching and planning.

01:04:29.520 --> 01:04:33.483
She was again the momentum of this new chapter

01:04:33.608 --> 01:04:35.859
which they called "Exodus".

01:04:36.403 --> 01:04:38.028
EXODUS

01:04:38.988 --> 01:04:43.034
It sparked global concern about the lives of these refugees

01:04:43.160 --> 01:04:45.203
de India, Vietnam, Filipinas,

01:04:45.329 --> 01:04:47.372
South America, Palestine, Iraq

01:04:47.498 --> 01:04:49.291
and many other places.

01:04:50.210 --> 01:04:53.795
But Sebastião returned again and again to the continent

01:04:53.921 --> 01:04:57.717
I had captivated his imagination for some time already.

01:04:58.217 --> 01:04:59.802
A África.

01:05:10.731 --> 01:05:13.899
I was doing my project on population movements

01:05:16.653 --> 01:05:19.905
in 1994, when the Rwandan president's plane

01:05:20.492 --> 01:05:22.493
He was killed.

01:05:23.245 --> 01:05:26.580
It all started with a great movement of population to Tanzania

01:05:26.706 --> 01:05:31.585
due to the brutal repression against the Tutsis in Rwanda.

01:05:33.046 --> 01:05:36.673
And I was one of the first to arrive.

01:05:37.384 --> 01:05:39.551
It was a catastrophe.

01:05:39.678 --> 01:05:42.014
People who fled to Burundi,

01:05:42.264 --> 01:05:44.600
al Congo, a Uganda...

01:05:44.726 --> 01:05:46.893
They fled to everywhere.

01:05:51.148 --> 01:05:54.986
The streets were full of people.

01:05:58.031 --> 01:06:00.158
People resting on the side of the road,

01:06:00.284 --> 01:06:04.121
he carried all their belongings on bicycles ...

01:06:04.246 --> 01:06:07.207
People who fled with what they could.

01:06:08.875 --> 01:06:11.586
We follow the path in the opposite direction.

01:06:11.880 --> 01:06:15.089
We went to the border.

01:06:15.215 --> 01:06:17.967
There was no security, no nothing.

01:06:18.093 --> 01:06:22.182
I came to Rwanda and that was frightening.

01:06:22.389 --> 01:06:26.936
The death toll I met on these roads.

01:06:29.731 --> 01:06:31.566
It had broken Granada.

01:06:32.233 --> 01:06:36.737
Those who were not killed by the Granada were killed with machetes.

01:06:37.532 --> 01:06:40.991
I understood the magnitude

01:06:41.117 --> 01:06:44.955
the catastrophe he was seeing.

01:06:45.832 --> 01:06:48.626
Genocide was committed in that country.

01:06:51.629 --> 01:06:56.426
Were about 150 kilometers to the outskirts of Kigali,

01:06:56.551 --> 01:06:59.304
and 150 kilometers of dead.

01:07:07.606 --> 01:07:11.066
I returned because my story was about you people.

01:07:11.192 --> 01:07:15.195
He was writing a book on refugees, on the exodus.

01:07:15.656 --> 01:07:17.782
I went into these camps

01:07:18.199 --> 01:07:19.909
and I began to see

01:07:20.035 --> 01:07:23.829
the number of people who left Rwanda.

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.835
Hell settled in this paradise.

01:07:29.754 --> 01:07:32.297
It was frightening

01:07:32.423 --> 01:07:36.010
see how in such a beautiful savanna

01:07:36.136 --> 01:07:39.263
He had formed a megacity.

01:07:41.809 --> 01:07:45.686
Within days, there were almost a million people there.

01:07:52.319 --> 01:07:56.157
Amid all this anguish, something touched me very much.

01:07:56.491 --> 01:07:59.993
It was seeing this mother with her little,

01:08:00.119 --> 01:08:03.872
and little confidence in her mother.

01:08:17.180 --> 01:08:18.720
Violence

01:08:19.432 --> 01:08:21.057
and brutality

01:08:21.184 --> 01:08:24.560
they are not a monopoly

01:08:24.854 --> 01:08:26.645
of distant countries.

01:08:26.773 --> 01:08:30.024
It is here, in Europe, in the former Yugoslavia.

01:08:30.151 --> 01:08:32.153
It's very shocking.

01:08:34.865 --> 01:08:38.868
On a bus coming from Krajina, Croatia across ...

01:08:40.037 --> 01:08:42.412
One person was killed through that hole.

01:08:42.538 --> 01:08:46.542
Croats killed many people to leave Krajina.

01:08:47.252 --> 01:08:49.045
Violence is widespread.

01:08:49.173 --> 01:08:52.506
What I dislike most

01:08:52.716 --> 01:08:56.720
It is to see how much hatred is contagious.

01:08:57.471 --> 01:08:59.890
These people have seen violence.

01:09:00.265 --> 01:09:01.558
Entire families.

01:09:01.685 --> 01:09:05.856
All Krajina Serb population was expelled.

01:09:08.024 --> 01:09:12.403
From time to time they were driven from their homes

01:09:12.529 --> 01:09:14.781
looking for a place where to go.

01:09:14.907 --> 01:09:19.368
They had their neighbors in front and shooting at them.

01:09:34.345 --> 01:09:37.305
This is a refugee camp near Tuzla,

01:09:37.930 --> 01:09:40.890
en la Bosnia central.

01:09:41.018 --> 01:09:43.979
They are families fleeing the enclave of Zepa,

01:09:44.648 --> 01:09:48.149
where Serbs killed thousands of young people.

01:09:49.153 --> 01:09:54.364
We were there at the right time. Just as families arrived

01:09:54.950 --> 01:09:57.536
in a state of high anxiety.

01:10:09.048 --> 01:10:11.884
There were only women, elderly

01:10:12.302 --> 01:10:13.843
and children.

01:10:13.969 --> 01:10:18.390
The young men had been detained or killed.

01:10:24.606 --> 01:10:27.525
It is rare that this happens in Europe,

01:10:27.651 --> 01:10:30.820
the late twentieth century.

01:10:31.155 --> 01:10:32.572
But here, the cars,

01:10:32.699 --> 01:10:36.577
we can see that those people with a standard of living

01:10:36.703 --> 01:10:38.705
a European standard of living,

01:10:39.164 --> 01:10:41.874
with a European intellectual level.

01:10:42.208 --> 01:10:44.375
A European infrastructure.

01:10:44.753 --> 01:10:46.170
And who lost everything.

01:10:50.426 --> 01:10:54.387
Hundreds of kilometers filled with people and cars.

01:10:58.476 --> 01:11:00.353
We are a very fierce animal.

01:11:00.479 --> 01:11:03.356
We are a terrible animal, we humans.

01:11:04.816 --> 01:11:08.611
It is here in Europe, whether in Africa, Latin America, wherever.

01:11:08.737 --> 01:11:11.404
Our violence is extreme.

01:11:18.247 --> 01:11:20.456
Our history is a history of wars.

01:11:27.674 --> 01:11:29.173
It is a story without end,

01:11:29.300 --> 01:11:31.427
a history of repression,

01:11:31.553 --> 01:11:33.220
crazy story.

01:11:42.149 --> 01:11:44.900
The situation in Rwanda continued to evolve.

01:11:45.109 --> 01:11:49.196
The Hutu army, which had the power, was defeated.

01:11:49.322 --> 01:11:54.410
And he retired to the Congo and the region of Goma.

01:11:55.746 --> 01:12:00.291
First, the Tutsis had fled the barbarity of the Hutus.

01:12:00.417 --> 01:12:02.168
Then they were Hutus

01:12:02.293 --> 01:12:05.005
those fleeing Tutsi occupation.

01:12:05.129 --> 01:12:07.173
So they all fled.

01:12:10.302 --> 01:12:12.137
In several days,

01:12:12.262 --> 01:12:15.223
in the month of July 1994

01:12:15.349 --> 01:12:16.766
Goma region

01:12:16.892 --> 01:12:19.936
He welcomed more than two million people.

01:12:21.481 --> 01:12:24.024
And there catastrophe was installed,

01:12:27.029 --> 01:12:29.948
diseases such as cholera began to spread

01:12:30.074 --> 01:12:33.868
and people started dropping like flies.

01:12:34.328 --> 01:12:37.747
There were at least 12,000 or 15,000 deaths a day.

01:12:41.585 --> 01:12:44.504
I took pictures of piles of dead like this.

01:12:45.089 --> 01:12:47.758
I saw that father approached with his child,

01:12:48.175 --> 01:12:49.677
and throw it there.

01:12:49.803 --> 01:12:54.014
He was chatting with fellow like that.

01:13:00.814 --> 01:13:03.898
We did not give supply to bury people.

01:13:04.943 --> 01:13:07.863
Machine brought a French army

01:13:08.115 --> 01:13:11.825
and caught galore, dozens,

01:13:12.077 --> 01:13:14.160
They threw them on the ground

01:13:14.286 --> 01:13:17.039
and covered with soil.

01:13:34.351 --> 01:13:36.768
Everyone should see these images,

01:13:37.228 --> 01:13:40.146
to see how terrible it is our species.

01:13:46.780 --> 01:13:50.158
These orphans, I found them on the road ...

01:13:52.037 --> 01:13:53.494
Of these three children

01:13:53.620 --> 01:13:57.207
the two with the most lively eyes will survive.

01:13:57.333 --> 01:14:01.378
The eyes of the morbid, he was dying.

01:14:04.006 --> 01:14:06.801
When I left there, I was sick.

01:14:07.051 --> 01:14:09.469
Very sick. My body was sick.

01:14:09.680 --> 01:14:13.182
It was not an infectious disease,

01:14:13.475 --> 01:14:15.435
my soul was sick.

01:14:20.317 --> 01:14:24.403
I went to Rwanda a year after the disaster

01:14:24.529 --> 01:14:29.326
for the return of Hutus, who were in the Congo

01:14:29.658 --> 01:14:31.577
and they had nowhere to go.

01:14:31.703 --> 01:14:36.040
The United Nations began to force them to return.

01:14:46.970 --> 01:14:51.264
We felt that the whole planet was covered in refugee tents.

01:15:04.446 --> 01:15:06.447
After working there,

01:15:06.572 --> 01:15:11.119
Tutsi authorities proposed visit me

01:15:11.245 --> 01:15:15.164
several places, scenes of repression.

01:15:21.840 --> 01:15:26.802
People took refuge in a church thinking that could be saved.

01:15:27.513 --> 01:15:30.014
All were killed.

01:15:36.563 --> 01:15:38.773
This was at a school,

01:15:39.191 --> 01:15:43.944
You can still see the blackboard with written when passing through.

01:15:44.071 --> 01:15:46.156
it was scary.

01:16:00.088 --> 01:16:04.258
Of people who left Rwanda, some two million people,

01:16:04.384 --> 01:16:07.054
some returned to Rwanda,

01:16:07.180 --> 01:16:09.889
but the other feared a possible crackdown.

01:16:10.015 --> 01:16:15.062
A group of 250,000 people left the city of Goma

01:16:15.187 --> 01:16:17.440
and he went into the Congo forest.

01:16:20.570 --> 01:16:21.861
We lost.

01:16:21.987 --> 01:16:25.949
Everyone knew they were lost 250,000 people.

01:16:26.075 --> 01:16:28.033
We did not know where they were.

01:16:31.121 --> 01:16:32.580
Six months later,

01:16:33.166 --> 01:16:37.794
They began to appear Kisangani in central Congo.

01:16:40.216 --> 01:16:43.884
They were in the forest for six months.

01:16:45.011 --> 01:16:50.265
And here, the UN High Commissioner was taking me right there.

01:16:51.434 --> 01:16:54.561
There was a train and rode me.

01:16:55.647 --> 01:16:59.025
The train, after leaving the food, he should return.

01:17:06.701 --> 01:17:11.706
I spent three days with these people kept coming.

01:17:11.832 --> 01:17:14.458
Groups and groups of people coming.

01:17:16.794 --> 01:17:20.298
But when you think about 250,000 people left,

01:17:20.424 --> 01:17:23.093
and 40,000 returnees ...

01:17:23.427 --> 01:17:27.472
210,000 people were missing.

01:17:37.401 --> 01:17:39.818
And in parallel, life continued.

01:17:39.944 --> 01:17:44.657
Men who cut hair.

01:17:45.575 --> 01:17:47.912
And this Congolese here,

01:17:48.036 --> 01:17:49.787
with his calculator

01:17:51.081 --> 01:17:56.628
dollars trying to collect people,

01:17:56.754 --> 01:18:00.006
currencies, and it was there trying to change them.

01:18:00.467 --> 01:18:04.887
In the middle of nowhere! Amid a forest isolated from everything.

01:18:12.312 --> 01:18:13.521
At one point,

01:18:14.023 --> 01:18:18.568
that the guerrillas Kisangani, which was protutsi,

01:18:18.695 --> 01:18:21.071
and he began to cast these people.

01:18:21.447 --> 01:18:22.989
To send them back.

01:18:23.115 --> 01:18:27.495
They had to walk another six months to return to Rwanda.

01:18:27.621 --> 01:18:29.705
They began to kill some.

01:18:30.832 --> 01:18:35.336
There, I met people who could not more.

01:18:35.963 --> 01:18:38.756
They had begun to rave,

01:18:38.882 --> 01:18:40.799
They had lost his mind.

01:18:40.926 --> 01:18:42.509
They had gone mad.

01:18:47.892 --> 01:18:51.311
In fact, this people who were expelled,

01:18:51.729 --> 01:18:54.022
We have not heard anything.

01:18:55.442 --> 01:18:57.902
I'm sure they were all killed.

01:19:05.660 --> 01:19:10.790
This was my last trip, this sad adventure in Rwanda.

01:19:14.545 --> 01:19:16.671
I went there.

01:19:18.258 --> 01:19:23.011
He does not believe in anything. He did not believe in the salvation of the human race.

01:19:23.138 --> 01:19:25.806
We could not survive that.

01:19:25.932 --> 01:19:27.725
We did not deserve to live anymore.

01:19:27.851 --> 01:19:29.810
No one deserved to live.

01:19:39.989 --> 01:19:44.994
How many times I threw the camera down to mourn for what he saw?

01:19:51.376 --> 01:19:55.755
Sebastião had peered into the heart of darkness

01:19:55.881 --> 01:19:59.466
and he questioned his work as a social photographer

01:19:59.592 --> 01:20:02.720
and witness to the human condition.

01:20:02.930 --> 01:20:07.143
What remained to be done after Rwanda?

01:20:14.401 --> 01:20:19.030
At that time, my grandfather's health worsened.

01:20:19.656 --> 01:20:23.785
My parents had to return to Brazil to take over the farm.

01:20:24.369 --> 01:20:29.041
It was just barren land. They did not know what to do with that.

01:20:30.210 --> 01:20:34.422
Birds, alligators and forests had disappeared.

01:20:34.590 --> 01:20:38.650
There was no childhood memories of Sebastião.

01:20:42.430 --> 01:20:45.933
Then Lélia had a surprising idea.

01:20:46.059 --> 01:20:50.146
Why we not replant the forest that was here before?

01:20:52.901 --> 01:20:57.404
The forest that was here before and that covered these hills

01:20:57.529 --> 01:20:59.530
It was the Atlantic Forest.

01:20:59.656 --> 01:21:02.033
The Atlantic forest.

01:21:02.618 --> 01:21:04.912
No one had tried to replant.

01:21:05.413 --> 01:21:08.958
Let alone over 600 hectares.

01:21:09.543 --> 01:21:12.962
The suggestion came from his desire Lélia

01:21:13.088 --> 01:21:15.465
to maintain the spirit of the family.

01:21:15.590 --> 01:21:18.843
Anyway, they started using them

01:21:19.304 --> 01:21:21.638
and for the next 10 years

01:21:21.847 --> 01:21:26.352
what happened in that land was a miracle

01:21:26.478 --> 01:21:30.105
which it became, from that moment, the "Terra Institute".

01:21:36.780 --> 01:21:39.614
I remember during the first planting,

01:21:39.741 --> 01:21:43.536
sometimes dreamed that night was dying all.

01:21:45.330 --> 01:21:49.500
Because the soil was horrible. He was in such bad shape

01:21:49.627 --> 01:21:52.754
I wondered. Are the plants take root?

01:21:53.423 --> 01:21:57.468
In the Atlantic Forest there were 400 different species,

01:21:57.594 --> 01:22:00.514
we did not have 400,

01:22:00.639 --> 01:22:05.309
but just we planted 100 species, 150 ...

01:22:05.601 --> 01:22:09.814
It is true that the first planting lost 60%.

01:22:10.649 --> 01:22:13.652
In the second, 40.

01:22:13.777 --> 01:22:18.324
There were no books to teach to replant an Atlantic forest.

01:22:37.845 --> 01:22:39.804
I love coming here

01:22:40.349 --> 01:22:43.100
to see all these trees together.

01:22:43.352 --> 01:22:45.727
When you see this forest mass,

01:22:46.770 --> 01:22:50.733
an idea of ​​the effort involved in planting all this is done.

01:22:54.655 --> 01:22:56.322
When I was little,

01:22:56.656 --> 01:22:59.283
there was a small waterfall.

01:23:00.160 --> 01:23:03.080
All year, here was a waterfall that fell.

01:23:03.206 --> 01:23:08.042
I came with my sisters and we made a picnic under the jump.

01:23:08.878 --> 01:23:11.338
There was still a lot of forest.

01:23:11.715 --> 01:23:12.839
Then

01:23:13.299 --> 01:23:16.844
when felled trees, the water disappeared.

01:23:17.929 --> 01:23:21.265
Now our forest is young, needs lots of water.

01:23:23.226 --> 01:23:27.563
But within 10 or 15 years, when everything stabilizes,

01:23:27.689 --> 01:23:31.817
I'm sure it will reappear another beautiful waterfall.

01:23:53.716 --> 01:23:54.885
They are

01:23:55.929 --> 01:23:58.095
many small roads,

01:23:58.221 --> 01:24:00.641
hundreds of small ways ...

01:24:01.350 --> 01:24:03.226
Cows go there.

01:24:04.102 --> 01:24:08.482
Each leg of cow that sits on a small perimeter,

01:24:08.608 --> 01:24:11.944
They are 200 or 250 kilos of blow.

01:24:12.070 --> 01:24:15.573
Crushes the earth, the dry,

01:24:15.700 --> 01:24:17.575
and no longer sprout again nothing.

01:24:18.160 --> 01:24:21.037
It is very interesting to note the difference

01:24:21.705 --> 01:24:26.293
of what it was before the Terra Institute, smooth pastures like this

01:24:26.419 --> 01:24:29.712
and the other a fully recovered ecosystem.

01:24:29.839 --> 01:24:32.174
With ten million trees replanted.

01:24:54.407 --> 01:24:55.574
Here we see

01:24:55.825 --> 01:25:00.497
cicada singing until he dies.

01:25:01.163 --> 01:25:04.667
I'm sure it was not the tree.

01:25:04.793 --> 01:25:08.545
Are the termites that are assimilating.

01:25:08.672 --> 01:25:10.672
He will be buried here.

01:25:19.933 --> 01:25:24.647
Sometimes, just we look at a tree and think about its verticality, in its beauty.

01:25:24.773 --> 01:25:30.068
But everything depends on it, our water, our oxygen ...

01:25:30.194 --> 01:25:32.113
It is home to everyone.

01:25:32.572 --> 01:25:35.533
Ants, small insects, cicadas ...

01:25:35.659 --> 01:25:37.076
All are in the tree.

01:25:38.328 --> 01:25:42.665
It is very pleasant to touch a tree planting have helped.

01:25:43.084 --> 01:25:46.627
It is here, well established, well robust.

01:25:46.836 --> 01:25:50.215
Within 30 years it will be as well.

01:25:50.467 --> 01:25:53.302
He is still very young, is growing.

01:25:54.638 --> 01:25:57.766
Look, the youngest there, very young, here.

01:25:57.892 --> 01:25:59.725
They may have erupted tonight,

01:26:00.602 --> 01:26:03.688
like Alice entering the wonderland.

01:26:04.355 --> 01:26:09.402
And most incredible is that it will become a tree 40 to 50 meters.

01:26:09.528 --> 01:26:12.614
And who will live 400 years, 500 years.

01:26:12.740 --> 01:26:15.242
Here there is a great power.

01:26:19.831 --> 01:26:24.126
Think that these trees have three months

01:26:24.252 --> 01:26:26.587
and will reach its climax at the 400 ...

01:26:27.881 --> 01:26:32.426
Maybe we can measure from here

01:26:32.552 --> 01:26:34.721
the concept of eternity.

01:26:35.015 --> 01:26:37.390
Perhaps eternity can be measured.

01:26:40.353 --> 01:26:43.230
The first few days after saying: "We will plant a forest"

01:26:43.357 --> 01:26:48.276
I thought the route was a seed to a small tree, a plant ...

01:26:48.402 --> 01:26:51.572
and that's it, but there is only a little plant, but a million.

01:26:53.158 --> 01:26:54.658
And not just here.

01:26:54.785 --> 01:26:58.579
Also nearby. And more and more!

01:26:58.705 --> 01:27:02.042
And that's the most wonderful thing, this idea

01:27:04.087 --> 01:27:06.297
You may evolve, it can grow.

01:27:06.423 --> 01:27:09.674
He's not someone's idea, but of all.

01:27:11.553 --> 01:27:15.264
Sampling method can replicate almost everywhere.

01:27:15.390 --> 01:27:17.683
Of course, the species are not the same,

01:27:17.810 --> 01:27:20.561
but the way of acting is the same

01:27:21.146 --> 01:27:23.106
in all tropical forests.

01:27:36.330 --> 01:27:39.581
The land was the remedy to despair of Sebastião.

01:27:39.874 --> 01:27:44.628
The joy of seeing the trees grow, resurgent outbreaks,

01:27:45.047 --> 01:27:50.343
He resurrected Sebastião passion for photography.

01:27:50.843 --> 01:27:55.807
Although Lélia and he knew they could not return to their old ways.

01:27:56.226 --> 01:27:57.725
We conclude

01:27:57.852 --> 01:28:01.563
that would start a new photographic project on the environment.

01:28:01.773 --> 01:28:04.943
Of course, the first idea that came

01:28:05.069 --> 01:28:07.862
It was to denounce the destruction of forests,

01:28:07.987 --> 01:28:10.448
or pollution of the oceans,

01:28:10.700 --> 01:28:11.490
He did not care.

01:28:11.616 --> 01:28:15.578
Then gradually we start thinking. Let's do a different project.

01:28:16.246 --> 01:28:18.373
Let a tribute to the planet.

01:28:18.749 --> 01:28:21.293
And we discover with surprise

01:28:21.419 --> 01:28:24.254
nearly half of the planet

01:28:24.797 --> 01:28:26.798
continues as the day of Genesis.

01:28:29.677 --> 01:28:34.139
Many of my friends told me. "Do not get into that.

01:28:34.265 --> 01:28:38.018
It is very risky. You are a good human, social photographer,

01:28:38.144 --> 01:28:41.773
and now you will enter in the field

01:28:42.440 --> 01:28:45.902
Photographers landscapes, animals. "

01:28:46.029 --> 01:28:48.404
I said, "It's okay, I'm going for it!

01:28:48.530 --> 01:28:52.033
I will learn to photograph these things too. "

01:28:52.159 --> 01:28:54.077
And so I began the first story.

01:28:54.622 --> 01:28:57.038
Galapagos wanted it.

01:28:57.374 --> 01:29:02.169
Darwin wanted to understand what he understood.

01:29:03.213 --> 01:29:04.797
The same species,

01:29:04.923 --> 01:29:08.092
in very different ecosystems,

01:29:08.219 --> 01:29:10.512
They have evolved very differently.

01:29:13.058 --> 01:29:16.227
Looking at this detail of the leg of the iguana,

01:29:16.353 --> 01:29:19.355
I can not help thinking

01:29:19.856 --> 01:29:22.858
in the hand of a warrior of the Middle Ages.

01:29:23.109 --> 01:29:26.946
With its metal to protect shells.

01:29:30.117 --> 01:29:32.076
Looking at the structure of the hand,

01:29:32.202 --> 01:29:35.956
I see that the iguana is also my cousin,

01:29:36.499 --> 01:29:39.251
who we come from the same cell.

01:29:42.630 --> 01:29:46.841
We were facing a being of this age.

01:29:46.967 --> 01:29:48.761
We are dealing with an authority,

01:29:48.887 --> 01:29:51.681
with all its wrinkles, with all this knowledge.

01:29:52.432 --> 01:29:57.939
Certainly, when Darwin was here, that turtle was an adult.

01:29:58.564 --> 01:30:00.815
Maybe he saw Darwin. Who knows?

01:30:03.652 --> 01:30:05.736
I remember one time I was very tired

01:30:05.863 --> 01:30:11.201
because he had walked through lava fields for a long time.

01:30:11.328 --> 01:30:13.412
I had slept on the beach.

01:30:14.288 --> 01:30:17.248
I felt something touch my leg.

01:30:17.374 --> 01:30:20.044
I looked and it was a sea lion.

01:30:20.463 --> 01:30:22.463
Had another installed across.

01:30:22.589 --> 01:30:24.967
In the end, there were three sea lions.

01:30:25.676 --> 01:30:29.846
No man considered a predator, did not seem a threat.

01:30:32.184 --> 01:30:34.934
It was my first story of nature,

01:30:35.061 --> 01:30:38.356
the first time photographing animals.

01:30:41.944 --> 01:30:45.654
For 8 years, I had time to see ...

01:30:47.324 --> 01:30:49.367
and understand the most important thing.

01:30:49.492 --> 01:30:53.371
I am very nature as a turtle, like a tree,

01:30:53.497 --> 01:30:55.040
like a stone.

01:32:12.123 --> 01:32:14.373
His gaze remains extraordinary.

01:32:17.295 --> 01:32:19.213
It is very deep.

01:32:19.546 --> 01:32:22.382
I was up to me, I took a picture,

01:32:22.509 --> 01:32:23.925
he put his finger in the mouth ...

01:32:24.636 --> 01:32:28.137
He was looking for the first time in a mirror.

01:32:28.263 --> 01:32:30.015
I was in front of him

01:32:30.141 --> 01:32:33.018
and he removed his finger, put it.

01:32:33.144 --> 01:32:34.938
He began to understand that it was him.

01:32:35.064 --> 01:32:40.444
It was acknowledging his image. I felt completely identified.

01:32:54.877 --> 01:32:56.961
It's a family like ours,

01:32:57.087 --> 01:33:00.131
a grandfather, a father, children.

01:33:02.593 --> 01:33:05.720
They will respect each other, you know?

01:33:06.180 --> 01:33:10.726
And when you go, you have to respect their ways.

01:33:10.851 --> 01:33:13.521
You have to sit in a particular way,

01:33:13.647 --> 01:33:16.441
you have to respect their territory.

01:33:16.566 --> 01:33:19.026
And then you receive.

01:33:20.862 --> 01:33:23.989
I also became friends with a whale.

01:33:29.247 --> 01:33:30.580
These are whales.

01:33:32.125 --> 01:33:33.375
In Argentina.

01:33:36.129 --> 01:33:39.757
An adult as this measures 35 meters and weighs 40 tons, more or less.

01:33:41.008 --> 01:33:43.260
He was approaching, came to the ship.

01:33:43.387 --> 01:33:45.513
I could touch it.

01:33:45.639 --> 01:33:48.307
And it was amazing. That skin so sensitive!

01:33:48.433 --> 01:33:49.975
While he is stroking,

01:33:50.101 --> 01:33:54.522
He saw his tail shaking, at 35 meters.

01:33:54.648 --> 01:33:56.066
A phenomenal sensitivity.

01:33:56.901 --> 01:34:01.028
We had a small vessel of not more than seven meters.

01:34:01.781 --> 01:34:04.408
I knew that if we looked strong, we could sink.

01:34:04.534 --> 01:34:07.285
But he never touched the boat, never!

01:34:07.412 --> 01:34:10.457
Sometimes he walked away and hit the sea with its tail.

01:34:54.420 --> 01:34:59.091
Oh, it's another world, it's incredible.

01:34:59.217 --> 01:35:03.929
I'll see if I have another photo here of the Nenets.

01:35:05.099 --> 01:35:08.935
Check what does a Nenets.

01:35:10.521 --> 01:35:11.897
It's your house.

01:35:16.403 --> 01:35:20.155
I nenets this report with what was preparing a long time.

01:35:21.115 --> 01:35:25.327
Were 18 people and about 6,000 reindeer

01:35:25.453 --> 01:35:27.955
They are living in constant migration.

01:35:29.791 --> 01:35:32.793
Here should be the 7pm.

01:35:32.919 --> 01:35:36.048
About 8 light a fire

01:35:36.174 --> 01:35:38.967
and make the only hot meal of the day.

01:35:39.844 --> 01:35:43.221
After dinner, there are gatherings.

01:35:43.347 --> 01:35:44.807
And the fire goes out.

01:35:44.933 --> 01:35:50.688
While the fire burning is the temperature is pleasant: 15-20 degrees.

01:35:51.021 --> 01:35:53.650
Two hours later, it is already 30 below zero.

01:35:57.195 --> 01:36:00.197
They are real cowboys of Siberia.

01:36:00.324 --> 01:36:02.951
Always wear ties

01:36:03.077 --> 01:36:06.246
around the neck, made of reindeer skin.

01:36:07.207 --> 01:36:12.001
They wear leather boots with silver fox.

01:36:12.712 --> 01:36:16.341
Sleep with their boots. A boot lasts a lifetime.

01:36:31.607 --> 01:36:34.818
The Obi is a very special river,

01:36:34.945 --> 01:36:36.902
a large river in Siberia.

01:36:37.822 --> 01:36:41.533
This is about 47 kilometers long.

01:36:44.497 --> 01:36:48.750
When you pass the Obi, you enter the Arctic Circle.

01:36:50.836 --> 01:36:53.255
We have no horizon line, we have nothing.

01:36:53.381 --> 01:36:58.135
We are on a white plate on the size of the universe.

01:37:10.148 --> 01:37:13.568
Genesis made Sebastião again travel the world

01:37:13.943 --> 01:37:15.443
for nearly a decade.

01:37:16.113 --> 01:37:20.743
It was to show nature, animals, places and people

01:37:20.867 --> 01:37:23.703
They are living as the beginning of time.

01:37:23.829 --> 01:37:26.415
A more optimistic view of the same planet

01:37:26.541 --> 01:37:31.670
Sebastião had looked hurt and destroyed.

01:37:33.257 --> 01:37:36.175
Genesis was to be his great work.

01:37:36.302 --> 01:37:38.553
A love letter to the planet.

01:37:53.944 --> 01:37:57.029
Zo'é had representations in writings of the sixteenth century Jesuits

01:37:57.156 --> 01:38:00.618
Amazon coming and reported on a people

01:38:00.744 --> 01:38:03.829
who wore a kind of tube in the lower lip.

01:38:03.955 --> 01:38:07.207
These Indians never been seen.

01:38:07.334 --> 01:38:09.669
We thought it was a fable

01:38:09.795 --> 01:38:12.088
or an invention of the Jesuits,

01:38:12.215 --> 01:38:14.632
until the end of the forties,

01:38:14.926 --> 01:38:17.177
when we contacted them again.

01:38:17.761 --> 01:38:21.889
Estado de Paré, Brasil Tribe Zoe, 2009

01:39:47.148 --> 01:39:49.525
These Indians live in paradise.

01:39:50.694 --> 01:39:52.946
The only place I've seen in my life

01:39:53.072 --> 01:39:56.282
where women have 3, 4 or 5 husbands

01:39:56.867 --> 01:39:59.410
and many other women's husbands.

01:40:00.705 --> 01:40:02.747
The woman has a husband hunter,

01:40:03.249 --> 01:40:04.916
un fisherman husband,

Something that has always seemed very interesting to these peoples

01:40:58.724 --> 01:41:02.519
It is that the people had a full awareness of their image.

01:41:03.146 --> 01:41:05.148
When I was going to take a picture,

01:41:05.774 --> 01:41:09.610

01:41:43.647 --> 01:41:46.192
