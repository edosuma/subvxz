We were all confused.

07:31.160 --> 07:33.116
And we found each other.

for personal gain.

that we'd done was...

08:00.898 --> 08:02.763

one person at a time
was just not enough.

down on course.

hope, but they trust fear.

08:49.154 --> 08:50.530

15:49.324 --> 15:52.657
I regret a lot of the choices
I've made in my life.

15:53.078 --> 15:56.036
You're getting the benefit
of my experience.

15:57.916 --> 15:59.907

these pages right away,
so I called my best messenger.

16:37.747 --> 16:39.829
Oh, man,
the new 9th Wonders!

16:39.916 --> 16:42.749
I've been dying to find out
what happens to Hiro.

16:42.836 --> 16:44.827
The latest and the last.

16:46.173 --> 16:47.253
Last?

16:47.841 --> 16:49.377
Looks that way.

16:49.926 --> 16:51.757
Why? What do you mean?

16:52.220 --> 16:53.721
Never mind.

16:54.639 --> 16:57.176
So what happens
to Hiro in this one?

16:57.767 --> 17:00.509
You promise you won't
post any spoilers?

17:02.314 --> 17:03.679

17:04.399 --> 17:06.765
How do you come up
with this stuff?

17:06.860 --> 17:08.270
It's a gift.

17:08.528 --> 17:10.314
Speaking of which...

17:16.203 --> 17:17.784
Your sketchbook?

17:18.496 --> 17:19.622
Are you serious?

17:19.706 --> 17:23.619
Hold on to it.
It might be worth
something someday.

17:25.503 --> 17:26.834

Everything I've done,
I've done for Micah.

17:43.730 --> 17:45.516
You keep telling
yourself that.

17:45.607 --> 17:48.565
Hey, if it wasn't for me,
Niki would still be in prison

17:48.652 --> 17:52.065
and Micah wouldn't
have a mother,
and you'd be all alone.

17:53.907 --> 17:55.192
I don't remember
you complaining.

17:55.283 --> 17:58.195
Niki, Jessica, whoever
the hell you are, I'm done.

17:58.286 --> 17:59.401
I'm taking Micah,

finish that sentence.

He's not safe as long as
Linderman owns our lives.

18:03.833 --> 18:06.415
Not as long as you're around.
Look at what you
brought into our house.

18:06.503 --> 18:07.993
What, money?

18:08.797 --> 18:09.877
Rent?

18:10.173 --> 18:11.379
Poor me.

18:12.008 --> 18:14.545
Nobody wants
to hire a black ex-con.

18:19.641 --> 18:21.848
Hell, you didn't turn
into Jessica.

18:21.935 --> 18:24.142
You turned into your old man.

18:24.646 --> 18:25.635
Don't you dare.

18:25.730 --> 18:28.847
I'll die before I let you do
to Micah what he did to you.

18:28.942 --> 18:30.398

18:31.403 --> 18:34.315
Mr. Linderman has asked
to see you right away.

18:36.199 --> 18:40.158
If this is the life you want,
you need to get
Micah out of it.

18:43.164 --> 18:45.371
You can say goodbye tonight.

You’ll see an exit door

We're moving Bennet,
Sprague, and Parkman.

19:08.440 --> 19:11.477
Now make sure
you gas Sprague's room
before you put the IV in him.

19:11.568 --> 19:13.934
I don't want that man
so much as dreaming.

19:14.029 --> 19:15.269
What about Parkman?

19:15.363 --> 19:17.069
Put some tape on his mouth.

Go? How did you
even get in here?

19:42.265 --> 19:43.801
Bennet, he's got a plan.

19:43.892 --> 19:47.055
Bennet?
Were you listening to him?

19:47.145 --> 19:48.555
He told me to come get you.

19:48.646 --> 19:50.853
He could be leading you right
where he wants you to go.

I'm so sorry. It's Peter.

20:21.096 --> 20:23.382
I found this address
in his wallet.

20:23.473 --> 20:25.964
I didn't know
where else to go.
I couldn't leave him.

20:26.059 --> 20:28.141
He's... He's dead.

20:30.563 --> 20:32.849
He was killed. Murdered,

20:34.317 --> 20:36.228
trying to save my life.

20:38.154 --> 20:41.442
I was in over my head and I...
Get out of here.

I'm sorry.

20:46.413 --> 20:48.995

You're kidding.

21:31.499 --> 21:33.706
Linderman doesn't see anyone.

21:33.793 --> 21:36.034
LINDERMAN: Not if
I can help it.

21:36.629 --> 21:38.665
Fearsome Jessica, finally.

21:39.048 --> 21:41.209
Sweet Niki, yes, but you.

21:41.718 --> 21:43.128
I never had the pleasure.

21:43.219 --> 21:44.925
Hmm, you were due.

21:45.346 --> 21:48.759
Well, we've both certainly
come a long way, haven't we,

21:48.850 --> 21:53.935
since you borrowed
that $30,000 and conveniently
forgot to repay?

21:54.022 --> 21:57.514
Oh, by the way, I've had
to have that room repainted

21:57.609 --> 21:59.725
since your last assignment.

22:00.904 --> 22:02.394
What is this?

22:04.491 --> 22:06.106
I need a small favor.

22:06.201 --> 22:09.443
You're Linderman.
When you need something,
you send your boys.

22:09.537 --> 22:12.028
When it's something big,
you send lawyers.

22:12.123 --> 22:13.624
This must be off the charts.

22:13.708 --> 22:16.415
It's all a matter
of perspective.

22:16.503 --> 22:19.040
I need to borrow
your Micah briefly.

22:19.255 --> 22:20.415
Borrow?

22:20.632 --> 22:22.918
Yeah, I mean, well,
that is, his talent.

22:23.009 --> 22:27.252
I want to help Micah
achieve something
monumental in his life.

22:27.889 --> 22:31.723
I had a plan in place that,
until recently,
began to unravel.

22:31.976 --> 22:34.183
I need your son
to help me repair it.

22:34.270 --> 22:36.522
Micah wasn't part of our deal.

22:36.940 --> 22:38.680
I don't want him
involved in all this.

22:38.775 --> 22:42.609
Understand, Micah is involved
by the mere fact of his birth.

22:43.363 --> 22:46.776
Now, I've been, I think,
more than fair to you.

22:46.866 --> 22:49.027
I mean, I helped you
out of a tough spot,

22:49.118 --> 22:51.825
spared you that long walk
to the gas chamber, even.

22:51.913 --> 22:53.119
So,

22:53.706 --> 22:58.040
a chocolate milk,
all the cookies he can eat,
and I'll tell you what.

a fresh sandwich myself.

it's not radioactive.

how to do that.

"Don't burn hot, burn bright."
Don’t burn hot, burn bright.

29:45.826 --> 29:47.202
We need her.

29:55.962 --> 29:59.705
About what just happened,
Nathan and I need
to talk to you.

30:01.092 --> 30:02.878
It's okay, I know.

30:04.512 --> 30:07.094
I knew long before
either of you did.

30:12.395 --> 30:14.477
I recommend the cherry pie.

30:14.689 --> 30:16.145
Shouldn't we keep
a low profile?

30:16.232 --> 30:18.689
They won't come after us
in a public place.
They wouldn't risk it.

30:18.776 --> 30:20.562
How can you be so sure?

30:22.738 --> 30:24.148
Point taken.

30:24.240 --> 30:26.572
Eat up.
It's a long road ahead.

30:26.659 --> 30:28.399
Forget it. I'm getting
the hell out of here.

30:28.494 --> 30:30.030
They will find you.

30:30.121 --> 30:33.488
As long as they have
that tracking system,
you'll never be safe.

30:33.582 --> 30:35.368
Neither will Claire.

30:36.460 --> 30:37.575
Look.

30:38.754 --> 30:42.338
The system is
well protected, but we can
get to it, destroy it.

30:42.425 --> 30:44.757
No more bagging and tagging.
No more looking
over your shoulder.

30:44.844 --> 30:46.084
We can end it all.

30:46.178 --> 30:48.009
Where is this tracking system?

30:48.097 --> 30:49.587
New York City.

30:50.099 --> 30:52.260
We're leaving on the next bus.

30:52.351 --> 30:54.433
Is this where Linderman is?

30:55.604 --> 30:57.515
Where did you get that name?

30:57.606 --> 30:58.937
From your boss, Thompson.

30:59.025 --> 31:01.141
He was thinking about
sending us to go see
this Linderman guy.

31:01.235 --> 31:04.068
I just figured that must be
who you're working for.

31:04.155 --> 31:05.645
Wait a minute.

31:08.117 --> 31:09.948
You didn't know that?

31:10.036 --> 31:11.116
(LAUGHS)

31:11.203 --> 31:13.114
You're trying to take
down your organization.

31:13.205 --> 31:15.742
You don't even know
who signs your checks?

31:15.833 --> 31:17.164
(LAUGHING)

31:18.502 --> 31:19.878
Oh, my God.

31:20.463 --> 31:21.748
You're middle management!

31:21.839 --> 31:22.828
So what's this
supposed to mean?

31:22.923 --> 31:25.209
What it means is
he's a schlub
just like the rest of us.

31:25.301 --> 31:28.589
Linderman isn't in New York.
He's in Las Vegas.

31:28.929 --> 31:32.171
So this is really Linderman,
Linderman, the mobster
who owns all those casinos?

31:32.266 --> 31:33.381
What does he have
to do with all of this?

31:33.476 --> 31:35.307
Apparently more than I knew.

31:35.394 --> 31:37.259
I say we go to Vegas.
We take the fight
to Linderman.

31:37.354 --> 31:39.515
No. We stick with the plan.

31:39.607 --> 31:41.472
We take out
the tracking system.

31:41.567 --> 31:44.650
And then whoever's
left standing can go
after Linderman.

31:46.322 --> 31:47.607
New York?

31:49.867 --> 31:51.858
I've always wanted to go.

31:52.912 --> 31:54.868
You boys ready to order?

31:55.915 --> 31:58.577
But why'd you have
to pick me up so early
today from school?

31:58.667 --> 32:00.532
Today's a special day.

32:03.089 --> 32:04.169
Mom?

32:08.677 --> 32:10.633
The man we're gonna meet...

32:10.721 --> 32:14.760
Well, Iet'sjust say
he changes all the rules.

32:14.850 --> 32:16.351
And he wants to meet me?

32:16.435 --> 32:18.812
He knows that you do
the most amazing things.

32:18.896 --> 32:22.434
I told him he doesn't
know the half of it.
My son, the genius.

32:22.525 --> 32:25.858
So I don't have to pretend
about what we can do,
like Dad said?

32:25.945 --> 32:27.856
That's all right, gentlemen.

32:27.947 --> 32:30.563
I want to greet
this young man myself.

32:33.661 --> 32:36.778
It's a great pleasure
to meet you, Micah.

32:36.997 --> 32:38.328
Thank you.

32:38.541 --> 32:41.408
How would you like
to save the world today?

32:45.798 --> 32:47.038
(CHUCKUNG)

33:11.115 --> 33:12.400
Cute car.

33:17.037 --> 33:19.653
You know why
Peter Petrelli came here?

33:19.748 --> 33:21.204
He wanted my help.

33:21.292 --> 33:23.328
Instead, I got him killed.

33:23.878 --> 33:26.335
THOMPSON: You did
the right thing calling us.

33:26.422 --> 33:28.287
I tried to stop Sylar.

33:29.216 --> 33:30.922
But I couldn't.
I'm a scientist.

33:31.010 --> 33:33.547
I can't fight someone who
defies the laws of physics.

33:33.637 --> 33:34.888
You can.

33:35.931 --> 33:37.637
You just need help.

33:38.058 --> 33:39.434
You're not the one I called.

33:39.518 --> 33:41.258
Glasses, tall fella?

33:42.563 --> 33:44.679
He's no longer
with the company.

33:44.773 --> 33:48.561
You know, you've been
going about this
all wrong, Professor.

33:49.069 --> 33:52.061
Trying to take on
the science and the killer
all on your own?

33:52.156 --> 33:56.820
What you're dealing with,
no man should face
without friends.

33:58.162 --> 33:59.948
Now, we can provide you
with the resources...

34:00.039 --> 34:01.779
I didn't call
about my research.

34:01.874 --> 34:04.741
The man who murdered
my father and Peter Petrelli,
he's still out there.

34:04.835 --> 34:07.212
That takes precedence
over any academics.

34:07.296 --> 34:09.082
A person that dangerous
must be stopped.

34:09.173 --> 34:12.131
I can assure you
we have similar priorities.

34:12.801 --> 34:16.965
The best way to stop Sylar
is for us to work together.

34:28.484 --> 34:31.021
SYLAR: You really can
paint the future.

34:31.320 --> 34:34.232
Just like the professor said.
Fantastic.

34:35.866 --> 34:37.276
You're late.

34:39.453 --> 34:41.660
I guess you know why I'm here.

34:43.624 --> 34:45.239
You're the one
who's gonna kill me.

34:45.334 --> 34:46.744
That's true.

34:50.673 --> 34:54.086
This is usually the part
when people start screaming.

34:54.802 --> 34:56.918
I tried fighting the future.

34:57.721 --> 34:59.507
It's too big for me.

35:00.432 --> 35:01.763
Maybe you can do better.

35:01.850 --> 35:03.056
Why me?

35:04.228 --> 35:06.844
Do you see some
special future for me?

35:08.482 --> 35:09.983
They stop you

35:10.818 --> 35:12.183
and you die.

35:12.987 --> 35:14.648
(CHUCKLES)

35:15.698 --> 35:17.689
You painted all that, too?

35:18.701 --> 35:19.941
Show me.

35:21.704 --> 35:23.194
Show me.

35:27.710 --> 35:28.950
Now, now.

35:30.796 --> 35:31.876
(GRUNTS)

35:33.090 --> 35:34.671
(SCREAMING)

35:39.096 --> 35:40.757
It's already gone.

35:41.432 --> 35:44.174
Why don't you tell me
all about it then?

35:45.227 --> 35:46.967
I've seen enough
of the future.

35:47.062 --> 35:49.394
I don't need
to watch it happen.

35:52.735 --> 35:56.603
I've wasted my life,
destroyed everything good
that ever came to me.

35:58.198 --> 36:01.110
At least I did one
good thing before I died.

36:02.077 --> 36:03.487
(SCREAMING)

36:06.206 --> 36:09.118
You can't fight the future.

36:10.627 --> 36:12.242
Neither can you.

36:16.550 --> 36:18.131
It's all right.

36:19.261 --> 36:22.128
I finally know
my part in all of this.

36:22.264 --> 36:24.676
To die here with you.

36:27.186 --> 36:30.098
But not before
I show them how to kill you

36:30.773 --> 36:32.434
and stop the bomb.

36:34.109 --> 36:36.316
I finally get to be a hero.

36:47.164 --> 36:49.120
(ISAAC SCREAMING)

37:11.438 --> 37:13.019
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

37:14.400 --> 37:17.107
Your mom said
you wanted to talk to me.

37:17.694 --> 37:20.231
I did. I do.
Come in, please.

37:28.080 --> 37:32.164
This should have happened
a long time ago
under better circumstances.

37:32.543 --> 37:36.411
It shouldn't take someone
nearly dying for the two of us
to finally meet.

37:36.505 --> 37:38.666
You know,
you don't have to do this,

37:38.757 --> 37:40.622
pretend to be nice to me.

37:40.717 --> 37:42.457
I'm not pretending.

37:43.762 --> 37:45.718
Claire, most people...

37:46.598 --> 37:49.214
They think the worst of me,
and I've probably given them
good reason to,

37:49.309 --> 37:51.265
but I want to do better.

37:52.020 --> 37:54.147
I want to be there for you.

37:57.067 --> 37:58.477
But I can't.

38:00.195 --> 38:01.401
Not now.

38:02.531 --> 38:03.646
Of course.

38:03.740 --> 38:05.731
I'm sorry, but there are
things happening right now

38:05.826 --> 38:08.363
that I can't expect you
to understand.

38:09.872 --> 38:12.204
I barely understand
them myself.

38:12.749 --> 38:18.289
I got into politics
for the chance
to do something good.

38:20.048 --> 38:23.632
I have a chance to help,
to be a part of something big.

38:24.386 --> 38:27.549
But in order to do that,
I have to...
The election.

38:28.640 --> 38:30.596
You can't have some
illegitimate daughter

38:30.684 --> 38:33.050
popping up and waving
at the cameras.

38:33.145 --> 38:34.635
I need to win.

38:35.814 --> 38:37.600
You need me to leave.

38:39.026 --> 38:41.108
Paris, with my grandmother.

38:42.571 --> 38:44.186
She warms up.

38:45.407 --> 38:46.613
Sort of.

38:47.534 --> 38:49.240
It's just one week.

38:49.912 --> 38:51.402
And then what?

38:57.753 --> 39:00.415
And then you come home
to your family.

39:02.382 --> 39:03.462
Okay?
