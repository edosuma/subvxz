Can we talk?

03:33.839 --> 03:35.047
About what?

03:37.051 --> 03:40.052
You're right. I lied.

03:40.095 --> 03:43.055
I've been telling people
I'm 28 for the last four years.

03:48.145 --> 03:49.945
Women age out quickly
in a business like this.

03:53.400 --> 03:54.419
I ran the wrong birth date.

03:54.443 --> 03:55.443
Yeah, you did.

03:59.657 --> 04:01.301
I know you're going
through a lot right now.

04:01.325 --> 04:04.034
I just wanted to... I was an ass for
running it in the first place.

04:08.249 --> 04:10.290
Sorry.

04:10.334 --> 04:11.334
Are you?

04:13.879 --> 04:15.399
I get paranoid
when people get close.

04:17.423 --> 04:17.923
It's a reflex.

04:17.966 --> 04:20.676
It's a bad one.

04:20.719 --> 04:23.011
But... I forgive you for it.

Yeah, I know, man.-

05:17.651 --> 05:18.691
- Think about it, alright?

05:19.361 --> 05:21.361
You hungry?

05:21.405 --> 05:22.988
Another time.

05:25.326 --> 05:27.451

06:17.211 --> 06:18.211
No.

06:21.507 --> 06:23.006
Karen. Your mom...

06:24.927 --> 06:26.167
I don't want to talk about t.

06:30.808 --> 06:32.599
You know, picking at old wounds,

06:32.643 --> 06:35.102
it never helped anyone.

06:35.145 --> 06:38.021
The only thing it does is keep.

06:40.901 --> 06:41.274
What would youlike to talk abo?

06:41.318 --> 06:42.984
Not her!

07:01.797 --> 07:03.077
You don't know what it was like.

07:05.509 --> 07:07.008
I don't have to.

07:08.512 --> 07:09.512
This is about you.

07:13.183 --> 07:15.016
I'm afraid of whatl'll do if I.

07:20.983 --> 07:22.232
How do you make peace with soy

07:22.276 --> 07:23.984
when all you want to dois punch?

07:25.696 --> 07:27.446
We should talk about that.

07:30.492 --> 07:32.534
But...

07:32.578 --> 07:33.578
maybe on another day.

07:39.793 --> 07:42.711
It's my last mandated session.

07:42.754 --> 07:44.074
Doesn't mean you haveto stop c.

09:04.086 --> 09:05.366
But he sure as hellisn't here,.

09:09.424 --> 09:11.466

You see his body?

10:55.197 --> 10:56.029
Nah.

10:56.073 --> 10:58.281
Ramos, blood trail?

10:58.325 --> 10:59.325

Yo, yo, yo, we gotta get outta he

11:12.464 --> 11:13.588
I want him dead!

11:13.632 --> 11:14.632
Hamm, we gotta go now!

11:32.067 --> 11:32.899
Did you try and work him?

11:32.943 --> 11:35.819
He's not willing to play ball.

11:35.862 --> 11:37.006
Did you usethe sons as leverag?

11:37.030 --> 11:38.530
Yes, he saw right through it.

11:38.573 --> 11:42.534
Look, we're not gonna close up.

11:42.577 --> 11:45.203
This one guy can cause usmore.

11:45.247 --> 11:49.249
Witnesses at the scenesaw three.

11:49.292 --> 11:52.001
One Caucasianand one AfricanAm.

11:54.464 --> 11:55.588
Steve and Cole?

11:55.632 --> 11:56.798
He's calling the shots

11:56.842 --> 11:58.122
and his sonsare falling in line.

12:01.596 --> 12:05.140
Besides a fewshaky witness rep,

12:05.183 --> 12:06.725
is there forensic evidence th?

12:06.768 --> 12:08.017
No, but we can't ignore this.

12:11.648 --> 12:13.273
Bring 'em in for questioning.

12:13.316 --> 12:15.483
If we do that, it's gonna raise.

12:15.527 --> 12:17.026
Then do it quietly.

12:17.070 --> 12:20.071
This is a serious problem, and.

12:20.115 --> 12:23.908
We are at a pointof diminishing.

12:23.952 --> 12:25.994
End it before things really go.

12:32.919 --> 12:35.837
You think it could have been?

12:35.881 --> 12:38.423
No, this wasorganized and clea.

12:38.467 --> 12:41.050
Besides, Tomwouldn't make a moe

12:41.094 --> 12:42.510
without talking to youor Cole f?

12:42.554 --> 12:45.013
Nope.-Not necessarily.

12:49.519 --> 12:50.519
What's that mean?

12:58.945 --> 13:00.987
I told Tom aboutour deal with.

13:03.033 --> 13:04.824
Why would you do that?!

13:04.868 --> 13:06.284
Because he's gotshit for brain.

13:06.328 --> 13:07.076
I had to!

13:07.120 --> 13:09.829
He was gonna kill Byrd.

13:09.873 --> 13:10.747
You shouldn'thave said anythin.

13:10.791 --> 13:12.916
And who are you to talk?

13:12.959 --> 13:14.584
You screwed us over just to prot

13:14.628 --> 13:15.628
your goddamn boyfriend.

13:24.471 --> 13:25.637
Where you going?

13:25.680 --> 13:27.013
To tell Byrd that Tom knows.

13:27.057 --> 13:29.057
And you realizethey'll put him.

13:31.728 --> 13:33.603
For him, it's the safest place.

13:33.647 --> 13:35.063
You believe that shit?

13:35.106 --> 13:38.024
Then you're as much as an assh.

13:40.904 --> 13:43.988
Cole, you don'towe him anythin.

13:44.032 --> 13:47.242
Yeah, he adopted you, but he did.

13:47.285 --> 13:48.285
Mom did.

13:49.996 --> 13:53.039
Well, right now, he's the only.

13:54.876 --> 13:56.251
Family looks outfor each other.

13:56.294 --> 13:58.002
Where is he?

14:00.215 --> 14:02.966
At some point, you're gonna have.

14:03.009 --> 14:04.289
Tom only cares aboutwhat's best.

14:08.557 --> 14:09.557
You're wrong, man.

14:15.897 --> 14:16.604
Tom's probablyblowing up our dl

14:16.648 --> 14:17.688
with the Feds as we speak.

14:22.529 --> 14:23.570
Where are you going?

14:23.613 --> 14:24.863
None of your business.

14:24.906 --> 14:26.406
You're thinkingabout running, ?

14:26.449 --> 14:29.033
It's better than staying here.

14:29.077 --> 14:30.077
What about Hammond?
-

14:33.164 --> 14:34.664
You know, we keepfollowing Hammd

14:34.708 --> 14:35.788
and it keeps going to shit.

14:39.045 --> 14:40.325
It's time for usto look out for.

14:51.600 --> 14:53.016
You wanted to see me?

14:54.769 --> 14:56.936
Start closing up your 302's.

14:56.980 --> 14:59.522
I thought the SAC wantsto keep.

14:59.566 --> 15:00.690
He changed his mind.

15:00.734 --> 15:02.003
Was there some new development?

15:02.027 --> 15:04.986
What the hell do you care? Y.

15:06.114 --> 15:08.948
What about the Ravens?

15:08.992 --> 15:10.177
They're going downlike everybo.

15:10.201 --> 15:11.618
Reduced sentencesif they're luc.

15:11.661 --> 15:12.952
"If they're lucky"?

15:12.996 --> 15:15.705
The deal was we cut thema break.

15:15.749 --> 15:17.582
They're corrupt cops, Damon.

15:17.626 --> 15:19.626
We wrap things up here,

15:19.669 --> 15:20.709
and then we bring them in.

15:22.505 --> 15:24.005
Is that gonna bea problem for y?

15:26.217 --> 15:27.217
No.

15:39.314 --> 15:41.773
Hello?

15:41.816 --> 15:42.440
It's over.

15:42.484 --> 15:43.983
I'm coming home.

15:46.237 --> 15:47.237
When?

15:49.699 --> 15:50.990
Two days, three the most.

15:57.165 --> 15:58.405
Believe me, I was just as shoc.

16:04.923 --> 16:06.203
Anyway, I'm donewith the field.

16:07.550 --> 16:09.008
I'm putting in anapplication fo.

16:11.054 --> 16:13.054
They're looking to place me som.

16:19.479 --> 16:20.979
You still there?

16:22.232 --> 16:23.898
Yeah.

16:26.069 --> 16:27.389
Look, maybe noneof this change.

16:30.782 --> 16:32.062
But I couldn't wait to tell you.

16:42.877 --> 16:44.197
Henry has beenasking about you.

16:47.340 --> 16:49.007
Yeah?

16:51.469 --> 16:52.469
He misses you.

16:56.683 --> 16:58.016
I can't wait to see him.

17:06.734 --> 17:07.935
Call me when you land, okay?

17:08.236 --> 17:09.986
Yeah.

17:12.240 --> 17:13.240
Bye.

17:25.295 --> 17:29.422
- The FDA is the le.
- Winters:

17:29.466 --> 17:31.257
I make the decisions about thi,

17:31.301 --> 17:33.509
not you.

17:33.553 --> 17:36.637
Sure, it's enough,

17:36.681 --> 17:37.638
but I think we can do better.

17:37.682 --> 17:39.807
Man, this dickhead runs a comy

17:39.851 --> 17:41.684
that's gonna beworth millions.

17:41.728 --> 17:43.269
Don't get better than that.

17:43.313 --> 17:45.855
You have him on video meeting.

17:45.899 --> 17:47.857
That is a lot of people with ds

17:47.901 --> 17:48.858
who could standto lose if this.

17:48.902 --> 17:49.920
We're not double dipping. Come.

17:49.944 --> 17:51.986
Why not?-It's too risky.

17:56.993 --> 18:01.037
You are thinkingof this like a,

18:01.081 --> 18:02.997
when this could beone hell of a.

18:10.215 --> 18:12.006
I don't know. I could use a bitm.

18:21.643 --> 18:24.727
Why don't you hold off

18:24.771 --> 18:26.979
on makingany more moves...

18:29.859 --> 18:31.139
until I come upwith a game plan?

18:50.255 --> 18:51.357
I need to tell you something.

18:51.381 --> 18:54.757
Wait. Before you do, we got a.

18:54.801 --> 18:55.861
Do you people have eyes on Tom?

18:55.885 --> 18:57.135
Why?

18:57.178 --> 18:59.929
Because he knows aboutthe RICO.

18:59.973 --> 19:01.305
Shit.

19:01.349 --> 19:03.099
How the hell did he find out?

19:04.269 --> 19:06.894
Relax.

19:06.938 --> 19:08.218
I don't thinkhe'll blow our cov.

19:10.775 --> 19:11.836
Price probablywon't give a shi.

19:11.860 --> 19:14.861

19:20.076 --> 19:22.451

19:23.496 --> 19:25.580
To hell with this!

Who's assignedthis black and w?

21:42.218 --> 21:43.538
It's one of yours fromSouth St.

21:55.023 --> 21:57.606
We're throwing a netover the c.

21:57.650 --> 21:58.983
At 0500, three separateteams wir

21:59.027 --> 22:04.030
on key members of the Vipers,.

22:04.073 --> 22:05.781
We're not bringingthe informan?

22:05.825 --> 22:06.969
Our UC is still in play in the.

22:06.993 --> 22:08.178
We're holding backuntil we can.

22:08.202 --> 22:10.953
Trust me. They're goingdown too.

22:10.997 --> 22:15.166
So we tip our handand then go?

22:15.209 --> 22:17.710
We've included copiesof our su,

22:17.754 --> 22:20.171
listing their service weapons.

22:20.214 --> 22:22.506
That doesn't mean that'sthe onl.

22:22.550 --> 22:24.008
Any other questions?

22:25.720 --> 22:27.720
Alright, let's play it safe.

22:27.764 --> 22:29.847
Remember, your perps are cops.

22:29.891 --> 22:31.349
They're armed. They know the dri.

22:31.392 --> 22:32.392
Be careful.

22:39.525 --> 22:40.941
Nothing from Byrd?

22:40.985 --> 22:42.985
He isn't answering his cell.

22:45.073 --> 22:47.490
I don't like the waythis is go.

22:47.533 --> 22:50.326
We have it in hand.

22:50.370 --> 22:52.703
I hope so,

22:52.747 --> 22:54.705
because if this goes sideways,

22:54.749 --> 22:55.998
I'm not taking the heat alone.

23:04.300 --> 23:07.385
[R]The cellular custom.

23:24.862 --> 23:25.986
The last time we spoke..

23:29.158 --> 23:30.358
You said you would kill me if.

23:33.579 --> 23:34.579
Do you remember that?

23:36.249 --> 23:37.998
Yeah.

23:41.379 --> 23:43.587
And I said,

23:43.631 --> 23:45.005
you'd probably have to.

23:58.521 --> 23:59.521
Let me qualify that.

24:06.612 --> 24:08.946
If you and your friends

24:08.990 --> 24:10.656
don't tell meeverything I need w

24:10.700 --> 24:11.780
before the night is done...

24:13.911 --> 24:15.180
you are goingto beg me to kill.

24:15.204 --> 24:19.123
Just to stop the pain.

24:19.167 --> 24:22.001
Vasily, you're makinga huge mi.

Where I come from, cops are h.

24:38.561 --> 24:39.561
Cheap help at that.

24:41.647 --> 24:43.814
I see no difference here.

24:43.858 --> 24:45.566
They're tracking our phon.

24:45.610 --> 24:47.776
Probably already on us.

24:47.820 --> 24:49.060
Cut your losses, and walk away.

24:51.032 --> 24:53.032
You're saying we don't?

24:55.369 --> 24:57.995
Okay, okay.

25:03.503 --> 25:05.002
Let's get started.

25:18.309 --> 25:22.019
I need to know everything you.

25:22.063 --> 25:23.263
Starting with the house by th.

25:24.732 --> 25:25.981
That was your boy Kilvinsky.

25:30.071 --> 25:31.351
I thought you already plugged t.

25:34.492 --> 25:35.991
Kilvinsky died...

25:40.581 --> 25:41.581
and the case remained.

25:43.960 --> 25:46.293
That tells mehe wasn't the info.

25:46.337 --> 25:48.003
You were.

25:52.468 --> 25:53.468
You're fishing.

26:11.862 --> 26:13.182
For every answerl don't like...

26:13.990 --> 26:15.990
I'm going to take a finger.

26:17.451 --> 26:18.993
You understand?

26:20.496 --> 26:21.496
Choose carefully.

26:27.920 --> 26:29.240
You don't want to run out of fin.

26:35.011 --> 26:38.053
I don't know who you are, or wh.

26:43.936 --> 26:45.519
Yeah, that's right. Be an as.

26:45.563 --> 26:47.646
But here's the deal.

Winters recorded everybody.

26:50.067 --> 26:51.347
She was a big believerin insura.

33:48.569 --> 33:49.985
I put my hands on you.

33:52.698 --> 33:55.949
I shouldn't have done that.

33:55.993 --> 33:57.313
And then I put mine right back.

34:32.946 --> 34:35.197
Maybe I've been askingmy quest.

If we were with the Feds,

34:40.704 --> 34:42.329
