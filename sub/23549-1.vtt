00:09.680 --> 00:11.960
[girl] Many centuries before I was born,

00:12.800 --> 00:14.360
gods ruled the world.

00:15.640 --> 00:17.000
The demons were kept at bay.

00:18.400 --> 00:19.640
There was peace.

00:21.840 --> 00:24.200
The Monkey King was born into this age.

00:26.920 --> 00:29.760
Some say he was the mightiest
of all the gods,

00:30.600 --> 00:33.320
with powers and skills beyond imagining.

00:34.640 --> 00:37.360
But then, everything changed.

00:39.120 --> 00:41.400
The Monkey King was lost,

00:41.480 --> 00:44.920
banished by his enemies, never to return.

00:55.800 --> 00:59.480
All goodness was forced into hiding,
and the demons took over.

01:03.560 --> 01:07.200
Five hundreds years later, chaos reigns.

01:09.200 --> 01:10.800
The gods are gone.

01:13.320 --> 01:15.280
But I believe in the Monkey King.

01:25.000 --> 01:28.520
Sometimes, when you've waited
for something your whole life,

01:29.240 --> 01:31.200
when it arrives, you feel scared.

01:32.960 --> 01:34.760
The warriors are here.

01:35.680 --> 01:37.960
It is time to find the Monkey King.

01:43.720 --> 01:45.360
Welcome. My name is...

01:47.320 --> 01:49.920
Uh, we are so very excited to...

01:50.000 --> 01:51.160
Oh.

01:51.240 --> 01:52.760
Okay, I'm not actually...

01:54.720 --> 01:56.520
[sighs] a servant.

01:57.480 --> 02:02.800
[Gaxin chanting] Na ninekah alookah
enumbah kudantai calaporeekah.

02:06.560 --> 02:08.199
[thunder rumbling]

02:10.600 --> 02:12.920
Our world is at its darkest point.

02:13.680 --> 02:18.760
The demon forces rule us,
and our gods are all dead or in hiding.

02:19.320 --> 02:21.240
What can you tell me of the Monkey King?

02:21.320 --> 02:24.560
[Gaxin] Monkey was protector of the gods
and an exceptional fighter.

02:24.640 --> 02:26.640
He could summon a cloud and fly on it,

02:26.720 --> 02:27.920
duplicate himself into an army,

02:28.000 --> 02:29.600
shrink himself
to the size of an ant at will.

02:29.680 --> 02:32.040
He was destroyed centuries ago.

02:32.120 --> 02:34.720
What is myth and what is truth?

02:39.400 --> 02:41.680
This is the Monkey King's crown.

02:42.680 --> 02:46.400
Some of the ancient records claim
the demons didn't kill Monkey,

02:46.480 --> 02:48.960
but rather... buried him in stone.

02:49.040 --> 02:54.480
It has taken a lifetime of searching,
but we believe he is here, in this valley.

02:54.560 --> 02:56.520
-Now, your mission--
-[teapot clangs]

02:58.280 --> 02:59.280
Sorry.

03:04.720 --> 03:06.240
Uh, are you finished with this?

03:07.960 --> 03:09.880
[dishes clattering]

03:11.160 --> 03:12.240
Thank you for the tea.

03:12.880 --> 03:14.560
Go and do your study now, please.

03:17.840 --> 03:22.240
Your mission is to help us find Monkey
and release him with the crown.

03:22.320 --> 03:23.760
And once he is released?

03:23.840 --> 03:28.800
[scholar] You must find the sacred scrolls
and bring them to the Western Mountains.

03:28.880 --> 03:29.880
Here.

03:30.720 --> 03:34.680
Only with the scrolls can we defeat
the evil that has besieged our world.

03:35.160 --> 03:39.800
From tonight, Gaxin,
you will receive a new name.

03:39.880 --> 03:43.320
Your new name will be Tripitaka.

03:44.360 --> 03:45.600
Tripitaka.

03:45.680 --> 03:48.640
[scholar] It is a sacred name,
known only to the gods.

03:48.720 --> 03:52.960
And when they hear it,
they will know you are the chosen one.

03:53.040 --> 03:55.000
[thunder booming]

03:58.640 --> 04:00.240
[scholar] The demons have found us.

04:04.680 --> 04:06.680
[wind howling]

04:13.920 --> 04:15.160
[grunting]

04:16.120 --> 04:17.200
[exclaims]

04:18.200 --> 04:19.519
[yells]

04:20.480 --> 04:22.320
[grunting]

04:26.840 --> 04:28.560
[grunting]

04:37.920 --> 04:39.160
[font demon] Tell me where the crown is.

04:40.720 --> 04:42.680
You must hide. Go!

04:43.840 --> 04:45.240
[choking]

04:45.320 --> 04:47.640
This... can't be...

04:47.720 --> 04:49.800
I'm Tripi... tak--

04:49.880 --> 04:51.720
-You are no one.
-[groans]

04:54.040 --> 04:55.800
[thunder booming]

05:04.240 --> 05:05.840
Where is the crown?

05:08.560 --> 05:10.000
[swords clashing]

05:10.600 --> 05:11.680
[scholar groaning]

05:17.120 --> 05:18.520
[font demon] Your gods have deserted you.

05:20.120 --> 05:22.200
Your rebellion is meaningless.

05:51.360 --> 05:52.400
[scholar groaning]

05:53.560 --> 05:55.040
[font demon] Enjoy this parting gift.

06:01.440 --> 06:03.200
[scholar gasping]

06:07.560 --> 06:08.680
What am I to do?

06:10.440 --> 06:12.200
You must live.

06:13.720 --> 06:14.760
[crying]

06:15.520 --> 06:17.080
You know everything.

06:17.720 --> 06:20.160
You must find the Monkey King.

06:21.800 --> 06:23.240
[grunts] Take this.

06:28.600 --> 06:30.800
Hope must never die.

06:32.360 --> 06:33.360
[gasps]

07:03.480 --> 07:05.200
[panting]

07:24.680 --> 07:25.680
No!

07:26.840 --> 07:27.840
It's you!

07:28.840 --> 07:30.560
You've been here all along.

07:32.960 --> 07:34.120
[sobbing] Why now?

07:35.360 --> 07:37.000
Wake up, please!

07:38.480 --> 07:39.480
Monkey!

07:42.760 --> 07:44.480
Wake up.

08:01.520 --> 08:04.760
[girl] I had finally found
where the Monkey King was imprisoned.

08:05.760 --> 08:09.360
But the crown that could release him
was in the hands of demons.

08:11.240 --> 08:12.240
I was alone.

08:13.280 --> 08:15.680
The scholar had taken me in
when I was a baby,

08:16.480 --> 08:17.720
given me everything.

08:18.800 --> 08:20.400
And now he was gone.

08:23.560 --> 08:26.240
Here you are, love.
Looks like you could do with a feed.

08:28.440 --> 08:29.760
[laughing]

08:32.080 --> 08:34.600
[girl] All I could do
was keep his words in my heart...

08:35.640 --> 08:37.559
"Hope must never die."

08:45.760 --> 08:48.200
But it's hard to have hope
on an empty belly.

08:50.120 --> 08:51.520
[indistinct chatter]

08:59.200 --> 09:00.280
What?

09:00.360 --> 09:01.760
Can I get some food?

09:01.840 --> 09:03.400
I don't know, can you?

09:03.960 --> 09:06.680
Uh, may I have some food?

09:07.320 --> 09:08.480
Yes, you may.

09:13.760 --> 09:16.880
Haven't seen you before. Who are you?

09:16.960 --> 09:18.480
[man] Hey, come here!

09:18.560 --> 09:21.000
-[men yelling indistinctly]
-Excuse me.

09:22.720 --> 09:24.720
-[man roaring]
-[glass breaking]

09:24.800 --> 09:26.760
[Monica] Oi! I saw what happened.

09:26.840 --> 09:29.000
I told you clowns
if you can't behave yourself,

09:29.080 --> 09:31.160
you can go down
to that tea house down the road.

09:36.880 --> 09:39.760
[girl] I see the monk,
and I think of Tripitaka.

09:39.840 --> 09:43.240
Suddenly, my hunger isn't so important.

09:50.120 --> 09:53.280
That'll be two crowns... for the soup.

09:53.880 --> 09:55.200
I don't have any money.

09:55.280 --> 09:56.880
Do I look like your mother?

09:56.960 --> 10:00.040
[stammers] I don't know.
I never knew my mother.

10:00.120 --> 10:02.840
Look, I don't run a charity.
You'll have to work it off.

10:02.920 --> 10:05.240
-Can you wash dishes?
-Yes, I can.

10:22.520 --> 10:23.520
[sighs]

10:43.320 --> 10:47.200
I'll take your board out of your wage.
Like your food.

10:47.280 --> 10:50.160
-Thank you. [chuckles]
-[sighs]

11:02.320 --> 11:05.000
[girl's mother] I have walked
from the North Water.

11:05.080 --> 11:07.160
Our village was invaded.

11:07.240 --> 11:10.600
I have nowhere to go and little hope left.

11:10.680 --> 11:14.680
She is pure of heart
and brave as the wind.

11:15.560 --> 11:17.120
I entrust her to you.

11:17.680 --> 11:19.960
[sniffles] "Please take care of my baby.

11:22.280 --> 11:24.240
She's quiet and never cries."

11:24.880 --> 11:26.080
[banging at door]

11:26.160 --> 11:28.960
Lights out. I'm not paying you
to loll about all night.

11:33.440 --> 11:34.400
[sighs]

11:49.160 --> 11:51.000
[laughter and indistinct chatter]

12:08.720 --> 12:09.720
More ale.

12:10.360 --> 12:12.080
-Please.
-Yes, sir.

12:18.960 --> 12:19.880
I'm sorry. Uh...

12:27.800 --> 12:28.960
What's the problem?

12:29.040 --> 12:30.840
Uh... it was an accident.

12:31.560 --> 12:34.920
This man can have as much ale
as he wishes tonight, on the house.

12:35.000 --> 12:36.720
Oh, very kind, your lady.

12:37.360 --> 12:38.360
Butterfingers.

12:54.680 --> 12:56.680
[panting]

13:03.680 --> 13:04.680
What are you doing out here?

13:04.760 --> 13:07.360
I'm sorry. I just got a fright.

13:07.440 --> 13:09.560
Oh. Diddums.

13:21.160 --> 13:22.400
Do you remember what it was like?

13:23.640 --> 13:25.320
Before the gods disappeared?

13:25.880 --> 13:27.320
How old do you think I am?

13:27.400 --> 13:30.680
I'm sorry. I don't know why I said that.

13:30.760 --> 13:32.480
I don't know much of anything.

13:32.560 --> 13:34.560
You know how to look after yourself.

13:35.200 --> 13:38.800
Not too many girls your age could handle
themselves in a place like this.

13:40.000 --> 13:42.040
I'm scared all the time.

13:42.120 --> 13:43.280
We all are.

13:44.840 --> 13:48.560
But that's the world we live in now.
Just have to make the best of it.

13:49.360 --> 13:52.120
Do you think there's a way
for the gods to come back?

13:54.960 --> 13:59.080
A wise man I once knew
used to say, "Hope must never die."

14:00.840 --> 14:01.920
Come on.

14:03.040 --> 14:04.440
We've got work to do.

14:08.280 --> 14:09.680
[sighs]

14:35.480 --> 14:37.440
Do you know "The Dance Of The Moon"?

14:38.280 --> 14:40.480
-Oh, the lullaby?
-Yes. [chuckles]

14:40.560 --> 14:43.200
[chuckles] Is that what your mother
sang to you when you were a kid?

14:43.280 --> 14:46.160
Yes, she did, every night. [chuckles]

14:46.240 --> 14:49.480
-Then, I will play it just for you.
-Oh...

14:52.440 --> 14:54.800
Two, three, and...

14:54.880 --> 14:56.880
[slow music playing]

15:58.080 --> 15:59.080
Stop!

15:59.680 --> 16:00.840
[all gasp]

16:07.280 --> 16:09.640
Somebody has taken something of mine.

16:09.720 --> 16:13.560
And you will suffer very badly
unless I get it back.

16:14.280 --> 16:15.240
Where is it?

16:15.320 --> 16:17.200
Whatever's happened,
I'm sure we can help you.

16:17.280 --> 16:18.160
[grunts]

16:18.240 --> 16:19.160
[choking]

16:19.240 --> 16:20.400
It was the girl!

16:21.400 --> 16:23.520
-What girl?
-The serving girl.

16:23.600 --> 16:24.960
Where is she?

16:26.760 --> 16:28.800
-[grunts]
-[gasps]

16:31.680 --> 16:33.680
[panting]

16:38.920 --> 16:41.760
Your boss will want to know
there's a new demon in town.

16:41.840 --> 16:43.800
She's got some competition with this one.

16:45.120 --> 16:45.960
[slurps]

16:46.040 --> 16:49.400
You're really just gonna sit there and
drink your tea like nothing's happened?

16:50.840 --> 16:51.840
Yeah.

16:53.480 --> 16:54.880
[screaming]

16:54.960 --> 16:57.600
-[clamoring]
-I only want what is mine!

16:57.680 --> 17:01.120
Give me the golden crown,
and I will leave you in peace.

17:01.200 --> 17:02.880
A girl stole it from me!

17:15.000 --> 17:16.240
[monk] You'll be safe here.

17:19.319 --> 17:20.480
This is your monastery?

17:24.240 --> 17:25.599
If you could call it that.

17:27.040 --> 17:29.480
It was once a place of worship and wisdom.

17:29.560 --> 17:31.600
Now, we just meditate.

17:32.560 --> 17:37.360
We meditate on the fate of the world...
and our inability to do anything about it.

17:38.400 --> 17:40.320
Please, I have to get to the forest.

17:40.400 --> 17:43.160
-Can you help?
-I think it would be best to wait.

17:43.240 --> 17:46.400
[sighs] You don't understand.
That demon won't stop until he finds me.

17:46.480 --> 17:47.920
What does he want with you?

17:48.920 --> 17:53.120
It's not me he wants. It's this. [sighs]

17:53.680 --> 17:56.640
Scriptures told of a god
who would wear such a crown.

17:56.720 --> 17:59.720
The Monkey King is real,
and I know where he is.

17:59.800 --> 18:03.160
Please, I don't have time to explain.
I just need to get to the forest.

18:08.920 --> 18:12.200
Once you leave this monastery,
you will need a disguise.

18:13.080 --> 18:14.080
Hurry.

18:16.200 --> 18:17.920
[clamoring]

18:18.000 --> 18:20.720
What are you doing?
There's a demon in the town.

18:20.800 --> 18:22.080
The people need our help.

18:22.160 --> 18:25.600
What can you do? Beg the demon away?
Pray he doesn't kill you?

18:25.680 --> 18:27.160
We'll offer help where we can.

18:29.160 --> 18:31.920
Wait! Who are you, boy?

18:32.000 --> 18:33.360
I... I'm new.

18:35.640 --> 18:36.680
Where is she?

18:36.760 --> 18:40.080
Tell me or I will burn
this stinking village to the ground!

18:40.160 --> 18:41.520
[civilian] I don't know, I swear!

18:41.600 --> 18:43.920
You have to leave this place, demon.

18:45.720 --> 18:47.320
-[civilian groans]
-Go.

18:47.920 --> 18:49.520
[monks yelling]

18:49.600 --> 18:51.080
[all grunting]

19:07.520 --> 19:08.920
[sniffing]

19:10.680 --> 19:13.000
[girl] For once,
I know exactly where to go

19:13.600 --> 19:15.360
and exactly what I must do.

19:29.720 --> 19:30.680
[panting]

19:50.840 --> 19:52.040
[grunts]

20:00.200 --> 20:01.200
[groans]

20:01.920 --> 20:03.040
[coughs]

20:09.080 --> 20:11.000
Are we done with the theatrics?

20:11.080 --> 20:12.440
[rumbling in the distance]

20:37.360 --> 20:38.720
I am the Monkey King.

20:39.400 --> 20:41.240
And what in the seven hells
are you supposed to be?

20:42.560 --> 20:44.200
I am a nightmare.

20:44.280 --> 20:46.840
[scoffs] A nightmare?

20:47.880 --> 20:50.040
No, no, let me tell you what you are.

20:50.120 --> 20:52.480
You're a momentary distraction
from what I was thinking about

20:52.560 --> 20:56.680
before I laid eyes on your disgusting
yet ultimately forgettable face.

20:57.360 --> 20:58.800
And in about three seconds,

20:59.560 --> 21:04.680
I will dispatch you
with the mere flick of my finger.

21:16.200 --> 21:17.440
[chuckles]

21:19.120 --> 21:21.080
[grunts and sighs]

21:21.160 --> 21:23.360
[straining] Uh, monk, if you can fight
or have any weapons,

21:23.440 --> 21:24.800
now might be a good time.

21:24.880 --> 21:27.160
-No, I... I don't. Sorry.
-[breathing heavily]

21:27.840 --> 21:29.480
Oh, I have this.

21:36.160 --> 21:38.640
All right, you snot-knuckled letterhead...

21:40.120 --> 21:41.480
let's see what else you've got.

21:54.040 --> 21:55.120
[grunts]

22:19.680 --> 22:21.200
[both grunting]

22:30.920 --> 22:31.760
[panting]

22:31.840 --> 22:33.040
[grunts]

22:42.240 --> 22:44.440
You should have stayed in that mountain,
Monkey King.

22:51.520 --> 22:52.400
[grunts]

22:53.200 --> 22:54.680
Just the beginning after all.

22:59.200 --> 23:02.640
Please, Monkey, I'm not your enemy.

23:07.600 --> 23:08.920
Then, who are you?

23:09.640 --> 23:11.040
-Hmm?
-I'm...

23:14.200 --> 23:17.080
I'm Tripitaka. And I need your help.

23:22.720 --> 23:24.720
