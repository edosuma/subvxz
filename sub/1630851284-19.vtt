an important communiqué.

00:21.580 --> 00:23.838
It's from the marching band
director at Springfield High.

00:23.858 --> 00:27.008
Oh, did he get his swollen head
stuck in a French horn?

00:27.028 --> 00:29.102
Uh, there's no mention of that.

00:29.196 --> 00:31.605
But it seems one of the band's
most important musicians

00:31.699 --> 00:34.941
injured his middle toe doing
a high step in double-time.

00:35.094 --> 00:38.111
-(all gasp)
-That's footwork suicide!

00:38.264 --> 00:39.705
They need
a replacement sax player,

00:39.932 --> 00:42.041

Lisa Simpson.

00:42.268 --> 00:44.618
Me, in the high school band?

00:44.770 --> 00:47.379
Yes, yes, a thousand times yes!

00:47.606 --> 00:50.440
One yes would suffice.
Pack your sax, Lisa,

00:50.459 --> 00:52.367

00:52.444 --> 00:53.944

02:46.575 --> 02:49.484

Lisa gets to go to high school?

02:49.578 --> 02:51.170
I was supposed
to be King of the Burnouts

02:51.321 --> 02:52.820
before she even got there.

02:52.840 --> 02:55.232
Well, son, I guess Lisa's
just unusually bright.

02:55.250 --> 02:58.660
She gets it from me.

02:58.679 --> 03:00.086
Oh, no, no, no, no, no!

03:00.239 --> 03:02.163

to your dad.

04:27.434 --> 04:30.010
Thanks. That's actually
the reason I got into drums.

04:30.162 --> 04:32.345
To drive him crazy.

04:32.498 --> 04:33.513
But then I...

04:33.665 --> 04:35.832
Turns out,
I really like playing music.

05:51.076 --> 05:52.184

05:52.335 --> 05:54.168
Yes, I did. If you'd like,

I could show you how to brew it
using these simple ingredients.
