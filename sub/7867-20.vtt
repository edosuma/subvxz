00:33.100 --> 00:35.467
but isn't it more important
for a woman

00:35.534 --> 00:38.300
to be smart and powerful
than beautiful?

00:38.367 --> 00:39.534
<i>A woman can be smart,
beautiful and powerful,</i>

00:41.200 --> 00:42.901
like Queen Elizabeth the First!

00:42.968 --> 00:46.534
She had it all,
except the most important thing.

00:46.601 --> 00:48.434
Please don't say "a man. "

00:48.501 --> 00:50.701
No, a husband!

00:50.767 --> 00:53.667
The year was 1588,

00:53.734 --> 00:57.868
<i>400 years before Kirk Gibson
would hit his famous home run.</i>

00:57.934 --> 01:00.834
<i>Queen Elizabeth ruled
over all of England.</i>

01:00.901 --> 01:02.234
<i>Every eligible bachelor
in Europe</i>

01:02.300 --> 01:04.266
<i>wanted her handin marriage.</i>

01:04.334 --> 01:06.434
Majesty, thy
suitors await.

01:06.501 --> 01:08.200
I don't understand
why I need a king.

01:08.267 --> 01:09.701
So you can
pump out a son,

01:09.767 --> 01:12.267
and then I don't gotta work
for no broad no more....

01:12.334 --> 01:13.968
um... my liege.

01:14.033 --> 01:16.801
Announcing Prince Ralph
of Austria!

01:17.601 --> 01:19.734
Off with my head!

01:19.801 --> 01:20.667
Pass.

01:20.734 --> 01:23.100
King Julio of Spain!

01:25.267 --> 01:26.567
Hello, Queenie baby.

01:26.634 --> 01:27.968
Forget it.

01:28.033 --> 01:30.667
I've seen you making
goo-goo eyes at my court jester.

01:30.734 --> 01:33.467
Well, I like a man
who can make me laugh.

01:33.534 --> 01:36.234
But for you, I'll make
an exception.

01:36.300 --> 01:37.801
Hands off my harlequin!

01:37.868 --> 01:41.400
This is 1588, and his material
is fresh and hip.

01:41.467 --> 01:44.133
You have made
a big mistake, lady!

01:44.200 --> 01:45.367
<i>His Excellency,</i>

01:45.434 --> 01:48.000
Sir Walter Raleigh.

01:51.067 --> 01:54.701
Your Majesty, I have returned
from the New World

01:54.767 --> 01:57.400
with a gift; this healthful
and slimming herb...

01:57.467 --> 01:58.701
tobacco.

02:02.968 --> 02:05.334
Whoo...

02:05.400 --> 02:06.934
Whoa!

02:07.000 --> 02:10.533
If I ever have sex,
this will be great afterwards.

02:12.133 --> 02:14.501
I'll show those
uppity English food-boilers.

02:14.567 --> 02:16.834
What is the status
of my armada?!

02:16.901 --> 02:18.133
A hundred and 20

02:18.200 --> 02:20.033
of the finest killing
machines ever built.

02:20.100 --> 02:22.067
Ooh, not bad.
Not bad at all!

02:22.133 --> 02:23.634
Now take me
to the real ones.

02:23.701 --> 02:25.334
Those are the real ones.

02:25.400 --> 02:26.501
Watch out, England!

02:26.567 --> 02:27.968
(English accent):
No, have mercy, Milord!

02:28.033 --> 02:28.934
(Spanish accent):
Never!

02:29.033 --> 02:30.734
Guards, take him away

02:30.801 --> 02:32.267
and put things
inside of him!

02:32.334 --> 02:33.601
Nice things?

02:33.667 --> 02:35.300
No, not nice things!

02:40.000 --> 02:41.801
Allow me.

02:43.167 --> 02:45.901
Ooh, you have
the strength of a plow horse,

02:45.968 --> 02:50.033
but the charm
of a cart horse!

02:50.100 --> 02:51.267
(both moaning)

02:51.334 --> 02:52.267
Treason!

02:52.334 --> 02:53.901
How dare you make out

02:53.968 --> 02:56.734
under my crenellations
while I make out not?

02:56.801 --> 02:58.934
Don't you know that I love you?!

02:59.000 --> 03:00.901
I've always loved you!

03:00.968 --> 03:04.400
Um, which one of us
are you talking to?

03:04.467 --> 03:05.667
I'm not sure.

03:05.734 --> 03:07.667
Both, neither.
What difference does it make?

03:07.734 --> 03:09.100
Take them to the tower!

03:09.167 --> 03:11.133
Whoa, someone call Beowulf!

03:11.200 --> 03:12.434
Grendel got in again!

03:13.467 --> 03:16.167
Oh, it's you, Your Majesty.

03:16.234 --> 03:19.834
(clears throat) The, uh, the
Spanish armada sails for England.

03:19.901 --> 03:21.467
Armada?
What's armada?

03:21.534 --> 03:22.667
Nothing.
What's armada with you?

03:22.734 --> 03:24.067
(laughs)

03:24.133 --> 03:25.934
Seriously, though,
we're in real trouble here.

03:27.467 --> 03:29.133
Come, Tea Biscuit!

03:37.901 --> 03:41.067
The time of battle
grows nigh.

03:41.834 --> 03:43.300
So, here's us...

03:43.367 --> 03:45.067
and a whole lot of them.

03:45.133 --> 03:46.534
It's probably
a little too early

03:46.601 --> 03:48.734
to be standing
under this.

03:50.767 --> 03:54.067
Lord Jesus, although our country
turned Protestant

03:54.133 --> 03:57.601
for the sole reason that our
fat, mean king could dump

03:57.667 --> 04:01.634
his faithful wife, we know
you're on our side.

04:01.701 --> 04:03.801
So please destroy
these horrible monsters

04:03.868 --> 04:05.901
who believe your mother
should be revered.

04:05.968 --> 04:08.167
Amen.

04:14.467 --> 04:16.267
(shrieks) Abandon ship!

04:20.399 --> 04:24.334
Normally, I love to see flaming
dreamboats heading my way,

04:24.400 --> 04:27.033
but not like this, baby,
not like this!

04:31.200 --> 04:33.534
For destroying
the Spanish Armada,

04:33.601 --> 04:37.567
I dub thee "Sir,"
Sir Walter Raleigh.

04:37.634 --> 04:39.701
And I grant you two my blessing.

04:42.767 --> 04:45.200
Your Majesty,
it's so kind of you

04:45.267 --> 04:47.801
to give up the one man
you truly love.

04:47.868 --> 04:51.501
I don't need a man
for I have England!

04:51.502 --> 04:52.502
Yeah, you keep telling yourself that.

04:55.000 --> 04:56.100
You keep soaking.

04:56.167 --> 04:57.801
We're going to Koo Koo Roo,

04:57.868 --> 04:59.901
which in our language
means nothing.

04:59.968 --> 05:03.000
Lisa, you are going
to look so pretty.

05:03.067 --> 05:05.400
Thank you, but I know a story

05:05.467 --> 05:07.834
of a dangerous obsession
with female beauty.

05:07.901 --> 05:11.300
<i>It's called
Snow White and the Seven...</i>

05:11.367 --> 05:13.501
Excuse me! The story
you're about to tell is

05:13.567 --> 05:16.167
the copyrighted property
of The Walt Disney Corporation.

05:16.234 --> 05:18.300
Can you sharpen these?

05:18.367 --> 05:20.167
<i>Excuse me,
but Snow White is a fairytale</i>

05:20.234 --> 05:22.234
from hundreds of years ago.
No one owns that.

05:22.300 --> 05:24.467
Are there any dwarves
in your story?

05:24.534 --> 05:26.767
Yes, but they're my own
original creation.

05:26.834 --> 05:29.133
There's Crabby...

05:29.200 --> 05:30.067
<i>Drunky...</i>

05:30.133 --> 05:31.067
Hungry!

05:31.133 --> 05:32.100
Greedy!

05:32.167 --> 05:33.434
Lenny!

05:33.501 --> 05:34.701
Kearney!

05:34.767 --> 05:36.734
<i>LISA:
... and Doc... tor Hibbert.</i>

05:36.801 --> 05:39.267
(chuckles)

05:39.334 --> 05:42.400
* Ho-hi! *

05:42.467 --> 05:47.601
* Ho-hi, ho-hi,
it's off to work go I *

05:47.667 --> 05:51.534
* This song's not like any song
you know, ho-hi! *

05:51.601 --> 05:54.200
* Ho-hi, ho-hi, ho-hi! *

05:56.667 --> 05:59.067
<i>LISA: Little did they know, their lives</i>

05:59.133 --> 06:01.734
<i>were about to be changed
forever</i>

06:01.801 --> 06:04.133
<i>by a wicked queen.</i>

06:04.200 --> 06:07.767
HDTV on the wall,
who's the fairest one of all?

06:09.033 --> 06:11.801
You would do in a pinch,
my Queen,

06:11.868 --> 06:15.434
but Snow White's the fairest
I have seen.

06:15.501 --> 06:18.334
Also, there's a weather girl
on channel nine who's...

06:18.400 --> 06:21.434
(rolls tongue, giggles)

06:21.501 --> 06:24.501
Bring me Snow White's
heart in this box.

06:24.567 --> 06:26.367
What'll I do
with the rest of the body?

06:26.434 --> 06:28.167
Put it in this box.

06:28.234 --> 06:29.968
Then you'll get your reward.

06:31.734 --> 06:33.167
(thunder crashes)

06:34.367 --> 06:36.467
(humming)

06:38.934 --> 06:43.133
Now turtle, I'll need you
to get in the soup.

06:44.901 --> 06:47.234
(chuckles)

06:47.300 --> 06:50.033
(gasping, screaming)

06:50.100 --> 06:51.734
(laughing)

06:51.801 --> 06:53.167
(screams)

06:55.000 --> 06:57.934
I- I-I cannot do it!

06:58.000 --> 06:59.334
Run, lassie!

06:59.400 --> 07:02.300
Find wee little men,
and hide with them!

07:02.367 --> 07:05.801
Now to fool the queen
with a pig's heart.

07:06.734 --> 07:08.334
I- I cannot do it!

07:08.400 --> 07:09.901
(squeals)

07:09.968 --> 07:14.567
Maybe I'll make her a heart
out of construction paper.

07:14.634 --> 07:17.634
I- I-I cannot do it!

07:17.701 --> 07:19.133
Let's see...

07:19.200 --> 07:20.634
gingerbread house...

07:20.701 --> 07:21.634
Grandma's house...

07:25.634 --> 07:27.834
Ah, here we are.

07:29.334 --> 07:33.100
(yawns)
All that walking made me sleepy.

07:37.934 --> 07:39.334
This bed's too hard.

07:41.601 --> 07:43.601
This bed's too soft.

07:46.234 --> 07:50.467
And this bed is just...

07:50.534 --> 07:52.367
like the first one,
also too hard.

07:52.434 --> 07:55.133
I guess I'll sleep
in the one that's too soft.

07:55.200 --> 07:58.400
(yawns)

08:01.868 --> 08:06.501
* Ho-hi, ho-hi,
it's time to now to get high *

08:06.567 --> 08:09.300
* We'll take some shrooms
and go to our rooms... *

08:10.767 --> 08:11.868
There's something
in our house!

08:11.934 --> 08:13.234
Let's put a pickaxe
in its brain!

08:13.300 --> 08:14.501
You're in marketing.

08:14.567 --> 08:16.100
Why do you even bring
an axe?

08:16.167 --> 08:17.834
If you were in marketing,
you'd know.

08:17.901 --> 08:19.467
(door creaks)

08:22.434 --> 08:26.501
<i>She's beautiful!</i>

08:26.567 --> 08:29.367
Hmm, maybe she's been placed
under some kind of a curse.

08:29.434 --> 08:32.234
And all that will wake her
is the kiss of a handsome...

08:32.299 --> 08:33.667
I'm awake!
I'm awake already!

08:33.734 --> 08:36.067
(sighs) Guess it's you and me
again, doorknob.

08:36.133 --> 08:37.299
(makes kissing sounds)

08:39.467 --> 08:40.767
SNOW WHITE:
Good-bye!

08:40.833 --> 08:43.868
Now beware
of the Evil Queen.

08:43.933 --> 08:45.334
She's a master
of disguise.

08:45.400 --> 08:46.434
She could be anyone!

08:46.501 --> 08:47.501
I'll be careful.

08:47.567 --> 08:49.934
(chuckles)

08:58.701 --> 09:00.467
No, no, no,
that's too much!

09:00.534 --> 09:02.667
Go back outside!

09:02.734 --> 09:03.901
(growls sadly)

09:05.400 --> 09:06.033
Who are you?

09:06.100 --> 09:07.934
Care for an apple?

09:08.000 --> 09:11.334
Okay. Um...
I'll take a green one.

09:11.400 --> 09:13.667
No, take the red one.

09:15.300 --> 09:17.334
(both grunting)

09:17.400 --> 09:20.300
Take a bite, dearie!

09:20.367 --> 09:22.167
(muffled gasps)

09:25.167 --> 09:26.534
(laughs)

09:26.601 --> 09:28.334
Uh-oh.

09:28.400 --> 09:30.567
You'll never take me alive!

09:32.133 --> 09:34.834
(sarcastically):
Ooh, herbivores.

09:34.901 --> 09:37.434
<i>I'm so scared.</i>

09:37.501 --> 09:39.033
(screaming)

09:42.067 --> 09:45.767
<i>LISA: So Snow White slept and
waited for her prince to come...</i>

09:45.834 --> 09:47.901
<i>but he never did...</i>

09:47.968 --> 09:50.367
because a woman shouldn't have
to depend on a man.

09:50.434 --> 09:53.567
<i>Snow White was brought back
to life by a lady doctor.</i>

09:53.634 --> 09:55.767
And she lived
happily ever after?

09:55.834 --> 09:58.868
Well, she couldn't indulge in
strenuous activities like handball,

09:58.934 --> 10:00.734
but otherwise
she was fine.

10:00.801 --> 10:01.868
That's nice.

10:04.033 --> 10:05.267
Marge, I need some bribe money!

10:05.334 --> 10:07.634
Well, don't say it
so loud.

10:07.701 --> 10:10.033
All I have are some
dry-cleaning coupons.

10:10.100 --> 10:11.267
Deal.

10:11.334 --> 10:12.767
Thanks, Marge.

10:12.834 --> 10:14.834
But don't forget, there's still
gonna be a civil suit.

10:14.901 --> 10:15.934
(sighs wearily)

10:16.000 --> 10:18.234
Lisa, let me tell you
the story

10:18.300 --> 10:23.334
of a great woman held back
by a not-so-great husband...

10:23.400 --> 10:24.968
<i>Macbeth!</i>

10:25.033 --> 10:27.601
(grunts)
Out, damned spot! Out, I say!

10:29.667 --> 10:31.200
Marge, please,
If you don't like

10:31.267 --> 10:33.000
getting barbecue sauce
out of a leotard,

10:33.067 --> 10:34.634
why did you get
into show business?

10:34.701 --> 10:36.133
Think before you do.

10:36.200 --> 10:38.467
Oh! I wouldn't be stuck
washing costumes

10:38.534 --> 10:41.267
if my husband had a better role.

10:41.334 --> 10:43.701
Well, I may be playing a tree,

10:43.767 --> 10:45.434
but at least I'm getting
my face out there.

10:46.300 --> 10:47.601
Oh...

10:47.667 --> 10:50.400
I thought I was marrying
a man who could play Macbeth.

10:50.467 --> 10:53.501
Hey, there's no way I could
ever be as good as that guy.

10:53.567 --> 10:55.901
Stars, hide your fires.

10:55.968 --> 11:00.767
Let not light see
my black and deep desires.

11:02.367 --> 11:04.667
Mel's like the son Laurence
Olivier and John Gielgud

11:04.734 --> 11:06.467
always wanted, but never had.

11:06.534 --> 11:08.267
But, oh, how they tried.

11:08.334 --> 11:12.701
I think Mel would be happier
as an understudy.

11:12.767 --> 11:15.601
A six-feet-understudy.

11:15.667 --> 11:17.968
You're not
suggesting... murder?

11:18.033 --> 11:20.834
Wouldst thou live a coward
in thine own esteem,

11:20.901 --> 11:23.801
letting "I dare not"
wait upon "I would?"

11:25.334 --> 11:26.467
Whatever you say, sweetie.

11:29.234 --> 11:33.801
Snore. Snore!

11:37.567 --> 11:38.834
Oh, a prop knife.

11:45.000 --> 11:47.501
Out, out, brief candle.

11:47.567 --> 11:50.033
Life's but a walking shadow...

11:50.100 --> 11:52.467
Why does everyone around here
talk that crazy talk?

11:52.534 --> 11:56.467
That "crazy talk" is the work
of the immortal Bard,

11:56.534 --> 11:59.067
William Shakespeare.

11:59.133 --> 12:00.701
Well, if you see him in heaven,
tell him he sucks.

12:05.667 --> 12:06.934
As you all know,

12:07.000 --> 12:09.834
this afternoon, the bone
fell out of Mel's hair

12:09.901 --> 12:11.501
and beat him to death.

12:11.567 --> 12:14.167
Let us observe a moment
of silence. Moment over.

12:14.234 --> 12:15.400
Homer, you got the lead.

12:20.534 --> 12:21.868
Stay, you imperfect speakers.

12:21.934 --> 12:23.667
Tell me more.

12:23.734 --> 12:24.934
Um...

12:25.000 --> 12:29.501
By Sinel's death,
I know I am thane of Glamis...

12:29.567 --> 12:33.868
Uh, To-morrow and to-morrow
and to-morrow...

12:33.934 --> 12:37.567
Today's Tuesday, so that would
make it Friday, and then, uh...

12:37.634 --> 12:38.767
Shakespeare!

12:38.834 --> 12:40.501
You don't even
know your lines!

12:40.567 --> 12:44.334
(in girly voice): Conrad Birdie?
Coming here to Sweet Apple?

12:44.400 --> 12:45.667
<i>That's Bye-Bye Birdie!</i>

12:47.567 --> 12:50.100
Damn it, Morpheus. Not everyone
believes what you believe.

12:50.167 --> 12:52.200
<i>That's the screenplay for
The Matrix Reloaded.</i>

12:52.267 --> 12:53.267
D'oh!

12:56.334 --> 12:58.100
I can't wait
for the reviews.

13:01.667 --> 13:03.767
Tonight the
Springfield Community Playhouse

13:03.834 --> 13:06.667
was bathed in the light
of a brilliant new star...

13:06.734 --> 13:08.901
Dr. Hibbert as Banquo?!

13:08.968 --> 13:10.200
Who the hell is Banquo?

13:10.267 --> 13:13.234
He's the one getting
the good reviews.

13:13.300 --> 13:15.133
Which makes him the next
one you've got to kill.

13:15.200 --> 13:17.868
Wouldn't it be easier
if I just took acting lessons?

13:17.934 --> 13:20.634
Screw your courage
to the sticking-place

13:20.701 --> 13:22.601
and we'll not fail.

13:22.667 --> 13:24.067
That's inspiring.

13:24.133 --> 13:25.267
What's that from?
Bull Durham?

13:25.334 --> 13:26.534
Macbeth!

13:26.601 --> 13:28.167
Mac-who?

13:38.501 --> 13:40.334
(laughing)

13:49.467 --> 13:50.734
(laughing and coughing)

13:55.133 --> 13:57.167
This number is
for emergencies only.

13:57.234 --> 13:59.100
(Dr. Hibbert laughing on phone)

14:01.200 --> 14:04.300
He who laughs last

14:04.367 --> 14:07.000
laughs dead.

14:08.567 --> 14:10.334
<i>"In last night's Macbeth,</i>

14:10.400 --> 14:13.200
"the best performance was
Barney Gumbel as Duncan,

14:13.267 --> 14:16.934
"followed by Duffman as MacDuff,
Lenny Leonard as Lennox,

14:17.000 --> 14:19.701
"Eddie and Lou as the two
soldiers without lines,

14:19.767 --> 14:23.300
then, last and least,
the lead, Homer Simpson. "

14:23.367 --> 14:26.300
Why do they write a new review
of this play every single day?

14:26.367 --> 14:30.033
All I heard was more names of
actors you haven't killed.

14:30.100 --> 14:32.801
Unless you're
not man enough.

14:32.868 --> 14:34.801
No, dear.
I'm a man, dear.

14:36.000 --> 14:37.834
(conga music plays)

14:46.467 --> 14:48.701
* Killing makes me hungry *

14:48.767 --> 14:51.834
* Eating makes me thirsty *

14:51.901 --> 14:53.534
* Drinking makes me sleepy *

14:55.634 --> 14:59.434
Why did he have to kill everyone
in their costumes?

14:59.501 --> 15:00.834
It was you
who killed us.

15:00.901 --> 15:01.834
You!

15:01.901 --> 15:04.000
No, it was Homer!

15:04.067 --> 15:07.968
Your dark ambition guided
his murderous hand.

15:08.033 --> 15:10.934
No. I just encouraged him.

15:11.000 --> 15:13.033
Encouraged by withholding sex!

15:13.100 --> 15:16.200
Sex...

15:16.267 --> 15:17.434
(spooky moaning)

15:17.501 --> 15:21.000
(Marge screaming
and thudding on ground)

15:21.067 --> 15:24.367
(sobbing)

15:25.634 --> 15:29.234
Well, at least
you can't nag me anymore.

15:29.300 --> 15:31.801
That's where you're wrong.

15:31.868 --> 15:33.367
Get out
on that stage!

15:33.434 --> 15:34.434
Ow!

15:36.067 --> 15:37.801
Okay, Homer, it's our
last performance,

15:37.868 --> 15:39.667
you're the only actor
that's still alive,

15:39.734 --> 15:41.534
and there's nobody
in the audience.

15:41.601 --> 15:43.400
This is your moment.

15:43.467 --> 15:45.234
I'll be in my office
going over the books

15:45.300 --> 15:47.000
on my Subway
sandwich franchise.

15:47.067 --> 15:48.901
You call a sandwich
maker an artist,

15:48.968 --> 15:50.601
it's like an
invitation to steal!

15:50.667 --> 15:53.234
A guy's going nani-nooni
bananas in there!

15:53.300 --> 15:55.167
It's my moment.

16:00.033 --> 16:03.534
To-morrow, and to-morrow,
and tomorrow

16:03.601 --> 16:07.234
creeps in this petty pace,
from day to day,

16:07.300 --> 16:10.334
to the last syllable
of recorded time.

16:10.400 --> 16:12.601
And all our yesterdays
have lighted fools

16:12.667 --> 16:15.400
the way to dusty death.

16:15.467 --> 16:19.033
Out, out, brief candle!

16:19.100 --> 16:22.501
Life's but a walking shadow,
a poor player

16:22.567 --> 16:25.601
that struts and frets
his hour upon the stage

16:25.667 --> 16:27.901
and then is heard no more.

16:27.968 --> 16:29.067
(clapping)

16:29.133 --> 16:30.300
Oh, Homie.

16:30.367 --> 16:32.601
You were brilliant.

16:32.667 --> 16:34.067
I knew you could do it.

16:34.133 --> 16:35.267
I knew it.

16:36.767 --> 16:38.834
Now nothing will stop you
from taking on

16:38.901 --> 16:40.934
all of Shakespeare's
greatest roles.

16:41.000 --> 16:43.434
King Lear. Hamlet.

16:43.501 --> 16:45.434
Othello.
Richard The Third.

16:45.501 --> 16:46.701
Henry the Fourth, Part One.

16:46.767 --> 16:48.334
Henry The Fourth, Part Two.

16:48.400 --> 16:49.367
Henry The Fifth.

16:49.434 --> 16:50.534
Titus Andronicus.

16:50.601 --> 16:52.000
(gunshot firing and thudding)

16:52.067 --> 16:55.567
Me having to read all those
plays would be the real tragedy.

16:55.634 --> 16:57.200
Oh!

17:01.368 --> 17:03.034
That's it, three stories.

17:03.101 --> 17:04.867
That's what we always tell.

17:06.633 --> 17:09.800
Looks like Maggie
wants a story, too.

17:09.867 --> 17:10.967
Ooh.

17:11.034 --> 17:12.834
"The Fountainhead. "

17:12.900 --> 17:16.599
Mom, isn't that book the
bible of right-wing losers?

17:16.666 --> 17:18.900
Yeah, but the guy
on the book jacket

17:18.967 --> 17:21.599
is one sexy slice of beefcake.

17:21.666 --> 17:22.867
(purring)

17:22.934 --> 17:27.300
So, anyway, this is
the story of Maggie Roarke,

17:27.367 --> 17:30.368
an architect
who refused to compromise.

17:32.334 --> 17:35.167
Now, children, while I do
traffic school online,

17:35.234 --> 17:37.201
you'll be playing with blocks.

17:41.767 --> 17:44.368
<i>MARGE:
Maggie's genius and creativity</i>

17:44.434 --> 17:46.667
<i>far exceeded
that of the others.</i>

17:46.734 --> 17:48.700
<i>And I'm not just saying
that 'cause I'm her mother.</i>

17:48.767 --> 17:52.533
<i>But her teacher,
Mr. Ellsworth Toohey,</i>

17:52.600 --> 17:56.034
<i>wanted every child to conform.</i>

17:56.101 --> 17:57.767
Banal. Very banal.

17:57.834 --> 17:59.368
Ooh, wonderfully pedestrian.

17:59.434 --> 18:01.734
Oh, this isn't right.

18:01.800 --> 18:04.967
Maggie, dancers
shouldn't kick too high,

18:05.034 --> 18:07.001
and buildings mustn't
reach the sky.

18:09.567 --> 18:11.001
There. Hmm...

18:11.067 --> 18:14.001
Your rubble is still a little
bit higher than the others.

18:14.067 --> 18:16.434
So, let's
just... There.

18:16.500 --> 18:18.667
Welcome to the
real world, baby.

18:18.734 --> 18:21.434
<i>He would not let
Maggie's creativity flower.</i>

18:35.034 --> 18:36.800
* *

18:56.533 --> 18:58.434
Mediocrity rules!

19:02.600 --> 19:04.034
Alright, Maggie.

19:04.101 --> 19:07.401
Today is parent-teacher day,
so I want everyone to see

19:07.468 --> 19:10.468
how uncreative and
beaten-down you've become.

19:10.533 --> 19:13.067
That's right,
you're beaten-down.

19:13.134 --> 19:15.334
Yes, you are.

19:19.667 --> 19:22.267
I don't know how you put up
with all these kids, Toohey.

19:22.334 --> 19:25.134
If I were you, there'd be
a lot of strangled babies.

19:25.201 --> 19:28.468
Now, let' see what your children
have done, shall we?

19:28.533 --> 19:32.600
Don't brace yourselves,
you will believe your eyes.

19:34.468 --> 19:36.434
It...
(gasping)

19:38.734 --> 19:41.533
You will be tried
as a toddler.

19:44.034 --> 19:45.900
Babies and gentlemen
of the jury...

19:47.500 --> 19:49.468
this child's crime
was to remind the rest of us

19:49.533 --> 19:51.201
that we are merely ordinary.

19:51.267 --> 19:53.767
When a blade of grass rises
above the others,

19:53.834 --> 19:56.267
do we applaud it?
No, we cut it down.

19:56.334 --> 20:01.700
I recommend nine time-outs,
served consecutively.

20:06.633 --> 20:08.267
(clearing throat)

20:08.334 --> 20:10.867
Throughout the ages,
the finger painter,

20:10.934 --> 20:12.567
the Play-Doh sculptor,
the Lincoln-logger,

20:12.633 --> 20:15.734
stood alone against
the daycare teacher of her time.

20:15.800 --> 20:18.468
She did not live
to earn approval stickers.

20:18.533 --> 20:21.533
She lived for herself,
that she might achieve things

20:21.600 --> 20:23.500
that are the glory
of all humanity.

20:23.567 --> 20:27.101
These are my terms. I do not
care to play by any others.

20:27.167 --> 20:30.001
And now, if the court
will allow me, it's nap time.

20:30.067 --> 20:31.900
(yawning)

20:34.633 --> 20:38.434
<i>Maggie grew up to be
a world-famous architect.</i>

20:38.500 --> 20:41.101
<i>Her building became one
of the wonders of the world.</i>

20:45.667 --> 20:49.834
<i>And on the very top floor
was a daycare center</i>

20:49.900 --> 20:53.368
<i>where every child was free
to follow their dream.</i>

20:53.434 --> 20:54.667
<i>Because nothing is...
(gasping)</i>

20:54.734 --> 20:55.867
<i>Maggie, get away from there!</i>

20:57.567 --> 20:59.334
Bad baby!
