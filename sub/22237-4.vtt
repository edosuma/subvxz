00:06.322 --> 00:09.892
It looks like Andy was using magic he
didn't understand and couldn't control.

00:09.893 --> 00:13.196
Felix here and his friends
chased him into the bush -

00:13.217 --> 00:14.979
what do you expect us to think?

00:15.000 --> 00:17.670
If you have any information,
please contact the police.

00:17.691 --> 00:19.619
Did you hear?
They found Andy in Rochford.

00:19.640 --> 00:21.369
- Someone phoned in a sighting.
- What?

00:21.390 --> 00:23.121
I don't think they think
Andy's in Rochford.

00:23.142 --> 00:26.026
They're not telling us something.
We'll just have to find out for ourselves.

00:26.047 --> 00:28.506
So no sign of Andy at all?
This call was a hoax.

00:28.527 --> 00:30.322
I could organise a time
with the school counsellor.

00:30.343 --> 00:31.288
Mr. North...?

00:31.309 --> 00:34.026
Your subconscious spilling the beans
is not awesome, Sam.

00:34.047 --> 00:35.644
My office, lesson five.

00:35.668 --> 00:37.310
How'd it go with the police - OK?

00:37.331 --> 00:40.678
- I feel your pain.
- Mention it again and you'll feel my fist.

00:40.679 --> 00:43.666
- How did you know about this?
- I just drew what was in my head.

00:44.118 --> 00:47.977
If we got close to Alice and I made a
connection, I could sense where her book is.

00:47.998 --> 00:50.740
Oscar knows where Alice's book is
and Alice does too.

00:51.685 --> 00:53.449
Alice beat us to it.

00:53.688 --> 00:57.659
- Now, this is bad.
- Really, really bad.

Season 2, Episode 4

01:43.190 --> 01:46.190
Synced by Reef
addic7ed.com

01:55.992 --> 01:58.003
Well, at least we know
Oscar's power works.

01:58.004 --> 02:01.851
Not tha it helped. Any chance of us getting
Andy back disappeared with that book.

02:01.872 --> 02:04.967
- Then we have to get creative.
- We got creative.

02:04.988 --> 02:07.701
We created a water demon, remember?

02:08.076 --> 02:11.139
If we had a real Water Element,
we could do a tracking spell.

02:11.160 --> 02:12.780
One snag with that, hombre -

02:12.801 --> 02:15.700
our Water Element got vacuumed
up into the sky, remember?

02:15.721 --> 02:17.226
We could find someone else.

02:17.376 --> 02:20.658
- Wait, there's another Water Element?
- Possibly.

02:20.659 --> 02:22.573
You weren't the only ones
with potential.

02:22.594 --> 02:26.120
- I thought we were special.
- You'll always be special to me, Sam.

02:26.141 --> 02:29.614
Well, if there's another slightly less
awesome Water Element out there,

02:29.635 --> 02:31.402
how do we find it?

02:31.423 --> 02:34.113
- Roland.
- Roland's a Water Element...?

02:38.696 --> 02:42.461
- Let's bail.
- He'll find us sooner or later.

02:43.029 --> 02:47.655
You guys get out of here.
I'll go talk to our friendly detective.

02:48.511 --> 02:50.122
Let's go.

02:51.976 --> 02:54.141
We know it was you, Felix.

02:55.051 --> 02:58.332
We traced the call
from the exchange to here.

02:58.552 --> 03:01.523
There's no doubt
that it came from this house.

03:01.580 --> 03:06.073
I... didn't make any call.
Somebody's got it wrong.

03:06.117 --> 03:09.208
Why would someone make a false
statement about a missing person?

03:09.236 --> 03:12.882
Detective, my son just told you
he wasn't responsible.

03:12.913 --> 03:14.209
Then who was?

03:19.667 --> 03:22.650
I was... just trying to help.

03:23.058 --> 03:25.118
Oh, Felix...

03:25.139 --> 03:29.429
Andy said his family used to go
to Rochford when he was a kid.

03:29.530 --> 03:31.011
For holidays.

03:31.044 --> 03:34.289
He liked it there because
it was away from everything.

03:34.310 --> 03:36.852
You failed to mention this
in your interview because...?

03:36.876 --> 03:38.795
It wasn't until after...

03:38.858 --> 03:42.670
I was thinking about Andy
and it came to me.

03:42.691 --> 03:46.908
You do realise it's an offence to make
a false statement to a police officer?

03:46.939 --> 03:52.206
Please, Detective Murphy, my son is
stressed and he made a mistake.

03:55.653 --> 04:00.626
If there's anything else you've forgotten
to tell me, contact me direct.

04:00.627 --> 04:02.642
I'll make sure he does.

04:03.108 --> 04:07.226
- I'll see you out.
- Thank you. We will speak again.

04:07.275 --> 04:09.654
It's alright.
I'll tell them it was me.

04:09.655 --> 04:12.655
It's no use both of us
being on Roland's hit list.

04:13.840 --> 04:18.894
Felix, up. I'm not finished with you yet.
You've got some explaining to do.

04:20.671 --> 04:24.460
Then I called the police and told
them I'd seen Andy in Rochford.

04:24.529 --> 04:26.415
But it wasn't true.

04:26.826 --> 04:27.993
Crazy boy.

04:28.014 --> 04:31.105
- Why would you do that?
- Are you some kind of sociopath?

04:31.292 --> 04:33.732
I thought Andy would be coming home.

04:40.304 --> 04:42.430
Um, I'm so sorry...

04:42.911 --> 04:45.336
- I didn't mean...
- Save your apologies for Andy.

04:45.357 --> 04:48.650
The first 48 hours are crucial
in a missing person's case

04:48.671 --> 04:51.238
and your lie just wasted heaps of them.

04:51.259 --> 04:53.856
- Viv...
- You should listen to your daughter.

04:53.877 --> 04:56.850
- Mum.
- Michael, Nicole, Lily...

04:56.871 --> 04:59.690
If we can help in any way,
you just let us know, OK?

04:59.753 --> 05:03.134
Mrs Lau, Andy will be OK. I know it.

05:03.313 --> 05:04.772
Come on.

05:15.418 --> 05:19.699
Password, of course.
Why would you make this easy?

05:21.430 --> 05:23.410
"Bear Grylls".

05:36.026 --> 05:37.729
"Ninja".

05:39.168 --> 05:41.148
No need to rub it in...

05:48.562 --> 05:51.141
1.618

05:52.137 --> 05:56.155
The golden ratio that appears
in all forms of nature and science.

05:56.750 --> 06:00.778
Such a nerd...
Now, what have you been up to?

06:01.630 --> 06:03.884
___

06:03.937 --> 06:05.309
What...?

06:07.227 --> 06:10.763
So you want to be a powerful magician?

06:13.556 --> 06:15.089
Magic...?

06:15.109 --> 06:16.479
___

06:16.500 --> 06:18.421
No way...

06:22.577 --> 06:25.990
- Anything?
- Nothing.

06:26.316 --> 06:29.815
I guess it's a lot harder
to find Andy than some book.

06:32.396 --> 06:34.566
- Felix...
- What about the other Water Element?

06:34.604 --> 06:36.437
Do you think you could find that?

06:36.484 --> 06:39.134
I don't hear a lot of sorting
going on out there!

06:39.445 --> 06:42.112
Less talking, more sorting,
thank you.

06:42.266 --> 06:47.482
You have to hand it to her - Mum is an
expert at cruel and unusual punishment.

06:47.691 --> 06:51.364
- Never gonna get through all this.
- Thank you for covering for me.

06:51.420 --> 06:55.209
I was trying to buy you more time,
but I messed it up - of couse.

06:55.352 --> 06:59.371
No, you did help, Oskie.
You were right about Alice's book.

06:59.446 --> 07:01.589
Just like you were about
the other universe in your comic.

07:01.609 --> 07:03.759
- Yeah, about that...
- Sorry I tore it up.

07:03.780 --> 07:06.413
- You know I had to try, right?
- No - I mean, I know...

07:06.434 --> 07:08.886
- You can draw another one, maybe!
- Felix!

07:09.554 --> 07:13.281
What I drew in the comics,
you said that really happened?

07:13.631 --> 07:18.615
Well, does that mean that...
in the other universe I could walk?

07:20.256 --> 07:22.478
I didn't know how to tell you.

07:22.890 --> 07:24.288
Sorry.

07:24.607 --> 07:27.203
But... I didn't have a brother?

07:28.377 --> 07:32.958
Well, in this universe, I win.

07:38.499 --> 07:42.466
- Where've you been?
- Here, working everything out.

07:42.511 --> 07:45.955
Grab a brush. This hard work thing
is meant to be good for you.

07:46.031 --> 07:49.046
So is exercise,
but I've managed to avoid that.

07:49.647 --> 07:51.619
Why not?

08:00.825 --> 08:04.571
Having something handmade
is supposed to bring good energy.

08:05.351 --> 08:06.939
What do you think?

08:07.164 --> 08:10.170
Seems like a lot of effort
for good luck.

08:10.171 --> 08:13.316
I just want everything
to go well, that's all.

08:13.433 --> 08:16.716
- We're a good team.
- When we work together.

08:39.539 --> 08:41.751
So how do we find
this Water Element?

08:41.821 --> 08:45.523
Yeah, what made you choose us
for your bizarro magic family?

08:45.544 --> 08:49.978
It wasn't an exact science.
First, I had to establish your Elements.

08:50.050 --> 08:54.337
- Earth, Fire, Air and Water.
- Exactly. It's like star signs.

08:54.358 --> 08:56.365
Everyone is born
with an elemental nature,

08:56.386 --> 08:59.784
but what I really had to find was
four elements with magical potential.

09:00.532 --> 09:05.535
Jake, on the 13th of February,
during a daily bullying ritual...

09:06.164 --> 09:10.243
- Mikey! Come back!
- Come on, Mikey. What are you running for?

09:10.283 --> 09:12.359
Come on, Mike, we're having fun.

09:14.848 --> 09:17.849
- Where'd he go? That way?
- No...

09:17.870 --> 09:20.348
I'd been following
you for weeks.

09:21.213 --> 09:22.910
And then I saw it.

09:26.115 --> 09:29.527
- How'd you do that?
- I see nerd people.

09:29.528 --> 09:32.563
I could tell
that wasn't just a guess.

09:32.564 --> 09:35.145
Lunch.

09:35.166 --> 09:37.189
Sharing's caring, Mikey.

09:37.372 --> 09:40.800
And, Sam, without even seeing
what was about to happen...

09:40.831 --> 09:42.937
...It was crazy - they
were screaming my name.

09:42.957 --> 09:44.377
Sam!?

09:44.470 --> 09:47.864
- You weren't even looking.
- Anyway, where was I?

09:48.134 --> 09:49.821
Which brings us to Andy.

09:49.918 --> 09:52.100
And Bates' once-a-semester
math-lympics.

09:52.169 --> 09:55.526
Next to answer correctly will be
crowned champion math-lete.

09:56.676 --> 10:00.461
- The number that appears in all...
- 1.618 - the golden ratio...

10:01.098 --> 10:04.843
...Is the number that appears
in all forms of nature and science.

10:05.614 --> 10:09.197
Correct. Well, yes,
that's incredible, Andy.

10:10.508 --> 10:13.634
So you win. Well done.
You don't. Sit down.

10:13.655 --> 10:16.769
I knew Andy was a nerd,
but this was different.

10:16.862 --> 10:20.818
And I was right - you all
have magical potential.

10:23.144 --> 10:24.893
What about Mike...?

10:25.011 --> 10:28.319
He does have a sort of
similar intelligence to Andy.

10:28.369 --> 10:29.889
Maximum nerdage!

10:30.051 --> 10:32.256
Dylan? He's a master
of water bombs.

10:32.277 --> 10:34.768
Once he hit someone through
the window of a moving bus.

10:34.823 --> 10:37.008
It's a long shot, but...

10:39.076 --> 10:42.115
- Lachlan?
- No, not him.

10:42.175 --> 10:44.940
Can't get closer to water
than captain of the swim team.

10:44.981 --> 10:46.412
Now we
test them.

10:46.455 --> 10:47.649
Hello.

10:49.760 --> 10:51.075
Hi.

10:51.528 --> 10:53.047
Behind you.

10:54.526 --> 10:55.851
Good catch.

10:56.489 --> 10:59.720
- Thanks for the heads-up.
- You're welcome.

11:00.140 --> 11:03.650
So, um... are you new?

11:04.207 --> 11:06.004
Come on, Jake!

11:06.135 --> 11:09.203
Do I need to remind you
we're in the middle of something?

11:21.159 --> 11:23.155
- Who was that?
- Come on.

11:24.926 --> 11:28.603
- Sure Lachlan came through here.
- The shrink!

11:31.063 --> 11:32.358
Boys...

11:34.278 --> 11:36.250
You can come out now.

11:37.692 --> 11:40.408
Can you make a spell
that makes me immune to hypnotism?

11:40.429 --> 11:43.021
You don't need magic,
just mind power.

11:43.105 --> 11:46.737
- That's what I'm afraid of.
- Focus your energy on the one thing.

11:46.758 --> 11:49.070
- Fortify the mind.
- Hey, there's Lachlan.

11:52.356 --> 11:56.462
Perfect timing, gentlemen. We were
about to search your lockers.

11:56.712 --> 12:01.336
Oh, don't worry. If you've nothing
to hide, there's nothing to worry about.

12:01.542 --> 12:02.922
Is there...?

12:02.943 --> 12:05.756
Detective, I'm sure there won't be.

12:05.776 --> 12:06.972
Boys?

12:14.180 --> 12:16.501
What, don't they feed you at home, kid?

12:16.522 --> 12:19.408
I have an uber-high metabolism.
It's a condition.

12:22.372 --> 12:25.753
This is a locker, Jake.
Not a dirty clothes basket.

12:29.302 --> 12:31.286
Nothing suspicious there.

12:37.242 --> 12:39.633
We want to find Andy
as much as anyone.

12:39.654 --> 12:43.442
A rubbish skip seemed like
an odd place to start.

12:44.092 --> 12:46.634
I don't miss much, Felix.

12:46.635 --> 12:51.655
Long story short - I'll find out
exactly what happened to Andy.

12:52.677 --> 12:54.930
I think I've got everything I need.

12:57.436 --> 12:59.400
I'll catch you boys later.

13:00.645 --> 13:03.374
Alright, show's over, everyone.

13:04.629 --> 13:07.670
Listen, none of this can be easy,
so if you ever wanna talk...

13:07.671 --> 13:10.627
Let me guess, you're here for me.

13:11.150 --> 13:15.450
- Of course you are.
- Excuse me, I'm still your teacher, Jake.

13:15.498 --> 13:18.139
Yeah, that's right and nothing more.

13:23.608 --> 13:25.209
Move along.

13:34.698 --> 13:39.144
Sorry about the... about the smell.

13:43.284 --> 13:46.662
I don't like to wash my socks
after a footy win, for luck.

13:46.663 --> 13:49.662
- Does it work?
- I'm the best kick on the team.

13:49.663 --> 13:53.058
You're not too bad yourself,
from what I saw.

13:53.098 --> 13:55.896
- Really?
- Yeah...

14:03.330 --> 14:06.334
- How long have you creeps been there?
- Long enough.

14:06.384 --> 14:08.495
"Best kick on the team", huh?

14:08.516 --> 14:10.369
Shouldn't we be following
our Water Element?

14:10.390 --> 14:12.402
It'd be quicker if we split up
and take one each.

14:12.423 --> 14:15.198
Let's see what we can
find, meet up later.

14:19.930 --> 14:21.988
What do you think
the cops were looking for?

14:22.009 --> 14:23.166
I don't know.

14:23.167 --> 14:26.225
Those boys know something
about what happened to my brother.

14:26.246 --> 14:28.912
What tipped you off?
The huge police investigation?

14:28.933 --> 14:30.694
This is different.
I found something.

14:30.715 --> 14:31.874
OK, here we are.

14:31.912 --> 14:33.493
Meet me in
the library.

14:33.514 --> 14:35.545
Wow, not crazy at all.

14:35.588 --> 14:39.727
Mia, Ellen. Meet Saskia,
Bremin High's newest student.

14:39.748 --> 14:42.953
Ellen, would you mind buddying up, showing
her the lay of the land, so to speak?

14:42.974 --> 14:45.901
Newbie-babysitting?
Kill me now.

14:45.922 --> 14:48.118
Thank you.
Knew I could count on you.

14:50.072 --> 14:53.102
- Ready.
- I know.

14:53.122 --> 14:55.470
This is my excited face.

14:59.632 --> 15:02.392
Mike. Hey, mate. Um...

15:02.573 --> 15:06.044
I was just wondering if you knew
anything about the golden...

15:06.088 --> 15:10.452
- The what?
- You know, that science thing...?

15:10.481 --> 15:13.194
You're interested in science?
So am I!

15:14.466 --> 15:16.269
- Kind of.
- Great.

15:24.776 --> 15:26.399
Nice one, Dylan.

15:54.440 --> 15:57.703
Personally, I'm far more interested
in the natural sciences.

15:57.724 --> 16:00.735
Much more fascinating than mathematical
theories, don't you think?

16:00.756 --> 16:03.623
- Um... yeah...
- Have you seen that double rainbow video?

16:03.644 --> 16:05.372
I've seen it, like, 200 times.

16:07.084 --> 16:09.797
- Seen Dylan?
- Over there.

16:12.281 --> 16:13.693
Where?

16:15.701 --> 16:17.285
Oh, no.

16:18.196 --> 16:21.645
Better run, Dracula.
This one's got holy water in it.

16:41.517 --> 16:44.850
Whatever's going on, I'll bet it
has something to do with these.

16:45.045 --> 16:48.120
- What are they?
- They're magic websites.

16:48.858 --> 16:51.247
I found them in Andy's
internet history.

16:51.268 --> 16:55.243
Andy was always weird,
but he wasn't... magic weird.

16:55.532 --> 16:59.628
Are you sure the boys aren't
in league with sparkly vampires

16:59.649 --> 17:01.483
and werewolves with amazing abs?

17:01.504 --> 17:03.523
Can you be serious for like five minutes?

17:03.667 --> 17:07.655
We are talking about magic.
How serious can it be?

17:09.441 --> 17:12.555
So Felix has been jumpy
and secretive since he came back.

17:12.576 --> 17:15.367
He's always been
jumpy and secretive.

17:15.444 --> 17:18.281
He wouldn't hide something
that would help find Andy.

17:20.358 --> 17:22.597
Is this really what
I look like?

17:22.691 --> 17:25.650
That's actually a good ID photo.
You look really pretty.

17:25.671 --> 17:27.131
You think so?

17:28.416 --> 17:32.619
You should borrow some books.
Go forth and feast on knowledge.

17:32.677 --> 17:34.501
OK. Thanks.

17:36.183 --> 17:40.483
If you're sure they've got nothing to hide,
then why don't you ask them about these?

17:43.916 --> 17:48.556
Magic? No way. None of us know
anything about magic, at all.

17:48.577 --> 17:50.596
- Except for Felix.
- Well, yeah.

17:50.617 --> 17:52.353
- And maybe Andy?
- I guess.

17:52.374 --> 17:54.377
- Probably Jake too.
- A little bit.

17:54.398 --> 17:58.775
You've gone from swearing none of you know
anything about magic to admitting you all do.

17:58.874 --> 18:00.060
I did...?

18:00.081 --> 18:03.960
You creep around with Sam and Jake
like the demented Three Musketeers

18:03.981 --> 18:06.358
and you're being investigated
by the police.

18:06.379 --> 18:09.065
But everyone else is crazy
and there's nothing going on?

18:09.086 --> 18:11.793
- When you put it like that, it sounds...
- Delusional?

18:11.814 --> 18:15.856
- Is there anything you wanna tell me?
- Why does everyone keep asking me that?

18:15.877 --> 18:18.324
When did I become 'everyone'?

18:18.616 --> 18:21.276
Wanna know something
I haven't told you? Fine.

18:21.365 --> 18:23.644
When I was lost in the forest,
I thought about you.

18:23.664 --> 18:27.555
- Whatever. What kind of things?
- I don't know.

18:27.576 --> 18:29.475
How much you hate boy bands,

18:29.597 --> 18:32.182
how you paint your little fingernail
a different colour,

18:32.203 --> 18:36.418
how you wear that bracelet we bought
although you've fixed it six times.

18:36.439 --> 18:38.977
But it's all been so crazy
with Andy gone,

18:38.998 --> 18:43.100
doesn't seem right to focus on anything
else, even if it is important to me.

18:48.833 --> 18:51.257
Sorry. Hopeless at this.

18:51.278 --> 18:53.182
Yeah, terrible.

18:56.847 --> 18:58.839
- Come here.
- I'll be right back.

19:01.241 --> 19:06.309
Dude, Mike is a total bust. I think
I should follow one of the others.

19:22.610 --> 19:24.356
___

19:24.445 --> 19:27.050
___

19:28.204 --> 19:33.592
Look, babe, all this magic stuff,
it's not what you think.

19:33.652 --> 19:37.292
I saw this shrink and he says
that when I talk about magic,

19:37.313 --> 19:40.234
it's just me trying to cover up
trauma, or something.

19:40.255 --> 19:43.951
Like my brain doesn't want me
to remember me being lost.

19:44.375 --> 19:47.920
- I wouldn't lie to you.
- Then why didn't you tell me?

19:47.984 --> 19:50.082
Just didn't want you to worry.

19:51.484 --> 19:53.834
___

19:55.946 --> 19:59.369
There seems to be a lot of things
you don't want me to worry about.

19:59.469 --> 20:01.837
I just remembered that
I have to be somewhere.

20:02.038 --> 20:03.344
Mia!

20:05.409 --> 20:07.672
You're always in the last place
I look.

20:07.693 --> 20:11.135
Good news - your Mum's really keen
for us to get started, so let's kick off.

20:11.156 --> 20:13.845
Why not?
My day's already going so well.

20:17.012 --> 20:20.039
This could form a major part
of the police investigation.

20:20.040 --> 20:22.590
No way - we're not dobbing
them in to the cops.

20:22.611 --> 20:25.277
- You'd've rather they get away with it?
- With what?

20:25.298 --> 20:28.241
They may have lied,
but they're not criminals.

20:29.869 --> 20:32.533
I think this is the part where
you're meant to back me up.

20:32.554 --> 20:34.847
What if they're into something
they can't get out of?

20:34.868 --> 20:37.927
- The police might be able to help.
- Like the detective said,

20:37.928 --> 20:41.253
if they've got nothing to hide,
they have nothing to worry about.

20:42.757 --> 20:45.648
Why don't you let us find out
what's going on?

20:45.885 --> 20:49.896
If there really is something bad, you can
go to the cops and we'll come with you.

20:49.897 --> 20:51.527
We will...?

20:51.733 --> 20:54.430
The police have already
tried asking straight out.

20:54.451 --> 20:58.192
We would be a little more... subtle.

21:01.913 --> 21:07.901
OK, so, uh, close your eyes.
We're going to get into the zone.

21:09.222 --> 21:13.659
So, I want you to just listen
to the sound of my voice.

21:14.040 --> 21:17.904
I'm gonna count slowly,
backwards, from five.

21:17.925 --> 21:21.319
- Five...
- Focus the mind.

21:21.340 --> 21:24.621
- Four...
- Focus the mind.

21:24.642 --> 21:27.661
- Three...
- Focus the mi...

21:27.715 --> 21:32.513
Let your breathing become slower
and steadier as you relax.

21:32.569 --> 21:35.228
- Two...
- Focus the...

21:35.255 --> 21:37.350
And one.

21:40.235 --> 21:41.510
OK.

21:42.197 --> 21:45.379
So... we're now back
in the forest.

21:45.464 --> 21:47.475
Dappled light coming in
through the leaves,

21:47.501 --> 21:50.773
the big green trees
and the soft undergrowth...

21:50.889 --> 21:52.916
Can you see the forest?

21:52.917 --> 21:55.336
- Yeah.
- Good.

21:55.807 --> 21:57.550
OK, so...

21:57.938 --> 22:00.682
What do you remember
of your time there?

22:01.892 --> 22:05.189
I... ate scrambled eggs.

22:06.279 --> 22:09.936
Nice work.
What else do you remember?

22:09.937 --> 22:13.916
I ate... mouldy doughnuts
from a bin.

22:13.917 --> 22:15.896
Alright, go on.

22:16.273 --> 22:20.814
I ate pig trotters.
They were pretty good.

22:22.660 --> 22:25.631
I ate a whole table of Chinese food.

22:25.739 --> 22:29.433
OK, can you remember
anything other than food?

22:30.634 --> 22:32.175
Yes.

22:32.593 --> 22:34.118
Good.

22:34.673 --> 22:36.653
Jake's porridge.

22:37.782 --> 22:39.742
That wasn't food.

22:44.055 --> 22:48.047
Best friends since primary school and
now I'm supposed to be spying on him.

22:48.068 --> 22:49.610
It was your idea.

22:49.631 --> 22:52.222
I had to stop Viv going
to the cops somehow.

22:52.243 --> 22:54.887
Why is even any of this our problem?

22:54.908 --> 22:57.289
I don't even know how I feel
about Sam anymore.

22:57.310 --> 22:59.526
Trouble in perfect-couple land?

23:01.115 --> 23:05.095
I just feel like since Sam's
come back, he's a different person.

23:05.956 --> 23:10.254
I just... I don't even know
if I can trust him at all.

23:13.506 --> 23:16.737
There's something I have to do.
I'll see you later.

23:22.259 --> 23:25.222
- Sam!
- Mia. Hey.

23:25.286 --> 23:29.257
Want some? I ate heaps for lunch
and I'm starving. It's weird.

23:29.278 --> 23:33.085
- Can we talk?
- I thought we talked already.

23:33.214 --> 23:36.665
Just tell me the truth. Right now.

23:36.790 --> 23:39.297
- About what?
- You know what.

23:39.298 --> 23:41.854
About what happened to you,
what happened to Andy,

23:41.875 --> 23:44.569
why you keep running off
with Jake and Felix.

23:45.190 --> 23:48.116
Either you tell me now, or...

23:48.880 --> 23:50.422
Or what?

23:51.535 --> 23:54.575
Or I don't think
we can be together anymore.

23:57.541 --> 23:58.922
Well...?

24:03.726 --> 24:05.766
There's nothing going on.

24:07.971 --> 24:10.400
OK, Sam, if that's how
you want it to be.

24:10.420 --> 24:13.643
- Mia!
- Bye, Sam.

24:20.804 --> 24:24.304
- How'd it go with Lachlan?
- The shrink got me.

24:24.325 --> 24:26.395
- And you spilled your guts?
- No.

24:26.416 --> 24:31.158
My mind's a fortress, but my
heart... it's a whole other story.

24:31.956 --> 24:33.487
Mia...

24:35.456 --> 24:38.797
- Mia dumped me.
- We all kind of saw that coming.

24:39.044 --> 24:41.277
- Harsh, Felix.
- Sorry.

24:41.298 --> 24:44.217
I'd say the search for the Water
Element was an epic fail.

24:47.221 --> 24:49.209
Incoming!

24:56.758 --> 25:00.744
- How are you doing that?
- I don't know, I tried to catch it.

25:05.175 --> 25:07.143
"Magical potential".

25:07.327 --> 25:10.868
More like "magic".
She controlled water.

25:11.455 --> 25:15.004
It's OK. You're the one
we're looking for.

25:20.557 --> 25:21.837
Look.

25:21.858 --> 25:23.669
What are they doing with her?

25:23.690 --> 25:26.438
A girl like Saskia shouldn't have
that much magical power.

25:26.459 --> 25:28.780
- What - more than you?
- More than any of us.

25:28.801 --> 25:31.934
- I have to tell you something in private.
- Don't hate me.

25:32.060 --> 25:35.015
Maybe Viv's right, maybe
this needs to be a police thing now.

25:35.036 --> 25:37.859
Ready to reconstruct the scene
of Andy's disappearance?

25:37.880 --> 25:40.864
You wanna charge us, then do it;
otherwise we don't have to be here.

25:40.885 --> 25:43.415
People who say that
usually have something to hide.

25:43.436 --> 25:45.643
We think Andy might be
in the other universe.

25:45.664 --> 25:46.767
You can't be serious.

25:46.788 --> 25:50.013
I've reworked the unmaking spells.
We can travel between the universes.

25:50.034 --> 25:53.384
- So, about dinner at my place tonight.
- I'm having dinner at your place?

25:53.405 --> 25:54.658
Yeah, tonight.

25:57.568 --> 25:59.846
- What's going on?
- This.

26:00.765 --> 26:04.959
Stop! I'm filming everything.
What have you done to Jake?
