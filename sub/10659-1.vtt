WEBVTT

01:05.713 --> 01:09.818
Did we get that?

01:09.851 --> 01:13.488
Fucking nightmares!

01:37.512 --> 01:39.881
Morgan.

01:55.363 --> 01:58.567
-Is it?
-Yeah, that's what it is?

02:01.469 --> 02:02.837
How much are we gonna eat
of these?

02:05.006 --> 02:08.476
-No wonder I go nuts!
-Sarge's in charge!

02:08.509 --> 02:10.346
The sarge's in charge
of the meat.

02:10.378 --> 02:12.915
Colonel Dooley!

02:14.885 --> 02:17.887
How about a high five?

02:19.388 --> 02:21.723
Here's Tomlin and his son.

02:21.990 --> 02:23.793
You're gonna be
a future soldier?

02:23.825 --> 02:25.927
-No.
-What?

02:25.961 --> 02:28.898
Where's the bell? The bell?

02:28.931 --> 02:32.434
I have no idea
what you're talking about!

02:32.468 --> 02:36.339
Let's get
a nice little family shot.

02:36.372 --> 02:39.309
You guys are too sexy
for this camera.

02:40.442 --> 02:43.879
It's pre-deployment.
So we're here again.

02:43.912 --> 02:46.782
Some of us
for the first time but...

02:46.814 --> 02:49.718
for the regiment, as you know,
it's the 3rd deployment

02:49.752 --> 02:51.119
back to the box in 5 years.

02:55.157 --> 02:58.561
-You love the camera, don't you?
-No! Stop!

02:58.593 --> 03:00.795
You don't have to worry
about this, man,

03:00.829 --> 03:02.630
I'm gonna protect him.

03:02.664 --> 03:06.000
Well, you're gonna have
to answer to me,

03:06.033 --> 03:07.435
if you don't...

03:07.468 --> 03:10.038
That is no joke.

03:10.071 --> 03:12.408
-I ain't gonna mess with that.
-No way.

03:12.440 --> 03:15.478
You agree
why we're going to war?

03:15.510 --> 03:18.446
Yeah! Hell yeah!

03:18.480 --> 03:20.950
You could've closed
your mouth when you chew?

03:20.982 --> 03:23.919
The sex I like is shitting,
then fucking.

03:23.951 --> 03:27.455
Then you fuck, then you shit.

03:27.488 --> 03:29.491
You gotta relax and...

03:29.525 --> 03:32.795
-Both at the same time's best.
-I think it's German.

03:47.575 --> 03:50.044
This is for your
girls, Oli. Wait a minute.

03:50.077 --> 03:52.814
Ok, I need a full
body shot here.

03:52.848 --> 03:56.518
Very nice. Very nice.

03:56.551 --> 03:59.487
You know I love it
when you wear your uniform.

03:59.521 --> 04:01.557
Yes! That's very sexy.

04:01.589 --> 04:02.791
Ok, this one's for me,
not for the girls.

04:02.825 --> 04:04.460
We'll have to take another one
for your girls.

04:04.492 --> 04:07.729
This was your idea.
Don't laugh.

04:07.762 --> 04:11.666
Ok. Oli, This is your video.
It's your video.

04:11.700 --> 04:15.905
Ok, guys, you know how many
times we've been through this.

04:15.938 --> 04:18.873
Diane is gonna need you as much
as you're gonna need her. Ok?

04:18.906 --> 04:22.077
When I hold it like this,
it looks like my head is giant.

04:23.544 --> 04:24.879
What are you laughing at?

04:24.912 --> 04:28.616
Ok. Maybe you don't have
to mind Diane too closely

04:28.650 --> 04:29.685
because she'll...
We'll be fine.

04:29.717 --> 04:32.587
Know what? You don't have
to listen to her at all.

04:32.621 --> 04:34.457
Actually, I take
all of that back.

04:34.489 --> 04:36.558
We'll be fine!

04:36.592 --> 04:38.428
I love you, guys.

04:51.806 --> 04:55.510
<i>We didn't even know
what we were fighting for.</i>

05:00.015 --> 05:01.918
<i>We were lost.</i>

05:06.522 --> 05:08.924
<i>And then it...</i>

05:10.558 --> 05:12.828
<i>...happened!</i>

05:15.630 --> 05:18.467
<i>All his fault.</i>

05:28.075 --> 05:30.912
Wake up!

05:33.981 --> 05:35.950
Taking a nap
on a picnic table?

05:35.984 --> 05:38.087
School's out, motherfuckers!

05:38.120 --> 05:40.055
He! He! Woohoo!
Hey, buddy!

05:40.087 --> 05:41.623
Let me see that. Yeah!

05:41.657 --> 05:44.793
So where's your sister?
I don't know.

05:44.825 --> 05:46.261
Honestly, I could've earned
another credit

05:46.294 --> 05:48.097
for how much time
she's wasted this year.

05:48.130 --> 05:49.265
She's
in the principal's office.

05:49.298 --> 05:52.067
Yeah, man, your sister's
a badass. Did you know that?

05:52.099 --> 05:54.003
This has to be your fault.

05:56.738 --> 05:59.575
<i>Come a little closer.</i>

06:00.575 --> 06:03.278
<i>Sexy.</i>

06:07.315 --> 06:09.217
<i>Shake that ass for me.</i>

06:16.024 --> 06:18.627
-Hey, guys!
-Hey, Kate.

06:18.659 --> 06:21.664
So what's the damage? Did they
cancel your summer vacation?

06:21.697 --> 06:23.699
No, I got a package
from my dad.

06:24.733 --> 06:26.602
John? Are you seriously
filming this?

06:26.635 --> 06:27.736
Why not?

06:27.769 --> 06:30.673
What's that?
It's the DVD from my dad.

06:32.707 --> 06:34.710
<i>Badass.</i>

06:35.911 --> 06:37.613
<i>It's good.</i>

06:38.813 --> 06:42.051
My drive's not working so we're
gonna have to watch it at home.

06:42.084 --> 06:44.053
-Why did he send it here?
-I don't know.

06:44.085 --> 06:46.354
It's probably just some guy DVD
and he forgot to put it in,

06:46.387 --> 06:47.755
like black market stuff.

06:47.789 --> 06:49.959
Yeah, that sounds like my dad!

06:49.991 --> 06:52.193
-My dad wouldn't send that.
-I don't know.

06:52.226 --> 06:53.928
You don't think so? You being
"conspiracy and all,"

06:53.962 --> 06:55.664
you don't think he'd send
some black market stuff?

06:58.633 --> 07:01.570
<i>-Look at that?
-What are you drinking?</i>

07:04.673 --> 07:09.011
<i>All right. Dance, dance...</i>

07:09.044 --> 07:11.613
You guys going to Jake's party
tonight?

07:11.647 --> 07:13.882
-Can you give me a ride?
-Of course.

07:13.914 --> 07:15.383
Can you give me a ride?

07:15.416 --> 07:17.152
My goodness, John,
can you give me a ride?

07:17.185 --> 07:18.320
You're not coming,
you're walking.

07:18.352 --> 07:20.788
-Please, John!
-Can I have my camera?

07:20.822 --> 07:22.658
Yeah! Go ahead.

07:22.690 --> 07:24.392
Bye, Kate!
See you guys later.

07:24.426 --> 07:25.760
Bye.

07:27.162 --> 07:28.763
<i>Now like this.</i>

07:28.796 --> 07:30.799
<i>Like that.</i>

07:30.832 --> 07:32.168
<i>And like this.</i>

07:39.106 --> 07:41.210
<i>This thing fucked.</i>

07:44.346 --> 07:45.881
<i>Back to drunk movies, then.</i>

07:46.882 --> 07:48.751
Are you watching
skateboard videos again?

07:48.784 --> 07:51.186
No. I'm just uploading it
to Konnect.

07:51.219 --> 07:53.022
You're gonna kill yourself
on that thing, you know.

07:53.054 --> 07:54.722
Says the sister
who will probably sit

07:54.755 --> 07:56.157
in front of the computer
her whole life,

07:56.190 --> 07:58.794
getting fat and then dying
of a heart attack.

07:58.827 --> 08:02.098
Maybe. This is definitely
a hard drive problem.

08:09.236 --> 08:11.806
<i>I say we toast
to world peace.</i>

08:11.839 --> 08:14.409
To world peace.

08:18.212 --> 08:20.782
What's going on with you
and John?

08:20.815 --> 08:21.984
What do you mean?

08:22.017 --> 08:26.121
He's your boyfriend, no?
That would be a first for you.

08:26.154 --> 08:29.992
-Ok. I've had boyfriends before.
-Yeah, but not like him.

08:30.025 --> 08:32.027
What are you trying to say?

08:32.059 --> 08:35.397
<i>Shit! Boy!</i>

08:35.429 --> 08:38.131
<i>You're too hot for this hotel!</i>

08:38.164 --> 08:40.802
<i>Man!</i>

08:40.836 --> 08:44.373
<i>A little Bourbon...</i>

08:48.976 --> 08:51.847
John's kind of stupid,
don't you think?

08:51.880 --> 08:53.981
I guess he's
a bit of a project.

08:54.015 --> 08:55.750
Another science experiment?

08:55.784 --> 08:59.221
All right, girls, I'm heading
to the grocery store.

08:59.254 --> 09:00.856
Do you need anything?

09:00.889 --> 09:03.058
Diane, do you know
how to knock?

09:03.091 --> 09:05.994
-We're good. Thanks.
-Are you sure?

09:06.026 --> 09:09.430
-Yeah.
-Ok. See you soon.

09:09.463 --> 09:10.898
Bye!

09:13.201 --> 09:14.770
You could be a little bit
nicer to her.

09:14.803 --> 09:17.972
Yeah, ok, Kate. Can we
not go through this again?

09:18.005 --> 09:20.509
Could you try, though?
Like Dad said.

09:20.542 --> 09:22.845
Yeah, Dad said. Ok.

09:22.877 --> 09:26.414
He! He! He!

09:49.004 --> 09:52.508
We have here a real life
mystery on our hands!

09:52.540 --> 09:56.779
Kate here received
a mysterious unlabelled DVD

09:56.812 --> 09:58.947
from our father in Afghanistan.

09:58.980 --> 10:02.017
But I think we should question
that claim.

10:02.049 --> 10:04.419
Of course, it's from Dad.

10:04.452 --> 10:06.922
Why are you filming this?

10:06.954 --> 10:09.323
-I'm documenting our lives.
-All the time?

10:09.356 --> 10:13.028
There was not letter. So you're
just guessing it's from Dad.

10:13.060 --> 10:15.930
Who else would send us
something from Afghanistan?

10:15.963 --> 10:19.234
Ready?
It's just weird. Yeah.

11:05.914 --> 11:08.616
What the fuck?

11:08.650 --> 11:11.419
That can't be real.
It has to be fake.

11:11.452 --> 11:15.991
I don't know.
It looked pretty real to me.

11:16.024 --> 11:17.860
Come on, Kate! It can't be.

11:17.893 --> 11:20.028
It's shit quality.

11:20.060 --> 11:21.863
They can't even keep
the camera steady.

11:21.896 --> 11:23.965
That's why I think it's real.

11:23.999 --> 11:26.869
If it was fake, it would look
more planned, polished.

11:26.901 --> 11:28.402
True, but Dad wouldn't
send this.

11:28.435 --> 11:31.439
It has no connection to him.
I don't think he sent it.

11:31.472 --> 11:33.375
No notes. Sent it at school.

11:33.408 --> 11:35.010
So let's see the package.

11:35.043 --> 11:38.046
I threw it out
in the principal's office.

11:38.078 --> 11:41.916
Kate! Wha... Why?
That was our only evidence!

11:41.949 --> 11:43.182
How was I supposed to know

11:43.183 --> 11:44.986
it was going to be some
psychotic video?

11:45.020 --> 11:46.954
I don't watch all that
conspiracy crap that you do.

11:46.987 --> 11:51.058
Whatever! Kind of reminded me
of the stuff Rhys does.

11:51.092 --> 11:52.627
Let's go ask him.

11:52.660 --> 11:54.462
-Right now?
-Yeah.

11:56.364 --> 11:58.901
Welcome to my land!

11:58.933 --> 12:02.203
Come, my pretty.

12:02.236 --> 12:04.206
Be one of us.

12:04.239 --> 12:06.909
-We'll never be one of you.
-Hum.

12:06.942 --> 12:09.411
Forgot how many of these
you had.

12:09.443 --> 12:10.544
What? These guys?

12:10.578 --> 12:13.381
Yeah, they are collector's
items, called classics.

12:13.414 --> 12:15.583
Cult of the psychologically
disturbed.

12:15.616 --> 12:18.053
<i>Disturbed?
I have that. Great film.</i>

12:18.086 --> 12:19.955
Wanna watch it?
I have something better.

12:19.987 --> 12:22.089
Maybe you can tell us
who the director is.

12:22.122 --> 12:23.892
If it's gore, I'm your man.

12:26.394 --> 12:27.562
Thanks for coming.

12:27.595 --> 12:29.264
-Ok. Ok.
-Hey!

12:29.297 --> 12:31.266
How are you doing, buddy?

12:31.299 --> 12:32.967
-That's enough!
-I'm making a sex tape.

12:33.000 --> 12:35.270
Give me more. Yum!

12:35.303 --> 12:38.307
It's about love! Passion!

12:38.340 --> 12:41.109
Connection!
Rhys, you suck at filming.

12:41.141 --> 12:44.112
Anyone got some popcorn?

12:46.747 --> 12:49.951
Shit production value.
Just wait, it picks up.

12:49.985 --> 12:51.986
I got it.
Rhys Productions, right?

12:52.020 --> 12:54.055
Guy can't hold a camera
for shit.

12:54.990 --> 12:57.092
-Is it?
-Is it what?

12:57.125 --> 12:58.260
Rhys Productions?

12:58.293 --> 13:00.629
No. I was kidding,
but you're not.

13:00.661 --> 13:04.398
What the fuck is this? No,
no, no, dude, this is not mine.

13:04.432 --> 13:07.135
-Your dad sent this?
-It said it was from him.

13:07.168 --> 13:08.669
But I really don't think
he made this.

13:08.702 --> 13:10.472
So you and Rhys
aren't behind this?

13:10.505 --> 13:13.275
Me? You seriously think I'm
behind this sick piece of shit?

13:13.308 --> 13:15.010
-I didn't.
-But he does.

13:15.043 --> 13:17.412
Well, she kind of looks
like you.

13:17.444 --> 13:20.015
-No, she doesn't!
-Yeah!

13:20.048 --> 13:22.183
Her hair is longer
and straighter.

13:22.217 --> 13:24.486
But it looks a bit wet,
so it could look straighter.

13:24.519 --> 13:26.587
What's this here?

13:28.555 --> 13:30.291
Ompa-something.

13:30.324 --> 13:33.527
-Yes, yes, yes!
-Ompah Valley Trail.

13:33.560 --> 13:36.197
That's where we used to train
for cross-country.

13:36.231 --> 13:39.367
Checking it out is the only way
to find out. Right?

13:39.400 --> 13:40.702
What about the party?

13:40.735 --> 13:43.071
Who cares about the party?
This is more important.

13:43.103 --> 13:45.106
There could be a psycho
out there.

13:45.140 --> 13:46.475
You don't know
what you're walking into.

13:46.507 --> 13:47.542
This could be a trap.

13:47.576 --> 13:50.145
I want to find out
if it's real or not. Right?

13:50.178 --> 13:51.779
Yeah.

13:51.813 --> 13:54.616
John, you're not Jason fucking
Bourne. This isn't a movie.

13:54.649 --> 13:56.418
We're just going to take
a look, right?

13:56.451 --> 13:58.653
-We?
-Yeah. You're ready, man?

13:58.685 --> 14:02.023
Yeah, man, ready
as Jason fucking Bourne.

14:02.057 --> 14:04.493
Let's drive the girls
home first. See? Safety first.

14:04.525 --> 14:06.094
-Safety first.
-Come on.

14:08.429 --> 14:11.165
What time is it?
Is he even online?

14:11.198 --> 14:12.601
About 7 a.m.

14:12.634 --> 14:14.236
He should be.

14:18.305 --> 14:20.207
-Hey, Katie! Hey, Morgan!
-Hey!

14:20.241 --> 14:22.343
-How are you?
-We're good.

14:22.376 --> 14:24.311
-How's Diane?
-Diane's fine.

14:24.345 --> 14:27.816
Everything ok over there?

14:27.848 --> 14:30.184
Yeah, I'm bored as hell
since they took me off the line.

14:30.217 --> 14:32.386
We're thrilled
that you are at a desk now

14:32.419 --> 14:34.423
and everything's blown over,
it's great.

14:34.456 --> 14:37.491
It's all behind us.
So how are you guys?

14:37.525 --> 14:38.592
We're good.

14:38.625 --> 14:41.730
You didn't send us anything,
did you? Like a package?

14:41.763 --> 14:44.066
No, I'm sorry, guys.
I've been so busy lately.

14:44.098 --> 14:45.400
I'll send you something soon.

14:45.433 --> 14:47.235
No, no, Dad. It's fine.
It's just...

14:47.268 --> 14:50.505
I got something from Afghanistan
but there was no letter.

14:50.538 --> 14:51.840
Just a DVD.

14:51.872 --> 14:53.674
No, that wasn't me.
What DVD?

14:53.707 --> 14:56.178
I didn't really watch
the whole thing.

14:56.211 --> 14:59.214
It was just some shitty thriller
about a kidnapping, I think.

14:59.246 --> 15:01.650
Maybe you ended up on someone's
mailing list by mistake.

15:01.683 --> 15:03.452
A lot of guys send
that stuff home.

15:03.485 --> 15:05.553
-Yeah...
-But this came from his base.

15:05.587 --> 15:07.722
Yeah, it came
from your base, Dad.

15:07.755 --> 15:10.792
-Really? And no name?
-No.

15:10.824 --> 15:13.594
Someone must have mixed up
the addresses.

15:14.696 --> 15:17.365
You know what, Dad? Don't worry
about it. We're fine.

15:17.398 --> 15:19.835
It's just a stupid video.

15:19.867 --> 15:21.569
<i>Colonel?
They're ready for you.</i>

15:21.602 --> 15:24.106
Ok, guys, look, I gotta go.

15:24.139 --> 15:26.341
But call me on our usual time
on the weekend, ok?

15:26.374 --> 15:29.244
Ok. And, Dad, be careful
out there. We love you.

15:31.246 --> 15:34.216
-It's pretty quiet where I am.
-Good.

15:34.249 --> 15:37.185
-Love you, guys!
-Love you, Dad.

15:37.217 --> 15:38.352
Bye!

15:38.385 --> 15:41.155
Kate!
You totally downplayed it.

15:41.188 --> 15:43.257
Why didn't you tell him
what the video really is?

15:43.290 --> 15:45.426
I told you,
I didn't want him to worry.

15:45.459 --> 15:47.128
He has enough to worry about.

15:47.161 --> 15:49.630
Yeah, like writing protocol
manuals is stressful?

15:49.664 --> 15:51.799
-Come on!
-What?

16:12.187 --> 16:13.322
<i>Come on!</i>

16:23.364 --> 16:27.669
Just let me out!
Let me out of this...

16:30.505 --> 16:33.341
Just...

16:33.374 --> 16:35.710
I didn't do anything to you.

16:35.742 --> 16:39.948
I don't even know you.
You don't know me.

16:39.981 --> 16:43.751
I didn't do anything!

16:46.888 --> 16:49.291
Why are you filming this?

16:49.323 --> 16:52.160
<i>Because I'm putting on a show.</i>

16:54.294 --> 16:56.798
Let me turn this thing on.

16:56.831 --> 16:58.767
I can't see shit in here.

16:58.799 --> 17:01.236
Hey, hey, hey! Dude, make sure
you shoot everything, ok?

17:01.269 --> 17:03.638
We can't miss anything.
Kate is gonna fucking kill me.

17:03.670 --> 17:04.805
Kate is going to fucking
kill you?

17:04.839 --> 17:07.742
Kate will fucking kill me.
She'll fucking take my balls

17:07.775 --> 17:09.343
and eat them.

17:09.377 --> 17:11.746
It's my fucking girlfriend!
Fucking smarten up, man!

17:11.778 --> 17:16.684
Where the fuck is this place?
I don't know.

17:16.717 --> 17:19.253
-You said you knew this place.
-Yeah, but I mean...

17:19.286 --> 17:20.621
Not in the dark.

17:20.655 --> 17:22.656
Who trains cross-country
in the fucking dark?

17:22.689 --> 17:27.996
Yeah, Rhys, this is so scary.
I think I'm gonna shit my pants.

17:28.028 --> 17:30.464
You're the one who was
all gung ho. You drove us here.

17:30.497 --> 17:33.567
Chill out, man. Morgan's right.
You can film for shit.

17:33.601 --> 17:34.835
Just hold this steady.

17:34.869 --> 17:37.405
Morgan's right. Kate's right.
Next time I need to take a shit,

17:37.438 --> 17:39.440
I'll be sure to consult you
on how to wipe my ass!

17:39.474 --> 17:40.842
Will you get a grip?

17:40.874 --> 17:43.410
We're supposed
to be paying attention.

17:43.444 --> 17:45.880
Right! We're on a mission.

17:45.912 --> 17:48.816
Why was it even sent to Kate?

17:48.850 --> 17:51.486
Fuck! I think this is it.

18:00.495 --> 18:02.531
Right or left?

18:04.364 --> 18:05.733
I don't know.

18:05.766 --> 18:08.370
Left.

18:09.937 --> 18:12.640
-You're sure?
-Yeah, left.

18:23.784 --> 18:25.286
I think that's it.

18:28.989 --> 18:30.991
Come on, dude. Let's go.

18:31.025 --> 18:33.361
By the way,
watch out for bears.

18:33.393 --> 18:36.397
Maybe we should bring back
some berries.

18:36.430 --> 18:37.298
John! Christ!

18:42.704 --> 18:45.774
Gee! What are you doing?

18:45.806 --> 18:47.441
You didn't hear that?

18:47.475 --> 18:49.745
No.

18:52.647 --> 18:55.016
Holy shit!

18:58.820 --> 19:00.822
That's it.

19:00.854 --> 19:03.390
John! Relax, she could still be
in there.

19:03.423 --> 19:04.658
Dude, the whole thing
is a prank, man!

19:04.691 --> 19:08.362
It's just a show, all right?

19:08.396 --> 19:10.966
Holy...
Do you see the rope?

19:14.701 --> 19:16.371
Check it out. Check it out.

19:21.109 --> 19:23.445
It looks clean.

19:23.477 --> 19:25.546
No sign of blood or anything.

19:25.580 --> 19:27.515
What is that?

19:27.547 --> 19:30.551
Look! Look! Look!

19:30.584 --> 19:32.086
Is that blood?

19:32.120 --> 19:34.522
He left us something.
There has to be something.

19:34.554 --> 19:36.792
The movie ends here.

19:47.668 --> 19:50.505
Dude, she was here man.
This is real.

19:50.537 --> 19:52.540
Well, where is she?

19:59.112 --> 20:01.515
What the fuck?

20:01.548 --> 20:04.151
This is fucking real, man!
I swear to God.

20:04.185 --> 20:06.888
John! John!

20:06.920 --> 20:08.756
Is that...? It's a USB key.

20:08.790 --> 20:12.894
Ok. Let's go.

20:14.695 --> 20:16.498
Let's fucking go!

20:20.700 --> 20:22.403
Fuck, John!

20:22.437 --> 20:23.938
Run! Run! Run!

20:23.970 --> 20:26.407
Holy shit! Holy shit!

20:27.441 --> 20:29.044
John!

20:30.477 --> 20:32.046
John!

20:34.948 --> 20:37.151
My God!

20:37.185 --> 20:39.521
John!

20:55.803 --> 20:58.573
My God, John!

21:01.508 --> 21:03.544
My God! That was brilliant!

21:05.979 --> 21:07.848
Do you...

21:07.881 --> 21:11.052
Do you have... John, stop!

21:23.663 --> 21:25.166
<i>Hey! Get up!</i>

21:28.069 --> 21:29.504
<i>For you.</i>

21:32.506 --> 21:36.111
<i>It's fine. It's fine.</i>

22:38.738 --> 22:40.508
I'll do whatever you need.

23:02.763 --> 23:04.632
I'll do whatever you need!

23:05.632 --> 23:08.769
I'll do whatever you need!
I'll do whatever you need!

23:08.803 --> 23:10.572
You were pretty scared, Rhys.

23:10.604 --> 23:11.505
Yeah?

23:11.540 --> 23:14.776
Yeah, he was holding on to me
and stuff.

23:14.809 --> 23:17.579
Anyway. So, yeah, pop it in,
please.

23:17.611 --> 23:20.247
Be careful.
It might explode or something.

23:20.281 --> 23:21.683
What?

23:21.716 --> 23:23.918
That makes perfect logical
sense.

23:23.950 --> 23:26.353
Better be worth it.
We missed the party.

23:26.387 --> 23:28.723
You know
those nanotechnology things

23:28.755 --> 23:31.692
where you can make anything
explode anywhere...

23:31.726 --> 23:34.361
God!
Look at Einstein over there.

23:34.394 --> 23:37.731
Check this out.
That was a sarcastic remark.

23:37.765 --> 23:39.100
He actually doesn't think
you're Einstein.

23:39.132 --> 23:40.901
Guys! Sh, sh!

24:17.772 --> 24:19.640
What the hell was that?

24:19.673 --> 24:21.642
All right, kids, this guy is
fucked up. No doubt about it.

24:21.676 --> 24:23.378
What makes you say that?

24:23.410 --> 24:25.246
Hum, do you want to
watch it again?

24:25.278 --> 24:28.082
No. I just don't think we can
assume to much about this guy

24:28.114 --> 24:29.182
without knowing more.

24:29.216 --> 24:31.785
This guy's some fucked-up
pervert.

24:31.819 --> 24:36.090
It doesn't make any sense. It
has no connection with the girl.

24:36.122 --> 24:39.693
He just wants you to go out
and find something.

24:39.726 --> 24:42.697
He's messing with your head.
Would you stop eating my nuts?

24:42.729 --> 24:44.931
Dude, I can eat...
It's not your fucking house.

24:44.965 --> 24:48.803
Well...
His plan is working so far.

24:48.835 --> 24:50.837
What do you mean?

24:50.871 --> 24:52.806
Well, you guys went
to the trail.

24:52.840 --> 24:54.175
Don't tell me
you're not thinking about going

24:54.207 --> 24:55.743
to the bathroom stall tomorrow.

24:55.775 --> 24:57.778
I want to go to Escape
tomorrow.

24:57.812 --> 24:59.246
Rhys, what are you doing?

25:01.381 --> 25:03.685
-What are you doing?
-What? Sorry! Nothing.

25:03.717 --> 25:05.753
Ok. We have to check the stall.

25:05.785 --> 25:07.788
-No!
-Why not?

25:07.822 --> 25:10.024
The video ends with a shot
of the last stall.

25:10.056 --> 25:12.192
That's where the next clue is.
Clues?

25:12.226 --> 25:13.960
What are you not getting?

25:13.994 --> 25:15.295
This guy's just messing
with us.

25:15.329 --> 25:17.932
It could be real, I guess.

25:17.965 --> 25:20.435
Fine, but who goes?

25:20.467 --> 25:23.403
Excuse me.

25:23.437 --> 25:25.406
That wasn't me volunteering
by the way!

25:25.438 --> 25:29.110
Ok, fine. We'll go.
Are you in?

25:29.142 --> 25:30.877
We'll go tomorrow.

25:30.910 --> 25:33.747
Can we go to the party now?

26:39.412 --> 26:42.416
<i>Olé! Olé! Olé!</i>

26:55.830 --> 26:59.567
What? Look at this?

26:59.600 --> 27:03.071
-Yo! What the fuck, dude?
-Sorry! Sorry! Yeah, Ok.

27:07.440 --> 27:09.009
Yes, John!

27:29.596 --> 27:34.368
You always come to party
and sit... on your thumb.

27:36.903 --> 27:40.207
So and then the camera turns
and there's this girl

27:40.240 --> 27:41.908
and she's tied up
to this little house.

27:41.941 --> 27:44.911
And she's beaten up and she
looks like she's about to die.

27:44.945 --> 27:48.115
Morgan! Stop!
Come here. Come here.

27:48.148 --> 27:50.384
-Ok.
-Come. Come. Follow me.

27:50.417 --> 27:52.220
What?

27:52.253 --> 27:54.121
Morgan, listen. You can't be
telling people about this?

27:54.153 --> 27:56.857
-Why not?
-We haven't figured it out yet.

27:56.890 --> 27:58.926
We don't want other people
involved.

27:58.958 --> 28:00.894
-I can tell whoever I want.
-Morgan!

28:00.928 --> 28:04.165
Rhys! The DVD
came to my sister.

28:04.198 --> 28:05.932
-So?
-It doesn't involve you at all.

28:05.966 --> 28:07.400
What are you ta... I'm inv...

28:07.434 --> 28:09.937
How do you guys say
that I'm not involved anymore?

28:09.969 --> 28:12.372
You just think
that it's a joke anyway.

28:12.406 --> 28:14.041
If I thought
that it was a joke,

28:14.073 --> 28:15.409
I wouldn't be dragging you
out here

28:15.441 --> 28:17.111
saying you shouldn't be
talking about it.

28:25.419 --> 28:28.255
<i>It's killing all of us.</i>

28:49.575 --> 28:51.344
...playing with an empty pack.

28:51.378 --> 28:53.313
'Cause I thought
there were cigarettes.

28:53.346 --> 28:54.915
I don't even smoke.

28:54.948 --> 28:56.616
"Cigarettes
are the cause of cancer."

28:56.650 --> 29:00.220
What was that all about
with Morgan? What's going on?

29:00.254 --> 29:03.457
She was talking about the stall
and the USB thing

29:03.489 --> 29:05.492
and I told her not to do it.
Who cares?

29:05.525 --> 29:08.028
-What do you mean, "who cares"?
-You're so serious about this.

29:08.062 --> 29:10.630
Yeah, I mean
it's a serious thing, right?

29:10.663 --> 29:13.934
Hey! We got a prankster
after us!

29:15.669 --> 29:19.006
-We got a loony man after us!
-A goddamn loon!

29:39.560 --> 29:44.098
I'm still getting a lot of
sweet footage from all this?

29:44.130 --> 29:47.567
Yeah. We might get something
we might've missed before.

29:47.601 --> 29:51.237
Plus it's better than Rhys
filming you on your skateboard.

29:51.271 --> 29:54.108
Hey! My skateboarding...

29:57.210 --> 29:59.246
Hey, Julia.

30:00.546 --> 30:03.683
In the crapper?

30:03.717 --> 30:06.153
Really, ladies?

30:07.653 --> 30:09.189
Jesus!

30:11.025 --> 30:13.460
Pff! A crapper?

30:17.398 --> 30:20.034
The last stall.

30:20.066 --> 30:23.603
Ok, Morgan, get a shot
of the whole thing!

30:23.637 --> 30:25.106
Ok.

30:27.573 --> 30:29.275
We're missing something.

30:29.309 --> 30:31.145
Someone sent us here
for a reason.

30:31.178 --> 30:33.280
Yeah! To fuck with us!

30:33.313 --> 30:35.082
No. 'Cause then it'll be over.

30:35.114 --> 30:37.083
It would be a lot of effort
to have it end here

30:37.117 --> 30:39.086
in the girls' washroom.

30:39.119 --> 30:40.388
Ok.

30:40.420 --> 30:42.088
Gross.

30:42.121 --> 30:44.292
Wait.
What?

30:46.726 --> 30:48.195
What is it?

30:48.227 --> 30:51.164
It's another USB key.

30:51.198 --> 30:55.136
-Ok. Let's go!
-Ok.

31:32.840 --> 31:35.810
So, let's see this USB key.

31:35.842 --> 31:38.245
Why? It's just a USB.

31:38.277 --> 31:40.647
Can I just see it?

31:45.486 --> 31:46.853
What the hell?

31:46.887 --> 31:48.656
It's one of the "scanny"
thingies.

31:48.688 --> 31:51.859
-My phone can't do that.
-Yeah, me neither.

31:51.891 --> 31:52.927
John's can.

31:52.959 --> 31:55.129
When we get to the water park,
he can scan this.

32:04.871 --> 32:09.209
Are you kidding me?
Jesus! Yes!

32:09.243 --> 32:12.679
Damn! That's nice!
That's serious.

32:13.913 --> 32:16.150
All right, ladies.
A little too young.

32:25.492 --> 32:28.295
There he is! Rhys!

32:28.328 --> 32:30.598
What the hell is he doing?

32:30.630 --> 32:33.234
That's right.

32:33.266 --> 32:35.268
Hello?

32:35.302 --> 32:37.303
Hello! Awesome!
You guys made it.

32:37.336 --> 32:38.638
John's at the Bowl.

32:38.671 --> 32:40.240
Should we go?

32:40.274 --> 32:44.611
Yes! Let's go!

32:44.644 --> 32:46.346
Take this.

32:46.380 --> 32:49.183
Yeah, yeah! This too.

32:49.216 --> 32:51.318
Here take it! Take it!
Take it!

32:54.388 --> 32:55.890
When you're free
we'll need your phone.

32:55.922 --> 32:59.292
-Sorry, I'll be off in 15.
-15, great! I love you.

32:59.325 --> 33:00.193
Hey! What are you doing?

33:02.329 --> 33:05.299
Holy shit!

33:05.332 --> 33:10.737
Wow!

33:10.771 --> 33:14.408
God! I can't breathe!

33:21.848 --> 33:24.452
I'm fucking dying.
I'm fucking dying.

33:26.320 --> 33:28.156
Yes!

33:30.323 --> 33:32.226
Did you catch that shit?

33:35.329 --> 33:37.698
Hey, I think she just stole
that chair.

33:43.303 --> 33:45.305
I think you could
probably be a model.

33:45.339 --> 33:47.675
No shit.

33:47.707 --> 33:49.810
-Hey!
-Hey, John!

33:49.842 --> 33:53.279
-Smile for the camera, bitch.
-What's up?

33:53.313 --> 33:54.415
Check it out.

33:54.448 --> 33:56.717
-Sweet. What is it?
-It's a QR card.

33:56.749 --> 33:58.952
What? This is crazy!

33:58.986 --> 34:01.354
He took the time to make this
look like a USB key.

34:01.388 --> 34:02.856
We don't know if it's a he?

34:02.889 --> 34:04.725
Why? You think a girl did this?

34:04.757 --> 34:07.294
Hey, girls can be just
as sick as guys.

34:07.326 --> 34:08.996
Yeah, no shit!

34:09.027 --> 34:11.797
-Yeah.
-"First Blood"?

34:11.831 --> 34:15.202
-The Rambo movie?
-Ok.

34:16.402 --> 34:17.771
What is that?

34:17.803 --> 34:20.239
Is that a finger?
That's a finger.

34:20.273 --> 34:21.808
Fucking looks real, man.

34:21.842 --> 34:26.380
-What's it in?
-In a chess case?

34:26.411 --> 34:27.213
Maybe it's a link.

34:27.246 --> 34:30.717
Hum. Website
for the Northside Mall.

34:32.418 --> 34:34.420
-What time does the mall close?
-Really? Seriously, guys?

35:03.749 --> 35:06.519
Very much.
I would appreciate it.

35:08.689 --> 35:12.393
No, no, no,
I can't wait until...

35:12.425 --> 35:15.295
No, no, I really need to
get out tonight.

35:15.329 --> 35:17.997
It has to be tonight.

35:18.030 --> 35:21.367
No, I get
where you're coming from,

35:21.401 --> 35:22.903
I understand, I do...

35:22.936 --> 35:25.673
Look, we just had a death
in the family

35:25.706 --> 35:27.675
and I really need
to get out tonight.

35:27.707 --> 35:31.445
It's imperative
that I get out tonight, please.

35:31.477 --> 35:33.947
I just...
Whatever you can find.

35:43.423 --> 35:46.392
So text us
if you find anything?

35:46.425 --> 35:48.394
Yes, ma'am!

35:48.427 --> 35:49.696
And if anything weird happens.

35:49.729 --> 35:51.564
Ok, so go ahead
and define "weird"

35:51.597 --> 35:53.333
under these circumstances.

35:53.367 --> 35:55.436
Do we even know
what we're looking for?

35:55.468 --> 36:00.506
Anything out of the ordinary,
like... a finger in a VHS case.

36:00.539 --> 36:04.410
Right. Ok.

36:04.443 --> 36:06.512
So what's going on
with you and Kate?

36:06.546 --> 36:08.982
I don't know, man. I've
been asking myself that too.

36:09.014 --> 36:10.717
You fuck her or what?

36:10.751 --> 36:12.619
No, that's the problem.

36:12.651 --> 36:14.921
Man, you have a reputation
at stake here, don't you?

36:14.954 --> 36:16.155
What are you talking about?

36:16.189 --> 36:18.425
Dude! She's gonna be watching
this footage, you know that?

36:18.457 --> 36:20.794
Yeah! Sorry, Kate,
I'm just kidding. We love you!

36:22.628 --> 36:25.131
I guess it would help if we knew
what we were looking for.

36:25.164 --> 36:26.933
VHS should be in the back.

36:29.403 --> 36:31.405
Excuse me.
Sorry.

36:31.438 --> 36:34.874
Excuse me! See?
VHS clearance sale.

36:37.811 --> 36:39.613
Take this side.
I'll take this side.

36:39.646 --> 36:41.548
Awesome!

36:41.581 --> 36:44.985
<i>Blood and Sweat. Eat Dirt.
Awesome.</i>

36:45.017 --> 36:47.553
Don't just toss them aside.
We might miss something.

36:47.586 --> 36:49.489
Especially because we know
what we're looking for.

36:49.523 --> 36:51.091
Holy shit!
What?

36:51.124 --> 36:54.495
<i>Holy shit! Dude, Devilution 9.</i>

36:54.528 --> 36:57.097
What? I thought
there were only 8.

36:57.130 --> 37:00.099
There were.
That's gotta be fake, for sure.

37:00.133 --> 37:02.903
Shit, dude!
We're on the back of that!

37:02.936 --> 37:04.537
What?

37:04.570 --> 37:05.773
Open it!

37:05.805 --> 37:08.141
Not in here.

37:08.175 --> 37:09.743
You're gonna buy it?

37:09.776 --> 37:11.645
Can I even buy this?

37:11.677 --> 37:14.013
We have to take this.

37:14.046 --> 37:16.483
Fuck that! You can take it,
expert criminal.

37:16.515 --> 37:18.452
I can't. It will be
a 3rd strike for me.

37:18.485 --> 37:20.586
I'm not doing it.

37:20.619 --> 37:23.456
Man, we need this.
I can't do it. Just take it.

37:23.490 --> 37:26.494
-He's standing right there.
-Give me that!

37:28.461 --> 37:30.496
We're just customers.
We're not doing anything wrong.

37:30.530 --> 37:33.167
Take the damn thing!
Put it in your bag right now.

37:33.200 --> 37:36.203
You fucking owe me!
You fucking owe me!

37:36.235 --> 37:37.537
Jesus, John!

37:41.006 --> 37:42.610
Act cool! Act cool!

37:55.622 --> 37:57.457
Hey! Just in time.
We found it.

37:58.657 --> 38:01.661
<i>-Devilution 9?
-There is no Devolution 9.</i>

38:01.695 --> 38:03.597
What makes you so sure
that it's from him?

38:03.630 --> 38:08.901
Look! Do you see that?
That is us!

38:08.934 --> 38:10.503
You've got to be
pretty fucking close

38:10.537 --> 38:12.573
to get a picture like that.

38:12.606 --> 38:15.776
Do you understand the amount
of time and effort

38:15.809 --> 38:18.144
it even takes
to make something like this?

38:18.177 --> 38:20.179
This guy's not fucking around.

38:20.213 --> 38:22.649
We need to stop giving
this guy what he wants!

38:22.682 --> 38:23.950
How about we see
what's on the tape?

38:23.983 --> 38:25.452
It's here. Let's just do it.

38:28.622 --> 38:30.491
Ok. Here we go.

38:46.273 --> 38:47.575
<i>Look at you.</i>

38:49.709 --> 38:52.546
<i>Ok. Hi there!</i>

38:54.213 --> 38:56.249
<i>You're feeling those drugs?</i>

39:01.121 --> 39:03.557
<i>Yeah, I think so.</i>

39:07.626 --> 39:09.662
<i>Yeah, I think so.</i>

39:12.064 --> 39:14.267
<i>Now, this shouldn't hurt
too much.</i>

39:16.669 --> 39:17.771
<i>It's for your own good.</i>

39:17.803 --> 39:20.573
God! God!

39:24.577 --> 39:26.514
No!

39:30.950 --> 39:33.719
<i>Aaaah!</i>

40:35.081 --> 40:37.950
Ok. No, no, no, no.
No way, that was real.

40:37.983 --> 40:39.151
There's no way that was real.

40:39.184 --> 40:41.087
I don't know, man.
It looks pretty real.

40:41.121 --> 40:43.389
Why can't we go to the cops?

40:43.423 --> 40:45.258
The worse that can happen is
that this is fake

40:45.291 --> 40:47.727
and we look like idiots
but at least it'll be over.

40:47.760 --> 40:49.095
I don't know what to do.

40:49.128 --> 40:51.097
I don't want to get
my dad involved.

40:51.131 --> 40:53.767
This is obviously just
a game to him, right?

40:55.334 --> 40:58.137
Ok. So let's say we do go
to the cops, then what?

40:58.171 --> 41:00.807
I just know that getting
the cops involved is a bad idea.

41:00.840 --> 41:03.376
He's gonna fucking kill us,
girl, if we go to the cops!

41:03.410 --> 41:06.913
Guys, you should be
holding hands.

41:06.945 --> 41:10.316
Guys, I have a feeling
that this is over.

41:10.349 --> 41:14.954
We've no more leads.
What else could possibly happen?

41:17.289 --> 41:19.892
You couldn't really tell where
the girl was in that video.

41:19.925 --> 41:22.361
It looked underground.
No windows or anything.

41:22.394 --> 41:24.030
Yeah, maybe.

41:24.064 --> 41:26.233
I'm going inside.
Are you guys coming?

41:26.265 --> 41:28.267
-Yeah.
-No, I gotta get home.

41:30.836 --> 41:34.974
-Ok. Well... I'll see you.
-Ok.

41:36.776 --> 41:38.712
Wow.

41:40.213 --> 41:43.717
-Just... not now, ok?
-Why not?

41:43.749 --> 41:45.851
Just not now!

41:45.885 --> 41:48.689
-Ok. Never, right?
-Don't be a jerk.

41:48.722 --> 41:50.990
You're the one
jerking me around.

41:51.023 --> 41:53.759
John... just don't...

41:53.793 --> 41:55.729
What the hell is the matter
with you?

41:58.831 --> 42:00.800
I'll see you.

42:00.834 --> 42:02.869
Will you stop filming this!

42:02.901 --> 42:04.804
Jesus Christ!

42:12.878 --> 42:15.314
-I'm sorry, Kate.
-It's ok.

42:15.347 --> 42:18.418
It's not his fault. I'm
just messed up from all of it.

42:18.450 --> 42:20.186
It's pretty fucked up.

42:20.220 --> 42:23.790
I'm not going to the cops
though 'cause it's fake.

42:23.822 --> 42:27.193
I'm sure it's one of John's exes
trying to fuck with him.

42:27.227 --> 42:29.162
Or get revenge on me.

42:31.331 --> 42:34.735
-It's not a bad theory.
-You hadn't thought of that yet?

42:34.767 --> 42:37.737
I thought you were the one in
all those conspiracy theories.

42:37.771 --> 42:41.173
Yeah, but Kate, this is
seriously like fucked up.

42:41.206 --> 42:43.275
I think the girl in the video
is actually in trouble.

42:43.309 --> 42:44.778
Morgan, it's fake!

42:44.811 --> 42:47.213
Ok, but have you seen Diane
lately?

42:47.247 --> 42:48.782
She's been gone for 2 days.

42:48.814 --> 42:50.818
When was the last time
you saw her?

42:52.952 --> 42:55.188
Like... 2 days ago.

42:55.220 --> 42:58.958
She came in here and asked us
if we needed anything.

43:03.930 --> 43:05.398
Voicemail.

43:05.430 --> 43:07.166
Hey, Diane, it's Kate.

43:07.200 --> 43:09.803
Just checking in. We haven't
seen you in a couple of days.

43:09.836 --> 43:11.872
Give us a call. Bye!

43:13.273 --> 43:14.841
You don't think she has
something to do

43:14.874 --> 43:17.910
with all this weird shit
going on.

43:17.943 --> 43:20.380
Get over your theories.

43:20.412 --> 43:22.515
I'm going to bed.

43:25.318 --> 43:27.121
Don't wake me up
unless someone dies.

44:42.160 --> 44:47.233
So get this. We went in.
The cop spotted.

44:47.267 --> 44:50.570
I don't know, man. I think,
they think it's real so...

44:50.602 --> 44:52.872
Of course,
they think it's real.

44:52.905 --> 44:54.541
We were just there for 3 hours.

44:54.573 --> 44:57.010
They're gonna investigate
is what I am saying.

44:57.043 --> 44:58.410
This is for your documentation

44:58.443 --> 45:00.913
or whatever
you're fucking doing.

45:00.947 --> 45:03.182
-This is going to be gold.
-You think so?

45:03.215 --> 45:05.885
Yeah, man. Everything in our
lives is happening for a reason.

45:05.918 --> 45:08.954
What are you gonna do
with this footage?

45:08.988 --> 45:12.058
Worst case, we'll just show it
to our grandkids.

45:12.090 --> 45:13.525
"Hey, when we were younger,

45:13.559 --> 45:16.463
"we has this psychopath
sending us VHS tapes

45:16.496 --> 45:18.898
of a woman getting fucking
slaughtered."

45:18.932 --> 45:20.901
Does that happen to anyone?

45:20.934 --> 45:23.003
-I like that.
-Really? Does that happen?

45:23.035 --> 45:24.104
I don't think so, no.

45:24.137 --> 45:27.274
It's good
that we're filming this...

45:32.144 --> 45:34.914
So, John and I came
forward this morning

45:34.947 --> 45:37.917
and now the cops
are checking it out so...

45:39.519 --> 45:42.055
Like I said, we should have
gone to them sooner.

45:42.088 --> 45:43.390
You actually think

45:43.423 --> 45:45.325
it's just some jealous chick
doing all this?

45:45.358 --> 45:46.660
Without a doubt.

45:46.693 --> 45:48.595
I'm not completely convinced.

45:48.628 --> 45:52.564
No, of course not. Miss
Conspiracy herself over here.

45:52.597 --> 45:54.700
Diane's been gone
for like 3 days.

45:54.733 --> 45:57.202
And I'm sure you're loving
the freedom.

45:57.235 --> 45:59.038
Jesus, I wish my mom
would just disappear.

45:59.072 --> 46:00.907
Stepmom, actually.

46:02.008 --> 46:04.678
Morgan here thinks that this
is all Diane's doing,

46:04.711 --> 46:06.947
the videos and stuff.

46:06.979 --> 46:10.050
Which makes absolutely no sense
in the real world!

46:14.320 --> 46:16.523
I am kind of concerned
that she's just gone.

46:16.555 --> 46:18.457
It's a little bit flaky.

46:18.490 --> 46:21.126
But Morgan's never really
liked her.

46:21.160 --> 46:23.430
Could she have said something
that drove her away?

46:23.463 --> 46:24.698
Guys, come!

46:24.731 --> 46:26.299
-What?
-Just come!

46:26.331 --> 46:28.067
Do we know them?

46:30.669 --> 46:33.173
-Hey, man!
-Hey.

46:33.206 --> 46:35.175
Where did you get
that T-shirt from?

46:35.207 --> 46:37.410
The concert last year.

46:37.443 --> 46:38.979
What concert?

46:39.012 --> 46:41.014
The one at Epwells Cemetery.

46:41.046 --> 46:43.282
Remember the cops came
and shut it down.

46:43.316 --> 46:45.986
Yeah! I remember that.

46:46.019 --> 46:48.021
It sounded really cool.
A lot of good local bands.

46:48.053 --> 46:52.224
Yeah! We got two hours
of awesome music before...

46:52.258 --> 46:54.327
before it got shut down.
It was a bummer.

46:54.360 --> 46:57.664
Kate, that's the shirt that
the girl in the video's wearing.

46:57.697 --> 46:59.499
I remember it
like super, super clear.

46:59.532 --> 47:01.267
-Really?
-Shit!

47:01.300 --> 47:03.003
Shit, Morgan, you're right!

47:03.035 --> 47:04.104
I know.

47:04.137 --> 47:07.640
"Epwells Cemetery was host
to a party last night,

47:07.673 --> 47:10.243
"which most of today's youth
would've referred to as a rave.

47:10.276 --> 47:13.013
Police were called and..."

47:13.046 --> 47:14.647
Shit! This is real.

47:14.680 --> 47:16.082
This is from last year.

47:17.316 --> 47:20.786
Look, they're the names of
the people who are buried here.

47:20.820 --> 47:24.189
You're not leaving me here
by myself.

47:24.222 --> 47:26.325
It's going to be a complete
waste of time anyway.

47:26.358 --> 47:28.360
You're too freaked out go.

47:28.394 --> 47:31.197
Fine.

47:31.229 --> 47:34.233
And, Rhys, you don't let her
out of your sight.

47:40.072 --> 47:43.009
Ok.
What are we supposed to do?

47:45.343 --> 47:48.247
I don't know.

47:51.150 --> 47:53.419
Rhys, look at this!

47:55.121 --> 47:58.057
Who the fuck puts a headless
angel on someone's tombstone?

47:58.090 --> 48:00.659
Rhys, obviously they didn't put
that on there to begin with.

48:00.693 --> 48:04.330
It just happened like...
a woodpecker came and...

48:04.363 --> 48:07.801
A woodpecker? Do you know what
a tombstone is made out of?

48:07.834 --> 48:10.102
Not wood, Kate.

48:14.840 --> 48:16.842
Hold on.

48:16.876 --> 48:19.178
What's up?

48:23.115 --> 48:26.218
Who is it?
Got a text from Diane.

48:26.251 --> 48:28.654
-What?
-It says...

48:28.688 --> 48:30.523
"You won't find me here."

48:30.555 --> 48:33.226
-Weird.
-What?

48:37.130 --> 48:40.166
"Where are you?"

48:40.198 --> 48:43.336
Well, at least,
she's risen from the dead.

48:43.369 --> 48:45.171
Lucky me.

48:45.204 --> 48:48.108
Why would she send
a weird text like that?

48:48.140 --> 48:50.510
She always does weird shit
like this.

48:50.543 --> 48:54.314
Is that her again?
What?

48:54.347 --> 48:56.850
-Look at this?
-What's up?

48:58.517 --> 48:59.686
What the fuck?

48:59.718 --> 49:02.255
How does she know where we are?

49:02.287 --> 49:04.523
Ok. I don't want to be here
anymore. Can we go?

49:05.657 --> 49:07.293
-My God!
-Kate?

49:07.325 --> 49:10.262
-Jesus, Morgan!
-Are you ok?

49:10.296 --> 49:11.731
What are you doing? You bitch!

49:11.764 --> 49:14.166
-Kate?
-You've been terrorizing us!

49:14.200 --> 49:15.702
I tried calling the house
a few times.

49:15.735 --> 49:18.470
You guys haven't been home much.
I lost my cell.

49:18.503 --> 49:20.439
What is he doing
with the camera?

49:20.472 --> 49:24.878
-I know it's you!
-Kate! Her mom just died.

49:24.910 --> 49:28.148
I've been at my sister's
for the past couple of nights.

49:28.180 --> 49:30.416
She's a mess.
You didn't call our cells.

49:30.448 --> 49:32.784
Like I said, I lost my phone.

49:32.818 --> 49:34.821
No numbers up here.

49:34.854 --> 49:36.890
And you guys don't answer
the home phone.

49:36.923 --> 49:40.494
I'm sorry
if it was worrying you.

49:42.327 --> 49:45.264
So... your mom?

49:45.298 --> 49:48.735
Yeah. It was very sudden.

49:50.235 --> 49:51.403
So it wasn't your text?

49:51.436 --> 49:55.174
I could have sworn I left
my phone on the kitchen counter.

49:55.207 --> 49:57.711
We looked everywhere.
It's definitely not here.

50:01.646 --> 50:03.215
Ok. So let's see these texts.

50:03.249 --> 50:05.718
Man, you know how fucking
freaky that was?

50:05.751 --> 50:08.421
It was as if she knew exactly
where we were the entire time.

50:08.454 --> 50:09.555
Well,
it couldn't have been her,

50:09.588 --> 50:11.890
I was with her the whole time
looking for her phone.

50:11.923 --> 50:14.259
You guys seemed pretty chummy
when I got back.

50:14.293 --> 50:16.329
Because I felt sorry for her.

50:16.361 --> 50:18.331
So if it's not her
and she left her phone here

50:18.363 --> 50:19.731
and now it's not here.

50:19.764 --> 50:22.868
You're sounding like me, Kate.

50:24.436 --> 50:25.871
So there's nothing
at the cemetery?

50:25.905 --> 50:27.840
No. Just those texts
you're looking at.

50:27.872 --> 50:29.275
Nothing that we could see.

50:29.307 --> 50:31.343
Not that we really stuck around
for very long.

53:52.144 --> 53:55.448
Kate? Is that you?

54:37.490 --> 54:40.560
-God!
-Damn it, Harris!

54:52.637 --> 54:56.808
He! He!

55:07.686 --> 55:11.122
-Harris!
-Diane.

55:11.155 --> 55:13.793
-What are you doing?
-You know what I'm doing.

55:13.825 --> 55:16.963
Please, just stop.

55:16.996 --> 55:18.497
I can help you.

55:19.264 --> 55:22.567
Harris!
We're on the same team.

55:22.601 --> 55:25.505
Oliver, he's suffering too.

55:25.537 --> 55:29.108
Oliver didn't want
anyone to die.

55:29.140 --> 55:30.976
Do you know what he was?

55:33.012 --> 55:37.484
He was a traitor.
Your daddy was a traitor.

55:39.251 --> 55:41.955
Do you have any idea what
he did to us, they did to us?

55:43.122 --> 55:47.660
Blowtorch, scissors,
nail gun, pliers...

55:47.693 --> 55:50.597
Olivier's got us captured.

55:52.631 --> 55:53.599
He had to.

55:53.631 --> 55:57.669
You should know that.
More than anybody else.

56:00.773 --> 56:02.675
He had a choice.

56:02.707 --> 56:04.677
When I was sitting there...

56:04.709 --> 56:08.613
When I was sitting there, Diane,
being tortured,

56:08.646 --> 56:11.683
I realized that I was paying
the price for some guy,

56:11.717 --> 56:15.555
who decided
to abandon his men.

56:15.588 --> 56:17.790
Yeah, maybe he saved
some civilians,

56:17.822 --> 56:20.091
but that's not the point
because he gave me his word

56:20.124 --> 56:23.929
he would back me up to the end!

56:24.997 --> 56:27.300
And then when I was lucky
to escape with my life,

56:27.332 --> 56:31.803
I realized that I had
my own personal mission.

56:31.836 --> 56:34.105
That I would show him

56:34.139 --> 56:37.876
what it's
like to lose everything!

56:37.910 --> 56:41.280
You're sick! You need help!

57:20.653 --> 57:23.622
Thanks for coming.
She's a bit calmer now.

57:23.655 --> 57:24.823
But she didn't want me
to call the cops.

57:24.856 --> 57:26.257
And I didn't know
what else to do.

57:26.291 --> 57:29.327
You're the only person
she wanted to see so...

57:29.360 --> 57:33.298
Kate?

57:35.434 --> 57:38.938
Hey! I'm glad you called.

57:44.809 --> 57:47.112
Thank you.

57:47.146 --> 57:49.115
Everything's gonna be ok,
all right?

57:49.148 --> 57:52.218
He took her!

57:52.251 --> 57:54.120
Are you sure?

58:01.693 --> 58:04.930
Look at this!
Go to the next.

58:09.767 --> 58:12.204
"Tell anyone she's dead. Go
to the cops, your dad's next."

58:12.236 --> 58:14.706
Jesus Christ!
I don't know what to do!

58:14.740 --> 58:16.809
He's fucking dead!

58:18.142 --> 58:19.845
Go to the next one.

58:21.046 --> 58:22.214
"If you don't believe me..."

58:22.247 --> 58:23.916
-Did you scan this already?
-No.

58:53.845 --> 58:55.947
Relax.

59:00.952 --> 59:02.755
Feeling good?

59:11.530 --> 59:14.300
This won't hurt you.

59:16.802 --> 59:17.736
You won't feel a thing.

59:32.851 --> 59:37.724
You know they tortured us
for weeks and for weeks.

59:40.392 --> 59:42.160
Real slow.

59:58.010 --> 01:00:00.513
Yeah, you are definitely
fucked up.

01:00:35.546 --> 01:00:37.949
All three of you.

01:00:37.983 --> 01:00:40.052
Come to the water park.

01:00:40.084 --> 01:00:42.954
If you call the cops
or you don't show,

01:00:42.988 --> 01:00:44.957
Morgan will die slowly.

01:00:49.461 --> 01:00:51.930
Let's go!
Rhys, get your stuff!

01:00:51.963 --> 01:00:53.998
It's gonna be ok.

01:00:54.032 --> 01:00:57.937
-What? Right now?
-Yes! Let's go. Get your stuff.

01:01:18.256 --> 01:01:19.992
Fuck!

01:01:20.025 --> 01:01:25.363
Fuck you! Fuck you!
Fuck you!

01:02:25.456 --> 01:02:27.893
Holy shit! What is that?

01:02:34.566 --> 01:02:37.003
Ok. No matter what, we're
capturing everything, all right?

01:02:43.742 --> 01:02:45.510
What are we supposed to do?
Just look around?

01:02:45.543 --> 01:02:47.178
I don't know, Kate.

01:02:47.211 --> 01:02:49.514
Hey! Shouldn't the gate
be closed?

01:02:49.548 --> 01:02:52.517
Isn't there, like, security's
supposed to be here?

01:02:52.550 --> 01:02:53.952
Usually. Right here.

01:02:53.985 --> 01:02:56.454
Shit! The lights are on
at the Time Warp.

01:02:56.488 --> 01:02:59.558
So?

01:02:59.590 --> 01:03:01.960
I don't know, man.
That's where the lights are on.

01:03:01.994 --> 01:03:04.630
That's obviously where he is.

01:03:04.662 --> 01:03:08.534
Wait! Stop! Fuck!

01:03:32.157 --> 01:03:35.026
Wait! Wait! Wait!
Hold up. Hold up!

01:03:35.059 --> 01:03:38.063
John, that's a trap.

01:03:38.095 --> 01:03:40.099
Of course, it's a trap.

01:03:40.131 --> 01:03:43.369
This whole thing is a trap.
We need to go get her.

01:03:52.177 --> 01:03:54.213
So what? What does he want us
to do now?

01:03:54.246 --> 01:03:57.450
Kate, wait! Wait!

01:04:02.153 --> 01:04:04.088
Fuck!

01:04:04.122 --> 01:04:06.058
Seriously, though!

01:04:10.128 --> 01:04:12.564
Holy shit! There's a huge
drop over here.

01:04:20.405 --> 01:04:22.207
Shit!

01:04:26.711 --> 01:04:28.214
It's safe. Come on.

01:04:31.682 --> 01:04:35.220
It's gonna be fine, Kate.
My God! Really, John?

01:04:43.160 --> 01:04:45.097
All right, Rhys. Come on!

01:04:46.764 --> 01:04:49.434
Let's go! Come on!

01:04:58.276 --> 01:05:02.615
Fuck! There's another drop!
Be careful, all right?

01:05:12.724 --> 01:05:15.727
You ok?

01:05:15.760 --> 01:05:17.830
-Are you ok?
-All right, Kate?

01:05:22.233 --> 01:05:25.236
Jesus Christ!

01:05:25.269 --> 01:05:27.305
You're ok?

01:05:30.642 --> 01:05:33.111
Ok. We have to keep going.

01:05:35.146 --> 01:05:37.181
We're all gonna be fine,
all right?

01:05:37.215 --> 01:05:39.218
We're gonna find, Morgan.

01:05:52.731 --> 01:05:54.499
I'm gonna fucking kill
this guy when I see him.

01:05:57.602 --> 01:05:59.705
Rhys! What the fuck
are you doing?

01:05:59.738 --> 01:06:02.174
What the fuck
are we doing here, John?

01:06:02.206 --> 01:06:04.175
Are you kidding me, man?

01:06:04.209 --> 01:06:06.145
No, I mean, why can't...

01:06:06.177 --> 01:06:08.279
Morgan's out there right now!
He has her.

01:06:08.313 --> 01:06:10.282
Yes, all right!
...for help, John!

01:06:10.314 --> 01:06:11.282
Are you fucking kidding me?

01:06:11.316 --> 01:06:13.285
Did you see what he did
to that fucking girl?

01:06:13.318 --> 01:06:15.921
Smarten up,
you fucking idiot!

01:06:15.954 --> 01:06:18.890
Jesus Christ!
How selfish are you?

01:06:18.923 --> 01:06:22.327
It's her fucking sister!
Can you shut up, please?

01:06:24.296 --> 01:06:25.297
Fuck!

01:06:33.338 --> 01:06:36.175
What is that?
What's that sound?

01:06:37.508 --> 01:06:39.311
What is that?

01:06:40.477 --> 01:06:42.213
Holy shit!

01:07:31.662 --> 01:07:33.865
Kate?

01:07:41.305 --> 01:07:42.874
Are you ok?

01:07:50.548 --> 01:07:52.251
Are you ok?

01:08:10.401 --> 01:08:13.606
Morgan!

01:08:20.377 --> 01:08:22.014
-John, wait!
-Come on, guys!

01:08:22.046 --> 01:08:24.750
-John!
-Wait!

01:08:31.356 --> 01:08:33.524
Rhys, come on!

01:08:41.866 --> 01:08:43.301
Let's go!

01:09:15.733 --> 01:09:18.002
Where's he going?

01:09:27.444 --> 01:09:29.481
My...

01:09:32.450 --> 01:09:35.354
Fuck! Hold on! Fuck!

01:09:39.390 --> 01:09:42.928
What the fuck is out here?
Jesus Christ!

01:09:55.874 --> 01:10:00.545
Kate! Kate! Hold on! Kate!

01:10:01.478 --> 01:10:05.049
You try anything
and I will kill you.

01:10:05.082 --> 01:10:08.387
Now sit down! Sit down!

01:10:10.120 --> 01:10:12.857
-No!
-Sit down now!

01:10:12.890 --> 01:10:15.393
What is this?

01:10:15.427 --> 01:10:18.597
Let her go, please!
Thank you! Thank you!

01:10:21.131 --> 01:10:27.104
Rhys, take those handcuffs
and handcuff them to the wall.

01:10:27.138 --> 01:10:29.006
Did you hear me?

01:10:29.040 --> 01:10:32.544
Rhys? Rhys! Rhys!
Come on!

01:10:32.576 --> 01:10:34.946
Did you get that?
Rhys! Rhys! Rhys!

01:10:35.914 --> 01:10:38.450
Rhys! Come on! Rhys! Rhys!

01:10:38.482 --> 01:10:39.583
Stop!

01:10:39.616 --> 01:10:42.854
Don't, all right? Fuck!

01:10:44.888 --> 01:10:47.492
Here you go! Here you go!

01:10:48.860 --> 01:10:50.795
-No!
-Please!

01:10:53.164 --> 01:10:55.467
Come on! Come on!

01:11:01.638 --> 01:11:03.441
When you're in the field,

01:11:03.474 --> 01:11:07.611
what's the only thing you can do
to stay sane? The only thing?

01:11:07.644 --> 01:11:11.615
-I don't know.
-You follow the rules.

01:11:11.648 --> 01:11:13.718
But you gotta know
who's on your team.

01:11:15.519 --> 01:11:16.955
Maybe you gotta bend the rules,

01:11:16.987 --> 01:11:19.790
sometimes, for somebody
you care about,

01:11:19.823 --> 01:11:22.626
but your father, your father,

01:11:22.660 --> 01:11:24.930
he abandoned me during
a firefight.

01:11:24.963 --> 01:11:26.197
And this is what happens.

01:11:26.231 --> 01:11:29.000
Bet you never seen
a technique like this?

01:11:29.032 --> 01:11:30.535
What?

01:11:36.174 --> 01:11:40.178
Stop!

01:11:40.210 --> 01:11:42.546
Stop!

01:11:42.580 --> 01:11:44.649
No!

01:11:57.661 --> 01:11:59.697
Fuck!

01:11:59.731 --> 01:12:01.567
This way!

01:12:10.241 --> 01:12:11.776
Fuck, it's locked!

01:12:11.808 --> 01:12:15.580
We can't leave!
He's going to kill Morgan!

01:12:38.937 --> 01:12:41.773
No! Fuck!

01:12:41.805 --> 01:12:43.775
Get back! Get back!

01:12:43.808 --> 01:12:45.877
He's here.

01:12:45.910 --> 01:12:48.981
He's here. Stay down.

01:13:17.375 --> 01:13:20.812
Come on! Fuck!

01:13:20.844 --> 01:13:22.981
Fuck!

01:13:27.986 --> 01:13:29.555
Kate!

01:13:31.822 --> 01:13:33.691
No! No! No!

01:13:36.059 --> 01:13:38.228
Stop!

01:13:49.840 --> 01:13:51.308
No!

01:14:10.795 --> 01:14:12.965
Don't wake me up
unless someone dies.

01:14:32.784 --> 01:14:34.318
Don't let him near him!

01:14:34.352 --> 01:14:37.822
Don't film him!

01:14:37.854 --> 01:14:39.691
This is some good shots!

01:14:41.259 --> 01:14:43.795
How about a smile
for the camera, ladies?

01:14:43.827 --> 01:14:45.796
For Dad. A Christmas card.

01:14:45.830 --> 01:14:48.433
Stop filming me, you fuck!

01:14:48.465 --> 01:14:52.803
You filmed me.
It's the least I can do.

01:14:52.836 --> 01:14:55.139
We're like friends
on the Internet.

01:14:56.941 --> 01:14:58.843
How would you girls like
to make a call to Daddy?

01:14:58.875 --> 01:15:02.713
No! No, don't call him!

01:15:02.746 --> 01:15:06.684
Don't call him. Don't call him.

01:15:06.718 --> 01:15:10.220
Now's the time. And Daddy
is always on time, right?

01:15:10.254 --> 01:15:13.825
-No! Don't call Daddy.
-Daddy is always on time.

01:15:13.857 --> 01:15:16.860
-Don't call.
-Here we go.

01:15:23.267 --> 01:15:25.903
Dad! Please!

01:15:25.937 --> 01:15:28.439
My... Kate!

01:15:28.473 --> 01:15:31.843
Dad!
We're at Escape Water Park!

01:15:31.875 --> 01:15:33.445
Who did this?

01:15:33.478 --> 01:15:37.982
Colonel, sir! I think you know
what this is about, sir?

01:15:38.014 --> 01:15:39.383
You left us to be tortured.

01:15:39.416 --> 01:15:41.486
You let your men die.

01:15:41.518 --> 01:15:45.956
Your men!
I tried! You know I tried!

01:15:45.990 --> 01:15:48.793
I did everything I could!

01:15:48.826 --> 01:15:50.795
Stand down!

01:15:53.164 --> 01:15:55.767
Please, they've got nothing
to do with this.

01:15:55.799 --> 01:15:58.436
But they've got everything
to do with you!

01:15:58.469 --> 01:16:00.939
Stop!

01:16:00.972 --> 01:16:04.476
Let her go! Let her go!

01:16:04.509 --> 01:16:09.147
You got yourself
a handful here, sir!

01:16:09.179 --> 01:16:12.217
Chatty little things,
aren't they?

01:16:13.284 --> 01:16:16.987
Think about what you're doing?

01:16:17.021 --> 01:16:20.325
This is not the way.

01:16:20.357 --> 01:16:23.861
This is not the way.
Think about what you're doing.

01:16:23.894 --> 01:16:25.897
Harris, listen to me.
They're just children.

01:16:25.929 --> 01:16:26.964
They're just kids!

01:16:26.997 --> 01:16:31.268
Yeah, and so was Tomlin,
Vasquez and Franklin.

01:16:31.302 --> 01:16:34.171
<i>Just kids!
She's just a child.</i>

01:16:34.205 --> 01:16:36.040
<i>Get your hands off her!</i>

01:16:36.072 --> 01:16:38.809
<i>Get your hands off her!</i>

01:16:40.945 --> 01:16:45.983
<i>Harris!
Don't you touch her!</i>

01:16:46.017 --> 01:16:48.987
<i>Get your hands off her!</i>

01:16:53.057 --> 01:16:56.461
Sir! Sir!

01:16:56.494 --> 01:16:59.097
Are you looking, sir?

01:17:03.968 --> 01:17:05.937
No! No!

01:17:08.438 --> 01:17:11.543
God! No!

01:17:31.995 --> 01:17:34.932
I was raised to do
better than this.

01:17:34.965 --> 01:17:38.870
I was raised to do
better than this.

01:17:38.902 --> 01:17:41.939
Now look at me?

01:17:41.973 --> 01:17:43.508
Look at me now.

01:17:43.540 --> 01:17:45.610
Look at me now.

01:17:45.643 --> 01:17:48.847
You're proud of me now?

01:17:48.879 --> 01:17:50.581
It's too late, though...

01:17:52.983 --> 01:17:56.153
It's too fucking late.

01:17:56.187 --> 01:17:58.957
Sorry.
