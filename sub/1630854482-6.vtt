00:01.871 --> 00:05.135
<i>Previously on
"Criminal Minds: Evolution"...</i>

00:05.135 --> 00:06.354
I know my own rules.

00:06.354 --> 00:08.791
Your rules?
My rules.

00:08.791 --> 00:10.532
Don't you ever
forget that.

00:10.532 --> 00:13.839
How can I?

00:13.839 --> 00:15.189
We are pursuing
the leader

00:15.189 --> 00:17.713
of a network of serial killers.

00:17.713 --> 00:18.757
That's your sister.

00:18.757 --> 00:20.411
She went missing 15 years ago.

00:20.411 --> 00:23.371
You didn't join that network,
you infiltrated it.

00:23.371 --> 00:25.503
I know that you don't remember
what happened

00:25.503 --> 00:27.201
the night
Alison went missing.

00:27.201 --> 00:29.420
I know that all the important
details are, like, in this fog.

00:29.420 --> 00:31.074
What if I could
lift that fog?

00:31.074 --> 00:33.337
I want you to picture
your sister's face.

00:33.337 --> 00:35.078
Go back to the last time
you saw her.

00:35.078 --> 00:36.297
Tyler.

00:36.297 --> 00:37.602
Tyler!

00:37.602 --> 00:39.082
Alison's Boyfriend: Next time,

00:39.082 --> 00:40.431
you tell me if
your brother's going to be here.

00:40.431 --> 00:42.520
Alright.
What's wrong with you?

00:42.520 --> 00:44.914
Tyler Green: He was right there.
But I couldn't see him.

00:44.914 --> 00:47.003
- I couldn't see his face.
- Her boyfriend, Lee?

00:47.003 --> 00:49.745
Yes.
He's the one you're looking for.

00:49.745 --> 00:51.268
He's Sicarius?

00:51.268 --> 00:54.619
You and Rebecca?
You're so a thing.

00:54.619 --> 00:56.273
It is my first time
being this happy.

00:56.273 --> 00:57.709
Do what I tell you, Benjamin.

00:57.709 --> 00:59.494
The rules are there
for a reason.

00:59.494 --> 01:01.800
Follow them, and you won't have
to put a gun to your head.

01:01.800 --> 01:04.586
He calls 911.
I come running.

01:04.586 --> 01:06.283
Benjamin Reeves
just confessed

01:06.283 --> 01:08.546
to multiple murders
around the country.

01:08.546 --> 01:10.026
Benjamin Reeves:
Carmen Gomez from 2007.

01:10.026 --> 01:13.421
John Harris, Kalen Jones.
Should I keep going?

01:13.421 --> 01:16.380
He's naming names from
the Sicarius shipping container.

01:16.380 --> 01:18.426
None of those names
are public knowledge.

01:18.426 --> 01:20.602
You want to impress me,
tell me something I don't know.

01:20.602 --> 01:22.473
Whitfield County, Georgia.

01:22.473 --> 01:25.085
- What's out there?
- More buried treasure.

01:25.085 --> 01:26.695
Looks like
a storm cellar.

01:26.695 --> 01:29.132
We're going in.

01:29.132 --> 01:31.134
It's just like the other
shipping container.

01:32.440 --> 01:33.876
What the hell is that?

01:33.876 --> 01:34.877
Get out of there now!

01:34.877 --> 01:36.487
JJ, it's a bomb!
Run!

01:36.487 --> 01:38.359
- Oh, my God.
- Run!

01:40.448 --> 01:42.276
Luke? JJ?
Come in.

01:44.016 --> 01:45.453
Oh, no.

02:04.776 --> 02:06.474
- What was that?
- It was an explosion.

02:06.474 --> 02:08.040
Communications
are scrambled.

02:08.040 --> 02:09.433
- Backup there yet?
- Power's been knocked out.

02:09.433 --> 02:10.608
That means towers
are probably down.

02:10.608 --> 02:12.088
Comms might be out,

02:12.088 --> 02:13.655
but they still have on
those body cameras.

02:13.655 --> 02:15.961
That isn't connected
to any GPS, but--

02:15.961 --> 02:18.268
but if I can
reestablish the uplink...

02:28.670 --> 02:31.238
Oh! Oh!
One of the cameras is online.

02:49.604 --> 02:51.475
There's JJ.

02:51.475 --> 02:53.129
Where's Luke?

02:53.129 --> 02:55.349
I take back every mean thing
I ever said.

02:55.349 --> 02:57.002
Please let him be okay.

03:01.920 --> 03:03.705
We need to
get to Georgia now.

03:03.705 --> 03:05.489
I can dispatch
the Atlanta division.

03:05.489 --> 03:07.230
Douglas, it's time.

03:14.933 --> 03:16.152
JJ's back online.

03:16.152 --> 03:20.069
She's still looking
for Luke.

03:20.069 --> 03:22.158
Driving or...?

03:22.158 --> 03:24.247
- Oh.
- It's about time.

03:24.247 --> 03:27.076
Return it filled up,
and not just with fuel.

03:27.076 --> 03:28.425
Bring them home, Emily.

03:28.425 --> 03:31.211
We will.
Wheels up.

04:09.814 --> 04:13.949
Luke! Come on.
Luke. Luke.

04:13.949 --> 04:16.778
Wake up.

04:16.778 --> 04:17.779
Agent down!

04:17.779 --> 04:19.389
We need help!

04:23.654 --> 04:25.874

Hey, babe.

04:38.321 --> 04:40.802
Uh, I know you're asleep.

04:40.802 --> 04:43.195
Turns out this job is
a little more complicated

04:43.195 --> 04:44.806
than anyone anticipated.

04:44.806 --> 04:48.897
So I'm gonna have to stay
out here a couple more days.

04:48.897 --> 04:50.638
Sorry.

04:50.638 --> 04:52.596
But...

04:52.596 --> 04:55.730
Cameron says there's a big
Christmas bonus in it for me,

04:55.730 --> 04:59.603
so there's that.

04:59.603 --> 05:03.259
Anyway, I love you.

05:03.259 --> 05:06.175
I miss you.

05:06.175 --> 05:07.872
Give my love to the girls.

05:59.184 --> 06:02.144
Help me!

06:02.144 --> 06:03.580
Let me out!

06:13.242 --> 06:15.070
Help!

06:29.432 --> 06:31.478
We need to come
to an understanding.

06:39.137 --> 06:44.099
Now, I know how your parents
looked at me,

06:44.099 --> 06:48.669
but I'm smart.

06:48.669 --> 06:51.976
I read.

06:51.976 --> 06:55.850
In fact, just the other day,

06:55.850 --> 07:00.071
I read about these experiments
on dogs

07:00.071 --> 07:03.031
where they would
shock them in their pens.

07:03.031 --> 07:05.686
Ooh, the dogs hated it.

07:05.686 --> 07:07.252
They'd jump.

07:07.252 --> 07:10.212
They'd howl.

07:10.212 --> 07:15.217
But then,
they just gave up.

07:15.217 --> 07:19.090
That's called
learned helplessness.

07:19.090 --> 07:22.529
Your mommy and daddy
are dead.

07:22.529 --> 07:25.314
And you heard the judge.

07:25.314 --> 07:27.882
You're either state raised,

07:27.882 --> 07:31.320
or as your only
living relative,

07:31.320 --> 07:32.930
I'd get you.

07:35.106 --> 07:37.848
And around here,

07:37.848 --> 07:40.764
I got rules.

07:40.764 --> 07:44.159
So, you gonna be
a good boy?

07:47.597 --> 07:49.207
Alright.

07:50.687 --> 07:52.297
Eat up.

08:19.368 --> 08:20.804
Oh, thank God.

08:20.804 --> 08:22.980
How you doing, kids?

08:22.980 --> 08:24.808
We're ready to catch
this son of a bitch.

08:24.808 --> 08:27.115
The locals said the accelerant
was gasoline.

08:27.115 --> 08:28.595
I mean, this guy
really wanted a show.

08:28.595 --> 08:30.031
You guys are lucky
to be alive.

08:30.031 --> 08:31.119
Luck had nothing
to do with it.

08:31.119 --> 08:33.077
He called twice.

08:33.077 --> 08:35.210
He was warning us
to get out of there.

08:35.210 --> 08:39.040
So killing federal agents
is too bold, even for him.

08:39.040 --> 08:42.217
He doesn't wanna wage
a full-on war against us.

08:42.217 --> 08:45.568
Listen, if Sicarius let JJ
and Alvez rush out,

08:45.568 --> 08:47.004
then he timed it perfectly.

08:47.004 --> 08:49.529
And, look, that means he's--
- Close by.

08:49.529 --> 08:51.966
We need to fan out, cover
as much ground as possible.

08:53.881 --> 08:56.057
The suspect may still be
in the area.

09:27.436 --> 09:29.438
Sicarius staged this.

09:29.438 --> 09:31.048
Benjamin Reeves
wasn't suicidal,

09:31.048 --> 09:33.355
and he definitely wasn't
smart enough to pull this off.

09:33.355 --> 09:35.966
But he was
a perfect patsy.

09:35.966 --> 09:37.925
You think Sicarius
will go back underground?

09:37.925 --> 09:39.970
He's gonna tie off loose ends
like this one,

09:39.970 --> 09:42.843
and then
he's gonna lie low.

09:42.843 --> 09:44.758
Dave,
what are you thinking?

09:44.758 --> 09:47.325
This is where he kept
his buried treasure.

09:47.325 --> 09:49.240
But he destroyed it
like that.

09:49.240 --> 09:51.373
Like it was nothing.

09:51.373 --> 09:54.855
Souvenirs, trophies--
he blew them all up

09:54.855 --> 09:57.684
because he knew
it would get him caught.

09:57.684 --> 10:00.121
The discipline
to do that--

10:00.121 --> 10:04.473
somebody or something
made this guy very good.

10:04.473 --> 10:08.390
We figure that out,
we catch him.

10:08.390 --> 10:12.220
<i>♪ Oh, he'll recommend you
to the spirit in the sky♪</i>

10:12.220 --> 10:16.050

10:34.068 --> 10:35.547
Hey, turn that off.

10:42.511 --> 10:44.339
No.

10:44.339 --> 10:47.559
What'd you see
on our way out here?

10:47.559 --> 10:48.996
Nothing.

10:48.996 --> 10:50.824
Exactly.

10:50.824 --> 10:53.740
No road signs,
no mile markers.

10:55.742 --> 10:58.832
That's why
I picked this place.

10:58.832 --> 11:03.663
I know
precisely where we are.

11:03.663 --> 11:06.535
I know how long it takes
to get here.

11:06.535 --> 11:09.581
I know how many cars we passed
headed in the same direction,

11:09.581 --> 11:12.759
and I know when those cars
stop being as frequent.

11:12.759 --> 11:14.021
Get your ass up.

11:25.380 --> 11:26.947
Grab me one
of them buckets.

11:32.735 --> 11:34.171
What's that?

11:34.171 --> 11:36.043
Lye.

11:36.043 --> 11:40.787
It's used for soaps and candles,
but it's got other uses.

11:42.440 --> 11:45.966
Who was he?

11:45.966 --> 11:48.490
I don't know.

11:48.490 --> 11:50.144
But I know his type.

11:51.841 --> 11:54.409
<i>♪ When I die

11:54.409 --> 11:58.500
<i>♪ I'm gonna go to the place

<i>♪ Go to the place

12:23.220 --> 12:24.439
Prentiss.

12:24.439 --> 12:26.093
We have a situation
back here.

12:26.093 --> 12:27.790
I am too busy
for politics.

12:27.790 --> 12:30.619
Emily, Benjamin Reeves
murdered a sitting US Senator,

12:30.619 --> 12:32.055
do you understand?

12:32.055 --> 12:33.840
<i>The DOJ needs Reeves
to be Sicarius</i>

12:33.840 --> 12:36.451
because if he isn't
and this case is still open,

12:36.451 --> 12:38.453
and the Bureau allowed
a major political assassination

12:38.453 --> 12:40.020
to occur on our watch--

12:40.020 --> 12:41.978
<i>What are you trying to say?</i>

12:41.978 --> 12:44.328
I-I'm not gonna shut down
this investigation.

12:44.328 --> 12:46.243
The Attorney General
is going to shut you down.

12:46.243 --> 12:48.680
She can't.
Sicarius is still at large.

12:48.680 --> 12:50.595
Can you prove that?

12:50.595 --> 12:53.250
Look, if you can give me
something, anything,

12:53.250 --> 12:56.297
<i>to prove that Reeves
is not Sicarius,</i>

12:56.297 --> 12:59.561
then you and I will make the
case to the Attorney General.

13:01.693 --> 13:02.912
We'll find something.

13:02.912 --> 13:05.828
I don't know how,
but we will find it.

13:42.343 --> 13:43.474
I'm so sorry.

13:47.174 --> 13:48.828
I-I'm so sorry.

13:56.226 --> 13:58.881
Still smells new.

13:58.881 --> 14:00.665
Nice job
getting our wings back.

14:00.665 --> 14:02.580
Did you have to, uh,
arm wrestle Bailey?

14:02.580 --> 14:04.321
Believe it or not,
Bailey is not the problem--

14:04.321 --> 14:05.975
politics are.

14:05.975 --> 14:08.760
And we now have one shot
to keep the Sicarius case open.

14:08.760 --> 14:10.153
So what have we got?

14:10.153 --> 14:12.895
Okay,
a half-dozen stalker photos

14:12.895 --> 14:15.724
survived the explosion
inside a Haeberlein case.

14:15.724 --> 14:17.944
But one photo in particular
stands out.

14:17.944 --> 14:20.381
Her name is
Maria Jones.

14:20.381 --> 14:23.079
Now, her DNA was not recovered
inside the shipping container.

14:23.079 --> 14:25.690
Penelope had to identify her
using facial recognition

14:25.690 --> 14:28.737
because her body was found
over 20 years ago

14:28.737 --> 14:30.478
outside Raleigh,
North Carolina.

14:30.478 --> 14:32.915
Okay, her boyfriend,
Silvio Herrera,

14:32.915 --> 14:34.438
was convicted
of killing her.

14:34.438 --> 14:36.788
Yeah,
he confessed to doing it.

14:36.788 --> 14:38.616
He's now sitting
on death row.

14:38.616 --> 14:41.532
Then, I mean, why would Maria's
photo be in Sicarius' container?

14:41.532 --> 14:43.578
That can't be
a coincidence.

14:43.578 --> 14:45.797
I mean, look at
this bank clock here.

14:45.797 --> 14:48.409
It says 1:43, right?

14:48.409 --> 14:51.847
But prosecutors claim that Maria
was abducted before midnight.

14:51.847 --> 14:54.458
Maybe Maria was
an early victim,

14:54.458 --> 14:56.939
before Sicarius refined
his methodology.

14:56.939 --> 14:59.420
Before he committed to
"no body, no crime."

14:59.420 --> 15:02.379
Before he buried
the shipping containers.

15:02.379 --> 15:03.990
Okay, so if that's true,
then somehow,

15:03.990 --> 15:06.340
he persuaded Silvio
to confess.

15:06.340 --> 15:09.256
The guy's a master manipulator,
but, I mean,

15:09.256 --> 15:12.433
that would be one hell of a hold
on Herrera's psyche.

15:12.433 --> 15:15.262
Especially considering that
his death row sentence

15:15.262 --> 15:17.525
- wasn't guaranteed.
- Not anymore.

15:17.525 --> 15:20.441
North Carolina just ended
their pandemic moratorium.

15:20.441 --> 15:24.445
Silvio Herrera is scheduled
to be executed in 48 hours.

15:24.445 --> 15:25.968
I can assert
the BAU's prerogative

15:25.968 --> 15:27.839
to interview
death row inmates,

15:27.839 --> 15:29.145
have him transferred
to Quantico.

15:29.145 --> 15:31.104
Luke, Tara,
you'll take point.

15:31.104 --> 15:32.714
Got it.

15:41.244 --> 15:45.205
Hey.
Uh, there is a signature

15:45.205 --> 15:48.817
in the prosecutor's
filing-- R. Wilson.

15:48.817 --> 15:51.211
Yeah.

15:51.211 --> 15:53.865
I saw that, too.

15:53.865 --> 15:56.216
It's not Rebecca,
is it?

15:56.216 --> 15:58.958
That is the case
that launched her career.

16:01.917 --> 16:03.963
I'll join Luke
in the interview.

16:03.963 --> 16:06.487
No, no. It's fine.
I-I can do it.

16:06.487 --> 16:09.011
I know, but I don't think
you should.

16:09.011 --> 16:10.970
You'll observe.
I'll be in the room.

16:30.250 --> 16:31.860
Am I being released?

16:31.860 --> 16:33.905
It's amazing what cooperating
will get you.

16:33.905 --> 16:37.039
And no charges
are gonna be filed.

16:37.039 --> 16:38.171
You're free to go.

16:38.171 --> 16:39.824
What about Sicarius?

16:42.175 --> 16:43.480
I don't know.

16:43.480 --> 16:45.091
Uh, we hit a wall,
and I'm not sure

16:45.091 --> 16:48.268
if we're gonna climb over it
or smash through it.

16:48.268 --> 16:51.967
Huh.

16:51.967 --> 16:53.360
What does "huh" mean?

16:53.360 --> 16:54.491
Does "huh" mean you're going
to go home and rest?

16:54.491 --> 16:56.232
'Cause that is
a good move.

16:56.232 --> 16:58.495
You're being eerily silent
right now, Tyler,

16:58.495 --> 16:59.714
and I don't like it.

16:59.714 --> 17:01.585
Actually,
you shouldn't be alone.

17:01.585 --> 17:03.109
You just found out
about your sister

17:03.109 --> 17:05.067
and I'm concerned you
might not make the best choices.

17:05.067 --> 17:06.982
Thank you, Penelope.

17:06.982 --> 17:08.592
For everything.

17:08.592 --> 17:11.595
Y--

17:11.595 --> 17:12.988
You're welcome.

17:18.863 --> 17:22.084
Oh. Oh.
Those faces!

17:22.084 --> 17:23.607
My heart!

17:23.607 --> 17:26.523
Thank you, universe,
for bringing them back.

17:26.523 --> 17:27.959
Even Luke.

17:27.959 --> 17:29.091
Ooh.

17:29.091 --> 17:30.745
Ooh, I love this.

17:37.099 --> 17:38.796
Silvio,
I'm Emily Prentiss.

17:38.796 --> 17:40.537
This is Luke Alvez.

17:40.537 --> 17:42.887
<i>We work for the FBI's
Behavioral Analysis Unit,</i>

17:42.887 --> 17:45.499
and we'd like to ask you
some questions if we may.

17:49.111 --> 17:51.200
Do you recognize this photo?

17:56.510 --> 17:59.078
No.

18:00.253 --> 18:03.125
Do you recognize the person
in the photo?

18:03.125 --> 18:04.648
You're kidding, right?

18:04.648 --> 18:06.128
It's Maria.

18:06.128 --> 18:08.826
<i>Do you notice anything
about the photo?</i>

18:08.826 --> 18:10.480
Should I?

18:10.480 --> 18:12.265
It was taken
the night she died

18:12.265 --> 18:14.919
after the police said
that you abducted her.

18:14.919 --> 18:17.792
We found it among the
possessions of a serial killer

18:17.792 --> 18:20.142
that's been operating
for a long time.

18:20.142 --> 18:21.926
This is why you hauled
my ass up here?

18:21.926 --> 18:23.363
Yes, it is.

18:23.363 --> 18:25.365
We're just trying to
clear some things up.

18:25.365 --> 18:29.543
See, if this bank clock
is correct,

18:29.543 --> 18:34.287
then how could Maria
have been at this house

18:34.287 --> 18:36.941
in Falls Lake
where you killed her?

18:42.773 --> 18:44.645
What do you
want from me?

18:44.645 --> 18:46.603
Hmm?

18:46.603 --> 18:49.171
I confessed.

18:49.171 --> 18:52.043
I took that bitch
to my uncle's cabin,

18:52.043 --> 18:54.481
<i>and I killed her.</i>

18:54.481 --> 18:55.525
This cabin?

18:55.525 --> 18:57.571
Yeah, that cabin.

19:00.051 --> 19:04.795
Silvio, this is
an abandoned house in Ireland.

19:04.795 --> 19:08.190
The police never found where
Maria was tortured and killed.

19:08.190 --> 19:10.149
They only found her body.

19:12.368 --> 19:14.022
You trying to
fuck with me?

19:14.022 --> 19:17.025
We're trying to get
to the truth.

19:17.025 --> 19:19.201
This is some bullshit.

19:19.201 --> 19:21.334
<i>I shouldn't even
be here.</i>

19:21.334 --> 19:23.858
I should've had a needle
jabbed in my arm years ago.

19:23.858 --> 19:26.817
If you are in partnership
or protecting someone,

19:26.817 --> 19:28.819
we need to know, okay?

19:28.819 --> 19:30.560
We might be able to help
you get your sentence--

19:30.560 --> 19:33.694
Fuck you!

19:33.694 --> 19:35.522
Shh, shh, shh.

19:35.522 --> 19:37.001
Silvio! Hey!

19:37.001 --> 19:40.483
Settle down.

19:40.483 --> 19:44.748
Just tell us, please.

19:44.748 --> 19:46.359
What's done is done.

19:49.536 --> 19:51.190
I just wanna die, okay?

19:55.237 --> 19:57.196
Just let me die.

20:09.512 --> 20:12.733
Hey.

20:12.733 --> 20:15.083
I'm so sorry.

20:15.083 --> 20:18.304
I, uh, I broke our promise
to call you before.

20:18.304 --> 20:21.263
<i>You didn't break it,
I just missed it.</i>

20:21.263 --> 20:24.571
<i>I fell asleep in Michael's room
putting him to bed.</i>

20:24.571 --> 20:28.488
<i>I promise that'll never
happen again.</i>

20:28.488 --> 20:31.099
So, um, thing-- things are
pretty hectic around here,

20:31.099 --> 20:35.712
but I do think I need to take a
couple days off after this case.

20:35.712 --> 20:38.585
There's just been way too many
close calls, and I just--

20:38.585 --> 20:40.630
I need to be around you
and the boys.

20:40.630 --> 20:44.504
<i>You do what you think is best,
okay?</i>

20:44.504 --> 20:46.636
<i>We got your back, JJ.</i>

20:46.636 --> 20:48.464
<i>Always.</i>

20:48.464 --> 20:50.336
I know.

20:50.336 --> 20:53.643
One of the many reasons
why I love you.

20:53.643 --> 20:55.297
<i>I love you, too.</i>

20:57.299 --> 20:59.214
Talk soon.

20:59.214 --> 21:00.302
<i>Bye now.</i>

21:00.302 --> 21:01.956
Bye.

21:09.529 --> 21:11.879
So, we've been
slowly but surely

21:11.879 --> 21:15.578
identifying the victims
in the second container.

21:15.578 --> 21:19.713
Louise Murphy of Brentwood,
Tennessee, missing since 2014.

21:19.713 --> 21:23.499
The lab said she had crab
spiders poured down her throat.

21:23.499 --> 21:26.981
In the first container,
this victim had Sicarius spiders

21:26.981 --> 21:28.330
poured down his throat.

21:28.330 --> 21:30.419
The coroner said it took
a day for him to die.

21:30.419 --> 21:31.812
So what are you thinking?

21:31.812 --> 21:35.381
Well, crab spiders means
that Louise Murphy

21:35.381 --> 21:38.340
suffered for days
before she died.

21:38.340 --> 21:39.950
In the second container,

21:39.950 --> 21:42.997
he's deliberately
prolonging their pain.

21:42.997 --> 21:44.738
It sounds like
the first container

21:44.738 --> 21:46.827
is a rough draft
for the second.

21:46.827 --> 21:50.657
And what's to say he stopped
at only two shipping containers?

21:50.657 --> 21:53.660
He could have containers buried
all across the country.

21:53.660 --> 21:56.358
Oh.

21:56.358 --> 21:57.446
Hello?

21:57.446 --> 22:00.580
Yes, this is Penelope.

22:00.580 --> 22:02.364
Yes, okay.

22:02.364 --> 22:05.454
I have to go bail--

22:05.454 --> 22:07.413
I have to take care
of a situation.

22:11.199 --> 22:12.505
Okay.

22:12.505 --> 22:14.202
Seriously, you didn't
need to do this--

22:14.202 --> 22:15.377
Wow, your place
is pretty.

22:15.377 --> 22:17.118
Oh.

22:19.903 --> 22:21.252
Thank you. Slam.

22:21.252 --> 22:23.516
She-- She is pretty.

22:23.516 --> 22:25.387
Oh, I like
all the colors.

22:25.387 --> 22:26.388
Uh-huh.

22:26.388 --> 22:30.653
Let's get you stationary.

22:30.653 --> 22:35.571
I need a three-second warning
if you're gonna hurl, okay?

22:35.571 --> 22:37.704
I really like this rug.

22:40.271 --> 22:41.838
You should see
the other guy.

22:41.838 --> 22:46.408
Oh, I did, and you're very lucky
he didn't press charges.

22:46.408 --> 22:50.064
And very fortunate
I was able to bail...

22:50.064 --> 22:53.415
you out.

22:53.415 --> 22:55.069
Ow.

22:58.115 --> 23:00.553
That's not on me,
by the way.

23:00.553 --> 23:04.252
'Cause you know
what I was doing?

23:04.252 --> 23:07.255
I was drinking a beer.

23:07.255 --> 23:09.257
A beer?

23:09.257 --> 23:10.432
Okay,
I had a couple.

23:10.432 --> 23:12.434
Mm-hmm.

23:12.434 --> 23:14.436
Doesn't change the fact
that he waltzed on up to me

23:14.436 --> 23:16.177
and called me a terrorist.

23:16.177 --> 23:17.657
He did?
Mm.

23:17.657 --> 23:19.398
Saw my picture
on the news.

23:21.878 --> 23:24.446
I bet you're gonna say
"I told you so."

23:24.446 --> 23:26.579
Why,
because I'm 10 years old?

23:26.579 --> 23:31.584
Well, like, you did...

23:31.584 --> 23:33.455
tell me so.

23:33.455 --> 23:34.978
You said
I shouldn't be alone.

23:34.978 --> 23:39.113
Well, I-I said that because
if I was in your shoes,

23:39.113 --> 23:42.377
I might get accidentally
very sloshed, too.

23:42.377 --> 23:45.424
Um, hey, look, if you--
if you want,

23:45.424 --> 23:47.513
I can work from home
for the rest of the day

23:47.513 --> 23:50.516
and then we can get you,
"A," sober,

23:50.516 --> 23:53.519
and "B," out of trouble.

23:56.217 --> 23:57.479
Three seconds, right?

23:57.479 --> 23:59.002
Aim for the bucket.

23:59.002 --> 24:00.221
The bucket, man!

24:32.645 --> 24:34.255
Lee?

24:36.518 --> 24:39.434
Your dad calls you Lee, right?

24:42.002 --> 24:43.612
He's my uncle.

24:47.181 --> 24:49.575
Sorry.

24:49.575 --> 24:52.012
Okay.

24:52.012 --> 24:53.622
Your uncle.

24:58.540 --> 25:00.890
Please.

25:00.890 --> 25:03.240
Lee?

25:03.240 --> 25:05.982
Let me go.

25:05.982 --> 25:08.811
I promise I won't tell anybody
what happened.

25:12.511 --> 25:15.470
W-What's your name?

25:15.470 --> 25:17.037
Maria.

25:20.910 --> 25:22.564
He's going to kill me.

25:28.048 --> 25:29.832
I don't want him
to be mad at me.

25:29.832 --> 25:33.096
God, Lee, please.

25:35.229 --> 25:37.405
He hurt me so bad.

25:39.625 --> 25:45.587
But I won't tell anybody,
I swear.

25:45.587 --> 25:47.850
Please.

25:47.850 --> 25:50.287
I don't want to die.

25:54.901 --> 25:56.119
Okay.

25:56.119 --> 25:58.252
You have to be so quiet, okay?

25:58.252 --> 25:59.819
Yes.

25:59.819 --> 26:01.429
Shh, shh.

26:09.132 --> 26:10.525
Ah!

26:20.448 --> 26:21.754
No!

26:36.290 --> 26:38.640
Thank you.

26:43.166 --> 26:45.212
I should have
let her kill you.

27:13.632 --> 27:15.982
Silvio Herrera was
a member of the Mala Noche gang,

27:15.982 --> 27:19.333
but his record was for dealing,
not for murder.

27:19.333 --> 27:21.988
Yeah, but there's
his confession.

27:21.988 --> 27:24.077
You heard him.
He-- He didn't just admit it.

27:24.077 --> 27:25.992
He asked us to put a needle
in his arm.

27:25.992 --> 27:28.168
Sicarius has a pattern
with his followers.

27:28.168 --> 27:30.213
One of them gets caught,
they kill themselves.

27:30.213 --> 27:33.434
What if Silvio was
a trial run for that?

27:33.434 --> 27:37.786
So instead of getting Silvio
to commit suicide,

27:37.786 --> 27:40.180
he gets him to agree
to take the rap?

27:40.180 --> 27:44.140
I mean, maybe, but this guy
was on death row for 20 years.

27:44.140 --> 27:46.621
That's plenty of time
to change your mind.

27:46.621 --> 27:48.144
Why didn't
Silvio Herrera?

27:48.144 --> 27:50.016
Maybe Sicarius had
something on him.

27:50.016 --> 27:52.322
Something we don't know.

27:52.322 --> 27:55.064
Because he couldn't send him
threatening letters in prison.

27:55.064 --> 27:58.024
Everything Silvio got
was screened.

27:58.024 --> 28:01.897
Maybe the threat
is more symbolic.

28:01.897 --> 28:03.638
Well, then it would have
to be something

28:03.638 --> 28:06.859
only Silvio would understand
without being too obvious.

28:06.859 --> 28:09.905
I'm gonna get his belongings
sent over here.

28:09.905 --> 28:11.515
When were you
going to tell me?

28:14.214 --> 28:16.956
Um, I'll be right back.

28:24.180 --> 28:25.965
Listen, I promise
I was gonna call you

28:25.965 --> 28:27.749
as soon as
we had something.

28:27.749 --> 28:29.359
You could have given me
the heads up,

28:29.359 --> 28:31.797
just like I gave you
and your team.

28:31.797 --> 28:33.973
You didn't have to do this
behind my back.

28:33.973 --> 28:36.410
- Don't you trust me?
- Of course I trust you,

28:36.410 --> 28:38.064
but we weren't sure
what we were dealing with.

28:38.064 --> 28:40.240
But you knew
the players.

28:40.240 --> 28:42.764
Prosecuting Silvio Herrera
launched my career.

28:42.764 --> 28:45.375
It got me elected DA
and recruited by the DOJ,

28:45.375 --> 28:47.073
for Christ's sakes.

28:47.073 --> 28:50.119
I'm one step away from being
an Associate Attorney General.

28:50.119 --> 28:52.426
Yes, and that is why I did not
want to risk upsetting you

28:52.426 --> 28:53.775
with a theory.

28:53.775 --> 28:56.212
What kind of theory?

28:56.212 --> 28:58.606
There's something off
about this case.

28:58.606 --> 29:01.087
He got details wrong--
basic details.

29:01.087 --> 29:04.220
Did he
or did he not confess?

29:04.220 --> 29:06.788
Yes, likely because Sicarius
has something on him.

29:06.788 --> 29:08.834
Benjamin Reeves is dead,
so what does it matter--

29:08.834 --> 29:11.793
Benjamin Reeves
is not Sicarius.

29:15.797 --> 29:17.799
So your theory

29:17.799 --> 29:22.673
is really more like
a conspiracy theory?

29:22.673 --> 29:26.939
And you're using that
to undermine my entire career?

29:26.939 --> 29:28.462
I am not trying
to hurt you.

29:28.462 --> 29:30.116
If this guy is connected
to Sicarius

29:30.116 --> 29:32.596
and he is put to death,
we lose everything.

29:32.596 --> 29:35.208
Right now, you're going
to lose me.

29:38.037 --> 29:39.647
Don't say that.

29:42.824 --> 29:46.088
I know
Silvio Herrera is guilty,

29:46.088 --> 29:48.743
and I know
how I feel about you,

29:48.743 --> 29:52.529
but if you go all the way
with this, it's over.

30:09.068 --> 30:10.591
<i>There are
too many victims.</i>

30:10.591 --> 30:12.245
<i>I can't keep track of
all this horribleness.</i>

30:12.245 --> 30:16.336
Yeah, I know, but we are
starting to find a pattern--

30:16.336 --> 30:17.903
victimologies.

30:17.903 --> 30:20.688
The first container was filled
with victims

30:20.688 --> 30:22.733
living very high-risk
lifestyles--

30:22.733 --> 30:23.952
people that wouldn't
be missed.

30:23.952 --> 30:26.520
But in container
number two,

30:26.520 --> 30:29.740
that was filled with victims
in the low-risk category.

30:29.740 --> 30:32.178
<i>Right, folks that were well
connected to their community</i>

30:32.178 --> 30:33.875
<i>and their jobs
and their families.</i>

30:33.875 --> 30:36.051
<i>And they were all
reported missing.</i>

30:36.051 --> 30:38.706
I see your low risk
and raise you a parent.

30:38.706 --> 30:42.536
So far, every single victim
we've identified

30:42.536 --> 30:46.018
in the second container
had children.

30:46.018 --> 30:49.021
Okay, yeah.
Including Tyler Green's sister.

30:49.021 --> 30:50.370
<i>And--
And what about Maria Jones?</i>

30:50.370 --> 30:52.024
<i>Her photo was in there, too.</i>

30:52.024 --> 30:54.548
Uh, I-I could
have Tara ask.

30:54.548 --> 30:56.855
It's kind of a bad time
right now.

30:56.855 --> 30:58.291
<i>What?
What's happening?</i>

30:58.291 --> 30:59.901
<i>Is there gossip?
Am I missing gossip?</i>

30:59.901 --> 31:02.034
Uh, you know what,
I'll fill you in later, okay?

31:02.034 --> 31:03.687
Bye.

31:07.866 --> 31:11.913
Hey. Those the personal effects
from Silvio Herrera's cell?

31:11.913 --> 31:14.524
You don't want
to talk about it?

31:14.524 --> 31:17.571
Uh, look, I-I appreciate you
looking out for me.

31:17.571 --> 31:19.225
I really do.

31:19.225 --> 31:22.445
But everything I say
or don't say

31:22.445 --> 31:23.751
is blowing up in my face.

31:23.751 --> 31:25.971
So can we just solve
what's at hand

31:25.971 --> 31:29.235
and talk about my crumbling
love life over a beer?

31:29.235 --> 31:30.323
Yeah.

31:30.323 --> 31:31.977
Deal.

31:37.460 --> 31:39.810
Wait a minute.
Look at these.

31:39.810 --> 31:43.292
Every one of these letters
has a postmark

31:43.292 --> 31:45.729
from up and down
the Eastern Seaboard.

31:45.729 --> 31:51.561
All of them have a picture
of this guy.

31:51.561 --> 31:53.215
That matches
the voyeuristic style

31:53.215 --> 31:55.087
from the shipping containers.

31:55.087 --> 31:56.871
I mean,
as far as I can tell,

31:56.871 --> 31:58.264
there's a letter here
from every year

31:58.264 --> 32:00.570
of Herrera's incarceration.

32:00.570 --> 32:02.616
Including the year
he was arrested.

32:07.360 --> 32:09.362
"I confess to Almighty God
and to you,

32:09.362 --> 32:10.667
my brothers and sisters,

32:10.667 --> 32:12.626
that I've sinned
through my own fault,

32:12.626 --> 32:14.976
in my thoughts
and my words,

32:14.976 --> 32:17.761
in what I have done
and what I have failed to do."

32:17.761 --> 32:19.241
That's the Catholic
confessional prayer.

32:20.808 --> 32:22.288
And we profiled
that Sicarius

32:22.288 --> 32:25.378
had something on Silvio.

32:25.378 --> 32:26.988
What if it's him?

32:39.392 --> 32:41.002
What's his name?

32:43.048 --> 32:44.658
Nobody.

32:47.182 --> 32:49.924
Silvio, I'm gonna be honest
with you.

32:49.924 --> 32:51.795
When we brought you here,

32:51.795 --> 32:54.276
we thought you were
protecting a killer.

32:54.276 --> 32:56.148
<i>But you know
what I think now?</i>

32:56.148 --> 33:00.935
<i>I think you were
protecting him from one.</i>

33:02.676 --> 33:06.549
See, it's the prayer
that gives it away.

33:08.943 --> 33:13.034
He's threatening you
over what you did.

33:13.034 --> 33:15.863
Or what you failed to do.

33:24.872 --> 33:27.483
Hey.
Could I have a minute?

33:41.236 --> 33:43.891
Silvio, I'm Tara.

33:43.891 --> 33:46.502
I work with the BAU.

33:46.502 --> 33:48.983
Good for you.

33:48.983 --> 33:50.898
You here to trick me, too?

33:50.898 --> 33:52.073
No.

33:52.073 --> 33:55.598
No more tricks.

33:55.598 --> 33:57.731
I'm a forensic psychologist.

33:57.731 --> 34:01.213
It means
I study psychopaths.

34:01.213 --> 34:05.565
I identify the markers
that make them dangerous.

34:05.565 --> 34:09.917
Do you know what markers
I see when I look at you?

34:09.917 --> 34:11.658
None of them.

34:11.658 --> 34:14.226
Not one.

34:14.226 --> 34:15.923
I do know you, though.

34:19.927 --> 34:21.537
Do you?

34:24.714 --> 34:28.066
I do.

34:28.066 --> 34:31.112
You know,
I was married once.

34:31.112 --> 34:32.853
Didn't work out.

34:35.290 --> 34:38.250
And I thought,
"Man, relationships--

34:38.250 --> 34:41.253
they're not for me."

34:41.253 --> 34:44.473
And then,
I met this woman.

34:47.085 --> 34:51.089
And she just, um,
she lit up my life.

34:53.178 --> 34:58.270
And I was so confused at first
because I never thought

34:58.270 --> 35:02.012
that my happily ever after
was going to be with someone

35:02.012 --> 35:05.364
who is the same gender as me,
you know?

35:08.454 --> 35:11.457
Yeah, gang life?
I get it.

35:11.457 --> 35:12.675
Can't be vulnerable.

35:12.675 --> 35:13.981
Can't show weakness.

35:13.981 --> 35:16.244
Can't be yourself.

35:16.244 --> 35:18.420
The guy that is doing this
to you,

35:18.420 --> 35:20.466
he knows that.

35:20.466 --> 35:24.426
He is betting on you following
the cultural rules of machismo

35:24.426 --> 35:27.212
all the way to the end.

35:27.212 --> 35:28.822
That's not it.

35:35.481 --> 35:39.137
I mean, you're right...

35:39.137 --> 35:41.051
about him.

35:41.051 --> 35:42.662
<i>Mi novio.</i>

35:52.324 --> 35:53.716
But that's not it.

35:53.716 --> 35:56.154
Okay.

35:56.154 --> 35:57.720
Then what is it?

36:00.245 --> 36:03.204
The photos were a reminder

36:03.204 --> 36:06.816
that he could kill <i>mi novio</i>
whenever he wanted.

36:06.816 --> 36:10.080
So if I die,
then he'll finally be free.

36:12.692 --> 36:18.263
Silvio, we can protect him
and you.

36:18.263 --> 36:22.180
All you have to do
is give me a name.

36:22.180 --> 36:24.007
Nah.

36:24.007 --> 36:26.445
You can't.

36:26.445 --> 36:28.055
You don't pull a <i>pendejo</i>
from death row

36:28.055 --> 36:29.622
'cause I'm your best bet.

36:31.711 --> 36:33.278
It's over.

36:35.541 --> 36:37.151
And I'm done talking.

36:40.807 --> 36:42.156
Those photos you scanned,

36:42.156 --> 36:43.505
I put them through
facial recognition

36:43.505 --> 36:45.986
and the name of your guy
is Juan Gutierrez.

36:45.986 --> 36:48.162
Looks like Juan was
Silvio's right-hand man

36:48.162 --> 36:52.427
in Mala Noche's
local narcotics distribution.

36:52.427 --> 36:54.255
Do we know
where Juan is now?

36:54.255 --> 36:55.996
I've been running
recent addresses.

36:55.996 --> 36:57.693
It's super weird.

36:57.693 --> 36:59.782
It's like he fell off
the face of the planet in 2005.

36:59.782 --> 37:01.436
Does Juan have
any aliases?

37:01.436 --> 37:03.090
<i>I'm checking
for that now, too.</i>

37:05.135 --> 37:06.441
What was that?

37:06.441 --> 37:08.617
<i>My cat.</i>

37:08.617 --> 37:09.879
Are you safe?

37:09.879 --> 37:11.664
That sounded
like Bigfoot.

37:11.664 --> 37:13.231
Okay, I'll have you know
that the reason

37:13.231 --> 37:14.928
why I'm working from home
for the rest of the day

37:14.928 --> 37:16.190
is because I'm trying to get
the Black Queen and Sergio

37:16.190 --> 37:17.539
to learn to share space,
and that--

37:17.539 --> 37:19.237
Hey, guess what?

37:19.237 --> 37:23.197
Mr. Juan Gutierrez may have
outrun his sordid past,

37:23.197 --> 37:25.025
but he did not outrun me.

37:25.025 --> 37:27.027
His new name is Samuel Ortiz

37:27.027 --> 37:29.421
and he now resides
in Norfolk, Virginia.

37:29.421 --> 37:31.249
Alright, I-I say we get
the Norfolk division

37:31.249 --> 37:32.598
to bring him in
for questioning.

37:32.598 --> 37:34.687
Great work, Penelope. <i>My pleasure.</i>

37:34.687 --> 37:36.341
Go feed that cat.

37:41.433 --> 37:42.738
Oh.

37:42.738 --> 37:44.174
Thank you.

37:44.174 --> 37:45.437
No problem.

37:45.437 --> 37:47.090
It's the least
I can do.

37:50.790 --> 37:53.445
Thank you for looking out
for me today.

37:53.445 --> 37:55.795
Yeah. I just wish I would have
got to you sooner

37:55.795 --> 38:01.496
before they messed that
very symmetrical face up.

38:01.496 --> 38:04.282
You know what
I always thought?

38:04.282 --> 38:06.762
When I finally found proof
that he took Alison,

38:06.762 --> 38:08.982
that it'd bring me
some sense of closure.

38:08.982 --> 38:13.465
But there's still just...

38:13.465 --> 38:16.381
so much pain, you know?

38:16.381 --> 38:18.861
I can't describe it.
It's like-- It's like...

38:21.211 --> 38:23.344
There's this hole
and you think

38:23.344 --> 38:25.172
you can fill it
with the answers,

38:25.172 --> 38:29.350
and then you get the answers
and it doesn't fill the hole.

38:29.350 --> 38:33.354
It just makes the hole different.

38:36.226 --> 38:39.839
Exactly.

38:39.839 --> 38:41.971
I felt it, too.

38:41.971 --> 38:44.017
My parents were killed
by a drunk driver.

38:44.017 --> 38:47.237
I'm so sorry.

38:47.237 --> 38:48.848
Oh.

38:56.029 --> 38:57.857
Uh, oh.

38:57.857 --> 38:59.772
Uh, we should go on a walk.

38:59.772 --> 39:01.730
A walk?

39:01.730 --> 39:03.210
Yes, we should,

39:03.210 --> 39:05.865
'cause walks are outside
and they're very sobering

39:05.865 --> 39:07.693
and they're in the air
and there's people.

39:07.693 --> 39:09.521
We should walk.
Th-- Th--

39:09.521 --> 39:11.392
Around here,
there are so many good...

39:26.059 --> 39:27.756
Well, shit.

39:27.756 --> 39:29.932
Elias Voit: Do you think they'll
figure out who it was?

39:29.932 --> 39:31.847
No.

39:31.847 --> 39:33.545
I'm not a dumbass.

39:33.545 --> 39:35.547
I always make sure
there's never enough evidence

39:35.547 --> 39:37.157
to lead back to me.

39:39.420 --> 39:41.379
And in this case,
I got a fall guy.

39:45.121 --> 39:46.384
Timing's a little funny, though.

39:46.384 --> 39:49.387
What do you mean?

39:49.387 --> 39:52.738
I mean, there hasn't been any
activity around these parts

39:52.738 --> 39:54.653
since before I lived here.

39:54.653 --> 39:57.090
So it's a little funny.

39:57.090 --> 39:59.919
The Durham County
Sheriff Department

39:59.919 --> 40:02.225
just so happened
to come sniffing around.

41:23.002 --> 41:25.091
Cyrus Lebrun:
The hell you think you're going?

41:30.575 --> 41:33.882
To talk to the cops
again?

41:33.882 --> 41:37.756
I didn't say anything
to anyone.

41:37.756 --> 41:39.105
How could I?

41:39.105 --> 41:42.412
You never let me go anywhere
without you.

41:42.412 --> 41:44.197
That's right.

41:44.197 --> 41:48.027
You can't go nowhere
without me.

41:48.027 --> 41:50.159
I don't need you anymore.

41:50.159 --> 41:51.639
I'm out.

41:51.639 --> 41:53.554
Over my dead body.

42:20.189 --> 42:24.193
That's the smartest thing
you've ever done, boy.

42:24.193 --> 42:27.719
You kill me now, the sheriff
will know it was you.

42:29.764 --> 42:31.418
Maybe you have
been listening.

42:35.901 --> 42:37.511
You'll be back.

42:40.601 --> 42:42.211
I'm all you got.

43:03.711 --> 43:04.973
Mr. Gutierrez,
we brought you here

43:04.973 --> 43:06.627
because new evidence
has come to light

43:06.627 --> 43:08.847
in the Silvio Herrera case.

43:08.847 --> 43:10.718
Juan, we know Silvio
was keeping a secret.

43:10.718 --> 43:12.241
You weren't just
partners in crime,

43:12.241 --> 43:14.287
you were romantic partners
as well.

43:17.725 --> 43:19.161
Yes.

43:19.161 --> 43:22.556
Silvio and I were--
We loved each other.

43:22.556 --> 43:24.776
We couldn't be out
back then.

43:24.776 --> 43:27.430
Not in Raleigh. Definitely not
in the Mala Noche.

43:29.650 --> 43:32.131
Are you sure that no one
knew about you two?

43:32.131 --> 43:34.481
We had to be good
about hiding it.

43:34.481 --> 43:36.483
But a few weeks
before Silvio was arrested,

43:36.483 --> 43:39.399
we were discovered by this man
that we bought guns from.

43:39.399 --> 43:41.140
This guy, Cyrus.

43:41.140 --> 43:42.794
We had to pay him off
to keep quiet,

43:42.794 --> 43:46.928
but I remember how obsessed
he used to be with Maria.

43:46.928 --> 43:48.060
And I always thought
he had something

43:48.060 --> 43:49.365
to do with killing her.

43:49.365 --> 43:52.804
You never
suspected Silvio?

43:52.804 --> 43:54.675
He didn't kill Maria.

43:54.675 --> 43:56.503
How can you
be so sure?

43:56.503 --> 43:58.940
Because I was with him
the night she disappeared.

43:58.940 --> 44:02.117
We went to a drag ball
in Kitts Creek.

44:02.117 --> 44:04.816
It was our first time being
together around other people.

44:04.816 --> 44:06.992
Can you prove that?

44:06.992 --> 44:09.472
I have pictures
from that night.

44:09.472 --> 44:10.996
Why didn't you hand them over
sooner?

44:10.996 --> 44:13.389
I tried, but Silvio
didn't want my help.

44:13.389 --> 44:16.175
He told me he would
deny everything.

44:16.175 --> 44:19.700
And a day later,
he confessed.

44:19.700 --> 44:23.704
Juan, if you give those pictures
to us, the FBI can--

44:23.704 --> 44:25.532
I don't need promises.

44:28.317 --> 44:30.711
I stopped living in fear
when I left Raleigh.

44:30.711 --> 44:34.323
Silvio has lost most of his life
trying to protect me.

44:34.323 --> 44:37.805
And it's about time
I return the favor.

44:37.805 --> 44:39.894
Silvio Herrera's refusing
to talk anymore.

44:39.894 --> 44:43.506
He is being transferred back
for execution at midnight.

44:43.506 --> 44:44.899
He didn't do it.

44:44.899 --> 44:46.509
We can take what we have
to the Attorney General.

44:46.509 --> 44:49.034
It's a sliver,
but it is something.

44:49.034 --> 44:50.557
But first,
it would certainly help

44:50.557 --> 44:52.515
if the original prosecutor
withdrew the case.

44:54.561 --> 44:56.824
Do you want me
to talk to her?

44:56.824 --> 44:59.522
No.
No, I'll do it.

45:10.403 --> 45:12.057
This is impossible.

45:12.057 --> 45:13.667
It's exonerating.

45:13.667 --> 45:15.538
And we have
an alternate suspect--

45:15.538 --> 45:18.541
an illegal gun dealer
who went by the name Cyrus.

45:18.541 --> 45:20.413
He sold guns
to the Mala Noche.

45:20.413 --> 45:22.589
He showed an interest
in Maria Jones.

45:22.589 --> 45:24.417
He found out the Juan
and Silvio were lovers

45:24.417 --> 45:28.029
and then
he blackmailed Silvio.

45:28.029 --> 45:31.076
Back then, there was this
Cyrus suspected of running guns,

45:31.076 --> 45:33.339
but that name never came up
in the trial.

45:33.339 --> 45:35.254
Rebecca, we are
running out of time.

45:35.254 --> 45:36.908
You are the only person
who can pick up the phone

45:36.908 --> 45:39.562
and convince the governor
to stay this execution.

45:43.566 --> 45:45.090
I want you to
tell me something.

45:47.353 --> 45:49.529
Tell me what happens
when I make that call.

45:53.925 --> 45:55.535
Honestly, I don't know.

45:59.582 --> 46:05.937
Now, tell me that Silvio Herrera
is 100% innocent.

46:08.983 --> 46:10.637
I'd bet my life on it.

46:23.650 --> 46:25.304
It's been a long time
since I've been down here.

46:25.304 --> 46:27.001
My sister
worked around here.

46:27.001 --> 46:30.265
I tell you, Alison sounds
like she was the best.

46:30.265 --> 46:32.311
Yeah, she was.

46:32.311 --> 46:33.834
Actually, we're really close
to where she used to work.

46:33.834 --> 46:36.184
It's right around
the corner.

46:36.184 --> 46:37.751
This little dive
called Delilah's.

46:37.751 --> 46:40.362
Delilah's?
Wasn't that where--

46:40.362 --> 46:42.495
It's okay. Yeah, it's where
she wanted me to meet her

46:42.495 --> 46:44.105
the night
she went missing.

46:49.284 --> 46:51.634
Everything okay?

46:51.634 --> 46:53.723
Oak Street.

46:53.723 --> 46:58.076
Oak Street wasn't
always Oak Street.

46:58.076 --> 46:59.904
I'm sorry?
Taxi!

47:03.037 --> 47:05.213
Tyler,
uh, I'm so sorry.

47:05.213 --> 47:06.519
Here--
Here are my, uh, keys.

47:06.519 --> 47:08.086
You can wait there
and I-I can--

47:08.086 --> 47:09.609
I can meet you
at my place later.

47:09.609 --> 47:11.045
I just-- I have to get
back to the office.

47:11.045 --> 47:12.960
What?
Can I help?

47:12.960 --> 47:14.614
Um, no.
No, you can't.

47:14.614 --> 47:16.007
I--

47:23.057 --> 47:25.886
Okay, I-I gotta go.

47:25.886 --> 47:27.453
Goodbye.

47:39.291 --> 47:40.683
Hey.

47:40.683 --> 47:42.250
I am so sorry I--I know I did the right--

47:44.644 --> 47:47.647
You first.

47:47.647 --> 47:49.910
I know I did
the right thing,

47:49.910 --> 47:53.392
but I got the call.

47:53.392 --> 47:55.002
I'm under review.

47:56.917 --> 47:58.310
This wasn't your fault.

47:58.310 --> 48:01.791
I-I should have been--Let me finish.

48:01.791 --> 48:04.751
I have never not been
on your side.

48:07.014 --> 48:11.236
But you couldn't be honest
with me about what you needed.

48:11.236 --> 48:12.933
And that's not fair.

48:17.198 --> 48:20.549
Um, can we talk
about this at home?

48:20.549 --> 48:23.509
No.

48:23.509 --> 48:28.253
Uh, um, why not?

48:28.253 --> 48:29.863
Because I'm not going home.

48:45.618 --> 48:50.275
Please give me
some good news.

48:50.275 --> 48:51.972
Alright.

48:51.972 --> 48:54.192
I've been building
a geo-profile.

48:54.192 --> 48:57.325
A fraction of victims
from his Yakima County container

48:57.325 --> 48:59.197
were reported missing.

48:59.197 --> 49:00.938
You go to
Whitfield County,

49:00.938 --> 49:04.463
and the victim type
shifts drastically.

49:04.463 --> 49:06.204
They're all parents.

49:06.204 --> 49:10.556
The kind of people that get
search parties and news stories.

49:10.556 --> 49:12.645
So they're a challenge
for him?

49:12.645 --> 49:14.473
That's why he leaves them
in Georgia,

49:14.473 --> 49:15.822
far away
from where he lives.

49:15.822 --> 49:17.302
He wouldn't want to
risk authorities

49:17.302 --> 49:19.652
conducting a search
anywhere near his backyard.

49:19.652 --> 49:21.610
We know
he revisits the victims,

49:21.610 --> 49:23.786
so the first container
was likely close

49:23.786 --> 49:25.310
to where he actually lives.

49:25.310 --> 49:27.094
- You got it.
- Hey! Hey!

49:27.094 --> 49:30.358
Forgive me. I know this is not
my area of expertise, but--

49:30.358 --> 49:32.491
but I was on a walk with--
Never mind that.

49:32.491 --> 49:34.493
Suffice to say, I think that
I have something

49:34.493 --> 49:35.842
that will help us
with the Sicarius profile,

49:35.842 --> 49:37.322
I just need-- Yes.
I need this.

49:37.322 --> 49:41.108
Okay. Okay, look, all of
the identified victims,

49:41.108 --> 49:44.764
no exceptions, have a connection
to the name

49:44.764 --> 49:48.028
of a single location--
Second Street.

49:49.638 --> 49:52.076
Uh, I'm not qu--
quite following.

49:52.076 --> 49:54.295
I-I-I looked at all
the victim's biographies and--

49:54.295 --> 49:55.993
and it's bananas.

49:55.993 --> 49:57.516
Every single time, whether
it was where they worked,

49:57.516 --> 49:59.605
where they hung out,
where they were last seen,

49:59.605 --> 50:02.695
each and every one
crossed a Second Street

50:02.695 --> 50:05.045
before they went missing.

50:05.045 --> 50:06.873
Alison Green
wouldn't fit that pattern.

50:06.873 --> 50:08.396
I mean, there's nothing here
that says that she--

50:08.396 --> 50:11.138
Alison Green-- Alison Green
worked at Delilah's,

50:11.138 --> 50:12.966
which still exists
and is on Oak Street,

50:12.966 --> 50:16.317
but in 2007, Oak Street was
an extension of Second Street.

50:16.317 --> 50:17.840
She's right.

50:17.840 --> 50:20.539
Basically, in whatever city
Sicarius finds himself,

50:20.539 --> 50:23.629
Second Street is
his preferred hunting ground.

50:23.629 --> 50:25.326
And maybe it's--
it's wishful thinking

50:25.326 --> 50:26.980
because Second Street
is, like,

50:26.980 --> 50:29.287
the most common name of a street
in the United States,

50:29.287 --> 50:31.202
but maybe it means
something to him.

50:31.202 --> 50:32.681
It's not a coincidence.

50:32.681 --> 50:34.118
Where he hunts is rooted

50:34.118 --> 50:37.208
in something
that's deeply personal to him.

50:37.208 --> 50:40.602
And who he hunts
is a form of transference.

50:40.602 --> 50:42.082
Transference?

50:42.082 --> 50:44.693
Meaning you think
Sicarius is a father.

50:44.693 --> 50:47.870
I do, because as a parent,
i-i-it--

50:47.870 --> 50:51.961
it might explain why there's
so many gaps between kills.

50:51.961 --> 50:54.138
The cooling off periods
might line up

50:54.138 --> 50:56.096
with his children's births.

50:56.096 --> 50:58.707
Father by day,
serial killer by night.

50:58.707 --> 51:00.361
That's why
he's so disciplined,

51:00.361 --> 51:03.147
but that's how we're gonna
catch this son of a bitch.

51:03.147 --> 51:05.105
Through his family.

51:25.169 --> 51:28.607
Well, well.

51:28.607 --> 51:32.785
The prodigal son returns.

51:32.785 --> 51:35.004
Took you long enough.

51:35.004 --> 51:36.658
Yeah, sometimes
when I close my eyes,

51:36.658 --> 51:38.356
it's like I never left.

51:38.356 --> 51:40.053
Oh.

51:40.053 --> 51:42.838
That's what you been doing
the last 20 fucking years?

51:42.838 --> 51:45.667
Yeah.
Just thinking
about this place?

51:45.667 --> 51:48.279
Even after
I went to school.

51:48.279 --> 51:50.455
After I fell in love,
got married, had two daughters,

51:50.455 --> 51:53.110
I can't get this fucking place
out of my head.

51:53.110 --> 51:54.502
Cyrus Lebrun: Huh.

51:54.502 --> 51:56.287
After everything
I taught you,

51:56.287 --> 51:59.159
you still think
you can be normal.

51:59.159 --> 52:01.161
No, I'm still
what you made me.

52:01.161 --> 52:03.163
Oh.

52:03.163 --> 52:06.123
Is that why
you came back, huh?

52:06.123 --> 52:08.168
- To blame me?
- I could've had a chance.

52:08.168 --> 52:09.343
I could've been different.

52:09.343 --> 52:12.651
No, you couldn't.

52:12.651 --> 52:16.829
Our vice
is in our blood.

52:16.829 --> 52:18.657
Need I remind you

52:18.657 --> 52:22.051
of the real reason
you came into my custody?

52:28.710 --> 52:32.192
It's you.

52:32.192 --> 52:34.412
The one they're
all talking about.

52:39.068 --> 52:40.679
Sicarius.

52:47.555 --> 52:50.819
Did you come here
to kill me?

52:50.819 --> 52:52.821
Oh, I already killed you
an hour ago.

52:52.821 --> 52:56.434
Slipped some naproxen
in your IV.

52:56.434 --> 52:59.959
I just came here
to watch an old man die.

53:02.527 --> 53:04.181
I see.

53:09.577 --> 53:11.753
You dumb son of a bitch.

53:11.753 --> 53:15.366
If I die,
they'll connect me to you.

53:15.366 --> 53:17.716
No, they won't.

53:17.716 --> 53:21.285
They'll just find a lonely old
man who died of kidney failure.

53:27.247 --> 53:28.901
I always knew it.

53:31.077 --> 53:33.166
Family's what
gets you killed.

53:41.870 --> 53:44.743
You'll find that out
soon enough.

53:50.227 --> 53:54.143
And that little
family of yours?

53:54.143 --> 53:55.710
Yeah.

53:59.758 --> 54:01.325
They'll find out, too.
