Goosebumps.

00:51.500 --> 00:53.933

Over here!

Oh, man.
You and your dumb hobbies.

01:25.533 --> 01:27.600
Wax rubbings.
Who makes wax rubbings?

01:27.600 --> 01:30.100
I do,
'cause I'm interested in things.

01:30.600 --> 01:31.600
Let's go down to the beach.

01:32.100 --> 01:34.600
We finally get to visit
Brad and Agatha,

01:35.100 --> 01:36.600
and all you wanna do
is rub gravestones all day.

01:37.100 --> 01:38.933
It's cool. See, Jerry?

01:38.933 --> 01:41.433
It's a death's head,
an old Puritan symbol.

01:41.933 --> 01:43.933
- Creepy, huh?
- Right. Let's go to the beach!

01:44.500 --> 01:46.633
Hey, check out the name.

01:46.633 --> 01:48.133
"Harrison Sadler."

01:48.633 --> 01:50.633
- Sadler?
- I know. Look.

01:50.633 --> 01:52.633
He died in 1642.

01:53.133 --> 01:56.133
One of the first guys to come to
America, and he's got our last name.

01:56.633 --> 01:59.567
- Oh.
- Check out the epitaph.

01:59.567 --> 02:04.700
"Though his bones are but dust,
his spirit lives on forever."

02:06.100 --> 02:08.100
Terri, don't you want
to go to the beach?

02:08.100 --> 02:12.100

here is so old. [ Screaming ]

- [ Girl Laughing ]
- [ Boy Laughing ] Best one ever!

02:31.367 --> 02:33.800
You've gotta be pretty demented
if you think that was funny.

02:33.800 --> 02:35.233
We've been watching you guys.

02:35.233 --> 02:38.467
We could see you this morning
heading out for the graveyard,

02:38.467 --> 02:40.800
so we thought
we'd give you a little scare.

02:40.800 --> 02:43.533
"Little scare"?
Come on, Terri. Let's go.

02:43.533 --> 02:46.900
- Hey. We're sorry.
- We are. We're really sorry.

02:47.400 --> 02:49.400
- It was just a joke.
- Pretty complicated joke.

02:49.900 --> 02:53.400
I guess it was. My name's
Sam Sadler. This is my sister Louisa.

02:53.400 --> 02:55.400
Sadler?
That's our last name.

02:55.400 --> 02:56.900
- Really?
- Yeah.

02:56.900 --> 02:58.900
I'm Terri Sadler,
and this is my brother Jerry.

02:58.900 --> 03:02.400
We're staying with Brad and Agatha,
our fourth cousins, twice remodeled.

03:02.400 --> 03:05.100
Removed, Jerry.
Twice removed.

03:05.533 --> 03:08.100
- Whatever that means.
- It means they're distant relatives.

03:08.100 --> 03:10.933
- They're Sadlers too.
- There's lots of Sadlers around here.

03:10.933 --> 03:13.200
No kidding.
Even dead ones.

03:13.200 --> 03:15.600
[ Louisa ]
Harrison Sadler is dead,

03:15.600 --> 03:19.300
but he still walks the night.

03:19.300 --> 03:21.433
They're just trying
to scare us again.

03:21.433 --> 03:23.267
Nice try.

03:24.267 --> 03:25.767
Oh, come on.

03:25.767 --> 03:28.367
You don't really believe
in ghosts, do you?

03:28.367 --> 03:31.300
If you go near the cave down
at the beach, you will too.

03:31.300 --> 03:32.967
- That's enough, Sam!
- The cave?

03:32.967 --> 03:35.867
Come on. We need to go.
We'll see you around.

03:37.233 --> 03:39.367
[ Dog Barking ]

03:39.367 --> 03:42.833
[ Man ] Agatha, give Jerry a
little more of that pot pie.

03:42.833 --> 03:46.100
[ Chuckling ]
Oh, I sure will, Brad.

03:46.100 --> 03:47.533
There.

03:47.533 --> 03:52.433
Everything tastes so much better
cooked on that old wood burner.

03:52.433 --> 03:55.200
They've brought in the power, but
we haven't bothered hooking it up.

03:55.200 --> 03:58.167
- [ Chuckling ]
- Um, I don't think I can eat all this.

03:59.133 --> 04:00.467
Really?

04:00.467 --> 04:03.967
Your parents didn't say
you were such little eaters.

04:03.967 --> 04:05.967
- Oh, but it's good.
- It's really good.

04:05.967 --> 04:08.767
Oh, it's so nice having
young folk around the place...

04:08.767 --> 04:12.033
that appreciate our way of life.

04:12.033 --> 04:14.300
So nice your folks
brought you up here...

04:14.300 --> 04:16.733
to be with your old cousins.

04:17.233 --> 04:19.933
Sure is better than spending the
summer in a sweaty apartment.

04:19.933 --> 04:22.933
And Dad told us all kinds of stories
about being here when he was a kid.

04:23.533 --> 04:25.533
And we always wanted
to meet you guys in person.

04:25.933 --> 04:28.967
Well, your dad always cared
about keeping the family together.

04:28.967 --> 04:31.767
- Always made the effort.
- We met some other Sadlers today.

04:33.433 --> 04:36.633
- Kids.
- Sam and Louisa.

04:37.567 --> 04:40.200
Mm-hmm.
They're nice kids.

04:40.600 --> 04:42.967
Are they our relatives too?

04:42.967 --> 04:47.300
- Could be.
- Very, very distant, if they are.

04:47.300 --> 04:50.033
They went on about some--
some ghost in a cave.

04:51.400 --> 04:54.167
[ Chuckles ]
Never heard of it.

04:55.533 --> 04:58.133
Well, I've got some reading to do.

[ Seagulls Squawking ]

05:11.567 --> 05:15.567
[ Squawking Continues ]

05:27.733 --> 05:30.567
Some kinds of seaweed you can
actually eat. It's full of iodine.

05:30.567 --> 05:33.533
It's full of bugs. Let's go
see if we can find that cave.

05:33.533 --> 05:35.533
- There are no bugs in it.
- Ew.

05:35.533 --> 05:38.433
I wish I had a book on all
the different types of seaweed.

05:38.433 --> 05:42.067
Fine.
I'll look for the cave myself then.

05:44.967 --> 05:46.800

05:47.533 --> 05:50.467
- [ Screams ]
- What is it?

05:50.967 --> 05:52.967
What's wrong?

05:52.967 --> 05:55.367
- Weird.
- Look at that.

05:55.367 --> 05:57.767
- A perfect skeleton.
- Of what?

05:57.767 --> 05:59.433
A raccoon maybe?

05:59.433 --> 06:01.767
Too small for a raccoon.

06:01.767 --> 06:04.600
- Do you guys always creep up on everyone?
- Sorry.

06:04.600 --> 06:06.467
Well, if it's not a raccoon,
then what is it?

06:06.967 --> 06:09.633
- [ Sam ] Just a dog.
- A dog? What happened to it?

06:09.633 --> 06:10.967
- It got eaten.
- Sam!

06:13.433 --> 06:15.267
Oh, come on.

06:15.267 --> 06:17.733
I mean, the bones are picked clean.

06:17.733 --> 06:20.400
What kind of animal would
do something like this?

06:23.700 --> 06:27.767
I guess if you're going to
be around here, you should know.

06:27.767 --> 06:30.600
It wasn't an animal that
picked those bones clean.

06:31.100 --> 06:32.633
It was the ghost.

06:32.633 --> 06:36.033
- The ghost of Harrison Sadler.
- Oh, come on!

06:36.033 --> 06:39.633
It killed and ate it because dogs
can tell if someone's a ghost.

06:39.633 --> 06:42.133
Dogs always bark
to warn about ghosts.

06:42.133 --> 06:45.967
- Oh, give me a break.
- Let's go.

06:45.967 --> 06:48.400
Oh, wait a second.

06:48.400 --> 06:50.300
Have you ever seen it?

06:51.967 --> 06:54.433
Do you see that opening
in those rocks?

06:54.933 --> 06:56.933
The ghost lives up there.

06:57.433 --> 07:00.933
Some people say
for over 300 years.

07:01.433 --> 07:03.433
- [ Terri ] Have you ever seen it?
- [ Louisa ] No one has.

07:03.933 --> 07:05.933
[ Jerry ] If you've never seen him,
how do you know he's up there?

07:06.433 --> 07:07.933
We've seen the skeletons.

07:07.933 --> 07:10.767
And the flickering light
in the mouth of the cave.

07:10.767 --> 07:13.567
It's probably just some
guy with a flashlight.

07:15.733 --> 07:17.133
-[ Gasps ]
- [ Terri ] What?

07:17.133 --> 07:19.500
- You saw the light, didn't you?
- I'm not sure.

This is just another one
of your dumb jokes, isn't it?

07:22.933 --> 07:26.933
Think what you want. Come on, Louisa.
I told you they were nonbelievers.

07:37.067 --> 07:39.567

Some nice beef stew.

07:39.567 --> 07:43.067

Um, I can eat more than that, Agatha.

07:43.067 --> 07:45.567
I just don't know
how to feed you kids.

First of all,
you're not hungry, now you are.

07:50.600 --> 07:53.267
[ Brad ]
So what did you kids do today?

07:53.267 --> 07:55.467
We saw those Sadler kids again.

07:55.900 --> 07:58.433
They said something about a
ghost who lives in this cave.

07:58.433 --> 08:00.500
They said he kills and eats dogs...

08:00.500 --> 08:03.100
and makes this light go off and on.

08:03.100 --> 08:05.200
[ Chuckles ] Yeah.
Jerry thinks he saw a ghost.

08:05.633 --> 08:07.933
I did not.
I didn't see a ghost.

08:09.300 --> 08:11.233
Just a light.

08:11.233 --> 08:14.833
Ah, you ever hear
of aurora borealis, Jerry?

08:14.833 --> 08:17.600
- Yeah.
- It happens certain times of the year.

08:17.600 --> 08:19.200
Something electric gets in the air,

08:19.700 --> 08:22.633
and the whole sky
lights up in streamers.

08:25.367 --> 08:27.033
Oh, it was the middle
of the day, and--

08:27.033 --> 08:30.333
Just stay clear of beach's caves,
you hear me?

08:30.800 --> 08:33.700

- Listen. You want to check out that cave?

It's the middle of the night.

09:12.100 --> 09:15.000
I know, but I can't sleep.

Where's your sense of adventure?

09:20.467 --> 09:24.533

09:27.567 --> 09:30.200
- Do you hear that?
- Yeah.

09:30.200 --> 09:34.567
- You think the ghost got it?
- I don't believe in ghosts.

09:34.567 --> 09:38.567
Well, neither do I, but you
know something's going on.

09:38.567 --> 09:41.067
Come on.
You saw Brad and Agatha.

09:41.067 --> 09:43.567
There's something about that
cave that they're hiding.

09:43.567 --> 09:45.067
Don't you want to find out?

09:45.567 --> 09:47.567
Yeah, but I don't know
if we should.

- Oh, come on.
- I'm kind of scared.

- Be careful.

10:01.000 --> 10:03.500
Nah.
It's something else.

- Look!
- That's no "aurora boring Alice."

- Aurora borealis.
- Whatever.

- No?

I want you to listen very carefully.

12:16.967 --> 12:19.000
[ Terri Screams ]

12:21.000 --> 12:23.600
In the year 1641,

12:23.600 --> 12:26.833
a group of pilgrims
sailed from England...

12:26.833 --> 12:28.833
to begin a new life here.

12:28.833 --> 12:30.600
But when they arrived,

12:30.600 --> 12:34.767
they faced the most
horrible winter imaginable.

12:34.767 --> 12:38.167
No proper shelter,
not enough food.

12:38.167 --> 12:42.433

for any of that.

12:44.433 --> 12:47.500
So cold, so hungry.

12:47.500 --> 12:50.000
Their blood froze in their veins.

12:50.000 --> 12:53.667
One by one, they perished.

12:53.667 --> 12:56.700
Their deaths were
so awful, so painful,

12:56.700 --> 13:00.633
that some refused to go to
their final resting place,

13:01.133 --> 13:03.000

- I told you.

- But I dare not leave.
- No!

13:28.733 --> 13:31.600
Sam and Louisa are just kids--
kids like us.

13:31.600 --> 13:34.167
They're not evil.

13:35.067 --> 13:37.767
- What are you gonna do?
- Let you go.

13:37.767 --> 13:39.300
Why?

13:39.300 --> 13:41.500
Because you won't listen to me.

13:41.500 --> 13:44.000
He's gonna eat us, Jerry.

13:45.200 --> 13:48.800
Go to the graveyard,
to the northeastern corner.

13:48.800 --> 13:52.167
You'll find your answer there.

13:52.167 --> 13:54.800
To the graveyard! Now!

13:59.000 --> 14:02.500
- Terri, slow down!
- I don't know what to believe.

14:02.500 --> 14:05.000
- Oh, man. Me neither.
- So do you think he's a ghost?

14:05.000 --> 14:08.000
- He said Sam and Louisa were the ghosts.
- But maybe he's lying.

14:08.500 --> 14:10.500
- Look, we gotta go to the graveyard.
- I don't want to.

14:10.500 --> 14:14.000
We gotta check it out. The northeastern
corner. That's what he said, right?

14:14.000 --> 14:17.500
- [ Dog Barking ]
- [ Gasps ]

14:17.500 --> 14:19.000
Okay.

14:21.467 --> 14:23.500
[ Thunder Rumbling ]

14:28.967 --> 14:32.467
The ocean's behind us,
so... it's this way.

14:36.300 --> 14:38.300
- [ Growling ]
- What was that?

14:38.300 --> 14:40.300
I don't know.

14:41.800 --> 14:43.800
Let's keep going.

14:54.133 --> 14:55.867
[ Jerry ]
"Louisa Sadler."

14:56.367 --> 14:57.867
"Samuel Sadler."

14:57.867 --> 14:59.667
Louisa and Sam.

15:01.033 --> 15:03.467
- This is getting weirder all the time.
- [ Sam ] Hey!

15:03.867 --> 15:05.867
[ Gasps ]

15:06.333 --> 15:09.133
- I'm glad you guys are okay.
- We've been looking for you.

15:09.533 --> 15:12.033
- What are you doing here?
- Are you all right?

15:12.033 --> 15:13.000
- We saw him.
- Who?

15:13.667 --> 15:15.667
The ghost.

15:17.167 --> 15:19.433
- Oh, no.
- In the cave.

15:19.433 --> 15:21.300
He really lives in there.

15:21.300 --> 15:23.533
We've been here all our lives
and never seen him.

15:23.967 --> 15:26.933
- Well, we did.
- Did he see you?

15:26.933 --> 15:28.767
Yeah.

15:29.700 --> 15:31.833
[ Sighs ]
That's not good.

15:33.933 --> 15:36.267
How did you get away?

15:36.267 --> 15:38.267
He let us go.
He said he's not a ghost.

15:38.267 --> 15:41.000
He told us to come here
to look for something.

15:41.000 --> 15:44.400
- To look for what?
- Your gravestones.

15:44.400 --> 15:46.767
[ Sighs ]

15:46.767 --> 15:49.800
That ghost is clever-- making
you think we're the ghosts.

15:49.800 --> 15:53.600
[ Louisa ] And you believe it.
You do! I can tell by your faces.

15:54.267 --> 15:56.367
If you're not ghosts,
then where did these come from?

15:56.367 --> 16:00.667
Our ancestors. We just got
named after them, that's all.

16:00.667 --> 16:03.933
Now we're gonna show you something.
This is why we were looking for you.

16:03.933 --> 16:08.633
Let me show you what the ghost of
Harrison Sadler is planning for you.

16:12.133 --> 16:14.133
- [ Jerry ] What is it?
- You need to see it.

16:14.633 --> 16:16.633
- We need you to believe us.
- [ Terri ] Believe what?

16:17.133 --> 16:19.633
Here it is.
See for yourself.

16:22.267 --> 16:24.067
[ Terri ]
"Jerry Sadler"...

16:25.800 --> 16:27.533
and "Terri Sadler."

16:28.367 --> 16:29.633
Our graves?

16:30.233 --> 16:33.467
Freshly placed gravestones
for you and your sister.

16:33.467 --> 16:36.967
- This is what the ghost didn't want you to see.
- What does he want?

16:36.967 --> 16:41.800
What do you think? To eat you
and bury your bones right here.

16:41.800 --> 16:45.300
He saw you, Jerry. He'll come
out of the cave and find you.

16:45.300 --> 16:46.533
- No, he won't.
- [ Sam ] Yes, he will!

16:47.267 --> 16:48.933
He won't stop till he gets you.

16:48.933 --> 16:50.467
[ Louisa ]
Your lives are in danger!

16:50.467 --> 16:51.967
[ Terri ]
So what do you think we should do?

16:52.467 --> 16:55.967
Get rid of the ghost.
Stop this evil once and for all.

16:56.467 --> 16:57.967
[ Terri ]
How are we supposed to do that?

16:58.467 --> 17:01.967
- Seal him up in his cave with rocks.
- Rocks? But he's a ghost!

17:02.467 --> 17:03.467
Can't he float through that stuff?

17:03.967 --> 17:05.967
The legend says
the cave is a sanctuary.

17:06.967 --> 17:09.833
If something evil gets trapped inside,
it can't get out.

17:09.833 --> 17:13.233
So that's what you have to do--
trap the ghost.

17:13.233 --> 17:14.267
Remember, Jerry?

17:14.666 --> 17:16.833
That's what he thought
you were trying to do-- trap him.

17:16.833 --> 17:19.032
You're right.

17:19.032 --> 17:22.666
You have to attack him
before he attacks you.

17:22.666 --> 17:25.367
But... if he's evil,
why haven't you done it already?

17:25.367 --> 17:30.467
We live here. If we mess up,
the ghost won't stop at killing us.

17:30.467 --> 17:33.600
He'll haunt our house,
our family,

17:33.600 --> 17:35.433
get revenge forever.

17:35.433 --> 17:39.100
[ Louisa ] You saw your graves.
You want to live, don't you?

17:39.667 --> 17:43.767
[ Thunder Rumbling ]

17:48.633 --> 17:52.133
- We'll keep watch.
- No. You'll come with us!

17:52.133 --> 17:54.600
I can't, Jerry. I'm scared.

17:54.600 --> 17:57.533
Here. Just use it as a lever.

18:07.167 --> 18:10.033
- [ Jerry Grunting ]
- That's it! Do it!

18:10.033 --> 18:12.567
- [ Grunts ]
- [ Sam ] Just a little more.

18:17.267 --> 18:19.900
- [ Thunderclap ]
- [ Louisa Screams ]

18:21.400 --> 18:25.500
Well, well, well.
Here we all are.

18:27.333 --> 18:30.600
You've done well,
bringing the ghosts to me.

18:30.600 --> 18:32.100
Ghosts? Us?

18:32.100 --> 18:34.767
- [ Louisa ] You're the ghost!
- Jerry, the rocks!

18:35.200 --> 18:37.000
You've terrified people long enough.

18:37.000 --> 18:40.933
- Liar!
- [ Whistling ]

18:41.367 --> 18:43.600
- [ Growling, Barking ]
- [ Sam Gasps ]

18:44.000 --> 18:47.333
- Get away!
- [ Jerry ] The dogs!

18:47.333 --> 18:48.867
Remember, Louisa?

18:49.667 --> 18:53.100
You said it yourself--
Dogs recognize ghosts!

18:53.100 --> 18:56.100
- [ Barking Continues ]
- Dogs bark at ghosts.

18:58.200 --> 19:00.667
Bring them to me.

19:00.667 --> 19:02.667
We never had a chance to live!

19:02.667 --> 19:05.133
The first winter!
It wasn't fair!

19:05.133 --> 19:08.133
We never had a life at all!

19:08.133 --> 19:10.200
We all died in the cold.

19:11.133 --> 19:14.133
[ Barking Continues ]
- Hungry! We were so hungry!

19:14.133 --> 19:18.433
- [ Screams ]
- Stay with us, Cousins!

19:18.833 --> 19:22.067
Join us!
We dug such nice graves for you!

19:23.333 --> 19:26.833
Stay with us, please!

19:28.233 --> 19:30.633
[ Screams ]

19:38.833 --> 19:41.000
[ Thunder Rumbling ]

19:42.367 --> 19:46.033
Jerry, next time you see me
sleeping, don't wake me up.

19:46.467 --> 19:48.967
[ Thunder Continues ]

19:54.467 --> 19:57.967
They were always popping up out
of nowhere, freaking us out.

19:57.967 --> 20:02.000
But Louisa seemed so nice.
That's what's so scary.

20:02.000 --> 20:04.167
Well, that's quite the story, kids.

20:04.667 --> 20:05.933
We didn't know where you'd gone.

20:05.933 --> 20:08.367
Well, I'd say you've had
quite the fright.

20:08.367 --> 20:12.867
Quite the fright. But it's all
over now and best forgotten.

20:13.300 --> 20:15.300
[ Dog Barking ]

20:22.167 --> 20:25.600
Harrison Sadler's dog.

20:25.600 --> 20:28.000
- [ Barking Continues ]
- It must've gotten out of the cave.

20:28.000 --> 20:31.500
[ Growling, Barks ]

20:32.300 --> 20:33.700
Easy, boy. Easy.

20:33.700 --> 20:35.700
[ Thunderclap ]

20:35.700 --> 20:39.933
Bad dog, giving away
our little secret like that.

20:43.367 --> 20:47.867
Maybe he's not such a bad dog, Brad.

20:47.867 --> 20:51.367
Maybe he's quite a good dog.

20:51.867 --> 20:54.267
[ Barking Continues ]

20:54.667 --> 20:58.000
Maybe you're right.
It's a little early for breakfast.

20:59.767 --> 21:03.567
Terri, Jerry, why don't you
kids go and set the table...

21:03.567 --> 21:05.867
while Agatha gets busy in the kitchen.

21:05.867 --> 21:07.700
[ Thunderclap ]

21:08.700 --> 21:11.533
And don't say you're not hungry.

21:14.133 --> 21:16.300
