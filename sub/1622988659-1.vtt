00:38.138 --> 00:42.074
Life is
an immobile, locked,

00:42.109 --> 00:45.033
three-handed struggle
between your wants,

00:45.068 --> 00:48.311
the world's for you, and worse.

00:49.875 --> 00:51.974
The unbeatable slow machine,

00:53.043 --> 00:54.515
that brings what you'll get.

00:56.189 --> 01:00.125
Blocked, they strain
round a hollow stasis

01:01.194 --> 01:05.130
of havings-to, fear, faces.

01:06.694 --> 01:08.760
Days sift down it constantly.

01:10.467 --> 01:11.235
Years.

01:24.415 --> 01:29.418
- No, it's in a
movie!

01:34.557 --> 01:39.054
No, he's behind the
curtain!

01:40.497 --> 01:44.763
It's a little boy
ghost.

01:48.098 --> 01:50.571
- It's my bet, he's so
, I love her so much.

01:50.606 --> 01:52.507
Yeah,
I'll be right out!

01:53.741 --> 01:57.182
- I really, I really
love her.

01:59.219 --> 02:01.516
You didn't know, you
didn't know you were like-

02:01.551 --> 02:02.979
Hello.

02:08.624 --> 02:11.559
My whole body's
swollen.

02:27.643 --> 02:29.313
- Hey, this you?

02:29.348 --> 02:30.743
- Yeah, yeah.

02:30.778 --> 02:32.316
That's all you got?

02:32.351 --> 02:35.385
- It's all I have in
the world, man in a van.

02:35.420 --> 02:36.221
Let's go.

02:40.359 --> 02:42.425
- I just think it's weird.

02:42.460 --> 02:44.823
- Since when are you
so particular about
who crashes here

02:44.858 --> 02:45.626
for a few days?
- We're supposed

02:45.661 --> 02:46.561
to be working.

02:46.596 --> 02:48.233
- She's not gonna be in the way.

02:48.268 --> 02:49.564
She has nowhere to go.

02:49.599 --> 02:52.127
These roommates of hers
are really terrible.

02:52.162 --> 02:54.129
She said she was
afraid of retribution.

02:54.164 --> 02:55.735
- What?

02:55.770 --> 02:58.342
- That was the word she used,
that's heavy shit, Eleanor.

02:58.377 --> 02:59.904
- Retribution? Hey, Danielle.

03:01.512 --> 03:03.072
Hey.

03:03.107 --> 03:05.679
- Hey, ah, what
kind of retribution?

03:05.714 --> 03:09.221
- Oh, well, actual physical.

03:09.256 --> 03:12.015
See, they know I was the one
who called

03:12.050 --> 03:13.852
Brittany's mom
about the cocaine.

03:13.887 --> 03:15.590
After my bag got stolen
right out of the apartment,

03:15.625 --> 03:18.021
they have all sorts
coming in and out lately.

03:18.056 --> 03:20.463
People who aren't exactly
part of my demo, you know?

03:20.498 --> 03:21.992
Woke up in bed the other night

03:22.027 --> 03:24.566
with a big Latin guy standing
over me, high as hell.

03:24.601 --> 03:26.194
Said he was looking
for the bathroom,

03:26.229 --> 03:28.900
but, felt like a warning.

03:28.935 --> 03:31.408
Had to get out, had
to get out today,

03:31.443 --> 03:33.608
and I'm awfully sorry.
- Your demo?

03:33.643 --> 03:35.203
- I'm sorry, was that...

03:35.238 --> 03:38.041
- You don't think they
followed us, do you?

03:40.287 --> 03:44.982
- Um, I don't have any
advice to give you guys,

03:45.017 --> 03:46.016
just play it better.

03:47.921 --> 03:49.217
Okay?

03:49.252 --> 03:51.461
Yeah, I
know, let's drink some water.

04:16.356 --> 04:19.885
in deep distress

04:27.928 --> 04:32.337
someone her age

04:32.372 --> 04:36.033
no, you hate him

04:40.347 --> 04:44.239
about cruelty

04:53.789 --> 04:58.330
the bond, oh no

05:43.872 --> 05:45.509
- I know it's not interesting,

05:45.544 --> 05:48.512
but pencils are a
thing that we need.

05:48.547 --> 05:50.206
So somebody's gotta go.

05:52.078 --> 05:54.276
I can't, I've got company.

05:58.381 --> 05:59.182
Alright.

06:00.383 --> 06:02.988
Well, send Barry out for
them, what's he doing?

06:03.023 --> 06:04.627
- Excuse me.

06:04.662 --> 06:05.694
- Oh, hello.

06:07.258 --> 06:09.401
My name's Gerard.

06:09.436 --> 06:11.667
You were really full
of beans last night.

06:13.473 --> 06:16.474
Oh, don't worry, you're
unviolated.

06:16.509 --> 06:19.334
Where were you afraid you
were when you woke up?

06:19.369 --> 06:21.479
- In a stranger's apartment?

06:21.514 --> 06:23.041
Where's my phone?

06:24.242 --> 06:25.582
- Ah, well, it
won't work in here,

06:25.617 --> 06:27.782
but your bag's on the
floor beside the bed.

06:28.983 --> 06:30.884
Yeah, you know, you
were,

06:30.919 --> 06:32.347
you were trying to hail a cab,

06:32.382 --> 06:33.953
but you were kind of
alienating all the drivers.

06:33.988 --> 06:36.659
- I don't remember anything.
- I was worried, you know,

06:36.694 --> 06:40.432
because you're teetering
all over the road

06:40.467 --> 06:43.226
and terrible things happen
to drunk women in this city.

06:44.427 --> 06:45.998
I told you it's not
gonna work in here.

06:46.033 --> 06:48.572
- Yours did, hey,
who are you anyway?

06:48.607 --> 06:51.542
- Gerard, I work
in law enforcement.

06:52.512 --> 06:54.369
You wanna have some breakfast?

06:54.404 --> 06:57.515
- I don't, this is your place?

06:57.550 --> 06:59.374
Hm, it belongs
to the department.

06:59.409 --> 07:01.112
- And where did you
sleep last night?

07:01.147 --> 07:02.487
- Oh, I didn't.

07:04.557 --> 07:07.591
Ooh!

07:07.626 --> 07:10.858
Yeah, still muzzy, I bet.
- Oh, God.

07:10.893 --> 07:13.861
- Come on, let me get you
a bite to eat downstairs.

07:13.896 --> 07:15.500
You wouldn't know how
to find your way home

07:15.535 --> 07:16.567
from here anyway.

07:21.838 --> 07:23.475
- Show me your badge.

07:31.584 --> 07:33.441
Which borough are we in?

07:33.476 --> 07:35.344
- Queens technically.

07:36.589 --> 07:38.589
- And you're in law enforcement?

07:40.120 --> 07:42.692
- Yep, NYPD Intel, not to be
confused with those jokers

07:42.727 --> 07:45.156
over at the Joint
Terrorism Taskforce,

07:45.191 --> 07:47.532
those guys are all deputized

07:47.567 --> 07:50.062
and I will not be so crass
as to tell you what I, think,

07:50.097 --> 07:52.504
that is a cinnamon,
oh, that was quick.

07:55.542 --> 07:57.707
- And you do what exactly?

07:57.742 --> 08:01.744
- Well, let's see, you know
those uniformed, PD thugs,

08:01.779 --> 08:04.076
who are always accidentally
killing people?

08:04.111 --> 08:05.847
Ah-huh.

08:05.882 --> 08:08.443
- Well, when I
eliminate someone,

08:08.478 --> 08:11.655
the action is always
sanctioned and covert.

08:11.690 --> 08:13.382
- You're sort of whimsical?

08:13.417 --> 08:14.955
Yeah,
well, you gotta be,

08:14.990 --> 08:16.693
if you're gonna do the big work.

08:16.728 --> 08:18.695
- Oh and if I
raise the slightest
objection to that work,

08:18.730 --> 08:20.565
you're gonna tell me the
world's a dangerous place

08:20.600 --> 08:22.633
and that I don't
understand anything.

08:23.702 --> 08:25.504
- Understand isn't
the word I'd use.

08:26.837 --> 08:28.133
You're an actress?

08:29.301 --> 08:32.676
- How do you know what I do?

08:32.711 --> 08:33.710
Have I a file?

08:36.143 --> 08:39.045
- Maybe, no, I've
seen you on stage.

08:41.313 --> 08:43.885
Yeah, really, in a
Richard Foreman show

08:43.920 --> 08:45.821
back when he was still
down on St. Mark's.

08:45.856 --> 08:49.561
There was a lot of um, wire

08:49.596 --> 08:52.597
and, and, sledgehammers,
chalkboards.

08:54.601 --> 08:57.965
Yeah, my fiancee, Lysette
is a big aficionado

08:58.000 --> 09:01.496
of you know, so called
downtown theater,

09:01.531 --> 09:04.840
although lately she say
I watch too much video.

09:04.875 --> 09:06.776
But you were really
great in the play,

09:08.571 --> 09:11.946
even if I don't know
exactly what I mean by that.

09:11.981 --> 09:15.818
But what you were
doing was so strenuous.

09:17.349 --> 09:20.449
- How does Lysette feel about
you being out all night?

09:20.484 --> 09:22.517
- I don't know, it
happens, Lysette, look,

09:22.552 --> 09:25.894
Lysette gets me
for the most part.

09:27.667 --> 09:31.669
So things aren't going
so well career wise, huh?

09:31.704 --> 09:33.902
- A girl can have a
drink for any old reason.

09:35.433 --> 09:36.674
You're intel work?

09:38.601 --> 09:40.568
- Yeah, you know, I
shouldn't have said anything,

09:40.603 --> 09:43.010
but I feel comfortable
with you, you know,

09:43.045 --> 09:46.046
there's something about easing
a woman's shoes off for her.

09:46.081 --> 09:47.377
- Counter terrorism?

09:48.721 --> 09:50.952
- Yeah, and all that
that word entails.

09:50.987 --> 09:54.824
My department has
international reach,

09:57.697 --> 09:59.422
I know, I know, I'm
the devil, right?

09:59.457 --> 10:01.358
This is where you reach
for your revolver.

10:01.393 --> 10:03.668
- It just seems like a
grand misadventure to me.

10:05.738 --> 10:07.705
- You read that
phrase somewhere.

10:09.742 --> 10:11.940
No, grand isn't the right
word, too much blood.

10:13.207 --> 10:14.602
But hey, think what
you want, you know,

10:14.637 --> 10:16.813
you'll be back to your
demographic soon enough.

10:16.848 --> 10:19.717
- My demographic?
- Hm-mm, Brooklyn.

10:21.479 --> 10:22.918
Christ, what is
Brooklyn anymore?

10:22.953 --> 10:26.614
Brooklyn is a white toddler
in a Run DMC T-shirt.

10:29.421 --> 10:31.828
I'm not gonna, I'm not
gonna defend myself to you,

10:31.863 --> 10:34.699
I'm just gonna continue to
feel good about the fact

10:34.734 --> 10:36.899
that I have helped
to prevent things,

10:36.934 --> 10:39.099
that might have hurt you.
- Like what?

10:40.630 --> 10:44.599
- I can't go into details,
but it would've been painful

10:44.634 --> 10:46.535
and it would've been slow

10:46.570 --> 10:49.538
and it would've
happened to a crowd.

10:49.573 --> 10:52.013
You would've had to watch
everybody else suffering,

10:52.048 --> 10:54.411
even while you, you know,
because it's, it's funny,

10:54.446 --> 10:56.479
everybody's afraid
of kicking it alone,

10:56.514 --> 10:59.350
but I for one can't
think of anything worse

10:59.385 --> 11:03.860
than a deliberately paced,
collective perishing,

11:03.895 --> 11:06.995
be it like you're all
dying in front of me or...

11:11.595 --> 11:12.671
- I don't believe you.

11:14.939 --> 11:16.708
- You gonna eat that?

11:24.674 --> 11:26.443
We can, we can meet
again if you want to.

11:26.478 --> 11:28.643
I don't think so.

11:28.678 --> 11:31.679
- Ah, if it'd help you
professionally, you know.

11:31.714 --> 11:33.285
See, I've already,

11:33.320 --> 11:35.727
I've already developed a
sort of affection for you.

11:35.762 --> 11:37.487
- How does meeting you again
professionally help me?

11:37.522 --> 11:39.456
- But that's my curse, you know,

11:39.491 --> 11:41.359
I'm emotionally promiscuous.

11:42.527 --> 11:45.264
I like to think it
comes from a sort of,

11:45.299 --> 11:47.332
well, what I hope is
a healthy curiosity.

11:47.367 --> 11:50.709
You know, I couldn't do the
work I do, if I wasn't curious.

11:51.976 --> 11:54.944
But there are, there are
risks, you know, to be sure.

11:56.783 --> 11:58.981
Hey, hey, hey, wait.
- Bye.

11:59.016 --> 11:59.916
- Hey, hey.

12:00.919 --> 12:01.852
Here.

12:02.745 --> 12:03.755
Take it.

12:08.861 --> 12:11.191
- Hey, did you really
ever kill anyone?

12:13.393 --> 12:14.964
- I've felt like it though.

13:55.968 --> 13:57.297
- Did we wake you?

13:57.332 --> 13:58.826
- I was already awake.

13:58.861 --> 14:00.905
Couldn't sleep for all
the quiet last night.

14:00.940 --> 14:04.700
Totally.

14:06.275 --> 14:07.538
You wanna play?

14:08.508 --> 14:09.914
- No, thanks.

14:09.949 --> 14:13.214
Never been for me,
never liked the sounds,

14:13.249 --> 14:14.842
all that crashing and grunting.

14:14.877 --> 14:16.481
This is touch.

14:16.516 --> 14:19.550
- 10 pounds of extra clothes
just to play a Goddamn game,

14:19.585 --> 14:22.355
never made sense
to me, none of it.

14:24.997 --> 14:26.359
Y'all get a newspaper up here?

14:26.394 --> 14:30.759
Get a
paper, a paper, no.

14:30.794 --> 14:32.937
What are you reading?

14:32.972 --> 14:34.939
- I just found it on the shelf.

14:37.009 --> 14:40.109
- "Children dissipate the
longing for immorality."

14:40.144 --> 14:41.671
- No, immortality.

14:41.706 --> 14:45.884
- "Which is the compensation
of the childless writer's work,

14:47.316 --> 14:49.316
but it is not only a question
of children or children,

14:49.351 --> 14:52.550
there is a moment when the
cult of home and happiness

14:52.585 --> 14:54.926
becomes harmful on
domestic happiness."

14:54.961 --> 14:56.686
- You know what?
- Damn.

14:56.721 --> 14:58.094
- I think I will play.

14:59.790 --> 15:00.591
- Alright.

15:03.167 --> 15:04.969
Come on, guys, we can
do this, just go long,

15:05.004 --> 15:06.564
we're gonna go head that way.
- I just throw it, right?

15:06.599 --> 15:09.105
- Yeah, I'm gonna throw
it right, ready? Hut!

15:09.140 --> 15:10.403
Hut!

15:10.438 --> 15:11.470
Hike!

15:11.505 --> 15:12.702
Go, go, go, go, go!
- Ah!

15:12.737 --> 15:14.176
- Back, back!

15:14.211 --> 15:16.904
- Fuck, fuck!

15:16.939 --> 15:17.740
Fuck!

15:19.150 --> 15:21.678
- I'm fine, I'm fine.
- Why didn't you catch it?

15:21.713 --> 15:23.086
- Jim, you know what?
- I'm a mess

15:23.121 --> 15:26.155
at this football nonsense.
- It's not nonsense.

15:39.731 --> 15:40.532
Hmm!

15:41.832 --> 15:43.733
- Of course Sweden is a
vastly different country

15:43.768 --> 15:46.703
in terms of its
relationship to addiction.

15:46.738 --> 15:48.144
The state provides treatment

15:48.179 --> 15:52.445
just like it would any other
disease, but you know what,

15:52.480 --> 15:55.910
I've found something and I
don't know how this sounds

15:55.945 --> 15:58.990
or if this is the right
place to say this,

15:59.025 --> 16:00.222
but I like the shame.

16:01.456 --> 16:04.457
It has benefited me
to feel embarrassed.

16:04.492 --> 16:06.855
No, but that's how
we grow, right?

16:06.890 --> 16:11.365
Not just the self care, but
the intense self laceration.

16:13.039 --> 16:15.468
I mean, based on standards
that are not even ours,

16:15.503 --> 16:18.042
I mean, why are we here
right now by and large?

16:18.077 --> 16:23.080
Because we embarrassed ourselves
at a wedding or a picnic.

16:23.676 --> 16:24.246
- Yeah.
- Right?

16:24.281 --> 16:25.676
- Picnic.

16:25.711 --> 16:28.019
- Because we did
something horrible

16:28.054 --> 16:30.681
in spectacularly public
fashion in broad daylight

16:30.716 --> 16:32.683
and someone took
us aside and said,

16:32.718 --> 16:33.948
"You should be
ashamed of yourself."

16:33.983 --> 16:36.621
Because we hadn't been
and they were right.

16:36.656 --> 16:37.886
You know, part of me wishes

16:37.921 --> 16:40.493
that this wasn't
such a safe place,

16:40.528 --> 16:43.991
I wouldn't mind relying on
a little bit more judgment

16:44.026 --> 16:45.102
from you people.

16:46.105 --> 16:48.468
You know, other people
then maybe you, Jeffrey,

16:48.503 --> 16:50.173
what is your deal
anyway, Jeffrey?

16:50.208 --> 16:53.506
Is it just me or is
the rage general?

16:53.541 --> 16:55.310
Because I wasn't
the one who gave you

16:55.345 --> 16:57.180
your first drink, buddy.

16:57.215 --> 16:58.577
- Stephanie.
- No,

16:58.612 --> 17:00.007
but it feels like
it's just with me.

17:00.042 --> 17:01.118
- It's not just you,

17:01.153 --> 17:03.120
he's already told us
he hates all of us.

17:04.486 --> 17:07.014
- Alright, where was I?

17:07.049 --> 17:09.126
- Shame.
- Right, yes, shame.

17:10.162 --> 17:12.459
Vital, galvanizing

17:13.858 --> 17:14.659
and I,

17:16.333 --> 17:18.498
yeah, that's pretty much it.

17:19.501 --> 17:21.567
The week was uneventful.

17:33.185 --> 17:35.416
- Hello.
- Are you kidding me?

17:35.451 --> 17:37.748
Does the word anonymous
mean nothing to you?

17:37.783 --> 17:40.421
- Oh, come on, we both
know you're just doing this

17:40.456 --> 17:42.951
for research or something.
- How do we both know that?

17:42.986 --> 17:45.195
Look, I didn't call you.
- Hey, hey, hey, listen.

17:46.330 --> 17:48.429
Don't ride the subway
today, do me a favor.

17:48.464 --> 17:50.167
- Why not?

17:50.202 --> 17:52.367
Oh, you have some
information, is that it?

17:52.402 --> 17:53.764
- Oh, yeah, much too much,

17:53.799 --> 17:55.700
it's a wonder I manage
to stay so even keel.

17:55.735 --> 17:57.273
Look, it's probably nothing

17:57.308 --> 18:00.342
and the stations are all
crawling with JTTF jerk offs,

18:00.377 --> 18:03.147
but just as a precaution,
let me give you a lift.

18:06.548 --> 18:08.713
- You know, I've been
wondering for a long time

18:08.748 --> 18:10.187
when the subway's
gonna get blown up.

18:10.222 --> 18:13.289
I mean, why hasn't it
already? It seems really easy.

18:13.324 --> 18:15.984
- Well, you could do it if
you want to.

18:16.019 --> 18:18.327
- It's not really
gonna happen, is it?

18:18.362 --> 18:20.197
- Probably not, but you know,

18:20.232 --> 18:22.826
butterfly flaps its
wings in Syria and boom!

18:24.368 --> 18:26.896
Hey, doesn't it mean anything
to you that I'm here?

18:26.931 --> 18:28.205
- I don't think I know anyone,

18:28.240 --> 18:30.108
who's taking the
subway right now.

18:31.573 --> 18:32.935
Hey, Jeffrey.

18:32.970 --> 18:34.178
- What?

18:34.213 --> 18:35.542
You're
riding your bike, right?

18:35.577 --> 18:36.543
- What's it to you?

18:39.779 --> 18:41.383
- Alright, but I
don't wanna go home,

18:41.418 --> 18:43.154
they're all there right now.

18:43.189 --> 18:45.981
- Well, I was just
thinking we'd, you know.

18:48.854 --> 18:51.558
Oh, she's at home,
Lysette's always at home

18:51.593 --> 18:53.989
working on her
thesis, anthropology.

18:54.024 --> 18:55.958
- What's it about?

18:55.993 --> 18:59.126
Well, you
know pornography?

18:59.161 --> 19:00.567
- Yes.

19:00.602 --> 19:04.967
Well, Lysette is
interested in what she calls

19:06.069 --> 19:08.036
the narrative couching
of the sex act,

19:08.071 --> 19:09.642
you know, like
the preliminaries,

19:09.677 --> 19:13.646
the proverbial pizza boy who
gets lucky with the housewife,

19:13.681 --> 19:15.978
the plumber, you know.

19:16.013 --> 19:18.189
- Does porn even still
have those things?

19:18.224 --> 19:20.114
- Oh yeah, still has everything.

19:20.149 --> 19:24.327
But she's not just talking
about ostensible plots,

19:24.362 --> 19:28.122
she's also interested in
the way internet clips

19:28.157 --> 19:32.467
are captioned, the names
given things, you know,

19:32.502 --> 19:36.735
a velvet afternoon
or a game of chess.

19:36.770 --> 19:37.571
Chess.

19:39.069 --> 19:41.773
- Yeah, no, indeed, they're
playing chess for some reason

19:41.808 --> 19:43.511
and then all of a
sudden, you know.

19:45.614 --> 19:48.043
But I mean, it could be
just as simple as, you know,

19:48.078 --> 19:51.387
Johnny goes down,
but the point is that

19:51.422 --> 19:55.622
it can never ever be just
anonymous people having sex,

19:55.657 --> 19:58.823
it always has to be
contextualized in some way

19:58.858 --> 20:01.892
and Lysette's argument
is that, you know,

20:01.927 --> 20:05.060
pornography's not
reactionary just because,

20:05.095 --> 20:09.273
because of, ah, misogyny or
because of industrial practices

20:09.308 --> 20:12.276
or whatever, but
that it turns out

20:12.311 --> 20:15.070
that even the most
aberrant sexual fantasy

20:17.140 --> 20:19.811
requires some sort of narrative
buffer zone, you know.

20:19.846 --> 20:22.484
It's kind of depressing
when you think about it.

20:22.519 --> 20:26.180
Or at least
she says, I don't know,

20:26.215 --> 20:28.853
I'm glossing over a lot,
you watch porn, right?

20:28.888 --> 20:31.526
You might
have just ruined it for me.

20:31.561 --> 20:32.725
- Oh, well.

20:32.760 --> 20:34.958
Why
aren't you with her now?

20:35.829 --> 20:37.268
- Ah, I'm a distraction.

20:37.303 --> 20:39.127
You talk a lot.

20:39.162 --> 20:41.228
- Well, how else are you
gonna get to know me?

20:41.263 --> 20:42.669
- I didn't say I wanted to.

20:42.704 --> 20:45.034
What are you doing?

20:45.069 --> 20:47.036
- Ah, just making
sure the last guest

20:47.071 --> 20:49.071
cleaned up after himself.

20:49.106 --> 20:52.481
- You know, I am glad
to see you again,

20:52.516 --> 20:54.846
I mean, look at you,
you're for fucking real.

20:54.881 --> 20:56.716
- You know, sometimes I
worry about the effect

20:56.751 --> 21:00.324
of all those images, you know,
but what am I, her father?

21:00.359 --> 21:02.183
I mean, if she says it's fine.

21:03.560 --> 21:06.858
Okay, all clear probably.

21:07.729 --> 21:09.300
- Are you looking for bugs?

21:09.335 --> 21:11.896
You pepper
me with questions.

21:11.931 --> 21:13.304
- Is someone listening?

21:13.339 --> 21:15.306
Probably not.

21:16.936 --> 21:20.641
- I can't imagine you're
supposed to have me here.

21:20.676 --> 21:23.314
I don't ask
you so many questions.

21:23.349 --> 21:25.580
- That's because
you know everything.

21:25.615 --> 21:28.913
- Ah, it'd be a mistake to
assume we know everything,

21:28.948 --> 21:31.080
a woman is not her
search history.

21:31.115 --> 21:33.621
Lysette would be the first
person to tell you that.

21:34.789 --> 21:37.361
So, anything coming
up acting wise?

21:37.396 --> 21:39.495
- Audition for a film.

21:39.530 --> 21:41.893
It's a low budget thing,
I play a girl from Texas.

21:41.928 --> 21:43.697
Oh yeah,
what's her deal?

21:44.997 --> 21:47.261
- She's addled, on the run.

21:47.296 --> 21:50.968
- And how does a Swedish woman
get inside a girl from Texas?

21:51.003 --> 21:53.377
The voice first.

21:53.412 --> 21:55.313
Hey, isn't rush hour
just about over?

21:56.976 --> 22:00.879
- Almost, it ends at eight
now, so you can't be too safe.

22:00.914 --> 22:03.046
Well, let's hear
the voice, wait.

22:07.789 --> 22:12.286
See, I'm from Georgia
originally, different
lilt, cadence,

22:12.321 --> 22:14.464
but you know, might be helpful.

22:15.258 --> 22:16.829
- I don't think so.

22:16.864 --> 22:19.403
- Well, we're kind of stuck
here for the time being.

22:19.438 --> 22:20.635
- Are we?

22:20.670 --> 22:22.296
- Might as well
make it productive.

22:22.331 --> 22:24.507
It'd be an honor.
-  Oh, my God.

22:24.542 --> 22:26.135
- And like I said,
I've already developed

22:26.170 --> 22:27.609
a kind of affection for you.

22:31.846 --> 22:33.307
- Why don't you just shut up?

22:33.342 --> 22:35.914
There you go.

22:35.949 --> 22:37.212
- I can't sleep.

22:38.457 --> 22:40.116
Can't.

22:40.151 --> 22:45.154
Thinking about mankind
being made in God's image,

22:46.498 --> 22:47.860
thinking about him
probably being the ugliest,

22:47.895 --> 22:50.665
pockmarked motherfucker
that ever made a world.

22:50.700 --> 22:52.194
Pass.

22:52.229 --> 22:54.438
- Shit isn't even north
or it's south anymore.

22:55.507 --> 22:57.199
No point to anything.

22:57.234 --> 22:59.168
Maybe that's why
I did what I did.

23:00.446 --> 23:01.874
- What did you do?

23:01.909 --> 23:06.879
- None of your business, stopped
confessing a long time ago.

23:07.882 --> 23:09.684
Doesn't mean I feel bad,

23:09.719 --> 23:11.587
maybe just means
I've come to like it.

23:13.459 --> 23:16.218
Nice kind of heat comes
off the wrong thing.

23:17.496 --> 23:21.256
Kind of heat makes you
rethink the definitions.

23:21.291 --> 23:23.357
- Ha, addled was right.

23:23.392 --> 23:25.667
- You don't know
me, motherfucker.

23:25.702 --> 23:28.263
We're just killing
time till it runs out.

23:29.266 --> 23:30.870
You're pretty enough.

23:30.905 --> 23:32.641
- Oh, yeah?

23:32.676 --> 23:33.873
- Enough.

23:36.009 --> 23:38.911
My men are all just
pretty enough now,

23:38.946 --> 23:41.683
that's my pay grade, enough.

23:41.718 --> 23:43.982
After what I've done.

23:44.017 --> 23:45.456
- Tell me.

23:45.491 --> 23:48.118
You'd
just get turned on.

23:49.495 --> 23:52.991
Goddammit, the only person
I like talking to anymore

23:53.026 --> 23:56.500
is my kid, she just wants
me to tell her what to do.

23:57.503 --> 24:00.031
Too young to wonder
about most things,

24:00.066 --> 24:02.198
just wants to follow the
rules better than most.

24:02.233 --> 24:03.870
You shouldn't hit me.

24:03.905 --> 24:06.609
- Named her Jenga,
after the game,

24:06.644 --> 24:09.205
'cause she's always
gonna get back up.

24:09.240 --> 24:13.913
Little baby Jenga, plays
horsey, likes pink shit,

24:13.948 --> 24:16.443
had a fancy macaroon once,

24:16.478 --> 24:18.522
now she begs for
them all the time,

24:18.557 --> 24:20.557
the fancy ones are hard to find

24:20.592 --> 24:24.759
and they don't come
cheap, but, you got kids?

24:24.794 --> 24:27.124
- No.
- Well, that's a shame,

24:27.159 --> 24:28.499
they're a pip.

24:29.898 --> 24:32.800
I hated to leave my Jenga
behind, but what you gonna do?

24:36.333 --> 24:37.706
If I'd had my druthers,

24:37.741 --> 24:39.741
I would've blasted her off
to another planet, yeah,

24:41.074 --> 24:43.470
'cause Lord knows,

24:43.505 --> 24:46.517
nothing anyway, nothing.

24:47.685 --> 24:49.652
He's telling us to
help us out down here,

24:49.687 --> 24:53.590
He's probably busy
knocking up another virgin.

24:53.625 --> 24:56.054
People seem awfully
convinced He's coming back

24:56.089 --> 24:58.452
in some form or another,
but I don't guess

24:58.487 --> 25:01.191
that's gonna happen
till they come for us.

25:01.226 --> 25:03.996
Alright,
I get the idea.

25:04.031 --> 25:06.328
- Sorry to get you
caught up in all this.

25:06.363 --> 25:07.494
- I don't think it's really-

25:07.529 --> 25:09.496
- But you should've
known better.

25:09.531 --> 25:11.608
- My type of thing.

25:11.643 --> 25:13.742
- The pretty girl's
hitching a ride alone,

25:13.777 --> 25:16.173
there's always
somebody chasing her.

25:16.208 --> 25:17.009
- Okay.

25:18.749 --> 25:19.550
Alright.

25:20.982 --> 25:23.653
- And sometimes that somebody's
even worse than her daddy.

25:27.054 --> 25:27.855
- Alright.

25:30.629 --> 25:33.630
Don't even
get me started on Daddy.

25:35.997 --> 25:37.524
Liked to get drunk,

25:37.559 --> 25:41.132
used to put his hands in
all the wrong places saying,

25:41.167 --> 25:42.771
"Hey, I had a hand
in the manufacture,

25:42.806 --> 25:44.608
so why can't I get a little
tickle in once in a while?"

25:44.643 --> 25:46.137
At least he was kinda up front.

25:46.172 --> 25:48.744
Hm, low rent
what's his name, Sam Sheppard.

25:48.779 --> 25:51.142
- Had a beautiful
singing voice though.

25:51.177 --> 25:53.716
Why is it that broken
ass, weak ass bastards

25:53.751 --> 25:56.785
always sing like Goddamn
angels, when they've had a few?

25:57.623 --> 25:59.821
You know any songs?

25:59.856 --> 26:02.824
Be honest, it's my
thing, my yardstick,

26:02.859 --> 26:04.661
see, if you know how to sing,

26:04.696 --> 26:07.158
I'll be able to tell you're
a son of a bitch for sure.

26:07.193 --> 26:10.161
- You already think
I'm a son of a bitch.

26:10.196 --> 26:12.493
- Oh, but I need proof.

26:13.562 --> 26:17.069
- Lysette is
wondering where I am.

26:17.104 --> 26:18.708
- But you're
trapped, aren't you?

26:23.605 --> 26:24.406
Hmm!

26:27.818 --> 26:28.619
Hmm!

26:31.657 --> 26:33.184
Hmm!

26:33.219 --> 26:34.416
- Are you okay?

26:35.694 --> 26:38.090
- Let's just sit here

26:40.292 --> 26:42.523
quietly for a little while,

26:44.934 --> 26:46.703
until I get the all clear.

26:49.631 --> 26:51.466
Hmm!

26:53.338 --> 26:54.568
Hmm!

26:54.603 --> 26:56.713
- What are you doing?
- Shut up.

27:00.213 --> 27:00.948
Hmm!

27:05.119 --> 27:05.920
Hmm!

27:11.488 --> 27:12.289
Hmm.

27:13.325 --> 27:14.797
Come with me.

27:14.832 --> 27:15.930
No!

27:15.965 --> 27:18.262
- Are you ever
afraid that your nose

27:18.297 --> 27:20.671
is gonna get pushed
up inside your brain?

27:20.706 --> 27:23.674
- Hm, knew a guy it
happened to once.

27:23.709 --> 27:25.500
Well, maybe that's what it was.

27:25.535 --> 27:27.678
He got into a fight
in the oil fields.

27:27.713 --> 27:30.538
No surprise, those
guys can get rough.

27:30.573 --> 27:33.277
Mostly itinerant,
lots of Mexicans,

27:33.312 --> 27:37.149
but this was a father
of a friend, a foreman.

27:37.184 --> 27:39.756
A buddy of his came
to work plastered,

27:39.791 --> 27:42.352
my friend's dad tells him
to go home, sleep it off,

27:42.387 --> 27:46.422
he goes crazy, maybe it
wasn't just booze in him.

27:46.457 --> 27:48.864
Got a lot of meth
down there too, speed,

27:48.899 --> 27:50.899
all that cheap, small town shit.

27:50.934 --> 27:53.297
Tells my friend's dad he's got
to work to support his kids,

27:53.332 --> 27:55.167
he's got one from
the current wife

27:55.202 --> 27:57.334
and one from the last,
both little girls.

27:57.369 --> 27:59.567
My friend's dad tried
to stay real calm

27:59.602 --> 28:02.174
and everybody's
holding this guy back

28:02.209 --> 28:04.946
and the dude just
Hulk's the fuck out,

28:04.981 --> 28:08.510
throws them off, rushes my
friend's dad, Tim was his name.

28:08.545 --> 28:11.645
Comes at Tim like a crazy,
bloodshot-eyed freight train,

28:11.680 --> 28:16.793
throws him one punch, just
one, lands it perfectly.

28:17.796 --> 28:18.960
Damn, I feel bad
saying perfectly,

28:18.995 --> 28:21.556
but at just the
right angle, you know

28:21.591 --> 28:25.065
and I guess it was like he
knew what he'd done right off.

28:25.100 --> 28:28.805
There was this cracking sound
and Tim's just standing there,

28:28.840 --> 28:31.874
blood flowing down his shirt
and he doesn't fall right away.

28:31.909 --> 28:34.701
His eyes just go crazy wide

28:34.736 --> 28:37.506
and he's looking around
like somebody can help him

28:37.541 --> 28:39.882
and then there's
this terrible silence

28:39.917 --> 28:42.148
for a few long seconds

28:42.183 --> 28:44.447
and then Tim drops like a stone,

28:45.714 --> 28:49.617
dead, nose pushed right
up into his brain.

28:51.225 --> 28:54.358
The other guy's doing
10 for involuntary.

28:54.393 --> 28:56.932
Not much help to his
little girls now, is he?

28:59.937 --> 29:01.695
Thanks.

29:01.730 --> 29:02.498
- Hm.

29:02.533 --> 29:03.774
- I don't believe you.

29:03.809 --> 29:06.106
- What did you say?

29:06.141 --> 29:07.371
- That story, all of it.

29:09.144 --> 29:10.242
But it's, it's okay.

29:20.221 --> 29:21.715
- Ow!

29:21.750 --> 29:23.123
- Hi.
- Hi.

29:23.158 --> 29:25.521
- I was just about to
turn the light out.

29:25.556 --> 29:27.424
Yeah, no, I just
wanted to make sure that-

29:27.459 --> 29:28.755
- I have everything.

29:28.790 --> 29:30.460
- No, not that.

29:30.495 --> 29:35.498
I wanna make sure that you
knew the people here are good.

29:36.699 --> 29:39.337
- I wasn't afraid they
weren't.

29:39.372 --> 29:41.174
- No, I mean, maybe
good's the wrong word,

29:41.209 --> 29:42.472
it sounds like a
bunch of squares,

29:42.507 --> 29:45.673
but like they're,
they're preoccupied.

29:45.708 --> 29:47.675
No one's gonna pay
you much attention,

29:47.710 --> 29:49.776
no one's gonna ask
you a lot of questions

29:49.811 --> 29:53.087
and even if they do, nobody's
gonna listen to what you say,

29:53.122 --> 29:55.793
so I'm trying to
say you're safe.

29:57.027 --> 29:58.455
- Didn't think I wasn't.

29:59.392 --> 30:01.557
- Good.

30:01.592 --> 30:02.393
Good.

30:04.727 --> 30:06.804
Sorry, I'm a little drunk.

30:08.269 --> 30:09.136
- Sure you are.

30:11.404 --> 30:13.910
Can I just
sit for a second?

30:23.845 --> 30:25.856
- What am I waiting
for you to do?

30:27.849 --> 30:30.520
- Are you waiting for
me to do something?

30:30.555 --> 30:32.786
- No, I mean what
are you gonna do?

30:32.821 --> 30:34.260
Are you coming at me?

30:36.825 --> 30:37.626
- Can I?

30:38.827 --> 30:40.937
- Am I allowed to stay
if I don't let you?

30:46.373 --> 30:48.835
I'd really like to fuck you.

30:48.870 --> 30:51.277
You know, I'm being honest.

30:53.116 --> 30:55.083
- Like a good person.

30:55.118 --> 30:58.317
- I'm sorry, I'm going about
this badly, but I'm just,

30:59.958 --> 31:04.356
I would really love
to go down on you,

31:04.391 --> 31:05.929
you know, I really
like to do that

31:05.964 --> 31:08.624
and we could just do
that, if you wanted me to,

31:08.659 --> 31:11.935
I mean, if that would
give you some relief.

31:11.970 --> 31:13.860
- From the pressure
of sitting here

31:13.895 --> 31:14.938
listening to you talk about it?

31:14.973 --> 31:17.941
- No, I mean, I know
you're in trouble

31:17.976 --> 31:20.372
and I know you're
scared and I just,

31:21.870 --> 31:24.981
the only thing I can
give you is this place

31:25.016 --> 31:26.840
and I just wanna help
you forget about all that

31:26.875 --> 31:28.985
and if that would help
alleviate, you know,

31:29.020 --> 31:30.349
in whatever way I can.

31:30.384 --> 31:31.955
- Why didn't you just
come in here and pounce?

31:31.990 --> 31:33.649
I could've fucked you
up, if I felt like it

31:33.684 --> 31:35.057
and now we're just sitting
here chatting about it,

31:35.092 --> 31:36.784
how does that, yeah, okay.

31:38.326 --> 31:39.490
Okay.

32:00.051 --> 32:02.678
- And the evidence of my aging
isn't just in the mirror,

32:02.713 --> 32:04.581
it's in everywhere around
me, it's in the fact

32:04.616 --> 32:07.749
that when I go to people's
houses for dinner nowadays,

32:07.784 --> 32:09.916
they have to be reminded
to put on the music.

32:09.951 --> 32:11.291
- Right.
- It's in the fact

32:11.326 --> 32:12.919
that actually half
the couples I know

32:12.954 --> 32:14.723
are getting a
divorce or should be.

32:14.758 --> 32:16.032
- Time.

32:16.067 --> 32:17.396
- Already I am starting
to relate to the people,

32:17.431 --> 32:19.926
who fall asleep on the
train, to envy them.

32:19.961 --> 32:21.202
- The big wheel.

32:21.237 --> 32:22.896
- Excuse me, don't
mean to interrupt,

32:22.931 --> 32:24.898
but could I get a photo?
- People say excuse me

32:24.933 --> 32:26.537
in order to interrupt

32:26.572 --> 32:29.243
and you must see I'm talking
to someone I already know.

32:31.214 --> 32:33.346
Don't look at me like that,
don't give me that power,

32:33.381 --> 32:35.414
I don't have it, I'm a very
small part of your life,

32:35.449 --> 32:36.248
be fair to me.

32:38.023 --> 32:40.518
- And you know, it's
not really aging

32:40.553 --> 32:45.358
that I'm worried about at
all, it's dying of course,

32:45.393 --> 32:48.229
I don't want you to think
this is just about my career.

32:48.264 --> 32:51.067
Are you familiar with the
work of Philip Larkin?

32:51.102 --> 32:52.365
- Vaguely.

32:52.400 --> 32:55.236
- The great poet of
banal foreboding,

32:55.271 --> 32:58.074
the unsudden
comprehension of death,

32:58.109 --> 33:00.373
not the kind that makes
you sit up at night

33:00.408 --> 33:02.078
gasping for breath, but the kind

33:02.113 --> 33:06.049
that just sort of niggles
at you all day, every day,

33:07.085 --> 33:09.910
oh right, there's that,
an end to all of this.

33:11.254 --> 33:12.748
- If you don't
wanna feel that way,

33:12.783 --> 33:14.486
why don't you just
stop reading him?

33:14.521 --> 33:15.982
- Well, I didn't say I
didn't wanna feel this way.

33:16.017 --> 33:18.490
- 'Cause I can never tell
if you're complaining.

33:18.525 --> 33:21.031
Maybe that's a virtue,
maybe and I can never tell

33:21.066 --> 33:22.857
if you're actually
recommending books to me

33:22.892 --> 33:24.595
or if you're just
advertising the fact

33:24.630 --> 33:26.597
that you've read them.

33:26.632 --> 33:27.994
That's not a virtue.

33:28.029 --> 33:30.700
- I am trying to bring my
reading to bear on my life.

33:30.735 --> 33:33.505
- It's just you have this
thing, that death thing

33:34.706 --> 33:35.969
and I'm not sure
if it's something,

33:36.004 --> 33:37.179
that actually weighs on you

33:37.214 --> 33:40.050
or if it's something
you like aspire to,

33:40.085 --> 33:42.811
instead of worrying about
what to wear to auditions.

33:45.013 --> 33:46.320
It's all the same pitch lately.

33:46.355 --> 33:48.058
- Well, excuse me for
still having to audition.

33:48.093 --> 33:50.060
- I have to audition, I had
an audition the other day.

33:50.095 --> 33:51.787
- Well then, excuse
me for having to worry

33:51.822 --> 33:53.063
about what to wear,

33:53.098 --> 33:54.592
people don't just send
me clothes for free.

33:54.627 --> 33:57.925
- Hm, trained people aren't
the only ones you envy.

33:57.960 --> 34:01.038
- Why do we keep meeting?
- Because we like each other.

34:02.701 --> 34:03.601
You want?
- Hm-hm.

34:03.636 --> 34:05.834
- Don't worry, I'm buying.

34:07.541 --> 34:09.112
I need to tell you
about this audition,

34:09.147 --> 34:11.114
I think you'll appreciate
it, I know you will.

34:11.149 --> 34:13.281
Who was it for?

34:13.316 --> 34:16.053
- I don't know, even my
agent doesn't know about it.

34:17.518 --> 34:19.254
Last week a messenger dropped
a package off at my house.

34:19.289 --> 34:21.091
A messenger?

34:21.126 --> 34:22.917
- It was a thin envelope,
no return address,

34:22.952 --> 34:24.160
just my name on the front.

34:24.195 --> 34:26.360
Inside there were a few
pages from a script,

34:26.395 --> 34:28.725
three or four, a monologue.

34:28.760 --> 34:30.925
My character's
name was Katerina.

34:30.960 --> 34:31.860
- Sounds Spanish.

34:31.895 --> 34:33.928
- She wasn't, Stephanie, focus.

34:33.963 --> 34:36.766
These were the three most
exquisite pages I've ever read,

34:36.801 --> 34:38.064
script wise.

34:38.099 --> 34:40.176
- Really, what was the story?

34:40.211 --> 34:43.036
- It wasn't about the
story and I have no idea

34:43.071 --> 34:46.116
what the story was, it
was about the words.

34:46.151 --> 34:50.912
It was, it wasn't just
dialogue, it was incantation,

34:52.113 --> 34:53.486
like this Katerina
was a high priestess

34:53.521 --> 34:55.422
at some sort of black mass,

34:56.590 --> 34:59.888
only better, less, I
don't know, problematic.

34:59.923 --> 35:01.263
I mean, she was
simply saying things

35:01.298 --> 35:03.133
that had never been said before,

35:03.168 --> 35:05.894
she was bringing something
new into existence.

35:05.929 --> 35:07.665
She was calling some shit down.

35:07.700 --> 35:09.337
- You don't still
have the script?

35:11.407 --> 35:14.276
- Hold on, so I'm reading
this totally superb text

35:14.311 --> 35:17.037
and when I get to the end,
there's no writer's credit,

35:18.139 --> 35:20.073
no personalized,
little director's note,

35:20.108 --> 35:22.185
just an address
and a date and time

35:22.220 --> 35:24.187
typed dead center on the page.
- Where was the address?

35:24.222 --> 35:26.288
- Deep Brooklyn somewhere,
it doesn't matter,

35:26.323 --> 35:28.158
what was clear was that
I was being summoned

35:28.193 --> 35:31.051
and after what I've read,
believe me, I was flattered.

35:32.395 --> 35:35.594
So for the next two days I
dug in, sunk into the words,

35:35.629 --> 35:38.762
did whatever I did to
internalize this Katerina,

35:38.797 --> 35:41.303
such as she was and
at the appointed time,

35:41.338 --> 35:43.173
I took a car to the address.
- What was the street?

35:43.208 --> 35:45.703
- I'm telling you,
I can't remember,

35:45.738 --> 35:47.903
it was a warehouse
near the water,

35:47.938 --> 35:50.136
the kind of place people
go to be killed really,

35:50.171 --> 35:51.214
but I had no apprehensions,

35:51.249 --> 35:53.249
because I knew I
was gonna nail it.

35:53.284 --> 35:57.143
I mean, I had it down, I
was truly prepared to crush.

35:57.178 --> 36:01.521
The car drops me off, pulls
away, I go and knock on the door

36:01.556 --> 36:04.227
and this little, tweaky guy
answers, he's wearing a T-shirt,

36:04.262 --> 36:05.921
he seems kind of fucked up,

36:05.956 --> 36:08.154
like he's waiting
for his connection.

36:08.189 --> 36:10.266
But he recognizes
me and motions me in

36:10.301 --> 36:12.301
down this long hallway

36:13.436 --> 36:15.469
and then I start to
worry a little bit,

36:15.504 --> 36:19.242
there's all this ominous water
dripping from the rafters.

36:19.277 --> 36:20.672
- How did the messenger know

36:20.707 --> 36:22.278
how to find your house
in the first place?

36:22.313 --> 36:24.445
- Finally we stop outside
of this big, steel door,

36:24.480 --> 36:26.942
somewhere in the
depths of this place

36:26.977 --> 36:29.846
and the kid turns to me and
there's something in his eyes

36:29.881 --> 36:31.650
and suddenly he's not
so tweaky anymore,

36:31.685 --> 36:34.620
he's almost commanding,
he holds out his hands

36:34.655 --> 36:36.853
and he tells me in a
sort of clipped voice

36:36.888 --> 36:38.184
to hand over the script,

36:38.219 --> 36:39.493
which I do like I'm
in a fucking trance

36:39.528 --> 36:42.232
and he pulls out some
matches, lights it on fire,

36:42.267 --> 36:44.267
holds it up in front of me,

36:44.302 --> 36:45.400
I can see the words
burning off the page

36:45.435 --> 36:47.061
and it was only a
matter of seconds

36:47.096 --> 36:50.471
before the whole thing
is just a pile of ash.

36:50.506 --> 36:52.605
He slides open the
door and motions me in

36:52.640 --> 36:57.280
and as it closes behind me,
I realize it's all gone.

36:57.315 --> 36:59.645
- What?
- Everything, Katerina,

36:59.680 --> 37:02.681
everything I've been working
on for the past two days,

37:02.716 --> 37:04.518
poof, gone up in smoke.

37:04.553 --> 37:05.849
- I don't believe you.

37:05.884 --> 37:07.422
- Oh, I'm casting
about like crazy,

37:07.457 --> 37:09.919
I mean, there's nothing.

37:09.954 --> 37:12.295
I'm so panicked that for
a second, I can't even see

37:12.330 --> 37:14.462
what's in front of me.
- Which is what?

37:20.261 --> 37:23.669
- I'm telling you, at first I
thought they were mannequins.

37:23.704 --> 37:26.639
When I finally got my
bearings and greeted them,

37:26.674 --> 37:28.344
introduced myself like an idiot,

37:29.776 --> 37:32.711
one of them nodded slowly
as if to say proceed

37:34.143 --> 37:36.352
and I'm not even sure
what sex they were.

37:36.387 --> 37:38.717
Are you
sure they could see you?

37:40.281 --> 37:43.249
- I'm not sure of anything
other than in that moment,

37:43.284 --> 37:44.987
I knew I was gonna
disappoint them,

37:46.122 --> 37:47.660
I mean, they'd chosen me

37:49.290 --> 37:51.895
and I was gonna show them
they'd chosen poorly.

37:51.930 --> 37:53.732
Anonymous,
bescarved people.

37:53.767 --> 37:55.965
- And then suddenly
it occurred to me

37:56.000 --> 37:58.165
I was never gonna
leave that room,

37:58.200 --> 37:59.342
not because I was afraid

37:59.377 --> 38:01.839
they were gonna
hurt me or anything,

38:01.874 --> 38:04.941
but because there wasn't
any place to go outside.

38:04.976 --> 38:09.979
The world had dissolved
around us, not dissolved, no,

38:11.279 --> 38:13.213
died the moment the tweaky
boy had shut the door

38:15.426 --> 38:17.888
and this was it now
and this was the world,

38:17.923 --> 38:19.329
this room, these people in it.

38:21.399 --> 38:24.290
I felt this deeply and
I knew it was the case.

38:24.325 --> 38:26.160
Instead of warning you all

38:26.195 --> 38:29.163
or being bummed out
about everything,

38:30.408 --> 38:33.343
an incredible feeling
of relief descended

38:35.578 --> 38:38.447
and suddenly the stakes
just felt so low.

38:42.420 --> 38:45.916
Then Katerina reemerged,

38:45.951 --> 38:47.951
just a trickle at first,

38:49.394 --> 38:51.361
then came the flood
and pretty soon,

38:51.396 --> 38:53.429
she was just pouring out of me.

39:27.960 --> 39:32.292
And the moment I finished, it
was all gone again forever.

39:33.471 --> 39:35.196
- And did you get a call back?

39:37.706 --> 39:39.970
- There isn't gonna
be any call backs.

39:42.711 --> 39:44.810
- Excuse me, I don't
mean to alarm you guys,

39:44.845 --> 39:47.384
but we have just had a
bomb threat called in.

39:48.618 --> 39:50.651
- Was it a young woman,
the voice on the phone?

39:50.686 --> 39:51.454
- Yeah.

39:51.489 --> 39:52.422
- We're fine.

39:53.854 --> 39:56.283
- I think the police are
gonna come and make you leave.

39:56.318 --> 39:58.824
- Well, we'll wait for them,
I'd like to finish my drink.

40:25.523 --> 40:28.381
- Well, hello, sir, nice suit.

40:28.416 --> 40:30.251
- You didn't say it was a party.

40:30.286 --> 40:31.956
- Would you have come if I had?

40:33.663 --> 40:35.861
- You know, people used
to dance at parties.

40:35.896 --> 40:37.390
- So I'll get a
cotillion going for you.

40:37.425 --> 40:39.029
What would you like to drink?

40:40.571 --> 40:44.199
- Oh, it's been a hard day.

40:44.234 --> 40:45.805
- What, did we kill some kids

40:45.840 --> 40:47.510
in a drone strike or something?

40:47.545 --> 40:49.446
- No, it's personal.

40:52.176 --> 40:55.342
Oh, Jesus, what the
hell's he doing here?

40:55.377 --> 40:56.816
- If the schools didn't
have so much money,

40:56.851 --> 40:58.147
we'd have the resources we need

40:58.182 --> 40:59.445
to really fucking
deal with this.

40:59.480 --> 41:01.788
- You know someone?
- But as it is now, you know.

41:03.055 --> 41:05.121
Gerard!
- He's one of those JTTF,

41:05.156 --> 41:06.859
horrible guys, the worst one.

41:09.094 --> 41:10.027
Who invited him?
- I don't know.

41:10.062 --> 41:11.259
- Give me her name.

41:11.294 --> 41:13.030
- He said his name was Max.

41:13.065 --> 41:14.537
- Well, it isn't.

41:14.572 --> 41:16.429
- Hey, buddy, what a surprise.
- Your name isn't Max.

41:16.464 --> 41:17.463
- Yeah, it is.

41:17.498 --> 41:19.432
What
are you doing here?

41:19.467 --> 41:22.237
- Gerard, there are
people in the world,

41:22.272 --> 41:25.515
who go out in the evening
and live their lives

41:25.550 --> 41:28.078
like people in a world.

41:28.113 --> 41:29.981
Why the fuck are
you wearing a suit?

41:30.016 --> 41:31.345
- You little, deputized-

41:31.380 --> 41:32.478
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Piece of-

41:32.513 --> 41:34.381
- Whatever, whatever,
it's good to see you.

41:34.416 --> 41:36.493
How did you two meet?
- On the street.

41:37.958 --> 41:40.530
- I dig the street, nice,
who approached first?

41:40.565 --> 41:41.531
- He did.

41:41.566 --> 41:43.599
- Not true entirely.

41:43.634 --> 41:46.096
- Nice, Gerard, nice.

41:46.131 --> 41:48.362
That's the New York
City I grew up in,

41:48.397 --> 41:52.575
people approaching each
other, speaking to each other,

41:52.610 --> 41:55.006
having a drink and then,
boom!

41:56.372 --> 41:58.339
Sorry if that makes me
sound like an old man.

41:58.374 --> 42:00.473
- No.
- Hey, don't like him.

42:00.508 --> 42:02.981
- Don't worry, she's not
gonna like me, I can tell.

42:03.016 --> 42:05.412
I'm not one of those
guys who goes around

42:05.447 --> 42:07.117
saying I'm not here
to make friends,

42:07.152 --> 42:09.482
which is pretty much
Gerard's refrain at work.

42:09.517 --> 42:10.824
- Oh yeah, work,

42:10.859 --> 42:13.486
like you're some kind
of insurance salesman.

42:13.521 --> 42:16.797
- Yeah, it's correlative
of what I do.

42:17.998 --> 42:20.196
Hey, have you met the
lovely Lysette yet?

42:20.231 --> 42:21.571
- Okay, excuse us.

42:26.644 --> 42:29.579
Did you
invite that guy, Max?

42:50.591 --> 42:53.636
- Hey, are you pregnant?
- Look, I told you-

42:53.671 --> 42:55.132
- Yes.
- Is this,

42:55.167 --> 42:58.036
this is proof, isn't it?
- It is proof.

42:58.071 --> 42:59.807
- Can I call you a
hillbilly, is that the same?

42:59.842 --> 43:02.370
- You can call me a hillbilly.
- Is that the same shit?

43:02.405 --> 43:03.536
- Please do call me a hillbilly.

43:03.571 --> 43:06.341
- What are you then?
- I'm a real person.

43:06.376 --> 43:08.508
So what would I be
according to you?

43:09.654 --> 43:10.620
- A prophesy.

43:12.657 --> 43:16.483
- I don't know, man, I don't
bring this shit around,

43:16.518 --> 43:19.354
I just wanna know what it is.

43:19.389 --> 43:20.696
- Motherfucker!

43:21.699 --> 43:24.491
- Dude.
- Hack motherfucker!

43:24.526 --> 43:26.493
- Relax, man, you know we're
both here just to break off

43:26.528 --> 43:27.670
a piece of boho strains.
- No, no, no.

43:27.705 --> 43:29.199
- Come on, relax, man.
- No, you listen to me.

43:29.234 --> 43:30.640
- We don't have a problem.
- Listen,

43:30.675 --> 43:33.566
let's talk about May 2013.
- Oh, words, words, words.

43:33.601 --> 43:35.568
- And your immense fuck up.

43:35.603 --> 43:37.845
You guys are so fucking
stupid, you don't,

43:37.880 --> 43:39.781
I don't even know
how you can live.

43:39.816 --> 43:41.310
- Gerard's pussy-
- Oh, you know exactly

43:41.345 --> 43:43.246
what I'm talking about.
- Didn't file his forms

43:43.281 --> 43:44.654
correctly this morning.
- What is your problem?

43:44.689 --> 43:46.084
- You fucking-
- Hey.

43:48.693 --> 43:50.187
- I think we should end it.

43:50.222 --> 43:51.925
End what?

43:53.830 --> 43:54.631
- This charade.

43:55.656 --> 43:58.492
No reason to end it.

43:58.527 --> 44:00.835
See, I've developed a
kind of affection for you.

44:01.904 --> 44:03.640
- Stop it.
- No, but really.

44:05.776 --> 44:07.908
What was it
that happened today,

44:07.943 --> 44:09.470
that was so personal?

44:09.505 --> 44:11.714
Not your business.

44:13.344 --> 44:16.576
- Roger, Max, they
both suit him.

44:17.887 --> 44:20.723
Well, like I
said, Roger's the real one.

44:20.758 --> 44:21.658
- It suits him.

44:23.519 --> 44:24.320
Is it Lysette?

44:25.994 --> 44:28.621
- I'm not comfortable
with you saying her name.

44:28.656 --> 44:31.492
- Look, you've made me
this weird, little nexus

44:31.527 --> 44:33.703
for your interpersonal
professional problems

44:33.738 --> 44:36.464
and I know where this place is
now and I can find it again,

44:36.499 --> 44:37.806
so you might as well tell me.

44:40.910 --> 44:43.944
I want you to
stop being interested in me.

44:43.979 --> 44:46.375
That's
not your choice.

44:48.313 --> 44:49.719
It's Lysette, right?

44:49.754 --> 44:52.546
Where did you two meet anyway?

44:52.581 --> 44:53.822
Has she been here?

44:57.091 --> 44:58.794
Do you take other women here?

45:00.765 --> 45:02.655
I'm not sure if I should
feel honored or what,

45:02.690 --> 45:04.800
no, I know I shouldn't
feel honored.

45:04.835 --> 45:06.769
I'll admit I'm flattered,
but Jesus, Gerard,

45:06.804 --> 45:07.770
what did you think?

45:07.805 --> 45:11.136
Your work is despicable,
you're despicable.

45:11.171 --> 45:14.172
I mean, yeah, from what I can
glean, you're not a catch,

45:14.207 --> 45:18.176
long hours, behavior, what
did you expect, loyalty?

45:18.211 --> 45:20.409
Where did you two meet anyway?

45:24.415 --> 45:25.216
Okay.

45:27.792 --> 45:30.683
Well, my advice is that
you take her out for dinner

45:30.718 --> 45:33.323
tomorrow, that's
how easy it can be.

45:33.358 --> 45:36.161
There's nothing better
than someone taking you out

45:36.196 --> 45:38.592
for dinner, when it's a nice
surprise, somewhere elegant,

45:38.627 --> 45:41.837
not too much, like a nice,
high end barbecue joint

45:41.872 --> 45:43.696
or good tacos or something.

45:43.731 --> 45:47.139
A good dinner can really
seal the deal, seriously,

45:47.174 --> 45:50.175
a lot can be forgiven, if
you have the right ambience,

45:50.210 --> 45:51.704
good wine and if you're present,

45:51.739 --> 45:53.849
you just have to be present.

45:53.884 --> 45:58.744
Oh, and ah, mindful, don't
forget that, mindful and present

45:58.779 --> 46:01.857
and low camp lights and some
shit hanging from the rafters,

46:01.892 --> 46:03.925
then you're golden.

46:03.960 --> 46:05.256
Get out.

46:05.291 --> 46:07.654
- Oh, you wanna
go? Come on, man.

46:07.689 --> 46:09.326
- Get out.

46:09.361 --> 46:10.558
Please.

46:10.593 --> 46:12.263
- Oh, please, where
am I gonna go?

46:13.838 --> 46:17.840
- Why won't you ever shut
up?

46:17.875 --> 46:20.843
You fucker!

46:20.878 --> 46:22.735
Ah!

46:22.770 --> 46:24.572
- Ow!

46:24.607 --> 46:26.882
- Jesus, shit, Jesus Christ.

46:28.853 --> 46:29.643
Gerard.

46:31.086 --> 46:32.987
Hey, hey, shit.

46:34.892 --> 46:36.221
Um, think.

46:44.264 --> 46:45.032
Hello.

46:45.067 --> 46:45.835
Hello.

46:45.870 --> 46:46.836
- Who is this?

46:46.871 --> 46:47.661
Who is this?

46:49.940 --> 46:52.204
- There's been an accident.

46:52.239 --> 46:54.107
- Who am I speaking to?
- There's a man bleeding here

46:54.142 --> 46:56.043
and I think he's
in serious trouble.

46:57.211 --> 46:58.848
- Which man?
- Gerard is his name.

46:58.883 --> 47:01.510
I see, what
kind of trouble?

47:01.545 --> 47:03.017
- Oh, he fell, he hit his head,

47:03.052 --> 47:05.085
he's bleeding and
he can't speak.

47:05.120 --> 47:07.417
- Oh, that sounds pretty bad.

47:07.452 --> 47:09.023
- I think you
should send someone.

47:09.058 --> 47:11.927
Right, and
you are who again?

47:11.962 --> 47:12.994
Strange-
- Don't worry about me,

47:13.029 --> 47:14.589
just send someone.

47:14.624 --> 47:17.097
You stay there,
you stay right where you-

47:26.570 --> 47:28.977
Okay, are you ready?

47:30.046 --> 47:31.881
Remember it's not
the final version.

47:58.701 --> 48:02.241
in deep distress

48:09.910 --> 48:14.385
someone her age

48:14.420 --> 48:17.993
no, you hate him

48:22.362 --> 48:25.759
about cruelty

48:34.935 --> 48:39.707
the bond, oh, no

49:01.599 --> 49:04.930
off both her ears

49:04.965 --> 49:09.902
sand and walked away

49:13.215 --> 49:17.547
said to weigh

49:17.582 --> 49:20.946
of pure beauty

49:20.981 --> 49:25.522
by those who see

49:35.633 --> 49:39.767
the bond, oh no

50:25.012 --> 50:27.287
- This is your guitar, right?

50:27.322 --> 50:29.014
- Yeah, you like that one?

50:29.049 --> 50:31.456
- Yeah, what is
the aluminum piece?

50:31.491 --> 50:33.293
- Ah, it's a buzzing bridge,

50:33.328 --> 50:35.493
it's what gives it that overtone

50:36.628 --> 50:37.462
and undertone.

50:39.334 --> 50:40.597
- Cool.

50:40.632 --> 50:43.039
- Yeah, there's a
Indian word for it,

50:44.141 --> 50:45.965
but I can't remember.

50:59.123 --> 51:01.783
- I understand, I'd
probably quit too.

51:06.130 --> 51:07.789
- Well, I didn't quit yet.

51:09.133 --> 51:14.070
- Yeah, I don't know how I'll
do in nursing school, but.

51:14.930 --> 51:16.699
- Did you play it?

51:16.734 --> 51:18.074
- No, I didn't.

51:19.704 --> 51:22.111
- So you went to
their house and cried

51:22.146 --> 51:24.212
like in front of them or?

51:26.106 --> 51:30.152
- I'm not gonna attack you
tonight.

51:30.187 --> 51:33.089
It took me a long time to work
up the courage to say that.

51:35.016 --> 51:38.589
So I saw your Larkin
book, I love him.

51:38.624 --> 51:40.327
So bleak.

51:41.891 --> 51:44.958
A little crab for my taste,
I prefer the ecstatic poets

51:44.993 --> 51:47.730
like Whitman,
mostly Blake though,

51:47.765 --> 51:50.172
Blake was my man in college,

51:50.207 --> 51:52.735
always had Blake at
the ready, you know.

51:52.770 --> 51:56.068
Those fucking illustrations,
you know he did those?

51:56.103 --> 51:57.179
- Hm-mm.

51:57.214 --> 51:57.980
- Yeah.

51:59.139 --> 52:01.040
Anyway, look,
you're gonna be fine

52:02.142 --> 52:04.186
and I know when we leave here,

52:04.221 --> 52:06.155
we're not ever gonna
see each other again,

52:06.190 --> 52:07.750
I'm not naive about that shit.

52:08.951 --> 52:11.424
I just want you to know that

52:11.459 --> 52:13.888
I'm already wishing that
we were a bigger part

52:13.923 --> 52:16.429
of each other's lives, not
that we are now, but...

52:18.125 --> 52:20.829
So in the fucking future, when
we'll never see each other,

52:20.864 --> 52:22.402
I'll be thinking of you

52:24.868 --> 52:26.439
and just wishing you well.

52:28.773 --> 52:30.542
'Cause I've been watching you

52:31.743 --> 52:34.249
and I'm just gonna miss that.

52:37.485 --> 52:38.814
But my guess is

52:40.257 --> 52:43.621
you're not gonna be
thinking about me at all.

52:48.232 --> 52:50.496
- I should go back
to the city tomorrow.

53:02.070 --> 53:03.311
- Who's ready?
- Right.

53:04.281 --> 53:05.577
- Dylan's ready.

53:08.175 --> 53:10.879
- Oh, my God, oh, God.
- Oh, that's too-

53:10.914 --> 53:12.254
- Yep, ah-huh.

53:12.289 --> 53:14.421
- You all take it.
- Soft and rookie.

53:14.456 --> 53:16.555
- I'll take one.

53:16.590 --> 53:19.294
- It's not easy to pour.

53:19.329 --> 53:21.021
- That is so funny.
- Come on.

53:21.056 --> 53:22.594
- Taste that.
- Drink.

53:22.629 --> 53:24.398
- That's kind of a generosity.
- That tastes good.

53:24.433 --> 53:26.994
You both
pour with his generosity.

53:27.029 --> 53:28.864
It's not
that you could ruin mixing

53:28.899 --> 53:31.306
and make some kind of
sophisticated thing with it.

53:32.474 --> 53:34.243
- Go ahead, have the last bit.
- Alright.

53:34.278 --> 53:36.311
- Can I have a cigarette?
- Go for it.

53:36.346 --> 53:39.039
I'm
willing to share my chaser.

53:39.074 --> 53:41.316
- You gotta put the bottom up.
- Ah!

53:41.351 --> 53:43.175
- It's up.
- Yeah.

53:43.210 --> 53:44.220
- Whoo!

53:45.751 --> 53:47.256
That's disgusting.

53:49.150 --> 53:50.886
- But now you're one of us.
- Aw!

53:50.921 --> 53:54.021
Does anyone
have a cigarette I can bum?

53:54.056 --> 53:55.858
- Sure.
- Bong, bong, bong, bong.

53:55.893 --> 53:59.191
- Sorry.
- Now don't be sorry please.

53:59.226 --> 54:00.269
- More?
- Help yourself, right.

54:00.304 --> 54:01.732
- We like that stuff.
- Really?

54:01.767 --> 54:03.668
- Yeah, we do.

54:03.703 --> 54:05.340
We found a sucker.

54:07.267 --> 54:09.201
Ah, here you are.

54:09.236 --> 54:11.643
Wish we
had the bongos in here.

54:13.240 --> 54:15.647
- How about you, a
shot, another shot?

54:15.682 --> 54:16.549
- I'm good.

54:16.584 --> 54:18.716
- Come on.
- No.

54:20.456 --> 54:22.291
- Leave her alone, Jim.

55:13.234 --> 55:15.509
Careful now.

55:17.744 --> 55:21.383
Stop, stop, stop,
stop, stop, stop, stop.

55:27.424 --> 55:32.427
You didn't tell me she could
sing, I mean.

55:33.430 --> 55:34.220
Wow.

56:08.432 --> 56:10.190
Hey!

56:10.225 --> 56:11.026
- Hey!

56:13.162 --> 56:14.931
I didn't wanna wake you.

56:14.966 --> 56:15.866
- You didn't.

56:21.874 --> 56:22.774
- Thanks.

56:24.206 --> 56:25.447
- I didn't do anything.

56:27.484 --> 56:28.516
Good luck.

57:28.435 --> 57:29.676
Sorry,

57:30.910 --> 57:33.405
I don't even know if I'm
in the right apartment.

57:33.440 --> 57:36.375
- For what?
- For a, I, um.

57:37.444 --> 57:39.950
Did you, do you work for Gerard?

57:44.451 --> 57:46.528
Well, I understand we
have to be discreet,

57:46.563 --> 57:48.893
but I wanted to make sure-
- Gerard?

57:48.928 --> 57:52.160
Yes, the
last time we were here,

57:52.195 --> 57:56.032
he, we had an altercation,

57:56.067 --> 57:59.233
he was hurt badly and
I wanted to see if-

57:59.268 --> 58:00.608
- He's dead.

58:02.469 --> 58:03.743
I mean, probably,

58:03.778 --> 58:05.470
hurt badly is almost always
a euphemism, isn't it?

58:05.505 --> 58:08.176
It's what you tell a kid
about a car accident,

58:08.211 --> 58:10.849
Daddy was hurt badly and
now he's with the angels.

58:10.884 --> 58:12.554
What do I know though,
I'm just a realtor.

58:12.589 --> 58:14.116
You shouldn't be here.
- Wait, he's not-

58:14.151 --> 58:16.855
- We're not officially
showing until tomorrow,

58:16.890 --> 58:20.859
but since you came all
this way, white wine?

58:20.894 --> 58:22.091
No.

58:26.526 --> 58:29.802
- Are you sure? It's a good
one, it's dry minerally.

58:29.837 --> 58:31.870
I'll drink it with beef,
I don't give a shit.

58:31.905 --> 58:35.401
You say you've been in this
apartment before with er?

58:35.436 --> 58:37.711
- He used to work here.
- Gerard was his name.

58:37.746 --> 58:39.471
- Look, I get wanting
to mess with me.

58:39.506 --> 58:41.506
- Whoa, the last thing I'd do

58:41.541 --> 58:43.277
would be alienating
a potential buyer,

58:43.312 --> 58:44.817
but I'm not sure
that's what you are,

58:44.852 --> 58:46.313
you look like you rent.

58:46.348 --> 58:47.820
Do you have a car?

58:47.855 --> 58:50.152
There's nothing within
walking distance.

58:50.187 --> 58:52.484
This isn't even
technically a neighborhood,

58:52.519 --> 58:54.387
between you and me, I
wouldn't actually live here,

58:54.422 --> 58:56.631
for the time being, but
let some other poor sucker

58:56.666 --> 58:58.391
be the one to sit in the desert

58:58.426 --> 59:00.525
and wait for the
yoga shop to open.

59:00.560 --> 59:02.362
Maybe throw down a
mattress somewhere

59:02.397 --> 59:04.232
for the occasional,
sad, little assignation,

59:04.267 --> 59:07.136
but that's only if you're too
cheap to get a hotel room.

59:07.171 --> 59:08.775
- Look, I didn't
even like the guy.

59:08.810 --> 59:10.139
- He shouldn't have
been working here,

59:10.174 --> 59:12.504
this place is not zoned
for commercial use.

59:12.539 --> 59:13.681
- What's your name?

59:14.618 --> 59:15.914
Is it Lysette?

59:15.949 --> 59:18.312
Do you have a card?
- Didn't bring them.

59:18.347 --> 59:20.754
We're not showing until
tomorrow like I said.

59:20.789 --> 59:23.119
You shouldn't be here.

59:23.154 --> 59:24.725
At any rate, all trace
of former occupants

59:24.760 --> 59:26.551
has been completely eradicated,

59:26.586 --> 59:29.994
the management company was
very clear, clean slate.

59:30.898 --> 59:34.636
Altercation,

59:34.671 --> 59:37.639
Christ, why can't you people
just say what you mean.

59:37.674 --> 59:39.465
Must have really fucked him up.

59:40.677 --> 59:43.777
- Look, I just need
to know if he's alive,

59:43.812 --> 59:45.812
or sentient, he hit his head.

59:45.847 --> 59:48.540
You do understand why
I need to know this?

59:48.575 --> 59:52.313
- Seems to me all you need
to know is whether he's gone

59:53.217 --> 59:54.722
and from where I'm standing,

59:57.584 --> 1:00:00.728
I can basically assure
you that's the case.

1:00:01.698 --> 1:00:02.664
Anything else?

1:00:03.623 --> 1:00:05.590
- I'll find out
from somewhere else,

1:00:05.625 --> 1:00:08.736
there's records somewhere,
there's, there's Lysette.

1:00:09.673 --> 1:00:11.299
Never heard of her.

1:00:12.137 --> 1:00:14.599
Look, I'm a practical person,

1:00:14.634 --> 1:00:16.106
I'm just here to show the space.

1:00:16.141 --> 1:00:18.306
It's up to the buyer
to make it a home.

1:00:18.341 --> 1:00:20.209
- Stop it, come on, please.

1:00:23.280 --> 1:00:24.576
What?

1:00:24.611 --> 1:00:25.885
- I said this conversation
could be giving you

1:00:25.920 --> 1:00:28.415
so much solace, if
only you'd let it.

1:00:32.729 --> 1:00:35.026
They must've decided
to do a walkthrough.

1:00:36.227 --> 1:00:37.897
You have to go.

1:00:37.932 --> 1:00:39.129
I'll be back.

1:00:40.660 --> 1:00:42.264
- What if I won't?

1:00:42.299 --> 1:00:43.969
- I could lose my job.

1:00:51.748 --> 1:00:53.781
- There's nothing
more you'll tell me?

1:01:03.485 --> 1:01:05.089
- You're going to be just fine.

1:01:23.406 --> 1:01:25.307
- Hm-mm, yes, I'm here.

1:01:26.706 --> 1:01:27.507
Hm-mm.

1:01:28.312 --> 1:01:29.113
Good.

1:01:41.798 --> 1:01:42.621
Hi.

1:01:43.558 --> 1:01:44.766
- Hello.

1:01:44.801 --> 1:01:46.658
Olena, you
said it was, right?

1:01:46.693 --> 1:01:47.802
- Olena.

1:01:47.837 --> 1:01:50.299
- Hey there, look what's on.

1:01:50.334 --> 1:01:51.740
- Oh, God.

1:01:53.700 --> 1:01:56.701
This must be the uninteresting
failures channel.

1:01:56.736 --> 1:02:00.177
- I think it's good.

1:02:00.212 --> 1:02:03.114
- That was a long time
ago, I can do better.

1:02:03.149 --> 1:02:06.711
- You're always good, what
time's your call tomorrow?

1:02:06.746 --> 1:02:09.758
- 6:30, but I still have
some lines to go over.

1:02:09.793 --> 1:02:12.992
I got some charcuterie,
you want some sopas set?

1:02:13.027 --> 1:02:14.554
- Oh, shit,

1:02:14.589 --> 1:02:16.589
that's Elsa and her dad, I
slept longer than I wanted to.

1:02:16.624 --> 1:02:19.295
Charcuterie in 20, no bread.

1:02:19.330 --> 1:02:20.593
Hi.

1:02:20.628 --> 1:02:22.232
- Hello.

1:02:22.267 --> 1:02:23.530
- Hi.

1:02:23.565 --> 1:02:26.401
- Hi, baby, hi, Michael.

1:02:26.436 --> 1:02:28.337
- We tried you earlier,
not much time though,

1:02:28.372 --> 1:02:29.811
she's gotta get to bed.

1:02:29.846 --> 1:02:31.978
- I know, I'm sorry,
I fell asleep.

1:02:32.013 --> 1:02:35.179
I'm so exhausted, this
film is frankly killing me.

1:02:35.214 --> 1:02:36.411
- Sorry to hear it.

1:02:39.350 --> 1:02:41.713
- I saw you on TV last night.

1:02:41.748 --> 1:02:43.517
- Oh, you did?
- Hm-mm.

1:02:43.552 --> 1:02:44.859
- What was I doing?

1:02:44.894 --> 1:02:46.927
- Ah, shooting somebody.

1:02:46.962 --> 1:02:50.458
- Oh, dear, well, your dad
shouldn't have let you see that.

1:02:50.493 --> 1:02:52.757
It was the sitter.
- May I have a story?

1:02:52.792 --> 1:02:55.133
- She can't hear you.
- May I have a story?

1:02:55.168 --> 1:02:57.267
- Of course, what
would you like to hear?

1:02:57.302 --> 1:02:58.103
- Spooky.

1:02:58.908 --> 1:03:01.403
- Oh, okay, spooky.

1:03:01.438 --> 1:03:05.946
Okay, what about
spooky and sweet,

1:03:05.981 --> 1:03:07.849
like spooky with a good ending?

1:03:08.775 --> 1:03:10.181
Yeah?
- Hm-mm.

1:03:10.216 --> 1:03:12.612
- Great, okay, now make
sure you close your eyes,

1:03:12.647 --> 1:03:15.285
so you can see what I'm saying,

1:03:15.320 --> 1:03:16.924
really feel the pictures, okay?

1:03:17.927 --> 1:03:19.026
Okay, good.

1:03:21.898 --> 1:03:26.362
Okay, so there was once a
young girl, no, a young boy.

1:03:26.397 --> 1:03:28.628
- Does it have to
be about a kid?

1:03:28.663 --> 1:03:30.905
- I'm making a
fairytale, Michael,

1:03:30.940 --> 1:03:33.204
let me do my thing,
let me riff, Christ.

1:03:34.141 --> 1:03:37.472
Okay, so this young boy,

1:03:37.507 --> 1:03:41.476
he had a pig,

1:03:41.511 --> 1:03:44.776
he lived on a farm, you see
and he had lots of animals,

1:03:44.811 --> 1:03:48.120
cows and chickens,
all the farm animals,

1:03:48.155 --> 1:03:52.190
but the pig was his best
friend, since he was a piglet.

1:03:52.225 --> 1:03:54.390
He and the boy had
a special bond,

1:03:54.425 --> 1:03:56.722
the pig followed
the boy everywhere

1:03:56.757 --> 1:04:01.760
and the boy's parents, the
farmer and the farm, farm wife,

1:04:03.071 --> 1:04:05.830
they promised never to
make food out of the pig,

1:04:05.865 --> 1:04:08.503
they would let him keep the
pig always and you know what,

1:04:08.538 --> 1:04:11.880
they even let him sleep
with the pig in bed.

1:04:11.915 --> 1:04:15.312
Yes, and he didn't
even care when the pig,

1:04:15.347 --> 1:04:18.513
whose name was Bertram,

1:04:19.681 --> 1:04:22.957
he didn't care when
Bertram got big and fat,

1:04:22.992 --> 1:04:24.552
they still slept together

1:04:24.587 --> 1:04:26.895
and held each other tight
through the whole night.

1:04:27.997 --> 1:04:29.128
But then one day,

1:04:33.398 --> 1:04:37.499
then one day, the boy woke up

1:04:37.534 --> 1:04:41.943
and Bertram was giving him this
look that was very serious.

1:04:41.978 --> 1:04:44.044
It was a look that Bertram
had never given him before

1:04:44.079 --> 1:04:46.706
and the boy was worried

1:04:47.874 --> 1:04:52.712
and then the pig opened
his mouth and said,

1:04:52.747 --> 1:04:55.955
"There's something
bad in the forest."

1:04:59.028 --> 1:05:01.688
But before the boy could
ask him what it was,

1:05:01.723 --> 1:05:03.591
the pig hopped out
of bed and motioned

1:05:03.626 --> 1:05:07.463
with his little pig foot
for the boy to follow.

1:05:07.498 --> 1:05:09.861
The boy creeped down the stairs

1:05:09.896 --> 1:05:14.668
and followed Bertram
through the front door

1:05:14.703 --> 1:05:18.947
passed the cows and the
chickens and over to the fence

1:05:18.982 --> 1:05:20.982
and the tall trees beyond.

1:05:21.017 --> 1:05:24.986
The boy kept asking,
"What's in the woods, man?"

1:05:25.021 --> 1:05:27.714
And Bertram just kept
repeating the same phrase

1:05:27.749 --> 1:05:31.751
over and over,
"There's something bad,

1:05:31.786 --> 1:05:34.193
something bad in the forest."

1:05:36.065 --> 1:05:39.660
And as the boy followed Bertram
in, the boy kept asking,

1:05:41.037 --> 1:05:44.038
"Where is it, what
is it, Bertram?"

1:05:45.338 --> 1:05:49.373
And Bertram's voice only got
deeper and he just kept saying,

1:05:49.408 --> 1:05:52.376
"Further in, further in."

1:05:52.411 --> 1:05:54.983
And then they were
quiet for some time

1:05:56.250 --> 1:05:58.481
and Bertram was moving very fast

1:05:59.880 --> 1:06:02.353
and the boy couldn't
keep up with him

1:06:04.753 --> 1:06:06.995
and then finally he
said, "We're close,"

1:06:07.030 --> 1:06:09.998
and began to slow down and
as they came to a clearing,

1:06:10.033 --> 1:06:14.970
a very dark clearing with
worms and weird creepy crawlies

1:06:16.501 --> 1:06:20.635
and the bats still flying
overhead, Bertram stopped

1:06:21.968 --> 1:06:24.507
and he looked up at the boy,
who had stopped behind him

1:06:25.708 --> 1:06:30.084
and now he just seemed
like a regular old pig,

1:06:30.119 --> 1:06:32.581
something in his
eyes had changed

1:06:33.683 --> 1:06:37.256
and gotten less
intense and person-ish

1:06:37.291 --> 1:06:38.620
and the boy said,

1:06:40.063 --> 1:06:43.691
"Are we here, Bertram, is
this where the bad thing is?"

1:06:44.892 --> 1:06:47.134
But Bertram looked up
at the boy confused

1:06:48.665 --> 1:06:52.469
like he didn't know why
either of them were there,

1:06:52.504 --> 1:06:55.043
like it was the boy who had
brought him to the woods

1:06:58.609 --> 1:07:01.709
and they paused there looking
at one another for a while

1:07:03.009 --> 1:07:07.088
and it was so, so quiet,

1:07:08.685 --> 1:07:10.685
the boy thought he
could hear the worms

1:07:10.720 --> 1:07:14.722
crawling up and
out of the ground.

1:07:19.102 --> 1:07:23.863
And then Bertram turned suddenly
and began to dig very fast

1:07:23.898 --> 1:07:25.139
and the boy was surprised,

1:07:25.174 --> 1:07:27.900
because he had never
seen Bertram dig before

1:07:27.935 --> 1:07:29.935
and here he was
digging like a dog

1:07:30.773 --> 1:07:33.037
and the boy said his name,

1:07:33.072 --> 1:07:35.083
but Bertram ignored
him and kept digging,

1:07:35.118 --> 1:07:38.185
throwing dirt up
into the boy's face,

1:07:39.452 --> 1:07:43.091
frantic and intent and
before the boy knew it,

1:07:43.126 --> 1:07:45.159
Bertram was halfway underground

1:07:46.393 --> 1:07:49.955
and he said his name
again, "Bertram, Bertram."

1:07:51.299 --> 1:07:54.564
Just then, Bertram
hit something,

1:07:55.666 --> 1:07:57.864
something wet

1:07:59.703 --> 1:08:03.441
and as he did, he
spoke again finally,

1:08:03.476 --> 1:08:05.344
but the boy couldn't
hear what he said,

1:08:05.379 --> 1:08:07.313
because Bertram's
voice was muffled now

1:08:07.348 --> 1:08:10.250
and so strange and scared and-
- Stephanie.

1:08:12.518 --> 1:08:13.451
She's asleep.

1:08:13.486 --> 1:08:15.079
- Oh, yes, okay.

1:08:15.114 --> 1:08:16.586
- Probably a relief,

1:08:16.621 --> 1:08:19.259
wasn't sure where you
were going with that.

1:08:19.294 --> 1:08:20.095
- Right.

1:08:23.166 --> 1:08:25.133
So same time tomorrow?

1:08:25.168 --> 1:08:28.092
- Ah, yeah, sure, or,

1:08:28.127 --> 1:08:29.203
or Tuesday.

1:08:30.239 --> 1:08:30.996
- Great.

1:08:31.966 --> 1:08:33.174
Good.

1:08:33.209 --> 1:08:35.308
Good
luck with the movie.

1:08:35.343 --> 1:08:36.144
- Thank you.

1:08:38.005 --> 1:08:39.642
- Right, okay, till soon.

1:08:43.043 --> 1:08:44.009
- Yeah.
