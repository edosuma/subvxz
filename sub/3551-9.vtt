WEBVTT

00:00.701 --> 00:02.133
PREVIOUSLY ON...

00:02.133 --> 00:04.175
RENEE AND TOM
DISCUSSED THEIR PAST.

00:04.175 --> 00:08.309
I SEEM TO REMEMBER YOU CAUGHT ME
IN A TOWEL THEN, TOO.

00:08.309 --> 00:10.141
BREE'S THANKSGIVING DINNER...

00:10.141 --> 00:12.143
I WANT A DIVORCE!
 I'M HAPPY TO OBLIGE!

00:12.143 --> 00:14.045
DAD! MOM!

00:14.045 --> 00:16.146
WENT UP IN FLAMES.

00:16.146 --> 00:17.718
LOOK WHO'S HERE!

00:17.718 --> 00:20.451
GABY'S DINNER ENDED
WHEN HECTOR GOT ARRESTED...

00:20.451 --> 00:23.454
I THINK THEY'RE ILLEGALS.
 I HAVE TO MOVE OUT OF OUR HOUSE!

00:23.454 --> 00:27.498
AND SHE WAS AFRAID OF LOSING
HER BIOLOGICAL DAUGHTER GRACE.

00:27.498 --> 00:30.030
STAY WITH US UNTIL
WE CAN FIGURE THINGS OUT.

00:30.030 --> 00:33.304
AND PAUL'S PLAN...
 YOU ARE THE PROUD NEW OWNER
OF YOUR OLD HOUSE.

00:33.304 --> 00:36.167
WAS SET IN MOTION.

00:42.042 --> 00:45.045
SO PAIGE AND I WILL BE AT
THE PARK FOR ABOUT 30 MINUTES.

00:45.045 --> 00:48.048
GREAT. I SHOULD HAVE ALL
THE CLOTHES PACKED UP BY THEN.

00:48.048 --> 00:50.050
OH, SHOOT.
I FORGOT THE PACIFIER.

00:50.050 --> 00:53.554
I DIDN'T. IT'S IN THE DIAPER
BAG. HAVE A GOOD TIME.

00:53.554 --> 00:55.556
(Mary Alice)
THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS

00:55.556 --> 00:58.189
EVERY PARENT MUST REMEMBER--

00:58.189 --> 01:02.163
WHICH TOYS
CAN'T BE THROWN AWAY...

01:02.163 --> 01:06.066
WHICH VEGETABLES
MUST NOT BE SERVED...

01:06.066 --> 01:10.101
WHICH CLOTHES
SHOULD NEVER BE MENDED...

01:10.101 --> 01:15.276
BUT THE ONE THING
EVERY PARENT CAN FORGET...

01:15.276 --> 01:20.451
IS HOW QUICKLY
THEIR CHILDREN GROW UP.

01:20.451 --> 01:22.413
HEY.

01:22.413 --> 01:24.585
WHAT'S GOING ON
IN HERE?

01:24.585 --> 01:26.587
UH, LISA ELLISON
IS PREGNANT,

01:26.587 --> 01:29.089
SO I'M GONNA GIVE HER
SOME BABY CLOTHES.

01:29.089 --> 01:31.592
PAIGE HAS GROWN OUT
OF ALL HER ONESIES.

01:31.592 --> 01:33.093
WOW, THAT WAS FAST.

01:33.093 --> 01:36.527
SO FAST. ISN'T THERE A WAY
WE COULD KEEP HER SMALL?

01:36.527 --> 01:38.529
WELL, WE COULD
STOP FEEDING HER.

01:38.529 --> 01:40.831
THEN WE COULD SAVE MONEY
ON FOOD AND CLOTHES.

01:40.831 --> 01:42.533
OHH. (inhales)

01:42.533 --> 01:43.834
HEY, ARE YOU OKAY?

01:43.834 --> 01:46.837
YEAH, IT JUST HIT ME
THAT THIS IS MY LAST ONESIE.

01:46.837 --> 01:49.540
(voice breaking)
AFTER PAIGE, NO MORE BABIES.

01:49.540 --> 01:51.542
ISN'T THAT WHAT YOU WANTED?
 MM.

01:51.542 --> 01:53.844
I MEAN, WEREN'T YOU THE ONE
WHO THREW CONFETTI...
 (sniffles)

01:53.844 --> 01:55.846
AFTER THE DOCTOR
TIED YOUR TUBES?

01:55.846 --> 01:58.849
YES, BUT NOW I'M THINKING THAT
IT'S JUST GOING BY TOO QUICK...

01:58.849 --> 02:02.122
OHH.
 AND BEFORE YOU KNOW IT,
THEY'LL BE GROWN, AND...

02:02.122 --> 02:04.124
(sniffles)
JUST BE YOU AND ME.

02:04.124 --> 02:07.127
YEAH. YOU KNOW WHAT
THE BEST PART OF THAT IS?
 NO.

02:07.127 --> 02:09.128
IT'LL JUST BE YOU...
AND ME.

02:09.128 --> 02:10.631
(sighs)

02:10.631 --> 02:13.204
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

02:13.204 --> 02:14.665
GIVING YOU...

02:14.665 --> 02:17.668
A PREVIEW OF WHAT
OUR RETIREMENT'S GONNA BE LIKE.

02:17.668 --> 02:19.670
OH.
 MMM.

02:19.670 --> 02:21.172
MMM.
 MMM.

02:21.172 --> 02:23.174
WHAT ABOUT--
WHAT ABOUT THE KIDS?

02:23.174 --> 02:26.777
THEY ALL LEFT FOR SCHOOL.
I SAW 'EM.
 (laughs)

02:26.777 --> 02:28.779
(both moan)

02:28.779 --> 02:30.781
BUT... IN THE NURSERY?

02:30.781 --> 02:33.153
IN FRONT OF PETER PAN?

02:33.153 --> 02:35.326
IT'S ABOUT TIME
HE GREW UP.

02:35.326 --> 02:37.488
OH! (squeals) MMM!

02:37.488 --> 02:39.790
(both laughing)

02:39.790 --> 02:41.862
(kissing)

02:41.862 --> 02:46.667
YES, THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS
EVERY PARENT MUST REMEMBER.

02:46.667 --> 02:48.699
AAH! (gasps)

02:48.699 --> 02:52.243
OHH! I... FORGOT PAIGE'S DOLL.

02:52.243 --> 02:55.246
I'LL--I'LL...
I'LL TELL HER IT'S DEAD.

02:55.246 --> 02:57.248
LOCKING THE DOOR...

02:57.248 --> 03:00.311
IS ONE OF THEM.

03:00.311 --> 03:12.293
♪♪♪

03:12.293 --> 03:16.297
IT'S A QUESTION
WE ALL ASK OURSELVES.

03:16.297 --> 03:22.202
DO I TRUST THE FOLKS
WHO LIVE NEXT DOOR?

03:24.275 --> 03:28.379
CAN I COUNT ON THE WOMAN
WHO LIVES DOWN THE BLOCK?

03:28.379 --> 03:31.382
WILL THAT COUPLE
ACROSS THE STREET

03:31.382 --> 03:34.645
BE THERE WHEN I NEED THEM?

03:36.317 --> 03:42.393
YES, GOOD NEIGHBORS
ARE PEOPLE WE CAN RELY ON.

03:42.393 --> 03:44.255
GREAT NEIGHBORS

03:44.255 --> 03:48.228
ARE THE ONES WHO DO EXACTLY
WHAT THEY ARE TOLD.

03:48.228 --> 03:51.231
SO THIS IS WHAT
YOU WANT ME TO SIGN?

03:51.231 --> 03:54.465
(taps table)
 YES. DOWN AT THE BOTTOM.

03:54.465 --> 03:57.408
IS THERE A PROBLEM?

03:57.408 --> 03:59.570
I-I'M JUST A LITTLE SAD,
THAT'S ALL.

03:59.570 --> 04:01.912
NOW, WHAT DO YOU HAVE
TO BE SAD ABOUT?

04:01.912 --> 04:04.615
I'M PAYING YOU
WELL OVER MARKET VALUE.

04:04.615 --> 04:06.917
I KNOW. IT'S JUST--
I LOVE THE LANE.

04:06.917 --> 04:09.620
EVERYBODY'S ALWAYS
BEEN SO KIND TO ME.

04:09.620 --> 04:12.953
TO JUST UP AND MOVE
AT MY AGE...

04:12.953 --> 04:14.955
THE NEIGHBORHOOD
IS ABOUT TO CHANGE.

04:14.955 --> 04:17.658
IN A FEW MONTHS, YOU WON'T
RECOGNIZE THIS STREET.

04:17.658 --> 04:20.961
IT'S BETTER TO GO NOW,
WITH YOUR MEMORIES INTACT.

04:22.833 --> 04:25.336
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
IT'S GONNA CHANGE?

04:25.336 --> 04:27.838
YOU DON'T HAVE TO
WORRY ABOUT THAT.

04:27.838 --> 04:30.971
ALL YOU NEED TO KNOW
IS THAT I'M HELPING YOU.

04:36.276 --> 04:39.279
I AM SO SORRY.
 I GOT HUNG UP.

04:39.279 --> 04:41.281
DON'T WORRY. IT'S DONE.

04:41.281 --> 04:43.283
MR. SCULLY SOLD? BUT--
 (grunts)

04:43.283 --> 04:45.586
I HAD A LOT OF DETAILS
TO WORK OUT.

04:45.586 --> 04:48.589
I MEAN, LENGTH OF ESCROW,
DISCLOSURE AGREEMENTS--
 YOU'LL STILL GET
YOUR COMMISSION.

04:48.589 --> 04:51.021
OKAY. (sighs) SO...
WHAT HAPPENS NOW?
 NOW?

04:51.021 --> 04:55.996
NOW I LET THE NEIGHBORHOOD
IN ON MY PLAN.

04:55.996 --> 04:57.698
PLAN?

04:57.698 --> 05:00.631
YOU HAVE A PLAN?

05:13.384 --> 05:14.885
(knock on door)

05:14.885 --> 05:16.417
(door opens)

05:16.417 --> 05:18.419
(Susan) HI!

05:18.419 --> 05:20.551
OH, SO NOW SHE KNOCKS.

05:20.551 --> 05:23.724
IT'S SUSAN.
I'M ENTERING THE HOUSE.

05:23.724 --> 05:26.427
(door closes)
 IT'S OKAY, SUSAN.
WE ARE TOTALLY CLOTHED.

05:26.427 --> 05:29.500
(sighs) OH.

05:29.500 --> 05:31.502
SWEETIE...

05:31.502 --> 05:34.505
YOU AVOIDED MAKING EYE CONTACT
WITH US ALL DAY YESTERDAY.

05:34.505 --> 05:37.508
CAN WE MOVE PAST THIS?
 YEAH, I THINK
THE ONLY FAIR THING NOW

05:37.508 --> 05:39.940
IS FOR US TO SEE
YOU AND MIKE NAKED.

05:39.940 --> 05:43.744
OKAY, YOU WERE RIGHT.
IT'S NOT FUNNY.

05:48.419 --> 05:49.950
YEAH?

05:49.950 --> 05:51.982
I JUST WANT TO SAY
"CONGRATULATIONS."

05:51.982 --> 05:53.384
(chuckles) FOR WHAT?

05:53.384 --> 05:55.886
WELL, I DON'T MEAN
TO BE CRASS,

05:55.886 --> 05:58.389
BUT WHEN I WALKED IN
ON YOU GUYS,

05:58.389 --> 06:00.961
I COULDN'T HELP BUT NOTICE
THAT TOM IS QUITE...

06:00.961 --> 06:03.394
(whispers) GIFTED.

06:03.394 --> 06:05.896
(gasps) OH, THAT.
 "OH, THAT"?

06:05.896 --> 06:08.569
WHEN I OPENED THE DOOR,
I THOUGHT YOU TWO HAD COMPANY.

06:08.569 --> 06:11.572
I MEAN, I'M NOT SURE IF
IT WAS ALL THE TINY FURNITURE

06:11.572 --> 06:14.645
IN THE NURSERY,
BUT HE LOOKED...
 I GET IT, I GET IT.

06:14.645 --> 06:17.808
I'M A VERY LUCKY WOMAN.
 SO WHY HAVEN'T YOU EVER
MENTIONED IT

06:17.808 --> 06:19.810
TO ME AND THE GIRLS?

06:19.810 --> 06:22.413
MENTION IT?
 WHEN WE WENT
FOR MARGARITAS THAT NIGHT

06:22.413 --> 06:24.415
AND WE ALL KIND OF TOLD
EACH OTHER

06:24.415 --> 06:26.917
ABOUT OUR HUSBANDS'...
ACCOMPLISHMENTS,

06:26.917 --> 06:29.990
HOW COME YOU NEVER TOLD US YOU
WERE SLEEPING WITH TOMMY TRIPOD?

06:29.990 --> 06:33.894
TOMMY TRIPOD? HOW MANY
MORE OF THESE DO YOU HAVE?

06:33.894 --> 06:35.896
SIX.
 (laughs)

06:35.896 --> 06:37.397
(laughs) I'M SERIOUS.

06:37.397 --> 06:39.900
YOU WERE SO TIGHT-LIPPED,
THAT WE JUST ASSUMED

06:39.900 --> 06:42.172
THAT TOM WAS ONE OF THOSE,
YOU KNOW,

06:42.172 --> 06:44.675
BUTTON-ON-A-FUR-COAT
KIND OF GUYS.

06:44.675 --> 06:46.977
IT'S JUST SOMETHING
I DON'T CARE TO ADVERTISE.

06:46.977 --> 06:50.681
WHAT DO I CARE IF PEOPLE THINK
HE'S GOT A DINKY ONE?

06:56.016 --> 06:57.718
HEY, CARMEN.

06:57.718 --> 06:59.920
WHAT'S WITH THE MAP?

06:59.920 --> 07:01.622
I JUST SPOKE TO HECTOR.

07:01.622 --> 07:04.495
OH, MY GOD. HOW IS HE?
 WHERE IS HE?

07:04.495 --> 07:08.799
(sighs) STAYING WITH HIS COUSINS
IN SABINAS... MéXICO.

07:08.799 --> 07:11.962
GRACE AND I WILL BE LEAVING
FOR TEXAS IN TWO DAYS. (sighs)

07:11.962 --> 07:13.964
WHAT? SO SOON?

07:13.964 --> 07:17.768
GABY, WE DISCUSSED THIS. WE'RE
STAYING WITH PEOPLE WE KNOW

07:17.768 --> 07:21.141
FOR A FEW WEEKS UNTIL HECTOR
CROSSES THE BORDER AND JOINS US.

07:21.141 --> 07:23.113
AND THEN WHAT?

07:23.113 --> 07:26.777
I GUESS WE'LL TRY TO GET JOBS,
FIND A PLACE TO LIVE.

07:26.777 --> 07:28.078
WHERE? WHAT JOBS?

07:28.078 --> 07:30.781
YOU HAVE A DAUGHTER
YOU'RE DRAGGING INTO ALL THIS.

07:30.781 --> 07:32.583
GRACE IS A STRONG GIRL.

07:32.583 --> 07:36.557
YES, I KNOW, BUT IS THIS
WHAT'S BEST FOR HER?

07:36.557 --> 07:39.459
OKAY, LOOK, I'M JUST...
PUTTING IT OUT THERE.

07:39.459 --> 07:42.132
LET GRACE STAY HERE WITH US.

07:42.132 --> 07:45.766
JUST UNTIL YOU
AND HECTOR GET SETTLED.

07:45.766 --> 07:47.067
THAT COULD TAKE MONTHS.

07:47.067 --> 07:50.070
I DON'T MIND. THAT WAY SHE CAN
AT LEAST STAY IN SCHOOL.

07:50.070 --> 07:52.973
SHE'LL BE SAFE,
BE WITH FAMILY.

07:52.973 --> 07:55.676
HECTOR AND I ARE ALL
THE FAMILY SHE NEEDS.

07:55.676 --> 07:57.678
SHE COMES WITH ME.

07:57.678 --> 08:00.751
CARMEN, I DON'T MEAN
TO MAKE YOU MAD. IT'S JUST I...

08:00.751 --> 08:05.015
I HAVE A SAY IN THIS, TOO.
I'M HER BIRTH MOTHER!

08:05.015 --> 08:08.018
AND I'M JUANITA'S! DOES THAT
MEAN I SHOULD TAKE HER WITH ME?

08:08.018 --> 08:10.721
TAKE HER WHERE?
TO RUN? TO HIDE?

08:10.721 --> 08:13.023
THAT'S THE LIFE
YOU'RE MAKING GRACE LIVE!

08:13.023 --> 08:15.996
BUT HERE, SHE CAN HAVE ANYTHING
SHE WANTS, JUST LIKE JUANITA!

08:15.996 --> 08:18.999
OH, SO SHE CAN BECOME A SPOILED
GIRL WHO NEVER THINKS OF OTHERS,

08:18.999 --> 08:20.070
JUST LIKE JUANITA.

08:20.070 --> 08:22.773
HEY, THERE IS NOTHING
 WRONG WITH MY KID.

08:22.773 --> 08:24.935
NO, YOU'RE RIGHT.

08:24.935 --> 08:27.578
IT'S NOT HER FAULT SHE'S
BEING RAISED BY A BAD MOTHER.

08:27.578 --> 08:30.010
AND IF A LIFE
OF RUNNING AND HIDING

08:30.010 --> 08:34.845
KEEPS THAT FROM HAPPENING TO
GRACE, THEN THAT'S WHAT I'LL DO.

08:38.549 --> 08:41.552
SO WE'LL JUST TELL PEOPLE THAT
YOU SLIPPED IN THE BATHROOM

08:41.552 --> 08:44.054
AND BUMPED YOUR HEAD.
WE'RE OLD. PEOPLE EXPECT THAT.

08:44.054 --> 08:46.557
WHAT WERE YOU THINKING
 WITH THAT BOOK?

08:46.557 --> 08:49.059
I THOUGHT IT WOULD ADD
A LITTLE SPICE.

08:49.059 --> 08:51.531
"KAMA SUTRA."
KAMA SUTURES.

08:51.531 --> 08:53.533
WHERE'D THAT COME FROM?

08:53.533 --> 08:56.607
WASN'T THERE YESTERDAY.

08:56.607 --> 08:58.609
TAKE THESE. TAKE THESE HOME.

08:58.609 --> 09:01.812
I GOTTA MAKE SURE
PEOPLE KNOW ABOUT THIS.

09:01.812 --> 09:03.814
GO! GO, GO, GO, GO.

09:12.983 --> 09:15.285
"CORRECTIONAL CENTER"?
WHAT IS THAT, A JAIL?

09:15.285 --> 09:17.988
I CALLED THE CITY. THEY SAY
IT'S "TRANSITIONAL HOUSING"

09:17.988 --> 09:20.090
FOR FELONS
UNDER HOUSE ARREST.

09:20.090 --> 09:22.763
A HALFWAY HOUSE FOR CONVICTS,
ON OUR STREET?
 EXACTLY.

09:22.763 --> 09:25.836
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
THE CITY BOUGHT THIS HOUSE?

09:25.836 --> 09:27.838
NO. I DID.

09:27.838 --> 09:30.040
YOU'RE RESPONSIBLE
FOR THIS?

09:30.040 --> 09:31.772
SURE AM.

09:31.772 --> 09:33.874
WHAT COULD YOU
POSSIBLY BE THINKING?

09:35.946 --> 09:40.611
THE DAY I WAS RELEASED
FROM PRISON, I FELT SO BLESSED.

09:40.611 --> 09:42.913
I KNEW THAT I WAS COMING HOME

09:42.913 --> 09:45.215
TO THE LOVING EMBRACE
OF THIS BEAUTIFUL NEIGHBORHOOD.

09:45.215 --> 09:47.217
AND MOST INMATES,
WHEN THEY'RE RELEASED,

09:47.217 --> 09:50.220
DON'T HAVE THAT KIND OF SUPPORT.
MOST OF THEM ARE ISOLATED,

09:50.220 --> 09:53.063
WHICH LEADS THEM
TO COMMIT MORE CRIMES.

09:53.063 --> 09:55.766
BRINGING THEM
TO A PLACE LIKE THIS,

09:55.766 --> 09:58.068
WHERE THEY CAN INTERACT
WITH FOLKS LIKE YOU,

09:58.068 --> 10:00.070
MIGHT JUST KEEP A FEW OF THEM

10:00.070 --> 10:03.103
FROM MAKING
THAT UNFORTUNATE CHOICE.

10:03.103 --> 10:06.206
COME ON, PAUL.
WE'VE GOT CHILDREN HERE.

10:06.206 --> 10:08.208
AND I'M NOT SPENDING
MY GOLDEN YEARS

10:08.208 --> 10:11.141
BORROWING A CUP OF SUGAR
FROM DRUG DEALERS AND RAPISTS.

10:11.141 --> 10:12.813
I'M ALL FOR CHARITY,

10:12.813 --> 10:15.145
BUT OUR NEIGHBORHOOD CAN'T
HANDLE SOMETHING LIKE THIS.

10:15.145 --> 10:17.988
APPARENTLY, I HAVE MORE FAITH
IN YOU PEOPLE THAN YOU DO.

10:17.988 --> 10:20.390
OH, MY GOD.

10:20.390 --> 10:23.954
IN A WAY, THIS HALFWAY HOUSE
WILL BE A TESTAMENT

10:23.954 --> 10:29.029
TO HOW I FEEL ABOUT
EACH AND EVERY ONE OF YOU.

11:16.847 --> 11:19.379
♪ IS CRY ♪

11:19.379 --> 11:21.752
♪ NO MORE LAUGHTER ♪

11:21.752 --> 11:24.855
♪ OH, I SHOULD BE HAPPY ♪

11:24.855 --> 11:26.156
(music stops)

11:26.156 --> 11:29.219
(sighs, sniffles)

11:29.219 --> 11:31.021
WHAT?

11:31.021 --> 11:33.323
LYNETTE ASKED ME TO BRING OVER
THIS BIRTHDAY CARD

11:33.323 --> 11:36.226
THAT GOT DELIVERED
TO HER HOUSE BY MISTAKE.

11:36.226 --> 11:38.398
THANKS SO MUCH.
YOU CAN TOSS IT.

11:38.398 --> 11:41.101
YOU'RE NOT GONNA READ IT?
 COME ON.

11:41.101 --> 11:44.805
SOMEONE WHO LOVES YOU TOOK
THE TIME TO SEND A CARD.

11:44.805 --> 11:46.777
"HAPPY BIRTHDAY FROM...

11:46.777 --> 11:48.779
DR. FRANK AT MIDTOWN DENTAL."

11:48.779 --> 11:51.711
OH, LOOK!
YOU'RE DUE FOR A CLEANING.

11:51.711 --> 11:53.784
GOOD-BYE, SUSAN.
 NO, WAIT.

11:53.784 --> 11:55.786
SO IT'S YOUR BIRTHDAY, HUH?

11:55.786 --> 11:58.148
DO YOU HAVE SOMETHING
SPECIAL PLANNED?

11:58.148 --> 12:00.150
I HAVEN'T CELEBRATED
MY BIRTHDAY

12:00.150 --> 12:02.322
SINCE THE THIRD TIME
I TURNED 28.

12:02.322 --> 12:04.995
HEY! WHAT DO YOU SAY
YOU AND I GO OUT?

12:04.995 --> 12:06.997
NO CANDLES, NO CAKE,
NO SINGING.

12:06.997 --> 12:09.830
JUST ENOUGH BOOZE
TO WASH AWAY THE PAIN.

12:09.830 --> 12:12.933
WHY DO YOU ASSUME
I'M IN PAIN?

12:12.933 --> 12:15.936
UH...

12:15.936 --> 12:18.508
I WAS TALKING
ABOUT MY PAIN.

12:18.508 --> 12:22.212
I'VE REALLY BEEN MISSING MIKE
SINCE HE'S BEEN IN ALASKA, AND--

12:22.212 --> 12:25.075
UGH, I HAVE A BUNION
THAT'S BOTHERING ME--
 FINE, FINE.

12:25.075 --> 12:27.778
WE'LL HAVE DINNER.
LET'S JUST MAKE IT EARLY.

12:27.778 --> 12:30.080
I WANT TO HAVE
A BACKUP DINNER LINED UP

12:30.080 --> 12:32.452
JUST IN CASE THIS ONE
GETS TOO DEPRESSING.

12:32.452 --> 12:36.827
OH, I PROMISE YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE A GREAT... TIME.

12:36.827 --> 12:38.829
HEY,
THERE'S MY FAVORITE LAWYER.

12:38.829 --> 12:41.131
AS IT HAPPENS, I NEED
SOME GOOD LEGAL ADVICE.

12:41.131 --> 12:43.133
YOU MEAN FREE LEGAL ADVICE.

12:43.133 --> 12:44.835
WELL, YEAH.

12:44.835 --> 12:46.136
FREE IS GOOD.

12:46.136 --> 12:49.169
SO LET'S SAY HYPOTHETICALLY

12:49.169 --> 12:51.341
I KNOW A WOMAN WHO'S
IN THIS COUNTRY ILLEGALLY.

12:51.341 --> 12:53.143
YOU MEAN CARMEN.

12:53.143 --> 12:55.145
SHE'S NOT THE ONLY ILLEGAL
I KNOW.

12:55.145 --> 12:57.808
HALF OF CARLOS' FAMILY
SCALED A FENCE AT SOME POINT.

12:57.808 --> 13:02.112
NOW, LET'S SAY THIS WOMAN'S
DAUGHTER IS AN AMERICAN CITIZEN.

13:02.112 --> 13:03.383
YOU MEAN GRACE?

13:03.383 --> 13:05.385
HELLO!
STILL HYPOTHETICALLY.

13:05.385 --> 13:08.388
NOW, COULD THE DAUGHTER
STAY HERE WITH ANOTHER FAMILY

13:08.388 --> 13:10.090
IF, SAY, SOMEBODY

13:10.090 --> 13:14.164
ANONYMOUSLY REPORTED
THE MOTHER TO IMMIGRATION?

13:14.164 --> 13:17.167
YEAH, AS LONG AS
IT'S NOT THE SOMEBODY

13:17.167 --> 13:20.170
WHO CALLED IMMIGRATION,
BECAUSE HYPOTHETICALLY,

13:20.170 --> 13:22.232
SHE'D BE BURNING IN HELL.

13:22.232 --> 13:23.934
OH, COME ON.

13:23.934 --> 13:26.236
CARMEN WANTS TO DRAG GRACE
ALL OVER GUADALA-SOMEWHERE

13:26.236 --> 13:29.239
WHILE HECTOR FIGURES OUT A WAY
TO SNEAK BACK INTO THE COUNTRY.

13:29.239 --> 13:34.384
GABY, YOU CAN'T DO THIS.
THEY'RE A FAMILY.
 JUST TELL ME--IS IT LEGAL
OR NOT FOR ME TO KEEP HER?

13:34.384 --> 13:36.046
YES, TECHNICALLY,
IT'S LEGAL.

13:36.046 --> 13:38.818
BUT JUST BECAUSE SOMETHING'S
LEGAL DOESN'T MAKE IT RIGHT.

13:38.818 --> 13:42.252
OKAY, JEEZ! YOU DON'T HAVE TO
JUMP DOWN MY THROAT.

13:42.252 --> 13:45.825
LIKE I SAID,
IT WAS JUST... HYPOTHETICAL.

13:52.432 --> 13:55.866
(beeping)

13:55.866 --> 13:57.868
YEAH, HI.
CAN I GET THE NUMBER

13:57.868 --> 13:59.970
FOR THE IMMIGRATION DEPARTMENT,
PLEASE?

14:01.471 --> 14:04.474
WHAT DO YOU WANT FOR DINNER?
PASTA? MEATLOAF?

14:04.474 --> 14:06.877
I DON'T CARE.

14:06.877 --> 14:08.178
MEATLOAF'S GOOD.

14:08.178 --> 14:11.181
WHY DON'T YOU TALK
ABOUT MY PENIS?

14:11.181 --> 14:14.184
EXCUSE ME?

14:14.184 --> 14:16.426
I OVERHEARD
YOU AND SUSAN TALKING.

14:16.426 --> 14:19.329
I WAS SURPRISED TO FIND
YOU'D NEVER...

14:19.329 --> 14:21.391
BRAGGED ABOUT ME.

14:21.391 --> 14:24.094
THERE'S A REASON
THEY CALL THEM PRIVATE PARTS.

14:24.094 --> 14:26.336
AND WHY WOULD YOU
CARE ANYWAY?

14:26.336 --> 14:29.539
I KNOW WHAT YOU GALS TALK ABOUT
WHEN YOU GET TOGETHER.

14:29.539 --> 14:32.572
GABY LETS EVERYONE KNOW
HOW MUCH MONEY CARLOS HAS.

14:32.572 --> 14:35.275
SUSAN TALKS ABOUT
WHAT A BADASS MIKE IS...

14:35.275 --> 14:36.576
SO...

14:36.576 --> 14:39.279
SO DO I ALWAYS
HAVE TO BE THE JOKE?

14:39.279 --> 14:41.581
THE--THE ONE WHO PAID
TOO MUCH FOR THE CAR,

14:41.581 --> 14:44.354
THE ONE WHO CRIED WHEN
THE COP PULLED HIM OVER...

14:44.354 --> 14:47.257
YOU DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM
SHARING MY SCREWUPS,

14:47.257 --> 14:50.360
BUT GOD FORBID YOU GIVE ME
THIS ONE LITTLE VICTORY.

14:50.360 --> 14:53.063
ARE WE REALLY HAVING
THIS CONVERSATION?

14:53.063 --> 14:54.324
I AM JUST SAYING,

14:54.324 --> 14:58.298
FOR ONCE IT WOULD BE NICE IF
YOU GAVE ME A LITTLE GOOD PRESS.

14:58.298 --> 14:59.970
YOU KNOW,

14:59.970 --> 15:01.331
TELL YOUR FRIENDS...

15:01.331 --> 15:03.333
WHAT I BRING TO THE TABLE.

15:03.333 --> 15:07.177
PLEASE DON'T PUT IT
ON THE TABLE.

15:09.909 --> 15:12.212
I'M SORRY. I WAS LOOKING
FOR MY CONTRACTOR BOYFRIEND,

15:12.212 --> 15:15.385
NOT A... SUAVE
INTERNATIONAL SPY.

15:15.385 --> 15:17.387
WELL, THE RESTAURANT
IS PRETTY, UH...

15:17.387 --> 15:20.550
HOW DO THE KIDS SAY IT?
SNAZZY?

15:20.550 --> 15:23.994
YOU LOOK WONDERFUL. HMM.

15:23.994 --> 15:25.295
SHALL WE?

15:25.295 --> 15:28.298
HANG ON. YEAH, I JUST GOTTA GRAB
ONE THING OUT OF MY ROOM.

15:28.298 --> 15:31.201
(whispers) OKAY.

15:31.201 --> 15:33.503
(sniffles)
 (TV playing indistinctly)

15:33.503 --> 15:37.067
OH, HEY, BREE. I HEARD THE DOOR.
I THOUGHT YOU WERE PIZZA.

15:37.067 --> 15:41.211
HELLO, RICHARD. ARE WE
GOING TO BED OR GETTING UP?

15:41.211 --> 15:43.213
I DON'T KNOW.
LET'S SEE.

15:43.213 --> 15:48.118
AHH. "WHEEL OF FORTUNE."
GETTING UP.

15:48.118 --> 15:49.579
(TV turns off)

15:49.579 --> 15:52.282
SO HOW ARE YOU DOING?

15:52.282 --> 15:54.584
NOT SO HOT.
MARY'S LAWYER CALLED TODAY.

15:54.584 --> 15:56.626
WE'RE STARTING
OUR DIVORCE PROCEEDINGS.

15:56.626 --> 15:58.328
I'M SO SORRY.

15:58.328 --> 16:00.690
OH, THE MARRIAGE HAS BEEN
OVER FOR A LONG TIME,

16:00.690 --> 16:03.693
BUT I HAD NO IDEA WHAT A KICK
IN THE GUT THIS WAS GONNA BE.

16:03.693 --> 16:05.695
I GUESS IT'S JUST HITTING ME

16:05.695 --> 16:08.698
THAT I COULD BE ALONE
FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE.

16:08.698 --> 16:11.201
RICHARD, THAT'S RIDICULOUS.
TAKE A LOOK IN THE MIRROR.

16:11.201 --> 16:14.504
I MEAN, AFTER YOU SHOWER.
 (laughs)

16:14.504 --> 16:18.448
YOU ARE A CATCH.
YOU'RE SMART, ADVENTUROUS,

16:18.448 --> 16:19.449
VERY HANDSOME...

16:19.449 --> 16:22.312
FOR A TIRED OLD GUY
IN HIS 50s...

16:22.312 --> 16:25.315
STOP WALLOWING IN SELF-PITY!
YOU WERE A MAJOR IN THE ARMY.

16:25.315 --> 16:27.287
BE STRONG.

16:27.287 --> 16:29.289
THE ARMY IS EASY.
THERE'S STRUCTURE.

16:29.289 --> 16:32.262
THEY TELL YOU WHAT TO DO,
YOU DO IT. BUT THIS...

16:32.262 --> 16:35.195
FINE! THEN I'LL TELL YOU
WHAT TO DO. TURN OFF THE TV,

16:35.195 --> 16:37.667
GET DRESSED, AND GET OUT
OF THIS APARTMENT.

16:37.667 --> 16:40.600
AND DO WHAT?

16:42.702 --> 16:46.536
(exhales deeply)

16:57.517 --> 16:59.519
READY TO GO?

16:59.519 --> 17:03.593
CHANGE OF PLANS. I'VE INVITED
YOUR FATHER TO JOIN US.

17:03.593 --> 17:05.595
I HOPE YOU DON'T MIND.

17:05.595 --> 17:08.298
BREE COULD SEE THAT
I'M A LITTLE DOWN.

17:08.298 --> 17:11.300
NO. NO, IT'S FINE.

17:11.300 --> 17:15.365
IT'S NOT LIKE I HAD
ANYTHING SPECIAL PLANNED.

17:24.273 --> 17:25.775
THANKS.

17:25.775 --> 17:28.278
OKAY, I CHECKED THE BYLAWS.
WE CAN ALL RELAX.

17:28.278 --> 17:30.780
PAUL CAN'T OPEN
A HALFWAY HOUSE ON THIS STREET

17:30.780 --> 17:33.223
WITHOUT APPROVAL FROM
THE HOMEOWNERS' ASSOCIATION.

17:33.223 --> 17:35.725
AND SINCE HE ONLY
HAS ONE HOUSE...

17:35.725 --> 17:40.460
HE ONLY GETS ONE VOTE.
NO WAY HE GETS A MAJORITY.
 THANK GOD. LET'S CALL
A MEETING OF THE ASSOCIATION

17:40.460 --> 17:43.393
AND TAKE A VOTE SO WE
CAN GET THIS OVER WITH.
 DOES THIS SEEM TOO EASY?

17:43.393 --> 17:46.466
I MEAN, PAUL'S A SMART GUY. HE
WOULDN'T PULL A STUNT LIKE THIS

17:46.466 --> 17:49.169
UNLESS HE THOUGHT
HE COULD GET AWAY WITH IT.

17:49.169 --> 17:51.471
I WISH MIKE WERE HERE.
HE'D JUST GO OVER THERE

17:51.471 --> 17:55.245
AND SCARE SOME SENSE
INTO HIM.
 DO WE KNOW ANY OTHER MACHO GUYS

17:55.245 --> 17:57.277
WHO COULD DO THE JOB?

17:57.277 --> 17:59.109
WHAT ABOUT CARLOS?

17:59.109 --> 18:00.480
OH, FORGET CARLOS.

18:00.480 --> 18:04.154
WE'VE GOT A GUY RIGHT HERE
THAT CAN DO THE JOB.

18:04.154 --> 18:05.455
ROY.

18:05.455 --> 18:07.487
(laughter)
 (Roy) NOT ME. (chuckles)

18:07.487 --> 18:09.489
HEY, WHAT ABOUT THE GAY?

18:09.489 --> 18:12.822
HE LOOKS LIKE HE COULD
DO SOME DAMAGE.

18:12.822 --> 18:15.325
OKAY. HOW ABOUT I JUST
REFRESH EVERYONE'S COFFEE?

18:15.325 --> 18:17.867
'CAUSE IT LOOKS LIKE
THAT'S ALL I'M GOOD FOR.

18:17.867 --> 18:22.302
OH, CAN YOU BE A LOVE AND BRING
BACK MORE OF THESE COOKIES?

18:25.775 --> 18:28.438
(plate clatters)

18:28.438 --> 18:30.310
YOU OKAY?

18:30.310 --> 18:31.811
BOB? ROY?

18:31.811 --> 18:35.185
YOUR FRIENDS THINK EVERYBODY ON
THE STREET IS TOUGHER THAN ME.

18:35.185 --> 18:36.486
THAT'S RIDICULOUS!

18:36.486 --> 18:39.249
HEY, HOW ABOUT WE SEND
LYNETTE OVER THERE?

18:39.249 --> 18:41.891
SHE GOT A SET OF COJONES ON HER.
 YOU SEE?

18:41.891 --> 18:45.455
YOU SEE?
THIS IS ALL YOUR FAULT!
 WH--H-HOW IS IT MY FAULT?

18:45.455 --> 18:48.198
'CAUSE YOU NEVER SAY ANYTHING
POSITIVE ABOUT ME. GOD FORBID

18:48.198 --> 18:51.331
YOU TALK ME UP, MAKE THESE
PEOPLE THINK I'M A REAL MAN.
 A REAL MAN?

18:51.331 --> 18:54.634
ARE YOU SUGGESTING WE MAKE THIS
MEETING A FORUM FOR YOUR TALENT?

18:54.634 --> 18:58.208
WHY IS IT SO HARD FOR YOU
TO SAY NICE THINGS ABOUT ME?
 I DO, ALL THE TIME.

18:58.208 --> 19:01.471
OH, BUT YOU PREFER
TO EMASCULATE ME.
 EMASCULATE YOU?
NO, I DON'T!

19:01.471 --> 19:04.874
YES, YOU DO. YES, YOU DO.
 OH, YOU WANT ME
TO TALK YOU UP?

19:04.874 --> 19:07.377
YEAH, THAT WOULD BE GREAT!
 FINE! I'LL TALK YOU UP.

19:07.377 --> 19:10.620
LISTEN, EVERYBODY. I'VE GOT
AN IDEA. IF WE NEED SOMEONE

19:10.620 --> 19:13.623
TO INTIMIDATE PAUL,
TOM CAN DO IT IN THE MEN'S ROOM.

19:13.623 --> 19:15.255
WHAT?

19:15.255 --> 19:17.257
OH, YOU DIDN'T HEAR?
TOM'S PACKIN'!

19:17.257 --> 19:19.259
WE'RE TALKIN' BIG,
CIRCUS BIG. SO BIG,

19:19.259 --> 19:21.431
HE CAN DRIVE IN THE CAR POOL
LANE WHEN HE'S ALONE.

19:21.431 --> 19:22.932
L-L-LYNETTE...

19:22.932 --> 19:25.935
IF IT FALLS IN THE FOREST,
BELIEVE ME--IT MAKES A SOUND.

19:25.935 --> 19:27.437
TH-THAT'S ENOUGH. THAT--

19:27.437 --> 19:29.939
THE WASHINGTON MONUMENT
LOOKS AT IT AND SAYS,

19:29.939 --> 19:33.473
"I WANT TO BE YOU
WHEN I GROW UP."

19:37.277 --> 19:41.411
JEEZ, YOU'D THINK
SHE'D SMILE MORE.

19:51.321 --> 19:53.263
(spritzes)

19:53.263 --> 19:55.395
(brakes squeal,
engine turns off)

19:57.767 --> 20:01.571
GRACE, YOU WANT TO GO TO
THE KITCHEN FOR A LITTLE BIT?

20:01.571 --> 20:03.303
WHY?

20:03.303 --> 20:05.805
MAYBE MAKE YOURSELF
A SNACK.

20:05.805 --> 20:07.807
YOU ARE SUCH
A BRAVE LITTLE GIRL.

20:07.807 --> 20:09.809
IF ANYTHING BAD
EVER HAPPENS,

20:09.809 --> 20:12.312
YOU ARE SURROUNDED
BY PEOPLE WHO LOVE YOU.

20:12.312 --> 20:14.244
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

20:14.244 --> 20:18.418
(voice breaking) GABY,
IMMIGRATION'S HERE.
 THE MEN WHO TOOK DADDY?

20:18.418 --> 20:21.251
OH, DON'T WORRY, GRACE.
EVERYTHING'S GONNA BE OKAY.

20:21.251 --> 20:22.552
MAMA!

20:22.552 --> 20:25.255
GRACE, LISTEN TO ME.
GO UPSTAIRS TO JUANITA'S ROOM

20:25.255 --> 20:29.399
AND DO NOT MOVE
UNTIL I TELL YOU.
 NO, MAMA!
I WANT TO STAY WITH YOU!

20:29.399 --> 20:31.761
(sobbing) I'LL BE FINE.
(kisses)

20:31.761 --> 20:33.763
I LOVE YOU.

20:33.763 --> 20:36.466
I LOVE YOU.

20:36.466 --> 20:38.908
GO, GO.

20:38.908 --> 20:41.511
(footsteps retreat)

20:41.511 --> 20:44.013
THESE PEOPLE
ARE GOING TO TAKE ME.

20:44.013 --> 20:47.417
I NEED YOU TO
LOOK AFTER MY BABY.

20:47.417 --> 20:51.281
YOU'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

20:58.257 --> 21:01.260
CAN I HELP YOU?

21:01.260 --> 21:03.262
I'M AGENT JACKSON FROM I.C.E.

21:03.262 --> 21:05.635
WE'RE LOOKING FOR
CARMEN SANCHEZ. IS THAT YOU?

21:05.635 --> 21:07.297
(Spanish accent)
OKAY, MRS. SOLIS,

21:07.297 --> 21:10.540
I'M GOING TO THE STORE NOW
FOR OVEN CLEANER.
 ARE YOU CARMEN SANCHEZ?

21:10.540 --> 21:12.001
Sí.

21:12.001 --> 21:14.043
MA'AM,
WE'RE FROM U.S. IMMIGRATION

21:14.043 --> 21:16.045
AND CUSTOMS ENFORCEMENT.

21:16.045 --> 21:18.408
AY, DIOS MíO!

21:18.408 --> 21:20.950
I MIGHT BE LATE TOMORROW.

21:22.382 --> 21:25.415
THIS IS LOVELY, KEITH.

21:25.415 --> 21:27.417
YEAH, BUT IT FEELS LIKE
SOMETHING'S MISSING.

21:27.417 --> 21:29.659
WHAT IS IT? OH, I KNOW.
MY FATHER.

21:29.659 --> 21:32.422
OH, I'M SORRY. I KNOW WE'VE
BEEN HAVING A LOT OF DINNERS

21:32.422 --> 21:34.424
WITH HIM LATELY.
 OH, IT'S OKAY.

21:34.424 --> 21:37.427
IT'S REALLY SWEET THE WAY
YOU'VE BEEN LOOKING AFTER HIM.

21:37.427 --> 21:40.400
BUT I'M REALLY GLAD
IT'S JUST US TONIGHT.
 ME, TOO. MM.

21:40.400 --> 21:42.632
I'LL CHECK ON OUR TABLE.
WANNA GRAB ME A DRINK?

21:42.632 --> 21:44.634
YEAH, WHISKEY UP,
ICE WATER BACK.

21:44.634 --> 21:48.638
(piano playing)

21:48.638 --> 21:50.780
CAN I HELP YOU?

21:50.780 --> 21:54.414
WATSON, PARTY OF TWO.
I'M THE ONE WHO CALLED EARLIER.

21:54.414 --> 21:57.347
OH, YES, OF COURSE. WOULD YOU
LIKE THE RING DELIVERED

21:57.347 --> 21:58.748
IN OUR CHOCOLATE SOUFFLé?

21:58.748 --> 22:01.421
OH, NO. I'M TOO NERVOUS
TO WAIT FOR DESSERT.

22:01.421 --> 22:02.922
HOW ABOUT AN APPETIZER?

22:02.922 --> 22:05.395
WE HAVE
THE JUMBO SHRIMP COCKTAIL.

22:05.395 --> 22:06.756
NOT JUMBO.

22:06.756 --> 22:09.959
I-I DON'T WANT THE SHRIMP
TO MAKE THE RING LOOK SMALL.

22:09.959 --> 22:11.531
THANK YOU.

22:11.531 --> 22:13.463
BREE?

22:13.463 --> 22:15.835
IT'S ME, TRACY!
TRACY MILLER!

22:15.835 --> 22:18.808
OF COURSE!
OH, IT'S BEEN YEARS!

22:18.808 --> 22:20.109
YOU LOOK...

22:20.109 --> 22:22.111
INCREDIBLE. LOOK AT ME!

22:22.111 --> 22:24.013
I'M A STICK.
I'VE LOST A TON.

22:24.013 --> 22:26.045
GOOD FOR YOU.

22:26.045 --> 22:28.047
WHAT'S, UH,
ADAM DOING THESE DAYS?

22:28.047 --> 22:30.620
SITTING IN
HIS STUDIO APARTMENT

22:30.620 --> 22:33.352
AND CURSING MY DIVORCE LAWYER
FOR TAKING ALL OF HIS MONEY.

22:33.352 --> 22:35.124
I'M SO SORRY.

22:35.124 --> 22:37.126
OH, DON'T BE.
(whispers) I'M DOING GREAT.

22:37.126 --> 22:38.788
(chuckles)
 THEY'RE READY FOR US.

22:38.788 --> 22:41.731
(gasps) OH, MY GOD.
IS THIS ANDREW?

22:41.731 --> 22:43.933
I CAN'T BELIEVE
HOW GROWN UP HE IS.

22:43.933 --> 22:47.837
NO, THIS IS
MY BOYFRIEND KEITH.

22:47.837 --> 22:51.370
WOW. I GUESS WE'RE BOTH
DOIN' GREAT.

22:54.003 --> 22:57.046
AFTER THE MUDSLIDES, THERE WAS
AN OUTBREAK OF CHOLERA.

22:57.046 --> 22:59.849
HALF MY VILLAGE DIED.

22:59.849 --> 23:03.052
THAT'S WHEN WE PAID THE COYOTE
TO BRING US OVER THE BORDER.

23:03.052 --> 23:06.886
JEEZ, CHOLERA?
GETTING SHOT AT?

23:06.886 --> 23:08.888
DOESN'T ANYONE HAVE
A HAPPY STORY

23:08.888 --> 23:10.960
ABOUT COMING TO THIS COUNTRY?

23:10.960 --> 23:12.722
(buzzer sounds, door opens)

23:12.722 --> 23:15.124
GABRIELLE SOLIS?
YOUR HUSBAND IS HERE.

23:15.124 --> 23:17.667
OH.

23:17.667 --> 23:22.171
UH, GOOD LUCK. I'M SURE
I'LL SEE YOU ALL AGAIN.

23:22.171 --> 23:25.775
YOU SEEM LIKE
A VERY PERSISTENT LOT.

23:25.775 --> 23:28.938
(telephone ringing in distance)

23:28.938 --> 23:30.910
(chuckles) YOU OKAY?

23:30.910 --> 23:32.942
AS LONG AS YOU'RE NOT
MAD AT ME.

23:32.942 --> 23:34.644
ARE YOU KIDDING?

23:34.644 --> 23:37.617
IT'S A VERY BRAVE THING
THAT YOU DID FOR CARMEN.
 (elevator bell dings)

23:37.617 --> 23:40.620
(kisses)
 YEAH, WELL, YOU KNOW ME,
ALWAYS THINKING ABOUT OTHERS.

23:40.620 --> 23:43.623
(chuckles)
 SO WHERE ARE
 CARMEN AND GRACE?

23:43.623 --> 23:46.125
CARMEN WAS TOO SCARED
TO STAY AT THE HOUSE,

23:46.125 --> 23:48.127
SO I PUT THEM UP
AT A MOTEL.

23:48.127 --> 23:50.630
OH. WELL, YOU CAN TELL THEM
EVERYTHING'S FINE.

23:50.630 --> 23:52.632
THEY CAN COME HOME NOW.
 GABY...

23:52.632 --> 23:55.605
YOU JUST MADE FOOLS OUT OF
A U.S. GOVERNMENT AGENCY.

23:55.605 --> 23:57.967
OUR HOUSE ISN'T SAFE ANYMORE.

23:57.967 --> 24:01.170
CARMEN AND GRACE ARE LEAVING
FOR TEXAS IN THE MORNING.

24:03.613 --> 24:05.675
ISN'T THIS ROMANTIC?

24:05.675 --> 24:07.677
LIKE I SAID, I WANTED THIS

24:07.677 --> 24:10.920
TO BE A SPECIAL NIGHT
FOR THE TWO OF US.
 MM.

24:12.982 --> 24:16.586
SON OF A BITCH.

24:16.586 --> 24:18.187
WELL, HEY, YOU TWO.

24:18.187 --> 24:20.530
RICHARD, HI!
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

24:20.530 --> 24:23.092
I THOUGHT IF KEITH WERE BRINGING
A GREAT COOK LIKE YOU HERE,

24:23.092 --> 24:26.996
IT'S GOTTA BE GOOD. SO I THOUGHT
I'D ORDER SOME TAKEOUT.

24:26.996 --> 24:29.799
TAKEOUT. GOOD IDEA.

24:29.799 --> 24:31.140
(chuckles) YEAH.

24:31.140 --> 24:33.142
I THOUGHT MAYBE I'D, UH...

24:33.142 --> 24:37.507
TAKE THE FOOD HOME AND EAT
IN FRONT OF THE TV.

24:37.507 --> 24:40.950
OF COURSE, IT IS FRIDAY.
THERE'S PROBABLY NOTHING ON.
 (mouths word)

24:40.950 --> 24:46.015
SO I... GUESS I'LL JUST
EAT OVER THE SINK.

24:46.015 --> 24:49.789
WELL, UH, RICHARD,
IF YOU DON'T HAVE PLANS,

24:49.789 --> 24:51.791
WOULD YOU LIKE TO JOIN US?

24:51.791 --> 24:54.794
OF COURSE HE HAS PLANS.
DIDN'T YOU HEAR ABOUT THE SINK?

24:54.794 --> 24:58.868
I WOULD LOVE TO.
LET ME GET ANOTHER CHAIR.

24:58.868 --> 25:01.801
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

25:01.801 --> 25:03.232
THE MAN IS CLEARLY
IN PAIN.

25:03.232 --> 25:05.234
IT'S NOT YOUR RESPONSIBILITY
TO CHEER HIM UP.

25:05.234 --> 25:09.108
WHEN HE IS TIRED OF BEING ALONE,
HE WILL MEET SOMEBODY.

25:11.110 --> 25:12.682
(speaking indistinctly)

25:14.714 --> 25:17.587
MAYBE SOONER THAN YOU THINK.

25:17.587 --> 25:20.920
TRACY, I CANNOT GET OVER
HOW GREAT YOU LOOK.

25:20.920 --> 25:22.822
WHAT IS YOUR SECRET?
 REVENGE.

25:22.822 --> 25:25.795
AFTER I LOST THE WEIGHT, I TOOK
A PICTURE OF MYSELF NAKED

25:25.795 --> 25:28.798
AND SENT IT TO MY EX
TO RUB HIS FACE IN IT--

25:28.798 --> 25:31.801
OR TO SHOW HIM WHAT
HE CAN'T RUB HIS FACE IN.

25:31.801 --> 25:35.765
(guffaws)

25:35.765 --> 25:37.306
AM I RIGHT?

25:37.306 --> 25:39.969
YOU KNOW, RICHARD,
SPEAKING OF...

25:41.911 --> 25:44.974
TRACY HERE HAS
AN INCREDIBLE SINGING VOICE.

25:44.974 --> 25:47.577
OH, REALLY?
 YES, WE MET IN CHURCH CHOIR.

25:47.577 --> 25:50.079
DIDN'T YOU SAY YOU SANG
IN YOUR CHURCH CHOIR?

25:50.079 --> 25:51.851
STILL DO. I LOVE IT.

25:51.851 --> 25:54.854
YEAH, I DON'T SING ANYMORE...
OR BELIEVE IN GOD.

25:54.854 --> 25:57.186
REALLY?
 YEAH, IT'S KIND OF HARD

25:57.186 --> 26:00.189
TO BELIEVE IN A HIGHER POWER
WHEN YOU'RE ON YOUR KNEES

26:00.189 --> 26:02.692
BEGGING FOR HELP FOR
YOUR NIGHTMARE OF A LIFE,

26:02.692 --> 26:04.293
AND YOU GET SQUAT!

26:06.836 --> 26:10.770
SO, YES, THAT'S HOW WE MET--
THE CHOIR.

26:10.770 --> 26:13.272
WELL, TRACY, NOT THAT GOD
NEEDS DEFENDING,

26:13.272 --> 26:15.274
BUT AS SOMEONE
WHO'S BEEN IN COMBAT,

26:15.274 --> 26:19.308
I HAVE FOUND MY FAITH TO BE
A COMFORT IN DIFFICULT TIMES.

26:19.308 --> 26:21.981
ISN'T THAT REFRESHING?
A MAN WITH OLD-FASHIONED VALUES.

26:21.981 --> 26:24.684
I THINK WE SHOULD CUT
ALL FUNDING TO THE MILITARY

26:24.684 --> 26:26.686
AND POUR IT INTO THE SCHOOLS.

26:26.686 --> 26:30.259
I HOPE THEY'LL TEACH ARABIC
IN THOSE SCHOOLS.

26:30.259 --> 26:32.261
SO SHALL WE ORDER?

26:32.261 --> 26:34.794
BREE, CAN I TALK TO YOU
FOR A SEC?

26:34.794 --> 26:36.926
MM-HMM.

26:39.198 --> 26:41.671
"SHALL WE ORDER?" ARE YOU
NOT SITTING AT THAT TABLE?

26:41.671 --> 26:43.302
THIS PLAN OF YOURS
ISN'T WORKING.

26:43.302 --> 26:45.274
I ADMIT, SHE WAS MUCH NICER
WHEN SHE WAS FAT.

26:45.274 --> 26:47.977
LOOK, YOU NEED TO GET THEM
OUT OF HERE.

26:47.977 --> 26:51.340
I HAVE TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT
SOMETHING REALLY IMPORTANT.
 WHAT IS IT?

26:51.340 --> 26:53.813
I CAN'T JUST BLURT IT OUT.
IT NEEDS TO BE DONE JUST RIGHT.

26:53.813 --> 26:56.145
HEY! DID ANYONE ORDER
A SHRIMP COCKTAIL

26:56.145 --> 26:58.317
WITH A PUNY ENGAGEMENT RING
ON THE SIDE?

26:58.317 --> 27:01.620
OH, CRAP!
 KEITH, WHAT IS THAT?

27:01.620 --> 27:03.953
NO, NO, NO.
FORGET YOU EVER SAW THIS.
 BUT, KEITH...

27:03.953 --> 27:05.955
I DON'T WANNA HEAR
YOUR ANSWER, BREE.

27:05.955 --> 27:07.957
THIS IS NOT
HOW THIS IS HAPPENING.

27:07.957 --> 27:10.259
YOU NEVER SHOULD HAVE
INVITED HIM TO STAY HERE.

27:10.259 --> 27:11.801
YOU RUINED
THIS ENTIRE THING.

27:11.801 --> 27:14.163
AND--AND SO DID YOU,
AND SO DID YOU!

27:20.369 --> 27:23.372
WELL, HE CERTAINLY
KILLED THE EVENING.

27:33.753 --> 27:36.285
SO ON SUNDAY,
I MAKE A BIG ROAST CHICKEN,

27:36.285 --> 27:38.187
THEN ON MONDAY, I TURN THAT
INTO CHICKEN SALAD,

27:38.187 --> 27:40.189
AND ON TUESDAY, CHICKEN SOUP.

27:40.189 --> 27:43.032
IT'S AMAZING HOW YOU CAN
STRETCH A SIMPLE CHICKEN.

27:43.032 --> 27:46.065
INTO A 45-MINUTE STORY.

27:46.065 --> 27:49.238
WHEN YOU SAID YOU WERE
THE FUN ONE ON THE LANE,

27:49.238 --> 27:51.340
WHO WAS YOUR COMPETITION--
THE MAILBOX?

27:51.340 --> 27:54.373
I WAS JUST TRYING
TO CHEER YOU UP.

27:54.373 --> 27:56.876
WELL, WHO SAID I NEED
CHEERING UP?

27:56.876 --> 28:00.349
WELL... (sighs)

28:00.349 --> 28:03.783
(lowers voice)
I SAW YOU CRYING YESTERDAY.

28:03.783 --> 28:08.087
(sighs) FOR GOD SAKE.
THIS IS A PITY DINNER?

28:08.087 --> 28:11.020
NO. I JUST--I KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE GOING THROUGH.

28:11.020 --> 28:14.263
BIRTHDAYS ARE HARD,
ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU'RE SINGLE.

28:14.263 --> 28:18.297
BUT I GUARANTEE YOU
YOU'RE GOING TO MEET SOMEONE.

28:18.297 --> 28:20.229
YOU'RE
A VERY ATTRACTIVE WOMAN.

28:20.229 --> 28:24.834
YOU THINK THAT'S
 WHAT I WAS CRYING ABOUT?

28:24.834 --> 28:29.438
HEY. YOU FIND ME ATTRACTIVE?

28:29.438 --> 28:31.440
YES.

28:31.440 --> 28:33.442
WOULD YOU WANNA
GO OUT WITH ME?

28:33.442 --> 28:36.045
YEAH. BUT WE HAVE TO
BE VERY DISCREET,

28:36.045 --> 28:37.346
BECAUSE MY GIRLFRIEND--

28:37.346 --> 28:40.319
SEE? I HAVE NO PROBLEM
GETTING A GUY.

28:40.319 --> 28:44.023
UGH.
SO WHY THE SOB-FEST?

28:44.023 --> 28:45.955
DO WE REALLY HAVE
TO TALK ABOUT THIS?

28:45.955 --> 28:49.899
NO. ON WEDNESDAY,
I MADE CHICKEN POTPIE--

28:49.899 --> 28:51.400
OKAY, OKAY.

28:51.400 --> 28:53.302
HERE'S WHY I WAS CRYING--

28:53.302 --> 28:56.766
I WAS THINKING ABOUT THIS...

28:56.766 --> 28:58.768
GREAT GUY FROM MY PAST.

29:00.739 --> 29:02.741
OH.

29:02.741 --> 29:05.775
IT WAS OVER 20 YEARS AGO.

29:05.775 --> 29:10.379
WE ONLY HAD ONE...
WEEKEND TOGETHER, BUT...

29:10.379 --> 29:12.381
THE WAY HE MADE ME FEEL...

29:12.381 --> 29:17.126
AND THE OLDER I GET,
I KEEP THINKING THAT...

29:17.126 --> 29:19.128
HE WAS THE ONE...

29:21.760 --> 29:25.134
AND I LET HIM SLIP AWAY.

29:25.134 --> 29:28.397
WELL, THAT...
THAT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE YOU.

29:30.269 --> 29:34.403
THERE WAS SOMEONE ELSE
IN THE PICTURE.

29:34.403 --> 29:37.476
LISTEN...

29:37.476 --> 29:41.050
WE NEVER KNOW
WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN.

29:41.050 --> 29:44.083
I MEAN, MIKE AND I
HAD OUR SHARE OF SETBACKS.

29:44.083 --> 29:46.085
BUT I NEVER GAVE UP.

29:46.085 --> 29:49.418
I NEVER STOPPED DREAMING
THAT MAYBE ONE DAY...

29:49.418 --> 29:51.891
IT WOULD WORK OUT.

29:51.891 --> 29:54.063
AND NEITHER SHOULD YOU.

29:57.096 --> 30:01.100
YOU KNOW WHAT, SUSAN?
I JUST FIGURED OUT YOUR THING.

30:01.100 --> 30:04.173
YOU AREN'T THE FUN ONE.

30:04.173 --> 30:05.905
YOU'RE THE SMART ONE.

30:05.905 --> 30:07.306
OH.

30:07.306 --> 30:08.807
(clink)

30:12.341 --> 30:13.512
(spits)

30:15.144 --> 30:17.116
(spits)

30:17.116 --> 30:18.848
(spits)

30:18.848 --> 30:21.350
OH, YOU'RE GOOD.
I'LL GIVE YOU THAT.

30:21.350 --> 30:22.521
IT SPEAKS.

30:22.521 --> 30:25.855
JUST WHEN I THINK YOU CAN'T
FIND NEW WAYS TO EMBARRASS ME,

30:25.855 --> 30:29.228
YOU TOP YOURSELF.
WELL DONE, NUTCRACKER!

30:30.399 --> 30:33.062
WAIT A MINUTE. WAIT.
WAIT A MINUTE.

30:33.062 --> 30:35.064
WE WERE HAVING A DISCUSSION

30:35.064 --> 30:37.366
ABOUT THE FUTURE OF OUR
COMMUNITY, AND YOU ATTACKED ME

30:37.366 --> 30:40.069
AND TURNED IT INTO A REFERENDUM
ABOUT YOUR MANHOOD.

30:40.069 --> 30:41.971
YOU KNOW, I WISH I DIDN'T
HAVE TO DO THAT,

30:41.971 --> 30:43.612
BUT I'M TIRED
OF ALL OF OUR FRIENDS

30:43.612 --> 30:47.476
THINKIN' THAT
I'M JUST A BUFFOON!
 BUFFOON?! ARE YOU INSANE?

30:47.476 --> 30:50.379
EVERY WOMAN ON THIS STREET
CONSTANTLY TELLS ME

30:50.379 --> 30:52.351
THAT I HAVE
THE PERFECT HUSBAND.

30:52.351 --> 30:55.985
THEY DO NOT.
 THEY DO! GABY SAYS
THAT SHE WISHES CARLOS

30:55.985 --> 30:57.356
WAS THOUGHTFUL LIKE YOU.

30:57.356 --> 30:59.889
SUSAN WISHES MIKE HAD
YOUR SENSE OF HUMOR.

30:59.889 --> 31:02.291
BREE SAYS SHE'S NEVER SEEN
 A BETTER DAD.

31:02.291 --> 31:06.295
THEN WHY DO YOU
SOUND ANNOYED BY THAT?
 HOW MANY PEOPLE GO UP TO YOU

31:06.295 --> 31:09.638
AND TELL YOU YOU HAVE
THE PERFECT WIFE?

31:09.638 --> 31:11.500
TAKE YOUR TIME.

31:11.500 --> 31:13.372
WELL...

31:13.372 --> 31:15.204
UH, LOTS.

31:15.204 --> 31:18.077
OH, WRONG. I KNOW HOW
OUR FRIENDS SEE US--

31:18.077 --> 31:21.480
YOU'RE THE HARDWORKING,
NICE GUY, AND I AM THE BITCH.

31:21.480 --> 31:24.383
I AM THE ONE WHO'S CONSTANTLY
EMASCULATING HER HUSBAND.

31:24.383 --> 31:27.316
I'M THE ONE WHO CAN'T WAIT
TO GET AWAY FROM HER KIDS

31:27.316 --> 31:29.418
AND GO BACK TO WORK.
 NO. PEOPLE DON'T SAY THAT.

31:29.418 --> 31:32.621
SEE? YOU ARE SO NICE, YOU CAN'T
EVEN TELL ME THE TRUTH.

31:32.621 --> 31:34.393
FOR ALMOST 20 YEARS,

31:34.393 --> 31:37.496
ALL I'VE HEARD
IS HOW INCREDIBLY LUCKY I AM

31:37.496 --> 31:39.468
TO HAVE A GUY LIKE YOU.

31:39.468 --> 31:44.203
SO IF I DON'T CONSTANTLY BRAG
ABOUT HOW GREAT YOU ARE,

31:44.203 --> 31:47.136
IT'S ONLY BECAUSE
I DON'T WANNA BE REMINDED

31:47.136 --> 31:49.939
OF HOW MUCH
I DON'T DESERVE YOU.

31:52.311 --> 31:54.343
(sighs)

31:57.186 --> 31:59.548
YOU KNOW, I'M THE ONE

31:59.548 --> 32:03.352
WHO SHOULD BE BRAGGING
TO ALL THE NEIGHBORS,

32:03.352 --> 32:06.996
TELLING THEM HOW LUCKY I AM
TO BE MARRIED TO A WOMAN

32:06.996 --> 32:12.101
WHO'S STILL...
SEXY AS ALL GET OUT...

32:12.101 --> 32:16.405
WHO MAKES ME LAUGH...

32:16.405 --> 32:18.467
AND WHOSE HEART IS SO BIG,

32:18.467 --> 32:23.112
THAT EVEN AFTER
RAISING FIVE CHILDREN...

32:23.112 --> 32:28.047
SHE STILL CRIES WHEN SHE HAS
TO PACK AWAY THE LAST ONESIE.

32:28.047 --> 32:31.350
I DIDN'T CRY.

32:31.350 --> 32:33.952
OKAY, I TEARED UP A BIT.

32:40.589 --> 32:44.233
YOU KNOW WHAT
I'M IN THE MOOD TO DO?

32:44.233 --> 32:46.465
I HAVE AN IDEA.
 HMM.

32:46.465 --> 32:49.268
IT DID EVERYTHING
BUT TAP ME ON THE SHOULDER.

32:49.268 --> 32:51.070
MMM.

32:56.445 --> 33:01.350
AND THAT'S HOW YOU GET OUT
OF PAYIN' FOR A TAXI.

33:01.350 --> 33:04.353
WELL, WE WEREN'T IN A TAXI.
WE WERE IN MY CAR.

33:04.353 --> 33:07.356
BUT NOW I KNOW WHY
YOU SHOWED ME YOUR BOOBS.

33:07.356 --> 33:09.358
OKAY, THAT'S A LOT OF STAIRS.

33:09.358 --> 33:11.360
HOW DOES SLEEPING
ON THE COUCH SOUND?

33:11.360 --> 33:13.062
YOU KNOW SOMETHING?

33:13.062 --> 33:17.196
I TOLD LYNETTE YOU WERE
THIS MOUSY LITTLE LOSER.

33:17.196 --> 33:20.229
ACTUALLY,
YOU TOLD THAT TO ME.

33:20.229 --> 33:21.500
OH, I'M SORRY.

33:21.500 --> 33:24.433
'CAUSE I REALLY LIKE YOU NOW.
YOU'RE NICE--

33:24.433 --> 33:27.306
MUCH NICER THAN THAT SUSAN.

33:29.007 --> 33:30.779
OKAY.

33:30.779 --> 33:33.342
NIGHTY-NIGHT.

33:35.414 --> 33:37.516
YOU GONNA BE OKAY?

33:37.516 --> 33:39.788
MM, I THOUGHT I WAS.

33:39.788 --> 33:42.791
I THOUGHT I COULD LIVE
DOWN THE STREET FROM HIM,

33:42.791 --> 33:45.694
BUT IT'S SO HARD.

33:45.694 --> 33:49.458
WAIT. THE GUY
YOU'RE IN LOVE WITH...

33:49.458 --> 33:51.360
HE LIVES HERE?

33:51.360 --> 33:53.502
YEAH.

33:53.502 --> 33:56.765
TOM. (yawns)

33:56.765 --> 33:59.368
TOM?

33:59.368 --> 34:00.769
(whispers) TOM SCAVO?

34:00.769 --> 34:03.642
YEAH. (yawns)

34:03.642 --> 34:07.216
OH, THE LOVE OF MY LIFE.

34:07.216 --> 34:08.746
(gasps)

34:23.061 --> 34:25.764
HEY, RICHARD. I WAS LOOKING
FOR KEITH. IS HE HERE?

34:25.764 --> 34:28.797
NO, HE WENT FOR A WALK.

34:28.797 --> 34:30.799
YOU WANNA WAIT FOR HIM?

34:30.799 --> 34:32.701
IF YOU DON'T MIND.

34:34.743 --> 34:38.306
I AM SO SORRY
THAT I RUINED YOUR EVENING.

34:38.306 --> 34:41.380
WELL, TO BE FAIR,
YOU HAD SOME HELP.

34:41.380 --> 34:44.813
STILL, IF I HAD ANY IDEA
HE WAS GONNA PROPOSE...

34:44.813 --> 34:47.556
NO ONE WAS MORE SURPRISED
THAN ME.

34:47.556 --> 34:51.089
THIS IS NONE OF MY BUSINESS,
BUT IF HE'D PULLED IT OFF,

34:51.089 --> 34:54.592
WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE SAID?

34:54.592 --> 34:58.497
SPEAKING AS YOUR PROSPECTIVE
FATHER-IN-LAW, OF COURSE.

34:58.497 --> 35:01.870
UM... I DON'T KNOW.

35:01.870 --> 35:04.233
IT'S ALL A LITTLE... SUDDEN.

35:04.233 --> 35:07.105
YEAH, THAT'S KEITH. HE'S ALWAYS
BEEN AN IMPULSIVE KID.

35:07.105 --> 35:09.107
NEVER REALLY THINKS
THINGS THROUGH.

35:09.107 --> 35:11.109
WELL, ACTUALLY,
HIS SPONTANEITY

35:11.109 --> 35:14.112
IS ONE OF THE THINGS
I LOVE ABOUT HIM.

35:15.544 --> 35:18.447
CAN I BE HONEST WITH YOU?

35:18.447 --> 35:24.323
I... WOULD NEVER...
PUT YOU AND KEITH TOGETHER.

35:24.323 --> 35:26.255
OH?

35:26.255 --> 35:27.856
YEAH,
I SEE YOU WITH SOMEONE...

35:27.856 --> 35:30.659
STEADY. MORE...

35:30.659 --> 35:32.431
RELIABLE.

35:32.431 --> 35:36.835
SOMEONE WHO SHARES YOUR FAITH,
YOUR OLD-FASHIONED VALUES.

35:36.835 --> 35:40.439
SOMEONE MORE YOUR OWN AGE?

35:46.475 --> 35:51.280
WELL, THAT BEING SAID,
I REALLY DO LOVE YOUR SON.

35:51.280 --> 35:56.385
OH, HEY, I-I LOVE HIM, TOO.
LIKE I SAID, HE'S A GREAT KID.

35:56.385 --> 35:59.157
(chuckles)

36:02.931 --> 36:05.364
I SHOULD GO.

36:05.364 --> 36:08.437
REALLY?

36:08.437 --> 36:11.470
PLEASE TELL HIM
THAT I STOPPED BY.

36:17.576 --> 36:22.251
(sniffles)

36:22.251 --> 36:24.713
IT'S BEEN SO WONDERFUL
GETTING TO KNOW YOU.

36:24.713 --> 36:26.585
YOU, TOO, MRS. SOLIS.

36:30.289 --> 36:32.190
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

36:32.190 --> 36:34.423
(voice breaking)
MEMORIZING YOUR FACE.

36:34.423 --> 36:36.525
TEXAS IS FAR AWAY,

36:36.525 --> 36:39.898
AND I DON'T KNOW WHEN
I'M GONNA SEE YOU AGAIN.

36:39.898 --> 36:41.470
MAYBE SOMEDAY.

36:41.470 --> 36:45.504
YEAH, MAYBE SOMEDAY.

36:45.504 --> 36:47.806
CAN I TELL YOU SOMETHING,
GRACE? (sniffles)

36:47.806 --> 36:51.340
I GREW UP JUST LIKE YOU.

36:51.340 --> 36:54.843
I DIDN'T HAVE A LOT
OF PRETTY THINGS.

36:54.843 --> 36:56.845
BUT I NEVER LET THAT STOP ME

36:56.845 --> 36:59.618
FROM GOING AFTER
ANY DREAM I WANTED.

37:01.550 --> 37:03.422
SO YOU REMEMBER THAT, OKAY?

37:03.422 --> 37:05.454
OKAY.
 (Carlos) GABY...

37:05.454 --> 37:07.996
THEY NEED TO GO.

37:12.501 --> 37:16.435
OH, I WISH
YOU COULD STAY WITH US.

37:18.407 --> 37:19.608
GABY...

37:19.608 --> 37:22.541
OH. OKAY.

37:35.454 --> 37:39.257
I'M SORRY ABOUT WHAT I SAID
ABOUT JUANITA THE OTHER DAY.

37:39.257 --> 37:40.989
(whispers)
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

37:43.261 --> 37:44.993
WE SHOULD GO.

37:44.993 --> 37:46.935
CARMEN...

37:46.935 --> 37:49.267
(normal voice) THANK YOU.

37:51.640 --> 37:54.503
THANK YOU FOR TAKING CARE
OF MY BABY.

37:57.446 --> 38:01.480
THANK YOU FOR TAKING CARE
OF MINE.

38:05.283 --> 38:08.286
(crying)

38:12.561 --> 38:14.062
(truck door closes)

38:14.062 --> 38:15.994
(engine starts)

38:24.773 --> 38:27.776
(sobbing) OH, GOD.

38:38.847 --> 38:41.520
HEY, EVERYBODY QUIET DOWN.
THIS SHOULDN'T TAKE TOO LONG.

38:41.520 --> 38:44.523
WE ONLY HAVE ONE ORDER OF
BUSINESS ON THE AGENDA TONIGHT,

38:44.523 --> 38:46.955
AND THAT IS
THE NEW HALFWAY HOUSE...
 (murmuring)

38:46.955 --> 38:49.458
(chuckles) THAT IS SCHEDULED
TO OPEN IN THE PROPERTY

38:49.458 --> 38:50.759
OWNED BY PAUL YOUNG...

38:50.759 --> 38:53.662
(boos, hisses)
 SO LET'S JUMP RIGHT TO THE VOTE.

38:53.662 --> 38:57.436
ALL THOSE OPPOSED
TO THE HALFWAY HOUSE?

38:57.436 --> 38:59.438
MADAME CHAIRWOMAN?
POINT OF ORDER.

38:59.438 --> 39:01.370
ACCORDING TO OUR BYLAWS,

39:01.370 --> 39:03.542
WE HAVE TO HAVE A 48-HOUR NOTICE
BEFORE A VOTE.

39:03.542 --> 39:05.444
WE'LL STILL VOTE
THE SAME WAY IN TWO DAYS,

39:05.444 --> 39:08.076
AND YOU'LL STILL LOSE.
 YEAH, THAT'LL BE 14 TO 1.

39:08.076 --> 39:11.580
THEN WE'LL TAKE ANOTHER VOTE
TO KICK YOU OFF THE STREET.
 THAT'LL BE 14 TO 1, TOO.

39:11.580 --> 39:13.522
(laughter)

39:13.522 --> 39:17.456
YOU MIGHT WANNA CHECK YOUR MATH.
I HAVE AT LEAST SEVEN VOTES.

39:17.456 --> 39:20.629
HOW DO YOU FIGURE THAT?

39:20.629 --> 39:23.562
WITH THE ACQUISITION
OF MR. SCULLY'S PLACE,

39:23.562 --> 39:25.594
I NOW OWN SEVEN HOUSES
ON WISTERIA LANE.

39:28.567 --> 39:30.869
WHAT?

39:30.869 --> 39:33.802
I USED THE SETTLEMENT I GOT
FROM MY WRONGFUL INCARCERATION

39:33.802 --> 39:37.646
TO ACQUIRE THE EXTRA PROPERTY.
DIDN'T I, LEE?

39:39.578 --> 39:41.149
YOU KNEW ABOUT THIS?

39:41.149 --> 39:44.382
HE WAS MY REALTOR. COULDN'T HAVE
DONE IT WITHOUT HIM.

39:44.382 --> 39:46.985
HE JUST HIRED ME.
I DIDN'T KNOW HE WAS EVIL.

39:46.985 --> 39:52.461
HOW MUCH MONEY DID YOU MAKE
FROM THESE DEALS, ANYWAY?
 NOT THAT MUCH.

39:53.922 --> 39:56.665
SO THAT'S WHY YOU TRIED
TO BUY MY HOUSE.

39:58.467 --> 40:00.098
YOU NEVER TOLD US
ABOUT THAT.

40:00.098 --> 40:03.171
WELL, I MADE IT PRETTY CLEAR
HOW I FELT ABOUT HIS OFFER.

40:03.171 --> 40:05.173
WELL, NONE OF THIS MATTERS.

40:05.173 --> 40:07.536
SEVEN HOUSES ISN'T ENOUGH
TO WIN THE VOTE.

40:07.536 --> 40:09.508
(Paul) THAT'S
AN EXCELLENT POINT, GABY.

40:09.508 --> 40:11.580
I NEED ONE MORE.

40:11.580 --> 40:14.543
AND SINCE THIS HALFWAY HOUSE
MEANS A LOT TO ME,

40:14.543 --> 40:16.785
I INTEND TO GET IT.

40:16.785 --> 40:18.917
WELL, WE'RE NOT GONNA SELL
TO YOU.

40:18.917 --> 40:21.950
I DON'T NEED ALL OF YOU
TO SELL, JUST ONE.

40:21.950 --> 40:23.952
SO IF YOU'RE SURE
IT WON'T HAPPEN,

40:23.952 --> 40:25.954
THERE WON'T BE A PROBLEM.

40:25.954 --> 40:28.597
BUT IF SOMEONE SHOULD SELL...

40:28.597 --> 40:30.559
YOU'LL HAVE HARDENED CRIMINALS
ON THIS STREET.

40:30.559 --> 40:36.064
AND WHAT DO YOU THINK THAT WILL
DO TO YOUR PROPERTY VALUES?
 OH, MY GOD.

40:36.064 --> 40:39.437
YOU CAN'T SCARE US.
 WELL, MAYBE NOT YOU, CARLOS.
YOU'RE RICH.

40:39.437 --> 40:41.540
BUT WHAT ABOUT, UH,
MITZI KINSKY?

40:41.540 --> 40:43.842
WHAT ABOUT ME?

40:43.842 --> 40:46.114
WE ALL KNOW
YOU'VE BEEN LAID OFF.

40:46.114 --> 40:49.177
I CAN OFFER YOU
WELL ABOVE MARKET VALUE.

40:51.720 --> 40:53.952
OR YOU, MRS. McCLUSKEY?

40:53.952 --> 40:57.626
I BET YOUR ENTIRE LIFE SAVINGS
IS TIED UP IN YOUR HOME.

40:57.626 --> 41:00.559
AND, SUSAN,
MY OFFER STILL STANDS.

41:00.559 --> 41:02.691
WE ALL KNOW MIKE
HAD TO GO TO ALASKA

41:02.691 --> 41:04.693
BECAUSE OF
YOUR FINANCIAL PROBLEMS.

41:04.693 --> 41:07.866
BUT IF YOU LOSE HALF THE EQUITY
IN YOUR HOUSE,

41:07.866 --> 41:11.469
WILL HE EVER BE ABLE
TO COME BACK?

41:13.041 --> 41:16.575
HOW MUCH
 ABOVE MARKET VALUE?

41:16.575 --> 41:17.576
MITZI!

41:17.576 --> 41:19.578
LOOK, I DON'T WANNA SELL,

41:19.578 --> 41:21.780
BUT IF SOMEBODY ELSE DOES,
I'M SCREWED!

41:21.780 --> 41:25.684
NO ONE ELSE IS GONNA SELL.
WE HAVE TO STICK TOGETHER.
 HEY! HEY! HEY!

41:25.684 --> 41:28.987
WHAT'S WITH ALL THE WHISPERING?
 THIS IS PRIVATE.
DO YOU MIND?

41:28.987 --> 41:31.920
YES, I DO. WE'RE ALL WAITING FOR
YOU TO TELL PAUL TO SHOVE IT.

41:31.920 --> 41:34.192
WE'RE JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT
HOW TO HANDLE THIS.

41:34.192 --> 41:36.695
THERE IS NOTHING
TO FIGURE OUT.

41:36.695 --> 41:39.668
HEY, MONEYBAGS,
DON'T YELL AT HER!
 THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT
HE'S TRYING TO DO!

41:39.668 --> 41:41.930
I AM NOT YELLING. I AM SIMPLY
TRYING TO EXPLAIN...
 HE'S TRYING TO TURN
THE WHOLE LANE AGAINST...

41:41.930 --> 41:44.873
WHAT THE HELL
WERE YOU THINKING?
 WELL, I DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT HE WAS UP TO.

41:44.873 --> 41:47.776
YOU SOLD HIM SEVEN HOUSES.
 YOU DIDN'T THINK THAT
WAS A LITTLE STRANGE?

41:47.776 --> 41:52.180
THIS IS NOT HIS FAULT,
SO JUST BACK THE HELL OFF.
 OKAY, GUYS. COME ON, EVERYBODY.
CALM DOWN.

41:52.180 --> 41:54.643
(yelling over each other)

41:54.643 --> 41:58.647
WE'RE NOT GONNA LET YOU
DESTROY THIS STREET.

41:58.647 --> 42:00.789
I DON'T HAVE TO.

42:00.789 --> 42:04.553
YOU'RE GOING
TO DO IT YOURSELVES.

42:04.553 --> 42:08.196
IT'S A QUESTION
WE ALL ASK OURSELVES...

42:10.599 --> 42:15.003
DO I TRUST THE PEOPLE
WHO LIVE NEXT DOOR?

42:16.705 --> 42:19.638
WILL THAT COUPLE
ACROSS THE STREET

42:19.638 --> 42:22.641
BE THERE WHEN I NEED THEM?

42:24.172 --> 42:28.717
CAN I COUNT ON THE WOMAN
WHO LIVES DOWN THE BLOCK?

42:28.717 --> 42:35.654
YES, GOOD NEIGHBORS
ARE PEOPLE WE CAN RELY ON.

42:35.654 --> 42:41.259
BUT IF WE DISCOVER
OUR NEIGHBORS CAN'T BE TRUSTED,

42:41.259 --> 42:44.132
THEN IT MAY BE...

42:44.132 --> 42:46.294
TIME TO MOVE.
