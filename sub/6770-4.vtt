WEBVTT

00:03.503 --> 00:04.003
DAVID:
<i>Steve,</i>

00:04.070 --> 00:05.171
of course Janet said no.

00:05.238 --> 00:06.406
You didn't have a ring.

00:06.473 --> 00:07.707
Yeah, you didn't get
down on one knee.

00:07.774 --> 00:08.641
I think she got the idea!

00:08.708 --> 00:10.744
Hey, if you don't
get down on one knee,

00:10.810 --> 00:13.113
-the girl has to say no.
-DAVID: Steve,

00:13.179 --> 00:14.514
you got to tell her.

00:14.581 --> 00:16.416
I have actually been married,
Steve-- listen to me.

00:16.483 --> 00:18.318
Supplication is the key.

00:18.385 --> 00:19.419
She's lucky to have him.

00:19.486 --> 00:21.020
They're lucky
to have each other.

00:21.755 --> 00:22.622
Remember that.

00:22.689 --> 00:24.591
Ask, get ready to beg.

00:24.657 --> 00:26.526
If she smells fear,
you're through.

00:26.593 --> 00:27.761
You clear on all this, Steve?

00:27.827 --> 00:28.628
Oh, yeah. Real clear.

00:28.695 --> 00:31.431
You guys have been
a tremendous help.

00:31.498 --> 00:33.299
KELLY:
<i>Okay, how he asked you</i>

00:33.366 --> 00:35.068
was lame, but he asked you.

00:35.135 --> 00:37.404
Steve's a great guy;
he's the father of your child,

00:37.470 --> 00:40.273
and he asks you to marry him,
you say no, I don't get it.

00:40.340 --> 00:42.776
Steve is a great guy,
and I think that someday

00:42.842 --> 00:45.278
he'll even be a great dad,
but he's also ambivalent.

00:45.345 --> 00:48.047
And I don't have time
for that right now.

00:48.114 --> 00:49.382
I think that's smart.

00:49.449 --> 00:51.351
-Weren't you just leaving?
-Marriage is

00:51.418 --> 00:53.353
hard enough when both people
are equally committed.

00:53.420 --> 00:54.788
That's all I'm saying.

01:02.228 --> 01:03.430
Your baby needs a dad.

01:05.397 --> 01:07.700
All right, check this out.

01:11.438 --> 01:12.405
-DYLAN: Ooh, nice!
-Wow!

01:12.472 --> 01:13.506
You don't think
it's too much?

01:13.573 --> 01:15.508
-No.
-Nah, it's great, considering

01:15.575 --> 01:17.343
it's been in your
trunk all week.

01:17.410 --> 01:18.511
DAVID: Dude, what are
you waiting for?

01:18.578 --> 01:19.813
Well, she turned me down once.

01:19.879 --> 01:22.148
Part of me thinks I should
just leave it at that.

01:22.215 --> 01:24.484
Nah, no way. Look,
show-show us your proposal.

01:24.551 --> 01:25.852
-I don't think so.
-DAVID: Yeah.

01:25.919 --> 01:26.853
Noah, be Janet.

01:26.920 --> 01:27.821
What?

01:27.887 --> 01:29.289
Without my lip gloss?

01:29.355 --> 01:30.790
-Steve, come on.
-I'll give it a shot. Come on.

01:30.857 --> 01:32.625
-DAVID: Let's go.
-NOAH: Come on.

01:33.660 --> 01:35.762
(snickers)

01:35.829 --> 01:38.765
Janet, I know
we've been through a lot,

01:38.832 --> 01:40.867
and I know you're worried
about my commitment...

01:41.935 --> 01:43.369
...but I think

01:43.436 --> 01:45.672
you're the most
incredibly... ugly...

01:45.738 --> 01:47.774
hairy-knuckled...

01:47.841 --> 01:49.809
-I'll never be able to fake...
-That does not work at all.

01:49.876 --> 01:50.777
-This...
-Dude, you're horrible.

01:50.844 --> 01:52.579
No, trust me, you're in there,
Romeo. Yeah.

01:52.645 --> 01:54.447
These are for you guys.

01:54.514 --> 01:55.815
For you.

01:55.882 --> 01:57.617
(laughs):
For you.

01:57.684 --> 02:00.386
Lamaze classes,
baby CPR classes,

02:00.453 --> 02:01.721
babyproofing classes.

02:01.788 --> 02:03.256
Sales at the baby store.

02:03.323 --> 02:05.725
A to-do list: crib, bunting,

02:05.792 --> 02:07.727
doctors' appointments...

02:07.794 --> 02:09.762
The ultrasound, so I can find
out the baby's sex.

02:09.829 --> 02:10.630
You want to know?

02:10.697 --> 02:12.398
Well, for organizational
purposes only,

02:12.465 --> 02:14.601
because then I can
pick out sheets

02:14.667 --> 02:16.135
and clothes and the color
of the nursery.

02:16.202 --> 02:17.670
Why aren't we talking
about Steve?

02:17.737 --> 02:19.506
Don't you see, you guys?
I love Steve,

02:19.572 --> 02:22.208
but I just have too much to do
to worry about him.

02:22.275 --> 02:24.143
So you turned him down
because you're too busy?

02:24.210 --> 02:26.346
If it were me,
I'd take him back,

02:26.412 --> 02:27.747
because I can handle his
indecision.

02:27.814 --> 02:29.215
A baby can't.

02:29.282 --> 02:30.917
And that's why the answer's no.

02:35.722 --> 02:38.358
I didn't realize you had such
beautiful eyes, Steve. Really.

02:38.424 --> 02:39.359
(laughs)

02:39.425 --> 02:40.360
Well, thanks for nothing.

02:40.426 --> 02:41.361
(chuckling)

02:41.427 --> 02:42.428
You know, Steve,

02:42.495 --> 02:43.763
I expect to be
the best man, right?

02:43.830 --> 02:45.932
-Yeah.
-Hey, I'm serious. Best man.

02:45.999 --> 02:47.166
Okay.

02:47.233 --> 02:49.335
She's gonna say no, isn't she?

02:49.402 --> 02:50.703
Look, I don't see how
she can want

02:50.770 --> 02:51.771
your kid and not want you.

02:51.838 --> 02:53.773
What if she does? Then what?

02:53.840 --> 02:55.842
Brother, you're gonna be fine.

02:55.909 --> 02:57.777
Thanks, D.

02:57.844 --> 02:58.945

Hey.

04:33.606 --> 04:34.474
Hi.

04:34.540 --> 04:37.010
You were up awfully early
this morning.

04:37.076 --> 04:38.978
I called the house at 8:00, and
Steve said you'd already left.

04:39.045 --> 04:40.480
Yeah, I had an early meeting.

04:40.546 --> 04:42.615
But she's late, as usual.

04:45.785 --> 04:47.387
Could we try that again?

04:47.453 --> 04:49.689
I had an early meeting,
and she's late, as usual.

04:53.026 --> 04:55.762
Now I know I'm in trouble.

04:55.828 --> 04:57.764
Yeah. I was thinking

04:57.830 --> 05:00.400
about what you said
to Janet last night.

05:00.466 --> 05:01.934
Has she decided what to do?

05:02.001 --> 05:04.070
She is not going
to be with Steve.

05:04.137 --> 05:06.472
So now you're mad at me
because I said marriage is hard?

05:06.539 --> 05:08.508
She wanted to imagine
that it would be awful,

05:08.574 --> 05:09.776
and you helped her do that.

05:09.842 --> 05:11.310
Matt, he threatened
the babysitter

05:11.377 --> 05:12.879
in front of the children.

05:12.945 --> 05:14.781
And then he drove Mackenzie
to kindergarten

05:14.847 --> 05:16.315
in the front seat,
with an airbag.

05:16.382 --> 05:17.483
Okay, maybe we should
go up to my office, okay?

05:17.550 --> 05:19.752
Look, I want full custody.
I don't care what it costs.

05:19.819 --> 05:20.953
And if he comes
to my house again,

05:21.020 --> 05:22.321
I want a restraining order.

05:22.388 --> 05:24.724
Okay, Judy, give me
two minutes, okay?

05:24.791 --> 05:26.626
(whispers):
Bop-bop-bop-bop-bop.

05:26.693 --> 05:27.927
Perfect example
of what I'm talking about.

05:27.994 --> 05:29.896
Married 17 years
to her high school sweetheart.

05:29.962 --> 05:31.397
He was the quarterback,
she was the cheerleader.

05:31.464 --> 05:32.899
They both thought it was
gonna be forever.

05:32.965 --> 05:34.801
Nearly half of all marriages end
in divorce.

05:34.867 --> 05:36.636
That doesn't mean people
shouldn't get married.

05:36.703 --> 05:38.104
I didn't tell Janet
not to marry Steve.

05:38.171 --> 05:39.906
All is said was
for her to be cautious.

05:39.972 --> 05:41.574
Oh, that's
a ringing endorsement.

05:41.641 --> 05:43.710
My experience tells me
not to believe in forever,

05:43.776 --> 05:45.078
and that's all I was trying
to say.

05:45.144 --> 05:46.913
Well, you picked a bad time
to say it.

05:47.947 --> 05:49.649
My client's waiting.

05:53.052 --> 05:55.521
(funky rock music playing)

06:01.894 --> 06:02.995
Can I help you?

06:03.062 --> 06:04.797
Yeah, I'm here
to see Rick Miller.

06:04.864 --> 06:05.798
And you are?

06:05.865 --> 06:07.500
David Silver.

06:07.567 --> 06:09.736
Uh-huh, the guy
from the After Dark.

06:09.802 --> 06:12.472
The one who says
that all women secretly wish

06:12.538 --> 06:13.606
to be one of Charlie's Angels.

06:13.673 --> 06:15.374
Hey, there he is!

06:15.441 --> 06:16.743
Number one with a bullet.

06:16.809 --> 06:18.411
Hey, yeah, I'm doing
pretty good, right?

06:18.478 --> 06:20.446
Good? You, my friend,
got guys calling in

06:20.513 --> 06:21.714
by the truckload.

06:21.781 --> 06:24.450
Hey, I wouldn't date a feminist
if I were you.

06:24.517 --> 06:26.486
But who would?
You know what I'm saying?

06:26.552 --> 06:28.521
Yeah. Uh, can I get a minute?

06:28.588 --> 06:29.589
(whispers):
Yeah.

06:33.126 --> 06:34.560
You know, I-I think
you might have

06:34.627 --> 06:36.462
-the wrong impression of me.
-Oh, I know.

06:36.529 --> 06:39.432
Because if I got to know you,
I would see that deep inner pain

06:39.499 --> 06:41.634
that causes you to be
such a jerk on your show.

06:41.701 --> 06:43.169
Exactly.

06:45.772 --> 06:47.006
I have a meeting,

06:47.073 --> 06:48.674
but, uh, if you write down
your number,

06:48.741 --> 06:51.711
I'll give you a call and...

06:51.778 --> 06:54.113
then you can judge for yourself.

06:54.180 --> 06:55.648
Plus, you've got

06:55.715 --> 06:57.583
a little bit of a Jaclyn Smith
thing going on,

06:57.650 --> 06:58.751
and I kinda like it.

07:04.223 --> 07:05.792
(snickers)

07:08.761 --> 07:10.129
Oh, well.

07:15.768 --> 07:17.036
We, uh, could have gone
to your place...

07:17.103 --> 07:18.571
Oh, that's okay.

07:18.638 --> 07:20.072
There's a kids' clothing store
down the street

07:20.139 --> 07:21.174
I wanted to check out.

07:21.240 --> 07:22.074
Uh, are you comfortable?

07:22.141 --> 07:24.143
Can I get you anything
to drink or...?

07:24.210 --> 07:25.178
-I'm fine.
-Okay.

07:25.244 --> 07:27.747
But, uh, we might as well
just get right to it

07:27.814 --> 07:29.849
'cause I know you want
to talk about Steve.

07:29.916 --> 07:31.818
Actually, I don't want
to talk about Steve.

07:31.884 --> 07:33.619
I want to talk about you.

07:34.921 --> 07:36.656
I think
what you're doing is wrong.

07:36.722 --> 07:39.659
I don't need this right now.

07:39.725 --> 07:40.927
Hi!

07:40.993 --> 07:42.562
Hi.

07:44.697 --> 07:46.632
Oh, what a day I had!

07:46.699 --> 07:48.234
So glad to be home.

07:48.301 --> 07:49.602
-Hi.
-Hi.

07:49.669 --> 07:51.137
Could you give us a minute,
please?

07:51.204 --> 07:52.538
Oh.

07:53.773 --> 07:54.707
Oh, right, sure.

07:54.774 --> 07:56.676
Um, okay.

07:56.742 --> 07:57.677
Sure.

08:01.981 --> 08:04.050
Okay, nobody else
would say this to you,

08:04.116 --> 08:05.084
but I will.

08:05.151 --> 08:06.752
I think you're being selfish.

08:06.819 --> 08:08.821
-I'm looking out for my child.
-How?

08:08.888 --> 08:10.489
By pushing him away
from his father?

08:12.558 --> 08:13.259
GINA:
Sorry.

08:14.760 --> 08:15.962
-(chuckles)
-DYLAN: I gotta tell you,

08:16.028 --> 08:17.930
I wouldn't have blamed Steve
if he ran away,

08:17.997 --> 08:19.732
but he did <i> not</i> run away.

08:19.799 --> 08:22.134
He stepped up,
because you asked him to.

08:22.201 --> 08:24.604
I have to go.

08:24.670 --> 08:28.641
Janet, you got no right
to do this.

08:28.708 --> 08:31.777
And you have no right
to do <i> this.</i>

08:45.691 --> 08:48.694
Great. I'll have Noah Hunter
call you to confirm.

08:48.761 --> 08:51.764
Oh, please, Wayne's the one
you should thank.

08:51.831 --> 08:54.033
He never could stop
promoting you.

08:54.100 --> 08:56.302
Great. Thanks. Bye.

08:59.739 --> 09:00.740
(knocking)

09:00.806 --> 09:04.010
Janet, I love you.
Marry me.

09:05.144 --> 09:07.747
Oh, that's right, cheat on me.
(laughs)

09:07.813 --> 09:09.649
You mind?

09:09.715 --> 09:11.250
(knocking continues)

09:14.787 --> 09:15.721
Hi.

09:15.788 --> 09:17.056
Hey. Come on in.

09:17.123 --> 09:18.190
I brought you something.

09:18.257 --> 09:19.325
What's this?

09:19.392 --> 09:21.227
-I got a demo.
-Let's check it out.

09:21.294 --> 09:23.963
I thought you might like it.

09:24.030 --> 09:26.132
You need them
for tomorrow night, right?

09:26.198 --> 09:28.067
Wait a second.
You already checked.

09:28.134 --> 09:30.169
Well, I was just listening
to the CD,

09:30.236 --> 09:31.804
and I thought... Yeah, I did.

09:31.871 --> 09:33.673
-(laughs)
-All right, thank you.

09:33.739 --> 09:34.740
-Mm-hm.
-I've got a great idea.

09:34.807 --> 09:36.342
Why don't you and I go listen

09:36.409 --> 09:37.343
to this right now, together?

09:37.410 --> 09:38.344
I'd like that.

09:38.411 --> 09:40.613
All right.

09:40.680 --> 09:43.115
So how'd you hear
about this band, anyway?

09:43.182 --> 09:45.351
Oh, I-I think a customer
mentioned it

09:45.418 --> 09:46.752
at the store or something.

09:46.819 --> 09:47.820
Anyway, try track four.

09:47.887 --> 09:49.755
-It's the best one.
-Four?

09:49.822 --> 09:51.590
Yeah. Well, I think
it's the best.

09:51.657 --> 09:53.759
Okay, let's check it out.

09:53.826 --> 09:56.262
(phone rings)

09:56.329 --> 09:57.363
Hello.

09:58.731 --> 10:00.299
"Is this Gina Kincaid's room?"

10:00.366 --> 10:02.635
Uh, well, Gina Kincaid is here.

10:02.702 --> 10:05.237
Would you like to speak to her?

10:05.304 --> 10:06.772
-Hey, Gina!
-Hi. Oh.

10:06.839 --> 10:07.773
It's for you.

10:07.840 --> 10:09.241
Great. Hello?!

10:09.308 --> 10:11.677
Oh, hi, Mom.

10:11.744 --> 10:13.779
Yeah-yeah, this is
the right forwarding number.

10:13.846 --> 10:17.717
Mm-hmm. Oh, and things
got a little cramped

10:17.783 --> 10:19.652
at the beach apartment.
Oh, yeah.

10:19.719 --> 10:21.620
Oh, yeah, it's posh,
right? (giggles)

10:21.687 --> 10:22.621
Uh, listen, I gotta go
right now.

10:22.688 --> 10:23.656
I'll call you tomorrow.

10:23.723 --> 10:24.790
Okay. Bye.

10:24.857 --> 10:26.759
Oh, Mom, the bathroom
floor's heated.

10:29.328 --> 10:31.030
-Hi, gorgeous.
-(phone rings)

10:31.097 --> 10:33.165
Oh. Hello?

10:33.232 --> 10:35.701
Yes, it's heated.

10:35.768 --> 10:36.702
-Sorry.
-(sighs)

10:36.769 --> 10:38.270
-Sorry.
-It's okay.

10:38.337 --> 10:39.705
How you doing?

10:39.772 --> 10:40.706
I'm...

10:40.773 --> 10:41.907
Oh, you're working.

10:41.974 --> 10:43.809
-Yeah, I'm-I'm good, I'm good.
-Need help?

10:43.876 --> 10:45.378
-Listen, no. You know what?
-Oh...

10:45.444 --> 10:47.680
You know how into you
I am, right?

10:47.747 --> 10:49.415
Mm-hmm.

10:49.482 --> 10:53.119
And I'm-I'm very happy that
we're together right now.

10:54.487 --> 10:56.422
Right?

10:56.489 --> 10:57.990
Right.
(chuckles)

10:58.057 --> 11:03.195
Well, there's just
a little problem wi...

11:03.262 --> 11:04.930
with the living situation.

11:04.997 --> 11:05.998
There is?

11:06.065 --> 11:07.199
Kind of.

11:07.266 --> 11:08.834
Because, you know, we never
really talked

11:08.901 --> 11:10.803
about moving in together.

11:10.870 --> 11:13.372
Oh. I know.

11:13.439 --> 11:16.175
It just kind of happened.
I mean, David kicked you out.

11:16.242 --> 11:17.376
-And Donna kicked me out.
-(murmurs)

11:17.443 --> 11:19.311
And neither one of us
had a place to stay,

11:19.378 --> 11:20.312
and now we do.

11:20.379 --> 11:23.049
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

11:23.115 --> 11:25.418
Yeah, we both got kicked out,
that's true.

11:25.484 --> 11:28.854
But see, I-I do have a place.

11:28.921 --> 11:31.357
This is my place,
and-and I just...

11:31.424 --> 11:33.325
Well, I don't know if...

11:33.392 --> 11:36.262
if my place
is-is big enough for two of us.

11:36.328 --> 11:37.830
What?

11:43.235 --> 11:44.136
(Steve sighs)

11:44.203 --> 11:45.438
Janet, I've been giving
it a lot of thought.

11:45.504 --> 11:47.840
No, that's
a little too lawyerly.

11:47.907 --> 11:50.776
Janet, I know we're in
this weird position...

11:50.843 --> 11:53.779
No, that's weird.

11:53.846 --> 11:55.214
This is a very expensive ring
and...

11:55.281 --> 11:56.282
(knocking)

11:56.348 --> 11:57.950
What does a guy have to do

11:58.017 --> 11:59.785
to get a little privacy
in his own...?!

12:01.120 --> 12:04.156
If this is a bad time,
I can come back.

12:04.223 --> 12:07.460
No, no, I was, um, just reading.

12:07.526 --> 12:09.395
<i>-Maxim?</i>
-Yeah, well, you know.

12:09.462 --> 12:10.796
Hey, I'm glad you're here.

12:10.863 --> 12:13.299
There's something I want to say.

12:13.365 --> 12:15.301
-Listen... -Uh, sit over here,
sit over here.

12:15.367 --> 12:16.802
Little better.

12:16.869 --> 12:19.872
Yeah, that's better.

12:19.939 --> 12:22.475
I want you to stop
siccing your friends on me.

12:22.541 --> 12:24.443
What are you talking about?

12:24.510 --> 12:26.479
What we're going through
is very personal and private,

12:26.545 --> 12:28.314
and I don't appreciate
being pressured.

12:28.380 --> 12:29.515
Into making the wrong decision?

12:29.582 --> 12:30.916
Into changing my mind.

12:33.953 --> 12:35.054
Huh.

12:35.121 --> 12:36.856
Well, I'm sorry
if they overstepped.

12:36.922 --> 12:40.126
This is for you.

12:40.192 --> 12:42.128
It's a schedule.

12:42.194 --> 12:43.362
-Schedule?
-Mm-hmm.

12:43.429 --> 12:45.131
You're the dad,
so you should know--

12:45.197 --> 12:46.966
everything about the pregnancy
is on there.

12:47.032 --> 12:48.100
I see you have an ultrasound
scheduled.

12:48.167 --> 12:49.468
I want to know if it's
a boy or a girl.

12:49.535 --> 12:51.003
Oh, I don't want to know that.

12:51.070 --> 12:52.004
Then you shouldn't come.

12:52.071 --> 12:53.439
Because no matter what I want,

12:53.506 --> 12:55.407
you're going to find out
the sex, anyway.

12:55.474 --> 12:57.009
Why am I not surprised?

12:58.377 --> 13:00.479
You want to say something?

13:00.546 --> 13:04.350
Yeah, I did very badly,
but forget it.

13:09.321 --> 13:11.290
(door slams)

13:22.434 --> 13:24.170
-GINA: <i> Hey, that's for you.</i>
-MAN: <i> Thank you.</i>

13:24.236 --> 13:25.437
GINA: <i> Mm-hmm.</i>
<i>Yeah, I'll get that.</i>

13:25.504 --> 13:26.906
-Thank you.
-You got it.

13:26.972 --> 13:28.541
Would you get
these doors for me?

13:28.607 --> 13:29.975
Thanks.

13:33.979 --> 13:35.548
Morning!

13:37.583 --> 13:40.452
I got you coffee--
black, of course.

13:40.519 --> 13:41.820
And... Oh, I got you eggs,

13:41.887 --> 13:43.856
-just the way you like 'em.
-(sighs)

13:43.923 --> 13:46.458
-And some-- a little sausage.
-Oh...

13:46.525 --> 13:47.593
Careful.

13:47.660 --> 13:49.495
-(sighs)
-Thanks.

13:50.529 --> 13:52.464
Thanks.

13:52.531 --> 13:54.366
Morning...
Oh, I got you the paper, too.

13:55.668 --> 13:57.603
There you go.

13:57.670 --> 13:59.405
-Oh...
-You can have the front page.

13:59.471 --> 14:00.573
I'll read this.

14:00.639 --> 14:02.474
I want to see about...

14:02.541 --> 14:04.210
Oh, yeah,
this is what I wanted to see.

14:04.276 --> 14:06.545
There's an article
on, um, New Year's Eve.

14:06.612 --> 14:07.980
It's the millennium.
What do you want to do.

14:08.047 --> 14:10.015
Oh, here, you read it to me.

14:12.451 --> 14:13.919
Go ahead.

14:13.986 --> 14:15.921
This isn't going to work.

14:17.990 --> 14:19.525
You're not trying, Dylan.

14:19.592 --> 14:21.060
No, I am trying.

14:21.126 --> 14:23.262
I... Look, I like the way
things are with us.

14:23.329 --> 14:25.297
I don't... I don't want
to mess with it.

14:25.364 --> 14:26.532
Oh, I see.

14:26.599 --> 14:29.168
So you're kicking me out
to prevent problems?

14:29.235 --> 14:32.137
That and, you know, we're kind
of on top of each other here.

14:32.204 --> 14:33.439
Oh, so it's a space issue.

14:33.505 --> 14:35.507
-It's a lot of things.
-Like what, Dylan?

14:35.574 --> 14:36.742
No, come on, like what?

14:36.809 --> 14:39.078
Tell me the real reason why
you're evicting me. Go ahead.

14:39.144 --> 14:40.546
Well, I'm not evicting you.

14:40.613 --> 14:41.547
-You're not?
-No.

14:41.614 --> 14:42.881
I...

14:42.948 --> 14:44.583
-Look, Gina...
-Just forget it.

14:44.650 --> 14:46.285
-Hey...
-Dylan, no don't e...

14:46.352 --> 14:48.554
Just go to hell.

14:55.494 --> 14:57.062
Got everything you need?

14:57.129 --> 14:59.098
Yeah, a quick sound check
and we're set for tonight.

14:59.164 --> 15:01.567
All right, man, listen, you guys
are doing a really good job.

15:01.634 --> 15:05.437
Listen, I want to thank you
for giving us a shot.

15:05.504 --> 15:06.505
I'm making out on this deal.

15:06.572 --> 15:08.941
Man, you guys are going
to be huge-- big stadiums,

15:09.008 --> 15:11.410
-world tours, the whole works.
-Yeah, I like the way you think.

15:11.477 --> 15:13.112
You're crazy, but I like it.

15:13.178 --> 15:16.448
Well, uh, maybe the world tours
can wait,

15:16.515 --> 15:18.550
but, uh... not the groupies.

15:18.617 --> 15:19.385
There's a plus.

15:19.451 --> 15:21.287
Yeah, yeah,
I'm sure you'll manage.

15:21.353 --> 15:22.521
Hey, if it was groupies
I wanted,

15:22.588 --> 15:24.556
I'd go into my cousin's
line of work.

15:24.623 --> 15:26.125
Chet, if it's groupies you want,

15:26.191 --> 15:28.360
there is no other line of work,
man, believe me.

15:28.427 --> 15:29.528
Beach volleyball.

15:29.595 --> 15:30.929
Your cousin plays
beach volleyball, huh?

15:30.996 --> 15:31.964
Yeah, one of the best.

15:32.031 --> 15:33.565
His name's Wayne Moses.

15:36.201 --> 15:37.469
That guy's your cousin?

15:37.536 --> 15:39.438
Yep.

15:39.505 --> 15:42.574
He dated a girl I know.

15:42.641 --> 15:45.411
She say he was a major dog?

15:45.477 --> 15:47.613
Yeah, you know, that's
exactly what she said.

15:47.680 --> 15:48.981
(both chuckle)

15:49.048 --> 15:50.582
All right.

15:56.288 --> 15:57.523
So, Steve wanted to propose?

15:57.589 --> 15:58.991
Mm-hmm.
Had the ring and everything.

15:59.058 --> 16:00.993
But before he could
get down on one knee,

16:01.060 --> 16:02.294
Janet took his head off.

16:02.361 --> 16:05.264
So, now they're farther
apart then ever?

16:05.331 --> 16:07.499
Maybe we should all sit down
with them or something.

16:07.566 --> 16:10.302
Yeah, skip matchmaking,
go straight to intervention.

16:10.369 --> 16:11.603
Well, it worked for me.

16:11.670 --> 16:14.673
Of course, I was just an addict.
Being a parent's a lot scarier.

16:14.740 --> 16:16.642
-How dare you?!
-Keep him away from me.

16:16.709 --> 16:17.743
MAN:
On our anniversary.

16:17.810 --> 16:19.545
You stood up in front
of our friends.

16:19.611 --> 16:20.746
You said how wonderful I am.

16:20.813 --> 16:23.515
Now all of a sudden, I'm a
threat to you and the children?

16:23.582 --> 16:24.616
Why don't you just calm down?

16:24.683 --> 16:26.485
No, she's trying to take
my children away from me!

16:26.552 --> 16:29.054
The deposition ended an hour
ago, Mr. Spencer.

16:29.121 --> 16:31.557
Excuse me for taking some time
getting over being called--

16:31.623 --> 16:33.325
what was it-- "volatile"?

16:34.460 --> 16:37.262
I read the papers you filed.

16:37.329 --> 16:39.765
The things you said about me?

16:39.832 --> 16:42.234
You don't even know me.

16:43.635 --> 16:45.738
I miss my boys.

16:52.411 --> 16:54.513
(sighs) I want you to go up
to my office.

16:54.580 --> 16:56.515
We'll wait until we know
he's gone, okay?

16:56.582 --> 16:57.616
-Yeah.
-Want something to drink?

16:57.683 --> 16:59.351
-Yeah, a coffee.
-Coffee, okay.

16:59.418 --> 17:01.086
Thanks.

17:03.355 --> 17:04.656
Sorry about that.

17:04.723 --> 17:06.525
One of them have an affair?

17:06.592 --> 17:08.560
No, just change--
drifted apart.

17:08.627 --> 17:10.496
-Hmm.
-Happens all the time.

17:10.561 --> 17:12.498
Nothing lasts forever.

17:12.564 --> 17:14.700
That's so depressing.

17:14.767 --> 17:17.169
You have no idea.

17:22.574 --> 17:25.176
-Hey.
-(rock song playing)

17:25.243 --> 17:26.377
I hate men.

17:26.444 --> 17:28.414
(chuckles)

17:28.480 --> 17:30.449
Well, that's an icebreaker.

17:30.516 --> 17:34.386
They're must selfish and spoiled
and... they never grow up.

17:34.453 --> 17:35.354
Not all men, Gina,

17:35.421 --> 17:37.322
just the ones you seem
to be attracted to.

17:37.389 --> 17:39.558
You know, Dylan
could be so great.

17:39.625 --> 17:42.094
Oh, oh, so that's...
that's why you're with him.

17:42.161 --> 17:43.829
'Cause he has potential
to be great.

17:43.896 --> 17:46.565
Yeah.

17:46.632 --> 17:49.101
And he's extremely sexy.

17:49.168 --> 17:51.503
I got to go do my show.

17:51.570 --> 17:53.205
I'll see you.

17:55.641 --> 17:56.608
Noah.

17:56.675 --> 17:58.377
Hey, I'm expecting Janet.

17:58.444 --> 17:59.411
Have you seen her?

17:59.478 --> 18:00.512
I was checking I.D.s.

18:00.579 --> 18:02.481
It's so funny, we're trying
to get them together,

18:02.548 --> 18:03.782
they don't even know about it.

18:03.849 --> 18:05.384
Look, I'm a little busy
right now, okay?

18:05.451 --> 18:05.951
Well, wait, what do you think
of the band?

18:06.018 --> 18:07.085
They're great, right?

18:07.152 --> 18:08.554
Yeah, yeah, they're fabulous.

18:08.620 --> 18:10.856
Do I get, like, drinks
on the house, or maybe,

18:10.923 --> 18:12.024
oh, just a little,

18:12.090 --> 18:13.692
"Thank you, Donna Martin,"
from the stage or something?

18:13.759 --> 18:15.461
I know Wayne told you
about the band.

18:15.527 --> 18:17.663
So, what difference
does it make?

18:17.729 --> 18:19.832
What difference does it make?
You lied to me.

18:19.898 --> 18:22.167
Would you have hired them
if I had told you the truth?

18:22.234 --> 18:23.502
That is not the point here.

18:23.569 --> 18:24.603
So, technically, yeah, I lied.

18:24.670 --> 18:26.438
But you were in a tight spot.

18:26.505 --> 18:28.207
I was just trying
to help you out.

18:28.273 --> 18:31.577
Well, next time,
spare me the favor, okay?

18:36.682 --> 18:37.683
Check this out.

18:37.749 --> 18:39.451
(keypad beeps)

18:39.518 --> 18:40.619
(phone ringing)

18:40.686 --> 18:41.887
You guys will like this.
Watch.

18:41.954 --> 18:43.121
(clearing throat)

18:43.188 --> 18:45.190
ROBYN:
Hello.

18:45.257 --> 18:47.659
-Robyn, hi, it's David Silver.
-(slow R&amp;B song plays)

18:47.726 --> 18:49.461
-How you doing?
-I'm okay.

18:49.528 --> 18:51.530
Uh, you're on the air.
You okay with that?

18:51.597 --> 18:52.564
No.

18:52.631 --> 18:54.700
I was thinking maybe we could
go out sometime.

18:54.766 --> 18:56.301
You are so lying.

18:56.368 --> 18:58.237
Everyone, say hi to Robyn,
please.

18:58.303 --> 18:59.838
ALL:
Hi, Robyn.

18:59.905 --> 19:00.939
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no!

19:01.006 --> 19:03.308
I will kill you. You do know
this. I will kill you.

19:03.375 --> 19:04.676
Well, you're gonna have
to go out

19:04.743 --> 19:06.245
with me first, all right?

19:06.311 --> 19:08.146
What are you listening to?

19:08.213 --> 19:09.915
FX reruns <i> Quincy</i> on Thursdays.

19:09.982 --> 19:12.251
I was thinking maybe
I could bring the popcorn--

19:12.317 --> 19:14.152
-we can make a night of it?
-You're weird.

19:14.219 --> 19:15.220
Is that a yes?

19:15.888 --> 19:18.724
Well...

19:18.790 --> 19:21.326
I suppose it is.

19:22.661 --> 19:24.563
MAN (on recording):
Goal...!

19:24.630 --> 19:26.331
(cheering and applause)

19:26.398 --> 19:27.699
(laughing)

19:29.268 --> 19:31.436
Thank you.

19:33.839 --> 19:36.808
I mean, Janet might
have said yes.

19:36.875 --> 19:39.278
Yeah, if I wanted her to...
to dice my heart

19:39.344 --> 19:41.346
into shish kebob-like slices.

19:41.413 --> 19:42.714
No, you didn't
show her the ring.

19:42.781 --> 19:44.182
The ring is the money.

19:44.249 --> 19:46.852
No, the only millions a girl
wants from you

19:46.919 --> 19:49.555
are those little tadpoles
swimming inside your shorts.

19:49.621 --> 19:51.456
All right.

19:52.491 --> 19:54.660
The tadpoles are the money.

19:56.762 --> 19:58.697
-Oh. Hey.
-There you are.

19:58.764 --> 20:00.699
I'm so sorry, the crib
wasn't delivered.

20:00.766 --> 20:02.200
And I waited for, like, ever.

20:02.267 --> 20:03.702
And then I tried to call you

20:03.769 --> 20:05.404
and tell you I wasn't coming,
because...

20:05.470 --> 20:07.472
I really can't handle
this right now.

20:07.539 --> 20:10.742
Janet, wait, I know you have
a thousand things on your mind,

20:10.809 --> 20:13.545
but, um... it's important.

20:13.612 --> 20:14.947
It's about Steve.

20:16.281 --> 20:17.516
Look, do you want to marry
Janet or not?

20:17.583 --> 20:18.984
Not if she doesn't want
to marry me.

20:19.051 --> 20:20.452
Forget about that.

20:20.519 --> 20:21.787
What do you want?

20:22.921 --> 20:24.489
I want to marry Janet.

20:24.556 --> 20:25.591
Then ask her.

20:25.657 --> 20:28.493
You know what,
I'm going to do it.

20:28.560 --> 20:29.561
I'm gonna ask her.

20:29.628 --> 20:30.562
All right.

20:30.629 --> 20:31.430
But not without the ring.

20:31.496 --> 20:33.298
-The ring's the money.
-That's right.

20:33.365 --> 20:34.600
I need to practice.

20:34.666 --> 20:37.603
Oh, Noah, people are going
to start to talk.

20:37.669 --> 20:39.638
Yeah, they are.

20:39.705 --> 20:41.340
Janet, will you marry me?

20:41.406 --> 20:42.674
DONNA:
You guys are great together.

20:42.741 --> 20:44.543
JANET:
I don't want to be with Steve.

20:44.610 --> 20:46.745
Steve, hi.

20:46.812 --> 20:48.981
Uh, Janet, look who it is,
it's Steve.

20:49.047 --> 20:51.683
I'm gonna be sick.

20:51.750 --> 20:53.619
So you thought the way I asked
Robyn out was rude?

20:53.685 --> 20:54.686
FEMALE CALLER:
It was disgraceful.

20:54.753 --> 20:56.488
She said yes.

20:56.555 --> 20:57.990
She's obviously
very disturbed.

20:58.056 --> 21:00.325
DAVID:
Listen to me, all right?

21:00.392 --> 21:01.526
Women love jerks.

21:01.593 --> 21:03.295
Take my friend Doug,
for example.

21:03.362 --> 21:05.430
He steals this girl away
from his roommate.

21:05.497 --> 21:06.898
Asks her to move in.
She says yes.

21:06.965 --> 21:08.667
He gets sick of her,
kicks her out.

21:08.734 --> 21:10.535
She loves him more than ever.

21:10.602 --> 21:11.703
He wants service with a smile,

21:11.770 --> 21:14.473
and guess what,
she gives it to him.

21:14.539 --> 21:16.041
Moron.

21:16.108 --> 21:18.977
What the hell is
your problem, huh?

21:19.044 --> 21:21.413
You know, Dylan, a simple
"thank you" would do, all right?

21:21.480 --> 21:23.615
-For what? -I just turned you
into a folk hero.

21:23.682 --> 21:25.550
Tell you what, David,
you do not discuss

21:25.617 --> 21:26.718
my personal business on
your little radio show.

21:26.785 --> 21:27.953
You know what I just realized?

21:28.020 --> 21:30.489
Me talking about what a jerk
you are

21:30.555 --> 21:31.690
is actually making me a star.

21:31.757 --> 21:33.291
And I should be thanking you.

21:33.358 --> 21:36.361
My God, Dylan, I'm sorry.

21:36.428 --> 21:37.529
Thank you.

Oh, please! That's impossible.

22:04.656 --> 22:06.591
I'd like to forget about her,
but I can't.

22:06.658 --> 22:08.593
Well, doesn't sound
to me like you have

22:08.660 --> 22:09.594
a lot of choice.

22:09.661 --> 22:11.630
She's having my kid!

22:11.697 --> 22:13.699
I didn't say forget
about the kid.

22:13.765 --> 22:14.700
I said forget his mom.

22:14.766 --> 22:17.836
Look, Steve, you are going to be
a single parent.

22:17.903 --> 22:19.471
Now, the sooner
you make peace with that,

22:19.538 --> 22:21.640
the sooner you are

22:21.707 --> 22:23.809
utter chick magnet that it is.

22:24.810 --> 22:26.344
What?

22:26.411 --> 22:27.612
Oh.

22:27.679 --> 22:28.880
Why don't you tell Gina

22:28.947 --> 22:30.615
I said good luck
with the house hunting?

22:30.682 --> 22:33.552
Right.

22:34.553 --> 22:35.721
Janet.

22:41.560 --> 22:44.362
I like neat.

22:44.429 --> 22:46.364
I like a neat desk,

22:46.431 --> 22:48.600
neat drawers.

22:48.667 --> 22:52.738
I like charts and graphs
and schedules.

22:52.804 --> 22:53.839
I like order.

22:53.905 --> 22:55.807
I thrive on order,

22:55.874 --> 22:57.676
and, right now,
I don't have order.

22:57.743 --> 23:00.378
I have chaos. And I hate chaos.

23:00.445 --> 23:02.681
Chaos just freaks me out.

23:02.748 --> 23:03.849
And chaos is messy.

23:03.915 --> 23:05.016
You are messy!

23:05.083 --> 23:06.885
Ergo, I freak you out.

23:06.952 --> 23:07.953
Completely!

23:08.019 --> 23:09.087
Because I'm messy?

23:09.154 --> 23:10.956
(voice breaking): And
unpredictable and unreliable,

23:11.022 --> 23:14.626
and I am so completely in love
with you, it terrifies me!

23:14.693 --> 23:15.861
Janet...

23:15.927 --> 23:16.728
Don't, okay?!

23:16.795 --> 23:18.096
Just...

23:19.731 --> 23:20.665
(sniffles)

23:20.732 --> 23:24.002
The thing is, Steve, is
that you surprise me,

23:24.069 --> 23:25.737
and sometimes that is so great.

23:25.804 --> 23:27.839
And sometimes...

23:27.906 --> 23:29.908
I'm sorry,

23:29.975 --> 23:32.677
but I just can't
be surprised right now.

23:45.524 --> 23:46.725
Hey.

23:46.792 --> 23:47.759
What are you doing here?

23:47.826 --> 23:49.194
Matt told me where you'd be.

23:49.261 --> 23:50.629
Look, I-I want to apologize.

23:50.695 --> 23:52.197
I'm sorry. I should
have told you

23:52.264 --> 23:53.665
how I knew about the band.

23:53.732 --> 23:55.100
Okay, why didn't you?

23:55.167 --> 23:56.768
'Cause I thought
it would hurt your feelings.

23:56.835 --> 23:58.036
It's a little late for that.

23:58.103 --> 23:59.171
Look, I am so embarrassed

23:59.237 --> 24:00.672
about what happened
with Wayne.

24:00.739 --> 24:02.641
It was stupid, and I wish it'd
never happened.

24:02.707 --> 24:03.642
Yeah? It did.

24:03.708 --> 24:05.710
Yeah, and it did with you
and Cherise, too.

24:05.777 --> 24:07.179
I know where you ate,
what you did.

24:07.245 --> 24:08.847
I could, I could let this
freak me out

24:08.914 --> 24:10.048
or I can deal with it.

24:10.115 --> 24:12.584
What happened with me and
Cherise was after we broke up.

24:12.651 --> 24:14.152
Okay? I wasn't unfaithful.

24:14.219 --> 24:15.520
Well, it still hurts.

24:15.587 --> 24:16.788
It's not even close.

24:16.855 --> 24:17.656
I know.

24:17.722 --> 24:19.658
Look, I know this is
harder for you,

24:19.724 --> 24:21.626
but they're out
of our lives now,

24:21.693 --> 24:24.696
and as soon as you and I can
start focusing on us again,

24:24.763 --> 24:26.998
the sooner we can move on
with our lives.

24:32.838 --> 24:33.772
This one, right here.

24:33.839 --> 24:34.773
Two bedrooms, two bath,

24:34.840 --> 24:35.774
hardwood floors, fireplace,

24:35.841 --> 24:36.541
-Jacuzzi...
-Oh, stop!

24:36.608 --> 24:37.976
I don't want
to hear about it!

24:38.043 --> 24:39.611
They can make
a death camp sound inviting.

24:39.678 --> 24:40.612
Ugh!

24:40.679 --> 24:41.680
We'll find something.

24:41.746 --> 24:42.881
No, I'm gonna find something.

24:42.948 --> 24:43.882
Just... You know what?

24:43.949 --> 24:45.684
I don't, I don't need you.

24:45.750 --> 24:48.653
I mean, I don't need
your help.

24:48.720 --> 24:51.623
Don't you think you're making
a little much out of this?

24:51.690 --> 24:53.491
Yeah, Dylan, I'm sure somehow
it's my fault

24:53.558 --> 24:54.960
that you don't want
to live with me.

24:55.026 --> 24:57.829
No, it's not anyone's fault.

24:57.896 --> 25:00.932
It's just not...
it's not the right time.

25:00.999 --> 25:02.834
Or maybe I'm just not
the right girl.

25:05.670 --> 25:07.205
I really want to do
this alone, all right?

25:07.272 --> 25:08.773
Yeah, but I wanted to help...

25:08.840 --> 25:12.744
I want to do this alone, okay?

25:12.811 --> 25:14.045
Just go away.

25:18.717 --> 25:20.619
(funky rock song playing)

25:22.787 --> 25:24.723
So that's where your
whole radio bit comes from?

25:24.789 --> 25:26.858
Pretty much, yeah.

25:26.925 --> 25:27.859
You as a loser?

25:27.926 --> 25:30.662
Well, in high school, um,

25:30.729 --> 25:32.130
I was five-four.

25:32.197 --> 25:33.899
I had really big hair--

25:33.965 --> 25:36.568
much bigger than it is now--
and an extremely high voice.

25:36.635 --> 25:40.572
So you were the trusty,
reliable best friend...

25:40.639 --> 25:41.740
I just thought my listeners
would appreciate

25:41.806 --> 25:43.174
a few tips on avoiding

25:43.241 --> 25:45.143
the "I love you, but I'm not in
love with you" speech.

25:45.210 --> 25:47.746
See, now, I just don't see
anybody giving you that speech.

25:47.812 --> 25:48.914
Oh, that's good.

25:50.715 --> 25:52.784
(soft music plays)

25:52.851 --> 25:54.719
You want to dance?

25:54.786 --> 25:57.122
You know, is this part
of the whole routine?

25:57.188 --> 25:58.823
I mean, you know,
rule number one:

25:58.890 --> 26:00.592
"On first date, tell sob story."

26:00.659 --> 26:04.296
No, rule number one is
"Make her feel like a queen."

26:04.362 --> 26:05.697
The whole dweeb story's
optional.

26:05.764 --> 26:08.800
Let's dance. Come on.

26:08.867 --> 26:11.937
Yeah, dancing
would be good, huh?

26:12.003 --> 26:12.971
Thank you.

26:13.038 --> 26:13.972
For what?

26:14.039 --> 26:15.907
For going out with me tonight.

26:15.974 --> 26:17.342
See? This is nice.

26:17.409 --> 26:18.843
Just you and I.

26:23.315 --> 26:24.616
You know I love you?

26:25.817 --> 26:27.919
What?

26:27.986 --> 26:29.988
I'm sorry. I-I just hate
your attitude.

26:30.055 --> 26:32.724
I had a difficult marriage.

26:32.791 --> 26:33.792
My parents are divorced.

26:33.858 --> 26:35.060
That just affects how I think.

26:35.126 --> 26:36.828
You don't believe in
happily ever after.

26:36.895 --> 26:38.196
That affects how I think.

26:38.263 --> 26:39.831
Just because I worry
about our future

26:39.898 --> 26:42.200
doesn't mean I don't think
we have one.

26:42.267 --> 26:44.636
Let's just...
let's just forget it.

26:44.703 --> 26:45.870
Great.

26:48.707 --> 26:50.709
(Judy laughs)

26:52.077 --> 26:55.313
Isn't that your client?

26:55.380 --> 26:56.614
Judy.

26:56.681 --> 27:00.051
Looks like she's
having a good time.

27:00.118 --> 27:02.821
Know what? On second thought,
I'd like to go home.

27:02.887 --> 27:04.656
You want to go home just because
Judy's having fun?

27:04.723 --> 27:06.825
No, because Judy's divorced
and you're divorced,

27:06.891 --> 27:09.094
and practically everybody I know
is divorced.

27:09.160 --> 27:10.829
And Steve and Janet are getting
divorced before they ever

27:10.895 --> 27:13.164
-get married.
-She's happy. I'm happy.

27:13.231 --> 27:14.666
You're waiting to be unhappy.

27:14.733 --> 27:16.668
It's like you're expecting it.

27:16.735 --> 27:19.738
And the thought that I should
be expecting it, too...

27:19.804 --> 27:22.307
depresses the hell out of me.

27:27.445 --> 27:29.047
You're a good dancer.

27:30.081 --> 27:32.283
I'm sorry. What was that?

27:32.350 --> 27:34.386
I said I like this.

27:43.895 --> 27:45.697
DONNA:

27:45.764 --> 27:48.967
says the spring goes between
the rail and the bracket.

27:49.034 --> 27:52.670
Rail and the bracket, of course.

27:52.737 --> 27:54.372
The joys of single motherhood.

27:56.007 --> 27:58.376
Matt could not annoy me more.

27:59.411 --> 28:00.912
Sure he could.
He could be Steve.

28:00.979 --> 28:01.946
(doorbell rings)

28:02.013 --> 28:03.014
Or Noah.

28:03.081 --> 28:04.883
Even a distant third could be
quite disturbing.

28:04.949 --> 28:06.684
He has this saying:

28:06.751 --> 28:08.787
He doesn't believe
in forever.

28:08.853 --> 28:10.121
It's like the Hallmark card
from hell.

28:11.923 --> 28:13.925
-(gasps)
-Are you okay? -(door opens)

28:13.992 --> 28:16.261
I think the baby just kicked me.

28:16.327 --> 28:17.328
(door closes)

28:18.530 --> 28:21.733
Right here.

28:21.800 --> 28:22.700
Ooh, I felt that!

28:22.767 --> 28:24.269
(gasps)

28:24.335 --> 28:27.372
Oh... Oh...

28:28.840 --> 28:30.909
Steve's here.

28:30.975 --> 28:32.243
Just tell him
to wait a minute.

28:32.310 --> 28:35.180
I'm okay. I'm okay.

28:42.787 --> 28:43.922
I like messy.

28:44.989 --> 28:46.257
Messy's good.

28:46.324 --> 28:47.926
I thrive on messy.

28:47.992 --> 28:49.494
Yeah, I know,
and that's the problem.

28:49.561 --> 28:51.729
No, the problem is neat.

28:51.796 --> 28:53.731
It's tidy. It's meticulous.

28:53.798 --> 28:56.201
I got news for you, Janet.

28:56.267 --> 28:58.403
Life isn't about charts
or graphs.

28:58.470 --> 29:02.307
It's about dealing
with disorder!

29:02.373 --> 29:04.776
That's what life's about.

29:04.843 --> 29:07.345
Everything that's on that list,
Steve, is important:

29:07.412 --> 29:10.815
doctors' appointments,
ultrasounds, all confirmed,

29:10.882 --> 29:13.284
all-all important,
all scheduled.

29:13.351 --> 29:17.255
Well, that must come
as quite a relief for you.

29:17.322 --> 29:19.224
You can find out the baby's sex

29:19.290 --> 29:21.426
and paint the nursery
accordingly.

29:21.493 --> 29:23.795
Yeah, well, I care enough
to find out.

29:23.862 --> 29:25.830
I care.

29:27.165 --> 29:29.267
I just don't feel the need

29:29.334 --> 29:32.137
to prove my affections towards
my child to anyone.

29:32.203 --> 29:35.073
I know.

29:35.140 --> 29:37.041
(voice breaking):
I don't want to know,

29:37.108 --> 29:38.776
'cause I want to be surprised.

29:41.212 --> 29:43.781
I want to stand next to you
in the delivery room

29:43.848 --> 29:45.884
and squeeze your hand
when the doctor tells us

29:45.950 --> 29:47.785
we're gonna have a boy o...

29:47.852 --> 29:49.387
or a girl!

30:00.198 --> 30:02.000
(sniffles)
And then I want to come home,

30:02.066 --> 30:06.337
and I want to trip
over that kid's toys and...

30:06.404 --> 30:08.806
clean up his mess.

30:10.175 --> 30:12.143
His mess.

30:13.645 --> 30:15.280
Our mess.

30:22.487 --> 30:24.289
(sighs)

30:39.337 --> 30:41.439
GINA:
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

30:41.506 --> 30:43.575
Great. Yeah, i-it says
wall-to-wall carpeting--

30:43.641 --> 30:45.243
what is that, shag?

30:45.310 --> 30:46.611
Yeah, it's lovely.

30:46.678 --> 30:49.013
Listne, it says that it's
sunny-- is it sunny?

30:49.080 --> 30:51.115
Yeah, you know what,
just forget it,

30:51.182 --> 30:52.250
I-I'll come down.

30:52.317 --> 30:54.452
Yeah, yeah, I'm...
I'm on my way.

30:54.519 --> 30:55.853
Bye.

30:55.920 --> 30:57.555
On my way to Reseda.

30:57.622 --> 30:59.591
You know, I had a client
that lived in Reseda.

30:59.657 --> 31:01.593
Claimed her neighbor's dog
was the reincarnation

31:01.659 --> 31:04.395
-of her dead husband.
-Oh, I don't deserve this.

31:05.697 --> 31:06.431
GINA:
Hi.

31:06.497 --> 31:08.032
-Hi.
-Judy, I'm glad you're here.

31:08.099 --> 31:09.400
Uh, the next deposition is

31:09.467 --> 31:12.136
in an hour, and I have
a lot of questions for you.

31:12.203 --> 31:14.639
Um, what I want to do is focus
on your husband's temper.

31:14.706 --> 31:16.241
You know, things
he said in anger,

31:16.307 --> 31:17.442
times he raised his voice.

31:17.508 --> 31:18.476
He's a good man.

31:18.543 --> 31:20.311
Yeah, I'm sure he is.

31:20.378 --> 31:22.880
A good father, too.

31:22.947 --> 31:24.048
Judy...

31:24.115 --> 31:26.551
I will go in whatever direction
you're comfortable with,

31:26.618 --> 31:28.019
but this is a custody battle,

31:28.086 --> 31:29.554
and custody battles
tend to get ugly.

31:29.621 --> 31:32.156
Your husband's lawyers are gonna
try to rip you apart in court.

31:32.223 --> 31:34.325
That's why we've got to be
prepared for the fight.

31:34.392 --> 31:35.927
We're talking
about reconciliation.

31:38.029 --> 31:39.564
Um...

31:39.631 --> 31:42.533
all right, maybe... I had
a few too many root beers,

31:42.600 --> 31:45.403
but didn't I see you
at the Peach Pit After Dark

31:45.470 --> 31:46.604
last night, dancing?

31:46.671 --> 31:48.406
Hmm? With someone
other than your husband?

31:48.473 --> 31:51.609
Frank Norton-- divorced father
of a friend of my oldest.

31:51.676 --> 31:53.544
For years, I'd see him
at school functions

31:53.611 --> 31:55.546
and wonder, "What if...?"

31:55.613 --> 31:57.081
Now I know.

31:57.148 --> 31:59.517
First kiss-- tongue from hell.

31:59.584 --> 32:02.253
(chuckles)
Judy, I was under the impression

32:02.320 --> 32:04.522
there was more to your
separation than that.

32:04.589 --> 32:07.091
I mean, you sat right here
and talked about growing apart.

32:07.158 --> 32:08.559
You-You sat here
and talked about

32:08.626 --> 32:09.661
not knowing each other anymore.

32:09.727 --> 32:12.597
I thought those were reasons
to give up; I was wrong.

32:12.664 --> 32:14.232
So now you want
to stay together,

32:14.299 --> 32:16.401
even though you admit that
what you had didn't last.

32:16.467 --> 32:17.702
What we had changed.

32:17.769 --> 32:19.537
And like a lot of people,
we didn't

32:19.604 --> 32:21.205
see it happening,
and we panicked

32:21.272 --> 32:22.507
when we realized it had.

32:22.573 --> 32:24.342
But it didn't end.

32:25.443 --> 32:26.644
I don't think it ever will.

32:26.711 --> 32:29.080
And now you think it's forever.

32:29.147 --> 32:31.115
Yes, I do.

32:33.718 --> 32:35.586
(sighs)

32:43.161 --> 32:44.729
There's the head,

32:44.796 --> 32:48.299
and the spinal cord,
the feet and toes.

32:48.366 --> 32:49.667
We can estimate
the height and weight

32:49.734 --> 32:52.203
and project what
the baby will be at birth.

32:52.270 --> 32:54.172
-Do you want to know?
-Are you kidding?

32:54.238 --> 32:56.641
I want to know everything.

32:56.708 --> 32:57.642
Hi.

32:57.709 --> 32:59.610
Sorry I'm late.
How's my baby?

32:59.677 --> 33:01.012
Doing great.

33:01.079 --> 33:02.213
How's my girl?

33:02.280 --> 33:04.515
Uh, I'm... not really sure.

33:04.582 --> 33:06.751
You know, Janet,
I was up late last night

33:06.818 --> 33:10.154
trying to figure it out,
and mess, no mess...

33:10.221 --> 33:11.389
I don't care.

33:11.456 --> 33:13.591
We could finish this later.

33:13.658 --> 33:16.327
This isn't how I practiced it,
but what the hell?

33:16.394 --> 33:18.262
-(laughs): What are you doing?
-Janet...

33:19.464 --> 33:21.566
...would you do me
the incredible honor

33:21.632 --> 33:23.201
of being my wife?

33:36.714 --> 33:38.616
(laughs):
Yes, all right!

33:40.518 --> 33:42.620
I love you.

33:42.687 --> 33:43.755
STEVE:
Oops.

33:43.821 --> 33:45.123
Ooh.

33:46.224 --> 33:48.459
STEVE (whispers):
There.

33:48.526 --> 33:51.529
(laughs):
It's perfect.

33:54.632 --> 33:56.234
How much longer, Doc?

33:56.300 --> 33:58.503
The only thing left
is the sex of the baby.

33:58.569 --> 34:01.606
Do you want to know?

34:01.672 --> 34:04.041
No, we don't.

34:04.108 --> 34:07.712
It turns out there aren't
enough surprises in life.

34:12.216 --> 34:14.217
(laughs)

34:15.686 --> 34:18.255
(phone rings)

34:18.322 --> 34:19.556
Hello?

34:19.623 --> 34:21.659
-Hi, David. It's Robyn.
-Robyn, hey. What's up?

34:21.726 --> 34:24.562
Hi. I just called to wish you
good luck with the show tonight.

34:24.629 --> 34:25.429
Thank you very much.

34:25.496 --> 34:28.065
Hey, can't wait to hear
about the date.

34:28.132 --> 34:29.300
What?

34:29.367 --> 34:30.301
Hold on a second.

34:30.368 --> 34:31.702
Huh? What are you talking about?

34:31.768 --> 34:33.670
The date. The one
you set up on the air.

34:33.737 --> 34:35.773
I predict record numbers
tuning to hear how it went.

34:35.840 --> 34:37.507
Oh, well, people
are gonna be disappointed,

34:37.574 --> 34:38.643
'cause I'm not talking about it.

34:38.708 --> 34:39.577
Uh-huh. Like they're gonna

34:39.643 --> 34:42.713
let you talk about
something else? (laughs)

34:43.614 --> 34:45.416
Sorry about that.

34:45.483 --> 34:46.583
No problem.
Listen, you're busy.

34:46.650 --> 34:49.654
Um, I just called to let
you know that I'd be listening.

34:49.719 --> 34:51.188
ROBYN:
Okay?

34:51.255 --> 34:53.658
So, um... bye.

34:53.724 --> 34:55.092
Bye.

34:59.497 --> 35:01.399
(laughs)

35:01.466 --> 35:03.367
Hi.

35:03.434 --> 35:05.536
Hey. Thanks for coming down.

35:05.603 --> 35:07.605
-I owe you.
-Well, yesterday you thought

35:07.672 --> 35:08.573
you owed Wayne.

35:08.639 --> 35:10.408
You sure it wasn't the response

35:10.475 --> 35:12.210
of them that made you
change your mind?

35:12.276 --> 35:13.511
Yeah, I'm sure.

35:13.578 --> 35:15.613
I just don't like
to be reminded all the time.

35:15.680 --> 35:18.449
It's over, you know that.

35:18.516 --> 35:20.418
I know.

35:21.652 --> 35:24.155
It's this whole, uh,
starting over thing.

35:24.222 --> 35:25.490
-Yeah?
-Exactly which part

35:25.556 --> 35:27.158
would you like to start at?

35:28.426 --> 35:30.661
What do you suggest?

35:30.728 --> 35:33.331
I like this right here.

35:33.397 --> 35:36.133
-Hm?
-How about this?

35:42.707 --> 35:44.308
I like that.
(laughs)

35:44.375 --> 35:46.377
Mm.

35:46.444 --> 35:48.346
All right,
let's go to the phones.

35:48.412 --> 35:49.614
Bill, you're on.

35:49.680 --> 35:51.682
BILL: Hey!
I want details on the date!

35:51.749 --> 35:54.218
Lost you, Bill.
Chuck, how you doing?

35:54.285 --> 35:56.554
CHUCK:
I got 20 bucks says you scored.

35:56.621 --> 35:57.722
Did I win or lose?

35:57.788 --> 36:00.291
Doug. What's up, buddy?

36:00.358 --> 36:03.528
DYLAN: Doesn't feel good
being on the other end, does it?

36:03.594 --> 36:05.630
Having people talk about you.

36:05.696 --> 36:07.265
Or are you just
not answering questions

36:07.331 --> 36:08.633
because the date was a bust?

36:08.699 --> 36:09.867
Doug, I'm not
answering questions

36:09.934 --> 36:11.669
because it's
nobody else's business.

36:11.736 --> 36:12.537
(chuckles)
In other words,

36:12.603 --> 36:14.572
you crashed and burned,
huh, tough guy?

36:14.639 --> 36:16.207
-No.
-So you scored?

36:16.274 --> 36:17.708
Or is it a question of,

36:17.775 --> 36:20.511
those who can do,
and those who can't

36:20.578 --> 36:22.713
just talk about it
on the radio?

36:24.682 --> 36:26.551
(click)

36:29.754 --> 36:32.657
You guys want to hear
about my date?

36:32.723 --> 36:34.425
Fine.

36:35.826 --> 36:37.728
(knocking on door)

36:40.298 --> 36:41.399
Hi.

36:41.465 --> 36:42.633
Hey.

36:50.341 --> 36:53.678
You know, I, uh, I've been
thinking about what you said,

36:53.744 --> 36:57.682
expecting to be unhappy, and,
uh, well, you shouldn't have to.

36:57.748 --> 36:59.750
Then why do you?

36:59.817 --> 37:01.419
Well, I didn't

37:01.485 --> 37:03.521
before losing Lauren, and...

37:03.588 --> 37:05.656
after, I guess it just
made things easier.

37:05.723 --> 37:08.859
Protected against the down side.

37:08.926 --> 37:11.295
(exhales)
That's no way to live.

37:11.362 --> 37:13.297
(laughs softly)

37:13.364 --> 37:15.833
Uh, my client,
the one we saw last night,

37:15.900 --> 37:18.436
she and her husband
decided to reconcile.

37:18.502 --> 37:19.437
Really?

37:19.503 --> 37:20.671
Mm-hmm.

37:20.738 --> 37:22.607
Did you hear
about Steve and Janet?

37:22.673 --> 37:25.009
Mm, yes, I did.

37:25.076 --> 37:27.645
Don't look now,
but you are surrounded

37:27.712 --> 37:29.580
by happily-ever-after.

37:29.647 --> 37:31.716
I hope so.

37:50.768 --> 37:51.736
(beeping)

37:51.802 --> 37:52.970
ANSWERING MACHINE:
It's Robyn.

37:53.037 --> 37:56.474
I want you to know that I have
never been more humiliated.

37:56.540 --> 37:58.676
Asking me out on the air
was one thing,

37:58.743 --> 38:01.646
but talking about what we did
and how we kissed

38:01.712 --> 38:03.581
when you knew that I was
listening to the show?

38:03.648 --> 38:05.950
I'm sorry, but that
is just plain cruel.

38:06.017 --> 38:08.986
(click, dial tone drones)

38:12.423 --> 38:13.658
Hey, where you been?

38:13.724 --> 38:15.359
I was trying to call you.

38:15.426 --> 38:16.460
I have been in Reseda.

38:16.527 --> 38:18.429
I actually rented an apartment
in beautiful Reseda.

38:18.496 --> 38:20.431
I put a first and last down
in Reseda.

38:20.498 --> 38:21.732
And don't give me
the speech about

38:21.799 --> 38:23.901
this is the best thing for me,
because it's not.

38:23.968 --> 38:25.870
Well, then luckily for me,
I have a fallback.

38:25.936 --> 38:27.872
-Oh, I could get violent.
-Even if I said

38:27.938 --> 38:29.640
I don't want you
to live in Reseda?

38:29.707 --> 38:31.842
My worst enemy wouldn't want me
to live in Reseda.

38:31.909 --> 38:35.079
Well, then how about if I said
I want you to stay at the hotel?

38:35.146 --> 38:36.914
What'd you say?

38:36.981 --> 38:38.349
(laughs):
Will you pinch me?

38:38.416 --> 38:40.084
-What'd you just say?
-I want you to stay

38:40.151 --> 38:42.086
at the hotel, and I've
made all the arrangements.

38:42.153 --> 38:44.855
Oh, my God, you...

38:44.922 --> 38:48.392
(laughs):
Oh...

38:48.459 --> 38:49.860
Oh, I just knew...

38:49.927 --> 38:51.729
I mean, I didn't... I didn't...

38:51.796 --> 38:53.464
I didn't know that
you would come around,

38:53.531 --> 38:56.333
but I just... I hoped
that you would come around.

38:56.400 --> 38:58.703
Oh, we'll have so much fun
living together.

38:58.769 --> 38:59.837
Yeah. Well, you know, it's not

38:59.904 --> 39:01.439
-exactly together.
-Yeah, you just said

39:01.505 --> 39:03.040
-you want me to stay with you.
-In the hotel.

39:03.107 --> 39:04.742
-Oh.
-See, I got you a room,

39:04.809 --> 39:07.445
and it's one floor below,
and just for kicks,

39:07.511 --> 39:09.080
I entered you in as Mrs. McKay.

39:09.146 --> 39:11.515
Wait, you-you signed me in
as your wife,

39:11.582 --> 39:13.384
but you got me a separate room?

39:13.451 --> 39:14.752
Hey, you can
kiss Reseda good-bye.

39:14.819 --> 39:16.087
Yeah, along with my self-esteem.

39:16.153 --> 39:18.556
You know, I-I thought
you wanted to stay here.

39:18.622 --> 39:20.758
Dylan, I...
did want to stay here.

39:20.825 --> 39:22.760
I wanted to stay...

39:22.827 --> 39:25.529
here with you, you know,
as your girlfriend.

39:25.596 --> 39:26.897
(Dylan sighs)

39:26.964 --> 39:29.633
Not down the hall
like some concubine.

39:29.700 --> 39:30.968
You make it sound cheap.

39:31.035 --> 39:32.570
Well, it feels cheap.

39:32.636 --> 39:34.672
-You want it or not?
-No, I don't. What-what...

39:34.739 --> 39:36.774
a separate room
for services rendered?

39:38.476 --> 39:40.778
I guess that's what
you think I deserve.

39:51.756 --> 39:54.492
I thought white
would be good either way,

39:54.558 --> 39:55.726
boy or girl.

39:55.793 --> 39:57.595
We can get unisex stuff

39:57.661 --> 40:01.532
and then fill in
with the right color later.

40:01.599 --> 40:03.033
I'm so sorry.

40:04.068 --> 40:05.803
For what?

40:07.471 --> 40:08.873
(crying quietly)

40:08.939 --> 40:10.708
For pushing you away.

40:10.775 --> 40:12.743
For saying no.

40:12.810 --> 40:14.578
For being an idiot.

40:14.645 --> 40:16.814
(sighs)
Come here.

40:17.782 --> 40:19.683
Come here.

40:20.985 --> 40:22.987
(Janet sniffles)

40:23.053 --> 40:25.756
I was just so scared, you know?

40:27.558 --> 40:29.160
That I'd let you get close to me

40:29.226 --> 40:31.896
and that, one day,
you'd leave me.

40:31.962 --> 40:33.798
That you'd realize that...

40:33.864 --> 40:36.801
you married me
for all the wrong reasons.

40:36.867 --> 40:38.669
That's not gonna happen.

40:38.736 --> 40:40.571
I love you...

40:40.638 --> 40:43.174
and like it or not,
you're stuck with me.

40:43.240 --> 40:45.976
(whispers):
I like it.

40:47.778 --> 40:48.946
(Janet sniffles)

40:49.013 --> 40:51.081
I have a surprise for you.

40:51.148 --> 40:53.818
-You do?
-Yes.

40:54.985 --> 40:56.821
What is it?

41:03.594 --> 41:07.064
I think it's the most beautiful
baby I've ever seen.

41:07.131 --> 41:10.167
That's because this baby
looks just like its mother.
