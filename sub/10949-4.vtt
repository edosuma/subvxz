You've come hundreds of miles
from your little village

08:15.660 --> 08:18.460
where you're the best
swordsman in town

08:18.540 --> 08:21.670

to learn from the master.

all over the world.

08:24.590 --> 08:26.880

08:26.970 --> 08:30.930
And I know one thing for sure,
I have a lot to learn.

08:31.850 --> 08:34.970
You're not doing a very good job
of selling yourself.

08:35.060 --> 08:36.560
I know.

08:36.640 --> 08:39.480
Your butler told me that when I met you,
I would have to prove my worth

08:39.560 --> 08:42.360
But the truth is,
I don't know if I am worthy.

08:42.440 --> 08:44.730
Hm, I see.

08:45.690 --> 08:50.490
Well, then, let's find out
together how worthy you are.

08:52.580 --> 08:54.370
I will train you.

09:00.460 --> 09:04.800
The first thing you must learn is that
your weapon is an extension of yourself.

09:04.880 --> 09:08.130
You must think of it as
another part of your own body.

09:10.010 --> 09:11.390
Like a second head.

09:11.760 --> 09:16.520
Well, more like
an extra-long, really sharp arm.

09:16.600 --> 09:20.560
The sword is a simple tool,
but in the hands of a master

09:20.640 --> 09:26.360
it becomes the most versatile of weapons,
and just as the imagination is limitless

09:26.440 --> 09:29.700
so too are the possibilities
of the sword.

09:32.360 --> 09:33.700
AANG: What should we do today?

09:33.780 --> 09:34.990
I'm tapped out.

09:35.080 --> 09:36.990
I already picked my toes, twice.

09:37.080 --> 09:38.580
Twice?

09:38.660 --> 09:40.040
The first time was for cleaning,

09:40.120 --> 09:43.540
but the second time's just for
the sweet picking sensation.

09:44.090 --> 09:45.670
Sokka's been in charge
of the schedule.

09:45.750 --> 09:47.670
I'm not sure
what we should be doing.

09:47.760 --> 09:50.930

is calligraphy.

10:29.840 --> 10:31.420

10:31.920 --> 10:34.470
Writing my name will make me
a better swordsman?

10:34.590 --> 10:38.850
When you write your name,
you stamp the paper with your identity.

10:38.930 --> 10:43.230
You must learn to use your sword
to stamp your identity on a battlefield.

10:47.360 --> 10:53.200
Remember, you cannot take back a stroke of
the brush, or a stroke of the sword.

10:57.320 --> 10:59.490

on your face.

I am.

Choosing the correct material is the
most important step in crafting a sword.

15:06.780 --> 15:09.160
You must trust your steel
with your life.

15:09.240 --> 15:10.240
Choose carefully.

15:13.370 --> 15:15.670
( GRUNTING )

15:17.330 --> 15:19.170
Master, would it be possible for me to

15:19.250 --> 15:22.010
leave and bring back
a special material for my sword?

15:22.090 --> 15:24.340
I wouldn't have it
any other way.

15:27.640 --> 15:29.600
- Sokka's coming.
-( GASPING )

15:29.680 --> 15:31.140
Hey, guys.
What are you doing?

15:31.220 --> 15:32.640
AANG: Sokka?
TOPH: You're back.

15:32.720 --> 15:34.440
We missed you so much.

15:34.940 --> 15:36.350
Say something funny.

15:36.440 --> 15:37.900
Funny how?

15:37.980 --> 15:40.150
( LAUGHING )

15:40.770 --> 15:41.980
What's their deal?

15:42.110 --> 15:43.320
I don't know.

15:43.440 --> 15:45.070
They missed you or something.

15:45.150 --> 15:46.740
I didn't care.

15:46.820 --> 15:49.200
Thanks.
That warms my heart.

15:49.320 --> 15:50.700
Anyway, I need some help.

16:05.670 --> 16:07.890
( BREATHING HEAVILY )

16:26.820 --> 16:27.860
Who's this?

16:27.950 --> 16:29.780
Oh, these are my friends.

16:29.870 --> 16:31.870
Just other good
Fire Nation folks.

16:33.080 --> 16:35.750
Do you think we can make
a sword out of a meteorite?

16:36.540 --> 16:40.170
We'll make a sword unlike
any other in the world.

17:38.230 --> 17:42.400
Sokka, when you first arrived,
you were so unsure.

17:42.480 --> 17:45.190
You even seemed
down on yourself.

17:45.270 --> 17:47.860
But I saw something
in you right away.

17:47.990 --> 17:52.660
I saw a heart as strong as
a lion turtle, and twice as big

17:52.740 --> 17:56.990
and as we trained, it wasn't
your skills that impressed me.

17:57.080 --> 18:00.710
No, it certainly
wasn't your skills.

18:01.960 --> 18:05.130
You showed something
beyond that.

18:05.840 --> 18:10.090
Creativity, versatility,
intelligence.

18:10.170 --> 18:13.590
These are the traits
that define a great swordsman

18:13.680 --> 18:17.430
and these are the traits
that define you.

18:17.510 --> 18:21.730
You told me you didn't know
if you were worthy

18:21.850 --> 18:27.730
but I believe that you are more worthy
than any man I have ever trained.

18:30.780 --> 18:32.360
I'm sorry, master.

18:32.450 --> 18:33.490
You're wrong.

18:33.610 --> 18:35.820
I am not worthy.

18:36.030 --> 18:37.660
I'm not who you think I am.

18:37.780 --> 18:38.870
I'm not from the Fire Nation.

18:38.990 --> 18:41.290
I'm from the Southern
Water Tribe.

18:41.370 --> 18:44.040
I lied so that I could
learn swordsmanship from you.

18:44.880 --> 18:45.960
I'm sorry.

18:47.250 --> 18:49.420
I'm sorry, too.

18:49.500 --> 18:51.210
( GASPING )

18:52.590 --> 18:56.640
No, this is my fight, alone.

19:00.600 --> 19:03.350
You used to be
the pride of the Fire Nation.

19:03.480 --> 19:06.230
Our top general,
The Dragon of the West.

19:06.360 --> 19:10.070
Now, look at you.

19:10.820 --> 19:12.110
Look what you've become.

19:23.830 --> 19:24.920
( GRUNTING )

19:48.730 --> 19:51.820
( GRUNTING )

20:05.370 --> 20:07.210
PIANDAO: Excellent.

20:07.290 --> 20:09.290
Using your superior agility
against an older opponent.

20:09.420 --> 20:10.630
Smart.

20:15.590 --> 20:17.300
( GRUNTING )

20:27.770 --> 20:29.150
PIANDAO: Good use of terrain.

20:29.230 --> 20:30.400
Fighting from the high ground.

20:35.860 --> 20:37.150
( GRUNTING )

20:56.050 --> 20:58.630
Yes, use your surroundings.

20:58.760 --> 21:00.510
Make them fight for you.

21:01.890 --> 21:03.390
( SCREAMING )

21:03.470 --> 21:05.430
( PANTING )

21:10.690 --> 21:11.730
( GRUNTING )

21:15.110 --> 21:16.570
( COUGHING )

21:17.780 --> 21:19.740
Very resourceful.

21:48.480 --> 21:50.020
Excellent work, Sokka.

21:58.190 --> 22:01.570
I think I'm a little old
to be fighting the Avatar.

22:03.160 --> 22:04.450
How did you know?

22:04.620 --> 22:06.280
Oh, I've been around a while.

22:06.410 --> 22:08.160
You pick things up.

22:08.290 --> 22:10.830
Of course, I knew from the beginning
that Sokka was Water Tribe.

22:11.670 --> 22:15.210
You might want to think of
a better Fire Nation cover name.

22:15.290 --> 22:16.500
Try "Lee."

22:16.630 --> 22:18.760
There's a million Lees.

22:18.840 --> 22:22.010
But why would you agree
to train someone from the water tribe?

22:22.090 --> 22:25.220
The way of the sword doesn't
belong to any one nation.

22:25.300 --> 22:28.060
Knowledge of the arts
belongs to us all.

22:31.430 --> 22:36.770
Sokka, you must continue
your training on your own.

22:36.940 --> 22:40.740
If you stay on this path,
I know that one day

22:40.820 --> 22:43.820
you will become an even
greater master than I am.

22:52.580 --> 22:54.580
Wait.

22:55.130 --> 22:59.630
The master wanted you to have this,
as something to remember him by.

23:06.390 --> 23:07.930
It's a Pai Sho tile.

23:08.010 --> 23:09.930
AANG: The White Lotus.
Hm.

23:10.020 --> 23:11.310
KATARA: What does it mean?

23:11.390 --> 23:12.850
I have no idea.

23:16.230 --> 23:17.860
Ooh, that reminds me.

23:17.940 --> 23:19.480
Toph, I thought
you might like this

23:19.570 --> 23:22.240
Since you've probably never had a chance
to bend space earth before.

23:23.070 --> 23:24.240
Sweet.

23:26.410 --> 23:27.700
Check this out.

23:30.370 --> 23:32.750
You know, I don't think there's
such a thing as "space earth."

23:32.830 --> 23:35.710
If it's from space,
then it's not really earth.

23:35.790 --> 23:37.540
SOKKA: Must you ruin everything?

23:37.630 --> 23:39.710
KATARA: I can't believe
I missed you.

23:46.930 --> 23:50.350
( â™ª... )
