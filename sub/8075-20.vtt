00:03.704 --> 00:08.076
[music playing]

00:08.109 --> 00:10.244
What a great way to
end an incredible week.

00:10.278 --> 00:11.745
The movie was terrific.

00:11.779 --> 00:13.547
That was the longest you've
ever let me use the armrest.

00:25.526 --> 00:26.994
You did eat some
of my Milk Duds.

00:30.731 --> 00:33.901
Oh, I love this time of day.

00:33.934 --> 00:35.769
Yeah, it's pretty.

00:35.803 --> 00:37.638
You know, you can say what
you want about the sulfides

00:37.671 --> 00:39.740
from the paper mill, but it sure
makes for a beautiful sunset.

00:42.610 --> 00:44.044
Hey, have I thanked
you enough for helping

00:44.078 --> 00:45.946
me get that job in Chicago?

00:45.979 --> 00:48.549
Yes, David.

00:48.582 --> 00:50.418
We got a great
apartment, right?

00:50.451 --> 00:52.019
I mean, I'm so
psyched to see it.

00:52.052 --> 00:53.421
Oh, you're going
to love your room,

00:53.454 --> 00:55.089
except I'm going to have to get
in there every morning to brush

00:55.123 --> 00:55.923
my teeth.

00:59.627 --> 01:00.894
There's so much
to think about.

01:00.928 --> 01:03.697
I mean, should we
each buy our own food?

01:03.731 --> 01:05.133
Should we split the utilities?

01:05.166 --> 01:07.601
Should we have
separate phone lines?

01:07.635 --> 01:12.373
You know, or we
could just get married.

01:12.406 --> 01:14.708
[laughs] Yeah, right.

01:14.742 --> 01:15.543
To who?

01:18.546 --> 01:20.614
David.

01:20.648 --> 01:24.017
You're serious about
this, aren't you?

01:24.051 --> 01:24.918
Yeah.

01:24.952 --> 01:27.588
I am.

01:27.621 --> 01:28.422
Oh my God.

01:36.897 --> 01:38.266
Wait a minute.
A-ha.

01:38.299 --> 01:39.467
OK.

01:39.500 --> 01:41.235
Now you're going to tell
me you're kidding, right?

01:41.269 --> 01:45.206
Nope, now I'm going to
tell you I'm pregnant.

01:45.239 --> 01:47.608
[music - "roseanne theme"]

02:26.814 --> 02:29.283
[roseanne laughing]

02:29.317 --> 02:32.186
[music playing]

02:34.322 --> 02:35.956
Pregnant?

02:35.989 --> 02:40.961
You mean, like, pregnant?
- Yes, David.

02:40.994 --> 02:41.795
You've knocked me up.

02:44.232 --> 02:45.098
How?

02:45.132 --> 02:47.968
When?

02:48.001 --> 02:49.337
When?

02:49.370 --> 02:50.170
Disney World.

02:52.540 --> 02:53.574
Oh my God.

02:53.607 --> 02:55.142
You mean that night
after the fireworks?

02:55.175 --> 02:57.445
Well, either that, or it
truly is a magic kingdom.

03:04.852 --> 03:05.653
Wow.

03:08.689 --> 03:10.324
What are we going to do?

03:10.358 --> 03:11.459
Oh, don't worry.

03:11.492 --> 03:12.926
You know, getting
married and having a baby

03:12.960 --> 03:16.129
can't change things that much.

03:16.163 --> 03:17.598
I kind of wanted a dog first.

03:20.468 --> 03:22.303
Oh, it'll be OK.

03:22.336 --> 03:23.737
I'm still going
to finish school.

03:23.771 --> 03:26.240
And by getting married, I can
get on your health coverage,

03:26.274 --> 03:28.442
our car insurance will
go down, we'll be in line

03:28.476 --> 03:30.411
for married student housing.

03:30.444 --> 03:33.146
I mean, it just makes
sense, you know?

03:33.180 --> 03:34.448
Wouldn't have to be a big dog.

03:36.917 --> 03:38.151
Come on.

03:38.185 --> 03:40.288
Let's go tell everybody
inside and get this over with.

03:40.321 --> 03:41.922
Whoa, whoa, slow down.

03:41.955 --> 03:45.192
You mean-- you mean
tell everyone in there?

03:45.225 --> 03:47.928
Uh, Darlene, couldn't we--
couldn't we wait a few months?

03:47.961 --> 03:49.797
I mean, then they would just
think you were getting fat.

03:49.830 --> 03:51.198
They've got to be
expecting that.

03:51.231 --> 03:52.099
All right.

03:52.132 --> 03:54.034
We don't have to tell them yet.

03:54.067 --> 03:57.204
Now, take a deep breath and
try not to look so pasty.

03:57.237 --> 03:59.139
We'll just-- we'll tell
them the movie we just

03:59.172 --> 04:03.411
saw affected me profoundly.

04:03.444 --> 04:04.312
OK, let's go inside.

04:04.345 --> 04:05.212
You ready?

04:05.245 --> 04:07.648
[david laughs nervously]

04:07.681 --> 04:09.617
After you, Daddy.

04:09.650 --> 04:10.451
Oh.

04:13.954 --> 04:15.022
What the hell are those?

04:18.492 --> 04:20.594
Hey, you guys are
just in time for dinner.

04:20.628 --> 04:21.662
Grab a plate.

04:21.695 --> 04:23.564
Sit down here, David.

04:23.597 --> 04:24.465
Next to you?

04:24.498 --> 04:25.299
Yeah.

04:27.501 --> 04:32.005
Come tell me about your new
job as a graphic artist there.

04:32.039 --> 04:35.075
David, congratulations
on the job.

04:35.108 --> 04:38.011
Is it on computer, or
you just draw by hand?

04:38.045 --> 04:38.912
Uh, thanks.

04:38.946 --> 04:41.515
I'm fine.

04:41.549 --> 04:45.719
[blows raspberries] I
guess you're pretty excited

04:45.753 --> 04:48.656
about moving to Chicago, huh?

04:48.689 --> 04:50.491
Uh-huh.

04:50.524 --> 04:52.192
Course, it means I'll
have to move to Chicago.

04:55.363 --> 04:58.832
Oh, I'm confused.

04:58.866 --> 05:00.601
They're some kind
of tiny chicken.

05:00.634 --> 05:01.802
We didn't know what
they were, either.

05:05.072 --> 05:06.840
No I don't think
that's it, DJ.

05:06.874 --> 05:10.110
David's just a little
excited about his new job.

05:10.143 --> 05:12.646
Isn't that right, David?

05:12.680 --> 05:14.848
The movie affected
me profoundly.

05:19.720 --> 05:21.054
David, why don't
you let me sit there.

05:21.088 --> 05:22.656
You've been hogging
Mom long enough.

05:22.690 --> 05:23.891
OK, good, here.

05:28.462 --> 05:30.431
Uh, but you should
sit somewhere, you know?

05:39.206 --> 05:41.575
What's up?

05:41.609 --> 05:42.810
I smell fear.

05:42.843 --> 05:46.480
I love that smell,
but what's up?

05:46.514 --> 05:47.848
Nothing's up.
God.

05:47.881 --> 05:49.049
Hey, DJ, that's a great shirt.

05:49.082 --> 05:50.418
Where'd you get it?

05:50.451 --> 05:51.251
My closet.

05:54.121 --> 05:56.957
Oh, no, I think
something is up.

05:56.990 --> 05:58.826
Yeah, I've seen
enough of that Murder

05:58.859 --> 06:01.962
She Wrote to figure that out.

06:01.995 --> 06:03.263
Let's see here.

06:03.296 --> 06:07.300
David is pale and kind of
weak-kneed and all nervous,

06:07.334 --> 06:08.469
so there's no clues there.

06:12.039 --> 06:14.975
But Darlene wants
to sit next to me,

06:15.008 --> 06:16.977
and she said something
nice to her brother.

06:17.010 --> 06:19.012
Ooh, I wonder?

06:19.046 --> 06:19.913
I know.

06:19.947 --> 06:20.814
You're pregnant.

06:20.848 --> 06:26.253
[laughs]

06:26.286 --> 06:29.122
[dan, jackie, and dj laugh]

06:40.501 --> 06:42.470
That was my joke guess!

06:46.006 --> 06:47.374
We're also getting married.

06:54.181 --> 06:54.982
Well.

07:06.226 --> 07:09.429
I'm-- I'm-- I'm
excited for you guys.

07:09.463 --> 07:10.363
I think it's great.

07:10.397 --> 07:12.299
Dan!

07:12.332 --> 07:14.067
We're gonna be grandparents.

07:14.101 --> 07:15.368
Isn't that great?

07:15.402 --> 07:16.637
I'm getting one of
those sweatshirts

07:16.670 --> 07:19.673
that says World's Greatest
Grandma on it, you know?

07:19.707 --> 07:21.174
And you can go out
and get yourself,

07:21.208 --> 07:24.077
I don't know, like
a cane or something.

07:24.111 --> 07:26.647
Yeah.

07:26.680 --> 07:28.649
Oh, boy.

07:28.682 --> 07:29.783
Good, good, good, good, good.

07:32.553 --> 07:33.487
Wow.

07:33.521 --> 07:34.922
Thanks, Mrs. Conner.

07:34.955 --> 07:37.958
Really wasn't the
reaction I was expecting.

07:37.991 --> 07:39.026
Yeah, me neither.

07:39.059 --> 07:40.127
I guess you peed your
pants for nothing.

07:45.999 --> 07:47.968
Dan.

07:48.001 --> 07:48.869
Dan.

07:48.902 --> 07:50.337
What?

07:50.370 --> 07:52.573
Oh, I'm just trying
to figure out how

07:52.606 --> 07:56.143
to go about eating this thing.

07:56.176 --> 08:06.754
Well, I think it's good that
Darlene is getting pregnant,

08:06.787 --> 08:07.655
'cause--

08:07.688 --> 08:09.823
getting married,
'cause she has--

08:09.857 --> 08:14.027
she's pregnant, and, uh,
that's just what I did.

08:14.061 --> 08:18.999
[laughs nervously]

08:19.032 --> 08:21.201
DJ, stop staring at me.

08:21.234 --> 08:22.202
Oh.

08:22.235 --> 08:23.370
Babies having babies.

08:27.941 --> 08:29.242
Well, I'm nauseous.

08:29.276 --> 08:30.477
I was wondering when
that would hit me.

08:34.915 --> 08:36.584
What the hell
is wrong with you?

08:36.617 --> 08:37.651
What do you mean?

08:37.685 --> 08:40.220
What-- Roseanne,
Darlene says that she--

08:40.253 --> 08:41.855
she has to get married
because she's pregnant,

08:41.889 --> 08:43.256
and all you can say
is that you're happy?

08:43.290 --> 08:44.091
Are you insane?

08:47.027 --> 08:47.895
Jackie?

08:47.928 --> 08:49.496
DJ?

08:49.529 --> 08:52.465
Maybe it'd be best
if you left now.

08:52.499 --> 08:55.068
Okey doke.

08:55.102 --> 08:56.403
What about my little chicken?

08:56.436 --> 08:57.738
He's going to get cold.

08:57.771 --> 08:58.672
Get

08:58.706 --> 08:59.640
We're eating him in the car.

09:06.614 --> 09:09.617
What are you going
to say to me, Dan?

09:09.650 --> 09:12.820
Well, the only reason I didn't
start yelling is 'cause I was

09:12.853 --> 09:14.421
waiting for you, and you
didn't start yelling,

09:14.454 --> 09:16.556
and it's too late now.

09:19.760 --> 09:22.329
Well, that's 'cause it's
happened, and there's nothing

09:22.362 --> 09:23.463
we can do about it.

09:23.496 --> 09:24.865
Yeah.

09:24.898 --> 09:27.701
So what?

09:27.735 --> 09:28.969
Let's be happy?

09:29.002 --> 09:30.337
Why not.

09:30.370 --> 09:33.573
Our daughter's
throwing her life away.

09:33.607 --> 09:36.143
Well, no, actually, I think
we're making a little progress

09:36.176 --> 09:37.778
in this family.

09:37.811 --> 09:40.180
Becky got married
when she was 17.

09:40.213 --> 09:41.715
I was only 18.

09:41.749 --> 09:44.351
At last, a Conner woman
is mature enough to put

09:44.384 --> 09:48.088
it off 'til she's 19 years old.

09:48.121 --> 09:50.490
No way are they
ready to have a baby.

09:50.523 --> 09:53.727
No way.

09:53.761 --> 09:55.929
Well, I don't know.

09:55.963 --> 09:59.667
I can't think of a better
mother for a child than David.

10:05.472 --> 10:06.473
I can't believe it.

10:06.506 --> 10:07.908
You're not even shocked by this.

10:07.941 --> 10:10.778
I mean, what is it
with this family?

10:10.811 --> 10:11.945
Nothing can ever be easy.

10:11.979 --> 10:14.147
Nothing ever goes the
way it's supposed to.

10:14.181 --> 10:15.548
I think you better
just calm down.

10:15.582 --> 10:16.449
No.

10:16.483 --> 10:18.051
Why should I calm down, dammit?

10:18.085 --> 10:21.855
Because we can be angry,
and that will have no effect

10:21.889 --> 10:24.591
whatsoever, or we can be
happy, and that will have

10:24.624 --> 10:27.027
no effect whatsoever either.

10:27.060 --> 10:29.396
So why don't we just be
parents and support 'em?

10:32.499 --> 10:34.868
[music playing]

10:52.886 --> 10:54.221
You're pretty mad
at me, aren't you?

10:54.254 --> 10:56.223
Nope.

10:56.256 --> 10:59.492
Well, you're chewing
like you're mad.

10:59.526 --> 11:00.794
Sorry.

11:00.828 --> 11:01.661
I'll try to chew happier.

11:13.006 --> 11:14.474
Mr. Conner, I
know this whole me

11:14.507 --> 11:16.810
and Darlene thing
is very, very weird,

11:16.844 --> 11:19.112
especially after all you've been
through with Mark and Becky.

11:19.146 --> 11:19.980
But--

11:20.013 --> 11:20.848
But you want it
to be different.

11:20.881 --> 11:21.915
Fine.
OK, whatever.

11:35.128 --> 11:36.764
So how mad are you?

11:36.797 --> 11:38.265
I'm pretty damn mad.

11:38.298 --> 11:42.135
From now on, people are eating
straight out of the pan.

11:42.169 --> 11:44.504
So you're OK about this
whole me and Darlene thing?

11:44.537 --> 11:46.439
I mean, I know you said you
were, but so did Mr. Conner,

11:46.473 --> 11:48.308
and he's obviously not.

11:48.341 --> 11:50.643
Yeah, pretty weird, huh?

11:50.677 --> 11:52.712
Ever since I've had
that baby, I don't know.

11:52.746 --> 11:54.081
Things don't bother me as much.

11:54.114 --> 11:56.416
I'm just happier.

11:56.449 --> 11:59.787
You're a lucky,
lucky boy, David.

11:59.820 --> 12:00.754
Thanks, Mrs. Conner.

12:00.788 --> 12:02.222
Yeah.

12:02.255 --> 12:03.891
I'll tell you how you
handle Mr. Conner.

12:03.924 --> 12:05.292
You just stay on his right side.

12:05.325 --> 12:06.226
That's his blind spot.

12:09.696 --> 12:12.866
So how are you doing, David?

12:12.900 --> 12:15.102
OK, I guess.

12:15.135 --> 12:18.806
It's kind of interesting having
all of your major life changes

12:18.839 --> 12:20.707
happen in one day.

12:20.740 --> 12:23.076
Yeah, I think I can pretty
much relate to that.

12:23.110 --> 12:28.882
I remember this one Tuesday,
they canceled Card Sharks,

12:28.916 --> 12:33.220
and, uh, they introduced the
chocolate chip cookie dough

12:33.253 --> 12:36.123
ice cream the very same day.

12:36.156 --> 12:36.957
Whoa.

12:39.960 --> 12:43.263
You worried about the baby?

12:43.296 --> 12:47.534
Actually, I'm more worried
about me and Darlene.

12:47.567 --> 12:53.273
Something's just-- I don't know.

12:53.306 --> 12:54.707
When she asked me to marry her--

12:54.741 --> 12:56.176
Oh, she asked you?

12:56.209 --> 12:59.179
That's cute.

12:59.212 --> 13:00.113
No.

13:00.147 --> 13:02.715
No, Mrs. Conner, it wasn't cute.

13:02.749 --> 13:04.551
I felt like she was
proposing some sort

13:04.584 --> 13:06.854
of business deal or something.

13:06.887 --> 13:09.522
Had nothing to do with love.

13:09.556 --> 13:12.092
Well, then, I'm impressed.

13:12.125 --> 13:17.097
That means Darlene knows what
marriage is really all about.

13:17.130 --> 13:18.231
Oh, David, come on.

13:18.265 --> 13:19.666
You know she loves you.

13:22.602 --> 13:25.105
Maybe it's just that
I pictured it different.

13:25.138 --> 13:26.806
I mean, I thought I
would tell Darlene

13:26.840 --> 13:30.377
I had a big surprise for her,
and we would hop in the car

13:30.410 --> 13:33.313
and drive down to that underpass
near Route 10 where we first--

13:39.586 --> 13:41.488
I'm just-- I'm not sure
that this is how we

13:41.521 --> 13:43.756
should be starting a marriage.

13:43.790 --> 13:47.060
Oh, David.

13:47.094 --> 13:48.328
You know, this is--

13:48.361 --> 13:52.866
granted, it's a lot to
handle, you know, all at once.

13:52.900 --> 13:57.437
But I'm sure Darlene, you
know, has got a lot of things

13:57.470 --> 13:58.838
going through her mind, too.

13:58.872 --> 14:02.642
And you guys are going
to work it all out.

14:02.675 --> 14:04.177
Everything'll be OK, David.

14:15.322 --> 14:16.423
- Hey.
- Hi.

14:16.456 --> 14:17.557
How are you doing?

14:17.590 --> 14:18.458
Pregnant.

14:18.491 --> 14:20.627
How about you?

14:20.660 --> 14:21.828
You want something to eat?

14:21.861 --> 14:25.232
Can I make you a peanut
butter and Frito sandwich?

14:25.265 --> 14:26.433
That's OK, Mom.

14:26.466 --> 14:28.868
I'm not really craving
weird pregnancy food yet.

14:28.902 --> 14:29.869
No.

14:29.903 --> 14:31.004
I was making it for me.

14:31.038 --> 14:32.272
You want one?

14:32.305 --> 14:33.106
Sure.

14:35.242 --> 14:36.109
Here.

14:36.143 --> 14:36.944
Have this one.

14:44.784 --> 14:47.187
You're staring.

14:47.220 --> 14:50.823
It's so bizarre that
you're going to be a mother.

14:50.857 --> 14:51.959
Yeah, well, it
won't be official

14:51.992 --> 14:52.926
'til I chew through the cord.

14:57.830 --> 14:59.132
You aren't going
to believe the stuff

14:59.166 --> 15:00.533
it's going to do to your body.

15:00.567 --> 15:01.834
Of course, you know,
I'm going to be

15:01.868 --> 15:04.504
there beside you the whole
time, laughing and pointing.

15:14.214 --> 15:16.383
No, but you really,
really are not

15:16.416 --> 15:18.585
going to believe the way
everything's going to change,

15:18.618 --> 15:19.719
you know?

15:19.752 --> 15:22.889
The way stuff smells,
even the way it tastes.

15:22.922 --> 15:24.224
Like when I was
pregnant with Becky,

15:24.257 --> 15:28.028
I had a craving to eat dirt.

15:28.061 --> 15:29.096
Get out.

15:29.129 --> 15:30.630
Then when I was
pregnant with you,

15:30.663 --> 15:33.866
I couldn't get enough
of your dad's smell.

15:33.900 --> 15:42.075
That intoxicating blend of motor
oil, Aqua Velva, and corn nuts.

15:42.109 --> 15:43.510
Way too much detail.

15:47.680 --> 15:51.651
So I'm assuming that you
have considered all the options

15:51.684 --> 15:54.754
open to you, you know, having
to do with the pregnancy

15:54.787 --> 15:56.256
and everything.
- Yeah.

15:56.289 --> 15:57.157
I know the options.

15:59.892 --> 16:02.595
And?

16:02.629 --> 16:03.696
And I want the baby.

16:03.730 --> 16:05.598
I want it more than I've
ever wanted anything.

16:05.632 --> 16:08.135
Is that so hard to believe?

16:08.168 --> 16:10.370
Well, yeah, a little bit.

16:10.403 --> 16:12.105
I mean, I remember
when you were eight

16:12.139 --> 16:13.506
and you wanted to
get a vasectomy.

16:17.010 --> 16:19.012
And then even after we
told you what it was,

16:19.046 --> 16:19.846
you still wanted one.

16:22.849 --> 16:25.018
Yeah, well, I'm not eight
anymore, and I want the baby.

16:25.052 --> 16:27.220
So let's just drop it, OK?
- OK.

16:27.254 --> 16:28.688
Fine.

16:28.721 --> 16:30.790
You're having a baby and
you're getting married.

16:30.823 --> 16:31.858
Cool.

16:31.891 --> 16:33.026
Not gonna say another
thing about it.

16:36.796 --> 16:39.966
Do you have any idea what a
mega amount of crap that's going

16:39.999 --> 16:41.234
to be to deal with, Darlene?

16:41.268 --> 16:42.902
Are you ready for that?

16:42.935 --> 16:44.904
Mom, why are you
doing this to me?

16:44.937 --> 16:46.373
I mean, do you think
there's a single thing

16:46.406 --> 16:47.474
that you could
say that I haven't

16:47.507 --> 16:49.209
thought about like 1,000 times?

16:49.242 --> 16:51.044
Well, you know, you'll
have to excuse me.

16:51.078 --> 16:53.413
I might be in a little
bit of shock here.

16:53.446 --> 16:54.747
I know.

16:54.781 --> 16:56.583
I know everybody's looking
at me and thinking, like, oh,

16:56.616 --> 16:58.185
Darlene's getting married?

16:58.218 --> 16:59.552
Darlene's gonna have a baby?

16:59.586 --> 17:02.189
I mean, hell, even I said it.

17:02.222 --> 17:04.824
But you know, when I
found out that there

17:04.857 --> 17:07.927
was, like, this life going
through me, I don't know,

17:07.960 --> 17:08.828
I just--

17:08.861 --> 17:11.364
I feel, like, different.

17:11.398 --> 17:12.265
Happier.

17:12.299 --> 17:15.102
[laughs]

17:15.135 --> 17:18.271
Yeah, well, you know, I know
all about that euphoria thing.

17:18.305 --> 17:20.740
I've had four children.

17:20.773 --> 17:21.674
Felt that three times.

17:24.444 --> 17:25.778
I don't know.

17:25.812 --> 17:29.682
It's just like life is not as
hard as I made it out to be.

17:29.716 --> 17:35.388
Yeah, well, having a baby
is really hard under the very

17:35.422 --> 17:37.190
best of circumstances, Darlene.

17:37.224 --> 17:39.859
You've got a really
tough road ahead of you.

17:39.892 --> 17:41.861
I know that, and that's
why I'm preparing for it now.

17:41.894 --> 17:43.530
I mean, you know,
with summer school,

17:43.563 --> 17:45.098
I can still graduate on time.

17:45.132 --> 17:47.767
And David's got a full-time
job, so the baby'll

17:47.800 --> 17:49.136
be covered on his insurance.

17:49.169 --> 17:51.171
And I just put in
for a copywriting job

17:51.204 --> 17:52.805
that I can do part-time at home.

17:56.309 --> 17:58.845
Hm.

17:58.878 --> 18:01.914
Sounds like you're more
prepared than I ever was.

18:01.948 --> 18:03.350
Yeah, I mean,
and to be honest,

18:03.383 --> 18:05.852
I couldn't do any of this if
we weren't getting married.

18:05.885 --> 18:08.087
And there's a lot of
benefits that come with that.

18:08.121 --> 18:10.022
Besides, you know, I love
David, so it's not like this--

18:10.056 --> 18:11.391
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
OK.

18:11.424 --> 18:15.195
You know that last little part
there about you love David?

18:15.228 --> 18:17.630
You know?

18:17.664 --> 18:20.233
You better go find
him and tell him that.

18:20.267 --> 18:22.535
[laughs] David
knows that I love him.

18:22.569 --> 18:23.903
No, Darlene.

18:23.936 --> 18:29.542
I was talking to him, and he
really needs to hear that, OK?

18:29.576 --> 18:32.412
OK.

18:32.445 --> 18:34.147
Hey, I want you to
know something else, too.

18:36.949 --> 18:41.688
You know, I am, you know,
totally happy for you,

18:41.721 --> 18:43.223
and I'm going to
be here for you.

18:45.958 --> 18:49.229
Do not start to cry.

18:49.262 --> 18:51.063
Well, I mean,
it is pretty cool,

18:51.097 --> 18:53.065
you know, seeing my
little baby a grown-up

18:53.099 --> 18:54.834
and responsible woman.

19:03.109 --> 19:05.412
So go find your fiance.

19:08.248 --> 19:09.682
Woo.

19:09.716 --> 19:12.552
[music playing]

19:17.557 --> 19:21.394
So I figure it was on the tram
somewhere between the Dumbo

19:21.428 --> 19:24.797
ride and the Alien Encounter.

19:24.831 --> 19:26.433
Not funny, Roseanne.

19:26.466 --> 19:27.500
Oh, come on, Dan.

19:27.534 --> 19:30.970
Our daughter got
pregnant at Disney World.

19:31.003 --> 19:32.405
When else you get the
chance to put that

19:32.439 --> 19:36.108
in your Christmas newsletter?

19:36.142 --> 19:38.278
You know, I always figured
Darlene was going to make it,

19:38.311 --> 19:40.347
Rosie.

19:40.380 --> 19:41.448
You know?

19:41.481 --> 19:44.251
I thought Darlene was
going to be the one.

19:44.284 --> 19:47.554
It's her last year of
college, all these big job

19:47.587 --> 19:49.088
offers, and now this.

19:49.121 --> 19:50.657
She's still going
to make it, Dan.

19:50.690 --> 19:52.792
She'll just have big
bags under her eyes

19:52.825 --> 19:55.094
and Cheerios in her hair.

19:55.127 --> 19:57.330
It's not what
she planned, honey.

19:57.364 --> 19:58.565
It's Not what she wanted.

19:58.598 --> 19:59.366
It's not what I wanted for her.

19:59.399 --> 20:00.567
OK.

20:00.600 --> 20:02.134
Well, I was out there
talking to her, you know,

20:02.168 --> 20:03.936
and she, like, totally
blew my mind, Dan.

20:03.970 --> 20:06.172
She's thought it all through.

20:06.205 --> 20:08.074
She's got it all planned out.

20:08.107 --> 20:11.110
Yeah, I know, but they're
not ready to have kids.

20:11.143 --> 20:12.979
Couldn't they have waited
'til they had some more money?

20:13.012 --> 20:15.181
'Til they had any money.

20:15.214 --> 20:18.117
Well, if we would have
waited 'til we had money, we

20:18.150 --> 20:21.454
never would have had any kids.

20:21.488 --> 20:23.623
And then who would we
have sent to the store

20:23.656 --> 20:24.791
to buy our cigarettes?

20:27.226 --> 20:28.595
Yeah.

20:28.628 --> 20:30.663
We also never would have had a
daughter who derailed her life

20:30.697 --> 20:32.432
because she did
something stupid.

20:32.465 --> 20:35.101
She's not stupid,
Dan, she's human.

20:35.134 --> 20:36.903
And we finally have
some proof of that.

20:36.936 --> 20:38.037
Oh, stop it, Roseanne.

20:38.070 --> 20:40.607
Our daughter's pregnant
and is getting married.

20:40.640 --> 20:43.610
I can't just sit back
and do nothing about it.

20:43.643 --> 20:45.312
OK, well, why don't
you start screaming

20:45.345 --> 20:48.415
and throwing furniture around
like you did when Becky eloped?

20:48.448 --> 20:51.551
And then we won't see her
for a year and a half, too.

20:51.584 --> 20:52.385
Yeah, well.

20:54.587 --> 20:55.588
She's going to make it, Dan.

20:55.622 --> 20:57.390
She's fine.

20:57.424 --> 20:58.257
We're going to be there.

20:58.291 --> 20:59.326
We're gonna help her through it.

20:59.359 --> 21:00.993
We're all going to make it.

21:01.027 --> 21:02.495
We are good parents, Dan.

21:05.898 --> 21:08.868
[sighs] Check this out.

21:12.639 --> 21:16.809
Not only-- not only are we
going to have a grandchild who

21:16.843 --> 21:19.245
is roughly the same
age as our own child,

21:19.278 --> 21:24.517
but our daughter is marrying the
boy we consider to be our son.

21:30.490 --> 21:32.959
I think that means
that we are now

21:32.992 --> 21:39.165
officially the white-trashiest
family in all the land.

21:43.770 --> 21:45.237
DAN: Yee-haw!
