00:02.790 --> 00:03.859
- WHAT PEOPLE DO.
THEY MOVE OUT.

00:03.960 --> 00:05.518
- NOT ALL PEOPLE.

00:05.620 --> 00:07.201

ARE GETTING MARRIED.

00:07.310 --> 00:09.244
- ISN'T THAT EXCITING?
- I SLEPT WITH SOMEONE.

00:09.350 --> 00:10.863

FOR THIS.

00:10.970 --> 00:12.073
- HOW'D YOU GET HOOKED UP
WITH THE BABY?

00:12.180 --> 00:13.863
- THERE IS A YOUNG WOMAN.

00:13.970 --> 00:15.380
SHE WORKS AT THE COFFEE CART.

00:15.490 --> 00:16.525

WITH HER OR SOMETHING?

00:16.630 --> 00:18.803

00:18.910 --> 00:22.494

00:26.710 --> 00:27.984
WHOA.

00:28.090 --> 00:29.603
I CAN'T.

00:31.850 --> 00:34.717
[Obel's Just So]

00:37.100 --> 00:42.891
BLACK TURNS

00:43.000 --> 00:44.934
TURNING ON THE LIGHT

00:45.040 --> 00:47.417
- YOU KNOW,
MAYBE WE SHOULD JUST DIG IN.

00:47.530 --> 00:49.077
- WHY DON'T WE WAIT
FIVE MORE MINUTES?

00:49.180 --> 00:50.693
- I CAN TRY HIM AGAIN.

00:50.800 --> 00:52.244
I'LL JUST TRY HIM AGAIN.

00:52.360 --> 00:54.692
- YOU HEAR SOMEBODY SAY

00:54.810 --> 01:00.112
WE NEED YOU RIGHT AWAY

01:00.230 --> 01:04.644

01:04.750 --> 01:07.059
I KNOW, BUT THEY MADE BREAKFAST
FOR US.

01:07.170 --> 01:09.024
NO, I KNOW, BUT...

01:09.130 --> 01:10.506
THAT'S NOT REALLY AN EXCUSE,
TROY.

01:10.620 --> 01:12.019
LOOK, BUT WHAT I'M--

01:12.140 --> 01:14.472

01:30.570 --> 01:32.219
OKAY?
HE'S GONNA SIGN THE PAPERS.

01:32.330 --> 01:35.322
I REALLY DON'T WANT YOU
TO WORRY ABOUT THAT.

01:35.440 --> 01:38.364
OKAY?

01:40.300 --> 01:41.574
- GOOD.
- IF YOU CAN JUST PASS THAT.

01:41.680 --> 01:42.988
- FRENCH TOAST.
- THAT'S THE ONE.

01:43.100 --> 01:45.648
- THAT'S THE ONE.

01:46.790 --> 01:48.894
- SHE KISSED YOU?

01:49.000 --> 01:50.228
YOU?
- YEAH.

01:50.350 --> 01:51.487
- SHE KISSED YOU?

01:51.590 --> 01:53.558
- YES. WHY IS THIS
SO SHOCKING TO YOU?

01:53.660 --> 01:54.934
- OHH.
[laughs]

01:55.040 --> 01:57.247
WELL, ONE,
BECAUSE IT'S YOU.

01:57.350 --> 01:59.932
AND, I MEAN, I KIND OF THOUGHT
SHE HAD A CRUSH ON ME.

02:00.050 --> 02:01.358
- OH, I SEE, I SEE.
IT'S ABOUT YOU.

02:01.460 --> 02:02.381
YOU'RE JEALOUS.
- HOLY CAN OF FISH.

02:02.500 --> 02:03.637
- THAT'S WHAT THIS IS ABOUT.

02:03.740 --> 02:05.048
IT'S GONNA BECOME ABOUT YOU.
- NO, NO.

02:05.150 --> 02:06.082
BELIEVE ME,
I'M NOT JEALOUS.

02:06.190 --> 02:07.396
I'M ELATED RIGHT NOW.
THIS IS FANTASTIC.

02:08.880 --> 02:10.256
ABOUT FLIRTING WITH HER,

02:10.370 --> 02:11.917
AND THEN YOU KISSED HER.
- SHE KISSED ME, CROSBY.

02:12.020 --> 02:12.987
LISTEN TO ME.
I DIDN'T KISS HER.

02:13.090 --> 02:15.024
OKAY?
- SHE KISSED YOUR NECK

02:15.130 --> 02:15.915
OR YOUR LIPS?
- CROSBY, CAN YOU JUST--

02:16.030 --> 02:16.951
- I'M SORRY.

02:17.060 --> 02:18.129
THIS IS VERY EXCITING.

02:18.240 --> 02:19.127
CHRISTMAS CAME EARLY.
- LISTEN TO ME.

02:19.240 --> 02:20.161
- YES.
- SHOULD I OR SHOULD I NOT

02:20.270 --> 02:21.259
TELL KRISTINA?

02:21.380 --> 02:23.439
- WELL, YEAH,
OF COURSE TELL KRISTINA.

02:23.550 --> 02:24.414
SHE'S GONNA LOVE THIS STORY.

02:24.520 --> 02:25.726
YOU CAN WALK HER
THROUGH WHY YOU WERE

02:25.830 --> 02:26.922
AT HER PLACE

02:27.040 --> 02:27.859
AND HOW SOFI'
HER LIPS WERE

02:27.970 --> 02:31.030
AND WHETHER OR NOT
YOU GOT AROUSED DOWNSTAIRS.

02:31.150 --> 02:32.139
AND SHE'S PROBABLY
FEELING GREAT

02:32.250 --> 02:33.933
ABOUT HERSELF RIGHT NOW
POST-BABY,

02:34.050 --> 02:35.836
SO I THINK
THIS WILL GO OVER GREAT.

02:35.940 --> 02:38.113
BUT YOU'LL BE GUILT-FREE
AND THEN SHE'LL SPIRAL

02:38.220 --> 02:39.494
INTO A DARK, DEEP DEPRESSION.

02:39.600 --> 02:40.703
- SO YOU'RE TELLING ME
I SHOULDN'T TELL HER?

02:40.810 --> 02:42.983
- OF COURSE
THAT'S WHAT I'M TELLING YOU.

02:43.090 --> 02:44.534
- LOOK, I TELL KRISTINA
EVERYTHING.

02:44.640 --> 02:46.289
- YOU SHOULD NOT TELL HER THIS.

02:46.400 --> 02:48.982
- I DON'T KNOW
IF I CAN NOT TELL HER, THOUGH.

02:49.090 --> 02:50.978
- WAS IT AWESOME?

02:51.100 --> 02:52.715
WHAT?
- GOD, THIS IS NOT THE POINT.

02:52.820 --> 02:54.469
OKAY?
I AM TRYING TO FIGURE THIS OUT.

02:54.580 --> 02:56.263
I CAN'T...
HEY, RACHEL.

02:56.380 --> 02:58.757
- HI.

03:08.700 --> 03:10.213
- WHY DON'T YOU POP
THE LID OFF FOR HIM?

03:10.320 --> 03:11.947
- YEAH, YEAH, I'M GOOD.

03:12.050 --> 03:13.358
- GREAT.

08:42.690 --> 08:45.158
- NO, HE'S NOT.
- I'M WORRIED.

08:45.280 --> 08:48.101
- I THOUGHT HE'D JUST FIGURE IT
OUT LIKE SANTA CLAUS.

08:48.210 --> 08:50.417
- WAIT A MINUTE, HE DOESN'T
BELIEVE IN SANTA CLAUS?

08:50.530 --> 08:52.009
CHRISTMAS IS RUIN ED.

08:52.110 --> 08:53.281
- NO, NO, NO.
NO, I MEAN, YOU KNOW

08:53.390 --> 08:54.618
HOW KIDS JUST ONE DAY

08:54.740 --> 08:56.458
FIGURE IT OUT ON THEIR OWN?
- OH, YEAH, YEAH.

08:56.570 --> 09:00.358
- YOU KNOW, AND I FIGURED HE'D
EVENTUALLY GET THAT, YOU KNOW,

09:00.470 --> 09:02.938
WE WEREN'T GETTING MARRIED.

09:06.640 --> 09:08.574
- SO DO YOU THINK
HE'S GOING TO FIGURE THAT OUT

09:08.680 --> 09:11.296
ON HIS OWN?
- NO.

09:11.410 --> 09:13.753
HE'S REALLY CONFUSED.

09:13.860 --> 09:15.896
AND I DON'T THINK
IT'S GOOD FOR HIM

09:16.000 --> 09:17.718
TO KEEP HOPING FOR SOMETHING

09:17.830 --> 09:20.890
THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

09:21.000 --> 09:23.343
SO I THINK THAT YOU AND I
SHOULD SIT HIM DOWN

09:23.450 --> 09:26.339
AND TELL HIM THE TRUTH.
- MM-HMM.

09:26.460 --> 09:30.453
WELL, UM...
I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT,

09:30.570 --> 09:32.356
AND I THINK
IT'S GOING TO SUCK.

09:32.460 --> 09:35.281
- YEAH.
- YEAH.

09:35.400 --> 09:39.439
SO MAYBE WE HAVE YOUR MOM DO IT.

09:39.540 --> 09:41.679
- [laughs]
- SHE LOVES GIVING BAD NEWS.

09:41.780 --> 09:43.577
IT'S HER SPECIALTY.

09:43.680 --> 09:47.434
[gentle music]

09:47.550 --> 09:49.233
[knock at door]

09:49.340 --> 09:52.229
- UH, YEAH.
- IT'S THE LANDLORD. OPEN UP.

09:52.350 --> 09:57.242
- UH, I'M IN--
I'M--I--CAN YOU COME BACK LATER?

09:57.350 --> 09:59.318
I'M KIND OF BUSY.
- COME ON.

09:59.420 --> 10:00.694
- COMING.

10:00.800 --> 10:03.360
- TODAY.
- I'M COMING. I'M COMING.

10:03.460 --> 10:05.519
HI. HOW HAIRE YOU?

10:05.630 --> 10:06.631
I'M FINE.
HOW ARE YOU?

10:06.740 --> 10:08.458
- I'M REALLY GOOD.
- GOOD.

10:08.570 --> 10:09.798
- HOW'S THE KIDS?
- YOU'RE $140 SHORT.

10:09.910 --> 10:11.081
- OH, NO, NO, NO.
- LAST MONTH

10:11.190 --> 10:12.634
YOU WERE TWO WEEKS LATE.

10:12.750 --> 10:13.978
THAT WAS THE EXCEPTION.

10:14.090 --> 10:16.320
GET THE $140 TO ME TOMORROW,
OR YOU ARE OUT.

10:16.440 --> 10:18.158
- W-W-W-W-WHOA.

10:18.270 --> 10:20.579
I CAN'T GET IT TO YOU,
YOU KNOW, TOMORROW.

10:20.680 --> 10:24.468
- TOMORROW.
NO IFS, BUTS, OR ANDS.

10:24.580 --> 10:25.547
- NO, NONE?
NONE OF THEM?

10:25.650 --> 10:27.959
- HASTA LA VISTA.
- HA-HA, BABY.

10:30.250 --> 10:34.619
- HEY, HON,
THINKING ABOUT DOING A CLEANSE.

10:34.730 --> 10:37.073
I GOT THIS BOOK TODAY,
AND I'M REALLY THINKING

10:37.180 --> 10:39.216
ABOUT JUST GETTING
ALL THE TOXINS OUT OF MY SYSTEM

10:39.320 --> 10:41.561
AND, LIKE, TRYING TO LOSE
THE REST OF THE BABY WEIGHT.

10:41.670 --> 10:43.706
I THINK I CAN DO IT
WHILE I'M BREAST-FEEDING,

10:43.810 --> 10:45.539
BUT I HAVE TO CHECK
WITH MY DOC.

10:45.640 --> 10:48.359
- RACHEL KISSED ME.

10:48.470 --> 10:50.847
AFTER I WENT INTO THE
LUNCHEONETTE THE OTHER NIGHT

10:50.960 --> 10:52.609
WHEN CROSBY SAID
IT WAS URGENT,

10:52.720 --> 10:55.928
AND IT WAS AFTER
THE MATH WARRIORS TOURNAMENT.

10:56.030 --> 10:58.089
IT WAS JUST OUT OF THE BLUE.
SHE JUST KISSED ME.

10:58.200 --> 11:00.202
IT WAS WEIRD.

11:00.310 --> 11:04.098
IT WAS THAT NIGHT THAT I WENT
INTO THE LUNCHEONETTE.

11:04.210 --> 11:06.519
I DEBATED WHETHER TO TELL YOU
BECAUSE IT DIDN'T MEAN ANYTHING,

11:06.630 --> 11:07.790
SO I DIDN'T WANT TO UPSET YOU,

11:07.900 --> 11:09.379
BUT ULTIMATELY
I WANT TO BE HONEST.

11:09.490 --> 11:11.799
SO...

11:11.910 --> 11:14.902
- RACHEL, THE GIRL THAT YOU
WORKED WITH, KISSED YOU?

11:15.010 --> 11:16.079
ON THE LIPS?
- YES.

11:16.190 --> 11:17.703
YES.

11:17.810 --> 11:20.938
- DID YOU KISS HER BACK?
- NO, NO, OF COURSE NOT.

11:21.050 --> 11:22.608
NO, I PUSHED HER OFF,
YOU KNOW.

11:22.710 --> 11:24.154
SHE KISSED ME,
AND I PUSHED HER OFF

11:24.260 --> 11:26.979
AND I LET HER KNOW
THAT THAT IS INAPPROPRIATE.

11:27.100 --> 11:28.601
YOU OKAY?

11:28.720 --> 11:32.542
- I ASSUME SHE'S LEAVING,
RIGHT?

11:32.650 --> 11:34.993
- YEAH.

11:35.100 --> 11:37.068
- YEAH.

11:42.590 --> 11:44.034
- LOVE

11:44.150 --> 11:47.176
I'LL BE YOUR MOONLIT NIGHT

11:47.290 --> 11:49.008
SO YOU'LL HAVE

11:49.120 --> 11:53.113
A LIFE IN THE SUN

11:53.220 --> 11:54.847
SO?

11:54.950 --> 11:58.226
- I LIKE THAT, BUT I THINK
I LIKE THE UKULELE MORE.

11:58.330 --> 12:00.264
I THINK WE SHOULD RECORD ONE
WITH THE UKULELE

12:00.370 --> 12:01.780
AND THEN YOU CAN LISTEN
AND SEE WHAT YOU THINK.

12:01.890 --> 12:03.164
SOUND GOOD?
- MM-HMM.

12:03.270 --> 12:05.158
- LET'S DO IT.

12:08.620 --> 12:10.201
HEY.
- HEY.

12:10.310 --> 12:12.130
[strumming ukulele]

12:12.240 --> 12:14.754
- HEY, LANDON, YOU'RE GOOD
ANYTIME YOU WANT.

12:21.490 --> 12:24.527
WHAT'S UP?

12:24.640 --> 12:26.016
WHAT IS IT?

12:26.120 --> 12:28.941
- WE HAVE TO FIRE RACHEL.

12:30.500 --> 12:31.603
- WHY?

12:31.710 --> 12:34.429
- CHILD, MY HEART
SKIPS A BEAT

12:34.540 --> 12:36.679
- I TOLD KRISTINA.

12:36.790 --> 12:37.814
- UH-HUH.

12:37.920 --> 12:39.478
- AND SHE...

12:39.580 --> 12:40.751
- I TOLD YOU
NOT TO TELL HER.

12:40.860 --> 12:41.997
- I KNOW YOU TOLD ME
NOT TO TELL HER,

12:42.100 --> 12:43.203
BUT I TOLD HER.
- WHAT DID I SAY?

12:43.310 --> 12:44.925
I KNEW THIS WOULD BE
THE OUTCOME.

12:45.040 --> 12:46.758
- KRISTINA OVERREACT ED,
AND NOW I GOT TO DEAL WITH IT.

12:46.860 --> 12:49.340
- BY FIRING RACHEL?
- I DON'T HAVE A CHOICE.

12:49.450 --> 12:51.133
- SOMEONE WHO'S COMPETENT
AND HARDWORKING

12:51.250 --> 12:52.763
AND AFFORDABLE?
- I KNOW THIS. I KNOW THIS.

12:52.870 --> 12:55.316
- SO SHE GETS HURT.
I MEAN, YOU HAD TO HAVE PLAYED

12:55.420 --> 12:56.626
SOME ROLE IN THIS.

12:56.740 --> 12:57.968
- WHAT THE HELL
IS THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

12:58.080 --> 12:59.001
- I'M SAYING
YOU MUST HAVE FLIRTED WITH HER.

12:59.120 --> 13:00.041
- I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

13:00.150 --> 13:01.048
I WAS NOT FLIRTING WITH HER.

13:01.150 --> 13:02.082
DON'T SAY THAT I WAS, OKAY,

13:02.190 --> 13:03.043
'CAUSE KRISTINA
WILL GO OFF THE DEEP END.

13:03.160 --> 13:04.013
- WELL, I FIND IT
VERY HARD TO BELIEVE

13:04.120 --> 13:05.917
THAT A HOT YOUNG GIRL
JUST ATTACKED

13:06.020 --> 13:07.294
AN OLD DUDE,
I'M SORRY.

13:07.400 --> 13:08.196
- OLD DUDE?
- I FIND THAT VERY DIFFICULT--

13:08.300 --> 13:09.153
- YOU KNOW WHAT,
HERE'S WHAT HAPPENED.

13:09.270 --> 13:10.259
- YOU'RE AN OLD DUDE
COMPARED TO HER.

13:10.370 --> 13:12.543
- WE HAD A HEART-TO-HEART,
I EXPRESSED TO HER

13:12.650 --> 13:14.959
THAT I FELT SHE DIDN'T NEED
TO TRADE ON HER LOOKS

13:15.070 --> 13:16.059
SO MUCH,
THAT SHE'S A SMART GIRL,

13:16.170 --> 13:18.024
SHE DOESN'T NEED
TO DRESS LIKE THAT ALL THE TIME.

13:18.140 --> 13:19.277
- ADAM.
- THAT'S ALL I SAID.

13:19.380 --> 13:20.756
- YOU TOLD HER
SHE WAS BEAUTIFUL ON THE INSIDE.

13:20.860 --> 13:22.134
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

13:22.240 --> 13:24.481
WHAT YOUNG GIRL'S
NOT GONNA RESPOND TO THAT?

13:24.590 --> 13:25.796
- SO IT'S MY FAULT?

13:25.900 --> 13:27.242
- I'M JUST SAYING
YOU STARTED IT,

13:27.350 --> 13:29.409
SO YOU CAN'T NOW FIRE HER
FOR SOMETHING--

13:29.530 --> 13:30.974
- I DON'T WANT TO FIRE HER.
I HAVE TO FIRE HER.

13:31.080 --> 13:32.388
I'M JUST TRYING
TO KEEP THE PEACE AT HOME.

13:32.500 --> 13:35.628
- LIKE I WANT TO,
LITTLE DARLIN'

13:35.740 --> 13:37.731
'CAUSE YOU KNOW

13:37.850 --> 13:40.080
- WELL, IT DOESN'T SEEM RIGHT
THAT TO CLEAN UP

13:40.190 --> 13:42.704
YOUR SIDE OF THE STREET YOU'VE
GOT TO DUMP ALL OVER HERS.

13:42.820 --> 13:44.151
I JUST DON'T FEEL
LIKE THAT'S RIGHT.

13:44.270 --> 13:45.669
- CAN YOU JUST HELP ME OUT?
CAN YOU GET BEHIND THIS?

13:45.790 --> 13:46.950
CAN YOU SUPPORT ME IN THIS?

13:47.060 --> 13:50.302
- I DO LO-OO-VE YOU

13:50.410 --> 13:52.822

THAT YOU WERE WRONG.

JUST FOR YOU
- I WANT YOU TO ACKNOWLEDGE

13:58.940 --> 14:00.862
THAT YOU DID SOMETHING WRONG
FOR ONCE.

14:00.970 --> 14:02.767
AND NOW THIS GIRL
HAS TO BE FIRED ABOUT IT.

14:02.870 --> 14:05.247
- MAYBE MY WIFE OVERREACT ED,
BUT I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING WRONG.

14:05.360 --> 14:06.873

[car horns continue blaring]

16:59.770 --> 17:03.319

IN ALL KINDS OF COMBINATIONS.

17:03.430 --> 17:06.046
JABBAR, YOU KNOW,
SOME KIDS HAVE PARENTS

17:06.160 --> 17:08.185
WHO ARE THE SAME COLOR
LIKE SYDNEY AND MAX.

17:08.300 --> 17:10.188
- AND SOME PARENTS
HAVE DIFFERENT COLORS,

17:10.300 --> 17:12.814
LIKE YOU GUYS.
- YEAH, YOU KNOW, MORE FLAVOR.

17:12.920 --> 17:14.717
- RIGHT.
[chuckles]

17:14.820 --> 17:15.889
AND YOU KNOW SOME KIDS

17:16.000 --> 17:18.059
WHO HAVE ONE MOMMY AND ONE DADDY

17:18.170 --> 17:21.094
AND SOME WHO HAVE TWO MOMMIES
OR TWO DADDIES.

17:21.210 --> 17:22.859
- LIKE JENSEN?

17:22.970 --> 17:24.301
- RIGHT.
JUST LIKE JENSEN.

- YEAH.

17:25.800 --> 17:26.892
- OH.
- YEAH.

17:27.010 --> 17:28.204
BUT WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT NOW

17:28.320 --> 17:30.788
IS THAT SOME FAMILIES
HAVE MOMS AND DADS

17:30.910 --> 17:34.528
THAT ARE MARRIED
AND LIVE UNDER THE SAME ROOF...

17:34.630 --> 17:37.110
- AND SOME KIDS HAVE PARENTS
WHO AREN'T MARRIED

17:37.220 --> 17:38.847
AND LIVE UNDER DIFFERENT ROOFS.

17:38.950 --> 17:42.158
BUT, YOU KNOW, THAT DOESN'T MEAN
THEY CAN'T BE AS HAPPY

17:42.260 --> 17:45.013
AS THE OTHER FAMILIES.

17:45.130 --> 17:49.362
WELL, YOU KNOW MOM AND I
HAVE DECIDED

17:49.480 --> 17:54.133
TO NOT LIVE TOGETHER
AND BE FRIENDS, RIGHT?

17:55.620 --> 17:57.656
- SO THAT ALSO MEANS

17:57.760 --> 18:00.649
THAT THERE WON'T BE
A WEDDING LIKE WE PLANNED.

18:00.760 --> 18:05.208
- BUT YOU SAID
YOU WERE GONNA GET MARRIED

18:05.320 --> 18:08.938
AND I WAS GONNA WEAR A SUIT
AND BE IN THE WEDDING

18:09.050 --> 18:11.564
AND I WOULD GET
TO HOLD THE RING.

18:12.950 --> 18:14.326
- YEAH, WELL, YOU'RE RIGHT.

18:14.430 --> 18:15.806
WE DID TELL YOU THAT.

18:15.920 --> 18:18.059
- AND WE'RE REALLY SORRY.

18:18.160 --> 18:19.366
WE'RE REALLY SORRY.

18:19.470 --> 18:20.710
WE SHOULDN'T HAVE TOLD YOU
THOSE THINGS

18:20.820 --> 18:24.028
UNTIL WE WERE 150% SURE.

18:24.130 --> 18:28.544
- SO YOU'RE NEVER, EVER
GONNA GET MARRIED?

18:34.450 --> 18:35.382
- NO.

18:35.490 --> 18:38.482
- NO.
- ARE YOU SURE?

18:38.600 --> 18:40.659
both: YEAH.

18:44.530 --> 18:49.490

THAT'S WHY.
- INTERESTING.

20:48.550 --> 20:50.757
- I AM GOING TO GO GET DESSERT.

22:10.840 --> 22:12.523
UM...

22:12.640 --> 22:14.392
THIS IS TERRIBLY EMBARRASSING.

22:14.500 --> 22:18.152
I FEEL ASHAMED
TO HAVE TO ASK,

22:18.260 --> 22:23.129
AND JUST KNOW
THAT I WOULD ONLY ASK

22:23.230 --> 22:25.437
IF I REALLY, REALLY NEEDED IT.

22:25.550 --> 22:31.204
UM, I'M HAVING A BIT
OF MONEY TROUBLE.

22:31.310 --> 22:33.961
I JUST CAN'T MAKE IT ALL
ADD UP.

22:34.070 --> 22:36.174
AND--
- HOW MUCH?

22:36.280 --> 22:41.832
- WELL, THE SORT OF EMERGENCY
NUMBER IS ABOUT 140.

22:41.940 --> 22:46.900
BUT I COULD--
- HOW MUCH DO YOU REALLY NEED?

22:47.020 --> 22:49.739
- IT'S A BIG NUMBER.

22:49.850 --> 22:53.126
IT'S ABOUT $400.

22:53.230 --> 22:54.572
I KNOW.
IT'S A LOT.

22:54.680 --> 22:56.432
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHERE IT'S GOING.

22:56.540 --> 23:00.192
YOU KNOW, GAS MONEY,
AND NOBODY TIPS ANYMORE.

23:00.300 --> 23:03.952
AND FOOD AND RENT,
AND I'M JUST TRYING TO MAKE IT.

23:04.070 --> 23:05.469
AND I'M DOING EVERYTHING
THAT I CAN,

23:05.590 --> 23:07.091
BUT IT'S NOT QUITE...

I PROMISE.

23:12.320 --> 23:14.652

23:17.320 --> 23:21.142

IN THIS SITUATION MYSELF

23:21.260 --> 23:23.979
MORE THAN A COUPLE OF TIMES,
SO...

23:24.090 --> 23:26.672
TELL YOU WHAT I'M GONNA DO.

23:26.780 --> 23:30.227
I'M GONNA LEND YOU
THE $400, OKAY,

23:30.330 --> 23:31.979
BUT IT'S A ONE-TIME THING.

23:32.100 --> 23:33.886
OF COURSE.
- I KNOW THAT YOU'RE WORKING

23:33.990 --> 23:36.879
VERY HARD,
BUT IT'S NOT CUTTING IT.

23:37.000 --> 23:38.752
SO OBVIOUSLY YOU'RE GOING
TO HAVE

23:38.860 --> 23:41.420
TO FIGURE
SOMETHING ELSE OUT.

23:41.520 --> 23:43.033
- YEAH.

23:43.140 --> 23:46.007

24:10.480 --> 24:11.811

24:11.930 --> 24:14.023
I INVITE YOU HERE
FOR SCREW SORTING,

24:14.140 --> 24:15.619
AND YOU SCREW IT ALL UP.
I MEAN, COME ON.

24:15.730 --> 24:16.754
- I'M TRYING TO DO IT RIGHT.

24:16.860 --> 24:18.179
- JUST LEAVE IT ALONE,
LEAVE IT ALONE.

24:18.280 --> 24:19.417
- I DIDN'T KNOW THEY WERE--

24:19.520 --> 24:20.964
- IT'S NOT ROCKET SCIENCE HERE,
CROSBY.

24:21.080 --> 24:23.526
WHAT'S WRONG?
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

24:23.630 --> 24:25.860
WHERE ARE YOU AT?
- I THINK--I WAS JUST THINKING

24:25.980 --> 24:28.073
ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE--
- WHAT ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT?

24:28.190 --> 24:30.567
- UM, SOMETHING AT HOME.

24:33.090 --> 24:34.637
- LIKE WHAT?

24:34.740 --> 24:37.129
- WELL, JABBAR ASKED JASMINE AND
I WHEN WE WERE GETTING MARRIED

24:37.230 --> 24:40.984
THE OTHER DAY,
AND HE WAS REALLY CONFUSED.

24:41.100 --> 24:43.477
SO WE SAT HIM DOWN
AND EXPLAINED TO HIM

24:43.580 --> 24:45.309
THAT WE WEREN'T GETTING MARRIED,

24:45.410 --> 24:49.028
AND HE WAS
JUST REALLY DISAPPOINTED

24:49.140 --> 24:51.540
AND...

24:51.660 --> 24:54.629
I DON'T KNOW.
I THINK I...

24:54.730 --> 24:56.459
IT WAS KIND OF THE FIRST TIME
IT HIT ME

24:56.560 --> 24:58.972
THAT, YOU KNOW,
WHEN I CHEATED ON JASMINE,

24:59.080 --> 25:01.355
IT WASN'T
THAT JUST I LOST HER,

25:01.460 --> 25:03.257
YOU KNOW,
I RUINED HIS CHANCE

25:03.360 --> 25:05.499
AT HAVING A REAL FAMILY.

25:05.600 --> 25:08.012
THE FACT THAT HE CAN'T HAVE THAT
BECAUSE OF ME,

25:08.120 --> 25:09.599
IT'S...

25:09.710 --> 25:11.018
I JUST FEEL
LIKE A CRUMMY DAD,

25:11.130 --> 25:13.439
AND THAT'S
WHAT I WAS THINKING ABOUT.

25:13.540 --> 25:15.360
- NO, YOU DON'T SAY THAT,
SON.

25:15.470 --> 25:16.368
DON'T SAY THAT.

25:16.480 --> 25:19.540

I MEAN, JABBAR, CROSBY,
HE LOOKS UP TO YOU.

25:30.800 --> 25:32.529
I MEAN, HE WORSHIPS
THE GROUND YOU WALK ON.

25:32.630 --> 25:34.245
I WATCH HIM.

25:34.360 --> 25:36.419
JIMINY CHRISTMAS,
YOU'RE HIS HERO.

25:36.530 --> 25:38.737
YOU KNOW?
HE LOVES YOU.

25:38.840 --> 25:40.592
YOU'RE THE MAN
IN HIS LIFE.

25:40.710 --> 25:42.666

TO JABBAR.

25:42.780 --> 25:45.010
AND HE LOVES YOU.

25:45.120 --> 25:48.908
SO DON'T SAY
YOU'RE A BAD FATHER.

AND THEY KNOW WHAT IS GOING ON
WITH THEIR LIVES

28:42.510 --> 28:43.818
AND THEY DO OTHER THINGS.

28:43.920 --> 28:47.060
I JUST COME HERE
AND WORK EVERY DAY

28:47.170 --> 28:48.990
AS HARD AS I CAN,
AND I'M LIKE--

28:49.100 --> 28:51.967
STILL DON'T HAVE ENOUGH MONEY
TO DO ANYTHING.

28:52.070 --> 28:54.447
AND, YOU KNOW, I DON'T HAVE,
LIKE, A GOAL

28:54.560 --> 28:57.415
OR A PLAN OR ANYTHING
THAT I'M, LIKE, WORKING TOWARDS.

28:57.520 --> 29:03.004
SO I DON'T KNOW
HOW THIS IS GONNA GET BETTER.

29:05.080 --> 29:08.208
- WELL, LET'S FIND YOU A GOAL.

29:09.570 --> 29:13.506
AND MAKE A PLAN.

29:13.610 --> 29:15.396
WE'LL THINK OF SOMETHING.

29:15.510 --> 29:17.364
- [sighs]
- LOOK AT YOU.

29:17.470 --> 29:18.983
YOU'RE DOING SO GOOD.

29:19.100 --> 29:21.056
LOOK AT THIS.
THE PIPING CUP?

29:21.170 --> 29:23.195
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
PEOPLE WOULD KILL FOR THIS JOB.

29:23.310 --> 29:24.129
- YEAH, THANK YOU.

29:24.240 --> 29:25.377
- YOU'RE LIKE THE QUEEN
OF COFFEE.

29:25.480 --> 29:26.720
- MM-HMM. RIGHT.

29:26.830 --> 29:30.345
APPRECIATE IT.
- WE'LL FIGURE SOMETHING OUT.

29:30.450 --> 29:32.315
- WE HAVE, LIKE, EVERY BRAZILIAN
KNOWN TO MAN IN THERE.

29:32.420 --> 29:34.934
AND THEY'RE, LIKE, RUNNING
THROUGH THE HALL--

29:35.040 --> 29:37.520
HEY, BABE, REMEMBER WHEN BRAZIL
SCORED THAT GOAL

29:37.630 --> 29:39.598
AND THERE WERE, LIKE,
ALL THE CRAZY BRAZILIANS

29:39.700 --> 29:41.907
RUNNING THROUGH THE HALLWAYS
AND TH EY'RE--LALALAAAAH!

29:42.020 --> 29:43.806
DO YOU REMEMBER THAT?
- HOW COULD YOU FORGET?

29:43.920 --> 29:45.182
THAT WAS A GOOD GAME.

29:45.300 --> 29:46.631
THAT WAS A GOOD GAME.
- THAT WAS A GOOD GAME.

29:46.750 --> 29:48.741
- YEAH, WE DVR'D IT.
- WE DID. WE DID.

29:48.850 --> 29:51.159
WE MAYBE SHOULD HAVE
WATCHED IT LIVE.

29:51.270 --> 29:52.476
- I THINK I WAS ON
AT, LIKE, 3:00 AM. HERE.

29:52.580 --> 29:56.755
- JULIA COACHES
HER DAUGHTER'S SOCCER TEAM.

29:56.860 --> 29:59.306
- NICE.
- I MEAN, THEY'RE SEVEN, SO...

29:59.410 --> 30:02.345
IT'S KIND OF--
IT'S CONTROLLED CHAOS.

30:02.450 --> 30:05.510
I TRY TO INSTILL IN THEM
THE LOVE OF THE GAME.

30:05.630 --> 30:07.313
- [laughs]

30:07.420 --> 30:11.595
- YOU KNOW,
TROY'S AN OAKLAND NATIVE.

30:11.700 --> 30:13.076
- OH, YEAH?
- MM-HMM.

30:13.190 --> 30:16.944
- NOT THIS PARTICULAR
NEIGHBORHOOD, BUT NOT FAR.

30:17.050 --> 30:19.848
- YEAH, WE'RE KIND OF UP
IN THE BOONIES HERE.

30:19.950 --> 30:22.293
- YEAH, I WOULDN'T CALL THIS
THE BOONIES.

30:22.400 --> 30:26.188
- IT'S A LITTLE
OFF THE BEATEN PATH, I GUESS.

30:27.130 --> 30:29.303
THIS STEAK IS REALLY GOOD.

30:29.410 --> 30:30.547
- IT'S REALLY GOOD.

30:30.650 --> 30:32.959
- THANKS.

30:33.070 --> 30:35.231
- ZOE IS PSYCHED
YOU GUYS WANT THE BABY.

30:35.350 --> 30:37.989
SHE SPEAKS VERY HIGHLY
OF THE BOTH OF YOU,

30:38.110 --> 30:41.079
AND I CAN SEE WHY SHE SIGNED
THOSE PAPERS SO QUICKLY.

30:41.180 --> 30:42.693
- OH, THANK YOU.
- THANKS, MAN.

30:42.800 --> 30:47.624
- I GUESS WE JUST FELT
MAYBE IT WAS A BIT TOO QUICK.

30:49.260 --> 30:50.249
- MM-HMM.

30:50.360 --> 30:51.839
- WE'D LIKE TO CHANGE
SOME OF THE TERMS.

30:51.950 --> 30:54.805
- NO. WE DON'T WANT
TO CHANGE ANY OF THE TERMS.

30:54.920 --> 30:56.251
WE JUST--
WELL, TROY LOOKED INTO IT,

30:56.370 --> 30:58.361
AND WE JUST HAVE
A FEW QUESTIONS.

30:58.470 --> 31:00.984
- YOU'VE BEEN COVERING
HER MEDICAL EXPENSES.

31:01.100 --> 31:03.409
AND THAT'S BEEN AMAZING,
IT'S BEEN REALLY HELPFUL.

31:03.510 --> 31:05.785
- YEAH.
- BUT ZOE'S GONNA BE CARRYING

31:05.890 --> 31:07.232
AROUND THIS BABY
FOR NINE MONTHS.

31:07.340 --> 31:09.205
- MM-HMM.
- I MEAN, THAT'S ALMOST A YEAR

31:09.310 --> 31:10.891
OUT OF HER--
OUT OF OUR LIVES.

31:11.000 --> 31:12.797
- OKAY.

31:12.900 --> 31:13.719
- SHE'S GONNA GO
THROUGH THE TRAUMA

31:13.830 --> 31:14.933
OF DELIVERING IT.

31:15.040 --> 31:16.655
- RIGHT.
I DON'T KNOW

31:16.770 --> 31:18.931
IF WE'VE REALLY
FULLY EXPRESSED

31:19.040 --> 31:21.110
HOW GRATEFUL WE ARE
FOR THIS.

31:21.220 --> 31:23.973
YOU KNOW,
IT'S THE MOST INCREDIBLE GIFT

31:24.080 --> 31:26.048
THAT ANYONE COULD EVER GIVE US,

31:26.160 --> 31:27.912
AND WE REALLY CONSIDER
THAT WE'RE SO LUCKY.

31:28.020 --> 31:29.908
AND WE'RE SO HAPPY.

31:30.020 --> 31:32.909
- WE'RE SO SUPER PSYCHED--
- WHAT I'M GETTING AT

31:33.020 --> 31:35.090
IS PEOPLE PAY A LOT OF MONEY
FOR A BABY TH ESE DAYS.

31:35.200 --> 31:40.479
A GIRL ZOE'S AGE CAN GET
UP TO 30K JUST FOR AN EGG.

31:42.100 --> 31:45.103
- UM, TROY, IF YOU'RE ASKING
FOR WHAT

31:45.210 --> 31:47.610
I THINK YOU'RE ASKING,

31:47.730 --> 31:50.312
I HAVE TO TELL YOU THAT,
IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA,

31:50.420 --> 31:53.719
IT'S ILLEGAL TO PAY
A BIOLOGICAL PARENT

31:53.840 --> 31:55.284
FOR THEIR CHILD.
- AREN'T YOU A LAWYER?

31:55.390 --> 31:56.800
- YES.
- RIGHT, SO THEY PAY YOU

31:56.910 --> 31:58.525
TO WORK AROUND THE LAWS, NO?
- I ALWAYS THOUGHT TROY SHOULD--

31:58.640 --> 32:00.119
- NO.
[clatter]

32:00.220 --> 32:02.802
- TROY, MY WIFE'S JOB
IS ACTUALLY TO UPHOLD THE LAW.

32:02.920 --> 32:03.807
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

32:03.920 --> 32:05.012
IT'S TO MAKE SURE

32:05.130 --> 32:06.745
THAT PEOPLE AREN'T TREATED
UNFAIRLY.

32:06.850 --> 32:08.078
SO, WHEN YOU COME
INTO OUR HOUSE

32:08.200 --> 32:09.599
AND YOU TRY
TO COERCE US--

32:09.720 --> 32:11.984
- WE'RE NOT TRYING TO COERCE--
LET ME JUST SAY,

32:12.100 --> 32:13.499
THIS IS SUCH A MISUNDERSTANDING.

32:13.620 --> 32:14.712
THAT'S NOT WHAT WE'RE DOING.
WE WOULD NEVER DO THAT.

32:14.820 --> 32:19.029
- IT JUST--IT FEELS TO ME
LIKE IT'S A LITTLE ONE-SIDED.

32:19.140 --> 32:20.755
YOU GUYS HAVE LAID OUT
YOUR TERMS,

32:20.860 --> 32:21.929
YOU'RE GETTING
EVERYTHING YOU WANT,

32:22.040 --> 32:24.179
YOU'RE DOING PRETTY WELL
FOR YOURSELVES.

32:24.280 --> 32:27.829
I THINK IT'S ONLY FAIR
ZOE AND I GET TO SAY

32:27.940 --> 32:30.625
WHAT WE FEEL WORKS FOR US.

32:39.370 --> 32:42.954
OKAY, FINE.

32:43.060 --> 32:45.711
- OH, TROY, COME ON.
SIT DOWN.

32:45.820 --> 32:47.333
THEY MADE DINNER.

32:47.440 --> 32:49.192
- CAN WE--CAN WE SIT AND TALK
ABOUT THIS?

32:49.310 --> 32:51.301
- THANK YOU FOR THE STEAK.
IT WAS GREAT.

32:51.410 --> 32:52.968
- TROY, JUST SIT DOWN.
COME ON.

32:53.070 --> 32:56.107
- WE SHOULD TALK ABOUT IT.
- WE'RE GOING.

32:56.210 --> 32:59.964
THANK YOU FOR HAVING US,
AND YOU KNOW WHERE TO FIND US.

33:03.800 --> 33:05.768
- I'M SORRY.

33:19.890 --> 33:21.994
[door opens]

33:24.140 --> 33:26.779
- HEY.
[door shuts]

33:28.590 --> 33:29.614
ALL THE KIDS ASLEEP?

33:29.730 --> 33:31.345
- YUP.
- ALL RIGHT.

33:31.450 --> 33:33.099
- HOW WAS YOUR DAY?
- IT WAS OKAY.

33:33.210 --> 33:34.108
HOW ARE YOU DOING?
- I'M GOOD.

33:34.210 --> 33:37.907
- MWAH.
- JUST A LITTLE TIRED.

33:38.010 --> 33:39.591
YOU HAVE A GOOD DAY?
- YOU ALL RIGHT?

33:39.700 --> 33:41.907
- MM-HMM.

33:42.020 --> 33:43.248
- HEY, I WANT TO TALK--

33:43.360 --> 33:45.112
- I ACTUALLY CALLED
THE STUDIO TODAY.

33:45.230 --> 33:46.424
YOU WEREN'T THERE,

33:46.540 --> 33:48.986
SO RACHEL ANSWERED.
- RIGHT.

33:49.090 --> 33:50.466
- I'M REALLY HOPING, ADAM,

33:50.580 --> 33:53.333
THAT YOU HAVE
A GREAT EXPLANATION--

33:53.440 --> 33:54.509
- IT'S A COMPLICATED SITUATION.
- 'CAUSE I'M TRYING

33:54.610 --> 33:55.986
SO DESPERATELY TO GIVE YOU
THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT

33:56.100 --> 33:56.953
ON THIS,
I REALLY AM.

33:57.060 --> 33:58.448
I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT IT
ALL DAY.

33:58.550 --> 33:59.926
- CAN YOU JUST LET ME EXPLAIN?
- TRY TO EXPLAIN.

34:00.030 --> 34:01.372
I JUST--I WOULD REALLY
LOVE TO HEAR

34:01.480 --> 34:02.447
WHAT YOU HAVE TO SAY
RIGHT NOW.

34:02.550 --> 34:04.859
- I TALKED TO CROSBY
ABOUT IT.

34:04.970 --> 34:06.756
- UH-HUH.
- AND AFTER THINKING ABOUT...

34:06.870 --> 34:10.624
- CROSBY? WHY DOES CROSBY HAVE
TO KNOW ANY OF THIS?

34:10.730 --> 34:11.970
- CAN YOU JUST STAY HERE--

34:12.080 --> 34:13.047
- JUST DON'T TOUCH ME
FOR A SECOND, PLEASE.

34:13.150 --> 34:14.424
JUST DON'T.
- ALL RIGHT.

34:14.530 --> 34:15.906
- I WANT TO HEAR
WHAT YOU HAVE TO SAY.

34:16.010 --> 34:17.329
BUT I'M SO SICK
TO MY STOMACH

34:17.430 --> 34:19.011
RIGHT NOW BECAUSE YOU LIED.

34:19.120 --> 34:20.348
YOU LIED TO ME.

34:20.470 --> 34:23.223
- I WENT OUT OF MY WAY
TO TELL YOU ABOUT THIS.

34:23.330 --> 34:25.150
- ADAM, WHY DID YOU TELL ME
ABOUT IT?

34:25.270 --> 34:27.079
WAIT A SECOND, WHY DID YOU
TELL ME ABOUT IT?

34:27.200 --> 34:29.543
- LISTEN TO ME,
I WENT TO THE STUDIO

34:29.650 --> 34:30.571
BECAUSE CROSBY SAID

34:30.680 --> 34:32.307
THAT SOMETHING WAS URGENT,
I GOT THERE.

34:32.410 --> 34:33.889
HE JUST WANTED
TO CELEBRATE FINISHING

34:34.000 --> 34:36.139
ARTY PARTYAND BOOKING
THE STUDIO FOR A MONTH.

34:36.240 --> 34:37.093
THAT'S ALL IT WAS.
- OH, GOOD.

34:37.210 --> 34:38.279
YOU GUYS WERE CELEBRATING.

34:38.380 --> 34:39.859
- HE BROKE OUT SOME TEQUILA...

34:39.970 --> 34:40.891
- YOU WERE DRINKING TOGETHER?

34:41.000 --> 34:42.388
- I HAD ONE DRINK.

34:42.490 --> 34:43.798
CROSBY AND RACHEL
HAD TOO MUCH TO DRINK.

34:43.900 --> 34:46.175
I WASN'T DRUNK.
I DIDN'T KISS HER.

34:46.290 --> 34:48.315
SHE KISSED ME.
- DID YOU STOP THE KISS?

34:48.430 --> 34:49.590
- YES.

34:49.700 --> 34:50.496
- HOW?

34:50.600 --> 34:52.352
HOW DID YOU DO THAT?
WHAT DID YOU DO?

34:52.460 --> 34:54.155
YOU DROVE HER HOME...
GO AHEAD, I WANT TO HEAR THIS.

34:54.260 --> 34:56.319
- IT WAS RAINING.
- OKAY.

34:56.430 --> 34:57.943
- [sighs]

34:58.060 --> 34:59.129
YOU KNOW, KRISTINA,

34:59.230 --> 35:00.982
THIS IS A DIFFICULT THING
FOR ME TO EXPLAIN, OKAY?

35:01.090 --> 35:02.227
- REALLY?
- YEAH, IT IS.

35:02.340 --> 35:03.477
IT'S VERY DIFFICULT.
IT WAS RAINING...

35:03.580 --> 35:05.093
- IT'S A REALLY DIFFICULT THING
FOR ME--

35:05.200 --> 35:07.646
- I HAD HAD A CONVERSATION WITH
HER ABOUT THE WAY SHE DRESSED,

35:07.760 --> 35:09.512
THAT SHE DIDN'T HAVE
TO DRESS SO PROVOCATIVELY.

35:09.620 --> 35:10.848
- DO YOU LIKE
THE WAY THAT SHE DRESSES, ADAM?

35:10.970 --> 35:12.062
IS THAT WHAT THIS IS ABOUT?

35:12.170 --> 35:13.273
- PLEASE DON'T PUT WORDS
IN MY MOUTH.

35:13.380 --> 35:14.301
- NO, I'M NOT.
WHY ARE YOU KEEPING HER THERE?

35:14.420 --> 35:15.967
IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE
TO ME.

35:16.070 --> 35:17.867
I'M JUST--
I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT.

35:17.970 --> 35:19.835
- I TRIED TO FIRE HER, OKAY?

35:19.940 --> 35:21.976
I COULDN'T...

35:22.080 --> 35:23.695
JUST LET ME FINISH,
ALL RIGHT?

35:23.810 --> 35:25.004
- I'M LISTENING.

35:25.120 --> 35:26.451
- THEY WERE DRINKING, OKAY?

35:26.570 --> 35:28.356
I DIDN'T WANT ANOTHER
GABY SITUATION ON MY HANDS.

35:28.470 --> 35:29.459
IT WAS RAINING OUTSIDE.

35:29.570 --> 35:31.117
I WANTED TO TAKE--
I THOUGHT THE RIGHT THING

35:31.230 --> 35:33.198
TO DO WAS TO TAKE
THE YOUNG GIRL HOME.

35:33.300 --> 35:35.086
SHE WAS DRUNK.
- DID YOU GET OUT OF THE CAR?

35:35.200 --> 35:36.770
- YES, I DID.
I GOT OUT OF THE CAR,

35:36.890 --> 35:37.845
I WALKED HER
TO HER DOOR--

35:37.960 --> 35:39.234
- YOU WALKED HER
TO HER DOOR?

35:39.340 --> 35:40.989
SHE'S 26 YEARS OLD.
- IT WAS RAINING.

35:41.100 --> 35:42.260
- IT DOESN'T MATTER
IF IT'S RAINING.

35:42.380 --> 35:43.711
WHAT, IS SHE GONNA SLIP--

35:43.830 --> 35:45.024
- SHE LIVES
IN A DODGY NEIGHBORHOOD.

35:45.140 --> 35:45.959
I WAS TRYING
TO DO THE RIGHT THING.

35:46.070 --> 35:47.059
- THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

35:47.170 --> 35:48.171
- KRISTINA,
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

35:48.280 --> 35:49.486
- YOU KISSED
ANOTHER WOMAN.

35:49.590 --> 35:51.239
- I DIDN'T KISS ANOTHER WOMAN.

35:51.350 --> 35:52.692
SHE KISSED ME, KRISTINA.
LISTEN TO ME.

35:52.800 --> 35:54.620
OKAY?

35:54.730 --> 35:56.049
SHE KISSED ME, OKAY?

35:56.150 --> 35:57.594
I STOPPED THE KISS.

35:57.700 --> 35:59.179
I CAME HOME.

35:59.290 --> 36:01.872
KRISTINA--
- ARE YOU ATTRACT ED TO HER?

36:01.980 --> 36:05.108
- NO, I AM NOT ATTRACTED
TO HER.

36:05.230 --> 36:06.777
- ADAM, TELL ME THE TRUTH.

36:06.880 --> 36:09.326
ARE YOU ATTRACTED TO HER?

36:11.230 --> 36:12.982
- WHAT DO YOU WANT ME
TO SAY, KRISTINA?

36:13.100 --> 36:16.263
SHE'S AN ATTRACTIVE GIRL.
YES, I FIND HER ATTRACTIVE.

36:16.380 --> 36:18.132
I DON'T WANT
A RELATIONSHIP WITH HER.

36:19.450 --> 36:23.034
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

36:23.140 --> 36:25.654
- ARE YOU ATTRACT ED TO ME?

36:30.010 --> 36:32.240
- YES, KRISTINA,
OF COURSE I'M ATTRACTED TO YOU.

36:32.360 --> 36:34.692
- NO, JUST DON'T TOUCH ME.
PLEASE DON'T TOUCH ME.

36:34.810 --> 36:37.256
I CAN'T. THIS IS HOW WE BECOME
ONE OF THE 80%.

36:37.360 --> 36:39.248
- NO, HOW WE BECOME
ONE OF THE 80% IS BY NOT--

36:39.360 --> 36:41.942
- I DON'T YOU
TO TOUCH ME RIGHT NOW!

36:43.990 --> 36:45.218
OKAY?

36:45.340 --> 36:46.784
- YOU'RE MAKING THIS
REALLY DIFFICULT.

36:46.890 --> 36:47.811
- I'M NOT, ADAM.

36:47.920 --> 36:48.955
ANY OTHER WOMAN WOULD SAY

36:49.060 --> 36:50.994
THE SAME THING RIGHT NOW.

36:51.100 --> 36:52.169
- KRISTINA,
SHE KISSED ME.

36:52.270 --> 36:53.589
I TOLD YOU ABOUT IT.

36:53.690 --> 36:55.066
YOU ASKED ME TO FIRE HER,
I TRIED TO FIRE HER,

36:55.170 --> 36:56.068
I COULDN'T GO THROUGH WITH IT,

36:56.170 --> 36:57.102
I FELT LIKE HER FEELINGS
WERE HURT--

36:57.210 --> 36:58.689
- "HER FEELINGS WERE HURT"?

36:58.800 --> 37:00.131
OH, GOD, I'M SO HAPPY

37:00.250 --> 37:05.040
THAT YOU CARE SO MUCH
ABOUT HER FEELINGS.

37:05.150 --> 37:06.424
- KRISTINA, CAN YOU STAY
IN THE ROOM?

37:06.530 --> 37:08.669
- I'VE DONE EVERYTHING FOR YOU
EVERY SINGLE TIME

37:08.770 --> 37:11.182
YOU NEED SUPPORT,
EMOTIONALLY, ANYTHING.

37:11.290 --> 37:12.939
I'M HOME EVERY SINGLE DAY

37:13.050 --> 37:14.085
MAKING THE KIDS' CALENDARS...

37:14.190 --> 37:15.259
- I KNOW.
- DOING THE CLEANING,

37:15.370 --> 37:17.258
THE COOKING, EVERYTHING.

37:17.370 --> 37:19.156
I'M MRS. BRAVERMAN.

37:19.270 --> 37:22.091
I HAVE MY HUSBAND'S BACK ALWAYS.

37:22.200 --> 37:23.360
NOT ANYMORE.

37:23.480 --> 37:27.405
- KRISTINA.
- I'M DONE.

37:39.420 --> 37:41.001
[knocking]

37:41.120 --> 37:43.452
- HEY.
- HI.

37:43.570 --> 37:45.970
- UM, JUST SAYING
GOOD NIGHT.

37:46.090 --> 37:48.115
I'M LEAVING, SO...
- OH.

37:48.230 --> 37:51.609
WELL, GOOD NIGHT.

37:51.710 --> 37:54.292
- OKAY, SO YOU HATE ME NOW,
RIGHT?

37:54.410 --> 37:55.889
YOU HATE ME.

37:55.990 --> 37:57.503
- NO.
I DON'T HATE YOU.

37:59.000 --> 38:00.570
- DO YOU HATE TROY?

38:02.620 --> 38:05.509
- NO, I JUST DIDN'T GET THE
CHANCE TO KNOW HIM VERY WELL.

38:05.620 --> 38:08.134
- YEAH.

38:08.250 --> 38:10.343
YOU KNOW,
HE'S SUCH A GOOD GUY.

38:10.460 --> 38:14.487
HE'S A REALLY GOOD GUY.

38:14.600 --> 38:16.591
AND HE'S JUST LOOKING OUT
FOR ME.

38:20.880 --> 38:24.566
LOOK, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO DO.

38:26.950 --> 38:30.477
- WELL, I CAN'T GIVE YOU MONEY
FOR THE BABY, ZOE.

38:36.860 --> 38:38.748
GOOD NIGHT.

38:41.350 --> 38:43.443
- YEAH, GOOD NIGHT.

38:54.500 --> 38:57.492
- HE LEFT CINNAMON
AT MY HOUSE.

38:57.610 --> 38:59.987
I KNOW SOMETIMES HE HAS A HARD
TIME SLEEPING WITHOUT HIM, SO...

39:00.090 --> 39:02.229
- THANK YOU.
YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO DO THAT.

39:02.340 --> 39:03.648
- CAN I GIVE IT TO HIM?

39:03.750 --> 39:06.162
- OH, HE'S AT MY MOM'S HOUSE
TONIGHT

39:06.270 --> 39:08.431
'CAUSE I HAD A LATE CLASS, SO...
- OH.

39:08.550 --> 39:10.233
WELL, THE TRUTH IS,
I THINK HE SLEEPS FINE

39:10.340 --> 39:11.580
WITHOUT CINNAMON.
I JUST WANTED TO SEE HIM.

39:11.690 --> 39:13.658
SO YOU CAN GIVE IT TO HIM.

39:13.760 --> 39:14.681
- [chuckles]

39:14.800 --> 39:17.758
OH.

39:17.870 --> 39:20.179
DID WE MESS UP?

39:20.280 --> 39:22.316
I'M WORRIED THAT WE,
LIKE, RUINED HIM.

39:22.420 --> 39:24.047
- YEAH, I THINK
WE MESSED UP.

39:24.150 --> 39:25.242
BUT I THINK WE'RE GONNA MESS UP,

39:25.360 --> 39:27.009
LIKE A THOUSAND MORE TIMES
BEFORE HE'S 18.

39:27.120 --> 39:28.701
I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD GET

39:28.810 --> 39:30.152
TOO SPUN OUT ABOUT THIS ONE.

39:30.260 --> 39:32.399
- OKAY.
- AND MY DAD

39:32.500 --> 39:34.127
HAPPENED TO TELL ME
THAT HE THINKS

39:34.230 --> 39:35.322
WE'RE INCREDIBLE PARENTS.

39:35.440 --> 39:36.668
- WHAT?
- YEAH.

39:36.780 --> 39:38.338
AND YOU KNOW WHAT
A TOUGH JUDGE HE IS.

39:38.440 --> 39:39.361
YEAH.
- OKAY.

39:39.480 --> 39:41.675
- YEAH.
- I FEEL A LITTLE BETTER NOW.

39:41.790 --> 39:45.715
YOU KNOW, I OPENED UP
THAT BOTTLE OF CAB

39:45.830 --> 39:46.512
THAT YOU LIKE.

39:46.620 --> 39:48.827
YOU WANT TO JOIN ME
FOR A DRINK?

39:48.930 --> 39:51.034
- YEAH, I WANT TO JOIN YOU
FOR A DRINK.

39:51.140 --> 39:52.653
- OH.

39:52.760 --> 39:54.000
- NO, IT'S ACTUALLY $5 A GLASS.

39:54.110 --> 39:55.452
- TOTALLY WORTH IT. I'LL PAY.
- I'LL WAIVE IT.

39:55.560 --> 39:58.245
- I'LL PAY $10.
- YOU SEEM SO EXCITED.

39:58.360 --> 39:59.588
YOU'RE SO EXCITED.

39:59.700 --> 40:02.942
HEY.

40:03.050 --> 40:04.187
- HEY, CAN WE TALK?

40:04.290 --> 40:05.848
- I'VE DECIDED TO GO BACK
TO WORK.

40:08.990 --> 40:10.196
- KRISTINA--
- I'VE BEEN THINKING

40:10.300 --> 40:11.676
ABOUT OUR CONVERSATION
THE OTHER DAY,

40:11.780 --> 40:14.192
AND I'M ALWAYS WILLING
TO DO WHAT'S BEST FOR YOU

40:14.300 --> 40:15.927
AND WHAT'S BEST
FOR THE FAMILY,

40:16.030 --> 40:19.022
AND I'VE DECIDED
TO DO WHAT'S BEST FOR ME.

40:21.210 --> 40:24.509
AND I DON'T WANT TO HAVE
A CONVERSATION ABOUT IT.

40:25.900 --> 40:28.482
NOT RIGHT NOW.

40:29.840 --> 40:31.979
WHO'S THE BIGGEST GIRL?

40:32.080 --> 40:35.140
WHO'S MOMMY'S BIG GIRL?

40:45.680 --> 40:47.671
- MM, THAT'S LOVELY.

40:47.790 --> 40:49.223
- MAKES ME WANT TO HEAR
A LITTLE KENNETH G.

40:49.340 --> 40:51.228
A LITTLE KEN G.

40:51.340 --> 40:53.194
- A LITTLE KEN G.
- [laughs]

40:53.310 --> 40:54.641
- I PROPOSE A TOAST

40:54.760 --> 40:57.137
TO SUBPAR PARENTING SKILLS.

40:57.240 --> 40:59.800
- OKAY.

41:03.560 --> 41:06.176
- TO DR. JOE.

41:06.290 --> 41:07.177
[laughter]

41:07.290 --> 41:08.803

41:11.260 --> 41:12.420
- [laughs]

41:12.530 --> 41:14.532
- LISTEN
TO ADULT CONTEMPORARY MUSIC.

41:14.640 --> 41:16.369
- HE DOESN'T DO THAT.

41:16.470 --> 41:17.607
- DOES HE LISTEN
TO ADULT CONTEMPORARY?

41:17.710 --> 41:19.359
