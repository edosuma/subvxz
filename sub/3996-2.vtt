SCHMIDT:
Jess.

00:03.164 --> 00:04.364
Yeah.

00:04.432 --> 00:05.499
Can I ask you something?

00:05.566 --> 00:06.733
You want my help?

00:06.801 --> 00:08.835
Sure.

00:08.903 --> 00:10.704
You consider me
a sexy man, correct?

00:10.772 --> 00:13.173
- I don't know how to answer
that question.  - Okay, look,

00:13.241 --> 00:14.808
I'm meeting a girl
for drinks tonight,

00:14.876 --> 00:16.576
and I'm probably going
to bring her back here for sex.

00:16.644 --> 00:18.378
I have to get to school
'cause it's Astronomy Day

00:18.446 --> 00:19.946
and I'm dressing up like Galileo

00:20.014 --> 00:22.049
- so I have to put on my beard.
- I get that,

00:22.116 --> 00:24.851
but as a lady, where in the room
do I look sexiest?

00:24.919 --> 00:28.688
You know, like, like where am I
best on display-- here?

00:31.359 --> 00:36.363
Here or... here?

00:36.431 --> 00:37.664
Hey, what is
going on...?

00:37.732 --> 00:39.199
Um, Schmidt wants
to know

00:39.267 --> 00:41.635
where in his room
he looks the sexiest.

00:41.702 --> 00:42.903
Well, it's
a big room.

00:42.970 --> 00:44.037
What are
your choices?

00:44.105 --> 00:45.205
Okay, I'm glad you asked.

00:45.273 --> 00:47.941
All right, here.

00:48.009 --> 00:48.708
Okay.

00:51.646 --> 00:53.280
Here...

00:53.347 --> 00:55.982
or here, you know,
maybe just reading a book or...

00:56.050 --> 00:57.051
That's a lot of options.

00:57.118 --> 00:58.785
- Could you do 'em again really fast?
- You want to see 'em again?

00:58.853 --> 01:00.654
- Please.
- Okay, here,

01:01.221 --> 01:02.989
here,

01:03.857 --> 01:04.825
here.

01:04.891 --> 01:07.427
- Wait, what was the first one again?
- Yeah.

01:07.495 --> 01:10.030
Okay, I get it,
all laugh at Schmidt, great.

I'm so excited to meet him.

01:37.525 --> 01:39.192
No, Jess, he's sleeping.

01:39.260 --> 01:40.460
He flew in late
last night.

01:40.528 --> 01:41.795
We took him straight
to the bar.

01:41.863 --> 01:43.296
Took a bunch of
shots, got drunk,

01:43.364 --> 01:44.931
screamed
"I love America,"

01:44.999 --> 01:46.766

- You're still the new kid.

01:52.039 --> 01:54.241
- Winston lived here before Coach did.
- So Coach said

01:54.308 --> 01:55.509
that they used
to play basketball

01:55.576 --> 01:56.877
together
in college,

01:56.944 --> 01:58.912
but then Winston
went pro?

01:58.980 --> 02:01.314
In Latvia, okay,
he went, went pro in Latvia.

02:01.382 --> 02:03.683
It's a big difference.
Well, the team logo

02:03.751 --> 02:06.319
is a fig, just a,
just one single fig.

02:06.387 --> 02:08.455
Oh, you're jealous--
that's so cute.

02:08.523 --> 02:10.923
Of Winston? No, no, no, I'm not,
I'm not jealous of Winston.

02:10.991 --> 02:11.791
Okay, it's been two years.

02:11.859 --> 02:13.660
He's gonna have
to recognize.

02:13.728 --> 02:15.428

- Ba-boom.

He's going to love it.

It's just that I'm
really low on clothes

with my boyfriend.

SCHMIDT: Jess, you know what?

It's where I keep

03:21.729 --> 03:23.897
What have you done to me, Nick?

03:23.965 --> 03:26.166
I am so happy
you're back.

Wow.

Oh, look at that.

'06.

03:37.712 --> 03:40.180
Yeah, nothing orthodox
about what we did that night.

03:40.248 --> 03:41.848
Winston seems nice.

03:41.916 --> 03:43.383
Did he say anything
to you about the room?

03:43.451 --> 03:45.018
- What room?
- The big room.

03:45.086 --> 03:46.553
I kind of took it
from him when he left.

03:46.621 --> 03:48.021
I used to be
in the small room.

03:49.824 --> 03:51.157
This happened
in the small room.

03:52.159 --> 03:53.927
Twice.

03:53.995 --> 03:56.363
Never going back there
again, Jess.

03:56.430 --> 03:58.565
He's never going to give
you that room back.

03:58.633 --> 03:59.933
(scoffs)
Come on, man, it's Schmidt.

04:00.001 --> 04:01.635
You know, they have
a saying in Latvia:

04:01.702 --> 04:04.738
That guy is so stupid,

04:04.805 --> 04:07.173
we could easily take things
away from him.

04:07.241 --> 04:08.975
(laughing): That's a saying?
- Yeah, it is.

04:09.043 --> 04:10.510
(indistinct chatter)

04:10.578 --> 04:13.413
(grunting)

04:13.481 --> 04:14.848

NICK: Jess,

04:14.915 --> 04:16.048
I've been telling you this
for weeks,

04:16.117 --> 04:18.985
but you got to call Spencer and
you got to get your stuff back

04:19.053 --> 04:20.353
unless,
you know,

04:20.421 --> 04:22.155
unless you're scared.

04:22.223 --> 04:23.757
No, I am not scared.

04:23.824 --> 04:25.558
It's just complicated.

04:26.961 --> 04:29.829
That stuff was,
that stuff was ours

04:29.897 --> 04:30.864
and the
house was...

04:30.931 --> 04:34.134
Jess, look, it's a ball.

04:34.201 --> 04:38.038
Oh, a little b-ball, huh?

04:38.105 --> 04:39.339

I'm sorry, you guys.

05:05.504 --> 05:07.438
That was my TV, Jess.

05:07.506 --> 05:08.539
It's kind of
all he had.

05:08.607 --> 05:09.874
I'll get you
a new one.

05:09.941 --> 05:11.175
I just can't afford it
right now.

05:11.243 --> 05:13.310
If you don't mind me asking,
what's the plan?

05:13.378 --> 05:14.311
WINSTON: You don't
know me like that,

05:14.379 --> 05:15.479
but I need a TV.

05:15.547 --> 05:16.680
Do you have a TV
at Spencer's?

05:16.748 --> 05:18.382
Yeah, I do, it's just really big

05:18.450 --> 05:19.717
and thin and bright.

05:19.784 --> 05:21.051
- Go get it.
- Go get it.

05:21.119 --> 05:23.420
No, I can't call
Spencer, I haven't talked to him

05:23.488 --> 05:25.389
since he cheated
on me with that ho.

05:25.457 --> 05:29.393
Actually, that's not fair--
she might be a really nice ho.

05:29.461 --> 05:30.728
I just don't want to
get in a big fight

05:30.795 --> 05:32.897
with Spencer. I want to be
friends with him eventually.

05:32.964 --> 05:34.865
Why do you want
to be friends with your ex?

05:34.933 --> 05:36.834
I don't want to be
friends with Caroline,

05:36.902 --> 05:38.869
and all she did was rip me
open and tear out my heart

05:38.937 --> 05:41.338
with her perfect,
perfect hands.

05:41.406 --> 05:42.640

05:42.707 --> 05:43.841

05:43.909 --> 05:44.909
It's like he's

05:44.976 --> 05:46.677
a wizard and I'm his mage.

05:46.745 --> 05:47.745
I think it's
his hair.

05:47.812 --> 05:48.946
He has this, like,

05:49.014 --> 05:50.414
really beautiful hair,
and whenever I see it,

05:50.482 --> 05:51.615
I get the whoo-whoos.

05:51.683 --> 05:53.150
Oh, my God,

05:53.218 --> 05:55.219
- I hate my life.
- All right, guys-- Jess,

05:55.287 --> 05:59.456
look, Jess,
I know.

05:59.724 --> 06:00.658
Closure.

06:01.893 --> 06:03.394
Ouch.

06:03.961 --> 06:05.095

06:05.163 --> 06:06.797

you're saying right now.

Okay, Jess,
think about it.

06:08.533 --> 06:09.400

that complicated.

06:09.467 --> 06:10.768
Jess, just get the TV back.

06:10.835 --> 06:12.236

- Absolutely.

07:16.534 --> 07:17.901

you guys think that

07:17.969 --> 07:20.304
because, you know,

07:20.372 --> 07:22.172
- I think that, too.
- 100%.

07:22.240 --> 07:23.641
I mean, when I moved
out, obviously

07:23.708 --> 07:25.376
there was a power vacuum.

07:25.443 --> 07:27.444
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah, I needed a leader.

07:27.512 --> 07:29.146
I didn't know
which end was up.

07:29.214 --> 07:31.482
No, Nick's a bottom--
you know what I mean.

07:31.549 --> 07:32.750
Absolutely.

07:32.817 --> 07:34.251
Say, Winston,
do all

07:34.319 --> 07:36.387
top dogs need
the biggest room

07:36.454 --> 07:37.521
or, I don't
know, is that

07:37.589 --> 07:38.789
kind of cheesy,
is it a little overkill?

07:38.857 --> 07:40.057
No, no, no, no,
but I definitely see

07:40.125 --> 07:41.692
what you're saying,
though, definitely.

07:41.760 --> 07:43.594
Um, every top dog
is different,

07:43.662 --> 07:45.062
every top dog
is different.

07:45.130 --> 07:48.232
Hey, Schmidt, what, uh,
kind of top dog are you?

07:49.299 --> 07:50.434
The kind with the big room.

07:52.637 --> 07:54.371
I'm so glad
we're talking.

07:54.439 --> 07:56.607
Last time I saw you,
you were so mad.

07:56.675 --> 07:58.275

08:13.158 --> 08:15.159
Not enough.

Um, Spencer, I need
my stuff back--

08:18.396 --> 08:19.763
my TV and all my
winter clothes...

08:19.831 --> 08:21.365
- Yeah, of course.
- ...and my plants.

08:21.433 --> 08:23.333
I would have brought it today,
but I rode my bike here,

08:23.401 --> 08:25.736
- you know, without the basket.
- Okay,

08:25.804 --> 08:27.703
well, when would be a good
time for me to come...

08:27.704 --> 08:28.639
It's so good to see you.

08:28.707 --> 08:30.674
- Spencer, I really need my stu...
- Shh.

08:32.243 --> 08:34.912
I need something, too.

08:34.979 --> 08:36.346
♪ She's dressed in yellow,
she says hello... ♪

08:36.414 --> 08:38.381
Thanks for taking me
to the airport, Jess.

08:38.450 --> 08:39.817
Of course.

08:39.884 --> 08:43.486
All you have is your bike,
Rochelle.

08:43.554 --> 08:44.588
SPENCER AND ROCHELLE:
♪ You want it ♪

08:44.656 --> 08:47.591
♪ You got it ♪

08:47.659 --> 08:49.860

08:49.928 --> 08:51.495

JESS:
<i>$550 for the TV?</i>

08:57.709 --> 08:59.410
Seems a little steep.

08:59.677 --> 09:01.145
I'm gonna write down
a figure

09:01.213 --> 09:03.514
and this is
as high as I'll go.

09:07.318 --> 09:09.553
You drew a smiley face.

09:09.621 --> 09:10.888
I'm a teacher.

09:10.955 --> 09:12.089
Do it for the kids.

09:12.157 --> 09:15.993
For the kids, $550.

09:16.061 --> 09:17.728
I can't go home
without a TV.

09:17.796 --> 09:19.329
I thought pawnshops

09:19.397 --> 09:20.931
were about helping people,
and frankly,

09:20.999 --> 09:22.833
right now I feel
taken advantage of,

09:22.901 --> 09:25.502
and I just got out
of a long relationship

09:25.570 --> 09:27.438
and I don't know
what I'm doing emotionally

09:27.505 --> 09:29.673
or-- let's be honest--
sexually.

09:31.877 --> 09:35.512
I'll just...
just get out of here.

09:41.386 --> 09:43.287
Are you trying to rob me?

09:49.694 --> 09:51.162
Hey, where's Winston at, man?

09:51.229 --> 09:52.964
I think he's in his room,
Schmidt.

09:55.400 --> 09:56.567
You really think
I'm top dog?

09:58.970 --> 09:59.937
Yes.

10:00.005 --> 10:01.372
You think I'm head baller,
shot caller?

10:03.975 --> 10:05.343
Yes, Schmidt, I feel that way.

10:07.678 --> 10:08.846
See that, man?

10:08.914 --> 10:10.648
That's my new thumb ring.
How choice is that?

10:11.716 --> 10:14.018
Little skull--
it's so nectar.

10:14.086 --> 10:15.386
Did you just
make up "nectar"?

10:15.454 --> 10:17.154
No, it's a volleyball term.

10:17.222 --> 10:18.689
What is Winston doing
in there?

10:18.757 --> 10:19.890
He can't hang out in there--
it's too small.

10:20.357 --> 10:22.190
- What's up?
- Yeah, what up ****.

10:22.294 --> 10:23.294
Hey, are you all right?

10:23.362 --> 10:25.663
I'm sorry,
I didn't get the TV.

10:25.731 --> 10:27.865
- What happened?
- Ugh, I'm a terrible roommate.

10:27.932 --> 10:28.766
I mean, seriously,

10:28.834 --> 10:30.234
you guys told her
to call Spencer?

10:30.302 --> 10:31.602
That is not
your job.

10:31.670 --> 10:33.004
That is my job.

10:33.071 --> 10:34.038
All right,
so what happened?

10:34.106 --> 10:35.573
(groans)

10:35.641 --> 10:37.875
He needed a ride to the airport.

10:37.943 --> 10:38.809
What?

10:38.877 --> 10:40.978
For his new girlfriend.

10:41.046 --> 10:42.279
NICK: Are you kidding me?
- Are you serious?

10:42.847 --> 10:44.949
I'm supposed to pick her up
next Sunday.

10:45.017 --> 10:47.018
- Oh, my God, Jess.
- Wow!

10:47.085 --> 10:48.419
What's wrong with me?!

10:48.487 --> 10:49.854
I figured it out.

10:49.921 --> 10:52.089
This guy's your Kryptonite.

10:52.157 --> 10:55.226
You need to stand up,
and you need to fight him.

10:55.293 --> 10:57.928
I tried to fight him, but I
can't, 'cause I'm powerless.

10:57.996 --> 10:59.163
'Cause you're not ready
to let him go.

10:59.231 --> 11:01.232
I think you know deep down,

11:01.299 --> 11:02.867
once you get
your stuff back,

11:02.934 --> 11:05.036
you know, it's over over.

11:05.103 --> 11:06.570
CECE:
I can't believe

11:06.638 --> 11:08.205
I'm actually gonna say this,

11:08.273 --> 11:10.608
but I agree with him.

11:13.679 --> 11:15.146
No, you guys are wrong.

11:15.213 --> 11:17.281
I really...
I really want to move on.

11:17.349 --> 11:19.383
- Then you got to fight.
- All right, I want to fight.

11:19.451 --> 11:20.951
- And get mad.
- I want to get mad.

11:21.019 --> 11:22.453
All right,
then let's do this.

11:22.521 --> 11:24.388
Pretend this is
Spencer's face. Punch it.

11:27.891 --> 11:28.926
Get him.

11:31.096 --> 11:33.130
Come on, do it again.

11:33.196 --> 11:34.066
Punch it like a man...

11:34.196 --> 11:36.266
- Harder than that!
- C'mom, Jess.

11:36.396 --> 11:37.466
C'mon, Jess. Get angry!

11:37.569 --> 11:39.304
- Good!
- Get angry! <i>Real</i> angry.

11:39.305 --> 11:41.071
That's dancing,
that's punch-dancing.

11:41.172 --> 11:42.373
He broke your heart.

11:42.441 --> 11:43.708
He did terrible things to you.
You hate him.

11:44.275 --> 11:45.176
I'm mad!

11:45.243 --> 11:47.078
- Good! - <i>There you go.</i>
- I'm bad!

11:47.145 --> 11:48.512
You're ready.
Go get your stuff.

11:48.580 --> 11:50.381
- I'm gonna go get my stuff!
- Go get him!

11:50.449 --> 11:51.515
Come on, Jess.

11:51.583 --> 11:52.583
JESS:
I'm really mad!

11:52.651 --> 11:54.084
NICK: Proud of you.
- Gonna go get it!

11:54.152 --> 11:55.419
Get your stuff.

11:55.487 --> 11:57.154
I'm gonna face the facts.

11:57.222 --> 12:00.891
I'm gonna ask you guys
right now to come with me.

12:03.459 --> 12:04.495
Seriously, guys.

12:04.563 --> 12:06.230
- All right, yeah, yeah.
- 'Cause I can't carry everything alone,

12:06.298 --> 12:08.065
and I can't be alone.

12:08.133 --> 12:09.500
(heavy metal music playing)

12:09.568 --> 12:11.936
Yeah! Loud music!

12:12.003 --> 12:15.473
Loud. It's loud.

12:15.540 --> 12:17.208
Okay, you are ruining
my pre-game mix.

12:17.275 --> 12:20.678
- What am I gonna say?
- Hey, Spencer, give me my TV back.

12:20.746 --> 12:22.780
Hi, Spencer.
Give me my TV back, buddy.

12:22.848 --> 12:24.849
No "buddy."
How about "jerk" or "idiot"?

12:24.916 --> 12:26.016
Mr. Crabs.

12:26.084 --> 12:28.085
Mr. Crabs is an option.

12:28.153 --> 12:29.687
Your hand is on my leg.

12:29.755 --> 12:31.388
Oh, your hand's on my leg.

12:31.456 --> 12:32.990
No, it really isn't.

12:33.058 --> 12:35.392
Classic he said, she said.

12:35.460 --> 12:37.762
Okay, Jess, just pull over
right there.

12:40.298 --> 12:42.066
(engine revving)

12:42.134 --> 12:43.968
What are you doing?
It was right there.

12:44.035 --> 12:45.736
JESS: Okay, you know what?
Just one more shot.

12:45.804 --> 12:49.073
One more time around, Jess, and
then we're good. You got this.

12:49.141 --> 12:50.641
Here we go.
This is the one.

12:50.709 --> 12:52.943
All right, you got this,
Jess. Come on.

12:55.147 --> 12:56.580
- I...
- Just one more time.

12:56.648 --> 12:58.215
(sighs)

12:58.283 --> 13:00.484
...didn't want
to, you know.

13:00.552 --> 13:02.920
Ok this is the time,
this is the time...

13:02.988 --> 13:04.421
One more shot, one more shot.

13:04.489 --> 13:06.490
Just one more.
Just one more.

13:06.558 --> 13:08.692
- You know, I'm on to you.
- What do you mean?

13:08.760 --> 13:10.528
Okay, you told me
that I'm top dog,

13:10.595 --> 13:12.863
but secretly, you think
you're top dog, all right?

13:12.931 --> 13:15.666
And now you're just trying
to out-top dog the top dog.

13:15.734 --> 13:17.501
Jess, can you please take
these doors off child-lock

13:17.568 --> 13:18.369
so I can kill myself?

13:18.436 --> 13:20.037
Men working.

13:20.105 --> 13:21.739
Look, things are different
now, man, all right?

13:21.807 --> 13:23.507
You're not top dog anymore.
I am.

13:23.575 --> 13:25.276
Okay, you know what?
You are absolutely correct.

13:25.343 --> 13:26.877
You are the top dog.

13:26.945 --> 13:29.345
- Here.
- What are you doing?

13:29.913 --> 13:31.380
There's no top dog crown.

13:31.448 --> 13:32.883
What, are you trying
to make me look stupid?

13:32.951 --> 13:35.252
Look, man,
this is about respect.

13:35.320 --> 13:37.021
I'm a lot flyer
than I used to be.

13:37.088 --> 13:38.422
Yeah, much flyer.
I respect you, Schmidt.

13:38.490 --> 13:39.990
No, you don't.

13:40.058 --> 13:42.193
Because if you did,
you would have told me

13:42.260 --> 13:44.461
that the small room
is the top dog room.

13:44.529 --> 13:46.764
(song changes to
"Save the Best For Last")

13:46.832 --> 13:52.469
(humming along)

13:52.537 --> 13:55.172
♪ Just when I thought
our chance had past ♪

13:55.240 --> 13:56.974
What? I own this song.

13:57.042 --> 14:03.180
♪ You go and save
the best for last... ♪

14:03.248 --> 14:07.117
(whooping and cheering)

14:07.185 --> 14:08.719
What's happening?

14:08.787 --> 14:10.955
What's happening is
that this is a great song.

14:14.825 --> 14:17.193
CECE: I'll be out here
if you need me, Jess.

14:23.334 --> 14:26.568
(doorbell rings
repeatedly and rapidly)

14:27.806 --> 14:30.174
Oh, hey, Jess-Jess.

14:30.242 --> 14:33.177
That's the wizard?
He's wearing a scrunchie.

14:33.245 --> 14:35.379
WINSTON: Looks like he
juggles clubs on the beach.

14:35.447 --> 14:36.981
Yeah, like he'd
ever have a job.

14:37.048 --> 14:38.549
Didn't you just kind of assume

14:38.617 --> 14:40.484
he'd have a handlebar moustache?

14:40.552 --> 14:42.987
Come on, Jess, just go in there
and get that TV.

14:43.054 --> 14:44.355
(sighing)

14:44.422 --> 14:45.789
I miss you, Jess.

14:45.857 --> 14:47.324
CECE:
Don't hug him back.

14:47.392 --> 14:49.293
(group groaning)

14:49.361 --> 14:50.928
- Ugh!
(sighs) - Oh, that's not good.

14:54.298 --> 14:56.367
I told you to water the plants.

14:56.434 --> 14:58.736
Huh? Oh. Oh, you know
it's not my thing.

14:59.803 --> 15:01.071
I told you to water the plants.

15:03.275 --> 15:05.276
What is she doing?

15:05.343 --> 15:09.513
(grunting)

15:09.581 --> 15:11.515
ALL: Oh! Oh, what a mess!

15:11.583 --> 15:12.917
(yelling)

15:12.984 --> 15:14.418
I'm coming in!

15:14.486 --> 15:16.220
Jess, take your shoes off!

15:16.288 --> 15:17.922
We keep an Asian household.

15:17.989 --> 15:19.390
Didn't see that coming.

15:20.657 --> 15:23.327
She going to be
okay in there?

15:23.395 --> 15:25.429
(loud thudding)

15:25.497 --> 15:27.598
(metal clinking)

15:27.666 --> 15:29.867
(loud thudding)

15:29.935 --> 15:31.368
(cat yowling)

15:34.271 --> 15:35.439
I've got it!

15:36.507 --> 15:38.042
It's really heavy, but I got it!

15:38.109 --> 15:40.577
Oh, my God,
we created a monster.

15:41.945 --> 15:44.181
NICK: She looks like
Helena Bonham Carter.

15:45.049 --> 15:46.649
Soft hands, Jess.

15:46.717 --> 15:48.585
Jess, come on, let's share it.
You know, work out a system.

15:49.653 --> 15:52.255
Hey...
Hey, that's my shirt.

15:52.724 --> 15:55.592
- No, this is my T-shirt.
- No, that is my shirt.

15:55.660 --> 15:56.327
It has my name on it.

15:56.394 --> 15:57.494
Don't drop it.
Jess, don't...

15:57.562 --> 15:59.330
Don't drop the...
No, no, no...

15:59.397 --> 16:00.864
CECE:
Come on, everybody out now.

16:01.932 --> 16:04.435
- Ugh! Give me my shirt!
- Come on, I like this shirt.

16:04.502 --> 16:06.770
Hey, Jess, no, no, no, no,
no, stop, stop, stop, stop.

16:06.838 --> 16:09.072
Sorry. Don't mind us, pal.
We're just here for the TV.

16:09.140 --> 16:10.841
- Who are these guys?
- They're my roommates.

16:10.909 --> 16:13.744
- Cece, hi. - I'm gonna go in and
get the rest of your stuff, Jess.

16:13.812 --> 16:15.645
Wait, Jess, let's just talk
about this, okay?

16:15.713 --> 16:16.914
You know, rap it out.

16:16.982 --> 16:18.682
No, we can rap it out.
We're not together anymore.

16:18.749 --> 16:19.717
It's not the same.

16:19.784 --> 16:21.719
It doesn't mean
we can't talk about things.

16:21.786 --> 16:23.821
There's nothing to talk about.
Give me my shirt back.

16:24.288 --> 16:26.025
No, you gave this to me.
I want to keep it.

16:26.888 --> 16:28.325
Give her her T-shirt, man.

16:28.393 --> 16:30.460
No, I don't want to, you know,
and I gave her this hat, too,

16:30.528 --> 16:31.495
so I'm gonna take this back.

16:31.563 --> 16:32.863
- This one? - Yeah.
- You want that?

16:32.931 --> 16:34.164
- Yeah.
- Then I dare you--

16:34.232 --> 16:35.599
come take it off my head, pal.

16:38.936 --> 16:39.870
I dare you.

16:44.109 --> 16:45.542
You guys look ridiculous.

16:45.610 --> 16:47.111
Look, dude,
give her the shirt back.

16:47.178 --> 16:48.812
I bet she worked hard
on that jamboree.

16:48.880 --> 16:51.949
Yeah, it's a play
on words-- Jam-boree.

16:52.017 --> 16:52.816
- Jam.
- Jam.

16:52.884 --> 16:55.686
Girl made a lot of jam, Spence.

16:55.754 --> 16:57.621
You know how time-consuming
that can be?

16:57.689 --> 16:59.957
You need a jar funnel, a canner,

17:00.025 --> 17:03.093
some fresh fruit--
strawberries, raspberries,

17:03.160 --> 17:05.362
maybe a tayberry,
maybe a ripe...

17:05.430 --> 17:06.066
No more fruit, Schmidt.

17:06.130 --> 17:08.866
You live with these people, Jess?
Seriously?

17:08.933 --> 17:10.768
You can stay here until you find
a better place to live.

17:10.835 --> 17:12.202
You know what?
I don't like you, stretch.

17:13.069 --> 17:14.104
I don't like anything

17:14.172 --> 17:17.441
- about you, and I'm not afraid to...
- I got this.

17:21.112 --> 17:23.012
I've got a place to live,
Spence.

17:23.580 --> 17:25.382
It's over.

17:25.449 --> 17:26.983
I spent six years

17:27.050 --> 17:28.885
trying to figure you out.

17:28.953 --> 17:30.921
All you are is a guy

17:30.988 --> 17:33.089
with really
beautiful hair.

17:33.157 --> 17:34.524
I'm happy you cheated on me.

17:35.092 --> 17:36.259
Thank you.

17:36.327 --> 17:39.963
Because if you hadn't,
I would have married you.

17:40.031 --> 17:42.265
And then you would have
hurt me all over again.

17:44.335 --> 17:46.870
(sighs) And, yeah, I was
scared to start over.

17:46.938 --> 17:48.605
I didn't know
what to do,

17:48.673 --> 17:50.808
and yeah, I'm living with three
guys I met on the Internet.

17:50.875 --> 17:53.143
And yeah,
stranger danger is real.

17:53.210 --> 17:54.911
But I love these guys.

17:56.514 --> 17:58.548
I barely know them,

17:58.616 --> 18:00.084
I just met him,

18:00.452 --> 18:01.919
but I love them.

18:01.986 --> 18:03.520
NICK: I would just take it
easy with the love stuff.

18:03.588 --> 18:06.022
All of them.

18:09.760 --> 18:11.861
Give her the
shirt back, man.

18:15.833 --> 18:16.866
What happens if I say no?

18:16.934 --> 18:19.235
You know what happens?

18:19.303 --> 18:20.904
Schmidt happens!

18:20.972 --> 18:22.439
Ow!

18:22.506 --> 18:23.873
What was on your hand?

18:23.941 --> 18:25.208
Thumb ring, bitch.

18:25.276 --> 18:27.010
You got some
Schmidt on your face.

18:28.679 --> 18:31.448
You know what? Fine!
Here, take it!

18:32.917 --> 18:34.317
- Keep the bell.
- What?

18:37.121 --> 18:39.723
You know, I thought we were gonna
handle this like adults, Jess.

18:39.790 --> 18:42.892
Yeah, well, I thought you were
the love of my life, so...

18:44.996 --> 18:48.131
Suck it, Mr. Crabs.

19:01.526 --> 19:03.060
You hit that guy.

19:03.928 --> 19:05.562
Whatever. You know.

19:05.630 --> 19:06.963
(laughs)

19:07.031 --> 19:08.665
You know what?

19:08.733 --> 19:11.668
Maybe I didn't have respect
for you before, because

19:11.736 --> 19:14.070
if this is what
respecting you feels like,

19:14.138 --> 19:16.540
this is definitely
not how I felt.

19:16.607 --> 19:20.544
So, you recognize.
Represent, what?

19:20.611 --> 19:22.979
Okay, look, I'm gonna be
completely honest.

19:23.047 --> 19:24.348
I've been messing with you.

19:24.416 --> 19:26.517
But it's just that
I wanted my old room back.

19:26.584 --> 19:28.552
You know, you're right.

19:28.620 --> 19:30.654
I've been away a long time, and
things have changed around here,

19:30.722 --> 19:32.956
so I guess I kind of
got to get used to that.

19:33.024 --> 19:34.658
You can keep the big room.

19:34.726 --> 19:37.628
See, now you're just
deep dogging me, man.

19:37.696 --> 19:40.597
I'm not scared of
your mind games.

19:40.665 --> 19:43.534
I'm taking the small room,
Winston.

19:43.601 --> 19:45.436
Schmidt, that's not
what I mean, but...

19:45.503 --> 19:47.171
No, no, no, no, no. Why don't
you listen to what I mean?

19:47.238 --> 19:51.208
You can double reverse dog me
until the cows come home.

19:51.276 --> 19:53.310
I'm not falling for it.

19:53.378 --> 19:55.112
What do you
take me for,

19:55.180 --> 19:57.114
some kind of idiot?

19:58.851 --> 20:00.985
(quietly):
Yes.

20:04.756 --> 20:06.824
Can't believe
I got all my stuff back.

20:06.891 --> 20:09.594
You did,
but most of it's broken.

20:09.661 --> 20:13.430
Yeah, it's broken, but--
I don't know-- it's mine.

20:13.498 --> 20:16.400
Yeah, but it's broken.
Hey, look at that.

20:16.468 --> 20:18.102
- I think it's working.
- Oh, my God!

20:18.169 --> 20:20.154
- We got a TV again.
- It's a TV, and it's working.

20:20.171 --> 20:23.207
Hey, we got the TV back!

20:23.274 --> 20:25.976
All right!

20:26.044 --> 20:27.345
JESS:
You guys are awesome.

20:27.412 --> 20:29.480
I'm going to make you
so much jam.

20:29.547 --> 20:31.181
Please don't.

20:31.249 --> 20:32.850
♪ Oh, we're gonna have
a jam sess. ♪

20:32.917 --> 20:34.184
Absolutely not.

20:38.155 --> 20:39.923
Okay, what
are we watching?

20:39.991 --> 20:41.625
I have some DVDs.

20:41.693 --> 20:43.694
Um, <i>Adventures</i>
<i>in Babysitting,</i>

20:43.762 --> 20:47.231
uh, <i>Prancer,</i>
<i>Newsies, Curly Sue.</i>

20:47.298 --> 20:48.899
I'm going out.

20:48.967 --> 20:51.568
Yeah.

20:51.636 --> 20:54.705
Wait. Where are you guys going?

20:55.773 --> 20:57.674
These are heartwarming films.

21:02.511 --> 21:04.979
- <i>Curly Sue.</i> Let's do this.
- All right, let me go get it.
