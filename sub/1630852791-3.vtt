- Look.

01:42.068 --> 01:43.202
- [chuckles]
- He's in the trees guys.

01:43.204 --> 01:44.470

He's up there.

<i>[Bill] The Grafton monster,
he was first spotted in 1960.</i>

01:55.282 --> 01:58.484
He's been roaming these
Appalachian mountains ever since.

01:58.486 --> 02:00.586
He's airborne, boys.
He's airborne.

02:00.588 --> 02:02.087
Big bastard's up there.

02:02.089 --> 02:06.658
We're tracking that hairy bastard
and right now, he's up a damn tree.

02:06.660 --> 02:09.228
He climbed up the damn tree right
there, he's gotta be in there somewhere.

02:09.230 --> 02:11.697
- Anything, Jeff?
- [Jeff] No, I'm not seeing anything.

02:11.699 --> 02:15.234
- You keep watching up high, I'll keep on the ground.
- [all shouting]

02:15.236 --> 02:17.236
- Keep your eyes on him.
- He likes to feed above, guys.

02:17.238 --> 02:19.171
He'd like to feed up there.

02:19.173 --> 02:20.606
[Bill] Where the hell
did that thing go to?

02:20.608 --> 02:22.841
I bet he went
right through here. Right...

02:22.843 --> 02:24.276
-Hey, hey, hey...
-[both] What you got? What you got?

02:24.278 --> 02:25.911

02:25.913 --> 02:27.579
- Oh, hell yeah.
- Geez.

02:27.581 --> 02:29.181
[Buck] Yeah! Go on dude!

02:29.183 --> 02:31.984
[Willy] Hell, he come down the
damn thing right there. Didn't he?

02:31.986 --> 02:33.919
All of sudden
Willy starts squalling,

02:33.921 --> 02:35.654
we look over and there it is.

02:35.656 --> 02:36.788
Look at those claw marks.

02:36.790 --> 02:38.323
Look how deep they go in.

02:38.325 --> 02:40.826
[Buck] Huge claw marks
coming down this big maple tree.

02:40.828 --> 02:42.995
He's back on the ground, boys.

02:42.997 --> 02:45.397
That Grafton monster
is trying to pull one on us.

02:45.399 --> 02:47.933
- [Bill] Where did it go Buck?
- Hey, look here, look here.

02:47.935 --> 02:49.301
He broke this. This is fresh.

02:49.303 --> 02:50.836
Look at that.
That just happened.

02:50.838 --> 02:52.404
These leaves are all kicked up.

02:52.406 --> 02:54.139
Hey, up here, look up here,
look up here.

02:54.141 --> 02:55.040

- Yeah.
- We guys back on the trail.

02:56.677 --> 02:58.410
[Bill] Look at this.
He kicked the whole log up.

02:58.412 --> 03:00.145
Where the hell is it going now?

03:00.147 --> 03:01.346
Right up through there
somewhere.

03:01.348 --> 03:03.348
Oh, hold up, hold up,
hold up, hold up.

03:03.350 --> 03:05.150
He just made a giant U-turn.

03:05.152 --> 03:07.085
- Damn straight, he did.
- Oh yeah.

03:07.087 --> 03:09.254
He's going straight back
towards Terry's farm.

03:09.656 --> 03:10.956
He's backtracking.

03:11.424 --> 03:13.192
- Yeah, yes.
- This ain't good.

03:13.194 --> 03:14.660
He's going after another cow.

03:14.662 --> 03:15.827
- Yeah.
- Yes, he is.

03:15.829 --> 03:17.863
That cow-killing bastard.

03:17.865 --> 03:19.531
We've underestimated
this son of a bitch.

03:19.533 --> 03:21.967
He's way smarter
than we give him credit for.

03:21.969 --> 03:23.235
He outfoxed us.

03:23.436 --> 03:25.137
Exactly right.

03:25.139 --> 03:26.438
You guys kick your lights off.

03:26.873 --> 03:28.073
Go to IR.

03:28.075 --> 03:29.374
We're not stalking no more.

03:29.376 --> 03:30.776
- Now we're hunting.
- [Willy] Yeah.

03:30.778 --> 03:32.144
- [Bill] Hell yeah.
- Let's go.

03:32.146 --> 03:33.579
[Bill] Let's run
that ass off him.

03:33.581 --> 03:34.913
<i>[Huck] This Grafton monster</i>

03:34.915 --> 03:37.849
<i>is a hell of a lot smarter
than we give him credit for.</i>

03:37.851 --> 03:40.285
That son of a bitch
climbed up this one tree,

03:40.287 --> 03:42.354
jumped over here
to this maple tree,

03:42.356 --> 03:45.390
slid down with great,
big claws in the bark,

03:45.392 --> 03:47.659
<i>and headed right back
to that barn.</i>

03:47.661 --> 03:49.361
We need to get back to that barn

03:49.363 --> 03:51.330
before he ends up killing
another cow.

03:51.332 --> 03:53.632
Oh, he'd be wiping Terry's
damn cows out.

03:53.634 --> 03:55.334
Let me tell you what.

03:55.336 --> 03:59.171
This AIMS team, we're gonna run this
son of a bitch till its tongue hangs out...

03:59.173 --> 04:01.039
Let's go. The farm's
not too far guys.

04:01.041 --> 04:04.343
and I'm gonna kick this son of
a bitch's ass from the Tygart valley

04:04.345 --> 04:05.978
to the gates of hell.

04:07.113 --> 04:09.348
Guys, I'm seeing the barn
right here.

04:09.350 --> 04:11.383
This might be
the backside of Terry's farm.

04:11.385 --> 04:13.218
- Oh yeah, this is definitely Terry's farm.
- Yeah.

04:13.220 --> 04:14.486
- Oh yeah.
- We just gotta figure out

04:14.488 --> 04:16.121
where in the hell
that headless horror went.

04:16.256 --> 04:18.023
Hey, there's some lights.

04:18.025 --> 04:20.659
Hold up guys. I got headlights.
Hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up.

04:20.661 --> 04:23.295
- What in the hell is this?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

04:23.297 --> 04:25.030
- Watch out guys.
- Now, easy.

04:25.032 --> 04:26.932
- [clamoring]
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa...

04:26.934 --> 04:29.935
[Terry] I thought you guys is going to
get rid of that damn Grafton monster.

04:29.937 --> 04:30.369
That's Terry.

04:30.371 --> 04:31.870
[all] Terry.

04:31.872 --> 04:34.306
- [clamoring] - [Buck]
Oh you got a gun brother.

04:34.308 --> 04:35.907
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- [Terry] That damn Grafton monster's

04:35.909 --> 04:37.309
right around the damn building.

04:37.311 --> 04:39.945
- Son of a bitch.
- Man, the dog was out here,

04:39.947 --> 04:43.248
that damn dog ran into the house,
run clearing the [bleep] damn bedroom,

04:43.250 --> 04:44.283
ran under the bed,

04:44.285 --> 04:46.118
been [bleeping] on the floor.

04:46.120 --> 04:48.954
That would be a month before I
can get that smell out of my house.

04:49.188 --> 04:50.355
- Damn.
- Wow man.

04:50.357 --> 04:52.324
I'm pissed of bigger [bleep].

04:52.326 --> 04:54.660
We was down following it through
the woods, we was tracking it.

04:54.662 --> 04:56.395
Well, he come up this way.

04:56.397 --> 04:58.463
He turned and then
he came back up here.

05:02.135 --> 05:03.502
Terry, what's on your dashboard?

05:04.270 --> 05:05.971
That's my glowsticks.

05:05.973 --> 05:07.873
Amy got an ass load of them,
don't she?

05:07.875 --> 05:09.775
What are you doing
with glowsticks?

05:09.777 --> 05:11.276
- Yeah, what were you doing?
- Well, I got a feeling that

05:11.278 --> 05:13.979
that Grafton monster's afraid
of them sons of bitches.

05:13.981 --> 05:15.947
[Buck] What? You think the
Grafton monster's afraid of--

05:15.949 --> 05:18.083
I think it messes with
his damn eyeballs.

05:19.819 --> 05:21.486
Wow. That's a new one.

05:21.488 --> 05:23.088
What makes you think that?

05:23.556 --> 05:25.057
It... it's just my hunch.

05:26.659 --> 05:29.628
- [chuckles] - Call this a
hunch, or call it a theory,

05:29.630 --> 05:31.797
it's afraid of all this
different color.

05:31.799 --> 05:34.633
It just like, messes with him,
big time.

05:34.635 --> 05:37.336
Son of a bitch! I'm losing
these all over the place.

05:37.338 --> 05:39.938
He's eyes are accustomed to
seeing after dark

05:39.940 --> 05:42.107
and seeing during
the daytime and [bleep].

05:42.109 --> 05:44.776
And then you got them rods
and them cones and things.

05:44.778 --> 05:47.245
And it got
different wavelengths.

05:47.247 --> 05:50.182
That I think, the wavelengths on
them are messing with his eyes.

05:50.184 --> 05:51.450
That's my theory.

05:56.856 --> 05:59.291
Well...[stammers] Okay.

06:01.027 --> 06:02.093
<i>[Terry] Damn it.</i>

06:02.095 --> 06:04.529
<i>I might have to
take these daggone glowsticks</i>

06:04.531 --> 06:06.932
and I might have to put them
on every damn thing in my farm.

06:06.934 --> 06:10.769
I might have to put them
on the dog, on the cattle, hell,

06:10.771 --> 06:13.705
might have to go get to the neighbors
and put them on to their damn pigs.

06:13.707 --> 06:17.242
This has got me fit to
be tied, I'm losing cattle,

06:17.244 --> 06:20.379
I gotta be out here half the night,
making sure everything's okay.

06:20.381 --> 06:22.147
I'm losing sleep, dammit.

06:22.149 --> 06:25.016
- And I'm old.
- You definitely need some sleep.

06:25.018 --> 06:27.285
- [Bill] Yeah.
- [bleep] I want to go to bed at night.

06:27.287 --> 06:30.989
I'll tell you what Terry, I'm gonna
give you my word and me and this team,

06:30.991 --> 06:33.625
we're gonna clear the farm
from one end to the other.

06:33.627 --> 06:35.360
We'll get him the hell
outta here for you, bro.

06:35.362 --> 06:38.130
I sure to hell hope so because
I'd hate to have to come out here,

06:38.132 --> 06:40.365
with guns blazing
every damn night.

06:40.367 --> 06:43.869
-I got-- -I'm wound up
like... a tight rubber-band.

06:43.871 --> 06:45.337
Okay. We see that.

06:45.339 --> 06:47.739
Hey Terry, where's
the last place you seen him?

06:47.741 --> 06:50.242
Last place I see him, was right
back here behind these here barns.

06:50.244 --> 06:52.644
I think he's back here
in the barn somewhere.

06:52.646 --> 06:55.280
Okay. Guys, here's what
we need to do.

06:55.282 --> 06:58.116
Willy, Bill, want you guys
start up here on the north end.

06:58.118 --> 07:00.886
He's got a whole pile
of barns and sheds up here.

07:00.888 --> 07:02.254
-Start clearing it. Every bit of it.
-Yes, sir.

07:02.256 --> 07:04.256
- Yes sir.
- Huck, Jeff...

07:04.258 --> 07:07.459
- Yeah.
- we're gonna start this way right where he just seen him.

07:07.461 --> 07:09.294
- We're gonna go start clearing down there.
- [both] All right.

07:09.296 --> 07:10.428
- Yup.
- All right.

07:10.430 --> 07:12.130
Well, I hope like hell,
you get that son of a bitch.

07:12.132 --> 07:14.199
You get him moved down
dead on to the road.

07:14.201 --> 07:17.903
Terry, you have
the AIMS team's word.

07:17.905 --> 07:19.838
We'll run this wooly bugger
outta here.

07:19.840 --> 07:21.273
I'm depending on you fellows.

07:21.275 --> 07:23.275
-[Bill] Damn right. We'll go and get it done.
-[Huck] All right.

07:23.277 --> 07:25.644
The Grafton monster may think
he pulled one on us,

07:25.646 --> 07:27.379
<i>but he's gonna have to get up
a little earlier.</i>

07:27.381 --> 07:30.549
All right AIMS team, let's
clear this farm for Terry.

07:30.551 --> 07:33.418
We're five ugly
hillbilly detectives

07:33.420 --> 07:34.653
and we're coming after it.

07:34.655 --> 07:36.054
- Hell yeah.
- Hell yes.

07:36.056 --> 07:38.523
- Come on...
- You guys remember what he did to us.

07:38.525 --> 07:39.958
All right fellows.

07:40.126 --> 07:41.359
Good hunting.

07:42.662 --> 07:44.996
Boys we got lot of areas
to clear.

07:45.665 --> 07:49.067
Yes we do.
Yes, some big buildings here.

07:49.069 --> 07:52.204
You got to remember,
that Grafton monster climbs.

07:52.972 --> 07:54.039
Hey Huck,

07:55.007 --> 07:56.441
you're right.

07:56.443 --> 07:59.411
We may wanna keep a little
distance between us and these barns.

07:59.413 --> 08:01.813
<i>[Huck] I suggest that, yeah.</i>

08:01.815 --> 08:03.815
Just check out that
with your thermal.

08:03.817 --> 08:06.218
Make sure you hit
all these barns up on top.

08:06.220 --> 08:08.453
<i>[Jeff] Yeah, I'm right
on top of these buildings.</i>

08:09.922 --> 08:11.490
Jeff, we clear?

08:11.492 --> 08:13.358
- Yeah, this was clear.
- All right.

08:13.360 --> 08:14.626
- Let's get moving.
- All right.

08:15.461 --> 08:16.661
We got a lot of work
ahead of us.

08:18.831 --> 08:21.366
Well, Terry was fired up
as hell, wasn't he?

08:21.368 --> 08:25.003
When you start losing that many
cows, [chuckles], that gets you fired up.

08:25.005 --> 08:28.206
Son of a bitch, hey,
I made him a promise.

08:28.208 --> 08:30.809
By God, we clear this farm,
from one end to the other,

08:30.811 --> 08:32.143
every inch of it.

08:32.145 --> 08:34.513
By God, we're gonna start
right at this barn.

08:34.515 --> 08:36.081
- All right, we're getting there.
- Ready?

08:36.083 --> 08:37.916
A promise is a promise.

08:37.918 --> 08:39.951
Clear the top.
Clear down here.

08:41.187 --> 08:41.920
Clear.

08:41.922 --> 08:42.420
<i>As a marine...</i>

08:42.422 --> 08:43.355
- [thuds]
- Clear!

08:43.456 --> 08:45.323
<i>[Bill] I'm not gonna
half-ass anything.</i>

08:45.325 --> 08:46.925
Crystal clear over here, Willy.

08:46.927 --> 08:48.360
Clear's about here, brother.

08:48.362 --> 08:51.062
Clear as spring water
water over here.

08:51.064 --> 08:54.132
I'm gonna go full board or none.

08:54.134 --> 08:56.167
Clear behind the grass
out here, Willy.

08:56.169 --> 08:57.269
Clear behind the tractor.

08:57.271 --> 08:59.004
Bill's clearing everything.

08:59.672 --> 09:01.273
Clear. Clear underneath.

09:01.275 --> 09:04.042
Clear under here.
Let's keep clearing.

09:04.044 --> 09:06.344
He's up by the feed troughs,
the water troughs.

09:06.346 --> 09:07.512
[Bill] Clear!

09:07.880 --> 09:09.481
<i>[Willy] Hell, he's even
clearing the refrigerator.</i>

09:09.483 --> 09:11.383
- Clear!
- And the freezer.

09:13.219 --> 09:15.186
[shouting] Ice box is clear.

09:15.188 --> 09:17.422
Man, he's taking this
clearing seriously.

09:17.424 --> 09:18.990
- Let's keep working up this way.
- Hold up.

09:18.992 --> 09:21.126
I got your back.

09:21.128 --> 09:22.928
He could be right in this
big, tall grass.

09:22.930 --> 09:24.963
- [Bill] Damn right.
- He comes up outta here...

09:25.898 --> 09:26.932
holy [bleep].

09:26.934 --> 09:28.667
- [thuds]
- Holy [bleep].

09:28.669 --> 09:30.201
Weapons up, pull the weapons up.

09:30.203 --> 09:31.803
- Be careful.
- I bet he's come from right in there.

09:31.805 --> 09:33.371
Come from right inside
this barn.

09:33.373 --> 09:34.506
Well, what the hell
are we doing?

09:35.041 --> 09:36.308
Be careful.

09:37.510 --> 09:39.344
I think he's backing
through here.

09:39.346 --> 09:41.012
That son of a bitch
can be anywhere.

09:43.149 --> 09:44.149
Easy Willy, easy.

09:44.151 --> 09:45.884
All right.

09:45.886 --> 09:47.252
- Hey, where the hell are you?
- Easy Will, easy.

09:48.054 --> 09:49.487
That big bastard.

09:51.023 --> 09:54.125
That noise sounded like it was coming
from right back up in through here.

09:54.660 --> 09:56.895
What the hell we're doing man?

09:56.897 --> 09:58.563
Easy does it. Easy.
Easy, easy, easy.

09:59.932 --> 10:01.266
[bleep]

10:01.268 --> 10:02.934
- There's a whole way up and around.
- [thuds]

10:02.936 --> 10:04.169
- Whoa!
- [bleep]

10:04.171 --> 10:05.203
- Oh!
- What was that?

10:05.205 --> 10:06.871
Sone of a bitch,
something right there!

10:06.873 --> 10:09.107
Watch out!
He's right above us.

10:10.910 --> 10:12.477
Easy does it. Easy.
Easy, easy, easy.

10:14.146 --> 10:15.146
[bleep]

10:15.148 --> 10:16.448
There's a whole way
up and around.

10:16.450 --> 10:18.183
- [thuds]
- Oh...[bleep]

10:18.185 --> 10:19.184
- Oh.
- What was that?

10:19.186 --> 10:20.418
Son of a bitch, I'm right there.

10:20.420 --> 10:22.420
-All right. He's down right there.
-Watch out.

10:23.022 --> 10:24.255
You see that silo up there?

10:24.257 --> 10:26.291
[Jeff] Yeah,
I'm not seeing anything.

10:26.293 --> 10:28.193
<i>- It's clear.
- [Huck] Stay ready, stay ready.</i>

10:28.195 --> 10:30.395
Keep checking that thermal.
That sounded like it's up high.

10:30.397 --> 10:31.630
Oh yeah,
I've been looking, Buck.

10:33.232 --> 10:35.033
- Damn.
- [Buck] Let's go there and check this out.

10:36.202 --> 10:38.403
Is that damn thing
on the roof or what?

10:38.405 --> 10:40.138
[Willy] Could be.
I don't see it in here.

10:40.140 --> 10:41.840
<i>[Bill] We're currently staying
in the building.</i>

10:41.842 --> 10:43.842
We all damn know
he's way up high.

10:43.844 --> 10:45.276
<i>I don't know where the hell
it's coming from.</i>

10:45.278 --> 10:47.779
<i>On top of this hay,
on that roof.</i>

10:47.781 --> 10:49.180
By god, we better watch our ass.

10:49.182 --> 10:51.750
There ain't no way we can get
up on these hay bales like this.

10:51.752 --> 10:53.284
We're gonna have to
work ourselves around.

10:53.286 --> 10:56.087
By god, let's get to working
around. I got you covered.

10:56.756 --> 10:58.289
Watch out, I'm coming in.

10:58.291 --> 11:00.125
There ain't no way in hell
we can get on top of this hay.

11:00.127 --> 11:02.327
[grunting]

11:02.329 --> 11:04.362
<i>[Willy] So, we're gonna
work back around this barn...</i>

11:04.364 --> 11:07.332
- Come on Batman.
- and see if we can check the other side.

11:07.334 --> 11:09.601
Watch that roof, watch that
roof, Willy watch the roof.

11:10.803 --> 11:12.504
Jeff, keep working that thermal.

11:12.506 --> 11:15.040
<i>[Jeff] Yeah, I am. I'm looking at these
roofs, Buck. I'm not seeing anything.</i>

11:15.808 --> 11:17.342
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.

11:18.377 --> 11:20.445
- [Buck] You heard that?
- [Huck] Yes, I heard.

11:21.580 --> 11:23.148
- [thuds]
- Ho, ho, ho...[bleep]

11:23.150 --> 11:25.050
[Buck] That's around at the
right guys, just around to the right.

11:25.052 --> 11:27.485
Okay, Buck. Take your time.

11:27.487 --> 11:30.321
<i>That silo's 90 feet. How
can it be that high up there?</i>

11:30.323 --> 11:32.290
<i>Sounds like he's
all the way to the top.</i>

11:32.925 --> 11:34.192
Jeff, can you see anything?

11:34.194 --> 11:35.560
I'm not seeing anything.

11:37.163 --> 11:38.997
- [Buck] Look here.
- [Jeff] Easy, easy.

11:38.999 --> 11:40.565
- See these bands?
- [Jeff] Yeah.

11:42.301 --> 11:44.102
Right here's how he can
climb up, guys.

11:44.104 --> 11:46.271
[Jeff] Yeah, I see now, Buck.

11:46.273 --> 11:48.907
He get a hand and toe hold on
that he could ride up the side of that.

11:48.909 --> 11:50.508
- [thuds]
- Oh...[bleep]

11:50.510 --> 11:52.343
- That's right over here.
- [Jeff] It's over this way.

11:52.878 --> 11:53.978
Way to go. Stay ready.

11:53.980 --> 11:55.113
Jeff, start clearing this barn.

11:55.115 --> 11:56.681
Yeah, let me get this
barn cleared out man.

11:56.683 --> 11:57.882
[Buck] The cattle are spooked.

11:57.884 --> 11:59.150
[Huck] Oh yes, they are.

11:59.152 --> 12:00.418
Keep your eyes.

12:01.020 --> 12:02.353
See anything Jeffro?

12:02.355 --> 12:03.621
- Yeah.
- It's clear.

12:08.327 --> 12:09.360
Oh.

12:09.962 --> 12:11.629
What are you thinking, Buck?

12:11.631 --> 12:13.732
I'm thinking the silo's
right there.

12:13.734 --> 12:16.134
And it sound like something
was on top of it.

12:16.136 --> 12:17.902
The opening of the silo
is right here.

12:17.904 --> 12:19.971
- Yeah.
- I'm gonna check that out real quick.

12:22.475 --> 12:24.209
Jeffro, them cattle's moving.

12:24.211 --> 12:25.310
[bleep]

12:26.312 --> 12:27.378
Are you ready?

12:30.249 --> 12:31.583
Okay, go on.

12:34.653 --> 12:35.987
Can you see
all the way up there?

12:36.956 --> 12:38.089
[Huck] Hmm.

12:39.058 --> 12:41.459
- You hear anything?
- Nah, it's clear.

12:41.461 --> 12:43.428
I ain't seeing a damn thing
out here.

12:44.463 --> 12:46.531
[squeaking]

12:58.778 --> 13:00.245
- [thuds]
- Oh!

13:02.314 --> 13:03.448
Is that coming from the roof?

13:07.953 --> 13:08.987
Aye!

13:10.756 --> 13:12.223
I'm getting scared.

13:12.225 --> 13:13.458
[Buck] There's a big opening
up there.

13:16.929 --> 13:17.662
Hey guys...

13:17.664 --> 13:19.063
- Yo.
- Yeah.

13:19.065 --> 13:21.065
There's a big opening
at the top of this silo.

13:21.067 --> 13:23.067
Looks like it's been
busted open.

13:23.069 --> 13:24.602
-[sighs wearily] -There's
nothing out. It's empty.

13:27.907 --> 13:29.107
[thuds]

13:30.242 --> 13:31.743
What the hell's going on here?

13:31.745 --> 13:34.412
-Don't know. Something not adding up.
-[Huck] No, it's not.

13:35.915 --> 13:37.482
- [all scream]
- [shouts] What's that?

13:37.484 --> 13:39.350
- It's on the roof!
- It's on the roof.

13:39.352 --> 13:40.885
Jeffro, it's on the roof!

13:40.887 --> 13:42.053
- I'm looking, I'm looking.
- On the raft!

13:42.055 --> 13:43.254
It's on the raft!

13:43.256 --> 13:45.056
[Willy] It's right up there!

13:45.058 --> 13:46.991

Down this way!

13:52.365 --> 13:53.965
Get out, let's go!
Come on!

13:53.967 --> 13:55.433
- Look, look, look, look.

13:55.435 --> 13:57.335
[indistinct shouting]

13:57.337 --> 13:59.137
[Huck] ...Watch out!

13:59.139 --> 13:59.838
[clamoring]

13:59.840 --> 14:01.239
Be careful, now, Buck.

14:01.241 --> 14:03.641
It's over here!
He just cleared that gate!

14:03.643 --> 14:05.210
Come on. Go, go, go, go.

He's pushing.
He's pushing back.

14:08.348 --> 14:11.049
- Just see that gate here.
- Come on Bill, come on.

14:11.051 --> 14:12.984
- He's pushing them back.
- Look at 'em, look at 'em.

14:12.986 --> 14:13.985
[Huck] They're going nuts.

14:14.353 --> 14:15.720
[Bill] Daggone.

14:15.722 --> 14:17.188
Son of a bitch.

14:17.190 --> 14:19.324
- Where did it go, Buck?
- Where'd he go, Buck?

14:19.326 --> 14:21.960
He cleared that gate.
He jumped.

14:21.962 --> 14:23.628
Last step here,
he cleared that gate

14:24.063 --> 14:25.263
Wow.

14:25.265 --> 14:27.966
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
- [shouting]

14:27.968 --> 14:29.400
-Yeah!
-We got something here. Come on, come on, come on.

14:29.402 --> 14:31.236
Yeah, we gotta get over
there with them. Come on.

14:31.971 --> 14:33.171
Let's go, let's go.

14:33.173 --> 14:35.640
- Come on. Double time, boys, double time.
- Come on.

14:35.642 --> 14:37.242
- Yeah!

They're gonna wake up.

14:40.247 --> 14:42.113
-Go, let's go.
-Come on, go. Get out there.

14:42.115 --> 14:43.681
Let's move, let's move!

14:43.683 --> 14:44.816
Came down, up to here.

14:44.818 --> 14:46.351
He's gone in the grass
so he sliced out here.

14:46.353 --> 14:48.486
- Right here, I've seen that gate shake right here.
- Right here.

14:48.488 --> 14:50.255
This way, went to the bush.

14:50.257 --> 14:51.222
[Bill] Hell yeah...

14:51.224 --> 14:52.857
- Go, gotta go.
- Come on, come on.

14:52.859 --> 14:55.660
<i>[Willy] That Grafton monster,
leaped over this metal gate,</i>

14:55.662 --> 14:57.262
went right down into
the big forest.

14:57.264 --> 14:58.563
All hell, yeah

14:58.565 --> 15:01.032
Son of a bitch, he broke that
all to hell. Look at that.

15:01.034 --> 15:04.502
You could see a trail, looked like a
damn tornado went through Kansas.

15:04.504 --> 15:07.071
You can she right here where
he busted through the bush

15:07.073 --> 15:08.606
and headed right into the woods.

15:10.976 --> 15:12.010
- Hey, hey!
- Come on.

15:12.012 --> 15:13.278
[all yelling]

15:13.280 --> 15:14.812
That big bastard...

15:14.814 --> 15:17.048
That Grafton monster went
right down through here.

15:17.050 --> 15:19.284
He went right down
into that forest right there.

15:20.119 --> 15:21.185
He went back into the woods?

15:21.187 --> 15:22.654
- Yeah, right down there.
- Oh man.

15:22.656 --> 15:24.422
- You can see the trail down.
- [Bill] Hell yeah, plain as day.

15:24.424 --> 15:26.057
Daggone, I can see the trail.

15:26.059 --> 15:27.392
- Hell yeah. Wow.
- Hell yeah.

15:27.394 --> 15:29.093
You don't see him?

15:29.095 --> 15:30.795
I just caught
the tail end of him.

15:30.797 --> 15:33.031
He come running
across that barn,

15:33.033 --> 15:34.632
he jumped down on that
feed trough

15:34.634 --> 15:37.635
and he kept running. I was
trying to keep up with him,

15:37.637 --> 15:39.637
one big step and he leaped...

15:39.639 --> 15:41.406
- Oh...
- off the roof and cleared

15:41.408 --> 15:42.807
40 feet to that gate.

15:42.809 --> 15:44.876
- Yeah.
- [both] Holy [bleep]

15:44.878 --> 15:46.077
- Are you serious?
- [both] Yeah.

15:46.079 --> 15:47.278
<i>[Bill] Some damn reason,</i>

15:47.280 --> 15:50.214
a Grafton monster got
the hell off this cattle farm

15:50.216 --> 15:52.684
- like a bat outta hell.
- Let's get you guys on this side of the fence.

15:52.686 --> 15:53.952
Yeah.

15:53.954 --> 15:55.653
<i>[Bill] He wanted the hell
outta here,</i>

15:55.655 --> 15:58.222
back in that damn thick timber
to hide his ass

15:58.224 --> 15:59.490
for some reason.

16:00.759 --> 16:03.361
Down here in these woods.
That's not real far...

16:03.363 --> 16:05.229
from that tree structure
y'all found in it.

16:06.265 --> 16:07.365
- No.
- No, those rock piles?

16:07.367 --> 16:09.167
- A 100 yard.
- Maybe.

16:09.169 --> 16:10.368
Just a few hundred yards, yeah.

16:10.370 --> 16:12.270
I think right back in here,

16:12.272 --> 16:15.340
is the heart of the
Grafton monster's territory.

16:15.342 --> 16:17.842
And I think that,
that's where we need to go.

16:17.844 --> 16:19.344
- And the day...
- [thuds]

16:19.346 --> 16:21.279
- What's this?
- Hold up, hold up.

16:21.281 --> 16:23.081
- What the hell...
- Oh, daggone.

16:23.083 --> 16:24.082
Watch out.

16:25.918 --> 16:26.851
He got his new...

16:26.919 --> 16:29.187
So, what all did you fellows
find out now?

16:29.189 --> 16:31.456
Well, you dropped
a glowstick Terry.

16:31.757 --> 16:32.857
[bleep]

16:32.859 --> 16:34.425
All right, come right out
over here.

16:34.427 --> 16:36.894
- Come on down here buddy, we'll fill you in.
- Moreover...

16:36.896 --> 16:39.297
[sighs] Boy, it's been
a rough ass night.

16:39.299 --> 16:41.132
- Oh, you ain't telling us.
- Hold out, brother.

16:41.233 --> 16:42.266
Guess it has been.

16:42.401 --> 16:44.469
The good news is the
Grafton monster's no longer

16:44.471 --> 16:46.237
up here with your cows.

16:46.239 --> 16:47.939
His ass is down range.

16:47.941 --> 16:49.107
We run him the hell outta here.

16:49.109 --> 16:50.641
Well that's good.

16:50.643 --> 16:53.077
I'm awfully damn thankful you
boys come out here and help me

16:53.079 --> 16:55.813
and got this son of a bitch
down out of my property

16:55.815 --> 16:57.348
and hopefully he'll get on
down the road.

16:57.350 --> 16:58.850
All right, that's what
we do buddy.

16:58.852 --> 17:01.219
We can guarantee you he's
not eating no beef tonight.

17:01.221 --> 17:03.187
Well, talking about eating,

17:03.189 --> 17:05.456
hang on a minute boys,
I got you something.

17:05.458 --> 17:08.059
Oh my God, there ain't
more glowsticks, is there?

17:08.061 --> 17:09.327
[chuckles] Yeah...

17:09.329 --> 17:12.030
Always hard damn work
round and round up here.

17:12.032 --> 17:14.165
I'm sure you guys
like a little bit of a snack.

17:15.000 --> 17:16.501
- What?
- [bleep]

17:19.171 --> 17:25.176
[all laughing]

17:25.178 --> 17:26.944
I got you something real good.

17:26.946 --> 17:28.846
- Here you go, fellows.
- Oh.

17:28.848 --> 17:30.448
I got you some
tiny weenies here.

17:30.949 --> 17:32.150
Pigs in a blanket.

17:32.152 --> 17:35.920
[all laughing]

17:35.922 --> 17:36.988
Yes sir.

17:36.990 --> 17:38.823
- Reach in there and grab you one.
- All right.

17:38.825 --> 17:41.225
- Yeah.
- [Bill] Get in there and get one of them.

17:41.227 --> 17:43.361
This is the oddest hunt
I've ever been on.

17:43.363 --> 17:46.898
[all laughing]

17:46.900 --> 17:49.634
Terry, he's my kinda guy.

17:49.636 --> 17:52.870
<i>Brings some chow out, man,
what a hell of a dude man.</i>

17:52.872 --> 17:55.339
- Hell yeah, thanks Terry.
<i>- [Bill] Teenie-weenies.</i>

17:55.341 --> 17:56.674
<i>Hell yeah.</i>

17:56.676 --> 17:58.009
Don't get no better.

17:58.011 --> 17:59.644
Terry, you've been
awfully good to us bud.

17:59.646 --> 18:00.878
- We really appreciate it.
- Yeah.

18:00.880 --> 18:03.114
Well, you've been awful good
to me getting this damn monster

18:03.116 --> 18:04.482
down the hell out of
my property.

18:04.484 --> 18:06.017
- Thank you sir.
- Yes sir.

18:06.019 --> 18:07.685
That's the best paycheck
we've ever had.

18:07.687 --> 18:09.287
- Hell yeah.
- Hell yeah.

18:09.289 --> 18:11.823
Y'all want any more of these before
I take off and go back to house?

18:11.825 --> 18:12.890
Yeah, we're good.

18:12.892 --> 18:14.058
- [indistinct conversation]
- We thank you.

18:14.060 --> 18:15.226
For your hospitality.

18:15.228 --> 18:17.228
- Yeah.
- Y'all be careful out here tonight, now.

18:17.230 --> 18:19.063
We will. You have
a good one, Terry.

18:19.065 --> 18:20.865
Terry, he's a hell of a guy.

18:20.867 --> 18:22.166
- We'll see you brother.
- [chuckling]

18:22.168 --> 18:24.168
- [indistinct conversation]
- Take care.

18:24.170 --> 18:25.503
It's been real.

18:25.505 --> 18:27.772
[all laughing]

18:27.774 --> 18:29.107
I'm telling you right now,

18:29.109 --> 18:31.042
<i>that's some
Appalachian hospitality.</i>

18:31.044 --> 18:33.077
Don't get no better than this.

18:33.079 --> 18:36.414
Oh, I think we got the Grafton
monster out Terry's farm tonight

18:36.416 --> 18:38.316
and he left out of here
as a happy man.

18:38.318 --> 18:40.651
- Yeah.
- You're right, but

18:40.653 --> 18:42.787
I think what we need to do
is get out of here tonight,

18:42.789 --> 18:43.955
come back tomorrow

18:43.957 --> 18:45.923
and do a field investigation.

18:45.925 --> 18:47.925
I'd like to see that
tree structure you all found.

18:47.927 --> 18:48.926
<i>[Buck] Hell yeah.</i>

18:48.928 --> 18:51.062
- Sounds like a good plan.
- Are you guys ready?

18:51.064 --> 18:52.396
- Yeah.
- All right, let's get outta here.

18:52.398 --> 18:54.132
Get the hell
out of here tonight.

18:54.134 --> 18:56.134
- Man.
- Good call, buckaroo.

18:56.136 --> 18:58.336
That's some fine hospitality,
ain't it?

18:58.338 --> 19:00.771
Glowsticks and pigs
in a blanket.

19:00.773 --> 19:03.307
[all laughing]

19:06.111 --> 19:08.045
Guys, let's just go ahead
and start with the obvious.

19:08.047 --> 19:09.347
I'm a little under the weather.

19:09.349 --> 19:10.848
I'm losing my voice.

19:10.850 --> 19:12.049
- Yeah.
- So,

19:12.051 --> 19:13.384
my thought was

19:13.386 --> 19:16.587
bring the loudest man out
to help assist me.

19:17.489 --> 19:19.490
So, Bill what I need
you to do is,

19:19.492 --> 19:22.493
everything I tell these guys
translate it in your own words

19:22.728 --> 19:23.894
loudly.

19:23.896 --> 19:25.463
<i>[Bill] Brother Buck's
a little under the weather,</i>

19:25.465 --> 19:27.165
having little bit of
problem with his...

19:27.167 --> 19:28.332
- voice.
- [coughing]

19:28.334 --> 19:30.368
Well, I'm gonna step up,
help my brother out.

19:30.370 --> 19:32.703
I will be his mouthpiece.

19:32.705 --> 19:34.372
- All right, you ready?
- Yeah, heave on it.

19:34.374 --> 19:37.041
Can't help I'm a loud mouth
son of a bitch.

19:37.976 --> 19:39.610
Supercalifragilistic-
expialidocious

19:41.079 --> 19:45.116
- Say what?
- [all laughing]

19:47.286 --> 19:48.886
[coughing]

19:48.888 --> 19:50.254
Super-fala-cra...

19:50.256 --> 19:54.358
- [stammers]
- [all laughing]

19:54.360 --> 19:58.663
He can't be rolling up them
big ole $40 words like Jeffro got.

19:58.665 --> 20:00.498
I'm not gonna be able to
get them out.

20:00.500 --> 20:02.533
I'll keep waiting for subtitles.

20:02.535 --> 20:04.735
[all laughing]

20:04.737 --> 20:06.504
- Hang on, you guys ready?
- Yeah, hang on.

20:06.506 --> 20:08.973
All right. Sorry Bill.
That wasn't very nice.

20:08.975 --> 20:11.275
-No, I can't.
-You're right. I'll just go with one word.

20:11.877 --> 20:12.977
Hippopotamus

20:16.982 --> 20:19.951
[all laughing]

20:19.953 --> 20:21.786
I can feel that
clear over here Bill.

20:21.788 --> 20:24.222
[all laughing]

20:29.995 --> 20:31.562
All right guys,
let's get down to business.

20:31.797 --> 20:33.231
Last night,

20:33.398 --> 20:36.601
the Grafton monster come from Terry's
farm about 200 yards north of here.

20:37.035 --> 20:38.669
Into these woods.

20:38.671 --> 20:41.038
And just out this way just
a few paces,

20:41.040 --> 20:42.073
his home territory.

20:42.075 --> 20:43.507
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

20:43.509 --> 20:46.177
I would like to see that
tree structure you all found.

20:46.179 --> 20:48.412
I'd like to lay my eyes on
'em. And those rock piles.

20:49.948 --> 20:51.349
I haven't got to see
these things yet

20:51.351 --> 20:52.449
and I would like to
check 'em out.

20:52.451 --> 20:55.386
There's one thing here
we gotta keep in mind guys,

20:55.388 --> 20:59.890
the last time we was out here, that
son of a bitch was batted down up there

20:59.892 --> 21:01.259
watching us, stalking us.

21:01.261 --> 21:02.760
- Yeah.
- Oh yes.

21:02.762 --> 21:04.395
- And that was in the daytime too, wasn't it?
- And that was it.

21:04.397 --> 21:07.098
- Yes.
- You know, most creatures we go after are nocturnal.

21:07.100 --> 21:09.100
I don't think this thing
has a bedtime.

21:09.102 --> 21:10.401
It's got its own rules.

21:10.403 --> 21:12.236
This ain't most creatures.

21:12.238 --> 21:15.239
Now, the Grafton monster
is a legendary creature.

21:15.241 --> 21:18.042
And I think it's time
this Grafton monster

21:18.044 --> 21:20.544
met some legendary
monster hunters.

21:20.546 --> 21:23.147
- [all cheering]
- Oh yeah.

21:23.149 --> 21:24.448
[grunting]

21:24.450 --> 21:25.383
Yes sir.

21:25.385 --> 21:26.183
You ready?

21:26.185 --> 21:27.318
- Yes.
- Oh yeah.

21:27.320 --> 21:30.288
- Let's go mouthpiece.
- [all laughing]

21:34.660 --> 21:36.661
[Bill] Need to keep on
them eyeballs glued.

21:36.663 --> 21:38.362
All kinds of mayhap went here.

21:39.931 --> 21:42.667
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.
Got some movement.

21:43.402 --> 21:44.969
You've seen it too?

21:44.971 --> 21:46.937
- Yeah, I did.
- What you got?

21:46.939 --> 21:50.207
- What you got?
- Right up there, by them twin oaks.

21:50.209 --> 21:51.542
- We just seen something moving.
- [clank]

21:51.544 --> 21:52.410
[Buck] Oh listen, listen.

21:53.445 --> 21:55.146
[cracking]

21:55.781 --> 21:57.014
Hear that?

21:57.949 --> 21:59.450
That wasn't a tree knock,
but it's big.

21:59.452 --> 22:00.951
- Oh yeah...
- [rustling]

22:00.953 --> 22:02.486
- Oh...
- [all exclaiming]

22:02.488 --> 22:03.688
Damn.

22:04.656 --> 22:06.624
- Be ready guys.
- Damn.

22:06.626 --> 22:07.825
It was right there
to start with.

22:07.827 --> 22:09.994
Now it's over here. That's
moving pretty quick boys.

22:09.996 --> 22:11.862
It's headed right towards
that tree structure.

22:11.864 --> 22:14.432
- That's moving towards that tree structure Will.
- Yes sir.

22:14.434 --> 22:16.167
All right everybody,
stay ready and stay alert.

22:16.169 --> 22:17.802
We'll all start
working that way.

22:17.804 --> 22:19.203
I don't know
what the hell that was,

22:19.205 --> 22:20.938
<i>but it sounded awful big.</i>

22:20.940 --> 22:23.874
Gentlemen, I don't think
we're in the woods alone now.

22:23.876 --> 22:27.011
We need to head that way
and we gotta stay on our toes.

22:27.013 --> 22:30.448
Need to watch your ass. Damn
thing could be up in these trees.

22:30.450 --> 22:33.250
Hell yeah, like the perfect
perching post.

22:33.252 --> 22:34.585
Hell yes.

22:34.587 --> 22:37.088
Daggone look at this.
Look at this. Look, look, look.

22:37.422 --> 22:38.889
Daggone!

22:38.891 --> 22:40.825
- Look at this.
- Holy hell!

22:40.827 --> 22:41.692
- What you got?
- Look out.

22:41.694 --> 22:44.061
Look at this damn trail.
Holy [bleep].

22:44.063 --> 22:45.229
[Buck] Just get down
and look at this.

22:45.231 --> 22:47.331
[Jeff] Damn, that is a trail.

22:47.333 --> 22:49.133
That's son of a bitch's
well-used, isn't it?

22:49.135 --> 22:50.835
[chuckles softly]
You're damn straight.

22:50.837 --> 22:54.905
Look at this! Gone right across
this damn fence right here,

22:54.907 --> 22:57.174
right back through that
cattle farm. Look at this.

22:59.778 --> 23:01.979
All of sudden big Buck
looks down,

23:01.981 --> 23:04.882
<i>holy hell, looks like
a four lane runway there.</i>

23:04.884 --> 23:08.252
<i>Vegetation stomped down,
branches broke,</i>

23:08.254 --> 23:11.889
there's no doubt, something
big is using this damn game trail.

23:11.891 --> 23:14.291
That is going right towards
that cattle farm down there.

23:14.293 --> 23:15.826
- Oh hell, yes it is.
- Yes it it.

23:15.828 --> 23:17.161
[Bill] Hell yes, right up there.

23:19.164 --> 23:20.798
He's using this trail here

23:20.800 --> 23:23.234
to get right down there
in to them cattle farms.

23:23.236 --> 23:25.102
Where he's going to get him
a beef dinner.

23:25.104 --> 23:27.505
He's going to go back there
and get a smorgasbord Bill.

23:27.507 --> 23:29.240
- Hey guys, guys...
- Hell yeah.

23:29.242 --> 23:30.441
- Yeah.
- What?

23:30.443 --> 23:32.309
- Yeah.
- Is that, that tree structure?

23:32.978 --> 23:34.145
[rustling]

23:39.551 --> 23:40.985
Yeah

23:40.987 --> 23:43.220
But it's gotten
a hell of a lot bigger.

23:45.190 --> 23:46.424
Holy [bleep]

23:47.058 --> 23:48.959
Wow.

23:48.961 --> 23:50.361
Did the Grafton monster do that?

23:51.930 --> 23:53.063
Who knows?

23:57.202 --> 23:58.202
- [Buck] Guys...
- [Huck] Yeah.

23:58.204 --> 23:59.170
Is that, that tree structure?

24:02.774 --> 24:03.974
Yeah.

24:03.976 --> 24:06.110
But it's gotten
a hell of a lot bigger.

24:08.213 --> 24:09.447
Holy [bleep].

24:10.215 --> 24:12.116
Wow

24:12.118 --> 24:13.551
Did the Grafton monster do that?

24:14.719 --> 24:15.820
Who knows?

24:19.891 --> 24:22.393
Guys, let's see he's up there,
so everybody stay ready.

24:22.961 --> 24:24.995
Keep your eyes moving, guys.

24:24.997 --> 24:26.697
<i>[Buck] We need to sneak up
to that tree structure</i>

24:26.699 --> 24:28.399
<i>and take a look at this thing
up close.</i>

24:28.401 --> 24:31.502
<i>But, we need to make sure
that we're scanning the area.</i>

24:31.504 --> 24:34.138
I have a feeling
that Grafton monster's close.

24:36.875 --> 24:38.108
Daggone.

24:39.110 --> 24:41.145
[Huck] That things' massive.

24:41.147 --> 24:43.447
[Buck] I've never seen a
big foot tree structure like this.

24:44.349 --> 24:46.016
<i>[Huck] Up close,</i>

24:46.018 --> 24:49.286
this tree structure's
impressive as hell.

24:49.288 --> 24:54.124
<i>This thing keeps changing and
growing every time we come back here.</i>

24:55.126 --> 24:59.363
This Grafton monster,
it's been a busy beaver.

24:59.365 --> 25:02.633
That son of a bitch's doubles it
size since the last time we was here

25:03.335 --> 25:06.203
And none of that stuff there,
was there.

25:06.205 --> 25:08.005
- [Buck] None of the stuff going across?
- [Huck] Yes.

25:08.007 --> 25:08.639
No.

25:08.641 --> 25:09.740
No, but it was there.

25:12.143 --> 25:15.846
I've never see a tree
structure with so much detail,

25:15.848 --> 25:18.649
so many different limbs
going horizontal

25:18.651 --> 25:20.417
<i>and so many
close together vertical.</i>

25:20.419 --> 25:22.786
<i>I've never seen
anything like this.</i>

25:22.788 --> 25:24.688
I don't think
this is from a bigfoot.

25:24.690 --> 25:27.491
That means he's still
establishing this territory.

25:27.493 --> 25:30.094
Yeah. We could get in a world
of [bleep] right here in a minute.

25:30.096 --> 25:31.228
[Buck] Listen.

25:32.364 --> 25:34.899
Hear that Listen

25:34.901 --> 25:37.301
We're standing here
admiring this structure

25:37.303 --> 25:39.169
with our jaws
down to the ground...

25:39.171 --> 25:40.304
To your right, over there.

25:40.306 --> 25:43.874
like five country bumpkins
staring at the Mona Lisa.

25:43.876 --> 25:46.243
I don't think he knows
we're here.

25:46.245 --> 25:47.912
Or else he'd be
charging us right now.

25:47.914 --> 25:49.480
You know, I think
your right Buck.

25:50.849 --> 25:52.883
<i>[Huck] That has to be
the Grafton monster.</i>

25:52.885 --> 25:55.085
We damn well need to
ease outta here

25:55.087 --> 25:57.588
before he finds us
in the heart of his territory.

25:58.423 --> 26:00.257
I think, the best thing
we can do

26:01.126 --> 26:03.360
is back outta here
before he finds out.

26:03.362 --> 26:05.462
- All right.
- Good call, buckaroo.

26:06.865 --> 26:08.532
Get everyone back.

26:08.534 --> 26:11.635
<i>[Buck] We know that we have two
active hotspots with this Grafton monster,</i>

26:11.637 --> 26:14.972
that trail that we found that
leads right down to the cattle farm,

26:16.641 --> 26:19.543
and that massive tree structure
that just keeps on growing.

26:20.879 --> 26:22.846
We know where
the Grafton monster is.

26:22.848 --> 26:25.215
<i>We have to take
advantage of that.</i>

26:25.217 --> 26:28.185
<i>It's time for us to kick
this hunt in the high gear</i>

26:28.187 --> 26:29.853
and go after
the Grafton monster.

26:29.855 --> 26:31.989
It's a lot bigger than what
I thought it was gonna be.

26:31.991 --> 26:33.290
[Huck] A lot bigger than it was.

26:36.261 --> 26:38.095
[engine revving]

26:38.097 --> 26:41.298
[Bill] They got something going on
the way they're talking on the phone.

26:42.100 --> 26:43.734
Here they come.

26:43.736 --> 26:45.970
<i>[Huck] Today,
the team's going to meet up</i>

26:45.972 --> 26:48.038
and we're gonna talk about
an idea that I have.

26:49.341 --> 26:51.909
All right, gentlemen

26:51.911 --> 26:55.079
They must be up to something.
They're grinning like hell.

26:55.081 --> 26:57.815
We know the Grafton monster's
out here in these hollows.

26:57.817 --> 27:00.150
- Good seeing you, bro.
- How's it going, jarhead.

27:00.152 --> 27:02.319
<i>[Huck] We wanted to put a
[bleep] damned eyeball on it.</i>

27:02.321 --> 27:04.021
<i>We want to see
that son of a bitch.</i>

27:04.023 --> 27:05.789
- [grunts] [chuckles]
- There's my brother.

27:05.791 --> 27:08.926
I got something
these old boys are gonna like.

27:08.928 --> 27:11.595
Right, well you sons of
bitches got lined up for us today?

27:11.597 --> 27:13.397
I know it's something.

27:13.399 --> 27:17.501
Well, we know we've got two hotspots
when it comes this here Grafton monster

27:17.503 --> 27:21.271
and we want to lay eyes on
this big bastard in the worst way.

27:21.273 --> 27:22.306
- Hell yeah.
- Hell yeah.

27:22.308 --> 27:24.408
Get some peepers on him.

27:24.410 --> 27:27.511
So, I got our Trapper's
pathfinder journal.

27:31.950 --> 27:34.151
I found something
pretty interesting.

27:34.153 --> 27:35.986
Guys, wait till you hear this.

27:37.055 --> 27:38.088
Oh yes.

27:38.090 --> 27:40.257
You guys gotta bear with me
for a little bit,

27:40.259 --> 27:43.027
'cause I'm not the best reader
on the bunch, okay?

27:43.029 --> 27:44.962
I can relate to that, Huck.

27:44.964 --> 27:47.898
[all laughing]

27:47.900 --> 27:49.466
[chuckling]

27:50.368 --> 27:53.337
This page is called
camouflage is the key.

27:55.774 --> 27:57.675
Camo, yes sir.

27:57.677 --> 28:00.678
"From the great horn owl
that can sit for hours,

28:00.680 --> 28:03.347
"before it swoops down
on an unexpected mouse,

28:04.816 --> 28:08.986
"to the snow leopard that vanishes
into the snowy mountain tops

28:08.988 --> 28:11.455
"only to pounce
on a passing mountain goat,

28:12.590 --> 28:17.361
"these animals are all masters
of the art of camouflage."

28:17.363 --> 28:21.899
- Yes sir.
- "Take a page from the world's greatest hunters,

28:21.901 --> 28:26.036
"camouflage is the key
to a successful hunt.

28:26.237 --> 28:28.072
- Hell yeah.
- Hell

28:28.074 --> 28:31.208
So, keeping this
camouflage idea in my mind,

28:31.210 --> 28:32.543
I turned to brother Willy.

28:33.311 --> 28:36.046
- [chuckles]
- Oh yeah...

28:36.048 --> 28:37.981
So, what you got on your mind,
mad scientist?

28:37.983 --> 28:41.118
[all laughing]

28:41.120 --> 28:42.553
Why don't you guys
turn around there?

28:43.288 --> 28:44.154
Are you serious

28:44.156 --> 28:45.189
Oh yeah, just give us a minute.

28:45.191 --> 28:46.657
No, no, no,
turn around there, Bill.

28:46.659 --> 28:48.625
- Yeah.
- [Willy] Keep your eyes that way.

28:48.627 --> 28:53.464
It's time to show the guys what I put
together from Trapper's camo idea.

28:53.466 --> 28:57.000
- Wait till they see this...
- Let's just say I got carried away a little bit.

28:57.002 --> 28:58.836
All right, gentlemen,

28:58.838 --> 29:02.372
- [Bill] We turn around now?
- Turn around and feast your eyes on this baby.

29:04.042 --> 29:06.343
- Wow!
- [Bill] Son of a bitch, Willy!

29:07.278 --> 29:08.645
Huh!

29:08.647 --> 29:10.948
- [Willy] Recognize anything?
- [Bill] Hell yeah.

29:10.950 --> 29:13.851
That's a tree structure right
there he's been adding to.

29:13.853 --> 29:16.286
Holy smokes, look at this.

29:16.288 --> 29:19.456
<i>I bet a damn dollar old brother
Willy got "A" in arts and crafts.</i>

29:19.458 --> 29:23.060
- Look at the detail man.
- Hell yeah, just like what we seen.

29:23.062 --> 29:25.095
He knocked it out of the park!

29:25.097 --> 29:28.832
I present to you
the hillbilly ground blinds.

29:28.834 --> 29:30.234
[cheering]

29:30.236 --> 29:31.735
- [chuckles]
- Yeah.

29:31.737 --> 29:32.903
[Jeff] Awesome.

29:32.905 --> 29:36.173
- Hell yeah.
- We gotta lay eyes on this Grafton monster.

29:36.175 --> 29:39.209
These right here,
are exactly what we need.

29:39.211 --> 29:41.011
We get these ground blinds out,

29:41.013 --> 29:43.113
where we know
the Grafton monster is,

29:43.115 --> 29:44.982
it's shame on him.

29:44.984 --> 29:48.285
Here's what I'm thinking. We'll
build that first hillbilly ground blind,

29:48.653 --> 29:50.320
right here.

29:50.322 --> 29:54.792
From right here, we'll be able to
see all the way around, 360 degrees

29:54.794 --> 29:56.660
and right towards that
tree structure.

29:56.662 --> 29:58.128
- [Jeff] Sweet.
- [Willy] Yeah.

29:58.130 --> 29:59.696
- [Bill] Hell yeah.
- [Willy chuckles]

29:59.698 --> 30:01.331
That's awesome job, Willy.

30:01.333 --> 30:05.002
We put these ground blinds
up on that tree structure,

30:05.004 --> 30:10.107
and that trail, game, set,
match camouflage style.

30:10.109 --> 30:12.676
There's one more thing
that comes with camouflage,

30:15.079 --> 30:16.413
- stealth.
- Yeah.

30:16.415 --> 30:17.614
Oh yeah.

30:18.683 --> 30:20.918
You have to be quiet
when you're still.

30:20.920 --> 30:23.420
- Yes sir.
- And as we all know,

30:23.422 --> 30:26.356
we have a certain person
on this team

30:26.358 --> 30:29.259
that can't sit still
or be quiet.

30:33.164 --> 30:34.498
You're talking about
Buck, right?

30:34.933 --> 30:37.267
[chuckling]

30:37.269 --> 30:40.404
Bill is the loudest man
that I've ever heard.

30:40.406 --> 30:42.072
You can't even whisper.

30:42.074 --> 30:44.041
Hell, when you fart
it's louder than hell.

30:44.043 --> 30:46.410
[all laughing]

30:46.412 --> 30:49.446
<i>[Huck] Everything
this man does is loud.</i>

30:49.448 --> 30:50.647
He talks loud...

30:50.649 --> 30:52.216
<i>And here is a kicker.</i>

30:52.218 --> 30:55.419
<i>I already bought two pairs
of them boots [bleep].</i>

30:56.387 --> 30:57.254
he eats loud...

30:57.256 --> 30:59.223
[thudding]

30:59.225 --> 31:01.592
<i>Damn! That burrito's
froze hard as a rock.</i>

31:02.527 --> 31:04.361
<i>Ah... [grunts]</i>

31:04.929 --> 31:06.330
<i>My burrito broke.</i>

31:06.332 --> 31:08.999
hell, he even shaves loud.

31:09.001 --> 31:12.569
<i>Looking good. Doing a
crocodile Dundee style.</i>

31:12.971 --> 31:14.338
<i>Yeah.</i>

31:14.340 --> 31:17.307
The only thing we got to do
is keep Bill quiet.

31:17.309 --> 31:19.309
I got this... zzt.

31:23.147 --> 31:24.615
Maybe you ought to
give me the key

31:25.316 --> 31:26.683
- Oh!
- [all laughing]

31:26.685 --> 31:29.253
- Son of a bitch!
- [laughing continues]

31:29.255 --> 31:30.821
[laughing maniacally]

31:30.823 --> 31:33.357
On that step, get started
building these ground blinds.

31:33.359 --> 31:35.659
Time to get our camo going.

31:35.661 --> 31:38.061
Probably bruise the old
fat roller, Jeffro.

31:38.063 --> 31:42.566
[all laughing]

31:48.206 --> 31:51.341
- How you coming over Willy?
- Oh, it's looking good Bill.

31:51.343 --> 31:55.479
Me and Wild Bill, we came out early this
morning and got started on this ground blind.

31:56.414 --> 31:59.049
Think about this, on this team,

32:02.320 --> 32:04.087
<i>Damn brother Willy.</i>

32:04.089 --> 32:05.956
Hell kinda genetics you got?

32:06.257 --> 32:08.458
Monkey, cat, squirrel?

32:08.460 --> 32:10.494
Jeffro, he's the smart one.

32:10.496 --> 32:13.263
Did you know a pig's orgasm
lasts 30 minutes?

32:13.265 --> 32:15.632
[chuckles] No, hell no!

32:16.200 --> 32:18.669
Buckaroo, he's the thin one.

32:18.671 --> 32:21.772
Damn Buckaroo,
how much weight you lost man?

32:21.774 --> 32:23.307
165 pounds, Bill.

32:23.309 --> 32:25.442
I think I might've picked up
a little bit of that.

32:25.444 --> 32:26.977
- [chuckles]
- Huh?

32:26.979 --> 32:29.212
Huckleberry, he's the
handsome one.

32:29.214 --> 32:31.848
Oh Huck's looking sharp as hell.

32:31.850 --> 32:34.251
Not the old playboy look
going on.

32:34.253 --> 32:36.386
Wow, what an Adonis.

32:37.021 --> 32:39.389
[chuckling]

32:39.391 --> 32:43.226
What the hell does that make
me? Big ol' fat, loud-ass marine?

32:43.228 --> 32:45.929
Hey, I think it's time
I step my game up.

32:45.931 --> 32:50.934
- [rustling] <i>- I'm taking this
camouflage the whole new level.</i>

32:50.936 --> 32:52.369
<i>You ain't gonna be able to
see me,</i>

32:52.371 --> 32:54.671
<i>you ain't gonna be able
to hear me,</i>

32:54.673 --> 32:56.273
<i>you ain't gonna be able to
smell me.</i>

32:57.041 --> 32:58.408
<i>Bottomline,</i>

32:58.410 --> 33:01.545
welcome to Wild Bill's
camouflage.

33:01.547 --> 33:04.281
Man, this is coming together
perfect, Willy.

33:04.283 --> 33:06.016
I'm camo-d.

33:06.018 --> 33:08.251
We're right by
that damn tree structure.

33:09.020 --> 33:10.721
Back up, we're right
in the middle of the

33:10.723 --> 33:13.223
damn Grafton monster's
territory.

33:13.225 --> 33:15.392
I really have been impressed
with this Wild Bill,

33:15.394 --> 33:18.328
for once in his life,
he's actually been quiet.

33:18.330 --> 33:20.230
We get these sides finished up,

33:20.232 --> 33:21.999
we're gonna have
complete coverage.

33:22.001 --> 33:23.800
- Hell yeah. Ooh!
- [thudding]

33:23.802 --> 33:25.936
[shushes]

33:25.938 --> 33:28.238
- [whispers] What the hell is that?
- It came from over there.

33:28.240 --> 33:30.273
- [Bill] See if you can get any eyes on it Willy.
- [shushes]

33:30.275 --> 33:32.009
Might been them Grafton monster.

33:36.681 --> 33:39.082
Hey, that's Jeff.

33:40.952 --> 33:42.252
Holy [bleep]!

33:45.823 --> 33:48.992
I just walked up on this bind
that Willy and Bill are building...

33:48.994 --> 33:51.094
Man, you guys been busy.

33:51.096 --> 33:53.997
I almost walked by it
and if I can't see it,

33:53.999 --> 33:56.033
neither can the Grafton monster.

33:56.035 --> 33:58.068
I still gotta go
over that trail,

33:58.070 --> 34:00.303
and build another one
of these ground blinds.

34:00.305 --> 34:02.172
Once we get that one
over there, finished up.

34:02.174 --> 34:03.607
Hold up, hold up.

34:04.042 --> 34:05.075
Hear it?

34:05.077 --> 34:06.243
[dog barks distantly]

34:06.245 --> 34:07.477
Here that up there?

34:07.479 --> 34:09.813
- [dog barks distantly]
- Dog barking.

34:09.815 --> 34:11.815
We're standing there inside
the blind and all of a sudden,

34:11.817 --> 34:13.050
we hear a dog barking.

34:13.052 --> 34:15.152
Hold on, hold on, hold on guys.

34:15.154 --> 34:17.454
[dog barking]

34:17.456 --> 34:19.256
- [Willy] Now what?
- Damn!

34:19.258 --> 34:21.058
Listen, listen to it.

34:21.060 --> 34:23.860
- Wait, wait, wait...
- That dog's up there barking, raising hell.

34:23.862 --> 34:25.862
All of a sudden, it
ain't barking no more.

34:25.864 --> 34:28.165
-[rustling] -Something's
[bleeping] that dog up, man.

34:28.167 --> 34:29.733
This dog, it's getting messed up

34:29.735 --> 34:32.069
- Oh... we gotta...
- [bleep]

34:32.071 --> 34:34.204
- Hey, come on, come on.
- We gotta get down there, we gotta help that dog.

34:34.206 --> 34:36.139
- [grunts] Son of a bitch.
- Get down.

34:36.141 --> 34:38.208
- [grunting] - Get down
there, get right down there.

34:39.243 --> 34:41.812
[bleep] something's
really [bleeping] that dog up.

34:41.814 --> 34:43.213
[grunting]

34:44.282 --> 34:46.116
[grunts] Son of a bitch.

34:46.118 --> 34:48.285
I'm losing my camo, Willy,
hold on.

34:48.287 --> 34:51.188
We bust out that blind, take
off running into that field...

34:51.190 --> 34:53.523
- Well, listen to that.
<i>- [Willy] And you can hear that dog.</i>

34:53.525 --> 34:55.192
<i>It's yelping and howling</i>

34:57.161 --> 34:58.328
and then went quiet.

34:58.330 --> 34:59.529
Listen, listen.

35:03.901 --> 35:06.303
I hear no [bleeping] hell.

35:06.305 --> 35:09.806
Something real bad just happened
down out in that thick timber.

35:09.808 --> 35:12.342
- Yeah.
- I don't think that ended well.

35:12.344 --> 35:13.944
You can say that again.

35:13.946 --> 35:17.114
<i>[Willy] I can't tell you if that Grafton
monster's got a hold of that dog,</i>

35:17.116 --> 35:20.383
but whatever it is, messed
it up and messed it up bad.

35:24.188 --> 35:26.656
I can't tell you
what happened to that dog.

35:26.658 --> 35:29.059
But I do know,
we ain't got no lights,

35:29.061 --> 35:32.362
we ain't got no Buck, we damn
sure ain't got no Huckleberry.

35:32.364 --> 35:35.365
We need to head out of here
and fill in Buck and Huck.

35:35.500 --> 35:36.333
Follow me.

35:36.400 --> 35:38.101
Deep into the woods
of Tygart valley,

35:38.103 --> 35:40.337
sure ain't looking
good for dogs.

35:40.339 --> 35:43.006
[Bill] I can't believe I
destroyed my camera, man.

35:43.008 --> 35:44.808
That sucks.

35:44.810 --> 35:47.511
I thought man--
I spent hours on that, dude.

35:52.383 --> 35:54.084
[Buck] Yeah, this is where
they supposed to be.

35:55.086 --> 35:56.153
- Yeah, there they are.
- Oh yeah.

35:56.155 --> 35:57.220
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I see 'em.

35:57.222 --> 36:00.824
We just got a call from Jeff,
he said right at dusk,

36:00.826 --> 36:03.393
something tore into a dog
not far away from 'em.

36:03.395 --> 36:04.694
- Hey guys.
- Hey.

36:04.696 --> 36:06.362
- Hey.
- Hey, what's' going on?

36:06.364 --> 36:10.167
This is not the first time we heard dogs
getting killed here in the Tygart valley.

36:10.169 --> 36:12.469
We're just back here
working on that ground blind,

36:12.471 --> 36:14.704
and we heard this
big dog barking.

36:14.706 --> 36:16.439
It sounded like it was
fighting with something

36:16.441 --> 36:19.743
And then it let out this,
I mean, a hellacious yell.

36:19.745 --> 36:21.678
<i>[Buck] It seems like there's
something crazy going on</i>

36:21.680 --> 36:23.446
<i>in these woods
when it comes to dogs.</i>

36:23.448 --> 36:25.649
And this team, we're going to
get to the bottom of it.

36:25.651 --> 36:27.050
- Was Bill with you guys?
- Yeah.

36:27.052 --> 36:28.218
- Yeah.
- Oh yeah.

36:28.220 --> 36:30.654
- Where's he at now?
- Hey bros, back here.

36:30.656 --> 36:32.989
[Buck] Oh my gosh, Bill.

36:32.991 --> 36:37.427
[all laughing]

36:37.429 --> 36:41.097
Surprise!
Wild Bill Mr. Grafton.

36:41.099 --> 36:42.866
- Oh my gosh Bill.
- Bill

36:42.868 --> 36:45.101
- Hey, ol' Grafton?
- [chuckles]

36:45.103 --> 36:47.103
He'll never see me coming.

36:47.105 --> 36:49.839
I slip right up on
his big hairy ass.

36:49.841 --> 36:52.943
I'm gonna be standing there still, I
just kept inching up like he was here.

36:52.945 --> 36:55.078
- [cartoonish sounds]
- [all laughing]

36:55.080 --> 36:56.379
That bush has legs!

36:56.381 --> 36:57.414
- I know.
- [all chuckling]

36:57.416 --> 36:59.216
- Hey...
- [all chuckling]

36:59.218 --> 37:01.851
Why do I feel like
I'm in a cartoon right now?

37:01.853 --> 37:03.220
Why do I feel like
I'm in a cartoon?

37:03.222 --> 37:04.888
What do mean in a cartoon?

37:04.890 --> 37:07.390
[all laughing]

37:07.392 --> 37:10.527
I tell you, this camo
is top notch.

37:10.529 --> 37:12.362
You give me about
an hour in the woods...

37:12.364 --> 37:13.964
[cartoonish sounds]

37:13.966 --> 37:17.067
[all laughing]

37:17.069 --> 37:20.637
I will peckle Mr. Grafton
on his shoulder, and tell him,

37:20.639 --> 37:22.939
"Peekaboo, it's Wild Bill!"

37:23.507 --> 37:26.109
Bill, I gotta hand it to you.

37:27.812 --> 37:28.979
You look like a bush.

37:28.981 --> 37:30.847
Well, that's what I wanna
look like.

37:30.849 --> 37:32.582
Turn his light on.
He looks like bush light.

37:33.217 --> 37:35.252
- [all laughing]
- Oh wow...

37:35.254 --> 37:37.420
- [all laughing]
- Are you serious Jeffro?

37:37.422 --> 37:39.889
- [all laughing]
- Jeffro, are you serious?

37:39.891 --> 37:42.626
[all laughing]

37:42.628 --> 37:44.961
- I won't need 'em light, Jeffro.
- Oh yeah.

37:44.963 --> 37:48.331
You know what's really funny
about Bill's camouflage? [chuckles]

37:49.066 --> 37:53.970
It's poison ivy. [chuckling]

37:53.972 --> 37:56.239
All right, let's get down
to business.

37:56.241 --> 37:58.241
How long ago you guys say
this happened?

37:58.243 --> 38:00.944
It was about a half hour ago,
right before sunset.

38:00.946 --> 38:03.113
And which direction
did it come from?

38:03.115 --> 38:05.615
- Right back over there on side of that corn field.
- Over there.

38:05.617 --> 38:07.550
Well Bill, loose your outfit,

38:07.552 --> 38:09.853
let's weapon up and let's get
moving and let's head out there.

38:09.855 --> 38:14.357
As much as I would love to watch
Bill walking around like a talking bush,

38:14.359 --> 38:15.959
<i>we don't have time to play
that game all night.</i>

38:15.961 --> 38:17.593
We need to get on this.

38:22.099 --> 38:25.502
<i>[Willy] It sounded like it was about
a 100 yards down into this forest.</i>

38:27.271 --> 38:28.772
Right up through this way.

38:28.774 --> 38:32.008
Gentlemen, I think we're
investigating a homicide.

38:32.010 --> 38:34.911
We gotta head back out there
where the team heard that dog.

38:34.913 --> 38:36.913
Where it probably
met its demise.

38:36.915 --> 38:39.382
<i>But I gotta tell you,
we need to take it slow</i>

38:39.384 --> 38:42.952
and go easy, 'cause that
Grafton monster's in here

38:42.954 --> 38:44.487
and that's
a mean son of a bitch.

38:45.056 --> 38:48.158
I tell you whatever that was,

38:48.160 --> 38:51.861
by God, it sounded like
it was tearing up Jack.

38:51.863 --> 38:53.963
- Whatever the hell was down.
- Watch your ass

38:53.965 --> 38:56.099
- Hey, look right here.
- Looks like a pretty good trail.

38:56.101 --> 38:57.300
- A big one.
- Look right here, right here.

38:57.302 --> 38:58.902
What you got?

38:58.904 --> 39:01.104
- See these mayapples all busting over?
- Hell yeah, busting over.

39:01.106 --> 39:02.806
Something big's been
through here, dude. I...

39:02.808 --> 39:04.574
- Something--
- Something come through there.

39:04.576 --> 39:06.176
Hey, hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey, hey!

39:06.510 --> 39:07.877
What you got?

39:07.879 --> 39:09.045
What the hell's this?

39:09.747 --> 39:11.081
[Buck] What you got?

39:11.148 --> 39:13.283
- [Willy] Hey guys, come here and check this out.
- [Bill] What?

39:14.218 --> 39:15.785
[Willy] Is that
what I think it is?

39:15.787 --> 39:17.253
That's a canine track dude.

39:17.955 --> 39:20.056
- [Huck] Hell yeah.
- [Bill] Hell yeah.

39:20.058 --> 39:22.525
We're working towards
where we heard that sound,

39:22.527 --> 39:25.128
all of a sudden Willy
looks down and there it is,

39:25.130 --> 39:26.429
a canine print.

39:26.431 --> 39:29.132
That's definitely canine.
You see that pad?

39:29.134 --> 39:31.434
There's one, two, three,
four toes.

39:31.436 --> 39:34.104
Hell yeah, that's a canine
for sure, brother.

39:34.106 --> 39:35.271
There's no denying that.

39:35.273 --> 39:36.940
Hell no.

39:36.942 --> 39:39.743
We're not sure if this is
the same dog they heard.

39:39.745 --> 39:43.947
But what they heard would have
been the same size as this print here.

39:43.949 --> 39:45.815
Look how it's all
busting down through here.

39:45.817 --> 39:47.150
[Buck] Look at this.

39:47.152 --> 39:49.018
Everything's busted down
through here.

39:49.020 --> 39:50.920
- This is really torn up right here.
- Yeah, look at this.

39:50.922 --> 39:53.890
I mean, there's been a,
there's been a fight here.

39:53.892 --> 39:57.527
Yeah, but we're not seeing no blood
or nothing where anything got mutilated.

39:57.529 --> 40:00.296
Body, hair, no nothing,
no evidence.

40:00.298 --> 40:01.531
All right, guys.

40:01.533 --> 40:03.400
Let's start looking around.

40:04.235 --> 40:06.302
Keep in mind we need to
keep our eyes up high.

40:07.405 --> 40:10.306
If this is the Grafton monster,
where does it go to eat?

40:10.308 --> 40:12.342
Up high brother.

40:12.344 --> 40:13.676
- Keep that in mind.
- Check this.

40:15.980 --> 40:17.480
- [cracking]
- [exclaims]

40:17.482 --> 40:19.949
Get ready guys. Get ready.

40:19.951 --> 40:21.284
- [shushes]
- Hell yes.

40:21.286 --> 40:23.353
Listen, listen, listen, listen.

40:23.355 --> 40:26.022
That was right out in front
of us and that sounded big.

40:26.024 --> 40:27.056
Dude, that sucker sounded big.

40:27.058 --> 40:28.658
- Oh...
- [all exclaiming]

40:28.660 --> 40:30.827
- Where the hell?
- It's going down to there, it's going down to there.

40:30.829 --> 40:31.728
All right, calm down, calm down.

40:31.730 --> 40:33.363
Guys, there's something big
up there.

40:33.365 --> 40:36.199
We need to ease up here and take
our time but we need to go that direction.

40:36.201 --> 40:37.700
- Go slow.
- Let's roll, let's roll.

40:37.702 --> 40:39.702
[Bill] Easy does it.
Easy does it, Buck.

40:39.704 --> 40:42.972
<i>[Willy] We need to ease up that way
and see if we can't lay some eyes on him.</i>

40:42.974 --> 40:46.943
But we wanna make sure we keep
our eyes out for that Grafton monster,

40:46.945 --> 40:48.678
'cause if he grabs a hold
of one of us,

40:48.680 --> 40:49.813
you could be like
one of them cows.

40:49.815 --> 40:52.081
He could jerk your head,
clean the [bleep] off.

40:52.083 --> 40:54.551
Two canine prints
was headed right this way.

40:55.152 --> 40:56.186
Oh yeah, look right here.

40:56.188 --> 40:58.021
Oh, oh-ho-ho, look here.
Yeah, yeah...

40:58.023 --> 41:01.257
- [Bill] What you got, Will?
- We got something tipped up right here on this log.

41:01.259 --> 41:03.326
-Hey, look up through here. Look up through here.
-Yes.

41:03.328 --> 41:05.995
- Headed right this way.
- [Bill] Something walked through, tearing up jack, eh?

41:06.197 --> 41:07.363
Hey guys.

41:08.132 --> 41:09.432
We got blood.

41:09.434 --> 41:11.634
- Yo what? Blood?
- What? Blood?

41:11.636 --> 41:13.036
[Bill] Are [bleep] me?

41:13.437 --> 41:14.537
[Jeff] Oh...

41:15.940 --> 41:18.041
<i>[Willy] We're working up
this trail,</i>

41:18.043 --> 41:20.844
and I look down and
right there it is on a log,

41:20.846 --> 41:22.111
<i>a big drop of blood.</i>

41:22.113 --> 41:24.247
I don't know if that
dog made this blood spot,

41:24.249 --> 41:26.015
but something out here
is bleeding.

41:26.017 --> 41:27.917
Oh yeah, we're on the
blood trail now.

41:27.919 --> 41:30.053
Right here, look right here.

41:30.055 --> 41:32.422
- That leaf right here.
- Something has some holes in it.

41:32.424 --> 41:33.790
- [Huck] Stay on it.
- [Jeff] Right there.

41:33.792 --> 41:35.358
- Look right up there.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

41:35.360 --> 41:37.093
- Look right up there on that tree.
- [Willy] Yeah, blood all over

41:37.095 --> 41:38.895
this side of the tree.

41:38.897 --> 41:40.697
Dude, we got a steady
blood trail now.

41:40.699 --> 41:42.665
- Blood trail.
- [Bill] Going another way...

41:42.667 --> 41:45.268
-Daggone! Look at this, look.
-[Jeff] What you got? What you got?

41:45.270 --> 41:46.436
Holy hell!

41:46.438 --> 41:47.604
Oh man!

41:48.839 --> 41:50.306
- Daggone!
- Son of a bitch!

41:51.809 --> 41:53.676
That's a lot of blood boys.

41:55.079 --> 41:56.479
[Buck] Dude,
look at all this blood.
