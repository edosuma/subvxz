00:07.020 --> 00:08.729
Should I buy a new TV?

00:08.730 --> 00:10.979
Or should I buy one of
those massage chairs?

00:10.980 --> 00:13.420
Ah! Tough life.

00:13.620 --> 00:15.709
- What are you wearing?
- Mall pants.

00:15.710 --> 00:16.820
What kind of pants?

00:16.821 --> 00:17.849
Mall pants.

00:17.850 --> 00:20.340
Pants you wear at the mall--
as a sign of respect.

00:20.341 --> 00:22.100
So why aren't you wearing
a shirt?

00:22.140 --> 00:25.140
Too much respect.
It's the mall, not church.

00:25.170 --> 00:27.340
Also, I can't afford a shirt.

00:27.380 --> 00:29.780
I suppose I could buy the TV

00:29.810 --> 00:32.430
and just go somewhere
for a massage.

00:34.180 --> 00:37.280
Whoa. Uh-oh.
My mall pants!

00:37.320 --> 00:40.000
You know what?
I'm just going to buy both.

00:40.040 --> 00:41.810
[Grunts]

00:41.850 --> 00:43.950
No mall underwear, huh?

00:45.000 --> 00:51.074

01:13.420 --> 01:15.630
Keep the change.

01:15.660 --> 01:18.130
Ehh, what's up, doc?

01:18.160 --> 01:21.770
Oh, uh, just granting
people's wishes.

01:21.800 --> 01:24.040
Daffy, you can't steal coins
from the fountain.

01:24.070 --> 01:26.510
Well, then, where do you suggest
I steal them from?

01:26.540 --> 01:29.680
I suggest if you need money,
you get a job.

01:29.710 --> 01:31.880
They're hiring
at the ice cream shop.

01:40.650 --> 01:43.620
Give me a job application.

01:43.660 --> 01:45.820
Name? Address? Gender?

01:45.860 --> 01:48.290
What is this, Soviet Russia?

01:48.330 --> 01:51.630
Yeah, I don't want
to work here anyway,

01:51.660 --> 01:54.700
not in that stupid uniform.

01:54.730 --> 01:56.400
I'll take a banana split.

01:58.600 --> 02:03.240
Unh. One scoop vanilla,
one scoop chocolate, one scoop strawberry.

02:05.510 --> 02:07.780
Unh. Put the strawberry
in the middle.

02:09.820 --> 02:11.080
And now, hot fudge. Unh!

02:11.120 --> 02:13.090
Only on the vanilla
and chocolate,

02:13.120 --> 02:14.990
put regular fudge
on the strawberry.

02:15.020 --> 02:16.960
Now, some whipped cream.

02:16.990 --> 02:20.130
Hey, hey, hey!
Easy. Little more.

02:20.160 --> 02:23.330
Little more.
Little more only on the vanilla.

02:23.360 --> 02:26.230
Kind of fill in
that space right there. Stop.

02:27.870 --> 02:30.640
Now, some nuts.

02:30.670 --> 02:32.110
Unh. No nut dust.

02:37.150 --> 02:39.510
Yes green sprinkles
on the strawberry.

02:39.550 --> 02:42.720
But both no red sprinkles,
except on the vanilla,

02:42.750 --> 02:46.120
which should receive
exclusively red sprinkles.

02:47.990 --> 02:50.120
That'll be $5.85.

02:50.160 --> 02:52.460
I've only got 16 cents.

02:55.260 --> 02:57.400
Get the rest from your tip jar.

03:03.240 --> 03:05.440
Where do you get
all your money?

03:05.480 --> 03:07.640
I invented the carrot peeler.

03:07.680 --> 03:10.680
You invented the carrot peeler?

03:10.710 --> 03:13.220
Daffy, I've told you
a million times.

03:13.250 --> 03:15.550
Where do you get
all your money?

03:15.590 --> 03:18.450
I invented the carrot peeler!

03:18.490 --> 03:20.320
Where do you get
all your money?

03:20.360 --> 03:23.630
I invented the carrot peeler.

03:23.660 --> 03:26.160
Where do you get
all your money?

03:26.200 --> 03:28.330
I invented the carrot peeler.

03:28.370 --> 03:29.830
[Snare drum]
[Gunshot]

03:29.870 --> 03:31.400
So let me get this straight.

03:31.430 --> 03:33.000
You invented the carrot peeler,

03:33.040 --> 03:34.400
and now,
you have enough money to buy

03:34.440 --> 03:36.740
whatever you want
whenever you want?

03:38.510 --> 03:41.480
Inventing something is the perfect
get-rich-quick scheme.

03:41.510 --> 03:42.950
It's not a scheme.

03:42.980 --> 03:45.150
Invention is 1% inspiration

03:45.180 --> 03:47.580
and 99% perspiration.

03:47.620 --> 03:49.320
Well, I'm not big on sweating,

03:49.350 --> 03:53.460
so I'm just going to cut
to the chase on this one.

03:53.490 --> 03:55.630
[Electrical buzzing]
[Distant dog barking]

03:59.600 --> 04:01.470
How's it coming in there?

04:04.800 --> 04:06.270
I did it.

04:06.300 --> 04:08.440
I invented something
so spectacular

04:08.470 --> 04:10.440
that every man, woman,
and child will wonder

04:10.480 --> 04:12.940
how they ever survived
without it.

04:12.980 --> 04:14.510
You know when you want bread,

04:14.550 --> 04:16.209
but you don't want
the whole loaf?

04:16.250 --> 04:17.720
I call it...

04:17.750 --> 04:21.390
Daffy Duck's
equally sized bread pieces.

04:21.420 --> 04:25.360
The rest of the world
calls it sliced bread.

04:35.540 --> 04:37.170
Ok.

04:37.210 --> 04:39.370
You know after you've gone
to the bathroom,

04:39.410 --> 04:41.810
you sometimes wish
you had something to help you--

04:41.840 --> 04:43.780
you know, clean up,

04:43.810 --> 04:46.950
like a flushable paper product
of some sort?

04:48.650 --> 04:52.890
Daffy, are you telling me
that you don't use toilet paper?

04:58.030 --> 05:01.160
Mine was going to be called
butt paper!

05:03.130 --> 05:07.670
Once again, it pays to have invented
the carrot peeler.

05:13.810 --> 05:15.310
Ahem.

05:16.750 --> 05:18.480
Oh, sorry.

05:18.520 --> 05:22.290
They say
history repeats itself.

05:22.320 --> 05:24.560
Well, wouldn't it be amazing

05:24.590 --> 05:26.160
if you could visit the past

05:26.190 --> 05:29.090
and see what really happened
for yourself?

05:29.130 --> 05:32.460
Of course, to do this,
there would need to be a device,

05:32.500 --> 05:36.700
a portal in which your molecular structure
was broken down

05:36.730 --> 05:40.240
and then reassembled
in the exact same manner.

05:40.270 --> 05:42.440
You invented a time machine?

05:42.470 --> 05:44.880
No. But if there was
such a thing,

05:44.910 --> 05:46.440
and you used it a lot,

05:46.480 --> 05:48.850
you'd probably need...

05:48.880 --> 05:52.450
A big box with a handle on it
to carry your stuff.

05:52.490 --> 05:53.450
A suitcase.

05:53.490 --> 05:55.320
Everything's been invented.

06:00.990 --> 06:04.200
Inventing something is impossible.
How did you do it?

06:04.230 --> 06:06.560
Well, first, you have to be
passionate about something.

06:06.600 --> 06:07.970
Next.

06:08.000 --> 06:10.500
I happen to be passionate
about carrots.

06:10.540 --> 06:13.640
I put all my ideas
into this notebook,

06:13.670 --> 06:18.040
and one of them turned into
a little thing called the carrot peeler.

06:18.080 --> 06:20.480
Now, if you'll excuse me,

06:20.510 --> 06:23.310
I have a check to deposit.

06:23.350 --> 06:25.280
[Door opens and shuts]

06:26.790 --> 06:29.820
Let's see what else
he's got in here.

06:29.860 --> 06:33.590
[Gasps] An automatic
carrot peeler?

06:33.630 --> 06:36.930
That's the most brilliant idea
Bugs ever had.

06:36.960 --> 06:41.230
I mean, that's the most brilliant idea
I ever had.

06:41.270 --> 06:43.000
[Laughs]

06:43.040 --> 06:45.040
What's so funny?

06:45.070 --> 06:47.370
[Quiet chuckling]

06:54.000 --> 06:56.470
You know, I invented that.

06:56.500 --> 07:00.570
Ooh. I better get home.
They're delivering my massage chair.

07:00.610 --> 07:03.740
Hey! Get your automatic
carrot peeler.

07:03.780 --> 07:05.710
Excuse me, darling.

07:05.750 --> 07:08.680
May I interest you
in an automatic carrot peeler?

07:08.720 --> 07:11.380
I already have a carrot peeler.
It works great.

07:11.420 --> 07:13.590
Aha, but with my machine,

07:13.620 --> 07:15.590
you could peel carrots
at super speed,

07:15.620 --> 07:18.560
leaving more time for you
and your beautiful daughter.

07:18.590 --> 07:20.790
- He's a boy.
- Yes, of course,

07:20.830 --> 07:23.200
a strapping, masculine boy.

07:23.230 --> 07:25.700
You know, my machine peels
hundreds of carrots in mere seconds.

07:25.730 --> 07:29.300
Who wants hundreds of carrots?
I'm not a rabbit.

07:29.340 --> 07:31.510
Your son looks like a girl!

07:31.540 --> 07:33.670
Is that what I think it is?

07:33.710 --> 07:37.080
Did you steal my plans
for the automatic carrot peeler?

07:37.110 --> 07:38.650
[Chuckles]
Let me explain.

07:38.680 --> 07:40.610
I was young.
I needed the money.

07:40.650 --> 07:42.920
It's the worst recession since
the great depression.

07:42.950 --> 07:44.690
Besides, you weren't using it.

07:44.720 --> 07:47.120
That's because
it's a dumb invention.

07:47.160 --> 07:51.330
No one but me eats enough carrots
to justify the cost of this thing.

07:51.360 --> 07:53.960
[Laughs] You should have gone
with butt paper.

07:54.000 --> 07:57.430
He's right.
No one eats carrots.

07:57.470 --> 07:59.570
Everyone is eating carrots.

07:59.600 --> 08:03.700
A new study came out today touting
their extraordinary health benefits.

08:03.740 --> 08:06.910
Oh, the automatic carrot peeler is
flying off the shelves.

08:06.940 --> 08:09.740
I'm not even going to carry
the old peeler anymore.

08:09.780 --> 08:11.110
You heard it here, folks.

08:11.150 --> 08:13.510
Time to toss
that old carrot peeler

08:13.550 --> 08:15.620
and get the automatic
carrot peeler.

08:15.650 --> 08:19.520
That doesn't sound like it's going to
be good for my checking account.

08:22.830 --> 08:24.730
[Sighs]

08:28.160 --> 08:32.400
Um, do you have
any carrot peelers?

08:32.429 --> 08:34.900
As a matter of fact, I do.

08:36.799 --> 08:39.970
Ohh, no one uses those anymore.

08:40.010 --> 08:43.440
I meant
an automatic carrot peeler.

08:43.480 --> 08:45.980
How much for the massage chair?

08:46.010 --> 08:48.320
[Sighs] $100.

08:48.350 --> 08:50.380
- Is it broken?
- No.

08:50.420 --> 08:53.350
- Is it stolen?
- I just bought it.

08:53.390 --> 08:55.990
- Why are you selling it?
- Because I'm broke.

08:56.030 --> 08:58.360
Oh, that's mighty sad.

08:58.390 --> 08:59.830
I'll give you $1.00.

08:59.860 --> 09:01.430
[Sighs]

09:03.000 --> 09:05.100
Aren't you going to
take it with you?

09:05.130 --> 09:07.070
Nah. Leave it in your yard.

09:07.100 --> 09:10.440
I likes my massages
in the great outdoors.

09:15.940 --> 09:18.050
[Distant dog barking]

09:26.390 --> 09:29.390
Oh! [Laughs]

09:29.430 --> 09:31.930
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

09:31.960 --> 09:34.070
[Laughing]

09:35.430 --> 09:38.070
Hoo! Hoo! I'm rich!
I'm rich! I'm rich!

09:38.100 --> 09:40.070
- Daffy!
- I'm--

09:40.110 --> 09:42.540
oh. Uh, hey.
What's up?

09:42.580 --> 09:44.310
Can I talk to you for a second?

09:44.340 --> 09:46.250
Of course.

09:47.550 --> 09:51.120
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
Ooh! Ha ha!

09:51.150 --> 09:53.950
Daffy,
I have to sell the house.

09:53.990 --> 09:56.560
Is this because no one's buying
your carrot peeler

09:56.590 --> 09:58.590
because everyone's buying
my carrot peeler?

09:58.630 --> 10:02.000
A carrot peeler that I stole
out of your invention notebook?

10:02.030 --> 10:05.300
Because if it is, I feel like
some of this could be my fault.

10:05.330 --> 10:06.930
It is your fault.

10:06.970 --> 10:09.440
- Then let me make it up to you.
- How?

10:09.470 --> 10:11.970
- I'll buy your house.
- What?

10:12.010 --> 10:14.180
You were there for me
when I had nothing.

10:14.210 --> 10:16.550
You took me in and put a roof
over my head.

10:16.580 --> 10:18.780
I'm going to do
the same thing for you.

10:18.820 --> 10:20.920
That's what friends are for.

10:20.950 --> 10:22.290
Nothing will change.

10:22.320 --> 10:25.290
Things will remain
quid pro quo.

10:25.320 --> 10:26.960
You mean status quo.

10:26.990 --> 10:30.730
Ahem. As long as you live
under my roof,

10:30.760 --> 10:33.160
you don't tell me what I mean.

10:33.200 --> 10:35.530
I thought you said
nothing would change.

10:35.570 --> 10:38.800
Under my roof,
you'll watch your tone.

10:38.830 --> 10:40.270
I didn't have a tone.

10:40.300 --> 10:41.940
Unh! My roof.

10:47.840 --> 10:50.110
Excellent work, giuseppe.

10:52.920 --> 10:54.920
How's work
at the ice cream shop?

10:54.950 --> 10:58.150
It was fine
until some jerk came in

10:58.190 --> 11:01.460
and ordered the world's
most complicated banana split.

11:01.490 --> 11:03.230
Hey, I like what I like.

11:03.260 --> 11:06.330
Huh. Oops. Back on the ladder,
giuseppe. You missed a spot.

11:06.360 --> 11:09.900
Ah-ah-ah. Not on the chair.
It's calfskin.

11:09.930 --> 11:12.540
Uh-uh. That's ivory.

11:12.570 --> 11:14.740
Well, where am I supposed
to put it?

11:14.770 --> 11:17.610
Why don't you put it back on
and make us dinner,

11:17.640 --> 11:20.910
and try not ruining it,
like you did breakfast?

11:25.080 --> 11:28.120
I'm sorry you had to see that,
giuseppe,

11:28.150 --> 11:31.550
and you wouldn't have
if you'd have been working.

11:35.160 --> 11:36.720
[Gasps] A check!

11:36.760 --> 11:38.530
For Daffy.

11:38.560 --> 11:41.060
Son, you can't live like this.

11:41.100 --> 11:42.730
What do you mean?

11:42.770 --> 11:46.400
Guy like you wasn't meant to
wear an apron and take orders.

11:46.440 --> 11:49.970
Well, it doesn't look like
I have many options.

11:50.010 --> 11:52.710
Do I look like
I got a lot of options?

11:52.740 --> 11:55.210
I'm not smart,
I'm not good-looking,

11:55.250 --> 11:57.480
and I'm about 19 inches tall.

11:57.520 --> 11:59.680
But no one tells me what to do.

11:59.720 --> 12:02.620
I am the king of my castle.

12:04.520 --> 12:06.490
Castle's
a figure of speech, son.

12:06.530 --> 12:09.060
But if it's yours
and yours alone,

12:09.090 --> 12:11.760
it don't matter
if it's the taj mahal

12:11.800 --> 12:14.030
or a hole in the ground.

12:14.070 --> 12:18.340
A hole in the ground, huh?
What are you doing?

12:18.370 --> 12:21.710
Massage oil
for the massage chair.

12:27.480 --> 12:29.410
[Grunts]

12:32.280 --> 12:34.820
My old hole in the ground.

12:34.850 --> 12:37.390
How did I used to get
into this thing?

12:37.420 --> 12:39.790
Didn't I have a ladder
or something?

12:39.830 --> 12:41.860
Maybe it's not a long drop.

12:41.900 --> 12:44.060
[Grunts and screams]

12:44.100 --> 12:46.000
Oof!

12:52.840 --> 12:54.570
? Been thinkin' for a while ?

12:54.610 --> 12:56.340
? and there's something
I got to tell you ?

12:56.380 --> 12:57.880
Ehh, I'm kind of busy.

12:57.910 --> 13:00.350
? Been thinkin' that
our love for each other

13:00.380 --> 13:01.710
? has grown so very strong ?

13:01.750 --> 13:03.510
- Love? Wait--
- ? It's plain to see ?

13:03.550 --> 13:05.680
? we're building
our words together ?

13:05.720 --> 13:07.120
Uh, back up for a minute.

13:07.150 --> 13:09.250
? I'm lookin' in
your eyes right now ?

13:09.290 --> 13:10.620
? and I can tell
you feel the same ?

13:10.660 --> 13:12.390
You're choking me!

13:12.430 --> 13:13.960
? We are in love ?

13:13.990 --> 13:16.460
? I am so in love today ?

13:16.500 --> 13:18.100
? we are in love ?

13:18.130 --> 13:20.600
? I think I'm gonna run away ?

13:20.630 --> 13:22.600
? we are in love ?

13:22.640 --> 13:25.740
? did you tap
my phone lines? ?

13:25.770 --> 13:27.710
? we are in love ?

13:27.740 --> 13:30.210
? yes, I tapped
your phone lines ?

13:30.240 --> 13:33.050
? I won't lie,
you're a very pretty lady ?

13:33.080 --> 13:34.350
Thank you!

13:34.380 --> 13:36.350
? But you're crazy,
crazy, crazy ?

13:36.380 --> 13:39.520
? you make me want to move to Bolivia ?
I'll go with you!

13:39.550 --> 13:41.950
? You know, I'm thinking I should get
a restraining order ?

13:41.990 --> 13:43.550
Those are so hard to enforce.

13:43.590 --> 13:46.120
? 'Cause your car was parked
outside my house ?

13:46.160 --> 13:48.290
? every night this week ?
Your neighbors are sweet.

13:48.330 --> 13:51.460
? You're the reason that I have to keep
my shades drawn ?

13:51.500 --> 13:52.760
I'll watch you
through the chimney.

13:52.800 --> 13:54.970
? I've installed
an alarm system ?

13:55.000 --> 13:57.100
? with motion beam detectors ?

13:57.140 --> 14:00.040
I have the code.
? We are in love ?

14:00.070 --> 14:02.040
? give me just 5 minutes ?

14:02.070 --> 14:04.210
? we are in love ?

14:04.240 --> 14:06.480
? I think that was 5 minutes ?

14:06.510 --> 14:08.810
? we are in love ?

14:08.850 --> 14:11.250
? did you just
move in with me? ?

14:11.280 --> 14:13.450
? we are in love ?

14:13.480 --> 14:16.020
? yes, I just
moved in with you ?

14:16.050 --> 14:17.990
? we are in love ?

14:18.020 --> 14:26.130
? no, we're not ?

14:26.160 --> 14:27.770
That was our first love song!

14:27.800 --> 14:29.000
Ugh.

14:29.730 --> 14:30.770
My old rabbit hole.

14:30.800 --> 14:34.140
A little dustier
than I remember.

14:34.170 --> 14:35.810
[Coughing]

14:35.840 --> 14:38.380
Ok. A lot dustier.

14:38.410 --> 14:40.440
But at least
I'm king of my castle.

14:40.480 --> 14:41.950
This is going to be great.

14:41.980 --> 14:44.180
I don't need to sell
a million carrot peelers.

14:44.220 --> 14:47.520
I have everything
I need right here.

14:47.550 --> 14:50.590
I've got a chair,
I've got a lamp.

14:52.020 --> 14:53.620
I've got a chair and a lamp.

14:53.660 --> 14:57.290
That's all anyone needs.
I love the forest.

14:57.330 --> 14:59.600
[Thunder]

15:01.900 --> 15:04.230
Uh-oh.

15:11.280 --> 15:14.040
Sale?
Where's the expensive soups?

15:20.950 --> 15:24.320
Ooh. Mine-strone.

15:24.360 --> 15:25.920
Sounds fancy.

15:30.100 --> 15:32.700
What are you doing with those automatic
carrot peelers?

15:32.730 --> 15:34.260
Taking them off the shelves.

15:34.300 --> 15:36.500
They're all being recalled.

15:36.530 --> 15:37.870
What? Why?

15:37.900 --> 15:39.740
Apparently,
they're highly flammable

15:39.770 --> 15:42.210
and extremely dangerous.

15:42.240 --> 15:46.410
That's impossible.
I should know. I'm the inventor.

15:46.440 --> 15:47.880
You invented these things?

15:47.910 --> 15:50.350
I'm going to sue you
for everything you've got.

15:50.380 --> 15:52.650
Hey, everybody!
This jerk's responsible

15:52.680 --> 15:54.450
for the automatic
carrot peeler!

15:54.480 --> 15:56.720
- [All shouting at once]
- [Gasps]

15:56.750 --> 15:58.790
[Grunts]

15:58.820 --> 16:00.920
[Indistinct shouting continues]

16:02.860 --> 16:04.730
I hate the forest!

16:04.760 --> 16:05.860
Aah!

16:05.900 --> 16:08.930
- Bugs!
- Daffy?

16:08.970 --> 16:12.040
I know I've been a terrible friend,
but I need your help!

16:12.070 --> 16:14.470
There's a problem with
the automatic carrot peeler!

16:14.510 --> 16:17.180
Apparently,
it's highly flammable!

16:17.210 --> 16:22.010
That's impossible! Step 7 of
my design included a cooling system!

16:22.050 --> 16:25.920
Step 7?
I knew I shouldn't have stopped at step 3!

16:25.950 --> 16:27.720
I just got so sleepy!

16:27.750 --> 16:30.120
Anyway, everyone wants
their money back,

16:30.160 --> 16:31.690
but I spent all the money,

16:31.720 --> 16:33.930
and now, they're going
to take your house!

16:33.960 --> 16:35.860
You mean your house!

16:35.890 --> 16:40.300
I give it back!
Just please, come home and fix everything!

16:40.330 --> 16:43.400
I don't know.
I kind of like it here.

16:43.440 --> 16:47.810
Please!
I'm begging you, please!

16:47.840 --> 16:50.340
[Muffled grunt]

16:50.380 --> 16:52.180
I'll take that as a yes.

16:52.210 --> 16:53.580
[Gasps]

16:53.610 --> 16:55.820
[Thunder]
[Beeping]

16:56.980 --> 16:58.280
You have to do something!

16:58.320 --> 16:59.690
They're going
to level the house!

16:59.720 --> 17:01.190
I'll be right back.

17:01.220 --> 17:03.920
There isn't time!

17:05.790 --> 17:07.160
[Beeping]
[Engines rev]

17:07.190 --> 17:09.960
Take 'er down, boys.

17:10.000 --> 17:12.260
Bugs! Hurry!

17:15.000 --> 17:16.970
What is it?

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
A time machine.

17:19.040 --> 17:23.210
[Gasps]
I'll go get my suitcase!

17:23.240 --> 17:25.180
[Beeps]

17:27.050 --> 17:29.050
Wait!

17:29.080 --> 17:32.280
[Screams]

17:32.320 --> 17:34.050
No gen sprinkles
on the chocolate.

17:34.090 --> 17:36.190
Yes green sprinkles
on the strawberry.

17:36.220 --> 17:39.690
But both no red sprinkles,
except on the vanilla,

17:39.730 --> 17:42.960
which should receive
exclusively red sprinkles.

17:44.600 --> 17:46.970
That'll be $5.85.

17:47.000 --> 17:49.340
I've only got 16 cents.

17:52.140 --> 17:55.070
Get the rest from your tip jar.

17:55.110 --> 17:56.610
[Whirs and beeps]

17:56.640 --> 17:58.610
It's on me.

18:02.080 --> 18:03.880
Where do you get
all your money?

18:03.920 --> 18:05.280
Don't worry about it.

18:05.320 --> 18:06.650
Can I borrow $50?

18:06.680 --> 18:08.590
I need a new pair
of mall pants.

18:38.680 --> 18:40.780
[Clanking and whirring]

18:46.890 --> 18:49.230
[Beeping]

18:55.170 --> 18:57.900
[Rapid beeping]

19:01.170 --> 19:03.270
[Buzzes and whirs]

19:05.680 --> 19:07.010
[Electric crackling]

19:07.050 --> 19:09.110
[Whirring]

19:14.720 --> 19:16.820
[Beeping]

19:31.600 --> 19:33.470
Beep beep!

19:38.410 --> 19:40.750
[Beeps]

19:42.520 --> 19:44.620
[Whirs and clanks]

19:47.020 --> 19:49.190
[Whirring]

19:49.220 --> 19:51.520
[Clanking]

20:01.100 --> 20:03.170
[Beeping]

20:21.820 --> 20:24.020
[Indistinct grunting]

20:24.060 --> 20:26.160
[Whirring]

20:27.930 --> 20:30.030
My fellow neanderthals,

20:30.070 --> 20:32.430
I come from the future
to bring you

20:32.470 --> 20:35.270
the key to modern civilization.

20:36.570 --> 20:39.240
Butt paper!

20:50.660 --> 20:54.390
[All grunting]

20:54.430 --> 20:56.159
