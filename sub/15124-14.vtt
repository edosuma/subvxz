WEBVTT

00:01.202 --> 00:04.172
Jimmy, I think
I finally found a way

00:04.205 --> 00:06.774
to get our little flower girl
all the way down the aisle.

00:08.209 --> 00:09.410
JIMMY:
Oh, nice.

00:09.443 --> 00:11.179
Huh?
Good job.

00:13.247 --> 00:15.749
Hey, what's with
all the cameras?

00:17.118 --> 00:18.586
BURT:
I knew it! I knew it!

00:18.619 --> 00:20.488
All these years,

00:20.521 --> 00:22.390
we've been on a hidden
camera reality show.

00:22.423 --> 00:24.258
Just like that Jim Carrey movie.

00:24.292 --> 00:25.693
That's the only way to explain

00:25.726 --> 00:27.128
all the crazy things
that happen.

00:27.161 --> 00:28.396
Wait, wait, wait.

00:28.429 --> 00:30.164
If that means Jim Carrey's
just a character

00:30.198 --> 00:32.233
on our show, and none
of his movies are real,

00:32.266 --> 00:33.667
then I am going to be
very upset.

00:33.701 --> 00:35.203
That's nowhere near
what's happening.

00:35.236 --> 00:37.105
My mom says I'll
probably be getting married

00:37.138 --> 00:39.440
three or four times,
so she's not coming to this one.

00:39.473 --> 00:41.209
SABRINA:
But she still
wanted to see it,

00:41.242 --> 00:43.111
so she hired
this film crew.

00:43.144 --> 00:44.845
And get this: her mom
knows a woman from yoga

00:44.878 --> 00:46.214
whose husband
went to college

00:46.247 --> 00:47.348
with the roommate
of a guy who

00:47.381 --> 00:48.516
put the snacks out

00:48.549 --> 00:50.218
on Kevin Bacon's
last movie.

00:50.251 --> 00:52.220
And Kevin Bacon was able
to get this film crew

00:52.253 --> 00:54.622
from my mom's favorite
TV show, Modern Family.

00:54.655 --> 00:57.125
We were planning
on videotaping the wedding

00:57.158 --> 00:58.726
as our gift
to Jimmy and Sabrina.

00:58.759 --> 01:01.362
Now we only have a day
to figure out what to get 'em.

01:01.395 --> 01:02.630
Coffee mugs that say

01:02.663 --> 01:04.765
"Mr. Right" and
"Mrs. Always Right."

01:04.798 --> 01:06.267
Tie that looks
like a fish,

01:06.300 --> 01:07.801
or a fish that
looks like a tie.

01:07.835 --> 01:09.603
Hermit crabs.

01:09.637 --> 01:12.240
Ice-- you always
need ice.

01:12.273 --> 01:14.375
Uh, people sure love
those face pages.

01:14.408 --> 01:17.545
All good options,
but with such short notice,

01:17.578 --> 01:18.879
maybe we should
just give them

01:18.912 --> 01:20.248
a nice framed
picture of us.

01:20.281 --> 01:21.415
Hey, hey!

01:21.449 --> 01:22.816
* Here we go

01:22.850 --> 01:26.654
* Oh, oh, oh,
Daddy-o, oh, oh, oh *

01:26.687 --> 01:30.291
* Oh

01:30.324 --> 01:33.194
* Oh... whoo!

01:36.164 --> 01:37.398
VIRGINIA:
So, we were thinking

01:37.431 --> 01:39.300
maybe our wedding gift to you

01:39.333 --> 01:40.734
would be to pick up
your cake.

01:40.768 --> 01:43.404
We don't need you
to pick up the cake for us.

01:43.437 --> 01:44.805
I mean, you guys
already printed out

01:44.838 --> 01:45.839
those wedding
invitations.

01:45.873 --> 01:47.141
And that was enough.

01:48.476 --> 01:51.145
They got the RSVP
address wrong.

01:51.179 --> 01:54.348
Again, sorry for
the address mix-up.

01:54.382 --> 01:56.417
It is no problem.

01:56.450 --> 01:59.320
And I am sorry for your gifts.
I was not snooping.

01:59.353 --> 02:01.522
Every piece of mail
that I've gotten

02:01.555 --> 02:04.192
in the past 12 years has been
opened by the government.

02:04.225 --> 02:06.160
How many American flags
must I hang in the store

02:06.194 --> 02:08.162
before you people
leave me alone?

02:09.663 --> 02:11.765
Ah, I'm guessing
these plates are from Frank.

02:11.799 --> 02:13.601
Oh, and also,

02:13.634 --> 02:15.503
your Aunt Megan is coming,

02:15.536 --> 02:17.638
and she's requesting
a vegetarian meal.

02:17.671 --> 02:22.943
Okay, Ranjan, I can clearly see
that you've crossed out "steak"

02:22.976 --> 02:24.545
and that you wrote
"vegetarian."

02:24.578 --> 02:26.214
All right, you've got
to stop doing this.

02:26.247 --> 02:27.848
Maybe I'll eat
your beloved eagle.

02:27.881 --> 02:29.483
How would you like that?

02:29.517 --> 02:32.453
Hello. My name
is James Chance.

02:32.486 --> 02:35.656
And this is my
fiancÃ©e Sabrina...

02:35.689 --> 02:38.526
Cole... Colombo...
Colony...

02:38.559 --> 02:40.328
Collins!

02:40.361 --> 02:42.896
Yes, I'm sorry. Collins.

02:42.930 --> 02:44.532
She's changing her name
to Chance after tomorrow,

02:44.565 --> 02:46.300
so I never bothered
learning her maiden name.

02:46.334 --> 02:48.536
Anyway, we're here about
our marriage license.

02:48.569 --> 02:51.339
After Jimmy and Sabrina left
to get their wedding cake,

02:51.372 --> 02:53.507
the city clerk called
to tell us there was a problem

02:53.541 --> 02:54.742
with their marriage license.

02:54.775 --> 02:56.410
MAW MAW:
I told you she was a boy.

02:56.444 --> 02:58.346
She's not a boy, Maw Maw.

02:58.379 --> 02:59.580
So, not only
could we make up

02:59.613 --> 03:01.682
for our little
invitation snag-fu,

03:01.715 --> 03:04.252
we finally figured out
our wedding gift for them:

03:04.285 --> 03:06.254
Their marriage
license!
Hermit crabs!

03:06.287 --> 03:08.256
Their marriage
license.

03:08.289 --> 03:09.390
So, what's the problem?

03:09.423 --> 03:11.359
Did we fill something out wrong?

03:11.392 --> 03:12.726
No, your application
was rejected

03:12.760 --> 03:14.395
because, according
to our records,

03:14.428 --> 03:17.398
James here is still
married to a Lucy Carlyle.

03:17.431 --> 03:19.533
Oh, that.
No, she's dead.

03:19.567 --> 03:22.002
She got electrocuted
and hit by a bus.

03:22.035 --> 03:24.272
It was very tragic.

03:24.305 --> 03:27.508
Not really tragic;
she was a serial killer.

03:27.541 --> 03:28.709
Is there a word
that combines

03:28.742 --> 03:30.278
tragic with happiness?

03:30.311 --> 03:31.379
Schadenfreude?

03:31.412 --> 03:32.713
Now you're just
making up words.

03:32.746 --> 03:34.415
Anyway, so we're
all set, right?

03:34.448 --> 03:36.417
We still need a copy
of the death certificate.

03:36.450 --> 03:37.851
You can request one
from the coroner's office,

03:37.885 --> 03:39.720
and they'll mail it to you
in three weeks.

03:39.753 --> 03:41.422
But our wedding's
tomorrow.

03:41.455 --> 03:43.724
I don't know what to tell you.

03:43.757 --> 03:45.359
You could dig up her body
and bring it here.

03:45.393 --> 03:46.960
I'm kidding.

03:46.994 --> 03:48.462
Don't do that.

03:49.730 --> 03:51.565
The cake we ordered
was, like,

03:51.599 --> 03:53.767
five-thirds the size of this.

03:53.801 --> 03:55.436
He's not great
with fractions,

03:55.469 --> 03:58.406
but the point is, is that
this is just way too big.

03:58.439 --> 04:01.342
Your father called
and changed the order.

04:01.375 --> 04:02.543
He left you a message.

04:02.576 --> 04:03.377
(sighs)

04:06.414 --> 04:07.881
"Hey, baby, since I
can't leave rehab

04:07.915 --> 04:09.350
"to attend
your wedding,

04:09.383 --> 04:11.419
"please accept this
cake as my gift.

04:11.452 --> 04:14.422
I know how much you love
dolphins. Love, Daddy."

04:15.756 --> 04:18.025
My sister loves dolphins.
I hate them.

04:20.494 --> 04:22.330
The last thing
I was going to do

04:22.363 --> 04:23.764
was point out
that it was her father

04:23.797 --> 04:25.466
who had messed up this time,

04:25.499 --> 04:27.668
so I smiled
and suggested we just go back

04:27.701 --> 04:30.438
and get my dad's truck
to move the cake.

04:30.471 --> 04:32.306
But Sabrina had another idea.

04:36.810 --> 04:38.446
We almost made it a block.

04:38.479 --> 04:39.780
Now do you
understand

04:39.813 --> 04:41.081
why you're not
supposed to run

04:41.114 --> 04:42.583
into the street
after your ball?

04:42.616 --> 04:44.518
This is not my fault.
This is his fault.

04:44.552 --> 04:46.487
Look, nobody's
pointing any fingers.
(sighs)

04:52.893 --> 04:55.329
I know my daughter's
death certificate

04:55.363 --> 04:57.498
is in here... somewhere.

04:57.531 --> 04:59.800
How's your wife?
Other than that time

04:59.833 --> 05:01.535
you both kidnapped
Hope, I was a fan.

05:01.569 --> 05:03.371
Oh, yeah,
she's still in prison.

05:03.404 --> 05:04.872
I-I got out early
for good behavior,

05:04.905 --> 05:06.640
but Margine is doing
an extra 12 years

05:06.674 --> 05:08.342
for shanking a guard.

05:08.376 --> 05:09.477
Sorry to hear that.

05:09.510 --> 05:11.345
DALE:
Yeah, but on the upside, uh,

05:11.379 --> 05:13.347
now we know that Lucy
didn't get all that violent,

05:13.381 --> 05:14.948
murdery stuff
from my gene pool.

05:14.982 --> 05:16.484
Look, Jimmy's
wedding is tomorrow,

05:16.517 --> 05:18.552
so we really need you to find
that death certificate.

05:18.586 --> 05:20.954
He and Sabrina can't
get married without it.

05:20.988 --> 05:22.356
And they're so in love,

05:22.390 --> 05:23.657
it would break
their hearts.

05:23.691 --> 05:25.493
Probably his
more than hers.

05:25.526 --> 05:27.361
You!

05:27.395 --> 05:28.729
(screaming)

05:28.762 --> 05:30.764
(electrical buzzing)

05:32.833 --> 05:35.068
Well, that's why I couldn't
find her death certificate.

05:35.102 --> 05:38.672
Because...
Lucy isn't dead.

05:45.546 --> 05:47.548
BURT:
Are you telling me
she survived

05:47.581 --> 05:50.451
getting electrocuted
and getting hit by a bus?

05:50.484 --> 05:51.819
Yeah, she's a little fighter.

05:51.852 --> 05:53.387
Gets it from her grandfather.

05:53.421 --> 05:54.755
Nazi sympathizer.

05:54.788 --> 05:56.457
Shot eight times,

05:56.490 --> 05:58.526
still a scratch golfer
well into his 90s.

05:58.559 --> 06:00.561
That is a really
sweet story,

06:00.594 --> 06:02.062
but how the hell
did she get here?

06:02.095 --> 06:04.432
Oh, she was barely alive
when the hospital called,

06:04.465 --> 06:07.535
so I-I snuck her back
here to die in peace.

06:07.568 --> 06:08.902
And then she just
(grunts) pulled through.

06:08.936 --> 06:10.438
She woke up in her
childhood bedroom

06:10.471 --> 06:13.441
and thought she was
eight years old again.

06:13.474 --> 06:14.742
Taking a bus to the skull

06:14.775 --> 06:16.544
scrambles up
the old noggin a bit.

06:16.577 --> 06:17.310
If she thinks
she's eight,

06:17.344 --> 06:19.179
why'd she just
try to kill us?

06:19.212 --> 06:21.415
Well, seeing you guys
must have triggered something

06:21.449 --> 06:23.116
in her brain,
but as you witnessed,

06:23.150 --> 06:25.919
I superglued
a very powerful shock collar

06:25.953 --> 06:27.688
to her neck.

06:27.721 --> 06:29.523
I got it from a patient
of mine who's a masochist.

06:29.557 --> 06:30.791
I had to threaten
not to kick his ass

06:30.824 --> 06:32.192
in order to get it.

06:32.225 --> 06:33.861
This is crazy.
I'm calling the police.

06:33.894 --> 06:35.563
No, no, no, no. No, no.

06:35.596 --> 06:37.965
Look, if she goes
back into the system,

06:37.998 --> 06:39.800
she'll just be out again
in a year or two, and...

06:39.833 --> 06:42.570
something out there
will trigger her.

06:42.603 --> 06:44.472
Everyone is safer
if she's here.

06:44.505 --> 06:45.606
With me.

06:45.639 --> 06:47.475
I know the rest of the world

06:47.508 --> 06:49.443
just sees her
as a serial killer,

06:49.477 --> 06:51.645
but to me,
she's still that little girl

06:51.679 --> 06:55.783
who used to call a suitcase a...
a coo-sace.

06:55.816 --> 06:57.451
Jimmy still says
"pasketti,"

06:57.485 --> 06:59.487
so I totally got where
Dale was coming from.

06:59.520 --> 07:01.822
It's crazy.
I wanted to turn her in.

07:01.855 --> 07:04.124
But then she probably wouldn't
sign the divorce papers,

07:04.157 --> 07:05.793
and the wedding
would be delayed.

07:05.826 --> 07:07.461
So, we made a deal.

07:07.495 --> 07:09.930
I picked up
a few skills in prison:

07:09.963 --> 07:11.732
fighting off rapists
with sharp toenails,

07:11.765 --> 07:13.601
making an excellent
toilet merlot.

07:13.634 --> 07:16.504
Spent a lot of time
in the computer lab

07:16.537 --> 07:19.507
where I got very good
at graphic design.

07:19.540 --> 07:22.610
So I forged
a death certificate, yeah.

07:22.643 --> 07:24.612
Best wedding gift ever.

07:24.645 --> 07:27.114
And it came with
a free bottle of wine.

07:27.147 --> 07:28.816
Now we'll go get
the wedding license,

07:28.849 --> 07:30.150
and they can
wake up tomorrow

07:30.183 --> 07:32.520
and just enjoy
their wedding day.

07:32.553 --> 07:35.523
I went online to see how
you guys should wear these.

07:35.556 --> 07:38.592
And apparently,
it's called a cummerbund,

07:38.626 --> 07:40.494
not a cumberbun.

07:40.528 --> 07:41.995
Makes me wonder if
there are other words

07:42.029 --> 07:43.497
I've been saying wrong.

07:43.531 --> 07:45.265
James and Sabrina are
having their reception

07:45.298 --> 07:46.634
in a gymnasium

07:46.667 --> 07:48.135
because they're on
a tight budget.

07:48.168 --> 07:49.803
So, to help out,
I offered to cater.

07:49.837 --> 07:52.873
And to dust off my old
DJ turntables from the '80s.

07:52.906 --> 07:55.576
*

07:55.609 --> 07:57.511
(tap dancing)

08:00.581 --> 08:02.282
Ladies!

08:02.315 --> 08:05.052
Tap aerobics was supposed
to be over at 11:30.

08:05.085 --> 08:06.654
It's now 11:31.

08:06.687 --> 08:09.222
Any fat you haven't
tapped off by now

08:09.256 --> 08:10.924
can wait until tomorrow.

08:13.894 --> 08:17.565
Programs. Get your programs.

08:17.598 --> 08:19.567
It's the only way to know
how much more

08:19.600 --> 08:21.201
you've got to sit through.

08:21.234 --> 08:22.870
Reverend Bob,

08:22.903 --> 08:24.538
we got Jimmy and Sabrina's
marriage license.

08:24.572 --> 08:25.873
Marvelous.
I've been waiting...

08:25.906 --> 08:27.174
Wha-wha...?

08:27.207 --> 08:28.809
You?

08:28.842 --> 08:30.911
Barbara June Thompson?

08:30.944 --> 08:33.581
I thought you died 50 years ago.

08:33.614 --> 08:37.017
Oh, yeah, I remember him.
(laughs)

08:37.050 --> 08:39.720
Oh, I used to fake
my death all the time.

08:39.753 --> 08:41.989
Mostly to get out of stuff.
(chuckles)

08:42.022 --> 08:44.925
Oh, especially when I was
giving voice lessons

08:44.958 --> 08:46.994
to little, chubby,
talentless brats

08:47.027 --> 08:48.829
who sang like a seal.

08:48.862 --> 08:51.231
The animal,
not the Grammy winner

08:51.264 --> 08:53.033
with the messed-up face.

08:53.066 --> 08:55.736
Anyway, uh,
faking a heart attack

08:55.769 --> 08:58.271
was a lot less traumatic
than telling them

08:58.305 --> 09:00.708
(laughing):
how terrible they were.

09:00.741 --> 09:02.710
Because of you,
I gave up my dream

09:02.743 --> 09:04.745
of becoming
the next Frankie Valli.

09:04.778 --> 09:07.280
You're an evil woman,
Barbara June Thompson.

09:07.314 --> 09:09.717
And I refuse
to marry anyone

09:09.750 --> 09:11.284
who is related to you.

09:11.318 --> 09:13.687
What? No...

09:13.721 --> 09:15.756
No, no, no, ma'am.

09:15.789 --> 09:17.257
Oh, no.

09:17.290 --> 09:19.693
Jimmy and Sabrina cannot
find out about any of this.

09:19.727 --> 09:22.062
I'll stay here with Maw Maw
and work on Reverend Bob.

09:22.095 --> 09:23.631
Burt, go stall 'em.

09:23.664 --> 09:25.733
By the way, Maw Maw,

09:25.766 --> 09:27.200
now I know you faked
that heart attack

09:27.234 --> 09:29.102
when you were trying
to teach me Spanish.

09:32.740 --> 09:33.974
Apology accepted.

09:37.077 --> 09:38.979
What's with the sword?

09:39.012 --> 09:44.752
I take my job as backup
best man very seriously.

09:44.785 --> 09:46.386
The truth is,

09:46.419 --> 09:49.122
my high school wouldn't let me
bring this sword to prom.

09:49.156 --> 09:52.159
Now I finally get
a chance to use it.

09:55.128 --> 09:57.765
Small problem.

09:57.798 --> 09:58.799
Why is he going up there?

09:58.832 --> 09:59.800
Is it starting?

09:59.833 --> 10:01.001
I don't know.

10:01.034 --> 10:02.770
We were too cheap to
pay for a rehearsal.

10:02.803 --> 10:04.672
Just go, go.
Okay.

10:04.705 --> 10:07.274
Reverend Bob's running late,
so just hang tight.

10:07.307 --> 10:08.809
SABRINA:
Hey!

10:08.842 --> 10:10.844
What's happening?

10:10.878 --> 10:13.346
(whispering loudly):
Reverend Bob is running late.

10:13.380 --> 10:15.348
(sighs)

10:15.382 --> 10:16.817
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

10:16.850 --> 10:18.351
Sit down, sit down.
This isn't it.

10:18.385 --> 10:20.788
This is not it.
Sit down, sit down.

10:20.821 --> 10:22.956
Reverend Bob
is stuck in traffic.

10:22.990 --> 10:25.826
He was, uh, exercising
across town.

10:25.859 --> 10:27.360
With weights or demons?

10:27.394 --> 10:28.696
I didn't ask. Point is,

10:28.729 --> 10:30.330
it's going to be a while.
Oh, man.

10:30.363 --> 10:32.132
Well, what are we
going to do?

10:32.165 --> 10:34.702
We have all these
people here, and I just...

10:34.735 --> 10:36.003
I don't want to be rude.

10:36.036 --> 10:38.105
What part of "sit down"
do you not understand?

10:38.138 --> 10:39.840
Sit!

10:41.474 --> 10:43.711
I think I know how we
can kill some time

10:43.744 --> 10:44.845
till Reverend Bob
shows up.

10:44.878 --> 10:47.180
Reception before the ceremony.

10:47.214 --> 10:49.182
Jimmy's a big fan
of doing things out of order.

10:49.216 --> 10:50.818
Just ask Hope.

10:50.851 --> 10:54.221
*

10:58.025 --> 11:00.327
Mind if I take her
for one last spin?

11:09.269 --> 11:11.004
Dale?

11:12.873 --> 11:14.074
Taquito?

11:14.107 --> 11:15.709
What are you doing here?

11:15.743 --> 11:17.878
This disguise seemed
like a much better idea

11:17.911 --> 11:19.412
when I thought
there'd be other servers here.

11:19.446 --> 11:20.781
What's going on?

11:20.814 --> 11:21.882
(sighs)
Uh, bit of a problem.

11:21.915 --> 11:23.383
Uh, Lucy escaped.

11:23.416 --> 11:25.185
You haven't seen
her, have you?

11:25.218 --> 11:27.755
No. I thought you said
you had her under control.

11:27.788 --> 11:31.224
I did, uh, but her brain
got triggered again.

11:32.893 --> 11:34.762
The Natesville Cake-tastrophe

11:34.795 --> 11:37.497
has taken an ugly,
environmental turn.

11:37.530 --> 11:41.434
We have now confirmed that there
are five icing-covered pigeons

11:41.468 --> 11:44.237
being treated
at local animal hospitals.

11:44.271 --> 11:46.206
And animal experts
are preparing

11:46.239 --> 11:49.276
for an outbreak
of raccoon diabetes.

11:49.309 --> 11:51.244
But in more joyful news,

11:51.278 --> 11:53.380
the happy couple
who caused this mess,

11:53.413 --> 11:55.883
James Chance
and Sabrina Collins,

11:55.916 --> 11:57.818
walked away from the accident

11:57.851 --> 11:59.419
and will walk down the aisle

11:59.452 --> 12:02.890
this afternoon at the
United Church of Natesville.

12:02.923 --> 12:04.457
No!

12:04.491 --> 12:07.527
(grunting)

12:07.560 --> 12:08.896
I'm calling the police.

12:08.929 --> 12:09.863
No, no, no.
No, Burt, don't.

12:09.897 --> 12:11.398
What if this was Hope?

12:13.266 --> 12:14.968
DALE:
I mean, she is
Lucy's daughter.

12:15.002 --> 12:16.770
That makes her
half serial killer.

12:16.804 --> 12:18.738
(chuckling):
That'll never happen.

12:22.475 --> 12:23.944
BURT:
Fine.

12:23.977 --> 12:25.946
But Virginia can never
find out about this.

12:25.979 --> 12:30.083
I remember when Lucy tore
apart her first stray cat.

12:30.117 --> 12:32.152
They grow up so fast.

12:32.185 --> 12:34.822
Wow.

12:34.855 --> 12:36.556
I wasn't paying attention.

12:36.589 --> 12:40.427
Wow, Dan,
that was amazing.

12:40.460 --> 12:42.295
If you know any
single homeless ladies,

12:42.329 --> 12:43.964
I'm on the market.

12:43.997 --> 12:44.965
Literally.

12:44.998 --> 12:46.433
I live on top of the market.

12:50.303 --> 12:52.272
*

12:54.908 --> 12:56.509
Lucy's either hiding
or in disguise.

12:56.543 --> 12:57.811
We're gonna have to
check everyone here.

12:57.845 --> 12:59.279
You're right.

12:59.312 --> 13:00.814
(quietly):
What are you doing?

13:00.848 --> 13:02.950
Oh. She's that good.

13:05.953 --> 13:07.187
Ooh. Stop.

13:07.220 --> 13:09.122
(giggling):
Okay, okay, okay. Okay.

13:14.862 --> 13:16.930
Would you care to dance?

13:16.964 --> 13:18.031
Mm-mm.

13:20.033 --> 13:21.935
Would you care to dance?

13:21.969 --> 13:23.370
Hm-mm.

13:27.074 --> 13:29.609
Would you care to dance?

13:29.642 --> 13:30.978
Fine.

13:36.649 --> 13:37.951
Go ahead.

13:37.985 --> 13:39.552
I just want to watch.

13:39.586 --> 13:41.188
Will you please come out

13:41.221 --> 13:44.091
and talk to us, Reverend Bob?

13:45.893 --> 13:46.994
Please don't go.

13:47.027 --> 13:48.862
I'm sure we can
work this out.

13:48.896 --> 13:51.398
I thought I killed
that woman with my voice.

13:51.431 --> 13:53.333
I didn't speak for five years.

13:53.366 --> 13:55.502
I had to learn sign language.

14:01.341 --> 14:03.476
You don't even want to know

14:03.510 --> 14:04.978
what I just called you.

14:05.012 --> 14:07.047
All this whining
brings back memories

14:07.080 --> 14:08.481
of his awful high notes.

14:08.515 --> 14:10.483
Look, she's crazy, okay?

14:10.517 --> 14:12.019
You don't even
want to know

14:12.052 --> 14:13.486
what she told me
I could never do.

14:13.520 --> 14:15.923
She said I could
never be a-a doctor,

14:15.956 --> 14:17.324
or a lawyer,

14:17.357 --> 14:19.927
or a Laker Girl like
Paula Abdul Jabbar.

14:19.960 --> 14:22.362
Did you ever become
any of those things?
No.

14:22.395 --> 14:24.531
I'm a maid because
I listened to her.

14:24.564 --> 14:27.234
And also 'cause I
got pregnant at 15

14:27.267 --> 14:29.536
and dropped out
of high school.

14:29.569 --> 14:31.104
And I'm a little lazy.

14:31.138 --> 14:33.974
But the point is, you
can't let anyone but you

14:34.007 --> 14:35.542
destroy your dreams.

14:35.575 --> 14:39.612
Well, I've always wanted to...

14:39.646 --> 14:44.451
(off-key):
* Croon again.

14:44.484 --> 14:46.086
VIRGINIA:
Wow.

14:46.119 --> 14:49.056
You have a
wonderful voice.

14:49.089 --> 14:50.623
Really? Do you think so?

14:50.657 --> 14:51.691
Definitely.

14:51.724 --> 14:54.461
You're better than a lot
of professional singers.

14:54.494 --> 14:56.997
Linda McCartney
and, uh, um,

14:57.030 --> 14:59.232
Captain Kirk
come to mind.

14:59.266 --> 15:00.400
Great news.

15:00.433 --> 15:02.402
Reverend Bob
just arrived.

15:02.435 --> 15:04.104
(gasps)
Thank God.

15:04.137 --> 15:06.106
Ugh, now we can finally
get this wedding

15:06.139 --> 15:08.575
back on track and do things
the way we planned.

15:08.608 --> 15:10.443
Well, not exactly.

15:10.477 --> 15:12.112
You won't be walking
down the aisle

15:12.145 --> 15:13.947
to "Here Comes the Bride."

15:13.981 --> 15:15.548
BURT: I knew Virginia
would be mad

15:15.582 --> 15:17.050
if she found out
I was hiding the fact

15:17.084 --> 15:18.952
that Lucy had escaped,
so I decided

15:18.986 --> 15:20.720
not to tell her,
which meant it was up to me

15:20.753 --> 15:25.458
to keep this white wedding
from becoming a red wedding.

15:25.492 --> 15:27.961
Did that sound cool?

15:27.995 --> 15:30.097
It seemed cool.

15:30.130 --> 15:32.499
(classical music playing)

15:40.173 --> 15:42.242
I can't do this.

15:42.275 --> 15:44.644
I ate too many taquitos
at the reception.

15:44.677 --> 15:46.980
There's no way I'm gonna
make it through the ceremony

15:47.014 --> 15:48.748
without having to go
to the bathroom.

15:48.781 --> 15:51.118
You're gonna have to take
my place as best man.

15:51.151 --> 15:53.120
Here.

15:53.153 --> 15:55.989
I ate a lot of taquitos, too.

15:56.023 --> 16:00.027
But a good backup best man
always comes prepared.

16:03.096 --> 16:04.297
(classical music playing)

16:08.235 --> 16:09.702
All right.

16:11.504 --> 16:13.273
I'm so happy
for you, Sabrina,

16:13.306 --> 16:15.708
but unfortunately
my stomach is not.

16:15.742 --> 16:17.510
Are you sure you're okay?
(grunts)

16:17.544 --> 16:19.279
I'm fine. I'll just
watch from back here.

16:19.312 --> 16:21.181
Be closer to
the facilities.

16:21.214 --> 16:22.349
All right.

16:22.382 --> 16:24.251
Let's do this.

16:27.054 --> 16:29.189
(off-key):
* Big girls

16:29.222 --> 16:31.024
* Don't cry

16:31.058 --> 16:33.026
Are you kidding me?
* Big girls

16:33.060 --> 16:35.395
The faster we walk,
the sooner he stops.
* Don't cry

16:35.428 --> 16:37.364
* Big girls

16:37.397 --> 16:39.299
* Don't cry-y-y...

16:39.332 --> 16:40.533
(whispers):
Burt.

16:40.567 --> 16:43.070
Sorry.

16:43.103 --> 16:45.072
Look at that, Dale.

16:45.105 --> 16:47.207
Be seated.
One day,
you're taking them

16:47.240 --> 16:49.209
for pony rides and going
trick-or-treating.

16:49.242 --> 16:51.111
Next thing you know,
she's responsible

16:51.144 --> 16:52.712
for seven homicides
that we know of

16:52.745 --> 16:56.349
and wearing a shock collar
designed for livestock.

16:56.383 --> 16:58.218
Where does the time go?

16:58.251 --> 17:00.553
Hey... if she's still
wearing that collar,

17:00.587 --> 17:02.222
maybe we should
hit the button.

17:02.255 --> 17:05.225
Maybe we'll hear
her scream.

17:05.258 --> 17:07.727
(beeps, electricity cackling)

17:07.760 --> 17:09.429
Huh. Nothing.

17:09.462 --> 17:11.431
Coast is clear.
Yeah.

17:16.303 --> 17:18.538
Love isn't just an emotion.

17:18.571 --> 17:22.442
It's a taste, touch, smell.

17:22.475 --> 17:25.545
"What does love smell like?"
you might ask.

17:25.578 --> 17:29.349
To me, it smells
like the burning propane

17:29.382 --> 17:31.351
from a hot air balloon

17:31.384 --> 17:33.520
as you're floating
through the sky

17:33.553 --> 17:38.091
on a crisp autumn morning
with your best friend Steve.

17:38.125 --> 17:39.459
REVEREND BOB:
What does love
taste like?

17:39.492 --> 17:40.793
Well, to me...

17:40.827 --> 17:42.862
You've got the shock power
set at one?

17:42.895 --> 17:45.132
Oh, yeah, I-I couldn't stand
to set it any higher.

17:45.165 --> 17:46.699
She... she's my little girl.
(chuckles)

17:46.733 --> 17:49.236
She's not my little girl.

17:49.269 --> 17:52.372
(beeps, electricity crackles)

17:52.405 --> 17:53.306
Oh, there you are, sweetie.

17:53.340 --> 17:55.342
(grunting)

17:57.277 --> 17:58.411
Oh!

17:58.445 --> 17:59.712
JIMMY:
Weddings aren't just

17:59.746 --> 18:01.614
about the bride and groom.

18:01.648 --> 18:04.151
They also bring
families together.

18:04.184 --> 18:06.253
(Lucy grunts)

18:06.286 --> 18:08.721
(sobs)

18:08.755 --> 18:12.792
The rings, please.

18:12.825 --> 18:15.228
And while something
unexpected usually happens,

18:15.262 --> 18:17.264
that's what makes them
interesting.

18:23.870 --> 18:25.605
(grunts)
(gasps)

18:25.638 --> 18:27.674
(grunts loudly)

18:27.707 --> 18:29.309
(beeps, electricity cackles))

18:29.342 --> 18:31.144
But in the end,
all that matters

18:31.178 --> 18:32.812
is those two important words.

18:32.845 --> 18:34.447
Help me.

18:34.481 --> 18:35.815
I do.

18:35.848 --> 18:37.284
(grunts)

18:37.317 --> 18:38.451
There's no TV to hit me

18:38.485 --> 18:39.652
over the head with this time.

18:39.686 --> 18:41.120
(grunts)

18:42.555 --> 18:44.924
This is God's TV.

18:44.957 --> 18:47.227
Sorry, baby.

18:47.260 --> 18:49.329
I do.

18:49.362 --> 18:53.200
You may now kiss
your lovely bride.

19:03.976 --> 19:05.178
(sighs)

19:27.267 --> 19:28.901
We had a few
minor issues,

19:28.935 --> 19:30.670
(chuckles)
like the cake disaster,

19:30.703 --> 19:32.739
but for the most part,

19:32.772 --> 19:34.741
everything went off
without a hitch.

19:34.774 --> 19:36.676
And our gift to them was

19:36.709 --> 19:38.211
we let them believe
that nonsense.

19:38.245 --> 19:40.980
They never found out about
the marriage license fiasco

19:41.013 --> 19:43.283
or Reverend Bob
refusing to do the wedding.

19:43.316 --> 19:45.552
Yup, we took care
of everything.
Mm-hmm.

19:45.585 --> 19:47.887
Even put our lives on the
line to save the day.

19:47.920 --> 19:50.357
That might be taking it
a little far.

19:50.390 --> 19:52.859
(chuckles)

19:52.892 --> 19:54.327
DALE:
As you can see,

19:54.361 --> 19:56.363
Lucy's returned
to her childlike state.

19:56.396 --> 19:57.864
She doesn't even
remember the wedding.

19:57.897 --> 20:00.233
Just keep her away from us
from now on, okay?

20:00.267 --> 20:01.934
I mean, no offense,
but we're kind of done

20:01.968 --> 20:04.271
with the whole Lucy coming back
from the dead thing.

20:04.304 --> 20:06.339
It's like every year
we think she's gone,

20:06.373 --> 20:08.541
and then she comes back
in some crazy way.

20:08.575 --> 20:11.378
Messes up our lives again.
It's getting old.

20:11.411 --> 20:13.380
I promise, we'll be out
of your lives, uh, forever.

20:13.413 --> 20:15.415
But you do realize we've been
being filmed the entire time,

20:15.448 --> 20:17.950
so Jimmy and Sabrina are
gonna see their wedding video

20:17.984 --> 20:19.686
and know that, uh,
Lucy's alive.

20:19.719 --> 20:22.389
Oh, man, you're right.

20:22.422 --> 20:23.390
How we gonna fix this?

20:23.423 --> 20:24.424
I don't know.

20:24.457 --> 20:26.826
*

20:28.461 --> 20:31.364
(grunting):
Hear me now? Hear me now?

20:33.433 --> 20:34.534
All right, Mom.

20:34.567 --> 20:36.469
That's it.
(sighs)

20:36.503 --> 20:38.971
Thank you so much
for this incredible gift.

20:39.005 --> 20:40.773
We're gonna cherish it forever.

20:40.807 --> 20:43.276
I'm sure we're gonna watch it
a million times.

20:43.310 --> 20:46.379
And, um, when we do,

20:46.413 --> 20:50.317
I want Jimmy
to hear this last part.

20:50.350 --> 20:54.954
Jimmy, you always make it
seem like you're lucky

20:54.987 --> 20:57.724
to have me as your wife, but...

20:57.757 --> 21:00.360
I'm the lucky one.

21:00.393 --> 21:02.595
I'm lucky to have you and Hope

21:02.629 --> 21:05.498
and your entire family
in my life, and...

21:05.532 --> 21:08.468
sometimes I feel like
I don't say that to you enough,

21:08.501 --> 21:10.303
but it's true.

21:10.337 --> 21:13.906
And when we watch this
with our grandkids one day,

21:13.940 --> 21:18.411
I want them to know
how much you mean to me.

21:18.445 --> 21:20.413
I love you.

21:34.026 --> 21:37.063
Celebrity voices
were impersonated.
