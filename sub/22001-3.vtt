WEBVTT

00:01.169 --> 00:03.037
She's coming in hot.
She's The Mick.

00:03.071 --> 00:05.173
-Yaah!
-I just built that.

00:05.206 --> 00:06.407
It didn't take.

00:06.440 --> 00:08.476
Catch all-new episodes Tuesdays.

00:08.509 --> 00:10.511
And check out our other Fox
programs-- Brooklyn Nine-Nine,

00:10.544 --> 00:12.380
The Last Man on Earth and
Ghosted.

00:12.413 --> 00:14.548
I don't really know how
to do any of this stuff.

00:14.582 --> 00:15.749
Only on Fox.

00:18.619 --> 00:20.054
-(birds chirping)
-(footsteps approaching)

00:24.192 --> 00:26.060
-There we go. That's a
good-looking apple, huh? -Yeah.

00:26.094 --> 00:28.996
-Oh, yeah. -Isn't this fun,
you guys? -Smells like crap.

00:29.029 --> 00:30.931
-I'm covered in ants.
-It's bright as hell out here.

00:30.964 --> 00:32.333
Look, I just thought
it would be nice to get out

00:32.366 --> 00:33.734
of that depressing house
for a little while

00:33.767 --> 00:35.103
and have a nice picnic.

00:35.136 --> 00:36.104
"Picnic" implies food.

00:36.137 --> 00:37.438
You brought nothing.

00:37.471 --> 00:39.207
Oh, yeah?
What did you bring, Sabrina?

00:39.240 --> 00:41.409
Besides that crappy attitude
of yours.

00:41.442 --> 00:42.910
Okay, why can't we just go
to a restaurant?

00:42.943 --> 00:44.678
Because restaurants cost money,
genius,

00:44.712 --> 00:46.347
and we don't have any.
Look around you,

00:46.380 --> 00:47.348
there's miles of free snacks.

00:47.381 --> 00:49.083
I'm eating the ants.

00:49.117 --> 00:51.185
I like how they wiggle
inside me.

00:51.219 --> 00:52.720
See? This guy's making it work.

00:52.753 --> 00:53.954
I am not foraging for food.

00:53.987 --> 00:55.223
I'm not a frickin' animal.

00:55.256 --> 00:57.225
I like it.
Reminds me of Guatemala.

00:57.258 --> 00:59.393
-(chuckles)
-My point exactly.

00:59.427 --> 01:01.529
All right, if you guys
can't enjoy this beautiful day,

01:01.562 --> 01:04.031
then there is something
seriously wrong with you.

01:04.064 --> 01:05.032
Beer me.

01:05.065 --> 01:06.033
No beer.

01:06.066 --> 01:07.435
What?! What do you mean?

01:07.468 --> 01:09.137
I thought there'd be a beer guy.

01:09.170 --> 01:10.804
Why would there be a beer guy?

01:10.838 --> 01:12.906
It's not a baseball stadium--
it's an orchard.

01:12.940 --> 01:14.908
All right, well,
at least a hard cider guy.

01:14.942 --> 01:15.976
So we're just supposed
to sit around,

01:16.009 --> 01:17.811
like a-a bunch of sober turds?

01:17.845 --> 01:19.647
-(phone ringing)
-This sucks. You suck.

01:19.680 --> 01:21.282
Unbelievable.

01:21.315 --> 01:23.951
Ugh.
Milldale Correctional again?

01:23.984 --> 01:25.619
Do you believe the balls
on this woman?

01:25.653 --> 01:28.556
-I mean, she walked out on us.
-(phone beeps off)

01:28.589 --> 01:31.058
-Nice. Make her sweat.
-Hey, at least she's trying.

01:31.091 --> 01:32.893
Dad hasn't even attempted
to reach out.

01:32.926 --> 01:35.296
It's like he prefers prison
to his own family.

01:35.329 --> 01:36.764
What's prison like?

01:36.797 --> 01:38.399
Oh, it's...

01:38.432 --> 01:40.000
it's kind of like camp.

01:40.033 --> 01:43.671
Right? You got your bunk beds,
games, arts and crafts.

01:43.704 --> 01:45.906
-I want to go to prison.
-Well, with her in charge,

01:45.939 --> 01:47.975
-I think you have
a decent chance. -(chuckles)

01:48.008 --> 01:50.411
-(phone ringing) -Hey, maybe
you should just hear her out.

01:50.444 --> 01:53.647
(sucks air through teeth)
Yeah, I don't feel like it.

01:53.681 --> 01:55.115
-Give me the phone. I'll answer.
-No.

01:55.149 --> 01:57.017
Sabrina,

01:57.050 --> 01:59.620
answer the phone or I'll smash
your face off with this apple!

01:59.653 --> 02:01.289
-Not before I smash off yours.
-All right,

02:01.322 --> 02:03.624
-put the apples down before
I smash you both off. -Okay.

02:03.657 --> 02:05.326
Okay, Benny? Come on,
let's go look at the rabbits.

02:05.359 --> 02:06.994
I'm serious, Sabrina!
Answer the phone!

02:07.027 --> 02:09.797
-Oh, I'm sorry, does da wittle
baby miss his mama? -Cut it out.

02:09.830 --> 02:11.131
Last chance!

02:11.165 --> 02:12.366
-Oops!
-(shouts)

02:12.400 --> 02:14.134
-(chokes)
-SABRINA: Come here!

02:14.168 --> 02:16.170
-(choking)
-(Mickey choking, wheezing)

02:21.342 --> 02:22.876
-(Chip and Sabrina shouting in
distance) -What I wouldn't give

02:22.910 --> 02:24.645
to wrap my hands
around their necks

02:24.678 --> 02:27.047
and just squeeze the life out
of them.

02:27.080 --> 02:30.784
Yeah. I get that,
but that doesn't fly nowadays.

02:30.818 --> 02:33.487
Living in this PC culture
where everyone's got to drive

02:33.521 --> 02:36.123
a hybrid, people can't beat
their kids anymore.

02:36.156 --> 02:38.125
I'm not talking about the kids.
I'm talking about Christopher

02:38.158 --> 02:40.127
-and Poodle,
just living on easy street -Mm.

02:40.160 --> 02:41.895
while I'm here
picking up the pieces.

02:41.929 --> 02:43.130
Well, they are in prison.

02:43.163 --> 02:45.333
I am the one who is in prison.

02:45.366 --> 02:47.034
All right?
They're eating free meals,

02:47.067 --> 02:49.036
they've got clean sheets,
people looking after them.

02:49.069 --> 02:51.472
Meanwhile, I am literally living
in a trash heap

02:51.505 --> 02:54.208
with a bunch of wild animals
who don't respect me.

02:54.242 --> 02:56.477
-(shouting continues)
-Ah!

02:56.510 --> 03:00.147
They just have all this pent-up
aggression with no outlet.

03:00.180 --> 03:01.382
You want me
to take Chip downtown,

03:01.415 --> 03:03.551
get his wheels greased by a pro?

03:03.584 --> 03:05.219
No. Too expensive.

03:05.253 --> 03:07.054
No, these kids need
their parents.

03:07.087 --> 03:10.057
They need to sit face-to-face
and get all this out on them

03:10.090 --> 03:12.159
-so I can stop bearing the brunt
of it. -While you're there,

03:12.192 --> 03:15.396
-you might want to get the money
turned back on. -Count me in.

03:15.429 --> 03:17.998
I cannot wait to lay waste
to Poodle through the glass.

03:18.031 --> 03:19.933
-What are you talking about?
-Eh, you know, "You're in there,

03:19.967 --> 03:21.935
I'm out here."
That kind of stuff.

03:21.969 --> 03:23.571
Right. Well,
as productive as that sounds,

03:23.604 --> 03:24.705
you're not going.
This isn't about you.

03:24.738 --> 03:26.073
Aw, come on.

03:26.106 --> 03:28.676
-Let me get mine.
-(shouting continues)

03:28.709 --> 03:31.345
I want to know how
you're gonna get them on board.

03:31.379 --> 03:33.180
I'll just sit them down
like adults and explain that,

03:33.213 --> 03:35.716
in the long run, this is
the best thing for everybody.

03:35.749 --> 03:36.717
(Chip screams)

03:36.750 --> 03:38.419
Good luck.

03:38.452 --> 03:40.187
(groans softly)

03:40.220 --> 03:42.590
Where the hell are we?

03:42.623 --> 03:47.194
Look, sue me, I thought you
deserved a day of relaxation.

03:47.227 --> 03:49.597
This whole thing with your mom's
been pretty tough...

03:49.630 --> 03:51.599
Doesn't bother me
in the slightest.

03:51.632 --> 03:53.434
Uh-huh. All right.

03:53.467 --> 03:56.203
Well, maybe you've internalized
it a little bit

03:56.236 --> 03:58.439
-subconsciously because
you've been... -I haven't.

03:58.472 --> 04:00.040
Okay.

04:00.073 --> 04:01.875
Then we're just two ladies
having a spa day.

04:01.909 --> 04:03.210
Just go with it.

04:03.243 --> 04:05.646
What's so special
about this spa?

04:08.248 --> 04:10.217
Well, for starters,

04:10.250 --> 04:11.952
it's tough for me to say,

04:11.985 --> 04:15.623
because your journey is gonna be
so much different than mine,

04:15.656 --> 04:18.292
'cause it's an entirely
customized experience.

04:18.326 --> 04:21.128
That's the thing
that sets this particular...

04:21.161 --> 04:22.930
spa apart.

04:22.963 --> 04:24.932
You're gonna start by walking in

04:24.965 --> 04:28.336
and sitting down in a clay chair
that molds to your body.

04:28.369 --> 04:30.838
And then you'll have a chat
with Wesley.

04:30.871 --> 04:34.007
Yeah. Wesley's what they call
a body concierge.

04:34.041 --> 04:35.943
And, together,
the two of you will design

04:35.976 --> 04:39.112
a tailor-made experience
that will not only, you know,

04:39.146 --> 04:42.516
enrich your body but
it's also gonna take you on a...

04:42.550 --> 04:44.852
guided tour
of all of your pleasure centers.

04:44.885 --> 04:46.920
Wow.

04:46.954 --> 04:49.457
-I mean, that does sound
incredible. -Uh, yeah.

04:49.490 --> 04:51.459
(chuckles):
Yeah. It's amazing.

04:51.492 --> 04:53.927
Trust me, you're really gonna
love it. Oh, here we are.

04:53.961 --> 04:55.963
Milldale Correctional.

05:00.401 --> 05:02.302
(quietly):
You bitch.

05:06.974 --> 05:09.176
(groans)
What kind of demon tells a girl

05:09.209 --> 05:11.812
she's getting a spa day and then
brings her to her mom's prison?

05:11.845 --> 05:13.781
Look, think of it as a spa day
for your soul.

05:13.814 --> 05:15.148
What do you think
is gonna happen here?

05:15.182 --> 05:16.517
We're not just gonna kiss
and make up.

05:16.550 --> 05:17.951
I don't care what you do.

05:17.985 --> 05:19.887
Scream in her face.
Spit in her face.

05:19.920 --> 05:21.288
Slap her face.
Do whatever you got to do.

05:21.321 --> 05:23.123
But harness all that poison

05:23.156 --> 05:24.692
and spew it all over her,
you know?

05:24.725 --> 05:26.059
So I can stay out of it.

05:26.093 --> 05:27.728
(scoffs)

05:27.761 --> 05:30.297
Hello, Sabrina. Mickey.

05:30.330 --> 05:31.365
Hey there, Poodle.

05:31.399 --> 05:33.066
How's life in the big house?

05:33.100 --> 05:36.236
God, it feels good to be on the
other side of that one for once.

05:38.872 --> 05:39.840
I'm so glad you came.

05:39.873 --> 05:41.842
Well, it wasn't by choice, okay?

05:41.875 --> 05:43.977
-Listen, I have wanted to say...
-I'm sorry,

05:44.011 --> 05:47.515
can I go first? I-I just really
need to get this off my chest.

05:47.548 --> 05:48.516
(scoffs)

05:49.883 --> 05:53.654
Sabrina, I am so, so sorry.

05:53.687 --> 05:55.856
Yeah, I broke the law,
but, I mean,

05:55.889 --> 05:58.158
even worse, I broke our family.

05:58.191 --> 06:01.495
I've lied to you,
I've abandoned you,

06:01.529 --> 06:05.533
I've failed you in
every possible way as a mother.

06:05.566 --> 06:07.868
And I don't expect you
to forgive me,

06:07.901 --> 06:10.538
because I don't think
that I'll ever forgive myself

06:10.571 --> 06:15.409
for the pain that I've caused
you and Chip and Ben.

06:16.644 --> 06:18.111
Even Alba.

06:18.145 --> 06:21.615
I need you to know that
I love you more than anything

06:21.649 --> 06:23.451
and I am gonna spend
the rest of my life

06:23.484 --> 06:25.285
trying to make it up to you,
because you are

06:25.318 --> 06:28.922
the most important thing
in the world to me.

06:34.161 --> 06:36.564
Ooh, are the boys here, too?

06:36.597 --> 06:38.999
(indistinct chatter)

06:41.234 --> 06:43.270
Really? A water park?

06:43.303 --> 06:45.806
Why'd I spend an hour
looking for my goggles?

06:45.839 --> 06:48.275
'Cause once you commit to a lie,
you got to see it through, okay?

06:48.308 --> 06:50.744
You know what, uh, I think
we should abort, all right?

06:50.778 --> 06:52.112
This is no place for kids.

06:52.145 --> 06:53.881
But I want to see Daddy's camp.

06:53.914 --> 06:56.283
I know, but, you know,
we missed him, pal.

06:56.316 --> 06:58.285
You know?
He's off on a canoe trip.

06:58.318 --> 07:00.253
GUARD:
Pemberton! Booth six!

07:00.287 --> 07:02.790
-15 minutes! -No, you know what,
hey, let's go to the water park.

07:02.823 --> 07:04.792
All right? For real this time.
Let's do it.

07:04.825 --> 07:06.960
No. He doesn't get off
that easy.

07:06.994 --> 07:08.729
If he's not man enough
to talk to me,

07:08.762 --> 07:10.130
then I'll be the bigger man.

07:11.164 --> 07:12.966
All right. Fine.

07:13.000 --> 07:14.401
Make it quick.

07:14.434 --> 07:17.437
(exhales)
Hold my goggles.

07:21.775 --> 07:23.777
I like it here.

07:37.791 --> 07:39.760
Hello, Chip.

07:39.793 --> 07:42.395
Oh, my God, Dad.
Is that you?

07:43.463 --> 07:44.832
Where is your teeth?

07:44.865 --> 07:46.299
Oh.

07:46.333 --> 07:47.935
Y-You noticed that.

07:47.968 --> 07:48.936
Yes.

07:48.969 --> 07:51.805
Um, well, my roommate took them,

07:51.839 --> 07:55.375
and he said that-that I wouldn't
be needing them anymore.

07:56.644 --> 07:58.045
Oh, my God.

07:58.078 --> 08:00.047
No wonder you didn't
want me here.

08:00.080 --> 08:01.949
You didn't abandon me,

08:01.982 --> 08:03.551
you were protecting me.

08:05.819 --> 08:08.021
Well, now it's my turn
to protect you,

08:08.055 --> 08:10.023
'cause that's what
Pembertons do,

08:10.057 --> 08:12.159
we protect our own.

08:12.192 --> 08:13.961
Mark my words. (echoing):
I'm going to do everything...

08:13.994 --> 08:15.996
POODLE:
Chip's not yours.

08:16.029 --> 08:19.232
-that I can...
-POODLE: Chip's not yours.

08:19.266 --> 08:21.569
Dad? Dad.

08:21.602 --> 08:23.704
-(normal voice): Dad, are... ?
-I'm not your father.

08:23.737 --> 08:26.306
-Dad, don't say that.
-Well...

08:26.339 --> 08:28.909
I know you don't really feel
like yourself right now,

08:28.942 --> 08:32.079
but you're still my father
and I'm still your son.

08:32.112 --> 08:35.148
-Chip.
-Your own flesh and blood.

08:35.182 --> 08:38.518
-You don't under...
-Hello, gorgeous. -Move along.

08:38.552 --> 08:40.253
What the hell was that?

08:40.287 --> 08:43.824
That was my roommate... Ziggy.

08:43.857 --> 08:46.359
I don't think I like
the look of him at all.

08:46.393 --> 08:48.562
Chip, I-I don't want you
to visit me here anymore.

08:48.596 --> 08:50.397
-But, Dad, I...
-No "But, Dad."

08:50.430 --> 08:54.167
Just go, and... and...

08:54.201 --> 08:56.970
and don't you ever
come back here.

09:05.746 --> 09:07.881
(slurping)
You know what?

09:07.915 --> 09:09.216
I hate to admit it,

09:09.249 --> 09:10.784
but you were right.
(laughs)

09:10.818 --> 09:12.586
I feel like a tumor's
been removed.

09:12.620 --> 09:14.554
Right. Eh...

09:14.588 --> 09:17.124
Did anything about that apology
strike you as odd?

09:17.157 --> 09:19.960
-Like what?
-I don't know. Maybe just...

09:19.993 --> 09:22.596
How I was completely
left out of it? (laughs)

09:22.630 --> 09:23.997
Oh.

09:25.132 --> 09:26.399
-I see.
-What?

09:26.433 --> 09:28.101
This wasn't about me at all.

09:28.135 --> 09:30.103
It's about you and your
stupid issues.

09:30.137 --> 09:31.538
-What? No. Okay. Look.
-Mmm.

09:31.571 --> 09:33.273
Let me tell you a little
something about me.

09:33.306 --> 09:36.043
If I have an issue, it gets
resolved immediately, all right?

09:36.076 --> 09:37.711
I don't carry that slop around.

09:37.745 --> 09:39.412
It gunks up your gears.

09:39.446 --> 09:41.715
-Uh-huh.
-Okay. Two burgers.

09:41.749 --> 09:43.550
-Anything else I can do for you?
-Thank you.

09:43.583 --> 09:45.853
Um, yeah.

09:47.520 --> 09:49.790
Anything jump out at you
about this burger?

09:49.823 --> 09:52.559
-That it looks delicious.
-(chuckles)

09:52.592 --> 09:54.094
That's so cute, but no.

09:54.127 --> 09:56.229
Here's a little burger 101
for you, guy.

09:56.263 --> 09:59.132
If you put the fixings
underneath the patty,

09:59.166 --> 10:01.168
it cooks them,
thereby ruining them.

10:01.201 --> 10:03.436
-Get it?
-Not really.

10:03.470 --> 10:05.405
Uh, you want soggy lettuce?
Is that what you want?

10:05.438 --> 10:07.675
You want a tomato that goes down
like jelly in your mouth?

10:07.708 --> 10:09.576
You want,
you want to swallow toma--

10:09.609 --> 10:11.178
You like tomato jelly in your
mouth, that's what you like?

10:11.211 --> 10:13.246
So you want fresh lettuce.

10:13.280 --> 10:14.581
No. You're not getting it, guy.

10:14.614 --> 10:16.616
This is bigger than lettuce,
okay?

10:16.650 --> 10:18.418
The patty cooks the lettuce,

10:18.451 --> 10:20.320
which sogs the bun,
which compromises

10:20.353 --> 10:23.824
the entire structural integrity
of the burger.

10:23.857 --> 10:26.493
Y-You basically handed me
a bowl of wet meat.

10:26.526 --> 10:29.029
And I can't, for the life of me,

10:29.062 --> 10:30.530
remember looking through
the menu

10:30.563 --> 10:33.000
and ordering a bowl of meat.

10:33.033 --> 10:35.502
I will get you a new burger.

10:35.535 --> 10:37.370
Yeah. Okay. Good idea.

10:37.404 --> 10:40.007
Toss in a new attitude
while you're back there.

10:40.040 --> 10:42.575
Michael.

10:45.578 --> 10:49.149
-No unresolved issues at all,
huh? -Get in the car.

10:49.182 --> 10:52.652
-(man screams) -Sounds like
they're having fun in there.

10:52.686 --> 10:55.322
Well, someone is.

10:55.355 --> 10:57.390
Oh, all right, great.
Let's make moves.

10:57.424 --> 10:59.026
No, we can't leave.
I have to talk to the warden

10:59.059 --> 11:01.561
-and get Dad a new cell.
-Are you nuts?

11:01.594 --> 11:03.396
If word gets back that your
dad's talking to the warden,

11:03.430 --> 11:05.298
they're gonna turn him into
a pommel horse.

11:05.332 --> 11:07.667
I am not leaving until I know
my dad is safe.

11:07.701 --> 11:09.636
I don't care if I have
to get thrown in there.

11:09.669 --> 11:11.404
Okay, you're not getting
thrown in anywhere, all right?

11:11.438 --> 11:15.876
There's a way these things work
and I'll help you.

11:15.909 --> 11:17.144
What am I gonna do
with this kid?

11:17.177 --> 11:19.079
It's maximum security.

11:19.112 --> 11:22.482
He literally couldn't be
more secure.

11:22.515 --> 11:24.517
Hey, buddy. I'm gonna go help
your brother with something.

11:24.551 --> 11:25.886
You okay to sit tight?

11:26.920 --> 11:28.555
All right.

11:28.588 --> 11:31.825
Follow my lead.

11:31.859 --> 11:34.261
(locks buzzes, latch clicks)

11:42.469 --> 11:44.671
(groaning): Oh, please, Dom.
I'll fix it. I swear.

11:44.704 --> 11:46.506
-Uh, too late for that.
-(man groans)

11:46.539 --> 11:48.375
-You already had your chance.
-BEN: Hi.

11:51.078 --> 11:52.946
Yo.

11:52.980 --> 11:55.749
Am I tripping,
or is that a kid?

11:55.783 --> 11:57.851
Damn. Where'd you come from,
little man?

11:57.885 --> 11:59.052
I'm from Greenwich.

11:59.086 --> 12:01.454
Greenwich?
(laughs)

12:05.492 --> 12:07.094
Come over here.

12:09.462 --> 12:11.498
(groans)

12:12.766 --> 12:14.501
Take a good look
at this dude right here.

12:16.303 --> 12:18.638
You think he can be trusted?

12:19.807 --> 12:21.474
Hmm.

12:21.508 --> 12:23.643
(whimpers)

12:28.015 --> 12:29.950
Hmm...

12:29.983 --> 12:31.218
I like him.

12:31.251 --> 12:33.086
-(cries)
-You like him?

12:33.120 --> 12:34.387
Hey, fool. This little boy

12:34.421 --> 12:35.722
just saved your life.

12:35.755 --> 12:37.057
Thank him.

12:37.090 --> 12:39.559
Thank you, little boy.

12:39.592 --> 12:42.395
-You're welcome.
-(man panting)

12:42.429 --> 12:44.464
Don't go far, bitch.

12:48.101 --> 12:49.336
What's that?

12:49.369 --> 12:50.838
Just putting on some fresh ink.

12:50.871 --> 12:53.907
I love arts and crafts.

12:53.941 --> 12:56.176
What's Brass City?

12:56.209 --> 12:57.945
That's my hood, little man.

12:57.978 --> 13:00.413
'Cause we don't know
where you're going.

13:00.447 --> 13:02.482
All you got is where
you're from.

13:02.515 --> 13:04.351
Does it hurt?

13:04.384 --> 13:05.652
Only if you're a punk.

13:05.685 --> 13:07.654
Got any games here?

13:07.687 --> 13:09.089
Oh, yeah.

13:09.122 --> 13:12.659
(chuckling):
We got games.

13:12.692 --> 13:14.694
(door closes)

13:16.296 --> 13:17.630
Back already?

13:19.166 --> 13:21.835
(laughs) Yeah. I-I just--
I couldn't help notice

13:21.869 --> 13:24.504
that I was sort of left out
of the apology earlier,

13:24.537 --> 13:27.107
so in the spirit of closure
and forgiveness,

13:27.140 --> 13:28.775
it would really help me
turn the page

13:28.808 --> 13:30.978
if I could just...
just grab one real quick,

13:31.011 --> 13:32.880
and then we'll go.

13:34.647 --> 13:36.984
What am I apologizing
to you for?

13:37.017 --> 13:38.952
Uh, maybe for starters,

13:38.986 --> 13:40.988
dumping your entire family
on me?

13:41.021 --> 13:43.323
Oh. Uh, well, the way I see it,

13:43.356 --> 13:45.458
is your life had no meaning,

13:45.492 --> 13:47.527
and now you get to live mine.

13:47.560 --> 13:50.563
So, if anything, um...
you're welcome.

13:52.065 --> 13:53.800
Hey, that's apology-adjacent.

13:53.833 --> 13:56.904
I'm just looking for
a little gratitude here,

13:56.937 --> 14:00.707
because I'm doing a lot
for no money, so...

14:00.740 --> 14:02.675
(sighs)
It is always the money with you.

14:02.709 --> 14:04.744
Didn't I just give you
a million dollars?

14:04.777 --> 14:07.747
And then your pyromaniac son
burned it down in a house fire.

14:07.780 --> 14:09.849
Have some accountability,
Mickey. You don't hear me

14:09.883 --> 14:12.352
still complaining about that
time you stole my identity.

14:12.385 --> 14:13.853
I borrowed your identity.

14:13.887 --> 14:15.255
They're not gonna let you
rent a jet ski

14:15.288 --> 14:16.856
without a credit card.

14:16.890 --> 14:18.725
Did you need to ram it into
the side of a yacht?

14:18.758 --> 14:20.827
I'm sorry, I was drunk.

14:20.860 --> 14:22.395
Thanks to you I have a record
in Rhode Island.

14:22.429 --> 14:23.763
Is that why you never
came back to visit?

14:23.796 --> 14:26.066
We have been over this
a million times, Mickey.

14:26.099 --> 14:28.435
I had dreams
and I owed it to myself

14:28.468 --> 14:30.603
-to follow them.
-You became a stripper.

14:30.637 --> 14:33.106
-Wait, what? -I was a waitress.
-A waitress who wore nothing

14:33.140 --> 14:35.242
but a thong and heels.
-Is that true?

14:35.275 --> 14:37.110
-You slept with my boyfriend.
-That's because you slept

14:37.144 --> 14:39.512
-with Nick. -Oh, like you didn't
do the same thing with Derek.

14:39.546 --> 14:41.348
Damn, you guys tore through
a lot of dudes.

14:41.381 --> 14:44.184
-You chopped off my hair
-Yeah, as a joke.

14:44.217 --> 14:45.585
Okay. You know what?
Why don't you guys

14:45.618 --> 14:48.088
just call it even, okay?

14:48.121 --> 14:51.558
You wanted to get away
from Dad so badly

14:51.591 --> 14:53.226
that you abandoned me.

14:53.260 --> 14:55.795
I wanted to get away from you!

15:03.003 --> 15:05.138
If this place
wasn't crawling with guards,

15:05.172 --> 15:07.941
I would leap across this table
and rip you in half.

15:07.975 --> 15:11.979
Well, why don't we go somewhere
where we can be alone then?

15:12.012 --> 15:14.114
KEV:
No more bets.

15:14.147 --> 15:15.815
First one to the line wins.

15:15.848 --> 15:17.284
And... go!

15:17.317 --> 15:18.751
MAN:
Come on! Come on!

15:18.785 --> 15:22.089
(overlapping,
indistinct shouting)

15:22.122 --> 15:25.425
-(overlapping shouting)
-Go! Go! Go!

15:25.458 --> 15:27.660
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

15:27.694 --> 15:29.896
Little man gets the win!

15:29.929 --> 15:31.298
-Yeah!
-There we go.

15:31.331 --> 15:33.466
Nice haul, kid.
You're a natural.

15:33.500 --> 15:34.934
Thanks. I hope my dad has

15:34.968 --> 15:36.836
as much fun in here as you guys.

15:36.869 --> 15:39.672
-Who's your daddy?
-Chris Pemberton.

15:39.706 --> 15:43.876
Yo, that's Ziggy's boy.

15:46.113 --> 15:48.748
-You guys know him?
-Oh, we do now.

15:48.781 --> 15:51.018
You guys can keep these,
by the way.

15:51.051 --> 15:53.987
I'm not allowed near fire
since I burned down my house.

15:55.022 --> 15:57.657
(loud laughter)

15:57.690 --> 15:59.492
-Oh! Ho, ho, ho.
-Yay!

15:59.526 --> 16:02.529
This is a very delicate dance,

16:02.562 --> 16:06.333
and a good chance for you
to learn something, so sit back.

16:08.701 --> 16:13.306
(belching)

16:13.340 --> 16:15.175
Completely lost
my train of thought.

16:15.208 --> 16:16.876
I can smell it
through the glass.

16:16.909 --> 16:19.379
What do you guys want?

16:19.412 --> 16:23.716
Uh, we're associates
of your cellmate, Christopher.

16:23.750 --> 16:27.354
Oh. You mean Debra?

16:27.387 --> 16:29.156
Come on, man.

16:29.189 --> 16:30.690
I know
there's got to be something

16:30.723 --> 16:32.325
we can do for you
on the outside.

16:32.359 --> 16:34.194
Some loose ends
that need tying up?

16:34.227 --> 16:36.163
No, thanks.

16:36.196 --> 16:37.997
You son of a bitch, you listen

16:38.031 --> 16:39.899
to me and you listen good.
This is obviously

16:39.932 --> 16:41.834
a money play,
so quit wasting my time.

16:41.868 --> 16:46.639
What's it gonna be?
Ten? 20? 30?

16:46.673 --> 16:48.141
Stop me when I hit your number.

16:48.175 --> 16:50.643
I don't really care about money.

16:50.677 --> 16:53.213
I'm locked in here
for the rest of my life.

16:53.246 --> 16:55.315
Nothing more
than an animal in a cage.

16:55.348 --> 16:57.484
Like a reptile in the zoo.

16:57.517 --> 17:01.821
Now, if you'll excuse me...

17:01.854 --> 17:04.424
I'm gonna go play
with my favorite toy.

17:10.630 --> 17:13.066
-Are you guys serious? You're
way too old for this. -Butt out,

17:13.100 --> 17:15.768
-Sabrina. -Yeah, sweetie.
Mama's gonna destroy your aunt.

17:15.802 --> 17:18.271
I hope they have a good plastic
surgeon in here 'cause

17:18.305 --> 17:20.107
-you're probably gonna need
a new nose j... Whoa! -Oh.

17:20.140 --> 17:21.908
See, one of the few good things
about this place

17:21.941 --> 17:23.276
is the free workout classes.

17:23.310 --> 17:24.777
Cardio kickboxing
five days a week.

17:24.811 --> 17:27.347
-Oh, yeah?
How's their optometrist? -What?

17:27.380 --> 17:29.549
Oh! My eyes!

17:29.582 --> 17:32.352
(grunting)

17:32.385 --> 17:34.921
-Hey.
-(Mickey grunts)

17:34.954 --> 17:37.124
-(fence rattles)
-Hey. Oh!

17:37.157 --> 17:38.958
(both grunting)

17:41.060 --> 17:42.295
(gasps)

17:42.329 --> 17:44.864
-You should eat your veggies...
-No.

17:44.897 --> 17:48.067
...so you can grow up
big and strong!

17:48.101 --> 17:50.137
(Mickey grunts)

17:50.170 --> 17:52.205
(Mickey yelling)

17:52.239 --> 17:54.141
-(Poodle groaning)
-Oh! Oh!

17:54.174 --> 17:56.042
-Aah!
-Submit.

17:56.075 --> 17:58.245
-Never! -I swear to God, Mickey,
I will break your finger.

17:58.278 --> 17:59.646
Oh, please. You don't have...

17:59.679 --> 18:02.048
-(bone crunching, yelling)
-Oh. Sorry.

18:02.081 --> 18:04.050
Oh. I warned you.

18:04.083 --> 18:06.886
-(Mickey groans)
-(bone clicking) -Oh.

18:06.919 --> 18:09.422
Oh, now I'm just gonna have
to break something of yours.

18:09.456 --> 18:11.324
-Don't know when to quit,
do you? -(yelling)

18:11.358 --> 18:12.925
(Poodle groaning)

18:12.959 --> 18:14.327
Oh, God. Put down!

18:14.361 --> 18:16.163
Ugh. Hey.

18:16.196 --> 18:19.599
-We're on the same team. No.
-Ugh! You selfish bitch!

18:19.632 --> 18:21.934
-Today was supposed
to be about me... -(shrieking)

18:21.968 --> 18:25.138
...and my closure,
not you and your petty crap

18:25.172 --> 18:27.106
-from 50 years ago!
-Take it easy. Take it easy.

18:27.140 --> 18:28.641
(Sabrina yells loudly)

18:28.675 --> 18:30.177
You withered old monsters!

18:30.210 --> 18:32.179
No. Aah!

18:36.849 --> 18:39.452
-Listen, I just want you guys
to know that, uh... -Save it.

18:39.486 --> 18:40.920
Me, too.

18:40.953 --> 18:42.989
Same here.

18:43.022 --> 18:45.958
Oh, though I got to say,
that was pretty therapeutic.

18:45.992 --> 18:47.794
Visiting time's over.

18:47.827 --> 18:50.197
Uh, wait.

18:50.230 --> 18:52.999
Hey. Sorry about your finger.

18:53.032 --> 18:55.535
Don't sweat it.
I got a ton of 'em.

18:55.568 --> 18:57.170
And I'll talk to the lawyers,

18:57.204 --> 18:59.806
make sure that you have
all the money that you need.

18:59.839 --> 19:02.309
=Thank you.
-GUARD: Let's go.

19:04.143 --> 19:05.378
Bye, Mom.

19:05.412 --> 19:07.214
Bye, sweetie.

19:09.148 --> 19:11.484
-I'm gonna miss you guys.
-You remember what I told you?

19:11.518 --> 19:13.953
Always keep your head down
and your chin up.

19:13.986 --> 19:16.356
My man.

19:17.557 --> 19:19.692
(sighs)
Stay up, little man.

19:23.563 --> 19:25.465
(sighs)

19:25.498 --> 19:26.966
Say hi to my dad if you see him.

19:26.999 --> 19:28.835
You gonna stop setting fires?

19:28.868 --> 19:30.136
I promise.

19:30.169 --> 19:31.338
Good boy.

19:35.007 --> 19:37.644
-What's this? -So you have
something to play with.

19:37.677 --> 19:39.546
Thanks, little man.

19:39.579 --> 19:41.714
(sighs)

19:41.748 --> 19:44.150
I know just where
I'm gonna put it.

19:44.183 --> 19:47.487
(clicks his tongue)
Yeah.

19:47.520 --> 19:49.822
Dad's not gonna make it, is he?

19:49.856 --> 19:51.558
Oh, I don't know.

19:51.591 --> 19:54.160
You'd be amazed at what
the human spirit can endure.

19:54.193 --> 19:56.596
(Jimmy sucks air
through his teeth)

20:02.769 --> 20:06.239
Hey, honey, I'm home.

20:07.474 --> 20:09.276
You fellas need something?

20:09.309 --> 20:11.278
-(blow landing, squishing)
-(groaning)

20:11.311 --> 20:14.781
(groans)

20:14.814 --> 20:17.216
DOMINIC:
And that's for the little man.

20:20.119 --> 20:22.088
(Christopher whimpers)

20:22.121 --> 20:24.791
MICKEY: I've never seen her
move like that in her life.

20:24.824 --> 20:27.960
-(laughter) -No, no, no.
I want more details.

20:27.994 --> 20:29.796
Was it open hand, closed fist?

20:29.829 --> 20:31.264
-It was a fair amount of both.
-Ah.

20:31.298 --> 20:32.932
This one blasted Poodle
with a tree.

20:32.965 --> 20:35.802
-Yeah. -No. Man,
I wish I had been there.

20:35.835 --> 20:37.570
-Yeah, you would've liked it.
-ALBA: Yeah.

20:37.604 --> 20:39.572
Yeah, I wish we'd done it
sooner. It was cathartic.

20:39.606 --> 20:41.808
-What do you say we visit
your dad next weekend? -Nice.

20:41.841 --> 20:44.210
No. Maybe, uh, hold off on that,

20:44.243 --> 20:48.481
'cause, uh, Christopher is
still... adjusting.

20:48.515 --> 20:50.717
Yeah, to being
a lizard man's plaything.

20:50.750 --> 20:53.252
(phone buzzes)

20:53.286 --> 20:56.556
-Hello?
-CHRISTOPHER: Chip, it's me.

20:56.589 --> 21:00.059
-Daddy? -Oh, listen, I only have
a minute, but I... I wanted you

21:00.092 --> 21:02.161
to know that things have gotten
a lot better for me here

21:02.194 --> 21:04.831
-since you left.
-Really? Dad, that's great news.

21:04.864 --> 21:07.266
It is, and-and I'll tell you
all about it later,

21:07.300 --> 21:09.969
but I got to run, um,
but I'll call soon.

21:10.002 --> 21:13.440
And I hope
that you'll always know that

21:13.473 --> 21:16.409
I will love you like a son.
Good-bye, Chip.

21:16.443 --> 21:19.011
Like a son?

21:34.627 --> 21:37.630
Ha. You can burn
that off. No problem.

Where are your teeth?

21:48.307 --> 21:50.276
Hope you
enjoyed
kickin' it
with The Mick.

21:50.309 --> 21:52.545
