00:27.652 --> 00:28.737
With a little red nose.

00:28.820 --> 00:30.238
(kisses) Aw.

00:30.321 --> 00:32.574
I still feel like it's too soon
to take these down.

00:32.657 --> 00:34.492
It's only been a week since Christmas.

00:34.576 --> 00:36.995
Eight days, Mom. Which I happen to know

00:37.078 --> 00:39.039
because I've been trying
to solve this stupid thing

00:39.122 --> 00:40.123
since Christmas!

00:40.206 --> 00:41.458
Come on, little ball.

00:41.541 --> 00:44.377
Get out of your cage.
Get out of your cage!

00:44.461 --> 00:47.047
My stocking stuffer
brings only joy and peace.

00:47.130 --> 00:49.090
-(playing harmonica)
-Gene? Gene?

00:49.174 --> 00:51.009
-You said you were taking a little break?
-What?

00:51.092 --> 00:52.719
I couldn't hear you over my harmonica.

00:52.802 --> 00:55.347
Is that hat for your hands?
Have I been wearing hats wrong?

00:55.430 --> 00:57.557
No. Santa thought my head
was a little smaller,

00:57.640 --> 01:00.060
so I'm just stretching it out.

01:00.143 --> 01:02.145
So, you're still
putting Christmas stuff away?

01:02.228 --> 01:04.898
Yeah. Say sweet dreams
to the clothespin angel.

01:04.981 --> 01:07.484
-Sweet dreams, clothespin angel.
-Kiss 'em.

01:07.567 --> 01:08.610
-What?
-Kiss 'em.

01:08.693 --> 01:09.861
No. No, thank you.

01:09.944 --> 01:11.905
I don't want to kiss
any more ornaments, Lin.

01:11.988 --> 01:13.490
That's kind of why
I went into the kitchen.

01:13.573 --> 01:16.117
Also to juice with my antique juicer

01:16.201 --> 01:18.620
that you got me
which I love more than life.

01:18.703 --> 01:21.164
-That you told me to get you.
-Yeah, and I was right

01:21.247 --> 01:22.540
about how good a gift that would be.

01:22.624 --> 01:24.709
Just like the perfume that I got you.

01:24.793 --> 01:26.086
I love my perfume.

01:26.169 --> 01:27.796
Joy by Joy Behar.

01:27.879 --> 01:29.297
Just brings so much joy.

01:29.381 --> 01:31.549
I miss your old smell
of grease and crackers.

01:31.633 --> 01:33.426
So, do you need us to keep helping

01:33.510 --> 01:36.554
with this incredibly long
taking down the tree process?

01:36.638 --> 01:38.932
No, you guys helped the first three hours.

01:39.015 --> 01:40.475
-It's fine.
-Well, in that case,

01:40.558 --> 01:42.894
I'd like to intro-juice you

01:42.977 --> 01:44.521
to Orange Lemon Basil.

01:44.604 --> 01:46.147
I can't wait to taste the difference

01:46.231 --> 01:47.774
between this and Orange Lemon Mint.

01:47.857 --> 01:50.694
Uh, forget Orange Lemon Mint.
I was a different person then.

01:50.777 --> 01:53.446
(exhales)
Okay, done with ornaments. Moving on

01:53.530 --> 01:55.323
to holiday cards. Aw, look at 'em.

01:55.407 --> 01:57.158
All the beautiful, smiling families

01:57.242 --> 01:58.702
telling me Season's Greetings.

01:58.785 --> 02:01.413
All the teenagers
going through awkward phases.

02:01.496 --> 02:03.498
-Oh, yeah, a bunch of other Tinas.
-What?

02:03.581 --> 02:06.292
You know, I don't think we got
as many cards as we usually get.

02:06.376 --> 02:08.336
Maybe we're being shunned?
Because they're all jealous

02:08.420 --> 02:10.714
of our perfect skin
and our long, long lashes?

02:10.797 --> 02:12.882
Oh, my God.
We <i>are</i> being shunned.

02:12.966 --> 02:15.510
We're getting taken off
of people's Christmas card lists.

02:15.593 --> 02:17.929
Why would we get taken off
people's Christmas card lists?

02:18.013 --> 02:19.347
Because of our long, long lashes?

02:19.431 --> 02:21.599
No, because I couldn't
get it together this year

02:21.683 --> 02:23.852
to send our card out.
Or last year.

02:23.935 --> 02:25.437
And that's how it happens.

02:25.520 --> 02:27.647
You stop giving, you stop getting.

02:27.731 --> 02:29.190
-Like high fives?
-Yeah.

02:29.274 --> 02:31.401
Right. So, why didn't you send one out?

02:31.484 --> 02:34.446
-Seems easy enough.
-Well, excuse me, Miss Missy.

02:34.529 --> 02:36.781
Hardest thing of all is getting
a good picture of this family.

02:36.865 --> 02:38.825
It's like wrangling
a bunch of muddy babies.

02:38.908 --> 02:40.452
You people probably don't remember

02:40.535 --> 02:42.537
the last picture we sent out, but I do.

02:42.620 --> 02:45.206
Tina's eyes were half-shut,
Gene was all blurry,

02:45.290 --> 02:47.334
and Louise was doing a serial killer face.

02:47.417 --> 02:48.960
And that was the good picture.

02:49.044 --> 02:51.004
You mean this serial killer face?

02:51.087 --> 02:53.590
-Aah! Yes. Uh, stop it.
-Stop what?

02:53.673 --> 02:56.176
Stop it. Ugh. Look how good
these pictures are.

02:56.259 --> 02:59.220
Look at my cousin Valerie
and her family on that cruise.

02:59.304 --> 03:01.848
They were all pointing
towards land or a whale

03:01.931 --> 03:04.309
or a dolphin.
And ours was in a grocery store.

03:04.392 --> 03:05.602
That was the best we could do,

03:05.685 --> 03:07.771
standing in front
of that pineapple display.

03:07.854 --> 03:09.189
Oh, my God, pineapple.

03:09.272 --> 03:10.690
Bob, for a minute, stop with the juice.

03:10.774 --> 03:12.525
-Uh, never.
-Remember that year

03:12.609 --> 03:14.235
we tried to take our picture
in that guy's yard

03:14.319 --> 03:15.362
because he had a nice fountain,

03:15.445 --> 03:17.155
and then he came out and got real mad?

03:17.238 --> 03:19.532
Why have a fountain if you won't
let people do a <i>Friends</i> in it?

03:19.616 --> 03:21.284
Lin, I think you're being
too hard on yourself.

03:21.368 --> 03:24.245
They're just cards.
We'll take a good picture next year.

03:24.329 --> 03:25.580
It's not a big deal.

03:25.663 --> 03:27.832
Not a big deal?!

03:27.916 --> 03:30.168
Um, I-I mean, isn't that true?

03:30.251 --> 03:32.504
Thin card that gets thrown away?

03:32.587 --> 03:34.964
-Not a big deal?
Uh, why is your eye twitching?
-(Linda grunting)

03:35.048 --> 03:37.425
And she's kind of balling up
her hands into fists.

03:37.509 --> 03:40.261
Linda, breathe.
Bob doesn't know what he's talking about.

03:40.345 --> 03:42.681
You know what?
It's still January, right?

03:42.764 --> 03:45.350
-I mean, yes?
-It's January somewhere.

03:45.433 --> 03:47.727
So, 'tis still the season, sorta.

03:47.811 --> 03:50.146
We're still in the winter.
We still have time, right?

03:50.230 --> 03:53.024
-For what?
-If we went out somewhere nice

03:53.108 --> 03:54.317
to take a picture today,

03:54.401 --> 03:55.902
we could get cards printed tomorrow,

03:55.985 --> 03:58.947
send them and still be in
the holiday card-giving window.

03:59.030 --> 04:01.658
We'd be back in
the card-getting business, baby.

04:01.741 --> 04:03.618
Uh, w-wait, today? I mean...

04:03.702 --> 04:06.496
Come on! You know it's gonna be
a slow day at the restaurant.

04:06.579 --> 04:08.915
Everyone's still on winter break,
winter breaking.

04:08.998 --> 04:11.042
I just figured that
if it's a slow day in the restaurant,

04:11.126 --> 04:14.004
I could play-- I mean, <i>work--</i>
with the new juicer

04:14.087 --> 04:16.423
that you so thoughtfully got for me,

04:16.506 --> 04:17.924
my great love.

04:18.008 --> 04:19.634
Yeah, and this is our last day of freedom

04:19.718 --> 04:21.177
before we have to go back to school.

04:21.261 --> 04:23.805
Today, my only plan is to sit on my butt

04:23.888 --> 04:26.683
and solve this fun/infuriating puzzle.

04:26.766 --> 04:28.184
Aah! Dang it.

04:28.268 --> 04:31.021
I was planning on becoming
a harmonica virtuoso today.

04:31.104 --> 04:32.439
-(playing harmonica)
-Gene, buddy?

04:32.522 --> 04:34.941
Please? You're killing me.
You are killing me.

04:35.025 --> 04:36.526
Everybody, we're doing this.

04:36.609 --> 04:37.861
So, come on, get dressed!

04:37.944 --> 04:40.030
-Let's go. Let's go. Go, go, go!
-ALL: No!

04:40.113 --> 04:42.490
All right! And I found the perfect place.

04:42.574 --> 04:44.951
I looked it up, and it's gorgeous.
We're on our way.

04:45.035 --> 04:46.536
Uh, wait, what's the name of this place?

04:46.619 --> 04:48.038
Eh, don't worry about the name.

04:48.121 --> 04:49.581
Wh-Why don't worry about the name?

04:49.664 --> 04:51.958
It's, uh, it's called s-something lookout.

04:52.042 --> 04:53.793
-Okay.
-Three Mile Lookout.

04:53.877 --> 04:56.087
What does that mean?
You can see for three miles?

04:56.171 --> 04:57.756
-Whoa.
-Yeah, maybe.

04:57.839 --> 05:00.133
Or, uh, or because
it's a three-mile walk to get there.

05:00.216 --> 05:01.885
-What?
-What? Let me out!
-What? Pull over!

05:01.968 --> 05:03.845
-Drive, Bob, drive!
Put the child locks on.
-(kids shouting)

05:03.928 --> 05:06.389
-What? We-we don't have child locks.
-Just drive!

05:08.475 --> 05:11.019
(Linda whoops)
Three Mile Lookout,

05:11.102 --> 05:13.271
here we come.
Then it's just a three-mile walk

05:13.355 --> 05:14.773
to a beautiful lookout.

05:14.856 --> 05:16.816
-BOB: Mm.
-You're not my mother right now.

05:16.900 --> 05:18.193
Oh, I can just see it.

05:18.276 --> 05:19.736
Us in nature.

05:19.819 --> 05:22.364
Everyone smiling, looking at the camera.

05:22.447 --> 05:23.782
Some of us wearing hats?

05:23.865 --> 05:25.241
What do you think?
Pom-pom to the left?

05:25.325 --> 05:27.369
Pom-pom to the right?
Left? Or right?

05:27.452 --> 05:29.037
-Left? Right?
-Tina, shh.

05:29.120 --> 05:30.705
-Busy. Puzzle.
-Okay, but real quick?

05:30.789 --> 05:33.208
Anyone have any requests,
or shall I just riff?

05:33.291 --> 05:34.501
-(plays harmonica) Aah!
-Tina.

05:34.584 --> 05:36.378
-Sorry.
-Hey, kid in the middle.

05:36.461 --> 05:37.962
Okay, I need room to work here, people.

05:38.046 --> 05:39.214
-Ow!
-Ow!

05:39.297 --> 05:41.466
Kids, no fighting.
When we take this picture,

05:41.549 --> 05:43.134
everyone's got to smile and mean it.

05:43.218 --> 05:45.762
No grouchy grumps.
Bob, that goes for you, too.

05:45.845 --> 05:48.306
-Are you still mad
that I'm making you walk?
-Yes.

05:48.390 --> 05:49.891
I love you.

05:49.974 --> 05:52.394
In my head, I'm juicing right now.

05:55.146 --> 05:57.273
Here, Bob, take the snacks.
I got the camera.

05:57.357 --> 05:59.776
-I'll take the snacks
-N-No, no, that's okay, Gene.

05:59.859 --> 06:01.736
-I-I got it.
-Ah, you don't trust me.

06:01.820 --> 06:03.405
-And rightly so.
-RANGER: Hey.

06:03.488 --> 06:04.614
Going for a nice winter hike, huh?

06:04.698 --> 06:06.366
No.
We're here against our will.

06:06.449 --> 06:08.034
-Wait, what?
-No. (chuckles)

06:08.118 --> 06:09.411
We didn't kidnap them.

06:09.494 --> 06:10.620
Oh, well, that's a relief.

06:10.704 --> 06:12.288
Now I don't have to fill out that form.

06:12.372 --> 06:13.540
You know, actually, we're here to take

06:13.623 --> 06:15.166
a perfect holiday family photo.

06:15.250 --> 06:16.918
Isn't it a little too late for that?

06:17.002 --> 06:18.628
No! It's still during the window.

06:18.712 --> 06:20.463
-Uh, Lin.
-What?

06:20.547 --> 06:23.383
Well, you guys seem great.
Okay, be safe, don't litter,

06:23.466 --> 06:25.385
and no kicking pine cones.
They don't like it.

06:25.468 --> 06:27.262
Mom, you know what I'm thinking?

06:27.345 --> 06:30.098
This parking lot
is absolutely breathtaking.

06:30.181 --> 06:31.766
We should take the picture here.

06:31.850 --> 06:33.601
Oh, yeah.
That's a great idea.

06:33.685 --> 06:36.688
So artistic if we did it, actually,
just right here.

06:36.771 --> 06:39.941
What? No. We're taking
a really, really nice picture.

06:40.025 --> 06:41.943
It's our big comeback.
We're going up.

06:42.027 --> 06:44.029
Wait, "up"?
There's "up" involved in this?

06:44.112 --> 06:45.697
Yes.
It's called a lookout.

06:45.780 --> 06:47.449
You have to go up to look out.

06:47.532 --> 06:49.701
Everywhere's a lookout.
I'm looking out right now.

06:49.784 --> 06:52.662
No. Come on. Everyone, practice
your smiles and follow me.

07:03.089 --> 07:06.176
(breathes deeply)
Thank you.

07:09.804 --> 07:12.182
The air's thinner up here, right?
Is the air thinner?

07:12.265 --> 07:15.101
People shouldn't walk up hills.
Gravity doesn't want us up here.

07:15.185 --> 07:18.063
Did a bird poop twice on you guys, too?

07:18.146 --> 07:21.441
(gasps) Oh, it's even better
than I imagined.

07:22.525 --> 07:24.361
Okay, take a minute
to get yourselves camera-ready.

07:24.444 --> 07:25.904
Tina, get that poop off.

07:25.987 --> 07:27.530
Do I have time for a blowout?

07:27.614 --> 07:30.033
My glam squad
is about 20 minutes behind us.

07:30.116 --> 07:31.117
Not this time, baby.

07:31.201 --> 07:32.285
Bob, you're steaming.

07:32.369 --> 07:33.953
Maybe try to get that under control?

07:34.037 --> 07:35.872
(panting):
Okay. I'll try to stop.

07:35.955 --> 07:37.707
You look like a Cup O' Noodles over there.

07:37.791 --> 07:39.209
All right, I'm gonna
try and figure out this timer.

07:39.292 --> 07:40.669
These things are easy, right?

07:40.752 --> 07:43.296
Oops! Wait, is this
on ten seconds or three?

07:43.380 --> 07:44.464
-(camera clicking)
-Hold on.

07:44.547 --> 07:46.049
Aah! I pressed the timer.

07:46.132 --> 07:47.384
Why'd it take a picture?

07:47.467 --> 07:49.260
-Aah!
-Lin, do you want help?

07:49.344 --> 07:50.679
No, no, I got it.

07:50.762 --> 07:53.223
-Oh, come on!
-Uh, h-here, let me try.

07:53.306 --> 07:54.766
-(timer beeping)
-Okay, I think we're set.

07:54.849 --> 07:56.601
-Butt shot.
-Nice!

07:58.103 --> 07:59.479
Geez, what kind of timer is this?

07:59.562 --> 08:01.773
Who can move that fast?
Cheetah people?

08:01.856 --> 08:03.817
I mean, we're Cheeto people.

08:03.900 --> 08:05.985
Okay.
Oh, I think I just reset the date.

08:06.069 --> 08:08.405
And I might have taken, like,
30 pictures up my nose.

08:08.488 --> 08:10.907
-There's your Christmas card.
-Oh, ratzafratz!

08:10.990 --> 08:13.118
Uh, maybe we don't all have to be in it?

08:13.201 --> 08:15.495
Maybe I take it, and you can tell everyone

08:15.578 --> 08:18.123
that I left you to join the Army,

08:18.206 --> 08:20.166
and you're bravely carrying on without me.

08:20.250 --> 08:23.628
Even though I'm braver
because I joined the Army.

08:23.712 --> 08:26.006
I already thought of that.
Doesn't work.

08:26.089 --> 08:27.507
What if people see you in the restaurant?

08:27.590 --> 08:29.676
Can't you just say he's Dad's hot twin?

08:29.759 --> 08:31.886
-This plan is perfect. I like it.
-All right, we're doing

08:31.970 --> 08:33.638
the hot-twin-Army-Dad plan.
Let's do this.

08:33.722 --> 08:35.390
Oh! Hikers!

08:35.473 --> 08:38.059
-Hello! Hi!
-Uh, yeah?

08:38.143 --> 08:40.395
Uh, can you take our picture?

08:40.478 --> 08:43.273
Uh, okay!
Just, we're very far away from you!

08:43.356 --> 08:45.400
You won't be able to make out your faces!

08:45.483 --> 08:47.235
Oh, no, not from over there!
Over here!

08:47.318 --> 08:49.988
On our camera!
Please!

08:50.071 --> 08:51.990
We need a family picture!
It's an emergency!

08:52.073 --> 08:53.992
Oh, okay!

08:54.075 --> 08:56.244
Oh, thank you so much.
We really appreciate it.

08:56.327 --> 08:58.788
(panting):
Sure. It wasn't too far out of the way.

08:58.872 --> 09:00.373
-It was pretty far.
-It was pretty far.

09:00.457 --> 09:02.167
Louise, put the toy down.
Come on. We're doing this.

09:02.250 --> 09:03.877
Fine, I'll do it behind my back.

09:03.960 --> 09:06.546
Okay, everyone squish in
and say "ravioli."

09:06.629 --> 09:08.715
ALL:
Ravioli.

09:08.798 --> 09:10.175
-Got it.
-You know what?

09:10.258 --> 09:11.634
Could you just take a few more

09:11.718 --> 09:13.470
-just for safety?
-Okay.

09:13.553 --> 09:15.764
All right, everyone's eyes open?
Bob, you still steamy?

09:15.847 --> 09:18.600
Wait, I was talking.
Can you take it again?

09:18.683 --> 09:20.727
You know, I know it doesn't really matter,

09:20.810 --> 09:22.645
but can you smile while you take it?

09:22.729 --> 09:24.564
I think we'll get
a better smile out of the kids.

09:24.647 --> 09:26.733
Right?
Your face is kind of tight.

09:26.816 --> 09:29.611
-Okay, thank you!
-All right.

09:29.694 --> 09:31.279
We're done. Let's go.

09:31.363 --> 09:32.447
-Oh, they're awful.
-What?

09:32.530 --> 09:34.407
Bad.
They're all bad.

09:34.491 --> 09:37.160
Shadow. Shadow.
Ugh, they're all in shadow.

09:37.243 --> 09:39.245
And Gene's completely
turned around in this one.

09:39.329 --> 09:42.082
-I had to go.
-Maybe silhouette could be our thing?

09:42.165 --> 09:44.376
Like, you can't see our faces.
Who are we?

09:44.459 --> 09:46.336
Like, a-a mystery card.

09:46.419 --> 09:47.962
Oh, her stupid thumb's in this one.

09:48.046 --> 09:49.714
Ugh. Stick to hiking, sweetie.

09:49.798 --> 09:53.218
Okay, so, I guess we wait
for another hiker to come along?

09:53.301 --> 09:55.762
-Maybe it'll be Annie Leibovitz.
-I have a better idea.

09:55.845 --> 09:58.056
We make a hang glider
out of Dad's underwear,

09:58.139 --> 09:59.432
and we glide down to the parking lot

09:59.516 --> 10:00.767
-and go home.
-That sounds nice.

10:00.850 --> 10:02.560
Oh, I got the timer working!

10:02.644 --> 10:04.145
We don't need any more dumb hikers!

10:04.229 --> 10:06.898
And we're switching locations.
The sun's facing that way.

10:06.981 --> 10:08.274
You people stand there.

10:08.358 --> 10:10.318
I'm putting the camera here
on this nice rock.

10:10.402 --> 10:12.779
Hello, rock.
Thank you for being here.

10:12.862 --> 10:15.156
Kids, you'll be back in your jammies
before you can say,

10:15.240 --> 10:17.033
"Oh, my God, what a great Christmas card."

10:17.117 --> 10:19.577
Okay, but I'm pretty sure
I used up all my fierceness.

10:19.661 --> 10:21.830
Wait, I found a little more. Mm.

10:23.915 --> 10:26.042
-Oh, this is it! This is the moment.
-(timer beeping)

10:26.126 --> 10:27.961
Smile, people. Smile, please.

10:28.044 --> 10:30.130
-I'll never ask for anything again.
-Wait, my hat.

10:30.213 --> 10:31.715
Wait, my this.
(farts)

10:31.798 --> 10:33.425
-Gene.
-Bob! Bob, smile.

10:33.508 --> 10:35.635
-Everyone, you're not smiling!
-(farts) Oh, whoops.

10:35.719 --> 10:36.761
-(Louise laughs)
-Yay, Dad!

10:36.845 --> 10:39.180
Okay. Okay.

10:39.264 --> 10:41.349
Okay.

10:42.851 --> 10:45.437
Uh, oh, no. Is it that bad?

10:45.520 --> 10:47.939
-Is it Tina's hat?
-No! Oh, God, no.

10:48.023 --> 10:49.733
It's... it's...

10:49.816 --> 10:51.901
-Yeah?
-It's perfect.

10:51.985 --> 10:53.069
It's more than perfect.

10:53.153 --> 10:55.155
It's-it's the picture I have in my head

10:55.238 --> 10:56.698
when I think of you guys.

10:56.781 --> 10:58.450
It's that double fart magic.

10:58.533 --> 11:00.744
-So does that mean...
-We got it?

11:00.827 --> 11:02.287
We got it!

11:02.370 --> 11:03.913
-Oh, thank God.
-Oh, yeah!

11:03.997 --> 11:05.248
First one to the car gets to drive.

11:05.331 --> 11:06.416
Okay.

11:06.499 --> 11:07.876
Oh, thanks, everyone.

11:07.959 --> 11:10.170
I know it was a long day
and exercise is very difficult

11:10.253 --> 11:12.088
and awkward for this family,
but this is really...

11:12.172 --> 11:13.840
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

11:16.468 --> 11:18.553
No...!

11:18.636 --> 11:20.680
Got it! I got it. I got the camera.

11:20.764 --> 11:22.223
-Thank God.
-(sighing heavily)

11:22.307 --> 11:23.933
Oh, that was close.
Okay, I'm pullin' it out.

11:25.852 --> 11:27.479
-Oh. Oh, no.
-What, "oh, no"?

11:27.562 --> 11:29.522
The hole's not wide enough
for my hand and the camera.

11:29.606 --> 11:31.107
Wh-What are you talking about?

11:31.191 --> 11:33.360
I can't get my arm out without
lettin' go of the camera,

11:33.443 --> 11:35.070
and if I let go of the camera...

11:35.153 --> 11:36.696
Yeah, that would be bad.

11:38.198 --> 11:39.699
Should I play a mournful blues?

11:39.783 --> 11:41.951
-Probably not.
-I should.
-♪ ♪

11:44.037 --> 11:47.540
-(all straining)
-Okay, okay, maybe we can...

11:47.624 --> 11:50.251
Ow, ow, no. Mommy's elbow
doesn't go that way.

11:50.335 --> 11:52.003
I can't see any way to get the camera.

11:52.087 --> 11:53.505
I can't reach it from any angle.

11:53.588 --> 11:56.007
Uh, maybe if we had a trained bird?

11:56.091 --> 11:57.509
Oh, now you want a trained bird.

11:57.592 --> 12:00.512
Before Christmas it's all,
"We can't get a trained bird."

12:00.595 --> 12:02.055
Maybe we could try to train that squirrel?

12:02.138 --> 12:03.973
Hi... Oh, he's gone.

12:04.057 --> 12:06.017
Okay, what if we drop the camera--

12:06.101 --> 12:08.895
wait, hear me out--
and not do this anymore?

12:08.978 --> 12:10.146
Ooh, he likes it. He likes it.

12:10.230 --> 12:11.356
She's frowning.

12:11.439 --> 12:15.068
Lin, at some point
we might have to consider

12:15.151 --> 12:16.319
saying goodbye to the camera.

12:16.403 --> 12:17.904
No. Never.

12:17.987 --> 12:20.240
The best picture our family has
ever taken is on this thing.

12:20.323 --> 12:21.866
You didn't see it. I saw it!

12:21.950 --> 12:23.785
(straining):
It was like a... a fairy tale,

12:23.868 --> 12:25.870
but in... but in real life.

12:25.954 --> 12:28.456
But maybe we don't need a
picture on the Christmas card.

12:28.540 --> 12:30.458
Just some nice words?

12:30.542 --> 12:31.626
I'm ready with the bubble letters.

12:31.710 --> 12:33.336
Oh, Tina, I love your bubble letters,

12:33.420 --> 12:35.380
but that's the worst idea
anyone's ever had.

12:35.463 --> 12:36.965
Okay, let me try something.

12:37.048 --> 12:38.717
Hey, Mom, can you show me how
to eat corn on the cob again?

12:38.800 --> 12:40.802
I forget how and I need to know.

12:40.885 --> 12:42.637
For school. Uh, corn school.

12:42.721 --> 12:44.347
Uh-uh. I'm not fallin' for the old

12:44.431 --> 12:46.725
"How do I eat corn on the cob" trick.
Who even knows.

12:46.808 --> 12:48.893
-Damn, she's good.
-Maybe I try something.

12:48.977 --> 12:51.312
Hey, Mom, what number comes after nine?

12:51.396 --> 12:54.107
-What? Ten.
-Right, but, um,

12:54.190 --> 12:56.192
show me on your fingers how many ten is.

12:56.276 --> 12:58.862
For, um, corn school. Crap.

12:58.945 --> 13:01.531
-Nope.
-Mom, I need a hug. A two-armer.

13:01.614 --> 13:03.241
Uh-uh, Gene. Hug your father.

13:03.324 --> 13:05.201
All right, Dad, let's do this.

13:16.588 --> 13:19.257
(moaning):
Oh, oh, my hand's gettin' so tired.

13:19.341 --> 13:21.676
-Oh, no.
-Does it want to go home and take a nap?

13:21.760 --> 13:23.553
Here, Mom, you can use my hat
to cushion your arm.

13:23.636 --> 13:25.680
(grunting) Little help?

13:28.266 --> 13:29.559
(sighs):
Ah, thanks, Tina.

13:29.642 --> 13:30.935
That pom-pom feels nice.

13:31.019 --> 13:33.355
Kids, have snacks and enjoy the day.

13:33.438 --> 13:34.606
Yay, snacks.

13:34.689 --> 13:36.941
This boy wouldn't say no
to some hot cocoa.

13:37.025 --> 13:39.110
Blah. What is this?!

13:39.194 --> 13:40.362
It-It's my juice.

13:40.445 --> 13:41.738
Did you put it in there as a prank?

13:41.821 --> 13:43.406
No. And don't waste it.

13:43.490 --> 13:44.949
I-I think I juiced, like, 30 oranges

13:45.033 --> 13:46.451
to fill this thing.

13:46.534 --> 13:48.244
This is not a juice situation, Father.

13:48.328 --> 13:49.954
Gene, I will ground you so hard.

13:50.038 --> 13:52.791
Sorry. Sorry.
I-I just miss my juicer so much.

13:52.874 --> 13:55.001
Yeah, we heard you two singing together.

14:03.593 --> 14:05.303
Why couldn't you have just
juiced some hot chocolate,

14:05.387 --> 14:06.596
you psychopath?!

14:06.680 --> 14:08.181
I guess that's it.

14:08.264 --> 14:09.766
We're out here in the snow
like a bunch of Jeremiah Johnsons

14:09.849 --> 14:11.768
and there's nothing we can do about it.

14:11.851 --> 14:13.853
Louise, no one's turning
into Jeremiah Johnson.

14:13.937 --> 14:16.272
Also, I don't know
how you know that movie.

14:16.356 --> 14:17.941
It's a movie?
I just made up the name

14:18.024 --> 14:19.150
'cause it sounded good.

14:19.234 --> 14:21.569
What?
No, it's a... Oh, forget it.

14:24.364 --> 14:26.366
Okay, the plan to squirt
a bunch of soap down there

14:26.449 --> 14:28.910
and twist my arm out didn't work
'cause we don't have soap.

14:28.993 --> 14:31.246
And that idea to pry my arm out
with a stick

14:31.329 --> 14:33.998
really didn't work, and now
there's a stick stuck in here.

14:34.082 --> 14:35.500
And my hand's gettin' numb.

14:35.583 --> 14:37.252
My hands are getting numb, too.

14:37.335 --> 14:38.795
Dang it. How am I supposed
to solve this dumb thing

14:38.878 --> 14:40.630
with dumb numb hands?

14:40.714 --> 14:41.923
Agh!
Hey, just curious--

14:42.007 --> 14:43.466
are we gonna be spending the night here?

14:43.550 --> 14:45.301
'Cause if so, we're gonna
need to add a few rooms

14:45.385 --> 14:46.594
to this thing.

14:46.678 --> 14:49.014
Oh. Make sure my room
has a California King.

14:49.097 --> 14:50.348
And I want jets in the tub.

14:50.432 --> 14:51.850
Lin, it's gonna start getting dark soon,

14:51.933 --> 14:54.144
and we still need to hike
three miles back down.

14:54.227 --> 14:55.395
Also, the snacks are gone.

14:55.478 --> 14:56.938
Guess we're gonna have to scavenge.

14:57.022 --> 14:58.732
Tina, go find that squirrel, befriend it

14:58.815 --> 15:00.025
-and then betray it.
-Fine.

15:00.108 --> 15:01.401
No! We're not eating squirrels

15:01.484 --> 15:02.944
and we're not spending the night.

15:03.028 --> 15:04.904
Just leave me here.

15:04.988 --> 15:06.448
Uh, uh, go back down to the car.

15:06.531 --> 15:07.949
I'll-I'll figure it out.

15:08.033 --> 15:09.451
-'Kay.
-Bye, Mom.
-Miss you.

15:09.534 --> 15:11.703
Guys, no. We're not going
anywhere without your mother.

15:11.786 --> 15:12.912
But snacks!

15:12.996 --> 15:14.873
Oh, oh! I-I have a lozenge in my pocket.

15:14.956 --> 15:17.208
Everyone take a lick, and-and maybe, uh,

15:17.292 --> 15:18.752
huddle together to stay warm.

15:18.835 --> 15:21.129
Blow on each other with
your nice hot family breath.

15:21.212 --> 15:23.381
I'm saving my hot breath for this.

15:23.465 --> 15:25.717
-(playing harmonica)
-No!

15:25.800 --> 15:27.385
Oh, it's you folks again. Heh.

15:27.469 --> 15:29.220
That sounded like Bob Dylan
got caught in a trap.

15:29.304 --> 15:31.848
-Thank you.
-Would you look at that sunset?

15:31.931 --> 15:34.017
Wow.
You folks get a good picture?

15:34.100 --> 15:36.269
(laughs weakly)
Uh, funny story.

15:36.353 --> 15:38.396
-Can it be a short story?
-Eh, it's pretty short.

15:38.480 --> 15:39.981
Uh, my wife dropped the camera,

15:40.065 --> 15:42.609
but then she caught it,
now her hand is stuck in that hole.

15:42.692 --> 15:44.611
Yeah, she won't let go of it,
but if she did,

15:44.694 --> 15:46.905
we could leave and go to our warm house.

15:46.988 --> 15:48.239
Sorry, did I say that out loud?

15:48.323 --> 15:49.908
Mr. Ranger, here's the thing:

15:49.991 --> 15:51.910
the best picture
we've ever taken as a family

15:51.993 --> 15:53.328
is on this camera.

15:53.411 --> 15:54.746
I need it to make holiday cards

15:54.829 --> 15:56.706
because we never sent them out
the last couple years,

15:56.790 --> 15:58.416
and-and people are startin' to take us off

15:58.500 --> 16:00.210
their card-giving lists,

16:00.293 --> 16:01.461
-and-and-and if we...
-Uh, sure, sure, sure, sure, sure.

16:01.544 --> 16:03.713
-Look, we see this all the time.
-Really?

16:03.797 --> 16:05.715
No. I just wanted to stop you from talking

16:05.799 --> 16:07.050
-so I can tell you something.
-Yeah?

16:07.133 --> 16:08.301
You have to go.

16:08.385 --> 16:09.844
No one can be in this park after sunset.

16:09.928 --> 16:11.930
Yup, uh, we'll-we'll be outta
here in a jiff.

16:12.013 --> 16:14.182
Uh, I'm about to crack this thing here.

16:14.265 --> 16:17.602
Well, it's sunset now,
so you have to go right now.

16:17.686 --> 16:19.437
This is like, the main part of my job.

16:19.521 --> 16:21.231
Well, I mean,
this and cleaning the bathroom.

16:21.314 --> 16:22.691
Which I definitely always do.

16:22.774 --> 16:25.151
Well, I'm not going anywhere
without this camera.

16:25.235 --> 16:26.653
-You're not leaving?
-No.

16:26.736 --> 16:29.280
Okay.
So this is your first warning.

16:29.364 --> 16:31.324
Oh, um, how many warnings are there?

16:31.408 --> 16:33.410
There's three, and we're nearing
warning number two.

16:33.493 --> 16:35.286
It's comin' around the bend.

16:35.370 --> 16:37.706
Here she comes, and second warning.

16:37.789 --> 16:39.416
(sighs)
Lin, maybe just do what he says?

16:39.499 --> 16:42.335
I can't, Bob.
I can't let go of this camera.

16:42.419 --> 16:44.671
Third warning means
I got to take away your park pass.

16:44.754 --> 16:46.047
We were supposed to have a park pass?

16:46.131 --> 16:47.590
I mean, oh, uh-oh.

16:47.674 --> 16:49.009
Do you not have a park pass, sir?

16:49.092 --> 16:50.760
Oh, uh, no, we do.

16:50.844 --> 16:55.265
I was just thinking of another,
uh, pass that we have.

16:55.348 --> 16:57.017
Oh, yeah.
We have so many passes.

16:57.100 --> 16:58.476
-I, uh, pass, pass, pass, pass.
-We hike all the time.

16:58.560 --> 16:59.978
-Oh, so much. We love it.
-Yeah.

17:00.061 --> 17:01.896
Well, you guys didn't let me finish.

17:01.980 --> 17:03.273
I'm gonna take away your park pass,

17:03.356 --> 17:05.525
I issue you a ticket,
and if you don't come willingly,

17:05.608 --> 17:08.069
that's called "́resisting a park ranger."

17:08.153 --> 17:10.572
But who can resist a man in uniform?
Sorry.

17:10.655 --> 17:12.741
So you're gonna have to pay a hefty fine,

17:12.824 --> 17:15.160
your family's gonna
be escorted out of the park,

17:15.243 --> 17:17.120
and that's probably not the best way

17:17.203 --> 17:19.247
to wrap up a quality family outing.

17:19.330 --> 17:21.541
Anyway, warning number three.

17:21.624 --> 17:24.377
-Lin, please.
-I, uh...

17:24.461 --> 17:25.545
Do we have permission to tickle her?

17:25.628 --> 17:27.630
Do we have permission?!

17:29.716 --> 17:32.552
BOB:
Lin, I know this means a lot to you,

17:32.635 --> 17:33.887
but there's a ranger here
who is gonna make us pay

17:33.970 --> 17:36.598
a lot of money
and also maybe carry you out?

17:36.681 --> 17:38.683
Or me out?
I'm not sure which.

17:38.767 --> 17:40.685
-Let's play it by ear.
-Please carry me out.

17:40.769 --> 17:43.855
Can you just, maybe, I'm sorry, but,

17:43.938 --> 17:45.607
-let go of the camera?
-No way.

17:45.690 --> 17:48.109
I'm not throwing away my shot of us.

17:48.193 --> 17:49.903
Look, folks, just to clarify,

17:49.986 --> 17:51.279
the third warning is not really a warning.

17:51.363 --> 17:53.615
It's like the final thing,
and I just said it,

17:53.698 --> 17:56.493
so that means now you're gonna
get Ranger arrested.

17:56.576 --> 17:58.203
So, how are we gonna do this?

17:58.286 --> 18:00.622
Come on, Mom, you're so obsessed!

18:00.705 --> 18:02.874
You got to learn to let things go.
Literally.

18:02.957 --> 18:04.793
Agh! Damn you, game!

18:04.876 --> 18:06.670
Why did Santa curse me with this...!

18:06.753 --> 18:09.130
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

18:09.214 --> 18:11.174
I just solved it!

18:11.257 --> 18:12.676
(laughing)
Yes. Yes!

18:14.969 --> 18:17.013
Okay.
Now my life has no purpose.

18:17.097 --> 18:18.932
That's, uh, great, Louise.

18:19.015 --> 18:20.642
Lin, please.

18:20.725 --> 18:23.520
Look, I know you all think
I'm crazy right now,

18:23.603 --> 18:25.480
but it's-it's more than just a picture,

18:25.563 --> 18:26.690
and the-the cards.

18:26.773 --> 18:28.525
It's about being a human.

18:28.608 --> 18:30.652
These cards connect us with other people.

18:30.735 --> 18:32.654
And when there's no people
left in the world,

18:32.737 --> 18:34.280
the aliens will find our cards

18:34.364 --> 18:36.950
and they'll be like,
"Aw, look at that family."

18:37.033 --> 18:39.369
Oh, fine. Forget it.

18:39.452 --> 18:41.955
My hand's so numb,
I probably should just drop it.

18:42.038 --> 18:43.748
Okay, here I go.

18:43.832 --> 18:45.291
-Ah...
-Wait, Mom, don't.

18:45.375 --> 18:47.502
-My puzzle.
-Yeah, I know, you solved your puzzle.

18:47.585 --> 18:49.087
I'm proud of you, baby.

18:49.170 --> 18:50.213
Didn't take you long at all.

18:50.296 --> 18:51.464
(coughs):
Eight days.

18:51.548 --> 18:53.883
No, I think I know
how to get you out of there.

18:53.967 --> 18:55.552
-And the camera.
-You do?

18:55.635 --> 18:57.429
Yeah.
We've been trying to turn your arm,

18:57.512 --> 19:00.056
but we need to turn you.

19:00.140 --> 19:03.059
-Me?
-So, we'd have to turn Mom upside down?

19:03.143 --> 19:04.644
I think so?

19:04.728 --> 19:06.688
I solved my puzzle by turning
the ball all the way around

19:06.771 --> 19:08.106
while pulling.

19:08.189 --> 19:09.441
Maybe that's how we get you out--

19:09.524 --> 19:11.651
we keep turning you until
we find the sweet spot,

19:11.735 --> 19:13.486
and then wham-bam, freedom, ma'am.

19:13.570 --> 19:14.696
Hopefully.

19:14.779 --> 19:16.406
-Huh.
-I mean, it's worth a try.

19:16.489 --> 19:18.241
I call all the change in her pockets.

19:18.324 --> 19:19.617
And her ChapStick.

19:19.701 --> 19:22.245
Um, Mr. Ranger, would you mind helping us

19:22.328 --> 19:24.122
turn my wife upside down?

19:24.205 --> 19:25.957
I thought you would never ask.

19:26.041 --> 19:28.001
-Oh. Really?
-But only because I'm a park ranger

19:28.084 --> 19:29.753
(clears throat)
and it's my job,

19:29.836 --> 19:31.296
and not because she just
made me cry a little bit

19:31.379 --> 19:32.714
and I miss my family.

19:32.797 --> 19:34.966
Uh, well, maybe if I grab here,
you lift there.

19:35.050 --> 19:36.676
Kids, take the legs.

19:36.760 --> 19:38.345
GENE:
This is exactly how
Cirque du Soleil got their start.

19:38.428 --> 19:40.013
All right, we good?
We ready?

19:40.096 --> 19:41.181
-KIDS: Ready.
-RANGER: Check.

19:41.264 --> 19:42.390
And, Lin, whatever you do...

19:42.474 --> 19:43.725
Yeah, yeah?
What, what?

19:43.808 --> 19:45.435
Don't drop that camera.

19:45.518 --> 19:48.480
Mwah. Even if my arm gets broken
into a million pieces.

19:48.563 --> 19:50.648
Well, no, then you should
probably drop it.

19:50.732 --> 19:53.068
Okay, here we go.
(grunting)

19:55.028 --> 19:56.905
LINDA:
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Watch it, watch it.

19:58.239 --> 20:00.950
Ah! We did it!
We actually did it!

20:01.034 --> 20:02.160
Oh, my God.
Hello, hand.

20:02.243 --> 20:03.912
Oh, come here, kids.
Oh, Bobby.

20:03.995 --> 20:05.163
Mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah.

20:05.246 --> 20:06.373
My family.

20:06.456 --> 20:07.916
(laughs)
I'm so happy for you guys.

20:07.999 --> 20:10.126
And I need you to immediately
leave the park.

20:10.210 --> 20:11.544
Uh, yup, right.
We're going.

20:11.628 --> 20:13.129
Thank you, Mr. Park Ranger.

20:13.213 --> 20:16.007
I've solved you, wooden puzzle,
and now I'm done with you.

20:16.091 --> 20:18.009
Return to the hell from which you came!

20:18.093 --> 20:20.303
Okay, well, please don't just
throw puzzles you're angry at

20:20.387 --> 20:22.180
-into the rock.
-Right. Sorry.

20:22.263 --> 20:25.225
And, hey, keep a lookout
in your ranger station mailbox

20:25.308 --> 20:27.519
for the best family portrait
card you've ever seen!

20:27.602 --> 20:29.854
And they walked out of my life.

20:32.482 --> 20:34.192
Anybody on lime time?

20:34.275 --> 20:36.861
-I'd love some water.
-No! No water.

20:36.945 --> 20:38.446
Water is stupid juice.

20:38.530 --> 20:40.990
Okay!
Who wants to see 'em?

20:41.074 --> 20:41.866
-Yes.
-Me.
-I do.

20:41.950 --> 20:43.243
Okay, printing's not cheap,

20:43.326 --> 20:44.828
so don't touch 'em if your hands
are gross and greasy.

20:44.911 --> 20:46.913
Well, they always are,
so what are you gonna do?

20:46.996 --> 20:48.289
-Yeah, we work in a restaurant.
-Eh?

20:48.373 --> 20:50.125
-LOUISE: Whoa.
-GENE: Ooh.

20:50.208 --> 20:51.084
-Hot damn.
-Wow.

20:51.167 --> 20:52.836
We'll never look that good again.

20:52.919 --> 20:54.254
I know.
Take it in.

20:54.337 --> 20:55.463
It's all downhill from here.

20:55.547 --> 20:57.048
For you, Dad, and Mom.

20:57.132 --> 20:59.134
-Not us. We're young.
-Thanks, Louise.

20:59.217 --> 21:00.844
-My wiener's out.
-What?!

21:33.960 --> 21:35.920
