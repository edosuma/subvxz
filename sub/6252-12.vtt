[ Baby Crying ]

00:04.547 --> 00:07.038
[Woman Screams ]
Okay.

00:07.133 --> 00:09.749
She’s six and a half centimeters.
It should be
a matter of minutes.

00:09.844 --> 00:12.460
Paul, I should go.
I don’t think
we’re gonna make dinner.

00:12.597 --> 00:15.054
She’s almost done.
It’s really late.

00:15.183 --> 00:17.299
Right.
And I’ve been waiting
for five hours.

00:17.435 --> 00:19.847
[Cell Phone Rings]
We can go to breakfast.
There’s a place around the corner...

00:19.979 --> 00:22.891
makes the best
French toast.
I really have to go.

00:22.982 --> 00:24.893
You’ll miss
the miracle of birth.

00:24.984 --> 00:27.441
Death’s calling
on the other line.

00:28.613 --> 00:31.104
Uh,coﬁee,
later today, 3:00?

00:31.199 --> 00:33.235
Think you can get away?

00:33.326 --> 00:34.941
I will.
l’ll clear the afternoon.

00:35.036 --> 00:36.742
Okay.

00:36.829 --> 00:40.947
[Woman ]
Get this baby out of me!
[ Screams ]

00:45.755 --> 00:48.918
Neechie, uh—
Neechie what?
Nixtamalization.

00:49.008 --> 00:54.253
The traditional Aztec method
used to prepare kernels
for consumption.

00:54.347 --> 00:58.306
Maize was a very important
aspect of Mesoamerican life.

00:58.434 --> 01:00.800
Where are we?
l have no idea.

01:00.895 --> 01:03.432
- I should’ve brought the G.P.S.
- Or a periscope.

01:04.315 --> 01:05.896
Here, you can be the periscope.

01:05.983 --> 01:07.598
No, thanks.

01:07.693 --> 01:09.809
You wanna be the guy
holding the periscope?

01:13.157 --> 01:14.897
[ Grunts ]
What do you see?

01:14.992 --> 01:18.484
Everything. This height
is extremely advantageous.

01:18.579 --> 01:20.695
Do you see the crime scene?

01:22.124 --> 01:24.957
Yes. The crime scene
is over there.

01:29.340 --> 01:31.501
- [ Saroyan ]
Here they come.
- [ Booth] I hear Cam.

01:31.592 --> 01:32.968
Cam?
Yeah.

01:33.052 --> 01:36.215
Cam? There you are.
I thought we were lost.

01:36.347 --> 01:38.588
This crime scene
is very remote.
And the corn is creepy.

01:38.683 --> 01:41.390
It is, right?
For a vegetable.
Or is it a grain?

01:41.477 --> 01:44.059
Maize is actually a grass.

01:44.146 --> 01:46.728
- Why are you so dressed up?
- Paul and l were headed
to dinner...

01:46.816 --> 01:48.647
when one of his patients
went into labor...

01:48.734 --> 01:50.690
and one of mine
turned up in a cornfield.

01:50.778 --> 01:52.484
Ooh, bummer.
Yeah.

01:52.571 --> 01:54.436
Nobody’s touched it.
l was waiting for you.

01:54.532 --> 01:56.363
The state of decomposition...

01:56.450 --> 01:59.863
and the height of the plants
beneath the body suggests
some passage of time.

01:59.954 --> 02:03.663
Well, what do they say
about corn? Knee high
by the Fourth of July?

02:03.749 --> 02:06.832
- [ Booth ]
How would you know?
- I did Oklahoma in high school.

02:06.961 --> 02:10.624
With the dry weather
we’ve been having, I’d say
he’s been dead maybe four weeks.

02:10.715 --> 02:13.206
Victim is male, early 40s.

02:13.342 --> 02:17.210
And judging by his clothes,
he was here to work.
Any ideas about cause of death?

02:19.140 --> 02:21.005
Oh. There we go.

02:21.100 --> 02:24.012
This is a homicide.
Evidence of a bullet wound
to the sternum.

02:24.103 --> 02:26.059
Gladiolus and the true ribs.

02:26.147 --> 02:27.762
Right. See a bullet in there?

02:27.857 --> 02:30.724
No. I don’t see
the exit wound clearly.

02:30.818 --> 02:34.561
Looks like the muzzle of the gun
was held in intermediate proximity,
close to the chest.

02:34.655 --> 02:36.691
Well, there’s gotta be
a bullet around here somewhere.

02:36.782 --> 02:39.364
[ Thunder Rumbles]
Uh, that was thunder.

02:39.452 --> 02:41.238
Yeah.
There’s lots to do.

02:41.329 --> 02:43.911
Let’s pull some soil samples
and get outta these guys’ way.

02:43.998 --> 02:46.831
-Are you prepared
to remove the body?
-Yeah. I got the bag right here.

02:46.917 --> 02:49.909
Forget about the bag.
You need a tarp now. This is
about to turn into Woodstock.

02:50.004 --> 02:51.790
Oh, uh, which way is the car?

02:51.881 --> 02:54.213
l have no idea.
We didn’t anticipate rain.

02:54.342 --> 02:56.048
Yeah. You never know.
Whoa!
[ Thunderclap]

02:56.135 --> 02:58.376
[ Saroyan ]
Let’s cover him up
before he’s soup.

03:33.089 --> 03:36.502
You got off easy, kid.
Mother Nature
cleaned these bones.

03:36.634 --> 03:39.125
She did a crappy job.
Shh!

03:39.220 --> 03:40.630
[Whispers ]
She can hear you.

03:40.721 --> 03:43.133
We bagged the body
before the hard stuff came down,

03:43.224 --> 03:45.089
but five minutes later
it was a mud bath.

03:45.184 --> 03:46.924
Man, why do | always
miss the fun?

03:47.019 --> 03:49.635
Something has been
snacking on this guy.

03:49.730 --> 03:51.766
A rodent with large incisors.

03:51.857 --> 03:55.349
Muskrats. The farmer
who owns the land said
he’s been having a problem.

03:55.444 --> 03:57.776
Well, did he by any chance
shoot at them?

03:57.863 --> 04:00.730
I don’t think so.
He has severe
rheumatoid arthritis.

04:00.825 --> 04:01.940
Oh.

04:02.034 --> 04:04.195
Look at this, Dr. Saroyan.

04:04.286 --> 04:07.449
| see a tangential entry wound,
but no radiating fractures.

04:07.540 --> 04:09.781
[ Saroyan ] It’s consistent
with a close-range shot.
What’s the diameter?

04:10.709 --> 04:12.995
15.89.

04:13.087 --> 04:16.955
Which could be anything
between a nine-millimeter
and a .38.

Has Agent Booth
found the bullet?

Hmm.

04:21.470 --> 04:24.337
I’ll check on the progress.

04:24.432 --> 04:28.266
“Not yet” is not an answer,
all right? So just keep looking.

04:28.352 --> 04:30.559
Right.

04:30.688 --> 04:32.519
What are you doing here?
Any luck
with the bullet?

04:32.606 --> 04:34.767
You know, they’re changing
the expression from, uh,

04:34.859 --> 04:37.020

to bullet in a cornfield.

04:37.111 --> 04:38.726
Well, let me know
as soon as you can.

this time of year.

04:40.489 --> 04:41.865
Right.

04:43.284 --> 04:45.275
You know what it means
if we don’t find it.

04:45.369 --> 04:48.236
- The guy wasn’t killed
in the cornfield.
- That’s it.

04:48.330 --> 04:49.991

here again?

To be honest, Seeley, l—
[ Clears Throat]

about something
personal.

04:58.215 --> 04:59.375
Oh.

04:59.467 --> 05:01.423
This is about your boyfriend.

05:01.510 --> 05:03.250
Ah, Paul’s not my boyfriend.

05:03.345 --> 05:05.176
We just see each other
once in a while.

05:05.264 --> 05:06.925
And every time we do,

05:07.016 --> 05:08.677
somebody’s water breaks
and he’s gotta go.

05:08.767 --> 05:10.382
That’s not his fault.

05:10.478 --> 05:12.935
He shares this practice
with six doctors.

05:13.022 --> 05:15.229
- He chooses to be this busy.
- You like this guy.

05:15.316 --> 05:18.433
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Okay, look.
Then it’s all about communication.

05:18.527 --> 05:20.233
You just gotta
give this guy a chance.

05:20.321 --> 05:22.983
But I feel like I have.
How many chances
does he deserve?

05:23.073 --> 05:24.233
Nine.

then don’t let him get away.

05:43.552 --> 05:45.463
[ Brennan ]
This doesn’t make any sense.

05:45.554 --> 05:48.341
A clay shoveler’s fracture
at the C7...

05:48.432 --> 05:51.014
indicates a life of hard labor,

05:51.101 --> 05:53.934
but anterior wedging
of the mid vertebrae...

05:54.021 --> 05:55.522
suggests that a great deal
of time...

05:55.606 --> 05:57.062
was spent in a seated position.

05:57.149 --> 05:58.650
He baled hay
and drove a tractor.

05:58.734 --> 06:00.474
But look at
the muscle attachments.

06:00.611 --> 06:03.023
Hmm. A result
of repetitive motion?
Yes.

06:03.113 --> 06:07.482
And there appear to be
stress fractures forming
at the radiocarpal joints.

06:07.576 --> 06:12.696
It’s as if this man spent
a great deal of time supporting
his weight on his hands...

06:12.790 --> 06:15.827
while engaging
in a repetitive motion.

06:20.506 --> 06:22.087
| get it.

06:22.174 --> 06:26.508
This motion would be reminiscent
of a primate having intercourse.

06:26.595 --> 06:28.881
We are looking for
a horny farmer.
Yes, we are.

06:28.973 --> 06:31.510

06:33.185 --> 06:35.597
He rents farm equipment
in the area where
the body was found.

06:35.688 --> 06:37.474
He went missing
about a month ago.

06:37.565 --> 06:39.271
He was wear/n9
a plaid shln‘, blue jeans.

06:39.358 --> 06:40.973
That sounds consistent.

06:41.068 --> 06:42.649
We 7/ need to conﬁrm
with dental records.

06:42.736 --> 06:44.601
Ask if he was horny.

06:44.697 --> 06:46.653
Oh, uh, was he promiscuous?

06:46.740 --> 06:50.358
I don’t know.
His wife Maryann’s
at home right now.

06:50.452 --> 06:52.363
Okay, I’m gonna
come pick you up.
Okay.

06:52.454 --> 06:55.946
[ Booth ] I mean,
what difference does it make
if he was promiscuous?

06:56.041 --> 07:00.159
[ Brennan ] The evidence
seems to indicate that the victim
spent a lot of time copulating.

07:02.673 --> 07:05.415
These are my children
and my, um, father, Dan,

07:05.551 --> 07:08.418

for your loss.
Thank you.

And thank you for coming.

07:16.228 --> 07:18.560
Hey, kids.
Let’s go to the park,
huh? Let’s go.

07:19.690 --> 07:21.521
Can we—
Oh, sure.

07:22.693 --> 07:24.524
Do you mind
if my sisters stay?

07:24.612 --> 07:28.855
Of course not.
So, tell us about
yourhusband,Ed.

07:28.949 --> 07:31.361
Uh, well, he was raised
right here in town.

07:31.452 --> 07:33.192
He always farmed
his parents’ land.

07:33.287 --> 07:35.243
And when l was pregnant
with our first son,

07:35.331 --> 07:38.573
he started
the equipment rental business
to help make ends meet.

07:38.667 --> 07:40.578
How many children
do you have?

07:40.669 --> 07:43.581
Eleven. We always wanted
a big family.

07:43.672 --> 07:47.335
Ed must’ve enjoyed having sex
with a pregnant partner.

07:47.426 --> 07:50.384
I can tell how much time
he spent copulating.

07:51.472 --> 07:53.258
So the night
that Ed disappeared?

07:53.349 --> 07:57.137
It was just any other night.
We were here making dinner
with the kids,

07:57.227 --> 07:59.479
and, um, hejust
never came home.

07:59.563 --> 08:01.770
Eventually
we called the police.

08:01.857 --> 08:04.018
Any reason to believe
why somebody would want
to hurt your husband?

08:04.109 --> 08:07.067
No. Everybody loved Ed.

08:08.197 --> 08:10.438
So, do you or your husband
own a gun?

08:10.532 --> 08:13.990
Yes, we do. Uh, Ed liked
to keep one for protection.

08:14.078 --> 08:15.784
It’s in the bedroom.

08:15.871 --> 08:18.453
I can show you to the bedroom.
This way.

what you’re “pensing” about?

08:48.070 --> 08:50.106
No, Dr. Hodgins.
I don’t.

08:50.197 --> 08:51.698
Is everything okay?

08:51.782 --> 08:53.613
Everything’s fine.

08:53.701 --> 08:56.033
What’s this about
potato particulates
in our cornfield?

08:56.120 --> 08:59.112
Ah, not in the cornfield.
I found them in the chest wound.

08:59.248 --> 09:02.206
Lots of ’em.
Uh, and look what I found
on his shirt.

09:02.292 --> 09:04.203
They’re called,
uh, anthers.

09:04.294 --> 09:06.626
It’s the pollen-bearing part
of certain flower stamens.

09:06.755 --> 09:08.871
Corn flower
or potato flower?
Neither.

09:08.966 --> 09:11.332
We’re talking about
a whole other plant entirely.

09:11.427 --> 09:14.544
This victim— he was like
a full-blown salad
of plant particulates.

09:14.680 --> 09:17.467
Then you should be
a happy man.
There’s no one happier.

09:17.558 --> 09:21.346
You see, Dr. Saroyan? It’s okay.
No one has a life around here.
[ Chuckles ]

09:30.529 --> 09:33.145
Are any of the children
the result of multiple birth?

09:33.240 --> 09:34.446
No.

09:34.533 --> 09:36.694
They’re congenitally deformed.

09:36.785 --> 09:38.525
Why would you say such a thing?

09:38.620 --> 09:42.033
Cranial proportion indicates
that all of these subjects...

09:42.124 --> 09:43.830
are less than 18 months old.

09:43.917 --> 09:45.953
Divided by average
human gestation and—

09:46.044 --> 09:49.377
They have small heads, Bones.
They look very cooperative
in that picture.

09:49.465 --> 09:51.672
I mean, someone takes a picture
of my kid, he hits ’em.

09:51.759 --> 09:54.501
The children are a blessing.

10:03.353 --> 10:06.686
Here’s his gun.
He doesn’t use it.
It’s just for protection.

10:06.774 --> 10:08.560
Does he have any bullets?

10:08.650 --> 10:12.142
I don’t see any,
but I will go to the closet
in the other room and check.

10:12.237 --> 10:13.818
Great.

10:13.947 --> 10:16.359

impossible.

10:37.971 --> 10:41.429
I suppose some people do.
Um, our family photos
are private.

10:41.517 --> 10:43.553
Not during a murder case.

10:43.644 --> 10:47.728
I understand your secrecy.
You must face great stigma
in the United States.

10:49.316 --> 10:51.432
- Bones, we should go.
- I understand the practicality.

10:51.527 --> 10:54.439
I studied a similar tribe
in Papua New Guinea.
I take it back.

10:54.530 --> 10:57.067
Those children
are not deformed, Booth.

10:57.199 --> 10:58.655

They—
[ Clears Throat]

10:58.742 --> 11:00.027
Let’s just— I’m sorry.
Let’s go.

11:00.118 --> 11:02.029
They have
three different mothers.

11:02.120 --> 11:04.611
Look. Ed and Maryann.

11:04.706 --> 11:06.833
Ed and Beth.

11:06.917 --> 11:09.033
Ed was married
to both of you?

11:10.546 --> 11:11.706
And Carol.

11:14.216 --> 11:18.084
These women
aren’t just sisters.
They’re sister-wives.

11:23.684 --> 11:27.176
American polygamy’s
primarily limited
to one tradition.

11:27.271 --> 11:29.387
Uh, these people
are Fundamentalist
Latter-Day Saints.

11:29.523 --> 11:32.936
Mormons.
No. They’re not sanctioned
by the mainstream church.

11:33.026 --> 11:36.359
Mormons abandoned
the practice of plural marriage
a long time ago.

11:36.446 --> 11:38.357
- How do you know
about this, Sweets?
- College paper.

11:38.448 --> 11:39.824
No. Television.

11:39.908 --> 11:41.990
The mainstream media
depicts plural marriage...

11:42.077 --> 11:44.568
as if it were the, uh,
proverbial bug in a jar.

11:44.663 --> 11:46.528
That’s just pretty strange,
if you ask me.

11:46.623 --> 11:48.705
Was Ed Samuel legally married
to all three sisters?

11:48.792 --> 11:51.408
One. The other two were married
in a religious ceremony.

11:51.503 --> 11:52.879
That’s how he stayed
out ofjail.

11:52.963 --> 11:55.045
Then it’s merely
a personal choice.

11:55.132 --> 11:59.171
Polygamy is a viable response
to many socioeconomic conditions.

11:59.261 --> 12:02.674
- Really? How so?
- Well, I can see
why a man might fantasize.

12:02.764 --> 12:04.595
Sweets, didn’t ask you.

12:04.683 --> 12:08.346
- Bones, go ahead. How so?
- For instance,
in ancient China,

12:08.437 --> 12:10.348
the male-to-female ratio
was skewed.

12:10.439 --> 12:13.727
We’re talking about
Virginia here. Okay?
Ratio is just fine.

12:13.817 --> 12:15.808
Swingers.
These guys were swingers.

12:15.903 --> 12:18.394
Swingers are, by definition,
couples who, with permission—

12:18.488 --> 12:20.649
Just stop, all right?
I’m saying is that,

12:20.741 --> 12:22.823
you know, multiple marriages—
great motive for murder.

12:22.910 --> 12:26.243
- You’re applying your own bias.
- No, actually, I agree
with Agent Booth on this one.

12:26.371 --> 12:27.747
Thank you.
You’re welcome.

12:27.831 --> 12:30.243
Polygamy may make sense
anthropologically,

12:30.334 --> 12:33.121
but jealousy is
a very powerful emotion.

12:33.211 --> 12:36.374
Free love taught us one thing—
open relationships
don’t necessarily work.

12:36.465 --> 12:38.831
- I mean, did these women
claim to be happy?
- They said they were.

12:38.926 --> 12:40.336
Did they have alibis?

12:40.427 --> 12:43.544
They were at home,
shouldering their
economic burden communally.

12:43.639 --> 12:45.675
Right. Clipping coupons.
You know what I should do?

12:45.766 --> 12:49.475
I should call
the sisters’ dad— Dan Lambertt.
How could he be cool with this?

12:49.561 --> 12:51.643
That’s a good place
to start.

12:54.274 --> 12:56.606
[Moaning]
I’m right behind you.

12:56.693 --> 12:58.149
Thanks.

12:58.236 --> 13:00.978
- Cam.
- What’s up?
We still on for that coffee?

13:01.073 --> 13:03.280
I can’t. I’m sorry.
I hate to jerk you around
like this.

13:03.367 --> 13:04.698
No. | get it.

13:04.785 --> 13:07.197
I told this woman
to stay off the trampoline.

13:07.287 --> 13:10.779
You do what you gotta do.
We’ve all got responsibilities.

13:10.874 --> 13:12.410
All right.
Listen, uh,

13:12.501 --> 13:15.208
when I say tomorrow,
I mean tomorrow.

13:15.337 --> 13:18.545

Talk to you then.
Safe delivery.

13:19.424 --> 13:21.585
That gun looks nice.

13:22.636 --> 13:25.719
Dr. Lidner,
she’s crowning.
Yeah.

13:28.266 --> 13:31.758
Honestly,
I thought my girls
were out of their minds.

13:31.853 --> 13:34.390
But you spoke with Ed
on a regular basis
for years.

13:34.481 --> 13:37.314
Ed and Maryann met at church
when they were teenagers.

13:37.401 --> 13:40.359
His family, our family—
all of us attended
the same place.

13:40.445 --> 13:43.687
Right. That, uh—
Let’s see. That Mormon church
up at Balding?

13:43.782 --> 13:46.364
Yeah. I thought
he was good for her.

13:46.451 --> 13:48.658
I couldn’t have been happier
when they got married.

13:48.745 --> 13:51.202
Then a few years later,
he comes to me,

13:51.289 --> 13:53.245
wants to take Beth
as his second wife...

13:53.333 --> 13:56.040
in some ceremony,
with Maryann standin’ right there.

13:56.128 --> 13:57.743
[ Scoffs ]

13:57.838 --> 14:00.580
- Says it was Maryann’s idea.
- Well, what’d you say?

14:00.674 --> 14:02.665
l was shocked.

14:02.759 --> 14:06.468
I mean, H—
The girls had always been close,
but like this—

14:06.555 --> 14:09.718
-They said it was
what they wanted.
-So you just went along with it?

14:09.808 --> 14:13.266
It’s not my business
to make life harder on my kids.

14:13.353 --> 14:16.220
- Where were you the night
that Ed disappeared?
- At work.

14:16.314 --> 14:19.647
I’m retired,
but I still take some shifts
at the hardware store.

14:19.776 --> 14:22.734
You know, your daughters—
they haven’t really been forthcoming
about their situation.

14:22.821 --> 14:24.857
I’m sure they weren’t.

14:24.948 --> 14:27.405
They don’t have it easy
around here, Agent Booth.

14:27.492 --> 14:29.869
My girls don’t deserve this.

14:29.953 --> 14:33.161
Neither did Ed.
No one should’ve had a problem.

14:33.248 --> 14:34.454
Who had a problem?

14:34.541 --> 14:36.907
A lot of people.
You talk to Pete Mill?

14:37.044 --> 14:40.787
Who’s Pete Mill?
He owns that pecan orchard
up the road.

14:41.715 --> 14:43.421
A month ago, someone...

14:43.508 --> 14:46.750
scratched “Plig”
on the hood of Beth’s car
and bashed out the windshield.

14:46.845 --> 14:48.130
Hmm. Plig.

14:48.263 --> 14:50.845
lt’s, uh, derogatory
for “polygamist.”
Right.

14:50.974 --> 14:54.341
You think he’s the one
who did this?
I know he did.

14:55.479 --> 14:57.720
So, Mr. Lambertt, you—
Do you own any guns?

14:57.814 --> 15:00.066
Yeah, a few for hunting.

15:00.150 --> 15:02.641
You can take ’em.
Take ’em all.

15:06.907 --> 15:09.068
Oh, that poor man.

15:09.201 --> 15:11.738
Three.
And they’re sisters.

15:11.870 --> 15:16.034
I heard you the first time.
But they don’t engage in sexual
intercourse in a group setting.

15:16.124 --> 15:18.160
Rather, they keep
a strict calendar.

15:18.251 --> 15:20.867
Why would one man
even want three wives?

15:20.962 --> 15:24.090
Well, with three wives,
he can produce 11 children
in eight years.

15:24.174 --> 15:26.039
I guess more people
to do dishes.

I’ll be ready.

15:41.691 --> 15:43.977
Is it safe to shoot

15:44.069 --> 15:47.061
Probably not.

behind the line?

15:47.155 --> 15:49.111
- Can I do it?
- No.

15:49.199 --> 15:51.815
You go look at some bones
and take some ear protection
with you.

the frontal curve
of the right iliac crest.

16:34.202 --> 16:36.409
And look at this.

16:36.496 --> 16:38.908
There are particulates
embedded in the exit wound.

16:38.999 --> 16:42.491
Look at the posterior aspect
of the seventh rib.

16:42.586 --> 16:43.826
A result of blowback.

16:43.920 --> 16:45.911
The bullet struck
a hard surface upon exit,

16:46.006 --> 16:48.338
causing the particulates
to propel backward.

16:48.425 --> 16:50.757
That’s correct.

You don’t know
if you farm pecans?

really guilty.
I’m sorry.

20:44.035 --> 20:46.492
I haven’t even been honest
with my sisters
about the divorce.

20:46.621 --> 20:50.113
Really? [Chuckles]
You don’t say, ’cause, you know,
I thought you shared everything.

20:50.208 --> 20:53.075
Not yet. I didn’t
want them to be hurt.

20:53.169 --> 20:56.036
l— Ed was still trying
to talk me out of it.

20:56.131 --> 20:58.622
Okay, you do realize
this looks more and more
like a motive for murder.

20:58.716 --> 21:00.581
Well, it’s not.

21:00.677 --> 21:04.386
I know it’s hard
for you to understand
why we live the way we do.

21:05.306 --> 21:07.262
It is our religious belief.

21:07.350 --> 21:09.466
You’re right.
You’re absolutely right.
I don’t understand.

21:10.937 --> 21:13.178
I just wanted
to look after my sisters.

21:13.273 --> 21:16.060
I didn’t mind sharing Ed,
as long as it was with them.

21:16.151 --> 21:19.564
All right. You cited
“irreconcilable differences.”
Can you be more specific?

21:22.365 --> 21:26.324
What? You wanted to sleep with Ed
on Wednesdays and Fridays...

21:26.411 --> 21:28.493
instead of Tuesdays
and Thursdays?

21:28.580 --> 21:29.865
No.

21:33.543 --> 21:36.034
Ed was having an affair.

21:42.427 --> 21:44.793
Hey.
Hey.

21:47.765 --> 21:50.472
What are those?
They’re particulates
from the blowback...

21:50.560 --> 21:53.893
that were lodged in the victim
after he was shot.

21:54.022 --> 21:56.729
That wasn’t clear at all,
was it?
I stopped listening.

21:56.816 --> 21:58.807
Okay.
After he was shot, right,

21:58.902 --> 22:00.813
the bullet went through him,

22:00.904 --> 22:02.769
and then it hit the wall
or something,

22:02.864 --> 22:06.197
and then the debris
blew back and lodged
into his spine.

22:06.284 --> 22:07.990
Was that any clearer?

22:08.077 --> 22:10.284
I don’t know, honey.
I stopped listening.

22:10.371 --> 22:12.157
The baby was moving.

22:12.248 --> 22:13.499
Man.

22:13.583 --> 22:16.871
I’m so jealous
that I don’t get to
feel him yet.

22:16.961 --> 22:20.954
Oh, don’t be upset.
It’s only the most
amazing thing in the world.

[ Gasps ]
You’re so cruel.

22:24.761 --> 22:26.626
You know,
with this baby coming,
we could, uh—

22:26.763 --> 22:29.596
we could really use
another wife.
Really?

22:29.682 --> 22:31.263
You want me
to marry another woman?

22:31.351 --> 22:34.559
No, not you. Me.
I could use the help.

22:34.646 --> 22:36.978
I’m gonna be like
a 24-hour restaurant.

22:37.065 --> 22:39.147
I will be your slave.
You know that.

22:39.234 --> 22:40.849
Would you want
another wife?

22:40.944 --> 22:42.354
Truth?

22:42.445 --> 22:44.356
[Chuckles]
Oh, I’m not sure.

22:44.447 --> 22:48.065
If I could marry you twice,
I would do it in a heartbeat.

22:50.078 --> 22:51.864
I wish we could
have sex at work.

22:51.955 --> 22:53.240
Mm-hmm.

22:53.331 --> 22:54.696
Really?
Yeah.

It’s this lab coat,
isn’t it?

22:56.334 --> 22:58.325
[ Hodgins]
Ooh.

22:58.419 --> 23:00.580
Well, they’re organic.

23:00.672 --> 23:01.832
Huh?

23:01.923 --> 23:04.630
The particulates.
Some kind of plant.

23:04.717 --> 23:06.582
Well, he was found
in a cornfield.

23:06.678 --> 23:09.511
Yes, but this is not corn.

23:09.597 --> 23:12.088
This baby’s gonna be
so proud of me.

23:13.685 --> 23:16.597
[Cell Phone Ringing]

23:21.025 --> 23:22.731
Your phone is ringing.

23:22.819 --> 23:24.309
Yeah. It’s Paul.

23:24.404 --> 23:27.487
- Oh, hot Dr. Paul?
- That’s the one.

23:27.574 --> 23:29.690
Uh-oh.
What did he do?

23:30.743 --> 23:32.404
Nothing.

23:32.495 --> 23:36.079
We’re just two ships
passing in the night. I don’t think
it’s gonna work out.

23:36.165 --> 23:37.905
Hmm.

23:38.042 --> 23:40.499
He must’ve done something.
No, he didn’t.

23:43.298 --> 23:45.254
Okay, he hasn’t kept a date
in three weeks.

23:45.341 --> 23:47.548
What is his excuse?

23:47.635 --> 23:50.547
Women in labor.
No, it’s a good excuse.
Don’t get me wrong.

23:50.638 --> 23:52.299
But I’m—
[Sighs]

23:52.390 --> 23:54.597
I’m just starting to wonder
how much he cares for me.

23:54.684 --> 23:56.845
I mean, best-case scenario,
he’s a workaholic.

23:56.978 --> 24:00.141
Well, then it’s a match
made in heaven.
If we ever saw each other.

24:00.231 --> 24:02.313
Oh. I get it.

24:02.400 --> 24:04.436
You’re blowing him off
so he’ll come crawling back.

24:04.527 --> 24:06.563
No. That’s not it at all.

24:06.654 --> 24:08.190
Yes, it is.

24:08.323 --> 24:10.939
I’m all for it.
I’m way too old
to play that game.

This isn’t a game.
You’re Cam.
You don’t wait around.

Go ahead
and make your plans.

then he’ll catch up.

24:18.082 --> 24:20.368
Booth says
I need to communicate.

24:20.460 --> 24:22.951
There’s more than one way
to communicate.

24:23.046 --> 24:24.752
Do you have a better strategy?

24:26.174 --> 24:27.380
[Sighs]

24:27.467 --> 24:31.210
[Cell Phone Ringing]

24:31.387 --> 24:34.595
[Angela] So, due to
the presence of blowback
in and around the wound,

24:34.682 --> 24:38.470
we know that the bullet
came into contact with
a hard object upon exit.

24:38.561 --> 24:40.472
For instance,
the wall.

24:40.563 --> 24:43.145
[Angela ]
Well, we don’t know that.
But let’s say the wall.

24:44.233 --> 24:46.895
Is that a plausible scenario?
I think so.

24:46.986 --> 24:49.272
Do we have
any more information
on the assailant?

24:49.364 --> 24:52.151
Booth thinks it may be
the victim’s first wife.

24:52.241 --> 24:55.404
Is the representation
of the victim’s height accurate?

24:55.495 --> 24:58.532
Seems Maryann may be too short
to hold the gun comfortably.

24:58.623 --> 25:01.239
No, the representation
is accurate.

25:01.334 --> 25:03.165
I cracked this nut wide open.

25:03.294 --> 25:07.003
How?
The particulates we found in
the blowback are actually pecan.

25:07.090 --> 25:11.049
We already know the victim
came into contact with the flower
of that same plant.

25:11.135 --> 25:13.717
Yes, but I’m not
talking about
an ordinary pecan.

25:13.805 --> 25:17.013
This pecan
has undergone a unique
digestive process...

25:17.100 --> 25:20.308
rendering it into,
for lack of a better word,
a rock.

25:20.395 --> 25:21.851
A digested pecan.

25:21.938 --> 25:25.146
What animal turns pecans
into rocks?

25:25.233 --> 25:27.144
Good question.
When we find the answer,

25:27.235 --> 25:31.569
there’s where Booth
will find his magic bullet and thus,
the scene of the crime.

25:31.656 --> 25:34.147
[Angela ]
Let’s see what happens
when I put him on the floor.

25:34.242 --> 25:35.732
[ Brennan ]
Why did you
do that?

25:35.827 --> 25:38.239
Well, what digested pecan
would be on the wall?

25:38.329 --> 25:41.742
Good point.
It’s far more likely
for feces to be on the floor.

25:41.833 --> 25:45.246
There you are.
I found out why our victim
had a mush mouth.

25:45.336 --> 25:47.748
Isotope results indicate
high levels of radium.

25:47.839 --> 25:49.454
That’s a bone-seeking isotope.

25:49.549 --> 25:52.837
Someone was likely
trying to poison Ed Samuel.

25:52.927 --> 25:54.633
Hmm.

25:57.390 --> 25:59.506
[ Booth ]
He was poisoned?
[ Brennan] It makes sense.

25:59.600 --> 26:02.763
His teeth and jaw clearly
suffered exposure over time.

26:02.854 --> 26:04.560
He was drinking it.

26:04.647 --> 26:07.263
That’s the number one way
that wives off their husbands.

26:07.400 --> 26:09.356
It is?
Seems like it is.

26:09.444 --> 26:11.856
But ultimately,
Ed Samuel was shot.

26:11.988 --> 26:16.106
Well, after she got tired of
waiting around for him to keel over
on the dining room table.

26:16.200 --> 26:20.443
- Which one do you think it was?
- I don’t think the wives
would have access to radium salt.

26:20.580 --> 26:22.696
Who would?
The use of radium salt...

26:22.790 --> 26:25.281
is limited to
scientific experimentation.

26:25.376 --> 26:27.913
- All right. Would a college
laboratory have it?
- It’s possible.

26:28.004 --> 26:33.044
Possible. ’Cause Ed Samuel
was dating a grad student
in his spare time.

26:42.101 --> 26:43.932
How’d you meet
Ed Samuel?

26:44.020 --> 26:46.261
I tutor his son Jasper
in chemistry.

26:46.355 --> 26:48.266
Ed brought him
to the lab on campus.

26:48.357 --> 26:50.393
Were you aware Jasper
had three mommies?

26:50.485 --> 26:53.022
No. I thought Maryann
was his mother.

26:53.112 --> 26:54.852
She picked him up
once in a while.

26:54.989 --> 26:57.321
So you slept
with her husband.
Yeah.

26:57.408 --> 27:01.697
I mean, I know it was wrong,
but really, it was no biggie.

27:01.788 --> 27:03.278
No biggie.

He bought me a really nice
used convertible.

How did you find out
about Beth and Carol?

27:10.046 --> 27:14.415
When they showed up one night
while I was finishing up
an assignment for the next day.

27:14.509 --> 27:17.296
All three of them.

27:17.428 --> 27:20.090
But Maryann did
all the talking.
What’d she say?

27:20.181 --> 27:22.467
She was calling me a whore...

27:22.558 --> 27:26.392
and said, like,
all this scary Bible stuff.

27:26.979 --> 27:28.515
I ran out.

27:28.606 --> 27:33.521
Now, do you have something
called, uh, radium salt
in your lab?

27:33.611 --> 27:35.021
We used to.

27:35.112 --> 27:38.104
We studied its use
as a fertilizer.

27:38.199 --> 27:41.441
It has to be kept in
a special box lined with metal,
marked “radioactive.”

27:41.536 --> 27:43.151
What happened to it?

27:43.246 --> 27:46.033
I don’t know.
I went to look for it
the other day, and it was gone.

Believe me, Agent Booth,
I did this alone. Maryann
and Beth knew nothing about it.

What were you thinking?
She has always been
a troublemaker.

28:40.011 --> 28:42.423

his surplus pecan crop...

33:18.747 --> 33:21.033
as food for livestock
through a local co-op.

This moron
was poisoned and shot.

34:05.628 --> 34:07.710
I’m surprised he wasn’t
stabbed and burned up too.

34:07.796 --> 34:09.957

is a little harsh
for someone...

a lifestyle you are
uncomfortable with.

ahead is too close,
it warns you and slows down.

Oh, right. So the car’s
smarter than our victim.

Anthropologically, the victim—
No, no, no. No.
No more anthropology.

34:28.984 --> 34:32.442
You live with three women,

for revenge and violence.

34:32.571 --> 34:34.357

Because human beings...

34:34.448 --> 34:36.188
are more complex than
anthropological tropes.

34:36.283 --> 34:39.867

should have realized...

34:51.840 --> 34:56.049
how complicated
his relationships would become
in our present culture.

about the pecan poop?

where he was killed...

to the cornfield.

Angela asked me
to take a look,
but something’s not right.

36:14.256 --> 36:18.795
Did she check the figures
pertaining to the bullet’s
angle and velocity?

36:18.886 --> 36:20.296
They’re accurate.

36:20.387 --> 36:23.254
And placing the assailant
directly over the victim...

36:23.349 --> 36:27.467
is consistent with the blowback
and the direction
of the beveling.

36:27.561 --> 36:31.019
True. But why wouldn’t
the victim get back up?

36:31.106 --> 36:33.768

have to do to subdue him?

No. We found no evidence
to support that theory.

was committed by one man.

In the simplest terms,

38:00.362 --> 38:03.069
the digested pecan particulate
we found in the blowback...

38:03.157 --> 38:06.115
is the result of intense
dehydration and compression,

38:06.201 --> 38:10.114
thanks to the unique
gizzard structure
of the common turkey.

38:10.205 --> 38:12.287

happened in Virginia—

in the area. And take a look.
