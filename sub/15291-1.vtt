To rescue the Grand Elder
of Invisible Tribe before dawn.

04:54.086 --> 04:57.254
Over the years, King ZHOU has
slaughtered numerous Adept tribes.

04:58.340 --> 05:00.257
It's said that he's bewitched by Daji.

05:01.051 --> 05:02.802
He's merely a puppet of that Nine-Tail Fox.

Only Master Jiang can wipe out
this ancient Fox Demon.

Now, our top priority is

05:13.605 --> 05:16.816
to find Invisible Tribe's Grand Elder
and bring him safely back to Xiqi.

05:17.275 --> 05:20.069
Since we crossed the Zhaoge border,
I can smell blood,

not to use your Adept power!

05:33.417 --> 05:35.626

The truth is, King ZHOU has a secret.

06:14.750 --> 06:16.292
In order to gain the world,

06:16.668 --> 06:20.296
he made a devilish deal with
Supreme Demon when he was young.

06:20.630 --> 06:22.006
DEMON: I can give you everything.

06:22.299 --> 06:23.299
Okay.

I will own the world.
I will be the one and only king!

06:42.736 --> 06:45.321
When the three suns converge,
and Black Dragon descends,

06:45.614 --> 06:48.574
great darkness will envelop the world.

06:51.328 --> 06:55.081
We will be left in this darkness
for 1 8,000 years.

06:55.332 --> 06:57.875
So Nine-Tail Fox isn't the biggest threat.

06:58.168 --> 07:01.087
Actually, it's this Black Dragon.

07:02.339 --> 07:03.339
Why involve Grand Elder?

07:03.590 --> 07:06.842
He's the only one that knows
the secret to killing Black Dragon.

His mystic eye is with us now.
What are we waiting for?

27:42.578 --> 27:44.871
People usually enjoy the full moon at night.

27:45.205 --> 27:47.248
But it's a double moon.

27:47.750 --> 27:50.043
You can only see them at sunset.

27:50.210 --> 27:52.754
How can we kill Black Dragon
with just an eyeball?

27:53.255 --> 27:57.133
An Invisible tribesman can see
the stars behind the sun.

27:57.426 --> 28:01.346
Grand Elder's eyes have stored
everything he has ever seen.

28:07.269 --> 28:10.438
He is the only one who has seen
Black Dragon's nemesis.

28:11.106 --> 28:13.024
Though it's just one eye,

28:13.525 --> 28:15.985
at least it gives us some insight.

28:29.083 --> 28:30.124
(COUGHING)

28:39.802 --> 28:41.469
-I am younger now.
-Huh?

28:43.972 --> 28:46.849
I was hit by Daji's Reverse-Aging Curse.

28:47.059 --> 28:49.727
The Curse accelerates
every time I exert my life energy.

28:50.396 --> 28:52.438
Would you like to try? Huh?

28:57.277 --> 28:58.277
Do I look handsome?

29:01.782 --> 29:05.201
But the price is, when my energy is used up,

29:05.536 --> 29:09.288
my primordial spirit will vanish.

29:10.749 --> 29:13.042
We are facing our doom.
How can you make jokes?

29:13.252 --> 29:14.335
Whoa, don't worry.

29:14.711 --> 29:18.798
Win or lose, alive or dead, he who laughs last

29:19.174 --> 29:20.383
will win the day.

29:24.847 --> 29:28.266
So it's the legendary Sword of Light?

29:39.862 --> 29:42.029
(GROWLING)

29:44.825 --> 29:46.242
The Sword of Light

29:46.577 --> 29:49.495

that can defeat Black Dragon.

29:50.122 --> 29:51.414
(SIGHS)

29:53.375 --> 29:57.086
Only Gold Dragon is capable
of mastering this Sword.

30:07.306 --> 30:09.307
The Sword has tremendous power.

30:09.516 --> 30:11.976
But its power can be destructive
if not controlled.

30:12.102 --> 30:16.022
That's right. It depends on the heart
of the person using the Sword.

30:16.273 --> 30:18.524
I just want the world to be at peace,

30:18.734 --> 30:21.527
not perish with King ZHOU.

30:21.653 --> 30:25.239
There can be fire on water
and rebirth from death.

30:26.617 --> 30:30.036
We all have been through hardship
because what we are doing

30:30.662 --> 30:34.415
is not just for ourselves,
but for the future of the world.

30:34.875 --> 30:37.877
I’ve prepared many years
for the war against King ZHOU.

30:38.045 --> 30:40.087
What Xiqi needs is to stick together,

30:40.380 --> 30:43.132
not gamble everyone's life on a sword.

30:43.342 --> 30:45.760
Well, it's not a gamble!

30:46.094 --> 30:48.429
I know you don't believe
in the Sword of Light.

30:48.597 --> 30:51.474
-You don't even believe in yourself.
-Don't I believe in you?

30:51.600 --> 30:54.852
Look at your face now. Soon, you'll be
young enough to call me uncle.

Oh, my God! Daji's tail can
reach us all the way over here?

01:33:24.474 --> 01:33:26.267
(GIGGLES)

01:33:27.894 --> 01:33:29.478
YOUNG JIANG:
Are you here to play with me?

01:33:33.525 --> 01:33:34.692
Come on!

01:33:34.901 --> 01:33:36.652
Come! Come on, now!

01:33:37.028 --> 01:33:38.195
Come!

01:33:38.363 --> 01:33:40.406
MAGIC GRASS: Silly boy. Just run!

01:33:46.955 --> 01:33:47.955
(GRUNTS)

01:33:52.085 --> 01:33:54.044
-(YELLING)
-(ROARING)

01:34:02.262 --> 01:34:04.388
Team Tornado, take the south side.

01:34:04.764 --> 01:34:06.598
Team Thunderbolt, defend the north side.

01:34:08.476 --> 01:34:09.476
(GASPS)

01:34:09.561 --> 01:34:11.228
(GROANS)

01:34:14.065 --> 01:34:15.441
Father Commander!

01:34:26.786 --> 01:34:28.287
(ROARS)

01:34:31.374 --> 01:34:32.374
Father.

01:34:36.713 --> 01:34:38.047
This is

01:34:39.007 --> 01:34:41.258
our last chance.

01:34:41.968 --> 01:34:43.260
Carry the Sword

01:34:45.889 --> 01:34:48.140
to the Spring of Life.

01:34:48.767 --> 01:34:51.101
Let light return.

01:34:55.231 --> 01:34:58.901
I’ll entrust the safety of Xiqi with you.

01:35:01.196 --> 01:35:02.988
Xiqi!

01:35:04.824 --> 01:35:05.908
Invincible!

01:35:18.838 --> 01:35:20.422
(YELLING)

01:35:21.132 --> 01:35:22.800
Brother, get going!

01:35:23.927 --> 01:35:25.803
Take it to the Spring of Life!

01:35:27.722 --> 01:35:29.014
(GRUNTS)

01:35:29.140 --> 01:35:33.060

01:35:37.774 --> 01:35:39.525
(MONSTER ROARING)

01:35:43.029 --> 01:35:44.071
Master Jiang.

01:35:44.656 --> 01:35:45.781
Where's Master Jiang?

01:35:45.990 --> 01:35:49.451
Jiang was caught by Daji's tail!

01:36:20.108 --> 01:36:24.820
(GROWLING)

01:36:44.424 --> 01:37:00.898

01:37:07.864 --> 01:37:18.165
(YELLS)

01:37:40.396 --> 01:37:41.563
The real Gold Dragon.

01:37:51.991 --> 01:37:53.659
(CHUCKLES)

01:38:04.045 --> 01:38:05.963
We've got the Sword of Light.

01:38:06.172 --> 01:38:07.798
Let's kill Black Dragon now.

01:38:09.300 --> 01:38:10.467
No need to hurry.

01:38:11.386 --> 01:38:13.262
It's all just as Master Jiang predicted.

01:38:15.682 --> 01:38:16.682
Xiqi!

01:38:17.225 --> 01:38:18.559
SOLDIERS: Invincible!

01:38:23.314 --> 01:38:24.982
MAN: We'll storm Zhaoge!

01:38:36.160 --> 01:38:38.161
(MUSIC PLAYING)

01:40:33.945 --> 01:40:35.112
Jiang...

01:40:35.279 --> 01:40:38.365
(BABY CRYING)

01:40:42.745 --> 01:40:45.122
You don't have the Sword of Light

01:40:46.290 --> 01:40:48.458
while I’m protected by Black Dragon.

01:40:49.669 --> 01:40:51.336
Killing the Dragon with a sword?

01:40:51.629 --> 01:40:53.338
That's preposterous!

01:40:55.133 --> 01:40:57.426
(LAUGHING)

01:41:01.431 --> 01:41:03.807
