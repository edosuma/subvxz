01:07.533 --> 01:09.135
[whimpering]

01:09.168 --> 01:10.636
Tell me!

01:10.669 --> 01:12.505
[screaming]

01:12.538 --> 01:14.107
- Where are they?
- No!

[groaning]

01:15.841 --> 01:17.577
Jesse: Hey, leave her alone.

01:17.610 --> 01:20.313
She doesn't know anything.

01:20.346 --> 01:21.648
String him up!

01:26.619 --> 01:29.188
- No, no.
- Okay, American.

01:29.221 --> 01:31.091
Now you will tell me.

01:35.928 --> 01:37.263
[screaming]

01:37.296 --> 01:39.132
Where are they?

01:39.165 --> 01:40.166
[screaming]

01:40.199 --> 01:42.568
Where is your unit heading?

01:42.601 --> 01:46.506
[breathing heavily] Go kiss.

01:46.539 --> 01:47.673
What did he say?

01:47.706 --> 01:50.276
[breathing heavily]

01:50.309 --> 01:52.311
- Go kiss.
- Go kiss? What is Go kiss?

01:52.344 --> 01:54.180
Go kiss.

01:54.213 --> 01:56.382
Go kiss my ass.

01:56.415 --> 01:59.352
[groaning]

02:02.188 --> 02:03.356
What are you doing?

02:03.389 --> 02:05.258
I am getting the information
we need!

02:05.291 --> 02:07.426
You killed him before we got
the information! No matter.

02:07.459 --> 02:09.228
We got two left!
Do not question me!

02:09.261 --> 02:10.329
I know what I am doing!

02:43.429 --> 02:45.231
How'd you get free?

02:45.264 --> 02:47.800
Let's just say those
Cross-fit classes paid off.

[indistinct chatter]

02:49.702 --> 02:51.771
[laughing]

02:53.939 --> 02:55.675

No time to defuse it. Go! Go!

[gasping]

03:19.265 --> 03:20.466
[clearing throat]

03:20.499 --> 03:22.535
- Mara?
- Mm-hmm.

03:22.568 --> 03:25.004
[sighing] Please knock first.

03:25.037 --> 03:26.539
Come on. We can't be late.

03:26.572 --> 03:28.641
I wanna go on the first patrol
with you.

03:28.674 --> 03:30.910
- You sure you're up to this?
- Of course.

03:30.943 --> 03:32.578
I've been counting down
all week.

03:32.611 --> 03:34.614
I was talking to your father.

03:34.647 --> 03:37.583
[sighs] I've survived worse.
I think I can handle this.

03:37.616 --> 03:39.852
[chuckling]
Where's your brother?

03:39.885 --> 03:43.789
In bed, playing on his pad
like he doesn't wanna go.

03:43.822 --> 03:47.026
Mara, can you give your father
and me just a few minutes alone

03:47.059 --> 03:48.861
for some morning grown-up talk?

03:48.894 --> 03:51.731
Ew! So gross.

03:52.798 --> 03:54.634
- Uh, babe.
- Hm?

03:54.667 --> 03:55.935
Morning grown-up talk?

03:55.968 --> 03:58.404
I think she even
saw through that one.

03:58.437 --> 03:59.639
No.

04:00.806 --> 04:02.742
I actually wanna talk.

04:02.775 --> 04:05.978
Okay.

04:06.011 --> 04:10.016
Ever since you started this
new job, you're hardly around.

04:10.049 --> 04:13.686
Look, babe, I gotta work, right?
We got bills to pay.

04:13.719 --> 04:16.822
I'm just saying, you missed
his last three ball games.

04:16.855 --> 04:20.358
[scoffs] And she just
finally got her scouts badge.

04:20.392 --> 04:21.994
What happened to family first?

04:22.027 --> 04:24.597
Well, that's why I'm bringing
them to work with me today,

04:24.630 --> 04:26.866
so we can have some quality
family time, right?

04:26.899 --> 04:28.968
- All you do is work.
- And, baby.

04:29.001 --> 04:30.936
You know what I've been
going through, readjusting

04:30.969 --> 04:33.606
to civilian life,
struggling to pay these bills.

04:33.639 --> 04:37.443
And now I'm finally feeling like
the provider again.

04:37.476 --> 04:39.812
We miss you.

04:39.845 --> 04:42.048
And we need you.

04:42.081 --> 04:44.884
Ah-hah. "We."

04:44.917 --> 04:48.621
[laughing] Me.

04:49.722 --> 04:51.891
- I hear you.
- Yeah.

04:51.924 --> 04:54.861
[instrumental music]

04:58.664 --> 05:00.966
- I'm gonna get them dressed.
- Mm-hmm.

05:00.999 --> 05:02.735
And I'm going to make them
some breakfast

05:02.768 --> 05:04.437
for their busy day
with their daddy.

05:04.470 --> 05:05.471
You better get goin'.

05:05.504 --> 05:06.872
[laughing]

05:06.905 --> 05:07.874
Mm.

05:11.710 --> 05:12.679
Mm.

05:21.520 --> 05:23.589
Mara: Mom, are you watching?

05:23.622 --> 05:25.591
Mara, I'm watching,
I'm also working

05:25.624 --> 05:26.959
on not burning breakfast.

05:26.992 --> 05:28.427
Watching what?

05:28.460 --> 05:29.662
I was just trying to show mom

05:29.695 --> 05:30.996
the flying back kick
you taught me.

05:31.029 --> 05:33.766
Jesse: Okay. Let's see it.
Let's see it.

05:33.799 --> 05:36.435
Okay, now remember,
when you jump and land,

05:36.468 --> 05:37.803
that's when you extend your leg.

05:37.836 --> 05:40.406
Maybe she should extend her lip
over her face.

05:40.439 --> 05:42.975
- That's it. I'mma kick ya ass.
- Uh, Mara.

05:43.008 --> 05:45.911
This is what I have to deal with
all day while you're at work.

05:45.944 --> 05:49.548
Ry, what'd I tell you about
teasing your little sister, huh?

05:49.581 --> 05:51.384
- Apologize.
- Why?

05:51.417 --> 05:53.552
You're not even here for some
of the things she calls me.

05:53.585 --> 05:55.654
Hey. Watch that tone, young man.

05:55.687 --> 05:57.690
- And show some respect.
- It's okay, babe.

05:57.723 --> 06:00.893
His little pre-teen hormones
are kicking in.

06:00.926 --> 06:02.461
- Give me that.
- Hey!

06:02.494 --> 06:05.064
No, we're gonna sit down
and have breakfast

06:05.097 --> 06:07.800
and talk like a regular family.

06:07.833 --> 06:09.001
Let's scarf and go!

06:09.034 --> 06:11.837
Walking around the arena
all day?

06:11.870 --> 06:14.740
- Sounds wack.
- So you don't wanna go?

06:14.773 --> 06:16.108
No. Not really.

06:16.141 --> 06:19.044
Okay then, well, Mara and I

06:19.077 --> 06:22.181
will just enjoy the Falcons'
game by ourselves.

06:22.214 --> 06:23.616
Whoo-hoo!

06:23.649 --> 06:25.584
The Phoenix Falcons'
season opener?

06:25.617 --> 06:27.052
My favorite player, Micah Crews,

06:27.085 --> 06:29.054
just got traded
to the Phoenix Falcons.

06:29.087 --> 06:31.491
Too bad you don't wanna go. Hm.

06:33.025 --> 06:35.194
What? Change your mind?

06:35.227 --> 06:37.129
Who cares about the stupid game.

06:37.162 --> 06:39.198
Mara: I just wanna go on patrol
with you.

06:39.231 --> 06:41.734
Oh, well, I'm gonna have to play
that one by ear, baby girl.

06:41.767 --> 06:44.470
Uh, now, I'm still learning
my way around the job myself.

06:44.503 --> 06:47.640
- I guess it'll still be fun.
- What are we waiting for?

06:47.673 --> 06:49.942
Let's go!

06:49.975 --> 06:52.077
Ryan: I can't wait to see
Micah Crews in action.

06:52.110 --> 06:54.713
I can't wait to see you
in action, daddy!

06:54.746 --> 06:57.583
Probably not gonna be too much
action for me, sweetie.

06:57.616 --> 06:59.619
This is just a regular day
at the office.

07:01.820 --> 07:05.224
Hey, Freeman, these can't be
your kids. They're adorable.

07:05.257 --> 07:06.792
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

07:06.825 --> 07:09.028
Man 2: Hey, Jesse, what's up?
- How you doin'?

07:09.061 --> 07:11.797
Daddy, is it always busy
like this?

07:11.830 --> 07:14.500
Well, it all depends
on who's in the venue.

07:14.533 --> 07:16.535
Well, today is a special day,
not only because

07:16.568 --> 07:19.939
it's the Falcons' season opener,
but the governor and the mayor

07:19.972 --> 07:22.508
are comin' to watch the game
with the new stadium owner.

07:22.541 --> 07:24.777
- Guess who.
- Who?

07:24.810 --> 07:27.947
- Diana Smart.
- OMG, Diana Smart?

07:27.980 --> 07:30.115
When I grow up,
I wanna be a genius billionaire

07:30.148 --> 07:31.217
just like her.

07:31.250 --> 07:32.751
Yeah, dream on.

07:32.784 --> 07:34.653
- Hater.
- Stop.

07:34.686 --> 07:36.489
Why is the arena
all thrashed out like that?

07:36.522 --> 07:38.123
Ms. Smart is doing renovations.

07:38.156 --> 07:40.659
Daddy, can we please meet her?

07:40.692 --> 07:42.995
Oh, sweetie,
she is a very busy lady.

07:43.028 --> 07:45.965
- I doubt we'll even see her.
- Okay.

07:47.866 --> 07:50.803
[indistinct chatter]

07:57.676 --> 07:59.912
Man 3: Yo, we have to bring out
the big boy.

07:59.945 --> 08:03.483
Check my lady out,
killin' it, as usual.

08:05.284 --> 08:08.787
Yeah, and so we checkin' out
the spot where she's the owner

08:08.820 --> 08:10.623
doin' her thing, you know?

08:10.656 --> 08:13.225
Damn, girl, we like the new Jay
and Beyonce up in this piece.

08:13.258 --> 08:15.761
Woman 2: We love you, Diane!
We love you, Milli!

08:15.794 --> 08:17.196
Oh, we love you, too, baby.

08:17.229 --> 08:19.064
Give me
a complete digital sweep.

08:19.097 --> 08:20.233
Yes, sir.

08:30.842 --> 08:31.811
[sighing]

08:33.312 --> 08:34.880
Thompson: Thompson here.
Vendor key.

08:34.913 --> 08:37.883
I'm having Wi-Fi problems
with system 12-B.

08:37.916 --> 08:41.053
The IT team I requested
should be coming your way soon.

08:41.086 --> 08:42.655
I'll let you know
when they arrive.

08:42.688 --> 08:44.757
Devlin: Copy that.
- Right this way.

08:44.790 --> 08:46.992
- Our seats are right...
- Hey, what's up, tight shirt?

08:47.025 --> 08:49.862
- Oh.
- Good-lookin' kids right there.

08:49.895 --> 08:53.098
- Sure they're yours?
Jesse: Guys, this is Gus.

08:53.131 --> 08:55.568
He's the, uh,
maintenance engineer.

08:55.601 --> 08:58.103
So he's a janitor?

08:58.136 --> 09:00.239
Hey, I got an important job
for you two today.

09:00.272 --> 09:02.107
Stay real close to your dad.

09:02.140 --> 09:04.176
Now he only gets lost,
like, once a day now.

09:04.209 --> 09:07.012
You get lost? What a noob.

09:07.045 --> 09:09.748
I wish my dad would've taken me
to work when I was your age.

09:09.781 --> 09:12.051
But I never knew him.

09:15.053 --> 09:16.756
Alright guys, let's go.

09:20.926 --> 09:23.195
And this is the security office.

09:23.228 --> 09:26.365
- Wow.
- Wow.

09:26.398 --> 09:29.068
Got some good-lookin' kids
there, Freeman. Are they yours?

09:29.101 --> 09:32.104
[laughing] Why is everybody
so amazed

09:32.137 --> 09:35.140
that I have good-lookin' kids?
I mean, what am I, a troll?

09:35.173 --> 09:37.710
Dad, where's your gun?

09:37.743 --> 09:40.946
Guns don't make you safe, son.
Strategy does.

09:40.979 --> 09:42.281
- Thank you, sir.
- You're welcome.

09:42.314 --> 09:44.283
This is head of security,
Devlin Montez.

09:44.316 --> 09:46.385
He's my boss.

09:46.418 --> 09:48.053
All my guards are given
state-of-the-art

09:48.086 --> 09:50.189
security tablets
to communicate with each other,

09:50.222 --> 09:52.858
and to track down any security
problems here in the arena.

09:52.891 --> 09:55.260
The arena has the most
sophisticated weapons detectors

09:55.293 --> 09:56.962
in the world.

09:56.995 --> 09:59.164
No one could get on to the lot
with a small handgun

09:59.197 --> 10:00.232
and not be detected.

10:00.265 --> 10:03.069
So no gun, huh?

10:04.336 --> 10:06.338
Lame.

10:06.371 --> 10:08.907
[laughing]

10:08.940 --> 10:10.643
Get your family situated.

10:10.676 --> 10:12.878
I'm gonna need all the guards
on duty on first patrol.

10:12.911 --> 10:14.313
Our VIPs
are already in the building.

10:14.346 --> 10:15.748
Yes, sir.

10:17.816 --> 10:19.985
Now...

10:20.018 --> 10:24.223
you guys are VIPs.

10:25.891 --> 10:28.661
- Cool. Jinx!
- Cool. Jinx!

10:28.694 --> 10:31.397
Now, do not take those off as
long as you're in this building.

10:31.430 --> 10:33.666
- You understand?
- Mm-hmm.

10:33.699 --> 10:35.367
You and your hormones
understand?

10:35.400 --> 10:38.303
Can we go now?
I'm not trying to miss tip-off.

10:38.336 --> 10:39.739
[door clanking]

10:54.019 --> 10:56.756
[van doors opening]

11:05.864 --> 11:09.001
Hey. We're here to fix
the arena Wi-Fi.

11:09.034 --> 11:11.737
Wow. It's a lot of you
for one job.

11:11.770 --> 11:14.039
You ever try to bounce
a digital signal around 950,000

11:14.072 --> 11:17.276
square feet of total space
with a seamless signal?

11:17.309 --> 11:19.144
It's not
a two-man configuration.

11:19.177 --> 11:21.447
Whatever.
That's above my pay-grade, pal.

11:22.981 --> 11:25.284
We got the Wi-Fi tech crew here.

11:25.317 --> 11:27.453
Devlin: Send 'em up.
- Copy that.

11:30.822 --> 11:32.991
Announcer: Welcome to the arena,
sports fans!

11:33.024 --> 11:34.359
And we got a packed house

11:34.392 --> 11:37.730
just rarin' to see an exciting
basketball game.

11:37.763 --> 11:40.899
And we got
new Phoenix Falcons superstar,

11:40.932 --> 11:43.068
Micah Crews, in the building.

11:43.101 --> 11:46.271
How does it feel to be playing
on a new team this season?

11:46.304 --> 11:50.008
Your seats are right here.

11:50.041 --> 11:54.113
You didn't get us floor seats?
These seats are wack.

11:54.146 --> 11:56.315
Well, how about
you sit your little wack ass

11:56.348 --> 11:57.983
back in the car if you like?

11:58.016 --> 12:00.052
- I guess these will do.
Man 4: You know what, dude?

12:00.085 --> 12:02.421
Man 4: Why don't you shut up?
- So I will be back--

12:02.454 --> 12:04.256
I'm getting tired
of hearing this.

12:04.289 --> 12:06.358
- I'm trying to enjoy a game.
- Hey, hey, hey!

12:06.391 --> 12:08.861
- Can you stop? Please, stop.
- You guys break it up.

12:08.894 --> 12:10.996
- Take your seats.
- What're you gonna do about it?

12:11.029 --> 12:12.965
I'm warning you, do not put
your hands on me, sir.

12:12.998 --> 12:16.068
- Sit down.
- Kick rocks, rent-a-cop.

12:16.101 --> 12:18.170
- Okay, you're coming with me.
- You mother...

12:18.203 --> 12:19.538
- Oh!
- You're coming with me, too.

12:19.571 --> 12:21.507
- Let's go.
- Come on, man.

12:21.540 --> 12:24.843
You two, stay put. Ryan's
in charge till I get back.

12:24.876 --> 12:27.112
- But, daddy...
- Stay put.

12:27.145 --> 12:29.381
- Come on.
- Come on, dude.

12:29.414 --> 12:32.451
- He started this.
- That's my daddy!

12:32.484 --> 12:35.053
Oh, snap. Man,
the governor pullin' up on us.

12:35.086 --> 12:36.855
- We run this town, boy.
- Hi.

12:36.888 --> 12:40.392
It is such a pleasure
to see you again, Ms. Smart.

12:40.425 --> 12:43.562
- Oh. Thank you.
- You look absolutely stunning.

12:43.595 --> 12:45.430
I told her that same thing
in the limo.

12:45.463 --> 12:47.032
Your bodyguard
is very observant.

12:47.065 --> 12:49.968
Oh, snap. Did he just call me
the bodyguard?

12:50.001 --> 12:52.237
You know, I think what the, uh,
what the governor here was

12:52.270 --> 12:54.439
trying to say is just that
we're forever grateful to you,

12:54.472 --> 12:56.975
Diana, for taking your success

12:57.008 --> 12:59.011
and investing it back
into our city.

12:59.044 --> 13:01.313
Well, of course, mayor.
I was born and raised here.

13:01.346 --> 13:03.448
I grew up coming to the arena
as a kid with my daddy,

13:03.481 --> 13:05.083
to watch the hockey games.

13:05.116 --> 13:07.219
It was my dream of one day
being able to give back.

13:07.252 --> 13:09.188
You're also making us look good
for re-election.

13:09.221 --> 13:12.858
[sighs] Just remember
why we're here, governor.

13:12.891 --> 13:15.060
Don't forget who you work for.
The people.

13:15.093 --> 13:16.929
Don't forget about the 'hood,
either.

13:16.962 --> 13:20.532
Oh, of course, of course.
People first. Always.

13:20.565 --> 13:22.501
Love the 'hood.

13:22.534 --> 13:24.536
Um, shall we head
to the owner's suite?

13:24.569 --> 13:26.038
I've got a few surprises
for everyone.

13:26.071 --> 13:28.207
- Good idea.
- Great.

Yeah.

19:21.859 --> 19:23.628
Yeah, that was cool.

19:23.661 --> 19:24.896
I hate to admit it
'cause I'm more of

19:24.929 --> 19:28.667
a old-fashioned rock music
kinda guy.

19:28.700 --> 19:32.837
In fact, I hate hip-hop.

we can do for you?

19:35.306 --> 19:38.743
Uh, first of all, that's, uh...

19:38.776 --> 19:40.746
I have a small confession
to make.

19:43.314 --> 19:45.517
We're not really
security guards.

19:48.419 --> 19:49.487
Look, I'm just here to collect.

members of my team there,

19:59.797 --> 20:02.201

20:04.369 --> 20:05.904
That makes me the alpha.

20:05.937 --> 20:07.505
Milli: Yo, I know what this is.

20:07.538 --> 20:10.275
This is one of those

20:10.308 --> 20:12.510

You in on this?

20:12.543 --> 20:14.379
Now, is he with you?

20:14.412 --> 20:17.315
Are you guys, like, some kind
of like, uh, thing, Ms. Smart?

20:17.348 --> 20:19.584
Or can I call you Diana?
Can I call you Diana?

20:19.617 --> 20:21.853
Diana it is.
Alright, here's the thing.

20:21.886 --> 20:23.622
I'm only here for one reason
and one reason only.

20:23.655 --> 20:25.423
Actually, uh, I lied.

Uh, one billion reasons

20:29.694 --> 20:32.530

20:32.563 --> 20:34.933
I am the governor of this state.

20:34.966 --> 20:36.701
And on behalf
of the United States government,

20:36.734 --> 20:39.037
you are in a no-win situation.

20:39.070 --> 20:42.841

No, tell me you're joking.
You're not joking?

21:31.022 --> 21:32.590
Take care of us?

21:36.627 --> 21:38.830
Daddy's not a loser.

He ain't a superstar
like Micah Crews.

Yeah, that's who I wish
was my real daddy.

- Get her!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

22:43.861 --> 22:45.864
[grunting]

22:47.432 --> 22:48.566
What do you wanna do
with her now?

22:48.599 --> 22:50.402
What do you think?
Get rid of her.

22:50.435 --> 22:52.871
I ain't killing no kids, man.
I didn't sign up for this shit.

22:52.904 --> 22:55.907
Let's take her to Alpha.
Let him deal with it.

22:55.940 --> 22:57.008
Hey!

22:57.041 --> 22:58.744
[squealing]

23:01.813 --> 23:03.748
Another one of you's gonna die
in the next quarter

23:03.781 --> 23:05.183
if my demands aren't met.

23:05.216 --> 23:07.152
How am I supposed to send you
one billion?

23:07.185 --> 23:08.953
I can't just pull up
my banking app for that.

23:08.986 --> 23:11.456
Oh, come on, Diana.

23:11.489 --> 23:14.025
You're not the only
tech-savvy one in this room.

23:14.058 --> 23:15.693
You will enter routing numbers,

23:15.726 --> 23:19.798
bank accounts
and PIN numbers into this.

23:19.831 --> 23:22.200
Once you get past the firewall,
we will begin to transfer

23:22.233 --> 23:24.135
the Digi-Coin into our cloud.

23:24.168 --> 23:26.971
Block-chain tech. Clever.

23:27.004 --> 23:29.641
Oh.

23:29.674 --> 23:31.142
Now, is that a compliment
coming from you?

23:31.175 --> 23:33.044
You can jump out
the suite window.

23:33.077 --> 23:35.880
Babe, what is it...
Don't piss the man off.

23:35.913 --> 23:38.683
Yeah, babe, why don't you listen
to your dipshit boyfriend here?

23:38.716 --> 23:41.186
Now, if I can bring
your attention this way,

23:41.219 --> 23:42.687
this little lady can hack into

23:42.720 --> 23:44.589
the entire
Odyssey communications grid.

23:44.622 --> 23:46.024
Isn't that right?

23:46.057 --> 23:47.826
Remember what I did
to that airport in Haiti?

23:47.859 --> 23:50.728
Oh, yes, I do. Do it.

23:50.761 --> 23:51.830
[chuckles]

24:01.205 --> 24:02.541
Beta?

24:04.141 --> 24:05.944
Why don't you cut me
some slices?

24:10.848 --> 24:12.951
What you gonna do with that?
Oh, God! No, no, no!

24:12.984 --> 24:14.953
Hey, come on, man,
I'm too pretty to slice!

24:14.986 --> 24:16.754
Look, I still gotta record
"The Booty Clap" video, man.

24:16.787 --> 24:18.590
You know what it is, man.
I, I can't be looking like...

24:18.623 --> 24:20.892
- How come he looking crazy--
- Relax, R and B.

24:23.294 --> 24:24.896
Gamma.

24:26.931 --> 24:28.667
Joe: Are you in play?

24:31.602 --> 24:36.007
I'm in the game. Communication
scrambler attached.

24:36.040 --> 24:37.175
Alright.

24:45.783 --> 24:48.620

24:49.687 --> 24:50.889
Falcons!

24:50.922 --> 24:53.758
[crowd cheering]

24:53.791 --> 24:56.728
- Ryan, where's your sister?
- I don't know.

24:56.761 --> 24:58.096
What-- what do you mean,
"I don't know?"

24:58.129 --> 24:59.864
I-- I know I left you in charge.

24:59.897 --> 25:01.733
She said she had to go pee.

25:01.766 --> 25:03.868
Son, you had one job.

25:03.901 --> 25:06.838
What was I supposed to do, make
her sit here and pee on herself?

25:06.871 --> 25:08.640
You're supposed to go with...

25:08.673 --> 25:10.642
Did she have
her security badge on her?

25:16.747 --> 25:19.150
My wife is gonna kill me.

25:19.183 --> 25:22.587
Sir, we've lost connection
to all security tablets.

25:51.182 --> 25:53.585
What is... Let me see this.

25:53.618 --> 25:55.219
Damn, this is a VIP badge.

25:55.252 --> 25:57.221
- Encoded footprint.
- Ah, shit.

25:57.254 --> 25:59.023
She's being tracked by security.

25:59.056 --> 26:00.592
She must belong
to somebody important.

26:00.625 --> 26:01.926
Yeah, but we took out
all the security.

26:01.959 --> 26:04.028
Obviously not.
Hurry up, take this.

26:04.061 --> 26:05.229
You take him out. I got her.

26:05.262 --> 26:07.031
Come on, let's go.
Come on, move.

26:07.064 --> 26:08.733
- Let me go!
- Copy that.

26:08.766 --> 26:11.303
- Mara?
Mara: Daddy!

Where are you going, Mara?

26:31.222 --> 26:32.691
Mara?

26:36.661 --> 26:39.297

26:57.882 --> 27:00.652
[breathing heavily] Where's who?

27:00.685 --> 27:03.721
This badge belonged
to a little girl. Where is she?

27:03.754 --> 27:05.857
I don't know anything
about a little girl, man.

27:05.890 --> 27:08.159
Oh, you think I'm playing, huh?

27:08.192 --> 27:10.428
Does it look like
I'm playing now?

in the stadium.

29:21.392 --> 29:23.294

You got something you wanna say
to me, Ms. Smart?

29:46.417 --> 29:47.986
I know you.

29:50.921 --> 29:54.091
Jobe. Jobe Davis.

29:54.124 --> 29:56.194
Ex-CIA, counterterrorism agent.

29:56.227 --> 29:58.529
Well, holy shit.

29:58.562 --> 30:00.398
I'm starting to understand
what this is all about.

30:00.431 --> 30:02.433
What this about? This is about
what you did to me.

30:02.466 --> 30:05.269
What you did to my team.
That's what this is about.

30:05.302 --> 30:07.138
Okay, excuse me, mister, I...

All that I'm trying to say is,
whatever she did,

30:09.974 --> 30:12.476
I'm gonna be the first
to apologize for her.

30:12.509 --> 30:14.445
What in the hell
did you do to this dude?

30:14.478 --> 30:17.081
Jobe Davis mistook
an innocent American family

30:17.114 --> 30:20.284
for a Muslim terrorist cell
and killed them.

30:20.317 --> 30:23.354
A mother and father
with two kids, six and eight.

30:23.387 --> 30:25.389
I hired a team of attorneys
to uncover the truth.

30:25.422 --> 30:27.592
They discovered
that Mr. Davis was responsible

30:27.625 --> 30:29.427
during an illegal raid
on their home.

30:29.460 --> 30:31.028
Everybody makes a mistake
on the job.

30:31.061 --> 30:34.899
A mistake? That family is dead
because of you!

30:34.932 --> 30:36.968
Which resulted
in the destruction of my life,

30:37.001 --> 30:38.603

30:38.636 --> 30:41.105
and destroying the lives
of my team.

normally.

It's like the John McClane shit.

31:53.344 --> 31:55.446
- What?
- "Die Hard."

31:55.479 --> 31:58.249
You never seen "Die Hard?"
Bruce Willis?

31:58.282 --> 32:00.551
Like, all these terrorists, they
took over this Nakatomi Building

32:00.584 --> 32:02.420
and he's like "Yipee ki-yay,
motherfucker!"

32:02.453 --> 32:04.021

I'm talking about
real life here.

32:10.127 --> 32:11.996
Could you just please show me

32:12.029 --> 32:15.266
a safe route out of here
so I can find my daughter?

32:15.299 --> 32:17.034
We can take the east hallway.

32:17.067 --> 32:18.569
Uh, that's the quickest way
we'll get to 'em and it--

32:18.602 --> 32:20.304
it's always empty
during game time.

32:20.337 --> 32:22.073
- Come on.
- Thanks.

Sorry about your pens.

32:36.020 --> 32:37.989
I don't have time for this shit.

33:16.226 --> 33:18.496
I'm only gonna tell you
this one time.

33:20.431 --> 33:24.302
You do that again,
and I'mma cut you in pieces.

33:28.272 --> 33:29.273
Go!

33:32.776 --> 33:34.045

33:34.078 --> 33:35.613

Excuse me.

33:40.284 --> 33:42.587
Oh. Hey there.

33:44.588 --> 33:48.359
- Where's your badge?
- It's my first day on the job.

33:48.392 --> 33:50.661
And where's your security pad?

33:50.694 --> 33:53.330
Oh, must've left it
in the break room.

33:53.363 --> 33:56.600

Ah-ah-ah...
You got the last one.

So you're tellin' me

35:03.767 --> 35:05.336
Just tell me
where my daughter is.

35:05.369 --> 35:07.404
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

35:07.437 --> 35:08.873
Who are you with?

35:08.906 --> 35:11.843
[laughing]

35:13.911 --> 35:15.680
It's too late.

35:17.381 --> 35:20.451
The clock is ticking,
and you can't stop it.

35:20.484 --> 35:23.454
[groaning]

35:23.487 --> 35:25.856
- Gus, get her earpiece.
- Uh-unh!

35:25.889 --> 35:27.758
She already kicked me once.

35:27.791 --> 35:29.260
Hold this.

35:29.293 --> 35:30.794
- Ah!
- Unh!

35:30.827 --> 35:33.164

[gunshot]

35:46.577 --> 35:50.214
Yo, that is one crazy bitch!

35:53.483 --> 35:54.752
Now let's look at this bomb.

35:54.785 --> 35:56.287
Gus: Bomb?

35:58.989 --> 36:00.758
Holy shit!

36:00.791 --> 36:03.194
This is a Ping-Pong bomb.

36:03.227 --> 36:06.397
Activated via remote,
or motion-sensitive.

36:06.430 --> 36:08.499
These are designed
for maximum collateral damage

36:08.532 --> 36:10.968
in close basis,
or for troops in one place.

36:11.001 --> 36:13.804
Or like a large crowd
leaving an arena.

36:13.837 --> 36:15.539
You sure you know
what you're doing?

36:15.572 --> 36:17.775
- Can you back up a little bit?
- Sorry.

36:19.543 --> 36:23.514
And... disarmed.

36:25.582 --> 36:28.552
Just one of these has
the potential to kill hundreds.

36:28.585 --> 36:29.820
I say we get your son
out of here,

36:29.853 --> 36:31.322
get him safe, call the cavalry.

36:31.355 --> 36:32.623
I'll be very honest with you.

36:32.656 --> 36:33.791
I'm not getting paid enough
for this.

36:33.824 --> 36:35.492
No, I'm not gonna send my son

36:35.525 --> 36:37.861
through exits
rigged with explosives.

36:37.894 --> 36:39.964
There could be more of these,
like, at every exit.

36:39.997 --> 36:42.466
There's, like, a dozen
main exits in this arena.

36:42.499 --> 36:44.735
You heard what she said, right?

36:44.768 --> 36:47.538
The clock is ticking. I have
to do something to stop this.

36:47.571 --> 36:50.708
Besides, my daughter
is still in this place.

36:50.741 --> 36:52.276
It's gonna be suicide, man.

36:52.309 --> 36:53.978
Well, then I'll commit it
saving lives.

36:54.011 --> 36:56.914
You can't save everyone
by yourself.

36:56.947 --> 36:58.549
You're right.

36:58.582 --> 37:01.953
But maybe with your help?

37:04.321 --> 37:06.324
Hell, no!

37:13.397 --> 37:15.799
The entire arena layout.

37:15.832 --> 37:18.302
Look, all the exits,
right there.

37:18.335 --> 37:21.272
Yeah. They're the most logical
places to plant a bomb.

37:21.305 --> 37:23.007
So we'll start there.

37:23.040 --> 37:24.942
We also need a solid way
to communicate,

37:24.975 --> 37:26.010
should we get split up.

37:26.043 --> 37:29.780
Ooh! Analog, baby!

37:29.813 --> 37:33.617
They'll never hear us on these
frequencies. There you go.

37:33.650 --> 37:35.753
Well, we got
a lot of ground to cover,

37:35.786 --> 37:37.855
and time is not on our side.

37:39.456 --> 37:41.825
My girl Bessie'll help.

37:41.858 --> 37:42.960
Who?

37:45.862 --> 37:48.799
Tight shirt, meet Bessie.

37:48.832 --> 37:51.635
Go, Bessie. [grunts]

37:51.668 --> 37:52.937
Fuck, yeah.

37:54.805 --> 37:57.742
[crowd cheering]

38:08.518 --> 38:11.689
Diana didn't have anything
to do with your mistake.

38:11.722 --> 38:14.458
Mayor, you're really
starting to piss me off.

38:16.526 --> 38:17.662
Sit.

38:19.930 --> 38:21.865
You know,
someone like Diana Smart there,

38:21.898 --> 38:24.835
who has money,
they play both sides,

38:24.868 --> 38:26.470
judge and jury.

38:26.503 --> 38:28.672
You don't know
how dangerous my job was,

38:28.705 --> 38:32.609
how many innocent people
I protected. I protected.

38:32.642 --> 38:35.346
How many years
I served my country

38:35.379 --> 38:37.014
and how quickly
she took it away.

38:37.047 --> 38:39.817
Look, I'm sorry
you lost your family,

38:39.850 --> 38:42.486
but they're alive,
the Faakhirs are not.

38:42.519 --> 38:45.656
You're damn right you're sorry.

38:45.689 --> 38:47.591
And that's why you're gonna pay.

38:47.624 --> 38:49.427
Anything hit the account?

38:51.061 --> 38:53.097
[sighs] Nothing yet.

38:54.931 --> 38:56.900
Hey, please don't kill me!

38:56.933 --> 38:59.069
Look, I just started working
on my second album, man.

38:59.102 --> 39:01.538
- Kill her, kill her!
- Just give him the loot!

39:01.571 --> 39:02.906
Listen to R and B here.

39:02.939 --> 39:04.875
Virtual currency transfers

39:04.908 --> 39:08.779
- Please be patient.
- Stop playing me, Ms. Smart.

39:08.812 --> 39:10.447
You keep playing me,
I'm gonna kill you,

39:10.480 --> 39:11.682
I'm gonna kill the mayor, here,

39:11.715 --> 39:13.016
I'm gonna kill
your dumbass boyfriend.

39:13.049 --> 39:14.585
- [groans] Shit!
- Alright?

39:14.618 --> 39:17.021
I'm gonna kill everybody
in this goddamn arena.

39:22.592 --> 39:24.661
Get up.

39:24.694 --> 39:25.896
Come over here.

39:27.664 --> 39:28.799
Come here.

39:33.203 --> 39:34.605
Turn around.

39:40.644 --> 39:42.613
It's your turn.

39:42.646 --> 39:44.815
[gasps]

39:44.848 --> 39:47.484
You're gonna choose...

39:47.517 --> 39:49.153
- Who dies next.
- No.

39:49.186 --> 39:51.722
Yes. Is it gonna be
the honorable mayor?

39:51.755 --> 39:53.791
[sobbing]

39:53.824 --> 39:55.692
Or your Booty Clap
R and B boyfriend?

39:55.725 --> 39:57.795
- You choose.
- Come on, man.

39:57.828 --> 40:01.031
- Who is it gonna be? Do it.
- Bae.

40:01.064 --> 40:03.100
Look, I know you're not gonna
let them kill me, right?

40:03.133 --> 40:05.436
My album's streaming top 100.

40:05.469 --> 40:07.571
Y'all know how hard it is
to do that?

40:07.604 --> 40:09.173
If anything,
you shoot the mayor, goddammit.

40:09.206 --> 40:12.042
She ain't even helping
the black community properly.

40:12.075 --> 40:13.444
Really?

40:13.477 --> 40:15.612
- Just calm down, Milli.
- Calm down?

40:15.645 --> 40:17.915
Bitch, I ain't tryin' to die.
Yo, no, don't, don't shoot me.

40:17.948 --> 40:19.583
- Man. Come on, man.
Psi: Wait, wait, wait!

40:19.616 --> 40:21.552
We have an incoming deposit.

40:25.188 --> 40:27.524

40:27.557 --> 40:30.093

[exhales sharply]

40:32.162 --> 40:34.832
It's not so easy to pick
who lives or dies, is it?

40:36.266 --> 40:38.202
Now go sit your ass down.

40:43.039 --> 40:44.175
What we got?

40:46.843 --> 40:49.146
Good. Let's check in with Gamma.

40:49.179 --> 40:52.082
Psi: Looks like Gamma's only got
one more bomb to activate.

40:52.115 --> 40:53.984
Who'd try to bomb
a basketball arena?

40:54.017 --> 40:56.086
There's kids, there's old women.

40:56.119 --> 40:57.921
That's not cool at all, man.

40:57.954 --> 40:59.656
Jobe: Gamma, where are we at
with the last bomb?

40:59.689 --> 41:00.758
Hello?

41:02.859 --> 41:03.894
Who's this?

41:03.927 --> 41:05.596
An arena security guard.

41:05.629 --> 41:07.130
Who's this?

41:07.163 --> 41:10.067
Jobe: What's your name?
- Let's start with yours first.

41:10.100 --> 41:14.538
Well, I'm Alpha.
I'm running the security now.

41:14.571 --> 41:16.807
Okay, Alpha, where's Devlin?

41:16.840 --> 41:19.610
Oh, we've briefed
the new security on duty.

41:19.643 --> 41:20.911
Why don't you tell me
your location?

41:20.944 --> 41:22.513
We'll bring you up to speed.

41:22.546 --> 41:25.649
I think I'm already up to speed.

41:25.682 --> 41:27.651
I'll find you. How's that?

41:29.052 --> 41:30.854
Hello?

41:30.887 --> 41:31.922
[device beeps]

41:35.959 --> 41:37.928
Alright, listen up.

41:37.961 --> 41:40.664
We got a rogue security guard
on duty.

41:40.697 --> 41:43.867
I want you to find him,
take him out.

41:43.900 --> 41:46.103

[laughs] As a matter of fact,
she did.

45:00.163 --> 45:02.833
Told you.
She's got a smart mouth.

45:02.866 --> 45:04.468
Somebody needs to shut her up
permanently.

45:04.501 --> 45:07.971
- You leave her alone.
- Relax, Ms. Smart.

Sit.

Her mother left me
and took my daughter with her.

45:29.959 --> 45:32.463
I can see why, loser.

45:34.831 --> 45:37.968
Oh, I'm far from being a loser.

45:38.001 --> 45:41.872
In fact,
today I'm gonna win it all.

45:43.940 --> 45:45.175
How we lookin'?

45:46.509 --> 45:48.211
Still on track.
Digi-Coin coming in.

45:48.244 --> 45:49.446
Good.

45:49.479 --> 45:51.515
I can't wait
till my dad finds me.

45:51.548 --> 45:53.216
He works here in the arena.

45:53.249 --> 45:55.452
He's probably looking for me
right now.

45:55.485 --> 45:56.954
Oh, really?

45:59.122 --> 46:01.525
Why don't you tell me more
about your daddy?

46:01.558 --> 46:05.061

of the third quarter, 95.

46:11.568 --> 46:14.171
Did you find anything?

46:14.204 --> 46:16.907
I have searched every entrance
to this wing.

46:16.940 --> 46:18.942
Then we need to get the message
to everyone

46:18.975 --> 46:21.211
in this entire place
at the same time,

46:21.244 --> 46:24.147
to leave through the exits
we know are safe.

46:24.180 --> 46:25.382
How?

46:29.052 --> 46:31.989
[crowd cheering]

46:33.957 --> 46:36.526
How do I get
to whoever controls this?

46:36.559 --> 46:39.162
Oh, take this hallway
all the way to the end.

46:39.195 --> 46:40.931
It dead-ends at a elevator.

46:40.964 --> 46:42.599
Listen, take the elevator
to the top floor.

46:42.632 --> 46:44.935
When the doors open,
just keep going straight.

46:44.968 --> 46:47.838
It ends at
the Jumbotron operator's office.

46:47.871 --> 46:50.340
Guy's name is Al. Knock twice.

46:50.373 --> 46:52.008
I'mma stay here
and keep looking.

46:52.041 --> 46:54.311
Okay, if you find anything,
don't touch it. Call me.

46:54.344 --> 46:56.413
Oh, I'm not touching shit.

47:22.405 --> 47:24.407
- You ever heard of knocking?
- I'm sorry.

47:24.440 --> 47:26.309
But this is an emergency.
We're all in trouble.

47:26.342 --> 47:27.878
What do you mean,
"We're in trouble?"

47:27.911 --> 47:28.945
The arena security's been

47:28.978 --> 47:30.513
taken over by outside hostiles.

47:30.546 --> 47:33.216
[laughs] Man,
whatever you smokin',

47:33.249 --> 47:35.585
you need to give me some, 'cause
this job is boring as hell.

47:35.618 --> 47:38.154
- I'm not--
- Look, look. Look.

47:38.187 --> 47:39.623
Do you know what this is?

47:39.656 --> 47:41.124
- No.
- It's a bomb.

47:41.157 --> 47:43.126
Would you like to see
how it works?

47:43.159 --> 47:44.394
Is that a rhetorical question?

47:49.132 --> 47:51.067
Are you sure you really want me
to send this message out?

47:51.100 --> 47:52.335
'Cause this, this, this message

47:52.368 --> 47:54.070
is gonna evacuate
the entire arena.

47:54.103 --> 47:55.972
That's exactly what we want.

47:57.373 --> 47:59.142
If this comes back on me,

47:59.175 --> 48:01.311
I'm gonna tell 'em that you
held me hostage with a bomb!

48:01.344 --> 48:04.014
Fair enough. Now would you just
please send the...

48:04.047 --> 48:05.215
Oh, whoa.

48:05.248 --> 48:08.051

48:08.084 --> 48:11.054

[breathing heavily] Freeman.

49:25.495 --> 49:27.464
I'm surprised
you're still alive.

49:27.497 --> 49:31.401
I'd assumed
they killed all the guards.

49:31.434 --> 49:36.206
You stuck around even when
you realized something was off.

49:36.239 --> 49:37.707
My daughter's missing.

49:37.740 --> 49:40.377
I can't find her and I'm not
gonna leave without her.

49:43.046 --> 49:46.649
I'm really sorry to hear this,
but I need you to stay focused

49:46.682 --> 49:49.786
and finish telling me
everything you know.

49:49.819 --> 49:52.522
Well, whoever they are,
they're professionally trained.

49:52.555 --> 49:57.260
Prototype weaponry, maybe, uh,
covert or special-ops trained.

49:57.293 --> 49:59.362
[exhales sharply]
Maybe even a terrorist cell.

49:59.395 --> 50:01.164
- Anything else I should know?
- Well...

50:01.197 --> 50:04.601
They planted motion-sensitive
explosives at the exits.

50:04.634 --> 50:08.705
I managed to dismantle
most of them, I think.

50:08.738 --> 50:11.574
I always knew you were
an exceptional employee.

50:11.607 --> 50:14.310
A man that would do anything
to protect.

50:14.343 --> 50:16.713
- That's why I hired you.
- But, sir...

50:16.746 --> 50:19.249
What do you suggest we do
to take them out?

50:19.282 --> 50:23.620
Well, I think the first thing,
unfortunately, is...

50:23.653 --> 50:25.489
taking you out.

50:26.722 --> 50:28.191
Really?

50:33.296 --> 50:35.765
Spider. Caught the fly.

50:35.798 --> 50:39.335
Jobe on phone: Excellent.
- You're with them?

50:39.368 --> 50:41.771
How could you betray
your own people?

50:41.804 --> 50:44.474
Life isn't about loyalty, son.

50:44.507 --> 50:47.144
It's about green, lots of it.

50:49.345 --> 50:52.782
- Continue to surprise, Freeman.
- Shut up!

50:52.815 --> 50:55.318
You don't know anything
about me.

50:55.351 --> 50:56.686
If I submitted my real resume,

50:56.719 --> 50:58.621
you would've been too afraid
to hire me.

50:58.654 --> 51:00.690
Now take out your cuffs
and get on the ground

51:00.723 --> 51:02.425
before I put one in your leg.

51:02.458 --> 51:04.360
Can't do that.

He's on break.

52:04.287 --> 52:06.823
Jobe on phone: Jesse,
did you kill your boss?

52:06.856 --> 52:08.391
How do you know my name?

52:08.424 --> 52:11.661
Oh, well,
a little birdie told me.

52:11.694 --> 52:14.430
- Daddy!
- Mara!

52:14.463 --> 52:17.600
She's a cute little girl.
Smart mouth, though.

52:17.633 --> 52:22.272
I swear, you touch her, you die.

52:22.305 --> 52:24.240
You stay out of my way,

52:24.273 --> 52:26.843
allow me to finish what
I started, she'll be just fine.

52:26.876 --> 52:29.179
What if I can't do that?

52:29.212 --> 52:31.514
Well, then your daughter will be
one of many who die today.

52:31.547 --> 52:33.516
Where are you? Come on.

52:33.549 --> 52:36.352
- Where you hiding?
Jobe: I'm not hiding from you.

52:36.385 --> 52:38.655
Actually, I got the best seats
in the house.

52:38.688 --> 52:41.624
So you stay off my grid,

52:41.657 --> 52:44.394
and maybe your daughter
will live to see 11.

for breakfast.

53:23.499 --> 53:25.268

Freeman has a VIP badge
assigned to him.

53:27.737 --> 53:29.506
Onscreen now.

53:31.374 --> 53:35.312

- Leave my brother alone.

in breaking up families, kid.

I work with your dad.
He asked me to come and get you.

54:13.382 --> 54:15.351
But my dad told me
not to go anywhere.

54:15.384 --> 54:17.487
Hm. Smart kid, huh?

54:17.520 --> 54:20.523
But your dad sent me anyway,
so come on, let's go meet him.

no matter what.

for this. Get your ass up.

such a total loss for ya.

before it got too serious

55:02.098 --> 55:03.599

was a bitch-ass.

[crowd cheering]

01:00:43.238 --> 01:00:45.375
Dad, where are you?

01:00:50.412 --> 01:00:54.350
The owner's suite, huh?
See, that makes sense.

01:00:54.383 --> 01:00:56.986
That's where the rich people go
to watch the games.

01:00:57.019 --> 01:00:59.989
Nobody would ever think
to look for the bad guys there.

01:01:00.022 --> 01:01:03.793
Well, assuming they've the same
weapons as the other bad guys,

01:01:03.826 --> 01:01:05.394
I need the element of surprise.

01:01:05.427 --> 01:01:06.929
Yo, shirt.

01:01:08.931 --> 01:01:10.399
You go in through this way,

01:01:10.432 --> 01:01:13.936
surprise the hell
out of everyone.

01:01:13.969 --> 01:01:16.205
[groans]

01:01:16.238 --> 01:01:19.909
Well, looks like
I got no other choice.

01:01:25.414 --> 01:01:26.782
You're gonna need this.

01:01:26.815 --> 01:01:28.117
[scoffs]

01:01:30.252 --> 01:01:32.255
I'm gonna need
a lot more than...

01:01:39.895 --> 01:01:41.130
What?

01:01:44.099 --> 01:01:47.069
Look. I gave you the money.
Now just go.

01:01:47.102 --> 01:01:49.171
You and I both know
I can't just walk out of here.

01:01:49.204 --> 01:01:52.041
Just killing you, that wouldn't
be enough, would it?

01:01:52.074 --> 01:01:56.212
No. [sighs]
I need something bigger.

01:01:56.245 --> 01:02:00.816
I'm gonna call it
the, uh, Bloody Escape.

01:02:00.849 --> 01:02:04.754
[chuckles] Pretty good, huh?

01:02:04.787 --> 01:02:08.390
Please, don't hurt the innocent
citizens in the stadium.

01:02:08.423 --> 01:02:10.359
They just came to see the game.

01:02:10.392 --> 01:02:11.460
Who, these people?

01:02:11.493 --> 01:02:14.330
[crowd cheering]

01:02:14.363 --> 01:02:16.432
Fuck 'em. Psi.

01:02:17.933 --> 01:02:19.235
Thank you, Psi.

01:02:21.336 --> 01:02:22.939
This is for you.

01:02:24.106 --> 01:02:25.808
Yeah, go on, take it.

01:02:29.578 --> 01:02:31.013
Open it up.

01:02:33.582 --> 01:02:36.385
[chuckles] Now you see, Diana.

01:02:38.554 --> 01:02:43.259
Your name, your face,

01:02:43.292 --> 01:02:45.261
everything that you built

01:02:45.294 --> 01:02:48.297
has haunted me for two years.

01:02:48.330 --> 01:02:49.565
Soon I'm gonna fly away
from here,

01:02:49.598 --> 01:02:53.035
look down on you
like a fucking God

01:02:53.068 --> 01:02:55.171
and watch everything
that you built...

01:02:56.205 --> 01:03:00.009
be destroyed. Boom.

01:03:03.946 --> 01:03:06.883
[exhaling sharply]

01:03:11.186 --> 01:03:15.491
Oh, man, we missed one!

01:03:15.524 --> 01:03:19.562
Fuck! Goddamn it!

01:03:19.595 --> 01:03:22.431
Announcer: Thirty seconds left
in the period.

01:03:24.233 --> 01:03:26.502

Announcer: Micah Crews,
two-pointer, Falcons.

01:04:07.142 --> 01:04:11.280
Tie game. You know, I couldn't
have planned this any better.

01:04:11.313 --> 01:04:13.349
The audience is all gonna
stick around for the amazing

01:04:13.382 --> 01:04:15.517
conclusion, and all exit
virtually altogether

01:04:15.550 --> 01:04:18.254
and chaos
will still reign supreme.

01:04:18.287 --> 01:04:22.024
And by the time the cops
have dealt with the fallout,

01:04:22.057 --> 01:04:23.626
I'm gonna be long gone.

01:04:23.659 --> 01:04:26.295

01:04:34.269 --> 01:04:36.072

Oh, no.
I should have called in sick!

01:04:51.253 --> 01:04:52.889
Shh! Shh!

01:04:54.122 --> 01:04:57.526
What's that sound? Oh, yeah.

01:04:57.559 --> 01:05:01.063
This is "Game Over."

01:05:02.397 --> 01:05:03.632

01:05:09.404 --> 01:05:11.206
- Hey, sweetie.
Jobe: Alright.

01:05:11.239 --> 01:05:13.509
Now you must be
the security guard.

01:05:13.542 --> 01:05:16.979
- You must be Alpha.
- Hi.

01:05:17.012 --> 01:05:19.114
[whimpering]

01:05:19.147 --> 01:05:21.283

Crowd: Micah! Micah! Mi...

01:05:24.753 --> 01:05:27.289
You're too late.

01:05:27.322 --> 01:05:29.592
No, no, no. No, please
don't blow. Please don't...

- Hey!

01:06:06.061 --> 01:06:08.697
What happened?
What happened to the explosives?

01:06:08.730 --> 01:06:11.633
That's right. We defused
your little game, player.

01:06:11.666 --> 01:06:13.669
Hey, freeze.

01:06:13.702 --> 01:06:16.705
- Don't move.
- Wait a minute.

01:06:16.738 --> 01:06:19.208
That's just a T-shirt gun.

01:06:19.241 --> 01:06:20.776

01:06:50.539 --> 01:06:53.509
Oh, hell, yeah.
Much love, black man.

01:06:53.542 --> 01:06:55.511
- God bless you, man.
- He said he's flying away.

01:06:55.544 --> 01:06:57.046
My guess is he's heading
to the helipad on the roof.

01:06:57.079 --> 01:06:58.547
Take the main stairway
to the rafters.

01:06:58.580 --> 01:07:00.249

at the scene,

01:07:49.531 --> 01:07:51.667
but no confirmation of injuries
or fatal...

01:07:51.700 --> 01:07:53.335
Oh, my God.

This is a breaking news item,

01:07:54.703 --> 01:07:56.839

01:08:00.475 --> 01:08:03.278
Let my daughter go
and I'll let you live.

01:08:03.311 --> 01:08:07.449
Yeah, okay.
You can have her back.

01:08:07.482 --> 01:08:10.453
- In a few minutes, in pieces.
- Argh!

01:08:11.620 --> 01:08:13.889
- Ow!
- Stay.

01:08:13.922 --> 01:08:15.291
Daddy.

01:08:17.658 --> 01:08:20.395
Your guns don't work that far,
anyway.

01:08:20.428 --> 01:08:22.430
At least I figured that out.

01:08:25.667 --> 01:08:29.738
I had a perfect plan,
and you fucked it all up.

01:08:32.274 --> 01:08:35.411
Kick his ass, daddy!
Kick his ass!

[Mara grunting]

01:10:28.857 --> 01:10:31.393
Come here, sweetie.
We gotta get this off of you.

01:10:56.985 --> 01:10:59.921
I could stick around
for this sweet moment,

01:10:59.954 --> 01:11:02.591
but I think
I hear my ride pulling up.

01:11:02.624 --> 01:11:07.362
Plus, I just hate bad endings.
So here's what I'm gonna do.

01:11:07.395 --> 01:11:10.866
I'm gonna kill you
and your bitch daughter there

01:11:10.899 --> 01:11:12.567
and call it a day.

01:11:12.600 --> 01:11:15.537

- No.

01:12:06.755 --> 01:12:09.725
- Are you okay?
- [chuckles] It could be worse.

01:12:09.758 --> 01:12:12.795
If I came home without you,
your mom would kill me.

01:12:14.996 --> 01:12:16.565
Hey.

01:12:16.598 --> 01:12:18.033
You saved my life
and everyone in the arena.

01:12:18.066 --> 01:12:20.869
Uh, how did you figure out
how to work that gun?

01:12:20.902 --> 01:12:23.672
Basic thumb-press safety switch.

I was so worried.

01:12:45.093 --> 01:12:46.795
Were you really worried
about me?

01:12:46.828 --> 01:12:49.931
Yeah. I saw the whole fight
on the rafters.

01:12:49.964 --> 01:12:52.167
- You were amazing.
- Amazing?

01:12:52.200 --> 01:12:55.604
- He was lit.
- Let's go. [chuckles]

01:12:55.637 --> 01:12:58.807
Um, let's just keep
this whole day between us, okay?

01:12:58.840 --> 01:12:59.841
Both: Nope.

01:12:59.874 --> 01:13:02.811

01:13:05.046 --> 01:13:06.948
Hey.

01:13:06.981 --> 01:13:10.051
