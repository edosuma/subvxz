Jimmy Flaherty:
Ladies and gentlemen, Cam Calloway.

00:10.443 --> 00:14.580
I just wanna thank Mr. Jimmy Flaherty
for bringing me to Atlanta!

00:14.581 --> 00:16.982
There's four people
who forced me to believe

00:16.983 --> 00:20.452
that I and they were worthy
of a big time dream.

00:20.453 --> 00:24.162
Those four people that believed in me
are my family.

00:26.326 --> 00:29.128
You got big,
new money now, Cam.

00:29.129 --> 00:31.096
It is not your fault that
the world is the way it is

00:31.097 --> 00:33.065
or that where we left
ain't paradise.

00:33.066 --> 00:35.801
- I'm just a basketball player.
- Not anymore.

00:35.802 --> 00:37.803
Right now, we new money.

00:37.804 --> 00:39.938
Going with Da Chen Bao
sets this family up

00:39.939 --> 00:41.874
so that one day
we will have old money.

00:41.875 --> 00:44.777
Bottom line,
you gotta give back.

00:44.778 --> 00:47.246
How's it feel kicking
the world's ass like that?

00:47.247 --> 00:50.956
Oh, the world had it coming.

Plenty of folks believed in you,

01:59.786 --> 02:01.453

- Mm.

You know, that's just

'cause right now,

02:04.858 --> 02:07.226
kinda-- kinda feels
like we live in a movie.

02:07.227 --> 02:08.759
Nah, no, no, no,
if this was a movie,

02:08.761 --> 02:10.362
right about now, one of us
would be getting shot.

02:10.363 --> 02:12.831

I'm telling the truth, too.

- Oh, my God!

02:19.706 --> 02:21.540
Julius shot a moose!

02:21.541 --> 02:24.710
- Hey, he was charging us.
- It was not.

02:24.711 --> 02:25.911
He murdered it.

02:25.912 --> 02:27.813
It ain't "murder" if you eat it.

02:27.814 --> 02:29.481
I ain't eating no damn moose meat.

02:29.482 --> 02:31.116
That ain't no moose,
Ma, that's a deer.

02:31.117 --> 02:32.818

I ain't eating Bambi.

02:32.819 --> 02:34.486
Well, we can mount it

02:34.487 --> 02:35.954
Where the hell you get a gun,
Uncle Julius?

02:35.955 --> 02:37.156
Bass Pro Shop.

02:37.157 --> 02:38.490
What on earth for?

02:38.491 --> 02:40.225
They have low prices guaranteed.

this ain't the forest.

02:42.395 --> 02:44.062

02:44.063 --> 02:45.764
'Cause you shooting bucks in the head.

02:45.765 --> 02:47.299
I think you got this one
in the abdomen.

02:47.300 --> 02:48.934
- You can't shoot out here.
- (Julius muttering)

02:48.935 --> 02:51.103
Well, I'm not catching
"Lames" disease.

02:51.104 --> 02:52.638
It's Lyme disease.

02:52.639 --> 02:55.174
- He's still breathing.
- (screaming)

02:55.175 --> 02:58.143

- Does this house have a grill?

02:58.144 --> 03:00.379

what dirty Southerners do.

03:12.425 --> 03:14.359
Cam, just think,
if I hadn't accidently

03:14.360 --> 03:16.128
launched that lawn chair
off your roof deck,

03:16.129 --> 03:18.530
your condo association
would've never have kicked us out,

03:18.531 --> 03:20.899
and we would've never
moved here to Calloway Castle.

03:20.900 --> 03:22.834
You need to think on
how lucky you are

03:22.835 --> 03:25.837
nobody was barbequing
30 floors below,

03:25.838 --> 03:29.007
and your home is here,
not the Georgia damn State Pen.

03:29.008 --> 03:31.510
- You're right, Ma.
- Family, take it in.

03:31.511 --> 03:33.845
These are the good days
that we dreamt about.

03:33.846 --> 03:36.448
This is where we supposed to be,
together.

03:36.449 --> 03:38.483
- Yeah.
- Together, but enough square footage

03:38.484 --> 03:40.852
- to isolate.
- And never have to share a shitter.

03:40.853 --> 03:43.055
Family's that shit apart,
stick together.

03:43.056 --> 03:46.158
Well, my shit smell like fresh bread,

Well, you fools fight over bathrooms,
I'm going home to change.

03:49.529 --> 03:51.496
Cam, Flaherty's bowl-a-thon
starts at 5:00.

03:51.497 --> 03:52.831
- Let's go.
- Bowling?

03:52.832 --> 03:54.032
That's that shit I don't like.

03:54.033 --> 03:57.402
I like any game where the black things
knock down the white things,

03:57.403 --> 04:00.138
- and we get points for it.
- Racist, yet honest.

04:00.139 --> 04:01.974
Why don't you go for me, Uncle J?

04:01.975 --> 04:03.976
Cam, you're going, okay?

04:03.977 --> 04:06.044
It's Flaherty's party
for the luxury box owners.

04:06.045 --> 04:07.946
Well, I'm a player,
not a box owner.

04:07.947 --> 04:09.715
- Man, get me out of it, Reg.
- Reggie: I will...

04:09.716 --> 04:11.617
48 minutes after you show.

04:11.618 --> 04:13.222
Bowling's fun for everyone.

04:14.520 --> 04:16.654
Sorry, I tried.

04:16.656 --> 04:18.223
It's a mandatory team event.

04:18.224 --> 04:20.459
If you don't go, you get fined,
you know this.

04:20.459 --> 04:23.295
- Well, work your magic, Reg.
- Abraca-fucking-dabra.

04:23.296 --> 04:25.130
I just kept 50K in your bank account.

04:25.131 --> 04:27.366
Flaherty fines Cam 50K

04:27.367 --> 04:29.334
for not bowling
with some douchebags.

04:29.335 --> 04:31.903
Luxury box-owning douchebags.

04:31.904 --> 04:34.373
Those douchebags
help pay these bills.

04:34.374 --> 04:36.675
Look at Missy riffing on douchebag.

04:36.676 --> 04:38.377
I'm not immune to osmosis.

04:38.378 --> 04:40.178
Oh, come on, baby,
be grateful and go.

04:40.179 --> 04:43.782
Ma, I ooze gratitude,
but the season's about to start.

04:43.783 --> 04:46.118
I had a massive preseason.
Why?

04:46.119 --> 04:48.220
Rest and focus.
Bowling is neither.

04:48.221 --> 04:50.789
It hurts your back,
the scoring is confusing as shit.

04:50.790 --> 04:53.425
- Just tell Flaherty I'm sick.
- We don't lie anymore, remember?

04:53.426 --> 04:56.128
- That's in our mission statement.
- See, baby steps.

04:56.129 --> 04:58.463
- You know I'm proud of both of you.
- Can't we put a few stock lies

04:58.464 --> 05:00.299
back on the table,
make life a little easier?

05:00.300 --> 05:02.601
Tell Flaherty you got AIDS.

05:02.602 --> 05:05.404
- What?
- Yeah, he ain't risking AIDS.

05:05.405 --> 05:07.306
Bowl-a-thon, not fuck-a-thon,
Uncle J.

05:07.307 --> 05:09.308
How's Flaherty catching AIDS from Cam?

05:09.309 --> 05:11.143
HIV is the thing you catch.

05:11.144 --> 05:15.013
Maybe Flaherty got AIDS and he's trying
to find a fuck companion.

05:15.014 --> 05:16.648
Yeah, he needs a partner.

05:16.649 --> 05:18.684
Don't you be drinking no drinks
with Jimmy Flaherty.

05:18.685 --> 05:20.385
Every event that we attend,

05:20.386 --> 05:22.220
we build favor equity with Flaherty.

05:22.221 --> 05:25.057
His reach is far beyond basketball,
we want to tap into that reach.

05:25.058 --> 05:27.359
As the head of your public relations,
the man is right.

05:27.360 --> 05:29.061
Just got and relate to the public,

05:29.062 --> 05:31.229
give Flaherty his reach-around,
and then you can leave.

05:31.230 --> 05:34.132
Cam, you mind if I get rid of
this lawn decoration

05:34.133 --> 05:35.901
that the previous owners
left behind?

05:35.902 --> 05:37.436
Uh-uh, that might be
worth some money.

05:37.437 --> 05:39.838
- On!
- Shit.

05:39.839 --> 05:41.673
Even the more reason to smash it.

05:41.674 --> 05:43.875
- Missy, you are gangster.
- Bitch, you can't be throwing shit

05:43.876 --> 05:45.344
- around here, girl.
- I wanna do it.

05:45.345 --> 05:47.913
- Cassie: Oh, my God.
- (laughing)

05:47.914 --> 05:50.682
Man, you know,
the more I'm around her,

05:50.683 --> 05:52.317
the more that I like her.

05:52.318 --> 05:54.886
And not to be inappropriate,

05:54.887 --> 05:56.922
but I bet she wears you out.

05:56.923 --> 05:58.790
Mm-mm-mm.

05:58.791 --> 06:01.259
Okay, the "mm-mm-mm,"
that's pushing it.

06:01.260 --> 06:02.894
- Okay, I did too much on that?
- You did.

06:02.895 --> 06:04.296

08:50.596 --> 08:52.197
Hey, hey, hey,
look around, okay?

08:52.198 --> 08:55.367
Look around, man, your presence
is bringing people joy, Cam, all right?

08:55.368 --> 08:57.636
This is part of the dream.
Just breathe it in.

08:57.637 --> 09:00.171
I'm breathing it in.
It smells like drunk white people.

09:00.172 --> 09:02.874
Man, bullshit. White people
only smell when they're wet.

09:02.875 --> 09:04.242
You're supposed to be here

09:04.243 --> 09:06.478
so that I can be here
without actually being here.

09:06.479 --> 09:08.713
And when you're not here,
everybody else here

09:08.714 --> 09:10.615
is here,
right next to me!

09:10.616 --> 09:11.950
Asking me to do a bunch of things

09:11.951 --> 09:13.785
that a grown-ass man
should not be asked to do.

09:13.786 --> 09:16.054
- All right.
- (slurred) Give me a ride to the potty.

09:16.055 --> 09:19.057
Will you get this hobbit off me
before I bowl her for a strike?

09:19.058 --> 09:21.326
Listen, ma'am, Cam don't wanna
start the season with back problems.

09:21.327 --> 09:23.361
- (slurred) Are you calling me fat?
- I'm not calling you fat.

09:23.362 --> 09:24.496
(slurred)
Are you a fat shamer?

09:24.497 --> 09:26.865
You know how many season tickets
my daddy buys?

09:26.866 --> 09:29.234
- Eat me.
- Okay, now, now, there's no need...

09:29.235 --> 09:32.037
(slurred) I've been overserved,
but seriously, though,

09:32.038 --> 09:33.572
I loved your first press conference.

09:33.573 --> 09:36.074
It was very articulate.

09:36.075 --> 09:38.077
Look at Flaherty summoning me.

09:39.679 --> 09:41.713
No, I mean,
he's just having fun hosting.

09:41.714 --> 09:42.981
- (whispers) One sec, one sec.
- I'm out of here.

09:42.982 --> 09:44.222
No, no, no.
Cam, Cam, Cam.

09:47.320 --> 09:49.888
I'ma put a carrot in each one
of these daiquiris

09:49.889 --> 09:53.425
so I can boost my vision
so I know what I'm walking in to.

09:53.426 --> 09:57.395
- Hey, you bring us a gift bag?
- Yeah, this gigantic gift house.

09:57.396 --> 09:58.863
Yeah, you must've ate some shrimp.

09:58.864 --> 10:00.665
You know that shrimp
makes him grumpy.

10:00.666 --> 10:03.602
Flaherty is texting me,
"ls everything okay with Cam?"

10:03.603 --> 10:06.237
Oh, it is now,
'cause I'm here and not there.

10:06.238 --> 10:09.040
- He fucked me.
- Flaherty roofied you for real?

10:09.041 --> 10:10.875
- Wait, what?
- You don't remember?

10:10.876 --> 10:13.078
Don't wash your underwear.
The DNA's in there.

10:13.079 --> 10:14.813
No, he only fucked with my time.

10:14.814 --> 10:18.116
- I did my clown act for two hours.
- I got two words for you--

10:18.117 --> 10:20.452
contractual obligation!

10:20.453 --> 10:23.121
I got three words for you--
grown-ass man.

10:23.122 --> 10:25.724
That's two words, baby.
"Grown-ass" is hyphenated.

10:25.725 --> 10:28.360
- Bad form to blow off your owner.
- Amen.

10:28.361 --> 10:29.861
I called me over with two fingers

10:29.862 --> 10:32.063
like I was that lawn darkie
that Missy smashed.

10:32.064 --> 10:33.698
Jockey, not "darkie."

10:33.699 --> 10:36.101
He's not my owner.
Dogs have owners, okay?

10:36.102 --> 10:37.936
- He owns a team.
- And your contract.

10:37.937 --> 10:40.939
Which requires you to appear
at 25 events per calendar year.

10:40.940 --> 10:43.341
- This we agreed to.
- Because I agreed to something

10:43.342 --> 10:46.411
doesn't mean that he can make me
do other things at those things.

10:46.412 --> 10:49.280
My contract does not say
"stay to the end."

10:49.281 --> 10:52.417
- I appeared, and then I disappeared.
- No, you snubbed him.

10:52.418 --> 10:54.786
If you had just disappeared,
that would have been kinda cool.

10:54.787 --> 10:57.555
Yeah, it wouldn't been a dope Vine.
I really like that Houdini shit.

10:57.556 --> 11:00.091
Old Cam was running away
from the plantation.

11:00.092 --> 11:03.328
- It's Nat Turner time.
- Ease up on the rum, Julius.

11:03.329 --> 11:05.630
Hey, our ancestors
was bartered for rum.

11:05.631 --> 11:08.767
I thought you said you don't eat nothing
our ancestors were bartered for?

11:08.768 --> 11:10.068
Drinking ain't eating.

11:10.069 --> 11:11.736
Cam:
Flaherty's a man same as me.

11:11.737 --> 11:13.605
If he expects me to do
all this extra stuff,

11:13.606 --> 11:17.108
then he best learn to start
treating me like a grown-ass man.

11:17.109 --> 11:20.211
- Uncle J, you unpack that Xbox?
- Who loves you the most?

11:20.212 --> 11:22.681
Follow he.

11:22.682 --> 11:25.116
Texting Flaherty you got the runs.

11:25.117 --> 11:28.086
Wouldn't that lie shit in the face
of your new mission statement?

11:28.087 --> 11:31.189
Actually, text Flaherty
that he disrespected me.

11:31.190 --> 11:32.824
Let's get out of the past, okay?

11:32.825 --> 11:36.094
Get some rest, you got a ball signing
after practice tomorrow.

11:36.095 --> 11:37.262
Of course I do.

11:37.263 --> 11:39.764
Ball signing?
What's Friday, shaft stroking?

11:39.765 --> 11:41.099
Nelson Mandela night.

11:41.100 --> 11:42.867
Man, fuck Nelson Mandela!

11:42.868 --> 11:44.035
- Yo!
- Hey, hey, hey!

11:44.036 --> 11:45.470
- Time.
- What's wrong with you?

11:45.471 --> 11:47.472
Man, you done lost
your rabid-ass mind.

11:47.473 --> 11:49.040
No, I said it, I'm owning it.

11:49.041 --> 11:50.508
My job is playing hoop.

11:50.509 --> 11:52.210
And if Flaherty wants me
focused on that job,

11:52.211 --> 11:54.446
remind him the season
starts next week.

11:54.447 --> 11:58.083
Let's roll, Unc. Let's build
that beach house on Minecraft.

11:58.084 --> 12:00.189
(music playing)

12:02.288 --> 12:05.190
Charles, your new salon is on "fleet."

12:05.191 --> 12:07.425
It's "fleek," Ma, with a "K."

12:07.426 --> 12:09.227
But that's not how I say it.

12:09.228 --> 12:10.895
Anybody want a hit of
this peach schnapps?

12:10.896 --> 12:13.398
- I just had a Valium, I'm good.
- Missy?

12:13.399 --> 12:16.401
Better to be buzzed before that
creamy crack hits your scalp.

12:16.402 --> 12:18.536
I'll suffer through it
like I've done my whole life.

12:18.537 --> 12:19.804
You know,
one of these days,

12:19.805 --> 12:22.874
I'll get the courage to just
chop it all off and start fresh.

12:22.875 --> 12:24.909
It sounds courageous,
looks stupid.

12:24.910 --> 12:27.011
Plenty of sisters are transitioning.

12:27.012 --> 12:29.547
Yeah, they go from looking
like a woman to looking like a man.

12:29.548 --> 12:31.516
I mean, it's the 21 st century,
fuck the afro.

12:31.517 --> 12:33.585
Every bitch cuts her hair,
thinks she's gonna look like Lupita.

12:33.586 --> 12:36.988
And most of them end up looking like
Laurence Fishburne with tits.

12:36.989 --> 12:38.723
Chineka transitioned.

12:38.724 --> 12:40.458
She doesn't look like
Laurence Fishburne.

12:40.459 --> 12:41.826
The exception, not the rule.

12:41.827 --> 12:44.395
- Aw, thanks, boo.
- No, thank you.

12:44.396 --> 12:46.498
You know what seems stupid?
No offense.

12:46.499 --> 12:48.399
Is sitting in a salon year after year

12:48.400 --> 12:51.736
forcing our hair into something
that goes against who we are.

12:51.737 --> 12:53.338
You saying I don't make a good blonde?

12:53.339 --> 12:56.074
I'm saying that I wouldn't mind
looking like Chineka here.

12:56.075 --> 12:58.877
An amazing, proud,
natural woman.

12:58.878 --> 13:01.312
Look at that hair,
it's stunning.

13:01.313 --> 13:04.215
- Oh, stop. No, keep going.
- (laughter)

13:04.216 --> 13:06.851
Chineka, how long you been rocking
Mother Nature's bush up there?

13:06.852 --> 13:09.354
Buzzed it last Christmas
and never looked back.

13:09.355 --> 13:10.922
How long before
you looked in the mirror?

13:10.923 --> 13:11.923
A week.

13:11.924 --> 13:14.125
And how many nights
have you cried yourself to sleep?

13:14.126 --> 13:16.227
- 42.
- Mm-hmm.

13:16.228 --> 13:18.129
Shit, that's Jackie Robinson's number.

13:18.130 --> 13:20.565
Missy, Jackie is speaking to you.

13:20.566 --> 13:22.367
He is telling you to be
a barrier breaker.

13:22.368 --> 13:24.469
To throw out that creamy crack
and start fresh.

13:24.470 --> 13:26.571
Cry yourself to sleep for 42 nights.

13:26.572 --> 13:29.174
- You got wig money.
- Mm, I'm burning.

13:29.175 --> 13:31.676
- Charles, wash me out.
- (laughing)

13:31.677 --> 13:33.311
Cassie:
It ain't funny.

13:33.312 --> 13:36.214
Charles, hurry up!

13:36.215 --> 13:39.117
- Welcome aboard, Todd.
- Appreciate the job, sir.

13:39.118 --> 13:41.619
- Uh, please, call me Reggie.
- I prefer "sir."

13:41.620 --> 13:44.088
Role as house manager
is service and respect.

13:44.089 --> 13:46.357
Yeah, but sir,
it just kinda sounds sarcastic.

13:46.358 --> 13:47.559
Unintentionally.

13:47.560 --> 13:48.860
The use of the address "sir"

13:48.861 --> 13:50.628
reminds me that I'm not
in your family nor a friend.

13:50.629 --> 13:52.797
I'm in your employ
and the employ of your cousin.

13:52.798 --> 13:56.334
My job-- alleviate your pressures
and ensure the property runs smoothly.

13:56.335 --> 14:00.305
My ideal profile-- low, quietly
in the background where I belong.

14:00.306 --> 14:02.473
(chuckles)
All right, all right.

14:02.474 --> 14:05.610
Listen, uh, you know, my cousin,
he just-- he needs assurances

14:05.611 --> 14:08.146
that the security system works,
the cars are taken care of,

14:08.147 --> 14:10.415
the lawn don't grow, and that
the housekeeper keeps the house,

14:10.416 --> 14:13.451
so on and so forth, so he can
just focus on playing basketball.

14:13.452 --> 14:15.453
- I'm at your service, sir.
- All right.

14:15.454 --> 14:17.455
Coke is courting us.

14:17.456 --> 14:20.027
Let this be the only "coke"
comes in the house.

14:21.360 --> 14:23.695
Nothing?

14:23.696 --> 14:25.663
Okay.

14:25.664 --> 14:28.299
- (Julius snoring)
- Unc.

14:28.300 --> 14:31.436
- What?
- Wake up, man, it's time to go.

14:31.437 --> 14:33.938
Uh, Mr. Calloway.
(chuckling)

14:33.939 --> 14:37.642
We have another table of balls.
Just 25 more, we'll release you.

14:37.643 --> 14:39.344
"Release me"?

14:39.345 --> 14:41.613
- You the prison warden?
- We give these to charities.

14:41.614 --> 14:43.848
Can you just sign a few more, please?
I'm so sorry.

14:43.849 --> 14:46.017
I'll sign one more.

14:46.018 --> 14:48.920
You know, I got a big day,
lots of things to do.

14:48.921 --> 14:51.189
Lots of game-related stuff to do

14:51.190 --> 14:54.467
that if I don't do well, it won't make
anyone want a ball signed by me.

15:00.699 --> 15:03.167
You got a lid for this?

15:03.168 --> 15:06.012
(music playing)

15:13.212 --> 15:15.246
Oh...

15:15.247 --> 15:17.284
(door opens, closes)

15:22.354 --> 15:24.422
- (shuddering)
- Baby, what happened?

15:24.423 --> 15:27.091
Who did this to you?
Did you call the police?

15:27.092 --> 15:29.294
No one did it to me.

15:29.295 --> 15:33.402
I went to the salon,
and I had it all cut off.

15:34.533 --> 15:36.301
What?

15:36.302 --> 15:38.569
Why?

15:38.570 --> 15:42.941
I'm sick of forcing myself
to accept another ethnicity's ideal.

15:42.942 --> 15:44.409
Did M-Chuck make you do this?

15:44.410 --> 15:47.145
I just wanted to start fresh.

15:47.146 --> 15:50.286
Be the me I'm supposed to be.

15:54.820 --> 15:56.688
How bad does it look?

15:56.689 --> 16:00.569
Well, you're crying,
so you know the answer.

16:06.565 --> 16:09.534
It'll grow back, right?

16:09.535 --> 16:12.778
Yes. Yes, baby.

16:19.144 --> 16:22.180
Wow, you can see your scalp.

16:22.181 --> 16:24.716
- (crying continues)
- Sorry, I'm sorry.

16:24.717 --> 16:27.585
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

16:27.586 --> 16:31.625
(music playing)

16:39.465 --> 16:42.734
Yo! This is my parking spot.

16:42.735 --> 16:45.603
Appears to now be
a handicapped spot.

16:45.604 --> 16:47.171
Yesterday it was not.

16:47.172 --> 16:50.708
It is autumn,
change is everywhere.

16:50.709 --> 16:52.944
There's handicapped spots right there.

16:52.945 --> 16:54.645
Yes, filled with a car.

16:54.646 --> 16:56.848
Every day, the world
makes more cripples.

16:56.849 --> 16:58.983
Garages must keep pace.

16:58.984 --> 17:02.086
But how does my spot
turn handi-spot?

17:02.087 --> 17:03.988
They take blue paint and paint it.

17:03.989 --> 17:05.923
Okay, I got practice.

17:05.924 --> 17:08.826
I'm gonna park here
in what was just my spot yesterday.

17:08.827 --> 17:12.463
Yes, sir, no problem, but do you
have the handicapped placard?

17:12.464 --> 17:14.799
Uh, no, not yet, but I will.

17:14.800 --> 17:17.435
And whoever made this
a handicapped spot, they will, too.

17:17.435 --> 17:19.771
Ah, then this new spot

17:19.771 --> 17:23.151
is probably in anticipation
of that very moment.

17:24.410 --> 17:26.010
You know what, let's reboot.
I'm Cam.

17:26.011 --> 17:30.214
Yes, each day you walk by
without removing your headphones.

17:30.215 --> 17:31.349
- Oh.
- I'm Abeo.

17:31.350 --> 17:33.117
Cool accent, Abeo.
Where you from?

17:33.118 --> 17:37.488
Nigeria, where one follows the rules
or life gets very sad.

17:37.489 --> 17:40.491
Well, here in America, when random
rules are changed without warning,

17:40.492 --> 17:42.860
we ignore them
with a thing called a protest.

17:42.861 --> 17:46.197
Parking here is my protest.
Excuse me.

17:46.198 --> 17:48.232
I admire your activism.

17:48.233 --> 17:51.369
In Nigeria, I would now
be ordered to shoot you.

17:51.370 --> 17:55.375
But we're in America,
so have a nice day.

17:58.477 --> 18:00.645
- (cell phone beeps)
- Call Reggie.

18:00.646 --> 18:04.082
(engine revs, tires screech)

18:04.083 --> 18:06.120
(music playing)

18:08.000 --> 18:14.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

18:16.762 --> 18:18.799
(doorbell ringing)

18:21.600 --> 18:23.434
Flaherty changed my parking spot!

18:23.435 --> 18:25.670
Okay, surprise visit,
but how was practice?

18:25.671 --> 18:27.638
Shitty!
You gotta get in Flaherty's face!

18:27.639 --> 18:29.507
Okay, some things are house calls,
some things are phone calls.

18:29.508 --> 18:31.409
I called you before I went into
practice, you never called me back.

18:31.410 --> 18:33.411
- No, I-l text you.
- Yeah, you said, "Hit me back."

18:33.412 --> 18:35.813
I'm hitting you back in person.
I-- I need some water.

18:35.814 --> 18:37.748
Okay, look, how are you
doing today, man?

18:37.749 --> 18:39.450
- You good?
- Look, Flaherty knows

18:39.451 --> 18:41.319
that this is gonna
fucking piss me off.

18:41.320 --> 18:43.421
And, you know, he's-- he's wanting me
to do something stupid

18:43.422 --> 18:45.890
like skip practice
just so he can fucking fine me!

18:45.891 --> 18:47.225
Okay, dude, come on now.

18:47.226 --> 18:49.160
You dreamed to be a star,
you're the star

18:49.161 --> 18:51.262
with all the shit thereto appertaining.

18:51.263 --> 18:52.597
Focus on that, all right?

18:52.598 --> 18:54.265
Don't sweat Flaherty
doing Flaherty shit.

18:54.266 --> 18:55.399
- That's what they do.
- Reg!

18:55.400 --> 18:56.567
- That's owners--
- Reg!

18:56.568 --> 18:58.469
- What?
- You know me. He doesn't know me.

18:58.470 --> 19:01.672
- He does not know how hard that I work.
- Okay, we're on the move again.

19:01.673 --> 19:03.474
And, you know what?
Now I'm worked up.

19:03.475 --> 19:05.676
Now, you're the guy
who once we signed this big contract,

19:05.677 --> 19:08.212
you compared us to
survivors of a shipwreck,

19:08.213 --> 19:10.148
obligated to help
everybody we know

19:10.149 --> 19:12.450
to payback the universe
for all of our hard-earned blessing.

19:12.451 --> 19:15.386
You remember that? Now, I'm trying
to reconcile that guy with this guy.

19:15.387 --> 19:18.055
- That is not this.
- That is this, and this is that.

19:18.056 --> 19:19.457
And you gotta choose your battles.

19:19.458 --> 19:22.126
Only a moron marches into war
over a parking spot.

19:22.127 --> 19:23.895
- Oh, you calling me a moron?
- No, I'm saying you're making nothing

19:23.896 --> 19:26.330
- into something.
- Reg, I'm here at this point in my life

19:26.331 --> 19:28.032
- because I made nothing into something.
- Oh, Cam, calm the fuck--

19:28.033 --> 19:29.700
I'm here because I threaded he needle.

19:29.701 --> 19:33.004
lam 6'2", 175 pounds,
playing pro ball.

19:33.005 --> 19:35.740
That doesn't happen without hard work
and the force of my will.

19:35.741 --> 19:37.775
I gotta work harder than others.

19:37.776 --> 19:39.944
Okay, look, just-just-just sleep on it.

19:39.945 --> 19:41.379
- Let me get into it.
- No, man, I don't want to

19:41.380 --> 19:42.647
fucking sleep on it!

19:42.648 --> 19:44.482
I'd rather just sleep!

19:44.483 --> 19:46.851
Get some good night rest
like I've been trying to do

19:46.852 --> 19:49.220
to get up to workout,
to work hard,

19:49.221 --> 19:51.355
do shit that motherfuckers
like me don't do.

19:51.356 --> 19:53.291
Fucking yoga and Pilates,

19:53.292 --> 19:55.326
so I can lift weights,
watch film,

19:55.327 --> 19:58.462
work on my free throws, shit that's
gonna make me better for the season.

19:58.463 --> 19:59.997
Flaherty knows all of that.

19:59.998 --> 20:03.067
Flaherty thinks every hour
is his hour, it's not.

20:03.068 --> 20:05.369
I've gotta fill my hours
with real work.

20:05.370 --> 20:07.471
Hard work is the only thing
that's keeping me

20:07.472 --> 20:10.174
from fucking this whole thing up
and going back to being a nobody.

20:10.175 --> 20:12.610
Cam, you make too much money now
to ever be a nobody again.

20:12.611 --> 20:14.111
No, money doesn't make you somebody.

20:14.112 --> 20:16.080
Being somebody makes you somebody.

20:16.081 --> 20:17.882
Set his ass straight.

20:17.883 --> 20:20.885
Okay.
That's it?

20:20.886 --> 20:22.797
Great to see you, safe home.

20:25.190 --> 20:27.258
The players say
there's a dead spot right here.

20:27.259 --> 20:28.626
Will you look into that for me, please?

20:28.627 --> 20:30.094
And do something about this.

20:30.095 --> 20:32.463
We're selling basketball,
not Brawny paper towels.

20:32.464 --> 20:34.398
Reggie:
You changed his parking spot?

20:34.399 --> 20:37.435
Oh! I got your cousin's attention.

20:37.436 --> 20:39.537
Couldn't get it the other night.

20:39.538 --> 20:43.350
Couldn't get it yesterday when
he signed this "indentured servant."

20:47.779 --> 20:50.548
Okay, Jimmy, Cam's focus

20:50.549 --> 20:53.017
is winning on the court, okay?

20:53.018 --> 20:56.220
Taking your team to that next level,
that's his main obligation.

20:56.221 --> 20:58.022
Your cousin has other obligations.

20:58.023 --> 21:01.058
Obligations outlined
in the contract you negotiated.

21:01.059 --> 21:03.394
The truth?
They were left a little vague.

21:03.395 --> 21:06.430
He's embarrassing himself.
But worse, he's embarrassing me.

21:06.431 --> 21:08.766
Does he even know
what an indentured servant is?

21:08.767 --> 21:10.735
Oh, he crushed his verbal S.A.T.

21:10.736 --> 21:13.738
Well, then let's conjure up
the spirits of some indentured servants

21:13.739 --> 21:17.041
who worked for squat for
seven to ten years to repay the cost

21:17.042 --> 21:19.210
of a disease-ridden
transatlantic boat ride.

21:19.211 --> 21:21.178
The Irish brethren of my forebears.

21:21.179 --> 21:22.446
Well, you don't wanna compare

21:22.447 --> 21:24.415
disease-ridden transatlantic
boat rides with me.

21:24.416 --> 21:26.784
Only seven to ten before freedom?
(chuckles)

21:26.785 --> 21:29.920
Sounds like your Irish bros
got off better than my African ones.

21:29.921 --> 21:32.723
Mine got--
Oh, right, zero till lynched.

21:32.724 --> 21:35.526
Not all of 'em got lynched,
plenty got shot for no reason.

21:35.527 --> 21:37.962
Diane.

21:37.963 --> 21:40.298
Reggie, this is Diane,
my new assistant.

21:40.299 --> 21:43.234
Diane, Reggie's cousin
is the indentured servant

21:43.235 --> 21:46.337
who parked his Aston Martin
in your handicapped spot.

21:46.338 --> 21:49.373
- I apologize for my cousin.
- Common occurrence.

21:49.374 --> 21:51.609
Diane, get on Amazon Prime
and order me a Ouija board.

21:51.610 --> 21:54.345
Reggie and I are gonna conjure up
the ghosts of some indentured servants.

21:54.346 --> 21:55.713
- Right away.
- Get one of the drones

21:55.714 --> 21:57.081
to fly it down here today.

21:57.082 --> 22:00.518
Listen, any conjuring of ghosts will
only serve to freak me the fuck out.

22:00.519 --> 22:01.652
I don't like ghosts.

22:01.653 --> 22:03.888
Yet your cousin seems to be
impersonating one

22:03.889 --> 22:06.457
every time he's got
an off-court obligation.

22:06.458 --> 22:08.793
I'm now showing you both
a shit ton of respect

22:08.794 --> 22:11.095
because I retain the hope that
all those smiley, happy things

22:11.096 --> 22:14.098
we said to each other
when Cam signed here are still possible.

22:14.099 --> 22:17.702
He brought me his problem,
I'm bringing it to you, let's fix it.

22:17.703 --> 22:20.638
I'm fixing it by telling you
to get your cousin set straight.

22:20.639 --> 22:22.973
Stop making your problems
my problems.

22:22.974 --> 22:24.475
You guys are showing me right now

22:24.476 --> 22:26.344
you're not the kind of men
I thought you were.

22:26.345 --> 22:28.646
I thought you were givers,
seems to me you're just takers.

22:28.647 --> 22:31.048
You should've called me
before you changed his parking spot.

22:31.049 --> 22:32.750
You shouldn't tell me
how to run my business

22:32.751 --> 22:34.352
when I'm paying Cam a fuck ton.

22:34.353 --> 22:36.120
That's right, I used
"shit ton" and "fuck ton"

22:36.121 --> 22:37.555
within 30 seconds of each other.

22:37.556 --> 22:40.291
I'm like that--
unpredictable when provoked.

22:40.292 --> 22:42.363
Maybe you should go into
law enforcement.

22:45.697 --> 22:47.998
Friday is Nelson Mandela night.

22:47.999 --> 22:50.568
I expect Cam to be there
representing the team

22:50.569 --> 22:52.670
and paying respects
to Nelson Mandela.

22:52.671 --> 22:55.777
I can't make any promises.

22:56.908 --> 22:58.309
Hey, Reggie,

22:58.310 --> 23:01.679
Cam doesn't wanna get into
a pissing contest with me.

23:01.680 --> 23:04.548
I'm the most hydrated man you know.

23:04.549 --> 23:06.586
(music playing)

23:20.532 --> 23:23.167
You know, uh, no offense,
but that look like

23:23.168 --> 23:25.269
- a bag of Skittles on your head.
- Not helping.

23:25.270 --> 23:26.437
Dude, come on.

23:26.438 --> 23:29.607
- You can't blow off Mandela night.
- I'm not blowing it off.

23:29.608 --> 23:32.143
I'm choosing to honor Mr. Mandela
in a way of my own

23:32.144 --> 23:34.111
at a time of my choosing.

23:34.112 --> 23:37.081
Yeah, it's like when Prince decided
not to sing on "We Are the World."

23:37.082 --> 23:39.216
He's gonna stomp out hunger
in his high-heel boots,

23:39.217 --> 23:42.386
- not pimping next to Bob Seger.
- Bruce Springsteen.

23:42.387 --> 23:46.056
- Same difference, Ma.
- Folks, transportation has arrived.

23:46.057 --> 23:48.459
- I like having butlers.
- I don't.

23:48.460 --> 23:50.461
You know, white people steal, too.

23:50.462 --> 23:54.098
Cam, you don't wanna get in
a pissing contest with Jimmy Flaherty.

23:54.099 --> 23:55.633
How's he supposed to know
how to respect me

23:55.634 --> 23:57.234
if I don't show him how it's done?

23:57.235 --> 23:59.203
You get copies of
your bank statements, right?

23:59.204 --> 24:02.406
- It ain't always about the money.
- It's always about the money.

24:02.407 --> 24:04.575
No, you gotta show people
that can't be messed with

24:04.576 --> 24:06.410
so that they won't mess with you.

24:06.411 --> 24:08.186
Y'all can go ahead,
man, I'm good.

24:19.624 --> 24:21.661
This is a bad idea.

24:24.663 --> 24:27.701
(singing in foreign language)

24:35.273 --> 24:37.475
Missy, looking great.

24:37.476 --> 24:40.644
Yeah, she done went
and got all Winnied up.

24:40.645 --> 24:42.746
Pre-murder and fraud charges.

24:42.747 --> 24:45.216
- Looking dapper, Jimmy.
- No, I'm not.

24:45.217 --> 24:48.085
I, like most men, should not veer off
fashion's main boulevard,

24:48.086 --> 24:49.520
but thank you for saying so.

24:49.521 --> 24:52.323
- Where's Cam?
- He stayed home.

24:52.324 --> 24:55.392
- Not feeling right.
- Sorry to hear that.

24:55.393 --> 24:57.595
Well, thank you all for being here.

24:57.596 --> 25:00.297
- I must mingle.
- Cheers.

25:00.298 --> 25:03.667
He is pissed.
Call Cam.

25:03.668 --> 25:06.537
What, make him happy
that Flaherty's mad? Mm-mm.

25:06.538 --> 25:09.106
No, I'm gonna have a drink,
I'm gonna dance with my beautiful wife,

25:09.107 --> 25:11.986
and be glad that the contract
Cam signed is guaranteed.

25:14.045 --> 25:17.314
- I gotta shit.
- Why do you have to announce that?

25:17.315 --> 25:19.049
It's like he wants people
to go with him, Ma.

25:19.050 --> 25:21.151
Just go do it, Uncle Julius.

25:21.152 --> 25:25.256
Announcer on game: And this
over-celebration is embarrassing.

25:25.257 --> 25:27.858
- Put the ball in the goal and act...
- Sir?

25:27.859 --> 25:29.426
A Mr. Flaherty to see you.

25:29.427 --> 25:31.464
Jimmy:
I told you he knows who I am!

25:34.599 --> 25:36.901
Blowing off Mandela night is dumb.

25:36.902 --> 25:40.137
Mandela preached passive resistant.
I'm following his lead.

25:40.138 --> 25:43.173
Nelson Mandela was
unjustly imprisoned for 27 years.

25:43.174 --> 25:44.341
What point you making--

25:44.342 --> 25:46.644
that you're an ungrateful prick
upset about stupid shit?

25:46.645 --> 25:48.412
My time is "stupid shit"?

25:48.413 --> 25:50.514
I'm trying to build your franchise
and bring you a title.

25:50.515 --> 25:52.859
(whistle blows on game)

25:54.119 --> 25:56.487
Here's one the ways that works--

25:56.488 --> 25:58.789
we make people think
that the sport your playing

25:58.790 --> 26:01.325
is worth them parting
with a portion of their paycheck.

26:01.326 --> 26:04.395
We do it through advertising
and promotion and charitable activities.

26:04.396 --> 26:06.397
But one of the most
effective ways we do that,

26:06.398 --> 26:09.800
is we show up, we shake hands,
and we say thank you.

26:09.801 --> 26:13.037
What I care about is the season,
success on the floor.

26:13.038 --> 26:16.040
Okay, I'm not an indentured servant,
but I'm also not an errand boy

26:16.041 --> 26:18.242
or a mascot in parking lot G.

26:18.243 --> 26:21.245
- I'm a grown-ass man.
- ls that in dispute?

26:21.246 --> 26:23.180
You going bald
on the nutsack or something?

26:23.181 --> 26:25.916
At the bowl-a-thon,
you called me over with two fingers.

26:25.917 --> 26:27.718
You might as well whistled
like I'm a dog.

26:27.719 --> 26:30.354
- And I'm not having it!
- Cam, look at me.

26:30.355 --> 26:32.323
I'm wearing a dashiki.
Why?

26:32.324 --> 26:35.326
Because it's Nelson Mandela night.
I look ridiculous!

26:35.327 --> 26:38.295
There's a fucking hat that goes with it,
too, but I left that in the car.

26:38.296 --> 26:40.664
But the Mandela organization
asked me to wear it,

26:40.665 --> 26:42.566
and so here I am wearing it.

26:42.567 --> 26:45.703
Sometimes grown-ass men
gotta do things they don't wanna do.

26:45.704 --> 26:47.571
You called me over like this!

26:47.572 --> 26:50.841
Where I come from, that's how
you get a person to come near you.

26:50.842 --> 26:54.346
You wave them over with
the part of your body made for waving.

26:56.014 --> 26:57.681
You're treating me like a boy.

26:57.682 --> 26:59.750
Are you shitting me?

26:59.751 --> 27:02.419
Where does this idea come from

27:02.420 --> 27:04.388
that one man calling another man
across the room

27:04.389 --> 27:07.458
miniaturizes one of those people
into a boy?

27:07.459 --> 27:10.561
This means I've got some good shit
for you to hear.

27:10.562 --> 27:12.930
This is where the good shit starts.

27:12.931 --> 27:14.565
No, not from where I'm standing.

27:14.566 --> 27:17.401
I wanted to introduce you
to a season-ticket holder

27:17.402 --> 27:19.803
who beat cancer by sticking to
your workout regiment

27:19.804 --> 27:22.906
that he read about in
"Sports Illustrated" for fuck sake!

27:22.907 --> 27:26.610
The music was blaring, bowling pins
are getting knocked down left and right.

27:26.611 --> 27:29.947
That room was a shit show of sound
with a bunch of drunks,

27:29.948 --> 27:32.716
but there were a lot of people there
I wanted you to meet.

27:32.717 --> 27:35.285
People who can expand your business
off the court.

27:35.286 --> 27:37.488
I know what you aspire to.

27:37.489 --> 27:38.956
I believe in you.

27:38.957 --> 27:41.792
I believe in your talent.
I'm paying you like I do.

27:41.793 --> 27:44.695
But if you're gonna treat me
like I'm just some asshole owner

27:44.696 --> 27:48.165
out to inconvenience you,
I'll find you another team.

27:48.166 --> 27:50.501
You need some more security
at these events.

27:50.502 --> 27:52.503
Those people were all over me.

27:52.504 --> 27:56.140
One night a year, the folks who buy
the tickets that pay your salary

27:56.141 --> 27:57.775
have a right to be all over you.

27:57.776 --> 27:59.977
See, do you see what
you're doing right there?

27:59.978 --> 28:03.113
You're trying to teach me,
you're trying to school me.

28:03.114 --> 28:06.016
Talk to me, not at me.

28:06.017 --> 28:08.429
I'm a grown-ass man.

28:10.522 --> 28:12.559
(sighs)

28:15.360 --> 28:17.661
I will consider your personal time.

28:17.662 --> 28:21.065
But if we're gonna make this
a worthy experience,

28:21.066 --> 28:23.367
titles or not,
you gotta do two things.

28:23.368 --> 28:26.303
One, drastically limit what annoys.

28:26.304 --> 28:30.150
And two, stop saying things like
"I'm a grown-ass man."

28:31.476 --> 28:33.717
All it does is tell people you're not.

28:38.483 --> 28:41.452
Tonight, the team
is honoring a great man

28:41.453 --> 28:45.022
and raising awareness for causes
that help people in Africa.

28:45.023 --> 28:47.224
Apparently, there's still
some problems over there.

28:47.225 --> 28:49.927
I would like my star player
in attendance.

28:49.928 --> 28:53.230
If you choose to stay home...

28:53.231 --> 28:55.268
so be it.

Mandela liked the the Carpenters?

29:25.430 --> 29:27.464
Hell, everybody liked the carpenters.

29:27.465 --> 29:30.300
Who you think built your house?

29:30.301 --> 29:33.036
Kids sound great.

29:33.037 --> 29:35.305
Sorry about the song choice.

29:35.306 --> 29:37.684
The chorus choice.

29:39.144 --> 29:41.278
And the Mandela painting.

29:41.279 --> 29:43.580
I've been trying not to micromanage.

29:43.581 --> 29:45.749
Now you see why I have to.

29:45.750 --> 29:49.286
You can leave anytime.

29:49.287 --> 29:51.324
After the chorus.
