00:01.560 --> 00:06.070
<b>I can no longer think of him...</b>

00:06.590 --> 00:09.980
<b>as a target to destroy.</b>

00:10.800 --> 00:13.760
<b>He acknowledged our efforts.</b>

00:14.540 --> 00:16.390
<b>He wasn't a bad guy.</b>

00:18.610 --> 00:22.100
<b>In that case, I no longer have...</b>

00:23.050 --> 00:25.030
<b>any reason to defeat him.</b>

00:25.660 --> 00:27.000
<b>The King...</b>

00:27.470 --> 00:30.000
<b>The soldiers are not important.</b>

00:30.310 --> 00:34.980
<b>If the King waves his baton, the soldiers 
will become demons if necessary.</b>

01:56.010 --> 02:01.010
<b>Pose x And x Name</b>

03:09.800 --> 03:13.730
<b>This is an area used for testing weapons of war.</b>

03:15.670 --> 03:18.550
<b>We won't need to restrain ourselves.</b>

03:27.950 --> 03:29.480
<b>Why do you fight?</b>

03:32.310 --> 03:34.490
<b>You have no chance of defeating me.</b>

03:35.910 --> 03:38.220
<b>Why rush to your death?</b>

03:44.390 --> 03:47.350
<b>You presume to know I cannot win?</b>

03:47.720 --> 03:50.120
<b>You know nothing about me.</b>

03:53.440 --> 03:55.800
<b>If you judge me by my appearance,</b>

03:56.810 --> 03:59.200
<b>you'll get burned.</b>

04:00.130 --> 04:01.260
<b>You have it backwards.</b>

04:03.010 --> 04:07.470
<b>You don't seem like some ordinary man 
who can't read the state of the battle.</b>

04:09.160 --> 04:12.940
<b>I was born to rule this world.</b>

04:13.380 --> 04:18.400
<b>Originally, you humans were as 
no more than livestock to me.</b>

04:19.860 --> 04:21.530
<b>But I have changed my mind.</b>

04:24.670 --> 04:29.720
<b>I learned that there are a few 
humans worth keeping alive.</b>

04:31.180 --> 04:33.000
<b>Like that woman.</b>

04:37.690 --> 04:41.000
<b>I sense that you are worthy, as well.</b>

04:43.260 --> 04:45.590
<b>If you back down now,</b>

04:46.810 --> 04:49.030
<b>I am willing to spare your life.</b>

04:55.030 --> 04:58.890
<b>You'll only spare my life, yes?</b>

05:03.680 --> 05:05.880
<b>Given my position,</b>

05:06.440 --> 05:08.990
<b>I can't accept that offer.</b>

05:19.110 --> 05:21.000
<b>Meanwhile...</b>

05:21.880 --> 05:24.640
<b>In exchange for his agreement to stay still,</b>

05:24.640 --> 05:29.360
<b>Pouf was pressing Pitou to explain 
just what had happened.</b>

05:46.080 --> 05:50.430
<b>Pitou complied with Pouf's request, telling 
him what happened after the attack.</b>

05:50.430 --> 05:53.990
<b>In other words, everything since 
they'd been separated.</b>

05:56.530 --> 06:00.160
<b>Pitou made it a point to include 
details that Gon did not know,</b>

06:00.610 --> 06:05.240
<b>to ensure that Gon's attention would 
be focused on the explanation.</b>

06:07.450 --> 06:11.930
<b>Pitou deliberately did not mention 
how the King had held Komugi</b>

06:12.630 --> 06:17.890
<b>because Pitou did not know how to 
describe the events accurately.</b>

06:26.340 --> 06:29.240
<b>There was no significant change in Gon.</b>

06:31.710 --> 06:32.660
<b>However...</b>

06:34.150 --> 06:39.470
<b>Pitou knew the plan had succeeded 
when Gon's eyes wavered briefly.</b>

06:44.580 --> 06:45.620
<b>The King...</b>

06:47.750 --> 06:52.050
<b>left with the enemy of his own 
volition, by that doorway.</b>

06:52.960 --> 06:55.280
<b>There is no need for us to go.</b>

07:01.030 --> 07:02.310
<b>I see.</b>

07:03.030 --> 07:04.320
<b><i>He went south.</i></b>

07:05.410 --> 07:06.570
<b>I understand.</b>

07:07.620 --> 07:09.620
<b><i>A fine play, Pitou.</i></b>

07:11.720 --> 07:17.530
<b>Then we should await the King's return here.</b>

07:23.510 --> 07:28.830
<b><i>To maintain only my outward appearance, 
I only need one-seventh of my flies.</i></b>

07:32.900 --> 07:35.430
<b><i>The other six-sevenths</i></b>

07:37.330 --> 07:38.720
<b><i>will go to the King!</i></b>

07:54.350 --> 07:56.970
<b>You fight with the resolve to lose?</b>

07:59.170 --> 08:00.750
<b>I do not understand.</b>

08:02.580 --> 08:05.000
<b>You fight for the human race?</b>

08:05.520 --> 08:09.880
<b>If so, then know that my actions 
are, in fact, for their benefit.</b>

08:13.360 --> 08:16.310
<b>For example, in human society,</b>

08:16.310 --> 08:19.700
<b>lands are divided by national borders, 
much like territorial marking.</b>

08:21.340 --> 08:24.380
<b>On the right side of the border, 
children may starve to death.</b>

08:25.600 --> 08:30.050
<b>While on the left, scum who do nothing
have everything they need.</b>

08:31.510 --> 08:33.120
<b>Absolute madness.</b>

08:36.070 --> 08:37.910
<b>I shall crush that madness...</b>

08:39.010 --> 08:41.370
<b>And create a world so fair,</b>

08:41.370 --> 08:46.300
<b>the very concept of inequality will be forgotten!</b>

09:02.410 --> 09:04.180
<b>I concede that</b>

09:04.180 --> 09:07.950
<b>I will initially use power and terror 
to accomplish my objective.</b>

09:08.320 --> 09:12.820
<b>But I will only do so to the extent 
necessary to maintain order.</b>

09:13.700 --> 09:18.070
<b>I have learned what power 
is meant to be used for.</b>

09:21.600 --> 09:25.440
<b>To protect the weak,</b>

09:26.230 --> 09:28.040
<b>who deserve to live.</b>

09:29.420 --> 09:32.550
<b>Power is not meant to be used 
to torment the defeated!</b>

09:40.450 --> 09:43.190
<b><i>This could be a problem...</i></b>

09:44.830 --> 09:46.750
<b>I shall not fight you.</b>

09:47.920 --> 09:50.710
<b>I agreed to leave the palace</b>

09:52.870 --> 09:55.790
<b>so we could have a free, open discussion.</b>

09:57.350 --> 10:00.160
<b><i>He's wavering...</i></b>

10:02.610 --> 10:03.700
<b>Come closer.</b>

10:05.180 --> 10:07.870
<b><i>Wavering between Ant and human.</i></b>

10:08.880 --> 10:11.220
<b><i>And he hasn't realized</i></b>

10:12.370 --> 10:15.940
<b><i>that those two sides are incompatible.</i></b>

10:18.100 --> 10:19.820
<b><i>And neither one</i></b>

10:20.940 --> 10:22.510
<b><i>is dominant yet.</i></b>

10:25.070 --> 10:29.140
<b><i>But regardless of which side he falls to,</i></b>

10:29.780 --> 10:32.010
<b><i>the outcome won't change.</i></b>

10:37.310 --> 10:38.490
<b><i>We're counting on you.</i></b>

10:38.930 --> 10:41.650
<b><i>You have a single mission.</i></b>

10:42.000 --> 10:45.370
<b><i>The immediate extermination 
of these dangerous creatures.</i></b>

10:46.960 --> 10:50.170
<b><i>There have already been many casualties.</i></b>

10:50.880 --> 10:53.330
<b><i>We will use any means necessary.</i></b>

10:53.330 --> 10:55.880
<b><i>Will that be acceptable?</i></b>

10:56.630 --> 11:00.880
<b><i>Naturally, we have no intention of 
telling the experts how to proceed.</i></b>

11:03.960 --> 11:05.570
<b><i>We simply desire</i></b>

11:05.570 --> 11:10.230
<b><i>those dangerous creatures 
eradicated as swiftly as possible.</i></b>

11:11.400 --> 11:13.110
<b><i>Understood.</i></b>

11:15.110 --> 11:20.860
<b><i>So their goal is to eradicate the Ants, 
leaving the Hunters Association</i></b>

11:21.520 --> 11:23.300
<b><i>to take the blame.</i></b>

11:26.280 --> 11:29.370
<b><i>I must make this fast...</i></b>

11:31.070 --> 11:33.330
<b><i>Before my heart is swayed.</i></b>

11:39.600 --> 11:40.970
<b>King...</b>

11:42.030 --> 11:44.280
<b>We are both in difficult positions.</b>

12:51.200 --> 12:55.960
<b>100-Type Guanyin Bodhisattva</b>

12:54.000 --> 12:55.960
<b><i>100-Type Guanyin Bodhisattva!</i></b>

12:58.670 --> 13:01.460
<b>First Hand</b>

12:58.960 --> 13:00.770
<b>First Hand!</b>

13:32.260 --> 13:33.260
<b>That's...</b>

13:38.830 --> 13:41.950
<b>I can't sense anyone else fighting.</b>

13:42.310 --> 13:44.410
<b>Does that mean I'm the only one left?</b>

13:46.430 --> 13:47.440
<b>Youpi!</b>

13:50.410 --> 13:51.440
<b>Pouf!</b>

13:51.890 --> 13:54.480
<b>You've changed a lot since I last saw you.</b>

13:55.260 --> 13:57.800
<b>I could say the same to you.</b>

13:59.980 --> 14:03.890
<b>I had to escape without alerting the enemy.</b>

14:05.250 --> 14:08.940
<b>And if I move all my dispersed particles 
at once, it's too conspicuous.</b>

14:08.940 --> 14:10.040
<b>So I must go slowly.</b>

14:11.790 --> 14:15.290
<b>I'm sure you're feeling impatient, 
but please spare me a moment.</b>

14:16.230 --> 14:18.270
<b>I need to tell you what's happening.</b>

14:21.460 --> 14:26.920
<b>Well, I suppose you have your own concerns...</b>

14:31.150 --> 14:33.190
<b>You've grown up.</b>

14:39.600 --> 14:41.780
<b>And there you have it.</b>

14:43.510 --> 14:45.880
<b>I have no conclusive proof</b>

14:47.900 --> 14:52.690
<b>that the change in Pitou will 
actually benefit the King...</b>

15:03.750 --> 15:08.780
<b>Through his own experiences, 
Youpi could understand Pitou's behavior.</b>

15:09.420 --> 15:10.400
<b>Youpi...</b>

15:12.210 --> 15:15.920
<b>What do you think we should do?</b>

15:23.600 --> 15:25.110
<b>This was a test.</b>

15:26.160 --> 15:28.330
<b>Which made it very clear to Youpi</b>

15:28.800 --> 15:35.120
<b>that Pouf was fearful of the subtle changes</b>

15:35.120 --> 15:37.290
<b>Pitou and Youpi had undergone.</b>

15:42.050 --> 15:43.500
<b>A foolish question.</b>

15:58.500 --> 16:00.510
<b>We must go</b>

16:01.570 --> 16:03.310
<b>to the King at once!</b>

16:05.780 --> 16:09.470
<b>And that's all there is to it... Right?</b>

16:10.320 --> 16:12.530
<b>His response was entirely sincere.</b>

16:15.460 --> 16:16.480
<b>Indeed.</b>

16:17.200 --> 16:22.780
<b>He was concerned only with 
leaving as soon as possible.</b>

16:25.520 --> 16:30.280
<b>Because Youpi was feeling the same fear.</b>

17:09.950 --> 17:11.720
<b><i>I'm sure that was a direct hit...</i></b>

17:13.130 --> 17:14.210
<b><i>He's tough!</i></b>

17:18.830 --> 17:20.110
<b>A good attack.</b>

17:21.600 --> 17:23.310
<b>I could not anticipate it.</b>

17:27.930 --> 17:29.390
<b>Are you satisfied now?</b>

17:37.200 --> 17:39.600
<b><i>He still wants me to sit with him?</i></b>

17:42.710 --> 17:44.870
<b><i>I shall not repeat myself.</i></b>

18:08.060 --> 18:10.440
<b>Third Hand</b>

18:08.220 --> 18:09.990
<b><i>Third Hand!</i></b>

18:18.830 --> 18:21.880
<b><i>I can no longer back down!</i></b>

18:35.740 --> 18:39.110
<b>Are you really so eager to die?</b>

18:48.150 --> 18:49.980
<b>From the King's perspective,</b>

18:50.270 --> 18:52.130
<b>the wrath that was unleashed</b>

18:52.130 --> 18:56.360
<b>was no stronger than that 
of a child throwing a fit.</b>

18:57.120 --> 19:02.740
<b>Yet it was violent enough to induce 
Netero to more than double the distance</b>

19:02.740 --> 19:05.520
<b>between the King and him.</b>

19:07.460 --> 19:10.870
<b>It was an insult likened to laughing off</b>

19:11.590 --> 19:14.460
<b>Netero's declaration that</b>

19:15.600 --> 19:17.610
<b>he would not back down.</b>

19:22.730 --> 19:23.830
<b>Come on...</b>

19:25.000 --> 19:30.260
<b>You will only influence me by using words.</b>

19:33.120 --> 19:35.270
<b><i>Damned newborn brat.</i></b>

19:38.760 --> 19:42.910
<b><i>If it were that simple, 
I wouldn't have to do this!</i></b>

19:47.960 --> 19:49.010
<b><i>Wait...</i></b>

19:50.840 --> 19:52.480
<b><i>By using...</i></b>

19:52.480 --> 19:53.520
<b><i>words?</i></b>

19:57.810 --> 19:58.990
<b>King...</b>

20:01.280 --> 20:04.350
<b>Would you like to know your name?</b>

20:07.010 --> 20:10.230
<b>How would you know my name?</b>

20:16.610 --> 20:21.260
<b>My subordinates were present at the 
moment of your mother's passing.</b>

20:23.480 --> 20:26.980
<b>She uttered your name with her dying breath.</b>

20:28.310 --> 20:33.360
<b>And my subordinates may have died 
fighting your Royal Guard by now.</b>

20:40.060 --> 20:42.410
<b>Interested in fighting me now?</b>

20:45.980 --> 20:49.750
<b>If you can force me to admit defeat,</b>

20:49.750 --> 20:52.190
<b>I will tell you your name.</b>

20:54.750 --> 20:56.590
<b>Force you to admit defeat</b>

20:56.590 --> 20:59.240
<b>without killing you?</b>

21:03.700 --> 21:06.530
<b>So, similar to a bishop and rook handicap...</b>

21:29.510 --> 21:30.780
<b>No matter.</b>

21:30.780 --> 21:32.980
<b>I shall checkmate you shortly.</b>

21:56.210 --> 22:00.500
<b>The real battle between Netero 
and the King has begun.</b>

23:24.380 --> 23:26.560
<b>Next time: Centipede x And x Memory.</b>

23:26.560 --> 23:29.020
<b>Hey, what do you want to be in your next life?</b>

23:29.020 --> 23:30.460
<b>Uh, what do you want to be?</b>

23:30.460 --> 23:34.140
<b>In my next life, I want to be me, 
and meet you again.</b>

23:34.140 --> 23:35.240
<b>Stupid!</b>
