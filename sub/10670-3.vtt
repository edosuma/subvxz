WEBVTT

00:05.139 --> 00:06.140
>> CAITLYN: To be honest with

00:06.140 --> 00:09.043
you, I can't... see myself

00:09.043 --> 00:10.044
dating, like, women in the

00:10.044 --> 00:10.544
future.

00:10.544 --> 00:11.545
>> ELLA: Wow.

00:11.545 --> 00:12.546
>> CAITLYN: Yeah, I would date a

00:12.546 --> 00:14.148
man-- and it's kind of nice just

00:14.148 --> 00:15.616
to get that kind of off your

00:15.616 --> 00:17.818
chest.

00:17.818 --> 00:19.420
>> CANDIS: Like, I moved out

00:19.420 --> 00:21.922
here with a guy, and then when

00:21.922 --> 00:24.392
things got rough, he... was

00:24.392 --> 00:25.393
abusing.

00:25.393 --> 00:27.461
Your pool of men, it

00:27.461 --> 00:29.197
gets thinner as you... once you

00:29.197 --> 00:30.898
tell them that you're... you're

00:30.898 --> 00:31.965
trans.

00:31.965 --> 00:34.034
Like, I've failed relationship

00:34.034 --> 00:35.469
after failed relationship,

00:35.469 --> 00:38.939
and I can't figure out why.

00:38.939 --> 00:39.607
>> CANDIS: He's cute.

00:39.607 --> 00:41.209
>> CHANDI: Gorgeous.

00:41.209 --> 00:42.210
>> ZACKARY: Miss Candis has a

00:42.210 --> 00:43.211
date tonight.

00:43.211 --> 00:44.778
>> CANDIS: I'm alone, waiting

00:44.778 --> 00:46.314
for somebody with a drink,

00:46.314 --> 00:49.550
and nobody's showing up.

00:49.550 --> 00:50.551
>> CAITLYN: I got to go back to

00:50.551 --> 00:51.685
New York to get the Glamour

00:51.685 --> 00:52.786
Woman of The Year Award.

00:52.786 --> 00:53.787
>> PEOPLE: Caitlyn!

00:53.787 --> 00:54.788
Kylie was supposed to be my

00:54.788 --> 00:57.591
date, but she's had a wardrobe

00:57.591 --> 00:59.026
malfunction.

00:59.026 --> 01:00.594
>> KYLIE: My vagina was out.

01:00.594 --> 01:02.996
Not my boob, my vagina.

01:02.996 --> 01:05.299
(people whooping, shouting)

01:05.299 --> 01:06.867
>> CHANDI: It has been so long

01:06.867 --> 01:08.336
since I have performed,

01:08.336 --> 01:10.871
so I am a little nervous.

01:10.871 --> 01:14.242
>> PEOPLE: Chandelier!

01:14.242 --> 01:16.210
*

01:31.159 --> 01:32.426
(footsteps approaching)

01:32.426 --> 01:33.427
>> ELLA (singsongy): Hello.

01:33.427 --> 01:33.927
>> CANDIS: Hi!

01:33.927 --> 01:34.928
>> ELLA: Good morning.

01:34.928 --> 01:35.596
>> CANDIS: Good morning.

01:35.596 --> 01:36.597
>> ELLA: We're in winter

01:36.597 --> 01:37.231
wonderland this morning.

01:37.231 --> 01:38.232
>> CANDIS: I know.

01:38.232 --> 01:39.333
Full snowstorm in New Mexico.

01:39.333 --> 01:40.334
>> ELLA: Yeah.

01:40.334 --> 01:42.370
>> CANDIS (laughs): Of course.

01:42.370 --> 01:43.804
>> KATE: This is like home in

01:43.804 --> 01:45.506
New York. This is fine.

01:45.506 --> 01:48.742
I'm good with this.

01:48.742 --> 01:49.743
>> CAITLYN: Breakfast!

01:49.743 --> 01:50.778
>> ELLA: Good morning.

01:50.778 --> 01:52.746
(indistinct chatter)

01:52.746 --> 01:53.781
>> CHANDI: Morning.

01:53.781 --> 01:55.216
>> ZACKARY: Great.

01:55.216 --> 01:56.817
I believe Miss Candis Cayne has

01:56.817 --> 01:58.386
a date tonight.

01:58.386 --> 02:01.489
(others gasp, chatter)

02:01.489 --> 02:02.490
>> CANDIS: Tonight?

02:02.490 --> 02:03.491
>> ZACKARY: Tonight.

02:03.491 --> 02:04.658
I took the liberty

02:04.658 --> 02:06.860
of creating a profile.

02:06.860 --> 02:07.861
>> CANDIS: Mm-hm.

02:07.861 --> 02:08.862
>> ZACKARY: I just wanted to

02:08.862 --> 02:11.399
make an announcement that we've

02:11.399 --> 02:13.301
succeeded... finding a date for

02:13.301 --> 02:14.302
Candis Cayne.

02:14.302 --> 02:15.303
>> CHANDI: Go, CC.

02:15.303 --> 02:16.470
So, what's your type, Candis?

02:16.470 --> 02:17.471
>> CANDIS: The A type.

02:17.471 --> 02:18.472
>> CAITLYN: A pulse.

02:18.472 --> 02:19.473
>> CHANDI: So you're looking for

02:19.473 --> 02:20.774
tall, dark and handsome?

02:20.774 --> 02:22.276
(Caitlyn laughs)

02:22.276 --> 02:23.277
>> CAITLYN: I can't believe that

02:23.277 --> 02:25.045
even Candis, an absolutely

02:25.045 --> 02:26.647
gorgeous woman, has to do online

02:26.647 --> 02:28.081
dating.

02:28.081 --> 02:30.017
I've never realized, or

02:30.017 --> 02:32.920
certainly have experienced, the

02:32.920 --> 02:34.522
issues, uh, when it comes to

02:34.522 --> 02:35.823
trans women dating.

02:35.823 --> 02:37.124
Uh, Candis has been out there

02:37.124 --> 02:38.726
for a long time, uh, never been

02:38.726 --> 02:39.927
married but had some very long

02:39.927 --> 02:41.229
relationships.

02:41.229 --> 02:42.230
But right now, she doesn't.

02:42.230 --> 02:43.231
She's kind of footloose and

02:43.231 --> 02:45.233
fancy free, so, if that's really

02:45.233 --> 02:46.334
important to her, hey, Candis,

02:46.334 --> 02:47.335
go for it.

02:47.335 --> 02:48.336
>> CANDIS: I'm disillusioned

02:48.336 --> 02:49.337
with it all.

02:49.337 --> 02:50.904
>> Are you not excited?

02:50.904 --> 02:52.840
>> CANDIS: Uh, not really.

02:52.840 --> 02:53.841
>> CAITLYN: After the

02:53.841 --> 02:54.608
stimulating conversation we've

02:54.608 --> 02:55.142
had over politics...

02:55.142 --> 02:56.143
>> CANDIS: Yes!

02:56.143 --> 02:57.144
>> CAITLYN: ...that would be

02:57.144 --> 02:57.645
like nothing!

02:57.645 --> 02:58.646
>> CANDIS: That would be

02:58.646 --> 02:59.146
nothing!

02:59.146 --> 03:00.248
It would be like sleeping.

03:00.248 --> 03:01.249
>> JENNY: You might find it more

03:01.249 --> 03:02.783
of a relief.

03:02.783 --> 03:04.252
>> CANDIS: I have to say that my

03:04.252 --> 03:06.254
online dating experience so

03:06.254 --> 03:08.356
far has been dismal.

03:08.356 --> 03:10.591
I don't go out to clubs, I don't

03:10.591 --> 03:12.560
really do anything but work or

03:12.560 --> 03:14.895
go home, and so I thought online

03:14.895 --> 03:16.730
dating would be a good way to

03:16.730 --> 03:18.899
meet guys and meet somebody that

03:18.899 --> 03:20.734
I'm compatible with, that I

03:20.734 --> 03:21.269
like.

03:21.269 --> 03:22.436
>> CAITLYN: We got a couple

03:22.436 --> 03:24.638
things to open here, and it's

03:24.638 --> 03:27.107
extraordinarily significant.

03:27.107 --> 03:28.141
>> Drumroll, please.

03:28.141 --> 03:29.142
>> CAITLYN: Drumroll!

03:29.142 --> 03:30.678
(drumming on table)

03:30.678 --> 03:32.380
Everybody ready!

03:32.380 --> 03:34.582
Whoa...

03:34.582 --> 03:36.384
Whoa!

03:36.384 --> 03:37.985
>> CHANDI: It's official!

03:37.985 --> 03:41.455
(cheering, clapping, whooping)

03:41.455 --> 03:44.091
>> CANDIS: We're legal!

03:44.091 --> 03:45.092
>> JENNY: Wow.

03:45.092 --> 03:46.093
>> CAITLYN: In the trans

03:46.093 --> 03:47.728
community, proper identification

03:47.728 --> 03:49.963
is a big issue.

03:49.963 --> 03:52.065
To get a job, to travel.

03:52.065 --> 03:54.302
I cannot believe you came all

03:54.302 --> 03:57.338
the way down here, early in the

03:57.338 --> 03:59.673
morning, to support me.

03:59.673 --> 04:00.874
>> KIM: Do you understand how

04:00.874 --> 04:04.978
important a... DMV photo is?

04:04.978 --> 04:06.414
>> KOURTNEY: Hey, guys.

04:06.414 --> 04:07.415
>> CAITLYN: You're here for the

04:07.415 --> 04:08.416
big day!

04:08.416 --> 04:09.550
Okay, guys, we got the picture.

04:09.550 --> 04:10.551
>> KIM: I need to add some

04:10.551 --> 04:11.819
good lighting and light you the

04:11.819 --> 04:13.053
right way.

04:13.053 --> 04:14.054
>> KOURTNEY: Yeah, baby.

04:14.054 --> 04:16.056
>> KIM: Look straight ahead.

04:16.056 --> 04:18.659
>> KOURTNEY: Congratulations!

04:18.659 --> 04:20.227
>> KIM: Congrats.

04:20.227 --> 04:22.330
>> CAITLYN: For Kourtney and Kim

04:22.330 --> 04:24.332
to come in to kind of be at my

04:24.332 --> 04:26.334
side, and to have that process

04:26.334 --> 04:28.402
done for me was really

04:28.402 --> 04:29.403
important.

04:29.403 --> 04:31.204
The picture came out great!

04:31.204 --> 04:34.408
(sniffles) Yeah. Yeah, that's...

04:34.408 --> 04:36.143
You know what?

04:36.143 --> 04:37.645
You know what, I noticed it when

04:37.645 --> 04:39.012
my social security card came

04:39.012 --> 04:40.481
through.

04:40.481 --> 04:43.784
It's almost, like, a whole part

04:43.784 --> 04:45.118
of my life.

04:45.118 --> 04:46.420
Like kind of throwing old

04:46.420 --> 04:49.357
Bruce... out the door.

04:53.260 --> 04:54.728
You know, he was a very good

04:54.728 --> 04:56.430
person.

04:56.430 --> 04:58.399
*

05:02.403 --> 05:03.704
(choked up): Did a lot of good

05:03.704 --> 05:05.773
things in his life.

05:08.676 --> 05:09.843
And sometimes I feel like maybe

05:09.843 --> 05:13.781
he didn't deserve to be... gone.

05:13.781 --> 05:15.383
And I probably held that in for

05:15.383 --> 05:16.917
a long time.

05:16.917 --> 05:18.285
But at some point in your life,

05:18.285 --> 05:19.653
after all of the other things

05:19.653 --> 05:20.888
you're... you gotta say, "Aw,

05:20.888 --> 05:22.390
(bleep), I gotta move forward."

05:22.390 --> 05:23.991
>> CHANDI: Yes.

05:23.991 --> 05:26.226
>> CAITLYN: And, uh...

05:26.226 --> 05:27.861
it's not that I ever wanted to

05:27.861 --> 05:30.263
throw him away... (sniffles)

05:30.263 --> 05:33.401
but, uh... anyway, it's just a

05:33.401 --> 05:34.768
significant... you know?

05:34.768 --> 05:36.737
You look at this, and not only

05:36.737 --> 05:38.071
done a gender marker, name's

05:38.071 --> 05:39.407
changed, the picture's changed,

05:39.407 --> 05:40.574
all that sort of stuff-- it's a

05:40.574 --> 05:42.410
totally... different person.

05:42.410 --> 05:43.811
>> CHANDI: Mm-hmm.

05:43.811 --> 05:45.278
>> CAITLYN: And certainly not

05:45.278 --> 05:46.880
that that old person was a bad

05:46.880 --> 05:48.048
person, just wasn't me.

05:48.048 --> 05:49.049
>> CHANDI: Right.

05:49.049 --> 05:50.050
>> CAITLYN: So when you see

05:50.050 --> 05:52.753
this... pretty significant.

05:52.753 --> 05:54.588
You know? Yeah.

05:54.588 --> 05:55.589
>> CHANDI: Congratulations.

05:55.589 --> 05:56.590
>> OTHERS: Congratulations.

05:56.590 --> 05:57.891
>> CAITLYN: Well, thank you.

05:57.891 --> 06:00.093
It is kind of symbolic that I

06:00.093 --> 06:01.929
get my driver's license a couple

06:01.929 --> 06:04.565
of days before, uh, I have to

06:04.565 --> 06:05.833
fly to New York to get Glamour's

06:05.833 --> 06:07.568
Woman of the Year Award.

06:07.568 --> 06:09.770
Which, to me, is, unbelievable.

06:09.770 --> 06:11.204
So I'd like to take, in the

06:11.204 --> 06:12.840
future, all the great qualities

06:12.840 --> 06:16.309
that he had, and, um, put him

06:16.309 --> 06:18.311
into her, and move forward.

06:18.311 --> 06:21.014
Remember, this award is for all

06:21.014 --> 06:23.083
of us, it's not just about me,

06:23.083 --> 06:25.085
that is for sure.

06:31.759 --> 06:32.760
(indistinct chatter)

06:32.760 --> 06:33.761
>> WAITER: Hi, ladies.

06:33.761 --> 06:34.762
>> ZACKARY: Hi.

06:34.762 --> 06:36.664
>> WAITER: Some tequila?

06:36.664 --> 06:38.599
>> ZACKARY: Why not? Thank you.

06:38.599 --> 06:39.800
>> KATE: Excuse me.

06:39.800 --> 06:40.801
She certainly would.

06:40.801 --> 06:41.802
>> CHANDI: Oh, absolutely.

06:41.802 --> 06:42.302
Thank you.

06:42.302 --> 06:43.671
>> KATE: Thank you.

06:43.671 --> 06:45.473
>> CANDIS: So he's, like,

06:45.473 --> 06:47.475
meeting me here in, like,

06:47.475 --> 06:48.609
20 minutes.

06:48.609 --> 06:49.743
>> ZACKARY: Uh-huh.

06:49.743 --> 06:51.579
You need more moral support?

06:51.579 --> 06:52.580
You know what to do.

06:52.580 --> 06:53.747
>> CANDIS: You would think, but

06:53.747 --> 06:54.748
I don't know.

06:54.748 --> 06:55.783
>> ZACKARY: Yeah. (laughs)

06:55.783 --> 06:57.651
*

06:57.651 --> 06:58.652
>> CAITLYN: Where's the picture

06:58.652 --> 06:59.653
of this guy?

06:59.653 --> 07:01.489
You gotta be hard to get, girl.

07:01.489 --> 07:02.890
Your biggest problem is, you

07:02.890 --> 07:04.892
gotta get this guy past me.

07:04.892 --> 07:06.527
You know?

07:06.527 --> 07:07.661
And so... I'm watching.

07:07.661 --> 07:08.662
>> CANDIS: That might be kind of

07:08.662 --> 07:10.531
awkward with the... (laughs)

07:10.531 --> 07:11.765
>> CAITLYN: I've never been, in

07:11.765 --> 07:13.400
my entire life, a, like, a big

07:13.400 --> 07:15.102
dater, like I was going out all

07:15.102 --> 07:16.103
the time.

07:16.103 --> 07:17.638
So for me in the future,

07:17.638 --> 07:20.407
dating as a trans woman, I don't

07:20.407 --> 07:22.409
see myself, like, obsessed, with

07:22.409 --> 07:23.677
something like that.

07:23.677 --> 07:25.345
I see the girls being rejected

07:25.345 --> 07:27.014
a lot, when it comes to dating,

07:27.014 --> 07:28.516
and I don't want that in my

07:28.516 --> 07:29.517
life.

07:29.517 --> 07:30.718
And so yeah, the rejection

07:30.718 --> 07:33.020
thing kind of scares me.

07:33.020 --> 07:34.254
>> CANDIS: I keep on looking at

07:34.254 --> 07:35.255
that door.

07:35.255 --> 07:36.256
>> CHANDI: Why aren't you just

07:36.256 --> 07:37.525
sitting at the bar?

07:37.525 --> 07:38.058
What time is he coming?

07:38.058 --> 07:39.059
>> CANDIS: I should be sitting

07:39.059 --> 07:39.593
at the bar, waiting.

07:39.593 --> 07:40.594
>> CHANDI: Yeah. Yeah.

07:40.594 --> 07:41.595
>> CANDIS: I think I'm gonna go

07:41.595 --> 07:42.930
find a seat somewhere and wait

07:42.930 --> 07:44.197
for him to arrive.

07:44.197 --> 07:45.198
>> WOMAN: Where is he?

07:45.198 --> 07:46.534
>> CAITLYN: He's ten minutes

07:46.534 --> 07:47.701
late already.

07:47.701 --> 07:49.737
*

07:49.737 --> 07:51.705
(indistinct chatter)

08:00.881 --> 08:02.149
>> CANDIS: Honestly, I feel kind

08:02.149 --> 08:03.617
of embarrassed.

08:03.617 --> 08:06.053
I'm alone, waiting for somebody

08:06.053 --> 08:08.088
with a drink, and nobody's

08:08.088 --> 08:09.089
showing up.

08:09.089 --> 08:10.691
It's insulting.

08:10.691 --> 08:12.425
Why am I doing this to myself

08:12.425 --> 08:13.694
again?

08:13.694 --> 08:14.695
>> ZACKARY: Girl.

08:14.695 --> 08:15.696
Oh, yes, honey.

08:15.696 --> 08:16.697
(Candis laughs)

08:16.697 --> 08:18.566
You are a vision.

08:18.566 --> 08:20.267
I just messaged him and said,

08:20.267 --> 08:21.769
"When are you coming by?"

08:21.769 --> 08:22.770
>> CANDIS: And what did he say?

08:22.770 --> 08:23.771
>> ZACKARY: Um, he hasn't

08:23.771 --> 08:24.972
responded yet.

08:24.972 --> 08:26.039
>> CAITLYN: Did he show up?

08:26.039 --> 08:27.040
>> CANDIS: He didn't show up.

08:27.040 --> 08:28.041
>> CAITLYN (laughs): Could you

08:28.041 --> 08:29.042
be stood up?

08:29.042 --> 08:30.978
>> CANDIS: You're laughing?

08:30.978 --> 08:31.979
>> CAITLYN: No, no, no, no...

08:31.979 --> 08:32.713
>> CANDIS: You're laughing.

08:32.713 --> 08:33.714
>> CAITLYN: I'm not laugh...

08:33.714 --> 08:34.281
I'm not laughing.

08:34.281 --> 08:35.282
>> CANDIS: You're totally

08:35.282 --> 08:35.783
laughing.

08:35.783 --> 08:36.784
>> CAITLYN: No, I'm not

08:36.784 --> 08:37.785
laughing.

08:37.785 --> 08:38.786
No.

08:38.786 --> 08:40.120
>> CANDIS: I got stood up.

08:40.120 --> 08:41.589
>> CAITLYN: I would be

08:41.589 --> 08:43.423
devastated.

08:43.423 --> 08:44.925
I think it takes a lot of guts

08:44.925 --> 08:46.259
for Candis to be sitting at the

08:46.259 --> 08:47.861
bar, waiting for this "date" to

08:47.861 --> 08:50.698
show up; it is not easy at all.

08:50.698 --> 08:52.600
I think, for me, at this point,

08:52.600 --> 08:53.734
I-I don't even want to deal with

08:53.734 --> 08:54.234
it.

08:54.234 --> 08:55.235
>> COURTNEY: Was he supposed to

08:55.235 --> 08:56.236
show up at a certain time, or

08:56.236 --> 08:56.737
no?

08:56.737 --> 08:57.738
>> CANDIS: Yeah, and he never

08:57.738 --> 08:58.238
did.

08:58.238 --> 08:59.239
>> CAITLYN: He's a dog!

08:59.239 --> 08:59.740
>> CANDIS: Well...

08:59.740 --> 09:00.808
As most of them are.

09:00.808 --> 09:01.809
>> CAITLYN: We don't like him

09:01.809 --> 09:02.309
already.

09:02.309 --> 09:03.310
>> COURTNEY: Aren't they all?

09:03.310 --> 09:03.811
>> CAITLYN: Yeah.

09:03.811 --> 09:04.812
>> CANDIS: We're in the new

09:04.812 --> 09:05.312
millennium.

09:05.312 --> 09:07.080
I'm sick and tired of men who

09:07.080 --> 09:08.949
feel like they have the

09:08.949 --> 09:11.118
upper hand on trans women.

09:11.118 --> 09:12.119
(bleep) you.

09:12.119 --> 09:12.620
>> CHANDI: Right.

09:12.620 --> 09:13.621
>> CANDIS: I'm sorry.

09:13.621 --> 09:14.622
I'm over it.

09:14.622 --> 09:15.623
>> CAITLYN: I like that

09:15.623 --> 09:16.123
attitude.

09:16.123 --> 09:17.791
I love it when you cuss.

09:17.791 --> 09:19.760
(Candis laughs)

09:21.829 --> 09:24.064
(crickets chirping)

09:24.064 --> 09:25.532
(rooster crowing)

09:25.532 --> 09:27.968
(chickens clucking)

09:27.968 --> 09:29.803
>> CANDIS: Let's go.

09:29.803 --> 09:31.171
>> WOMAN: Have you guys ever

09:31.171 --> 09:32.172
been around chickens before?

09:32.172 --> 09:33.173
>> CANDIS: Yeah.

09:33.173 --> 09:34.174
>> WOMAN: Yeah?

09:34.174 --> 09:36.009
>> CANDIS: Not Silkie chickens.

09:36.009 --> 09:38.712
To help your mind/body

09:38.712 --> 09:40.781
experience healthy living, this

09:40.781 --> 09:43.751
resort does animal therapy.

09:43.751 --> 09:45.085
So we're just gonna pet Silkie

09:45.085 --> 09:45.753
chickens.

09:45.753 --> 09:46.754
>> WOMAN: They're really, really

09:46.754 --> 09:47.755
soft-- it's almost like petting

09:47.755 --> 09:48.756
a cat.

09:48.756 --> 09:49.757
>> CANDIS: Wow.

09:49.757 --> 09:50.758
(chickens clucking)

09:50.758 --> 09:51.258
*

09:51.258 --> 09:52.259
>> WOMAN: Mm-hmm. Come on out.

09:52.259 --> 09:53.260
>> CANDIS: All right.

09:53.260 --> 09:54.862
Oh, my God.

09:54.862 --> 09:57.765
Wow.

09:57.765 --> 09:59.266
>> WOMAN: So, chickens are part

09:59.266 --> 10:01.401
of our animal interaction here,

10:01.401 --> 10:02.602
'cause they've actually shown

10:02.602 --> 10:03.937
that lowers your anxiety and

10:03.937 --> 10:05.005
your stress levels.

10:05.005 --> 10:06.073
Each one has a really

10:06.073 --> 10:07.908
different personality.

10:07.908 --> 10:09.376
>> JENNY: Just like our group of

10:09.376 --> 10:10.377
trans women.

10:10.377 --> 10:11.378
>> PRODUCER: Is there any way

10:11.378 --> 10:13.180
that you could relate the

10:13.180 --> 10:15.783
experience of the chickens to

10:15.783 --> 10:18.085
your dating situation?

10:18.085 --> 10:20.053
(Candis laughs)

10:22.489 --> 10:23.490
>> WOMAN: These guys are

10:23.490 --> 10:25.092
notoriously hard to actually

10:25.092 --> 10:26.593
tell who are boys and girls.

10:26.593 --> 10:28.428
>> JENNY: Story of our life.

10:28.428 --> 10:29.763
>> CANDIS (sighs): Well, it

10:29.763 --> 10:32.365
really got me thinking about

10:32.365 --> 10:33.633
petting cocks.

10:33.633 --> 10:35.602
(laughter)

10:37.771 --> 10:38.772
>> CANDIS: But you should...

10:38.772 --> 10:42.475
(laughing)

10:42.475 --> 10:45.445
(imitating chicken clucking)

10:53.486 --> 10:54.688
>> CAITLYN: Hey, Cayne!

10:54.688 --> 10:55.188
>> CANDIS: Yeah?

10:55.188 --> 10:56.189
>> CAITLYN: Are you ready to get

10:56.189 --> 10:56.690
it down?

10:56.690 --> 10:57.691
>> CANDIS: I am ready.

10:57.691 --> 10:58.692
>> CAITLYN: We are going

10:58.692 --> 10:59.659
dancing, girl.

10:59.659 --> 11:00.894
>> CANDIS: Yes. For our, you

11:00.894 --> 11:02.229
know, two-woman show that we're

11:02.229 --> 11:02.730
gonna do.

11:02.730 --> 11:03.731
(laughter)

11:03.731 --> 11:05.632
>> CAITLYN: I, uh...

11:05.632 --> 11:06.633
(laughter)

11:06.633 --> 11:08.468
>> CANDIS: I really wanted to

11:08.468 --> 11:10.203
have us all go to salsa class,

11:10.203 --> 11:11.739
but mostly Caitlyn, because I

11:11.739 --> 11:13.841
want her to start getting in

11:13.841 --> 11:16.009
touch with her feminine side.

11:16.009 --> 11:17.044
>> CARLOS: Hi, ladies.

11:17.044 --> 11:18.045
>> OTHERS: Hi! Hello!

11:18.045 --> 11:19.412
>> CANDIS: And it would be a

11:19.412 --> 11:21.281
bonus if there are some really

11:21.281 --> 11:22.783
cute guys there.

11:22.783 --> 11:24.017
>> CARLOS: My name is Carlos

11:24.017 --> 11:25.418
Mora, and I'm gonna be the

11:25.418 --> 11:27.054
instructor today, and I will

11:27.054 --> 11:28.756
explain to you the steps of

11:28.756 --> 11:29.757
salsa which are very, very

11:29.757 --> 11:31.224
simple, and then we'll just line

11:31.224 --> 11:33.193
up in couples.

11:33.193 --> 11:34.527
Okay, so we're gonna start the

11:34.527 --> 11:35.028
class.

11:35.028 --> 11:36.029
Can anybody tell me when salsa

11:36.029 --> 11:36.596
dancing was invented?

11:36.596 --> 11:37.597
>> CAITLYN: I think we're being

11:37.597 --> 11:39.566
set up here.

11:41.869 --> 11:43.103
I am not comfortable with doing

11:43.103 --> 11:43.603
this.

11:43.603 --> 11:44.604
>> CANDIS: With what?

11:44.604 --> 11:45.605
>> CAITLYN: Having a bunch of

11:45.605 --> 11:47.040
guys here so we dance with

11:47.040 --> 11:48.308
guys.

11:48.308 --> 11:49.542
>> CANDIS: Whatever makes you

11:49.542 --> 11:50.577
feel comfortable.

11:50.577 --> 11:51.578
>> CAITLYN: That ain't

11:51.578 --> 11:52.079
happening.

11:52.079 --> 11:53.080
That picture is going to go all

11:53.080 --> 11:54.414
over the world, and I don't want

11:54.414 --> 11:58.085
my kids to see that.

11:58.085 --> 11:59.152
>> CANDIS: I lost my appetite

11:59.152 --> 12:00.153
when that went down.

12:00.153 --> 12:01.221
I was like, ugh!

12:01.221 --> 12:02.289
>> CHANDI: Oh, well...

12:02.289 --> 12:03.791
>> CANDIS: The restaurant owner

12:03.791 --> 12:05.292
didn't want us there.

12:05.292 --> 12:06.794
He found out what show it was

12:06.794 --> 12:09.062
for, and he said, "No, you can't

12:09.062 --> 12:11.865
film here anymore."

12:11.865 --> 12:14.968
What is holding you back from...

12:14.968 --> 12:15.969
just going on a date with

12:15.969 --> 12:16.469
someone?

12:16.469 --> 12:17.470
>> CAITLYN: Thought about

12:17.470 --> 12:19.306
bringing up to Kylie, "I should

12:19.306 --> 12:20.373
start dating or doing something

12:20.373 --> 12:21.374
like that."

12:21.374 --> 12:22.810
I just, I-I can't even bring the

12:22.810 --> 12:24.711
subject up.

12:26.814 --> 12:28.415
*

12:28.415 --> 12:29.416
>> CAITLYN: I am not comfortable

12:29.416 --> 12:30.417
with doing this.

12:30.417 --> 12:31.418
>> CANDIS: With what?

12:31.418 --> 12:32.419
>> CAITLYN: Having a bunch of

12:32.419 --> 12:33.420
guys here so we dance with

12:33.420 --> 12:34.421
guys.

12:34.421 --> 12:36.089
>> CANDIS: Whatever makes you

12:36.089 --> 12:37.257
feel comfortable.

12:37.257 --> 12:38.258
>> CAITLYN: That ain't

12:38.258 --> 12:38.826
happening.

12:38.826 --> 12:39.827
That picture is going to go all

12:39.827 --> 12:40.894
over the world, and I don't want

12:40.894 --> 12:43.931
my kids to see that.

12:43.931 --> 12:45.565
>> CANDIS: Honestly, Caitlyn

12:45.565 --> 12:48.035
hasn't really embraced those

12:48.035 --> 12:50.737
sides of her feminine self yet.

12:50.737 --> 12:52.172
But this isn't like speed

12:52.172 --> 12:54.307
dating, this is a dance class,

12:54.307 --> 12:55.408
we're doing salsa, and that's

12:55.408 --> 12:57.077
usually pretty normal to have

12:57.077 --> 12:59.046
male dancers.

13:01.148 --> 13:02.149
>> CAITLYN: Which way do we

13:02.149 --> 13:03.150
start with?

13:03.150 --> 13:04.151
Which way do we start?

13:04.151 --> 13:04.651
>> CANDIS: Um...

13:04.651 --> 13:05.652
>> CAITLYN: Is it this way or am

13:05.652 --> 13:06.153
I that way?

13:06.153 --> 13:07.154
>> CANDIS: It's this way, yeah.

13:07.154 --> 13:08.155
>> CARLOS: ...and five, six,

13:08.155 --> 13:09.156
seven.

13:09.156 --> 13:11.258
And one, two, three...

13:11.258 --> 13:12.259
and five, six, seven.

13:12.259 --> 13:13.260
>> CAITLYN: Come on, I can

13:13.260 --> 13:14.261
shake it just as good as you

13:14.261 --> 13:15.262
can.

13:15.262 --> 13:18.365
(salsa beat playing)

13:18.365 --> 13:21.034
I was too busy on shaking it.

13:21.034 --> 13:22.269
First of all, who wouldn't want

13:22.269 --> 13:23.203
to dance with Candis?

13:23.203 --> 13:24.637
She's a great dancer, great,

13:24.637 --> 13:26.206
perfect.

13:26.206 --> 13:27.875
*

13:27.875 --> 13:28.876
(indistinct chatter)

13:28.876 --> 13:31.411
(Candis laughs)

13:31.411 --> 13:32.679
>> CAITLYN: I was too back on my

13:32.679 --> 13:33.947
heel.

13:33.947 --> 13:34.948
(Caitlyn groans)

13:34.948 --> 13:36.116
I just feel uncomfortable,

13:36.116 --> 13:37.450
especially if you get some guy

13:37.450 --> 13:39.719
who I don't know who the heck he

13:39.719 --> 13:40.720
is.

13:40.720 --> 13:42.489
I am just not ready to put

13:42.489 --> 13:43.590
myself out there.

13:43.590 --> 13:45.192
I'm gonna stick with Candis.

13:45.192 --> 13:46.359
>> CARLOS: Rotate.

13:46.359 --> 13:47.360
(music pauses)

13:47.360 --> 13:48.361
>> CAITLYN: We're not rotating.

13:48.361 --> 13:49.362
(Candis laughs)

13:49.362 --> 13:50.363
>> CARLOS: Thank you very much.

13:50.363 --> 13:51.364
>> CAITLYN: Thank you!

13:51.364 --> 13:53.800
(cheering, whooping)

13:53.800 --> 13:54.301
That was fun.

13:54.301 --> 13:55.302
>> CANDIS: You did it.

13:55.302 --> 13:55.903
That was so much fun.

13:55.903 --> 13:57.905
>> CAITLYN: That was fun.

14:00.273 --> 14:02.309
(crickets chirping)

14:04.945 --> 14:06.046
>> COURTNEY: I think I'm ready.

14:06.046 --> 14:07.047
>> CAITLYN: First commercial

14:07.047 --> 14:08.115
road trip.

14:08.115 --> 14:09.816
(gasps) God, it's great!

14:09.816 --> 14:10.817
>> KIP: You get to use your

14:10.817 --> 14:11.818
driver's license for the first

14:11.818 --> 14:12.319
time.

14:12.319 --> 14:13.320
>> CAITLYN: All those people,

14:13.320 --> 14:13.987
all those people, yeah.

14:13.987 --> 14:14.988
>> COURTNEY: You have your

14:14.988 --> 14:15.488
license?

14:15.488 --> 14:16.489
>> CAITLYN: Oh, I got it.

14:16.489 --> 14:17.490
>> COURTNEY: Okay.

14:17.490 --> 14:17.991
Just making sure.

14:17.991 --> 14:18.992
>> CAITLYN: All right.

14:18.992 --> 14:19.993
I got to leave the trip.

14:19.993 --> 14:21.161
I got to go back to New York to

14:21.161 --> 14:22.362
get the Glamour Woman of the

14:22.362 --> 14:22.930
Year Award.

14:22.930 --> 14:23.931
>> JENNY: Have a great journey.

14:23.931 --> 14:24.932
You're gonna be great.

14:24.932 --> 14:25.933
>> CAITLYN: Thank you.

14:25.933 --> 14:26.934
Okay. I'll get through it,

14:26.934 --> 14:27.534
I promise you.

14:27.534 --> 14:28.768
>> JENNY: You're gonna be great.

14:28.768 --> 14:29.937
>> CAITLYN: I'll represent.

14:29.937 --> 14:31.771
I'm quite nervous about this.

14:31.771 --> 14:33.006
Kylie's gonna meet me in New

14:33.006 --> 14:34.942
York-- she's my date.

14:34.942 --> 14:35.943
It's a really big deal.

14:35.943 --> 14:36.944
>> JENNY: You'll do well, and

14:36.944 --> 14:37.777
we'll... we'll be here for you

14:37.777 --> 14:38.645
>> CAITLYN: I appreciate it.

14:38.645 --> 14:39.646
>> JENNY: ...when you come back.

14:39.646 --> 14:40.647
>> CAITLYN: Oh, don't worry,

14:40.647 --> 14:41.748
I'll find you in Chicago.

14:41.748 --> 14:42.749
>> JENNY: Good.

14:42.749 --> 14:44.717
>> CAITLYN: Okay.

14:46.786 --> 14:47.787
(train whistle blowing in

14:47.787 --> 14:50.790
distance)

14:50.790 --> 14:51.791
>> CHANDI: So, Jason, where we

14:51.791 --> 14:52.792
headed to?

14:52.792 --> 14:53.793
>> JASON: Into Tulsa.

14:53.793 --> 14:55.095
>> CHANDI: Tulsa?

14:55.095 --> 14:56.529
Tulsa, Oklahoma?

14:56.529 --> 14:57.764
>> ELLA: The trans guy, I don't

14:57.764 --> 14:58.765
know if guys you're familiar,

14:58.765 --> 15:01.034
Arin Andrews, lives there.

15:01.034 --> 15:02.735
He was on Barney's with his...

15:02.735 --> 15:03.736
>> KATE: The fashion spread.

15:03.736 --> 15:04.972
>> ELLA: Yeah.

15:04.972 --> 15:07.307
And he's really (bleep) cute.

15:07.307 --> 15:08.541
(laughter)

15:08.541 --> 15:09.876
>> CHANDI: Oh, we love it!

15:09.876 --> 15:10.877
>> CANDIS: Hella.

15:10.877 --> 15:11.878
>> CHANDI: Yeah.

15:11.878 --> 15:12.980
>> JENNY: Well, if we can figure

15:12.980 --> 15:13.981
it out, you should definitely

15:13.981 --> 15:14.982
hang out with him.

15:14.982 --> 15:15.548
That would be great.

15:15.548 --> 15:16.816
>> That would be awesome.

15:16.816 --> 15:18.751
*

15:18.751 --> 15:20.287
>> CANDIS: I'm super excited,

15:20.287 --> 15:21.989
really, to go to Chicago, to see

15:21.989 --> 15:23.356
Mimi.

15:23.356 --> 15:25.425
She's one of my best friends.

15:25.425 --> 15:27.627
She's a showgirl.

15:27.627 --> 15:29.529
She's been working at the Baton

15:29.529 --> 15:30.797
for, like, 25 years.

15:30.797 --> 15:31.798
>> CHANDI: Nothing like a good

15:31.798 --> 15:32.799
drag show.

15:32.799 --> 15:33.300
>> CANDIS: Yeah.

15:33.300 --> 15:35.335
>> CHANDI: All the rigmarole

15:35.335 --> 15:36.403
and kinky things that go on...

15:36.403 --> 15:38.138
>> CANDIS: Yes.

15:38.138 --> 15:39.272
>> CHANDI: ...back there, I

15:39.272 --> 15:40.573
really miss those days.

15:40.573 --> 15:41.641
>> CANDIS: I was thinking that

15:41.641 --> 15:42.842
maybe we can go and see her at

15:42.842 --> 15:44.011
the Baton.

15:44.011 --> 15:45.078
Maybe I would do a number with

15:45.078 --> 15:46.879
her and Chandi.

15:46.879 --> 15:49.549
>> KATE (gasps): Oh... oh, yes,

15:49.549 --> 15:50.550
please.

15:50.550 --> 15:51.551
>> CHANDI: No. I'm here to

15:51.551 --> 15:52.552
support you girls.

15:52.552 --> 15:54.021
>> CANDIS: I know, but you were

15:54.021 --> 15:55.655
saying you were kind of missing

15:55.655 --> 15:57.457
the old Chandelier days.

15:57.457 --> 15:59.026
>> ELLA: You used to do drag?

15:59.026 --> 15:59.459
>> CHANDI: I did!

15:59.459 --> 16:00.460
>> ELLA: Oh, my goodness!

16:00.460 --> 16:01.628
>> CHANDI: I used to.

16:01.628 --> 16:03.363
I think about those days a lot.

16:03.363 --> 16:05.932
And I would love to perform

16:05.932 --> 16:07.567
again someday soon.

16:07.567 --> 16:09.902
Performing is such a great

16:09.902 --> 16:11.604
outlet for me.

16:11.604 --> 16:13.573
Not all performers are men.

16:13.573 --> 16:14.941
Just like Candis Cayne.

16:14.941 --> 16:16.676
She's a trans woman who likes to

16:16.676 --> 16:18.811
perform and entertain.

16:18.811 --> 16:20.180
I feel such happiness when I'm

16:20.180 --> 16:22.549
on that stage, shining, getting

16:22.549 --> 16:23.550
my life.

16:23.550 --> 16:24.551
>> ELLA: I've never been to a

16:24.551 --> 16:25.552
drag show.

16:25.552 --> 16:26.553
>> CHANDI: Oh, my goodness, you

16:26.553 --> 16:29.156
are in store for a treat.

16:36.663 --> 16:38.231
>> CANDIS: Who's hungry?

16:38.231 --> 16:39.532
>> CHANDI: Oh, this is perfectly

16:39.532 --> 16:41.501
okay.

16:46.939 --> 16:48.308
>> CANDIS: We're almost to

16:48.308 --> 16:49.709
Texas, and what just happened in

16:49.709 --> 16:50.743
here in this restaurant?

16:50.743 --> 16:51.744
>> CHANDI: They wouldn't allow

16:51.744 --> 16:53.146
us in here, which is horrible

16:53.146 --> 16:55.548
for them, because, um, you know,

16:55.548 --> 16:56.883
a lot of people see this show,

16:56.883 --> 16:58.585
so it would be some good

16:58.585 --> 16:59.586
promotion for them.

16:59.586 --> 17:00.587
>> CANDIS: I lost my appetite

17:00.587 --> 17:01.654
when that went down.

17:01.654 --> 17:02.655
I was like, ugh!

17:02.655 --> 17:04.091
>> CHANDI: Oh, well...

17:04.091 --> 17:05.325
>> CANDIS: But, you know, it is,

17:05.325 --> 17:06.326
what it is.

17:06.326 --> 17:07.660
It is really kind of a bummer

17:07.660 --> 17:09.396
the restaurant owner didn't want

17:09.396 --> 17:11.098
us there.

17:11.098 --> 17:13.433
Um, we were allowed to film, and

17:13.433 --> 17:16.236
then... he found out what show

17:16.236 --> 17:18.638
it was for and he said, "No, you

17:18.638 --> 17:19.639
can't film here anymore," he's

17:19.639 --> 17:20.473
not interested.

17:20.473 --> 17:21.474
We're so used to living in

17:21.474 --> 17:22.008
our... our bubble...

17:22.008 --> 17:23.009
>> CHANDI: Our bubble of

17:23.009 --> 17:23.510
acceptance.

17:23.510 --> 17:24.511
>> CANDIS: ...that everything is

17:24.511 --> 17:25.878
happy and accepting.

17:25.878 --> 17:26.879
>> CHANDI: But this is something

17:26.879 --> 17:27.880
we can look forward to

17:27.880 --> 17:28.881
experiencing, being down this

17:28.881 --> 17:29.382
way, though.

17:29.382 --> 17:30.383
(Candis laughs)

17:30.383 --> 17:32.252
>> CHANDI: In the South.

17:32.252 --> 17:33.753
>> CANDIS: It's a little weird,

17:33.753 --> 17:35.455
you know?

17:35.455 --> 17:37.424
C'est la vie.

17:40.327 --> 17:41.328
>> ARIN: All right, let's do

17:41.328 --> 17:41.828
it.

17:41.828 --> 17:43.663
>> CANDIS: Oh, God.

17:43.663 --> 17:44.897
He's cute,

17:44.897 --> 17:45.865
>> CHANDI: Gorgeous.

17:45.865 --> 17:46.933
>> CANDIS: I know, right?

17:46.933 --> 17:48.168
>> CHANDI: Laith is getting it

17:48.168 --> 17:51.138
in!

17:51.138 --> 17:52.505
>> CAITLYN: Kylie says she's

17:52.505 --> 17:54.141
coming, but we'll see.

17:54.141 --> 17:55.842
She hasn't made it here yet.

17:55.842 --> 17:57.310
So I got to do the red carpet

17:57.310 --> 17:59.146
all by myself, and to be honest

17:59.146 --> 18:00.647
with you, that is very scary.

18:00.647 --> 18:02.715
>> PEOPLE: Caitlyn! Caitlyn!

18:04.151 --> 18:07.053
(birds chirping)

18:07.053 --> 18:08.821
>> CHANDI: What's going on?

18:08.821 --> 18:10.056
You're on speaker now, Mom.

18:10.056 --> 18:11.057
We're in the van.

18:11.057 --> 18:11.591
>> CANDIS: Hi, Mom.

18:11.591 --> 18:12.592
>> CHANDI'S MOM: Oh, okay.

18:12.592 --> 18:13.593
>> CHANDI: There's Candis, and

18:13.593 --> 18:15.428
there's Ella, JB's up there,

18:15.428 --> 18:15.928
too.

18:15.928 --> 18:16.929
>> CHANDI'S MOM: Hello to all of

18:16.929 --> 18:17.930
you guys.

18:17.930 --> 18:18.931
Where you going now?

18:18.931 --> 18:19.932
>> CHANDI: We're on our way rock

18:19.932 --> 18:20.433
climbing.

18:20.433 --> 18:21.434
>> CHANDI'S MOM: Now, you be

18:21.434 --> 18:22.435
careful climbing rocks, 'cause,

18:22.435 --> 18:23.436
you know, you're not a little

18:23.436 --> 18:24.171
person, you know.

18:24.171 --> 18:26.739
(laughter)

18:26.739 --> 18:27.740
>> CHANDI: Oh! Okay.

18:27.740 --> 18:28.741
>> CHANDI'S MOM: You guys take

18:28.741 --> 18:29.742
care. Okay.

18:29.742 --> 18:31.077
>> CHANDI: All right. Bye-bye.

18:31.077 --> 18:32.078
>> CHANDI'S MOM: Bye-bye.

18:32.078 --> 18:33.079
(Candis laughs)

18:33.079 --> 18:35.248
*

18:35.248 --> 18:35.748
>> CANDIS: Hi.

18:35.748 --> 18:36.416
>> LAITH: Hi.

18:36.416 --> 18:37.417
>> CANDIS: How are you? Candis.

18:37.417 --> 18:38.418
>> LAITH: Hi, Candis. Laith.

18:38.418 --> 18:38.918
Nice to meet you.

18:38.918 --> 18:39.919
>> ARIN: Nice to meet you,

18:39.919 --> 18:40.487
Candis. I'm Arin.

18:40.487 --> 18:41.488
>> ELLA: Hi. Ella.

18:41.488 --> 18:42.822
>> LAITH: Nice to meet you.

18:42.822 --> 18:44.491
>> ELLA: So, actually, Arin told

18:44.491 --> 18:46.393
me that Laith Ashley, another

18:46.393 --> 18:47.860
trans guy who he did his

18:47.860 --> 18:49.362
Barney's campaign with, is also

18:49.362 --> 18:50.997
in town, so we're gonna get two

18:50.997 --> 18:55.001
for the price of one, so...

18:55.001 --> 18:56.203
Whoo, whoo!

18:56.203 --> 18:57.204
>> I'm so glad this all worked

18:57.204 --> 18:57.637
out.

18:57.637 --> 18:58.638
>> ARIN: Yeah, absolutely.

18:58.638 --> 18:59.639
>> LAITH: Are you all gonna be

18:59.639 --> 19:00.207
climbing as well?

19:00.207 --> 19:01.208
>> CHANDI: Well, we're all

19:01.208 --> 19:02.209
curious.

19:02.209 --> 19:02.709
(laughter)

19:02.709 --> 19:03.710
>> ARIN: That's safe, that's

19:03.710 --> 19:05.212
safe.

19:05.212 --> 19:07.780
All right, let's do it.

19:07.780 --> 19:08.948
>> CHANDI: Laith is getting it

19:08.948 --> 19:10.082
in!

19:10.082 --> 19:11.284
We need you all the way at the

19:11.284 --> 19:12.919
top, Candis, like Laith.

19:12.919 --> 19:14.587
>> CANDIS: Laith is beefy.

19:14.587 --> 19:15.588
(laughter)

19:15.588 --> 19:16.256
>> LAITH (laughs): Am I?

19:16.256 --> 19:17.790
>> CHANDI: Yes, he is.

19:17.790 --> 19:18.891
>> CANDIS: All right, Ella.

19:18.891 --> 19:19.926
>> ELLA: Oh, God.

19:19.926 --> 19:21.228
>> CANDIS: He's cute.

19:21.228 --> 19:22.229
>> CHANDI: Gorgeous.

19:22.229 --> 19:23.296
>> CANDIS: I know, right?

19:23.296 --> 19:24.697
>> CHANDI: They both are.

19:24.697 --> 19:25.698
>> ARIN: Think you're up.

19:25.698 --> 19:26.699
>> CHANDI: I think so, too,

19:26.699 --> 19:27.734
Arin.

19:27.734 --> 19:28.735
>> CANDIS: You live here?

19:28.735 --> 19:29.869
>> LAITH: Y... No, no, no, I'm

19:29.869 --> 19:30.370
visiting Arin.

19:30.370 --> 19:31.371
I'm from New York, born and

19:31.371 --> 19:31.871
raised. Yeah.

19:31.871 --> 19:35.041
>> CANDIS: Oh, wow.

19:35.041 --> 19:36.276
>> LAITH: I worked at

19:36.276 --> 19:37.277
Callen-Lorde in Chelsea, yeah.

19:37.277 --> 19:38.278
>> CANDIS: Oh, my God.

19:38.278 --> 19:39.279
>> CHANDI: I'm done.

19:39.279 --> 19:40.112
I broke a nail.

19:40.112 --> 19:41.113
>> LAITH: Well, are we gonna do

19:41.113 --> 19:41.814
this wall over here? (laughs)

19:41.814 --> 19:42.815
>> CANDIS: I'll let you take the

19:42.815 --> 19:43.316
lead on this one.

19:43.316 --> 19:44.751
>> LAITH (laughs): No.

19:44.751 --> 19:46.018
>> CANDIS: I met Laith.

19:46.018 --> 19:47.019
>> PRODUCER: Yeah, you were

19:47.019 --> 19:48.020
spending a lot of time looking

19:48.020 --> 19:49.021
up.

19:49.021 --> 19:50.022
(laughing)

19:50.022 --> 19:51.123
>> CANDIS: I mean, it's a good

19:51.123 --> 19:53.493
view from below.

19:53.493 --> 19:54.727
(laughter)

19:54.727 --> 19:56.062
>> CANDIS: Um, I was gonna ask

19:56.062 --> 19:58.598
you and Arin if you guys wanted

19:58.598 --> 20:01.401
to maybe meet for dinner later.

20:01.401 --> 20:02.502
>> LAITH: Oh, absolutely, yeah.

20:02.502 --> 20:03.503
I'd love to, yeah. (chuckles)

20:03.503 --> 20:04.504
>> CANDIS: Cool.

20:04.504 --> 20:05.505
Um, I'll let you know when

20:05.505 --> 20:06.506
and where and all that stuff.

20:06.506 --> 20:07.507
>> LAITH: Okay, cool.

20:07.507 --> 20:08.508
Sounds good.

20:08.508 --> 20:10.510
>> CANDIS: Okay, good.

20:12.945 --> 20:15.982
(insects chirping, chittering)

20:15.982 --> 20:17.684
(dogs snarling)

20:17.684 --> 20:19.619
>> ZACKARY: Have fun.

20:19.619 --> 20:21.854
>> CHANDI: We're at Legends.

20:21.854 --> 20:23.823
*

20:35.001 --> 20:36.969
>> ELLA: Where are the boys?

20:36.969 --> 20:40.072
>> CANDIS: Oh, there's Laith!

20:40.072 --> 20:40.940
>> LAITH: What's going on?

20:40.940 --> 20:41.741
(laughs)

20:41.741 --> 20:42.675
>> CANDIS: Hi, gorgeous.

20:42.675 --> 20:43.343
>> LAITH: Hello.

20:43.343 --> 20:44.277
>> CANDIS: You made it.

20:44.277 --> 20:44.944
>> LAITH: You got the bull

20:44.944 --> 20:45.612
set-up right here.

20:45.612 --> 20:47.013
>> CANDIS: I know!

20:47.013 --> 20:49.316
*

20:49.316 --> 20:50.417
>> JENNY: Our professor from

20:50.417 --> 20:51.684
Maine is gonna go Oklahoma

20:51.684 --> 20:53.286
style!

20:53.286 --> 20:54.454
Be gentle with me!

20:54.454 --> 20:56.423
(whooping)

20:56.423 --> 21:00.226
(Jenny yelling)

21:00.226 --> 21:02.094
Yee-haw!

21:02.094 --> 21:03.663
>> CHANDI: Candis is running

21:03.663 --> 21:07.099
around, dancing and... oh!

21:07.099 --> 21:09.068
*

21:12.339 --> 21:13.340
>> CANDIS: I never thought about

21:13.340 --> 21:15.041
dating somebody who's trans,

21:15.041 --> 21:17.076
ever, and then, you know,

21:17.076 --> 21:18.210
meeting Laith... he's really

21:18.210 --> 21:19.479
beautiful.

21:19.479 --> 21:22.782
So I should, maybe, open myself

21:22.782 --> 21:26.085
up to a bigger pool of guys that

21:26.085 --> 21:28.054
I'm willing to date.

21:28.054 --> 21:29.155
>> LAITH: It was great to meet

21:29.155 --> 21:30.923
you.

21:30.923 --> 21:31.758
You're awesome.

21:31.758 --> 21:32.659
>> CANDIS: That's right, I am.

21:32.659 --> 21:33.526
(Laith laughs)

21:33.526 --> 21:34.694
That's great.

21:34.694 --> 21:36.663
You're so cute.

21:43.903 --> 21:44.804
>> CAITLYN: Do you think it's

21:44.804 --> 21:45.972
elegant? The whole thing?

21:45.972 --> 21:46.673
>> JEREMY: It's more than

21:46.673 --> 21:47.374
elegant.

21:47.374 --> 21:48.107
>> CAITLYN: That's it, babe.

21:48.107 --> 21:49.376
You're so good.

21:49.376 --> 21:50.710
Are you my date tonight?

21:50.710 --> 21:51.444
>> JEREMY: Of course.

21:51.444 --> 21:52.244
>> CAITLYN: Of course you're...

21:52.244 --> 21:54.146
(laughter)

21:54.146 --> 21:55.247
Well, thank you for making it

21:55.247 --> 21:56.383
here for this.

21:56.383 --> 21:57.283
>> JEREMY: Oh, my goodness, my

21:57.283 --> 21:58.217
pleasure.

21:58.217 --> 21:59.051
Wouldn't miss it for the world.

21:59.051 --> 21:59.752
>> CAITLYN: I know!

21:59.752 --> 22:00.920
It's the Glamour Awards.

22:00.920 --> 22:01.754
>> BUZZ: Caitlyn, when did you

22:01.754 --> 22:02.455
find out you were getting the

22:02.455 --> 22:03.255
award?

22:03.255 --> 22:03.990
>> CAITLYN: Yeah, a couple of

22:03.990 --> 22:04.691
months ago.

22:04.691 --> 22:05.792
I was kind of shocked and

22:05.792 --> 22:07.494
extraordinarily honored.

22:07.494 --> 22:09.161
>> BUZZ: Why were you shocked?

22:09.161 --> 22:10.029
>> CAITLYN: You don't grow up

22:10.029 --> 22:13.500
your whole life as being me, and

22:13.500 --> 22:16.536
think that your biggest fear is

22:16.536 --> 22:19.539
that you would be thought of as

22:19.539 --> 22:20.973
an absolute freak and weirdo,

22:20.973 --> 22:21.974
and...

22:21.974 --> 22:22.709
>> BUZZ: Right.

22:22.709 --> 22:24.411
>> CAITLYN: To be so welcomed,

22:24.411 --> 22:26.979
by not only the trans

22:26.979 --> 22:30.216
community, but, uh, Glamour

22:30.216 --> 22:32.985
magazine, womanhood in general,

22:32.985 --> 22:36.956
it's, um... uh, it's a

22:36.956 --> 22:38.925
wonderful, wonderful feeling.

22:42.862 --> 22:45.432
Perfect.

22:45.432 --> 22:47.500
Cinderella!

22:47.500 --> 22:49.469
(crowd clamoring)

22:58.478 --> 22:59.912
>> GUARD: Kylie isn't here yet.

22:59.912 --> 23:00.913
I'll inform you when she

23:00.913 --> 23:02.549
arrives.

23:02.549 --> 23:04.116
>> CAITLYN: You got it.

23:04.116 --> 23:07.520
>> MAN: Caitlyn!

23:07.520 --> 23:08.655
>> CAITLYN: Going to a big event

23:08.655 --> 23:10.256
like this, it's always more fun

23:10.256 --> 23:11.123
to go and share it with somebody

23:11.123 --> 23:12.124
else.

23:12.124 --> 23:13.693
So, of course, I wanted Kylie to

23:13.693 --> 23:15.094
go with me.

23:15.094 --> 23:17.464
But she's had a wardrobe

23:17.464 --> 23:19.699
malfunction.

23:19.699 --> 23:21.000
So I gotta do the red carpet all

23:21.000 --> 23:22.268
by myself.

23:22.268 --> 23:23.169
And to be honest with you, that

23:23.169 --> 23:24.937
is very scary.

23:24.937 --> 23:26.138
(clamoring)

23:26.138 --> 23:27.239
>> MAN: Caitlyn!

23:27.239 --> 23:29.642
Caitlyn!

23:29.642 --> 23:31.744
Caitlyn...!

23:31.744 --> 23:33.145
>> CAITLYN: I wanted you right

23:33.145 --> 23:33.813
by my side.

23:33.813 --> 23:34.614
>> KYLIE: My dress ripped all

23:34.614 --> 23:35.982
the way down my ass.

23:35.982 --> 23:36.649
>> CAITLYN: Okay.

23:36.649 --> 23:37.484
>> KYLIE: I wouldn't want to be

23:37.484 --> 23:38.250
on a red carpet with my vagina

23:38.250 --> 23:39.652
out.

23:39.652 --> 23:40.653
>> CAITLYN: Uh...

23:40.653 --> 23:41.521
>> MIMI: I'll say good-bye to

23:41.521 --> 23:42.855
Chandi and come back and say

23:42.855 --> 23:44.591
hello to Miss Chandelier.

23:44.591 --> 23:46.759
(Candis laughs)

23:46.759 --> 23:48.761
(Kate whooping)

23:48.761 --> 23:50.730
*

23:56.703 --> 23:58.104
>> CAITLYN: All right, will do.

23:58.104 --> 23:59.271
>> KYLIE: Hello.

23:59.271 --> 24:00.072
>> CAITLYN: You got it.

24:00.072 --> 24:01.641
Till then, bye.

24:01.641 --> 24:02.509
Hi, baby.

24:02.509 --> 24:04.811
Can I say something?

24:04.811 --> 24:06.579
You were supposed to be my date

24:06.579 --> 24:08.548
last night on the red carpet.

24:12.384 --> 24:13.920
Honestly, I wanted you right by

24:13.920 --> 24:14.954
my side.

24:14.954 --> 24:16.222
>> KYLIE: My dress was

24:16.222 --> 24:17.256
completely see-through and then

24:17.256 --> 24:18.725
my option "B" ripped all the

24:18.725 --> 24:20.159
way down my ass.

24:20.159 --> 24:21.027
>> CAITLYN: Okay.

24:21.027 --> 24:21.861
>> KYLIE: I wouldn't want to be

24:21.861 --> 24:23.029
on a red carpet with my vagina

24:23.029 --> 24:24.063
out.

24:24.063 --> 24:25.297
>> CAITLYN: Uh...

24:25.297 --> 24:26.533
>> KYLIE: My vagina was out.

24:26.533 --> 24:28.535
Not my boob, not my butt crack,

24:28.535 --> 24:30.102
my vagina.

24:30.102 --> 24:31.103
>> CAITLYN: I didn't know all

24:31.103 --> 24:32.772
that, but, hopefully, we

24:32.772 --> 24:33.873
could've worked around that

24:33.873 --> 24:34.741
somehow.

24:34.741 --> 24:36.108
>> KYLIE: And my option "B," my

24:36.108 --> 24:37.777
whole zipper ripped down, so...

24:37.777 --> 24:38.878
>> CAITLYN: Okay.

24:38.878 --> 24:39.712
>> KYLIE: And I had a tailor

24:39.712 --> 24:40.613
there, trying to fix it.

24:40.613 --> 24:41.814
>> CAITLYN: Okay.

24:41.814 --> 24:43.182
Kind of disappointed in Kylie,

24:43.182 --> 24:45.017
but at least she showed up for

24:45.017 --> 24:46.919
the actual show.

24:46.919 --> 24:47.920
Of course, I wanted her to go

24:47.920 --> 24:49.355
with me to the red carpet, but

24:49.355 --> 24:52.124
I need to feel comfortable just

24:52.124 --> 24:54.293
doing them on my own.

24:54.293 --> 24:57.029
Okay, well, then next time...

24:57.029 --> 24:58.831
I'm dragging your ass there.

24:58.831 --> 25:00.800
>> KYLIE: Yeah.

25:11.010 --> 25:11.678
>> DRIVER: Hey.

25:11.678 --> 25:12.344
>> CANDIS: Hi!

25:12.344 --> 25:13.012
Are you ready for the drive?

25:13.012 --> 25:13.680
>> DRIVER: Ready, ready.

25:13.680 --> 25:15.682
Born ready.

25:15.682 --> 25:17.650
*

25:21.153 --> 25:23.122
(Jenny, Ella shouting, laughing)

25:25.825 --> 25:26.959
>> KATE: Chandi, where you

25:26.959 --> 25:28.127
headed?

25:28.127 --> 25:29.729
>> CHANDI: To Chicago.

25:29.729 --> 25:32.231
>> KATE: It's a red eye!

25:32.231 --> 25:34.300
Look, see? Red.

25:34.300 --> 25:35.167
>> CANDIS: What's the hardest

25:35.167 --> 25:36.368
part of road life?

25:36.368 --> 25:39.238
>> KATE: Not enough marijuana.

25:39.238 --> 25:41.641
>> DRIVER: #boomboom.

25:41.641 --> 25:43.610
(laughter)

25:45.812 --> 25:47.780
(indistinct chatter)

25:55.622 --> 25:59.291
>> KATE: Ha ha! Hello, Chicago!

25:59.291 --> 26:00.693
>> CHANDI: It's the woman of the

26:00.693 --> 26:01.794
year!

26:01.794 --> 26:03.495
>> CANDIS: Woman of the year!

26:03.495 --> 26:05.464
>> CAITLYN: Hey, babe, there you

26:05.464 --> 26:08.467
go, Chandi, how you doing?

26:08.467 --> 26:09.301
>> CHANDI: Incredible!

26:09.301 --> 26:10.502
I'm loving the hair.

26:10.502 --> 26:11.237
>> CAITLYN: Zackary, you're

26:11.237 --> 26:12.071
back!

26:12.071 --> 26:13.105
I think we need to go have some

26:13.105 --> 26:14.140
pizza and talk about all that.

26:14.140 --> 26:15.041
>> KATE: Yes.

26:15.041 --> 26:18.711
(murmurs of agreement)

26:18.711 --> 26:19.812
>> KATE: I've heard about this

26:19.812 --> 26:20.913
for years.

26:20.913 --> 26:21.781
>> ELLA: It's delicious.

26:21.781 --> 26:22.882
The best pizza in the world.

26:22.882 --> 26:24.016
>> CANDIS: We are in Chicago,

26:24.016 --> 26:25.785
and you know, Chicago's known

26:25.785 --> 26:27.386
for the Baton Show Lounge.

26:27.386 --> 26:29.288
Mimi Marks works there, and so I

26:29.288 --> 26:30.322
asked her if I could come and do

26:30.322 --> 26:31.658
a number with her...

26:31.658 --> 26:32.859
>> CAITLYN: Ooh!

26:32.859 --> 26:33.559
>> CANDIS: And you guys could

26:33.559 --> 26:34.226
come and watch the show...

26:34.226 --> 26:34.894
>> CAITLYN: We gotta see the

26:34.894 --> 26:35.394
show.

26:35.394 --> 26:36.128
>> CANDIS: ... and see the other

26:36.128 --> 26:36.796
performers.

26:36.796 --> 26:37.897
And trans people have been

26:37.897 --> 26:40.299
performing in drag bars since

26:40.299 --> 26:41.033
the beginning of time.

26:41.033 --> 26:42.068
>> CAITLYN: Oh, I-I agree.

26:42.068 --> 26:43.135
>> CHANDI: It totally saved me

26:43.135 --> 26:44.070
and helped me figure out who I

26:44.070 --> 26:44.971
was.

26:44.971 --> 26:46.673
I look at it a, um, a beautiful

26:46.673 --> 26:47.439
thing.

26:47.439 --> 26:48.174
>> CAITLYN: I don't see you

26:48.174 --> 26:49.976
going to drag shows.

26:49.976 --> 26:51.143
>> JENNY: Um, it's not... it's

26:51.143 --> 26:52.278
not really my thing.

26:52.278 --> 26:53.713
Some of my sisters and brothers,

26:53.713 --> 26:55.381
it's important for them to see

26:55.381 --> 26:57.383
their lives not as a

26:57.383 --> 27:00.419
performance, but as-as reality.

27:00.419 --> 27:02.321
>> CHANDI: I'm totally confused

27:02.321 --> 27:05.424
with how some of your, um,

27:05.424 --> 27:07.559
brothers and sisters, who

27:07.559 --> 27:09.595
identify with our community,

27:09.595 --> 27:12.598
separate themselves from the

27:12.598 --> 27:16.335
world in which some of us began.

27:16.335 --> 27:17.737
>> JENNY: Drag doesn't do a lot

27:17.737 --> 27:18.771
for me.

27:18.771 --> 27:19.706
I'm not pretending to be

27:19.706 --> 27:21.073
anything.

27:21.073 --> 27:22.374
So there are people in the drag

27:22.374 --> 27:24.911
community who find this, uh, a

27:24.911 --> 27:27.213
great source of fun and love

27:27.213 --> 27:28.981
and celebration of life.

27:28.981 --> 27:30.717
And then there are other people

27:30.717 --> 27:33.019
who say, "This is about

27:33.019 --> 27:34.987
performance, and our lives are

27:34.987 --> 27:36.222
not about performance, our lives

27:36.222 --> 27:38.457
are about the reality."

27:38.457 --> 27:42.061
Some of us come from, uh, a drag

27:42.061 --> 27:43.362
or a performance or-or showgirl

27:43.362 --> 27:44.964
universe.

27:44.964 --> 27:46.032
>> CANDIS: Mm-hmm.

27:46.032 --> 27:47.433
>> JENNY: And some of us don't.

27:47.433 --> 27:48.735
>> CHANDI: I would never expect

27:48.735 --> 27:50.903
you to be able to identify with

27:50.903 --> 27:52.538
the world that we've come from,

27:52.538 --> 27:54.173
because it has never been your

27:54.173 --> 27:55.742
stilo.

27:55.742 --> 27:57.276
It wasn't your introduction.

27:57.276 --> 27:59.846
I totally respect the fact that

27:59.846 --> 28:01.781
Jenny sees things from that

28:01.781 --> 28:03.215
perspective.

28:03.215 --> 28:05.084
But she should be able to see

28:05.084 --> 28:06.518
the connection between our

28:06.518 --> 28:08.487
communities.

28:16.763 --> 28:18.998
>> CANDIS: Jenny and Cait

28:18.998 --> 28:21.200
processed it differently, they

28:21.200 --> 28:22.368
hid differently.

28:22.368 --> 28:23.369
>> CHANDI: If it wasn't for

28:23.369 --> 28:24.937
drag, maybe I would be a

28:24.937 --> 28:27.807
miserable gay boy, trapped.

28:27.807 --> 28:28.975
>> CANDIS: Would it be harder

28:28.975 --> 28:30.977
for you to be dating a man, as

28:30.977 --> 28:32.511
opposed to a woman?

28:32.511 --> 28:33.412
>> CAITLYN: I think it might be

28:33.412 --> 28:34.346
a little bit tougher on the

28:34.346 --> 28:37.483
girls if it was, um, a guy.

28:37.483 --> 28:38.851
If I was dating some guy, they

28:38.851 --> 28:41.320
would go, "Wow!"

28:42.688 --> 28:44.824
(knocking on door)

28:44.824 --> 28:46.125
>> CANDIS: Hi, honey.

28:46.125 --> 28:47.059
(Chandi laughs)

28:47.059 --> 28:47.894
Can I come in?

28:47.894 --> 28:48.594
>> CHANDI: Sounds like what I

28:48.594 --> 28:49.428
was doing at your door the

28:49.428 --> 28:50.096
other day.

28:50.096 --> 28:50.797
>> CANDIS: Ooh, you have it

28:50.797 --> 28:52.131
chilly up in here!

28:52.131 --> 28:52.865
>> CHANDI: I was gonna pop this

28:52.865 --> 28:54.133
champagne open.

28:54.133 --> 28:55.434
>> CANDIS: Oh! (chuckles)

28:55.434 --> 28:56.435
>> CHANDI: Mm-hmm.

28:56.435 --> 28:59.972
I couldn't get over JB.

28:59.972 --> 29:02.074
If it wasn't for drag and being

29:02.074 --> 29:04.510
able to do... do those shows,

29:04.510 --> 29:05.912
maybe I would be a miserable gay

29:05.912 --> 29:09.816
boy, trapped, right now.

29:09.816 --> 29:11.483
>> CANDIS: A lot of times, like

29:11.483 --> 29:15.154
Jenny and Cait, they come from a

29:15.154 --> 29:17.023
different side, they processed

29:17.023 --> 29:18.390
it differently, they hid

29:18.390 --> 29:19.992
differently.

29:19.992 --> 29:20.993
>> CHANDI: That used to be a

29:20.993 --> 29:22.094
stress reliever for me, and I

29:22.094 --> 29:24.563
miss... I miss it.

29:24.563 --> 29:25.731
I really do.

29:25.731 --> 29:26.565
>> CANDIS: We all know how much

29:26.565 --> 29:27.399
you love your work and you love

29:27.399 --> 29:28.200
your kids.

29:28.200 --> 29:28.868
>> CHANDI: Mm-hmm.

29:28.868 --> 29:30.002
>> CANDIS: But there is...

29:30.002 --> 29:31.871
You will not survive if you

29:31.871 --> 29:34.240
don't clock out.

29:34.240 --> 29:35.274
>> CHANDI: Right.

29:35.274 --> 29:37.043
Clocking out is a big issue for

29:37.043 --> 29:38.477
me.

29:38.477 --> 29:42.248
Because I feel like I need to be

29:42.248 --> 29:43.749
there for them.

29:43.749 --> 29:46.052
And my mom, she's dealing with a

29:46.052 --> 29:49.021
lot right now.

29:49.021 --> 29:50.857
>> CANDIS: Talk about it.

29:50.857 --> 29:52.859
Talk about it, honey.

29:56.228 --> 29:57.997
(exhales)

29:57.997 --> 29:59.665
>> CHANDI: My dad was one of the

29:59.665 --> 30:02.234
best people that...

30:06.272 --> 30:07.940
...any person could really ask

30:07.940 --> 30:09.108
for.

30:09.108 --> 30:12.478
And he has been dealing with

30:12.478 --> 30:15.915
dementia and my mom is always,

30:15.915 --> 30:18.317
always, always not thinking

30:18.317 --> 30:20.987
about herself because she's so

30:20.987 --> 30:22.488
worried about him.

30:22.488 --> 30:24.223
And that's where I get it from.

30:24.223 --> 30:25.624
When you talk all day and you

30:25.624 --> 30:27.259
have to, you know, try to fix

30:27.259 --> 30:29.061
things for people, and

30:29.061 --> 30:30.462
you're-you're trying to find

30:30.462 --> 30:31.931
housing and you're trying to

30:31.931 --> 30:34.000
find food, it's one of those

30:34.000 --> 30:35.567
things that gets really crazy

30:35.567 --> 30:37.636
for me, because it makes me

30:37.636 --> 30:39.939
want to do so much more.

30:39.939 --> 30:40.973
(Chandi sobs)

30:40.973 --> 30:42.942
>> CANDIS: I know, honey.

30:45.444 --> 30:47.346
Chandi is amazing.

30:47.346 --> 30:49.882
She comes across, always, as

30:49.882 --> 30:52.418
really happy and she's always a

30:52.418 --> 30:54.653
really positive person, and she

30:54.653 --> 30:57.789
works non-stop with on-the-edge

30:57.789 --> 30:58.925
youth.

30:58.925 --> 31:00.126
>> CHANDI: Hi!

31:00.126 --> 31:01.093
We do get into heavy

31:01.093 --> 31:02.161
discussions.

31:02.161 --> 31:02.929
You know.

31:02.929 --> 31:04.430
We lay it all on the line.

31:04.430 --> 31:05.431
>> YOUNG WOMAN: They asked me

31:05.431 --> 31:06.933
for my I.D. and then it was

31:06.933 --> 31:08.567
like, um, "She's a tranny."

31:08.567 --> 31:09.435
>> YOUNG MAN: Some people look

31:09.435 --> 31:11.170
at me as a human, and some other

31:11.170 --> 31:12.704
people look at me as an animal.

31:12.704 --> 31:13.705
>> CAITLYN: It's extremely

31:13.705 --> 31:15.474
important that we're heard.

31:15.474 --> 31:16.675
>> CHANDI: And we say thank you

31:16.675 --> 31:19.946
for everybody coming to group.

31:19.946 --> 31:21.347
>> CANDIS: But you know, I think

31:21.347 --> 31:23.950
that she has a lot more going on

31:23.950 --> 31:25.952
then any of us even realize.

31:25.952 --> 31:27.853
>> CHANDI: All I say is it's

31:27.853 --> 31:29.821
gonna be okay, Candis.

31:37.029 --> 31:38.430
>> ZACKARY: Here we go.

31:38.430 --> 31:40.432
You look bodacious. (laughs)

31:40.432 --> 31:42.134
For some of the girls, finding

31:42.134 --> 31:44.636
love, it's a challenge.

31:44.636 --> 31:45.304
>> CAITLYN: One drink.

31:45.304 --> 31:45.972
Are you buying?

31:45.972 --> 31:46.638
Of course you are.

31:46.638 --> 31:47.373
>> ZACKARY: Yes, I'll buy.

31:47.373 --> 31:48.074
>> CAITLYN: Okay, right, okay.

31:48.074 --> 31:48.807
>> ZACKARY: Yes, I'll buy.

31:48.807 --> 31:49.808
So we are all gonna have

31:49.808 --> 31:51.543
cocktails at the hotel.

31:51.543 --> 31:53.412
I'm hoping to exercise my

31:53.412 --> 31:55.714
matchmaking skills.

31:55.714 --> 31:56.848
>> CANDIS: There's a lot of boys

31:56.848 --> 31:57.849
around.

31:57.849 --> 31:59.551
>> ZACKARY: (laughs) All right.

31:59.551 --> 32:00.552
>> JENNY: I think Zackary and

32:00.552 --> 32:02.788
Candis went to mingle.

32:02.788 --> 32:03.789
>> COURTNEY: There's this whole

32:03.789 --> 32:04.991
table of guys back here.

32:04.991 --> 32:06.892
>> CAITLYN: Um, it's like...

32:06.892 --> 32:08.660
I'm uncomfortable.

32:08.660 --> 32:09.661
It's in the middle of such a

32:09.661 --> 32:10.762
public place.

32:10.762 --> 32:11.763
Yeah.

32:11.763 --> 32:12.798
>> COURTNEY: Oh, really?

32:12.798 --> 32:14.000
>> CAITLYN: Yeah.

32:14.000 --> 32:15.567
For me, the big problem I have

32:15.567 --> 32:17.903
in a lot of things is rejection.

32:17.903 --> 32:19.171
That's why, probably, one of the

32:19.171 --> 32:21.140
reasons I didn't date that much.

32:21.140 --> 32:22.141
>> SCOTT: I'm Scott.

32:22.141 --> 32:23.242
>> CANDIS: Hi, nice to meet you,

32:23.242 --> 32:24.610
Patrick. Scott.

32:24.610 --> 32:25.411
>> ZACKARY: We're staying in

32:25.411 --> 32:26.078
this hotel.

32:26.078 --> 32:26.578
>> MAN: Okay.

32:26.578 --> 32:27.279
>> ZACKARY: So we're just

32:27.279 --> 32:27.779
hanging out.

32:27.779 --> 32:28.280
>> MAN: Nice.

32:28.280 --> 32:29.015
>> ZACKARY: You know?

32:29.015 --> 32:29.748
>> CAITLYN: What's your name?

32:29.748 --> 32:30.449
>> JOE: I'm a friend of

32:30.449 --> 32:31.117
Taylor's. Joe.

32:31.117 --> 32:31.883
>> CAITLYN: Okay.

32:31.883 --> 32:32.851
>> CANDIS: Caitlyn doesn't

32:32.851 --> 32:34.586
really know how to talk to guys

32:34.586 --> 32:36.122
at all.

32:36.122 --> 32:37.789
With a flirt, with something

32:37.789 --> 32:40.526
more than just who she is.

32:40.526 --> 32:41.693
And so she doesn't know how

32:41.693 --> 32:43.595
to... follow.

32:43.595 --> 32:45.331
She wants to lead.

32:45.331 --> 32:46.532
>> CAITLYN: Well, Joe, it was

32:46.532 --> 32:47.333
nice meeting you.

32:47.333 --> 32:48.834
What do you do for, uh, work?

32:48.834 --> 32:49.568
What do you do?

32:49.568 --> 32:50.802
>> JOE: I own, uh, a real estate

32:50.802 --> 32:52.438
office and I'm a developer.

32:52.438 --> 32:53.305
>> CAITLYN: Oh, so, residentials

32:53.305 --> 32:54.640
or commercial?

32:54.640 --> 32:55.341
>> JOE: Little of both.

32:55.341 --> 32:56.042
>> CAITLYN: Whatever.

32:56.042 --> 32:56.742
>> JOE: Commercial.

32:56.742 --> 32:57.543
>> CAITLYN: Wherever there's...

32:57.543 --> 32:58.244
wherever you can make a buck.

32:58.244 --> 32:58.910
>> JOE: That's right.

32:58.910 --> 32:59.578
>> CANDIS: Sometimes, when

32:59.578 --> 33:01.547
you're talking to guys, you have

33:01.547 --> 33:02.881
to take the back seat a little

33:02.881 --> 33:03.915
bit.

33:03.915 --> 33:04.916
I don't know if she's ready to

33:04.916 --> 33:06.218
do that.

33:06.218 --> 33:08.054
>> CAITLYN: I'm outta here.

33:08.054 --> 33:09.421
>> ZACKARY: Did Jenner leave?

33:09.421 --> 33:10.422
>> JENNY: Jenner's... Jenner's

33:10.422 --> 33:12.391
left the building.

33:18.130 --> 33:19.431
>> CANDIS: Hello?

33:19.431 --> 33:20.466
>> CAITLYN: Oh!

33:20.466 --> 33:22.068
Coming in the back door?

33:22.068 --> 33:23.069
>> CANDIS: I realized that we

33:23.069 --> 33:23.735
have adjoining rooms.

33:23.735 --> 33:24.470
>> CAITLYN: We have adjoining

33:24.470 --> 33:25.137
rooms, I know that, yeah.

33:25.137 --> 33:26.305
I know, I know.

33:26.305 --> 33:27.606
>> CANDIS: They're gonna talk.

33:27.606 --> 33:29.441
>> CAITLYN: Now, you need any

33:29.441 --> 33:30.509
hair?

33:30.509 --> 33:31.643
>> CANDIS: Uh, well...

33:31.643 --> 33:32.444
>> CAITLYN: Courtney's got the

33:32.444 --> 33:33.145
hair.

33:33.145 --> 33:33.879
>> CANDIS: Oh, that's cool.

33:33.879 --> 33:34.580
>> CAITLYN: You should,

33:34.580 --> 33:35.347
actually, put some dark streaks

33:35.347 --> 33:36.315
in there.

33:36.315 --> 33:37.816
Well, how are you doing?

33:37.816 --> 33:38.817
>> CANDIS: I'm good.

33:38.817 --> 33:40.319
I was gonna say that, um, you

33:40.319 --> 33:41.320
wouldn't dance with the guys

33:41.320 --> 33:42.654
when we went dancing.

33:42.654 --> 33:43.355
You only wanted to dance with

33:43.355 --> 33:44.090
me.

33:44.090 --> 33:44.790
>> CAITLYN: I just didn't feel

33:44.790 --> 33:45.291
comfortable.

33:45.291 --> 33:45.957
>> CANDIS: Which is fine.

33:45.957 --> 33:46.758
I'm not trying to push you into

33:46.758 --> 33:47.493
anything.

33:47.493 --> 33:48.294
>> CAITLYN: Yeah.

33:48.294 --> 33:49.295
>> CANDIS: I'm just-just, you

33:49.295 --> 33:50.896
know, trying to get you trying

33:50.896 --> 33:53.099
new things as far as dating.

33:53.099 --> 33:54.733
>> CAITLYN: I look at you girls

33:54.733 --> 33:56.502
and I listen to you about all

33:56.502 --> 33:59.638
the challenges of dating as a

33:59.638 --> 34:01.707
trans woman.

34:01.707 --> 34:02.741
>> CANDIS: Right.

34:02.741 --> 34:04.143
>> CAITLYN: Okay?

34:04.143 --> 34:07.146
How guys, like, want to have sex

34:07.146 --> 34:08.280
with you, but then they don't

34:08.280 --> 34:09.715
want to be seen with you.

34:09.715 --> 34:10.849
Yeah.

34:10.849 --> 34:11.650
I-I would have a hard time with

34:11.650 --> 34:13.819
that.

34:13.819 --> 34:16.688
Yeah.

34:16.688 --> 34:18.257
>> CANDIS: What is holding you

34:18.257 --> 34:20.792
back from... just going on a

34:20.792 --> 34:22.761
date with someone?

34:25.131 --> 34:25.931
>> CAITLYN: You know, the other

34:25.931 --> 34:27.433
day, I thought about bringing it

34:27.433 --> 34:29.501
up to Kylie.

34:29.501 --> 34:30.802
You know.

34:30.802 --> 34:32.371
"I was, uh... maybe I should

34:32.371 --> 34:33.639
start dating or doing something

34:33.639 --> 34:35.674
like that."

34:35.674 --> 34:37.543
And I was thinking about it, and

34:37.543 --> 34:38.844
I thought: I can't.

34:38.844 --> 34:40.912
I just... I-I can't even bring

34:40.912 --> 34:42.881
the subject up.

34:45.284 --> 34:46.418
*

34:46.418 --> 34:47.886
(cheering)

34:47.886 --> 34:48.654
>> WOMAN: Hey, we all ready for

34:48.654 --> 34:49.421
a good time?

34:49.421 --> 34:51.190
>> JENNY: Chandi! (whoops)

34:51.190 --> 34:52.358
>> CAITLYN: So much fun for me

34:52.358 --> 34:53.725
to watch my little Chandi up

34:53.725 --> 34:55.727
there, letting it go.

34:55.727 --> 34:57.696
(whooping)

35:05.804 --> 35:06.772
>> CAITLYN: You know, the other

35:06.772 --> 35:08.440
day, I thought about bringing it

35:08.440 --> 35:10.842
up to Kylie.

35:10.842 --> 35:12.244
You know.

35:12.244 --> 35:14.513
"I was, uh... maybe I should

35:14.513 --> 35:15.747
start dating or doing something

35:15.747 --> 35:17.183
like that."

35:17.183 --> 35:18.784
And I was thinking about it and

35:18.784 --> 35:21.220
I thought: I can't.

35:21.220 --> 35:22.821
I just... I-I can't even bring

35:22.821 --> 35:24.523
the subject up.

35:24.523 --> 35:25.224
>> CANDIS: Would it be harder

35:25.224 --> 35:27.226
for you to be dating a man, as

35:27.226 --> 35:28.627
opposed to a woman, on the kids

35:28.627 --> 35:30.095
or visa versa?

35:30.095 --> 35:30.862
>> CAITLYN: I think it might be

35:30.862 --> 35:31.630
a little bit tougher on the

35:31.630 --> 35:34.900
girls if it was, um, a guy.

35:34.900 --> 35:35.634
Yeah.

35:35.634 --> 35:37.203
I think, yeah, if I was dating

35:37.203 --> 35:40.339
some guy they would go, "Wow."

35:40.339 --> 35:41.973
Yeah. Yeah.

35:41.973 --> 35:43.609
Have you ever dated a woman?

35:43.609 --> 35:44.643
>> CANDIS: No.

35:44.643 --> 35:45.344
>> CAITLYN: No.

35:45.344 --> 35:46.612
See, okay.

35:46.612 --> 35:48.046
I'm not looking forward to

35:48.046 --> 35:49.281
having conversations about

35:49.281 --> 35:50.682
dating with my kids.

35:50.682 --> 35:53.285
I think if I were to date a man,

35:53.285 --> 35:54.286
I think it would be confusing

35:54.286 --> 35:55.387
for them.

35:55.387 --> 35:56.622
And, uh, I don't want to confuse

35:56.622 --> 35:57.689
them.

35:57.689 --> 35:58.757
>> CANDIS: You have to get to

35:58.757 --> 36:00.125
the root of what you are going

36:00.125 --> 36:01.260
through.

36:01.260 --> 36:01.927
>> CAITLYN: Yeah.

36:01.927 --> 36:02.728
>> CANDIS: You know what I mean?

36:02.728 --> 36:03.395
>> CAITLYN: Yeah.

36:03.395 --> 36:04.230
>> CANDIS: You're allowed to go

36:04.230 --> 36:07.132
out there, have fun, experiment.

36:07.132 --> 36:08.767
There's no one... no one's

36:08.767 --> 36:10.502
judging, anymore.

36:10.502 --> 36:11.270
>> CAITLYN: Yeah.

36:11.270 --> 36:12.137
>> CANDIS: Because you are

36:12.137 --> 36:12.971
living your truth.

36:12.971 --> 36:14.273
You know?

36:14.273 --> 36:15.274
>> CAITLYN: Maybe if I think of

36:15.274 --> 36:17.476
it as an experiment.

36:17.476 --> 36:18.777
>> CANDIS: Yeah.

36:18.777 --> 36:20.446
I have to tell you: I need to

36:20.446 --> 36:22.848
start new and fresh, also.

36:22.848 --> 36:23.982
Like going out on... on a group

36:23.982 --> 36:24.983
date...

36:24.983 --> 36:25.984
>> CAITLYN: Yeah.

36:25.984 --> 36:27.386
>> CANDIS: ...with Laith and

36:27.386 --> 36:29.621
Arin kind of showed me that I

36:29.621 --> 36:30.622
have to broaden my horizons,

36:30.622 --> 36:33.725
too.

36:33.725 --> 36:35.327
I think we both need to.

36:35.327 --> 36:36.127
>> CAITLYN: Yeah.

36:36.127 --> 36:37.162
A double experiment.

36:37.162 --> 36:37.963
That's why we call 'em

36:37.963 --> 36:38.697
experiments.

36:38.697 --> 36:39.598
>> CANDIS: (laughs) Salsa!

36:39.598 --> 36:40.532
>> CAITLYN: Salsa!

36:40.532 --> 36:42.734
(laughs)

36:42.734 --> 36:44.703
(indistinct chatter)

36:48.774 --> 36:49.875
>> JENNY: So are you going to

36:49.875 --> 36:50.709
the thing tonight?

36:50.709 --> 36:51.910
>> ZACKARY: Of course.

36:51.910 --> 36:53.879
We're gonna go see Candis and

36:53.879 --> 36:55.614
Chandi perform... at a drag

36:55.614 --> 36:56.682
show!

36:56.682 --> 36:58.817
(Jenny laughs)

36:58.817 --> 36:59.951
>> JENNY: Are we?

36:59.951 --> 37:01.420
I'm feeling pulled in a lot of

37:01.420 --> 37:02.821
different directions here.

37:02.821 --> 37:03.955
You know, I had this kind

37:03.955 --> 37:05.691
of... ambivalent relationship

37:05.691 --> 37:06.725
toward drag.

37:06.725 --> 37:07.826
And I think a lot of people who

37:07.826 --> 37:09.027
come from a different part of

37:09.027 --> 37:10.662
the community have this unease

37:10.662 --> 37:12.764
with some aspects of drag

37:12.764 --> 37:14.300
because there's a sense of,

37:14.300 --> 37:15.701
"Here we are, pretending to be

37:15.701 --> 37:16.868
women."

37:16.868 --> 37:18.404
And I know that that's not the

37:18.404 --> 37:20.205
best way to describe drag, but

37:20.205 --> 37:22.073
it's one way to describe drag,

37:22.073 --> 37:25.777
and, you know, so...

37:25.777 --> 37:27.479
I'm not pretending to be

37:27.479 --> 37:28.580
anything.

37:28.580 --> 37:29.715
>> ZACKARY: The trans community

37:29.715 --> 37:31.216
is so diverse, you know?

37:31.216 --> 37:32.984
And each one of us has such a

37:32.984 --> 37:35.321
different story.

37:35.321 --> 37:36.488
>> JENNY: I want to celebrate

37:36.488 --> 37:38.223
everybody's way of being, but I

37:38.223 --> 37:39.725
also want to fight for my own

37:39.725 --> 37:41.560
identity, which was hard won.

37:41.560 --> 37:43.194
And, um...

37:43.194 --> 37:44.830
>> ZACKARY: Until it... isolates

37:44.830 --> 37:46.665
you from the people that you

37:46.665 --> 37:48.767
love.

37:48.767 --> 37:50.135
Jenny's not wrong here, but

37:50.135 --> 37:51.803
neither is Chandi.

37:51.803 --> 37:53.572
The trans community as a whole

37:53.572 --> 37:55.073
is split on this issue.

37:55.073 --> 37:57.609
So it's a complicated thing, but

37:57.609 --> 37:59.077
bottom line, friends need to be

37:59.077 --> 38:00.746
there to support each other.

38:00.746 --> 38:02.414
I think the higher road to take

38:02.414 --> 38:04.516
is to, you know, go and

38:04.516 --> 38:08.119
experience it.

38:08.119 --> 38:09.355
>> JENNY: I'm being asked to do

38:09.355 --> 38:10.489
something here that I probably

38:10.489 --> 38:12.524
wouldn't normally do and I still

38:12.524 --> 38:13.925
don't think that many of my

38:13.925 --> 38:15.160
sisters understand my

38:15.160 --> 38:16.161
resistance.

38:16.161 --> 38:17.563
And we're not all gonna agree on

38:17.563 --> 38:19.765
everything, but I know they have

38:19.765 --> 38:22.401
good hearts.

38:22.401 --> 38:23.535
>> ZACKARY: You know, embracing

38:23.535 --> 38:24.970
difference is... that's your

38:24.970 --> 38:26.938
challenge here, today.

38:38.183 --> 38:40.151
>> CHANDI: Oh!

38:42.488 --> 38:43.389
>> CANDIS: Hey, girl!

38:43.389 --> 38:45.391
It's good to see you.

38:45.391 --> 38:46.458
>> REGINE: It's good to see you,

38:46.458 --> 38:47.459
too. Oh!

38:47.459 --> 38:48.394
>> CHANDI: Hi, how are you?

38:48.394 --> 38:49.160
>> REGINE: Hi, I'm Regine.

38:49.160 --> 38:49.661
How are you?

38:49.661 --> 38:50.429
>> CHANDI: Hi, Regine, I'm

38:50.429 --> 38:50.929
Chandi.

38:50.929 --> 38:51.597
>> REGINE: Nice to meet you.

38:51.597 --> 38:52.263
>> VOICE: Oh, no! No, no!

38:52.263 --> 38:53.399
>> CHANDI: Ah!

38:53.399 --> 38:54.466
>> JENNY: Okay, everybody follow

38:54.466 --> 38:55.734
me.

38:55.734 --> 38:57.436
I've come to understand that,

38:57.436 --> 38:58.904
for Chandi, the drag world saved

38:58.904 --> 39:00.171
her life, literally.

39:00.171 --> 39:01.840
So how can anyone stand in the

39:01.840 --> 39:03.308
way of that and not celebrate

39:03.308 --> 39:04.443
that?

39:04.443 --> 39:05.276
Yeah, don't-don't flash them,

39:05.276 --> 39:06.211
Jenner.

39:06.211 --> 39:06.978
>> CAITLYN: Hey... we don't

39:06.978 --> 39:07.846
want to... there we go.

39:07.846 --> 39:08.647
>> JENNY: Don't flash 'em,

39:08.647 --> 39:09.715
Jenner.

39:09.715 --> 39:10.482
>> CAITLYN: After all the

39:10.482 --> 39:11.983
controversy, for Jenny, it was

39:11.983 --> 39:12.918
great that she went to the drag

39:12.918 --> 39:13.885
show.

39:13.885 --> 39:14.886
So I think it's going to be a

39:14.886 --> 39:16.855
fun night.

39:16.855 --> 39:20.426
Thank you.

39:20.426 --> 39:21.727
>> CHANDI: Oh.

39:21.727 --> 39:24.295
I am totally nervous.

39:24.295 --> 39:26.331
A girl needs... needs a little

39:26.331 --> 39:27.766
cocktail.

39:27.766 --> 39:28.534
>> CANDIS: Yes!

39:28.534 --> 39:29.501
I'm gonna go see what I can do.

39:29.501 --> 39:30.502
(Chandi laughs)

39:30.502 --> 39:31.437
>> CHANDI: That will help me

39:31.437 --> 39:34.172
with my nerves, you know.

39:34.172 --> 39:35.974
It has been so long since I have

39:35.974 --> 39:37.776
performed.

39:37.776 --> 39:40.512
So I am a little nervous, but

39:40.512 --> 39:42.448
I've received nothing but love

39:42.448 --> 39:44.182
from Candis and Mimi.

39:44.182 --> 39:46.151
And that does help calm anyone's

39:46.151 --> 39:47.152
nerves.

39:47.152 --> 39:48.454
Hopefully.

39:48.454 --> 39:49.888
(laughs)

39:49.888 --> 39:50.689
>> MIMI: All right, I'll see you

39:50.689 --> 39:51.356
in a minute.

39:51.356 --> 39:52.023
>> CANDIS: Have fun.

39:52.023 --> 39:53.091
>> MIMI: I'll say good-bye to

39:53.091 --> 39:54.526
Chandi and come back and say

39:54.526 --> 39:56.327
hello to Miss Chandelier.

39:56.327 --> 39:57.195
(Candis laughs)

39:57.195 --> 39:59.130
>> CHANDI: Oh, right!

39:59.130 --> 40:02.468
(cheering)

40:02.468 --> 40:03.234
>> WOMAN: So, we all ready for

40:03.234 --> 40:04.235
a good time?

40:04.235 --> 40:05.937
* You know my pretty girl swag

40:05.937 --> 40:07.238
Don't hate miss sis 'cause I'm

40:07.238 --> 40:08.106
bad

40:08.106 --> 40:10.041
* My head back, yep, newly bad

40:10.041 --> 40:11.309
My handbag, that's... *

40:11.309 --> 40:12.444
>> CANDIS: We have like, six

40:12.444 --> 40:14.179
numbers, and then you go on.

40:14.179 --> 40:15.581
>> CHANDI: Okay, babe.

40:15.581 --> 40:16.482
>> CANDIS: Okay?

40:16.482 --> 40:17.583
You're gonna tear it up.

40:17.583 --> 40:18.249
>> CHANDI: We gonna pray on

40:18.249 --> 40:18.984
that.

40:18.984 --> 40:20.886
(both laugh)

40:20.886 --> 40:22.521
* Tonight I'm doing it big

40:22.521 --> 40:24.723
Might switch it up, rock a wig

40:24.723 --> 40:26.091
* Hear them say "Oh, no, she

40:26.091 --> 40:26.758
didn't..." *

40:26.758 --> 40:27.759
(bleep)

40:27.759 --> 40:28.860
(cheers, whooping)

40:28.860 --> 40:30.829
*

40:39.037 --> 40:40.305
>> CHANDI: I hope I don't slip

40:40.305 --> 40:41.607
and slide.

40:41.607 --> 40:42.674
>> CANDIS: We've had such an

40:42.674 --> 40:43.942
amazing cast tonight.

40:43.942 --> 40:45.110
>> MIMI: Yes, but we have one

40:45.110 --> 40:46.712
entertainer that...

40:46.712 --> 40:47.713
>> CANDIS: She hasn't done a

40:47.713 --> 40:48.814
show in a long time.

40:48.814 --> 40:50.582
>> MIMI: She said "decades."

40:50.582 --> 40:52.651
"Decades."

40:52.651 --> 40:53.885
>> CANDIS: Without further

40:53.885 --> 40:55.420
ado...

40:55.420 --> 40:57.322
>> MIMI: For her return back to

40:57.322 --> 40:58.456
the stage...

40:58.456 --> 41:00.158
>> CANDIS: of Miss...

41:00.158 --> 41:02.193
>> CANDIS AND MIMI: Chandelier!

41:02.193 --> 41:05.096
(cheering)

41:06.565 --> 41:07.566
>> CANDIS: Without further

41:07.566 --> 41:08.567
ado...

41:08.567 --> 41:09.968
>> MIMI: For her return back to

41:09.968 --> 41:11.269
the stage...

41:11.269 --> 41:12.871
>> CANDIS: Of Miss...

41:12.871 --> 41:14.873
>> CANDIS AND MIMI: Chandelier!

41:14.873 --> 41:16.975
(cheering, whooping)

41:16.975 --> 41:18.944
(drumroll)

41:22.080 --> 41:23.982
* Sit back and put your feet up

41:23.982 --> 41:25.551
Yes, sir, and feel the rhythm

41:25.551 --> 41:26.985
You know we going crazy

41:26.985 --> 41:27.986
* All turned up like Patrick

41:27.986 --> 41:29.420
Swayze... *

41:29.420 --> 41:31.389
*

41:36.562 --> 41:37.563
>> CANDIS: Miss Chandelier

41:37.563 --> 41:38.564
was incredible.

41:38.564 --> 41:39.965
When she went on stage, it was

41:39.965 --> 41:41.700
like... she was meant to be

41:41.700 --> 41:43.201
there.

41:43.201 --> 41:46.638
*

41:46.638 --> 41:49.875
* You know how to rock it...

41:49.875 --> 41:51.743
>> CAITLYN: It was so much fun

41:51.743 --> 41:53.745
for me to watch my little Chandi

41:53.745 --> 41:56.715
up there, letting it go.

41:56.715 --> 41:58.750
All these girls are, like,

41:58.750 --> 42:00.919
taking risks all over the place.

42:00.919 --> 42:02.821
Jenny Boylan, who didn't even

42:02.821 --> 42:04.489
want to go... there she was,

42:04.489 --> 42:06.357
stuffing dollar bills down

42:06.357 --> 42:08.226
Chandi's bra.

42:08.226 --> 42:11.096
So I think she had a lot of fun.

42:11.096 --> 42:13.632
Hey!

42:13.632 --> 42:14.800
>> JENNY: Chandi!

42:14.800 --> 42:17.703
(whoops)

42:17.703 --> 42:19.605
>> CHANDI: Being able to hit

42:19.605 --> 42:21.072
that stage and unleash

42:21.072 --> 42:25.376
Chandelier, was... a moment that

42:25.376 --> 42:27.378
I hadn't experienced in a very

42:27.378 --> 42:28.747
long time.

42:28.747 --> 42:31.382
I really let go.

42:31.382 --> 42:34.185
It was totally a reconnecting

42:34.185 --> 42:36.722
moment with myself, because I

42:36.722 --> 42:38.523
forgot how good it felt.

42:38.523 --> 42:41.026
* You should be famous...

42:41.026 --> 42:42.227
It doesn't matter what walk of

42:42.227 --> 42:43.629
life you're from, you can enjoy

42:43.629 --> 42:45.030
drag.

42:45.030 --> 42:46.064
There was so much love in the

42:46.064 --> 42:47.065
air.

42:47.065 --> 42:48.433
And it was beautiful.

42:48.433 --> 42:50.936
* You should be famous.

42:50.936 --> 42:52.904
(cheering, whooping)

43:03.148 --> 43:04.149
>> ACTIVIST: Caitlyn Jenner,

43:04.149 --> 43:05.516
you're an insult to all trans

43:05.516 --> 43:06.652
people.

43:06.652 --> 43:07.719
(shouting)

43:07.719 --> 43:08.553
>> ZACKARY: You know, nobody in

43:08.553 --> 43:09.721
the trans movement is required

43:09.721 --> 43:12.658
to love any of us.

43:12.658 --> 43:14.025
>> STUDENT: How did you go about

43:14.025 --> 43:15.661
your transformation and

43:15.661 --> 43:16.962
everything, like, and still

43:16.962 --> 43:18.263
acknowledging God in your life?

43:18.263 --> 43:19.731
Because, like, religion and

43:19.731 --> 43:21.800
everything...

43:21.800 --> 43:22.668
>> CAITLYN: I'm going to Des

43:22.668 --> 43:25.737
Moines... Democratic debate.

43:25.737 --> 43:27.038
>> CANDIS: Oh, my God.

43:27.038 --> 43:28.774
Is that Hillary Clinton?

43:28.774 --> 43:30.676
>> HILLARY: Oh, my gosh!
