00:53.178 --> 00:54.179
(Lighter clicks)

00:59.810 --> 01:00.811
Babe.

01:00.978 --> 01:02.980
Please don't smoke.
It'll kill your palate.

01:03.355 --> 01:05.147
Then my palate will die happy.

01:05.857 --> 01:06.858
Hey.

01:07.526 --> 01:10.320
Margot, tonight is huge, okay?

01:10.404 --> 01:12.823
The flavor profiles,
it's all super delicate.

01:12.906 --> 01:15.551
When you smoke, you ruin your ability
to be able to appreciate them.

01:15.575 --> 01:16.576
(Scoffs) Oh, come on!

01:17.035 --> 01:18.704
Please. Please.

01:22.999 --> 01:25.085
Fine. Jesus.

01:25.419 --> 01:27.796
- Thank you.
- (Ship horn blares)

01:27.879 --> 01:29.798
Oh! Thank god.

01:29.881 --> 01:30.924
(Intriguing music playing)

01:31.008 --> 01:32.402
Margot: Is that gonna fit everyone?

01:32.426 --> 01:34.469
Tyler: Yeah, easily.
Twelve customers total.

01:34.761 --> 01:35.762
Margot: A night?

01:36.013 --> 01:37.264
How do they turn a profit?

01:37.347 --> 01:39.224
Tyler: $1,250 a head. That's how.

01:39.766 --> 01:41.226
You're fucking kidding, right?

01:41.310 --> 01:42.686
What, are we eating a rolex?

01:42.978 --> 01:44.956
Come on, let's not ruin this
by talking price, yeah?

01:44.980 --> 01:46.440
Just go with the flow.

01:46.690 --> 01:47.691
Let it be magical.

01:47.774 --> 01:50.360
- Hey, it's your dime.
- Mmm.

01:50.444 --> 01:52.029
Bryce: Not bad!
Dave: Oh, thanks, man.

01:52.112 --> 01:53.256
Soren: You deserve this, baby.

01:53.280 --> 01:54.800
You know who's gonna love this? Betty!

01:55.032 --> 01:57.617
It's just a "fuck you" to accounts.

01:57.701 --> 01:58.952
It's not even a client dinner.

01:59.036 --> 02:00.704
(Laughs) Fuck. We're dicks, huh?

02:00.787 --> 02:04.249
(Groans) Great. A power tasting.

02:04.333 --> 02:06.043
They'll be wasted by the amuse.

02:06.126 --> 02:07.228
Soren: Hi, guys. Dave: By boat.

02:07.252 --> 02:09.012
How did you think we were
gonna get on the...

02:10.505 --> 02:13.133
Ted: Look at you on a gangplank in heels.

02:13.592 --> 02:14.593
Fuck.

02:15.302 --> 02:16.595
(Men grunting)

02:20.223 --> 02:21.767
Holy fucking shit.

02:22.517 --> 02:24.686
Lillian bloom. Oh, my god.

02:24.770 --> 02:26.480
- Who's Lillian bloom?
- (Shushes)

02:26.563 --> 02:27.981
Food critic for <i>saveur.</i>

02:28.648 --> 02:30.359
She basically discovered slowik.

02:31.318 --> 02:32.569
Okay, well, it's official.

02:32.652 --> 02:34.279
Tonight will be madness.

02:34.363 --> 02:35.572
(Tyler chuckles softly)

02:37.199 --> 02:39.534
Boatman: All aboard for hawthorn!

02:39.951 --> 02:42.746
Hawthorn! All aboard!

02:42.829 --> 02:43.830
Wow.

02:43.914 --> 02:45.099
Captain: (Over pa system)
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

02:45.123 --> 02:48.710
<i>please make yourselves comfortable
for our short journey to hawthorn island.</i>

02:48.794 --> 02:50.128
<i>- Thank you.
</i>- George: Ahoy!

02:50.504 --> 02:51.838
And avast, me hearties!

02:51.922 --> 02:53.548
Let's hope she's seaworthy, eh?

02:53.632 --> 02:54.925
Yes, sir. Yeah.

02:56.134 --> 02:57.386
Boat... boat jokes.

02:57.469 --> 02:58.678
- Yeah, yeah.
- Boat, yeah.

02:58.762 --> 02:59.989
- We're on a boat.
- Yeah. We're on a boat.

03:00.013 --> 03:01.056
(All chuckle)

03:01.807 --> 03:03.576
Soren: Hey, we got
a famous person on board, huh?

03:03.600 --> 03:04.768
Bryce: Fp in the house.

03:04.851 --> 03:06.937
Dave: Barely f anymore,
though. It's not 1998.

03:07.020 --> 03:08.146
Bryce: He's a p, and he's f.

03:08.230 --> 03:09.564
Oh, my god. Check it out.

03:09.648 --> 03:11.876
George: Hey, aren't you supposed
to be running interference for me?

03:11.900 --> 03:13.336
Make sure people don't bother me, then?

03:13.360 --> 03:14.960
God, we both know you were not bothered.

03:15.028 --> 03:16.714
Margot: I saw all his movies
when I was a kid.

03:16.738 --> 03:17.739
Felicity: Hey, listen.

03:17.823 --> 03:20.492
Apparently, he's a big foodie.
You know, thinks he is.

03:20.575 --> 03:21.928
Waiter: Chef slowik
would like to welcome you

03:21.952 --> 03:24.413
with a raw local oyster
in a mignonette emulsion,

03:24.496 --> 03:27.040
with lemon caviar
and an oyster leaf. Enjoy.

03:27.124 --> 03:28.524
- Beautiful. Thank you.
- Thank you.

03:28.583 --> 03:29.960
It's one of his classics. Mmm-mmm.

03:30.419 --> 03:33.088
The lemon pearls are made with alginate.

03:34.172 --> 03:36.216
- Alginate, as in, um...
- (Camera shutter clicks)

03:36.299 --> 03:37.467
As in algae. Come on.

03:38.176 --> 03:39.261
Right, yeah.

03:39.344 --> 03:40.762
- Pond scum.
- It's not...

03:40.846 --> 03:41.888
Delicious. (Chuckles)

03:51.356 --> 03:53.150
(Chuckles happily)

03:53.233 --> 03:54.443
Oh, my god.

03:55.026 --> 03:56.153
It's laughable.

03:56.236 --> 03:58.613
It's actually fucking laughably good.

03:59.698 --> 04:01.074
- It's good.
- Mmm.

04:01.158 --> 04:03.952
Think I prefer just the oyster, though.
Love oysters.

04:04.035 --> 04:06.163
No. No. It's the balance of the products.

04:06.246 --> 04:07.956
You need the mouthfeel of the mignonette.

04:08.748 --> 04:09.851
Please don't say "mouthfeel."

04:09.875 --> 04:11.626
- Too late. Mouthfeel.
- (Chuckles)

04:11.710 --> 04:13.211
(Ship horn blares)

04:13.295 --> 04:15.297
(Intense classical music playing)

04:30.061 --> 04:31.605
- (Indistinct chatter)
- Hi.

04:32.147 --> 04:33.273
Lillian: Thank you.

04:33.356 --> 04:35.066
Jesus, this is like prom.

04:35.150 --> 04:37.319
Yeah? I never went to prom.

04:37.402 --> 04:39.112
- Really? Why not?
- (Music fades)

04:39.196 --> 04:41.615
'Cause none of the cool girls
like you said, "yes."

04:41.948 --> 04:43.700
Aw, poor baby.

04:44.242 --> 04:46.703
- Well, fuck those bitches.
- (Chuckles softly)

04:46.786 --> 04:48.038
- Bryce.
- Welcome.

04:48.121 --> 04:49.498
Welcome, Mr. Lorimer.

04:50.749 --> 04:53.543
- Hello. Felicity Lynn.
- Elsa: Hello. Good evening.

04:53.627 --> 04:55.547
- And Damien Garcia.
- Elsa: And Mr. George Diaz.

04:55.587 --> 04:57.347
- Mr. Diaz. Welcome.
- You gave my real name?

04:57.380 --> 04:58.441
Of course I gave them your real name.

04:58.465 --> 04:59.650
- What about the paparazzi?
- It's a pleasure to have you.

04:59.674 --> 05:00.735
Paparazzi? We're on an island.

05:00.759 --> 05:01.861
Of course I gave them your real name.

05:01.885 --> 05:02.969
Welcome to hawthorn.

05:03.053 --> 05:06.097
Mr. Ledford and miss westervelt?

05:07.349 --> 05:08.517
(Stutters) Oh, no. Um...

05:09.059 --> 05:10.339
Sorry, yeah, no. That was, uh...

05:10.977 --> 05:12.737
That's not miss...
She had a change of plans,

05:12.771 --> 05:14.856
so miss westervelt couldn't...
This is miss...

05:15.941 --> 05:16.942
I'm Margot.

05:17.025 --> 05:18.865
- Hi. Nice to meet you.
- (Tyler clears throat)

05:23.198 --> 05:25.492
Margot. Welcome.

05:26.076 --> 05:29.454
We'll endeavor to make your evening
as pleasant as possible.

05:30.038 --> 05:31.248
- Thanks.
- Right this way.

05:31.331 --> 05:32.332
Thanks.

05:33.375 --> 05:34.918
Oh, my god. I'm so sorry.

05:35.001 --> 05:36.771
That was really awkward.
I'm sorry. That was not...

05:36.795 --> 05:38.588
- No, no. Fine.
- (Sighs)

05:38.672 --> 05:39.673
Don't worry about it.

05:40.131 --> 05:41.841
Tyler: (Clears throat) Sorry.

05:45.095 --> 05:47.681
Elsa: Mr. Leibrandt.
Mrs. Leibrandt. Welcome.

05:47.764 --> 05:49.951
Richard: We'll just go straight
to the restaurant, if you don't mind.

05:49.975 --> 05:52.561
Anne: We've seen the tour
many, many times.

05:52.644 --> 05:53.895
Elsa: Yes, yes, you have.

05:54.688 --> 05:58.149
My esteemed guests
can continue their conversation this way.

05:58.233 --> 06:00.360
Thank you. Please follow me.

06:01.152 --> 06:03.613
So, like, what are you working on now?

06:03.697 --> 06:06.032
Oh, hey, thanks for asking.
See, people still know me.

06:06.491 --> 06:08.868
I'm moving into
the presenter phase of my career.

06:08.952 --> 06:10.412
You know? Do me.

06:12.539 --> 06:19.337
Elsa: Hawthorn island
comprises 12 acres of forest and pasture.

06:19.421 --> 06:21.965
We have the bounty
of the sea surrounding us.

06:22.048 --> 06:23.049
Oh, yeah, right.

06:23.133 --> 06:26.344
Out there, right now,
we are harvesting scallops.

06:26.428 --> 06:27.470
You'll eat them tonight.

06:27.554 --> 06:29.514
- No, get out. Oh, shoot!
- Yes.

06:29.598 --> 06:31.433
Hey! (Laughing)

06:31.516 --> 06:33.852
Hey, harvest harder, me dude!

06:33.935 --> 06:35.270
We're starving!

06:35.353 --> 06:36.479
(All laughing)

06:36.563 --> 06:37.814
Oh, my goodness.

06:37.897 --> 06:41.818
I do like the sense of it
being a sort of biome of culinary ideas.

06:41.901 --> 06:44.362
Right. Like, it functions like
an epicurean salon.

06:44.904 --> 06:46.781
No, I like biome better I think.

06:46.865 --> 06:48.384
Biome's better. Yeah, yeah.
I mean, that's... yeah.

06:48.408 --> 06:51.703
Margot: We have reached
the base camp of mount bullshit.

06:51.786 --> 06:53.038
This is insane. (Chuckles)

06:53.121 --> 06:54.956
(Dramatic music playing)

07:00.920 --> 07:01.921
Smell that.

07:02.589 --> 07:03.590
Both: Mmm.

07:06.635 --> 07:07.802
Soren: We're gonna be hungry.

07:07.886 --> 07:09.488
George: Yeah, I'm a huge
embarrassing foodie.

07:09.512 --> 07:10.597
I love this stuff.

07:10.680 --> 07:12.724
And I'm close, personal
friends with the chef.

07:12.807 --> 07:13.933
Soren: Okay, player.

07:14.017 --> 07:16.645
Elsa: Our smokehouse
is in the nordic tradition.

07:17.062 --> 07:19.773
We use the meat of dairy cows only,

07:20.982 --> 07:26.738
which we age for an astonishing 152 days
to relax the protein strands.

07:26.821 --> 07:29.074
Bryce: Ah, yes. Yes.
Ted: Can we pop in here?

07:29.491 --> 07:31.761
- Dude, I read about one of these online.
- Oh, yeah? Can I check it out?

07:31.785 --> 07:32.887
- Dave: Korean barbeque.
- Yes.

07:32.911 --> 07:35.246
But please, do not touch our proteins.
They're immature.

07:35.330 --> 07:38.166
So, what happens if
you serve it on the 153rd day?

07:38.249 --> 07:40.335
Does all hell break loose, or...

07:40.418 --> 07:43.004
Well, I suppose the bacteria
would introduce itself

07:43.088 --> 07:46.591
to the consumer's bloodstream
and spread into their spinal membranes,

07:46.675 --> 07:49.177
after which point, he or she
would become incapacitated

07:49.260 --> 07:50.970
and shortly thereafter expire.

07:51.471 --> 07:53.264
So, yes, all hell would break loose.

07:53.556 --> 07:56.059
(All chuckle nervously)

07:56.142 --> 07:57.477
Good thing we're pros, yes?

07:59.646 --> 08:00.706
George: I'd like to work for her.

08:00.730 --> 08:01.731
Soren: Yeah. Dave: Cool.

08:01.815 --> 08:03.108
Elsa: This is where we live.

08:04.442 --> 08:08.071
Bryce: Yeah? What, you actually live here?
All of you?

08:08.613 --> 08:09.698
Elsa: All of us.

08:09.781 --> 08:10.949
Except chef.

08:11.032 --> 08:12.701
- Yeah, well...
- Lillian: Oof.

08:13.535 --> 08:14.953
<i>Esprit de corps.</i> No?

08:15.036 --> 08:17.956
Elsa: No, Mr. Feldman.
It's very much more than that.

08:18.873 --> 08:20.125
Here we are family.

08:20.458 --> 08:23.128
Each day starts at 6:00,
with five hours of prep work.

08:23.211 --> 08:25.171
We harvest. We ferment.

08:25.588 --> 08:27.549
We slaughter. We marinate.

08:28.091 --> 08:30.135
We liquify. We spherify.

08:30.552 --> 08:31.761
We gel.

08:31.845 --> 08:33.429
- They, um... they "gel?"
- Yeah.

08:33.513 --> 08:34.514
We gel.

08:35.724 --> 08:37.933
Dinner is typically
four hours and 25 minutes.

08:38.017 --> 08:39.936
Each day ends at well past
2:00 in the morning.

08:40.019 --> 08:41.580
So yes, it's best that we all live here.

08:41.604 --> 08:43.148
You guys ever get burned out, or...

08:43.773 --> 08:46.651
- "Burned out?"
- Yeah, sorry, sorry.

08:46.735 --> 08:49.446
Like, tired of doing the same thing?

08:49.529 --> 08:52.490
Chef holds himself
to the highest standard, and so do we.

08:53.742 --> 08:57.412
We never burn anything unless by design,
to make delicious.

08:58.163 --> 09:00.331
Now, who's hungry?

09:01.332 --> 09:02.768
Margot: There is food
at the end of this, right?

09:02.792 --> 09:04.419
Ted: Boat food to dinner table.

09:04.502 --> 09:05.795
Elsa.

09:05.879 --> 09:06.921
Excuse me.

09:07.338 --> 09:08.757
Elsa. Elsa, hi.

09:08.840 --> 09:09.841
Uh, who lives there?

09:10.425 --> 09:11.426
Chef.

09:11.509 --> 09:12.761
Oh, can we see that?

09:14.804 --> 09:18.057
Even we are not allowed
inside chef's cottage, Mr. Ledford.

09:21.478 --> 09:22.937
Margot: (Shushes) Come on.

09:23.021 --> 09:26.149
We mustn't disturb
the lord high emperor of sustenance.

09:26.232 --> 09:27.275
Yeah, all right.

09:28.193 --> 09:29.879
Isn't the goat the greatest of
all time, though?

09:29.903 --> 09:31.321
No, no, no. Back in the day...

09:32.113 --> 09:33.753
George: You think he'd pick that big guy?

09:34.824 --> 09:37.160
(Indistinct chatter and laughter)

09:38.661 --> 09:41.039
So, I think that maybe
we'll just time the post.

09:41.122 --> 09:42.874
Oh, yeah? Bring you to the best spots?

09:42.957 --> 09:44.393
Felicity: Yes, well,
I book the best spots.

09:44.417 --> 09:45.603
- So you tell me.
- George: With my name.

09:45.627 --> 09:46.669
Felicity: Well, I...

09:48.838 --> 09:49.881
Hi, again.

09:49.964 --> 09:51.132
Bryce: Gentlemen, parfait?

09:52.133 --> 09:53.426
Felicity: Oh! Look at that view.

09:54.385 --> 09:55.512
Wanna take a picture?

09:55.595 --> 09:57.388
(Classical music playing)

10:09.734 --> 10:10.944
(Indistinct chatter)

10:12.946 --> 10:14.197
Soren: Where we going, chief?

10:14.280 --> 10:16.491
Here. Switch seats with me.

10:17.158 --> 10:19.077
- Miss...
- Mills.

10:19.160 --> 10:22.413
Ms. Mills. You will be sitting
in miss westervelt's seat.

10:23.039 --> 10:24.600
Richard: Just...
You should have the better view.

10:24.624 --> 10:26.751
Anne: Well, I don't... (Stutters)

10:26.835 --> 10:28.253
I don't need a better view.

10:28.336 --> 10:29.396
Richard: No,
I'm gonna look at the kitchen.

10:29.420 --> 10:31.756
Margot: Thank you!
Richard: The rosé, we'll get first.

10:31.840 --> 10:32.841
Enjoy.

10:41.474 --> 10:45.228
Elsa: Feel free to observe
the cooks as they innovate.

10:46.938 --> 10:51.234
But please, do not photograph our dishes.

10:51.317 --> 10:54.279
Chef strongly feels that
the beauty in his creations

10:54.362 --> 10:56.197
lies in their ephemeral nature.

10:56.281 --> 10:57.699
Here, come on. We can't miss this.

10:59.200 --> 11:00.910
Margot: Oh. Um...

11:03.872 --> 11:05.415
Do you make that with a pacojet?

11:06.416 --> 11:08.084
- Exactly right, sir.
- Mmm.

11:08.668 --> 11:12.797
You know, a pacojet can produce
a powderized, uh, snow-like texture.

11:12.881 --> 11:15.174
- Cool.
- Yeah. I have one.

11:15.258 --> 11:17.176
You really know your stuff, Mr. Ledford.

11:18.511 --> 11:19.679
You know my name?

11:19.762 --> 11:21.723
Oh, we like to know
everyone who dines with us.

11:23.266 --> 11:25.327
And chef, is he around here somewhere?
I'd love to talk with him.

11:25.351 --> 11:26.853
Why don't you take your seat?

11:28.521 --> 11:29.522
We're about to serve.

11:30.440 --> 11:32.150
Oh, right. Yeah, okay. Thank you.

11:33.359 --> 11:34.545
- Tyler: Wow.
- More lambrusco, madam?

11:34.569 --> 11:36.905
Tyler: Well, the attention
to detail, it's like, fuck!

11:36.988 --> 11:38.072
And he knew my name, babe!

11:38.156 --> 11:39.675
Yeah. I noticed you didn't ask his name.

11:39.699 --> 11:40.700
Yeah, well, you know.

11:43.411 --> 11:44.412
(Shushes)

11:44.495 --> 11:45.496
Tyler: There he is.

11:57.592 --> 11:59.761
Fuck me. Is he looking at me?

12:06.267 --> 12:08.394
(Unsettling music playing)

12:18.321 --> 12:19.697
(Indistinct chatter)

12:22.283 --> 12:25.036
Ted: Bland? You call that bland?
Lillian: Well, it is bland.

12:25.119 --> 12:26.388
Soren: You like the winter, don't you?

12:26.412 --> 12:27.681
Dave: I don't actually...
Soren: Fucking freak.

12:27.705 --> 12:30.059
Server: Here we have a compressed
and pickled cucumber melon,

12:30.083 --> 12:31.918
milk snow, and charred lace.

12:32.001 --> 12:33.044
- Soren: Thanks.
- Enjoy.

12:34.796 --> 12:38.049
Oh! This ongoing obsession with snow.

12:38.132 --> 12:40.718
It's officially a plague,
and no one is immune.

12:45.556 --> 12:47.350
Can you taste a little goat?

12:47.850 --> 12:49.435
Right at the end. A little kid.

12:49.519 --> 12:50.561
She said milk.

12:51.187 --> 12:52.230
I wonder.

12:52.313 --> 12:54.333
- She did not say of what species.
- Ted: She did not.

12:54.357 --> 12:55.668
Felicity: I want to hear
your pitch for the show,

12:55.692 --> 12:58.069
but first I would like to say "thank you"

12:58.152 --> 13:00.130
- for the last two years.
- (Phone camera shutter clicks)

13:00.154 --> 13:02.073
Felicity: This opportunity has been, uh...

13:02.156 --> 13:03.356
George: The best of your life?

13:03.408 --> 13:04.909
Let's have to many, many, many more.

13:04.993 --> 13:07.388
Come on. I'm trying to do a goodbye toast.
Can you please just let me do that?

13:07.412 --> 13:09.014
- No, it ain't. No, it ain't.
- Yes, it is.

13:09.038 --> 13:10.873
- I'm starting a new position.
- Oh, my god!

13:10.957 --> 13:12.750
Felicity: My mom got me a job at Sony.

13:12.834 --> 13:14.127
I told you this two weeks ago.

13:14.210 --> 13:16.045
Here's my, uh, work phone.

13:17.005 --> 13:18.107
Here's the production
company's credit card.

13:18.131 --> 13:19.525
What are you doin'? Non-transferrable.

13:19.549 --> 13:21.801
And here is the key to your house in la...

13:21.884 --> 13:23.946
- I don't have pockets.
- Your apartment in New York

13:23.970 --> 13:26.115
and your other apartment in New York
that your wife doesn't know about.

13:26.139 --> 13:27.223
Bryce: How's Amanda?

13:27.306 --> 13:28.367
Felicity: Take it because
I won't be there on Monday.

13:28.391 --> 13:30.143
(Chuckles) We're doing this?

13:30.226 --> 13:31.328
The "talking about our lives" thing?

13:31.352 --> 13:33.330
- Is that it? We're close?
- Hey, I don't want to either.

13:33.354 --> 13:35.273
- But shouldn't we?
- Dave: Well, do we have to?

13:35.356 --> 13:38.609
Well, not good, Bryce. Okay?

13:38.693 --> 13:40.778
Me and Amanda are not good. It's not good.

13:40.862 --> 13:42.113
Bryce: Are you at fault?

13:42.196 --> 13:43.966
No, it was her fault.
She made me text her coworker.

13:43.990 --> 13:45.950
Yeah, fucking of course
it's my fault, bro.

13:46.034 --> 13:47.243
I'm an asshole.

13:47.326 --> 13:48.578
Well, at least we have work.

13:48.661 --> 13:50.621
- Dave: And money.
- To work and money.

13:50.705 --> 13:52.040
- Dave: Yeah, baby.
- Yeah, baby.

13:52.123 --> 13:53.291
We're pathetic, aren't we?

13:53.374 --> 13:55.094
Soren: Oh, my god, dude.
Somebody, shoot us.

13:56.210 --> 13:58.963
(Both speaking Spanish)

13:59.464 --> 14:00.899
Felicity: (In English)
No, I'm not gonna have...

14:00.923 --> 14:02.484
Jesus Christ. I want to live
inside this thing.

14:02.508 --> 14:06.596
Mmm. So it's okay
that I'm not as into this as you are?

14:06.679 --> 14:07.722
Oh, no, no. It's good.

14:07.805 --> 14:09.390
I'm sitting with the coolest girl here.

14:09.474 --> 14:11.559
Okay, so what is it with this food thing?

14:12.101 --> 14:14.896
I don't know. It's like,
you know how people idolize,

14:14.979 --> 14:16.522
you know, athletes, and musicians,

14:16.606 --> 14:18.399
- and painters, and stuff?
- Mmm-hmm.

14:18.483 --> 14:20.753
Yeah, those people are idiots.
What they do, it doesn't matter.

14:20.777 --> 14:23.362
They play with inflatable balls
and ukuleles and shit.

14:23.446 --> 14:24.655
Chefs,

14:24.739 --> 14:26.991
they play with the raw materials
of life itself.

14:27.492 --> 14:28.743
And death itself. It's...

14:29.494 --> 14:32.955
I mean, I've watched every fucking episode
of <i>chef's table</i> two or three times.

14:33.039 --> 14:34.791
I've watched slowik's 20 times.

14:34.874 --> 14:38.961
I've watched him explain the exact moment
a green strawberry is perfectly unripe.

14:39.045 --> 14:40.922
I've watched him plate a raw scallop

14:41.005 --> 14:43.424
during its last
dying contraction of muscle.

14:43.508 --> 14:45.343
It's art on the edge of the abyss,

14:45.426 --> 14:47.428
which is where god works, too.
It's the same.

14:47.512 --> 14:49.263
That was beautifully put, Tyler.

14:49.347 --> 14:51.224
- Stop. Don't. No.
- No! I'm being serious.

14:51.307 --> 14:54.644
I think I'm, um, starting to get it.

14:54.727 --> 14:56.437
- Really?
- Yeah. A little.

15:02.443 --> 15:04.445
(Bell dings)

15:06.823 --> 15:09.450
(Suspenseful music playing)

15:16.791 --> 15:18.126
Okay.

15:18.209 --> 15:19.252
Yes, chef.

15:20.169 --> 15:21.587
(Classical music playing)

15:35.268 --> 15:36.394
(Classical music fades)

15:44.944 --> 15:45.945
Slowik: Good evening.

15:46.404 --> 15:47.488
Good evening.

15:47.572 --> 15:49.092
- Good evening. Hello.
- George: Hello.

15:50.199 --> 15:51.492
Welcome to hawthorn.

15:52.201 --> 15:53.536
I am Julian slowik,

15:53.619 --> 15:56.080
and tonight it'll be
our pleasure to feed you.

15:56.164 --> 15:57.415
The curtain rises.

15:57.874 --> 16:01.836
Slowik: Over the next few hours
you will ingest fat,

16:02.336 --> 16:05.882
salt, sugar, protein,

16:06.382 --> 16:08.885
bacteria, fungi,

16:09.635 --> 16:11.512
various plants and animals,

16:11.596 --> 16:14.724
and, at times, entire ecosystems.

16:15.641 --> 16:18.644
But I have to beg of you one thing.

16:18.728 --> 16:19.729
It's just one.

16:20.438 --> 16:22.481
Do not eat.

16:23.524 --> 16:24.609
Is he serious?

16:25.234 --> 16:26.235
Taste.

16:28.070 --> 16:29.238
Savor.

16:29.322 --> 16:30.323
Relish.

16:31.199 --> 16:34.076
Consider every morsel
that you place inside your mouth.

16:36.204 --> 16:37.246
Be mindful.

16:38.206 --> 16:39.624
But do not eat.

16:40.958 --> 16:44.128
Our menu is too precious
for that. (Chuckles softly)

16:44.212 --> 16:45.338
And look around you.

16:45.630 --> 16:48.216
Here we are on this island.

16:49.383 --> 16:50.384
Accept.

16:51.844 --> 16:53.137
Accept all of it.

16:54.055 --> 16:56.265
And forgive.

16:58.142 --> 16:59.518
And on that note,

17:00.394 --> 17:01.395
food!

17:01.979 --> 17:03.940
George: Yeah, yeah. Bring it, bring it.

17:05.273 --> 17:06.525
Here they come.

17:07.777 --> 17:10.320
Lillian: Oh, wow.
It's like a marching band.

17:13.782 --> 17:16.953
Slowik: Our first course
is called "the island."

17:17.036 --> 17:19.372
On your plate are plants
from around the island,

17:19.454 --> 17:21.540
placed on rocks from the shore,

17:21.624 --> 17:24.252
covered in barely frozen,
filtered seawater

17:24.335 --> 17:26.796
which will flavor the dish as it melts.

17:27.296 --> 17:29.024
You know, this is what the guy
was fishing for earlier...

17:29.048 --> 17:30.049
Slowik: Sorry?

17:31.384 --> 17:32.468
Tyler: Um...

17:33.261 --> 17:34.262
Sorry, chef.

17:35.888 --> 17:38.724
It's perfectly all right.
Yes, they are those very same scallops.

17:39.558 --> 17:42.186
Now, here is what you must
remember about this dish.

17:42.853 --> 17:46.190
We, the people on this island,
are not important.

17:47.275 --> 17:51.821
The island and the nutrients it provides
exist in their most perfect state

17:52.321 --> 17:56.909
without us gathering them
or manipulating them, or digesting them.

17:57.368 --> 18:00.871
What happens inside this room
is meaningless

18:00.955 --> 18:03.999
compared to what happens
outside in nature,

18:04.625 --> 18:06.585
in the soil, in the water,

18:07.211 --> 18:08.254
in the air.

18:09.880 --> 18:12.967
We are but a frightened nanosecond.

18:15.052 --> 18:16.971
Nature is timeless.

18:19.390 --> 18:20.391
Enjoy.

18:21.267 --> 18:22.685
(Guests clapping)

18:22.768 --> 18:23.894
That's a cheery thought.

18:24.729 --> 18:25.730
(Sniffles)

18:27.440 --> 18:28.649
Are you crying?

18:29.608 --> 18:32.737
It's just that I find it all very moving.

18:32.820 --> 18:34.238
It's all so beautiful. I just...

18:34.780 --> 18:36.240
It's almost too beautiful to eat.

18:37.408 --> 18:39.219
- (Phone camera shutter clicking)
- Margot: You know,

18:39.243 --> 18:41.203
the nicest restaurant
in my hometown was...

18:41.287 --> 18:42.887
You don't think chef's mad at me, right?

18:43.873 --> 18:44.915
For the scallop thing?

18:44.999 --> 18:47.001
You don't have to call him "chef," Tyler.

18:47.084 --> 18:49.420
I'm pretty sure he doesn't even know
about your existence.

18:49.503 --> 18:50.880
I kind of want him to...

18:51.297 --> 18:53.966
- Like you? (Chuckles)
- Yeah. Kinda.

18:54.050 --> 18:55.343
Tyler, you're the customer.

18:55.426 --> 18:57.303
You're paying him to serve you.

18:57.928 --> 19:00.306
It doesn't really matter
whether he likes you or not.

19:00.389 --> 19:01.724
Right. Wait. What does that mean?

19:01.807 --> 19:02.933
Mmm. Nothing.

19:03.476 --> 19:05.853
Relax. Just eat your rock.

19:05.936 --> 19:08.564
And to pair, from our friends
at Caroline morey,

19:08.647 --> 19:10.232
a chassagne-montrachet

19:10.858 --> 19:12.902
premier cru from 2014.

19:13.361 --> 19:15.154
Not just a single vineyard.

19:15.237 --> 19:17.198
A single row of vines.

19:17.281 --> 19:18.949
- Wow. Perfect.
- It's magical.

19:19.617 --> 19:21.994
Ted: Thoughts?
I'm really feeling this is quite...

19:22.078 --> 19:24.246
It's half-great. It's there in moments.

19:24.330 --> 19:25.331
There in moments.

19:25.414 --> 19:27.249
There's a neediness
to the plating, you know.

19:27.333 --> 19:28.773
I mean, it's been tweezered to fuck.

19:28.834 --> 19:31.128
But the flavors are there.
It's very clean.

19:31.212 --> 19:33.339
It's very, um, thalassic.

19:34.548 --> 19:36.258
- "Thalassic?"
- oceanic.

19:36.342 --> 19:38.177
Thalassa was the primeval
spirit of the sea.

19:38.260 --> 19:39.387
Oh, thalassa and pontus.

19:39.470 --> 19:41.263
- Yes, yes, yes.
- Correct. So, we are...

19:43.057 --> 19:44.558
We're eating the ocean.

19:45.476 --> 19:46.852
We're eating the ocean.

19:46.936 --> 19:48.312
- Yeah.
- Yes.

19:51.690 --> 19:53.192
- Felicity: How is it?
- Mmm.

19:54.193 --> 19:55.194
It's good.

19:55.277 --> 19:57.381
You can't just say "good"
for the show. You have to...

19:57.405 --> 19:58.614
You have to embellish.

19:59.573 --> 20:01.593
Oh, my god. For crying out loud.
It's not brain surgery, okay?

20:01.617 --> 20:03.887
- It's a goddamn travel-food show.
- I know. Okay, so then, do it.

20:03.911 --> 20:06.414
Yeah, yeah. So pitch it to me.

20:06.497 --> 20:08.617
- Okay, so we go to Italy, right?
- Felicity: Mmm-hmm.

20:08.916 --> 20:13.212
We shoot me in Capri pants
on a pastel green Vespa,

20:13.295 --> 20:16.590
driving around to get
to some giuseppe's farm with cheese.

20:16.674 --> 20:19.051
I eat the cheese, and then...

20:19.135 --> 20:20.344
There's a close-up of me.

20:20.428 --> 20:24.223
And I close my eyes, and I fake an orgasm,
and then off to South Africa,

20:24.306 --> 20:28.018
and then, I maybe...
I talk about how racism is not so cool,

20:28.102 --> 20:29.979
and bingo bongo, Emmy time.

20:30.062 --> 20:31.289
- That's it?
- Okay? Can I eat now?

20:31.313 --> 20:33.583
That's what you're gonna pitch
to three streaming services on Monday?

20:33.607 --> 20:34.668
Yeah. Pretty much. That's that.

20:34.692 --> 20:36.652
Yeah. Jesus fucking Christ.
That's a disaster.

20:36.735 --> 20:38.946
I don't think you can go
to South Africa with a dui.

20:39.572 --> 20:41.740
- Soren: You like this?
- The otter food?

20:41.824 --> 20:42.992
Yeah. It's solid.

20:43.075 --> 20:44.511
Soren: I mean,
I've had shellfish just as good

20:44.535 --> 20:47.121
with my chef at home, Ricardo.
You know Ricardo. He's amazing.

20:47.204 --> 20:48.581
Bryce: Incredible.
Soren: Whatever.

20:48.664 --> 20:50.344
At least we can say
we've been here, right?

20:50.749 --> 20:52.710
My dad used to say
that you buy the experience.

20:53.836 --> 20:57.173
Richard: I mean, this looks like
a suburban landscaping.

20:57.631 --> 20:58.632
What the fuck?

21:01.844 --> 21:04.221
I saw Perry at delaurenti's the other day.

21:09.643 --> 21:10.644
Oh?

21:12.855 --> 21:13.856
How is he?

21:15.941 --> 21:16.942
You know...

21:17.443 --> 21:18.486
Perry.

21:22.531 --> 21:23.574
Thank you.

21:26.869 --> 21:28.496
Slowik: I want plating in five!

21:28.579 --> 21:29.788
Cooking team: Yes, chef!

21:35.586 --> 21:36.921
(Bell dings)

21:41.800 --> 21:42.801
(Claps)

21:43.886 --> 21:45.012
Is he gonna keep doing that?

21:45.846 --> 21:50.684
Bread has existed in some form
for over 12,000 years,

21:51.477 --> 21:53.020
especially amongst the poor.

21:54.230 --> 21:55.272
Flour and water.

21:55.898 --> 21:56.982
What could be simpler?

21:57.316 --> 22:02.571
Even today, grain represents
65% of all agriculture.

22:03.489 --> 22:05.824
Fruits and vegetables only 6%.

22:06.784 --> 22:12.373
Ancient Greek peasants dipped their stale,
measly bread in wine for breakfast.

22:13.332 --> 22:15.709
And how did Jesus teach us to pray

22:15.793 --> 22:18.420
- if not to beg for our daily bread?
- Beg for our daily bread.

22:19.088 --> 22:22.967
It is, and has always been,
the food of the common man.

22:23.509 --> 22:27.137
But you, my dear guests,
are not the common man.

22:27.221 --> 22:28.222
And so tonight...

22:29.515 --> 22:30.766
you get no bread.

22:30.849 --> 22:32.017
(Bell dings)

22:39.608 --> 22:41.694
Lillian: He must be joking.
Ted: He's joking.

22:41.777 --> 22:42.903
(Guests laugh)

22:43.946 --> 22:46.132
- This is next-level.
- Felicity: How are you not gonna...

22:46.156 --> 22:47.157
Wow, he's not kidding.

22:47.241 --> 22:49.886
Not gonna serve bread at a restaurant
known for their bread. That's sweet.

22:49.910 --> 22:50.953
- What?
- Anne: Thank you.

22:51.829 --> 22:53.747
It's not a fake-out, is it?

22:53.831 --> 22:55.583
- What?
- Ted: No.

22:56.292 --> 22:57.710
It's gotta be a bit.

23:00.004 --> 23:01.046
Are you fuckin' serious?

23:01.505 --> 23:02.631
Slowik: In this spirit,

23:02.715 --> 23:06.552
please enjoy
the unaccompanied accompaniments.

23:07.094 --> 23:09.072
Felicity: "The bread
you will not be eating tonight

23:09.096 --> 23:11.807
"was made from a heritage wheat
called red fife,

23:11.890 --> 23:15.686
"crafted with our partners
at the tehachapi grain project

23:15.769 --> 23:17.521
"devoted to preserving heirloom grains."

23:17.605 --> 23:19.481
- This is insane.
- George: Mmm!

23:20.524 --> 23:23.402
I gotta say that the shit around
the total absence of the bread

23:23.485 --> 23:25.446
is, like, really good.

23:25.821 --> 23:28.073
I mean, it's a little outrageous,
isn't it?

23:28.157 --> 23:30.951
It's fiendish, really.

23:31.452 --> 23:35.122
I mean, he's always been keenly aware
of food as a history of class...

23:35.205 --> 23:36.707
I mean, as have I.

23:36.790 --> 23:37.791
Sure.

23:38.459 --> 23:44.423
Though I will say that this emulsion
does look slightly split.

23:45.007 --> 23:46.008
Ted: Yeah.

23:46.508 --> 23:49.470
I mean, I wasn't gonna say anything.
I noticed as soon as it came down.

23:49.553 --> 23:51.430
It's broken. It's broken.

23:51.764 --> 23:54.391
Yeah, which is really...
I mean, you really...

23:56.477 --> 24:00.064
You really shouldn't see that in
a restaurant of this quality. There it is.

24:00.147 --> 24:01.482
- Well, there it is.
- Yeah.

24:01.565 --> 24:04.860
Oh, my god. I mean,
it's next-level badassery.

24:04.943 --> 24:07.154
The way he weaves in
historical allegories.

24:07.571 --> 24:10.240
I mean, the game is trying to guess
what the overarching theme

24:10.324 --> 24:11.575
of the entire meal is gonna be.

24:11.659 --> 24:12.910
You won't know until the end.

24:13.369 --> 24:15.204
Wait. You... you like this?

24:15.287 --> 24:16.413
Mmm-hmm. Oh, yeah.

24:16.497 --> 24:18.082
He's basically insulting you.

24:18.666 --> 24:20.501
No, no, no. You don't get it.

24:20.584 --> 24:21.627
It's a concept.

24:21.710 --> 24:23.504
I know what a concept is, Tyler.

24:23.587 --> 24:24.963
Trust me. He's telling a story.

24:25.047 --> 24:26.566
That's what makes his food so exciting.

24:26.590 --> 24:29.134
He's not just a chef. He's a storyteller.

24:29.218 --> 24:30.695
And he doesn't give a fuck
about the rules.

24:30.719 --> 24:32.864
Call me the girl next door,
but maybe there are some rules

24:32.888 --> 24:35.307
that you should give a fuck about,
like, I don't know,

24:35.391 --> 24:37.142
giving food to people at a restaurant.

24:38.811 --> 24:42.064
Dearest, no one would ever
call you the girl next door.

24:42.147 --> 24:43.524
Lillian: I make my own bread.

24:43.607 --> 24:45.192
- You do? I didn't know that.
- Yeah.

24:45.275 --> 24:47.194
Oh, yeah. I mean, it's very rustic.

24:47.277 --> 24:49.405
It's peasant style. Yeasty.

24:49.905 --> 24:51.240
What kind of yeast are you using?

24:52.282 --> 24:53.909
Oh, I make my own from apples.

24:53.992 --> 24:56.370
Well, of course you make
your own yeast from apples.

24:57.204 --> 24:59.081
- You wicked thing.
- (Elsa clears throat)

24:59.581 --> 25:01.125
- Elsa: Ms. Bloom?
- Mmm?

25:01.208 --> 25:03.293
Elsa: Here is another broken emulsion.

25:04.169 --> 25:06.088
Courtesy of chef slowik.

25:06.463 --> 25:08.257
(Amusing music playing)

25:11.802 --> 25:12.862
Soren: Hello. Bryce: Excuse me.

25:12.886 --> 25:14.471
Is everything to your liking, sir?

25:14.555 --> 25:17.433
Well, actually, no. Thanks for asking.

25:18.016 --> 25:19.518
Uh, I mean, look, the food's great

25:19.601 --> 25:21.478
and we totally
get all the conceptual stuff.

25:21.562 --> 25:23.397
But could we please get a little bread?

25:23.480 --> 25:25.542
You know, and some gluten-free
for my friend as well?

25:25.566 --> 25:26.686
- No.
- (Amusing music stops)

25:27.484 --> 25:28.485
"No?"

25:29.111 --> 25:30.195
No.

25:30.279 --> 25:31.947
(Chuckles nervously) Okay.

25:32.030 --> 25:35.033
This is all very clever,
and I didn't want to pull this card,

25:35.117 --> 25:38.036
but you know who we are, right?

25:38.871 --> 25:39.872
Yes.

25:40.080 --> 25:42.124
You do? You know who we are?

25:42.458 --> 25:43.459
I know who you are.

25:43.542 --> 25:46.587
Mmm-hmm. Then you know
we work with Doug verrick, right?

25:47.004 --> 25:48.672
No, you work for Mr. Verrick.

25:49.173 --> 25:50.424
- Exactly.
- Oh, fuck it.

25:50.507 --> 25:53.260
And so you know,
we all play on the same team.

25:53.343 --> 25:56.054
So, just slip us a little bread.

25:56.138 --> 25:58.265
- Please.
- We won't tell a soul, lady.

25:58.348 --> 26:00.267
- I promise, okay?
- No.

26:01.435 --> 26:03.228
- (Soren sighs)
- Did you say, "no?"

26:03.687 --> 26:05.189
I said, "no." Yes.

26:05.272 --> 26:06.356
- Okay.
- Okay.

26:06.440 --> 26:07.691
- Wow.
- Okay.

26:08.192 --> 26:09.777
That will be all, though. Thanks.

26:11.195 --> 26:12.196
May I?

26:12.613 --> 26:14.364
You don't have to do... okay.

26:17.493 --> 26:20.078
(Whispering) You will eat
less than you desire

26:20.162 --> 26:21.747
and more than you deserve.

26:24.291 --> 26:25.834
It's a pleasure to serve you.

26:26.794 --> 26:29.338
Ted: Well, I remain in ketosis,
so that's good news.

26:29.797 --> 26:32.549
Tyler: Without the bread,
it really focuses you.

26:32.966 --> 26:35.093
It's so fucking good. Embalm me in this.

26:37.179 --> 26:39.014
- Are you not gonna try it?
- No.

26:39.097 --> 26:40.349
- No?
- No.

26:40.432 --> 26:41.433
This is great stuff.

26:41.517 --> 26:43.602
- I'll take it and eat it.
- Yeah, go for it.

26:43.685 --> 26:45.395
(All gasp)

26:45.938 --> 26:47.258
Tyler: That was a total accident.

26:47.564 --> 26:49.044
Margot: It happens to the best of us.

26:51.652 --> 26:52.736
Tyler: I'm...

26:53.278 --> 26:54.863
I'm sorry. That was...

26:54.947 --> 26:56.156
No, I'm so sorry.

26:59.493 --> 27:00.911
You haven't touched your food.

27:02.079 --> 27:03.205
There...

27:03.288 --> 27:04.665
There is no food.

27:05.249 --> 27:06.917
Well, no. This is food.

27:08.043 --> 27:11.296
So, um, lots more food to come.

27:11.380 --> 27:13.191
- Don't wanna fill up.
- That would not be possible.

27:13.215 --> 27:15.968
I've precisely designed
the portions to account for that.

27:16.051 --> 27:18.136
So, (chuckles) You won't fill up.

27:18.679 --> 27:19.721
Please eat.

27:20.389 --> 27:22.391
The menu only makes sense if you eat.

27:22.474 --> 27:23.767
But you told us not to eat.

27:24.476 --> 27:26.979
That is not what I meant, madam.
And you know it.

27:28.689 --> 27:31.066
Well, thank you for your concern,

27:31.149 --> 27:34.361
but I am perfectly capable
of deciding when I eat and what.

27:39.199 --> 27:40.200
Thank you.

27:42.119 --> 27:43.328
Christ, that was humiliating.

27:43.412 --> 27:44.788
Margot: "Humiliating?"
Tyler: Yeah.

27:44.872 --> 27:46.498
Margot: Tyler, the guy is a prick.

27:46.582 --> 27:47.624
Tyler: Please don't.

27:48.917 --> 27:50.377
You shouldn't be so fucking rude.

27:50.460 --> 27:52.921
Margot: What?
Tyler: He asked you to eat.

27:53.005 --> 27:54.440
Margot: I don't like it.
Tyler: Just try it.

27:54.464 --> 27:55.465
Please.

27:57.342 --> 27:58.677
(Somber music playing)

28:04.975 --> 28:06.685
Plating in three, my friends!

28:06.768 --> 28:07.811
Cooking team: Yes, chef!

28:11.690 --> 28:13.525
(Classical music playing)

28:25.245 --> 28:26.955
(Classical music fades)

28:27.039 --> 28:30.834
Sommelier: That's a 2013
Pinot noir from Ross Cobb.

28:31.209 --> 28:33.295
We hyper-decanted it
with an immersion blender

28:33.378 --> 28:35.172
to awaken it from its slumber.

28:35.255 --> 28:36.256
(Both chuckle)

28:36.340 --> 28:39.426
Slavonian oak, rich cherry
and tobacco notes,

28:39.509 --> 28:43.388
and a faint sense of longing and regret.

28:44.181 --> 28:46.224
- Yes. Enjoy.
- Margot: Longing and regret.

28:46.850 --> 28:47.935
My favorite.

28:52.689 --> 28:54.274
Anne: She's staring again.

28:54.358 --> 28:55.525
Where do we know her from?

28:55.609 --> 28:56.735
We don't.

28:56.818 --> 29:00.155
Well, she really does look like Claire.

29:00.238 --> 29:02.074
Why do you keep saying that? She doesn't.

29:02.950 --> 29:04.076
You don't think so?

29:04.159 --> 29:05.619
She's nothing like our Claire.

29:07.412 --> 29:09.206
That same faraway face.

29:09.289 --> 29:10.958
Can we not obsess? Please?

29:12.125 --> 29:14.920
I know. Hypothetically,
if you were leaving...

29:15.003 --> 29:16.522
- Felicity: Right.
- Which you're not...

29:16.546 --> 29:18.757
- Felicity: Mmm-hmm.
- What would you be leaving for?

29:18.840 --> 29:20.676
Associate development co-exec.

29:21.134 --> 29:22.260
And what the hell is that?

29:22.344 --> 29:27.015
It's in development, so I'd be developing
or helping to develop things...

29:27.099 --> 29:28.701
Why would that be better
than working for me?

29:28.725 --> 29:30.161
Well, because there's a future there.

29:30.185 --> 29:31.645
- It's a corporate...
- Right. Right.

29:31.728 --> 29:33.981
A different kind of future.
Does that make sense?

29:34.064 --> 29:35.065
At the corporate...

29:35.148 --> 29:36.584
Thank god it's all
just hypothetical anyway.

29:36.608 --> 29:37.943
(Slowik claps)

29:38.026 --> 29:40.070
The next course is called "memory."

29:40.529 --> 29:42.239
And that is what it's meant to evoke.

29:42.739 --> 29:43.740
A memory.

29:44.157 --> 29:45.951
So, let me tell you a memory of mine.

29:46.034 --> 29:49.246
When I was growing up,
a child in Waterloo, Iowa,

29:49.329 --> 29:52.040
Tuesday was taco night.

29:52.124 --> 29:53.417
George: Oh, yeah!

29:53.500 --> 29:54.543
Taco Tuesday!

29:54.626 --> 29:56.294
- George: Yeah!
- (Guests laugh)

29:56.378 --> 29:58.714
And this, here, this lady here.

29:58.797 --> 29:59.923
This is my mother.

30:00.007 --> 30:01.550
(Guests exclaim)

30:01.633 --> 30:03.051
As you can see, she's rather drunk.

30:03.635 --> 30:05.846
- (Guests chuckle)
- This is not unusual.

30:06.304 --> 30:07.973
When I was seven years old,

30:08.056 --> 30:11.476
one Tuesday, my father
came home quite drunk.

30:13.061 --> 30:14.062
Really drunk.

30:14.563 --> 30:15.939
Also, not unusual.

30:17.566 --> 30:19.609
My mother grew angry and screamed at him,

30:19.693 --> 30:22.779
at which point,
he proceeded to wrap a telephone cord

30:22.863 --> 30:24.531
around her neck and pull it tight.

30:25.699 --> 30:26.742
I wept.

30:27.325 --> 30:29.369
I screamed, I begged him to stop.

30:29.911 --> 30:30.954
To make him stop,

30:31.788 --> 30:35.459
I finally had to stab him in the thigh
with kitchen scissors.

30:40.005 --> 30:41.506
You remember that, mother, don't you?

30:42.382 --> 30:45.469
Now, I suppose I should've
stabbed him in the throat that evening.

30:45.927 --> 30:48.680
But we're not so smart when we're young.

30:49.598 --> 30:51.183
It was, as you can imagine,

30:52.017 --> 30:54.186
as a very memorable taco night.

30:56.063 --> 30:58.124
- George: Oh, thank god he didn't.
- I mean, what the fuck was that?

30:58.148 --> 30:59.983
- Theatrical.
- Felicity: You liked that?

31:00.067 --> 31:03.320
Yeah, it's a backstory to what
makes him a chef artist.

31:03.945 --> 31:06.406
Dude, that guy's got some
really dark sense of humor, bro.

31:06.490 --> 31:07.850
George: He's such an intense dude.

31:10.202 --> 31:12.412
Slowik: So, here you have

31:13.330 --> 31:16.208
house-smoked bresse
chicken thigh al pastor

31:16.291 --> 31:19.002
and our own tortillas
made with heirloom masa,

31:19.086 --> 31:21.922
- one of hawthorn's signature dishes.
- Thank you.

31:22.005 --> 31:25.175
Slowik: We change our menu constantly,
but, as Ms. Bloom knows,

31:25.258 --> 31:27.677
this has been a staple since day one.

31:28.428 --> 31:30.055
It's what you once said...

31:30.597 --> 31:31.723
Put you on the map.

31:31.807 --> 31:33.100
Slowik: Put me on the map.

31:33.183 --> 31:35.560
Precisely what map would that be...

31:36.103 --> 31:37.145
I wonder.

31:37.229 --> 31:41.274
Anyways, because we're always innovating,
and we fear irrelevance,

31:42.651 --> 31:44.319
an update to a classic.

31:44.402 --> 31:48.824
The images on the tortillas have been made
using a laser-engraving machine.

31:48.907 --> 31:50.267
It's the first time we've used it.

31:51.493 --> 31:55.163
We hope this taco night evokes
strong memories for us all.

31:55.247 --> 31:56.248
Enjoy.

31:57.165 --> 31:58.375
(Lillian chuckles softly)

31:59.835 --> 32:01.920
Well, of course he had to do a taco.

32:02.754 --> 32:03.755
Ted: Here you are.

32:06.049 --> 32:07.050
What are they, lil?

32:07.425 --> 32:08.585
Lillian: They're restaurants.

32:09.886 --> 32:10.887
Um...

32:13.932 --> 32:16.685
That I reviewed that all closed.

32:16.768 --> 32:17.769
Ted: Oh!

32:17.853 --> 32:19.104
Like a gag, then?

32:19.187 --> 32:20.939
Lillian: Um, I think so.

32:21.690 --> 32:22.890
Anne: Richard, what are these?

32:23.942 --> 32:25.819
Taco things. For the tacos.

32:25.902 --> 32:28.822
No, the pictures. They're all of us.

32:32.826 --> 32:36.788
This one is after you had the melanoma
removed from your forehead.

32:36.872 --> 32:37.998
There's the bandage.

32:38.081 --> 32:39.521
Isn't that nice? They remembered us.

32:40.500 --> 32:41.877
Margot: Tyler, is that you?

32:42.711 --> 32:45.046
Yeah. They're all me from tonight
taking fucking photos.

32:45.130 --> 32:47.966
- (Tyler sighs)
- Jesus Christ, what's with this guy?

32:48.049 --> 32:50.093
I knew it. He hates me.

32:50.177 --> 32:52.012
God damn it.
I didn't think he'd really mind.

32:52.095 --> 32:54.598
- Should I apologize?
- Apologize for what?

32:54.681 --> 32:56.641
George: Oh... (Laughs)
Felicity: What?

32:57.976 --> 32:59.227
<i>Calling doctor sunshine.</i>

32:59.728 --> 33:01.897
Oh, my god. I forgot
about that one. (Laughs)

33:01.980 --> 33:03.732
Dumb part. Bad script.

33:03.815 --> 33:04.816
Fun shoot, though.

33:04.900 --> 33:07.777
Hmm. Maybe it's a joke
'cause you're friends, right?

33:08.904 --> 33:10.655
Yeah, yeah, you know, friends.

33:11.364 --> 33:13.450
I mean, you know, do I have any friends?

33:15.243 --> 33:16.661
Soren: Wait. Um...

33:17.204 --> 33:18.644
(Stammers) Hey, guys, what the fuck?

33:20.123 --> 33:21.124
Dave: Are these...

33:22.834 --> 33:23.960
How did they get these?

33:27.339 --> 33:28.381
It's not good.

33:30.217 --> 33:31.676
Bryce: Uh, excuse me.

33:33.720 --> 33:34.721
(Clears throat)

33:35.931 --> 33:37.283
- Can I help you, sir?
- (Clears throat)

33:37.307 --> 33:38.558
Yeah. What...

33:39.267 --> 33:40.644
What the hell are these?

33:40.727 --> 33:42.187
These are tortillas.

33:42.729 --> 33:44.272
(Speaking Spanish)

33:44.356 --> 33:46.274
(In English) Yes, and what are these?

33:46.983 --> 33:48.902
These are tortillas

33:48.985 --> 33:51.780
which contain echobrite's tax records
and other documents,

33:51.863 --> 33:54.908
showing how your company
has created invoices with fake charges.

33:56.117 --> 33:57.244
How did you get these?

33:57.327 --> 34:00.121
I'm sorry, but chef
never reveals his recipes.

34:00.205 --> 34:02.290
(Scoffs) Do you know how fucked you are?

34:02.999 --> 34:05.479
We'll have this place closed
by the morning. Do you understand?

34:05.627 --> 34:08.088
Oh, no, that won't be necessary.

34:09.297 --> 34:10.297
Enjoy.

34:10.590 --> 34:13.092
Anne: And this is you and...

34:15.762 --> 34:16.846
Who is that woman?

34:20.141 --> 34:21.141
Uh...

34:24.521 --> 34:25.563
(Scoffs)

34:26.398 --> 34:28.400
Well, how the hell
should I know? It's faked.

34:28.483 --> 34:31.860
It's some sort of stupid joke.

34:31.945 --> 34:34.281
Soren: It's a fucking taco, okay?
It can't hurt you.

34:34.364 --> 34:36.284
Yeah, a fucking taco
that might hold up in court.

34:36.324 --> 34:40.245
We have plausible deniability,
and if they try to turn us in...

34:40.328 --> 34:41.389
Soren: (Snaps fingers) Right!

34:41.413 --> 34:43.581
If they turn us in,
they'd be turning verrick in.

34:43.665 --> 34:45.309
And then they'd be
just as fucked as we are.

34:45.333 --> 34:46.458
Right? So, we're fine.

34:47.460 --> 34:48.460
Right?

34:50.170 --> 34:51.607
- Yeah, we're good.
- We're fine. Yeah, fuck it.

34:51.630 --> 34:53.525
They can't take your photograph
without your consent. This is insane.

34:53.550 --> 34:55.010
Stop talking and let me think, okay?

34:55.092 --> 34:57.178
I have to make this right somehow.
I have to.

34:57.262 --> 34:58.781
Well, I'll tell you how you make it right.

34:58.805 --> 35:00.765
You send this shit back. Excuse me.

35:01.182 --> 35:03.226
- Excuse me! Sir, hi.
- Hey. Margot! Margot!

35:04.436 --> 35:06.229
Did you just fucking snap at me?

35:06.313 --> 35:08.249
Do you know how long I've been
trying to get a reservation here?

35:08.273 --> 35:09.566
No, and I don't really care.

35:09.649 --> 35:12.110
You do not send shit back
to this kitchen, you child.

35:12.652 --> 35:14.130
You thank them for
even letting you in the door.

35:14.154 --> 35:16.132
- What did you just call me?
- I called you a child

35:16.156 --> 35:17.258
because you're fucking acting like it.

35:17.282 --> 35:19.492
Tyler, you need to apologize
to me right now.

35:19.576 --> 35:20.636
You cannot speak to me that way.

35:20.660 --> 35:23.060
Actually, I can because,
ding dong, I'm the one who's paying.

35:23.121 --> 35:24.539
So maybe, shut up and eat.

35:27.375 --> 35:29.210
Mmm. Oh, my god.

35:31.796 --> 35:32.839
Oh, my god.

35:33.590 --> 35:35.592
This is incredible. You have to try this.

35:35.675 --> 35:38.178
No, thanks. Don't let me interrupt.

35:45.060 --> 35:46.061
Miss mills?

35:47.354 --> 35:48.521
How can I assist you?

35:49.647 --> 35:51.232
Just looking for the ladies' room.

35:51.316 --> 35:52.317
Right this way.

35:54.277 --> 35:55.278
Thank you.

35:56.571 --> 35:57.989
What's behind that silver door?

35:59.157 --> 36:00.283
Something very special.

36:14.130 --> 36:15.131
(Door lock clicks)

36:29.062 --> 36:30.105
(Lighter clicks)

36:33.900 --> 36:35.610
(Door unlocking)

36:35.693 --> 36:36.986
No, you can't...

36:42.283 --> 36:43.535
(Door closes, lock clicks)

36:43.618 --> 36:44.661
You shouldn't be in here.

36:44.953 --> 36:47.372
I'd like to know specifically what it was

36:47.455 --> 36:50.208
about the last course
that you did not enjoy.

36:50.291 --> 36:52.085
You've barely eaten the food.

36:52.168 --> 36:53.169
Why?

36:54.087 --> 36:56.464
I need to know. Why don't you eat?

36:56.714 --> 36:57.757
Why do you care?

36:57.841 --> 37:01.052
I take my work very seriously,
and you're not eating.

37:02.345 --> 37:03.555
And that wounds me.

37:18.445 --> 37:20.780
I guess I'm just not very hungry.

37:22.365 --> 37:23.533
I've told you who I am.

37:23.616 --> 37:26.202
I'm Julian slowik, and I am the chef here.

37:26.286 --> 37:27.662
Now, who are you?

37:29.122 --> 37:33.418
I'll ask again. Who are you?

37:33.501 --> 37:34.669
I'm Margot mills.

37:35.587 --> 37:37.255
So, where are you from, Margot?

37:38.131 --> 37:40.341
I'm from grand island, Nebraska.

37:41.050 --> 37:42.490
Now, does that make you feel better?

37:42.552 --> 37:44.613
You want the address for mom's
trailer park, you asshole?

37:44.637 --> 37:46.723
No, it's not who you want me
to think you are.

37:48.057 --> 37:49.058
Who are you?

37:49.142 --> 37:51.519
I am Margot.

37:53.354 --> 37:54.814
You shouldn't be here tonight.

37:55.732 --> 37:57.442
Please get the fuck out of my way.

38:00.862 --> 38:02.447
(Eerie music playing)

38:08.369 --> 38:10.455
(Door opens, closes)

38:18.087 --> 38:19.881
(Indistinct chatter)

38:25.929 --> 38:27.972
Still very theatrical, but minimalist,

38:28.056 --> 38:29.974
like the Japanese,
the "minimirasuto" style.

38:30.058 --> 38:31.059
(Tense music playing)

38:31.142 --> 38:33.019
Lillian: But he was being playful, right?

38:33.102 --> 38:34.145
Ted: Yes.

38:34.229 --> 38:35.498
Lillian: I mean,
let's talk about the tacos.

38:35.522 --> 38:37.232
It's a dialogue. It's playful.

38:44.030 --> 38:45.031
(Slowik claps)

38:47.283 --> 38:48.451
I'm excited.

38:48.535 --> 38:50.161
We're ready for our next course,

38:50.245 --> 38:52.247
- which I think you'll find...
- Excuse me.

38:52.664 --> 38:54.082
But what the hell is going on here?

38:54.165 --> 38:56.668
Would you just let me finish, please?
That okay?

38:58.086 --> 38:59.087
Thank you.

39:00.588 --> 39:04.926
Ladies and gentlemen,
please meet sous-chef Jeremy louden.

39:05.718 --> 39:07.554
(Clapping)

39:10.098 --> 39:12.475
Jeremy created the next dish.

39:12.559 --> 39:14.936
It's called "the mess."

39:15.687 --> 39:17.855
Originally from sparks, Nevada,

39:17.939 --> 39:21.401
Jeremy studied at the culinary institute
in Hyde park.

39:22.235 --> 39:25.446
Jeremy's goal, as he wrote
in a heartfelt letter,

39:25.530 --> 39:27.907
was to work for me here at hawthorn.

39:29.200 --> 39:30.702
Isn't that right, Jeremy?

39:30.785 --> 39:32.453
- Yes, chef.
- (Clicks tongue)

39:34.289 --> 39:35.832
Jeremy is talented.

39:37.542 --> 39:38.710
He's good.

39:39.294 --> 39:41.462
He's very good. (Sniffles)

39:42.589 --> 39:44.257
(Clicks tongue) But he's not great.

39:45.425 --> 39:47.969
He'll never be great.

39:49.220 --> 39:54.058
He desperately wants
my prestige, my job, my talent.

39:54.976 --> 39:58.396
He aspires to greatness,
but he'll never achieve it.

40:00.690 --> 40:01.691
Correct, Jeremy?

40:02.108 --> 40:03.192
Yes, chef.

40:03.276 --> 40:05.153
Like me at his age,

40:05.236 --> 40:08.615
Jeremy has forsaken everything
to achieve his goals.

40:10.116 --> 40:13.536
Like mine, his life is pressure.

40:14.329 --> 40:16.956
Pressure to put out
the best food in the world.

40:17.749 --> 40:21.753
And even when all goes right,
and the food is perfect,

40:22.378 --> 40:25.256
and the customers are happy,
and the critics are, too,

40:25.340 --> 40:28.134
there is no way to avoid the mess.

40:29.218 --> 40:31.095
The mess you make of your life,

40:31.638 --> 40:34.641
of your body, of your sanity,

40:35.558 --> 40:41.481
by giving everything you have
to pleasing people you will never know.

40:43.149 --> 40:44.150
Jeremy...

40:45.610 --> 40:46.861
do you like this life?

40:46.944 --> 40:48.696
This life that you dreamed about?

40:50.531 --> 40:51.949
- No, chef.
- Mmm-hmm.

40:52.033 --> 40:53.284
And do you want my life?

40:55.203 --> 40:56.996
Not my position, nor my talent.

40:57.080 --> 40:58.081
My life.

41:01.042 --> 41:03.044
No, chef. (Breath trembling)

41:10.718 --> 41:12.011
(Kisses)

41:17.725 --> 41:20.395
Ladies and gentlemen, your fourth course,

41:20.937 --> 41:24.107
- sous-chef Jeremy's the mess.
- (Clapping)

41:26.526 --> 41:29.112
- (Gun fires)
- (Guests scream)

41:32.156 --> 41:33.717
- George: Fuck!
- (Sinister music playing)

41:33.741 --> 41:34.909
Anne: Oh, god!

41:35.493 --> 41:36.536
Soren: What are you doing?

41:38.413 --> 41:39.455
What's wrong with you?

41:40.206 --> 41:41.290
Lillian: The fuck is that?

41:42.959 --> 41:44.711
That was a shock.
I didn't see that comin'.

41:45.336 --> 41:46.379
Soren: What the fuck, man?

41:46.462 --> 41:47.922
Slowik: Please. Sit. Sit.

41:48.005 --> 41:49.233
Sommelier: Everything's fine.
Slowik: Please, it's all fine.

41:49.257 --> 41:51.175
- What happened?
- It's just part of the menu.

41:51.259 --> 41:52.844
- It's part of the show.
- It's a show?

41:52.927 --> 41:54.470
George: That's a show? That's not...

41:54.554 --> 41:56.180
This is what you're paying for.

41:56.264 --> 41:57.449
George: That's a stunt?
(Stutters) What was that?

41:57.473 --> 41:59.726
Slowik: This is an exclusive experience.

41:59.809 --> 42:00.994
- Please just...
- Soren: What the fuck, man?

42:01.018 --> 42:02.103
Return to your seats.

42:02.854 --> 42:04.230
Thank you so much.

42:06.065 --> 42:07.066
Dave: Is he dead?

42:07.150 --> 42:08.544
Felicity: It's definitely
a squib or a packed...

42:08.568 --> 42:09.628
- Stay right there.
- Can I invite you

42:09.652 --> 42:10.921
- to sit down, please?
- Felicity: I've seen them

42:10.945 --> 42:12.505
- use it before.
- Dave: It's not funny.

42:13.156 --> 42:14.198
What the fuck?

42:14.282 --> 42:15.801
- Is this real?
- Bryce: What is happening?

42:15.825 --> 42:18.035
George: It looks so damn real.
Lillian: No, no, no.

42:18.119 --> 42:20.288
This is just theater, right?

42:20.371 --> 42:21.765
Soren: What the fuck
are you talking about, lady?

42:21.789 --> 42:23.249
He just fucking shot himself, okay?

42:23.332 --> 42:25.626
Ted: It looked very real, Lillian.
Quite real.

42:25.710 --> 42:27.962
This is... this is just theater.
It's stagecraft.

42:28.045 --> 42:29.046
Is it really?

42:29.130 --> 42:30.441
Lillian: Yeah. This is what he does.

42:30.465 --> 42:32.091
It's part of the menu.

42:34.385 --> 42:36.512
(Tense music playing)

42:52.028 --> 42:53.154
- Eat!
- (Gasps)

42:57.867 --> 42:59.035
Enjoy.

42:59.118 --> 43:00.453
(Suspenseful music playing)

43:06.501 --> 43:08.252
Fifth course on order.

43:08.336 --> 43:09.545
Cooking team: Yes, chef!

43:11.923 --> 43:13.341
Tyler, what the hell is going on?

43:13.424 --> 43:16.010
Sommelier: And here we have
a biodynamic cabernet franc

43:16.093 --> 43:19.305
from our friends at domaine breton.

43:20.097 --> 43:24.227
It has no added sulfites,
a bit of barnyard funk,

43:24.310 --> 43:28.022
and just a wonderful match
with roasted proteins. Enjoy.

43:28.105 --> 43:30.525
- We're leaving. Now.
- (Stutters) But I have to get my wrap.

43:30.608 --> 43:32.109
- Forget your wrap. Get up.
- But I...

43:32.193 --> 43:33.194
Elsa: Mr. Leibrandt?

43:33.277 --> 43:34.463
- We're leaving.
- Is something wrong?

43:34.487 --> 43:35.530
We're leaving.

43:36.072 --> 43:37.740
There is no boat to leave on.

43:37.824 --> 43:38.991
Then I'll call a helicopter.

43:39.075 --> 43:41.369
That would be very difficult
without phone service.

43:42.245 --> 43:43.246
Fucking move.

43:43.329 --> 43:45.089
Jesus. Just do what they say,
for god's sake!

43:45.122 --> 43:46.749
I'll handle this.

43:46.833 --> 43:49.502
- Just let me handle this.
- With which hand, Mr. Leibrandt?

43:49.585 --> 43:50.628
What?

43:50.711 --> 43:53.548
With which hand will you
handle this? Left or right?

43:53.631 --> 43:55.299
What the fuck are you saying?

43:55.383 --> 43:56.384
Shall we choose?

43:56.968 --> 43:58.052
Richard: Choose what?

43:59.011 --> 44:00.721
Very well. Left hand.

44:01.180 --> 44:02.181
Ring finger.

44:03.850 --> 44:05.434
Let me out! Let me out!

44:05.518 --> 44:06.561
No!

44:06.644 --> 44:07.913
- (Richard whimpers)
- George: Come on. Come on.

44:07.937 --> 44:10.017
- Leave the guy alone.
- What the fuck are you doing?

44:10.106 --> 44:12.024
Soren: Come on. Easy. Easy!
Leave him alone!

44:12.108 --> 44:13.377
George: Leave the old guy alone!

44:13.401 --> 44:15.695
Mr. Leibrandt, please hold still.

44:15.778 --> 44:16.946
- (Cleaver thuds)
- (Screams)

44:17.029 --> 44:18.149
- (Guests scream)
- (Screams)

44:18.197 --> 44:19.532
(Guests gasp)

44:20.825 --> 44:22.410
What the fuck are you doing?

44:24.579 --> 44:26.873
- Anne: Richard!
- (Richard crying in pain)

44:26.956 --> 44:27.999
Richard!

44:30.001 --> 44:31.085
Please stay seated.

44:31.168 --> 44:33.880
(Richard continues crying)

44:33.963 --> 44:35.339
Please stay seated.

44:38.509 --> 44:39.844
Felicity: What the...

44:40.303 --> 44:42.447
George: What the hell's goin' on?
Get a doctor for him.

44:42.471 --> 44:44.181
Do you need assistance finding your seat?

44:44.265 --> 44:45.868
There's a finger. The finger.
There's a finger right there.

44:45.892 --> 44:47.518
The man is screamin' in pain!

44:47.602 --> 44:48.936
Slowik: Please, sit.

44:49.020 --> 44:50.021
Sir?

44:50.605 --> 44:52.690
Soren: It's not funny, lady! Jesus Christ!

44:52.773 --> 44:54.984
- It's all part of the menu.
- (Lillian laughing)

44:56.235 --> 44:57.278
Lillian: Oh, my god!

44:57.361 --> 44:59.447
This is real, isn't it? I can't do it.

45:00.031 --> 45:02.593
- I can't do a hostage thing. I can't.
- Then why don't you go talk to him?

45:02.617 --> 45:04.303
Go talk to him!
Because you know him, right?

45:04.327 --> 45:05.411
I made that up.

45:05.494 --> 45:06.621
Why?

45:07.371 --> 45:10.374
Because I'm a name-dropping whore.
That's why, okay?

45:11.250 --> 45:13.002
(Richard crying in pain)

45:17.256 --> 45:18.966
Elsa: Your husband's ring, madam.

45:22.803 --> 45:24.221
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

45:24.305 --> 45:25.556
Lillian: Ted. Ted!

45:26.140 --> 45:29.936
I honestly think that this whole thing
is just for our benefit.

45:30.019 --> 45:31.354
I mean, us.

45:31.437 --> 45:35.149
That's why he texted me.
And this is incredible. Right?

45:35.858 --> 45:37.318
The acting is astonishing.

45:37.401 --> 45:38.841
What the fuck are you talkin' about?

45:40.029 --> 45:42.490
Chef slowik would like
to see you in the kitchen.

45:44.992 --> 45:46.494
Tyler: Can I come, too?
Elsa: No.

46:04.595 --> 46:07.181
No, no, I'm sorry, but you're all wrong.

46:07.264 --> 46:08.367
- (Chuckles)
- Why are you doing this?

46:08.391 --> 46:09.725
You're just simply wrong.

46:09.809 --> 46:11.102
What are you talking about?

46:11.686 --> 46:12.687
Who are you?

46:13.646 --> 46:14.647
Margot.

46:15.439 --> 46:16.941
My name is Margot.

46:17.024 --> 46:19.777
I've served many margots.
You're not a Margot.

46:19.860 --> 46:22.488
- No.
- What the fuck does it matter?

46:22.571 --> 46:25.324
It matters because this menu,
this guest list,

46:25.408 --> 46:28.327
this entire evening
has been painstakingly planned.

46:28.411 --> 46:30.955
And you were not a part of that plan.

46:31.914 --> 46:33.749
And it's spoiling everything.

46:34.792 --> 46:37.586
In order to proceed,
I have to know where to seat you.

46:38.212 --> 46:40.214
With us, or with them?

46:40.881 --> 46:42.508
It's really... it's very important.

46:43.092 --> 46:45.136
And then you'll let me live?

46:45.511 --> 46:46.512
Let you live? No!

46:47.263 --> 46:48.264
Of course not.

46:49.432 --> 46:51.809
Can't you see that
that would ruin the menu?

46:52.893 --> 46:54.145
We're all gonna die tonight.

46:54.937 --> 46:56.230
Isn't that right?

46:56.313 --> 46:57.314
Cooking team: Yes, chef!

46:57.940 --> 46:59.984
So, the question is,

47:00.067 --> 47:03.487
do you wanna die with those who give,
or with those who take?

47:03.821 --> 47:05.740
But I die either way?

47:06.574 --> 47:07.742
It's arbitrary.

47:07.825 --> 47:10.536
No, it's not arbitrary.
Nothing in this kitchen is arbitrary.

47:12.163 --> 47:13.164
Please pick.

47:14.081 --> 47:16.250
These decisions are important, and, uh,

47:17.209 --> 47:18.961
our menu is strictly timed.

47:20.212 --> 47:21.422
In 15 minutes,

47:22.423 --> 47:27.261
I'll take a break between courses,
and that is how long you have to decide.

47:28.804 --> 47:30.056
It's our side or theirs.

47:30.139 --> 47:31.474
(Timer ticking)

47:31.557 --> 47:33.277
In the meantime,
please return to your seat.

47:33.350 --> 47:35.061
The next dish is exquisite.

47:40.691 --> 47:43.277
- Plating in five!
- Cooking team: Yes, chef!

47:43.360 --> 47:45.946
- I love you all.
- Cooking team: We love you, too, chef!

47:46.030 --> 47:47.281
(Ominous music playing)

47:50.242 --> 47:52.203
Tyler: Fuck!
He offer you a kitchen course?

47:52.286 --> 47:54.121
All right, what was it? Protein or veg?

47:56.624 --> 47:59.043
Protein or veg? Hmm?

48:01.962 --> 48:04.465
God damn it. It's not fucking fair.

48:04.548 --> 48:06.258
Why do you get a kitchen course?

48:07.593 --> 48:09.512
You smoke all day.
Can't even fucking taste it.

48:09.595 --> 48:11.222
(Breath trembling)

48:21.857 --> 48:23.168
Bryce: We're cornered. Let's focus.

48:23.192 --> 48:26.403
Wait, what's the play here?
What are our options?

48:26.487 --> 48:30.241
Dave: The door is guarded,
but it could be a play.

48:31.408 --> 48:32.409
Bryce: Yeah.

48:32.493 --> 48:34.537
Has anybody seen
down the hallway if we can...

48:35.121 --> 48:37.915
Hey, guys. We gotta do something,
and we can't be cowards.

48:37.998 --> 48:39.851
This worked in a movie
I did called <i>the assault.</i>

48:39.875 --> 48:42.437
When they bring their knives and forks,
we just storm their kitchen, okay?

48:42.461 --> 48:44.106
You think we have
better knife skills than them?

48:44.130 --> 48:45.440
George: What other choice do we have?

48:45.464 --> 48:46.733
Dave: I don't fuckin' know, man.

48:46.757 --> 48:47.925
Bryce: So what, then? We...

48:48.008 --> 48:50.219
Fuck it. I'm gonna break
this fucking window.

48:50.302 --> 48:52.346
- George: Yeah! Go for it! Go for it!
- (Yells)

48:52.680 --> 48:54.974
(Muffled yelling)

48:55.975 --> 48:57.768
(Yelling)

49:01.897 --> 49:02.982
Fuck!

49:04.817 --> 49:06.569
Please let me help you back to your table.

49:06.652 --> 49:07.653
Fuck.

49:09.905 --> 49:11.073
I'm sorry, man.

49:12.533 --> 49:13.909
(Claps)

49:13.993 --> 49:15.828
- God.
- Soren: Fuck.

49:15.911 --> 49:17.413
Slowik: There's a saying.

49:17.496 --> 49:19.999
"Sometimes all you need
is a good cup of tea."

49:21.500 --> 49:24.503
I learned that growing up in Bratislava.

49:24.587 --> 49:27.006
I've found that not only
does tea cleanse the palate,

49:27.089 --> 49:31.552
but it offers a soothing balm
when facing some hard home truths.

49:32.428 --> 49:34.388
But before we continue,

49:35.055 --> 49:38.184
are there any questions
about me or hawthorn?

49:38.767 --> 49:40.436
Any questions?

49:40.519 --> 49:41.562
(Coughs)

49:43.230 --> 49:45.024
Is this bergamot I'm getting, chef?

49:45.858 --> 49:47.193
Yes, it is.

49:47.276 --> 49:49.195
- George: (Clears throat) Chef?
- Yes?

49:49.278 --> 49:52.781
Uh, I think I speak for everybody here
when I say that, uh...

49:53.657 --> 49:55.618
I wanna know... I mean, we wanna know...

49:55.701 --> 49:57.411
Why the fuck is this happening, man?

49:57.494 --> 50:00.289
Slowik: Well, I'll tell you.
Think of yourselves as ingredients

50:00.372 --> 50:02.499
in a degustation concept.

50:02.583 --> 50:05.002
- What?
- Slowik: A tasting concept.

50:05.085 --> 50:07.588
Figuratively speaking. (Chuckles)

50:07.671 --> 50:09.391
I think that is the best way
to describe it.

50:10.049 --> 50:13.260
But none of this should be
a surprise to most of you.

50:14.053 --> 50:15.095
Ms. Bloom.

50:15.179 --> 50:19.725
Lillian, if I may,
my cherished early advocate

50:19.808 --> 50:23.312
knows the damage she has done
to so many livelihoods.

50:23.395 --> 50:25.814
No, no, no. (Stutters) Hang on, chef.

50:25.898 --> 50:27.566
Slowik: No, no, no. No, you don't talk.

50:27.650 --> 50:28.817
Ted: I'm sorry, chef.

50:28.901 --> 50:30.778
You submitted to an interview

50:30.861 --> 50:32.696
- with Lillian bloom.
- Slowik: What? What?

50:32.780 --> 50:34.257
And that interview
created this restaurant.

50:34.281 --> 50:36.825
Slowik: You enable her filth.
You enable her filth.

50:36.909 --> 50:38.744
You buttress.

50:38.827 --> 50:40.287
You coddle.

50:41.413 --> 50:42.998
Server: More broken emulsion, madam.

50:43.082 --> 50:46.335
Slowik: You loved that I texted you
an invitation for this evening.

50:46.418 --> 50:49.255
Me yearning for your attendance. (Scoffs)

50:49.338 --> 50:51.966
Your ego was fed.
But that is to be expected.

50:52.049 --> 50:53.968
And no, you've fed my ego as well.

50:55.302 --> 50:56.762
Ten minutes, Ms. Mills.

50:56.845 --> 51:00.224
Please. My... my husband
needs to go to the hospital.

51:00.307 --> 51:02.268
I'm fine. Just let my wife go.

51:02.351 --> 51:04.270
My loyal regulars.

51:04.353 --> 51:07.731
How many times have you eaten here
in the last five years?

51:07.815 --> 51:09.400
I don't know. Six or seven?

51:09.483 --> 51:13.737
- I think it's more than that, dick.
- Eleven. Eleven times.

51:13.821 --> 51:17.616
Most people consider themselves blessed
if they eat here only once.

51:17.700 --> 51:18.867
(Sighs)

51:18.951 --> 51:21.662
Mr. Leibrandt,
kindly name one dish you ate

51:21.745 --> 51:23.664
the last time you were here.

51:27.334 --> 51:28.335
(Clicks tongue)

51:28.419 --> 51:30.963
Eleven times you take the boat out here

51:31.046 --> 51:34.675
where we introduce every dish
every single time.

51:34.758 --> 51:37.011
We tell you exactly
what we're feeding you.

51:37.094 --> 51:40.347
Please tell me one dish you ate
the last time you were here.

51:41.223 --> 51:42.391
Or the time before.

51:43.225 --> 51:44.852
One. Please.

51:47.146 --> 51:49.481
- (Whispers) COD.
- What?

51:50.983 --> 51:52.234
COD.

51:53.068 --> 51:54.069
COD.

51:54.153 --> 51:56.905
It wasn't COD, you donkey.

51:56.989 --> 51:58.532
It was Halibut.

51:58.615 --> 52:01.076
Rare, fucking spotted Halibut.

52:01.869 --> 52:03.162
What does it matter?

52:03.245 --> 52:05.456
It matters to the Halibut, Mrs. Leibrandt.

52:05.539 --> 52:09.251
And to the artist whose work
turns to shit inside your gut.

52:09.335 --> 52:10.586
(Clicks tongue)

52:10.669 --> 52:12.880
I've allowed my work
to reach the price point

52:12.963 --> 52:16.800
where only the class of people
in this room can access it.

52:16.884 --> 52:18.969
And I've been fooled
into trying to satisfy

52:19.053 --> 52:21.722
people who could never be satisfied.

52:21.805 --> 52:24.391
Starting with her.

52:24.808 --> 52:26.727
But that's our culture, isn't it?

52:26.810 --> 52:29.104
And my restaurant is part of the problem.

52:29.688 --> 52:31.190
You say it's your restaurant.

52:31.273 --> 52:34.318
But if we're all just bein'
honest tonight, it's not.

52:35.110 --> 52:38.280
You're right.
Doug verrick is my angel investor.

52:38.364 --> 52:40.699
He owns this island and this restaurant.

52:40.783 --> 52:44.203
And since hawthorn is my entire life,

52:44.286 --> 52:46.872
I would have to say
that Doug verrick owns me.

52:46.955 --> 52:49.208
Except now things are
a little more complicated,

52:49.291 --> 52:51.710
and I own Doug verrick.

52:52.795 --> 52:56.048
- (Laughing)
- (Eerie choral music playing)

52:56.131 --> 52:57.883
(Groaning)

52:59.009 --> 53:01.011
Bryce: Oh, Jesus.
Margot: Oh, my god.

53:01.845 --> 53:03.055
Bryce: Holy shit.

53:03.138 --> 53:04.657
Soren: Hey, hey. How do we stop this, man?

53:04.681 --> 53:06.401
- No.
- Okay? Just please just make it stop.

53:06.475 --> 53:08.787
Just fuckin' tell us how to stop this.
We'll stop it, okay?

53:08.811 --> 53:10.955
- Slowik: You can't stop it.
- Obviously, we have money.

53:10.979 --> 53:12.940
Just say how much,
and we'll give it to you!

53:13.023 --> 53:15.359
Just say a fucking number, man!

53:15.442 --> 53:18.445
Slowik: No. I don't need your money.

53:21.490 --> 53:22.908
(Dave whimpers)

53:22.991 --> 53:24.368
(Groans)

53:25.911 --> 53:28.872
He kept you open through covid, you prick!

53:28.956 --> 53:32.459
Slowik: Yes, he did.
And he questioned my menu.

53:33.335 --> 53:37.798
He would even request substitutions
despite the fact that

53:37.881 --> 53:42.344
there are no substitutions at hawthorn!

53:44.555 --> 53:46.348
Fallen angel, please.

53:51.019 --> 53:53.147
Doug: No! No, no!

53:54.398 --> 53:55.649
Bryce: What the hell?

53:55.732 --> 53:56.942
Soren: No. Slowik: Listen.

53:57.025 --> 53:58.944
- This is fucking...
- I said, "listen."

53:59.027 --> 54:01.655
Doug: No! Julian!

54:01.738 --> 54:03.633
- Soren: This is fuckin' insane.
- I said, "listen."

54:03.657 --> 54:04.658
Felicity: No...

54:06.785 --> 54:08.805
- Slowik: (Shushes) Listen.
- Soren: No, no. This is fuckin' insane.

54:08.829 --> 54:10.038
Slowik: No, I said, "listen!"

54:10.122 --> 54:12.708
- Just listen!
- (Guests gasping)

54:12.791 --> 54:13.834
Yeah.

54:13.917 --> 54:15.544
(Muffled screaming)

54:17.129 --> 54:18.338
Do you hear?

54:19.631 --> 54:20.883
And...

54:22.676 --> 54:23.886
And...

54:26.138 --> 54:28.015
under he goes, and...

54:28.974 --> 54:31.101
- quiet.
- (Timer ticking)

54:31.185 --> 54:32.311
Do you hear it?

54:33.020 --> 54:35.355
Do you hear that silence?
Listen, can you hear it?

54:37.107 --> 54:39.026
That silence means...

54:40.360 --> 54:41.612
I'm free.

54:48.202 --> 54:49.602
- (Timer ringing)
- (Felicity gasps)

54:49.661 --> 54:51.455
Elsa: Time's up, Ms. Mills.

54:51.538 --> 54:54.082
Chef will speak with you now
in his office.

55:00.714 --> 55:01.882
(Knocking at door)

55:03.467 --> 55:04.593
Come in.

55:15.103 --> 55:16.980
You've made your decision?

55:17.064 --> 55:19.233
- I have.
- And what have you decided?

55:20.359 --> 55:22.528
That you were right.

55:24.279 --> 55:25.864
I shouldn't be here.

55:25.948 --> 55:28.283
And I say this with respect,

55:28.367 --> 55:30.911
because I'm sure
that you're quite brilliant,

55:30.994 --> 55:35.374
but, um, all of this is not meant for me.

55:35.457 --> 55:38.669
You're not sure I'm brilliant,
so don't say it. It's false.

55:39.127 --> 55:40.337
Fine.

55:40.629 --> 55:42.339
I'm not sure that you're brilliant.

55:42.422 --> 55:44.049
Oh, I was expecting more.

55:44.132 --> 55:45.634
Fuck you!

55:45.717 --> 55:48.428
I guess I'm gonna have to make
your decision for you.

55:49.680 --> 55:53.308
You belong here with your own breed.

55:54.560 --> 55:56.478
And what breed is that?

55:56.562 --> 55:58.188
With the shit shovelers.

55:59.314 --> 56:00.440
You thought I couldn't tell?

56:00.524 --> 56:04.611
Oh, I know a fellow
service industry worker when I see one.

56:05.737 --> 56:08.365
Mr. Leibrandt. How do you know him?

56:09.950 --> 56:11.660
You've been eyeing him all evening.

56:11.743 --> 56:14.746
- Well, I think you know.
- No, I don't.

56:16.790 --> 56:19.126
So, he paid for an experience.

56:19.209 --> 56:23.005
And I can tell,
as one provider of experiences to another,

56:23.088 --> 56:25.090
that you don't rattle easily.

56:25.173 --> 56:28.135
- So, how did he rattle you?
- (Scoffs)

56:28.218 --> 56:29.636
- He didn't rattle...
- Margot.

56:32.264 --> 56:34.057
He told me to agree
with everything he said

56:34.141 --> 56:35.827
and continue eye contact
while he jerked off.

56:35.851 --> 56:37.394
Wow. Specific.

56:37.477 --> 56:38.645
Not really.

56:39.563 --> 56:41.106
Pretty unoriginal.

56:42.816 --> 56:44.735
What rattled me

56:45.485 --> 56:48.113
is that he told me
to tell him that he was a good man,

56:48.196 --> 56:49.406
and that I was his daughter,

56:49.489 --> 56:51.742
and that he loved me,
and I loved him and...

56:51.825 --> 56:53.285
And so, he's a romantic.

56:54.620 --> 56:56.705
- (Scoffs)
- No, I don't need details.

56:56.788 --> 57:00.042
You know, I...
I know what a bad customer is.

57:02.210 --> 57:03.462
(Ominous music playing)

57:03.545 --> 57:04.588
Yeah.

57:06.923 --> 57:09.384
Do you enjoy providing your services?

57:12.179 --> 57:13.263
Yes.

57:14.181 --> 57:16.266
Or I... I used to.

57:18.060 --> 57:20.437
Do you enjoy providing yours?

57:21.229 --> 57:22.731
Oh, I used to,

57:24.566 --> 57:27.486
but I haven't desired to cook
for someone in ages.

57:29.071 --> 57:31.073
And one does miss that feeling.

57:33.241 --> 57:34.409
Come with me.

57:36.787 --> 57:39.998
Slowik: (Clapping) Everyone's so down!

57:40.082 --> 57:43.335
Ladies and gentlemen, for our next course,

57:43.418 --> 57:46.129
let us take the evening air!

57:46.213 --> 57:47.673
Come on! Outside!

57:47.756 --> 57:49.966
- Sommelier: Please, sir.
- Come on. Outside, everyone.

57:50.050 --> 57:51.778
Soren: If we can find a boat,
we can make a break for it.

57:51.802 --> 57:54.179
Slowik: Regulars, too. Come on.
Elsa: Please follow chef.

57:54.930 --> 57:57.849
Chef, I'd love to talk to you
very quickly, chef.

57:57.933 --> 57:59.535
Slowik: Come on!
Sommelier: After you, please.

57:59.559 --> 58:00.852
Guests first.

58:00.936 --> 58:02.229
(Richard groans)

58:02.312 --> 58:03.563
Anne: Richard.

58:08.276 --> 58:09.361
Slowik: Follow me.

58:10.195 --> 58:12.364
Into the tranquil night air.

58:20.247 --> 58:23.417
Don't be frightened.
Nothing to be frightened of.

58:25.377 --> 58:27.980
So, maybe there's a spare boat somewhere
and we can get out of here.

58:28.004 --> 58:29.256
To what?

58:29.339 --> 58:30.882
- What?
- Get out of here to what?

58:30.966 --> 58:32.443
What the fuck are you talking about, bro?

58:32.467 --> 58:33.593
- We're dead.
- It's okay.

58:33.677 --> 58:34.779
No. We're gonna die tonight.

58:34.803 --> 58:35.971
- Yes, we are. Yeah.
- Yeah.

58:36.054 --> 58:40.350
Slowik: Our next course will be presented
by sous-chef, Katherine Keller.

58:45.647 --> 58:47.065
Good evening, everyone.

58:49.317 --> 58:50.527
Three years ago,

58:51.361 --> 58:52.946
Julian slowik tried to fuck me.

58:54.406 --> 58:55.991
I refused his advances.

58:56.450 --> 58:58.326
A week later, he tried again.

58:58.410 --> 59:00.579
And again, I refused.

59:02.164 --> 59:03.457
But he didn't fire me.

59:03.832 --> 59:05.041
No.

59:05.125 --> 59:07.169
He kept me in his kitchen,

59:07.252 --> 59:12.924
and refused to look me in the eye
or speak directly to me for eight months.

59:14.384 --> 59:15.635
He can do that.

59:16.845 --> 59:18.054
Because he's the star.

59:19.347 --> 59:20.932
He's the man.

59:22.184 --> 59:25.479
Our next course is called "man's folly."

59:34.821 --> 59:36.656
- (Squelching)
- (Guests gasp)

59:36.740 --> 59:39.117
- (Slowik groans)
- (Guests groan)

59:44.498 --> 59:46.875
(Dramatic music playing)

59:52.130 --> 59:53.340
I'm sorry.

59:57.552 --> 59:59.429
- (Slowik groans)
- (Guests groan)

01:00:00.096 --> 01:00:01.264
Soren: Fuck.

01:00:01.973 --> 01:00:05.936
To our male diners,
we now offer you the chance to escape.

01:00:06.436 --> 01:00:09.231
You'll be given a 45-second head start,

01:00:09.523 --> 01:00:12.901
at which point members of my staff
will try and catch you.

01:00:12.984 --> 01:00:14.402
If they do catch...

01:00:14.486 --> 01:00:15.904
- (Soren grunting)
- Okay.

01:00:17.405 --> 01:00:19.616
Forty-five seconds starts now.

01:00:19.699 --> 01:00:21.284
(Timer ticking)

01:00:22.035 --> 01:00:23.286
- Hold this.
- What?

01:00:23.370 --> 01:00:25.372
I'm sorry. Come on. You know I'm awful.

01:00:25.455 --> 01:00:27.082
Ted: You're a wonderful critic. (Kisses)

01:00:28.208 --> 01:00:30.252
I'll... I'll send for help. First thing.

01:00:35.799 --> 01:00:37.050
(Chuckles softly)

01:00:40.220 --> 01:00:41.471
You, too.

01:00:47.936 --> 01:00:50.438
I'll, uh, leave you to it.

01:00:55.861 --> 01:00:57.221
Katherine: Care to join me inside?

01:00:57.612 --> 01:00:58.947
It's getting chilly.

01:01:00.991 --> 01:01:02.158
It's right this way.

01:01:04.953 --> 01:01:05.996
Lillian: Okay.

01:01:06.580 --> 01:01:07.622
This way.

01:01:13.795 --> 01:01:15.422
(Door closes)

01:01:22.596 --> 01:01:24.347
- (Timer ringing)
- Go!

01:01:33.565 --> 01:01:35.567
Felicity: Thank you.
Anne: Thank you.

01:01:41.406 --> 01:01:44.284
(Tense music playing)

01:01:47.078 --> 01:01:48.788
- (Wistful music playing)
- Mmm.

01:01:49.289 --> 01:01:50.832
Lillian: This is fantastic.

01:01:50.916 --> 01:01:55.420
The tartness of the umeboshi
and the waves of ferment.

01:01:55.503 --> 01:01:57.631
It's rich, and yet it's clean.

01:01:57.714 --> 01:01:59.007
It's delicious.

01:01:59.925 --> 01:02:02.260
Yes, well, there was a time

01:02:02.344 --> 01:02:04.304
that would have meant
a lot to me, Ms. Bloom.

01:02:07.891 --> 01:02:09.309
(Sniffles)

01:02:12.020 --> 01:02:14.230
(Sobbing)

01:02:14.314 --> 01:02:15.899
Margot: Mmm.

01:02:15.982 --> 01:02:17.025
Felicity: It's so good.

01:02:17.108 --> 01:02:18.836
Anne: Yes, it's really good.
Margot: Mmm-hmm.

01:02:18.860 --> 01:02:21.404
You know, it's the emoji for me.

01:02:21.488 --> 01:02:23.031
- Umeboshi.
- Felicity: Hmm?

01:02:23.114 --> 01:02:24.449
- Umeboshi.
- Felicity: Umeboshi.

01:02:24.532 --> 01:02:25.784
Lillian: This is so good.

01:02:26.409 --> 01:02:28.220
Felicity: You're very talented.
Katherine: Thank you.

01:02:28.244 --> 01:02:31.039
Usually don't like foam, but...

01:02:32.165 --> 01:02:34.125
Soren: Don't fucking run next to me, bro!

01:02:34.209 --> 01:02:35.436
Bryce: No, you're running next to me!

01:02:35.460 --> 01:02:37.140
Soren: It's a big fuckin' forest!
Fuck off!

01:02:37.170 --> 01:02:38.970
Bryce: Get away from me!
Soren: Fuck off, bro!

01:02:40.924 --> 01:02:41.967
(Tense music playing)

01:02:42.050 --> 01:02:43.051
Fuck.

01:02:43.677 --> 01:02:44.719
Soren: Oh, my god.

01:02:46.012 --> 01:02:47.138
Yeah.

01:02:50.767 --> 01:02:51.810
Anne: So...

01:02:54.145 --> 01:02:55.563
You know my husband.

01:02:56.106 --> 01:02:58.817
(Screaming)

01:03:02.153 --> 01:03:03.405
(Coughs) Um...

01:03:05.573 --> 01:03:06.574
Yeah.

01:03:07.242 --> 01:03:08.243
I do.

01:03:09.703 --> 01:03:10.787
Right.

01:03:17.168 --> 01:03:18.503
Felicity: You can tell us.

01:03:19.254 --> 01:03:20.839
Are we all really dying tonight?

01:03:22.841 --> 01:03:25.218
It doesn't work if you live.

01:03:26.052 --> 01:03:27.929
- Anne: What doesn't work?
- The menu.

01:03:28.013 --> 01:03:29.014
Felicity: Why not?

01:03:29.597 --> 01:03:31.016
It needs an ending...

01:03:33.351 --> 01:03:35.031
That ties everything together
conceptually.

01:03:36.021 --> 01:03:37.821
Otherwise, it just tastes good,
and who cares.

01:03:37.897 --> 01:03:40.097
Lillian: I mean, really,
you should have your own place.

01:03:40.150 --> 01:03:41.818
Right? And I could help you with that.

01:03:42.318 --> 01:03:44.718
- I'm sure you could, Ms. Bloom.
- Lillian: I could. I could.

01:03:44.779 --> 01:03:47.365
We would just have
to talk about... (Stutters)

01:03:48.658 --> 01:03:50.410
(Chuckles nervously) ...The dying thing.

01:03:50.493 --> 01:03:53.663
Oh, everyone dying was my pitch, actually.

01:03:54.831 --> 01:03:56.082
I'm super proud of it.

01:04:00.420 --> 01:04:01.856
- Anybody want any wine?
- Yes, please.

01:04:01.880 --> 01:04:02.964
Lillian: Fuck it.

01:04:03.048 --> 01:04:05.675
- Anne: Thank you.
- (Wine pouring)

01:04:05.759 --> 01:04:06.885
(Groaning loudly)

01:04:09.012 --> 01:04:11.431
I heard a pop. (Yelps)

01:04:15.185 --> 01:04:16.227
Fuck!

01:04:17.228 --> 01:04:18.229
Fuck!

01:04:25.403 --> 01:04:27.030
(Chicken clucking)

01:04:32.452 --> 01:04:33.661
(Gasps)

01:04:33.745 --> 01:04:35.765
Server: A special bite
for the last guest to be caught.

01:04:35.789 --> 01:04:39.209
A little play on the passard egg
with crème fraîche and maple.

01:04:44.089 --> 01:04:45.548
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

01:04:47.926 --> 01:04:51.304
Not that you guys
give a single, flying fuck,

01:04:51.387 --> 01:04:53.556
but my name is not Margot.

01:04:54.224 --> 01:04:55.433
It's Erin.

01:04:55.517 --> 01:04:58.103
And I'm from brockton, Massachusetts...

01:05:00.605 --> 01:05:01.648
So there's that.

01:05:03.525 --> 01:05:05.401
(Door opens)

01:05:06.736 --> 01:05:08.029
Party's over.

01:05:11.991 --> 01:05:13.071
Sommelier: Come, gentlemen.

01:05:13.576 --> 01:05:15.328
- Welcome back.
- What did you get?

01:05:15.411 --> 01:05:16.412
Sommelier: Sir? Please.

01:05:16.496 --> 01:05:18.623
Excuse me. I'm sorry.
I'll take that. Thank you.

01:05:18.706 --> 01:05:20.166
Ms. Bloom. Please.

01:05:21.084 --> 01:05:23.253
Allow me. No, it's fine. It's fine.

01:05:27.173 --> 01:05:28.174
Here.

01:05:29.092 --> 01:05:30.176
Oh, god.

01:05:30.260 --> 01:05:31.845
(Door closes)

01:05:35.223 --> 01:05:36.543
Felicity: How'd you do out there?

01:05:37.016 --> 01:05:39.477
I did great. I killed it.

01:05:40.019 --> 01:05:41.479
I'm the only one who got away.

01:05:42.522 --> 01:05:44.732
I'm sorry. I'm a fuckin' failure.

01:05:45.066 --> 01:05:46.109
It's okay.

01:05:48.653 --> 01:05:50.363
I've been stealing money from you.

01:05:51.614 --> 01:05:52.615
George: I know.

01:05:53.658 --> 01:05:54.826
I know you know.

01:05:55.451 --> 01:05:57.954
I wrote a negative recommendation to Sony.

01:05:59.164 --> 01:06:00.874
I know. You cc'd me on it.

01:06:02.584 --> 01:06:03.585
Slowik: Folks,

01:06:04.252 --> 01:06:07.755
I'm afraid our menu
cannot continue as planned

01:06:07.839 --> 01:06:10.383
until we deal with an unresolved matter.

01:06:11.426 --> 01:06:12.594
You.

01:06:14.596 --> 01:06:15.638
Me?

01:06:16.306 --> 01:06:17.765
Slowik: Mmm-hmm.

01:06:17.849 --> 01:06:18.892
You.

01:06:21.436 --> 01:06:23.188
Tell me why you're here.

01:06:25.398 --> 01:06:27.567
(Grunts) You know, because I wanted to...

01:06:27.650 --> 01:06:28.651
Swallow first.

01:06:28.735 --> 01:06:30.028
(Tyler grunting, gulps)

01:06:31.779 --> 01:06:33.489
I wanted to experience your food, chef.

01:06:33.573 --> 01:06:34.782
And what were you told?

01:06:36.492 --> 01:06:38.620
- (Tyler stutters)
- What were you told ahead of time?

01:06:41.915 --> 01:06:44.709
You told me it'd be
the greatest menu ever created.

01:06:44.792 --> 01:06:46.544
Right. And? And?

01:06:48.421 --> 01:06:53.760
And that everyone would die.

01:06:53.843 --> 01:06:55.094
Slowik: "Everyone would die."

01:06:55.178 --> 01:06:57.430
- (Guests gasp)
- Slowik: You had a date.

01:06:58.097 --> 01:07:00.141
I seem to remember you had a date.

01:07:00.225 --> 01:07:02.435
Not the young woman here tonight,

01:07:03.228 --> 01:07:05.647
so what happened to her? Your date?

01:07:07.232 --> 01:07:09.317
She broke up with me, chef.

01:07:09.400 --> 01:07:10.985
So, you brought Margot.

01:07:11.069 --> 01:07:12.528
Tyler: Mmm-hmm. Slowik: Mmm-hmm.

01:07:12.612 --> 01:07:13.655
Why?

01:07:15.156 --> 01:07:17.742
'Cause you don't offer seatings for one.

01:07:17.825 --> 01:07:20.620
So, you hired her knowing she'd die.

01:07:20.703 --> 01:07:23.915
- (Tense music playing)
- (Breath trembling)

01:07:23.998 --> 01:07:26.417
- Tyler: Yes.
- You entitled piece of shit!

01:07:26.501 --> 01:07:29.128
- (Groans)
- I'm gonna kill you, Tyler!

01:07:29.212 --> 01:07:30.713
(Margot growls)

01:07:31.256 --> 01:07:32.590
Tyler: Calm down.

01:07:32.674 --> 01:07:34.717
(Panting)

01:07:37.595 --> 01:07:39.305
Slowik: You can't blame her, can you?

01:07:40.181 --> 01:07:42.034
For the eight months
I've corresponded with you,

01:07:42.058 --> 01:07:46.271
I gave you, Tyler,
access to our world, hmm.

01:07:46.354 --> 01:07:48.731
And I swore you to secrecy.

01:07:49.607 --> 01:07:51.067
Why do you think I'd do this?

01:07:51.651 --> 01:07:53.736
- You wanted me here because...
- Why? Why?

01:07:53.820 --> 01:07:55.780
You said I know a lot about food.

01:07:55.863 --> 01:07:58.092
Slowik: That's right.
You're not like the others, are you?

01:07:58.116 --> 01:08:00.118
I mean, you know what a pacojet is.

01:08:00.201 --> 01:08:02.412
- Yeah.
- Slowik: You knew what the bergamot was.

01:08:02.495 --> 01:08:04.664
- Yeah. I could taste it.
- Yeah, you could.

01:08:04.747 --> 01:08:06.332
Yeah, I know, but you identified it.

01:08:06.416 --> 01:08:08.251
- Picked it out.
- Mmm-hmm. Right.

01:08:08.334 --> 01:08:09.669
That impressed me.

01:08:09.752 --> 01:08:11.170
- Really?
- Yeah, yeah.

01:08:11.254 --> 01:08:12.672
- I mean, you're a cook.
- Oh!

01:08:12.755 --> 01:08:14.424
Cooks belong in the kitchen.

01:08:15.091 --> 01:08:16.426
Right?

01:08:16.509 --> 01:08:18.136
Cooking team: Yes, chef!

01:08:18.219 --> 01:08:19.220
Slowik: Yeah.

01:08:19.845 --> 01:08:21.305
- Come with me.
- Tyler: Really?

01:08:21.389 --> 01:08:22.807
Me? Really?

01:08:22.890 --> 01:08:24.890
Slowik: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I have something for you.

01:08:25.184 --> 01:08:26.769
Tyler: (Chuckles) Okay.

01:08:26.853 --> 01:08:28.520
Come here. Elsa has it.

01:08:28.604 --> 01:08:30.773
Ah, it's a chef's jacket.

01:08:33.067 --> 01:08:34.402
(Slowik and Tyler chuckle)

01:08:34.484 --> 01:08:35.653
Courtesy of hawthorn.

01:08:35.737 --> 01:08:36.988
Tyler: Wow. Slowik: Mmm-hmm.

01:08:39.323 --> 01:08:40.408
Ah!

01:08:40.491 --> 01:08:42.201
- Nice.
- Thank you.

01:08:42.285 --> 01:08:44.871
You look wonderful.
Doesn't he look wonderful, Margot?

01:08:44.953 --> 01:08:47.206
- Doesn't he look good?
- Cooking team: Yes, chef!

01:08:47.290 --> 01:08:49.207
Mr. Handsome boy.

01:08:53.004 --> 01:08:54.630
I'm gonna personalize the jacket.

01:08:55.756 --> 01:08:57.716
"T, y,

01:08:58.259 --> 01:09:00.219
"l, e,

01:09:01.511 --> 01:09:02.513
"r."

01:09:04.557 --> 01:09:06.975
Thank you. Thank you.

01:09:07.060 --> 01:09:09.270
- I'm proud of you.
- Thank you, chef.

01:09:09.354 --> 01:09:11.898
Tyler, now cook.

01:09:13.024 --> 01:09:15.109
- What?
- Cook.

01:09:15.693 --> 01:09:18.529
- You're a cook. So, cook.
- Oh, I don't know if I can cook here.

01:09:18.613 --> 01:09:20.907
- Cook. Cook.
- Now? I don't...

01:09:20.990 --> 01:09:22.867
Cook! Go on, now.

01:09:23.326 --> 01:09:24.327
What do you need?

01:09:24.410 --> 01:09:26.095
- We have everything.
- Elsa: Please rise to observe

01:09:26.120 --> 01:09:27.264
- the demonstration.
- Don't be frightened.

01:09:27.287 --> 01:09:30.087
- What do you want... um...
- Please rise to observe the demonstration.

01:09:30.166 --> 01:09:31.352
Slowik: Everyone, please come around.

01:09:31.376 --> 01:09:34.921
Please. Tyler's gonna demonstrate
his culinary expertise.

01:09:35.004 --> 01:09:36.644
Please rise to observe the demonstration.

01:09:36.671 --> 01:09:38.317
Slowik: Everyone, please.
Come around. Come closer.

01:09:38.341 --> 01:09:39.466
What do you need?

01:09:41.094 --> 01:09:43.136
- Uh... leeks.
- Get the cook some leeks.

01:09:43.220 --> 01:09:46.057
Leeks. This is your station here.
What else?

01:09:46.140 --> 01:09:49.060
Um... sh... ah...

01:09:49.143 --> 01:09:51.479
Oh... shit? Would you like some shit?

01:09:51.562 --> 01:09:52.563
No. Uh...

01:09:52.647 --> 01:09:54.189
(Stutters) Shallots.

01:09:54.273 --> 01:09:56.025
Shallots for the great foodie!

01:09:56.109 --> 01:09:57.389
The phenomenal Mr. Food himself!

01:09:57.443 --> 01:09:58.545
Tyler: Excuse me, I'm sorry.

01:09:58.569 --> 01:10:01.072
Everyone gather around.
We must learn from Tyler.

01:10:01.989 --> 01:10:07.286
This is a new dicing method
of which we have been woefully ignorant.

01:10:07.370 --> 01:10:08.413
What next?

01:10:09.288 --> 01:10:10.415
Uh... butter.

01:10:10.498 --> 01:10:13.167
Butter? Butter.
Leeks and shallots sautéed in butter.

01:10:13.251 --> 01:10:16.045
I bear witness to a revolution in cuisine.

01:10:16.129 --> 01:10:18.005
Would you like a protein?

01:10:18.089 --> 01:10:20.258
- Uh... lamb.
- Lamb!

01:10:20.341 --> 01:10:22.260
(Classical music playing)

01:10:29.308 --> 01:10:30.643
Tyler: (Groans) Oh!

01:10:33.396 --> 01:10:35.022
(Tyler muttering)

01:10:37.316 --> 01:10:39.152
(Inhales deeply, exhales sharply)

01:10:39.235 --> 01:10:40.778
- (Pans clatter)
- Oh!

01:10:40.862 --> 01:10:42.572
(Pan sizzling)

01:10:51.164 --> 01:10:52.433
Oh, yeah. I think it's done, chef.

01:10:52.457 --> 01:10:53.559
You think it's done? You're sure?

01:10:53.583 --> 01:10:54.625
- Mmm-hmm.
- You wanna...

01:10:54.709 --> 01:10:56.309
Maybe you wanna jam it into the pacojet.

01:10:56.794 --> 01:10:57.879
No.

01:11:05.303 --> 01:11:06.345
Mmm.

01:11:07.805 --> 01:11:08.973
Wow.

01:11:10.391 --> 01:11:11.434
Wow.

01:11:12.018 --> 01:11:13.311
It's actually quite...

01:11:14.312 --> 01:11:15.313
bad.

01:11:16.647 --> 01:11:18.441
(Bell dings)

01:11:29.911 --> 01:11:34.916
You are why the mystery
has been drained from our art.

01:11:36.459 --> 01:11:38.503
You see that now, don't you?

01:11:40.046 --> 01:11:41.214
Sorry, chef.

01:11:42.048 --> 01:11:44.300
Come here, son. Come.

01:11:46.177 --> 01:11:47.261
Come here.

01:11:51.390 --> 01:11:53.226
(Indistinct whispering)

01:12:10.159 --> 01:12:11.160
Yes, chef.

01:12:25.258 --> 01:12:27.176
And now you're free, too.

01:12:31.472 --> 01:12:34.517
Um, ladies and gentlemen,
I wanna apologize to you all.

01:12:34.600 --> 01:12:38.062
What you just saw was not originally
part of tonight's menu.

01:12:38.145 --> 01:12:40.022
We strive for perfection,

01:12:40.898 --> 01:12:42.316
which of course does not exist,

01:12:42.400 --> 01:12:46.529
and that is a hard truth for me to accept,
so please forgive me.

01:12:47.738 --> 01:12:48.906
Come with me.

01:12:55.496 --> 01:12:57.224
Sommelier:
And that concludes our demonstration.

01:12:57.248 --> 01:12:58.583
Please return to your seats.

01:12:59.083 --> 01:13:00.126
Slowik: Listen to me.

01:13:01.460 --> 01:13:04.213
There's only one more
savory course left in our menu.

01:13:04.297 --> 01:13:06.007
That means we must prepare for dessert.

01:13:06.090 --> 01:13:08.718
- (Sighs)
- Dessert requires a large barrel

01:13:08.801 --> 01:13:10.481
that is supposed to be
there in the corner.

01:13:11.095 --> 01:13:12.722
(Chuckles softly) Do you see a barrel?

01:13:13.889 --> 01:13:16.058
Margot: No. No, I do not.
Slowik: Neither do I.

01:13:16.142 --> 01:13:18.603
That is because
my negligent colleague, Elsa,

01:13:18.686 --> 01:13:20.521
forgot to assign someone to bring it.

01:13:21.939 --> 01:13:25.818
So, Margot,
you will fetch the barrel instead.

01:13:25.901 --> 01:13:27.028
- Me?
- Slowik: Yes.

01:13:27.111 --> 01:13:29.030
You remember the smokehouse? Hmm?

01:13:29.113 --> 01:13:30.656
Margot: (Stutters) Maybe... I don't...

01:13:30.740 --> 01:13:32.283
Chef, perhaps one of us should...

01:13:32.366 --> 01:13:35.077
Slowik: Margot is now one of us, Elsa.

01:13:35.161 --> 01:13:36.245
Right, Margot?

01:13:37.330 --> 01:13:38.497
- Margot: Yes.
- Yes, what?

01:13:39.790 --> 01:13:41.417
Yes, chef.

01:13:41.500 --> 01:13:43.628
Elsa, give her the smokehouse key.

01:13:45.588 --> 01:13:47.715
Yes, chef.

01:13:47.798 --> 01:13:49.091
(Keys jingling)

01:13:53.054 --> 01:13:54.055
Slowik: Go.

01:13:54.555 --> 01:13:55.640
Go!

01:13:55.723 --> 01:13:56.807
Um...

01:14:00.519 --> 01:14:02.229
(Sinister music playing)

01:14:04.398 --> 01:14:06.233
(Dramatic music playing)

01:14:09.779 --> 01:14:11.072
(Bird squawks)

01:14:24.919 --> 01:14:26.671
(Richard breathing heavily)

01:14:28.881 --> 01:14:31.425
(Dramatic music intensifies)

01:14:35.930 --> 01:14:37.306
Excuse me. Uh...

01:14:37.390 --> 01:14:38.516
(Dramatic music fades)

01:14:38.599 --> 01:14:40.434
(Stutters) I'm sorry, chef.

01:14:41.477 --> 01:14:43.312
Sir... sir slowik. Um...

01:14:44.522 --> 01:14:45.940
Hi.

01:14:46.023 --> 01:14:47.024
What's up?

01:14:48.609 --> 01:14:50.069
Oh... well, look...

01:14:50.861 --> 01:14:54.156
What I really...
I just wanted to say because, um...

01:14:54.657 --> 01:14:57.094
Look, I'm not trying to sound,
like, all whatever here or anything,

01:14:57.118 --> 01:15:00.496
but I just don't think it's really fair.

01:15:00.579 --> 01:15:01.706
Maybe.

01:15:01.789 --> 01:15:02.957
(Stutters) If...

01:15:03.040 --> 01:15:05.459
Do you wanna know
why you're being punished?

01:15:07.128 --> 01:15:08.212
(Hesitates)

01:15:09.171 --> 01:15:10.464
Sure.

01:15:10.548 --> 01:15:15.177
I saw the film <i>calling doctor sunshine,
</i> and I did not enjoy it.

01:15:15.845 --> 01:15:16.846
Wait, sorry?

01:15:16.929 --> 01:15:18.180
It was a Sunday.

01:15:19.014 --> 01:15:20.599
My one day off in months.

01:15:21.392 --> 01:15:22.518
The most precious day.

01:15:22.601 --> 01:15:24.353
The day where I was allowed to live.

01:15:24.437 --> 01:15:28.441
And I saw the film <i>calling doctor sunshine
</i> alone in the cinema.

01:15:28.524 --> 01:15:31.694
But look, I didn't direct it.
I just acted in it.

01:15:31.777 --> 01:15:34.321
The memory of your face in that film,

01:15:35.823 --> 01:15:38.743
and seeing you again now haunts me.

01:15:38.826 --> 01:15:39.869
Drives me.

01:15:40.411 --> 01:15:44.248
What happens to an artist
when he loses his purpose?

01:15:44.874 --> 01:15:46.208
It's pitiful.

01:15:47.209 --> 01:15:48.419
No, you're right.

01:15:52.423 --> 01:15:53.716
And what about her?

01:15:54.550 --> 01:15:55.968
What school did you go to?

01:15:56.719 --> 01:15:57.845
Brown.

01:15:57.928 --> 01:15:59.096
Student loans?

01:15:59.972 --> 01:16:01.098
No.

01:16:01.182 --> 01:16:02.725
I'm sorry. You're dying.

01:16:06.061 --> 01:16:07.980
- (Switch clicks)
- (Ominous music playing)

01:16:19.366 --> 01:16:21.577
(Suspenseful music playing)

01:16:52.358 --> 01:16:54.401
- (Switch clicks)
- (Suspenseful music stops)

01:17:06.163 --> 01:17:08.123
Motherfucker.

01:17:10.084 --> 01:17:11.085
Really?

01:17:25.474 --> 01:17:26.976
(Doorknob rattling)

01:17:29.103 --> 01:17:31.647
Elsa: No one is allowed
inside chef's house.

01:17:31.730 --> 01:17:33.399
Do you think you're special?

01:17:36.527 --> 01:17:38.487
You've disobeyed this rule.

01:17:44.159 --> 01:17:47.830
I take care of the customers
so that chef can take care of the menu.

01:17:52.835 --> 01:17:55.170
You've been a nuisance
since you have arrived.

01:17:55.254 --> 01:17:56.463
I'm sorry.

01:17:57.965 --> 01:17:59.675
If you don't mind me asking though,

01:18:00.843 --> 01:18:02.261
why would you die for him?

01:18:02.928 --> 01:18:04.638
You will not replace me.

01:18:04.972 --> 01:18:08.601
Replace you?
Trust me, I have no... (Screams)

01:18:11.020 --> 01:18:13.105
- (Tense music playing)
- (Margot screaming)

01:18:16.692 --> 01:18:18.527
No, no. No!

01:18:18.986 --> 01:18:21.322
(Both grunting)

01:18:29.538 --> 01:18:31.498
(Both scream)

01:18:32.458 --> 01:18:35.252
(Both grunting and struggling)

01:18:41.967 --> 01:18:44.386
Margot: Stop! Enough!

01:18:45.095 --> 01:18:47.932
He didn't tell me about the barrel.

01:18:48.015 --> 01:18:49.850
- I didn't forget.
- (Music intensifies)

01:18:49.934 --> 01:18:51.685
- (Margot screams)
- (Squelching)

01:18:51.769 --> 01:18:53.520
Oh, my god!

01:18:53.604 --> 01:18:54.980
(Blood gushing)

01:18:55.064 --> 01:18:56.649
(Choking)

01:19:03.489 --> 01:19:04.865
(Margot groans)

01:19:10.829 --> 01:19:12.039
(Panting)

01:19:17.378 --> 01:19:19.505
(Tense music fades)

01:19:25.260 --> 01:19:28.555
(Suspenseful music playing)

01:19:35.729 --> 01:19:36.730
(Lock clicks)

01:19:42.987 --> 01:19:44.154
(Switch clicks)

01:20:42.629 --> 01:20:43.672
Oh, my god.

01:20:43.756 --> 01:20:45.174
(Gasps) Um...

01:20:47.301 --> 01:20:49.678
(Radio turns on)

01:20:51.972 --> 01:20:52.973
Hello?

01:20:53.057 --> 01:20:58.854
All: (Singing)
<i>Happy birthday, dear Bryce</i>

01:20:58.937 --> 01:21:04.568
<i>happy birthday to you</i>

01:21:04.651 --> 01:21:06.278
you told them it was my birthday?

01:21:06.361 --> 01:21:08.697
Seemed funny about three hours ago.

01:21:08.781 --> 01:21:09.948
Thank you.

01:21:17.289 --> 01:21:20.876
Well, leave it there and take your seat.

01:21:22.586 --> 01:21:24.505
(Panting)

01:21:26.131 --> 01:21:29.384
I want you to
understand something, Margot.

01:21:35.933 --> 01:21:37.392
I am a monster.

01:21:38.018 --> 01:21:40.229
No, was a monster.

01:21:40.687 --> 01:21:42.064
And a whore.

01:21:43.065 --> 01:21:46.276
But tonight, everything I'm doing is pure.

01:21:46.360 --> 01:21:47.444
Egoless.

01:21:47.528 --> 01:21:51.115
And at last, the pain is almost gone.

01:21:51.949 --> 01:21:53.450
Chef's hands.

01:21:54.535 --> 01:21:56.829
Asbestos hands.

01:21:56.912 --> 01:22:02.126
I can carry a cast-iron from a hot oven
to your table with no protection.

01:22:04.670 --> 01:22:06.421
I can no longer be hurt, Margot.

01:22:07.589 --> 01:22:11.135
As Dr. King said,
"we know through painful experience

01:22:11.218 --> 01:22:14.805
"that freedom is never
voluntarily given by the oppressor.

01:22:14.888 --> 01:22:18.183
"It must be demanded by the oppressed."

01:22:18.267 --> 01:22:19.935
Did he just quote Martin Luther King?

01:22:20.018 --> 01:22:21.103
- Yep.
- Yes, he did.

01:22:22.104 --> 01:22:24.314
(Ship horn blares)

01:22:25.065 --> 01:22:26.066
What?

01:22:29.528 --> 01:22:31.530
I see you found our radio.

01:22:31.613 --> 01:22:33.740
Clear the dining room immediately!

01:22:33.824 --> 01:22:34.992
It's a boat!

01:22:36.660 --> 01:22:37.953
Did you call someone?

01:22:38.036 --> 01:22:39.121
(Sighs in relief)

01:22:39.204 --> 01:22:41.165
- It's a boat.
- It's a boat.

01:22:44.710 --> 01:22:46.545
What? What are you doing? (Groans)

01:22:47.588 --> 01:22:49.508
- (Richard groaning)
- George: Easy! Easy, there!

01:22:49.590 --> 01:22:51.025
Bryce: The fuck are you doing to that man?

01:22:51.049 --> 01:22:52.426
George: Bro, easy with that!

01:22:54.511 --> 01:22:56.054
Slowik: Tight, tight, tight.

01:22:56.138 --> 01:22:57.264
Good.

01:23:00.767 --> 01:23:02.895
You'll be tempted to ask him for help.

01:23:02.978 --> 01:23:04.730
- To plead, even.
- No, no, no.

01:23:04.813 --> 01:23:07.107
This would be unwise. He cannot help you.

01:23:07.191 --> 01:23:08.400
Ask yourselves two things.

01:23:08.483 --> 01:23:12.571
One, if you really wanna be responsible
for the death of an innocent man.

01:23:12.654 --> 01:23:15.949
And two, ask yourselves,
this entire evening,

01:23:16.033 --> 01:23:18.827
why didn't you all try harder
to fight back?

01:23:18.911 --> 01:23:20.537
To get out of here?

01:23:21.288 --> 01:23:23.123
Honestly, you probably could have.

01:23:24.124 --> 01:23:25.959
Something to think about.

01:23:35.052 --> 01:23:37.387
Slowik: Good evening, officer.
How can we help you?

01:23:37.971 --> 01:23:39.514
I got a report of a disturbance.

01:23:40.349 --> 01:23:42.267
Uh, here? (Scoffs)

01:23:42.351 --> 01:23:43.644
What kind of a disturbance?

01:23:45.312 --> 01:23:46.438
Officer: A violent one.

01:23:47.981 --> 01:23:49.821
- Are you the owner?
- I am the executive chef.

01:23:49.900 --> 01:23:53.153
Ownership changed hands recently,
but that's another story.

01:23:53.237 --> 01:23:55.280
Now, I don't wish to be rude,
but as you can see,

01:23:55.364 --> 01:23:57.032
we're right in the middle of service.

01:24:01.370 --> 01:24:04.581
Did anybody here call in a distress
over the shortwave tonight?

01:24:07.376 --> 01:24:08.835
(Slowik laughing softly)

01:24:08.919 --> 01:24:11.380
We're not in the habit
of serving our guests

01:24:11.463 --> 01:24:14.007
shortwave radios with their meals.

01:24:14.091 --> 01:24:15.509
(Cooking team laugh)

01:24:25.269 --> 01:24:26.603
Hey.

01:24:26.687 --> 01:24:28.355
Uh... are you...

01:24:29.106 --> 01:24:31.525
Yes, yes, yes. I am.

01:24:31.608 --> 01:24:34.152
Wow. I'm a big fan.

01:24:34.778 --> 01:24:35.779
Thank you.

01:24:35.862 --> 01:24:37.197
Would you like his autograph?

01:24:39.825 --> 01:24:40.993
(Hesitates) Uh...

01:24:41.702 --> 01:24:42.782
I don't want to bother you.

01:24:42.828 --> 01:24:45.497
No, no, no. It wouldn't be a bother.

01:24:45.580 --> 01:24:47.541
(Stutters) I just, I don't have a...

01:24:47.624 --> 01:24:49.960
Slowik: No, we have a pen. Let's do it.

01:24:51.253 --> 01:24:52.254
Yeah.

01:24:52.337 --> 01:24:53.630
Thank you.

01:24:55.257 --> 01:24:56.633
- What's your name?
- Dale.

01:24:56.717 --> 01:24:59.594
- George: Dale. What's up, Dale?
- Hi.

01:25:00.304 --> 01:25:02.347
- You're great.
- (Pen scribbling)

01:25:02.431 --> 01:25:04.683
My wife and I, we loved that, um...

01:25:04.766 --> 01:25:07.269
What's it called?
The one where you play the surgeon?

01:25:07.352 --> 01:25:09.980
Yeah. <i>Calling doctor sunshine.</i>

01:25:10.063 --> 01:25:12.691
Dale: Yeah! Yeah, great stuff.
George: Here you go.

01:25:13.150 --> 01:25:14.484
Thank you so much.

01:25:15.193 --> 01:25:16.278
(Chuckles)

01:25:16.361 --> 01:25:18.155
Okay. Um...

01:25:18.238 --> 01:25:23.327
Well, sorry again for bothering you folks.
Uh, I'll be leaving now.

01:25:23.410 --> 01:25:24.846
George: For all you do, man, anytime.

01:25:24.870 --> 01:25:26.747
Slowik: Well, thank you for your service.

01:25:37.299 --> 01:25:38.899
Dale: Hands on your head! Everyone! Now!

01:25:38.967 --> 01:25:41.303
- No, no. You're joking.
- (All gasp)

01:25:41.386 --> 01:25:42.471
You're joking.

01:25:42.554 --> 01:25:44.014
Dale: I am not joking, sir.

01:25:44.097 --> 01:25:46.725
Slowik: Come on. Clearly,
there's a misunderstanding.

01:25:46.808 --> 01:25:47.809
Anne: Help us!

01:25:47.893 --> 01:25:49.853
Felicity: Yes! Yes!
Anne: He wants to kill us all!

01:25:49.895 --> 01:25:52.123
Dale: Back to your seats!
Everyone! Back to your seat now!

01:25:52.147 --> 01:25:53.774
Soren: He's fucking crazy!

01:25:53.857 --> 01:25:55.108
Back in your chair now.

01:25:55.192 --> 01:25:57.652
Silence! Everyone, back to where you were.

01:25:57.736 --> 01:25:59.696
Sit down. Now!

01:26:00.322 --> 01:26:01.406
Quiet!

01:26:01.490 --> 01:26:03.075
- It's him! It's him!
- Him!

01:26:03.158 --> 01:26:05.494
- Dale: Everyone!
- He wants to kill us all!

01:26:05.577 --> 01:26:06.953
Dale: Do not speak!

01:26:09.623 --> 01:26:10.624
You.

01:26:11.333 --> 01:26:13.752
On your knees with your hands
over your head. Now.

01:26:13.835 --> 01:26:16.088
Guests: Yes! Anne: Thank you!

01:26:17.422 --> 01:26:20.509
- You are fucked!
- Yes! Yes! Yes!

01:26:20.592 --> 01:26:21.593
Lillian: Oh, my god!

01:26:21.676 --> 01:26:24.236
Soren: All these other fuckers
are with them too, sir. Watch out.

01:26:24.262 --> 01:26:25.972
- Dale: Calm down!
- Fuck you!

01:26:26.056 --> 01:26:27.391
- Dale: Stay calm.
- Fuck you!

01:26:28.058 --> 01:26:32.229
Nobody move until I say so. No one move!

01:26:36.358 --> 01:26:38.360
- No, no!
- What are you doing?

01:26:38.443 --> 01:26:39.486
George: Hey, hey, hey.

01:26:39.569 --> 01:26:40.630
Ted: Him, him, him! George: No!

01:26:40.654 --> 01:26:41.696
(Gun clicks)

01:26:51.039 --> 01:26:53.041
Slowik: Thank you, Dale. Thank you.

01:26:58.588 --> 01:26:59.923
(Slowik grunts)

01:27:00.006 --> 01:27:01.049
Good job.

01:27:03.343 --> 01:27:06.972
So, in a kitchen we all work together,
or nothing works at all.

01:27:08.181 --> 01:27:09.901
- (Breathing nervously)
- We work as a team.

01:27:13.979 --> 01:27:15.188
You...

01:27:15.272 --> 01:27:17.941
Margot from Nebraska.

01:27:21.278 --> 01:27:24.865
You... you've betrayed
our sacred bond of trust.

01:27:25.323 --> 01:27:29.661
And you've shown your craft
to be careless.

01:27:30.912 --> 01:27:34.791
I was wrong.
You're an eater. You're a taker.

01:27:35.834 --> 01:27:37.461
Like all the rest.

01:27:39.171 --> 01:27:41.173
(Tense music playing)

01:27:49.389 --> 01:27:51.975
Final course! Plating in five!

01:27:52.058 --> 01:27:53.477
Cooking team: Yes, chef!

01:27:56.146 --> 01:27:58.356
(Indistinct mumbling)

01:28:00.734 --> 01:28:02.652
(Groaning)

01:28:28.178 --> 01:28:29.429
(Tense music fades)

01:28:31.348 --> 01:28:33.183
Margot: I don't like your food.

01:28:33.266 --> 01:28:34.351
What did you say?

01:28:34.434 --> 01:28:38.271
I said I don't like your food,
and I would like to send it back.

01:28:55.455 --> 01:28:57.165
Slowik: I'm sorry to hear that.

01:28:57.916 --> 01:29:00.377
What about my food is not to your liking?

01:29:03.171 --> 01:29:04.214
For starters,

01:29:05.006 --> 01:29:07.217
you've taken the joy out of eating.

01:29:08.134 --> 01:29:11.763
Every dish you served tonight
has been some intellectual exercise

01:29:11.846 --> 01:29:14.683
rather than something you want
to sit and enjoy.

01:29:16.184 --> 01:29:19.938
When I eat your food,
it tastes like it was made with no love.

01:29:20.605 --> 01:29:23.233
Oh, this is ridiculous.
We always cook with love.

01:29:23.316 --> 01:29:25.569
- Don't we?
- Cooking team: Yes, chef!

01:29:25.652 --> 01:29:28.446
Everyone knows love
is the most important ingredient.

01:29:28.530 --> 01:29:29.864
Then you're kidding yourself.

01:29:30.865 --> 01:29:34.035
Come on, chef. I thought tonight
was a night of hard home truths.

01:29:34.119 --> 01:29:35.120
This is one of them.

01:29:35.203 --> 01:29:37.914
You cook with obsession, not love.

01:29:37.998 --> 01:29:39.583
(Suspenseful music playing)

01:29:39.666 --> 01:29:41.376
Even your hot dishes are cold.

01:29:42.502 --> 01:29:43.587
You're a chef.

01:29:44.212 --> 01:29:47.007
Your single purpose on this earth
is to serve people food

01:29:47.090 --> 01:29:49.843
that they might actually like,
and you have failed.

01:29:50.635 --> 01:29:51.886
You've failed.

01:29:51.970 --> 01:29:53.346
And you've bored me.

01:29:53.430 --> 01:29:56.391
And the worst part is
I'm still fucking hungry.

01:29:57.684 --> 01:29:59.686
You're... you're still hungry?

01:29:59.769 --> 01:30:00.770
Margot: Yes, I am.

01:30:03.565 --> 01:30:04.566
How hungry?

01:30:05.191 --> 01:30:06.234
Starved.

01:30:06.318 --> 01:30:07.944
Well, what are you hungry for?

01:30:08.028 --> 01:30:09.404
What do you have?

01:30:09.487 --> 01:30:10.488
Everything.

01:30:12.115 --> 01:30:14.659
- You know what I'd really like?
- Tell me.

01:30:15.827 --> 01:30:17.162
A cheeseburger.

01:30:24.377 --> 01:30:26.671
Yeah, we can do a cheeseburger.

01:30:26.755 --> 01:30:28.506
A real cheeseburger.

01:30:28.590 --> 01:30:30.967
Not some fancy,
deconstructed avant bullshit.

01:30:31.051 --> 01:30:32.886
A real cheeseburger.

01:30:32.969 --> 01:30:36.139
Well, I'll make you a very good,
very traditional cheeseburger.

01:30:36.222 --> 01:30:37.349
I don't think you can.

01:30:37.432 --> 01:30:41.102
I'll make you feel as if you're eating
the first cheeseburger you ever ate.

01:30:42.020 --> 01:30:44.689
The cheap one your parents
could barely afford.

01:30:45.273 --> 01:30:47.150
- Show me.
- How do you like it?

01:30:47.233 --> 01:30:49.069
Medium. American cheese.

01:30:49.152 --> 01:30:51.404
American cheese is the best cheese
for a cheeseburger,

01:30:51.488 --> 01:30:53.156
because it melts without splitting.

01:30:53.239 --> 01:30:54.479
How much will that set me back?

01:30:54.532 --> 01:30:55.700
$9.95.

01:30:57.911 --> 01:30:59.204
That come with fries?

01:30:59.746 --> 01:31:01.122
- Niels.
- Yes, chef?

01:31:01.206 --> 01:31:03.124
- Is the fryer still on?
- Yes, chef.

01:31:04.125 --> 01:31:06.920
Crinkle-cut or julienne?

01:31:07.003 --> 01:31:08.213
(Meat sizzling)

01:31:12.967 --> 01:31:15.595
(Orchestral music playing)

01:32:45.393 --> 01:32:46.394
Hmm.

01:32:54.235 --> 01:32:55.278
Mmm.

01:32:56.237 --> 01:32:57.363
(Chuckles softly)

01:32:58.990 --> 01:33:00.116
(Music fades)

01:33:01.159 --> 01:33:02.285
Now that...

01:33:05.330 --> 01:33:06.790
is a cheeseburger.

01:33:07.290 --> 01:33:08.917
Yeah.

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:10.668
That is a cheeseburger.

01:33:14.339 --> 01:33:18.134
Unfortunately, I think my eyes
were a little bigger than my stomach.

01:33:21.304 --> 01:33:22.555
Well, I understand.

01:33:24.891 --> 01:33:26.434
Can I get the rest to go?

01:33:35.902 --> 01:33:37.195
One moment, please.

01:33:37.737 --> 01:33:39.239
(Bell dings)

01:33:54.504 --> 01:33:55.964
One cheeseburger to go.

01:33:58.174 --> 01:33:59.342
And a gift bag.

01:34:03.680 --> 01:34:05.640
Thank you for dining at hawthorn.

01:34:07.559 --> 01:34:08.685
Thank you...

01:34:10.520 --> 01:34:11.771
for, um...

01:34:15.567 --> 01:34:17.819
For everything.

01:35:10.872 --> 01:35:15.418
Before our final course,
there is the matter of the bill.

01:35:15.501 --> 01:35:19.255
We're on a no-tip system,
so gratuity is included.

01:35:19.339 --> 01:35:21.466
And please enjoy your gift bags.

01:35:21.549 --> 01:35:24.093
Um... some goodies in there.

01:35:25.303 --> 01:35:27.680
A booklet of our local suppliers,

01:35:28.348 --> 01:35:30.391
some house-made granola,

01:35:31.267 --> 01:35:36.397
one of Doug verrick's fingers,
and a copy of tonight's menu.

01:35:40.151 --> 01:35:41.694
Oh! No, no.

01:35:42.695 --> 01:35:43.821
It's on the magazine.

01:35:44.781 --> 01:35:46.449
(Eerie music playing)

01:35:52.497 --> 01:35:53.498
(George sighs)

01:35:54.165 --> 01:35:55.833
I told you you weren't leaving.

01:36:03.216 --> 01:36:07.637
So, once again,
thank you for dining with us tonight.

01:36:09.263 --> 01:36:11.933
You represent the ruin of my art

01:36:13.351 --> 01:36:14.560
and my life,

01:36:15.478 --> 01:36:18.064
and now you get to be a part of it.

01:36:19.190 --> 01:36:23.528
A part of what I hope is my masterpiece.

01:36:33.830 --> 01:36:35.373
(Mellow music playing)

01:36:51.639 --> 01:36:53.016
(Guests groaning)

01:37:15.538 --> 01:37:17.498
Slowik: And now, our final dessert course

01:37:17.582 --> 01:37:21.335
is a playful twist
on a comfort food classic.

01:37:23.129 --> 01:37:24.630
The s'more.

01:37:26.132 --> 01:37:29.844
The most offensive assault
on the human palate ever contrived.

01:37:30.553 --> 01:37:33.222
Unethically sourced chocolate
and gelatinized sugar water

01:37:33.306 --> 01:37:36.517
imprisoned by industrial-grade
Graham cracker.

01:37:36.601 --> 01:37:41.147
It's everything wrong with us,
and yet we associate it with innocence.

01:37:41.230 --> 01:37:42.440
With childhood.

01:37:42.523 --> 01:37:43.858
<i>Mom and dad.</i>

01:37:44.942 --> 01:37:50.364
But what transforms
this fucking monstrosity is fire.

01:37:50.448 --> 01:37:51.783
Oh, god.

01:37:55.119 --> 01:37:57.038
The purifying flame.

01:37:57.622 --> 01:38:00.124
It nourishes us, warms us,

01:38:00.792 --> 01:38:05.630
re-invents us, forges and destroys us.

01:38:06.339 --> 01:38:08.382
We must embrace the flame.

01:38:12.428 --> 01:38:14.514
Jesus fucking Christ! Please.

01:38:14.597 --> 01:38:16.224
(Engine stalling)

01:38:18.392 --> 01:38:19.393
(Guests gasp)

01:38:23.981 --> 01:38:26.067
We must be cleansed.

01:38:27.193 --> 01:38:28.653
Made clean.

01:38:30.238 --> 01:38:31.906
Like martyrs

01:38:33.241 --> 01:38:34.492
or heretics.

01:38:35.326 --> 01:38:37.703
- We can be subsumed...
- (Speaking indistinctly)

01:38:37.787 --> 01:38:40.957
and made anew.

01:38:41.040 --> 01:38:42.750
Thank you.

01:38:42.834 --> 01:38:44.877
- (Sighs)
- (Engine starts)

01:38:54.262 --> 01:38:55.513
I love you all!

01:38:55.596 --> 01:38:57.598
Cooking team: We love you, chef!

01:39:20.830 --> 01:39:22.206
(Engine stops)

01:39:26.252 --> 01:39:27.420
(Sighs)

01:39:34.510 --> 01:39:36.304
- (Distant explosion)
- (Gasps)

01:40:14.967 --> 01:40:17.303
(Somber orchestral music playing)

01:40:59.679 --> 01:41:01.639
(Unsettling music playing)
