00:01.530 --> 00:03.538
Previously on
"Tyrant"

00:03.930 --> 00:07.039
All we know here is blood
 and violence and revenge.

00:07.041 --> 00:10.943
This life that we have...
It didn't cost you anything,

00:10.945 --> 00:13.546
- but I paid for it.
- (Ahmed) <i>Did Nusrat ask</i>

00:13.548 --> 00:15.882
for the annulment,
or was it you and Father?

00:15.884 --> 00:18.417
It was understand that
 an annulment was the only way...

00:18.419 --> 00:19.886
You're lying. 
You and Father can bring

00:19.888 --> 00:21.721
the Palace down around you
for all I care.

00:21.723 --> 00:24.223
I will wait here for you.
Come back, okay?

00:24.225 --> 00:27.059
But if you don't...

00:27.061 --> 00:28.427
General Said isn't coming.
No one is coming.

00:28.429 --> 00:30.797
What do you mean,
no one is coming?

00:30.799 --> 00:32.732
Jamal had
 General Said arrested.

00:32.734 --> 00:34.133
You have to
 get out of there.

00:34.135 --> 00:35.768
My husband
 needs your help.

00:35.770 --> 00:38.971
- I can't help anyone.
- You killed him once.

00:38.973 --> 00:40.406
You can't give up
and watch him die again.

00:40.408 --> 00:42.608
Bassam Al Fayeed
was still alive.

00:42.610 --> 00:44.911
(Leila) You spared him,
 Jamal.

00:44.913 --> 00:47.413
I freed Rami
so he could save your brother.

00:47.415 --> 00:48.414
They're beating back
the Caliphate.

00:48.416 --> 00:49.916
They're fighting for you.

00:49.918 --> 00:51.584
The only way
to preserve your place

00:51.586 --> 00:54.387
in the future of Abuddin
is to sacrifice your father's.

01:00.094 --> 01:03.629
(sighs)

01:03.631 --> 01:05.998
(Jamal) <i>Good people
 of Abuddin,</i>

01:06.000 --> 01:08.601
with God's help,

01:08.603 --> 01:11.938
and after three days
of intensive fighting,

01:11.940 --> 01:15.441
our forces combined
with the Red Hand

01:15.443 --> 01:18.845
have driven the Army
of the Caliphate from Ma'an.

01:18.847 --> 01:21.614
Their so-called leader,

01:21.616 --> 01:26.786
the foreigner,
Abu Omar, has fled Abuddin.

01:26.788 --> 01:31.624
And his puppet, Ihab Rashid,
is in custody.

01:31.626 --> 01:34.293
Leading our
 country to victory,

01:34.295 --> 01:37.029
reunifying
 our great nation

01:37.031 --> 01:40.533
has been a true privilege
for us all.

01:40.535 --> 01:45.805
The people of Ma'an have
our eternal gratitude

01:45.807 --> 01:47.807
and my personal assurance

01:47.809 --> 01:51.477
that whatever rebuilding needs
to be done will be done.

01:51.479 --> 01:54.981
- (Jamal) And that so long as I'm alive...
- (Sammy) Hi.

01:54.983 --> 01:56.983
- Hi...
- (Jamal) I will not sleep and I will never rest...

01:56.985 --> 01:58.384
Have you been watching
this bullshit?

01:58.386 --> 01:59.852
(Jamal) While there is a threat
to Abuddin.

01:59.854 --> 02:02.355
- Yeah.
- Our answer to that.

02:02.357 --> 02:05.024
- We didn't win this war for him.
- (reporter speaking indistinctly)

02:05.026 --> 02:08.561
- My sister and Marwan, Ru'a and Abdul...
- (reporter speaking indistinctly)

02:08.562 --> 02:10.496
They didn't die
for that, for nothing.

02:10.497 --> 02:12.064
No way.

02:12.066 --> 02:13.833
You're not gonna
let that happen.

02:13.835 --> 02:17.169
Me? <i> We.</i> We won't
let this happen.

02:17.171 --> 02:18.838
We did this together.

02:18.840 --> 02:21.574
We can't stop now.
We're only halfway done.

02:23.878 --> 02:25.778
What?

02:28.249 --> 02:31.584
You're going to America?

02:33.021 --> 02:35.388
We're not just
stepping away, right?

02:35.390 --> 02:38.190
That's not what
 I'm... saying.

02:38.192 --> 02:40.593
I just don't know what
part we're gonna play.

02:40.595 --> 02:43.362
I understand. I do.

02:43.364 --> 02:45.932
Just...

02:45.934 --> 02:49.535
I'm just jealous, that's all.

02:49.537 --> 02:52.038
Everything
 we're fighting for,

02:52.040 --> 02:54.340
someone handed you
when you were born.

02:56.744 --> 03:00.613
You have a reason why
your life matters.

03:06.220 --> 03:08.587
I just...

03:08.589 --> 03:11.891
I don't really know
how this will turn out.

03:11.893 --> 03:14.126
I was so happy
 the other day.

03:14.128 --> 03:16.896
Like I'd actually won
 something.

03:16.898 --> 03:19.065
But that's not
how things work around here.

03:19.067 --> 03:21.534
It's never that simple.

03:34.115 --> 03:37.583
You know, my father's alive.

03:37.585 --> 03:41.320
Bassam Al Fayeed is alive.

03:41.322 --> 03:44.490
Which means the
movement is alive.

03:44.492 --> 03:47.493
And that's hope
right there, isn't it?

03:49.931 --> 03:52.431
Things are gonna change.

03:52.433 --> 03:54.900
Don't stop until they do.

03:56.104 --> 03:59.805
Not until I die.

03:59.807 --> 04:02.200
(people chat indistinctly)
(Rami) Bassam,

04:02.200 --> 04:02.610
it's good
 to see you here.

04:02.610 --> 04:04.276
Were you waiting long?

04:04.278 --> 04:06.145
We didn't realize
 you were here.

04:06.147 --> 04:07.947
It's okay.
 I know you're busy.

04:07.949 --> 04:11.150
Busy every day trying to provide
basic services to the people.

04:11.152 --> 04:13.619
- Siddiq's been a great help. (pats shoulder)
- I'll be quick.

04:13.621 --> 04:15.654
I'm, uh... I'm taking
Sammy back to Asima.

04:15.656 --> 04:17.690
I was wondering
if you could provide a vehicle

04:17.692 --> 04:19.190
and maybe a travel permit

04:19.192 --> 04:20.793
so we don't get too held up
at the checkpoints.

04:20.795 --> 04:21.793
Of course.
(people speak indistinctly in background)

04:21.796 --> 04:23.529
I'll be right back.
(people speak indistinctly in background)

04:23.531 --> 04:25.865
Have you heard
from your brother?

04:25.867 --> 04:28.167
- You? (sighs deeply)
- Not directly.

04:28.169 --> 04:30.803
I thought 
you might want to know

04:30.805 --> 04:34.473
that the Arab League
is asking Jamal to step down.

04:34.475 --> 04:36.675
They haven't
told him yet, but...

04:36.677 --> 04:38.677
How do you know?

04:38.679 --> 04:41.480
They reached out to
me... and Solomon

04:41.482 --> 04:43.883
to help contain any
potential civil unrest.

04:43.885 --> 04:45.818
Well, based on his speech
this morning,

04:45.820 --> 04:48.354
they've got their work
cut out for them.

04:48.356 --> 04:50.890
Apparently, the ICC
has new evidence

04:50.892 --> 04:53.492
that he ordered the
gas attack on Ma'an.

04:53.494 --> 04:56.896
From somebody
 inside the Palace.

04:56.898 --> 04:59.398
I don't know who.

05:03.090 --> 05:05.090
(car handle clicks)

05:08.090 --> 05:10.790
(door clicks, hinges squeaking)
(sound echoing)

05:11.846 --> 05:16.982
Mr. Awad and his colleagues are
representing the Arab League.

05:18.186 --> 05:20.653
Please.

05:22.557 --> 05:25.724
Thank you
 for asking us here.

05:25.726 --> 05:28.094
We all appreciate how difficult
this must be for you.

05:28.096 --> 05:30.763
Betraying my husband, 
you mean?

05:30.765 --> 05:33.399
Or sitting down
with an Arab League

05:33.401 --> 05:36.268
that abandoned my country while
we fought the Caliphate alone?

05:36.270 --> 05:37.736
Madam First Lady...

05:37.738 --> 05:40.906
None of us is without
stain, Mr. Awad.

05:40.908 --> 05:42.708
None of us.

05:42.710 --> 05:45.377
But I'm a pragmatist.

05:45.379 --> 05:48.714
And Colonel Al-Ghazi says we may
be able to help one another.

05:48.716 --> 05:51.083
I hope the colonel
also made clear

05:51.085 --> 05:54.420
that our investigation into the
gas attack in Ma'an is ongoing.

05:54.422 --> 05:58.424
Ongoing?
 Or dead in the water?

05:58.426 --> 06:00.426
- Excuse me?
- Mr. Awad,

06:00.428 --> 06:02.728
if you had any real evidence
against my husband,

06:02.730 --> 06:05.498
I doubt you would be so eager
to meet with me.

06:07.401 --> 06:10.803
I will testify
against my husband

06:10.805 --> 06:14.874
if my son has a part
in the new government.

06:17.578 --> 06:21.247
The ICC has agreed
to give you both immunity.

06:21.249 --> 06:24.150
But as for guaranteeing
your son a seat at the table,

06:24.152 --> 06:26.085
I can only recommend

06:26.087 --> 06:27.620
that my colleagues
<i>consider</i> your request.

06:27.622 --> 06:29.288
The Arab League

06:29.290 --> 06:31.924
wouldn't have sent you here
without that authority.

06:31.926 --> 06:33.826
So,

06:33.828 --> 06:35.828
if you want my testimony,

06:35.830 --> 06:38.998
you will find a seat
for my son at the table.

06:46.990 --> 06:49.990
(footsteps departing)

06:50.110 --> 06:53.110
(vehicle approaching)

06:53.110 --> 06:54.140
(Barry) Emma sounded good.

06:54.140 --> 06:56.610
She sounded like school
was agreeing with her.

06:56.810 --> 06:58.950
Did you talk to her
about our plans?

06:58.950 --> 07:00.886
When we're going home?

07:03.291 --> 07:05.191
Not yet.

07:05.193 --> 07:08.627
Listen, um,
I hope you don't mind.

07:08.629 --> 07:11.130
We're gonna make a quick stop
in Tal Jiza.

07:11.132 --> 07:13.032
It's sort of on our way.

07:14.502 --> 07:18.204
Who are you to each other?
You... You and Daliyah?

07:24.312 --> 07:28.280
Sammy, we survived...
a war together.

07:28.280 --> 07:29.650
(car makes creaking sound)

07:29.650 --> 07:32.318
We saved each others' lives.
(car makes creaking sound)

07:32.320 --> 07:33.719
Actually. Literally.

07:33.721 --> 07:36.088
I would not be here,
she would not be here.

07:39.060 --> 07:42.061
We're tied together...
in that way.

07:42.061 --> 07:45.060
(engine roaring)

07:45.166 --> 07:48.534
Even if
 I never see her again...

07:48.536 --> 07:52.071
we'll always be tied together.

07:55.176 --> 07:57.776
Right.

07:58.510 --> 08:02.516
(people chatting indistinctly)

08:02.516 --> 08:06.185
(goat braying)

08:06.187 --> 08:09.154
(goat braying)
(chickens clucking)

08:17.198 --> 08:18.564
I wasn't gone that long.

08:18.566 --> 08:20.199
Look how much
 you've grown.

08:20.201 --> 08:23.235
I built a sundial,
and we have a new goat.

08:23.237 --> 08:25.371
Do you want to see?

08:25.373 --> 08:27.406
(laughing) Not right now,
 Ghani.

08:27.408 --> 08:30.109
Go tell your cousin Ziyad
we're almost ready for lunch.

08:30.111 --> 08:31.944
I... I'll see the sundial.

08:31.946 --> 08:34.446
(Ghani) Yeah.

08:35.010 --> 08:37.710
(Bassam sighs deeply then sniffs)

08:37.717 --> 08:41.386
You look different.

08:41.389 --> 08:43.722
(laughs) Oh, yeah.

08:43.724 --> 08:47.459
But it's like you never left.

08:50.598 --> 08:52.898
I was worried
 about him, but...

08:52.900 --> 08:55.567
he seems to have
held up pretty well.

08:55.569 --> 08:57.102
Yeah. (laughs)

08:57.104 --> 08:59.505
Nasrin really whipped him
into shape. (laughs)

09:03.077 --> 09:05.611
You're, um... 
You're packing?

09:05.613 --> 09:10.582
I'm moving into the house
of Ahmos' younger brother.

09:10.584 --> 09:13.152
The family thinks
that I should marry again.

09:15.423 --> 09:18.257
And Ghani needs a father.

09:18.259 --> 09:22.594
Of course.

09:22.596 --> 09:24.963
How's Molly

09:24.965 --> 09:27.166
and, uh... Emma?

09:27.168 --> 09:29.168
Yeah, Emma. 
They're, um...

09:29.170 --> 09:31.103
They're really good.

09:31.105 --> 09:33.005
I can't wait to see them.

09:33.007 --> 09:37.009
I can't believe you took a
moment to stop here on the way.

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
(laughs)

09:40.314 --> 09:42.848
I have something for you.

09:44.452 --> 09:47.119
I was hoping
(item clatters)

09:47.121 --> 09:48.954
I'd get to give you these.

09:48.956 --> 09:51.490
I didn't think I would.

09:51.492 --> 09:54.126
As a thank you.

09:54.128 --> 09:57.196
Something
 to remember me by.

10:00.134 --> 10:04.136
(sighs) You will remember,
 right?

10:04.138 --> 10:07.039
Years from now?

10:07.041 --> 10:10.776
The Bedouin woman
you knew for a summer?

10:11.979 --> 10:14.880
Daliyah...

10:14.880 --> 10:17.218
(hinges squeaking)
(footsteps approaching)

10:17.218 --> 10:20.386
Should probably get going?

10:24.325 --> 10:26.759
Yeah.

11:19.250 --> 11:24.020
Tyrant S02E12

Sync and corrected by
Gianluca Belfiglio

11:41.769 --> 11:44.303
(phone vibrating)

11:48.943 --> 11:50.442
Barry?

11:50.444 --> 11:51.944
(Lea) Hi, Molly.

11:51.946 --> 11:53.445
It's Lea Exley.

11:53.447 --> 11:55.247
- Exley?
- (Lea) Yeah.

11:55.249 --> 11:57.082
I'm... I'm sorry if I caught you
at a bad time,

11:57.084 --> 11:58.750
but I was really wanting
to speak with you.

11:58.752 --> 12:00.953
Face-to-face
 would be best.

12:00.955 --> 12:03.255
What? You're in Abuddin?

12:03.257 --> 12:05.157
Two floors above you,
but I'm not supposed

12:05.159 --> 12:08.961
to be here. I was hoping that
maybe you could come to my room?

12:08.963 --> 12:11.964
Sorry for the secrecy.

12:11.966 --> 12:14.399
Come in.

12:15.769 --> 12:17.936
You don't look very
happy to see me.

12:17.938 --> 12:21.273
Sorry. I am.
I am happy to see you.

12:21.275 --> 12:22.875
Mm-mm.

12:25.112 --> 12:28.146
Exley, what are
 you doing here?

12:28.148 --> 12:30.282
What if I told you

12:30.284 --> 12:32.784
I was part
of a multilateral effort

12:32.786 --> 12:35.654
to affect regime change
in Abuddin?

12:35.656 --> 12:37.956
Okay, I know
 what this is about.

12:37.958 --> 12:40.626
The state department or whoever
you really work for

12:40.628 --> 12:42.628
wants to use Barry,

12:42.630 --> 12:45.797
leverage
 his popular support.

12:45.799 --> 12:48.534
Barry Al Fayeed resurrected
from the dead as Khalil,

12:48.536 --> 12:50.035
liberator of Ma'an.

12:50.037 --> 12:51.970
I mean, for these people,
that's like, uh,

12:51.972 --> 12:53.805
George Washington
and Thomas Jefferson

12:53.807 --> 12:55.974
all rolled into one.

12:55.976 --> 12:58.544
I'm trying
to prepare you, Molly.

13:00.648 --> 13:02.648
No, you're not.

13:02.650 --> 13:06.218
You want to know
if I'm gonna stand in your way.

13:10.810 --> 13:12.810
(sighs)

13:12.810 --> 13:16.810
(footsteps tapping in distance)
(sound echoes)

13:20.810 --> 13:23.110
(gasping)

13:25.506 --> 13:27.573
Baby.

13:31.045 --> 13:33.605
Oh... (sniffles)

13:36.050 --> 13:38.951
It doesn't seem possible.

13:38.951 --> 13:41.550
(Molly sighing)
(smooches)

13:46.550 --> 13:48.550
(Barry kisses Molly's neck)

13:48.550 --> 13:50.550
(Molly sighs and exhales)

13:54.550 --> 13:56.950
(smooches)

13:56.950 --> 13:59.950
(sniffles, exhaling deeply)

14:04.545 --> 14:07.105
I haven't seen you all day.

14:09.617 --> 14:11.883
Were you looking for me?

14:11.885 --> 14:14.786
What did you think
 of my speech?

14:16.423 --> 14:18.557
It was very good.

14:18.559 --> 14:20.626
Very good?

14:20.626 --> 14:22.620
(scoffs)

14:23.063 --> 14:25.063
You won, Jamal.

14:25.065 --> 14:28.133
You won a victory
for the people.

14:28.135 --> 14:31.136
Abuddin won.
 We all won.

14:31.138 --> 14:34.239
And that's what the Arab
League seems to think.

14:34.241 --> 14:37.609
They've requested
a meeting tomorrow.

14:37.611 --> 14:41.079
Maybe to congratulate us
in person

14:41.081 --> 14:42.914
for handling the Caliphate.

14:42.916 --> 14:46.151
Well, it's about time
 they did.

14:48.122 --> 14:50.656
You were right, Leila.

14:50.658 --> 14:53.592
In spite of all
 my mistakes,

14:53.594 --> 14:56.962
somehow God led me
to save my brother,

14:56.964 --> 14:59.031
so we could save
 Abuddin.

15:01.669 --> 15:04.603
Come to bed.

15:04.605 --> 15:06.672
I'll be right there.

15:06.672 --> 15:09.670
(footsteps departing)

15:11.779 --> 15:13.679
You tired?

15:13.681 --> 15:15.180
I'm wiped out.

15:15.182 --> 15:16.948
Yeah.

15:16.950 --> 15:20.185
This is a real mattress.

15:20.187 --> 15:21.987
So tell me,

15:21.989 --> 15:25.123
do I need
 to lock your door

15:25.125 --> 15:27.459
or do you promise
to stay in all night?

15:27.461 --> 15:30.529
- I promise. Yeah.
- (Molly chuckles softly)

15:33.467 --> 15:35.233
You mad at me?

15:36.704 --> 15:38.537
You're here.

15:38.539 --> 15:41.139
And you're safe.

15:41.141 --> 15:44.176
You'll always be my baby,
but you're not

15:44.178 --> 15:45.944
a little boy anymore.

15:48.515 --> 15:51.516
I'm not who I was
even a month ago.

15:51.518 --> 15:54.519
I know you're not. I know.

15:54.521 --> 15:56.888
All you said to me was,

15:56.890 --> 16:01.059
"I'm safe, Mom. Don't worry."

16:01.061 --> 16:03.762
Do you think
you'll ever tell me?

16:03.762 --> 16:05.699
(Molly sniffles)

16:05.699 --> 16:07.999
Yeah.

16:08.001 --> 16:10.001
Some of it.

16:10.003 --> 16:13.171
Some of it, but...

16:13.173 --> 16:16.742
not all of it.

16:16.744 --> 16:19.344
That you and your dad...
You have this piece of you now

16:19.346 --> 16:22.180
that I'll never
really know, and...

16:22.182 --> 16:23.682
(sighs)

16:23.684 --> 16:25.517
(breath puffs) my guess is,

16:25.519 --> 16:29.354
maybe more than anything I ever
did for you or shared with you,

16:29.356 --> 16:33.125
that's the piece that's
gonna make you who you are.

16:36.597 --> 16:39.331
You made me who I am.

16:41.935 --> 16:44.102
That's why I went.

16:47.441 --> 16:49.508
(praying in Arabic)

16:58.500 --> 17:01.500
(Bassam exhales deeply)

17:05.959 --> 17:07.726
(both sigh) Uh, you
 don't have to stop.

17:07.728 --> 17:08.926
No, no, it's okay.

17:08.929 --> 17:11.530
I'm, uh...

17:14.067 --> 17:17.402
I've... never seen you pray.

17:17.404 --> 17:19.604
Does it bother you?

17:19.606 --> 17:21.673
No.

17:24.310 --> 17:27.646
Actually...

17:27.647 --> 17:29.981
I started going to church

17:29.983 --> 17:31.983
when you were gone.

17:31.985 --> 17:33.685
Really?

17:34.922 --> 17:36.421
Those are beautiful.

17:36.423 --> 17:40.158
- Like rosaries.
- (Bassam laughs)

17:40.160 --> 17:42.227
Guess we're not
so different, right?

17:54.007 --> 17:56.942
Barry, I missed you so much.

17:56.944 --> 17:59.644
But still, when I...

17:59.646 --> 18:01.680
when I heard
you were coming back,

18:01.682 --> 18:04.049
I got so scared.

18:06.687 --> 18:08.353
I get it.

18:11.158 --> 18:13.625
Well, I guess
 we'll just have to

18:13.627 --> 18:16.294
get to know
 each other all over.

18:16.296 --> 18:18.296
From scratch.

18:18.298 --> 18:19.798
I'll take you out on dates.

18:19.800 --> 18:21.299
(laughs)

18:21.301 --> 18:23.168
Hello.

18:23.170 --> 18:24.970
My name is Bassam.

18:24.972 --> 18:27.038
Hello, Bassam.

18:27.038 --> 18:29.840
(Molly laughs, sniffles)

18:29.843 --> 18:31.843
Mm.

18:31.845 --> 18:35.714
Speaking of Bassam, Exley

18:35.716 --> 18:37.816
came to see me.

18:37.818 --> 18:40.552
Apparently, the Americans
and the Arab League are...

18:40.554 --> 18:42.053
I know, I know. 
I've heard.

18:42.055 --> 18:43.655
And I'm, um...

18:43.657 --> 18:45.617
I'm not up for any more
coups d'état.

18:47.661 --> 18:49.661
The president
should not be replaced

18:49.663 --> 18:50.862
by the president's brother.

18:50.864 --> 18:52.564
Anyway,

18:52.566 --> 18:54.733
tonight, I just want

18:54.735 --> 18:56.234
to think about us.

18:56.236 --> 18:57.669
Me, too.

18:57.671 --> 19:00.672
Uh... Uh, we could
call room service.

19:00.674 --> 19:03.008
Act like this is
 our first date.

19:03.010 --> 19:05.010
Oh.

19:05.012 --> 19:07.712
Any chance you might...

19:07.714 --> 19:10.815
sleep with me
 on the first date?

19:13.353 --> 19:15.420
(chuckles)

19:36.420 --> 19:40.420
(crickets chirping in distance)

19:42.950 --> 19:46.785
We've barely talked
since our fight.

19:46.787 --> 19:49.554
It's been five days.

19:49.556 --> 19:52.123
You're the one who's
been avoiding me.

19:52.125 --> 19:53.959
(sighs softly) I know.

19:53.961 --> 19:56.761
I wanted to be able to say
something more than just,

19:56.763 --> 19:59.097
"I'm sorry."

19:59.099 --> 20:02.100
I'm thinking about
 staying here.

20:02.102 --> 20:04.436
In Abuddin.

20:04.438 --> 20:06.471
Because your mother
wants you to?

20:07.607 --> 20:10.909
It has nothing to do
 with her.

20:10.911 --> 20:13.912
I'm staying here because

20:13.914 --> 20:16.247
I want to make the case
of me playing a role

20:16.249 --> 20:17.916
in the future of Abuddin.

20:17.918 --> 20:19.417
What does that mean?

20:19.419 --> 20:22.020
I can't say yet.

20:24.091 --> 20:25.757
If I did...

20:25.759 --> 20:28.827
I mean,
 if I succeeded...

20:28.829 --> 20:31.896
would you do it
 with me?

20:34.835 --> 20:37.268
I won't press you.

20:37.270 --> 20:39.971
I know you'll make
the right choice.

20:39.973 --> 20:42.040
For you.

20:47.814 --> 20:51.016
(clicks tongue) "Warrant
 of arrest under Article 25

20:51.018 --> 20:52.817
of the Rome Statute,

20:52.819 --> 20:54.786
five counts of crimes
against humanity:

20:54.788 --> 20:57.789
Murder, article 7(1)(a);

20:57.791 --> 21:01.659
Intentionally
directing attacks against

21:01.661 --> 21:03.595
a civilian population."

21:04.965 --> 21:07.665
Hmm. (clicks lips)

21:07.667 --> 21:10.535
After all I've done
 for Abuddin,

21:10.537 --> 21:13.671
you come to my home,
eat my food,

21:13.673 --> 21:16.307
accuse me of being
a war criminal.

21:16.309 --> 21:18.143
We're speaking on behalf
of the member states

21:18.145 --> 21:19.644
of the Arab League.

21:19.646 --> 21:21.813
We've defeated 
the Caliphate,

21:21.815 --> 21:23.815
and this is my thanks?

21:23.817 --> 21:26.684
Mr. President,
the ICC's investigation

21:26.686 --> 21:29.988
has made Abuddin's
membership problematic.

21:29.990 --> 21:32.557
The ICC has no case.

21:32.559 --> 21:34.559
I've done nothing wrong.

21:34.561 --> 21:37.996
And everything I've done
was to save my country.

21:37.998 --> 21:41.566
New testimony has surfaced.

21:41.568 --> 21:43.168
Testimony from who?

21:43.170 --> 21:45.170
Tell me,
 Mr. Arab League.

21:45.172 --> 21:48.173
Whose testimony?

21:48.175 --> 21:51.176
All we can say at this point
is that a reliable source

21:51.178 --> 21:53.578
is willing
 to step forward.

21:53.580 --> 21:55.013
Mahmoud, do you know

21:55.015 --> 21:56.548
anything about this?

21:56.550 --> 21:59.717
No. This is the first
I'm hearing.

21:59.719 --> 22:01.553
Mr. President,
we don't expect you to accept

22:01.555 --> 22:03.054
all our recommendations

22:03.056 --> 22:05.190
all at once.

22:05.192 --> 22:08.359
It's a process we
hope you'll consider.

22:08.361 --> 22:11.729
Perhaps you should take some
time to review the document.

22:11.731 --> 22:15.600
Colonel Al-Ghazi
will show you out.

22:16.600 --> 22:18.703
(clears throat)
(chair scrapes)

22:18.705 --> 22:21.265
Uh, gentlemen, please.

22:21.265 --> 22:24.260
(footsteps departing)

22:24.260 --> 22:26.260
(door opens)

22:27.547 --> 22:29.614
(knocking)

22:34.080 --> 22:36.089
(laughs)

22:36.089 --> 22:38.723
I couldn't wait
 another minute.

22:38.725 --> 22:41.726
You're alive.

22:41.728 --> 22:43.795
Khalil.

22:48.268 --> 22:50.335
Come on.

22:53.640 --> 22:55.707
(short chuckle)

22:58.245 --> 23:00.912
I came to you.

23:00.914 --> 23:03.848
Since when does
a president do that?

23:05.986 --> 23:08.820
Why aren't you
as happy to see my face

23:08.822 --> 23:10.889
as I am
 to see yours?

23:14.928 --> 23:18.029
I gave you a full pardon.

23:19.332 --> 23:21.900
Our mother is dead, Jamal.
Because of you.

23:22.770 --> 23:25.837
(sighs heavily) It was
 an accident.

23:28.308 --> 23:30.942
I'm never gonna see
 her again.

23:30.944 --> 23:33.645
How can I forgive you
 for that?

23:33.647 --> 23:37.515
You have to forgive me.

23:37.517 --> 23:40.552
Please, I ask you,
 forgive me.

23:41.621 --> 23:43.655
We're brothers.

23:43.657 --> 23:46.291
(scoffs)

23:46.293 --> 23:49.194
I was lost without you.

23:49.196 --> 23:51.629
You had me.

23:51.631 --> 23:53.865
You had me.

23:53.867 --> 23:56.968
I tried to help you
and you wouldn't listen.

23:56.970 --> 24:00.705
I'm... I'm ready
to apologize to everyone.

24:00.707 --> 24:02.207
To Molly.

24:02.209 --> 24:04.275
Rami.

24:05.812 --> 24:07.979
To all the people I've hurt.

24:07.981 --> 24:12.650
I don't think there's enough
time in one life for that.

24:12.652 --> 24:15.987
I will start today with you.

24:15.989 --> 24:18.389
You can have
 everything I have.

24:18.391 --> 24:20.858
We can be partners,
 if you like.

24:20.860 --> 24:24.062
Equal say, with whichever
title you choose.

24:26.166 --> 24:29.167
We don't agree
on anything, Jamal.

24:29.169 --> 24:32.570
Listen, I... I can't
do this alone anymore.

24:32.572 --> 24:35.673
I can only do it with you.

24:35.675 --> 24:39.410
That's all I ever wanted
since we were boys.

24:39.412 --> 24:42.280
Since the first time
 you left.

24:44.517 --> 24:47.518
I don't think
that's gonna happen.

24:47.520 --> 24:49.520
Bassam,

24:49.522 --> 24:51.522
we can always
 figure it out.

24:51.524 --> 24:53.524
Do it your way.

24:53.526 --> 24:54.892
We can have elections,

24:54.894 --> 24:58.363
real elections,
 if you like.

24:58.365 --> 25:00.632
Just think about it.

25:02.035 --> 25:06.371
I'm not doing this
with you, Jamal.

25:06.373 --> 25:09.440
Just think about it.

25:19.753 --> 25:22.287
(door shuts)

25:30.230 --> 25:33.064
Oh, hey, honey. Where you been?
It's getting cold.

25:33.066 --> 25:34.899
I was in the lobby,

25:34.901 --> 25:36.968
- on the phone with Halima.
- Oh.

25:36.970 --> 25:39.637
(Sammy) Have you heard what's
going on in Heroes Square?

25:39.639 --> 25:42.573
- (Molly) Is something wrong?
- (Sammy) No.

25:42.575 --> 25:44.575
The opposite.

25:44.577 --> 25:46.577
It's all over social media.

25:46.579 --> 25:48.579
A crowd's been gathering
all morning...

25:48.581 --> 25:51.115
Students, workers.

25:51.117 --> 25:52.917
It started out as a rally

25:52.919 --> 25:54.919
asking for Jamal
 to step down.

25:54.921 --> 25:58.256
They say it's grown
to 5,000 people.

25:58.258 --> 26:00.091
And about an hour ago,

26:00.093 --> 26:01.959
they all started chanting
your name,

26:01.961 --> 26:04.962
calling for you
to be the next president.

26:04.964 --> 26:08.299
And, apparently,
they won't stop.

26:08.301 --> 26:11.703
I don't think they'll stop
until they see you.

26:17.977 --> 26:20.845
(cheering, shouting)

26:23.683 --> 26:25.216
(pounding)

26:31.024 --> 26:33.024
(Barry) You can stop here.

26:33.026 --> 26:35.586
Okay, you'll be safer here.

26:40.300 --> 26:42.700
(cheering, shouting)

26:50.650 --> 26:55.020
(crowd chanting) Bassam!
 Bassam! Bassam!

27:07.026 --> 27:09.360
Bassam! Bassam! Bassam!

27:09.362 --> 27:11.896
(cheering, shouting)

27:14.033 --> 27:16.901
(chanting and cheering continue)

27:21.174 --> 27:24.108
(crowd chanting) Bassam!
 Bassam! Bassam!

27:27.414 --> 27:29.914
(chanting stops)
(cheering and applause surge)

27:37.910 --> 27:40.910
(crowd whistles)

27:48.310 --> 27:50.910
Bassam, Bassam...

27:54.070 --> 27:56.075
(man in distance) Bassam!

27:56.075 --> 27:57.742
(crowd quiets)

27:57.744 --> 28:00.278
I'm, um...

28:01.581 --> 28:04.749
I'm not sure
what to tell you all,

28:04.751 --> 28:07.084
except to thank you

28:07.086 --> 28:10.488
for having the courage
to come out here today.

28:11.420 --> 28:13.426
(flags flapping)

28:13.426 --> 28:16.060
We have, all of us,
everyone here,

28:16.062 --> 28:19.464
survived a terrible test.

28:19.466 --> 28:23.234
And if we've learned anything,

28:23.236 --> 28:26.237
I guess it's that...
no single person

28:26.239 --> 28:29.907
can ever mean more
than all of us together.

28:29.909 --> 28:33.277
Not my brother...

28:33.279 --> 28:36.747
and not me.

28:36.749 --> 28:41.419
Today is <i> your</i> day,
 not mine.

28:41.421 --> 28:44.589
This is about <i> you.</i>

28:44.591 --> 28:45.990
So stay here,

28:45.992 --> 28:47.658
stay right here
 in this square

28:47.660 --> 28:49.327
until that change happens.

28:49.329 --> 28:50.928
Demand elections

28:50.930 --> 28:53.664
and an end to dynasties.

28:55.602 --> 28:59.670
That is your right
as the free people of Abuddin.

29:03.170 --> 29:05.670
(microphone switch clicks)

29:05.979 --> 29:08.446
(man) Bassam!

29:08.448 --> 29:10.848
(chanting resumes) Bassam!
 Bassam! Bassam!

29:13.520 --> 29:17.955
Bassam! Bassam! Bassam!
Bassam! Bassam!

29:17.957 --> 29:22.460
Bassam! Bassam! Bassam!

29:22.462 --> 29:24.028
Bassam! Bassam!

29:24.030 --> 29:27.031
(chanting continues)

29:53.430 --> 29:56.030
(low hum of chat)

29:59.499 --> 30:01.065
My cousins live here.

30:02.702 --> 30:06.771
This is where you were going
when you said you were packing?

30:07.707 --> 30:09.307
Yes.

30:11.844 --> 30:13.377
You never lied
 to me before.

30:13.379 --> 30:16.380
No, I...

30:16.382 --> 30:19.684
No.

30:19.686 --> 30:22.753
I thought it was better
that you didn't find out.

30:22.755 --> 30:26.190
And you shouldn't have called me
on the phone, Bassam.

30:26.192 --> 30:27.725
You shouldn't have 
come here.

30:27.727 --> 30:30.194
I've already said good-bye
to you twice.

30:30.196 --> 30:32.930
I didn't want to have
to say good-bye again.

30:34.033 --> 30:37.301
Why should we have
to say good-bye?

30:39.238 --> 30:42.139
You know why.

30:43.109 --> 30:46.043
You have a life
 to go back to.

30:46.045 --> 30:48.546
Without reservations.

30:48.548 --> 30:52.717
And you have to answer the call
of those people in the square.

30:52.719 --> 30:56.087
I know you said
it wasn't about you.

30:56.089 --> 30:58.389
But it is.

30:58.391 --> 31:00.958
The cause may be
 for all people,

31:00.960 --> 31:03.728
but a single person
makes it happen.

31:03.730 --> 31:05.730
You started the job.

31:05.732 --> 31:07.732
Finish it.

31:07.734 --> 31:11.002
You and Sammy and Molly.

31:12.000 --> 31:14.607
(Bassam breaths deeply)

31:14.607 --> 31:18.242
Do it for me then.

31:18.244 --> 31:20.778
I'm one of those people
in the square,

31:20.780 --> 31:23.247
calling your name,

31:23.249 --> 31:26.584
waiting for an answer.

31:26.586 --> 31:28.753
That's it?

31:28.755 --> 31:32.690
That's all you are now,
one of those people?

31:33.626 --> 31:35.626
Yes.

31:35.628 --> 31:38.629
That's all I am.

31:38.631 --> 31:41.365
Not to me.

31:44.604 --> 31:48.673
Daliyah, if you're staying here,
then let me help you.

31:50.176 --> 31:52.943
You have helped me.

31:52.945 --> 31:55.946
You know what I would have been
if I hadn't met you?

31:55.948 --> 31:59.350
The second wife
of an old Bedouin man

31:59.352 --> 32:02.119
in a tiny village
at the edge of a desert.

32:02.121 --> 32:05.656
I never got to be

32:05.658 --> 32:08.125
a solar engineer,
 but maybe

32:08.127 --> 32:11.962
I can be part
of making a new Abuddin.

32:11.964 --> 32:14.799
That's why I came here.

32:14.801 --> 32:16.801
You woke me up.

32:16.803 --> 32:18.869
You...

32:18.871 --> 32:23.708
somehow gave me
 the whole world.

32:23.710 --> 32:27.411
And my life.

32:31.984 --> 32:35.352
I'm gonna send money for Ghani
to go to a good school.

32:35.354 --> 32:36.654
I owe that to Ahmos.

32:36.656 --> 32:38.289
Please don't.

32:39.826 --> 32:41.892
Bassam...

32:43.362 --> 32:45.029
there are things that I want

32:45.031 --> 32:48.733
I need to stop wanting.

32:50.203 --> 32:53.637
You didn't have to answer
the phone when I called.

32:58.678 --> 33:00.511
(Barry on computer) Demand elections

33:00.513 --> 33:04.882
and an end to dynasties.

33:04.884 --> 33:07.551
- That is your right as the free people of Abuddin.
- Did you see this?

33:07.553 --> 33:09.720
What Bassam
 said in the square?

33:09.722 --> 33:12.256
He's inciting the people
against me.

33:12.258 --> 33:16.910
- I forgave him. Why can't he...
- Stop it, Jamal.

33:16.910 --> 33:19.860
(crowd chanting on computer)

33:19.866 --> 33:21.999
It's over.

33:23.770 --> 33:26.036
The ICC is issuing
a warrant of arrest

33:26.038 --> 33:31.375
for five counts of crimes
against humanity, Jamal.

33:31.377 --> 33:34.378
What crimes? Tell me.

33:34.380 --> 33:36.380
They have no evidence

33:36.382 --> 33:39.049
I gave an order to gas Ma'an.

33:39.051 --> 33:43.454
They have the sworn testimony
of a reliable witness.

33:43.456 --> 33:46.524
Someone who heard
your direct confession.

34:04.910 --> 34:06.913
(Jamal sighs heavily)

34:06.913 --> 34:10.246
If you step down peacefully,
the Arab League can get the ICC

34:10.248 --> 34:14.150
to reduce
or even suspend your sentence.

34:14.152 --> 34:17.888
First my brother
and then you, hmm?

34:26.833 --> 34:29.733
You left us no choice.

34:34.106 --> 34:36.172
Well...

34:42.114 --> 34:43.947
(door opens)

34:43.949 --> 34:45.850
(door shuts)

34:47.320 --> 34:49.119
(Molly) Oh, I didn't
hear you come in.

34:49.121 --> 34:51.288
- How was your walk?
- Good.

34:51.290 --> 34:53.991
I needed it to, um...

34:53.993 --> 34:56.627
clear my head,
work through some stuff.

34:56.629 --> 34:58.796
Yeah, I bet.

34:58.798 --> 35:00.631
Hearing thousands of people
chant your name in unison,

35:00.633 --> 35:02.513
that's got to be...
(knocking on door)

35:11.310 --> 35:14.311
Your brother would like
to see you.

35:14.313 --> 35:15.813
About?

35:15.815 --> 35:18.315
He didn't say.

35:18.317 --> 35:21.051
(door opens)

35:21.051 --> 35:23.050
(door shuts)

35:23.856 --> 35:26.957
You abandoned me again.

35:28.995 --> 35:31.061
No.

35:32.164 --> 35:34.698
I watched you
 in the square.

35:34.700 --> 35:37.067
I heard what you said.

35:37.069 --> 35:39.570
- (Jamal clears throat)
- (Bassam grunts)

35:40.840 --> 35:43.507
I'm not abandoning you, Jamal.

35:43.509 --> 35:46.510
I'll be right by your side
whenever you need me.

35:46.512 --> 35:49.213
I'll stand next to you in
court, if that's what you want.

35:49.215 --> 35:51.048
That's very generous.

35:51.050 --> 35:53.050
(scoffs)

35:53.052 --> 35:57.054
We can't make some private
bargain against history,

35:57.056 --> 35:59.790
you and I... It's not possible.

36:01.694 --> 36:05.529
The people that you've hurt were
eventually gonna have their say.

36:05.531 --> 36:09.700
The funny thing,
Bassam, is that...

36:09.702 --> 36:12.903
(clicks tongue) I've done
 so many terrible things.

36:12.905 --> 36:15.439
And now,
I'm signing a confession

36:15.441 --> 36:18.208
for the one thing
 I didn't do.

36:18.210 --> 36:20.878
And for the record,

36:20.880 --> 36:22.713
it was Tariq.

36:22.715 --> 36:25.482
I didn't gas our own people.

36:27.753 --> 36:30.988
But if this is what you want,
I will do it for you.

36:32.980 --> 36:34.980
(inhales deeply)

36:36.128 --> 36:39.730
It's what you always
wanted, isn't it?

36:39.732 --> 36:41.732
This job. This power.

36:41.734 --> 36:44.134
(signing document)

36:45.471 --> 36:47.304
No, it really isn't.

36:47.306 --> 36:51.408
Don't fool yourself, brother.

36:51.410 --> 36:53.477
I hope you are finally happy.

36:55.281 --> 36:58.082
I'm finally free.

36:58.084 --> 37:01.151
I'm paying off a debt today.

37:04.590 --> 37:07.591
A promise I made to someone
that I'd see this day come.

37:07.593 --> 37:09.660
Mm. Who is this person?

37:12.798 --> 37:14.798
Just a girl. No one you know.

37:14.800 --> 37:16.667
Mm.

37:19.805 --> 37:21.772
Now go away.

37:21.774 --> 37:23.841
Just go.

37:27.840 --> 37:31.340
(footsteps departing)
(door opens)

37:31.340 --> 37:33.340
(door closes)

37:33.340 --> 37:35.340
(sighs)

37:37.990 --> 37:40.550
(Leila) Bassam.

37:57.143 --> 37:59.143
What did Jamal say?

37:59.145 --> 38:01.311
It's over.

38:01.313 --> 38:03.447
He's stepping down.

38:13.140 --> 38:16.140
(sobbing)

38:22.234 --> 38:25.769
This was the last thing
I ever wanted to happen.

38:29.175 --> 38:31.241
But now that it has...

38:33.879 --> 38:36.380
I feel...

38:36.382 --> 38:38.949
(voice breaking) I feel like
 I can breathe again.

38:43.756 --> 38:45.989
Yeah. Me, too.

38:47.259 --> 38:49.760
You were right, Bassam.

38:49.762 --> 38:53.697
Not just about Jamal, but...

38:53.699 --> 38:57.201
how this country
needs to be governed.

38:57.203 --> 39:00.938
It took me a war
to realize that.

39:03.542 --> 39:05.909
Ahmed shouldn't be stained
for his father's crimes,

39:05.911 --> 39:08.712
and I'm hoping you will
advocate for his inclusion

39:08.714 --> 39:11.715
in whatever
democratic government

39:11.717 --> 39:13.784
replaces Jamal's.

39:15.554 --> 39:18.622
So that's what all this
is about for you.

39:22.061 --> 39:24.128
Well...

39:26.465 --> 39:28.565
I should see what part

39:28.567 --> 39:31.635
my husband needs me to play
in whatever time remains.

39:57.660 --> 40:00.660
(door opens)
(hinges creaking)

40:03.669 --> 40:06.103
War agrees with you.

40:06.105 --> 40:09.006
Peace agrees with me.

40:10.943 --> 40:13.110
Sorry I haven't had time
to see you before.

40:13.112 --> 40:15.112
Things have been crazy

40:15.114 --> 40:16.446
since I got back
 from Ma'an.

40:16.448 --> 40:18.282
What's going on?
 There's been

40:18.284 --> 40:20.350
people whispering
behind closed doors.

40:20.352 --> 40:21.785
You don't know?

40:21.787 --> 40:23.120
No.

40:23.122 --> 40:26.456
Ahmed's being very vague.

40:26.458 --> 40:29.226
The international community has
made a deal with the president.

40:30.829 --> 40:32.963
He's agreed to step down.

40:32.965 --> 40:34.831
What?

40:34.833 --> 40:38.001
In exchange for a reduced
sentence for war crimes.

40:38.003 --> 40:40.804
Oh, my God.

40:40.806 --> 40:43.740
I didn't think
this was possible.

40:45.811 --> 40:47.544
He's finally
going to be punished.

40:47.546 --> 40:50.881
He's going to be gone.

40:59.880 --> 41:01.880
(brakes squeak)

41:06.880 --> 41:09.880
(indistinct chat in distance)

41:23.415 --> 41:26.583
He's stepping down.

41:26.585 --> 41:29.019
Tomorrow he'll make
a televised speech

41:29.021 --> 41:31.855
pledging his support for
the transitional government.

41:31.857 --> 41:33.257
Barry, that's...

41:33.259 --> 41:36.526
S... So it's... over.

41:36.528 --> 41:38.195
It's not even close
to being over.

41:38.197 --> 41:40.731
We have no experience
of democracy in this country.

41:40.733 --> 41:44.268
Expecting us to learn
overnight, it's...

41:44.270 --> 41:46.270
Now, I know we all
want to go home...

41:46.272 --> 41:48.705
- Barry...
- Just... Just hear me out.

41:48.707 --> 41:50.540
I am not saying

41:50.542 --> 41:52.242
that I'm the person
to lead this country.

41:52.244 --> 41:53.877
I'm not.

41:53.879 --> 41:57.047
But the people are asking me
to speak for them,

41:57.049 --> 41:58.929
- at least for now.
- Dad...

42:00.386 --> 42:02.452
We wouldn't have gone home
if you'd asked us to.

42:02.454 --> 42:05.222
Sammy and I have been
talking about this

42:05.224 --> 42:06.890
all afternoon.

42:06.892 --> 42:09.926
Barry, it's not
just you anymore.

42:09.928 --> 42:11.795
This is our fight, too.

42:13.732 --> 42:16.133
We're with you.

42:16.135 --> 42:18.201
Let's finish this.

42:22.074 --> 42:24.141
Thank you.

42:29.415 --> 42:31.481
(vehicle approaches)

42:34.480 --> 42:37.480
(engine shuts off)
(pulls handbrake)

42:41.480 --> 42:44.480
(cigarette sizzling)
(car door opens)

42:46.932 --> 42:49.333
So... what's so important

42:49.335 --> 42:51.435
that it couldn't
wait until tomorrow?

42:51.437 --> 42:52.969
I tapped the phones

42:52.971 --> 42:54.971
and bugged the suites
of the Arab Delegation,

42:54.973 --> 42:57.441
as you asked, and, um,

42:57.443 --> 42:59.276
this was earlier tonight:

42:59.278 --> 43:02.179
It's a conversation
between Mrs. Al Fayeed

43:02.181 --> 43:04.414
and the lead delegate,
Anwar Awad.

43:06.852 --> 43:08.618
(Awad) The ICC
 is refusing to extend

43:08.620 --> 43:11.788
immunity to Colonel Al-Ghazi.

43:11.790 --> 43:13.323
(Leila) I gave Mahmoud
 my word,

43:13.325 --> 43:14.958
and you gave me yours.

43:14.960 --> 43:16.626
(Awad) I said I would try.

43:16.628 --> 43:18.161
And I did.

43:18.163 --> 43:20.497
(Leila sighs) You're giving me
 no choice here.

43:20.499 --> 43:22.399
(beeps off)

43:31.810 --> 43:33.877
Thank you.

43:37.716 --> 43:40.050
A moment of your time,

43:40.052 --> 43:42.853
Mr. President.

43:42.855 --> 43:44.921
(indistinct chatter)

43:47.226 --> 43:49.292
(metal detector wands whine and squeak)

43:53.699 --> 43:55.332
Today in a
 stunning reversal

43:55.334 --> 43:58.001
for controversial
 President Al Fayeed,

43:58.003 --> 44:00.237
who only days ago...

44:00.230 --> 44:03.173
(reporter fades into distance)
Uncle.

44:03.175 --> 44:05.175
- Molly. 
- General.

44:05.177 --> 44:06.676
Sammy.

44:06.678 --> 44:08.912
- Big day.
- Yes.

44:08.914 --> 44:11.348
(Commander) Present... arms!

44:11.350 --> 44:12.582
(camera shutters clicking)

44:12.582 --> 44:14.580
(clearing throat)

44:17.356 --> 44:20.090
Order arms!

44:21.727 --> 44:24.227
My fellow Abuddinians,

44:24.229 --> 44:27.364
I come
 before you today

44:27.366 --> 44:29.199
at a critical moment

44:29.201 --> 44:31.401
in the history
 of our country.

44:31.403 --> 44:34.271
Just days ago,
we emerged victorious

44:34.273 --> 44:36.706
from a battle against
a dangerous

44:36.708 --> 44:38.708
foreign invader.

44:38.710 --> 44:42.045
In the aftermath
of that victory, we rightly

44:42.047 --> 44:44.748
look forward to our future

44:44.750 --> 44:46.383
with great hope.

44:46.385 --> 44:48.952
I have a firm
 belief in you

44:48.954 --> 44:50.887
and in this country.

44:50.889 --> 44:53.557
But now there is a question
of my role in that future.

44:53.559 --> 44:55.559
The Arab League and the
International Criminal Court

44:55.561 --> 44:57.761
- (Jamal) have charged me with...
- Yes, Mr. Secretary, they are staying.

44:57.763 --> 45:00.230
- (Jamal) ...committing war crimes...
- It looks like we will have another

45:00.432 --> 45:02.566
- (Jamal) ...against my own people.
- bite of the apple here in Abuddin.

45:02.568 --> 45:06.403
For ordering the gassing
of the citizens of Ma'an.

45:06.405 --> 45:08.405
They have made an offer

45:08.407 --> 45:10.740
for me to step down 
peacefully,

45:10.742 --> 45:13.076
to insure a
 smooth transition

45:13.078 --> 45:14.611
to a new government.

45:14.613 --> 45:17.113
No one who is guilty
of such crimes

45:17.115 --> 45:19.983
can continue
to be your president.

45:19.985 --> 45:22.252
However...

45:22.254 --> 45:24.921
there is no evidence

45:24.923 --> 45:27.023
to prove
 the case against me.

45:28.260 --> 45:31.595
- In fact, I have
- (Bassam sighs)

45:31.597 --> 45:34.431
irrefutable, 
undeniable evidence

45:34.433 --> 45:35.665
of my own.

45:35.667 --> 45:37.667
The order to gas Ma'an,

45:37.669 --> 45:40.604
signed by General
Tariq Al Fayeed

45:40.606 --> 45:43.106
proves to the ICC

45:43.108 --> 45:45.275
and to the whole world

45:45.277 --> 45:47.611
that the chemical weapons
in question

45:47.613 --> 45:49.145
were deployed

45:49.147 --> 45:52.949
without my knowledge
 or consent.

45:52.951 --> 45:54.618
- What the hell's going on?
- I don't know.

45:54.620 --> 45:56.286
I did not commit

45:56.288 --> 45:57.954
this crime.

45:57.956 --> 45:59.823
Therefore...

45:59.825 --> 46:02.459
why should I step down?

46:02.461 --> 46:04.828
Shall we allow
 our future to be

46:04.830 --> 46:08.031
dictated by apostate
Arab states,

46:08.033 --> 46:10.300
by foreign meddlers?

46:10.302 --> 46:11.801
Shall we let the so-called

46:11.803 --> 46:15.305
international community...

46:15.307 --> 46:19.209
and traitors within Abuddin
succeed in...

46:19.211 --> 46:20.677
(gunshots)
 (crowd gasps)

46:20.679 --> 46:22.212
(man) Get down!

46:22.214 --> 46:24.481
(woman) She's got a gun!

46:24.483 --> 46:26.049
Got her!
(crowd screaming in fear)

46:26.040 --> 46:27.517
(man) Secure her!
(crowd screaming in fear)

46:27.519 --> 46:29.519
(crowd clamoring, shrieking)

46:29.521 --> 46:32.088
(guard) Clear the room!
Everybody out!

46:33.725 --> 46:35.058
Get back.

46:35.060 --> 46:37.127
Get him out of here!

46:38.163 --> 46:39.829
Bassam.

46:39.831 --> 46:41.831
Forgive me.

46:41.833 --> 46:44.267
I tried... (gasping)

46:45.704 --> 46:47.070
Let him go, let it end.

46:47.072 --> 46:49.673
(Jamal coughs weakly)

46:49.675 --> 46:51.741
He's my brother.

46:51.741 --> 46:54.740
(camera shutters clicking)

46:54.740 --> 46:58.740
(gasping continues)

46:58.740 --> 47:00.740
(Bassam breaths heavily)

47:02.050 --> 47:05.057
(Bassam panting)

47:05.057 --> 47:07.757
This is justice.
