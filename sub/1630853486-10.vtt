the mating is seen as false.

just lay around all day

29:43.825 --> 29:45.244

29:45.244 --> 29:46.912
- Well, it's...

But more important than that,

I can't believe you're here!

all this way just for us?

I really wanted to be there,
but I got held up at the conference.

1:12:08.579 --> 1:12:10.956
- Yeah, I heard you were
working out tactical parameters

1:12:10.956 --> 1:12:13.041
for Selayan outpost design,
congratulations.

1:12:13.041 --> 1:12:16.545
- Well, I've got a bit of a climb
up the ladder before things get good,

1:12:16.545 --> 1:12:19.256

How's my old seat?
You taking care of it?

1:12:25.053 --> 1:12:26.388
otherwise just how you left it.

1:12:26.388 --> 1:12:29.183

you only have a limited time

1:12:32.186 --> 1:12:34.229

1:13:22.694 --> 1:13:27.366
Many crew members have privately
frowned upon your mating with Isaac.

1:13:27.366 --> 1:13:29.535
They feel it will not succeed.

1:13:34.331 --> 1:13:35.541
Isaac.

1:13:35.541 --> 1:13:37.042
You betrayed us.

1:13:37.042 --> 1:13:40.254
Your actions caused
the destruction of many ships

raising your children.

And there's a lot of big life changes
in store for Claire and Isaac.

First off, I'd like to congratulate them

1:15:05.130 --> 1:15:07.341

1:15:07.341 --> 1:15:10.177
I guess it's safe to say
that marriage is gonna be easy

1:15:10.177 --> 1:15:12.554
compared to what
we've all been through together.

1:15:12.554 --> 1:15:15.641
Although it is marriage to Isaac,
so maybe not.

1:15:15.641 --> 1:15:17.684
[laughter]

1:15:17.684 --> 1:15:20.562
The fact that Claire is my doctor
and she's seen me naked

1:15:20.562 --> 1:15:25.567
and is still marrying another man
is incredibly insulting, but...

[laughter]
Anyway... I'll keep this short

1:15:33.909 --> 1:15:36.453
because I know the Kaylon have, like,
a thousand light-year drive home,

1:15:36.453 --> 1:15:37.955
and most of them have been drinking.

1:15:37.955 --> 1:15:40.415

1:15:40.415 --> 1:15:42.543
But, um...

1:15:42.543 --> 1:15:45.963
I just want to say that both of you

1:15:45.963 --> 1:15:48.674
mean a lot to this entire crew.

1:15:49.508 --> 1:15:51.593
We've served together,

1:15:51.593 --> 1:15:53.428
we've laughed together,

1:15:53.428 --> 1:15:56.223
and we all owe each other our lives.

1:15:56.223 --> 1:15:57.724
So...

1:15:58.392 --> 1:16:00.352
when two of us find love with each other,

1:16:02.062 --> 1:16:03.689
we all feel it together.

1:16:04.815 --> 1:16:06.733
And it's a very special thing.

Isaac is fully recyclable.
