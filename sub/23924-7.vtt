Hello, everybody!

00:28.990 --> 00:30.969
It's your boy Sheriff.

00:30.996 --> 00:35.270
Man, I am so excited to be on
my favorite show, "Sheriffs."

00:35.303 --> 00:36.671
I'm probably the toughest sheriff

00:36.703 --> 00:38.120
you guys have ever filmed.

00:38.225 --> 00:39.540
Isn't that right, Abigail?

00:39.573 --> 00:41.308
"That's right, Sheriff.

00:41.341 --> 00:43.811
But don't forget,
today is Momma's birthday."

00:43.844 --> 00:47.115
Oh, that's right, Abigail!
This is Momma.

00:47.148 --> 00:50.251
Today's her birthday and I
have no idea what to get her.

00:50.283 --> 00:51.318
Hmm...

00:51.351 --> 00:56.824
mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm...

00:56.857 --> 00:58.659
- mmm.
- Sheriff, we have a 237

00:58.692 --> 01:01.262
- on South Street.
- Oh, a two three sev...

01:01.295 --> 01:02.597
What's a 237?

01:04.665 --> 01:06.701
Aah! Get your ass away from me, pervert!

01:06.733 --> 01:08.503
Aah, ga, ga, ga, ga, ga!

01:08.536 --> 01:10.171
All right, all right!

01:10.203 --> 01:11.605
Break it up.

01:11.638 --> 01:14.174
Somebody wanna tell me what's goin'
on here?

01:14.207 --> 01:16.444
I was here just tryin'
to sell my products

01:16.477 --> 01:18.313
and this mime tried to hump me!

01:18.346 --> 01:20.415
Linda don't just be givin' it away,
Sheriff!

01:20.447 --> 01:21.515
She holdin' out!

01:21.549 --> 01:22.817
- Mm-hmm.
- Is this true, mime?

01:24.519 --> 01:27.355
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

01:27.388 --> 01:28.590
Yeah.

01:28.623 --> 01:30.859
All right, well, his story checks out.

01:30.891 --> 01:32.659
- You're free to go, mime.
- Hey!

01:32.692 --> 01:35.662
So, Linda, whatcha selling today, huh?

01:35.695 --> 01:38.465
I need to get Momma
something for her birthday.

01:38.498 --> 01:40.367
How about these earrings?!

01:40.400 --> 01:41.536
Eh, I don't know.

01:41.569 --> 01:43.638
Owww! Aah! Aah!

01:43.671 --> 01:46.207
Get back here, you humping mime!

01:47.875 --> 01:50.378
Well, the thing about humpin' mimes is

01:50.411 --> 01:51.846
you never hear them comin',

01:51.879 --> 01:54.549
but I'll find 'im. Sooner or later,

01:54.581 --> 01:56.783
every bad guy has to face the sher...

01:56.816 --> 01:58.852
Sheriff, we have a two nine si...

01:58.885 --> 02:01.855
uh, robbery in progress at Old Town Gas.

02:01.888 --> 02:04.893
Ah, that's my boy Carl's place!

02:04.926 --> 02:05.594
Yeah, hurry up...

02:05.626 --> 02:07.328
Put all the money in the bag!

02:07.360 --> 02:08.662
Hold it right there, robber!

02:08.695 --> 02:10.497
- Aah!
- You okay, Carl?

02:10.531 --> 02:11.633
Carl's cool.

02:11.665 --> 02:13.234
Yeah, I guess I'm fine, Sheriff.

02:13.266 --> 02:15.736
Just calm down, Carl! I'll handle this!

02:15.770 --> 02:17.671
Now, listen here, robber!

02:17.705 --> 02:23.278
Oh, money would be a great gift
to give Momma for her birthday!

02:23.311 --> 02:25.580
You can't give your momma
money for her birthday.

02:25.612 --> 02:26.881
- Huh?
- Uh...

02:26.913 --> 02:28.849
Do something more thoughtful!
Like, uh...

02:28.883 --> 02:31.186
buy her a nice dinner or something.

02:31.218 --> 02:32.920
Gee, thanks, mister!

02:32.954 --> 02:35.256
Hey, Carl,
you got any nice dinners here?

02:35.288 --> 02:37.724
- Um, uh, Sheriff, I...
- Actually, oh look!

02:37.758 --> 02:39.694
This'll do great, Carl!

02:39.727 --> 02:41.329
Momma's Favorite Beans!

02:41.361 --> 02:43.430
It's perfect!

02:43.463 --> 02:44.899
- Sheriff.
- What, Carl?!

02:44.931 --> 02:47.268
Jeez, man,
I'm in the middle of something, dude!

02:47.300 --> 02:50.204
Uh, the robber got away with my money?

02:50.237 --> 02:51.271
Agh!

02:52.973 --> 02:56.543
All right, we're lookin'
for the humpin' mime and the robber.

02:56.576 --> 02:57.945
But in the meantime,

02:57.979 --> 03:00.815
I got the perfect birthday
present for Momma!

03:00.848 --> 03:02.217
Ha, booyah.

03:02.250 --> 03:02.984
- Aah-aah!
- Aah!

03:03.548 --> 03:05.853
Oh, sorry, Goodmans.

03:05.885 --> 03:08.756
Hello Sheriff. Hey!
I see you're filming there.

03:08.788 --> 03:10.791
- Hi, my name is...
- No no no no no.

03:10.824 --> 03:12.859
This is my show. Say, uh,

03:12.893 --> 03:15.629
you guys seen a humpin'
mime or a robber?

03:15.663 --> 03:17.832
No. But I've seen a car-thief!

03:17.865 --> 03:19.467
What?

03:19.500 --> 03:20.768
- Hey!
- My car now.

03:20.800 --> 03:21.635
Hey.

03:21.669 --> 03:23.304
Bye, car-thief!

03:23.336 --> 03:24.771
Bye, Mr. Pickles!

03:24.805 --> 03:27.742
Oh, no!
Momma's birthday present was in there!

03:29.909 --> 03:31.545
All right,

03:31.579 --> 03:33.314
We're lookin' for the humpin' mime,

03:33.347 --> 03:35.250
the robber, and the car-thief.

03:35.282 --> 03:36.850
Aah! My cruiser!

03:37.852 --> 03:38.786
Don't worry, folks.

03:38.818 --> 03:40.655
We got Momma's beans back.

03:40.687 --> 03:42.823
Phew! Wait a minute.

03:42.856 --> 03:45.659
What's this barbecue sauce doin' here?

03:45.693 --> 03:48.296
It's leadin' up into these woods.

03:48.329 --> 03:49.631
Car-thief must be havin' a barbecue

03:49.663 --> 03:50.964
up here in these woods.

03:50.997 --> 03:53.516
Let's follow this trail,
see where it leads.

03:53.517 --> 03:54.835
What? You're not a car-thief!

03:54.868 --> 03:57.905
- You're a car-thief donkey-sexer!
- Woof!

03:57.937 --> 03:59.774
Hey, stop sexing that donkey

03:59.806 --> 04:01.643
and put your hands where I can see 'em!

04:01.675 --> 04:02.809
Argh.

04:02.842 --> 04:04.311
All right, come on, -

04:04.344 --> 04:06.281
Car-thief donkey-sexer.

04:06.313 --> 04:09.917
Aah! Hey, midget!
You're supposed to be in jail!

04:09.949 --> 04:11.918
We prefer to
be called little people!

04:11.951 --> 04:13.954
Aah! Those are Momma's beans!

04:13.987 --> 04:16.858
- Not anymore.
- Hey, get back here!

04:16.891 --> 04:19.494
Those are for my momma-a-a-a-a!

04:20.894 --> 04:24.031
Well,
that midget took my clothes and my gun,

04:24.064 --> 04:26.800
but at least I still got
Momma's birthday present...

04:26.834 --> 04:29.036
what's left of it, anyway. Huh?

04:29.069 --> 04:30.872
Where'd the car-thief donkey-sexer go?

04:30.904 --> 04:33.707
Hey,
stop eating my engine,

04:33.740 --> 04:35.610
you stupid donkey!

04:37.577 --> 04:38.945
All right, we're lookin'

04:38.978 --> 04:41.315
for a humpin' mime, a robber,

04:41.348 --> 04:43.950
- Hey. Hey, I'm on TV!
- An escaped midget convict,

04:43.983 --> 04:46.053
and the car-thief donkey-sexer.

04:46.086 --> 04:47.889
Put some clothes on, Sheriff!

04:47.922 --> 04:49.390
Oh, hey, Mrs. Milton.

04:49.423 --> 04:50.992
Sorry, a midget took my clothes.

04:51.024 --> 04:52.359
I'll tell ya about it later.

04:52.392 --> 04:53.627
First things first,

04:53.661 --> 04:55.730
I have to go home and
get some new clothes.

04:55.762 --> 04:56.897
- Sheriff! Help!
- Aah!

04:56.930 --> 04:58.899
Uh, what seems to be

04:58.932 --> 05:01.735
- the problem, huh?
- These bad boys keep sneaking

05:01.769 --> 05:04.072
into the club and peeping at the girls.

05:04.105 --> 05:06.040
Yeah, we saw all their naked parts.

05:06.072 --> 05:07.674
There were these parts.

05:07.708 --> 05:08.975
Eh woo, hoo hoo ha ha!

05:09.009 --> 05:11.679
Yeah, and this part.

05:11.711 --> 05:12.747
Ohhh! And then they did this.

05:14.848 --> 05:17.517
Stop that!
They probably can't show that on TV.

05:17.550 --> 05:19.586
Hey, uh, you know,
I've been working on an idea

05:19.620 --> 05:22.557
for a TV show,
if you guys want to hear about it.

05:22.589 --> 05:23.924
No no no no. This is my show.

05:23.958 --> 05:26.894
Bouncer,
we need more stringless tampons.

05:26.927 --> 05:29.764
Sheriff?
Why are you naked with a can of beans?

05:29.797 --> 05:31.099
My sister, Candy.

05:31.132 --> 05:33.735
She always gives Momma
the better present,

05:33.767 --> 05:34.935
but not this time.

05:34.968 --> 05:36.870
I got Momma these beans.

05:36.903 --> 05:38.406
- Ew!
- Seriously?

05:38.439 --> 05:40.775
You think a partially eaten can of beans

05:40.807 --> 05:42.377
is a good birthday present?

05:42.410 --> 05:44.779
Well,
it was full before a midget ate some.

05:44.812 --> 05:46.013
Bad news, Sheriff.

05:46.045 --> 05:47.882
I'm already takin' Momma to dinner.

05:47.915 --> 05:50.016
- What?!
- At the fancy restaurant!

05:50.050 --> 05:51.752
- Ah!
- You need to be there at 7:00.

05:51.786 --> 05:53.821
With your can of beans. Ha ha ha!

05:53.853 --> 05:55.856
- Aw, dang it!
- Ow!

05:55.889 --> 05:57.057
- Let's get outta here!
- Hey!

05:57.091 --> 05:58.925
You're just gonna let them get away?

05:58.959 --> 06:00.560
Quick, donkey, go get them!

06:00.593 --> 06:01.963
Owww!

06:01.995 --> 06:04.899
Candy, you got any clothes I can borrow?

06:07.138 --> 06:10.404
All right, we're lookin'
for the humpin' mime, the robber,

06:10.437 --> 06:13.007
the car-thief donkey-sexer,
the midget convict,

06:13.040 --> 06:14.641
and the bad boys,

06:14.675 --> 06:17.745
but I still need a gift
for Momma's birthday!

06:17.778 --> 06:19.781
Hey, look, a gift shop!

06:19.814 --> 06:20.982
Where are you going?

06:21.014 --> 06:22.449
- Huh?
- Shouldn't you be working?

06:22.483 --> 06:24.151
- Mm-hmm.
- Uh, but I need a gift

06:24.185 --> 06:26.620
- for Momma...
- Oh, right, here you are.

06:26.653 --> 06:29.956
- Aah, it's perfect!
- Now go get to the humping.

06:29.990 --> 06:32.427
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh, I know. I got humped, too.

06:32.459 --> 06:34.060
Say what?!
Yo, where that money at?

06:34.093 --> 06:36.163
Oh, there was this robber who...
Oh!

06:36.197 --> 06:39.167
- Someone stole from you?
- Yep, took my cruiser.

06:39.199 --> 06:40.801
And then there was
this donkey-sex thing.

06:40.834 --> 06:42.669
- What?!
- Oh! You dirty bitch.

06:42.702 --> 06:44.504
I told you we tryin'
to run a classy business!

06:44.538 --> 06:46.941
No, I didn't have sex with the donkey.

06:46.973 --> 06:48.475
- Oh, sorry!
- Thanks.

06:48.509 --> 06:49.944
- Yeah, then this midget...
- Midget?!

06:49.976 --> 06:51.745
They prefer to be called little people,

06:51.778 --> 06:53.480
- you offensive
- Bitch!

06:53.514 --> 06:56.050
Right, he told me that
before he forced me to strip.

06:56.083 --> 06:57.518
- Huh?
- Ohh!

06:57.550 --> 06:58.786
You were at the strip club.

06:58.819 --> 07:00.487
Then you must have some tips, hmm...?

07:00.521 --> 07:03.858
Yeah, here's a tip...
those bad boys went that way.

07:03.891 --> 07:05.693
But, don't worry, I'll find 'em.

07:05.725 --> 07:06.961
- Right, fellas?
- Huh?

07:06.994 --> 07:08.696
Hey, I'm on TV!

07:08.728 --> 07:10.730
- No, no, this is my show!
- Oh!

07:10.764 --> 07:12.466
Bitch,
don't you talk back to me!

07:12.500 --> 07:13.533
That's it!

07:13.567 --> 07:15.002
You're under arrest!

07:15.035 --> 07:17.171
- Oh, no, undercover sheriff!
- Get off off of him!

07:17.204 --> 07:19.706
- Run, bitches!
- Get back here!

07:21.608 --> 07:23.844
We're lookin' for the humpin' mime,
the robber,

07:23.877 --> 07:25.479
the car-thief donkey-sexer,

07:25.512 --> 07:27.180
the escaped midget convict,
the bad boys,

07:27.213 --> 07:28.682
and the pimp and the prostitutes.

07:28.716 --> 07:30.951
Aaaaaaaaaaaaah!

07:30.985 --> 07:32.186
They went this way.

07:33.687 --> 07:36.023
Oh, this place is pretty creepy.

07:36.055 --> 07:38.192
Never even noticed this place before.

07:38.225 --> 07:39.193
Mm, what's this?

07:41.762 --> 07:42.963
Pretty weird stuff, man.

07:42.997 --> 07:44.532
Uh! Aah!

07:44.564 --> 07:46.233
Yeah, you should be scared, No!

07:46.266 --> 07:48.201
- 'Cause you're under arrest.
- No!

07:48.235 --> 07:49.737
Aha!

07:49.769 --> 07:52.005
The car-thief donkey-sexer is here, too!

07:52.038 --> 07:54.274
Aah!
That's not a car-thief donkey-sexer.

07:54.307 --> 07:55.308
- Aah!
- Aah!

07:55.343 --> 07:58.278
That's a car-thief
donkey-sexer murderer.

07:58.312 --> 08:00.247
Hey, come back here,

08:00.281 --> 08:03.518
car-thief donkey-sexer murderer!

08:04.617 --> 08:05.819
Make sure you're rollin'.

08:05.853 --> 08:07.221
You're gonna get the good stuff now,
baby.

08:09.122 --> 08:10.591
All right, check it, we got a car-thief

08:10.624 --> 08:13.261
donkey-sexer murderer on the loose.

08:13.293 --> 08:15.762
Well, good thing Old Town's
got a really tough sheriff.

08:15.795 --> 08:16.997
Help! Ohhh!

08:17.031 --> 08:18.632
Aah! What was that?!

08:18.665 --> 08:20.867
Uh, like I was sayin',

08:20.901 --> 08:22.836
no matter how scary things get...

08:22.870 --> 08:24.672
- Ohh ahh ooh!
- Aah!

08:24.704 --> 08:26.740
I swear I heard something.

08:26.774 --> 08:29.877
Oh, man,
I almost went pee-pee in my panties.

08:29.910 --> 08:33.581
I-I mean,
no matter how scary things get,

08:33.614 --> 08:37.118
a sheriff must always
wear a badge of courage.

08:37.150 --> 08:38.684
- Aaaaaaaah!
- Aaaaah!

08:38.719 --> 08:40.955
Ah-ah-ah! Oh!

08:40.988 --> 08:43.758
You guys can edit some
of this stuff out, right?

08:43.791 --> 08:46.594
Car-thief
donkey-sexer murderer!

08:46.626 --> 08:48.128
Come out
with your hands up,

08:48.162 --> 08:50.131
or I will make my gun go

08:50.163 --> 08:52.098
"Bang, bang, bang! Pow, pow!"

08:52.131 --> 08:53.266
Sheriff talk.

08:53.299 --> 08:55.569
- No, don't do that, dog!
- What?

08:55.602 --> 08:58.605
I'm not your dog, dawg. I'm the sheriff!

08:58.639 --> 08:59.974
Come out with your hands up.

09:00.006 --> 09:01.808
No! what are you doin', dog?!

09:01.841 --> 09:02.943
What do you think I'm doin'?

09:02.976 --> 09:04.211
I'm puttin' you in jail!

09:04.244 --> 09:06.147
No, don't put me in there!

09:06.179 --> 09:07.981
Well, if you don't wanna go to jail,

09:08.014 --> 09:10.150
then don't be a criminal,
you silly head.

09:10.183 --> 09:12.886
- Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
- Aaaaah!

09:12.919 --> 09:14.288
- Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
- Aaaaaaaaaaaaah!

09:14.321 --> 09:15.221
Stop right there!

09:15.255 --> 09:16.923
- Aaaaaaaaaaaaah!
- Or I will shoot!

09:16.956 --> 09:18.292
Aaaaaah-aah-aah!

09:18.325 --> 09:19.961
Damn, bitch!

09:21.028 --> 09:22.763
He's dead.

09:22.796 --> 09:26.701
Whah?! Oh, no!
I'm late for Momma's birthday dinner!

09:26.734 --> 09:29.103
Oh, but I can't go,
dressed like thi-i-i-s!

09:29.135 --> 09:30.737
Huh?

09:30.770 --> 09:33.274
- What are you doin' here, Mr. Pickles?
- Arf!

09:35.208 --> 09:36.943
Momma!

09:36.976 --> 09:38.346
- Sheriff?!
- Huh?

09:38.379 --> 09:40.848
I was trying to find you
the perfect present all day,

09:40.880 --> 09:42.315
but I failed,

09:42.349 --> 09:44.318
and now I don't have
anything to give you.

09:44.350 --> 09:46.354
But, Sheriff,

09:46.386 --> 09:48.054
you did give me a present.

09:48.087 --> 09:49.923
Hey, that's me! Huh?

09:49.956 --> 09:52.626
My boy is a hero.

09:52.659 --> 09:54.928
And that's the best
present a momma could get.

09:54.961 --> 09:56.697
- Ohh!
- Oh!

09:56.730 --> 09:58.666
Happy Birthday, Momma.

09:58.698 --> 10:00.166
Gotcha, Candy. Ha ha.

10:00.200 --> 10:04.138
- Are we ready to order?
- Yes, I'll have the beans.

10:04.171 --> 10:05.172
In a can, please.

10:05.205 --> 10:06.841
- Mm-hmm.
- Seriously?!

10:06.874 --> 10:10.211
Oh, looks like I got you
another present, Momma.

10:10.244 --> 10:12.713
- Ha! Mine now!
- Hey, get back here,

10:12.745 --> 10:15.015
midge-e-e-e-e-e-e-t!

10:17.437 --> 10:20.754
Well, we'll find that little stinker,
eventually.

10:20.788 --> 10:22.188
You can hide,
but you can't run.

10:22.221 --> 10:23.723
- Help! Hey!
- I mean,

10:23.756 --> 10:25.358
- Stop looking up my dress!
- You can run...

10:25.392 --> 10:26.527
- Get back here! Aaaaaaah!
- Wait, you can run...

10:26.559 --> 10:28.762
- Look, basically, I'm sayin'...
- Help, he's robbin' me!

10:28.796 --> 10:31.132
Nothin' gets past me,
'cause, sooner or later

10:31.164 --> 10:32.399
- every bad guy has to face
- Oh, help!

10:32.432 --> 10:34.902
- This mime is humping me.
- The sheriff!
