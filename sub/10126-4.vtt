APPRECIATED HER,
AND THEN SHE DIES.

11:44.734 --> 11:46.900
SOME LIFE, HUH?

11:54.233 --> 11:57.233
HA HA HA HA HA HA.
COME ON IN, CORY.

11:57.233 --> 11:58.233
Shawn: COR.

11:58.233 --> 12:00.800
LOOK, HERE'S WHEN
ME AND YOUR MOTHER

12:00.800 --> 12:03.767
WERE TEACHIN' YOU
TO RIDE A 2-WHEELER.

12:03.767 --> 12:06.900
SO OUR FAMILY WASN'T
MESSED UP ALL THE TIME,
WAS IT, DAD?

12:06.900 --> 12:09.967
NO. WE HAD A KODAK
MOMENT OR TWO.

12:09.967 --> 12:13.967
IT LOOKS LIKE
YOU'RE RIDING INDOORS.

12:13.967 --> 12:16.100
OH, SURE.
THAT'S TOYS "R" US.

12:16.100 --> 12:18.233
THAT'S SHAWN
RIDIN' DOWN AISLE 5.

12:18.233 --> 12:21.000
WE COULDN'T ACTUALLY
AFFORD TO BUY A BIKE.

12:21.000 --> 12:24.834
YEAH. MONEY WAS
A LITTLE SHORT
THAT YEAR.

12:24.834 --> 12:26.100
SORRY ABOUT THAT,
SON.

12:26.100 --> 12:28.600
DOESN'T MATTER TO ME.
FUN IS FUN.

12:28.600 --> 12:31.700
YOU GUYS
HAVE BEEN UP ALL NIGHT
LOOKING AT PICTURES?

12:31.700 --> 12:32.867
YEAH. YEAH.

12:32.867 --> 12:36.000
BOY,
TIME REALLY FLIES
WHEN YOU'RE, UH...

12:36.000 --> 12:37.934
WHEN YOU
STICK AROUND

12:37.934 --> 12:39.967
AND HANG OUT
WITH YOUR SON.

12:39.967 --> 12:41.767
HEY, LOOK.
HA HA HA HA.

12:41.767 --> 12:43.300
HERE'S YOU
ON A BEAR RUG.

12:43.300 --> 12:46.300
HA HA HA.
THAT'S YOUR BUTT.

12:48.700 --> 12:52.467
UH, EXCUSE ME,
MR. UNDERTAKER,
SIR.

12:52.467 --> 12:54.600
IT'S MY FIRST TIME
IN A FUNERAL HOME,

12:54.600 --> 12:56.000
AND I'M
A LITTLE NERVOUS.

12:56.000 --> 13:00.066
COULD YOU PLEASE
TELL ME WHAT IT IS
I'M SUPPOSED TO DO?

13:00.066 --> 13:03.600
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE
IN SCHOOL, MR. MATTHEWS.

13:03.600 --> 13:06.600
MR. FEENY, YOU DON'T
DO THAT TO A PERSON,

13:06.600 --> 13:08.367
ESPECIALLY IN
A PLACE LIKE THIS.

13:08.367 --> 13:12.500
AH. FIRST TIME
YOU'VE EVER BEEN
IN A PLACE LIKE THIS?

13:12.500 --> 13:14.200
YEAH.

13:14.200 --> 13:18.767
YOU KNOW, I DIDN'T
EVEN KNOW HER.

13:18.767 --> 13:22.200
ALL I KNOW IS THAT
SHE SERVED US FOOD.

13:22.200 --> 13:24.567
THERE'S GOTTA BE MORE
TO A PERSON'S LIFE
THAN THAT.

13:24.567 --> 13:28.100
OH, CORY,
DON'T LIGHTLY
DISMISS SOMETHING

13:28.100 --> 13:30.467
THAT MEANT THE WORLD
TO THIS WOMAN.

13:30.467 --> 13:32.000
SERVING US FOOD?

13:32.000 --> 13:35.700
THAT'S RIGHT.
AND SHE LOVED
YOU KIDS.

13:35.700 --> 13:38.233
WHEN
ANYONE WOULD ASK HER
IF SHE HAD CHILDREN,

13:38.233 --> 13:42.367
SHE ALWAYS SAID,
"I HAVE 900."

13:45.133 --> 13:47.100
SHE DIDN'T HAVE
ANY KIDS OF HER OWN?

13:47.100 --> 13:49.834
NOT EVERYONE'S
THAT BLESSED.

13:49.834 --> 13:53.667
BUT SHE DID
HAVE A PLACE WHERE
SHE WAS CARED ABOUT,

13:53.667 --> 13:55.567
A PLACE
WHERE SHE KNEW
SHE BELONGED.

13:55.567 --> 13:57.967
THAT BLESSING
SHE RECOGNIZED.

13:57.967 --> 14:01.133
I, FOR ONE,
WILL MISS HER.

14:01.133 --> 14:06.400
NOW ALL HER 900 KIDS
ARE GONNA MISS HER, TOO.

14:14.000 --> 14:15.000
MR. FEENY.

14:15.000 --> 14:16.467
MR. MATTHEWS.

14:16.467 --> 14:22.200
HOW DO YOU
MAKE PEOPLE FEEL
THAT THEY'RE WANTED

14:22.200 --> 14:23.767
AND THEY SHOULD
BE TOGETHER

14:23.767 --> 14:25.233
IF THEY DON'T
RECOGNIZE IT?

14:25.233 --> 14:28.100
DO YOU RECOGNIZE IT?

14:29.300 --> 14:30.500
YEAH, I DO.

14:30.500 --> 14:33.400
WELL, THEN TELL THEM,
MR. MATTHEWS.

14:33.400 --> 14:35.867
THAT'S WHAT
FRIENDS ARE FOR.

14:37.734 --> 14:39.300
THANKS.

14:39.300 --> 14:43.967
AND BE CAREFUL
CROSSING THAT HIGHWAY.

14:47.133 --> 14:51.500
WELL, IF IT ISN'T CORY,
THE LITTLE GO-BETWEEN BOY.

14:51.500 --> 14:54.100
AND WHAT MESSAGE
DO YOU CARRY TODAY?

14:54.100 --> 14:58.233
UH, NO MESSAGE, MRS. HUNTER.
I'M HERE ON MY OWN.

14:58.233 --> 15:01.233
WELL, YOU'RE
AWFUL DRESSED UP.

15:01.233 --> 15:04.000
DO YOU
INTEND ON ASKING ME
TO A PICTURE SHOW?

15:04.000 --> 15:07.100
UM, I'M DRESSED UP
BECAUSE I JUST CAME BACK

15:07.100 --> 15:09.900
FROM SAYING
GOOD-BYE TO SOMEONE
I REALLY CARED ABOUT.

15:09.900 --> 15:12.767
OH. I'M SORRY.

15:12.767 --> 15:17.834
YEAH. BUT I GUESS
I NEVER REALLY REALIZED
HOW MUCH I CARED ABOUT HER

15:17.834 --> 15:20.367
UNTIL AFTER SHE WAS GONE.

15:20.367 --> 15:22.934
YEAH. WELL,
UNFORTUNATELY,

15:22.934 --> 15:24.233
SOMETIMES
IT TAKES LEAVIN'

15:24.233 --> 15:26.700
TO MAKE YOU REALIZE
WHAT YOU HAD.

15:26.700 --> 15:31.600
LOOK, I KNOW YOU LEFT
BECAUSE YOU GUYS
WEREN'T A HAPPY FAMILY,

15:31.600 --> 15:35.667
BUT YOU WOULDN'T HAVE
COME BACK THIS FAR
TO THIS PLACE

15:35.667 --> 15:38.400
UNLESS YOU FELT LIKE
THEY WERE STILL YOUR FAMILY

15:38.400 --> 15:39.934
WAITING FOR YOU
ACROSS THE ROAD.

15:47.300 --> 15:52.967
CORY, I DID
THE WORST THING
SOMEBODY CAN DO--

15:52.967 --> 15:55.600
I GAVE UP AND LEFT.

15:55.600 --> 16:00.066
WELL,
YOU KNOW, THEY FELT LIKE
THEY DID THE WORST THING

16:00.066 --> 16:01.300
BY DRIVING YOU AWAY.

16:03.467 --> 16:06.600
WELL, SON, YOU'VE
BEEN BACK AND FORTH
BETWEEN US.

16:06.600 --> 16:07.900
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

16:10.033 --> 16:12.600
WELL, I--I THINK...

16:13.767 --> 16:18.033
OK. I THINK
YOU CAN MAKE A HOLE

16:18.033 --> 16:20.300
IN SOMEBODY'S
MASHED POTATOES, OK?

16:20.300 --> 16:24.934
AND YOU CAN
MAKE THAT GRAVY
COME DOWN JUST LIKE LAVA,

16:24.934 --> 16:27.500
AND YOU CAN DO IT
3,000 TIMES,

16:27.500 --> 16:30.033
AND THEY'LL
NEVER APPRECIATE IT

16:30.033 --> 16:33.467
UNTIL THE FIRST DAY
IT'S NOT THERE.

16:33.467 --> 16:36.667
BUT YOU, MRS. HUNTER,
YOU'RE SO LUCKY

16:36.667 --> 16:38.000
BECAUSE YOU
GET TO COME BACK

16:38.000 --> 16:42.000
AND FIND OUT
THAT THEY'VE LEARNED
TO APPRECIATE IT NOW.

16:42.000 --> 16:44.133
YOU THINK THEY DO?

16:44.133 --> 16:47.233
YOU THINK
THEY WANT ME BACK?

16:47.233 --> 16:49.400
WELL, I THINK
YOU'LL NEVER FIND OUT

16:49.400 --> 16:53.834
UNTIL YA CROSS THAT HIGHWAY
AND KNOCK ON THE DOOR.

16:59.033 --> 17:03.467
YOU KNOW, IT'S DANGEROUS
CROSSING THAT HIGHWAY.

17:03.467 --> 17:05.667
I KNOW.

17:06.967 --> 17:10.834
BUT MAYBE
ONCE YOU GET THERE,
YOU'LL BE HAPPY,

17:10.834 --> 17:13.567
SO YOU'LL
JUST WANNA STAY.

17:16.033 --> 17:17.500
HEY, CORY.

17:17.500 --> 17:19.500
YES, MRS. HUNTER?

17:19.500 --> 17:23.500

OK. THANKS.

17:43.500 --> 17:45.000
UH-OH.

NEVER LIE TO YOU,

17:48.400 --> 17:54.300
SO I'LL JUST
TELL YOU THE TRUTH.
YOUR MAMA EXPLODED.

17:54.300 --> 17:55.867
WHAT?

17:55.867 --> 17:57.000
SHE'S GONE, SHAWN.

17:57.000 --> 17:59.734
SHE CHECKED OUT
OF THE MOTEL
THIS AFTERNOON.

17:59.734 --> 18:05.500
LORD KNOWS
WHERE SHE IS BY NOW.

18:05.500 --> 18:08.000
WILL YOU BE
CHASING AFTER HER?

18:09.200 --> 18:11.567
NOT THIS TIME.

[KNOCK ON DOOR]

18:24.100 --> 18:26.300
I AM HERE
WITH A HEAVY HEART

18:26.300 --> 18:28.200
TO REVEAL THAT
SOMEBODY HAS SOMETHING

18:28.200 --> 18:31.734
HE WOULD LIKE
TO RETURN TO YOU.

18:35.500 --> 18:38.667

WHAT KIND OF LITTLE
WEIRD THIEF ARE YOU?

18:43.667 --> 18:46.667
I AM SORRY
FOR MY TRANSGRESSION

18:46.667 --> 18:49.400
AND THE BETRAYAL
OF YOUR TRUST.

TALK LIKE THAT?

THE YOUNG LADY'S NAME--
CINDY?
