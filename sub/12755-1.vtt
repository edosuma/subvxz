00:15.892 --> 00:19.437
(ominous orchestral music)

00:23.733 --> 00:26.361
(steam hissing)

00:32.575 --> 00:33.493
What are you doing?

00:33.494 --> 00:34.326
Not up here.

00:34.327 --> 00:35.912
Get back down there.

00:35.913 --> 00:36.829
Jesus.

00:36.830 --> 00:37.746
Morons.

00:40.375 --> 00:42.584
Hey, do you think you could speed it up?

00:42.585 --> 00:45.880
I got another load of sheets
coming from county hospital

00:45.881 --> 00:47.382
in one hour.

00:47.383 --> 00:48.215
You!

00:48.216 --> 00:49.759
I'm talking to you!

00:49.760 --> 00:50.759
You, come on!

00:51.553 --> 00:52.553
Jesus.

00:54.514 --> 00:57.142
(steam hissing)

00:59.602 --> 01:00.437
Hey, move it!

01:00.438 --> 01:01.437
Move it!

01:03.690 --> 01:05.233
[Woman] Yes, sir.

01:17.328 --> 01:19.789
[Man] I want that yesterday.

01:38.641 --> 01:40.727
Good morning, Mrs. Frawley.

01:40.728 --> 01:41.728
Good morning, dear.

01:43.146 --> 01:44.856
You're looking good today, Sherry.

01:44.857 --> 01:45.690
(grunting)

01:45.691 --> 01:46.690
Hi.

01:50.695 --> 01:51.738
Good morning.

01:54.824 --> 01:55.824
Good morning.

01:57.202 --> 01:58.745
You ought to watch yourself, dear.

01:58.746 --> 02:00.476
Let me help you with that.

02:00.477 --> 02:02.206
Take care of number one.

02:02.207 --> 02:04.416
Don't let the pressure get to you.

02:04.417 --> 02:06.336
What do you think about the new girl?

02:07.921 --> 02:09.253
Lin Sue?

02:09.255 --> 02:10.672
Oh, she's okay.

02:10.673 --> 02:12.634
If you're not careful,
you'll end up like me.

02:12.635 --> 02:14.094
I'll keep that in mind.

02:15.845 --> 02:17.429
[Woman] I wonder where
the boss found her.

02:17.430 --> 02:21.643
I wish she'd go back to
whatever sewer she crawled out of.

02:24.562 --> 02:26.564
[Man] Let's get that
second boiler working.

02:26.565 --> 02:27.982
I don't ever wanna see that needle

02:27.983 --> 02:29.629
drop below standard.

02:29.630 --> 02:31.277
Do you understand me?

02:37.742 --> 02:39.869
Watch that pressure gauge!

02:44.165 --> 02:45.311
Max.

02:45.312 --> 02:46.458
Max!

02:46.459 --> 02:47.794
Where are you?

02:47.795 --> 02:48.627
Max!

02:48.628 --> 02:49.503
[Max] Yeah.

02:49.504 --> 02:50.504
[Man] What are you doing?

02:50.505 --> 02:52.131
[Max] I'm fixing the boiler!

02:52.132 --> 02:53.758
[Worker] Coming through!

02:53.759 --> 02:54.821
Coming through!

02:54.822 --> 02:55.884
Back off now.

02:55.885 --> 02:57.073
We're coming through.

02:57.074 --> 02:58.262
Steady now, steady now.

02:58.263 --> 03:00.181
You better tighten the belts.

03:00.182 --> 03:01.014
[Sherry] What?

03:01.015 --> 03:02.829
The belts tighten them with clamps

03:02.830 --> 03:04.644
so we can get a bigger load in.

03:07.730 --> 03:09.732
[Worker] Now, steady.

03:09.733 --> 03:10.566
Come on.

03:10.567 --> 03:12.068
We're way behind.

03:12.069 --> 03:13.610
Ow!

03:13.611 --> 03:15.112
(steam hissing)

03:15.113 --> 03:16.635
[Man] What are you doing?

03:16.636 --> 03:18.158
[Worker] Watch out!

03:19.534 --> 03:20.367
(screaming)

03:20.368 --> 03:22.348
(electricity zapping)

03:22.349 --> 03:24.006
[Bill] Stanner!

03:24.007 --> 03:25.665
[Woman] Sherry!

03:25.666 --> 03:26.957
Stanner!

03:26.958 --> 03:27.792
[Stanner] Sir!

03:27.793 --> 03:28.792
Yes, sir!

03:28.793 --> 03:29.793
Ow!

03:30.962 --> 03:34.924
[Worker] Holy shit, what was that about?

03:34.925 --> 03:36.425
Goddamn sons of bitches.

03:36.426 --> 03:38.803
These two idiots almost killed Sherry.

03:38.804 --> 03:39.887
Damn it!

03:39.888 --> 03:40.722
[Worker] Jeez, I'm sorry.

03:40.723 --> 03:41.556
Are you okay?

03:41.557 --> 03:42.389
Moron!

03:42.390 --> 03:43.224
You could have killed her!

03:43.225 --> 03:44.141
It's nothing.

03:44.142 --> 03:45.100
I'm okay.

03:45.101 --> 03:46.059
Sherry.

03:47.854 --> 03:49.022
[Woman] You may need stitches.

03:49.023 --> 03:50.023
[Sherry] No,

03:50.024 --> 03:51.023
I'm okay now.

03:51.024 --> 03:52.024
Mr. Gartley, sir.

03:53.401 --> 03:54.985
Do something.

03:54.986 --> 03:56.778
Get 'em back to work!

03:56.779 --> 03:59.365
Work 'em like there's no tomorrow.

03:59.366 --> 04:00.490
[Worker] You asshole.

04:00.491 --> 04:02.368
You boys with that piece-of-shit icebox,

04:02.369 --> 04:03.745
get it out of here!

04:03.746 --> 04:04.578
Move!

04:04.579 --> 04:05.454
[Worker] Pick it up.

04:05.455 --> 04:07.207
Deliver on time, or
you'll lose our business.

04:07.208 --> 04:08.207
Move it!

04:10.960 --> 04:12.754
Stanner, time's a-wasting.

04:14.547 --> 04:15.757
Ticktock, ticktock, tick.

04:16.673 --> 04:19.259
(laughing)

04:19.260 --> 04:22.075
It's all right, George.

04:22.076 --> 04:24.891
You know, life's a bitch,

04:24.892 --> 04:26.099
then you die.

04:26.100 --> 04:27.477
Get 'em back to work.

04:27.478 --> 04:28.685
Yes, sir.

04:28.686 --> 04:30.647
We're behind schedule
as it is, goddamn it.

04:30.648 --> 04:32.522
I got deadlines, George.

04:32.523 --> 04:34.192
Never enough time around here, never.

04:34.193 --> 04:36.444
You heard the man!

04:36.445 --> 04:37.278
Let's go!

04:37.279 --> 04:38.111
Move it!

04:38.112 --> 04:39.112
Don't look at me!

04:39.113 --> 04:41.156
You, get back to work.

04:41.157 --> 04:43.201
Come on, get back to work.

04:43.202 --> 04:45.160
Get back to work.

04:45.161 --> 04:47.830
Come on, work with me, ladies.

04:47.831 --> 04:51.291
(all murmuring)

04:51.292 --> 04:54.921
(dramatic orchestral music)

05:18.111 --> 05:21.739
(dramatic orchestral music)

05:41.968 --> 05:42.801
Good morning.

05:42.802 --> 05:44.012
[Mailman] Good morning, officer.

05:44.013 --> 05:44.950
How are you?

05:44.951 --> 05:45.888
Have a nice day.

05:49.142 --> 05:51.497
Shit shit shit.

05:51.498 --> 05:53.854
Got the address?

05:56.524 --> 05:57.357
(grunting)

05:57.358 --> 05:59.277
It's 1216 Lake,

06:00.862 --> 06:01.988
or is it 1218?

06:03.281 --> 06:06.659
(eerie orchestral music)

06:19.464 --> 06:20.757
It's over there.

06:22.967 --> 06:24.676
(car horn honking)

06:24.677 --> 06:26.261
[John] Oh, fuck!

06:26.262 --> 06:27.847
What did I miss?

06:30.016 --> 06:31.016
Shit!

06:36.814 --> 06:37.814
Hey!

06:38.900 --> 06:40.610
Idiot, what was that?

06:41.861 --> 06:44.071
Hey, what was that?

06:44.072 --> 06:45.782
Hey, idiot, I'm talking to you.

06:45.783 --> 06:47.240
Hey, hey, hey!

06:47.241 --> 06:49.118
No, I'm talking to the other idiot.

06:49.119 --> 06:49.952
What was that?

06:49.953 --> 06:50.827
What?

06:50.828 --> 06:51.662
Can't you drive?

06:51.663 --> 06:52.496
Move the truck.

06:52.497 --> 06:53.330
Sir, we're just delivering an icebox.

06:53.331 --> 06:54.791
I don't give a fuck if you're delivering

06:54.792 --> 06:55.812
a pizza to the pope.

06:55.813 --> 06:56.833
Move the fucking truck.

06:56.834 --> 06:58.919
You looking for trouble, asshole?

06:58.920 --> 07:01.005
That's officer asshole to you.

07:02.715 --> 07:05.259
Move the truck, and then we'll talk, okay?

07:05.260 --> 07:06.259
Okay.

07:18.815 --> 07:21.192
Sorry about your hand, Sherry.

07:23.403 --> 07:26.781
(eerie orchestral music)

07:48.344 --> 07:50.972
(steam hissing)

07:57.395 --> 07:58.354
[Man] Boss, you're not kidding.

07:58.355 --> 08:00.605
This icebox is hot.

08:00.606 --> 08:03.693
All right, Mr. Gates, it's time to talk.

08:05.319 --> 08:07.613
It seems that your driver's
license has expired.

08:07.614 --> 08:08.448
Watch out!

08:08.449 --> 08:09.448
Shit!

08:10.158 --> 08:10.991
[Man] Uh!

08:10.992 --> 08:12.075
Oh, I'm really sorry, officer.

08:12.076 --> 08:13.828
Get this goddamn thing off of me!

08:17.498 --> 08:18.498
Shit!

08:21.878 --> 08:23.044
Numbnuts!

08:23.045 --> 08:24.212
Jesus!

08:25.047 --> 08:27.675
(steam hissing)

08:45.943 --> 08:46.943
Ow!

08:48.821 --> 08:52.200
(eerie orchestral music)

08:54.035 --> 08:55.723
Are you okay?

08:55.724 --> 08:57.412
Frawley!

08:57.413 --> 08:59.081
There's no time for daydreaming.

08:59.082 --> 09:01.187
I've got another load coming in.

09:01.188 --> 09:03.294
Now, both of you, back to work!

09:04.712 --> 09:05.712
Ow!

09:10.468 --> 09:12.094
Bring the ratchet.

09:24.982 --> 09:25.982
Oh!

09:28.027 --> 09:29.027
Aah!

09:31.989 --> 09:34.242
(screaming)

09:35.618 --> 09:36.555
Oh, god!

09:36.556 --> 09:37.494
Help me!

09:38.913 --> 09:39.913
Oh God.

09:39.914 --> 09:41.207
Help me, please!

09:42.625 --> 09:44.669
(screaming)

09:44.670 --> 09:46.462
No!

09:48.130 --> 09:49.465
(screaming)

09:49.466 --> 09:50.298
Aah!

09:50.299 --> 09:52.321
(metal clanging)

09:52.322 --> 09:54.345
(all screaming)

09:55.263 --> 09:57.515
Hell's bells, Adelle!

09:57.516 --> 09:58.641
Shut it off!

09:59.600 --> 10:01.143
I don't know how!

10:01.144 --> 10:02.143
Aah!

10:03.646 --> 10:05.273
It won't shut off!

10:07.984 --> 10:09.110
Shut it off!

10:10.319 --> 10:11.946
It won't shut off!

10:14.323 --> 10:16.617
(screaming)

10:21.330 --> 10:22.664
Goddamn!

10:22.665 --> 10:24.292
(metal clanging)

10:24.293 --> 10:26.918
(grunting)

10:26.919 --> 10:28.045
Get back, get back!

10:28.046 --> 10:28.879
Mrs. Frawley!

10:28.880 --> 10:29.714
Oh, my god!

10:29.715 --> 10:30.548
Jesus!

10:30.549 --> 10:31.507
Oh, god!

10:31.508 --> 10:32.550
(screaming)

10:32.551 --> 10:33.593
Out of my way!

10:40.266 --> 10:41.266
Oh, oh, oh!

10:52.069 --> 10:53.195
Oh, Frawley!

10:54.363 --> 10:56.157
You stupid old bitch!

10:57.199 --> 10:59.326
Always getting in the way.

10:59.327 --> 11:01.454
Goddamn it, goddamn it!

11:01.455 --> 11:02.495
Goddamn it!

11:02.496 --> 11:04.289
Now, what's that for?

11:04.290 --> 11:06.459
Reckless driving, illegal parking,

11:06.460 --> 11:08.294
blocking of a public street.

11:08.295 --> 11:09.128
Come on, pal.

11:09.129 --> 11:09.962
Give me a break.

11:09.963 --> 11:10.963
What do you want?

11:10.964 --> 11:11.963
Insulting an officer?

11:11.964 --> 11:14.800
Or being an arrogant,
ignorant son of a bitch?

11:14.801 --> 11:16.218
Since when is that a crime?

11:17.261 --> 11:18.762
Help me, boss!

11:18.763 --> 11:20.973
Aw, you broke my damn watch.

11:20.974 --> 11:21.806
I'm all pooped out.

11:21.807 --> 11:22.767
[Molly] Officer Hunton, come in.

11:22.768 --> 11:23.600
Damn it.

11:23.601 --> 11:24.643
You're a moron.

11:24.644 --> 11:27.063
[Molly] Officer Hunton, come in.

11:30.107 --> 11:31.107
Officer Hunton.

11:32.360 --> 11:33.402
Yeah, yeah.

11:34.695 --> 11:35.904
Yeah, Molly, what have you got?

11:35.905 --> 11:37.114
[Molly] Good morning, Johnny.

11:37.115 --> 11:38.448
How's your day so far?

11:38.449 --> 11:39.950
Oh, my day's peachy, Molly.

11:39.951 --> 11:40.909
What's up?

11:40.910 --> 11:43.162
[Molly] We've got a death
at the Blue Ribbon Laundry.

11:43.163 --> 11:44.246
It's a bad one.

11:45.873 --> 11:48.751
Sheriff Hughes got called
away to an urgent meeting.

11:48.752 --> 11:50.795
[Man] I need some help.

11:51.837 --> 11:53.129
[Molly] What's going on,

11:53.130 --> 11:55.383
and how many did you take this time?

11:57.009 --> 11:58.302
[Man] Right side up.

11:58.303 --> 11:59.135
Come on.

11:59.136 --> 12:00.513
All right, Molly, I'm on the way.

12:00.514 --> 12:01.555
Thanks a lot.

12:05.142 --> 12:08.771
(dramatic orchestral music)

12:28.833 --> 12:30.333
(crying)

12:30.334 --> 12:31.377
Oh, my god!

12:33.379 --> 12:34.379
Oh, my god!

12:35.798 --> 12:36.798
No!

12:38.676 --> 12:39.676
No!

12:44.014 --> 12:45.306
Sherry, it's okay.

12:45.307 --> 12:46.599
Get away from me!

12:46.600 --> 12:47.872
Her worries are over.

12:47.873 --> 12:49.145
Get away from me!

12:50.062 --> 12:52.106
(crying)

12:53.315 --> 12:56.110
(crowd murmuring)

13:06.871 --> 13:09.498
(steam hissing)

13:11.917 --> 13:12.917
Holy shit.

13:24.638 --> 13:25.638
Hello.

13:27.308 --> 13:29.559
Is Mr. Gartley here?

13:29.560 --> 13:32.396
Mr. Gartley is unavailable.

13:32.397 --> 13:33.396
I'm Stanner.

13:34.398 --> 13:35.795
I'm the foreman.

13:35.796 --> 13:37.192
Mr. Stanner,

13:37.193 --> 13:38.944
I'm, uh I'm officer Hunton.

13:40.696 --> 13:43.115
Can you show me what
happened, Mr. Stanner?

13:44.825 --> 13:45.826
Do I have to?

13:46.994 --> 13:48.078
Yeah, you have to.

13:49.205 --> 13:50.038
She's down there.

13:50.039 --> 13:52.541
I, I can't look at it again.

13:52.542 --> 13:54.126
It makes me sick.

13:55.211 --> 13:56.045
She's down there.

13:56.046 --> 13:57.004
I can't.

13:57.005 --> 13:57.962
I'm sorry.

13:57.963 --> 13:58.755
I can't look at it.

13:58.756 --> 14:00.216
Yeah, right, you can't look.

14:01.926 --> 14:04.136
(scoffing)

14:07.097 --> 14:09.975
Run a loose shop, cut
corners what do you expect?

14:09.976 --> 14:12.728
People get hurt or killed, right?

14:12.729 --> 14:14.917
And then he can't look.

14:14.918 --> 14:17.107
No, he can't look at it.

14:18.442 --> 14:19.276
(camera flashing)

14:19.277 --> 14:20.527
Oh.

14:20.528 --> 14:22.863
Hell of a mess, huh, Johnny?

14:24.365 --> 14:26.282
You know, me and my old camera

14:26.283 --> 14:30.079
were doing this long before
you even came to this town.

14:30.080 --> 14:31.497
Never did get used to it.

14:34.208 --> 14:35.334
Yeah, right.

14:36.752 --> 14:38.546
(camera flashing)

14:38.547 --> 14:39.546
Oh.

14:42.258 --> 14:43.467
Um, pictureman,

14:45.135 --> 14:48.430
make sure I get some copies of that.

14:48.431 --> 14:50.306
Like always.

14:50.307 --> 14:51.892
Have I ever let you down?

14:53.853 --> 14:54.853
Yes.

15:00.150 --> 15:02.903
(camera flashing)

15:04.947 --> 15:07.324
(gagging)

15:07.325 --> 15:09.702
(vomiting)

15:20.254 --> 15:21.504
I feel like it's all my fault.

15:21.505 --> 15:22.756
I just wasn't strong enough.

15:22.757 --> 15:23.591
I tried to help her.

15:23.592 --> 15:24.507
I tried...

15:24.508 --> 15:25.593
Okay, it's all right.

15:25.594 --> 15:26.426
It's all right.

15:26.427 --> 15:30.347
Excuse me, excuse me.

15:30.348 --> 15:31.347
It's okay.

15:35.477 --> 15:36.477
Excuse me.

15:39.356 --> 15:40.399
I know how you feel.

15:42.109 --> 15:43.193
Have you seen that machine?

15:44.612 --> 15:46.697
It makes me sick to my stomach.

15:49.533 --> 15:51.159
(sighing)

15:51.160 --> 15:52.160
These will help.

15:53.621 --> 15:55.247
Mrs. Frawley used to take 'em.

16:03.839 --> 16:04.965
Oh, keep the bottle.

16:07.676 --> 16:08.676
Thank you.

16:11.764 --> 16:13.223
Annette Gillian.

16:14.808 --> 16:15.975
Uh, John Hunton.

16:15.976 --> 16:17.144
How do you do?

16:17.145 --> 16:20.188
Hi.

16:20.189 --> 16:22.816
Oh, poor Mrs. Frawley.

16:22.817 --> 16:23.816
Oh, god!

16:25.027 --> 16:27.071
(crying)

16:43.671 --> 16:44.921
Hey, what's going on?

16:44.922 --> 16:46.172
Nothing, Johnny.

16:46.173 --> 16:47.967
We're here to settle a safety issue.

16:47.968 --> 16:50.301
What's the emergency, anyway?

16:50.302 --> 16:51.303
[Officer] There's been an
accident with a speed ironer.

16:51.304 --> 16:52.303
Let's go in.

16:57.309 --> 17:00.938
(dramatic orchestral music)

17:27.506 --> 17:29.008
If the safety features on this machine

17:29.009 --> 17:30.926
meet state and local standards,

17:30.927 --> 17:32.844
then you may resume operation.

17:32.845 --> 17:34.638
[Stanner] Yes, thank you, Judge Bishop.

17:34.639 --> 17:36.452
Okay, Martin, start her up.

17:36.453 --> 17:38.267
[Martin] Stand clear, boys.

17:45.232 --> 17:47.400
Let's start with the safety bar.

17:47.401 --> 17:49.653
When I lift this up,
the machine should stop.

17:53.323 --> 17:56.284
Put it down, it should start.

17:56.285 --> 17:58.746
[Judge] What is your
conclusion, Mr. Martin?

17:58.747 --> 17:59.620
Well, I'll tell you, Judge Bishop,

17:59.621 --> 18:01.665
the safety bar seems to be working fine.

18:01.666 --> 18:03.667
[Judge] Then I declare that this

18:03.668 --> 18:05.669
was a case of accidental death.

18:05.670 --> 18:07.379
This inquest is closed.

18:08.756 --> 18:09.965
I know what you think of my work.

18:09.966 --> 18:10.965
Look, there's no such thing

18:10.966 --> 18:13.885
as empirical truth in
theoretical parapsychology.

18:13.886 --> 18:16.680
If you saw Seraphims and
Cherubims falling out of the sky,

18:16.681 --> 18:19.475
singing hallelujah, you
wouldn't believe it.

18:19.476 --> 18:21.518
You want proof, right?

18:21.519 --> 18:23.562
Oh, you'll never change.

18:24.605 --> 18:28.192
(dramatic orchestral music)

18:31.612 --> 18:32.696
You haven't eaten much.

18:34.448 --> 18:35.281
Why?

18:35.282 --> 18:36.283
You're not feeling well?

18:37.701 --> 18:39.515
There was an accident today,

18:39.516 --> 18:41.330
the worst one I've ever seen.

18:41.331 --> 18:42.330
Messy?

18:52.174 --> 18:55.302
So how long is it now
you've been chasing corpses?

18:56.553 --> 18:57.804
14 years.

18:57.805 --> 19:00.765
Oh, man, 14 years.

19:00.766 --> 19:02.226
Ha, you know, you need to spend some

19:02.227 --> 19:04.520
more time with the living.

19:04.521 --> 19:06.646
(chuckling)

19:06.647 --> 19:08.440
Jesus, you sound just like Sandy.

19:12.778 --> 19:14.071
Sandra really loved you.

19:14.072 --> 19:14.946
Whatever.

19:14.947 --> 19:18.658
Uh, I just I just got to hang in there

19:18.659 --> 19:22.371
and get my 20 years in so I can retire

19:22.372 --> 19:24.331
and get the fuck out of this town

19:24.332 --> 19:26.290
before I turn completely numb.

19:26.291 --> 19:28.689
Yeah, well, uh, you know, Johnny,

19:28.690 --> 19:31.088
you really do need to get a life.

19:35.884 --> 19:37.219
I got a life.

19:40.305 --> 19:41.723
What I need is a beer.

19:43.517 --> 19:45.601
Come over if you want.

19:45.602 --> 19:46.979
I don't suppose you know anything

19:46.980 --> 19:48.104
about industrial laundries?

19:48.105 --> 19:50.274
You know, I used to work
in an industrial laundry

19:50.275 --> 19:52.234
when I was an undergraduate at Berkeley.

19:53.277 --> 19:54.131
Get out of here.

19:54.132 --> 19:54.976
I did, man.

19:54.977 --> 19:55.820
Really?

19:55.821 --> 19:56.946
Yeah, sure.

19:56.947 --> 20:00.576
Well, look, do you know that machine

20:00.577 --> 20:02.202
they call the speed ironer?

20:02.203 --> 20:03.035
Oh, man, yeah.

20:03.036 --> 20:05.080
It's called a mangle.

20:05.081 --> 20:06.081
A mangler?

20:06.082 --> 20:07.081
Mangle.

20:07.082 --> 20:08.645
That's the one.

20:08.646 --> 20:10.209
That's the one.

20:12.713 --> 20:14.464
It mangled a woman this morning.

20:14.465 --> 20:15.298
Oh!

20:15.299 --> 20:17.467
Over at Mr. Gartley's
Blue Ribbon Laundry.

20:19.469 --> 20:22.471
It...

20:22.472 --> 20:24.641
There was hardly anything left of her.

20:24.642 --> 20:25.474
No way.

20:25.475 --> 20:26.309
No way, man.

20:26.310 --> 20:27.268
That can't happen.

20:27.269 --> 20:28.102
You've got a safety bar.

20:28.103 --> 20:30.042
If someone's feeding the machine

20:30.043 --> 20:31.981
and get their hand underneath,

20:31.982 --> 20:34.401
the bar snaps up and
turns the damn thing off.

20:34.402 --> 20:35.234
Right.

20:35.235 --> 20:36.652
Well, that's how I remember it.

20:36.653 --> 20:38.071
Yeah, it's got a safety bar,

20:38.072 --> 20:39.489
but it happened anyhow.

20:40.574 --> 20:41.783
Oh, god.

20:42.701 --> 20:43.869
Man, what a way to go.

20:47.581 --> 20:48.582
I hated that machine.

20:50.209 --> 20:53.253
(machinery clanging)

20:54.504 --> 20:58.050
(ominous orchestral music)

21:04.556 --> 21:05.953
Oh, fuck me!

21:05.954 --> 21:07.350
I can't do this!

21:07.351 --> 21:08.810
Well, it is what it is, right?

21:08.811 --> 21:09.936
Johnny, don't.

21:09.937 --> 21:11.063
I mean, you can't-

21:11.064 --> 21:12.146
What?

21:12.147 --> 21:13.482
A woman's dead, Mark.

21:15.525 --> 21:17.319
It folded her like a sheet.

21:20.822 --> 21:22.449
They carried her out in a basket.

21:25.285 --> 21:26.410
Whose ass is on the line?

21:26.411 --> 21:28.183
Nobody's ass is on the line.

21:28.184 --> 21:29.945
Gartley owns Judge Bishop.

21:29.946 --> 21:31.708
Judge Bishop owns the sheriff.

21:31.709 --> 21:33.919
I mean, it's all dirty.

21:33.920 --> 21:34.752
It's all dirty.

21:34.753 --> 21:36.213
Yeah, but why are you fighting it, man?

21:36.214 --> 21:38.089
I mean, wake up.

21:38.090 --> 21:39.548
I've been in this town long enough

21:39.549 --> 21:41.385
to know that there's some
strange shit going on.

21:41.386 --> 21:44.220
It's always been
narrow-minded and corrupt.

21:44.221 --> 21:48.308
Hell, they used to burn witches
just 10 miles from here.

21:48.309 --> 21:50.978
This puritanical ethic
is still hanging over...

21:50.979 --> 21:53.814
Look, don't start with the sprout-breath

21:53.815 --> 21:55.774
political mystical bullshit, Mark.

21:55.775 --> 21:57.734
I'm not in the mood this evening.

21:57.735 --> 21:58.734
Thank you.

22:01.321 --> 22:02.780
The woman's dead,

22:02.781 --> 22:05.992
and that machine is running right now,

22:05.993 --> 22:08.870
all right, like nothing
happened business as usual.

22:10.372 --> 22:13.375
Six miles from here, six miles.

22:14.459 --> 22:15.293
Oh, whatever.

22:15.294 --> 22:17.587
What are you supposed
to do about it, huh?

22:17.588 --> 22:18.505
[John] Have a beer.

22:18.506 --> 22:19.381
That's what I'll do.

22:19.382 --> 22:20.256
[Mark] Then what?

22:20.257 --> 22:21.091
You're going to take the sins of the world

22:21.092 --> 22:21.925
on your shoulders?

22:21.926 --> 22:22.758
It's your fault?

22:22.759 --> 22:24.218
I mean, you have to live a little.

22:24.219 --> 22:25.679
You can't just take everything in.

22:25.680 --> 22:26.763
[John] Yeah, you're right.

22:26.764 --> 22:27.618
[Mark] Come on.

22:27.619 --> 22:28.472
Just live a little.

22:28.473 --> 22:31.435
You're going to get a
goddamn nervous breakdown.

22:31.436 --> 22:32.852
I'm worried about you.

22:32.853 --> 22:34.479
[John] You want some yogurt?

22:34.480 --> 22:35.354
I got some yogurt.

22:35.355 --> 22:36.648
[Mark] Is it whole-wheat?

22:36.649 --> 22:37.607
[John] Granola?

22:37.608 --> 22:38.566
I got granola.

22:38.567 --> 22:40.277
[Mark] Yeah, is it organic?

22:40.278 --> 22:41.277
[John] No.

22:42.362 --> 22:45.991
(ominous atmospheric music)

22:47.492 --> 22:48.326
Are you okay?

22:48.327 --> 22:50.370
I wish I could go home.

22:57.919 --> 22:59.733
(wire blowing)

22:59.734 --> 23:01.548
(all screaming)

23:05.761 --> 23:07.220
[Stanner] Move away!

23:07.221 --> 23:08.680
Move away from there!

23:12.309 --> 23:13.351
Move away!

23:13.352 --> 23:15.437
Move away from there!

23:15.438 --> 23:16.646
Do something!

23:19.775 --> 23:22.444
[Stanner] Shut that damn thing off!

23:23.362 --> 23:24.362
Inside.

23:29.326 --> 23:31.369
(crying)

23:31.370 --> 23:34.956
(dramatic orchestral music)

23:50.889 --> 23:52.682
[Lin Sue] I'm sorry.

23:57.521 --> 23:59.564
Chaos abounds, my dear.

24:01.108 --> 24:02.442
You'd better get used to it.

24:03.652 --> 24:06.863
Like I told you, there's no free lunch,

24:06.864 --> 24:10.075
no sirree, Bob, not in this lifetime.

24:10.076 --> 24:11.075
Uh-uh.

24:12.160 --> 24:16.998
Still, life must be better
here than on the streets, hmm?

24:18.291 --> 24:20.001
Here, the predators are few.

24:21.128 --> 24:24.381
The benefits are many, hmm?

24:24.382 --> 24:25.653
Hmm?

24:25.654 --> 24:26.924
Mmm.

24:26.925 --> 24:29.428
For I am a generous man.

24:31.221 --> 24:35.183
I am a man of my word.

24:41.189 --> 24:42.189
Now, then,

24:47.821 --> 24:49.823
why don't you go in there

24:51.908 --> 24:53.660
and freshen up for your uncle Billy?

24:55.912 --> 24:57.246
Go on now.

24:57.247 --> 24:58.457
Draw your bath.

24:58.458 --> 24:59.687
Skedaddle.

24:59.688 --> 25:00.916
Okay.

25:00.917 --> 25:02.563
Shoo, shoo.

25:02.564 --> 25:04.211
Shoo fly.

25:07.132 --> 25:09.176
(crying)

25:15.891 --> 25:16.891
Mmmm.

25:21.229 --> 25:22.229
Mmm.

25:24.649 --> 25:26.860
(gurgling)

25:30.113 --> 25:34.493
Would you like to come in
here and keep me company?

25:59.309 --> 26:01.520
(grunting)

26:16.993 --> 26:18.537
Lin Sue, Lin sue,

26:20.830 --> 26:22.832
you sweet young woman.

26:26.795 --> 26:28.379
I'll tell you,

26:28.380 --> 26:31.174
the one thing worse than the devil within

26:34.636 --> 26:35.637
is the devil without.

26:37.514 --> 26:40.224
(phone ringing)

26:40.225 --> 26:43.645
(eerie atmospheric music)

26:46.189 --> 26:47.274
[John] Save my seat.

26:51.528 --> 26:52.528
Hello.

26:54.322 --> 26:55.322
Yeah.

26:57.200 --> 27:02.163
What?

27:02.414 --> 27:03.247
[Mark] What?

27:03.248 --> 27:04.081
What is it?

27:04.082 --> 27:06.835
There's been another
accident at the laundry.

27:06.836 --> 27:08.712
A steam hose broke loose on that machine,

27:08.713 --> 27:09.920
burned three women.

27:09.921 --> 27:11.172
One of them is at the hospital.

27:11.173 --> 27:12.256
Shit.

27:12.257 --> 27:13.550
Hey, can I come with?

27:14.801 --> 27:18.388
(dramatic orchestral music)

27:27.439 --> 27:28.272
[John] Hey, Pascal,

27:28.273 --> 27:29.816
how you liking public service?

27:29.817 --> 27:31.776
[Pascal] Oh, you know.

27:32.986 --> 27:34.070
[John] Can you tell me what room

27:34.071 --> 27:35.155
Annette Gillian is in, please?

27:35.156 --> 27:36.323
[Woman] Room 132.

27:36.324 --> 27:37.323
Thank you.

27:40.619 --> 27:42.162
Annette, Annette!

27:42.163 --> 27:43.371
(crying)

27:43.372 --> 27:44.580
Remember me?

27:44.581 --> 27:45.414
I'm officer Hunton.

27:45.415 --> 27:46.811
Oh, I thought you were the doctor.

27:46.812 --> 27:48.209
Well, go get a goddamn doctor!

27:49.419 --> 27:50.419
Where is he?

27:51.588 --> 27:53.131
Where's the doctor?

27:54.382 --> 27:55.382
Oh, god!

27:56.635 --> 27:57.969
What took you so long?

27:57.970 --> 27:58.802
That's it.

27:58.803 --> 27:59.929
Take it easy, Annette.

27:59.930 --> 28:01.639
Take it easy.

28:01.640 --> 28:05.351
Annette, Annette, take it easy.

28:05.352 --> 28:07.354
This is going to take the pain away, huh?

28:08.271 --> 28:10.022
(crying)

28:10.023 --> 28:12.692
No pain allowed in this hospital.

28:16.363 --> 28:17.363
There.

28:19.741 --> 28:20.741
There we go.

28:24.037 --> 28:25.037
That's it.

28:29.834 --> 28:30.834
What do you want?

28:31.711 --> 28:32.670
I'm officer Hunton.

28:32.671 --> 28:34.756
I'm here to ask Annette
about the accident.

28:34.757 --> 28:36.340
I don't think she's up to it.

28:36.341 --> 28:38.093
I don't think I want a second opinion.

28:38.094 --> 28:40.929
Annette, what happened?

28:42.472 --> 28:43.807
We was running sheets,

28:45.183 --> 28:47.976
and the ironer just blew up.

28:47.977 --> 28:50.208
Mr. Stanner said there must have been

28:50.209 --> 28:52.440
a surge from the boiler or something.

28:52.441 --> 28:53.483
I don't know.

28:56.069 --> 28:58.279
Has anything like this
ever happened before?

29:00.407 --> 29:01.949
It all started happening

29:01.950 --> 29:05.328
when Sherry cut her hand
on one of the clamps.

29:05.329 --> 29:06.600
On the mangler?

29:06.601 --> 29:07.653
[Annette] Yeah.

29:07.654 --> 29:08.706
Was there blood?

29:08.707 --> 29:10.500
Well, I mean, did she
bleed on the mangler?

29:10.501 --> 29:12.961
There was blood everywhere,

29:14.879 --> 29:16.381
and then later

29:18.258 --> 29:19.675
Mrs. Frawley...

29:19.676 --> 29:20.719
I think she's had enough.

29:20.720 --> 29:21.845
She needs some rest.

29:23.054 --> 29:24.514
Annette, thank you very much.

29:26.808 --> 29:27.808
Sherry Ouelette

29:29.936 --> 29:31.541
Mr. Gartley's niece,

29:31.542 --> 29:33.148
just out of high school.

29:34.566 --> 29:38.528
Mr. Gartley watches her like a hawk,

29:38.529 --> 29:40.320
has all her life.

29:40.321 --> 29:42.115
Won't let her have any boyfriends

29:43.742 --> 29:45.410
or go on dates.

29:48.913 --> 29:52.541
You know, it's almost like that machine

29:52.542 --> 29:56.171
had tasted blood and found it liked it.

29:58.757 --> 30:01.760
Don't women get funny ideas sometimes?

30:03.052 --> 30:04.929
Thank you very much, Annette.

30:04.930 --> 30:05.929
You'll be fine.

30:06.723 --> 30:07.619
Bye-bye.

30:07.620 --> 30:08.567
Thanks.

30:08.568 --> 30:09.516
Come on.

30:10.852 --> 30:11.978
Annette, I just wanted to ask...

30:11.979 --> 30:13.021
Mark, come.

30:22.030 --> 30:23.740
Safety inspector barely had time

30:23.741 --> 30:24.698
to check the machine.

30:24.699 --> 30:27.494
They railroaded that inquest through.

30:27.495 --> 30:28.766
Said, "Everything's okay."

30:28.767 --> 30:30.037
"Put those kids back to work."

30:30.038 --> 30:33.958
And then, kapoom, three women burned,

30:33.959 --> 30:35.542
one kid's disfigured for life.

30:35.543 --> 30:37.420
Now, that's against the law in my book.

30:39.297 --> 30:41.716
So, what do you think?

30:41.717 --> 30:42.717
Mark?

30:42.718 --> 30:43.717
What?

30:43.718 --> 30:46.763
What's going on in that
jelly-roll head of yours?

30:46.764 --> 30:47.763
Nothing.

30:48.723 --> 30:49.765
Right.

30:49.766 --> 30:52.101
That would be a first.

30:52.102 --> 30:53.101
Barry!

30:54.604 --> 30:55.604
Barry!

31:02.529 --> 31:04.030
[Mark] Was that Mrs. Ellenshaw?

31:04.031 --> 31:05.156
[John] Yeah.

31:08.284 --> 31:10.370
[Mark] Take it easy, man.

31:10.371 --> 31:11.287
Right.

31:11.288 --> 31:12.204
You, too.

31:19.003 --> 31:20.003
Hey man,

31:22.090 --> 31:24.132
why don't you come on over?

31:24.133 --> 31:26.719
There's something important
I want to show you.

31:26.720 --> 31:27.971
[John] Six-pack of beer?

31:27.972 --> 31:29.137
No.

31:29.138 --> 31:29.972
Come on.

31:29.973 --> 31:30.806
Are you hungry?

31:30.807 --> 31:31.640
[John] No.

31:31.641 --> 31:32.475
I'm going to bed.

31:32.476 --> 31:33.308
Come on.

31:33.309 --> 31:34.143
It's really important.

31:34.144 --> 31:35.143
Come on.

31:36.145 --> 31:37.564
[John] Ah, what the fuck.

31:37.565 --> 31:38.397
Cold beer?

31:38.398 --> 31:39.731
Is that all I'm good for?

31:39.732 --> 31:41.233
You really know how to hurt a guy.

31:41.234 --> 31:43.277
That's no way to treat
your brother-in-law.

31:43.278 --> 31:45.154
I suppose you'd follow me
to the ends of the earth

31:45.155 --> 31:46.071
if I asked.

31:46.072 --> 31:46.905
[John] That's right, man.

31:46.906 --> 31:49.576
I'd follow you to the
ends of the earth, man.

31:52.453 --> 31:53.370
[Mark] Come.

31:53.371 --> 31:54.288
[John] What?

31:55.123 --> 31:57.292
Frazer's Golden Bough.

31:57.293 --> 31:58.083
Check it out.

31:58.084 --> 31:59.522
You might learn something.

31:59.523 --> 32:00.961
Frazer's Golden Bough,

32:00.962 --> 32:04.507
the definitive work on
magic and the occult.

32:04.508 --> 32:06.092
Check it out, check it out.

32:08.511 --> 32:10.366
Have you considered the possibility

32:10.367 --> 32:12.223
that the machine might be haunted?

32:14.392 --> 32:15.392
Oh, yeah.

32:16.436 --> 32:17.604
Oh, yes, Mark.

32:17.605 --> 32:18.437
Yes.

32:18.438 --> 32:20.189
That's the first thing
that popped into my mind.

32:20.190 --> 32:21.023
No.

32:21.024 --> 32:22.232
Play along with me.

32:22.233 --> 32:24.193
Maybe haunted is not a good word.

32:24.194 --> 32:25.403
Let's say possessed.

32:27.739 --> 32:28.906
Possessed.

32:28.907 --> 32:30.116
[Mark] Yeah.

32:30.117 --> 32:31.555
Yeah, man.

32:31.556 --> 32:32.993
Possessed.

32:32.994 --> 32:33.828
[John] Possessed?

32:33.829 --> 32:34.661
Yeah!

32:34.662 --> 32:35.662
Possessed.

32:36.372 --> 32:37.749
By the parrot demon, right?

32:37.750 --> 32:39.666
Okay, okay,

32:39.667 --> 32:40.959
I'll tell you what we're gonna do, Mark,

32:40.960 --> 32:42.920
we're gonna grab that
bad boy by the throat,

32:42.921 --> 32:44.881
shove a couple cloves
of garlic up his butt,

32:44.882 --> 32:46.257
and that'll be the end of it, right?

32:46.258 --> 32:47.592
Man, this stuff's for real.

32:47.593 --> 32:48.676
I'm serious about this.

32:48.677 --> 32:49.635
I mean, check it out.

32:49.636 --> 32:50.594
This stuff is for real.

32:50.595 --> 32:52.930
Look, if you just look in here,

32:52.931 --> 32:55.266
I mean, everything is pointing...

32:55.267 --> 32:58.102
Mark, check it out.

32:59.103 --> 33:01.021
First there is god,

33:01.022 --> 33:03.524
then there's country,
and then there's the law.

33:04.484 --> 33:05.901
All right?

33:05.902 --> 33:07.195
The rest is bullshit.

33:08.571 --> 33:09.571
Okay?

33:11.324 --> 33:12.659
This is bullshit, Mark.

33:13.785 --> 33:15.536
Reality, bullshit.

33:15.537 --> 33:17.288
Bullshit, reality.

33:18.873 --> 33:19.873
This is bullshit.

33:23.169 --> 33:25.004
(ominous atmospheric music)

33:25.005 --> 33:26.359
[Woman] Goodnight.

33:26.360 --> 33:28.351
[Man] Later.

33:28.352 --> 33:30.343
(steam hissing)

33:49.445 --> 33:52.573
(electricity zapping)

34:08.005 --> 34:10.717
(metal clanging)

34:17.764 --> 34:19.183
(metal screeching)

34:19.184 --> 34:20.141
(screaming)

34:20.143 --> 34:21.039
Help!

34:21.040 --> 34:21.935
Whoa!

34:21.936 --> 34:23.896
I got you, I got you.

34:23.897 --> 34:26.940
(screaming)

34:26.940 --> 34:28.400
It's okay, it's okay.

34:28.402 --> 34:29.860
Shh.

34:29.860 --> 34:31.570
It's all right, it's all right.

34:31.571 --> 34:33.384
You'll be okay, you'll be okay.

34:33.385 --> 34:35.197
Bring her up here, George.

34:35.199 --> 34:37.743
But, Mr. Gartley, she's hurt, sir.

34:37.744 --> 34:40.288
Mr. Gartley, she needs a doctor.

34:40.289 --> 34:41.246
She needs help.

34:41.246 --> 34:42.290
[Lin Sue] My finger!

34:43.666 --> 34:46.293
Bring her to me.

34:46.293 --> 34:48.107
[Mark] All spells can be reduced

34:48.108 --> 34:49.920
to simple common denominators.

34:49.922 --> 34:52.425
European spells mention the Hand of Glory,

34:52.426 --> 34:53.926
and that's real trouble.

34:53.927 --> 34:55.761
Look, spells need a catalyst

34:55.762 --> 34:57.367
Either herbal or human or both.

34:57.368 --> 34:58.973
The answer is in that book.

34:58.974 --> 34:59.995
Just go for it!

34:59.996 --> 35:00.923
[John] Uh-huh.

35:00.924 --> 35:01.850
Carry on.

35:01.851 --> 35:02.767
Come on, come on.

35:02.768 --> 35:03.685
Read on, man.

35:04.645 --> 35:07.565
Belladonna, Hand of Glory.

35:09.025 --> 35:10.213
Blood of a virgin!

35:10.214 --> 35:11.401
[Mark] Ha ha.

35:11.402 --> 35:12.527
Now, that's supernatural.

35:12.528 --> 35:15.782
Supernatural is a really
misleading word, man.

35:15.783 --> 35:19.202
Witches, demons, spirits,

35:19.203 --> 35:20.953
all part of nature.

35:20.954 --> 35:22.704
Like, um, okay,

35:22.705 --> 35:27.668
a demon is a kind of energy
like electricity or fire.

35:28.711 --> 35:31.923
Sometimes it gets out of
control, and people get hurt.

35:33.257 --> 35:34.967
Thought you might want something to eat.

35:35.885 --> 35:37.677
Thank you.

35:37.678 --> 35:41.224
The most powerful spells
always incorporate belladonna.

35:41.225 --> 35:42.390
[John] What is belladonna?

35:42.391 --> 35:44.602
[Mark] The Hand of Glory,
or deadly nightshade.

35:44.603 --> 35:45.498
The plant?

35:45.499 --> 35:46.394
Yeah.

35:46.395 --> 35:49.899
And the most common
ingredient in all these spells

35:49.900 --> 35:52.819
is, uh, the blood of a virgin.

35:56.364 --> 35:58.532
(laughing)

35:58.533 --> 36:01.410
You must admit the way
Annette describes Sherry,

36:01.411 --> 36:02.537
she sounds the type.

36:03.621 --> 36:05.455
(laughing)

36:05.456 --> 36:06.769
Oh, come on.

36:06.770 --> 36:08.083
Come on.

36:08.084 --> 36:08.917
Go with the flow.

36:08.918 --> 36:10.253
Think of the possibilities.

36:10.254 --> 36:11.253
Could be fun, huh?

36:12.171 --> 36:12.963
All right.

36:12.964 --> 36:15.069
Hey, Mark, tell you what.

36:15.070 --> 36:17.175
I'll run right on over

36:17.176 --> 36:19.095
to Sherry Ouelette's house, okay?

36:19.096 --> 36:19.971
Knock on the door.

36:19.972 --> 36:20.847
(imitating knocking)

36:20.848 --> 36:21.827
"Sherry?"

36:21.828 --> 36:22.806
"Hi."

36:22.807 --> 36:24.391
"My name is officer John Hunton."

36:24.392 --> 36:26.873
"I'm with the police department here,"

36:26.874 --> 36:29.177
"and I am investigating a laundry machine"

36:29.178 --> 36:31.482
"with a bad case of demon possession,"

36:31.483 --> 36:33.692
"and I need to examine you"

36:33.693 --> 36:35.945
"to determine whether
or not you're a virgin."

36:37.321 --> 36:38.321
Right?

36:40.199 --> 36:41.409
Mmm, mm-hmm.

36:41.410 --> 36:42.409
Huh?

36:44.620 --> 36:46.163
Mark, I could just see my report.

36:46.164 --> 36:47.706
They would tar and feather me

36:47.707 --> 36:49.917
and run me out of this town on a rail.

36:51.002 --> 36:52.002
You think so?

36:53.171 --> 36:54.004
(laughing)

36:54.005 --> 36:56.382
That sounds like a
whole lot of fun to me.

36:56.383 --> 36:57.404
Oh, yeah!

36:57.405 --> 36:58.425
Oh, boy!

36:58.426 --> 37:01.137
Why don't we just go
there and talk to her?

37:01.138 --> 37:02.221
Do it for me.

37:02.222 --> 37:03.889
Come on.

37:03.890 --> 37:05.098
[Molly] Johnny?

37:05.099 --> 37:07.101
Johnny, I got that info for you.

37:07.102 --> 37:08.498
Yeah, Molly, go ahead.

37:08.499 --> 37:09.801
[Molly] Let's see.

37:09.802 --> 37:11.104
Sherry Ouelette.

37:11.105 --> 37:14.567
Parents died in a car
accident on 7/10/83.

37:14.568 --> 37:17.153
William Gartley is her legal guardian.

37:17.154 --> 37:18.425
Is that it?

37:18.426 --> 37:19.696
[Molly] Yeah.

37:19.697 --> 37:22.491
Who's picking up the tab for my overtime?

37:22.492 --> 37:23.742
Take it out of my pension.

37:23.743 --> 37:24.993
You're the best, Molly.

37:24.994 --> 37:26.787
[Molly] You got that right.

37:26.788 --> 37:29.749
(eerie piano music)

37:47.350 --> 37:48.350
Oh, man.

37:49.477 --> 37:51.812
So who's going to pop the ques...

37:51.813 --> 37:53.648
You don't say a word.

37:53.649 --> 37:54.481
Right?

37:54.482 --> 37:55.482
Not a word.

38:00.238 --> 38:01.279
Far out.

38:01.280 --> 38:02.322
Gothic.

38:06.202 --> 38:08.746
(bell ringing)

38:11.499 --> 38:12.437
[Sherry] Who is it?

38:12.438 --> 38:13.376
[John] Sherry?

38:13.377 --> 38:14.209
Hi.

38:14.210 --> 38:16.250
It's officer John Hunton
from the police department.

38:18.839 --> 38:19.673
Hi.

38:19.674 --> 38:20.507
Hi.

38:20.508 --> 38:21.342
[John] Remember me?

38:21.343 --> 38:22.300
Mm-hmm.

38:22.301 --> 38:24.094
I'm here to ask you some questions

38:24.095 --> 38:25.721
about the accidents
that have been happening

38:25.722 --> 38:27.431
at the Blue Ribbon Laundry.

38:27.432 --> 38:29.141
Are you a policeman, too?

38:29.142 --> 38:30.392
[Mark] No.

38:30.393 --> 38:31.269
I'm a theoretical...

38:31.270 --> 38:32.894
(grunting)

38:32.895 --> 38:35.021
Um, this is Mark Jackson.

38:35.022 --> 38:37.149
He's a student, an observer.

38:39.193 --> 38:40.653
Then I guess it's all right.

38:42.571 --> 38:44.572
(door unlocking)

38:44.573 --> 38:46.073
[John] Thank you.

38:46.074 --> 38:47.575
It won't take long.

38:52.957 --> 38:54.000
Is your uncle here?

38:56.752 --> 38:57.752
I'm alone.

39:02.633 --> 39:04.385
Oh, hey, look at those.

39:04.386 --> 39:05.510
(laughing)

39:05.511 --> 39:06.971
They're beautiful.

39:08.014 --> 39:09.515
Look at that little face!

39:10.766 --> 39:11.766
Are they yours?

39:11.767 --> 39:13.935
No, they're not really mine.

39:13.936 --> 39:16.272
My uncle says they'll be mine someday.

39:16.273 --> 39:18.315
(clock chiming)

39:18.316 --> 39:19.524
Um, Sherry, I'm really sorry

39:19.525 --> 39:21.110
to disturb you at a time like this.

39:21.111 --> 39:22.403
I just have a few questions.

39:22.404 --> 39:23.800
Okay?

39:23.801 --> 39:25.196
Okay.

39:25.197 --> 39:26.240
[John] It's okay?

39:26.241 --> 39:27.407
Mm-hmm.

39:27.408 --> 39:28.700
All right.

39:28.701 --> 39:32.455
Now, Annette said that you
cut your hand on a clamp.

39:32.456 --> 39:33.789
How did that happen?

39:35.333 --> 39:37.418
Getting out of the way of that icebox.

39:37.419 --> 39:39.232
(dramatic orchestral music)

39:39.233 --> 39:41.046
These two guys lost control.

39:41.047 --> 39:45.259
I guess it, it hit the feed belt.

39:45.260 --> 39:46.302
On the mangler?

39:46.303 --> 39:47.344
Yeah.

39:47.345 --> 39:49.388
Then it bounced off and almost hit me.

39:51.349 --> 39:53.851
Did this icebox hit the safety bar?

39:53.852 --> 39:54.851
I think it did.

39:55.686 --> 39:57.855
There were bright sparks everywhere.

39:57.856 --> 39:58.688
What?

39:58.689 --> 39:59.898
Sparks like a wire had been cut?

39:59.899 --> 40:02.985
[Sherry] I saw a big flash
like lightning or something.

40:04.653 --> 40:05.799
That's it, then.

40:05.800 --> 40:07.395
There it is.

40:07.396 --> 40:08.991
(crying)

40:12.036 --> 40:13.913
I really loved Mrs. Frawley.

40:17.833 --> 40:18.666
Shh.

40:18.667 --> 40:21.420
She was like a mother to me.

40:21.421 --> 40:23.463
I tried to help her.

40:23.464 --> 40:24.840
I pulled as hard as I could,

40:24.841 --> 40:26.092
but I was too weak.

40:26.093 --> 40:26.925
Shh.

40:26.926 --> 40:27.759
It's okay.

40:27.760 --> 40:28.928
Sherry, Sherry.

40:28.929 --> 40:30.178
Sherry.

40:30.179 --> 40:32.431
Sherry, you're a very brave young woman.

40:32.432 --> 40:33.431
Okay?

40:34.225 --> 40:35.393
Sherry I just want...

40:35.394 --> 40:36.644
Mark!

40:38.020 --> 40:39.855
The icebox hit the safety bar.

40:39.856 --> 40:40.688
That's it.

40:40.689 --> 40:41.607
Thank you very much.

40:41.608 --> 40:42.690
Bye-bye.

40:42.691 --> 40:44.255
It was a short circuit.

40:44.256 --> 40:45.820
That's all there is to it.

40:45.821 --> 40:46.654
Let's go.

40:46.655 --> 40:47.487
Mark, Mark!

40:47.488 --> 40:48.572
Sherry, are you a virgin?

40:48.573 --> 40:49.948
Excuse me?

40:49.949 --> 40:51.304
What is this?

40:51.305 --> 40:52.660
Just get out!

40:53.702 --> 40:55.496
Just get the hell out!

40:57.415 --> 40:58.373
What did I tell you?

40:58.374 --> 40:59.875
What did I tell you?

40:59.876 --> 41:01.376
I'm right, I'm right.

41:01.377 --> 41:02.878
She's definitely a virgin.

41:02.879 --> 41:03.711
Jesus Christ!

41:03.712 --> 41:05.484
I can't believe you did that,

41:05.485 --> 41:07.258
talk to a little girl like that.

41:07.259 --> 41:08.091
God!

41:08.092 --> 41:08.925
Have fun?

41:08.926 --> 41:09.905
Shit, I hope you had fun.

41:09.906 --> 41:10.886
It's not a question of fun.

41:10.887 --> 41:11.803
I know I'm right.

41:11.804 --> 41:12.992
Shut up, goddamn it.

41:12.993 --> 41:14.180
What more do you want?

41:14.181 --> 41:16.475
No more about virgins, all right?

41:16.476 --> 41:17.308
[Mark] I'm right.

41:17.309 --> 41:19.373
What are you some kind of pervert?

41:19.374 --> 41:21.439
Doesn't matter whether I'm a pervert

41:21.440 --> 41:24.066
(siren wailing)

41:25.985 --> 41:26.985
What is this?

41:27.862 --> 41:28.695
Oh, Christ.

41:28.696 --> 41:31.323
[Mark] What the hell is
going on at Mrs. Smith's house?

41:31.324 --> 41:32.157
I don't know.

41:32.158 --> 41:34.318
Whatever it is, you stay the
hell out of it, all right?

41:36.662 --> 41:37.955
[Man] There he is, there he is!

41:37.956 --> 41:39.539
Stop him!

41:39.540 --> 41:41.708
Give me a hand.

41:41.709 --> 41:43.878
(dog barking)

41:44.837 --> 41:46.463
Mark, Mark!

41:46.464 --> 41:47.860
Stay in the car.

41:47.861 --> 41:49.257
All right.

41:50.009 --> 41:50.884
You stay in the car!

41:50.885 --> 41:52.427
[Mark] All right, all right!

41:52.428 --> 41:54.095
[Man] Suffocating to death here.

41:54.096 --> 41:55.764
Hey, Steele, what is this?

41:55.765 --> 41:56.598
Hi, Johnny.

41:56.599 --> 41:57.515
It's really bad.

41:57.516 --> 41:58.433
The boy suffocated.

41:59.894 --> 42:01.123
It's Barry Ellenshaw.

42:01.124 --> 42:02.353
Been missing all day.

42:02.354 --> 42:03.188
Mrs. Smith just learned 10 minutes ago.

42:03.189 --> 42:04.940
I found that icebox when
I got here this morning.

42:04.941 --> 42:05.773
Shh.

42:05.774 --> 42:06.608
It's all right.

42:06.609 --> 42:07.442
He such a smart kid.

42:07.443 --> 42:08.818
He never got in any trouble.

42:08.819 --> 42:11.030
He'd no more play in
a refrigerator than...

42:11.031 --> 42:12.071
All right.

42:12.072 --> 42:15.493
The boy's dog was
barking outside the icebox.

42:15.494 --> 42:17.828
That's why I had a look inside.

42:17.829 --> 42:18.661
Oh, Barry.

42:18.662 --> 42:19.996
(dog whimpering)

42:19.997 --> 42:22.624
Suffocated, poor kid.

42:22.625 --> 42:25.085
He's been missing since
11 o'clock this morning.

42:25.086 --> 42:26.170
[Man] Come on, honey.

42:27.838 --> 42:29.298
Rest in peace, Barry.

42:31.509 --> 42:33.531
[Woman] My baby.

42:33.532 --> 42:35.554
Barry Ellenshaw.

42:35.555 --> 42:36.930
Oh, man.

42:36.931 --> 42:38.306
Poor kid.

42:38.307 --> 42:40.371
(camera flashing)

42:40.372 --> 42:42.436
(birds fluttering)

42:46.315 --> 42:49.026
Hell of a shame, huh, Johnny?

42:52.696 --> 42:53.530
Get him out of here.

42:53.531 --> 42:54.990
[Officer] Stand back there.

42:54.991 --> 42:57.701
(dog whimpering)

42:59.620 --> 43:00.620
Stand back.

43:00.621 --> 43:03.832
(dramatic piano music)

43:04.959 --> 43:05.792
No, no!

43:05.793 --> 43:06.897
No, no, Maryanne, no!

43:06.898 --> 43:08.003
[Marryanne] Stop.

43:08.004 --> 43:08.837
Barry!

43:08.838 --> 43:09.671
Stop!

43:09.672 --> 43:11.819
Oh, my baby!

43:11.820 --> 43:13.968
(dog barking)

43:31.777 --> 43:32.610
[Man] No!

43:32.611 --> 43:34.154
[Maryanne] Barry!

43:38.534 --> 43:40.577
(crying)

43:40.578 --> 43:41.452
It's not my fault.

43:41.453 --> 43:44.914
I had nothing to do with it.

43:44.915 --> 43:46.542
It was here when I came home from work.

43:46.543 --> 43:47.667
What?

43:47.668 --> 43:48.502
It's not yours?

43:48.503 --> 43:49.335
No.

43:49.336 --> 43:50.169
I don't know where it came from.

43:50.170 --> 43:52.298
Hey, Johnny, come have a look at this.

43:53.966 --> 43:56.927
(eerie piano music)

44:10.608 --> 44:11.608
Wait a minute.

44:12.943 --> 44:13.776
What?

44:13.777 --> 44:16.822
This is the son of a bitch
that almost hit Sherry?

44:16.823 --> 44:18.240
After it hit the mangler.

44:19.158 --> 44:20.284
(metal thudding)

44:20.285 --> 44:22.244
(grunting)

44:22.245 --> 44:24.204
Transference.

44:25.831 --> 44:27.833
It's transference of evil.

44:29.251 --> 44:30.753
Oh, bullshit.

44:30.754 --> 44:31.753
Evil.

44:31.754 --> 44:32.754
Bullshit.

44:34.673 --> 44:35.673
Easy.

44:38.677 --> 44:39.677
[John] What?

44:40.554 --> 44:41.554
Shit.

44:42.556 --> 44:43.556
It's all right.

44:45.059 --> 44:46.393
It's all right, little baby.

44:49.897 --> 44:50.981
It's all right, baby.

44:50.982 --> 44:52.273
Come on.

44:52.274 --> 44:53.442
(metal thudding)

44:53.443 --> 44:54.630
(screaming)

44:54.631 --> 44:55.642
Oh, jeez!

44:55.643 --> 44:57.274
Let go!

44:57.275 --> 44:58.906
(screaming)

45:04.370 --> 45:05.204
[John] Are you all right?

45:05.205 --> 45:06.351
[Mark] Yeah.

45:06.352 --> 45:07.445
I think so.

45:07.446 --> 45:08.540
Oh, shit.

45:09.667 --> 45:10.876
Jesus H. Christ.

45:13.253 --> 45:14.755
A hammer, you got a hammer?

45:14.756 --> 45:16.465
It's in the garage.

45:18.342 --> 45:19.342
[John] Ow!

45:26.308 --> 45:27.935
Miserable piece of dogfuck!

45:27.936 --> 45:29.770
(hammer thudding)

45:29.771 --> 45:31.980
(grunting)

45:41.573 --> 45:44.368
(camera flashing)

45:46.036 --> 45:47.036
Goddamn you!

45:47.996 --> 45:49.415
(electricity zapping)

45:49.416 --> 45:51.667
(wind whooshing)

45:51.668 --> 45:53.919
(all screaming)

45:58.048 --> 45:59.633
Oh, oh, god.

45:59.634 --> 46:00.633
God!

46:02.761 --> 46:04.555
[Mark] Jesus Christ!

46:06.515 --> 46:07.682
[John] God!

46:07.683 --> 46:09.705
Lend not thy sight to idols

46:09.706 --> 46:11.729
nor make gods of thyself!

46:17.443 --> 46:20.571
(electricity zapping)

46:29.538 --> 46:30.538
Oh, oh.

46:32.875 --> 46:35.272
(breathing heavily)

46:35.273 --> 46:37.671
(camera flashing)

46:39.256 --> 46:40.299
Nice work, Johnny.

46:41.633 --> 46:43.760
I always knew you had it in you.

46:43.761 --> 46:45.721
Where did you learn to do magic tricks?

46:47.681 --> 46:51.769
That was the first ghost I have ever seen.

46:51.770 --> 46:53.478
Thank you, my boy.

46:53.479 --> 46:54.855
Just when you thought you'd seen it all,

46:54.856 --> 46:56.982
life bites you in the ass.

46:56.983 --> 46:58.524
(chomping teeth)

46:58.525 --> 47:00.110
See you later, Johnny.

47:01.403 --> 47:02.571
I'll be waiting for you.

47:09.828 --> 47:11.872
What the fuck was that?

47:12.873 --> 47:16.835
Jesus Christ.

47:32.476 --> 47:33.810
(metal thudding)

47:33.811 --> 47:35.729
Get that thing out of my sight!

47:35.730 --> 47:36.729
And burn it

47:39.441 --> 47:41.108
Then bury it.

47:41.109 --> 47:43.153
Drive a fucking stake through its heart.

47:49.159 --> 47:52.037
(tires screeching)

47:56.959 --> 47:59.064
[Mark] So, what do you think now?

47:59.065 --> 48:01.171
[John] Do you know any priests?

48:01.172 --> 48:02.005
[Mark] No, man.

48:02.006 --> 48:03.297
Do you?

48:03.298 --> 48:04.131
[John] No.

48:04.132 --> 48:05.300
I knew a rabbi one time.

48:06.468 --> 48:08.053
[Mark] They'd think we're nuts.

48:09.054 --> 48:10.763
We are nuts.

48:10.764 --> 48:11.807
It's our play, Johnny.

48:11.808 --> 48:12.808
It's up to us.

48:18.146 --> 48:20.106
Why don't we just get some dynamite

48:20.107 --> 48:22.067
and blow the shit out of the pig?

48:23.151 --> 48:25.361
Brute force isn't the answer, man.

48:25.362 --> 48:29.449
I mean, a demon may be trapped
in that piece of machinery.

48:29.450 --> 48:30.658
There's a chance it could get out,

48:30.659 --> 48:33.161
it would love to get out, love to kill.

48:33.162 --> 48:34.266
Oh, good.

48:34.267 --> 48:35.371
Good.

48:35.372 --> 48:36.372
Virgin blood.

48:36.373 --> 48:37.582
That's the key.

48:37.583 --> 48:38.729
It's got to be.

48:38.730 --> 48:39.876
The trouble is

48:39.877 --> 48:41.503
there's many different kinds of demons.

48:41.504 --> 48:43.380
I don't know what we're dealing with.

48:43.381 --> 48:45.257
It could be in the cycle of Bubastis,

48:45.258 --> 48:46.967
Pan, Dionysius.

48:48.927 --> 48:49.927
You following me?

48:50.888 --> 48:52.514
No, but go on.

48:55.934 --> 48:57.895
I have to isolate the exact cause.

49:00.397 --> 49:02.691
We have to make sure that
we use the right ritual

49:02.692 --> 49:04.171
because the rites of exorcism,

49:04.172 --> 49:05.651
I don't know if you understand,

49:05.652 --> 49:07.905
but the rites of exorcism,
that's really heavy stuff.

49:07.906 --> 49:10.699
That's like controlled nuclear fission.

49:10.700 --> 49:12.618
We make one mistake, that's it.

49:12.619 --> 49:13.451
We're dead.

49:13.452 --> 49:14.494
We're destroyed.

49:16.330 --> 49:20.709
If you ask me, this is just
an act of random possession.

49:21.585 --> 49:22.794
It's got to be.

49:24.338 --> 49:26.965
(dramatic piano music)

49:26.966 --> 49:28.258
Hey, Mark.

49:30.093 --> 49:31.428
I got to do some thinking.

49:35.933 --> 49:37.475
Oh, Johnny,

49:37.476 --> 49:39.748
listen, man, don't worry, okay?

49:39.749 --> 49:41.719
I'm with you 100%, man, okay?

49:41.720 --> 49:43.413
[John] All right, Mark.

49:43.414 --> 49:45.108
That's a relief, man.

49:45.109 --> 49:46.525
[Mark] 100%.

49:46.526 --> 49:47.611
That's real reassuring.

49:59.831 --> 50:04.044
Voodoo, belladonna, demonic possessions.

50:06.213 --> 50:08.005
Oh, I'm having fun.

50:08.006 --> 50:10.007
Hey, I'm with you, man.

50:10.008 --> 50:12.093
There are stranger
things in heaven and earth,

50:12.094 --> 50:15.555
John Hunton, than are dreamt
of in your philosophy.

50:15.556 --> 50:17.766
(laughing)

50:44.001 --> 50:49.006
Hey, Johnny, what do you know?

50:49.007 --> 50:50.381
Not much, Tyrone.

50:50.382 --> 50:52.217
Just going to the morgue.

50:54.469 --> 50:55.406
Whew.

50:55.407 --> 50:56.345
Not much.

51:25.250 --> 51:28.003
Barry, Barry, Barry,
it's been a hell of a day.

51:28.004 --> 51:29.254
Fix you up in the morning.

51:30.380 --> 51:32.507
(sighing)

51:36.887 --> 51:38.889
He's a brave kid, he put
up a hell of a fight,

51:38.890 --> 51:40.474
broke his arm in six places.

51:41.767 --> 51:43.167
[John] It was suffocation, right?

51:44.603 --> 51:45.603
Mr. Hunton,

51:46.688 --> 51:47.898
we've been expecting you.

51:48.857 --> 51:49.816
You've come to see Mrs. Frawley.

51:49.817 --> 51:51.317
Yep.

51:51.318 --> 51:53.736
She was a real challenge.

51:53.737 --> 51:55.905
I had practically nothing to go on.

51:55.906 --> 51:58.950
Hardly recognized the parts
the ones that came in.

51:58.951 --> 52:00.368
You look at her now.

52:02.537 --> 52:04.580
I think I did a pretty damn good job,

52:04.581 --> 52:08.001
considering the raw
materials I had to work with.

52:08.002 --> 52:09.543
Can you keep a secret?

52:09.544 --> 52:10.754
I had to fill up her body with...

52:10.755 --> 52:12.881
I hate secrets, okay?

52:12.882 --> 52:13.839
Okay, yeah.

52:13.840 --> 52:14.883
You need to be alone.

52:14.884 --> 52:15.716
Right, I do.

52:15.717 --> 52:17.072
You've come to do some thinking.

52:17.073 --> 52:18.427
Okay, I'll be in my office.

52:18.428 --> 52:20.429
Okay, I'll call you if I need anything.

52:20.430 --> 52:22.641
She's headed to the
cemetery in the morning.

52:22.642 --> 52:24.434
Until then, she's all yours.

52:24.435 --> 52:25.267
Great, thank you.

52:25.268 --> 52:27.019
Oh, her personal possessions.

52:27.020 --> 52:28.772
Oh, they're right here.

52:29.898 --> 52:30.731
Great.

52:30.732 --> 52:31.566
That's all they brought in.

52:31.567 --> 52:32.399
Thanks.

52:32.400 --> 52:33.317
Cherry tomato?

52:33.318 --> 52:34.423
No, thank you.

52:34.424 --> 52:35.393
Thank you.

52:35.394 --> 52:36.378
Bye-bye, now.

52:36.379 --> 52:37.363
[Man] Bye,

52:41.785 --> 52:42.785
Oh, Jesus.

52:44.371 --> 52:47.332
(breathing heavily)

53:19.573 --> 53:20.782
You won't mind, will you?

53:41.720 --> 53:44.181
Jesus, I got to get a life.

53:44.182 --> 53:45.640
(camera flashing)

53:45.641 --> 53:46.953
Boo.

53:46.954 --> 53:48.267
Got you.

53:49.561 --> 53:50.561
Very funny.

53:54.816 --> 53:59.029
She looks pretty good, don't she?

53:59.030 --> 53:59.904
Oh, yeah.

53:59.905 --> 54:01.280
She looks great.

54:01.281 --> 54:03.199
(camera flashing)

54:03.200 --> 54:05.118
(eerie piano music)

54:05.119 --> 54:06.265
Johnny.

54:06.266 --> 54:07.411
Johnny!

54:07.412 --> 54:08.663
You want to come downstairs?

54:08.664 --> 54:10.498
We'll finish off that gin game

54:10.499 --> 54:12.333
we started three years ago.

54:12.334 --> 54:14.793
I've still got a drop
of that Irish whiskey.

54:14.794 --> 54:18.632
You know, I get the feeling
you don't like me anymore.

54:18.633 --> 54:19.633
No.

54:20.800 --> 54:22.761
It's my job I don't like anymore.

54:25.388 --> 54:26.388
Oh.

54:27.098 --> 54:28.934
Well, it doesn't matter much anyway.

54:31.186 --> 54:32.312
You won't have to look at my ugly mug

54:32.313 --> 54:33.688
around here much longer.

54:36.900 --> 54:37.900
Why?

54:38.568 --> 54:41.279
Don't tell me you're moving
out of this hellhole.

54:41.280 --> 54:42.989
Oh, something like that.

54:42.990 --> 54:43.948
(laughing)

54:43.949 --> 54:46.326
The doc says I'm going fast.

54:47.577 --> 54:50.580
I'm being eaten up inside.

55:00.465 --> 55:02.592
(sighing)

55:06.972 --> 55:08.807
I'm sorry to hear that.

55:08.808 --> 55:10.016
Ah, don't be.

55:10.934 --> 55:12.519
We all have to go sometime.

55:15.939 --> 55:20.485
Johnny, you and I, we
share the same ghosts.

55:23.697 --> 55:26.491
To forgive is divine,

55:29.369 --> 55:31.246
especially if you can forgive yourself.

55:37.377 --> 55:40.463
Oh, did you get pictures of that icebox?

55:40.464 --> 55:41.922
Oh, yeah.

55:41.923 --> 55:43.842
Yeah, I'm off down to the darkroom now.

55:45.885 --> 55:46.802
What was that?

55:46.803 --> 55:48.388
[Photographer] What?

55:48.389 --> 55:49.743
That ghost.

55:49.744 --> 55:51.098
(laughing)

55:51.099 --> 55:53.727
[Photographer] We live
in strange times, Johnny,

55:53.728 --> 55:55.228
very strange times.

55:56.146 --> 55:58.857
I'll have the photos ready later tonight.

55:59.733 --> 56:01.358
Come on by.

56:01.359 --> 56:04.695
I'll be waiting for you.

56:04.696 --> 56:07.177
You know, I'm 50 points
up on you in that game.

56:07.178 --> 56:09.659
I've got an ace up my
sleeve I'm dying to play.

56:11.119 --> 56:12.453
You know where to find me.

56:12.454 --> 56:14.414
You're going to lose
to an old hack like me.

56:14.415 --> 56:18.043
(dramatic orchestral music)

57:26.277 --> 57:27.277
Shit.

57:29.739 --> 57:32.742
(clothes clattering)

57:33.993 --> 57:34.993
Fuck.

57:38.415 --> 57:41.876
(eerie atmospheric music)

57:59.561 --> 58:01.688
(sighing)

58:18.413 --> 58:20.373
(intense orchestral music)

58:20.374 --> 58:24.210
(electricity zapping)

58:24.211 --> 58:26.421
(grunting)

58:31.926 --> 58:34.220
(screaming)

58:39.350 --> 58:41.728
(gun firing)

58:47.609 --> 58:48.442
What are you doing?

58:48.443 --> 58:49.903
Where the hell is Gartley?

58:49.904 --> 58:51.112
He's out of town.

58:51.113 --> 58:52.342
[John] Yeah, right.

58:52.343 --> 58:53.625
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

58:53.626 --> 58:54.908
Come back here!

58:54.909 --> 58:56.555
(grunting)

58:56.556 --> 58:58.202
Hey, stop!

58:58.203 --> 58:59.621
Goddamn it, he's out of town.

59:04.417 --> 59:07.170
Get your hands off of
me, you lying sack of shit.

59:07.171 --> 59:09.380
You want to go downtown?

59:09.381 --> 59:10.380
Boys, boys!

59:11.674 --> 59:12.674
All right.

59:13.426 --> 59:14.426
Knock it off.

59:15.762 --> 59:17.638
Get out, George.

59:17.639 --> 59:18.848
I'll deal with you later.

59:19.724 --> 59:21.204
Come in, Mr. Hunton.

59:21.205 --> 59:22.685
I've been expecting you.

59:24.771 --> 59:27.357
So sorry I missed you earlier.

59:27.358 --> 59:28.607
(door closing)

59:28.608 --> 59:31.236
You know, Stanner tells me
you're quite the detective.

59:32.195 --> 59:36.074
A regular Sherlock
Holmes of the dead, hmm?

59:37.200 --> 59:39.076
Why don't you shut that thing down

59:39.077 --> 59:40.954
before somebody else gets hurt?

59:42.580 --> 59:44.624
What, am I going to have to shut you down?

59:45.625 --> 59:46.416
(clicking tongue)

59:46.417 --> 59:48.545
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

59:48.546 --> 59:49.628
Mmm.

59:49.629 --> 59:50.922
Bad career move.

59:55.134 --> 59:57.136
Are you threatening me?

59:57.137 --> 59:58.471
Is that a threat?

59:59.764 --> 01:00:00.597
Go on, threaten me.

01:00:00.598 --> 01:00:02.225
I'll shove them crutches
up your moldy ass,

01:00:02.226 --> 01:00:03.226
you fucking clown.

01:00:06.104 --> 01:00:08.314
(laughing)

01:00:10.024 --> 01:00:11.233
I like that.

01:00:11.234 --> 01:00:12.359
Threaten?

01:00:12.360 --> 01:00:13.485
Uh-huh.

01:00:13.486 --> 01:00:14.444
No, no, no.

01:00:14.445 --> 01:00:18.740
Threaten is far too kind a word.

01:00:18.741 --> 01:00:21.536
This goddamn machine tried to kill me!

01:00:21.537 --> 01:00:23.746
(grunting)

01:00:24.622 --> 01:00:27.667
Breaking and entering is
a serious crime, officer.

01:00:28.751 --> 01:00:30.795
Perhaps I should have you arrested, hmm?

01:00:30.796 --> 01:00:31.754
Yeah, okay, okay.

01:00:31.755 --> 01:00:32.588
Hey, yeah.

01:00:32.589 --> 01:00:33.589
Have me arrested.

01:00:33.590 --> 01:00:36.301
I'm going to shut you down,
you sick son of a bitch.

01:00:38.386 --> 01:00:40.597
(growling)

01:00:42.348 --> 01:00:46.019
I will not have you
tamper with my affairs.

01:00:46.020 --> 01:00:47.436
I'll have you suspended!

01:00:47.437 --> 01:00:50.231
Hey, all your powerful
friends and all your money

01:00:50.232 --> 01:00:52.775
don't mean shit to me, Gartley.

01:00:52.776 --> 01:00:54.109
(laughing)

01:00:54.110 --> 01:00:57.196
My power has nothing to do with money.

01:00:58.281 --> 01:01:00.032
Power is energy.

01:01:00.033 --> 01:01:01.783
Power is motivation.

01:01:01.784 --> 01:01:03.536
Power is what holds things together

01:01:04.704 --> 01:01:06.372
when they would rather fly apart.

01:01:07.915 --> 01:01:10.835
It's a complex world out there, sporty.

01:01:11.711 --> 01:01:13.630
Many things you do not understand.

01:01:14.714 --> 01:01:18.176
But understand this.

01:01:19.427 --> 01:01:21.554
There's a little bit of me in that machine

01:01:21.555 --> 01:01:25.058
and a little bit of it in me.

01:01:25.933 --> 01:01:28.936
We are the lifeblood of this town.

01:01:32.899 --> 01:01:34.734
Gartley, what are you talking about?

01:01:37.028 --> 01:01:39.822
We all have to make sacrifices.

01:01:44.744 --> 01:01:45.744
You're right.

01:01:47.288 --> 01:01:48.498
Everything has its price.

01:01:50.083 --> 01:01:51.541
Yeah.

01:01:51.542 --> 01:01:53.001
Yes, it does.

01:01:53.002 --> 01:01:54.795
Well, do come again.

01:01:54.796 --> 01:01:56.172
This has been delightful.

01:01:58.549 --> 01:02:01.969
And, uh drive carefully, won't you?

01:02:06.099 --> 01:02:07.558
(intense orchestral music)

01:02:07.559 --> 01:02:08.558
Fuck you!

01:02:13.523 --> 01:02:14.523
What?

01:02:18.361 --> 01:02:20.988
(steam hissing)

01:02:59.777 --> 01:03:01.194
That S.O.B.

01:03:01.195 --> 01:03:03.573
He thinks he's going to
shut down our machine.

01:03:03.574 --> 01:03:05.240
(laughing)

01:03:05.241 --> 01:03:07.576
Well, sir, I've been thinking

01:03:07.577 --> 01:03:09.912
maybe it should be shut down.

01:03:12.665 --> 01:03:16.252
Yeah, how long you worked here, George?

01:03:18.463 --> 01:03:22.215
15 years.

01:03:22.216 --> 01:03:25.428
Well, you're practically
part of our little family,

01:03:25.429 --> 01:03:26.512
then, aren't you, hmm?

01:03:27.472 --> 01:03:30.850
I assume you'll be helping
us run this town, hmm?

01:03:33.644 --> 01:03:37.315
I've known that machine
since I was a little boy.

01:03:38.232 --> 01:03:39.233
My daddy bought it.

01:03:40.610 --> 01:03:43.112
Best business decision he
ever made, I'll tell you.

01:03:44.113 --> 01:03:47.115
My god, Mr. Gartley, sir.

01:03:47.116 --> 01:03:50.203
That that machine killed your daughter.

01:03:52.371 --> 01:03:53.706
Look what it's done to you.

01:03:56.709 --> 01:03:57.542
Yeah.

01:03:57.543 --> 01:03:59.086
Sacrifices, George.

01:04:00.171 --> 01:04:02.089
We all have to make them.

01:04:02.090 --> 01:04:03.340
Hell, boy.

01:04:03.341 --> 01:04:06.052
You could say that machine
out there made me what I am.

01:04:07.136 --> 01:04:08.971
Mr. Gartley, if you're
not going to deal with it,

01:04:08.972 --> 01:04:13.059
then maybe I should.

01:04:14.227 --> 01:04:16.771
Oh, don't be a fool, George.

01:04:18.147 --> 01:04:20.316
Don't throw away a bright future here.

01:04:22.693 --> 01:04:23.693
I'm worried.

01:04:24.529 --> 01:04:28.115
Worried, uh, it's been troubling me.

01:04:29.951 --> 01:04:34.413
Well, George, let your own
conscience be your guide.

01:04:52.265 --> 01:04:55.226
(eerie piano music)

01:05:03.025 --> 01:05:05.736
(phone clicking)

01:05:12.326 --> 01:05:13.953
Good evening, Martha.

01:05:13.954 --> 01:05:15.078
Bill.

01:05:15.079 --> 01:05:16.162
Bill Gartley.

01:05:16.163 --> 01:05:17.956
Sorry to call so late.

01:05:17.957 --> 01:05:20.668
Let me speak to the good
sheriff, won't you, Martha?

01:05:22.169 --> 01:05:23.169
Thank you.

01:05:24.380 --> 01:05:25.506
Evening, Hughes.

01:05:25.507 --> 01:05:26.506
Now listen,

01:05:26.507 --> 01:05:29.343
I'm having a little problem
with one of the boys.

01:05:29.344 --> 01:05:30.176
Yeah.

01:05:30.177 --> 01:05:31.721
That's the fellow.

01:05:31.722 --> 01:05:32.679
That's right.

01:05:32.680 --> 01:05:34.473
Now you deal with him.

01:05:35.933 --> 01:05:37.476
Okay, nighty-night.

01:05:40.771 --> 01:05:42.188
Fuck him.

01:05:42.189 --> 01:05:43.189
[Hughes] John?

01:05:45.484 --> 01:05:46.735
What?

01:05:46.736 --> 01:05:48.362
[Hughes] Take some time off.

01:05:48.363 --> 01:05:49.989
There's no case here, son.

01:05:49.990 --> 01:05:51.761
Take a vacation!

01:05:51.762 --> 01:05:53.534
Okay, Mr. Gartley.

01:05:54.577 --> 01:05:57.663
[Hughes] Now you're
suspended, officer Hunton.

01:05:57.664 --> 01:06:00.333
Hey, how much is he paying you, Hughes?

01:06:00.334 --> 01:06:01.313
[Hughes] Okay, pal.

01:06:01.314 --> 01:06:02.292
You're terminated!

01:06:02.293 --> 01:06:04.545
And kiss that pension good-bye.

01:06:04.546 --> 01:06:07.506
(eerie piano music)

01:06:11.218 --> 01:06:13.346
(panting)

01:06:21.520 --> 01:06:24.482
(breathing heavily)

01:06:30.947 --> 01:06:33.449
How are we feeling, my dear, hmm?

01:06:33.450 --> 01:06:34.449
Strange.

01:06:35.326 --> 01:06:36.452
I'm getting sick.

01:06:42.500 --> 01:06:43.751
Are you ready for bed?

01:06:44.794 --> 01:06:47.838
(Bill wheezing)

01:06:47.839 --> 01:06:49.130
Yes.

01:06:49.131 --> 01:06:50.423
No!

01:06:51.092 --> 01:06:52.092
No.

01:06:54.637 --> 01:06:56.347
There's something I must show you.

01:06:57.932 --> 01:06:58.932
Come.

01:07:00.184 --> 01:07:02.395
(grunting)

01:07:03.312 --> 01:07:04.792
(eerie piano music)

01:07:04.793 --> 01:07:06.273
Must be here somewhere.

01:07:08.359 --> 01:07:09.359
A-ha, yeah.

01:07:17.243 --> 01:07:19.412
My baby daughter's death certificate.

01:07:20.579 --> 01:07:21.580
Her passport to hell.

01:07:22.957 --> 01:07:24.959
She was only 16.

01:07:24.960 --> 01:07:25.917
Hmm.

01:07:25.918 --> 01:07:29.213
Well, survival of the
fittest is the way of things.

01:07:31.048 --> 01:07:33.466
I mean, surely, my child,

01:07:33.467 --> 01:07:35.636
you must have noticed how Riker's valley

01:07:35.637 --> 01:07:37.930
is so ideally perfect, hmm?

01:07:39.056 --> 01:07:40.307
There's something I want to show you.

01:07:40.308 --> 01:07:41.307
Just a moment here.

01:07:45.855 --> 01:07:46.855
Ah!

01:07:55.114 --> 01:07:59.263
This is my contract,

01:07:59.264 --> 01:08:03.414
my deal With The Beast,

01:08:03.581 --> 01:08:04.790
the beast in the machine.

01:08:10.463 --> 01:08:12.381
What's happening to me?

01:08:12.382 --> 01:08:13.381
My child,

01:08:14.967 --> 01:08:18.011
there's a little piece
of you in the mangler

01:08:19.013 --> 01:08:21.682
and the essence of it in you.

01:08:24.018 --> 01:08:25.728
You're one of us now.

01:08:28.606 --> 01:08:29.606
My signature.

01:08:30.899 --> 01:08:32.087
See?

01:08:32.089 --> 01:08:33.183
Hmm?

01:08:33.184 --> 01:08:34.277
Oh.

01:08:34.278 --> 01:08:36.029
Understand now?

01:08:36.031 --> 01:08:37.029
Do we?

01:08:39.033 --> 01:08:40.033
Hmm?

01:08:41.911 --> 01:08:42.911
See?

01:08:48.292 --> 01:08:49.960
Welcome to the club.

01:08:52.462 --> 01:08:53.506
Oh, precious.

01:09:20.950 --> 01:09:21.950
[John] Fuck!

01:09:22.660 --> 01:09:23.993
I've been studying, man.

01:09:23.995 --> 01:09:24.953
Virgin's blood.

01:09:24.953 --> 01:09:26.162
Definitely virgin's blood.

01:09:26.163 --> 01:09:27.747
It's got to be.

01:09:27.749 --> 01:09:28.957
Now, look.

01:09:28.957 --> 01:09:33.379
A little holy water,
a smidgen of Eucharist

01:09:33.380 --> 01:09:34.837
That ought to do it.

01:09:34.839 --> 01:09:36.464
We'll read some Leviticus.

01:09:36.465 --> 01:09:38.154
Strictly Christian white magic.

01:09:38.154 --> 01:09:39.843
Listen, I'll tell you the truth.

01:09:39.844 --> 01:09:43.346
I was really worried about
that Hand of Glory, belladonna.

01:09:43.348 --> 01:09:44.473
That's black juju.

01:09:44.474 --> 01:09:45.765
Strong magic.

01:09:45.767 --> 01:09:47.058
Hey, Mark?

01:09:47.059 --> 01:09:49.185
I looked down this son
of a bitch's throat.

01:09:50.270 --> 01:09:52.439
Holy water ain't gonna do it.

01:09:52.439 --> 01:09:54.607
Yeah, well, a demon conjured up

01:09:54.608 --> 01:09:57.068
in conjunction with the Hand of Glory can,

01:09:57.069 --> 01:10:01.198
I mean, that could eat a
stack of bibles for breakfast,

01:10:01.199 --> 01:10:04.493
but we don't have to worry about that.

01:10:04.494 --> 01:10:05.493
Thank god.

01:10:06.203 --> 01:10:07.662
All right.

01:10:07.663 --> 01:10:09.707
You know, I hope you're right.

01:10:09.708 --> 01:10:11.375
I know I'm right.

01:10:11.376 --> 01:10:12.375
I don't.

01:10:14.837 --> 01:10:16.964
We got to go talk to somebody.

01:10:16.965 --> 01:10:17.881
Come on.

01:10:17.882 --> 01:10:18.798
Hold up!

01:10:20.050 --> 01:10:22.072
Damn it, hold up!

01:10:22.073 --> 01:10:24.096
(steam hissing)

01:10:46.577 --> 01:10:48.328
I don't know about this, George.

01:10:48.329 --> 01:10:50.080
What the hell took you so long?

01:10:51.332 --> 01:10:52.332
I'm sorry.

01:10:53.792 --> 01:10:55.628
Are you sure we're doing the right thing?

01:10:55.629 --> 01:10:56.461
Yeah.

01:10:56.462 --> 01:10:57.670
Now, don't start arguing with me now.

01:10:57.671 --> 01:10:59.715
Go over there, cut all
power, and pull the breakers.

01:10:59.716 --> 01:11:01.258
I'll start on the feeder.

01:11:13.187 --> 01:11:16.315
(electricity zapping)

01:11:22.238 --> 01:11:23.154
Sherry?

01:11:23.155 --> 01:11:24.635
What are you doing here?

01:11:24.636 --> 01:11:25.897
I have to see my uncle.

01:11:25.898 --> 01:11:27.159
That's not a good idea.

01:11:27.160 --> 01:11:28.326
He's very upset.

01:11:28.327 --> 01:11:30.703
I can't work here anymore.

01:11:30.704 --> 01:11:32.081
The police came and asked me questions.

01:11:32.082 --> 01:11:33.999
I gotta speak to him.

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:35.166
Police.

01:11:35.167 --> 01:11:36.167
That figures.

01:11:37.503 --> 01:11:39.338
Just don't go up there.

01:11:39.339 --> 01:11:40.964
He's busy.

01:11:40.965 --> 01:11:42.549
Lin Sue's with him, isn't she?

01:11:44.093 --> 01:11:46.428
Sherry, go on home now.

01:11:47.930 --> 01:11:49.348
I have to talk to him.

01:11:53.018 --> 01:11:53.998
(metal thudding)

01:11:53.999 --> 01:11:54.968
Oh, oh, oh.

01:11:54.969 --> 01:11:55.974
I'm caught!

01:11:55.975 --> 01:11:57.082
Mr. Stanner!

01:11:57.083 --> 01:11:58.074
I'm caught!

01:11:58.075 --> 01:11:59.216
Help me!

01:11:59.217 --> 01:12:00.358
Aah!

01:12:00.359 --> 01:12:02.820
[Sherry] Mr. Stanner!

01:12:02.821 --> 01:12:04.217
The fuses!

01:12:04.218 --> 01:12:05.613
Jesus!

01:12:05.614 --> 01:12:07.908
(screaming)

01:12:09.618 --> 01:12:13.998
(electricity zapping)
(screaming)

01:12:13.999 --> 01:12:15.499
Turn it off!

01:12:15.500 --> 01:12:17.000
Oh, God, oh God!

01:12:17.001 --> 01:12:20.087
(electricity zapping)

01:12:23.090 --> 01:12:23.923
Turn it off!

01:12:23.924 --> 01:12:24.757
Mr. Gartley!

01:12:24.758 --> 01:12:26.135
Aah, oh, help me!

01:12:27.761 --> 01:12:28.824
Help me!

01:12:28.825 --> 01:12:29.773
Oh, please!

01:12:29.774 --> 01:12:30.722
Please!

01:12:30.723 --> 01:12:31.952
Do something!

01:12:31.953 --> 01:12:33.339
Do something?

01:12:33.340 --> 01:12:34.726
Do something?

01:12:34.727 --> 01:12:35.852
I'll do something.

01:12:35.853 --> 01:12:37.645
I'll dance, that's what I'll do.

01:12:37.646 --> 01:12:40.441
I'll do a little dance for you, Sherry.

01:12:40.442 --> 01:12:41.692
Oh, god.

01:12:41.693 --> 01:12:42.734
Mr. Gartley!

01:12:42.735 --> 01:12:44.653
A little jig.

01:12:44.654 --> 01:12:46.571
(laughing)

01:12:46.572 --> 01:12:48.948
I need your help now.

01:12:48.949 --> 01:12:51.368
We're running out of time.

01:12:51.369 --> 01:12:52.368
Come on.

01:12:57.541 --> 01:12:58.354
Please!

01:12:58.355 --> 01:12:59.449
Please!

01:12:59.450 --> 01:13:00.543
Aah!

01:13:00.544 --> 01:13:01.836
Uncle Bill, please!

01:13:01.837 --> 01:13:03.464
Move like there's no tomorrow.

01:13:03.465 --> 01:13:04.965
We're on the clock.

01:13:05.966 --> 01:13:07.071
(screaming)

01:13:07.072 --> 01:13:08.177
Do it, do it!

01:13:09.094 --> 01:13:10.428
I can't!

01:13:10.429 --> 01:13:11.783
Do it, do it!

01:13:11.784 --> 01:13:13.139
Do it now!

01:13:15.392 --> 01:13:16.267
Oh, Christ.

01:13:16.268 --> 01:13:17.519
I can't, George.

01:13:17.520 --> 01:13:18.519
Do it!

01:13:19.480 --> 01:13:21.106
Do it, do it, do it!

01:13:22.274 --> 01:13:23.316
Christ!

01:13:23.317 --> 01:13:25.297
Do it, do it!

01:13:25.298 --> 01:13:27.279
(screaming)

01:13:35.746 --> 01:13:37.623
Come here, child.

01:13:37.624 --> 01:13:38.623
Come here.

01:13:40.959 --> 01:13:43.462
Come here to your uncle bill.

01:13:43.463 --> 01:13:44.671
Sherry, Sherry!

01:13:46.632 --> 01:13:48.549
(crying)

01:13:48.550 --> 01:13:52.179
(dramatic orchestral music)

01:13:55.724 --> 01:13:59.520
I used to have all the time in the world.

01:14:06.944 --> 01:14:08.487
Damn her, damn her.

01:14:17.121 --> 01:14:19.164
(crying)

01:14:38.392 --> 01:14:39.225
Hey, hey.

01:14:39.226 --> 01:14:41.102
Hey, man, where the hell we going?

01:14:41.103 --> 01:14:42.980
We're gonna go talk to an old man.

01:14:49.194 --> 01:14:50.736
Oh, no.

01:14:50.737 --> 01:14:51.822
What the hell was this?

01:15:06.587 --> 01:15:08.046
(breathing heavily)

01:15:08.047 --> 01:15:09.506
[Photographer] No.

01:15:09.507 --> 01:15:10.340
Take me back.

01:15:10.341 --> 01:15:11.174
Johnny.

01:15:11.175 --> 01:15:12.154
[John] Stop!

01:15:12.155 --> 01:15:13.144
Don't argue.

01:15:13.145 --> 01:15:14.135
Just do it.

01:15:21.351 --> 01:15:24.229
I was just drinking my tea, and...

01:15:25.731 --> 01:15:27.941
(coughing)

01:15:30.277 --> 01:15:32.778
Hey, you'll be okay.

01:15:32.779 --> 01:15:34.072
You're gonna be all right.

01:15:35.365 --> 01:15:36.575
You'll be okay.

01:15:38.785 --> 01:15:41.413
Thanks for coming and
visiting me, Johnny.

01:15:42.789 --> 01:15:45.042
You made an old man very happy.

01:15:48.962 --> 01:15:51.297
(gasping)

01:15:51.298 --> 01:15:52.214
Just breathe.

01:15:52.215 --> 01:15:53.132
Just breathe.

01:15:57.721 --> 01:16:00.974
Downstairs in my office.

01:16:02.768 --> 01:16:03.894
Present for you.

01:16:06.230 --> 01:16:08.607
You have to exorcize your demon.

01:16:12.236 --> 01:16:14.029
Don't let it possess your soul.

01:16:19.826 --> 01:16:22.371
(gasping)

01:16:22.372 --> 01:16:27.334
Oh.

01:16:28.252 --> 01:16:30.462
(coughing)

01:16:32.798 --> 01:16:35.716
(gasping)

01:16:35.717 --> 01:16:39.346
(dramatic orchestral music)

01:16:49.523 --> 01:16:50.523
Shit!

01:17:44.828 --> 01:17:47.998
(tea kettle whistling)

01:18:02.804 --> 01:18:03.930
[Mark] Jeez.

01:18:22.532 --> 01:18:24.660
(sighing)

01:18:42.052 --> 01:18:43.052
Oh, man.

01:18:48.975 --> 01:18:50.102
It wasn't your fault.

01:18:52.562 --> 01:18:54.459
I was driving the car.

01:18:54.460 --> 01:18:56.357
Accidents happen.

01:18:56.358 --> 01:18:58.777
People make mistakes, but they carry on.

01:19:21.049 --> 01:19:22.049
Johnny.

01:19:24.553 --> 01:19:25.929
Take a look at this.

01:19:28.598 --> 01:19:29.599
This is my present.

01:19:31.435 --> 01:19:35.063
(dramatic orchestral music)

01:19:45.699 --> 01:19:47.930
"Maryanne Gartley, daughter
of William Gartley,"

01:19:47.931 --> 01:19:50.276
"was killed at the Blue
Ribbon Laundry yesterday"

01:19:50.277 --> 01:19:52.622
"when she apparently fell
into the new speed ironer."

01:19:52.623 --> 01:19:54.269
"She died on her birthday."

01:19:54.270 --> 01:19:55.917
"She was 16 years old."

01:19:58.962 --> 01:19:59.962
There's Maryanne.

01:20:03.675 --> 01:20:06.469
"Sarah Krandel was
reported missing yesterday"

01:20:06.470 --> 01:20:09.306
"when she failed to show up
at her 16th birthday party."

01:20:11.099 --> 01:20:12.099
That's Sarah.

01:20:13.852 --> 01:20:15.436
"Suzanne Bishop still missing."

01:20:15.437 --> 01:20:17.564
"Suzanne Bishop, daughter of Judge Bishop,"

01:20:17.565 --> 01:20:19.815
"was reported missing yesterday."

01:20:19.816 --> 01:20:22.444
"She was last seen at
her 16th birthday party."

01:20:27.157 --> 01:20:29.117
"Lois Hughes, Chatterton"

01:20:32.287 --> 01:20:34.539
Well, these are all the rich people,

01:20:34.540 --> 01:20:35.539
the old money,

01:20:38.043 --> 01:20:40.962
The people who want
nothing, need nothing more.

01:20:43.757 --> 01:20:45.008
Power, power.

01:20:47.511 --> 01:20:48.553
What is this?

01:20:51.181 --> 01:20:52.307
Wait a minute.

01:20:54.100 --> 01:20:54.935
Everything has its price.

01:20:54.936 --> 01:20:55.935
The price of power

01:20:56.812 --> 01:20:58.522
Gartley said something about...

01:21:00.190 --> 01:21:01.233
No, Gartley said

01:21:02.400 --> 01:21:04.194
that we all have to make sacrifices.

01:21:06.238 --> 01:21:07.781
Human sacrifices.

01:21:09.616 --> 01:21:10.616
Sherry?

01:21:13.161 --> 01:21:14.204
Jesus Christ.

01:21:25.048 --> 01:21:27.676
(phone ringing)

01:21:33.098 --> 01:21:34.348
Hi, Sherry?

01:21:34.349 --> 01:21:36.079
This is officer Hunton.

01:21:36.080 --> 01:21:37.811
Mr. Stanner's dead.

01:21:41.314 --> 01:21:43.024
I just went to see my uncle.

01:21:43.025 --> 01:21:44.525
(crying)

01:21:44.526 --> 01:21:45.819
Um, listen, Sherry.

01:21:46.862 --> 01:21:48.320
I want you to stay inside.

01:21:48.321 --> 01:21:50.115
I want you to stay in the house.

01:21:50.116 --> 01:21:50.949
Lock the doors.

01:21:50.950 --> 01:21:51.782
Stay in the house.

01:21:51.783 --> 01:21:53.703
You'll be safe as long as you stay in the house.

01:21:54.578 --> 01:21:55.578
What's going on?

01:21:57.455 --> 01:21:58.290
How old are you, Sherry?

01:21:58.291 --> 01:21:59.290
16?

01:22:01.793 --> 01:22:03.252
Really?

01:22:03.253 --> 01:22:04.712
Okay, stay inside.

01:22:04.713 --> 01:22:06.213
Do what I told you, okay?

01:22:06.214 --> 01:22:08.278
I'll explain everything when I get there.

01:22:08.279 --> 01:22:10.343
I'll be there as soon as I can, okay?

01:22:12.053 --> 01:22:14.805
(crying)

01:22:14.806 --> 01:22:16.975
The mangler got the foreman.

01:22:16.976 --> 01:22:18.226
Today's her birthday.

01:22:18.227 --> 01:22:19.227
She's 16.

01:22:20.353 --> 01:22:21.353
It's her birthday?

01:22:23.064 --> 01:22:24.316
We're running out of time.

01:22:37.370 --> 01:22:40.081
(Sherry gasping)

01:22:41.750 --> 01:22:43.168
Happy birthday, my child.

01:22:44.628 --> 01:22:46.880
Surprised to see your Uncle Bill?

01:22:46.881 --> 01:22:48.089
[Sherry] What do you want?

01:22:48.090 --> 01:22:49.299
Why, you, of course.

01:22:51.718 --> 01:22:52.969
[Sherry] Leave me alone.

01:22:55.472 --> 01:22:56.472
Oh.

01:22:57.766 --> 01:22:59.935
Aren't you going to blow out your candles?

01:23:02.437 --> 01:23:03.938
Come on.

01:23:03.939 --> 01:23:05.899
Go ahead, Sherry.

01:23:05.900 --> 01:23:07.192
Make a wish.

01:23:08.318 --> 01:23:09.778
I wish you were dead.

01:23:09.779 --> 01:23:10.611
(laughing)

01:23:10.612 --> 01:23:11.612
No doubt about it,

01:23:11.613 --> 01:23:14.157
girl's got true Gartley spirit.

01:23:14.158 --> 01:23:16.305
(bat thudding)
(grunting)

01:23:16.306 --> 01:23:18.453
(ominous atmospheric music)

01:23:18.454 --> 01:23:19.663
Oh, what a waste,

01:23:20.580 --> 01:23:21.580
but then,

01:23:22.540 --> 01:23:26.169
we all have to make sacrifices.

01:23:26.170 --> 01:23:29.130
(laughing)

01:23:29.131 --> 01:23:31.716
Now, now, now.

01:23:31.717 --> 01:23:34.302
(grunting)

01:23:35.679 --> 01:23:38.555
(spitting)

01:23:38.556 --> 01:23:39.723
[Sherry] Uh, no!

01:23:39.724 --> 01:23:42.435
Oh, I'm so sorry it had to be you,

01:23:42.436 --> 01:23:44.604
but I must not be selfish

01:23:44.605 --> 01:23:46.772
when I make my decision,

01:23:46.773 --> 01:23:50.735
so it's time to turn in your dance card.

01:23:50.736 --> 01:23:52.027
(laughing)

01:23:52.028 --> 01:23:54.884
I do hope you'll accept my apology,

01:23:54.885 --> 01:23:57.742
but I must choose between you and me,

01:23:59.119 --> 01:24:03.248
and of course, I choose me.

01:24:03.249 --> 01:24:06.209
(eerie piano music)

01:24:13.842 --> 01:24:14.926
Come, darling.

01:24:15.927 --> 01:24:20.890
We're running out of time.

01:24:21.349 --> 01:24:22.392
Stop, stop!

01:24:23.518 --> 01:24:25.123
We haven't got time, Mark.

01:24:25.124 --> 01:24:26.385
[Mark] I have to rehearse.

01:24:26.386 --> 01:24:27.579
We haven't got time!

01:24:27.580 --> 01:24:28.773
I have to rehearse.

01:24:30.233 --> 01:24:31.108
All right, fuck!

01:24:31.109 --> 01:24:32.860
Okay, I'm gonna read.

01:24:32.861 --> 01:24:35.113
I might read from the Latin,
I might read from the English,

01:24:35.114 --> 01:24:36.489
but I'm going to read anyway.

01:24:36.490 --> 01:24:37.949
Okay, this, this,

01:24:38.867 --> 01:24:41.745
this, my friend, is holy water.

01:24:41.746 --> 01:24:43.412
Holy water, fine.

01:24:43.413 --> 01:24:46.249
When I give you the
signal, you take this,

01:24:46.250 --> 01:24:48.000
and you sprinkle it on the machine,

01:24:48.001 --> 01:24:50.753
and you say, "In the name of The Father,

01:24:50.754 --> 01:24:53.506
"The Son, and the Holy Ghost,
get thee from this place.

01:24:53.507 --> 01:24:54.382
"Thou art unclean."

01:24:54.383 --> 01:24:55.237
[John] Okay, okay.

01:24:55.238 --> 01:24:56.091
This is the host.

01:24:56.092 --> 01:24:56.988
The host, all right.

01:24:56.989 --> 01:24:57.885
You break the host.

01:24:57.886 --> 01:24:59.533
You put it on the machine.

01:24:59.534 --> 01:25:01.181
You repeat the incantation.

01:25:01.182 --> 01:25:02.181
Oh!

01:25:02.182 --> 01:25:03.015
The Hand of Glory,

01:25:03.016 --> 01:25:04.350
we don't have to worry about that.

01:25:04.351 --> 01:25:05.267
Get in the car.

01:25:05.268 --> 01:25:06.665
Get in the goddamn car!

01:25:06.666 --> 01:25:08.063
You always do this to me!

01:25:09.105 --> 01:25:10.105
Wait up!

01:25:11.149 --> 01:25:15.028
(suspenseful orchestral music)

01:25:27.791 --> 01:25:30.001
(grunting)

01:25:35.131 --> 01:25:37.967
God of all machines,

01:25:39.094 --> 01:25:42.806
God that meshes good and evil,

01:25:45.266 --> 01:25:50.021
accept this blood of my blood,

01:25:50.022 --> 01:25:52.732
because I am signing off.

01:25:53.900 --> 01:25:55.193
Payment in full!

01:25:57.153 --> 01:26:00.198
(machine clattering)

01:26:21.719 --> 01:26:23.513
See you later, Sherry.

01:26:38.027 --> 01:26:39.237
- Sherry!
- No!

01:26:40.738 --> 01:26:41.738
Piss off!

01:26:42.907 --> 01:26:45.450
(growling)

01:26:45.451 --> 01:26:46.702
You've got no right!

01:26:46.703 --> 01:26:47.954
You have no right!

01:26:47.955 --> 01:26:49.121
(yelling)

01:26:49.122 --> 01:26:50.352
(steam hissing)

01:26:50.353 --> 01:26:51.583
You have no right!

01:26:51.584 --> 01:26:52.416
(screaming)

01:26:52.417 --> 01:26:54.502
No right, no right!

01:26:54.503 --> 01:26:55.586
No.

01:26:55.587 --> 01:26:57.797
(grunting)

01:26:59.090 --> 01:27:00.466
(screaming)

01:27:00.467 --> 01:27:01.466
God!

01:27:03.261 --> 01:27:05.471
(grunting)

01:27:06.848 --> 01:27:07.974
Goddamn you!

01:27:09.726 --> 01:27:12.019
(metal scraping)

01:27:12.020 --> 01:27:13.897
You miserable piece of dogfuck!

01:27:13.898 --> 01:27:15.961
How dare you!

01:27:15.962 --> 01:27:18.026
(metal scraping)

01:27:21.196 --> 01:27:22.739
[Mark] Let me go!

01:27:23.907 --> 01:27:25.450
[John] So this is the price of power?

01:27:25.451 --> 01:27:27.702
This is the price of power?

01:27:27.703 --> 01:27:29.996
(screaming)

01:27:34.292 --> 01:27:35.418
Here's the truth, Gartley.

01:27:35.419 --> 01:27:36.418
It's done.

01:27:40.757 --> 01:27:43.051
(screaming)

01:27:47.055 --> 01:27:48.473
(bones crunching)

01:27:48.474 --> 01:27:49.473
Lin Sue.

01:27:51.142 --> 01:27:56.105
(bones crunching)
(screaming)

01:27:56.356 --> 01:27:58.566
(grunting)

01:28:00.526 --> 01:28:03.238
(Bill screaming)

01:28:04.364 --> 01:28:05.740
Lin Sue, Lin Sue!

01:28:08.368 --> 01:28:09.326
Lin Sue!

01:28:09.327 --> 01:28:11.037
Okay, stay with me.

01:28:12.330 --> 01:28:13.456
Trespassers!

01:28:19.545 --> 01:28:20.545
Lin Sue!

01:28:22.090 --> 01:28:23.090
My Lin Sue!

01:28:30.431 --> 01:28:31.557
Off the clock.

01:28:35.895 --> 01:28:36.895
Out of time?

01:28:38.231 --> 01:28:40.691
(grunting)

01:28:40.692 --> 01:28:43.486
(metal squeaking)

01:28:49.659 --> 01:28:51.953
(screaming)

01:29:03.214 --> 01:29:06.843
(speaking foreign language)

01:29:11.764 --> 01:29:14.475
(Bill screaming)

01:29:19.314 --> 01:29:20.314
Oh.

01:29:25.278 --> 01:29:26.945
Oh.

01:29:26.946 --> 01:29:30.575
(speaking foreign language)

01:29:34.787 --> 01:29:36.914
My god, who art in hell,

01:29:38.124 --> 01:29:39.584
cursed be thy name

01:29:42.545 --> 01:29:44.589
Why, you lying son of a...

01:29:52.055 --> 01:29:53.055
Fuck you.

01:29:55.058 --> 01:29:56.851
(speaking foreign language)

01:29:56.852 --> 01:29:59.708
(electricity zapping)

01:29:59.709 --> 01:30:02.564
Stay back, stay back!

01:30:02.565 --> 01:30:03.900
What do you want me to do?

01:30:03.901 --> 01:30:04.816
Help me.

01:30:04.817 --> 01:30:06.151
Okay, when I point to you,

01:30:06.152 --> 01:30:08.529
you take the holy water,
sprinkle it in the machine,

01:30:08.530 --> 01:30:09.696
and you say,

01:30:09.697 --> 01:30:11.532
(speaking foreign language)

01:30:11.533 --> 01:30:13.576
[John] Okay, all right.

01:30:13.577 --> 01:30:15.036
(speaking foreign language)

01:30:15.037 --> 01:30:16.621
Then I will show you again.

01:30:16.622 --> 01:30:18.060
Then you put the host in.

01:30:18.061 --> 01:30:20.593
Repeat the incantation.

01:30:20.594 --> 01:30:23.127
(speaking foreign language)

01:30:24.962 --> 01:30:26.651
(steam hissing)

01:30:26.652 --> 01:30:28.341
(screaming)

01:30:37.725 --> 01:30:39.622
In the host!

01:30:39.623 --> 01:30:41.521
(screaming)

01:30:43.731 --> 01:30:46.526
In the name of The Father,
The Son, and the Holy Ghost,

01:30:46.527 --> 01:30:47.944
get thee from this place!

01:30:47.945 --> 01:30:49.319
Thou art unclean!

01:30:49.320 --> 01:30:52.949
(speaking foreign language)

01:30:54.033 --> 01:30:54.866
Holy shit!

01:30:54.867 --> 01:30:55.867
This ain't working!

01:30:56.786 --> 01:30:58.203
Shit.

01:30:58.204 --> 01:31:01.833
(speaking foreign language)

01:31:10.883 --> 01:31:12.760
Our father, who art in heaven,

01:31:12.761 --> 01:31:14.594
hallowed be thy name.

01:31:14.595 --> 01:31:16.431
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done

01:31:16.432 --> 01:31:18.099
on earth as it is in heaven.

01:31:18.100 --> 01:31:20.205
Give us this day our daily bread

01:31:20.206 --> 01:31:22.311
and forgive us our trespasses

01:31:22.312 --> 01:31:23.895
Trespass against us,

01:31:23.896 --> 01:31:25.982
and lead us not into temptation,

01:31:25.983 --> 01:31:28.150
but deliver us from evil,

01:31:28.151 --> 01:31:30.695
for thine is the power, the goodness,

01:31:30.696 --> 01:31:32.447
and the glory forever.

01:31:32.448 --> 01:31:34.448
Sight to idols,

01:31:34.449 --> 01:31:37.242
nor make gods of thyself,

01:31:37.243 --> 01:31:41.122
for the land will vomit you up,

01:31:41.123 --> 01:31:43.248
for defiling it,

01:31:43.249 --> 01:31:46.961
as it vomited up nations before thee!

01:31:46.962 --> 01:31:48.963
Amen, goddamn it!

01:31:48.964 --> 01:31:51.215
(screaming)

01:31:52.925 --> 01:31:53.885
(electricity zapping)

01:31:53.886 --> 01:31:56.533
(metal creaking)

01:31:56.534 --> 01:31:59.182
(Sherry crying)

01:32:11.360 --> 01:32:12.465
Look!

01:32:12.466 --> 01:32:13.570
Yeah!

01:32:13.571 --> 01:32:14.571
We did it!

01:32:15.364 --> 01:32:16.531
Huh?

01:32:16.532 --> 01:32:18.326
We did it!

01:32:20.453 --> 01:32:21.746
We did it, we did it.

01:32:21.747 --> 01:32:23.956
(laughing)

01:32:25.500 --> 01:32:26.500
It's dead!

01:32:27.877 --> 01:32:30.838
(breathing heavily)

01:32:32.924 --> 01:32:35.134
(coughing)

01:32:38.721 --> 01:32:39.554
Oh, man.

01:32:39.555 --> 01:32:41.933
Now I know where you get
your flaky stomach from.

01:32:44.727 --> 01:32:46.311
Let me take one of those.

01:32:46.312 --> 01:32:47.438
I don't do drugs, but I need this.

01:32:47.439 --> 01:32:48.355
You okay?

01:32:48.356 --> 01:32:49.272
Really?

01:32:50.233 --> 01:32:51.316
What's in this?

01:32:51.317 --> 01:32:52.296
I don't know.

01:32:52.297 --> 01:32:53.276
They're antacids.

01:32:53.277 --> 01:32:54.654
I got them from Mrs. Frawley.

01:33:00.201 --> 01:33:01.201
Belladonna?

01:33:02.161 --> 01:33:03.746
You got these from Mrs. Frawley?

01:33:06.374 --> 01:33:07.374
The Hand of Glory?

01:33:08.501 --> 01:33:10.169
[Mark] I think we may be fucked.

01:33:12.922 --> 01:33:15.007
(electricity zapping)

01:33:15.008 --> 01:33:16.446
(yelling)

01:33:16.447 --> 01:33:17.884
Oh, god!

01:33:17.885 --> 01:33:18.885
[John] Shit.

01:33:18.886 --> 01:33:20.721
(machine exploding)

01:33:20.722 --> 01:33:23.015
(screaming)

01:33:31.732 --> 01:33:32.732
Oh, shit!

01:33:37.655 --> 01:33:39.510
Oh, god!

01:33:39.511 --> 01:33:41.366
(screaming)

01:33:41.367 --> 01:33:44.245
(machine growling)

01:33:45.246 --> 01:33:47.540
(screaming)

01:33:59.218 --> 01:34:00.886
Do you know a way out of here?

01:34:00.887 --> 01:34:01.886
No, no!

01:34:04.098 --> 01:34:05.850
(metal clanging)

01:34:05.851 --> 01:34:08.144
(screaming)

01:34:14.108 --> 01:34:15.401
Run, run, run!

01:34:17.236 --> 01:34:19.530
(screaming)

01:34:21.240 --> 01:34:23.825
(metal clanging)

01:34:23.826 --> 01:34:25.620
[Mark] We're fucked!

01:34:31.584 --> 01:34:32.752
We're fucked!

01:34:32.753 --> 01:34:33.752
Oh, god!

01:34:35.129 --> 01:34:36.504
No!

01:34:36.505 --> 01:34:38.633
(screaming)

01:34:38.634 --> 01:34:39.633
John!

01:34:40.426 --> 01:34:41.426
Mark!

01:34:43.971 --> 01:34:46.015
[Sherry] It won't open!

01:34:50.019 --> 01:34:51.019
If I walk through the valley

01:34:51.020 --> 01:34:52.271
of the shadow of death, I fear no evil.

01:34:52.272 --> 01:34:55.128
(screaming)

01:34:55.129 --> 01:34:57.985
(steam hissing)

01:34:57.986 --> 01:34:58.923
Johnny!

01:34:58.924 --> 01:34:59.861
Mark!

01:35:01.906 --> 01:35:02.906
No!

01:35:03.658 --> 01:35:04.658
Mark!

01:35:10.331 --> 01:35:12.541
(grunting)

01:35:18.297 --> 01:35:20.611
(Sherry crying)

01:35:20.612 --> 01:35:22.927
(wall exploding)

01:35:22.928 --> 01:35:25.221
(screaming)

01:35:43.364 --> 01:35:44.197
Come here!

01:35:44.198 --> 01:35:45.116
What are you doing?

01:35:45.117 --> 01:35:45.949
Let go!

01:35:45.950 --> 01:35:46.783
Save yourself!

01:35:46.784 --> 01:35:47.617
It wants me!

01:35:47.618 --> 01:35:48.493
[John] Over my dead body!

01:35:48.494 --> 01:35:49.369
[Sherry] Are you crazy?

01:35:49.370 --> 01:35:50.516
[John] No, I'm a policeman.

01:35:50.517 --> 01:35:51.664
[Sherry] But it wants me!

01:35:51.665 --> 01:35:52.664
It wants me!

01:35:56.085 --> 01:35:58.524
(machine growling)

01:35:58.525 --> 01:36:00.965
[John] Sherry!

01:36:00.966 --> 01:36:01.965
Sherry!

01:36:02.883 --> 01:36:03.717
Sherry!

01:36:03.718 --> 01:36:06.595
(Sherry screaming)

01:36:14.687 --> 01:36:16.355
(metal clanging)

01:36:16.356 --> 01:36:17.188
Jump!

01:36:17.189 --> 01:36:19.441
(screaming)

01:36:19.442 --> 01:36:23.028
(electricity zapping)

01:36:23.029 --> 01:36:25.156
(gasping)

01:36:28.784 --> 01:36:31.203
Leave her alone, goddamn you!

01:36:31.204 --> 01:36:32.496
Leave her alone!

01:36:39.962 --> 01:36:40.795
No!

01:36:40.796 --> 01:36:41.796
Goddamn you!

01:36:43.174 --> 01:36:45.613
Leave her alone!

01:36:45.614 --> 01:36:48.053
(Sherry screaming)

01:36:53.309 --> 01:36:56.020
(both screaming)

01:37:14.705 --> 01:37:17.333
(Sherry crying)

01:37:25.216 --> 01:37:28.594
(light orchestral music)

01:37:42.775 --> 01:37:44.902
(panting)

01:38:03.838 --> 01:38:07.132
(footsteps approaching)

01:38:12.721 --> 01:38:14.556
Sherry's all right.

01:38:14.557 --> 01:38:15.850
She's lost a lot of blood,

01:38:15.851 --> 01:38:16.809
but she'll recover.

01:38:16.810 --> 01:38:18.373
(sighing)

01:38:18.374 --> 01:38:19.936
Thank god.

01:38:19.937 --> 01:38:21.522
Mind telling me what happened?

01:38:27.820 --> 01:38:29.071
Yeah, I do mind.

01:38:33.325 --> 01:38:34.451
Can I go see her?

01:38:34.452 --> 01:38:35.869
No.

01:38:35.870 --> 01:38:36.870
She's resting.

01:38:37.955 --> 01:38:39.123
Maybe tomorrow.

01:38:47.214 --> 01:38:48.506
Okay.

01:38:48.507 --> 01:38:50.050
Thank you, doctor.

01:38:50.051 --> 01:38:51.050
Thank you.

01:38:52.761 --> 01:38:54.388
[Doctor] Tomorrow.

01:38:58.142 --> 01:39:01.228
(eerie chiming music)

01:39:47.483 --> 01:39:50.444
(windchime chiming)

01:40:05.793 --> 01:40:07.336
Morning, officer.

01:40:09.421 --> 01:40:10.881
Have a nice day.

01:40:15.469 --> 01:40:17.679
[Photographer] Dearest Johnny,

01:40:17.680 --> 01:40:20.599
in this envelope you'll
find vital information

01:40:20.600 --> 01:40:22.101
that may save your life.

01:40:23.143 --> 01:40:26.563
The old-timers in Riker's
valley had a saying

01:40:26.564 --> 01:40:29.983
"Beware of people with missing parts.

01:40:29.984 --> 01:40:32.987
"There's a piece of each
of them in the demon"

01:40:32.988 --> 01:40:37.095
"and a dose of the demon in each of them."

01:40:37.096 --> 01:40:41.203
"Faithfully yours, J.J.J. Pictureman."

01:40:48.711 --> 01:40:51.672
(workers murmuring)

01:41:06.311 --> 01:41:09.940
(dramatic orchestral music)

01:41:13.527 --> 01:41:14.360
[Sherry] Herb!

01:41:14.361 --> 01:41:16.196
I've got a big load of sheets
coming within the hour!

01:41:16.197 --> 01:41:17.614
Now, get a move on!

01:41:17.615 --> 01:41:19.033
Come on, ladies!

01:41:19.034 --> 01:41:20.033
Move it up!

01:41:22.786 --> 01:41:24.746
There's never enough time around here!

01:41:24.747 --> 01:41:26.706
I'm not running a charity here, Herb!

01:41:26.707 --> 01:41:30.044
Tell them to get their lazy asses in gear!

01:41:30.045 --> 01:41:30.877
[John] Sherry?

01:41:30.878 --> 01:41:32.296
You heard the boss!

01:41:32.297 --> 01:41:33.296
Keep moving!

01:41:34.590 --> 01:41:38.218
(dramatic orchestral music)

01:42:24.890 --> 01:42:27.768
