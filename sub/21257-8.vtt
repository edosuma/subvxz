00:08.609 --> 00:12.513
So then he said, "You must have
a Napoleon complex."

00:12.546 --> 00:15.916
So I said, "Why?
Because I'm a normal height?"

00:15.949 --> 00:19.019
Napoleon wasn't that short!
(laughter and applause)

00:19.053 --> 00:22.022
Adam, you certainly do
fit in around here.

00:22.056 --> 00:23.524
You're the bee's knees.

00:23.557 --> 00:24.858
Bees don't have knees!

00:24.892 --> 00:27.395
Their legs have joints
but not kneecaps.

00:28.729 --> 00:31.699
So nice to spend
my birthday with my peers.

00:31.732 --> 00:33.000
If only...

00:33.033 --> 00:34.168
Adam, what's wrong?

00:34.202 --> 00:36.104
Wrong?
What could be wrong

00:36.137 --> 00:38.005
when I'm surrounded by
my smartest friends

00:38.038 --> 00:40.007
with the highest IQs?

00:40.040 --> 00:41.542
Actually...

00:41.575 --> 00:44.044
Emily!
You did remember.

00:44.078 --> 00:46.780
Of course, buddy.
Wait'll you see my gift.

00:46.814 --> 00:50.218
Wait a second.
You said "actually."

00:50.251 --> 00:51.752
Are you here
to ruin something?

00:51.785 --> 00:53.954
Oh, I'm not just
gonna ruin something.

00:53.987 --> 00:57.091
I'm gonna ruin... you.
For your birthday,

00:57.125 --> 00:58.392
I'm gonna show you
why you're wrong

00:58.426 --> 00:59.393
about how right
you are.

00:59.427 --> 01:02.196
No!
Because I'm Emily Axford,

01:02.230 --> 01:05.466
and this is Emily Ruins
"Adam Ruins Everything."

01:05.499 --> 01:06.734

Oh, this is

01:19.347 --> 01:20.614
I love it when
you do this.

01:20.648 --> 01:23.384
What are you gonna ruin?
Herpetology? Wikipedia?

01:23.417 --> 01:25.486
(gasps)
Not pocket squares!

01:25.519 --> 01:27.455
Nope.
Adam...

01:27.488 --> 01:29.089
I'm afraid we cannot
grant entry

01:29.123 --> 01:32.760
to this... scissorbill,
this lummox.

01:32.793 --> 01:34.495
Mindsa is
an exclusive club

01:34.528 --> 01:36.830
for people who score
very highly on IQ tests

01:36.864 --> 01:38.299
and who define
their entire identity

01:38.332 --> 01:40.468
around scoring high
on said test.

01:40.501 --> 01:41.902
Checkmate.

01:41.935 --> 01:43.137
I'm sorry, Em.

01:43.171 --> 01:45.072
Totally, the kid genius
is right.

01:45.105 --> 01:46.607
Unless you take
an IQ test,

01:46.640 --> 01:47.775
there's no way to know

01:47.808 --> 01:49.410
if you're smart enough
to be here.

01:49.443 --> 01:51.812
Actually,
that's not true.

01:51.845 --> 01:54.515
We think IQ tests
are objective evaluations

01:54.548 --> 01:57.151
of our mental abilities,
but in reality

01:57.185 --> 01:59.487
they are deeply biased
and controversial tools

01:59.520 --> 02:01.522
that might not predict
intelligence at all.

02:01.555 --> 02:02.523
(gasps)

02:02.556 --> 02:04.024
Emily, don't embarrass
yourself.

02:04.057 --> 02:07.027
Measuring intelligence
is what IQ tests are for.

02:07.060 --> 02:09.430
Wrong again!
The first IQ test

02:09.463 --> 02:11.932
was never intended
to measure intelligence.

02:11.965 --> 02:14.468
In fact, it was invented
in 1904 as a way

02:14.502 --> 02:17.871
to assess which French kids
were doing well in kindergarten.

02:17.905 --> 02:19.640
(French accent)
Wine is to lunch

02:19.673 --> 02:21.709
as cigarette is...

02:21.742 --> 02:23.377
To recess?

02:23.411 --> 02:24.612
Excellent!

02:24.645 --> 02:27.047
You are now ready for
the French first grade.

02:27.080 --> 02:28.716
Huh, that's awfully
specific.

02:28.749 --> 02:30.718
Well, the inventor
of the test, Alfred Binet,

02:30.751 --> 02:32.653
said that was the point.

02:32.686 --> 02:33.887
My test is for children.

02:33.921 --> 02:36.156
It is not meant to apply
to everyone.

02:36.190 --> 02:37.458
But, that all changed

02:37.491 --> 02:40.328
thanks to a man named
H.H. Goddard.

02:40.361 --> 02:42.630
I'm gonna apply
this test to everyone.

02:42.663 --> 02:43.664
Hey, everybody!

02:43.697 --> 02:45.866
Let's all take
this intelligence test!

02:45.899 --> 02:47.868
(Emily)
People liked intelligence
testing so much

02:47.901 --> 02:51.239
that within a few years,
IQ tests had swept the nation.

02:51.272 --> 02:53.574
This test says
I'm a regular Marie Curie.

02:53.607 --> 02:55.243
I'm positively glowing.

02:55.276 --> 02:56.744
Mine says I'm dumber
than a dewdropper

02:56.777 --> 02:58.045
all zozzled
on a Sunday.

02:58.078 --> 02:59.980
Well, I'll never
marry you now.

03:00.013 --> 03:01.148
And today,
we use them to tell

03:01.181 --> 03:02.883
how intelligent we are.

03:02.916 --> 03:04.685
End of ruin?
Nope!

03:04.718 --> 03:06.554
The only thing
IQ tests tell you

03:06.587 --> 03:08.522
is how good you are
at IQ tests.

03:08.556 --> 03:10.691
Early tests focused
almost entirely

03:10.724 --> 03:13.727
on concepts that only
rich white folks would know.

03:13.761 --> 03:15.763
That can't be true.
I'm not rich,

03:15.796 --> 03:17.598
and I can answer
these questions.

03:17.631 --> 03:20.668
Describe everything
required by a regatta.

03:20.701 --> 03:23.837
Okay, boats,
water, and...

03:23.871 --> 03:26.374
wait, I don't know.

03:26.407 --> 03:29.076
My God...
he forgot buoys!

03:29.109 --> 03:31.612
But that question doesn't
measure my intelligence.

03:31.645 --> 03:32.746
I've just never
been exposed

03:32.780 --> 03:35.383
to nautical athletics...
or any athletics.

03:35.416 --> 03:36.784
Exactly!

03:36.817 --> 03:38.719
We act like these tests
are objective,

03:38.752 --> 03:40.621
but the truth is,
they're actually biased

03:40.654 --> 03:42.790
towards people with similar
life experiences

03:42.823 --> 03:44.525
to the test makers.
(man clears throat)

03:44.558 --> 03:48.128
I do not aim to condescend,
but I shall.

03:48.161 --> 03:50.431
If the exam
is so blinkered,

03:50.464 --> 03:54.602
why is it the foremost criterion
of empiricists everywhere?

03:54.635 --> 03:55.803
Thank you,
human thesaurus.

03:55.836 --> 03:56.804
I would also like
to know

03:56.837 --> 03:58.739
why IQ tests are
the scientific standard.

03:58.772 --> 04:01.909
Great question.
They aren't.

04:01.942 --> 04:04.278
There is no such thing
as a standard IQ test.

04:04.312 --> 04:06.213
In fact, the two
most popular tests,

04:06.246 --> 04:07.815
the Stanford-Binet
and the Wechsler,

04:07.848 --> 04:08.916
measure different things

04:08.949 --> 04:11.419
and can often give
very different results.

04:11.452 --> 04:13.120
This test says
I'm a kid genius,

04:13.153 --> 04:15.122
but this one says
I'm a kid dunce.

04:15.155 --> 04:16.990
That means
I average out to...

04:17.024 --> 04:19.727
Normal!

04:19.760 --> 04:21.629
No!
Do you hear her?

04:21.662 --> 04:24.498
These tests are pointless!
Help!

04:24.532 --> 04:26.834
Emily, the test
is just for fun.

04:26.867 --> 04:27.935
What's the harm

04:27.968 --> 04:29.503
in doing puzzles
and getting graded?

04:29.537 --> 04:31.739
You know, some adults
miss grades.

04:31.772 --> 04:34.608
The harm is, these puzzles
have been used by racists

04:34.642 --> 04:36.444
to discriminate against
people of color.

04:36.477 --> 04:39.079
Okay, Emily,
puzzles cannot be racist.

04:39.112 --> 04:40.781
Look at this one.
You just get all

04:40.814 --> 04:44.117
the colors on separate
but equal... Oh.

04:44.151 --> 04:45.419
Remember H.H. Goddard,

04:45.453 --> 04:47.855
the guy who popularized
the IQ test.

04:47.888 --> 04:49.590
He used it
to cherry-pick data

04:49.623 --> 04:52.526
to justify his own
racist beliefs.

04:52.560 --> 04:54.261
Who wants to take
my fun little test

04:54.294 --> 04:56.530
that proves the white race
is superior?

04:56.564 --> 04:58.265
(Emily)
And it gets worse.

04:58.298 --> 05:00.033
Goddard was a member
on something called the...

05:03.236 --> 05:04.304
No.

05:04.338 --> 05:05.539
Please don't tell me...
Yep.

05:05.573 --> 05:07.875
In the 20th century,
state governments

05:07.908 --> 05:09.443
used low IQ scores

05:09.477 --> 05:11.979
as an excuse
to sterilize people.

05:12.012 --> 05:14.181
Sorry, but you didn't
know what a regatta was.

05:14.214 --> 05:17.217
That means, you're dumb.
Too dumb to breed.

05:17.250 --> 05:18.285
(all gasping)

05:18.318 --> 05:19.687
Son of a bobwhite,

05:19.720 --> 05:21.722
we actually
sterilized people?

05:21.755 --> 05:23.290
This can't be possible.

05:23.323 --> 05:25.559
Sadly, Adam,
it's more than possible.

05:25.593 --> 05:26.727
It happened.

05:26.760 --> 05:29.296
Emily, you even
got me an expert!

05:29.329 --> 05:31.064
Wow.
Happy birthday.

05:31.098 --> 05:32.299
This is Rebecca Kluchin.

05:32.332 --> 05:34.167
She's a professor
at Sacramento State,

05:34.201 --> 05:35.302
and she's an expert

05:35.335 --> 05:37.971
in America's tragic legacy
of sterilization.

05:38.005 --> 05:39.807
When IQ tests
first originated,

05:39.840 --> 05:41.509
people like Goddard thought
they'd be a good way

05:41.542 --> 05:43.243
to weed out recent
European immigrants

05:43.276 --> 05:44.244
who might pass
as white.

05:44.277 --> 05:46.680
IQ scores were used
to conclude

05:46.714 --> 05:48.416
that lower-class whites,
people of color,

05:48.449 --> 05:49.683
and people
with disabilities

05:49.717 --> 05:51.985
would be better off
removed from the gene pool.

05:52.019 --> 05:54.054
Wow, I did not know that.

05:54.087 --> 05:56.557
Over 60,000 people
in 32 states

05:56.590 --> 05:58.426
were sterilized through
states eugenics laws,

05:58.459 --> 06:00.428
many because
of this one test.

06:00.461 --> 06:02.930
And we still use IQ tests
in death penalty cases

06:02.963 --> 06:05.098
to define who should live
and who should die.

06:05.132 --> 06:08.001
That's insane!
It's just a stupid test!

06:08.035 --> 06:09.537
Yeah, but when
you make the mistake

06:09.570 --> 06:11.271
of reducing intelligence
down to one number,

06:11.304 --> 06:12.339
it's easy to cast that

06:12.372 --> 06:14.274
as proof of natural
superiority.

06:14.307 --> 06:16.444
Intelligence isn't
one single quality.

06:16.477 --> 06:18.045
It's made up of
a variety of things,

06:18.078 --> 06:19.780
like memory,
learning,

06:19.813 --> 06:21.582
mental agility,
and reasoning.

06:21.615 --> 06:23.684
Thanks, Professor!
No problem.

06:23.717 --> 06:25.619
Now I've got to go back
to standing completely still

06:25.653 --> 06:28.422
so no one knows
this painting is alive.

06:28.456 --> 06:29.623
Bye!

06:29.657 --> 06:31.792
The truth is, as much
as you love this club,

06:31.825 --> 06:34.194
IQ tests might not
measure intelligence.

06:34.227 --> 06:35.596
And, they've been
used as a tool

06:35.629 --> 06:37.898
to hurt people
for decades.

06:37.931 --> 06:38.899
Wait.

06:38.932 --> 06:40.968
Human thesaurus,
where are you going?

06:41.001 --> 06:42.870
If intelligence quotients
are meaningless,

06:42.903 --> 06:44.304
then so is Mindsa!

06:44.337 --> 06:47.708
This cerebral fraternity
is bunkum!

06:47.741 --> 06:50.644
No!
My friends!

06:50.678 --> 06:53.781
Well, Emily, I have to
congratulate you.

06:53.814 --> 06:55.649
That was a solid ruin.
Oh, thank you.

06:55.683 --> 06:57.651
But you know what?
I never claimed to be

06:57.685 --> 06:59.987
the most intelligent
person in the world.

07:00.020 --> 07:02.590
I'm just a curious boy
with a TV show.

07:02.623 --> 07:03.957
A show reviewers
have called,

07:03.991 --> 07:05.593
"renewed for
a second season."

07:05.626 --> 07:07.294
Aw, too bad
you've actually

07:07.327 --> 07:09.497
gotten stuff wrong
on that TV show.

07:09.530 --> 07:10.664
And I'll tell you
all about it

07:10.698 --> 07:11.832
right after this.

07:11.865 --> 07:13.767
Oh, that was also
a solid act tease.

07:13.801 --> 07:15.368
Shh, this is my moment.

07:19.172 --> 07:20.674
Ah, my crew!

07:20.708 --> 07:22.676
Thank you guys
for working hard to ensure

07:22.710 --> 07:26.346
we deliver the best,
most accurate information.

07:26.379 --> 07:28.081
Oh, good morning,
Jorge!

07:28.115 --> 07:30.083
Good morning, Adam.
Adam...

07:30.117 --> 07:31.451
how's the online
girlfriend?

07:31.485 --> 07:32.586
I don't wanna
get ahead of myself,

07:32.620 --> 07:34.287
but it's getting
pretty serious.

07:34.321 --> 07:35.422
Take it from me,

07:35.455 --> 07:37.525
don't send any
below-the-waist stuff.

07:37.558 --> 07:39.793
You ready to shoot?
I was born ready.

07:39.827 --> 07:42.663
I live for facts.

07:42.696 --> 07:44.598
Then prepare to die.
Aah!

07:44.632 --> 07:46.700
Emily.
Adam.

07:46.734 --> 07:50.103
You act like this is
the most factual show on TV,

07:50.137 --> 07:52.172
but the truth is...

07:52.205 --> 07:54.041
you've gotten things
wrong.

07:54.074 --> 07:57.277
Wait, are you gonna do
a correction segment?

07:57.310 --> 07:58.679
I've always wanted
to do one of those!

07:59.747 --> 08:00.914
Well, let's see
how ya like it!

08:02.683 --> 08:06.720
Exhibit A, "Adam Ruins
Forensic Science."

08:06.754 --> 08:09.056
You claimed
that DNA was

08:09.089 --> 08:11.491
the only foolproof
type of evidence.

08:12.760 --> 08:14.895
The killer's DNA is all over
this crime scene.

08:14.928 --> 08:16.730
We'll know for certain
who killed this man.

08:16.764 --> 08:18.298
(cell door closing, slams)

08:18.331 --> 08:19.833
But according
to new research,

08:19.867 --> 08:22.402
DNA evidence can suffer
from the same problems

08:22.435 --> 08:25.172
as other forensic science,
such as incomplete samples

08:25.205 --> 08:27.474
and crime scene
contamination.

08:27.507 --> 08:29.009
(sneezes)

08:30.077 --> 08:31.078
My bad.

08:31.111 --> 08:33.046
When German police
found matching DNA

08:33.080 --> 08:34.815
at 40 different
crime scenes,

08:34.848 --> 08:36.584
they concluded it was
a serial killer

08:36.617 --> 08:39.152
called the Phantom
of Heilbronn.

08:39.186 --> 08:40.588
(German accent)
Mein Gott!

08:40.621 --> 08:44.257
40 crimes, 40 cotton swabs
with the same DNA?

08:44.291 --> 08:45.859
What a ruthless killer.

08:45.893 --> 08:47.160
(Emily)
It turned out,

08:47.194 --> 08:49.062
that matching DNA
was actually from a woman

08:49.096 --> 08:51.364
at the factory that made
the cotton swabs.

08:51.398 --> 08:53.901
**

08:53.934 --> 08:57.605
This will make it clean
for my nice police officers.

08:59.306 --> 09:03.210
So, face it,
DNA evidence isn't foolproof.

09:03.243 --> 09:04.678
You're ruined.

09:04.712 --> 09:06.113
Wow.

09:06.146 --> 09:08.849
Thank you
for bringing this up!

09:08.882 --> 09:10.417
It's true.
Since that episode aired,

09:10.450 --> 09:12.019
we have learned
that DNA evidence

09:12.052 --> 09:13.453
is not infallible.

09:13.486 --> 09:15.455
And even though
it's still an amazing tool,

09:15.488 --> 09:16.790
we need to use it
carefully

09:16.824 --> 09:18.391
and think about it critically.
Wha--!

09:18.425 --> 09:21.094
Hey, bud, so,
all this is on-camera...

09:22.262 --> 09:23.697
so you shouldn't be
so happy about being wrong,

09:23.731 --> 09:25.298
'cause people will think that
you don't care about the facts.

09:25.332 --> 09:27.234
Oh, I really care
about the facts.

09:27.267 --> 09:29.302
That's why I'm excited
for this.

09:29.336 --> 09:31.238
Hit me with
another one.
Okay.

09:31.271 --> 09:32.806
(clears throat)

09:32.840 --> 09:36.476
(gasps)
Oh, this one's a doozy!

09:36.509 --> 09:38.111
You specifically said

09:38.145 --> 09:40.914
that air marshals
stop terrorist attacks.

09:40.948 --> 09:42.382
(Emily)
That just ain't true.

09:42.415 --> 09:43.984
Between 2001
and 2008,

09:44.017 --> 09:45.753
air marshals didn't make
one arrest

09:45.786 --> 09:47.054
related to terrorism.

09:47.087 --> 09:50.490
Ugh, why are there never
any terrorists to shoot?

09:50.523 --> 09:52.225
(whining)
I'm bored.

09:52.259 --> 09:54.427
The few arrests they do make
are drunk people

09:54.461 --> 09:56.296
and celebrities
who won't get off their phones.

09:56.329 --> 09:57.497
A-ha! Gotcha!

09:57.530 --> 09:59.432
And we're paying
through the nose for it.

09:59.466 --> 10:01.735
Taxpayers spent
$800 million

10:01.769 --> 10:04.504
on air marshals in 2014 alone.

10:04.537 --> 10:06.974
And since they only make
around four arrests per year,

10:07.007 --> 10:10.443
that's about $200 million
per arrest.

10:10.477 --> 10:12.646
Air marshals
are so ineffective,

10:12.680 --> 10:14.414
one member of Congress
has even called

10:14.447 --> 10:16.283
for the program
to be abolished.

10:16.316 --> 10:17.751
Wow, yep.
Sounds like

10:17.785 --> 10:19.586
we were definitely
wrong on that one.

10:19.619 --> 10:21.521
(all gasp)
Adam...

10:21.554 --> 10:23.523
hey, man, be cool.
This is a steady gig.

10:23.556 --> 10:24.958
Don't go ruining
your credibility

10:24.992 --> 10:26.093
by admitting mistakes.

10:26.126 --> 10:28.195
Oh, no, that'll just
increase our credibility.

10:28.228 --> 10:29.697
Hit me with another one,
Emily!

10:29.730 --> 10:31.431
You sure about that?
Okay.

10:31.464 --> 10:32.866
(clears throat)

10:32.900 --> 10:35.268
Remember that segment
on electric cars?

10:35.302 --> 10:37.805
Whew! People did not
like that one.

10:37.838 --> 10:40.373
Adam, you know I love you
like a weird friend of my wife,

10:40.407 --> 10:42.209
but you were wr-wr-wr-wrong

10:42.242 --> 10:44.211
when you said that no one
should ever buy a Tesla.

10:44.244 --> 10:46.546
Elon Musk is a super brainiac,

10:46.579 --> 10:48.882
and Teslas are totally saving
the planet.

10:48.916 --> 10:50.117
Tesla!

10:50.150 --> 10:51.785
So stop taking money
from "big oil,"

10:51.819 --> 10:53.887
and a do a little something
called research.

10:53.921 --> 10:55.622
(woman)
Babe, what are you doing?

10:55.655 --> 10:58.892
Uh, looking at naked photos!

10:58.926 --> 11:00.060
(whispering)
Please subscribe.

11:01.361 --> 11:03.563
Okay, I know Tesla fans
didn't love that one,

11:03.596 --> 11:06.366
but our argument was actually
more nuanced than that.

11:06.399 --> 11:08.668
First of all, our source
wasn't the oil industry,

11:08.702 --> 11:10.904
it was scientists
and environmental groups.

11:10.938 --> 11:13.240
And their data shows that
in some cases,

11:13.273 --> 11:14.975
buying a brand-new
electric car

11:15.008 --> 11:17.377
can actually increase
your carbon footprint.

11:17.410 --> 11:19.479
But that doesn't mean
that no one should ever buy one.

11:19.512 --> 11:22.215
In fact, our expert in
that episode said the opposite.

11:23.784 --> 11:25.753
(man)
If you really want to help
save the environment,

11:25.786 --> 11:27.587
the best thing you can do
is to reduce

11:27.620 --> 11:30.490
the amount you drive,
and to drive your current car

11:30.523 --> 11:31.759
as long as possible,

11:31.792 --> 11:33.393
provided it's reasonably
efficient.

11:33.426 --> 11:34.928
But if your car
is beyond repair

11:34.962 --> 11:37.264
and you absolutely need
to buy a new one,

11:37.297 --> 11:38.598
then go ahead, buy yourself

11:38.631 --> 11:41.334
a nice, small electric car,
perhaps even a used one.

11:41.368 --> 11:42.602
(button clicks)

11:42.635 --> 11:44.104
(Adam)
Look, we don't hate
electric cars.

11:44.137 --> 11:46.273
Our goal was to show
how even green products

11:46.306 --> 11:47.941
affect our carbon
footprints.

11:47.975 --> 11:49.743
In this case,
our facts weren't wrong.

11:49.777 --> 11:51.845
Our point was just
misunderstood.

11:51.879 --> 11:54.114
Ah, but since
it's your show,

11:54.147 --> 11:56.349
that's on you.
You should have been clearer.

11:56.383 --> 11:58.085
I mean, the title
of the video was...

12:00.320 --> 12:02.289
Do you wonder why people
got the wrong idea?

12:02.322 --> 12:03.957
Yeah, you're right.

12:03.991 --> 12:05.625
If that many people
misread our argument,

12:05.658 --> 12:06.860
that means
we should have done

12:06.894 --> 12:08.395
a better job
explaining it.

12:08.428 --> 12:11.398
Doing nuance on TV is hard,
but that's my job,

12:11.431 --> 12:13.533
so in the future
I'll try to be better.

12:13.566 --> 12:15.302
Okay, have you ever actually
seen your own show?

12:15.335 --> 12:16.970
Because you're supposed
to be getting upset.

12:17.004 --> 12:18.906
That's how everyone knows
I'm doing a good ruin.

12:18.939 --> 12:20.140
One minute till act break.

12:20.173 --> 12:21.809
Ooh, lightning round!

12:23.076 --> 12:24.311
In an "Ever Wonder Why?"
segment,

12:24.344 --> 12:25.478
you said
the Empire State Building

12:25.512 --> 12:27.047
was 12,000 feet tall.

12:27.080 --> 12:28.882
Oh, yeah, that one
was really embarrassing.

12:28.916 --> 12:31.318
It's actually a little
over 1,200 feet tall.

12:31.351 --> 12:32.986
I guess we added
a zero somehow.

12:34.687 --> 12:37.157
In "Adam Ruins Football,"
you referred to a lineman

12:37.190 --> 12:38.491
but pointed at
a linebacker.

12:38.525 --> 12:40.560
I still can't tell
the difference.

12:40.593 --> 12:42.495
Don't let him
get to you, Todd.

12:43.964 --> 12:45.165
And one time,

12:45.198 --> 12:47.334
you showed snowflakes
that have eight sides,

12:47.367 --> 12:49.769
but they almost always
have six.

12:49.803 --> 12:51.338
Sorry, Jorge.

12:51.371 --> 12:53.073
So there
you have it, Adam.

12:53.106 --> 12:57.010
I have proved that
your show makes mistakes!

12:58.711 --> 13:00.613
Okay, why aren't you
storming off?

13:00.647 --> 13:01.815
I mean, I'm starting
to feel like

13:01.849 --> 13:02.850
you don't like
my present.

13:02.883 --> 13:05.685
No, of course I do!
Because you're right,

13:05.718 --> 13:08.255
we have gotten
a few things wrong.

13:08.288 --> 13:10.858
But that doesn't ruin
our show at all.

13:10.891 --> 13:13.293
Look, this is
our research team.

13:13.326 --> 13:15.528
They spend every day
calling experts,

13:15.562 --> 13:18.031
combing through sources
and fact-checking scripts

13:18.065 --> 13:19.366
to ensure that
the information

13:19.399 --> 13:21.368
we present on this show
is as close

13:21.401 --> 13:23.036
to the truth
as possible.

13:23.070 --> 13:24.204
But, they're also human,

13:24.237 --> 13:26.206
and humans sometimes
make mistakes.

13:26.239 --> 13:27.274
(computer beeps)

13:27.307 --> 13:28.775
But this entire show
is predicated

13:28.808 --> 13:31.111
on you being truthful
and honest.
Right!

13:31.144 --> 13:33.981
And it wouldn't be truthful
to claim we're infallible.

13:34.014 --> 13:36.016
The intellectually
honest thing to do

13:36.049 --> 13:37.851
is to be transparent
about our process

13:37.885 --> 13:39.786
and public
about our mistakes.

13:39.819 --> 13:41.554
That's why we put our sources
on-screen,

13:41.588 --> 13:43.723
and why we admit
when we can do better.

13:43.756 --> 13:46.659
The point of our show isn't
to be right every time.

13:46.693 --> 13:47.995
It's to encourage
the audience

13:48.028 --> 13:49.329
to question what
they think they know

13:49.362 --> 13:51.798
and, if we're lucky,
to change a few minds.

13:51.831 --> 13:53.400
Well, then,
I guess you're ready

13:53.433 --> 13:55.102
for the last part
of my gift...

13:56.603 --> 13:58.738
...when I show you why trying
to change people's minds

13:58.771 --> 14:00.407
actually makes things
worse.

14:00.440 --> 14:01.374
(exhales sharply)
Aah!

14:04.377 --> 14:07.747
**

14:07.780 --> 14:09.749
Emily, you know
my pain threshold

14:09.782 --> 14:10.884
is very low.

14:10.918 --> 14:12.019
Isn't there anything
I can do

14:12.052 --> 14:13.420
to change your mind
about this?

14:13.453 --> 14:17.757
Nope. And that, Conover,
is your final lesson.

14:17.790 --> 14:20.227
Your entire show is built
around the idea

14:20.260 --> 14:22.529
that if you present someone
with better information,

14:22.562 --> 14:23.763
you can change
their mind.

14:23.796 --> 14:27.334
But the surprising truth is,
disproving a misconception

14:27.367 --> 14:28.701
can actually strengthen

14:28.735 --> 14:30.670
a person's belief
in that misconception.

14:30.703 --> 14:33.340
It's called
"the backfire effect."

14:33.373 --> 14:35.608
(dinging)

14:35.642 --> 14:37.277
The more you prove
someone wrong,

14:37.310 --> 14:38.611
the more they think
they're right.

14:38.645 --> 14:39.779
That can't be true.

14:39.812 --> 14:41.714
I change people's minds
every day.

14:44.251 --> 14:46.553
Ha! You just proved
my point.

14:46.586 --> 14:48.221
I presented you
with information

14:48.255 --> 14:49.556
that goes against
your thinking

14:49.589 --> 14:51.491
and you just dug
right into your beliefs.

14:52.993 --> 14:54.694
One study found that
when people concerned

14:54.727 --> 14:56.296
about side effects
of the flu shot

14:56.329 --> 14:57.464
were informed
it was safe,

14:57.497 --> 15:00.233
they actually became
less willing to get it.

15:00.267 --> 15:03.236
But that's so illogical!
How is that possible?

15:03.270 --> 15:05.072
Because when you try
to change someone's mind,

15:05.105 --> 15:06.573
the other person
often feels...

15:06.606 --> 15:08.075
(exhales sharply)
(whimpers)

15:08.108 --> 15:09.342
...attacked.
(ding)

15:10.810 --> 15:11.979
Being proven wrong

15:12.012 --> 15:13.913
actually activates
the same area

15:13.947 --> 15:16.616
of the brain
as real, physical pain.

15:18.151 --> 15:20.988
(electricity crackling)

15:21.021 --> 15:22.422
Worldstar.

15:24.024 --> 15:25.325
Stay with me, kid.

15:25.358 --> 15:26.826
Her right hook'll
hurt ya,

15:26.859 --> 15:29.429
but her right facts
will, too.

15:29.462 --> 15:31.298
Being proven wrong
hurts so much,

15:31.331 --> 15:34.234
it often causes a fight
or flight response.

15:34.267 --> 15:36.069
I gotta get outta here!

15:36.103 --> 15:37.770
Nope!
Aah!

15:37.804 --> 15:39.006
You need
to hear this.

15:39.039 --> 15:40.340
Why am I reacting
like this?

15:40.373 --> 15:42.109
Normally, I love
learning new things!

15:42.142 --> 15:45.445
Simple. You're protecting
your identity.

15:45.478 --> 15:47.847
It's called identity
protective cognition.

15:47.880 --> 15:49.782
See, when a person
is corrected on minor trivia,

15:49.816 --> 15:51.284
it doesn't really have
much of an effect.

15:51.318 --> 15:53.186
Thinkin' about
trying SoulCycle.

15:53.220 --> 15:54.621
Oh, don't do it.

15:54.654 --> 15:56.523
You know, some experts
say it can be bad for you.

15:56.556 --> 15:58.525
Huh, good to know.

15:58.558 --> 16:00.994
But, when the truth
threatens their identity,

16:01.028 --> 16:03.463
they push back hard.

16:03.496 --> 16:05.332
You know,
some experts say

16:05.365 --> 16:07.434
that SoulCycle
can be bad for you.

16:07.467 --> 16:08.935
That's not what
my fellow warriors

16:08.968 --> 16:10.837
at SoulCycle HQ say.

16:10.870 --> 16:12.639
Those "experts"
are in the pocket

16:12.672 --> 16:14.774
of "big elliptical."

16:14.807 --> 16:16.543
Okay, this is crazy.

16:16.576 --> 16:18.511
Correcting people
has to work.

16:18.545 --> 16:21.381
It's natural, and it just
feels right, you know?

16:22.849 --> 16:24.384
Ooh,
that's another one.

16:24.417 --> 16:25.785
When a fact contradicts
our belief,

16:25.818 --> 16:28.288
we often hide behind
emotional arguments

16:28.321 --> 16:30.957
that can't be disproven...
like you just did.

16:30.990 --> 16:32.992
(ding)
Whew, my arms are gettin' tired.

16:33.026 --> 16:34.727
Yeah, but that butt's
lookin' slick!

16:36.263 --> 16:39.066
But, that's not how thinking
is supposed to work.

16:39.099 --> 16:42.702
Actually, that's exactly
how thinking works.

16:42.735 --> 16:45.338
The backfire effect happens
because our emotions

16:45.372 --> 16:47.640
are faster
than logical thought.

16:47.674 --> 16:49.076
When our beliefs
are challenged,

16:49.109 --> 16:50.910
our brains
automatically respond

16:50.943 --> 16:53.846
to the perceived attack,
not the new information.

16:53.880 --> 16:55.715
Ah, stop talking!

16:55.748 --> 16:57.384
Just finish me already!

16:57.417 --> 17:00.520
All this means,
it's really hard

17:00.553 --> 17:02.389
to change
people's minds.

17:02.422 --> 17:03.723
The sad truth is,

17:03.756 --> 17:05.358
humans have
a really difficult time

17:05.392 --> 17:08.761
telling good facts
from their own biased beliefs.

17:09.796 --> 17:10.830
Oh...

17:10.863 --> 17:12.332
I think he's down
for the count.

17:12.365 --> 17:14.567
Adam, this is
Steve Lewandowsky,

17:14.601 --> 17:16.203
a professor at
the University of Bristol

17:16.236 --> 17:18.705
and a co-author of
"The Debunking Handbook,"

17:18.738 --> 17:20.873
a guide to changing
people's minds.

17:20.907 --> 17:24.111
It's too late.
My show's ruined!

17:24.144 --> 17:26.446
Changing minds
is impossible!

17:26.479 --> 17:28.781
No, Adam,
it's not impossible.

17:28.815 --> 17:30.250
It's just that
you can't rely

17:30.283 --> 17:31.951
on giving people
a set of facts

17:31.984 --> 17:34.087
that is in conflict
with their beliefs,

17:34.121 --> 17:36.189
and then expect that
to stick.

17:36.223 --> 17:38.158
You have to
do more than that.

17:40.727 --> 17:42.462
Simply saying
"You're wrong"

17:42.495 --> 17:44.131
isn't gonna
convince anyone.

17:44.164 --> 17:46.266
By repeating your correction
just once,

17:46.299 --> 17:47.967
you may inadvertently
remind them

17:48.000 --> 17:49.402
of their misconception.

17:49.436 --> 17:51.037
That's why
it's so important

17:51.070 --> 17:53.473
to repeat facts
more than once,

17:53.506 --> 17:55.242
over and over again.

17:55.275 --> 17:56.576
Okay.

17:56.609 --> 17:58.711
Another tip:
instead of simply saying

17:58.745 --> 18:00.480
that something
isn't true,

18:00.513 --> 18:01.614
provide people with

18:01.648 --> 18:04.251
an alternative narrative
that is true.

18:04.284 --> 18:05.485
You must replace

18:05.518 --> 18:07.620
a bad explanation
with a good one.

18:07.654 --> 18:10.623
The fact is, humans just
aren't that logical.

18:10.657 --> 18:14.394
We're complex, biased,
emotional creatures.

18:14.427 --> 18:16.563
If you really want
to change people's minds

18:16.596 --> 18:18.665
and correct
their mistakes,

18:18.698 --> 18:20.066
you have to accept that.

18:20.099 --> 18:21.801
But if you do,
it can work.

18:22.969 --> 18:25.972
Well... thanks, guys.

18:26.005 --> 18:27.507
I learned a lot.

18:27.540 --> 18:29.176
Now, if you'll
excuse me, guys,

18:29.209 --> 18:31.378
I need to put in some time
on the speed bags.

18:32.445 --> 18:33.846
Thanks, Professor!

18:33.880 --> 18:36.283
Okay, Adam,
time to build ya back up!

18:36.316 --> 18:38.017
Are you ready
for the positive take--

18:38.050 --> 18:40.787
Wait... Adam?

18:40.820 --> 18:43.290
Adam?

18:43.323 --> 18:44.691
Adam!

18:46.859 --> 18:49.061
**

18:50.630 --> 18:51.998
Hello, we are behind
the scenes

18:52.031 --> 18:53.032
here on
"Adam Ruins Everything,"

18:53.065 --> 18:54.167
in the boxing gym
to talk more

18:54.201 --> 18:55.202
to Steve Lewandowsky,

18:55.235 --> 18:56.536
'cause I have
way more questions

18:56.569 --> 18:57.970
about his work,
and way more questions

18:58.004 --> 18:58.971
about the backfire
effect.

18:59.005 --> 19:01.474
Do you think
that we as a...

19:01.508 --> 19:03.876
as a society can fight
the backfire effect,

19:03.910 --> 19:05.212
or do you think
it's too powerful?

19:05.245 --> 19:06.479
Well, I think
we have to.

19:06.513 --> 19:08.014
I think we have to
try and do that.

19:08.047 --> 19:09.949
How do we do it?
Well...

19:09.982 --> 19:11.551
on the technological side,

19:11.584 --> 19:13.286
part of the problem
we're having now is that

19:13.320 --> 19:15.888
the public is fractionated

19:15.922 --> 19:17.990
into these
filter bubbles,

19:18.024 --> 19:20.293
because everybody
is getting things

19:20.327 --> 19:22.695
on Amazon or Facebook
that they like.

19:22.729 --> 19:25.232
Yeah.
But, it's not good
for society.

19:25.265 --> 19:26.666
They should also
show me something

19:26.699 --> 19:28.000
I might not like
that much.

19:28.034 --> 19:30.370
Yeah.
And by doing that,
people with different

19:30.403 --> 19:32.171
political views
are still reading

19:32.205 --> 19:33.673
the same book,
at least.

19:33.706 --> 19:34.741
Or at least
we would understand

19:34.774 --> 19:35.908
what each other think.
Exactly.

19:35.942 --> 19:37.477
And, similarly,
you can introduce

19:37.510 --> 19:39.479
some sort of
fact-checking alert

19:39.512 --> 19:41.681
when you're sharing things
on Facebook.

19:41.714 --> 19:43.650
In fact, Facebook
has started doing that.

19:43.683 --> 19:46.319
But won't... won't they
just backfire on Facebook?

19:46.353 --> 19:47.420
Well...
And say, "Wow!

19:47.454 --> 19:48.688
Facebook is in the pocket"
of the whoever.

19:48.721 --> 19:50.857
Well, they might,
but not everybody.

19:50.890 --> 19:52.259
Yeah.
Again, I think
some people

19:52.292 --> 19:53.560
will be susceptible
to that.

19:53.593 --> 19:55.094
In fact, we've done
the research on that,

19:55.127 --> 19:56.996
that if people are warned

19:57.029 --> 19:58.998
that something
might be mistaken

19:59.031 --> 20:00.600
in what they're about
to read,

20:00.633 --> 20:02.535
then they become
much more careful

20:02.569 --> 20:04.404
in how they evaluate
the material.

20:04.437 --> 20:06.439
And another thing
that I love...

20:06.473 --> 20:07.940
there's a Norwegian
website

20:07.974 --> 20:11.511
that has started
giving people a quiz

20:11.544 --> 20:13.513
on the content
of an article

20:13.546 --> 20:15.214
before they can post
a comment.

20:15.248 --> 20:16.449
And if you don't pass
the quiz,

20:16.483 --> 20:18.117
you can't comment.
(laughing)

20:18.150 --> 20:20.019
I love that!
(laughing)

20:20.052 --> 20:21.621
That's not censorship.

20:21.654 --> 20:23.256
All it does
is to make sure...
Yeah.

20:23.290 --> 20:24.624
...that the people
who leave comments

20:24.657 --> 20:26.526
actually know what
they're commenting on.

20:26.559 --> 20:28.461
And it gives people
that extra two minutes

20:28.495 --> 20:31.631
to calm down,
to reflect a little more.

20:31.664 --> 20:33.933
And, I think what
that would do is to...

20:33.966 --> 20:36.135
to improve the quality

20:36.168 --> 20:37.604
of the comment stream
dramatically.

20:37.637 --> 20:39.472
Those are the technological
solutions,

20:39.506 --> 20:41.274
and that's just scratching
the surface.

20:41.308 --> 20:43.042
You know, we can do a hell
of a lot more than that.

20:43.075 --> 20:44.477
Well, now that we're working
on the problem,

20:44.511 --> 20:46.446
I certainly hope we can
move towards a solution.

20:46.479 --> 20:47.914
Yes.
Everyone is worried now

20:47.947 --> 20:49.816
that we're living in
an age of misinformation

20:49.849 --> 20:52.251
which I often think
is maybe a little bit

20:52.285 --> 20:53.486
overblown of an idea...

20:53.520 --> 20:55.455
Do you feel that
we are, or...?

20:55.488 --> 20:59.759
Well, I have looked
at the, uh,

20:59.792 --> 21:02.729
truth ratings
of presidential candidates

21:02.762 --> 21:05.798
over the last, uh,
12 or 16 years,

21:05.832 --> 21:08.935
And if you go to independent
fact-checking websites

21:08.968 --> 21:11.003
like PolitiFact,
and you look

21:11.037 --> 21:14.106
at the campaign scorecards
for candidates

21:14.140 --> 21:16.443
over the last three
or four elections,

21:16.476 --> 21:19.479
it is undoubtedly
the case that the,

21:19.512 --> 21:23.516
uh, level of truth
has declined dramatically.

21:23.550 --> 21:24.651
I mean,
you're not an American.

21:24.684 --> 21:25.652
Do you think it's...
No.

21:25.685 --> 21:26.919
Is it uniquely American,
or...?

21:26.953 --> 21:29.856
No, the United Kingdom
had a similar episode

21:29.889 --> 21:32.291
last year with
the Brexit campaign

21:32.325 --> 21:34.661
where there was
a flood of...

21:34.694 --> 21:38.365
of misinformation.
The real problem there

21:38.398 --> 21:40.199
and also with
the recent election

21:40.232 --> 21:43.503
in the U.S., I think,
is not just

21:43.536 --> 21:45.438
the flood
of misinformation.

21:45.472 --> 21:49.709
It's also that facts seem
to have lost traction.

21:49.742 --> 21:51.678
And, uh, uh...

21:51.711 --> 21:54.280
expertise is now considered
to be elitist.

21:54.313 --> 21:57.350
Education, sometimes
is considered to be elitist.

21:57.384 --> 21:58.351
Yeah.
Ugh.

21:58.385 --> 21:59.852
Sometimes it feels
as though

21:59.886 --> 22:01.888
it's not just that people
are believing the...

22:01.921 --> 22:04.223
the bad facts, but not
believing the good ones,

22:04.256 --> 22:05.692
that everything has
an equal status,

22:05.725 --> 22:07.660
that any piece
of information...
Precisely.

22:07.694 --> 22:09.896
...is as good
as any other.
Precisely, yes.

22:09.929 --> 22:11.631
I really appreciate
you coming on the show.

22:11.664 --> 22:12.732
Thank you so much
for being here.

22:12.765 --> 22:13.733
Thanks so much
for having me.

22:13.766 --> 22:14.734
Yeah.
It's been great.

22:14.767 --> 22:16.436
**

22:17.370 --> 22:19.906
Yeah.
It's been great.

22:19.939 --> 22:21.040
Away.

22:21.073 --> 22:22.642
I don't know
for how long.

22:22.675 --> 22:24.544
I-I'm really sorry
if I hurt your feelings.

22:24.577 --> 22:26.345
It's just, you know how
this show works.

22:26.379 --> 22:27.580
You know,
I prove you wrong,

22:27.614 --> 22:29.181
and it totally sucks,
and then I give you

22:29.215 --> 22:31.518
a positive takeaway
and everything's all better.

22:31.551 --> 22:34.253
Which is why it's time
to tell you that--

22:34.286 --> 22:35.354
Being wrong
is good for you?

22:35.388 --> 22:37.089
(scoffs)
Yeah, I know that.

22:37.123 --> 22:38.324
Y-You do?

22:38.357 --> 22:40.326
Of course!
Finding out you're wrong

22:40.359 --> 22:43.095
is the first step towards
one day being right.

22:43.129 --> 22:44.731
And, people actually
like you more

22:44.764 --> 22:46.165
when they see you
screw up.

22:46.198 --> 22:47.934
It's called
the pratfall effect,

22:47.967 --> 22:49.035
and it's why
every character

22:49.068 --> 22:50.603
in a romantic comedy
is clumsy.

22:51.971 --> 22:54.273
Oh, of all the luck!

22:54.306 --> 22:55.942
Ah, there go my books...

22:55.975 --> 22:58.210
and on
Valentine's Day!

22:58.244 --> 23:00.279
Attractive,
yet approachable.

23:00.312 --> 23:01.414
Not to mention,

23:01.448 --> 23:03.282
admitting your mistakes
builds trust.

23:03.315 --> 23:05.051
Doctors who are honest
about their errors

23:05.084 --> 23:06.453
are actually more likely

23:06.486 --> 23:08.788
to have more trusting
patients, not fewer.

23:08.821 --> 23:11.090
I'm so sorry I amputated
the wrong arm.

23:11.123 --> 23:12.692
Happens to
all of us, Doc.

23:12.725 --> 23:15.294
One time, I left
my car lights on.

23:15.327 --> 23:16.729
Don't worry about it.

23:16.763 --> 23:17.964
So, yeah, I know

23:17.997 --> 23:19.265
that being wrong
is good for you.

23:19.298 --> 23:21.568
It's what I've built
my entire life around.

23:21.601 --> 23:25.104
Oh, um... then why
are you upset?

23:25.137 --> 23:27.974
I'm not.
I'm proud.

23:29.476 --> 23:31.310
The student has become
the teacher.

23:31.343 --> 23:33.580
I don't think
you need me anymore.

23:33.613 --> 23:35.147
Of course I need you!

23:35.181 --> 23:37.116
I mean, you teach me
so much.

23:37.149 --> 23:38.818
Well,
you've taught me too.

23:38.851 --> 23:40.453
From the truth
about IQ tests,

23:40.487 --> 23:41.554
to eyeglasses,

23:41.588 --> 23:43.990
to my personal favorite,
the female hymen!

23:44.023 --> 23:45.157
Mm, don't say it
like that.

23:45.191 --> 23:47.460
Most importantly, Em,
you've taught me

23:47.494 --> 23:49.562
what it means
to have a good friend.

23:49.596 --> 23:51.498
**

23:51.531 --> 23:54.333
Thanks, bud.
You taught me that too.

23:54.366 --> 23:57.003
But today, you also
reminded me that

23:57.036 --> 23:58.971
I still have
a lot to learn.

23:59.005 --> 24:01.173
So, I think it's time
I go see

24:01.207 --> 24:03.142
who else is out there
I can learn from.

24:03.175 --> 24:06.579
And I'm afraid that path...
takes me elsewhere.

24:06.613 --> 24:08.781
**

24:08.815 --> 24:11.684
You don't fly.
You ride a folding bike.

24:11.718 --> 24:13.352
Much more efficient.

24:13.385 --> 24:15.221
Actually, I do both.

24:17.389 --> 24:18.190
**

24:18.224 --> 24:20.927
**

24:20.960 --> 24:23.530
Wait...
where are you going?

24:23.563 --> 24:26.032
Holy crow,
he's really leaving.

24:27.834 --> 24:30.002
(doorbell rings)

24:30.036 --> 24:31.270
Adam?

24:31.303 --> 24:33.372
Hello,
my Internet girlfriend!

24:33.405 --> 24:34.974
Can I live with you?

24:35.007 --> 24:36.843
(whistling)
