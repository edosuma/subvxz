JIM: <i>I just need to know we're off the record.</i>

- HALLIE: <i>That hurts me.</i>
- Hallie.

01:25.587 --> 01:28.006
<i>You believe I would violate our trust</i>
<i>for a story?</i>

01:28.089 --> 01:30.049
I believe you'd sell me into slavery for a story.

01:30.133 --> 01:32.469
<i>- Well, that's just not true.</i>
- Say we're off the record.

01:32.552 --> 01:35.096
<i>- We're always off the record.</i>
- I need it for specifically right now.

01:35.180 --> 01:37.223
<i>- You need me to say the words?</i>
- Yes.

01:37.307 --> 01:38.349
<i>You really need me to say the words?</i>

01:38.433 --> 01:40.101
- Yeah, and you haven't yet.
<i>- Well played.</i>

01:40.185 --> 01:41.186
- Hallie.
<i>- Yeah?</i>

01:41.269 --> 01:44.105
- Say them.
<i>- We're off the record.</i>

01:44.189 --> 01:49.527
Last night, at around 1:30 in the morning,
Charlie, Will and Mac all resigned.

01:49.611 --> 01:51.488
Don and Maggie and I were resigning.

01:51.571 --> 01:53.448
Sloan, Neal was resigning.

01:53.531 --> 01:57.285
<i>I knew you guys... I could tell you guys</i>
<i>were gonna do that all during the depo prep.</i>

01:57.368 --> 01:59.954
<i>Wait, you said "were." Were resigning.</i>

02:00.038 --> 02:02.665
Leona wouldn't accept their resignations.
Charlie, Will and Mac.

02:02.749 --> 02:04.292
<i>- You're kidding.</i>
- No.

02:04.375 --> 02:05.376
<i>Why?</i>

02:05.460 --> 02:07.295
She didn't think it was
the honorable thing to do.

02:07.378 --> 02:09.130
<i>- No, seriously.</i>
- Hallie, I'm telling you,

02:09.214 --> 02:12.008
she won't accept their resignations
and she won't settle the suit.

02:12.091 --> 02:14.511
She wants to do the honorable thing.
Those were her words.

02:14.594 --> 02:17.806
And to her, that means standing by us
and not caving to the pressure.

02:17.889 --> 02:19.557
<i>- This is unprecedented.</i>
- Yeah.

02:19.641 --> 02:21.434
<i>You have to let me quote you on this.</i>

02:21.518 --> 02:23.686
All these years, what did you think
"off the record" meant?

02:23.770 --> 02:25.104
<i>- I'm saying on background.</i>
- No.

02:25.188 --> 02:26.189
Shh!

02:27.816 --> 02:30.693
No. There's no story until Charlie says so.

02:31.986 --> 02:33.822
She'll hold you in material breach.

02:33.905 --> 02:36.407
- Are you just saying that?
- No, she's very serious.

02:36.491 --> 02:38.868
- If we resign anyway, she'll sue us?
- She'll win, too.

02:38.952 --> 02:40.620
- We're trying to do the right thing.
- So is she.

02:40.703 --> 02:42.789
There's a mob out there with pitchforks.

02:42.872 --> 02:44.791
- She doesn't like mobs.
- CHARLIE: What if the mob's right?

02:44.874 --> 02:46.042
REBECCA: They're not.
CHARLIE: Says who?

02:46.125 --> 02:47.669
Me and her.

02:47.752 --> 02:52.465
We aired a story. A small story? No.
A story asserting that we used...

02:52.549 --> 02:54.008
- Sarin gas.
- On civilians.

02:54.092 --> 02:56.511
We retracted the story 48 hours later

02:56.594 --> 02:58.680
because we were a little wrong? No.

02:58.763 --> 03:00.849
- We aired...
- A complete fiction.

03:00.932 --> 03:03.268
- You don't have to be mean about it.
- You aired a bad story.

03:03.351 --> 03:06.020
- It was a great story.
- If only it had been true.

03:06.104 --> 03:08.898
Well, I'm sorry we didn't meet your
East Coast intellectual standards.

03:08.982 --> 03:11.860
- Hey, I'm not fucking around.
- She's not accepting your resignations.

03:11.943 --> 03:13.862
- This place is crippled.
- I understand that...

03:13.945 --> 03:16.573
To start with,
we don't have military sources anymore.

03:16.656 --> 03:19.409
- The DOD doesn't talk to us.
- Do you think that's maybe

03:19.492 --> 03:21.870
because you falsely accused them
of heinous war crimes?

03:21.953 --> 03:23.371
I do. I think that's the reason.

03:23.454 --> 03:27.208
But that's small beer
compared to our public credibility.

03:27.292 --> 03:29.794
- That, your credibility...
- Has disappeared?

03:29.878 --> 03:32.297
- REBECCA: Yes.
- So one less thing we have to worry about.

03:32.380 --> 03:33.590
Why are you jovial?

03:33.673 --> 03:35.550
I've appointed myself in charge of morale.

03:35.633 --> 03:37.468
- CHARLIE: That's what it's come to.
- He's right.

03:37.552 --> 03:41.806
We aired a doctored tape
in support of a fake report.

03:41.890 --> 03:44.767
The guy who doctored the tape is suing us.

03:44.851 --> 03:47.312
The woman who's always wanted
to fire us won't let us resign.

03:47.395 --> 03:50.273
The unhappiest guy in the building
is in charge of morale.

03:50.356 --> 03:52.400
We have gone to the zoo!

03:52.483 --> 03:54.068
- True story.
- Yeah.

03:54.152 --> 03:55.778
Which is more than
we can say about the story.

03:55.862 --> 03:57.071
- That's right.
- But on the bright side...

03:57.155 --> 03:59.198
There is no bright side, Father Flanagan.

03:59.282 --> 04:01.659
- Don't finish that sentence.
- I wasn't gonna be able to anyway.

Reese is having a viewing party upstairs?

04:09.000 --> 04:11.002
Yeah. Look at me.

04:11.085 --> 04:12.670
Why am I looking at you?

04:12.754 --> 04:14.255
Because I'm dressed for the party.

04:14.339 --> 04:16.007
- Got it.
- I look hot.

04:16.090 --> 04:17.926
- I'm gonna go upstairs...
- Liquid sex.

04:18.009 --> 04:19.260
I'm gonna go upstairs and...
What are you saying?

04:19.344 --> 04:22.221
I just described myself as liquid sex.

04:23.097 --> 04:25.099
Add to the list that this is our lawyer.

04:25.183 --> 04:28.144
No kidding.
I'm gonna go upstairs at some point tonight.

04:28.227 --> 04:29.812
- When?
- When there's a minute.

04:29.896 --> 04:31.564
I'm gonna go upstairs and work on Reese.

04:31.648 --> 04:34.359
- You want me to help?
- I'd love you to.

04:34.442 --> 04:38.029
But someone has to endure
the soul-swallowing humiliation

04:38.112 --> 04:42.283
of having their name and face broadcast
next to the ACN logo for the next six hours.

04:42.367 --> 04:45.161
I can't believe you guys didn't
choose him for the morale job.

04:45.244 --> 04:49.082
- I'm gonna need to talk to Don Keefer.
- He's pretty busy right now.

04:49.165 --> 04:50.500
- Later, then.
- Why?

04:50.583 --> 04:54.253
He has attorney/client privilege,
but he's not gonna be happy.

04:55.046 --> 04:56.130
(SIGHS)

04:56.339 --> 04:58.424
All right. Can I have a moment?

04:58.508 --> 04:59.968
Sure.

05:02.136 --> 05:03.721
I think he meant with me.

05:06.015 --> 05:07.392
That wasn't made clear.

- She wanted it to be over.

05:13.940 --> 05:17.110
She thought she was gonna be
humanely put down.

05:17.193 --> 05:20.530
Yeah, she's, you know... She's shaken up.

05:20.613 --> 05:22.448
You can fire her.

05:22.532 --> 05:25.702
You don't need Leona's permission,
and I can't do it without yours.

05:25.785 --> 05:28.162
- And she can't quit.
- I know. I'm not firing anybody.

05:28.246 --> 05:30.039
I'm not firing anybody, either.

05:30.123 --> 05:32.417
I just badly need to get fired myself.

05:32.500 --> 05:34.794
So you'd agree this is an unusual situation?

05:34.877 --> 05:36.796
These things...

05:36.879 --> 05:39.966
Why don't you just set yourself on fire
instead of the cigarette?

05:40.049 --> 05:41.175
One's enjoyable to me

05:41.259 --> 05:42.593
- and the other would cause a lot of pain.
- Oh.

05:42.677 --> 05:45.096
- It's not even a choice.
- Have a good show.

05:45.972 --> 05:47.265

Hutchinson, Kansas, that defies cliché.

06:04.157 --> 06:06.701
The Democratic incumbent,
Jan Pauls, is anti-gay.

06:06.784 --> 06:09.120
- Gay marriage?
- ELLIOT: Gay person, anti-gay.

06:09.203 --> 06:11.706
The Democrat is the state's
leading LGBT opponent.

06:11.789 --> 06:14.250
She narrowly defeated
her primary challenger Erich Bishop,

06:14.333 --> 06:16.627
the openly gay son of a former Klan member.

Tonight, Jan Pauls faces off
against her Republican challenger,

who's a pro-choice, pro-gay rights
railroad conductor named Dakota Bass.

There's no way I'm not spending
the entire night talking about this race.

06:27.680 --> 06:28.723
I am.

06:28.806 --> 06:30.266
- I called it.
- What do you mean you called it?

06:30.349 --> 06:32.018
- I just told you about it.
- Did you call it?

06:32.101 --> 06:34.395
- I...
- No. Right?

06:34.479 --> 06:36.314
I don't want to get in the middle of anything,

06:36.397 --> 06:38.900
but I've always understood
that you had to call it.

06:40.568 --> 06:42.403
I did call...

Okay, it's obviously
every man for himself out there.

06:50.620 --> 06:51.829
Taylor, I know it's your first time,

06:51.913 --> 06:53.706
so don't worry that
you're going to be bad at this.

06:53.790 --> 06:54.916
Not worried, not my first time.

06:54.999 --> 06:56.584
If it turns out that you're bad on TV,

06:56.667 --> 06:58.086
- everyone else can cover for you.
- Cool.

06:58.169 --> 07:00.254
I mean, you'll still have to
sit there for six hours,

07:00.338 --> 07:02.090
- but you'll do it silently.
- Copy.

07:05.218 --> 07:07.512
Vermont, Virginia, Georgia, and Indiana.

07:07.595 --> 07:09.388
And we can call Indiana
and Kentucky for Romney.

07:09.472 --> 07:12.100
- Yeah, baby.
- You are to show no partisan emotion.

07:12.183 --> 07:14.769
And another thing,
I'm not an embed on your bus.

07:14.852 --> 07:16.979
I'm the senior producer
of ACN's election night coverage.

07:17.063 --> 07:20.233

that Jim gave away

a one-on-one with the candidate
to another reporter on the bus.

07:30.910 --> 07:35.081

a special relationship.

- Hallie.
- TAYLOR: I'm sorry?

07:38.626 --> 07:40.336
Yes, he gave it to Hallie.

07:40.419 --> 07:43.631
She's his girlfriend now,
so he's just mad that I ratted him out.

07:43.714 --> 07:45.550
- But I had to.
- I'm Maggie Jordan.

07:46.300 --> 07:47.969
- Hi.
- I hate Jim, too.

07:48.052 --> 07:49.470
- No, you don't.
- MAGGIE: Yes, I do.

07:49.554 --> 07:52.056
- I don't hate Jim.
- I do.

07:54.016 --> 07:57.270
Would it bother Jim
if you knew something before he did?

07:57.353 --> 08:00.731
- It would a lot, yeah.
- Then we can both win.

- It got bid up to $1,000.

Reese had for Sandy relief.

08:38.394 --> 08:40.354
- I was supposed to sign a book.
- You did sign a book.

08:40.438 --> 08:42.023
Reese asked all the talent
to contribute something.

08:42.106 --> 08:44.108
Will donated a round of golf with Will.

08:44.192 --> 08:45.610

08:45.693 --> 08:47.445
And Reese wanted you to
donate dinner and a movie,

08:47.528 --> 08:49.280
but you said you'd sign a book.

08:49.363 --> 08:50.865
Because I thought nobody bidding on a book

08:50.948 --> 08:52.867
would be less embarrassing
than nobody bidding on a date.

08:52.950 --> 08:55.828
NEAL: Do you honestly...
Can I ask, do you seriously think...

08:55.912 --> 08:57.705
I'm not suggesting you
should have donated a date,

08:57.788 --> 09:00.958
but do you really think that if you had,
no one would have bid on it?

09:01.042 --> 09:03.836
What I'm saying is,
that would have been embarrassing.

09:03.920 --> 09:07.215
So, why not just donate the money
directly to Sandy? Which is what I did.

09:07.298 --> 09:09.217
Well, your book went for $1,000.

09:09.300 --> 09:12.220

was your autograph.

- I didn't sign it.
- You did.

for your generosity, Sloan Sabbith."

10:13.739 --> 10:16.492
3% of voters didn't decide until today
who they were voting for.

10:16.575 --> 10:18.619
- How do they break?
- 52-43 Obama.

10:18.703 --> 10:22.123
So, listen, Brody in California
condemned Todd Akin, right?

10:22.206 --> 10:24.375
This morning. Took a special kind
of courage to wait two months.

10:24.458 --> 10:25.876
His pollster must have told him he had to.

10:25.960 --> 10:27.795
- He had a reason not to.
- What?

10:27.878 --> 10:31.299
In 1990, Brody wrote in an SFA publication,

10:31.382 --> 10:33.718
"It's a sad fact, but women cry rape

10:33.801 --> 10:37.847
"to avoid embarrassment, to exact revenge,
or just to draw attention.

10:37.930 --> 10:40.266
"If we have rape exceptions to abortion laws,

10:40.349 --> 10:42.810
"women could now cry rape
to terminate an innocent life.

10:42.893 --> 10:45.271
- "We should be able to look past the..."
- Wow.

10:45.354 --> 10:47.106
"Look past the mendacity.

10:47.189 --> 10:49.692
"Children are conceived by love, not by rape."

10:50.609 --> 10:52.403
- He condemned Akin?
- This is what I'm saying.

10:52.486 --> 10:54.613
- This morning on election night?
- I think you're right.

10:54.697 --> 10:56.824
I think he has a pollster
who looked at undecided women

10:56.907 --> 10:59.160
18-35 and told him he had to roll the dice.

10:59.243 --> 11:00.661
How did you find this quote?

11:00.745 --> 11:02.413
Taylor Warren pointed me to it.

11:02.496 --> 11:04.415
(WHISPERS) She's a Republican.

11:04.498 --> 11:07.501
- Why are you whispering that?
- I love her doing the right thing.

11:07.585 --> 11:08.878
It wasn't so much that

11:08.961 --> 11:10.504
as wanting to give me
something Jim didn't have.

11:10.588 --> 11:12.506
- Ah, so, it's adorable.
- Yeah.

11:12.590 --> 11:13.883
I called his office for comment...

11:13.966 --> 11:16.010
There's not gonna be anyone in his office.
This is election day.

11:16.093 --> 11:17.887
His campaign office, too,
but I didn't get very high up.

11:17.970 --> 11:20.389
Didn't you used to take showers
with his chief of staff?

11:21.098 --> 11:22.725
- John Webb?
- Yeah.

11:22.808 --> 11:24.393
We played tennis.

11:24.477 --> 11:25.770
And then took showers together?

11:26.270 --> 11:28.606
It's... The...

11:28.689 --> 11:31.108
I'm gonna make the call,
but they're individual showers.

11:31.817 --> 11:33.527
- Cool. For privacy.
- (DIALING)

11:33.611 --> 11:35.780
When you cut your hair,
did you want to look like Joey Heatherton

11:35.863 --> 11:37.031
and something went terribly wrong?

11:37.114 --> 11:38.115
- Yep.
- It's ringing.

11:39.116 --> 11:40.117
(BEEPS)

11:40.242 --> 11:41.452
(TELEPHONE RINGING)

11:43.829 --> 11:45.706
- JOHN: <i>Yeah?</i>
- John, it's Don Keefer.

11:45.790 --> 11:48.000
<i>- Tell me some good news.</i>
- (CHUCKLES)

11:48.084 --> 11:49.835
I don't have exits for you.

11:49.919 --> 11:52.505
I need to ask you about something
the congressman wrote

11:52.588 --> 11:55.800
in a Students for America
publication in 1990, okay?

12:00.262 --> 12:01.889
- John?
<i>- Yeah?</i>

12:01.972 --> 12:04.725
He wrote, "It's a sad fact,
but women cry rape."

12:04.809 --> 12:06.102
<i>- Yeah, I know it, Don.</i>
- All right.

12:06.185 --> 12:08.562
Uh, first, can you confirm that it's him?

12:08.646 --> 12:10.231
<i>Okay, Don, I'm gonna call you back, all right?</i>

12:10.314 --> 12:11.899
We're on the air in a few minutes.

12:11.982 --> 12:13.734
<i>Can I get you to hold it</i>
<i>till I talk to some people?</i>

12:13.818 --> 12:15.569
Why would I do that?

12:15.653 --> 12:17.154
<i>I think I can trade you something.</i>

12:20.991 --> 12:23.077
You know we're in no mood
to be fucked around with, right?

12:23.160 --> 12:24.286
<i>I do know, and I'm not.</i>

12:27.498 --> 12:29.583
You have until 8:30 Eastern
or we'll go on the air with

12:29.667 --> 12:30.918
"The congressman's office
declined to comment."

12:31.001 --> 12:32.086
<i>Got it.</i>

12:35.673 --> 12:37.508
What do you think he wants to trade?

12:37.591 --> 12:38.634
I don't know.

12:39.427 --> 12:41.846
Do you think there is any chance
we just got incredibly lucky?

12:42.596 --> 12:44.974
Well, our luck has been outstanding lately.

12:49.145 --> 12:51.188
The first Republican governor
in North Carolina since '88.

12:51.272 --> 12:52.523
We have to throw it to someone.

12:52.606 --> 12:54.900
We can slide five minutes to get...
What's his name? Louden?

12:54.984 --> 12:56.110
- KENDRA: Yeah. Yeah.
- Is it Louden?

12:56.193 --> 12:58.404
MARTIN: First two congressional races,
Maine one for Chellie Pingree

12:58.487 --> 12:59.947
and New York three for Steve Israel.

13:00.030 --> 13:02.408
Decision's saying we'll be able to
call South Carolina four.

13:02.491 --> 13:04.160
- For who?
- I'm sorry?

13:04.243 --> 13:06.579
- South Carolina for who?
- No, we can call South Carolina four.

13:06.662 --> 13:09.081
- WOMAN: Call it for who?
- Costello, Abbott,

13:09.165 --> 13:11.959
South Carolina fourth
congressional district, Trey Gowdy.

13:12.042 --> 13:13.461
- Got it.
- Okay.

13:13.544 --> 13:15.463
- Can you give us a minute?
- Have a good show, guys.

13:15.546 --> 13:17.047
- WOMAN: You, too.
- Good luck.

13:21.385 --> 13:24.180
- The lawyer said she'll hold you in breach?
- Yeah.

13:24.263 --> 13:26.974
- Rebecca?
- Greenway from the general counsel's office.

13:27.057 --> 13:29.268
Said she'd hold you and Charlie
in material breach?

13:29.351 --> 13:30.853
And invoke the non-compete clause.

13:30.936 --> 13:32.313
Why don't we drop it for six hours?

13:32.396 --> 13:33.522
What's Charlie gonna do now?

13:33.606 --> 13:35.858
Reese is having a viewing party
on the 44th floor.

13:35.941 --> 13:38.486
- Charlie's gonna work on him.
- The suit's gonna be filed tomorrow morning.

13:38.569 --> 13:39.987
- Mac.
- That's a public document.

13:40.070 --> 13:42.114
- If we can't get this done tonight...
- I understand.

13:42.198 --> 13:44.492
- If she'll agree to settle tonight...
- I'm with you.

13:44.575 --> 13:46.577
The world doesn't have
to see a list, you know?

13:46.660 --> 13:49.330
A full-on description
of every embarrassing thing

13:49.413 --> 13:50.998
that's gone on here in the last 14 months.

13:51.081 --> 13:52.625
The complaint will cover
more than 14 months.

13:52.708 --> 13:54.210
- But don't worry about it.
- Stop saying that.

13:54.293 --> 13:56.086
Six hours of literally
nothing but breaking news

13:56.170 --> 13:58.255
and you're the traffic cop
at the intersection of all of it.

13:58.380 --> 14:00.299
During light moments, only three people

14:00.382 --> 14:02.843
will be speaking in your ear at once,
but usually it'll be 10.

14:02.927 --> 14:05.012
And I obviously don't have to
say that we need to do well.

14:05.095 --> 14:08.140
That's why my suggestion is
since we can't deal with it right now,

14:08.224 --> 14:10.434
not to worry about it until we're off the air.

14:14.271 --> 14:15.689
- Would you do me a favor?
- Anything.

14:15.773 --> 14:17.066
- I mean this.
- Me, too.

14:17.149 --> 14:18.901
- I'm not fucking around.
- What's the favor?

14:18.984 --> 14:20.277
Say what you want to say to me.

14:21.946 --> 14:23.280
- What?
- Yes.

14:25.115 --> 14:26.450
Then I'll say that I'm alarmed

14:26.534 --> 14:28.702
by how little sleep you've had
and that you're about to go do this.

14:28.786 --> 14:31.038
- That's not what I'm talking about.
- That's what I'm talking about.

14:31.121 --> 14:34.041
You're the most attractive woman
I have ever seen in real life

14:34.124 --> 14:36.043
and I'm sticking by that
statement and everything,

14:36.126 --> 14:38.712
but right now you're not making it easy.
Can you do this?

14:38.796 --> 14:40.214
- Of course I can do this.
- I'm not kidding.

14:40.297 --> 14:41.966
No news producer in America's had sleep.

14:42.049 --> 14:43.842
- They've had some.
- Forget about that.

14:43.926 --> 14:46.428
You look like you were grown in an
environment where it's dark and damp.

14:46.512 --> 14:48.931
Lovely, but I'm talking about Genoa.

14:49.014 --> 14:52.142
Why? We're gonna be
spending plenty of time talking about it.

14:52.226 --> 14:53.852
God knows if we ever take a break,

14:53.936 --> 14:56.730
<i>The New York Times</i> will
keep talking about it for us.

14:56.814 --> 14:58.899
Come on, six hours of live election coverage.

14:58.983 --> 15:01.235
For you and me, that's like an orgy at a spa

15:01.318 --> 15:03.237
where there are college football games on TV

15:03.320 --> 15:05.781
and from the trees hang
Christian Louboutins.

15:05.864 --> 15:08.742
- I feel like...
- All in your size, all different kinds.

15:08.826 --> 15:12.371
Heels like lightsabers.
Boots! Boots are hanging from the trees.

15:12.454 --> 15:14.957
You feel like I'm what?

15:15.040 --> 15:17.084
A bomb that hasn't detonated.

15:18.127 --> 15:20.045
- You do?
- And it's going to.

15:20.129 --> 15:22.715
And I could live without
the element of surprise, so if we could...

15:22.798 --> 15:26.218
- Suede. Lots of suede.
<i>- ...Hurt Locker</i> this thing, it'd be helpful.

15:26.302 --> 15:27.970
I'm not a bomb that's about to explode.

15:28.053 --> 15:29.597
In fact, I didn't want to brag,

15:29.680 --> 15:31.682
but I've been put in charge
of morale for the night.

15:32.600 --> 15:34.518
- By who?
- I did it.

15:35.936 --> 15:39.857
This is the worst situation
you've ever faced in your life, right?

15:39.940 --> 15:41.817
- So far.
- And you'd agree I'm responsible?

15:41.900 --> 15:44.612
I 100% disagree.
Jerry Dantana's responsible.

15:44.695 --> 15:46.947
But I have an idea.
I don't know if you heard,

15:47.031 --> 15:49.533
but I was recently appointed
director of morale for the night.

15:49.617 --> 15:51.160
- Fuck it.
- What do you want from me?

15:51.243 --> 15:53.871
I wanted to know
what the punishment's gonna be this time.

15:53.954 --> 15:55.289
- This time?
- I'll be in the control room.

15:55.372 --> 15:57.207
What was the punishment last time?

15:59.418 --> 16:01.462
- Seriously?
- How have...

16:01.545 --> 16:04.006
There's no one in the world...
You were sleeping with...

16:04.089 --> 16:06.675
- For four months you were...
- I was fucking my ex-boyfriend.

16:06.759 --> 16:07.885
...lying.

16:10.929 --> 16:12.306
And, yeah.

16:12.389 --> 16:14.516
I've never heard you use
that word as a verb before.

16:14.600 --> 16:17.311
- I didn't like how it sounded.
- Wasn't a punishment.

16:17.394 --> 16:20.147
I broke up with you.
You're the only person who's baffled by why.

16:20.230 --> 16:23.233
I've got news for you.
You're the only person who's not baffled

16:23.317 --> 16:25.611
- why it's six years later.
- I'm unforgiving?

16:25.694 --> 16:27.738
So you'll understand my concern
when it comes to Genoa

16:27.821 --> 16:30.324
and wrecking your professional life, too,
which, let's face it,

16:30.407 --> 16:32.618
you take more seriously
than your personal life anyway.

16:32.701 --> 16:34.953
- I'll try to figure out why.
- So what's in store?

16:35.037 --> 16:36.955
You know what, hon?
Can I just say fuck you?

16:37.039 --> 16:39.375
- Yeah.
- I've never punished you.

in less time than it's taking you...

is the right amount of time?

16:51.178 --> 16:53.013
Twenty-eight months.

You seriously came up with a number?

16:55.974 --> 16:57.434
I was kidding.

16:58.644 --> 17:00.062
- Time?
- Yeah.

19:27.835 --> 19:30.712
of Election Night 2012 begins right now.

19:30.796 --> 19:34.758
I'm joined in the studio
by ACN's Sloan Sabbith and Elliot Hirsch,

19:34.842 --> 19:36.343
as well as Republican strategist

19:36.426 --> 19:39.263
and former Romney campaign
press advisor Taylor Warren.

19:39.346 --> 19:41.682
Standing by in Washington is Jane Barrow

19:41.765 --> 19:43.517
<i>and her team of political analysts.</i>

19:43.600 --> 19:45.727
<i>- It's just past 7:00 p.m. in the East...</i>
- Mac.

19:45.811 --> 19:47.980
<i>- and polls have closed in Kentucky...</i>
- Change it up.

19:48.063 --> 19:49.022
- (MUSIC PLAYING)
<i>- ...South Carolina, Vermont,</i>

19:49.106 --> 19:50.440
<i>Virginia and Indiana.</i>

19:50.524 --> 19:54.903
In the battleground state of Virginia,
ACN is projecting that race too close to call.

19:54.987 --> 19:57.447
ACN can project that the great state of Indiana

19:57.531 --> 20:00.117
and its 11 electoral votes
will go to Mitt Romney.

20:00.200 --> 20:03.036
We can also project
that Mitt Romney will be the winner

20:03.120 --> 20:05.372
of Kentucky's eight electoral votes.

20:05.455 --> 20:07.791
We will not have a shutout,
as President Obama...

20:07.875 --> 20:09.543
We're calling Bernie Sanders.

20:09.626 --> 20:11.461
...three electoral votes, making this

20:11.545 --> 20:14.756
the sixth presidential election
in a row for the state to vote blue.

20:14.840 --> 20:17.092
- (BROADCAST CONTINUES)
- (INDISTINCT CHATTER)

20:19.136 --> 20:20.721
MAN: Look right here. Great.

20:20.804 --> 20:22.389
There's a ballot initiative in L.A. County

20:22.472 --> 20:26.018
that would require actors
in adult films to wear condoms.

20:26.101 --> 20:28.270
I've never been more indifferent
to an issue in my life.

20:28.353 --> 20:30.522
- Charlie.
- Excuse me for interrupting.

20:30.606 --> 20:32.190
You're not. This is Denise, Pam, and Connor.

20:32.274 --> 20:34.067
We went to school together.
This is Charlie Skinner.

20:34.151 --> 20:36.653
- He's the president of ACN.
- Any predictions?

20:36.737 --> 20:38.155
Their phones were taken at the door.

20:38.238 --> 20:39.907
Obama's gonna take Virginia

20:39.990 --> 20:43.493
and we've been looking hard
at some precincts in Ohio and Florida.

20:43.577 --> 20:46.330
- Got a minute?
- Excuse me.

20:48.749 --> 20:50.167
- How you doing?
- Hi, Reese.

20:50.250 --> 20:52.002
You understand the suit's
gonna be filed in the morning.

20:52.085 --> 20:53.128
Yeah.

20:53.211 --> 20:55.589
And you understand everyone,
and I mean everyone...

20:55.672 --> 20:59.051
Everyone will have a stringer
waiting at the clerk's office for the complaint.

20:59.134 --> 21:00.552
- Yes.
- You've read a complaint.

21:00.636 --> 21:04.056
It's a long list of grievances
that go well beyond the scope

21:04.139 --> 21:06.934
- of any rational definition of relevance.
- Yes, sir.

21:07.017 --> 21:10.687
Tomorrow's just an exercise
in public shaming.

21:10.771 --> 21:12.272
Yeah, we're gonna be
painted with humiliation,

21:12.356 --> 21:13.815
mostly you and Will
and then Mac and a little bit me.

21:13.899 --> 21:16.693
So you don't feel you're foggy on the reality?

21:16.777 --> 21:18.904
I wish I were less aware of the reality.

21:18.987 --> 21:20.155
- I'd like to be stupid right now.
- Good.

21:20.238 --> 21:21.698
- Charlie.
- Let me finish.

21:21.782 --> 21:23.659
Aren't you the final arbiter
of whether a race gets called?

21:23.742 --> 21:24.826
- Yeah.
- Shouldn't you be downstairs?

21:24.910 --> 21:26.578
That's how important it is

21:26.662 --> 21:29.831
that I convince you
to accept my resignation and Will's.

21:29.915 --> 21:31.583
I think the election is pretty important.

21:31.667 --> 21:34.670
We're waiting for the next exit poll dump.
I've got a minute.

21:35.420 --> 21:39.466
People have been fired for making
much smaller mistakes than we did.

21:39.549 --> 21:41.593
People have been incarcerated
for making smaller mistakes.

21:41.677 --> 21:44.972
So there's that,
and that's bred resentment in the industry.

21:45.055 --> 21:46.848
- But that's nothing. Forget that.
- Okay.

21:46.932 --> 21:50.686
Forget that everything
that's gone on inside the organization

21:50.769 --> 21:54.439
will be laid out on a table
for everyone to scrutinize,

21:54.523 --> 21:57.275
which, sure as we're standing here,
is what is going to happen.

21:57.359 --> 21:58.568
- Forget that.
- All right.

21:58.652 --> 22:01.196
If a news outlet doesn't have credibility,

22:01.279 --> 22:04.032
it doesn't matter what else it has.
That's a fact.

22:04.116 --> 22:08.495
There are people here
from Jane Barrow, Terry Smith,

22:08.578 --> 22:11.581
everyone at the D.C. bureau to Sloan Sabbith,

22:11.665 --> 22:13.750
Elliot Hirsch, everyone on <i>DaySide,</i>

22:13.834 --> 22:17.004
these people don't deserve
to have a piano strapped to their back.

22:17.087 --> 22:19.131
Their credibility shouldn't...

22:20.590 --> 22:23.427
- When did you arrive here?
- I'm stealthy.

22:24.594 --> 22:26.138
(STAMMERING)

22:27.097 --> 22:29.516
I think it's commendable and pretty shocking

22:29.599 --> 22:31.852
that you want to do something just
because it's the right thing to do,

22:31.935 --> 22:33.353
but it's not the right thing to do.

22:33.437 --> 22:34.855
- I know.
- What do you mean?

22:34.938 --> 22:37.357
I think you were responsible
for a massive fuckup.

22:37.441 --> 22:39.234
I think Will was the face of a massive fuckup.

22:39.317 --> 22:42.946
I think firing a mid-level producer
appears to be an abdication of responsibility.

22:43.030 --> 22:45.115
Now we're gonna have to read about
Jim and Maggie and Don

22:45.198 --> 22:47.075
and Jim and Maggie and Don,
and Maggie and Mac and Will,

22:47.159 --> 22:48.994
and did Sloan punch a guy in the face?

22:49.077 --> 22:51.496
- Yeah.
- The train, she is wrecked.

22:51.580 --> 22:52.998
Why are you gleeful?

22:53.081 --> 22:55.292
I'm on the right team for once
and I get really paid.

22:57.961 --> 22:58.962
Are you saying you agree?

22:59.046 --> 23:01.548
I think your resignation
should be accepted immediately

23:01.631 --> 23:03.383
and we should write Dantana a check
and get to the business

23:03.467 --> 23:05.302
of rebooting this once-respected brand.

23:05.385 --> 23:07.471
Then why don't you?

23:07.554 --> 23:09.139
My mom says I can't.

23:09.222 --> 23:11.224
- Reese!
- (SIGHS) I don't know how else to put it.

23:11.308 --> 23:13.477
I talked to her for hours today.
I've been talking to her all night.

23:13.602 --> 23:16.229
I said, "Mom, you're gonna die and
I'm gonna take over a dinged-up company."

23:16.313 --> 23:18.190
And you know what she said?
She said, "I'm never gonna die.

23:18.273 --> 23:19.733
"And when are you gonna
give me some grandchildren?

23:19.816 --> 23:21.485
"Are you gay?
If you're gay, that's fine. Just tell me."

23:21.568 --> 23:23.153
- I said, "I'm not gay."
- Look.

23:23.236 --> 23:24.321
"I just haven't met the right woman yet."

23:24.404 --> 23:25.530
She's like, "Oh, that's bullshit.

23:25.614 --> 23:28.575
"You met the right woman three or four times.
You just always find some problem."

23:28.658 --> 23:30.160
And I was like, "You're divorced."

23:30.243 --> 23:31.703
- And she said, "That's completely different."
- Reese.

23:31.787 --> 23:33.580
I was like,
"What's your obsession with grandchildren?

23:33.663 --> 23:35.040
- "Is it a chance for a do-over?"
- Reese!

23:40.295 --> 23:43.048
She's not taking your resignations.

23:43.131 --> 23:44.925
She's not settling the suit.

23:45.008 --> 23:47.260
- I have to go.
- Charlie, I know.

23:48.136 --> 23:49.805
And I tried.

23:49.888 --> 23:52.015
You have to keep trying.

23:52.099 --> 23:53.225
Tomorrow's too late.

23:57.854 --> 24:00.982
It'd be a lot easier for me to convince
my mother if you agreed with me.

24:01.066 --> 24:03.193
- But I don't.
- Yeah.

24:03.276 --> 24:04.986
You were paying me
for that whole conversation.

24:05.070 --> 24:06.113
I know.

24:07.489 --> 24:11.118
WILL: It's 7:59 in the East
and we're ready to make some calls.

24:11.243 --> 24:12.953
ACN is projecting that Governor Romney

24:13.036 --> 24:15.413
is the winner in the
Mountaineer State of West Virginia.

24:15.497 --> 24:17.040
<i>We can also project at this hour</i>

24:17.124 --> 24:21.378
<i>that President Obama will win in Connecticut,</i>
<i>Delaware, and Washington, D.C.</i>

24:21.586 --> 24:26.174
No surprise here. The 20 electoral votes
from the President's home state of Illinois

24:26.258 --> 24:29.302
are safely Mr. Obama's,
while the 10 electoral votes

24:29.386 --> 24:31.930
from Mitt Romney's home state
of Massachusetts

24:32.013 --> 24:34.224
are also going to, uh, Mr. Obama.

24:34.307 --> 24:37.352
I apologize.
I was trapped by my own sentence structure.

24:37.435 --> 24:38.687
<i>In Maryland...</i>

24:38.770 --> 24:40.564
Six calls plus five Senate calls.

24:40.647 --> 24:43.608
You're gonna give me the calls, then
a quick board on which are too close to call.

24:43.692 --> 24:45.735
Forty-five seconds for
the impact for the Latino vote.

24:45.819 --> 24:48.363
The jobs, national security, the 47%...

24:48.446 --> 24:49.823
We've got Elliot coming up
in the top half hour.

24:49.906 --> 24:51.992
D.C., are you standing by
for the Senate calls?

24:52.075 --> 24:53.493
That's if the Senate turns red.

24:53.577 --> 24:55.370
- Just a nonviolent coup.
<i>- ...Obama off to a good start.</i>

24:55.453 --> 24:57.247
<i>A lot of those states are starting to fill in blue.</i>

24:57.330 --> 24:59.749
We'll take care of business,
do the calls, the House races,

24:59.833 --> 25:02.961
and then I'll give you two minutes
for the 47% after Elliot.

25:03.712 --> 25:05.839
- Where is he?
<i>- He's up in his suite.</i>

25:05.922 --> 25:08.175
There's a lot of family,
all the boys, grandkids.

25:08.258 --> 25:10.719
<i>- What's the general mood?</i>
- You know you've got a reporter here.

25:10.802 --> 25:12.012
<i>- He's busy.</i>
- So am I.

25:12.095 --> 25:13.513
<i>- What's the mood?</i>
- Really good.

25:13.597 --> 25:15.640
It's a party here.
They think they're gonna win Ohio

25:15.724 --> 25:17.142
and then run the table. Are they?

25:17.225 --> 25:18.852
- I don't know anything you don't know.
<i>- Bullshit.</i>

25:18.935 --> 25:20.103
Do you know anything I don't know?

25:20.187 --> 25:21.396
<i>- You'd hate that, right?</i>
- No.

25:21.479 --> 25:23.148
I'd be really happy for you.
Why do people think that...

25:23.231 --> 25:26.026
Hey, four quick things.
First, I'm gonna break news tonight.

25:26.109 --> 25:27.861
MAGGIE: <i>Second, nah-nah-nah-nah.</i>

25:27.944 --> 25:30.197
<i>- Third, hey, Hallie.</i>
<i>- Hey, Maggie.</i>

25:30.947 --> 25:33.909
And fourth, suck it,
and we're about to get a data dump.

25:33.992 --> 25:37.037
<i>- I really like your hair.</i>
<i>- Thanks. That's sweet.</i>

25:37.120 --> 25:39.414
<i>- Good luck tonight.</i>
<i>- Thanks.</i>

25:40.373 --> 25:41.833
- I've got to go.
- Wait.

25:41.917 --> 25:43.084
<i>- What?</i>
- What happened?

25:43.168 --> 25:44.711
- What do you mean?
<i>- To Maggie's hair.</i>

25:44.794 --> 25:46.546
She cut it, I guess, and changed the color.

25:46.630 --> 25:49.216
- You guess she changed the color?
<i>- It was a different color before.</i>

25:49.299 --> 25:51.426
Yes, it was.
Do you know what color my hair is?

25:51.509 --> 25:52.844
<i>You're looking at it right now.</i>

25:52.928 --> 25:54.179
Your hair is the color of goodness.

25:54.262 --> 25:55.972
<i>- You're an idiot.</i>
- It's hazelnut.

25:56.056 --> 25:58.558
<i>That's not a... When did she cut her hair?</i>

25:58.642 --> 25:59.893
- Last week.
<i>- Why?</i>

25:59.976 --> 26:01.978
- I didn't ask.
<i>- You should.</i>

26:02.646 --> 26:04.773
I'll put that on the list
and I'll talk to you in a while.

26:04.856 --> 26:06.942
<i>- My hair's blonde.</i>
- It's really nice.

26:07.025 --> 26:08.151
<i>Goodbye.</i>

26:13.073 --> 26:15.700
<i>- Recapping the earlier...</i>
- All right, you're up.

26:17.160 --> 26:18.620
<i>Be yourself.</i>

26:18.703 --> 26:22.082
You're a great guy
and the people at home really like you.

26:22.165 --> 26:24.709
- Thank you.
<i>- And you're handsome, too,</i>

26:24.793 --> 26:27.170
<i>in a droll and expressionless way.</i>

26:27.254 --> 26:29.673

<i>It's all about locating your inner cha</i>

- Have you located the cha?

<i>Will, through these doors</i>
<i>is our decision desk,</i>

26:45.855 --> 26:47.649
<i>which is the entire brain of the operation.</i>

26:48.024 --> 26:50.694
There are eight experts.

26:50.777 --> 26:54.906
PhDs in statistics, economics,
and political science,

26:54.990 --> 26:57.450
and they use computer models
to combine raw votes,

26:57.534 --> 27:01.288
exit polls, sample precincts, and early voting

27:01.371 --> 27:03.415
to project the winners
in each district and state.

27:03.498 --> 27:05.417
This is Kathy Ling.

27:05.500 --> 27:07.294
<i>Kathy, can you tell us anything new?</i>

27:07.377 --> 27:09.838
<i>- No, not yet.</i>
- This is some good television.

27:10.797 --> 27:15.468
The men and women in here are monitoring
nearly 500 races.

27:15.552 --> 27:18.179
(ATTEMPTS TO SPEAK GERMAN)

27:21.725 --> 27:24.227
Not as well as you think. Come with me.

27:24.311 --> 27:25.645
Shit.

27:26.980 --> 27:29.316
The reason for the seclusion
is that we don't want them

27:29.399 --> 27:31.526
to be influenced by calls
that are being made by other networks.

27:31.609 --> 27:34.154
When our team here is ready to make a call,

27:34.237 --> 27:36.823
they put it into a program called iNews.

27:36.906 --> 27:38.950
- Anything?
- It takes a little time.

27:39.034 --> 27:40.702
- Okay. Uh...
- Yeah!

27:40.785 --> 27:42.662
<i>As I said,</i>
<i>they put the information into iNews,</i>

27:42.746 --> 27:45.290
where it's picked up by one of our producers

27:45.373 --> 27:47.959
at these two desks.

27:48.084 --> 27:54.507
They've divided up the races alphabetically,
and each is responsible for 120 races.

MACKENZIE: After the next commercial,
we'll come back for panel.

but so is over 65.

I'd say three minutes. You good?

Happy as a cat with kittens.

28:03.058 --> 28:04.517
- You've been doing great.
- Thank you.

that you were president of the Oxford Union.

You had to have been
one of the first women presidents, right?

28:13.360 --> 28:15.195
- Cambridge.
- TAYLOR: I'm sorry?

28:15.278 --> 28:17.030
I was president of the Cambridge Union.

Oh. Uh-oh. Sorry. That was Wikipedia.

28:19.657 --> 28:21.117
Wikipedia says I went to Oxford?

28:21.201 --> 28:23.203
- I think I'm remembering right.
- Mac.

28:25.830 --> 28:27.707
You're pitching a perfect game.
Let this one go.

28:27.791 --> 28:29.125
You don't think I can let it go?

28:29.209 --> 28:30.502
- I wasn't challenging you.
- Oh, I'll let it go.

28:30.585 --> 28:32.087
Either way, it's a big honor.

28:32.170 --> 28:33.797
Yes, though not either way. Just one way.

28:34.798 --> 28:36.216
- Right.
- Okay.

28:36.758 --> 28:39.010
- Can I see you when you're done?
- NEAL: Sure.

28:39.094 --> 28:40.720
- Gary signed your book.
- Here's the thing.

28:40.804 --> 28:42.097
- Yeah?
- You forgot to do it

28:42.180 --> 28:44.307
and I was put in charge of
something for the benefit.

28:44.391 --> 28:46.059
And I speak a little German, so I thought,

28:46.142 --> 28:48.103
"I'll inscribe it, 'I hope you enjoy this book."'

28:48.186 --> 28:49.938
And I signed your name just like you do.

28:50.021 --> 28:51.481
I didn't put a heart over the "I" or anything.

28:53.400 --> 28:55.819
Wait, is there an "I" in your name? Yes.

28:57.404 --> 28:58.446
Yes, there is.

28:58.530 --> 29:00.490
And you inscribed it,
"I hope you shred this book."

29:00.573 --> 29:02.325
Neal has explained that. What are the chances

29:02.409 --> 29:03.827
that whoever bought the book
speaks German?

29:03.910 --> 29:05.245
What are the chances that you do?

29:05.328 --> 29:06.955
Guys, can we move this someplace else?

29:07.038 --> 29:09.165
I don't care about the German.
I care about the fraud.

29:09.249 --> 29:12.627
I need the name and contact information
of the person who bought the book.

29:12.710 --> 29:14.879
- Tonight?
- You need to hurry before the trail gets cold.

29:14.963 --> 29:18.591
You think the book may have
been bought by a bank robber?

29:18.675 --> 29:20.218
- Look at my face.
- I know.

29:20.301 --> 29:23.054
- Does it seem like I want to be sassed?
- It does not.

29:23.138 --> 29:25.932
- "Enjoy" is <i>zerreißen.</i>
- That's still "shred."

29:26.015 --> 29:28.393
<i>We'll go back to Will McAvoy</i>
<i>at the anchor desk. Will?</i>

29:28.476 --> 29:32.188
We'll be back with more of ACN's coverage
of Election Night 2012 right after this.

29:32.272 --> 29:33.273
(MUSIC PLAYING)

29:33.356 --> 29:36.025
JAKE: Out.
HERB: Two minutes back.

29:36.109 --> 29:37.610
You wanted me?

29:37.694 --> 29:39.112
I just wanted to check in on the site.

29:39.195 --> 29:40.947
We're doing fine. Everybody's doing fine.

29:41.030 --> 29:44.284
Except Sloan who's flipping out
because somebody bought her book

29:44.367 --> 29:46.744
at the Sandy auction on Sunday
and it wasn't really signed by her.

29:46.828 --> 29:48.788
It's funny the things people try to control

29:48.872 --> 29:50.790
when they feel like they're not in control.
(CHUCKLES)

29:51.458 --> 29:52.542
I wasn't really listening.

29:52.625 --> 29:54.961
- I need you to change my Wikipedia page.
- Sure.

29:55.044 --> 29:57.964
I checked and for some reason,
it says I was President of the Oxford Union.

29:58.047 --> 29:59.382
- Weren't you?
- No.

29:59.466 --> 30:01.801
- I went to Cambridge.
- Right. I knew that.

30:01.885 --> 30:03.970
Do you know who else went to Cambridge?

30:04.053 --> 30:06.222
John Milton, Charles Darwin,

30:06.306 --> 30:08.308
Jane Goodall, Alan Turing,

30:08.391 --> 30:09.851
E.M. Forster, Stephen Hawking,

30:09.934 --> 30:12.020
the King of Jordan, Prime Minister of India,

30:12.103 --> 30:15.106
and three signatories
to the Declaration of Independence.

30:15.190 --> 30:16.941
<i>Mac, I wonder if you can switch me off.</i>

30:17.025 --> 30:18.818
<i>You're screaming names</i>
<i>of smart people in my ear.</i>

30:18.902 --> 30:20.570
- Sorry.
<i>- They teach you that at Oxford?</i>

30:23.156 --> 30:24.949
- So you'll get that fixed?
- Yeah.

30:26.701 --> 30:28.661
- You hear anything back yet?
- No.

30:28.745 --> 30:30.580
It's 8:15. They've got 15 minutes.

30:30.663 --> 30:33.333
Do you really think your shower buddy
has got a story or is he stalling?

30:33.416 --> 30:34.834
I really think he has a story.

30:36.377 --> 30:37.670
HERB: Fifteen seconds.

30:37.754 --> 30:39.589
All right, we're coming back with the 47%.

30:40.256 --> 30:41.633
You guys ready to have some fun?

30:41.716 --> 30:43.426
- Yeah.
- Okay.

30:43.510 --> 30:46.554
No, no. Are you ready to have some fun?

30:48.556 --> 30:50.308
- What the hell is wrong with...
- I don't know.

30:50.391 --> 30:52.602
In three, two, roll in.

30:52.894 --> 30:54.729
(MUSIC PLAYING)

30:55.271 --> 30:59.192
<i>Welcome back to ACN's continuing coverage</i>
<i>of Election Night 2012.</i>

30:59.275 --> 31:01.486
<i>Let's check in with Florida,</i>
<i>where it's still too close to call.</i>

31:02.362 --> 31:04.697
We have 62% of the vote counted

31:04.781 --> 31:06.741
and you can see the President
has an advantage

31:06.824 --> 31:10.787
in that very important battleground state
of roughly 100,000 votes.

31:10.870 --> 31:13.373
Florida, once again,
too close to call at the moment.

31:13.456 --> 31:15.500
Taylor Warren, what effect, if any,

31:15.583 --> 31:18.211
did the 47% tape have
on the Romney campaign

31:18.294 --> 31:19.712
and on the electorate?

31:19.796 --> 31:21.714
The biggest effect it had was on the media.

31:21.798 --> 31:22.882
Now we're talking.

31:29.264 --> 31:31.432
- Oh, hi.
- Hello.

31:31.516 --> 31:33.768
I was just leaving you a note
that I need a minute.

31:35.270 --> 31:36.896
- Am I being sued again?
- Yeah.

31:38.982 --> 31:40.066
Okay, well, what?

31:40.149 --> 31:42.151
You're going to be a named defendant

31:42.235 --> 31:45.238
in a separate suit filed tomorrow morning
by Jerry Dantana.

31:45.321 --> 31:48.658
He's seeking an additional $20 million
for tortious interference.

31:52.161 --> 31:53.204
What's happening?

31:54.455 --> 31:58.585
Shortly after Jerry left ACN,
he applied for a job at Kickstarter.

31:58.668 --> 32:02.255
I'm sure he was advised to demonstrate
that due to his wrongful termination here,

32:02.338 --> 32:04.507
it's now impossible for him
to get work elsewhere.

32:04.591 --> 32:08.303
A man named Goldman,
Ezra Goldman, called you

32:08.386 --> 32:10.263
- about a reference for Jerry?
- Mmm-hmm.

32:10.346 --> 32:11.681
And what did you say?

32:11.764 --> 32:14.350
I said, "Ezra, this is the call
I've been waiting my whole life for."

32:14.434 --> 32:15.852
- What else?
- I told him the story.

32:15.935 --> 32:18.146
I told him Jerry knowingly
put a false story on the air

32:18.229 --> 32:20.315
about Marines murdering
civilians with sarin gas.

32:20.398 --> 32:21.858
- Anything else?
- Probably.

32:22.567 --> 32:23.651
Think.

32:24.360 --> 32:26.613
I said, "If your company needs
a very hardworking sociopath,

32:26.696 --> 32:27.739
"then Jerry's your man."

32:27.822 --> 32:29.324
- Right there.
- No, he's a hardworking guy.

32:29.407 --> 32:32.118
Under New York state law,
tortious interference results

32:32.201 --> 32:34.704
if you intentionally interfere with
a potential business relationship

32:34.787 --> 32:36.331
by acting solely out of malice

32:36.414 --> 32:39.083
or through improper or dishonest means.

32:39.208 --> 32:40.501
- Wait.
- Sure.

32:40.585 --> 32:42.920
He's suing me for giving him
a bad job recommendation?

32:43.004 --> 32:44.422
For saying something that wasn't true.

32:44.505 --> 32:45.840
It's not a dispute he doctored the tape.

32:45.923 --> 32:47.967
And if all you said was that, you'd be fine.

32:48.051 --> 32:49.469
But you called him a sociopath.

32:49.552 --> 32:52.388
- He is.
- Sociopath is a clinical term.

32:52.472 --> 32:54.974
How much training
as a psychiatric diagnostician

32:55.058 --> 32:57.268
did you get at
the Columbia School of Journalism?

32:57.352 --> 32:59.520
- Not that much.
- Yeah.

32:59.604 --> 33:02.231
So, you see, you've got to talk to me
before you say things.

33:02.315 --> 33:03.900
It was plainly not...

33:05.193 --> 33:07.278
I didn't say he's a sociopath.

33:07.362 --> 33:09.989
- What did you say?
- I said, you know...

33:10.073 --> 33:11.908
I said, "Ezra, he's a sociopath."

33:11.991 --> 33:13.493
- Yeah.
- Why in the world... In the world!

33:13.576 --> 33:15.036
...would he put me down as a reference?

33:15.119 --> 33:16.704
So that this would happen.

33:19.832 --> 33:22.001
Is this a joke?
You making one of your funny jokes?

33:22.085 --> 33:23.836
If I was joking, you'd be laughing.
Are you laughing?

33:23.920 --> 33:26.005
- No.
- Then there you have it.

33:26.089 --> 33:28.174
- I just answered the phone.
- It's just strategy.

33:28.257 --> 33:30.259
- They want the company to settle.
- How much is this gonna cost?

33:30.343 --> 33:32.011
Well, if you lose, $20 million.

33:32.095 --> 33:33.680
If you win,
only a couple of hundred thousand.

33:33.763 --> 33:35.056
I don't have a couple of hundred thousand.

33:35.139 --> 33:37.725
- Do you own your apartment or rent?
- I own it.

33:37.809 --> 33:39.560
Second mortgage. Problem solved.

33:41.646 --> 33:45.024
You are a member of a godless,
soulless race of extortionists.

33:47.610 --> 33:48.945
That's fair.

33:52.156 --> 33:53.282
Okay.

33:54.450 --> 33:57.954
TAYLOR: The liberal media bias is so clear
that it's not worth arguing about.

33:58.037 --> 33:59.580
What I'd like to focus on instead...

33:59.664 --> 34:02.542
Hang on just a second, 'cause I don't think
I can let you float an allegation

34:02.625 --> 34:05.878
like that and then pretend
it's so well agreed upon that it's past debate.

34:05.962 --> 34:09.382
The media overwhelmingly voted
for and is voting for Obama.

34:09.465 --> 34:11.384
I have a hunch
this isn't gonna be the last time

34:11.467 --> 34:14.178
I ask you this tonight,
but any evidence for that?

34:14.262 --> 34:18.266
Yes. A survey conducted
by the American Society of Newspaper Editors

34:18.349 --> 34:21.227
showed 61% stated
that they were members of

34:21.310 --> 34:23.438
or shared the beliefs of the Democratic Party,

34:23.521 --> 34:27.817
<i>while 15% said that their beliefs were best</i>
<i>supported by the Republican Party.</i>

34:28.192 --> 34:29.569
Can I raise what I think

34:29.652 --> 34:31.320
- is an interesting example of something?
- Sure.

34:31.404 --> 34:33.364
In a race for the Kansas State Legislature...

34:33.448 --> 34:35.700
- ELLIOT: Oh, seriously?
- ...the Democrat is an anti-gay,

34:35.783 --> 34:37.869
- anti-abortion train conductor.
- Nope.

34:37.952 --> 34:40.830
Pardon me.
The Republican is a train conductor and gay.

34:40.913 --> 34:41.914
- No.
- Guys.

34:41.998 --> 34:43.875
<i>Somebody's a train conductor,</i>

34:43.958 --> 34:46.711
<i>somebody's gay</i>
<i>and somebody's father is in the Klan.</i>

34:46.794 --> 34:48.254
And what's that an example of?

34:49.338 --> 34:50.339
Elliot?

34:50.423 --> 34:55.178
Nothing. So, Taylor, back to your point
and your 15-year-old survey.

34:58.055 --> 34:59.098
- Jim.
- Yeah?

34:59.182 --> 35:00.933
They want you at the decision desk.

35:07.356 --> 35:08.441
Somebody need me?

35:08.524 --> 35:10.109
Will called the Michigan first
for Dan Benishek?

35:10.193 --> 35:11.444
If you called it, he called it.

35:11.527 --> 35:13.279
We didn't call it and he called it.

35:13.362 --> 35:14.655
What are you talking about?

35:14.739 --> 35:16.574
In the scroll, you've got
Michigan one going red

35:16.657 --> 35:18.785
and we haven't called Michigan one.

35:19.619 --> 35:20.870
Hang on.

35:22.955 --> 35:24.290
- Maggie.
- Yeah?

35:24.373 --> 35:26.417
You remember a few minutes ago
when my iNews was overloaded

35:26.501 --> 35:28.211
and I wrote down some calls on a legal pad?

35:28.294 --> 35:30.630
- It's right here.
- What did I say?

35:30.713 --> 35:32.924
New Hampshire one, North Carolina three,

35:33.007 --> 35:34.300
Ohio seven, Michigan one.

35:34.383 --> 35:35.593
Can I see that?

35:39.347 --> 35:41.307
That's supposed to be Mississippi.

35:41.390 --> 35:43.309
- It's MI.
- Yeah.

35:43.392 --> 35:46.270
MI is Michigan.

35:46.354 --> 35:48.439
Martin, can you get Kathy Ling out here?

35:48.523 --> 35:49.482
You have to go in there.

35:49.565 --> 35:50.858
I can't have this
particular conversation in there.

35:50.942 --> 35:51.943
- What happened?
- Can you get her?

35:52.026 --> 35:54.737
- She's not allowed out...
- Blindfold her.

35:57.323 --> 35:58.324
(DOOR OPENS)

35:58.407 --> 36:01.160
Just very quickly, my fault or your fault?

36:01.244 --> 36:03.079
- Assigning blame isn't the productive...
- Good.

36:03.162 --> 36:04.831
- I meant Mississippi.
- That's MISS.

36:04.914 --> 36:06.332
- It certainly is.
- Michigan's MI.

36:06.415 --> 36:08.292
That's why I gave them Michigan. MI one red.

36:09.627 --> 36:10.753
Come on.

36:10.837 --> 36:12.088
MARTIN: Careful.

36:12.171 --> 36:13.881
- So, Kathy.
- Yes.

36:13.965 --> 36:16.759
Over here. We made a small mistake.

36:16.843 --> 36:19.345
We called Michigan
when we meant Mississippi.

36:19.428 --> 36:21.430
- You have to retract it.
- JIM: I wonder...

36:21.514 --> 36:22.515
It's not ready to call.

36:22.598 --> 36:24.809
I wonder if maybe it's not necessary to retract.

36:24.892 --> 36:28.062
It's both too close and too early to call.
You have to retract it.

36:28.145 --> 36:30.356
Let me ask you something
just out of curiosity.

36:30.439 --> 36:33.067
What does your data say
about the Michigan first?

36:33.150 --> 36:34.777
- Republican incumbent...
- Over here.

36:36.362 --> 36:39.198
- Republican incumbent...
- You can just take that off.

36:39.282 --> 36:40.575
Don't look at the monitors.

36:41.868 --> 36:43.369
Dan Benishek will keep his seat.

36:43.452 --> 36:44.829
- You're confident of that?
- Yes.

36:44.912 --> 36:46.289
- Scale of one to 10.
- Ten.

36:47.456 --> 36:50.209
Well, then, you know, we called it.

36:50.293 --> 36:52.628
- Are you kidding?
- You're confident he's going to win?

36:52.712 --> 36:53.921
- Yes.
- Then why haven't you called it?

36:54.005 --> 36:55.840
It's both too close and too early to call.

36:55.923 --> 36:58.301
- But you're confident Benishek is gonna win?
- Benishek is going to win.

36:58.384 --> 36:59.594
- You're confident?
- He's already won.

36:59.677 --> 37:01.012
- But we can't call it?
- Too close and too early.

37:01.095 --> 37:03.389
I appreciate that science has a very high bar

37:03.472 --> 37:05.057
for what it's willing to call a fact, but...

37:05.141 --> 37:07.727
Benishek is going to win 51-49.

37:10.021 --> 37:11.981
- It's exactly as close as it sounds.
- Okay.

37:13.274 --> 37:14.901
Okay. You can go back. Thanks.

37:16.110 --> 37:18.821

- We will get to that, yes.

(DOOR CLOSES)

37:23.701 --> 37:26.412
- We shouldn't...
- So we called it a little early.

37:26.495 --> 37:28.205
We have Joey take it off the scroll
and make sure

37:28.289 --> 37:30.499
that nobody mentions it again
until the desk gives the green light.

- Benishek.

37:31.959 --> 37:33.586
His campaign manager. The Internet.

37:33.669 --> 37:35.880
- I can steer this.
- Just have Mac have Will retract the call.

37:35.963 --> 37:39.133

you have to take and pass

37:39.216 --> 37:42.261

And the fact that <i>The New York Times</i>
editorial board endorsed

38:02.782 --> 38:06.702
the President and not Governor Romney
isn't of itself a sign of bias.

38:06.827 --> 38:09.288

"I like to fire people,"

not only did you know
exactly what he meant, but you agreed.

38:12.750 --> 38:14.919

"You didn't build that,"

38:15.002 --> 38:17.755
not only did you know exactly what he meant,
you knew that's not what he said.

There's no way.

we were scapegoating you just like Jerry.

- I did.

39:15.312 --> 39:16.731
- Thank you.
- And they changed it back.

39:16.814 --> 39:18.024
What do you mean they changed it back?

39:18.107 --> 39:20.192
The original creator, the page administrator,

39:21.861 --> 39:23.738

- Why? Why did they do that?

39:23.821 --> 39:26.782
Well, I e-mailed him and explained
who I was, that you were my boss

39:26.866 --> 39:29.869
and that you have an expert understanding
of where you did and didn't go to school,

39:29.952 --> 39:31.829
- and I got a very quick reply.
- Saying?

39:31.912 --> 39:33.956
It's Wikipedia's policy not to use information

39:34.040 --> 39:36.542

- Yes. Except you.

- So they won't allow firsthand information?
- No.

39:43.716 --> 39:46.343

- I don't think you do.

Mitt Romney is maintaining his lead 55-43.
