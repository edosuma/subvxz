According to
the Career Aptitude Test,

I'm just gonna be
a blackjack dealer.

18:18.667 --> 18:20.166
Listen, when I took that test,

18:20.233 --> 18:21.667
the result said I was, uh,

18:21.734 --> 18:23.066
most suited for a career

18:23.133 --> 18:25.100
in animal husbandry

I need to think about this.

19:26.033 --> 19:29.133
Oh, and by the way, we were wrong
about the Career Aptitude Test,

19:29.533 --> 19:31.100
it's not a job placement thing.

We're just supposed to be trying
a lot of different stuff on.

will never let you get,

19:44.133 --> 19:46.333

just to see how it looks?

out of your system.

No. So, at the table,

you can call me Matt.

I give Mom and Dad props
for that one.

his name without humiliating him,
