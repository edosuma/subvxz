Well, on the positive side,

to Aiden about the affair.

11:26.163 --> 11:27.730

the mainland.

11:27.774 --> 11:29.210

11:29.253 --> 11:30.777
Y-You know Uncle Jimmy,
the guy with...

11:30.820 --> 11:32.909
Hey, isn't it bad luck
for the bride to see the groom

11:32.953 --> 11:36.043
on their wedding day or...?It's, uh, it's okay.

11:36.870 --> 11:39.611
Serena, these are P.I.s

11:39.655 --> 11:41.265
that I hired.

11:41.309 --> 11:43.485
And I'm really sorry,
but I think I'm owed

11:43.528 --> 11:45.400
an apology, too?

11:46.444 --> 11:47.881
Please, Aiden,
I can explain.

11:47.924 --> 11:49.012
What is this?

11:49.056 --> 11:50.144
Who's he?

11:50.187 --> 11:51.580
He doesn't matter.

11:51.623 --> 11:53.408
Really?

11:53.451 --> 11:55.497

11:55.540 --> 11:57.542

quite sure I know.

12:00.023 --> 12:01.938

12:01.982 --> 12:04.158
wasKate Mulligan.

12:04.201 --> 12:06.813
And the man in the photo is
my ex-husband.

12:07.857 --> 12:10.860
So you've just been lying
to me the whole time?

12:10.904 --> 12:13.515
No. No, Aiden.

12:13.558 --> 12:16.170
Nothing about our life together
is a lie.

12:16.213 --> 12:18.694
I love you and you know me.

12:19.477 --> 12:21.044
I just didn't want
you to know him.

12:21.088 --> 12:23.307
Why not?

12:24.221 --> 12:26.310
Because he's awful.

12:26.354 --> 12:29.226
He's abusive,
controlling.

12:29.270 --> 12:31.228
I was young and dumb
when we met,

12:31.272 --> 12:34.492
and I was lucky to escape
our marriage with my life.

12:35.580 --> 12:36.799
But you got out.

12:36.843 --> 12:39.323
Two years ago,
I'd had enough.

12:40.760 --> 12:43.501
He was passed out, drunk.

12:43.545 --> 12:46.113
I emptied half our bank account
and ran.

12:46.156 --> 12:49.072
Bought a new name,
flew to Hawaii,

12:49.116 --> 12:52.162

tracked you down.

12:52.206 --> 12:53.729
Two weeks ago.

12:53.773 --> 12:56.514
I got a call from
a blocked number-- it was him.

12:57.602 --> 12:59.691
He said he'd moved on
with his life,

12:59.735 --> 13:01.215
but he could still ruin mine.

13:01.258 --> 13:03.826
If I didn't return
what I took,

13:03.870 --> 13:04.958
he was gonna tell you
everything.

13:05.001 --> 13:07.569
So why did you not come
to me with this?

13:07.612 --> 13:10.006
I'm sorry.

13:10.050 --> 13:12.966
He's my past, Aiden.
But you're my future.

13:13.009 --> 13:15.969
Please believe me.

13:21.017 --> 13:22.976
I do.

13:27.676 --> 13:29.721
She's still lying.I know.

13:30.461 --> 13:33.638
And a woman on the run doesn't
luck into a cover that good.

13:33.682 --> 13:35.249
What's she hiding?

13:35.292 --> 13:38.165
I don't know, but Aiden
paid us to find out.

13:38.208 --> 13:40.123
So, in my mind,

13:40.167 --> 13:42.647
it's not over until
they say, "I do."

13:42.691 --> 13:44.693
Yeah, doesn't give us much time.

13:44.736 --> 13:46.869
No, it doesn't-- I think we
got to divide and conquer.

swing an invite

13:48.262 --> 13:49.524

13:49.567 --> 13:51.831

13:53.397 --> 13:55.747
to some extra security
at the wedding.Good.

you're worried.

14:16.768 --> 14:17.813
But he's a resourceful kid.

14:17.857 --> 14:18.988
He can take care of himself.

14:19.032 --> 14:20.772
And, look, he knows
where to find us.

I understand you have a past

But if your ex is
as dangerous as you say he is,

17:42.365 --> 17:45.499

that he's just gonna walk away?

that your ex is still in town.
