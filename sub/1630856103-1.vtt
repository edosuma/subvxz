- So, how do I get back?

11:29.356 --> 11:30.257
Run.

"Run."

so I don't have all his notes,

13:13.493 --> 13:17.530
a cure, using Patient
Z's hemoglobin.

My fault.

13:31.044 --> 13:33.013
What I meant to say was that

13:33.013 --> 13:38.085
I believe he found a way
to use Patient Z's blood

21:30.790 --> 21:34.894
Well, let's not say
friends. We are not friends.

21:34.894 --> 21:37.597
Let's not pretend
we are friends.

21:37.597 --> 21:42.201
I respect you far too much
to insult you like that.

21:50.843 --> 21:52.379
Hm?

21:52.379 --> 21:55.147
You're not here to make
us some scratch, are you?

21:55.147 --> 21:58.184
I must admit, things
are very good.

21:58.184 --> 22:00.119
Very, very good.

22:00.119 --> 22:04.023
Very, very, very good right
now, as I'm sure you've seen.

We used to be friends.

know I love money.

22:21.941 --> 22:23.743
Can't seem to get enough money.

22:24.611 --> 22:26.078
So, what do you say?

22:26.078 --> 22:27.279
Let's make some money.

22:29.248 --> 22:30.583
I need to find someone.

22:31.684 --> 22:33.886
And I know you know everyone.

22:33.886 --> 22:38.491
A scientist who goes by
the name of Dr. Lars.

22:38.491 --> 22:39.392
Oh?

22:40.226 --> 22:41.461
A doctor?

22:42.695 --> 22:45.264
You're not infected,
are you, Jonray?

22:45.264 --> 22:47.400
Please, say it isn't so.

22:47.400 --> 22:49.035
Not my precious Jonray.

22:49.035 --> 22:52.439
Not my warrior, my
champ, my champion.

22:52.439 --> 22:53.740
No one can touch you.

22:55.041 --> 22:56.208
But you

22:56.208 --> 22:58.611
know I can help.

22:58.611 --> 22:59.712
I can.

22:59.712 --> 23:01.347
I know everything.

23:01.347 --> 23:02.782
I know everyone.

23:02.782 --> 23:06.018
I know your doctor,
and I can help.

23:06.018 --> 23:08.320
But it will cost you.

23:08.320 --> 23:10.022
Cost you

23:10.022 --> 23:10.923
money.

23:12.191 --> 23:14.894
Just a little, tiny payment.

23:15.928 --> 23:17.497
Just a little, little,
little payment.

23:17.497 --> 23:19.899
I will make you a good deal.

23:19.899 --> 23:22.569
Bossman always gives
the best deals.

23:22.569 --> 23:27.640

I'll help my precious Jonray!

chance against zombies!

was. A little too lucky.

this lucky, weak little man

can do that twice.

25:05.972 --> 25:08.675

I never said I'd tell you
where this person was.

But wait, Jonray. I told you
I would help you and I will.

29:11.583 --> 29:14.921
It's just, this person
you seek, this doctor?

29:14.921 --> 29:17.156
She's a very important
client of mine.

29:17.156 --> 29:18.590
Very important.

29:18.590 --> 29:22.094
And she's paid me very well.

29:22.094 --> 29:25.464
Very, very well, to stay hidden.

29:25.464 --> 29:28.700

be a man of honor.

29:28.700 --> 29:31.703
I must honor my
business deal with her,

29:31.703 --> 29:35.842
but I must also honor
our business deal.

will find this fair, Jonray.

to seek you out.

I will tell her, if she
honors me, if she respects me,

29:52.724 --> 29:56.795
then she will speak with my
good friend, Jonray, my warrior.

29:57.629 --> 29:59.298
She will do this.

help her decide.

33:02.081 --> 33:04.750
- It is always a
joy to see you, Vin.

33:04.750 --> 33:07.953
- Ah, the pleasure is all
mine, of course, uncle.

33:07.953 --> 33:10.022
Retirement will
never get in my way.

33:10.022 --> 33:12.958
When you need me,
I will always come.

33:12.958 --> 33:15.994
- I know that, and
I appreciate it.

33:15.994 --> 33:18.730
- [Vin] And of course,
I know if you called me,

33:18.730 --> 33:20.732
it must be important.

33:20.732 --> 33:21.900
Top priority.

33:25.071 --> 33:26.905
We need something lost

33:27.839 --> 33:28.707
found.

33:30.209 --> 33:31.210
A zombie.

33:36.515 --> 33:37.949
Patient Z.

33:42.421 --> 33:43.322
Patient

33:44.123 --> 33:45.023
Z?

33:46.158 --> 33:48.927
- With any outbreak,
there is a patient zero.

33:49.861 --> 33:51.097
The start of it all.

33:52.398 --> 33:55.234
But with wifi, it
was the radiation,

33:55.234 --> 33:58.270
soaking the earth for
decades, until it mutated.

34:00.005 --> 34:02.774
It created a virus that
infected the population.

34:04.576 --> 34:06.345
Turned them into monsters.

34:09.448 --> 34:11.417
But we have corrected the wifi.

34:12.218 --> 34:13.985
We fixed that situation.

34:15.121 --> 34:19.958
In, let's say, the
important communities.

34:21.693 --> 34:23.929
But the millions upon
millions from the outbreak,

34:23.929 --> 34:25.297
they roam free,

34:26.698 --> 34:29.701
infecting others with their
organic form of the disease.

34:31.603 --> 34:33.004
But there's the treatment.

34:34.306 --> 34:36.142
It holds back the radiation,

34:37.143 --> 34:39.545
and it keeps the
living doing just that.

34:40.746 --> 34:41.647
Living.

34:44.183 --> 34:47.119
- Well, I can attest
to its effectiveness.

34:49.488 --> 34:53.125
- [sighs] Every time I
see that, it crushes me.

34:54.460 --> 34:57.263
It breaks my heart to know
that someone I love like a son

34:57.263 --> 34:59.431
is infected with this
terrible disease.

35:01.467 --> 35:04.603
But now you know why Patient
Z is so important to me.

35:06.238 --> 35:09.441
Where do you think the
treatment that keeps you,

35:09.441 --> 35:12.511
my friends, my colleagues,
all of you, alive?

35:12.511 --> 35:14.246
Where do you think
it comes from?

35:20.118 --> 35:22.053
It comes from a zombie?

35:22.053 --> 35:24.223
[ominous tones]

35:24.223 --> 35:25.090
Yes.

35:32.231 --> 35:36.268
We came across him while we
were searching for the cure.

35:36.268 --> 35:38.570
There was something
special about his blood.

35:39.905 --> 35:42.374
It continued to regenerate,
unlike any other zombie,

35:43.542 --> 35:45.877
and it held back the radiation.

35:47.979 --> 35:49.748
We have a supply, of course,

35:50.649 --> 35:51.850
but it will run out.

35:53.652 --> 35:55.120
And soon, I am afraid.

35:57.889 --> 36:00.926
And then all of this,
the billions of dollars

36:00.926 --> 36:03.229
my clients have
poured into Nordak,

36:04.330 --> 36:05.931
all of this will go away.

36:09.601 --> 36:11.069
Your bodyguard there.

36:14.940 --> 36:16.107
He will go away.

36:19.611 --> 36:20.846
But worst of all,

36:22.113 --> 36:23.582
you, Vincent.

36:24.650 --> 36:25.951
You will go away.

36:27.686 --> 36:29.655
I need you on this, nephew.

36:31.089 --> 36:34.192
No other person has served
me as well as you have.

36:35.461 --> 36:39.030
I need you to find the
Patient Z and bring him back.

36:41.867 --> 36:44.135
Well, I can assure you, uncle,

36:44.135 --> 36:49.207
even if I didn't have a
personal interest in the matter,

36:51.076 --> 36:54.212
I can assure you that it would
have my complete attention.

36:55.514 --> 36:58.216
I will find him and I
will bring him back.

36:59.551 --> 37:00.552
Intact.

37:05.391 --> 37:06.625
I know that you will.

37:07.493 --> 37:09.094
You have always made me proud.

37:10.462 --> 37:11.930
And I've always done my best
to take very good care of you

37:11.930 --> 37:15.166
for your years of
love and loyalty.

37:15.166 --> 37:17.969
- For you, uncle, I
would do it for free.

37:19.104 --> 37:20.372
I know that you would.

37:23.709 --> 37:28.146
- [Vin] So, is there anything
else I should be aware of?

37:28.146 --> 37:30.982
No. That is all for now.

37:30.982 --> 37:34.085
Just find Patient Z and
bring him back to me.

37:35.020 --> 37:37.188
Unharmed, if possible.

37:37.188 --> 37:39.725
Or at the very least,
still reanimated.

37:41.226 --> 37:44.029
And if anyone or anything
gets in your way,

37:45.130 --> 37:46.965

Though those tapered
off, years ago.

41:58.516 --> 42:00.451
I guess the local
politicians decided

42:00.451 --> 42:02.087
there were more pressing matters

42:02.087 --> 42:05.056
than what sort of contraband
the settlements were running.

42:07.292 --> 42:09.527
Or perhaps they just
lacked the manpower.

But eventually, I
had a better idea.

42:29.681 --> 42:33.484
Now I keep them a bit,
so I can study them,

42:34.552 --> 42:36.688

what triggers them,

42:38.056 --> 42:40.626
how good their senses are
when they lock on prey.

A little blood, a little
guts, a little bones.

48:14.859 --> 48:18.496
The hardest part is
coming up with a name.

48:18.496 --> 48:22.133
How about "Undeath by Whiskey"?

48:23.134 --> 48:24.035
I don't know.

48:26.004 --> 48:27.105
What do you think?

[suspenseful music]

48:34.545 --> 48:36.214
Jonray!

48:38.183 --> 48:39.117

Who do you think you are?

49:22.927 --> 49:25.030
You think you're human?

49:25.030 --> 49:25.930
Well, you're not.

49:26.931 --> 49:28.366
That'll never happen again.

You know...

50:02.133 --> 50:03.768
I'm sorry for what I said.

50:05.803 --> 50:08.806
It's just that what you did...

50:13.744 --> 50:15.580
It's not possible.

50:16.914 --> 50:18.783
It's just not possible.

50:20.718 --> 50:21.619
But yet...

50:22.820 --> 50:24.522
Here we are.

50:28.426 --> 50:30.095

Ah.

54:20.257 --> 54:21.626
Just in time.

54:23.894 --> 54:26.130
So you saw the van
that we're looking for?

54:27.197 --> 54:28.433
What about the driver?

54:30.568 --> 54:31.902
[Vin scoffs]

54:31.902 --> 54:34.104
Well, if you were
to see him again,

54:34.104 --> 54:35.873
would you be able
to identify him?

54:37.508 --> 54:38.409
Good.

54:39.410 --> 54:40.711
You see this?

54:42.647 --> 54:43.748
It's a cell phone.

54:44.882 --> 54:48.085
Direct line to me, and me only.

54:48.085 --> 54:49.654
You see that man again,

54:50.888 --> 54:51.822
you call me.

54:52.923 --> 54:55.526
You do that and all
this can be yours.

54:56.494 --> 54:57.628
So, what do you say?

54:59.730 --> 55:00.598
We got a deal?

55:02.600 --> 55:03.501
Good.

55:04.602 --> 55:05.670
Now get outta here.

55:10.741 --> 55:12.309
- [Bodyguard] One
would have been good.

55:12.309 --> 55:15.145
- You and I both know the
radiation from that cell phone

55:15.145 --> 55:16.614
will turn him within a week.

55:17.715 --> 55:20.150
I need results, fast.

55:21.151 --> 55:22.387
And I don't fail.

55:23.320 --> 55:25.189
[bodyguard chuckles]

55:25.189 --> 55:27.692
- Still lamenting over
the one who got away.

55:28.759 --> 55:30.628
For all signs point
to her embrace,

55:30.628 --> 55:32.663
within the dark arms of death.

55:33.798 --> 55:35.500
Well, until I find a body,

58:04.414 --> 58:06.116
What's up brother?

58:06.116 --> 58:08.185
I'm heading into town.

58:08.185 --> 58:09.687
Starting a new brew.

58:10.755 --> 58:12.823
Running low on supplies.

58:12.823 --> 58:14.058
You need anything?

58:14.058 --> 58:16.226
No, No all good.. I'm good.

[Crisanto screams]

58:19.964 --> 58:21.498

58:21.498 --> 58:24.401
Z! You gotta stop doing that!

58:29.874 --> 58:30.775
Jonray!

58:32.677 --> 58:34.812
Why does he have those clothes?

58:34.812 --> 58:36.280
What's wrong with the clothes?

58:36.280 --> 58:38.983
I thought Johnny can
use some new clothes.

58:38.983 --> 58:40.517
"Johnny"?

58:40.517 --> 58:42.519
You're kidding me, right?

58:42.519 --> 58:44.755
You're giving him
the name "Johnny"?

58:44.755 --> 58:46.156
Crisanto please.

58:46.156 --> 58:47.057
Let it go.

58:48.993 --> 58:50.360
"Let it go."

58:51.562 --> 58:53.764
He's not a lost puppy
that you just found

58:53.764 --> 58:55.866
and you're gonna keep forever!

58:55.866 --> 58:57.267
He's a zombie!

58:57.267 --> 59:00.605
An unusual one, yes,
but he's still a zombie!

59:00.605 --> 59:02.840
People are gonna
come looking for him!

59:02.840 --> 59:07.177
Hopefully, that doctor, but
if not, then other people!

59:07.177 --> 59:09.113
Powerful people!

59:09.113 --> 59:11.315
And don't say, So what
are you going to do?

59:11.315 --> 59:13.818
- What. You don't
think I realize that?

59:13.818 --> 59:15.219
No! I don't belive you do.

59:15.219 --> 59:16.887
Don't believe it then.

59:22.192 --> 59:23.560
Later.

You did good today, Johnny.

01:01:16.440 --> 01:01:20.244
Maybe one day, we'll
move you up to the house.

01:01:23.313 --> 01:01:24.481
Do me a favor, though.

01:01:25.615 --> 01:01:26.516
For now,

01:03:02.046 --> 01:03:04.448

They said he was
just another zombie

01:06:26.883 --> 01:06:30.487
brought in for testing,
but I had my doubts.

His cells regenerated.

No zombie ever did that.

01:06:37.494 --> 01:06:39.529
They knew his blood was a
resistance to the virus,

01:06:39.529 --> 01:06:41.731
before we had even
conducted one test.

01:06:43.900 --> 01:06:45.835

Why don't I show you my room?

01:07:31.515 --> 01:07:34.318
We can let these two adults
have some quiet time,

01:07:34.318 --> 01:07:37.487
and discuss business.

01:07:37.487 --> 01:07:40.124
Sorry. You're not my type.

01:07:40.124 --> 01:07:42.559
Not your, what?

01:07:42.559 --> 01:07:44.428
Strong and muscular?

01:07:46.696 --> 01:07:48.232
I'm slouching.

01:07:48.232 --> 01:07:49.099
Look.

01:07:52.136 --> 01:07:53.069
This is it.

01:07:54.571 --> 01:07:56.306
I mean, some of it's missing.

01:07:57.641 --> 01:08:00.810
The initial prep but I can fill
in those blanks easy enough.

01:08:00.810 --> 01:08:02.612
Can you imagine it?

01:08:02.612 --> 01:08:04.681
A permanent cure?

01:08:04.681 --> 01:08:06.916
No more payouts on
weekly treatments?

01:08:08.218 --> 01:08:10.354
One shot at birth and
you're immune to the bites.

01:08:11.121 --> 01:08:12.622
Immune to the radiation.

01:08:13.657 --> 01:08:15.859
This will cripple
Nordak, in the long run.

01:08:17.461 --> 01:08:19.796
Look, we have to get
Johnny outta here.

01:08:19.796 --> 01:08:21.998
I have a lab, well hidden.

01:08:21.998 --> 01:08:23.300
We have to get him there.

01:08:24.501 --> 01:08:27.337
- Wait. A permanent
cure for what?

01:08:27.337 --> 01:08:28.705
I'll explain later.

01:08:30.006 --> 01:08:31.708
You are taking him?

01:08:31.708 --> 01:08:34.878
- Well, yes, of course.
We can't keep him here.

01:08:38.315 --> 01:08:41.618
I'm amazed you've been able
to keep him hidden this long.

01:08:41.618 --> 01:08:44.254
- I've seen heavy
patrols in town,

01:08:45.489 --> 01:08:48.225
but the outskirts are vast.

01:08:48.225 --> 01:08:50.627
They don't come
around here anymore.

01:08:50.627 --> 01:08:54.664
- But they will, eventually,
when Patient Z doesn't turn up.

01:08:54.664 --> 01:08:57.967
Regardless, we need my lab
and I think the two of you

01:08:57.967 --> 01:08:59.803
would wanna get
back to your lives.

01:09:02.806 --> 01:09:04.308
I'll go with you.

01:09:04.308 --> 01:09:06.075
- Look, if you're worried
about me, I have Emge here,

01:09:06.075 --> 01:09:08.245
and a larger escort set
up near the south gate.

01:09:08.245 --> 01:09:11.581
- I'm going, at least
till you get back.

01:09:11.581 --> 01:09:14.684
After that, if I'm comfortable,
I'll head back here.

01:09:19.256 --> 01:09:21.057
- It's not me you're
worried about.

01:09:22.259 --> 01:09:23.527
How you call him Johnny.

01:09:26.095 --> 01:09:27.130
You care about him.

01:09:28.131 --> 01:09:29.999
- Are you guys
expecting anyone else?

01:09:29.999 --> 01:09:32.269

01:12:36.420 --> 01:12:38.087
I'll check the woods.

01:12:38.087 --> 01:12:40.724
If he's not there, I'll
double check the house.

01:12:40.724 --> 01:12:43.727
Dr. Lars, you
cover the aqueduct.

01:12:43.727 --> 01:12:48.131
Crisanto, try the yard to
the right and if not there

01:12:48.131 --> 01:12:49.733
then come back here

01:12:49.733 --> 01:12:51.635
We leave then.

01:12:51.635 --> 01:12:53.002
We can't.

01:12:53.002 --> 01:12:54.237
We're not leaving Johnny.

And I do not know how
you found this property

in the first place.

01:14:16.953 --> 01:14:20.790

with the disease.

01:19:40.109 --> 01:19:40.977

could never let you escape.

01:19:54.490 --> 01:19:57.293
[dramatic music]

01:20:03.666 --> 01:20:04.567
Z!

01:20:05.935 --> 01:20:08.204
[glass shatters]
[flames roar]

01:20:08.204 --> 01:20:11.407
[guns fire rapidly]

01:20:11.407 --> 01:20:12.308
Z!

01:20:14.143 --> 01:20:15.678
[guns fire rapidly]

01:20:15.678 --> 01:20:18.481
[soldier groans]

01:20:28.024 --> 01:20:30.226
[gun fires rapidly]

01:20:30.226 --> 01:20:31.194
Z!

01:20:31.194 --> 01:20:32.461
Come on!

01:20:32.461 --> 01:20:34.363
[guns fire rapidly]

01:20:34.363 --> 01:20:36.632
You can run, Patient Z!

01:20:36.632 --> 01:20:38.501
But you will want
to come find me.

01:20:39.668 --> 01:20:42.371
And you already know
exactly how to do that.

01:20:42.371 --> 01:20:44.507
[dramatic music continues]

01:20:44.507 --> 01:20:45.308
Johnny!

01:20:52.215 --> 01:20:54.683
[engine revs]

01:20:55.584 --> 01:20:58.554

[somber music continues]

01:22:21.204 --> 01:22:24.707
[motorcycle engine revs]

01:22:31.214 --> 01:22:33.616
This used to be
Jonray's favorite place.

01:22:36.052 --> 01:22:37.620
He'd come up here with Johnny.

01:22:40.756 --> 01:22:42.458
I'm not sure if
he told you that.

01:22:45.194 --> 01:22:46.462
That was his son's name.

01:22:48.197 --> 01:22:49.098
My nephew.

01:22:51.600 --> 01:22:52.401
Johnny.

01:22:59.042 --> 01:23:01.010
Johnny loved
watching the bikers.

01:23:02.245 --> 01:23:04.713
They'd sit up here
together, for hours.

01:23:06.249 --> 01:23:07.150
Right here.

01:23:09.818 --> 01:23:13.722
When he was old enough,
he got his own bike.

01:23:15.224 --> 01:23:16.492
He was a smart kid.

01:23:17.960 --> 01:23:19.728
Smartest kid I ever knew.

01:23:21.030 --> 01:23:22.731
Not really coordinated, though.

01:23:24.933 --> 01:23:26.269
He was never great at it.

01:23:27.703 --> 01:23:28.804
But he kept trying.

01:23:29.805 --> 01:23:30.706
Slowly.

01:23:32.308 --> 01:23:33.309
He was improving.

01:23:35.211 --> 01:23:36.279
Jonray, though?

01:23:38.714 --> 01:23:40.015
He was a great dad.

01:23:42.751 --> 01:23:45.421
He'd sit up here and watch
him all day, if he could.

01:23:46.255 --> 01:23:47.456
And when he was done,

01:23:50.059 --> 01:23:52.661
Johnny would come up to
him and ask him how he did.

01:23:54.597 --> 01:23:55.864
Jonray would praise him.

01:23:57.366 --> 01:23:58.267
Every time.

01:24:02.238 --> 01:24:05.108
[Crisanto breathes heavily]

01:24:05.108 --> 01:24:06.008
Ask him...

01:24:08.010 --> 01:24:09.812
He'd tell him how
wonderful he did.

01:24:12.115 --> 01:24:13.416
How proud he was.

01:24:15.050 --> 01:24:16.352
After Johnny died,

01:24:18.354 --> 01:24:21.657
Jonray only came up
here just one more time.

01:24:23.626 --> 01:24:24.493
Then...

01:24:26.129 --> 01:24:28.164
I don't think he
could take it anymore.

01:24:30.433 --> 01:24:32.034
He used to be such a happy guy.

01:24:35.271 --> 01:24:37.506
But the bitterness took over.

01:24:39.007 --> 01:24:40.409
He picked up his sword.

01:24:42.178 --> 01:24:43.812
He'd go into the dead zone.

01:24:48.016 --> 01:24:49.552
He never put it down again.

01:24:51.420 --> 01:24:56.392
But I don't think I need to
tell you about any of that.

01:25:07.170 --> 01:25:10.005
[Crisanto sighs]

01:25:13.142 --> 01:25:16.645
[motorcycle engines rev]

01:25:23.452 --> 01:25:24.920

find me, because Z,
