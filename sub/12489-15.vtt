WEBVTT

00:05.436 --> 00:07.478
HEY, AVERY, IS THAT
ONE OF YOUR FRIENDS?

00:07.478 --> 00:10.511
REALLY? YOU THINK
THIS IS ONE OF MY FRIENDS?

00:12.713 --> 00:16.047
WELL, I WAS HOPING NOT,
BUT I'M TRYING TO BE
LESS "JUDGEY."

00:16.047 --> 00:18.549
IT'S UNION GENERAL
AMBROSE BURNSIDE.

00:18.549 --> 00:20.291
I'M DOING A REPORT
ON THE CIVIL WAR,

00:20.291 --> 00:23.554
BUT I JUST CAN'T FOCUS.
I KEEP THINKING ABOUT...

00:23.554 --> 00:26.097
DUSTIN?
HOW'D YOU KNOW?

00:26.097 --> 00:27.328
JUST A LUCKY GUESS.

00:30.431 --> 00:32.303
I SIT NEXT
TO HIM IN ENGLISH.

00:32.303 --> 00:34.635
HE'S ASKED TO BORROW
MY PENCIL FOUR TIMES.

00:34.635 --> 00:36.367
THAT MEANS SOMETHING,
RIGHT?

00:36.367 --> 00:39.540
YEAH. HE HAS NO REGARD
FOR PENCILS.

00:39.540 --> 00:42.143
YOU'RE NOT HELPING, STAN.

00:42.143 --> 00:44.375
I CAN'T THINK ABOUT
ANYTHING BUT DUSTIN...

00:44.375 --> 00:46.217
NOT EVEN MY SCHOOLWORK.

00:46.217 --> 00:48.219
IT'S LIKE HE'S LIVING
INSIDE MY HEAD.

00:48.219 --> 00:50.721
OH! I SOMETIMES FEEL
THAT WAY ABOUT EAR MITES...

00:50.721 --> 00:53.424
WHICH TECHNICALLY ARE
LIVING INSIDE MY HEAD.

00:55.086 --> 00:57.057
I'VE NEVER FELT
THIS WAY BEFORE.

00:57.057 --> 00:59.090
IT'S LIKE SOMETHING
THERE'S SOMETHING MAKING ME

00:59.090 --> 01:00.731
FEEL WARM AND TINGLY INSIDE,

01:00.731 --> 01:02.263
AND ITS NAME IS...

01:02.263 --> 01:04.235
BACON!
DUSTIN.

01:04.235 --> 01:05.536
( laughing )

01:05.536 --> 01:09.270
OH, I TOTALLY MISJUDGED
WHERE YOU WERE GOING
WITH THAT.

01:09.270 --> 01:11.142
COME ON, STAN.

01:11.142 --> 01:13.144
YOU KNOW, I FEEL
WEIRD SAYING THIS,

01:13.144 --> 01:15.276
BUT I REALLY WANT DUSTIN
TO BE MY BOYFRIEND.

01:15.276 --> 01:16.747
HOW DO I DO THAT?

01:16.747 --> 01:19.380
YOU WAIT FOR BREAKFAST
AND HOPE SOME FALLS
ON THE FLOOR.

01:19.380 --> 01:21.282
THAT'S WHAT I DO WITH BACON.

01:21.282 --> 01:23.284
I'M SERIOUS.

01:23.284 --> 01:24.785
STAN, YOU'RE THE ONE
I COUNT ON.

01:24.785 --> 01:26.517
YOU ALWAYS HAVE
THE BEST ADVICE.

01:26.517 --> 01:28.519
UH, I'D LOVE TO HELP YOU,

01:28.519 --> 01:31.792
BUT I'VE GOT TO GO PLAY
A GAME WITH CHLOE.

01:31.792 --> 01:35.126
STAN, WAIT, I JUST WANNA--

01:35.126 --> 01:38.098
HEY, SWEETIE, I THOUGHT
YOU MIGHT LIKE A SNACK
WHILE YOU STUDY.

01:38.098 --> 01:41.802
WOW! UH...
THAT'S INTERESTING.

01:41.802 --> 01:44.205
IS THERE ANYTHING
YOU'D LIKE TO TALK ABOUT?

01:44.205 --> 01:45.236
NO.
REALLY?

01:45.236 --> 01:46.477
NO.
REALLY?

01:46.477 --> 01:47.608
NO.
REALLY?

01:47.608 --> 01:49.180
YES.
REALLY?

01:49.180 --> 01:51.482
NO.

01:51.482 --> 01:54.445
THIS IS BENNETT JAMES
IN TRAFFIC COPTER 6.

01:54.445 --> 01:57.148
OH, WE'VE GOT A LITTLE
BACKUP ON INTERSTATE 5,

01:57.148 --> 01:59.320
HEADIN' INTO--
HEY, GUESS WHAT!

01:59.320 --> 02:02.253
THOUGHT THOSE TOYS
WERE FOR YOUR PATIENTS.

02:02.253 --> 02:04.595
I WAS JUST MAKIN' SURE
THEY'RE SAFE.

02:06.197 --> 02:08.529
THIS ONE IS NOT.

02:12.863 --> 02:14.705
YOU WERE, UH, SAYING?

02:14.705 --> 02:16.707
YEAH, YEAH.
HUGE NEWS.

02:16.707 --> 02:18.369
AVERY'S GOT
HER FIRST CRUSH.

02:18.369 --> 02:19.870
SHE WROTE HIS NAME
ALL OVER HER ART WALL,

02:19.870 --> 02:22.243
BUT WHEN I ASKED HER
ABOUT HIM, SHE CLAMMED UP.

02:22.243 --> 02:24.575
IT'S TOUGH TO TALK TO KIDS
ABOUT THIS STUFF.

02:24.575 --> 02:26.547
IT TOOK ME YEARS
TO DEVELOP THE SKILLS

02:26.547 --> 02:29.520
TO CREATE A PROTECTED
ENVIRONMENT WHERE KIDS

02:29.520 --> 02:30.851
CAN FEEL SAFE.

02:34.685 --> 02:39.230
TRUST ME-- I KNOW
HOW TO GET RETICENT
KIDS TO OPEN UP.

02:39.230 --> 02:39.860
NO.
REALLY?

02:39.860 --> 02:41.392
NO.
REALLY?

02:41.392 --> 02:43.734
IF YOUR MOM ASKS, YOU
OPENED UP AND TOLD ME
EVERYTHING.

02:43.734 --> 02:44.935
REALLY?
NO.

02:47.838 --> 02:50.341
SO AVERY HAS
HER FIRST CRUSH.

02:50.341 --> 02:51.872
I JUST GOT OVER A CRAZY
CRUSH ON A FRENCH POODLE

02:51.872 --> 02:53.744
A COUPLE WEEKS AGO.

02:53.744 --> 02:57.248
I WAS SO OBSESSED,
I CONSIDERED GETTING
THE SAME HAIRCUT.

03:19.570 --> 03:23.604
I BELIEVE MY CASTLE HAS
PUT YOUR KING IN DANGER.

03:23.604 --> 03:25.736
YEAH, IN REGULAR
BORING CHESS.

03:25.736 --> 03:27.578
BUT IN CHLOE CHESS,

03:27.578 --> 03:30.311
CASTLES CAN'T MOVE
WITHOUT PERMISSION
FROM THE CITY.

03:30.311 --> 03:32.383
DO YOU HAVE PERMISSION
FROM THE CITY?

03:32.383 --> 03:33.814
NO.

03:33.814 --> 03:36.617
LUCKILY I DO!

03:41.622 --> 03:42.653
YOUR TURN.

03:44.825 --> 03:47.798
HA HA! THERE!
I GOT ONE OF YOUR PAWNS.

03:47.798 --> 03:50.301
THAT SPACE HAS
A BOOBY TRAP ON IT.

03:50.301 --> 03:51.762
( imitates explosions )

03:51.762 --> 03:53.734
HEY!

03:57.938 --> 03:59.670
AVERY.

03:59.670 --> 04:01.372
IS YOUR DUSTIN HERE?

04:01.372 --> 04:03.274
NOT YET, BUT HE ALWAYS
RIDES HIS BIKE HERE

04:03.274 --> 04:04.575
AFTER SCHOOL.

04:04.575 --> 04:05.916
THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR MEETING ME.

04:05.916 --> 04:07.618
I REALLY NEED HELP
FROM SOMEONE

04:07.618 --> 04:08.849
WHO UNDERSTANDS BOYS.

04:08.849 --> 04:10.321
DON'T WORRY.

04:10.321 --> 04:13.324
I WILL HELP MAKE HIM
YOUR "DUSTINY."

04:13.324 --> 04:16.657
( laughing ) I INVENTED
AMERICAN-STYLE JOKE!

04:16.657 --> 04:19.930
IF HIS NAME WAS GEORGE,
THAT WOULD NOT HAVE WORKED.

04:19.930 --> 04:21.762
OOH OOH! THERE HE IS!

04:21.762 --> 04:23.594
THAT'S DUSTIN.

04:23.594 --> 04:25.496
WHICH ONE?
THERE.

04:25.496 --> 04:28.268
DUSTIN PITT.
AVERY THINKS HE'S CUTE,

04:28.268 --> 04:30.501
BUT WOULDN'T HE LOOK
BETTER LIKE THIS?

04:41.652 --> 04:43.554
HEY, NIKKI, WHAT'S UP?

04:43.554 --> 04:47.518
IT'S THE OPPOSITE OF DOWN.

04:47.518 --> 04:50.521
( laughing )
I LOVE THE AMERICAN
JOKE STYLE!

04:50.521 --> 04:51.862
IF YOU HAD SAID
"HOW'S IT GOING?"

04:51.862 --> 04:54.525
THAT WOULD NOT HAVE WORKED.

04:54.525 --> 04:56.827
YOU'RE HILARIOUS,
AND SO GOOD LOOKING.

04:56.827 --> 04:58.769
IT'S LIKE
WE'RE THE SAME PERSON.

04:58.769 --> 05:01.772
SO, UH, WANNA HANG OUT
SOME TIME?

05:01.772 --> 05:03.474
TYLER, NIKKI'S HELPING ME
WITH SOMETHING

05:03.474 --> 05:05.636
THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT
TO ME. NOT NOW.

05:05.636 --> 05:08.038
COOL. WHAT CAN NIKKI
AND I HELP YOU WITH?

05:08.038 --> 05:09.740
LET ME TALK TO NIKKI,
AND THEN YOU CAN MEET HER

05:09.740 --> 05:11.612
AT THE BROGURT SHOP
ON WHITMAN AVENUE.

05:11.612 --> 05:12.983
SHE'S HEADING THERE
IN A MINUTE.

05:12.983 --> 05:15.746
SWEET! SEE YOU.

05:15.746 --> 05:16.987
BUT I AM NOT GETTING
"BROGURT"

05:16.987 --> 05:18.689
ON WHITMAN AVENUE.

05:18.689 --> 05:19.720
AND NEITHER IS HE.

05:19.720 --> 05:22.052
THERE'S NO BROGURT SHOP
ON WHITMAN AVENUE.

05:22.052 --> 05:23.554
THERE'S NO WHITMAN AVENUE...

05:23.554 --> 05:25.856
AND THERE'S NO SUCH THING
AS BROGURT!

05:27.097 --> 05:28.499
HEY, YOU'RE AVERY,
RIGHT?

05:28.499 --> 05:29.800
FROM MR. HAWORTH'S CLASS?

05:31.932 --> 05:33.634
YOU KNOW TYLER JAMES?

05:33.634 --> 05:35.706
( silly giggle )

05:35.706 --> 05:38.709
UH, HE IS HER BROTHER.

05:38.709 --> 05:42.513
NO WAY! TYLER'S
AN AMAZING RIDER.
HE'S, LIKE, MY IDOL.

05:42.513 --> 05:44.715
WHAAA!

05:47.017 --> 05:49.349
UH, AVERY,
WEREN'T YOU AND TYLER

05:49.349 --> 05:51.622
GOING TO HANG OUT
AT YOUR HOUSE TOMORROW?

05:51.622 --> 05:53.123
MAYBE DUSTIN COULD
HANG OUT, TOO.

05:53.123 --> 05:54.885
YEAH, THAT'D BE AWESOME.

05:54.885 --> 05:57.588
( clicks tongue )

05:57.588 --> 06:01.392
GREAT. AVERY WILL
SEE YOU THEN.

06:01.392 --> 06:03.764
YAY!

06:03.764 --> 06:06.497
BUT WAIT-- I WAS
SO NERVOUS AND TONGUE-TIED.

06:06.497 --> 06:08.769
DID I JUST MAKE A COMPLETE
FOOL OUT OF MYSELF?

06:08.769 --> 06:10.841
I THOUGHT SO, BUT HE
DIDN'T SEEM TO NOTICE!

06:17.448 --> 06:19.410
THERE'S NO BROGURT SHOP
ON WHITMAN AVENUE.

06:19.410 --> 06:21.111
THERE IS NO WHITMAN AVENUE.

06:21.111 --> 06:23.754
AND THERE'S NO SUCH THING
AS "BROGURT."

06:23.754 --> 06:25.456
I'M REALLY SORRY.

06:25.456 --> 06:27.387
YOU SHOULD BE.
I JUST RODE 37 MILES

06:27.387 --> 06:30.390
SCREAMING THE WORD "BROGURT"
AT THE TOP OF MY LUNGS.

06:30.390 --> 06:31.992
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'LL MAKE IT UP TO YOU.

06:31.992 --> 06:34.525
I'LL LET YOU HANG OUT
WITH DUSTIN AND ME TOMORROW.

06:34.525 --> 06:37.768
THERE'LL BE BROGURT.
REALLY? STOP THAT!

06:37.768 --> 06:41.472
I'M NOT HANGING OUT
WITH SOME 6th-GRADE DWEEB.

06:41.472 --> 06:43.804
PLEASE, JUST HANG OUT
WITH DUSTIN AND ME

06:43.804 --> 06:45.175
WHEN HE COMES OVER
TOMORROW.

06:45.175 --> 06:46.406
HE REALLY LOOKS UP TO YOU.

06:46.406 --> 06:48.439
GIVE ME ONE HOUR.
I'LL DO ANYTHING.

06:48.439 --> 06:50.641
FINE, BUT YOU'VE GOT
TO MAKE NIKKI LOVE ME.

06:50.641 --> 06:53.784
I'M SMALL.
I'M NOT MAGICAL.

06:53.784 --> 06:57.087
OKAY, JUST FIND OUT
WHAT NIKKI LOOKS
FOR IN GUYS.

06:57.087 --> 06:59.089
AND DON'T TELL ME
TO MEET HER AT SOME
"BONUT" SHOP

06:59.089 --> 07:00.120
ON FAKE STREET.

07:00.120 --> 07:01.992
DID I HEAR SOMEONE
MENTION "BONUTS"?

07:01.992 --> 07:03.494
IF IT'S HALF-BONE,
HALF-DONUT,

07:03.494 --> 07:05.155
I'LL TAKE A DOZEN
LIVER-FILLED.

07:05.155 --> 07:08.428
AND IF IT ISN'T,
IT'S JUST A CRUEL JOKE.

07:10.200 --> 07:11.602
SHE WON'T TALK TO ME.

07:11.602 --> 07:13.433
I'VE BEEN THROUGH
HER DECOY DIARY,

07:13.433 --> 07:15.205
HER REAL DIARY,
HER COMPUTER.

07:15.205 --> 07:17.868
I DON'T KNOW WHY
SHE WON'T TRUST ME.

07:17.868 --> 07:20.871
HONEY, YOU'RE GOING
OVERBOARD ON THIS
DUSTIN THING.

07:20.871 --> 07:22.172
IT'S A SCHOOLGIRL CRUSH.

07:22.172 --> 07:24.875
LET'S JUST GIVE AVERY
SOME SPACE ON THIS.

07:24.875 --> 07:27.077
SHE'S MY LITTLE BABY,
BENNETT.

07:27.077 --> 07:28.749
I DON'T CARE HOW MANY TIMES
SHE CALLED ME

07:28.749 --> 07:30.551
"THAT PRYING SNOOP"
IN HER DIARY.

07:30.551 --> 07:33.053
FORTY-TWO.
IT WAS VERY HURTFUL.

07:33.053 --> 07:35.926
HONEY, I'M SORRY TO BE
THE LECTURER HERE,

07:35.926 --> 07:37.828
BUT IF YOU DON'T WANT
YOUR FEELINGS HURT,

07:37.828 --> 07:39.730
YOU PROBABLY SHOULDN'T BE
POKING AROUND

07:39.730 --> 07:41.492
IN OTHER PEOPLE'S
PRIVATE BUSINESS.

07:41.492 --> 07:43.834
YOU'RE RIGHT.
IT'S LIKE WHEN YOU WERE
IN THE SEVENTH GRADE...

07:43.834 --> 07:45.465
AND YOU SNOOPED
ON THOSE GIRLS

07:45.465 --> 07:47.768
AND YOU HEARD THEM
CALL YOU "CHICKEN LEGS."

07:47.768 --> 07:48.999
YOU READ MY DIARY?

07:48.999 --> 07:51.502
WILD GUESS
TO MAKE A POINT.

07:51.502 --> 07:53.504
HEY, BUT YOU GREW
OUT OF IT, HUH?

07:53.504 --> 07:56.707
LOOK AT THOSE BIG,
MEATY BUFFALO LEGS.

07:58.879 --> 08:01.051
NOT MAKING IT BETTER,
AM I?

08:01.051 --> 08:02.953
EVER BEEN KICKED
BY A BUFFALO?

08:05.255 --> 08:06.587
HA HA HA HA!

08:06.587 --> 08:08.859
ALL RIGHT,
GET OUT OF THIS ONE!

08:13.123 --> 08:14.825
CHLOE RULE TEN--

08:14.825 --> 08:18.829
A GIANT ARM FROM THE SKY
HAS WIPED OUT YOUR PIECES.

08:18.829 --> 08:20.070
I WIN!

08:20.070 --> 08:22.833
THIS IS THE WORST
GAME EVER. I AM DONE!

08:22.833 --> 08:24.174
Avery: STAN,
COME HERE, BOY!

08:24.174 --> 08:25.636
ON SECOND THOUGHT,
SET 'EM UP.

08:25.636 --> 08:27.678
BUT AVERY JUST CALLED YOU.

08:27.678 --> 08:29.640
YOU HAVEN'T BEEN SPENDING
MUCH TIME WITH HER LATELY.

08:29.640 --> 08:31.041
IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

08:31.041 --> 08:34.214
THERE'S SOMETHING GOING ON,
BUT IT'S NOT YOUR PROBLEM.

08:34.214 --> 08:36.747
NOW, ARE WE GONNA PLAY,
OR WHAT?

08:36.747 --> 08:38.619
TOO LATE.
YOU LOSE AGAIN.

08:38.619 --> 08:40.290
WHILE YOU WERE TALKING,
I TIED YOUR KING

08:40.290 --> 08:43.223
TO THE BALLOON OF DOOM!

08:47.197 --> 08:48.829
OH, UH, HEY, MOM.

08:48.829 --> 08:51.231
I WAS WONDERING IF I COULD
HAVE A FRIEND OVER FROM
SCHOOL LATER.

08:51.231 --> 08:52.903
OH! A FRIEND FROM SCHOOL?

08:52.903 --> 08:55.836
IS IT LINDSAY?
NO, SHE'S OUT OF TOWN.

08:55.836 --> 08:58.308
SARAH? HEATHER? SHONDRA?

08:58.308 --> 09:00.671
LAURIE? KIMI? RACHEL?
CARLA? LUPE?

09:00.671 --> 09:02.172
XING XAO RUBINSTEIN?

09:04.014 --> 09:06.016
NO, IT'S ACTUALLY DUSTIN.

09:06.016 --> 09:08.148
REALLY? HOW NICE.

09:08.148 --> 09:11.181
SHE'S CONFIDING IN ME!
SHE'S SHARING!

09:11.181 --> 09:13.053
WHAT DO I SAY?
WHAT DO I SAY?

09:13.053 --> 09:16.156
WHAT WOULD XING XAO
RUBINSTEIN'S MOTHER SAY?

09:16.156 --> 09:19.289
SO... ANYTHING
YOU NEED HELP WITH?

09:19.289 --> 09:22.162
MAYBE I SHOULD TALK TO HER.
MAYBE SHE CAN HELP.

09:22.162 --> 09:26.266
OHH! NOT THE DESPERATE
HELP FACE.

09:26.266 --> 09:30.070
UH... NAH. I DON'T
THINK I NEED ANY HELP.

09:30.070 --> 09:32.202
OH, NO.
SHE'S SHUTTING DOWN.

09:32.202 --> 09:35.005
SHE'S DOING
THE CLAMMING-UP FACE.

09:35.005 --> 09:39.910
SHE HATES ME. I'M
REPEATING MY RELATIONSHIP
WITH MY OWN MOTHER.

09:39.910 --> 09:41.211
WELL...

09:41.211 --> 09:43.914
YOU TWO HAVE FUN.

09:43.914 --> 09:45.816
HOW AM I SUPPOSED
TO HAVE FUN?

09:45.816 --> 09:47.718
WHAT IF HE DOESN'T
LIKE ME?

09:47.718 --> 09:48.989
DID MY KNEES GET BIGGER?

09:48.989 --> 09:52.322
OH, I HAVE REALLY,
REALLY BIG KNEES!

09:52.322 --> 09:55.025
WHY AM I WORRYING?

09:55.025 --> 09:57.768
SHE SEEMS FINE,
LIKE SHE'S DONE THIS BEFORE.

09:57.768 --> 10:00.100
MAYBE SHE'S HAD
OTHER BOYFRIENDS.

10:00.100 --> 10:02.102
DID I MISS A DIARY?

10:05.105 --> 10:06.937
ANYWAY,
IF YOU WANT TO CHAT,

10:06.937 --> 10:08.308
I'M ALWAYS AROUND.

10:08.308 --> 10:10.310
YEAH, YOU SHOULD REALLY
GET OUT MORE.

10:16.947 --> 10:18.188
OH, GOOD. YOU'RE HERE.

10:18.188 --> 10:20.721
I AM SO NERVOUS.
DUSTIN'S COMING OVER,

10:20.721 --> 10:22.392
AND I'M REALLY
HOPING THAT AFTER
WE HANG OUT TODAY,

10:22.392 --> 10:24.224
HE'LL BE MY BOYFRIEND,
BUT I DON'T KNOW WHAT
TO DO.

10:24.224 --> 10:27.157
IS MY HAIR ALL RIGHT?
HOW MUCH EYE CONTACT
IS TOO MUCH?

10:27.157 --> 10:31.401
IS THIS TOO MUCH?
IS THIS TOO MUCH?
HOW 'BOUT THIS?

10:31.401 --> 10:33.103
IS THAT YOUR
BREATH OR MINE?

10:33.103 --> 10:35.005
OH, I REALLY
HOPE IT'S YOURS.

10:35.005 --> 10:37.237
YOU LOOK GREAT.
I GOTTA GO-- CHLOE CHESS.

10:37.237 --> 10:39.639
HAVE A MINT TO BE SAFE.

10:42.172 --> 10:44.144
WAIT, STAN,
I NEED YOUR HELP.

10:44.144 --> 10:45.846
OH, FINALLY, YOU'RE HERE.

10:45.846 --> 10:47.678
DUSTIN'S ON HIS WAY.

10:47.678 --> 10:49.219
OH, RIGHT.
THE 6th-GRADE DWEEB.

10:49.219 --> 10:50.881
DO I REALLY HAVE
TO DO THIS?

10:50.881 --> 10:52.923
IF YOU WANT ME
TO HELP YOU WITH NIKKI.

10:52.923 --> 10:54.985
ONE HOUR. WE HAD A DEAL.

10:54.985 --> 10:56.857
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

10:56.857 --> 10:58.158
( doorbell rings )
THAT'S DUSTIN!

10:58.158 --> 11:00.390
LET HIM IN BEFORE HE LEAVES!

11:05.095 --> 11:06.196
HEY, NIKKI.

11:06.196 --> 11:08.198
TYLER, I WAITED FOR YOU
AT THE BROGURT SHOP.

11:08.198 --> 11:09.840
WHERE WERE YOU?

11:09.840 --> 11:11.371
I KNOW YOU'RE TEASING ME.

11:11.371 --> 11:13.173
ARE YOU SURE?

11:13.173 --> 11:15.145
NO.

11:15.145 --> 11:17.047
I CAME TO SEE
IF YOU NEED HELP

11:17.047 --> 11:18.749
BECAUSE YOUR DUSTIN
IS COMING OVER.

11:18.749 --> 11:20.911
THANK GOODNESS.
I AM SO NERVOUS.

11:20.911 --> 11:22.212
NIKKI,
WHAT'S YOUR SECRET?

11:22.212 --> 11:25.155
MY BROTHER DIDN'T FALL,
HE WAS PUSHED.

11:25.155 --> 11:28.288
I MEANT
FOR ATTRACTING BOYS.

11:28.288 --> 11:31.792
OH. ( titters )
FORGET THAT OTHER THING.

11:31.792 --> 11:34.324
( doorbell rings )
( gasps )

11:34.324 --> 11:35.365
WE'LL GET THE DOOR,

11:35.365 --> 11:37.067
YOU KEEP HIM WAITING
FOR A FEW SECONDS,

11:37.067 --> 11:38.368
AND THEN MAKE
A BIG ENTRANCE.

11:38.368 --> 11:41.471
GOOD IDEA.
OH, I'M SO NERVOUS!

11:46.136 --> 11:47.938
YOU'RE TYLER JAMES!

11:47.938 --> 11:50.210
MY FRIENDS AND ME,
WE WATCH YOU RIDE
ALL THE TIME.

11:50.210 --> 11:51.411
YOU ARE AWESOME!

11:51.411 --> 11:54.314
THANKS. I HAVE
NO IDEA WHO YOU ARE.

11:54.314 --> 11:57.117
That is so cool!

11:57.117 --> 11:58.949
AVERY, COME ON.

11:58.949 --> 12:00.720
I THINK YOU SHOULD
HANG OUT WITH HER.

12:00.720 --> 12:02.222
Okay.

12:02.222 --> 12:04.224
OH! IS THAT YOU,
DUSTIN?

12:04.224 --> 12:06.226
HI.

12:09.159 --> 12:11.862
WELL! THAT WAS WEIRD.

12:20.340 --> 12:22.873
THERE SHE IS!

12:22.873 --> 12:24.044
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

12:24.044 --> 12:25.275
OH, YEAH.

12:25.275 --> 12:28.018
I ALWAYS COME DOWN
THE STAIRS LIKE THAT.

12:28.018 --> 12:29.149
IT WAS HILARIOUS.

12:29.149 --> 12:32.152
AND YOU DIDN'T,
LIKE, YOU KNOW,
CRY OR ANYTHING.

12:32.152 --> 12:34.184
NO. WANT TO REAL BAD,

12:34.184 --> 12:35.886
BUT, UH, NO.

12:35.886 --> 12:37.227
DUSTIN,
SIT ON THE COUCH.

12:37.227 --> 12:40.160
WHATEVER YOU SAY, TYLER.

12:40.160 --> 12:42.332
WELL, I'D BETTER GO.

12:42.332 --> 12:44.194
I'LL BE BACK LATER
TO FIND OUT HOW IT WENT.

12:44.194 --> 12:46.867
OW! OW! OW!

12:48.168 --> 12:50.140
BYE, TYLER.

12:50.140 --> 12:52.242
UH, I HOPE IT'S OKAY
THAT I TEASE YOU LIKE THAT.

12:52.242 --> 12:54.544
IT'S JUST SO MUCH FUN.

12:54.544 --> 12:55.976
DID YOU HEAR THAT?

12:55.976 --> 12:58.278
SHE LOVES WHEN WE
FLIRT WITH EACH OTHER!

12:58.278 --> 13:00.811
NO, I DIDN'T HEAR THAT.

13:00.811 --> 13:02.412
I OUGHT TO GO HANG OUT
WITH HER, OKAY?

13:02.412 --> 13:04.414
TELL ME
WHAT SHE LIKES IN GUYS.

13:04.414 --> 13:06.216
UM, NO.

13:06.216 --> 13:08.488
THE DEAL WAS, YOU HANG OUT
HERE WITH ME AND DUSTIN.

13:08.488 --> 13:11.922
I DID.
FOR AN HOUR. YOU'RE
BREAKING THE DEAL.

13:11.922 --> 13:13.924
I DON'T CARE. YOU GIVE
ME THE INFORMATION
ABOUT NIKKI,

13:13.924 --> 13:15.926
OR I TELL DUSTIN
YOU'RE A LOSER.

13:15.926 --> 13:17.397
HE'LL BELIEVE
ANYTHING I SAY.

13:17.397 --> 13:20.931
OKAY. FINE.

13:20.931 --> 13:24.274
NIKKI LIKE'S GUYS
WHO REMIND HER
OF HER GRANDFATHER.

13:24.274 --> 13:26.977
SHE SENT ME A PICTURE
OF HIM. HERE HE IS.

13:26.977 --> 13:29.579
I'LL SEND IT TO YOU
SO YOU DON'T FORGET.

13:29.579 --> 13:31.281
THIS IS
GONNA BE SO USEFUL!

13:35.315 --> 13:36.416
WHA--? WHERE'D TYLER GO?

13:36.416 --> 13:39.189
OH, UH, HE LEFT,
BUT HE WANTS YOU TO STAY.

13:39.189 --> 13:41.021
OH, OKAY.

13:41.021 --> 13:42.522
SO, DO YOU WANT
SOME POPCORN?

13:42.522 --> 13:44.194
POPCORN! DRINKS!

13:44.194 --> 13:46.496
AVERY'S MOM.
I'VE HEARD SO
LITTLE ABOUT YOU.

13:46.496 --> 13:49.229
NO TATTOOS.
NO PIERCINGS.
WELL-GROOMED. OKAY!

13:55.505 --> 13:57.437
SO I GUESS
I'LL SEE YOU AROUND.

13:57.437 --> 13:58.909
YEAH, SEE YOU AT SCHOOL.

13:58.909 --> 14:00.570
THANK YOUR MOM
FOR ALL OF THAT POPCORN.

14:00.570 --> 14:03.173
YEAH, OKAY.

14:03.173 --> 14:05.575
( clicks tongue )

14:12.953 --> 14:15.355
SO?

14:15.355 --> 14:17.187
HOW DID IT GO?

14:17.187 --> 14:19.189
I HAVE NO IDEA.

14:19.189 --> 14:20.860
WHAT DO YOU DO
WHEN YOU'RE WITH A BOY
AND IT ENDS

14:20.860 --> 14:22.893
AND YOU DON'T KNOW
HOW IT WENT OR HOW
HE FEELS

14:22.893 --> 14:24.935
OR WHERE YOU STAND?

14:24.935 --> 14:27.097
I HAVE NO IDEA.

14:35.175 --> 14:37.908
SO, WHAT DO YOU MEAN
YOU DON'T KNOW HOW
IT WENT WITH DUSTIN?

14:37.908 --> 14:41.151
WHAT HAPPENED?
ALL KINDS OF THINGS.

14:41.151 --> 14:43.283
I JUST DON'T KNOW
WHAT THEY MEAN.

14:43.283 --> 14:46.186
WE WATCHED A MOVIE,
AND AT A FUNNY PART,

14:46.186 --> 14:48.058
HE LAUGHED AND PUNCHED ME
IN THE ARM.

14:48.058 --> 14:50.620
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
WAS IT AN EXCUSE
TO TOUCH ME?

14:50.620 --> 14:52.122
WAS HE TREATING ME
LIKE A BUDDY?

14:52.122 --> 14:54.424
WAS HE TRYING TO DISTRACT
ME FROM A FART?

14:56.496 --> 14:58.368
THEN WE WATCHED THE MOVIE
FOR A LONG TIME

14:58.368 --> 15:00.400
WHERE
NOTHING REALLY HAPPENED,

15:00.400 --> 15:02.272
SO WE'LL JUST SKIP
OVER THAT PART.

15:06.636 --> 15:09.239
THEN I YAWNED,
AND HE DIDN'T.

15:09.239 --> 15:10.640
Nikki: YOU WERE BORED?

15:10.640 --> 15:13.643
NO, BUT I HAPPEN
TO KNOW OF A UNIVERSITY
OF PISA STUDY

15:13.643 --> 15:16.116
SHOWING THAT YAWNING
IS CONTAGIOUS AMONG PEOPLE

15:16.116 --> 15:18.248
WHO HAVE
AN EMOTIONAL CONNECTION.

15:18.248 --> 15:21.591
I WANTED TO SEE IF HE FEELS
AN EMOTIONAL CONNECTION.

15:21.591 --> 15:23.653
HE FEELS NO
EMOTIONAL CONNECTION!

15:25.195 --> 15:27.427
NOW ALL THIS TALK ABOUT
CONNECTING WITH YAWNING

15:27.427 --> 15:29.299
IS MAKING ME WANT TO YAWN.

15:35.005 --> 15:36.466
Both: AWWW!

15:38.068 --> 15:39.539
WELL, THEN HE LEFT.

15:39.539 --> 15:42.072
YOU KNOW, I WAS
HOPING THAT AFTER TODAY
HE'D BE MY BOYFRIEND,

15:42.072 --> 15:44.414
BUT NOW I DON'T EVEN
KNOW WHAT WE ARE.

15:44.414 --> 15:47.047
( both sneeze )

15:47.047 --> 15:49.249
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

15:49.249 --> 15:51.151
I THINK WE'RE
GETTING A COLD.

15:51.151 --> 15:53.383
Both: AWWW!

15:55.255 --> 15:56.226
HELLO!

15:59.159 --> 16:01.131
TYLER, YOU LOOK
RIDICULOUS!

16:01.131 --> 16:02.662
WHAT IS THAT?

16:02.662 --> 16:04.964
WHAT, I DON'T LOOK
LIKE YOUR GRANDFATHER?

16:04.964 --> 16:06.566
NO, AND WHY WOULD
YOU WANT TO?

16:06.566 --> 16:08.438
HE WAS FOUR-FOOT-NINE
WITH T. REX ARMS

16:08.438 --> 16:11.271
AND EARS THE SIZE
OF TAMBOURINES.

16:11.271 --> 16:15.245
AVERY TOLD ME YOU LIKE
GUYS WHO REMIND YOU
OF YOUR GRANDFATHER.

16:15.245 --> 16:16.576
SHE SHOWED ME THIS PICTURE.

16:16.576 --> 16:19.079
THAT'S AMBROSE BURNSIDE,

16:19.079 --> 16:21.551
THE UNION GENERAL
FROM AVERY'S REPORT.

16:21.551 --> 16:23.613
I THINK SHE WAS
MESSING WITH YOU.

16:23.613 --> 16:27.287
I WAS JUST TRYING THIS ON
TO SEE IF YOU'D LIKE IT.

16:27.287 --> 16:30.390
GOOD THINK I DIDN'T SPEND
THE REST OF MY LIFE
GROWING ONE!

16:31.761 --> 16:34.664
OW. OW! IT'S STUCK!

16:34.664 --> 16:38.428
I USED THIS GLUE
SO IT WOULDN'T FALL OFF.

16:38.428 --> 16:40.630
( comical shriek )

16:40.630 --> 16:42.772
YOU USED THAT?!

16:42.772 --> 16:44.504
THAT NEVER COMES OFF.

16:44.504 --> 16:47.237
WHY DOESN'T IT SAY THAT
ON THE BOTTLE?

16:47.237 --> 16:48.438
IT DOES.

16:50.310 --> 16:51.741
WHAT'S THE ANTIDOTE?

16:51.741 --> 16:54.284
MORE EDUCATION?

16:55.615 --> 16:57.447
HEY, DAD.

16:57.447 --> 16:58.718
SON.

16:58.718 --> 17:00.250
THAT'S WEIRD.

17:00.250 --> 17:03.293
HE'S NOT MENTIONING
THE CRAZY FACIAL HAIR.

17:03.293 --> 17:06.296
I WONDER WHAT'S UP
WITH THE CRAZY FACIAL HAIR.

17:06.296 --> 17:08.528
SOMETHING TELLS ME
I DON'T WANNA KNOW.

17:08.528 --> 17:11.731
SO, TYLER, DO YOU KNOW
HOW IT WENT WITH AVERY
AND HER FRIEND?

17:11.731 --> 17:13.233
NO, I REALLY DON'T.

17:14.204 --> 17:16.206
HE'S SO CONCERNED
ABOUT AVERY

17:16.206 --> 17:18.208
THAT HE DOESN'T
CARE I'VE GOT
THIS MONKEY BUTT

17:18.208 --> 17:20.370
GLUED TO MY FACE!

17:21.771 --> 17:23.443
HAS HE HAD THAT A LONG TIME

17:23.443 --> 17:26.116
AND I JUST DIDN'T NOTICE?

17:28.047 --> 17:29.319
OH, HEY, STAN.

17:29.319 --> 17:32.152
OH, YOU'RE BACK!
WOW!

17:32.152 --> 17:34.284
LOOK AT THE TIME.
GOTTA GET GOIN'.

17:34.284 --> 17:36.286
STAN, STOP.

17:36.286 --> 17:38.688
GOTTA GO PLAY
SOME CHLOE CHESS.

17:38.688 --> 17:40.560
I JUST CAN'T GET
THAT MONKEY OFF MY BACK.

17:40.560 --> 17:42.692
UNFORTUNATELY, THAT'S
ONE OF HER NEW RULES--

17:42.692 --> 17:45.195
SHE MAKES ME WEAR
A MONKEY ON MY BACK.

17:45.195 --> 17:47.837
WHAT'S GOING ON?
WHY WON'T YOU TALK TO ME?

17:47.837 --> 17:49.369
I DO TALK TO YOU.
I'M TALKING NOW,

17:49.369 --> 17:51.671
AND THAT'S PRETTY
IMPRESSIVE FOR A DOG.

17:51.671 --> 17:53.443
WHAT DO YOU WANT, OPERA?

17:53.443 --> 17:55.275
YOU'RE AVOIDING ME.

17:55.275 --> 17:58.648
( singing Italian opera )

18:04.254 --> 18:05.685
STAN, I JUST--

18:05.685 --> 18:08.258
( singing Italian opera )

18:15.325 --> 18:16.326
GOTTA GO. CIAO.

18:16.326 --> 18:19.169
SIT. STAY.

18:19.169 --> 18:22.332
OH, YOU DID NOT JUST
PUT ME IN A SIT-STAY.

18:22.332 --> 18:24.604
WELL, YOU LEFT ME NO CHOICE.

18:24.604 --> 18:27.607
YOU'VE BEEN AVOIDING ME,
AND I WANT TO KNOW WHY.

18:27.607 --> 18:29.309
I'VE BEEN DEALING
WITH SO MUCH,

18:29.309 --> 18:31.281
AND NO ONE'S BEEN
ABLE TO HELP ME.

18:31.281 --> 18:33.183
YOU'RE MY BEST FRIEND,
STAN.

18:33.183 --> 18:34.814
I NEED YOU.

18:34.814 --> 18:36.816
FINE. YES,
I'M AVOIDING YOU,

18:36.816 --> 18:39.249
BUT IT'S NOT
BECAUSE I DON'T CARE.

18:39.249 --> 18:41.821
IT'S BECAUSE I DO CARE.

18:41.821 --> 18:44.154
WHAT?

18:46.125 --> 18:47.757
LOOK, I LOVE HELPING YOU.

18:47.757 --> 18:50.260
I WANT TO HELP YOU.

18:50.260 --> 18:52.762
BUT I'VE BEEN
AVOIDING YOU BECAUSE...

18:52.762 --> 18:54.834
I'M AFRAID
OF LETTING YOU DOWN.

18:54.834 --> 18:57.167
STAN, YOU NEVER LET ME DOWN.

18:57.167 --> 18:58.308
YEAH, BUT THIS IS DIFFERENT.

18:58.308 --> 19:00.270
I DON'T UNDERSTAND
HUMAN RELATIONSHIPS,

19:00.270 --> 19:02.272
WITH ALL THE GUESSING
AND THE WORRYING

19:02.272 --> 19:04.143
AND THE YAWNING?!

19:04.143 --> 19:06.316
I MEAN, DOGS, WE--

19:06.316 --> 19:08.748
WE DON'T SIT AROUND
WONDERING IF ANOTHER
DOG LIKES US.

19:08.748 --> 19:11.181
WE KEEP IT SIMPLE.
WE GO FOR IT.

19:11.181 --> 19:13.323
I'M SORRY, AVERY.

19:13.323 --> 19:15.185
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO TELL YOU.

19:18.358 --> 19:19.529
YES, STAN.

19:19.529 --> 19:22.292
AS USUAL, YOU DO.

19:22.292 --> 19:24.294
REALLY?

19:24.294 --> 19:26.165
I'M SO HAPPY!

19:26.165 --> 19:28.198
( singing Italian opera )

19:39.579 --> 19:40.810
HEY, AVERY.

19:40.810 --> 19:42.852
YOU WANTED TO MEET ME
BEFORE SCHOOL?

19:42.852 --> 19:44.514
OH, YEAH.

19:44.514 --> 19:46.656
I HAD A GREAT TIME
YESTERDAY.

19:46.656 --> 19:48.358
YEAH. IT WAS A GOOD MOVIE,

19:48.358 --> 19:51.391
AND IT WAS HILARIOUS
WHEN YOU FEEL DOWN THE STAIRS!

19:51.391 --> 19:54.564
SO... WHAT DO YOU WANT
TO TALK ABOUT?

19:54.564 --> 19:57.527
UH, HERE'S THE THING.

19:57.527 --> 20:00.430
OH, THIS IS WAY HARDER
THAN I THOUGHT.

20:00.430 --> 20:02.302
HOW DO I TELL HIM
I LIKE HIM?

20:02.302 --> 20:05.605
I'M SO NERVOUS,
MY GIANT KNEES
ARE SHAKING.

20:05.605 --> 20:07.307
NO, STAN IS RIGHT.

20:07.307 --> 20:09.339
KEEP IT SIMPLE
AND GO FOR IT.

20:09.339 --> 20:12.211
DUSTIN, I LIKE YOU,
AND--
COOL.

20:12.211 --> 20:14.614
I LIKE YOU TOO.
YOU WANNA BE MY GIRLFRIEND?

20:14.614 --> 20:17.547
YEAH, AND I, UH,
I WANTED TO SAY THAT--

20:17.547 --> 20:19.249
WAIT, WHAT?

20:19.249 --> 20:21.421
I LIKE YOU.
YOU'RE AWESOME.

20:21.421 --> 20:23.253
YOU WANNA BE MY GIRLFRIEND?

20:23.253 --> 20:26.726
UH... YES.
YES, I DO.

20:26.726 --> 20:27.797
COOL.

20:32.762 --> 20:36.406
( imitating explosions )

20:36.406 --> 20:40.009
YES! AVERY JENNINGS
IS MY GIRLFRIEND!

20:40.009 --> 20:41.541
SEE YOU AT SCHOOL.

20:45.315 --> 20:48.378
I HAVE A BOYFRIEND.
BE COOL.

20:48.378 --> 20:51.721
I'M COOL.
I'M ALWAYS COOL.

20:51.721 --> 20:52.982
IF HE HURTS
MY LITTLE GIRL,

20:52.982 --> 20:55.325
I'M GONNA TWIST HIM
INTO A PRETZEL.

20:55.325 --> 20:59.559
OH, A PRETZEL WOULD
BE GREAT RIGHT NOW!

21:00.890 --> 21:02.762
Stan: IT WAS GREAT
TO HELP MY BEST FRIEND

21:02.762 --> 21:05.565
FIGURE OUT
THE RULES OF LOVE.

21:05.565 --> 21:07.997
SPEAKING OF LOVE,
I STARTED THINKING
ABOUT THAT POODLE

21:07.997 --> 21:11.341
AS I WAS FLIPPING
THROUGH AVERY'S
HISTORY BOOK.

21:11.341 --> 21:13.673
ABRAHAM LINCOLN.

21:13.673 --> 21:16.005
JULIUS CAESAR.

21:16.005 --> 21:18.348
SACAGAWEA.

21:18.348 --> 21:20.450
SECRETARIAT.

21:20.450 --> 21:23.613
YEP, EVERYBODY LOOKS
BETTER WITH A POODLE-DO.

21:28.318 --> 21:30.420
OH, HEY, NIKKI,
WHAT'S UP?

21:30.420 --> 21:33.363
YOU STILL CAN'T GET
THAT OFF?

21:33.363 --> 21:35.495
NO, SO I DECIDED
TO PUT ON THIS UNIFORM

21:35.495 --> 21:38.728
AND PRETEND IT WAS ALL
PART OF A SCHOOL PROJECT.

21:38.728 --> 21:40.330
THAT'S VERY SMART.

21:40.330 --> 21:42.031
REALLY? YOU THINK SO?

21:42.031 --> 21:45.034
WELL, FOR A BOY WHO
THOUGHT MY GRANDFATHER
WAS A CIVIL WAR GENERAL

21:45.034 --> 21:47.637
AND PERMANENTLY GLUED
HAIR TO HIS FACE,

21:47.637 --> 21:49.709
ANYTHING IS SMART.

21:49.709 --> 21:51.741
THANK YOU.

21:51.741 --> 21:53.943
THE WEIRD THING IS,
IT'S KIND OF CAUGHT ON

21:53.943 --> 21:56.486
WHAT SOME OF THE YOUNGER
KIDS WHO LOOK UP TO ME.

21:56.486 --> 21:57.647
HEY, TYLER.

22:01.451 --> 22:02.622
I WIN!

22:07.357 --> 22:08.398
I WIN!

22:12.862 --> 22:15.535
BOOP! I WIN!

22:15.535 --> 22:17.006
HEY, THAT'S CHLOE CHESS.

22:17.006 --> 22:18.668
I DIDN'T MAKE THE RULES.

22:18.668 --> 22:21.871
YES, I DID.

22:21.871 --> 22:23.112
( laughing )
