WEBVTT

00:05.338 --> 00:08.258
(over speaker): Okay,
the theme to tonight's show

00:08.341 --> 00:09.592
is "Love Stinks,"

00:09.676 --> 00:12.095
so if Cupid has
screwed you over lately,

00:12.178 --> 00:15.557
please pick up the phone
and let us know.

00:15.640 --> 00:18.810
(mellow rock playing)

00:25.900 --> 00:27.777
MAN:
Oh, yeah!

00:27.861 --> 00:29.904
{\an1}Yeah, man.

00:31.740 --> 00:33.408
{\an1}Yeah!

00:34.659 --> 00:36.661
{\an3}Whoa-ho!

00:36.745 --> 00:38.288
(exhales)

00:42.709 --> 00:45.712
{\an3}I can't believe I actually
had fun at "Cabaret on Ice."

00:45.795 --> 00:46.796
Are you kidding?

00:46.880 --> 00:49.632
{\an1}You're not the one who bought
the souvenir key chain.

00:49.716 --> 00:50.967
You didn't.

00:51.050 --> 00:52.719
I did. Hey, Gina.

00:52.802 --> 00:53.845
Hi.

00:53.928 --> 00:55.388
These are for you.

00:55.472 --> 00:57.682
Oh, that's so nice.

00:57.766 --> 01:00.226
Makes me feel like I won
the Olympics after all.

01:00.310 --> 01:02.145
Kelly Taylor,
Gina Kincaid, my cousin.

01:02.228 --> 01:02.771
Hi.
Hi.

01:02.854 --> 01:04.272
Sixes all across the board

01:04.355 --> 01:05.522
on the triple axel.

01:05.607 --> 01:07.650
{\an4}Nah.
Definitely. I've heard
a lot about you.

01:07.734 --> 01:09.152
{\an3}Well, don't believe
more than half.

01:09.235 --> 01:11.613
{\an3}Donna's always been
at least 50% too nice.

01:11.696 --> 01:13.531
{\an1}(laughs)
Gina.

01:14.365 --> 01:15.784
We have to talk.

01:15.867 --> 01:17.827
{\an3}Yeah. Hey, Arty, uh,
this is my cousin Donna

01:17.911 --> 01:18.745
and her friend Kelly.

01:18.828 --> 01:20.663
{\an3}Guys, this is Arty,
the show manager.

01:20.747 --> 01:22.791
Charmed.

01:26.419 --> 01:28.338
{\an1}Now, what is
the story on your

01:28.421 --> 01:29.672
missed entrance
in the second act?

01:29.756 --> 01:31.716
Nerves-- I had family
in the audience.

01:31.800 --> 01:33.009
Don't give me
that "nerves" crap.

01:33.092 --> 01:34.052
It's your attitude.

01:34.135 --> 01:35.637
Yeah, well,
this second-rung stuff

01:35.720 --> 01:38.014
is killing me-- I'm better
than that, and you know it.

01:38.097 --> 01:38.807
Prove it.

01:38.890 --> 01:39.974
Until then,

01:40.058 --> 01:41.434
I'm keeping you
in the chorus.

01:41.518 --> 01:43.686
{\an3}What are you talking about?
You promised me a lead.

01:43.770 --> 01:44.979
(laughs)

01:45.063 --> 01:47.106
(laughs)

01:47.190 --> 01:50.151
{\an4}Do I have to go
over your head on this?
No.

01:50.235 --> 01:51.319
'Cause you're fired.

02:02.956 --> 02:04.165
Hi.

02:04.249 --> 02:05.792
He seems quite perky.

02:05.875 --> 02:07.210
Oh, Arty's a jerk.

02:07.293 --> 02:08.836
He's always on my back.

02:08.919 --> 02:10.713
Anything we can do?

02:10.797 --> 02:13.049
You can congratulate me.

02:13.132 --> 02:14.384
I quit.

02:14.467 --> 02:16.094
(laughs)

02:18.972 --> 02:21.266
Here's my shoulder--
cry on it.

02:21.349 --> 02:23.601
(crying):
Hi.

02:23.685 --> 02:26.729
I'm Denise,
and I hate my parents.

02:26.813 --> 02:28.731
They're never around--
they don't care what I do,

02:28.815 --> 02:30.400
as long as I'm miserable.

02:30.483 --> 02:32.402
Anyway, they made me
break up with my boyfriend.

02:32.485 --> 02:34.070
Really? Why is that?

02:34.153 --> 02:36.406
My dad caught us sneaking beers.

02:36.489 --> 02:39.409
Ooh, scammin' Dad's booze--
that's a horrible idea.

02:39.492 --> 02:41.244
Scott's already dating
someone else.

02:41.327 --> 02:42.579
Denise...

02:42.662 --> 02:45.582
there's only one

02:45.665 --> 02:47.876
solution to that
particular problem.

02:49.210 --> 02:50.712
Move on.

02:50.795 --> 02:53.339
DENISE (over radio):
My life is completely fractal.

02:53.423 --> 02:55.925
{\an5}DAVID:
I'm telling you,
Scott is a loser.

02:56.009 --> 02:58.803
DENISE:
Maybe. I just wish my parents

02:58.887 --> 03:00.430
would stay out of my life.

03:00.513 --> 03:02.765
Amen. Amen to that, sister.

03:02.849 --> 03:04.601
{\an5}DAVID:
Here's an idea--
(horn honks)

03:04.684 --> 03:08.104
pick up the classifieds and
look in the "For Rent" section

03:08.187 --> 03:10.189
and plan your escape.
(tires squeal)

03:12.859 --> 03:15.111
(loud crash)

03:15.194 --> 03:17.405
♪ ♪

03:44.223 --> 03:46.184
♪ ♪

04:10.083 --> 04:11.960
♪ ♪

04:20.760 --> 04:23.054
♪ ♪

04:57.463 --> 04:59.590
{\an3}Up and at 'em,
sunshine.

04:59.674 --> 05:02.051
{\an3}Heard you tied one
on last night,

05:02.135 --> 05:03.219
pyrotechnics and all.

05:03.302 --> 05:05.346
I don't remember anything,
except I acted like an idiot.

05:05.430 --> 05:07.056
{\an3}Well, not a
complete idiot.

05:07.140 --> 05:09.017
{\an6}There was a
hit-and-run last
night about a mile

05:09.100 --> 05:11.269
{\an5}from the club--
you were smart
to crash here.

05:11.352 --> 05:13.813
{\an3}Some poor guy
got really hurt.

05:18.818 --> 05:22.572
{\an6}Hey, listen, I'm returning
a dress at your honey's
place, so I'll be back.

05:22.655 --> 05:26.242
{\an6}And, oh, I'm hosting
Thanksgiving, so are
you bringing the wine?

05:26.325 --> 05:29.037
{\an5}Whatever.
Ooh, you got a little
battle scar there.

05:29.120 --> 05:31.956
{\an4}I hit my head
on the bar.
All right.

05:32.040 --> 05:33.041
Well, I'll see you.

05:33.124 --> 05:34.751
All right.

05:38.129 --> 05:39.922
(quietly):
Oh, man.

05:42.675 --> 05:44.802
(sighs)

05:44.886 --> 05:46.262
Oh, God.

05:48.973 --> 05:51.100
Oh, man.

05:51.184 --> 05:53.269
{\an5}GINA:
<i>Promised my agent</i>
<i>I'd meet him later for drinks.</i>

05:53.352 --> 05:56.105
He's a bit of a scenester.
Any suggestions?

05:56.189 --> 05:58.566
{\an3}Oh, yeah, the After Dark--
it's right next-door,

05:58.649 --> 06:00.109
{\an3}and it's my
boyfriend's club.

06:00.193 --> 06:02.737
Boyfriend? <i> Oh,</i>
you told me about the boutique

06:02.820 --> 06:04.405
but not about the boyfriend.

06:04.489 --> 06:06.574
Yeah. It's been
kind of complex lately,

06:06.657 --> 06:08.701
but I'll spare you
the sordid details.

06:08.785 --> 06:10.078
{\an3}(laughs)
What?

06:10.161 --> 06:12.413
It's... it's just
hard for me to imagine

06:12.497 --> 06:14.082
anything in your life
being sordid.

06:14.165 --> 06:15.625
It always seems so perfect.

06:15.708 --> 06:17.960
Mm.

06:18.044 --> 06:19.170
Morning, ladies.

06:19.253 --> 06:20.004
Morning.

06:20.088 --> 06:21.297
Oh. It's on me.

06:21.380 --> 06:22.465
Ah.

06:22.548 --> 06:24.133
Mm.

06:25.176 --> 06:26.469
Hey.

06:26.552 --> 06:27.261
Hey.

06:27.345 --> 06:28.096
(chuckles)

06:28.179 --> 06:29.972
Hi. Whoa.

06:30.056 --> 06:31.808
{\an1}(clears throat
loudly)

06:31.891 --> 06:33.226
What was that?

06:33.309 --> 06:34.811
What was what?
Hi. I'm Steve.

06:34.894 --> 06:36.020
{\an1}Ah. Gina.
Nice to meet you.

06:36.104 --> 06:37.188
What, Donna?

06:37.271 --> 06:40.024
{\an4}Oh, nothing--
just that little chin
thing she was doing.

06:40.108 --> 06:41.234
It was nothing.

06:41.317 --> 06:43.653
We had a little, you know,
working breakfast, that's all.

06:43.736 --> 06:44.987
{\an1}DONNA:
Mm, before noon.

06:45.071 --> 06:46.364
Hmm, nice try.

06:46.447 --> 06:47.990
No, that was all, really.

06:48.074 --> 06:49.283
{\an1}Oh. Okay.

06:49.367 --> 06:51.244
{\an1}You know those boys
that had commitment fears,

06:51.327 --> 06:54.163
{\an5}like, even way back
in the eighth grade?
The ones who said

06:54.247 --> 06:56.666
they'd go out with us as long
as we didn't tell anyone?

06:56.749 --> 06:58.376
{\an1}That's how they turned
out, right here.

06:58.459 --> 07:00.336
Ha-ha.
Excuse me.

07:00.419 --> 07:02.547
{\an1}We had sex, okay?
I got her name right--

07:02.630 --> 07:04.757
{\an4}I don't see where
the problem is.
My bad.

07:06.926 --> 07:08.678
(doorbell tinkles)

07:08.761 --> 07:12.306
Noah, hey, uh,
this is Gina.

07:12.390 --> 07:14.392
Not right now, okay?

07:15.977 --> 07:18.646
{\an5}Uh, let me guess-
the wrong guy in
the eighth grade,

07:18.729 --> 07:20.189
the one we always fell for.

07:20.273 --> 07:21.899
Yeah. Exactly.

07:21.983 --> 07:22.900
Who is he?

07:22.984 --> 07:24.068
Oh.

07:24.152 --> 07:25.361
Just my boyfriend.

07:31.659 --> 07:33.578
(sighs):
Good as new.

07:33.661 --> 07:36.205
{\an3}Valerie, you are
a class act.

07:36.289 --> 07:38.332
At least you return
the things you steal.

07:38.416 --> 07:41.210
Listen, I need to come over
to the Walshes house later.

07:41.294 --> 07:43.671
What, did you misplace your key,
or lost it in the divorce?

07:43.754 --> 07:45.047
No, I talked to Brandon.

07:45.131 --> 07:47.258
He got his place in D.C.,
and he wants me

07:47.341 --> 07:49.135
{\an3}to send him the
rest of his stuff.

07:49.218 --> 07:50.428
Okay. Well, it's
in the dining room.

07:50.511 --> 07:52.054
Steve dumped it there
in his mad dash

07:52.138 --> 07:54.098
{\an1}for the master suite.
How's 9:00?

07:54.182 --> 07:55.558
Yeah, whenever.

07:55.641 --> 07:58.019
Oh, listen, um, Thanksgiving
this week-- I'm hosting.

07:58.102 --> 08:00.062
Hey. Walsh house,
Thanksgiving.

08:00.146 --> 08:01.397
Uh, love to.

08:01.480 --> 08:02.940
Okay. Kel?

08:03.024 --> 08:04.984
I'll let you know.

08:05.067 --> 08:06.235
{\an3}Okay. Bye.

08:06.319 --> 08:08.571
{\an5}Hi.
Hey. Could you
do me a favor?

08:08.654 --> 08:10.948
{\an5}Sure.
Could you remind Donna
about tomorrow's dance lesson?

08:11.032 --> 08:12.408
Okay.

08:12.491 --> 08:13.826
{\an1}Oh, it's, uh, see,
it's my grandparents'

08:13.910 --> 08:17.788
{\an4}50th wedding anniversary,
and I want to wow Nana
with a mean box step.

08:17.872 --> 08:19.040
Donna agreed to help.

08:19.123 --> 08:21.083
All right, I will be
sure to tell Ginger

08:21.167 --> 08:22.376
that you called, Fred.

08:22.460 --> 08:23.586
{\an1}All right.

08:23.669 --> 08:25.046
{\an1}Um...

08:25.129 --> 08:28.216
{\an1}you know, you should
reconsider Thanksgiving.

08:28.299 --> 08:29.217
Why?

08:29.300 --> 08:31.177
Be nice to see you there.

08:38.183 --> 08:39.769
{\an3}I got next week's
cover story.

08:39.852 --> 08:40.895
{\an3}You ready?

08:40.977 --> 08:43.606
{\an3}Justin and Terry Olson;
they're married 15 years.

08:43.688 --> 08:45.775
{\an3}The catch is, she's
allergic to him.

08:45.858 --> 08:47.944
{\an3}They have sex, she gets
hives. It's perfect.

08:48.027 --> 08:49.278
It's terrible--
there's no sex.

08:49.362 --> 08:51.072
{\an3}(groans): Oh, your
worst nightmare.

08:51.155 --> 08:53.658
{\an1}Janet, a friend of mine says
that two mature adults

08:53.741 --> 08:55.826
{\an4}can't have sex without
immediately having
commitment issues.

08:55.910 --> 08:57.328
{\an1}What do you think?
Wrong.

08:57.411 --> 09:01.457
{\an5}I think you're right.
Yeah, a bed-buddy situation
is entirely possible

09:01.540 --> 09:04.585
{\an3}as long as both people are
clear on the parameters.

09:04.669 --> 09:06.128
Bed buddies?
Parameters?

09:06.212 --> 09:08.256
{\an3}Mm-hmm. The rules
of engagement.

09:08.339 --> 09:10.174
{\an3}For instance, I'm sure
that you find me

09:10.258 --> 09:12.134
{\an3}equally as annoying
as I find you.

09:12.218 --> 09:13.803
{\an1}Heck, yeah-- you're always
correcting my grammar.

09:13.886 --> 09:15.096
{\an3}You're always
cracking your neck.

09:15.179 --> 09:16.973
You're stubborn.
You tell horrible jokes.

09:17.056 --> 09:19.308
You write in green pen.

09:21.269 --> 09:22.186
Oh, yeah.

09:22.270 --> 09:24.021
(laughs)
Oh, yeah.

09:24.105 --> 09:28.484
Well, the sex obviously
hasn't changed <i> our</i> relationship.

09:30.695 --> 09:32.822
Arty'd had enough.

09:32.905 --> 09:35.116
{\an1}Yeah, well,
I was being demoted.

09:35.199 --> 09:36.867
{\an1}Chris, see,
you're my agent--

09:36.951 --> 09:37.994
that's supposed to upset you.

09:38.077 --> 09:39.620
I'm supposed to get you work.

09:39.704 --> 09:41.998
{\an3}I can't do that when
you get a bad reputation.

09:42.081 --> 09:44.834
(laughs): What, from Arty
bad-mouthing me? Please.

09:44.917 --> 09:48.421
{\an3}Wait, wh-what are there,
two, three ice shows, max?

09:48.504 --> 09:49.880
{\an3}It's not like you got
a lot of options.

09:49.964 --> 09:51.507
{\an1}I don't care--
there has to be something.

09:51.591 --> 09:53.759
And I hope you find it.

09:55.261 --> 09:58.180
What, are you... dropping me?

09:58.264 --> 09:59.557
If you need anything...

10:00.975 --> 10:03.060
I need a job.

10:03.144 --> 10:05.229
If you need anything <i> else,</i>

10:05.313 --> 10:06.355
you can always call.

10:13.779 --> 10:14.989
Hey.

10:15.072 --> 10:17.033
Is that your agent?

10:17.116 --> 10:20.077
Oh, uh, yeah, he's, you know,
he's always on the run,

10:20.161 --> 10:22.038
late for the next
big power meeting.

10:22.121 --> 10:23.914
You okay?

10:23.998 --> 10:25.374
(sighs):
Sorry.

10:25.458 --> 10:27.918
I-I... I had to fire Chris,

10:28.002 --> 10:29.211
{\an1}and it was
just really hard.

10:29.295 --> 10:31.672
He's been with me
from the very beginning.

10:31.756 --> 10:33.716
Oh. Yeah, that's terrible.

10:33.799 --> 10:37.219
Yeah. He just wanted me
to take some new gig right away.

10:37.303 --> 10:39.180
{\an1}Truth is, I'm
just burned out,

10:39.263 --> 10:42.516
so... I told him that,
and he freaked.

10:43.684 --> 10:45.061
Hey.

10:45.144 --> 10:46.228
{\an3}Hey.

10:46.312 --> 10:48.230
{\an3}You called;
I'm here.

10:48.314 --> 10:49.940
{\an1}I'm Noah.
Hi.

10:50.024 --> 10:50.983
I'm Gina.

10:51.067 --> 10:52.902
Gina, can you give us a second?

10:52.985 --> 10:55.112
Yeah.

10:55.196 --> 10:57.573
Thanks.

10:57.656 --> 11:00.076
{\an3}Look...

11:00.159 --> 11:01.577
Oh, my God! What...

11:01.660 --> 11:03.204
Are you okay?

11:03.287 --> 11:04.914
{\an1}I had an accident,
all right?

11:04.997 --> 11:05.706
What?

11:05.790 --> 11:08.459
I was driving home
and I blacked out.

11:08.542 --> 11:10.044
I don't remember anything.

11:11.295 --> 11:13.130
I think I hit somebody.

11:15.174 --> 11:17.218
{\an3}Oh...

11:23.057 --> 11:24.850
Yeah. Can I help you?

11:24.934 --> 11:30.189
No. I just wanted to see if you
look as sexy as you sound.

11:31.524 --> 11:32.441
Mind turning around for me?

11:32.525 --> 11:34.068
(chuckles)

11:34.151 --> 11:37.113
Uh, you know, I'm kind of
in the middle of doing

11:37.196 --> 11:39.407
a whole bunch of stuff.

11:39.490 --> 11:42.618
{\an3}Do they unchain you
from these turntables

11:42.701 --> 11:44.161
long enough for a dance break?

11:47.039 --> 11:47.998
No.

11:48.082 --> 11:49.834
No, unfortunately, they don't.

11:54.213 --> 11:55.631
Then we'll just have
to improvise.

12:10.771 --> 12:14.775
{\an1}Okay, we've got his books,
his pictures...

12:14.859 --> 12:17.153
{\an3}Mmm. Ooh, these
are love letters.

12:17.236 --> 12:18.320
Give me those.

12:18.404 --> 12:21.991
{\an3}(chuckles)
Smiley face. That's so cute.

12:22.074 --> 12:23.826
{\an1}Mmm. I remember
when I sent him this one.

12:23.909 --> 12:26.328
{\an1}He was visiting his parents
in Hong Kong.

12:26.412 --> 12:31.667
And this one I hand delivered to
<i>The Beat</i> because I missed him.

12:31.750 --> 12:34.044
{\an3}Oh, how Brandon
and Kelly of you.

12:34.128 --> 12:36.130
This one, I don't...

12:36.213 --> 12:38.174
Is from you.

12:38.257 --> 12:39.842
{\an3}I never sent him
a love letter.

12:39.925 --> 12:43.637
{\an1}"I love you, Brandon,
like a sister.

12:43.721 --> 12:45.681
"So, when I tell you
that marrying Kelly

12:45.764 --> 12:47.016
is a bad idea..."

12:47.099 --> 12:48.893
Uh, you might want
to give me that.

12:48.976 --> 12:51.854
"I'm saying it for your own
good. You should want more."

12:52.897 --> 12:53.981
I'm sorry I said that.

12:54.064 --> 12:57.359
So, you gave Brandon the idea
to call off the wedding.

12:57.443 --> 12:58.652
No, I didn't. I didn't.

12:58.736 --> 13:01.071
He just... wanted my opinion.

13:01.155 --> 13:02.531
Valerie, you are such a bitch.

13:02.615 --> 13:03.532
Well, let me explain.

13:03.616 --> 13:05.659
Don't even try.

13:06.744 --> 13:09.038
(sighs)

13:09.121 --> 13:11.165
(door opening and closing)

13:15.961 --> 13:18.547
I know this is hard, but you're
doing the right thing, okay?

13:18.631 --> 13:21.217
(phone ringing)

13:21.300 --> 13:23.344
(sighs)

13:25.596 --> 13:27.181
I'm here about the hit and
run from the other night.

13:27.264 --> 13:29.141
You got some info
on the guy who did it?

13:29.225 --> 13:30.601
Yeah.

13:30.684 --> 13:31.936
You're looking at him.

13:40.361 --> 13:43.364
(birds chirping)

13:47.660 --> 13:48.953
(door creaking)

13:49.036 --> 13:50.746
{\an1}Busted.

13:50.829 --> 13:52.915
(laughing)

13:52.998 --> 13:54.124
{\an1}It's my low-rent
alarm system.

13:54.208 --> 13:56.418
Sorry. Overslept.

13:56.502 --> 13:57.878
I'll call you.

13:57.962 --> 13:59.296
That means you won't, right?

14:00.381 --> 14:03.092
I'm not too up
on the one-night-stand lingo.

14:10.808 --> 14:12.059
{\an3}David?
Yes.

14:12.142 --> 14:14.144
{\an3}I'll call.

14:20.109 --> 14:21.610
(sighs)

14:21.694 --> 14:23.445
(chuckles)

14:23.529 --> 14:25.531
(pager beeping)

14:33.539 --> 14:35.082
(beeping stops)

14:35.165 --> 14:37.167
(engine starting)

14:37.251 --> 14:40.004
(groans)
She forgot her beeper.

14:40.087 --> 14:42.756
(car driving away)

14:42.840 --> 14:44.842
(sighs)

14:57.187 --> 14:59.023
(line ringing)

14:59.106 --> 15:00.316
(phone rings)

15:00.399 --> 15:01.942
Denise?

15:02.026 --> 15:04.278
No. No. She's not here.

15:04.361 --> 15:05.988
Who's this?

15:06.071 --> 15:08.657
Just a friend.
She-She left her pager here.

15:08.741 --> 15:11.660
If you leave a message, I can
try and track her down for you.

15:11.744 --> 15:14.163
No, don't bother. She's
probably on her way home now.

15:14.246 --> 15:17.541
Who is this?
Her roommate?

15:17.625 --> 15:20.294
No. I'm her mother.

15:20.377 --> 15:22.171
And I suggest you stay away

15:22.254 --> 15:24.506
from Denise-- she's 17.

15:24.590 --> 15:26.592
(line disconnects)

15:28.093 --> 15:30.137
(phone beeps off)

15:32.389 --> 15:34.308
KELLY:
<i>Did they press charges?</i>

15:34.391 --> 15:36.352
{\an3}No, but they questioned
him half the night.

15:36.435 --> 15:38.145
And you're here,
folding sweaters?

15:38.228 --> 15:39.897
A welcome distraction.

15:39.980 --> 15:42.399
{\an3}Unlike, let's say,
dance class

15:42.483 --> 15:45.527
{\an3}with Matt, which I really
can't handle right now.

15:45.611 --> 15:47.696
{\an1}Kel, um,
can I talk to you?

15:47.780 --> 15:49.698
{\an1}No, you lost that privilege
last night.

15:49.782 --> 15:52.242
Listen, I will talk to Matt
about the dance classes.

15:52.326 --> 15:54.161
You have enough on your mind.
Thanks.

15:56.163 --> 15:58.999
Well, the queen sure likes
her subjects to grovel.

15:59.083 --> 16:01.335
Val, you told Brandon
not to marry her.

16:01.418 --> 16:04.046
{\an3}That's, like, the cruelest
thing you've ever done.

16:04.129 --> 16:04.922
{\an3}How is she supposed
to take that lightly?

16:05.005 --> 16:07.383
{\an1}You're right.
It is a jagged little pill.

16:07.466 --> 16:08.759
(sighs)

16:08.842 --> 16:10.052
Brandon's gone now.

16:10.135 --> 16:11.220
What's that supposed to mean?

16:11.303 --> 16:14.181
Well, it just seemed like
he was your guardian angel,

16:14.264 --> 16:15.391
always smoothing over
your mistakes.

16:15.474 --> 16:16.600
Well, he's gone.

16:16.684 --> 16:19.478
{\an3}So, if I were you,
I'd either behave myself

16:19.561 --> 16:21.855
or find a new group of friends.

16:28.654 --> 16:30.656
(soft upbeat music playing)

16:38.622 --> 16:39.623
(knocking)

16:39.707 --> 16:41.417
Hey.
Hi.

16:41.500 --> 16:43.127
{\an1}(chuckles)

16:43.210 --> 16:44.628
{\an1}(sighs)

16:44.712 --> 16:45.963
May I help you?

16:46.046 --> 16:48.048
Yeah. Do you have an
antidote for Valerie?

16:48.132 --> 16:49.091
{\an1}Uh, yeah.
Get to know her better.

16:49.174 --> 16:50.259
{\an3}Listen, um,

16:50.342 --> 16:52.094
{\an3}Donna wanted me to
come up and tell you

16:52.177 --> 16:53.846
{\an3}that she's got some
stuff going on

16:53.929 --> 16:55.264
and she's not going to be
able to make it tonight.

16:55.347 --> 16:56.432
{\an1}Oh...

16:56.515 --> 17:00.310
She said she's
really sorry.

17:00.394 --> 17:01.478
{\an1}You know, for some things,
you don't mind

17:01.562 --> 17:02.730
making a fool of yourself.

17:02.813 --> 17:04.106
{\an3}Yeah.

17:04.189 --> 17:06.775
{\an1}Well, I decided dance class
just wasn't one of them.

17:06.858 --> 17:07.943
{\an3}(laughing)

17:08.026 --> 17:10.069
{\an3}Oh, come on. You
can't be that bad.

17:10.154 --> 17:11.488
No. I'm-I'm bad.

17:11.571 --> 17:12.781
{\an3}Really?

17:12.865 --> 17:14.324
{\an1}Yeah. Wait. What are you...
What are you doing?

17:14.407 --> 17:16.577
{\an3}Let's see.
Wait, no, no.

17:16.660 --> 17:19.079
{\an3}Come on, dazzle me. Maybe
I'll be your polka partner.

17:19.163 --> 17:20.289
Are you insured?
(laughs)

17:20.372 --> 17:21.915
{\an1}Yeah?

17:21.999 --> 17:22.958
{\an3}Okay.

17:23.040 --> 17:24.126
Just put your hand here.
Okay.

17:24.209 --> 17:25.042
Good.
All right.

17:25.127 --> 17:27.045
Now, just do what I do.
All right. Good.

17:27.128 --> 17:29.131
Yeah. Just, um...

17:29.214 --> 17:31.175
{\an3}Loosen up your-your
hips a little.

17:31.258 --> 17:32.176
My hips?
Yeah.

17:32.259 --> 17:33.635
{\an3}Okay. Good.

17:33.719 --> 17:34.803
So, that's it?
Yeah.

17:34.887 --> 17:36.847
Now, come with me this way.

17:36.930 --> 17:38.640
This way. Oh.

17:38.724 --> 17:39.641
{\an3}Look. See?

17:39.725 --> 17:41.018
Yeah. What if I do this?

17:41.101 --> 17:42.478
{\an3}That works.

17:42.561 --> 17:43.979
{\an3}(laughing)

17:44.062 --> 17:45.272
Oh. All right.

17:45.355 --> 17:47.733
I'll just keep doing this.

17:47.816 --> 17:49.943
<i>Can you hug or</i>

17:50.027 --> 17:50.819
snuggle or kiss?

17:50.903 --> 17:54.740
{\an1}Oh, yeah. Until I feel
an itch coming on.

17:57.242 --> 17:58.702
Why do you guys stay together?

17:58.786 --> 18:00.829
We love each other.

18:00.913 --> 18:03.165
Nothing we can do about that.

18:03.248 --> 18:06.001
{\an1}Yes.
Well, that about covers it.

18:06.085 --> 18:08.170
{\an1}Um, thanks so much
for coming in.

18:08.253 --> 18:09.338
I'll give you a call,

18:09.421 --> 18:11.173
{\an1}if I think of anything else.
Okay?

18:11.256 --> 18:13.967
You guys tried all the ointments
and everything, right?

18:14.051 --> 18:16.011
{\an3}Ointments, salves,
balms, creams.

18:16.095 --> 18:17.012
Acupuncture.

18:17.096 --> 18:20.057
Latex?

18:20.140 --> 18:22.017
That is depressing.

18:22.100 --> 18:23.894
An impossible love story?

18:23.977 --> 18:25.646
I think it's romantic.

18:25.729 --> 18:28.023
{\an3}This coming from a woman
who's coined the term

18:28.106 --> 18:29.149
"bed buddies."

18:29.233 --> 18:30.984
{\an1}I need 1,000 words
by tomorrow.

18:31.068 --> 18:33.695
{\an1}Downplay
the doctor's explanation.

18:33.779 --> 18:35.864
{\an1}But describe her condition
in gory detail, okay?

18:35.948 --> 18:37.032
{\an3}Will do.

18:37.115 --> 18:38.200
{\an1}And Janet?

18:38.283 --> 18:39.827
How about dinner?

18:39.910 --> 18:41.161
{\an1}We could discuss
the sea monster sighting.

18:41.245 --> 18:42.704
{\an3}(laughs)

18:42.788 --> 18:44.373
{\an3}Sorry. I think that's
against the rules.

18:44.456 --> 18:46.500
I mean, by definition,

18:46.583 --> 18:49.878
{\an3}our interaction is
strictly physical, right?

18:49.962 --> 18:52.840
So there's no emotional
investment whatsoever.

18:52.923 --> 18:54.383
{\an3}And besides, I already
have a date tonight.

18:54.466 --> 18:57.052
{\an1}So you're suggesting
we combine monogamous sex

18:57.135 --> 18:58.178
with rampant dating?

18:58.262 --> 19:00.097
Yeah. This offends you?
It could.

19:00.180 --> 19:02.516
{\an3}I'll, um... I'll call
you when he drops me off,

19:02.599 --> 19:04.935
and, Steve, be prepared.

19:06.353 --> 19:08.063
(slapping, groaning)

19:08.146 --> 19:10.399
(growls)

19:12.818 --> 19:14.611
{\an5}WOMAN (over PA):
Tony, we need
a price check on two.

19:14.695 --> 19:15.863
Price check on two.

19:15.946 --> 19:17.197
Hey, Val.
Hey.

19:17.281 --> 19:18.240
{\an1}What's up?

19:18.323 --> 19:21.034
{\an3}Um, nothing. Just getting
stuff for Thursday.

19:21.118 --> 19:22.995
{\an1}Yeah. Kelly's got me
grabbing some stuff, too.

19:23.078 --> 19:25.581
{\an3}Well, uh, Thanksgiving's
at the Walsh house.

19:25.664 --> 19:27.124
No. Kelly called

19:27.207 --> 19:28.584
{\an1}and said everybody was going
to the beach apartment.

19:28.667 --> 19:29.751
Well, they're not.

19:29.835 --> 19:33.255
{\an5}MAN:
Grab me that pumpkin.
That big one over there.

19:37.301 --> 19:40.178
Everybody knows
about the letter you wrote.

19:42.639 --> 19:43.432
It was pretty harsh,
even for you.

19:43.515 --> 19:44.808
{\an3}Brandon was
asking everybody

19:44.892 --> 19:47.561
for advice.
I'm sorry if I'm the only one

19:47.644 --> 19:49.146
who has guts
to tell him the truth.

19:50.564 --> 19:52.482
You know what?
Forget it.

19:52.566 --> 19:53.609
I-I don't care.

19:53.692 --> 19:55.110
I could call Kelly.

19:55.193 --> 19:57.112
No. No. It's okay.
It's okay. Um...

19:57.195 --> 19:58.947
{\an3}I got the last
of the yams,

19:59.031 --> 20:00.282
{\an3}so you should
probably take those.

20:00.365 --> 20:02.784
And, um, cranberry sauce.
(muttering in protest)

20:02.868 --> 20:04.578
You should take that
and-and green beans.

20:04.661 --> 20:06.121
{\an5}Val.
I've got this great
recipe for that.

20:06.204 --> 20:07.748
I've got all...
And a baster.

20:07.831 --> 20:08.957
You need the baster.
Val.

20:09.041 --> 20:10.459
{\an3}And dressing,
yeah. Dressing.

20:10.542 --> 20:14.755
{\an3}And, you know what?
You need the turkey pan.

20:16.256 --> 20:17.299
God, I hate her.

20:17.382 --> 20:19.301
(sighs)

20:22.221 --> 20:23.680
{\an5}GINA:
<i>With the buyout deal</i>
<i>I'm negotiating</i>

20:23.764 --> 20:25.641
{\an1}with the cabaret,
I'll be able to take my time

20:25.724 --> 20:27.935
{\an1}deciding which offer to take.
Here you go.

20:28.018 --> 20:29.478
Okay, selfishly,

20:29.561 --> 20:31.271
I hope you take the one in LA.

20:31.355 --> 20:32.648
It would be like old times,
you know?

20:32.731 --> 20:34.316
Oh. Yeah. Right.

20:34.399 --> 20:36.485
You in Beverly Hills and me
on the other side of the tracks.

20:36.568 --> 20:38.820
Come on.
I never saw it like that.

20:38.904 --> 20:40.697
No. I'm not saying
that I did, either.

20:40.781 --> 20:41.990
It's just that, you know...

20:42.074 --> 20:44.117
My mom, she used
to always say that.

20:44.201 --> 20:46.161
{\an1}You know,
Felice was always

20:46.244 --> 20:48.830
the beautiful sister married
to the successful doctor.

20:48.914 --> 20:51.124
{\an1}And everything she had,
my mom wanted.

20:51.208 --> 20:53.794
It was stupid. I told her that,
but she was just...

20:53.877 --> 20:56.004
bitter, I guess.

21:00.259 --> 21:02.469
{\an1}Your credit card
was rejected.

21:02.552 --> 21:04.888
{\an3}Nuh-uh.
(chuckling)

21:06.139 --> 21:09.851
{\an3}Oh, my God. I don't
believe this.

21:09.935 --> 21:12.020
{\an1}Look, it's okay.
It's on the house, all right?

21:12.104 --> 21:15.190
{\an3}Thanks.

21:15.273 --> 21:17.359
{\an3}It's so stupid.
I guess when I quit,

21:17.442 --> 21:19.027
{\an3}they must have canceled
my expense account.

21:20.445 --> 21:22.030
I'll just go call
and clear it up.

21:22.114 --> 21:23.865
Is there a phone?

21:23.949 --> 21:25.242
Okay, great.

21:30.831 --> 21:32.165
So, have you heard anything?

21:32.249 --> 21:35.085
Cops did a paint sample today.

21:35.168 --> 21:38.171
Somebody heard they found
red scrapes on the kid's bike.

21:38.255 --> 21:39.214
Same as mine.

21:48.598 --> 21:50.559
You're out late.

21:50.642 --> 21:51.852
(laughing)

21:51.935 --> 21:53.437
Well, I'm not the one
with the curfew, Denise.

21:53.520 --> 21:55.480
You know, it's funny.

21:55.564 --> 21:58.108
I didn't recognize your voice.

21:58.191 --> 22:01.028
I guess I should pay a little
more attention to my call-ins.

22:02.821 --> 22:05.032
Your pager's inside.
I'll get it, and you can go.

22:05.115 --> 22:08.618
{\an1}I'm sorry.

22:08.702 --> 22:10.912
I wanted to tell you
how old I was.

22:10.996 --> 22:13.623
It just didn't come up.

22:13.707 --> 22:15.417
You don't look 17.

22:15.500 --> 22:17.711
Well, if you had to put up
with my parents,

22:17.794 --> 22:19.087
{\an3}you'd grow up fast, too.
Really?

22:19.171 --> 22:21.256
That's original.
You should keep using that one.

22:21.339 --> 22:24.551
David, we're in big trouble.

22:24.634 --> 22:25.510
(sighs)

22:25.594 --> 22:28.013
{\an4}I got into this
huge fight with
my parents.

22:28.096 --> 22:30.057
We started screaming,
and everything came out.

22:30.140 --> 22:32.059
They know about us.

22:32.142 --> 22:33.977
Denise, there is no "us."

22:34.061 --> 22:35.437
I pushed them too far this time.

22:35.520 --> 22:37.064
They told me

22:37.147 --> 22:39.441
they're not gonna let this
blow over.

22:39.524 --> 22:40.484
So what does that mean?

22:40.567 --> 22:43.111
They want to report you
to the police.

22:58.251 --> 22:59.878
Are you family?

22:59.961 --> 23:02.005
Yeah, he's my brother.

23:02.089 --> 23:04.591
{\an3}He hasn't regained
consciousness.

23:06.426 --> 23:08.178
{\an1}Thank you.

23:34.413 --> 23:35.831
Did I tell you
I ran into Val

23:35.914 --> 23:36.832
{\an3}yesterday at
the store?

23:36.915 --> 23:37.833
{\an1}Hopefully,
with your cart.

23:37.916 --> 23:39.167
{\an3}How come you
didn't tell me

23:39.251 --> 23:41.169
she was planning on
making dinner, too?

23:41.253 --> 23:43.171
It didn't come up.

23:43.255 --> 23:45.298
Well, she's pretty hurt.

23:45.382 --> 23:47.134
Everyone's abandoning her,

23:47.217 --> 23:49.219
{\an3}and you seem to be
the ringleader.

23:49.302 --> 23:51.680
Poor Valerie,
always the victim, right?

23:51.763 --> 23:54.349
{\an3}Well, kicking her around
isn't' gonna help anything.

23:54.432 --> 23:55.809
Don't defend her.

23:55.892 --> 23:59.980
I'm not. I just...
You don't understand.

24:00.063 --> 24:02.816
That she's completely damaged
and inhuman?

24:02.899 --> 24:04.025
Yes, I understand, David.

24:04.109 --> 24:06.027
But you don't understand why.

24:06.111 --> 24:08.780
And I don't want to.

24:11.867 --> 24:13.201
Her father molested her,

24:13.285 --> 24:16.163
and didn't stop
until she shot him.

24:16.246 --> 24:18.081
{\an3}She killed
her father.

24:19.791 --> 24:20.709
I didn't know.

24:20.792 --> 24:22.252
No one did.

24:22.335 --> 24:23.879
{\an3}I think that's
part of the problem.

24:23.962 --> 24:27.048
I gotta go.

24:37.309 --> 24:40.562
Hey, wait, wait, wait.

24:40.645 --> 24:43.231
Make it quick. I need coffee.

24:43.315 --> 24:44.399
{\an3}About this

24:44.482 --> 24:47.569
"bed buddies" thing...

24:47.652 --> 24:50.363
{\an3}I think we need to make
some adjustments.

24:50.447 --> 24:53.074
Well, if it ain't broke,
don't fix it.

24:53.158 --> 24:55.577
Not fix, just, um,

24:55.660 --> 24:58.079
fine-tune it
a little bit.

24:58.163 --> 25:00.248
{\an3}We see each other
every day,

25:00.332 --> 25:02.751
{\an3}and now pretty much
every night, too.

25:02.834 --> 25:05.253
I know we said

25:05.337 --> 25:07.923
we'd keep emotions
out of this, but...

25:08.006 --> 25:09.925
I'm seeing Andy
again tonight.

25:10.008 --> 25:11.218
Oh.

25:11.301 --> 25:13.553
We're going to a 7:00 movie,

25:13.637 --> 25:16.139
{\an1}and then we're gonna have
dinner, and then

25:16.223 --> 25:18.099
{\an1}I should be home,
like, around 11:00.

25:18.183 --> 25:20.268
I can't believe you're
so casual about this.

25:20.352 --> 25:22.437
Is there a reason
for me not to be?

25:22.520 --> 25:24.272
{\an3}Reason?

25:24.356 --> 25:28.068
Yeah, like, I'm spending too
much money going out every night

25:28.151 --> 25:31.655
{\an1}or it's affecting my work
or you're jealous.

25:31.738 --> 25:34.449
{\an3}Jealous?
I'm not jealous.

25:34.532 --> 25:36.284
{\an3}Why would you say
I'm jealous?

25:36.368 --> 25:37.285
I'm not jealous.

25:37.369 --> 25:38.787
{\an1}I didn't say
you were jealous.

25:38.870 --> 25:40.288
{\an3}Good, 'cause
I'm not.

25:40.372 --> 25:42.249
Well, then we're clear.

25:42.332 --> 25:44.417
No emotions.

25:51.341 --> 25:54.803
No emotions. (sighs)

26:02.227 --> 26:03.311
Can I help you?

26:03.395 --> 26:05.230
Mrs. O'Lare,
I'm David Silver.

26:05.313 --> 26:07.190
{\an3}I figured we should talk
before things got...

26:07.274 --> 26:08.149
How dare you?

26:08.233 --> 26:11.278
{\an1}How dare you come
to our home?

26:11.361 --> 26:13.613
Denise told me you're upset.
That's why I'm here.

26:13.697 --> 26:15.115
Figured we could talk
face-to-face

26:15.198 --> 26:17.325
and straighten this out.
We have a misunderstanding.

26:17.409 --> 26:21.162
No, Mr. Silver, what we have
is a felony.

26:21.246 --> 26:23.164
It's called "statutory rape."

26:23.248 --> 26:24.541
If you'll just let me explain...

26:24.624 --> 26:26.334
You can explain it to a judge.

26:26.418 --> 26:27.627
Can we just talk?

26:27.711 --> 26:30.005
Get out of here
or I'm calling the police.

26:33.258 --> 26:35.635
Okay.

26:35.719 --> 26:37.637
(knocking)

26:39.639 --> 26:41.558
I'm here to help
with Thanksgiving.

26:46.271 --> 26:47.981
Oh, damn it!

26:48.064 --> 26:49.316
{\an1}I'm trying here,
Valerie.

26:49.399 --> 26:53.903
{\an3}Yeah? And why the sudden
change of heart, huh?

26:53.987 --> 26:55.697
Well, I talked to David,

26:55.780 --> 26:57.490
and he told me everything
about your father.

26:57.574 --> 27:00.076
So you stocked up on pity
and decide to bring some over?

27:00.160 --> 27:01.286
Look for another

27:01.369 --> 27:02.746
charity case.
It's not gonna be me.

27:02.829 --> 27:04.831
This is not about pity, Valerie.

27:04.914 --> 27:06.041
Whatever it is, I don't need it.

27:06.124 --> 27:07.042
And I certainly don't need you.

27:07.125 --> 27:08.335
What you do need is a friend,

27:08.418 --> 27:09.961
and I'm really trying
to be one here.

27:10.045 --> 27:11.338
(sighs)

27:13.465 --> 27:14.924
Good-bye.

27:15.008 --> 27:17.302
I'm not leaving until you agree
to let me help with dinner.

27:20.472 --> 27:21.639
What are you doing?

27:24.517 --> 27:26.394
What dinner?

27:27.645 --> 27:28.563
Just go.

27:28.646 --> 27:30.273
Fine.

27:30.357 --> 27:33.943
Don't trip over the bird
on your way out.

27:46.331 --> 27:47.957
{\an3}Hey, hey, no!
What are you doing?

27:48.041 --> 27:50.543
(hoarsely):
Seven, eight, nine.

27:50.627 --> 27:53.046
You said that you stopped.

27:53.129 --> 27:57.217
That kid that I hit,
he was only 16.

27:58.510 --> 27:59.761
His name was Mark.

27:59.844 --> 28:01.763
"Was"?

28:01.846 --> 28:04.057
He didn't make it.

28:04.140 --> 28:06.393
I can't even look at you.

28:10.897 --> 28:12.315
I'll go, okay?

28:18.613 --> 28:20.281
Hey.
Hey.

28:20.365 --> 28:22.409
Off the wagon already?

28:22.492 --> 28:25.161
I can't even stay here.

28:25.245 --> 28:26.913
Is that horrible?

28:26.996 --> 28:28.790
No, not at all.

28:28.873 --> 28:31.126
I'm just so scared that he's
gonna do something crazy.

28:31.209 --> 28:34.087
You know what?
He's acting like a baby.

28:34.170 --> 28:35.672
He needs a sitter.

28:35.755 --> 28:37.340
Lucky for you,
I'm very experienced.

28:37.424 --> 28:38.633
Thanks, Gina.

28:38.716 --> 28:40.343
You're welcome.

28:54.774 --> 28:56.860
Kamikaze shot.

28:56.943 --> 28:59.821
{\an1}Unless you plan
on dancing on the bar,

28:59.904 --> 29:03.199
you better sip that.

29:03.283 --> 29:05.452
Okay, thanks
for the tip.

29:05.535 --> 29:07.245
No problem.

29:15.044 --> 29:16.129
Hey!

29:16.212 --> 29:17.505
Hey!

29:17.589 --> 29:18.506
{\an3}What happened
to Andy?

29:18.590 --> 29:21.176
Oh, uh, he had this, uh,

29:21.259 --> 29:23.636
{\an1}last-minute late-night
thing that he had to do...

29:23.720 --> 29:25.013
{\an3}Uh-huh.
I like <i> Dave.</i>

29:25.096 --> 29:26.181
so he rescheduled.

29:26.264 --> 29:27.515
{\an3}When he pretends
that he's the president

29:27.599 --> 29:28.558
{\an5}and actually
rebalances
the budget.

29:28.641 --> 29:29.851
{\an1}I didn't cancel
the date.

29:29.934 --> 29:30.685
It was just
scheduling.

29:30.768 --> 29:32.479
{\an1}Or when the Secret Service
guy tells him

29:32.562 --> 29:33.980
{\an1}that he'll take
a bullet for him?

29:34.063 --> 29:35.982
{\an3}He didn't blow me off.
It was a rain check.

29:36.065 --> 29:37.150
I love that movie.
What? What?

29:37.233 --> 29:39.152
<i>Dave--</i>
the movie you're renting.

29:39.235 --> 29:43.198
Oh, well,
it's the last copy, so...

29:43.281 --> 29:44.699
What do you say
we watch it together?

29:44.782 --> 29:46.826
No, we can't.

29:46.910 --> 29:49.204
Why not? It's pretty obvious
you're up for some romance.

29:49.287 --> 29:50.413
Yeah, with someone else.

29:50.497 --> 29:51.664
Ouch.

29:51.748 --> 29:52.832
Steve, I am...

29:52.916 --> 29:55.710
No, no. (chuckles) It's okay.

29:55.793 --> 29:56.544
It's funny, though.

29:56.628 --> 29:58.838
You were the one
who said you wanted

29:58.922 --> 30:00.215
to keep our relationship
emotion-free.

30:00.298 --> 30:02.550
Yeah, I-I did. I am.

30:02.634 --> 30:03.885
Why do you hate me so much?

30:19.359 --> 30:20.735
{\an3}You're trying
to forget,

30:20.818 --> 30:23.363
{\an3}and you almost forget what
you're trying to forget.

30:23.446 --> 30:24.113
It's okay, huh?

30:24.197 --> 30:26.366
{\an1}Uh, yeah.
(chuckles)

30:26.449 --> 30:29.369
{\an1}Oh, watch it there,
cowboy.

30:29.452 --> 30:31.454
Where'd you say
Donna was again?

30:31.538 --> 30:34.040
She's home.

30:34.123 --> 30:35.250
She's okay, right?

30:35.333 --> 30:36.960
Yeah, she's perfect.

30:37.043 --> 30:39.128
Wait, wait, wait.

30:39.212 --> 30:41.297
{\an1}Good man.

30:41.381 --> 30:42.382
What?

30:42.465 --> 30:43.758
Come on. Come on.

30:43.841 --> 30:47.554
{\an4}MAN:
Whoa, we got
a winner here.

30:47.637 --> 30:50.431
(both chuckle)

30:50.515 --> 30:51.599
(sighs) What's next?

30:51.683 --> 30:52.725
What are you...?

30:52.809 --> 30:53.768
I don't know.

30:53.851 --> 30:55.770
{\an1}The thing has
to warm up or something.

30:55.853 --> 30:56.980
So what's your secret?

30:57.063 --> 30:58.273
I don't have one.

30:58.356 --> 30:59.774
{\an3}No, no,
you were dancing

30:59.857 --> 31:02.443
like someone who wants
to forget. I know.

31:02.527 --> 31:04.404
Forget what?
I don't know.

31:04.487 --> 31:06.239
You tell me, Kamikaze.

31:23.381 --> 31:24.340
Hey.

31:24.424 --> 31:26.050
Hi.

31:26.134 --> 31:27.468
Cappuccino, please.

31:27.552 --> 31:29.262
{\an3}Long day?

31:29.345 --> 31:31.180
{\an1}Well, I've been defending
this woman

31:31.264 --> 31:34.267
who shoplifted a pair
of shoes for her kid.

31:34.350 --> 31:36.477
{\an1}They want to lock her up
for six months.

31:36.561 --> 31:38.313
That doesn't seem fair.

31:38.396 --> 31:39.772
Well, I mean, we won,

31:39.856 --> 31:43.318
{\an1}but at first
I wasn't so sure.

31:43.401 --> 31:47.196
{\an1}That ever happen
to you?

31:47.280 --> 31:49.490
My relationship with Brandon,
my career.

31:49.574 --> 31:50.867
I thought you were a jerk.

31:50.950 --> 31:51.993
Really?

31:52.076 --> 31:54.162
And then you saw
how I danced, of course.

31:54.245 --> 31:56.831
It was something like this.
The hips, right?

31:56.914 --> 31:58.166
(both laugh)

31:58.249 --> 31:59.667
Hey, David, hi.
Hey, hey.

31:59.751 --> 32:01.002
I was just...
Dancing, yeah.

32:01.085 --> 32:02.170
Well...
Good.

32:02.253 --> 32:03.755
{\an5}Yeah, I gotta
get going.
Hi, Kel.

32:03.838 --> 32:04.881
Hi.

32:04.964 --> 32:07.425
Can I talk to you
just for a minute?

32:07.508 --> 32:08.968
Oh, should I leave?

32:09.052 --> 32:09.886
{\an1}It's fine.

32:09.969 --> 32:12.388
{\an1}I met this girl
at the club,

32:12.472 --> 32:15.016
and she came by my house
afterwards.

32:15.099 --> 32:17.518
And I found out
the next morning she's 17.

32:17.602 --> 32:19.395
{\an1}Her parents
are freaking out.

32:19.479 --> 32:22.231
{\an5}Please tell me
I have nothing
to worry about.

32:22.315 --> 32:25.193
Well, if her parents are getting
involved,

32:25.276 --> 32:26.527
they may be thinking
statutory rape.

32:26.611 --> 32:28.529
{\an1}Yeah, but it was
completely consensual.

32:28.613 --> 32:31.699
But if she's a minor,
that doesn't matter.

32:31.783 --> 32:33.576
Wait a minute.

32:33.660 --> 32:35.578
David, you said you met
her at The After Dark,

32:35.662 --> 32:37.372
then she must have been
lying about her age.

32:37.455 --> 32:39.332
Kelly's right.
That might help your case.

32:39.415 --> 32:40.333
This is unreal.

32:40.416 --> 32:41.751
I mean, she came on to <i> me.</i>

32:41.834 --> 32:44.003
And I'm sure she did,
but unfortunately,

32:44.087 --> 32:45.296
{\an3}the law doesn't take
that into account.

32:45.380 --> 32:48.049
{\an3}Now, David, depending
on her credibility,

32:48.132 --> 32:50.051
{\an3}you can be looking
at jail time.

32:57.308 --> 33:00.144
NOAH:
<i>Adam Stein.</i>

33:00.228 --> 33:04.065
{\an1}(laughing):
Adam Stanley, I said.

33:04.148 --> 33:05.441
The wrong guy.

33:05.525 --> 33:07.068
Yes, the wrong guy.

33:07.151 --> 33:12.365
{\an1}The one I fell for
in the eighth grade.

33:12.448 --> 33:13.783
(groaning)

33:13.866 --> 33:16.577
If it's the wrong guy,
why did you fall for him?

33:16.661 --> 33:18.955
'Cause Donna did first.

33:19.038 --> 33:20.873
(chuckles)

33:20.957 --> 33:24.293
But sooner or later,
he fell for me.

34:00.288 --> 34:02.248
{\an3}Noah.

34:02.331 --> 34:04.375
{\an3}Noah. Hey.
Wake up.

34:06.377 --> 34:07.462
{\an3}Hey.

34:07.545 --> 34:08.963
I wanted to be the
first to tell you.

34:09.047 --> 34:10.214
{\an3}They caught the hit
and run driver.

34:10.297 --> 34:13.926
It was some woman in Pasadena.
It was on the news this morning.

34:14.010 --> 34:15.469
Are you sure?

34:15.553 --> 34:16.679
Yeah, I'm positive.

34:16.763 --> 34:18.264
You didn't do it.

34:18.347 --> 34:21.225
{\an1}Thank you.

34:22.310 --> 34:23.226
{\an3}Mmm?

34:24.395 --> 34:25.353
Hey, what are those?

34:25.438 --> 34:28.649
{\an1}Oh, these are just some
goofy pictures that we took.

34:28.733 --> 34:30.485
Yeah? Let me see.

34:30.568 --> 34:31.402
Oh, I'm sorry. I'll...

34:31.485 --> 34:33.154
{\an1}I should probably
show them to you later.

34:33.237 --> 34:35.322
{\an1}You guys probably
want to talk, right?

34:35.406 --> 34:36.324
Okay.

34:40.745 --> 34:42.496
{\an1}Look, I don't know
what to say.

34:42.580 --> 34:45.166
Say it's over.

34:45.248 --> 34:47.543
It is. I promise.

35:00.097 --> 35:01.682
"Calamine: A Love Story."

35:01.766 --> 35:03.059
It's very catchy,
don't you think?

35:03.142 --> 35:04.352
I think you could have waited

35:04.435 --> 35:06.062
till after Thanksgiving
to show me this.

35:06.145 --> 35:09.023
Well, no. I needed your opinion
'cause you said you wanted

35:09.106 --> 35:10.191
{\an1}to accentuate
our look, so...

35:10.274 --> 35:12.693
how much red should the
photo people add to her hives?

35:12.777 --> 35:15.530
I'll think about it over the
holiday and get back to you.

35:15.613 --> 35:16.864
Here.

35:16.948 --> 35:18.533
What's that?

35:18.616 --> 35:21.410
It's <i> Dave.</i> It doesn't have
to be returned till Monday.

35:21.494 --> 35:24.038
{\an3}I still don't know why we
couldn't watch it together.

35:24.121 --> 35:26.207
{\an1}Because...

35:26.290 --> 35:28.334
{\an1}if we acted like a couple,
we'd be a couple.

35:28.417 --> 35:29.544
{\an3}That's bad?

35:29.627 --> 35:32.046
Yeah. It's awful.

35:32.129 --> 35:33.047
Why?

35:33.130 --> 35:36.217
{\an1}Because one of us
would get hurt.

35:36.300 --> 35:38.052
Probably me.

35:49.313 --> 35:50.439
I'll get the plates.

35:50.523 --> 35:51.566
I'll get the glasses.

35:51.649 --> 35:52.733
Happy Thanksgiving.

35:52.817 --> 35:53.776
{\an1}Incoming.

35:53.860 --> 35:55.069
{\an3}Where to?
Living room.

35:55.152 --> 35:57.154
Let's see. Uh...

36:01.117 --> 36:05.705
{\an1}I could say I'm sorry
for the way I've treated you.

36:05.788 --> 36:07.582
But I wouldn't believe you.

36:07.665 --> 36:10.084
And you could apologize for all
the crap you've put me through.

36:10.167 --> 36:12.336
And you'd have every
right to be skeptical.

36:14.130 --> 36:16.090
So, I guess we're even?

36:16.173 --> 36:17.550
Yeah.

36:17.633 --> 36:18.926
Let's try and keep it that way.

36:20.052 --> 36:21.304
What did you tell them?

36:21.387 --> 36:22.263
{\an1}Nothing.

36:22.346 --> 36:24.348
Just that this was
the place to celebrate.

36:25.808 --> 36:27.226
Oh, uh...

36:27.310 --> 36:28.603
There's no more pie left.

36:28.686 --> 36:30.229
I kind of ate it.

36:30.313 --> 36:32.940
So, are we supposed to
shake hands or something?

36:33.024 --> 36:35.651
Something. Come here.

36:40.865 --> 36:43.576
Oh, listen. Um, help me pack up
these boxes in my car later.

36:43.659 --> 36:44.869
{\an1}I'll mail them
to Brandon on Monday.

36:44.952 --> 36:48.289
{\an3}Actually, they're
not Brandon's.

36:54.587 --> 36:56.172
So, I hear you might be
staying in town for a while.

36:56.255 --> 36:57.423
{\an1}Uh, yeah.

36:57.506 --> 36:58.758
I'm weighing
my options.

36:58.841 --> 36:59.800
{\an1}I think there might be
a lot for me here.

36:59.884 --> 37:01.177
{\an3}Cool.

37:01.260 --> 37:03.179
Just please tell me I'm
not going to go to jail

37:03.262 --> 37:04.430
over this stupid thing.

37:04.513 --> 37:06.140
You're not.

37:06.223 --> 37:07.683
{\an1}I'm not. See,
I don't believe that.

37:10.228 --> 37:13.314
Paranoid, freaking out.

37:13.397 --> 37:14.482
(sighs)

37:14.565 --> 37:15.483
{\an3}Hey.

37:15.566 --> 37:17.985
I was driving around and
I saw a smashed Dumpster

37:18.069 --> 37:19.111
a few blocks from the club.

37:19.195 --> 37:20.446
I think that's what I hit.

37:20.529 --> 37:21.530
You're very lucky.

37:23.574 --> 37:25.660
Okeydoke. Dinner is served.

37:25.743 --> 37:27.870
{\an1}Oh, cheers.
Hey.

37:27.954 --> 37:31.040
(clearing throat)

37:31.123 --> 37:32.166
Is this anyone's?

37:32.250 --> 37:34.043
{\an3}No. I'm gonna start
with this one.

37:34.126 --> 37:36.712
Um, listen up. I-I have
an announcement to make.

37:41.050 --> 37:44.136
I've been doing a lot
of thinking this last week

37:44.220 --> 37:46.764
about my life
and where I want it to go.

37:46.847 --> 37:50.559
And I've made a decision.

37:50.643 --> 37:53.020
I'm leaving.

37:55.648 --> 37:57.858
My mom asked me
to move back home.

37:57.942 --> 38:00.111
I accepted
and my plane leaves tonight.

38:01.278 --> 38:03.030
This may shock you,

38:03.114 --> 38:05.491
but I've always wanted
to be a part of this group.

38:07.076 --> 38:08.202
I know sometimes that...

38:08.286 --> 38:10.746
my methods were a little off.

38:10.830 --> 38:14.375
And I know
sometimes I hurt people.

38:14.458 --> 38:17.169
But I'm thankful that I have
friends who know how to forgive.

38:21.340 --> 38:22.925
So, happy Thanksgiving.

38:23.009 --> 38:24.719
Cheers.

38:24.802 --> 38:26.554
And, um, no sappy good-byes

38:26.637 --> 38:27.930
'cause I really can't
stand them.

38:28.931 --> 38:31.100
Cheers.
Cheers.

38:31.183 --> 38:33.227
ALL:
Cheers.

38:38.816 --> 38:40.568
{\an3}You know, I would
have taken you.

38:40.651 --> 38:42.403
No, it's okay.

38:42.486 --> 38:44.030
Holiday traffic and stuff.

38:44.113 --> 38:45.740
{\an1}Thanks.

38:53.497 --> 38:55.041
Call when you get there.

38:55.124 --> 38:57.084
Yeah.

38:57.168 --> 38:59.170
{\an3}Thanks.
Thank you.

39:03.174 --> 39:04.258
{\an3}(sighs)

39:04.341 --> 39:06.177
What's wrong?

39:06.260 --> 39:09.346
I'm going to miss you.

39:12.099 --> 39:14.727
I'm going to miss you, too.

39:14.810 --> 39:17.104
(car door opening and closing)

39:17.188 --> 39:19.440
(sniffling)

39:19.523 --> 39:21.567
{\an1}Uh, why don't you
come with me?

39:21.650 --> 39:22.777
{\an3}(laughing)

39:22.860 --> 39:24.987
{\an3}I can't. I can't
just pick up and go.

39:25.071 --> 39:27.198
Yeah, I know.

39:31.160 --> 39:33.120
Well, um...

39:35.414 --> 39:36.791
Here goes.

39:36.874 --> 39:39.085
{\an3}Mm-hmm.

39:39.168 --> 39:42.296
{\an1}Time to look to the future
and never look back.

39:44.048 --> 39:46.967
Never, ever look back.

39:56.185 --> 39:57.103
Bye.

39:57.186 --> 39:59.355
Bye.

40:08.739 --> 40:10.783
(engine starting)

40:23.504 --> 40:26.340
{\an1}Okay, so I'm thinking.
You. Matt. Potential. Hello?

40:26.423 --> 40:28.551
Oh, possibly.

40:28.634 --> 40:31.387
Hey, Donna. I need to call
my mom. Can I use Noah's room?

40:31.470 --> 40:32.972
Oh, yeah, sure.

40:33.055 --> 40:34.682
Hey, I want to see
those pictures you guys took.

40:34.765 --> 40:37.017
Oh, yeah. I wanted
to show them to you

40:37.101 --> 40:38.144
and now
I can't find them anywhere.

40:38.227 --> 40:40.980
{\an1}Hmm.

40:41.063 --> 40:42.106
She seems nice.

40:42.189 --> 40:45.025
Yeah? You know, I was thinking,
if she decides to stay,

40:45.109 --> 40:46.277
maybe she could take
the third bedroom,

40:46.360 --> 40:47.903
{\an1}if that's okay.
Yeah.

40:47.987 --> 40:49.321
{\an3}Yeah, that'd be great.
She'll fit right in.

40:49.405 --> 40:51.532
Cool.

40:51.615 --> 40:54.285
Yeah, it's pretty unbelievable.

40:54.368 --> 40:56.829
{\an5}WOMAN:
Life on that side
of the tracks always is.

40:56.912 --> 40:59.206
Are you ready for this?
Donna owns her own boutique.

40:59.290 --> 41:01.667
And how is
my dear sister Felice?

41:01.750 --> 41:03.210
Seen the rich bitch yet?

41:03.294 --> 41:06.881
No, Mom, but I've decided
to stay for a while.

41:11.802 --> 41:13.721
Here you go.
Thanks.

41:13.804 --> 41:16.515
{\an3}And, um...

41:16.599 --> 41:17.725
I had a really
great time tonight.

41:17.808 --> 41:19.560
Good. I'm glad. So did I.

41:19.643 --> 41:21.061
Consider it the first of many.

41:21.145 --> 41:23.230
I will.

41:48.756 --> 41:50.341
{\an1}(chuckles)

41:50.424 --> 41:51.926
{\an3}Yeah...

41:55.179 --> 41:57.223
To the curb.

42:00.184 --> 42:01.852
"To the curb..."

42:03.604 --> 42:04.730
{\an3}(sighs)

42:04.813 --> 42:05.773
Dylan!

42:05.856 --> 42:07.441
Hey, man!
Hey, buddy.

42:07.524 --> 42:08.609
{\an1}Right on!

42:08.692 --> 42:11.070
Come on in.
Oh, it's good to see you!

42:11.153 --> 42:12.112
How you doing, brother?

42:12.196 --> 42:13.155
What are you doing here, man?

42:13.239 --> 42:14.281
Oh, my God!

42:14.365 --> 42:15.699
You on vacation or something?

42:15.783 --> 42:16.992
{\an3}I guess I lost my
invite in the mail, huh?

42:17.076 --> 42:18.118
How long you back for?

42:18.202 --> 42:20.079
{\an5}I don't know.
You know, you
just missed Valerie.

42:20.162 --> 42:21.121
How's Brenda?

42:21.205 --> 42:22.539
{\an3}Why don't you call
her and ask her?

42:22.623 --> 42:25.125
Sorry. We're just excited
to see you.

42:25.209 --> 42:26.835
It's okay. It's good to be seen.

42:26.919 --> 42:28.128
Aw.

42:28.212 --> 42:29.255
What's going on?

42:29.338 --> 42:33.175
Happy Thanksgiving, Kel.

42:37.221 --> 42:37.972
So, when did you get in?

42:38.055 --> 42:40.140
I cleared customs
about an hour ago.

42:40.224 --> 42:41.475
You don't look happy to see me.

42:41.558 --> 42:44.144
I'm just, um... shocked.

42:45.354 --> 42:46.814
How long are you staying?

42:46.897 --> 42:48.023
I don't know.

42:48.107 --> 42:49.650
But I'm still waiting
for my hug.

42:49.733 --> 42:51.485
{\an3}Sorry.

42:51.568 --> 42:53.988
Hey.

42:54.071 --> 42:55.322
{\an3}(chuckles)

42:57.574 --> 42:59.493
{\an3}I've been saving this
for a special occasion.

42:59.576 --> 43:01.996
{\an1}Oh, and there is no
more special an occasion

43:02.079 --> 43:03.247
than this very occasion.

43:03.330 --> 43:04.665
Close your eyes. Whoo!

43:04.748 --> 43:06.166
DAVID:
That was beautiful.

43:06.250 --> 43:07.668
Cups?
Oh...

43:07.751 --> 43:09.003
Who's that guy?

43:09.086 --> 43:11.005
DAVID:
Cups? Cups? Huh?

43:11.088 --> 43:12.464
He's, um, an old friend.

43:12.548 --> 43:13.674
{\an1}Hmm.

43:18.220 --> 43:19.346
To Dylan.

43:19.430 --> 43:21.223
Back amongst the living.

43:21.307 --> 43:23.142
{\an1}For the moment.
Cheers.

43:23.225 --> 43:24.643
ALL:
Cheers.

43:24.727 --> 43:26.645
{\an3}Cheers.
