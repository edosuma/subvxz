- I think so.

00:09.843 --> 00:12.813
- I wanted a family, so that's
what the house made for me.

00:12.846 --> 00:15.783

- Jules, he's in the house.

- You're not supposed
to be here!

00:22.490 --> 00:23.824
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- You followed us out?

00:23.857 --> 00:25.193
- Don't you want
to find some way

00:25.226 --> 00:27.161
where we can still be a family?

00:27.195 --> 00:28.296
- Well, there's a guaranteed way
to get him

00:28.329 --> 00:29.397
back inside the House.

00:29.430 --> 00:30.764
It's if you go with him.

00:30.798 --> 00:32.833
- I'm not stepping foot
back in that place.

Don't go!

[crackling]

01:24.652 --> 01:27.188
- You're starving.

01:27.221 --> 01:29.390
- I can wait another day.

01:34.328 --> 01:36.364
- It's been long enough.

01:41.869 --> 01:43.704
It's okay.
I wrote it down.

01:52.613 --> 01:55.283
There was this lake that we
would go to in the summer.

01:55.316 --> 01:57.785
[distorted voices]

01:57.818 --> 02:02.256
And when the light
started to go away,

02:02.290 --> 02:06.794
we would walk
out into this big field,

02:06.827 --> 02:10.264
and we would look for UFOs.

02:10.298 --> 02:13.434
[distorted voices]

02:15.636 --> 02:18.839
And you would say,

"It's getting dark.

02:20.741 --> 02:22.676
It's time to go home."

[distorted voices]

02:25.413 --> 02:29.417
You picked up an apple
and said,

"Remember: if ever an apple
just like this

"don't take a bite.

02:39.727 --> 02:42.663
The fish might be fishing
for us."

03:07.688 --> 03:10.258
What was that?

- A few afternoons.

on a lot of walks lately.

06:25.553 --> 06:28.922
- Yeah. I was just trying
to clear my head.

06:28.956 --> 06:31.759
- You know they're suffering.
It's not fair.

06:31.792 --> 06:33.894
- Well, I don't have anything
left to feed them.

06:36.163 --> 06:38.899
I already gave them everything
I don't want to remember.

to get you alone, doesn't it?

- Yeah. I figured it might've
starved to death by now.

They don't starve to death.

still out there.

- Whatever it is,

11:05.432 --> 11:09.369
it hasn't eaten in so long
that if it does get you...

11:09.402 --> 11:11.772
it's gonna take everything.

11:14.107 --> 11:17.811
So, just--

11:17.845 --> 11:21.048
just keep your eyes open,

'cause everything got
changed around.

It's only a couple blocks away.

It's a little close
for comfort--believe me--

11:55.215 --> 11:58.151

not really my call.

12:07.294 --> 12:10.130
- What?

12:10.163 --> 12:14.968
- What you don't understand is
that this house is an organism.

12:17.537 --> 12:20.874
It has instincts.

12:20.908 --> 12:23.476
It has an appetite.

12:23.510 --> 12:26.379
It has a will to survive.

12:29.349 --> 12:32.452
And the more I understand it,

12:32.485 --> 12:36.023
the more I admire it.

12:36.056 --> 12:38.258
I wish you would, too.

12:40.227 --> 12:42.395
- What is that?
A sales pitch?

12:42.429 --> 12:45.032
You sound psychotic, okay?

12:45.065 --> 12:46.299
And I'm not buying

12:46.333 --> 12:48.802
whatever it is
that you're selling.

12:48.836 --> 12:50.303
I came here to get Margot out,

what I am going to do,

12:52.205 --> 12:55.909

and fuck the House!

Everything's different now.

14:10.417 --> 14:12.352

about something.

14:20.360 --> 14:23.496
- Yeah?

14:23.530 --> 14:25.465
- We should close the door.

- What do you mean?

14:35.042 --> 14:37.144
- Well, to the House.

Popped up somewhere new
out there to lure people in,

14:40.613 --> 14:46.153
and--lock the door, or bar it,
or set the house on fire.

it's evolved into it,
so I just--

14:50.390 --> 14:53.293
I--I don't know
if it's gonna be that easy.

14:53.326 --> 14:55.562
- But what if it is?
We should at least try

14:55.595 --> 14:56.997

a couple times already.

- I just don't think it's
a good idea to do anything

22:02.889 --> 22:06.393
here that, you know,
could upset the ecosystem.

22:06.426 --> 22:09.028
You know what I mean?

22:09.061 --> 22:11.364
- No, not really.

22:11.398 --> 22:14.801
- I'm worried that she's gonna
try and do something stupid

22:14.834 --> 22:18.505
like burn the house down
or something.

22:18.538 --> 22:21.140
I--I--and, you know,
that doesn't work.

22:21.173 --> 22:23.009
I've seen people try it.

22:23.042 --> 22:25.412
- Keeping other people
from getting trapped in here

22:25.445 --> 22:27.146
sounds like a pretty good idea
to me.

22:27.179 --> 22:29.849
- Well, no, it's not.

22:29.882 --> 22:32.018
I mean,
if the House doesn't eat,

22:32.051 --> 22:34.120
then--I don't know.

22:34.153 --> 22:35.622
It might die.

22:35.655 --> 22:37.524
And you--you're a part
of the House,

22:37.557 --> 22:40.960
so I'm just trying to look out
for you.

22:40.993 --> 22:43.129
- I'm gonna die anyway.

22:43.162 --> 22:44.664
Margot's gonna get hollowed out,

22:44.697 --> 22:46.999
so she might as well be dead.

22:47.033 --> 22:49.836
As for you,

22:49.869 --> 22:53.005
well, we all have to make
sacrifices, now, don't we?

the last thing I'd ever forget.

23:50.229 --> 23:52.231
What happened?

23:52.264 --> 23:54.801
- I'm here to take you home.

23:57.737 --> 24:00.106
Margot?

24:00.139 --> 24:02.475
What?

24:03.543 --> 24:05.545
- Um, well, it's not that easy.

24:05.578 --> 24:07.747
- Yes, Margot.
Yes, it is.

24:07.780 --> 24:09.516
Come on. Let's go.

24:09.549 --> 24:10.783
And we got to go now.

24:10.817 --> 24:13.119
- No, Jules. I live here.

24:13.152 --> 24:15.121
I--I would have to--

24:15.154 --> 24:17.490
- What? Tell them? No.

24:17.524 --> 24:21.494
This is a prison break, Margot.

24:21.528 --> 24:24.597
- Look.
I don't remember out there.

24:24.631 --> 24:25.865
I mean, I know it exists,

24:25.898 --> 24:28.935
but it's just this big,
dark thing.

24:28.968 --> 24:32.071
I remember you, and I remember
the two people in this house.

24:33.640 --> 24:36.008
- Margot,
I have to show you something.

24:38.044 --> 24:39.812
- Okay. What?

24:42.314 --> 24:43.916
- Come on.

Come on.

you need to know about Seth.

26:10.069 --> 26:12.939
- She's another you.
Seth brought her here,

26:12.972 --> 26:16.208
and he let the House
hollow her out.

26:21.180 --> 26:22.782
- How long has she been
in the House?

26:22.815 --> 26:24.383
[pencil continues scratching]

26:24.416 --> 26:28.387
- She doesn't even know she's
in the No-End House anymore.

26:28.420 --> 26:30.723
- What are you guys
talking about?

26:33.693 --> 26:35.862
Is Seth coming back soon?

26:42.268 --> 26:47.273
- Pretty soon, you'll be
just as hollow as she is.

26:47.306 --> 26:49.141
And then he'll replace you, too.

26:52.311 --> 26:54.013
Hey.

27:04.757 --> 27:07.059
Margot, are you gonna
come home now?

27:07.093 --> 27:11.197
You're coming with me now,
right?

Right?

You're gonna wait here.

a little more helpful than that.

28:25.337 --> 28:27.139
- Who lives here?

28:30.877 --> 28:33.245
- You met her?

28:33.279 --> 28:36.082
- I met something
that used to be a person.

28:39.385 --> 28:42.989
- We came in
in the same group.

28:43.022 --> 28:45.391
She didn't last very long.
She was young.

28:45.424 --> 28:47.293
There's less memories to steal.

28:49.829 --> 28:51.263
I swear to God, Margot,

28:51.297 --> 28:54.000
I just come to check on her
sometimes.

28:57.436 --> 28:59.806
- So, you came in together.

28:59.839 --> 29:02.909
- Margot, look at you.
You're all worried.

29:05.945 --> 29:08.047
Your dad and I want you
to come home.

that if I'm out of the way,

31:39.331 --> 31:42.334
that it'll be easier for you
to get her to go with you.

31:54.113 --> 31:56.215
You're right.

31:58.484 --> 32:00.219
Do it.

32:07.026 --> 32:09.728

totally honest.

that went into that house

32:33.785 --> 32:36.022
and never came out.

- [scoffs]

you don't recognize

32:42.661 --> 32:46.232
how special this place is.

32:46.265 --> 32:49.701
- Yeah, maybe I keep forgetting.

32:49.735 --> 32:51.637
You know, honestly,
I feel like I'm seeing you

32:51.670 --> 32:53.772
for the first time, and you're
not who I thought you were.

32:53.805 --> 32:56.775
- No. Don't say that.

32:56.808 --> 32:59.111
I'm what I always told you
I was.

32:59.145 --> 33:02.314
I'm someone that has never
belonged anywhere

33:02.348 --> 33:04.383
until this place took me in,

33:04.416 --> 33:06.785
and it saved me.

33:06.818 --> 33:09.255
- It's one thing for you
to figure out how to live here,

33:09.288 --> 33:11.090
and it's another thing
for you to take other people

33:11.123 --> 33:13.559
and feed them to a house
every year.

33:13.592 --> 33:16.295
- A house?

33:16.328 --> 33:19.565
A house?

33:19.598 --> 33:23.035
God! I keep waiting

33:23.069 --> 33:26.038
for one of you to understand

33:26.072 --> 33:30.276
how magnificent this place is!

33:30.309 --> 33:33.312
All the gifts
that it can give you!

33:33.345 --> 33:38.517
Because memory is a disease!

33:40.252 --> 33:43.222
And then this house is the cure!

33:43.255 --> 33:46.258
How can you not see that?

33:48.860 --> 33:52.198
But if you don't want
to use it...

33:56.202 --> 33:59.171
Maybe you're not
who I thought you were.

34:01.173 --> 34:05.344
Maybe you are
just like everybody else.

34:08.214 --> 34:10.482
Disappointing.

34:12.784 --> 34:16.688

then what's love?

An infection?

34:22.661 --> 34:25.464
- I did love you.

34:25.497 --> 34:28.200
I still do love you.

34:31.170 --> 34:33.372
I just loved them first.

34:36.242 --> 34:37.876

turned them into husks

34:37.909 --> 34:39.411
and put them
back in their boxes.

Well, I'm not a serial killer.

34:46.318 --> 34:48.387
