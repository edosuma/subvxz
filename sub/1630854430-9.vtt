00:01.535 --> 00:03.571
VOICE: MTV...

00:07.075 --> 00:08.542
So you gonna tell me
what's going on?

00:08.676 --> 00:09.943
You coming back from New York,

00:10.078 --> 00:11.779
your hands all bruised.

00:11.912 --> 00:13.847
Your bar shot up.

00:13.981 --> 00:15.683
I mean, obviously
something went down.

00:15.816 --> 00:19.553
-Oh, I suck at this.
-Ah, practice makes perfect.

00:19.687 --> 00:21.489
Why are we practicing again?

00:21.622 --> 00:23.157
Are there people after us?

00:23.291 --> 00:25.126
Uncle Dwight, you and me,

00:25.259 --> 00:27.961
we gotta make amends.
I'm coming to visit.

00:28.096 --> 00:30.431
You know where to find me.

00:30.564 --> 00:31.865
Fuck that piece of shit.

00:31.999 --> 00:33.033
So, Dwight Manfredi,
as far as we know,

00:33.167 --> 00:34.435
he ain't just passing through.

00:34.568 --> 00:36.370
There's also some
other woman he's been

00:36.504 --> 00:38.406
-seen with, but we haven't--
-Okay, so basically

00:38.539 --> 00:40.374
what you're saying is
the FBI has nothing, right?

00:40.508 --> 00:43.411
We should be focused on Waltrip.
He's got, like, serious money.

00:43.544 --> 00:47.715
He's flushing profits through
the global financial market.

00:47.848 --> 00:49.617
We raided Waltrip this morning.

00:49.750 --> 00:52.320
-Did you bring him in?
-No, he wasn't there.

00:52.453 --> 00:53.754
So, where is he?

00:53.887 --> 00:55.656
I finally got the FBI
to get off this.

00:55.789 --> 00:57.591
So just move on.

00:57.725 --> 00:59.927
As you--

01:00.060 --> 01:01.562
Get an ambulance!

01:01.695 --> 01:04.232
-[sirens blaring]
-What's your name, sir?

01:04.365 --> 01:06.134
Manfredi.

01:12.773 --> 01:15.543
[thunder crashing]

01:15.676 --> 01:17.911
I'm sorry... I'm sorry.

01:18.045 --> 01:19.947
What's that, Ripple?
You're sorry?

01:20.080 --> 01:22.183
Chickie, Chickie,
enough, come on.

01:22.316 --> 01:24.218
"Come on," my balls.

01:24.352 --> 01:25.986
The man's apologizing.

01:26.120 --> 01:27.888
-Aah.
-What're you sorry for?

01:28.021 --> 01:30.991
That you saw an opportunity,
and you tried to use it

01:31.125 --> 01:34.162
-to fuck me over?
-I... I don't remember.

01:34.295 --> 01:36.530
-I really don't.
-Ripple...

01:36.664 --> 01:38.031
I really don't
fuckin' remember.

01:38.166 --> 01:39.567
Ripple the Cripple, huh?

01:39.700 --> 01:41.769
Batter up!

01:43.070 --> 01:44.272
Fuck!

01:44.405 --> 01:46.240
Guys, guys,
come on, let's go.

01:46.374 --> 01:47.908
Oh, I'm going, baby.

01:48.041 --> 01:49.577
Is it this one?

01:49.710 --> 01:51.011
[groaning]

01:51.145 --> 01:52.680
Chickie, Chickie,
don't do this.

01:52.813 --> 01:55.115
-Chickie--
-Get the fuck outta here.

01:55.249 --> 01:57.117
Go.

01:58.752 --> 02:01.289
[phone ringing]

02:01.422 --> 02:02.923
-DWIGHT: Yeah?
-Dwight.

02:03.056 --> 02:05.459
It's Armand.
They got Ripple.

02:05.593 --> 02:08.061
323 Kent Avenue, hurry.

02:08.196 --> 02:10.531
[thunder crashing]

02:10.664 --> 02:12.333
Back on the ranch,

02:12.466 --> 02:14.502
one of them there cows
get loose,

02:14.635 --> 02:15.869
we used to brand 'em

02:16.003 --> 02:17.438
so we could tell them apart.

02:17.571 --> 02:19.373
No, please, Chickie,
please, don't,

02:19.507 --> 02:20.774
please.

02:20.908 --> 02:22.776
Now, you hold
that little doggie still.

02:22.910 --> 02:24.545
Chickie, please, no.

02:24.678 --> 02:26.547
-Aah!
-Fuck off!

02:26.680 --> 02:28.449
Please don't do this,
Chickie, please,

02:28.582 --> 02:30.418
I'm begging you.
I'm begging you!

02:30.551 --> 02:32.653
I've known you guys
for a long time!

02:32.786 --> 02:35.989
-Aah!
-No, what're you doing?!

02:36.123 --> 02:37.491
Oh, fuck.

02:37.625 --> 02:39.860
Oh, come on, Armand.

02:39.993 --> 02:41.829
-Dwight, Dwight...
-The hell are you doing?

02:41.962 --> 02:43.597
-Huh?
-Dwight, Dwight...

02:43.731 --> 02:45.866
You outta your
fuckin' mind, are you?

02:45.999 --> 02:48.135
I tried to stop him,
Dwight, I really tried.

02:48.269 --> 02:50.738
-Thank God you got here.
-Get those fuckin' cuffs off.

02:50.871 --> 02:52.773
Now. Just hang in there,
all right?

02:52.906 --> 02:55.008
-CHICKIE: ...with the key!
-Where's the key?

02:55.142 --> 02:56.977
-I gave you the fuckin' key!
-What the fuck?!

02:57.110 --> 02:58.846
You didn't leave 'em
in the fuckin' car?!

02:58.979 --> 03:00.481
No, I didn't leave 'em
in the car! I gave 'em to you!

03:00.614 --> 03:03.050
-Oh, fuck.
-I told you...

03:03.183 --> 03:04.184
Oh, fuck!

03:05.719 --> 03:07.521
-Let's go!
-Fuck!

03:07.655 --> 03:09.957
Put that out!
Put it out!

03:13.193 --> 03:15.363
Oh! Oh, shit!

03:15.496 --> 03:17.731
Ripple, hang in there.

03:17.865 --> 03:20.167
-Dwight!
-Get over here!

03:20.301 --> 03:21.569
Pull, pull.

03:21.702 --> 03:23.504
Oh, shit,
it's not giving.

03:23.637 --> 03:26.307
CHICKIE:
Uncle Dwight!

03:27.308 --> 03:29.977
Hey, hold still.

03:31.412 --> 03:33.781
-[gunfire]
-[straining]

03:33.914 --> 03:35.783
-Fuckin' carbon steel!
-Get me out, please!

03:35.916 --> 03:38.586
Don't fuckin' leave me!
[coughing]

03:38.719 --> 03:40.721
-[whimpering]
-Go!

03:40.854 --> 03:43.657
Wait! What are you doing?
Get me out!

03:43.791 --> 03:47.561
[coughing]
Get me out!

03:47.695 --> 03:49.697
I can't.

03:49.830 --> 03:52.032
What the fuck are you doing?

03:52.165 --> 03:54.668
I'm not letting you
burn to death.

03:54.802 --> 03:57.170
-Sorry.
-[distant sirens wailing]

03:57.305 --> 03:59.873
Wait, wait, wait...

04:00.007 --> 04:02.242
[gunshot]

04:03.611 --> 04:05.746
[sirens nearing]

04:07.180 --> 04:08.316
[tires squealing]

04:08.449 --> 04:10.083
Put up your hands!
Get your hands up!

04:10.217 --> 04:12.886
Walk down the steps!
Keep walkin', keep walkin'!

04:13.020 --> 04:15.289
[police radio chatter]

04:17.625 --> 04:20.260
[thunder crashing]

04:22.363 --> 04:26.033
[crashing]

04:28.436 --> 04:31.639
[theme music plays]

05:36.470 --> 05:38.706
HENDRICKS: So, how do
you know Agent Beale?

05:38.839 --> 05:40.508
I don't know her.

05:40.641 --> 05:41.909
We know that you know her.

05:42.042 --> 05:43.711
We got you all over
her cell phone.

05:43.844 --> 05:45.479
Did you get
a look at who shot her?

05:45.613 --> 05:47.681
Was it Caolan Waltrip?

05:47.815 --> 05:49.417
-Who?
-Listen, pal,

05:49.550 --> 05:52.219
you think we don't know
who the fuck you are...

05:52.352 --> 05:53.621
excuse me,
who the fuck are you?

05:53.754 --> 05:54.988
Elliot Evans.

05:55.122 --> 05:57.625
I'm Mr. Manfredi's counsel.

05:57.758 --> 05:59.727
What've you told 'em?

06:00.861 --> 06:03.797
-I don't know a thing.
-Good.

06:03.931 --> 06:05.699
Are you charging
my client with a crime?

06:05.833 --> 06:07.501
-We don't know yet.
-You held him all night,

06:07.635 --> 06:09.403
-and you don't know yet?
-Well, we're questioning him.

06:09.537 --> 06:11.171
-He's being uncooperative.
-As is his right.

06:11.304 --> 06:13.273
You wanna go fishing,
gentlemen,

06:13.407 --> 06:15.242
I highly recommend
Lake Yahola.

06:15.375 --> 06:17.177
Come on.

06:18.345 --> 06:20.113
Don't leave town,
Mr. Manfredi.

06:20.247 --> 06:24.151
Who the fuck would wanna
leave this paradise?

06:26.019 --> 06:28.188
Are you even a lawyer?

06:28.321 --> 06:31.759
If I'm not,
I just committed a felony.

06:31.892 --> 06:33.927
Mr. Geigerman sent me.

06:34.061 --> 06:35.563
I usually handle
real estate matters

06:35.696 --> 06:37.931
-and weed-related offenses.
-Oh, thanks a lot.

06:38.065 --> 06:39.767
-You okay.
-Yeah, how's Stacy?

06:39.900 --> 06:41.301
She's recovering.
Out of surgery.

06:41.435 --> 06:42.803
I brought you
a change of clothes.

06:42.936 --> 06:44.938
All right, let's go.

06:52.913 --> 06:55.115
So, how're you feeling?

06:56.116 --> 06:58.786
About as good as I look.

06:58.919 --> 07:00.621
Considering
what you've been through,

07:00.754 --> 07:02.790
you look remarkable.

07:02.923 --> 07:04.525
I brought you these.

07:04.658 --> 07:06.460
Oh, Jesus,
am I that hurt?

07:06.594 --> 07:09.897
I would've done better,
but this is...

07:10.030 --> 07:12.332
-But what?
-...not flower central.

07:14.835 --> 07:17.938
You okay?
Can I sit down for a second?

07:18.071 --> 07:20.173
Yeah, make yourself at home.

07:21.408 --> 07:23.310
I've seen
some tough women in my life,

07:23.443 --> 07:27.147
but between us,
you take the cake.

07:30.183 --> 07:32.586
I owe you my life,
you know that.

07:32.720 --> 07:34.522
No shit.

07:36.289 --> 07:39.860
I know we don't have
a traditional relationship.

07:39.993 --> 07:43.030
Oh, this isn't normal to you?

07:44.364 --> 07:47.067
I'm gonna find this Waltrip.

07:48.201 --> 07:50.771
No, you're not.
He's gone.

07:50.904 --> 07:53.707
-What do you mean?
-That fucker's rich.

07:53.841 --> 07:56.877
We got his computer.
He's got a huge bank account.

07:57.010 --> 07:58.378
He's probably
already in Mexico.

07:58.512 --> 08:01.849
Your people better
get to him before I do.

08:03.851 --> 08:05.352
Yeah, I don't have people.

08:05.485 --> 08:09.122
-What do you mean?
-Dwight...

08:09.256 --> 08:11.925
I'm gonna lose my job.

08:13.093 --> 08:16.797
Consorting
with a known felon.

08:16.930 --> 08:19.232
Sharing proprietary
information.

08:19.366 --> 08:21.468
I'm gonna make it up to you.

08:29.743 --> 08:31.311
I'm gonna let you sleep.

08:32.445 --> 08:35.583
Just wanted
to come by and...

08:35.716 --> 08:37.885
see how you were doing.

08:56.203 --> 08:58.405
We store our rides.

08:58.538 --> 09:00.774
You lose your cuts.

09:00.908 --> 09:02.242
No identifying features

09:02.375 --> 09:03.944
until we're ready
to make our move.

09:04.077 --> 09:07.514
That means...
cars and trucks only

09:07.648 --> 09:09.583
until further notice.

09:10.651 --> 09:14.221
So, what do we do now?
Just lay low for a while?

09:22.195 --> 09:24.064
[sighing]
Ah, yeah.

09:25.565 --> 09:27.835
A parasite...

09:27.968 --> 09:31.371
doth feed
upon its host.

09:31.504 --> 09:33.506
And ours?

09:33.641 --> 09:37.344
Ours will not stop
until we cut him out

09:37.477 --> 09:38.946
with a...

09:39.079 --> 09:41.649
with a fuckin' broadsword.

09:44.785 --> 09:46.253
That is his nature.

09:46.386 --> 09:49.589
Now, what is
in your nature, lads? Huh?

09:49.723 --> 09:53.794
Is it to behead this fucker?

09:53.927 --> 09:57.264
His entire crew as well?

09:57.397 --> 09:58.866
Or...

09:58.999 --> 10:01.301
is it to scurry away?

10:01.434 --> 10:03.303
We already got
the ATF on our ass,

10:03.436 --> 10:05.472
the FBI too now, probably.

10:17.384 --> 10:18.986
I'm gonna say this one time.
There's a fuckin' bounty

10:19.119 --> 10:21.021
on this Waltrip's head.
Anybody see him,

10:21.154 --> 10:22.956
anywhere, anytime,
they take him out.

10:23.090 --> 10:25.058
Understood.

10:26.326 --> 10:28.161
So, listen,
there's something else.

10:28.295 --> 10:29.963
Chickie's here.

10:30.931 --> 10:33.166
-What?
-Goodie called late last night.

10:33.300 --> 10:37.004
They were already on their way.
Him, Chickie, and Vince.

10:38.471 --> 10:40.340
You wanna lay low
for a while?

10:40.473 --> 10:42.175
'Cause of that?
Fuck no.

10:42.309 --> 10:43.944
I wanna be honest with you,
Armand, this could get

10:44.077 --> 10:46.313
-fuckin' ugly.
-You know what's really ugly?

10:46.446 --> 10:49.249
Not being able
to look yourself in the mirror.

10:52.419 --> 10:56.056
Early '98, a few months
after you went away,

10:56.189 --> 10:57.791
Chickie reached out.

10:57.925 --> 11:00.093
Said he wanted to talk.

11:01.094 --> 11:03.496
It was right around
the Super Bowl.

11:03.630 --> 11:05.665
The morning of the meeting,

11:05.799 --> 11:08.802
the old club,
near Spumoni Gardens...

11:08.936 --> 11:11.404
I strapped up,
I said "fuck it."

11:11.538 --> 11:14.808
I wasn't gonna let this prick
intimidate me anymore.

11:16.109 --> 11:17.610
So I get there...

11:17.745 --> 11:19.913
park the car.

11:21.915 --> 11:23.851
And I couldn't
fuckin' get out.

11:25.218 --> 11:28.756
-What happened?
-I froze. Psychologically.

11:28.889 --> 11:31.424
I mean, my fuckin' heart,
Dwight, I thought

11:31.558 --> 11:33.026
it was gonna explode
out of my chest.

11:33.160 --> 11:35.095
There's nothing wrong
with being scared, Armand.

11:35.228 --> 11:36.964
I'm serious,
it's a natural instinct.

11:37.097 --> 11:39.967
-It's fight or flight.
-Yeah, and I chose flight.

11:43.771 --> 11:45.939
Eventually
I started driving.

11:46.907 --> 11:49.910
Hit the Verrazzano Bridge,
I-95, I just headed west--

11:50.043 --> 11:52.045
I didn't even know
where the fuck I was going.

11:53.246 --> 11:54.748
Twenty-four hours later,
after, like,

11:54.882 --> 11:57.217
two gallons of coffee,
I ended up in Tulsa.

11:57.350 --> 11:58.786
Looks like you did okay.

11:58.919 --> 12:00.888
Eh, I met my wife.

12:01.922 --> 12:04.024
Banged around.
Eventually got hired

12:04.157 --> 12:06.226
by this rancher
an hour north.

12:07.227 --> 12:09.296
Started working with horses.

12:10.463 --> 12:11.698
I hate fuckin' horses.

12:11.832 --> 12:13.266
-[chuckling]
-No joke.

12:13.400 --> 12:14.734
You cannot trust anything

12:14.868 --> 12:17.037
that can run and shit
at the same time.

12:17.170 --> 12:19.840
[laughing]

12:19.973 --> 12:22.409
All right.
That's true.

12:22.542 --> 12:24.511
It's just,
all those years,

12:24.644 --> 12:27.714
stewing, feeling
like a fuckin' coward.

12:29.249 --> 12:30.717
And then when I saw you
at the mall,

12:30.851 --> 12:32.519
it almost happened again.

12:32.652 --> 12:34.354
I thought of running.

12:35.522 --> 12:37.124
But I couldn't do it.

12:38.691 --> 12:40.828
Couldn't do it anymore.

12:42.595 --> 12:45.565
You ask me
if I wanna lay low?

12:45.698 --> 12:47.868
I ain't ever
laying low again.

12:49.102 --> 12:51.304
[country music playing]

12:56.176 --> 12:59.847
106 degrees.
You fuckin' believe that?

12:59.980 --> 13:02.382
It's like the Sahara
out here.

13:03.716 --> 13:05.986
You recover
from the flight yet?

13:06.920 --> 13:09.489
-[laughing]
-Dramamine and tranquilizer

13:09.622 --> 13:11.291
is not a good combo.

13:11.424 --> 13:14.494
Thurman Munson,
Buddy Holly, Rocky Marciano,

13:14.627 --> 13:16.830
all dead in plane crashes.

13:17.898 --> 13:19.933
What the hell?

13:22.202 --> 13:23.871
Chickie.

13:24.004 --> 13:25.472
The fuck you come from?

13:25.605 --> 13:27.540
He's here with me.

13:27.674 --> 13:29.676
I brought him.

13:29.809 --> 13:31.711
What's this?
A fuckin' ambush?

13:31.845 --> 13:34.114
If it was,
you'd be dead,

13:34.247 --> 13:36.249
and I can say the same thing
about you guys.

13:36.383 --> 13:38.685
What? I need permission?
Figured I'd come out here,

13:38.818 --> 13:41.721
-surprise you.
-Yeah, well...

13:41.855 --> 13:44.124
look how surprised we are.

13:44.257 --> 13:47.027
What is wrong with you?
It's like you've taken stupidity

13:47.160 --> 13:49.362
-to a fuckin' art form.
-Whoa...

13:49.496 --> 13:51.264
you're talking
to the boss of this family.

13:51.398 --> 13:53.901
I'm talking to the boss
of your family.

13:54.034 --> 13:56.236
You're a provocateur
and a pain in the fuckin' ass,

13:56.369 --> 13:58.471
it never made any sense.

14:00.040 --> 14:03.243
You... sent me out here...

14:03.376 --> 14:04.644
to basically die.

14:04.777 --> 14:06.980
Exile, like,
hey, Napoleon,

14:07.114 --> 14:09.082
we got this great island
for you, it's called Elba,

14:09.216 --> 14:12.185
nice view, by the way--
you're gonna die.

14:12.319 --> 14:15.255
Guess what?
We're earning.

14:15.388 --> 14:16.890
That's what you're
supposed to do.

14:17.024 --> 14:20.827
The point is,
we're fuckin' done.

14:20.961 --> 14:22.795
So, I want you
to pack your shit,

14:22.930 --> 14:26.399
get on the fuckin' plane,
and stay the fuck...

14:26.533 --> 14:29.002
out of my town.

14:29.136 --> 14:32.139
And you,
you're staying here.

14:33.073 --> 14:34.874
You really...

14:35.008 --> 14:37.945
wanna keep working
for this asshole?

14:38.078 --> 14:39.879
Look at him.
Fuckin' Kojak.

14:40.013 --> 14:42.849
You got three seconds
to make up your mind.

14:52.159 --> 14:54.761
-Smart.
-You fuckin' piece of shit.

14:54.894 --> 14:56.229
You know,
I should drop all of ya,

14:56.363 --> 14:58.565
right here,
right fuckin' now.

14:58.698 --> 15:00.767
Yeah, you should,
but you won't.

15:01.935 --> 15:04.504
See those guys?
They work for me.

15:04.637 --> 15:06.673
See those guys?

15:06.806 --> 15:08.808
They're with us.

15:08.942 --> 15:11.311
And they're gonna take
your ass to the airport,

15:11.444 --> 15:15.215
and you're never
coming back here again.

15:16.749 --> 15:18.885
It's really nice
seeing you, Chick.

15:21.521 --> 15:23.090
Come on.

15:45.378 --> 15:47.047
DWIGHT: We got
a new member on the team.

15:47.180 --> 15:49.049
Goodie Carangi.

15:49.182 --> 15:51.218
We go way back.

15:51.351 --> 15:53.720
You know, I never knew
your first name.

15:53.853 --> 15:55.288
-What is it?
-Dennis.

15:55.422 --> 15:58.625
Dennis... okay,
we're sticking with Goodie.

15:58.758 --> 16:00.827
[soft laughter]

16:00.960 --> 16:03.863
My nickname,
as most of you know,

16:03.997 --> 16:06.599
is the General.

16:06.733 --> 16:09.436
And we're going to war.

16:10.670 --> 16:11.971
I didn't want it to happen,

16:12.105 --> 16:14.141
but that's the way
it's going down.

16:14.274 --> 16:16.076
So...

16:17.344 --> 16:20.947
Grace, you really
wanna be part of this?

16:21.081 --> 16:22.549
I'm here, aren't I?

16:23.783 --> 16:25.552
Yeah, you are.

16:26.753 --> 16:29.422
Not too long ago,
I got off a plane,

16:29.556 --> 16:32.725
and I gotta say, it was like
I got off on a different planet.

16:32.859 --> 16:35.028
Everything was sideways,
upside-down.

16:35.162 --> 16:38.698
I didn't know one person.
Not one.

16:38.831 --> 16:42.169
And at my tender young age...

16:42.969 --> 16:44.537
that's scary.

16:46.106 --> 16:47.340
I admit it's scary.

16:47.474 --> 16:50.043
'Cause, to me,
being alone,

16:50.177 --> 16:52.812
living alone,

16:52.945 --> 16:54.981
and dying alone...

16:55.115 --> 16:57.184
is like
the worst curse

16:57.317 --> 17:00.087
God could ever put
on anybody.

17:01.354 --> 17:03.590
I've always thought
of life as like

17:03.723 --> 17:06.326
this one-way street,
and you head down it,

17:06.459 --> 17:10.097
and as you do, it sort of
disappears behind you.

17:10.230 --> 17:14.734
So, you can only go
one direction, forward,

17:14.867 --> 17:16.769
and looking way down there,

17:16.903 --> 17:18.971
you see a city.

17:19.106 --> 17:22.075
But it's on fire.
And it's red hot.

17:22.209 --> 17:24.744
And like I said before,

17:24.877 --> 17:26.579
you can't go back

17:26.713 --> 17:29.149
once you've started
this damn journey.

17:29.282 --> 17:31.684
You can only go forward.

17:31.818 --> 17:33.586
So...

17:33.720 --> 17:35.655
you got two choices.

17:35.788 --> 17:37.224
One...

17:40.527 --> 17:42.295
you get scared.

17:43.730 --> 17:45.698
You give up.

17:46.933 --> 17:48.501
And then you burn up.

17:50.870 --> 17:52.639
And the second one...

17:57.144 --> 17:58.945
you say fuck it!

17:59.078 --> 18:01.080
Fuck it!

18:01.214 --> 18:03.316
Fuck fear!

18:04.284 --> 18:06.286
And you barrel through it.

18:08.087 --> 18:10.123
And when you come out
on the other side,

18:10.257 --> 18:12.192
I guarantee you,
you're gonna be stronger

18:12.325 --> 18:14.194
than you ever
thought possible.

18:14.327 --> 18:16.463
But none of this shit is
ever gonna happen,

18:16.596 --> 18:20.099
unless we all cover
each other's backs,

18:20.233 --> 18:21.968
and we all...

18:22.101 --> 18:25.672
become part
of each other's family.

18:27.140 --> 18:28.975
We do that...

18:29.108 --> 18:30.410
I swear to you,

18:30.543 --> 18:32.545
we're gonna
put this fire out

18:32.679 --> 18:35.982
once and for all.

18:36.115 --> 18:38.285
[quiet agreement]

18:38.418 --> 18:41.388
All right.
Bar is open.

18:41.521 --> 18:44.591
[applause]

18:54.801 --> 18:57.036
-["singing bowl" music]
-Ahh, okay, okay.

18:57.170 --> 18:59.506
All right,
this is nice, huh?

18:59.639 --> 19:02.242
How much you pay for this,
if you don't mind me asking?

19:02.375 --> 19:04.177
Get you guys anything?

19:04.311 --> 19:05.978
You got a chair?

19:06.112 --> 19:09.015
Uh, traditional chairs are
terrible for your back.

19:09.148 --> 19:11.751
-I'll stand.
-Suit yourself.

19:11.884 --> 19:13.620
To what do I owe
the pleasure this morning?

19:13.753 --> 19:16.989
Waltrip's got a lot of money
stashed in the Cayman Islands.

19:17.123 --> 19:19.826
Well, that would explain
his lavish headquarters.

19:19.959 --> 19:22.929
The account's on a laptop.
Can you hack into it?

19:23.062 --> 19:25.698
That depends...
where is it?

19:25.832 --> 19:27.934
Well, the ATF has it.

19:28.067 --> 19:30.069
I see.

19:30.203 --> 19:32.705
-Is that a problem?
-Not necessarily.

19:32.839 --> 19:36.142
Human error as opposed
to technical proficiency

19:36.276 --> 19:37.710
accounts for 90%

19:37.844 --> 19:40.112
of malicious mischief
on the internet.

19:40.247 --> 19:41.514
English.

19:41.648 --> 19:43.049
People get hacked
because they're lazy,

19:43.182 --> 19:46.018
and government employees
aren't well-known

19:46.152 --> 19:48.788
for their puritan work ethic.

19:48.921 --> 19:50.357
I'll take that as a yes.

19:50.490 --> 19:51.924
It's a very strong "maybe."

19:52.058 --> 19:54.093
It's a very strong "yes."

19:55.395 --> 19:58.365
What're you saying?
You're going out of business?

19:58.498 --> 20:00.667
No, no, just...

20:00.800 --> 20:02.769
shutting down for a while.

20:02.902 --> 20:04.471
Doing some renovations.

20:04.604 --> 20:07.640
Maisie's gonna stay with us,
in case you need anything.

20:08.675 --> 20:10.943
I know I'm old as shit, son.

20:11.077 --> 20:14.514
But that does not mean
that I'm stupid.

20:14.647 --> 20:16.849
Them guys shot up your place.

20:16.983 --> 20:18.651
You know who they were?

20:18.785 --> 20:21.488
Biker gang out of Catoosa.

20:21.621 --> 20:22.855
Know where to find 'em?

20:22.989 --> 20:25.157
We don't,
so we're just sitting tight.

20:25.292 --> 20:29.128
Your friend Dwight,
do you trust him?

20:29.262 --> 20:31.264
I do.

20:31.398 --> 20:34.401
Sometimes you just
get a feeling.

20:34.534 --> 20:36.536
Seems like a good man.

20:36.669 --> 20:38.871
Straight shooter.

20:40.540 --> 20:42.074
I like him.

20:42.208 --> 20:44.577
You know, I hit the point
where I was getting

20:44.711 --> 20:47.046
a little too old
to be making new friends.

20:47.179 --> 20:49.282
Then one day, this fella,
looks like he stepped

20:49.416 --> 20:52.218
out of some mob movie,
walks into my joint.

20:53.185 --> 20:56.255
Can't say what, exactly,
but something told me...

20:57.490 --> 21:00.092
this man was gonna
change my life.

21:01.260 --> 21:04.196
Welcome to
the great chain robbery,

21:04.331 --> 21:08.435
as in Blockchain, Binance,
Coinbase, and MetaMask.

21:08.568 --> 21:09.969
It's like crypto, right?

21:10.102 --> 21:12.672
Yeah, that's
exactly what it is.

21:12.805 --> 21:15.608
Any of Waltrip's usernames,
files, blockchain wallets,

21:15.742 --> 21:17.510
iTunes, all vulnerable.

21:17.644 --> 21:19.211
-iTunes?
-Facebook,

21:19.346 --> 21:20.880
Instagram, iTunes.

21:21.013 --> 21:22.949
These are
all potential portals.

21:23.082 --> 21:24.917
You set up a bogus hot spot,

21:25.051 --> 21:27.887
send in a malware
Trojan horse...

21:28.020 --> 21:30.890
and unfettered access.

21:31.023 --> 21:32.992
How did you learn
all this shit?

21:33.125 --> 21:35.962
I spent five years working
at an internet startup.

21:37.063 --> 21:39.031
Hey, was this thing on
when you confiscated it?

21:39.165 --> 21:40.967
Tebbits opened it up,
with biometrics.

21:41.100 --> 21:43.069
He lifted a fingerprint.

21:43.202 --> 21:45.338
Waltrip had
more than a few on file.

21:45.472 --> 21:48.741
-Holy shit.
-What?

21:48.875 --> 21:51.277
This motherfucker
really does have money.

21:53.980 --> 21:57.817
Or should I say... "did"?

21:58.885 --> 22:00.487
What the fuck just happened?

22:00.620 --> 22:02.054
I have no idea.

22:02.188 --> 22:04.557
Hey, boss?
You need to come see this.

22:04.691 --> 22:08.327
[screaming]
No! Oh... shit!

22:08.461 --> 22:10.963
Oh...

22:11.097 --> 22:14.467
[grunting, screaming]

22:16.603 --> 22:18.471
[screaming]

22:18.605 --> 22:21.340
-[clatter]
-[screaming]

23:03.883 --> 23:05.918
-She get it?
-Yep, she get it.

23:06.052 --> 23:08.087
Just dropped it off.

23:08.220 --> 23:10.890
-So, where to?
-I'm not sure.

23:12.158 --> 23:13.893
-You okay?
-Yeah.

23:14.026 --> 23:16.729
I'm just feeling
like I shouldn't've

23:16.863 --> 23:18.865
dragged you
into all of this.

23:18.998 --> 23:20.900
We talked about this already,
it's fine.

23:21.033 --> 23:22.401
You should've listened
to your father and found

23:22.535 --> 23:24.136
-another job.
-This is what I want to do.

23:24.270 --> 23:26.405
This is what I wanna do
right now.

23:26.539 --> 23:28.775
What if something
happens to you?

23:29.576 --> 23:32.178
I coulda got killed
driving a cab, boss.

23:32.311 --> 23:35.347
Wrong place, wrong time,
it happen every single day.

23:38.384 --> 23:39.986
You know,
before I met you,

23:40.119 --> 23:43.656
I barely knew
3:00 happened twice a day.

23:43.790 --> 23:46.325
Used to wake up
in the morning, go to work,

23:46.459 --> 23:47.827
come back home,

23:47.960 --> 23:49.829
smoke some weed,
go to sleep.

23:49.962 --> 23:52.599
Next day,
do it all over again.

23:53.766 --> 23:56.135
I'm my own man now.

23:56.268 --> 23:58.304
My own crib.
My own choices.

23:58.437 --> 24:00.072
My own identity.

24:00.206 --> 24:02.609
Not what my momma think,
not what my daddy think.

24:02.742 --> 24:04.611
Nobody else.

24:05.945 --> 24:08.648
There's a way
to live your life.

24:08.781 --> 24:11.484
Stand up
for what you believe in.

24:12.652 --> 24:14.487
Take what you want.

24:15.855 --> 24:18.390
And look after your friend.

24:18.525 --> 24:20.259
You showed me that, man.

24:21.160 --> 24:23.095
You're a good man, Tyson.

24:23.229 --> 24:25.798
I'm glad it was you
that picked me up that day.

-My arm!
-Come on!

-[neighing]
-What're you laughing at?

28:24.303 --> 28:26.438
When you said you owned
a horse, I just...

28:26.572 --> 28:28.140
imagined jockeys in silks.

28:28.274 --> 28:29.876
No, this horse is
Central Park.

28:30.009 --> 28:33.379
-It's not Belmont Park.
-Right, okay.

28:34.613 --> 28:38.684
-How's Emory?
-He's good. Busy.

-Well, depends on who you ask.

28:53.933 --> 28:56.568
-Nice to meet you.
-Oh, and those are

28:56.702 --> 28:58.704
my grandkids,
Cody and Ryan.

28:58.838 --> 29:01.340
-They look good.
-They look fantastic.

29:02.508 --> 29:04.043
I'm gonna go take some pics.

29:04.176 --> 29:05.878
Okay.

29:10.749 --> 29:12.384
I haven't seen ya in a while.

29:13.319 --> 29:15.521
Did you miss me
a little bit maybe?

29:15.654 --> 29:18.124
Okay, we'll forget that.

29:18.257 --> 29:20.426
It's... taken me
a little time

29:20.559 --> 29:23.295
to put a few things
together, you know?

29:24.330 --> 29:27.166
-And are they?
-Yeah, thank God, yeah.

29:27.299 --> 29:30.169
Oh, tonight is
the grand opening,

29:30.302 --> 29:32.972
or re-opening, of this nightclub
that I'm putting together.

29:33.105 --> 29:34.841
There's music, there's food.

29:34.974 --> 29:36.909
I guarantee
you'll have a great time.

29:37.043 --> 29:38.710
From what I hear...

29:38.845 --> 29:41.080
you like gambling
a little bit?

29:41.213 --> 29:43.049
[laughing]

29:43.182 --> 29:46.485
Uh, I got
a charity event tonight.

29:49.021 --> 29:50.823
-All right.
-Can I take a raincheck?

29:50.957 --> 29:52.091
Definitely.

29:52.224 --> 29:54.460
Grandpa, come ride him!

29:54.593 --> 29:57.296
You guys got this,
you're doing great.

29:57.429 --> 29:59.131
Oh, come on, Dad.

30:00.432 --> 30:02.334
"Dad."

30:03.903 --> 30:05.571
All right,
I'll be right there.

30:05.704 --> 30:07.907
I have no choice now.

30:09.041 --> 30:10.642
-Foot out the stirrup.
-Yeah.

30:10.776 --> 30:12.111
-There you go.
-Way to go, kid.

30:12.244 --> 30:14.613
-That was great.
-Ready?

30:14.746 --> 30:16.382
-Me?
-Yeah, you.

30:16.515 --> 30:17.950
Not really.

30:18.084 --> 30:19.585
Put your left hand
on the horn--

30:19.718 --> 30:22.855
Molly, I helped you out,
Molly, you know what I'm saying?

30:22.989 --> 30:24.623
Put your left hand
on the horn.

30:24.756 --> 30:26.893
-Okay.
-Left foot in the stirrup.

30:27.026 --> 30:28.427
-Left foot in the stirrup.
-Yeah.

30:28.560 --> 30:30.262
-Wait, like that?
-Yeah, there you go.

30:30.396 --> 30:32.231
Now, you just pull yourself up
and swing your right leg

30:32.364 --> 30:35.267
-over his back.
-Okay, ready?

30:37.769 --> 30:39.538
All right.

30:41.473 --> 30:43.775
[chuckling]

30:56.688 --> 30:58.424
Clearly your relationship
with Manfredi was not only

30:58.557 --> 31:00.359
wildly inappropriate,
it's prosecutable as well

31:00.492 --> 31:02.461
should we decide
to go that route.

31:03.862 --> 31:05.831
Do you have anything
you'd like to say?

31:07.033 --> 31:09.301
Only that
I deeply regret my actions

31:09.435 --> 31:11.837
and take full
responsibility, sir.

31:11.971 --> 31:14.540
I have made it clear
to the superintendent that,

31:14.673 --> 31:16.675
notwithstanding recent events,

31:16.808 --> 31:19.045
you've been
an exemplary agent, Ms. Beale.

31:19.178 --> 31:21.547
A position seconded
by your fellow agents.

31:21.680 --> 31:23.682
Thank you, sir.

31:24.650 --> 31:26.352
Accordingly, you'll
be reinstated to full duty

31:26.485 --> 31:28.988
with a probationary period
of six months.

31:30.789 --> 31:33.625

-and know when to fold 'em"?
-Mm-hm.

-I didn't.

your attention please?

we just got our license,
and I'd like to take

32:59.045 --> 33:01.547
this opportunity
to welcome you all

possible without the support

Mr. Dwight Manfredi.

been to Spain *

33:40.552 --> 33:44.123
* But I kinda like the music *

33:45.624 --> 33:49.595
* Said the ladies are
insane there *

33:51.097 --> 33:55.201
* And they sure know
how to use it *

* They don't abuse it *

* I can't refuse it *

* Well, I've never been
to England *

34:12.718 --> 34:15.654
-Dance?
-Yeah.

for a couple of decades.

for Las Vegas *

34:32.671 --> 34:34.906

-asking for you.
-Well, who is she?

34:38.977 --> 34:42.648
-I don't know.
-All right. Be right back.

34:44.983 --> 34:48.887
* But I've been
to Oklahoma *

I was born there *

* But I really don't remember *

34:59.030 --> 35:00.966
I was hoping you'd show up.

35:01.099 --> 35:04.570
You look great.
Why don't you come inside?

35:04.703 --> 35:06.738
I can't.

-This flash drive.

Attempted bribery
of a federal agent.

35:25.791 --> 35:27.493
You have the right
to remain silent.

35:27.626 --> 35:29.228
You give up that right,
anything you say

35:29.361 --> 35:31.297
can be used
against you in court.

35:31.430 --> 35:33.899
You have a right to an attorney.
Let's get him out of here.

35:34.032 --> 35:37.169
If you can't afford an attorney,
one will be appointed to you.

35:39.671 --> 35:42.107
What the hell is going on?

35:43.575 --> 35:45.177
You should ask her.

35:53.151 --> 35:56.021
Tell me this isn't
happening again.

35:56.154 --> 35:57.923
