00:01.315 --> 00:03.107
Welcome to "Everlasting."

00:03.117 --> 00:04.708
Let's go, people.

00:04.718 --> 00:07.252
I want nudity, 911 calls, cat fights.

00:07.288 --> 00:09.313
Get me some good TV.

00:09.323 --> 00:10.981
Your suitor, Adam Cromwell!

00:10.991 --> 00:13.556
There's a lot of eyes on you.
You're the first black suitor.

00:13.567 --> 00:15.204
I need my dragon.

00:15.215 --> 00:17.173
I create conditions
for things to happen.

00:17.184 --> 00:20.324
Listen to everything I say
and just repeat after me.

00:20.334 --> 00:21.659
Will you marry me?

00:21.669 --> 00:23.059
Love is swell...

00:23.069 --> 00:24.952
but it is not something
you build a life around.

00:24.963 --> 00:26.280
How many times have you made me

00:26.291 --> 00:27.998
look like a fool
in front of these people?

00:28.008 --> 00:30.300
You want to demote me?
You demote me to my face.

00:32.578 --> 00:34.637
- Are you taking your meds?
- Don't do that, Mom.

00:34.647 --> 00:35.972
I'm sorry you feel judged.

00:35.982 --> 00:37.373
- So it's okay.
- Don't shrink me.

00:37.383 --> 00:38.958
You want to come home with me?

00:38.969 --> 00:40.376
Quinn, what is it?

00:40.386 --> 00:41.977
You want kids, and I can't have them.

00:41.987 --> 00:43.979
I won't be anybody's disappointment.

00:43.989 --> 00:46.382
Chet? What the hell are you doing here?

00:46.392 --> 00:48.250
I'm taking my kingdom back.

00:48.260 --> 00:49.819
What in the hell are you guys doing?

00:49.829 --> 00:51.271
I'm putting someone else in charge.

00:51.282 --> 00:53.055
Coleman Wasserman, come in here please.

00:53.065 --> 00:55.057
He is the one in charge now.

00:55.067 --> 00:56.758
I'm not gonna let you touch this place.

00:56.768 --> 00:58.660
I'm a reporter. That woman Mary,

00:58.670 --> 01:00.930
who jumped off the roof
last year, that was a murder.

01:00.940 --> 01:03.866
Coleman knows about Mary,
and he's about to expose us.

01:03.876 --> 01:05.428
Right now, we really have to stop him.

01:05.438 --> 01:07.415
You don't ever have to
worry about them again.

01:07.426 --> 01:08.759
I told you I'd do anything.

01:09.980 --> 01:11.997
<i> We have live breaking news at 11:00.</i>

01:12.008 --> 01:14.469
<i>Emergency crews are on the
scene of a single-car accident</i>

01:14.480 --> 01:16.247
<i>at Baywood Canyon Road.</i>

01:17.808 --> 01:20.449
<i>Lies are what kill us.</i>

01:20.459 --> 01:24.919
<i>The stress of keeping up
those lies is poison.</i>

01:24.929 --> 01:29.398
<i>Every lie we tell is one step
closer to the grave.</i>

01:49.119 --> 01:50.778
Rachel!

01:50.788 --> 01:52.354
Surprise!

01:53.591 --> 01:57.651
So, this is what you've been
doing for the past six months?

01:57.661 --> 02:00.988
Floating in the water and tending goats?

02:00.998 --> 02:03.056
Yeah, I'm, uh...

02:03.066 --> 02:05.492
I'm committed to this healing practice

02:05.502 --> 02:07.327
called "Essential Honesty."

02:07.337 --> 02:08.661
What?

02:08.670 --> 02:12.673
I mean, I'm doing my own version of
it, but it's like, no lies... ever.

02:13.843 --> 02:16.436
Wait. Is that really what you
thought your problem was?

02:16.446 --> 02:17.516
Lying?

02:19.416 --> 02:22.909
When I first got here, I was just
producing people all the time.

02:22.919 --> 02:25.620
Manipulating them into
giving me what I wanted.

02:29.859 --> 02:31.250
It's part of my program.

02:31.260 --> 02:33.152
I write down all the lies
I've ever told.

02:33.162 --> 02:36.455
Then I tally up the days
that I've been lie-free.

02:36.465 --> 02:38.925
I'm on a sober streak.

02:38.935 --> 02:43.162
Huh. Well, that's interesting.

02:43.172 --> 02:46.365
But, um...

02:46.375 --> 02:48.801
I have a better idea.

02:48.811 --> 02:53.972
Quinn, look, I know that
we said six months, but...

02:53.982 --> 02:55.340
I'm in a really good place.

02:55.350 --> 02:56.809
Well,<i> I'm</i> not.

02:56.819 --> 03:00.512
"Everlasting" is about to be
canceled for real.

03:00.522 --> 03:01.847
What?

03:01.857 --> 03:03.982
Yes. They can't get any advertisers

03:03.992 --> 03:06.217
because of the whole
PR nightmare last season.

03:06.227 --> 03:09.387
I mean, people who used to
dry-hump my leg at parties

03:09.397 --> 03:11.656
now won't even call me back.

03:11.666 --> 03:14.392
I need "Everlasting"
to be back up and running

03:14.402 --> 03:16.569
so that I can build my empire.

03:23.544 --> 03:25.570
Fine.

03:25.580 --> 03:26.846
You want me to say it?

03:31.218 --> 03:32.852
I need you.

03:35.089 --> 03:36.514
I miss you.

03:44.060 --> 03:46.822

03:46.833 --> 03:48.892
She's the female Elon Musk.

03:48.902 --> 03:51.695
She's hot, sexy, smart,

03:51.705 --> 03:53.364
but single.

03:53.374 --> 03:55.607
It's a plague of our generation.

03:59.345 --> 04:01.771
Women like her, they
do everything right...

04:01.781 --> 04:04.007
got banging careers,

04:04.017 --> 04:05.575
they've been on every dating app...

04:05.585 --> 04:07.844
but the more successful they get,

04:07.854 --> 04:10.279
the harder it is to find the right guy.

04:10.289 --> 04:12.382
- Sounds depressing.
- More like real.

04:12.392 --> 04:15.618
This is the truth
of the world out there.

04:15.628 --> 04:17.628
This could finally be our Emmy.

04:19.298 --> 04:21.891
- An Emmy?
- How about we just make our days?

04:21.901 --> 04:24.127
Or how about we start
with something simple, like,

04:24.137 --> 04:26.562
I- I don't know, nobody dies.

04:26.572 --> 04:27.763
How about that?

04:27.773 --> 04:29.698
Serena is our girl.

04:29.708 --> 04:31.366
She's the feminist suitress.

04:31.376 --> 04:33.869
- Feminist?
- Okay, listen, Gary.

04:33.879 --> 04:36.605
I know the brass upstairs
is busting your balls

04:36.615 --> 04:37.973
about all this pink-hat,

04:37.983 --> 04:40.075
female-empowerment crap and quotas.

04:40.085 --> 04:41.911
Serena ticks off a lot of boxes.

04:41.921 --> 04:43.612
I can get them off your back.

04:43.622 --> 04:46.114
You do realize that your
career's on life support, right?

04:46.124 --> 04:48.417
- Yes, Gary.
- But we covered for you.

04:48.427 --> 04:50.919
We let you throw Wagerstein
under the bus.

04:50.929 --> 04:54.089
But people like you cannot make
the same mistake twice.

04:54.099 --> 04:56.591
You mean <i> women</i> like me.

04:56.601 --> 04:59.094
Chet can live his life
like a walking bozo parade...

04:59.104 --> 05:00.728
- Hey. Hey!
- But me, I'm one and done.

05:00.738 --> 05:03.164
All right, all right, right.
Listen, it's a go.

05:03.174 --> 05:05.900
But if this goes south, like last year,

05:05.910 --> 05:07.443
you're fired.

05:10.982 --> 05:13.007
An Emmy? Nice touch.

05:13.017 --> 05:15.595
I meant it, Quinn. I got to
start thinking what I'm leaving

05:15.606 --> 05:18.512
behind for my son, especially since
I can't see him since the, uh...

05:18.522 --> 05:20.081
You kidnapped him?

05:20.091 --> 05:23.451
I want him to know
what I did with my life.

05:23.461 --> 05:26.153
- Okay.
- Hey, guys.

05:26.163 --> 05:27.955
What about Maddie?
You bringing her back?

05:27.965 --> 05:30.265
Why do you care about Madison?

05:32.336 --> 05:33.860
Ugh, you didn't.

05:33.870 --> 05:35.329
Maddie's the future, Quinn.

05:35.339 --> 05:37.330
You need her.

05:37.340 --> 05:40.575
Great. Thanks, Gary.

05:51.634 --> 05:53.946
You shouldn't have worn
shorts. Get off of channel 1.

05:53.956 --> 05:56.483
Hey, Rach. How's it going?

05:56.493 --> 05:58.184
Oh, kind of freaking out.

05:58.194 --> 06:00.353
Ooh, I can't breathe.

06:00.363 --> 06:01.795
And I've got my period.

06:01.806 --> 06:03.436
- It's pretty heavy, actually.
- Gross.

06:03.447 --> 06:05.639
Yeah, but you know what? I'm gonna
be fine. I'm gonna make it through.

06:05.650 --> 06:07.860
- I always do.
- Cool, it's nice to see you, too.

06:07.870 --> 06:09.294
- I need you to...
- It's not.

06:09.304 --> 06:11.063
- It's not what?
- Nice to see me.

06:11.073 --> 06:12.730
Dan, come on. Let's just cut the crap.

06:12.741 --> 06:14.399
Let's just be totally honest, okay?

06:14.409 --> 06:16.301
- Okay.
- We can't stand each other.

06:16.311 --> 06:17.637
I wouldn't say that. I mean...

06:17.647 --> 06:21.091
Just tell the truth. It's gonna make
you feel so much better, I swear.

06:21.684 --> 06:23.042
Okay, all right, yeah.

06:23.052 --> 06:26.077
It's, uh... It's kind of
terrifying to see you.

06:26.087 --> 06:27.646
- Right?
- Totally stresses me out.

06:27.656 --> 06:28.833
- Right? See?
- Yeah.

06:28.844 --> 06:30.525
Okay, great. This is great.
Let's keep this up.

06:30.536 --> 06:31.750
It does feel good.

06:31.760 --> 06:33.218
- I could actually...
- Is that...

06:33.228 --> 06:34.586
Is that "Essential Honesty"?

06:34.596 --> 06:36.888
That... Do... Do it on me. Do it on me.

06:36.898 --> 06:38.423
No, Chet. It's not a party trick.

06:38.433 --> 06:39.758
It's my life.

06:39.768 --> 06:41.826
Come on, little weirdo.

06:41.836 --> 06:44.428
Don't call me that, please.

06:44.438 --> 06:46.597
What, "little weirdo"?
It's a term of endearment.

06:46.607 --> 06:49.233
Okay, well, it's not funny
'cause it flips me out.

06:49.243 --> 06:51.536
Come on. I want to know
what you think about me.

06:51.546 --> 06:53.271
Tell me the truth.

06:54.883 --> 06:57.341
Fine. Um...

06:57.351 --> 07:00.378
you are an overpaid, uh,
incompetent man-baby

07:00.388 --> 07:01.779
who's riding on the backs of women

07:01.789 --> 07:03.714
who do all of your work for you.

07:03.724 --> 07:06.184
You're too dumb to know
how pathetic it is

07:06.194 --> 07:09.253
that we had to use you to push
Serena through to the network

07:09.263 --> 07:11.622
just because you were born with a dick.

07:11.632 --> 07:14.425
And I never understood what
Quinn saw in your fat, sweaty,

07:14.435 --> 07:16.894
drug-addled ass, but whatever it was,

07:16.904 --> 07:18.962
you wasted the best years of her life

07:18.972 --> 07:21.765
and destroyed the one person who
is ever gonna care about you.

07:21.775 --> 07:23.901
Hey, Rachel!

07:23.911 --> 07:26.044
So, that's the truth.

07:28.949 --> 07:31.441
I'm gonna go get my walkie now.

07:31.451 --> 07:34.578
Get back to work! Stop standing around!

07:34.588 --> 07:36.879
Don't worry about it, okay?

07:36.889 --> 07:39.749
It's just a phase.
She'll be out of it in a week.

07:39.759 --> 07:43.160
Hope she doesn't kill somebody
between now and then.

07:45.098 --> 07:46.456
Oh, hey, Rachel, listen, I...

07:46.466 --> 07:47.869
Five minutes, Graham. Five minutes.

07:47.880 --> 07:49.382
- Thank you, Rachel.
- You're welcome.

07:49.393 --> 07:51.211
- Hey, Quinn.
- Graham, just the Spanx on.

07:51.222 --> 07:53.378
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.
- Hey, loose cannon.

07:53.389 --> 07:55.631
Um, would you like to explain to me

07:55.641 --> 07:57.433
what the hell happened out there?

07:57.443 --> 07:59.936
That was just the cleansing fire
of truth.

07:59.946 --> 08:01.570
- Oh, okay.
- Mm.

08:01.580 --> 08:05.073
Well, I am going to need you
to get your shit together

08:05.083 --> 08:07.075
because Chet is still your boss,

08:07.085 --> 08:08.644
and, like it or not, Gary trusts him.

08:08.654 --> 08:10.346
- Of course he does.
- And look,

08:10.356 --> 08:13.649
I really appreciate you
standing up for me back there,

08:13.659 --> 08:15.618
seriously, but I'm fine.

08:15.628 --> 08:17.394
I'm fine, too.

08:18.797 --> 08:19.929
Okay.

08:20.633 --> 08:21.823
Jay!

08:21.833 --> 08:23.933
Hi!

08:25.575 --> 08:26.826
- Hi.
- Wow!

08:26.837 --> 08:28.964
They, like, really did a number
on you at that cult.

08:28.974 --> 08:30.531
It's not a cult. It's a farm.

08:30.541 --> 08:32.768
It's the same thing.
Rachel, it's the same thing.

08:32.778 --> 08:34.225
- Hey, welcome home, by the way.
- It's a cult.

08:34.236 --> 08:35.798
I set up our meeting for that pitch, so,

08:35.813 --> 08:37.842
as soon as we're up and running,
let me know what you got.

08:37.852 --> 08:38.938
Great.

08:38.948 --> 08:40.341
The pitch?

08:40.351 --> 08:42.042
Daddy's getting on up out of here, girl.

08:42.052 --> 08:43.477
What's the show about?

08:43.488 --> 08:45.380
Not a clue.

08:46.658 --> 08:48.115
Oh, my God.

08:48.125 --> 08:49.350
Is that Madison?

08:49.360 --> 08:50.618
What happened to the pigtails?

08:50.628 --> 08:52.820
Did you hear she sold a pilot?

08:52.830 --> 08:54.221
- Slut.
- Slut.

08:54.231 --> 08:55.499
Rachel.

08:55.510 --> 08:57.683
- I'll see you later.
- Suitress is on the driveway.

09:03.007 --> 09:04.564
Serena.

09:04.574 --> 09:06.000
- Hey.
- Hi.

09:06.010 --> 09:08.836
So good to see you again. I just... I...

09:08.846 --> 09:10.504
I honestly can't even believe
you're here.

09:10.514 --> 09:13.005
- You're such a catch. We're so lucky.
- God, really?

09:13.016 --> 09:15.639
Yeah. Let's leave the bags here.
Someone will come get them.

09:15.650 --> 09:18.845
I mean, you're investing
in every single start-up that's,

09:18.855 --> 09:21.047
I think, gonna change the world.

09:21.057 --> 09:22.582
I... Fingers crossed.

09:22.592 --> 09:24.351
- You are very sweet.
- Yeah.

09:24.361 --> 09:26.353
Oh, I can't believe I'm actually here.

09:26.363 --> 09:29.856
I'm putting my career on hold
for six weeks, but I just...

09:29.866 --> 09:31.891
I just decided that it is the best way

09:31.901 --> 09:33.827
to maximize my dating flow.

09:34.795 --> 09:36.487
Super romantic.

09:36.498 --> 09:38.198
Oh, you know, I'm just being practical.

09:38.208 --> 09:41.734
Hey, before we go in there,
how does this work?

09:41.744 --> 09:44.370
Do you guys... You give me head
shots and résumés on the guys?

09:44.380 --> 09:47.251
Oh, no, no. We just pick them for
you. It's old-school, yenta-style.

09:47.262 --> 09:48.941
- Okay, seriously?
- Seriously.

09:48.951 --> 09:51.076
I don't get to Google them,
or, you know,

09:51.086 --> 09:53.415
Facebook-stalk their last five
girlfriends or anything?

09:53.426 --> 09:54.912
- Hey...
- One second. Thanks so much.

09:54.923 --> 09:56.281
Yep.

09:56.291 --> 09:58.177
Um, you don't seem like a bullshitter.

09:58.188 --> 09:59.719
I'm currently not.

09:59.729 --> 10:01.519
Okay, good.

10:01.529 --> 10:02.963
I'm glad you're here.

10:04.066 --> 10:05.332
Rachel.

10:08.203 --> 10:10.295
Uh... nap time.

10:10.305 --> 10:12.184
Let's go, lady. Let's go.

10:12.195 --> 10:14.074
Can we talk for a second?

10:16.044 --> 10:17.869
What the hell is Jeremy doing here?

10:17.879 --> 10:19.623
Not blowing up our lives.

10:19.634 --> 10:20.920
Really? Speak for yourself.

10:20.931 --> 10:23.274
Rachel... we have to keep him close.

10:23.284 --> 10:24.642
He's a liability out there.

10:24.652 --> 10:26.745
No, Quinn, he is a liability in here.

10:26.755 --> 10:27.945
Come in.

10:27.955 --> 10:29.914
Rachel.

10:29.924 --> 10:31.716
Just hear me out, okay?

10:31.726 --> 10:34.285
I know there's no excuse
for how I was last season.

10:34.295 --> 10:36.787
But I'm... I'm sober.

10:36.797 --> 10:38.822
And I've been through
anger-management classes,

10:38.832 --> 10:41.259
and I'm just so sorry.

10:41.269 --> 10:43.633
Hitting you is the worst thing
that I've ever done.

10:43.644 --> 10:44.929
<i>That's</i> the worst thing
you've ever done?!

10:44.940 --> 10:46.797
Hey! Okay, okay, okay! Enough.

10:46.807 --> 10:50.333
Perception is reality.

10:50.343 --> 10:52.503
And right now, the perception is

10:52.513 --> 10:56.306
that there was a terrible car
crash at the end of last season.

10:56.316 --> 10:58.582
So, that is what happened.

10:58.593 --> 11:03.491
It was an accident, and we
are all in this together.

11:03.502 --> 11:05.314
And I've been thinking
about this, and...

11:06.993 --> 11:09.560
I think we need a pact,
something binding.

11:11.464 --> 11:13.156
- A blood oath.
- No, that is ridiculous.

11:13.166 --> 11:16.259
Hey, listen, we got to do
something so little weirdo

11:16.269 --> 11:19.529
and her "Essential Honesty"
doesn't destroy all of us.

11:19.539 --> 11:20.919
This isn't even hygienic.

11:20.930 --> 11:23.013
Hygienic? You want to go to jail?

11:32.184 --> 11:33.275
Fine.

11:37.957 --> 11:39.348
I'm in.

11:40.625 --> 11:42.017
You're insane, Chet.

11:42.027 --> 11:44.519
This works, Quinn. Bring it in.

11:46.565 --> 11:53.628
We vow to stay essentially
silent about this one thing.

11:53.638 --> 11:55.472
<i>Rachel, Serena won't go to set.</i>

11:59.711 --> 12:01.002
This color is fabulous.

12:01.012 --> 12:02.136
Great job. Get out.

12:02.146 --> 12:03.580
Okay.

12:05.750 --> 12:07.476
I look like a stripper mermaid.

12:07.486 --> 12:09.978
What? Are you kidding me?
You look amazing.

12:09.988 --> 12:12.180
I'd bang you standing up
if I swung that way.

12:12.190 --> 12:13.747
Rachel, tell the truth.

12:13.757 --> 12:16.025
Do I or do I not look like
a stripper mermaid?

12:19.959 --> 12:22.495
I mean, this is how all the girls
on these shows dress, okay?

12:22.506 --> 12:23.757
Sequins pop.

12:23.767 --> 12:25.726
Cleavage communicates a certain...

12:25.737 --> 12:29.405
willingness to participate
in the process.

12:30.207 --> 12:32.833
No. I brought my own dress.
I'll wear that.

12:32.843 --> 12:35.603
That'd be great, if you were
accepting the Nobel Prize,

12:35.613 --> 12:37.170
not trying to catch a husband.

12:37.180 --> 12:39.051
Okay, I don't even know
how to talk to people

12:39.062 --> 12:40.574
with my tits out this far.

12:40.584 --> 12:41.876
Well, good news...

12:41.886 --> 12:43.819
No one's gonna be listening.
Just staring.

12:45.455 --> 12:47.047
Come on, Rachel.

12:51.061 --> 12:53.420
Ugh. I can't believe I let you
talk me into her.

12:53.430 --> 12:56.023
Garage door down.

12:56.033 --> 12:57.092
Who's this guy?

12:57.103 --> 12:59.426
Oh yes.

12:59.436 --> 13:00.760
Hello, everybody.

13:00.770 --> 13:02.529
This is Dr. Simon.

13:02.539 --> 13:04.463
He is our new shrink.

13:04.473 --> 13:07.066
He's a little more qualified than Wag.

13:07.076 --> 13:08.535
Enjoy him, please.

13:08.545 --> 13:10.021
Yeah, okay, cameras in place already.

13:10.032 --> 13:11.704
- How do I look?
- Yeah, you look great.

13:11.715 --> 13:13.606
- You got your Spanx on, right?
- All right.

13:13.625 --> 13:15.775
You are fat. That's why
you're wearing a corset.

13:15.785 --> 13:17.410
On your call, madam.

13:17.420 --> 13:19.912
Are we ready to get this
sausage party started, people?

13:19.922 --> 13:21.247
- Whoo.
- Yeah.

13:21.257 --> 13:24.083
May they all be blessed with thick dicks

13:24.093 --> 13:26.652
and even thicker heads of hair.

13:29.998 --> 13:31.924
Hello, America.

13:31.934 --> 13:34.355
Welcome back to "Everlasting."

13:34.366 --> 13:37.162
Please cue the first man-wagon.

13:37.172 --> 13:38.379
<i>Bringing in car one.</i>

13:38.390 --> 13:39.932
Who's coming in?

13:39.942 --> 13:42.935
The A-Team... Owen, Jasper, and Alexi.

13:42.945 --> 13:44.436
Doc, you are up.

13:44.446 --> 13:46.805
Please give us some shrink dirt
on these dudes.

13:48.550 --> 13:50.074
Uh, no, sorry.

13:50.084 --> 13:52.255
I don't break patient/client privilege.

13:52.266 --> 13:53.778
- Oh, okay.
- Ever.

13:53.788 --> 13:55.180
Oh, that is good. That's cute.

13:55.190 --> 13:57.215
Dude, why the hell
are you even here, then?

13:57.225 --> 13:58.739
Leave it be, Jay.

13:58.750 --> 14:01.786
- It's fine.
- America would love to know...

14:01.796 --> 14:03.355
Why is Serena dressed like a nun?

14:03.365 --> 14:05.523
Because she dresses for other women,

14:05.533 --> 14:07.725
which is why she's still single.

14:07.735 --> 14:10.028
Let's, uh, start with car number one.

14:10.038 --> 14:12.186
And, uh, this is Owen.

14:12.197 --> 14:13.959
He could have left his helmet at home.

14:13.970 --> 14:15.733
We get he's a fireman.

14:15.743 --> 14:17.568
<i>My God, you're gorgeous.</i>

14:18.813 --> 14:20.137
- This is Riley.
- Oh.

14:20.148 --> 14:21.414
My baby girl.

14:21.425 --> 14:23.250
Oh, wait. Does his daughter have cancer?

14:23.261 --> 14:25.275
- No cancer.
- Oh, damn it.

14:25.286 --> 14:27.278
Mm. She's beautiful.

14:27.288 --> 14:28.922
Thank you. You're sweet.

14:28.933 --> 14:29.977
She's my heart.

14:29.988 --> 14:32.211
And I always lead with my heart, so...

14:32.222 --> 14:36.319
Bam! My single fireman
is going all the way!

14:36.330 --> 14:38.822
- Ooh, ooh, ooh!
- Okay, calm down there, sparky,

14:38.832 --> 14:41.158
'cause next up, we have Jasper...

14:41.168 --> 14:44.627
White boy, Wall Street-
by-way-of-London perfection.

14:44.637 --> 14:47.931
So, they told
me that you are incredible.

14:48.952 --> 14:51.068
I'm here to find out if that's true.

14:51.078 --> 14:55.023
Oh, I'm sorry. Did... Did
Jasper just neg her?

14:55.034 --> 14:56.672
That was really hot.

14:56.683 --> 14:58.741
Mm, or kind of like rich-boy douchey.

14:58.751 --> 15:00.276
It's such a fine line.

15:00.286 --> 15:02.445
Ooh, I guess this means
you ain't the only one

15:02.455 --> 15:04.414
with a wifey, bitch,
so I will take this.

15:04.424 --> 15:06.316
Thank you very much.

15:06.326 --> 15:10.352
Next up, we have my man-candy, Alexi.

15:10.362 --> 15:13.089
Oh, yeah. Cue the music.

15:13.099 --> 15:15.157
Hello, handsome.

15:21.574 --> 15:23.165
- That's a gay person.
- No, I wish.

15:23.175 --> 15:25.968
He's the James Dean of the dance world.

15:25.978 --> 15:27.536
He got kicked out of IBT.

15:27.546 --> 15:29.504
Yeah, had a huge coke problem.

15:29.514 --> 15:31.506
- We were so lucky we got him.
- So lucky.

15:31.516 --> 15:34.443
I saw you dance with Misty Copeland

15:34.453 --> 15:35.944
at the Balanchine Tribute.

15:35.954 --> 15:37.646
You were spectacular.

15:37.656 --> 15:39.514
I'm glad you liked it.

15:39.524 --> 15:40.982
I don't remember it.

15:40.992 --> 15:42.884
I love this guy.

15:42.894 --> 15:45.887
Next, we have Rachel Goldberg's
wet dream.

15:45.897 --> 15:48.193
- Ooh.
- Behold August.

15:48.204 --> 15:50.458
- Nice to meet you, too.
- He just got back from Africa.

15:50.468 --> 15:52.084
He volunteers for the Peace Corps.

15:52.095 --> 15:53.951
Yeah, but he has a man-bun.

15:53.962 --> 15:58.666
I have a gift from the villagers
I lived with in Kenya.

15:58.676 --> 16:01.360
Oh, my God. He's so
soulful and intelligent.

16:01.371 --> 16:02.438
Okay.

16:02.449 --> 16:04.188
So, how long till you
bed this dude, Rach?

16:04.199 --> 16:05.673
I'm not gonna bed him.

16:05.683 --> 16:07.841
I'm not. I'm actually celibate.

16:09.353 --> 16:12.299
- Yeah, right.
- Yes, it's part of my program.

16:12.310 --> 16:13.981
Just trying to keep it together here.

16:13.991 --> 16:15.516
Okay, that'll last.

16:15.526 --> 16:17.484
Next we have Norman.

16:17.494 --> 16:19.052
Oh! Look at that guy.

16:19.062 --> 16:21.054
- A wee little man.
- He's so little and cute.

16:21.064 --> 16:22.823
Norman, Kentucky Derby jockey.

16:22.833 --> 16:24.299
- Hello.
- Hello.

16:24.310 --> 16:26.536
- Lovely to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

16:26.904 --> 16:30.430
Ooh, Serena is pissed.

16:30.440 --> 16:31.776
Is he looking for love

16:31.787 --> 16:34.815
or just someone to take him
for a ride on the Matterhorn?

16:34.826 --> 16:36.517
What are we gonna do with this shorty?

16:36.528 --> 16:38.908
We're gonna have to pair him up
with the tallest guy here,

16:38.919 --> 16:41.007
see if we can get
his Napoleon complex going.

16:41.017 --> 16:43.276
Maybe he'll get in a fistfight
by episode two.

16:43.286 --> 16:45.512
He'll be, like, swinging
right for the belly button.

16:45.522 --> 16:47.280
Nice job, Madison.

16:47.290 --> 16:48.704
- Good TV.
- You're such a kiss ass.

16:48.715 --> 16:50.116
All right, everybody.

16:50.126 --> 16:51.684
We have a lot to prove

16:51.694 --> 16:53.385
and I've got a lot to lose.

16:53.395 --> 16:55.955
So, let's make sure
that Miss Fancy-Pants...

16:55.965 --> 16:58.527
Has a drink in her hands at all times.

16:58.538 --> 17:01.121
We got to rip that stick
out from her ass.

17:01.132 --> 17:02.582
Am I right? Go!

17:02.593 --> 17:05.363
It's gonna be a great season.
Let's do this!

17:05.388 --> 17:08.382
Oh, God. Please let us
have a great season.

17:10.145 --> 17:11.866
Your last shrink

17:11.877 --> 17:14.925
actually gave you guys
confidential information?

17:14.936 --> 17:16.996
- Yeah, pretty much.
- That's disgusting.

17:17.007 --> 17:19.082
Hey, listen hat's off, man.

17:19.093 --> 17:20.839
You're a real-ass shrink.
That's something.

17:20.849 --> 17:22.229
That's what it says
on the business card.

17:22.240 --> 17:23.301
How'd you end up here?

17:23.313 --> 17:24.804
I just needed a change, you know.

17:24.814 --> 17:26.673
I was working as a
corporate crisis counselor

17:26.683 --> 17:28.241
for the last decade...

17:28.251 --> 17:30.243
clients who were at a breaking point.

17:30.253 --> 17:32.278
Meaning what, exactly?

17:32.288 --> 17:34.522
I solve problems... quickly.

17:36.693 --> 17:38.284
- Really?
- Yeah.

17:38.294 --> 17:39.752
You any good at it?

17:39.762 --> 17:41.854
Usually, yeah.

17:41.864 --> 17:45.032
Usually. That sounds like a story.

17:46.702 --> 17:50.163
My last client was a, uh,
Wall Street trader

17:50.173 --> 17:52.198
facing significant stress from work,

17:52.208 --> 17:53.466
as well as a family breakup.

17:54.201 --> 17:56.701
And so, what, you resolved his issues?

17:57.188 --> 17:58.454
Not exactly.

18:00.389 --> 18:02.339
He went postal.

18:03.210 --> 18:05.477
Shot and killed his colleague...

18:05.487 --> 18:06.753
under my care.

18:09.692 --> 18:11.349
Wow.

18:11.359 --> 18:17.489
You see? You're not the only
who can be... essentially honest.

18:17.499 --> 18:19.733
Rachel? Rachel?

18:19.744 --> 18:21.560
- Yeah, I'm trying.
- A jockey? Seriously?

18:21.570 --> 18:23.976
- We're gonna have to talk about this.
- Hey, Serena, uh,

18:23.987 --> 18:26.387
we got to get you in there.
You want to just come with me?

18:26.398 --> 18:28.122
- This is sparkling cider, right?
- Sure is.

18:28.133 --> 18:30.134
No booze tonight. Tell everyone.
I mean, all the people.

18:30.144 --> 18:31.645
I told everyone. I told everybody.

18:31.656 --> 18:32.804
It's perfect. Wing it.

18:32.814 --> 18:34.405
Okay, guys.

18:34.415 --> 18:37.508
Um, to a superior and effective season.

18:38.531 --> 18:41.980
- All right.
- And all the dicks just went limp.

18:41.990 --> 18:43.514
<i>- Na zdorovie.</i>
- Bravo.

18:43.524 --> 18:45.483
Cheers.

18:45.493 --> 18:47.384
Ugh, she's boring. Goldberg, go.

18:47.394 --> 18:48.860
Make my pussy wet now!

18:52.050 --> 18:54.443
I'm a rancher, not just a cowboy.

18:54.453 --> 18:56.257
Oh, hoping you're not a vegetarian.

18:56.268 --> 18:58.413
No, no, no. I love a good rib eye.

18:58.424 --> 18:59.851
I bet you do.

18:59.862 --> 19:01.646
Will you excuse me for just one second?

19:01.657 --> 19:03.482
- Yeah. Right on.
- Okay. Thanks.

19:03.492 --> 19:06.551
Want to introduce you to Zach.
He has 3 1/2 million followers.

19:06.562 --> 19:08.422
That's so many.
It's so nice to meet you.

19:08.433 --> 19:10.327
Can you give me just
one second, really quick?

19:10.338 --> 19:11.689
Can I talk to you for a second?

19:11.699 --> 19:13.691
- So, Rachel.
- Yes?

19:13.701 --> 19:15.744
What are you doing with Norman?
He's clearly here

19:15.755 --> 19:17.794
as a sight guy, which is cruel.

19:17.805 --> 19:20.595
Come on. So many women
find jockeys attractive.

19:20.606 --> 19:21.660
I have done my research.

19:21.671 --> 19:23.426
I know that you have backup guys
in the hotel somewhere.

19:23.437 --> 19:26.003
Please get rid of Norman
and get me someone real.

19:26.013 --> 19:28.025
- We can't. But...
- Please get me someone real.

19:28.036 --> 19:31.976
Rachel, honestly... in heels,
I'm like a foot taller than him.

19:31.986 --> 19:34.645
Can you honestly tell me
that makes sense?

19:38.192 --> 19:40.284
You're right, okay?

19:40.294 --> 19:42.486
- He is here for entertainment.
- Thank you.

19:42.496 --> 19:44.355
But he is very good for the show.

19:44.365 --> 19:45.990
I don't care about the show.

19:46.000 --> 19:49.226
Okay, Norman gives us at least
three episodes of story,

19:49.236 --> 19:53.163
so I am just asking you,
okay, as a favor to me,

19:53.173 --> 19:55.366
can you please, just, don't cut him?

19:55.376 --> 19:57.333
Okay.

19:57.343 --> 19:59.569
- Jasper.
- What is going on, superstar?

19:59.579 --> 20:01.571
You want to, like, get in there?

20:01.581 --> 20:05.709
Yes. I am, uh... deep in that.

20:05.719 --> 20:07.143
Okay, check this, Quinn.

20:07.153 --> 20:08.717
Are you not having fun,

20:08.728 --> 20:11.414
or you're just a
stand-on-the-sidelines kind of guy?

20:11.424 --> 20:14.917
Oh, no. I'm not at all a
stand-on-the-sidelines kind of guy.

20:14.927 --> 20:17.520
I run my own private equity
firm, which specializes in alt...

20:17.530 --> 20:20.209
Alternative energy. Yes, I Googled you.

20:20.220 --> 20:22.685
- What the...
- Where did you get a phone?

20:22.696 --> 20:23.860
Yeah, exactly.

20:23.871 --> 20:26.985
I convinced some 19-year-old P.A.
from Kansas to let me use his.

20:26.996 --> 20:30.860
Uh, which one
of you numb-nuts is from Kansas?

20:30.871 --> 20:32.248
<i> Uh, go for Tommy.</i>

20:32.259 --> 20:33.850
Oh, hi, Tommy.

20:33.860 --> 20:35.252
You're fired!

20:35.262 --> 20:37.321
Ha ha! First one of the night.

20:37.331 --> 20:39.189
- Feels good.
- I have to ask you...

20:40.290 --> 20:42.958
What are you doing here on this show?

20:42.969 --> 20:44.328
Same thing as you.

20:44.338 --> 20:46.029
Oh, you're looking for a husband.

20:46.039 --> 20:47.931
- I am, yes. You'd heard.
- Oh!

20:47.941 --> 20:49.632
Do you know where I could find anybody?

20:49.642 --> 20:52.803
There's a few eligible bachelors around.

20:52.813 --> 20:54.771
Oh, very charming now all of a sudden.

20:54.781 --> 20:56.139
I went on a trip last year.

20:56.149 --> 20:58.400
I took myself
on a heli-skiing tour in Niseko.

20:58.411 --> 21:00.977
- I don't know if you've ever been...
- Yes, I love Japan.

21:00.987 --> 21:02.279
I just came from there.

21:02.289 --> 21:05.147
Well, it was incredible... really.

21:05.157 --> 21:06.482
Champagne powder,

21:06.492 --> 21:07.883
biggest flakes you have ever seen.

21:07.893 --> 21:09.652
Endless ancient pines.

21:09.662 --> 21:14.083
Really, my senses were just
overwhelmed with... with beauty.

21:15.034 --> 21:16.992
But I looked around, and I realized

21:17.002 --> 21:20.570
that it was just me and
a bunch of strangers on a tour.

21:24.009 --> 21:26.802
I don't ever want to feel
that alone again.

21:26.812 --> 21:29.038
And... panty drop.

21:29.048 --> 21:30.583
Thank you very much.

21:30.594 --> 21:33.042
Now all of America wants to marry him.

21:33.952 --> 21:35.677
What are we gonna do about that?

21:36.671 --> 21:37.777
Indeed.

21:37.788 --> 21:40.314
Well, I think you're going to take me

21:40.324 --> 21:42.157
on the first one-on-one date.

21:46.111 --> 21:49.389
Well, then, I think you're
gonna have to earn it.

21:50.415 --> 21:52.314
I will.

21:54.636 --> 21:56.214
Hey, Serena.

21:56.870 --> 21:58.265
- Hey.
- Hi.

21:58.275 --> 22:00.050
Wow. I'm glad I caught you.

22:00.061 --> 22:02.114
I mean, this is a kind
of crowded field here.

22:02.125 --> 22:04.335
Yes, there are a lot
of interesting guys here.

22:04.381 --> 22:06.206
I'm only interested in you.

22:06.216 --> 22:08.746
Norman, can I talk to you
for just a quick second?

22:08.757 --> 22:09.910
Yeah.

22:09.920 --> 22:13.179
And this is where magic happens.

22:13.189 --> 22:14.547
Oh, my gosh.

22:14.557 --> 22:17.684
Wow. There are just,
like, so many screens.

22:17.694 --> 22:19.719
I don't even know where to look.

22:19.729 --> 22:20.953
Uh, excuse me.

22:20.963 --> 22:22.555
Oh, I'm so sorry.

22:22.565 --> 22:23.723
- I...
- Here.

22:23.733 --> 22:26.005
Oh, you must be Quinn.

22:26.016 --> 22:29.362
I've heard so much about you.
I'm Crystal.

22:29.372 --> 22:31.297
Okay.

22:31.307 --> 22:35.134
Oh, um I am a student of Chet's.

22:35.620 --> 22:37.776
And girlfriend. You don't
have to be embarrassed.

22:37.787 --> 22:40.851
I'm not embarrassed. I'm
trying to be professional.

22:40.862 --> 22:43.542
I'm so super impressed by what you do.

22:43.552 --> 22:46.278
And what do you do, Crystal?

22:46.646 --> 22:48.337
I am a model.

22:48.348 --> 22:51.108
Swimsuits mostly, but that's
just to put me through...

22:51.118 --> 22:52.977
Calgrove?

22:52.987 --> 22:54.476
Extension, but...

22:54.487 --> 22:56.013
Fantastic.

22:56.023 --> 22:57.982
Listen, I-I don't want
to waste your time.

22:57.992 --> 23:00.985
- Well, we've got all night.
- No, I mean, on the show.

23:00.995 --> 23:04.488
T-The producers want me to keep
you, but it's a novelty thing.

23:04.498 --> 23:06.657
They're not taking you seriously.

23:06.667 --> 23:08.659
Not taking me seriously?
I'm an elite athlete.

23:08.669 --> 23:12.028
I know, I know, which is why I don't
want them playing you for laughs.

23:12.038 --> 23:15.165
Oh, well, thank you.
I-I appreciate that.

23:15.175 --> 23:18.701
So... I'm gonna cut you right now.

23:18.711 --> 23:20.369
<i>- What?!</i>
- What?

23:20.379 --> 23:22.338
No! Cut! Cut! Cut!

23:22.348 --> 23:23.673
This is unbelievable.

23:25.814 --> 23:28.037
- What the hell is she doing?
- Hey, listen, I told her.

23:28.048 --> 23:29.174
I asked her not to cut him.

23:29.185 --> 23:31.468
- You asked her? That's so sweet of you.
- Rachel.

23:31.479 --> 23:33.883
I'm sorry. Don't talk to her.
Talk to me.

23:33.893 --> 23:36.151
Fine. I told Rachel I want a backup guy.

23:36.161 --> 23:37.795
Now you have to get me one.

23:38.603 --> 23:39.622
I'll handle it, okay?

23:39.633 --> 23:41.608
Yeah, you'd better 'cause
this is your choice.

23:41.619 --> 23:43.392
You get her under control.

23:43.402 --> 23:44.660
Hey.

23:44.670 --> 23:46.729
Uh... are you okay?

23:46.739 --> 23:48.230
I don't know.

23:48.240 --> 23:49.732
Can I get you a drink?

23:49.742 --> 23:51.233
Actually, can you get me out of here?

23:51.243 --> 23:52.500
Yeah.

23:52.510 --> 23:53.568
- Great.
- Yeah.

23:53.578 --> 23:56.705
I told you, she's smart. We
can't handle her the same way.

23:56.715 --> 23:59.582
- I mean, you would never stand for...
- She is not me.

24:01.987 --> 24:04.246
Oh, my God.

24:04.256 --> 24:06.849
Is that why you're doing this?

24:06.859 --> 24:08.983
Is that why you picked her?

24:08.993 --> 24:11.219
Look at me.

24:11.229 --> 24:14.322
She is not the avatar for you or me

24:14.332 --> 24:17.024
nor is she the ambassador
for smart women everywhere.

24:17.034 --> 24:20.194
She is the star
of a reality television show

24:20.204 --> 24:22.330
that I have to make work.

24:22.340 --> 24:23.865
I know.

24:23.875 --> 24:26.200
The most feminist thing
you could do right now

24:26.210 --> 24:28.677
is help me.

24:33.522 --> 24:36.089
Oh, wow. Look at that view.

24:39.351 --> 24:42.374
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. It's...

24:43.288 --> 24:44.513
- O...
- Owen!

24:44.523 --> 24:46.080
- Uh-huh.
- Owen.

24:46.090 --> 24:47.682
- Yes.
- Hi.

24:47.692 --> 24:50.685
I'm here to date you.

24:50.695 --> 24:52.954
Oh, God. This is...

24:52.964 --> 24:55.623
Oh, this is all so overwhelming.

24:55.633 --> 24:59.321
Really? You seem so confident.

24:59.332 --> 25:00.928
I-I don't know. I would have thought

25:00.938 --> 25:02.782
this was just another
Monday night for you.

25:02.793 --> 25:06.268
Okay, listen... my life is a lot
more boring than people think.

25:06.279 --> 25:09.022
- Mm.
- I mean, 26 first dates

25:09.033 --> 25:12.192
all at the same time is a lot.

25:12.202 --> 25:14.628
Yeah, I know the feeling.

25:14.638 --> 25:17.631
We had some bad nights when
I was stationed in Fallujah.

25:17.641 --> 25:20.034
I got separated from my company.

25:20.044 --> 25:22.469
Saved a little boy from being killed.

25:22.479 --> 25:24.671
- It was just...
- All right, all right. Okay.

25:24.681 --> 25:26.706
I'm... I'm a jerk.

25:26.716 --> 25:28.074
Nah.

25:28.084 --> 25:32.178
This place is all
a bit much for me, too.

25:32.188 --> 25:33.847
- Pretty simple guy.
- Oh, yeah?

25:33.857 --> 25:37.684
Just a simple guy
who fought for his country

25:37.694 --> 25:41.487
and now rescues little old
ladies from burning buildings.

25:41.497 --> 25:43.656
Well, sometimes it is kittens.

25:43.666 --> 25:44.890
Of course it is.

25:48.337 --> 25:50.896
Thank you for the jailbreak.

25:50.906 --> 25:53.507
You're very welcome. My pleasure.

25:56.679 --> 26:00.948
I think this is the part
where I'm supposed to kiss you.

26:02.585 --> 26:05.678
So, why don't you?

26:20.130 --> 26:22.506
Hey, Quinn, um, we haven't
really had a chance to talk yet.

26:22.517 --> 26:23.525
Haven't we?

26:23.536 --> 26:25.263
I'm just grateful that
you asked me back.

26:25.273 --> 26:26.814
And I want you to know,
what happened with Gary,

26:26.825 --> 26:28.649
it was a one-time thing.
I met him at a party.

26:28.660 --> 26:29.934
No.

26:29.944 --> 26:32.070
You made sure you did.

26:32.080 --> 26:33.304
Okay.

26:33.314 --> 26:35.607
Well, that's over.

26:35.617 --> 26:38.242
And your respect means everything to me.

26:38.252 --> 26:41.278
And I don't want you to think
that I'm just my pussy.

26:43.324 --> 26:44.916
Then prove it.

26:44.926 --> 26:46.283
Where the hell is Rachel?

26:46.293 --> 26:48.419
And where the hell is my suitress?!

26:48.429 --> 26:49.987
Find her!

26:49.997 --> 26:51.922
That was very fun.

26:51.932 --> 26:54.592
- Thank you for springing me.
- Ah, you're welcome.

26:54.602 --> 26:56.826
Okay. What the hell
are you doing out here?

26:56.837 --> 26:59.630
- Can we hitch a ride?
- Yes, you can.

26:59.640 --> 27:01.332
Hey, you.

27:01.342 --> 27:02.966
Don't ever sneak off campus again.

27:02.976 --> 27:04.909
- Okay.
- Bye.

27:06.846 --> 27:08.713
We just kissed. Can you believe it?

27:08.724 --> 27:11.650
Yes, I can. You know, I'm
the one that hand-picked him for you.

27:11.661 --> 27:13.243
Why are you mad at me?

27:13.253 --> 27:14.845
You just can't have first kisses

27:14.855 --> 27:16.947
or anything else important
off-camera, okay?

27:16.957 --> 27:19.815
Yeah, well, I can't promise that
that's not gonna happen, Rachel.

27:19.825 --> 27:21.751
Okay, you know what, Serena?

27:21.761 --> 27:23.159
If you don't play ball,

27:23.170 --> 27:25.190
Quinn is gonna screw you
just to have a good story.

27:25.201 --> 27:27.990
Oh, please, I watched the last
six seasons in two weeks.

27:28.000 --> 27:29.234
She always protects the star.

27:29.245 --> 27:32.460
No, she always protects the <i> show,</i> okay?

27:32.471 --> 27:33.862
We've had bad-boy suitors before.

27:33.873 --> 27:36.523
You think she's gonna think twice
before turning you into a bitch?

27:36.534 --> 27:37.554
How could she do that?

27:37.565 --> 27:40.249
By airing the footage of you cutting
Norman in the opening night,

27:40.260 --> 27:42.271
not even having the decency

27:42.281 --> 27:44.339
to wait for the elimination ceremony.

27:44.349 --> 27:46.375
You are smart, pretty, and successful.

27:46.385 --> 27:48.610
Half of America already hates you.

27:48.620 --> 27:50.813
I mean, if that footage
gets out, you better hope

27:50.823 --> 27:52.181
your future husband is back there,

27:52.191 --> 27:53.515
that he's one of those 26 guys.

27:53.525 --> 27:55.284
Otherwise, I mean, you're screwed.

27:55.294 --> 27:58.152
Yes, America is gonna know
exactly who you are,

27:58.162 --> 28:01.121
but just no guy is ever
gonna want to date you,

28:01.131 --> 28:02.598
like, ever.

28:04.968 --> 28:06.860
So, what do I do?

28:06.870 --> 28:09.230
You kiss Norman.

28:09.240 --> 28:10.798
What? Why?

28:10.808 --> 28:12.700
Listen, because, if you kiss
the short guy...

28:12.710 --> 28:14.367
the least expected guy here...

28:14.377 --> 28:16.036
you instantly make yourself likeable

28:16.046 --> 28:18.038
and you get America
rooting for you again.

28:18.048 --> 28:20.732
Yes, or I make myself an enormous joke.

28:20.742 --> 28:23.703
- Come on. This is not part of the plan.
- Your plans are for shit.

28:23.713 --> 28:26.346
You're on a reality show
trying to find a husband.

28:29.259 --> 28:32.260
You have done everything else,
and it hasn't worked.

28:35.031 --> 28:37.532
Just give me a chance
to make this right for you.

28:41.605 --> 28:43.738
I'm gonna need a drink.

28:47.577 --> 28:49.982
Yeah, yeah, I feel stupid,
and I'm pissed.

28:49.993 --> 28:52.263
I-I got a producer saying that.
that I need to shut up.

28:52.274 --> 28:54.620
- I got another one ignoring me.
- Yes, get her drinking.

28:54.631 --> 28:56.576
Give her another shot.
Make her take another one.

28:56.587 --> 28:58.045
- the butt of the joke here.
- Hi, Norman.

28:58.056 --> 29:00.318
- This is ridiculous.
- Can I talk to you for a second?

29:00.904 --> 29:03.017
So, uh...

29:03.027 --> 29:06.102
I just... I know
I made a mistake earlier,

29:06.113 --> 29:08.188
and I-I didn't mean to cut you.

29:08.198 --> 29:10.657
I made a rush to judgment.

29:10.668 --> 29:12.930
- Uh, thank you.
- Yeah.

29:12.941 --> 29:14.761
Thank you for saying that.
I appreciate it.

29:14.771 --> 29:16.201
It shouldn't surprise me, though.

29:16.212 --> 29:18.443
Honestly, I'm pretty
used to being underestimated.

29:18.454 --> 29:20.516
Most people don't even realize
the strength it takes

29:20.532 --> 29:22.002
to harness a thoroughbred. I mean...

29:22.012 --> 29:24.070
Oh! Yes.

29:24.080 --> 29:26.940
Ride that pony, Missy. Ride it.

29:26.950 --> 29:28.330
Nice work, Rachel.

29:28.341 --> 29:30.010
You're a wild little filly, aren't you?

29:33.122 --> 29:35.214
Get them off.

29:35.224 --> 29:37.517
Come on. Come on. Yeah!

29:52.641 --> 29:54.541
Whoo!

30:12.393 --> 30:14.452
Here's to you, Goldie. Nice work.

30:14.462 --> 30:18.389
That ass is officially stick-free.

30:19.135 --> 30:20.307
Yes.

30:25.306 --> 30:27.598
Okay. Looks like you got enough there,

30:27.608 --> 30:30.501
and she's clearly had
way too much to drink.

30:30.511 --> 30:32.336
I'm not really comfortable with this.

30:32.346 --> 30:34.671
Well, you better get comfortable, okay?

30:34.681 --> 30:36.582
This is how we make the show work.

30:42.155 --> 30:44.780
I can feel you guys. What?

30:45.665 --> 30:48.484
Okay. Okay. Fine. Fine.

30:48.495 --> 30:50.754
We're running out of hard night anyways.

30:51.283 --> 30:54.440
Bunch of pussies. Cut, cut, cut.

30:54.451 --> 30:56.093
All right, go on, Goldberg.

30:56.103 --> 30:58.628
Go get Miss Fancy-Pants ready
for the elimination ceremony.

31:00.873 --> 31:02.198
Serena?

31:02.208 --> 31:03.966
Yes! Yes!

31:12.652 --> 31:14.310
Dude, oh, my God! Oh, my God!

31:14.320 --> 31:15.645
Okay. Stop.

31:15.655 --> 31:17.446
Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on.

31:17.456 --> 31:19.515
Okay, let's go.

31:19.525 --> 31:21.117
Oh my...

31:21.127 --> 31:23.480
Okay, I just told you to kiss the guy.

31:23.491 --> 31:26.225
I know. And then I just did that.

31:27.539 --> 31:28.724
Um...

31:28.734 --> 31:30.793
- Um...
- Oh, my God.

31:30.803 --> 31:32.636
Okay, come here. It's okay. Come on.

31:40.011 --> 31:41.870
- There you go.
- Oh.

31:41.880 --> 31:44.753
- Oh, I don't know what happened.
- Oh, my God. Don't worry about it.

31:44.764 --> 31:48.143
- It happens to the best of us.
- So not like me.

31:48.153 --> 31:49.744
Maybe it was something I ate.

31:49.754 --> 31:52.147
Oh, I don't know. You think it
was all that tequila you ate

31:52.157 --> 31:53.381
- on that empty stomach?
- No.

31:53.391 --> 31:54.816
Rachel, you don't understand.

31:54.826 --> 31:58.653
I... I never do this.

31:58.663 --> 32:00.689
I mean, I don't...

32:00.699 --> 32:04.192
I don't even kiss guys
until the third date.

32:04.202 --> 32:07.094
I don't text first.
I don't... I don't use emojis.

32:07.104 --> 32:10.800
I mean, my mother gave me a copy
of the rules in sixth grade.

32:10.811 --> 32:13.000
God. How could I do that?

32:13.010 --> 32:15.835
Are you kidding me? Come on. You're
like everybody else on this planet.

32:15.846 --> 32:18.272
You are screwed up and lonely
and figuring it out.

32:18.282 --> 32:20.708
Yeah, maybe your friends are like that.

32:20.718 --> 32:25.278
My friends are all married
to very beautiful people

32:25.288 --> 32:28.215
who went to incredible schools

32:28.225 --> 32:31.152
and made sensible
real-estate investments

32:31.163 --> 32:32.963
for their future kids.

32:36.633 --> 32:39.892
Do you have any idea what it feels like

32:39.902 --> 32:44.772
to walk into Sunday brunch
full of those couples...

32:45.859 --> 32:46.890
Alone?

32:49.412 --> 32:51.705
I don't.

32:51.715 --> 32:53.715
But I can imagine it feels like shit.

32:57.486 --> 33:03.315
The weird thing is,
I did everything right.

33:03.325 --> 33:06.660
I did everything just like them.

33:08.998 --> 33:11.231
My friends say that I'm too picky...

33:13.454 --> 33:16.555
that no guy is good enough.

33:18.741 --> 33:20.674
But the truth is...

33:23.646 --> 33:25.679
nobody picks me.

33:27.348 --> 33:30.142
Look, you listen to me.

33:30.152 --> 33:32.978
You're incredible.

33:32.988 --> 33:36.014
You deserve to find somebody who
loves you just the way you are.

33:36.024 --> 33:38.250
I promise.

33:38.260 --> 33:40.226
I'm gonna make that happen.

33:42.363 --> 33:44.129
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

33:54.692 --> 33:57.660
Okay. Let's do this.

34:00.856 --> 34:03.379
Tonight, half of you will say goodbye,

34:03.390 --> 34:05.619
while the other half of you
will say hello

34:05.629 --> 34:08.788
to a brand-new slow watch.

34:08.797 --> 34:13.324
With its sole 24-hour dial,
the slow Jo is proof

34:13.335 --> 34:18.164
that minimalism and luxury
can go hand in hand.

34:18.174 --> 34:20.025
Was that your idea, these commercials?

34:20.036 --> 34:22.434
- You're welcome.
- Serena, the floor is yours.

34:22.444 --> 34:24.637
It's been a really great evening.

34:24.647 --> 34:27.339
And I'm thrilled that you're all here,

34:27.349 --> 34:29.315
and I look forward to what comes next.

34:31.152 --> 34:32.844
August.

34:32.853 --> 34:34.146
Okay, yes.

34:34.156 --> 34:35.455
Saw that coming.

34:36.458 --> 34:40.452
- Alexi.
- Yeah, sexy Alexi, get it.

34:40.462 --> 34:42.688
- Warren.
- The cowboy.

34:42.697 --> 34:46.058
Fly-over state, people, fly-over states.

34:46.068 --> 34:48.326
Zach.

34:48.335 --> 34:51.228
- Yes!
- Are we gonna have to bring his nanny?

34:51.239 --> 34:53.400
<i>- Preston.</i>
- Oh, oh,<i> he</i> could be his nanny.

34:53.411 --> 34:54.465
Perfect.

34:54.475 --> 34:57.468
- Jasper.
- Jasper. Thank you.

34:57.479 --> 34:59.576
He is perfect, isn't he?

34:59.587 --> 35:01.451
Don't screw that up, Jay.

35:04.919 --> 35:07.645
- Owen.
- Okay, Rachel. You got one.

35:07.655 --> 35:09.314
I want you to know that
our moment tonight

35:09.324 --> 35:11.416
was really great.

35:11.426 --> 35:13.251
Probably one of the best.

35:13.261 --> 35:16.386
Oh, isn't that sweet?

35:16.396 --> 35:20.191
Oh, look at the big balls
on that little fella.

35:20.201 --> 35:22.727
You know, jockeys have...
There's a lot of testosterone

35:22.737 --> 35:24.494
in a concentrated area.

35:24.504 --> 35:26.670
Well, I got to hand to him.
He does have swagger.

35:26.681 --> 35:28.999
That must have been one hell of a kiss.

35:29.009 --> 35:31.768
Look, nice work, Rachel. Nice work.

35:31.778 --> 35:34.157
This is gonna be a great season.

35:34.168 --> 35:36.301
This is the last watch of the night.

35:42.422 --> 35:43.747
Billy.

35:43.757 --> 35:48.017
Are you kidding me? What the hell?

35:48.027 --> 35:49.886
Well, guys, um...

35:49.896 --> 35:51.454
Now, how did that happen, Rachel?

35:51.464 --> 35:53.957
that concludes our elimination ceremony

35:53.967 --> 35:55.666
this evening.

35:57.213 --> 35:58.545
Hey.

35:59.127 --> 36:02.889
Ah, so you cut Norman anyway.

36:02.900 --> 36:04.819
- I did.
- Why did you do that?

36:04.830 --> 36:07.489
So he wouldn't be around and
tell anybody you guys had sex?

36:07.499 --> 36:10.859
No, I cut Norman because he's
never gonna be my husband.

36:10.869 --> 36:13.236
I made a mistake, obviously,

36:13.247 --> 36:15.347
but I assure you, it
will never happen again.

36:22.147 --> 36:25.173
The truth is, I'm a shark.
I am very ambitious.

36:25.183 --> 36:27.261
I'm really, really good at my job

36:27.272 --> 36:29.178
and I don't want to have to
apologize for that.

36:29.189 --> 36:31.379
- Okay, no. Just cut.
- Everything that I've wanted...

36:31.389 --> 36:32.714
- <i>I've achieved.</i>
- Cut, cut, cut.

36:32.724 --> 36:34.482
Nobody's gonna want to jerk off to that.

36:34.492 --> 36:36.884
Who jerks off to "Everlasting"?

36:37.654 --> 36:39.279
Who doesn't?

36:39.290 --> 36:40.428
I don't know.

36:40.439 --> 36:43.050
Are you really gonna be here every day?

36:43.061 --> 36:45.286
I mean, you already pitched
Serena to the network.

36:45.296 --> 36:48.122
You brought your girlfriend by
for opening night.

36:48.132 --> 36:50.324
Isn't your work here done?

36:50.334 --> 36:51.943
I'm just getting started.

36:51.954 --> 36:54.294
I'm serious about
this Emmy thing, Quinn.

36:54.305 --> 36:56.330
Oh, sure. That makes sense.

36:56.340 --> 36:58.600
This whole mid-life crisis thing.

36:58.611 --> 37:00.490
It's not a crisis, Quinnie.

37:00.501 --> 37:02.093
It's an awakening.

37:02.286 --> 37:05.779
Okay, but I mean, come on.

37:06.016 --> 37:07.282
Crystal?

37:09.690 --> 37:11.423
It's just easier, Quinn.

37:13.154 --> 37:14.420
She's easier.

37:35.542 --> 37:37.067
What is this?

37:37.078 --> 37:38.549
- Hey.
- Hey.

37:38.560 --> 37:40.618
Uh

37:40.629 --> 37:42.557
I know this is gonna sound pretentious,

37:42.568 --> 37:45.160
but my room is just too confining.

37:45.171 --> 37:48.401
You know, I'm used to sleeping
out under the stars,

37:48.412 --> 37:50.304
you know, fresh air.

37:50.315 --> 37:51.403
You should try it sometime.

37:51.414 --> 37:53.294
You know, I was actually
thinking about joining

37:53.305 --> 37:54.920
the Peace Corps for a while, too, there.

37:54.930 --> 37:56.288
- Oh, yeah?
- But then, you know,

37:56.298 --> 37:57.723
life got in the way or whatever.

37:57.733 --> 37:59.524
- So, but yeah.
- Yeah. Yeah, it does that.

37:59.534 --> 38:01.727
Anyway, where were you
thinking of going?

38:01.737 --> 38:03.295
I was thinking about Africa.

38:03.305 --> 38:05.930
Oh, man. I love Africa.

38:05.940 --> 38:07.799
- It's amazing, right?
- Yeah, it is.

38:07.809 --> 38:10.302
I mean, people talk about it,
but when you go there,

38:10.312 --> 38:11.970
it's just beyond your comprehension.

38:11.980 --> 38:14.038
- Rachel?
- So much...

38:14.048 --> 38:15.261
Hey.

38:15.667 --> 38:16.916
You got a second?

38:18.455 --> 38:20.222
- See ya.
- Yeah.

38:21.489 --> 38:22.691
Hey.

38:22.991 --> 38:25.583
Okay, just listen to me. I...
Look, I'm serious about the work

38:25.594 --> 38:27.317
that I've been doing on myself, Rachel.
I wouldn't...

38:27.328 --> 38:29.821
Will you stop? Honestly,
you are an insane person.

38:29.831 --> 38:31.489
I don't care about
what rehab you've done.

38:31.499 --> 38:33.223
Do you understand?

38:33.233 --> 38:35.593
Dude, you killed two people.

38:35.603 --> 38:36.615
Rachel.

38:36.626 --> 38:39.730
What? I mean, what were you thinking?
How do you even do that?

38:42.242 --> 38:43.742
Because you told me to.

38:45.579 --> 38:46.612
What?

38:49.082 --> 38:51.850
No way. No way. I was upset.

38:53.453 --> 38:54.744
I was venting to you.

38:54.754 --> 38:56.230
Come on, Rach. You know me.

38:56.241 --> 38:58.415
You knew that I'd do something.
You wanted me to.

38:58.425 --> 39:00.650
No. No.

39:00.660 --> 39:03.061
I did it to keep you
out of jail, Rachel.

39:05.465 --> 39:06.856
'Cause I still love you.

39:06.866 --> 39:08.866
DR. - Hey.

39:10.734 --> 39:11.890
Everything okay?

39:13.840 --> 39:15.965
Yeah. Everything's fine.

39:15.975 --> 39:17.241
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

39:19.612 --> 39:20.878
I'll see you, Rach.

39:23.015 --> 39:24.116
Yeah.

39:24.347 --> 39:28.049
Listen, um, I just want to
make sure you're all right.

39:30.132 --> 39:32.059
Really? Why do you even care, okay?

39:32.070 --> 39:33.570
You're not even here for me.

39:40.435 --> 39:41.935
Are you here for me?

39:46.011 --> 39:48.003
- Oh, my God.
- Okay, Ra...

40:03.588 --> 40:05.813
Ooh.

40:10.228 --> 40:11.819
So, how's she doing?

40:11.829 --> 40:14.095
She got really drunk on the first night,

40:14.106 --> 40:15.990
made out with a guy, and then cut him.

40:16.000 --> 40:19.167
Not the suitress... Quinn.

40:21.338 --> 40:23.163
I don't think she's got it anymore.

40:23.173 --> 40:25.307
- Oh, really.
- Unh-unh.

40:30.281 --> 40:33.107
So... do you want to jump to the part

40:33.117 --> 40:36.343
where she starts talking
about her dream wedding or...?

40:36.353 --> 40:37.878
No.

40:37.888 --> 40:39.346
Go back.

40:41.292 --> 40:42.535
Okay.

40:42.546 --> 40:44.418
I'm really, really good at my job,

40:44.428 --> 40:46.953
and I don't want to have to
apologize for that.

40:46.963 --> 40:48.629
Put that in.

40:49.621 --> 40:50.956
Are you sure?

40:50.966 --> 40:52.324
Absolutely.
