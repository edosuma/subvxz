00:02.085 --> 00:03.553
<i>My name is Oliver Queen.</i>

00:04.129 --> 00:05.506
<i>After five years in hell,</i>

00:05.672 --> 00:09.097
<i>I returned home with only one goal,
to save my city.</i>

00:09.259 --> 00:11.353
<i>Today I fight that war on two fronts.</i>

00:11.553 --> 00:14.102
<i>By day I lead Star City as its mayor.</i>

00:14.264 --> 00:15.732
<i>But by night I'm someone else.</i>

00:16.015 --> 00:18.189
<i>I am something else.</i>

00:18.393 --> 00:20.691
<i>I am the Green Arrow.</i>

00:20.854 --> 00:22.856
<i>Previously on</i> Arrow <i>and Flash...</i>

00:23.106 --> 00:26.701
You ran back in time, and then came back
and noticed that things were different?

00:26.860 --> 00:28.032
Who's that young boy with Digg?

00:28.195 --> 00:29.538
- He didn't have a kid before?
- Baby Sarah.

00:29.696 --> 00:30.948
Baby John.

00:32.783 --> 00:34.080
<i>WALKER". I used your gun.</i>

00:34.243 --> 00:35.790
<i>No one will ever believe your story.</i>

00:36.870 --> 00:38.292
Police never caught
your brother's shooter.

00:38.455 --> 00:39.456
You leave Andy out of this.

00:39.623 --> 00:41.341
<i>Floyd Lawton. He is the sniper.</i>

00:41.583 --> 00:43.085
I'll kill you for what you did to Andy.

00:43.293 --> 00:46.217
I have space for you right here,
right next to your brother.

00:47.422 --> 00:50.266
I can't do it alone. I need a team.

00:50.467 --> 00:52.720
<i>You're not just joining up
with the Green Arrow.</i>

00:52.928 --> 00:54.350
You'd be joining up with me.

00:54.513 --> 00:55.890
- I'm in.
- Me too.

01:07.651 --> 01:08.823
So, what're we looking at here?

01:08.986 --> 01:11.114
Carl Roberto.
Frequent flyer at Iron Heights.

01:11.280 --> 01:13.248
Seems like the only thing he's good at
is getting arrested.

01:13.490 --> 01:15.117
<i>He's not much of a challenge
for the Green Arrow.</i>

01:15.367 --> 01:16.539
He's not looking for a challenge.

01:16.702 --> 01:17.749
This is about teaching the four of you

01:17.911 --> 01:19.333
what happens out there
and how to handle it.

01:19.496 --> 01:20.622
Well, I'm up for any lesson

01:20.789 --> 01:22.462
that doesn't involve
him punching us in the face.

01:22.624 --> 01:24.797
Wait. He hits you guys?

01:29.840 --> 01:31.558
Oh, man, dude's gonna get it now.

01:39.182 --> 01:40.900
Always assume that the target's armed.

01:41.101 --> 01:42.523
Always assume that they're dangerous.

01:42.728 --> 01:44.025
Stardust.

01:45.022 --> 01:46.365
Who's "Stardust"?

01:46.523 --> 01:48.025
It's not a "who", it's a "what."

01:48.191 --> 01:51.661
Latest designer drug.
Makes PCP look like children's aspirin.

01:51.862 --> 01:53.705
I want your supplier.

01:53.864 --> 01:55.366
I can't, he'll kill me.

01:55.616 --> 01:57.539
What do you think I'm going to do?

01:59.286 --> 02:01.960
His interrogation technique
is a little unrefined.

02:02.497 --> 02:04.499
He's not going to kill him, is he?

02:04.708 --> 02:07.211
That's a terrific question.

02:07.419 --> 02:08.544
You're not gonna do it.

02:08.711 --> 02:10.965
Give me a name and I won't have to.

02:11.131 --> 02:14.726
Word's out on you, man.
You kill, but only when you have to.

02:18.055 --> 02:19.056
Son of a bitch!

02:19.222 --> 02:21.190
Oh, don't worry. You'll live.

02:21.892 --> 02:24.236
All right. All right!

02:25.062 --> 02:27.315
His name's Sampson. Derek Sampson.

02:27.481 --> 02:28.698
Where can I find him?

02:28.857 --> 02:31.076
I don't know. I pick up a package
on a different corner each night.

02:31.234 --> 02:32.907
- And never from him.
- Give me the package.

02:33.403 --> 02:35.497
The Stardust? Sure. It's in my pocket.

02:38.325 --> 02:39.497
Good idea.

02:39.701 --> 02:42.454
You really could use a high,
chill out a bit.

02:44.915 --> 02:46.758
Lam not gonna kill you.

02:47.459 --> 02:50.178
But I can't guarantee
you'll walk away from this.

02:59.221 --> 03:01.223
So, what did we learn?

03:01.390 --> 03:04.018
- Don't piss Oliver off.
- Like we needed that lesson.

03:04.184 --> 03:05.436
Information.

03:05.602 --> 03:07.104
Okay. It's the currency of our business.

03:07.270 --> 03:10.069
When Oliver gets back here,
he's gonna ask me to analyze the drugs,

03:10.232 --> 03:11.984
so we can find out
where it's being manufactured.

03:12.150 --> 03:13.447
I hate drugs.

03:13.610 --> 03:17.240
Not in a recreational sense. I have a life
like anyone else. It's just...

03:18.281 --> 03:20.579
I saw what all the gang violence
did to my hometown.

03:20.742 --> 03:21.743
Um...

03:22.119 --> 03:24.542
I'm gonna make DVDs
of tonight's surveillance footage.

03:24.705 --> 03:25.877
Oliver wants you to study them

03:26.039 --> 03:27.632
like a football player
would break down a game tape.

03:27.791 --> 03:29.088
And then he'll let us
get out on the field?

03:29.251 --> 03:30.252
I'm guessing not.

03:30.419 --> 03:32.342
That guy is seriously overestimating
my patience...

03:32.504 --> 03:33.551
I am.

03:33.755 --> 03:35.803
Because I didn't think that
you had any patience, Rene.

03:35.966 --> 03:36.967
Cute.

03:37.134 --> 03:39.512
Let's analyze this, see if we can
figure out where it's manufactured.

03:39.678 --> 03:43.524
Look, analysis and forensics is
cool and all, but that stuff takes time.

03:43.682 --> 03:46.151
I know the neighborhood where this dealer
is slinging out of.

03:46.309 --> 03:48.061
I think I can guess
where the Stardust is being made.

03:48.228 --> 03:50.902
Rene, we don't deal
in maybes and guesswork.

03:51.106 --> 03:53.950
Or maybe rich boy Mayor Queen
doesn't know the streets so good.

03:57.738 --> 03:59.240
Everyone get back to your training.

03:59.406 --> 04:02.751
You impress me in here, then maybe
I'll let you impress me out there.

04:04.453 --> 04:06.296
Text me when the analysis comes back.

04:08.123 --> 04:10.501
B and E in a shipping center,
on 8th and Amsterdam.

04:10.709 --> 04:12.461
Gunmen armed with an AR15.

04:24.389 --> 04:25.515
<i>L</i> give UP-.

04:26.141 --> 04:29.020
Detective Billy Malone.
Please don't shoot me.

04:29.186 --> 04:32.781
Sorry about the fake radio call,
but I didn't have your e-mail address

04:32.981 --> 04:34.198
and I thought we should meet.

04:35.650 --> 04:37.118
- Whoa. Okay.
- What do you want?

04:37.319 --> 04:39.993
<i>I discovered some intel
that I think concerns you.</i>

04:40.155 --> 04:42.749
I caught the Conahan murderer.
He was a member of Mayor Queen's...

04:42.908 --> 04:45.036
Anti-Crime Unit. Killed two weeks ago.

04:45.202 --> 04:47.751
By a guy who's somewhat promiscuous
with his choice of weapons.

04:47.996 --> 04:51.796
Apparently, he threatened someone else
you might be familiar with, Tobias Church.

04:51.958 --> 04:53.710
What was his problem with Church?

04:53.877 --> 04:57.427
According to the word on the street,
Church nearly killed you last week.

04:58.381 --> 05:00.600
Well, this guy
wants to do the job himself.

05:08.308 --> 05:09.480
Johnny“.

05:10.519 --> 05:12.988
- They tell you what happened?
- Just the charges.

05:13.146 --> 05:16.741
Espionage, murder, conduct unbecoming.

05:17.275 --> 05:20.575
I need you to tell me what happened.
And I need you to start at the beginning.

05:20.862 --> 05:23.741
<i>We were in Chechnya,
on an op to retrieve a trigger</i>

05:23.949 --> 05:25.622
<i>from one of Damien Darhk's nukes.</i>

05:25.826 --> 05:27.624
Turns out,
my C.O. had a better plan for it,

05:27.786 --> 05:29.584
<i>sell it to the highest bidder.</i>

05:30.121 --> 05:33.546
Something went sideways, Lyla.
The buyer didn't show. I don't know.

05:34.501 --> 05:35.502
I don't know.

05:36.670 --> 05:38.889
<i>I think pinning it on me
was the backup plan.</i>

05:39.047 --> 05:40.048
It's time.

05:40.590 --> 05:41.591
<i>You believe me, right?</i>

05:41.758 --> 05:43.180
<i>Johnny, how can you even ask that?</i>

05:43.385 --> 05:44.682
<i>Lyla, I love you.</i>

05:44.928 --> 05:47.898
Tell John Jr. I love him
and it'll be all right.

06:00.610 --> 06:03.830
Hey, get me out of here.
You can't leave me here with him.

06:05.156 --> 06:08.706
Hey, John.
Looks like we're cellmates again.

06:10.745 --> 06:11.997
Ain't that something?

06:20.297 --> 06:21.594
Your Honor, we need to talk.

06:21.756 --> 06:22.757
Where'd you go last night?

06:22.924 --> 06:25.143
I looked around the theater
after the movie and I couldn't find you.

06:25.302 --> 06:27.270
Mr. Mayor, we need to
take your security detail more seriously.

06:27.429 --> 06:30.524
I was serious when I said
that I didn't want a security detail.

06:30.682 --> 06:32.309
And look where that got me.

06:32.475 --> 06:33.692
Late for a meeting.

06:36.646 --> 06:39.525
What're you doing here?
You're not supposed to be here till 9:00.

06:39.691 --> 06:41.318
Our meeting was scheduled for 8:00.

06:41.610 --> 06:42.736
Exactly.

06:43.028 --> 06:45.201
What? Who's this?

06:45.488 --> 06:47.161
This is Susan Williams,

06:47.324 --> 06:50.328
and she's officially
my least favorite person on the planet.

06:50.535 --> 06:52.913
<i>It's not just that Oliver Queen's pick
for Deputy Mayor</i>

06:53.079 --> 06:55.252
<i>has a history of alcohol abuse.</i>

06:55.498 --> 06:57.751
<i>Recent reports confirm that Quentin Lance</i>

06:58.001 --> 07:00.345
<i>suffered a relapse right before
Mayor Queen appointed him.</i>

07:00.503 --> 07:03.302
I told you not to offer Quentin a job
in the administration

07:03.465 --> 07:05.684
and you decide to offer him Deputy Mayor?

07:05.842 --> 07:08.095
Okay, see, that's what
those five voicemails were about.

07:08.261 --> 07:09.638
The thing that I told you not to do.

07:09.804 --> 07:11.522
I listened to what you told me not to do,

07:11.681 --> 07:14.059
but then I decided to do
what I thought was right.

07:14.225 --> 07:16.819
Anyway, and guess who I got that one from?

07:16.978 --> 07:18.275
I'm an elected official.

07:18.438 --> 07:20.987
I have to answer to voters
and a free press.

07:21.316 --> 07:23.990
Unravel this, Speedy. Make it go away.

07:24.152 --> 07:26.871
That's gonna be a little hard to do
now that the story is already out there.

07:27.030 --> 07:31.331
I don't care.
You made this mess, you to clean it up.

07:36.206 --> 07:38.629
Some nights, I still feel the sea.

07:39.542 --> 07:41.340
Rocking, rocking. Oh.

07:41.586 --> 07:43.133
In that cage.

07:43.630 --> 07:46.804
- On that boat, <i>The Amazo,</i> you remember?
- Yeah.

07:46.967 --> 07:50.597
Then I wake up, I realize where I am.

07:50.845 --> 07:52.347
With family, with friends.

07:52.514 --> 07:56.269
You are only one who knows
what I went through. That nightmare...

07:56.893 --> 07:58.941
Here. I brought you something to drink.

07:59.145 --> 08:00.897
No. No, I can't.

08:01.064 --> 08:03.442
Not vodka. It's water.

08:06.236 --> 08:07.738
How you feel, my friend?

08:07.904 --> 08:08.996
Like I might have made a mistake.

08:09.155 --> 08:10.748
But what of Kovar?

08:11.533 --> 08:12.910
You still wish to kill him, no?

08:13.076 --> 08:15.249
I tell you before, Bratva only way.

08:15.578 --> 08:17.205
I think I'll take my chances.

08:17.372 --> 08:19.420
This is about other men being killed?

08:19.749 --> 08:21.751
That was first test. Two more left.

08:21.918 --> 08:23.420
What was the point of the test?

08:23.586 --> 08:25.088
To trust Bratva.

08:25.255 --> 08:28.555
Well, I'm sorry, Anatoly,
but I don't trust Bratva

08:28.717 --> 08:32.267
after I watched them
execute three innocent men.

08:32.721 --> 08:33.722
Ah!

08:34.639 --> 08:35.640
Mmm.

08:35.807 --> 08:37.433
There is miscommunication.

08:37.600 --> 08:39.602
You want to leave, leave.

08:40.020 --> 08:43.615
But come with me first.
I have something I need to show you.

08:49.029 --> 08:51.282
I cannot believe
I let you talk me into this.

08:51.448 --> 08:54.918
Yeah, I'm a little surprised, too.
But it's just recon.

08:55.285 --> 08:56.582
If this is just recon,

08:56.745 --> 08:59.123
then how come
we didn't bring along Rory and Curtis?

08:59.289 --> 09:01.291
'Cause Curtis would just tell
Mommy and Daddy.

09:01.458 --> 09:03.051
And Rory?

09:03.376 --> 09:04.969
Guy just weirds me out.

09:05.837 --> 09:06.838
Ready?

09:26.149 --> 09:29.153
Knew this'd be the place.
When's Queen gonna trust me?

09:29.319 --> 09:32.573
I'm sure it'll be right after he finds out
we went here without his permission.

09:32.739 --> 09:33.991
Night's still young.

09:34.157 --> 09:36.000
Bring the Green Arrow back
and bust this place up.

09:36.201 --> 09:40.206
You mean he will bust this place up.
He'll never let us get out in that field.

09:45.043 --> 09:47.137
It's easier to ask for forgiveness
than permission.

09:47.295 --> 09:50.094
You brought that?
What happened to this just being recon?

09:50.298 --> 09:51.720
We did the recon part.

11:20.638 --> 11:22.982
Mrs. Conahan,
this person will be apprehended.

11:23.224 --> 11:26.194
I have the Anti-Crime Unit
working overtime on this.

11:27.520 --> 11:30.444
Trust me,
we will get justice for your husband.

11:30.773 --> 11:32.195
Thought that was my job.

11:33.026 --> 11:34.198
Goodbye.

11:34.485 --> 11:36.237
I'm sorry, you are?

11:36.404 --> 11:38.077
Pissed. Royally. Off.

11:38.239 --> 11:39.286
I'm getting that.

11:39.449 --> 11:42.419
What I don't understand is who you are
and what you're doing in my office.

11:42.577 --> 11:44.375
Adrian Chase. Your new...

11:44.579 --> 11:46.832
District Attorney.
I'm sorry that we haven't met.

11:46.998 --> 11:49.467
I'm buried up to my eyeballs
in motion practice and indictments

11:49.667 --> 11:52.341
with a staff who's barely made it past
three rounds of budget cuts,

11:52.503 --> 11:54.926
so how about we save the pleasantries
for the next fundraiser

11:55.089 --> 11:57.763
- and get down to why I'm so...
- You're so pissed off?

11:57.926 --> 11:59.394
Royally. Remember Vertigo?

11:59.552 --> 12:01.429
Believe it or not,
I tried to buy some once.

12:01.596 --> 12:02.722
Yeah, I believe it.

12:02.889 --> 12:05.017
Well, what's hitting the street
is a million times worse.

12:05.183 --> 12:07.902
"Stardust." I'm not as out of touch
as most people think.

12:08.061 --> 12:09.688
But I do have some work to get done,
Mr. Chase.

12:09.854 --> 12:11.731
So why don't we get to the bottom of why
you're so pissed off.

12:11.898 --> 12:14.447
I've been building a case
against the dealer, Derek Sampson.

12:14.609 --> 12:17.203
I was going to flip him,
but last night, somebody killed him.

12:17.362 --> 12:19.456
- Rival dealer?
- A vigilante.

12:19.948 --> 12:21.370
That doesn't sound like the Green Arrow.

12:21.532 --> 12:24.706
Not him. Some idiot in a hockey mask.

12:26.829 --> 12:29.423
I'm sorry. Did you say hockey mask?

12:31.793 --> 12:32.840
Everything okay, boss?

12:33.002 --> 12:35.505
A Stardust dealer was killed last night
by a vigilante!

12:35.672 --> 12:36.673
Lots running around the city...

12:36.839 --> 12:38.682
- Wearing a hockey mask.
- Hey, short fry was there too.

12:38.841 --> 12:39.933
Thanks, Rene.

12:40.093 --> 12:41.686
Rory and I didn't, though!
Just for the record.

12:41.886 --> 12:44.765
Okay, I ain't gonna deny I was there,
but neither were you, man.

12:45.014 --> 12:47.517
This guy was all sorts of nutso, loco.
It was either him or me.

12:47.684 --> 12:50.437
You never should have been
in that position.

12:50.603 --> 12:52.105
So, you're saying,
this city isn't better off

12:52.272 --> 12:54.570
with one less dealer on the streets?
Have you told the mayor that?

12:54.732 --> 12:57.986
You have no ability to think big picture.

12:58.152 --> 12:59.779
Stardust is still out there.

12:59.988 --> 13:02.457
The DA's office had a plan,
they were going to flip Sampson,

13:02.657 --> 13:04.534
and then he was gonna give up
the suppliers.

13:04.867 --> 13:06.619
They can't do that anymore.

13:06.786 --> 13:09.209
How about you put an arrow in my other leg
and we'll call it even?

13:11.499 --> 13:14.218
Last week, you said
you needed to be able to trust me.

13:14.752 --> 13:17.926
Fine.
Well, I need to be able to trust you.

13:18.715 --> 13:22.720
If I can't,
then why am I wasting my time with you?

13:29.684 --> 13:31.027
Never in my entire life,

13:31.185 --> 13:35.065
did I think that I was gonna meet somebody
more stubborn than him.

13:35.231 --> 13:36.824
I would've lost that bet.

13:40.695 --> 13:43.699
Is this normal behavior around here?

13:44.115 --> 13:45.617
More than I'd like to admit.

13:55.251 --> 13:57.845
Sorry, my friend's visiting
from Marseille.

13:58.004 --> 13:59.347
No problem, Miss Williams.

13:59.505 --> 14:01.849
I really appreciate you taking the time
to meet with me.

14:02.216 --> 14:03.638
Anything for a fan.

14:04.218 --> 14:07.062
I'm assuming you watched
the other night's broadcast.

14:07.221 --> 14:09.269
Yes, actually, I...

14:09.432 --> 14:12.151
I really appreciated
all the wonderful things you were saying

14:12.310 --> 14:13.732
about my brother's administration.

14:13.895 --> 14:14.896
Uh...

14:15.063 --> 14:16.485
- Can you give us a minute?
- Mmm-hmm.

14:18.441 --> 14:21.115
You're right. I was out of line.

14:21.319 --> 14:23.617
My producer,
he's always pushing me to be "edgy,"

14:23.780 --> 14:26.408
to do stories
that'll generate Internet traffic.

14:26.574 --> 14:27.791
Sometimes I push too far.

14:27.950 --> 14:30.123
Well, thank you.

14:30.286 --> 14:31.959
I really appreciate that.

14:32.163 --> 14:34.461
Of course.
I mean, we're coworkers, in a way.

14:34.624 --> 14:38.219
Um, "co-worker to co-worker,"
I was hoping you'd do me a favor.

14:38.920 --> 14:41.469
I need you to walk back your story.

14:41.756 --> 14:45.681
The truth is, Oliver hasn't appointed
Quentin Lance, Deputy Mayor yet.

14:45.843 --> 14:47.971
- That's not what my sources tell me.
- Well, they're wrong.

14:48.137 --> 14:49.309
Because honestly,

14:49.472 --> 14:51.895
my brother doesn't even know
that I offered him the job.

14:54.268 --> 14:56.521
- Well, that certainly changes things.
- Yeah.

14:56.729 --> 14:58.731
- I'll update the story.
- Really?

14:58.981 --> 15:00.324
Co-workers, right?

15:05.655 --> 15:07.532
How the hell are you alive?

15:07.698 --> 15:09.996
Great question. But you know the answer.

15:11.494 --> 15:13.167
They never found your body.

15:13.329 --> 15:14.706
A hell of a world we live in, ain't it?

15:15.331 --> 15:17.834
I survive a freaking building
exploding under me

15:18.000 --> 15:20.002
only to get pinched a couple months later.

15:20.336 --> 15:22.964
And it is hard going on the lam
with an eye-patch.

15:23.965 --> 15:25.512
What's your excuse for being here?

15:29.303 --> 15:30.850
I re-enlisted back into the Army.

15:32.265 --> 15:33.812
Didn't go good.

15:34.976 --> 15:38.651
Can't really picture you ever giving up
your day job as a superhero.

15:38.855 --> 15:40.823
- I just couldn't do it anymore.
- Why's that?

15:41.065 --> 15:43.534
I'm not here
to play 20 questions with you, Lawton.

15:43.734 --> 15:45.077
All right.

15:46.737 --> 15:48.535
How about we play cards?

15:55.163 --> 15:56.915
Deceased male. Late twenties.

15:57.123 --> 15:59.467
Six feet two inches, 214 pounds.

15:59.667 --> 16:02.045
Found in a body of unknown chemicals.

16:02.670 --> 16:06.391
Based on the lack of epidermis erosion,
the chemicals were non-acidic.

16:08.134 --> 16:11.559
Autopsy was commenced at 18:25
with a Y-incision.

16:23.149 --> 16:24.742
Why can't I feel anything?

16:34.285 --> 16:35.912
Good night. I'm headed home.

16:36.746 --> 16:37.918
Give me a sec, I'll join you.

16:38.080 --> 16:39.923
Not home, I mean.

16:40.708 --> 16:44.429
Bow! I'm a happily married man. Happy.

16:44.587 --> 16:46.055
I meant join you out.

16:46.255 --> 16:48.553
I figured. Besides, you're not my type.

16:48.716 --> 16:50.263
- Are you gay?
- No.

16:50.426 --> 16:52.349
Which makes you not my type.

16:52.762 --> 16:54.639
Of course, yeah, I was...

16:54.805 --> 16:57.729
Yeah, speaking of which, uh,
you were talking about home.

16:57.892 --> 16:59.940
Hometown, are you not from Star City?

17:00.144 --> 17:02.363
No. Havenrock.

17:02.855 --> 17:04.573
Havenrock.

17:06.983 --> 17:10.079
You know, I just realized that I...

17:10.238 --> 17:12.115
I remembered, that I...

17:12.281 --> 17:17.287
Oh, yeah, I promised Felicity
I would help her with some things.

17:17.537 --> 17:19.960
- Yeah. No problem. Good night.
- Night.

17:20.122 --> 17:21.419
Good night, Felicity.

17:21.790 --> 17:22.791
Night.

17:30.216 --> 17:31.308
Yes?

17:31.592 --> 17:33.310
You knew, didn't you?

17:34.136 --> 17:35.683
About Havenrock?

17:35.846 --> 17:37.348
He told Oliver. I overheard.

17:37.557 --> 17:40.026
Does he know? Rory, I mean.

17:40.309 --> 17:43.108
Know that I destroyed his hometown
with a nuclear missile five months ago?

17:43.271 --> 17:45.524
No. It hasn't come up.

17:45.731 --> 17:50.157
You didn't destroy anything, Felicity.
That was Damien Darhk.

17:50.361 --> 17:54.161
Darhk sent the missile to Monument Point.

17:55.241 --> 17:57.869
I sent the missile to Havenrock.

17:59.996 --> 18:01.998
I killed tens of thousands of people.

18:02.248 --> 18:03.795
To save millions.

18:04.166 --> 18:06.260
Tell that to Rory's family.

18:07.837 --> 18:09.589
What is that?

18:11.340 --> 18:12.967
911, from Starling General.

18:13.509 --> 18:15.887
Where the hell are the cops?
We need backup!

18:20.308 --> 18:21.400
Get out of here.

18:22.852 --> 18:26.857
Derek Sampson, you have failed this city.

19:08.522 --> 19:10.945
Hey, Rory, thanks for coming back.
Oliver should be here any second.

19:11.108 --> 19:14.237
- What happened?
- Well, first meta-humans. Then magic.

19:14.445 --> 19:16.072
And now you can add into the mix, zombies.

19:16.238 --> 19:19.617
The guy that Rene killed
is kind of still walking around.

19:19.825 --> 19:21.077
Sampson is not a zombie.

19:21.494 --> 19:23.121
According to the coroner's
toxicology workup,

19:23.329 --> 19:25.081
<i>Sampson's body was infused
with a mixture of chemicals</i>

19:25.247 --> 19:27.545
that must have put his body into a state
that fooled the paramedics.

19:27.708 --> 19:28.925
It was a matter of time before he woke up.

19:29.085 --> 19:30.211
And kicked Oliver's ass.

19:30.378 --> 19:31.800
He didn't kick Oliver's ass.

19:32.004 --> 19:33.256
And can we please not say things like that

19:33.422 --> 19:35.220
when Oliver could enter in,
like, any second.

19:36.175 --> 19:37.267
Like, now, see?

19:37.426 --> 19:39.770
We need to find this guy
before he hurts anyone else.

19:39.929 --> 19:42.102
I'm tapped into all satellites
and CC feeds.

19:42.264 --> 19:43.891
What happened?

19:44.058 --> 19:48.234
Physiology changed. Enhanced strength.
And I don't think he can feel pain.

19:48.437 --> 19:51.441
Felicity thinks it's from exposure
to whatever chemicals were in the vat

19:51.607 --> 19:52.733
<i>that Rene dumped him into.</i>

19:52.900 --> 19:54.902
- Any way to reverse it?
- I could run some tests.

19:55.111 --> 19:56.784
But it would take time
and I'd rather keep my eye on the

19:56.946 --> 19:58.493
"find Sampson
before he hurts anyone else" ball.

19:58.656 --> 20:00.624
Well, good thing
I was a biochemistry major in college.

20:00.783 --> 20:01.784
I'll get on it.

20:04.495 --> 20:07.248
Text me as soon as you have anything.
We can't let the cops get to him first.

20:07.415 --> 20:08.792
I want to help too.

20:09.709 --> 20:10.961
I think you've done enough.

20:11.127 --> 20:14.051
I'm sorry about before. But I get it now.
I'll do whatever you need.

20:14.213 --> 20:16.966
What I need is to trust
that when I do ask for your help,

20:17.133 --> 20:19.135
you're not, immediately, gonna
make the problem worse.

20:19.677 --> 20:22.305
He said he was sorry. Let us help.

20:22.513 --> 20:24.436
Yeah. We could canvas the city.

20:24.640 --> 20:27.644
After what happened the last time
you went out looking for Sampson? Pass.

21:19.195 --> 21:20.697
The recruit was a murderer?

21:20.905 --> 21:22.953
Yeah. Police catch him

21:23.115 --> 21:25.368
but he is son to friend of Kovar,
so he goes free.

21:26.368 --> 21:28.120
Bratva step in to bring justice.

21:28.287 --> 21:30.710
How is recruiting him
into the Bratva justice?

21:30.873 --> 21:33.046
But he was not recruited, was he?

21:33.209 --> 21:35.883
What if I wasn't the one
to ring the bell, Anatoly?

21:36.045 --> 21:37.638
We still bring justice.

21:37.797 --> 21:40.095
If you're trying to convince me
to trust the Bratva,

21:40.257 --> 21:41.509
you're not doing a very good job.

21:41.675 --> 21:44.053
You must trust process.

21:44.220 --> 21:46.268
Not everything what it seems.

21:46.472 --> 21:50.852
To defeat Kovar, you need army.
Bratva army.

21:52.728 --> 21:55.732
You come this far. Why give up now?

22:02.238 --> 22:06.288
Six of hearts?
Come on, six of hearts, where are you?

22:06.575 --> 22:07.952
My kingdom for a six of hearts.

22:08.118 --> 22:10.871
Will you shut up for five minutes
and I won't have to kill you?

22:11.080 --> 22:12.502
Whoo! There's that temper.

22:12.665 --> 22:16.169
Good thing your kid won't have to grow up
with it like your brother did, huh?

22:16.377 --> 22:18.095
What'd you say to me?

22:18.254 --> 22:19.927
How's all that going, anyway?

22:20.130 --> 22:22.929
You ever find that group
that paid me to off him?

22:23.092 --> 22:24.264
They didn't.

22:24.426 --> 22:25.769
What's that now?

22:26.804 --> 22:28.431
They didn't want him dead.

22:29.932 --> 22:31.229
He was alive.

22:32.268 --> 22:34.942
Like I said, hell of a world, ain't it?
I mean...

22:36.272 --> 22:39.242
Wait, why did you say was alive, just now?

22:39.900 --> 22:40.901
<i>Huh?</i>

22:41.735 --> 22:43.783
Hello? John? Anybody home?

22:43.946 --> 22:45.744
Because I killed him.

22:49.785 --> 22:53.665
So all that hate that you poured into me
for killing your brother,

22:54.206 --> 22:56.959
you really should've been
pouring into yourself.

23:03.757 --> 23:05.885
I was just on my way to see you.
What can I help you with?

23:06.051 --> 23:08.179
SCPD's working on locating Sampson.

23:08.387 --> 23:10.640
I want to start with a search
of his last known address,

23:10.806 --> 23:12.649
but Judge Pittson
won't sign the search warrant

23:12.808 --> 23:14.435
for Sampson's prior residence.

23:14.602 --> 23:16.070
I helped get Pittson elected.

23:16.228 --> 23:18.606
Which is why I'm talking to you.
Could you lean on her?

23:18.814 --> 23:21.442
- Absolutely. All hands on deck.
- Thank you.

23:22.151 --> 23:23.949
Hey, you, uh...
You probably don't remember this,

23:24.111 --> 23:25.829
but we actually met 12 years ago.

23:26.030 --> 23:27.828
You tried to pick up my girlfriend.

23:29.408 --> 23:32.082
I did a lot of things back then
that I'm not especially proud of,

23:32.286 --> 23:34.664
but I'm sure she ended up
with the better man.

23:34.872 --> 23:36.294
Hell, no. She went home with you.

23:38.167 --> 23:39.510
It's okay. I don't hold grudges.

23:40.586 --> 23:42.179
Looks like your Chief of Staff
needs a minute.

23:42.338 --> 23:44.181
Let me know when you talk to Pittson.
I appreciate it.

23:44.340 --> 23:45.432
Of course.

23:49.303 --> 23:51.351
How'd it go with that reporter?

23:51.555 --> 23:53.478
Well, I thought it went well.

23:53.641 --> 23:54.688
Thought?

23:57.186 --> 24:00.360
<i>Unfortunately, Mayor Queen
doesn't seem to have the first clue</i>

24:00.522 --> 24:02.149
<i>of what's going on
within his own administration.</i>

24:02.316 --> 24:03.693
<i>For those of you who may recall...</i>

24:03.901 --> 24:05.824
- I'm so sorry.
- What did you say to this woman?

24:05.986 --> 24:07.203
That“

24:07.363 --> 24:08.535
That part's coming next.

24:08.697 --> 24:10.699
<i>...chosen
may be too strong of a word.</i>

24:10.866 --> 24:13.619
<i>Not only was a disgraced public official
re-hired by the city,</i>

24:13.786 --> 24:17.416
in an <i>even higher position,
but Mayor Queen wasn't</i> even <i>aware of it.</i>

24:17.873 --> 24:19.716
<i>The decision was made by his sister.</i>

24:21.126 --> 24:23.254
Okay, look,
I am going to issue a statement

24:23.420 --> 24:25.548
taking full responsibility for this, okay?

24:25.714 --> 24:29.218
And, then I am going to offer you
my letter of resignation.

24:29.468 --> 24:30.640
- Thea, that...
- No, Ollie, look,

24:30.844 --> 24:34.223
you said it yourself.
I made this mess.

24:34.890 --> 24:36.437
I'm gonna go clean it up.

24:42.690 --> 24:45.489
You know, it's only a matter of time
before Rory figures it out.

24:45.693 --> 24:46.740
What?

24:46.902 --> 24:48.245
The "you and Havenrock" connection.

24:48.404 --> 24:50.702
I mean, you can't seem to be around
the guy for more than two minutes

24:50.864 --> 24:52.787
without acting widgy.
And sooner or later, he's gonna ask why.

24:52.992 --> 24:54.915
Well, I will take the "later." Thank you.

24:55.077 --> 24:56.454
Have you talked this out with Oliver?

24:57.037 --> 24:59.631
No. Oliver and I don't have
that type of relationship anymore.

24:59.832 --> 25:01.584
And you're right. I am acting "widgy."

25:01.750 --> 25:02.922
Because having him on the team

25:03.085 --> 25:04.758
is like having a constant reminder
about what I did.

25:04.920 --> 25:06.263
So clear the air.

25:06.422 --> 25:08.550
Look, if the past four years
have taught you anything,

25:08.716 --> 25:11.014
it should be that keeping secrets
never works out.

25:11.176 --> 25:12.223
I hardly even know Rory.

25:12.386 --> 25:13.683
And what I do know about him

25:13.846 --> 25:15.348
is that he has
several-thousand-year-old rags

25:15.514 --> 25:16.766
that he can mystically use to strangle me.

25:16.932 --> 25:18.525
He must be great at parties.

25:18.934 --> 25:22.529
Look, I think that you need to just
trust the fact that he will not kill you.

25:22.688 --> 25:25.532
And trust that he may be able
to see things clearer than you do

25:25.691 --> 25:27.489
and know that this wasn't your fault.

25:31.905 --> 25:34.875
Whoever called this meeting,
you best step up.

25:35.367 --> 25:37.870
The text I got came from Sampson's cell.

25:38.203 --> 25:40.126
Sampson is dead.

25:40.372 --> 25:42.625
What'd Mark Twain say?

25:43.333 --> 25:48.635
"Reports of my death
have been greatly exaggerated."

25:49.006 --> 25:51.008
Man, he wasn't kidding.

25:51.759 --> 25:55.980
Righteous. So we're back in business?

25:56.221 --> 26:00.067
Stardust? No. I'm thinking bigger.

26:00.309 --> 26:02.528
You go bigger,
you draw attention from Tobias Church.

26:02.686 --> 26:06.441
I'm not afraid of Church no more.
He should be afraid of me.

26:09.526 --> 26:12.871
Ever see Lethal Weapon? My favorite scene.

26:14.323 --> 26:17.827
Gary Busey, man. That guy, he could act.

26:22.498 --> 26:25.547
If you can't feel pain,
you can't be stopped.

26:26.043 --> 26:27.841
So we all get this treatment

26:28.003 --> 26:31.007
and we take back this city
from Tobias Church.

26:44.853 --> 26:46.981
I didn't know you were still here.

26:47.731 --> 26:48.732
<i>Oh!</i>

26:49.274 --> 26:50.617
That looks painful.

26:51.360 --> 26:53.033
It's par for the course.

26:53.779 --> 26:55.952
How'd things go at City Hall?

26:56.365 --> 26:58.493
- Oh. That bad, huh?
- Channel 52.

27:02.204 --> 27:05.208
<i>Unfortunately, Mayor Queen
doesn't seem to have the first clue</i>

27:05.415 --> 27:07.338
<i>of what's going on
within his own administration...</i>

27:07.543 --> 27:08.965
I already don't like her.

27:10.379 --> 27:15.101
I can't keep my people in line.
As mayor or as Green Arrow.

27:15.801 --> 27:18.395
"Heavy is the head that wears the crown."

27:18.887 --> 27:20.389
Shakespeare. Or Tupac.

27:21.265 --> 27:24.064
So this is Green Arrow brooding
or Mayor brooding?

27:24.226 --> 27:26.399
What's happening with Susan Williams
is just politics.

27:26.562 --> 27:29.111
Arrow brooding. That's excellent.
'Cause I have more experience with that.

27:29.273 --> 27:31.947
Rene didn't listen to what I said.

27:32.734 --> 27:34.452
And he created a superhuman.

27:35.946 --> 27:37.493
Well, I used to have a dog.

27:38.240 --> 27:42.541
Lucky. Adorable, but peed on everything.

27:42.870 --> 27:45.248
A trainer told me that
next time it happened,

27:45.455 --> 27:49.085
that I should roll up a piece of newspaper
and smack myself on the head.

27:49.251 --> 27:53.006
Because it was my fault.
Lucky was just doing as dogs do.

27:53.172 --> 27:55.675
You're pushing this "Wild Dog" codename
thing a bit too far.

27:55.883 --> 27:59.433
My point is, when you're in charge
everything your team does is on you.

27:59.636 --> 28:00.762
Even what Rene did?

28:00.971 --> 28:03.065
He was right about being able to locate
Sampson's operation.

28:03.223 --> 28:04.941
If you listened to him
instead of shutting him down...

28:05.100 --> 28:06.647
Right, then none of this
would've happened.

28:06.810 --> 28:08.437
And we both know why you shut him down.

28:11.106 --> 28:12.278
Because I don't trust him.

28:12.482 --> 28:15.736
Like you said, if you don't...
If you won't,

28:15.986 --> 28:17.329
why are you wasting your time?

28:20.115 --> 28:21.162
What's that?

28:21.366 --> 28:24.210
I'm running an algorithm,
pings in case anything unusual happens.

28:24.369 --> 28:26.463
"Unusual"?
That's casting a pretty wide net.

28:26.622 --> 28:28.624
Well, all my other nets
are coming up empty.

28:28.790 --> 28:30.087
<i>Break-in at Allman Industrial.</i>

28:30.292 --> 28:31.339
That <i>could be</i> anyone.

28:31.501 --> 28:32.627
Well, do you know anyone besides Sampson

28:32.794 --> 28:33.966
who could get shot by security guards

28:34.129 --> 28:35.130
and just shrug off the bullets?

28:35.297 --> 28:36.469
What'd he steal?

28:36.632 --> 28:38.509
Don't know. This is gonna take
a lot of time and typing.

28:38.717 --> 28:40.560
Their warehouse
is the size of three football fields.

28:40.719 --> 28:42.517
- Let me know what you find out.
- Okay.

28:42.679 --> 28:44.101
Wait, wait. Where are you going?

28:44.264 --> 28:45.982
To get the team.

28:50.479 --> 28:52.277
I ran Walker through every database.

28:52.481 --> 28:56.111
Initially he came up clean, but
there are some financial irregularities.

28:56.318 --> 28:57.570
I want you to stop.

28:58.612 --> 28:59.829
What?

29:00.614 --> 29:04.494
Stop digging.
I'm not gonna fight these charges.

29:04.993 --> 29:06.336
Johnny, that's insane!

29:06.495 --> 29:09.590
Actually, it's the first thing
that's made sense to me in a long while.

29:10.749 --> 29:13.878
- Ever since I killed Andy...
- You think you need to be punished.

29:14.044 --> 29:15.591
<i>I</i> know <i>I</i> do.

29:20.133 --> 29:21.476
Lyla.

29:22.844 --> 29:27.566
I didn't have to pull that trigger,
but I did.

29:30.435 --> 29:31.687
Something's wrong with me, baby.

29:31.853 --> 29:36.154
Then let me help you.
We will figure this out together.

29:36.316 --> 29:38.034
When I thought Lawton killed Andy,

29:38.193 --> 29:41.367
all I wanted to do
was bring his murderer to justice.

29:43.907 --> 29:45.033
I still do.

29:45.200 --> 29:47.419
Floyd Lawton was an assassin for hire.

29:47.995 --> 29:51.465
You're a good man. And you're alive.

29:51.665 --> 29:53.383
Floyd Lawton is long dead.

29:53.542 --> 29:55.840
No, Lyla, he's not. He's...

29:59.506 --> 30:00.723
Johnny?

30:02.217 --> 30:03.685
Johnny?

30:06.430 --> 30:08.228
Stop fighting for me, Lyla.

30:11.018 --> 30:12.190
I have.

30:24.197 --> 30:25.744
You ain't gonna get me this time.

30:25.907 --> 30:28.126
I've won eight in a row.

30:28.452 --> 30:30.079
Are you sure you were an Olympian?

30:30.245 --> 30:34.000
Having quick reflexes is not
the only quality in an Olympian. Okay?

30:34.166 --> 30:37.090
There are other things.
Like determination. And stubbornness.

30:37.252 --> 30:39.050
I guess a sense of fashion
isn't one of them.

30:39.546 --> 30:41.014
Come on, man,
where did you get that jacket?

30:41.590 --> 30:43.137
It's retro in all the wrong ways.

30:43.342 --> 30:46.346
Wait, you don't know "Fair Play",
Terry Sloane?

30:47.846 --> 30:50.440
Terry Sloane, Mr. Terrific?

30:50.766 --> 30:53.440
The greatest wrestler
in the history of wrestling.

30:53.602 --> 30:55.479
He was so good that he wore an outfit

30:55.645 --> 30:57.113
with the words "Fair Play"
written across it.

30:57.272 --> 31:00.196
Like I'm so good
I don't even need to cheat to beat you.

31:00.400 --> 31:01.743
He was kind of my idol.

31:01.943 --> 31:03.490
Did you have a little crush on him too?

31:03.695 --> 31:05.789
Hey, that's beside the point.

31:11.119 --> 31:14.669
- Something on your mind, boss?
- You've a good natural form.

31:14.873 --> 31:17.547
'Cause it's not natural.
I've been working on it for years.

31:17.793 --> 31:20.296
Rene, if I've been too hard on you,
it's because I want to make sure

31:20.462 --> 31:21.964
you're taking this as seriously as I am.

31:22.130 --> 31:24.098
Wouldn't be here
if I wasn't taking it seriously.

31:24.257 --> 31:26.305
You were right about Sampson's operation.

31:27.469 --> 31:31.599
You've have a knack for this
and I should've trusted you.

31:32.432 --> 31:33.433
Whoa.

31:33.892 --> 31:36.361
- That almost sounded like an apology.
- I'm still learning, too.

31:36.520 --> 31:38.989
All right, well, before you guys
hug it out, you should really see this.

31:39.147 --> 31:40.990
Found out what Sampson stole
from Allman Industrial.

31:41.149 --> 31:43.823
- A molecular transmodality processor.
- What?

31:43.985 --> 31:46.659
It replicates chemicals
based on their molecular structure.

31:46.822 --> 31:48.199
What would Sampson need with that?

31:48.365 --> 31:50.993
- The vat you dropped him in...
- It was full of Stardust.

31:51.159 --> 31:52.957
But when we were fighting, a pipe burst

31:53.120 --> 31:54.667
and some liquid drained from it
into the vat.

31:54.830 --> 31:58.130
Sounds like you stumbled on the recipe
for making a superhuman killing machine.

31:58.291 --> 32:00.009
And now he's gonna use the...

32:00.210 --> 32:02.429
- Molecular transmodality processor.
- To make more of them.

32:02.671 --> 32:06.221
And he'll need the original mixture,
which means that he'll return to... Oh!

32:06.591 --> 32:09.720
I've always wanted to say this,
"The scene of the crime."

32:12.013 --> 32:15.358
If Sampson is building an army
then I'm going to need mine.

32:15.517 --> 32:17.690
- For real?
- For real.

32:21.690 --> 32:23.033
Suit up! Oh.

32:23.775 --> 32:25.994
I thought we were all going, like,
it was going to be a nice moment

32:26.153 --> 32:27.325
where we all said it the same time.

32:27.487 --> 32:29.910
Is that just your thing?
That's you, only? Okay, yeah.

32:30.073 --> 32:32.371
That's you, that's just him,
for the record, for everybody.

32:38.874 --> 32:40.717
<i>This area's closed off, pal. Crime scene.</i>

32:40.959 --> 32:42.336
Yeah. I know.

32:56.391 --> 32:57.734
Move in.

33:11.448 --> 33:13.496
Y'all gonna be fearless.

33:14.075 --> 33:15.372
Painless.

33:16.036 --> 33:18.255
Unstoppable.

33:38.141 --> 33:39.233
Let's do this.

33:41.353 --> 33:42.775
In position. Ten seconds.

33:42.938 --> 33:45.361
Make sure to activate the pressure sensor
before the detonation.

33:45.565 --> 33:48.068
So the spark ignites the entirety
of the pipeline, yeah, I know.

33:48.276 --> 33:49.653
Now let me concentrate.

33:56.284 --> 33:58.707
Why're you smiling, dirtbag?

34:18.014 --> 34:20.187
You are a freaky kind of scary.

34:20.391 --> 34:23.487
It's the whispers, right?
It just does that. I have no idea how.

34:23.687 --> 34:25.155
New mask looks cool, by the way.

34:25.355 --> 34:28.484
Well, thank you. Actually,
still feels a little weird on my face.

34:40.829 --> 34:43.206
I think you dropped this, Mr. Fair Play.

34:44.248 --> 34:46.467
Thank you. Okay.

35:01.558 --> 35:04.858
Thought we've been over this.
You can't hurt me.

35:14.696 --> 35:17.700
Just because you can't feel your tendons
being sliced,

35:17.866 --> 35:19.584
doesn't mean you don't need them.

35:22.454 --> 35:25.048
Too bad my guys still have you surrounded.

35:25.248 --> 35:28.548
No. I trust that
my guys took care of them.

35:28.752 --> 35:31.346
Okay, Curtis. Kaboom time.

35:57.030 --> 35:58.657
Where exactly are we going?

35:58.907 --> 36:02.207
Did the people who built this elevator
know your secret, too?

36:02.577 --> 36:04.420
You know, I've been meaning to ask.

36:04.621 --> 36:06.999
What kind of vigilante
wears a hockey mask?

36:07.332 --> 36:08.834
I think it's cool.

36:10.585 --> 36:13.555
Okay, everyone, uh,
just breathe normally.

36:13.755 --> 36:15.883
I know it's a lot to take in, so...

36:16.091 --> 36:17.308
He fainted the first time he saw it.

36:17.550 --> 36:20.349
I had the flu. I had the flu, ya'll.

36:21.262 --> 36:25.062
So this is the cave... I like to call it
the Arrow Cave. It's Oliver-esque.

36:45.328 --> 36:48.673
Bratva. Do you know what this word means?

36:50.291 --> 36:51.918
Brotherhood.

36:52.127 --> 36:54.175
If you are hungry,
brothers will feed you.

36:54.462 --> 36:59.093
If you are hurt, brothers
bring 10 times pain to men responsible.

36:59.634 --> 37:03.264
If one brother succeeds,
all brothers are rich.

37:03.638 --> 37:08.314
If one brother fails, all brothers suffer.

37:08.810 --> 37:11.689
Your brothers would kill for you,
would die for you.

37:12.021 --> 37:15.696
As you would kill and die for them.

37:19.821 --> 37:21.573
If these men
are supposed to be my brothers,

37:21.740 --> 37:22.787
Why would I fight them?

37:22.949 --> 37:24.417
These men are not here to fight you.

37:24.617 --> 37:26.540
Most of these men in this room
have tried to kill me.

37:26.703 --> 37:28.330
And with these knives, they could.

37:28.496 --> 37:31.500
<i>But, you must trust they will not.</i>

37:35.920 --> 37:37.388
Do you trust your brothers?

37:39.716 --> 37:41.059
I trust my brothers.

37:41.301 --> 37:42.644
Take off jacket, turn around.

38:13.374 --> 38:15.968
Sorry. I keep on seeming
to interrupt you two.

38:16.169 --> 38:19.389
Don't be. I was just telling the Mayor
that Derek Sampson was apprehended.

38:19.631 --> 38:21.304
- By the SCPD?
- No.

38:21.633 --> 38:24.762
Based on forensics, the Green Arrow
is either as fast as The Flash

38:24.928 --> 38:27.602
or he's got a new team behind him.

38:27.764 --> 38:29.391
This city never seems
to get easier, does it?

38:33.061 --> 38:37.783
Well, as promised, I will stay on

38:37.982 --> 38:42.738
until you can find a more qualified
and experienced replacement.

38:42.904 --> 38:46.078
I don't want experience.
I want someone that I can trust, Speedy,

38:46.282 --> 38:47.579
and that person is you.

38:47.784 --> 38:50.458
I messed up, Ollie. Big time.

38:54.958 --> 38:57.586
No, Thea. You didn't. Follow me.

38:59.587 --> 39:01.965
Thank you all for coming.

39:02.966 --> 39:05.640
I would like to address, head-on
and with brutal honesty,

39:05.802 --> 39:08.772
some of the recent reports
regarding my administration.

39:08.972 --> 39:12.101
Reports that suggest
that while the voters may have elected me,

39:12.308 --> 39:14.527
others have been making decisions
in my stead.

39:14.769 --> 39:18.273
The truth of the matter is
that every decision

39:18.523 --> 39:21.868
made by any member of my administration,
is my decision.

39:22.026 --> 39:25.326
The buck, as they say, stops with me.

39:25.655 --> 39:29.956
<i>Because when you're in charge,
everything that your team does is on you.</i>

39:30.118 --> 39:32.462
<i>And I trust my team.</i>

39:33.621 --> 39:34.964
That team

39:35.373 --> 39:38.377
will include former Police Captain,
Quentin Lance.

39:38.585 --> 39:41.008
Who'll be serving beside me
as Deputy Mayor.

39:43.047 --> 39:45.800
Appreciate the vote of confidence,
Mr. Mayor.

39:45.967 --> 39:48.345
You're the right man for the job.
Trust me.

39:54.142 --> 39:56.144
Susan. A word?

39:57.020 --> 40:00.024
Thea, I'm so sorry.

40:00.189 --> 40:01.406
You must think
I'm the worst kind of person.

40:01.566 --> 40:03.534
No, I actually already know that's true.

40:04.152 --> 40:05.950
Thea, let me...

40:06.154 --> 40:07.997
Explain? Lie?

40:08.156 --> 40:10.830
No, I'm just gonna
save us both the trouble.

40:11.034 --> 40:12.911
I already know exactly what happened.

40:14.162 --> 40:15.960
You played me.

40:16.456 --> 40:18.333
You only get to do that once.

40:18.833 --> 40:21.086
And the next time
you try to cross me like that,

40:21.544 --> 40:24.047
you'll be lucky if you even have a blog.

40:32.805 --> 40:34.523
Never gets old.

40:38.102 --> 40:40.230
Paul! I was just about to call you.

40:40.396 --> 40:42.273
I'm on my way home from work now.

40:42.482 --> 40:45.736
No, I never said that.
Well, traffic was crazy.

40:45.902 --> 40:49.952
So, if Curtis is married, what's the rule
on dating while vigilanting?

40:50.990 --> 40:54.369
Uh... One sec. The short answer is don't.

40:54.953 --> 40:57.047
Rory, wait up, can I talk to you?

40:57.956 --> 40:59.378
- Everything okay?
- Yeah.

40:59.832 --> 41:01.049
No.

41:02.919 --> 41:06.719
There's something that I need you to know
about Havenrock.

41:07.465 --> 41:10.685
Havenrock was not the intended target.

41:11.552 --> 41:12.974
Monument Point was.

41:14.847 --> 41:18.977
Someone redirected the missile
to reduce the number of casualties.

41:21.396 --> 41:23.569
That someone was me.

41:26.150 --> 41:28.824
I am so sorry.

41:43.626 --> 41:45.048
Oliver.

41:45.920 --> 41:46.921
Lyla.

41:47.088 --> 41:48.431
We need to talk about John.

41:48.673 --> 41:50.095
- Is he all right?
- No.

41:50.258 --> 41:52.056
He's back in the country.
And he's in prison.

41:53.136 --> 41:54.638
And I need you to break him out.
