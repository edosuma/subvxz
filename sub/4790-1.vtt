02:25.856 --> 02:27.712
[Chattering, Laughing]

02:27.712 --> 02:31.552
[Man On P.A. System]
The seminar will begin in five minutes.

02:31.552 --> 02:34.433
It will be in room "C."

02:34.433 --> 02:38.272
[Man]
So, uh, how about Chow Yun Fat?

02:38.272 --> 02:41.153
I don't know.
I love Chow Yun Fat.

02:41.153 --> 02:43.073
- I just don't see him playing Madman.
- Awesome.

02:43.073 --> 02:45.952
Thank you.

02:45.952 --> 02:47.862
[Chattering]

02:50.786 --> 02:54.582
Could you sign it:
"To a really big fan"?

02:56.578 --> 02:58.497
Uh, you bet.

02:58.497 --> 03:01.377
I love this book, man.
This shit is awesome!

03:01.377 --> 03:03.298
I wish I was like these guys.
Gettin' stoned,

03:03.298 --> 03:06.177
talkin' all raw about chicks
and fightin' supervillains!

03:06.177 --> 03:10.018
I love these guys! You know what.
They're like Bill and Ted...

03:10.018 --> 03:12.897
meet Cheech and Chong!

03:12.897 --> 03:14.818
Yeah. I kind of
like to think of them...

03:14.818 --> 03:16.738
as Rosencrantz and Guildenstern
meet Vladimir and Estragon.

03:16.738 --> 03:19.607
Yes! Who?

03:21.569 --> 03:24.386
So, do you, like,
draw this or something?

03:24.386 --> 03:27.298
[Sighs]

03:27.298 --> 03:29.217
I ink it, and I'm also the colorist.
The guy next to me draws it.

03:29.217 --> 03:32.098
But we both came up
with the characters. Next!

03:32.098 --> 03:33.057
What does that mean,
you "ink it"?

03:33.057 --> 03:35.938
Well, it means that Holden
draws the pictures in pencil.

03:35.938 --> 03:38.818
And then he gives it to me
to go over in ink. Next!

03:38.818 --> 03:41.698
So, basically,
you just trace.

03:41.698 --> 03:45.538
It's, uh, it's not tracing,
all right?

03:45.538 --> 03:48.418
I add depth and shading to give
the image more definition.

03:48.418 --> 03:51.298
Only then does the drawing
truly take shape.

03:51.298 --> 03:56.130
No, no, no. You go over what he draws
with a pen, all right? That's tracing.

03:56.130 --> 03:58.999
Not really. Next.

04:00.963 --> 04:03.843
Hey, man,
let me ask you somethin'.

04:03.843 --> 04:06.722
Somebody draws something
and then you draw the exact same thing,

04:06.722 --> 04:10.563
like, right on top of it without going
outside the original designated art.

04:10.563 --> 04:12.483
What do you call that?

04:12.483 --> 04:15.363
- I don't know, man. Tracing?
- See?

04:15.363 --> 04:16.322
You want your book signed
or what?

04:16.322 --> 04:18.232
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

04:19.202 --> 04:22.978
Don't get all testy just because you
got a problem with your station in life.

04:22.978 --> 04:23.939
Oh, I'm secure
with what I do.

04:23.939 --> 04:26.850
Then just say it.
You're a tracer.

04:26.850 --> 04:28.770
How should I sign this?

04:28.770 --> 04:30.723
I don't want you
to sign it, man.

04:30.723 --> 04:32.643
I want the guy who draws Bluntman
& Chronic to sign it.

04:32.643 --> 04:36.483
- You're just the tracer.
- Tell him, little shaver.

04:36.483 --> 04:40.323
- Who do I sign it to?
- [Crashing]

04:40.323 --> 04:42.243
[Shouting Indistinctly]
You fuckin' tracer!

04:42.243 --> 04:46.083
I'll trace a chalk line around
your dead fuckin' body, you fuck!

04:46.083 --> 04:48.004
Would you get him
outta here?

04:48.004 --> 04:52.803
Hey, wait a second! He jumped me!
You fuckin' tracer!

04:52.803 --> 04:54.724
Your mother's a tracer!

04:54.724 --> 04:56.643
Can I explain the audience
principle to you?

04:56.643 --> 04:58.595
If you assault and accost them,
then we have no audience.

04:58.595 --> 05:02.467
He started it,
fuckin' cock-knocker!

05:02.467 --> 05:06.307
He's lucky I didn't put
my pen through his thorax!

05:06.307 --> 05:10.147
Need I remind you?
Curtain's in ten minutes. Okay?

05:10.147 --> 05:13.027
[Man On P.A.] The Word's Up; Minority
Voices in Comics panel discussion...

05:13.027 --> 05:15.897
- All right.
- Is about to begin in room "F."

05:16.867 --> 05:19.684
For years in this industry...

05:19.684 --> 05:23.524
whenever an African-American
character... hero or villain...

05:23.524 --> 05:27.364
was introduced, usually,
by white artists and writers,

05:27.364 --> 05:30.275
they got slapped
with racist names...

05:30.275 --> 05:33.145
that singled them out
as Negroes.

05:35.108 --> 05:37.988
Now, my book...

05:37.988 --> 05:40.867
White Hatin'Coon...

05:40.867 --> 05:42.787
don't have none
of that bullshit.

05:42.787 --> 05:45.668
The hero's name is Maleekwa,
a descendant from the black tribe...

05:45.668 --> 05:48.548
that established
the first society on the planet,

05:48.548 --> 05:51.428
while you European motherfuckers
were still hidin' in caves and shit,

05:51.428 --> 05:54.308
all terrified of the sun.

05:54.308 --> 05:59.108
He's a strong role model that
a young black reader can look up to,

05:59.108 --> 06:03.012
'cause I'm here to tell ya: The chickens
is comin' home to roost, y'all.

06:03.012 --> 06:06.852
The black man's no longer gonna play the
minstrel in comics and sci-fi fantasy.

06:06.852 --> 06:11.653
We keepin' it real, and we gonna
get respect by any means necessary.

06:11.653 --> 06:15.493
Ah, come on!
That's a bunch of horseshit!

06:15.493 --> 06:18.308
Lando Calrissian
was a black guy, you know.

06:18.308 --> 06:20.228
He got to fly the Millennium Falcon.
What's the matter with you?

06:20.228 --> 06:23.108
- Who said that?
- I did.

06:23.108 --> 06:26.948
Lando Calrissian is a positive role
model in science-fiction fantasy.

06:26.948 --> 06:29.828
Fuck Lando Calrissian!
Uncle Tom nigger!

06:29.828 --> 06:32.708
Always some white boy
gotta invoke the holy trilogy.

06:32.708 --> 06:38.533
Those movies are about how the
white man keeps the brother man down...

06:38.533 --> 06:41.413
even in a galaxy
far, far away.

06:41.413 --> 06:45.253
Check this shit. You got
cracker farm boy Luke Skywalker...

06:45.253 --> 06:47.173
Nazi poster boy...
blond hair, blue eyes...

06:47.173 --> 06:49.093
and then you got
Darth Vader.

06:49.093 --> 06:51.973
The blackest brother
in the galaxy... Nubian guy.

06:51.973 --> 06:54.843
- What's a Nubian?
- Shut the fuck up!

06:56.773 --> 07:00.613
Now, Vader, he's a spiritual
brother, you know.

07:00.613 --> 07:02.533
Down with the force
and all that good shit.

07:02.533 --> 07:05.478
Then this cracker... Skywalker...
gets his hands on a light saber,

07:05.478 --> 07:08.357
and the boy decides he's gonna
run the fuckin' universe.

07:08.357 --> 07:11.237
Gets a whole Klan
of whites together.

07:11.237 --> 07:14.117
And they gonna bust up
Vader's hood, the Death Star.

07:14.117 --> 07:15.974
Now, what the fuck
do you call that?

07:15.974 --> 07:18.843
- Intergalactic civil war?
- Gentrification!

07:20.773 --> 07:24.613
They gonna drive out
the black element...

07:24.613 --> 07:27.493
to make the galaxy
"safe" for white folks.

07:27.493 --> 07:31.333
And Jedi's the most
insulting installment!

07:31.333 --> 07:34.213
Because Vader's beautiful
black visage is sullied...

07:34.213 --> 07:39.078
when he pulls off his mask to reveal
a feeble, crusty, old white man.

07:39.078 --> 07:43.835
They're tryin'to tell us that deep
inside we all wants to be white!

07:44.838 --> 07:47.707
Well, isn't that true?

07:50.598 --> 07:52.508
- [Audience Screaming]
- [Microphone Whining]

07:56.359 --> 07:57.318
- Black rage!
- [Gunshot]

07:57.318 --> 07:59.239
Black rage!
I'll kill any white folks...

07:59.239 --> 08:04.028
I lay my motherfuckin'eyes on!

08:28.039 --> 08:30.919
"What's a Nubian?"
Bitch, you almost made me laugh.

08:30.919 --> 08:33.799
Man, what about you? You didn't tell
me you were gonna scream, "Black rage!"

08:33.799 --> 08:35.719
I nearly pissed myself.

08:35.719 --> 08:37.671
How do you manage to get away
with this all the time?

08:37.671 --> 08:40.551
I mean, shouldn't the cops be busting
your head open right about now?

08:40.551 --> 08:44.423
- Wrong coast.
- Well, this here, she full of blanks.

08:44.423 --> 08:49.224
And, uh, Opiate gets all sorts
of legal clearances before I go on.

08:49.224 --> 08:51.143
So your publisher actually
condones these theatrics?

08:51.143 --> 08:55.944
Condones? Honey, they insist. I need
to sell the image to sell the book.

08:55.944 --> 08:57.863
Would the audience still buy
the whole black rage angle...

08:57.863 --> 09:01.703
if they found out the book
was written by a, a... you know.

09:01.703 --> 09:03.613
- Faggot?
- When you say it, it sounds so sexy.

09:04.584 --> 09:09.416
Hey, hey, hey! I'll play your victim,
but not your catcher, all right?

09:09.416 --> 09:12.295
Hooper, how come you sound like Minister
Farrakhan when you're onstage...

09:12.295 --> 09:15.207
and the king of pop
when you're not?

09:15.207 --> 09:17.127
Look out, boys!
This kitten has a whip!

09:17.127 --> 09:19.047
[Alyssa] Always before
I get to speak, you dick.

09:19.047 --> 09:20.967
- [Laughs]
- I swear! Jesus!

09:20.967 --> 09:23.848
The next con I attend, and they
ask me to be on the minority panel,

09:23.848 --> 09:27.687
if I see your name anywhere
near that list, I'm passing!

09:27.687 --> 09:31.527
Holden, Banky, this pile
of P.M.S. Is Alyssa Jones.

09:31.527 --> 09:33.448
She does that book,
Idiosyncratic Routine.

09:33.448 --> 09:39.207
Oh, I've read your book. It's cute.
Chick stuff, but cute. What?

09:39.207 --> 09:42.120
Sorry about him. He's, uh,
he's dealing with being an inker.

09:42.120 --> 09:43.081
Sorry about him. He's, uh,
he's dealing with being an inker.

09:43.081 --> 09:44.040
Oh. You trace.

09:44.040 --> 09:49.833
I really like your book. I'm surprised
we never met at any other cons before.

09:49.833 --> 09:51.752
Yeah, well, lose the dick
or change the skin tone,

09:51.752 --> 09:54.632
and we can get to know
each other on panel after panel.

09:54.632 --> 09:59.432
These boys do Bluntman & Chronic, which
outsells both of our books put together.

09:59.432 --> 10:02.312
Hence, they're never on the panel
with the likes of us.

10:02.312 --> 10:04.222
They slummin' it right now.

10:05.192 --> 10:07.047
I promised Alyssa
I'd buy her a post-rave drink.

10:08.008 --> 10:09.929
Do the Garden Staters have
to sprint to the Lincoln Tunnel,

10:09.929 --> 10:12.840
or can you stay for a round
in the big, scary city?

10:12.840 --> 10:14.750
- We're gonna go...
- We'll take...

10:16.681 --> 10:19.550
[Sighs]
We'll go.

10:22.472 --> 10:24.393
[Banky]
Archie. All right?

10:24.393 --> 10:27.273
Archie and the Riverdale gang were
a pure and fun-lovin' bunch.

10:27.273 --> 10:31.113
You can't find dysfunction in those
comics. They were flat-out wholesome.

10:31.113 --> 10:33.993
- Archie and Jughead were lovers.
- Shut the fuck up!

10:33.993 --> 10:38.793
It's true. Archie was the bitch,
andJughead was the butch.

10:38.793 --> 10:41.673
That's whyJughead wears
that crown-lookin' hat all the time.

10:41.673 --> 10:44.585
He the king of
Queen Archie's world.

10:44.585 --> 10:46.504
Man, I feel
a hate crime comin' on.

10:46.504 --> 10:49.417
Well, you know,
he does have a point.

10:49.417 --> 10:51.338
I mean, Archie never did quite
settle on Betty or Veronica.

10:51.338 --> 10:54.218
'Cause he wanted them both
at the same time, you assholes!

10:54.218 --> 10:57.098
He didn't choose one, because he was
trying to get them into a three-way.

10:57.098 --> 11:00.938
- Here.
- What?

11:00.938 --> 11:04.713
I want you to go down to the corner
store and buy yourself a clue.

11:04.713 --> 11:06.633
- Go on.
- Eat it, Urkel.

11:06.633 --> 11:10.474
Uh! I done told you to
watch it with that Urkel shit.

11:10.474 --> 11:13.375
Face it, girl.
Archie's a sister.

11:15.305 --> 11:19.134
- That's it. You!
- Moi?

11:20.105 --> 11:23.018
Yeah, you. You are marching
back across the street with me,

11:23.018 --> 11:25.898
and we're gonna pick up
a shitload of Archie books.

11:25.898 --> 11:28.778
And I'm going to prove to you
beyond the shadow of a doubt...

11:28.778 --> 11:31.658
that Archie
is all about pussy.

11:31.658 --> 11:33.578
- Come on!
- [Laughs]

11:33.578 --> 11:35.488
This boy is conflicted.

11:37.419 --> 11:39.338
I shall play
mother therapist for him.

11:39.338 --> 11:42.208
You two sit tight.
We shall return promptly.

11:46.090 --> 11:48.010
Is he always like that?

11:48.010 --> 11:50.890
Who, him? Yeah.
Ever since the third grade.

11:50.890 --> 11:53.801
This, uh, this nun was teaching us
about the Blessed Trinity, you know?

11:53.801 --> 11:57.642
She was going on and on about
the three persons in one God thing.

11:57.642 --> 11:59.562
Father, Son,
the Holy Spirit.

11:59.562 --> 12:02.379
Banky just goes ballistic on her.
They got in this huge fight.

12:02.379 --> 12:06.218
An eight-year-old kid?
How bad could it have been?

12:06.218 --> 12:09.099
Well, have you ever seen a nun call
a small child a "fucking cunt-rag"?

12:09.099 --> 12:11.979
It wasn't pretty.
Shit like that's bound to happen...

12:11.979 --> 12:14.891
when you make a kid wear
a matching tie and slacks every day.

12:14.891 --> 12:19.690
Right. And your parochial
school misadventures?

12:19.690 --> 12:22.560
Oh, mostly limited to
wine-tasting prior to mass.

12:23.530 --> 12:25.482
Turned me into a grade school
alcoholic altar boy though.

12:25.482 --> 12:27.402
Can't tell you how many mornings
after serious benders...

12:27.402 --> 12:30.282
I'd wake up next
to strange priests.

12:30.282 --> 12:33.162
- Aren't you the sharp wit?
- Sharp? No.

12:33.162 --> 12:36.042
I'm just a fan of
clergy-molestation humor.

12:36.042 --> 12:40.831
Probably why the extended family quit
inviting me to first communion parties.

12:42.762 --> 12:45.643
Tsk. You play darts?

12:45.643 --> 12:49.515
Uh, not professionally.
You know, only in bars.

12:49.515 --> 12:51.425
[Alyssa]
I don't know.

12:52.395 --> 12:56.235
Maybe I should just sign one of those
exclusive deals like you guys.

12:56.235 --> 12:58.187
Your new book seems
to be selling like mad.

12:58.187 --> 13:01.963
Well, it all goes back to somethin'
my grandmother told me when I was a kid.

13:01.963 --> 13:06.763
"Holden," she said, "the big bucks
are in dick and fart jokes."

13:06.763 --> 13:08.683
- She was a churchgoer.
- Oh!

13:08.683 --> 13:12.523
The cry from the heart of a real artist
trapped in commercial hell,

13:12.523 --> 13:15.403
pitying his good fortune.

13:15.403 --> 13:18.316
I'm sure you can dry your eyes
on all those fat checks you rake in.

13:18.316 --> 13:22.156
Oh, I'm sorry. What was that? Did I
detect a note of bitter envy in there?

13:22.156 --> 13:25.036
No, I'm happy my stuff
gets read at all.

13:25.036 --> 13:26.956
There's very little market
for hearts and flowers...

13:26.956 --> 13:31.788
in this spandex-clad, big pecs,
big tits, big guns field.

13:31.788 --> 13:34.667
If I sell two issues,
I feel likeJohn Grisham.

13:34.667 --> 13:36.588
Well, it's all
about marketing.

13:36.588 --> 13:41.387
Over- or underweight guys that don't
get laid. They're our bread and butter.

13:41.387 --> 13:44.267
People like those two outside
should be yours.

13:44.267 --> 13:47.148
And sadly, there are more
of our core audience.

13:47.148 --> 13:51.020
Kind of gives you a charge though.
See two people like that in love.

13:51.020 --> 13:52.941
And all over
Banky's car, no less.

13:52.941 --> 13:55.821
You know, that car's seeing more action
right now than it's seen in years.

13:55.821 --> 14:00.556
- Bubbly guy. It's hard to figure out.
- Yeah.

14:00.556 --> 14:03.468
You gotta respect that kind of display
of affection. You know what I mean?

14:03.468 --> 14:06.348
Sure, it's crazy.
It's rude. It's self-absorbed.

14:06.348 --> 14:09.228
But, uh, you know,
it's love.

14:09.228 --> 14:12.109
- It's not love.
- Oh, says you.

14:12.109 --> 14:14.988
That out there?
That's fleeting.

14:14.988 --> 14:17.868
- Fleeting?
- Mm-hmm. Well, I gotta split.

14:17.868 --> 14:21.741
It was really nice meeting you.
Good luck with your book.

14:21.741 --> 14:26.531
Tell Hooper I'll call him later.
And... tell your friend to calm down.

14:31.341 --> 14:34.253
[Hooper]
Shut up already.

14:34.253 --> 14:37.133
You shut up!
You're insane.

14:37.133 --> 14:39.053
Archie is not fucking
Mr. Weatherbee!

14:39.053 --> 14:42.893
Deny, deny, deny.

14:42.893 --> 14:46.733
- Where's Alyssa?
- She left, said she'd call you later.

14:46.733 --> 14:49.613
Look, he's just offering to help Archie
with his fuckin' homework!

14:49.613 --> 14:51.565
Read between
the lines, bitch.

14:51.565 --> 14:54.434
Fuck this. Let's go.
Traffic.

14:55.341 --> 14:57.262
- Holden!
- What?

14:57.262 --> 15:01.101
- Let's go!
- See that dent in the hood of your car?

15:01.101 --> 15:03.011
Son of a bitch!

15:07.853 --> 15:10.733
Let me guess.
You like her.

15:10.733 --> 15:12.621
- Who?
- Miss Alyssa Jones.

15:15.533 --> 15:19.374
- She's all right.
- As long as that's all.

15:19.374 --> 15:21.316
##[Rap, Indistinct]

15:42.478 --> 15:45.358
This is one of the best streetlights
you've ever drawn.

15:45.358 --> 15:47.278
It's the one from across the street
from the post office.

15:47.278 --> 15:50.159
- Looks just like it.
- Thanks.

15:50.159 --> 15:53.966
So, uh, what do you want
to do tonight?

15:53.966 --> 15:56.846
I don't know. Get a pizza.
Watch DegrassiJunior High.

15:56.846 --> 15:59.726
You got a weird thing
for Canadian melodrama.

15:59.726 --> 16:01.635
I got a weird thing
for girls who say "aboot."

16:02.607 --> 16:06.446
- [Phone Rings, Beeps]
- Bank Holdup.

16:06.446 --> 16:11.279
Hooper here. Listen, I know how
you 'burb fiends hate the city,

16:11.279 --> 16:15.119
but there's a club shindig goin' down
tonight I think you'd really get into.

16:15.119 --> 16:17.999
- Where is it?
- Meow Mix. I'm temping as barkeep.

16:17.999 --> 16:21.839
Oh, I don't know, Hoop.

16:21.839 --> 16:24.751
We're prepping the next issue. We got
that stupid meeting in the morning.

16:24.751 --> 16:27.620
- I told her you wouldn't be interested.
- Told who?

16:28.591 --> 16:30.511
Alyssa.

16:30.511 --> 16:32.430
Alyssa from last night Alyssa?

16:32.430 --> 16:34.351
How do you begin and end a question
with the same word like that?

16:34.351 --> 16:37.231
You got skill.
Yes, that one!

16:37.231 --> 16:39.140
She asked me to invite you.
Now, here's the part where you say...

16:40.111 --> 16:44.943
- I'll be there.
- Thought so. 10:00. Later.

16:44.943 --> 16:49.742
- Who was that?
- Hooper. He invited me to a club.

16:49.742 --> 16:53.520
Man, when's that faggot gonna learn?
You like chicks.

16:53.520 --> 16:56.432
- Not that kind of club.
- So when we leavin'?

16:56.432 --> 17:00.272
We? You can't go.
He's hookin' me up with Alyssa.

17:00.272 --> 17:04.112
- And?
- And I don't want you messing it up.

17:04.112 --> 17:06.992
I care about your shit.
Maybe I'll hook up myself.

17:06.992 --> 17:08.901
I told you. It's not
that kind of club.

17:10.832 --> 17:13.742
How does one man
get to be so funny?

17:13.742 --> 17:17.583
Look, how you gonna get
home when I hook up, huh?

17:17.583 --> 17:22.383
- Like that'll happen.
- Let me explain, my witless chum.

17:22.383 --> 17:24.303
The other night, we two,
Alyssa and I,

17:24.303 --> 17:26.244
we, uh, well,
we shared a moment.

17:27.215 --> 17:30.097
- Oh, you had a moment.
- No.

17:30.097 --> 17:32.976
We shared a moment,
all right?

17:32.976 --> 17:37.776
And in that moment, one thing
was made abundantly clear.

17:37.776 --> 17:41.616
This girl loves me,
my friend.

17:41.616 --> 17:44.496
Loves me. You know
what I'm sayin'?

17:44.496 --> 17:47.344
## [Humming]
#Ah, who's your daddy now #

17:47.344 --> 17:49.263
Come on. Mmm.
## [Humming]

17:49.263 --> 17:51.184
- #Ah #
- Shut up!

17:51.184 --> 17:55.024
# It's your birthday
It's your birthday ##

17:55.024 --> 17:59.856
# Go, Sheila, it's your birthday
Go, Sheila, It's your birthday #

17:59.856 --> 18:02.736
All right.
Bring on the free hootch.

18:02.736 --> 18:06.576
Free? I didn't invite your tired ass.
So, where's your better half?

18:06.576 --> 18:09.456
Takin' a piss. The guy's got
a bladder like an infant.

18:09.456 --> 18:12.337
That's funny. He says
you're hung like an infant.

18:12.337 --> 18:14.257
Does his mother
tell him everything?

18:14.257 --> 18:17.169
- Hey!
- What'd you do, fall in love?

18:17.169 --> 18:19.088
- Where is she?
- Over there.

18:19.088 --> 18:20.048
- Where is she?
- Over there.

18:20.048 --> 18:23.846
Look at her in her net shirt. Been
dancin'for an hour. Hasn't stopped yet.

18:24.849 --> 18:26.736
She ain't no Deney Terrio,
I'll say that.

18:27.762 --> 18:31.601
Listen, if I'm not back by Tuesday,
call my mother. All right?

18:31.601 --> 18:34.482
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
There's somethin' you should know.

18:34.482 --> 18:37.362
- She got a boyfriend?
- Well, no.

18:37.362 --> 18:41.202
Then what's to know, my friend?
[Grunts] What's to know?

18:41.202 --> 18:44.071
##[Rap, Indistinct]

18:50.834 --> 18:53.713
Hey, lady! You fucked up
my cabbage patch!

18:53.713 --> 18:57.554
Well, well, well, if it isn't Bluntman
himself, or should I call you Chronic?

18:57.554 --> 19:01.425
Call me flattered. I heard you sent me
the invite to this little soiree.

19:01.425 --> 19:05.265
From a former hometown girl
to Mr. Hometown himself.

19:05.265 --> 19:08.146
- You're saying you're from the 'burbs?
- # Middletown, New Jersey #

19:08.146 --> 19:11.026
- Get outta here! I'm from Highlands!
- I know. Hooper told me.

19:11.026 --> 19:12.945
How is it that we never
ran into one another?

19:12.945 --> 19:14.866
- Did you graduate from Hudson?
- Yeah, '88.

19:14.866 --> 19:17.746
- I went to North.
- What a small fuckin' world.

19:17.746 --> 19:20.625
- So you know the tri-town area?
- Quiz me.

19:20.625 --> 19:22.578
- Miller Hill?
- I wrote my name on the wall.

19:22.578 --> 19:24.498
- Sandy Hook?
- Lost my virginity there.

19:24.498 --> 19:28.339
- This is so cool. The mall?
- Eton preppy or Menlo Park?

19:28.339 --> 19:31.249
Oh, no. Here's the big test.
Quick Stop?

19:31.249 --> 19:34.130
My best friend fucked
a dead guy in the bathroom.

19:34.130 --> 19:36.999
- You know that girl?
- I did, before she was committed.

19:39.890 --> 19:42.706
There's a lot of chicks
in this place.

19:42.706 --> 19:46.546
Chicks? You're such a man.

19:46.546 --> 19:49.415
You know what this is?
This is fate.

19:50.386 --> 19:54.258
No, this is "The Rog."
[Laughs]

19:54.258 --> 19:56.179
I'm talking about us meeting.
What are the chances?

19:56.179 --> 20:00.019
Pretty slim. I haven't been back
to the 'burbs since my friend's funeral.

20:00.019 --> 20:02.930
- The Quick Stop girl died?
- Uh-uh. Another girl.

20:02.930 --> 20:05.811
- Julie Dwyer. She died in the...
- The YMCA pool! Damn!

20:05.811 --> 20:07.730
- You knew her too?
- So well.

20:07.730 --> 20:10.600
Wow! One friend in the asylum,
the other friend in the grave.

20:11.571 --> 20:13.480
- You're a dangerous person to know.
- Ah, but I can tap.

20:14.450 --> 20:16.371
[Shoes Tapping]

20:16.371 --> 20:18.281
- That's the Buffalo two-step.
- Yeah, well, it's very solid.

20:19.251 --> 20:21.170
That's what six years
of tap lessons yields.

20:21.170 --> 20:25.011
Two towns away from each other
for years, we had to meet in New York.

20:25.011 --> 20:27.922
Could have been worse.
Could have not met at all.

20:27.922 --> 20:30.770
[Cheering, Applause]

20:33.715 --> 20:36.595
Okay, we're back.

20:36.595 --> 20:38.515
Thank you. Thank you.

20:38.515 --> 20:41.331
So, a long time ago, we used
to have this bass player,

20:41.331 --> 20:44.200
who took off one day to draw
funny books or something.

20:45.172 --> 20:48.040
Maybe you've heard of her stuff?
Idiosyncratic Routine?

20:50.931 --> 20:52.851
But what a lot of people
don't know...

20:52.851 --> 20:55.732
is that she used to harbor
these delusions that she could sing,

20:55.732 --> 20:59.561
and she used to subject us to throaty
renditions of Debbie Gibson tunes.

21:00.563 --> 21:02.483
[Crowd Laughing]

21:02.483 --> 21:05.396
So, she's here tonight,
and I think if we all beg her...

21:05.396 --> 21:08.275
or maybe offer her
some "X,"

21:08.275 --> 21:11.156
she'll come up here and treat us
to some of her vocal stylings.

21:11.156 --> 21:13.076
What do ya say, Alyssa?

21:13.076 --> 21:15.956
- Yeah!
- [Crowd Cheering]

21:15.956 --> 21:18.826
Oh, she's shy!

21:19.796 --> 21:21.705
Get up here and sing, bitch!

21:22.676 --> 21:25.556
All right!
Go. Go up there.

21:25.556 --> 21:27.476
Whoo!

21:27.476 --> 21:32.308
Whoo! Yea!
[Laughs]

21:32.308 --> 21:36.138
What am I doing here?
This is so fucking gay.

21:39.956 --> 21:43.796
She is such a cunt.

21:43.796 --> 21:47.636
You guys know the one
I wanna do, right?

21:47.636 --> 21:50.506
All right. I should
dedicate this, right?

21:52.437 --> 21:56.277
This is for that
someone special out there.

21:56.277 --> 21:59.157

##[Band Resumes]

24:59.831 --> 25:01.741
Hot!

25:05.591 --> 25:10.381
Now, that, my friend,
is a shared moment.

25:25.816 --> 25:27.672
- What?
- It's rude.

25:27.672 --> 25:30.542
When are we gonna get a chance to see
this shit live without payin' for it?

25:32.472 --> 25:37.273
- Sorry. It's just new to him.
- Oh, and you're an old hand at this?

25:37.273 --> 25:42.104
No, no, I should apologize. I don't
normally get all mushy in public,

25:42.104 --> 25:44.984
but it's been a while
since I've seen Kim here.

25:44.984 --> 25:47.897
You know what?
I wanna dance.

25:47.897 --> 25:49.816
Go ahead.
I'll watch from here.

25:49.816 --> 25:52.697
No!
I wanna dance with you!

25:52.697 --> 25:56.526
Don't be a rag. I have to sit here and
work up the desire to fuck you later.

25:58.457 --> 26:01.327
Please!

26:06.137 --> 26:07.096
Yes?

26:07.096 --> 26:09.017
You said "fuck."
She said "fuck."

26:09.017 --> 26:10.936
You said "fuck" to that girl.
You said that you'd fuck her.

26:10.936 --> 26:13.848
- And?
- How can a girl fuck another girl?

26:13.848 --> 26:15.769
Were you talking about
strap-ons or something?

26:15.769 --> 26:17.720
- Oh, Jesus. Would you shut up?
- What?

26:17.720 --> 26:19.640
It's okay.

26:19.640 --> 26:22.521
I don't know how many times
I can apologize for him.

26:22.521 --> 26:25.337
No, Banky, I've never
used a strap-on.

26:25.337 --> 26:27.257
Then what's with
saying "fuck"?

26:27.257 --> 26:32.057
Shouldn't you say "eat her out" or
modify the term "fuck" with "fist"?

26:32.057 --> 26:35.897
Let me ask you a question.
Can men fuck each other?

26:35.897 --> 26:39.737
- You asking for my permission?
- In your estimation.

26:39.737 --> 26:41.658
Sure.

26:41.658 --> 26:45.529
So, for you,
to fuck is to penetrate.

26:45.529 --> 26:48.410
You're used to the more
traditional definition.

26:48.410 --> 26:51.279
You, inside some girl you've
duped, jackhammerin' away,

26:52.281 --> 26:54.201
not noticing that
bored look in her eyes.

26:54.201 --> 26:58.040
Hey, I always notice that bored look
in their eyes, all right?

26:58.040 --> 27:01.881
Fucking is not limited
to penetration, Banky.

27:01.881 --> 27:05.721
For me, it describes any sex
when it's not totally about love.

27:05.721 --> 27:08.602
I don't love Kim,
but I'll fuck her.

27:08.602 --> 27:10.521
I'm sure you don't love
every girl you sleep with.

27:10.521 --> 27:12.441
Some of them
I downright loathe.

27:12.441 --> 27:16.314
Aha, but I'll bet it's different
with the ones you do love.

27:16.314 --> 27:18.233
Like, you'll go down
on 'em longer.

27:18.233 --> 27:19.183
- Here we go.
- I don't do that.

27:20.154 --> 27:23.001
- What?
- I stopped. It got to be frustrating.

27:23.001 --> 27:25.882
As stupid as you usually come off
during this little diatribe of yours,

27:25.882 --> 27:28.762
you're gonna come off ten times
as stupid on this occasion.

27:28.762 --> 27:31.642
I lost my tolerance for the baggage
that comes with eating girls out.

27:31.642 --> 27:33.561
What's the big deal?

27:33.561 --> 27:35.482
If you say the smell,
so help me, I will slug you.

27:35.482 --> 27:38.362
Not the smell.
The smell is good.

27:38.362 --> 27:40.282
I'm talkin' about not being
able to do it properly.

27:40.282 --> 27:42.202
My mother
brought me up to believe...

27:42.202 --> 27:45.082
if I can't do something right,
I shouldn't do it at all.

27:45.082 --> 27:48.955
Of course, my father told me she gave
lousy head, but that's beside the point.

27:48.955 --> 27:51.835
Well, at least you blame yourself
for your sexual inadequacies.

27:51.835 --> 27:53.744
No. I blame them.

27:54.746 --> 27:58.587
Chicks never help you out.
They never tell you what to do, right?

27:58.587 --> 28:02.427
And most of them are all self-conscious
about the smell factor.

28:02.427 --> 28:06.256
And, so, most of the time, they just lay
there frozen like a deer in headlights.

28:07.226 --> 28:09.147
I mean, not for nothin',
but when a chick goes down on me,

28:09.147 --> 28:12.027
I let her know where to go
and what the status is.

28:12.027 --> 28:15.867
You gotta handle it like
CNN and the Weather Channel.

28:15.867 --> 28:18.778
Constant updates.

28:18.778 --> 28:20.698
- You are such an idiot.
- [Growls]

28:20.698 --> 28:23.578
No, no, he's got a point.
I mean, that's how I was in high school.

28:23.578 --> 28:27.451
You know, all nervous and
inhibited about being eaten out.

28:27.451 --> 28:31.291
But by the time I got
to college, that all changed.

28:31.291 --> 28:33.211
I've loosened up.

28:33.211 --> 28:35.131
I was like one of those guys at
the airport with those big flashlights,

28:35.131 --> 28:38.971
wavin' 'em this way, directin' 'em
that way, tellin' 'em when to stop.

28:38.971 --> 28:42.812
And that's all I'm sayin'. It would
be different if chicks helped out.

28:42.812 --> 28:44.731
You know, pointed a guy
in the right direction.

28:44.731 --> 28:50.523
There'd be no bullshit, no wasted time
and no chance for permanent injuries.

28:50.523 --> 28:52.443
Permanent injuries?

28:52.443 --> 28:56.284
Sure. You wanna see
somethin' permanent?

28:56.284 --> 28:58.236
- See that?
- Uh-huh.

28:58.236 --> 29:01.116
I got that from Nina Rollins,
sophomore year.

29:01.116 --> 29:03.036
I'm goin' down on her,
right?

29:03.036 --> 29:04.956
- [Moaning]
- Out of nowhere, her cat jumps on her.

29:04.956 --> 29:09.756
She does this big pelvic thrust, cracks
my tooth and sends it down my throat.

29:09.756 --> 29:12.625
I had to get a crown
for the stub.

29:14.556 --> 29:17.436
I got that beat.
I got that beat.

29:17.436 --> 29:22.203
Junior year, I'm goin'down
on Cynthia Slater in her dorm room.

29:22.203 --> 29:27.004
I'm totally drunk, and in the middle
of it, I fall asleep right in her lap.

29:27.004 --> 29:28.923
She got so mad,
she digs her heel into my back.

29:28.923 --> 29:32.797
- Ow!
- Right there. That's permanent.

29:32.797 --> 29:36.594
All right. All right.
See this?

29:38.556 --> 29:41.436
That's the farthest I can
move my neck to the right.

29:41.436 --> 29:45.276
Again, sophomore year,
I'm goin' out with Brandy Svining.

29:45.276 --> 29:49.116
And for six months, I'm goin' down
on her. Not a damn thing's happening.

29:49.116 --> 29:52.019
So, one night, I change a position
or vary my lapping speed,

29:52.988 --> 29:56.829
and suddenly it's
a whole new world.

29:56.829 --> 29:59.709
She's movin' around,
convulsing, breathing heavy,

29:59.709 --> 30:01.618
and her legs are pressed up
against my ears so tightly...

30:02.620 --> 30:05.500
that I don't hear her father
come into the room.

30:05.500 --> 30:09.297
He grabs my hair and
pulls me way back, hard.

30:13.180 --> 30:15.995
Senior year,
spring formal.

30:16.957 --> 30:18.866
I'm eatin' out Missy Kurt
in her brother's car.

30:19.838 --> 30:23.709
She's layin' across the backseat. I'm
half hangin' out, knees on the ground.

30:23.709 --> 30:28.509
She's flailin' around, and she...
she knocks the parking brake off.

30:28.509 --> 30:32.349
The car starts
rolling down the hill.

30:32.349 --> 30:36.220
And my left knee
is cut up to shit...

30:36.220 --> 30:40.978
like a kiddy's scissors class
cut it up for paper dolls!

30:43.901 --> 30:48.690
[Laughing Continues]

30:55.454 --> 30:57.374
Whoa! Hey!
Look at the time.

30:57.374 --> 30:59.293
We gotta... We gotta
beat that traffic, huh?

30:59.293 --> 31:02.174
What traffic?
It's 1:30 in the morning.

31:02.174 --> 31:05.054
And rush hour
starts in six hours. Let's go.

31:05.054 --> 31:09.885
Uh, thanks for inviting us out.
It was educational.

31:09.885 --> 31:11.773
Come on.

31:16.541 --> 31:18.461
Since you like
chicks, right,

31:18.461 --> 31:20.371
you just look at yourself naked
in the mirror all the time?

31:30.014 --> 31:31.934
[Holden]
Look, here's the deal.

31:31.934 --> 31:33.855
When we get in there, don't be a
complete Potzer, like last night.

31:33.855 --> 31:35.774
This is business now, okay?

31:35.774 --> 31:40.607
Oh, why are you in such a bad mood?
Still dwelling on that dyke?

31:40.607 --> 31:42.526
- Hey, knock it off, will you?
- What'd I tell you?

31:42.526 --> 31:44.446
She just needs
the right guy.

31:44.446 --> 31:49.246
All every woman really wants
is some serious deep-dicking.

31:49.246 --> 31:53.075
- [Phone Ringing]
- Sorry.

31:54.047 --> 31:56.958
See, that's why
I can't buy lesbians.

31:56.958 --> 31:59.838
Everyone needs dick.

31:59.838 --> 32:01.758
See, I can buy fags,
a bunch of guys that need dick.

32:01.758 --> 32:04.638
You know, just plain need it.
That I get.

32:04.638 --> 32:08.478
Dykes?
Bullshit posturing.

32:08.478 --> 32:11.327
But, live and let live,
I guess.

32:11.327 --> 32:13.214
I'm sure the gay community
appreciates your support.

32:14.207 --> 32:17.054
We'd like to start off by saying that it
is a real pleasure to finally meet you.

32:18.047 --> 32:19.966
Absolute pleasure.

32:19.966 --> 32:22.847
One of the reasons we started this whole
thing was to finally meet the guys...

32:22.847 --> 32:24.767
that do Bluntman & Chronic.

32:24.767 --> 32:26.718
- [Together] Snootchie bootchies!
- Huh?

32:26.718 --> 32:30.558
Which now brings us
to our proposal.

32:30.558 --> 32:32.479
Look, fellas, the days
of Butt-Head are over.

32:32.479 --> 32:37.278
We're interested in doing 12 half-hour
Bluntman & Chronic cartoons.

32:37.278 --> 32:40.158
What do you say?

32:40.158 --> 32:41.119
What do you say?

32:41.119 --> 32:42.067
Are we in business?

32:45.951 --> 32:47.872
- [Knocking Gently]
- [TV] The boy wonder.

32:47.872 --> 32:52.672
[TV] Batman and Robin, the dynamic
duo against crime and corruption.

32:52.672 --> 32:55.552
Yeah, hi. Somebody told me
they make comic books here,

32:55.552 --> 32:58.454
which is so weird, because I have
this great idea for a story.

32:59.423 --> 33:02.304
It's about a guy who comes
to this club and... [Whistles]

33:02.304 --> 33:04.223
Hightails it
when he finds out...

33:04.223 --> 33:06.133
Ready for this?

33:08.032 --> 33:10.879
This girl is gay.

33:12.799 --> 33:16.672
Any interest
in a story like that?

33:16.672 --> 33:18.592
- An animated series?
- Twelve episodes.

33:18.592 --> 33:21.472
- Well, that's great, isn't it?
- Banky seems to think so.

33:21.472 --> 33:24.352
- But you don't.
- Well, I...

33:24.352 --> 33:27.232
I don't know if that's the perception
I want people to have of our work.

33:27.232 --> 33:29.184
I know this sounds pretentious
as hell, but...

33:29.184 --> 33:31.093
I'd like to think of us
as artists, you know?

33:32.064 --> 33:34.944
I'd like to get back to doing something
more personal, like our first book.

33:34.944 --> 33:37.824
Well, when are you
gonna do that?

33:37.824 --> 33:40.693
When we have something
personal to say.

33:41.664 --> 33:43.584
I weirded you out
the other night.

33:43.584 --> 33:46.497
Uh, no, not really.

33:46.497 --> 33:49.377
- Oh, come on!
- Well, it's just...

33:49.377 --> 33:51.296
I'd never seen that kind of thing
up close and personal before.

33:51.296 --> 33:53.217
It just took a while
to process.

33:53.217 --> 33:55.137
You wanna talk about it?

33:55.137 --> 33:58.016
If you want to.

33:58.016 --> 33:59.969
I like you, Holden.

33:59.969 --> 34:02.849
I haven't liked a man
in a long time.

34:02.849 --> 34:06.623
And it's not because I'm a man-hater
or something like that.

34:07.584 --> 34:10.464
It's just been some time since I've
been exposed to a man that didn't...

34:10.464 --> 34:14.304
immediately live into
a stereotype of some sort.

34:14.304 --> 34:16.214
And I want you to feel
comfortable with me,

34:17.184 --> 34:20.097
because I'd really like us
to be friends.

34:20.097 --> 34:22.976
So if there's anything you
wanna know, it's okay to ask me.

34:22.976 --> 34:25.858
- Okay.
- Okay.

34:25.858 --> 34:29.719
Okay. Why girls?

34:30.688 --> 34:34.529
- Why men?
- Well, because that's the standard.

34:34.529 --> 34:37.409
If that's the only reason
you're attracted to women...

34:37.409 --> 34:39.329
No, it's more than that.

34:39.329 --> 34:41.248
So you've never been
curious about men?

34:41.248 --> 34:45.078
Curious? Well, I always wondered
why my father watched Hee Haw, but...

34:46.050 --> 34:47.969
- [Laughs] You know what I mean.
- No.

34:47.969 --> 34:49.920
- Why not?
- No interest.

34:49.920 --> 34:52.801
- Because?
- Girls feel right.

34:52.801 --> 34:56.641
Well, that's how I feel. You know,
I've never really been attracted to men.

34:56.641 --> 35:00.481
- Well, so, you're still a virgin then?
- No.

35:00.481 --> 35:02.434
But you've only
been with girls.

35:02.434 --> 35:04.289
So you're saying
a person is a virgin...

35:04.289 --> 35:07.170
until they've had intercourse
with a member of the opposite sex.

35:07.170 --> 35:09.090
Isn't that
the standard definition?

35:09.090 --> 35:11.010
Again with your standards.

35:11.010 --> 35:14.849
I think virginity is lost
when you make love for the first time.

35:14.849 --> 35:17.730
- With a member of the opposite sex.
- Why? Why only then?

35:17.730 --> 35:20.610
Because that's the standard.
What do you want me to tell ya?

35:20.610 --> 35:24.481
So if a virgin is raped,
then she's still a virgin?

35:24.481 --> 35:26.402
- No, of course not.
- But rape is not the standard.

35:26.402 --> 35:30.242
So she's had sex, but not
the standard idea of sex.

35:30.242 --> 35:33.155
Hence, according to your definition,
she'd still be a virgin.

35:33.155 --> 35:36.035
- Okay, fine, I'll revise.
- Uh-huh.

35:36.035 --> 35:38.914
[Clears Throat] Virginity is
lost when the hymen is broken.

35:38.914 --> 35:41.794
- Then I lost my virginity at ten.
- Really?

35:41.794 --> 35:45.634
'Cause, see, I fell on a fence post
when I was ten, and it broke my hymen.

35:45.634 --> 35:48.514
Okay. Second revision.

35:48.514 --> 35:50.424
Virginity is lost
through penetration.

35:51.395 --> 35:53.315
Physical penetration
or emotional.

35:53.315 --> 35:55.266
- Emotional penetration?
- Mmm.

35:55.266 --> 35:58.146
I fell in love hard with Caitlin Bree
when we were in high school.

35:58.146 --> 35:59.106
Physical penetration.

35:59.106 --> 36:01.888
- We had sex.
- Yeah, but not real sex.

36:03.875 --> 36:06.755
I move to have that remark
stricken from the record,

36:06.755 --> 36:10.595
on account of it makes you come off
as completely naive and infantile.

36:10.595 --> 36:13.465
Well, where's the penetration
in lesbian sex? I...

36:14.435 --> 36:18.264
A finger? I've had my finger up my
ass. I wouldn't say I've had anal sex.

36:20.195 --> 36:22.104
Observe.

36:25.027 --> 36:29.827
You're kidding me!
How?

36:29.827 --> 36:32.707
Our bodies are built to pass
a child, for Christ's sake.

36:32.707 --> 36:34.659
Yeah, but I mean... Jesus!
Doesn't that hurt?

36:34.659 --> 36:38.499
- Sure, but in that good way.
- Oh.

36:38.499 --> 36:42.339
And it's only a once-in-a-while thing
reserved for really special occasions.

36:42.339 --> 36:46.178
- How about not-so-special occasions?
- Tongue only.

36:46.178 --> 36:49.059
Well, but see... Come on.
That's what I'm sayin'.

36:49.059 --> 36:52.888
It's like, how can that be enough?
How big can a tongue really get?

36:56.739 --> 36:57.688
My God.

36:58.627 --> 37:02.424
[Laughs]
Let's go.

37:05.379 --> 37:07.299
Come on. Come on.

37:07.299 --> 37:10.180
You're really gonna have
to give me a minute, I think.

37:10.180 --> 37:12.089
[Holden] Would you stop futzing with
your fuckin'bag? We're late already.

37:13.060 --> 37:14.979
- [Banky] I have to get something.
- Look, man, we miss this train,

37:14.979 --> 37:17.860
I'm gonna shitcan you
and just hire Charles Schulz.

37:17.860 --> 37:21.699
Oh, my God. Who are you?
Larry Fucking Flynt?

37:21.699 --> 37:23.620
- What are you gonna do with all those?
- Read the articles.

37:23.620 --> 37:27.460
What do you think I'm gonna do
with 'em? They're stroke books, stupid.

37:27.460 --> 37:30.373
You got, like, 30 books in there.
We're only gonna be gone for two days.

37:30.373 --> 37:33.252
Variety is the spice of life.
I like a wide selection.

37:33.252 --> 37:36.164
Sometimes I'm in the mood
for nasty close-ups.

37:36.164 --> 37:38.084
Sometimes I like 'em
arty and airbrushed.

37:38.084 --> 37:40.004
Sometimes it's a spread
brown-eye kind of night.

37:40.004 --> 37:42.884
- Sometimes it's girl-on-girl time.
- [Beeping]

37:42.884 --> 37:44.804
Sometimes
a steamy letter will do.

37:44.804 --> 37:47.684
Sometimes, not often,
but sometimes...

37:47.684 --> 37:51.524
I like the idea
of a chick with a horse.

37:51.524 --> 37:54.405
Go get our tickets.
I gotta call Alyssa.

37:54.405 --> 37:56.313
- His master's voice.
- Put that stuff away!

38:05.956 --> 38:07.866
Hi.

38:14.629 --> 38:19.418
[Coins Clattering]

38:24.229 --> 38:28.069
[Alyssa] One minute, five seconds.
Ah, you are such my bitch.

38:28.069 --> 38:29.989
What's up?
I'm about to get on a train.

38:29.989 --> 38:33.860
- Oh! Why?
- Last-minute invite to the Boston Con.

38:33.860 --> 38:37.701
- Shit.
- What?

38:37.701 --> 38:39.653
Well, my sister's at my parents',
and I was gonna go see her.

38:39.653 --> 38:41.574
- The one that wrote the book?
- Yeah.

38:41.574 --> 38:46.374
But I was stayin' all weekend. I
wanted to hang out with you. This sucks.

38:46.374 --> 38:50.213
You know, um, both of us
don't have to go.

38:50.213 --> 38:52.134
- Really?
- Yeah. Banky can do this by himself.

38:52.134 --> 38:54.949
I mean, you know, it's not like we're on
a panel. It's just a signing appearance.

38:55.910 --> 38:57.830
If you come pick me up,
I'll be your best friend.

38:57.830 --> 39:00.710
Where's your apartment?

39:00.710 --> 39:04.550
And then Black Beauty
couldn't take it any longer,

39:04.550 --> 39:09.414
and he finally did
some of his own mounting.

39:09.414 --> 39:11.335
What are you doing?

39:11.335 --> 39:13.254
I think I want kids of my own
one day. They're fun.

39:13.254 --> 39:17.094
Listen to me. I'm not going. You're
gonna have to do this one by yourself.

39:17.094 --> 39:19.014
- What? Why?
- Alyssa's comin' down for the weekend.

39:19.014 --> 39:20.934
I'm gonna hang out with her.
You don't need me for this.

39:20.934 --> 39:23.814
Look, I'll take the bags.
You can, uh, keep the filth.

39:23.814 --> 39:25.734
I'll pick you up
at 9:00 Sunday night.

39:25.734 --> 39:28.615
Don't forget to plug the annual,
and don't mention the TV show, okay?

39:28.615 --> 39:31.495
Call me if you get bored.

39:31.495 --> 39:33.404
[Man]
All aboard!

39:36.294 --> 39:38.247
Explain this again.

39:38.247 --> 39:40.198
How could you have grown up
on the shore and never played skee-ball?

39:40.198 --> 39:42.118
What did you do
with your youth?

39:42.118 --> 39:44.998
Stayed out late,
smoked pot, screwed around.

39:44.998 --> 39:46.918
Not your grade school years,
your high school years.

39:46.918 --> 39:50.758
- This looks complicated.
- Jesus. Potzer, uh...

39:50.758 --> 39:52.615
- The premise is very basic, okay?
- Uh-huh.

39:52.615 --> 39:56.455
You roll the ball up the rampart in an
effort to pop it into the score circle.

39:56.455 --> 39:57.415
The higher the score,
the more prize tickets you get.

39:57.415 --> 39:59.335
Well, what do you do
with the prize tickets?

39:59.335 --> 40:02.215
You trade them in
for prizes,

40:02.215 --> 40:05.095
which are not worth nearly as much
as you've paid to play the game.

40:05.095 --> 40:07.976
- Well, what's the point?
- It's fun.

40:07.976 --> 40:10.886
And you question
my lifestyle.

40:10.886 --> 40:13.756
- [Coat Clatters On Floor]
- Observe.

40:19.559 --> 40:21.478
See? It's just that simple.

40:21.478 --> 40:24.358
Well, why not just walk up there
and put it in the 50 every time...

40:24.358 --> 40:28.199
- Well, where's the skill in that?
- Oh, this is a skill.

40:28.199 --> 40:30.119
I'm sorry.
I had no idea.

40:30.119 --> 40:32.029
Just toss one.

40:34.919 --> 40:36.839
[Ball Thuds,

40:36.839 --> 40:41.671
Uh, I'm sorry there, man.
She's a little new at this.

40:41.671 --> 40:43.623
Thanks. Thanks a lot.

40:43.623 --> 40:46.503
Underhand, okay?
Throw it underhand.

40:46.503 --> 40:49.319
And this is where you take
straight chicks on dates.

40:49.319 --> 40:51.239
This place is like Spanish fly.

40:51.239 --> 40:53.159
This will probably be the first time
I don't score afterward.

40:53.159 --> 40:56.029
I don't know. I'm starting to get
a tingle in my bottom.

40:58.920 --> 41:00.839
- Ten.
- Very nice.

41:00.839 --> 41:02.759
- So, what'd you do last night?
- Got laid.

[Machine Clattering]

41:07.559 --> 41:10.439

# Yes, I have

41:41.224 --> 41:43.144
#And I'll open the door #

41:43.144 --> 41:46.984
#And I wonder
if she might come in #

41:46.984 --> 41:52.745
#And do you really need
an invitation now #

41:52.745 --> 41:56.585
# 'Cause I think I'm feeling
really something today #

41:56.585 --> 42:00.425
# Yes, I think I feel
a little spark, hey #

42:00.425 --> 42:03.305
[Alyssa] Are you sure that
control is working, Banky?

42:03.305 --> 42:07.145
I thought you lived
in the city.

42:07.145 --> 42:09.065
It's like the umpteenth time
I've seen ya here.

42:09.065 --> 42:11.944
Isn't that grounds for the little pink
mafia to throw you outta their club?

42:11.944 --> 42:13.865
Hey! That's
the last time.

42:13.865 --> 42:17.769

42:51.370 --> 42:53.290
- Leave it alone.
- That chick bugs me.

43:00.010 --> 43:03.839
Your dyke-courting ass
just got me scored on.

43:04.810 --> 43:06.730
You know, you should
watch that, man.

43:06.730 --> 43:09.610
If you're gonna get so bent
outta shape while playing the game...

43:09.610 --> 43:12.490
so much so that you feel
the need to curse the TV...

43:12.490 --> 43:15.370
try not to gay bash it,
all right?

43:15.370 --> 43:17.290
You're not
that kind of guy.

43:17.290 --> 43:22.112
And don't call her a dyke.
She's a lesbian. Okay?

43:28.873 --> 43:31.753
What the fuck
is goin' on here?

43:31.753 --> 43:33.674
- I'm starting a new page?
- Not with this shit! With you!

43:33.674 --> 43:35.593
What the fuck is goin' on
with you and that girl?

43:35.593 --> 43:38.474
- We're just friends!
- She's programming you!

43:38.474 --> 43:40.394
I beg your pardon?
Programming?

43:40.394 --> 43:43.211
Yeah, and apparently you don't
even fuckin' realize it.

43:43.211 --> 43:46.090
What does it matter
if I refer to her as a dyke?

43:46.090 --> 43:48.992
Or if I call the Whalers faggots
in the privacy of my own office...

43:49.963 --> 43:51.882
far from the sensitive ears
of the rest of the world?

43:51.882 --> 43:55.754
Look, man, it's
passive-aggressive gay bashing.

43:55.754 --> 43:57.674
And I know you're not really
prejudiced at heart.

43:57.674 --> 44:03.425
I think you should find some other way
to express your anger is all I'm saying.

What are you doing?

44:17.835 --> 44:23.618
Just bear with me here. I want to
put you through this little exercise.

44:30.379 --> 44:34.176
All right, now, see this?
This is a four-way road, okay?

44:35.179 --> 44:38.955
And dead in the center is a crisp,
new hundred-dollar bill.

44:38.955 --> 44:42.794
Now, at the end of each of these streets
are four people. Okay? You following?

44:42.794 --> 44:44.715
- Yeah.
- Good.

44:44.715 --> 44:47.595

to the hundred-dollar bill first?

- What is this supposed to prove?
- No, I'm serious.

45:08.779 --> 45:11.660
This is a serious exercise.
It's like an S.A.T. Question.

45:11.660 --> 45:15.500
Which one is going to get
to the hundred-dollar bill first?

45:15.500 --> 45:18.380
The male-friendly lesbian?
The man-hating dyke?

45:18.380 --> 45:20.299
Santa Claus
or the Easter Bunny?

45:20.299 --> 45:22.252
- The man-hating dyke.
- Good.

45:22.252 --> 45:24.173
- Why?
- I don't know.

45:24.173 --> 45:28.013
Because the other three are figments
of your fucking imagination!

45:28.013 --> 45:30.925
I don't need this. I'll be hiding
from your fuckin' shit in my room.

45:30.925 --> 45:33.804

- What is it about this girl, man?

45:33.804 --> 45:36.620
You know you have no shot
at getting her into bed!

45:36.620 --> 45:38.507
Why do you bother
wasting time with her?

- Because you're Holden Fucking McNeil.
- Right.

That's not the path of least resistance.

a fuckin' challenge for you.

45:49.100 --> 45:51.021
And this little relationship
with that bitch...

45:51.021 --> 45:53.932
is a prime example
of your fucking condition.

Well, I don't need a magic eight ball
to look into your future.

You want a forecast? Here.
Will Holden ever fuck Alyssa?

46:00.653 --> 46:03.564
Oh, what a shock.
Not fucking likely.

46:03.564 --> 46:08.365
This relationship is affecting you,
our work and our friendship.

46:08.365 --> 46:11.245
The time's gonna come when I throw down
the gauntlet and say, "It's me or her."

46:11.245 --> 46:13.165
- Then what are you gonna say?
- I say you should let this one go!

46:13.165 --> 46:17.005
No. What would you say? Would you
trash 20 years of fuckin' friendship...

46:17.005 --> 46:18.925
because you've got
some idiotic notion...

46:18.925 --> 46:22.765
that this chick would even let you
sniff her panties, let alone fuck her?

46:22.765 --> 46:25.677

I'm telling you, okay? Let it go!

Are you an authorized deal maker
in this establishment?

47:26.222 --> 47:29.102
Do you have the power
to negotiate?

You wanna haggle over the price
of your French dip?

No, I wanna haggle
over the price of fine art.

47:36.782 --> 47:39.652
- What do you mean?
- There. By the kitchen.

47:40.654 --> 47:43.534
See? That painting.

47:43.534 --> 47:47.374
- What about it?
- The price tag says 75.

47:47.374 --> 47:51.214
- So?
- Tell me you're kidding.

47:51.214 --> 47:55.043

- I'm not. You are.

48:10.479 --> 48:12.399
Oh? You want me
to hang it for you?

You better hope it doesn't
get out to the girl nation...

48:14.319 --> 48:16.239
you needed a man
to help you hang a picture.

48:16.239 --> 48:20.079
No, no, no. You're going
to hang it in your house.

48:20.079 --> 48:22.949
- Yeah, right.
- I'm serious.

48:27.759 --> 48:31.567
- Why?
- Because it's captured the moment.

48:31.567 --> 48:34.447
It'll be a constant reminder,
not just of tonight,

48:34.447 --> 48:38.287
but of our introduction, of the building
of our friendship, everything.

48:38.287 --> 48:43.119
Make no mistake about it, my friend,
it is a gift from me to you,

48:43.119 --> 48:45.967

remember us.

49:18.704 --> 49:20.624
Although, I think
we're great friends.

49:20.624 --> 49:24.464
And not in a misplaced
affection, puppy dog way.

49:24.464 --> 49:26.320
Although, I'm sure
that's what you'll call it.

49:26.320 --> 49:29.200
I love you. Very...

49:29.200 --> 49:33.073
Very simple.
Very truly.

49:33.073 --> 49:37.873
You are the epitome of everything I have
ever looked for in another human being.

49:37.873 --> 49:39.793
And I know that you think of me
as just a friend,

49:39.793 --> 49:41.713
and crossing that line is the furthest
thing from an option...

49:41.713 --> 49:43.633
you would ever consider,

49:43.633 --> 49:48.464
but... [Sighs]
I had to say it.

49:48.464 --> 49:50.385
I just...
I can't take this anymore.

49:50.385 --> 49:53.265
I can't stand next to you
without wanting to hold you.

49:53.265 --> 49:56.144
I can't... I can't look into
your eyes without feeling that...

49:56.144 --> 49:59.024
that longing you only read about
in trashy romance novels.

49:59.024 --> 50:04.816
I can't talk to you without wanting to
express my love for everything you are.

50:04.816 --> 50:09.616
And I know this will probably queer
our friendship... no pun intended...

50:09.616 --> 50:15.376
[Sighs]
But I had to say it.

50:15.376 --> 50:18.289
'Cause I've never
felt this way before.

50:18.289 --> 50:23.985
And I don't care.
I like who I am because of it.

50:23.985 --> 50:26.866
And if bringing this to light
means we can't hang out anymore,

50:26.866 --> 50:29.746
then that hurts me.

50:29.746 --> 50:32.657
But, God, I just... I couldn't
allow another day to go by...

50:32.657 --> 50:36.497
without just getting it out there,
regardless of the outcome,

50:36.497 --> 50:41.287
which, by the look on your face,
is to be the inevitable...

50:42.257 --> 50:44.177
shoot down.

50:44.177 --> 50:49.969
And, you know,
I'll accept that.

50:49.969 --> 50:53.810
But I know... I know that some part
of you is hesitating for a moment.

50:53.810 --> 50:56.690
And if there's a moment of hesitation,
then that means you feel something too.

50:56.690 --> 50:58.610
And all I ask, please,
is that you just...

50:58.610 --> 51:04.393
you just not dismiss that and try
to dwell in it for just ten seconds.

51:05.362 --> 51:07.272
Ah.

51:08.242 --> 51:11.122
[Sighs]
Alyssa.

51:11.122 --> 51:15.922
There isn't another soul
on this fucking planet...

51:15.922 --> 51:20.722
who has ever made me half the person
I am when I'm with you.

51:20.722 --> 51:24.531
And I would risk this friendship for the
chance to take it to the next plateau,

51:24.531 --> 51:26.450
because it is there
between you and me.

51:26.450 --> 51:30.248
You can't deny that.

51:38.002 --> 51:40.872
Even if, you know...

51:44.723 --> 51:48.562
Even if we never talk again
after tonight,

51:48.562 --> 51:52.402
please know that
I am forever changed...

51:52.402 --> 51:57.235
because of who you are
and what you've meant to me,

51:57.235 --> 52:01.075
which, while I do
appreciate it,

52:01.075 --> 52:06.857
I'd never need a painting of birds
bought at a diner to remind me of.

52:20.243 --> 52:24.083
[Whispers]
Oh, God.

52:24.083 --> 52:26.994
Was it something I said?

52:26.994 --> 52:29.842
[Whispers]
Fuck.

52:31.795 --> 52:34.675
[Thunder Rumbling]

52:34.675 --> 52:37.588
- What are you doing?
- Get in the car and get outta here!

52:37.588 --> 52:39.507
- You're gonna hitch to New York?
- Yep!

52:39.507 --> 52:42.388
- Aren't you at least gonna comment?
- Here's my comment: Fuck you!

52:42.388 --> 52:44.308
- Why?
- That was so unfair.

52:44.308 --> 52:46.228
You know how unfair that was.

52:46.228 --> 52:48.148
What? It's unfair
that I'm in love with you?

52:48.148 --> 52:50.067
No, it's unfortunate
that you're in love with me.

52:50.067 --> 52:53.907
It's unfair you felt the fuckin' need
to unburden your soul about it.

52:53.907 --> 52:56.788
Do you remember for
one fucking second who I am?

52:56.788 --> 52:58.740
So? I mean, you know,
people change.

52:58.740 --> 53:00.659
Oh! Oh!
It's that simple!

53:00.659 --> 53:03.539
You fall in love with me and
want a romantic relationship.

53:03.539 --> 53:05.460
Nothing changes for you...

53:05.460 --> 53:08.372
with the exception of feeling
hunky-dory all the time.

53:08.372 --> 53:12.212
But what about me, Holden?
It's not that simple!

53:12.212 --> 53:14.131
I just can't get into
a relationship with you...

53:14.131 --> 53:16.946
without throwing my whole
fucking world into upheaval.

53:17.909 --> 53:21.749
That's every relationship. There's
always gonna be a period of adjustment.

53:21.749 --> 53:23.668
Period of adjustment?

53:23.668 --> 53:28.469
There's no period of adjustment,
Holden! I am fucking gay!

53:28.469 --> 53:30.420
That's who I am!

53:30.420 --> 53:36.137
You assume I can turn all that around
because you've got a fucking crush?

53:38.101 --> 53:40.052
If this is a crush,

53:40.052 --> 53:43.892
I don't think I could take it
if the real thing ever happened.

53:43.892 --> 53:45.812
Go home, Holden.

53:45.812 --> 53:48.682
[Thunder Rumbling]

54:17.492 --> 54:18.441
[Cries]

54:29.973 --> 54:31.883
[Thunder Rumbling]

55:07.683 --> 55:11.523
[Radio Announcer] You're back with
Chaz and Stu and the New Zoo Review.

55:11.523 --> 55:15.319
As always behind us we got wacky...
[Radio Continues, Indistinct]

55:31.650 --> 55:33.571
[Door Slams]

55:33.571 --> 55:35.490
I take it
that's not good.

55:35.490 --> 55:39.363
[Sighs]
Stay here.

55:39.363 --> 55:43.193
Be right back.
[Groans]

56:01.475 --> 56:04.356
Catholic schoolgirls.

56:04.356 --> 56:09.187
The uniform's
what does it for me.

56:09.187 --> 56:12.963
I wish I'd went with more
Catholic schoolgirls when I was a kid.

56:12.963 --> 56:18.747
As it stands, I have no "And then she
unzipped her jumper" stories.

56:19.715 --> 56:22.595
You seemed
weirded-out back there.

56:22.595 --> 56:27.396
- That's my couch you were fucking on.
- Sorry.

56:27.396 --> 56:30.276
I wanted to watch some TV.
Hard to do when your best friend is...

56:30.276 --> 56:34.116
wrapped around a naked
rug-muncher on your couch.

56:34.116 --> 56:36.986
She had boxers on.

56:39.877 --> 56:44.740
- [Sighs] This is all gonna end badly.
- You don't know that.

56:44.740 --> 56:47.621
I know you. You're way
too conservative for that girl.

56:47.621 --> 56:52.420
She's been around and seen things
we've only read about in books.

56:52.420 --> 56:56.260
We have read about them,
so we're prepared.

56:56.260 --> 56:59.130
There's no "we" here.

57:01.061 --> 57:02.980
You're gonna have to
go through this alone.

57:02.980 --> 57:04.901
It's one thing
to read about shit,

57:04.901 --> 57:09.700
something different when you're forced
to deal with it on a regular basis.

57:09.700 --> 57:12.570
When you are walking in a mall and your
heads turn at a nice-looking chick,

57:13.540 --> 57:16.484
it's gonna eat you up
inside.

57:16.484 --> 57:20.324
You'll spend most of your time wondering
when the other shoe's gonna drop.

57:20.324 --> 57:24.165
'Cause for you this isn't
about cool, weird sex stuff.

57:24.165 --> 57:27.044
It's about love.

57:27.044 --> 57:29.924
Maybe it is
for her as well.

57:29.924 --> 57:32.804
Somehow I doubt it.

57:32.804 --> 57:35.684
Everybody's not out
to get someone in life, Bank.

57:35.684 --> 57:39.524
Everybody has an agenda,
all right? Everyone.

57:39.524 --> 57:41.445
Yourself?

57:41.445 --> 57:44.325
- My agenda is to watch your back.
- To what end?

57:44.325 --> 57:47.269
To insure that all this time we've
spent together, building something,

57:47.269 --> 57:48.229
wasn't wasted.

57:48.229 --> 57:52.026
Oh, she's not gonna
ruin the comic.

57:53.989 --> 57:56.858
I wasn't talkin'
about the comic.

57:58.789 --> 58:01.669
[Sighing]
I'm gonna go get a bagel.

58:01.669 --> 58:05.444
Clean off my fucking couch
so I can watch TV.

58:08.325 --> 58:10.234
[Sighs]

58:15.045 --> 58:17.990
From what I understand,
when you sign with a publisher...

58:17.990 --> 58:19.877
someone else does all this work for you,
and you just sit back and collect.

58:20.869 --> 58:23.749
And miss these late-night cram sessions
with my nearest and dearest?

58:23.749 --> 58:25.670
- Never.
- I don't know what she's bitching about.

58:25.670 --> 58:28.550
All she's done since
we got here is pound Merlot.

58:28.550 --> 58:29.510
Yeah, you're a real help.

58:29.510 --> 58:32.390
I'd like to know
why we're here at all...

58:32.390 --> 58:34.309
when we haven't seen
Princess Funny Book in a month.

58:34.309 --> 58:39.099
- Yeah. Who you shackin' up with?
- "Shacking up with"? Please.

58:41.029 --> 58:42.950
[Giggling]
I'm so in love!

58:42.950 --> 58:44.870
[All]
Ohh!

58:44.870 --> 58:49.734
I know, I know. I feel like such a goon,
but I can't help it.

58:49.734 --> 58:52.614
- We have such a great time together.
- Who is it?

58:52.614 --> 58:54.534
Someone you guys don't know.

58:54.534 --> 58:56.454
That chick you left
the restaurant with that night.

58:56.454 --> 58:58.375
They're not from around here.

58:58.375 --> 59:00.294
Don't even tell me
you met her down the shore.

59:00.294 --> 59:02.150
Ew, a bridge-and-tunnel
Jersey dyke.

59:02.150 --> 59:05.031
- With huge hair and acid-washed jeans.
- [Laughs]

59:05.031 --> 59:08.871
For your information, they don't have
big hair or wear acid-wash.

59:08.871 --> 59:10.779
They're from my hometown.

59:15.591 --> 59:17.510
Why are you playing
the pronoun game?

59:17.510 --> 59:21.382
- What are you talking about? I'm not.
- You are.

59:21.382 --> 59:26.215
I met "someone." "We" have a great
time. "They're" from my hometown.

59:26.215 --> 59:29.063
Doesn't this tube
of wonderful have a name?

59:35.815 --> 59:37.724
Holden.

59:52.167 --> 59:54.076
[Sighs]
Well...

59:56.040 --> 59:57.927
here's to the both of you.

01:00:01.736 --> 01:00:04.605
Another one bites the dust.

01:00:12.296 --> 01:00:15.176
Can I ask you a question?

01:00:15.176 --> 01:00:19.006
Don't even tell me
you want to do it again.

01:00:20.936 --> 01:00:24.807
Why me?
You know? Why now?

01:00:24.807 --> 01:00:28.680
Well, because you were givin' me
that look and I got all wet.

01:00:28.680 --> 01:00:30.600
You know what I mean.

01:00:30.600 --> 01:00:33.480
Why not you?

01:00:33.480 --> 01:00:38.280
Well, I'm a guy. I mean...
you're attracted to girls.

01:00:38.280 --> 01:00:40.190
I see you've been
taking notes.

01:00:41.160 --> 01:00:44.040
Historically, yes.
That's true.

01:00:44.040 --> 01:00:46.910
Then why this?

01:00:50.760 --> 01:00:53.663
Well, I've given that
a lot of thought, you know.

01:00:54.632 --> 01:00:56.542
Now that I'm being ostracized
by my friends,

01:00:57.448 --> 01:00:58.396
I've had plenty of time
to think about it.

01:00:59.401 --> 01:01:02.249
And what I've come up with
is really simple.

01:01:03.241 --> 01:01:07.081
I came to this
on my own terms.

01:01:07.081 --> 01:01:09.961
You know, I didn't just
heed what I was taught:

01:01:09.961 --> 01:01:13.801
Men and women should be
together, it's the natural way,

01:01:13.801 --> 01:01:15.721
that kind of thing.

01:01:15.721 --> 01:01:19.561
I'm not with you because of
what family, society, life...

01:01:19.561 --> 01:01:22.431
tried to instill in me
from day one.

01:01:24.393 --> 01:01:27.273
The way the world is,

01:01:27.273 --> 01:01:32.104
how seldom it is that you meet
that one person who...

01:01:32.104 --> 01:01:34.025
just gets you.

01:01:34.025 --> 01:01:36.905
It's so rare.

01:01:36.905 --> 01:01:39.785
My parents didn't
really have it.

01:01:39.785 --> 01:01:45.544
There were no examples set for me in
the world of male-female relationships.

01:01:45.544 --> 01:01:49.385
And to cut oneself off
from finding that person...

01:01:49.385 --> 01:01:53.225
to immediately halve your options
by eliminating the possibility...

01:01:53.225 --> 01:01:57.034
of finding that one person
within your own gender...

01:01:57.034 --> 01:01:58.953
that just seemed stupid
to me.

01:01:58.953 --> 01:02:01.865
So I didn't.

01:02:01.865 --> 01:02:04.745
But then you came along.

01:02:04.745 --> 01:02:08.585
You, the one least likely.
I mean, you were a guy.

01:02:08.585 --> 01:02:11.465
[Chuckling]
Still am.

01:02:11.465 --> 01:02:16.266
And while I was falling for you
I put a ceiling on that,

01:02:16.266 --> 01:02:19.145
because you were a guy.

01:02:19.145 --> 01:02:23.946
Until I remembered why I opened the door
to women in the first place:

01:02:23.946 --> 01:02:27.818
To not limit the likelihood
of finding that one person who'd...

01:02:27.818 --> 01:02:30.688
complement me so completely.

01:02:34.570 --> 01:02:37.450
So, here we are.

01:02:37.450 --> 01:02:39.337
I was thorough
when I looked for you.

01:02:41.290 --> 01:02:45.130
And I feel justified
lying in your arms...

01:02:45.130 --> 01:02:48.970
'cause I got here
on my own terms,

01:02:48.970 --> 01:02:53.706
and I have no question there was
someplace I didn't look.

01:02:53.706 --> 01:02:56.576
For me that makes
all the difference.

01:03:12.010 --> 01:03:14.891
Can I at least tell people all you
needed was some serious deep-dicking?

01:03:14.891 --> 01:03:18.720
[Laughing]

01:03:21.611 --> 01:03:23.521
- Move!
- Stop!

01:03:36.042 --> 01:03:38.912
- What?
- Check out page 48.

01:03:50.412 --> 01:03:53.280
- So?
- Did you see the nickname?

01:03:55.211 --> 01:03:58.091
- "Finger Cuffs."
- And?

01:03:58.091 --> 01:04:02.923
- Weird nickname. What's your point?
- Do you know why it's "Finger Cuffs"?

01:04:02.923 --> 01:04:05.792
- No. I suppose you do.
- I do.

01:04:08.683 --> 01:04:12.556
Remember Cohee Lundin? Left Hudson
and went to North our senior year?

01:04:12.556 --> 01:04:14.476
Yeah.

01:04:14.476 --> 01:04:17.356
Well, asshole, I ran into him
at the stores the other day.

01:04:17.356 --> 01:04:20.235
God, it's been ages
since I've seen him.

01:04:20.235 --> 01:04:23.105
- Mentioned you were dating Alyssa.
- Did you?

01:04:24.076 --> 01:04:25.996
Yeah. Funny thing is,
you know what he said?

01:04:25.996 --> 01:04:30.828
Shit, I know Alyssa Jones.
I mean, I know Alyssa Jones.

01:04:30.828 --> 01:04:34.668
Me and Rick Derris used to hang
around her house after school...

01:04:34.668 --> 01:04:36.577
and shit, 'cause her parents were,
like, never home and shit, right?

01:04:37.548 --> 01:04:39.468
But one day Rick whips it out and
starts rubbin' it on her leg and shit,

01:04:39.468 --> 01:04:42.381
chasin' her around the living room;
I was dyin'.

01:04:42.381 --> 01:04:44.301
You know what the crazy bitch did?
She fuckin' drops to her knees...

01:04:44.301 --> 01:04:47.116
and starts suckin' him off right in
front of me, like I wasn't even there.

01:04:47.116 --> 01:04:49.996
I almost died.
But that's not the fucked-up part.

01:04:49.996 --> 01:04:53.836
The fucked-up part was Rick, right
in the middle of it, pointin' at her,

01:04:53.836 --> 01:04:55.756
and he says "Cohee,"
just like that, "Cohee."

01:04:55.756 --> 01:04:57.677
So I'm like, "Yo,
I'll give it a shot."

01:04:57.677 --> 01:05:00.556
I start pullin' her pants down and shit,
all slow 'cause I figure any second...

01:05:00.556 --> 01:05:02.508
she's gonna turn around
and belt me in the mouth, right?

01:05:02.508 --> 01:05:06.348
But she's all into it, man!
She don't try to stop me or nothin'!

01:05:06.348 --> 01:05:09.228
She's all wet and I just start goin'
to work, you know what I'm sayin'?

01:05:09.228 --> 01:05:11.149
Me and Rick are goin' to town on
this crazy bitch, and she's lovin' it,

01:05:11.149 --> 01:05:13.068
all moaning and shit.

01:05:13.068 --> 01:05:15.021
It was fucked-up. So Rick
came up with the nickname.

01:05:15.021 --> 01:05:19.821
That day she had us locked in from
both sides like Chinese finger cuffs.

01:05:19.821 --> 01:05:20.781
He's full of shit.

01:05:20.781 --> 01:05:23.661

and left to have sex with him
and Gwen Turner in the back of a limo.

01:15:51.159 --> 01:15:56.023
How about in college when I let Shannon
Hamilton videotape us having sex,

01:15:56.023 --> 01:16:00.823
only to find out he broadcast it
on the campus cable station.

01:16:00.823 --> 01:16:05.623
They're all true. Didn't you know?
I am the queen of suburban legend!

01:16:05.623 --> 01:16:07.544
Did you somehow fuckin' fail
to mention this to me?

01:16:07.544 --> 01:16:09.463
What the fuck's wrong with you?
How could you do all those things?

01:16:09.463 --> 01:16:11.383
Easily!

01:16:11.383 --> 01:16:16.183
Some I did out of stupidity, some
I did out of what I thought was love.

01:16:16.183 --> 01:16:19.063
But good or bad,
they are my choices,

01:16:19.063 --> 01:16:21.943
and I am not making
apologies for them now!

01:16:21.943 --> 01:16:24.846
Not to you,
or not to anyone!

01:16:25.848 --> 01:16:29.688
And how dare you lay a guilt trip on me
about it, in public, no less?

01:16:29.688 --> 01:16:33.529
Who the fuck do you think
you are, you judgmental prick?

01:16:33.529 --> 01:16:35.448
How the fuck am I supposed
to feel about all this?

01:16:35.448 --> 01:16:38.328
How are you supposed to
feel about it?

01:16:38.328 --> 01:16:41.198
Feel whatever the fuck you want
to about it, all right?

01:16:42.168 --> 01:16:45.997
The only thing that matters
is how you feel about me.

01:16:47.928 --> 01:16:49.848
- I don't know how I feel about you now.
- Why? Why?

01:16:49.848 --> 01:16:52.728
- Because I had some sex?
- Some sex?

01:16:52.728 --> 01:16:56.600
Yes, Holden.
That's all it was, some sex.

01:16:56.600 --> 01:16:59.513
Most of it
stupid high school sex.

01:16:59.513 --> 01:17:01.433
Like you never had sex
in high school.

01:17:01.433 --> 01:17:06.233
There is a world of fucking difference
between typical high school sex...

01:17:06.233 --> 01:17:10.073
and getting fucked by two fuckin' guys
at the same time!

01:17:10.073 --> 01:17:13.913
- They fuckin' used you.
- No! I used them!

01:17:13.913 --> 01:17:17.689
You don't think I would have let it
happen if I hadn't wanted to, do you?

01:17:17.689 --> 01:17:21.518
I was an experimental girl,
for Christ's sake!

01:17:22.489 --> 01:17:26.329
Maybe you knew early on
that your track was from point A to B,

01:17:26.329 --> 01:17:30.233
but, unlike you, I was not given
a fucking map at birth.

01:17:30.233 --> 01:17:32.153
So I tried it all.

01:17:32.153 --> 01:17:36.953
That is until we...
that's you and I... got together.

01:17:36.953 --> 01:17:39.833
And suddenly I was sated.

01:17:39.833 --> 01:17:43.673
Can't you take
some fucking comfort in that?

01:17:43.673 --> 01:17:47.514
[Sobbing] You turned out to be
all I was looking for,

01:17:47.514 --> 01:17:51.354
the missing piece
in the big fucking puzzle.

01:17:51.354 --> 01:17:54.224
[Sobbing]

01:17:56.154 --> 01:18:00.986
Look, I'm sorry I let you believe you
were the only guy I'd ever been with.

01:18:00.986 --> 01:18:03.897
I should have been
more honest.

01:18:03.897 --> 01:18:07.738
But it just didn't... It seemed
to make you feel special in a way...

01:18:07.738 --> 01:18:13.433
that me telling you over and over how
incredible you are wouldn't get across.

01:18:14.394 --> 01:18:17.274
Holden, I'm sorry.

01:18:17.274 --> 01:18:19.184
Just don't do that.

01:18:22.074 --> 01:18:26.874
Do you mean to tell me that,
while you have zero problem...

01:18:26.874 --> 01:18:29.776
with me sleeping with
half the women in New York City,

01:18:30.746 --> 01:18:33.657
you have some sort of half-assed,
mealy-mouthed objection...

01:18:33.657 --> 01:18:37.497
to pubescent antics that took place
almost ten years ago?

01:18:37.497 --> 01:18:40.345
What the fuck
is your problem?

01:18:42.298 --> 01:18:44.217
I want us to be something
that we can't be.

01:18:44.217 --> 01:18:46.138
And what's that?

01:18:46.138 --> 01:18:49.007
A normal couple.

01:18:49.978 --> 01:18:53.807
#So why don't you give
your little voice a rest #

01:18:54.778 --> 01:18:57.658
- [Screaming] Fuck!
- # Come on up inside my bed #

01:18:57.658 --> 01:19:00.560
#And just pretend you need me #

01:19:02.491 --> 01:19:07.322
# You don't have to lie
about what you know #

01:19:07.322 --> 01:19:08.283
# You don't have to lie
about what you know #

01:19:08.283 --> 01:19:12.025
#Even though
I've been sufferin'#

01:19:13.978 --> 01:19:17.818
#And I don't need to be
your only one #

01:19:17.818 --> 01:19:20.698
#I don't need your comforting #

01:19:20.698 --> 01:19:24.527
#I just need you with me #

01:19:26.458 --> 01:19:30.298
#Stay, stay, stay with me #

01:19:30.298 --> 01:19:35.121
#Stay, stay with me #

01:19:36.091 --> 01:19:38.043
#Stay and don't you ever
roll away from me #

01:19:38.043 --> 01:19:39.930
The girl?

01:19:41.883 --> 01:19:43.803
#Stay #

01:19:43.803 --> 01:19:48.604
#Stay with me #

01:19:48.604 --> 01:19:50.512
# Oh, and did she ever ##

01:19:56.283 --> 01:20:00.113
Well, look at this
morose motherfucker right here.

01:20:03.036 --> 01:20:05.916
Smells like someone shit
in his cereal. Nooch.

01:20:05.916 --> 01:20:08.732
What took you guys so long?
What are you, at the mall again?

01:20:08.732 --> 01:20:12.604
Bitch, don't even start, all right?
We stopped that shit years ago.

01:20:12.604 --> 01:20:14.523
Toss the salad.

01:20:14.523 --> 01:20:17.371
[Groans]

01:20:20.284 --> 01:20:23.153
Damn, this likeness rights shit
is more profitable than sellin' smoke.

01:20:25.084 --> 01:20:26.993
How did a dirt merchant like you
ever learn about likeness rights?

01:20:27.963 --> 01:20:30.844
We deal to a lot of lawyers.
You know what I'm sayin'?

01:20:30.844 --> 01:20:34.716
Speaking of which...
A little signin' bonus and shit?

01:20:34.716 --> 01:20:40.477
No, I'll pass.
Did you guys take a look at the issue?

01:20:40.477 --> 01:20:42.429
Yeah.

01:20:42.429 --> 01:20:47.228
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:20:47.228 --> 01:20:49.149
You need to throw some pussy
in that book, man.

01:20:49.149 --> 01:20:52.028
Like, throw some supervillain
with big fuckin' tits...

01:20:52.028 --> 01:20:54.908
that shoot milk or somethin',
and I'll just, like, suck her dry...

01:20:54.908 --> 01:20:56.818
and bust some moves
on her.

01:21:00.669 --> 01:21:04.540
Then she has to fuck me.
I mean, fuck us.

01:21:04.540 --> 01:21:06.395
I'll see what I can do.

01:21:08.317 --> 01:21:12.158
- All right, boys. What'll it be?
- I'm all set, thanks.

01:21:12.158 --> 01:21:16.029
Yo, Flo. Tell Mel to whip me up
a toasted bagel with cream cheese.

01:21:16.029 --> 01:21:20.786
You want one too? Make that two,
and kiss my grits. Nooch.

01:21:22.749 --> 01:21:26.589
Did you ever watch that show, Alice?
That show was funny as hell, man.

01:21:26.589 --> 01:21:30.429
So why the long face, horse?
Banky on the rag?

01:21:30.429 --> 01:21:34.269
I'm just, uh... I'm just havin'
a little girl trouble.

01:21:34.269 --> 01:21:36.221
Bitch pressin' charges?
I get that a lot.

01:21:36.221 --> 01:21:40.051
No. I'm just, uh...

01:21:41.021 --> 01:21:43.901
I'm just at a point where
I don't really know what to do.

01:21:43.901 --> 01:21:46.814
Kick her to the fuckin' curb.
Girls get to be too much trouble.

01:21:46.814 --> 01:21:50.611
There's always the band... of the hand.

01:21:51.614 --> 01:21:54.494
Can't do it, G.
I'm in love.

01:21:54.494 --> 01:21:58.334
Nah, there ain't no such thing. You
got to boil it down to the essentials.

01:21:58.334 --> 01:22:03.069
It's like Cube says: # Life ain't
nothin' but bitches and money ##

01:22:04.989 --> 01:22:07.901
Thanks, guys. That's just what I needed.
Advice from the 'hood.

01:22:07.901 --> 01:22:12.691
- So who is this girl?
- Oh, I don't think you know her.

01:22:13.662 --> 01:22:16.542
Come on, man.
I'm people who know people.

01:22:16.542 --> 01:22:18.494
You sound
like Barbra Streisand.

01:22:18.494 --> 01:22:21.374
Maybe 'cause I got this tubby bitch
playin' her greatest hits tape...

01:22:21.374 --> 01:22:23.295
in my ear all the time.

01:22:23.295 --> 01:22:27.135
You gotta see it. When she starts
singin' "You Don't Bring Me Flowers,"

01:22:27.135 --> 01:22:30.015
this faggot starts cryin' like a little
girl with a skinned knee and shit.

01:22:30.015 --> 01:22:33.855
Big fuckin' softie.
So what's the skirt's name?

01:22:33.855 --> 01:22:36.735
I'm tellin' ya, man.
You don't know the girl.

01:22:36.735 --> 01:22:40.597
I ain't playin', man.
Come on, tell me her name, Mysterio.

01:22:42.526 --> 01:22:44.436
Alyssa Jones.

01:22:46.367 --> 01:22:49.278
Holy fuckin' shit.
Finger Cuffs?

01:22:49.278 --> 01:22:53.075
You're dating Finger Cuffs,
you silly son of a bitch?

01:22:54.078 --> 01:22:55.998
Wait a second.
I thought she was all gay and shit.

01:22:55.998 --> 01:22:58.878
She was, or she is.
I don't know.

01:22:58.878 --> 01:23:01.695
And you're dating her.
Man, you're a lucky fuck.

01:23:01.695 --> 01:23:03.615
She ever bring bitches to bed
with you?

01:23:03.615 --> 01:23:05.535
Get a little of that
Filet-O-Fish sandwich goin' on?

01:23:05.535 --> 01:23:08.447
Yeah, you know what
I'm talkin' about, baby. Right?

01:23:08.447 --> 01:23:12.287
What's up? Yeah.
So four tits and what?

01:23:12.287 --> 01:23:15.167
- No, man. It's not like that.
- What's it like, then?

01:23:15.167 --> 01:23:19.007
Right now?
I don't know.

01:23:19.007 --> 01:23:21.918
I love her, you know?
But, uh, she has a past.

01:23:21.918 --> 01:23:25.758
I'll say. Stuffin' two guys,
eatin' chicks out and shit.

01:23:25.758 --> 01:23:28.639
You know, I heard
one time she had this dog...

01:23:28.639 --> 01:23:31.519
Eat your fuckin' bagel already
and shut up.

01:23:31.519 --> 01:23:35.359
Look at this touchy
motherfucker right here.

01:23:35.359 --> 01:23:38.239
So if you're all in love and shit,
what's the problem?

01:23:38.239 --> 01:23:41.152
The problem is
stupid shit like that.

01:23:41.152 --> 01:23:43.071
It was bad enough when it was
just girls, you know?

01:23:43.071 --> 01:23:46.912
You throw guys into the mix...
two guys at once, no less...

01:23:46.912 --> 01:23:49.791
All that experience, you know?
What am I supposed to think?

01:23:49.791 --> 01:23:54.624
Think "good," ya fuckin' ninny shithead,
'cause now she'll be all true and blue.

01:23:54.624 --> 01:23:59.359
Bitch tasted life. Now she's settlin'
for your borin' funny-book-makin' ass.

01:23:59.359 --> 01:24:02.206
Settling for my boring ass.
That's comforting. Thanks, Jay.

01:24:03.199 --> 01:24:07.999
- That's what I'm here for.
- I'm just havin' a problem with it.

01:24:07.999 --> 01:24:11.872
It's like I can't get these visuals out
of my head of her doing all this shit.

01:24:11.872 --> 01:24:15.712
And I don't know why I can't let
it go, 'cause I'm crazy about this girl.

01:24:15.712 --> 01:24:19.552
- I look at her, I see kids, grandkids...
- You're scarin' me.

01:24:19.552 --> 01:24:22.432
Yeah, well, I'm scarin' myself
'cause I think so much of this girl...

01:24:22.432 --> 01:24:25.302
that I can't get stupid shit
like "Finger Cuffs" out of my head.

01:24:27.264 --> 01:24:30.111
[Sighs] I don't know.
I don't know what I'm doin'.

01:24:33.984 --> 01:24:35.893
Chasin' Amy.

01:24:37.824 --> 01:24:40.705
What?
What did you say?

01:24:40.705 --> 01:24:42.656
[Spits]

01:24:42.656 --> 01:24:45.536
- You're chasing Amy.
- What do you look so shocked for, man?

01:24:45.536 --> 01:24:49.376
Fat bastard does this all the time. He
thinks 'cause he don't say anything...

01:24:49.376 --> 01:24:52.256
it'll have some huge impact
when he does open his fuckin' mouth.

01:24:52.256 --> 01:24:54.176
Jesus Christ,
why don't you shut up?

01:24:54.176 --> 01:24:58.944
Always yap-yap-yapping all the time.
Give me a fuckin' headache.

01:24:58.944 --> 01:25:00.832
I went through somethin' like what
you're talkin' about a couple years ago.

01:25:01.825 --> 01:25:03.711
- This chick named Amy.
- When?

01:25:04.705 --> 01:25:06.592
A couple of years ago.

01:25:07.585 --> 01:25:09.504
What, she live in Canada or something?
Why don't I remember this?

01:25:09.504 --> 01:25:11.425
Bitch, what you don't
know about me...

01:25:11.425 --> 01:25:13.376
I could just about squeeze
in the Grand-fucking-Canyon.

01:25:13.376 --> 01:25:17.216
Did you know I always wanted to be
a dancer in Vegas? Huh?

01:25:17.216 --> 01:25:21.057
Bet you didn't even know
that shit, did you?

01:25:21.057 --> 01:25:23.926
Just tell your fuckin' story so
we can get out of here and smoke this.

01:25:25.857 --> 01:25:30.689
So there's me and Amy. And we're
inseparable. Just big-time in love.

01:25:30.689 --> 01:25:33.569
Then four months down the road
the idiot gear kicks in,

01:25:33.569 --> 01:25:36.449
and I ask about the ex-boyfriend which,
as we all know, is a really dumb move.

01:25:36.449 --> 01:25:40.289
But you know how it is: You don't want
to know, but you just have to know.

01:25:40.289 --> 01:25:42.210
Stupid guy bullshit.

01:25:42.210 --> 01:25:44.161
So, anyway, she starts
tellin' me about him.

01:25:44.161 --> 01:25:47.991
They fell in love, went out for
a couple of years, lived together.

01:25:48.961 --> 01:25:51.842
Her mother likes me better,
blah, blah, blah, blah. And I'm okay.

01:25:51.842 --> 01:25:54.711
But then she drops the bomb on me,
and the bomb is this;

01:25:55.681 --> 01:25:58.562
It seems that a couple of times,
while they were goin' out,

01:25:58.562 --> 01:26:00.481
he brought some people
to bed with them.

01:26:00.481 --> 01:26:03.394
Menage a trois,
I believe it's called.

01:26:03.394 --> 01:26:06.274
Now this just blows my mind, right?
I'm not used to this sort of thing.

01:26:06.274 --> 01:26:11.074
- I was raised Catholic, for God's sakes.
- Saint Shithead.

01:26:11.074 --> 01:26:12.994
Do somethin'.

01:26:12.994 --> 01:26:15.906
So I'm totally weirded out by this,
right? And I just start blastin' her.

01:26:15.906 --> 01:26:18.786
I don't know how to deal with what I'm
feelin', so I figure the best way is...

01:26:18.786 --> 01:26:21.666
if call her "slut," right,
and tell her she was used.

01:26:21.666 --> 01:26:24.546
I'm out for blood.
I really want to hurt this girl.

01:26:24.546 --> 01:26:28.387
"What the fuck is your problem?"
And she's just calmly trying to tell me,

01:26:28.387 --> 01:26:32.226
"It was that time, that place," and she
doesn't think she should apologize...

01:26:32.226 --> 01:26:34.178
because she doesn't feel
that she's done anything wrong.

01:26:34.178 --> 01:26:38.935
I'm like, "Oh, really?" I look her in
the eye and tell her it's over. I walk.

01:26:40.898 --> 01:26:42.818
Fuckin' A.

01:26:42.818 --> 01:26:45.731
No, idiot.
It was a mistake.

01:26:45.731 --> 01:26:47.650
I wasn't disgusted with her,
I was afraid.

01:26:47.650 --> 01:26:51.426
You know, at that moment I felt small,
like I'd lacked experience,

01:26:51.426 --> 01:26:55.267
like I'd never be on her level, never be
enough for her or something like that.

01:26:55.267 --> 01:26:59.107
But what I did not get,
she didn't care.

01:26:59.107 --> 01:27:02.947
She wasn't lookin' for that guy anymore,
she was lookin' for me, for the Bob.

01:27:02.947 --> 01:27:08.739
But by the time I figured this all
out, it's too late, man. She moved on.

01:27:08.739 --> 01:27:11.585
All I had to show for it was foolish
pride which then gave way to regret.

01:27:13.539 --> 01:27:17.411
She was the girl.
I know that now.

01:27:17.411 --> 01:27:20.281
But...

01:27:22.212 --> 01:27:24.121
I pushed her away.

01:27:29.892 --> 01:27:34.681
So I've spent every day
since then chasing Amy.

01:27:36.612 --> 01:27:38.563
So to speak.

01:27:38.563 --> 01:27:42.361
Enough of this fuckin' melodrama.
My advice? Forget her, dude.

01:27:43.363 --> 01:27:47.203
There's one bitch in the world,
one bitch with many faces.

01:27:47.203 --> 01:27:51.971
Get up, tons of fun.
We gotta book.

01:27:51.971 --> 01:27:54.852
- Catchin'a bus to Chi-town.
- Why? What's there?

01:27:54.852 --> 01:27:58.691
Business, yo. How many more of those
fat envelopes we get comin' to us?

01:27:58.691 --> 01:28:01.572
Uh, I don't know.

01:28:01.572 --> 01:28:04.452
I don't know how much longer
the book's gonna be around.

01:28:04.452 --> 01:28:07.332
Yeah, good.
I'll be glad as shit when it's gone.

01:28:07.332 --> 01:28:11.204
There's a million people who'd love
to see themself in a comic book.

01:28:11.204 --> 01:28:14.084
But that ain't like us at all,
all slapsticky and shit,

01:28:14.084 --> 01:28:15.011
runnin' around like
a couple of dickheads.

01:28:16.004 --> 01:28:17.891
Sayin'... What's that shit
he got us sayin'?

01:28:18.915 --> 01:28:21.795
Oh, um...
"snootchie-bootchies."

01:28:21.795 --> 01:28:26.585
"Snootchie-bootchies." Who the fuck
talks like that? That is baby talk.

01:28:28.515 --> 01:28:31.396
It's a big world, G.
We're bound to run into you again.

01:28:31.396 --> 01:28:35.236
- Till then, keep your unit on ya.
- I'll try.

01:28:35.236 --> 01:28:39.075
No, no, no, no, no.
Do or do not. There is no try...

01:28:39.075 --> 01:28:42.949
Knock that shit off!
We got a bus to catch.

01:28:42.949 --> 01:28:46.725
Jedi bitch. Man, what do you always have
to tell that fuckin' gay story for?

01:28:46.725 --> 01:28:48.611
- Man, shut up.
- You shut up, you fat fuck.

01:29:35.781 --> 01:29:37.701
Okay.

01:29:37.701 --> 01:29:42.501
You guys are probably wondering
why I asked you here at the same time...

01:29:42.501 --> 01:29:46.309
knowing that we have shit
to settle between us separately.

01:29:46.309 --> 01:29:49.189
I just figured you wanted
to kill two birds with one stone.

01:29:49.189 --> 01:29:52.101
You know, by telling her
to fuck off with me here...

01:29:52.101 --> 01:29:54.022
so you wouldn't have to
go through the story again later on.

01:29:54.022 --> 01:29:57.862
- Fuck you.
- Not even if you let me videotape it.

01:29:57.862 --> 01:30:00.731
Okay, enough.
All right?

01:30:01.701 --> 01:30:04.582
Enough.
[Sighs]

01:30:04.582 --> 01:30:08.422
Now, I've been going over and
over and over this whole thing,

01:30:08.422 --> 01:30:11.302
and I've dissected it
a thousand different ways.

01:30:11.302 --> 01:30:15.142
Banky, there's tension between you and I
for the first time in our lives.

01:30:15.142 --> 01:30:19.973
You hate me dating Alyssa and you want
me to sign off on this cartoon thing.

01:30:19.973 --> 01:30:21.893
How perceptive.

01:30:21.893 --> 01:30:25.766
Alyssa,

01:30:25.766 --> 01:30:27.686
you and I have hit a wall...

01:30:27.686 --> 01:30:32.486
'cause I don't know how to deal
with your, uh, your past, I guess.

01:30:32.486 --> 01:30:34.407
That's a nice way
of putting it.

01:30:34.407 --> 01:30:36.315
I'd have said
"the whole double stuff" thing.

01:30:42.022 --> 01:30:45.851
I'm only gonna
tell you this once: Shut up.

01:30:47.782 --> 01:30:49.734
Now,
[Sighs]

01:30:49.734 --> 01:30:53.564
I know I'm to blame one way
or another on both accounts.

01:30:54.567 --> 01:30:58.407
Alyssa, with you
because... I feel inadequate,

01:30:58.407 --> 01:31:01.287
because you've had such a big life
and so much experience,

01:31:01.287 --> 01:31:04.167
and my life's been
pretty small in comparison.

01:31:04.167 --> 01:31:07.046
- That doesn't matter to me.
- Please.

01:31:07.046 --> 01:31:09.927
I have to get
through this, okay?

01:31:09.927 --> 01:31:14.727
Banky, I know why you're having such
a hard time with me and Alyssa.

01:31:14.727 --> 01:31:17.607
It's something that's been
obvious forever and I guess...

01:31:17.607 --> 01:31:20.477
I guess I just didn't
acknowledge it.

01:31:22.439 --> 01:31:24.327
You're in love with me.

01:31:26.311 --> 01:31:28.232
What?

01:31:28.232 --> 01:31:33.031
You're attracted to me. Just as, in
a way, I guess I'm... attracted to you.

01:31:33.031 --> 01:31:35.912
It makes sense. We've been together
so long, we have so much in common.

01:31:35.912 --> 01:31:38.727
Well, I gotta get goin'.

01:31:38.727 --> 01:31:40.637
I gotta catch the last few minutes
of Little House.

01:31:49.287 --> 01:31:51.197
It's somethin' you're
gonna have to deal with, Bank.

01:31:53.127 --> 01:31:55.080
And that would explain
your jealousy of Alyssa,

01:31:55.080 --> 01:31:57.992
your homophobia,
your sense of humor...

01:31:57.992 --> 01:32:00.872
Jesus, just 'cause a guy's
got a predilection toward dick jokes...

01:32:00.872 --> 01:32:02.759
Bank. Stop.

01:32:03.752 --> 01:32:06.621
Deal with it.
You'll feel much better.

01:32:08.552 --> 01:32:10.461
[Holden]
Okay.

01:32:15.272 --> 01:32:19.112
Now, you guys are probably
asking yourselves the same question...

01:32:19.112 --> 01:32:22.952
that I've been going over and over
in my head the past few weeks:

01:32:22.952 --> 01:32:24.873
What does one have
to do with the other?

01:32:24.873 --> 01:32:25.864
Don't.

01:32:25.864 --> 01:32:29.736
And when I did some
serious soul-searching,

01:32:29.736 --> 01:32:31.656
it came to me
from outta nowhere.

01:32:31.656 --> 01:32:37.352
And it all made sense.
And a calm came over me.

01:32:37.352 --> 01:32:40.232
I know what we have to do.

01:32:40.232 --> 01:32:44.072
And then you, Banky,
you, Alyssa, and I...

01:32:44.072 --> 01:32:48.873
all of us...
can finally be... all right.

01:32:48.873 --> 01:32:50.782
Please don't say it.

01:32:53.673 --> 01:32:56.542
We've all gotta
have sex together.

01:33:05.257 --> 01:33:07.176
I mean, look,
don't you see?

01:33:07.176 --> 01:33:11.016
That would take care
of everything.

01:33:11.016 --> 01:33:13.896
Alyssa, with you, I won't feel
too inadequate or conservative anymore,

01:33:13.896 --> 01:33:16.777
because I'll have done something
on a par with all your experience.

01:33:16.777 --> 01:33:21.577
And it will be with you, which will
make it that much more powerful.

01:33:21.577 --> 01:33:23.497
Banky, you can take that leap...

01:33:23.497 --> 01:33:25.417
that everyone else but you
sees you should take.

01:33:25.417 --> 01:33:29.290
And it'll be with me,
your best friend for years.

01:33:29.290 --> 01:33:31.241
We've been everything to each other
but intimates,

01:33:31.241 --> 01:33:33.129
and now we'll have been
through that together too.

01:33:34.057 --> 01:33:35.977
And it won't be a total leap for you
because a woman will be involved.

01:33:35.977 --> 01:33:39.774
And when it's over, all that hostility
you feel toward Alyssa will be gone...

01:33:40.777 --> 01:33:42.697
because you'll have shared in something
beautiful with the woman I love.

01:33:42.697 --> 01:33:45.577
It'll be cathartic.

01:33:45.577 --> 01:33:48.447
This will keep us together.

01:33:52.298 --> 01:33:53.246
[Exhales]

01:33:58.057 --> 01:33:59.999

01:34:05.802 --> 01:34:07.689
[Exhales]

01:34:14.442 --> 01:34:16.351
Sure.

01:34:30.794 --> 01:34:33.642
You know I need this.

01:34:33.642 --> 01:34:36.522
You know it'll help.

01:34:36.522 --> 01:34:38.442
No.

01:34:38.442 --> 01:34:41.289
[Sighs]
Thank Christ.

01:34:43.242 --> 01:34:46.112
Sorry.

01:34:50.922 --> 01:34:54.762
No? I thought
you'd be into this.

01:34:54.762 --> 01:34:59.563
You did?
What does that say about me?

01:34:59.563 --> 01:35:02.475
Sweetheart, you've done stuff
like this before.

01:35:02.475 --> 01:35:04.394
This should be
no big deal for you.

01:35:04.394 --> 01:35:08.224
You don't want this.
You really don't want this.

01:35:09.227 --> 01:35:14.027
No, I do want this. This has
to happen. Can't you see that?

01:35:14.027 --> 01:35:18.827
I mean, how can you not? No?
What does that say about me?

01:35:18.827 --> 01:35:20.747
You can take it from two guys
whose names you can hardly remember,

01:35:20.747 --> 01:35:25.547
but I ask you to share an experience
about intimacy, and you say no?

01:35:25.547 --> 01:35:29.388
- I can't.
- Baby, yes, you can.

01:35:29.388 --> 01:35:33.259
I'll be there. And when it's over we'll
be the strongest we've ever been...

01:35:33.259 --> 01:35:35.179
'cause we'll have been
through this together.

01:35:35.179 --> 01:35:39.051
Then we'll be on the same level and
there'll be nothing we can't accomplish.

01:35:39.051 --> 01:35:42.849
[Crying]
Oh, Holden.

01:35:44.812 --> 01:35:46.732
That time is over for me.

01:35:46.732 --> 01:35:48.652
I've been there
and I've done it...

01:35:48.652 --> 01:35:52.492
and I didn't find
what I was looking for in any of it.

01:35:52.492 --> 01:35:56.333
I found that it you.
In us.

01:35:56.333 --> 01:36:00.172
Doing this won't help you forget
about the things you're hung up on.

01:36:00.172 --> 01:36:04.044
- It'll create more.
- No. I've thought about all that.

01:36:04.044 --> 01:36:06.914
Yes, it will!

01:36:09.836 --> 01:36:13.676
[Sobs] Maybe you'll see me
differently from then on.

01:36:13.676 --> 01:36:19.435
Maybe you'll despise me for going along
with it once you're in the moment.

01:36:19.435 --> 01:36:21.356
Maybe I'll moan differently,

01:36:21.356 --> 01:36:25.196
and then you'll resent Banky
and become suspicious of us.

01:36:25.196 --> 01:36:28.013
Or you'll alienate him
because of it.

01:36:28.013 --> 01:36:32.812
You'll grow to blame and hate me for
the deterioration of your friendship.

01:36:32.812 --> 01:36:36.685
Or what if... and God,
I sincerely doubt it...

01:36:36.685 --> 01:36:40.525
but what if I saw something
in Banky that I've never seen before,

01:36:40.525 --> 01:36:44.354
you know, and I fell in love
with him and left you?

01:36:45.356 --> 01:36:49.196
I've been down roads
like this before.

01:36:49.196 --> 01:36:51.084
Many times.

01:36:53.997 --> 01:36:58.796
I know you feel doing this
will broaden your horizons...

01:36:58.796 --> 01:37:01.676
and give you experience.

01:37:01.676 --> 01:37:06.509
But I've had
those experiences, on my own.

01:37:06.509 --> 01:37:10.350
And I can't accompany you
on yours.

01:37:10.350 --> 01:37:12.259
I'm past that now.

[Sighing]

01:37:18.061 --> 01:37:21.901
Or maybe I just love you
too much.

01:37:21.901 --> 01:37:26.635
And I feel hurt and let down that you
would want to share me with anyone.

01:37:27.597 --> 01:37:31.427

want to share you.

a part of this.

01:38:01.262 --> 01:38:04.132
Know that.

01:38:09.933 --> 01:38:12.803

your fucking whore.

[Woman's Voice Over P.A.,

- There was going to be.
- What happened?

with you and Holden McNeil?

01:39:48.880 --> 01:39:50.799
So, you guys don't
talk anymore?

01:39:50.799 --> 01:39:54.671
No. Not really.

01:39:54.671 --> 01:39:58.512
Yeah. That happened to me once.
Me and this guy started a comic club.

01:39:58.512 --> 01:40:03.311
And we got into a fight over who looked
better in bare legs, Electra or Robin.

01:40:03.311 --> 01:40:09.072
Anyway, I disbanded the club and struck
out on my own, kinda like Nomad.

01:40:09.072 --> 01:40:12.944
I'm rambling on now.
What I meant to say is...

01:40:12.944 --> 01:40:14.864
that you probably shouldn't
have killed off Chronic.

01:40:14.864 --> 01:40:19.600
Guess not. Some doors just
shouldn't be opened.

01:40:19.600 --> 01:40:22.480
Oh, like the door to death
in Baby Dave's Winter Special,

01:40:22.480 --> 01:40:24.400
which you did on your own.

01:40:24.400 --> 01:40:28.271
See? You don't need that McNeil guy,
anyway. You do great work on your own.

01:40:28.271 --> 01:40:32.112
Look at your line work. Look at all the
detail in this douche bag on page 18.

01:40:32.112 --> 01:40:34.032
Look at how you draw a fart.

01:40:34.032 --> 01:40:36.912
And tell me you're not better off
without Holden McNeil.

01:40:36.912 --> 01:40:39.792
I mean, you were just carrying
that guy like a brown-bag lunch,

01:40:39.792 --> 01:40:41.711
you know what I'm saying?

01:40:41.711 --> 01:40:45.585
- You're so right.
- Yeah, well, the true fans always are.

01:40:45.585 --> 01:40:50.374
Well, keep up the good work, man.
Love those dick jokes. Love 'em.

01:40:52.305 --> 01:40:54.214
See ya.

01:40:57.136 --> 01:40:59.024
Yeah.

01:41:00.976 --> 01:41:02.864
Bye.

01:41:13.457 --> 01:41:16.304
Okay. Who's next?

01:41:17.265 --> 01:41:19.175
Hi.

01:41:25.906 --> 01:41:27.815
Thanks for readin' it.

01:41:28.786 --> 01:41:31.697
I can't believe this place.
These people are so weird.

01:41:31.697 --> 01:41:33.617
You wanted to come.

01:41:33.617 --> 01:41:35.537
God, I can't believe you call
these people contemporaries.

01:41:35.537 --> 01:41:38.417
Look at this guy over here
with the pointy ears? What's that?

01:41:38.417 --> 01:41:40.337
- He's a Vulcan.
- A what?

01:41:40.337 --> 01:41:42.257
- A Vulcan. Jesus, potzer.
- [Laughs]

01:41:42.257 --> 01:41:45.137
Why don't you take a walk
and get us something to drink?

01:41:45.137 --> 01:41:46.120
Okay, I will.

01:42:04.402 --> 01:42:06.322
Um, this isn't
one of mine.

01:42:06.322 --> 01:42:08.209
It's mine.

01:42:10.162 --> 01:42:11.984
I saved you a copy.

01:42:14.898 --> 01:42:16.851
Hi.

01:42:16.851 --> 01:42:18.770
Hi.

01:42:18.770 --> 01:42:20.691
How've you been?

01:42:20.691 --> 01:42:25.490
Uh, good. Really good.
Yourself?

01:42:25.490 --> 01:42:27.400
Good.

01:42:34.162 --> 01:42:37.043
The new issue's selling
like crazy, for some reason.

01:42:37.043 --> 01:42:40.883
Yeah, well, it's because it's
really good. I liked it a lot.

01:42:40.883 --> 01:42:42.770
Thank you.

01:42:44.722 --> 01:42:47.634
I haven't even seen this yet.
Did it just come out?

01:42:47.634 --> 01:42:51.474
Uh, oh, about a month ago.
I did a really small run.

01:42:51.474 --> 01:42:53.395
Self-financed,
only about 500 issues.

01:42:53.395 --> 01:42:56.264
Will I enjoy it?

01:42:57.235 --> 01:42:59.144
You might.
It's familiar subject matter.

01:43:16.404 --> 01:43:20.266
Looks like
a very personal story.

01:43:23.155 --> 01:43:26.985
[Sighs] I finally had
something personal to say.

01:43:31.795 --> 01:43:34.675
Well, I'm gonna go.
I don't wanna hold up your line here.

01:43:34.675 --> 01:43:37.555
Yeah.

01:43:37.555 --> 01:43:41.428
I mean, it can get ugly. I just saw
this nun call a small child a cunt-rag.

01:43:41.428 --> 01:43:43.316
[Chuckles]

01:43:49.108 --> 01:43:52.020
You know, read that,
if you have a minute.

01:43:52.020 --> 01:43:53.929
I will.

01:43:57.780 --> 01:44:02.580
If you get the chance, call me. I'd like
to hear your thoughts, or... whatever.

01:44:02.580 --> 01:44:05.449
Okay.

01:44:06.388 --> 01:44:08.276
Okay.

01:44:11.188 --> 01:44:13.108
It was really nice
seeing you again.

01:44:13.108 --> 01:44:15.955
It was really nice
to see you too.

01:44:29.460 --> 01:44:32.340
- Who was that?
- Huh?

01:44:32.340 --> 01:44:34.250
Who was that?

01:44:43.893 --> 01:44:47.689
Oh, just some guy I knew.

01:45:00.245 --> 01:45:04.075
Next. So, what do you want
to do tonight?

01:45:05.045 --> 01:45:10.806
#I was tappin'my foot
on a Friday night #

01:45:10.806 --> 01:45:15.637
# To my favorite band
I was pushed aside #

01:45:15.637 --> 01:45:20.437
#I said hey, don't push me
No, no, no one pushes me #

01:45:20.437 --> 01:45:25.269
# When I was face to face
with a woman I admired #

01:45:25.269 --> 01:45:27.188
#And she gave me this look

01:45:27.188 --> 01:45:28.149
#And she gave me this look

01:45:28.149 --> 01:45:30.069
I could not believe #

01:45:30.069 --> 01:45:34.859
#And the cold stare remained
I wanted to leave #

01:45:36.789 --> 01:45:41.579
# Yeah, I do believe anger
is offset by sorrow #

01:45:42.549 --> 01:45:46.422
#But you destroy today
you might regret tomorrow #

01:45:46.422 --> 01:45:49.302
# When you're young
and defensive #

01:45:49.302 --> 01:45:51.222
#It comes off offensive #

01:45:51.222 --> 01:45:56.054
#And it's hard to repay the
tolerance that you borrowed #

01:45:56.054 --> 01:46:01.750
# The lasting relationship
sinks right off the pier #

01:46:01.750 --> 01:46:05.579
# Who wears the pants
It's faded but clear #

01:46:08.470 --> 01:46:12.310
#She's your girlfriend
and she ain't too fond of me #

01:46:12.310 --> 01:46:18.103
#I guess if that's the way
it was meant to be #

01:46:18.103 --> 01:46:22.902
# There we were
just we three #

01:46:22.902 --> 01:46:26.732
# You, your girlfriend and me #

01:46:48.855 --> 01:46:53.687
#I've known you forever
You two just met #

01:46:53.687 --> 01:46:57.559
#So easily amused
how fast we forget #

01:46:57.559 --> 01:47:02.294
#Ain't my jealousy
my self-righteous greed #

01:47:03.255 --> 01:47:07.095
#She's a bit like a book
I'm too farsighted to read #

01:47:07.095 --> 01:47:11.895
#And I wish you the best
but sometimes feel the need #

01:47:11.895 --> 01:47:16.684
# To say
Remember me #

01:47:18.615 --> 01:47:23.404
# Yeah, she's your girlfriend
as far as we can see #

01:47:24.407 --> 01:47:28.237
#Does she look at you
the way she looks at me #

01:47:29.240 --> 01:47:34.039
#And here we are
just we three #

01:47:34.039 --> 01:47:37.869
# You, your girlfriend and me #

01:47:39.800 --> 01:47:44.599
#She's your girlfriend
it's gettin'harder to see #

01:47:44.599 --> 01:47:49.400
#Betterjust take her home
Betterjust let her be #

01:47:49.400 --> 01:47:54.189
# When she walks out that door
you come looking for me ##

01:48:07.640 --> 01:48:10.520
[Jay] Man, what do you always have
to tell that fuckin'gay story for?

01:48:10.520 --> 01:48:13.390
- [Silent Bob] Man, shut up.
- You shut up, you fat fuck.
