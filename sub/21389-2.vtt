WEBVTT

00:05.539 --> 00:08.295
- You meet your neighbors yet?
- Lemuel Bridger.

00:08.318 --> 00:10.414
- What are you?
- Vampire's one word for it.

00:10.449 --> 00:12.669
Olivia, she's got more
secrets than anyone.

00:12.705 --> 00:15.699
Joe, you can always
count on him to help.

00:15.734 --> 00:17.737
The Rev, he's obsessed
with his pet cemetery.

00:17.772 --> 00:19.260
Aubrey, marry me.

00:19.295 --> 00:20.413
- Yes, I'll marry you!
- Yes?

00:21.126 --> 00:21.981
Aubrey Hamilton,

00:22.016 --> 00:22.581
she's definitely dead.

00:22.616 --> 00:24.211
The veil between the living

00:24.247 --> 00:26.043
and the dead is awful thin here.

00:26.078 --> 00:29.222
Aubrey, what is it
you need to tell me?

00:29.258 --> 00:30.645
Pecados?

00:33.060 --> 00:34.822
Hey, we got something!

00:34.857 --> 00:36.171
Aubrey wasn't who you thought.

00:36.206 --> 00:38.568
She was married.
Name's Peter Lowry.

00:38.603 --> 00:40.285
If you were gonna kiss me,
now would be a good time.

00:40.309 --> 00:41.813
You're under arrest
for the murder

00:41.848 --> 00:43.270
of Aubrey HamiltonLowry.

00:43.305 --> 00:44.555
- I did not kill her!
- She's a witch.

00:44.579 --> 00:45.908
Tomorrow's a full moon.

00:45.942 --> 00:47.102
I'll be unavailable
for a few days.

00:47.126 --> 00:48.372
I'll help.

00:50.000 --> 00:56.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:57.637 --> 00:59.357
Here.

01:02.779 --> 01:05.599
I think we lost it.

01:05.634 --> 01:06.633
How bad is it?

01:10.503 --> 01:13.065
My... it's not that bad.

01:13.100 --> 01:15.818
- Never play poker.
- Sorry, sorry.

01:15.896 --> 01:18.766
I just need to apply pressure.

01:18.801 --> 01:20.348
Does that hurt?

01:20.383 --> 01:21.765
- Less so at the moment.
- Well, good.

01:21.789 --> 01:24.058
It's the least I can do.

01:24.094 --> 01:25.032
Just so you know,
once I'm not bleeding,

01:25.068 --> 01:26.930
I'll try for that kiss again.

01:26.965 --> 01:29.568
Well, just so you know,
a little blood doesn't scare me.

01:38.008 --> 01:40.037
- Take this.
- What?

01:40.073 --> 01:41.801
Nothing with bullets?
I'm new to Texas.

01:48.504 --> 01:50.191
Where is...

01:53.339 --> 01:55.709
- Any ideas, Grandma?
- Grandma?

01:55.744 --> 01:57.539
She's dead. I see her.

01:57.575 --> 02:00.403
Stop talking and run.

02:28.502 --> 02:34.042
Bad night?

02:34.077 --> 02:36.372
"Go to Midnight," you said.

02:36.407 --> 02:39.044
"Small, out of the way place.

02:39.079 --> 02:43.089
Nice folks.
Just lay low, work, make money."

02:43.124 --> 02:47.250
- So that's a "yes."
- That house is infested.

02:47.285 --> 02:50.071
Ghosts and whatever the hell's
growling in there.

02:50.107 --> 02:51.863
And I just promised
the town I'd help with...

02:55.484 --> 02:58.719
Hightower's been calling
all night.

02:58.753 --> 03:01.638
Remember what you used to say?

03:01.717 --> 03:02.372
When the going gets tough...

03:02.407 --> 03:05.017
We live in a house with wheels.

03:06.334 --> 03:07.597
I know...

03:07.632 --> 03:11.735
But that was before I died.

03:11.771 --> 03:14.514
You don't have me anymore,
Manny.

03:14.549 --> 03:18.808
You need people.

03:18.843 --> 03:20.317
It's a lot more
than I signed up for.

03:20.341 --> 03:23.420
It'll be worth it.
Midnighters protect each other.

03:23.454 --> 03:25.559
Sure, great, kumbaya.

03:25.594 --> 03:28.545
You saw it with your own eyes.

03:30.137 --> 03:32.116
I don't know if I can handle
going back in there.

03:32.151 --> 03:33.838
It's Midnight.

03:33.874 --> 03:35.382
You don't need to pretend
you're normal.

03:35.406 --> 03:38.175
Let your freak flag fly.

03:38.210 --> 03:40.148
Tell 'em what's up.

03:43.645 --> 03:45.865
This is bad.

03:45.900 --> 03:47.291
The police came into our town
and took one of us.

03:47.315 --> 03:49.311
I should've let you crush them.

03:49.346 --> 03:52.215
Stop. I made it worse for Bobo.

03:52.250 --> 03:53.692
You didn't show them anything
they didn't already suspect.

03:53.715 --> 03:54.471
Bobo is going to have to face

03:54.506 --> 03:58.049
the consequences
of our actions tonight.

03:58.084 --> 04:00.779
We scared the police,
and that never goes over well.

04:00.814 --> 04:03.201
No, we need to get back
off their radar...

04:03.236 --> 04:04.258
where we belong.

04:04.292 --> 04:05.798
And bring Bobo home.

04:05.833 --> 04:06.796
That shouldn't be too difficult,

04:06.831 --> 04:08.361
since they didn't kill Aubrey.

04:08.395 --> 04:10.125
I need help.

04:10.160 --> 04:12.921
That's an understatement.

04:12.957 --> 04:14.794
Here's the thing.
My place is overrun

04:14.830 --> 04:16.312
with ghosts and all sorts
of evil crap.

04:16.336 --> 04:18.788
Crap?

04:18.825 --> 04:20.366
Can you be more specific?
Poltergeist.

04:20.389 --> 04:22.091
Demonic entity, maybe.

04:22.128 --> 04:23.957
Well, that should be
taken care of.

04:23.991 --> 04:25.208
What makes you think
it's demonic?

04:25.231 --> 04:27.627
The growling, for one.
It's evil as...

04:27.662 --> 04:30.474
Sure you're not trying to
weasel out of keeping your word?

04:30.509 --> 04:32.880
No, I want to
get answers from Aubrey.

04:32.914 --> 04:34.763
I'm just saying, the chaos back
at my place will make it hard.

04:34.787 --> 04:36.633
I need backup.

04:36.668 --> 04:38.537
The sun will be up shortly.
I'm out.

04:38.573 --> 04:40.293
Whatever you need.

04:40.328 --> 04:42.699
I know my way around haunts.

04:42.735 --> 04:45.146
I'll go. I'm curious.

04:45.181 --> 04:49.282
You know CPR?

04:49.317 --> 04:51.271
Just in case it doesn't go well.

04:51.307 --> 04:53.892
You got the wrong man.

04:53.928 --> 04:57.006
Well, the gun that shot her
was registered to you.

04:57.041 --> 04:59.148
Well, that might be true,
but it doesn't change the fact

04:59.172 --> 05:00.435
that I didn't kill her.

05:00.470 --> 05:02.082
She was married to a skinhead.

05:02.117 --> 05:04.945
I didn't know until you told me.

05:04.979 --> 05:06.995
Okay, well, let's... let's say
that you didn't kill her.

05:07.019 --> 05:08.215
Who did?

05:08.250 --> 05:10.554
Isn't that your job?

05:10.590 --> 05:12.811
It seems to me
that your neighbors

05:12.845 --> 05:15.439
didn't seem to be
too fond of Aubrey.

05:15.475 --> 05:17.336
What with the crime scene
being what it was,

05:17.414 --> 05:19.309
dead animals, occult look...

05:19.344 --> 05:21.590
With all the rumors and stories,

05:21.625 --> 05:24.503
it's easy to assume
the worst about Midnight.

05:24.538 --> 05:26.508
Folks tend to let
their imagination run wild.

05:26.545 --> 05:28.872
Did I imagine your little friend

05:28.907 --> 05:31.061
stopping and crushing my car
with her mind?

05:31.096 --> 05:32.716
Did I imagine that?

05:32.751 --> 05:35.246
I got no idea
what you're talking about.

05:35.282 --> 05:38.876
Well...

05:38.911 --> 05:41.006
I got an idea.

05:41.041 --> 05:42.654
Just let me handle it.

05:49.489 --> 05:52.882
Sure you have nothing
you want to say?

05:52.918 --> 05:54.339
Nope.

06:00.207 --> 06:03.193
Bobo Winthrop.

06:03.195 --> 06:05.676
Peter Lowry, Aubrey's husband,
wants us to give you a message.

06:28.561 --> 06:31.897
I didn't kill her.

06:31.932 --> 06:36.339
So tell Lowry to stop
coming after me.

06:36.373 --> 06:38.804
It's barely morning.

06:38.839 --> 06:40.946
The moon won't be up
for a long time.

06:40.981 --> 06:42.705
Too many variables.
Too many strangers.

06:42.740 --> 06:44.573
I'd rather be safe than not.

06:44.608 --> 06:45.852
There's no need to worry.

06:45.929 --> 06:48.078
It's taken me a lifetime

06:48.113 --> 06:49.765
to find a home where
I'm accepted, so I worry.

06:49.789 --> 06:51.605
If anything happens,
don't hesitate.

06:51.641 --> 06:53.158
Make sure no one's hurt.

06:53.193 --> 06:54.503
I feel dread.

06:54.538 --> 06:55.665
Something is different.

06:55.700 --> 06:58.430
We do this every month.

06:58.507 --> 07:05.303
I'll see you tomorrow morning.

07:19.236 --> 07:21.003
You were right.

07:21.038 --> 07:24.049
Some seriously bad mojo.

07:24.084 --> 07:25.919
Do you see any ghosts now?

07:25.955 --> 07:27.181
Yeah.

07:30.204 --> 07:31.323
My Goddess.

07:32.346 --> 07:34.295
Whoa.

07:34.330 --> 07:36.968
You saw that too?

07:37.003 --> 07:39.293
That definitely feels like
some sort of demonic spirit.

07:40.965 --> 07:43.278
What is it?

07:43.313 --> 07:45.270
Aubrey's here.

07:51.466 --> 07:54.311
Are you gonna talk to her?

07:54.346 --> 07:56.752
Yeah, something like that.

07:56.787 --> 07:59.924
Just, stay back.

08:03.561 --> 08:06.075
Aubrey?

08:06.111 --> 08:08.019
We need your help.

08:13.532 --> 08:15.216
Bobo's in jail.

08:15.251 --> 08:18.170
So if he didn't do it,

08:18.248 --> 08:20.322
I need you to show me who did.

08:21.171 --> 08:23.875
You can...

08:23.910 --> 08:25.967
borrow my body.

08:26.001 --> 08:28.026
Show me what happened.

08:56.513 --> 09:00.205
Manfred!

09:00.241 --> 09:00.852
We need to get him out of here.

09:00.888 --> 09:02.480
Come on.

09:20.239 --> 09:21.874
Drink that.

09:21.909 --> 09:24.854
You'll feel better.

09:28.384 --> 09:32.352
I haven't slept that deep
in a long time.

09:32.387 --> 09:34.028
Your place is quiet.

09:34.062 --> 09:36.119
It's more than quiet.

09:36.155 --> 09:37.589
Inhospitable to the dead.

09:37.624 --> 09:41.998
I gave it a deep cleanse
before I moved in.

09:42.034 --> 09:45.028
Mediums don't usually
stay long in Midnight.

09:45.063 --> 09:47.294
I imagine it's got
to be hard on you.

09:47.330 --> 09:49.668
Pawn shop's not
my favorite place.

09:49.704 --> 09:51.760
Yeah.

09:51.796 --> 09:54.343
I saw the murder.

09:54.378 --> 09:57.198
A biker killed Aubrey.

09:57.235 --> 09:59.698
Sons of Lucifer?

09:59.733 --> 10:02.844
- You know them?
- I see 'em around.

10:02.880 --> 10:04.223
White power jerks.

10:04.257 --> 10:07.161
Aubrey was married to one.

10:07.197 --> 10:08.373
I'm sorry, what?

10:08.409 --> 10:11.338
Confused? Join the club.

10:11.372 --> 10:12.193
Poor Bobo looked like
he got punched in the gut

10:12.228 --> 10:14.733
when Livingston told him.

10:14.768 --> 10:17.730
You need to tell the police
what you saw.

10:17.765 --> 10:18.669
- I didn't see who killed her.
- You know enough

10:18.703 --> 10:20.462
to point them away from Bobo.

10:20.496 --> 10:22.014
You really think
he'll believe me?

10:22.049 --> 10:23.642
He might.

10:23.678 --> 10:25.775
You led him to the gun.

10:25.810 --> 10:29.278
It's a long shot, yeah,
but we're neighbors now.

10:29.313 --> 10:32.167
It's what Midnighters do.

10:32.202 --> 10:35.662
Plus, you promised.

10:35.698 --> 10:37.264
Sure.

10:37.300 --> 10:40.653
Sure, I'll be neighborly. Great.

10:40.687 --> 10:43.375
While you're doing that, I'll
get to working on your house.

10:43.410 --> 10:46.422
- With whatever that is?
- It's a devil's net.

10:46.457 --> 10:48.348
Captures evil.

10:48.383 --> 10:50.391
Lets me measure
malevolent energies.

10:50.427 --> 10:52.291
We have got to take care
of your house ASAP.

10:52.326 --> 10:53.885
That thing under the floor?

10:53.921 --> 10:55.197
It's worrisome.

10:55.233 --> 10:58.708
You think by conjuring
Aubrey, I...

10:58.743 --> 10:59.382
invited it in?

10:59.416 --> 11:01.390
You know, like I said before,

11:01.426 --> 11:02.781
Midnight's on a veil
between worlds.

11:02.804 --> 11:04.895
Maybe you did.

11:04.930 --> 11:07.509
Regardless, we got to get it
back on its side of the veil.

11:07.544 --> 11:08.829
How?

11:08.865 --> 11:11.195
An exorcism.

11:11.231 --> 11:12.740
Great.

11:12.775 --> 11:14.641
But I will need to prepare.

11:14.676 --> 11:18.758
So while that's happening,
you talk to Livingston.

11:20.737 --> 11:23.615
I got to give Manfred
a ride to the police station.

11:26.988 --> 11:29.261
Before you go...

11:31.323 --> 11:33.479
I found this...

11:33.481 --> 11:36.035
while I was doing laundry.

11:36.071 --> 11:39.264
Tell me you did not go flying.

11:39.299 --> 11:41.017
I went flying.

11:41.052 --> 11:41.955
Someone could have seen you.

11:41.990 --> 11:43.881
I know,
but with Aubrey's murder,

11:43.916 --> 11:46.853
Manfred's arrival,
I was worried.

11:46.888 --> 11:49.128
Worried about what?

11:49.163 --> 11:51.609
About the end of everything
we know and love.

11:51.645 --> 11:54.409
I gotta go.

11:54.444 --> 11:56.293
We're finishing
this conversation.

11:56.329 --> 11:57.985
I know. I love you.

12:11.309 --> 12:14.920
Hey.

12:14.956 --> 12:17.218
What are you and Joe doing?

12:17.252 --> 12:20.194
Um, I saw something.
I think it can help Bobo.

12:20.229 --> 12:23.213
Well, good luck.

12:23.248 --> 12:25.369
You help him, everybody's
gonna be really grateful.

12:25.404 --> 12:27.267
Yeah, I'm just trying
to do the right thing.

12:27.303 --> 12:29.423
Well, now you're
just trying to impress me.

12:29.458 --> 12:31.413
Is it working?

12:31.448 --> 12:33.751
I don't know.

12:33.786 --> 12:37.110
I'm working tonight,
but maybe later

12:37.145 --> 12:40.360
this week we can...
See you, Joe.

12:40.396 --> 12:43.212
Have a nice day.

12:43.247 --> 12:44.472
Hey, Joe.

12:48.089 --> 12:50.194
Let's go to Davy.

12:56.853 --> 13:00.334
Had the Sons of Lucifer patch
on the back of his jacket.

13:00.370 --> 13:03.684
And this face mask,
like a skeleton.

13:03.719 --> 13:05.598
- But you didn't see his face?
- No.

13:05.676 --> 13:09.454
She didn't get a good look.

13:09.456 --> 13:11.071
I was right about the gun.

13:11.106 --> 13:14.446
- That was very specific.
- Okay, fine.

13:14.481 --> 13:17.182
Specific.

13:17.217 --> 13:19.901
The night Aubrey died,

13:19.937 --> 13:21.528
she was taking a walk,
clearing her head.

13:21.595 --> 13:24.038
She didn't know what to do.

13:24.074 --> 13:27.164
She wanted to tell Bobo
she'd lied, but she was scared.

13:27.199 --> 13:27.935
She didn't want to lose him.

13:27.971 --> 13:30.715
- And she said all this?
- In a way.

13:30.749 --> 13:34.122
She... her spirit showed me
what happened.

13:34.157 --> 13:36.170
What she remembered.

13:39.447 --> 13:42.040
A truck shows up.

13:42.075 --> 13:43.798
Right away she knows
something's not right.

13:43.834 --> 13:45.415
She goes for the pistol
in her bag,

13:45.450 --> 13:47.537
but it didn't help her.

13:48.566 --> 13:50.579
The guy jumped her from behind,

13:50.615 --> 13:51.661
took the gun,
and shot her with it.

13:51.685 --> 13:56.940
After that, she was in and out
of consciousness for a while.

13:56.975 --> 14:00.330
She remembers being
in the back of the truck.

14:00.365 --> 14:02.660
She saw him toss the gun.

14:02.695 --> 14:06.424
And then she was dragged
to the river's edge.

14:06.459 --> 14:08.895
Other things had died there.

14:08.931 --> 14:13.762
Aubrey realized she was
being left there to die.

14:13.798 --> 14:14.974
It took a while.

14:16.377 --> 14:19.078
Three days, to be specific.

14:19.113 --> 14:20.986
Okay.

14:21.020 --> 14:24.734
It could be that her ghost

14:24.768 --> 14:26.225
told you all of this.

14:26.260 --> 14:28.655
There could be a simpler reason.

14:29.967 --> 14:32.593
I killed her?

14:32.628 --> 14:34.393
He wouldn't have come
if he were involved.

14:34.427 --> 14:35.826
The gun was dumped in the river.

14:35.861 --> 14:38.944
Guessing that's not
the only evidence he got rid of.

14:38.980 --> 14:41.963
You really want to find
the killer, you keep looking.

14:52.834 --> 14:55.677
That was pretty badass.

14:55.713 --> 14:59.416
I hope it helps.

14:59.451 --> 15:05.734
I got faith.

15:05.769 --> 15:07.318
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

15:07.354 --> 15:12.997
Resume the search
further downstream.

15:13.033 --> 15:17.441
Humor me.
In case we missed something.

15:17.477 --> 15:20.519
Thanks.

15:20.554 --> 15:21.554
Back from the hospital?

15:21.589 --> 15:22.856
One's still in surgery.

15:22.891 --> 15:24.473
Knee's being rebuilt.

15:24.508 --> 15:27.117
The others are stable.

15:27.152 --> 15:28.892
Good thing they're Nazis,
or I'd feel bad.

15:28.927 --> 15:30.807
Think this is funny?

15:30.843 --> 15:33.834
It's not.

15:33.870 --> 15:37.731
You're suspended.

15:37.767 --> 15:41.952
- What?
- Till further notice.

15:41.987 --> 15:43.410
Okay, so I pushed a little hard.

15:43.445 --> 15:45.260
Effective immediately.

15:49.475 --> 15:51.047
Since I was a kid,

15:51.083 --> 15:54.421
I've known Midnight's
all sorts of bad.

15:54.457 --> 15:56.055
Now we've seen it.

15:56.089 --> 15:58.577
Those Midnighters are dangerous,

15:58.611 --> 16:00.442
and you know it.

16:06.878 --> 16:11.519
"But now ask the beasts,

16:11.555 --> 16:15.814
"and let them teach you.

16:15.849 --> 16:19.056
And the birds of the heavens,
let them tell you."

16:28.427 --> 16:32.537
Or speak to the earth

16:32.573 --> 16:34.395
and let it teach you.

16:43.145 --> 16:45.729
You sure about this?

16:45.764 --> 16:47.164
Mirrors in séances
can get messy.

16:47.200 --> 16:49.600
You don't need 'em

16:49.635 --> 16:50.596
'cause you can see the dead.

16:50.632 --> 16:53.358
I can't.

16:53.393 --> 16:55.895
The mirrors help me
see the spirit realm.

16:55.931 --> 16:58.266
You know, glimpse
other dimensions.

16:58.302 --> 17:01.666
Ooh.

17:01.701 --> 17:04.243
- Belonged to my grandma.
- Feels powerful.

17:04.279 --> 17:07.188
Yeah, supposedly my ancestors
fought demons

17:07.223 --> 17:10.074
and demonic possessions
back in Europe.

17:10.108 --> 17:14.036
Grandma, packrat that she was,
she kept a ton of stuff.

17:14.071 --> 17:15.231
Probably illegal.

17:15.266 --> 17:16.507
I'm intrigued.

17:16.540 --> 17:18.191
But that's for another time.

17:18.227 --> 17:20.661
Now we have an exorcism
to perform.

17:20.695 --> 17:22.468
You ready?

17:22.546 --> 17:27.710
As ready as I'll ever be.

17:33.383 --> 17:35.504
- Whoa.
- Bad as before?

17:39.054 --> 17:42.592
Worse.

17:42.628 --> 17:44.338
Well, there's some
evil present, for sure.

17:52.196 --> 17:56.861
Spirits who once called this
place home, we need to talk.

17:58.464 --> 17:59.964
They listening?

17:59.999 --> 18:04.831
Not so much.
More like circling me.

18:04.865 --> 18:08.040
You're their ride
back to the living.

18:08.074 --> 18:11.563
I can't compete.
I need to be alone.

18:11.598 --> 18:13.653
They need to have
no other options for leaving.

18:13.689 --> 18:15.958
You can be hijacked. I can't.

18:15.993 --> 18:17.941
Right, I'll just be
on the porch if you need me.

18:20.743 --> 18:22.823
As I was saying.

18:22.858 --> 18:24.837
Spirits, we need to talk.

18:46.233 --> 18:47.813
God, I hate cats.

19:46.818 --> 19:47.812
My God.

20:30.895 --> 20:32.758
All right, ladies, Sam,
you have 15 minutes

20:32.793 --> 20:35.096
to finish up,
or y'all can take it to go.

20:38.075 --> 20:40.428
We're closed.

20:40.463 --> 20:42.609
- You can't let anyone leave.
- I can't?

20:42.645 --> 20:43.405
Something's out there.

20:43.440 --> 20:46.671
Something strong enough
to kill a person

20:46.707 --> 20:48.130
and hoist 'em up a tree.

20:48.165 --> 20:50.494
It's a full moon.

20:50.529 --> 20:51.067
You know what?
Just scratch that.

20:51.101 --> 20:54.042
You can stay as long
as you need.

20:54.077 --> 20:56.025
Where's Creek?

20:56.060 --> 20:58.728
She said she was working.
She is, just not here.

21:28.015 --> 21:31.503
Creek!

21:31.539 --> 21:31.794
Creek!

21:31.829 --> 21:33.818
Creek!

21:42.044 --> 21:44.421
Come here!

21:44.457 --> 21:46.113
- What was that?
- It's a tiger.

21:46.148 --> 21:48.103
What? Come with me!

21:52.616 --> 21:54.115
This way. Here.

21:58.387 --> 22:00.933
Not this way.

22:10.036 --> 22:12.838
Why the hell is there a tiger?

22:12.873 --> 22:14.301
I think it's the Rev.

22:14.336 --> 22:15.245
What? Is he okay?

22:15.280 --> 22:17.552
He'll be fine. Let's move, now!

22:45.500 --> 22:47.499
You're late.

22:47.535 --> 22:51.552
Moving slowly tonight.

22:51.588 --> 22:54.529
I haven't had breakfast.

22:54.564 --> 22:57.028
No. I covered the shop all day.

22:57.063 --> 22:59.823
No leeching tonight.

22:59.857 --> 23:03.867
I'm wiped.

23:03.902 --> 23:07.795
I smell blood.

23:07.830 --> 23:09.284
A lot of it.

23:31.831 --> 23:34.136
You let him out, didn't you?

23:34.171 --> 23:36.949
No, she did.

23:39.854 --> 23:41.556
So, if it bites you, do you...

23:41.591 --> 23:45.434
You're born a were, dimwit.

23:45.469 --> 23:48.048
Not exactly common knowledge.
Weretigers are rare nowadays.

23:48.082 --> 23:51.554
- So the Rev did that?
- Such a waste.

23:55.625 --> 23:58.014
You're bleeding, aren't you?

23:58.048 --> 24:01.081
- A little.
- More than a little.

24:01.117 --> 24:02.825
Smells fresh.
I got it, Uncle Lem.

24:02.861 --> 24:05.316
Here, have Madonna
take a look at it for you.

24:09.297 --> 24:10.576
I need ammo.

24:19.982 --> 24:24.339
We have to stop it
before it hurts anyone else.

24:24.372 --> 24:27.183
Silver makes me sick,

24:27.218 --> 24:31.666
but if one of those so much
as grazes the Rev, he's dead.

24:31.701 --> 24:35.090
Well, it's not the Rev
we're dealing with anymore.

24:45.612 --> 24:48.587
It's the last one.

24:54.387 --> 24:55.520
How do you know how to do this?

24:55.544 --> 24:57.146
Well, to live in Midnight,

24:57.183 --> 25:00.505
you need to know
how to protect yourself,

25:00.582 --> 25:04.598
and the people that you love.

25:04.634 --> 25:06.269
And that girl over there
is one of 'em.

25:09.223 --> 25:11.340
She's sweet on you.

25:11.374 --> 25:14.540
But so far, the only thing
you've brought here is trouble.

25:17.949 --> 25:20.164
So don't make me regret
sewing you up.

25:22.638 --> 25:25.673
I won't.

25:30.273 --> 25:32.032
Thanks.

25:36.111 --> 25:37.291
I don't see him.

25:37.326 --> 25:38.508
You all right?

25:38.542 --> 25:40.609
Yeah.

25:40.644 --> 25:42.190
Yeah, better than some ERs
I've been to.

25:46.018 --> 25:48.647
So thanks for saving my life
back there.

25:48.682 --> 25:50.516
Ditto.

25:59.989 --> 26:01.806
If you'll excuse me.

26:11.386 --> 26:12.771
- Fiji!
- Shh!

26:33.732 --> 26:36.442
Exorcism complete.

26:36.478 --> 26:37.611
Your home is now
inhospitable to the dead.

26:37.635 --> 26:39.131
Thank you very much.

26:41.928 --> 26:44.274
Whoo.

26:44.309 --> 26:47.013
Um, Fiji?

26:47.047 --> 26:48.204
What's that?

26:51.885 --> 26:54.744
Something real evil
is still in here.

26:54.780 --> 26:56.432
You see anything?

26:56.466 --> 26:57.944
No.

26:58.022 --> 27:00.237
No, the spirits are all gone.

27:02.876 --> 27:04.959
It's, it's still here.

27:07.681 --> 27:09.630
Fiji.

27:09.666 --> 27:11.335
What do you want?

27:11.370 --> 27:13.469
- We should go.
- - Fiji.

27:13.504 --> 27:16.273
You hear that?

27:16.308 --> 27:18.515
Who are you? What do you want?

27:21.005 --> 27:23.063
I want you!

27:31.501 --> 27:32.699
No.

27:56.279 --> 27:58.502
- What's doing this?
- I don't know!

28:15.574 --> 28:16.945
What... what is it doing?

28:19.022 --> 28:20.916
What is it doing?
I can't stop it.

28:23.275 --> 28:25.769
Please help me! Please help me.

28:25.804 --> 28:27.067
I won't let it hurt you.

28:27.103 --> 28:29.623
But...

28:29.659 --> 28:30.727
I need someone a lot
more powerful than me.

28:30.750 --> 28:32.667
- Who?
- Long story.

28:32.703 --> 28:37.299
I'll be back in a sec.

28:37.334 --> 28:39.663
Where you going?

28:39.698 --> 28:42.724
I need some magic
from the stash.

28:42.759 --> 28:44.625
Where are you going with your

28:44.660 --> 28:47.190
greatgreatgreatgreat
grandma's skull?

28:47.225 --> 28:48.505
You said she was powerful,

28:48.540 --> 28:50.192
and I need her help.

28:53.941 --> 28:55.610
Yikes.

28:59.110 --> 29:00.994
Demon.

29:01.029 --> 29:03.343
Satanic power.

29:03.378 --> 29:05.055
Whatever the hell you are.

29:05.090 --> 29:06.732
Let her go.

29:11.308 --> 29:13.897
I call to you, my ancestors.

29:13.931 --> 29:14.922
I summon you.

29:17.686 --> 29:21.091
Help me condemn this demon

29:21.125 --> 29:23.200
back to hell!

29:46.541 --> 29:48.912
Nothing.

29:52.545 --> 29:54.637
Are you hurt?

29:54.672 --> 29:56.182
I don't... I don't think so.

29:56.218 --> 29:58.796
But...

29:58.830 --> 30:00.664
it's gone.

30:00.700 --> 30:03.493
There's no evil here.

30:03.569 --> 30:06.486
Your home is cleansed now.

30:06.521 --> 30:10.110
Yeah. Yeah, the house is quiet.

30:10.145 --> 30:12.128
That was...

30:12.162 --> 30:15.147
That was not good.

30:15.181 --> 30:17.594
I need to go home
and take a bath.

30:17.629 --> 30:20.876
I wouldn't leave.

30:20.911 --> 30:24.377
The Rev escaped.

30:24.412 --> 30:25.468
What?

30:29.505 --> 30:31.357
- Yeah.
- Did you find him?

30:31.391 --> 30:33.762
No sign. I'm outside of Davy.

30:33.798 --> 30:34.086
Lem's searching the river.

30:34.121 --> 30:35.715
We'll take the ranches.

30:35.751 --> 30:36.840
We?

30:41.283 --> 30:43.803
What do we do if we see him?

30:43.837 --> 30:46.218
We get him home.

30:46.254 --> 30:48.849
Okay.

30:48.885 --> 30:51.438
Wait, stop.

30:51.473 --> 30:53.786
- You see him?
- No.

30:53.820 --> 30:56.689
But I think he's been here.

31:03.506 --> 31:05.787
Olivia, I think we got him.

31:17.228 --> 31:20.881
Shouldn't we wait
till Olivia and Lem get here?

31:20.915 --> 31:22.906
They'll be here any second.

31:57.180 --> 31:58.702
You two okay?

31:58.736 --> 31:59.768
We're good.

31:59.802 --> 32:02.067
Great, never been better.

32:06.732 --> 32:09.329
Emilio.

32:09.364 --> 32:13.274
We've been friends
for a long time.

32:17.054 --> 32:19.344
It's not the Rev.

32:19.378 --> 32:20.902
- Why isn't she shooting him?
- No, he's a friend.

32:20.926 --> 32:23.570
Most days.

32:35.308 --> 32:38.731
No, no, no, I'm okay.

32:38.765 --> 32:40.739
This needs to end.

32:40.775 --> 32:41.509
Olivia, no! You can't.

32:41.544 --> 32:43.626
Don't!

32:43.661 --> 32:45.065
He'd want this.

32:45.101 --> 32:47.289
Stop. No.

32:47.325 --> 32:48.935
The Rev didn't want
to hurt anyone.

32:48.970 --> 32:52.359
Like you said...

32:52.395 --> 32:53.691
he's not the Rev.

34:16.206 --> 34:18.529
You're back.

34:19.523 --> 34:22.498
It's okay now.

34:22.533 --> 34:26.063
No, it's not.

34:26.099 --> 34:27.917
I know what I did.

34:52.664 --> 34:57.772
Bobo.

34:57.807 --> 35:00.642
One of your neighbors came
forward with some information.

35:00.677 --> 35:03.355
We followed it up.

35:03.390 --> 35:05.101
We found a Sons of Lucifer
jacket downstream

35:05.137 --> 35:06.961
from where we found the pistol.

35:06.997 --> 35:09.947
There was a hair in the zipper.

35:09.981 --> 35:12.204
It matched Aubrey.

35:12.240 --> 35:15.579
You think her husband did this?

35:15.613 --> 35:20.236
Well, let's just say that he
is a person of interest.

35:20.271 --> 35:22.378
Now, we're looking for Lowry.
If you see him first...

35:22.413 --> 35:23.660
I'll call you.

35:26.737 --> 35:28.928
Thank you, Sheriff.

35:28.963 --> 35:30.316
- Hey, good luck.
- Thank you.

35:38.425 --> 35:40.820
Deliver her from evil.

35:40.855 --> 35:42.309
Bid her soul eternal rest.

35:42.344 --> 35:49.546
Amen.

35:49.581 --> 35:53.151
Been a long time
since I've killed.

35:53.187 --> 35:55.319
It's not your fault.

35:55.353 --> 35:57.179
Well...

35:57.214 --> 36:01.041
the weretiger is me.

36:01.077 --> 36:03.531
Before coming to Midnight,
I spent a lot of time alone.

36:03.567 --> 36:05.177
Tigers are solitary,
but humans...

36:05.211 --> 36:07.095
Not so much.

36:07.131 --> 36:08.410
It's hard,

36:08.446 --> 36:11.586
reconciling both sides.

36:11.621 --> 36:14.076
That's why I'm a reverend.

36:14.111 --> 36:20.064
I suppose I'm trying to find
meaning in this duality.

36:20.098 --> 36:23.975
- Any luck?
- Yes.

36:24.052 --> 36:26.299
Being a reverend led me here.

36:26.334 --> 36:28.326
This is my home, my purpose.

36:28.361 --> 36:30.526
And I don't want to lose it.

36:30.562 --> 36:34.123
You won't.
We won't let that happen.

36:40.146 --> 36:43.452
Last night was different.

36:43.488 --> 36:46.885
Usually, a bull
is enough to sate me.

36:46.920 --> 36:48.853
This time it wasn't.

36:48.888 --> 36:51.764
Something is different.

36:51.799 --> 36:54.625
And that scares me.

36:54.661 --> 36:56.641
Yeah.

37:18.502 --> 37:20.253
Fiji.

37:26.247 --> 37:28.640
Fiji.

37:35.435 --> 37:38.103
Fiji!

37:38.139 --> 37:41.534
Fiji?

37:41.569 --> 37:43.245
You're out.

37:46.628 --> 37:51.031
- Charges dropped.
- Yes.

37:51.067 --> 37:53.418
I owe you.

37:53.454 --> 37:57.557
Not too often friends
take on the cops for me.

37:57.593 --> 38:00.237
Well...

38:00.273 --> 38:02.340
now it's time to move past
all this ugliness.

38:02.375 --> 38:04.436
I can't.

38:04.471 --> 38:06.671
Aubrey's husband
is still out there,

38:06.706 --> 38:09.660
and as long as he is,

38:09.695 --> 38:12.054
this isn't over.

38:48.987 --> 38:50.636
Shouldn't have let
Bobo Winthrop out.

38:50.671 --> 38:52.823
We're done here.

38:58.142 --> 38:59.901
Evil is being drawn here.

38:59.936 --> 39:03.706
Human evil, supernatural evil.

39:03.741 --> 39:06.485
And it's just beginning.

39:06.520 --> 39:11.701
The more that evil takes hold,
the more the veil frays...

39:11.736 --> 39:13.755
Until it breaks altogether.

39:16.868 --> 39:19.712
How do you know all this?

39:19.748 --> 39:21.934
A millennia ago,

39:21.969 --> 39:25.430
the last time it tore,
I was here.

39:25.465 --> 39:27.758
So that's it?

39:27.835 --> 39:29.460
We wait for this to happen?

39:29.496 --> 39:30.887
Maybe not.

39:30.923 --> 39:33.817
There's a prophecy.

39:33.852 --> 39:35.005
An army will rise
to battle the evil

39:35.029 --> 39:37.706
and seal the veil forever.

39:37.741 --> 39:41.613
That army will be led by a man
with the gift of vision,

39:41.647 --> 39:44.707
who can bridge
the living and the dead.

39:44.743 --> 39:47.321
The new guy?

39:47.356 --> 39:50.950
My combo housewarming and...

39:50.986 --> 39:53.880
"thanks for saving my ass" gift.

39:53.916 --> 39:58.921
- That's awesome, thanks.
- Yeah.

39:58.956 --> 40:04.445
Fiji told me what you did.

40:04.481 --> 40:07.409
Um...

40:07.444 --> 40:11.097
Aubrey, she... she wanted
to tell you the truth.

40:11.132 --> 40:12.750
Her husband asked her
to get to know you,

40:12.785 --> 40:15.729
but what she felt for you,
that was...

40:15.765 --> 40:18.825
That was real.

40:18.860 --> 40:22.114
Thanks for that.

40:22.149 --> 40:26.578
But the woman I love,
she didn't exist.

40:27.515 --> 40:29.000
Bobo.

40:29.035 --> 40:30.593
Glad to have you back.

40:30.628 --> 40:38.631
Nice to be back.

40:41.186 --> 40:42.740
I'm just checking.
How's the stitches?

40:42.764 --> 40:44.731
Painful.

40:44.767 --> 40:47.101
But um...

40:47.137 --> 40:49.563
At least there's a good story
with the scar.

40:50.607 --> 40:53.134
Ooh.

40:53.170 --> 40:54.820
Looks like you're
making yourself at home.

40:54.855 --> 40:56.382
Wow.

40:56.417 --> 40:58.876
I thought for sure
after the tiger

40:58.913 --> 41:01.139
and the ghosts, you'd be gone.

41:01.173 --> 41:02.734
Well, I can't leave now.
I got a sign.

41:05.638 --> 41:07.765
Well?

41:07.799 --> 41:12.388
Well, what?

41:12.423 --> 41:15.518
Well, I think you said that
once you weren't bleeding...

41:23.790 --> 41:26.108
Just... just curious.

41:26.143 --> 41:28.629
Is this about
pissing off your dad?

41:29.540 --> 41:32.776
I'd say maybe 2%
is me rebelling,

41:32.811 --> 41:37.650
and the rest is me
kind of being into you.

41:37.686 --> 41:41.948
Well, 98%.

41:41.983 --> 41:43.810
I can live with that.

41:47.174 --> 41:51.412
Manfred stands
between us and that?

41:51.448 --> 41:56.312
I think so.

41:56.347 --> 41:58.582
Damn.
