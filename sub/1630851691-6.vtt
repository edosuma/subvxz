02:05.292 --> 02:07.058
We don't feel that's

02:09.630 --> 02:11.229
Not saying that.

02:28.015 --> 02:29.647
Raesha, frankie,

02:29.683 --> 02:30.582
What are you doing miles?!

02:30.717 --> 02:31.649
Belle, why would you
bring my kids here

02:31.685 --> 02:32.584
Without my permission?

02:32.719 --> 02:34.118
Belinda:
<i> She's just trying to help.</i>

Miles:
<i> You think that's</i>

02:35.755 --> 02:37.322
All she's here to do

02:50.938 --> 02:53.538
What, you gonna tell
me you're not here
riling people up?

02:53.541 --> 02:55.406
Just so you can
exploit their pain
for a pay cheque!

02:55.442 --> 02:56.575
You're right, miles.

02:56.644 --> 02:59.011
This-this is
about money.

02:59.146 --> 03:02.648
<i> But it's also about sending a</i>

03:02.650 --> 03:04.917
<i> They can't provide</i>
<i> a platform for hate</i>

03:05.052 --> 03:07.219
And get away with
it scot-free.

03:07.354 --> 03:09.688
Money ain't nothing
to these people.

03:09.690 --> 03:11.690
You wanna fight
for something?

03:11.692 --> 03:12.958
Fight to stop them
from creating
another killer

03:13.027 --> 03:14.426
Like that boy.

03:15.028 --> 03:16.395
Can you do that?

03:16.530 --> 03:17.796
I-I...

03:18.499 --> 03:19.431
Can you?

03:19.566 --> 03:22.867
(tense music)

03:22.903 --> 03:24.202
Like I said,

03:24.238 --> 03:26.238
You ain't selling

03:26.373 --> 03:27.639

03:29.343 --> 03:30.575
Bye.

03:30.578 --> 03:31.976
Miles:
<i> Come on.</i>

03:32.546 --> 03:34.479
(crowd murmuring)

03:37.451 --> 03:40.852
You're saying you're opposed
to a redefinition of the terms

03:40.888 --> 03:42.020
"work" and "home"?

03:42.155 --> 03:43.188
Not at all, reggie.

03:43.323 --> 03:44.322
What I believe is when-

03:44.391 --> 03:45.356
Oink.

03:45.392 --> 03:46.391
Student:
<i> Oink.</i>

03:46.393 --> 03:47.725
Oink.
-Oink.

03:50.764 --> 03:53.465
When definitions change
freely within society,

03:53.467 --> 03:56.668
<i> There is less of a</i>
<i> need to change</i>
<i> definitions legally.</i>

03:56.704 --> 03:58.469
As our understanding
of "women",

03:58.505 --> 03:59.404
"equality", "work"-

03:59.539 --> 04:00.405
Misogynist!

04:00.540 --> 04:01.406
Woman:
<i> This is ridiculous.</i>

04:01.541 --> 04:02.440
Woman 2:
<i> This is ridiculous.</i>

04:02.509 --> 04:03.809
I can't even
listen to this.

04:12.953 --> 04:14.486
Elina?

04:14.555 --> 04:15.487
What the hell was
that all about?

04:15.556 --> 04:16.521
We weren't going
to sit there

04:16.590 --> 04:18.390
And listen even one
more second of his bs.

04:18.392 --> 04:20.125
Professor raines?

04:20.127 --> 04:22.294
He set up a private webpage
where the male law students

04:22.296 --> 04:24.529
Make these messed up comments
about the female students.

04:24.565 --> 04:25.930
<i> It's gross.</i>

04:26.900 --> 04:28.200
One of my guy friends
sent this to me.

04:28.335 --> 04:29.400
<i> "why should we</i>
<i> respect them</i>

04:29.436 --> 04:30.769
"when they don't

04:30.771 --> 04:31.903
And check the comments,

04:31.939 --> 04:33.538
<i> "wanna win cases?</i>
<i> Wear a bikini."</i>

04:33.574 --> 04:34.773
And this one,

04:34.908 --> 04:36.975
"guess who probably
screwed her way
into law school?"

04:37.110 --> 04:39.077

05:09.276 --> 05:10.208
Doug:
<i> Sorry about what?</i>

05:10.277 --> 05:11.743
We were just
making some
dinner.

05:11.779 --> 05:12.744
Did you want
to stay? We've
made plenty.

05:12.780 --> 05:14.012
Iris:
<i> Oh no, no, no.</i>

05:14.081 --> 05:15.213
<i> That's so cool of you.</i>
<i> Thank you.</i>

05:15.282 --> 05:16.915
<i> But I have a lot</i>
<i> of work to do.</i>

05:17.050 --> 05:18.316
I was just going
to grab a sandwich

05:18.319 --> 05:20.018
And just get to
those statements.

05:20.020 --> 05:22.020
Doug:
<i> Right. I was drafting</i>
<i> some affidavits then I um-</i>

05:22.155 --> 05:23.321

<i> in the shower,</i>

05:28.796 --> 05:30.228
So why don't you
grab the spare key.

05:30.297 --> 05:31.630

Uh, no, not at all.

05:39.807 --> 05:40.706

05:40.841 --> 05:41.807

<i> These are just breadcrumbs.</i>

06:02.662 --> 06:04.129
What'd you say?

06:04.264 --> 06:05.496
These searches they're...

06:06.800 --> 06:10.402
They lead people to these spots
where their hate thrives,

06:10.471 --> 06:11.536
Unchecked.

06:11.538 --> 06:14.773
Like three clicks and
I'm in a heap of misery.

06:14.842 --> 06:17.609
Yeah well, that's why I
don't mess with social media.

06:18.879 --> 06:21.413
What's scary is how
insidious this is.

06:23.917 --> 06:27.485
<i> You could be a libertarian</i>
<i> or a "vanilla" conservative</i>

06:27.621 --> 06:29.521
<i> And the algorithm</i>
<i> leads you straight to</i>

06:29.656 --> 06:31.757
A trench of
hard-r rhetoric.

06:31.892 --> 06:32.858
Avery:
<i> Yeah, but all these people</i>

06:32.860 --> 06:35.026
Aren't shooting up a
church on a Sunday.

06:35.028 --> 06:36.761
By that logic the ford
company was right

06:36.764 --> 06:38.830
Not to fix the brake
light on the pinto.

06:38.965 --> 06:42.834
Marce, all I'm saying is that
suing a tech company in tort,

06:42.870 --> 06:45.002
I mean, it doesn't get
more uphill than that.

06:45.973 --> 06:48.006
Well you know me,
I like a challenge.

06:48.141 --> 06:49.507

<i> Well, look,</i>
<i> I'm happy to help you.</i>

you know that right?

06:52.245 --> 06:53.545
And I'm grateful.

06:55.115 --> 06:57.782
I just, I think it's
best we don't mix-

06:57.784 --> 06:58.817
Business with
pleasure.

06:58.886 --> 07:00.252
Yeah,
I get it.

07:03.423 --> 07:04.923

done about it?

07:07.127 --> 07:10.561

him to take it down, marcus.

07:13.400 --> 07:16.268
No, don't give me that

09:06.846 --> 09:09.781
Marcie:
<i> Your honour, todotube does</i>
<i> have an agent in the province,</i>

09:09.850 --> 09:12.317

registered here.

09:12.386 --> 09:13.785
Curran:
<i> Your honour, that is</i>
<i> only for tax purposes.</i>

09:13.920 --> 09:15.253
Nothing more.

09:15.255 --> 09:18.056
Perhaps, but it's enough to
spark my curiosity, mr. Bedard.

09:18.191 --> 09:19.424
<i> Ms. Diggs,</i>

09:19.493 --> 09:22.928
<i> Prove that todotube indeed has</i>
<i> a presence in nova scotia,</i>

09:23.063 --> 09:26.064
Or I'll have no choice
but to dismiss your claim.

09:26.066 --> 09:27.465
That's all.

09:29.236 --> 09:30.602
What time is it?

09:30.737 --> 09:32.003

09:58.465 --> 10:00.498

for those people.

10:00.567 --> 10:01.833
But we've lost too.

10:03.070 --> 10:05.203
Your son killed
twelve people.

10:05.338 --> 10:06.604
<i> That's fact.</i>

10:06.607 --> 10:08.339
<i> But I believe that</i>
<i> he was radicalized</i>

10:08.408 --> 10:10.775
Through todotube's platform

10:10.777 --> 10:13.778
And that's the focus
of my class action.

10:13.780 --> 10:17.615
<i> We want to force todotube</i>
<i> to change the algorithm</i>

10:17.651 --> 10:20.117
That led your son
to racist content

10:20.153 --> 10:22.687
And then incited
him to violence.

10:22.822 --> 10:24.822
<i> I think with your help</i>
<i> we could document</i>

10:24.824 --> 10:27.292

to this content.

<i> To be a safe space</i>

fire of misogyny.

<i> And I suppose you've</i>
<i> been a feminist</i>

11:33.193 --> 11:34.459

11:35.662 --> 11:37.328
<i> From my limited study</i>
<i> of ancient history,</i>

11:37.397 --> 11:41.666
It was your generation that
permitted misogyny to run wild.

11:41.735 --> 11:43.268
Like to know where all
this outrage of yours was

11:43.403 --> 11:44.436
Decades ago.

11:44.571 --> 11:46.204
What are you
talking about?

11:46.206 --> 11:48.206
We were the ones helping
to fight for equal pay

11:48.275 --> 11:49.941
And women's
reproductive rights.

11:50.076 --> 11:51.576
Yeah, and you failed

11:51.645 --> 11:53.611
On sexual harassment,
spousal assault,

11:54.214 --> 11:55.546
Abortion.

11:55.582 --> 11:56.481
Come on.

11:56.616 --> 11:58.416

those fights.

12:35.721 --> 12:37.188
Oh, it was so weird.

12:37.323 --> 12:39.890
There she was in her
underwear cooking lamb,

12:39.926 --> 12:41.693
<i> And I walk in looking</i>
<i> like a third wheel.</i>

12:41.828 --> 12:43.127
Oh boy.

12:43.130 --> 12:45.596
It was like having a
stranger in my own home.

12:45.632 --> 12:46.798
Doug's home.

12:46.800 --> 12:47.865
Whatever.

12:47.867 --> 12:48.700
Don't you just love

12:48.835 --> 12:50.935
When corporations
structure themselves

12:51.070 --> 12:54.505
Like russian nesting dolls,
subs after subs of subs.

12:54.574 --> 12:56.073
Is this always an issue?

12:56.109 --> 12:58.709
Yep. That looks good.

convince the shooter's parents

13:09.756 --> 13:11.422
Ooh, I bet that
didn't go well.

13:11.491 --> 13:13.491
Fists were exchanged.

13:13.626 --> 13:14.959
Oh, the guy's got a
right to be angry.

13:14.961 --> 13:16.961
Sure but he's
not in control.

13:16.963 --> 13:19.163

18:57.437 --> 18:59.971
She said raesha's been
missing a lot of school,

19:00.106 --> 19:01.038
<i> And now she's</i>
<i> fist fighting?</i>

19:01.174 --> 19:03.140
You're blowing this
out of proportion, belle.

19:03.209 --> 19:05.243
<i> So I let her stay</i>
<i> at home sometimes.</i>

19:05.245 --> 19:06.510
Listen, go to the truck,
it's okay.

19:06.546 --> 19:07.878
I'll be right there.

19:09.082 --> 19:10.380
Raesha and frankie

19:10.416 --> 19:12.449
<i> Need to say a proper</i>
<i> goodbye to their mother.</i>

19:12.485 --> 19:14.785
We need to say a proper goodbye
so we can start healing.

19:14.821 --> 19:16.921
Is that why you want to get my
kids involved in this lawsuit?

19:16.923 --> 19:19.723
Someone needs to be held
responsible for thea's death!

19:19.759 --> 19:21.259
Marcie's just trying
to give us that.

19:21.261 --> 19:22.994
Yeah, bet the money
don't hurt either, does it?

19:23.129 --> 19:24.362
Screw you, miles!

19:24.497 --> 19:25.529
Family, please.

19:25.598 --> 19:26.531
Would it be so bad

19:26.666 --> 19:28.866
If something good came
out of this tragedy?

19:29.001 --> 19:30.334
If the kids' school
was paid for?

19:30.469 --> 19:32.402
We lost people belle.

19:32.438 --> 19:33.337
<i> This lawsuit-</i>

19:33.472 --> 19:35.439
What? Folks need
to be reminded?

19:35.441 --> 19:38.408
<i> Some lawsuit money is never</i>
<i> going to make that better.</i>

19:42.348 --> 19:45.282
Listen, what we need
to do right now is-is-

19:49.022 --> 19:52.356
Dodge:
<i> Some of ellen's best</i>
<i> memories are at this school.</i>

19:52.358 --> 19:53.558
<i> Putting her name</i>
<i> on the door</i>

19:53.693 --> 19:56.293
Seems an appropriate
way to honour her.

19:56.329 --> 19:57.794
Marcus, can I have a minute?

19:59.098 --> 20:01.298
Reggie, as you can see I'm
with mr. O'halleran right now.

20:01.434 --> 20:02.499
Let's catch up later.

20:02.569 --> 20:04.435

20:05.872 --> 20:07.705
Marcus, deal with
your business.

20:07.707 --> 20:08.772
I'll look around.

20:08.841 --> 20:10.441
See what my
money's paid for.

20:13.012 --> 20:14.445
I don't want to hear
one more thing from you

20:14.580 --> 20:16.147
About professor raines
and this webpage.

20:16.282 --> 20:18.582
I told you it is
being handled.

20:18.618 --> 20:21.519
Well it's not that obvious
from my vantage point.

20:21.654 --> 20:22.520
Everybody's acting like

20:22.655 --> 20:24.989
Freedom of speech
trumps common sense.

20:25.058 --> 20:27.591
Women in this school should not
have to deal with harassment.

20:27.627 --> 20:28.726
Hold up.

20:28.728 --> 20:30.661
We are trying to
resolve this situation,

20:30.796 --> 20:31.996
But it's tough.

20:32.065 --> 20:34.665
He has tenure and his webpage
is an off-campus activity.

20:34.800 --> 20:36.934
Oh tenure. My god,
I'm sick of that word.

20:36.936 --> 20:38.602
Yeah, you're going to
hate this even more.

20:38.638 --> 20:40.604
You don't have the
protection of tenure.

20:41.540 --> 20:43.540
Are you threatening
to fire me?

20:43.576 --> 20:45.609
Nobody likes a bull
in a china shop.

20:45.612 --> 20:48.279
<i> Now, if you'll excuse me,</i>

20:48.281 --> 20:50.247
I need to get back to
keeping the lights on.

20:53.920 --> 20:56.086
My family's in
deep crisis.

20:56.122 --> 20:57.621
I wish there was something
that I can do to help

20:57.624 --> 20:58.889

20:58.891 --> 21:00.091
Yeah.

21:00.093 --> 21:01.725
I was in the midst of speaking
to him about counselling

21:01.761 --> 21:02.993
When the call came in.

21:02.996 --> 21:03.961
Cliff:
<i> Yeah, I was thinking</i>
<i> the exact same thing</i>

21:04.096 --> 21:05.696
In regards to the family,

21:05.765 --> 21:08.633
But I wondered whether
any kind of counselling

21:08.768 --> 21:11.369
Related to the church could
be triggering, you know.

21:11.504 --> 21:12.903
I have a friend who's
a great therapist.

21:12.972 --> 21:15.139
Look, pass me the phone.

21:15.274 --> 21:16.907
