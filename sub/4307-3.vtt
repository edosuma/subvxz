WEBVTT

00:00.085 --> 00:03.695
25 years ago, God disappeared.

00:03.730 --> 00:05.417
The archangel Gabriel decided

00:05.452 --> 00:08.845
he must destroy mankind
to bring God back,

00:08.880 --> 00:11.363
but the archangel Michael
stood against his brother

00:11.398 --> 00:15.171
and fought on the side
of humanity.

00:15.223 --> 00:18.508
The war continues.

00:18.560 --> 00:20.760
The Prophet built the fire
that protects us.

00:20.762 --> 00:22.238
It cannot go out.

00:22.273 --> 00:25.765
Harper, I cannot let you
put everyone else in danger.

00:27.819 --> 00:29.519
I'm leaving Vega.

00:29.571 --> 00:32.022
I've never stood still.
I'm not about to start now.

00:34.860 --> 00:36.443
- Guards!
- Drop your weapon!

00:36.445 --> 00:38.612
Why try to kill me now?

00:38.614 --> 00:40.497
You live in a palace
built with their bones.

00:40.532 --> 00:42.699
There's something in there
that I want back.

00:42.751 --> 00:44.528
Has anyone ever
made it out alive?

00:44.563 --> 00:47.203
No, but there's
always a first time.

00:47.255 --> 00:48.371
You game?

01:03.605 --> 01:05.471
What's in there?

01:05.474 --> 01:07.474
The possessed.

01:07.526 --> 01:09.476
Human body wasn't built
for occupation.

01:09.528 --> 01:11.478
Some angels can't
bear its limits.

01:11.480 --> 01:12.646
They go mad.

01:12.648 --> 01:15.148
And we keep them in here.

01:15.150 --> 01:16.199
It's an asylum...

01:16.234 --> 01:17.484
and a prison

01:17.536 --> 01:19.152
for those
who break our laws.

01:19.204 --> 01:21.154
So, a few days ago,
an angel went mad

01:21.206 --> 01:23.239
and stole a key from me,
took it in there.

01:23.291 --> 01:24.874
I sent some soldiers in
to find it.

01:24.910 --> 01:26.876
Good men,
but none of them made it back.

01:26.912 --> 01:29.329
And I'd like you
to bring it to me.

01:29.331 --> 01:30.664
You want me to go
into a madhouse

01:30.666 --> 01:33.049
full of insane angels...

01:33.085 --> 01:34.918
with just a machete
and a flashlight?

01:34.970 --> 01:38.315
Chosen One is destined to become
a great general, isn't he?

01:38.350 --> 01:39.202
So prove it to me.

01:39.237 --> 01:41.925
Show me your markings
are worth my alliance.

01:41.977 --> 01:44.060
What's the key for?

01:44.096 --> 01:46.346
That's my business.

01:46.398 --> 01:48.181
I mean, I'm looking
for a powerful weapon,

01:48.183 --> 01:50.233
and you walk into my city
claiming to be one.

01:50.268 --> 01:52.068
I mean, what are the odds?

01:52.104 --> 01:53.903
Julian.

01:53.939 --> 01:55.822
Let's see
what you're made of.

01:58.744 --> 02:00.694
Alex, don't go in there.

02:00.696 --> 02:02.362
Listen, you heard him.

02:02.364 --> 02:04.464
This is the only way
we're getting an alliance.

02:04.499 --> 02:06.700
New Delphi has soldiers
and Empyrean steel.

02:06.702 --> 02:08.283
It's the only thing
that can kill an archangel.

02:08.336 --> 02:09.369
I'm going in with you.

02:09.420 --> 02:10.870
- No, Noma.
- Alex, no way.

02:10.872 --> 02:11.871
Look out for Pete.

02:11.923 --> 02:13.707
This city's dangerous.

02:13.709 --> 02:15.291
I need you to keep Vega safe

02:15.343 --> 02:16.626
if I don't make it
out of here.

02:16.678 --> 02:18.344
I'll do it.

02:20.816 --> 02:22.632
But I need you
to get a message to Vega.

02:22.684 --> 02:24.601
Tell them Gabriel's alive.

02:24.636 --> 02:27.103
The survivors of the human race
are gonna need to stick together

02:27.139 --> 02:28.488
if we're gonna kill Gabriel.

02:28.523 --> 02:29.639
Done.

02:29.691 --> 02:31.558
So the angel in question

02:31.560 --> 02:34.894
will be wearing the key
on a chain around his neck.

02:34.946 --> 02:38.114
If you find it,
then keep moving.

02:48.076 --> 02:50.410
Good luck.

02:55.250 --> 02:58.251
Attention...
V-1 curfew is now in effect.

03:02.841 --> 03:05.008
They were killed by V-1 rebels.

03:05.060 --> 03:07.560
Zoe Holloway escaped.

03:24.079 --> 03:27.781
Laurel,
Wes murdered that girl.

03:27.783 --> 03:30.667
Harper...
her name was Harper.

03:30.702 --> 03:32.786
And we had to do it, okay?

03:32.788 --> 03:34.454
What?

03:34.506 --> 03:36.456
How can you say that?

03:36.508 --> 03:39.008
I needed her confession...

03:39.044 --> 03:41.127
all her secrets
and all her sins.

03:41.129 --> 03:43.713
She wouldn't tell me anything.
I tried.

03:45.851 --> 03:48.852
Now that she's dead,
we're safe.

03:48.887 --> 03:52.222
Whatever secrets she had
died with her.

03:52.274 --> 03:55.558
She was the last one.

03:55.610 --> 03:57.143
Now I have
everyone's confession.

03:57.145 --> 03:59.813
I'm ready for
the celebration tonight.

03:59.865 --> 04:01.648
It doesn't make sense.

04:01.650 --> 04:03.900
Why are these secrets
so important?

04:03.952 --> 04:06.035
Why does everyone
have to confess them to you?

04:10.158 --> 04:13.042
After tonight,
you'll be gone.

04:13.078 --> 04:14.544
You need their secrets
before then

04:14.579 --> 04:17.497
because it's not
a celebration.

04:17.499 --> 04:20.166
It's a sacrifice.

04:20.168 --> 04:22.000
Isn't it?

04:22.053 --> 04:25.505
- Laurel, tell me I'm wrong.
- We have to do it.

04:25.507 --> 04:29.509
Every five years,
the Prophet told us to do it,

04:29.544 --> 04:31.511
and I volunteered.

04:44.075 --> 04:46.359
That grave
isn't for Harper.

04:46.361 --> 04:48.778
No.

04:48.830 --> 04:50.363
It's for me.

04:58.935 --> 05:03.935

06:13.665 --> 06:17.033
When Vega sees their queen
has fallen, they'll lose hope,

06:17.085 --> 06:18.785
make it so much easier

06:18.837 --> 06:21.287
to wipe clean
this filthy slate.

06:24.042 --> 06:27.293
Ah, Briathos.

06:27.295 --> 06:30.713
Could you get into Vega?

06:30.765 --> 06:31.848
Then go.

06:31.883 --> 06:33.499
You deserve a holiday.

06:33.535 --> 06:35.969
And you can bring back
a souvenir,

06:35.971 --> 06:37.887
the head of Claire Riesen.

06:42.560 --> 06:45.862
My army will be here
by sundown.

06:45.897 --> 06:49.315
New Delphi won't give us Alex.
We'll liberate him.

06:51.703 --> 06:54.070
There a problem?

06:54.122 --> 06:56.372
You want to attack
two cities at once?

06:56.408 --> 06:59.190
The last time we did that,
Michael was at our side.

06:59.225 --> 07:01.517
We don't need him.

07:01.552 --> 07:03.379
I've learned a great deal
since then.

07:03.415 --> 07:05.748
And when I'm done,
Father will see

07:05.800 --> 07:09.802
who's always been
his most loyal son.

07:35.663 --> 07:39.282
Here, we strike here first.

07:39.334 --> 07:41.284
What, the temple?
No.

07:41.336 --> 07:43.134
It's a sanctuary.
Spare it.

07:43.169 --> 07:44.537
Be merciful, Michael.

07:44.539 --> 07:46.205
These people
don't deserve their God.

07:46.207 --> 07:48.541
They are still
Father's children.

07:48.543 --> 07:51.010
And yet he gives us
the task of punishment.

07:51.046 --> 07:52.378
I will do as I see fit.

07:52.380 --> 07:53.930
Brother, your blood
is too hot.

07:53.965 --> 07:55.048
And yours is too cool.

07:55.100 --> 07:56.766
We should use the Amphorae.

07:56.801 --> 07:59.385
These vessels contain darkness
to drive them to madness,

07:59.387 --> 08:01.106
brimstone to blind and burn,

08:01.141 --> 08:03.139
and blood to drown
the survivors.

08:03.191 --> 08:07.393
The elements of God's wrath
are swift, clean, honorable.

08:07.395 --> 08:09.812
Honor is to look
one's enemy in the eye.

08:09.864 --> 08:12.148
But you wouldn't know that.

08:13.902 --> 08:16.069
You've never killed a human
with your bare hands.

08:16.071 --> 08:18.280
You send soldiers to battle
and use the Amphorae,

08:18.315 --> 08:19.489
but it's not the same.

08:19.541 --> 08:21.791
You don't know
the beauty of it.

08:21.826 --> 08:24.577
In winter,
when blood spills on snow,

08:24.629 --> 08:26.746
it steams.

08:30.919 --> 08:31.918
You're insane.

08:31.920 --> 08:32.642
Michael.

08:32.677 --> 08:34.649
You think I'm just gonna stand
by and watch you kill yourself?

08:34.683 --> 08:36.756
I have to.
One of us does.

08:36.808 --> 08:39.102
One of our leaders
wouldn't do it,

08:39.136 --> 08:42.260
and then the fire went out,
and the possessed came in.

08:42.263 --> 08:44.047
They killed my friends

08:44.082 --> 08:46.229
until our leader
did what he promised.

08:46.264 --> 08:48.601
Then the fire lit again,
and we were safe.

08:48.603 --> 08:50.436
You're afraid
God won't return.

08:50.488 --> 08:51.821
So am I.

08:51.856 --> 08:54.240
You've let a false prophet
take advantage of your fear.

08:54.275 --> 08:56.578
But I hear God's voice.
We all do.

08:56.613 --> 08:57.577
But I don't!

08:57.612 --> 08:58.229
And if it were Father,

08:58.264 --> 09:00.780
I promise He would
have something to say to me!

09:00.832 --> 09:04.117
I'm one of his children too.

09:04.119 --> 09:06.953
Michael, I have
a responsibility.

09:07.005 --> 09:10.456
That mean anything to you?

09:10.458 --> 09:13.259
It did...

09:13.294 --> 09:14.293
once.

09:16.965 --> 09:19.849
Father's wrath
must have a face.

09:19.884 --> 09:21.934
And that duty is mine.

09:21.970 --> 09:24.103
How say you, Lyrae?

09:24.139 --> 09:26.439
A death is
as glorious as birth.

09:26.474 --> 09:28.808
Why else would Father
have made them mortal?

09:28.860 --> 09:30.921
Michael, you value
a higher angel's counsel

09:30.956 --> 09:32.145
over your own brother's?

09:32.147 --> 09:34.864
Justice must be done.

09:36.151 --> 09:38.868
No, I won't allow cruelty.

09:38.903 --> 09:41.120
Father's orders were
to cast these sinners

09:41.156 --> 09:42.822
out into the darkness.

09:42.824 --> 09:46.492
I want them to suffer
the limits of their bodies.

09:46.544 --> 09:48.794
Spill blood,
but do so with honor.

09:48.830 --> 09:49.829
Always.

09:49.881 --> 09:51.497
Michael...

09:56.671 --> 09:59.672
Farewell,
Sodom and Gomorrah.

10:23.865 --> 10:25.998
There, that's better.

10:26.034 --> 10:28.201
Are you afraid
of the dark, soldier?

10:30.288 --> 10:32.038
Don't be.

10:32.040 --> 10:35.208
It's lovely in the dark.

10:35.260 --> 10:37.593
Ah!

10:37.629 --> 10:39.762
Turn out the light!

10:39.797 --> 10:43.599
Turn out the light!

10:58.566 --> 10:59.999
Over here.

11:06.908 --> 11:08.324
Open!

11:11.579 --> 11:13.045
You okay, man?

11:13.081 --> 11:15.081
Yeah.

11:15.083 --> 11:16.966
Who are you?

11:17.001 --> 11:18.467
I'm from Vega.

11:18.503 --> 11:19.802
Vega?

11:22.140 --> 11:23.839
General Riesen?

11:46.030 --> 11:47.613
Wow.

11:47.665 --> 11:49.282
I didn't think
it was possible, Gates,

11:49.334 --> 11:51.284
but you have managed
to turn this place

11:51.286 --> 11:55.004
from charming hovel
to just hovel.

11:55.039 --> 11:57.423
Well, hello to you too,
Claire Riesen.

11:57.458 --> 11:58.841
And all this is the price
of genius.

11:58.876 --> 12:00.793
A little method,
little madness, you know.

12:00.845 --> 12:02.511
To what do I owe
this honor?

12:02.547 --> 12:04.463
I have a favor to ask.

12:04.465 --> 12:06.515
Oh, straight to the point,
just like your pop.

12:06.551 --> 12:07.800
Well, I'll try not
to take it personally,

12:07.802 --> 12:09.518
but I'm kind of busy, so...

12:11.522 --> 12:13.806
How busy?

12:17.145 --> 12:18.611
Where'd you find that?

12:18.646 --> 12:20.529
My dad never came
empty-handed.

12:20.565 --> 12:22.365
You are a quick study.

12:22.400 --> 12:24.150
Last time the General
brought you here,

12:24.152 --> 12:26.035
I don't think you were
even old enough to have a drink.

12:26.070 --> 12:27.370
It's been years, right?

12:27.405 --> 12:30.456
Yeah, well, things change.

12:30.491 --> 12:32.495
Gates, I need you
to find someone for me.

12:32.530 --> 12:33.869
Zoe Holloway,
she's a V-1,

12:33.904 --> 12:35.678
wants to overthrow
my government.

12:35.713 --> 12:37.797
What, did she say that
in a strongly worded letter?

12:37.832 --> 12:40.166
No, she tried to kill me.

12:40.201 --> 12:41.384
She escaped prison,

12:41.419 --> 12:43.803
and my soldiers
can't track her.

12:43.838 --> 12:45.004
But I bet you can.

12:47.041 --> 12:49.175
Claire, I'd love to help you,
but I'm an engineer.

12:49.227 --> 12:50.343
I power the city.

12:50.345 --> 12:51.811
I build you a bomb
here and there,

12:51.846 --> 12:53.012
but I don't play detective.

12:53.014 --> 12:54.146
Come on, Gates.

12:54.182 --> 12:55.481
You and my dad
built this city.

12:55.516 --> 12:59.318
You know it better than anyone.
You could find her.

12:59.354 --> 13:00.986
Please,
it's important.

13:01.022 --> 13:03.606
Yes, it is, but I can't,
not now, sorry.

13:05.576 --> 13:07.193
Gates, I'm not asking.

13:07.195 --> 13:08.994
I thought you said
that this was a favor.

13:09.030 --> 13:10.529
Yeah, well,
now it's an order.

13:10.531 --> 13:12.081
Tinker with
that thing later.

13:12.116 --> 13:14.784
You know what? This bad boy
is a processing core

13:14.836 --> 13:18.697
from a generator that powers
three floors in Agri-tower B,

13:18.732 --> 13:20.039
all stalks of corn.

13:20.091 --> 13:21.490
It went kaboom
at 3:00 a.m.

13:21.525 --> 13:22.541
So, I don't fix this,

13:22.593 --> 13:24.397
we can kiss those crops
good-bye.

13:24.432 --> 13:26.262
There are rumors
of a rebellion, Gates.

13:26.297 --> 13:28.297
You know what those
grow up into?

13:28.349 --> 13:31.600
Civil wars.

13:31.636 --> 13:36.555
It's the curse
of the Bambino.

13:36.607 --> 13:38.774
The Boston Red Sox
traded away Babe Ruth

13:38.810 --> 13:41.110
and bought the team
86 years bad luck.

13:41.145 --> 13:42.895
Michael was our Babe Ruth.

13:42.947 --> 13:44.697
After he left,
everything fell apart.

13:44.732 --> 13:48.284
I mean, he was the only angel
that gave a damn about us.

13:48.319 --> 13:51.737
Yeah, well, maybe we
never really knew him.

13:56.828 --> 13:57.652
Look, give me an hour,

13:57.687 --> 14:00.129
and I'll see
what I can do, okay?

14:01.582 --> 14:02.748
Thanks.

14:05.636 --> 14:07.803
General Riesen, what the hell
are you doing down here?

14:07.839 --> 14:09.088
"General"?

14:09.140 --> 14:10.756
Sam, you know this guy?

14:10.758 --> 14:12.258
Why'd he call you Sam?

14:12.310 --> 14:14.226
Wait.
Who the hell are you?

14:14.262 --> 14:15.261
Eli.

14:15.263 --> 14:16.762
I'm a prisoner, like him.

14:16.798 --> 14:19.098
Wait. W-why is he
calling you Sam?

14:20.768 --> 14:23.002
That's my name now.

14:23.037 --> 14:25.321
I didn't want to tell him
who I really was.

14:25.356 --> 14:26.655
Too dangerous.

14:26.691 --> 14:28.774
I've been down here
for weeks.

14:28.776 --> 14:32.411
I am the leader
of Vega.

14:32.447 --> 14:34.613
Why are you a prisoner
down here?

14:34.665 --> 14:38.584
I killed a monster,
an eight-ball.

14:38.619 --> 14:41.337
Claire... my Claire,
is she okay?

14:41.372 --> 14:42.671
She's fine.

14:42.707 --> 14:44.290
I left to protect her
and the baby.

14:44.292 --> 14:45.958
My daughter...
she's pregnant?

14:45.960 --> 14:47.510
You just left her
on her own?

14:47.545 --> 14:48.511
I told you,

14:48.546 --> 14:50.095
I left to keep her safe.

14:50.131 --> 14:52.631
I didn't just run away
like you and Michael did.

14:54.802 --> 14:56.802
There's something down here
I need to get.

14:56.804 --> 14:58.692
Some eight-ball has a key
around his neck.

14:58.727 --> 15:01.273
It's a round copper disc.

15:01.309 --> 15:03.436
But I'm starting to think
it's bullshit,

15:03.471 --> 15:05.311
and I was just sent
down here to die.

15:05.363 --> 15:08.447
No, I've seen it,
out there.

15:08.483 --> 15:09.815
But, no, look,
it's dangerous.

15:09.817 --> 15:11.700
So, no, just get us
out of here, please.

15:11.736 --> 15:13.486
No, show me the eight-ball...

15:13.538 --> 15:14.737
now.

15:26.717 --> 15:28.868
What's taking so long?

15:28.903 --> 15:31.470
Never fear.

15:31.506 --> 15:35.057
I have the perfect plan
of attack in mind.

15:50.191 --> 15:52.191
Michael...

15:59.417 --> 16:01.500
My lord, my lord!

16:01.536 --> 16:03.419
Help me!

16:03.454 --> 16:04.870
The angels have come.

16:04.922 --> 16:06.372
They'll slaughter us all.

16:06.424 --> 16:07.756
No, no, no, no, no.

16:07.792 --> 16:09.341
You are not safe here,
friend.

16:09.377 --> 16:10.543
You must go,
go now.

16:10.595 --> 16:11.877
No, no, no,
you must come too,

16:11.879 --> 16:13.762
or they'll kill you also!

16:13.798 --> 16:15.214
How we've angered God,

16:15.266 --> 16:17.383
for him to let his angels
upon us!

16:17.385 --> 16:18.801
Ah!

16:22.440 --> 16:24.523
You're one of them.

16:24.559 --> 16:26.108
Aah!

16:28.946 --> 16:30.696
Now!

16:30.731 --> 16:31.977
Go, friend, go now.

16:32.012 --> 16:32.948
I will not hurt you.

16:32.984 --> 16:34.950
You're not my friend!

16:34.986 --> 16:36.619
Aah!

17:13.839 --> 17:16.339
Are you afraid?

17:16.342 --> 17:18.342
No, I am not.

17:18.344 --> 17:19.727
Is this it?

17:22.848 --> 17:24.682
This is what you'll use?

17:24.684 --> 17:26.817
Why are you here,
Michael?

17:30.690 --> 17:32.857
I'm leaving...

17:32.859 --> 17:34.525
tonight.

17:34.527 --> 17:36.027
I know I can't change
your mind,

17:36.029 --> 17:37.445
but I won't watch you die.

17:37.497 --> 17:38.746
I can't.

17:38.781 --> 17:40.398
I wouldn't have
asked you to.

17:40.433 --> 17:42.783
I can't save you,
but there is someone I can.

17:42.835 --> 17:45.369
Alex,
the boy who's like a son.

17:45.421 --> 17:48.639
He needs me.

17:48.675 --> 17:50.875
Some promises
can't be broken.

17:53.880 --> 17:55.263
You taught me that.

17:57.884 --> 17:59.467
Good-bye, Laurel.

18:02.121 --> 18:05.723
When you came here,
you were lost.

18:05.725 --> 18:08.142
I saw in your eyes,
you were running.

18:08.194 --> 18:12.113
If you go back out there...

18:12.148 --> 18:14.732
please promise me
you'll be careful.

18:18.988 --> 18:22.490
I know you don't believe
in the things we do, but...

18:22.542 --> 18:25.242
I hope you find
something you can believe in.

18:29.165 --> 18:31.749
I have.

18:31.801 --> 18:35.987
Now I know Father's
still out there.

18:36.022 --> 18:37.505
I have faith,

18:37.557 --> 18:38.923
because He meant for me
to come here

18:38.975 --> 18:42.476
to find what I'd lost,
to find you.

18:42.512 --> 18:43.811
The world ended,

18:43.846 --> 18:45.262
but all that was good
and beautiful

18:45.264 --> 18:47.315
didn't die with it.

18:52.939 --> 18:56.023
You are afraid.

18:56.075 --> 18:57.942
Yes.

19:13.876 --> 19:15.292
Hey, what's going on?

19:15.345 --> 19:16.293
I found your rebels.

19:16.346 --> 19:18.155
- You found Zoe? Where is she?
- Uh-huh.

19:18.190 --> 19:21.799
Some abandoned warehouse

19:21.851 --> 19:24.635
behind the Flamingo.

19:24.687 --> 19:27.895
I have my eye
on every watt in the city.

19:27.930 --> 19:29.640
So when V-1s siphon off
a little juice

19:29.642 --> 19:32.026
to power a lightbulb
or a space heater,

19:32.061 --> 19:33.978
I let it go,
but this time...

19:34.030 --> 19:35.563
Huh, you do that?

19:35.615 --> 19:36.981
Yeah, why?
You want me to stop?

19:37.033 --> 19:39.817
No, just didn't know
you did it.

19:43.039 --> 19:44.905
Okay.

19:44.957 --> 19:47.334
So this warehouse is just lit up
like Times Square.

19:47.369 --> 19:49.542
Someone in there just started
using massive wattage in there,

19:49.577 --> 19:50.399
way more than a lightbulb.

19:50.434 --> 19:53.998
It could be computers,
radios, communications.

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
If your gal's trying
to start a revolution...

19:56.002 --> 19:57.835
Yeah, I get it,
command central.

19:57.887 --> 20:01.255
- Now we can get Zoe.
- Jackpot.

20:15.735 --> 20:17.552
- Thank you so much.
- Welcome.

20:23.126 --> 20:24.535
Here, sit.

20:30.753 --> 20:32.703
Gabriel, I need you.

20:36.008 --> 20:39.210
You'll pay
for what you've done!

20:39.262 --> 20:43.214
Savage, barbarian.

20:43.216 --> 20:45.466
Unspeakable.

20:45.518 --> 20:48.269
Men gutted,
hung by their entrails,

20:48.304 --> 20:51.212
babes torn limb from limb
before their mothers,

20:51.247 --> 20:52.556
and he delighted in it!

20:52.608 --> 20:55.142
Father asked for their death,
not their torture!

20:55.194 --> 20:56.694
Gabriel.

21:08.407 --> 21:09.807
Gabriel...

21:09.842 --> 21:14.462
you have killed with your own
hands for the first time.

21:14.497 --> 21:16.247
Brother.

21:19.085 --> 21:21.335
He warned us

21:21.387 --> 21:25.055
never to leave the safety
of Mallory, our home...

21:27.176 --> 21:31.343
And to rid our community
of secret and sin

21:31.378 --> 21:34.014
with confession
and sacrifice.

21:42.992 --> 21:44.715
And I, Laurel, have taken

21:44.750 --> 21:47.444
those secrets and sins
into my heart.

21:48.948 --> 21:52.533
As I die, so do they.

21:53.703 --> 21:55.619
Stop!

22:00.510 --> 22:02.793
I'm here
to take your place.

22:20.162 --> 22:23.113
Gabriel, what have you done?

22:27.670 --> 22:29.169
Archangel.

22:29.204 --> 22:31.321
Stay down!

22:31.357 --> 22:35.042
For eons, we've shed human blood
on Father's command.

22:35.094 --> 22:37.494
It's a terrible task,
but it's ours alone.

22:37.529 --> 22:39.721
But the unholy joy
you took with your duty

22:39.756 --> 22:41.181
shocked me
more than any!

22:41.216 --> 22:45.552
Is such joy
for archangels alone?

22:45.604 --> 22:48.722
For I gleaned it
all from you, Michael.

22:48.774 --> 22:51.475
Your brutality...

22:51.527 --> 22:54.194
was a glorious inspiration.

22:54.229 --> 22:58.448
You are my muse, Michael.

23:03.989 --> 23:05.155
Brother...

23:05.207 --> 23:07.157
No, Michael, you wouldn't.

23:07.209 --> 23:11.128
Lyrae, you have broken
the will of God

23:11.163 --> 23:12.079
and must be punished.

23:12.131 --> 23:13.497
No, you wouldn't, Michael.

23:13.549 --> 23:18.251
I cast you down
to the lowest sphere of Heaven.

23:18.304 --> 23:19.720
Gabriel.

23:19.755 --> 23:21.338
Gabriel, stop him.

23:21.340 --> 23:22.339
You will no longer hold

23:22.341 --> 23:24.741
the exalted rank
of higher angel,

23:24.777 --> 23:27.311
thereby your body
shall be taken from you.

23:27.346 --> 23:28.929
Stop him, Gabriel.

23:28.981 --> 23:30.314
I banish your spirit

23:30.349 --> 23:32.649
to the cold ether
of the outer sphere.

23:32.685 --> 23:34.601
Oh, what satire...

23:34.653 --> 23:37.104
that you should be judge
and executioner.

23:37.156 --> 23:38.522
To the darkness,

23:38.574 --> 23:40.991
far from the warmth
of Father's light.

23:41.026 --> 23:42.326
Gabriel!

23:56.792 --> 23:58.375
Michael.

24:01.547 --> 24:03.714
You can't do this.

24:03.716 --> 24:05.345
It won't work.

24:05.380 --> 24:07.267
Get out of here,
you son of a bitch.

24:07.302 --> 24:09.686
No, wait.
Why won't it work?

24:09.722 --> 24:11.410
You have to take the secrets
and sins of this town

24:11.445 --> 24:13.440
into your heart,
all of them.

24:13.475 --> 24:15.676
Well, you haven't
taken mine.

24:17.980 --> 24:21.565
Am I not part
of your town?

24:21.567 --> 24:23.483
You gave me shelter,

24:23.535 --> 24:25.240
fought the enemy
shoulder to shoulder.

24:25.275 --> 24:27.077
So, unless she takes
my secrets too,

24:27.112 --> 24:29.814
then all of this
is for nothing.

24:29.849 --> 24:33.126
- You don't belong here.
- No, he's right.

24:33.162 --> 24:34.828
He's one of us.

24:36.131 --> 24:37.714
Michael, will you confess

24:37.750 --> 24:39.716
your secrets
and your sins to me?

24:39.752 --> 24:41.418
I have killed.

24:41.420 --> 24:43.303
No.

24:43.338 --> 24:46.423
No, I have slaughtered.

24:46.475 --> 24:49.760
Cities so scorched,
no life may ever grow again.

24:49.762 --> 24:53.797
My fury destroyed the innocent
and the guilty

24:53.832 --> 24:56.600
and those I loved.

24:56.635 --> 24:57.637
I was the one
who passed judgment,

24:57.672 --> 25:01.154
but it's I who
must be judged.

25:01.190 --> 25:03.106
I have to take your place
as sacrifice.

25:03.108 --> 25:04.741
You give me the secrets
to carry.

25:04.777 --> 25:06.109
I'll take them with me.

25:06.111 --> 25:07.944
Michael, you can't.

25:07.946 --> 25:10.280
I won't let you.

25:10.282 --> 25:13.617
I'm not the man
you think I am,

25:13.619 --> 25:15.452
but I can be
if you'll let me.

25:15.454 --> 25:16.870
You're crazy.

25:16.922 --> 25:18.839
It won't work.

25:36.308 --> 25:39.476
It will work.

25:39.528 --> 25:42.479
Father just told me it would.

25:46.201 --> 25:47.818
Why do they take the eyes?

25:47.820 --> 25:50.353
They're jealous
of us.

25:50.389 --> 25:52.072
I came here once.

25:52.124 --> 25:54.991
It was a military
defense bunker...

25:55.043 --> 25:57.494
big, like NORAD.

26:04.169 --> 26:05.469
You don't look so good.

26:05.504 --> 26:07.170
Well, I'm sick.

26:07.222 --> 26:10.006
It's my heart.

26:10.008 --> 26:11.675
Did you know
about the eight-balls

26:11.677 --> 26:13.009
before you came here,

26:13.061 --> 26:14.511
that they live peacefully
with humans?

26:14.513 --> 26:17.764
Why would you think that?

26:17.816 --> 26:19.349
Maybe somebody told you.

26:39.653 --> 26:41.217
_

26:41.252 --> 26:43.008
_

26:45.427 --> 26:47.954
I'm gonna need that key.

26:47.989 --> 26:50.881
Ah, you son of a bi...

27:01.434 --> 27:04.978
Oh. Oh, God. Damn it.

27:19.294 --> 27:21.494
Oh.

27:53.314 --> 27:55.148
Sanctify this vessel.

27:55.183 --> 27:56.649
Protect this body and soul.

27:56.701 --> 27:58.151
What are you doing?

27:58.153 --> 27:59.986
Come into the light.

28:22.010 --> 28:24.677
What did you just do?
How did you do that?

28:27.849 --> 28:30.016
Get up. Come on, get up.

28:33.938 --> 28:36.522
- You all right?
- Yeah.

28:36.574 --> 28:38.157
These missions
made my dad crazy.

28:38.193 --> 28:40.693
He used to hate
not being on the ground.

28:40.695 --> 28:42.862
Lady Riesen,
they're approaching target.

28:42.914 --> 28:44.197
I want Zoe Holloway
taken alive,

28:44.249 --> 28:45.781
but if she resists,
shoot to kill.

28:45.834 --> 28:46.949
Ma'am.

28:47.001 --> 28:48.835
Let's move. Move.

28:52.173 --> 28:55.174
- Your side, your side.
- Covered.

28:55.210 --> 28:57.176
Come out!
Show me your hands!

28:57.212 --> 28:59.378
Stand clear.

29:01.114 --> 29:03.883
It's clear.
No sign of Holloway.

29:03.935 --> 29:05.051
What?

29:05.053 --> 29:07.386
- Here!
- Go! Move!

29:10.058 --> 29:12.024
Movement!

29:13.695 --> 29:14.894
Get down on the ground!

29:14.896 --> 29:16.395
Wait, wait, wait.
That's Zoe.

29:16.447 --> 29:17.396
Go, go, go!

29:17.448 --> 29:20.449
Move it out!

29:20.485 --> 29:21.901
Damn it, he had her.

29:21.903 --> 29:23.730
Left side! Left side!

29:26.791 --> 29:30.743
Michael, when you came to us,
you were a stranger.

29:30.795 --> 29:33.746
Now you belong to us.

29:33.748 --> 29:36.772
Will you take the secrets
and sins of our town

29:36.807 --> 29:38.084
into your heart?

29:38.136 --> 29:41.087
Yes, I will.

29:59.607 --> 30:02.108
It should be me.

30:02.160 --> 30:05.077
Your grace is a light
that shines in the darkness.

30:05.113 --> 30:07.947
It's what's going
to lead Father home.

30:09.301 --> 30:10.866
Hey.

30:32.841 --> 30:35.092
_

30:39.030 --> 30:40.363
It's happening.

30:47.163 --> 30:49.372
I, Michael,

30:49.407 --> 30:52.708
take the secrets and sins
of my people into my heart.

30:52.744 --> 30:57.496
As I die, so do they.

31:10.845 --> 31:12.345
Thank you.

31:21.356 --> 31:23.689
It'll work.

31:23.691 --> 31:25.358
It has to.

31:44.429 --> 31:46.212
Michael.

32:00.728 --> 32:04.030
Father's will be done.

32:06.567 --> 32:09.235
What are you doing?

32:09.237 --> 32:10.903
Lyrae spoke the truth.

32:10.938 --> 32:12.405
I am Father's sword.

32:12.457 --> 32:14.206
I, too, must be punished.

32:14.242 --> 32:15.541
No.

32:15.576 --> 32:18.077
Gabriel, please, I beg you.

32:18.079 --> 32:21.464
Never.

32:21.499 --> 32:23.582
I'll sooner
take my own life.

32:28.139 --> 32:31.173
Forgive me.

32:31.225 --> 32:35.261
I shamed you for your mercy,
for the light inside you,

32:35.313 --> 32:37.646
a light I covet.

32:37.682 --> 32:39.982
Mine has long since
gone dim.

32:40.017 --> 32:41.600
I fear it will not kindle.

32:43.071 --> 32:46.856
It can, and it will.

32:53.197 --> 32:55.331
No more, brother.

32:55.366 --> 32:57.500
I'm done.

33:00.538 --> 33:03.372
Perhaps we are
never truly done.

33:49.053 --> 33:52.004
Thank you.

34:08.699 --> 34:10.899
Sergeant Mills,
please, take a seat.

34:10.951 --> 34:12.534
I wanted to thank you
for your efforts

34:12.569 --> 34:13.534
in tonight's mission.

34:13.570 --> 34:14.770
Well, thank you, Lady Riesen.

34:14.804 --> 34:16.455
Sergeant,
why did you hesitate...

34:16.489 --> 34:17.505
when you missed the shot?

34:17.541 --> 34:18.956
You could have captured Zoe.

34:18.993 --> 34:19.975
It was dark.

34:20.010 --> 34:21.092
My team was close.

34:21.128 --> 34:23.045
I didn't want to hit
anyone else by mistake.

34:23.080 --> 34:24.246
You don't make mistakes.

34:24.297 --> 34:26.735
Expert marksman,
best in your unit, I hear...

34:26.771 --> 34:28.967
flawless on a 500-yard
moving-target test.

34:29.003 --> 34:31.062
How far away was Zoe?
50, 60 yards?

34:31.097 --> 34:33.221
Lady Riesen,
I'm sorry I missed.

34:33.257 --> 34:35.757
But that's not a crime,
is it?

34:35.809 --> 34:37.309
No...

34:37.344 --> 34:39.011
not unless you did it
on purpose.

34:39.063 --> 34:41.563
What?

34:41.598 --> 34:44.900
Claire, I've got...

34:44.935 --> 34:46.464
I'm sorry, Lady Riesen.

34:46.498 --> 34:48.853
It can wait.

34:48.906 --> 34:51.706
Look, I told you,
it was dark.

34:51.741 --> 34:53.063
I didn't want to hit
one of my guys.

34:53.098 --> 34:54.493
You had a clear shot.

34:54.527 --> 34:56.328
Oh, yeah? What the hell
do you know about guns?

34:56.362 --> 34:58.332
Corporal, give me
your Beretta.

35:04.922 --> 35:06.004
Now...

35:06.040 --> 35:07.789
I'm no expert or anything,

35:07.841 --> 35:09.891
but at that range
with a clear shot,

35:09.927 --> 35:12.127
even I wouldn't have missed.

35:12.179 --> 35:14.346
Sergeant Mills,

35:14.381 --> 35:17.349
how many other traitors
are there in my military?

35:21.221 --> 35:23.472
Go to hell, you bitch.

35:27.895 --> 35:29.895
Take him out.

35:37.071 --> 35:39.154
Come on,
the exit's up this way.

35:39.206 --> 35:40.706
Come on.
General, come on!

35:40.741 --> 35:41.823
No, I can't go.

35:41.875 --> 35:43.241
It's right here,
come on!

35:43.293 --> 35:44.576
Come on, General.

35:44.628 --> 35:46.545
Come on, you got it.

35:46.580 --> 35:47.963
- I can't make it.
- Come on, buddy.

35:47.998 --> 35:49.531
I can't. I can't.

35:49.566 --> 35:50.732
Shit!

35:57.508 --> 35:59.474
Open the door!

35:59.510 --> 36:01.343
- Alex?
- Open the door!

36:04.848 --> 36:06.093
Alex, you son of a bitch.

36:06.128 --> 36:07.849
I never thought you
were coming out of there.

36:07.901 --> 36:09.434
Thanks, Noma.

36:12.523 --> 36:14.940
Uh, who's this guy?

36:17.077 --> 36:19.027
Riesen?

36:20.614 --> 36:22.497
General.

36:22.533 --> 36:24.116
Ah.

36:29.881 --> 36:31.706
Lady Riesen.

36:41.218 --> 36:42.717
Don't tell me
you're praying.

36:42.770 --> 36:44.519
No, I used to,

36:44.555 --> 36:48.273
but I don't find comfort
in it anymore.

36:48.308 --> 36:50.078
Faith helps little children
sleep at night,

36:50.113 --> 36:52.477
but it won't help me
protect my city.

36:54.898 --> 36:58.033
You know what?

36:58.068 --> 37:00.152
I did not recognize
you before.

37:00.204 --> 37:02.988
Hmm, I didn't
recognize myself.

37:05.375 --> 37:07.644
Curse of the Bambino
lasted 86 years, right?

37:07.679 --> 37:08.960
Not 87.

37:08.996 --> 37:11.913
The Red Sox
didn't give up.

37:11.965 --> 37:14.049
Neither will I.

37:14.084 --> 37:15.717
Well, I'd bet on you.

37:18.388 --> 37:19.754
Ah.
You know what?

37:19.807 --> 37:22.757
A lot has changed,
but not that smile.

37:27.648 --> 37:29.264
So...

37:29.266 --> 37:32.067
what did you want?

37:32.102 --> 37:33.518
Um...

37:33.570 --> 37:36.021
surveillance camera caught
a shot of your rebels

37:36.073 --> 37:37.155
when they escaped,

37:37.191 --> 37:39.574
and, uh, that's one
of the crates

37:39.610 --> 37:42.911
the Agri-tower guys
use to deliver food.

37:42.946 --> 37:43.701
I don't understand.

37:43.736 --> 37:45.382
They left behind
all their gear and guns,

37:45.417 --> 37:47.082
and they took this... why?

37:47.117 --> 37:48.533
What's in it?

37:48.585 --> 37:50.752
I don't think it's corn.

37:55.292 --> 37:57.292
Hey, my key...
do you have it?

37:57.344 --> 37:59.878
Yes, I do.

37:59.930 --> 38:01.513
No one's made it
out of there alive.

38:01.548 --> 38:03.265
Orpheus only escaped
the underworld

38:03.300 --> 38:06.434
because he had
a magic lyre.

38:06.470 --> 38:07.853
How did you do it?

38:07.888 --> 38:10.055
Like you said,
I'm a powerful weapon.

38:10.107 --> 38:12.161
Now I want my alliance.

38:15.112 --> 38:17.729
Oh, no, that man's
a murderer.

38:17.781 --> 38:19.281
He killed an angel
in my city.

38:19.316 --> 38:21.283
Take him back to the asylum,
where he belongs.

38:21.318 --> 38:24.819
That is General Edward Riesen
of Vega.

38:24.872 --> 38:26.967
Part of the pact
between our two cities,

38:27.002 --> 38:28.156
which you now owe me...

38:28.208 --> 38:30.676
you'll pardon
all of his crimes.

38:35.132 --> 38:36.915
Find them quarters.

38:36.967 --> 38:39.467
You have your alliance.
Welcome to New Delphi.

38:40.671 --> 38:43.004
All of you.

38:49.513 --> 38:52.347
Let's talk about Vega.

39:32.034 --> 39:33.981
Sweet dreams.

39:34.017 --> 39:35.032
Jeez.

39:37.954 --> 39:40.454
Please, don't hurt me.

39:40.490 --> 39:42.990
Oh, but I will, Wes...

39:43.026 --> 39:45.117
much more
than just hurt you.

39:45.152 --> 39:48.896
It'll pale in comparison
to what you did to Harper.

39:48.932 --> 39:52.400
You see, killing was
once a speciality of mine.

39:52.435 --> 39:53.509
That's all behind me now.

39:53.544 --> 39:56.604
But for you,
I'd make an exception.

39:56.639 --> 39:59.473
Lay a hand on anyone else,
and I'll destroy you.

39:59.526 --> 40:02.143
Speak of this to no one.
I'll be watching.

40:02.145 --> 40:04.312
Am I understood?
