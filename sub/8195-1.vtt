51:24.880 --> 51:30.087

51:30.956 --> 51:33.842
Yes, it will comming.

51:40.063 --> 51:43.266
There he is.

51:44.192 --> 51:49.104
Yes, it's all in there
just like you told me.

51:49.281 --> 51:52.616
I hope this idear of yours
is going to be working.

51:52.786 --> 51:55.112
I hope so too.

51:59.043 --> 52:03.255
We is lost.
- No we're not. We must be nearly there.

52:03.423 --> 52:06.022
Well, I's hearing duck quackeling
down below.

52:06.299 --> 52:07.742
We's in the countryside.

52:08.762 --> 52:13.341
No, it must be St. James' Park.
Fly down.

52:21.360 --> 52:25.600
That's Buckingham Palace over there.
Come on.

52:36.627 --> 52:40.354
Where is the queen sleeping, Sofie?
- I do not know.

52:40.683 --> 52:43.464
We have to search.

52:45.952 --> 52:46.447
No.

52:48.007 --> 52:48.551
No.

52:49.487 --> 52:52.716
Only some doggies in there.

52:55.774 --> 52:59.854
This is a lady. Take a look-see.

53:08.371 --> 53:11.705
Yes, That's her.

53:41.909 --> 53:43.493
Now we just have to wait.

53:44.454 --> 53:49.081
You shure you will be alright?
- Yes.

53:52.964 --> 53:54.588
By.

54:00.013 --> 54:02.765
Please, don't eat me.

54:05.144 --> 54:08.679
All the other giants are kannibaly,
muderfull....

54:08.856 --> 54:12.476
My name is Sofie.
- I is a nice giant.

54:12.653 --> 54:17.896
Eat him. Crack his bones up. Yeah.

54:19.202 --> 54:23.330
The BFG. That's me.

54:24.958 --> 54:26.785
No.

54:26.960 --> 54:29.710
There'll be lots more disappearings tonight.

54:29.731 --> 54:33.506
I don't want to be saved,
I want to save the other children.

54:33.611 --> 54:37.130
A whole school,
with little girls in it.

54:37.348 --> 54:38.445
No. No.

54:40.468 --> 54:41.334
No, don't let them do it.

54:42.012 --> 54:43.412
- We've got to stop them.

54:45.604 --> 54:46.675
We go to the queen.

55:38.917 --> 55:40.875
Good morning, Your Majesty.

55:43.589 --> 55:47.967
Oh, it is a nice day outside, ma'am.
- is it?

55:49.441 --> 55:53.473
O Mary,
I've had the most awefull nightmare.

55:55.160 --> 55:59.985
I dreamed that great gastly Giants were snatching
little boys and girls out of their beds at school...

56:01.040 --> 56:03.274
... and eating them.

56:04.988 --> 56:07.308
Mary, what on earths the matter?

56:07.476 --> 56:10.565
It's your dream, ma'am.
It's in the papers.

56:10.732 --> 56:11.792
In the papers?

56:13.129 --> 56:14.249
Oh, Good heavens.

56:15.693 --> 56:20.523
Tragic horror as children slain.
Bones found beneath dormatory windows.

56:21.799 --> 56:24.255
Oh, how absolutly frightful.

56:32.634 --> 56:35.601
Oh, how did you get in there?

56:37.609 --> 56:39.592
I, I simply don't believe it.

56:40.486 --> 56:42.806
I don't know what this
place is comming to, really I don't

56:43.072 --> 56:46.816
Now, come on downstairs.
Oh, you'll be sorry, you will.

56:47.159 --> 56:49.078
No, Mary, wait a moment.

56:50.378 --> 56:52.117
Now, tell me truthfully...

56:53.334 --> 56:55.857
... is there's a little girl
on the windowsill?

56:56.161 --> 57:00.128
Yes, ma'am. there is, ma'am.
As plain as the nose on me face..

57:00.300 --> 57:05.343
Yes, but you see, I dreamed there
would be a little girl sitting there.

57:05.358 --> 57:11.702
Oh, Well, well, there is ma'am, isn't there.
I mean look.

57:13.024 --> 57:15.562
Little girl, come here please.

57:26.205 --> 57:29.260
You are real, aren't you?
- Yes, Your Majesty.

57:30.479 --> 57:36.127
And your name is Sofie?
- Yes, Your Majesty.

57:36.300 --> 57:38.922
You were the girl in my dream.

57:39.095 --> 57:39.967
How did you get in?

57:40.158 --> 57:42.390
She wan't there last night, ma'am,
I'll swear to it.

57:43.266 --> 57:47.514
I think you dreamed that, you Majesty.
- Yes...

57:49.106 --> 57:50.766
...yes, I did.

57:51.708 --> 57:57.953
I dreamed that a very tall Giant put you there,
and that he's waiting outside now in the garden.

57:57.980 --> 58:01.954
That's right, he is.
- Oh, O Lord preserve us.

58:02.502 --> 58:08.252
You needn't be frightend,
he's my friend. He's lovely.

58:08.420 --> 58:13.296
I'm sure he is, but why have
you and your friend come to see me.

58:13.467 --> 58:18.972
Didn't you dream that as well your Majesty?
- Yes.

58:19.140 --> 58:22.889
No you come to mention it...I did.

58:23.061 --> 58:26.810
You were going to help us
capture those terrible monsters.

58:26.982 --> 58:28.143
The ones who ate the children.

58:29.338 --> 58:31.181
I don't think I'm feeling very well.

58:31.391 --> 58:32.695
You did dream it.

58:33.127 --> 58:36.462
But how did you know what I was dreaming?

58:36.619 --> 58:39.706
The BFG can explain that,
if you let me call him.

58:40.790 --> 58:45.037
BFG?
- That stands for Big Friendly Giant.

58:45.211 --> 58:48.082
He's... -... in the garden. I know.

58:48.256 --> 58:50.926
Very well, Sofie. You may call him.

58:57.517 --> 59:00.393
BFG, you can come out now.

59:04.618 --> 59:10.473
Giants in the garden. I never heard
anything so ridiculous in all my born, Oh...

59:28.041 --> 59:29.336
Here he is.

59:30.330 --> 59:34.134
This is the B...F...G.

59:35.854 --> 59:41.622
Your Majester, I is your humbug servant.

59:42.609 --> 59:44.649
We are very pleased to meet you.

59:44.820 --> 59:51.358
O Qeen, O Majester,
O Golden Sovereign, O Sultana.

59:51.433 --> 59:54.919
I is comming here
with my little friend, Sofie

59:55.394 --> 59:58.248
To save you from...
...Awefull Barrel.

59:58.867 --> 01:00:00.670
He means Perril.

01:00:00.673 --> 01:00:02.873
He does speak a bit funny sometimes.

01:00:03.140 --> 01:00:06.280
I think you speak english perfectly.

01:00:06.548 --> 01:00:12.276
O Majester. How wondercrump.

01:00:14.492 --> 01:00:16.712
I is all of a, a shudder.

01:00:19.568 --> 01:00:23.270
I has great secrets to tell you Majester.

01:00:23.050 --> 01:00:25.187
I should be delighted to hear them.

01:00:26.326 --> 01:00:27.899
Would you care to join us for breakfast?

01:00:28.152 --> 01:00:31.998
Oh, will it be stinky
snoscumbers, Majister?

01:00:31.999 --> 01:00:32.860
I beg you pardon.

01:00:33.116 --> 01:00:34.292
No, it won't.

01:00:35.503 --> 01:00:39.797
It'll be something nice like...
eggs and baccon.

01:00:39.966 --> 01:00:45.553
Mary, call Mr. Tipps about breakfast,
would you? Mary? Mary?

01:00:45.722 --> 01:00:47.596
Oh, dear.

01:00:55.042 --> 01:00:59.058
It's getting better every time, this,
eggs and bakeing.

01:01:00.073 --> 01:01:03.751
Thank you, sir.
Chief will be delighted to know that.

01:01:04.409 --> 01:01:09.997
Oh, Tipps, while Mr. BFG is finishing breakfast
would you summon the head of the army...

01:01:10.151 --> 01:01:13.954
... and the Air Force.
Say it's an emergency.

01:01:14.130 --> 01:01:15.754
Very good ma'am.

01:01:21.222 --> 01:01:24.472
Doesn't yous have any fropskottel
here? For wizzpopping?

01:01:24.642 --> 01:01:26.220
No. Shh.

01:01:26.394 --> 01:01:32.569
Oh, well, I cans be wizzpopping...
without...if I wants to.

01:01:32.575 --> 01:01:37.065
-Well you musn't.
Wha...no wizzpopping?

01:01:37.239 --> 01:01:42.317
None jullifying music?
- Oh, do let him sing if he wants.

01:01:42.495 --> 01:01:46.364
He doesn't wamt to sing.
- I enjoy music at breakfast.

01:01:46.542 --> 01:01:49.069
In Scotland they played the
bagpipes outside my window.

01:01:50.423 --> 01:01:53.854
Wizzpopping is better than baglpipes,
Majister.

01:01:54.046 --> 01:01:58.222
Ah, Ha, Ha, I'm sure it is.
Please play something.

01:01:58.555 --> 01:02:00.216
No, you're not to.

01:02:00.391 --> 01:02:05.267
I cannot be disobeying,
Her Majister, the Queen.

01:02:20.635 --> 01:02:22.224
I think, on the whole...

01:02:23.123 --> 01:02:24.924
...I prefer the bagpipe.

01:02:27.613 --> 01:02:29.581
I suppose it's about these bally children.

01:02:29.885 --> 01:02:30.534
What children?

01:02:30.853 --> 01:02:32.469
The ones who have
dissapeared last night.

01:02:33.116 --> 01:02:35.084
Oh, them, load of nonsense.

01:02:35.964 --> 01:02:38.051
You know what children are?
They make it all up.

01:02:38.241 --> 01:02:41.770
Yes...They did find bones, though,
and Giant footprints.

01:02:41.922 --> 01:02:45.001
Bones? Rubbish.
Giant footprints? Poppycock.

01:02:45.505 --> 01:02:47.267
They make it all up I tell ya.

01:02:47.426 --> 01:02:50.130
Yes, of course.
They're always causing bally trouble.

01:02:55.438 --> 01:02:56.421
Good morning, Your Majesty.

01:02:56.702 --> 01:02:57.637
Good morning, Your Majesty.

01:02:57.982 --> 01:02:59.533
Good morning, gentlemen.

01:03:00.025 --> 01:03:01.408
Thank you for comming so quickly.

01:03:02.006 --> 01:03:04.594
Tipps said it was an
emergency, your Majesty.

01:03:05.214 --> 01:03:08.963
Yes, you have heard the dreadful
news of the dissapearing children?

01:03:08.995 --> 01:03:12.666
Oh, yeah. Absolute load of poppy...
Mm, Mm, Hm...

01:03:12.754 --> 01:03:13.426
...What?

01:03:14.096 --> 01:03:18.712
Oh, Oh, absolutely shocking, Your Majesty.
Terrible.

01:03:18.827 --> 01:03:21.216
For sure there's a perfectly
simple explanation.

01:03:21.311 --> 01:03:24.736
There is. They were eaten by Giants.

01:03:27.098 --> 01:03:30.034
Don't think we shoud jump
to that conclusion, ma'am.

01:03:30.791 --> 01:03:31.310
You don't?

01:03:31.767 --> 01:03:34.023
Oh, well, Giants, your Majesty...

01:03:34.583 --> 01:03:37.095
...I mean, uh, we know the don't, uh...
...Well...

01:03:38.024 --> 01:03:38.907
Yes?

01:03:38.933 --> 01:03:43.065
Um..exsist...
do they? Uh, Anymore. What?

01:03:43.139 --> 01:03:44.307
You see, you Majesty...

01:03:45.186 --> 01:03:48.009
Let's take this business
of the footprints...

01:03:48.686 --> 01:03:52.398
...our intellegence says
they were six feet long.

01:03:52.908 --> 01:03:53.860
Yes.

01:03:54.052 --> 01:03:56.564
Well that means that
if they were real footprints...

01:03:56.974 --> 01:03:58.678
...whatever made them would have to be...

01:03:59.514 --> 01:04:01.490
...well, let me see, how high?

01:04:03.697 --> 01:04:05.357
That high?

01:04:06.305 --> 01:04:07.819
Yes, at least that...

01:04:10.561 --> 01:04:11.865
Wha...? Uh..?

01:04:12.473 --> 01:04:14.856
D, Do, Don't worry, you Majesty.
We'll protect you.

01:04:15.467 --> 01:04:18.868
It's alright, little girl,
D, D, D, Don't be frightened.

01:04:19.760 --> 01:04:22.421
Gentlemen, may I intruduce: Sofie.

01:04:22.853 --> 01:04:24.589
How, How, How do you do?
How do you do?

01:04:25.440 --> 01:04:28.338
And this is our friend: Mr. BFG.

01:04:28.768 --> 01:04:30.818
Go, Good, Good morning, Sir.
- Good morning, Sir.

01:04:32.067 --> 01:04:37.467
Ooo gunghumers and bogswinkels.
What is that?

01:04:38.153 --> 01:04:40.858
It was Louis XV.

01:04:40.899 --> 01:04:44.027
Alright men, ats your easles.

01:04:44.549 --> 01:04:48.964
Now, I should like you to listen very
carefully to what he has to say.

01:04:51.008 --> 01:04:55.207
Good heavens. What an appoling story.

01:04:55.859 --> 01:04:58.083
How many of these bruts are there?

01:04:58.154 --> 01:05:06.796
Um, Well, there's Man Hunger,
Meat Dripper, Child Chewer, Butcher Boy...

01:05:06.964 --> 01:05:08.980
... Um...
- The Blood Bottler.

01:05:09.056 --> 01:05:11.343
Yes, yes, Blood Bottler,
Maid Masher,

01:05:11.624 --> 01:05:15.576
The Flesh Lumpeater,
Oh and Bones Cruncher...

01:05:16.615 --> 01:05:18.310
... the Gizzard Gulper...

01:05:20.159 --> 01:05:22.153
That, that, that is...um...

01:05:23.120 --> 01:05:25.196
Nine.
- Yes, nine.

01:05:25.223 --> 01:05:26.713
Gosh, as many as that, eh?

01:05:27.107 --> 01:05:29.410
- Strategy is quite simple,
your Majesty....

01:05:30.514 --> 01:05:31.034
Tanks.

01:05:31.434 --> 01:05:33.586
Tanks? Nonsense.
Bombs.

01:05:33.786 --> 01:05:35.642
Bombs? Ridiculous.

01:05:36.261 --> 01:05:38.608
Tanks and heavy artillery.

01:05:38.646 --> 01:05:40.038
Artillery? Piffel.

01:05:40.562 --> 01:05:42.535
Next thing you'll be
wanting bally cavalry too.

01:05:42.731 --> 01:05:45.887
Tanks, artillery and cavalry.
That'll do it.

01:05:45.995 --> 01:05:48.407
Modern warfare, ma'am,
demands modern technology.

01:05:49.175 --> 01:05:51.548
Low-level assalt bommers
to get under their raidar...

01:05:52.088 --> 01:05:55.147
...high explosive bombs...
...heat seaking rockets...

01:05:55.544 --> 01:05:57.882
...and pow, we'll blow them to peices.

01:05:58.106 --> 01:06:00.351
It's an old fassioned enemy, ma'am...

01:06:00.937 --> 01:06:03.081
...we need good old fassioned tactics.

01:06:04.328 --> 01:06:05.661
Soften them up with bombardment...

01:06:06.312 --> 01:06:07.180
...roll in the tanks...

01:06:07.936 --> 01:06:09.828
...and pick 'em off
with machine guns.

01:06:10.642 --> 01:06:12.082
Taka, taka, taka, taka, taka

01:06:12.289 --> 01:06:13.639
We'll mow 'em down.

01:06:13.857 --> 01:06:15.927
Pow, Kaboom...Bombs.

01:06:16.096 --> 01:06:17.775
Taka, taka, taka, taka, taka..
Kaput.

01:06:18.790 --> 01:06:19.354
Tanks!

01:06:19.854 --> 01:06:20.202
Kaboom!

01:06:20.622 --> 01:06:20.826
Kaput!

01:06:21.208 --> 01:06:24.272
- Gentelmen.
Yes, Your Majesty.

01:06:25.375 --> 01:06:28.487
There will be no bombs...
and guns.

01:06:29.240 --> 01:06:29.967
- Beg pardon, ma'am

01:06:30.781 --> 01:06:34.031
The Giants are not to be hurt.
- Not hurt, ma'am?..

01:06:34.201 --> 01:06:36.459
...but they eat children.
They, They're murderers.

01:06:37.380 --> 01:06:39.483
That is no reason to
follow their example.

01:06:39.623 --> 01:06:40.753
Exunctly.

01:06:41.267 --> 01:06:43.907
Two rights is not makeing a left.

01:06:44.386 --> 01:06:46.570
But that ties us big as ears.

01:06:47.078 --> 01:06:50.102
How can we capture them without guns?
- And without bombs.

01:06:50.346 --> 01:06:51.126
I know a way.

01:06:51.290 --> 01:06:53.942

01:06:57.947 --> 01:07:00.755
Well, of course, it can be done. Can't it?

01:07:01.358 --> 01:07:03.886
Oh, Yes, yes, of course it can.

01:07:04.627 --> 01:07:05.243
How?

01:07:06.237 --> 01:07:09.251
Well, the Giants go
out at night, you see...

01:07:09.410 --> 01:07:14.265
...so in the daytime they're
fast asleep. So, if you...

01:07:48.267 --> 01:07:50.443
Blimey, he's a big feller, in't he.

01:08:07.591 --> 01:08:09.647

01:10:36.467 --> 01:10:42.805

BFG, come back.

01:15:52.454 --> 01:15:55.841

01:15:56.963 --> 01:16:00.073
I does not want to be a coward.

01:16:00.375 --> 01:16:04.759
You're not a coward. I'm Sorry.

01:16:52.302 --> 01:16:58.767
Then I kill you.

01:17:03.930 --> 01:17:04.682

01:17:07.168 --> 01:17:10.371
No, leave him alone.

But what was it a dream about?

01:23:26.349 --> 01:23:28.987
For Sofie, who has nowhere to live...

01:23:29.433 --> 01:23:32.345
...now that we have closed
down Ms. Clonkers Orphanage...

01:23:33.625 --> 01:23:36.803
...we are making a new home here,
in our Palace.

01:23:38.207 --> 01:23:40.348

for as long as they wish.

01:23:44.425 --> 01:23:47.721
