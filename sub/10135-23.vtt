Alright, we have no choice.

07:55.183 --> 07:57.769

Oh, one more thing.

I can doggy sit.

08:13.701 --> 08:16.455

08:28.216 --> 08:30.427
Will these doggy doodles

It's Pete.

08:52.366 --> 08:55.327
Sorry, it's kinda last minute.

08:55.369 --> 08:56.995

Ah, well that means that Pete,

09:06.004 --> 09:09.132
you'll be driving, huh?

09:09.174 --> 09:10.967
Do you have, uh,

09:21.228 --> 09:22.521
I'm clean.

09:22.562 --> 09:23.897
Ask my parole officer.

09:27.650 --> 09:29.236

Dad, could you lay off

09:33.323 --> 09:35.742

You rented a tuxedo

09:58.432 --> 10:00.350
for your dummy?

10:01.684 --> 10:04.104
Yeah, and he looks

10:01.684 --> 10:04.104
pretty snappy, doesn't he?

10:05.897 --> 10:09.234
Yeah, except for the shoes.

10:05.897 --> 10:09.234
They gave me two lefties.

10:23.081 --> 10:25.750
Ah, that's a relief.

10:23.081 --> 10:25.750
D.J. just went out with him.

10:25.792 --> 10:27.419
What? You let her

10:25.792 --> 10:27.419
go out with that animal?

10:28.920 --> 10:30.422
You just said

10:28.920 --> 10:30.422
he was a pretty good kid.

10:30.464 --> 10:32.840
He's in a band.

10:30.464 --> 10:32.840
All he thinks about is girls.

10:32.882 --> 10:35.552
He's exactly how I was at 17.

He's a legend.

10:44.311 --> 10:46.146
Girls throw themselves at him.

10:46.187 --> 10:48.607
They say he's

10:46.187 --> 10:48.607
never heard the word no.

10:52.360 --> 10:54.028
And D.J.'s out with him?

10:54.070 --> 10:55.989
I would love

10:54.070 --> 10:55.989
to be D.J. right now

Well, at least I have a date.

11:41.326 --> 11:43.077
Hmm.

You behave yourself.

Ha ha ha!

11:53.046 --> 11:54.797
Good boy, Comet.

11:59.427 --> 12:01.513
Comet did his business.

12:02.305 --> 12:03.931
Then he gets a treat.

12:03.973 --> 12:07.852
I wish I got a treat

12:03.973 --> 12:07.852
every time I did my business.

12:09.062 --> 12:10.564
Let's go play, Comet.

12:13.233 --> 12:15.902
Okay, let's see

12:13.233 --> 12:15.902
what's on the menu.

12:15.943 --> 12:17.278
As if you had a choice.

12:21.157 --> 12:22.409
Strained squash.

12:23.535 --> 12:25.119
Ew!

12:25.161 --> 12:26.538
I just remembered,

12:25.161 --> 12:26.538
I once had

12:26.580 --> 12:28.956
a traumatic experience

12:26.580 --> 12:28.956
with squash.

12:28.998 --> 12:30.749
I had to eat it.

12:30.791 --> 12:32.335
Here, you feed 'em.

12:32.377 --> 12:34.128
It's your job.

12:38.966 --> 12:42.178
Alright, Kimmy,

12:38.966 --> 12:42.178
I'll feed 'em.

12:42.220 --> 12:43.597
But it will cost you.

12:43.638 --> 12:46.474
- How about a dime?

12:43.638 --> 12:46.474
- How about a dollar?

12:47.392 --> 12:48.518
Deal.

12:49.394 --> 12:51.938
Per kid. Burps are extra.

someone actually went

13:07.912 --> 13:09.330
to the drive-in

13:07.912 --> 13:09.330

13:16.546 --> 13:18.548
check the red van.

13:21.134 --> 13:23.928
Can't see inside.

13:21.134 --> 13:23.928
The windows are all steamed up.

13:23.970 --> 13:25.597
They better be

13:23.970 --> 13:25.597
making soup in there.

13:26.889 --> 13:28.891
Alright, you two,

13:26.889 --> 13:28.891
the party's over.

13:28.933 --> 13:30.226
Come on out.

13:32.771 --> 13:34.897
Sorry, wrong van.

13:34.939 --> 13:36.941
Do your parents know

13:34.939 --> 13:36.941
what you're up to?

There's the phantom

13:41.028 --> 13:43.657
of the prom.

13:43.698 --> 13:46.660
Ew! He just put

13:43.698 --> 13:46.660
that piranha in the punch bowl.

13:47.702 --> 13:50.037
D.J., this movie's lame.

13:50.079 --> 13:51.247
Why don't we hop in the back

13:51.289 --> 13:53.249
and get a little

13:51.289 --> 13:53.249
more comfortable?

13:53.291 --> 13:55.834
I'm pretty

13:53.291 --> 13:55.834
comfortable, right here.

13:55.876 --> 13:59.589
Oh, that's right, I forgot.

13:55.876 --> 13:59.589
You're a freshman.

13:59.631 --> 14:02.967
This must be like your-your

13:59.631 --> 14:02.967
first time at a drive-in, right?

14:03.009 --> 14:05.637
No, I come here all the time.

14:05.679 --> 14:08.973
I was just here Sunday

14:05.679 --> 14:08.973
for the swap meet.

14:09.015 --> 14:10.308
Come on, let's get in the back.

14:10.350 --> 14:12.352
Listen to a little music

to just get up and dance.

14:35.875 --> 14:38.919
Whoa, D.J., just relax.

14:56.312 --> 14:59.023
watch the movie.

14:59.065 --> 15:00.316
How come?

15:00.358 --> 15:02.276
Well, I just don't

15:00.358 --> 15:02.276
feel right about this.

15:05.363 --> 15:07.657
Alright. That's cool.

15:07.699 --> 15:09.576
I'll go get us

[screaming]

15:23.882 --> 15:26.050
What are you guys doing here?

15:26.092 --> 15:28.469
We were worried about you.

15:28.511 --> 15:30.513
- Where's Pete?

15:28.511 --> 15:30.513
- He's getting popcorn.

15:30.555 --> 15:33.099
Would you guys please leave?

15:30.555 --> 15:33.099
I'm on a date, okay?

15:33.140 --> 15:35.101
Oh, you didn't tell us you

15:33.140 --> 15:35.101
were going to the drive-in.

15:35.142 --> 15:36.686
In Tony the Tiger's van.

15:38.396 --> 15:40.481
Look, can we please

15:38.396 --> 15:40.481
talk about this later?

15:40.523 --> 15:42.024
I don't want Pete

15:40.523 --> 15:42.024
to see you here.

15:42.066 --> 15:43.984
Do you know

15:42.066 --> 15:43.984
how embarrassing this is?

15:44.026 --> 15:45.361
Put yourself in my shoes.

15:45.403 --> 15:47.572
I'd love to.

15:45.403 --> 15:47.572
You got a left and a right?

I-I promise I'll

15:52.911 --> 15:54.704
tell him to take me home.

15:54.746 --> 15:56.038
Just don't let him see you here.

16:03.504 --> 16:05.089
(D.J.)

16:03.504 --> 16:05.089
'Hi, Pete. You're back.'

16:05.131 --> 16:08.509
Yeah, let's go ahead

16:05.131 --> 16:08.509
and get in front, alright?

16:08.551 --> 16:10.303
Uh, wait.

16:10.344 --> 16:11.888
Just a minute.

16:11.930 --> 16:13.598
We should straighten up first.

16:13.640 --> 16:15.558
I come from a very neat family.

16:16.392 --> 16:17.894
[sneezes]

16:20.814 --> 16:22.231
(together)

16:20.814 --> 16:22.231
Hello.

16:23.650 --> 16:25.151
Hello.

16:25.192 --> 16:27.069
I, uh, I guess you're wondering

16:27.111 --> 16:29.196
what we're doing

16:27.111 --> 16:29.196
here in your van.

16:29.238 --> 16:31.741
In our tuxedos, yet.

16:31.783 --> 16:33.743
Tell him, Joey.

16:33.785 --> 16:36.287
Well, it's uh..

16:33.785 --> 16:36.287
Well, Pete, it..

16:36.329 --> 16:37.997
- Heck, it's a very funny story.

16:36.329 --> 16:37.997
- 'Yeah.'

16:38.038 --> 16:41.668
And, uh, no one, uh, really

16:38.038 --> 16:41.668
tells it funnier than Jess.

16:41.709 --> 16:42.961
Jess, tell him.

16:44.044 --> 16:45.880
Yeah, it-it is a funny story.

16:45.922 --> 16:47.465
Actually, why, you know what,

16:45.922 --> 16:47.465
it's not even a story.

16:47.507 --> 16:49.425
It's a, you know that

16:47.507 --> 16:49.425
demo tape we were makin'?

16:49.467 --> 16:50.635
I just was wonderin', do you

16:50.677 --> 16:52.011
you want the whole

16:50.677 --> 16:52.011
song on that tape?

16:52.052 --> 16:53.429
You wanted

16:52.052 --> 16:53.429
the whole song, right?

16:54.472 --> 16:56.098
Yeah.

16:56.140 --> 16:58.852
Okay, good, because I-I was

16:56.140 --> 16:58.852
put the beginning, middle..

16:58.893 --> 17:00.854
It's all on the..

16:58.893 --> 17:00.854
We can leave now.

17:00.895 --> 17:03.063
Yeah, we were done.

17:03.105 --> 17:06.442
Uh...D.J., why don't we just

17:06.484 --> 17:08.402
go ahead and call it a night?

17:08.444 --> 17:10.530
Actually, you can go ahead

17:08.444 --> 17:10.530
and go home with your dad.

17:12.406 --> 17:13.825
Okay.

17:13.867 --> 17:15.952
[instrumental music]

17:21.123 --> 17:22.416
Keep up the good work.

17:23.376 --> 17:25.085
Okay, let's get you two to bed

17:25.127 --> 17:26.420
so I can hit the phone.

17:28.297 --> 17:30.508
Ew!

17:30.550 --> 17:34.428
Steph, would you mind, uh,

17:30.550 --> 17:34.428
disposin' of the toxic waste?

17:34.470 --> 17:37.724
- Once again, it will cost you.

17:34.470 --> 17:37.724
- Alright, alright.

17:37.765 --> 17:40.434
But do something quick before

17:37.765 --> 17:40.434
the smoke alarm goes off.

17:40.476 --> 17:44.104
Come here, little guy.

17:44.146 --> 17:45.565
Oh, boy.

17:46.816 --> 17:48.818
Ew! You too?

17:50.152 --> 17:51.696
You're getting a kick

17:50.152 --> 17:51.696
out of this, aren't you?

17:58.452 --> 18:00.830
Good boy.

17:58.452 --> 18:00.830
You look very pretty.

18:03.917 --> 18:07.003
Okay, you could

18:03.917 --> 18:07.003
have another treat.

18:07.045 --> 18:08.170
Sit.

18:11.049 --> 18:15.553
You sure like

18:11.049 --> 18:15.553
these Doggie Doodles.

18:15.595 --> 18:17.263
They look like a cookie.

18:20.683 --> 18:22.769
And they smell like a pork chop.

18:25.021 --> 18:27.023
I wonder what they taste like.

18:28.608 --> 18:29.943
Ew!

18:34.030 --> 18:35.865
Yuck!

18:35.907 --> 18:38.034
I should have known.

18:38.076 --> 18:40.036
You drink from the toilet.

18:45.458 --> 18:48.795
- Is it over?

18:45.458 --> 18:48.795
- Yeah, you can breathe now.

18:48.836 --> 18:52.256
Hi, girls.

18:48.836 --> 18:52.256
How are my adorable babies?

18:52.298 --> 18:55.593
Yeah, adorable if you don't

18:52.298 --> 18:55.593
have a sense of smell.

18:55.635 --> 18:57.720
I'm surprised your

18:55.635 --> 18:57.720
wallpaper isn't peeling.

18:59.138 --> 19:02.100
Could you please

18:59.138 --> 19:02.100
pay me so I can go home?

19:02.141 --> 19:05.603
Okay, Kimmy, I owe

19:02.141 --> 19:05.603
you $10, let me get my purse.

19:06.479 --> 19:08.481
And, Kimmy, you owe me..

19:08.522 --> 19:09.607
Let's see.

19:10.733 --> 19:13.319
Two feeds, two burps,

19:10.733 --> 19:13.319
two number two's

19:13.360 --> 19:14.570
and a number one

19:14.612 --> 19:16.656
That comes to..

19:16.697 --> 19:17.782
...$10.

19:19.033 --> 19:20.701
What a rip off.

19:20.743 --> 19:23.454
Can we make Kimmy

19:20.743 --> 19:23.454
our regular baby sitter?

19:25.623 --> 19:26.916
Deej, we need to talk.

19:26.958 --> 19:28.876
You can't keep givin' us

19:26.958 --> 19:28.876
the silent treatment.

19:28.918 --> 19:32.254
Okay, fine, let's talk.

19:28.918 --> 19:32.254
I'm totally humiliated.

19:32.296 --> 19:35.133
When this gets around school,

19:32.296 --> 19:35.133
I'll never be asked out again.

19:35.174 --> 19:36.717
But that's what

19:35.174 --> 19:36.717
you wanted, isn't it?

19:38.469 --> 19:40.888
I think we were doing better

19:38.469 --> 19:40.888
with the silent treatment.

19:41.555 --> 19:42.723
Guys, wait.

19:48.729 --> 19:50.314
[sighs]

19:50.356 --> 19:51.607
Alright, let's go.

19:54.152 --> 19:55.528
(Danny)

19:54.152 --> 19:55.528
'D.J.?'

19:57.697 --> 19:59.615
You know we have

19:57.697 --> 19:59.615
to talk about this.

19:59.657 --> 20:02.493
Fine, you said I was

19:59.657 --> 20:02.493
old enough to date.

20:02.535 --> 20:04.078
You said you trust me.

20:04.120 --> 20:06.580
You said you had

20:04.120 --> 20:06.580
confidence in my judgment.

20:06.622 --> 20:08.290
But you really

20:06.622 --> 20:08.290
didn't mean it, did you?

20:08.332 --> 20:11.127
The-the first time I go out

20:08.332 --> 20:11.127
with a guy that you don't like

20:11.169 --> 20:13.629
you come charging in

20:11.169 --> 20:13.629
like the date police.

20:13.671 --> 20:15.673
(D.J.)

20:13.671 --> 20:15.673
'You completely overreacted.'

20:16.799 --> 20:18.676
All three of you

20:16.799 --> 20:18.676
owe me an apology.

20:21.220 --> 20:22.555
I think she's right, guys.

20:23.639 --> 20:25.141
We did get a little crazy,

20:23.639 --> 20:25.141
didn't we?

20:26.392 --> 20:27.685
I'm going to my room.

20:30.021 --> 20:31.313
I'm sorry, Deej.

20:31.355 --> 20:33.524
- Yeah, so am I.

20:31.355 --> 20:33.524
- Me too.

20:35.442 --> 20:38.320
It's alright.

20:35.442 --> 20:38.320
Let's just forget about it.

20:38.362 --> 20:40.740
- Everybody makes mistakes.

20:38.362 --> 20:40.740
- 'Yeah.'

20:40.781 --> 20:42.200
I just hope next time

20:40.781 --> 20:42.200
you'll think things

20:42.241 --> 20:43.492
through a little better.

20:43.534 --> 20:45.661
- Yeah.

20:43.534 --> 20:45.661
- Sorry.

20:45.703 --> 20:46.787
I dunno what I wasn't thinkin'.

20:46.829 --> 20:48.998
I wasn't thinking

20:46.829 --> 20:48.998
either, really.

20:49.040 --> 20:50.541
That was real wrong.

20:49.040 --> 20:50.541
I'm sorry.

20:54.670 --> 20:55.755
You know, Deej,

20:54.670 --> 20:55.755
one more thing.

20:55.796 --> 20:57.381
Wait a minute.

20:57.423 --> 20:58.758
I knew that was too easy.

21:00.134 --> 21:01.260
Sweetheart..

21:03.721 --> 21:06.140
Why did you lie to us about

21:03.721 --> 21:06.140
where you were going tonight?

21:06.182 --> 21:09.018
I didn't lie.

21:06.182 --> 21:09.018
I said I was going to a movie.

21:09.060 --> 21:11.104
Yeah, but you

21:09.060 --> 21:11.104
conveniently forgot to tell us

21:11.145 --> 21:12.438
it was a drive-in movie.

21:12.479 --> 21:14.774
With a guy who's never

21:12.479 --> 21:14.774
heard the word no.

21:15.942 --> 21:18.027
- Did I forget to mention that?

21:15.942 --> 21:18.027
- Yeah.

21:19.361 --> 21:22.489
Look, D.J.,

21:19.361 --> 21:22.489
you're 15 years old.

21:22.531 --> 21:25.492
And you still live

21:22.531 --> 21:25.492
by the rules of this house.

21:25.534 --> 21:27.120
And if you're gonna go on a date

21:27.161 --> 21:30.206
you have to tell us

21:27.161 --> 21:30.206
exactly where you're goin'.

21:30.248 --> 21:32.708
I just didn't

21:30.248 --> 21:32.708
want you guys to freak out.

21:32.750 --> 21:34.252
What makes you think

21:32.750 --> 21:34.252
we would've freaked out?

21:34.293 --> 21:36.503
I mean, just 'cause

21:34.293 --> 21:36.503
we ran around the drive-in

21:36.545 --> 21:38.547
in our tuxedos, what?

21:39.799 --> 21:41.717
Well, I guess it's

21:39.799 --> 21:41.717
my turn to say I'm sorry.

21:43.010 --> 21:44.470
I'm sorry.

21:44.511 --> 21:45.972
Hey, Deej, you going

21:44.511 --> 21:45.972
out with guys

21:46.013 --> 21:47.598
is a whole new experience

21:46.013 --> 21:47.598
for us, you know?

21:47.640 --> 21:49.725
I mean, we just have

21:47.640 --> 21:49.725
to trust each other.

21:49.767 --> 21:52.228
We just want

21:49.767 --> 21:52.228
what's best for you.

21:52.270 --> 21:53.437
Thanks, guys.

21:54.230 --> 21:55.273
Do me a favor.

21:55.355 --> 21:58.609
No more commando

21:55.355 --> 21:58.609
raids on my dates.

21:58.651 --> 22:01.154
Alright and no more

21:58.651 --> 22:01.154
drive-ins for a while, okay?

22:01.195 --> 22:02.488
Deal.

22:05.365 --> 22:06.826
Deej, are you okay?

22:06.867 --> 22:07.952
Yeah, everything's fine.

22:09.453 --> 22:11.038
Becky.

22:11.080 --> 22:13.332
Oh, man, we won.

22:13.373 --> 22:15.501
Finally, somebody

22:13.373 --> 22:15.501
has recognized our talents.

22:15.542 --> 22:18.378
Vindicated after

22:15.542 --> 22:18.378
four long years!

22:18.420 --> 22:20.840
Well, actually,

22:18.420 --> 22:20.840
they recognized Joey's talents.

22:20.881 --> 22:23.801
He won for

22:20.881 --> 22:23.801
"Best Children's Programming."

22:23.843 --> 22:26.428
Oh, I don't believe it.

22:23.843 --> 22:26.428
This is great.

22:26.470 --> 22:30.599
Oh, vindicated

22:26.470 --> 22:30.599
after four long months.

22:32.226 --> 22:34.937
- Well, congratulations, Joey.

22:32.226 --> 22:34.937
- Thanks.

22:34.979 --> 22:36.605
Could I-could I just hold it

22:34.979 --> 22:36.605
for a second?

22:36.647 --> 22:38.316
- Sure.

22:36.647 --> 22:38.316
- Thanks.

22:40.651 --> 22:41.986
He's an immature baby.
