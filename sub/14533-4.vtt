WEBVTT

00:12.291 --> 00:14.208
NEAL GAMBY: We all did stuff
last night that I'm sure

00:14.208 --> 00:15.000
we'll regret forever.

00:15.000 --> 00:15.875
What did you do?

00:15.875 --> 00:17.708
(SNORING)

00:19.083 --> 00:21.375
I'm looking at the section on
her menstrual cycle.

00:22.333 --> 00:23.917
That's my personal business
for work.

00:24.667 --> 00:25.750
Shh-Shh-Shh.

00:26.291 --> 00:28.583
We're a paperless school now,
Mrs. Libby.

00:28.583 --> 00:30.333
I prefer you just to fire her.

00:30.333 --> 00:31.208
Fire her?

00:31.834 --> 00:33.917
(CRYING)
Oh, I hurt.

00:34.083 --> 00:37.125
This woman will fire you and me.
Time to dig up some dirt.

00:40.041 --> 00:42.083
(SCREAMING)
My house is on fire!

00:42.083 --> 00:44.166
Did she say her house
was on fire?

00:44.166 --> 00:45.000
Did who say?

00:51.959 --> 00:53.959
Let me see.
Come on, man.

00:53.959 --> 00:55.959
Mario! Luke!
Y'all stop it
and get to work.

00:55.959 --> 00:58.333
I ain't trying to be
out here all day.

00:58.333 --> 00:59.417
Oh shit.

00:59.417 --> 01:01.625
Ma, how come
your panties ain't burnt up?

01:01.625 --> 01:04.166
Momma got them
flame-retarded drawers.

01:04.166 --> 01:06.250
All right now!
Y'all know my nerves is bad.

01:06.250 --> 01:08.291
I'm not in the mood for that.
Now y'all come on now.

01:08.291 --> 01:10.875
(laughing)
Okay, like-- Hey!

01:10.875 --> 01:12.959
Jeez.
You've been living here
how long?

01:12.959 --> 01:15.166
I've been here
for about two weeks.

01:15.166 --> 01:17.708
Can you shed some light on
what might have happened?

01:17.708 --> 01:20.583
I'm sorry to say,
but my gut is telling me
it's arson, Dr. Brown.

01:20.583 --> 01:22.959
Arson?
You know anybody

01:22.959 --> 01:24.500
that might want
to burn down your house?

01:24.500 --> 01:26.250
No, not at all.
We just moved here.

01:26.250 --> 01:28.083
That's your job.
You tell me.

01:28.083 --> 01:29.375
It could be anybody.

01:29.375 --> 01:32.542
Hobo, drunkards,
gutter punks, secret enemy.

01:32.542 --> 01:35.250
Maybe even a family member
who begrudges you.

01:35.250 --> 01:36.834
(clanging)
(Luke laughs)

01:37.959 --> 01:40.166
Are those your kids?

01:40.166 --> 01:41.500
(clanging)

01:41.500 --> 01:43.583
(laughter continues)

01:43.583 --> 01:46.166
Mario:
♪ Up in flames,
up in flames ♪

01:46.166 --> 01:48.583
Luke:
♪ All burnt up,
all burnt up ♪

01:48.583 --> 01:51.000
♪ Hotel, motel,
Hampton Inn ♪

01:51.000 --> 01:53.583
♪ Trying to make it back
to my Philly friends ♪

01:53.583 --> 01:55.959
Ohh!
Would y'all quit
all that racket in there?

01:55.959 --> 01:57.375
Don't you have
homework to do?

01:57.375 --> 01:59.250
Man, see, this is why I say
we should've never left Philly.

01:59.250 --> 02:00.375
This place is bumfuck.

02:00.375 --> 02:02.542
Now, that's enough
of this talk, okay?

02:02.542 --> 02:04.125
This is our home now.
Deal with it.

02:04.125 --> 02:06.583
People here are
corny as fuck.
Well, you corny.

02:06.583 --> 02:08.041
(laughs)
Look at you.

02:08.041 --> 02:09.291
(shattering)
I'm Candyman!

02:09.291 --> 02:12.041
Uh-uh! Hey!
Stop it with them matches!

02:12.041 --> 02:14.208
Mario, what the hell
is wrong with you?

02:14.208 --> 02:16.667
Damn it! Break it up!
You're a bitch!

02:16.667 --> 02:18.083
Break it up, I said!

02:18.083 --> 02:19.417
Enough!

02:19.417 --> 02:21.041
Enough!

02:21.041 --> 02:23.917
(theme music playing)

02:33.542 --> 02:34.875
(tires screech)

02:35.875 --> 02:37.375
Hurry!

02:40.083 --> 02:42.083
Boy:
Go! Move it!

02:42.083 --> 02:45.333
♪ ♪

02:52.417 --> 02:55.375
What are y'all gawking at?
Get to class. Get in there.

02:55.375 --> 02:57.667
It's not funny.
Get inside.
What is--

02:57.667 --> 02:59.583
So this is some kind
of tradition?

02:59.583 --> 03:01.166
It happens every year
to kick of Spirit Week.

03:01.166 --> 03:04.667
Pranks between North Jackson
and Percival are legendary.

03:04.667 --> 03:05.959
A whole week of this?

03:05.959 --> 03:07.333
Leading up to homecoming.

03:07.333 --> 03:09.417
Then they kick our ass
in the game every year.

03:09.417 --> 03:11.417
Y'all keep moving.
Keep moving. Stop looking.

03:11.417 --> 03:12.834
Well, not every year.

03:12.834 --> 03:15.250
We beat 'em once,
nine years ago.

03:15.250 --> 03:17.834
All this means is
we just gotta come back
at them even harder.

03:17.834 --> 03:20.625
Oh, I'm afraid not.
We are not participating
in this behavior.

03:20.625 --> 03:23.208
Well, it's tradition,
so you better--
I'm sorry

03:23.208 --> 03:24.959
if I do not share
your enthusiasm

03:24.959 --> 03:27.375
with damaging property,
Mr. Gamby.

03:27.375 --> 03:29.291
My house burned down.

03:29.291 --> 03:32.291
This, right here, is exactly
why sports get on my nerves.

03:32.291 --> 03:34.333
Us and them,
winners, losers,

03:34.333 --> 03:36.458
it divides us
in a very unhealthy way.

03:36.458 --> 03:38.583
Yes, it does.
Sports unhealthy?

03:38.583 --> 03:41.417
Well, you might want to take
that up with the cereal Wheaties

03:41.417 --> 03:42.708
'cause I think
they would disagree.

03:42.708 --> 03:47.333
(mutters) Sounds stupid
saying sports are unhealthy.

03:47.333 --> 03:49.583
Folks don't want to be seeing
doo-doo on the lawn.

03:49.583 --> 03:51.625
Clean it up.

03:52.542 --> 03:54.458
Are you talk--
Clean it up!

03:54.458 --> 03:55.625
Okay.

03:58.583 --> 04:00.625
Janice Swift. New fish.

04:00.625 --> 04:02.500
The woman you are replacing
worked here for 30 years.

04:02.500 --> 04:04.375
Many people loved her,
including myself.

04:04.375 --> 04:06.333
You have very big shoes
to fill. Are you ready?

04:06.333 --> 04:07.750
Sure. I think so.

04:07.750 --> 04:09.583
Don't be braggadocios.
It's not attractive.

04:09.583 --> 04:11.792
Grab that ISS folder
and follow me.

04:11.792 --> 04:13.000
We're on the move!

04:13.000 --> 04:15.000
Each of you will be required
to wear a safety vest

04:15.000 --> 04:16.208
while you dispose
of the manure.

04:16.208 --> 04:18.542
Ms. Swift, I expect you
to be able to identify

04:18.542 --> 04:19.875
these problem students visually.

04:19.875 --> 04:23.166
Watch. Jared Ribner, caught
cheating on a math test.

04:23.166 --> 04:24.333
Four days ISS.

04:24.333 --> 04:26.667
Timothy Blanchard, called
his teacher a dickhead.

04:26.667 --> 04:28.250
Seven days ISS.

04:28.250 --> 04:31.166
And finally,
our main attraction,
Mr. Barry Weiss.

04:31.166 --> 04:34.333
I confiscated a vial
of liquid LSD from his locker.

04:34.333 --> 04:35.750
Where'd you get
the acid, Barry?

04:35.750 --> 04:36.875
Where's the trips?

04:36.875 --> 04:38.875
Not mine,
and you can't prove it was.

04:38.875 --> 04:42.166
Have fun cleaning up
Percival's horse shit,
you asshole.

04:42.166 --> 04:43.834
Flag him and let's move.

04:43.834 --> 04:45.500
Every morning, I come
down here for breakfast.

04:45.500 --> 04:47.083
I love to get
a little something to eat.

04:47.083 --> 04:49.333
They know what I like.
What do I like to eat
for breakfast, you guys?

04:49.333 --> 04:51.667
Come on, this ain't
a trick question.
You guys know what I like.

04:51.667 --> 04:53.542
Dayshawn, what do I like
to eat for breakfast?

04:53.542 --> 04:56.083
Chocolate chip pancakes
with whipped cream, extra syrup.

04:56.083 --> 04:58.250
What? No, I don't like that.

04:58.250 --> 05:00.333
Quinoa.
Quinoa?

05:00.333 --> 05:03.250
I know you're all about
that game this weekend though.

05:03.250 --> 05:05.041
I most certainly am.
That's what I'm talkin' about.

05:05.041 --> 05:07.917
And I'll tell you what,
I think we got a good chance
of winning this year.

05:07.917 --> 05:09.542
(laughs)

05:09.542 --> 05:11.708
We are gonna get our ass--
You are dead serious.

05:11.708 --> 05:13.542
For real?
Yes, for real.

05:13.542 --> 05:15.291
I mean, maybe.
I hope so.

05:15.291 --> 05:17.333
They do make us look like
we suck like shit though.

05:17.333 --> 05:19.041
I'm telling you.
Dayshawn, do not talk

05:19.041 --> 05:20.708
about sucking shit
in front of Ms. Swift.

05:20.708 --> 05:23.041
That is not appropriate.
I'm sorry, Ms. Swift.

05:23.041 --> 05:24.834
My name is Dayshawn.

05:24.834 --> 05:27.166
I like your glasses.
(giggles)

05:27.166 --> 05:29.291
Do you have boyfriend?

05:29.291 --> 05:30.875
Do you?

05:31.708 --> 05:33.375
Hmph. Didn't think so.

05:33.375 --> 05:34.750
Let's move.

05:34.750 --> 05:35.917
You want this corn dog?

05:35.917 --> 05:37.083
No, it's okay.

05:37.083 --> 05:38.875
I'm gonna give you
my corn dog.

05:40.041 --> 05:41.750
Gamby:
Whoo! Hot milk!

05:41.750 --> 05:44.917
Looks like somebody caught
a mean case of school spirit.

05:44.917 --> 05:46.041
Hey, Mr. Gamby.

05:46.041 --> 05:47.291
What was that?
Nothin'.

05:47.291 --> 05:49.417
Just a, uh, off-the-cuff remark
about your school pride.

05:49.417 --> 05:50.917
I'm not gonna repeat it
word-for-word.

05:50.917 --> 05:52.333
It just wouldn't be as fresh.

05:52.333 --> 05:53.875
Okay. That's fine.

05:53.875 --> 05:55.625
I mean, the gist of it
was that, uh...

05:55.625 --> 05:58.083
it looks like you're really
looking forward to homecoming.

05:58.083 --> 06:00.208
Oh. Honestly, not at all.

06:00.208 --> 06:02.000
I got assigned
to be faculty advisor

06:02.000 --> 06:04.417
for the homecoming committee,
but, um, I don't know.

06:04.417 --> 06:06.542
This whole thing just makes
me feel very uncomfortable.

06:06.542 --> 06:08.250
Now I know
you're fuckin' with me.

06:08.250 --> 06:09.417
Look at these signs.

06:09.417 --> 06:11.208
Looks like you've been
working on these all night.

06:11.208 --> 06:12.208
I just found that
in the shed.

06:12.208 --> 06:14.250
Well, you breathed
new life into it.

06:14.250 --> 06:16.000
Keep up the enthusiasm,
Ms. Snodgrass.

06:16.000 --> 06:17.625
We're sure gonna need it.

06:17.625 --> 06:19.667
I wish I had a million,
ten thousands of you.

06:19.667 --> 06:20.750
Thanks.
Thank you.

06:20.750 --> 06:22.041
Get back to work.
(snaps fingers)

06:22.041 --> 06:24.125
Good work, Taylor!
I love these signs!

06:24.125 --> 06:25.417
Snodgrass!
Yeah?

06:25.417 --> 06:27.458
On your knees!

06:27.458 --> 06:30.792
(mutters) To paint the sign,
not to do dick sucks.

06:30.792 --> 06:33.041
Oh, fuck. Shit.

06:33.041 --> 06:34.875
Shit, shit, shit.

06:34.875 --> 06:38.041
(moans)

06:38.041 --> 06:39.375
(panting)

06:39.375 --> 06:42.083
Someone's been
eating strawberries.

06:42.083 --> 06:43.375
No, no, no.

06:43.375 --> 06:44.750
Look, look, we--
we should talk.

06:44.750 --> 06:45.917
We should talk. Uh...

06:45.917 --> 06:48.041
what happened
in Charles Towne Landing,

06:48.041 --> 06:49.500
it was a one-time thing.

06:49.500 --> 06:50.458
What?

06:50.458 --> 06:52.208
I literally just got finished
blowing you.

06:52.208 --> 06:53.750
You haven't told
anyone, have you?

06:53.750 --> 06:56.458
Are you serious right now?
Are you playing with me?

06:56.458 --> 06:59.125
Bosses and employees
cannot fuck each other.

06:59.125 --> 07:01.166
That's not what you said
at Charles Towne Landing.

07:01.166 --> 07:03.667
Your recollection of events
is all over the place, okay?

07:03.667 --> 07:06.208
You wouldn't want to be fired
for being a liar.

07:06.208 --> 07:09.083
It's not a lie.
You fucked the shit out of me.

07:09.083 --> 07:10.542
Well, then for being a whore.

07:10.542 --> 07:12.083
Excuse me?
I'm just sayin'.

07:12.083 --> 07:13.500
That's how
it's gonna look to people.

07:13.500 --> 07:14.792
Who's gonna gossip?

07:14.792 --> 07:17.208
Whoever finds out about--
I'll fucking kill 'em

07:17.208 --> 07:19.333
if they gossip.
(giggles)
No. See? See?

07:19.333 --> 07:20.417
There you go.

07:20.417 --> 07:22.000
Just please don't tell
anyone, okay?

07:22.000 --> 07:23.708
If anybody gossips
about my baby,

07:23.708 --> 07:24.959
I'll fucking kill 'em.
No. Uh-uh.

07:24.959 --> 07:26.583
Uh-uh. No, look, look.
Look, look.

07:26.583 --> 07:27.708
We'll-- we'll talk later.

07:27.708 --> 07:29.458
I love you.
What?

07:29.458 --> 07:31.917
No, no, no. No. No.
Not really. I just--

07:31.917 --> 07:34.500
I'm not one of those guys
who's afraid to say that.

07:34.500 --> 07:38.041
Just wait here five minutes
and leave after I leave, okay?

07:38.041 --> 07:39.708
Okay. (giggles)

07:41.166 --> 07:42.875
(door opens, closes)

07:42.875 --> 07:44.500
(whispers)
I love you too.

07:44.500 --> 07:47.166
Coach:
All right, boys!
Defense above the line!

07:48.667 --> 07:49.875
(whistle trills)

07:49.875 --> 07:51.625
God damn.
Come on, Coach!

07:51.625 --> 07:52.959
Get these boys movin'!

07:52.959 --> 07:55.375
We're gonna get our ass kicked
for homecoming! Again!

07:55.375 --> 07:57.417
Pay attention to the game!

07:57.417 --> 07:59.417
They suck.

07:59.417 --> 08:01.000
(sighs)

08:02.542 --> 08:04.166
Did you see
Brown this mornin'?

08:04.166 --> 08:06.750
Jesus! Put a fork in her.
She's done.

08:06.750 --> 08:09.917
(chuckles)
I installed spyware
on Cuntress' laptop.

08:09.917 --> 08:11.875
She's been hittin'
those LinkedIn job searches

08:11.875 --> 08:13.250
like she eats cheesecake.

08:13.250 --> 08:16.000
Huh.
I'll tell you what, Gamby,
we've got this bitch

08:16.000 --> 08:17.750
exactly where we want her.

08:17.750 --> 08:20.583
One push and she falls
into the Grand Canyon.

08:20.583 --> 08:22.375
(chuckles)
If she can fit.

08:22.375 --> 08:23.625
(laughing)

08:23.625 --> 08:26.083
If she can fit!
If she can fit!
'Cause she's so big

08:26.083 --> 08:28.166
that there's no way
she could probably fit.
I got it.

08:28.166 --> 08:29.250
Yeah.

08:30.583 --> 08:32.125
Gamby:
Wait, is that
a permanent marker?

08:32.125 --> 08:33.417
No, no,

08:33.417 --> 08:35.417
Russell, you're defacing
the athletic school property.

08:35.417 --> 08:38.041
I don't give
a fuck about athletics.
Don't you see, Gamby?

08:38.041 --> 08:40.250
This is
the perfect smokescreen.

08:40.250 --> 08:43.583
We can do anything
we want to Brown
and blame it on Percival.

08:49.291 --> 08:51.708
No. I do not like that.

08:53.417 --> 08:54.834
(marker squeaks)

08:54.834 --> 08:56.625
Russell:
Oh.

08:56.625 --> 08:57.667
Now that,

08:57.667 --> 08:59.250
I can get behind.

08:59.250 --> 09:01.125
That's the spirit, Gamby.

09:02.750 --> 09:05.625
Get your asses off the bed
in those wet bathing suits.

09:05.625 --> 09:06.792
Mario:
They dry now.

09:06.792 --> 09:08.500
Oh, I'm about to dry you.

09:08.500 --> 09:10.041
I just spoke
with your headmaster.

09:10.041 --> 09:11.667
He said y'all been
cutting class.

09:11.667 --> 09:13.458
Dude suck.
He's a old gay dude.

09:13.458 --> 09:16.125
Yeah, he tried
to touch my nipple.
Enough of this!

09:16.125 --> 09:18.458
Now, how did you boys get
to be so disrespectful?

09:18.458 --> 09:21.291
We've been going through a lot.
Our house burned down, Momma.

09:21.291 --> 09:22.458
Oh, I know it did.

09:22.458 --> 09:24.291
And they think
somebody did that on purpose,

09:24.291 --> 09:25.500
and I'm startin' to wonder

09:25.500 --> 09:27.792
who would want
to burn down our house?

09:27.792 --> 09:29.458
What you sayin', Momma?

09:29.458 --> 09:31.542
Now, I need y'all
to tell me the truth.

09:31.542 --> 09:32.959
Did you all
burn down that house

09:32.959 --> 09:34.291
so we'd have to move
back to Philly?

09:34.291 --> 09:37.041
The fuck?
Why would be burn
our own shit, Momma?

09:37.041 --> 09:39.875
Oh please! I know
how you all used to
like to mess with fire.

09:39.875 --> 09:41.583
Remember that Volkswagen?

09:41.583 --> 09:43.917
That wasn't fire.
Those were bottle bombs.
Bottle bombs.

09:43.917 --> 09:45.959
I don't care
what it was!

09:45.959 --> 09:47.458
Now answer me this.

09:47.458 --> 09:50.583
Did you all skip class on
the day the house burned down?

09:50.583 --> 09:52.000
Wait, what day was that?

09:52.000 --> 09:53.333
Tuesday.

09:53.333 --> 09:55.500
Oh. Yeah, we might've skipped.

09:55.500 --> 09:57.792
Oh, you think this funny,
huh, little boy?

09:57.792 --> 09:59.291
We didn't burn nothin'!
Damn, Momma!

09:59.291 --> 10:00.583
Stop bein' a asshole.

10:00.583 --> 10:03.000
Don't you dare
call me no asshole.

10:04.166 --> 10:05.583
You both are grounded!

10:05.583 --> 10:08.000
To the hotel?
You goddamn right,
to the hotel.

10:08.000 --> 10:09.500
You gonna sit here
and think about

10:09.500 --> 10:11.208
your mother being
an asshole.

10:11.208 --> 10:14.083
Now get into bed. Now!
But it's only 5:30!

10:14.083 --> 10:15.583
I don't care
what time it is!

10:15.583 --> 10:17.291
Get your ass into bed!

10:17.291 --> 10:19.166
Now!

10:19.166 --> 10:21.000
Smack your lips again. Hear?

10:27.708 --> 10:29.500
Looks like your intel
was fucked up.

10:29.500 --> 10:31.208
They were supposed to be
here 15 minutes ago.

10:31.208 --> 10:32.667
They'll be here.

10:32.667 --> 10:35.000
Hey, I know that
we're doing this
to make Belinda look bad,

10:35.000 --> 10:37.875
but wouldn't it be awesome
if we did some shit
to Percival too?

10:37.875 --> 10:39.583
You know, something
that just got in their heads,

10:39.583 --> 10:41.291
messed with them,
made them blow this game?

10:41.291 --> 10:43.458
Who gives a fuck
about this game?

10:43.458 --> 10:44.917
No, no, I know, I know.

10:44.917 --> 10:46.417
I'm just saying
wouldn't it be awesome

10:46.417 --> 10:48.542
if we took, like, a shit
in that big fountain of theirs?

10:48.542 --> 10:52.542
You think that's funny?
Taking a shit in a fountain?

10:52.542 --> 10:54.417
Well, it could be effective.
You know, if you came there

10:54.417 --> 10:56.208
and you saw that someone
had dookied on your stuff,

10:56.208 --> 10:58.625
it might fuck with your head.
Fucking gross me out
is what that would do.

10:58.625 --> 11:00.542
Excuse me
for brainstorming.
Be quiet. Look.

11:03.375 --> 11:04.917
Suit up.

11:08.583 --> 11:09.750
(tires screech)

11:09.750 --> 11:11.250
Boy:
Okay, let's do it!

11:11.250 --> 11:12.458
Let's go!

11:13.583 --> 11:15.041
Go, go!

11:15.041 --> 11:16.458
(muffled chatter)

11:26.041 --> 11:27.708
Who the fuck is Belinda?

11:27.708 --> 11:29.083
Don't worry about it.

11:29.083 --> 11:31.750
Keep doing more! More!

11:31.750 --> 11:34.583
(animals bleating)

11:49.583 --> 11:52.166
Russell:
Fuck you, Belinda Brown!

11:54.166 --> 11:57.125
Jesus Christ, Russell!
Those are our fucking trophies!

11:57.125 --> 11:58.750
I don't give a fuck!

11:58.750 --> 12:00.041
Finish it!

12:00.041 --> 12:01.625
(screams)

12:06.834 --> 12:08.750
(animals bleating)

12:10.125 --> 12:13.000
Whoever did this is vile.

12:13.000 --> 12:14.750
Y'all keep going.
Don't gawk!

12:14.750 --> 12:15.917
Yeah, I gotta agree.

12:15.917 --> 12:17.792
You know, this is the worst
I've ever seen it.

12:17.792 --> 12:19.000
Never seen it this bad.

12:19.000 --> 12:20.458
But why would
they single me out?

12:20.458 --> 12:22.291
Russell:
Well, maybe it's 'cause
you're a figurehead.

12:22.291 --> 12:23.959
Or maybe they see
a weakness. I don't know.

12:23.959 --> 12:25.834
I'll bet that's what it is.

12:25.834 --> 12:27.625
I bet that
they see a weakness.

12:27.625 --> 12:29.583
They think you're a weak person.

12:29.583 --> 12:31.959
Is that supposed to be
my vagina?
Hmm...

12:31.959 --> 12:34.166
I'm gonna say
that's a negative.

12:34.166 --> 12:36.792
It appears that they're
saying that you are...

12:36.792 --> 12:38.542
a, uh, a cunt.

12:38.542 --> 12:40.375
So, I think that's just
a drawing of a cunt,

12:40.375 --> 12:42.583
not necessarily your cunt.

12:42.583 --> 12:44.166
I don't think it's yours.
It's purple.

12:44.166 --> 12:47.041
Yeah, so I think you're good
on that not being your cunt.

12:47.041 --> 12:48.291
Mr. Gamby, get your keys.

12:48.291 --> 12:49.708
Why? Where are we going?

12:50.708 --> 12:52.291
We're going to Percival.

12:52.291 --> 12:55.542
♪ ♪

13:11.166 --> 13:12.917
Gamby.
I thought I smelled feet.

13:12.917 --> 13:14.166
What are you doing here?

13:14.166 --> 13:16.333
Vice Principal Hernandez.
Vice Principal Sweed.

13:16.333 --> 13:19.041
We're here to see Cavanaugh.
She's busy.

13:20.125 --> 13:22.083
Oh, I think she'll see me.

13:22.083 --> 13:23.708
And me.

13:23.708 --> 13:25.708
And me too.

13:28.000 --> 13:29.375
Ooh, oh, oh!
Oh, I'm sorry.

13:29.375 --> 13:31.083
I'm sorry.
It's fine. Come in.

13:32.041 --> 13:33.250
(beeping)

13:34.375 --> 13:37.208
Ms. Cavanaugh, I am
Dr. Belinda Brown from--

13:37.208 --> 13:38.834
I know who you are.

13:38.834 --> 13:40.708
So glad another woman has taken

13:40.708 --> 13:42.542
an executive position
in this district.

13:42.542 --> 13:45.166
So, what gives me
the pleasure, Dr. Brown?

13:45.166 --> 13:46.875
Well, truthfully,
I am here to speak

13:46.875 --> 13:48.834
with you
about Spirit Week.
Mm.

13:48.834 --> 13:50.375
Ah, I see.

13:50.375 --> 13:52.750
I have a scheduled engagement
in the gymnasium.

13:52.750 --> 13:55.250
Do you mind
if we do this
on the move?

13:55.250 --> 13:57.083
Belinda:
There has to be adults
in this situation.

13:57.083 --> 13:59.083
Can't we lead by example?

13:59.083 --> 14:01.166
I'm just worried
about the message
we're sending

14:01.166 --> 14:04.583
if we let our students get away
with vile pranks like these.

14:04.583 --> 14:06.250
It has gotten
rather extreme.

14:06.250 --> 14:07.291
We were hit
just this morning.

14:07.291 --> 14:09.375
Someone defecated
in our fountain.

14:09.375 --> 14:11.083
Belinda: Oh!
Gamby: Damn, sorry to hear that.

14:11.083 --> 14:13.041
Must be hittin'
everybody here pretty hard.

14:13.041 --> 14:15.417
It's a good prank.
It's uninspired and base.

14:15.417 --> 14:17.542
It's sad to think
what sort of child's mind

14:17.542 --> 14:18.917
would come up
with such a thing.
Mm.

14:18.917 --> 14:21.667
Probably a pretty smart one,
I'd imagine.
(scoffs)

14:21.667 --> 14:26.208
So Principal Cavanaugh,
shall we end this rivalry?

14:29.250 --> 14:31.750
(marching band plays)
(cheering and applause)

14:34.333 --> 14:35.542
Whoo!

14:35.542 --> 14:36.959
(cheering)

14:45.000 --> 14:46.417
I can't imagine

14:46.417 --> 14:49.041
how emotionally unstable
you must feel right now.

14:49.041 --> 14:51.542
Newly divorced,
moving to a new town,

14:51.542 --> 14:53.875
and your house burns
to the ground?

14:53.875 --> 14:55.625
And your only support
is these two?

14:55.625 --> 14:59.083
Everyone in the district knows
they wanted your job.

14:59.083 --> 15:00.500
I'm sure
they're very supportive.

15:00.500 --> 15:02.583
Ugh, I feel for you, Belinda,

15:02.583 --> 15:04.750
but I have a school
of my own to run

15:04.750 --> 15:06.959
and we have a game
to win this Friday.

15:06.959 --> 15:09.917
A game we always win.

15:09.917 --> 15:11.750
See you there.

15:18.083 --> 15:19.875
Who are we?

15:19.875 --> 15:22.417
Students:
(chanting)
Rams! Rams!

15:22.417 --> 15:24.458
Rams! Rams! Rams!

15:24.458 --> 15:26.333
Rams! Rams! Rams!

15:26.333 --> 15:28.500
Rams! Rams! Rams!

15:28.500 --> 15:29.667
Rams! Rams!

15:29.667 --> 15:31.083
Rams! Rams!

15:31.083 --> 15:32.125
Rams! Rams!

15:32.125 --> 15:33.583
Rams! Rams!

15:33.583 --> 15:37.375
(chanting continuing)

15:44.250 --> 15:45.417
Taylor Watt,

15:45.417 --> 15:47.500
what percentage done
are these decorations?

15:47.500 --> 15:49.542
Oh, I think
we're almost finished.

15:49.542 --> 15:52.417
You see, this is why
I have to supervise
these goddamn things.

15:52.417 --> 15:54.375
What's up, Neil?
Well, Taylor Watt
seems to think

15:54.375 --> 15:57.500
that you guys are
pretty much almost done
decorating for the pep rally.

15:57.500 --> 15:59.083
Yes, finally.

15:59.083 --> 16:01.875
What do you think?
(trumpets fanfare)

16:01.875 --> 16:04.583
No. Don't do trumpets.

16:04.583 --> 16:06.792
Look, this right here,
this is not enough.

16:06.792 --> 16:08.208
I've been to Percival.

16:08.208 --> 16:09.708
I've seen what
the Rams are doing,

16:09.708 --> 16:10.917
and they're fucking crushing us!

16:10.917 --> 16:12.458
I mean, this banner,

16:12.458 --> 16:13.834
what-- what is
it even saying?

16:13.834 --> 16:16.625
It doesn't even say "Go!"
It says "North Jackson High."

16:16.625 --> 16:19.291
What-- what do you think,
we forgot what high school
we go to?

16:19.291 --> 16:20.875
There-- there's no,
nothing about winning,

16:20.875 --> 16:23.417
nothing about go
and kill those motherfuckers,
there's nothing!

16:23.417 --> 16:24.750
Snodgrass:
Okay, calm down.

16:24.750 --> 16:26.458
The girls have been working
very hard on this,

16:26.458 --> 16:29.291
and it's not like
the decorations are gonna
win us the game anyway.

16:29.291 --> 16:32.125
Please do not underestimate
the decorations, okay?

16:32.125 --> 16:33.542
We could use
all the help we can get.

16:33.542 --> 16:35.750
I mean, Taylor, you are
a beautiful young lady,

16:35.750 --> 16:38.208
but what you're working on here,
it's horse shit.

16:38.208 --> 16:40.375
You might as well just come out
in the middle of the pep rally,

16:40.375 --> 16:42.750
bend over, and fart.
Okay? Because it's nothing.

16:42.750 --> 16:45.041
What you've done is
a fart in the wind.

16:45.041 --> 16:46.417
Bleh.

16:47.333 --> 16:50.583
(school bell chimes)

16:56.583 --> 16:58.041
(engine starts)
(sobbing)

16:58.041 --> 17:01.250
(sobbing)

17:12.750 --> 17:14.667
Come on, you grease monkey!
Let's go!

17:14.667 --> 17:17.250
Hey, Dad.
Ray is just teaching me
how to do an oil change.

17:17.250 --> 17:18.417
Ooh.

17:18.417 --> 17:20.750
Well, clean up your hands.
Come on, I'm starvin'.

17:22.792 --> 17:23.875
Ray:
Gambo!

17:23.875 --> 17:26.625
Car is lookin' good.
Thank you, Ray.

17:27.750 --> 17:29.500
So you pumped
for the big game
tomorrow night?

17:29.500 --> 17:31.792
Yes. Probably more than you are
'cause I work at the school,

17:31.792 --> 17:33.542
unlike you, who is
involved for no reason.

17:33.542 --> 17:34.875
Well, not no reason.

17:34.875 --> 17:37.041
You know Percival is
my alma mater, right?

17:37.041 --> 17:39.250
Purple and silver
all the way.
(scuffs ground)

17:39.250 --> 17:40.583
Percival Rams forever!

17:40.583 --> 17:42.708
Whoo!
Jesus, Ray.

17:42.708 --> 17:44.291
I don't know
if you know this or not,

17:44.291 --> 17:46.291
but the reputation
around town is

17:46.291 --> 17:47.708
that people that go
to Percival suck.

17:47.708 --> 17:49.375
Percival is gonna win.
No, they will not.

17:49.375 --> 17:50.834
Percival is gonna win.
Warriors will win.

17:50.834 --> 17:52.208
Percival is gonna win.
Warriors will win.

17:52.208 --> 17:53.667
Don't talk about stuff
you don't know about.

17:53.667 --> 17:55.792
I think I know
about the high school
football teams, Ray,

17:55.792 --> 17:56.959
and it's gonna be
the Warriors.

17:56.959 --> 17:58.625
Well, I'll see you
tomorrow night, okay?

17:58.625 --> 17:59.750
Yes, you will.

17:59.750 --> 18:02.083
And you won't be happy
when we beat your ass!

18:03.125 --> 18:04.834
Percival!

18:08.417 --> 18:10.125
There you boys are.

18:10.125 --> 18:12.000
I thought I told you all
you were grounded.

18:12.000 --> 18:13.667
You said grounded
to the hotel.

18:13.667 --> 18:16.125
This is the hotel, right?
You know I meant the room.

18:16.125 --> 18:17.750
So, you need
to get up there right now.

18:17.750 --> 18:19.500
Man, that room stink.
You know what?

18:19.500 --> 18:23.333
You'll think about that
the next time you call
your mother an asshole.

18:29.333 --> 18:31.500
Momma, have you been crying?

18:31.500 --> 18:35.166
What do you care
if an asshole's been crying?

18:36.500 --> 18:38.500
Look, Momma, we did not
burn down the house.

18:38.500 --> 18:39.708
Okay? I promise you.

18:40.750 --> 18:42.834
I know you all didn't
burn down that house.

18:42.834 --> 18:43.875
I believe you.

18:43.875 --> 18:47.875
And I know moving here
hasn't been easy.

18:47.875 --> 18:50.583
(sighs)
You guys didn't have
a say in the matter.

18:50.583 --> 18:53.166
And I just needed to be
some place your dad wasn't.

18:53.166 --> 18:56.000
I needed a...
I needed a fresh start.

18:56.000 --> 18:58.041
I should've asked you guys
how you felt.

18:59.333 --> 19:00.708
I'm sorry.

19:00.708 --> 19:02.417
I was wrong.

19:02.417 --> 19:03.917
Mario:
It's okay.

19:03.917 --> 19:05.166
Let's just move back.

19:05.166 --> 19:07.542
Yeah. It won't be like
a failure or nothing.

19:07.542 --> 19:09.375
It'll just be
like we saying,

19:09.375 --> 19:11.208
"Nah," and heading on.

19:11.208 --> 19:13.500
Yeah, Momma.
Can we please go home?

19:16.959 --> 19:18.959
People say we're not
very good this year

19:18.959 --> 19:20.708
because we only beat Derby High.

19:20.708 --> 19:23.208
But Derby High was
actually pretty good.

19:23.208 --> 19:25.000
And we're good too.

19:25.000 --> 19:27.208
And we're gonna be good
in the game against Percival.

19:27.208 --> 19:30.500
Maybe we'll even
beat those guys.

19:30.500 --> 19:32.166
(applause)

19:32.166 --> 19:33.792
Whoo.

19:35.583 --> 19:36.917
Jesus Christ.

19:36.917 --> 19:39.041
None of these students have
any goddamn school spirit.

19:39.041 --> 19:40.458
Look at Brown.

19:40.458 --> 19:42.917
She's all fucked out.

19:42.917 --> 19:44.625
♪ Doo, doo, doo ♪

19:44.625 --> 19:46.125
Game over.

19:46.125 --> 19:47.291
Game over.

19:47.291 --> 19:49.583
So thanks for coming out
and showing your school spirit!

19:49.583 --> 19:51.083
Go Warriors!

19:51.083 --> 19:52.750
(scattered cheers)

19:55.500 --> 19:56.667
Taylor:
Yeah!

19:56.667 --> 19:58.750
Oh, this ought
to be interesting.

19:58.750 --> 20:01.750
Mostly everyone at--
May I have the floor
for a second?

20:01.750 --> 20:02.875
Thank you.

20:07.917 --> 20:09.333
Belinda:
All right.

20:09.333 --> 20:11.625
In the last week, um...

20:11.625 --> 20:13.291
I lost my house...

20:14.250 --> 20:15.625
had my car vandalized,

20:15.625 --> 20:19.250
had disparaging words
graffitied about me.

20:19.250 --> 20:21.083
And I'm not proud to admit

20:21.083 --> 20:23.667
that the whole
circumstance got me...

20:23.667 --> 20:27.125
well, acting like an asshole.

20:27.125 --> 20:28.708
(audience gasps, laughs)

20:28.708 --> 20:30.250
Is she drunk?
Belinda: It's true.

20:30.250 --> 20:31.458
Who cares?

20:31.458 --> 20:33.291
I lost my cool
several times

20:33.291 --> 20:37.542
and I misjudged those
I've come to count on the most.

20:37.542 --> 20:42.375
See, sometimes,
it's easy to assume the worst

20:42.375 --> 20:45.458
in people when you think
you know their history.

20:45.458 --> 20:49.917
But I am standing here
today as living proof

20:49.917 --> 20:53.041
that we get to rewrite
our history

20:53.041 --> 20:56.500
every single goddamn day!

20:56.500 --> 20:59.708
(audience gasps)
I know you all believe

20:59.708 --> 21:03.500
that this school has lost
to Percival at homecoming

21:03.500 --> 21:05.792
every year
for the last seven years.

21:05.792 --> 21:07.333
Nine years!

21:07.333 --> 21:08.750
Nine?
Student: Nine.

21:08.750 --> 21:11.041
Damn. Okay, okay.
(laughter)

21:11.041 --> 21:15.417
Still, I know you think
that we're gonna lose tonight.

21:15.417 --> 21:18.834
Hm? That we're just
no damn good!

21:18.834 --> 21:20.041
Bull!

21:20.041 --> 21:23.834
I refuse to write that history.

21:23.834 --> 21:26.041
The history that
I write tonight says

21:26.041 --> 21:29.625
that we're going to rise up

21:29.625 --> 21:31.375
and kick some ass!

21:31.375 --> 21:33.708
Come on!
(loud cheers and applause)

21:36.333 --> 21:37.667
Whoo! Let's go blue!
Yeah!

21:37.667 --> 21:39.333
Hell yeah! Go Warriors!

21:39.333 --> 21:41.708
Damn right, Ron Eggart.
I see you!

21:42.750 --> 21:44.875
And I see you too, Jason Pepper.

21:44.875 --> 21:47.500
Oh, and I see you,
Beth Chapman!
(girls giggle)

21:47.500 --> 21:49.667
Fuck me. She learned
their goddamn names.

21:49.667 --> 21:52.041
I see all of y'all!

21:52.041 --> 21:54.083
(cheering)

21:56.166 --> 21:57.125
Together,

21:57.125 --> 22:00.583
we will rewrite
this school's history.

22:00.583 --> 22:03.875
And that history starts today.

22:03.875 --> 22:08.125
Right goddamn now!

22:08.125 --> 22:10.000
(cheering wildly)

22:13.208 --> 22:15.375
Whoo!

22:18.375 --> 22:20.291
Girl:
Come on, we can do it!

22:25.250 --> 22:28.542
Let's win this
for fucking Dr. Brown!

22:28.542 --> 22:30.458
(loud cheering)

22:37.917 --> 22:39.583
Jesus Christ,
I did not see this coming.

22:39.583 --> 22:42.041
That soaring, fucking
rhetoric of hers!

22:42.041 --> 22:43.417
I gotta admit,
it was pretty good.

22:43.417 --> 22:45.250
I could've done
without the profanities
of course--

22:45.250 --> 22:47.083
Do you have any idea
what will happen

22:47.083 --> 22:48.750
if we win this game?

22:48.750 --> 22:52.542
Everything that
we have worked for
will be for nothing.

22:52.542 --> 22:54.333
(sighs)
Now, we need to make sure

22:54.333 --> 22:57.083
that Jackson is crushed
by Percival.

22:57.083 --> 22:59.792
Oh, come on, Russell.
We don't have a choice.

22:59.792 --> 23:02.500
Look, this is it.
Everything is on the line.

23:02.500 --> 23:04.583
If Jackson wins, we lose.

23:04.583 --> 23:06.834
And if we lose, we win.

23:06.834 --> 23:10.625
And if we dose them
with Barry Weiss'
liquid acid LSD, we win.

23:10.625 --> 23:12.208
Are you talking about
dosing the team?

23:12.208 --> 23:13.792
Oh--
Are you out
of your fucking mind?

23:13.792 --> 23:15.792
We could go to jail
for 20 years for that.
Jesus.

23:15.792 --> 23:17.000
I'm just jokin', Gamby.

23:17.000 --> 23:18.625
Everybody always
says that about you.

23:18.625 --> 23:20.375
"Gamby has no idea
when I'm jokin'."

23:20.375 --> 23:21.834
I'll think of somethin'.

23:21.834 --> 23:23.792
You know, if it's a couple
hits of acid or whatever--

23:23.792 --> 23:25.333
I mean, not that,
but you know.

23:25.333 --> 23:27.708
No, I can tell that the plan
for you is still to do the acid.

23:27.708 --> 23:29.917
Look, Russell, we actually have
a chance to beat Percival here.

23:29.917 --> 23:32.458
Who fuckin' cares, Gamby?
Really, who fuckin' cares?

23:32.458 --> 23:35.792
Now, you need to just go home
and just relax.

23:35.792 --> 23:37.000
I'll handle it.

23:37.000 --> 23:38.792
No fuckin' acid.
Hey, Mr. Gamby.

23:38.792 --> 23:40.542
Hello, Taylor.

I'm fantastic.

24:05.125 --> 24:07.083
These are my sons
Mario and Luke.

24:07.083 --> 24:09.500
Uh-huh. I see
the resemblance.

24:09.500 --> 24:11.708
And this is Zachary,
my in vitro child.

24:11.708 --> 24:13.000
Hmm, wonderful.

24:13.000 --> 24:15.041
I just want to thank you
for everything.
Why thank me?

24:15.041 --> 24:16.500
Well, I took
your advice to heart.

24:16.500 --> 24:18.625
When I left Percival,
I had a clear vision

24:18.625 --> 24:21.667
of what it is
I need to do.
Hm?

24:21.667 --> 24:24.959
I need to fuckin' annihilate you
and your candy-ass school,

24:24.959 --> 24:26.542
and tonight,
I'm gonna bury you

24:26.542 --> 24:29.041
and those buttoned-up
pancake titties of yours

24:29.041 --> 24:31.166
out in the end zone.
(boys snicker)

24:31.166 --> 24:32.250
Good luck tonight.

24:32.250 --> 24:33.375

I've already just done?
I just did it.

25:16.333 --> 25:18.125
Lee, we'll take down
Belinda Brown,

25:18.125 --> 25:20.041
but not at the expense
of North Jackson High.

25:20.041 --> 25:21.750

25:21.750 --> 25:22.917

25:22.917 --> 25:24.542

I told you, Gamby,

25:24.542 --> 25:26.250
I don't give a fuck
about athletics!

25:26.250 --> 25:28.041
