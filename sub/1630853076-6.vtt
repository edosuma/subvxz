WEBVTT

00:08.834 --> 00:11.881
What's the world coming to?

00:12.012 --> 00:13.274
Tear that goddamn sheriff
apart.

00:13.404 --> 00:15.363
Don't end up like a hare
in the goddamn hunt.

00:15.493 --> 00:17.495
Everything I've done
has been for you, brother.

00:17.626 --> 00:19.062
What about the scars
on my back?

00:19.193 --> 00:21.108
Nathan, I don't want
to marry you.

00:21.238 --> 00:22.326
Whore!

00:23.501 --> 00:24.763
Shh.

00:24.894 --> 00:26.330
It's yours
if you let her go.

00:26.461 --> 00:27.940
I can't be the reason
you give it all up.

00:28.071 --> 00:30.291
Steve should be here,
but he's in town

00:30.421 --> 00:33.033
weeping over his whore.

00:33.163 --> 00:35.296
I plow the dry earth
every day

00:35.426 --> 00:36.906
so that I'll be ready
when it rains.

00:55.838 --> 00:59.537
Tell me who
gave you those scars.

00:59.668 --> 01:03.672
-Tell me who gave you
those scars.

01:08.720 --> 01:10.983
Why do you care?

01:11.114 --> 01:12.985
'Cause I've been searching
for that son of a bitch

01:13.116 --> 01:14.117
for most of my goddamn life.

01:17.903 --> 01:21.820
Don't make me skin you alive,
Sheriff, 'cause I will.

01:21.951 --> 01:22.908
Believe me.

01:24.475 --> 01:28.131
All right.
Let me get up.

01:28.262 --> 01:30.699
As you can see,
I'm uncomfortable.

01:30.829 --> 01:32.962
It just makes me...

01:33.093 --> 01:34.050
If you make a move...

01:34.181 --> 01:35.878
All right.

01:36.008 --> 01:38.228
I know, I know.

01:39.751 --> 01:40.448
All right.

01:47.542 --> 01:49.021
Tell me.

01:51.023 --> 01:53.983
Tell me his fucking name!

01:54.114 --> 01:55.811
Bronson, you fuck!

02:12.088 --> 02:13.263
Drop it.

04:20.216 --> 04:22.305
You know, Martin,
Thompson was right.

04:27.092 --> 04:28.485
So was Steve.

04:44.719 --> 04:46.895
You see?

04:47.025 --> 04:49.071
In the end, it came.

04:49.201 --> 04:50.333
Go on.

05:01.953 --> 05:03.346
You do it.

05:03.477 --> 05:04.434
Go on.

05:07.916 --> 05:09.787
We'll try it together.

05:09.918 --> 05:11.311
Okay, here we go.

05:11.876 --> 05:14.009
One, two, three.

05:29.981 --> 05:30.678
Go on, go see.

05:56.747 --> 05:58.401
It might take a few minutes.

05:58.532 --> 06:00.490
Go play, I'll come get
you when it happens.

06:01.796 --> 06:02.710
Go on.

06:18.552 --> 06:20.292
I've wronged you.

06:21.990 --> 06:23.992
I know.

06:24.122 --> 06:26.908
Like the worst kind of
man, I've offended you,

06:27.038 --> 06:29.084
and betrayed you--

06:29.214 --> 06:31.391
You've been betraying
me for years, Steve.

06:35.743 --> 06:36.831
You think I never knew?

06:39.442 --> 06:41.662
It was a price I was willing
to pay to stay with you

06:41.792 --> 06:43.533
because Dorian needed
a father, but, Jesus...

06:46.188 --> 06:49.365
Never would I have
thought you'd let us

06:49.496 --> 06:54.022
sweat, and starve, and
despair like we have,

06:54.152 --> 06:56.111
while, all this time,
we've been sitting
over a goldmine.

06:56.241 --> 06:57.634
-That gold is evil--
-Stop!

06:57.765 --> 07:00.898
I'm tired of listening
to your hypocrisy.

07:01.029 --> 07:02.726
It wasn't so evil you
couldn't use it to try

07:02.857 --> 07:05.294
and save that whore
from being hanged!

07:11.300 --> 07:14.477
You know, it's only now I see
you for what you really are.

07:18.394 --> 07:21.571
Do you think you're
some kind of martyr?

07:21.702 --> 07:24.226
You're as hateful as
the men you oppose.

07:30.885 --> 07:32.277
You should have asked
us for permission

07:32.408 --> 07:33.583
to make us live like this.

07:46.857 --> 07:49.164
Shouldn't you be
outside working, Steve?

08:26.593 --> 08:27.507
What can I do for you?

08:33.034 --> 08:34.775
We're here for the
Federal Bank money.

08:37.908 --> 08:41.738
Well, as you can see,
this ain't a bank no more.

08:49.441 --> 08:51.574
Let's...

08:51.705 --> 08:53.315
approach this a
little differently.

08:55.143 --> 08:56.013
Where's McCoy?

09:02.542 --> 09:05.457
I don't know who you are

09:05.588 --> 09:07.851
or what you want from him,

09:07.982 --> 09:10.637
but if you ain't up and
out of that goddamn chair

09:10.767 --> 09:12.769
by count of three,

09:12.900 --> 09:14.423
-I'm gonna--

09:20.298 --> 09:21.691
Drop it.

09:31.483 --> 09:32.833
Where is McCoy?

09:47.978 --> 09:49.501
We...
We haven't seen him in days.

09:53.984 --> 09:56.421
He was out the far
side of the canyon,

09:56.552 --> 09:58.685
but the bridge has collapsed.

09:58.815 --> 10:00.904
If he's still alive,
my best guess is

10:01.035 --> 10:02.297
he'll be coming back
through the mines.

10:02.427 --> 10:06.040
The mines? Where...
Where are the mines?

10:06.170 --> 10:08.085
Not too far.

10:08.216 --> 10:10.653
Take the path east of town

10:10.784 --> 10:12.307
and pass the abandoned
house in Condor,

10:12.437 --> 10:13.395
you'll be there.

11:04.054 --> 11:04.794
Fuck.

11:29.906 --> 11:31.778
Nice, huh?

11:31.908 --> 11:35.390
How much do you reckon
it would be worth?

11:35.520 --> 11:37.174
Let's go get this
fucking sheriff.

11:45.530 --> 11:48.620
Less than two
hours and we're home.

11:48.751 --> 11:50.971
How long ago did
he give you those scars?

11:51.101 --> 11:53.060
Oh, shut up,
Red, for Christ's sake.

11:53.190 --> 11:55.627
Look, at least just tell
me where it happened.

11:55.758 --> 11:56.933
I just wanna talk to him.

11:59.283 --> 12:02.634
You know, I grew up in a
place called Abbey Town.

12:02.765 --> 12:03.810
I've never heard of it.

12:05.246 --> 12:06.029
Hold her!

12:07.596 --> 12:09.380
Take it easy.
Easy.

12:09.511 --> 12:11.165
Easy now.

12:11.295 --> 12:13.907
It's just a woman.

12:14.037 --> 12:16.561
Footsteps
coming up the stairs,

12:16.692 --> 12:18.476
and then her screams,

12:18.607 --> 12:21.175
as he cut that mark
into her, Sheriff.

12:21.305 --> 12:22.611
Just like he did to you.

12:22.742 --> 12:23.351
Please, leave!

12:23.481 --> 12:25.309
Leave us alone!

12:26.484 --> 12:27.485
Please, leave.

12:27.616 --> 12:29.226
In the name of God, please, no!

12:29.357 --> 12:30.010
Ah!

12:32.186 --> 12:34.449
But deeper.

12:34.579 --> 12:35.450
Please, stop!

12:43.284 --> 12:45.547
She saw my face?

12:49.159 --> 12:51.901
The things we do
for money.

12:55.296 --> 12:56.776
I was eight.

13:07.743 --> 13:08.918
You were just a boy.

14:19.597 --> 14:21.512
It's Thompson.

14:21.643 --> 14:22.949
There's no need to be scared.

14:30.565 --> 14:32.480
Ooh-wee.

14:32.610 --> 14:35.570
Looks like little brother's got
himself a taste for dynamite.

14:39.052 --> 14:41.097
Remember how this
town used to be?

14:43.926 --> 14:48.235
Finally, we'll get back to
being that City of Gold.

14:55.938 --> 14:58.854
So, that's why you've been
going around the country

14:58.985 --> 15:01.117
chopping people's heads off.

15:02.423 --> 15:03.946
Revenge.

15:04.077 --> 15:05.600
I guess
you can say that.

15:07.602 --> 15:11.823
You wasted your entire life
searching for an asshole.

15:13.042 --> 15:15.784
-15 years.
-15 years.

15:17.351 --> 15:19.744
In all that time,
how close you come?

15:19.875 --> 15:22.747
Well, now I know his name.

15:22.878 --> 15:23.792
That's right.

15:23.923 --> 15:25.533
-I guess you do.

15:31.974 --> 15:34.585
We wanna talk
to you about the money!

15:34.716 --> 15:36.065
The Federal Bank money!

15:42.593 --> 15:43.812
Fuck!

15:59.828 --> 16:01.047
Good luck.

16:06.617 --> 16:07.705
Red!

16:07.836 --> 16:09.229
Don't fucking move!

16:28.422 --> 16:30.685
-I'm empty.

16:30.815 --> 16:31.468
Kurt, I'm empty.

16:36.386 --> 16:37.518
Aw, shit!

16:37.648 --> 16:38.301
Reloading.

16:38.432 --> 16:39.346
Hang tight, buddy.

16:41.391 --> 16:42.697
-I'm out.

17:11.682 --> 17:12.944
Stop.

17:29.657 --> 17:30.962
Marco?

17:33.226 --> 17:34.618
Blaine.

17:41.799 --> 17:43.888
Oh, shit.

17:44.019 --> 17:46.587
I can't wait to see
your brother's face.

17:46.717 --> 17:49.764
I have to tell you,
I imagined you as a businessman,

17:49.894 --> 17:53.202
a cowherd, a family man
with a string of ugly brats.

17:53.333 --> 17:57.511
I even imagined you as a priest,
for Chrissake, but never,

17:57.641 --> 18:00.079
never a fucking sheriff.

18:01.863 --> 18:04.779
Well, you never struck me as a
man with a great imagination.

18:08.957 --> 18:10.567
How did you find me?

18:10.698 --> 18:12.917
Your damn deputies told us
which way you might be coming.

18:13.048 --> 18:14.136
It doesn't take much imagination

18:14.267 --> 18:16.747
to guess what happened next.

18:16.878 --> 18:20.969
Marco, you know how we
are about witnesses.

18:21.100 --> 18:23.363
But I am sorry
about your friend.

18:23.493 --> 18:27.497
If he had family, they
will lack for nothing.

18:27.628 --> 18:30.848
Will you look at that?

18:30.979 --> 18:33.329
Generosity and kindness.

18:34.504 --> 18:35.679
You've changed.

18:41.990 --> 18:43.557
I was his only family.

18:44.862 --> 18:46.647
And what
about the third?

18:46.777 --> 18:48.127
There were three of you.

18:51.782 --> 18:52.827
Excuse me?

18:52.957 --> 18:54.002
You heard me.

18:54.133 --> 18:56.178
Mind your own goddamn business.

18:57.571 --> 18:59.094
He was my prisoner.

18:59.225 --> 19:01.183
Blaine, I would never
have taken that money

19:01.314 --> 19:02.793
had I known it was yours.

19:02.924 --> 19:05.318
I know that.

19:05.448 --> 19:08.190
Now why don't I go
and get the money,

19:08.321 --> 19:10.410
and I clean up this mess?

19:10.540 --> 19:11.802
There is no mess.

19:11.933 --> 19:13.195
There's no hurry.

19:13.326 --> 19:14.544
-You and me...

19:14.675 --> 19:17.068
We're celebrating our reunion.

19:17.199 --> 19:18.896
Listen, you fellas
might like to do that,

19:19.027 --> 19:21.899
but I think it's near time
we put an end to this mess.

19:22.030 --> 19:24.859
That money's on an abandoned
farm. I can go myself.

19:24.989 --> 19:27.557
Yeah, right, like you think
we're gonna let you go alone?

19:27.688 --> 19:32.562
Are you gonna let him
talk to you like that?

19:32.693 --> 19:34.869
-You've changed.
-I'm still Sheriff, Blaine.

19:34.999 --> 19:38.220
I can't be seen with the men
who murdered my deputies.

19:38.351 --> 19:40.440
All right.

19:40.570 --> 19:43.007
Let's just you and
me go together then.

19:43.138 --> 19:44.879
Catch up on old times.

19:45.009 --> 19:47.925
You know, I gotta say, it's
nice that you two are so close,

19:48.056 --> 19:50.014
but I ain't running the risk
of going back to Bronson

19:50.145 --> 19:52.365
without that money.

19:52.495 --> 19:55.629
-If I killed you right now,

19:55.759 --> 20:00.068
there's not a soul on this
Earth that would give a shit.

20:00.199 --> 20:02.679
Especially not my
fucking brother.

20:02.810 --> 20:06.074
-Shoot the mouthy fuck,

20:06.205 --> 20:09.208
or put the gun down.

20:18.565 --> 20:21.698
This is the Marco
I used to know.

20:32.840 --> 20:37.105
Blaine, I would
rather come with you.

20:39.020 --> 20:40.717
Don't worry.

20:40.848 --> 20:41.892
Let's go!

20:42.023 --> 20:43.590
We'll be back by dark.

20:43.720 --> 20:45.113
We're not
gonna make it by dark.

20:45.244 --> 20:48.290
Besides, don't wanna pass
too close to Greenvale,

20:48.421 --> 20:50.118
not after the mess
you guys caused.

20:51.641 --> 20:53.034
I suggest we take
a different route.

20:53.774 --> 20:54.688
So?

20:55.819 --> 20:57.386
So...

20:59.170 --> 21:00.128
tomorrow.

21:01.651 --> 21:05.568
All right. We'll see you
here tomorrow morning.

21:05.699 --> 21:08.528
-Hmm. Hey.

21:10.617 --> 21:11.487
Ah, of course.

21:14.360 --> 21:16.057
You'll choke on
those balls one day.

21:35.294 --> 21:38.122
-Symone,

21:38.253 --> 21:39.776
what have you done?

21:41.169 --> 21:43.693
I couldn't leave her there.

21:43.824 --> 21:45.086
I couldn't.

21:46.043 --> 21:48.437
Gather the girls, Susan.

22:05.149 --> 22:08.022
I wanna change her
hair to the red.

22:08.152 --> 22:09.850
Go and get it.

22:09.980 --> 22:12.461
We can't, it's still wet.

22:14.333 --> 22:16.160
She's fine with this one.

22:16.291 --> 22:18.467
The red one, I said.

22:20.426 --> 22:22.602
The red one's her favorite.

22:22.732 --> 22:24.560
Do you understand? I know!

22:26.519 --> 22:29.609
Laura, get the wagon ready.

22:29.739 --> 22:33.352
Wanda, wrap all the jewelry
in rags and hide the money.

22:35.441 --> 22:36.485
Is that it?

22:38.444 --> 22:39.967
We're just gonna run away?

22:40.097 --> 22:41.925
We've already discussed this.

22:42.056 --> 22:44.972
With all this money, we
won't survive till sundown.

22:45.102 --> 22:47.540
-This is our town.
-Really?

22:47.670 --> 22:49.846
Look at what happened.

22:49.977 --> 22:53.023
They did this to her and nobody
lifted a finger to stop it.

22:53.154 --> 22:54.851
It was her own fault.

23:00.379 --> 23:02.119
She should have
waited for McCoy.

23:02.250 --> 23:05.122
She wanted to avenge you.

23:05.253 --> 23:06.646
And to protect us.

23:06.776 --> 23:07.821
She was stupid.

23:07.951 --> 23:10.127
Why don't you shut your mouth?

23:10.258 --> 23:13.087
She was angry 'cause
Steve rejected her.

23:13.217 --> 23:14.175
She was weak.

23:14.305 --> 23:15.785
She did the very opposite

23:15.916 --> 23:17.308
of what she's always
been teaching me.

23:17.439 --> 23:18.875
Not that you ever listened.

23:22.575 --> 23:23.445
What?

23:23.576 --> 23:26.361
She warned you about Nathan.

23:26.492 --> 23:27.884
She tried to make you understand

23:28.015 --> 23:31.018
that you were playing a
dangerous game with him. But no.

23:31.148 --> 23:34.108
The bored little whore had
to play at being a princess.

23:34.238 --> 23:37.459
-You know, fuck you!
-All right. Enough.

23:38.721 --> 23:40.070
Eve was right.

23:40.201 --> 23:43.204
You're just a
spoiled brat, Symone.

23:43.334 --> 23:45.075
Well,

23:47.251 --> 23:48.688
her death is on you.

23:48.818 --> 23:49.776
Susan...

25:17.124 --> 25:18.299
Marco.

25:22.912 --> 25:24.827
He's gonna
be governor, Marco.

25:24.958 --> 25:28.265
And when that happens,
everything is gonna change.

25:28.396 --> 25:30.398
New rules.

25:30.529 --> 25:32.443
New opportunities.

25:34.271 --> 25:36.012
Yeah, right.

25:37.274 --> 25:40.626
You wouldn't recognize him now.

25:40.756 --> 25:43.585
If he wasn't drenched in
blood, I probably wouldn't.

25:45.892 --> 25:47.502
Your brother loves
you, you dumb bastard.

25:47.633 --> 25:50.636
He spent a fucking fortune
trying to find you.

25:50.766 --> 25:53.334
He ever tell you why
we parted company?

25:53.464 --> 25:55.379
No.

25:55.510 --> 25:57.686
Why don't you tell me?

25:57.817 --> 25:59.558
Believe me, you
don't wanna know.

26:04.040 --> 26:06.390
Well, at least tell me
why you would order

26:06.521 --> 26:09.350
the hanging of
such a sublime beauty.

26:10.699 --> 26:12.527
What are you talking about?

26:12.658 --> 26:15.704
The name was Eve
Margaret Hoover.

26:32.025 --> 26:33.287
She's dead?

26:34.114 --> 26:36.551
Shit.

26:36.682 --> 26:40.860
You didn't give the order?

26:40.990 --> 26:43.863
Apparently she killed
the only remaining deputy

26:43.993 --> 26:44.864
we didn't take care of.

26:46.735 --> 26:48.476
I'm sorry, Marco.

26:50.130 --> 26:52.523
I'm sorry for your loss.

28:07.076 --> 28:09.905
You're too late.
They've taken everything.

28:10.036 --> 28:12.038
-I know who you are.

28:14.780 --> 28:16.477
What were you looking for?

28:16.607 --> 28:18.261
A very bad guy.

28:18.392 --> 28:19.436
Like always.

28:19.567 --> 28:21.221
And did you find him?

28:21.351 --> 28:24.746
Not yet. But today I'm
closer than I was yesterday.

28:24.877 --> 28:26.835
And where will you look for him?

28:26.966 --> 28:29.098
Ain't you got nothing
better to do, kid?

28:29.229 --> 28:30.621
No.

28:30.752 --> 28:32.319
Some place more normal.

28:32.449 --> 28:35.191
Some place the bounty
register's actually used.

28:35.322 --> 28:38.107
-McCoy hates bounty hunters.
-I know.

28:38.238 --> 28:39.761
And where's a more
normal place than this?

28:39.892 --> 28:42.764
Far away. Look, just stop
following me, all right?

28:42.895 --> 28:44.984
And how will you get there?

28:45.114 --> 28:46.507
'Cause, if it's a train
you re looking for,

28:46.637 --> 28:48.552
you're going to need a ticket.

28:48.683 --> 28:50.206
That way.

29:01.522 --> 29:02.871
You're exactly the same.

29:05.352 --> 29:07.963
You're always running away,
or hunting someone down.

29:09.748 --> 29:11.010
You still his errand boy?

29:11.140 --> 29:13.360
-Fuck you.

29:20.497 --> 29:21.977
I'll give you half.

29:26.416 --> 29:29.202
It's more than enough to live
like a king till you'll die.

29:32.292 --> 29:34.729
Come on, you don't want
to do this forever.

29:34.860 --> 29:37.688
Always looking
over your shoulder,

29:37.819 --> 29:40.909
waiting for the day you see that
bullet with your name on it.

29:42.998 --> 29:46.480
I've found my place, Marco.

29:46.610 --> 29:48.917
I finally stopped running.

29:51.050 --> 29:51.920
What the fuck
have you found?

29:54.314 --> 29:55.271
You know what this is?

29:56.751 --> 29:58.013
-Christ, Blaine--
-No, wait.

29:58.144 --> 30:00.059
They only give this to you

30:00.189 --> 30:01.887
-when they're
ready to let you in.
-Those fucking little bastards!

30:02.017 --> 30:03.540
You're insane, you let
'em inside your head.

30:03.671 --> 30:05.281
-They fucking keep tabs on you--
-You're not listening.

30:05.412 --> 30:08.328
-Where you piss, where you shit.
-I spent 15 fucking years...

30:08.458 --> 30:10.243
-...waiting for this!
-Do you know what my
brother did?!

30:10.373 --> 30:11.505
Do you know what
my brother did?!

30:13.986 --> 30:15.291
What?

30:15.422 --> 30:16.727
Tell me.

30:20.340 --> 30:21.950
Tell me.

30:24.779 --> 30:26.825
When we parted company,

30:29.349 --> 30:31.481
he murdered them all.

30:34.006 --> 30:38.880
Christian, Michael, Ralph.

30:39.011 --> 30:41.187
For what?

30:41.317 --> 30:45.539
So that psycho bitch could
have her go on the cross,
that's what.

30:45.669 --> 30:48.324
What are you talking about?

30:48.455 --> 30:49.412
I'm telling you the truth.

30:55.027 --> 30:57.899
Stay away from those people.

30:58.030 --> 30:59.858
Those people?

31:00.815 --> 31:03.600
Those people...

31:03.731 --> 31:06.125
can change my life.

31:06.255 --> 31:11.565
Those people can make
me a free man. Me.

31:11.695 --> 31:14.133
You and your money, Marco,

31:14.263 --> 31:17.005
you don't have that power.

31:28.321 --> 31:30.323
You know, it hasn't
rained here in years.

31:34.283 --> 31:35.937
It's a miracle.

31:39.027 --> 31:41.116
I ain't coming with you.

31:41.247 --> 31:43.466
-Yes, you are.
-No, I'm not.

31:43.597 --> 31:46.513
No, I'll pay back every last
cent if that's what it takes.

31:49.690 --> 31:52.954
But I hope,

31:53.085 --> 31:55.217
that our past
friendship means,

31:55.348 --> 31:57.132
you won't tell my
brother you found me.

32:01.093 --> 32:03.399
It's too late, Marco.

32:03.530 --> 32:06.402
The men would have
already wired Bronson.

32:07.229 --> 32:09.188
I am sorry.

32:16.847 --> 32:18.719
Yeah, so am I.

32:18.849 --> 32:19.981
I know you are.

32:21.678 --> 32:24.159
Now, let's go.

32:24.290 --> 32:25.987
Your brother is gonna
be so happy to--

33:25.481 --> 33:29.920
Feels like we're
getting stronger every year,
doesn't it?

33:30.051 --> 33:33.359
Can I talk to you?

33:33.489 --> 33:35.056
You're
worried about tomorrow?

33:39.191 --> 33:40.061
Hellen,

33:40.192 --> 33:42.020
I gotta leave.

33:44.065 --> 33:44.848
What are you talking about?

33:44.979 --> 33:47.373
My brother's been found.

33:50.898 --> 33:54.075
-Your brother?
-That's right. Yes.

33:54.206 --> 33:56.425
I'll be back in
two or three days,

33:56.556 --> 33:59.994
and once I am, we can
celebrate my nomination--

34:00.125 --> 34:01.996
To hell with the nomination.

34:02.127 --> 34:06.000
-We're here for something else.
-Yes.

34:06.131 --> 34:07.567
Yeah, which we do every year.

34:07.697 --> 34:10.178
What's the problem my
missing it this once?

34:11.788 --> 34:13.964
Have you forgotten
the vow that you made?

34:14.095 --> 34:16.097
Nothing matters outside of us.

34:16.228 --> 34:18.534
Marco matters.

34:18.665 --> 34:19.492
He's my family.

34:19.622 --> 34:21.537
But he abandoned you.

34:21.668 --> 34:23.539
I'm your family.

34:25.715 --> 34:27.369
I freed you.

34:27.500 --> 34:29.763
-I took care of you.
-Yeah.

34:34.420 --> 34:35.290
Carlo,

34:36.726 --> 34:37.684
I know you.

34:37.814 --> 34:39.207
Yeah, that's all true.

34:42.297 --> 34:43.864
So you know what
this means to me.

34:47.911 --> 34:51.306
My boys have found him near
a place called Greenvale,

34:51.437 --> 34:52.742
and I'm gonna go get him.

34:52.873 --> 34:54.004
Your "boys?"

34:54.135 --> 34:55.702
You sound like a goddamn bandit.

34:55.832 --> 34:58.183
That's right.

34:58.313 --> 35:01.882
If you don't return
before that carriage arrives
tomorrow,

35:02.012 --> 35:03.013
you'll lose everything.

35:10.282 --> 35:11.152
Bronson!

35:15.461 --> 35:17.158
You need to think
before you challenge me.

35:39.006 --> 35:42.836
I need a ticket to Trenton
or Southspire, today.

35:42.966 --> 35:44.533
There is nothing for today.

35:44.664 --> 35:46.187
There is one for
tomorrow afternoon.

35:46.318 --> 35:47.667
Yeah, that's too late.

35:47.797 --> 35:50.148
-Sorry.
-Relax, I ain't gonna hurt you.

35:51.758 --> 35:52.802
Get me the ticket.

35:54.326 --> 35:55.501
You got any peyote?

35:57.546 --> 35:59.244
Concasse?

35:59.374 --> 36:01.594
Ayahuasca roots maybe?

36:02.595 --> 36:03.335
Top shelf.

36:04.684 --> 36:05.293
Yeah.

36:16.739 --> 36:17.914
For the herbs...

36:18.045 --> 36:19.438
the ticket...

36:21.396 --> 36:23.093
for the door.

36:28.142 --> 36:29.056
Thank you.

36:29.187 --> 36:30.188
Good day.

43:12.502 --> 43:14.504
Bronson.

44:46.379 --> 44:51.384
Fuck!
