WEBVTT

00:57.056 --> 00:59.100
Good luck, baby Willa.

01:57.784 --> 02:01.329
Chili-chili-chila!
Willi-willi-Willa!

02:01.412 --> 02:04.707
Birthday chili brewed to perfection!

02:04.791 --> 02:06.668
Ection, ection…

02:08.253 --> 02:10.130
I'm so proud my birthday girl

02:10.213 --> 02:13.133
ordered her dad's special chili
for her birthday dinner.

02:13.216 --> 02:15.093
-Wouldn't be my birthday without it.
-Oh.

02:15.760 --> 02:19.764
Now, I know you wanted
a phone, but I think…

02:21.099 --> 02:24.018
you're going to like this even more.

02:28.815 --> 02:30.817
Come on, open it!

02:44.539 --> 02:47.709
Whoa. "Property of Willow Ward."

02:53.006 --> 02:55.550
Wow.

02:56.050 --> 02:59.554
-It was your mom's.

03:00.388 --> 03:04.183
She wanted you to have it when you were
old enough to know what to do with it.

03:04.267 --> 03:07.604
Now I'm no fashion expert,
but I figured 12 years old,

03:07.687 --> 03:09.898
you're old enough to know
how to wear a necklace.

03:11.274 --> 03:13.902
She used to pull my leg
and tell me it was magic.

03:14.652 --> 03:16.738
Your mom would always say,

03:17.238 --> 03:21.117
"Believe in magic
and life will be magical."

03:24.078 --> 03:26.122
-Can you help me put it on?
-Yeah.

03:37.592 --> 03:41.262
So, how do I look?

03:42.180 --> 03:43.640
As beautiful as your mom,

03:43.723 --> 03:46.476
and she was
the most beautiful woman in the world.

03:48.519 --> 03:52.273
Thank you for trusting me with this, Dad.
I'll wear it forever.

03:54.817 --> 03:56.069
Happy birthday, sweetheart.

03:58.947 --> 03:59.781
Chili.

04:00.365 --> 04:03.493
Chili.

04:03.576 --> 04:05.119
Okay, birthday girl,

04:05.203 --> 04:08.414
you better put on a jacket
because this stuff is chili.

04:31.104 --> 04:35.316
It couldn't be. After all this time.

04:38.736 --> 04:42.031
Looks like they didn't leave it
with great-uncle William.

04:42.115 --> 04:43.866
Scratch another loser off the list.

04:43.950 --> 04:48.621
Twelve years of searching
and another dead end.

04:48.705 --> 04:50.039
We'll never find it in time.

04:50.623 --> 04:51.541
I don't know, Wilma.

04:51.624 --> 04:55.461
Maybe if you chipped in and did a little
digging, we might just find it, okay?

04:56.796 --> 04:59.340
Oh yeah. Huh, that's a huge help.

05:01.551 --> 05:04.053
Oh. Wait, wait, wait.

05:04.137 --> 05:05.305
Was that…?

05:05.388 --> 05:06.639
Could it be?

05:06.723 --> 05:08.016
I think it was.

05:08.099 --> 05:10.727
-It is! It's back in Winding Way.

05:10.810 --> 05:15.523
I nearly blew off my perch. The amulet has
resurfaced and you'll never guess where.

05:15.606 --> 05:17.692
Does this mean we can stop digging?

05:17.775 --> 05:20.528
Don't count your eyeballs
before they blink, Sneak,

05:20.611 --> 05:23.448
but, as they say, maybe.

05:23.531 --> 05:25.616
You found the amulet?

05:25.700 --> 05:28.494
Hey, what are you doing? Stop.

05:29.078 --> 05:31.122
Uh-oh. Let's get out of here.

05:31.205 --> 05:34.584
-So long, mortal.

05:37.253 --> 05:41.883
I still can't believe it was
under our noses this whole time.

05:41.966 --> 05:42.967
Right there.

05:43.509 --> 05:47.472
Like, right there, in Willow's very house.

05:47.555 --> 05:49.348
-Bright side…
-Hm?

05:49.432 --> 05:51.809
-At least we found it.
-Oh, is that the bright side?

05:51.893 --> 05:52.727
-Yeah.
-Is it?

05:52.810 --> 05:54.270
Because we wasted, I don't know,

05:54.353 --> 05:56.647
over ten years of our lives
looking for it, so…

05:56.731 --> 05:58.816
It's fine.

06:00.610 --> 06:02.153
Sticky-Paws Fink,

06:02.653 --> 06:05.865
tomorrow you do what you do best.

06:05.948 --> 06:10.036
Whatever you need, boss.
Fink will not let you down.

06:10.620 --> 06:11.788
And finally…

06:12.747 --> 06:16.250
the amulet will be ours.

06:22.673 --> 06:23.966
Alright, let's go in.

06:40.483 --> 06:43.152
I guess I'll just stay out here.

06:45.446 --> 06:49.075
-Oh, hey, let's get this party started.

06:49.158 --> 06:50.076
Sorry I'm late,

06:50.159 --> 06:53.079
but coordinating for a slumber party
requires a lot of planning.

06:53.162 --> 06:56.082
Scout, you're not late.
You're 30 seconds early.

06:56.165 --> 06:58.376
Whew. You know I detest lateness.

07:00.878 --> 07:01.879
-Oh.

07:01.963 --> 07:02.797
Lucy!

07:04.423 --> 07:07.176
Let the Willa Ward birthday bonanza begin!

07:07.260 --> 07:09.595
-I couldn't find my bike anywhere.

07:09.679 --> 07:12.014
-I had to use my little brother's.

07:12.098 --> 07:13.891
Look Mr. Ward, can we cut to the chase?

07:14.475 --> 07:17.603
Everyone knows in your line of business,
your loot bags are the best.

07:18.187 --> 07:20.273
It'd be amazing
if we could break tradition

07:20.356 --> 07:22.525
and get into them a little early.

07:22.608 --> 07:27.071
Oh Scout, you know
flattery gets me every time.

07:27.155 --> 07:30.032
Hey, I didn't get into
the candy business for nothing, huh?

07:30.116 --> 07:33.244
-Let's go get some loot! Ha ha!

07:33.327 --> 07:34.537
There we are.

07:34.620 --> 07:36.497
-Dad, I think they know.
-Come on, Willa.

07:36.581 --> 07:39.375
-Ugh, fine.
-Don't wanna waste it.

07:41.961 --> 07:43.671
This is the best candy ever.

07:43.754 --> 07:46.257
Your dad slays it with the loot bags.

07:48.134 --> 07:51.012
Hey, girls. You sure you want to
sleep up in the attic tonight?

07:51.095 --> 07:54.849
Yeah, Dad. It's way more fun
to tell ghost stories up here.

07:54.932 --> 07:59.770
Okay. Well nothing too spooky, okay?
And lights out by midnight.

08:00.563 --> 08:01.481
Love you.

08:01.564 --> 08:02.773
Love you, Dad.

08:06.694 --> 08:07.528
Ready?

08:14.118 --> 08:15.620
It was hers.

08:15.703 --> 08:19.624
My dad wanted to wait until I was old
enough so I could take good care of it.

08:19.707 --> 08:21.709
Your mom had amazing taste.

08:22.293 --> 08:24.837
-That is so vintage.

08:24.921 --> 08:26.422
You never really talk about her.

08:27.173 --> 08:29.634
I don't know much about her.

08:30.134 --> 08:32.303
I would like to know more, but…

08:32.386 --> 08:38.184
I'm worried it makes Dad sad
if I'm always asking questions.

08:41.854 --> 08:45.983
Besides, it feels like
she's right here with us anyway.

08:50.488 --> 08:52.657
What's taking him so long?

08:53.199 --> 08:57.245
Never send a rat to do a cat's job.

08:57.787 --> 09:00.248
He's probably messing up as we speak.

09:00.331 --> 09:01.791
Come on.

09:05.461 --> 09:09.465
Since Halloween is coming,
this one is all about

09:09.549 --> 09:14.220
the legend of
the Three Witches of Winding Way.

09:19.433 --> 09:21.852
You know that legend is
totally made up, right?

09:21.936 --> 09:24.313
Who says?

09:29.652 --> 09:31.195
What was that?

09:33.364 --> 09:34.448
What was that?

09:45.751 --> 09:46.586
Eek!

09:49.755 --> 09:52.717
Oh, you were so not supposed to see me.

09:52.800 --> 09:55.761
What? Did you just… talk?

09:56.429 --> 09:57.388
Oops.

10:01.017 --> 10:03.519
Sorry to interrupt.
Pay no attention.

10:03.603 --> 10:06.272
You, you go back to what you were… doing.

10:09.400 --> 10:11.652
What's with all the screaming?
You're scaring me.

10:11.736 --> 10:13.779
Wait. He has my necklace!

10:13.863 --> 10:15.448
Eek! Bye.

10:15.531 --> 10:18.701
Where did it go?

10:18.784 --> 10:20.745
-Ew.
-Just forget I was ever here.

10:20.828 --> 10:23.289
Why is it talking?

10:23.372 --> 10:26.083
I am so
not touching that thing.

10:26.167 --> 10:28.210
No touching. Just…

10:29.545 --> 10:31.005
Get my necklace back.

10:36.093 --> 10:37.094
We have to find it.

10:41.432 --> 10:42.391
Bless you.

10:42.475 --> 10:43.517
Thanks.

10:47.521 --> 10:49.065
-Found him!

10:49.148 --> 10:51.942
-Corner him!
-Ha! Trapped like a rat.

10:58.407 --> 11:00.368
That is my mom's necklace.

11:00.451 --> 11:02.244
-Drop it.

11:02.328 --> 11:05.247
-Oh, no. Uh-oh. That's not right.

11:05.331 --> 11:07.291
I dropped it already. I dropped it.

11:44.328 --> 11:45.496
Uh…

11:53.879 --> 11:57.258
Whoa.

12:06.851 --> 12:08.144
What is happening?

12:08.227 --> 12:09.061
Willa!

12:09.145 --> 12:10.229
Stop, broom.

12:10.312 --> 12:11.897
Stop!

12:15.359 --> 12:17.778
What was that?

12:18.320 --> 12:19.947
I have no idea.

12:20.030 --> 12:21.907
Terrifying is what it was.

12:21.991 --> 12:23.909
Look out!

12:23.993 --> 12:25.161
Uh-oh.

12:25.244 --> 12:26.745
I gotta get out of here.

12:26.829 --> 12:28.956
-See ya later, kids.
-No!

12:29.790 --> 12:31.750
-Gotcha.

12:31.834 --> 12:33.461
Huh? No?

12:33.544 --> 12:36.088
Nothing? How about this?

12:38.132 --> 12:40.426
Nope, nope, nope.

12:40.509 --> 12:42.386
-Come on, let me out!
-Let's hide.

12:45.514 --> 12:48.851
You give me back my necklace,
I'll give you back your freedom.

12:48.934 --> 12:54.064
Uh, look, I wish I could,
but it's a long story. Trust me.

12:54.148 --> 12:57.109
Then you'll have to
stay in this jar forever,

12:57.193 --> 13:00.821
and soon, you'll get really hungry.

13:00.905 --> 13:05.993
-So, do we have a deal?
-Oh, alright, you got a deal.

13:11.165 --> 13:15.461
-Who are you anyway?

13:15.544 --> 13:18.506
Fine. Don't tell me.

13:18.589 --> 13:20.216
But you're lucky I love animals,

13:20.299 --> 13:23.511
or tonight wouldn't have
ended so well for you.

13:23.594 --> 13:27.806
Oh, Willa.
You're just like your mom. Heart of gold.

13:27.890 --> 13:31.519
Wait, did you just say
I'm just like… my mom?

13:31.602 --> 13:34.438
Fink, what's taking so long?

13:35.564 --> 13:39.568
Gotta go, Willa.
Uh, I mean, uh, whoever you are.

13:39.652 --> 13:43.489
What do you know about my mom?
And how do you know my name?

13:46.450 --> 13:47.535
Is it safe?

13:58.379 --> 14:00.756
Where did my mom get this?

14:05.678 --> 14:06.971
Where is he?

14:07.054 --> 14:09.431
-I'm here, I'm here, I'm here.

14:09.515 --> 14:11.475
Finally!

14:11.559 --> 14:15.729
First, the good news:
we've definitely found the necklace.

14:19.608 --> 14:21.694
-Amazing work, Fink.
-Great work.

14:21.777 --> 14:24.113
The moldiest cheese
for your dinner tonight.

14:24.196 --> 14:29.326
I was starting to think we couldn't
count on you, but you proved me wrong.

14:29.410 --> 14:31.745
You sure did, you little rat-Fink,

14:31.829 --> 14:38.419
stinky-eyed, poop-breath, nonsensical,
cat-fish whispering nightmare of a rat!

14:38.502 --> 14:39.336
Hand it over.

14:39.420 --> 14:43.716
Uh, you might want to save
the compliments for after the bad news,

14:43.799 --> 14:46.135
w-w-which is, um…

14:46.218 --> 14:47.052
She has it.

14:47.136 --> 14:51.223
Okay, you know all those compliments
I just gave you? I take them all back.

14:51.307 --> 14:52.474
She?

14:53.309 --> 14:54.476
-No.
-You don't mean--

14:54.560 --> 14:57.521
Yep. Willa Ward has the necklace.

15:12.786 --> 15:16.373
I just had the craziest dream.

15:17.541 --> 15:19.335
I don't think it was a dream.

15:19.418 --> 15:22.171
You mean, you actually rode a broomstick?

15:22.254 --> 15:24.256
And there's actually a talking rat?

15:24.340 --> 15:27.426
Are we actually losing our minds?

15:27.509 --> 15:30.179
Today, schoolgirls fly on brooms,

15:30.262 --> 15:33.432
and confide in
talking, jewelry-stealing rats

15:33.515 --> 15:34.892
on a very special episode of

15:35.476 --> 15:38.145
Adventures of a Middle Schooler Gone Mad.

15:40.439 --> 15:42.691
Definitely not your everyday necklace.

15:43.692 --> 15:45.402
What isn't your dad telling you?

15:46.695 --> 15:48.322
Let's go find out.

15:55.537 --> 15:57.915
Dad, you'll never believe
what happened last night.

15:57.998 --> 16:00.292
I woke up and
a talking rat had my necklace.

16:00.376 --> 16:04.046
-Uh-huh.
-Did you hear her say talking rat?

16:04.129 --> 16:06.632
We were chasing it with brooms,
and out of the blue,

16:06.715 --> 16:08.425
the brooms started flying everywhere.

16:08.509 --> 16:09.802
No way!

16:09.885 --> 16:13.430
Flying brooms and talking rats.
What a night.

16:13.514 --> 16:16.392
Yeah. Willa flew right out the window.

16:16.475 --> 16:18.310
And the rat said I look like Mom.

16:18.394 --> 16:21.814
Well, they're not wrong there.
Beautiful inside and out.

16:21.897 --> 16:25.734
You know, maybe I should speak with
this talking rat that knew your mom.

16:25.818 --> 16:27.319
We could swap stories.

16:27.403 --> 16:28.737
Isn't that crazy?

16:28.821 --> 16:30.447
Crazy, man!

16:30.990 --> 16:32.741
You don't believe us, do you?

16:32.825 --> 16:37.121
I believe that too much candy and
spooky stories make for wacky dreams.

16:37.705 --> 16:40.457
I ate five chocolate bars
before bed once, and I woke up

16:40.541 --> 16:42.960
convinced that I rode
a hippopotamus across the moon

16:43.043 --> 16:44.545
to meet the marshmallow queen

16:44.628 --> 16:47.297
so we could eat a rocket ship
made out of Jell-O

16:47.381 --> 16:48.924
and then play tic-tac-toe.

16:51.010 --> 16:52.261
-Dad.
-Yeah?

16:52.344 --> 16:53.637
This really happened.

16:53.721 --> 16:56.140
Hey, could you guys get me
one of those flying brooms?

16:56.223 --> 16:58.851
Could help me clean up the shop better.
Alright. Dig in.

16:58.934 --> 17:01.687
-Speaking of cleaning up…

17:05.733 --> 17:09.361
-Nothing like my necklace anywhere. Hm.

17:09.862 --> 17:13.449
Should we try that weird bookstore
with all the crystals and stuff?

17:14.742 --> 17:16.368
-Good idea.

17:18.078 --> 17:20.706
-Oh shoot. I'm late.
-To be continued?

17:21.415 --> 17:25.753
We'll get to the bottom of it.
Until then, just don't touch any brooms?

17:28.464 --> 17:29.798
-Bye.
-Bye.

17:42.436 --> 17:45.355
We only have
one month left till Halloween.

17:45.439 --> 17:47.691
Oh, what are you doing reading that book?

17:47.775 --> 17:51.361
I had a brainwave. What if
we had a summon-the-necklace spell?

17:51.445 --> 17:54.740
Uh, we probably would have
used it already if we did.

17:54.823 --> 17:56.658
I'm just thinking out loud.

17:56.742 --> 17:57.910
Still gonna look.

17:57.993 --> 18:00.662
Okay, will everyone
please just stop talking

18:00.746 --> 18:03.332
for one minute
so I can hear myself think?

18:03.415 --> 18:04.792
Thank you very much.

18:04.875 --> 18:07.503
I need to concentrate.
We need a plan.

18:07.586 --> 18:12.007
I suggest a potion to turn the girl
into a baby bunny.

18:12.091 --> 18:13.092
-Clever.

18:13.175 --> 18:14.384
Stupid.

18:14.468 --> 18:17.471
Then Claw could go catch her
and bring her up here.

18:17.554 --> 18:20.641
First we mix the fingernails
of a rabid mountain squirrel with the--

18:20.724 --> 18:23.977
Why don't we just invite her for tea?
Who doesn't like tea?

18:24.061 --> 18:27.022
-Um, 12-year-old girls.

18:27.106 --> 18:31.276
You might want to try a soda,
a juice box, mocha frappuccino…

18:31.360 --> 18:32.736
I mean, hello!

18:32.820 --> 18:37.241
How should I know? I detest children.
They make me break out in hives.

18:37.324 --> 18:39.159
Yeah, right? It's like…

18:39.243 --> 18:41.370
Alright, let's go with
the dumb tea party idea.

18:41.453 --> 18:43.956
-Yay. What should we wear?

18:44.039 --> 18:45.999
I don't know. Something gross?

18:51.922 --> 18:56.135
Cat amulets… No…

18:57.928 --> 18:59.680
Nothing.

19:00.639 --> 19:02.307
Maybe in here.

19:06.645 --> 19:08.772
Zilch.

19:09.982 --> 19:13.110
-Mom?

19:13.193 --> 19:16.572
This is a real mystery.

19:36.091 --> 19:38.177
Special delivery for Miss Willa Ward.

19:41.054 --> 19:42.764
Another talking animal?

19:43.682 --> 19:46.977
-How do you know who I am?

19:52.232 --> 19:54.318
-Wow.

20:04.119 --> 20:09.833
"Dear Willa Ward. We've just moved back
in town after being away for some time."

20:09.917 --> 20:11.543
"We knew your mother well,

20:11.627 --> 20:16.506
and would love to tell you
all about her and her magical necklace."

20:16.590 --> 20:19.176
"Please join us
after school for tea and treats."

20:19.259 --> 20:21.178
"With love, Wanda and Wilma."

20:21.261 --> 20:26.767
"P.S. We live in the old
house at the top of the hill…"

20:38.362 --> 20:41.949
Oh, good morning, Kingsley Jenkins.
Nice to see your face.

20:42.532 --> 20:47.079
Oh! Good morning, Willa Ward.
Welcome to class.

20:47.162 --> 20:50.082
-A new day of adventure.
-Morning, Ms. Juniper.

20:51.625 --> 20:52.542
Um…

20:53.627 --> 20:55.212
May I ask…

20:56.338 --> 20:58.340
Where did you get that necklace?

20:58.423 --> 20:59.341
Why?

20:59.424 --> 21:02.636
Oh, no reason exactly.
Just curious.

21:03.220 --> 21:04.513
It was my mom's.

21:04.596 --> 21:06.598
-Oh.

21:08.809 --> 21:09.851
Great! Good chat.

21:10.560 --> 21:11.395
Okay.

21:12.729 --> 21:13.689
Nice necklace!

21:13.772 --> 21:16.024
You getting ready for Halloween?

21:16.108 --> 21:17.484
Going as…

21:17.567 --> 21:19.236
a fashion disaster?

21:19.319 --> 21:20.737
Oh, wait.

21:20.821 --> 21:22.739
I guess that wouldn't be a costume.

21:22.823 --> 21:27.786
Since jealousy is actually a compliment,
Blaine, I'm simply going to say thank you.

21:27.869 --> 21:29.162
I love it too!

21:31.623 --> 21:32.958
Secret stair spot.

21:33.041 --> 21:35.544
Meeting at lunch. Super important.

21:41.925 --> 21:43.927
Where is it?

22:01.194 --> 22:03.864
"Please join us
after school for tea and treats."

22:03.947 --> 22:06.158
"With love, Wanda and Wilma."

22:07.034 --> 22:07.993
-What?
-What?

22:08.076 --> 22:10.329
I know. What?

22:10.412 --> 22:11.246
Are you going?

22:11.330 --> 22:14.166
Of course she is. You're going, right?

22:14.249 --> 22:18.837
Of course I am. They said they know
about my mom, and this necklace.

22:18.920 --> 22:23.050
You're brave to go up there alone.
You know, I would never go up there.

22:23.133 --> 22:25.218
You do know the stories, right?

22:25.302 --> 22:28.847
-That's why I'm not going alone.
-Who are you going with?

22:30.640 --> 22:35.979
I'll pack some snacks. Nothing too sugary.
The last 24 hours have been weird enough.

22:36.063 --> 22:37.147
Definitely.

22:46.073 --> 22:48.658
Remember, I have to be home
by dinner to babysit Sawyer.

22:48.742 --> 22:51.578
It shouldn't take too long.
It's just tea, right?

22:52.162 --> 22:53.455
Come on, let's do this.

22:53.538 --> 22:54.372
Do what?

22:54.873 --> 22:56.249
-Nothing.
-Nobody.

22:56.333 --> 22:57.709
Hey, Wyatt.

22:57.793 --> 22:59.753
You guys up to something exciting?

22:59.836 --> 23:01.713
No. Totally boring.

23:01.797 --> 23:03.298
Boring.

23:03.381 --> 23:06.468
Speak for yourself, Lucy.
I'd call it intriguing.

23:07.469 --> 23:08.470
-I mean--
-Be quiet.

23:08.553 --> 23:11.348
Yep. Boring. So boring.

23:11.431 --> 23:15.560
Ugh, bummer. I was looking for
something fun to do after school today.

23:16.561 --> 23:17.562
See ya.

23:18.146 --> 23:20.482
A talking crow is so not boring.

23:26.696 --> 23:28.365
Hey, Willa. What are you doing here?

23:28.448 --> 23:31.368
Hey, Dad. Just wanted to let you know
I'm going to be late today.

23:31.451 --> 23:34.704
-I'm going to tea with, um, uh--
-Oh, okay, Willa.

23:34.788 --> 23:37.499
Hey, little guy.
I'll see you at dinner, right?

23:37.582 --> 23:41.795
-Okay, bye.
-Don't worry, they're just eyeballs.

24:02.858 --> 24:03.692
Ready?

24:08.405 --> 24:11.700
Why are we taking
the spookiest possible route to get there?

24:11.783 --> 24:16.037
You know, the legend says
these woods are the Haunted Hills,

24:16.121 --> 24:19.374
cursed by the three witches
of Winding Way themselves.

24:19.916 --> 24:24.087
I heard that witches have lived
in that old house for centuries.

24:24.171 --> 24:26.715
Well, it's a good thing
we're brave, right?

24:28.049 --> 24:30.218
Come on. None of that is real.

24:30.302 --> 24:34.306
-Besides, this isn't that spooky.
-Yeah.

24:39.060 --> 24:41.605
They're probably just old ladies

24:41.688 --> 24:44.983
who happen to live
in a really creepy old house.

24:46.526 --> 24:49.946
Just that right there sounded like
the setup for a spooky movie.

24:50.030 --> 24:53.783
Yeah. What could go wrong?

24:54.743 --> 24:56.703
Famous last words.

25:07.297 --> 25:09.799
Defs the beginning
of a spooky movie.

25:10.342 --> 25:12.219
Well, no time like the present.

25:24.105 --> 25:26.358
-Hello?

25:26.441 --> 25:28.026
Hello?

25:29.819 --> 25:31.404
Is anyone home?

25:32.822 --> 25:36.952
I hope you don't mind.
I brought my friends.

25:39.329 --> 25:43.416
-Willa! So nice to see you again.

25:44.793 --> 25:45.835
Again?

25:45.919 --> 25:48.171
We knew you when you were just a baby.

25:48.255 --> 25:54.594
Oh, such a cute baby, with the skin,
and the teeth, and the hairs, and things.

25:54.678 --> 25:55.887
And Lucy, Scout.

25:57.264 --> 25:58.390
-Welcome.

25:58.473 --> 26:00.016
How did you know…?

26:00.100 --> 26:03.853
Oh, just a simple seeing spell,
nothing fancy.

26:03.937 --> 26:06.690
-Spell?
-Ix-nay on the agic-may.

26:07.274 --> 26:09.317
Please, sit down.

26:15.824 --> 26:18.910
So, you knew my mom?

26:18.994 --> 26:21.496
Oh! Knew her?

26:21.579 --> 26:23.123
Knew her?

26:23.206 --> 26:25.041
She was, uh, we were like…

26:25.834 --> 26:28.586
That. We were best friends.
We were just real close.

26:28.670 --> 26:32.590
-You couldn't keep the three of us apart.

26:32.674 --> 26:36.428
Well, until Neil--

26:37.679 --> 26:40.974
Until nothing.
Until nothing.

26:41.057 --> 26:43.351
She was a real sweetheart,
you know, heart of gold.

26:43.435 --> 26:45.437
Don't be shy.

26:51.276 --> 26:54.279
Well,
this isn't much of a tea party, is it?

26:54.362 --> 26:56.614
Kind of a stinker, eh?

26:56.698 --> 26:57.866
Kidding.

26:57.949 --> 27:00.452
No, because there are no treats,
and, um, no tea.

27:00.535 --> 27:03.663
But I can change that,
so I'm going to. Alright?

27:03.747 --> 27:05.707
-Poof!
-Whoa!

27:05.790 --> 27:07.500
-Amazing.

27:07.584 --> 27:08.960
What are you doing?

27:09.044 --> 27:13.173
You know that
children love candy, so just play along.

27:14.007 --> 27:15.967
-Whoa!

27:16.051 --> 27:18.595
-What's happening?
-Now what is happening?

27:19.846 --> 27:22.265
-Isn't this fun?

27:22.349 --> 27:23.850
So much--

27:23.933 --> 27:25.810
So much fun.

27:25.894 --> 27:31.274
Now what is your favorite treat
in the whole wide world?

27:31.358 --> 27:32.192
Cotton candy.

27:33.026 --> 27:34.819
Cotton candy.

27:35.362 --> 27:36.196
Yum.

27:38.114 --> 27:40.200
-Whoa.

27:43.244 --> 27:47.540
Edible chair? What?
This might be the best day of my life.

27:47.624 --> 27:52.170
Lucy, what would you
like to have at tea for three?

27:52.962 --> 27:56.299
Well, I've always dreamed
of it raining chocolate.

27:57.175 --> 28:00.220
-Oh, no.

28:02.138 --> 28:04.224
-Whoa!

28:06.309 --> 28:07.310
Delicious!

28:10.355 --> 28:12.357
-Delicious!
-Whoa!

28:20.407 --> 28:23.118
-Wow!

28:23.201 --> 28:25.578
-Ugh.

28:27.414 --> 28:29.916
-Urgh.

28:32.419 --> 28:35.338
Now Willa, what about you, my dear?

28:35.422 --> 28:36.840
I want to know about my mom,

28:36.923 --> 28:41.386
so maybe we could have
more talk, less treats.

28:41.469 --> 28:44.389
-Willa, are you crazy?
-Speak for yourself.

28:44.472 --> 28:47.892
She's here. What are we waiting for?

28:47.976 --> 28:50.979
Let's get that thing off her.

28:51.062 --> 28:56.234
Well, um, you know, maybe we should just
give them a moment to enjoy the tea party,

28:56.317 --> 28:57.152
for-for a moment.

28:59.404 --> 29:02.073
Fink, Sneak, shut up!

29:02.699 --> 29:05.034
Wait a second.
That's that rat from last night.

29:06.369 --> 29:10.081
Uh, I think we should go.

29:10.165 --> 29:12.417
-No.

29:14.127 --> 29:18.256
Let's cut to the chase, shall we?

29:18.339 --> 29:20.008
We want your necklace.

29:20.925 --> 29:24.888
I know it would be nice for you to have
it, but what good is it to you, really?

29:24.971 --> 29:27.474
I mean, whereas to us,
getting it back would be,

29:27.557 --> 29:29.392
I don't know, Wilma, what would you say?

29:29.476 --> 29:33.271
Like, um, magnificently
splendorifically terrifical?

29:33.354 --> 29:35.648
-Yes, I'd say exactly that.
-Mm-hm.

29:36.232 --> 29:40.028
No. It was my mom's
and she wanted me to have it.

29:40.945 --> 29:44.616
You invited me here to tell me about her,
and I haven't heard one thing.

29:44.699 --> 29:46.618
So, we're leaving.

29:50.705 --> 29:52.540
Uh, no you're not.

29:52.624 --> 29:53.458
Sneak.

29:55.210 --> 29:58.880
Aw, that's a shame,
because there was an easy way to do this,

29:58.963 --> 30:01.633
and now,
what do you know, there's a hard way.

30:01.716 --> 30:04.511
I mean, we didn't want to
have to play the witch card,

30:04.594 --> 30:07.222
but you've kind of forced our hands.

30:09.641 --> 30:12.268
-Witches!

30:12.352 --> 30:14.437
See? I told you those stories are true.

30:14.521 --> 30:17.148
You want to know something about your mom?

30:18.024 --> 30:19.734
She was too trusting.

30:20.610 --> 30:24.113
Just. Like. You.

30:26.950 --> 30:28.576
-Over here!

30:33.206 --> 30:38.169
-Oh, no. Um, here. Hide.
-It's time! Witches coming for ya!

30:38.253 --> 30:40.880
-Whoa!

30:40.964 --> 30:41.965
Oh, girls?

30:42.048 --> 30:44.217
We just want to talk to you.

30:46.636 --> 30:48.346
They're coming.

30:48.429 --> 30:49.889
Hide. In here.

30:53.351 --> 30:57.230
-Girls! Where did you go?

30:57.313 --> 31:00.817
-You can run, but you can't hide.

31:04.445 --> 31:05.488
This way.

31:08.408 --> 31:10.994
Some kind of potion room.

31:12.871 --> 31:16.207
I'm calling my mom.
I don't care if I get grounded--

31:17.792 --> 31:19.460
Forever. There's no signal.

31:21.754 --> 31:24.173
Lucy, your face feels
more bony than usual.

31:24.257 --> 31:26.843
-You're not touching my face, Scout.
-Sure I am.

31:26.926 --> 31:30.263
That's your cheek, and now
I'm sticking my finger into your eye--

31:30.763 --> 31:32.056
Into your eye?!

31:37.854 --> 31:39.564
-Oh, girls?
-Oh no.

31:39.647 --> 31:41.691
Find a potion!

31:41.774 --> 31:43.318
-Do something!

31:43.401 --> 31:45.445
Nope. Upside down potion.

31:47.947 --> 31:49.365
Flying potion.

31:51.284 --> 31:53.036
Hiding potion! Aha!

31:55.705 --> 31:56.748
Here.

31:58.416 --> 32:00.001
Uh…

32:00.627 --> 32:04.339
"When ye wish to hide
From the troubles on the outside

32:04.422 --> 32:08.927
Drink this potion with open mind
And ye shall be the… feline kind?"

32:09.010 --> 32:10.970
Wait. Does that mean…?

32:11.054 --> 32:12.722
-Oh no.

32:25.193 --> 32:26.986
-You're--
-I have paws.

32:27.070 --> 32:28.488
Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no.

32:30.114 --> 32:32.200
And a tail!

32:32.283 --> 32:34.035
Yoo-hoo! Girls.

32:34.619 --> 32:35.536
Run!

32:35.620 --> 32:39.290
Run? I have to learn to walk
with four legs before I can run!

32:39.374 --> 32:41.125
I won't let them get away.

32:42.168 --> 32:46.714
-Where did they get to now?
-Sure are slimy little things.

32:46.798 --> 32:50.218
-Quick. Under here.

32:50.301 --> 32:52.345
I've looked everywhere. They're gone.

32:52.428 --> 32:55.974
And I looked everywhere you looked
right after you did,

32:56.057 --> 32:57.642
just to be sure.

33:01.521 --> 33:05.233
You know how cats can
fit into the smallest places?

33:05.316 --> 33:09.195
You want us to go in there?
Look at the size of that spider.

33:09.278 --> 33:12.281
I'll stay here and meet my fate,
thank you very much.

33:12.365 --> 33:14.242
Shoo, you big, hairy spider.

33:14.325 --> 33:15.660
We're coming in.

33:15.743 --> 33:18.830
Come on, Lucy.
We don't have time to be scared.

33:19.664 --> 33:21.541
Ew…

33:21.624 --> 33:24.585
Where are they?

33:28.131 --> 33:29.215
A tail.

33:29.298 --> 33:32.218
A tail. That means
they've gotten into the hiding potion.

33:32.301 --> 33:34.387
-We need to go outside! We need Claw!

33:34.470 --> 33:36.014
-Claw!
-Claw!

33:36.097 --> 33:39.976
We have to keep moving.
We cannot be scaredy cats.

33:40.059 --> 33:42.020
I am a scaredy cat, though.

33:48.693 --> 33:49.527
Claw!

33:49.610 --> 33:52.739
-Oh, hey! How's the party going?
-They snuck out in the drain.

33:52.822 --> 33:54.949
Let us know immediately
if you see them, okay?

33:55.033 --> 33:57.910
-Uh… sure?
-Do not let them get away.

33:58.453 --> 34:00.496
As the crow flies,
they can't have gone far.

34:00.580 --> 34:03.332
You're a crow, so you should know.
Okay, stop looking at me.

34:03.416 --> 34:04.667
-Fly!

34:06.044 --> 34:07.837
-Yes. Wilma?
-Yes?

34:08.337 --> 34:10.006
Warm up the cauldron.

34:10.089 --> 34:11.090
Now?

34:11.716 --> 34:13.051
Yes, Wilma, now.

34:25.480 --> 34:27.482
Cat respect meter just went way up.

34:27.565 --> 34:29.817
That was so claustrophobic.

34:29.901 --> 34:32.320
And filthy. Ew.

34:32.403 --> 34:36.491
-Here, kitties, kitties, kitties!

34:40.119 --> 34:43.372
Well, I spy with
my little crow eye…

34:43.456 --> 34:44.707
It's that creepy crow!

34:44.791 --> 34:47.543
Shoo! Go away! Leave us alone!

34:47.627 --> 34:50.088
Not until you hand over the amulet.

34:50.755 --> 34:51.756
Run!

34:51.839 --> 34:54.133
-Yes, yes, yes…

34:54.217 --> 34:55.760
Oh yes, oh yes!

34:55.843 --> 34:59.347
Claw's got them. Wilma! Claw's got them!

34:59.847 --> 35:00.723
We got 'em!

35:02.100 --> 35:07.230
Fog and bog and city smog
And nice little families out for a jog

35:07.313 --> 35:12.360
Envelop the children who are now cats
And, oh, they'll be scared like, like rats

35:12.443 --> 35:14.487
Okay? Mm-hm. Ooh.

35:15.988 --> 35:18.032
Meow!
It's foggy, I can't see.

35:18.116 --> 35:20.952
It's really working,
Wilma, it's working!

35:26.290 --> 35:27.708
What is this place?

35:28.251 --> 35:31.212
Super creepy, that's what.

35:31.295 --> 35:33.548
In case we don't make it back,
I just want to say

35:33.631 --> 35:36.884
that I was 100% right
about the witches this whole time.

35:36.968 --> 35:39.262
Where's all this fog coming from?

35:39.887 --> 35:41.806
I can't see my paws in front of my face!

35:41.889 --> 35:43.933
This is so not fun anymore.

35:44.517 --> 35:48.521
Honestly, it really hasn't been fun
since the candy part,

35:49.272 --> 35:51.858
and even that felt a tad unsanitary.

35:51.941 --> 35:53.734
-Hello, girls.

35:58.406 --> 35:59.907
Nice work, Claw.

35:59.991 --> 36:03.202
An extra portion of kitten stew
just for you!

36:03.286 --> 36:06.330
Aha! Hello, kitten stew.

36:06.414 --> 36:08.833
One thing you three might have overlooked.

36:08.916 --> 36:11.085
Witches love eating cat stew!

36:11.169 --> 36:13.838
Especially on a stormy night.

36:13.921 --> 36:16.841
Eat someone else then,
because we're out of here.

36:16.924 --> 36:19.427
-Run!
-I am not a snack.

36:19.510 --> 36:22.930
I forgot how slippery cats are.

36:23.014 --> 36:25.141
But not how tasty.

36:27.059 --> 36:29.103
-Whoo!
-You go that way.

36:36.235 --> 36:39.113
-Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no.

36:39.614 --> 36:42.742
Where could they be?

36:42.825 --> 36:44.994
Don't move a whisker.

36:45.077 --> 36:48.080
Oh, no, guys. I have to…

36:48.748 --> 36:51.250
-Please don't sneeze.

36:51.834 --> 36:54.545
-Please, please hold it in.

36:54.629 --> 36:56.380
Hold it in.

36:59.383 --> 37:00.426
-Bless you.
-Thanks.

37:00.509 --> 37:03.012
-We need to get out of here.
-Now's our chance.

37:03.095 --> 37:04.138
Lucy, wait!

37:05.181 --> 37:07.516
Boo.

37:09.936 --> 37:12.230
Not so fast this time.

37:12.313 --> 37:16.025
Now the hiding's said and done
Return the form that they came from

37:17.568 --> 37:19.946
We're human again. We're human!

37:20.029 --> 37:21.155
-Hey, hi.
-Yes!

37:21.239 --> 37:23.199
Still dangerous witches, not so happy.

37:23.282 --> 37:26.285
Looks like you girls have been rooted out.

37:28.621 --> 37:30.998
And it's going to be
a lot harder for you to escape

37:31.082 --> 37:34.168
now that you're just
"pesky little girls" and not cats.

37:34.252 --> 37:37.004
Oh, I have an idea.
Why don't we call this whole thing off,

37:37.088 --> 37:40.341
and you just, I don't know,
hand over the necklace.

37:40.424 --> 37:41.801
Just grab it.

37:41.884 --> 37:45.221
You know as well as I do,
it needs to be given, not taken.

37:45.304 --> 37:49.225
Well, in that case,
hand over the amulet. Now!

37:49.308 --> 37:50.142
No!

37:50.643 --> 37:53.312
My mom would never want it
in the hands of you bad witches.

37:53.396 --> 37:54.605
Ooh.

37:54.689 --> 37:57.942
-I'm gonna get my dad and he'll--

37:58.025 --> 38:01.487
Did you hear that, Wilma?
She's going to get "Neil" to come help.

38:01.570 --> 38:04.115
-Neil!

38:04.198 --> 38:06.784
My mom was right.
Chocolate alleviates stress.

38:06.867 --> 38:08.703
Good thing I loaded up at the tea party.

38:08.786 --> 38:11.706
Seriously? You're eating candy right now?

38:11.789 --> 38:13.749
Candy?

38:16.252 --> 38:17.086
The candy!

38:18.421 --> 38:20.381
They can't stand candy. Literally!

38:23.384 --> 38:24.427
Take that!

38:27.972 --> 38:29.557
Let's get out of here, fast.

38:29.640 --> 38:32.893
-Ooh! Oh no. Burning!

38:33.894 --> 38:36.981
-Stop!

38:40.526 --> 38:41.444
We made it.

38:42.028 --> 38:45.281
-Oh my goodness.
-Hey! Alright, I got a signal!

38:45.364 --> 38:46.198
Oh, good.

38:46.782 --> 38:49.118
Okay, I am so grounded.

38:49.785 --> 38:52.204
So much for those stories
being made up, huh, Scout?

38:52.288 --> 38:55.624
I mean, no 11-year-old
really believes in witches.

38:55.708 --> 38:57.501
How was I supposed to know?

38:59.879 --> 39:05.051
I have a feeling that's not the last
we'll be seeing of those two.

39:05.134 --> 39:09.347
As scary as tonight was,
it was also pretty cool to be a cat.

39:09.430 --> 39:11.515
-Think we can do it again?

39:11.599 --> 39:13.184
Seriously?

39:13.768 --> 39:15.770
-Too soon?
-Yes!

39:15.853 --> 39:20.274
And there's no way I'm going back into
that house to get more potion. Except…

39:21.108 --> 39:24.528
Wait a second.
I forgot to put it back on the shelf.

39:25.988 --> 39:29.033
I think seventh grade
just got a lot more interesting.

39:30.701 --> 39:35.164
Hey, guys? Thanks for being such
great friends today and sticking by me.

39:36.749 --> 39:39.543
You guys are like
the sisters I never had.

39:42.630 --> 39:47.301
The Sisters
of Winding Way! Whoo…

39:47.385 --> 39:50.179
-Wisters!

39:50.763 --> 39:54.934
The Wisters of Winding Way!

39:57.019 --> 39:59.814
-The Wisters!
-Come on.

40:08.114 --> 40:09.115
Heyo.

40:09.698 --> 40:10.533
Dad!

40:11.158 --> 40:14.203
What would you say if I told you
I got chased by witches today

40:14.286 --> 40:16.539
and turned into a cat?

40:16.622 --> 40:19.125
Well I would say, sweetheart,

40:19.208 --> 40:22.336
you don't have to make up stories
to get my attention.

40:22.878 --> 40:24.922
You always have my attention.

40:25.506 --> 40:27.591
Thought it would be something like that.

40:27.675 --> 40:30.469
-Do you know where Mom got this?

40:31.429 --> 40:34.014
No. She just always had it,
ever since I knew her.

40:35.057 --> 40:39.061
She used to say she was a different person
before she and I met and we had you.

40:39.770 --> 40:43.816
Maybe she got it from one of the
witches of Winding Way.

40:47.987 --> 40:48.988
Bedtime.

40:49.864 --> 40:51.240
You want the lights on or off?

40:51.740 --> 40:52.575
On.

40:52.658 --> 40:54.827
Okay. Love you, kiddo.

41:06.005 --> 41:08.716
-Whoa.

41:16.223 --> 41:17.057
What?

41:21.812 --> 41:22.938
"Dear Willa."

41:23.606 --> 41:27.067
"If you're reading this,
that means you have my necklace,

41:27.902 --> 41:31.489
and I think you're probably wondering
if I was a witch."

41:32.823 --> 41:33.949
"I was."

41:34.492 --> 41:36.452
I was a witch, Willa.

41:38.954 --> 41:41.665
And if I know my curious…

41:43.125 --> 41:46.504
pure-hearted, beautiful baby girl…

41:49.548 --> 41:51.467
…I know what you're thinking.

41:52.301 --> 41:56.847
"How could my mom be a witch,
and does this make me a witch too?"

41:57.431 --> 41:59.767
Just because you are mine…

42:00.267 --> 42:02.478
"…doesn't make you a witch."

42:02.561 --> 42:06.690
"Believing in magic does,
and you can be a witch."

42:06.774 --> 42:08.317
A good witch,

42:09.193 --> 42:13.572
if you choose to believe in
the values of courage,

42:13.656 --> 42:16.242
kindness, and wisdom.

42:16.825 --> 42:19.495
"Magic can be used for bad things,

42:19.578 --> 42:23.374
but it can also be used
for very, very good things."

42:24.917 --> 42:26.502
You taught me that, Willa.

42:29.964 --> 42:34.510
And now that you have my necklace,
you have that choice.

42:43.686 --> 42:47.565
There is something very important
you must do, though.

42:48.566 --> 42:52.069
"In order to harness
the power of the amulet,

42:52.152 --> 42:54.196
and keep yourself safe…"

42:54.697 --> 42:57.032
…you will need my secret witch book.

42:58.534 --> 43:01.537
I hid it for you
in case this day ever came.

43:02.246 --> 43:05.374
There will be obstacles
along the way to finding it…

43:05.457 --> 43:08.085
"…to make sure
it ends up in the right hands."

43:08.168 --> 43:09.712
Your hands.

43:12.464 --> 43:13.632
I love you…

43:15.134 --> 43:16.969
with all that I am.

43:17.553 --> 43:19.513
"And I am always with you."

43:19.597 --> 43:20.931
Closer than you know.

43:22.308 --> 43:24.727
"Take good care of Dad."

43:25.561 --> 43:27.146
You are my heart.

43:27.896 --> 43:28.731
"Mom."

43:44.788 --> 43:46.123
Whoa.

43:55.049 --> 43:56.258
Wow.
