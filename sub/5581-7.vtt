00:43.960 --> 00:45.150
Tell me the worst, Billy.

00:45.200 --> 00:48.070
I'm afraid Mr Rogers beat you
by three-and-a-half seconds.

00:48.120 --> 00:51.830
Take it like a man, Henry. Can I
help it if I am your superior?

00:51.880 --> 00:54.150
You want a drink?

00:54.200 --> 00:57.960
- Why not?
- See you there. Thanks, Billy.

00:59.920 --> 01:02.710
- Well, this is very nice.
- What is?

01:02.760 --> 01:05.670
Mary's beau, Henry
Talbot, has invited us all

01:05.720 --> 01:07.750
to watch him drive at
Brooklands next week.

01:07.800 --> 01:10.910
- He's just sucking up.
- Mama won't ever let you go.

01:10.960 --> 01:13.510
- I don't see why not.
- Because you're still convalescing.

01:13.560 --> 01:16.030
I only want to watch the
race, not drive in it.

01:16.080 --> 01:18.950
It's a long way, and it won't
last much more than ten minutes.

01:19.000 --> 01:21.470
He told me he's inviting Bertie Pelham.

01:21.520 --> 01:23.310
- Oh.
- What about you, Mary?

01:23.360 --> 01:27.040
I think I've talked myself into it,
although I'm sure I'll be sorry.

01:28.400 --> 01:30.830
Just think! It's finished
and open for business.

01:30.880 --> 01:33.110
You are the owner of a
bed-and-breakfast hotel.

01:33.160 --> 01:35.870
- What have you had done?
- I turned a bedroom into a bathroom

01:35.920 --> 01:38.350
- and I've installed an inside privy.
- Think of that.

01:38.400 --> 01:41.310
It leaves me two bedrooms to let,
and one for my niece to run it.

01:41.360 --> 01:44.310
- Which is yours when the time comes.
- Mmm, when the time comes.

01:44.360 --> 01:47.350
All you need now are some clients
and that will happen soon enough.

01:47.400 --> 01:49.470
- How's life for the newly-weds?
- Fine.

01:49.520 --> 01:52.950
Only, Mr Carson wants to
dine at the cottage again.

01:53.000 --> 01:55.750
No need to sound so gloomy.
I can rustle up something.

01:55.800 --> 01:57.350
Whatever you do rustle up,

01:57.400 --> 02:00.030
I won't cook it right, or
the plates will be cold,

02:00.080 --> 02:03.110
- or the dressing will be wrong.
- Does he appreciate all you do?

02:03.160 --> 02:05.430
- Does any man?
- Ooh, Daisy.

02:06.200 --> 02:08.669
Mr Dawes has been given a
date by the examining board.

02:08.720 --> 02:10.470
- Blimey, when is it?
- The 20th.

02:10.520 --> 02:11.950
Oh, my God!

02:12.000 --> 02:14.630
I will thank you not to take
the name of the Lord in vain.

02:14.680 --> 02:18.180
I hope it's not in vain! I
need all the help I can get!

02:18.960 --> 02:22.670
- Do you enjoy weddings?
- Yes. But I'm not going to that one.

02:22.720 --> 02:26.030
I'd feel like the wicked fairy at
the christening of Sleeping Beauty.

02:26.080 --> 02:29.990
Why would Larry Grey want you to
be there? I mean, you of all people.

02:30.040 --> 02:33.030
I'm sure he doesn't. Dickie
must've persuaded them to ask me.

02:33.080 --> 02:36.630
I doubt that. He wouldn't want
to subject you to more insults.

02:36.680 --> 02:38.150
Well, who then?

02:38.200 --> 02:41.350
I'd say this is the
work of Miss Cruikshank.

02:41.400 --> 02:45.720
She's the one always
making a show of friendship.

02:47.320 --> 02:51.390
Why don't I pay a call on her?
See if I can winkle out the truth.

02:51.440 --> 02:54.870
- I'm sorry I showed it to you now.
- Oh, don't be, don't be.

02:54.920 --> 02:57.790
Are things going well
in my former kingdom?

02:58.320 --> 03:01.710
Cora is settling in. I
know it must feel awkward.

03:01.760 --> 03:05.310
Oh, no. I'm yesterday, she's
tomorrow. That's the way it is.

03:05.360 --> 03:07.350
- You must be feeling very hurt.
- Well,

03:07.400 --> 03:09.790
the fact is, I might as well be honest.

03:09.840 --> 03:12.190
I am angry at the way I have been treated.

03:12.240 --> 03:13.470
I don't blame you.

03:13.520 --> 03:17.270
While angry, I say things some
people find hard to forgive.

03:17.320 --> 03:19.950
So, I have decided to go away.

03:20.000 --> 03:23.440
I'd rather vent my rage
on the desert air...

03:25.040 --> 03:27.870
.. and return when I've
regained control of my tongue.

03:27.920 --> 03:30.310
Your self-knowledge is
an example to us all.

03:30.360 --> 03:32.110
You don't think I'm wrong?

03:32.160 --> 03:34.590
The last thing you need
at this stage in your life

03:34.640 --> 03:36.870
is to quarrel with your
son and daughter-in-law.

03:36.920 --> 03:41.470
Precisely. But don't fear. I'll call
on Miss Cruikshank before I leave.

03:41.520 --> 03:43.470
I suspect she's quite a tough nut.

03:43.520 --> 03:46.560
And I'm quite a tough nutcracker.

03:51.200 --> 03:54.390
How's Mr Mason getting on? I'm
always ready if he needs any help.

03:54.440 --> 03:57.350
I'm going down there this afternoon,
I'll tell him you said so.

03:57.400 --> 03:59.870
I am trying to find a
position, Mr Carson, honestly.

03:59.920 --> 04:05.350
I don't say you're not, but it doesn't seem
quite fair on His Lordship to string it out.

04:05.400 --> 04:06.950
Does that mean I'm sacked?

04:07.000 --> 04:10.110
It means I shall be pleased
when we learn the identity

04:10.160 --> 04:12.560
of your next employer, Mr Barrow.

04:17.680 --> 04:20.950
We'd stay with Rosamund, drive
to the track, have lunch,

04:21.000 --> 04:23.270
see some racing and come
home the following day.

04:23.320 --> 04:25.830
It's so unnecessary in your state.

04:25.880 --> 04:28.750
But I'm not in a state. Unless
it's a state of boredom.

04:28.800 --> 04:30.390
Please let me.

04:30.440 --> 04:34.030
- It's not my decision.
- If you mean that, then we're going.

04:34.080 --> 04:36.190
- Edith?
- Oh, I'm in if Bertie's coming.

04:36.240 --> 04:37.350
It's a long way for him.

04:37.400 --> 04:39.870
Maybe there's something
else for him to do in London.

04:39.920 --> 04:42.270
Isn't it enough that
it's a chance to see you?

04:42.320 --> 04:44.590
Would it annoy you if it were?

04:53.840 --> 04:56.750
I'm sorry if Mr Carson
spoke harshly just now.

04:56.800 --> 04:58.230
He doesn't mean to be unkind.

04:58.280 --> 05:00.390
But it worries him when a plan is delayed.

05:00.440 --> 05:02.640
The plan being my departure.

05:10.000 --> 05:13.040
You just haven't found the
right person yet, Mr Barrow.

05:14.200 --> 05:17.350
But I'm sure there are friends
out there waiting for you,

05:17.400 --> 05:21.870
and a new job in a new house
may help you to find them.

05:21.920 --> 05:24.120
Well, you see, Mrs Hughes,...

05:25.360 --> 05:31.000
.. this is the first place I've found
where I've laid down some roots.

05:57.720 --> 06:00.710
I'm terribly sorry, Lady Grantham.
No-one told me you were coming

06:00.760 --> 06:04.390
- and I'm afraid Lord Merton's out.
- It's you I've come to see.

06:04.440 --> 06:06.110
How flattering.

06:06.960 --> 06:09.960
- May I offer you anything?
- Only your attention.

06:11.200 --> 06:12.940
Shall I sit here?

06:14.640 --> 06:19.310
Now, Mrs Crawley tells me
that you paid her a visit

06:19.360 --> 06:22.910
when you first came, that
you were amazingly friendly.

06:22.960 --> 06:26.590
- Well, I hope I'm always friendly.
- Nobody's always friendly.

06:26.640 --> 06:29.830
And now you have invited
her to your wedding,

06:29.880 --> 06:31.950
which has taken her by surprise.

06:32.000 --> 06:35.990
You mean Larry and Mrs Crawley have
not seen eye to eye in the past.

06:36.040 --> 06:39.670
Larry Grey has spoken to
Mrs Crawley in a manner

06:39.720 --> 06:43.070
that in any other century would
have resulted in him being

06:43.120 --> 06:44.590
called out and shot.

06:44.640 --> 06:47.550
I can't believe it was as bad as that.

06:47.600 --> 06:50.630
Then you are misinformed.
But I want to know this.

06:50.680 --> 06:56.150
Why encourage Mrs Crawley when your
fiance detests the mere idea of her?

06:56.200 --> 06:59.710
I still dispute that, but I would say

06:59.760 --> 07:03.710
that Larry had perhaps not
quite thought matters through.

07:03.760 --> 07:07.390
- Meaning?
- Only that his father is old,

07:07.440 --> 07:11.350
and alone, and in need of...

07:11.400 --> 07:13.070
In need of care?

07:14.160 --> 07:16.350
Which you are not prepared to give.

07:16.400 --> 07:19.350
I would've said a companion.

07:19.400 --> 07:21.800
Which you are not prepared to be.

07:22.240 --> 07:27.230
And what of this house? Will you
surrender it to be free of him?

07:27.280 --> 07:30.750
She won't want to live at
Cavenham after Lord Merton's death.

07:30.800 --> 07:33.430
It would be lonely for a woman like her.

07:33.480 --> 07:37.550
But, by heaven, I bet it won't be
too lonely for a woman like you.

07:37.600 --> 07:41.390
I expect they'll have to drag you
out as you break your fingernails

07:41.440 --> 07:43.580
catching at the door case.

07:44.320 --> 07:46.630
So, there we have it.

07:46.680 --> 07:52.560
You want a free nurse to take her
tiresome old man off your hands.

07:55.040 --> 07:57.310
You're a cruel, little Miss, aren't you?

07:57.360 --> 08:02.710
I'd feel sorry for Larry, if
I didn't dislike him so much.

08:02.760 --> 08:07.270
I shall forget you said
that, but you should go now.

08:07.320 --> 08:10.870
Much more, and we may
feel awkward when we meet.

08:10.920 --> 08:14.620
- Which we are bound to do.
- I think not, Miss Cruikshank.

08:14.840 --> 08:17.280
Not if I see you first.

08:18.080 --> 08:20.030
Er, as you may have gathered,

08:20.080 --> 08:22.470
the family will be away
for three days next week,

08:22.520 --> 08:25.270
so if any of you feel
you're owed some time off,

08:25.320 --> 08:29.670
perhaps you could take it then.
Er, but clear it with me first.

08:29.720 --> 08:32.669
I've put in the advertisement.
It'll be out in the morning.

08:32.720 --> 08:36.150
- So, now you just have to be patient.
- What's this?

08:36.200 --> 08:39.909
Mrs Patmore is ready for her first
visitors to the guest house.

08:39.960 --> 08:42.350
- That was quick.
- Yeah, just what I said.

08:42.400 --> 08:44.950
- I've got butterflies.
- Oh, don't be silly.

08:45.000 --> 08:47.550
I'll go over to check it
all when they're in London.

08:47.600 --> 08:49.630
Oh, I'll come with you if you like.

08:49.680 --> 08:53.230
Everyone has something to do
on their free days, except me.

08:53.280 --> 08:55.830
We know what you've got to do, Mr Barrow.

08:55.880 --> 08:57.840
Yes, Mr Carson.

09:05.200 --> 09:08.840
Well! If that doesn't
just take the biscuit.

09:10.480 --> 09:12.630
Are you going to tell me or not?

09:12.680 --> 09:17.390
She's only decided to up sticks and
set sail for the South of France.

09:17.440 --> 09:20.030
- When? - The family
are in London next week

09:20.080 --> 09:23.470
for the racing, so she wants
to leave while they're away.

09:23.520 --> 09:25.070
- She can't do that!
- No?

09:25.120 --> 09:27.190
Well, perhaps you'll pop up and tell her.

09:27.240 --> 09:29.670
- Save me packing.
- What happens to you?

09:29.720 --> 09:33.040
What do you think? I go with her.

09:35.360 --> 09:39.470
I don't know -- strolling
along the Croisette,

09:39.520 --> 09:42.510
dining in Juan-les-Pins.

09:42.560 --> 09:45.270
- It's a burden I can bear.
- And what about me?

09:45.320 --> 09:48.110
You stay here, sticking in stamps.

09:48.160 --> 09:51.670
And so, she's going to sneak off
while they're away from home?

09:51.720 --> 09:55.190
My Lady doesn't sneak,
thank you very much.

09:55.240 --> 09:58.840
If there's any sneaking to
be done, I'll leave it to you.

09:59.200 --> 10:01.800
Must go. So much to do.

10:04.120 --> 10:06.350
It's a nuisance, but I can't help it.

10:06.400 --> 10:09.120
Two dinners, neither very grand,...

10:10.160 --> 10:13.160
- .. and clothes for Brooklands.
- Very good, My Lady.

10:14.360 --> 10:17.350
I'm sorry if you're not keen. I am.

10:17.400 --> 10:19.750
I just worry about getting
Mr Talbot's hopes up.

10:19.800 --> 10:21.470
Well, I'm curious about the fellow.

10:21.520 --> 10:25.630
Listen, I like him a lot, but I
don't believe a professional driver

10:25.680 --> 10:28.350
with very little to look
forward to will make her happy.

10:28.400 --> 10:31.790
Sybil, maybe. But not Mary.

10:31.840 --> 10:35.630
Well, that's the whole point.
What's he got that fascinates Mary

10:35.680 --> 10:39.030
when poor old Tony's rolling acres
and glistening coronet didn't.

10:39.080 --> 10:42.270
You'll say sex-appeal, but
isn't Mary too sensible?

10:42.320 --> 10:44.720
We have a very contrary daughter.

10:44.800 --> 10:47.400
Anyway, I've never been motor racing.

10:49.400 --> 10:51.950
Mr Talbot will fix it. You
can help with the picnic,

10:52.000 --> 10:55.190
but you'll have to take the train.
There won't be any room in the cars.

10:55.240 --> 10:56.870
Mr Bates is looking forward to it.

10:56.920 --> 10:59.470
- I wish I was.
- You don't have to go, you know.

10:59.520 --> 11:03.190
I think I do. It's part of
him, and I must get used to it.

11:03.240 --> 11:05.630
That sounds serious.

11:05.680 --> 11:07.390
I suppose you don't approve.

11:07.440 --> 11:10.800
- It's not for me to say, m'lady.
- But do you approve?

11:12.400 --> 11:14.800
Mr Talbot seems a nice gentleman.

11:16.040 --> 11:19.440
I'm just not sure his life
and your life fit together.

11:20.520 --> 11:23.310
- I don't mean to offend you, m'lady.
- I'm not offended.

11:23.360 --> 11:26.360
I'm troubled because I
understand what you mean.

11:30.960 --> 11:34.190
- They do say that opposites attract.
- Yes, they attract.

11:34.240 --> 11:36.780
But do they live happily ever after?

11:43.840 --> 11:46.870
I think I'll go up in a minute.

11:46.920 --> 11:49.830
How do you revise if he's
testing your general knowledge?

11:49.880 --> 11:52.110
Surely, you'll either
know it or you won't.

11:52.160 --> 11:55.310
- I just feel I have to do something.
- Is it so important to you?

11:55.360 --> 11:57.190
It's important I don't feel a fool.

11:57.240 --> 12:01.110
- You're not a fool. I'm the fool.
- Why do you say that?

12:01.160 --> 12:04.030
Because I still can't decide
what to do about Coyle.

12:04.080 --> 12:06.040
I don't know why not.

12:07.320 --> 12:10.150
Maybe if I'd given evidence in
court, but that never happened

12:10.200 --> 12:13.670
and as Her Ladyship said,
"The story feels unfinished."

12:13.720 --> 12:15.270
You sound as if you're going.

12:15.320 --> 12:18.510
I need to be sure he has
no power over me any more.

12:18.560 --> 12:20.960
Will you tell me when you decide?

12:38.560 --> 12:40.110
When Daisy said you'd like to help,

12:40.160 --> 12:43.760
I wondered if you could bring
the books up to date a bit.

12:44.120 --> 12:45.950
Or tackle some of the heavy stuff?

12:46.000 --> 12:49.190
Oh, there's nothing I can't do
until we separate the piglets.

12:49.240 --> 12:51.990
But I've got to get on top of
the figures. When can you come?

12:52.040 --> 12:54.440
I'm busy just now, as it happens.

12:56.000 --> 12:59.000
Oh, well. Let me know
when you can get away.

13:00.960 --> 13:02.750
You're leaving now? Today?

13:02.800 --> 13:04.790
I'll spend tonight in London,

13:04.840 --> 13:08.870
then I'll sail on the SS Paris
from Southampton tomorrow.

13:08.920 --> 13:11.350
We'll cruise around the Mediterranean,

13:11.400 --> 13:14.150
then I'm staying with
the Broughams in Cannes.

13:14.200 --> 13:17.550
- They keep asking me.
- Surrounded by foreigners.

13:17.600 --> 13:21.350
My reason for travelling is to
make myself eager to come home.

13:21.400 --> 13:25.030
A month among the French should manage it.

13:25.080 --> 13:27.470
- Won't Robert be hurt?
- Oh.

13:27.520 --> 13:33.150
Not as hurt as he would be
if he knew why I was going.

13:33.200 --> 13:37.670
Now, can you give this
to him when they get home?

13:37.720 --> 13:40.350
What if they want to contact
you while you're away?

13:40.400 --> 13:42.880
Well, I've... I've written to Tom.

13:43.800 --> 13:46.920
Told him how to reach me.
He's the most sensible.

13:47.640 --> 13:50.190
Oh, by the way,

13:50.240 --> 13:52.440
I called on Miss Cruikshank.

13:52.680 --> 13:54.910
And was she behind that odd invitation?

13:54.960 --> 13:59.190
The fact is, she wants you
to take Dickie off her hands

13:59.240 --> 14:01.070
and out of her hair.

14:01.120 --> 14:03.990
I'd say your choice is
harder now than before.

14:04.040 --> 14:06.990
You know, when we talked, you
didn't want to come between

14:07.040 --> 14:09.590
- a father and his sons.
- Well, what's changed?

14:09.640 --> 14:10.950
Well, now you must decide

14:11.000 --> 14:14.550
whether to abandon him to his
selfish and greedy children.

14:14.600 --> 14:16.670
I mean, is that kind or right?

14:16.720 --> 14:19.470
It's still a tug-of-war I
have no wish to be part of.

14:19.520 --> 14:23.590
Well, my guess is, when you
take delivery from Miss Amelia

14:23.640 --> 14:26.800
you'll be lucky if you
see a Christmas card.

14:29.640 --> 14:32.880
- Can you be ready by tomorrow night?
- Oh, it's just one couple.

14:33.560 --> 14:35.910
Well, the house has been
beautifully finished.

14:35.960 --> 14:37.990
No doubt about that.

14:38.040 --> 14:41.670
But there is a lot to think about.
You don't offer dinner, do you?

14:41.720 --> 14:44.710
No, if they need dinner,
they can go to the pub.

14:44.760 --> 14:47.910
But I would like to make
a thing of my breakfasts.

14:47.960 --> 14:51.990
- I want a reputation for them.
- You'll manage that easily enough.

14:52.040 --> 14:53.390
I'm here again tomorrow,

14:53.440 --> 14:56.910
but should I come back
on Thursday morning?

14:56.960 --> 14:58.550
The family will still be in London,

14:58.600 --> 15:01.190
and Daisy could easily do the
servants' hall breakfast.

15:01.240 --> 15:03.070
I have no objection.

15:03.120 --> 15:07.950
Now, dinner with Mr Carson. Why not
tomorrow night when they're away?

15:08.000 --> 15:10.710
I suppose we could eat at
a normal time, for once.

15:10.760 --> 15:14.240
Ah, well, you could and you couldn't,...

15:15.360 --> 15:17.560
.. because I've had an idea.

15:24.120 --> 15:26.670
- Oh, hello, stranger.
- I'm not really here.

15:26.720 --> 15:29.390
I'm racing at Brooklands tomorrow,
and I thought I'd pop in

15:29.440 --> 15:31.630
- and see what's new.
- Not much.

15:31.680 --> 15:34.510
Oh, although, we have had an offer today.

15:34.560 --> 15:36.750
I was going to ask you what you thought.

15:36.800 --> 15:40.030
Er, her name is Miss Cassandra Jones.

15:40.080 --> 15:42.510
She thinks we ought to
have an advice column.

15:42.560 --> 15:47.030
- With her dispensing it?
- Yes, but I must say

15:47.080 --> 15:49.150
her samples are quite funny.

15:49.200 --> 15:51.030
"Your husband is losing interest?

15:51.080 --> 15:54.550
Well, here's step one.
Take a look in the mirror."

15:54.600 --> 15:56.430
What are you proposing?

15:56.480 --> 15:59.150
We'll invent some problems,
she can write the answers,

15:59.200 --> 16:00.910
then see how the public likes it.

16:00.960 --> 16:03.870
There's nothing new in an
agony column, of course,

16:03.920 --> 16:05.910
but they're very popular in America,

16:05.960 --> 16:08.070
which means they're due a revival here.

16:08.120 --> 16:09.430
Should we interview her?

16:09.480 --> 16:11.910
No, let's leave it until
we decide to go forward.

16:11.960 --> 16:14.030
I think it's worth a try.

16:14.640 --> 16:16.710
I've never seen motor racing close up.

16:16.760 --> 16:20.190
My sister's new boyfriend
drives. Why not come?

16:20.240 --> 16:23.350
- I'm not sure I should.
- Well, I'm your employer,

16:23.400 --> 16:25.750
so if I think it's all
right then it must be.

16:25.800 --> 16:28.830
You can meet my family,
if you're strong enough.

16:28.880 --> 16:31.350
Looking round the table,

16:31.400 --> 16:34.710
I wonder if we ought to have opened
Grantham House. I feel rather guilty.

16:34.760 --> 16:36.870
Oh, don't. I know what a palaver it is.

16:36.920 --> 16:39.030
More so, now there's no real staff.

16:39.080 --> 16:41.670
Almost everyone we know is
selling their London house.

16:41.720 --> 16:43.790
But I suppose that's not for me to say.

16:43.840 --> 16:46.790
I went past the site of
Devonshire House on my way home.

16:46.840 --> 16:49.070
There's something vast
going up in its place.

16:49.120 --> 16:51.510
Flats and offices and salerooms.

16:51.560 --> 16:54.710
People don't want vast palaces any
more, even if they can afford them.

16:54.760 --> 16:56.550
They were fun, though.

16:56.600 --> 16:58.590
In my youth, all the great hostesses

16:58.640 --> 17:01.110
used to have luncheon
laid for 20 every day.

17:01.160 --> 17:04.349
And if you turned up in time, you
just sat down to a lovely feed.

17:07.359 --> 17:10.510
I'm so sorry, Lady Rosamund, I
thought dinner would be finished.

17:10.560 --> 17:13.160
And so it should be. We'll go through.

17:13.760 --> 17:17.030
Unless the boys prefer to
stay and talk racing cars.

17:17.079 --> 17:20.480
- I think I'd rather join the
ladies. - Like Lord Byron? - Hmm.

17:21.599 --> 17:24.270
Well done for rounding them
all up. I'm very grateful.

17:24.319 --> 17:26.720
Don't be. I'm as keen as you are.

17:29.360 --> 17:33.750
It's a bit obvious. Dropping
in uninvited after dinner.

17:33.800 --> 17:37.270
I hope it is obvious. Obvious that
I want to be a part of this family.

17:37.320 --> 17:39.550
Don't I have a say in the matter?

17:39.600 --> 17:44.110
I want to surround you with people
murmuring, "Isn't he divine?"

17:44.160 --> 17:45.950
Or "You'd be mad to let him go."

17:46.000 --> 17:48.750
Suppose they say, "I shouldn't
have thought a racing driver

17:48.800 --> 17:50.390
was your sort of thing at all"?

17:50.440 --> 17:53.310
They don't have to,
you've already said it.

17:53.920 --> 17:57.070
I'm afraid there's a list as
long as your arm of people

17:57.120 --> 17:58.910
- who are coming tomorrow.
- Hmm.

17:58.960 --> 18:01.390
Just give me the list
and I'll sort it out.

18:01.440 --> 18:04.310
Did you mind my inviting your
family without telling you?

18:04.360 --> 18:06.160
I'm here, aren't I?

18:07.760 --> 18:09.700
Let's get some coffee.

18:15.880 --> 18:17.510
Are you prepared for your exams?

18:17.560 --> 18:20.750
- I've done as much as I'm able.
- No-one can say more.

18:20.800 --> 18:23.430
I confess, I wasn't always sure about it,

18:23.480 --> 18:27.430
but now you've got there, well done.
I wish you every good fortune.

18:27.480 --> 18:29.270
I wonder where she'll go from here.

18:29.320 --> 18:31.190
Doesn't Gwen's visit show us that

18:31.240 --> 18:34.150
in the new century anything is possible?

18:34.200 --> 18:36.550
And what about you, Mr
Molesley, are you ready?

18:36.600 --> 18:38.790
I think so, hmm. Ready as I'll ever be.

18:38.840 --> 18:41.950
I'll walk down with some lunch
for you and Daisy and Mr Dawes.

18:42.000 --> 18:43.990
- Oh, you don't have to.
- No, I'd like to.

18:44.040 --> 18:45.190
I'll give you a hand.

18:45.240 --> 18:48.110
Mr Barrow, what are you doing
with your free time tomorrow?

18:48.160 --> 18:51.840
Scanning the jobs column,
Mrs Hughes, what else?

19:08.400 --> 19:10.350
There, that's got it.

19:10.400 --> 19:12.070
I think you're all set.

19:12.120 --> 19:15.510
- It's a good car.
- Clearly, we need you on the team.

19:15.560 --> 19:17.600
Don't tempt me, Henry.

19:19.080 --> 19:21.470
- Who's this?
- Laura Edmunds, my editor.

19:21.520 --> 19:23.910
Laura, this is Tom
Branson, my brother-in-law,

19:23.960 --> 19:26.470
and the man of the hour, Mr Henry Talbot.

19:26.520 --> 19:29.270
- Hello.
- My sister, Mary.

19:29.320 --> 19:32.350
These are my parents. You can
sort them out in your own time.

19:32.400 --> 19:35.990
- Nice to meet you at last.
- Lord Grantham, Lady Grantham.

19:36.040 --> 19:38.630
This is Charlie Rogers.
He drives on Henry's team.

19:38.680 --> 19:42.110
Henry's team, is it? When I beat
him into a cocked hat every time.

19:42.160 --> 19:45.270
Oh, he's just showing off. I'm
faster, I'm younger and better.

19:45.320 --> 19:46.790
But not at driving.

19:46.840 --> 19:49.510
I wish there was something
more I could do to be useful.

19:49.560 --> 19:52.750
- Oh, just cheer, Tom.
- I don't have to be asked.

19:52.800 --> 19:55.430
I don't know why I'm doing
this. I can't even swallow.

19:55.480 --> 19:58.110
It's all terribly swank, not
a bit what we're used to.

19:58.160 --> 20:01.230
- No? - Normally, it's an oil-stained
sandwich and a bottle of pop.

20:01.280 --> 20:03.990
Well, I'm glad to think
we've brought an improvement.

20:04.040 --> 20:05.430
Thank you.

20:05.480 --> 20:07.790
My train sat in a tunnel for an hour.

20:07.840 --> 20:09.710
Anyway, I'm here now.

20:10.480 --> 20:12.190
Come and meet Miss Edmunds.

20:12.240 --> 20:16.470
Is it hard to be a woman editor?
Fleet Street sounds so very tough.

20:16.520 --> 20:19.390
It's hard to be a woman
anything if it isn't domestic.

20:19.440 --> 20:22.670
- But I do my best.
- I think it's courageous and good.

20:22.720 --> 20:26.390
Heavens! Papa's conversion to the
modern world is almost complete.

20:26.440 --> 20:30.550
Don't be deceived. He'd still like
to see us happy wives and mothers.

20:30.600 --> 20:33.470
That's not fair. Even leopards
can change some of their spots.

20:33.520 --> 20:36.060
Quite. Now, there's still some food.

20:38.520 --> 20:41.390
I'm glad no-one seems unhappy
that Lady Edith hired a woman.

20:41.440 --> 20:44.270
You're a big improvement on the
last editor, that's for sure.

20:44.320 --> 20:47.830
And you're not the only one around
here who's broken a few barriers.

20:47.880 --> 20:51.180
I started my life at Downton
Abbey as the chauffeur.

20:51.440 --> 20:52.790
I think we're being summoned.

20:52.840 --> 20:55.390
- The cars are in place. We should go.
- Right behind you.

20:55.440 --> 20:57.910
You'll stay there if I have my way.

20:59.280 --> 21:02.190
I can't begin to tell you what it
means to me that you came today.

21:02.240 --> 21:05.550
I hope so, because my digestive
system has packed up completely.

21:05.600 --> 21:08.910
I'm going to be fine. Mary, you
must credit me with SOME skill.

21:08.960 --> 21:13.550
Now, when I pass you, I expect
to see you cheer and wave.

21:13.600 --> 21:15.070
Does praying count?

21:15.120 --> 21:17.120
- Henry!
- Coming.

21:24.000 --> 21:26.600
Well, that should keep my spirits up.

21:28.840 --> 21:30.910
I'll see you in a minute.

21:46.200 --> 21:49.280
'We're just waiting for the last chap...'

21:50.640 --> 21:54.080
'And here he comes. It's Henry
Talbot, driving car No.14.'

21:56.480 --> 21:58.280
Good luck, Charlie.

21:59.240 --> 22:00.670
Good luck, old boy.

22:00.720 --> 22:02.630
'Now, any moment,

22:02.680 --> 22:05.620
the flag will fall and
the race will begin.'

22:21.640 --> 22:25.830
'Just listen to the roar of those
engines, ladies and gentlemen.'

22:25.880 --> 22:29.270
And they're off. There they
go, tearing down the street

22:29.320 --> 22:31.920
and jostling for first position.

22:33.040 --> 22:34.960
Come on, Charlie!

23:12.440 --> 23:14.110
Here they come!

23:20.200 --> 23:21.430
Come on, Talbot!

23:21.480 --> 23:24.550
I don't think you can shout that.
Isn't Talbot the name of a car?

23:24.600 --> 23:27.470
I can't shout "Come on, Henry."
They might all be called Henry.

23:27.520 --> 23:30.190
- Oh, my God, here they are.
- Come on!

23:31.960 --> 23:35.360
- When will it be over?
- Not soon, they go round and round.

23:37.880 --> 23:39.190
Yes! Come on!

23:39.240 --> 23:41.580
Come on! God bless you! Come on!

23:41.880 --> 23:44.070
What's the point? What
do they get out of it?

23:44.120 --> 23:46.440
What do you think? Speed.

23:47.560 --> 23:49.310
This is kind of you, Mrs Patmore.

23:49.360 --> 23:52.350
I meant to bring some lemonade, but
I left it on the kitchen table.

23:52.400 --> 23:53.790
I could kick meself.

23:53.840 --> 23:55.510
Is this what you mean?

23:55.560 --> 23:58.560
Oh, that was kind of you,
Mr Barrow. Thank you.

23:59.360 --> 24:01.270
How were the exams? Did you do well?

24:01.320 --> 24:03.630
We can't know the answer
to that, can we, Mr Dawes?

24:03.680 --> 24:05.430
You'll find out soon enough.

24:05.480 --> 24:07.110
But Daisy will have to wait a while.

24:07.160 --> 24:10.150
I've not finished yet. I've got
three more papers after lunch.

24:10.200 --> 24:13.390
- Was it harder than you thought?
- See for yourself.

24:13.440 --> 24:16.310
What about number two? It knocked
me for a loop, I can tell you.

24:16.360 --> 24:19.560
What does it say? Read it out, Andy.

24:21.080 --> 24:23.880
- I'll read it.
- Why, what's the matter?

24:25.280 --> 24:26.620
"Tsar...

24:27.480 --> 24:29.220
"Nic... holas..."

24:34.960 --> 24:36.760
Here, give it here.

24:39.200 --> 24:42.270
"Tsar Nicholas I called Turkey
'the sick man of Europe'.

24:42.320 --> 24:44.270
What were the causes of Turkey's illness

24:44.320 --> 24:47.880
and what measure was the Russian
Tsar prescribing for its recovery?"

24:51.240 --> 24:53.670
I can't read, Mr Molesley.

24:53.720 --> 24:57.310
At least Mr Barrow's been
trying to teach me to read,

24:57.360 --> 25:00.350
- but I'm too stupid to learn.
- Don't say that.

25:00.400 --> 25:03.600
So, there we have it. I'm
a fool who knows nothing.

25:05.200 --> 25:06.740
I am nothing.

25:09.320 --> 25:11.270
'The race is going to hot up now

25:11.320 --> 25:15.230
because the lead car,
car No.6, has withdrawn

25:15.280 --> 25:18.230
with what looks like
radiator trouble. Oh, dear.

25:18.280 --> 25:21.280
It looks like Sir Patrick
has blown a gasket too!'

25:39.000 --> 25:40.870
Here they come again.

25:43.360 --> 25:45.990
- My God, but don't you envy them?
- No, I don't.

25:46.040 --> 25:49.240
Nor me. We're going to
have to keep an eye on Tom.

25:50.880 --> 25:54.600
There is something gallant and
daring in it, even I can see that.

26:01.320 --> 26:05.110
Andy, maybe I can help,
if you'd like me to.

26:05.160 --> 26:07.950
Oh, that's very kind.
What do you say, Andy?

26:08.000 --> 26:11.350
Well, I've tried and tried with Mr
Barrow, and I can't break through.

26:11.400 --> 26:14.470
- I'm too stupid.
- Will you stop saying that?

26:14.520 --> 26:18.830
You're not stupid, and I promise you I
can soon have you reading for pleasure.

26:18.880 --> 26:22.190
If you'll just come two or three
times a week after school closes.

26:22.240 --> 26:24.630
- Could you manage that?
- That's the best time for me.

26:24.680 --> 26:26.230
It won't take long, you'll see.

26:26.280 --> 26:28.110
- We can go on with...
- Mr Barrow,

26:28.160 --> 26:30.070
it might be better if you step back now.

26:30.120 --> 26:34.790
You've been very generous, but we wouldn't
want to confuse Andy with different methods.

26:34.840 --> 26:36.150
No, of course not.

26:36.200 --> 26:39.310
I hate to cut this short, but Daisy's
still got a lot of work to do

26:39.360 --> 26:41.710
- and she better get started.
- Need any help?

26:41.760 --> 26:43.910
- I can manage.
- Well, good luck, Daisy.

26:43.960 --> 26:45.630
Yes, good luck.

26:48.200 --> 26:51.030
Funny when the house is
empty above decks and below.

26:51.080 --> 26:53.510
All the more reason for us to be vigilant.

26:53.560 --> 26:56.710
- Let's sit down.
- Erm, I don't know.

26:56.760 --> 26:59.000
Oh, just for a moment.

27:07.520 --> 27:09.430
- Hmm.
- There.

27:09.480 --> 27:11.420
That's nice, isn't it?

27:12.320 --> 27:14.750
They don't live badly,
you have to concede.

27:14.800 --> 27:18.350
They live as they're supposed
to live. It has its burdens

27:18.400 --> 27:19.630
and its benefits.

27:19.680 --> 27:21.990
Better than a life of just burden.

27:22.040 --> 27:23.950
I hope you're ready for tonight.

27:24.000 --> 27:28.110
For once, we can eat when civilised
people eat, so don't be late back.

27:28.160 --> 27:30.430
Are you sure you know how to cook it?

27:30.480 --> 27:35.080
Don't you worry. I've been through
every detail with Mrs Patmore.

27:42.720 --> 27:44.550
Hello.

27:44.600 --> 27:46.270
What have we here?

27:46.320 --> 27:50.520
- Can anyone join in?
- No, Mr Barrow, they cannot.

27:53.360 --> 27:56.910
'It's shaping up to be a tight
battle for the winner's laurels.

27:56.960 --> 28:00.190
What's this? The No.8
Bentley is slowing down!

28:00.240 --> 28:02.150
It's pulled in at the side of the track.

28:02.200 --> 28:04.630
Looks like steering trouble.
And there goes Rogers!

28:04.680 --> 28:06.510
Rogers has taken the lead and now look!

28:06.560 --> 28:09.910
Henry Talbot in car No.14 tries
to snatch the lead away from him.

28:09.960 --> 28:12.390
Here he comes again!

28:12.440 --> 28:15.510
Talbot attacking from the inside
and challenging for the lead.

28:15.560 --> 28:18.860
I don't think Rogers has
the power to fight him off!

28:34.360 --> 28:38.150
Oh, dear, look! Rogers
is coming back at him!

28:38.200 --> 28:40.750
Would you believe it? He's
going to take back the lead!

28:40.800 --> 28:43.870
What a stunning piece of
driving by Charles Rogers!'

28:43.920 --> 28:46.830
And here they come again,
it's the two Bentleys

28:46.880 --> 28:50.360
neck and neck past the
grandstand. Come on, Bentley boys!

28:56.080 --> 28:57.440
Come on!

29:02.040 --> 29:03.910
Chin up. Won't be long now.

29:03.960 --> 29:06.670
Really? It feels as if we're
trapped in some witch's curse

29:06.720 --> 29:08.670
for all eternity.

29:11.080 --> 29:13.670
'This is terrible. This is awful!'

29:13.720 --> 29:16.720
- Stay here. Bertie, come with me.
- Of course.

29:17.720 --> 29:20.060
No, it's no good. I can't stay.

29:22.040 --> 29:24.180
You're not going anywhere.

29:25.560 --> 29:28.150
- I must go to her!
- No, no, Anna. Not in your condition.

29:28.200 --> 29:31.630
- Never mind, I have to go.
- Can you follow her, please?

29:31.680 --> 29:33.080
Of course.

29:38.560 --> 29:40.670
Get him out of there!

29:40.720 --> 29:42.080
Charlie!

29:45.120 --> 29:46.990
- Turn around!
- Charlie!

29:47.040 --> 29:49.550
It's too late. Henry, Henry, get back!

29:49.600 --> 29:51.470
Henry, Henry, get back!

29:51.520 --> 29:53.950
- Charlie!
- He's gone, Henry.

29:54.000 --> 29:55.840
No! Charlie!

29:57.160 --> 29:58.760
Charlie!

30:01.760 --> 30:03.990
We have to help him. Charlie!

30:04.040 --> 30:05.670
- Charlie!
- Let me pass.

30:05.720 --> 30:07.390
I know him. Let me pass!

30:07.440 --> 30:10.310
You can't say that. We
don't know it's him.

30:11.640 --> 30:14.110
- Oh, my God.
- I need help here!

30:15.240 --> 30:20.080
Who is it? Can we find out who
it is? Tom, Bertie, who is it?

30:21.640 --> 30:23.980
I'm afraid it's Charlie Rogers.

30:54.600 --> 30:56.440
He was my friend.

30:58.000 --> 31:00.590
My best friend, really.

31:00.640 --> 31:04.340
If that phrase didn't sound
like it was something from a...

31:04.720 --> 31:06.720
.. Rider Haggard novel.

31:08.920 --> 31:13.430
I keep asking myself
if I... encouraged him.

31:13.480 --> 31:16.310
Of course you encouraged him,

31:16.360 --> 31:19.670
- and he encouraged you.
- Yes, but I'm so stupid, I...

31:19.720 --> 31:21.230
I...

31:21.280 --> 31:26.310
I needled him and I
teased him, I pushed him.

31:26.360 --> 31:28.230
And he did the same.

31:28.800 --> 31:30.710
And if you'd have died instead of him,

31:30.760 --> 31:33.270
he'd be here asking exactly
the same questions.

31:33.320 --> 31:35.720
Yes, but I didn't die and he did!

31:38.080 --> 31:40.280
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

31:45.280 --> 31:47.470
We're going now.

31:47.520 --> 31:50.550
Aunt Rosamund doesn't want
to cancel dinner tonight.

31:50.600 --> 31:54.200
She thinks we should all be
together on a day like today.

31:56.520 --> 31:59.680
I can't. I have to deal
with Charlie's family.

32:01.520 --> 32:03.920
Of course. I wasn't thinking.

32:04.920 --> 32:06.720
Tell her thank you.

32:09.720 --> 32:12.110
- And, Mary...
- No.

32:12.160 --> 32:14.640
Let's not do any of that stuff now.

32:35.040 --> 32:39.040
Go on, then. Put us out of our
misery. Did he pass or not?

32:40.160 --> 32:44.230
Mr Molesley, I'd be very glad

32:44.280 --> 32:47.030
if you would join the teaching
staff at the village school.

32:47.080 --> 32:48.750
Well, I'll be...

32:50.240 --> 32:52.550
Very good of you to come
up tonight to tell me.

32:52.600 --> 32:55.070
Does that mean you'll be a
teacher and not a servant?

32:55.120 --> 32:57.230
- When will you be leaving?
- Give him a moment.

32:57.280 --> 32:58.710
There's a lot to be settled.

32:58.760 --> 33:02.070
- Course there is.
- I'm impressed, Mr Molesley.

33:02.120 --> 33:05.400
There are Oxford and Cambridge
graduates who know far less than you.

33:06.680 --> 33:08.550
You should be proud.

33:09.720 --> 33:11.200
Good night.

33:12.760 --> 33:14.160
Mr Dawes.

33:16.000 --> 33:17.870
Thank you very much.

33:22.680 --> 33:24.680
Well done, Mr Molesley.

33:25.440 --> 33:28.830
- It'll be you next.
- I doubt it, but thanks.

33:28.880 --> 33:32.190
We should celebrate. Come into the
kitchen while I get the dinner going.

33:32.240 --> 33:35.940
There's a bottle of wine there,
if Mr Carson wouldn't mind.

33:36.000 --> 33:38.190
Is that the end of service for you?

33:38.240 --> 33:41.390
Hmm, service is ending
for most of us, Daisy.

33:41.440 --> 33:43.510
I've just got a head start.

33:43.560 --> 33:44.590
Will you miss it?

33:44.640 --> 33:47.190
Oh, let's face it. I were
never going to make butler.

33:47.240 --> 33:49.310
Well, not in a proper house like this one.

33:49.360 --> 33:52.630
And from now on, there's going
to be more and more people

33:52.680 --> 33:57.110
chasing fewer and fewer
jobs, so it's probably time.

33:57.160 --> 33:59.270
And this seemed like a good way to go.

33:59.320 --> 34:01.870
Well, I'm glad. You deserve it.

34:01.920 --> 34:04.790
I never think I deserve anything.

34:04.840 --> 34:07.310
Perhaps I've been wrong all along.

34:08.760 --> 34:10.590
Are you coming, Mr Barrow?

34:10.639 --> 34:12.960
In a minute. You go ahead.

34:15.480 --> 34:17.710
Here you are, Daisy, you have one.

34:17.760 --> 34:21.520
- Andy, come on. Have a glass of wine.
- Congratulations.

34:28.360 --> 34:30.070
But how did you do it?

34:30.120 --> 34:34.750
Er, I must have stumbled and
fallen over in the wrong way.

34:34.800 --> 34:39.429
Mrs Patmore put on a bandage, but I'll go to
the doctor in the morning if it's no better.

34:39.480 --> 34:42.560
- But how are you going to cook?
- I can't cook!

34:43.800 --> 34:45.350
I can't lift.

34:45.400 --> 34:48.429
But it's not difficult. I'll
talk you through it, don't worry.

34:48.480 --> 34:52.350
You mean... I'm going to cook?!

34:52.400 --> 34:55.070
It's very straightforward.

34:55.120 --> 34:57.390
Now, get the chicken
in the oven right away,

34:57.440 --> 34:59.910
then peel the potatoes and
prepare the cauliflower.

34:59.960 --> 35:02.030
Oh, and put a kettle on to boil.

35:02.080 --> 35:05.950
You should find bread and an
onion for the bread sauce.

35:06.000 --> 35:08.940
Butter and milk are in
the meat safe outside.

35:13.760 --> 35:16.920
I assume that none of us are
going to eat anything else.

35:18.280 --> 35:21.950
One talks of risk and danger,
and it sounds like fun.

35:22.000 --> 35:26.760
But of course, the reality
behind it is sudden death.

35:28.400 --> 35:31.030
Sudden, stupid, wasteful death.

35:31.080 --> 35:35.320
It was a bloody awful business.
A bloody, bloody awful business.

35:36.720 --> 35:40.000
- The English language never
lets you down. - Oh, shut up!

35:44.200 --> 35:46.070
Shall we go through?

35:46.200 --> 35:48.670
- You're going to bed.
- Me, too.

35:49.480 --> 35:51.830
The rest of you can talk
into the small hours.

35:51.880 --> 35:54.390
Should I say goodbye?

35:54.440 --> 35:57.440
Not yet. Come into the
drawing room for a drink.

36:07.560 --> 36:09.630
Henry's on the telephone.

36:11.480 --> 36:13.150
Tell him to ring tomorrow.

36:13.200 --> 36:15.540
I think you should speak to him.

36:22.640 --> 36:24.550
'You should try to sleep.'

36:24.600 --> 36:28.440
I found that I had to
hear your voice first.

36:30.600 --> 36:32.560
The truth is...

36:33.600 --> 36:35.950
.. I won't sleep until I
know where we're headed.

36:36.000 --> 36:39.070
Henry, please let's not do this now.

36:39.120 --> 36:43.080
- Think of Charlie, not us.
- Hear me out. Charlie would have.

36:44.240 --> 36:47.230
Because his death has made me realise

36:47.280 --> 36:49.550
we don't have a minute
to waste, you and I.

36:49.600 --> 36:52.670
This is my carpe diem moment. I...

36:52.720 --> 36:55.200
- I must seize the day.
- No.

36:59.200 --> 37:03.070
- What do you mean?
- I'm sorry, I wouldn't have said this now,

37:03.120 --> 37:06.400
but today has made me
realise something, too.

37:08.120 --> 37:10.720
We're not meant to be together, Henry.

37:11.160 --> 37:12.710
- We're not right.
- I can...

37:12.760 --> 37:14.910
Don't start saying you'll give up racing.

37:14.960 --> 37:17.350
I don't want you to give up anything

37:17.400 --> 37:19.630
- except me.
- I can't give you up.

37:19.680 --> 37:22.870
Please. I wish you nothing but good.

37:22.920 --> 37:25.660
I want you to have a long and happy life.

37:26.520 --> 37:29.030
- Just not with me.
- Mary, please don't do this.

37:29.080 --> 37:30.360
I must.

37:32.760 --> 37:34.640
Good night, Henry.

37:40.440 --> 37:43.150
I wish you wouldn't.

37:43.200 --> 37:47.790
Do you know the worst thing?
When they said it was Charlie

37:47.840 --> 37:50.070
and not Henry who was dead, I was glad!

37:50.120 --> 37:52.590
Think of that. I was glad!

37:52.640 --> 37:54.150
You're not seeing straight.

37:54.200 --> 37:57.030
Today brought up Matthew's
death and all the rest of it.

37:57.080 --> 37:59.950
- You're in a black mist.
- It's not what I want!

38:00.000 --> 38:02.600
You're frightened of being hurt again.

38:03.040 --> 38:05.110
But let me tell you this.

38:06.120 --> 38:08.830
You will be hurt again, and so will I,

38:08.880 --> 38:11.680
because being hurt is part of being alive.

38:12.040 --> 38:16.140
But that is no reason to give up
on the man who is right for you.

38:31.880 --> 38:34.510
I'm sorry I'm a bit behind.

38:34.560 --> 38:36.710
The potatoes may have caught.

38:36.760 --> 38:39.390
Never mind. Er, how's the cauliflower?

38:39.440 --> 38:40.780
Oh, God.

38:42.680 --> 38:44.550
Oh, while you're there,

38:44.600 --> 38:47.070
put in the apple crumble. Bottom oven.

38:47.120 --> 38:49.200
Mmm.

38:54.480 --> 38:56.350
I think it's been a good day.

38:56.400 --> 38:59.590
The funny thing is, I quite
enjoyed it in the end.

38:59.640 --> 39:01.990
I'm glad it's turned out
well for Mr Molesley.

39:02.040 --> 39:04.430
And Andy. I think that'll
turn out well an' all.

39:04.480 --> 39:09.630
I suppose so. Even if he only wants to read
to learn more about farming from Mr Mason.

39:09.680 --> 39:11.830
And if he does? You must share, Daisy.

39:11.880 --> 39:14.830
Love isn't finite. If Mr
Mason makes new friends,

39:14.880 --> 39:17.150
it doesn't mean he has
any less love for you.

39:17.200 --> 39:18.670
Doesn't it?

39:19.960 --> 39:22.630
I never had much that
was my own, you know.

39:22.680 --> 39:26.880
Well, you found the love of a father
there and you can count on him.

39:27.840 --> 39:30.030
Just as you can count on me.

39:30.080 --> 39:32.620
Now, run along and I'll finish this.

39:36.480 --> 39:39.030
Mmm. This crumble's good.

39:39.080 --> 39:42.160
My mother's was always a bit soggy.

39:45.880 --> 39:48.510
Hmm, crumble. Oh!

39:48.560 --> 39:51.000
Is that it now? Are we done?

39:52.640 --> 39:54.670
Oh, just put the things in to soak.

39:54.720 --> 39:56.750
Make sure you cover the pots with water.

39:56.800 --> 40:00.110
You don't have to do the washing up
till tomorrow if you don't want to.

40:00.160 --> 40:03.190
- You won't be better by the morning?
- Oh, not for that.

40:03.240 --> 40:07.110
We could ask Billy to come over,
but he's got his own work to do.

40:07.160 --> 40:09.470
You don't mind, do you?

40:09.520 --> 40:12.240
No, I don't mind.

40:16.080 --> 40:19.400
I expect you're glad to
get to bed. I know I am.

40:20.320 --> 40:22.470
- What is it?
- I just wondered if I was right.

40:22.520 --> 40:24.590
That you're to be congratulated.

40:24.640 --> 40:28.110
It's a bit early to
shout about it, but yes.

40:28.160 --> 40:32.310
I'm happy for you. It's good
to think of a new life coming,

40:32.360 --> 40:34.630
especially on a day like this.

40:34.960 --> 40:36.700
Well, good night.

40:43.280 --> 40:45.510
Look at you, stretched out like a pasha.

40:45.560 --> 40:47.590
A creature of leisure.

40:47.640 --> 40:51.310
Early night for me. He went to
bed when he left the dining room.

40:51.360 --> 40:54.510
Not for me. She's very shaken.

40:54.560 --> 40:57.270
- By the crash?
- Because of the crash,

40:57.320 --> 40:59.790
and she's broken up with Mr Talbot.

40:59.840 --> 41:03.790
I wouldn't have thought it was the right
night to make that sort of decision.

41:03.840 --> 41:05.790
She says she's sure.

41:05.840 --> 41:08.510
- Do you think she's right?
- I don't know.

41:08.560 --> 41:10.110
Probably.

41:10.160 --> 41:12.720
Then there's no more to be said.

41:18.480 --> 41:20.710
I'm afraid I've got to go.

41:20.760 --> 41:22.830
You've been such a help.

41:22.880 --> 41:26.870
It's odd, isn't it? We
witnessed a tragedy today

41:26.920 --> 41:29.550
but, sitting here with your arm around me,

41:29.600 --> 41:32.430
I can't remember feeling so comfortable.

41:32.480 --> 41:35.870
When you say things like
that, you make me so happy.

41:35.920 --> 41:39.710
If it isn't wrong to feel
happy on a day like this.

41:39.760 --> 41:43.910
I don't believe it's ever wrong
to feel happy and confident

41:43.960 --> 41:45.230
in someone else's company.

41:45.280 --> 41:47.430
Do I really make you feel those things?

41:47.480 --> 41:49.750
It's not a trap.

41:49.800 --> 41:52.150
Today has been sad and wretched,

41:52.200 --> 41:55.990
and having you here has
helped me face it, that's all.

41:56.040 --> 41:59.840
The thing is, I'd like
to be trapped, and...

42:00.960 --> 42:02.990
Well, I better just say it.

42:03.040 --> 42:04.870
I want to marry you.

42:04.920 --> 42:07.430
- Oh!
- You're not offended?

42:07.480 --> 42:10.110
Offended? Why would I be offended?

42:10.160 --> 42:12.590
I'm thrilled, I'm delighted.

42:12.640 --> 42:17.150
- I'm just rather surprised.
- Why? You know I'm mad about you.

42:17.200 --> 42:20.510
I don't ever think I'm the
sort of girl men are mad about.

42:20.560 --> 42:23.190
Then you're wrong, because I am.

42:23.240 --> 42:25.110
I... I know I've not got much to offer

42:25.160 --> 42:27.030
and your father's probably hoping for

42:27.080 --> 42:28.750
more than a penniless land agent,

42:28.800 --> 42:31.550
but if love is allowed
to weigh in the balance,

42:31.600 --> 42:33.600
I've got plenty of that.

42:34.520 --> 42:36.680
I must ask you something.

42:38.240 --> 42:40.630
Would you let me bring Marigold with me?

42:40.680 --> 42:42.110
Marigold?

42:42.160 --> 42:44.550
Your family's ward?

42:44.600 --> 42:47.910
You see, I'm much fonder
of her than anyone else,

42:47.960 --> 42:50.360
and I'd hate to leave her behind.

42:50.480 --> 42:52.030
If she means that much to you.

42:52.080 --> 42:54.270
Of course, I hope we'll
have children of our own

42:54.320 --> 42:57.270
- before close of play.
- Oh, absolutely. I'd like that, too.

42:57.320 --> 43:00.120
- Does that mean you accept?
- Not quite.

43:01.120 --> 43:04.350
I'll have to think about it. I'm
sorry to be a killjoy, but I must.

43:04.400 --> 43:07.590
Be my guest. I'm not going
to marry anyone else.

43:07.640 --> 43:10.640
Not until after you've
broken my heart, anyway.

43:13.880 --> 43:15.220
I'll go.

43:16.120 --> 43:18.070
Kiss me first.

43:18.120 --> 43:21.520
And I promise I won't
keep you waiting too long.

43:42.480 --> 43:45.350
All right, let's see
what you make of that.

43:46.320 --> 43:49.710
Now, I must be off, but my
niece, Lucy, is in the kitchen.

43:49.760 --> 43:53.160
- She'll see to everything.
- Thank you. - Thank you.

44:04.280 --> 44:05.750
Hello, Carson.

44:05.800 --> 44:07.910
Mrs Crawley is in the library, My Lord.

44:07.960 --> 44:09.510
She's been here for some time.

44:09.560 --> 44:11.390
- Why?
- She didn't say, My Lady,

44:11.440 --> 44:13.270
but she seems eager to see you all.

44:13.320 --> 44:17.790
Also, er, Mr Spratt rang to ask
when you'd be arriving from London.

44:17.840 --> 44:20.390
- Mr Spratt?
- The Dowager Countess' butler.

44:20.440 --> 44:22.470
Oh, that Mr Spratt. What did he want?

44:22.520 --> 44:26.120
- Again, no explanation was proffered.
- Curiouser and curiouser.

44:27.120 --> 44:30.070
Isobel, I hope we haven't
kept you waiting for hours.

44:30.120 --> 44:33.750
Not at all, it's entirely my
fault. I got here far too early.

44:33.800 --> 44:36.310
- How was it?
- Perfectly terrible, as it happens,

44:36.360 --> 44:38.030
but let's not go into that now.

44:38.080 --> 44:40.350
Oh, I am sorry. And, to be quite honest,

44:40.400 --> 44:44.270
- I feel rather awkward.
- Why, what is it?

44:44.320 --> 44:46.870
I have a letter from Cousin Violet.

44:46.920 --> 44:49.110
Why didn't she bring it herself?

44:49.160 --> 44:52.510
- Because she's gone away.
- Gone away? Where?

44:52.560 --> 44:56.150
She's on board the Paris,
headed for the Mediterranean.

44:56.200 --> 45:00.230
This is me, isn't it? I've
done it. She's furious with me.

45:00.280 --> 45:02.670
I don't see the point of
bringing any of that up now.

45:02.720 --> 45:05.990
- What does it say in the letter?
- Nothing much.

45:06.040 --> 45:08.150
She needs a change of air,

45:08.200 --> 45:11.430
and Spratt is bringing a
present by way of goodbye.

45:11.480 --> 45:13.110
That's why he rang.

45:13.160 --> 45:15.070
Mr Spratt has arrived, My Lord.

45:15.120 --> 45:17.350
- Oh, show him in.
- Well, that is,

45:17.400 --> 45:18.990
he's in the servants' hall

45:19.040 --> 45:23.270
with a present for Your Lordship and
he doesn't want to bring it up here.

45:23.320 --> 45:27.230
- What is going on?
- He may be right, My Lord.

45:27.280 --> 45:29.230
- Let's go and see what it is.
- If you wish,

45:29.280 --> 45:31.620
but it all seems very rum to me.

45:32.960 --> 45:35.030
What is it? What's the surprise?

45:35.080 --> 45:38.110
You'll soon see, m'lord,
but I think it's a good one.

45:38.160 --> 45:39.750
- Good day, m'lord.
- Spratt, what is

45:39.800 --> 45:41.790
this great secret you're about to reveal?

45:41.840 --> 45:46.080
Her Ladyship chose her herself,
m'lord. Er, she was most particular.

45:48.360 --> 45:52.310
Oh! Hello, little one!

45:52.360 --> 45:53.840
Oh!

45:56.600 --> 45:59.390
Now, what are we going to call you, eh?

45:59.440 --> 46:01.710
Oh, I know, Tiaa.

46:01.760 --> 46:04.390
I thought we always had
names from ancient Egypt.

46:04.440 --> 46:08.750
Tiaa was a wife of Amenhotep II
and the mother of Thutmose IV.

46:08.800 --> 46:10.030
Don't you know anything?

46:10.080 --> 46:11.950
She's not exactly trained yet, m'lord.

46:12.000 --> 46:14.550
so we decided against
bringing her up to the library.

46:14.600 --> 46:17.630
Oh, I don't care about that.
You're coming upstairs with me.

46:18.960 --> 46:20.630
Tom, what about this, eh?

46:20.680 --> 46:22.790
He does love his dogs.

46:22.840 --> 46:26.750
How were your guests this morning?
Was everything satisfactory?

46:26.800 --> 46:31.390
Oh, very. He was a doctor,
Mrs Hughes. Imagine that!

46:31.440 --> 46:34.270
So, I don't think I could
have started better.

46:34.320 --> 46:36.670
Even if I did work harder
over their breakfast

46:36.720 --> 46:39.230
than anything I've done
since Lady Rose got married.

46:39.280 --> 46:41.030
Oh, talking of which,

46:41.080 --> 46:44.670
has Mr Carson survived his
ordeal from last night?

46:44.720 --> 46:46.150
Put it this way --

46:46.200 --> 46:50.750
he has discovered a new respect for
the role of cook and bottle washer.

46:50.800 --> 46:53.710
So I think he'll be giving
less trouble in the future.

46:53.760 --> 46:56.000
What's so funny?

46:57.080 --> 46:58.960
Just life, Mr Carson.

47:00.040 --> 47:01.440
Just life.

47:08.120 --> 47:09.710
You push in here, into my home,

47:09.760 --> 47:11.870
to call me a grubby little gold-digger?

47:11.920 --> 47:13.270
You've got a nerve.

47:13.320 --> 47:16.750
I wouldn't like to see this family
dragged into a local brouhaha.

47:16.800 --> 47:18.070
He means me.

47:18.120 --> 47:20.830
I'm not as simple as I used to
be. My life is not as simple.

47:20.880 --> 47:22.590
What would they say if they found out

47:22.640 --> 47:25.750
that I was a servant at the big
house? What would their parents say?

47:25.800 --> 47:30.240
I know you. I know you to be a
nasty, jealous, scheming bitch.
