00:30.976 --> 00:32.656
<i>Have you ever had
one of those days</i>

00:32.703 --> 00:35.352
<i>where everything
just turns to shit?</i>

00:36.353 --> 00:37.855
<i>This is one of those.</i>

00:38.823 --> 00:40.457
<i>I'm Freddy, by the way.</i>

00:42.626 --> 00:44.628
<i>This is The Upholsterer.</i>

00:44.829 --> 00:47.464
<i>She doesn't just cut up foam
and leather and shit.</i>

00:47.497 --> 00:50.735
<i>I've seen the real reason she's
called what she's called.</i>

00:50.768 --> 00:52.770
<i>This is Mr Spiggs.</i>

00:53.370 --> 00:55.840
<i>Once upon a time,
I thought he was cool.</i>

00:56.674 --> 00:57.942
<i>This is Semo.</i>

00:57.975 --> 01:00.477
<i>In another life,
we might have been mates.</i>

01:00.778 --> 01:01.779
<i>Not today.</i>

01:02.546 --> 01:03.447
<i>This is Roy.</i>

01:03.480 --> 01:06.583
<i>The dude must be on meth
cos he's psycho.</i>

01:07.652 --> 01:10.655
<i>I'm here for this fulla...
my boy Marvin.</i>

01:11.288 --> 01:12.456
<i>I've known him forever,</i>

01:12.489 --> 01:14.391
<i>and we'd do anything
for each other.</i>

01:15.026 --> 01:17.561
<i>Which is why I'm here
with a gun in each hand</i>

01:17.594 --> 01:19.329
<i>and a naked Samoan.</i>

01:20.031 --> 01:23.333
Semo, how did Freddy
get a gun?

01:23.366 --> 01:25.368
And why can I see
your genitals?

01:25.402 --> 01:27.237
- Fucking Roy's fault.
- Eh?

01:29.339 --> 01:31.575
<i>I'm pretty sure I know
what you're thinking,</i>

01:31.608 --> 01:34.879
<i>and if I wasn't concentrating
so hard on what to do next,</i>

01:34.912 --> 01:37.314
<i>I'd be thinking
the same thing.</i>

01:38.582 --> 01:41.485
<i>How the hell did we
end up in this mess?</i>

01:41.819 --> 01:43.320
<i>Good question.</i>

01:51.394 --> 01:52.730
<i>This is where it all started.</i>

01:53.731 --> 01:56.734
<i>It was a simple job,
just pick up a cake.</i>

01:58.703 --> 02:02.472
<i>But me and Marv,
we had big ideas.</i>

02:04.909 --> 02:07.812
We've got his cake.
That's all we had to do, right?

02:10.715 --> 02:12.049
I think we should do it.

02:12.083 --> 02:14.952
- What, bail?
- Nah. This.

02:15.119 --> 02:16.821
Don't you think?

02:16.854 --> 02:20.892
Nah, yeah, bro, like I said,
we're here now, so...

02:20.925 --> 02:22.059
Exactly.

02:23.194 --> 02:26.931
When we pull off maybe
a couple of others like this,

02:27.430 --> 02:29.499
he has to take notice of us.

02:29.533 --> 02:31.368
This is how we get a rep.

02:31.401 --> 02:34.939
And then we, like, move on up
to the real money, bro.

02:34.972 --> 02:38.943
Like, you know, this is how
Barry and Dean got started.

02:38.976 --> 02:41.012
Dude, they get a cut
of whatever they sell.

02:41.045 --> 02:43.647
Fuckers are totally
rolling in it.

02:43.681 --> 02:45.615
That's where we wanna be.

02:45.649 --> 02:46.984
Right?

02:47.018 --> 02:48.485
High on the hog.

02:48.518 --> 02:50.353
Hells yeah, bro.

02:50.387 --> 02:51.722
High on the hog!

02:57.829 --> 02:59.831
<i>Whoa, whoa, hold up.</i>

03:00.031 --> 03:02.532
<i>Actually, when you
really think about it,</i>

03:02.566 --> 03:04.601
<i>this isn't where
it all started.</i>

03:04.634 --> 03:07.038
<i>Check us out
looking all staunch.</i>

03:07.071 --> 03:10.041
<i>Truth is we're about
to shit our pants.</i>

Oh.

03:54.185 --> 03:55.452
- Pizza?
- Awesome.

03:55.485 --> 03:57.021
Cash or card?

03:57.054 --> 03:58.856
Oh, nah, you were more
than 20 minutes,

03:58.890 --> 04:00.557
so that means it's free.

04:01.092 --> 04:04.095
- But I'm not late.
- 21 minutes. Sorry.

04:04.128 --> 04:05.562
No.

04:05.595 --> 04:08.498
But I still don't have it,

04:08.531 --> 04:10.968
so that means you are late,
so... can I...?

04:11.002 --> 04:12.970
<i>Everything OK, hon?</i>

04:14.906 --> 04:17.141
Are you gonna give me
my pizza or what?

04:17.173 --> 04:20.011
Well, it's timed from
order to door.

04:20.043 --> 04:21.779
No money, no pizza.

04:33.891 --> 04:35.458
Stop doing that.
I don't like it.

04:35.492 --> 04:37.527
- What?
- Fuck off, you perv.

04:37.560 --> 04:39.664
Whoa, bro, I'm not
doing anything to you.

04:39.697 --> 04:41.732
You're undressing me
with your eyes.

04:42.934 --> 04:44.201
<i>What's going on, babe?
I'm hungry.</i>

04:44.235 --> 04:46.603
He's undressing me
with his eyes.

04:47.104 --> 04:49.674
- That's not cool, brother.
- Hey.

04:49.707 --> 04:51.976
Can I just get my $19.50,
please?

04:52.009 --> 04:54.444
- He's still doing it.
- He is too.

04:54.979 --> 04:57.949
- You're a little skank!
- I'm not!

04:58.615 --> 05:00.885
He's undressing you now,
babe.

05:00.918 --> 05:02.585
You little tart.

05:02.619 --> 05:05.189
- You're unbelievable!
- Oh, come on.

05:05.222 --> 05:07.024
You know what,
pizza's on me.

05:07.058 --> 05:09.060
Oi!

05:09.093 --> 05:10.061
Get him, babe!

05:10.094 --> 05:12.562
- Get him! Smash him!
- Oi! You little shit!

05:13.864 --> 05:15.498
Oh, meat lovers.

05:16.233 --> 05:18.002
- Hey, get back here!
- Fuck!

05:19.103 --> 05:20.738
OK, oi!

05:20.771 --> 05:21.806
- Leave it!
- Shit!

05:21.839 --> 05:23.074
That's disrespectful!

05:23.107 --> 05:24.008
Come here!

05:24.041 --> 05:25.276
Come here! Come here!

05:25.309 --> 05:27.078
Oh, playing hide and seek?

05:27.111 --> 05:29.046
Hey, unlock the door.

05:29.080 --> 05:31.048
Oi!

05:31.082 --> 05:32.917
<i>C'mon, cuz.</i>

05:32.950 --> 05:34.919
Shit.

05:35.786 --> 05:37.121
Shit.

05:38.588 --> 05:40.157
Hey, boss.

05:40.191 --> 05:41.826
- Eh?
- I can see you.

05:41.859 --> 05:44.862
Nah, nah, nah, he lied
so he didn't have to pay.

05:44.895 --> 05:47.564
Oh, shit!
You prick!

05:47.597 --> 05:49.033
No, not you.

05:49.066 --> 05:50.868
No, I wasn't late.

05:52.169 --> 05:53.270
What noise?

05:53.304 --> 05:56.173
- What, bring in the car?
- Why'd you be like that?!

06:07.284 --> 06:08.618
Hey, Glen.

06:09.720 --> 06:10.988
Is, um...?

06:12.589 --> 06:13.958
Cool.

06:55.632 --> 06:56.967
I'm...

06:57.001 --> 06:58.635
I'm over it, bro.

07:00.938 --> 07:03.908
I work as many hours
as anyone else,

07:05.076 --> 07:08.611
but I'm always broke.
It's all just...

07:10.247 --> 07:11.648
Bullshit.

07:18.422 --> 07:20.324
Now,

07:20.791 --> 07:22.693
we've always said

07:22.927 --> 07:24.829
one day

07:24.862 --> 07:26.864
we'd be high on the hog...

07:28.365 --> 07:30.301
moneys and honeys.

07:31.936 --> 07:33.737
Still can be.

07:33.971 --> 07:35.339
How?

07:38.843 --> 07:40.177
Oh.

07:40.211 --> 07:42.012
Nah.

07:42.046 --> 07:44.181
I'm already in the door,
bro.

07:44.215 --> 07:45.382
You could be too.

07:45.416 --> 07:46.917
Not happening.

07:46.951 --> 07:49.220
Nobody who ever worked
an honest job

07:49.253 --> 07:51.055
ever got high on the hog.

07:51.088 --> 07:54.158
It's been, like,
scientifically proven, bro.

07:54.191 --> 07:55.893
Dude's a player.

07:56.994 --> 07:58.362
The real deal.

08:01.999 --> 08:03.868
So, you know,

08:03.901 --> 08:05.069
just come meet him.

08:58.455 --> 08:59.757
Marvin tells me you've got

08:59.790 --> 09:02.293
previous experience
working in bars.

09:02.326 --> 09:05.095
Freddy and me worked together
in this...

09:07.131 --> 09:08.766
Sorry.

09:08.799 --> 09:11.902
Tell me, why the fuck you
wanna work here for?

09:11.936 --> 09:13.337
Uh...

09:13.370 --> 09:16.373
Well, Marvin said
you paid good, and...

09:17.208 --> 09:18.976
I'm sick of being broke.

09:19.410 --> 09:23.013
And I don't wanna be delivering
pizzas forever.

09:23.047 --> 09:24.415
I want more, you know.

09:31.155 --> 09:33.090
In prison camps

09:34.024 --> 09:36.393
in the American Civil War,

09:37.061 --> 09:39.196
there was a line,

09:40.197 --> 09:42.399
and if a prisoner crossed
that line,

09:43.901 --> 09:45.202
he was shot.

09:46.103 --> 09:48.472
That line was called
a deadline.

09:48.505 --> 09:50.474
I always liked that word.

09:51.475 --> 09:53.177
Deadline.

09:56.046 --> 09:58.082
Meaning's changed since.

09:58.382 --> 10:00.818
But with some deadlines,
there's always a risk

10:00.851 --> 10:02.519
that once you cross over it,

10:03.554 --> 10:05.289
you may never come back.

10:16.300 --> 10:17.501
You want a job?

10:19.503 --> 10:21.171
You convince me.

10:23.974 --> 10:25.909
You got 10 seconds.

10:28.545 --> 10:29.980
Nine.

10:30.014 --> 10:31.148
- Um...
- Eight.

10:31.181 --> 10:32.449
Wait, what do you want
me to do?

10:32.483 --> 10:34.218
Seven.

10:34.251 --> 10:35.586
Six.

10:35.619 --> 10:36.887
Five.

10:36.920 --> 10:38.222
Four.

10:38.255 --> 10:40.457
Three. Two.

10:44.595 --> 10:46.797
Ooh.

10:47.264 --> 10:48.999
One.

10:57.941 --> 10:59.410
Is it loaded, Freddy?

11:00.177 --> 11:01.879
This gun loaded, Freddy?

11:01.912 --> 11:03.113
N-No, no, no!

11:06.417 --> 11:08.252
Pulls a bit to the left.

11:14.425 --> 11:16.427
Something I should know
about you, Freddy?

11:16.460 --> 11:18.395
A pizza guy was

11:18.429 --> 11:20.431
robbed a while back.

11:20.931 --> 11:22.466
So now I use that...

11:22.499 --> 11:24.001
as protection.

11:26.503 --> 11:28.205
It's my dad's.

11:29.073 --> 11:30.974
Does he know
that you've got it?

11:35.346 --> 11:36.447
Nah.

11:36.480 --> 11:39.316
You stole your old man's gun?

11:41.051 --> 11:42.186
Well,

11:42.219 --> 11:43.554
it was,...

11:43.587 --> 11:46.490
you know,
left to me, so...

11:47.257 --> 11:49.626
He got, like, attacked

11:49.661 --> 11:51.061
on the job.

11:52.096 --> 11:53.530
He drove cabs.

11:54.198 --> 11:55.299
Attacked?

11:56.433 --> 11:58.268
Stabbed, actually.

12:10.114 --> 12:12.116
You know, I think there
might be a place for you

12:12.149 --> 12:13.951
and your little gun

12:14.985 --> 12:17.388
in this fine
establishment of mine.

12:18.555 --> 12:20.023
What do you say?

12:24.027 --> 12:26.063
<i>Right here.
Pretty safe to say that</i>

12:26.096 --> 12:28.298
<i>right here is where
the whole mess began.</i>

12:28.332 --> 12:30.367
<i>I should have said,
"Can I think about it?"</i>

12:30.401 --> 12:33.404
<i>But I wanted into that world,
so I was all like,...</i>

12:33.437 --> 12:35.105

13:02.466 --> 13:04.201
No way.

13:04.234 --> 13:06.270
- Why not?
- It's a shit idea.

13:06.303 --> 13:08.238
Let's just stick to the plan,
OK?

13:08.272 --> 13:10.140
Let's go. Open it.

13:10.574 --> 13:12.209
Is that a flare gun?

13:13.177 --> 13:14.111
N-No.

13:14.746 --> 13:15.713
Open it.

13:16.781 --> 13:18.449
Wait, wait, wait.
Wait, nah, nah.

13:18.482 --> 13:19.483
- Nah, hold on.
- What are you doing?

13:19.516 --> 13:22.085
Put it up.
We can't show weakness.

13:22.386 --> 13:24.321
Bro, how much
is in the till?

13:25.522 --> 13:27.257
Three-hundred cash,
give or take.

13:27.291 --> 13:29.193
And how much is in that?

13:29.661 --> 13:32.062
Thousands.
Maybe tens of thousands.

13:33.330 --> 13:35.700
See, bro,
tens of thousands.

13:35.733 --> 13:37.634
Rob the ATM?

13:39.203 --> 13:40.137
How?

13:42.740 --> 13:45.509
- Can you open it?
- Only the security company can.

13:45.542 --> 13:47.044
Let's just take
the three-hundy.

13:47.077 --> 13:48.579
Bro, why settle for peanuts

13:48.612 --> 13:51.148
when we can just rip
it out of the wall?

13:51.181 --> 13:52.684
- Dude, you can't.
- Yeah, you can.

13:52.717 --> 13:55.352
YouTube...
I've seen these epic fails

13:55.385 --> 13:58.589
with dudes trying to do it,
and... it just can't be done.

13:58.622 --> 14:00.792
Yeah, but did they
have a Sharon?

14:00.825 --> 14:03.160
- What?
- The Shazza.

14:04.762 --> 14:06.029
Oh, the...

14:07.197 --> 14:08.332
That's the second
dumbest idea

14:08.365 --> 14:09.466
you've ever had.

14:10.434 --> 14:12.169
- Listen to me, man.
- Seriously, bro.

14:12.202 --> 14:13.537
- Look...
- Seriously!

14:13.570 --> 14:15.239
- One scratch on her...
- Oh, bro, it's OK.

14:15.272 --> 14:16.507
- ...he'll kill us!
- It's OK!

14:16.540 --> 14:18.743
- No fucking way in hell!
- That's...

14:19.443 --> 14:21.813
Whatever damage
we do to the Sharon,

14:21.846 --> 14:24.147
we can fix
using the ATM cash.

14:24.782 --> 14:27.417
And think about it,
what's gonna impress him more...

14:27.451 --> 14:31.054
robbing a place like this
or robbing a bank?

14:31.355 --> 14:32.657
Kind of.

14:35.092 --> 14:36.661
And, dude,

14:36.694 --> 14:38.262
you can put your
hands down now.

14:39.731 --> 14:42.199
- You got a family?
- Yes.

14:42.232 --> 14:43.701
- Kids?
- Six.

14:43.735 --> 14:45.737
- Damn!
- Seriously?

14:46.236 --> 14:47.371
Wow.

14:47.805 --> 14:50.207
And, what,
if we steal from you,

14:50.240 --> 14:53.210
they'll be left with nothing
but 2 Minute Noodles, right?

14:53.243 --> 14:54.511
Noodles if they're lucky.

14:54.545 --> 14:57.314
See, bro?
Think of the kids.

14:58.215 --> 15:00.050
Oh man.

15:02.452 --> 15:04.321
- Fine.
- Yes!

15:04.354 --> 15:06.490
But I'm not leaving without
that crazy elephant.

15:13.330 --> 15:15.667
- Dude, stop! The cake!
- Huh?

15:15.800 --> 15:17.134
<i>The cake!</i>

15:17.568 --> 15:18.770
Oh, yeah.

15:33.216 --> 15:35.218
Dude, we've gotta go.

15:35.519 --> 15:36.688
We gotta go now!

15:36.721 --> 15:37.755
Yeah, yeah, hang on.

15:37.789 --> 15:41.425
What do you think this
looks like, a pool party?

15:41.826 --> 15:44.094
<i>They'll be calling the cops</i>

15:44.461 --> 15:46.396
right now!

15:58.342 --> 15:59.610
Oh, fuck.

15:59.643 --> 16:02.245
- One more time!
- <i>We gotta go, dude.</i>

16:07.217 --> 16:09.186
One more time!
One more time!

16:10.554 --> 16:11.889
Hey, whoa.

16:11.923 --> 16:13.190
What are you doing?
I've got this.

16:13.223 --> 16:14.157
No, you don't.

16:14.993 --> 16:16.627
What? Well,
what about the money?

16:16.661 --> 16:17.494
Fuck the money.

16:17.527 --> 16:19.296
Then how are we gonna
fix the Sharon?

16:19.329 --> 16:21.766
We?
This was your idea, bro.

16:21.799 --> 16:24.267
I told you!
YouTube, dude!

16:24.534 --> 16:26.536
YouTube!

16:26.838 --> 16:28.840
Bro, bro, bro.

16:28.873 --> 16:30.607
Stop! The cake, bro.
The cake.

16:30.641 --> 16:32.542
Oh, shit.

16:34.712 --> 16:35.847
Whoa, whoa.

16:49.559 --> 16:51.528
Glory to Ganesha!

16:52.229 --> 16:55.432
Yeah, don't fuck in my
neighborhood, you bastards.

17:03.340 --> 17:04.709
An ATM.

17:05.843 --> 17:07.444
Don't you watch YouTube?

17:09.681 --> 17:11.381
Let's recap, shall we?

17:13.818 --> 17:16.353
You have, A, wrecked my car

17:16.619 --> 17:18.890
and, B, wrecked my cake,

17:19.321 --> 17:23.193
which means that you have, C,
wrecked my birthday.

17:25.295 --> 17:27.196
Could get another cake.

17:28.298 --> 17:29.499
Freddy,

17:29.533 --> 17:32.904
dozens of my friends are in
there celebrating my birthday.

17:32.937 --> 17:34.939
Where am I gonna get
a cake at this hour that's

17:34.972 --> 17:40.277
big enough so that each of them
can get a nice fat slice?

17:40.377 --> 17:42.914
Well, instead of
getting one cake,

17:42.947 --> 17:44.682
you could...

17:44.716 --> 17:46.751
- get a few cakes.
- Dude.

17:47.719 --> 17:49.619
What, the supermarket's
still open.

17:51.421 --> 17:52.990
Supermarket cakes?

17:53.623 --> 17:55.559
Marvin and me can go
and get them.

17:55.592 --> 17:57.962
That cake took
days to make,

17:57.995 --> 18:00.597
and it cost me more money
than you've probably made

18:00.630 --> 18:03.600
in your entire worthless
fucking life.

18:06.738 --> 18:09.372
It was a spectacular cake,
don't you think?

18:11.541 --> 18:13.711
Now I can't enjoy that cake.

18:13.745 --> 18:15.947
Now I can't blow out
the candles

18:15.980 --> 18:18.615
and I can't make a wish.

18:19.516 --> 18:21.551
Guess what my wish
was gonna be.

18:22.619 --> 18:24.454
A new car?

18:34.598 --> 18:35.867
No.
We'll make it up to you.

18:35.900 --> 18:37.567
Work-Work for free until we

18:37.601 --> 18:40.437
pay you back what we owe
for the cake and the Sharon.

18:43.440 --> 18:46.811
I can't go back to my old job,
I don't want that life.

18:46.844 --> 18:49.513
That was my dad's life,
and he worked heaps

18:49.546 --> 18:51.749
and did everything right,

18:52.850 --> 18:54.451
and look where it got him.

18:55.385 --> 18:57.487
We wanna show you
what we're made of.

18:57.521 --> 19:00.658
Give us something
more than... than just...

19:00.691 --> 19:02.292
picking up a cake.

19:18.642 --> 19:22.914
You know why I came to this city
at the ass end of nowhere?

19:22.947 --> 19:23.981
Love.

19:27.084 --> 19:28.585
That's my wife.

19:31.756 --> 19:34.091
- She's pretty.
- She's a whore.

19:39.664 --> 19:40.630
- Oh.
- Eh?

19:40.665 --> 19:42.066
She broke her vows.

19:43.633 --> 19:44.168
Yeah!

19:44.202 --> 19:46.003
Marriage is sacred...

19:47.604 --> 19:48.706
sanctified,

19:48.739 --> 19:50.708
and she shat all over that.

19:50.741 --> 19:53.343
She went around
screwing some...

19:53.678 --> 19:56.379
prick called Donny Kong.

20:04.789 --> 20:06.556
I want Donny dead.

20:07.792 --> 20:08.759
Dead.

20:08.893 --> 20:09.660
Dead!

20:09.694 --> 20:12.529
Dead! Dead! Dead!
Fucking dead!

20:15.166 --> 20:16.667
Fair enough.

20:17.935 --> 20:21.538
Now, I could get Barry
and Dean here

20:21.571 --> 20:23.540
to take care of it for me.

20:23.573 --> 20:26.409
But why should they
get their hands dirty

20:26.443 --> 20:27.845
when I've got the two of you

20:27.879 --> 20:30.580
with a sweet little
debt to pay?

20:30.848 --> 20:34.384
And you did just say
you wanted to do something more.

20:35.887 --> 20:37.755
Freddy,

20:37.788 --> 20:39.456
what am I saying?

20:42.827 --> 20:44.729
What am I saying?

20:46.097 --> 20:47.832
That you, uh...

20:48.699 --> 20:50.668
you want Donny Kong,
like...

20:50.701 --> 20:51.969
dead?

20:52.703 --> 20:54.071
Marvin,

20:54.105 --> 20:56.207
what else am I saying?

20:56.240 --> 20:57.675
That...

20:58.575 --> 21:00.011
you want us...

21:00.878 --> 21:02.545
to kill him.

21:06.616 --> 21:09.153
Now, Barry and Dean
will give you the address

21:09.186 --> 21:11.188
and anything else
you might need,

21:11.222 --> 21:12.990
and you'll do this by...

21:14.191 --> 21:15.960
noon tomorrow.

21:18.095 --> 21:19.664
High noon.

21:19.964 --> 21:23.433
Yeah, I like that.
That's a good deadline.

21:24.567 --> 21:25.970
Dramatic.

21:28.839 --> 21:31.108
Let me be crystal
fucking clear.

21:31.876 --> 21:32.810
You don't do this,

21:32.843 --> 21:35.112
and I'll have the boys here
give each of you

21:35.146 --> 21:36.881
a permanent limp...

21:37.514 --> 21:39.016
in both legs.

21:41.152 --> 21:42.853
Probably worse.

21:44.021 --> 21:47.191
But you do do this,
and we'll be all square.

21:47.557 --> 21:49.459
Square as a bear.

21:50.661 --> 21:52.129
So what's it gonna be?

21:52.697 --> 21:54.065
Square as a bear...

21:55.232 --> 21:56.867
or permanent limp?

21:58.903 --> 22:03.573
<i>Is that even possible?
To have a limp in both legs?</i>

22:03.874 --> 22:05.743
We are so fucked.

22:06.077 --> 22:07.244
Wouldn't...

22:09.046 --> 22:10.681
one limp, like,

22:11.614 --> 22:12.883
cancel out the other?

22:12.917 --> 22:14.919
Bro, we don't do this

22:15.618 --> 22:17.520
and we're in some deep shit.

22:17.554 --> 22:19.957
Maybe we just talk
to this Donny dude,

22:19.991 --> 22:21.624
make him see reason,

22:22.994 --> 22:24.228
tell him why we're there

22:24.261 --> 22:26.529
and Spiggs knows
what's going on,

22:26.563 --> 22:29.532
so if he doesn't skip town,

22:29.566 --> 22:31.202
then he's a dead man.

22:31.568 --> 22:32.937
He disappears,

22:32.970 --> 22:36.207
we go back and tell Spiggs
we took care of him...

22:36.240 --> 22:37.908
all good.

22:41.846 --> 22:43.646
We could, like,

22:43.681 --> 22:45.615
break down the door

22:45.648 --> 22:48.185
and, like, put a gun in
his face and be, like,

22:48.219 --> 22:52.690
"Bro, leave town
or we're gonna fuck you up!"

22:56.193 --> 22:57.928
Yeah, nah.

23:10.875 --> 23:12.609
You know what he'd say,
don't you?

23:15.079 --> 23:17.114
"Where's my fucking beer,
boys?"

23:18.315 --> 23:20.251
"Straight and narrow, son."

23:21.085 --> 23:22.686
"Straight and narrow."

23:32.263 --> 23:33.898
Wanna end up like Glen?

23:34.932 --> 23:37.168
Breaking your back
for fuck all?

23:38.702 --> 23:42.039
This Donny dude is rooting
the boss' missus.

23:43.074 --> 23:44.708
And you heard Spiggs.

23:45.743 --> 23:47.778
Marriage is sanctimonious.

23:48.412 --> 23:51.115
We sort this Donny dude
for Spiggs

23:52.016 --> 23:55.686
and we'll be straight up
set for good, bro.

23:57.922 --> 23:59.824
High on the hog.

24:52.276 --> 24:53.944
Um.

24:53.978 --> 24:56.780
Do we... Do we knock or,
like...

24:57.047 --> 24:59.884
bust the door down
and then take him by surprise?

24:59.917 --> 25:02.019
What if we knock
and when he opens up,

25:02.052 --> 25:05.789
we, like, force our way in
and, you know,...

25:06.090 --> 25:07.992
take it from there?

28:26.256 --> 28:28.425
Three, two,

28:28.959 --> 28:30.027
one.

28:31.061 --> 28:32.996
<i>And so the guards
threw down their weapons</i>

28:33.030 --> 28:34.932
- <i>and the children put aside...</i>
- Shoot him, bro.

28:34.965 --> 28:36.967
You shoot him.

28:37.568 --> 28:38.869
It's a flare gun.

28:48.445 --> 28:49.213
Shoot him!

28:49.246 --> 28:51.281
Let him go!
I'll shoot you, bro!

28:51.315 --> 28:51.949
I mean it.

28:51.982 --> 28:54.418
- With my gun!
- Oh. Fuck!

28:54.451 --> 28:57.154
<i>♪ We want you to see... ♪</i>

28:59.657 --> 29:02.192
<i>♪ See the world ♪</i>

29:03.327 --> 29:06.330
<i>♪ see all the beauty

29:08.198 --> 29:10.367

29:13.738 --> 29:15.506

29:18.041 --> 29:20.043
Oh!

29:28.018 --> 29:29.620
What happened?

29:29.654 --> 29:31.488
Is he dead?

29:32.156 --> 29:33.590
- Looks it.
- Oh!

29:33.624 --> 29:37.027
He could have that thing,
where you, like,

29:37.060 --> 29:39.396
suddenly fall asleep.
You know?

29:40.397 --> 29:42.199
Narcoleprosy.

29:42.734 --> 29:44.234
Hey!

29:44.268 --> 29:45.469
Dude.

29:45.502 --> 29:47.037
Hello?

29:47.070 --> 29:48.038
It's all good.

29:51.341 --> 29:53.010
He ain't sleeping, bro.

29:56.781 --> 29:58.315
Oh.

30:09.460 --> 30:11.462
Am I surprised?

30:11.628 --> 30:13.430
Actually, yes.

30:13.731 --> 30:15.566
Yes, I am.

30:17.568 --> 30:19.102
To be honest,

30:19.136 --> 30:22.306
I was sure that if anyone
was gonna fuck this up

30:22.339 --> 30:24.441
and get themselves killed,

30:24.475 --> 30:26.343
it was you two.

30:28.545 --> 30:32.349
Yeah, let's view this as
a kind of initiation, huh?

30:35.052 --> 30:36.553
A toast...

30:36.587 --> 30:39.022
to Donny's demise!

30:45.529 --> 30:50.000
Let's see that skinny little
fuck fuck my missus now.

30:50.668 --> 30:52.369
Mr Spiggs,

30:52.402 --> 30:55.405
did you just call
Donny Kong skinny

30:55.740 --> 30:58.108
in the same way you might
call Marvin brainy?

31:00.177 --> 31:01.512
What do you mean?

31:01.545 --> 31:03.580
- He was fat.
- What?

31:03.681 --> 31:05.549
Yeah, like, really fat.

31:07.351 --> 31:09.353
Oh, you shot a fat man?

31:11.789 --> 31:13.791
Are you guys fucking with me,
are you?

31:13.825 --> 31:16.728
Huh? Are you guys
fucking with me, eh?!

31:21.098 --> 31:22.499
Oh, fuck!

31:22.533 --> 31:23.634
Maybe, you know,

31:23.668 --> 31:25.536
Donny porked out
since you last saw him.

31:25.569 --> 31:28.171
Wh-Wh-What he just ballooned
overnight, huh?

31:28.205 --> 31:31.241
Magically beat the fuck
out of his anorexia!

31:31.275 --> 31:32.744
You guys shot the wrong man,
didn't you?!

31:32.777 --> 31:35.412
- Technically, he died before...
- Before you what?

31:35.445 --> 31:36.547
We didn't actually shoot him.

31:36.580 --> 31:38.482
You just said
that you fucking did.

31:38.515 --> 31:40.083
We just wanted you
to like us.

31:40.117 --> 31:41.518
We think it was
a heart attack,

31:41.552 --> 31:43.186
probably because of his size.

31:43.220 --> 31:45.790
- And the situation.
- Yeah. The sitch.

31:55.532 --> 31:57.534
Whoa, whoa!

32:02.573 --> 32:04.575
Come here,
you little fucks!

32:13.650 --> 32:15.485
Fuck it.

32:35.873 --> 32:38.141
- Where are you going, bro?
- It's OK.

32:38.375 --> 32:41.378
Bro, where are you going?
Bro, come back.

32:43.280 --> 32:44.548
I'm sorry.

32:45.582 --> 32:48.820
Did you do anything
or say anything to anybody

32:48.853 --> 32:51.421
that would make it
even remotely possible

32:51.455 --> 32:55.325
to trace what happened
to the fat man back to me?

32:55.359 --> 32:57.361
Probably not.

32:57.662 --> 32:59.664
"Probably not."

33:00.631 --> 33:02.900
That's very reassuring, son.

33:02.934 --> 33:04.869
Nobody saw us, Mr Spiggs.

33:08.505 --> 33:11.508
Go back, get a name
for the fat man.

33:11.608 --> 33:14.177
Then I want you
to find Donny Kong

33:14.211 --> 33:15.813
and finish the job.

33:17.547 --> 33:19.416
You got it?

33:19.784 --> 33:21.686
Of course, yeah.

33:22.352 --> 33:24.388
Until I have a name
for the fat man

33:24.421 --> 33:27.825
and Donny is picking turnips
with a stepladder,

33:27.859 --> 33:29.927
then we're not square
as a bear.

33:29.961 --> 33:32.897
Why would... Why would Donny
be picking turnips?

33:32.930 --> 33:34.231
Dead, Freddy!
Dead!

33:34.264 --> 33:35.867
Cos he'd be fucking dead!

33:36.633 --> 33:37.935
Wait.

33:41.673 --> 33:43.675
You...

33:45.977 --> 33:50.313
<i>Now, as you know, Freddy,
the deadline's still noon.</i>

33:50.347 --> 33:53.383
<i>If you're not back by then,
I shoot Marvin's foot.</i>

33:54.284 --> 33:56.654
<i>Then every half hour
past noon,</i>

33:57.021 --> 33:58.522
<i>I'll shoot him again.</i>

33:59.589 --> 34:01.458
<i>I'll start with the other foot,</i>

34:01.491 --> 34:02.960
<i>work my way up to his knees...</i>

34:04.261 --> 34:06.263
<i>...his hands, and then...</i>

34:06.463 --> 34:07.699
<i>...ugh...</i>

34:08.598 --> 34:10.735
<i>...I'm sure you
get the picture.</i>

34:17.675 --> 34:20.476
I think he's in room 202,
but I'm not too sure.

34:20.510 --> 34:22.746
Maybe you've got a register
with his name in it.

34:22.780 --> 34:24.214
You a cop?

34:25.382 --> 34:26.650
I'm not a cop, really.

34:26.684 --> 34:28.753
- Are you sure you're not a cop?
- I'm not.

34:28.786 --> 34:30.888
- Cos you sound like a cop.
- I'm not.

34:30.922 --> 34:31.822
OK, well,
if you're not a cop,

34:31.856 --> 34:34.491
then why should I tell you
if your friend,

34:34.524 --> 34:37.027
if, in fact, he is your friend,
is in room 202?

34:37.061 --> 34:38.495
Is your mum
or dad here or...?

34:38.527 --> 34:40.563
- What's your friend's name?
- Um...

34:40.597 --> 34:42.699
His name.
Um...

34:42.734 --> 34:44.266
Funny thing is...

34:44.902 --> 34:47.337
I've actually forgotten
his name.

34:47.370 --> 34:48.706
Oh, right.

34:48.739 --> 34:50.908
B-B-But he's...
He's really large.

34:50.942 --> 34:51.842
Asian, I think.

34:51.876 --> 34:53.911
So you don't know
if your friend's Asian

34:53.945 --> 34:55.045
and you can't
remember his name?

34:55.079 --> 34:57.347
Room 202.
It's just a name.

34:57.782 --> 34:58.983
What's that say?

34:59.784 --> 35:02.486
- Do you know what it means?
- Um...

35:38.122 --> 35:39.924
Hello? Donny?

35:39.957 --> 35:42.960
Hello?

35:44.494 --> 35:46.329
<i>...We import
so much of our food,</i>

35:46.363 --> 35:47.965
<i>and all the time,
it's got to come up from the</i>

35:47.999 --> 35:50.367
<i>Northern Hemisphere; it's gotta
come from the warmer climates,</i>

35:50.400 --> 35:52.003
<i>cos we're not very good
at growing stuff.</i>

36:18.896 --> 36:22.332
<i>Police.
Open the door, please.</i>

36:22.900 --> 36:25.335
<i>Open the door.</i>

36:26.003 --> 36:28.005
Uh, just a second.

36:41.686 --> 36:44.554
Sorry. It was just kind of mess,
so...

36:44.856 --> 36:47.058
We got a call that someone
matching your description

36:47.091 --> 36:48.960
- broke in here.
- I didn't actually break in.

36:48.993 --> 36:50.761
Jeff left the door
open for me.

36:50.795 --> 36:52.395
Who the hell is Jeff?

36:52.429 --> 36:54.866
Jeff Kwok.
We're hooking up today.

36:54.899 --> 36:56.067
And he said to wait
here for him.

36:56.100 --> 36:58.102
He's lying. I've never
heard of Jeff Kwok.

36:58.135 --> 37:01.504
Yeah, Jeff knows Donny,
and he's staying here.

37:01.538 --> 37:04.041
I think that's actually
his suitcase over there.

37:04.075 --> 37:05.142
What's your name?

37:07.078 --> 37:08.779
Uh, Calvin...

37:09.446 --> 37:10.781
Broadus.

37:11.581 --> 37:13.050
People call me Snoop.

37:13.718 --> 37:15.720
Got some ID, Snoop?

37:17.922 --> 37:19.623
- Sorry, no.
- Oh, this is bullshit!

37:19.657 --> 37:20.658
OK, calm down.

37:20.691 --> 37:22.592
He told me that he didn't
know who lives here,

37:22.626 --> 37:24.695
and he asked me for a name!

37:24.729 --> 37:26.764
I'll take it from here, OK?

37:41.645 --> 37:43.480
Is someone in there?

37:43.513 --> 37:46.117
Oh, uh, I don't...
I don't think so.

37:46.483 --> 37:48.185
Actually, I wouldn't
go in there.

37:48.219 --> 37:51.055
I just did a monster shit,
and it's like...

37:51.722 --> 37:53.423
Whoa.

38:02.599 --> 38:04.902
When do you expect
your friend to get back?

38:10.808 --> 38:12.677
Uh, soon.

38:12.977 --> 38:14.979
Maybe you should
wait outside.

38:39.136 --> 38:41.504
Shit!

38:44.041 --> 38:46.043
Fuck.

39:13.570 --> 39:15.139
- It's clean?
- Definitely.

39:18.109 --> 39:19.944
So you tidied up

39:19.977 --> 39:23.147
and you wiped clean
everything we touched?

39:23.180 --> 39:25.249
What do you think
"definitely" means?

39:25.282 --> 39:28.219
Yeah, I cleaned up and tidied
everything we touched,

39:28.252 --> 39:31.255
just like your highness ordered,
so can we get fucking moving?

39:31.288 --> 39:33.090
Because the skipper's waiting,

39:33.124 --> 39:35.092
and she doesn't like
to be kept waiting.

39:35.126 --> 39:36.827
Fucking knew I should
have done it myself.

39:37.995 --> 39:39.663
Do I look like
a fucking idiot?

39:40.297 --> 39:41.799
You treat me
like a fucking idiot,

39:41.832 --> 39:43.200
and I don't like it.

39:43.834 --> 39:45.635
- You don't like it?
- I do not.

39:45.669 --> 39:47.271
You know,
there's a saying...

39:47.304 --> 39:49.874
you teach people
how to treat you.

39:49.907 --> 39:51.008
What?!

39:51.042 --> 39:53.310
Who's "they"?

39:53.344 --> 39:55.545
It's just what they say.

39:56.247 --> 39:58.215
Fuck!

39:58.749 --> 39:59.884
Fucking shit.

40:02.920 --> 40:04.221
Jesus...

40:04.255 --> 40:06.791
What the fuck
are you waiting for?!

40:06.824 --> 40:10.094
- Calm the fuck down.
- Come on, man!

40:10.127 --> 40:11.962
Those cops are gonna ask us
fucking questions,

40:11.996 --> 40:14.899
and it's gonna fucking blow up
in our faces like fucking C4.

40:14.932 --> 40:16.100
And the skip won't be happy.
She won't be.

40:16.133 --> 40:17.234
- Fuck!
- Roy.

40:17.268 --> 40:19.602
- Won't be happy, okay.
- OK, it's all good, all right?

40:19.636 --> 40:21.105
OK, just use your breathing.

40:21.138 --> 40:23.640
Use your breathing.

40:23.674 --> 40:25.642
There, you happy?

40:25.676 --> 40:27.978
Yeah. Yeah,
I'm fucking happy!

40:28.012 --> 40:29.814
Breathing. Breathing.

40:29.847 --> 40:31.048
Here we go.

40:34.118 --> 40:35.119
Chill, dog.

40:35.953 --> 40:37.154
Chill, dog.

40:37.188 --> 40:39.190
- "Chill, dog"?
- What?

40:40.191 --> 40:42.726
- Who says that any more?
- Everyone.

40:43.994 --> 40:45.796
- Brolax.
- What?

40:47.031 --> 40:49.333
You know, "brolax".
It's like the new "chill dog".

40:49.366 --> 40:52.203
You know, but instead
of "chill dog",

40:52.236 --> 40:55.272
you've got bro and relax.
You put it together... brolax.

40:55.306 --> 40:56.707
- Brolax?
- Mm.

40:57.141 --> 40:58.075

How can someone be

44:49.540 --> 44:50.341
He's dead.

44:50.374 --> 44:52.910
You know, he's...
definitely dead.

44:53.610 --> 44:57.381
<i>There was just no signs
of a break-in or a struggle,</i>

44:57.414 --> 44:59.917
so we figured, you know...

45:00.351 --> 45:01.585
heart attack?

45:01.618 --> 45:05.155
Yeah, I mean, a body of those
proportions, you know, it was...

45:05.189 --> 45:07.057
What?

45:07.091 --> 45:07.925
Roy had a hunch.

45:07.958 --> 45:10.394
Here's my hunch.
This is what happened.

45:10.427 --> 45:13.665
He ate it, and then he tries to
shit it out in the bath, right?

45:13.698 --> 45:15.165
Because if he tried
to shit it out in the toilet,

45:15.199 --> 45:16.567
it would go down
the drain, right?

45:16.600 --> 45:18.602
So while he's trying to
shit it out in the bath,

45:18.635 --> 45:21.605
the strain was so big that,

45:21.638 --> 45:23.474
boom, heart attack!

45:24.641 --> 45:26.610
Jeff ate the merchandise?

45:26.643 --> 45:28.145
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

45:28.345 --> 45:30.481
So it's still inside him,
and we need to cut it out.

45:30.514 --> 45:32.649
No fucking way
I'm cutting him up.

45:33.317 --> 45:35.052
Which leaves...

45:35.352 --> 45:36.520
well, just you.

45:36.553 --> 45:37.955
- Me?
- Hmm.

45:37.988 --> 45:39.390
- I saw a meat clever...
- Hey, whoa, whoa.

45:39.423 --> 45:40.958
- Oh, what?
- A meat clever?

45:40.991 --> 45:42.159
Yeah.

45:43.193 --> 45:45.195
- Yeah.
- What?

45:46.731 --> 45:48.365
W-We can't do it here

45:48.399 --> 45:51.001
cos of forensics
and whatnot.

45:51.669 --> 45:54.571
- Which is why...
- Oh God no.

45:55.105 --> 45:57.241
- We take him to the workshop.
- Right.

45:57.274 --> 45:59.243
And we let the skip do it.

46:00.745 --> 46:03.347
- He's in the van.
- Oh, is he?

46:03.380 --> 46:07.384
We dressed him in a tracksuit
so nothing looked suspicious.

46:07.418 --> 46:09.186
Hmm.
Tell me, Roy,

46:09.219 --> 46:11.155
the room you found him in,

46:11.188 --> 46:12.990
what floor was it on?

46:13.424 --> 46:15.092
- First.
- First.

46:15.125 --> 46:17.662
- Oh, so there were stairs?
- Yep.

46:18.061 --> 46:19.463
And where did you park?

46:19.496 --> 46:22.366
Uh, on the street
outside the motel.

46:22.734 --> 46:24.435
Oh, I see.

46:24.468 --> 46:28.172
So, let's just recreate this
morning's events, shall we?

46:28.205 --> 46:31.341
So you find Jeff dead
in the bathroom,

46:31.676 --> 46:33.644
<i>and you put him in
a tracksuit,</i>

46:34.478 --> 46:36.346
then you carry him

46:36.380 --> 46:39.550
<i>down some stairs
and on to a public street,</i>

46:40.551 --> 46:43.053
and you put him
in the van.

46:44.789 --> 46:46.623
And all this
takes place when?

46:47.424 --> 46:49.359
Oh, it was early-ish, eh.

46:49.393 --> 46:51.228
In broad fucking daylight!

46:51.261 --> 46:55.098
And then you drive a body
the size of a small whale

46:55.132 --> 46:56.567
around the city

46:56.600 --> 46:59.403
and you leave him
parked in a van

46:59.503 --> 47:01.673
outside my shop.

47:02.105 --> 47:05.743
But nothing looks suspicious,
does it?

47:11.615 --> 47:14.451
I-I-It's so nice
to see you brolax.

47:14.485 --> 47:16.553
What did you say?

47:16.587 --> 47:18.055
- Don't.
- Brolax.

47:18.088 --> 47:20.090
It's like when you're
a brother relaxing,

47:20.123 --> 47:22.292
- and you just take out the...
- Are you on fucking meth?!

47:22.326 --> 47:24.194
No, not today.

47:28.298 --> 47:30.300
All right, bring him in.

47:33.504 --> 47:34.739

48:00.330 --> 48:02.366
Roy, when did you decide
it was acceptable

48:02.399 --> 48:04.268
to call me Skip?

48:04.301 --> 48:06.771
What, so that doesn't
get your freak on?

48:06.804 --> 48:09.239
- My "freak on"?
- Yeah.

48:09.640 --> 48:11.408
I assume that means you
think I would like it,

48:11.441 --> 48:13.310
but no,
I do not like it.

48:13.544 --> 48:15.412
Bum-lickers don't impress me.

48:15.813 --> 48:17.614

49:11.803 --> 49:12.904
Well, gentlemen,

49:12.937 --> 49:15.673
the merchandise
is not in the fat man.

49:16.473 --> 49:17.641
Which means what?

49:18.308 --> 49:19.443
It's somewhere else.

49:19.576 --> 49:20.712
It's somewhere else.

49:20.745 --> 49:23.480
That is correct.
Well done, Semo.

49:23.513 --> 49:24.816
But where?

49:26.316 --> 49:28.418
- Good question.
- Good question?

49:28.820 --> 49:30.788
Not a good question?

49:30.822 --> 49:33.490
No, Roy, that's not
a good question.

49:33.858 --> 49:36.526
That is an outstanding question.

49:36.560 --> 49:39.630
That is the best
fucking question

49:39.664 --> 49:41.365
on the entire fucking planet.

49:41.398 --> 49:43.634
That is the fucking
"to be or not to be"

49:43.668 --> 49:46.203
of fucking questions,
and I want it fucking answered,

49:46.236 --> 49:47.872
so get back to that
fucking motel,

49:47.905 --> 49:49.473
and you fucking rip
that place apart,

49:49.506 --> 49:50.808
and you don't fucking stop

49:50.842 --> 49:54.177
until you find my
fucking merchandise!

50:01.986 --> 50:03.788
Why couldn't you just
have eaten it

50:03.821 --> 50:06.390
like you clearly eat
everything else?

50:29.246 --> 50:30.815
<i>You think about a lot
of things when you're</i>

50:30.848 --> 50:33.216
<i>trapped under a bed
in a motel room</i>

50:33.250 --> 50:34.886
<i>with a guy who
might want to kill you</i>

50:34.919 --> 50:36.788
<i>if he found out you were
there to kill him</i>

50:36.821 --> 50:38.522
<i>for screwing your boss' wife.</i>

50:38.555 --> 50:40.758
All kinds of stuff...
random stuff,

50:40.792 --> 50:44.862
<i>like what I'd do differently
if I coached the Warriors.</i>

50:44.896 --> 50:46.731
<i>Other stuff too,</i>

50:46.764 --> 50:48.365
<i>like my dad,</i>

50:48.398 --> 50:50.400
<i>who didn't deserve to die,</i>

50:50.735 --> 50:52.904
<i>and what he might
say right now.</i>

50:53.771 --> 50:55.539
<i>Something like,</i>

50:55.940 --> 51:00.210
<i>"You made a mistake, son,
getting involved with Spiggs."</i>

51:01.311 --> 51:02.814
<i>And then he'd hug me</i>

51:03.613 --> 51:05.582
<i>and tell me he loved me.</i>

51:06.550 --> 51:10.520
<i>Then I thought about the time
and the high noon thing,</i>

51:10.554 --> 51:12.824
<i>and the deadline and how
I needed to do this for Marvin,</i>

51:12.857 --> 51:14.692
<i>who was always there for me.</i>

51:16.761 --> 51:18.562
<i>And I thought,</i>

51:18.595 --> 51:20.898
<i>"Yeah,
Dad would understand."</i>

51:22.399 --> 51:23.935
<i>But then I was all like,</i>

51:24.401 --> 51:26.603
<i>"Man, this is really confusing."</i>

51:27.071 --> 51:29.339
<i>The only thing I could
think to do next was</i>

51:29.372 --> 51:31.308
<i>pray for a miracle.</i>

51:48.993 --> 51:50.494
<i>Jeff?</i>

51:58.502 --> 51:59.369
Jeff?

52:02.774 --> 52:04.809
Jeff?

52:15.019 --> 52:17.287
Tell us where it is
and we'll be on our way.

52:19.957 --> 52:20.992
Fuck!

52:22.960 --> 52:25.830
Oh, righty-oh, mate.

52:25.997 --> 52:27.464
Oh, that...

52:27.497 --> 52:28.532
that's dirty.

52:41.545 --> 52:43.547
Fuck.

52:45.649 --> 52:46.583
Jesus.

52:49.921 --> 52:51.388
OK.

52:53.590 --> 52:55.927
We know Jeff stole it.

52:56.626 --> 52:58.495
And we know he
was hiding out in here,

52:58.528 --> 53:00.832
which means you know
why he was hiding out,

53:00.865 --> 53:03.768
which means you know
where it is. So where is it?

53:03.801 --> 53:06.469
Jeff said he needed a place
to stay for a while,

53:06.503 --> 53:07.537
but I don't know
what you mean.

53:11.042 --> 53:13.911
Please, don't hurt me, please.

53:14.611 --> 53:16.714
- Toilet?
- Yeah, yeah.

53:17.581 --> 53:18.749
- Get up.
- The toilet?

53:18.783 --> 53:20.417
- Yeah, yeah, get up. Come on.
- I don't need toilet!

53:20.450 --> 53:21.886
I don't need toilet!

53:21.919 --> 53:22.854
Right, toilet.

53:22.887 --> 53:25.022
- No, thank you. I don't need it!
- Let's go.

53:26.657 --> 53:28.659
Where is it?!

53:37.567 --> 53:40.738
Where is what!

53:40.905 --> 53:42.539
Wrong!

53:42.572 --> 53:45.710
We know that Jeff came here
after he took it!

53:45.743 --> 53:48.145
Just tell us!

53:49.780 --> 53:52.750
- Where the fuck is it?!
- Oi, oi, oi, oi.

53:52.783 --> 53:54.618
- Where the fuck is it?!
- Hey, hey. Wait, wait!

53:54.651 --> 53:57.154
Come. Hey, hey, hey.
Take it easy.

53:57.554 --> 53:58.723
What the fuck, bro?

53:58.756 --> 54:01.458
Fuck, he's no good to us dead,
is he?

54:03.160 --> 54:04.594
Come on, stay with me.

54:04.628 --> 54:05.428
Yo, bro.

54:06.998 --> 54:09.432
Hey, just tell us where it is
and we'll call an ambulance.

54:11.601 --> 54:12.737
Yo.

54:15.907 --> 54:16.841
Hey, hey, hey.

54:18.910 --> 54:20.410
Come on, no, no, no.

54:25.016 --> 54:26.449
Oh shit.

54:28.853 --> 54:30.688
You always fuck things up,
don't you?

54:31.756 --> 54:33.456
He should have told us.

54:33.858 --> 54:34.859
Fuck!

54:35.226 --> 54:36.493
Fuck!

54:36.526 --> 54:37.460
So what do we do now?

54:37.494 --> 54:39.897
Not gonna stick around here,
that's for sure.

54:39.931 --> 54:40.965
OK, let me think.

54:40.998 --> 54:43.533
We rip the place apart,
like she asked us to, OK?

54:43.566 --> 54:44.769
But we found nothing.

54:44.802 --> 54:48.239
- What about the merchandise?
- Fuck the merchandise, bro.

54:48.272 --> 54:50.107
That's two dead bodies, OK,

54:50.141 --> 54:52.243
because of this fucking
merchandise.

54:52.276 --> 54:54.812
I don't want to be body number
three, do you?

54:54.845 --> 54:55.813
Good. Let's go.

54:57.214 --> 54:59.183
Oh, wait.

55:03.054 --> 55:04.587
Fuck, Roy, come on.

55:04.621 --> 55:07.658
- Oh, what is up with his...?
- Roy!

55:29.146 --> 55:30.647
Freddy?

55:30.681 --> 55:31.949
He's gone.

55:32.649 --> 55:33.851
<i>Who?</i>

55:33.884 --> 55:35.820
The fat man, he's gone.

55:35.853 --> 55:37.021
What do you mean gone?

55:37.054 --> 55:39.690
Well, I got back here to the
place, and he's not here.

55:39.724 --> 55:41.726
- <i>He's gone.</i>
- Well, where is he?

55:41.759 --> 55:43.794
- I don't know.
- You said he was dead!

55:43.828 --> 55:46.529
- Yeah, he was, but...
- Then fucking what?!

55:46.563 --> 55:48.165
But what if he wasn't?

55:48.199 --> 55:49.599
Shit.

55:51.769 --> 55:53.104
Donny might have found him.

55:54.205 --> 55:56.907
Yeah, I-I don't think so.

55:57.607 --> 55:59.110
Well, how do you know that?

55:59.143 --> 56:00.745
Because...

56:00.778 --> 56:02.780
Donny's here.

56:03.114 --> 56:05.282
I'm looking right at him.

56:06.884 --> 56:07.852
Put him on.

56:07.885 --> 56:10.087
I can't. He's gone.

56:10.254 --> 56:12.289
Like, gone gone.

56:13.758 --> 56:15.659
- Dead gone?
- Yeah.

56:16.160 --> 56:18.195
What happened?

56:18.662 --> 56:20.197
I killed him.

56:21.365 --> 56:23.267
You killed him?

56:23.868 --> 56:25.736
Yeah, so...

56:25.970 --> 56:27.972
So you can let Marvin go now,
OK?

56:30.607 --> 56:32.777
And why would I do that, huh?

56:33.210 --> 56:35.679
Because that was the deal.

56:36.013 --> 56:39.016
I mean, I've done everything
you asked me to,

56:39.050 --> 56:41.185
and it's before the deadline,
so...

56:41.218 --> 56:43.687
So you just want me
to take your word for it

56:43.721 --> 56:48.059
that you took care of Donny
and expect me to let Marvin go?

56:48.826 --> 56:50.560
Well...

56:51.028 --> 56:52.229
yeah.

56:52.263 --> 56:55.366
Well, nah. I want proof.

56:55.399 --> 56:58.568
And until I get it,
we're not square as a bear.

56:59.236 --> 57:01.806
So here's what
I want you to do.

57:03.174 --> 57:05.109
Piece of shit!

57:05.342 --> 57:06.811
Try now!

57:08.645 --> 57:12.083
You fucking beauty!

57:13.150 --> 57:15.152
Move. Move over.

57:18.289 --> 57:19.657
OK.

57:20.191 --> 57:21.392
Let's get the fuck
out of here.

57:21.425 --> 57:23.626
Oh, oh, wait, wait, wait.

57:24.028 --> 57:25.229
Fuck, I left my prints
on the seat.

57:25.262 --> 57:26.063
Don't worry about it!

57:26.097 --> 57:28.732
No, I need to wipe
the seat clean!

57:29.400 --> 57:31.368
Fucking hurry up, then.

57:31.469 --> 57:33.170
Fuck. Shit.

57:33.204 --> 57:34.738
Fucking idiot.

57:35.239 --> 57:37.741
<i>"I want Donny's cock.</i>

57:38.342 --> 57:40.643
<i>Cut it off
and bring it to me.</i>

57:40.678 --> 57:42.246
<i>I'll know it when I see it.</i>

57:42.279 --> 57:45.182
<i>Cos how I found out
she was fucking Donny</i>

57:45.216 --> 57:47.685
<i>was finding videos
of them doing it.</i>

57:47.718 --> 57:50.721
<i>So don't bring me any old cock
that, you know,</i>

57:50.754 --> 57:54.024
<i>you cut off some fucking
homeless bloke.</i>

57:54.125 --> 57:55.793
<i>We're not square as a bear</i>

57:55.826 --> 57:59.063
<i>until Donny's cock
is in my hand.</i>

57:59.730 --> 58:01.031
<i>So you best get moving.</i>

58:01.065 --> 58:03.734
Whoo-hoo!

58:03.901 --> 58:05.836
<i>Because it's nearly noon,
Freddy.</i>

58:06.971 --> 58:08.973
<i>Tick-tock, son.</i>

58:15.012 --> 58:16.646
Sorry, bro.

58:19.917 --> 58:20.417
Ugh.

58:29.193 --> 58:30.794
Fucking shit.

58:35.799 --> 58:37.134
Fuck.

58:52.883 --> 58:54.385
- Hey.
- Hi.

58:56.020 --> 58:57.421
Fuck!

59:00.157 --> 59:02.159
Motherfucker!

59:06.997 --> 59:07.932
Semo!

59:07.965 --> 59:09.967
He was in the room!
Get him!

59:10.000 --> 59:12.002
Shit!

in that room?

59:46.804 --> 59:47.438
Nothing.

59:48.472 --> 59:50.140
Seriously?

59:50.174 --> 59:52.276
I broke in, OK?

59:52.309 --> 59:54.378
I'm sorry if that was
your guys' place.

59:55.346 --> 59:57.081
You know where it is,
don't you?

59:57.114 --> 59:58.849
Where what is?

59:58.882 --> 01:00:00.317
- What's your name?
- Freddy.

01:00:00.351 --> 01:00:01.552
Freddy who?

01:00:01.585 --> 01:00:03.053
Winiata.

01:00:03.087 --> 01:00:04.555
OK, Freddy Winiata,

01:00:04.588 --> 01:00:06.991
do you know a fat guy
called Jeff Kwok?

01:00:07.024 --> 01:00:08.792
I've never heard of him.

01:00:08.826 --> 01:00:10.828
OK. OK, OK. OK.

01:00:10.995 --> 01:00:14.531
So, you don't fuck with us
and we don't fuck with you.

01:00:14.565 --> 01:00:17.935
This is your last chance, OK?
Where is it?

01:00:18.435 --> 01:00:19.503
Where is what?

01:00:19.536 --> 01:00:20.904
Oh, OK, yeah.

01:00:20.938 --> 01:00:22.072
Yeah, yeah, yeah?

01:00:22.106 --> 01:00:23.173
OK, hey, hey.
Hey, hey, hey.

01:00:23.207 --> 01:00:23.907
You don't think I will?!

01:00:23.941 --> 01:00:25.876
Hey, hey. Hey, hey, hey.
Listen.

01:00:25.909 --> 01:00:28.879
Can we just try
and keep this one alive?

01:00:28.912 --> 01:00:30.281
Just search him.

01:00:30.314 --> 01:00:32.916
- You search him.
- Just... Just do it, Roy.

01:00:32.950 --> 01:00:34.018
Eh, that...

01:00:34.051 --> 01:00:36.053
That's not my name.

01:00:41.458 --> 01:00:44.828
Frederick Winiata.
Least you're not lying

01:00:44.862 --> 01:00:46.030
about your name, Freddy.

01:00:46.063 --> 01:00:48.599
- Is there anything else?
- He's a donor.

01:00:48.632 --> 01:00:50.834
The wallet, dick.

01:00:55.439 --> 01:00:57.374
Where'd you get this?

01:00:58.275 --> 01:01:00.010
- I stole it.
- You stole it?

01:01:00.044 --> 01:01:01.578
I can...

01:01:01.612 --> 01:01:04.448
I can sell it
for 50 bucks easy

01:01:04.481 --> 01:01:07.351
to, you know,
an illegal immigrant.

01:01:08.419 --> 01:01:09.286
Right.

01:01:09.320 --> 01:01:12.389
What, an oversized
illegal immigrant?

01:01:12.556 --> 01:01:14.558
Yeah, I mean, probably.

01:01:15.326 --> 01:01:16.560
Freddy, just tell us
where the merchandise is

01:01:16.593 --> 01:01:19.096
and we'll let you go.
It's that easy.

01:01:19.129 --> 01:01:20.831
What merchandise?

01:01:21.265 --> 01:01:23.467
Where'd you put it, bitch?

01:01:23.500 --> 01:01:24.935
Did the fat guy
give it to you

01:01:24.968 --> 01:01:27.071
or did the skinny guy
give it to you?

01:01:27.104 --> 01:01:28.906
Where'd you put it?!

01:01:28.939 --> 01:01:30.307
Yeah, OK,
he can't breathe.

01:01:30.341 --> 01:01:32.076
Hey, hey, Roy,
let him go.

01:01:32.109 --> 01:01:33.977
Hey, hey.

01:01:36.380 --> 01:01:38.082
He's not gonna tell us
because he knows

01:01:38.115 --> 01:01:40.084
how much the merchandise
is worth.

01:01:40.117 --> 01:01:41.518
He's gonna keep to his story
about breaking in

01:01:41.552 --> 01:01:44.088
because he knows
we can't prove it.

01:01:44.521 --> 01:01:45.956
Isn't that right, Freddy?

01:01:48.625 --> 01:01:49.393
Shit.

01:01:49.426 --> 01:01:51.428
- Oi.
- What?

01:01:52.697 --> 01:01:54.631
You thinking
what I'm thinking?

01:01:54.666 --> 01:01:55.834
I doubt it.

01:01:55.866 --> 01:02:00.070
We escalate the situation.
We let the skip deal with it.

01:02:00.672 --> 01:02:02.473
That's pretty good.

01:02:02.506 --> 01:02:05.042
Freddy, have you heard
of The Upholsterer?

01:02:06.678 --> 01:02:08.979
- Kind of.
- Kind of?

01:02:09.546 --> 01:02:12.082
Well, I think she'd kinda
like to see you.

01:02:16.453 --> 01:02:19.156
Do you like horses, Freddy?
Hmm?

01:02:19.990 --> 01:02:21.492
They're all right.

01:02:21.525 --> 01:02:24.061
You can tell a lot
about a horse from its teeth...

01:02:24.094 --> 01:02:27.364
its age, its diet,
its general health,

01:02:27.498 --> 01:02:30.000
even its possible vices,

01:02:30.033 --> 01:02:32.569
such as wood-chewing
and the like.

01:02:32.603 --> 01:02:35.406
Well, people are much
the same.

01:02:35.707 --> 01:02:37.474
But our vices, well,

01:02:37.508 --> 01:02:39.176
that's where you and I are quite
different from a horse

01:02:39.209 --> 01:02:43.113
because our vices aren't
quite so easy to detect.

01:02:43.147 --> 01:02:45.149
But we all have them,
don't we?

01:02:45.516 --> 01:02:47.584
So what's your vice, Freddy,
hmm?

01:02:48.720 --> 01:02:50.387
Is it drugs?

01:02:51.155 --> 01:02:52.623
Girls?

01:02:53.457 --> 01:02:55.359
Boys?

01:02:55.392 --> 01:02:57.695
And how would a young man
like yourself

01:02:57.729 --> 01:02:59.930
pay for such things, hmm?

01:03:00.330 --> 01:03:03.735
Perhaps that's why you broke
into the very same motel

01:03:03.768 --> 01:03:06.570
where a man who stole from me
something of great value

01:03:06.603 --> 01:03:08.439
was hiding out.

01:03:08.472 --> 01:03:10.340
This gentlemen right here,
in fact.

01:03:11.408 --> 01:03:13.610
What did you break into
that motel room to steal?

01:03:13.644 --> 01:03:16.647
This very same man's
driver's license.

01:03:17.181 --> 01:03:19.082
Which you say
you can get $50

01:03:19.116 --> 01:03:22.052
on some black market
for illegal immigrants.

01:03:23.320 --> 01:03:26.290
Now, I know people have
been killed for less,

01:03:26.323 --> 01:03:29.359
but $50 is not a lot of money,
is it?

01:03:30.594 --> 01:03:32.629
Perhaps you took
Jeff's license

01:03:32.664 --> 01:03:36.567
because he didn't have
a heart attack, did he?

01:03:36.668 --> 01:03:38.670
No, you killed him somehow.

01:03:39.203 --> 01:03:41.205
Perhaps asphyxiation.

01:03:41.638 --> 01:03:43.340
And then you went back
to erase any evidence

01:03:43.373 --> 01:03:44.709
that he was ever
in that room.

01:03:44.742 --> 01:03:46.410
- <i>Police.</i>
- Just a second.

01:03:46.778 --> 01:03:48.412
While you were doing that,

01:03:48.445 --> 01:03:50.581
trying to figure out where
the fat man was

01:03:50.614 --> 01:03:53.183
and how the skinny man
ended up dead,

01:03:53.217 --> 01:03:55.285
you were interrupted.
Aw!

01:03:55.319 --> 01:03:56.688
<i>Jeff?</i>

01:03:58.155 --> 01:04:00.157
But tell me, son,

01:04:00.190 --> 01:04:02.192
is it worth your life?

01:04:02.660 --> 01:04:05.529
Is getting all the money
you ever dreamed of,

01:04:05.562 --> 01:04:08.298
is it really worth dying for,
hmm?

01:04:08.700 --> 01:04:10.601
Motherfucker!

01:04:10.634 --> 01:04:12.302
Where is it?

01:04:13.738 --> 01:04:15.272
I don't know.

01:04:17.107 --> 01:04:19.243
Maybe it's in there.

01:04:19.276 --> 01:04:20.577
Hmm?

01:04:21.311 --> 01:04:23.313
Here, take a closer look.

01:04:24.716 --> 01:04:26.483
Is it in there, Freddy, hmm?

01:04:26.517 --> 01:04:29.353
I can't hear you.

01:04:29.386 --> 01:04:30.722
No?

01:04:32.122 --> 01:04:34.726
- Where is it?!
- I don't... I don't know!

01:04:36.661 --> 01:04:38.328
You could check up his date.

01:04:38.362 --> 01:04:40.364
- His what?
- His date.

01:04:40.665 --> 01:04:42.165
His arse.

01:04:42.199 --> 01:04:44.434
People put some
crazy shit up there.

01:04:44.468 --> 01:04:46.503
I saw this doco about
drug smugglers.

01:04:46.537 --> 01:04:48.171
They get condoms,
fill them full of drugs,

01:04:48.205 --> 01:04:49.640
and stick them
up their bums.

01:04:49.674 --> 01:04:51.575
It's pretty amazing what
you can fit up there.

01:04:51.608 --> 01:04:53.610
Roy, come and take a look.

01:04:54.545 --> 01:04:56.146
Wait.

01:04:56.179 --> 01:05:00.083
Wait. Slang for anus,
four letters... "date."

01:05:01.418 --> 01:05:03.153
Give me the paper
and a pen.

01:05:03.186 --> 01:05:05.188
- Hurry up.
- There you go.

01:05:07.558 --> 01:05:09.393
D-A-T-E.

01:05:09.661 --> 01:05:11.128
Perfect.

01:05:11.528 --> 01:05:13.798
Right, continue.

01:05:16.366 --> 01:05:18.368
You left his phone on him?

01:05:19.570 --> 01:05:21.638
Where's your phone, Freddy?

01:05:21.673 --> 01:05:23.675
Hmm?
Where is it?

01:05:26.376 --> 01:05:28.680
So, who'd be calling you,
hmm?

01:05:29.646 --> 01:05:31.648
I don't... I don't know.

01:05:32.750 --> 01:05:34.451
Yes?

01:05:35.519 --> 01:05:36.854
Who's this?

01:05:38.488 --> 01:05:39.556
Who's this?

01:05:40.725 --> 01:05:41.826
Who's this?

01:05:43.460 --> 01:05:44.796
Who's this?

01:05:45.395 --> 01:05:46.731
Tell me who this is!

01:05:48.900 --> 01:05:50.567
You tell me who this is.

01:05:51.401 --> 01:05:54.171
Where's Freddy?

01:05:55.606 --> 01:05:56.874
You tell me.

01:05:57.574 --> 01:05:58.175
What?

01:06:00.210 --> 01:06:02.212
Well, where should he be?

01:06:03.213 --> 01:06:05.515
Is Freddy there or not?

01:06:07.351 --> 01:06:08.720
Who wants to know?

01:06:08.753 --> 01:06:10.387
Who the fuck is this?!

01:06:10.420 --> 01:06:11.856
Who is this?!

01:06:11.889 --> 01:06:13.390
Put him on!

01:06:14.524 --> 01:06:16.593
Well, you see,
he's a bit busy.

01:06:17.594 --> 01:06:19.363
Busy doing what?

01:06:19.964 --> 01:06:21.733
Is there a message?

01:06:22.867 --> 01:06:24.401
Yeah.

01:06:25.268 --> 01:06:27.170
Yeah, here's the message.

01:06:30.374 --> 01:06:32.376
- Bang.
- Bang?

01:06:33.310 --> 01:06:34.611
Freddy.

01:06:34.645 --> 01:06:36.647
Who's expecting you?

01:06:37.314 --> 01:06:38.683
- Hmm?
- Nobody.

01:06:39.751 --> 01:06:41.218
Keep searching him.

01:06:43.220 --> 01:06:45.188
- Hey, hey.
- Hey, whoa.

01:06:45.355 --> 01:06:45.923
What is it?

01:06:45.957 --> 01:06:48.158
What's this?

01:06:49.827 --> 01:06:52.162
Had it on him
the whole time.

01:06:54.799 --> 01:06:55.933
Oh.

01:06:59.369 --> 01:07:01.304
Is that a...?

01:07:01.338 --> 01:07:02.907
Yeah, looks like it.

01:07:03.573 --> 01:07:04.608
It's kind of, um...

01:07:04.641 --> 01:07:06.343
Donny.

01:07:06.576 --> 01:07:08.245
Freddy?

01:07:08.278 --> 01:07:10.347
What are you doing with
Donny Kong's penis?

01:07:10.380 --> 01:07:11.849
It's worth heaps of money

01:07:12.817 --> 01:07:15.185
in the...
in the Asian market.

01:07:15.452 --> 01:07:19.189
It's used for soups.
It's like a delicacy.

01:07:19.556 --> 01:07:21.558
He was dead, so...

01:07:23.795 --> 01:07:25.262
Roy killed him.

01:07:25.295 --> 01:07:27.364
I... I mean,
that's where I saw it.

01:07:27.397 --> 01:07:29.466
I don't believe you've been
completely honest with us,

01:07:29.499 --> 01:07:30.835
have you?

01:07:32.602 --> 01:07:34.772
Why did you
deem it necessary

01:07:34.806 --> 01:07:37.407
to cut off
Donny Kong's penis

01:07:37.441 --> 01:07:39.744
and put it in your pocket?

01:07:39.777 --> 01:07:41.846
I have to deliver it
by noon,

01:07:41.879 --> 01:07:44.481
otherwise Marvin's
gonna get shot.

01:07:44.749 --> 01:07:46.784
Ah, bang, hmm.

01:07:47.885 --> 01:07:50.420
Come on, Freddy,
who sent you?

01:07:50.722 --> 01:07:51.689
Who was on the phone?

01:07:51.723 --> 01:07:53.590
It was... It was meant
to be the skinny man,

01:07:53.623 --> 01:07:55.927
not the fat man,
but I didn't know that.

01:07:55.960 --> 01:07:57.995
The fat man wasn't meant
to be there, was...

01:07:58.029 --> 01:08:01.398
Who fucking sent you?!

01:08:23.620 --> 01:08:25.354
Ah, what a shame.

01:08:25.790 --> 01:08:29.359
Well, can't say I didn't
give him fair warning, huh?

01:08:30.060 --> 01:08:31.929
No, no, no.
He'll make it.

01:08:31.962 --> 01:08:33.663
He will.
No, no, no, no.

01:08:33.698 --> 01:08:35.532
He'll be here.
He'll make it.

01:08:35.564 --> 01:08:37.902
- He will.
- Oh, shut the fuck up.

01:08:37.935 --> 01:08:39.603
No! No!

01:08:39.636 --> 01:08:41.505
Help! Help!

01:08:41.537 --> 01:08:44.573
Look at you. Look at you
about to pee your pants

01:08:44.608 --> 01:08:47.611
like a little fucking girl!

01:08:47.745 --> 01:08:51.348
You're fucking crazy.

01:08:51.783 --> 01:08:53.582
- Ah.
- Come again.

01:08:53.617 --> 01:08:56.453
You're fucking crazy,
you fucking psycho!

01:08:56.486 --> 01:08:58.723
I thought you were
fucking cool!

01:09:01.457 --> 01:09:02.591
Wait...

01:09:02.626 --> 01:09:04.461
I'm not cool?

01:09:04.493 --> 01:09:05.629
Well...

01:09:10.500 --> 01:09:12.670
Oh.

01:09:12.770 --> 01:09:14.738
Oh yeah!

01:09:18.508 --> 01:09:20.377
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

01:09:20.410 --> 01:09:22.345
Oh! Yeah.

01:09:22.379 --> 01:09:23.546
I might be fucking crazy,

01:09:23.580 --> 01:09:26.082
but if your friend doesn't
turn up in the next half hour,

01:09:26.117 --> 01:09:29.653
your other foot is gonna get
the same fucking treatment!

01:09:29.687 --> 01:09:31.823
<i>Don't let me interrupt,
Mickey.</i>

01:09:34.926 --> 01:09:36.359
The Upholsterer.

01:09:37.560 --> 01:09:39.362
Well, well, well.

01:09:39.997 --> 01:09:41.765
I think you know
why I'm here.

01:09:41.799 --> 01:09:43.801
Lap dance?

01:09:44.634 --> 01:09:45.903
You know, when I heard
the name Mickey Spiggs,

01:09:45.937 --> 01:09:47.705
it all made sense.

01:09:47.738 --> 01:09:49.372
I'm connected to Jeff Kwok.

01:09:49.406 --> 01:09:51.108
Jeff Kwok is connected
to Donny Kong,

01:09:51.142 --> 01:09:53.609
and Donny Kong,
if I'm not mistaken,

01:09:53.643 --> 01:09:54.979
is connected to you.

01:09:55.012 --> 01:09:56.646
I know what you did to Jeff,

01:09:56.681 --> 01:09:58.716
and the reason you did what
you did to Jeff is because

01:09:58.749 --> 01:10:01.052
you knew that he had
what belongs to me.

01:10:01.085 --> 01:10:04.621
So just hand it over
and we'll be on our way.

01:10:05.723 --> 01:10:07.124
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Take it easy, all right?

01:10:07.158 --> 01:10:08.659
Just-Just take it easy.

01:10:08.693 --> 01:10:10.761
I have no idea
who Jeff Kwok is,

01:10:10.795 --> 01:10:14.098
and I have no idea what the fuck
you're talking about.

01:10:14.131 --> 01:10:16.133
Take a seat.

01:10:16.834 --> 01:10:19.036
Jeff is a rather large man
who was killed earlier today

01:10:19.070 --> 01:10:21.038
in his place of temporary
residence by Freddy,

01:10:21.072 --> 01:10:23.440
who I believe
is in your employ.

01:10:23.473 --> 01:10:25.442
- The fat man?
- Not only was he fat, Mickey,

01:10:25.475 --> 01:10:28.880
he was also stupid.
He stole something from me.

01:10:28.913 --> 01:10:30.882
Freddy stole it from him,
killed him

01:10:30.915 --> 01:10:33.117
and then gave it to you.

01:10:33.718 --> 01:10:36.553
Yeah, nah, that's not
actually what happened.

01:10:36.586 --> 01:10:38.789
- Where the fuck is it?
- Listen,

01:10:38.823 --> 01:10:40.825
I didn't even know the fat man
existed till this morning.

01:10:40.858 --> 01:10:43.127
Oh, have I not been
polite thus far?

01:10:43.160 --> 01:10:46.030
- Yeah.
- Have I not been reasonable?

01:10:46.063 --> 01:10:48.165
- Yeah.
- Yeah. I think I have.

01:10:48.199 --> 01:10:49.499
You see,
being polite and reasonable

01:10:49.532 --> 01:10:50.968
about this is plan A.

01:10:51.002 --> 01:10:52.036
If you do not hand it over,

01:10:52.069 --> 01:10:53.771
you will force me
to go to plan B.

01:10:53.804 --> 01:10:57.174
And plan B is not so polite
and reasonable.

01:10:57.208 --> 01:10:59.643
But let me try and persuade you
to stick with plan A,

01:10:59.677 --> 01:11:02.914
because I really hate to make
a mess unnecessarily.

01:11:02.947 --> 01:11:05.615
So, first you need
to know two things.

01:11:05.649 --> 01:11:08.652
One, if the merchandise is not
back in my possession

01:11:08.686 --> 01:11:12.156
within the hour,
I will execute you.

01:11:12.823 --> 01:11:14.759
Yeah.

01:11:14.792 --> 01:11:15.660
And, two.

01:11:15.693 --> 01:11:17.762
- Pa-ching.
- One of my men is outside

01:11:17.795 --> 01:11:19.931
in a van with Freddy,
who will also be executed

01:11:19.964 --> 01:11:21.766
should plan A fail.

01:11:21.799 --> 01:11:23.968
So what's it going to be,
Mickey?

01:11:24.567 --> 01:11:27.171
Plan A, everyone lives,

01:11:27.537 --> 01:11:30.573
or plan B,
not everyone lives?

01:11:32.910 --> 01:11:34.946
It's entirely up to you.

01:11:42.253 --> 01:11:44.655
Hey, let Marvin go!

01:11:46.791 --> 01:11:47.725
Semo.

01:11:49.093 --> 01:11:50.895
How did Freddy get a gun?

01:11:51.796 --> 01:11:54.031
And why can I see
your genitals?

01:11:55.066 --> 01:11:56.466
Fucking Roy's fault.

01:12:02.740 --> 01:12:03.941
Gum?

01:12:04.842 --> 01:12:06.143
I'm cool.

01:12:07.178 --> 01:12:10.114
Hey, uh,
your dad drive a cab?

01:12:11.816 --> 01:12:13.918
Why?
Did you know him?

01:12:13.951 --> 01:12:15.152
No, not really.

01:12:26.897 --> 01:12:28.733
Bro.

01:12:31.202 --> 01:12:33.170
- How did you...?
- Hands on your head!

01:12:33.204 --> 01:12:34.571
OK.

01:12:37.008 --> 01:12:38.876
OK, just take it easy,
Freddy.

01:12:38.909 --> 01:12:40.011
Give me your gun.

01:12:42.880 --> 01:12:43.748
Give me your gun!

01:12:43.781 --> 01:12:45.116
OK.

01:12:50.821 --> 01:12:52.056
Get out.

01:12:57.161 --> 01:12:58.996
- Now take off your clothes.
- Eh?

01:12:59.030 --> 01:13:00.197
I wanna see if that's
all you're carrying.

01:13:00.231 --> 01:13:02.800
- That's everything.
- Do it!

01:13:11.742 --> 01:13:13.210
There you go, Freddy.

01:13:13.677 --> 01:13:15.012
Everything.

01:13:15.046 --> 01:13:16.313
Oh, come on!

01:13:16.735 --> 01:13:18.983
<i>Now back to the end
at the beginning.</i>

01:13:19.717 --> 01:13:21.786
<i>Or is it the other way?</i>

01:13:22.186 --> 01:13:24.188
What do you want, Freddy?

01:13:26.991 --> 01:13:28.292
Go and untie Marvin.

01:13:28.325 --> 01:13:30.728
Semo, don't you move.

01:13:31.896 --> 01:13:34.597
Do you know why they call me
The Upholsterer?

01:13:34.631 --> 01:13:37.902
I know it's not a razzle-dazzle
name like Ms. Untouchable

01:13:37.935 --> 01:13:39.870
or Bonnie Bamboo,

01:13:40.171 --> 01:13:41.705
but it fits.

01:13:41.739 --> 01:13:44.775
You see, because I like to make
people feel comfortable.

01:13:44.809 --> 01:13:46.877
Now, to make you comfortable,

01:13:46.911 --> 01:13:51.348
I assume I'd have to let you
and Marvin leave here intact.

01:13:51.382 --> 01:13:53.717
Yes?
For me to feel comfortable,

01:13:53.751 --> 01:13:56.253
I need to leave here
with my merchandise.

01:13:56.821 --> 01:14:00.191
So why don't we just make
each other comfortable, hm?

01:14:03.127 --> 01:14:04.662
OK, yeah.

01:14:05.196 --> 01:14:06.764
I have it.

01:14:08.365 --> 01:14:09.767
Marvin leaves
and you get it back.

01:14:09.800 --> 01:14:12.369
No, the merchandise first.

01:14:16.373 --> 01:14:18.175
OK, but...

01:14:19.376 --> 01:14:21.378
we do this without guns.

01:14:21.412 --> 01:14:22.880
We all put them down.

01:14:22.913 --> 01:14:24.949
You're dreaming, mate.

01:14:28.986 --> 01:14:30.321
Well?

01:14:31.088 --> 01:14:32.790
Where is it?

01:14:32.990 --> 01:14:34.191
Safe.

01:15:00.117 --> 01:15:01.418
Roy.

01:15:01.986 --> 01:15:03.988
But then he can just
shoot us.

01:15:04.021 --> 01:15:07.158
Oh, I think Freddy knows
that would be a mistake.

01:15:07.191 --> 01:15:08.859
Put... your...

01:15:08.893 --> 01:15:10.928
gun... down.

01:15:12.997 --> 01:15:14.798
Put your fucking gun down.

01:15:19.170 --> 01:15:21.338
Your other gun, Freddy.

01:15:26.043 --> 01:15:27.444
Frederick Winiata.

01:15:29.947 --> 01:15:31.115
How did you know him?

01:15:34.952 --> 01:15:37.021
How did you know my dad?!

01:15:39.356 --> 01:15:41.392
He was a good man,
reliable...

01:15:41.425 --> 01:15:42.927
mostly.

01:15:42.960 --> 01:15:45.462
Liked the ponies.

01:15:46.864 --> 01:15:48.165
He worked for you?

01:15:48.532 --> 01:15:50.734
Of course he did.

01:15:51.035 --> 01:15:53.938
A pick-up or a drop-off
every now and then.

01:15:55.005 --> 01:15:57.374
Well, he had the perfect cover,
didn't he?

01:15:59.910 --> 01:16:01.712
Why'd he die?

01:16:02.479 --> 01:16:04.348
Does it matter?

01:16:07.151 --> 01:16:09.153
You do look a bit like him.

01:16:12.022 --> 01:16:14.058
You can put it down.
I didn't kill him.

01:16:14.792 --> 01:16:16.427
I don't believe you.

01:16:16.460 --> 01:16:18.095
Don't believe what...

01:16:18.128 --> 01:16:21.732
that he worked for me
or that I didn't kill him?

01:16:27.471 --> 01:16:30.140
Well, what if I did, hmm?

01:16:30.574 --> 01:16:33.344
What if he owed me
a shit ton of cash?

01:16:34.111 --> 01:16:35.512
What are you gonna
do about it?

01:16:36.380 --> 01:16:38.182
You gonna fuck me up?

01:16:38.215 --> 01:16:40.050
Avenge his death?

01:16:40.918 --> 01:16:42.253
Go on, then.

01:16:42.286 --> 01:16:44.388
Be as stupid as he was.

01:16:48.025 --> 01:16:49.126
Fuck this!

01:16:50.594 --> 01:16:52.429
<i>Holy shit,
I'm gonna die!</i>

01:16:52.463 --> 01:16:54.331
<i>That's what I should be
thinking right about now,</i>

01:16:54.365 --> 01:16:57.901
<i>but that's not what went
through my head in this moment.</i>

01:16:57.935 --> 01:16:59.837
<i>What went through my head was,</i>

01:16:59.870 --> 01:17:02.439
<i>"If only the fat man
was skinny."</i>

01:17:56.260 --> 01:17:58.395
<i>Well, this is it.</i>

01:17:58.996 --> 01:18:01.198
<i>This is how my shit day ends.</i>

01:18:04.902 --> 01:18:06.503
<i>What would you do...</i>

01:18:06.537 --> 01:18:08.339
<i>pull the trigger for Dad?</i>

01:18:12.343 --> 01:18:15.045
<i>Or would that make me
just like her?</i>

01:18:20.451 --> 01:18:22.353
<i>She does deserve it.</i>

01:18:29.393 --> 01:18:31.428
<i>Nah.</i>

01:18:40.404 --> 01:18:41.572
<i>Shit, Marv!</i>

01:18:43.440 --> 01:18:45.576
Hey, hey, Marv.

01:18:45.609 --> 01:18:48.879
- Is it over?
- Yeah, we gotta go.

01:18:59.022 --> 01:19:01.125
- Guess it's possible, bro.
- What?

01:19:01.158 --> 01:19:03.193
I think I got a limp
in both legs.

01:19:08.365 --> 01:19:10.067
It's not what it looks like.

01:19:13.437 --> 01:19:14.972
Wait, wait.

01:19:15.105 --> 01:19:18.275
Wait, seriously,
we had nothing to do with this.

01:19:18.308 --> 01:19:20.978
All we did was try
and pay back Spiggs.

01:19:21.011 --> 01:19:22.212
This was all The Upholsterer.

01:19:22.246 --> 01:19:25.416
She was saying Spiggs stole
something from her, and it...

01:19:25.449 --> 01:19:27.184
got, like, kinda crazy,

01:19:27.217 --> 01:19:29.987
and Marvin's been
shot in the leg, and...

01:19:30.587 --> 01:19:33.390
I've got to get him
to a doctor pronto.

01:19:34.091 --> 01:19:36.093
Hey,

01:19:36.527 --> 01:19:38.629
Spiggs is dead, dudes.

01:19:40.197 --> 01:19:42.533
That makes you in charge,
right?

01:20:00.484 --> 01:20:01.952
We doing this or what?

01:20:02.486 --> 01:20:03.420
Yeah, bro.

01:20:04.455 --> 01:20:06.957
We don't take risks,

01:20:07.491 --> 01:20:09.059
we get nowhere.

01:20:09.092 --> 01:20:10.662
It's all good, bro.

01:20:14.732 --> 01:20:16.500
I got this.

01:20:33.083 --> 01:20:34.384
<i>Marvin and me
never did find out</i>

01:20:34.418 --> 01:20:36.721
<i>what the merchandise was,</i>

01:20:37.387 --> 01:20:39.289
<i>but I still think about
what it might be</i>

01:20:39.323 --> 01:20:40.758
<i>and where it might be.</i>

01:20:41.458 --> 01:20:43.761
<i>Like, is it back at that motel?</i>

01:20:44.294 --> 01:20:45.996
<i>Could be.</i>

01:20:46.096 --> 01:20:48.432
<i>And I think about breaking in
and finding it,</i>

01:20:49.266 --> 01:20:50.534
<i>but then I'm like,</i>

01:20:50.567 --> 01:20:53.637
<i>"Nah, I never want to
go back into that room.</i>

01:20:54.238 --> 01:20:56.674
<i>All those fullas
got killed over it."</i>

01:20:57.742 --> 01:21:00.077
<i>So we're gonna stay on
the straight and narrow.</i>

01:21:00.678 --> 01:21:03.013
<i>Yep, we got big plans.</i>

01:21:03.413 --> 01:21:06.183
<i>I'm gonna turn this shit
around, Dad.</i>

01:21:06.216 --> 01:21:07.752
<i>Make you proud</i>

01:21:07.785 --> 01:21:10.087
<i>and show you I can do it.</i>

01:21:11.388 --> 01:21:13.624
<i>They say there's dough
in pizzas if you get it right,</i>

01:21:13.658 --> 01:21:15.526
<i>so me and Marv
are gonna learn the ropes,</i>

01:21:15.559 --> 01:21:17.594
<i>save hard and start
our own franchise.</i>

01:21:19.463 --> 01:21:22.165
<i>We're gonna be high on the hog.
You wait and see.</i>

01:21:22.800 --> 01:21:27.271
<i>Yeah, it'll take a while,
but we're gonna get there.</i>

01:21:27.504 --> 01:21:29.774
<i>We're gonna tear it up, baby!</i>

01:21:29.807 --> 01:21:31.241
<i>Hells yeah!</i>

01:21:51.602 --> 01:21:56.602
