WEBVTT

00:05.130 --> 00:06.880
So, Reed, are you nervous?

00:08.258 --> 00:11.135
Um, I'm a little bit nervous.

00:11.261 --> 00:12.845
It's funny.
I can sing in front of people

00:12.971 --> 00:14.847
and just not even care
at all,

00:14.973 --> 00:17.391
but my stomach is in knots.

00:17.517 --> 00:20.561
I'm nervous.
I just want it to go off
without problems.

00:20.687 --> 00:23.230
We put too much planning
into this.
Yeah.

00:23.356 --> 00:25.357
The kids and I are here
with Reed in New York City

00:25.483 --> 00:29.028
because he is about to propose
to his girlfriend, Brighton.

00:29.154 --> 00:30.404
I liked Brighton
since eighth grade,

00:30.530 --> 00:31.822
and I liked her ever since.

00:31.948 --> 00:33.115
We were, like, "best friends."

00:33.241 --> 00:34.950
I was friends
and it was so hard,

00:35.076 --> 00:37.494
and I was, like, the best friend
that had a crush on,

00:37.620 --> 00:39.371
you know, like in the movies.
That's true.

00:39.497 --> 00:40.789
I can't wait
for this to be over.

00:40.915 --> 00:42.499
Unless she says no.

00:42.625 --> 00:44.251
Then the plane ride home

00:44.377 --> 00:46.545
might not be too much fun.

00:46.671 --> 00:49.256
She has no idea, none.

00:49.382 --> 00:52.301
He's just praying
that he says yes.
Right?

00:52.427 --> 00:54.011
I just want it to be good
for her, you know,

00:54.137 --> 00:56.305
because I could just do it
at the house, you know.

00:56.431 --> 00:57.890
"Hey, let's get married."
You know? Like...

00:58.016 --> 00:59.641
Yeah, no.

00:59.768 --> 01:01.351
I mean, look.
In the backyard would be
more romantic

01:01.478 --> 01:03.687
than how Jase proposed to me.

01:03.813 --> 01:05.814
Yeah. But--
No, no. No, it's gotta be
better than that.

01:05.940 --> 01:08.734
So it's Christmas Eve.

01:08.860 --> 01:10.903
Jase brings me to the front room
of his grandparents' house

01:11.029 --> 01:13.197
to give me my present,

01:13.323 --> 01:14.990
and it's a potted plant.

01:15.116 --> 01:17.659
And he says,
"Dig around in the dirt.

01:17.786 --> 01:19.661
Your present's in the pot."

01:19.788 --> 01:21.955
Brighton will have this memory,
and Reed,

01:22.082 --> 01:23.457
for the rest of their lives.
Yeah.

01:23.583 --> 01:26.126
Just like I have the memory

01:26.252 --> 01:28.420
of my proposal

01:28.546 --> 01:30.756
from Jase.

01:30.882 --> 01:33.217
Okay, I'm a little annoyed,

01:33.343 --> 01:35.761
but I start digging around,
and I feel something.

01:35.887 --> 01:37.554
So I pull it out,
and it's a box.

01:37.680 --> 01:39.807
So I open it up, and of course
it's an engagement ring.

01:39.933 --> 01:42.309
And I'm stunned,

01:42.435 --> 01:44.645
and he says,

01:44.771 --> 01:46.897
"Well, you're gonna marry me,
aren't ya?"

01:48.775 --> 01:51.276
And that's our proposal story.

01:51.402 --> 01:53.237
It's funny how everything

01:53.363 --> 01:55.864
is just kind of, like,
working to perfection almost.

01:55.990 --> 01:57.991
It's almost
too good to be true.
I don't wanna jinx it first.

01:58.118 --> 02:00.828
Well, I think I can see
how God is working.

02:00.954 --> 02:02.454
Jase and I got married
so young.

02:02.580 --> 02:04.998
I was still in high school.

02:05.125 --> 02:08.919
Even though it was hard,
I know that God put him
in my life at that time,

02:09.045 --> 02:11.713
and so I feel the same way
about Reed and Brighton.

02:11.840 --> 02:14.216
Thank you for always
supporting me in everything.

02:14.342 --> 02:15.551
I love you.

02:15.677 --> 02:17.052
Love you too, Mom.

02:21.558 --> 02:23.058
Can't cry, because then Brighton
will be like, "What the heck?"

02:24.602 --> 02:26.854
Too late.

02:26.980 --> 02:30.274
I'm redoing my makeup.

02:39.409 --> 02:42.077
Hmm.

02:44.164 --> 02:45.998
Well, today is the day.

02:46.124 --> 02:50.460
At any moment, Reed's
proposing to Brighton.

02:50.587 --> 02:54.464
But I have the perfect idea
for what he should do.

02:54.591 --> 02:56.842
It ain't what you done,
is it?
No.

02:56.968 --> 02:59.970
But it's kind of
taking what I did
and making it better.

03:00.096 --> 03:02.681
Oh, good grief.
'Cause I realize where
I could've made it better.

03:02.807 --> 03:06.810
While my proposal had
many great qualities--

03:06.936 --> 03:09.313
I took the ring.
I buried it in a little
potted plant.

03:09.439 --> 03:11.315
That's the stupidest thing
I've ever heard of.

03:11.441 --> 03:14.526
...it was not the most
romantic proposal possible.

03:14.652 --> 03:16.111
Mine was not good either.

03:16.237 --> 03:18.322
My engagement story
was awesome.

03:18.448 --> 03:20.282
We were at Mom and Dad's,
and we're sitting there,
laying on the bed,

03:20.408 --> 03:22.451
and I was just, like,

03:22.577 --> 03:24.578
"Why don't we just get
married, like, tomorrow?"

03:26.414 --> 03:29.333
So she was-- "All right."
That's it?

03:29.459 --> 03:30.792
Hey. There you go.

03:30.919 --> 03:32.711
There's a man
who knows what to do.

03:32.837 --> 03:34.338
"You want to marry me?"
You like that?

03:34.464 --> 03:36.548
Short, sweet,
and to the point.

03:36.674 --> 03:40.719
But after hearing these guys
and their less-than-stellar
proposals--

03:40.845 --> 03:42.638
I took Paula
squirrel hunting.

03:42.764 --> 03:46.642
...I have the greatest proposal
in this duck call room.

03:46.768 --> 03:48.560
Me and the woman went
to the restaurant, and I said,

03:48.686 --> 03:50.771
"Hey, we gonna
get hitched or not?"

03:50.897 --> 03:53.649
You know?
And she said, "No."

03:53.775 --> 03:57.319
Eight hours later,
she finally said yes.
Eight hours later?

03:57.445 --> 04:00.113
Yeah.
Was this a proposal,
or was this an interrogation?

04:00.240 --> 04:01.949
It's a shock

04:02.075 --> 04:05.535
that any of these guys
are married.

04:05.662 --> 04:07.955
There he is. Reed?
<i> Hi, Dad.</i>

04:08.081 --> 04:10.249
Have you asked her yet?
<i> No, I haven't.</i>

04:10.375 --> 04:14.127
We're-- We're going to
in probably about 45 minutes.

04:14.254 --> 04:17.256
Look, I got an idea.
Oh, no.

04:17.382 --> 04:19.174
<i> I know this will work.</i>

04:19.300 --> 04:21.843
I'd love to hear this.
Go buy a metal detector.

04:21.970 --> 04:23.011
No.
Nope.

04:23.137 --> 04:24.429
No.
No!

04:24.555 --> 04:26.348
Go to Central Park
and dig a hole.

04:26.474 --> 04:27.766
Might find a body.

04:27.892 --> 04:29.059
That'd ruin everything.
It would.

04:29.185 --> 04:30.686
<i>Put the ring in it.</i>

04:30.812 --> 04:32.604
What's your deal
with burying stuff?

04:32.730 --> 04:34.856
No, I'd rather not start
a tradition

04:34.983 --> 04:36.900
of digging in the dirt.

04:37.026 --> 04:40.279
Jase has tried to convince me
for the last 25 years

04:40.405 --> 04:42.864
that his proposal
was a work of art.

04:42.991 --> 04:45.158
So it's still
like a flowerpot proposal.

04:45.285 --> 04:46.994
Just the flowerpot got bigger.

04:47.120 --> 04:48.912
<i> This isn't flower pots.</i>

04:49.038 --> 04:51.290
<i>This is Central Park!</i>

04:51.416 --> 04:54.334
Jase is either
the Vincent Van Gogh
of marriage proposals--

04:54.460 --> 04:58.088
<i> Dig a hole.</i>
...or he's just
a stubborn redneck

04:58.214 --> 05:01.341
who made his then girlfriend
dig in a pot of dirt.

05:01.467 --> 05:02.884
But at least there was
a ring in it

05:03.011 --> 05:04.219
and not an ear.

05:04.345 --> 05:05.512
Move on. Move on.

05:05.638 --> 05:07.097
<i>All right, well,</i>

05:07.223 --> 05:08.307
I love you.

05:08.433 --> 05:10.851
Be strong and courageous.

05:10.977 --> 05:12.102
Love you, too, Dad.
All right, bye, babe.

05:12.228 --> 05:13.020
<i> I hope it works out.</i>

05:13.146 --> 05:14.563
Yes, sir.

05:14.689 --> 05:15.689
<i> All right, bye.</i>

05:15.815 --> 05:16.940
Bye.

05:17.066 --> 05:19.318
Well, I tried.

05:19.444 --> 05:20.736
Digging in the dirt?
Really?

05:20.862 --> 05:22.779
Who doesn't like to dig
in the dirt?

05:22.905 --> 05:24.281
Um, adults.

05:24.407 --> 05:26.408
Was there ever pirates
in New York?

05:26.534 --> 05:28.327
Y'all are missing
my point here.

05:28.453 --> 05:30.412
You might find treasure
before you find a ring,
and get rich.

05:30.538 --> 05:32.372
I didn't even get
to the end of it.

05:32.498 --> 05:34.416
You lost me at digging
in the dirt.
That's right.

05:34.542 --> 05:37.919
Women want an innovator.
They want a pi--

05:38.046 --> 05:39.546
Pirate?
No.

05:39.672 --> 05:42.841
- They want a pioneer.
- Hey, speaking about that,

05:42.967 --> 05:46.386
you guys got an innovator
right here with y'all.

05:48.097 --> 05:50.432
What in the world?
What is that?

05:50.558 --> 05:54.019
I ain't quite got the band
worked out on it yet, boys.

05:54.145 --> 05:55.062
Yeah.

05:56.773 --> 05:58.190
Camouflage your beard.

06:00.234 --> 06:02.235
You snapped.
I what?

06:02.362 --> 06:05.614
Done. You're done here.
No. No, I ain't done with.

06:05.740 --> 06:07.657
I got a meeting at 3:00
with Willie.

06:07.784 --> 06:09.576
Willie's not going
to like that.
Sure he'll like it.

06:09.702 --> 06:11.620
No, he's not.
Did you buy that T-shirt?

06:11.746 --> 06:15.248
Look, to make an omelet,
you've got to crack an egg.

06:15.375 --> 06:17.334
I told you,
I'm an innovator.

06:17.460 --> 06:19.669
Yeah. You're something.

06:29.722 --> 06:32.891
Dad, do you know anything
about bell curves?

06:33.017 --> 06:35.685
Well, there's a certain curve
in business

06:35.812 --> 06:38.605
that... will...

06:38.731 --> 06:41.191
curve...
Somehow it curves.

06:41.317 --> 06:43.944
So, since you're so good
at business,

06:44.070 --> 06:47.697
my teacher said that if we get
a local businessperson

06:47.824 --> 06:50.450
to come speak in class,
then we get extra credit.

06:50.576 --> 06:52.452
And that would be awesome,
because I really need it.

06:52.578 --> 06:54.079
When do they want me to come?

06:54.205 --> 06:55.872
Tonight.
Sadie,

06:55.998 --> 06:57.916
why don't you give me
a little heads-up here?

06:58.042 --> 07:01.044
Yeah, but--
Y'all need to take a class
on scheduling.

07:01.170 --> 07:03.588
Business 101--
set up a schedule.

07:03.714 --> 07:05.674
Willie, we still good
for our 3:30?

07:05.800 --> 07:09.386
Can we do it tomorrow?
You had a meeting
with me scheduled.

07:09.512 --> 07:11.346
You just said scheduling is,
like, key to business.

07:11.472 --> 07:13.723
Yeah.
Come on, bring it in.
Si...

07:13.850 --> 07:15.475
Why is Godwin in my office?

07:15.601 --> 07:18.728
Why is he setting up
an easel?

07:18.855 --> 07:19.938
That's part
of the presentation.

07:20.064 --> 07:21.731
I don't have time to hear--

07:21.858 --> 07:22.732
Have you ever wondered why,

07:22.859 --> 07:23.733
when we're duck hunting,

07:23.860 --> 07:25.527
I'm not killing much?

07:25.653 --> 07:28.029
I think it's kind of obvious.
You can't shoot.

07:28.156 --> 07:30.031
No, it ain't that. Look, hey.
You can't see.
You can't hear.

07:30.158 --> 07:31.158
Just to help the sales pitch,
okay,

07:31.284 --> 07:34.369
it works better
when you say yes.

07:34.495 --> 07:37.622
Well, that's not
a sales pitch.
Look, the answer is yes.

07:37.748 --> 07:40.917
If you're giving
a sales pitch, you can't
tell me what to say.

07:41.043 --> 07:44.504
Have you ever wondered
why I'm not killing any ducks
when we're duck hunting?

07:44.630 --> 07:47.591
Si, I never think about that.
I knew you was wondering.

07:47.717 --> 07:50.260
Si--
The reason is they're seeing
this white beard.

07:50.386 --> 07:51.344
I'm sure it is.

07:51.471 --> 07:53.054
Look. Turn my sign around.

07:53.181 --> 07:55.765
¶ Dun, dun, dun dun! ¶

07:55.892 --> 07:57.017
Beard-a-flage!

07:57.143 --> 07:58.143
Beard-a-flage!

08:02.523 --> 08:06.651
Hey, like many geniuses,
okay, my brilliance
is underappreciated.

08:06.777 --> 08:10.113
Willie's never jumped on board
about any of my ideals
in the past.

08:10.239 --> 08:13.325
Help me help you
make some big money.

08:13.451 --> 08:15.243
Si--
Every time I touch this,
all I hear is

08:15.369 --> 08:17.579
cha-ching, cha-ching,
cha-ching.

08:17.705 --> 08:21.291
Look, I've pitched
plenty of brilliant ideals,
okay?

08:21.417 --> 08:24.211
For example,
Pitch Purr-fect.

08:24.337 --> 08:26.671
He taped a microphone
to his cat.

08:26.797 --> 08:29.966
And who can forget
Parmesan Wayne?
Parme-John Wayne?

08:30.092 --> 08:31.760
It was a cheese grater
shaped like a cowboy.

08:31.886 --> 08:33.553
All right, actually that's
kind of a good idea.

08:33.679 --> 08:35.347
The Hey-K-47.

08:35.473 --> 08:37.641
The Hey-K-47
was supposed to fire

08:37.767 --> 08:39.226
anytime you said "Hey."

08:39.352 --> 08:41.019
Hey!

08:41.145 --> 08:42.395
I mean,
if Fat Albert came on TV,

08:42.522 --> 08:44.147
everyone would have to duck
for cover.

08:44.273 --> 08:46.316
Hey, it's--
Do you want my opinion?

08:46.442 --> 08:48.401
Hit me with it.

08:48.528 --> 08:51.571
It's the dumbest thing
I've ever seen in my life.

08:51.697 --> 08:54.032
You're not thinking
this through. I didn't even
tell you the best part.

08:54.158 --> 08:55.951
You know what
this is made out of?

08:56.077 --> 08:58.119
You better not have cut up
one of our shirts to do that.

08:58.246 --> 09:00.038
One of them?
No, this was the prototype.

09:00.164 --> 09:02.499
It took me ten.
Are you kidding?

09:02.625 --> 09:04.918
Look. You got a warehouse
full of free T-shirts, okay?

09:05.044 --> 09:07.128
They're not free T-shirts!
I buy them!

09:07.255 --> 09:09.256
Look. We're gonna make
a bunch of money on this.

09:09.382 --> 09:11.049
It takes money to make money.
Yeah.

09:11.175 --> 09:13.593
Godwin--
It takes money to make money.

09:13.719 --> 09:15.053
You should say that tonight.
Do not forget that.

09:15.179 --> 09:16.638
What y'all got
going on tonight?

09:16.764 --> 09:18.557
Nothing.
It's a thing for my class.
Like--

09:18.683 --> 09:20.559
Sadie--
We're supposed to get
a businessman to come in,

09:20.685 --> 09:22.519
so Dad's doing our business--
Oh, he's doing the lecture?

09:22.645 --> 09:23.770
Yeah.
Sadie!

09:23.896 --> 09:25.772
I'll be there.
Never tell him

09:25.898 --> 09:27.732
any future plans that you have.

09:27.858 --> 09:29.985
Look. I'm trying to start
a business here,

09:30.111 --> 09:33.029
so I might learn something here
from what you got to say.

09:33.155 --> 09:35.198
Never tell him
where you're going.
Yeah, I'll be there.

09:35.324 --> 09:37.158
All right. Thank you.
I'm not interested.

09:37.285 --> 09:39.661
Come on, Godwin.
We gotta go work on
some more shirts.

09:39.787 --> 09:41.871
Do not cut any more
of my T-shirts!

09:41.998 --> 09:44.124
Hey, I'll see you tonight
at the business class.

09:45.418 --> 09:47.502
I might actually
learn something.

09:53.217 --> 09:54.551
Okay, Reed, we're going to go
change real quick.

09:54.677 --> 09:55.844
We'll meet you downstairs.
Okay?

09:55.970 --> 09:57.178
All right. Hurry.
All right, I love you.

09:57.305 --> 10:00.098
Love you too.

10:00.224 --> 10:02.892
Dear Lord, thank You
for this day
that You've given us,

10:03.019 --> 10:06.438
and, Lord, I just pray for
mine and Brighton's marriage,

10:06.564 --> 10:09.232
Lord,
and I pray that we always--
we always make it through,

10:09.358 --> 10:11.234
and we always rely on You
for everything we need, Lord.

10:11.360 --> 10:13.820
And thank You for everything
that You've given us,

10:13.946 --> 10:17.198
and in Jesus' name we pray.
Amen.

10:19.160 --> 10:20.910
I'm ready.

10:21.037 --> 10:23.663
The plan is,
we're going to pretend

10:23.789 --> 10:26.166
to take family photos
in the park.

10:26.292 --> 10:28.043
We're now walking
to Central Park

10:28.169 --> 10:29.836
for the proposal.

10:29.962 --> 10:31.963
Stay tuned for more news.
Stay tuned.

10:32.089 --> 10:34.716
For more happy,
exciting news.

10:34.842 --> 10:37.177
My heart is pounding
out of my chest.

10:37.303 --> 10:39.679
I've got a photographer set up
so she doesn't expect anything.

10:39.805 --> 10:41.431
We just want to get
a few pictures, so...

10:42.683 --> 10:43.558
Yeah.

10:43.684 --> 10:45.268
A group one?
Yeah.

10:45.394 --> 10:46.895
I'm going to ask Brighton
to turn around

10:47.021 --> 10:48.855
and point at a building
to take a picture,

10:48.981 --> 10:50.398
and when she turns
back around,

10:50.524 --> 10:51.775
I'll be on one knee.

10:51.901 --> 10:53.318
I am so nervous.

10:57.365 --> 10:58.573
Yeah, Reed, you should get
one with Brighton.

10:58.699 --> 10:59.783
Yeah.

11:01.619 --> 11:03.745
Oh, that's pretty.

11:03.871 --> 11:07.040
The lighting is awesome.
Okay. Thanks.

11:07.166 --> 11:09.417
Okay.
Wait, Brighton. I want
to take a picture of you.

11:09.543 --> 11:11.086
Turn around and look.

11:11.212 --> 11:13.797
Turn around and look, like,
point that way.

11:15.132 --> 11:16.299
Okay, that's good.

11:16.425 --> 11:17.759
You can turn back around.

11:19.220 --> 11:20.261
Reed!

11:20.388 --> 11:21.846
Brighton, will you marry me?

11:24.892 --> 11:26.309
Yes.

11:26.435 --> 11:27.769
Yay. I love y'all.

11:27.895 --> 11:30.313
Yeah.

11:33.317 --> 11:34.984
Oh, Reed, I'm going to cry.

11:40.991 --> 11:42.492
Okay, now I think we're all crying.
I know.

11:52.128 --> 11:55.255
Jase, you heard anything yet?
Nope.

11:55.381 --> 11:58.842
Hm.
It takes a while to find
buried treasure.

11:58.968 --> 12:01.177
There he is.

12:01.303 --> 12:02.512
All right, here we go.

12:02.638 --> 12:03.596
Reed.

12:03.723 --> 12:05.181
Hey, Dad.

12:05.307 --> 12:07.267
All right, go ahead
and break it to me.
Baa.

12:07.393 --> 12:10.520
All right, she said yes.
Yes!

12:10.646 --> 12:13.982
Yes.
Brighton, he could not
have done better.

12:14.108 --> 12:15.024
Hm.

12:15.151 --> 12:16.234
Thank you.

12:16.360 --> 12:17.986
<i> Yeah, no doubt about it.</i>

12:18.112 --> 12:19.612
<i> All right, well,</i>
<i> I'm happy for y'all.</i>

12:19.739 --> 12:21.698
Yes, sir, thank you.
Thank you.

12:21.824 --> 12:23.241
<i> All right, love y'all.</i>

12:23.367 --> 12:24.701
Love you too.
Love you.

12:24.827 --> 12:26.536
<i> - All right. Bye.</i>
-   Bye.

12:26.662 --> 12:29.664
I noticed you said that Reed
couldn't have done any better.

12:29.790 --> 12:32.500
Do you think
Brighton could have?

12:34.587 --> 12:36.713
There you go.
There you go.

12:36.839 --> 12:40.508
A small part of me
is actually regretting the fact

12:40.634 --> 12:44.304
that I'm missing
what's happening
in New York City.

12:44.430 --> 12:47.515
And even though Reed
didn't go with my idea
about the metal detector,

12:47.641 --> 12:50.852
his proposal
was pretty awesome.

12:50.978 --> 12:53.229
You thought you'd
got rid of a son. Nope.

12:53.355 --> 12:55.231
All you've done
is gained a daughter-in-law.

12:55.357 --> 12:56.775
I gained a daughter-in-law.
They're moving in your house.

12:56.901 --> 12:59.402
Once they sign the dotted line,

12:59.528 --> 13:02.238
my financial obligation is--

13:02.364 --> 13:03.823
Just getting started.

13:03.949 --> 13:06.785
That's right.

13:06.911 --> 13:11.539
I guess it is possible
that proposing on a bridge
in Central Park

13:11.665 --> 13:16.586
is better than digging in a pot
to find your ring.

13:16.712 --> 13:19.172
Okay. When I proposed
to Missy,

13:19.298 --> 13:21.174
it could've been
a little better.

13:21.300 --> 13:23.051
You know what I'm gonna do?

13:23.177 --> 13:25.678
I'm gonna throw a party
when they get back.

13:25.805 --> 13:27.931
It'll be a surprise party.
See, now you're thinking.

13:28.057 --> 13:32.685
The last party I planned
was probably back
in the early '80s.

13:32.812 --> 13:34.145
Yeah.

13:34.271 --> 13:35.814
I don't wanna make you feel old,

13:35.940 --> 13:38.024
but I wasn't even born
in the early '80s.

13:41.821 --> 13:43.655
All right.

13:43.781 --> 13:45.990
The '80s was just a blur for me.

13:50.246 --> 13:51.788
Beard-a-flage!

13:51.914 --> 13:54.499
Hey, guys, I'm Willie Robertson,

13:54.625 --> 13:56.459
and it's an honor to be invited
to come back

13:56.585 --> 14:00.380
and share a little wisdom
with you about business.

14:00.506 --> 14:03.633
One of the most important
things about business
is actually selling a product.

14:03.759 --> 14:08.429
So, uh, do I have any volunteers
to sell me something?

14:10.891 --> 14:12.433
Sadie, thank you.
Come on down.

14:12.560 --> 14:14.394
Okay.

14:14.520 --> 14:16.521
Sadie, I have here an eraser.

14:16.647 --> 14:19.190
Okay. Okay.
Why do I need that eraser?

14:19.316 --> 14:23.403
It's durable, it's affordable,
and it's the best eraser
you will ever come across.

14:23.529 --> 14:25.363
I just don't think
I need that eraser.
Okay.

14:25.489 --> 14:28.825
Nah, nah, nah, nah.
Do not take no
for an answer.

14:28.951 --> 14:30.952
You're gonna refuse
to hear "no."
Okay.

14:31.078 --> 14:32.954
Um, actually, new data suggests

14:33.080 --> 14:35.915
that the time spent trying
to change a "no" to a "yes"

14:36.041 --> 14:39.627
can actually, um, equate
to a sizable opportunity cost.

14:44.466 --> 14:47.427
Look, it turns out old Willie's
wasting everybody's time,
all right?

14:47.553 --> 14:50.346
But, hey, yours truly--
I'm fixin' to fix that.

14:50.472 --> 14:52.932
Somebody's been
Googling stuff.

14:53.058 --> 14:55.393
I don't think
that I agree with that.
Si, what are you doing up here?

14:55.519 --> 14:57.979
Do you wanna buy this eraser?
I don't know.
Let me see.

14:58.105 --> 14:59.981
Yeah, I do.
I need this eraser.
Si...

15:00.107 --> 15:01.733
Hey, I'm fixin'
to give these students

15:01.859 --> 15:04.444
a real-life lesson in sales.

15:04.570 --> 15:07.822
And I'm not gonna
take no for an answer.
Unless the question is:

15:07.948 --> 15:10.950
has there ever been
a better product
than Beard-a-flage?

15:11.076 --> 15:14.704
And the answer to that is no!

15:14.830 --> 15:17.540
Si, I'm the teacher,
and I'm telling you--
Hey--

15:17.666 --> 15:20.877
Actually, I'm the teacher.
And let's hear him out.

15:21.003 --> 15:23.087
What we need
is Beard-a-flage.

15:23.213 --> 15:25.423
I'm going to sit down.

15:25.549 --> 15:27.342
Si, nobody wants to hear
this stupid idea.
Yeah, they do.

15:27.468 --> 15:29.719
Hello, students.
My name is Si Robertson.

15:29.845 --> 15:31.971
I'm an inventor.
He's got
the entrepreneurial spirit.

15:32.097 --> 15:34.182
And look,
I'm looking for investors

15:34.308 --> 15:37.226
to invest in my,
uh, Beard-a-flage.

15:37.353 --> 15:41.606
And if anybody wants
to buy this one--
Look, 39.95.

15:41.732 --> 15:44.525
Si.
'Cause, look, I got a warehouse
full of T-shirts.

15:44.652 --> 15:46.778
I can make another prototype.
Si.

15:46.904 --> 15:49.238
What?
You do not have a warehouse
full of T-shirts.

15:49.365 --> 15:53.785
Sure, I do.
Here. Here's 20 bucks.
I just bought this.

15:53.911 --> 15:55.578
We're done.
You can sit down.
All right. All right.

15:55.704 --> 15:57.872
Thank you.

15:57.998 --> 16:00.375
All right.
Are there any more questions?

16:00.501 --> 16:01.751
Si.

16:01.877 --> 16:04.754
How do you manufacture

16:04.880 --> 16:06.965
1,000 of just what I
just sold you?

16:07.091 --> 16:11.177
Whoa! That's cold!

16:11.303 --> 16:13.221
All right. Are there
any more questions?

16:13.347 --> 16:15.348
Do I still get
extra credit for this?

16:25.109 --> 16:26.818
Willie,
I'm gonna give you

16:26.944 --> 16:28.486
one more chance
to come on board with me.

16:28.612 --> 16:31.030
All right.
I'll give you $100,

16:31.156 --> 16:33.658
but I want 51%
of the company.

16:33.784 --> 16:36.869
You've lost your mind. I can't
give up that much equity.

16:36.996 --> 16:40.623
Sadie, you wanna buy in?
That doesn't really apply
to me, though. I can't--

16:40.749 --> 16:44.877
Yeah, but, look,
I'm gonna make women,
you know, hey.

16:45.004 --> 16:47.880
You just said,
"I'm gonna make women, hey."

16:48.007 --> 16:51.300
Okay, I'll do $101 for 51%.

16:51.427 --> 16:54.971
Boy, the lemons
don't fall far from the tree.
Deal's off!

16:55.097 --> 16:58.683
I'll just keep my company,
and, hey,
when I'm a millionaire,

16:58.809 --> 17:01.227
y'all can borrow money
from me.

17:03.772 --> 17:08.151
So I get the text that Missy,
Reed, and Brighton
are almost home.

17:08.277 --> 17:10.486
- Hey, guys, they're pulling    into the driveway.
-                 All right.

17:10.612 --> 17:13.239
I'm gonna get 'em
and bring 'em out here,
all right?

17:13.365 --> 17:16.451
Usually,
when I'm hiding and waiting
to surprise something,

17:16.577 --> 17:18.161
I'm fixin' to put that
on the dinner table.

17:18.287 --> 17:20.538
But this could be
pretty fun, too,

17:20.664 --> 17:22.540
and a little nerve-racking.

17:22.666 --> 17:24.584
Hallelujah. We are home.

17:24.710 --> 17:26.627
Congratulations!

17:26.754 --> 17:28.588
- Thank you.
-              I got it, I got it,

17:28.714 --> 17:31.674
I got it.
Reed. Hey. You did it.

17:31.800 --> 17:34.385
Brighton, welcome aboard.
Thank you.

17:34.511 --> 17:36.679
Mostly, they're probably
gonna be impressed

17:36.805 --> 17:38.848
that I planned a party at all.

17:38.974 --> 17:41.517
Come out here. I wanna
show you something. See, look.
Babe, I need to--

17:41.643 --> 17:44.520
Surprise!

17:48.525 --> 17:52.570
Good news!
So excited!

17:52.696 --> 17:56.365
Another wedding.
Congratulations.
Thank you.

17:56.492 --> 18:00.495
I'm legitimately shocked
that my dad threw us
an engagement party.

18:00.621 --> 18:03.956
He's really not the party type,
or the surprise type.

18:04.083 --> 18:06.292
Did y'all know?
You didn't know?
No, we didn't know.

18:06.418 --> 18:09.295
Really?
Aw, Daddy did good.

18:09.421 --> 18:12.381
Just wait. He might have us
dig up the cake
from the backyard.

18:13.675 --> 18:14.967
Everybody gather up here.

18:15.094 --> 18:17.970
I got
a little presentation,

18:18.097 --> 18:20.139
and what I need
everybody to do--

18:20.265 --> 18:22.266
everybody, including you, Si--

18:22.392 --> 18:25.520
is close their eyes.

18:25.646 --> 18:27.772
Keep your eyes shut.

18:29.775 --> 18:31.567
All right.
You can open your eyes.

18:31.693 --> 18:33.152
Wait.

18:33.278 --> 18:35.363
- Ahhh!
- What are you doing?

18:35.489 --> 18:41.035
Reed taught me something
throughout this process,

18:41.161 --> 18:45.039
and I realized
that my original proposal--

18:45.165 --> 18:48.876
Don't cry, babe.

18:49.002 --> 18:51.504
My original proposal
could've been better.

18:51.630 --> 18:53.840
So,

18:53.966 --> 18:56.050
after 25 years...

18:57.553 --> 19:00.388
I love you.

19:00.514 --> 19:02.473
Will you give me
another 25?

19:02.599 --> 19:04.475
Yes.

19:04.601 --> 19:07.270
I can't believe you did this.
She said yes!

19:07.396 --> 19:10.148
Aww!

19:11.817 --> 19:13.484
Thank you.
Thank you, Reed.

19:16.446 --> 19:19.907
You took me
totally off guard.
Well, that was the plan.

19:20.033 --> 19:22.660
For you to plan all of that

19:22.786 --> 19:25.079
for Reed and Brighton,
and then for me--

19:25.205 --> 19:27.373
Babe, that's
every girl's dream--

19:27.499 --> 19:30.251
to look down and see their man
on one knee.

19:30.377 --> 19:32.253
I was baring my soul here.

19:32.379 --> 19:34.839
So it wasn't easy.

19:34.965 --> 19:38.009
So, now maybe we can
quit talking about
my original proposal.

19:38.135 --> 19:40.845
I made that right.
Deal. That's a deal.

19:40.971 --> 19:43.890
It's a key thing in marriage.
You gotta make adjustments.

19:44.016 --> 19:46.350
- So I made one.
-            Thank you. Thank you.

19:49.062 --> 19:53.191
I've been married
to the same woman for 25 years,

19:53.317 --> 19:57.111
and I'm happier now
than I was at any time
in the process.

19:57.237 --> 19:59.030
Thanks for saying yes.

20:02.993 --> 20:05.077
All right. Let's pray.
Father, we love You.

20:05.204 --> 20:07.330
We're so grateful
for all the things

20:07.456 --> 20:09.373
You do in our lives,
and all the blessings.

20:09.499 --> 20:12.543
And right now,
we're just grateful
for Reed and Brighton

20:12.669 --> 20:16.214
and the relationship
that they have begun.

20:16.340 --> 20:19.467
And, Father, we ask You
to bless 'em throughout
their marriage.

20:19.593 --> 20:23.179
Through Jesus we pray.
Amen.
Amen.

20:23.305 --> 20:27.308
All right.
Let's eat some ribs.
Let's get on those ribs!

20:27.434 --> 20:29.477
<i> The great thing about</i>
<i> a family as big as ours</i>

20:29.603 --> 20:32.521
<i> is you learn a lot</i>
<i> from multiple generations.</i>

20:32.648 --> 20:35.233
<i> While it's a ridiculous idea,</i>
<i> I have to admit,</i>

20:35.359 --> 20:38.569
<i>Si taught me</i>
<i>you're never too old to create</i>
<i>something new and different.</i>

20:38.695 --> 20:41.239
<i> And even though Reed</i>
<i> is just now getting engaged,</i>

20:41.365 --> 20:44.325
<i> I think he taught Jase</i>
<i> a thing or two about romance.</i>

20:44.451 --> 20:46.994
<i> Or at least that digging</i>
<i> through the dirt</i>
<i> of a potted plant</i>

20:47.120 --> 20:50.539
<i> to find your engagement ring</i>
<i> ain't exactly romantic.</i>

20:50.666 --> 20:52.959
I'm completely surprised.
How'd this happen?

20:53.085 --> 20:55.878
The more I started thinking
about Reed's proposal,

20:56.004 --> 20:58.839
I thought, "My proposal
was pretty weak."

20:58.966 --> 21:01.592
I made you get
your hands dirty.

21:01.718 --> 21:04.011
I've never heard you
admit this before.

21:04.137 --> 21:05.888
I know.
It just kind of hit me.
I don't know.

21:06.014 --> 21:08.057
Here. You got barbecue
in your beard.

21:08.183 --> 21:10.059
Get it.

21:11.687 --> 21:15.064
Mmm.
Barbecue-flavored lips.
