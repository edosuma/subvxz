00:09.209 --> 00:10.943
What, you've never heard of
a girl who came home safe

00:10.945 --> 00:13.712
and sound after being
abducted 13 years ago?

00:13.714 --> 00:14.913
I'm Ophie by the way.

00:14.915 --> 00:15.414
I'm Bird.

00:15.416 --> 00:17.249
Bird, I thought you
were my friend.

00:17.251 --> 00:18.617
I thought you were mine.

00:18.619 --> 00:20.719
It's over with David.

00:20.721 --> 00:22.554
Fingers crossed she can
leave all of this behind

00:22.556 --> 00:25.224
like the nightmare,
I'm sure it's been.

00:25.226 --> 00:27.993
(sighing)
I love you more.

00:30.830 --> 00:34.166
♪

00:38.772 --> 00:39.671
What do you think?

00:39.673 --> 00:40.973
It's pretty cool, right?

00:40.975 --> 00:41.640
I get free slushies,

00:41.642 --> 00:45.444
and I get all the microwave
burritos that I can eat.

00:45.446 --> 00:48.580
That turns out to be
fewer than I thought.

00:48.582 --> 00:51.216
Well, I'm really
happy you're here.

00:51.218 --> 00:53.419
Not as happy as me.

00:53.421 --> 00:56.155
What I don't understand,
really, is...

00:56.157 --> 00:57.623
why you moved here.

00:57.625 --> 00:59.858
Well, the free burritos,
as I mentioned.

00:59.860 --> 01:02.461
Max, you moved here from
a different state.

01:02.463 --> 01:04.797
You got a new job,
new apartment.

01:04.799 --> 01:06.398
That's a lot of change
for somebody who

01:06.400 --> 01:07.433
only owns one t-shirt.

01:07.435 --> 01:08.767
I own more than
one t-shirt.

01:08.769 --> 01:11.703
They're just all
the same as each other.

01:11.705 --> 01:12.905
Did something happen?

01:12.907 --> 01:14.973
You can tell me
if it did.

01:14.975 --> 01:18.477
Actually, I think you're
the one person in the world

01:18.479 --> 01:19.778
that I cannot tell.

01:19.780 --> 01:21.880
Okay, well, now you
have to tell me.

01:21.882 --> 01:23.482
No, I promised I wouldn't.

01:23.484 --> 01:27.119
Max... you're
never gonna win this.

01:27.121 --> 01:27.986
We can either go
back and forth

01:27.988 --> 01:29.621
for as long as
it takes for you to tell me,

01:29.623 --> 01:31.890
or we can save us
both a lot of time,

01:31.892 --> 01:34.159
and you can
just tell me now.

01:38.164 --> 01:42.835
I moved because
I'm worried about you.

01:42.837 --> 01:43.302
Why?

01:43.304 --> 01:44.636
Is it because
of that crash guy?

01:44.638 --> 01:45.404
No, no, no.

01:45.406 --> 01:47.840
I'm not worried about him.

01:47.842 --> 01:50.075
Okay, then what?

01:50.077 --> 01:53.579
I think it--that it's
bad enough that you...

01:53.581 --> 01:57.049
lost everything in
your life once, and I just--

01:57.051 --> 02:00.319
I don't think you should have
to go through that again.

02:01.621 --> 02:04.990
Why would I have to go
through that again?

02:04.992 --> 02:08.127
If Lori showed up.

02:08.129 --> 02:10.562
What?

Max, you saw her?

02:11.899 --> 02:13.132
Mm-hmm.

02:13.134 --> 02:13.499
Where?

02:13.501 --> 02:16.702
At the gas station
off the interstate.

02:16.704 --> 02:17.803
That's why I came back.

02:17.805 --> 02:21.273
You know, I--your mom is here.

02:21.275 --> 02:23.242
I thought she left.

02:23.244 --> 02:24.476
She wants to.

02:24.478 --> 02:25.577
And she wants you
to go with her,

02:25.579 --> 02:28.947
but I wasn't sure if
that's what you wanted.

03:11.325 --> 03:13.959
Why would I steal
a piece of crap like this?

Why would you
steal anything?

Look, I've apologized.

me, that we were moving on.

03:21.101 --> 03:22.467
Well, we're not
moving on.

03:22.469 --> 03:25.604

my mom is--well,

I-I don't know where exactly,
but, um,

03:38.652 --> 03:40.519
possibly close.

03:40.521 --> 03:41.820
That's great.

03:41.822 --> 03:42.521
Thanks.

03:42.523 --> 03:43.655
I'm happy for you, really.

03:43.657 --> 03:45.557
Is there anything
I can do to help?

03:45.559 --> 03:46.158
Well, I was thinking

03:46.160 --> 03:47.793
she's probably using
a different identity now,

03:47.795 --> 03:52.497
and that maybe you knew people
who help with that?

03:54.234 --> 03:55.534
You don't like
that I'm a criminal,

03:55.536 --> 03:57.069
until you need a criminal.

03:57.071 --> 03:58.770
No, look...

04:04.877 --> 04:07.479
Look, I just wanna
find my mom, okay?

04:07.481 --> 04:09.481
I know you know what
that feels like.

04:14.487 --> 04:16.054
Send me a picture of her.

04:16.056 --> 04:17.656
I'll ask around.

04:19.359 --> 04:20.392
Thank you.

04:20.394 --> 04:21.727
But, listen,

04:22.929 --> 04:25.631
you wanna find
a criminal, ask a cop.

04:25.633 --> 04:26.498
They know all of them,

04:26.500 --> 04:28.667
and you've got
one at home.

04:30.703 --> 04:32.904
Yeah, like Elizabeth's really
gonna help me with this.

04:32.906 --> 04:36.275
She would if you didn't
treat her like the enemy.

04:36.277 --> 04:37.342
Stop pushing her away.

04:37.344 --> 04:39.678
Let her get close,
and she'll drop her guard.

04:39.680 --> 04:40.812
You'll get a lot
more out of her

04:40.814 --> 04:44.283
if you start acting
like a friend.

04:44.285 --> 04:46.051
Or even her daughter.

04:46.053 --> 04:47.653
Be careful...

04:47.655 --> 04:50.088
You're starting to
think like a criminal.

04:56.362 --> 04:58.597
(boy)
No, no, no, no, no.

04:58.599 --> 05:00.832
You're wrong, you're wrong,
you're just insane.

05:00.834 --> 05:01.433
(girl)
<i>What?</i>

05:01.435 --> 05:03.435
You're wrong, you're just
embarrassing yourself.

05:03.437 --> 05:05.203
<i>You're embarrassing yourself.</i>

05:05.205 --> 05:05.871
Grant?

05:05.873 --> 05:08.006
My sister's here,
let's ask her.

05:08.008 --> 05:09.007
Who are you talking to?

05:09.009 --> 05:11.243
Jordan Belfort
or Travis Bickle?

05:11.245 --> 05:11.677
What?

05:11.679 --> 05:13.578
Jordan Belfort
or Travis Bickle?

05:13.580 --> 05:14.346
Or Jake LaMotta.

05:14.348 --> 05:15.614
Honestly, the worst DeNiro

05:15.616 --> 05:17.049
is still better than
the best DiCaprio.

05:17.051 --> 05:20.485
<i>Uh, hello, you're</i>
<i>forgetting "The Departed."</i>

05:20.487 --> 05:20.986
No, I'm not.

05:20.988 --> 05:23.689
<i>What does</i>
<i>your sister think?</i>

05:24.190 --> 05:24.890
Me?
Yeah.

05:24.892 --> 05:27.326
Aren't you kinda
young for those movies?

05:27.328 --> 05:28.860
Hey, I'm Carter.

05:28.862 --> 05:29.828
<i>Regan.</i>

05:29.830 --> 05:30.462
Nice to meet you.

05:30.464 --> 05:32.698
Hey, you didn't tell me
you had a girlfriend.

05:33.700 --> 05:34.366
What?

05:34.368 --> 05:36.034
Why would you--
What?

05:36.036 --> 05:36.868
I gotta go.

05:36.870 --> 05:37.803
<i>Grant, it's okay.</i>

05:37.805 --> 05:39.037
See ya.
<i>Don't.</i>

05:39.039 --> 05:40.238
Why would you do that?

05:40.240 --> 05:41.106
What, what did I say?

05:41.108 --> 05:42.307
You called her my girlfriend.

05:42.309 --> 05:43.375
What do I do now?

05:43.377 --> 05:44.076
What do I say?

05:44.078 --> 05:45.310
Calm down, this is
not a big deal.

05:45.312 --> 05:47.979
What's a bigger deal than
calling someone your girlfriend,

05:47.981 --> 05:50.082
huh?

05:50.084 --> 05:51.450
I'm sorry.

05:51.452 --> 05:52.884
This is so cute.

05:52.886 --> 05:55.454
Look at you freaking out.

05:55.456 --> 05:58.390
No, but, seriously,
we can fix this.

05:58.392 --> 06:00.859
Um, okay, who is she?

06:02.228 --> 06:05.564
She's a fellow
film geek I met online.

06:05.566 --> 06:06.098
Okay.

06:06.100 --> 06:08.767
We have this sorta
informal movie club.

06:08.769 --> 06:11.403
We have discussions
that turn into debates.

06:11.405 --> 06:12.738
She's super smart.

06:12.740 --> 06:15.574
She notices a lot
of the stuff I miss.

06:15.576 --> 06:18.643
She makes me angry,
but then she makes me laugh.

06:18.645 --> 06:20.946
I can talk to her for hours.

06:20.948 --> 06:21.713
Armadillo.

06:21.715 --> 06:26.084
I hate to break it to you,
but... she's your girlfriend.

06:28.488 --> 06:30.489
Really?

06:31.290 --> 06:32.591
Yeah.

06:40.199 --> 06:41.733
(door opens)
Hey.

06:41.735 --> 06:43.835
Hey.

06:43.837 --> 06:45.404
You're up.

06:45.406 --> 06:45.837
Yeah.

06:45.839 --> 06:47.406
Looks like we're
both working late.

06:47.408 --> 06:51.777
Yeah, I caught a call on my way
out the--you don't care.

06:52.412 --> 06:54.646
No, I do.

06:54.648 --> 06:56.348
You do, since when?

06:58.384 --> 06:59.484
I don't know.

06:59.486 --> 07:00.952
Since...

07:03.790 --> 07:06.324
since you made me come down to
the police station

07:06.326 --> 07:08.093
and apologize to everyone,

07:08.095 --> 07:10.595
and I realized
that there aren't

07:10.597 --> 07:13.231
a lot of women there,
are there?

07:13.233 --> 07:13.932
That's true, there aren't.

07:13.934 --> 07:17.602
And, from what I could tell,
you're pretty high-ranking.

07:17.604 --> 07:18.103
Well, yes.

07:18.105 --> 07:20.305
And you're above
Gabe's dad, right?

07:20.307 --> 07:21.706
Yes, she is.

07:21.708 --> 07:24.843
They used to be partners,
but you've been above him

07:24.845 --> 07:26.278
for a while now, right?

07:26.280 --> 07:26.945
Uh, you're up, too.

07:26.947 --> 07:29.581
See, I thought everyone was
going to be asleep.

07:29.583 --> 07:30.048
I waited up.

07:30.050 --> 07:33.151
You've been coming in
late every night, it seems.

07:33.153 --> 07:35.253
Well, things keep
coming up at work.

07:35.255 --> 07:38.490
I just got back
from a crime scene, in fact.

07:38.492 --> 07:42.661
You know, I'd, um--I'd actually
really love to come with you

07:42.663 --> 07:44.329
to a crime scene one day.

07:44.331 --> 07:47.899
Maybe on, uh, "take your
daughter to work" day.

07:47.901 --> 07:48.667
Well, if you're serious,

07:48.669 --> 07:49.568
I could bring you
on a ride-along,

07:49.570 --> 07:54.406
but that entails being in
a squad car all day with me.

07:54.408 --> 07:56.174
Okay, when?

07:56.176 --> 07:58.109
Tomorrow is my day off.

07:58.111 --> 07:59.344
You're taking
a day off.

07:59.346 --> 07:59.911
That's great.

07:59.913 --> 08:03.748
You've been working
such long hours lately.

08:03.750 --> 08:04.449
Yeah, I feel grimy.

08:04.451 --> 08:05.784
I'm just gonna
jump in the shower.

08:05.786 --> 08:06.952
We'll talk later?

08:06.954 --> 08:08.687
Mm-hmm.

08:12.225 --> 08:14.726
Something going on
with you two?

08:14.728 --> 08:18.063
Nothing, absolutely nothing.

08:26.138 --> 08:27.038
Okay.

08:27.040 --> 08:30.375
(siren ringing)

08:30.977 --> 08:31.510
Hey.
Hey.

08:31.512 --> 08:32.911
I didn't expect
to see you today.

08:32.913 --> 08:35.547
I'm taking Carter
on a ride-along.

08:35.549 --> 08:37.616
Oh.

08:37.618 --> 08:39.017
Nice.

08:39.019 --> 08:40.785
I'll call you later.

08:43.456 --> 08:45.390
Hey, I think it's, uh,

08:45.392 --> 08:48.827
great to see you spending
some time with your mom.

08:48.829 --> 08:50.228
What?

08:50.230 --> 08:51.930
I was just saying, um,

08:51.932 --> 08:53.532
I think it's great
to see you spending

08:53.534 --> 08:55.100
some time with your mom.

08:55.102 --> 08:56.167
Elizabeth.

08:56.169 --> 08:57.602
Right, she told me that's
what you call her.

08:57.604 --> 09:00.438
That--that's what
I call her.

09:00.440 --> 09:02.407
Hey... I just wanna say

09:02.409 --> 09:04.876
I know we got off
on the wrong foot, but maybe--

09:04.878 --> 09:07.679
Now, would that be the one
where you're a creepy predator

09:07.681 --> 09:09.247
who stalks teenage girls?

09:09.249 --> 09:09.915
Hey, look, I only did--

09:09.917 --> 09:13.285
Or the one where you
prepare to arrest my mom

09:13.287 --> 09:13.985
right in front of me.

09:13.987 --> 09:16.321
I thought you were trying to
put all that behind you.

09:16.323 --> 09:17.756
I am, I just-- when
I look at your face,

09:17.758 --> 09:20.725
I have a really hard time
not picturing it in

09:20.727 --> 09:24.396
the side-view mirror
of your car watching me.

09:24.398 --> 09:26.665
Oh, somebody wants you
over there.

09:26.667 --> 09:27.799
Who?

09:27.801 --> 09:30.302

09:30.304 --> 09:32.804

Where are we?

09:37.477 --> 09:40.412
This is a tactical
training facility.

09:40.414 --> 09:43.448
This is where
the magic happens.

09:43.450 --> 09:46.818
I thought we'd be able to
go over a few basics,

09:46.820 --> 09:49.988
just in case we were
called to a crime scene.

09:52.091 --> 09:53.725
This is a battering ram.

09:53.727 --> 09:55.493
Wow, you should keep one of
those in the house

09:55.495 --> 09:58.163
in case you wanna
get into my room.

09:58.165 --> 09:58.830
Oh, I do.

09:58.832 --> 10:01.967
The most important
thing is momentum.

10:07.106 --> 10:07.973
Wow.

10:07.975 --> 10:08.540
How'd you do that?

10:08.542 --> 10:13.445
My secret is I just imagine
someone's face on the door.

10:16.482 --> 10:19.217
Bet I can imagine
whose face that was.

10:20.453 --> 10:23.421
Listen, Carter,
I'm off the clock today.

10:23.423 --> 10:26.925
Maybe you can be, too.

10:26.927 --> 10:28.693
Yeah, okay, sorry.

10:28.695 --> 10:29.461
Okay.

10:29.463 --> 10:30.662
I'll put this back.

10:30.664 --> 10:33.632
Um, can I--can I try?

10:33.634 --> 10:35.934
Yeah.

10:35.936 --> 10:37.268
Thanks.

10:37.270 --> 10:39.604
You know I'm thrilled that
we're doing this together.

10:39.606 --> 10:42.474
I was hoping that
we'd have some--

10:42.476 --> 10:45.844
(grunting)

10:46.112 --> 10:50.115
Well... now we're both
off the clock.

10:59.092 --> 11:00.659
Nobody will be here
for hours.

11:00.661 --> 11:01.359
What is her issue with me?

11:01.361 --> 11:03.595
What have I ever done except
shield her from the truth

11:03.597 --> 11:04.629
when your career was tanking.

11:04.631 --> 11:05.563
Do you have to
put it that way?

11:05.565 --> 11:07.732
In the past tense
is how I put it.

11:07.734 --> 11:09.067
Note to God, in my
next life,

11:09.069 --> 11:10.935
I do not wanna
represent writers.

11:10.937 --> 11:12.470
Good luck with that.

11:12.472 --> 11:14.506
Here.

11:14.508 --> 11:15.540
Open it.

11:15.542 --> 11:19.010
See what happiness feels like.

11:19.012 --> 11:23.281
I have always loved
your office.

11:23.283 --> 11:24.182
Very "writerly."

11:24.184 --> 11:25.950
You know, if Ernest Hemingway
had an office like this,

11:25.952 --> 11:28.086
he never would've
killed himself.

11:28.088 --> 11:29.721
Oh, this feels good.

11:29.723 --> 11:31.923
This feels really good.

11:33.159 --> 11:35.326
Yeah, and that's
just the first one.

11:35.328 --> 11:35.960
There are three more.

11:35.962 --> 11:37.829
Not counting royalties,
not counting the paperback,

11:37.831 --> 11:39.464
not counting
the best-seller bonus,

11:39.466 --> 11:42.600
and not counting...
(singing) Hollywood.

11:42.602 --> 11:44.736
Just trying to decide
when the best time

11:44.738 --> 11:46.738
to show this to
Elizabeth is.

11:46.740 --> 11:51.342
Should I do it before or after
I tell her I want a divorce?

11:52.912 --> 11:53.945
Gasp.

11:53.947 --> 11:54.746
Embellish.

11:54.748 --> 11:56.047
She's cheating on me.

11:56.049 --> 11:56.981
Double gasp.

11:56.983 --> 11:58.783
For the second time.

11:58.785 --> 11:59.651
Go on.

11:59.653 --> 12:02.120
I didn't really blame
her the first time.

12:02.122 --> 12:04.389
My career was,
as you said, tanking,

12:04.391 --> 12:06.624
and she was driving
around all night

12:06.626 --> 12:09.461
with her Latin lapdog.

12:09.463 --> 12:13.098
She was this close to leaving me
when we found Carter.

12:13.100 --> 12:13.598
Then what?

12:13.600 --> 12:15.600
Then she ended it
with him, for a minute.

12:15.602 --> 12:16.668
Then we had a big fight
about money,

12:16.670 --> 12:19.904
and next thing I know
she's "working late"

12:19.906 --> 12:22.807
and taking showers
as soon as she gets home.

12:22.809 --> 12:23.742
I just can't stand

12:23.744 --> 12:27.512
sleeping in the same bed
with her and him.

12:27.514 --> 12:30.348
But, now, I have this.

12:30.350 --> 12:31.149

to see the check.

12:34.354 --> 12:36.654
That's how she knows
how wrong she is about me.

12:36.656 --> 12:39.624
And then she gets
to take half of it.

12:39.626 --> 12:41.426

if you understood

her husband

18:01.981 --> 18:02.980
so much compassion,

18:02.982 --> 18:05.049
but yet you can't
show the same compassion
