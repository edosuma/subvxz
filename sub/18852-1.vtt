01:56.770 --> 01:59.070
Dowd. Now, what do I hate?

01:59.370 --> 02:00.370
Boring places.

02:00.410 --> 02:01.440
And?

02:01.530 --> 02:02.540
Wells that aren't pumping oil.

02:02.570 --> 02:04.120
So what's happening?

02:04.210 --> 02:05.850
Probably our people
being overly cautious.

02:05.930 --> 02:06.960
I'm sure it's nothing.

02:07.050 --> 02:08.050
It better be.

02:08.090 --> 02:09.680
I bet the whole company on this site.

02:09.770 --> 02:11.460
Well, the reserve is
several hundred feet deeper,

02:11.490 --> 02:12.570
but we have to pass through

02:12.610 --> 02:15.170
what appears to be
a large pocket of water to reach it.

02:15.250 --> 02:17.960
Water? Well, let's keep going.

02:18.050 --> 02:19.490
Is that why you called me down here?

02:19.610 --> 02:21.300
Discovering water
two miles below the surface

02:21.330 --> 02:23.160
is important, scientifically.

02:23.250 --> 02:24.640
Dowd, you're lead scientist here.

02:24.730 --> 02:26.360
- Do we care about that?
- No.

02:26.450 --> 02:27.490
If there's a water pocket,

02:27.570 --> 02:29.800
there's a possibility
of an ecosystem. Life.

02:29.890 --> 02:32.240
Okay. Actually, it's basically impossible.

02:32.330 --> 02:35.040
The water pressure
at that depth is 10,000 psi.

02:35.130 --> 02:37.200
That water is supersaturated
with nitrogen.

02:37.290 --> 02:38.580
There would be no nutrients for life.

02:38.610 --> 02:40.400
So we keep going, yes?

02:41.290 --> 02:42.960
Yeah. Punch through.

03:01.330 --> 03:02.760
Bioluminescence.

03:02.970 --> 03:04.320
There is life.

03:04.650 --> 03:05.960
No, that's...

03:06.610 --> 03:08.280
That's the reflection from our light.

03:08.810 --> 03:09.860
What was that?

03:09.890 --> 03:10.980
Warning.

03:11.010 --> 03:12.960
The bore into the pocket
destabilized the well.

03:13.050 --> 03:14.480
The pressure's rising way too fast.

03:14.570 --> 03:16.010
There's something down there.

03:16.130 --> 03:17.650
We have to shut it down. Shut it down!

04:01.530 --> 04:04.760
Something came up.
Something came up through the well!

04:22.770 --> 04:23.960
What is this thing?

04:42.210 --> 04:43.880
He's a real go-getter.

04:44.090 --> 04:45.760
He comes highly recommended.

04:45.930 --> 04:47.240
Mr. Burke!

04:48.090 --> 04:49.400
Do you have this under control?

04:49.730 --> 04:50.760
We got this one.

04:50.890 --> 04:52.700
I have a search party
looking for the other two.

04:52.730 --> 04:56.040
It is very important
that you keep your search discreet.

04:56.450 --> 04:59.240
The Department of
Fish and Wildlife will shut us down

04:59.610 --> 05:01.990
over a horned lizard,
let alone these things.

05:02.090 --> 05:04.360
Wait. Wait. Wait.
We gotta get somebody to examine it.

05:04.450 --> 05:06.320
We find out what it eats,
and needs to survive.

05:06.450 --> 05:08.480
It'll help us find the missing ones

05:08.570 --> 05:09.680
and eliminate them.

05:09.770 --> 05:11.420
Also, if there's more
where they came from,

05:11.450 --> 05:12.740
we'll know what we're dealing with.

05:12.770 --> 05:14.600
That is smart. But just you.

05:14.890 --> 05:16.440
Okay. I'm on it.

05:16.530 --> 05:18.760
We are standing
on an ocean of oil.

05:19.090 --> 05:22.710
If we keep this quiet,
we will all make out very well.

05:23.010 --> 05:24.010
Okay.

05:24.690 --> 05:25.690
I'm on it.

05:26.410 --> 05:27.650
Don't let it out of your sight.

05:42.290 --> 05:44.320
Yeah!

06:30.530 --> 06:33.240
So Terravex made
some people rich around here.

06:33.330 --> 06:35.520
Big deal. It doesn't matter.

06:35.850 --> 06:36.880
We're making do.

06:37.050 --> 06:38.980
You shouldn't cry
just 'cause you didn't get a land lease

06:39.010 --> 06:40.320
from an oil company.

06:40.490 --> 06:41.550
Who's crying?

06:41.650 --> 06:43.400
Wouldn't take money
from Terravex, anyways.

06:43.490 --> 06:44.490
They ruined this town.

06:45.490 --> 06:48.170
You're talking like you're old enough
to remember how it used to be.

06:48.330 --> 06:50.200
It was never anything to shout about.

06:50.490 --> 06:51.840
Dad was still here.

06:53.850 --> 06:55.620
I'm gonna stop
at the Loaf 'N Go on the way home.

06:55.650 --> 06:56.650
You want anything?

06:57.370 --> 07:00.040
Something with four wheels
that'll get me out of this place.

07:01.330 --> 07:02.520
Oh.

07:02.730 --> 07:04.640
You're so handsome.

07:04.730 --> 07:06.880
Where are all the girls
knocking down your door?

07:10.250 --> 07:13.440
I'm closing again tonight,
so I won't see you till tomorrow.

07:13.530 --> 07:16.840
Just one frozen pizza.
You save the other one for Rick.

07:17.290 --> 07:18.290
- Hi.
- Hi.

07:19.410 --> 07:21.760
- How you doing?
- Good. Sorry.

07:21.850 --> 07:23.320
- No.
- Okay. Bye.

07:23.410 --> 07:24.410
All right.

07:34.130 --> 07:35.130
Tripp.

07:35.410 --> 07:37.520
She said she's not
going to be home till late.

07:37.930 --> 07:39.720
Yeah? Why would that matter?

07:39.930 --> 07:42.520
You're still going to be here
when I get back?

07:45.210 --> 07:48.040
Don't you worry! I'm not going anywhere.

08:07.450 --> 08:10.800
You enjoy that a little too much.

08:10.970 --> 08:12.280
Where'd this come from?

08:13.290 --> 08:15.480
Pankeska Rock.

08:15.610 --> 08:17.440
Big accident up there at the drill site.

08:23.290 --> 08:24.920
It got late pretty quick.

08:25.010 --> 08:26.360
Let's strip it tomorrow.

08:26.490 --> 08:27.710
If I come back.

08:27.810 --> 08:30.370
Don't think you're doing me
a favor being here.

08:30.450 --> 08:31.590
I don't take charity.

08:31.690 --> 08:33.000
Neither do I.

08:38.970 --> 08:41.600
This is a 6.4 liter Hemi V-8.

08:41.809 --> 08:44.320
Probably the only piece worth anything.

08:46.130 --> 08:48.120
Go ahead, it's yours.

08:48.210 --> 08:50.320
Ha. If anyone can get it working, you can.

08:51.170 --> 08:53.280
Hey, lock up for me.

08:53.970 --> 08:56.270
Old Hulk ain't what he used to be.

09:24.050 --> 09:27.360
I got 425 horsepower for you, buddy.

09:27.690 --> 09:30.360
You're not gonna be
the prettiest thing in town,

09:31.530 --> 09:34.320
but you're going to have
the heart of an elephant in you.

09:37.730 --> 09:41.510
Outrun that volcano?
You bet we can, Mr. President.

09:48.730 --> 09:49.730
Oh.

09:50.050 --> 09:51.880
What are you doing in my truck?

09:53.410 --> 09:56.200
Yeah, I can take you
and your sister to Coachella.

09:57.410 --> 09:59.040
Oh. Sisters?

10:04.890 --> 10:06.520
Ah! Kill 'em!

10:10.370 --> 10:13.240
Ejector seat engaged.

10:15.730 --> 10:18.880
You're watching KYPN, North Dakota,

10:18.970 --> 10:20.760
your number one source for news.

10:21.090 --> 10:22.740
Local residents were awakened

10:22.770 --> 10:25.560
by a catastrophic accident
at Pankeska Rock,

10:25.650 --> 10:28.840
where Terravex Oil workers
fought a towering fire

10:28.930 --> 10:31.200
whose black smoke
still filled the morning air.

10:31.450 --> 10:34.760
Rigger Wade Coley was on the
scene when the accident happened.

10:35.890 --> 10:36.890
Ah...

10:37.770 --> 10:40.400
Well, I, uh, heard an explosion

10:40.490 --> 10:42.760
and, uh, the tower crashed, and...

10:43.090 --> 10:44.120
Dad?

10:44.410 --> 10:46.520
...guys were running and shouting,

10:46.610 --> 10:48.720
and that's really all I'm allowed to say.

10:48.930 --> 10:52.600
Why this shroud of secrecy
and silence by Terravex Oil?

10:54.610 --> 10:56.960
I just do my job.

10:57.810 --> 10:59.000
I really don't know.

10:59.090 --> 11:00.490
I can't answer any more questions.

11:00.570 --> 11:01.760
You're here?

11:35.290 --> 11:37.920
I explained to him
that the number of objects

11:38.010 --> 11:40.440
naturally occurring in
the periodic table of elements...

11:40.610 --> 11:42.160
Tripp! Hey!

11:44.050 --> 11:46.240
Oh, uh... Hey.

11:46.450 --> 11:49.800
We were matched up
for biology tutoring?

11:50.010 --> 11:52.240
And you haven't showed up
to any of the sessions?

11:52.330 --> 11:54.440
Or maybe you didn't get
the schedule? Um...

11:54.530 --> 11:56.960
It was posted in class,
and I emailed you a copy,

11:57.050 --> 11:58.360
and slid one into your locker.

11:58.690 --> 12:01.070
Yeah. I just haven't checked it yet.

12:01.170 --> 12:02.800
Oh, yeah. I mean, I get it.

12:02.890 --> 12:06.920
I go, like, days sometimes
without checking my email

12:07.010 --> 12:08.520
or going to my locker.

12:08.610 --> 12:09.610
Ho-ho!

12:09.850 --> 12:11.640
I'm Meredith, by the way.

12:12.530 --> 12:14.360
Right. Yeah, I knew that.

12:16.210 --> 12:17.320
Hey, Tripp!

12:17.530 --> 12:19.910
Hey, Sam.
How's the luckiest kid in town?

12:20.010 --> 12:21.850
You know my Dad doesn't
let me drive the merch.

12:21.890 --> 12:23.800
Plus, he's flipping out right now.

12:23.890 --> 12:24.920
What happened?

12:25.010 --> 12:26.290
You want to see something crazy?

12:30.050 --> 12:31.380
See, I'm growing out my hair, like you.

12:31.410 --> 12:33.970
Hope people don't think we're brothers.

12:34.050 --> 12:35.180
We've had trouble before,

12:35.210 --> 12:36.580
but usually it's a rock
through the window,

12:36.610 --> 12:38.560
smashed taillight, that kind of thing.

12:38.850 --> 12:39.850
Check it out.

12:39.890 --> 12:41.540
Told you you've never
seen anything like this.

12:41.570 --> 12:43.140
They ripped out the gas tanks.

12:43.170 --> 12:45.240
I mean, who would even do that?

12:45.890 --> 12:48.320
Well, it has to be vandals.

12:48.410 --> 12:50.240
Serious power tools.

12:51.130 --> 12:52.180
Tripp, you know what?

12:52.210 --> 12:56.080
I happen to have the schedule
for our tutoring right here,

12:56.210 --> 12:59.000
and it says our next sessions
are Thursday and Friday.

12:59.090 --> 13:00.090
This Friday.

13:00.250 --> 13:02.240
Uh, I have work Friday.

13:02.970 --> 13:04.480
I can come by your work!

13:04.570 --> 13:05.600
See you later, Tripp!

13:05.730 --> 13:07.560
Good to hang out with you, bro.

15:48.730 --> 15:50.760
It's on the far side. Here. Come on.

16:07.090 --> 16:09.040
- Where is it?
- It's in there.

16:09.130 --> 16:10.760
We're gonna need more guys.

16:11.370 --> 16:12.680
What is it? A bear?

16:12.850 --> 16:15.680
No. Just open it up and look.

16:16.370 --> 16:17.680
Grab that.

16:21.130 --> 16:23.360
You're going to need, like,
12 more of those things.

16:29.450 --> 16:30.800
It's in there.

16:30.970 --> 16:32.360
I don't see anything.

16:33.290 --> 16:35.240
What? No, I...

16:35.330 --> 16:37.710
No, no, no.
I trapped him in here! He had...

16:37.810 --> 16:41.120
He was huge. He had tentacles and giant

16:42.130 --> 16:43.440
eyes.

16:46.970 --> 16:49.640
You guys go on ahead. I'll handle this.

16:53.130 --> 16:54.760
Rick, I know what you're thinking,

16:54.850 --> 16:57.480
but you've got to believe me. He...

16:58.170 --> 17:00.160
He sucked all the oil out of the can!

17:00.250 --> 17:02.630
- He sucked it out.
- Are you done? Huh?

17:02.890 --> 17:04.240
I knew it.

17:04.329 --> 17:07.560
I knew it as soon as I heard
it was you on the call.

17:07.650 --> 17:09.319
I knew something wasn't gonna go right.

17:10.010 --> 17:12.310
You thought this would be funny, huh?

17:12.849 --> 17:15.480
Pranking me and my guys?
Making me look like an idiot?

17:15.770 --> 17:16.910
I saw it.

17:17.010 --> 17:18.319
Yeah. Well, I hope it was fun.

17:18.930 --> 17:22.319
You're gonna wind up just like your dad
if you don't straighten out.

17:23.490 --> 17:25.240
Don't talk about my dad.

17:28.329 --> 17:31.680
That's it for you. That's it.

17:45.130 --> 17:47.100
I feel so squeezed
in here, like trapped.

17:47.130 --> 17:49.650
Like, I might die here
if I don't get one of those scholarships,

17:49.690 --> 17:51.500
because we can't afford
an out-of-state school.

17:51.530 --> 17:53.800
But there's no way I can
imagine staying here, either.

17:53.890 --> 17:55.600
I mean, did you see
that thing on the news?

17:55.690 --> 17:57.280
About the burning well?

17:57.370 --> 17:58.560
It's like, nobody cares

17:58.650 --> 18:01.020
about how much damage they're
doing to the environment because

18:01.050 --> 18:03.510
all the money in town
comes from Terravex Oil.

18:03.650 --> 18:05.640
Hey, you know a lot about biology, right?

18:06.730 --> 18:08.880
That's what I'm tutoring you in.

18:09.130 --> 18:11.040
How often do they discover
new species?

18:11.290 --> 18:12.480
Seriously?

18:12.570 --> 18:14.320
I was just watching a show on this.

18:14.410 --> 18:16.600
Do you watch Nat Geo?

18:16.690 --> 18:17.690
No.

18:18.570 --> 18:19.570
Oh.

18:19.650 --> 18:25.560
Well, um, they said that they discover,
like, 15,000 new species every year.

18:25.810 --> 18:26.900
So, would it be possible for there to be,

18:26.930 --> 18:30.080
like, a giant sea creature
here in North Dakota?

18:31.570 --> 18:32.680
Technically, totally.

18:32.770 --> 18:35.400
This whole state was under
an ocean at one point.

18:35.650 --> 18:36.790
So theoretically,

18:36.930 --> 18:39.920
the deep lakes
could have something like that.

18:40.290 --> 18:43.120
I mean on land.
A giant sea creature on land.

18:43.410 --> 18:44.680
Well, no.

18:44.770 --> 18:48.520
Because its body evolved
in a water environment,

18:48.610 --> 18:51.140
so it wouldn't be able to move
with the effects of gravity pulling on it.

18:51.170 --> 18:52.220
Did you want to watch that show?

18:52.250 --> 18:53.920
'Cause I have it on my DVR.

18:54.410 --> 18:55.610
It's 4:00. I'll see you later.

19:37.850 --> 19:39.520
Come on.

19:42.650 --> 19:43.960
Come on.

20:38.810 --> 20:39.840
Hmm?

21:27.090 --> 21:28.400
No, no, no.

21:29.250 --> 21:30.560
Come on.

21:30.810 --> 21:32.280
Stop, stop, stop, stop!

21:33.090 --> 21:34.090
Shit.

21:43.250 --> 21:44.280
Ugh!

21:57.130 --> 21:59.320
I'm trying to help you!

22:12.810 --> 22:14.800
Let go of me! I just saved your life!

22:32.210 --> 22:34.320
See? You would have
been flat as a pancake,

22:34.450 --> 22:37.920
you squishy piece of squish!

22:58.650 --> 23:00.640
What are you?

23:17.170 --> 23:18.440
You want the oil?

23:21.330 --> 23:22.800
You promise not to eat me?

23:32.490 --> 23:34.840
Hey! Don't even touch me!

23:52.890 --> 23:54.560
You got to be kidding me.

24:01.050 --> 24:03.350
You better slow down there.

24:03.530 --> 24:05.360
You're getting all jacked up.

24:13.090 --> 24:15.520
What? You don't like that truck?

24:16.530 --> 24:18.720
Okay. Watch this.

24:22.810 --> 24:24.600
See? It can't hurt you.

24:38.890 --> 24:39.920
Ooh.

24:48.650 --> 24:49.650
Whoa!

24:55.770 --> 24:57.080
Can I help you, sir?

24:57.290 --> 24:59.120
Yeah. We're working for Terravex.

24:59.410 --> 25:01.760
We had something crash through
our fences last night.

25:01.970 --> 25:05.160
No one got a good look at it,
but it was big, whatever it was.

25:05.410 --> 25:07.690
You get any reports
of anything like that in the last day?

25:07.930 --> 25:10.360
No, dude, we haven't heard any of that.

25:10.450 --> 25:11.450
Nothing strange?

25:13.290 --> 25:15.590
No calls about seeing
some kind of big animal?

25:16.090 --> 25:18.080
There was the monster in the junkyard.

25:18.210 --> 25:19.680
Or was it a "giant creature"?

25:19.770 --> 25:21.760
Hey! Hey! Guys!

25:21.850 --> 25:23.720
What did I say? Enough about that.

25:23.810 --> 25:25.160
Well, I'd like to hear the story.

25:26.130 --> 25:27.960
Well, there's not much to tell.

25:28.050 --> 25:29.650
It was a false call. That's what it was.

25:29.690 --> 25:30.690
Where from?

25:30.770 --> 25:32.800
It's Weathers'
junkyard, off 112.

25:33.010 --> 25:35.310
Hey! We just talked about this.

25:37.490 --> 25:40.280
Look, I don't see why
you're so worked up about a prank call.

25:41.330 --> 25:43.440
I don't see why you are, either.

25:46.770 --> 25:49.230
Oh, quit being a baby.

25:54.650 --> 25:56.640
There we go.

25:56.970 --> 25:58.340
Let's get you to the sheriff's station.

25:58.370 --> 26:00.320
See what Rick has to say now.

26:19.570 --> 26:20.880
What the...

26:26.170 --> 26:28.160
Hey! Get back here!

26:37.370 --> 26:38.840
Hey! Whoa! Stop!

26:39.050 --> 26:40.720
Stay! Stay put!

26:40.890 --> 26:43.000
Stay put!

26:43.530 --> 26:44.670
Listen...

26:45.010 --> 26:46.680
Nobody's listening to me!

26:49.210 --> 26:51.920
Not so tough,
are you now, landsquid?

27:05.210 --> 27:06.880
You are so

27:08.210 --> 27:09.560
smelly.

27:10.890 --> 27:13.190
No. No, no, no.

27:19.770 --> 27:20.910
Hey!

27:23.730 --> 27:25.400
Get back here!

27:27.090 --> 27:28.880
Oh, no, no, no.

27:29.450 --> 27:31.520
If you scratch my truck, so help me!

27:45.250 --> 27:46.600
Can I help you?

27:46.810 --> 27:49.520
I understand you had
an incident last night,

27:49.610 --> 27:51.910
but the local authorities
didn't believe you.

27:52.130 --> 27:53.960
Explain why you care?

27:54.930 --> 27:56.760
We're looking for something unusual.

27:57.930 --> 27:59.120
Something dangerous.

27:59.330 --> 28:00.730
What are you looking to do with it?

28:01.290 --> 28:02.920
Make sure it doesn't hurt no one.

28:04.490 --> 28:06.580
Well, I thought
I heard something. I didn't see anything.

28:06.610 --> 28:09.560
Must have been a coyote,
or something like that.

28:09.650 --> 28:11.320
Did this coyote come back?

28:11.610 --> 28:12.610
No.

28:12.810 --> 28:13.840
Mind if we take a look?

28:13.970 --> 28:14.970
Yes, actually.

28:15.170 --> 28:19.000
Because it's private property
and you're not allowed to go in there,

28:19.810 --> 28:22.440
but, uh, go ahead
and look around, if you want to.

28:23.290 --> 28:25.800
I can make an exception this time.

28:27.330 --> 28:28.330
Oh.

28:41.970 --> 28:45.960
You know, uh, the coyote that I
saw... I heard, was, um...

28:46.330 --> 28:50.960
I think it came from that side of the yard.

28:51.250 --> 28:52.680
Uh... For sure, actually.

28:53.010 --> 28:54.120
From that side of the yard?

28:54.330 --> 28:56.040
Uh... Yeah.

29:04.330 --> 29:05.640
Stop it! Stop it!

29:06.850 --> 29:08.800
Will you stop?

29:11.410 --> 29:13.080
Search the whole place.

29:21.770 --> 29:22.770
Ah. The battery's dead.

29:22.850 --> 29:24.100
I'm going to push it over
to the other garage.

29:24.130 --> 29:26.400
You guys just keep looking around.

29:38.130 --> 29:39.130
Hey!

29:40.930 --> 29:43.040
Give me back my truck!

29:56.410 --> 29:57.410
Hey!

30:04.450 --> 30:06.720
Give me back my truck!

30:10.010 --> 30:11.200
Tripp?

30:13.370 --> 30:15.520
I made flash cards!

30:16.250 --> 30:17.250
Meredith?

30:18.810 --> 30:19.950
What are you...

30:20.290 --> 30:23.240
Look, seriously, now is a really bad time.

30:23.890 --> 30:25.030
Oh, okay.

30:27.210 --> 30:28.920
Do you think you could
give me a ride home?

30:29.010 --> 30:30.050
I don't live too far away.

30:30.130 --> 30:32.640
But it was kind
of a scary walk in the dark.

30:33.370 --> 30:34.590
I, uh... I don't have a car.

30:37.850 --> 30:39.640
It doesn't run.

30:42.050 --> 30:43.400
It's not...

30:45.570 --> 30:48.400
Uh... Can you, uh, just go home?

30:48.690 --> 30:49.690
Please.

30:51.330 --> 30:53.790
It's kind of rude of you
not to give me a ride home.

30:53.890 --> 30:56.270
I came all the way over here
on Friday night

30:56.370 --> 30:58.160
to help you study,

30:58.410 --> 30:59.760
and you're just sending me away?

30:59.850 --> 31:02.000
How would you feel
if I got abducted on my way home?

31:02.330 --> 31:03.800
Who's gonna abduct you?

31:05.250 --> 31:06.560
It's not what I mean.

31:06.850 --> 31:08.840
It just... It doesn't happen out here.

31:12.410 --> 31:13.550
What was that?

31:13.690 --> 31:14.720
I heard it, too.

31:15.170 --> 31:16.170
Hey, kid!

31:16.250 --> 31:18.600
You should probably put that in park.

31:21.250 --> 31:23.080
Hey! Why don't you just get in the truck?

31:23.170 --> 31:25.440
- Really?
- Yeah. Just get in.

31:25.530 --> 31:26.530
Oh...

31:27.170 --> 31:28.390
Whoop! Oh!

31:32.850 --> 31:35.440
Listen, there's something going on here.

31:36.170 --> 31:37.200
Really?

31:37.450 --> 31:38.510
Yeah, something crazy.

31:38.610 --> 31:40.760
And I don't even know
how to begin to explain it.

31:40.850 --> 31:42.840
You don't have to. I mean...

31:44.130 --> 31:45.880
I feel it, too.

31:46.770 --> 31:47.880
Uh, no...

31:49.130 --> 31:51.200
There's...

31:51.290 --> 31:53.800
Just go if you're going to go!

31:55.330 --> 31:56.330
Go!

31:59.730 --> 32:01.010
That kid knows something.

32:02.490 --> 32:04.490
You know, I can drive manual
if you don't know how.

32:11.410 --> 32:13.970
Okay. Well, at the end of the hill,
turn right.

32:18.490 --> 32:20.280
Right! I said right!

32:20.370 --> 32:21.370
I'm trying!

32:27.250 --> 32:29.160
- Stop the car!
- I can't! Nothing's working.

32:29.250 --> 32:30.250
Ah!

32:31.290 --> 32:33.400
- Put your hands on the wheel!
- I...

32:36.170 --> 32:37.360
This isn't doing anything!

32:37.450 --> 32:38.670
Yeah. I know!

32:38.770 --> 32:40.280
Whoa...

32:42.530 --> 32:43.840
Tree, tree, tree!

32:58.770 --> 33:00.450
There's a paved road
that goes to my house.

33:13.650 --> 33:16.000
Do you even have your license?

33:16.970 --> 33:17.970
Shh.

33:30.370 --> 33:34.360
Did you just steal this?
Did we just steal this?

33:34.690 --> 33:36.840
Okay, get out!

33:39.010 --> 33:40.360
You hear me?

33:41.730 --> 33:42.730
Get out!

33:42.970 --> 33:45.320
You were the one
who pushed me into your truck!

33:45.650 --> 33:47.480
Give me my truck back!

33:48.010 --> 33:49.640
Who are you talking to?

33:50.170 --> 33:51.170
That!

33:52.610 --> 33:53.610
Whoa!

33:54.490 --> 33:55.630
Whoa! Was that a snake?

33:57.530 --> 33:59.200
Tripp, what is that?

34:01.890 --> 34:03.680
Take a look and see.

34:03.810 --> 34:05.760
Take a look?

34:07.370 --> 34:08.719
He won't hurt you.

34:29.850 --> 34:30.850
What!

34:31.730 --> 34:33.920
Oh, my gosh. What is that?

34:34.409 --> 34:35.469
Tripp!

34:35.650 --> 34:37.320
Ah! Fine, just keep the truck!

34:37.770 --> 34:40.360
You said you live close, right? Let's go.

34:42.370 --> 34:43.429
Are you just gonna...

34:43.530 --> 34:45.560
I mean, seriously, Tripp, what...

34:47.330 --> 34:50.679
It's, uh, moving the truck.

34:56.010 --> 34:57.010
Okay.

34:58.770 --> 35:01.070
My dad barely comes in here,

35:02.090 --> 35:03.760
so you should be fine for the night.

35:05.010 --> 35:07.360
Think he'd mind if
I borrowed some of this stuff?

35:08.050 --> 35:09.600
I'll pay him back.

35:10.050 --> 35:12.840
I doubt he'd even notice. But for what?

35:12.970 --> 35:16.200
So I can pry Creature here
out of my truck.

35:16.290 --> 35:17.680
Good luck with that.

35:19.130 --> 35:22.960
Yeah. My curfew is in, like,
two minutes, so...

35:28.450 --> 35:31.120
Thank you for the incredibly weird night!

35:33.970 --> 35:35.800
Please don't let it near my horse.

35:37.650 --> 35:38.790
Okay.

35:51.770 --> 35:52.770
Hey, hey, hey!

35:52.810 --> 35:54.320
Sit still, would you?

35:55.730 --> 35:57.000
Hey!

36:09.970 --> 36:11.110
Oh.

36:18.970 --> 36:19.970
Huh.

37:37.610 --> 37:40.840
Now, it's not just this one pocket
that's blocking our oil.

37:41.450 --> 37:44.920
It is a massive,
interconnected ecosystem,

37:45.010 --> 37:46.440
untouched for millions of years.

37:46.690 --> 37:48.280
I mean, it's basically a certainty

37:48.370 --> 37:50.100
that there are more of
those things down there.

37:50.130 --> 37:52.430
Prehistoric amphibians,
that can breathe water or air,

37:52.530 --> 37:54.220
living in a network
of underground lakes and caves.

37:54.250 --> 37:56.880
It's like the Loch Ness Monster
isn't a myth after all.

37:57.130 --> 37:58.520
Can we access it?

37:58.610 --> 38:00.960
Well, there's a crater lake
on the surface,

38:01.050 --> 38:04.200
and, yeah, the vents that feed the lake
lead directly down there.

38:04.450 --> 38:05.930
- Could we get equipment there?
- Hmm.

38:06.210 --> 38:08.560
Well, it was a pretty rough drive
in my Jeep.

38:09.050 --> 38:11.000
There's a good dirt road
after the strip mine,

38:11.090 --> 38:13.120
but after that it's all off-road.

38:14.810 --> 38:16.120
Good job.

38:16.450 --> 38:18.800
What about our POWs?

38:19.610 --> 38:21.080
Well, we're still working on it,

38:21.210 --> 38:24.880
but if that third one
is alive out there somewhere,

38:24.970 --> 38:26.320
we'll find it.

38:36.250 --> 38:39.520
Stop! Stop. Give me some space.

38:42.330 --> 38:44.320
- Morning.
- Morning.

38:44.490 --> 38:46.840
So, instead of getting him out of there,

38:46.930 --> 38:49.000
you built more stuff to keep him in.

38:49.090 --> 38:51.240
This thing is kind of awesome.

38:51.330 --> 38:53.400
Like, strong and smart. Really smart.

38:53.490 --> 38:55.600
He can learn anything, fast.

38:57.810 --> 39:00.040
Oh, and I gave him a name.
Isn't that right, Creech?

39:00.130 --> 39:02.200
You named him Creech?

39:02.290 --> 39:06.560
He's got these
hair-like things on its tentacles.

39:07.210 --> 39:08.640
Cilia, right?

39:09.370 --> 39:11.830
They can generate
a massive amount of torque,

39:11.930 --> 39:13.290
especially once I scored the axles

39:13.330 --> 39:15.000
to make more surface area to grip.

39:15.130 --> 39:16.160
And that's at each tire.

39:16.250 --> 39:17.300
So, imagine the angular velocity

39:17.330 --> 39:19.480
when it's not all spread out
from one differential.

39:21.010 --> 39:22.320
You're not dumb.

39:22.650 --> 39:23.650
What?

39:24.050 --> 39:25.050
Nothing.

39:26.130 --> 39:27.130
Um...

39:27.530 --> 39:28.670
So...

39:29.810 --> 39:31.600
I press the gas,

39:31.730 --> 39:35.720
the throttle wire pulls these levers,
which open these blinders.

39:41.650 --> 39:43.640
Right? Right?

39:43.970 --> 39:45.110
It's like

39:46.290 --> 39:48.320
the truck's a wheelchair for it.

39:49.530 --> 39:52.280
Uh, no. It's like...

39:53.650 --> 39:56.800
It is an engine for my truck.

40:00.410 --> 40:01.410
Watch.

40:16.570 --> 40:18.080
Yes! Yes! Yes!

40:27.010 --> 40:28.360
Did you see that?

40:35.010 --> 40:36.520
Okay.

40:38.850 --> 40:39.850
Hey!

40:41.210 --> 40:42.840
See, it's not so hard.

40:44.530 --> 40:45.840
Okay.

40:47.610 --> 40:48.610
Come on.

41:16.650 --> 41:17.960
You got it!

41:19.930 --> 41:20.930
Whoo!

41:24.890 --> 41:25.890
Show-off!

41:45.330 --> 41:46.330
No way!

41:47.690 --> 41:49.120
Whoa!

41:52.770 --> 41:54.280
Lift this up, would you?

42:03.930 --> 42:05.360
Stop.

42:24.890 --> 42:27.270
But this thing
is important, right?

42:27.810 --> 42:29.120
Shouldn't we tell somebody?

42:29.370 --> 42:31.500
You think he'll be better off
with somebody poking at him,

42:31.530 --> 42:32.620
trying to figure out what he is?

42:32.650 --> 42:35.480
First of all, how do you
know that it's a "he"?

42:35.730 --> 42:38.880
And secondly,
as a Youth for Animal Rights activist,

42:38.970 --> 42:42.040
I feel responsible
for the well-being of that animal.

42:43.170 --> 42:44.960
He's fine. He's happy.

42:48.530 --> 42:49.530
Hey!

42:50.250 --> 42:51.560
Hey, stop!

42:51.730 --> 42:54.160
I'm just saying,
he came from somewhere.

42:54.250 --> 42:55.310
He has a home.

42:55.410 --> 42:57.240
Don't you think
he wants to go back there?

42:57.330 --> 42:59.840
Sure,
but he's safe in here in the meantime.

42:59.930 --> 43:01.680
Besides, he's having fun.

43:02.010 --> 43:05.000
He's like a kid with his first tricycle.

43:06.610 --> 43:08.320
I'm going to see my dad at Pankeska.

43:08.610 --> 43:11.440
Was he at Pankeska Rock
when that accident happened?

43:12.330 --> 43:13.390
Yeah.

43:15.610 --> 43:16.850
I'm coming with you.

43:26.010 --> 43:28.200
Okay, Creech, let's get you fed.

43:35.970 --> 43:37.360
I'll get you back.

43:46.770 --> 43:47.770
Uh...

43:50.050 --> 43:51.190
Great.

44:07.930 --> 44:08.930
Hey.

44:09.930 --> 44:10.930
Hey.

44:12.570 --> 44:14.080
I like your truck.

44:17.090 --> 44:18.400
What is this?

44:18.730 --> 44:20.560
You know what this looks like?

44:21.090 --> 44:24.160
This looks like
if a garbage truck took a dump.

44:25.410 --> 44:29.080
And not like a normal dump.
Like a really bad one.

44:29.410 --> 44:30.760
That's what this looks like.

44:33.770 --> 44:35.760
- Thanks.
- Anytime.

44:38.890 --> 44:39.890
Ouch.

45:06.730 --> 45:07.790
That sound weird to you?

45:09.450 --> 45:11.360
How is a monster living
in the hood of your car

45:11.450 --> 45:12.450
supposed to sound?

45:13.050 --> 45:14.480
He's probably fine.

45:16.170 --> 45:18.400
Um... Okay. Why is he moving like this?

45:18.570 --> 45:20.080
I don't know. He's hyper.

45:20.170 --> 45:21.690
Why would he be hyper all of a sudden?

45:23.650 --> 45:26.800
It's what he ate.
Gasoline is oil, but with...

45:27.170 --> 45:28.480
Added chemicals!

45:36.210 --> 45:37.240
What the...

45:37.330 --> 45:39.760
Okay. I think now is
a good time to take charge.

45:39.890 --> 45:41.250
Let go! I can see better than you.

45:44.450 --> 45:45.480
Uh...

45:46.490 --> 45:49.280
Hey, what are you doing?
Get back in there!

45:50.970 --> 45:52.030
Tripp! Tripp! Watch out!

45:52.250 --> 45:53.610
Oh, no. What are you doing?

45:55.650 --> 45:57.680
No, no, no!

46:00.170 --> 46:02.550
Get back in there! I'm driving!

46:06.090 --> 46:07.720
I said, let go!

46:08.690 --> 46:10.920
Oh, gosh, I touched his eye!

46:22.690 --> 46:23.750
No, no, no.

46:23.890 --> 46:26.880
Watch me unload this lemon
on Old Man Overalls here.

46:29.810 --> 46:31.000
No! No! No!

46:39.210 --> 46:40.680
Okay. Right!

46:49.810 --> 46:50.810
Sorry.

46:51.250 --> 46:52.920
Okay, new rule,

46:53.010 --> 46:54.600
no feeding Creature gasoline.

46:57.250 --> 47:00.400
So, you don't like
the bacteria cultures, huh?

47:01.250 --> 47:03.080
How about nematodes?

47:09.570 --> 47:11.160
Don't like those, either.

47:12.730 --> 47:13.730
Hmm.

47:14.490 --> 47:15.680
Well...

47:20.410 --> 47:22.920
You must eat something
out there under those oil beds.

47:47.210 --> 47:48.210
Hi.

48:16.170 --> 48:17.230
Dad?

48:18.970 --> 48:20.320
Hey, Dad.

48:21.010 --> 48:22.320
It's Tripp.

48:23.010 --> 48:24.230
Tripp.

48:25.650 --> 48:28.480
Well, it sure is. Look at you.

48:29.330 --> 48:31.400
Ah. Don't want to get
my grime all over you.

48:31.490 --> 48:32.490
Right.

48:34.490 --> 48:35.490
This yours?

48:37.890 --> 48:38.890
Yeah.

48:38.970 --> 48:41.600
The truck, not the girl.
I figured the girl's yours.

48:41.690 --> 48:43.320
No. Not really.

48:43.410 --> 48:45.320
Hi. I'm Meredith.

48:45.930 --> 48:47.150
Wade.

48:47.890 --> 48:49.200
This is something.

48:49.690 --> 48:51.000
This is solid.

48:51.850 --> 48:52.910
This is solid work.

48:53.530 --> 48:54.670
Yeah. Thanks.

48:55.210 --> 48:56.520
Come on up.

48:56.610 --> 48:58.520
Why don't you park it at my trailer?

48:58.610 --> 49:00.940
I'm just gonna call my guys,
tell them I won't be at the bar.

49:00.970 --> 49:01.970
Yeah.

49:07.890 --> 49:12.040
It's small, but it's a roof and a bed.

49:12.370 --> 49:14.080
It's only temporary for work, right?

49:14.170 --> 49:16.760
I mean, you have
a permanent place somewhere?

49:16.930 --> 49:19.200
Uh, yeah, well, this does the job.

49:19.450 --> 49:21.320
I'm not inside much, anyway.

49:21.410 --> 49:23.760
They got us working 12-hour shifts.

49:25.210 --> 49:29.200
Were you working when,
uh, that accident happened?

49:30.210 --> 49:31.210
Oh, yeah.

49:31.490 --> 49:34.050
There's all these rumors
I read online about it.

49:34.130 --> 49:35.320
What happened?

49:38.410 --> 49:40.520
This stays in here, all right?

49:40.610 --> 49:41.640
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

49:41.730 --> 49:45.080
They drug something
out of the ground that night.

49:45.890 --> 49:47.920
Pushed so far down,

49:48.730 --> 49:53.480
it was like the earth got mad
and let something bad out.

49:57.770 --> 49:59.180
But they say it was a pocket of gas,

49:59.210 --> 50:01.840
so I guess it was a pocket of gas, huh?

50:01.930 --> 50:02.930
Yeah.

50:04.010 --> 50:05.530
What do I know?

50:06.410 --> 50:07.410
Right?

50:10.930 --> 50:12.920
I left something on the bus.

50:13.770 --> 50:15.520
You guys stay here, I'll be right back.

50:15.610 --> 50:16.830
We'll have some wings.

50:19.770 --> 50:22.960
Well, at least we know
where that thing came from.

50:24.690 --> 50:27.520
Those guys the other night
must have been from Terravex.

50:28.850 --> 50:31.200
They don't want
anyone to know about the creature.

50:31.290 --> 50:32.730
Well, they wouldn't be able to drill

50:32.850 --> 50:36.840
if there was some new species
living on top of the oil.

50:38.730 --> 50:39.920
I'm gonna go check on him.

50:40.010 --> 50:42.800
Probably not good
to leave him alone long.

50:46.970 --> 50:48.110
Dad?

50:48.890 --> 50:51.270
These men want to have
a word with you, Tripp.

50:51.410 --> 50:52.520
They want their truck back.

50:52.890 --> 50:54.880
Their truck? I built that!

50:54.970 --> 50:56.960
Look. Your mother called me last night.

50:57.050 --> 50:58.480
She saw me on TV,

50:58.570 --> 51:01.240
thought you'd maybe come up here
and try to find me.

51:01.330 --> 51:03.160
You sold me out. To them.

51:03.250 --> 51:04.460
I'm not selling you out to no one.

51:04.490 --> 51:05.680
I just wanna do what's best.

51:06.890 --> 51:08.240
For who?

51:08.410 --> 51:10.480
- We just want to talk to you, son.
- Watch it!

51:10.570 --> 51:11.620
I'm not going anywhere with you!

51:11.650 --> 51:13.160
Yes, you are.

51:13.250 --> 51:14.340
Just listen to him, Tripp.

51:14.370 --> 51:15.840
You're not the police.

51:15.930 --> 51:17.300
You don't have the right to take him.

51:17.330 --> 51:20.000
This is private property.
Our private property.

51:20.090 --> 51:21.560
Get off of me!

51:31.850 --> 51:34.150
Get in the truck. Get in the truck.

51:37.850 --> 51:39.360
I'll hurt you, kid.

51:41.010 --> 51:42.120
I will.

51:55.050 --> 51:57.800
It's the truck! That thing is in the truck!

51:59.450 --> 52:01.480
Yeah, I'm just pulling in now.

52:01.570 --> 52:03.360
Listen, I don't want you to worry, okay?

52:03.450 --> 52:05.440
If he's here, I'll have him home by dinner.

52:12.810 --> 52:14.760
Move over! I'm driving!

52:15.450 --> 52:17.240
Oh, really?

52:21.490 --> 52:22.800
I gotta go.

52:31.890 --> 52:33.080
Tripp?

52:45.330 --> 52:47.400
Whoo!

52:47.490 --> 52:48.490
Yes!

52:51.850 --> 52:52.910
Tripp!

53:01.090 --> 53:03.360
What the heck is going on here?

53:07.690 --> 53:08.750
Big truck,

53:08.850 --> 53:10.120
big truck, big truck!

53:12.490 --> 53:13.490
Tripp.

53:13.610 --> 53:16.280
No. I'm not stopping
and I'm not giving up the truck.

53:16.370 --> 53:18.280
No. Go faster!

53:36.650 --> 53:37.710
Okay. We got him.

53:38.130 --> 53:40.560
Fan out. Cut him off.
Don't let him out of town.

53:59.010 --> 54:01.280
- We're not gonna fit.
- I think we can do it.

54:06.410 --> 54:07.550
It worked!

54:14.570 --> 54:16.040
Move! Go!

54:23.850 --> 54:24.850
Whoa!

54:48.090 --> 54:49.280
What?

54:55.250 --> 54:57.920
Did you train him to do this?

54:58.770 --> 54:59.910
Yes.

55:02.010 --> 55:03.010
Ah...

55:03.450 --> 55:05.600
I have no idea how he learned this.

55:22.770 --> 55:23.880
Did that just happen?

55:23.970 --> 55:25.000
Oh, yeah, it did!

55:30.570 --> 55:31.570
Uh...

55:37.130 --> 55:38.440
Wall!

55:38.650 --> 55:39.960
Watch this.

55:47.010 --> 55:48.010
Oh!

55:53.410 --> 55:55.280
Oh... We're driving on a roof.

55:55.370 --> 55:57.480
Get out of our way, pigeons!

56:06.170 --> 56:08.440
Whoa! Did you see that?

56:16.010 --> 56:17.150
Hang on!

56:17.330 --> 56:18.330
No way.

56:18.490 --> 56:20.520
I want to stay on the roof now!

56:31.730 --> 56:33.720
Did you hear that? The train.

56:34.010 --> 56:35.200
So what?

56:35.530 --> 56:36.580
That thing is five miles long.

56:36.610 --> 56:37.900
If we can put that
in between us and them,

56:37.930 --> 56:39.680
we'll get a 10 minute head start.

56:40.170 --> 56:42.000
Oh. How about a plan B?

56:42.090 --> 56:43.680
No time for a plan B.

56:43.890 --> 56:46.240
Besides, I think we lost them.

57:18.410 --> 57:19.540
Tripp, I don't think
we're going to make it.

57:19.570 --> 57:20.630
We'll make it!

57:22.450 --> 57:24.280
We're not going fast enough!

57:29.170 --> 57:30.230
Slow down!

57:30.570 --> 57:31.570
Brakes!

57:33.090 --> 57:34.090
Tripp!

57:56.210 --> 57:58.480
Yeah! Way to go, Creech!

58:02.450 --> 58:05.040
Hey! What are you doing,
chasing that boy all over my county?

58:05.130 --> 58:06.500
It's a private company security matter!

58:06.530 --> 58:08.040
You're putting lives in danger.

58:08.130 --> 58:09.620
You're interfering with law enforcement!

58:09.650 --> 58:12.560
The company I'm working for
employs everyone in this town,

58:12.650 --> 58:14.520
and that includes you!

58:14.610 --> 58:17.120
When's the next election, Sheriff?

58:17.450 --> 58:19.750
Go back to writing tickets
and shooing cows off the road.

58:36.250 --> 58:38.320
You really saved me back there.

58:38.410 --> 58:41.480
Thanks, you big, ugly, beautiful blob.

58:41.570 --> 58:45.080
My dad only uses this
during hunting season, so...

58:45.170 --> 58:47.320
- You said there was oil?
- Yeah.

58:47.410 --> 58:50.920
But it's for the generator,
so we won't have electricity.

58:53.170 --> 58:55.470
That's okay. He deserves it.

59:03.170 --> 59:04.680
It's nicer out here.

59:06.090 --> 59:07.760
Yeah, I don't mind.

59:13.170 --> 59:14.560
Are you scared of fire?

59:16.530 --> 59:18.760
I would be, too, if I drank oil.

59:25.450 --> 59:27.520
Tripp, I'm sorry about your dad.

59:28.770 --> 59:31.480
It would have been a lousy
place to stay, anyways.

59:32.850 --> 59:34.120
I mean,

59:34.930 --> 59:35.980
how weird would it have been

59:36.010 --> 59:38.440
if he'd turned out
to be a decent guy, right?

59:38.530 --> 59:39.800
What would that have been like?

59:43.130 --> 59:44.960
You wouldn't be who you are.

59:45.970 --> 59:50.640
And there's no one like you
at our school.

59:51.290 --> 59:52.880
Or in our town.

59:55.970 --> 59:57.110
So,

01:00:02.050 --> 01:00:04.240
that's something to
thank your dad for, at least.

01:00:54.050 --> 01:00:55.360
God!

01:01:05.810 --> 01:01:08.040
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
where are you going?

01:01:11.610 --> 01:01:12.610
Hey, hey.

01:01:12.690 --> 01:01:14.120
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:01:16.570 --> 01:01:18.040
Hey. What are you doing?

01:01:22.170 --> 01:01:23.170
Hey.

01:01:26.330 --> 01:01:27.330
No.

01:02:25.130 --> 01:02:26.800
I'm going to get you home.

01:02:27.370 --> 01:02:28.960
I promise you that.

01:02:34.370 --> 01:02:35.720
Thank you.

01:02:37.810 --> 01:02:39.280
I love you, too.

01:02:40.130 --> 01:02:42.120
Ready? Watch.

01:03:06.330 --> 01:03:08.080
You could teach a mouse how to do that.

01:03:08.330 --> 01:03:12.080
That's not the amazing part.
This is the amazing part.

01:03:31.530 --> 01:03:33.990
I didn't teach that one
to do that for the oil.

01:03:34.370 --> 01:03:37.280
I taught that one
how to do that for the oil.

01:03:37.850 --> 01:03:40.680
They have hive intelligence,
like, um, ants or bees.

01:03:40.770 --> 01:03:42.050
When they're in close proximity,

01:03:42.130 --> 01:03:43.580
one of them knows
what the other knows,

01:03:43.610 --> 01:03:44.750
almost immediately.

01:03:44.890 --> 01:03:49.320
And they metabolize oil
like a combustion engine.

01:03:50.890 --> 01:03:52.720
Dowd, what are you doing?

01:03:54.650 --> 01:03:56.800
I'm a scientist.

01:03:56.890 --> 01:03:58.560
- I'm being a scientist.
- No.

01:03:58.890 --> 01:04:01.240
You are falling in love.

01:04:01.330 --> 01:04:03.560
This is some sort of
Stockholm syndrome.

01:04:04.410 --> 01:04:05.720
That's backwards.

01:04:06.050 --> 01:04:07.050
- Whatever.
- Okay.

01:04:07.130 --> 01:04:10.720
Look, in two days,
our wastewater goes to Ohio.

01:04:10.810 --> 01:04:12.960
The mucous twins go with.

01:04:13.250 --> 01:04:16.400
Going to shoot it down deep
into an injection well.

01:04:17.250 --> 01:04:18.390
No trace.

01:04:19.250 --> 01:04:22.870
No. They're not like
mindless ground slugs.

01:04:23.250 --> 01:04:25.550
They have intelligence,
they show emotion.

01:04:26.330 --> 01:04:28.320
It would be unethical to kill them.

01:04:28.570 --> 01:04:29.630
Unethical?

01:04:31.250 --> 01:04:33.760
Dowd, you and I have been
together a long time.

01:04:34.890 --> 01:04:37.320
I have seen you stretch the truth,

01:04:37.410 --> 01:04:39.920
falsify environmental protection reports,

01:04:40.250 --> 01:04:41.920
and lie to the media.

01:04:42.850 --> 01:04:44.600
We are in this together.

01:04:45.730 --> 01:04:47.400
Cheer up.

01:04:48.250 --> 01:04:50.440
And keep those things quiet!

01:05:13.130 --> 01:05:14.800
Tripp. Tripp!

01:05:15.130 --> 01:05:16.190
What are you doing?

01:05:16.290 --> 01:05:17.290
He's gone.

01:05:21.810 --> 01:05:23.120
Creech!

01:05:39.250 --> 01:05:40.880
Why would he leave?

01:05:41.250 --> 01:05:44.240
I don't know,
but we better find him before they do.

01:05:44.490 --> 01:05:46.520
Yeah, well, he took off
with my cell phone,

01:05:46.610 --> 01:05:48.990
so I can't even call anybody
to come pick us up.

01:05:49.330 --> 01:05:50.920
It's okay. I have mine.

01:05:51.330 --> 01:05:53.080
Wait, your cell phone's in the truck?

01:05:53.170 --> 01:05:54.170
Yeah.

01:05:55.330 --> 01:05:59.080
I have an app. We can track him.

01:06:06.090 --> 01:06:07.440
There he is.

01:06:07.850 --> 01:06:09.160
Where is he going?

01:06:09.250 --> 01:06:10.520
I don't know.

01:06:13.690 --> 01:06:15.680
It's here. Stop, stop here.

01:06:20.690 --> 01:06:22.360
Wait. Terravex?

01:06:22.770 --> 01:06:24.280
Are you sure this is far enough?

01:06:24.530 --> 01:06:26.690
Would you mind dropping us off
at the end of the block?

01:06:55.490 --> 01:06:56.490
He's not there.

01:06:58.730 --> 01:07:00.560
Maybe he went inside.

01:07:58.970 --> 01:08:00.110
What is that?

01:08:02.290 --> 01:08:03.640
I don't know.

01:08:14.650 --> 01:08:16.479
He came here for them.

01:08:17.410 --> 01:08:19.040
That's why he left.

01:08:26.649 --> 01:08:28.160
No, don't! Don't!

01:08:29.170 --> 01:08:31.319
Hey, guys, check on warehouse three.

01:08:32.330 --> 01:08:35.000
No! Stop! Stop!

01:08:39.649 --> 01:08:41.120
Slow it down. Tranquilize it!

01:08:41.210 --> 01:08:42.210
No!

01:08:45.930 --> 01:08:47.760
- Hey! Stop.
- Shoot it!

01:08:50.850 --> 01:08:51.850
Stop!

01:08:51.930 --> 01:08:53.520
Stop! You're killing him!

01:09:10.010 --> 01:09:11.359
Scrape it up.

01:09:16.450 --> 01:09:17.760
Bring them with me.

01:09:32.210 --> 01:09:34.720
Well, you certainly love your cats.

01:09:34.970 --> 01:09:36.560
It's all cats.

01:09:37.569 --> 01:09:39.560
Oh! Here we go.

01:09:40.890 --> 01:09:43.560
Delete. Delete. Delete.

01:09:45.569 --> 01:09:46.880
Delete.

01:09:47.569 --> 01:09:48.569
Thank you.

01:09:48.890 --> 01:09:51.090
You can't just delete pictures
and think this goes away.

01:09:52.250 --> 01:09:54.160
Why? What are you going to do?

01:09:54.250 --> 01:09:55.450
Go to the police and tell them

01:09:55.490 --> 01:09:57.920
that there are monsters
coming up out of the oil fields?

01:09:59.170 --> 01:10:01.630
How'd that work out for you last time?

01:10:02.250 --> 01:10:03.390
Look.

01:10:04.250 --> 01:10:07.760
Hurting people, is not my thing.

01:10:10.090 --> 01:10:11.400
It's his.

01:10:14.410 --> 01:10:15.920
Mr. Burke,

01:10:16.250 --> 01:10:18.080
show these two the highway.

01:10:20.610 --> 01:10:21.920
Let's go!

01:10:22.930 --> 01:10:24.150
To your left.

01:10:24.290 --> 01:10:27.680
Okay! I'll take them from here.
Thanks, Charlie.

01:10:28.770 --> 01:10:30.410
Tenneson's orders. So, it all checks out.

01:10:30.450 --> 01:10:31.500
Just keep walking normally.

01:10:31.530 --> 01:10:33.600
Get your hands off us, slimebag.

01:10:33.690 --> 01:10:36.040
Okay, it's not slime, it's sweat.
I sweat when I'm nervous.

01:10:36.130 --> 01:10:38.360
Thanks for calling attention to it. Look.

01:10:38.450 --> 01:10:40.200
- I'm on your side.
- What?

01:10:40.290 --> 01:10:41.600
Spiritually.

01:10:42.130 --> 01:10:43.440
Okay, I'm messing this up.

01:10:43.530 --> 01:10:45.600
Sorry. I'm a scientist, a geologist.

01:10:45.970 --> 01:10:47.440
But I want to help you.

01:10:48.290 --> 01:10:49.430
Why?

01:10:49.810 --> 01:10:52.600
Because I can't just stand here
and watch them die.

01:10:55.290 --> 01:10:57.120
And why should we trust you?

01:10:57.490 --> 01:10:58.580
Because these creatures are special.

01:10:58.610 --> 01:11:00.400
I think that you've seen that, too.

01:11:00.650 --> 01:11:01.650
Now,

01:11:02.650 --> 01:11:05.960
I've done some bad things
for this company. But this...

01:11:06.330 --> 01:11:08.360
No way. Okay?

01:11:08.450 --> 01:11:10.640
I'm done doing their dirty work.

01:11:10.890 --> 01:11:12.640
Okay, then help us get them out of here.

01:11:12.730 --> 01:11:13.730
We need to get them home.

01:11:13.970 --> 01:11:14.970
It's not that simple.

01:11:15.090 --> 01:11:17.360
Okay. It's 50 miles of rough terrain
back to the vent.

01:11:17.450 --> 01:11:18.500
Any truck big enough to carry them

01:11:18.530 --> 01:11:20.400
would be too slow and we'd get caught.

01:11:20.490 --> 01:11:23.560
I got a truck fast enough.
We just gotta find two more.

01:11:27.010 --> 01:11:29.840
If you think we can do this, I'm in.

01:11:30.170 --> 01:11:31.170
We can.

01:11:33.530 --> 01:11:34.590
Okay, hands in.

01:11:35.330 --> 01:11:38.040
I'm sorry. You're just so sweaty.

01:11:48.690 --> 01:11:50.600
Mr. Weathers,

01:11:50.690 --> 01:11:52.740
there's a lot of really weird stuff
going on right now

01:11:52.770 --> 01:11:53.910
and I need your help.

01:11:54.010 --> 01:11:55.520
What do you need?

01:11:55.850 --> 01:11:57.560
I need trucks.

01:11:57.650 --> 01:11:59.040
Do you have any on your repo list?

01:12:05.530 --> 01:12:08.440
It's not our fault rich boy
can't make his payments.

01:12:14.530 --> 01:12:15.530
Yeah!

01:12:16.290 --> 01:12:17.290
Boom!

01:12:19.570 --> 01:12:21.720
Show me something! Come on!

01:12:21.970 --> 01:12:23.560
Yeah! Keep tagging him!

01:12:56.770 --> 01:12:57.820
I don't see anything on this

01:12:57.850 --> 01:12:59.940
that will carry that big sucker
I saw in the warehouse.

01:12:59.970 --> 01:13:02.200
What are you gonna need
to do to these trucks?

01:13:02.290 --> 01:13:03.290
Well,

01:13:04.090 --> 01:13:06.920
lift the engine, raise the suspension,

01:13:07.250 --> 01:13:09.920
cut up the body, customize the axles,

01:13:10.170 --> 01:13:12.920
and maximize the airflow.
All by morning. Twice.

01:13:13.170 --> 01:13:16.600
Maybe we'd get one done, but two?

01:13:16.690 --> 01:13:20.000
I don't have the tools or the parts
to get it done that quick.

01:13:22.210 --> 01:13:23.960
Do you know someone
with a repair shop?

01:13:24.290 --> 01:13:26.280
- Or...
- A dealership.

01:13:34.050 --> 01:13:38.520
You know, you're going to have to, like,
hang out with him and stuff after this.

01:13:38.650 --> 01:13:39.960
Maybe once.

01:13:40.290 --> 01:13:41.600
You'll be out by 7:00, right?

01:13:41.690 --> 01:13:44.120
The first workers get here at 7:00.

01:13:44.490 --> 01:13:45.710
Yeah.

01:13:45.810 --> 01:13:47.450
What's the best truck you got on the lot?

01:13:48.050 --> 01:13:50.720
Well, it's supposed to be
my 16th birthday present.

01:13:50.970 --> 01:13:52.640
No harm getting an early peek, right?

01:13:59.650 --> 01:14:00.770
Can you handle one of these?

01:14:01.490 --> 01:14:02.490
Uh, yeah.

01:14:10.330 --> 01:14:12.160
Be careful, it'll run away from you.

01:14:34.690 --> 01:14:35.750
Here you go. Drink up.

01:14:35.850 --> 01:14:37.840
We're going on a little road trip.

01:14:59.370 --> 01:15:01.090
Hey, man, you mind
helping me out with this?

01:15:01.130 --> 01:15:02.920
Yeah. Yeah, sure.

01:16:10.490 --> 01:16:11.960
Come on, man. Let's pick it up.

01:16:12.050 --> 01:16:13.960
Got to get those things
to the wastewater tank

01:16:14.050 --> 01:16:15.110
before they ship out.

01:16:18.690 --> 01:16:20.360
What's got into these things?

01:16:24.370 --> 01:16:25.370
Hey!

01:16:28.890 --> 01:16:31.000
Hey! Hey!

01:16:34.530 --> 01:16:36.360
Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.

01:16:36.530 --> 01:16:38.160
Yeah, get Burke on the phone.

01:16:38.530 --> 01:16:41.600
And start a trace on the box truck.
The big one.

01:16:45.690 --> 01:16:47.000
Dowd.

01:16:59.690 --> 01:17:01.340
Hey, I got them,
but there's not much time.

01:17:01.370 --> 01:17:03.880
Tenneson probably already
has Burke coming for us.

01:17:03.970 --> 01:17:05.800
Hey. Nice job.

01:17:06.010 --> 01:17:07.280
Thank you.

01:17:07.370 --> 01:17:10.040
I never drove a stick before.
It was very exciting.

01:17:10.250 --> 01:17:12.170
- Cool. Want to give me a hand with this?
- Yeah.

01:17:30.570 --> 01:17:31.570
Wow.

01:17:32.570 --> 01:17:33.840
Well, I'll be...

01:17:46.570 --> 01:17:47.920
Hey, there.

01:17:48.170 --> 01:17:49.280
You're looking good.

01:17:50.610 --> 01:17:51.920
For you.

01:17:59.450 --> 01:18:01.080
Okay. Okay.

01:18:03.090 --> 01:18:05.080
Yeah, I missed you.

01:18:05.610 --> 01:18:07.240
I missed you, too.

01:18:20.970 --> 01:18:22.440
They're a family.

01:18:24.970 --> 01:18:27.270
He was looking for his parents.

01:18:46.650 --> 01:18:48.950
I got the truck. It's stationary.

01:18:49.330 --> 01:18:52.160
Load up! Let's go! We got them!

01:19:09.850 --> 01:19:11.840
No turning back now.

01:19:15.770 --> 01:19:17.680
All right, this one's yours.

01:19:17.930 --> 01:19:19.320
Someone say I'm coming with you?

01:19:19.690 --> 01:19:21.520
Come on, man, we need you.

01:19:24.010 --> 01:19:25.150
Okay.

01:19:25.530 --> 01:19:29.000
If I'm going to go to prison,
it might as well be in style.

01:19:29.770 --> 01:19:31.810
Okay. The vents are marked on
this. I'll follow you.

01:19:33.250 --> 01:19:34.440
Yeah.

01:19:34.530 --> 01:19:36.260
You said these guys have
hive intelligence, right?

01:19:36.290 --> 01:19:37.290
Yeah.

01:19:37.370 --> 01:19:39.040
Well, then he'll know what to do.

01:19:39.130 --> 01:19:40.300
You're just there to guide him.

01:19:40.330 --> 01:19:42.160
- Right.
- Be gentle, but firm.

01:19:42.250 --> 01:19:43.250
That opens.

01:19:43.330 --> 01:19:44.500
Let him know you're the one steering.

01:19:44.530 --> 01:19:47.200
Right. Gentle but firm.
I'm the one steering.

01:19:47.850 --> 01:19:48.850
Uh... Okay.

01:19:53.050 --> 01:19:54.480
Hey.

01:19:57.730 --> 01:19:59.200
Go do this. Yeah.

01:19:59.970 --> 01:20:01.640
Thanks, Mr. Weathers.

01:20:09.250 --> 01:20:11.630
Hope you picked something up
from watching me.

01:20:20.890 --> 01:20:22.920
A week ago, you were riding a bicycle.

01:20:32.090 --> 01:20:34.080
Uh... Welcome to Geldon Dodge.

01:20:34.170 --> 01:20:36.120
Can we get you a cup
of complimentary coffee?

01:20:38.650 --> 01:20:39.650
They're on the move.

01:20:40.410 --> 01:20:41.410
What?

01:20:43.090 --> 01:20:44.310
What about the next slide?

01:20:45.250 --> 01:20:47.520
They're on the move in what?

01:21:02.130 --> 01:21:03.760
These guys were ready for a walk.

01:21:04.770 --> 01:21:06.480
They're happy they're going home.

01:21:12.130 --> 01:21:14.450
We just picked
them up on a police scanner.

01:21:14.530 --> 01:21:15.720
Off Old Cutler Road.

01:21:15.810 --> 01:21:17.360
It's close, about a mile south.

01:21:17.450 --> 01:21:19.640
There they are. Ten o'clock.

01:21:29.770 --> 01:21:30.770
Here we go.

01:21:30.970 --> 01:21:33.380
I can't believe I let you
and your girlfriend talk me into this.

01:21:33.410 --> 01:21:35.520
Uh, we're not... That's not, uh...

01:21:35.890 --> 01:21:37.030
Are we?

01:21:40.890 --> 01:21:43.040
Hey, Sheriff,
we got a call from Ken Galloway.

01:21:43.130 --> 01:21:45.000
Said a bunch of trucks
rode over his land.

01:21:45.090 --> 01:21:47.550
He said they looked like monster trucks.

01:21:47.650 --> 01:21:49.160
Yeah, which way were they headed?

01:21:55.490 --> 01:21:57.840
Okay, let's take out Big Green first.

01:21:58.010 --> 01:21:59.070
I'll take left.

01:21:59.170 --> 01:22:00.450
Roger that. Taking right.

01:22:03.810 --> 01:22:04.810
U h-oh.

01:22:10.930 --> 01:22:11.990
He needs help.

01:22:13.450 --> 01:22:15.400
Get behind him, Meredith.
Give him a push.

01:22:40.210 --> 01:22:41.350
Oh, what?

01:22:42.730 --> 01:22:44.530
Oh, I really hope
they had their seatbelts on.

01:22:51.250 --> 01:22:52.780
We can't outrun them in the flats.

01:22:52.810 --> 01:22:54.490
Just hang on.
We'll lose them in the rough.

01:23:04.010 --> 01:23:06.130
Stay close here, guys.
It's going to get tight.

01:23:06.210 --> 01:23:07.680
We'll get them on the ridge.

01:23:07.770 --> 01:23:08.930
Do we know where we're going?

01:23:09.130 --> 01:23:10.560
Don't worry, they know.

01:23:12.770 --> 01:23:14.500
Uh, downed tree, dead ahead!
Do we have a tree plan?

01:23:14.530 --> 01:23:17.200
Okay, guys. And pull!

01:23:25.450 --> 01:23:27.120
Okay, Dowd,
you can open your eyes now.

01:23:27.370 --> 01:23:29.280
Did we make it?

01:23:39.890 --> 01:23:42.160
Everybody, stay close.
It's going to get tight up here.

01:23:46.690 --> 01:23:48.050
They're right behind me!

01:23:50.730 --> 01:23:52.400
Tripp, on your right!

01:24:31.050 --> 01:24:34.120
All right, kid,
this is where your little joyride ends!

01:24:50.290 --> 01:24:51.290
Help!

01:24:56.010 --> 01:24:57.010
Tripp!

01:25:20.850 --> 01:25:22.070
Thanks, buddy!

01:25:44.970 --> 01:25:46.560
Tripp, are you okay?

01:25:46.650 --> 01:25:47.650
Yeah, yeah. I'm...

01:25:49.610 --> 01:25:50.610
What is that?

01:25:53.130 --> 01:25:54.440
Oh, Tenneson.

01:25:55.610 --> 01:25:57.880
It's poison! We gotta stop that tanker.

01:25:57.970 --> 01:25:58.980
They're going to poison the nest.

01:25:59.010 --> 01:26:00.480
Okay. We need to move faster.

01:26:02.530 --> 01:26:03.800
Oh, come on!

01:26:24.690 --> 01:26:26.000
Light it up.

01:26:35.810 --> 01:26:36.840
Get back! Stay back!

01:26:54.490 --> 01:26:55.840
We got 'em now!

01:26:56.770 --> 01:26:58.360
I see 'em! Go up the left side!

01:27:14.930 --> 01:27:16.200
Rick?

01:27:17.210 --> 01:27:18.840
Get to the sides! Get to the sides!

01:27:51.370 --> 01:27:54.010
I cannot believe you're here.
I'm actually really happy to see you.

01:27:54.450 --> 01:27:56.600
Hey, I told you I wasn't going anywhere.

01:27:56.690 --> 01:27:58.140
The vents are right on the other side.

01:27:58.170 --> 01:28:00.360
We have to get past this truck.
It's the only way.

01:28:00.610 --> 01:28:03.120
Hang, on, Tripp,
you're not seeing what I'm seeing.

01:28:03.370 --> 01:28:05.670
No, I got it right here.
I know what we're in for.

01:28:05.930 --> 01:28:08.100
I seriously hope you're not thinking
about jumping off a mountain.

01:28:08.130 --> 01:28:10.340
As the only scientist here,
I don't think they can do that.

01:28:10.370 --> 01:28:11.510
We don't have a choice.

01:28:11.810 --> 01:28:13.440
I hope you know
what you're doing, Tripp.

01:28:13.810 --> 01:28:15.960
Rick, give us something to jump.

01:28:16.650 --> 01:28:18.280
Yeah. Okay.

01:28:29.570 --> 01:28:31.720
Tripp, there's a 99% chance
that would be impossible.

01:28:32.050 --> 01:28:33.270
Maybe 100%.

01:28:35.330 --> 01:28:36.960
You be careful, son.

01:28:37.650 --> 01:28:39.970
Rick, I'm sorry I said all
those terrible things about you.

01:28:40.650 --> 01:28:41.650
Wait, what?

01:28:41.770 --> 01:28:42.770
Let's go!

01:28:50.890 --> 01:28:52.760
Come on, Creech!

01:29:27.570 --> 01:29:28.570
Go, Tripp!

01:29:28.850 --> 01:29:29.910
We made it!

01:29:35.250 --> 01:29:37.290
You guys take out the pumps,
I'll handle the tanker.

01:29:37.330 --> 01:29:38.840
- Got it.
- We're on it.

01:29:53.930 --> 01:29:55.760
Hey, there's another one.

01:29:57.210 --> 01:29:58.840
Pumps are at speed!

01:30:00.450 --> 01:30:02.120
We need to stop those pumps.

01:30:02.210 --> 01:30:03.920
Come on. One last push.
You're almost home.

01:30:12.530 --> 01:30:13.530
Whoa.

01:30:13.970 --> 01:30:15.970
Any trucks still running,
get up here to the vents.

01:30:34.490 --> 01:30:36.560
- Can we stop it?
- Ah. It locked me out.

01:30:36.730 --> 01:30:38.480
If this pressure gets to 15,000 psi,

01:30:38.570 --> 01:30:40.570
the poison will reach
all the way down to the nest.

01:30:50.170 --> 01:30:52.320
Come on, buddy, wake up! You can do it!

01:31:21.530 --> 01:31:22.530
The valves!

01:31:22.970 --> 01:31:24.160
Come on, come on!

01:31:24.810 --> 01:31:26.160
Righty-tighty.

01:31:26.810 --> 01:31:28.560
We have to stop the poison!

01:31:48.530 --> 01:31:50.800
It's not working! We're too late!

01:31:57.090 --> 01:31:59.440
Go! Get out! Save yourself!

01:32:32.170 --> 01:32:33.390
Tripp!

01:32:34.690 --> 01:32:35.720
We did it.

01:34:55.170 --> 01:34:57.000
I'm going to miss you, Creech.

01:35:01.170 --> 01:35:02.960
You were a good truck.

01:35:16.130 --> 01:35:19.000
Don't worry. I know where to find you.

01:35:56.330 --> 01:35:57.330
Tripp!

01:35:59.650 --> 01:36:00.650
Tripp!

01:36:01.690 --> 01:36:03.990
You stay put. We got you.

01:36:15.570 --> 01:36:18.080
Hi, Fish and Wildlife?

01:36:18.410 --> 01:36:20.640
Yeah, my friends and I found
some horned lizards

01:36:20.730 --> 01:36:22.720
on the Terravex property.

01:36:23.090 --> 01:36:25.550
Are they endangered, by any chance?

01:36:41.530 --> 01:36:43.680
Well, it's nothing like my old one,

01:36:43.770 --> 01:36:45.720
but I think it'll do.

01:36:45.890 --> 01:36:47.000
Yeah.

01:36:47.650 --> 01:36:49.920
Now you can do
whatever you want this summer.

01:36:52.250 --> 01:36:54.040
Take it as far as it'll go.

01:36:56.050 --> 01:36:57.520
Thanks, Rick.
