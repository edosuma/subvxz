Don't worry, Clover, I've got your back.

00:51.092 --> 00:52.594
Me too! Hi!

00:54.763 --> 00:57.307
Don't wanna die this way!

00:59.476 --> 01:05.106
Maurice! Where's King Julien?
Only he can save us.

01:09.027 --> 01:11.362
Sky Gods, keytar me!

01:27.337 --> 01:29.756
Julien!

01:29.839 --> 01:36.262
My double neck keytar is made from
purebred albino dragon incisors, Julien.

01:36.346 --> 01:40.099
Forged in the flames of Grogdomor.

01:40.183 --> 01:45.355
Once played by Patrick the Defiled One.
Surrender.

01:45.438 --> 01:46.898
Never!

02:12.423 --> 02:17.595
King Julien, wake up! King Julien.
King Julien, wake up! King Julien.

02:19.597 --> 02:21.850
Koto! Everyone behind me except Mort!

02:21.933 --> 02:23.643
He said my name.

02:24.811 --> 02:28.189
King Julien. It's okay.
You're safe. It was just a dream.

02:28.273 --> 02:33.111
A dream? But it was so real.
Koto kicked me out of my own kingdom.

02:33.194 --> 02:36.781
I ran away to an island where Crimson
tried to feed me to a tentacle

02:36.865 --> 02:40.201
that wrote poetry.
I pulled a heist with some sharks.

02:40.285 --> 02:43.746
I even wore a foosa costume
with Karl so I could stop Koto's wedding

02:43.830 --> 02:46.249
and get my kingdom back.

02:46.332 --> 02:52.839
And you were there, Clover.
And Maurice was there. And Mort.

02:52.922 --> 02:54.966
Oh, I'm still here, King Julien.

02:56.301 --> 02:59.596
Your Majesty, it wasn't a dream.
It all happened, and more.

02:59.679 --> 03:03.057
Wow. I really defeated
Koto with my keytar?

03:03.141 --> 03:05.351
Uh, sure. Yeah. Uh, why not?

03:07.812 --> 03:13.985
We really did a number on this place.
Maurice, what are all those goo puddles?

03:14.068 --> 03:17.614
Snail trails, Your Majesty.
They should dry up in a week or so.

03:17.697 --> 03:20.450
Snail trails?
Whose fault is that, Maurice?

03:20.533 --> 03:22.994
Your Mort horde ate
half our mango supplies!

03:23.077 --> 03:26.873
At least they didn't rub
their mucus on everything!

03:28.666 --> 03:32.670
Enough, you two. The important
thing is the kingdom is safe,

03:32.754 --> 03:34.505
and it'll be back to normal soon.

03:34.589 --> 03:40.386
No, Clover, the kingdom won't be back
to normal soon. Not if I can help it.

03:40.470 --> 03:41.679
King Julien, what are you--

03:41.763 --> 03:44.599
Silence, Mo-Mo.
I'm going to do some speechifying

03:44.682 --> 03:46.976
and I think there might be a point.

03:48.645 --> 03:51.397
Lemurs of Madagascar,
can I have your attention?

03:55.944 --> 04:00.031
In the past months,
we've experienced forced labor camps,

04:00.114 --> 04:04.786
monkeys in zeppelins,
tacky inter-species weddings and Willie.

04:04.869 --> 04:06.871
What the heck, man?

04:06.955 --> 04:09.123
Now, in the face of all this adversity,

04:09.207 --> 04:12.335
it would be pretty easy
to punch the negative card.

04:12.418 --> 04:17.006
To blame Maurice and just leave.
But I am asking you not to do this.

04:17.090 --> 04:19.175
-I don't want to leave.

04:19.259 --> 04:20.343
And where would we go?

04:20.426 --> 04:27.058
Don't be sad for us, be glad for us.
We've been given a gift, peoples.

04:27.141 --> 04:32.313
A chance to do it all again,
only this time we'll do it the right way.

04:32.397 --> 04:35.733
Yep! His mind is gone.
Horst, where are your bolos?

04:35.817 --> 04:37.026
Hold on, Hector,

04:37.110 --> 04:41.364
I think King J is trying to say
we're gonna learn from our mistakes?

04:41.447 --> 04:43.825
I mean, am I right

04:43.908 --> 04:47.495
No, Ted, this time I'm going
to be the one learning.

04:47.578 --> 04:52.792
Because from now on, I'm listening to
my peoples. Julien 2.0, y'all.

04:52.875 --> 04:57.171
I'm gonna do what you want.
Your voices, not mine,

04:57.255 --> 05:00.216
will be the most important in the kingdom.

05:03.303 --> 05:05.847
Well

05:05.930 --> 05:10.310
That nonsense actually might not
be a bad idea. I mean, Clover?

05:10.393 --> 05:11.227
I'm out of here.

05:11.311 --> 05:12.395
Where are you going?

05:12.478 --> 05:15.732
I promised Sage I'd help him look
for a new location for his kingdom.

05:15.815 --> 05:17.442
Since Koto burned his down.

05:17.525 --> 05:21.321
So, uh, you two are
house hunting together?

05:21.404 --> 05:24.115
Yeah. No! I mean... It's, ooh, it's ju...

05:24.198 --> 05:27.660
Oh. Clover's got a boy--

05:28.494 --> 05:33.207
No. Sage and I are colleagues.
Uh, nothing else. But for the record.

05:33.583 --> 05:37.128
The people are idiots, Your Majesty.
Incapable of governing themselves.

05:37.211 --> 05:39.005
This will end in disaster.

05:39.088 --> 05:41.549
So you think my idea is genius?

05:42.967 --> 05:44.093
See you in a week.

05:44.594 --> 05:45.970
I'm okay.

05:51.601 --> 05:53.436
Hello, Mort!

05:53.519 --> 05:58.107
Zora, please, I'm working.
King Julien is desperate

05:58.191 --> 06:00.735
for my ideas for Julien 2.0.

06:00.818 --> 06:05.823
Oh, sorry, my love. May I see?

06:05.907 --> 06:10.995
Ooh! What is "toenail garden"?

06:11.079 --> 06:14.332
It's very technical,
you wouldn't understand!

06:14.415 --> 06:21.297
Ooh, you so wise, Mort.
Our family will be full of genius.

06:21.380 --> 06:27.637
Family? Um, full disclosure,
I haven't laid an egg in, like, 40 years,

06:27.720 --> 06:30.681
and even then the thing that
I hatched was really gross.

06:30.765 --> 06:36.687
Oh! You have unleashed
real woman in Zora, Mort.

06:36.771 --> 06:41.109
Oh, no turning back. Mm...

06:42.193 --> 06:46.656
I have before me all of
your anonymous suggestions

06:46.739 --> 06:48.991
as to how to remake our kingdom.

06:49.075 --> 06:53.704
Don't forget mine! Read my ideas first,
Your Majesty. Mine first!

06:53.788 --> 06:57.792
What part of anonymous don't you
understand, you little skin tag!

07:00.211 --> 07:01.796
Now, let's see what we have.

07:02.755 --> 07:04.090
Eh...

07:04.173 --> 07:07.343
"People should shut up and leave me alone.

07:07.426 --> 07:10.096
You got a problem with that?"
Signed Hector.

07:10.179 --> 07:13.850
Okay, again, not anonymous,
but good start. Good start.

07:13.933 --> 07:17.270
Here's one, uh,
"Hey, King Julien, this is Pancho."

07:17.353 --> 07:20.314
Does no one understand
the anonymous thing?

07:20.398 --> 07:22.650
"Establish a drama academy..."

07:22.733 --> 07:25.903
Here we go.
"...that will encourage young show boys

07:25.987 --> 07:28.823
to never give up on their
mother's dream of stardom."

07:28.906 --> 07:33.035
Oh, that one's good. Who wrote that?
Got my vote right there.

07:33.744 --> 07:36.414
Maybe there's some better
ones toward the bottom.

07:41.419 --> 07:44.630
Stop being such a baby.
How would you like talons

07:44.714 --> 07:46.924
tearing up your back
every time we spooned?

07:47.800 --> 07:52.054
'Ello, 'ello, 'ello, Your Majesty.
All set to go kingdom hunting?

07:52.138 --> 07:54.223
I've got some great ideas!

07:54.307 --> 07:57.977
Oh, ah, uh, thanks, Clover,
but I already hired a real estate agent.

07:58.060 --> 08:01.189
Wait, what?
But I... Where did you fi... uh...

08:02.398 --> 08:07.570
Hello, Miss Clover. Hope you, uh,
don't mind me lending lendin' a hand?

08:07.653 --> 08:10.823
Captain

08:10.907 --> 08:15.119
Just got my certification.
Figured I've plundered enough kingdoms

08:15.203 --> 08:16.287
to know what's good.

08:16.370 --> 08:20.166
He says with all the recent carnage
and destruction, it's a buyers' market.

08:20.917 --> 08:22.168
Right.

08:22.251 --> 08:25.505
So are, uh, you two looking
for something together,

08:25.588 --> 08:28.174
or is this more of a bachelor kingdom--

08:29.592 --> 08:32.553
I am just helping out a friend, got it?

08:32.637 --> 08:33.513

Look around you, Maurice. This is
the kingdom I've always dreamed of.

09:56.178 --> 09:59.307
We just needed to be conquered
and enslaved to find it.

09:59.390 --> 10:02.935
Oh, King Julien!
Check out our artists collective.

10:03.019 --> 10:05.229
No one is allowed to judge the art.

10:05.313 --> 10:08.566
All they can do is look at
it and not have an opinion.

10:08.649 --> 10:11.444
Nice one, Ted. Livin' the dream.

10:11.527 --> 10:15.323
Looky here, King Julien,
no conflict in this dance class.

10:15.406 --> 10:18.534
Everyone gets a trophy, not just my Todd.

10:19.243 --> 10:24.457
You're all winners, right, children?
I said you're all winners! Say it!

10:24.540 --> 10:27.001
We're all winners.

10:27.084 --> 10:31.213
You are an inspiration, Tammy.
Keep up the good work.

10:32.256 --> 10:35.885
Well, hello, Mr. King Julien,
care to scrub in?

10:35.968 --> 10:40.890
We're performing surgeries that
society once judged too kill-y.

10:41.557 --> 10:44.560
No judgment anymore, thanks to you.

10:47.563 --> 10:50.149
Appreciate the offer,
Doctor S, but I just ate.

10:50.232 --> 10:53.903
No problem.
We're gonna be here for a while.

10:53.986 --> 10:56.906
Nurse Phantom, start the saw!

11:01.869 --> 11:06.624
Ah! Smell that, Maurice?
No conflict even makes the air better.

11:06.707 --> 11:09.877
Actually, I think it's the new
toilet cakes in the outhouses.

11:09.960 --> 11:11.754
What was that?

11:11.837 --> 11:13.255
Take that back!

11:13.339 --> 11:18.135
Who dares bring conflict into my kingdom?
They will pay! Pay!

11:19.220 --> 11:21.430
Pancho What's going on?

11:21.514 --> 11:22.348
Ask Horst.

11:22.431 --> 11:27.061
Yeah, he wanted a sip from
my beverage and I said no.

11:27.144 --> 11:29.605
He called me a felon.

11:29.688 --> 11:30.731
But you are a felon.

11:30.815 --> 11:31.941
Oh, really? Everyone knows that.

11:33.234 --> 11:34.235
Everyone?

11:34.318 --> 11:39.281
I now pronounce you lemur and lemuss.
You may place the rings on your fingers.

11:40.282 --> 11:41.575
-Felon!
-Aw, sheesh!

11:45.162 --> 11:47.081
-Aw, sheesh!

11:47.915 --> 11:50.918
Hey, felon,
what you doing with my delicates?

11:51.001 --> 11:52.336
Aw, sheesh!

11:53.087 --> 11:57.800
Okay, so maybe everybody does know,
but that word still hurts!

11:57.883 --> 12:02.972
I thought the kingdom was supposed
to be a safe place now?

12:05.474 --> 12:10.604
Pancho is right. Sometimes words
can be just as hurtful as a spear,

12:10.688 --> 12:14.316
or fire, or a parasite that
liquefies your insides.

12:14.400 --> 12:16.610
Maurice, poll the kingdom.

12:16.694 --> 12:19.864
Let's see if anymore
hurtful words have gotten through.

12:19.947 --> 12:23.534
-According to the kingdom, yes.

12:24.118 --> 12:26.704
Cantaloupe

12:26.787 --> 12:28.664
Hector had a bad experience.

12:29.206 --> 12:34.003
Why are you here?
What do you want from me?

12:34.545 --> 12:36.797
King Julien,
I'm all for a conflict-free kingdom,

12:36.881 --> 12:40.134
but how are we supposed to monitor
people from saying all these words?

12:40.217 --> 12:45.681
Lemurs of Madagascar,
concern over certain hurtful words

12:45.764 --> 12:47.600
has come to my attention.

12:47.683 --> 12:51.145
But never fear, your sensitive
and understanding King

12:51.228 --> 12:56.108
has found a solution.
I give to you, the victim horn!

12:56.192 --> 12:58.402
What are we gonna do with that?

12:58.486 --> 13:02.448
I need a volunteer to read
from a prepared script.

13:02.531 --> 13:07.745
Me! Me! Oh, please let it be me!
You don't know how much I need this!

13:07.828 --> 13:11.040
Oh. Not much of a part.
How long do I have to prepare?

13:11.123 --> 13:12.458
Just read the script, Ted!

13:14.043 --> 13:19.715
"Hey, Maurice, did you swallow a melon
or is your tummy really that--"

13:19.798 --> 13:21.008
-Ow!

13:21.091 --> 13:22.051
Hoo-hoo!

13:22.218 --> 13:26.514
Did you see that?
Whenever someone utters a hurtful word...

13:27.598 --> 13:31.519
you just blast the word away
with your victim horn and sha-booya!

13:31.602 --> 13:36.023
The word never existed.
Who wants to do some horning?

13:41.654 --> 13:45.866
A kingdom full of horn-blasting lemurs.
Oh, yeah, this isn't gonna be a disaster.

13:49.119 --> 13:53.290
I hope the water is warmer than yesterday.
I nearly froze my

13:53.624 --> 13:56.335
You thought I was gonna say--

13:58.170 --> 13:59.588
You did it again!

13:59.672 --> 14:02.341
You mean you weren't going to say--

14:02.424 --> 14:05.261
No, you moron, I was gonna say--

14:09.223 --> 14:10.432
Good night, Dorothy.

14:10.516 --> 14:13.394
Good night, Ted. I love--

14:13.477 --> 14:16.981
So I said to Becca, "You know what that's
called a tossed salad."

14:17.064 --> 14:18.649
Which meant I had to get the dressing.

14:18.732 --> 14:20.276
And that's when I realized...

14:20.359 --> 14:22.653
I didn't have any dressing.

14:22.736 --> 14:25.656
But that didn't make sense. Crazy, huh?

14:25.865 --> 14:27.032
Uh-huh.

14:27.116 --> 14:32.538
And that's why we now have proof
that life began because of a big--

14:33.831 --> 14:36.000
I'm sorry, did I say a hurt word?

14:37.167 --> 14:38.294
Because I'm pretty sure--

14:38.377 --> 14:40.421
We weren't questioning your words.

14:40.504 --> 14:42.840
We were questioning your syntax.

14:43.340 --> 14:46.719
Your word sentences
is causing us distress!

14:46.802 --> 14:50.139
Yeah!
Stop treading on us with your knowledge!

14:51.974 --> 14:54.602
Do you hear that, Maurice?

14:54.685 --> 14:57.605
That's the sound
of no conflict right there.

14:57.688 --> 14:58.647
That's what that is.

14:58.731 --> 15:02.568
If you think that's the sound
of no conflict, you crazy!

15:05.863 --> 15:09.533
Now this first kingdom
is a bit of a fixer-upper.

15:09.617 --> 15:12.995
What are you talking about?
This is perfect!

15:14.330 --> 15:15.956
It's a lifeless desert, Sage.

15:16.040 --> 15:19.543
I know. We should move on this
before someone else makes a bid.

15:21.921 --> 15:23.047
What else you got?

15:25.174 --> 15:28.177
Whoa! A tree fort. Cool.

15:29.094 --> 15:30.804
Hello, neighbors.

15:34.308 --> 15:35.142
Next!

15:35.976 --> 15:40.230
This one just came on the market.
It's a subterranean lair, air cooled

15:40.314 --> 15:44.818
and heated by a lava flow in the rec room.
Uh, now let me just, uh, get the key.

15:48.322 --> 15:52.660
Very sorry, Your Majesty. I was assured
the old tenants had moved out.

15:52.743 --> 15:54.995
Welcome back, folks.

15:55.079 --> 15:57.247
In our next segment, I--

15:57.331 --> 16:01.794
I ask everyone to remove their
hats and shout, "Look at my head!"

16:03.754 --> 16:05.297
So I said

16:05.714 --> 16:08.509
Ah, what's the use? Cut to commercial!

16:08.592 --> 16:12.638
Hey, kids, are there times your
victim horn just isn't enough?

16:12.721 --> 16:16.976
Or maybe after being horned all day,
you just need a stress free break.

16:17.059 --> 16:21.689
Well, then you need a Fairfax-branded,
Emotional Support Mort.

16:21.772 --> 16:24.441
Hi! Wanna rub my belly?

16:24.525 --> 16:28.445
Go ahead, do it. The first rub is free.

16:28.529 --> 16:31.949
That's how confident we are that
you'll feel better in no time.

16:32.032 --> 16:35.869
I sure do. Rub your Mort today.

16:35.953 --> 16:38.163
That second rub's gonna cost you.

16:39.790 --> 16:41.291
No, it's not! You are--

16:41.375 --> 16:45.754
My rights are being stepped on here.
This is injustice. I'm really angry.

16:45.838 --> 16:47.548
You need to put a stop to this,
Your Majesty.

16:48.924 --> 16:53.721
I know I can make a better kingdom.
I just need more time. Uh, just a skosh!

16:53.804 --> 16:56.306
-King Julien.
-Bing! Your bing, bing!

16:56.390 --> 16:58.642
Lemurs of

16:58.726 --> 17:02.688
Stop it! I didn't even say anything!
I'm just... moving my lips!

17:03.564 --> 17:09.528
Uh, I'd like to start by saying
Maurice owes you an apology.

17:09.611 --> 17:15.451
You were supposed to protect us.
I'm traumatized here! I'm traumatized!

17:15.534 --> 17:21.081
I know. I forgot that after being horned,
my people would need a place to chill out.

17:21.165 --> 17:27.337
To get calm. Therefore,
I propose we create a No Conflict Zone.

17:27.421 --> 17:33.802
A nourishing womb that you can all crawl
into when things get just too horned.

17:33.886 --> 17:38.599
Where are we gonna find a womb that big?
We're all gonna die!

17:39.475 --> 17:45.439
Don't worry, I'm sure we can find
a womb big enough for all of you.

17:45.522 --> 17:47.066
I'm open to suggestions.

17:49.943 --> 17:55.657
Aw, you have got to be kidding me!
I've been kicked off my throne, again!

17:55.741 --> 17:58.535
Crystal clear salt water pool, eh?

17:58.619 --> 18:01.163
There's more dead things in
that pool than salt water.

18:01.246 --> 18:05.417
Clover's right. There's no way I could
put my Inflatable Pegasus Lounger

18:05.501 --> 18:09.838
or Floating Fiesta Island with
Dual Drink Cozies in there. Bummer.

18:09.922 --> 18:12.633
Well, I'm afraid that's everything,
Your Majesty.

18:12.716 --> 18:17.513
All the other kingdoms are still occupied.
We could, of course, uh, plunder.

18:17.596 --> 18:22.059
No. That was Koto's way. The chef
who steals the recipe of the thief

18:22.142 --> 18:25.562
will find his meal unfulfilling.
And he'll probably get the squirts.

18:25.646 --> 18:29.024
I, uh, believe they call it
the Madagascar shuffle.

18:29.108 --> 18:30.567
Right, shuffle.

18:30.651 --> 18:35.322
Hold on, what about the Mountain
Lemur's ancestral kingdom, eh

18:35.405 --> 18:37.616
Didn't you tell me it was the most
beautiful place you'd ever seen?

18:37.699 --> 18:41.620
Yes. My ancestral home
exudes a beauty so profound

18:41.703 --> 18:46.083
it can only be expressed in the grunts
and spasms of something yet unborn.

18:46.166 --> 18:50.921
Sadly, it has been abandoned for decades
and how could I be so stupid?

18:51.004 --> 18:55.425
We should just move back
into our old ancestral home.

18:55.509 --> 18:59.596
You truly are the worst
real estate broker ever.

18:59.680 --> 19:05.060
Such stupidity can be forgiven,
but not the waste of your precious time!

19:05.144 --> 19:07.604
Sage, I'm sure the Captain did
his best. There's no need to--

19:07.688 --> 19:09.481
I brought you an extra flogging stick.

19:09.565 --> 19:11.984
-Much thanks, my king.

19:15.904 --> 19:21.451
Xixi here, reporting live from the womb.
Uh, not a lot happening. It's kinda warm.

19:21.535 --> 19:26.331
Now how long do we... stay in here?

19:26.415 --> 19:32.171
You can't put no time limit on emotional
wounds. Those scars never heal!

19:32.254 --> 19:35.299
Zora

19:35.382 --> 19:41.555
Yes, Mort. When we go back to
stump to talk about family?

19:43.348 --> 19:46.393
Speaking of mistakes, where's Todd?

19:46.476 --> 19:49.062
My baby gets aggressive in tight spaces.

19:49.146 --> 19:52.274
Hey, something just grabbed my leg!

19:52.357 --> 19:54.902
-Todd!

19:54.985 --> 19:59.448
-Todd!
-We are doomed!

20:00.657 --> 20:03.327
I'm a two-time loser, Maurice.

20:03.410 --> 20:06.622
No disrespect, but you've lost
a few more times than that.

20:06.705 --> 20:09.208
What am I gonna do now? Wander the jungle,

20:09.291 --> 20:13.086
trying to sell myself as a trained
booty shaker who used to be a king?

20:13.170 --> 20:15.505
Nobody wants failure
twerking in front of them.

20:15.589 --> 20:21.470
All I wanted was to give my people peace
and kindness but all they wanted was-- That's it! Maurice, I know how
to fix this! All I have to do--

20:29.353 --> 20:32.481
King Julien, no! No!

20:32.814 --> 20:37.694
You can't take him now! Why, Frank

20:42.908 --> 20:47.663
That is it!
I am through with this kingdom!

20:47.746 --> 20:52.584
I'm starting my own sovereign nation
where the only voice I hear is--

20:52.668 --> 20:56.546
No! King Julien!

20:57.256 --> 21:03.053
Maurice, what did you do?
You were always jealous of him!

21:03.136 --> 21:06.932
I didn't do anything! It was the kingdom!
It was just too much for him.

21:07.015 --> 21:09.977
All he wanted was to do what
was best for his people.

21:10.060 --> 21:14.314
To give us the kingdom we'd always
dreamed of. To hear our voices.

21:14.982 --> 21:21.405
But instead, all anyone cared about was
having the loudest voice to complain.

21:21.488 --> 21:26.076
Who would want a kingdom of complainers?
Well, except maybe Hector.

21:26.159 --> 21:27.661
Not apologizing.

21:27.744 --> 21:32.082
We shouldn't be afraid of words or ideas.
Everyone gets hurt feelings

21:32.165 --> 21:35.085
and that's a good thing.
It means we're individuals.

21:35.168 --> 21:39.840
And that's how we make a great kingdom.
By learning from each other.

21:39.923 --> 21:43.385
And we should do it... for King Julien.

21:43.468 --> 21:46.346
It should have been me!

21:46.430 --> 21:50.767
Oh, Maurice, we must honor the King Julien

21:50.851 --> 21:54.229
by creating kingdom he proud of, no?

21:54.313 --> 21:59.860
The freak is right. We... owe him that.

21:59.943 --> 22:03.113
We begin today. Come, Mort.

22:03.196 --> 22:05.574
You know, I'm gonna hang back and--

22:07.492 --> 22:11.872
You may have been stubborn and wildly
inappropriate, King Julien...

22:12.414 --> 22:13.415
But you're still--

22:15.334 --> 22:21.048
Of course, Mo-Mo. That was what I figured
out. What do all good kingdoms have?

22:21.131 --> 22:24.676
Huh A martyr to unify them.

22:25.844 --> 22:29.973
Sometimes you just gotta go big.
And you totally sold it, Mo-Mo.

22:30.057 --> 22:33.560
I was grieving! What happens
when they find out you're alive?

22:33.643 --> 22:36.521
Ha! Please, in a few weeks
they'll have forgotten

22:36.605 --> 22:40.275
any of this even happened.
