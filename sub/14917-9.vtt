WEBVTT

00:03.700 --> 00:07.689
This is the center's kitchen.

00:09.280 --> 00:11.390
- Yeah, annot in a good way.
- No.

00:11.400 --> 00:15.010
Hey, uh, ma, you know,
this tile's kinda grotty.

00:15.020 --> 00:16.329
You're just noticing the tiles?

00:16.350 --> 00:20.040
That's easy to fix. I've got some great
books on restoration and renovation.

00:20.050 --> 00:22.010
You all can help me pick a look.

00:22.030 --> 00:24.140
- Come on.
- YaY.

00:24.150 --> 00:29.060
This will be the heart and soul
of the center--the great room.

00:29.070 --> 00:31.070
If this is the great room,
I'd hate to see the good room.

00:31.080 --> 00:33.480
You know, you keep calling it "the
center." It sounds like a cult.

00:33.490 --> 00:35.490
You need to come up with, like,
a proper name for this place.

00:35.500 --> 00:37.460
yeah, nora, and make sure
it's not cancer house.

00:37.470 --> 00:38.550
How about ach motel?

00:38.560 --> 00:39.980
All right, y guys. Everyone, stop.

00:39.990 --> 00:41.810
You just need to have a little vision.

00:41.820 --> 00:42.900
Go with me on this.

00:42.910 --> 00:47.430
Okay, now we'll put a tv and
some nice chairs over there,

00:47.440 --> 00:49.490
and then over there in
that corner will be, like,

00:49.500 --> 00:52.320
a rec room with a ping-pong
table and video games.

00:52.330 --> 00:54.610
Mom, what's with all the power tools?

00:54.620 --> 00:55.710
Uh, yes.

00:55.720 --> 00:59.930
I-I met with a contractor who had
the audacity to quote me $60,000

00:59.940 --> 01:02.760
- for interior demolition alone.
- ouch.

01:02.770 --> 01:05.489
Yeah, so I thought maybe
we could do it ourselves.

01:05.500 --> 01:06.150
Excuse me?

01:06.170 --> 01:08.320
"We" as in we here in this room?

01:08.330 --> 01:11.030
Oh, sarah and kitty will be joining
us later, and that'll be great.

01:11.040 --> 01:13.630
Tommy's out of town. It's really
not that big a deal. Honestly.

01:13.640 --> 01:17.870
I mean, we just need to, you know,
knock out these two little wall things

01:17.890 --> 01:20.060
and some stuff back
there, air it all out.

01:20.070 --> 01:22.040
It's really just some basic demolition.

01:22.070 --> 01:26.460
No, basic demolition is what we do to each other
at dinner after we've had copious amounts of wine.

01:26.470 --> 01:28.070
You can't mix that with power tools.

01:28.080 --> 01:29.790
Plus, you know what? It's our day off.

01:29.800 --> 01:32.630
And I don't know if you're familiar
with the term. It actually means no work.

01:32.640 --> 01:36.440
No. Work? No, no. Oh,
this will be so much fun.

01:36.450 --> 01:38.860
Do you know how many
calories you're gonna burn?

01:38.870 --> 01:40.810
You know what? I think I'd
rather take a spin class.

01:40.820 --> 01:43.880
Nora, you said "tour." You
said "architectural tour."

01:43.890 --> 01:47.080
I said it would include a tour.

01:47.110 --> 01:51.220
Oh, saul, you and william
built ojai from nothing.

01:51.230 --> 01:52.900
Why can't we do that here?

01:52.920 --> 01:57.330
Build another family legacy, something
that will live on way past us,

01:57.350 --> 02:00.210
something that doesn't include holly.

02:02.020 --> 02:04.820
I've never... done
anything like this before.

02:04.830 --> 02:06.870
I've never believed in
anything so strongly.

02:06.880 --> 02:09.380
This is my ojai.

02:14.890 --> 02:17.650
Ma, you realize that ojai
wasn't built in a day, though?

02:17.660 --> 02:19.270
Yeah, and you can't
just knock down a wall.

02:19.300 --> 02:21.090
You have to consider
electrical, plumbing.

02:21.110 --> 02:25.620
Oh, I have cons-- I have walked through
this entire house with the contractor

02:25.630 --> 02:29.000
taking copious notes--bearing
walls, electrical, plumbing.

02:29.020 --> 02:31.970
I've put it all down
here on the floor plan.

02:31.990 --> 02:33.440
It's all marked.

02:33.460 --> 02:35.530
It is...

02:35.540 --> 02:38.140
guys, this isn't brain surgery.

02:38.170 --> 02:41.310
So we believe this
campaign captures the brand.

02:41.320 --> 02:44.900
We'll launch with a mix of spread
print, web banners and direct mail.

02:44.910 --> 02:47.180
That's great, chris. Thank you.

02:50.760 --> 02:53.440
Go ahead. Say what you think.

02:57.880 --> 02:59.590
well, I think it's a great campaign.

02:59.620 --> 03:02.590
I-I just--I'm not
sure if it speaks to...

03:02.610 --> 03:05.290
people like me.

03:05.300 --> 03:10.210
I guess it just feels like it's more directed
toward people who already know a lot about wine.

03:10.230 --> 03:11.560
She means old people.

03:11.570 --> 03:13.540
No, no. Uh, uh, sophisticated.

03:13.550 --> 03:14.890
Oh, nice save.

03:14.900 --> 03:18.950
The fact that four women can share an
awesome bottle of our petite syrah for,

03:18.970 --> 03:22.910
what, $12, when you can't even
get a cosmo for that at--at skybar?

03:22.940 --> 03:25.060
I mean, we should capitalize
on that, sell it as, you know,

03:25.090 --> 03:28.510
a girls'-night-out wine,
a girls'-night-in wine.

03:31.430 --> 03:36.110
but, you know, I also know that, you know, tommy's
a little bit more into the higher end customer.

03:36.120 --> 03:38.540
No, tommy's not here.

03:38.580 --> 03:41.300
- It's not a bad idea, rebeccA.
- not at all.

03:41.310 --> 03:45.850
You know, we always need trendwatchers,
if you're ever looking for a part-time job.

03:45.870 --> 03:46.970
- Really?
- Well, yeah.

03:46.980 --> 03:49.540
- I mean, if it's all right with my client.
- By all means.

03:49.550 --> 03:52.600
- Send us a rÃ©sum?
- I will.

03:58.190 --> 03:59.230
where are you?

03:59.260 --> 04:00.430
I'm at home. Where are you?

04:00.440 --> 04:02.420
Oh, sarah. Sorry.

04:02.430 --> 04:05.550
I thought you were my very
demanding and very late husband.

04:05.580 --> 04:06.880
Okay, kitty, I need a pep talk.

04:06.890 --> 04:09.400
Tell me I'm a brilliant businesswoman
and I know what I'm doing.

04:09.410 --> 04:10.980
I don't even know why
I'm talking to you.

04:10.990 --> 04:13.280
You hated the whole
greenatopia proposal.

04:13.290 --> 04:15.190
I was in a very bad place.

04:15.210 --> 04:17.850
It's a good idea, right?
You'd use greenatopia.

04:17.860 --> 04:19.290
Mom would use greenatopia.

04:19.310 --> 04:20.730
Why are you so out of breath?

04:20.769 --> 04:23.420
I'm scrubbing my conference room,
otherwise known as my kitchen.

04:23.430 --> 04:25.160
We've got a meeting with
a potential investor.

04:25.170 --> 04:29.420
Oh, my god. There are corn
flakes ground into my floor.

04:29.910 --> 04:34.100
Honestly, kitty, who is gonna lk into
my living room and take us seriously?

04:34.120 --> 04:36.100
All right, sarah, just listen to me.

04:36.130 --> 04:40.220
You are brilliant, you are experienced,
and you have a very good idea.

04:40.230 --> 04:41.900
Just stay calm.

04:41.920 --> 04:43.370
Stay calm. I know that.

04:43.380 --> 04:45.280
Hey, have you seen my notes? I
had them in my hand a minute ago.

04:45.290 --> 04:46.800
Dining room table,
second chair on the left.

04:46.820 --> 04:48.560
Okay, kitty, I gotta go.

04:48.570 --> 04:50.480
oh, gee. Nice talking to you, too.

04:50.490 --> 04:52.160
where'd you get that tie?

04:52.170 --> 04:52.840
Thrift store.

04:52.850 --> 04:54.250
Looks like it. Lose it.

04:54.260 --> 04:55.730
I still think we should've
rented conference room.

04:55.740 --> 04:56.830
Maybe we should just reschedule this.

04:56.840 --> 04:58.490
Kyle, danny brown is
gonna be here any minute.

04:58.510 --> 04:59.710
We can't afford a conference room.

04:59.720 --> 05:00.870
We can barely afford lunch.

05:00.880 --> 05:03.720
Besides, venture capital
firms love frugality.

05:03.740 --> 05:05.960
It shows them that we're only
spending on what's critical,

05:05.990 --> 05:07.630
therefore maximizing
potential profitability.

05:07.640 --> 05:09.880
And it's a pretty good
story for the business press.

05:09.910 --> 05:11.510
That's right. I keep forgettg
you're the one with the M.B.A.

05:11.520 --> 05:12.080
Don't forget it.

05:12.100 --> 05:13.150
Do you really think he's gonna invest?

05:13.160 --> 05:16.180
I mean, we sent out 128
proposals and only got one hit.

05:16.190 --> 05:17.320
One very big hit.

05:17.330 --> 05:20.310
Phoenix is one of the biggest
venture capital firms in california.

05:20.320 --> 05:22.810
Right, but just to clarify, if
these guys decide not to invest,

05:22.830 --> 05:24.680
we have no backup plan, we're done.

05:24.700 --> 05:26.760
Okay, stop it with the
negativity, both of you.

05:26.790 --> 05:29.500
You have to be confident.
Business is like dating.

05:29.510 --> 05:30.990
Oh, no.

05:31.010 --> 05:34.390
Greenatopia has the potential
to be incredibly lucrative.

05:34.400 --> 05:36.290
- I know that. You know that.
- I do.

05:36.300 --> 05:39.960
Our job is to let him know
that, and the key is to be calm.

05:39.980 --> 05:42.130
I'm calm.

05:42.140 --> 05:43.590
Stay calm.

05:43.610 --> 05:45.670
Do you want me
to-- I should--okay.

05:45.680 --> 05:46.970
- ready?
- Yeah.

05:46.980 --> 05:48.660
hey, what's up?

05:48.670 --> 05:50.940
- Hey, good. How you doing?
- How are you?

05:50.950 --> 05:53.010
- I'm well.
- Welcome. Thank you for coming.

05:53.020 --> 05:53.560
My pleasure.

05:53.570 --> 05:55.580
Sorry we have to meet here
instead of a conference room.

05:55.590 --> 05:58.330
That's because we're frugal,
and we love frugality.

05:58.350 --> 06:01.100
Uh, no, no, no, no, no.
This is--this is not, um...

06:01.110 --> 06:04.420
graham. Hi, um, at are you doing here?

06:04.430 --> 06:09.870
Uh, well, my colleague danny brown
couldn't make it, so, uh, here I am.

06:09.880 --> 06:10.980
You're with phoenix now?

06:11.000 --> 06:13.990
Yeah, I've been with them
for the last six months.

06:14.680 --> 06:16.560
G--oh, great.
That's great.

06:16.570 --> 06:17.940
- You look good.
- You, too.

06:17.950 --> 06:20.860
I'm sorry. Uh, so you guys...
you--you know each other?

06:20.870 --> 06:22.800
Uh, yes, yes. This is graham finch.

06:22.810 --> 06:26.140
We worked together briefly.
Ethan travis, kyle dewitt.

06:26.150 --> 06:27.480
- Nice to meet you.
- Kyle.

06:27.490 --> 06:30.040
Um, I shook your hand
already. I don't know why...

06:32.160 --> 06:34.110
so who'd like a coffee?

06:34.480 --> 06:36.990

06:44.000 --> 06:44.970
Sorry I'm late.

06:44.980 --> 06:46.540
I've been waiting for you for an hour.

06:46.550 --> 06:47.840
I know. I got held up.

06:47.850 --> 06:49.550
- Listen, there's something I want to talk to you about.
- Okay.

06:49.560 --> 06:51.670
You remember mike in
the washington office?

06:51.680 --> 06:54.580
Mike. Um, oh, yeah.
Mike with the big teeth?

06:54.590 --> 06:59.250
Well, two months ago, they had
these beautiful, amazing twins.

06:59.260 --> 07:03.050
So I brought you the information
on the service they used.

07:04.230 --> 07:05.840
Surrogacy.

07:05.860 --> 07:06.790
What do you think?

07:06.820 --> 07:11.770
I guess I've just really fallen in love with the
idea of giving a child who's already here a home.

07:11.800 --> 07:13.730
I know. Me, too, but what we've
been through with adoption?

07:13.740 --> 07:15.990
Getting our hopes up and
having trish change her mind?

07:16.020 --> 07:17.520
I-I don't want to go
through that again.

07:17.540 --> 07:18.550
Well, neither do I.

07:18.570 --> 07:21.910
With surrogacy, it's not even an issue.
The child is ours, no questions asked.

07:21.920 --> 07:24.330
It is clean, it is easy. We
are completely in control.

07:24.340 --> 07:26.890
Look, honey, it's not like I haven't
considered going down this route--

07:26.900 --> 07:32.330
I just thought instead of waiting for somebody in
the ether to choose us and then maybe backing out,

07:32.370 --> 07:34.310
- you know, it's something we should think about.
- All right.

07:34.320 --> 07:35.890
- All right. I'll think about it.
- Good.

07:35.900 --> 07:38.440
Yeah. Oh, hey. Thanks
for getting back to me.

07:38.450 --> 07:41.730
We're talking about an eco-friendly
company with an exciting revenue model.

07:41.760 --> 07:44.400
You input your zip code, the
product you want and voil?

07:44.420 --> 07:46.080
we give you all your local options.

07:46.090 --> 07:48.290
Customer base is there.
Everybody's dying to buy local.

07:48.300 --> 07:52.150
that's fine, but we're not talking
about funding a lemonade stand, okay?

07:52.160 --> 07:55.300
See, in order for me to recommend
that phoenix invest in your company,

07:55.330 --> 07:59.380
I've got to know that there will be
a minimum of a million views a month.

07:59.410 --> 08:01.010
Try a million a week.

08:01.020 --> 08:02.750
And you know this, uh, how?

08:02.760 --> 08:04.590
Well, we've crunched some rough numbers.

08:04.620 --> 08:08.640
Right, and, uh, and now exactly,
uh, uh, how, uh, did you crunch,

08:08.650 --> 08:10.390
and what numbers specifically?

08:10.410 --> 08:13.770
What was the crunchulation
factor in your crunchification?

08:13.780 --> 08:14.690
It's all in there, appendix "B."

08:14.710 --> 08:18.030
Let's not get bogged down in
the testing methodology, graham.

08:18.050 --> 08:21.160
The starting demographics of a
site like greenatopia are users with

08:21.180 --> 08:25.440
- an income average of between $150,000 and $200,000 a year.
- right.

08:25.450 --> 08:27.480
They're a web advertiser's wet dream.

08:27.490 --> 08:30.900
This is a low-cost company
with global growth potential.

08:30.910 --> 08:34.070
Not to mention, we might actually
do some good for the planet.

08:34.080 --> 08:36.640
You have not changed at all, have you?

08:36.650 --> 08:38.240
A little older, a little wiser.

08:38.270 --> 08:40.750
Well, it doesn't show.
I mean, the older part.

08:40.760 --> 08:42.659
- thank you.
- You're welcome.

08:42.669 --> 08:44.430
I'm so sorry to interject here.

08:44.450 --> 08:48.400
How exactly do you guys
know each other again?

08:48.410 --> 08:53.170
Uh, well, graham and I, uh, actually
worked together briefly at ojai.

08:53.180 --> 08:56.260
Uh, and I can attest that you
guys are working with the best.

08:56.280 --> 09:00.330
I mean, she's a royal pain in
the ass, but she's the best.

09:00.340 --> 09:03.610
coming from another pain in the ass.

09:03.950 --> 09:07.630
But, uh, we're talking about
greenatopia, not about me, so, um...

09:07.650 --> 09:09.360
it is about you a little bit.

09:09.380 --> 09:12.130
I have to, uh, confess that when
I saw your name on the proposal,

09:12.140 --> 09:15.430
I was more than happy to
fill in for my associate.

09:16.380 --> 09:18.530
Sarah, can we have a word
in the conference room?

09:18.540 --> 09:20.080
What's going on out there?
It's like you two are in heat.

09:20.090 --> 09:23.200
- Okay, full disclosure-- graham
and I did date brieflY... - what?

09:23.210 --> 09:23.890
In the past.

09:23.920 --> 09:25.650
So he's here to get in your pants

09:25.660 --> 09:27.920
no.This is business.

09:27.960 --> 09:30.250
Okay, I'm sorry that we're
having a reaction to this.

09:30.280 --> 09:32.720
It's just that we have put
the last two years of our life

09:32.730 --> 09:35.720
not to mention every single penny we have
into this web site, and I am a little-

09:35.750 --> 09:40.330
no, no, scratch that-- I am hugely uncomfortable
with the fact that we have one investor,

09:40.360 --> 09:41.460
and it's your ex sugar daddy.

09:41.480 --> 09:45.180
Graham finch is very
good at what he does.

09:45.200 --> 09:47.050
Thank god, 'cause for a second there,
I thought you were gonna tell me

09:47.080 --> 09:51.090
he was the one who almost flushed
your family business down the toilet.

09:53.040 --> 09:54.240
Okay.

09:54.280 --> 09:55.930
He was a small part of it.

09:55.960 --> 09:57.680
Okay, but he has an
excellent track record.

09:57.700 --> 10:01.990
More importantly, he has access to private
equity funds, funds which we desperately need.

10:02.020 --> 10:05.590
As far as I'm concerned, the fact
that graham and i know each other,

10:05.600 --> 10:07.050
- that could work for us.
- How?

10:07.060 --> 10:11.070
Because he knows he can trust me,
therefore, he can trust the company.

10:11.090 --> 10:13.490
Now you just have to trust me.

10:13.500 --> 10:15.660
Sorry to interrupt you. I've got
another appointment across town.

10:15.670 --> 10:18.640
Listen, I'd love to hear more.
Are you available for dinner?

10:18.650 --> 10:19.860
- Definitely.
- Absolutely.

10:19.870 --> 10:20.720
Yeah. We'll set it uP.

10:20.730 --> 10:24.230
No, I-I pretty much got a handle
on the, uh, the creative side.

10:24.250 --> 10:28.040
I-I need to go over the
financials with the C.F.O.

10:28.050 --> 10:29.400
- You good with that?
- Uh, yeah.

10:29.410 --> 10:31.330
No, I think it's, uh, I
think it's a good idea.

10:31.340 --> 10:32.380
- Good idea.
- 8:00?

10:32.390 --> 10:35.070
- Great.
- Okay. Sounds like a date.

10:36.280 --> 10:37.910
Sounds like a date.

10:37.920 --> 10:39.390
It's an expression.

10:39.400 --> 10:41.190
Oh, thank god you have answered.

10:41.210 --> 10:42.820
Look, kevin, I can barely hear you.

10:42.830 --> 10:45.760
Yeah, that's saul manning
the wet-and-dry vac.

10:45.770 --> 10:47.950
Kitty, I am in the ninth
circle of hell, okay?

10:47.980 --> 10:50.250
Mom has us all down at the
center doing demolition.

10:50.260 --> 10:52.060
She has lost her mind.

10:52.080 --> 10:55.350
Believe me, this is a disaster
of herculean proportion.

10:55.370 --> 10:59.530
She thinks we can do this all by ourselves, so
please come down here, talk some sense into her.

10:59.540 --> 11:01.260
oh, you know what, kevin?
I have to call you back.

11:01.270 --> 11:02.680
No, no,
no!Don't--

11:02.690 --> 11:04.620
hello.

11:06.420 --> 11:09.230
W-well, hi. Hi, trish.

11:11.130 --> 11:16.040
Well, um, sure. No, sure. I-I have
a little time this afternoon, yeah.

11:20.390 --> 11:23.750
I really just wanted to say thanks as
well, for letting me sit in on that meeting.

11:23.760 --> 11:25.490
Well, I should be thanking you.

11:25.510 --> 11:29.120
Really, I was impressed and proud.

11:29.140 --> 11:30.690
Really?

11:30.700 --> 11:35.530
I just--I really-- I really think I'm
starting to get a sense for the wine business.

11:35.540 --> 11:37.310
Oh, no, more than just a sense.

11:37.330 --> 11:41.250
It's just so exciting, you know, from--from
advertising and then meetings with the distributors,

11:41.260 --> 11:43.690
then all of a sudden, you're on the
phone with a farmer about harvest yields.

11:43.730 --> 11:45.900
It's just cool.

11:45.920 --> 11:48.360
Well, if you're interested,
I could teach you.

11:48.380 --> 11:50.660
Yeah, of course I am.

11:51.560 --> 11:54.960
Becca. I think...

11:55.800 --> 11:59.000
that you should work here full-time.

11:59.450 --> 12:00.700
- Are you serious?
- Absolutely.

12:00.710 --> 12:03.380
I mean, you obviously have
a head for advertising.

12:03.400 --> 12:07.660
You could focus on that and learn
the other aspects of the business.

12:07.670 --> 12:11.570
We could create a position for you here.

12:12.150 --> 12:15.900
Well... have you
discussed this with tommy?

12:17.010 --> 12:20.790
I am the C.E.O.Of
this company, remember?

12:20.820 --> 12:24.220
Besides, tommy will be thrilled.

12:26.650 --> 12:27.970
I don't know what to say.

12:27.990 --> 12:30.430
- Say yes.
- Yes.

12:30.440 --> 12:34.080
great. I-- this is
gonna be great. Really.

12:38.010 --> 12:41.750
Okay, does anyone know how
much asbestos is too much?

12:43.350 --> 12:48.970
You know, in a few months when an actual
family is living in this big, beautiful,

12:48.980 --> 12:54.290
warm, friendly home, you all are gonna fe so proud
about all this hard work you're doing here today.

12:54.300 --> 12:56.210
- Oh, dear.
- Oh, dear what?

12:56.220 --> 12:58.350
Well, it looks like you
have a termite infestation.

12:58.360 --> 13:00.950
Since when do you know
anything about infestations?

13:00.960 --> 13:03.510
Well, I used to work for a carpenter
every summer when I was in high school.

13:03.540 --> 13:06.150
I can chisel, drill and plane.

13:06.160 --> 13:07.080
That is hot.

13:07.100 --> 13:08.560
all right, look, nora, this is it.

13:08.590 --> 13:10.720
I think at this point,
we should just reevaluate.

13:10.730 --> 13:12.830
- Yeah, mom, and maybe eat some lunch.
- And you know what?

13:12.840 --> 13:15.970
Get some air, 'cause this dust
is really giving me a migraine.

13:15.990 --> 13:20.060
Here. Take some aspirin. Eat
a protein bar. Anything else?

13:20.070 --> 13:22.900
a glass of pinot grigio.

13:25.320 --> 13:27.550
So you--you--
you look bigger.

13:27.570 --> 13:30.160
I mean, well, just your belly,
not--not the rest of you.

13:30.170 --> 13:32.020
kitty, it's fine.

13:32.040 --> 13:34.740
I actually lost sight of
my feet about a week ago.

13:34.760 --> 13:36.810
Pregnancy milestone, I suppose.

13:36.850 --> 13:41.590
But, uh, this baby-- sometimes it feels
like it's wearing steel-toed boots.

13:41.600 --> 13:43.560
Is there like, a--
a lot of kicking?

13:43.590 --> 13:46.510
Oh, yeah.

13:52.730 --> 13:58.510
uh, kitty, I called because, uh,
I wanted to say to you, in person,

13:59.460 --> 14:02.390
I'm sorry.

14:02.400 --> 14:03.970
For what?

14:03.990 --> 14:06.590
Changing my mind.

14:06.600 --> 14:09.480
I-it was unfair to you and to robert.

14:09.510 --> 14:11.310
You don't owe us an apology.

14:11.330 --> 14:15.600
You had ever prerogative to reconsider,
and robert and I knew that going in.

14:15.620 --> 14:18.830
You know, the truth of it is, I
st asked you too many questions.

14:18.840 --> 14:22.970
Oh, god, you had every right to ask me as
many questions as you wanted answers to.

14:22.980 --> 14:27.270
Mm, well, my mother even tells me
that I can be overbearing at times.

14:27.280 --> 14:28.350
No, kitty, you were fine.

14:28.370 --> 14:33.960
You just wanted to know that I had considered
everything, and truth be told, I hadn'T.

14:33.970 --> 14:40.100
I didn't want to think about how I'd feel once the
baby was born or if I'd regret it in a few years.

14:40.320 --> 14:43.390
I was perfectly happy not
to think about any of that.

14:43.410 --> 14:49.950
But after a lot of soul-searching
and, uh, some sleepless nights,

14:49.960 --> 14:54.060
I have to say, thanks to you...

14:54.600 --> 14:58.120
I'm actually at peace with my decision.

14:59.560 --> 15:01.310
I don't want to be a mother.

15:01.340 --> 15:02.880
And, you know, kitty, the
more I thought about it,

15:02.910 --> 15:08.330
the more I realized what was
right for me and this baby, and...

15:09.160 --> 15:12.920
that's you and robert.

15:13.720 --> 15:17.410
I know you have no
reason to trust me, but...

15:17.420 --> 15:23.920
if you still want to adopt
this baby, I'd really love that.

15:27.680 --> 15:30.490
*******It looks like this
might be water damage.

15:30.510 --> 15:33.350
Justin, would you concentrate on what
you're doing? That thing looks rotten.

15:33.360 --> 15:37.020
Okay, I am concentrating, and if you know so
much about it, why don't you come here and do it?

15:37.030 --> 15:38.940
I can't because my spirit's broken.

15:38.950 --> 15:41.020
I don't even know why I'm here anymore.

15:41.040 --> 15:44.140
You're here to help
families with sick children.

15:44.160 --> 15:46.430
Think about that when you work.

15:46.440 --> 15:51.300
You know what? I don't think there's
even any pipes near that section,

15:51.310 --> 15:54.440
not on the plans.Look. It must be
just some sort of weird discoloration.

15:54.450 --> 15:56.260
Do you even know how to read plans?

15:56.280 --> 15:57.500
Scotty! Scotty! Watch it!

15:57.510 --> 15:59.130
For god sake, just!
You almost killed him.

15:59.140 --> 16:00.410
Look, I'm sorry, kevin!
Are you all right, scotty?

16:00.420 --> 16:03.230
Guys, guys, I'm fine.

16:03.240 --> 16:05.110
I'm trying to achieve a state of zen.

16:05.130 --> 16:06.090
Thank you, scotty.

16:06.100 --> 16:08.150
I said I'm trying.

16:08.160 --> 16:09.300
- Hey, everyone.
- pizza!

16:09.310 --> 16:11.420
I ran into the pizza guy out front.

16:11.440 --> 16:15.080
So we have two veggie and two
everything, and it's on me.

16:15.090 --> 16:17.270
No, no, no, no. I ordered
it. I'll pay for it.

16:17.280 --> 16:20.990
No, no, um, I wanted to,
because I just got a promotion.

16:21.010 --> 16:23.350
- Wow, honey.Congratulations.
- You did?

16:23.360 --> 16:26.170
Thanks. I'm gonna be working in
advertising at walker landing.

16:26.180 --> 16:29.700
So basically I coordinate with the
ad agency, oversee special projects.

16:29.720 --> 16:31.290
- That's huge, you know?
- Yeah.

16:31.300 --> 16:33.980
Temp one day, exec the next?

16:34.000 --> 16:36.150
Yeah, well, I mean,
it's not that sudden.

16:36.170 --> 16:41.100
No, and if tommy feels you're ready,
well, then i-I-- I guess you are.

16:41.120 --> 16:46.420
Yeah, yeah. Well, actually, he's out of town,
but my mom thinks that it should be fine, so...

16:46.430 --> 16:49.030
Yeah.

16:49.990 --> 16:52.560
What's with all the looks?

16:52.570 --> 16:53.920
- I'm just hungry.
- Starving.

16:53.930 --> 16:56.890
- Yeah, over here. Take this whole box right here.
- You gotta admit, you're not exactly qualified for that.

16:56.900 --> 17:00.460
About as qualified as you
four are to do construction.

17:00.470 --> 17:02.020
- Look, I didn't-- -
it's a great house, nora.

17:02.030 --> 17:03.610
No, wait. You're not goin are you?

17:03.620 --> 17:06.440
Well, seeing as I'm not
qualified for my new job,

17:06.450 --> 17:08.099
I should probably go home and
brush up on my new responsibilities.

17:08.119 --> 17:09.970
I didn't--rebecca, I
didn't mean it like--

17:09.980 --> 17:11.880
I'm going home.We'll talk later.

17:11.890 --> 17:13.760
thank you for the pizza, rebecca.

17:13.790 --> 17:16.540
Looks like you're staying at mom'S.

17:22.000 --> 17:25.530
so, uh, how have youeen? How's
the family, you know, the kids?

17:25.540 --> 17:27.710
- They're good.
- Yeah? You seeing anyone?

17:27.720 --> 17:30.770
you cut right to it.

17:30.790 --> 17:34.340
Um, no. No, I'm not. How about you?

17:34.350 --> 17:35.650
Still got a girl in every city?

17:35.680 --> 17:39.420
I cut back to, uh, cities
with over two million residents

17:39.440 --> 17:42.390
- 'cause I'm not as young as I once was.
- That's true.

17:42.400 --> 17:44.850
So are we gonna keep flirting, or
are we gonna talk about greenatopia?

17:44.860 --> 17:46.290
I wasn't flirting, you were.

17:46.310 --> 17:48.850
And yes, yes, let's
talk about greenatopia.

17:48.870 --> 17:50.560
I read the proposal,
I went on the web site.

17:50.590 --> 17:51.670
- It's all very promising.
- Good.

17:51.680 --> 17:54.530
But I have to tell you, that's an awful lot
of early money at this stage of the game.

17:54.550 --> 17:55.440
So give me a figure.

17:55.460 --> 17:58.790
A million to start, plus an
additional three in the growth phase.

17:58.800 --> 17:59.980
- That's not too shabby.
- No.

17:59.990 --> 18:02.380
- What's the catch?
- There's no catch at all.

18:02.390 --> 18:06.550
We'd just ask for 30% ownership,
you'd be kicked up to C.E.O.,

18:06.560 --> 18:09.020
And we'd give kyle and
ethan a-a happy exit.

18:09.050 --> 18:11.970
This is their baby. They're--they're--they're
not gonna want to sell out.

18:11.980 --> 18:16.110
All right. You drive a hard bargain.
We'll keep 'em on as cofounders.

18:17.590 --> 18:20.800
I'm not sure they would
accept a token offer.

18:20.820 --> 18:22.140
This is their big idea.

18:22.160 --> 18:25.260
It's a good idea, and, uh,
there's no shortage of good ideas.

18:25.280 --> 18:29.420
What there is a shortage of is people
talented enough to execute those good ideas,

18:29.460 --> 18:31.930
and you're one of those people.

18:31.960 --> 18:33.600
Now if my firm is gonna
make this kind of investment,

18:33.610 --> 18:39.140
we have to know that there'll be somebody who's
responsible enough to oversee it--that's you.

18:39.420 --> 18:42.710
Now come on, you'd be making a
competitive salary, full benefits package.

18:42.750 --> 18:46.820
You'd have a conference room that doesn't
have a-- a garbage disposal in it, okay?

18:46.830 --> 18:48.290
this is a solid offer.

18:48.300 --> 18:49.370
It's very tempting.

18:49.390 --> 18:54.960
I'm willing to stake a million dollars
of my firm's money on this, on you,

18:55.360 --> 18:59.180
because I know a good
thing when I see it.

19:00.060 --> 19:03.410
Are we still talking about greenatopia?

19:03.430 --> 19:05.620
I hope not.

19:11.890 --> 19:13.290
- That was nice.
- That was presumptuous.

19:13.300 --> 19:16.110
It was more than nice.

19:16.670 --> 19:19.200
I'm not sure I can talk
business after that.

19:19.230 --> 19:25.140
Me, too, which is exactly why you
should jump on this while I'm vulnerable.

19:28.580 --> 19:30.970
oh, you know, look...

19:31.010 --> 19:34.670
the boys are at home, anxiously awaiting
to hear about the future of their company.

19:34.690 --> 19:37.180
Let me...

19:37.200 --> 19:41.170
mull it over, and I'll,
uh, I'll get back to you.

19:41.180 --> 19:42.270
What, no dinner?

19:42.280 --> 19:45.710
I'm not hungry for food.

19:46.420 --> 19:48.420
So she just calls you out of the blue?

19:48.450 --> 19:52.550
Yeah, I-I was thrown, too, but--but
I think that maybe it's a sign.

19:52.570 --> 19:54.850
The only thing it's a sign
of is how indecisive she is.

19:54.880 --> 19:57.050
First she gives us the boot, now she's
begging us to be the parents again?

19:57.080 --> 19:58.220
She's not begging.

19:58.250 --> 20:02.500
She's--she's just had some time to think it
over, and she knows now that we're the ones.

20:02.520 --> 20:04.180
We were the ones, and she pulled out.

20:04.190 --> 20:09.300
Robert, I understand your reluctance.
I do. But I'm--I'M... chills.

20:09.310 --> 20:10.980
Okay? Come on. You loved her before.

20:10.990 --> 20:12.570
Before.

20:12.590 --> 20:14.580
Look, this is just
messy and complicated.

20:14.590 --> 20:17.950
Oh, would you guys stop nay-saying?

20:17.980 --> 20:19.760
The place isn't complicated and messy.

20:19.780 --> 20:21.580
You haven't even walked
through the house.

20:21.590 --> 20:23.560
We're not nay-saying the house, mother.

20:23.580 --> 20:27.290
Oh, although we're not
not nay-saying it either.

20:27.990 --> 20:29.420
- Is everything all right?
- Everything's fine.

20:29.430 --> 20:31.180
I heard that you needed reinforcements,

20:31.190 --> 20:35.460
and nothing makes me happier than keeping democratic
bureaucrats waiting while I do a little honest work.

20:35.480 --> 20:36.230
You're staying?

20:36.250 --> 20:37.890
Yeah, yeah, ten minutes. It'll be fine.

20:37.900 --> 20:40.500
The--the boys are
upstairs pulling carpet.

20:40.510 --> 20:42.620
- Careful, it's dark.
- I live for pulling carpet.

20:42.630 --> 20:44.210
Yeah, I won't be pulling any carpets.

20:44.220 --> 20:46.220
Are you sure everything's okay?

20:46.230 --> 20:47.880
- Fine.
- Great. Will you hold this?

20:47.890 --> 20:50.350
I'm making a stack of all these. I
don't want to miss this one over here.

20:50.360 --> 20:53.160
You need these, though. It's
just--hold that for one second.

20:53.170 --> 20:55.400
Now you've gotta collect
all this stuff somewhere.

20:55.420 --> 21:00.380
- Mom, mom, I am wearing a very expensive coat.
- Just hold it for one second.

21:06.790 --> 21:08.650
I'll get it.

21:11.740 --> 21:12.930
W-where's ethan?

21:12.950 --> 21:15.790
Where he, uh, always is.

21:17.100 --> 21:21.590
So, uh... tell me, how
was, uh, how was dinner?

21:21.600 --> 21:25.200
Well, we, um... we got an offer.

21:25.210 --> 21:27.910
- Oh, my god.
- Are you serious? How much?

21:28.480 --> 21:29.920
- A million dollars to start.
- What?

21:29.930 --> 21:32.670
$3 million when we're up and running.

21:35.650 --> 21:36.740
dude!

21:36.750 --> 21:40.890
You know, not to mention
offices, you know, real offices,

21:40.930 --> 21:45.310
and, uh, health insurance,
401(k)s, all th good stuff.

21:45.330 --> 21:47.680
This is so fr--sarah, I-I don't
even-- I mean, thank you so much.

21:47.690 --> 21:50.570
Seriously, thank you so
much. A million dollars?

21:50.580 --> 21:52.460
- So wait, what are the terms?
- Boilerplate stuff.

21:52.470 --> 21:54.540
- They want to bring in their own company director.
- RighT.

21:54.550 --> 21:56.720
Standard. They did offer me C.E.O.

21:56.730 --> 21:58.210
- Nice.
- Nice. Congrats.

21:58.220 --> 22:00.890
And they want to keep
you guys on as cofounders.

22:00.900 --> 22:02.020
Cofounders?

22:02.030 --> 22:06.140
Um, I-I don't-- I don't even know what is--
what's--what--that--what does that entail, cofounders?

22:06.150 --> 22:08.660
You'd be like the
figureheads of greenatopia.

22:08.670 --> 22:09.680
Figureheads?

22:09.720 --> 22:10.930
Don't get hung up on the title.

22:10.940 --> 22:16.650
The thing is, your ideas would be considered--
strongly considered-- by management and the board.

22:16.660 --> 22:19.550
- We don't get a vote?
- No.

22:19.560 --> 22:23.690
But I do, and I guarantee
that your ideas will be heard.

22:23.710 --> 22:25.130
Sarah, nO. This is our company.

22:25.140 --> 22:26.290
You'll still be part of it.

22:26.310 --> 22:28.690
Only it won't be our company anymore.

22:28.720 --> 22:29.910
I mean, that's what this is, right?

22:29.930 --> 22:33.580
You get a great new job,
and kyle and I get what?

22:33.590 --> 22:36.420
I mean, what are we, like, the
taco bell chihuahua or something?

22:36.440 --> 22:40.180
no, you would still
have an enormous stake.

22:40.190 --> 22:41.790
Guys, this is good.

22:41.800 --> 22:44.490
No, yeah, it's good for you.

22:44.500 --> 22:48.320
You knew that wherever we took
this, we'd have to compromise.

22:48.360 --> 22:52.510
Yeah, of course, we know that, but we also know that
you just essentially sold us out for a million dollars.

22:52.530 --> 22:55.640
- And a retirement plan.
- And a retirement plan.

22:57.890 --> 22:59.380
This is as good as it gets.

22:59.390 --> 23:04.260
That's right, because the economy is in a tailspin
and you've got a mortgage and an ex-husband--

23:04.280 --> 23:05.810
and alimony and health insurance.

23:05.840 --> 23:09.780
Yes, I have responsibilities,
kyle, and I'm proud of them.

23:13.520 --> 23:16.700
okay, so the offer isn't perfect.

23:16.710 --> 23:18.060
But it is the only offer we got,

23:18.070 --> 23:22.950
and I guarantee both of you that I
negotiated us the best possible deal.

23:22.980 --> 23:24.620
Seriously, sarah?

23:24.640 --> 23:27.110
I'm--I'm not so sure
anymore, you know?

23:27.120 --> 23:31.060
I'm not so sureI trust that you
negotiated the best terms possible for us.

23:31.070 --> 23:32.860
I-- we don't have
a choice anymore.

23:32.870 --> 23:34.270
We've eaten through our savings.

23:34.290 --> 23:36.930
We don't even have enough money
to pay the rent past next month.

23:36.960 --> 23:41.240
He's right. We got turned down by what,
there was 127 other possible investors?

23:41.250 --> 23:44.020
So we're gonna take this,
right? We don't have a choice.

23:44.030 --> 23:46.100
But come on, at least for a second,

23:46.120 --> 23:50.050
show us enough respect to not act
like you didn't sell us out here.

23:50.460 --> 23:54.060
I don't even know what to say to that.

23:56.320 --> 23:59.490
I think you just say good night.

24:04.760 --> 24:06.860
Good night.

24:13.240 --> 24:15.930
Voil? here's your new office.

24:19.210 --> 24:21.590
But this is saul's old office.

24:21.600 --> 24:23.800
Do you think it's
weird for me to be here?

24:23.820 --> 24:26.600
I don't know. Uh, would you
be more comfortable in sarah's?

24:26.610 --> 24:30.920
No, no. I'm--this is...
thanks. okay. Thank you.

24:30.930 --> 24:32.530
Feel free to make yourself at home.

24:32.550 --> 24:36.640
Hang up some of your photographs
or get some throw pillows.

24:39.060 --> 24:40.520
What's wrong?

24:40.530 --> 24:43.650
I don't know. Did you give me this
job just because I'm your daughter?

24:43.660 --> 24:47.010
Because let's be honest. I mean, I
don't-- I don't have any experience.

24:47.020 --> 24:51.190
I'm giving you this job because
you're smart and talented,

24:51.220 --> 24:54.240
and I think that you'll be
an asset to this company.

24:54.250 --> 24:58.950
But would i have given you this
job if you weren't my daughter?

24:58.980 --> 25:02.590
Maybe not. But that's what people do.

25:02.600 --> 25:05.370
That's what william did.

25:05.390 --> 25:10.780
But I wouldn't be giving you this job if I
didn't think that you were up for the challenge.

25:10.790 --> 25:15.270
I opened the door. Now it's up to you.

25:18.240 --> 25:20.680
Thank you for being honest.

25:20.690 --> 25:23.820
And I promise, I'm gonna--
I'm gonna do my very best.

25:24.870 --> 25:27.360
I know you will.

25:31.920 --> 25:36.830
This is so great, you and I here
together, getting our hands dirty.

25:36.840 --> 25:38.260
Yeah, this is good.

25:38.270 --> 25:43.460
Pulling out walls is much better than banging
my head against the one that is my husband.

25:43.780 --> 25:48.490
We're here to fix up this house, not
to dismember your significant other.

25:48.510 --> 25:50.860
Yeah, well, I can multitask.

25:51.850 --> 25:54.260
- Hi, honey.
- Hey, sarah.

25:54.270 --> 25:56.220
- Well, this is nice, mom.
- Yeah.

25:56.230 --> 25:58.070
Oh, can I borrow this?

25:58.080 --> 25:59.040
Great. You know what?

25:59.050 --> 26:01.280
If you start at the bottom
and work your way up,

26:01.290 --> 26:04.510
I think that's actually what
works--well, that's good, too.

26:04.530 --> 26:05.850
Why does she get the sledgehammer?

26:05.870 --> 26:10.050
Greenatopia got offered a
million-dollar cash infusion today.

26:10.060 --> 26:13.010
- No, seriously, mom. That's amazing.
- Well, who gave you a million dollars?

26:13.020 --> 26:14.500
No, no, don't-- don't
answer that, sarah,

26:14.510 --> 26:17.510
- because she'll want to steal your investor for
a donation.Yes, you would. - No, sh-sh--oh, stop.

26:17.520 --> 26:19.020
Honey, w gave you a million dollars?

26:19.030 --> 26:21.130
Graham finch.

26:22.720 --> 26:24.490
are you and graham
still seeing each other?

26:24.510 --> 26:26.640
No, mother. His firm's
interested in the company.

26:26.650 --> 26:30.890
So we had a meeting, we discussed the future of
the company, and we had a drink and we kissed.

26:30.900 --> 26:34.620
Wow, that must have been a doozy of a kiss
if you got a million dollars out of it.

26:34.630 --> 26:36.040
It wasn't a trade, kitty.

26:36.050 --> 26:37.160
well, I-I don't
understand, if you--

26:37.170 --> 26:40.480
if you just made a million-dollar
deal, why are you so upset?

26:40.500 --> 26:43.280
I'm not upset, mother.

26:46.190 --> 26:48.140
kyle and ethan are furious at me.

26:48.170 --> 26:49.320
They think I tried to sell them out.

26:49.340 --> 26:51.550
I try to make them rich,
and now they hate me.

26:51.560 --> 26:53.390
Well, did you try to sell them out?

26:53.410 --> 26:57.900
No, I made a necessary and financially
lucrative business compromise.

26:57.920 --> 27:01.320
They'll be thanking me when they're 40.

27:02.690 --> 27:04.450
senator, a hand would be nice.

27:04.460 --> 27:06.640
Secretary of state trumps carpets.

27:06.660 --> 27:08.530
wait, what are you doing
here? You have to go.

27:08.540 --> 27:09.820
What are you doing? We need him.

27:09.830 --> 27:10.620
I'm doing my job.

27:10.630 --> 27:11.950
Look, it's okay. I can multitask.

27:11.960 --> 27:13.690
Good, then multitask away.

27:13.700 --> 27:18.830
Guys, here's the deal-- why don't we just open
this window and throw the carpet out there?

27:18.850 --> 27:20.110
That's leaded glass. It doesn't open.

27:20.120 --> 27:22.320
That's the only decent thing in this
dump. Do you really want to break it?

27:22.330 --> 27:24.340
Yes. I'll pay for a new one.

27:24.350 --> 27:25.900
I have never been more
serious in my life.

27:25.930 --> 27:29.490
I have no intentions of ever
touching this carpet again.

27:37.310 --> 27:39.700
Oh, mom!

27:42.450 --> 27:44.530
is everybody okay?

27:44.760 --> 27:47.100
Uh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, we're okay.

27:47.110 --> 27:48.930
No. No.

27:48.940 --> 27:51.150
Mom, look...

27:51.170 --> 27:55.550
I'm sure, um, you know, someone
will be able to fix this.

27:55.560 --> 27:57.070
- I mean, yoknow, obviously not us...
- right.

27:57.080 --> 28:00.810
- A contractor. - I'm
sure someone can, ma-maybe.

28:01.210 --> 28:03.980
I could've killed myself. I
could've killed one of you.

28:03.990 --> 28:05.160
Oh, come on,
mom.It's--

28:05.170 --> 28:08.620
no, no, this house is
nothing but rotten wood.

28:08.650 --> 28:11.740
You all tried to tell me-- the
moldy walls, the collapsing ceiling.

28:11.760 --> 28:14.910
I was just too stubborn to listen. I...

28:15.890 --> 28:20.900
I thought we could save it--
our special family project, my...

28:22.120 --> 28:25.280
ojai foods. GoD.

28:26.350 --> 28:30.010
How could I make such
a colossal mistake?

28:33.150 --> 28:35.900
Mom. Mom. Hey, you
know what? You're right.

28:35.910 --> 28:39.510
This house is a-- well,
it's a--it's a mess.

28:39.520 --> 28:42.200
It's a complete and utter mess.

28:42.210 --> 28:43.930
I just said that, kitty.

28:44.000 --> 28:47.770
Yes, you--you did, but you know what?
Maybe that's okay. Maybe that's okay.

28:47.780 --> 28:51.650
I mean, a lot of great things come
out of messy, complicated situations

28:51.670 --> 28:53.510
because, you know, they're
just meant to be, right?

28:53.540 --> 28:57.700
Well, yeah, but, you know, there's a lot
to be said for clean, orderly, simple.

28:57.710 --> 29:00.090
No, come on, kevin.
You love complicated.

29:00.100 --> 29:02.670
You--why did you go
to work for robert?

29:02.680 --> 29:04.150
- Well, because he didn't make partner.
- What?

29:04.160 --> 29:05.930
No, I wanted to make a difference.

29:05.940 --> 29:06.910
Right. Right.

29:06.920 --> 29:12.650
Because mom has always taught us, for better or
for worse, that complicated things can--can be good.

29:12.680 --> 29:14.060
yeah. I get the argument.

29:14.070 --> 29:17.430
Right, of course you agree,
because you ran for president.

29:17.460 --> 29:19.690
Nothing simple about that.
And then there's sarah.

29:19.700 --> 29:23.040
- Sarah is in business with 2 teenagers for god sake.
- Oh, well, they're 28.

29:23.050 --> 29:26.270
She goes out to dinner with her ex-boy toy,
she kisses him and she gets a million dollars.

29:26.280 --> 29:27.810
I mean, that's complicated.

29:27.820 --> 29:29.580
- Complicated.
- That's complicated.

29:29.590 --> 29:30.910
You know what? Then there's justin.

29:30.920 --> 29:33.900
Justin's an addict, and he went to war.

29:33.910 --> 29:35.710
Okay, and then there's
uncle saul. I mean, that...

29:35.720 --> 29:37.690
- hello.
- That is incredibly complicated.

29:37.700 --> 29:42.360
Kitty, I so appreciate you trying
to cheer me up, but it isn't--

29:42.370 --> 29:45.850
no, no.No buts.

29:45.860 --> 29:47.660
You're not allowed to give up.

29:47.680 --> 29:53.150
You're not allowed to give up because you
believe in your gut that this is right.

29:53.160 --> 29:58.880
And--and--and besides, we've--we've all
inherited this--this-- this absurd drive to--

29:58.900 --> 30:02.790
to make things that--that, yes, they
seem complicated and they're messy,

30:02.820 --> 30:04.590
but we can turn 'em
into something great.

30:04.600 --> 30:06.610
- yeah.
- right?

30:07.190 --> 30:07.950
right.

30:07.960 --> 30:11.790
And if you give up, well, then there's
just no hope for the rest of us.

30:11.820 --> 30:13.970
don't
give up--

30:15.000 --> 30:21.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

30:23.460 --> 30:25.790
oh, man.

30:30.520 --> 30:33.050
Thanks anyway, kitty.

30:38.030 --> 30:39.320
Look, I know you can set this up.

30:39.350 --> 30:41.520
I-I need a face-to-face
as soon as possible.

30:41.540 --> 30:44.540
So, um, could you give
me a call? I, um...

30:44.550 --> 30:48.400
well, I have something I just
want to bounce off of you.

30:48.410 --> 30:51.290
So... call me when you can.

30:53.760 --> 30:55.070
Thanks

30:55.100 --> 30:56.820
Everything okay?

30:56.830 --> 30:59.400
Oh, yeah.

31:00.220 --> 31:04.630
Look, obviously, I work for you, but we
don't always have to be so professional, okay?

31:04.640 --> 31:07.150
We are related. I am your brother.

31:07.160 --> 31:10.570
We just have an "in"
and a "law" attached.

31:11.660 --> 31:14.610
Did kitty tell you that i
had brought up surrogacy?

31:14.640 --> 31:16.430
I mean, with what we've gone
through with the birth mother,

31:16.440 --> 31:18.520
it just think it's the simple,
straightforward thing to do.

31:18.540 --> 31:21.250
The baby would be ours
legally and biologically.

31:21.270 --> 31:22.290
So let me guess.

31:22.310 --> 31:25.160
You'd rather a surrogate,
kitty wants trish?

31:25.170 --> 31:26.550
Yeah, exactly.

31:26.590 --> 31:31.000
And look, I-I get it, if this goes
well, we have a baby in three months.

31:31.020 --> 31:35.990
But now kitty's got feelings and
she's got chills, and, I mean,

31:36.020 --> 31:39.520
I'm willing to stand down, but
if she's wrong about this...

31:39.530 --> 31:44.500
look, take kitty off
the table for a moment.

31:44.530 --> 31:47.540
What do you want?

31:51.350 --> 31:53.730
I guess I don't know.

31:53.750 --> 31:56.220
Thanks for stopping by my office.

31:56.250 --> 31:58.950
It's not gonna be your office for long.

31:59.700 --> 32:02.430
Yeah. Listen,
graham, I just-- I...

32:02.440 --> 32:05.810
I want to thank you
for your faith in me...

32:05.820 --> 32:09.700
And for being prepared to
take a risk with greenatopia.

32:09.720 --> 32:12.170
But you're backing out, right?

32:12.190 --> 32:15.000
- I'm backing out.
- oh, boy.

32:15.010 --> 32:18.030
Oh, man. I haven't even
made a pass at you yet today.

32:18.040 --> 32:22.760
Pass or no pass, we can't
accept your offer. I'm sorry.

32:24.210 --> 32:27.290
Look, I-I-if this is
a negotiating tactic,

32:27.300 --> 32:30.540
I actually do have a little wiggle
room on the initial, uh, investment.

32:30.550 --> 32:31.690
I'm not negotiating.

32:31.710 --> 32:34.070
Well, then this better be
because you got a better offer.

32:34.080 --> 32:36.970
It doesn't have to do with,
uh, you know, mutt and jeff.

32:37.000 --> 32:41.170
it's ethan and kyle. And yeah,
actually, this is about them.

32:41.180 --> 32:44.860
I don't want them to settle for a
token role in a company they began.

32:44.880 --> 32:46.390
You're gettin' soft, kid.

32:46.410 --> 32:49.250
I'm not soft.

32:49.280 --> 32:50.280
Maybe a little bit.

32:50.290 --> 32:51.610
I'm offering you a bird in the hand.

32:51.620 --> 32:56.240
I know that, and it is very tempting.

32:56.260 --> 33:01.770
But I--I've taken a risk with these guys-- probably
the biggest risk of my professional career--

33:01.790 --> 33:07.400
because they inspired me to with
their enthusiasm and their optimism,

33:07.410 --> 33:09.420
and I want to stay a part of that.

33:09.440 --> 33:11.650
I can't sell them out because
mr. Handsome walks in...

33:11.670 --> 33:13.810
and offers me a salary with benefits.

33:13.820 --> 33:15.400
So this is about the kiss, isn't it?

33:15.410 --> 33:16.320
Oh, you're unbelievable.

33:16.350 --> 33:17.800
Hey, no, no, you're the one who brought
handsomeness into the conversation.

33:17.810 --> 33:19.100
Yeah, as a side note.

33:19.110 --> 33:23.560
Yeah, just so you know, I was
looking for an excuse to look you up.

33:23.580 --> 33:26.150
I know that.

33:26.160 --> 33:27.970
I think about you.

33:28.000 --> 33:32.640
Graham, I'm flattered, but there
was a reason that we didn't work.

33:32.660 --> 33:34.240
Well, I'm not asking for
your hand in marriage.

33:34.260 --> 33:38.360
I know that, too. But
really, you know, what?

33:39.190 --> 33:40.350
A fling?

33:40.360 --> 33:42.800
You travel all the
time, I'm rooted here.

33:42.810 --> 33:44.500
Well, I'm here now.

33:44.510 --> 33:46.120
Good-bye, mr. Finch.

33:46.130 --> 33:49.350
- It was nice seeing you.
- You, too.

34:02.660 --> 34:04.440
Just so you know,
this is that one last--

34:04.460 --> 34:06.480
yeah, I got it.I got it.

34:06.510 --> 34:08.639
just do me a favor. Don't
turn around yet. Okay?

34:08.650 --> 34:10.860
- What, did the rest of the ceiling cave in?
- No.

34:10.870 --> 34:14.020
Did you find a family of possums
living in the crawl space?

34:14.030 --> 34:17.750
- Why are you dragging me in here?
- Mom, mom, mom, be quiet, all right? Just be quiet.

34:20.610 --> 34:23.840
Do i at least get a cigarette
and a chance to say my last words?

34:23.860 --> 34:26.520
Oh, I-I think you're gonna
owe us big-time for this one.

34:26.530 --> 34:29.440
Okay, nora, turn around.

34:29.469 --> 34:32.230
come on.

34:33.860 --> 34:36.400
Oh, my god. What...

34:36.730 --> 34:39.080
what is th-- what did
you-- did you--did you--

34:39.090 --> 34:41.429
just a little something we whipped
up this morning, that's all.

34:41.440 --> 34:45.770
yeah, when the ceiling came down, some plaster
fell from the adjoining wall, and there it was.

34:45.790 --> 34:46.770
It's amazing.

34:46.780 --> 34:50.800
See, without you forcing us to demolish
this place, we never would've found it.

34:53.460 --> 34:54.840
All right, I'm keeping the house.

34:54.860 --> 34:56.580
oh, sweetheart, that's great news.

34:56.600 --> 35:01.020
And you're gonna get an
architect and a contractor.

35:01.440 --> 35:04.190
- yeS.
- yes!

35:07.830 --> 35:09.130
Hey, what's going on?

35:09.150 --> 35:13.270
Hey, uh, uh, well, I'm just
moving into my new office.

35:14.020 --> 35:15.740
Did-didn't my mom tell you?

35:15.750 --> 35:19.430
No, no. I... I haven't seen her yet.

35:20.240 --> 35:25.360
Well, she offered me, um, a
position managing advertising.

35:28.070 --> 35:30.560
You know, if you want to go talk to her, I
can just go back to my desk and--and wait--

35:30.570 --> 35:34.790
no, no. No, no, no. She
offered, you accepted.

35:34.800 --> 35:39.280
seriously, congratulations.
We're... we're lucky to have you.

35:40.610 --> 35:42.140
- Thanks.
- why wasn't I told?

35:42.150 --> 35:44.400
I made an executive decision.

35:44.420 --> 35:47.740
Right, aside from the fact that I should've been
consulted, how long has she been working here?

35:47.750 --> 35:49.500
What, two, three months?

35:49.550 --> 35:51.680
You know, tommy, you're just
gonna have to trust me on this one.

35:51.710 --> 35:54.660
Look, I trusted you when you said
we couldn't afford kevin's law firm.

35:54.670 --> 35:56.390
I fired my brother.

35:56.400 --> 35:58.600
And now you're offering your
daughter an executive position?

35:58.610 --> 36:02.140
It was your decision
fire kevin, not mine.

36:02.150 --> 36:05.430
Now I know that she is inperienced,
but she will learn on the job.

36:05.440 --> 36:07.630
Sarah and I started
out in the warehouse.

36:07.650 --> 36:08.590
That's how we do it.

36:08.600 --> 36:11.420
Our employees start from the ground up.

36:11.450 --> 36:14.950
Yeah, well, I have a different
management philosophy than your father.

36:14.960 --> 36:17.020
my father made this company a success.

36:17.040 --> 36:21.310
This company is not your
family business anymore.

36:22.370 --> 36:26.200
well, you have made
that very, very clear.

36:26.220 --> 36:30.180
So take it to the boar let them decide.

36:31.840 --> 36:35.240
That won't be necessary.

36:56.310 --> 36:57.680
Can I come in?

36:57.700 --> 37:00.230
Uh, yeah, of course.

37:01.350 --> 37:04.280
Nice office. This, uh,
used to be saul's, right?

37:04.290 --> 37:06.560
Uh, yeah. Yeah.

37:08.570 --> 37:15.030
Well, I got you an "I suck and I should've
been more supportive/ office warming" present.

37:15.040 --> 37:18.820
I don't even know if
that exists, but here.

37:18.830 --> 37:21.490
Thank you.

37:21.500 --> 37:23.810
Rebecca, I was wrong.

37:23.840 --> 37:28.680
Maybe it's easier to concentrate on
your career than my lack of one. I...

37:29.510 --> 37:33.630
but if this is something that you
want, I'm really happy for you.

37:33.930 --> 37:36.090
Look, I know my mom
gave me a big break here.

37:36.110 --> 37:38.460
I really think that I
could be good at this.

37:38.470 --> 37:41.830
I know you'll be good at this.

37:41.840 --> 37:43.490
Well, on that note,
I'm gonna let you work,

37:43.510 --> 37:48.090
because it's your first day and I
don't want to get you fired, so bye.

37:48.120 --> 37:50.760
Thank you.

38:03.940 --> 38:07.920
good news. We're still poor.

38:09.470 --> 38:12.690
- Can I come in?
- yeah.

38:20.240 --> 38:21.420
you were right.

38:21.450 --> 38:25.740
Greenatopia is your company, and
you deserve to steer its future.

38:27.420 --> 38:31.400
I'm sorry if you felt that
I tried to sell you out.

38:31.410 --> 38:34.850
I really want to be part of this.

38:35.430 --> 38:36.650
Sarah...

38:36.660 --> 38:40.850
I kind of feel like we're this band,
you know, and you're the lead singer,

38:40.870 --> 38:45.750
and you signed with the big record labe and
you left the rest of the band high and dry.

38:45.760 --> 38:49.850
You know, you screwed up. It's gonna
be tough for us to trust you again.

38:50.610 --> 38:53.780
Oh, come on. I brought pizza.

38:58.880 --> 39:01.550
Please.

39:02.030 --> 39:03.750
So you really turned
down a million dollars?

39:03.760 --> 39:06.830
Oh, yeah--a million dollars, an
actual salary, expense account,

39:06.840 --> 39:08.740
benefits and an ongoing sex life.

39:08.770 --> 39:09.640
I could help you with that part.

39:09.670 --> 39:11.010
- I'm good for now.
- Okay.

39:11.020 --> 39:14.620
- What I do want is a beer.
- Done.

39:21.430 --> 39:23.890
you good?

39:26.090 --> 39:28.320
poverty.

39:32.210 --> 39:34.620
- there's the heart.
- I think I see a hand.

39:34.630 --> 39:36.430
Right there, by the baby's head.

39:36.440 --> 39:38.120
Oh, yeah.

39:38.140 --> 39:39.560
It's running for president.

39:39.580 --> 39:42.500
it's--it's--
it's waving at us.

39:42.510 --> 39:44.620
saying hi to mommy and daddy.

39:44.650 --> 39:46.850
look, the baby's gonna turn now.

39:46.870 --> 39:49.490
No wonder it feels like
something's punching my cervix.

39:49.510 --> 39:52.550
Look at its little face.

39:52.570 --> 39:56.730
Would you two like to
know the sex of theaby?

39:57.170 --> 40:00.390
Uh, no. No. I think
we'll keep it a surprise.

40:00.400 --> 40:04.670
Oh, god. It'S... it's beautiful, huh?

40:17.030 --> 40:18.080
Okay, tommy.

40:18.100 --> 40:21.930
Why am I being summoned here
in the wee hours of the night?

40:21.940 --> 40:23.540
Can you sit down?

40:23.550 --> 40:26.430
Where's holly?

40:27.220 --> 40:29.820
Probably out celebrating
rebecca's new job.

40:29.840 --> 40:32.060
Ah, yeah. Well, I heard.

40:32.070 --> 40:35.750
So what, have you brought me
here to-- to commiserate with you?

40:35.760 --> 40:39.250
You're here to help me fix is.

40:39.260 --> 40:41.830
Holly doesn't respect
this company's history,

40:41.840 --> 40:45.040
she doesn't respect my
position, my experience, nothing.

40:45.050 --> 40:48.960
Right. So what's the problem,
tommy? You tried to make it work.

40:48.970 --> 40:52.590
Well, obviously I can'T.

40:52.600 --> 40:58.430
Look, I'm not gonna stand byand watch
her seize control while she shuts us out.

41:00.070 --> 41:03.400
My offer stands.

41:03.410 --> 41:05.980
I will help you get her out.

41:06.440 --> 41:08.300
Good.
