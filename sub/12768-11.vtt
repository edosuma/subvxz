♪ OHHH OHHH OHHH ♪

00:34.458 --> 00:37.041
CAN I GO TO SCHOOL NOW?

00:50.250 --> 00:53.291
(elevator bell dings)

01:09.083 --> 01:12.041
I'M VERY GOOD
AT ACCEPTING APOLOGIES, MARK.

01:12.083 --> 01:16.041
I APOLOGIZED
OVER THE PHONE.
"FINE. I'LL BRING HER
TO L.A." IS NOT AN APOLOGY.

01:16.083 --> 01:19.041
WH-WHAT IS THAT?
THAT'S JUST A SHADOW.
THAT'S THE BABY.

01:19.083 --> 01:21.458
WHERE'S THE A.T.M.?
A.V.M., SWEETHEART.

01:21.500 --> 01:25.083
A.T.M. IS WHERE
YOU GET MONEY.
YOU'RE NOT GONNA SEE
THE A.V.M. HERE.

01:25.125 --> 01:28.083
THAT'S JUST A CLUSTER
OF BLOOD VESSELS.
THAT AREN'T SUPPOSED
TO BE THERE,

01:28.125 --> 01:31.750
AND IF YOU POP THEM,
I'M GONNA DIE?
W--NO.
UM, SLOAN, IT'S JUST

01:31.792 --> 01:34.333
A TANGLED CLUSTER OF
BLOOD VESSELS UNDER THE BABY.

01:34.375 --> 01:36.291
I'M NOT GONNA GO
ANYWHERE NEAR THEM,

01:36.333 --> 01:38.667
SO I WON'T BE POPPING THEM.

01:38.709 --> 01:41.041
I'M GONNA GO IN,
UH, LAPAROSCOPICALLY

01:41.083 --> 01:44.917
AND VERY CAREFULLY CUT
ONE OF THE AMNIOTIC BANDS

01:44.959 --> 01:48.041
FROM AROUND THE BABY'S LEGS.
AND THEN HE'LL BE OKAY?
HE'LL BE ABLE TO WALK?

01:48.083 --> 01:50.208
THEN HE'LL BE PERFECT.
WELL, THAT'S WHAT
YOU SAID LAST TIME.

01:50.250 --> 01:52.709
THAT WAS MY FAULT, SLOAN.

01:52.750 --> 01:56.041
I SHOULDA LET HER FINISH
THE SURGERY THE FIRST TIME.
NOW THAT IS AN APOLOGY.

01:56.083 --> 01:58.500
WHAT IS THAT? WHAT IS
THAT THING RIGHT THERE?

01:58.542 --> 02:01.583
IS THAT SOMETHING GROWING
OUT OF HIS HEAD?
THAT IS A PENIS.

02:01.625 --> 02:04.041
SLOAN, YOU'RE GONNA MAKE
YOURSELF CRAZY

02:04.083 --> 02:06.041
TRYING TO READ THE ULTRASOUND.

02:06.083 --> 02:08.500
HAS HER BLOOD PRESSURE
ALWAYS BEEN THIS HIGH?

02:08.542 --> 02:11.000
YEAH, IT'S BEEN GOING UP.
SHE'S SCARED.

02:12.750 --> 02:14.333
SO AM I.

02:14.375 --> 02:22.542
(monitor beeps rhythmically)

02:22.583 --> 02:25.250
MARK SLOAN, PETE WILDER.
PETE WILDER, MARK SLOAN.

02:25.291 --> 02:27.166
HI, GOOD TO MEET YOU.
MM-HMM.

02:27.208 --> 02:29.875
AND THIS IS SLOAN,
MARK'S DAUGHTER.
SLOAN SLOAN?

02:29.917 --> 02:31.875
SLOAN RILEY.
SHE GOT HER MOM'S
LAST NAME.

02:31.917 --> 02:34.583
OH, OKAY. WELL, SLOAN,
DR. MONTGOMERY ASKED ME

02:34.625 --> 02:37.083
TO HELP YOU TRY
TO CALM DOWN A LITTLE.

02:37.125 --> 02:39.583
SHE SAYS YOU'RE NERVOUS
ABOUT YOUR SURGERY.
WHAT IS HE, A PHARMACIST?

02:39.625 --> 02:42.041
NO, ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE.
DUDE, YOU ARE NOT PUTTING
THOSE NEEDLES IN ME.

02:42.083 --> 02:45.291
MOST PEOPLE BARELY FEEL IT.
DUDE, YOU HEARD HER. YOU'RE NOT
PUTTING THOSE NEEDLES IN HER.

02:45.333 --> 02:48.000
DUDE...
PETE IS DOING ME A FAVOR.

02:48.041 --> 02:51.000
WITH RESPECT, I DIDN'T BRING
MY DAUGHTER DOWN HERE

02:51.041 --> 02:52.542
FOR WITCH DOCTORING.

02:52.583 --> 02:54.041
WITH RESPECT, REALLY?
MARK.

02:54.083 --> 02:56.166
WHAT KIND OF MEDICINE
DO YOU PRACTICE?
PLASTICS.

02:56.208 --> 02:58.750
(laughs)
WHAT ARE YOU LAUGHING AT?

02:58.792 --> 03:01.709
AH, NOTHING. SAVING THE WORLD
ONE BOOB JOB AT A TIME.

03:01.750 --> 03:05.041
HEY, LISTEN, PAL--
OKAY, OKAY. LOOK, ENOUGH. PETE,
YOU'RE GONNA DO YOUR THING.

03:05.083 --> 03:07.166
MARK, YOU'RE GONNA LET PETE
DO HIS THING.
NO, I'M NOT GONNA LET PETE--

03:07.208 --> 03:09.041
OH, YES, YOU ARE.
I'M IN CHARGE HERE.

03:09.083 --> 03:12.583
AND IF YOU WANT ME TO DO THIS
SURGERY AGAIN, THEN YOU'RE GONNA

03:12.625 --> 03:15.417
FOLLOW ME OUT OF THIS ROOM
RIGHT NOW. RIGHT NOW, MARK.

03:15.458 --> 03:17.250
RIGHT NOW. LET'S GO.

03:27.709 --> 03:30.000
HI, DR. COOPER.
HEY, CODY.

03:30.041 --> 03:32.417
IS YOUR MOM HOME?
OH, SHE RAN
TO THE POST OFFICE.

03:32.458 --> 03:35.041
SHE'LL BE HOME SOON.
COULD WE WAIT INSIDE?

03:35.083 --> 03:37.625
MY MOM'S A SUPER GOOD MOM.

03:37.667 --> 03:40.041
I KNOW.
SHE'S SUPER NICE.

03:40.083 --> 03:43.458
I KNOW. I'VE MET HER. YOU TRYING
TO FIX US UP OR SOMETHING?

03:43.500 --> 03:45.917
NO. I JUST...

03:45.959 --> 03:47.709
OKAY, COME IN.

03:56.875 --> 03:59.083
ALL RIGHT. FOLLOW ME.

03:59.125 --> 04:02.125
JUST BE CAREFUL YOU DON'T
KNOCK OVER ANY PILES.

04:10.834 --> 04:13.709
(saw whirs)

04:13.750 --> 04:17.208
SO, UH, YOUR MOM LIKES
TO HOLD ON TO STUFF, HUH?
SHE'S A SUPER GOOD MOM.

04:17.250 --> 04:20.291
I KNOW. YOU SAID THAT.
I WAS THINKING MAYBE

04:20.333 --> 04:24.041
ONE OF THE REASONS YOU WANTED ME
TO COME HERE WAS SO I COULD SEE

04:24.083 --> 04:26.041
HOW MUCH STUFF SHE KEEPS.
(woman) CODY.

04:26.083 --> 04:27.667
OH.

04:27.709 --> 04:30.875
OH, MY GOD. DR. FREEDMAN,
WHAT ARE Y--WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

04:30.917 --> 04:32.709
THE ITCHING
WAS KILLING ME, MOM.

04:32.750 --> 04:35.333
I WAS GONNA GO CRAZY.
CODY, I WOULD'VE TAKEN YOU
TO THE DOCTOR.

04:35.375 --> 04:37.542
I KNOW, BUT...
DR. FREEDMAN,

04:37.583 --> 04:41.041
I-I KNOW WHAT YOU
MUST BE THINKING.
NO, I'M THINKING THAT, UH,

04:41.083 --> 04:44.041
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO TAKE CODY
TO THE HOSPITAL.
WHAT? WHY?

04:44.083 --> 04:46.959
WELL, HE'S GOT A-A SKIN
INFECTION, A PRETTY BAD ONE.
OH, GOD.

04:47.000 --> 04:49.041
CODY, YOU CAN'T SCRATCH THAT,
OKAY?

04:49.083 --> 04:51.917
DO YOU WANT TO TAKE HIM IN
YOUR CAR, YOU CAN MEET ME THERE?
YEAH. YES, THANK YOU.

04:51.959 --> 04:53.291
MM-HMM.
THANKS SO MUCH.

04:53.333 --> 04:55.583
SEE YOU THERE.

04:55.625 --> 04:57.458
SHE'S CRAZY CAKES!
THAT'S YOUR DIAGNOSIS?

04:57.500 --> 05:00.542
CRAZY CAKES. THERE IS
BROKEN CRAP PILED EVERYWHERE.

05:00.583 --> 05:02.542
AND I'M NOT JUST
TALKING UNSANITARY.

05:02.583 --> 05:05.041
I AM TALKING INSANE.
OKAY. WELL, IT SOUNDS LIKE
SHE'S A HOARDER.

05:05.083 --> 05:07.500
THAT--THAT'S AN OBSESSIVE-
COMPULSIVE DISORDER, COOP.

05:07.542 --> 05:09.041
MAYBE IT'S GENETIC.

05:09.083 --> 05:11.709
MAYBE IT WAS TRIGGERED
BY A TRAUMA OR LOSS.

05:11.750 --> 05:14.542
OR WE COULD GO
WITH CRAZY CAKES. (laughs)
IF YOU HAD SEEN THIS PLACE,
YOU WOULD.

05:14.583 --> 05:16.125
OKAY. WELL, I WILL
TALK TO HER.

05:16.166 --> 05:18.750
IT'S ACTUALLY
A VERY HARD DISORDER TO TREAT.

05:18.792 --> 05:22.166
BUT, UH, I'LL DO THE BEST
I CAN. HOW'S THE KID?
THE KID IS SMART.
THE KID IS ARTICULATE.

05:22.208 --> 05:24.166
I HONESTLY THOUGHT MAYBE
HE HAD CALLED ME THERE

05:24.208 --> 05:26.750
AS A CRY FOR HELP SO I COULD
SEE THIS, BUT HE'S GOT

05:26.792 --> 05:29.083
WHAT I'M PRETTY SURE IS
A STAPH INFECTION ON HIS ARM,

05:29.125 --> 05:31.542
SO MAYBE HE JUST NEEDED
THAT CAST OFF.

05:31.583 --> 05:33.542
I'VE GOT HIM AT ST. AMBROSE
FOR THE ARM,

05:33.583 --> 05:36.291
AND HE IS STAYING THERE
UNTIL THAT HOUSE IS CLEAN.
WELL, THAT MIGHT TAKE
SOME TIME.

05:36.333 --> 05:38.125
OKAY, BUT IF IT TAKES
TOO MUCH TIME,

05:38.166 --> 05:41.583
I'M CALLING
CHILD PROTECTIVE SERVICES.
THANKS FOR THE VOTE
OF CONFIDENCE.

05:41.625 --> 05:44.917
HEY, COOP. HOW'S IT GOING
WITH CHARLOTTE?
I CAN'T FORGIVE HER.

05:44.959 --> 05:47.041
I'M TRYING, BUT I JUST...

05:47.083 --> 05:49.959
I CAN'T SEEM TO FORGIVE HER.

05:53.208 --> 05:55.834
WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH YOU?
ME? WHAT'S THE MATTER
WITH YOU?

05:55.875 --> 05:57.834
YOU'RE AS WOUND UP
AS I'VE EVER SEEN YOU.

05:57.875 --> 06:00.041
I AM NOT THE ONE

06:00.083 --> 06:02.959
STARTING SCHOOLYARD FIGHTS
WITH OTHER DOCTORS.
YOU'RE WOUND UP, ADDIE.
JUST ADMIT IT.

06:03.000 --> 06:05.041
BIZZY'S A LESBIAN.
WHAT?

06:05.083 --> 06:07.250
MY MOTHER--SHE'S A LESBIAN,

06:07.291 --> 06:09.250
WHICH MEANS THE CAPTAIN
WASN'T A CHEATER.

06:09.291 --> 06:11.250
IT WAS ALL A SHAM--
MY WHOLE CHILDHOOD.

06:11.291 --> 06:13.834
EVERYTHING I BELIEVED ABOUT
MY DAD, MY MOM, LOVE, MARRIAGE--

06:13.875 --> 06:15.834
IT'S ALL TURNED ON ITS HEAD.

06:15.875 --> 06:19.208
SO, YEAH, I'M A LITTLE...
WOUND UP.
WOW.

06:19.250 --> 06:21.417
YOUR TURN.

06:21.458 --> 06:23.041
LEXIE DUMPED ME.

06:23.083 --> 06:24.417
OH.

06:24.458 --> 06:27.041
I ASKED HER TO RAISE
SLOAN'S BABY WITH ME.

06:27.083 --> 06:29.583
OR, YOU KNOW, RAISE IT
WITH ME AND SLOAN.

06:29.625 --> 06:32.375
SHE'S A LITTLE YOUNG FOR THAT,
DON'T YOU THINK?
DO NOT TAKE HER SIDE.

06:32.417 --> 06:34.792
I'M SORRY.
IT SUCKS.

06:34.834 --> 06:36.083
(sighs) YEAH.

06:36.125 --> 06:39.041
YOUR THING SUCKS, TOO.

06:39.083 --> 06:40.500
BIZZY'S A LESBIAN?

06:40.542 --> 06:43.041
THANK YOU.

06:43.083 --> 06:44.417
(sighs)

06:47.291 --> 06:49.667
(exhales deeply)
WHEN DID WE GET SO--

06:49.709 --> 06:51.375
OLD?

06:51.417 --> 06:53.291
I WAS GONNA SAY SAD.

06:53.333 --> 06:55.792
WHEN DID WE GET SO SAD?

06:55.834 --> 06:56.917
(sighs)

06:56.959 --> 06:58.917
DON'T YOU WISH
WE DID HEROIN?

06:58.959 --> 07:01.959
ADDISON FORBES MONTGOMERY--
NO, NO, I MEAN,
DON'T YOU WISH WE DID DRUGS,

07:02.000 --> 07:05.041
DRANK TOO MUCH,
SHOT SOMETHING INTO OUR VEIN?

07:05.083 --> 07:08.041
I MEAN, NOTHING, YOU KNOW, THAT
WOULD MAKE YOU RUIN YOUR LIFE

07:08.083 --> 07:10.625
OR KILL YOU OR MAKE YOU
HAVE TO GO TO MEETINGS

07:10.667 --> 07:13.041
AND SAY, "HI, I'M ADDISON.
AND I'M AN ALCOHOLIC."

07:13.083 --> 07:14.417
BUT JUST... (sighs)

07:14.458 --> 07:15.875
(chuckles)

07:15.917 --> 07:17.875
YOU KNOW, NAI--SHE EATS.

07:17.917 --> 07:20.041
SHE PUTS FOOD ON TOP OF IT,

07:20.083 --> 07:22.500
AND THAT NUMBS THE PAIN,

07:22.542 --> 07:25.041
THE MALAISE,
THE--THE--THE SAD.

07:25.083 --> 07:28.041
I MEAN, SHE PUTS FOOD ON TOP
OF IT, AND SHE FEELS GOOD.

07:28.083 --> 07:30.083
BUT I... I DON'T...

07:30.125 --> 07:32.125
I HAVE GREEN JUICE.

07:32.166 --> 07:34.125
I MEAN,
THAT'S ALL I REALLY LIKE.

07:34.166 --> 07:37.250
AND GREEN JUICE, I CAN'T REALLY
PUT THAT ON TOP IF IT.

07:37.291 --> 07:40.083
I WANT TO PUT SOMETHING
ON TOP OF IT,

07:40.125 --> 07:41.583
BUT I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING.

07:41.625 --> 07:44.583
MARK, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
I'M TELLING YOU HOW I FEEL.

07:44.625 --> 07:47.875
AND I HEAR YOU.
NUMB THE PAIN.
WHAT--

07:47.917 --> 07:51.709
NUMB THE SAD. FEEL GOOD.
PUT SOMETHING ON TOP OF IT.

07:51.750 --> 07:54.041
MARK, I SAID PUT SOMETHING
ON TOP OF IT,

07:54.083 --> 07:56.667
NOT PUT YOU ON TOP OF ME.

07:56.709 --> 08:00.959
MY LIFE IS IN RUINS.
IT'S A MESS.

08:01.000 --> 08:04.041
I'M ABOUT TO BE
A GRANDFATHER,

08:04.083 --> 08:05.709
AND I'M ALONE.

08:05.750 --> 08:09.542
I DON'T KNOW OF A LOT
OF SUREFIRE WAYS

08:09.583 --> 08:11.750
TO NUMB THE PAIN,

08:11.792 --> 08:13.417
BUT I DO KNOW ONE.

08:13.458 --> 08:15.417
NOW... DO YOU WANT
TO FEEL BETTER

08:15.458 --> 08:17.542
OR DON'T YOU?

(laughs)
WHEN YOU DATE CHILDREN.

09:10.792 --> 09:13.041
YOU FORGET WHAT IT'S LIKE...
(whispers) TO BE WITH A WOMAN.
HEY.

09:13.083 --> 09:15.041
(smacks buttocks)
(normal voice) OH!

09:15.083 --> 09:17.041
NO BEING MEAN ABOUT LEXIE.
(laughs)

09:17.083 --> 09:18.583
DID YOU JUST SPANK ME?

09:18.625 --> 09:21.291
OH, WHAT, WHAT, YOU WANT
TO START SOMETHING?
MAYBE.

09:21.333 --> 09:23.709
COME ON. BRING IT, SISTER.
I WILL, RIGHT NOW, DR. SLOAN.

09:23.750 --> 09:25.500
OH, I'LL GIVE YOU
MORE OF THE SAME.

09:25.542 --> 09:27.583
(smacks buttocks)
REALLY? OH! MY GOD. (laughs)

09:27.625 --> 09:29.709
ADDI--AAH.
OH!

09:29.750 --> 09:32.041
SAM, CLOSE THE DOOR!
ADDISON, THIS IS
A PLACE OF BUSINESS.

09:32.083 --> 09:35.709
UH, SAM, WILL YOU, UH, JUST
TOSS ME THAT SHIRT THERE, BUDDY?

09:37.750 --> 09:40.041
SAM, CLOSE THE DOOR.

09:40.083 --> 09:43.041
HEY.
OH, MY GOD.

09:43.083 --> 09:45.500
SLOAN SLOAN WENT RIGHT TO SLEEP.
THE NEEDLES WORKED WONDERS.

09:45.542 --> 09:47.041
THANKS. GREAT JOB, DUDE.

09:47.083 --> 09:48.959
OKAY, THEN.

09:49.000 --> 09:51.041
TOO BAD I JOINED
THE OTHER PRACTICE.

09:51.083 --> 09:53.625
THIS PLACE HAS PERKS.

09:53.667 --> 09:56.000
(lowered voice)
SAM, CLOSE THE DOOR!

09:58.125 --> 09:59.875
I KEEP EVERYTHING OF CODY'S

09:59.917 --> 10:01.875
BECAUSE HE MIGHT WANT IT
SOMEDAY.

10:01.917 --> 10:03.625
REPORT CARDS, TROPHIES.

10:03.667 --> 10:05.625
MM-HMM. YEAH, AND THERE'S
OTHER STUFF THAT,

10:05.667 --> 10:08.041
YOU KNOW, NEEDS TO BE DONATED
TO GOODWILL OR SOMEWHERE.

10:08.083 --> 10:10.041
HAVE YOU CALLED ANYBODY
ABOUT COMING TO PICK IT UP?

10:10.083 --> 10:13.458
YOU KNOW WHAT? I HAVEN'T
GONE THROUGH ALL OF IT JUST YET.
DO YOU NEED HELP
DOING THAT?

10:13.500 --> 10:17.041
I KNOW HOW OVERWHELMING IT COULD
BE TO BE A SINGLE PARENT.

10:17.083 --> 10:19.333
WELL, IT WAS EASIER
WHEN HIS DAD WAS ALIVE,

10:19.375 --> 10:22.000
BUT CODY AND I ARE, UH,
WE'RE OKAY NOW. WE DO FINE.

10:22.041 --> 10:25.041
WHEN DID HE DIE?

10:25.083 --> 10:26.917
THREE YEARS AGO.

10:26.959 --> 10:29.000
I'M SORRY. WHAT HAPPENED?

10:29.041 --> 10:31.333
I KNOW THAT YOU WANT TO HELP,

10:31.375 --> 10:34.083
BUT HONESTLY, I DON'T NEED...
ANY HELP.

10:34.125 --> 10:38.250
CODY AND I ARE JUST FINE.

10:38.291 --> 10:40.417
(clears throat)

10:43.834 --> 10:46.542
YOU GET 30 SECONDS.
I'M SORRY?

10:46.583 --> 10:49.041
WE ARE BUSINESS PARTNERS,
SO YOU GET 30 SECONDS

10:49.083 --> 10:51.083
TO LECTURE ME
ON MY BUSINESS PRACTICES.

10:51.125 --> 10:53.500
BUT IF YOU START TO LECTURE ME
ON SOMETHING NOT RELATED

10:53.542 --> 10:57.000
TO MY BUSINESS PRACTICES, I WILL
WALK AWAY. THOSE ARE THE RULES.

10:57.041 --> 10:59.834
OH, SO OUR FRIENDSHIP
HAS RULES NOW?
NO. WE'RE NOT TALKING
AS FRIENDS RIGHT NOW.

10:59.875 --> 11:02.041
WE'RE TALKING
AS BUSINESS PARTNERS.
WELL, I WANT TO TALK
TO MY FRIEND.

11:02.083 --> 11:05.208
SHE DOESN'T WANT TO TALK
TO YOU RIGHT NOW.
SO NOW YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT
YOURSELF IN THIRD PERSON.

11:05.250 --> 11:07.959
HI. DID YOU SLEEP
WITH MARK SLOAN

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
ON THE FLOOR OF YOUR OFFICE?
YEP.

11:10.041 --> 11:11.834
SAM--
AND SHE'S MAKING UP RULES

11:11.875 --> 11:14.208
AND SHE'S TALKING ABOUT HERSELF
IN THIRD PERSON.
YES, I AM, BECAUSE I HAVE

11:14.250 --> 11:17.208
EARNED THAT RIGHT.
WHEN YOU HAVE GONE THROUGH

11:17.250 --> 11:19.625
WHAT I'VE GONE THROUGH WITH
MY FAMILY, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT

11:19.667 --> 11:22.375
TO BE A LITTLE ECCENTRIC
FOR A FEW WEEKS.

11:22.417 --> 11:24.166
YOU HAVE THE RIGHT
TO REFER TO YOURSELF

11:24.208 --> 11:27.208
IN THE THIRD PERSON AND HAVE SEX
ON THE FLOOR OF YOUR OFFICE

11:27.250 --> 11:30.375
AND APPLY RANDOM RULES TO OLD
FRIENDSHIPS. YOU HAVE THE RIGHT.
(pounds on countertop)

11:30.417 --> 11:32.875
(pounds on countertop)
OKAY. ALL RIGHT, SAM.
YOU NEED TO LEAVE ADDISON ALONE

11:32.917 --> 11:34.792
BECAUSE YOU'RE
MAKING HER SCREAM.

11:34.834 --> 11:37.417
ADDISON, I AM HERE FOR YOU
IF YOU NEED ME.

11:37.458 --> 11:40.625
YOU SEE THAT?
THAT IS A FRIEND.
OKAY. (scoffs)

11:40.667 --> 11:43.834
OKAY, YOU CAME TO ME AND YOU
WERE UPSET, YOU WERE SCARED,

11:43.875 --> 11:46.250
YOU WERE A LITTLE DESPERATE,
AND I TURNED YOU DOWN.

11:46.291 --> 11:48.792
NOW I TURNED YOU DOWN
BECAUSE I AM A GOOD PERSON.

11:48.834 --> 11:51.667
MARK SLOAN HAD YOU NAKED WITHIN
AN HOUR OF HIS ARRIVAL.

11:51.709 --> 11:54.041
NOW WHAT DOES THAT
SAY TO YOU?

11:54.083 --> 11:58.041
ADDISON.
YOU BROKE THE RULES.
I'M WALKING AWAY.

11:58.083 --> 12:01.041
(indistinct conversations)

12:05.458 --> 12:07.792
RELATIVE HARMONY?

12:07.834 --> 12:11.625
WELL, AS LONG AS BETSEY'S
NOT WITH ME, SHE SEEMS FINE.

12:11.667 --> 12:13.041
SHE'LL COME AROUND.

12:13.083 --> 12:14.625
SHE HATES ME.

12:14.667 --> 12:17.917
MAYA HATES ME
FOR NO DISCERNIBLE REASON.

12:17.959 --> 12:19.917

TAKE IT PERSONALLY.

12:19.959 --> 12:21.917

12:23.959 --> 12:25.917
I'M NOT THE ONE

12:25.959 --> 12:27.917
AND I LOST SOMEONE, TOO.

12:27.959 --> 12:30.083
I WENT THROUGH
A TRAUMA, TOO.

12:30.125 --> 12:31.709
DELL, SHE'S 7.

12:31.750 --> 12:33.500

12:33.542 --> 12:35.333
SHE'S 7.

12:35.375 --> 12:37.750
I KNOW.

12:37.792 --> 12:39.750
HOARDING IS A MENTAL ILLNESS,
COOPER.

12:39.792 --> 12:42.750
I CAN'T JUST TELL HER
TO SNAP OUT OF IT.
NO, BUT YOU CAN GET
A DUMP TRUCK,

12:42.792 --> 12:46.417
BACK IT UP
AND START SHOVELING.
THEN SHE'S JUST GONNA START WITH
THE BEHAVIOR ALL OVER AGAIN.

12:46.458 --> 12:50.041
I NEED SOME TIME TO GET
TO THE ROOT OF THE PROBLEM.
HE DOESN'T HAVE TIME.
HE'S GOT STAPH EATING HIS ARM.

A CLEAN HOUSE. YOU KNOW THAT.

12:52.917 --> 12:55.125
AND YOU'RE TREATING IT
AT ST. AMBROSE.
YEAH, AND CHARLOTTE'S
GONNA SLICE ME

12:55.166 --> 12:57.250
FOR USING ONE OF HER
PRECIOUS BEDS FOR SOMEONE

12:57.291 --> 13:00.041
THAT'S NOT

DO YOU HAVE ANY FAMILY

ANY AUNTS, UNCLES?

WELL, I'M WORKING WITH YOUR MOM

17:36.625 --> 17:39.000
AND IT'D BE BETTER

17:39.041 --> 17:42.792
IF YOU HAD SOMEPLACE ELSE
TO STAY FOR A WHILE.
NO, I NEED TO BE WITH HER.
I TAKE CARE OF HER.

17:42.834 --> 17:45.583
WELL, WOULD YOU LIKE THAT
TO BE DIFFERENT?

17:45.625 --> 17:47.875
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

17:47.917 --> 17:50.375
SH-SHE NEEDS HELP, CODY.

17:50.417 --> 17:53.041
SHE NEEDS MORE HELP
THAN YOU CAN GIVE HER.

17:53.083 --> 17:55.875
AND THIS SEPARATION
WOULD ONLY BE TEMPORARY.

17:55.917 --> 17:59.250
YOU CAN'T DO THAT.
SHE'D BE...

17:59.291 --> 18:03.375
IT'D BE LIKE WHEN MY DAD
AND MY SISTER DIED.

18:03.417 --> 18:06.000
DO YOU MIND
IF I ASK YOU ABOUT THAT?

18:10.291 --> 18:12.125
MY DAD HAD US WEEKENDS.

18:12.166 --> 18:14.458
SO THEY WERE DIVORCED?

18:14.500 --> 18:18.041

JUST MY SISTER THAT FRIDAY.

18:29.166 --> 18:31.959

OR CHOCOLATE,

ALL ABOUT PLEASING YOU,

18:39.083 --> 18:41.041

18:41.083 --> 18:43.125

YOU CAN IGNORE THEM,

18:43.166 --> 18:45.875
YOU CAN WALK ALL OVER THEM,

18:45.917 --> 18:49.041
BUT STILL, MAKING YOU HAPPY
IS THEIR FIRST THOUGHT.
SNIPPING THE FIRST BAND.

18:49.083 --> 18:51.041

18:51.083 --> 18:53.667

HECK, EVEN A SCHNAUZER.

SLOAN IS A DACHSHUND.

OTHER DOGS' POOP.

19:01.917 --> 19:03.875

19:03.917 --> 19:06.458
THAN THEY ARE
WITH MAKING YOU HAPPY.

19:06.500 --> 19:09.500
THEY'RE FILTHY AND IMMORAL--
IMMORAL?
THEY'RE IMMORAL DOGS?

19:09.542 --> 19:11.875

ARE DESPERATE--

19:11.917 --> 19:13.500
DESPERATE FOR AFFECTION.

19:13.542 --> 19:16.041
BUT IT'S THE WRONG KIND
OF AFFECTION,

19:16.083 --> 19:18.917

ALWAYS TAKE CARE OF THEM.

I THINK HE'S GONNA BE FINE.

19:55.917 --> 19:58.667
YOU THINK?
I HOPE. I'M SORRY. THE A.V.M.
IS VERY DELICATE, MARK.

19:58.709 --> 20:00.542
IT'S DIRECTLY BELOW
THE DISSECTION,

20:00.583 --> 20:03.959
AND IT--IT--IT--
IT JUST BLEW.
I NEED TO SEE HER.

20:04.000 --> 20:06.458
OKAY, LOOK, MARK, SHE'S GONNA BE
IN BAD SHAPE WHEN SHE WAKES UP.

20:06.500 --> 20:08.750
SHE HEMORRHAGED.
I HAD TO OPEN HER UP.

20:08.792 --> 20:10.750
SHE'S GONNA BE MUCH WORSE
THAN LAST TIME.

20:10.792 --> 20:13.166
THE LAST THING SHE NEEDS
IS TO LOOK UP

20:13.208 --> 20:15.875
AND SEE YOU HOVERING,
TERRIFIED.
WHAT DO YOU EXPECT ME TO DO?

20:15.917 --> 20:19.000
WHY DON'T WE JUST TAKE A WALK?
WE CAN JUST CALM--
NAOMI, DON'T TALK TO ME LIKE
I'M A CHILD. I'M NOT A 12 YEAR--

20:19.041 --> 20:21.041
MARK, PLEASE,
JUST GO WITH NAOMI.

20:21.083 --> 20:23.709
SHE KNOWS
WHAT SHE'S TALKING ABOUT.
FIX THIS.

20:29.083 --> 20:31.083
THAT BABY HAS TO BE OKAY.

20:31.125 --> 20:33.875
HE WILL. HE WILL.

20:35.208 --> 20:37.166
I CARE ABOUT MARK SLOAN.

20:37.208 --> 20:39.709
I LOVED HIM ONCE.
AND HE WAS OUR BEST FRIEND.

20:39.750 --> 20:41.709
AND, YES, HE'S DONE
A LOT OF STUPID THINGS,

20:41.750 --> 20:44.709
BUT HE ALSO LET ALL OF US
DO A LOT OF STUPID THINGS.

20:44.750 --> 20:47.041
HE LET US DO
A LOT OF STUPID THINGS

20:47.083 --> 20:48.792
AND HE NEVER JUDGED US.

20:48.834 --> 20:51.166
HE'S NOT JUST A DOG, SAM.

20:51.208 --> 20:56.041
SURE, HE'S GOT A SCREWED UP
MORAL COMPASS, BUT SO DO I.

20:56.083 --> 20:58.208
HE'S A GOOD MAN.

20:58.250 --> 21:02.375
(exhales)
THIS BABY'S GOTTA BE OKAY.

21:06.083 --> 21:08.041
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
HE HAD A SISTER.

21:08.083 --> 21:11.041
YEAH, AND THE FACT THAT SHE
DIDN'T EVEN MENTION IT...
YEAH.

21:11.083 --> 21:13.500
IT HAS TO BE THE ROOT
OF THE PROBLEM.

21:13.542 --> 21:16.000
HEY, WHERE'S CODY?
HIS MOTHER TOOK HIM HOME.

21:17.667 --> 21:19.875
I'M CALLING D.C.F.S.
D.C.F.S. IS NOT
THE ANSWER--

21:19.917 --> 21:22.208
SHE SNATCHED CODY OUT OF
THE HOSPITAL

21:22.250 --> 21:24.959
AND BROUGHT HIM BACK
TO THE HOUSE OF HORRORS!
WHY ARE YOU SHOUTING AT ME?

21:25.000 --> 21:27.125
BECAUSE YOU HAVE NO CONCERN
AT ALL FOR THIS BOY.
THE BEST THING FOR THAT CHILD

21:27.166 --> 21:30.000
WOULD BE TO HAVE A HEALTHY
MOTHER, AND FRANKLY,

21:30.041 --> 21:32.500
THE BEST THING FOR YOU WOULD BE
TO STOP DISPLACING YOUR ANGER.
WHAT IS THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

21:32.542 --> 21:34.375
YOU'RE ANGRY AT CHARLOTTE.
YOU'RE ANGRY AT YOURSELF.

21:34.417 --> 21:36.333
YOU KEEP LASHING OUT
AT EVERYBODY ELSE

21:36.375 --> 21:38.333
SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO TAKE
RESPONSIBILITY.

21:38.375 --> 21:40.750
I AM TRYING TO HELP CODY.
BY PUTTING HIM
IN FOSTER CARE?

21:40.792 --> 21:42.750
BY RIPPING HIM
AWAY FROM HIS MOTHER?

21:42.792 --> 21:44.875
BY BREAKING HIS HEART?
GET A GRIP, COOPER.

21:44.917 --> 21:48.041
DEAL WITH YOUR PROBLEMS.
WHY DO YOU THINK
CHARLOTTE LIED TO ME?

21:48.083 --> 21:50.458
NO, NO, COOPER. YOU GOTTA
TALK TO HER ABOUT THAT.

21:50.500 --> 21:52.041
I'M SERIOUS. I AM OUT.

21:52.083 --> 21:53.667
OH, YOU'RE OUT? YOU'RE OUT.

21:53.709 --> 21:55.667
YOU DON'T GET TO BE OUT!

21:55.709 --> 21:58.667
HOW MANY TIMES--HOW MANY TIMES
HAVE I HAD TO LISTEN TO YOU

21:58.709 --> 22:01.250
GO ON AND ON AND ON
ABOUT ALLAN

22:01.291 --> 22:03.583
OR SHELDON
OR, OH, MY GOD, PETE?

22:03.625 --> 22:05.917
PETE THIS AND PETE THAT,
VIOLET.

22:05.959 --> 22:07.917
AND LOOK HOW WELL
THAT WORKED OUT.

22:07.959 --> 22:11.625
LOOK HOW HEALTHY I AM.
YAY ME. I AM SUPER NORMAL.

22:11.667 --> 22:13.834
POINT TAKEN.
THANK YOU.

22:13.875 --> 22:16.834
TALK TO HER... NOT ME.

22:16.875 --> 22:18.208
WORK IT OUT OR NOT.

22:18.250 --> 22:21.375
YOU LOVE EACH OTHER,
YOU DON'T--FIGURE IT OUT...

22:21.417 --> 22:24.083
WITH CHARLOTTE.

22:24.125 --> 22:27.625
I'M CALLING D.C.F.S.

22:32.208 --> 22:36.500
IS THERE SOME REASON WHY WE ARE
EATING IN SILENCE YET AGAIN?

22:36.542 --> 22:38.542
MAY I BE EXCUSED?

22:38.583 --> 22:41.125
MAYA, WHY DON'T YOU JUST
TELL ME WHAT'S GOING ON?

22:41.166 --> 22:44.041
WE CAN TALK ABOUT IT.

22:44.083 --> 22:47.542
CAN I BE EXCUSED, TOO?
BETSEY, NAOMI WENT TO
A LOT OF TROUBLE--

22:47.583 --> 22:50.542
THANK YOU FOR BREAKFAST.
MAY I BE EXCUSED?

22:50.583 --> 22:52.667
SURE, HONEY.

22:52.709 --> 22:55.000
YEAH.

22:57.083 --> 22:59.959
WELL, AT LEAST YOU KNOW WHY
YOURS ISN'T SPEAKING TO YOU.

23:00.000 --> 23:02.041
I DIDN'T KILL HER MOTHER,
YOU KNOW?

23:02.083 --> 23:03.792
I'M JUST GONNA SAY IT
TO HER, YOU KNOW,

23:03.834 --> 23:06.542
'CAUSE AT SOME POINT,
YOU GOTTA GROW UP.
DELL, SHE'S--

23:06.583 --> 23:08.792
I KNOW SHE'S 7. I-I KNOW.

23:08.834 --> 23:11.000
BUT I-I CAN'T
FEEL LIKE THIS EVERY DAY.

23:11.041 --> 23:14.208
YOU KNOW, I CAN'T KEEP BEING
TREATED LIKE THE ENEMY.
WELL, MAYBE ALL SHE NEEDS
IS AN APOLOGY.

23:14.250 --> 23:16.667
WHAT AM I APOLOGIZING FOR?
I DID THE RIGHT THING.

23:16.709 --> 23:18.083
HEATHER'S FACED
WAS BURNED OFF.

23:18.125 --> 23:20.458
YOU KNOW, SHE BURNED
HER FACE OFF GETTING HIGH.

23:20.500 --> 23:23.458
YOU REALLY THINK I SHOULD'VE
LET BETSEY INTO THAT ROOM?
OKAY, YOU'RE IN MOURNING,

23:23.500 --> 23:26.000
AND, UH, YOU ARE MY FRIEND,
AND YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH HELL,

23:26.041 --> 23:28.000
SO I'VE BEEN
REALLY GENTLE WITH YOU.

23:28.041 --> 23:30.792
BUT I THINK I AM NOT GONNA BE
GENTLE WITH YOU ANYMORE.

23:30.834 --> 23:32.792
I THINK I'M JUST GONNA
TELL YOU THE TRUTH

23:32.834 --> 23:35.166
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT I WOULD
WANT YOU TO DO FOR ME.

23:35.208 --> 23:38.000
ARE YOU OKAY WITH THAT,
IF I'M NOT GENTLE ANYMORE?

23:38.041 --> 23:40.041
YES.
OKAY.

23:40.083 --> 23:42.041
I THINK YOU SHOULD'VE
LET HER IN THAT ROOM.

23:42.083 --> 23:44.875
I THINK YOU SHOULD'VE LET HER
SAY GOOD-BYE TO HER MOTHER.

23:44.917 --> 23:47.875
I THINK PETE WAS RIGHT, AND I
THINK YOU OWE HIM AN APOLOGY.

23:47.917 --> 23:50.834
AND I THINK THAT BETSEY
HAS A RIGHT TO BE PISSED.

23:50.875 --> 23:52.333
I WOULD BE PISSED, TOO.

23:52.375 --> 23:55.667
7 OR 37, I WOULD BE PISSED.

23:57.709 --> 23:59.083
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

23:59.125 --> 24:00.417
MOM?

24:00.458 --> 24:02.959
HEY, SLOAN. IT'S ADDISON.

24:03.000 --> 24:05.083
WHERE AM I?

24:05.125 --> 24:08.041
YOU'RE IN THE HOSPITAL
IN LOS ANGELES.

24:08.083 --> 24:11.333
YOU JUST HAD SURGERY,
BUT EVERYTHING IS FINE.

24:11.375 --> 24:14.875
YOU AND THE BABY ARE FINE.
WHERE'S MY MOM?
(cries) I WANT MY MOM.

24:14.917 --> 24:17.333
WELL, MARK'S HERE.
YOUR DAD'S HERE.

24:17.375 --> 24:22.125
AND HE'S GONNA BE HERE
IN JUST A FEW MINUTES.
I DON'T WANT HIM.
I WANT MY MOMMY.

24:22.166 --> 24:26.375
(crying) I DON'T WANT ANY
OF THIS. I DON'T WANT A BABY.

24:26.417 --> 24:29.375
I JUST WANT TO GO HOME.
I WANT MY LIFE BACK.

24:29.417 --> 24:32.250
I WANT TO GO HOME.

24:34.417 --> 24:36.792
I'M DELIRIOUS.

24:36.834 --> 24:38.792
I AM DELIRIOUS
WITH EXHAUSTION.
MM.

24:38.834 --> 24:40.792
LUCAS THOUGHT IT WAS MORNING
AT 2:00 A.M.

24:40.834 --> 24:43.041
AND THEN AGAIN AT 3:00 A.M.
AND AT 4:00,

24:43.083 --> 24:45.041
AND I'M--I FEEL LIKE
I'M UNDERWATER.

24:45.083 --> 24:47.041
SEE? THAT'S WHAT
I'M TALKING ABOUT.

24:47.083 --> 24:49.083
YOU'RE A GROWN MAN,
AND YOU'RE A WRECK.

24:49.125 --> 24:52.083
THAT'S WHAT YOU WERE
TALKING ABOUT TO WHO?
TO MYSELF...

24:52.125 --> 24:54.542
(laughs)
IN MY HEAD.

24:54.583 --> 24:57.083
SLOAN SLOAN--SHE'S...

24:57.125 --> 24:59.083
SHE'S PRETTY SIMPLE,
YOU KNOW, AND YOUNG.

24:59.125 --> 25:01.709
AND HER MOM HAD HER
WHEN SHE WAS YOUNG.

25:01.750 --> 25:04.959
AND I DON'T THINK SHE'S
EVEN THOUGHT ABOUT ADOPTION.

25:05.000 --> 25:06.959
I DON'T THINK ANYBODY'S
COUNSELED HER.

25:07.000 --> 25:08.959
AND I THINK SHE FEELS TRAPPED,

25:09.000 --> 25:10.959
AND I THINK IT'S
MY RESPONSIBILITY AS HER DOCTOR

25:11.000 --> 25:14.083
TO GIVE HER HER OPTIONS.
WELL, OF COURSE IT IS.
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

25:14.125 --> 25:16.083
MARK. HE REALLY...
WANTS THIS BABY.

25:16.125 --> 25:18.083
HE WANTS
TO RAISE IT WITH HER.

25:18.125 --> 25:20.542
ARE WE TALKING ABOUT
THE PLASTIC SURGEON?

25:20.583 --> 25:23.542
(laughs) OH, THE CONTEMPT

25:23.583 --> 25:26.166
THAT SEEPS
FROM YOUR EVERY WORD--

25:26.208 --> 25:29.792
DO YOU HAVE THAT FOR
EVERY PLASTIC SURGEON OR JUST,

25:29.834 --> 25:32.792
YOU KNOW, ONES THAT I SLEEP WITH
ON THE FLOOR OF MY OFFICE?
(laughs) I JUST--

25:32.834 --> 25:34.792
I DON'T THINK THERE'S
ANYTHING TO DEBATE, ADDISON.

25:34.834 --> 25:36.792
YOU'RE HER DOCTOR,
SHE'S A KID--
SHE'S 18.

25:36.834 --> 25:38.792
YEAH, WELL, STILL,
IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY

25:38.834 --> 25:41.583
TO COUNSEL HER,
GIVE HER THE OPTIONS.

25:41.625 --> 25:44.000
YEAH.

25:44.041 --> 25:47.000
BACK IN NEW YORK, YOU KNOW,
MARK AND I WERE TOGETHER,

25:47.041 --> 25:50.041
AND, UM...
I GOT PREGNANT.

25:50.083 --> 25:53.166
AND I TOLD HIM ABOUT IT,
AND HE WAS EXCITED,

25:53.208 --> 25:56.792
AND... I... WASN'T,

25:56.834 --> 25:58.375
AND I HAD AN ABORTION.

25:58.417 --> 26:00.458
I DIDN'T TALK TO HIM
ABOUT IT FIRST.

26:00.500 --> 26:04.041
I MADE THE DECISION
FOR BOTH OF US.

26:04.083 --> 26:05.458
AND HE WANTED IT.

26:05.500 --> 26:07.667
AND HE WANTS THIS ONE.

26:10.417 --> 26:12.000
(sighs)

26:12.041 --> 26:15.041
ONE THING
CAN'T INFORM THE OTHER.

26:15.083 --> 26:18.500
YOUR LOYALTY TO YOUR FRIEND
AND YOUR--YOUR GUILT

26:18.542 --> 26:21.250
OR YOUR REMORSE, IT CAN'T
INFORM YOUR PATIENT CARE.

26:21.291 --> 26:24.250
YOU GOTTA GIVE HER THE OPTIONS
AND LET HER CHOOSE.

26:24.291 --> 26:26.875
MAYBE IT'LL GO HIS WAY.

26:26.917 --> 26:28.917
AND I'M SORRY.

26:28.959 --> 26:31.667
IT SOUNDS JUST AWFUL.

26:31.709 --> 26:33.709
(sighs) THANKS.

26:38.667 --> 26:41.333
DON'T FALL ASLEEP ON MY HEAD.
I'M UP. I'M UP.

26:41.375 --> 26:43.875
(knock on door)

26:43.917 --> 26:45.750
HOW'S THE BABY?

26:45.792 --> 26:48.041
HEARTBEAT'S HOLDING STRONG.

26:48.083 --> 26:50.458
(sighs) I HAVEN'T
TAKEN MY EYES OFF IT.

26:50.500 --> 26:51.667
GOOD.

26:51.709 --> 26:53.834
THAT'S, UH...

26:53.875 --> 26:56.250
THAT'S GOOD.

26:56.291 --> 26:58.625
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

26:58.667 --> 26:59.959
WHAT?

27:00.000 --> 27:03.041
THIS MIDLIFE CRISIS,
UH, YOU'RE HAVING,

27:03.083 --> 27:05.041
ALL THIS TALK ABOUT
MOVING TO L.A.--

27:05.083 --> 27:07.917
WHATEVER IS--IS GOING ON
WITH YOU,

27:07.959 --> 27:09.917
SOMETHING WORSE IS GOING ON
WITH ADDISON.

27:09.959 --> 27:13.709
AND I'M NOT ABOUT TO LET HER
BE YOUR LANDING PAD.

27:13.750 --> 27:16.166
WHAT THE HELL
DO YOU CARE, SAM?

27:16.208 --> 27:18.792
WELL, SHE--SHE JUST SPENDS
A LOT OF TIME, UH,

27:18.834 --> 27:21.083
TRYING TO TAKE CARE OF
EVERYONE AT THE PRACTICE,

27:21.125 --> 27:23.709
SO, YOU KNOW, I'M TRYING
TO TAKE CARE OF HER.

27:23.750 --> 27:25.709
I'M SAYING, I LIKE YOU, MARK,

27:25.750 --> 27:28.500
BUT WHAT YOU'VE BEEN DOING
AROUND HERE,

27:28.542 --> 27:31.041
IT'S NOT YOU AT YOUR BEST.

27:31.083 --> 27:34.041
AND I ASK AGAIN,
WHAT THE HELL DO YOU CARE?

27:34.083 --> 27:36.125
I JUST CARE.

27:42.583 --> 27:44.291
HEY.

27:44.333 --> 27:45.917
LOOKING FOR ME?

27:45.959 --> 27:48.959
YEAH. I WANTED TO LET YOU KNOW
I HAVE A STAFF MEETING TONIGHT.

27:49.000 --> 27:51.041
I'M NOT SURE
WHEN I'M GONNA BE HOME.

27:51.083 --> 27:53.333
(exhales) YOU LIED.

27:53.375 --> 27:56.125
WHY DID YOU LIE?
I JUST WANT TO KNOW WHY.

27:56.166 --> 28:00.208
I TOLD YOU WHY.
NO, Y-YOU TOLD ME THAT THERE
ARE THINGS YOU CAN'T T--

28:00.250 --> 28:04.166
I TOLD YOU I DIDN'T WANT
TO GO THERE.
WERE YOU EVER GONNA MARRY ME?
WAS THAT A LIE, TOO?

28:07.083 --> 28:10.542
OH, I CANNOT BELIEVE YOU HAVE
THE NERVE TO DO THIS HERE.
WHAT?

28:10.583 --> 28:14.000
CAN YOU ANSWER THE QUESTION?
CAN YOU NOT ASK IT?
I HAVE ANSWERED IT?!

28:21.625 --> 28:23.792
YOU, UH,
YOU SEEN ADDISON?

28:23.834 --> 28:26.375
NO, NOT RECENTLY.
NOT DOWN HERE.

28:26.417 --> 28:28.000
OH.

28:29.417 --> 28:31.667
YOUR SON?

28:31.709 --> 28:32.792
YEAH.

28:32.834 --> 28:34.792
AND YOU BRING HIM
TO WORK?

28:34.834 --> 28:38.041
NAOMI IS COOL WITH THAT?

28:38.083 --> 28:41.166
I'M SORRY. I, UH,
I'M ABOUT TO HAVE A KID.

28:41.208 --> 28:44.166
OR MY KID--MY KID
IS ABOUT TO HAVE A KID.

28:44.208 --> 28:46.208
AND, UH, YOU CAN SKIP
THE GRANDPA JOKES,

28:46.250 --> 28:49.166
BECAUSE THEY HAVE
ALL BEEN MADE.

28:49.208 --> 28:50.875
ANYWAY...

28:50.917 --> 28:55.041
MY KID, SHE'S, UH...
SHE'S YOUNG.

28:55.083 --> 28:57.375
SHE'S GONNA NEED
A LOT OF HELP.

28:57.417 --> 29:00.041
SO I THINK IT'S REALLY GREAT

29:00.083 --> 29:03.583
THAT YOU GET TO BRING
YOUR BABY TO WORK.

29:03.625 --> 29:05.583
L.A.'s
A PRETTY LIBERAL PLACE.

29:05.625 --> 29:07.583
NAOMI'S
A PRETTY LIBERAL BOSS.

29:07.625 --> 29:11.208
YOU KNOW, I DON'T THINK
I'VE EVER EVEN HELD A BABY.

29:11.250 --> 29:13.041
I MEAN, OBVIOUSLY,
I HELD LOTS OF KIDS

29:13.083 --> 29:15.041
DURING MY PEDS ROTATION
WHEN I WAS A RESIDENT.

29:15.083 --> 29:16.834
BUT I DON'T--I DON'T...

29:16.875 --> 29:19.834
I DON'T THINK I'VE EVER
EVEN HELD A BABY.

29:25.500 --> 29:28.333
HERE.

29:28.375 --> 29:30.625
GO AHEAD.

29:30.667 --> 29:32.041
OKAY.

29:32.083 --> 29:35.083
JUST BE GENTLE.
I JUST GOT HIM QUIET.

29:38.917 --> 29:41.500
HI.

29:41.542 --> 29:43.917
OOH.

29:43.959 --> 29:46.417
HELLO.

29:46.458 --> 29:49.917
WOW, YOU'RE CUTE.

29:49.959 --> 29:51.250
(sighs)

29:51.291 --> 29:55.583
SHH. IT'S OKAY.

29:55.625 --> 29:58.542
(Lucas coos)

29:58.583 --> 30:01.458
SO HAVE I GOT THIS STRAIGHT?

30:01.500 --> 30:03.458
YOU THINK MY FAVORITE HOBBY
IS SITTING AROUND

30:03.500 --> 30:06.166
DREAMING UP WAYS
TO EMASCULATE YOU?
YOU HUMILIATED ME

30:06.208 --> 30:08.792
WHEN YOU BOUGHT ME INTO
THE PRACTICE WITHOUT ASKING ME.

30:08.834 --> 30:10.792
THAT MADE ME LESS OF A MAN.

30:10.834 --> 30:12.792
YOU MADE YOURSELF
LESS OF A MAN

30:12.834 --> 30:15.166
WHEN YOU SPENT ALL THE MONEY
IN YOUR BANK ACCOUNT.

30:15.208 --> 30:17.709
YOU KNOW WHAT? LET'S JUST...
START OVER HERE.

30:17.750 --> 30:20.709
NO, NO, NO, NO. THIS IS GOOD.
GET IT ALL OUT. THIS IS GOOD.

30:20.750 --> 30:23.083
CHARLOTTE KING
FINALLY OPENS UP. COME ON.
WHAT'S THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

30:23.125 --> 30:25.417
I MEAN, I AM THERE FOR YOU
AND THERE FOR YOU,

30:25.458 --> 30:27.917
BUT ALL YOU WANT TO DO
IS SCREW AND NOT TALK AND--

30:27.959 --> 30:30.041
ALL I WANT TO DO IS SCREW?
ALL I WANT TO DO?

30:30.083 --> 30:32.750
OH, YOU ARE GONNA
HAVE TO LOOK IN THE MIRROR,

30:32.792 --> 30:35.041
BECAUSE THE POT IS DEFINITELY
CALLING THE KETTLE BLACK.

30:35.083 --> 30:37.041
SCREW IS ALL YOU KNOW
HOW TO DO.

30:37.083 --> 30:39.041
NO, NO, NO. NO, I'M A PERSON.

30:39.083 --> 30:41.834
I'M A WHOLE PERSON
WITH FEELINGS AND FRIENDS

30:41.875 --> 30:45.333
AND A PRACTICE FULL OF PATIENTS,
AND WHAT DO YOU HAVE?
YOU.

30:45.375 --> 30:48.375
DON'T YOU SAY THAT LIKE
IT'S AN INSULT. DON'T YOU DARE.

30:48.417 --> 30:51.375
I AM NOT A FREAK.
I'M NOT THE FREAK, CHARLOTTE.

30:51.417 --> 30:55.083
I'M NOT THE FREAK THAT GOT FIRED
BECAUSE I'M HEARTLESS.

30:55.125 --> 30:56.917
CHARLOTTE--

30:56.959 --> 31:00.041
NO, YOU'RE THE FREAK
WHO NEEDED ME TO BAIL YOU OUT,

31:00.083 --> 31:02.166
WHICH IS HOW I KNOW
I'M NOT HEARTLESS.

31:02.208 --> 31:05.166
THE 50 GRAND I SPENT TO BUY YOUR
ASS A PLACE IN THIS PRACTICE

31:05.208 --> 31:07.625
PROVES I AM NOT HEARTLESS.
AND WE'RE BACK
TO THE MONEY AGAIN?

31:07.667 --> 31:10.834
YOU ARE SUCH A BITCH
THAT YOU CAN'T--
I DO WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE.

31:10.875 --> 31:13.750
I DO WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE,
AND YOU RESENT ME.

31:13.792 --> 31:15.959
WHY, 'CAUSE I DON'T GO
ALL CRYBABY EVERY FIVE SECONDS?

31:16.000 --> 31:17.959
IT'S NOT ABOUT CRYING.
IT'S NOT ABOUT CRYING.

31:18.000 --> 31:19.333
IT'S ABOUT BEING A PERSON.

31:19.375 --> 31:22.041
IT'S ABOUT BEING
A NORMAL WOMAN, FOR ONCE.

31:22.083 --> 31:24.041
IT'S NOT MY FAULT
YOU'RE NOT A MAN.

31:24.083 --> 31:26.375
SO DON'T TELL ME
I'M NOT A WOMAN.

31:26.417 --> 31:28.917
(clatters)

31:31.166 --> 31:34.041
I LITERALLY--I AM FULL
OF HATRED RIGHT NOW.

31:34.083 --> 31:36.041
OH, JOIN THE FREAKIN' CLUB.
W--

31:36.083 --> 31:39.041
DO YOU KNOW HOW RIDICULOUS IT IS
THAT YOU WOULD TAKE ME ASIDE--

31:39.083 --> 31:41.000
COULD YOU ANSWER ONE QUESTION?
YOU CAN'T SEPARATE--
I HAVE ANSWERED IT.

31:43.667 --> 31:45.291
THERE'S THE HEARTBEAT.

31:45.333 --> 31:48.875
AND IT'S STRONG.

31:48.917 --> 31:50.291
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

31:50.333 --> 31:53.792
SO... I HAVE TO ASK YOU THIS.

31:53.834 --> 31:57.375
HAS ANYONE EVER TALKED TO YOU
ABOUT ADOPTION?

31:57.417 --> 32:00.041
WHAT, LIKE WHEN YOU PICK
A FAMILY FROM THE "PennySaver"?

32:00.083 --> 32:02.041
NO. THAT'S JUST IN "JUNO."

32:02.083 --> 32:04.792
NO, IN REAL LIFE,
THERE ARE AGENCIES,

32:04.834 --> 32:08.041
AND ALL THEY DO
IS SCREEN FAMILIES.

32:08.083 --> 32:10.041
THEY FIND YOU SAFE,
WONDERFUL FAMILIES

32:10.083 --> 32:13.041
WHO WOULD LOVE YOUR BABY
AS MUCH AS YOU DO.

32:13.083 --> 32:16.041
THERE ARE AGENCIES. IN FACT,
WE HAVE ONE AT THE PRACTICE.

32:16.083 --> 32:18.625
DON'T TELL MARK THAT WE'RE
HAVING THIS CONVERSATION,

32:18.667 --> 32:21.041
'CAUSE I KNOW THAT
HE'D FREAK OUT, AND, LIKE,

32:21.083 --> 32:23.083
ALL MY STUFF
IS STILL AT HIS APARTMENT.

32:23.125 --> 32:25.917
NO, I'M--I'M YOUR DOCTOR,
SO I CAN'T TELL ANYONE

32:25.959 --> 32:27.291
ANYTHING
THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.

32:27.333 --> 32:29.291
AND--AND FOR THE RECORD,

32:29.333 --> 32:32.041
I THINK THAT YOU COULD BE
A GREAT MOM, SLOAN,

32:32.083 --> 32:34.041
AND I KNOW MARK WOULD BE
AN AMAZING--

32:34.083 --> 32:36.625
SO THESE AGENCIES...

32:36.667 --> 32:39.583
LIKE, WHAT EXACTLY DO THEY DO?

32:39.625 --> 32:42.709

32:44.417 --> 32:46.750
WE ARE BREAKING UP.

32:46.792 --> 32:49.000
COOP, WE'RE HAVING A FIGHT.

32:49.041 --> 32:52.750
NO, WE'RE DONE.

32:52.792 --> 32:54.125
I'M DONE.

32:54.166 --> 32:56.125
YOU DON'T GET TO BE DONE.

32:56.166 --> 32:59.041
YOU DON'T GET TO DECIDE
WHAT HAPPENS TO US.
GOOD-BYE, CHARLOTTE.

32:59.083 --> 33:01.667
OKAY, THIS...

33:01.709 --> 33:03.875
THIS IS THE PROBLEM
RIGHT HERE.

33:03.917 --> 33:06.667
YOU WON'T MAN UP AND FACE STUFF.
YOU WANT TO JUST CUT AND RUN.

33:06.709 --> 33:09.250
WE'RE HAVING A FIGHT.
NO, THE PROBLEM IS...

33:09.291 --> 33:11.375
YOU ARE A SEX TOY
I FOUND ON THE INTERNET.

33:11.417 --> 33:14.041
THE PROBLEM IS, YOU'RE JUST
A TRASHY LITTLE GIRL

33:14.083 --> 33:16.041
WHO'S TRYING TO PLEASE
HER DEAD DADDY,

33:16.083 --> 33:19.709
AND I SHOULDN'T HAVE
EXPECTED MUCH FROM YOU.

33:19.750 --> 33:21.917

33:21.959 --> 33:25.083
YOU ACT WARM,
ALL CUTE, CUDDLY COOPER.

33:25.125 --> 33:28.083
BUT THE BITCH OF IT IS,
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO'S HEARTLESS,

33:28.125 --> 33:30.041
NOT ME.

33:30.083 --> 33:32.917
