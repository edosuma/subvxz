WEBVTT

01:51.152 --> 01:54.155
That ain't football. Hmph.

02:24.102 --> 02:25.812
Hey!

07:17.395 --> 07:20.565
Now, that's what I call real football.

07:38.666 --> 07:40.293
ANNOUNCER [OVER SPEAKER]:
<i>Yo, bros.</i>

07:40.293 --> 07:43.838
<i>Take your boards and sign up
for the big surf competition today.</i>

07:45.298 --> 07:49.969
<i>First place is a mondo-big pile of cash.
Second place wins a fabulous mystery prize.</i>

07:49.969 --> 07:52.180
<i>Event sponsored
by Big Cheese of the High Seas.</i>

08:01.439 --> 08:03.566
Surf's up.

08:11.365 --> 08:17.079
Oh, dear, I hope I'm good enough
to win the surfing contest today.

08:18.331 --> 08:20.875
You fellows wanna watch me win?

08:42.772 --> 08:48.277
<i>Time to hit those heavies.
Let the surf competition begin.</i>

08:52.740 --> 08:58.621
I think I'll change into something
a bit less constricting.

09:04.335 --> 09:08.714
Get a load of my baggies.
I like to shoot the curl in style.

09:25.564 --> 09:30.861
<i>Oh, yes. The judges
should be stoked by such masterful ripping.</i>

09:40.746 --> 09:44.333
<i>Whoa, check out cat dude
trying to hog the dog.</i>

09:44.792 --> 09:47.628
<i>And he eats chowder.</i>

09:52.717 --> 09:56.137
<i>The judges will not dig such rude moves.</i>

10:03.102 --> 10:04.812
<i>Not too heinous.</i>

10:04.812 --> 10:06.731
<i>Skillfully done, little Jer.</i>

10:12.737 --> 10:17.408
<i>Okay, dudes and dudettes, heh,
time for the second heat.</i>

10:23.873 --> 10:26.375
These are my doggers.

10:26.375 --> 10:28.836
Heh, heh. Woof.

10:36.385 --> 10:39.722
Now, don't distract me. I could wipe out.

10:45.102 --> 10:46.395
Whoa!

10:48.522 --> 10:49.940
<i>Low blow.</i>

10:49.940 --> 10:52.985
<i>That is gonna cost you,
cat and mouse dudes.</i>

10:56.989 --> 11:00.743
<i>And Jer is penalized
for bouncing off dog dude's head.</i>

11:08.125 --> 11:11.629
<i>The judges have decided
to give Droopy another go...</i>

11:11.629 --> 11:15.216
<i>...without interference
from cat and mouse dudes.</i>

11:24.100 --> 11:27.103
Presto change-o.

11:42.993 --> 11:46.831
<i>Ha, check out dog dude walking the board.</i>

11:50.543 --> 11:51.836
<i>Whoa, dude.</i>

11:51.836 --> 11:55.297
<i>With scores like these, dog dude's
got a gnarly chance to win first place.</i>

11:56.841 --> 12:01.637
<i>Now, the heat is on.
See who can catch the Droopster.</i>

12:02.763 --> 12:06.267
<i>Whoa, this Tom cat's
sick with mad tricks.</i>

12:06.267 --> 12:09.812
<i>We're seeing some history in the making,
ladies and gentle-dudes.</i>

12:18.696 --> 12:21.115
<i>This is little Jer's final run.</i>

12:21.949 --> 12:25.286
<i>Let's see what mouse dude
can come up with.</i>

12:26.745 --> 12:29.498
<i>- And it's crab city for cat dude.</i>
- Ow!

12:59.111 --> 13:01.989
Yo, bros. That was intense.

13:01.989 --> 13:03.199
The votes are in.

13:03.199 --> 13:06.368
And the winner
of the big pile of cash is...

13:07.953 --> 13:09.455
...Droopy.

13:10.122 --> 13:11.832
Oh, goody.

13:21.175 --> 13:22.426
Aloha, dudes.

13:23.761 --> 13:25.721
Dude, two dogs?

13:26.597 --> 13:28.349
Did not see that coming.

13:28.349 --> 13:31.101
Oh, well. Can't change the past.

13:31.101 --> 13:33.729
And now for second place.

13:33.729 --> 13:36.982
Tom has a one-point total
ahead of little Jer.

13:36.982 --> 13:38.609
He wins second place:

13:38.609 --> 13:44.031
A lifetime supply of cheese.

13:46.158 --> 13:48.118
Compliments of
Big Cheese of the High Seas.

13:49.662 --> 13:52.581
Oh, think fast, mouse dude.
Just a little parting gift.

13:53.999 --> 13:57.753
Surf wax. Don't wipe it all in one place.

14:22.361 --> 14:24.238
Tyke, my dear old son of mine.

14:24.863 --> 14:28.367
Today's the day youse is gonna learn
how to play tennis.

14:31.996 --> 14:34.915
And I know somebody
to show you all the ropes.

14:34.915 --> 14:36.667
A regular tennis pro.

14:40.170 --> 14:42.423
Now, ain't that nice?

14:42.423 --> 14:48.137
Tom's resting up so he has the energy
to teach my son how to play tennis.

15:01.984 --> 15:03.652
Now, now, Tykey.

15:03.652 --> 15:08.490
So, cat, you're gonna teach my son a little
something about this game of tennis?

15:10.075 --> 15:12.286
Well, you are the tennis pro.

15:17.458 --> 15:22.004
I want you to teach my boy
everything there is to know about the game.

15:22.004 --> 15:23.505
Got it?

15:27.760 --> 15:30.262
We need a net.

15:36.644 --> 15:38.187
Where's the rest of the court?

15:45.110 --> 15:47.071
Tsk, tsk, tsk.

16:12.388 --> 16:14.598
And there's one more thing
you should know.

16:14.598 --> 16:19.228
If you mess around with my boy,
it'll be the last thing that you do.

16:19.228 --> 16:20.896
Got it?

17:02.896 --> 17:05.232
You okay, my boy?

17:06.692 --> 17:08.652
Now, you listen to me, cat.

17:08.652 --> 17:13.365
I see any more funny business
going on with my boy, and I'll pound you.

17:13.365 --> 17:15.117
And not only would I pound you...

17:15.659 --> 17:19.913
...but I'll grab you
and plant you in the court like so.

17:19.913 --> 17:21.957
And then...

17:23.417 --> 17:24.460
...I grab some of this.

17:26.086 --> 17:27.755
Like so.

17:27.755 --> 17:29.840
And then...

17:30.841 --> 17:33.051
...I do this.

17:33.719 --> 17:37.306
Which, of course,
would lead me to do this.

17:44.938 --> 17:49.318
But, of course, I don't wanna do that.
Now, do I?

18:09.713 --> 18:12.591
No more funny business.

19:11.108 --> 19:13.026
All right, that's it.

19:22.244 --> 19:25.205
So you wanna play rough
with my little boy?

19:25.205 --> 19:28.208
Then play rough it is.

19:30.919 --> 19:33.505
It's my turn to serve.

19:55.193 --> 19:57.946
Huh? Ooh!

19:57.946 --> 20:01.950
Attaboy, Tyke.
I think you finally got the hang of it.

20:04.286 --> 20:08.874
Okay, cat. Try this one on for size.

20:17.799 --> 20:21.637
Hey, way to go, Tyke.
That's the way to hit him back.

20:22.346 --> 20:25.307
Oh, good one. Keep it up, son.

20:25.307 --> 20:28.936
Hey, you're gonna be a champ
in no time.
