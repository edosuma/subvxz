12:37.049 --> 12:38.926
Yeah.

12:39.384 --> 12:40.969
And you like danger.

12:42.429 --> 12:43.889
I can tell that about you.

12:45.015 --> 12:46.517
And I like it.

12:49.853 --> 12:51.104
Who's he?

12:53.565 --> 12:54.858
We call him Prince.

12:54.942 --> 12:57.402

13:09.665 --> 13:13.252
I hope you understand, Fiona,
that this is a...

13:13.335 --> 13:15.712
a rare night, uh,

13:15.796 --> 13:17.881

Another bourbon?

13:57.671 --> 13:58.797

14:39.421 --> 14:40.881
May I assume...

14:40.964 --> 14:42.174
that you'd like to kiss me?

14:56.438 --> 14:59.691
(WHISPERING) This was a mistake.
I ran out of sleeping pills.

14:59.775 --> 15:01.443
-It was a bad idea.
-Don't go.

15:01.527 --> 15:03.445
This is not just a one-night stand.

15:03.529 --> 15:05.906
That is exactly what it is,

15:05.989 --> 15:07.199
a one-night stand.

15:09.243 --> 15:10.369
It could be our destiny.

my destiny is here

15:19.962 --> 15:21.380
Life is full of surprises.

15:21.463 --> 15:24.466
Well, I've had enough surprises
for two lifetimes.

15:24.550 --> 15:26.218
I'm through with surprises.

15:26.718 --> 15:28.762
Were you surprised
that you wanted to kiss me?

15:34.142 --> 15:35.727
Oh...

15:35.811 --> 15:38.105
No, you don't want
anything to do with me.

15:39.189 --> 15:41.692
I am a wretched human being.

15:42.401 --> 15:44.319
A miserable, mean goddamn bitch,

15:44.403 --> 15:46.196
I always have been.

15:46.280 --> 15:48.156
I've had three husbands.

15:48.240 --> 15:51.785
I've destroyed every decent relationship
I have ever had,

15:51.869 --> 15:53.787
including one with my daughter.

15:54.746 --> 15:56.039

Okay, let's table love, then.

they got evil sleeping under their roof,

22:11.290 --> 22:13.333

You ask her.

You want to come live with us?

22:38.650 --> 22:40.402

22:43.488 --> 22:45.490

22:47.826 --> 22:49.494
and you will have a home.

and break the truce
for no bowl of gumbo.

know what it feel like

23:04.760 --> 23:08.514

to some pretty little white girl.

got to feel that way again.

And even the Supreme
won't be able to touch you.

23:30.035 --> 23:31.870

23:41.338 --> 23:43.674
Oh, don't you worry about that, child.

24:10.534 --> 24:13.954
"Goddamn, what have I been
doing all these years?"

24:15.038 --> 24:16.456

24:16.540 --> 24:17.541
No, thank you.

24:19.126 --> 24:22.296
I would say everything
is different now...

24:24.590 --> 24:26.091
But it's not.

24:26.508 --> 24:29.303
Everything around here
is exactly the same.

24:29.386 --> 24:32.097
Only difference is...

24:32.181 --> 24:33.682
Now I see it.

24:34.850 --> 24:37.769
The Axeman was a bad spirit.

24:37.853 --> 24:41.106
You not only brought him here,
you sent him packing,

24:41.190 --> 24:45.903
which means
you are one hot shit witch.

24:46.695 --> 24:49.531
Power like yours does not go
unnoticed.

24:49.615 --> 24:52.659
Which means you've got
a bull's-eye on your back, kiddo,

24:52.743 --> 24:57.372
and our biggest enemy
is locked, loaded, and looking at you.

24:59.499 --> 25:00.918
Marie Laveau.

25:01.001 --> 25:02.169
My mother.

25:02.669 --> 25:03.754
But she's on our side.

25:03.837 --> 25:08.217
Fiona Goode has been on the same side
her whole life, her own.

25:09.843 --> 25:12.638
Now, I don't know
if you are the next Supreme,

25:12.721 --> 25:14.139
nobody does,

25:14.223 --> 25:16.975
but if she jumps to that conclusion,
right or wrong,

25:17.059 --> 25:19.228
she will slit your throat

25:19.895 --> 25:21.396
just like she did to Madison.

25:21.480 --> 25:23.857
Nobody knows who killed Madison,
not even Madison.

25:23.941 --> 25:25.984
She doesn't, but I do.

25:27.402 --> 25:28.654
My mother killed her

25:28.737 --> 25:31.198
because she thought Madison
was the next leader of our coven.

25:31.740 --> 25:35.202
She wanted to absorb her power,
her life force.

25:38.705 --> 25:41.834
So if she even thinks you're next...

25:43.919 --> 25:45.254
You're next.

25:49.216 --> 25:50.676
Holy shit.

25:50.759 --> 25:52.135
Right?

25:55.055 --> 25:57.599
Fiona is fading, growing weaker.

25:58.642 --> 26:01.436
Which only makes her more dangerous.

26:01.520 --> 26:04.815
A wounded animal will rip you apart
if it's cornered.

26:07.067 --> 26:08.944
So what do we do?

26:10.821 --> 26:12.197
It's simple.

26:15.200 --> 26:17.035
We're going to kill my mother.

26:17.744 --> 26:20.330
Kill her once,
kill her good,

26:21.248 --> 26:22.708

27:04.833 --> 27:09.671
but, uh, that dead body in your bathtub

27:09.755 --> 27:13.050
is going to start putting off
some very noxious odors soon.

27:13.133 --> 27:14.760

tidy up after you, didn't you?

27:31.610 --> 27:33.028
but I've called the police,

27:33.111 --> 27:35.155
and they're gonna be coming shortly.

27:35.239 --> 27:36.657
Oh, you'd never do that.

27:37.658 --> 27:38.992
You hate the coppers.

27:39.493 --> 27:41.828
We're one and the same,
you and me.

27:45.582 --> 27:50.003
When was the last time that
your body made a light show, huh?

27:51.964 --> 27:53.966
My guess is never.

27:58.011 --> 27:59.555
You're afraid.

28:00.889 --> 28:03.183
You're afraid of your own pleasure.

28:04.601 --> 28:06.562
It makes you feel weak,

28:06.645 --> 28:09.898
like you need somebody.
That's why you're going.

28:09.982 --> 28:12.693
You're drawing ridiculous conclusions.

28:12.776 --> 28:15.821
I don't even know your name
and I don't care to.

28:19.575 --> 28:21.368
You don't know me,

28:21.451 --> 28:23.912
but there's nothing
I don't know about you.

28:23.996 --> 28:27.583
Your secrets, your dreams, everything.

28:28.250 --> 28:31.461
I've been watching over you
since you were eight years old.

28:48.228 --> 28:50.480
You think you're special, little witch?

28:50.564 --> 28:51.982
What's your name?

28:52.941 --> 28:54.026
Fiona Goode.

28:54.109 --> 28:56.069
Do you know what happens
to scrawny little girls

28:56.153 --> 28:58.238
who stick their heads
up above the others?

28:58.322 --> 28:59.740
They get it chopped off.

28:59.823 --> 29:01.158
I'm not afraid of you, Helen.

29:03.827 --> 29:05.037
Pick it up.

29:11.293 --> 29:13.212
Now hold the glass above your head.

29:18.884 --> 29:20.344
You know what to do.

29:23.639 --> 29:24.640
No!

29:28.477 --> 29:30.062

29:46.828 --> 29:48.539
I knew I didn't do it.

29:49.206 --> 29:50.958
Why did you help me?

29:51.834 --> 29:53.085
Who are you?

29:56.964 --> 29:58.298
What are you?

29:59.216 --> 30:02.427
At first, I saw you
as the daughter that I never had.

30:04.972 --> 30:08.684
<i>I wanted to protect my, my little flower.</i>

30:12.020 --> 30:14.481

<i>There's nothing fragile about you, Fiona.</i>

30:21.154 --> 30:25.367

30:25.450 --> 30:28.036

30:28.120 --> 30:30.664
<i>and the steel running down</i>

30:31.707 --> 30:35.127
<i>You were the most fearsome thing</i>

30:38.463 --> 30:43.135
<i>And while others only saw</i>

30:44.094 --> 30:48.098
<i>I saw so, so much more.</i>

30:53.896 --> 30:57.733
<i>And my feelings...</i>
<i>became complicated.</i>

31:00.569 --> 31:02.946
<i>And I fell in love...</i>

31:06.783 --> 31:08.744
<i>But not like a father...</i>

31:10.454 --> 31:11.955
<i>Like a man.</i>

31:25.802 --> 31:28.013
I don't believe in ghosts.

31:28.096 --> 31:29.806
Nor did I feel like one.

31:29.890 --> 31:35.020
I felt like I was locked
in an airless closet for eternity.

31:35.103 --> 31:37.606
And when you arrived,
you gave meaning

31:37.689 --> 31:40.192
to my endless, tortured days.

31:40.275 --> 31:42.236
All I want to do
is give you pleasure.

31:42.319 --> 31:45.948
You deserve it.

You call that a seduction, huh?

32:03.257 --> 32:04.341
What an idiot,

32:05.217 --> 32:09.179
telling me my life story,
how you watched me grow old.

32:09.263 --> 32:12.558
What was that, a mercy lay?

32:13.392 --> 32:15.853
It was a, a culmination.

32:18.856 --> 32:20.023
Zip me up.

No, you keep your distance, lover boy.

Fine.

I feel fine.

How am I...

33:13.744 --> 33:15.495
Whose tongue is this?

33:15.579 --> 33:16.997
Yours.

33:20.501 --> 33:23.504
I found it the other day,
hidden away.

33:24.630 --> 33:26.798
<i>At first, I didn't realize what it was.</i>

33:26.882 --> 33:29.801

33:33.972 --> 33:36.141
But it wasn't. It was wet,

33:36.225 --> 33:37.893
alive...

33:37.976 --> 33:39.603
Because someone enchanted it.

33:40.729 --> 33:42.272
Isn't that right?

33:43.190 --> 33:44.483
Yes.

33:47.194 --> 33:48.946
"M.S."

33:51.740 --> 33:53.617
She wanted you to tell the truth.

33:53.700 --> 33:55.827
But that was the last thing
that you wanted to do.

33:55.911 --> 33:57.955
So you cut it out of your own head.

34:00.874 --> 34:02.626
-Answer me!
-Yes!

34:05.337 --> 34:07.506
But you didn't know that she kept it.

34:07.589 --> 34:10.175
But Myrtle wasn't witch enough
to restore it.

34:11.969 --> 34:13.470

-No!

The past is best left buried.

37:05.017 --> 37:08.478
I feel like
maybe we have a connection.

And my mama always said
that in order to be a true friend,

37:14.359 --> 37:17.279
you have to see the ugly
to appreciate the good.

You don't know this woman.

It's the reason I brought you here,
you dumb bitch.

45:45.621 --> 45:48.123

45:48.207 --> 45:51.126
I forgot to apply my Retin-A.

45:52.377 --> 45:54.713
You care to make the first cut?

45:55.756 --> 45:57.090
I'd love to.

45:59.134 --> 46:00.552
Wha... No!

46:00.636 --> 46:02.846
You stay away from me!

46:02.930 --> 46:05.766
You stay away from me,
you hear me?

46:06.600 --> 46:09.436
You stay away!

Beautiful.
