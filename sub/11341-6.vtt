[Gasping, sobbing]

00:55.703 --> 00:57.987
Please! No--

00:57.989 --> 00:59.288
thank you.

00:59.290 --> 01:01.507
Ok, just put everything
on the counter

01:01.509 --> 01:02.875
and I'll put it away later.

01:02.877 --> 01:04.010
I like your altar.

01:04.012 --> 01:05.595
Thank you.

01:05.597 --> 01:07.663
Yeah, there's still
a lot to do

01:07.665 --> 01:10.133
before the party
next week, and...

01:10.135 --> 01:11.217
I'm scared.

01:11.219 --> 01:13.636
I've never had the whole team
here before.

01:13.638 --> 01:15.021
Why are you doing
a Day of the Dead theme?

01:15.023 --> 01:16.222
Well, uh, my
stepfather's family

01:16.224 --> 01:17.673
always made a big deal
of it in Mexico,

01:17.675 --> 01:22.178
and my name is Penelope Garcia,
after all, so...

01:22.180 --> 01:23.813
Hey, could you check
my refrigerator

01:23.815 --> 01:25.865
and see if I have
enough hot sauce?

01:30.320 --> 01:33.706
You have some jalapeno sauce
here next to this jar of eyeballs,

01:33.708 --> 01:35.241
but I think you're
gonna need more,

01:35.243 --> 01:37.627
depending on which
guacamole you plan on making.

01:37.629 --> 01:38.861
You ok?

01:38.863 --> 01:41.030
You didn't even flinch.

01:41.032 --> 01:44.584
JJ's right. I told her I wanted
to go scary this Halloween,

01:44.586 --> 01:46.085
and she just
laughed at me

01:46.087 --> 01:48.871
and she said that
I don't have a scary side.

01:48.873 --> 01:50.840
I'm sorry. If it makes you
feel any better,

01:50.842 --> 01:52.258
you probably do.

01:52.260 --> 01:53.860
Really?
Yeah.

01:53.862 --> 01:55.878
The building blocks of the human

01:57.565 --> 01:59.765
to want to express
these hidden personalities,

01:59.767 --> 02:01.901

that everybody has one.

You have one?

02:03.905 --> 02:05.655
Oh, absolutely. Yeah.

02:05.657 --> 02:08.024
Ok. Ok.
I want to see it.

02:08.026 --> 02:12.228
I want to see Dr. Spencer Reid's
hidden personality.

02:12.230 --> 02:13.896
Uh--you, uh--
right here?

02:13.898 --> 02:15.698

you want to see it?

my cheeks right here, right now.

02:19.037 --> 02:20.569
Ok.

02:20.571 --> 02:22.455
Once you see it,
you can't unsee it.

You're thinking, did that guy just
fire 5 shots?

02:33.885 --> 02:36.585
Or did that guy
just fire 6 shots?

02:36.587 --> 02:39.972
You're gonna have to
ask yourself a question.

02:39.974 --> 02:46.863
Do you feel lucky, punk?

02:48.866 --> 02:50.867
That's Clint Eastwood,
in "Dirty Harry."

02:50.869 --> 02:51.868
Oh.

02:51.870 --> 02:53.102
I mean, I know it's
not as effective

02:53.104 --> 02:54.436
[text tone]
as my dominant personality,

02:54.438 --> 02:56.372
but I feel like there's--
Hey, look, we gotta go.

02:56.374 --> 02:58.324
these eyeballs,
do they need to be refrigerated--

02:58.326 --> 02:59.408
No. Let's go.

02:59.410 --> 03:02.128
Oh, I recognize that face
from somewhere.

03:02.130 --> 03:04.113
It's good to have you
back, Hotch.

03:04.115 --> 03:05.998
It's good to be back.
Thanks.

And under the heading

03:08.803 --> 03:12.221
A woman was found dead
yesterday near Provo, Utah,

03:12.223 --> 03:13.789
buried under
a pile of rocks.

03:13.791 --> 03:15.925
Her face was smashed.
Her head was smashed.

03:15.927 --> 03:17.643
Pretty much
everything smashed.

03:17.645 --> 03:19.061
24 hours later
she's still a Jane Doe?

03:19.063 --> 03:21.013
No personal items
were found at the scene,

03:21.015 --> 03:23.933
and the severity of her injuries
made official recognition impossible.

03:23.935 --> 03:26.235
So Provo missing persons
has like zero intel on her.

03:26.237 --> 03:27.737
Well, it looks like
the victim was tortured.

03:27.739 --> 03:31.307
Lacerations on both arms
and a burn in the neck area.

03:31.309 --> 03:32.775
It could be the killer's
way of silencing her,

03:32.777 --> 03:34.476
literally and figuratively.

03:34.478 --> 03:36.779
Rossi: The robe she's in
almost looks ceremonial.

03:36.781 --> 03:38.781
Yeah, the unsub must have
changed her clothing.

03:38.783 --> 03:40.283
Could be a straight-up
woman hater.

03:40.285 --> 03:42.418
Took away her clothes,
her voice, her identity.

03:42.420 --> 03:44.203
And then covered her
with rocks.

03:44.205 --> 03:48.457
Might be a concealment
or an expression of remorse.

03:48.459 --> 03:51.660
It looks like a makeshift
tomb, if you ask me.

03:51.662 --> 03:53.346
Have there been similar
killings in the area?

03:53.348 --> 03:55.298
None that we know.
I'm impressed, Hotch.

03:55.300 --> 03:56.966
How'd you get the brass
to let us investigate

03:56.968 --> 03:58.267
a single, isolated murder?

03:58.269 --> 04:00.052
I told them that
the ritualistic nature

04:00.054 --> 04:01.837
means that he's forensically
sophisticated and organized

04:01.839 --> 04:03.306
and he's likely
killed before.

04:03.308 --> 04:05.107
And likely will kill again.

04:05.109 --> 04:07.893
Which means we can't waste time.
Wheels up in 20.

She joined it
right out of high school.

Mm-hmm. She left the sect

from the medical examiner.

06:18.228 --> 06:19.844
JJ and I will talk
to Gloria's family

06:19.846 --> 06:22.463
as well as have a chat
with Herbert Sykes.

06:28.821 --> 06:33.908
A couple of fossil hunters
nosing around up here found her.

06:33.910 --> 06:35.660
Those the rocks?

06:35.662 --> 06:38.646
My men moved them
off her body.

06:38.648 --> 06:40.582
But that's all
anyone's touched them.

06:40.584 --> 06:43.818
These are sedimentary
conglomerates with rounded clasts.

06:43.820 --> 06:44.953
If you say so.

06:44.955 --> 06:46.621
That means that
geologically speaking,

06:46.623 --> 06:48.206
they don't belong up here.
The rest of this canyon

06:48.208 --> 06:50.375
is tertiary rhyolite volcanics,
which means the unsub

06:50.377 --> 06:51.659
must have brought
these rocks with him.

06:51.661 --> 06:54.179
Which would be noisy
and time-consuming.

06:54.181 --> 06:56.548
So the unsub obviously
felt comfortable enough up here

06:56.550 --> 06:58.099
to take the time
that he needed.

been here before.

was the radius

about 200 yards in all directions.

07:06.393 --> 07:08.176
We didn't find anything.

07:08.178 --> 07:10.528

that out a little further.

[Bird screeching]

07:14.867 --> 07:18.352

07:20.657 --> 07:23.374
Even though Gloria
chose to leave the community,

07:23.376 --> 07:25.593
her loss will be felt.

07:25.595 --> 07:27.512
We spoke to Gloria's
parents a little while ago

07:27.514 --> 07:29.514
and they said that you had
had a fight with Gloria

07:29.516 --> 07:31.533
the day that she left
the community.

07:31.535 --> 07:33.234
This had something to do
with your claim

07:33.236 --> 07:34.702
of divine heritage?

07:34.704 --> 07:38.840
I am the spiritual leader

07:38.842 --> 07:40.175
of my community.

07:40.177 --> 07:43.061
As such, I often speak
allegorically

07:43.063 --> 07:44.562
or in parables.

07:44.564 --> 07:48.483
But Gloria took the divine
heritage business literally.

07:48.485 --> 07:51.402
Yes. She dug around
in my family history

intention to leave.

08:02.916 --> 08:05.450

of that.

weren't told to shun her?

firm in the wake of the murder.

some more questions,

5 years ago,

09:14.237 --> 09:15.770
and they'll be in touch.

09:15.772 --> 09:19.490
Mr. Sykes, we're
investigating a murder,

09:19.492 --> 09:20.489
and I don't speak in parables,

09:20.514 --> 09:22.494
so this should be very easy
to understand.

09:22.495 --> 09:24.112
If you interfere with us
in any way,

09:24.114 --> 09:26.247
I will see to it
that you are charged with

09:26.249 --> 09:29.717
and prosecuted for
obstruction of justice.

09:30.619 --> 09:32.537
I've seen some bad ones
in my 15 years,

09:32.539 --> 09:35.006
but this was...bad.

09:35.008 --> 09:36.874
What was the C.O.D.?

09:36.876 --> 09:38.293
It's hard to pinpoint.

09:38.295 --> 09:40.995
Virtually every bone
in her body was crushed

09:40.997 --> 09:43.348
and every major organ
ruptured.

09:43.350 --> 09:45.516
My guess is skull fracture,
but honestly,

09:45.518 --> 09:48.353
any one of these internal
injuries might have killed her.

09:48.355 --> 09:49.854
What about
the lacerations?

09:49.856 --> 09:51.505
Could they have been
defensive wounds?

09:51.507 --> 09:53.341
No, they were in
a distinct pattern.

09:53.343 --> 09:56.311
Quite deep and severe
on the radius and ulna,

09:56.313 --> 09:59.614
but carefully placed
so as not to cause death.

09:59.616 --> 10:02.016
There would be substantial
bleeding from a wound like that?

10:02.018 --> 10:03.234
Absolutely.

10:03.236 --> 10:05.269
Yet there was minimal blood
at the crime scene.

10:05.271 --> 10:08.823
The victim suffered the lacerations
and burning somewhere else

10:08.825 --> 10:11.159
and was taken to the canyon
to be killed.

10:11.161 --> 10:13.294
But why not make it
one-stop shopping?

10:13.296 --> 10:15.880

even a short distance,

10:15.882 --> 10:18.049
would increase the risk
significantly.

10:18.051 --> 10:21.135
The tox report did show traces of
chlorpromazine in her system.

10:21.137 --> 10:24.088
A tranquilizer. That's what he used
to control her.

10:24.090 --> 10:27.141
There's something else
I wanted you to see.

10:28.227 --> 10:31.262
Fingernail polish
was removed.

10:31.264 --> 10:32.680
But crudely.

10:32.682 --> 10:35.566
A mixture of citrus juice
and vinegar.

10:35.568 --> 10:37.101
And where that
didn't do the trick,

10:37.103 --> 10:39.553
the polish was roughly
scraped off with a sharp object.

10:39.555 --> 10:42.573
Not how I remember
my ex-wives removing their polish.

10:42.575 --> 10:45.910
Well, this was done
to her, not by her.

10:50.282 --> 10:51.899
Reid: What used to be up here?

10:51.901 --> 10:54.735
The dirt road leading in
seems rather substantial.

10:54.737 --> 10:58.873
Salt mining. Hauled this stuff out
by the truckloads.

10:58.875 --> 11:01.092
These hills filled
a hell of a lot of salt shakers.

11:01.094 --> 11:03.294
Actually, less that 6%
of salt in the United States

11:03.296 --> 11:05.046
is used for food.
The vast majority of it

11:05.048 --> 11:07.849
goes for de-icing roads
and snow control.

11:07.851 --> 11:08.916
Morgan: Guys.

11:08.918 --> 11:11.018
Over here.

11:13.806 --> 11:15.723
You're right.

11:15.725 --> 11:18.276
The killer's been here before.

11:18.278 --> 11:21.929
And he seems to have
a preference for blondes.

11:42.617 --> 11:45.720
Kylie, this one looks good.

11:49.124 --> 11:50.425
I like it.

11:50.427 --> 11:51.726
Me, too.

11:51.728 --> 11:54.429
I think we could
find something in here for sure.

11:54.431 --> 11:55.730
Should we check it
out, then?

11:55.732 --> 11:56.731
Yeah.

11:56.733 --> 11:58.099
Ok.

11:58.101 --> 11:59.967
Let's go.

12:01.636 --> 12:04.021
Sorry, ma'am.
That's a reference book.

12:04.023 --> 12:05.523
It can't leave the library.

12:05.525 --> 12:07.241
Not even for one night?

12:07.243 --> 12:09.643
No, ma'am. But there is a
photocopy machine on the main floor

12:09.645 --> 12:12.196
if you want to make copies.
10 cents a page.

12:12.198 --> 12:13.865
Can we make copies?

12:13.867 --> 12:17.201
You know what, sweetie?
I gotta get ready for work.

12:17.203 --> 12:19.320
But we'll come back
tomorrow. Thank you.

12:19.322 --> 12:21.005
You promise?

12:21.007 --> 12:22.423
Promise.

12:22.425 --> 12:23.991
I hate when people
can't be flexible.

12:23.993 --> 12:27.044
I mean, who is it gonna hurt
to take the book for one night?

12:27.046 --> 12:29.514
How much is this book?

12:29.516 --> 12:31.015
Excuse me?

12:31.017 --> 12:33.501
To buy it. How much
to buy the book?

12:33.503 --> 12:36.354
This is a library, sir,
not a bookstore.

12:36.356 --> 12:37.722
Let's go, sweetie.

12:37.724 --> 12:38.806
Whoa, hold on, lady.

12:38.808 --> 12:39.774
Don't touch me.

12:39.776 --> 12:41.058
I'll make the photocopies
for you.

12:41.060 --> 12:43.277
Give me your phone number
and we can set up a time to--

12:43.279 --> 12:45.112
Time to go, sweetie.

12:50.018 --> 12:52.119
Dave, are you and Blake
still at the M.E.'s office?

12:52.121 --> 12:53.070
Just leaving now.

12:53.072 --> 12:54.572
Yeah, stay put.
Morgan and Reid found

12:54.574 --> 12:56.073
another body near
the first crime scene.

12:56.075 --> 12:58.359
22-year-old Abby Stafford.
She was a student

12:58.361 --> 12:59.527
at the University of Utah.

12:59.529 --> 13:00.828
Quick I.D.

13:00.830 --> 13:02.547
Yeah, her handbag
was found near the body.

13:02.549 --> 13:04.248
Any idea when she died?

13:04.250 --> 13:05.550
Morgan said the body's
been there for a while.

13:05.552 --> 13:07.635
Her roommate says that
she's been missing for a week.

13:07.637 --> 13:09.253
The body's on its way
to you now.

13:09.255 --> 13:10.538
Another rock burial?

13:10.540 --> 13:13.374
It appears she jumped
or was thrown off of a cliff.

13:13.376 --> 13:14.602
The autopsy's tomorrow,

13:14.627 --> 13:16.595
but the M.E. might be able
to tell us something now.

13:16.596 --> 13:18.396
Ok, we'll stay put.
By the way,

13:18.398 --> 13:21.182
have you had your audience
yet with the Dalai Lama?

13:21.184 --> 13:24.101
Yeah. He claims to know nothing
about the Gloria Carlyle murder.

13:24.103 --> 13:25.520
Rossi: Surprise, surprise.

13:25.522 --> 13:26.737
Blake: What's your take,
Hotch?

13:26.739 --> 13:28.105
Well, I think
he's telling the truth.

13:28.107 --> 13:29.524
You sound fairly certain.

13:29.526 --> 13:31.359
Yeah, money means more to Sykes
than ideology.

13:31.361 --> 13:34.278
He took a big financial hit after
the stoning death a few years ago.

13:34.280 --> 13:35.913
The last thing he wants
is any more trouble.

13:35.915 --> 13:37.164
Protecting his brand.

13:37.166 --> 13:39.000
Utopia incorporated.

13:39.002 --> 13:40.918
We'll check in
when the new body gets here.

13:40.920 --> 13:42.403
Thanks.

13:55.767 --> 13:58.603
I'm sorry I grabbed you before.

13:58.605 --> 14:00.104
Leave me the hell alone

14:00.106 --> 14:02.306
or I'm gonna go back inside
and call security.

14:02.308 --> 14:03.724
It's not against the law
to apologize.

14:03.726 --> 14:05.443
It's called stalking.

14:05.445 --> 14:07.595
And it is against the law.

14:07.597 --> 14:08.729
Stop following me.

14:08.731 --> 14:09.930
You need to calm down.

14:09.932 --> 14:11.482
I mean it.

14:11.484 --> 14:13.985
If I see you again,
I'm calling the cops.

14:17.706 --> 14:20.625
JJ, were you able to contact
Abby Stafford's family?

14:20.627 --> 14:23.110
No. They're vacationing
somewhere in Europe.

14:23.112 --> 14:26.080
We're tracking them down.
But I did talk to a friend of hers.

14:26.082 --> 14:28.583
She said Abby was
a conservative, studious type.

14:28.585 --> 14:30.051
No drama. No enemies.

14:30.053 --> 14:31.969
I just got off the phone
with Rossi.

14:31.971 --> 14:34.338
The M.E. says the new victim
died roughly a week ago.

14:34.340 --> 14:36.507
Had the same laceration
marks and throat burning,

14:36.509 --> 14:39.226
but the wounds weren't anywhere
near as severe as Gloria Carlyle's.

14:39.228 --> 14:41.128
He was still warming
to the task.

14:41.130 --> 14:44.348
Well, our unsub
definitely has a type.

14:44.350 --> 14:46.434
Young, blond, pretty.

14:46.436 --> 14:49.820
Now, the elements in common
to both murders aren't giving us much.

14:49.822 --> 14:51.639
Let's concentrate
on the deviations.

14:51.641 --> 14:54.609
Ok. Well, um, Abby
was thrown off a cliff.

14:54.611 --> 14:56.277
Gloria was entombed.

14:56.279 --> 14:59.497
The unsub left Abby in her own clothes
but changed Gloria into a robe.

14:59.499 --> 15:01.098
The M.E. found
another difference.

15:01.100 --> 15:04.085
Apparently Gloria's fingernail polish
had been removed by the unsub.

15:04.087 --> 15:06.904
Abby Stafford's hadn't been
tampered with at all.

15:06.906 --> 15:09.373
Well, Abby's death was
quick and impersonal-- of the cliff.

15:09.375 --> 15:10.708
No muss, no fuss.

15:10.710 --> 15:12.960
But Gloria was slowly crushed.

15:12.962 --> 15:15.846
He took his time
to make her suffer.

15:15.848 --> 15:18.933
All the deviations in Gloria's murder
involve increased ritual.

15:18.935 --> 15:20.851
It's got to be feeding
a fantasy of some kind.

15:20.853 --> 15:23.354
It explains why the torture
was more intense with Gloria.

15:23.356 --> 15:26.057
The ritual fed the fantasy,
the fantasy fed the rage.

15:26.059 --> 15:30.111
If that's the case,
this guy's evolving fast.

15:30.113 --> 15:32.680
No...

15:38.904 --> 15:41.405
The hour is upon us.

15:41.407 --> 15:42.707
[Moaning]

15:42.709 --> 15:45.993
With this, I send
your soul back to hell.

15:45.995 --> 15:47.044
[Breathing hard]

15:47.046 --> 15:48.579
No--

15:52.467 --> 15:55.536
[voices chanting]

16:10.455 --> 16:13.624
[Indistinct chatter]

16:18.997 --> 16:21.332
Thanks.

16:21.334 --> 16:23.133
Same signature.

16:23.135 --> 16:24.919
Lacerations.

16:24.921 --> 16:26.303
Burned throat.

16:26.305 --> 16:27.955
He's dressed in a robe.

16:27.957 --> 16:31.792
But this is a huge change
in both M.O. and victimology.

16:31.794 --> 16:33.811
Well, we knew the unsub
probably wouldn't chance

16:33.813 --> 16:36.931
going to the canyon again,
but a downtown city park?

16:36.933 --> 16:37.965
It's a complete 180.

16:37.967 --> 16:39.850
[Cell phone rings]

16:41.486 --> 16:44.405
Garcia, what's the lowdown
on Parker Mills?

16:44.407 --> 16:45.606
Oh, you got the low part right.

16:45.608 --> 16:47.274
Do you remember in science class
with the petri dishes

16:47.276 --> 16:50.143
and the mold and the algae
and the slime and the gunk?

16:50.145 --> 16:51.645
Yeah, I appreciate
the scientific perspective,

16:51.647 --> 16:52.947
but what are you saying?

16:52.949 --> 16:55.449
I'm saying grade-a pervert.

16:55.451 --> 16:57.368
There is not a ladies
underwear drawer

16:57.370 --> 17:00.087
that this man did not want
to dive face-first in.

17:00.089 --> 17:01.505
So I'm guessing
a rap sheet?

17:01.507 --> 17:04.208
As long as the telescope he used
to peer into the girls locker room.

17:04.210 --> 17:07.627
If it is something scuzzy,
Parker Mills has done it.

17:07.630 --> 17:08.996
Peeping Tom, a stalk,

17:08.998 --> 17:10.714
non-consensual frottage,

17:10.715 --> 17:12.766
which, BTW, is rubbing
your body

17:12.768 --> 17:15.019
on, near, or against the
vicinity of somebody else's--

17:15.021 --> 17:16.936
Let me call you back,
Garcia.

17:16.939 --> 17:18.222
Hey, check this out.

17:18.223 --> 17:21.976
This burn was shallow
and more distinct.

17:21.978 --> 17:23.727
There's a pattern.

17:23.729 --> 17:26.079
A design.

17:26.082 --> 17:28.515
The victims weren't
just being burned.

17:28.517 --> 17:30.183
They're being branded.

17:33.538 --> 17:35.289
So this guy's
killing men now.

17:35.291 --> 17:38.659
Parker Mills must have had a hidden
or perceived connection

17:38.661 --> 17:40.027
to the other victims.

17:40.029 --> 17:41.578
Or Mills got in the way
somehow and had to be killed

17:41.580 --> 17:43.998
so the unsub could return to
his preferred victim type.

17:44.000 --> 17:46.567
Then why bother with
the cutting and throat burning?

17:46.569 --> 17:48.252
Excuse me.

17:51.172 --> 17:52.389
Interesting.

17:52.391 --> 17:53.757
What is it?

17:53.759 --> 17:55.642
Tox report on Abby Stafford.

17:55.644 --> 17:58.395
Our conservative, studious girl
had cocaine in her system

17:58.397 --> 18:00.397
at the time of her death.

18:03.184 --> 18:05.486
We're looking for
a physically fit male

18:05.488 --> 18:07.237
from his late 20s
to mid 30s.

18:07.239 --> 18:09.573
He's brazen, confident,
and organized.

18:09.575 --> 18:12.042
This person may be
a moral vigilante.

18:12.044 --> 18:13.711
Abby Stafford
had drug issues.

18:13.713 --> 18:15.846
Gloria Carlyle moved in
with her boyfriend.

18:15.848 --> 18:17.448
Parker Mills
was a sexual deviate.

18:17.450 --> 18:19.416
Moral vigilantism
typically has its roots

18:19.418 --> 18:21.335
in repression and guilt.

18:21.337 --> 18:24.922
This generally manifests itself in
low self-esteem and self-loathing.

18:24.924 --> 18:28.575
By punishing others, the unsub
may also be punishing himself.

18:28.577 --> 18:30.577
He's also literally
branding his victims.

18:30.579 --> 18:33.297
We're not sure why, but he's likely
marking them as his own.

18:33.299 --> 18:35.632
His organizational skills
suggest someone

18:35.634 --> 18:37.751
who can get and keep
a full-time job.

18:37.753 --> 18:39.753
But the work is likely
low level.

18:39.755 --> 18:41.421
His impaired social
development

18:41.423 --> 18:44.375
would not allow him to move very far
in the professional world.

18:44.377 --> 18:47.761
JJ: Consequently, this is someone
working in solitude,

18:47.763 --> 18:49.763
having minimal interaction
with others.

18:49.765 --> 18:51.698
Morgan: And this makes it
a challenge to determine

18:51.700 --> 18:53.734
how and where this person
is choosing his victims.

18:53.736 --> 18:56.103
The two female victims
were reserved and studious.

18:56.105 --> 18:59.873
Parker Mills lived quietly
in the margins of conventional society.

18:59.875 --> 19:02.442
So the killer may frequent
or work in locations

19:02.444 --> 19:04.378
that attracts
this type of person.

19:04.380 --> 19:06.964
Uh, places of solitude,
contemplation.

19:06.966 --> 19:10.584
Museums, gardens and parks,
bookstores.

19:10.586 --> 19:13.637
His choice of a city square
rather than a remote canyon

19:13.639 --> 19:15.622
means he's gaining
confidence.

19:15.624 --> 19:18.392
Morgan: But the recklessness
of killing in such a public space

19:18.394 --> 19:21.294
suggests that this confidence
may be stemming from a delusion.

19:21.296 --> 19:23.313
Blake: He may believe
he's in a place and time

19:23.315 --> 19:24.731
that makes him invulnerable.

19:24.733 --> 19:27.067
Hotch: And if his delusion
is gaining in strength,

19:27.069 --> 19:30.521
then his next killing may be
riskier and more dramatic.

19:30.523 --> 19:31.989
Thank you.

19:55.630 --> 19:56.630
Aah!

19:56.632 --> 19:58.265
[Gasps]

19:58.267 --> 19:59.766
Aah!

20:04.222 --> 20:05.505
Aah!

20:09.978 --> 20:12.196
I told Dr. Reid
he could use my office.

20:12.198 --> 20:14.681
There must be 30 books
piled up on my desk.

20:14.683 --> 20:17.151
Well, that's either
some light bedtime reading

20:17.153 --> 20:18.986
or he's actually
onto something.

20:18.988 --> 20:21.538
You know, I was thinking
about that branding thing.

20:21.540 --> 20:24.191
Maybe it's like that book
we had to read in school,

20:24.193 --> 20:25.876
about the woman
with the Scarlet A.

20:25.878 --> 20:26.960
No, that's unlikely.

20:26.962 --> 20:28.662
The Scarlet letter
was a badge of shame

20:28.664 --> 20:30.414
to be worn in public
day after day.

20:30.416 --> 20:33.917
Our unsub is killing his victims
immediately after the branding.

20:33.919 --> 20:37.004
There's something strange
going on here.

20:37.006 --> 20:39.089
Well, that may be
the understatement of the week.

20:39.091 --> 20:41.925
Gloria's vision was extremely poor.
Her driver's license

20:41.927 --> 20:45.429
specifies she had to wear corrective
lenses while operating a vehicle.

20:45.431 --> 20:46.480
Eyeglass.

20:46.482 --> 20:48.265
It says here
she wore contact lenses.

20:48.267 --> 20:50.918
No contact lenses were found on
her body or at the crime scene.

20:50.920 --> 20:52.402
The unsub must have
taken them out,

20:52.404 --> 20:54.404
like he removed
her nail polish.

20:54.406 --> 20:56.023
But why would he do that?

20:56.025 --> 20:59.059
No wristwatch was found
at the crime scene either.

20:59.061 --> 21:02.496
Nail polish, wristwatch,
contact lenses.

21:02.498 --> 21:05.082
What if he was trying
to strip her of items

21:05.084 --> 21:07.367
that reminded him
of the modern era?

21:07.369 --> 21:09.419
It could be
part of his delusion.

21:09.421 --> 21:11.255
Like changing her
into a simple robe.

21:11.257 --> 21:14.258
He needed to take Gloria
back to a primitive time

21:14.260 --> 21:16.126
before
he could kill her.

21:22.483 --> 21:24.718
[Mouthing silently]

21:45.823 --> 21:47.607
Leland, there you are.

21:47.609 --> 21:51.078
You need to get your
new parking permit downstairs.

21:51.080 --> 21:53.280
Ok. As soon as
my shift's over.

21:53.282 --> 21:54.322
No, do it now.

21:54.347 --> 21:56.267
You keep putting it off
and today's the last day.

21:56.969 --> 22:00.304
I'll watch your area
until you get back.

22:05.426 --> 22:07.261
Hotch: What have you got?
Reid: Guys, check this out.

22:07.263 --> 22:09.646
The pattern in the branding mark
has design characteristics

22:09.648 --> 22:11.648
similar to family crests
from the late middle ages.

22:11.650 --> 22:13.150
I found this encyclopedia
of heraldry and look.

22:13.152 --> 22:16.236
It's the seal of William Stoughton,
a Magistrate.

22:16.238 --> 22:18.805
Check when and where
he's a Magistrate.

22:18.807 --> 22:21.408
Salem, Massachusetts, 1692.

22:21.410 --> 22:24.528
Stoughton was the lead
prosecutor in the Salem Witch trials.

22:24.530 --> 22:28.031
So this unsub believes
he's hunting witches.

22:33.371 --> 22:34.671
Where is it?

22:34.673 --> 22:35.672
Where's what?

22:35.674 --> 22:38.041
The book!

22:38.043 --> 22:40.327
[Quietly] The book

22:40.329 --> 22:42.129
that was right there.

22:42.131 --> 22:43.180
Where is it?

22:43.182 --> 22:44.331
It's been checked out.

22:44.333 --> 22:45.299
What?

22:45.301 --> 22:47.134
A woman came in
while you were gone,

22:47.136 --> 22:49.720
said you told her yesterday
that it was a reference book

22:49.722 --> 22:51.188
and couldn't be checked out.

22:51.190 --> 22:53.223
This is a lending library.

22:53.225 --> 22:54.474
Remember?

22:54.476 --> 22:56.276
Don't worry.
Yeah, but--

22:56.278 --> 22:59.679
I logged the book
into the system and gave it to her.

23:06.704 --> 23:09.522
...little cotton balls
on it.

23:09.524 --> 23:11.792
Next week I think we're
gonna make little fish

23:11.794 --> 23:13.960
with gills that sparkle.

23:44.575 --> 23:49.396
[Overlapping voices laughing]

23:55.620 --> 23:57.570
Here, I'll carry the book.

23:58.706 --> 24:01.124
Mom: Got it?

24:01.126 --> 24:02.592
Ok.

24:17.489 --> 24:19.457
Blake: Our unsub chose
the right role model.

24:19.459 --> 24:23.160
Stoughton was the most ruthless
of all of the Salem prosecutors.

24:23.162 --> 24:24.880
Our killer's also emulating
the methods of execution

24:24.905 --> 24:26.265
at the time of the trials.

24:26.266 --> 24:29.150
Witches were thrown off cliffs,
hung, slowly crushed by rocks.

24:29.152 --> 24:31.953
So the family crest thing,
is that his way of honoring the guy?

24:31.955 --> 24:32.897
It's more than that. He may believe

24:32.922 --> 24:34.473
he's a direct descendent
of Stoughton.

24:34.474 --> 24:37.525
Garcia, were you able to run a
history yet of the Stoughton family tree?

24:37.527 --> 24:39.010
It isn't so much a tree

24:39.012 --> 24:40.812
as it is a giant sequoia--

24:40.814 --> 24:43.031
branches, twigs, roots,
sticks, limbs,

24:43.033 --> 24:44.866
pine cones, woodpecker holes.

24:44.868 --> 24:47.702
There are literally thousands
of Stoughton's descendents out there.

24:47.704 --> 24:50.321
Are there any in the Provo
or Salt Lake city area?

24:50.323 --> 24:53.041
Yeah, there's a handful, but none
of them fit the unsub's profile.

24:53.043 --> 24:54.859
Can you send me the
Stoughtons' ancestry chart?

24:54.861 --> 24:56.544
Did you hear the part I said
about the giant Sequoia?

24:56.546 --> 24:58.696
I can send it to you,
but unless your laptop screen

24:58.698 --> 25:00.531
is the size of a drive-in
movie theater--

25:00.533 --> 25:02.366
send it anyway.
We'll print out a hard copy here.

25:02.368 --> 25:04.469
I'm going to send the side of the tree
that migrated westward,

25:04.471 --> 25:06.871
and do not say
I did not warn you.

25:06.873 --> 25:09.507
You're going to need
a bigger copy machine.

25:25.024 --> 25:26.107
Hon...

25:26.109 --> 25:27.942
Baby?

25:29.445 --> 25:31.228
[Gasps]

25:32.498 --> 25:35.950
Where are we?

25:35.952 --> 25:39.671
"By the grace of the defenders
of the faith,

25:39.673 --> 25:43.240
"these two did engage
in the detestable arts

25:43.242 --> 25:45.343
called witchcraft
and sorcery."

25:45.345 --> 25:46.377
What?

25:46.379 --> 25:47.712
"These sorceries
were wickedly

25:47.714 --> 25:50.265
and feloniously used
against others."

25:50.267 --> 25:51.516
What are you talking about?

25:51.518 --> 25:53.384
"For such delving
into witchcraft...

25:53.386 --> 25:55.920
Witchcraft?
Is this statute made and provided."

25:55.922 --> 25:58.439
No. No, this is crazy.

25:58.441 --> 26:00.141
Please, just let us go.

26:00.143 --> 26:01.809
W-wait.

26:01.811 --> 26:04.562
Don't hurt us.
No, don't hurt us.

26:04.564 --> 26:05.897
You're making a mistake.

26:05.899 --> 26:08.032
Don't.

26:08.034 --> 26:11.268
No. No! Don't hurt us!

26:16.041 --> 26:17.792
[Mouthing silently]

26:17.794 --> 26:22.163
I've learned to stop
asking questions about this guy.

26:37.062 --> 26:38.646
JJ: What's up, Spence?

26:38.648 --> 26:41.349
There's something strange about
this one branch of the family tree.

26:41.351 --> 26:42.466
Garcia?

26:42.468 --> 26:44.352
Talk to me.
I am fluent in genius.

26:44.354 --> 26:46.654
Roy and Becky Danary,
they died in 1985,

26:46.656 --> 26:49.023
leaving behind a son
named William Danary,

26:49.025 --> 26:50.658
but there's no record
of what happened to him.

26:50.660 --> 26:53.511
The Danarys were Peace Corps
workers in Ecuador.

26:53.513 --> 26:56.331
They died in a car accident
there.

26:56.333 --> 26:58.816
And you're right,
their kid just sort of vanished.

26:58.818 --> 27:00.985
Let me do some digging
and I will call you back.

27:00.987 --> 27:02.870
All right, well, we profiled
the unsub as delusional.

27:02.872 --> 27:06.374
What if Stoughton being
a great-great-great-whatever

27:06.376 --> 27:07.875
is just part of his delusion?

27:07.877 --> 27:10.712
Or the discover of being a direct
descendent triggered the delusion.

27:10.714 --> 27:11.846
He looked into
his ancestry.

27:11.848 --> 27:13.431
That would be easy
to do here.

27:13.433 --> 27:16.333
Salt Lake City has the largest
family history library in the world.

27:16.335 --> 27:19.103
Gloria Carlyle researched
Herbert Sykes' ancestry.

27:19.105 --> 27:21.189
Abby Stafford was
a bookish college student.

27:21.191 --> 27:23.441
Maybe that's where they
crossed--at a library.

27:23.443 --> 27:24.776
JJ, have Garcia
get the names

27:24.778 --> 27:26.778
of all the employees
and volunteers

27:26.780 --> 27:28.863
in the Provo and Salt
Lake City library system

27:28.865 --> 27:32.533
and cross-check those with
descendents of William Stoughton.

27:40.859 --> 27:43.077
Who are you?

27:43.996 --> 27:46.697
[Gasping]

28:05.884 --> 28:09.320
Is that was this
is about, the book?

28:10.322 --> 28:12.389
Take it.
I don't want it.

28:12.391 --> 28:16.611
I'm just making my daughter
a costume for Halloween.

28:16.613 --> 28:20.448
That's all. We were just looking
at the book for ideas.

28:20.450 --> 28:22.900
Do you confess your crimes?

28:22.902 --> 28:24.452
What crimes?

28:24.454 --> 28:26.337
What are you
talking about?

28:27.706 --> 28:29.424
[Whimpering]

28:31.543 --> 28:36.247
The court will be merciful
if you confess.

28:36.249 --> 28:37.915
I didn't do anything!

28:37.917 --> 28:40.268
Oh, baby.
[Kylie moans]

28:40.270 --> 28:43.187
Listen to me.
Just let my daughter go.

28:43.189 --> 28:45.422
She's innocent.
Just...

28:45.424 --> 28:47.542
Let her go, and...

28:47.544 --> 28:50.278
And you and I,
we could talk, ok?

28:51.313 --> 28:54.198
The indictment accuses
both of you.

28:54.200 --> 28:58.152
Do you willingly
confess to your crimes?

28:58.154 --> 29:00.955
Or must a confession
be extracted from you?

29:00.957 --> 29:02.957
You're crazy!

29:06.628 --> 29:09.213
[Crying]

29:21.426 --> 29:22.727
Hey, I have a thing.
Hotch: What is it, Garcia?

29:22.729 --> 29:25.346
No library employees
are direct descendents

29:25.348 --> 29:27.631
of William Stoughton.
However, there's a volunteer

29:27.633 --> 29:30.935
with a fascinating
family history there.

29:30.937 --> 29:35.823
Leland Duncan, son of Orland
and Clara Duncan, Mormon missionaries.

29:35.825 --> 29:37.692
But the Duncans aren't part
of the Stoughton lineage.

29:37.694 --> 29:39.310
But, a big kiss
to who can guess

29:39.312 --> 29:41.863
where they were doing
their missionary work in 1985.

29:41.865 --> 29:44.081
Ecuador.
Ding, ding, we have a winner.

29:44.083 --> 29:46.617
Same time and place as the Peace
Corps couple that died and left a son.

29:46.619 --> 29:49.036
So the Duncans adopted the boy
and changed his name.

29:49.038 --> 29:50.821
I'm sending you a current photo
of Leland Duncan

29:50.823 --> 29:53.157
along with his home address.
There.

29:53.159 --> 29:54.509
Hotch: Thanks.

30:03.268 --> 30:04.552
It's clear here.

30:04.554 --> 30:06.354
Blake: Clear.

30:29.044 --> 30:31.045
Ok. Thanks.

30:31.047 --> 30:35.166
Apartment's empty, but Leland's
definitely our guy.

31:11.253 --> 31:13.120
What are you doing?

31:15.907 --> 31:18.042
The court needs
your confessions first.

31:18.044 --> 31:20.511
Wait! Stop!
No, I'll confess!

31:20.513 --> 31:22.847
You don't
have to do this.

31:22.849 --> 31:24.748
[Whimpering]

31:24.750 --> 31:27.018
I'll admit it.

31:30.772 --> 31:33.190
I am a witch.

31:39.865 --> 31:42.599
I'll call you back,
Garcia.

31:42.601 --> 31:45.536
Victim's Charlotte Novak.
She's one of the librarians.

31:45.538 --> 31:47.038
When was she
last seen alive?

31:47.040 --> 31:49.373
Around 3:30. She came to
the main circulation desk

31:49.375 --> 31:52.243
to put a book into the system,
then she went back to Leland's section.

31:52.245 --> 31:53.411
What was the book?

31:53.413 --> 31:56.380
"An Illustrated History
of Witchcraft and Sorcery."

31:56.382 --> 31:57.748
That was his lure.

31:57.750 --> 32:00.451
And anyone who took the bait
was guilty of being a witch.

32:00.453 --> 32:01.618
Where's the book?

32:01.620 --> 32:03.671
Got checked out.
Yvonne Carpenter.

32:03.673 --> 32:04.972
All right, we need
to find her address

32:04.974 --> 32:07.624
and send units there
immediately.

32:20.355 --> 32:22.473
Was it my daughter?

32:22.475 --> 32:24.808
Your daughter?

32:24.810 --> 32:28.663
Was she the one
who betrayed me?

32:28.665 --> 32:32.366
Your child is also a witch.

32:32.368 --> 32:33.951
Why would she help me?

32:33.953 --> 32:37.672
No. She's a witch hunter.

32:37.674 --> 32:41.075
Like you. She tried
to remove the curses

32:41.077 --> 32:42.526
I put on people.

32:42.528 --> 32:43.561
You lie.

32:43.563 --> 32:44.528
It's the truth.

32:44.530 --> 32:46.830
I can prove it.

32:46.832 --> 32:49.600
She has the mark
of the angel.

32:49.602 --> 32:51.185
It's on her hairline,

32:51.187 --> 32:54.188
just behind
her left ear. Look.

33:13.458 --> 33:15.876
You see it, don't you?

33:17.695 --> 33:20.864
Mark of the angel.

33:29.725 --> 33:32.126
[Crying]

33:38.734 --> 33:41.218
There's gotta be a secondary
location somewhere.

33:41.220 --> 33:44.522
I know, but Garcia said
that Leland Duncan's adoptive parents

33:44.524 --> 33:45.656
never had an address
in the area.

33:45.658 --> 33:47.074
Garcia.
Talk to me.

33:47.076 --> 33:48.692
What was Clara Duncan's
maiden name?

33:48.694 --> 33:50.111
Andrews. Clara Andrews.

33:50.113 --> 33:51.395
Did they ever
live in the area?

33:51.397 --> 33:53.781
I'm working on it.
Give me a sec.

33:53.783 --> 33:56.000
Yvonne Carpenter and
her daughter are both gone.

33:56.002 --> 33:59.754
My officer said the apartment
showed signs of a struggle.

34:07.245 --> 34:10.464
Your daughter has been
released from custody.

34:10.466 --> 34:11.632
[Crying]

34:11.634 --> 34:14.385
When she wakes up,
she is free to go.

34:14.387 --> 34:16.270
Thank God.

34:16.272 --> 34:18.572
The court accepts
the confession of witchcraft.

34:18.574 --> 34:19.857
What?

34:19.859 --> 34:22.393
Your sentence of execution
will be carried out at sundown.

34:22.395 --> 34:23.444
No!

34:23.446 --> 34:25.612
You said you'd show mercy!

34:25.614 --> 34:26.897
[Sobs]

34:26.899 --> 34:30.266
Please don't do this!

34:30.268 --> 34:34.038
Leland's adoptive mother,
neither of her parents are still alive.

34:34.040 --> 34:35.489
But get this--
they owned property

34:35.491 --> 34:38.108
that is 2.8 miles
from the canyon crime scene.

34:38.110 --> 34:39.710
Who lives there now?
Nobody.

34:39.712 --> 34:41.378
It was condemned by
the county 8 years ago.

34:41.380 --> 34:42.746
As far as I can tell,
it's abandoned.

34:42.748 --> 34:44.415
All right, send the coordinates
to Rossi, Blake, and Morgan.

34:44.417 --> 34:46.500
Sending it.
Thanks.

34:50.722 --> 34:53.090
It is time.

34:53.092 --> 34:56.092
No! No! Don't!

34:59.347 --> 35:02.132
[Grunting]

35:02.134 --> 35:04.985
[Screaming and shouting]

35:04.987 --> 35:07.404
Move aside!

35:07.406 --> 35:08.972
[Gasping]

Let us pass!
[Shouting]

35:13.411 --> 35:15.779
Guilty! She's guilty!

35:15.781 --> 35:18.032
Wait. Wait.

35:18.034 --> 35:20.534
Why is my daughter
tied up?

35:20.536 --> 35:23.120
You said she was free to go.

35:23.122 --> 35:26.123
[Screaming and shouting]

35:26.125 --> 35:27.124
This is--

35:27.126 --> 35:28.709
You are a witch.

35:28.711 --> 35:32.096
She is your daughter.
It's in the blood.

35:32.098 --> 35:33.264
No!

35:33.266 --> 35:35.933
The court promised mercy
and you shall have it.

35:35.935 --> 35:38.669
You will be burned first.

35:38.671 --> 35:40.938
Burned? No!

35:40.940 --> 35:43.190
You'll be spared seeing your
daughter suffer the flames.

35:43.192 --> 35:45.842
No! No!

35:45.844 --> 35:47.995
Aah!

35:55.749 --> 35:57.200
She's a little girl.

35:57.202 --> 35:59.969
She's never hurt anyone.

35:59.971 --> 36:01.888
[Crying]

36:04.141 --> 36:07.276
The accused
have been convicted

36:07.278 --> 36:10.513
of the horrible crime
of witchcraft...

36:10.515 --> 36:12.031
And found guilty.
No...No...

36:12.033 --> 36:15.151
Sentence will now
be carried out.

36:15.153 --> 36:17.453
[Cheering]

36:17.455 --> 36:20.406
Please! Please don't do this!

36:20.408 --> 36:22.691

and lay flat on your stomach.

36:45.732 --> 36:47.383
Morgan: Do it.

36:48.352 --> 36:51.404
No. No, stay.

36:51.406 --> 36:53.189

[Music playing]

37:55.003 --> 37:56.302
JJ: So I looked it up.

37:56.304 --> 37:58.671
No witches were ever burned
at the stake in Salem.

37:58.673 --> 37:59.739
Rossi: Really?

37:59.741 --> 38:02.141
Death by fire was strictly
a European thing.

38:02.143 --> 38:04.410
Moral of the story:
Be selective

38:04.412 --> 38:06.262
where you practice
your witchcraft.

38:06.264 --> 38:07.730

38:13.070 --> 38:14.803
I thought you couldn't come.

38:14.805 --> 38:16.572
Well, Jack got a last-minute
sleep-over invitation,

38:16.574 --> 38:18.140
so I hope it's ok.

38:18.142 --> 38:20.326
Yes, of course, of course.

38:20.328 --> 38:22.144
And happy almost birthday.
I will keep it on the D.L.

38:22.146 --> 38:23.312
Thank you.

38:23.314 --> 38:26.115
Ok, everybody,
I guess it's time to start.

38:26.117 --> 38:27.983
Here you go, sir.
Thank you.

38:27.985 --> 38:30.152
Uh...I want to thank
everybody

38:30.154 --> 38:32.004
for doing this with me,

38:32.006 --> 38:33.989
and our altar's burning,

38:33.991 --> 38:37.627
and I just feel so blessed
to have you all here.

38:37.629 --> 38:40.963
I will start. Uh...

38:40.965 --> 38:43.182
This is my mom and dad.

38:43.184 --> 38:44.517
I miss them.

38:44.519 --> 38:47.637
And this is my cat Simba

38:47.639 --> 38:50.339
with his usual bowl
of soda pop.

38:50.341 --> 38:52.525
He's a weird cat.
[Laughs]

38:52.527 --> 38:54.343
Ok. Who's next?

38:54.345 --> 38:56.178
Uh, ok. Well, uh,

38:56.180 --> 39:00.232
this is my sister Roslyn.

39:00.234 --> 39:01.517
Ros.

39:01.519 --> 39:04.687
She always dreamt that someday
she'd live in Paree,

39:04.689 --> 39:07.073
so, um...it didn't happen,

39:07.075 --> 39:11.243
but I thought this
would bring her some happiness.

39:14.581 --> 39:17.866
Private First Class
Darryl Jenson.

39:17.868 --> 39:20.753
We lost him during
the Tet offensive.

Morgan:
What are the tickets?

39:22.707 --> 39:24.640
Opening day next season,
Wrigley,

39:24.642 --> 39:26.676
right behind the home dugout.

39:26.678 --> 39:29.145
Jenson was a diehard
Cubs fan.

39:29.147 --> 39:30.563
Sweet.

39:31.982 --> 39:33.766
Um...

39:34.985 --> 39:36.402
My mom.

39:36.404 --> 39:40.823
She was the one who got me
into crossword puzzles--

39:40.825 --> 39:42.942
no erasing allowed--

39:42.944 --> 39:46.562
which got me into
linguistics.

39:46.564 --> 39:48.698
You said we could
bring more than one, right?

39:48.700 --> 39:52.752
Oh, yes. This is a come one,
come all altar.

39:57.924 --> 40:01.043
It's Nikola Tesla.

40:01.045 --> 40:04.714
I figured he's probably been
inventing things on the other side,

40:04.716 --> 40:07.967
so hopefully he'll
bring something to us.

40:07.969 --> 40:11.137
I guess that's me. Ok.

40:11.139 --> 40:12.271
I brought...

40:12.273 --> 40:15.441
my pops.

40:15.443 --> 40:18.561
He was a cigar aficionado,
big time. [Chuckles]

40:18.563 --> 40:21.447
And, actually, Rossi, he was
also a huge Cubbies fan,

40:21.449 --> 40:23.649
so I was thinking maybe
he and private Jenson over there,

40:23.651 --> 40:25.151
maybe they could
go to the game together.

40:25.153 --> 40:28.237
They can sort that out
when they get here.

40:34.327 --> 40:37.713
Well, I guess
this is proof positive

40:37.715 --> 40:41.467
that ancestry
ain't all bad.

40:41.469 --> 40:45.054
How about a toast
to the...

40:45.056 --> 40:46.889
30 or 40 of us?

40:46.891 --> 40:47.890
Cheers.

40:47.892 --> 40:48.841
Cheers.
