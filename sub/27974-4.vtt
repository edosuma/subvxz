00:01.767 --> 00:03.806
It's the start of a new era.

00:03.807 --> 00:06.767
In Oxford, it's out with the old
and in with the new.

00:07.767 --> 00:09.766
As Councillor Clive Burkitt,

00:09.767 --> 00:11.806
in charge of the
planning and housing department,

00:11.807 --> 00:14.302
welcomes the first tenant
to Cranmer House,

00:14.303 --> 00:15.767
one of three tower blocks

00:15.768 --> 00:18.126
at Oxford's new
Martyrs' Field development.

00:18.127 --> 00:20.547
A stunning feat of modern engineering,

00:20.548 --> 00:22.767
changing the Oxford skyline forever.

00:24.100 --> 00:27.580
Councillor Burkitt is keen
to hand over the first set of keys.

00:28.459 --> 00:30.865
For Mrs Olive Reynolds
and daughter Sandra,

00:30.890 --> 00:32.183
this is a dream come true.

00:32.208 --> 00:34.207
A top floor flat,
and just look at the view!

00:36.486 --> 00:38.486
What a brave new world.

00:40.000 --> 00:46.074

02:13.446 --> 02:15.446
Ten minutes, Miss Paroo.

03:05.492 --> 03:07.492
I'll chase up any stragglers.

03:22.767 --> 03:23.767
Hello?

03:24.857 --> 03:26.767
The library is closed!

03:44.376 --> 03:45.376
Hello.

03:56.162 --> 03:57.162
No!

04:34.376 --> 04:35.843
Shit the bed?

04:36.376 --> 04:37.483
I was in early.

04:38.376 --> 04:42.004
- Well, DeBryn's been and gone.
- Any idea who they were?

04:42.005 --> 04:43.575
Junkies. Pair of 'em.

04:43.576 --> 04:45.375
I meant a name.

04:45.376 --> 04:48.375
- Done the owner a favour, in any case.
- How's that?

04:48.376 --> 04:52.375
The rest of the place has
cleared out. He can finally sell it.

04:52.376 --> 04:54.831
- Morning.
- Christ, what's this?

04:54.832 --> 04:57.075
You pair should get
on Opportunity Knocks.

04:57.076 --> 04:58.376
"Me and my bloody shadow."

04:58.963 --> 05:00.375
I didn't think I had you down till ten.

05:01.003 --> 05:02.375
Heard it come over the RT.

05:03.181 --> 05:04.473
Just wondered if there were
any similarities

05:04.498 --> 05:06.497
with that tramp from the alley
the other month.

05:06.522 --> 05:08.042
Well, they're dead...

05:09.155 --> 05:10.155
...so there's that.

05:10.377 --> 05:13.376
Well, I'll leave you ladies to it.

05:15.376 --> 05:17.376
- Al.
- Mm-hm.

05:26.235 --> 05:27.435
Win.

05:31.843 --> 05:33.375
I said I'd get it back.

05:33.376 --> 05:37.375
It's not all of it.
Not yet, but it will be.

05:37.803 --> 05:41.603
There's, er... enough there for
that new oven you've been wanting.

05:43.376 --> 05:45.683
And something for yourself, obviously.

05:47.056 --> 05:48.376
A new frock or two.

05:49.376 --> 05:50.736
I thought a holiday, maybe.

05:51.576 --> 05:53.375
Where did it come from?

05:53.815 --> 05:54.855
Where?

05:55.793 --> 05:57.376
I got it back. That's where.

06:00.125 --> 06:02.683
- From where it went, I got it back.
- Charlie...

06:03.736 --> 06:05.375
...I don't believe you.

06:05.376 --> 06:06.376
Winnie!

06:08.376 --> 06:12.375
A bit of overtime here and there,
it soon adds up.

06:12.376 --> 06:13.575
Overtime?

06:13.923 --> 06:17.012
What, the sort of overtime
that leaves your knuckles raw,

06:17.013 --> 06:18.376
and blood on your cuffs?

06:18.377 --> 06:20.376
That sort of overtime?

06:21.149 --> 06:22.988
You can keep it.

06:23.216 --> 06:24.883
I don't want any part of it.

06:39.376 --> 06:40.865
Doctor.

06:40.866 --> 06:42.375
Inspector.

06:42.376 --> 06:46.375
Osbert Page... Chief Librarian.

06:46.376 --> 06:48.375
Found by Lucy Paroo, one of the juniors.

06:49.043 --> 06:51.375
Single stab wound to the back.

06:51.376 --> 06:55.055
Defensive injuries.
A pretty vicious attack.

06:55.056 --> 06:57.843
Cause of death most likely
to be massive haemorrhage.

06:58.376 --> 06:59.376
Time?

06:59.377 --> 07:01.216
12 to 18 hours.

07:02.275 --> 07:04.683
The library would have closed
about seven last night, so...

07:08.189 --> 07:11.188
Wood chisel. Unusual choice of weapon.

07:11.213 --> 07:13.212
Now, as far as I can see,

07:13.237 --> 07:15.236
from the distribution of blood spatter,

07:15.261 --> 07:18.260
the attack took place in this aisle.

07:18.603 --> 07:23.276
He made half a dozen paces, before
being overcome by his injuries.

07:23.277 --> 07:26.672
Be able to give you chapter
and verse after the post-mortem.

07:26.673 --> 07:28.083
Shall we say two o'clock?

07:29.376 --> 07:30.576
Sir.

07:35.376 --> 07:36.784
Muddy boot prints.

07:36.785 --> 07:38.376
Oh, yes.

07:38.377 --> 07:41.375
Evidence of mud and dirt
was found amongst the blood.

07:41.376 --> 07:43.575
Sample's been taken by forensics.

07:43.576 --> 07:45.896
Give you the full gen once it's in.

07:50.376 --> 07:51.376
Family?

07:51.803 --> 07:53.375
Not that I know of.

07:53.763 --> 07:56.746
He lived alone in Jericho.

07:56.747 --> 07:58.113
What was he like?

07:58.114 --> 07:59.376
Set in his ways.

08:00.376 --> 08:02.375
Quite disagreeable
when the mood was on him,

08:02.376 --> 08:03.896
which was most of the time.

08:04.957 --> 08:08.963
He lived for the library
and his walking, of course.

08:10.376 --> 08:12.376
He was a keen rambler.

08:13.137 --> 08:15.736
Did he get on well
with the rest of his colleagues?

08:16.083 --> 08:18.215
I suppose.

08:18.216 --> 08:20.376
I've not been here very long, so...

08:21.736 --> 08:23.375
Who else was in here?

08:23.376 --> 08:25.823
Well, there were only
a couple of regulars.

08:25.824 --> 08:27.376
Where were they sitting?

08:27.816 --> 08:28.976
Er...

08:30.065 --> 08:32.375
...Professor Burrowes was sitting there.

08:32.376 --> 08:35.722
And Dr Nicholson was sitting just here.

08:41.169 --> 08:43.168
What are they, dons?

08:43.193 --> 08:44.523
Yes, that's right.

09:01.376 --> 09:03.376
"Memoirs Of A Voluptuary."

09:04.903 --> 09:06.742
Isn't that part of the Phi Collection?

09:06.896 --> 09:08.375
Yes, I believe so.

09:08.376 --> 09:12.612
Oh. Well, I'd be interested to know
who asked for it to be brought up.

09:12.613 --> 09:15.843
Of course.
If you'll just give me a moment.

09:20.376 --> 09:24.016
- The Phi Collection?
- Yeah. Obscene or libellous works

09:24.017 --> 09:25.376
that aren't available to all readers.

09:25.377 --> 09:28.376
A special request has to be made
to the librarian for access.

09:28.823 --> 09:30.065
Whoever did for Page,

09:30.066 --> 09:32.341
would have hidden in the library
after closing, would you think?

09:32.366 --> 09:33.375
Mm.

09:33.376 --> 09:35.375
Plenty of places
for a man to hide in here.

09:35.376 --> 09:38.375
It was Dr Nicholson who put in
the request for the book.

09:38.763 --> 09:42.375
I should have remembered, because
Mr Page got a bit batey about it.

09:42.376 --> 09:43.376
Why's that?

09:43.843 --> 09:47.376
Dr Nicholson was always after one
book or another from the collection.

09:48.376 --> 09:51.603
I'll be grateful for a list of all
of the other books he asked for.

09:52.376 --> 09:54.375
Oh, I don't suppose you remember anyone

09:54.376 --> 09:55.850
wearing a pair of muddy boots, do you?

09:55.875 --> 09:57.375
- Muddy boots?
- Mm.

09:57.376 --> 10:00.375
No, Mr Page would not
have stood for that.

10:00.376 --> 10:02.683
Well, thank you, Miss Paroo.

10:09.376 --> 10:10.376
Good morning.

10:10.377 --> 10:13.807
I intend today to deal
with Godel's Completeness Theorem,

10:13.808 --> 10:17.375
which states that if a formula
is logically valid,

10:17.376 --> 10:24.056
then there is a finite deduction,
or formal proof, of the formula.

10:25.563 --> 10:27.575
Is this a joke?

10:27.576 --> 10:29.376
Who did this?

10:30.896 --> 10:32.376
Who did this?!

10:44.376 --> 10:45.376
Well...

10:46.376 --> 10:49.375
...either Osbert Page
was the untidiest librarian

10:49.376 --> 10:52.376
- to ever draw breath...
- Or somebody's beaten us to it.

10:55.376 --> 10:56.763
Muddy boot prints.

11:00.376 --> 11:03.603
A dozen fatal overdoses from heroin
cut with quinine.

11:04.376 --> 11:06.376
And another two this morning,
most likely the same.

11:07.376 --> 11:09.729
I'd rather hoped Eddie Nero's demise

11:09.730 --> 11:12.375
had put an end to hard drugs in Oxford.

11:12.376 --> 11:14.375
In volume, at any event.

11:14.376 --> 11:15.575
You've spoken to DCI Box?

11:15.576 --> 11:19.375
Investigations are ongoing, apparently.

11:19.376 --> 11:20.963
DS Jago's bailiwick.

11:22.056 --> 11:25.375
And the consignment recovered from
the car crash the other month?

11:25.376 --> 11:27.375
Languishing in the evidence store.

11:27.376 --> 11:29.376
Anything further on the car?

11:29.889 --> 11:33.375
Stolen just over a year ago
travelling under false plates.

11:33.376 --> 11:35.612
And no-one's come forward to
claim the driver's body as yet?

11:35.637 --> 11:36.645
No.

11:37.032 --> 11:40.376
Although it's fair to assume
he was some, sort of, courier.

11:41.376 --> 11:43.375
Is there any word on the cartridge
that was found?

11:43.376 --> 11:45.375
According to DeBryn,

11:45.376 --> 11:48.215
it came from the same gun
that killed George Fancy.

11:48.216 --> 11:49.375
He's certain?

11:49.376 --> 11:52.056
No doubt. Something to do
with a mark on the rim.

11:52.896 --> 11:54.375
Imperfection in the hammer.

11:54.376 --> 11:56.375
Reliable as fingerprints, apparently.

11:56.376 --> 11:59.454
I've been trawling through Oxford
city and county records for a match,

11:59.455 --> 12:02.643
right back to the '40s,
but, so far, nothing.

12:04.376 --> 12:06.843
Unless, of course, it's come
from outside our ground.

12:14.643 --> 12:17.963
It's a disgrace.
Been open less than a year.

12:26.376 --> 12:28.719
Everybody's been complaining about it

12:28.720 --> 12:30.415
and now it's affecting my daughter.

12:30.416 --> 12:31.895
She's not been well.

12:31.896 --> 12:34.415
It's the damp. It's got onto her chest.

12:34.416 --> 12:35.646
Damp?

12:35.647 --> 12:38.376
Yeah. Come and have a look for yourself.

12:44.376 --> 12:46.896
That's not damp, Mrs Reynolds.

12:48.256 --> 12:51.095
- How long's it been like this?
- Since we moved in.

12:51.120 --> 12:54.119
I tried painting over it, but it
just comes back through again.

12:54.216 --> 12:57.376
It's not just me, it's happening
in loads of other flats.

13:03.736 --> 13:04.966
Anything?

13:04.967 --> 13:08.375
Well, not unless this map
of the Gower has any bearing.

13:08.376 --> 13:10.375
What's that? Greek, is it?

13:10.376 --> 13:12.603
Mm. Anemoi. Wind gods.

13:13.631 --> 13:15.217
What about that, "HB"?

13:15.218 --> 13:16.376
"HB"?

13:17.376 --> 13:19.803
No, your guess is as good as mine.

13:21.376 --> 13:22.376
Happen whoever turned this place over

13:22.377 --> 13:24.376
found what they were looking for.

13:25.189 --> 13:26.708
I'll get forensics over.

13:27.283 --> 13:30.376
Meantime, we can give those readers
at the library a spin.

13:35.376 --> 13:36.376
Sir.

13:55.705 --> 13:56.705
Dr Nicholson?

13:58.099 --> 13:59.704
About the fun and games, is it?

13:59.705 --> 14:01.045
What fun and games?

14:01.046 --> 14:02.704
The stuff left in his cubby, sir.

14:03.163 --> 14:04.704
Bits of metal.

14:04.705 --> 14:06.704
An amulet, I suppose you'd call it,

14:06.705 --> 14:08.963
with Greek writing or something on it.

14:09.390 --> 14:12.285
One of the undergrads said someone's
been writing the word "Dora"

14:12.286 --> 14:13.358
upon his blackboard.

14:13.383 --> 14:14.904
- Dora?
- That's right, sir.

14:14.905 --> 14:17.704
In the lecture theatre
and in his tutorial.

14:17.705 --> 14:19.705
How long's this been going on?

14:20.705 --> 14:22.705
About a month or so, I suppose.

14:23.380 --> 14:25.704
I've offered to call the police
before now,

14:25.705 --> 14:27.704
but he didn't seem too keen.

14:27.705 --> 14:31.704
You were at the Bodleian
yesterday evening, Dr Nicholson.

14:31.705 --> 14:32.705
Yes.

14:32.706 --> 14:34.704
We'd like to know what time
you arrived, what time you left,

14:34.705 --> 14:37.704
where you went from the library
and if anyone can vouch for you.

14:37.705 --> 14:43.219
Oh, I was, erm... arrived about five,

14:43.220 --> 14:46.704
left just before seven and, er...
went home.

14:46.705 --> 14:49.904
- Can anyone confirm that?
- My wife was out for the evening.

14:49.905 --> 14:51.704
She returned about 11.

14:51.705 --> 14:54.704
Did you happen to notice
anyone unusual or out of place

14:54.705 --> 14:56.704
hanging around the library
about the time you left?

14:57.123 --> 15:00.704
Someone wearing muddy boots, perhaps.

15:00.705 --> 15:01.829
Muddy boots?

15:01.830 --> 15:04.704
There were muddy boot prints
on the floor at the library.

15:05.185 --> 15:06.185
Indeed.

15:07.140 --> 15:12.705
No. No, er... no, I think
I would have remembered that.

15:13.705 --> 15:15.705
Did you know Mr Page, personally?

15:16.618 --> 15:22.323
As a librarian, yes,
but no... not personally.

15:22.705 --> 15:26.545
I'm sorry I-I can't be
of greater assistance.

15:27.619 --> 15:30.618
Unless there was anything else
I can help you with.

15:30.643 --> 15:32.017
Er... there was just one thing.

15:32.042 --> 15:34.666
This book you've had
out of the Phi Collection.

15:34.705 --> 15:36.704
Memoirs Of A...

15:36.705 --> 15:37.705
What was it, Morse?

15:37.706 --> 15:39.705
- ...Voluptuary.
- Voluptuary.

15:40.705 --> 15:43.545
Racy go for a numbers man,
I'd have thought.

15:45.306 --> 15:47.744
I'm writing a paper on Edwardian erotica.

15:48.203 --> 15:49.704
It's very popular.

15:49.705 --> 15:51.705
Well-thumbed, I'm sure.

15:52.705 --> 15:55.180
I'm more of a Holly Martins man myself.

15:55.181 --> 15:56.704
Each to their own.

15:56.705 --> 16:00.421
You've been in receipt
of some curiosities, I believe,

16:00.422 --> 16:01.705
in your pigeon hole.

16:02.705 --> 16:05.704
Time was, the discretion
of a porter could be relied upon.

16:05.705 --> 16:07.704
Not in my experience.

16:08.283 --> 16:11.385
- Rag week hi-jinks. Nothing more.
- Really?

16:12.405 --> 16:15.003
Seems a little late in the year
for a rag week, I'd have thought.

16:16.425 --> 16:19.424
Those who are responsible will be
found and disciplined, I'm sure.

16:19.705 --> 16:23.704
It's a college matter, nothing
for the police to get involved in.

16:24.003 --> 16:28.163
Well... if you change your mind,
you know where to reach us.

16:34.705 --> 16:38.704
That one's Aegar tipularius,
a species of prawn.

16:38.705 --> 16:39.904
Now extinct, of course.

16:39.905 --> 16:42.104
I lifted him myself on a walking holiday,

16:42.105 --> 16:43.704
in the long vac in '32.

16:43.705 --> 16:45.048
In Germany.

16:45.049 --> 16:47.076
Is that your field, Professor Burrowes?

16:47.077 --> 16:48.904
Ah, would that it were.
Would that it were.

16:48.905 --> 16:51.090
Alas, no. Geology is my line.

16:51.091 --> 16:54.203
The fossils are an adjunct, I suppose.

16:54.204 --> 16:57.384
My particular delight is postage stamps.

16:57.385 --> 16:58.705
Philately.

16:59.705 --> 17:04.064
Er... this is about poor Mr Page, is it?

17:04.065 --> 17:06.363
- You've heard.
- I have, yes.

17:07.224 --> 17:08.704
Terrible thing. Absolutely terrible.

17:08.704 --> 17:11.223
What is it you were doing at the library?

17:11.223 --> 17:14.704
Oh, I'd been asked to evaluate
a number of items, erm... letters,

17:14.704 --> 17:17.704
historical documents and, er...
a vast stamp collection,

17:17.704 --> 17:20.704
left to the college
by the late Mr Teagarden.

17:20.704 --> 17:22.544
And is it valuable?

17:22.545 --> 17:24.704
One or two of the stamps are of interest,

17:24.704 --> 17:26.704
on the letters, oddly enough,

17:26.704 --> 17:29.384
but, er... nothing spectacular
in the main collection.

17:29.385 --> 17:31.704
And you left the library at what time?

17:31.705 --> 17:33.704
Oh, about the ten-minute bell.

17:33.705 --> 17:35.544
Ten to seven or so.

17:35.545 --> 17:38.704
- Anybody see you leave?
- The other readers, I suppose.

17:38.705 --> 17:41.704
I stopped off at my rooms
at the college and then came home.

17:41.705 --> 17:42.904
Anybody see you at college?

17:42.905 --> 17:45.486
Mr Jenkins, the porter, was on duty.

17:45.487 --> 17:46.705
And here?

17:46.706 --> 17:48.704
Ah, well, I live alone.

17:48.705 --> 17:53.003
I'm a confirmed bachelor.
Yet another old fossil.

17:53.745 --> 17:55.705
You and me both, Professor.

17:56.545 --> 17:58.704
I've just had another
three calls from residents.

17:58.705 --> 18:01.705
- This is getting ridiculous.
- Off to save the world, Viv?

18:02.705 --> 18:03.744
When are you going to do something

18:03.745 --> 18:05.704
about the complaints at Cranmer House?

18:05.705 --> 18:07.224
It's in hand.

18:07.225 --> 18:10.704
With respect, Councillor Burkitt,
that's what we were told last month.

18:10.705 --> 18:12.323
Miss Thursday, my junior.

18:13.065 --> 18:14.704
I see you're training her up well.

18:14.705 --> 18:16.704
It's not so funny
if you actually live there.

18:16.705 --> 18:19.704
"Homes fit for habitation."
That was your election promise.

18:19.705 --> 18:22.704
And I stand by it. Every word.

18:22.705 --> 18:23.705
I'll look into it.

18:23.706 --> 18:25.203
Miss Lansbury, make a note.

18:25.705 --> 18:28.745
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm late for the chamber.

18:30.705 --> 18:32.705
Sandra?

18:34.945 --> 18:36.945
Have you washed your hands?

18:38.451 --> 18:40.451
- How are you feeling?
- A bit better.

18:42.705 --> 18:45.083
Go on, then. I've made you some soup.

18:50.705 --> 18:52.705
Mum, it's happening again.

18:54.065 --> 18:55.803
Right. Come on.

19:10.705 --> 19:12.963
Disturbance, Cranmer House.

19:15.545 --> 19:17.705
- What kind of disturbance?
- I don't know.

19:18.339 --> 19:20.224
There's been multiple calls
from residents.

19:20.225 --> 19:22.705
Look, you can be there and back
in 40 minutes. The guv'nor asked.

19:23.705 --> 19:24.705
Right.

19:46.545 --> 19:47.704
RUMBLING What was that?

19:47.705 --> 19:49.544
Did you feel that?

19:49.545 --> 19:50.704
I felt it.

19:50.705 --> 19:52.704
What's happening? Mum, what's going on.

19:52.705 --> 19:53.705
Why are the lights doing that?

19:53.706 --> 19:55.224
I don't know. Right, we need to go.

19:56.705 --> 19:58.544
We need to go. Come on, let's run. OK.

19:58.545 --> 19:59.744
Let's go. Hold on to Mummy, that's right.

19:59.745 --> 20:01.704
Let's go. Come on, Come on, darling.

20:01.705 --> 20:03.003
Let's run. Come on, it's OK.

20:13.229 --> 20:15.704
Morse to information room.
All units to Cranmer House!

20:16.706 --> 20:18.705
We're OK, let's go, let's go!

20:23.705 --> 20:25.179
This way. This way. This way.

20:25.180 --> 20:27.744
It's OK. It's OK.
Everything's gonna be OK now.

20:27.745 --> 20:30.705
OK, darling. Keep going. Keep going.

20:33.745 --> 20:35.385
- Mum!
- Sandra, run!

20:55.705 --> 20:57.705
HIGH-PITCHED RINGING

22:00.945 --> 22:01.945
Jesus.

22:05.945 --> 22:06.945
What do we do?

22:07.945 --> 22:09.464
Where do we start?

22:09.465 --> 22:11.944
Fire and ambulance are coming
from across the county.

22:11.945 --> 22:14.204
- Relief are turning in.
- What happened?

22:14.205 --> 22:16.268
What happened is immaterial
for the moment.

22:16.269 --> 22:18.262
All that matters now
is the preservation of life.

22:18.262 --> 22:19.435
You think anyone could've survived that?

22:19.460 --> 22:22.621
I don't know. But if they did,
it's up to us to get them out.

22:23.472 --> 22:25.123
Castle Gate! Where are my officers?

22:26.782 --> 22:28.621
Very good. Williams, Benson, Davis.

22:28.622 --> 22:31.261
- Let's get a human chain organised, yes?
- Yes, sir.

22:31.262 --> 22:32.621
Start clearing some of this rubble.

22:32.622 --> 22:34.346
But mind how you go, I don't
want any more casualties.

22:34.371 --> 22:35.426
Yes, sir.

23:06.056 --> 23:08.261
The accident appears
to have happened without warning.

23:08.262 --> 23:10.461
One side of the building
has sheared away from the rest.

23:11.163 --> 23:14.101
The total number
of casualties is not yet known.

23:14.102 --> 23:16.661
Had the collapse happened
during the hours of darkness,

23:16.662 --> 23:17.941
one can be certain

23:17.942 --> 23:20.261
that the death toll would have been
very much higher.

23:20.865 --> 23:21.977
Her Majesty the Queen

23:21.978 --> 23:24.403
has sent a message of sympathy
to the bereaved.

23:40.803 --> 23:42.262
We should clear out.

23:43.472 --> 23:45.471
Leave it to uniform.
There's nothing we can do.

23:45.472 --> 23:46.723
We can be here.

23:47.472 --> 23:50.472
I can be here. One of us should...

23:52.818 --> 23:54.818
...to help with identification.

23:56.865 --> 23:57.905
Whatever you think.

24:01.312 --> 24:03.363
Put that bloody cigarette out!

24:14.157 --> 24:15.744
One at a time. Yes, Miss Frazil.

24:15.745 --> 24:17.043
How can this happen?

24:17.044 --> 24:18.851
Cranmer House
hasn't been standing a year.

24:18.852 --> 24:21.471
There's talk of an explosion
on one of the lower floors.

24:21.472 --> 24:23.179
An explosion? Even so...

24:23.180 --> 24:25.198
The borough engineer, the chief surveyor.

24:25.199 --> 24:27.471
All of the departments
with a responsibility

24:27.472 --> 24:30.471
and an interest in what's happened
today are already at work.

24:30.472 --> 24:31.750
- Was it built using...
- The last thing we need

24:31.751 --> 24:33.624
- is people jumping to conclusions.
- Yes, but...

24:34.217 --> 24:36.471
There will be a thorough investigation,

24:36.472 --> 24:39.471
and we will leave no stone unturned
to get to the bottom of it.

24:39.472 --> 24:40.996
Now, thank you,
I'm sure you'll understand

24:40.997 --> 24:43.472
I've much to attend to.
Thank you. Thank you.

24:58.472 --> 25:00.119
I wanted to see if she was all right.

25:00.847 --> 25:01.773
How is she?

25:02.814 --> 25:06.472
- How's her mum?
- Hanging in there.

25:08.472 --> 25:11.223
- You should be home.
- Home.

25:11.963 --> 25:13.471
So should she.

25:13.763 --> 25:15.472
So should her mother. So should everyone.

25:16.305 --> 25:18.523
- Accidents happen.
- Yeah, not like this.

25:19.472 --> 25:21.472
You know, somebody's
got to be responsible.

25:26.473 --> 25:27.831
Is there anything I can do?

25:28.523 --> 25:31.323
You've done your bit... and more.

25:36.652 --> 25:37.652
Good night.

25:38.878 --> 25:40.238
Good night.

25:47.843 --> 25:51.471
- Dulcie?
- No. It. It's me.

25:52.483 --> 25:54.311
- Puli?
- That's right.

25:54.312 --> 25:57.933
- Oh, I thought you were Dulcie!
- I know.

25:57.934 --> 25:59.963
I must have been dreaming.

26:03.685 --> 26:04.685
You weren't there.

26:05.472 --> 26:06.831
Why weren't you there?

26:07.238 --> 26:08.878
I was up country.

26:10.472 --> 26:11.883
I needed you.

26:12.745 --> 26:13.745
I know.

26:14.472 --> 26:15.991
But you didn't come.

26:15.992 --> 26:17.471
Why didn't you come?

26:17.472 --> 26:20.471
I came as soon as word reached me.

26:20.878 --> 26:21.878
Too late.

26:24.044 --> 26:25.831
You were always too late.

26:26.405 --> 26:28.045
Try to rest, hm?

26:32.225 --> 26:34.384
Right. Stand to.

26:34.409 --> 26:36.408
Word from Bottoms is life goes on.

26:36.772 --> 26:38.292
Business as usual, everyone.

26:39.472 --> 26:42.471
So, where are we
on this Bodleian inquiry?

26:42.472 --> 26:43.671
Morse?

26:43.672 --> 26:47.311
Erm... deceased is an Osbert Page.

26:47.312 --> 26:49.166
Senior librarian at the Bodleian.

26:49.167 --> 26:52.471
Murder weapon was a wood chisel,
found in situ, no fingerprints.

26:52.472 --> 26:55.471
Oh, the interesting thing was muddy
boot prints found at the locus,

26:55.472 --> 26:57.740
and leading away from the body.

26:57.741 --> 26:59.133
They're with forensics.

26:59.134 --> 27:00.471
Anything in the way of motive?

27:01.003 --> 27:03.311
Page's flat was turned over, sir,

27:03.312 --> 27:04.511
but as to what they were looking for...

27:04.512 --> 27:06.471
There was a map of the Gower Peninsula

27:06.472 --> 27:08.471
with one or two things written on it.

27:08.472 --> 27:09.472
Page was a rambler.

27:09.473 --> 27:11.254
- What was on the map?
- "HB".

27:11.255 --> 27:12.471
And something in Greek.

27:12.472 --> 27:13.840
"Anemoi".

27:13.841 --> 27:15.471
The wind gods, apparently.

27:15.472 --> 27:18.312
Well, I think we can probably
leave them off the suspects roster.

27:19.152 --> 27:21.877
Speaking of which, couple
of academics, wasn't it, you said?

27:21.878 --> 27:23.754
That's right, Dr Nicholson
and Professor Burrowes,

27:23.755 --> 27:26.151
both at Garstang College,
neither of whom have an alibi.

27:26.152 --> 27:28.702
Well, keep at it. Be nice to have
a result to throw at division

27:28.703 --> 27:29.843
for the quarterlies.

27:31.992 --> 27:34.976
That junior librarian, Miss Paroo, rang.

27:34.977 --> 27:36.744
She's got that list of
books you were after.

27:36.769 --> 27:37.709
Right.

27:37.710 --> 27:39.367
I've one or two errands to run.
Can you deal?

27:39.368 --> 27:40.569
- Yeah, of course.
- Keep me posted.

27:40.594 --> 27:41.595
Will do.

27:46.052 --> 27:47.251
You all right?

27:47.511 --> 27:48.831
Yes.

27:49.472 --> 27:51.151
You had a bad go yesterday.

27:51.152 --> 27:52.763
Well, there's many had it worse.

27:53.571 --> 27:54.571
All the same.

27:57.472 --> 27:59.471
Why don't you sign yourself off
for a few days?

27:59.472 --> 28:01.471
I can take up the slack with himself.

28:01.472 --> 28:03.471
I think now is hardly the time.

28:03.472 --> 28:06.038
Well, if you change your mind.

28:06.039 --> 28:07.672
I'd sooner be busy. Thank you.

28:20.152 --> 28:21.471
Hello.

28:21.472 --> 28:23.471
- Hi.
- I believe you've that list of books

28:23.472 --> 28:25.471
that Dr Nicholson requested
from the Phi Collection.

28:25.472 --> 28:28.152
Oh, yes. Yes.

28:29.472 --> 28:31.471
- Thank you.
- Afraid they're rather of a piece.

28:31.472 --> 28:32.768
Antique smut.

28:32.769 --> 28:34.471
Mr Page was not best pleased.

28:35.163 --> 28:37.843
He often took the professor
to task about it.

28:38.472 --> 28:41.471
However, it was nothing beside his run-in

28:41.472 --> 28:42.642
with Professor Burrowes the other week.

28:42.667 --> 28:43.687
What run-in?

28:43.688 --> 28:46.471
Something to do with this donation,
or whatever it is,

28:46.472 --> 28:48.471
from the Teagarden family, I believe.

28:48.472 --> 28:51.603
The professor and Mr Page
had a blazing row about it.

28:52.599 --> 28:54.759
Well, if you do come across it
I'd be grateful to see it.

28:55.472 --> 28:56.472
Of course.

28:58.003 --> 29:00.511
Oh, excuse me, sir.
Is Professor Burrowes in today?

29:00.512 --> 29:03.471
- Luncheoning out, I believe, sir.
- Oh.

29:03.472 --> 29:05.471
What about Dr Nicholson, is he in?

29:05.472 --> 29:07.206
Oh, just missed him, sir.

29:07.207 --> 29:10.906
But, erm... I see the fun and games
I told you about is still going on.

29:10.907 --> 29:11.986
How's that?

29:12.472 --> 29:14.831
Another message just delivered
to his cubby, sir.

29:15.351 --> 29:16.991
Delivered by whom?

29:17.683 --> 29:19.471
Person or persons unknown,

29:19.472 --> 29:21.151
I believe that's the phrase, isn't it?

29:21.152 --> 29:22.471
I didn't see.

29:22.472 --> 29:24.311
Arrived when I was about my business.

29:25.138 --> 29:26.265
Well, can I see it?

29:27.018 --> 29:28.658
Yes, of course, sir.

29:34.992 --> 29:36.471
There we are.

29:36.472 --> 29:37.472
Thank you.

29:44.472 --> 29:46.831
Right, well, I'll keep hold of that,
thank you.

29:46.832 --> 29:49.227
Oh, very well, sir. If you say so.
I'll let Dr Nicholson know.

29:49.228 --> 29:50.742
I'll let him know myself when I see him.

29:50.743 --> 29:54.471
Oh, very good. Oh, erm... you found
Professor Burrowes at home

29:54.472 --> 29:56.471
- all right yesterday, did you?
- Oh, I did, yes. Thank you.

29:56.472 --> 29:58.471
- Nice old man, isn't he?
- He is, yes.

29:58.472 --> 30:01.471
One of my favourites,
if a porter's allowed such a thing.

30:01.472 --> 30:03.138
He's always been very respectful.

30:03.558 --> 30:05.403
Not like some I could name.

30:06.643 --> 30:08.511
You wouldn't think
to look at him now, sir,

30:08.512 --> 30:11.472
but, erm... he was quite a cad
in his day.

30:12.803 --> 30:15.948
Oh, but I suppose life
takes it out of the best of us.

30:15.973 --> 30:16.973
Dismay.

30:16.998 --> 30:17.998
How's that?

30:18.023 --> 30:23.472
Same as most men, I suppose, sir.
Some girl he had hopes of.

30:33.472 --> 30:34.472
Miss Teagarden.

30:34.473 --> 30:36.471
Detective Sergeant Morse. Thames Valley.

30:36.472 --> 30:38.126
Of course. Come in.

30:38.127 --> 30:39.472
My condolences.

30:40.198 --> 30:42.043
Thank you for seeing me
at such short notice.

30:47.472 --> 30:49.151
Have you any idea what's in the bequest?

30:49.152 --> 30:51.471
Oh, anything and everything.

30:51.472 --> 30:53.471
Grandfather was something of a polymath.

30:53.472 --> 30:56.163
His papers, stamp collections, letters.

30:56.472 --> 30:58.986
But he didn't leave behind a list
or anything.

30:58.987 --> 31:01.471
Really, because there's been mention
made of an inventory.

31:01.472 --> 31:02.472
Not that I know of.

31:02.473 --> 31:06.203
I can only assume it's been compiled
by those examining the collection.

31:06.472 --> 31:08.948
Teagarden. Unusual name.

31:08.949 --> 31:10.991
Should have been Treegarden or Orchard.

31:10.992 --> 31:14.471
Baumgarten, only the
immigration official misheard.

31:14.472 --> 31:16.471
So, your family's German.

31:16.472 --> 31:17.472
Originally.

31:17.473 --> 31:20.803
My grandfather's side
came to England in 1911.

31:21.472 --> 31:25.311
- Is this him?
- No, that's his brother, Emil.

31:25.312 --> 31:28.471
He was a physicist
before the war in Berlin.

31:28.472 --> 31:30.803
Another Einstein, my grandfather said.

31:31.472 --> 31:35.472
A very great man...
or would have been, had he lived.

31:36.865 --> 31:37.865
A labour camp...

31:38.472 --> 31:41.151
...for the V2 factory in Mittelbau.

31:41.152 --> 31:42.511
The whole family.

31:42.512 --> 31:44.986
Emil... his wife...

31:44.987 --> 31:48.471
their daughter, Deborah,
for whom I'm named.

31:49.109 --> 31:50.234
Do you read Hebrew?

31:50.628 --> 31:51.865
A little.

31:54.472 --> 31:55.883
Have you any idea what...

31:57.472 --> 31:58.883
...this means?

32:01.472 --> 32:03.845
Emet means "truth". Why?

32:03.846 --> 32:05.861
Well, it just may have some bearing
on a case.

32:05.862 --> 32:07.472
What about this?

32:09.003 --> 32:11.471
"Mavet". Death.

32:12.043 --> 32:14.471
Reminds me of a story
my grandfather used to tell me

32:14.472 --> 32:15.991
when I was small.

32:16.723 --> 32:18.471
Do you know what a shem is?

32:19.163 --> 32:23.123
First word means "truth".
The second means "death".

32:25.472 --> 32:26.472
So?

32:26.923 --> 32:30.471
So, according to myth,
they're the "words of power"

32:30.472 --> 32:32.471
which, when placed in
the mouth of a golem, give it life.

32:32.472 --> 32:34.271
- A what now?
- A golem.

32:34.272 --> 32:35.944
According to Jewish folklore,

32:35.945 --> 32:38.803
it's a figure made of mud or clay,

32:38.804 --> 32:40.311
which will do its maker's bidding.

32:40.312 --> 32:41.471
So?

32:41.472 --> 32:44.471
There could be a link to the murder
at the Bodleian.

32:44.472 --> 32:46.956
What, you think a golem's
wandering around Oxford?

32:46.957 --> 32:49.991
No, of course I don't, but the
Porter at Garstang college did say

32:49.992 --> 32:53.542
that somebody left Dr Nicholson
a clay figure in his cubby hole.

32:53.543 --> 32:56.472
Right, you'd best follow it up.

32:58.043 --> 32:59.723
I'm afraid I can't help you.

33:00.472 --> 33:03.043
- I've no idea what they mean.
- Are you sure about that?

33:03.472 --> 33:05.471
We found one of them
in a waste-paper basket

33:05.472 --> 33:07.471
near to where you were sitting
in the Bodleian,

33:07.472 --> 33:09.883
and the other one
in your cubby hole here.

33:10.803 --> 33:12.603
I'm as much in the dark as you.

33:13.472 --> 33:16.181
Whoever left them must believe
they mean something to you.

33:17.472 --> 33:18.991
Well, then, they're wildly mistaken.

33:19.603 --> 33:21.671
I also believe there have been
things written on your blackboard

33:21.672 --> 33:22.991
during lectures.

33:23.243 --> 33:24.471
I don't recall.

33:25.323 --> 33:27.471
According to those present,
it was the word "Dora".

33:27.923 --> 33:30.323
- Does that mean anything to you?
- No.

33:31.312 --> 33:33.471
Really? Because the students
seemed to think,

33:33.472 --> 33:35.471
that you were rather distracted
by the word.

33:36.003 --> 33:37.471
Why should I be?

33:37.472 --> 33:39.471
I've never met anyone with that name.

33:39.923 --> 33:43.831
Really, I'm at a loss to see
the connection between these things

33:43.832 --> 33:46.472
and a stabbing at the Bodleian.

33:47.060 --> 33:49.991
- He's lying.
- Of course he is, but why?

33:50.433 --> 33:53.471
There's a connection
between Nicholson and Osbert Page.

33:53.472 --> 33:55.471
I'm just... I'm just not seeing it yet.

33:55.472 --> 33:57.471
You will when you're thinking
straight. You need some kip.

33:57.472 --> 34:00.243
I need a drink. Do you fancy one?

34:00.832 --> 34:02.471
Oh, I can't.

34:02.472 --> 34:03.472
It's been a while.

34:04.472 --> 34:06.152
I'm not much company these days.

34:07.725 --> 34:09.764
- Oh.
- Pick up sticks in the morning.

34:46.402 --> 34:47.983
All right, matey.

34:47.984 --> 34:50.984
Doctor. Sir. So, what couldn't wait?

34:52.539 --> 34:54.983
One of the bodies
recovered from the rubble.

34:54.984 --> 34:56.983
Male, 50s.

34:56.984 --> 34:58.984
Nothing to identify him.

34:59.580 --> 35:03.343
I have it from the fire brigade
that his remains were found

35:03.344 --> 35:05.023
in what would have been the basement.

35:05.673 --> 35:08.983
He did not die
in the collapse of Cranmer House.

35:08.984 --> 35:10.485
He was shot.

35:10.486 --> 35:12.983
Twice in the back. Hands bound.

35:13.843 --> 35:17.594
I'm afraid that's not
the worst of it. Doctor?

35:17.595 --> 35:21.983
There was concrete in the sinuses,
mouth, throat,

35:21.984 --> 35:26.183
oesophagus, and even
into the upper reaches of the lungs.

35:26.803 --> 35:29.666
He was buried alive, smothered,

35:29.667 --> 35:33.475
drowned in liquid concrete,
which then set.

35:33.475 --> 35:36.155
Bullets came from the same gun
that shot George Fancy.

35:37.475 --> 35:40.843
Whoever this is has been dead
for about a year...

35:41.475 --> 35:44.474
...encased in the foundations
of Cranmer House.

35:44.475 --> 35:47.283
- We need to put a name to him.
- Have you anything to go on?

35:48.155 --> 35:49.763
Just what's there.

35:51.723 --> 35:54.836
- Magdalen Cabs.
- Eddie Nero's old firm.

35:55.343 --> 35:58.474
The specs have come
from Dinkley's in the High,

35:58.475 --> 36:00.995
according to the name in the case.

36:02.475 --> 36:04.475
"HB"?

36:06.958 --> 36:07.958
Morse?

36:07.983 --> 36:10.514
We're looking into the death
of Osbert Page,

36:11.163 --> 36:12.474
Chief Librarian at the Bodleian.

36:12.475 --> 36:14.314
Stabbed to death there two nights ago.

36:14.315 --> 36:16.474
In his flat, there's a map of the Gower

36:16.475 --> 36:18.314
with the initials HB.

36:18.315 --> 36:21.807
Yes, I've just had the results
through from forensics.

36:22.183 --> 36:23.994
The muddy boot prints at the flat

36:23.995 --> 36:26.994
are consistent with those found
at the Bodleian.

36:26.995 --> 36:32.474
Clay, limestone and traces of fine sand.

36:32.475 --> 36:34.474
Sea sand, most likely,

36:34.475 --> 36:37.475
due to the roundness of the particles.

36:39.475 --> 36:41.474
Right, so, who else knows about this?

36:41.475 --> 36:43.842
So far, just us.

36:43.843 --> 36:45.474
Dr DeBryn was good enough

36:45.475 --> 36:48.929
to inform me and
Detective Sergeant Strange first.

36:48.930 --> 36:50.834
I think, for the moment, at least,

36:50.835 --> 36:55.674
such information should be contained
amongst former city officers.

36:56.363 --> 36:58.474
Well, then, we're a man shy, aren't we?

36:58.852 --> 37:00.043
Where is Thursday?

37:02.475 --> 37:03.834
No-one is suggesting

37:03.835 --> 37:06.474
Detective Inspector Thursday
has any involvement.

37:06.475 --> 37:07.966
Not for a moment.

37:07.967 --> 37:09.723
We just need to be sure of him.

37:10.315 --> 37:12.825
Word on the wire is
he's got pretty tight with Box.

37:12.826 --> 37:14.474
You've gotten pretty tight with the ACC.

37:14.475 --> 37:17.155
ACC Bottoms' probity
is not in question here.

37:31.475 --> 37:32.475
Out, is it?

37:33.209 --> 37:34.248
No, not tonight.

37:34.475 --> 37:35.515
Oh.

37:37.407 --> 37:38.407
I've seen someone...

37:41.123 --> 37:42.315
...a solicitor.

37:46.475 --> 37:47.475
Right.

37:47.923 --> 37:49.475
We can't go on this way.

37:51.475 --> 37:52.475
No.

37:52.476 --> 37:54.474
You in Sam's old room, me in ours.

37:54.475 --> 37:55.475
I never asked for that.

37:56.403 --> 37:57.475
No.

37:59.683 --> 38:01.474
Well, it's done now.

38:01.814 --> 38:02.814
Is it?

38:04.995 --> 38:06.475
I think so.

38:09.123 --> 38:10.475
Right.

38:12.247 --> 38:13.803
It doesn't have to be nasty.

38:14.781 --> 38:15.781
No.

38:18.475 --> 38:19.475
Him, is it?

38:20.047 --> 38:21.047
Him?

38:22.203 --> 38:24.403
Him up the ballroom. I followed you.

38:25.475 --> 38:29.155
No, Fred, it isn't him. It's you.

38:33.475 --> 38:35.474
- You keep the house.
- I don't want it.

38:35.475 --> 38:39.474
Any more than I wanted the oven...
or clothes, or a holiday.

38:39.475 --> 38:41.474
Then what do you want, Winifred?

38:41.475 --> 38:45.203
I wanted my husband back.
The man I married.

38:47.315 --> 38:51.043
I don't want the house
and I don't want the money.

38:52.203 --> 38:54.563
God knows what you had to do to get it.

38:57.155 --> 38:58.475
It was never about the money.

38:59.475 --> 39:00.475
We've been without before.

39:00.476 --> 39:01.763
It didn't matter.

39:04.995 --> 39:06.475
It never mattered.

39:09.475 --> 39:10.643
We had each other.

39:12.475 --> 39:13.475
Well...

39:16.043 --> 39:18.475
...just give me what you
want signing and I'll sign it.

39:20.475 --> 39:22.203
Is this Dinkley's Opticians?

39:23.475 --> 39:24.994
Detective Sergeant Morse, Thames Valley.

39:24.995 --> 39:27.154
I dropped a pair of spectacles in
this morning.

39:27.155 --> 39:29.474
Your receptionist said that
she would check the prescription

39:29.475 --> 39:32.475
against any of the patients you have
with the initials HB.

39:34.475 --> 39:35.475
Hollis...

39:37.815 --> 39:38.815
...Binks.

39:40.475 --> 39:42.474
He's missed two appointments? I see.

39:42.475 --> 39:44.883
And would you have an address
for Mr Binks?

40:02.228 --> 40:03.868
Hello?

40:45.835 --> 40:47.474
Did you get those figures?

40:47.475 --> 40:48.600
Have you seen Morse?

40:48.601 --> 40:50.093
He's not in his bunker.

40:50.094 --> 40:52.474
Oh, he left word.
He's pursuing inquiries.

40:52.475 --> 40:53.880
What inquiries?

40:53.881 --> 40:55.474
I don't know. He's your dog.

40:55.475 --> 40:57.742
He's nobody's dog. Yours nor mine.

40:58.323 --> 41:00.474
- I didn't mean...
- I don't care what you didn't mean.

41:00.475 --> 41:01.674
You'll treat your colleagues
with respect,

41:01.675 --> 41:05.474
- or I'll know why.
- All right. Don't bite my head off.

41:05.843 --> 41:07.154
I'm just saying he's...

41:07.155 --> 41:11.475
- Saying what?
- Well, he's not... one of us.

41:12.995 --> 41:14.675
Speaking of which...

41:18.235 --> 41:20.763
You're all right. We're all friends here.

41:23.301 --> 41:25.650
Where's it come from?
Seeing as we're all friends.

41:25.675 --> 41:28.027
- Why do you care?
- Say I do.

41:28.028 --> 41:29.723
It's just baksheesh...

41:30.763 --> 41:32.475
...for a blind eye turned.

41:35.581 --> 41:38.261
It's a bit late
to be on a conscience, Fred.

41:41.374 --> 41:42.862
Don't spend it all at once.

41:59.475 --> 42:03.154
Clive Burkitt.
Councillor, Planning and Housing.

42:03.155 --> 42:04.514
Detective Sergeant Morse. Thames Valley.

42:04.515 --> 42:07.474
I'm looking for any information
you could have on Hollis Binks.

42:07.475 --> 42:08.921
Hollis Binks?

42:08.922 --> 42:11.474
Erm... thank you, Miss Lansbury.

42:11.475 --> 42:13.474
Yeah, he's a borough surveyor here,
I believe.

42:13.475 --> 42:15.785
Oh, yes. Yes, he was.

42:15.786 --> 42:17.474
What is it you want to know about him?

42:17.475 --> 42:19.474
Well, what he did at the council,
when he left.

42:19.475 --> 42:21.314
Just what his duties might have involved.

42:21.315 --> 42:23.908
In connection with what?
He's not in any trouble, is he?

42:23.909 --> 42:26.474
Oh, no, no, just a general enquiry.

42:26.475 --> 42:30.119
Well, he, er...
he left about a year ago, I think.

42:30.120 --> 42:32.878
Tendered his resignation and, er...
and that was that.

42:32.879 --> 42:35.474
I think he found another position
in the North East.

42:35.475 --> 42:37.475
Well, I'd like to see it, please.

42:38.268 --> 42:41.267
- Sorry?
- His resignation letter.

42:41.835 --> 42:43.835
Presumably it's on file somewhere.

42:44.475 --> 42:47.155
Yeah, I know.
I would have thought so, yeah.

42:48.475 --> 42:50.474
Actually, do you know what?
This really isn't the best time.

42:50.475 --> 42:52.474
What, with, erm... everything.

42:52.475 --> 42:53.916
Do you think we could catch it up later?

42:53.917 --> 42:55.475
Ah, yes. Yes, of course.

42:56.475 --> 42:58.474
Any further idea
what happened at Cranmer?

42:58.803 --> 43:00.474
Gas.

43:00.475 --> 43:01.475
Right.

43:01.476 --> 43:04.154
Well, if you do dig out
Binks' resignation letter,

43:04.155 --> 43:06.475
- then I'd like to see it.
- Of course.

43:11.835 --> 43:13.994
Miss Thursday, Ms Wall.

43:13.995 --> 43:16.907
Morse, what are you up to?

43:16.908 --> 43:19.474
I'm just looking for some
information on a Hollis Binks,

43:19.475 --> 43:20.475
he was a borough surveyor here.

43:20.476 --> 43:22.263
Oh, don't know him, I'm afraid.

43:22.264 --> 43:24.925
I knew Hollis.
Been here years. Very thorough.

43:24.926 --> 43:26.891
He quit without notice about a year ago.

43:26.892 --> 43:28.921
- Without notice?
- Just up and left.

43:28.922 --> 43:31.154
Councillor Burkitt said that
he tendered his resignation.

43:31.155 --> 43:34.083
- First I've heard of it.
- Right.

43:34.475 --> 43:36.474
What's he like, Burkitt?

43:37.083 --> 43:39.474
No more slippery
than any other politician.

43:40.403 --> 43:43.978
Yet a lot said he'd never get
Martyrs' Field built,

43:43.979 --> 43:46.845
too expensive, but he proved them wrong.

43:46.846 --> 43:47.900
How's that?

43:47.901 --> 43:51.643
Put his money where his mouth is,
well, other people's money.

43:52.883 --> 43:55.474
His reputation was at stake.

43:55.475 --> 43:58.163
Made it part of his election pledge
in '64.

43:59.475 --> 44:00.763
Doubled his majority.

44:01.821 --> 44:02.821
Right.

44:03.843 --> 44:07.474
Best crack on. Be in the office, Joanie.

44:07.475 --> 44:08.723
- Thank you.
- Sergeant.

44:12.803 --> 44:14.474
How you getting on at Cranmer house?

44:15.740 --> 44:17.474
We've got people scattered all over town.

44:17.475 --> 44:19.474
Bed and breakfast, Sally Army.

44:19.790 --> 44:21.789
Even squeezed some into undergrad digs.

44:22.283 --> 44:23.956
It's not ideal long-term,

44:23.957 --> 44:27.789
but at least they're safe and dry
for the time being.

44:28.323 --> 44:29.519
How are things with you?

44:29.520 --> 44:32.790
Oh, one day's much the same as the next.

44:33.790 --> 44:36.789
I didn't mean work, I meant you.

44:36.790 --> 44:38.163
Oh, it's the same thing, isn't it?

44:39.428 --> 44:40.790
Have you seen your father lately?

44:41.203 --> 44:43.789
Not much. Why?

44:43.790 --> 44:45.789
Well, I just wondered
if he was all right.

44:45.790 --> 44:47.789
He hasn't seemed himself lately.

44:47.790 --> 44:48.790
Oh.

44:50.483 --> 44:53.203
Anyway, there it is. Er...

44:54.150 --> 44:55.523
...I'll...

45:03.790 --> 45:04.790
Bright.

45:04.791 --> 45:06.310
Good morning, Sir.

45:07.790 --> 45:11.083
Lunch. Yes, I'd be delighted.

45:12.496 --> 45:13.496
Of course.

45:16.790 --> 45:20.790
Shocking about Cranmer House,
those poor people.

45:21.790 --> 45:24.789
This is about Mr Page, is it?

45:24.790 --> 45:25.790
Well, partly.

45:25.791 --> 45:28.789
I believe you had a bit of a row
with him the other week

45:28.790 --> 45:30.149
about a misplaced inventory.

45:30.150 --> 45:32.789
Something to do with
the Teagarden donation, was it?

45:32.790 --> 45:35.469
Lost, not misplaced.

45:35.470 --> 45:37.790
I'm somewhat at sea without it.

45:38.436 --> 45:39.436
Er... please.

45:41.230 --> 45:42.390
And the other part?

45:43.489 --> 45:44.575
You said "partly".

45:44.576 --> 45:47.789
Yes. I wanted to ask you
about Hollis Binks.

45:47.790 --> 45:49.789
I believe you knew him.
Your name's in his address book.

45:49.790 --> 45:51.789
Yes, Hollis was a student of mine,

45:51.790 --> 45:54.789
and a fellow member of
the Happy Wanderers Walking Club.

45:54.790 --> 45:57.309
We did the
Santiago de Compostela together.

45:57.563 --> 45:59.043
A fine geologist.

45:59.589 --> 46:00.788
Did Page ever mention him?

46:00.990 --> 46:04.789
Not to me, no. Why?

46:04.790 --> 46:06.789
Only, his name was also
in Binks' address book.

46:06.790 --> 46:08.790
Oh, well...
presumably, they knew each other.

46:10.703 --> 46:12.703
The Gower Peninsula.

46:13.790 --> 46:15.789
Will that be a popular place for walkers?

46:15.790 --> 46:17.789
For everyone. Holidaymakers.

46:18.336 --> 46:19.536
Mm.

46:21.310 --> 46:23.789
When was the last time you saw him?
Binks?

46:23.790 --> 46:25.309
Oh, not for years.

46:25.310 --> 46:29.789
Erm... well, he wrote to me
about a year ago.

46:29.790 --> 46:32.836
About Faringdon sponge gravel.
Yes, that was it.

46:32.837 --> 46:33.917
What's that?

46:33.942 --> 46:36.629
It's part of the Greensand,
formed in the Cretaceous.

46:36.630 --> 46:38.192
And what did he want to know?

46:38.193 --> 46:41.789
If it was found
anywhere other than Wicklesham.

46:41.790 --> 46:44.015
It extends to Lower Coxwell and Fernham,

46:44.016 --> 46:46.789
but Wicklesham is the only place
where it's quarried.

46:46.790 --> 46:49.469
For aggregate, in the main.

46:49.470 --> 46:52.403
Lovely walking there,
if you're ever out that way.

46:55.003 --> 46:56.629
Follow me.

46:56.630 --> 46:57.990
Thank you.

47:04.790 --> 47:07.630
Ah, Reginald. Glad you could join us.

47:08.790 --> 47:10.789
You know Councillor Burkitt?

47:10.790 --> 47:12.257
No, I don't believe
I've had the pleasure.

47:12.258 --> 47:13.790
Chief Superintendent.

47:14.509 --> 47:15.962
Well, don't stand on ceremony.

47:15.963 --> 47:17.790
Take a pew and we'll get the orders in.

47:50.735 --> 47:54.214
There may come a time to dig
more deeply into Nero's activities,

47:54.215 --> 47:55.215
but the man is dead.

47:56.215 --> 47:57.678
One more death in his debit column

47:57.679 --> 48:00.214
will bring him no nearer
to facing justice.

48:00.215 --> 48:03.414
That's certainly the view
of senior officers at division.

48:03.415 --> 48:06.214
Few more senior than
the assistant chief constable,

48:06.215 --> 48:08.254
I wouldn't have thought.

48:08.255 --> 48:10.842
I'm merely relaying to you
certain operational matters

48:10.843 --> 48:12.735
as have been explained to me.

48:14.055 --> 48:17.054
There are things here that go
far beyond Oxford and Thames Valley.

48:17.079 --> 48:18.919
Best handled from London.

48:20.975 --> 48:25.067
Such operational matters concern the
councillor for housing and planning

48:25.092 --> 48:27.190
in what regard, may I ask?

48:27.215 --> 48:31.874
I'm here in a purely
advisory capacity, Reginald.

48:31.875 --> 48:33.866
A trouble-shooter, if you like.

48:33.867 --> 48:35.215
Oh, yes? I see.

48:36.895 --> 48:39.214
What trouble do you intend
to shoot today, Councillor?

48:39.215 --> 48:40.215
Not me, I hope.

48:41.801 --> 48:46.414
One of your colleagues from Cowley
has been concerning himself unduly

48:46.415 --> 48:49.643
with matters of a sensitive nature.

48:50.001 --> 48:53.214
Matters with, erm...
potential ramifications

48:53.215 --> 48:56.214
for some departments of local government.

48:56.215 --> 49:02.215
Morse, is it? His enthusiasm
is commendable, but misplaced.

49:03.215 --> 49:04.894
I'm in Traffic, sir.

49:04.895 --> 49:08.214
I don't see how I can bring
any influence to bear upon him.

49:08.215 --> 49:11.214
Well, that brings me to my second point.

49:11.215 --> 49:13.214
It seems a fearful waste of resources

49:13.215 --> 49:15.414
to have an officer
of your experience and ability

49:15.415 --> 49:17.214
closed away in Traffic.

49:17.215 --> 49:20.214
There's no need to be coy.

49:20.215 --> 49:21.603
We're all men here.

49:22.802 --> 49:25.801
ACC Bottoms is moving to the Met
next year,

49:26.135 --> 49:28.134
which will leave a vacancy
up at division.

49:28.159 --> 49:30.838
It would be a fine way
to finish one's service.

49:30.863 --> 49:34.570
And some much-needed good news
for your wife, I'm sure.

49:34.603 --> 49:36.215
My wife?

49:37.588 --> 49:38.908
I may have mentioned.

49:41.795 --> 49:43.595
Excuse me, sir...

49:46.735 --> 49:48.735
...I have a previous
appointment elsewhere.

49:49.621 --> 49:50.941
Councillor.

50:00.890 --> 50:04.214
Erm... I have a friend
at the Royal Masonic.

50:04.215 --> 50:07.432
Some new experimental cancer
treatments are being looked at

50:07.433 --> 50:09.214
out of America.

50:09.215 --> 50:12.734
A shortlist of patients
suitable to take part in the trial

50:13.089 --> 50:14.569
is being drawn up.

50:16.735 --> 50:18.215
I see.

50:19.215 --> 50:22.363
If you change your mind...
What are friends for?

50:25.255 --> 50:27.403
We are not friends, Councillor...

50:28.728 --> 50:31.563
...nor, I'm very happy to say,
are we ever likely to be.

50:42.935 --> 50:43.935
You all right?

50:45.415 --> 50:47.215
Kids, Morse.

50:48.215 --> 50:49.763
Women and children.

50:51.215 --> 50:53.215
Families destroyed.

50:57.215 --> 50:59.214
When they tore down the Oxpens slums,

50:59.215 --> 51:00.773
it was meant to be a fresh start.

51:00.774 --> 51:02.215
A brave new world.

51:02.216 --> 51:04.215
Safe and clean and...

51:06.575 --> 51:08.215
...how does it end like this?

51:09.069 --> 51:10.108
A gas leak.

51:10.523 --> 51:12.734
Isn't that the official line?

51:12.735 --> 51:14.215
Official lie.

51:15.415 --> 51:18.574
We're talking about
a catastrophic structural failure.

51:18.575 --> 51:20.214
Gas explosion or no,

51:20.215 --> 51:22.643
they're supposed to withstand
anything like that. It's the law.

51:23.215 --> 51:25.415
Well, people have been known
to break the law.

51:28.215 --> 51:30.215
What do you make to Burkitt?

51:32.668 --> 51:35.147
Martyrs' Field's got his name
all over it, it's his legacy.

51:35.172 --> 51:37.171
He's hardly likely to jeopardise that.

51:37.215 --> 51:38.574
Is that what you wanted to ask me?

51:38.575 --> 51:40.214
In part. I'm more interested

51:40.215 --> 51:42.843
in anything you can tell me
about Four Winds Aggregate.

51:43.148 --> 51:44.148
- Out at Wicklesham?
- Mm-hm.

51:44.173 --> 51:46.483
George McGyffin's old firm. One of them.

51:47.115 --> 51:49.114
He's yards and works all over.

51:49.215 --> 51:50.215
Here. Somerset.

51:50.216 --> 51:53.214
Some sea-dredging firm in Wales.

51:53.215 --> 51:56.214
And he supplied materials
for your new divisional HQ.

51:56.215 --> 51:57.443
Really?

51:59.142 --> 52:01.141
Has he anything to do with Cranmer house?

52:01.166 --> 52:04.238
They had a contract
on the concrete side, I think.

52:04.263 --> 52:06.710
Out of the council,
before it closed down.

52:08.215 --> 52:09.215
Right.

52:11.575 --> 52:13.574
And what about a Hollis Binks?

52:14.243 --> 52:17.215
He was a borough surveyor
up until about a year ago.

52:17.801 --> 52:20.214
No. No, I've not come across him. Why?

52:20.215 --> 52:23.214
This librarian, Page, at the Bodleian,

52:23.215 --> 52:24.734
stabbed to death.

52:25.163 --> 52:27.603
You think that's connected
to what's happened here?

52:29.215 --> 52:31.214
I don't know. Possibly.

52:31.602 --> 52:33.602
I'm just poking around.

52:34.215 --> 52:37.215
- Who knows?
- Someone knows.

52:43.215 --> 52:45.214
The first time I saw her, she was 19.

52:45.215 --> 52:48.683
I was... not much more.

52:50.215 --> 52:54.215
The governor's house. A garden party.

52:55.215 --> 52:57.215
Me and Win, it was the Palais.

52:58.793 --> 53:01.215
Her father was something
in the Colonial Service.

53:02.215 --> 53:05.215
Win's old man worked the docks.
Limehouse Basin.

53:05.655 --> 53:07.215
Thought I might not be too welcome,

53:07.216 --> 53:09.215
being a young copper,
but he was a straight go.

53:10.643 --> 53:13.603
The sky was pink and pearl, band playing.

53:15.215 --> 53:17.574
Geraldo, I think it was, for us.

53:17.575 --> 53:20.214
The crowd parted
for the briefest moment and...

53:20.215 --> 53:23.215
There she was, pretty as a picture.

53:24.505 --> 53:27.214
Surrounded by all these dashing types,

53:27.215 --> 53:29.214
desperate to light her cigarette.

53:29.215 --> 53:32.215
Next thing, I'd crossed the lawn,
I was standing beside her.

53:32.772 --> 53:35.215
"Have you come to save me?" She said.

53:37.255 --> 53:41.643
"Yes", I said... "I rather think I have."

53:47.215 --> 53:48.575
And now I can't.

53:51.215 --> 53:54.734
You've a works along the Gower,
I understand. Sea dredging.

53:54.735 --> 53:56.214
Nash Bank. What of it?

53:56.215 --> 53:58.214
Did Hollis Binks ever go there?

53:58.215 --> 53:59.215
Who?

53:59.216 --> 54:01.215
Hollis Binks, he was a borough surveyor.

54:01.921 --> 54:02.921
No.

54:03.216 --> 54:04.857
Really? That's a surprise.

54:04.858 --> 54:06.800
As he seemed to have had an interest
in your company

54:06.801 --> 54:08.215
Four Winds Aggregate.

54:11.887 --> 54:12.973
You supplied the concrete

54:12.974 --> 54:14.643
for the Martyrs' Field
development, didn't you?

54:15.215 --> 54:17.214
What did you say your name was?

54:17.215 --> 54:19.214
Detective Sergeant Morse, Thames Valley.

54:19.215 --> 54:21.214
Well, Detective Sergeant Morse,
Thames Valley,

54:21.215 --> 54:22.215
let me tell you something.

54:22.963 --> 54:26.018
Construction site's no place
for small boys with soft hands

54:26.019 --> 54:27.215
and clean shirts.

54:27.883 --> 54:29.214
It's dirty work.

54:29.215 --> 54:32.215
Dangerous work. Man's work.

54:33.388 --> 54:34.603
Accidents happen.

54:35.215 --> 54:36.575
That sounds like a threat.

54:37.975 --> 54:39.123
Advice, son.

54:40.215 --> 54:41.683
You ever seen a shovel fight?

54:42.403 --> 54:45.215
That's how navvies used to
settle their differences on site.

54:46.208 --> 54:48.385
I once seen two brothers
go at each other with shovels.

54:48.410 --> 54:50.843
20 minutes, it lasted. Hell of a thing.

54:51.215 --> 54:53.055
Oh-oh-oh, and the noise!

54:54.135 --> 54:56.134
Only finished when one of them
took the other one's arm off

54:56.159 --> 54:57.159
at the shoulder.

54:58.215 --> 54:59.843
Go home.

55:00.215 --> 55:04.214
Go on, go home, forget about
Hollis Binks and Four Winds.

55:04.215 --> 55:06.214
I'm afraid I can't do that, Mr McGyffin.

55:06.215 --> 55:07.215
That's too bad.

55:08.443 --> 55:10.214
Boys'll show you safe back to your car.

55:10.215 --> 55:12.415
It's all right, I can manage.

55:49.215 --> 55:50.215
Bloody hell.

56:14.408 --> 56:15.768
Any news?

56:17.895 --> 56:21.215
I had a dig around
for this gun used on George.

56:23.068 --> 56:25.067
We've been looking in the wrong place.

56:25.215 --> 56:29.214
It was used in a wages snatch
in '64 in Reading.

56:29.215 --> 56:32.443
Amongst the investigating officers
was a DS Ronnie Box.

56:33.215 --> 56:34.254
Then we've got him.

56:34.255 --> 56:37.214
Well, if we're going to move
against him, it's got to be solid.

56:37.215 --> 56:40.214
We're accusing him of killing
a fellow police officer.

56:40.215 --> 56:42.215
Depending how far this goes,
we get one shot.

56:43.215 --> 56:44.443
It's gotta stick.

56:44.861 --> 56:46.083
What's that, Jim?

56:46.961 --> 56:50.160
Oh, er... just popped in to see Morse.

56:50.415 --> 56:52.214
Is that right?

56:52.215 --> 56:56.523
Well, you've got business.
I won't keep you.

56:57.215 --> 56:58.215
Sir.

57:04.689 --> 57:08.008
- Where'd you get to?
- Oh, something came up.

57:08.215 --> 57:11.214
Pursuing inquiries, DS Jago said.
What inquiries?

57:11.448 --> 57:13.448
Oh, it's nothing, probably.

57:15.215 --> 57:19.214
The guv'nor was asking about
an unknown out at Cranmer House.

57:19.643 --> 57:21.214
Said you'd know about it.

57:21.501 --> 57:24.501
What is it, something off the books?

57:26.501 --> 57:29.123
He said all the old Cowley firm
knew about him.

57:31.115 --> 57:32.115
I don't.

57:43.895 --> 57:45.215
Morse.

57:46.735 --> 57:48.443
Ah, Miss Teagarden. Good afternoon.

57:50.415 --> 57:52.215
Yes, in about half an hour?

57:54.069 --> 57:55.589
Very well. Until then. Thank you.

57:58.895 --> 58:00.214
It's come down from division.

58:00.215 --> 58:03.214
Whatever you're about,
they want to pass it to the Yard.

58:03.803 --> 58:05.215
I can't help them.

58:05.942 --> 58:07.683
Come on. We can talk straight.

58:09.215 --> 58:10.254
Can we?

58:10.255 --> 58:11.756
Course. This is you and me.

58:11.757 --> 58:13.243
Doesn't feel that way.

58:14.215 --> 58:16.735
In fact, it hasn't felt that way
since I got to Castle Gate.

58:17.735 --> 58:19.214
Feels more like you and Box.

58:19.215 --> 58:22.894
No, that's fine. Things change.

58:22.895 --> 58:24.214
You don't owe me anything,

58:24.215 --> 58:27.214
but I don't owe him anything either.

58:27.215 --> 58:29.215
Certainly not loyalty.

58:29.881 --> 58:32.881
He's not my guv'nor, never will be.

58:38.215 --> 58:40.215
You know, there is a line.

58:40.748 --> 58:42.748
I just hope that you're
on the right side of it.

59:06.215 --> 59:08.215
It's all there. Every penny.

59:09.215 --> 59:10.215
I don't get it.

59:10.535 --> 59:11.574
What's to get?

59:12.575 --> 59:15.214
I had a mad half-hour, that's all.
It's over.

59:15.215 --> 59:19.215
Have a drink.
You're not thinking straight.

59:19.908 --> 59:22.747
I'm thinking straight
for the first time in a long while.

59:23.055 --> 59:25.214
Maybe for the first time
since George Fancy.

59:25.215 --> 59:26.723
Fancy?

59:27.215 --> 59:29.215
That's what's got you by the tail?

59:29.915 --> 59:33.203
- It's nothing to do with this.
- He's everything to do with it.

59:35.215 --> 59:37.214
He stood for something.

59:37.215 --> 59:39.214
I take this, I might as well
piss on his grave.

59:39.215 --> 59:40.323
Look...

59:40.735 --> 59:43.323
there's no comeback,
if that's what you're worried about.

59:44.702 --> 59:46.021
It's bent.

59:46.215 --> 59:47.643
The world's bent.

59:48.215 --> 59:51.214
Always has been. We can't fix it.

59:51.763 --> 59:53.214
We can try.

59:53.215 --> 59:58.215
Everybody else dips their beak
for a sight less than us.

01:00:00.215 --> 01:00:01.577
Protection money?

01:00:01.578 --> 01:00:04.214
Yeah. We protect people.

01:00:04.215 --> 01:00:05.632
Every time we turn out.

01:00:05.633 --> 01:00:07.215
Cos it's our job.

01:00:08.215 --> 01:00:10.215
Not for this. Not for a kick-back.

01:00:10.617 --> 01:00:13.575
- Makes us no different to Eddie Nero.
- We are no different!

01:00:15.886 --> 01:00:17.603
There are two kinds of people, Fred.

01:00:18.758 --> 01:00:20.215
Those who take...

01:00:21.215 --> 01:00:23.055
...and them that get taken.

01:00:24.215 --> 01:00:25.574
I know what side I'm on.

01:00:25.843 --> 01:00:28.883
So do I. I always have done.

01:00:30.215 --> 01:00:32.055
It slipped my mind.

01:00:33.215 --> 01:00:36.215
I thought I was owed. I was wrong.

01:00:36.922 --> 01:00:38.563
This job doesn't owe me anything.

01:00:40.988 --> 01:00:42.283
So, I'm giving it back.

01:00:44.255 --> 01:00:45.850
It doesn't work like that.

01:00:45.851 --> 01:00:47.523
It works how I say it does.

01:00:49.255 --> 01:00:51.255
How you live your life is your business.

01:00:52.943 --> 01:00:54.215
You don't have to worry about me.

01:00:54.216 --> 01:00:56.214
I'm putting in for a transfer.

01:00:56.215 --> 01:00:57.895
I'll be out of your hair.

01:00:59.215 --> 01:01:00.895
Mind how you go.

01:01:11.021 --> 01:01:14.054
I was closing up the house when
I came across a bundle of letters

01:01:14.055 --> 01:01:16.340
at the back of my grandfather's
writing desk.

01:01:16.341 --> 01:01:18.340
Well, photostats.

01:01:18.341 --> 01:01:21.860
The originals, I imagine, went with
the rest of the bequest materials.

01:01:21.861 --> 01:01:23.340
To Garstang College?

01:01:23.341 --> 01:01:26.463
At first, I thought my grandfather
must have kept them for the stamp,

01:01:26.464 --> 01:01:29.180
they were from Oslo, from a friend there,

01:01:29.181 --> 01:01:31.340
but I couldn't see
why he would have made copies

01:01:31.341 --> 01:01:33.443
if it was just the stamp
he was interested in.

01:01:34.181 --> 01:01:35.546
Do you read German?

01:01:35.547 --> 01:01:37.340
Er... no. No, I'm afraid not.

01:01:37.341 --> 01:01:40.340
They're about my
Great Uncle Emil and his family.

01:01:40.341 --> 01:01:42.168
- Emil, scientist?
- A physicist.

01:01:42.169 --> 01:01:43.308
Physicist, sorry.

01:01:43.309 --> 01:01:45.334
He was part of the Meitner-Hahn
group in Berlin,

01:01:45.335 --> 01:01:47.154
researching heavy elements,

01:01:47.155 --> 01:01:48.816
but with the passing of the Race Laws,

01:01:48.817 --> 01:01:51.020
things became impossible for him.

01:01:51.403 --> 01:01:53.340
I don't doubt it.

01:01:53.341 --> 01:01:56.340
Many of his colleagues fled Germany,
but he was a patriot.

01:01:56.341 --> 01:01:59.340
Afraid his work might fall
into the wrong hands,

01:01:59.341 --> 01:02:01.860
he smuggled his notebooks out of Germany

01:02:01.861 --> 01:02:04.340
to someone he met
while lecturing at Oxford.

01:02:04.341 --> 01:02:07.341
Someone he later came to believe
had betrayed him.

01:02:10.563 --> 01:02:11.803
Right.

01:02:11.828 --> 01:02:14.589
You wanted to see me, Worshipful Master?

01:02:14.590 --> 01:02:18.340
Someone's threatening the good works
and reputation of this lodge.

01:02:18.341 --> 01:02:20.340
A man known to you.

01:02:20.341 --> 01:02:21.341
How's that?

01:02:21.342 --> 01:02:22.701
Morse, brother.

01:02:25.341 --> 01:02:28.340
Let us not deal falsely, eh?

01:02:28.341 --> 01:02:30.403
We need to check his inquiries.

01:02:31.861 --> 01:02:33.483
You'd be doing him a bit of good...

01:02:34.804 --> 01:02:36.683
...if you appeal to his reason. Well...

01:02:38.010 --> 01:02:40.341
...can't hurt your prospects,
though, can it, eh...

01:02:41.341 --> 01:02:43.341
...Inspector Strange?

01:02:44.254 --> 01:02:45.454
Inspector?

01:02:49.341 --> 01:02:51.341
For those
who keep their oaths, brother...

01:02:53.341 --> 01:02:55.341
...all things are possible.

01:03:07.547 --> 01:03:09.547
_

01:03:23.254 --> 01:03:24.934
The Page case.

01:03:26.341 --> 01:03:28.928
Miss Teagarden came across
a bundle of letters.

01:03:28.929 --> 01:03:30.928
Well, copies of letters

01:03:30.929 --> 01:03:33.340
that she found to have been given
to Garstang College

01:03:33.341 --> 01:03:34.897
as part of the Teagarden bequest.

01:03:34.898 --> 01:03:36.341
Concerning?

01:03:36.342 --> 01:03:39.341
Concerning the German side
of the family, the Baumgartens.

01:03:42.994 --> 01:03:46.340
You remember Burrowes said that he
used to go hiking on the continent

01:03:46.341 --> 01:03:48.340
- before the war?
- Digging for fossils.

01:03:48.341 --> 01:03:49.341
That's right.

01:03:49.342 --> 01:03:50.700
Well, on one such trip,

01:03:50.701 --> 01:03:54.341
he met and fell in love
with Deborah Baumgarten. Jewish.

01:03:55.341 --> 01:03:57.340
She perished, along with her family,

01:03:57.341 --> 01:03:59.643
at a labour camp called Mittelbau-Dora.

01:04:00.260 --> 01:04:03.259
I know Mittelbau. V2 rockets.

01:04:03.284 --> 01:04:05.323
Her father had been a physicist
before the war.

01:04:05.381 --> 01:04:07.340
He lectured here at Oxford,

01:04:07.341 --> 01:04:12.020
where he befriended a
maths undergrad at Garstang college.

01:04:12.021 --> 01:04:13.341
Dora.

01:04:14.341 --> 01:04:16.351
That's what was written
up on Nicholson's blackboard.

01:04:16.352 --> 01:04:18.700
Exactly, so according to these letters,

01:04:18.701 --> 01:04:21.700
Nicholson promised to get
the Baumgartens out of Germany.

01:04:21.701 --> 01:04:23.340
But when they arrived at the embassy,

01:04:23.341 --> 01:04:24.691
no-one had so much as heard of them.

01:04:24.692 --> 01:04:27.492
- Why would Nicholson betray him?
- Baumgarten came to believe

01:04:27.493 --> 01:04:30.340
that Nicholson had only ever
been interested in his notebooks,

01:04:30.341 --> 01:04:33.340
which he'd sent before him,
to Oxford, for safekeeping.

01:04:33.341 --> 01:04:35.340
- And Burrowes?
- Well, 20 years later,

01:04:35.341 --> 01:04:37.015
Burrowes was going through
the Teagarden bequest,

01:04:37.016 --> 01:04:39.340
finds these letters and this bank note.

01:04:39.341 --> 01:04:41.381
It was found by Miss Paroo
at the Bodleian.

01:04:42.341 --> 01:04:45.417
Used for currency at camp Mittelbau-Dora.

01:04:45.442 --> 01:04:46.363
Mm.

01:04:46.861 --> 01:04:49.700
Now, I believe that
Burrowes and Page had a blazing row

01:04:49.701 --> 01:04:52.341
over items that Page
cleared away from the library.

01:04:53.341 --> 01:04:55.341
I just wonder
what the significance of it is.

01:04:56.807 --> 01:04:59.701
Maybe this is what Burrowes
was looking for in Page's flat.

01:05:14.341 --> 01:05:18.341
Geology teaches a man patience.

01:05:19.221 --> 01:05:23.220
All my life, well,
the part of it which mattered,

01:05:23.245 --> 01:05:24.925
I've mourned her fate.

01:05:26.341 --> 01:05:28.370
But to find now
that it could have been avoided,

01:05:28.371 --> 01:05:30.341
should have been avoided.

01:05:31.341 --> 01:05:35.341
That we might have had a life together.

01:05:36.747 --> 01:05:39.043
Nicholson took that from me.

01:05:39.341 --> 01:05:43.341
Worse, far worse. He let them perish.

01:05:44.194 --> 01:05:45.843
I wanted him to pay for that.

01:05:46.694 --> 01:05:48.373
So, you started this campaign.

01:05:48.541 --> 01:05:52.340
The things left in his cubby hole,
the little figurine of a golem.

01:05:52.341 --> 01:05:56.021
The word "Dora" chalked up on his board.

01:05:57.341 --> 01:06:00.340
Did Page find this Mittelbau-Dora
banknote of yours?

01:06:00.341 --> 01:06:02.340
Was he aware that you were
behind this war of nerves

01:06:02.341 --> 01:06:03.880
with Nicholson?
Is that why you killed him?

01:06:03.881 --> 01:06:05.341
- Page?
- Yes, Page.

01:06:06.341 --> 01:06:09.341
I had nothing whatever to do with Page!

01:06:12.021 --> 01:06:13.523
I left that banknote...

01:06:14.885 --> 01:06:17.540
...in the Bodleian by accident,
with my list of stamps.

01:06:17.541 --> 01:06:19.340
As far as I was aware, it was lost.

01:06:19.341 --> 01:06:21.767
So, you went to Page's flat
looking for the banknote.

01:06:21.768 --> 01:06:25.540
No. Even if Osbert Page had found it,

01:06:26.083 --> 01:06:27.963
it wouldn't have meant anything to him.

01:06:27.964 --> 01:06:29.749
I freely admit the rest.

01:06:30.163 --> 01:06:33.020
Jasper Nicholson
got nothing less than he deserved,

01:06:33.563 --> 01:06:37.341
but Page, that was nothing to do with me.

01:06:38.396 --> 01:06:42.043
We know who's been sending you these
messages and all the rest of it,

01:06:42.044 --> 01:06:43.380
and we know why.

01:06:43.381 --> 01:06:46.180
They've been spoken to.
You won't be getting any more,

01:06:46.181 --> 01:06:49.830
but I can't say as I don't feel
some sympathy for who's responsible,

01:06:49.831 --> 01:06:51.341
given what you did.

01:06:52.341 --> 01:06:53.700
What I did?

01:06:53.701 --> 01:06:56.180
You promised Emil Baumgarten
and his family

01:06:56.181 --> 01:06:57.340
that you'd get them to safety.

01:06:57.341 --> 01:07:00.340
But at the last,
you just left them to their fate.

01:07:00.341 --> 01:07:03.861
I tried to get them out.

01:07:04.821 --> 01:07:07.130
I-I-I did everything
that was humanly possible.

01:07:07.131 --> 01:07:10.065
All that was in my power to do,
but it was too late.

01:07:10.066 --> 01:07:12.180
But not too late to take his work
for your own.

01:07:12.643 --> 01:07:14.340
What do you mean, his work?

01:07:14.341 --> 01:07:16.848
Yeah, his notebooks. You could
at least have given the man credit

01:07:16.849 --> 01:07:18.723
for his own work.

01:07:19.341 --> 01:07:21.341
So, that's what you think?

01:07:22.188 --> 01:07:24.187
Well, you must think it.

01:07:24.341 --> 01:07:25.341
Doctor Nicholson...

01:07:25.342 --> 01:07:27.340
Emil's work was flawed.

01:07:27.341 --> 01:07:30.341
Terribly, monstrously flawed!

01:07:31.381 --> 01:07:34.380
A-a-as I read through his notes,
it became clear to me,

01:07:34.381 --> 01:07:37.380
and it would have been obvious
to anyone else who saw

01:07:37.381 --> 01:07:40.341
that he had suffered
some kind of breakdown.

01:07:45.094 --> 01:07:46.363
I mean, his mind...

01:07:48.174 --> 01:07:52.603
...oh, his beautiful...
wonderful mind, all...

01:07:54.128 --> 01:07:56.523
...unravelling there before me
on the pages.

01:07:59.541 --> 01:08:02.340
The, er... anxiety and stress
of his situation,

01:08:02.341 --> 01:08:05.341
the worry for his family.
Well, it must have, erm...

01:08:07.074 --> 01:08:10.234
So, er... we burnt his notebooks.

01:08:11.341 --> 01:08:12.341
You destroyed them?

01:08:12.342 --> 01:08:14.340
What else should I have done?

01:08:14.341 --> 01:08:17.180
I had to protect him from those devils.

01:08:20.341 --> 01:08:24.340
They might have taken his life,
but I swore to be resolved

01:08:24.341 --> 01:08:26.643
that they would not take his reputation.

01:08:28.033 --> 01:08:31.243
He was my friend and...

01:08:34.341 --> 01:08:35.563
...I failed him.

01:08:39.341 --> 01:08:45.020
Er... I've carried the shame
of that failure...

01:08:46.341 --> 01:08:50.341
...my failure, for more than 25 years.

01:08:54.541 --> 01:08:58.341
Now, I'm a man
profoundly without faith...

01:09:00.091 --> 01:09:01.341
...but I promise you,

01:09:01.341 --> 01:09:05.341
not a day has gone by when
I have not, with utter humility...

01:09:06.341 --> 01:09:10.340
...said the Mourner's Kaddish
for Emil Baumgarten

01:09:10.341 --> 01:09:12.341
and his murdered family.

01:09:16.341 --> 01:09:19.341
- No golem, then.
- Seemingly not.

01:09:19.863 --> 01:09:22.380
Burrowes is a rambler.
If the muddy boot prints aren't his,

01:09:22.381 --> 01:09:24.042
whose are they?

01:09:27.207 --> 01:09:28.407
What's wrong?

01:09:30.341 --> 01:09:31.341
Nothing.

01:09:33.341 --> 01:09:35.340
I'll drop you at the station.

01:09:35.341 --> 01:09:36.803
And I'll put Box in the picture.

01:09:38.341 --> 01:09:40.341
I don't know what more I can say.

01:09:42.081 --> 01:09:43.759
I've told you all I can.

01:09:44.020 --> 01:09:46.763
About Nicholson, yes,
but this is about another matter.

01:09:47.094 --> 01:09:49.094
It concerns Binks and Osbert Page.

01:09:51.341 --> 01:09:54.020
The Bridge Of Sighs
was built just before...

01:09:54.020 --> 01:09:57.021
- Look, it's the Pelican Man!
- It's the Pelly!

01:10:27.341 --> 01:10:28.883
Yes, yes.

01:10:36.974 --> 01:10:38.492
Yes, yes. Of course you can.

01:10:38.517 --> 01:10:39.998
You saw it on the television?

01:10:52.341 --> 01:10:53.341
What's going on?

01:11:07.341 --> 01:11:10.021
Well, I know you,
so you must be McGyffin.

01:11:11.341 --> 01:11:13.341
Is he running you, or you running him?

01:11:14.341 --> 01:11:16.340
It's all right, Ronnie.

01:11:16.341 --> 01:11:18.341
Why don't you go and wait by the car, eh?

01:11:18.999 --> 01:11:22.340
Guess that answers that. Is he
working you with his foot, or what?

01:11:22.843 --> 01:11:24.563
You should hear 'em out, Fred...

01:11:28.274 --> 01:11:29.403
...for your own sake.

01:11:36.067 --> 01:11:38.066
I understand
you're leaving Oxford, Inspector.

01:11:38.683 --> 01:11:40.341
Putting in for a transfer.

01:11:41.055 --> 01:11:42.341
Word gets around.

01:11:42.763 --> 01:11:44.340
Yeah, well, that's all very lovely,

01:11:44.341 --> 01:11:46.381
but you need to settle
your mess bill before you go.

01:11:47.541 --> 01:11:50.341
Your boy's sticking his beak in
where it's not wanted.

01:11:51.254 --> 01:11:52.643
You stop him, or we will.

01:11:54.701 --> 01:11:56.381
You don't know Morse.

01:11:59.628 --> 01:12:00.828
How's Charlie?

01:12:03.341 --> 01:12:04.341
What did you say?

01:12:04.342 --> 01:12:06.340
Word is the Yard's
looking for your brother

01:12:06.341 --> 01:12:08.340
in connection with a long firm fraud.

01:12:08.341 --> 01:12:10.340
I wouldn't know about that.

01:12:10.341 --> 01:12:12.341
There's a cheque with your name on
says different.

01:12:14.341 --> 01:12:16.340
On the other hand,

01:12:16.341 --> 01:12:18.683
if Morse could be persuaded
to do the right thing...

01:12:24.208 --> 01:12:26.207
He's an idealist.

01:12:26.341 --> 01:12:27.380
I'm sure we all are.

01:12:27.883 --> 01:12:31.483
Maybe once, Councillor.
Now you're just a villain.

01:12:33.260 --> 01:12:35.563
Same as this two-bob shitehawk.

01:12:41.341 --> 01:12:43.021
Look...

01:12:45.227 --> 01:12:48.043
...you play fair and all your troubles...

01:12:49.028 --> 01:12:50.028
...disappear.

01:12:51.181 --> 01:12:52.603
The cheque, gone.

01:12:53.341 --> 01:12:55.341
Everything back to how it was.

01:12:56.501 --> 01:12:58.461
Just bring him out
to Wicklesham tomorrow.

01:13:00.341 --> 01:13:02.643
Maybe between us,
we can talk some sense into him.

01:13:14.341 --> 01:13:15.341
Fred...

01:13:18.114 --> 01:13:20.283
What've you got me into, you cowson?

01:13:21.341 --> 01:13:23.340
You can't beat 'em, Fred.

01:13:23.341 --> 01:13:24.341
I know.

01:13:25.047 --> 01:13:26.406
I thought it'd just be
a nice little tickle.

01:13:26.431 --> 01:13:28.070
In and out, and no harm done, but...

01:13:28.810 --> 01:13:30.181
but once you're in...

01:13:31.341 --> 01:13:32.923
...these boys play for keeps.

01:13:35.181 --> 01:13:36.363
It's you or Morse.

01:14:12.953 --> 01:14:14.473
Everything all right?

01:14:15.873 --> 01:14:16.873
Yeah.

01:14:18.993 --> 01:14:20.952
I've been to see Burrowes.

01:14:20.953 --> 01:14:21.953
And?

01:14:21.954 --> 01:14:25.521
I think I know who killed Page,
or who ordered it at least,

01:14:25.522 --> 01:14:27.669
even if he didn't do his own
dirty work. Drink?

01:14:27.670 --> 01:14:28.963
Thanks.

01:14:31.613 --> 01:14:35.292
Page had been looking into the
disappearance of a fellow rambler.

01:14:35.317 --> 01:14:36.637
A man called Hollis Binks.

01:14:37.546 --> 01:14:39.545
You remember the initials we found
in his flat

01:14:39.570 --> 01:14:41.569
- on the map on the wall? HB.
- Who is Binks?

01:14:41.846 --> 01:14:43.846
Binks was the borough surveyor.

01:14:44.285 --> 01:14:46.964
His body was recovered from
the foundations of Cranmer House.

01:14:47.300 --> 01:14:49.620
Box's unknown. Why wasn't I told?

01:14:50.953 --> 01:14:52.952
Well, I'm telling you now.

01:14:52.953 --> 01:14:55.952
I think Binks's death and Page's death,

01:14:55.953 --> 01:14:58.292
are both related to what happened
at Cranmer House.

01:14:58.293 --> 01:15:00.602
Cranmer House was built
by McGyffin Construction,

01:15:00.603 --> 01:15:04.308
using concrete which should
have contained high-quality sand

01:15:04.309 --> 01:15:06.952
from Four Winds Aggregate
out at Wicklesham.

01:15:06.953 --> 01:15:09.435
But McGyffin also owns another place
out on the Gower Coast.

01:15:09.436 --> 01:15:10.953
The Gower.

01:15:10.954 --> 01:15:12.953
That's where Page wrote HB on the map.

01:15:13.953 --> 01:15:16.312
I think he was adulterating the concrete

01:15:16.313 --> 01:15:18.717
with unwashed sea sand
from the Gower Coast.

01:15:18.718 --> 01:15:19.953
So?

01:15:19.954 --> 01:15:21.523
So, salt.

01:15:21.953 --> 01:15:25.792
The sodium in the sea sand-concrete mix

01:15:25.793 --> 01:15:28.952
would have corroded the iron rebars
running through Cranmer House,

01:15:28.953 --> 01:15:30.952
weakening the entire structure.

01:15:30.953 --> 01:15:32.952
Concrete cancer, they call it.

01:15:33.363 --> 01:15:35.953
- That's why the tower collapsed.
- Mm.

01:15:36.514 --> 01:15:39.282
I think they were using sub-standard
material, charging full price,

01:15:39.283 --> 01:15:40.953
and pocketing the difference.

01:15:42.313 --> 01:15:45.952
So, Binks worked out
McGyffin was running a scam?

01:15:45.953 --> 01:15:48.953
Yeah, him and his former boss,
Councillor Burkitt.

01:15:50.206 --> 01:15:51.845
He'd been to see Professor Burrowes

01:15:51.870 --> 01:15:53.870
to talk about geology before he died.

01:15:54.572 --> 01:15:56.571
They killed Binks and Osbert Page?

01:15:56.953 --> 01:16:00.053
Well, I've got forensics looking
into the muddy boot prints

01:16:00.054 --> 01:16:02.192
we found both in the library
and at Page's flat.

01:16:02.193 --> 01:16:04.690
And I'm convinced that
it's going to be the same material

01:16:04.691 --> 01:16:06.731
will be found at Wicklesham Quarry.

01:16:06.732 --> 01:16:09.271
If Page was worried about Binks,
why didn't he come to us,

01:16:09.272 --> 01:16:10.396
report him missing?

01:16:10.397 --> 01:16:11.953
- Maybe he was afraid.
- Of what?

01:16:11.954 --> 01:16:13.269
Of us.

01:16:13.270 --> 01:16:16.953
If a senior councillor is involved,
then who knows how far it goes?

01:16:20.779 --> 01:16:22.043
Say you're right...

01:16:24.953 --> 01:16:26.153
...people like that...

01:16:27.166 --> 01:16:28.563
...it only goes one way.

01:16:30.153 --> 01:16:31.793
What are you saying?

01:16:32.566 --> 01:16:34.566
It's a hiding to nothing.

01:16:35.953 --> 01:16:37.953
You want another Blenheim Vale?

01:16:40.825 --> 01:16:42.185
You've gotta let it drop.

01:16:43.559 --> 01:16:45.558
Who are you trying to protect? Box?

01:16:45.846 --> 01:16:46.846
That what you think?

01:16:46.871 --> 01:16:49.148
It wasn't, but maybe I was wrong,
and everyone else is right.

01:16:49.173 --> 01:16:50.894
- About what?
- About you.

01:16:50.919 --> 01:16:53.957
I thought I knew who you were, but
this year, I barely recognise you.

01:16:53.993 --> 01:16:55.469
Always given me too much credit.

01:16:55.470 --> 01:16:57.472
- I'm not what you think.
- What is going on?

01:16:57.473 --> 01:16:59.312
- You've got to let it go.
- I can't.

01:16:59.313 --> 01:17:00.953
That's an order!

01:17:17.413 --> 01:17:18.413
Morse.

01:17:18.438 --> 01:17:20.262
'Ah, there you are. It's Max.'

01:17:20.287 --> 01:17:21.642
It's late for you.

01:17:21.669 --> 01:17:24.671
'Listen... I've just had the results
through on your muddy boot prints.'

01:17:24.672 --> 01:17:26.952
- Ah.
- 'As suspected,

01:17:26.953 --> 01:17:29.952
'consistent with material
found locally at Wicklesham.

01:17:29.953 --> 01:17:31.313
'Sorry, wait a minute.

01:17:32.652 --> 01:17:33.652
'Can I help you?'

01:17:37.532 --> 01:17:38.532
Doctor?

01:17:40.339 --> 01:17:41.339
Max!

01:17:42.674 --> 01:17:46.953
'Mexicali Rose' by Jim Reeves

01:17:49.953 --> 01:17:51.792
I'm off to bed now.

01:17:51.793 --> 01:17:52.953
Right.

01:17:53.566 --> 01:17:54.566
I'm sorry.

01:17:57.799 --> 01:17:59.203
I made a mess of things.

01:18:01.406 --> 01:18:02.726
I love you.

01:18:03.157 --> 01:18:04.953
Sorry was all I wanted.

01:18:05.739 --> 01:18:06.739
I know.

01:18:08.626 --> 01:18:10.626
I've loved you too long to stop now.

01:18:12.606 --> 01:18:13.883
I should've said it sooner.

01:18:25.199 --> 01:18:26.679
Better late than never.

01:19:27.441 --> 01:19:30.123
I heard the telephone.

01:19:30.947 --> 01:19:32.107
Yes.

01:19:33.727 --> 01:19:36.727
Yes, it was, er... it was just work.

01:19:37.441 --> 01:19:38.843
What's wrong?

01:19:40.723 --> 01:19:44.283
A moment's courage
or a lifetime of regret?

01:19:49.681 --> 01:19:51.681
That's always been the choice.

01:20:18.228 --> 01:20:19.443
Surprised?

01:20:22.441 --> 01:20:25.003
You couldn't see me for Box.

01:20:27.441 --> 01:20:29.440
No-one's coming.

01:20:29.441 --> 01:20:33.883
It's how we came into the world,
you, me, all of us.

01:20:35.441 --> 01:20:37.763
We're born and we die alone.

01:20:59.441 --> 01:21:01.123
All right, Morse.

01:21:02.283 --> 01:21:04.258
You picked the wrong team, brother.

01:21:04.783 --> 01:21:07.723
We're city men, first and last.

01:21:08.441 --> 01:21:10.087
We mind our own.

01:21:10.088 --> 01:21:11.441
Where's DeBryn?

01:21:12.441 --> 01:21:13.441
Alive?

01:21:13.969 --> 01:21:15.968
Last time I looked.

01:21:18.441 --> 01:21:21.757
It's all right, Doctor.
We'll have you home safe soon.

01:21:21.758 --> 01:21:24.277
That's not how this goes.
You must have known that.

01:21:24.278 --> 01:21:25.960
You can't believe
you'll get away with the murder

01:21:25.961 --> 01:21:28.848
of four police officers
and a Home Office pathologist.

01:21:28.849 --> 01:21:30.718
They plan to hang the crimes on us, sir.

01:21:30.743 --> 01:21:33.742
Who killed Fancy? You or Ronnie?

01:21:33.743 --> 01:21:34.743
Box?

01:21:34.744 --> 01:21:36.583
- It was his gun.
- Once.

01:21:37.329 --> 01:21:39.742
But he's not the sand
for man's work, or he'd be here now.

01:21:39.743 --> 01:21:41.743
You stole Nero's heroin.

01:21:42.743 --> 01:21:43.743
It's the next big thing.

01:21:43.744 --> 01:21:45.422
You took over his whole business.

01:21:45.423 --> 01:21:46.942
The protection, the drugs, everything.

01:21:46.943 --> 01:21:50.742
Who better than a copper to know
every filthy racket in the city?

01:21:50.743 --> 01:21:53.103
How many times you seen them
get away with it, Fred?

01:21:54.331 --> 01:21:56.742
- It's a stacked deck.
- The truth will come out.

01:21:56.743 --> 01:21:58.743
Or the truth'll be what I put
in my report.

01:22:00.609 --> 01:22:02.609
A falling out of corrupt coppers...

01:22:04.563 --> 01:22:06.563
...and I settled the last man standing.

01:22:09.743 --> 01:22:10.883
Al?

01:22:12.943 --> 01:22:18.203
DS Jago may bear some influence
over uniform and CID...

01:22:19.783 --> 01:22:22.963
...but his writ will not run
as far as Traffic.

01:22:26.743 --> 01:22:27.743
Sod this.

01:22:28.743 --> 01:22:31.163
- Get out. Get out!
- Take 'em!

01:23:31.743 --> 01:23:33.423
It's over, Fred.

01:23:44.743 --> 01:23:45.963
Put it down.

01:23:50.743 --> 01:23:52.743
Drop the gun...

01:23:53.743 --> 01:23:55.103
...now!

01:23:56.263 --> 01:23:58.056
You wouldn't shoot a man
in the back, would you, Morse?

01:23:58.057 --> 01:23:59.743
The same way you shot George Fancy?

01:24:02.743 --> 01:24:04.422
He was just in the wrong place.

01:24:04.782 --> 01:24:06.462
Drug money.

01:24:08.743 --> 01:24:09.883
Put him down.

01:24:19.076 --> 01:24:20.396
Well, well, well.

01:24:22.743 --> 01:24:23.843
Guv'nor.

01:24:25.743 --> 01:24:27.743
Found some bottle at last?

01:24:29.642 --> 01:24:31.642
We can all still walk out of here alive.

01:24:33.563 --> 01:24:34.742
Boss?

01:24:34.743 --> 01:24:36.742
No, we can't.

01:24:52.363 --> 01:24:54.263
I couldn't let him do it.

01:25:01.103 --> 01:25:02.743
Who'd have thought?

01:25:06.743 --> 01:25:07.923
Ronnie?

01:25:09.743 --> 01:25:11.043
Ronnie!

01:25:17.436 --> 01:25:18.436
Ronnie.

01:25:23.456 --> 01:25:25.136
Get an ambulance.

01:25:27.743 --> 01:25:29.742
- You all right?
- Oh, yes.

01:25:29.743 --> 01:25:30.743
Here.

01:25:30.744 --> 01:25:33.583
Oh, thanks.

01:25:34.116 --> 01:25:36.763
Cracked. Bugger!

01:25:43.103 --> 01:25:44.743
I can't judge him.

01:25:46.050 --> 01:25:47.530
I took a...

01:25:50.509 --> 01:25:51.723
...wrong turn.

01:25:53.743 --> 01:25:54.743
He came good in the end.

01:25:54.744 --> 01:25:56.583
If he pulls through...

01:25:57.356 --> 01:25:59.283
...maybe we all get a second chance.

01:26:01.043 --> 01:26:02.743
George didn't.

01:26:04.510 --> 01:26:05.510
All right, thanks.

01:26:07.743 --> 01:26:08.743
Burkitt?

01:26:08.744 --> 01:26:11.742
Turned Queen's.
Put the black spot on all of them.

01:26:11.743 --> 01:26:13.102
He say who did for Page?

01:26:13.103 --> 01:26:15.743
McGyffin's heavies, on his orders.

01:26:17.376 --> 01:26:18.536
That was the hospital.

01:26:19.323 --> 01:26:20.523
Box is 50-50.

01:26:20.744 --> 01:26:24.422
The report will reflect
a drugs ring smashed,

01:26:24.423 --> 01:26:26.743
a criminal conspiracy unmasked...

01:26:27.743 --> 01:26:31.742
...and the death of a brave
detective constable finally avenged.

01:26:31.743 --> 01:26:34.782
- And ACC Bottoms?
- Is to take early retirement.

01:26:34.783 --> 01:26:38.024
The force cannot be judged by the
behaviour of a few rotten apples.

01:26:38.025 --> 01:26:40.262
Division have assured me
there will be changes.

01:26:40.263 --> 01:26:42.742
- For the better, I hope.
- Indeed.

01:26:42.743 --> 01:26:46.310
Alas, I will be leaving Traffic,

01:26:46.311 --> 01:26:49.743
to assume overall command at Castle Gate.

01:26:51.503 --> 01:26:54.502
But with impending losses, I shall
need a reliable detective sergeant,

01:26:54.527 --> 01:26:57.021
if you're done with your
Forward Planning Committee.

01:26:57.046 --> 01:26:58.199
Sir.

01:26:58.224 --> 01:27:00.063
And a good man to head CID.

01:27:00.423 --> 01:27:02.742
Acting Chief Inspector,

01:27:02.743 --> 01:27:05.263
might you be persuaded
to forego your transfer?

01:27:07.589 --> 01:27:09.589
It depends on home, sir.

01:27:11.336 --> 01:27:12.843
As does so much.

01:27:15.743 --> 01:27:16.743
Morse.

01:27:18.456 --> 01:27:19.456
Sir.

01:27:22.016 --> 01:27:23.856
Very well.

01:27:25.743 --> 01:27:26.743
Carry on.

01:27:47.743 --> 01:27:52.582
There's a bagman's desk
going begging If you want it.

01:27:55.263 --> 01:27:57.643
Castle Gate CID. DS Strange speaking.

01:28:00.743 --> 01:28:02.181
I'll be needing a car.

01:28:02.182 --> 01:28:04.263
Well, I'm sure we can find you something.

01:28:07.743 --> 01:28:08.782
Got Mrs Thursday on the blower.

01:28:08.783 --> 01:28:11.742
I said you're fine,
but she doesn't sound best pleased.

01:28:12.283 --> 01:28:13.912
Wants to know
what time you're coming home.

01:28:13.913 --> 01:28:15.742
Tell her he'll be home shortly.

01:28:16.003 --> 01:28:18.423
Go on. I can manage.

01:28:19.743 --> 01:28:20.743
I know you can.

01:28:22.743 --> 01:28:24.263
Right, then.

01:28:26.583 --> 01:28:27.943
Usual time in the morning.

01:28:41.609 --> 01:28:43.609
Morse, Thames Valley.

01:29:51.943 --> 01:29:55.743
