WEBVTT

00:01.044 --> 00:03.090
My name is H.G. Wells.

00:03.133 --> 00:05.701
My friend John
is Jack the Ripper.

00:05.744 --> 00:07.964
He's escaped from 1893
in my time machine,

00:08.008 --> 00:10.184
and I am the only one
who can catch him.

00:11.272 --> 00:13.709
I'm going to kill
one person every day...

00:13.752 --> 00:16.277
Jane?...until I get the time machine
with the key.

00:16.320 --> 00:17.626
Where's Jane?

00:17.669 --> 00:19.628
Key, or Jane dies.

00:19.671 --> 00:20.977
She is his
only leverage over you.

00:21.021 --> 00:22.457
Why would he kill her?

00:22.500 --> 00:24.633
He will kill her
just to get back at me.

00:24.676 --> 00:26.287
Let her go, John.

00:26.330 --> 00:27.331
Slide it to me.

00:31.335 --> 00:33.033
Damn it, Wells.

00:34.686 --> 00:36.993
You truly are a ray of light,
Miss Walker.

00:37.037 --> 00:38.821
You got to start
calling me Jane.

00:38.864 --> 00:40.649
Right.

00:43.608 --> 00:45.480

Oh, yes,

02:59.004 --> 03:01.616
Yes, she said
you were away on...

Did you get any sleep?

04:06.637 --> 04:08.073
There's just no time.

04:08.117 --> 04:09.771
John has threatened
to kill someone every day

04:09.814 --> 04:11.120
until he gets
what he wants.

04:11.163 --> 04:12.600
There are no reports
of any new victims.

04:12.643 --> 04:16.038
And the time machine
is safe here at my house.

04:16.081 --> 04:18.345
All right.Now, can you fix it?

04:18.388 --> 04:20.912
Uh, yes.

04:20.956 --> 04:22.740
I believe so.

04:22.784 --> 04:24.307
It'll take some time,

04:24.351 --> 04:26.570
but it was worth it
to keep John from escaping.

04:26.614 --> 04:27.745
What's that?

04:27.789 --> 04:29.921
Some type of crystal.

04:29.965 --> 04:32.272
That is
an alexandrite gemstone.

04:32.315 --> 04:34.143
It focuses the light
into a specific wavelength

04:34.186 --> 04:36.319
that allows the machine
to breach the fourth dimension.

04:36.363 --> 04:39.104
It is the very heart and soul
of the time machine.

04:39.148 --> 04:40.802
Well, the important thing
is that we find John

04:40.845 --> 04:41.977
as soon as possible.

04:42.020 --> 04:44.066
I have my team
out looking.

04:44.109 --> 04:45.807
Morning.

04:49.811 --> 04:52.596
Hello.

04:52.640 --> 04:53.597
Hi.

04:53.641 --> 04:54.642
You look lovely.

04:54.685 --> 04:56.208
Thank you.

04:56.252 --> 04:58.298
Doug picked up some of my things
from my apartment.

04:58.341 --> 04:59.473
Oh.

04:59.516 --> 05:00.822
Ms. Anders,
thank you so much

05:00.865 --> 05:02.345
for letting me
stay here.

05:02.389 --> 05:04.173
Your home
is spectacular.You're welcome.

05:04.216 --> 05:05.566
The most important thing
is that we keep you safe

05:05.609 --> 05:07.394
until this is over.

05:07.437 --> 05:09.004
I'll look into
what we talked about.Yes. Thank you.

05:11.702 --> 05:13.356
So, how are you
holding up?

05:13.400 --> 05:14.705
I'm good.

05:14.749 --> 05:16.054
Although,
the museum's pretty freaked

05:16.098 --> 05:17.969
that Vanessa moved
the whole exhibit.

05:18.013 --> 05:19.362
They have no idea
what's going on.

05:19.406 --> 05:21.016
I hope I didn't put your job
in jeopardy.

05:21.059 --> 05:22.626
No.

05:22.670 --> 05:25.107
My boss is scared that Vanessa
will sue for negligence,

05:25.150 --> 05:27.936
so I told her
that Vanessa needed me here

05:27.979 --> 05:30.112
working on an inventory
for the insurance claim.

05:30.155 --> 05:31.592
Oh.

05:31.635 --> 05:33.594
Remember, H.G. Wells
is my responsibility.

05:33.637 --> 05:35.030
Oh, I am?

05:35.073 --> 05:37.772
Yes, you are.

05:39.643 --> 05:42.298
The exhibit, that is.Right.

05:43.473 --> 05:45.606
Listen, um...

05:45.649 --> 05:48.391
with everything
you've been through,

05:48.435 --> 05:51.438
if at any point you want out,
you tell me.

05:51.481 --> 05:52.439
I'll understand.

05:52.482 --> 05:53.831
Yeah.

05:53.875 --> 05:56.617
It's been pretty intense
the past couple days.

05:56.660 --> 05:58.662
But I want
to see this through.

05:58.706 --> 06:00.142
I want
to help you.

06:01.665 --> 06:03.493
Oh.

06:03.537 --> 06:05.800
Hello,
this is Jane.

06:05.843 --> 06:08.890
Hello, Miss Walker.
How lovely to hear your voice.

06:12.110 --> 06:14.156
Well,
I can't say the same.

06:14.199 --> 06:15.766
Well, that hurts --

06:15.810 --> 06:17.855
especially after spending
such quality time together.

06:17.899 --> 06:20.075
I remember it
rather fondly.What do you want?

06:20.118 --> 06:21.990
I want the key
and the time machine -- now.

06:22.033 --> 06:23.905
What do you plan on
doing with it?

06:25.472 --> 06:27.430
Hello, H.G.

06:27.474 --> 06:28.431
Well, I don't know.

06:28.475 --> 06:30.041
Perhaps I'll go somewhere

06:30.085 --> 06:32.914
that would allow me
the opportunity to change --

06:32.957 --> 06:34.655
be a good little boy.

06:34.698 --> 06:37.266
You see, I'm on a personal
journey of self-enlightenment,

06:37.309 --> 06:40.356
thanks to the eye-opening
Miss Walker.

06:40.400 --> 06:41.836
Very well.
Come and get it.

06:41.879 --> 06:43.098
I don't think so.

06:43.141 --> 06:45.230
I shall call you
with the exact location,

06:45.274 --> 06:47.102
and you will have
precisely five minutes

06:47.145 --> 06:50.453
to travel to me with the machine
and the key.

06:50.497 --> 06:52.237
You want me to bring
the time machine to you?

06:52.281 --> 06:53.630
Yes.

06:53.674 --> 06:55.458
I won't fall
into one of your traps, H.G.

06:55.502 --> 06:56.677
You won't fool me again.

06:56.720 --> 06:58.156
Well,
I can't oblige, John,

06:58.200 --> 06:59.941
because the time machine
is broken.

06:59.984 --> 07:01.551
Oh, don't be ridiculous.

07:01.595 --> 07:03.466
He's telling the truth,
John.
John?

07:03.510 --> 07:05.381
Are we on
a first-name basis?

07:05.425 --> 07:08.428
I like that, Jane.

07:09.690 --> 07:11.518
You saw me
sabotage it yourself.

07:11.561 --> 07:13.084
I saw some smoke
and loose wires --

07:13.128 --> 07:15.043
nothing the father
of time travel can't remedy.

07:15.086 --> 07:17.132
I will give you 12 hours
to fix the machine.

07:17.175 --> 07:18.350
Please don't hurt anyone.

07:18.394 --> 07:19.917
I granted you life once,
Jane,

07:19.961 --> 07:21.702
due to my growing affection
for you,

07:21.745 --> 07:23.399
but it won't happen again.

07:23.443 --> 07:25.706
You know
how the saying goes --

07:25.749 --> 07:28.143
one step forward,
two steps back.

07:28.186 --> 07:30.885
You have 12 hours
before I kill again.

07:32.016 --> 07:33.540
The clock starts now.

07:33.583 --> 07:35.150
But I can't j--

07:35.193 --> 07:36.543
John?

07:36.586 --> 07:37.892
John?

07:57.651 --> 07:59.304
H.G., Jane,
this is Martin Scott.

07:59.348 --> 08:01.829
He works in the innovation
division at my company.

08:01.872 --> 08:03.483
Mr. Scott.

08:03.526 --> 08:05.180
I asked Vanessa to find someone
to assist me in navigating

08:05.223 --> 08:09.010
some of the, uh, finer points
of 21st-century technology.

08:09.053 --> 08:11.186
Mr. Wells, my background
is in theoretical physics

08:11.229 --> 08:12.927
and quantum mechanics.
Oh.

08:12.970 --> 08:15.538
It is a mind-blowing honor
to meet you, sir.

08:15.582 --> 08:17.105
I've read
every book you've written

08:17.148 --> 08:19.020
and seen every movie
based on your work,

08:19.063 --> 08:21.109
my favorite being
"The Invisible Man" --

08:21.152 --> 08:22.763
the Claude Rains
1933 version.

08:22.806 --> 08:25.548
Movies,
as in moving pictures?

08:25.592 --> 08:27.985
In your time, it was
a kinetoscope cinematic device.

08:28.029 --> 08:29.900
Ah.It's evolved a lot
since then.

08:29.944 --> 08:32.250
Ms. Anders,
your appointment is waiting.

08:32.294 --> 08:33.904
I'll leave you
to it, then.

08:33.948 --> 08:35.210
Thank you.

08:35.253 --> 08:38.430
Mr. Scott,
this key currently controls

08:38.474 --> 08:40.128
where the time machine returns
after a journey.

08:41.521 --> 08:42.696
I would like you
to help me change that.

08:42.739 --> 08:44.393
I wish to ensure
the time machine returns

08:44.436 --> 08:47.483
directly to this ballroom
once John Stevenson is inside.

08:47.527 --> 08:49.006
Can I see
your control board?

08:49.050 --> 08:51.792
Yes, you, uh, you may.

08:53.054 --> 08:54.055
Hi.

08:54.098 --> 08:55.883
Hey, baby.

08:57.014 --> 08:58.668
You look nervous.

08:58.712 --> 09:00.148
No, not at all.

09:00.191 --> 09:02.585
Okay,
maybe a little bit.

09:03.847 --> 09:05.283
You're so cute.

09:05.327 --> 09:07.329
Well, I'm still not used to
giving interviews.

09:07.372 --> 09:08.417
I thought you said
this was a fluff piece.

09:08.460 --> 09:09.940
It is,
but this reporter

09:09.984 --> 09:11.681
has a reputation
for being somewhat of a snake.

09:11.725 --> 09:13.204
Well, if it's good
for the campaign --

09:13.248 --> 09:16.686
No, I know.
But I signed up for this.

09:16.730 --> 09:18.122
You didn't.

09:18.166 --> 09:19.646
It means a lot to me
that you're doing this.

09:19.689 --> 09:21.561
And you
mean a lot to me.

09:21.604 --> 09:23.345
Let's do this.
Okay.

09:23.388 --> 09:24.738
She's waiting for us.

09:26.391 --> 09:30.004
I'm so excited you both agreed
to this interview.

09:30.047 --> 09:31.614
Well, we love
your magazine.

09:31.658 --> 09:33.268
I'll start with a question
on everyone's mind --

09:33.311 --> 09:35.357
after two years
of dating,

09:35.400 --> 09:37.402
any talk
of formalizing things?

09:37.446 --> 09:39.187
Somebody's looking for a scoop.

09:39.230 --> 09:41.232
One of the most powerful
businesswomen in the world

09:41.276 --> 09:43.844
and a decorated war veteran
running for senator.

09:43.887 --> 09:45.585
It could be
the wedding of the year.

09:45.628 --> 09:47.848
We don't really think
of ourselves as a power couple.

09:47.891 --> 09:49.850
But you are.

09:49.893 --> 09:51.373
Your mutually
beneficial partnership

09:51.416 --> 09:53.244
has certainly lifted
yourpublic profile.

09:53.288 --> 09:55.682
Well, that's not why
Griffin and I are together.

09:55.725 --> 09:57.945
Well, let's talk about
something else.

09:57.988 --> 09:59.468
Like Vanessa's philanthropy.

09:59.511 --> 10:00.817
Yes.

10:00.861 --> 10:02.689
And you do so
with very little publicity.

10:02.732 --> 10:04.952
Why maintain
such a low profile?

10:04.995 --> 10:08.433
Well, I've always been
a private person.

10:08.477 --> 10:11.175
I believe our actions
speak for themselves.

10:12.350 --> 10:13.656
The equations you used

10:13.700 --> 10:15.440
to calculate
the subatomic compression rate

10:15.484 --> 10:17.268
necessary to breach
the fourth dimension

10:17.312 --> 10:19.270
were...
super complicated,

10:19.314 --> 10:22.578
but I think I've got them all
inputted into the computer.

10:22.622 --> 10:25.450
So much information at the very
touch of your fingertips.

10:25.494 --> 10:27.583
I never could've imagined
such a device.

10:27.627 --> 10:30.281
But you did.

10:30.325 --> 10:33.241
You called it
a "world brain,"

10:33.284 --> 10:35.156
a "world Encyclopedia"
Ah, ah.

10:35.199 --> 10:36.723
He hasn't written
the "World Brain" yet.

10:36.766 --> 10:38.333
Sorry.

10:38.376 --> 10:41.118
Well, perhaps this is
the exact moment I got the idea.

10:41.162 --> 10:43.599
Shall we
test out the machine?

10:44.948 --> 10:47.124
Would you like
to do the honor?

10:52.521 --> 10:53.740
Brilliant.

10:53.783 --> 10:55.350
That's brilliant.

10:55.393 --> 10:57.091
John will think the key
still controls the time machine.

10:57.134 --> 10:58.832
Let's have a go, then,
shall we?

10:58.875 --> 11:00.181
What are you doing?

11:01.182 --> 11:02.705
I'm not going anywhere.

11:02.749 --> 11:06.622
This is just a test
to see if it's still functional.

11:16.545 --> 11:18.678
What's wrong now?

11:27.991 --> 11:30.994
Is that normal?

11:35.695 --> 11:37.653
What is that?

11:37.697 --> 11:39.481
Excuse me
for a second.

11:39.524 --> 11:40.612
No, I'll go.

11:40.656 --> 11:42.789
No, you stay here
with Chase.

11:44.529 --> 11:45.792
What happened?

11:45.835 --> 11:47.141
He was testing
the ignition.

11:47.184 --> 11:48.403
Are you all right?

11:48.446 --> 11:49.752
I'm fine, I'm fine.

11:52.755 --> 11:54.322
Oh.

11:58.369 --> 11:59.936
What's wrong?

11:59.980 --> 12:03.244
This gem is the heart of the
temporal-distortion generator.

12:03.287 --> 12:06.987
The surplus energy from
the power surge has cracked it.

12:07.030 --> 12:09.076
You can fix it, though,
right?

12:09.119 --> 12:10.468
No.
I can't.

12:10.512 --> 12:11.818
It's destroyed.

12:12.819 --> 12:15.169
We'll never
meet John's deadline now.

13:07.612 --> 13:09.571
Oh, ah. Oh.

13:09.614 --> 13:11.225
So sorry.
No, it's okay.

13:11.268 --> 13:12.400
It's not your fault.

13:12.443 --> 13:13.880
I have carpal tunnel.

13:13.923 --> 13:15.403
Ah.

13:15.446 --> 13:16.752
Let me take a look
at that for you.

13:16.796 --> 13:19.320
Oh.

13:20.625 --> 13:21.931
It's tender,

13:21.975 --> 13:23.628
but everything's
structurally in order.

13:25.326 --> 13:29.156
Well, I suppose I just need
to stay off the computer, right?

13:29.199 --> 13:31.593
So, are you a doctor
or a yoga instructor?

13:31.636 --> 13:34.291
Surgeon, actually.

13:35.597 --> 13:38.687
I knew
you were too good to be true.

13:40.123 --> 13:42.169
Beg your pardon?

13:43.213 --> 13:46.869
Looks, accent, charm,
anda surgeon?

13:46.913 --> 13:48.784
Oh, I know your type.

13:48.828 --> 13:52.005
Brotherhood of
the Insufferable Hero Complex.

13:52.048 --> 13:53.876
Slice first,
ask questions later.

13:53.920 --> 13:55.922
Mm.

13:55.965 --> 13:58.011
That sounded much more charming
in my head.

13:58.054 --> 14:00.317
Hi. I'm Brooke.
I'm a neuropathologist.

14:00.361 --> 14:03.886
Obviously, I'm still trying to
figure out my own brain damage.

14:03.930 --> 14:05.148
Neurology?

14:05.192 --> 14:07.237
I've always
been fascinated.

14:07.281 --> 14:10.371
It's an underrepresented
speciality where I'm from.

14:10.414 --> 14:12.373
Well, there's still
so much we have to discover.

14:12.416 --> 14:14.462
And so little we can do
to fix what goes wrong.

14:14.505 --> 14:15.898
Hmm.

14:15.942 --> 14:17.900
But of course, great
advancements have been made.

14:17.944 --> 14:19.902
No, you were right
the first time.

14:19.946 --> 14:21.643
But I'm working on it.

14:21.686 --> 14:24.385
Well, I fear humanity
must wait a bit longer.

14:24.428 --> 14:26.822
I would be honored
to buy you a drink.

14:30.870 --> 14:33.263
Can't we just
get another one?

14:33.307 --> 14:36.440
The alexandrite was mined in
the Ural Mountains in the 1600s.

14:36.484 --> 14:38.486
It was rare in 1893.

14:38.529 --> 14:40.357
And it must be
this exact size and cut.

14:40.401 --> 14:42.969
It might not even
exist now.

14:43.012 --> 14:44.840
How does this stone
allow for time travel?

14:44.884 --> 14:47.103
The facets of the gemstone
have been carefully cut

14:47.147 --> 14:48.713
to reflect
a beam of light

14:48.757 --> 14:51.542
that allow the machine to pierce
the very fabric of time.

14:51.586 --> 14:54.371
You created the laser
all the way back in the 1890s.

14:55.895 --> 14:58.506
There's a gemologist
I met through the museum.

14:58.549 --> 15:00.900
We've used him to appraise
antique jewelry for us.

15:00.943 --> 15:02.902
If anyone can find
an extinct Russian rock,

15:02.945 --> 15:04.033
it's him.

15:04.077 --> 15:05.382
The clock is ticking.

15:05.426 --> 15:07.558
Doug, any word
on John Stevenson?

15:07.602 --> 15:09.169
He's using burner phones,
then tossing them.

15:09.212 --> 15:10.518
Impossible to trace.

15:10.561 --> 15:12.041
I'm following
the police investigation.

15:12.085 --> 15:14.043
They don't
have much yet.

15:22.791 --> 15:24.749
Sam?

15:26.751 --> 15:29.841
Sam?

15:31.278 --> 15:33.758
Sam's gone
for groceries.

15:35.238 --> 15:38.546
Where's my tea?

15:38.589 --> 15:40.374
No, not Sam.

15:40.417 --> 15:41.766
It's me.

15:41.810 --> 15:44.421
It's Chad --
your son.

15:44.465 --> 15:47.729
Mom,
you know me.

15:49.470 --> 15:54.040
Chad,
you've come to see me.

15:54.083 --> 15:56.085
Just for
a few minutes.

15:56.129 --> 15:57.913
Sam can't find me here.

15:57.957 --> 16:00.960
Sam --
h-he's getting groceries.

16:01.003 --> 16:02.483
And he'll be back soon.

16:02.526 --> 16:03.919
But I had to see you.

16:03.963 --> 16:05.007
It's happening.

16:05.051 --> 16:06.966
What's happening?

16:07.009 --> 16:09.838
The time machine.
H.G. Wells.

16:10.839 --> 16:14.016
H.G. Wells.

16:14.060 --> 16:15.452
He's in New York.

16:15.496 --> 16:18.064
He's here now.
He came in his time machine.

16:20.109 --> 16:24.157
Are you sure
it's really him?

16:24.200 --> 16:26.637
Did he bring the Ripper
with him?
Yes.

16:26.681 --> 16:29.075
They're both here.

16:29.118 --> 16:33.079
It's all real, Mom,
just as you said.

16:33.122 --> 16:35.603
Then you can stop them.

16:35.646 --> 16:37.039
There's still time.

16:37.083 --> 16:38.693
Don't let them go back.

16:38.736 --> 16:41.435
You can stop this all
from happening.

16:41.478 --> 16:43.350
Please, stop.

16:44.829 --> 16:46.440
Okay, Mom, I will.

16:46.483 --> 16:48.529
Just breathe.

16:58.147 --> 16:59.975
I have to go,
Mom.

17:00.019 --> 17:02.630
It's important
you not tell Sam I was here.

17:05.676 --> 17:09.985
I love you,
Mom.

17:26.132 --> 17:27.916
Excuse me, sir,
can I help you?

17:27.959 --> 17:30.919
I was just, uh, wondering
what all the noise was earlier.

17:30.962 --> 17:31.920
Griffin.

17:31.963 --> 17:33.400
I was afraid
you left.

17:33.443 --> 17:34.618
No, no.

17:34.662 --> 17:37.099
The reporter left --
very confused.

17:37.143 --> 17:39.580
I'm still here.I'm so sorry.

17:39.623 --> 17:42.757
You've been
apologizing a lot lately.

17:42.800 --> 17:46.152
Instead, how about you tell me
what's going on?

17:46.195 --> 17:48.241
Ever since
George arrived,

17:48.284 --> 17:51.244
you've been canceling plans,
making excuses...
No.

17:51.287 --> 17:53.681
...you rush off
in the middle of an interview

17:53.724 --> 17:55.639
i-it took my staff weeks
to set up.

17:55.683 --> 17:57.685
I'll call
to reschedule.
No,
that's not the point.

17:57.728 --> 18:00.079
I didn't ask you to give
that interview. You offered.

18:00.122 --> 18:02.516
If you don't want
to be a part of my campaign,

18:02.559 --> 18:03.865
that's fine,
just tell me.

18:03.908 --> 18:06.041
That's not it.Then what is it?

18:06.085 --> 18:07.260
Why can't you
share with me

18:07.303 --> 18:08.652
what's really going on
in your life?

18:08.696 --> 18:10.872
I want to explain
all of this to you,

18:10.915 --> 18:12.700
but right now,
I just need you to trust me.

18:12.743 --> 18:15.703
Trust that I am making the right
decisions for both of us.

18:15.746 --> 18:17.487
I've beentrusting you,

18:17.531 --> 18:20.186
especially since
George got here.

18:20.229 --> 18:21.883
So, when are you gonna
start trusting me,Vanessa?

18:21.926 --> 18:23.450
I dotrust you,
Griffin.

18:23.493 --> 18:26.061
Baby...

18:26.105 --> 18:28.150
what was it
you said back there --

18:28.194 --> 18:30.718
"Our actions
speak for themselves"?

18:36.985 --> 18:39.379
It's not that I don't see
the appealof surgery,

18:39.422 --> 18:42.077
I just figured out very early on
that I'd be terrible at it.

18:42.121 --> 18:43.296
Oh, nonsense.

18:43.339 --> 18:45.559
You have
a surplus of talent.

18:45.602 --> 18:48.388
The rest is just practice,
repetition.

18:48.431 --> 18:50.781
Oh, no.
No way.

18:50.825 --> 18:53.088
What you do
is a form of performance.

18:53.132 --> 18:55.917
With my work, I spend
most of my time thinking.

18:55.960 --> 18:58.180
I wander
in 1,000 different directions,

18:58.224 --> 19:01.705
and then, only when
I'm as ready as I'll ever be,

19:01.749 --> 19:03.011
then I test.

19:03.054 --> 19:05.622
Yes, but if you don't like
how it goes,

19:05.666 --> 19:07.711
you test
a different way.

19:07.755 --> 19:08.886
Step and repeat.

19:08.930 --> 19:10.453
I don't get
that luxury.

19:10.497 --> 19:12.760
No, but you're
completely in the moment.

19:12.803 --> 19:15.328
You have a human being
lying in front of you --

19:15.371 --> 19:17.460
their body open,
their heart beating.

19:17.504 --> 19:18.461
It's...

19:20.028 --> 19:25.512
Yes, you have your talent
and your training,

19:25.555 --> 19:30.430
but it's your instinct,
your courage of precision.

19:30.473 --> 19:33.128
Mm.
Surgery is primal.

19:33.172 --> 19:36.436
I guess there is
an addictive quality to it,

19:36.479 --> 19:39.221
knowing that a life
is in you hands.

19:40.918 --> 19:42.137
There it is,

19:42.181 --> 19:43.660
the hero complex
I was talking about.

19:43.704 --> 19:46.402
Sometimes I fear the drive
to do what I do

19:46.446 --> 19:49.449
doesn't always come
from a place of heroism.

19:49.492 --> 19:51.059
Where does
it come from?

19:51.102 --> 19:54.149
It's about power,
isn't it?

19:54.193 --> 19:55.281
Control.

19:55.324 --> 19:57.457
Who lives, who dies.

19:57.500 --> 20:00.547
Whoo.

20:00.590 --> 20:03.289
Forgive me.

20:03.332 --> 20:05.247
Hey, I know
a lot of surgeons.

20:05.291 --> 20:07.336
At least
you're honest about it.

20:07.380 --> 20:10.861
Most are too egotistical
to truly see themselves.

20:12.341 --> 20:14.300
The only reason
our brains tell us we're flawed

20:14.343 --> 20:16.084
is so that we find a way
to be better.

20:16.127 --> 20:19.435
Besides...
there's nothing wrong

20:19.479 --> 20:22.699
with the occasional
evil thought.

20:28.270 --> 20:29.837
Somewhere you have to be?

20:29.880 --> 20:32.666
More like a deadline
I've promised to keep.

20:32.709 --> 20:33.971
Oh.

20:34.015 --> 20:35.277
Well...

20:35.321 --> 20:37.671
thanks for the drink.

20:39.238 --> 20:41.370
Leaving so soon?

20:41.414 --> 20:43.024
You just said
you have a deadline.

20:43.067 --> 20:46.027
Something tells me
I'm going to make it.

20:53.077 --> 20:54.905
This isn't your fault.

20:54.949 --> 20:57.299
Yes, it is --
all of it.

20:57.343 --> 20:59.040
I brought John here.

20:59.083 --> 21:00.737
Every person he harms,
it's my fault.

21:00.781 --> 21:02.522
How were you supposed to know
he was Jack the Ripper?

21:02.565 --> 21:03.914
That's not the point.

21:03.958 --> 21:06.352
He keeps killing people,
and I can't stop him.

21:06.395 --> 21:08.179
Every person he kills
alters the future.

21:08.223 --> 21:10.269
These people --
they're not supposed to die now.

21:10.312 --> 21:12.096
There's no telling
the damage it's caused

21:12.140 --> 21:13.272
or what
it's destroyed.

21:13.315 --> 21:14.577
But you'rehere.

21:14.621 --> 21:16.013
Aren't you
altering the timeline?

21:16.057 --> 21:17.406
Yes,
and I shouldn't be.

21:17.450 --> 21:19.887
Time travel is meant
for observation only.

21:20.931 --> 21:23.369
How can you be
so sure of that?

21:24.413 --> 21:27.416
We can talk science all day,
but I don't think

21:27.460 --> 21:31.725
you could take fate and destiny
out of the equation.

21:33.292 --> 21:36.904
I think you were always
supposed to come to New York.

21:36.947 --> 21:39.776
You and I were always
supposed to meet.

21:39.820 --> 21:43.258
Because if this is just
a mistake in the fabric of time,

21:43.302 --> 21:45.216
well,
that would just suck.

21:47.349 --> 21:49.177
That would suck.

21:50.352 --> 21:52.920
I'm sorry,
I am babbling so much.

21:52.963 --> 21:54.574
No.
No, no, no, never.

21:56.445 --> 21:58.926
When I met you,
um, I must admit,

21:58.969 --> 22:00.971
I was first drawn
to your beauty,

22:01.015 --> 22:04.105
the way you light up
by merely being.

22:04.148 --> 22:06.281
And then,
it was your kindness

22:06.325 --> 22:09.284
that emerged
as your most luminous feature.

22:09.328 --> 22:13.419
But now I see that you are
the sum of many parts,

22:13.462 --> 22:16.335
with your mind
leading the way.

22:17.727 --> 22:22.123
I am completely blinded
by you, Miss Walker --

22:22.166 --> 22:23.124
Jane.

22:28.172 --> 22:29.260
Sorry. Phone.

22:29.304 --> 22:30.697
Yes, I see that.

22:31.828 --> 22:33.221
It's my friend Paul.

22:33.264 --> 22:35.310
He may be able
to help us.

23:14.828 --> 23:17.439
If Paul is right
and he has the gemstone we need,

23:17.483 --> 23:19.746
we should be back at the
time machine within the hour.

23:19.789 --> 23:21.008
I have
long been fascinated

23:21.051 --> 23:22.531
by mechanically propelled
vehicles.

23:22.575 --> 23:24.838
Turn left at the next light.

23:24.881 --> 23:26.492
And it talks, too?

23:28.102 --> 23:29.451
This is amazing.

23:29.495 --> 23:31.932
I gather
that the speed of the vehicle

23:31.975 --> 23:33.890
is controlled
by that first foot lever, there.

23:33.934 --> 23:35.370
It's called a gas pedal.

23:35.414 --> 23:37.677
The other one is the brake,
for stopping.

23:37.720 --> 23:40.680
Tell me, Doug, how long
have you worked for Vanessa?

23:40.723 --> 23:42.421
13 years.

23:42.464 --> 23:45.249
I was head of security
at her company for eight years,

23:45.293 --> 23:48.557
then moved over to her personal
detail for the last five.

23:48.601 --> 23:50.559
Before that,
I was an army boy.

23:50.603 --> 23:52.909
Impressive.

24:03.267 --> 24:04.965
I'll wait here.

24:05.008 --> 24:06.880
You have my cell
if you need me.

24:06.923 --> 24:07.881
Thank you, Doug.

24:07.924 --> 24:10.971
Thank you.

24:23.766 --> 24:25.768
Jane,
how are you?

24:27.553 --> 24:29.642
It's good
to see you.Good to see you, too.

24:29.685 --> 24:31.382
Um, Paul, this is
my friend George.

24:31.426 --> 24:32.514
George,
this is Paul.

24:32.558 --> 24:33.863
Hi, there.Pleasure.

24:33.907 --> 24:36.083
Everyone's gone for the night.
It's just me.

24:36.126 --> 24:38.259
This way.

24:47.616 --> 24:48.922
Sorry to bother you,

24:48.965 --> 24:50.445
but I didn't know
who else to call.

24:50.489 --> 24:51.620
No problem.

24:51.664 --> 24:53.796
I was hoping
to hear from you someday.

24:53.840 --> 24:56.320
May I ask --
what is this place?It's the
Gemology Institute.

24:56.364 --> 24:57.757
Paul is a gemologist.

24:57.800 --> 25:00.194
Well, I mainly work
in trade now --

25:00.237 --> 25:01.761
rare rocks
and gemstones.

25:01.804 --> 25:04.372
You know, Coldplay was at
the Garden last week.

25:04.415 --> 25:05.547
I thought about you.

25:05.591 --> 25:07.331
Really, Coldplay?

25:07.375 --> 25:08.550
What is Coldplay?

25:08.594 --> 25:10.117
Coldplay is a band.

25:10.160 --> 25:12.772
They have this one album
that we both really like.

25:12.815 --> 25:15.862
You don't know Coldplay?No, I'm sorry.

25:15.905 --> 25:17.167
George is from London.

25:17.211 --> 25:18.865
So is Coldplay.

25:20.736 --> 25:22.999
So, you have
the alexandrite gemstone?Yeah.
It's right up here.

25:23.043 --> 25:25.567
You know, Jane,
you look really good.

25:25.611 --> 25:27.177
Thank you.
So do you.

25:28.483 --> 25:29.789
Crossfit.

25:29.832 --> 25:31.399
I've really been
working my core, you know,

25:31.442 --> 25:33.140
upping my game
at the gym.

25:34.533 --> 25:37.057
Shall we continue?

25:37.100 --> 25:39.320
Yeah.

25:56.555 --> 25:58.818
I don't have many
for you to choose from,

25:58.861 --> 26:01.037
but please put the gloves on
before you touch the stones.

26:01.081 --> 26:02.561
Take a look
at what's here.

26:02.604 --> 26:05.607
There may be a few more
in the safe.

26:07.740 --> 26:09.176
Is that
the right size?

26:09.219 --> 26:10.656
Uh...

26:10.699 --> 26:14.616
well, it needs to be type 1
with high clarity --

26:14.660 --> 26:16.096
like these.

26:16.139 --> 26:18.925
Knock yourself out.

26:18.968 --> 26:21.231
So, are you still
at the museum?

26:21.275 --> 26:23.190
I took
a couple weeks off.

26:23.233 --> 26:26.367
I'm doing some consulting
at Vanessa Anders' foundation.

26:26.410 --> 26:27.716
Awesome.
Yeah.

26:27.760 --> 26:29.849
Is that
what this is about?
Yeah.

26:29.892 --> 26:31.590
She's gonna cover
all the costs.
Great.

26:31.633 --> 26:35.768
So, uh, you and, um...

26:37.334 --> 26:38.379
George.

26:38.422 --> 26:40.903
George, yes --
a thing?

26:40.947 --> 26:44.124
I'll stop flirting with you
if it is.

26:44.167 --> 26:45.473
Oh, I doubt that.

26:45.516 --> 26:46.735
Excuse me?

26:46.779 --> 26:49.782
George and I are...

26:49.825 --> 26:51.305
friends.
Thought so.

26:52.349 --> 26:56.397
Uh, Paul, I am looking for
something with a level-six tone.

26:56.440 --> 26:59.922
Level six, got it.
I'll check the safe.

26:59.966 --> 27:02.882
If it's not
too much trouble.

27:07.016 --> 27:09.584
I'm sorry about that.

27:09.628 --> 27:11.717
Paul and I went out
on a few dates.

27:11.760 --> 27:13.632
I should've
mentioned that before.

27:13.675 --> 27:14.937
You went out
with him?

27:14.981 --> 27:16.635
You seem surprised.

27:17.723 --> 27:20.073
He -- He doesn't seem
your type.

27:20.116 --> 27:22.075
Really?

27:22.118 --> 27:23.729
And what is my type?

27:23.772 --> 27:28.951
Someone, uh,
a little less congratulatory.

27:30.474 --> 27:32.738
Ignore him.
He's just being a guy.

27:32.781 --> 27:35.262
He completely
lacks subtlety.

27:35.305 --> 27:38.265
Well, perhaps
it's all that crossfit.

27:45.315 --> 27:48.101
We went out a couple times
and nothing came out of it.

27:48.144 --> 27:49.102
No sparks.

27:49.145 --> 27:50.494
"Sparks?"

27:50.538 --> 27:52.932
You know...

27:52.975 --> 27:55.935
that electricity
between two people.

27:55.978 --> 27:59.025
That undefinable
spark of attraction.

27:59.068 --> 28:01.462
You must have
felt it before.

28:01.505 --> 28:03.029
You've been married.

28:03.072 --> 28:05.205
Yes, uh,
I wasmarried --

28:05.248 --> 28:07.468
"was" being
the operative word.

28:07.511 --> 28:09.470
What went wrong?

28:09.513 --> 28:13.300
Uh, Isabel never really
understood me.

28:13.343 --> 28:15.868
My passions to explore
and discover,

28:15.911 --> 28:18.044
they -- they held
no interest to her.

28:19.045 --> 28:21.308
And we both knew
it wasn't right.

28:24.006 --> 28:26.313
And how does one
find the right person?

28:27.836 --> 28:29.969
Or do theyfind us?

28:31.840 --> 28:34.495
Perhaps fate
does indeed play a hand.

28:35.539 --> 28:37.846
So, now you do
believe in fate.

28:42.155 --> 28:43.678
I know you had
a lot on your plate today.

28:43.722 --> 28:45.288
I really appreciate you
coming back.

28:45.332 --> 28:46.899
This is where
I want to be, Vanessa.

28:46.942 --> 28:50.163
I just -- I want to know
what's going on with you.

28:53.209 --> 28:55.168
Vanessa --
This isn't easy,
Griffin.

28:55.211 --> 28:56.996
Nothing about our relationship
has been easy,

28:57.039 --> 28:58.258
but I love you.

28:58.301 --> 28:59.694
Whatever it is,
I can handle it.

29:01.217 --> 29:06.005
What if I told you that George
is really H.G. Wells,

29:06.048 --> 29:08.398
who traveled here
in that time machine

29:08.442 --> 29:10.749
that is now sitting
in my ballroom?

29:13.229 --> 29:17.886
I would say,
"You've lost your damn mind."

29:21.629 --> 29:23.196
Oh, my God,
you're serious.

29:23.239 --> 29:25.415
Y-You can't possibly
believe this.

29:25.459 --> 29:27.113
This is why
I haven't told you.

29:27.156 --> 29:29.376
Sweetheart, this guy
is obviously playing you.

29:29.419 --> 29:31.073
Are you
giving him money?

29:31.117 --> 29:33.206
This is a DNA
and genealogy test.

29:33.249 --> 29:34.773
I had it done
on both of us.

29:34.816 --> 29:38.385
The results are conclusive --
we are related.

29:38.428 --> 29:40.039
You are
a very wealthy woman.

29:40.082 --> 29:42.737
People know about your
preoccupation with H.G. Wells

29:42.781 --> 29:44.391
and that you own
the exhibit.

29:44.434 --> 29:46.480
Now you have some punk
pretending to beWells

29:46.523 --> 29:47.655
living in your home.

29:47.698 --> 29:50.963
He's taking you
for a ride.

29:51.006 --> 29:52.616
I'm gonna
take care of this.

29:52.660 --> 29:54.183
Don't.

29:54.227 --> 29:56.403
I'm not gonna sit back and
watch him make a fool of you.

29:56.446 --> 29:59.058
I trusted you with this.
Now I need youto trust me.

29:59.101 --> 30:02.888
Vanessa, I'm really worried
about you right now.

30:02.931 --> 30:04.890
I don't know if I can.

30:12.811 --> 30:16.075
I know
why you're single.

30:16.118 --> 30:17.903
Oh, yeah?

30:17.946 --> 30:21.732
It's because you're a goddess
searching for your equal,

30:21.776 --> 30:23.996
and you'll settle
for no less.

30:28.478 --> 30:30.176
Mm.

30:32.656 --> 30:34.267
Uh-oh.

30:34.310 --> 30:36.922
Too intimate?

30:36.965 --> 30:39.272
Did I discover
another one of your issues?

30:39.315 --> 30:41.796
Perhaps you did.

30:41.840 --> 30:44.146
Well, then I guess
I won't be asking you

30:44.190 --> 30:45.278
to stay the night.

30:45.321 --> 30:47.280
Were you going to?

30:48.498 --> 30:53.460
It would be out of character
for me, but...

30:53.503 --> 30:55.201
yes.

30:55.244 --> 30:57.116
I was going to --

30:57.159 --> 31:00.728
if your intimacy issues
can handle it.

31:00.771 --> 31:04.297
Well, I think
they can handle it.

31:05.515 --> 31:07.082
I'm gonna go
make a drink.

31:07.126 --> 31:08.344
Would you like one?

31:08.388 --> 31:11.913
No, I'm good,
but you help yourself.

31:54.390 --> 31:57.219
I think I have
what you're looking for.

31:59.439 --> 32:01.963
Ah, thank you.

32:08.752 --> 32:10.885
This is
exactly what we need.

32:10.929 --> 32:12.626
You just need
to sign for it.

32:12.669 --> 32:14.062
Let me
get the papers.

32:14.106 --> 32:15.455
Thank you.

32:22.941 --> 32:26.379
Well...your friend
has redeemed himself.

32:26.422 --> 32:28.033
Oh, good.

32:36.171 --> 32:37.738
Did you hear that?

32:37.781 --> 32:40.045
Paul?

32:40.088 --> 32:41.568
Is everything all right?

32:49.315 --> 32:51.273
Paul!

32:53.362 --> 32:54.929
Follow me, this way.

32:54.973 --> 32:57.845
Go, go, go.

33:10.031 --> 33:12.164
This way.

33:16.037 --> 33:19.432
I know you're in here!

33:27.179 --> 33:30.182
I know who you are,
H.G. Wells.

33:30.225 --> 33:33.663
I know all about
your time machine.

33:34.664 --> 33:37.189
I know about
the Ripper, too.

33:37.232 --> 33:39.321
Go, go, go, go, go.

34:13.703 --> 34:15.488
Ow.

34:16.750 --> 34:19.057
No, no, no.

34:43.907 --> 34:45.344
Doug.

34:45.387 --> 34:46.910
Who's the guy?
I heard gunshots.

34:46.954 --> 34:48.608
I-I don't know, but I have
seen this man before.

34:48.651 --> 34:49.783
He was following me.

34:49.826 --> 34:51.176
You two
need to get out of here.

34:51.219 --> 34:52.177
I got this.

35:03.188 --> 35:04.624
Thank you. Paul will cooperate.

35:04.667 --> 35:07.366
I'll pay for the damage,
and he'll keep quiet.

35:07.409 --> 35:08.932
Paul's a good guy.
We can trust him.

35:08.976 --> 35:10.238
I still
do not understand

35:10.282 --> 35:12.197
why that man
was trying to kill me.

35:12.240 --> 35:14.112
How did he know me
and the Ripper?

35:14.155 --> 35:15.548
All these years,
I thought I was the only one

35:15.591 --> 35:16.984
who knew
you'd come to New York.

35:17.027 --> 35:18.899
Could he be someone
I have yet to encounter?

35:18.942 --> 35:20.553
Perhaps I met him
in myfuture,

35:20.596 --> 35:22.163
but his past.

35:22.207 --> 35:23.991
That wouldn't explain
why he wanted to shoot you.

35:24.034 --> 35:25.732
Doug has a contact
at the police department.

35:25.775 --> 35:27.125
He'll call
when they ID the body.

35:28.952 --> 35:30.432
It's Martin.

35:30.476 --> 35:33.218
He's ready for you
to install the new gemstone.

35:47.493 --> 35:50.670
Initiating remote
activation sequence now.

35:50.713 --> 35:53.107
Set the calibration
to bring the time machine back

35:53.151 --> 35:55.979
to this very location
a second after it launches

35:56.023 --> 35:58.025
in order to prevent
another break in the
time-space continuum.

35:59.461 --> 36:01.463
Vanessa?

36:01.507 --> 36:03.944
I believe everyone here
knows Griffin.

36:03.987 --> 36:06.729
Actions speak
for themselves.

36:06.773 --> 36:08.644
Well,
watch this.

36:15.738 --> 36:18.263
All the power levels are ready
to accept the parameters.

36:42.243 --> 36:43.549
No way.

36:43.592 --> 36:45.203
How?

36:45.246 --> 36:46.639
It's incredible.

36:48.554 --> 36:50.860
So, that's it?
The trap is ready?

36:50.904 --> 36:53.559
John can get in,
set whatever date he wants.

36:53.602 --> 36:55.430
He's only gonna go
where we want him to go.

36:55.474 --> 36:56.736
Great.

36:56.779 --> 36:58.781
Good evening, H.G.

36:58.825 --> 37:01.349
I'm sending you a movie.

37:01.393 --> 37:03.090
Not one you're going to enjoy,
I'm afraid,

37:03.133 --> 37:05.875
but I hope you'll at least
appreciate my clever application

37:05.919 --> 37:07.660
of modern technology.

37:07.703 --> 37:09.575
Though, unfortunately,

37:09.618 --> 37:12.230
I'm unable
to honor our deadline.

37:12.273 --> 37:15.537
I met a fascinating woman.

37:15.581 --> 37:18.105
In her company, I've...

37:18.148 --> 37:21.326
begun to feel all too...human.

37:22.370 --> 37:26.331
But as we both know,
what I truly am...

37:26.374 --> 37:27.854
is an animal.

37:27.897 --> 37:31.118
There is no redemption
for my soul,

37:31.161 --> 37:32.859
no matter the cost.

37:35.601 --> 37:39.039
Then,
I must be true to my nature.

37:39.082 --> 37:44.305
But perhaps, it will bring you
satisfaction to know that...

37:46.307 --> 37:49.919
...I willfeel regret.

37:49.963 --> 37:51.312
Hmm.

37:58.798 --> 38:00.713
It's late...

38:00.756 --> 38:04.064
♪ You're too much,
I can't take it ♪...to have music on.

38:04.107 --> 38:06.719
♪ You always seem
to make my heart stop ♪

38:06.762 --> 38:09.896
Oh, how do you still
have the energy?

38:09.939 --> 38:12.246
You inspire me.

38:35.356 --> 38:37.315
What did you do?

38:40.318 --> 38:43.190
Delete.

38:45.627 --> 38:47.629
It's about time.

38:49.152 --> 38:52.678
I was beginning to think
you'd gone soft.

38:52.721 --> 38:54.810
What have you done?

39:04.254 --> 39:06.692
Ooh, blimey.
Look at it.

39:06.735 --> 39:08.433
It's bursting
with energy.

39:08.476 --> 39:10.522
It's fully live
and operational,

39:10.565 --> 39:12.872
but John hasn't called.

39:12.915 --> 39:16.876
Do you think
he's gonna kill again?

39:16.919 --> 39:19.357
We shallcatch him.

39:19.400 --> 39:22.229
Today, when that man
had his gun pointed at you --

39:22.272 --> 39:24.884
that was real...

39:24.927 --> 39:26.842
too real.

39:27.843 --> 39:30.411
You want out.

39:30.455 --> 39:31.630
No.

39:31.673 --> 39:33.893
I want in.

39:33.936 --> 39:37.810
Yes, today was scary,
but it proved something --

39:37.853 --> 39:39.986
that I want
to do this.

39:40.029 --> 39:44.425
Because somehow,
I think I'm supposed to be here.

39:44.469 --> 39:46.384
You asked me
if I believe in fate.

39:46.427 --> 39:50.431
Well, Jane, I believe there are
certain moments in one's life

39:50.475 --> 39:52.433
that defy understanding.

39:52.477 --> 39:56.655
Moments that are rare
and special...

39:57.699 --> 39:59.527
...and precious.

39:59.571 --> 40:02.182
And this moment?

40:02.225 --> 40:03.749
Oh, I believe
very much so

40:03.792 --> 40:05.664
that this moment
was destined to happen.

40:10.756 --> 40:12.758
Did that
just happen?

40:12.801 --> 40:14.455
Well, it's merely
a thermionic emission

40:14.499 --> 40:16.675
of electrons
from the, uh --
Right.

40:33.474 --> 40:36.303
All good here.
Worked like a charm.

40:36.346 --> 40:39.262
I now have access
to the time machine.

40:40.742 --> 40:43.049
But there's a problem...

40:43.092 --> 40:45.921
someone else knows about Wells.

40:45.965 --> 40:48.881
We have to find out
who else is out there.

41:01.110 --> 41:04.244
Good evening,
Dr. Stevenson --

41:04.287 --> 41:06.942
or do you prefer
Jack the Ripper?

41:09.031 --> 41:10.642
Who are you?

41:10.685 --> 41:14.254
I'm someone who's been waiting
a very long time to meet you.

41:18.345 --> 41:21.261
Shh.
