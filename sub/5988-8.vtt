00:01.235 --> 00:02.401
<i> Previously on</i> Reign...

00:02.403 --> 00:04.336
NARCISSE:
"One rat down, two to go."

00:04.338 --> 00:06.238
Please stop the threats.

00:06.240 --> 00:09.008
The dead rat
you left in my bath.

00:09.010 --> 00:10.242
But not at my command.

00:10.244 --> 00:11.243
I know you're hungry, too.

00:11.245 --> 00:12.578
You want more?

00:12.580 --> 00:13.645
So take it.

00:14.749 --> 00:17.316
All those in favor
of holding a vote

00:17.318 --> 00:19.284
to confirm the queen
mother as regent.

00:19.286 --> 00:21.787
In this urn is proof our late
King Francis was murdered.

00:21.789 --> 00:23.455
The king's liver.

00:23.457 --> 00:25.624
Blackness demonstrates
he was poisoned.

00:25.626 --> 00:28.594
You think that I killed
my son to take power?

00:28.596 --> 00:30.729
France needs a leader.

00:30.731 --> 00:31.697
I will offer
myself.

00:31.699 --> 00:33.732
And all those in favor.

00:33.734 --> 00:36.168
I hope I will rule
my country well.

00:36.170 --> 00:37.803
If you don't marry Charles,
what will you do?

00:37.805 --> 00:39.772
Intelligence from Spain.

00:39.774 --> 00:42.241
Prince Don Carlos
is their next king,

00:42.243 --> 00:43.509
<i> and he has begun</i>
<i> looking for a wife.</i>

00:43.511 --> 00:45.411
DON CARLOS:
Some people call it
a sex horse.

00:45.413 --> 00:46.512
The device is for me.

00:47.415 --> 00:49.314
Mary! I trusted you!

00:49.316 --> 00:51.750
(gasping)

00:52.753 --> 00:54.453
What do we do now?

00:54.455 --> 00:57.056
I can still see the shard
of wood sticking out

00:57.058 --> 00:58.690
the back of his skull
and the blood everywhere.

00:58.692 --> 01:00.793
We should have stayed
with Don Carlos, not fled.

01:00.795 --> 01:02.594
Keep moving.
It's not too late
to go back.

01:02.596 --> 01:03.829
We could tell
everyone what happened.

01:03.831 --> 01:05.330
What if he dies?
Oh, you just pray

01:05.332 --> 01:07.499
that's exactly what
happens to him.

01:07.500 --> 01:09.667
His father is the most powerful,
most pious monarch in the world.

01:09.670 --> 01:12.071
The prince could easily
convince King Philip

01:12.073 --> 01:13.505
that that masochism
machine was something

01:13.507 --> 01:16.208
that you and Francis
used to use.

01:16.210 --> 01:17.609
That you introduced
it to the prince,

01:17.611 --> 01:20.446
and then you invited me
in as a participant.

01:20.448 --> 01:22.181
Nothing would save us
from the wrath of Spain.

01:22.183 --> 01:24.083
Until we know
Don Carlos' fate,

01:24.085 --> 01:26.218
we need to come up
with a story to cover

01:26.220 --> 01:27.753
our whereabouts
this evening just in case.

01:27.755 --> 01:30.089
Okay, okay, we were here.

01:30.091 --> 01:32.291
We were playing a game
of chess, which I won.

01:32.293 --> 01:33.859
Can your servants
refute that?

01:33.861 --> 01:36.128
Did anyone know
that you were visiting

01:36.130 --> 01:38.097
Don Carlos' chambers
this evening?
Uh, no.

01:38.099 --> 01:39.098
He likes to keep
his sexual tastes

01:39.100 --> 01:40.432
and everything surrounding them

01:40.434 --> 01:41.867
a well-guarded
secret.

01:41.869 --> 01:42.835
You've dragged your hem
through his blood.

01:42.837 --> 01:44.369
That has
to go, too.

01:50.211 --> 01:52.311
Now think.

01:52.313 --> 01:55.147
Did you leave any of your
other belongings behind?

01:55.149 --> 01:56.582
Oh, no.

01:56.584 --> 01:59.785
The blindfold I used
on Don Carlos was my sash.

01:59.787 --> 02:01.854
But I didn't
add it to my gown

02:01.856 --> 02:03.322
until after
my attendants had gone.

02:03.324 --> 02:05.224
No one can link it
back to me.

02:05.226 --> 02:07.159
What are you doing?

02:07.161 --> 02:08.160
I'm trying to manage
any additional jeopardy

02:08.162 --> 02:09.795
that I might face.

02:09.797 --> 02:11.230
I'm accused of poisoning my son.

02:11.232 --> 02:13.198
A stockpile of toxins

02:13.200 --> 02:15.400
and my expertise in their use
is not gonna help my cause.

02:15.402 --> 02:17.469
Your son died a hero,
not a victim.

02:17.471 --> 02:20.539
How can I help you fight
these accusations?

02:20.541 --> 02:21.840
Throw those into the fire.

02:21.842 --> 02:23.876
Don't inhale the smoke.

02:23.878 --> 02:25.878
I can't have another dead
monarch on my hands.

02:25.880 --> 02:28.147
(knocking on door)

02:28.149 --> 02:30.282
MAN:
Open up!

02:33.254 --> 02:34.720
In the name of the regent!
(knocking on door)

02:36.590 --> 02:39.224
Yes?

02:39.226 --> 02:41.360
May I enter?

02:41.362 --> 02:42.361
Do I have a choice?

02:42.363 --> 02:43.428
You're regent.

02:43.430 --> 02:45.264
Which is
why I'm here.

02:45.266 --> 02:46.899
In service of my new position.

02:46.901 --> 02:49.334
(scoffs)
One you stole from my grasp

02:49.336 --> 02:53.705
when you refused to defend me
against allegations of regicide.

02:53.707 --> 02:57.843
Cardinal Morel leveled
the allegations.

02:57.845 --> 02:59.778
I have the unhappy task
of heading up an inquest

02:59.780 --> 03:01.180
to determine whether there is

03:01.182 --> 03:02.948
enough proof
for you to stand trial.

03:02.950 --> 03:05.851
Well, then look no further
than my son, King Charles.

03:05.853 --> 03:08.921
He will testify I would
never do harm to Francis.

03:08.923 --> 03:11.890
The privy council has sent
Charles away to a safe location.

03:11.892 --> 03:14.927
(gasps)
Without Charles, she's
as good as convicted.

03:14.929 --> 03:16.595
It is neither my job
nor the king's to try her.

03:16.597 --> 03:18.363
That task belongs
to the...

03:18.365 --> 03:21.667
The<i> Parlement de Paris, </i>
the high court of France.

03:21.669 --> 03:23.602
I have no motive
to murder my son.

03:23.604 --> 03:25.470
And I have not said
that you did.

03:25.472 --> 03:28.207
Unfortunately,
others think differently.

03:28.209 --> 03:31.777
When Francis fell ill,
he had you locked in a dungeon.

03:31.779 --> 03:32.945
You were out of favor,
out of power.

03:32.947 --> 03:35.981
Your only hope
of regaining that power

03:35.983 --> 03:37.950
was if the king were dead.

03:37.952 --> 03:40.552
How could I poison my son
from behind bars?

03:40.554 --> 03:41.720
I hadn't the means.

03:41.722 --> 03:43.922
What did you say?

03:43.924 --> 03:45.891
Oh, good God, no.

03:45.893 --> 03:47.459
Stephan.

03:47.461 --> 03:49.628
I know that things have been
bad between us as of late,

03:49.630 --> 03:52.397
but we were
once friends.

03:52.399 --> 03:54.233
Lovers.

03:54.235 --> 03:57.236
Your incarceration would
suggest a lack of means...

03:57.238 --> 03:59.538
were it not for the rat
and the threatening note

03:59.540 --> 04:01.807
you ordered placed in my wife's
bath while you were imprisoned.

04:01.809 --> 04:04.643
I didn't. You know that.

04:04.645 --> 04:07.579
You're trying to put her
away forever.
I'm trying to protect France.

04:07.581 --> 04:10.649
You're trying to protect
your role as regent of France.

04:10.651 --> 04:12.584
Please, I beg of
you, do not do this.

04:12.586 --> 04:16.588
I'm sorry, but I cannot ignore
what happened to Lady Lola.

04:16.590 --> 04:18.490
She must be called
before the inquest.

04:18.492 --> 04:20.259
If she testifies

04:20.261 --> 04:22.261
that I orchestrated
that from behind bars,

04:22.263 --> 04:24.596
it would show that I was
capable of poisoning Francis

04:24.598 --> 04:27.332
by the same means,
when the truth is,

04:27.334 --> 04:29.034
you planted that rat,

04:29.036 --> 04:31.270
and then
you blamed me

04:31.272 --> 04:33.405
so you could scare that
silly girl into your arms.

04:33.407 --> 04:34.840
Guards.

04:37.278 --> 04:40.345
That is where she keeps
her poisons.

04:40.347 --> 04:44.483
Uh, for the integrity
of this investigation,

04:44.485 --> 04:46.051
please leave.

04:47.921 --> 04:50.922
I was not responsible
for that threat against Lola.

04:50.924 --> 04:52.758
I know.

04:52.760 --> 04:55.494
I recognize the glint in
Narcisse's eye when he lies.

04:55.496 --> 04:56.928
Although he did seem
oddly conflicted

04:56.930 --> 04:58.930
at the charges
against you.

04:58.932 --> 05:02.000
It's possible he didn't frame me
for Francis' death,

05:02.002 --> 05:03.935
but he'd certainly be happy
to see me hang

05:03.937 --> 05:05.370
by the tale of a rat.

05:05.372 --> 05:07.506
But if he's not behind
the poisoning conspiracy,

05:07.508 --> 05:10.309
what do I make of this?

05:10.311 --> 05:12.010
I slipped it
out of my apothecary

05:12.012 --> 05:13.712
before Narcisse arrived.

05:13.714 --> 05:16.315
It's oil of vitriol.

05:16.317 --> 05:18.016
It's a toxin, it darkens
a victim's liver,

05:18.018 --> 05:19.484
and it is not mine.

05:20.521 --> 05:22.521
It's not.

05:22.523 --> 05:24.856
Given that Francis'
liver was blackened.

05:24.858 --> 05:26.758
Do you think
Narcisse planted it?

05:27.895 --> 05:29.728
I don't know.

05:29.730 --> 05:31.730
It would be difficult.

05:31.732 --> 05:33.732
There are guards outside
your doors at all times.

05:33.734 --> 05:35.100
It's not like he's welcome
in your chambers.

05:37.071 --> 05:38.537
He has been welcome of late.

05:39.707 --> 05:41.340
We rekindled our affair.

05:41.342 --> 05:43.575
A liaison that's
clearly over now.

05:43.577 --> 05:46.578
What do you expect me to do
with this information?

05:46.580 --> 05:48.580
Lola is like a sister to me.

05:48.582 --> 05:51.983
Well, I understand if you
are no longer my ally.

05:51.985 --> 05:53.952
Leave me.

05:53.954 --> 05:55.954
Soon the castle will quake

05:55.956 --> 05:57.923
with the news
of Don Carlos' accident.

05:57.925 --> 06:00.092
His delegation of nobles
will look to blame someone,

06:00.094 --> 06:01.560
and it cannot be us.

06:01.562 --> 06:03.695
You must control this situation.

06:05.499 --> 06:08.500
Whatever Narcisse is guilty of,
his intentions are clear--

06:08.502 --> 06:10.736
he wants to keep you
from the regency.

06:12.639 --> 06:15.407
That's not what Francis wanted
or what France needs.

06:15.409 --> 06:17.642
I will talk
to Lola,

06:17.644 --> 06:19.478
see if I can convince her
that the rat was not your doing.

06:19.480 --> 06:20.879
It won't be easy.

06:20.881 --> 06:22.714
She's under Narcisse's thrall.

06:22.716 --> 06:25.984
Oh, unless you mention
his infidelity.

06:25.986 --> 06:28.387
I would be inflicting
unnecessary pain.

06:29.390 --> 06:30.455
I'll do it my way.

06:30.457 --> 06:34.760
Captioned by
 Media Access Group at WGBH 
access.wgbh.org

06:34.762 --> 06:37.596
You ask me to accept that
Stephan is responsible

06:37.598 --> 06:40.565
for Catherine's threat
because Catherine says so?

06:40.567 --> 06:43.001
If you testify that
Catherine put a hostile note

06:43.003 --> 06:44.403
and a dead rat in your bath

06:44.405 --> 06:46.405
while she was locked
in the dungeon,

06:46.407 --> 06:49.074
it will prove she had
the ability to poison her son.

06:49.076 --> 06:50.675
Well, who can say
that she didn't?

06:50.677 --> 06:52.744
You know Catherine would
never harm Francis.

06:52.746 --> 06:56.181
I don't fault you
for taking her side.

06:56.183 --> 06:58.016
Since you lost Francis,

06:58.018 --> 07:00.085
she has been a great support
in your hour of need.

07:00.087 --> 07:02.621
But Catherine has it
in for my husband.

07:02.623 --> 07:04.456
He broke her heart,
and she seethes

07:04.458 --> 07:06.091
because he will never
touch her again.

07:06.093 --> 07:08.927
Lola, think about it.

07:08.929 --> 07:11.797
Who would have the most
to gain from scaring you?

07:11.799 --> 07:14.800
Catherine. She wanted me to stay
away from Stephan, and I did.

07:14.802 --> 07:16.101
Until you married him.

07:16.103 --> 07:18.103
Is it any coincidence
that after the rat,

07:18.105 --> 07:20.105
you sought protection
in his arms?

07:20.107 --> 07:21.540
Enough of this.

07:21.542 --> 07:23.975
I know that I didn't wed
a perfect man,

07:23.977 --> 07:26.478
but if he did this, it would
make a mockery of our marriage.

07:26.480 --> 07:29.681
And I can't believe that
of my husband, I just can't.

07:33.220 --> 07:35.654
Your Majesty, if I may
introduce myself.

07:35.656 --> 07:37.055
Lord Cunningham.

07:37.057 --> 07:38.657
I know who you
are. My apologies.

07:38.659 --> 07:40.492
It's usually
my custom

07:40.494 --> 07:42.694
to greet my newly arrived
Scottish advisors,

07:42.696 --> 07:44.796
but I've been
somewhat busy tonight.

07:44.798 --> 07:47.199
I have pressing news
from home.

07:47.201 --> 07:49.201
As you know, blight
destroyed the barley crop

07:49.203 --> 07:51.036
in the southern region.

07:51.038 --> 07:52.671
Has my brother
James reallocated

07:52.673 --> 07:54.506
the country's grain
reserves, as I suggested?

07:54.508 --> 07:57.142
Yes, but retreating English
soldiers plundered the crops

07:57.144 --> 07:59.177
and took them
just over the border.

07:59.179 --> 08:00.879
Where Elizabeth has
amassed her troops.

08:00.881 --> 08:02.714
The Scots are starting to panic.

08:02.716 --> 08:04.883
Last week some men
crossed into England

08:04.885 --> 08:06.751
and raided the soldiers' camps
to get the barley back.

08:06.753 --> 08:10.489
They did not succeed, and eight
of our people were captured.

08:10.491 --> 08:14.059
I will resolve the food shortage
and the hostage situation,

08:14.061 --> 08:16.895
but right now I must check
on Don Carlos' condition.

08:16.897 --> 08:19.898
I heard of his injury
and pray for his survival.

08:19.900 --> 08:21.733
In the face
of English aggression,

08:21.735 --> 08:24.202
Scotland needs the strength an
alliance with Spain can provide.

08:24.204 --> 08:26.905
Spain is no longer an option.

08:35.916 --> 08:38.984
How is he?

08:38.986 --> 08:42.153
The shard was removed
from his skull, Your Majesty,

08:42.155 --> 08:44.289
and staunch weed poultices
stopped the bleeding,

08:44.291 --> 08:45.590
but I don't hold out hope.

08:46.527 --> 08:47.759
Queen Mary.

08:47.761 --> 08:50.762
I am Federico de Toledo,
Duke of Alba,

08:50.764 --> 08:52.264
head of Don Carlos'
marriage delegation.

08:52.266 --> 08:54.533
May we speak
privately?

08:56.537 --> 08:58.136
Once the prince passes,

08:58.138 --> 09:00.138
his father, King Philip,
will want to know every detail

09:00.140 --> 09:01.840
surrounding the death
of his son.

09:01.842 --> 09:04.242
Were you with him
this evening?
Briefly.

09:04.244 --> 09:06.244
But when the accident occurred
and the servants found him,

09:06.246 --> 09:07.913
I was with the queen mother.

09:09.883 --> 09:11.883
Piety prevents me from going
into detail with a woman;

09:11.885 --> 09:16.755
however, we found a strange...
device in Don Carlos' chambers.

09:16.757 --> 09:19.224
One that could only
be used for...
I was made aware.

09:19.226 --> 09:22.093
French court is infamous
for its debauchery.

09:22.095 --> 09:23.628
Fornication seems
to be the order of the day.

09:23.630 --> 09:25.797
And what are you getting at?
The son of King Philip,

09:25.799 --> 09:28.233
defender of the faith,
would not sink to such depravity

09:28.235 --> 09:30.235
unless someone
in this castle corrupted him.

09:30.237 --> 09:32.604
I hear there is
a fallen lady-in-waiting

09:32.606 --> 09:34.039
who oversees
the courtesans here.

09:34.041 --> 09:35.740
Would you be kind enough
to bring her to me

09:35.742 --> 09:36.942
for interrogation?
(groaning)

09:36.944 --> 09:39.611
(physician speaks indistinctly)

09:39.613 --> 09:40.912
PHYSICIAN:
His brain is swelling.

09:40.914 --> 09:42.047
I must relieve the pressure.

09:44.217 --> 09:46.918
You must remain by
your prince's side.

09:46.920 --> 09:49.721
I will make inquiries
and report back.

09:49.723 --> 09:52.624
GREER:<i> Leave the castle</i>
<i> with my girls within the hour?</i>

09:52.626 --> 09:55.160
I'd have better luck getting
geese to dance the galliard.

09:55.162 --> 09:56.828
Besides, I've spoken
to my ladies.

09:56.830 --> 09:58.597
None of them entertained
Don Carlos this evening.

09:58.599 --> 09:59.965
It doesn't matter.

09:59.966 --> 10:01.332
The duke of Alba
is so intimidating,

10:01.335 --> 10:03.335
I believe he could wring
a confession from someone

10:03.337 --> 10:04.970
whether they were
guilty or not.

10:04.972 --> 10:06.972
And I won't have an innocent
punished for this.

10:06.974 --> 10:08.373
We shall pack immediately.

10:09.776 --> 10:11.776
Greer?

10:11.778 --> 10:13.078
What's different about you?

10:13.080 --> 10:14.646
Nothing.

10:14.648 --> 10:16.915
No.

10:16.917 --> 10:18.750
Something has changed.

10:18.752 --> 10:20.185
Uh, well, I am
wearing a new gown.

10:20.187 --> 10:21.653
Oh, that must be it.

10:23.390 --> 10:26.992
Mary, I know the discovery
about Don Carlos is painful,

10:26.994 --> 10:28.793
but it is better to have learned
the truth about his interests

10:28.795 --> 10:30.261
before you were
bound by marriage.

10:30.263 --> 10:32.330
I don't judge him for that.
Neither do I.

10:32.332 --> 10:34.099
But...

10:34.101 --> 10:36.334
a servant said she heard
two women pleasuring him

10:36.336 --> 10:37.402
before he collapsed in the hall.

10:37.404 --> 10:39.871
Two women?

10:39.873 --> 10:42.040
To think he was capable of that
whilst courting you.

10:42.042 --> 10:44.843
Has anyone
identified the voices?
No.

10:44.845 --> 10:46.277
But it's only a matter of time.

10:46.279 --> 10:48.013
Secrets don't stay secrets.

10:48.015 --> 10:49.681
And Spain is Spain.

10:49.683 --> 10:51.182
If they can colonize
half the globe,

10:51.184 --> 10:52.417
they can certainly find

10:52.419 --> 10:54.052
the two women
who destroyed their heir.

10:59.359 --> 11:00.325
(door creaks)

11:00.327 --> 11:02.293
I've come to
say good night.

11:02.295 --> 11:04.729
Resume your post.

11:04.731 --> 11:05.930
(door closes)

11:05.932 --> 11:07.198
That's not your usual guard.

11:07.200 --> 11:09.267
My mother is accused
of poisoning

11:09.269 --> 11:10.869
and suddenly
I have night guards,

11:10.871 --> 11:13.772
day guards,
guards for every hour.

11:13.774 --> 11:16.708
I was just summoned
to the inquest tomorrow.

11:16.710 --> 11:19.077
Do you think it will occur
to them to ask point-blank

11:19.079 --> 11:21.079
if you poisoned any
of your other children?

11:21.081 --> 11:22.747
You know I wasn't in my right
mind when that happened.

11:22.749 --> 11:24.249
I was being poisoned myself.

11:24.251 --> 11:25.684
Which comforts
me little.

11:25.686 --> 11:27.152
Claude, you
must realize

11:27.154 --> 11:28.286
I didn't lift a finger
against Francis...

11:28.288 --> 11:29.320
Of course
you didn't.

11:29.322 --> 11:31.222
You would never hurt Francis.

11:31.224 --> 11:33.692
He was your favorite, but me...

11:34.394 --> 11:35.694
Oh, Claude...

11:41.702 --> 11:43.268
From the moment you were born,

11:43.270 --> 11:45.704
our relationship
has been complicated.

11:45.706 --> 11:47.439
We live in a world

11:47.441 --> 11:49.808
that undervalues women.

11:49.810 --> 11:52.177
I may be guilty

11:52.179 --> 11:54.746
of favoring my sons
over my daughters...

11:54.748 --> 11:56.448
You<i> may</i> be guilty?

11:56.450 --> 11:58.817
I am nothing to you
but an annoyance,

11:58.819 --> 12:00.418
a problem to be managed,

12:00.420 --> 12:02.320
a thing to be given away
in marriage.

12:02.322 --> 12:04.022
Oh, you are
a handful,

12:04.024 --> 12:06.257
but I love you, I swear.

12:06.259 --> 12:09.060
And when you're wed
and you leave this home,

12:09.062 --> 12:10.428
you'll break my heart.

12:10.430 --> 12:12.497
I will beg for
word from you--

12:12.499 --> 12:14.332
for a letter,
for a visit--

12:14.334 --> 12:17.769
just as I am begging
for your forgiveness now.

12:19.406 --> 12:21.072
Fine.

12:21.074 --> 12:23.041
I won't tell them of
how you poisoned me...

12:23.043 --> 12:24.509
Thank you.

12:24.511 --> 12:25.944
...if you convince Charles
to allow me

12:25.946 --> 12:27.345
to choose my own husband.

12:27.347 --> 12:29.214
Since when did you want
to get married?

12:29.216 --> 12:32.250
I am only saying,
<i> if</i> I were to get married,

12:32.252 --> 12:33.885
I want to choose
the man.

12:33.887 --> 12:35.286
Will you speak to the king?

12:35.288 --> 12:37.522
I will.
Do you have someone in mind?

12:38.792 --> 12:41.092
Good night,
Mother.

12:45.766 --> 12:46.798
The prince's
seizures continue.

12:46.800 --> 12:48.366
He will soon
meet his maker.

12:48.368 --> 12:50.135
I am so sorry.

12:50.137 --> 12:51.536
Were you able
to learn anything more

12:51.538 --> 12:52.937
from the castle's madam?

12:52.939 --> 12:54.939
Yes.

12:54.941 --> 12:58.443
Don Carlos brought
the sexual device

12:58.445 --> 13:00.078
with him to court.

13:00.080 --> 13:02.280
There was a crate,
perfectly sized

13:02.282 --> 13:04.816
to house the apparatus,
found with his luggage.

13:04.818 --> 13:07.385
It's made from the wood
of the pinsapo fir--

13:07.387 --> 13:09.554
a tree native to your homeland.

13:11.224 --> 13:13.558
Oh.

13:13.560 --> 13:15.493
You know

13:15.495 --> 13:18.830
about Don Carlos'...
proclivities.

13:18.832 --> 13:20.899
Though the prince
himself is unaware,

13:20.901 --> 13:23.001
my colleagues and I
have spent years

13:23.003 --> 13:25.136
keeping the truth of
his bedroom hobbies suppressed.

13:25.138 --> 13:27.806
We have hidden the prince's
predilections from King Philip

13:27.808 --> 13:30.308
for fear that he would
disown his son...

13:30.310 --> 13:32.977
our only heir to the throne.

13:32.979 --> 13:35.480
We must protect
the Spanish line of succession.

13:35.482 --> 13:37.199
And yourselves.

13:37.200 --> 13:38.917
The king would have you
burned for heresy

13:38.919 --> 13:40.885
for enabling his son's impulses.

13:40.887 --> 13:42.854
What will you do
with this information?

13:42.856 --> 13:45.223
Nothing.

13:45.225 --> 13:47.592
I'm in the market for a
husband and want to remain

13:47.594 --> 13:49.894
as far removed from scandal
as possible.

13:49.896 --> 13:51.496
You are very kind.

13:51.498 --> 13:53.431
What will you tell King Philip

13:53.433 --> 13:57.836
of the circumstances surrounding
his son's tragic fate?

13:59.506 --> 14:01.906
While out
on a stroll,

14:01.908 --> 14:04.475
the prince saw
a patch of wildflowers

14:04.477 --> 14:05.977
and wanted to pick
some for you.

14:05.979 --> 14:07.245
He climbed a wall,

14:07.247 --> 14:08.880
slipped, and
cracked his skull.

14:08.882 --> 14:11.482
All for the love
of his loyal Queen Mary.

14:11.484 --> 14:13.885
So be it.

14:16.289 --> 14:18.356
(indistinct chatter)

14:19.626 --> 14:20.992
Well, next time,
you'll have to join me.

14:20.994 --> 14:22.260
It's much better with two faces.

14:22.262 --> 14:24.295
(laughter)

14:24.297 --> 14:26.297
Good day, lads.
Hello, boys.

14:26.299 --> 14:28.266
Why don't you come over here?

14:28.268 --> 14:29.968
My friend and I
have a wager.

14:29.970 --> 14:31.603
She said you stand
up all night...

14:31.605 --> 14:33.137
You are an accused
murderer.

14:33.139 --> 14:34.272
You're not to
leave this castle.

14:34.274 --> 14:35.874
I was doing no such thing.

14:35.876 --> 14:37.609
Members of your flying squad.

14:37.611 --> 14:38.877
You used them
as a diversion.

14:38.879 --> 14:41.112
Unhand me!

14:41.114 --> 14:42.614
Mary came to me,
suggested I offer my assistance.

14:42.616 --> 14:43.982
I am on your side, Catherine.

14:43.984 --> 14:47.619
Now, act the part
of a woman detained.

14:47.621 --> 14:49.988
Someone engineers
your ruin.

14:49.990 --> 14:51.222
We must stop it.

14:51.224 --> 14:52.490
How can I help?

14:52.492 --> 14:53.958
Well, I have a theory,

14:53.960 --> 14:55.560
but it requires travel
from the castle,

14:55.562 --> 14:56.628
something I clearly cannot do.

14:56.630 --> 14:58.663
Where?
I will go in your stead.

15:00.934 --> 15:02.567
Ride to the cathedral
at Saint-Denis

15:02.569 --> 15:04.269
where Francis is interred.

15:04.271 --> 15:07.639
Find the embalmer
who removed the king's organs.

15:07.641 --> 15:09.941
Ask him if the liver

15:09.943 --> 15:11.209
was already black
when he removed it.

15:11.211 --> 15:12.477
If it wasn't...

15:12.479 --> 15:13.945
That means the liver
was tampered with

15:13.947 --> 15:15.113
after Francis' death,

15:15.115 --> 15:16.281
which proves he wasn't poisoned

15:16.283 --> 15:17.682
and that you are innocent.

15:17.684 --> 15:20.485
You are offering me
a kindness and consideration

15:20.487 --> 15:22.921
I have rarely shown you
through the years. Why?

15:22.923 --> 15:25.056
Someone recently
came into my life.

15:25.058 --> 15:27.492
She taught me to trust
where my feelings lead me.

15:27.494 --> 15:29.327
I feel love toward
my dead brother

15:29.329 --> 15:31.095
and anger that people think
you could harm him.

15:31.097 --> 15:33.665
Those feelings lead me
to stand here with you.

15:34.935 --> 15:36.301
Thank you, Sebastian.

15:39.973 --> 15:41.639
Queen Mother,
you said if there was

15:41.641 --> 15:43.341
any change in the prince
of Spain's condition,

15:43.343 --> 15:45.009
I should tell you first.

15:45.011 --> 15:47.011
Don Carlos is going to survive.

15:47.013 --> 15:48.613
I mean, he's
still unconscious,

15:48.615 --> 15:50.448
but the physician said
that the worst is past.

15:50.450 --> 15:51.649
It's a miracle.

15:51.651 --> 15:52.717
And our downfall.

15:52.719 --> 15:54.419
When he wakes
and discovers

15:54.421 --> 15:55.653
that his sexual practices

15:55.655 --> 15:56.988
are no longer secret,

15:56.990 --> 15:58.723
he is going to do
everything he can

15:58.725 --> 16:00.658
to ensure that his father
doesn't brand him a deviant

16:00.660 --> 16:02.160
and disown him.

16:02.162 --> 16:04.028
He's gonna tell
a different story.

16:04.030 --> 16:05.697
One where all of this
was our doing.

16:05.699 --> 16:08.333
And the duke of Alba is going to
want to save his skin, as well.

16:08.335 --> 16:10.735
He will say anything the prince
of Spain tells him to.

16:10.737 --> 16:12.437
There's but one solution.

16:12.439 --> 16:14.072
We kill Don Carlos ourselves.

16:14.074 --> 16:16.407
Catherine, no.

16:16.409 --> 16:18.009
He was kind and honest to me

16:18.011 --> 16:19.677
and he doesn't deserve to die.

16:20.647 --> 16:22.714
(exhales)

16:24.084 --> 16:25.717
I will be there
when he wakes up.

16:25.719 --> 16:27.652
I will tell him
that I felt nervous

16:27.654 --> 16:29.587
about our first try at intimacy

16:29.589 --> 16:30.655
and I brought you
as moral support.

16:30.657 --> 16:32.290
I will make it
clear to him

16:32.292 --> 16:33.591
that I never wanted him

16:33.593 --> 16:35.727
to feel betrayed or humiliated.

16:35.729 --> 16:37.095
That is not a strategy.

16:37.097 --> 16:38.663
No, it's the truth.

16:38.665 --> 16:41.165
And it's the only way
we might gain his forgiveness.

16:44.304 --> 16:46.304
The note you found,

16:46.306 --> 16:48.439
that accompanied
the dead creature,

16:48.441 --> 16:50.041
read "One rat down,

16:50.043 --> 16:51.743
two to go"?

16:51.745 --> 16:53.411
How did you take that?

16:53.413 --> 16:55.213
LOLA:
As evidence

16:55.215 --> 16:57.415
that even from inside
her locked cell,

16:57.417 --> 16:59.784
Catherine de Medici's
reach was long.

17:01.121 --> 17:03.321
Thank you.

17:03.323 --> 17:05.023
That will be
all for today.

17:08.028 --> 17:11.329
Reliving such trauma
can't be easy.

17:11.331 --> 17:13.531
I admire you,
Lady Lola.

17:13.533 --> 17:15.233
Thank you, Cardinal Morel.

17:16.469 --> 17:18.136
Cedric, would you
make sure that the panel

17:18.138 --> 17:20.304
receives a copy
of that interview?

17:22.042 --> 17:23.074
(exhales)

17:23.076 --> 17:24.409
Are you all right?

17:24.411 --> 17:26.077
I thought it would feel good,

17:26.079 --> 17:27.812
driving a nail into her coffin.

17:27.814 --> 17:29.280
But as I was
telling my story,

17:29.282 --> 17:30.515
I suddenly realized

17:30.517 --> 17:32.517
I have no solid proof
against Catherine.

17:32.519 --> 17:35.186
A sign of her genius.

17:35.188 --> 17:36.754
Lola, what are
your doubts?

17:36.756 --> 17:38.556
Mary mentioned
something last night

17:38.558 --> 17:40.425
and I can't get it
out of my head.

17:40.427 --> 17:42.060
She said

17:42.062 --> 17:43.561
that it was you, not Catherine,

17:43.563 --> 17:45.063
who planted the rat in my tub,

17:45.065 --> 17:47.231
as a way of scaring me
into marrying you.

17:47.233 --> 17:49.600
And what was your response?

17:49.602 --> 17:52.236
That I was standing by you.

17:52.238 --> 17:54.338
Then why don't you
seem convinced?

17:55.742 --> 17:57.708
It's true,
I have done many

17:57.710 --> 17:59.577
unscrupulous things

17:59.579 --> 18:01.212
in the pursuit of what I want,

18:01.214 --> 18:03.281
but let me
be clear...

18:03.283 --> 18:07.185
I did not terrorize you
into becoming my bride.

18:08.188 --> 18:09.520
We wed

18:09.522 --> 18:11.589
because we love each other.

18:11.591 --> 18:13.591
(door closes)

18:19.532 --> 18:21.666
(door closes)
It's from my mother.

18:21.668 --> 18:23.534
We haven't spoken
since I was disowned

18:23.536 --> 18:25.369
for having John
out of wedlock.

18:25.371 --> 18:27.538
It must be urgent.

18:27.540 --> 18:29.574
It is.

18:29.576 --> 18:31.542
A group of Scots raided
an English troop encampment

18:31.544 --> 18:34.612
to take back some stolen grain
and were captured.

18:34.614 --> 18:38.149
Stephan, my father and brothers
are among the hostages.

18:38.151 --> 18:41.652
My mother fears Queen Elizabeth
will make an example of them.

18:41.654 --> 18:44.856
She wants me to appeal
to Mary on their behalf.

18:44.858 --> 18:48.526
Your family
will be returned safely.

18:48.528 --> 18:50.695
This I swear,

18:50.697 --> 18:52.697
as your husband

18:52.699 --> 18:54.732
and as ruler of France.

19:02.142 --> 19:03.875
What are you doing?

19:03.877 --> 19:05.476
Well, if your plan doesn't work

19:05.478 --> 19:06.777
I want to shove this cloth
down his throat.

19:06.779 --> 19:09.347
Catherine, unhand that rag.

19:09.349 --> 19:11.415
(murmurs)

19:11.417 --> 19:13.651
He's waking up.

19:15.622 --> 19:17.221
Don Carlos?

19:18.725 --> 19:19.924
What happened?

19:19.926 --> 19:21.559
You suffered
an accident.

19:21.561 --> 19:22.927
Do you remember

19:22.929 --> 19:25.163
how you got here

19:25.165 --> 19:26.831
or how you hurt yourself?

19:26.833 --> 19:29.200
I remember...

19:30.737 --> 19:31.869
Mary.

19:35.475 --> 19:38.276
What about her, Don Carlos?

19:38.278 --> 19:39.677
Mary...

19:40.613 --> 19:41.913
Pretty.

19:43.616 --> 19:44.682
Pretty Mary.

19:45.785 --> 19:47.685
If he's paying you a compliment,

19:47.687 --> 19:50.655
he can't possibly remember
what happened last night.

19:50.657 --> 19:52.323
Don Carlos?

19:52.325 --> 19:54.959
Do you remember Mary coming
to your chambers last night?

19:54.961 --> 19:58.262
What you asked her to do?

20:03.536 --> 20:05.636
You are so...

20:05.638 --> 20:08.206
pretty,

20:08.208 --> 20:09.774
Mary.

20:10.977 --> 20:12.710
He's been
rendered an idiot.

20:12.712 --> 20:14.912
MARY:
He can't follow
the conversation.

20:16.349 --> 20:17.648
The fall-- the damage
to his brain

20:17.650 --> 20:21.219
is too much. He's been impaired.

20:21.221 --> 20:24.488
For our sake, let's
hope it's permanent.

20:32.532 --> 20:34.498
Those Scots crossed the border
and attacked English soldiers.

20:34.500 --> 20:36.601
To retrieve barley
that was stolen from them.

20:36.603 --> 20:38.736
They are facing famine.
They had every right.

20:38.738 --> 20:40.371
I want them released.

20:40.373 --> 20:41.606
Queen Elizabeth
will release the captives

20:41.608 --> 20:43.374
under one condition.

20:43.376 --> 20:45.543
Lady Lola
is to visit English court.

20:45.545 --> 20:47.345
Lola?

20:47.347 --> 20:48.746
What does
Elizabeth

20:48.748 --> 20:50.514
want with one of my ladies?

20:50.516 --> 20:51.716
Were you hoping we weren't aware

20:51.718 --> 20:52.984
Lady Lola's father
and three brothers

20:52.986 --> 20:54.418
were among those captured?

20:54.420 --> 20:56.387
We will not send
my wife to England

20:56.389 --> 20:58.022
in what amounts
to a hostage swap.

20:58.024 --> 20:59.857
Well, I see it
as an olive branch.

20:59.859 --> 21:01.759
Through Lady Lola,
the queen of Scotland

21:01.761 --> 21:04.262
will get to know her
royal English cousin better.

21:04.264 --> 21:06.631
We reject your offer,
Ambassador.

21:06.633 --> 21:08.499
It's the only one Elizabeth
is willing to make.

21:08.501 --> 21:09.767
You have one
week to get

21:09.769 --> 21:11.802
Lady Lola to England;
if not,

21:11.804 --> 21:14.405
the prisoners will be hanged.

21:18.645 --> 21:20.444
As soon as the captives
are located,

21:20.446 --> 21:21.812
I will send
in a small military unit.

21:21.814 --> 21:23.681
Fast, aggressive, clean.

21:23.683 --> 21:25.549
The Elite Gendarmerie
would be ideal,

21:25.551 --> 21:28.653
but they are currently subduing
a revolt in the mountains.

21:28.655 --> 21:30.921
That leaves the Scots Guard
as our only option.

21:30.923 --> 21:33.924
Don't let Elizabeth bait us
into a belligerent move

21:33.926 --> 21:36.027
that could destroy
the tenuous peace

21:36.029 --> 21:37.795
in Scotland.

21:37.797 --> 21:39.630
We must find
a diplomatic strategy.

21:39.632 --> 21:41.532
I am regent.

21:41.534 --> 21:43.534
I will handle this situation
as I see fit.

21:43.536 --> 21:46.804
This situation involves
my Scottish subjects.

21:46.806 --> 21:49.840
It involves
my wife's family.

21:49.842 --> 21:51.475
And I will not
have you interfere

21:51.477 --> 21:53.411
in my political
or personal matters any longer.

21:53.413 --> 21:55.479
"Personal matters"?

21:55.481 --> 21:57.948
You told my wife that I planted
the dead rat in her bath.

21:57.950 --> 22:01.319
That gross untruth has caused
her tremendous pain.

22:01.321 --> 22:02.653
That was not my intent.

22:02.655 --> 22:03.788
I love Lola, which is why

22:03.790 --> 22:05.723
I didn't tell her
one other thing.

22:05.725 --> 22:06.857
That you and Catherine

22:06.859 --> 22:08.726
have rekindled your affair.

22:08.728 --> 22:10.661
That's ludicrous.

22:10.663 --> 22:12.430
It explains your reckless plan
to save Lola's family.

22:12.432 --> 22:13.931
You're trying
to ease your guilt.

22:13.933 --> 22:15.800
Your accusations
are based on the lies

22:15.802 --> 22:17.735
of Catherine de Medici,

22:17.737 --> 22:18.969
a jilted,

22:18.971 --> 22:20.905
desperate, poisonous woman

22:20.907 --> 22:23.074
who wants me to be as miserable

22:23.076 --> 22:26.577
and unloved as she is.

22:26.579 --> 22:28.813
Now, as the Scots Guard
are a joint military unit

22:28.815 --> 22:31.415
in service of France,
I am sending those soldiers in

22:31.417 --> 22:33.651
to rescue the hostages.

22:33.653 --> 22:37.121
Those particular Scots
may serve France,

22:37.123 --> 22:40.624
but they obey me, their queen.

22:40.626 --> 22:42.593
And I will order
them to stand down

22:42.595 --> 22:46.597
until all diplomatic paths
have been exhausted.

22:55.808 --> 22:56.941
It's been days.

22:56.943 --> 22:58.876
Has he improved?

22:58.878 --> 23:00.811
While he grapples
for common words,

23:00.813 --> 23:02.780
his language does
seem to be returning.

23:02.782 --> 23:05.149
However, he has lost much
of the use of his right side.

23:05.151 --> 23:08.085
We've been told not to expect
much more for his recovery.

23:08.087 --> 23:11.455
He remembers nothing
of his accident.

23:11.457 --> 23:13.858
The only thing he recalls
from his time at French court

23:13.860 --> 23:16.427
is his fondness
for music and you.

23:16.429 --> 23:17.595
"Pretty Queen Mary"

23:17.597 --> 23:19.397
is all he can speak of.

23:19.399 --> 23:23.067
The physician said that some
fresh air might be therapeutic.

23:23.069 --> 23:25.469
May I take Don Carlos
out to the gardens?

23:25.471 --> 23:26.737
No.

23:26.739 --> 23:28.739
He is to be seen by no one

23:28.741 --> 23:30.875
until his father King Philip
decides what to do with his son.

23:30.877 --> 23:32.710
You hide your prince
out of shame?

23:32.712 --> 23:34.779
Spain is the mightiest country
on Earth.

23:34.781 --> 23:38.549
Our royals must present
an image of strength and vigor.

23:46.058 --> 23:47.725
Here you go.

23:47.727 --> 23:48.859
It's all right.

23:51.731 --> 23:53.864
I want to go with Mary.

23:53.866 --> 23:57.201
Won't you reconsider, Duke?

23:57.203 --> 23:59.003
I have my orders.

24:02.475 --> 24:04.542
Why am I summoned a second time?

24:04.544 --> 24:05.643
I've answered
your questions.

24:05.645 --> 24:06.811
You did, Princess.

24:06.813 --> 24:08.512
But after
your last session,

24:08.514 --> 24:11.549
we noted that some of your
responses seemed, uh,

24:11.551 --> 24:12.850
unsure.

24:12.852 --> 24:14.985
So, to determine why
you may have felt

24:14.987 --> 24:16.987
uncomfortable with
your testimony,

24:16.989 --> 24:18.989
I spoke with
your ladies in waiting,

24:18.991 --> 24:21.058
one of whom told me that you
keep a very detailed diary.

24:21.060 --> 24:22.226
Is this it?

24:22.228 --> 24:23.994
You searched my chambers!

24:23.996 --> 24:25.663
Please answer the question.

24:26.899 --> 24:29.233
Yes, that is my diary.

24:29.235 --> 24:31.001
Very well, then.

24:31.003 --> 24:34.872
Before I go further, I would
like to offer you the chance

24:34.874 --> 24:36.841
to amend your
previous statement

24:36.843 --> 24:38.242
that your mother,
Catherine de Medici,

24:38.244 --> 24:40.611
would not,
under any circumstances,

24:40.613 --> 24:43.080
poison one of her children.

24:43.082 --> 24:45.216
If you're asking again
if my mother poisoned Francis,

24:45.218 --> 24:46.951
she did not.

24:49.722 --> 24:51.021
For the sake of expediency,

24:51.023 --> 24:54.024
I will now read aloud
from the journal.

24:54.026 --> 24:56.527
"I confronted Mother
about her poisonous soup.

24:56.529 --> 24:59.930
Asked her why she felt
that I deserved to die."

24:59.932 --> 25:02.066
Those are my personal thoughts
and feelings! You have no right!

25:02.068 --> 25:04.768
"I grabbed the poison she used
on me, put it to my lips,

25:04.770 --> 25:07.171
"hoping that she would finally
see the excruciating pain

25:07.173 --> 25:09.106
that she had caused me my
whole life."
Stop!

25:09.108 --> 25:10.541
Claude, are these words true?

25:10.543 --> 25:12.042
And remember that
lying in front

25:12.044 --> 25:13.110
of this inquest will have you

25:13.112 --> 25:15.012
sent to the high court, as well.

25:15.014 --> 25:18.148
So, I will ask again.

25:18.150 --> 25:19.650
Is it true?

25:19.652 --> 25:22.853
Did your mother
try to take your life?

25:22.855 --> 25:24.722
(door opens)

25:24.724 --> 25:26.690
(crying)

25:26.692 --> 25:27.758
Oh.

25:28.928 --> 25:31.195
What did you
do to her?

25:31.197 --> 25:32.796
We have her diary, Catherine.

25:32.798 --> 25:33.964
Forgive me, Mother.

25:33.966 --> 25:36.166
You did nothing wrong.

25:36.168 --> 25:38.035
Catherine de Medici,

25:38.037 --> 25:39.270
in light
of this revelation

25:39.272 --> 25:41.005
that you poisoned
your own daughter,

25:41.007 --> 25:42.840
we find that there is
enough evidence to conclude

25:42.842 --> 25:44.708
that you could have poisoned
your son.

25:44.710 --> 25:45.543
You are

25:45.545 --> 25:46.810
hereby commanded

25:46.812 --> 25:48.846
to face the<i> Parlement de Paris,</i>

25:48.848 --> 25:50.047
to be
tried

25:50.049 --> 25:51.749
for the murder of King Francis.

25:51.751 --> 25:53.117
(crying)

25:53.119 --> 25:54.118
CATHERINE:
There, there, now.

26:04.063 --> 26:05.763
(crickets chirp, owl hoots)

26:05.765 --> 26:07.097
(grunts)

26:08.601 --> 26:11.035
Put those on.
You're joking.

26:11.037 --> 26:13.070
How many fleas live
in that pile?

26:13.072 --> 26:14.738
That sock just moved.

26:14.740 --> 26:16.040
I can't get you out
of the castle

26:16.042 --> 26:17.975
unless you are disguised.
Bandages?

26:17.977 --> 26:19.944
Well. What,
I'm injured now as well?

26:19.946 --> 26:21.745
It's for your breasts.

26:23.015 --> 26:25.683
Oh.

26:25.685 --> 26:28.152
Pick up the pace, boy.

26:32.625 --> 26:34.091
This is
my standard bearer's son.

26:34.093 --> 26:35.292
His grandmother is on

26:35.294 --> 26:37.194
her deathbed just
outside the village.

26:43.102 --> 26:46.103
CATHERINE:
<i>I know we shouldn't be leaving.</i>

26:46.105 --> 26:48.339
To run is
an admission of guilt.

26:48.341 --> 26:50.975
To stay is
an acceptance of death.

26:50.977 --> 26:53.944
Here. There's enough
gold for three months.

26:53.946 --> 26:55.946
That's more
like one.

26:55.948 --> 26:58.282
You won't be
destitute forever.

26:58.284 --> 27:00.951
You just need to give me
enough time to clear your name.

27:00.953 --> 27:02.620
I don't know
if we'll meet again.

27:02.622 --> 27:04.188
I want to leave you
with one last piece of advice.

27:04.190 --> 27:07.324
And heed it or live a life
of unending peril.

27:07.326 --> 27:12.630
With Narcisse as regent, you no
longer have France behind you.

27:12.632 --> 27:14.064
And across the sea,
Elizabeth, well,

27:14.066 --> 27:16.033
she may have her troops
behind the border,

27:16.035 --> 27:18.869
but she will strike again
at any sign of weakness.

27:18.871 --> 27:21.205
Half of Scotland

27:21.207 --> 27:25.042
is Protestant, and more and more
convert every day.

27:25.044 --> 27:27.344
Your weakness only grows.

27:27.346 --> 27:30.347
I am well aware
of my own troubles.
There's

27:30.349 --> 27:31.782
but one solution.

27:31.784 --> 27:34.118
You must marry Don Carlos.

27:34.120 --> 27:36.186
No. I couldn't possibly.

27:36.188 --> 27:38.956
He's a decent man.
And a docile one now.

27:38.958 --> 27:41.959
There will be no more
sexual... contraptions.

27:41.961 --> 27:44.895
Well, there will probably be
no sex at all.

27:44.897 --> 27:49.099
That is a small sacrifice
for a colossal victory.

27:49.101 --> 27:52.102
Marriage to Spain
makes you unassailable.

27:52.104 --> 27:54.672
And mercenary.
Are you suggesting

27:54.674 --> 27:56.974
that I use his condition
for my own gain?

27:56.976 --> 27:58.742
For Scotland's.

27:58.744 --> 28:00.678
The heir
to the Spanish throne,

28:00.680 --> 28:02.146
he's like a nice
potted plant.

28:02.148 --> 28:04.148
Just take him back
to your country and water him.

28:04.150 --> 28:06.350
He is not a plant.
He is an injured man.

28:06.352 --> 28:08.118
And who would be kinder to him
than you?

28:08.120 --> 28:11.055
Certainly not the prideful
King Phillip.

28:11.057 --> 28:13.357
What do you think he will do
with his broken son?

28:13.359 --> 28:15.325
Lock him out of sight forever.

28:15.327 --> 28:18.462
In his state, Don Carlos has
no marriage prospects.

28:18.464 --> 28:20.998
Spain will see
your acceptance

28:21.000 --> 28:23.200
of his condition as a win.

28:23.202 --> 28:24.201
It's still wrong.

28:24.203 --> 28:27.037
Let him out here.

28:27.039 --> 28:29.206
His grandmother's house
is just beyond that glade.

28:29.208 --> 28:31.175
(horse neighs)

28:31.177 --> 28:34.178
This is as far as I can take
you, but it's a good head start.

28:34.180 --> 28:37.214
The Jouberts are a family loyal
to the Valois.

28:37.216 --> 28:39.283
They have offered you asylum
near Mont Blanc.

28:40.319 --> 28:42.252
Mary, please,

28:42.254 --> 28:44.788
don't waste
this golden opportunity.

28:44.790 --> 28:46.290
God be with you, Catherine.

28:48.394 --> 28:50.260
Dearest Mother,

28:50.262 --> 28:52.963
I received your letter
about Father and my brothers.

28:52.965 --> 28:56.233
I'm doing everything I can
to secure their release

28:56.235 --> 28:58.435
and am heartsick...

29:02.141 --> 29:03.173
Is there
an error?

29:03.175 --> 29:04.241
I'll start over.

29:13.319 --> 29:14.952
Cedric,
did you write this?

29:14.954 --> 29:16.787
"One rat down,
two to go"?

29:16.789 --> 29:18.188
No.

29:18.190 --> 29:19.490
I've never
seen...

29:19.492 --> 29:21.125
The penmanship
is the same.

29:21.127 --> 29:22.459
You are my husband's secretary.

29:22.461 --> 29:24.161
Did you write this
at his command?

29:24.163 --> 29:25.162
No, my lady.

29:25.164 --> 29:26.830
We court scribes
are all

29:26.832 --> 29:28.499
schooled in the
same calligraphy.

29:28.501 --> 29:30.467
Any one of us
could have written that.

29:30.469 --> 29:34.238
I suppose reliving Catherine's
threat at the inquest

29:34.240 --> 29:35.773
has made me a bit paranoid.

29:37.877 --> 29:40.444
Let's continue.

29:40.446 --> 29:42.346
(crickets chirping)

29:42.348 --> 29:44.248
(owl hoots)

29:45.151 --> 29:46.150
(horse neighs)

29:50.289 --> 29:52.356
Sebastian. How did you find me?

29:52.358 --> 29:54.892
Returning from Saint-Denis,
I came across Mary's carriage.

29:54.894 --> 29:57.528
She told me of
your planned route of escape.

29:57.530 --> 30:01.031
Did you find Francis' embalmer?
He's vanished.

30:01.033 --> 30:02.566
Neighbors say he came into a sum
of money

30:02.568 --> 30:04.401
and fled
the day after Francis' funeral.

30:04.403 --> 30:06.036
He was bribed.

30:06.038 --> 30:07.237
He handed off
Francis' liver

30:07.239 --> 30:08.539
to be tampered with

30:08.541 --> 30:10.240
by those who would frame me.

30:10.242 --> 30:11.475
I've been thinking about it,

30:11.477 --> 30:13.477
and I've come up
with a different view:

30:13.479 --> 30:16.246
that the blackened liver
didn't belong to Francis.

30:16.248 --> 30:18.382
This is the certificate
of immortalization

30:18.384 --> 30:19.917
signed by the embalmer.

30:19.919 --> 30:21.351
In it is the date
that he received

30:21.353 --> 30:23.587
Francis' body
and the date that Francis'

30:23.589 --> 30:25.889
prepared corpse
was sealed

30:25.891 --> 30:29.226
in his coffin at Saint-Denis,
a time span of just two days.

30:29.228 --> 30:31.495
A royal embalming takes a week.
Exactly.

30:31.497 --> 30:33.330
I believe these dates
were carelessly scribbled

30:33.332 --> 30:36.099
by a man so eager
to take his bribe and flee,

30:36.101 --> 30:37.568
he didn't bother embalming
Francis at all.

30:37.570 --> 30:39.503
If Francis' liver
is still in his body,

30:39.505 --> 30:41.271
it proves he wasn't poisoned.

30:41.273 --> 30:43.307
There's only

30:43.309 --> 30:44.975
one way to confirm that.

30:46.278 --> 30:48.979
(exhales)

30:49.915 --> 30:52.282
Let us visit my son.

30:52.284 --> 30:54.384
(crickets chirp, owl hoots)

30:54.386 --> 30:56.520
She recognized your handwriting?

30:56.522 --> 30:58.088
Yes, my lord.

30:58.090 --> 30:59.223
But I denied it.

30:59.225 --> 31:00.424
Did Lady Lola believe you?

31:01.894 --> 31:03.594
Wouldn't it
be simpler

31:03.596 --> 31:05.162
to just tell your wife
the truth?

31:05.164 --> 31:07.264
Nothing is simple anymore.

31:07.266 --> 31:09.533
What started
as an innocent scheme to catch

31:09.535 --> 31:11.635
a woman who didn't want
to be caught has blossomed

31:11.637 --> 31:14.171
into Lola giving false testimony
and a possible death sentence

31:14.173 --> 31:15.405
for the queen mother.

31:15.407 --> 31:16.506
But Catherine has fled.

31:16.508 --> 31:18.442
If she escapes
punishment,

31:18.444 --> 31:21.545
is this false testimony
such a crime?

31:21.547 --> 31:23.080
If the privy council discovered

31:23.082 --> 31:24.314
that I have misrepresented
evidence,

31:24.316 --> 31:26.049
then I will lose the regency!

31:26.051 --> 31:27.317
And I have fought
far too hard

31:27.319 --> 31:30.087
to have that power taken
from me.

31:31.924 --> 31:35.359
What is power without love?

31:35.361 --> 31:37.361
Without Lola?

31:37.363 --> 31:39.329
If she finds out
the truth,

31:39.331 --> 31:41.565
that I deceived her,
then she will never forgive me,

31:41.567 --> 31:43.533
and I will lose her.

31:43.535 --> 31:45.335
What are you going to do?

31:45.337 --> 31:47.004
Talk to her,

31:47.006 --> 31:50.540
spin one final lie
to cover my tracks,

31:50.542 --> 31:53.243
and then I will
honor her forever

31:53.245 --> 31:55.245
as an honest man.

31:55.247 --> 31:58.382
As for you, no one else
must ever be able

31:58.384 --> 32:01.418
to tie that miserable rat
back to me.

32:01.420 --> 32:03.086
(grunting)

32:03.088 --> 32:04.621
(yelling)

32:05.958 --> 32:08.959
(loud panting)

32:08.961 --> 32:10.994
(crickets chirping)

32:10.996 --> 32:13.497
(sighs)

32:14.433 --> 32:17.100
(panting)

32:18.270 --> 32:21.538
Please, God, let it end here.

32:28.480 --> 32:30.614
Stephan? I wanted to write
my mother another letter.

32:30.616 --> 32:33.483
Have you seen Cedric?
I've been looking for him.

32:33.485 --> 32:35.619
I let him go.

32:35.621 --> 32:38.488
He's often late, due to
his over-fondness for wine.

32:38.490 --> 32:40.390
Really? I've seen
no sign of that.

32:40.392 --> 32:42.326
It's been since
his father died.

32:42.328 --> 32:44.227
He's been
quite dispirited.

32:44.229 --> 32:46.463
Then we should
show him compassion.

32:46.465 --> 32:48.966
I want him rehired.
Well, that's not possible.

32:48.968 --> 32:52.135
Why not?

32:52.137 --> 32:55.339
I have an idea--

32:55.341 --> 32:56.707
an appalling one
I hope isn't true,

32:56.709 --> 32:59.009
but I must put it before you.

32:59.011 --> 33:01.712
Cedric told you
of my suspicions

33:01.714 --> 33:04.715
that you instructed him to draft
the note and plant the rat.

33:04.717 --> 33:09.086
His sudden disappearance is
your way of tying up loose ends.

33:09.088 --> 33:11.421
Did you bribe him to go away?

33:14.293 --> 33:15.525
(gasps)

33:15.527 --> 33:17.394
You killed him.

33:17.396 --> 33:19.262
No.
Please, let there be

33:19.264 --> 33:21.064
one honest thing between us.

33:21.066 --> 33:24.234
You want to hear
something honest?

33:25.571 --> 33:28.171
I love you,

33:28.173 --> 33:30.741
and I would do anything
to keep you.

33:30.743 --> 33:32.576
Oh, my God.

33:33.445 --> 33:34.711
You did it.

33:36.148 --> 33:37.714
And I'm leaving you.

33:37.716 --> 33:39.383
Lola, don't. You don't end this!

33:39.385 --> 33:41.451
I am going to England
at Queen Elizabeth's request,

33:41.453 --> 33:43.086
in exchange for the release

33:43.088 --> 33:44.421
of my family
and the other hostages.

33:44.423 --> 33:46.089
You can't.
It's not safe.

33:46.091 --> 33:47.791
Well, I don't feel
safe here, either.

33:47.793 --> 33:49.793
At least by doing this,
I can help

33:49.795 --> 33:51.495
my queen, my country, my family.

33:51.497 --> 33:53.463
People who mean something to me.

33:53.465 --> 33:55.632
You mean nothing.
I am your husband!

33:55.634 --> 33:58.201
And that can't be undone.

33:58.203 --> 34:01.605
But my love for you...
it's gone.

34:01.607 --> 34:03.740
You murdered that, too.

34:07.413 --> 34:09.513
(gasps, door closes)

34:09.515 --> 34:11.415
Your Majesty, lords
from the Southern Uplands

34:11.417 --> 34:14.184
have arrived
unexpectedly.

34:14.186 --> 34:16.553
They claim to have something to
show you, but won't say what.

34:16.555 --> 34:19.356
Scottish lords in French court?

34:19.358 --> 34:22.826
LORD CUNNINGHAM:
Your Majesty,
Lord Rutherford.

34:22.828 --> 34:24.661
MARY:
And what has

34:24.663 --> 34:27.431
brought you all this way?
We have been loyal
to your rule

34:27.433 --> 34:30.500
even after you withdrew the
troops protecting our borders.

34:30.502 --> 34:34.438
But your brother James can
only command so much power.

34:34.440 --> 34:38.141
What we need now is you,
our queen.<i> Your</i> power.

34:38.143 --> 34:39.609
(horse neighs)

34:39.611 --> 34:41.845
(horse sputters)

34:43.582 --> 34:46.316
(coughing)
They are starving.
Dear Lord.

34:46.318 --> 34:48.752
These children are victims
of the crop blight in Scotland.

34:48.754 --> 34:52.222
Hunger affords even
the innocent no mercy.

34:52.224 --> 34:54.524
Neither do you, forcing them
to make the arduous journey

34:54.526 --> 34:56.159
across the channel.

34:56.161 --> 34:57.794
We brought them
to prove our point.

34:57.796 --> 34:59.229
MARY:
They are children!

34:59.231 --> 35:02.265
Not points to be made. Guards!

35:02.267 --> 35:04.701
Have the royal physician
attend to them!

35:06.371 --> 35:09.473
If I sell my lands, my jewels?
It will provide

35:09.475 --> 35:12.142
Scotland with a few
weeks of grain at most.

35:12.144 --> 35:13.610
(coughing)
MARY:
That's a start.

35:13.612 --> 35:16.146
I need you to make a new list

35:16.148 --> 35:18.882
of potential marriage
alliances-- only<i> wealthy</i> royals.

35:18.884 --> 35:22.853
Reaching out to Europe's
eligible suitors will take time.

35:22.855 --> 35:24.521
Time we don't have.

35:24.523 --> 35:26.423
What is that?

35:26.425 --> 35:29.526
The ones who did not
make the journey.

35:29.528 --> 35:32.796
I must find a way
to save my people, and quickly.

35:37.903 --> 35:39.436
MAN:
Who goes there?

35:39.438 --> 35:40.504
(indistinct chatter)

35:40.506 --> 35:42.672
It's Catherine de Medici.

35:42.674 --> 35:44.608
(horse neighs)

35:44.610 --> 35:45.809
(horse sputters)

35:45.811 --> 35:47.577
NARCISSE:
Take the queen mother

35:47.579 --> 35:49.880
into custody.

35:51.583 --> 35:53.450
You didn't seriously think

35:53.452 --> 35:55.652
you could return here
and retain your freedom.

35:55.654 --> 35:57.254
I've returned
to<i> earn</i> my freedom.

35:57.256 --> 35:58.455
Unload the king.

35:58.457 --> 35:59.856
The king?

35:59.858 --> 36:02.592
I have endured many trials,

36:02.594 --> 36:05.662
but nothing as painful
as being forced to look upon

36:05.664 --> 36:08.632
the decaying corpse
of my firstborn son.

36:08.634 --> 36:10.634
Dear God, Catherine.
That is an image

36:10.636 --> 36:12.602
that I can't get out
of my mind, Stephan.

36:12.604 --> 36:15.805
And it was you who put it there.

36:15.807 --> 36:17.507
You gave me no choice.

36:17.509 --> 36:18.742
I'm innocent, and my son's

36:18.744 --> 36:21.344
body will prove it.

36:21.346 --> 36:22.746
Open the coffin.

36:22.748 --> 36:24.648
(horse sputters)

36:24.650 --> 36:27.517
Mary, avert your eyes.

36:28.787 --> 36:30.487
LOLA:
Mary, don't look.

36:30.489 --> 36:31.821
Please don't look.
(gasps)
Oh!

36:40.299 --> 36:42.365
The body has not been cut open.

36:42.367 --> 36:43.767
BASH:
His organs were
never removed.

36:43.769 --> 36:45.368
The liver used in
this witch hunt

36:45.370 --> 36:46.603
did not belong
to my brother.

36:46.605 --> 36:48.572
Francis wasn't poisoned
by me or anyone.

36:48.574 --> 36:50.307
I was framed.

36:50.309 --> 36:51.641
And you

36:51.643 --> 36:56.413
are responsible
for every bit of my suffering.

36:56.415 --> 36:58.882
I will reverse the
decision of the inquest.

36:58.884 --> 37:00.750
The Vatican also apologizes

37:00.752 --> 37:02.852
for our role
in this travesty of justice.

37:04.756 --> 37:06.256
Catherine.

37:06.258 --> 37:08.291
Catherine!

37:08.293 --> 37:10.827
Close it.

37:18.670 --> 37:20.403
(sniffling)

37:20.405 --> 37:22.939
What lies in that coffin
is only Francis' body.

37:22.941 --> 37:26.610
His soul and his
memory-- they live on.

37:26.612 --> 37:29.946
For Catherine to go
to such lengths...

37:29.948 --> 37:31.715
I can only hope this means

37:31.717 --> 37:33.950
we can put the whole
agonizing mess behind us.

37:35.787 --> 37:37.754
I would also like
to leave our disagreement

37:37.756 --> 37:39.689
behind us, as well.

37:39.691 --> 37:42.993
Mary, you were right
about Narcisse.

37:42.995 --> 37:47.697
He manipulated me, tricked
me into marrying him.

37:49.368 --> 37:51.835
I've decided to accept
Queen Elizabeth's invitation.

37:51.837 --> 37:53.370
Lola, no. It's too dangerous.

37:53.372 --> 37:54.904
You would be a hostage.

37:54.906 --> 37:57.907
I'm doing this for my family--
to ensure their release.

37:57.909 --> 37:59.676
A family that disowned you.

37:59.678 --> 38:01.378
Without Narcisse,
John and my people

38:01.380 --> 38:03.613
in Scotland are
all I have left.

38:03.615 --> 38:05.915
I know Charles will allow
my son to accompany me

38:05.917 --> 38:08.618
to the border town of
Selkirk, where my mother is.

38:08.620 --> 38:11.755
I'll leave the baby
there with her

38:11.757 --> 38:13.723
and appeal to
Queen Elizabeth's decency.

38:13.725 --> 38:16.359
Beg her to allow visits
with my son.

38:16.361 --> 38:18.662
Lola, this is all very noble,
and I know you feel

38:18.664 --> 38:20.730
like you must get away
from Narcisse, but...

38:20.732 --> 38:21.998
I feel like I have to.

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
Did you see him
in the courtyard?

38:24.002 --> 38:25.735
The look he gave Catherine?

38:25.737 --> 38:27.637
Something remains
between them,

38:27.639 --> 38:29.873
and even knowing
that, I...

38:29.875 --> 38:32.309
I worry he will win me back.

38:33.812 --> 38:35.845
Mary, please let me go.

38:37.916 --> 38:40.850
(sniffles)

38:40.852 --> 38:43.920
Elizabeth will do all
she can to mine you

38:43.922 --> 38:45.555
for information about me.

38:45.557 --> 38:47.791
And I will mine for my own
on your behalf.

38:47.793 --> 38:50.727
You're my dearest friend,

38:50.729 --> 38:53.697
and as of today,
the bravest person I know.
(chuckles)

38:53.699 --> 38:55.832
Only that I had some
of your courage

38:55.834 --> 38:57.033
in these times of uncertainty.

38:57.035 --> 38:59.602
Honestly, I'm terrified.

38:59.604 --> 39:01.905
But sometimes,
one does things

39:01.907 --> 39:04.074
one wouldn't normally do
for the people they love.

39:14.820 --> 39:17.554
To the crown prince
of Spain and his

39:17.556 --> 39:20.757
future bride, Her
Majesty Mary Stuart.

39:20.759 --> 39:23.126
Salud.
ALL:
Salud.

39:23.128 --> 39:24.127
Salud.

39:24.129 --> 39:26.696
Thank you, Duke, for embracing

39:26.698 --> 39:28.865
our engagement so quickly.
DUKE OF ALBA:
The impending union

39:28.867 --> 39:30.834
of our nations
is joyful news.

39:30.836 --> 39:33.603
King Philip sees you
as an ideal alliance.

39:33.605 --> 39:36.039
Pretty Mary.

39:36.041 --> 39:37.841
It must be difficult
for you to see

39:37.843 --> 39:41.511
my head still resting
so comfortably on my shoulders.

39:41.513 --> 39:42.746
I didn't frame you.

39:42.748 --> 39:44.748
You lied about the rat.

39:44.750 --> 39:46.483
'Cause I didn't want
to lose my wife.

39:47.686 --> 39:49.386
I lost her anyway.

39:49.388 --> 39:51.454
Oh.

39:51.456 --> 39:56.059
Despite everything we've done
to each other, I don't hate you.

39:56.061 --> 39:58.595
If I find out
that you were responsible

39:58.597 --> 40:01.798
for the conspiracy against me,
you will pay.

40:03.735 --> 40:05.402
¶ Want to travel... ¶

40:05.404 --> 40:06.903
Pretty Mary.

40:06.905 --> 40:09.906
Your Royal Highness, as
you know, it is customary

40:09.908 --> 40:11.908
to present your intended
with an engagement gift

40:11.910 --> 40:14.944
symbolizing Spain's intention
to honor our new alliance.

40:16.181 --> 40:18.882
A gift for Mary.

40:18.884 --> 40:22.952
¶ Carry me away
and save us from it all ¶

40:22.954 --> 40:28.091
¶ Break away... ¶

40:28.093 --> 40:31.428
Send... Scotland... grain.

40:31.430 --> 40:33.963
(cheering)

40:33.965 --> 40:37.801
¶ We're wonderful... ¶

40:37.803 --> 40:40.103
Grain is what you wanted?

40:40.105 --> 40:41.805
It's what I needed.

40:41.807 --> 40:45.809
Good grain. Hmm.

40:45.811 --> 40:48.812
Thank you. Now if you'll
please excuse me for a moment.

40:48.814 --> 40:50.613
Hmm.

40:50.615 --> 40:53.683
¶ We are the sun ¶

40:53.685 --> 40:57.053
¶ We'll rise above it ¶

40:57.055 --> 40:59.489
¶ We'll burn as one ¶

40:59.491 --> 41:05.562
¶ Burn as one... ¶

41:05.564 --> 41:08.064
(dog barking)

41:10.202 --> 41:14.737
¶ We're the hunters,
we're on the run... ¶

41:14.739 --> 41:16.706
You failed us, Cardinal.

41:16.708 --> 41:18.208
I did everything I could.

41:18.210 --> 41:20.543
Catherine must have located
the oil of vitriol

41:20.545 --> 41:22.045
that I planted
in her chambers.

41:22.047 --> 41:24.781
And Lord Narcisse had no choice
but to open the inquest

41:24.783 --> 41:27.016
after I presented him
with the poisoned liver.

41:27.018 --> 41:29.519
Once we learned of
the princess' diary, I...

41:29.521 --> 41:31.254
I thought the queen mother
was surely doomed.

41:31.256 --> 41:33.623
And yet, she walks free.

41:33.625 --> 41:35.258
None could foresee that

41:35.260 --> 41:39.229
she would dare to exhume
the king's body. Please.

41:39.231 --> 41:41.998
I can find another way to help
you bring down the Valois.

41:42.000 --> 41:45.034
I'll see that the group
considers your offer.

41:45.036 --> 41:47.070
In the meantime...

41:47.072 --> 41:51.107
(guttural groaning)

41:54.045 --> 41:56.613
Dump him in the river.

41:56.615 --> 41:58.681
