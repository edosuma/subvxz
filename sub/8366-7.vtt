KZFY P-p-p-p-p-Portland.

00:03.291 --> 00:05.925
And 97.2.
This is Fizzy.

00:05.927 --> 00:08.128
And this is Ziggy.
Welcome and good morning.

00:08.130 --> 00:09.863
Uh, just about the 6:00 hour.

00:09.865 --> 00:11.097
Wake up!

00:13.969 --> 00:16.035
When I woke up this morning,
my wife was looking at me.

00:16.036 --> 00:17.804
She's like--
she got that belly fat.

00:17.806 --> 00:19.005
Come on.

00:19.007 --> 00:20.507
She suddenly got
the belly fat.

00:20.509 --> 00:22.642
I-- you know,
I'm on Tinder now.

00:22.644 --> 00:24.778
- What?
- Yes, I'm giving it a try.

00:24.780 --> 00:26.146
Fizzy can't get a date.

00:26.148 --> 00:27.480
Guys, what's wrong with ya?

00:27.482 --> 00:29.649
You got a girl here.
She's looking great.

00:29.651 --> 00:32.051
Her hair's looking--
I'm talking blonde.

00:32.052 --> 00:34.554
And we need a cleanup on aisle
six, 'cause she is ready to go.

00:34.556 --> 00:36.289
I'm sorry. We're talking
about slip and slide.

00:36.291 --> 00:37.791
<i>Yeah, baby.</i>

00:37.793 --> 00:39.058
Let me tell you
something else too.

00:39.060 --> 00:40.560
We got a couple
of announcements.

00:40.562 --> 00:42.128
Louis CK coming up
at the Hollywood Theater.

00:42.130 --> 00:43.696
Louis, call me, by the way.
I'm single.

00:43.698 --> 00:45.165
I'm gonna say it.

00:45.167 --> 00:46.399
I'm okay with
a little light spanking.

00:48.003 --> 00:49.502
Fizzy, did you ever get
some of that butt makeup?

00:49.504 --> 00:51.738
Look, I'm a regular guy.

00:51.740 --> 00:53.573
I like rock and roll.
I like a hot dog and a beer.

00:53.575 --> 00:55.408
But it doesn't even
make sense.

00:55.410 --> 00:56.843
Guys, wouldn't you like it
if ladies put a little bit

00:56.845 --> 00:58.845
of just a blush
on some of them butts?

01:00.715 --> 01:02.515
So Louis CK
at the Hollywood Theater.

01:02.517 --> 01:05.318
17 years since my last drink.

01:05.319 --> 01:07.720
I wish I had one
every single day.

<i>So you guys know
I dropped out of high school</i>

01:30.278 --> 01:33.012
to focus on
my entrepreneurial endeavors.

01:33.014 --> 01:34.514
- Oh, yeah.
- Yep.

01:34.516 --> 01:36.216
We encouraged you.

01:36.218 --> 01:38.418
That's why your mom
won't speak to us anymore.

01:38.420 --> 01:39.686
Well, I have
an opportunity

01:39.688 --> 01:41.521
that only comes
once in a lifetime, yo.

01:41.523 --> 01:43.456
Once in a lifetime?

01:43.458 --> 01:45.091
I have seen the future.

01:45.093 --> 01:47.627
The future comes
as strawberry, blueberry,

01:47.629 --> 01:49.963
bubble gum, nilla, banilla.

01:49.965 --> 01:53.433
What am I talking about?
E-juice.

01:53.435 --> 01:54.968
both: Ooh.

01:54.970 --> 01:56.269
And how do you get
to this e-juice, you ask?

01:56.271 --> 01:58.538
You vape.
Smoking is out.

01:58.540 --> 02:00.473
Vaping is in.

02:00.475 --> 02:02.208
both: Oh.

02:02.210 --> 02:05.645
And there's over 45 million
analog smokers in the US,

02:05.647 --> 02:07.714
but only 2 1/2 million
e-smokers.

02:07.716 --> 02:09.549
That means this market
has a lot of room to grow.

02:09.550 --> 02:11.150
both: Ooh.

02:11.152 --> 02:14.754
In fact, e-cigarette sales
have doubled in the last year,

02:14.756 --> 02:18.458
going from this...

02:18.460 --> 02:19.726
to this.

02:19.728 --> 02:21.427
- Oh.
- Ooh.

02:21.429 --> 02:23.463
And all these new vapers,
they need a kick-it spot.

02:23.465 --> 02:25.064
They need a place to go,

02:25.066 --> 02:26.733
and that's where
you guys come in.

02:26.735 --> 02:28.601
I'd like you to be my partners
in opening up a vape shop.

02:28.603 --> 02:30.436
There's a space
currently available,

02:30.438 --> 02:32.405
and I think that if we don't
get in there and start vaping,

02:32.407 --> 02:33.907
somebody else will.

02:33.909 --> 02:35.475
What do you say?

02:35.477 --> 02:37.143
We could move
some assets around.

02:37.145 --> 02:39.846
Yeah, but, we could
lose our shirts on this.

02:39.848 --> 02:41.915
Yeah.

02:41.917 --> 02:45.118
- Oh.
- Or we could make a $1 million.

02:45.120 --> 02:47.287
Oh, okay.
Give it to him.

02:47.289 --> 02:52.258
How does an investment
of $800 sound?

02:52.260 --> 02:54.961
Does "Giddy up, new partner"
mean anything to you?

02:54.963 --> 02:57.263
All right.

02:57.265 --> 02:59.599
Okay, so what
are we gonna call this place?

02:59.601 --> 03:02.101
I was thinking
The Vaped Crusader.

03:02.103 --> 03:04.437
Ooh, what about,
Statutory Vape?

03:04.439 --> 03:05.505
Mm?

03:05.507 --> 03:07.273
Oh, come here, you.

03:09.711 --> 03:11.377
Go away.
Out.

03:12.547 --> 03:13.846
Cheap and Shitty
Storefront Design.

03:13.848 --> 03:14.847
How may I help you?

03:14.849 --> 03:16.616
Oh, that sounds very shitty.

03:16.618 --> 03:18.751
We'll be there later today.

03:18.753 --> 03:20.853
- What do we got?
- Another vape store.

03:20.855 --> 03:22.121
What?
It is seriously

03:22.123 --> 03:23.489
"Planet of the Vapes"
around here.

03:24.693 --> 03:27.493
<i>We tear all the wood out.</i>

03:27.495 --> 03:30.730
We want to get rid of anything
that seems natural, authentic.

03:30.732 --> 03:32.498
Get rid of everything here,
all those bags.

03:32.500 --> 03:34.233
Get rid of the espresso machine.
Get rid of that.

03:34.235 --> 03:36.169
- That all goes. That all goes.
- Anything rustic is gone.

03:36.171 --> 03:39.005
Anything authentic, anything
organic, anything permanent.

03:39.007 --> 03:40.573
The lighting is
too warm in here.

03:40.575 --> 03:42.075
This is too-- I'm feeling
too good about this.

03:42.077 --> 03:44.043
You know,
I want to see my own zits.

03:44.045 --> 03:46.212
Like a old thrift store
or something maybe.

03:46.214 --> 03:47.580
No, that's
even too descriptive.

03:47.582 --> 03:49.515
That's too kitschy.

03:49.517 --> 03:51.651
It should just be like part
of an airport that you ignore.

03:51.653 --> 03:53.386
Think of hanging out
inside a vending machine.

03:53.388 --> 03:54.821
- A cell phone store or a...
- Mm-hmm.

03:54.823 --> 03:56.389
Batteries Plus.

03:56.391 --> 03:57.657
That's kind of depressing,
though.

03:57.659 --> 03:58.925
Nope, nope.

03:58.927 --> 04:00.693
- Also, this is a vape store.
- Yeah.

04:00.695 --> 04:03.062
So we want a carpeting
that's going to absorb--

04:03.064 --> 04:04.330
and I don't mean mask--

04:04.332 --> 04:06.165
but literally
just absorb the odor

04:06.167 --> 04:09.068
so that when people come in
here, they're just overwhelmed.

04:09.070 --> 04:10.503
Okay, you want it
to be pungent.

04:10.505 --> 04:12.338
- Jaundice.
- You know, sickly, vomitus.

04:12.340 --> 04:13.706
- Just...
- The taste of bile.

04:13.708 --> 04:15.341
You want it to smell
like old bubble gum.

04:15.343 --> 04:16.843
Yeah, have you ever huffed
an Air Wick?

04:16.845 --> 04:18.543
No.

04:18.546 --> 04:19.911
Make sure your bathroom
really has got a toilet

04:19.914 --> 04:22.015
that's way too high
and kind of big.

04:22.017 --> 04:24.684
Also, two plungers.
Two plungers says it all.

04:24.686 --> 04:26.219
And, uh-- and, you're
gonna be working here?

04:26.221 --> 04:27.887
Yeah, I think so.

04:27.889 --> 04:29.589
I mean, I don't have a job,
but it's my shop.

04:29.591 --> 04:32.759
Hey, do you think
we'll get to meet Louis CK?

04:32.761 --> 04:35.028
- I hope so.
- His show is so funny.

04:35.030 --> 04:36.796
He performs in it;
he directs it.

04:36.798 --> 04:38.931
What most people don't know
is, he edits it.

04:38.933 --> 04:41.634
- I know that.
- Editing is the key to so much.

04:41.636 --> 04:43.302
I know what editing is.

04:43.304 --> 04:44.637
'Cause he used to do
a three-camera for HBO.

04:44.639 --> 04:46.606
- "Lucky Louie."
- Yes.

04:46.608 --> 04:48.441
You're starting to be a little
bit of a comedy nerd like me.

04:48.443 --> 04:50.209
But, like, "I Love Lucy," for
example, is a three-camera.

04:50.211 --> 04:51.444
That's one of the first ones.

04:51.446 --> 04:53.112
I've heard you
do this on dates.

04:53.114 --> 04:55.048
- Do not explain this stuff to me.
- Thank you. Thank you.

04:55.050 --> 04:56.916
- Oh, This is what editing is.
- Okay, well, you know.

04:56.918 --> 04:57.950
- Hey!
- I do.

04:57.952 --> 04:59.385
- Hi.
- What's up, you guys?

04:59.387 --> 05:02.321
If you guys are free tomorrow,
come to our grand opening.

05:02.323 --> 05:03.389
You guys
have a business?

05:03.391 --> 05:04.624
Yeah, we got
our own store now.

05:04.626 --> 05:05.925
- Yep.
- Oh, my gosh.

05:05.927 --> 05:08.327
Maybe you guys can judge
the plume contest.

05:08.329 --> 05:09.595
And was it it?

05:09.597 --> 05:10.963
They blow, like,
these beautiful...

05:10.965 --> 05:12.732
Smoke hearts

05:12.734 --> 05:14.634
and squares
with their mouths.

05:14.636 --> 05:15.935
- It's great.
- Me and Carrie'll do it.

05:15.937 --> 05:16.903
- When is it?
- Yeah!

05:16.905 --> 05:18.137
5:00 PM.

05:18.139 --> 05:19.806
5:00 PM.
We'll be there.

05:19.808 --> 05:21.674
- Don't flake out.
- I have not committed, but...

05:21.676 --> 05:23.076
- I'm committing both of us.
- Okay.

05:23.078 --> 05:24.343
- We're committing.
- Okay. Okay.

05:24.345 --> 05:25.611
Bye, guys.

05:25.613 --> 05:26.913
- What luck.
- All right.

05:26.915 --> 05:29.415
- A vape shop?
- Oh, "Vape My Day."

05:29.417 --> 05:31.451
I am not going to a vape shop.
Honestly, it just looks bad--

05:31.453 --> 05:32.852
Ladies
and gentlemen,

05:32.854 --> 05:34.687
unfortunately Louis CK
is not performing tonight

05:34.689 --> 05:36.322
due to a family emergency.

05:36.324 --> 05:37.790
We can't hear you back here.
What happened?

05:37.792 --> 05:39.425
There's been
a family emergency.

05:39.427 --> 05:40.827
Louis CK is not performing.

05:40.829 --> 05:42.361
Is the show canceled?

05:42.363 --> 05:44.297
No, it's been canceled,
absolutely.

05:44.299 --> 05:45.998
No, it's been-- is it
canceled or not canceled?

05:46.000 --> 05:47.667
It's been canceled.
It's been canceled.

05:47.669 --> 05:49.035
And what are the chances
the show will be, uh,

05:49.037 --> 05:50.970
back on for tomorrow night?

05:50.972 --> 05:53.139
I have no more details
at this time.

05:53.141 --> 05:54.841
How did you find out?

05:54.843 --> 05:56.676
I'm sorry. That's
the only details I can give you.

05:56.678 --> 05:59.045
- But who gave you the details?
- I am only the messenger.

05:59.047 --> 06:00.613
I know, but someone
gave you the message.

06:00.615 --> 06:03.116
- Okay, okay.
- Sorry, sir.

06:03.118 --> 06:04.684
All right.

06:04.686 --> 06:06.786
That's too bad.
You really are a big fan.

06:06.788 --> 06:08.321
Yeah, I'm a comedy guy.

06:11.517 --> 06:13.283
Oh, well.
We can always just try...

06:13.285 --> 06:14.518
- Kind of a drag, but...
- Yeah.

06:14.520 --> 06:16.453
Hey, Fred.
Hey, Carrie.

06:16.455 --> 06:17.654
What are you doing
with our toilet?

06:17.656 --> 06:19.689
Uh, yeah, it's busted.

06:19.691 --> 06:21.324
How do you know?

06:21.326 --> 06:23.427
I, you know, stopped by
to use your bathroom

06:23.429 --> 06:26.596
while I was doing my, you know,
regular landlord check-in.

06:26.598 --> 06:29.132
- Landlord check-in?
- Being responsible, yes.

06:29.134 --> 06:31.334
Is that something
that's even allowed?

06:31.336 --> 06:33.136
Landlord rights,
I'm sorry.

06:33.138 --> 06:35.272
Portland has some of the
strictest in the country.

06:35.274 --> 06:36.706
Let me ask you something.

06:36.708 --> 06:38.175
Are you flushing toilet paper
down the toilet?

06:38.177 --> 06:39.843
Yes, is that
a problem?

06:39.845 --> 06:41.278
That's-- well, yeah.

06:41.280 --> 06:42.612
I mean, you should really
go paperless.

06:42.614 --> 06:43.980
This is a very old house.

06:43.982 --> 06:45.882
1800s, it was built,
and the pipes--

06:45.884 --> 06:48.552
they're just not made
for the super poops of today.

06:48.554 --> 06:50.854
I mean, back then, everybody
ate flapjacks and radishes.

06:50.856 --> 06:52.322
Not like today where--
what do you eat?

06:52.324 --> 06:54.491
Like, quinoa and tofurt,
and that stuff?

06:54.493 --> 06:55.792
That's-- that's heavy.

06:55.794 --> 06:57.894
Uh, when are you
gonna fix it?

06:57.896 --> 06:59.996
Tomorrow afternoon,
probably.

06:59.998 --> 07:01.832
Well, what are we
supposed to do until then?

07:01.834 --> 07:02.966
I'm gonna do something
for you.

07:02.968 --> 07:04.167
- But you got to promise--
- Ah!

07:04.169 --> 07:05.168
Oh, oh, jeez,
I'm sorry.

07:05.170 --> 07:06.470
- Milton, this is...
- Ew.

07:06.472 --> 07:07.971
Can you just hold this
for a second?

07:07.973 --> 07:09.506
Disgusting,
and this is your house, okay?

07:09.508 --> 07:11.241
Yes, well, look.
I'm helping you out.

07:11.243 --> 07:12.843
This is my personal list

07:12.845 --> 07:14.678
of the coffee shops
in the neighborhood.

07:14.680 --> 07:16.980
And these are the bathroom codes
to every one.

07:16.982 --> 07:18.815
Well, it's very big of you
to give us your list.

07:18.817 --> 07:20.383
No problem.
I want that back, though.

07:20.385 --> 07:22.419
Well, this is kind of
turning out to be a crappy day.

07:22.421 --> 07:24.254
You know, it's, like,
Louis CK cancels,

07:24.256 --> 07:25.822
family emergency,
and now this.

07:25.824 --> 07:27.691
What's funny about it?

07:27.693 --> 07:29.259
What did you say?
"Family emergency"?

07:29.261 --> 07:30.727
Yeah, Louis CK
canceled a show.

07:30.729 --> 07:33.497
- He has a family emergency.
- Oh.

07:33.499 --> 07:35.065
- Oh, yeah.
- No, he doesn't.

07:35.067 --> 07:36.366
People just say that
to get out

07:36.368 --> 07:37.901
of stuff they want
to get out of.

07:37.903 --> 07:40.403
You don't cancel a whole show.
It seems serious.

07:40.405 --> 07:42.539
If you had to cancel
something big, right,

07:42.541 --> 07:45.041
and you just had to get out
of it, that's what you say.

07:45.043 --> 07:47.110
Then nobody will ask you,
"Oh, what happened?"

07:47.112 --> 07:48.578
They just go,
"Oh, oh, oh."

07:48.580 --> 07:50.280
- We'd like our toilet back.
- Yes.

07:50.282 --> 07:51.381
I would like
your toilet back too.

07:51.383 --> 07:52.415
- Okay.
- Can you get the door?

07:52.417 --> 07:53.683
Yes.

07:59.634 --> 08:01.734
I hope Milton
fixes our bathroom soon.

08:01.736 --> 08:02.801
What is going on?

08:02.803 --> 08:05.304
Um, behind you, 11:00.

08:05.306 --> 08:07.206
There's someone here
you might recognize.

08:07.208 --> 08:10.142
Oh, my God.

08:10.144 --> 08:11.443
- Is that Louis?
- That's Louis.

08:11.445 --> 08:13.078
That's so weird.

08:13.080 --> 08:14.880
It seems like he's
in no rush to get anywhere.

08:14.882 --> 08:16.115
Everything's
been great.

08:16.117 --> 08:17.716
He seems happy.

08:17.718 --> 08:18.984
I thought he had
a family emergency.

08:18.986 --> 08:20.419
I thought he was gonna go
out of town.

08:20.421 --> 08:21.720
I can't think
of any bad things recently.

08:21.722 --> 08:22.922
I'm gonna do
a quick picture.

08:22.924 --> 08:24.557
Okay.

08:27.495 --> 08:29.995
- That's hilarious.
- Excuse us.

08:29.997 --> 08:31.463
- Hi.
- Sorry to interrupt.

08:31.465 --> 08:33.499
- I'm-- I'm Carrie.
- I'm Fred.

08:33.501 --> 08:35.267
- Are you Louis?
- Yep, yeah.

08:35.269 --> 08:36.969
- We're huge fans.
- Thanks, guys.

08:36.971 --> 08:38.736
- Great to meet you.
- We're, like, comedy nerds.

08:38.739 --> 08:40.573
- We're, like, really into comedy.
- Hey, uh, Cindy.

08:40.575 --> 08:41.807
Can I call you back?

08:41.808 --> 08:42.975
No, you didn't
have to do that.

08:42.977 --> 08:44.343
Well, now I already--

08:44.345 --> 08:46.011
We didn't want
to interrupt anything.

08:46.013 --> 08:47.646
Yeah, we just wanted
to give you our condolences.

08:47.648 --> 08:49.648
We went to your show.
We paid for tickets.

08:49.650 --> 08:51.417
And then there was
a family emergency, so...

08:51.419 --> 08:53.986
You could just feel
the sense of sympathy.

08:53.988 --> 08:55.854
Thank you so much,
and I'm sorry about the show,

08:55.856 --> 08:58.657
but it was an unavoidable
family emergency.

08:58.659 --> 09:00.960
- How you doing, buddy?
- I'm fine, thank you.

09:00.962 --> 09:02.928
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah, everything's fine.

09:02.930 --> 09:05.364
Was it a hospital or a funeral
home that you had to go to?

09:05.366 --> 09:07.466
That's all I can say
at this time.

09:07.468 --> 09:09.501
If it's a family emergency,
why aren't you at the location?

09:09.503 --> 09:12.838
- Because I have to be here.
- You let us all down yesterday.

09:12.840 --> 09:15.608
- When you canceled your show.
- It's not me that let you down.

09:15.610 --> 09:17.309
Oh, so you're throwing your
family under the bus a little.

09:17.311 --> 09:19.345
They let us down.

09:19.347 --> 09:21.380
Well, they're the ones who
didn't look after the... baby.

09:21.382 --> 09:22.881
Ah, so there's a baby,

09:22.883 --> 09:23.949
and this is why
it's so embarrassing.

09:23.951 --> 09:26.652
It's-- is it your baby?

09:26.654 --> 09:28.954
Is this baby okay?
Is this baby alive?

09:28.956 --> 09:31.290
- Almost.
- You're baby's almost alive.

09:31.292 --> 09:32.958
- Yeah.
- Here's the thing.

09:32.960 --> 09:34.360
I think most people assumed
you wouldn't be here

09:34.362 --> 09:35.494
because you canceled a show.

09:35.496 --> 09:36.829
And here you are in Portland...

09:36.831 --> 09:38.130
- Yeah, okay.
- In a coffee shop--

09:38.132 --> 09:39.298
And most people
don't know that.

09:39.300 --> 09:40.633
You guys know it.
You just keep it--

09:40.635 --> 09:41.700
You don't have
to worry about it, right?

09:41.702 --> 09:43.002
Well, we took a picture.

09:43.004 --> 09:44.136
Fred took a picture
on his phone.

09:44.138 --> 09:45.638
Why'd you do that?

09:45.640 --> 09:47.740
That's all we can say
at this time.

09:47.742 --> 09:50.476
Okay, why don't you guys
have a seat?

09:50.478 --> 09:54.046
I think we all know that I
did not have a family emergency.

09:54.048 --> 09:55.347
I knew it.

09:55.349 --> 09:56.749
Yeah, we were starting
to suspect that.

09:56.751 --> 09:58.350
Yeah, okay, very good.

09:58.352 --> 10:02.187
The truth is, I was bidding
on a vintage camera on eBay,

10:02.189 --> 10:04.256
and the auction was gonna end
right during the show,

10:04.258 --> 10:05.524
so that's why I made up

10:05.526 --> 10:07.326
the family emergency thing,
so that--

10:07.328 --> 10:09.395
Couldn't a-- an assistant
have done that for you?

10:09.397 --> 10:11.096
It's that feeling, you know,
on eBay when you get the,

10:11.098 --> 10:12.898
"Eh, I got it, I got it,
I got it."

10:12.900 --> 10:14.767
I wanted to, like, live that.
That's a really big deal to me.

10:14.769 --> 10:16.535
Wow, you shouldn't be so
cavalier with your audience.

10:16.537 --> 10:18.103
To say a family emergency?

10:18.105 --> 10:19.738
Well, but the thing about
saying "family emergency" is

10:19.740 --> 10:21.106
that nobody asks questions,

10:21.108 --> 10:22.341
'cause it's like, "Uhh,"
you know?

10:22.343 --> 10:23.676
- Right.
- Did you get the camera?

10:23.678 --> 10:25.244
Yeah, and then the guy
who's selling it

10:25.246 --> 10:27.246
is right here in Portland,
so it's, like, perfect.

10:27.248 --> 10:28.747
It's a small town, Portland.

10:28.749 --> 10:30.416
And I'm not one of those
jerks who's like,

10:30.418 --> 10:32.384
"I'm gonna go online
and tell everybody."

10:32.386 --> 10:34.787
I can't lose the FFE thing,
the Fake Family Emergency thing.

10:34.789 --> 10:37.222
It's a big deal in my life.
I use it for a lot of things.

10:37.224 --> 10:38.424
Here's the thing.

10:38.426 --> 10:39.858
We just want to hang out
with you.

10:39.860 --> 10:41.727
If you promise
to have dinner with us,

10:41.729 --> 10:43.262
we will never tell anyone

10:43.264 --> 10:45.931
about your whole fake
family emergency thing.

10:45.933 --> 10:47.299
I got to be honest
with you guys.

10:47.301 --> 10:48.734
I really don't want
to hang out with you.

10:48.736 --> 10:50.369
It's gonna be kind of
like a chore for me,

10:50.371 --> 10:51.804
but I'm willing to do it
if you don't tell people

10:51.806 --> 10:53.372
about my fake family emergency,
which I depend on.

10:53.374 --> 10:55.107
- That's great.
- That's a deal.

10:55.109 --> 10:57.076
- Okay? Is that good? Okay.
- That's great, yeah.

10:57.078 --> 10:58.944
Uh, uh, everyone, hello?

10:58.946 --> 11:03.582
Uh, welcome to the grand opening
of Vape My Day.

11:03.584 --> 11:05.818
All right.

11:05.820 --> 11:09.621
Before we have some fun
sucking up these dope flavors...

11:11.125 --> 11:13.659
I just want to thank
my wife, Kristine,

11:13.661 --> 11:15.327
for making all this possible.

11:17.098 --> 11:21.800
And my nephew Andy for putting
this dream team together.

11:21.802 --> 11:24.103
All right.

11:24.105 --> 11:26.138
Okay, have some fun.

11:26.140 --> 11:30.309
Oh, uh, and don't forget to
sign up for the plume contest.

11:30.311 --> 11:31.677
- Gonna be great.
- Right.

11:34.348 --> 11:36.181
Okay, so let's go home,
get ready for dinner,

11:36.183 --> 11:38.183
and then, um, I guess
we'll just kind of

11:38.185 --> 11:39.451
blow off the vape thing,
right?

11:39.453 --> 11:40.652
Ebbe and Kristine?

11:40.654 --> 11:42.020
I don't know
if we can do that.

11:42.022 --> 11:43.822
You promised we'd judge
the plume contest.

11:43.824 --> 11:45.457
When is the next time
we're gonna have the opportunity

11:45.459 --> 11:46.925
to blackmail Louis CK
into dinner?

11:46.927 --> 11:48.927
We cannot tell them
that we got a better offer.

11:48.929 --> 11:50.262
I don't know
what we're gonna do.

11:50.264 --> 11:52.664
Me neither.

11:52.666 --> 11:54.767
I know what we can say.

11:56.170 --> 11:57.970
- Um, honey.
- What?

11:57.972 --> 12:00.139
Oh, Fred and Carrie
can't come.

12:00.141 --> 12:02.307
They had a family emergency.

12:02.309 --> 12:04.543
- Oh, that sounds serious.
- That sucks.

12:04.545 --> 12:06.211
They're probably
identifying a body

12:06.213 --> 12:08.113
or dental records right now.

12:08.115 --> 12:09.982
Or maybe they had
a car accident.

12:09.984 --> 12:12.151
Or they're at a ranch and
a horse bucked somebody off.

12:12.153 --> 12:13.652
Oh, my gosh.
All right.

12:13.654 --> 12:15.954
We got to take care of this.

12:15.956 --> 12:17.356
Excuse--
Hello, hello?

12:17.358 --> 12:18.824
Excuse me, everybody.

12:18.826 --> 12:23.362
Um, our dear friends,
Fred and Carrie,

12:23.364 --> 12:27.733
they were supposed to be here
tonight to judge our contest,

12:27.735 --> 12:29.668
but they cannot be here,

12:29.670 --> 12:31.470
due to a family emergency.

12:31.472 --> 12:33.906
I don't think I need to tell you
what that means.

12:33.908 --> 12:35.841
So in their honor,

12:35.843 --> 12:40.412

had a plume of silence.

15:54.995 --> 15:56.294
- That's one option.
- Right.

15:56.296 --> 15:58.496
That's great.

15:58.498 --> 16:00.131
- Oh, it just--
- That is great.

16:00.133 --> 16:01.933
both: Can we just talk
like human beings?

16:01.935 --> 16:03.468
Apparently you can't talk
like human beings.

16:03.470 --> 16:04.802
- Well, I'll tell you what.
- What?

16:04.804 --> 16:06.104
You want to talk real?

16:06.106 --> 16:08.072
Where are the piano teachers?

16:08.074 --> 16:09.440
What?

16:09.442 --> 16:10.909
Where are
the damn piano teachers?

16:10.911 --> 16:12.410
You know,
when you're a kid--

16:12.412 --> 16:13.811
Is this like trying
to be a comedy bit?

16:13.813 --> 16:15.613
- Yeah.
- Okay, go ahead.

16:15.615 --> 16:17.682
Let me hear the "where did
the piano teachers go" bit.

16:17.684 --> 16:19.651
Well, when you're a kid,
you got your baseball coach,

16:19.653 --> 16:21.419
you got your football,
and it's a piano teacher,

16:21.421 --> 16:23.421
you know,
damn pain in the neck.

16:23.423 --> 16:25.423
You got to go take
your piano lessons.

16:25.425 --> 16:27.625
- Where are the piano teachers?
- Here's the thing.

16:27.627 --> 16:29.661
The point of comedy is, you ask
a question that people go,

16:29.663 --> 16:31.262
"Yeah, I'm not sure
about that."

16:31.264 --> 16:33.164
- You know, I--
- You can't just ask a question.

16:33.166 --> 16:34.632
- No, I--
- How long--

16:34.634 --> 16:36.467
How long is a meter
compared to a yard?

16:36.469 --> 16:38.169
That's not a joke.

16:38.171 --> 16:39.671
But you can-- there's a way
you can perform it

16:39.673 --> 16:41.206
where it becomes funny.

16:41.208 --> 16:42.707
Let me see you
make that funny.

16:42.709 --> 16:45.443
All right, where are
the damn piano teachers?

16:45.445 --> 16:47.178
Look, guys,
I've had a long day,

16:47.180 --> 16:48.947
and I really would like to
just power through dinner, okay?

16:48.949 --> 16:51.749
Society's like that now.
We power through meals.

16:51.751 --> 16:53.885
We power through relationships.

16:53.887 --> 16:55.386
Also, where do people
get "powwow" from?

16:55.388 --> 16:57.522
I'm being serious.

16:57.524 --> 16:59.557
You know, it's like, "Do I
say 'moo-moo' or 'blah-blah'?"

16:59.559 --> 17:01.559
It's like these made-up words
that we somehow--

17:01.561 --> 17:03.995
Uh, okay, I got to pick up
that camera I won on eBay.

17:03.997 --> 17:05.296
Could you guys give me a--
give me a ride?

17:05.298 --> 17:06.698
both: - Yeah.
- That would be great.

17:06.700 --> 17:07.999
- Of course.
- Can we have the check, please?

17:08.001 --> 17:09.534
So soon?

17:09.536 --> 17:11.169
Yeah, let's hang out
for a little bit.

17:11.171 --> 17:12.869
- Yeah, no, let's go.
- We'll take you there.

17:12.872 --> 17:14.137
- No, let's go.
- No, let's wait for a second.

17:14.140 --> 17:16.540
I'm not done eating.

17:16.542 --> 17:18.242
The whole damn world
is in a rush.

17:18.244 --> 17:20.011
Where's everyone going?

17:20.012 --> 17:21.813
And also, what happened to
people looking at their watches?

17:21.815 --> 17:23.748
You're all looking
at your phones.

17:23.750 --> 17:26.416
It is just-- I'm serious.

17:26.419 --> 17:28.720
Now, what flavor
am I sucking on?

17:28.722 --> 17:30.888
- Ripe cherry.
- Ah.

17:30.890 --> 17:33.091
You ought to try the pesto.
That's my favorite.

17:33.093 --> 17:35.493
- Pesto.
- Try the rye bread.

17:35.495 --> 17:37.495
Rye bread?
I'm getting hungry.

17:37.497 --> 17:40.698
Yeah.

17:40.700 --> 17:42.367
Let me ask you
a question, though.

17:42.369 --> 17:44.402
How come you got seats reserved
for Fred and Carrie?

17:44.404 --> 17:45.837
- They were supposed to be here.
- Yeah.

17:45.839 --> 17:47.505
But they had
a family emergency.

17:47.507 --> 17:48.906
- Yeah.
- Huh.

17:48.908 --> 17:50.041
Yeah.

17:52.545 --> 17:54.445
Okay, yeah.
Oh, that's a good one.

17:54.447 --> 17:55.880
Hey, that's not funny.

17:55.882 --> 17:57.515
That's serious.

17:57.517 --> 17:59.450
They don't have
a family emergency.

17:59.452 --> 18:01.119
That's what you say if you want
to get out of something

18:01.121 --> 18:02.720
and you don't want
to explain yourself.

18:02.722 --> 18:04.522
Well, if they didn't
have a family emergency

18:04.524 --> 18:07.392
and they're not at our grand
opening, then where are they?

18:07.394 --> 18:09.127
<i>If murder was legal,</i>

18:09.129 --> 18:10.862
<i>I might've killed
a few people.</i>

18:10.864 --> 18:13.398
<i>I don't know.</i>

18:13.400 --> 18:14.732
You know, guys,
could you turn that off?

18:14.734 --> 18:16.301
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

18:16.303 --> 18:18.202
<i>- But we really need the law...</i>
- Ah, sure.

18:18.204 --> 18:19.404
<i>- Against murder.</i>
- Thank you.

18:19.406 --> 18:20.805
So do that joke again.

18:20.807 --> 18:24.575
What was the, um--
the one we just heard?

18:24.577 --> 18:25.910
I mean,
it's not something

18:25.912 --> 18:28.112
I can just turn on and do,
you know?

18:28.114 --> 18:31.249
It's like, what if I asked you,
like, sing, uh...

18:31.251 --> 18:33.584
you know, sing
the national anthem right now?

18:33.586 --> 18:35.653
- Okay.
both: - ♪ oh-oh, say ♪

18:35.655 --> 18:38.122
♪ can you see
by the dawn's ♪

18:38.124 --> 18:39.557
Do you want to hear
the whole thing?

18:39.559 --> 18:41.292
They're not having
a family emergency?

18:41.294 --> 18:43.628
No, no, I know for a fact.
I'm their landlord.

18:43.630 --> 18:46.164
They said nothing about coming
to the opening of a vape show.

18:46.166 --> 18:48.533
- You mean they blew us off?
- I'm sorry.

18:48.535 --> 18:51.269
- But they love massive plumes.
- Do they?

18:51.271 --> 18:52.503
- Here's a question.
- What?

18:52.505 --> 18:55.073
Anyone playing
tic-tac-toe anymore?

18:55.075 --> 18:57.108
- I'm serious.
- Hey, I need you to--

18:57.110 --> 18:58.976
I need you to make a left here,
okay?

18:58.978 --> 19:00.244
Hang a Louis?

19:02.649 --> 19:03.915
That's not funny.

19:07.296 --> 19:09.530
This is where you're
meeting the camera guy?

19:09.532 --> 19:10.998
Yeah, I guess he works
in his vape store.

19:11.000 --> 19:14.301
He's coming out in a minute.

19:14.303 --> 19:15.703
Hi.
Hey, how you doing?

19:15.705 --> 19:18.372
- Louis CK?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

19:18.374 --> 19:20.341
You bought my camera?

19:20.343 --> 19:21.875
I did, yep.
That's right, paid for it.

19:21.877 --> 19:23.510
- We should get out of here.
- Thank you.

19:23.512 --> 19:24.845
- All right, let's go.
- Let's roll out.

19:24.847 --> 19:26.180
All right, thank you.

19:26.182 --> 19:28.115
- Wow, Louis CK!
- Look! Look at him!

19:28.117 --> 19:29.516
- Hi, how are you?
- Oh, my God.

19:29.518 --> 19:30.851
- How are you? Hi.
- Bought your camera.

19:30.853 --> 19:32.219
- Fred and Carrie.
- Ah.

19:32.221 --> 19:33.854
- Hi.
- Oh, amazing you're here.

19:33.856 --> 19:35.956
- It is amazing.
- How is your family?

19:35.958 --> 19:37.992
Thank you for asking.
They're-- they're doing better.

19:37.994 --> 19:39.493
- Quite an emergency, I see.
- Yeah.

19:39.495 --> 19:40.861
- But how about that camera?
- Yeah, whoo.

19:40.863 --> 19:42.630
No, no, no.
Come on now.

19:42.632 --> 19:45.833
These two were supposed to judge
our plume contest tonight,

19:45.835 --> 19:47.668
but instead, they told us
they had a family emergency.

19:47.670 --> 19:48.802
- Yeah.
- So they lied to you.

19:48.804 --> 19:50.204
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

19:50.206 --> 19:51.472
They were actually
with you, I guess.

19:51.474 --> 19:52.740
- That's terrible.
- Yes.

19:52.742 --> 19:54.008
You guys,
that's really gross.

19:54.010 --> 19:55.409
I had no idea you were
such awful peop--

19:55.411 --> 19:56.844
what kind of person
would do a thing like that?

19:56.846 --> 19:58.312
I don't know.

19:58.314 --> 19:59.747
Louis, you want to come in
and do a set?

19:59.749 --> 20:00.914
We got a bunch of guys
with nothing to do.

20:00.916 --> 20:02.016
- Sure.
- No, no, no, no, no.

20:02.018 --> 20:03.717
- We have a crappy PA.
- Yeah.

20:03.719 --> 20:05.085
- You don't want to do that.
- Ah, I don't care.

20:05.087 --> 20:06.587
It's fine.
I'll do a set anywhere.

20:06.589 --> 20:08.222
- Really?
- I'll tell jokes to anybody.

20:08.224 --> 20:09.523
- Whee. Thank you so much.
- I'm so excited.

20:09.525 --> 20:12.026
- Oh, I love it.
- Oh, jeez.

20:12.028 --> 20:14.395
Um, we're full up in here,
you guys, sorry.

20:14.397 --> 20:16.063
There's room right in there.
We can go in.

20:16.065 --> 20:17.598
No, no, no, no, no,
we're at capacity.

20:17.600 --> 20:19.099
It's just us, though.

20:19.101 --> 20:21.201
That's all we can say
at this time.

20:21.203 --> 20:22.436
Okay.

20:22.438 --> 20:23.671
- Great, thanks.
- All right, well...

20:26.008 --> 20:27.608
I guess we can watch
through the window.

20:27.610 --> 20:30.744
- Oh, yeah.
- Hey, Fred. Hey, Carrie.

20:30.746 --> 20:32.179
- Hey.
- Hi, Milton.

20:32.181 --> 20:33.547
Hey, look. I got your toilet.

20:33.549 --> 20:35.215
You can put it in tonight.

20:35.217 --> 20:37.251
No, its gonna take me
a few more days at least,

20:37.253 --> 20:40.120
but I have some new bathroom
codes for, you know,

20:40.122 --> 20:43.023
the local 7-Elevens,
gas stations, Laundromats.

20:43.025 --> 20:45.859
This is a downgrade.
Some of those aren't even clean.

20:45.861 --> 20:47.094
I'm sorry.

20:47.096 --> 20:48.595
Hey, I got
to get back inside.

20:48.597 --> 20:50.964
Louis CK's about to perform.

20:50.966 --> 20:52.733
And also,
I was at a restaurant,

20:52.735 --> 20:54.601
and I was thinking, you know,
don't you hate waiters?

20:54.603 --> 20:57.137
I just hate waiters.

20:57.139 --> 20:58.472
It's like,
what are you giving me?

20:58.474 --> 21:00.074
You're bringing me my food?

21:00.076 --> 21:02.142
Don't take my order.

21:02.144 --> 21:03.744
I'll take my order.

21:04.747 --> 21:06.080
And what's up with--

21:06.082 --> 21:08.382
There used to be
so many piano teachers.

21:08.384 --> 21:09.917
Right?

21:09.919 --> 21:11.652
- It's true! It's true, yeah!
- Right?

21:11.654 --> 21:15.298
I mean, it used to be like,
"Piano teacher, what's up?".

21:15.299 --> 21:16.606
Now it's like--

21:16.607 --> 21:18.985
Where are all the
piano teachers?

21:18.986 --> 21:21.165
I mean, it blows my mind.

21:21.166 --> 21:23.015
They're gone.

21:23.016 --> 21:24.865
I'm serious.
