it couldn't be better to you

[GRUNTING]

11:05.239 --> 11:06.874
[KNOCKING]

11:08.002 --> 11:09.142
Mary Charles.

11:09.153 --> 11:10.920
M-CHUCK: Hey, Pookie, what's going on?

11:10.931 --> 11:13.537
What's going on?
It's 9:00 and you're in Boston.

11:13.547 --> 11:15.740
Yeah. Guess I should have called first,

11:15.750 --> 11:17.775
sent a text or something.

11:17.785 --> 11:19.509
Hey listen, quick question.

11:19.519 --> 11:21.014
You know anything about what happened

11:21.025 --> 11:23.227
to my mother that night on Long Island?

11:24.491 --> 11:26.160
It looks wet out there. Come in.

11:27.143 --> 11:30.059
You're right, I wasn't thinking.
I should have called or something first.

11:30.070 --> 11:31.713
I'm sorry about that.

11:33.058 --> 11:35.664
I really need you to tell me the truth.

11:35.675 --> 11:38.532
- Not sure what you're talking about.
- See, you can't pause like,

11:38.543 --> 11:40.863
"Oh, shit," and then be all "Not
sure what you're talking about,"

11:40.874 --> 11:42.199
'cause when you paused your
face sorta said, "Oh shit,"

11:42.209 --> 11:44.201
like you did know what
I was talking about.

11:44.211 --> 11:46.336
You didn't scrunch up
your face confused,

11:46.346 --> 11:48.005
so cut the bullshit.

11:48.015 --> 11:49.840
Ma told Cam my existence on Earth

11:49.850 --> 11:52.342
started with a sexual
assault on Long Island.

11:52.352 --> 11:54.811
What do you know about that?

11:54.822 --> 11:57.014
For what it's worth,
you've yet to offer me a beverage.

11:57.024 --> 12:00.084
I got water, coffee, Diet Dr. Pepper.

12:00.094 --> 12:02.429
Is the coffee made, or is it
gonna be like a whole process?

12:03.798 --> 12:06.166
Diet Dr. Pepper, please.

12:10.871 --> 12:12.807
Is what Ma said true?

12:18.478 --> 12:19.598
You wearing a wire?

12:19.609 --> 12:21.104
If you're worried I'm wearing a wire,

12:21.115 --> 12:22.324
some shit really went down.

12:22.335 --> 12:23.504
I didn't say that.

12:23.515 --> 12:26.255
So what is it, some opportunistic
ploy to get me to show you my tits?

12:26.266 --> 12:27.576
For God's sakes, Mary Charles!

12:27.587 --> 12:30.380
It's fine. You tell me who raped
my mother, I'll show you my tits.

12:30.390 --> 12:32.516
- I don't want to see your tits!
- I got great tits.

12:32.526 --> 12:33.851
You're my dead friend's niece.

12:33.861 --> 12:35.385
All grown up with a great rack.

12:35.395 --> 12:36.520
Anyway, you like girls.

12:36.530 --> 12:38.022
My titties don't know that.

12:38.032 --> 12:40.024
In a vacuum, titties
ain't straight or gay.

12:40.034 --> 12:42.526
Mine are perfect. You'd be
grateful to see how perfect.

12:42.536 --> 12:43.928
I can see titties whenever I want.

12:43.938 --> 12:45.462
- Bullshit.
- I can.

12:45.472 --> 12:46.831
Bullshit.

12:46.841 --> 12:48.833
Right now, if I want to see some titties

12:48.843 --> 12:50.968
I can walk next door,
tell Yolanda I'm good to go

12:50.978 --> 12:53.881
and I'd have a face full
of titties in six seconds.

12:54.701 --> 12:56.765
So she's just sitting over
there on titty standby?

12:56.776 --> 12:58.275
Amongst other things she's juggling.

12:58.285 --> 13:00.845
She's a bookkeeper.
She's active on black Twitter

13:00.855 --> 13:02.412
and volunteers at church.

13:02.422 --> 13:04.648
My titties are better.

13:04.658 --> 13:06.593
Titties are in the eyes of the beholder.

13:06.793 --> 13:07.952
And no disrespect,

13:07.962 --> 13:09.519
there's no use in me looking at titties

13:09.529 --> 13:12.022
that I ain't gonna do nothing with.

13:12.032 --> 13:15.816
Pook, my conception is a dark
hood mystery with few facts.

13:15.827 --> 13:17.785
The one clue I got is
that my ma told Cam

13:17.796 --> 13:19.453
that some friends drove
her to Long Island

13:19.464 --> 13:22.399
and what I know is that you were the
one with the car back in the day.

13:22.409 --> 13:24.602
I know you and Julius
and my ma and my aunt

13:24.613 --> 13:27.071
partied when you were younger,
so if my mother was in a car

13:27.081 --> 13:28.939
driving to Long Island from Boston,

13:28.949 --> 13:30.875
the likelihood that you
were driving that car

13:30.885 --> 13:32.715
that took her to that
first party is high.

13:32.726 --> 13:34.845
But since my uncle is dead
and my mother is in China

13:34.855 --> 13:37.915
I am sitting here
seeking answers from you

13:37.925 --> 13:40.149
on who impregnated my
mother against her will.

13:40.160 --> 13:42.019
And even though that
pregnancy resulted in me

13:42.029 --> 13:43.820
I am gonna find them and I am gonna go

13:43.830 --> 13:45.089
full fucking Munich on them,

13:45.099 --> 13:46.957
but I need to know where to start.

13:46.967 --> 13:49.093
Munich. You talking about
the Spielberg movie

13:49.103 --> 13:50.757
where the dudes chase
down the other dudes

13:50.768 --> 13:53.007
- that killed the Israeli Olympians?
- Yes.

13:53.440 --> 13:54.975
Violent flick.

14:00.514 --> 14:02.272
Call your ma.

14:02.282 --> 14:05.209
- For what?
- I don't know. Ask her.

14:05.219 --> 14:08.312
Ma's in Shanghai, and she told
me never to bring this up again.

14:08.322 --> 14:10.991
So why aren't you listening to her?

14:12.692 --> 14:15.852
CAMILLE: Missy, you can't be taping
old photos on punching bags.

14:15.862 --> 14:18.222
You're gonna make a difficult
situation more difficult,

14:18.232 --> 14:20.390
and you're gonna make
your husband difficult.

14:21.620 --> 14:23.066
[STAMMERING] I'm just saying.

14:23.077 --> 14:24.929
MISSY: It's not that
Reggie is difficult.

14:24.939 --> 14:27.397
It's just that life can be.

14:27.407 --> 14:29.099
One's past can be,

14:29.109 --> 14:30.400
and more for him than me.

14:30.410 --> 14:32.369
Well, the burden is on each individual

14:32.379 --> 14:35.705
to lead a worthy life
regardless of pedigree.

14:35.715 --> 14:37.507
Please go to another room.

14:37.517 --> 14:39.343
I know Reggie hurts,

14:39.353 --> 14:41.345
but what's difficult

14:41.355 --> 14:43.280
is that he won't let me in to help.

14:43.290 --> 14:46.083
He tells me I don't understand,
because I got great parents.

14:46.093 --> 14:48.552
CAMILLE: Now, I agree.
You've got great parents.

14:48.562 --> 14:52.656
But... this is what happens when the
genesis of a marriage is rebellion.

14:52.666 --> 14:54.724
Love was the genesis.

14:54.734 --> 14:57.294
Pursuing what one believes is love

14:57.304 --> 15:00.097
despite one's instincts is rebellion.

15:00.107 --> 15:02.732
My instincts are spotless.

Opposites attract, but they also repel.

of the House in six hours.

15:08.515 --> 15:11.041
Mom, I married Reggie
because I love him,

15:11.051 --> 15:13.177
not because he wasn't the kind of man

15:13.187 --> 15:14.912
you expected me to marry.

15:14.923 --> 15:16.706
Being in love and having
incredibly bad ideas

15:16.717 --> 15:18.649
are not mutually exclusive...

- CAMILLE: but the following is indisputable.

15:20.627 --> 15:23.187
Any woman who thinks she
possesses the antidote

15:23.197 --> 15:25.722
to fix a man who was
essentially constructed

15:25.732 --> 15:27.791
in an abusive and rotten environment

15:27.801 --> 15:30.060

just a little too much.

And don't give me that look like a
man can't be right about such things,

Take me off speaker.

18:10.197 --> 18:12.088
Okay, done.

18:13.934 --> 18:16.226
that I was gonna talk about

to me about the thing,

18:20.774 --> 18:22.599
I confirmed that it was true,

18:22.609 --> 18:24.401
and then I told you that I did not want

18:24.411 --> 18:26.436
to talk about the thing anymore.

Sometimes I think that when life
forces you to confront your past,

19:09.523 --> 19:11.581
there can be joy and
discovery in the knowing,

Listen, if it's the last
useful thing I ever say,

21:08.455 --> 21:12.815
please let me call you
an Uber or a taxi,

21:12.825 --> 21:15.462
but don't drive this car in
the condition you're in.

21:21.200 --> 21:23.069
You lying about being off the booze?

21:23.303 --> 21:24.737
Five years.

21:35.415 --> 21:37.907
My love, rise and shine.

21:37.917 --> 21:41.210
Mother had the servants
make some American coffee.

21:41.220 --> 21:44.414
Aw, Mama Chen. She's so thoughtful.

21:44.424 --> 21:46.316
Mother and Father are out.

21:46.326 --> 21:47.984
Let's retire to my teenage bedroom.

21:47.994 --> 21:51.298
I've never had sex in there
with anyone else but myself.

21:52.365 --> 21:53.723
[PHONE RINGING]

21:53.733 --> 21:55.258
Ooh!

21:55.268 --> 21:57.727
My son! My shining light.

21:57.737 --> 21:59.729
Hey, Ma.

21:59.739 --> 22:01.240
Ma...

22:01.974 --> 22:03.966
I just saw Rodney.

22:03.976 --> 22:05.535
Rodney who?

22:05.545 --> 22:08.106
Rodney Barker. I'm in Boston.

22:08.848 --> 22:09.896
Oh.

22:11.951 --> 22:13.543
Oh, with your sister?

22:13.553 --> 22:17.514
- She's in Boston.
- What's M-Chuck doing in Boston?

22:17.524 --> 22:19.258
Putting me in a bad mood.

22:20.527 --> 22:22.485
Chen, can you excuse
me for a minute, baby?

22:22.495 --> 22:24.531
I'm gonna go shower. Meet me.

22:25.598 --> 22:27.824
Oh, don't eat the white spongy stuff.

22:27.834 --> 22:29.492
Stick to the duck.

22:29.502 --> 22:31.538
The duck is the stuff
that looks like ham.

22:32.271 --> 22:33.540
Okay.

22:35.475 --> 22:37.400
What's up with you two mopey kids

22:37.410 --> 22:40.403
placing so much importance
on who got me pregnant?

22:40.413 --> 22:43.373
Well, in M-Chuck's case, she still
doesn't know exactly who that is.

22:43.383 --> 22:46.543
- CASSIE: Exactly don't matter.
- My case, Rodney's half of me.

22:46.553 --> 22:48.978
Oh, no, no, no. Hell, no.

22:48.988 --> 22:50.780
He ain't fucking half of you.

22:50.790 --> 22:53.783
If he had half your ass
growing inside of his belly,

22:53.793 --> 22:56.386
then he pushed you through
the tip of his dick,

22:56.396 --> 22:58.087
then maybe I would give
him half the credit

22:58.097 --> 22:59.288
for having half of you.

22:59.298 --> 23:01.233
But no, the mother has the egg.

23:01.434 --> 23:02.555
Learn your science.

23:02.566 --> 23:03.793
I know science, Ma.

23:03.803 --> 23:06.396
Well, then you would know
that I hatched the egg

23:06.406 --> 23:08.431
that turned into you, okay?

23:08.441 --> 23:10.633
You came from my egg. Mine!

23:10.643 --> 23:13.503
The shell, the white part,
the yolk, mine.

23:13.513 --> 23:16.573
That convict's contribution
was nothing more

23:16.583 --> 23:19.008
than the paprika shit they
sprinkle on deviled eggs.

23:19.018 --> 23:21.511
Don't be making that
motherfucker into the yolk.

23:21.521 --> 23:23.546
Ma, that ain't how DNA works.

23:23.556 --> 23:25.348
Half the genetic
material comes from you,

23:25.358 --> 23:26.950
and then the other half comes from him.

23:26.961 --> 23:28.418
Read the Internet.

23:28.428 --> 23:30.820
I still got your DNA floating
around inside of me.

23:30.830 --> 23:33.590
Rodney doesn't even have
the powdered prison eggs

23:33.600 --> 23:35.892
that he ate this morning in his ass.

23:35.902 --> 23:37.894
Shit!

23:37.904 --> 23:39.639
Oh, man, you kids!

23:41.007 --> 23:43.533
Look, [STAMMERING] you
got all this money now,

23:43.543 --> 23:47.136
and you're distracted with
this trivial bullshit!

23:47.146 --> 23:48.605
- [MURMURING]
- Trivial.

23:48.615 --> 23:51.708
So how was your visit
with your dear old Pops?

23:51.718 --> 23:54.076
He said he wrote me
letters when I was 11.

23:54.086 --> 23:55.378
Did he?

23:55.388 --> 23:56.813
He may have. I can't recall.

23:56.823 --> 23:59.382
I was too busy raising
you and your sister

23:59.392 --> 24:00.683
to be the overly-inquisitive

24:00.693 --> 24:03.219
nosy-ass little shits you turned into.

24:03.229 --> 24:05.455
Okay, so he wasn't a total deadbeat.

24:05.465 --> 24:08.525
Oh, God, he's a convict.

24:08.535 --> 24:10.760
Stop trying to make him into
something that he's not

24:10.770 --> 24:14.541
just because you're sad that
you lost in the playoffs!

24:15.616 --> 24:18.167
Look, baby, he was a boy

24:18.177 --> 24:20.470
that I met at a fair.

24:20.480 --> 24:23.172
And that I had sex with nine times,

24:23.182 --> 24:24.674
many, many summers ago.

24:24.684 --> 24:27.376
You want to have a chit-chat
with him? Go ahead.

24:27.386 --> 24:29.211
Have at it. Pen-pal it out.

24:29.221 --> 24:31.581
Matter of fact, why don't you
go put some money on his books

24:31.591 --> 24:33.683
or maybe toss a ball in
the prison play yard.

24:33.693 --> 24:36.453
But don't you dare call me here

24:36.463 --> 24:38.455
all the way in China trying to blame me

24:38.465 --> 24:40.449
for some shit that I did
many, many years ago

24:40.460 --> 24:43.470
when all I was trying to do
was make shitty ends meet.

24:44.771 --> 24:48.097
You know what,
if you are done judging me,

24:48.107 --> 24:50.900
I'm gonna go take the new
vagina that you bought me,

24:50.910 --> 24:53.345
and I'm gonna go have sex
with my billionaire boyfriend

24:53.546 --> 24:55.448
in his teenage bedroom.

25:00.553 --> 25:02.545
There were three of them.

25:02.555 --> 25:05.948
Two brothers and their cousin.

25:05.958 --> 25:07.860
15, 16 years old.

25:09.662 --> 25:12.298
Your uncle went to find
her the next morning,

25:12.499 --> 25:15.592
he found her walking.

25:15.602 --> 25:18.928
She had a lot of bruises,

25:18.938 --> 25:20.863
and a lot of scrapes.

25:20.873 --> 25:23.576
She had rope burns on her wrists.

25:24.811 --> 25:27.313
What the fuck? How did
they get away with it?

25:27.547 --> 25:28.848
They didn't.

25:53.472 --> 25:56.676
[PHONE BUZZING]

26:02.244 --> 26:03.283
Hey, Ma.

26:04.712 --> 26:06.534
He did write you.

26:07.153 --> 26:09.245
What?

26:09.255 --> 26:11.614
CASSIE: He did write you.

26:11.624 --> 26:13.366
Why didn't you ever tell me?

26:13.377 --> 26:14.669
Because you were the type of kid

26:14.680 --> 26:16.653
who would commit a crime
if you thought it would

26:16.663 --> 26:18.187
allow you to live with him in prison.

26:18.197 --> 26:19.556
Did you save any of them?

26:19.566 --> 26:20.646
CASSIE: For a time.

26:20.657 --> 26:22.291
At the apartment on Washington and Reed.

26:22.301 --> 26:24.093
You don't remember us getting evicted?

26:24.103 --> 26:26.829
Who moved in there? Like, why wouldn't
they have forwarded the mail?

26:26.839 --> 26:30.066
Would you stop applying rich
man logic to the ghetto?

26:30.076 --> 26:32.268
I mean, have you forgotten
about where we come from?

26:32.278 --> 26:35.137
We got evicted in the middle
of a fucking blizzard.

26:35.147 --> 26:39.542
I'm sorry, baby. I mean,
he did write you, for a time.

26:39.552 --> 26:42.211
You were 12, but almost
nothing up until then.

26:42.221 --> 26:44.513
But you never told me he did.

26:44.523 --> 26:46.315
Cam, I wasn't who I am now.

26:46.325 --> 26:48.317
You weren't who you now are,

26:48.327 --> 26:50.653
and he is... He's where he is.

26:50.663 --> 26:52.789
And that's all I can say, baby.

26:52.799 --> 26:55.725
That, and that I-I'm sorry
that you're hurting.

26:55.736 --> 26:57.261
I'm sorry if you feel

26:57.272 --> 26:59.143
that this is part of the
reason why you're hurting.

26:59.154 --> 27:01.297
I'm sorry for not being

27:03.542 --> 27:05.301
or who can't remember to grab the shit

27:05.311 --> 27:06.803
that she was hiding from you

27:06.813 --> 27:09.682
because she got evicted during
a motherfucking blizzard.

27:11.951 --> 27:16.679
And there weren't that many,
like 10 or 20 or something.

27:16.689 --> 27:19.616
Look, you are a man now.
I can't tell you

27:19.626 --> 27:21.684
what you should and shouldn't be doing,

27:21.694 --> 27:24.153
or who you should or
shouldn't be visiting.

27:24.163 --> 27:25.755
But I raised you, son.

27:25.765 --> 27:28.591
And it wasn't easy. I know, Ma.

27:28.601 --> 27:31.694
CASSIE: Well, it's good to be
reminded, even for a famous man.

27:31.704 --> 27:33.796
I raised you.

27:33.806 --> 27:35.564
I made sacrifices.

Your grandmother helped
me before she died.

27:40.713 --> 27:42.705
My brother helped me before he died.

27:42.715 --> 27:46.308
That's how hard a job
it is raising a kid.

27:46.318 --> 27:47.810
People die from doing it!

27:47.820 --> 27:50.847
- So don't forget them.
- I won't. I don't.

27:50.857 --> 27:53.215
CASSIE: Good. Go visit
your grandmother's grave.

27:53.225 --> 27:54.784
Go visit your aunt's grave.

27:54.794 --> 27:56.285

They are the ones who did a bunch,

27:58.130 --> 28:00.122
not Rodney.

28:00.132 --> 28:04.360
The only shit he did was the shit
that put him where he is now.

28:04.370 --> 28:05.795
Don't stay up there for long.

28:05.805 --> 28:08.397
We've been all good
since we left Boston.

28:08.407 --> 28:10.733
Boston is in the past.

28:10.743 --> 28:13.612
Don't bring your past
into your right now.

28:14.213 --> 28:15.604
Okay, baby?

28:15.614 --> 28:17.740
- Yep.
- CASSIE: I love you. Be good.

28:17.750 --> 28:19.171
And when you get back to Atlanta,

28:19.182 --> 28:21.409
you and your sister need to
cut it with the curiosity

'cause that shit kills more than cats.

of us don't get gang raped.

We won't get there till 2:00,
3:00 in the morning.

28:43.309 --> 28:46.402
Pook, I waited my entire
life for some closure.
