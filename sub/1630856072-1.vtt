03:15.905 --> 03:17.948
It's gotta be fate,
so how about a date?

- [Operator] Voice
activation request.

03:47.227 --> 03:48.103
- Ryan.

03:48.187 --> 03:49.104
- [Operator] Confirmed.

03:49.188 --> 03:50.773
Connecting you now.

03:50.856 --> 03:52.191
- [Man] Ryan, hello.

03:52.274 --> 03:54.193
This is Peter Ward
for mission briefing.

03:54.526 --> 03:56.070
- I usually work with DeGarza.

03:57.404 --> 03:59.031
- You like to swim,
I love swimming.

03:59.114 --> 04:01.283
Yeah, swimming with beautiful
women, that's the saying.

04:04.286 --> 04:05.287
No.

04:06.747 --> 04:07.790
- Do you have a tab?

04:07.873 --> 04:10.709
- No, I've been using
your man's tab all night.

04:11.126 --> 04:12.461
- [Peter] For now,
I am handling

04:12.544 --> 04:14.505
all of DeGarza's
client accounts.

04:14.588 --> 04:16.006
How is St. Martin?

04:16.256 --> 04:18.717
- St. Martin is great.
My team deserves it.

04:19.051 --> 04:21.428
- [Peter] Yes, I heard
about Venezuela.

04:21.720 --> 04:23.013
You guys did a good job.

04:23.681 --> 04:24.932
- We were hoping
to stay for a while,

04:25.015 --> 04:26.934
but I'm guessing this
isn't a courtesy call.

04:27.017 --> 04:29.269
- You know, I was working on
that girl for like 30 minutes.

04:29.353 --> 04:30.354
- I saved her.

04:30.437 --> 04:32.314
- Yeah, you saved
her from a good time.

04:32.439 --> 04:35.192
- [Peter] A VIP client activated
their emergency GPS beacon.

04:35.275 --> 04:36.777
You are the closest
extraction team.

04:36.860 --> 04:38.278
- Any other communications?

04:38.362 --> 04:39.321
- [Peter] Negative.

04:39.405 --> 04:41.532
Total communication
blackout on the island.

04:41.615 --> 04:43.200
Only the GPS beacon.

04:44.451 --> 04:45.452
- Copy that.

04:45.536 --> 04:46.787
- [Peter] Sending
you the package now.

04:46.870 --> 04:48.205
How soon can you go?

04:48.789 --> 04:49.873
- We'll leave at dawn.

04:49.957 --> 04:51.125
- [Peter] Excellent.

04:51.709 --> 04:53.293
Let me know when
you're on your way.

04:53.669 --> 04:54.670
- Will do.

04:54.753 --> 04:55.921
- [Peter] Copy that.

04:59.008 --> 05:00.300
- Not a long time.

05:01.301 --> 05:02.594
- Hey, I will have you know

05:02.678 --> 05:04.304
it is a perfectly
average amount of time

05:04.388 --> 05:05.639
that I like to utilize.

05:05.723 --> 05:07.433
- I'm sure.
- "I'm sure."

05:08.684 --> 05:10.102
Oh no, I know that look.

05:10.185 --> 05:12.229
That is "we're going
back to work" look.

05:12.730 --> 05:13.647
- Yep.

05:14.481 --> 05:15.357
Where's Sarah?

05:15.482 --> 05:17.401
- She's picking Jordan
up at the airport.

05:18.485 --> 05:20.446
- So, boss, how
much time we got?

05:21.447 --> 05:23.949
- Unfortunately, not enough.

05:25.034 --> 05:26.160
It's back to work.

05:27.453 --> 05:30.372
(ominous tempo music)

05:30.456 --> 05:33.625
(boat horn blowing)

05:37.755 --> 05:39.757
(crickets chirping)

05:47.723 --> 05:50.392
(ominous tempo music)

05:54.521 --> 05:55.773
- Got your text.

06:18.879 --> 06:20.214
- Welcome back, brother.

06:21.048 --> 06:22.091
Good to see you.

06:25.219 --> 06:26.929
You can put your stuff
in the back.

06:35.521 --> 06:37.314
- You think he's
ready to come back?

06:37.397 --> 06:38.774
- He's here, isn't he?

06:45.656 --> 06:48.617
(ocean waves sloshing)

06:50.536 --> 06:53.372
- Northeast of Barbados we'll
fly into a hidden island.

06:53.747 --> 06:54.832
Esperanca.

06:55.749 --> 06:58.502
It's an exclusive island reserved
for the rich and powerful.

06:58.585 --> 07:01.171
Less than a thousand people,
even at its most crowded.

07:02.548 --> 07:05.676
Has a couple of resorts,
small urban center,

07:06.635 --> 07:09.638
and lots of big homes owned
by very wealthy people.

07:09.721 --> 07:12.099
- Our client, Laura Hamilton,

07:12.307 --> 07:14.309
widow of tech billionaire
Lloyd Hamilton.

07:14.601 --> 07:16.436
He was assassinated
a year ago in Prague,

07:16.520 --> 07:19.481
so she fled to Esperanca
and has been in hiding ever since.

07:19.857 --> 07:22.359
Her mansion is secluded and far
away from the main resorts

07:22.442 --> 07:23.652
and the main city.

07:23.735 --> 07:25.904
- Are there any photos
of the mansion

07:25.988 --> 07:27.406
that we can use for reference?

07:27.698 --> 07:28.574
- Nope.

07:28.657 --> 07:30.576
The elites like to hide
from the world here.

07:30.868 --> 07:32.786
They pay a lot of money
to make sure this place is

07:32.870 --> 07:34.746
off the grid and out
of Google Maps.

07:36.498 --> 07:37.499
- All right.

07:37.749 --> 07:40.794
We go in, get the clients
and get out.

07:41.170 --> 07:42.462
Three hours, tops.

07:42.838 --> 07:45.966
We land like civilians so we
don't draw too much attention.

07:46.383 --> 07:48.760
Jordan, you're on over watch.

07:49.052 --> 07:52.389
Leo, you'll monitor
the client's GPS location.

07:52.764 --> 07:53.891
We're going in blind, people.

07:54.474 --> 07:56.185
So stay sharp and be
ready for anything.

07:56.476 --> 07:57.561
- Yee-haw.

07:59.271 --> 08:00.522
- Let's do this.

08:00.606 --> 08:01.732
(gun cranking)

08:06.153 --> 08:09.156
(lively tempo music)

08:21.126 --> 08:22.836
(phone ringing)

08:28.300 --> 08:29.176
- Ryan.

08:29.259 --> 08:30.594
- [Peter] We've
lost the GPS beacon.

08:30.677 --> 08:31.929
What is your status?

08:32.012 --> 08:33.013
- On route.

08:33.513 --> 08:34.848
30 minutes out from the island.

08:34.932 --> 08:36.058
- [Peter] Excellent.
Update me

08:36.141 --> 08:37.476
as soon as you
have the client secure.

08:37.559 --> 08:38.518
- Will do.

08:38.602 --> 08:39.561
- [Peter] Copy that.

08:40.312 --> 08:43.315
(lively tempo music)

08:57.663 --> 09:01.166
(dramatic vocalization music)

09:23.981 --> 09:26.984
(ominous tempo music)

09:29.278 --> 09:32.197
(computer beeping)

09:35.492 --> 09:38.203
(eerie music)

10:19.411 --> 10:21.538
(ominous tempo music)

10:31.631 --> 10:33.925
- Well, a lot less
people than I expected.

10:39.556 --> 10:41.308
- Let's gear up
and clear the building.

10:41.475 --> 10:43.477
(suspenseful tempo music)

10:43.560 --> 10:45.812
(guns cranking)

11:30.816 --> 11:33.819
(lively tempo music)

12:11.481 --> 12:12.941
(Sarah screaming)

12:13.024 --> 12:14.776
(electronic humming)

12:19.364 --> 12:21.116
(Ryan groaning)

12:24.411 --> 12:27.456
(eerie music)

12:28.832 --> 12:31.460
(Ryan grunting)

12:31.543 --> 12:32.836
- Talk to me, brother.

12:32.919 --> 12:33.879
Talk to me!

12:33.962 --> 12:35.755
(Ryan groaning)

12:36.047 --> 12:37.048
- You hear it?

12:37.132 --> 12:38.133
- Hear what?

12:38.425 --> 12:40.093
- That fucking noise.

12:43.763 --> 12:45.807
(Leo gasping)

12:47.476 --> 12:49.227
(ominous music)

12:49.311 --> 12:50.770
- What the fuck was that?

12:51.104 --> 12:52.564
What the fuck was that?

12:58.945 --> 13:00.906
- Let's find the others.

13:10.040 --> 13:11.291
- What the hell was that?

13:12.709 --> 13:13.710
- No idea.

13:17.964 --> 13:18.965
Did you guys hear that?

13:19.049 --> 13:19.925
- Yeah.

13:20.008 --> 13:21.301
- Yeah, it wasn't
a fucking siren.

13:21.384 --> 13:22.552
- You did too?

13:25.096 --> 13:27.140
The network functions
have been disabled.

13:27.557 --> 13:29.142
Can you check your device?

13:29.476 --> 13:31.144
- Can these things be
shut down remotely?

13:31.228 --> 13:33.480
- It can be but that's
some high level shit.

13:34.814 --> 13:36.525
The Hamiltons' GPS location
hasn't changed

13:36.608 --> 13:38.902
since this morning but I can't
get it to update now!

13:40.445 --> 13:43.114
Somebody put us in the dark.

13:43.198 --> 13:45.242
(foreboding music)

13:45.325 --> 13:46.743
- We stick to the plan.

13:47.494 --> 13:48.495
Find the client.

13:49.037 --> 13:49.913
Let's move out.

13:52.541 --> 13:55.627
(lively tempo music)

13:59.798 --> 14:01.716
(computer beeping)

14:01.800 --> 14:04.344
(eerie music)

14:37.377 --> 14:38.628
- Vehicle ahead.

15:00.275 --> 15:01.276
- Don't touch that.

15:04.237 --> 15:06.740
(eerie music)

15:16.916 --> 15:18.126
- We're good?

15:20.712 --> 15:21.713
- That's strange.

15:22.464 --> 15:23.548
When I touched it back there,

15:23.632 --> 15:24.966
that's when the noise went off.

15:28.470 --> 15:29.554
- [Ryan] Let's move.

15:29.638 --> 15:31.181
- [Leo] Hit it like a
red-headed step child!

15:31.264 --> 15:32.390
Woo!

15:32.807 --> 15:34.809
(engine rumbling)

15:38.146 --> 15:41.024
(ominous music)

15:50.492 --> 15:53.495
(lively tempo music)

16:27.654 --> 16:28.613
Oh, shit.

16:30.198 --> 16:31.491
- What's the holdup?

16:31.574 --> 16:32.742
- Code's not working.

16:37.080 --> 16:37.956
- Leo!

16:38.039 --> 16:39.374
- Give me a goddamn second!

16:40.542 --> 16:42.127
Sorry, boss.

16:48.842 --> 16:51.553
(electronic beeping)

16:59.352 --> 17:00.520
- [Ryan] Leo?

17:00.687 --> 17:02.814
- One second, hold on.

17:02.897 --> 17:03.815
We're in.

17:04.190 --> 17:06.151
(gate clanking)

17:13.241 --> 17:15.702
(atmosphere humming)
(man indistinctly shouting)

17:17.829 --> 17:20.957
(eerie music)

17:27.172 --> 17:28.465
- [Ryan] Slower.

17:29.048 --> 17:30.675
(atmosphere whooshing)

17:31.509 --> 17:32.886
- [Man] You're not my son!

17:34.179 --> 17:36.014
(atmosphere whooshing)

17:44.814 --> 17:47.442
(atmosphere humming)

17:50.862 --> 17:52.864
(ocean waves rumbling)

18:03.124 --> 18:05.293
(eerie music)

18:05.502 --> 18:08.379
(computer beeping)

18:12.675 --> 18:16.095
(lively drumming music)

18:38.660 --> 18:42.872
(gentle tempo music)

19:35.008 --> 19:37.260
(atmosphere buzzing)

19:43.099 --> 19:44.225
- Leo.

19:50.732 --> 19:54.527
(ocean waves sloshing)

20:00.658 --> 20:03.828
(eerie music)

20:05.246 --> 20:09.250
(children screaming)
(rollercoaster clattering)

20:09.500 --> 20:12.128
- [Man] We need to sedate
this piece of shit!

20:12.211 --> 20:13.671
You're not my son!

20:13.922 --> 20:16.841
(atmosphere rumbling)

20:18.051 --> 20:20.178
(police siren)

20:21.262 --> 20:22.263
- What's happening?

20:23.723 --> 20:25.850
(atmosphere ringing)

20:27.393 --> 20:29.646
(ominous music)

20:30.104 --> 20:31.064
- You okay?

20:34.192 --> 20:35.234
- Yeah.

20:36.277 --> 20:38.237
Yeah, I'm fine.
I'm good, let's go.

20:38.488 --> 20:39.447
- Okay.

20:40.114 --> 20:42.033
(Sarah huffing)

20:47.455 --> 20:48.957
(eerie music)

20:50.166 --> 20:51.459
(Leo grunting)

21:01.219 --> 21:02.178
- Okay.

21:02.887 --> 21:05.640
(gentle tempo music)

21:54.439 --> 21:56.733
(fan buzzing)

22:01.154 --> 22:04.574
(woman screaming)

22:06.159 --> 22:07.994
- Hey! It's okay!

22:08.077 --> 22:10.580
I'm with Castle International,
I'm here to help you!

22:10.788 --> 22:12.582
It's okay!
Calm down!

22:12.665 --> 22:13.708
- Okay.

22:13.791 --> 22:15.918
- I'm here to help you,
I promise, I promise.

22:16.294 --> 22:18.379
- I can't hear anymore!

22:18.671 --> 22:19.630
I can't!

22:19.714 --> 22:21.215
- It's okay.
It's okay!

22:21.299 --> 22:22.508
It's okay, calm down!

22:22.592 --> 22:23.468
- Okay.

22:26.054 --> 22:27.638
- [Laura] The light
took everyone.

22:27.805 --> 22:29.640
- You're injured,
you're injured, okay?

22:29.724 --> 22:31.225
Let me see.
Let me see.

22:31.309 --> 22:33.436
(Laura crying)

22:36.272 --> 22:37.857
- I tried to stop it.

22:37.982 --> 22:39.025
- Stop what?

22:39.776 --> 22:40.693
The waves?

22:42.945 --> 22:45.239
- Now I can't hear it anymore.

22:45.615 --> 22:47.450
- [Leila] It's okay, it's okay.

22:48.534 --> 22:50.119
- But it doesn't matter.

22:52.288 --> 22:53.790
It's already inside.

22:54.624 --> 22:55.958
- It's okay, Laura.

22:56.042 --> 22:57.460
You're safe with us, okay?

22:57.543 --> 22:59.378
We can figure this out
on the boat.

23:04.592 --> 23:05.676
- No one is safe.

23:07.261 --> 23:08.429
No one.

23:08.513 --> 23:11.724
(eerie music)

23:16.604 --> 23:18.856
- You ever hear
of Havana Syndrome?

23:19.398 --> 23:20.399
- Yeah.

23:21.400 --> 23:22.485
Yeah.

23:23.111 --> 23:25.613
Something about U.S. diplomats
in Cuban getting sick

23:25.696 --> 23:27.990
and blaming it on sound waves.

23:28.074 --> 23:29.283
- Ultrasound.

23:29.492 --> 23:30.701
RF energy.

23:31.536 --> 23:34.747
High frequencies beyond
our range of hearing.

23:35.123 --> 23:37.625
Causes all sorts of problems
in the neural pathways.

23:39.085 --> 23:42.130
- Well, whatever it is,
we can hear it,

23:42.630 --> 23:44.090
and this ain't Havana.

23:44.632 --> 23:46.509
- See, that's the problem
here, boss.

23:46.759 --> 23:49.137
You don't know if it is
or isn't affecting you

23:50.221 --> 23:51.681
until it's too late.

23:55.560 --> 23:57.145
- You're creeping me out, Leo.

23:57.311 --> 23:58.437
Save it for the debrief.

23:58.521 --> 23:59.480
Let's move out!

23:59.647 --> 24:02.024
(suspenseful music)

24:02.733 --> 24:04.527
(engine rumbling)

24:15.913 --> 24:16.998
Why are we stopping?

24:20.668 --> 24:22.128
- I secured that gate.

24:22.461 --> 24:25.506
(electrical fizzling)

24:27.800 --> 24:29.552
(Laura screaming)

24:34.974 --> 24:37.518
(gunshots popping)

24:38.269 --> 24:40.021
- Client's shot, client's shot!

24:40.104 --> 24:41.397
- [Ryan] Do we have a visual?

24:41.480 --> 24:42.440
- I got nothing!

24:42.523 --> 24:43.566
- How's she doing back there?

24:43.649 --> 24:45.526
- [Sarah] I don't think
she's gonna make it!

24:46.068 --> 24:47.153
- [Leo] We gotta move!

24:49.363 --> 24:51.199
(eerie music)

24:51.699 --> 24:52.950
Let's move, let's move!

24:54.535 --> 24:56.078
We gotta move!

25:02.376 --> 25:05.588
(suspenseful music)

25:15.640 --> 25:16.807
- [Ryan] How's she
doing back there?

25:16.891 --> 25:18.142
- No good!

25:18.476 --> 25:20.937
(suspenseful music)

25:21.395 --> 25:23.231
(indistinct shouting)

25:26.150 --> 25:27.109
- [Ryan] Go.

25:27.193 --> 25:28.778
- Fuck.
- Leila, move, come on!

25:28.861 --> 25:30.988
Leila, there's a medic bag
in my bag.

25:31.072 --> 25:32.114
- [Ryan] You got her?

25:32.198 --> 25:33.324
- Ryan!

25:33.741 --> 25:34.825
Ryan?
- Yeah?

25:36.244 --> 25:37.828
Where's that medical kit?

25:38.287 --> 25:41.332
(lively tempo music)

25:41.874 --> 25:43.793
- Shit, fuck, fuck.

25:44.502 --> 25:46.170
Fuck, she's not responding.

25:46.254 --> 25:47.630
Fuck! No!

25:47.964 --> 25:49.131
- [Ryan] Leila.

25:49.423 --> 25:51.384
(Leila huffing)

25:57.014 --> 25:58.015
- Fuck.

25:58.933 --> 25:59.809
- [Ryan] Stop!

25:59.892 --> 26:00.768
- [Leila] Fuck.

26:00.851 --> 26:02.019
- Leila, stop!

26:02.103 --> 26:03.020
She's gone!

26:03.104 --> 26:04.647
Leila, she's gone.

26:07.900 --> 26:09.026
- Fuck!

26:09.527 --> 26:12.530
(ominous music)

26:21.872 --> 26:24.959
(melancholic music)

26:45.062 --> 26:47.565
- Boss, I'm gonna
go get the boat.

26:49.525 --> 26:50.776
- Keep your eyes open.

26:50.901 --> 26:51.944
- [Leo] Shit.

26:52.236 --> 26:53.487
For what?

27:00.786 --> 27:01.996
- It was a mistake.

27:04.165 --> 27:06.500
Should've never asked
you to bring Jordan back.

27:09.170 --> 27:10.254
Wasn't ready.

27:12.673 --> 27:14.425
Just froze in the car.

27:23.726 --> 27:24.727
- Doesn't matter.

27:28.606 --> 27:30.399
Let's go home,
the mission's over.

27:32.860 --> 27:36.322
(melancholic music)

27:57.676 --> 27:58.803
(alarm beeping)

27:58.886 --> 28:00.262
- Hit the snooze.

28:00.596 --> 28:02.473
I need 10 more minutes.

28:06.519 --> 28:07.895
I love you.

28:17.780 --> 28:20.783
(foreboding music)

28:40.136 --> 28:41.387
- No, no, no.

28:41.637 --> 28:42.680
Where's the boat?

28:42.763 --> 28:44.265
The boat is fucking gone!

28:45.391 --> 28:47.143
Where the shit are you?

28:48.519 --> 28:49.687
Fuck.

28:49.979 --> 28:52.273
- [Man] Where you
wandering off to, boy?

28:52.356 --> 28:54.066
Think you can turn
your back on me?

28:55.401 --> 28:57.570
(Leo mumbling)

28:59.989 --> 29:01.282
- Come on, Leo.

29:01.365 --> 29:02.741
Come on, snap out of it.

29:02.825 --> 29:04.577
He's not real,
he's fucking dead.

29:05.327 --> 29:06.996
He's a dead piece of shit.

29:08.164 --> 29:09.457
He's fucking dead.

29:09.790 --> 29:11.167
He's fucking dead.

29:14.712 --> 29:16.380
Fucking damn it.

29:24.346 --> 29:27.349
(eerie music)

29:57.213 --> 30:01.467
(unsettling music)

30:09.350 --> 30:11.894
(Leila groaning)

30:25.741 --> 30:27.159
(Leila groaning)

30:37.503 --> 30:40.506
(unsettling music)

31:11.287 --> 31:14.999
(ominous music)

31:25.801 --> 31:27.386
- What's she doing?

31:29.096 --> 31:31.390
(lively tempo music)

31:38.647 --> 31:39.607
Leila?

31:41.984 --> 31:43.777
(music intensifying)

31:45.321 --> 31:46.280
Leila?

31:48.407 --> 31:49.575
Leila, no!

31:49.867 --> 31:50.784
(gunshot booming)

31:52.661 --> 31:55.039
(dramatic vocalization music)

32:02.880 --> 32:07.426
(Ryan yelling)

32:19.855 --> 32:21.899
(Ryan screaming)

32:22.983 --> 32:25.319
(dramatic vocalization music)

32:52.763 --> 32:56.767
(gentle piano music)

33:06.193 --> 33:08.028
(bird squawking)

33:11.490 --> 33:14.076
(crickets chirping)

33:22.251 --> 33:25.003
- We need to find
a way off this nightmare.

33:30.175 --> 33:31.260
I'm gonna talk to him.

33:31.343 --> 33:32.428
- Leave him be.

33:36.515 --> 33:38.267
- How much longer, huh?

33:39.184 --> 33:40.811
It's been hours.

33:46.191 --> 33:47.234
- You know,

33:49.319 --> 33:52.114
when I lost Naomi, I didn't
speak to anyone for months.

33:59.037 --> 34:00.122
- Are you okay?

34:02.166 --> 34:03.083
- I'm fine.

34:04.918 --> 34:05.878
- Because...

34:08.380 --> 34:09.506
when we got to the beach,

34:09.590 --> 34:11.091
you didn't even get
out of the car, you--

34:11.175 --> 34:12.217
- I said I'm fine!

34:14.928 --> 34:18.474
(gentle music)

34:42.414 --> 34:43.707
- Boss, I...

34:49.505 --> 34:53.550
- Are we finally gonna talk
about what the fuck is going on?

34:54.718 --> 34:55.594
Huh?

34:57.095 --> 34:58.889
About this empty island!

34:58.972 --> 35:01.934
About the fucking sound,
the fucking sound!

35:02.935 --> 35:05.312
- That sound is freaking
me the fuck out.

35:06.605 --> 35:08.774
All right, it jammed
our communications.

35:11.026 --> 35:12.486
It could be some advanced tech.

35:12.569 --> 35:15.030
- Who?
Who's advanced tech, huh?

35:15.113 --> 35:16.907
- I don't know, I don't know!

35:17.991 --> 35:18.951
The Chinese?

35:19.034 --> 35:21.245
It's the Russians,
the goddamn U.S. Government.

35:21.328 --> 35:22.246
- Fucking Chinese?

35:22.329 --> 35:24.081
The fucking Chinese,
that doesn't even make sense!

35:24.164 --> 35:25.249
- I don't fucking know, Sarah,

35:25.332 --> 35:27.000
don't yell at me, huh?
- Fuck you!

35:27.084 --> 35:28.794
- Don't fucking yell at me! Fuck you!
- Fuck you!

35:28.877 --> 35:29.837
- Hey!

35:29.920 --> 35:31.421
- Fuck!
- Hey!

35:35.717 --> 35:36.718
Does it matter?

35:38.470 --> 35:39.763
- Does it fucking matter?

35:41.223 --> 35:42.349
Look where we are.

35:44.434 --> 35:48.897
- Wow, we need to get
off of this island.

35:49.189 --> 35:51.149
Okay, before the same thing
that happened to Leila

35:51.233 --> 35:52.609
happens to us, okay?

35:54.945 --> 35:57.155
I'm fucking losing it.

35:58.240 --> 35:59.533
I saw Samuel.

36:00.659 --> 36:03.787
Fucking flash, I saw
a flash and saw Samuel

36:03.871 --> 36:06.748
and I saw the day he
fucking died at the house.

36:07.291 --> 36:08.709
I'm fucking going crazy.

36:08.792 --> 36:10.335
- Sarah, I've seen
the same shit.

36:10.419 --> 36:13.213
Okay, okay, yeah, I don't
think you're going crazy, okay?

36:13.297 --> 36:15.549
After I heard the sound,
I've been hearing my dad.

36:16.258 --> 36:19.094
And that abusive piece
of shit used to beat me,

36:19.469 --> 36:21.805
beat my sisters and my mom,

36:22.806 --> 36:24.182
and now it's all
I fucking hear.

36:26.852 --> 36:28.437
It's gotta be something here.

36:30.856 --> 36:31.773
Boss?

36:33.817 --> 36:34.943
- Me too.

36:36.820 --> 36:38.155
I've been hearing...

36:39.615 --> 36:40.824
children screaming.

36:42.576 --> 36:43.660
Drowning.

36:46.413 --> 36:47.581
Like back in New Orleans

36:47.664 --> 36:49.541
when I was stationed
there during Katrina.

36:50.125 --> 36:52.252
- Yeah, but you didn't
even hear a sound.

36:55.881 --> 36:56.965
- No.

36:57.215 --> 36:58.216
Nothing.

37:00.469 --> 37:02.095
But whatever's going
on with you guys,

37:03.221 --> 37:05.641
I have a strange feeling it's coming
from the top of that mountain.

37:09.770 --> 37:10.771
- Power.

37:12.022 --> 37:13.148
Yeah?

37:13.982 --> 37:16.652
We cut off their power
and we disable

37:16.818 --> 37:19.404
whatever the fucking
source of that sound is.

37:24.159 --> 37:25.118
- All right.

37:26.745 --> 37:27.955
Let's give it a shot.

37:29.081 --> 37:30.832
So we cut
the power to the island

37:30.916 --> 37:32.751
then try to find the source.

37:33.210 --> 37:35.128
We make whoever's
responsible pay.

37:36.088 --> 37:38.590
(ominous music)

38:03.490 --> 38:06.493
(crickets chirping)

38:08.912 --> 38:10.539
(creature screeching)

38:11.790 --> 38:13.917
(eerie music)

38:16.420 --> 38:17.838
(glass clinking)

38:30.142 --> 38:31.184
Keep moving.

38:31.768 --> 38:33.103
(creature growling)

38:39.818 --> 38:42.029
(distant metal clanking)

38:43.780 --> 38:46.783
(ominous tempo music)

39:01.131 --> 39:02.340
(distant metal clanking)

39:08.513 --> 39:09.973
(creature screeching)

39:12.309 --> 39:14.352
(crickets chirping)

39:24.696 --> 39:27.783
(lively tempo music)

39:32.370 --> 39:34.915
(distant glass crackling)

39:46.510 --> 39:47.469
Exit left.

39:50.514 --> 39:53.517
(lively tempo music)

40:09.866 --> 40:12.869
(crickets chirping)

40:17.457 --> 40:20.460
(lively tempo music)

40:36.726 --> 40:40.730
(screams echoing)

40:49.364 --> 40:53.285
(rollercoaster rails clanking)

40:56.454 --> 40:59.457
(screams echoing)

41:04.754 --> 41:07.757
(ominous music)

41:21.855 --> 41:22.898
- Help me.

41:25.442 --> 41:26.610
Help me.

41:32.365 --> 41:33.783
- I'm so sorry.

41:33.992 --> 41:35.577
I'm really sorry, I tried.

41:36.077 --> 41:38.622
(police sirens echoing)

41:38.705 --> 41:40.290
- (Ryan mumbling)
- [Girl] Help me.

41:41.208 --> 41:44.211
(dramatic music)

42:01.937 --> 42:05.232
(Ryan mumbling)

42:07.567 --> 42:08.818
- I'm so sorry.

42:10.862 --> 42:11.988
I tried.

42:14.574 --> 42:15.617
I really tried.

42:17.827 --> 42:19.496
I couldn't do anything.

42:20.664 --> 42:23.667
(dramatic music)

42:25.126 --> 42:26.086
Just...

42:29.714 --> 42:31.007
There was nothing I could do.

42:31.883 --> 42:34.886
(dramatic music)

43:02.330 --> 43:03.373
- Hold up.

43:05.959 --> 43:07.085
We've lost Ryan.

43:09.921 --> 43:12.924
(eerie music)

43:29.441 --> 43:32.736
(computer beeping)
(creature growling)

43:35.697 --> 43:37.073
- Help me.

43:40.785 --> 43:43.288
(Ryan crying)

43:45.415 --> 43:46.416
- I'm sorry.

43:50.211 --> 43:51.296
I tried.

43:52.964 --> 43:54.257
I really tried.

43:57.594 --> 44:00.221
(foreboding music)

44:06.102 --> 44:08.104
(atmosphere whooshing)

44:10.940 --> 44:11.941
- Ryan!

44:12.567 --> 44:14.652
(music intensifying)

44:14.819 --> 44:16.946
(computer beeping)

44:18.656 --> 44:20.825
(thunder rumbling)
(Ryan screaming)

44:22.077 --> 44:24.371
(lively music)

44:25.372 --> 44:26.831
- What the?

44:31.878 --> 44:33.713
(eerie music)

44:35.006 --> 44:37.175
- Fall back.
(Sarah crying)

44:37.258 --> 44:38.301
Fall back!

44:39.052 --> 44:41.262
- What the fuck is happening?

44:41.346 --> 44:44.349
(suspenseful music)

44:51.439 --> 44:52.440
What is that?

44:52.899 --> 44:55.026
(creature growling)

44:55.860 --> 44:57.070
What is that?

44:57.320 --> 45:00.323
(suspenseful music)

45:12.919 --> 45:16.297
(door rattling)

45:21.636 --> 45:22.971
(electronic humming)

45:23.054 --> 45:24.639
(creature growling)

45:42.574 --> 45:44.826
(creature snarling)

45:57.505 --> 46:02.302
(electronic humming)

46:07.140 --> 46:08.766
(door thudding)

46:15.273 --> 46:17.775
(eerie music)

46:19.402 --> 46:20.695
Clear.

46:28.369 --> 46:32.290
- Don't you ever
fucking touch me again.

46:35.502 --> 46:37.253
- We wanna leave,
we gotta go now.

46:38.880 --> 46:39.839
Right now.

46:42.592 --> 46:45.178
(foreboding music)

46:46.971 --> 46:49.974
(lively tempo music)

47:07.700 --> 47:10.703
(eerie music)

47:32.684 --> 47:35.687
(intense music)

47:56.708 --> 47:58.459
(gun cranking)

48:02.755 --> 48:05.425
(lively tempo music)

48:45.965 --> 48:48.968
(suspenseful tempo music)

48:57.644 --> 49:00.063
(Sarah crying)

49:11.532 --> 49:12.825
- Power here.

49:13.451 --> 49:14.577
Set it up.

49:15.036 --> 49:18.206
Which would feed me into five,

49:18.706 --> 49:19.832
six.

49:22.960 --> 49:25.963
(ominous music)

49:39.519 --> 49:40.603
No.

49:44.607 --> 49:46.234
No, no, no, no.

49:49.737 --> 49:51.072
(Leo groaning)

49:53.366 --> 49:54.367
Come on.

49:54.617 --> 49:56.661
Come on, come on, come on.

49:56.744 --> 49:58.705
No, no, no, no.

50:00.123 --> 50:02.333
(foreboding music)

50:03.459 --> 50:04.460
Uh...

50:05.837 --> 50:08.256
This is, this is strange.

50:08.840 --> 50:09.882
- What's strange?

50:10.383 --> 50:11.467
- Um...

50:12.093 --> 50:17.181
These are the power relays
for the whole island and,

50:18.182 --> 50:21.811
you know, everything
feeds through here but...

50:22.353 --> 50:23.396
it's not...

50:26.149 --> 50:27.108
I...

50:29.944 --> 50:31.279
It's not working, boss.

50:33.281 --> 50:35.199
- [Sarah] What is wrong
with you both?

50:39.036 --> 50:41.289
Did you see what
happened back there?

50:41.539 --> 50:44.500
(gentle music)

50:44.584 --> 50:45.585
Are you blind?

50:47.128 --> 50:49.213
Did you not see
what happened to Ryan?

50:51.174 --> 50:52.467
It's hopeless.

50:55.386 --> 50:56.721
It's hopeless.

50:57.805 --> 51:00.391
(Sarah crying)

51:03.853 --> 51:06.481
Whatever you try to do,
it's not gonna work.

51:08.024 --> 51:11.235
- Sarah, we're trying
to get us off the island.

51:16.282 --> 51:20.912
- What's ever happening here,
it's beyond our understanding.

51:23.122 --> 51:24.540
Our focus is to survive.

51:26.584 --> 51:27.919
- We're already dead.

51:29.253 --> 51:30.421
(radio buzzing)

51:30.505 --> 51:31.672
- [Man] Anyone out there?

51:35.843 --> 51:37.178
- Don't touch that.

51:38.137 --> 51:40.097
Don't touch that.

51:40.515 --> 51:41.641
It's a trap.

51:41.724 --> 51:42.767
Just don't!

51:44.477 --> 51:45.478
- Hey.

51:50.358 --> 51:51.484
- Stand down.

51:59.408 --> 52:01.994
(gentle music)

52:03.496 --> 52:04.455
Sarah.

52:05.248 --> 52:06.207
Breathe.

52:06.332 --> 52:09.335
(Sarah heavily breathing)

52:16.676 --> 52:18.594
Do you remember
the first time that we met?

52:20.346 --> 52:23.099
(gentle piano music)

52:23.391 --> 52:27.103
I was standing at the bar
and Samuel was next to me.

52:29.438 --> 52:31.023
He couldn't take
his eyes off you.

52:34.569 --> 52:36.279
And you were standing
in the corner,

52:38.489 --> 52:40.575
the way that you would
look at each other...

52:42.201 --> 52:44.120
You were laughing and dancing.

52:46.998 --> 52:48.791
I watched you two fall
in love that night.

52:48.875 --> 52:50.042
(Sarah chuckling)

52:50.126 --> 52:51.127
- Yeah.

52:55.506 --> 52:56.841
- It really showed me...

52:59.844 --> 53:01.345
It showed me how
to fall in love.

53:03.973 --> 53:05.391
And when I met Naomi,

53:09.812 --> 53:11.647
you were no longer with him.

53:16.485 --> 53:18.154
Now close your eyes,

53:19.697 --> 53:20.740
okay?

53:22.283 --> 53:23.326
Rest.

53:25.286 --> 53:26.329
Be present.

53:29.165 --> 53:30.207
And breathe.

53:32.043 --> 53:33.210
Focus on your breath.

53:35.504 --> 53:38.507
(gentle piano music)

53:45.598 --> 53:48.601
(foreboding music)

53:56.817 --> 53:58.736
I'm gonna take the night shift.

54:09.705 --> 54:12.708
(eerie music)

54:19.382 --> 54:20.883
(thunder rumbling)

54:25.096 --> 54:27.431
(intense music)

54:32.353 --> 54:35.356
(birds chirping)

54:55.751 --> 54:58.754
(ominous tempo music)

55:04.760 --> 55:05.636
You good?

55:05.720 --> 55:06.637
- Yeah.

55:07.638 --> 55:08.639
Where to?

55:09.932 --> 55:12.810
- Well, we're gonna go
see a guy about a walkie.

55:17.440 --> 55:19.650
(sinister music)

55:25.448 --> 55:28.701
(computer beeping)
(creature breathing)

55:32.079 --> 55:35.082
(ominous tempo music)

56:09.033 --> 56:12.411
(trees crackling)

56:24.673 --> 56:27.676
(eerie music)

56:53.119 --> 56:54.245
(atmosphere rumbling)

56:54.328 --> 56:55.996
- [Father] Sit there,
you miserable piece of shit!

56:56.080 --> 56:57.623
You're not my son!

56:58.833 --> 57:00.668
Ain't you got any fight in you?

57:01.252 --> 57:02.920
Sit there,
you miserable piece of shit!

57:03.003 --> 57:04.463
You're not my son!

57:04.713 --> 57:06.173
Ain't you got any fight in you?

57:06.257 --> 57:07.925
Hell, your mama was
tougher than you

57:08.008 --> 57:09.051
and I killed that bitch!

57:12.096 --> 57:15.099
(foreboding music)

57:22.773 --> 57:25.776
(computer chiming)

57:27.987 --> 57:30.990
(eerie music)

57:42.251 --> 57:45.254
(ominous tempo music)

57:59.268 --> 58:00.853
(metal clanking)

58:06.859 --> 58:08.986
(object clattering)

58:14.867 --> 58:16.452
(metal clattering)

58:27.379 --> 58:28.839
(objects rustling)

58:36.680 --> 58:38.182
- I spoke to you on the radio.

58:39.266 --> 58:40.643
If you can exit the building.

58:43.520 --> 58:45.147
I will give you
to the count of three.

58:48.067 --> 58:49.026
One.

58:51.278 --> 58:52.738
Two.

58:52.821 --> 58:55.824
(ominous music)

59:02.331 --> 59:04.083
- Have you seen them?

59:04.208 --> 59:06.377
- We've seen
a lot of shit, sir.

59:07.628 --> 59:08.879
Come on out.

59:08.963 --> 59:10.464
- That thing from the sky.

59:12.341 --> 59:13.384
That light.

59:16.720 --> 59:18.055
- Mr. Shoenburg.

59:19.682 --> 59:20.641
We're here to help.

59:21.225 --> 59:22.268
- Do you know him?

59:22.518 --> 59:23.978
- Yeah, that's
Albert Shoenburg.

59:24.061 --> 59:26.647
He's a big tech guy
worth about 50 bill.

59:27.231 --> 59:28.190
Albert.

59:30.025 --> 59:31.277
My name's Leo.

59:31.527 --> 59:34.405
I'm gonna put my gun
down now, all right?

59:36.657 --> 59:39.076
This is Sarah and Jordan.

59:39.827 --> 59:40.703
Put your gun down.

59:42.871 --> 59:45.874
(eerie music)

59:53.549 --> 59:54.842
All right, we're here to help.

59:56.302 --> 59:57.553
Hey, hey, hey.

59:57.636 --> 59:58.929
Whoa, hey!

59:59.013 --> 59:59.930
Hey.

01:00:00.264 --> 01:00:01.557
Let's put down the gun.

01:00:01.640 --> 01:00:04.226
All right, buddy, we are
on the same side here.

01:00:04.643 --> 01:00:06.520
- Something came from the sky.

01:00:07.229 --> 01:00:08.522
There was an earthquake!

01:00:08.939 --> 01:00:09.982
- We know.

01:00:10.065 --> 01:00:11.108
- Lower,

01:00:11.567 --> 01:00:13.068
lower your gun.

01:00:13.152 --> 01:00:14.570
(Albert groaning)

01:00:15.237 --> 01:00:16.405
- And then the sound came.

01:00:19.742 --> 01:00:20.659
That sound!

01:00:22.578 --> 01:00:23.954
It goes inside your mind!

01:00:25.456 --> 01:00:27.499
- Hey, that's good, we wanna
hear your story, all right?

01:00:27.916 --> 01:00:29.626
We're all gonna
listen to your story.

01:00:29.710 --> 01:00:32.171
Just put down the gun.

01:00:33.464 --> 01:00:34.840
- You can't hide from it.

01:00:35.632 --> 01:00:36.925
You can't run.

01:00:38.594 --> 01:00:39.511
I tried.

01:00:39.595 --> 01:00:40.929
I can't hear.

01:00:41.597 --> 01:00:42.598
Make it stop.

01:00:42.681 --> 01:00:43.682
- Calm it down, brother.

01:00:43.766 --> 01:00:46.810
All right, let's
all calm down, okay?

01:00:48.020 --> 01:00:49.646
There's no more noise,
it stopped.

01:00:49.730 --> 01:00:51.398
- You can't stop it.

01:00:52.900 --> 01:00:54.276
You can't stop this!

01:00:54.360 --> 01:00:55.569
No!

01:00:55.944 --> 01:00:57.029
No!

01:00:57.780 --> 01:00:58.864
No!

01:00:59.198 --> 01:01:00.574
You with them?

01:01:01.033 --> 01:01:02.493
Who are you?

01:01:02.701 --> 01:01:04.203
Who are you with? No!

01:01:04.286 --> 01:01:05.579
No, no, no!

01:01:05.662 --> 01:01:07.122
(gunshot booming)

01:01:10.084 --> 01:01:12.586
(birds chirping)

01:01:15.464 --> 01:01:17.925
- You just killed one
of the richest men in the world.

01:01:19.802 --> 01:01:21.345
- Yeah, but he wouldn't
shut the fuck up.

01:01:23.263 --> 01:01:24.598
(gun cranking)

01:01:24.681 --> 01:01:26.058
Let's move out.

01:01:33.982 --> 01:01:36.235
- He's a lot shorter
in real life, you know?

01:01:38.070 --> 01:01:41.073
(sinister music)

01:01:54.211 --> 01:01:55.337
- I'm tired.

01:01:59.133 --> 01:02:00.509
- Let's take five.

01:02:12.813 --> 01:02:13.897
I'm gonna scope.

01:02:15.274 --> 01:02:16.483
I'll be back.

01:02:19.403 --> 01:02:22.406
(gentle music)

01:02:30.622 --> 01:02:33.208
(Leo groaning)

01:02:34.501 --> 01:02:35.627
- Where'd he go?

01:02:36.837 --> 01:02:40.340
- He went to go
scope the perimeter.

01:02:46.138 --> 01:02:48.891
(eerie music)

01:02:49.558 --> 01:02:50.726
Huh?

01:02:55.314 --> 01:02:56.523
- I didn't say anything.

01:02:59.610 --> 01:03:00.527
- Nah.

01:03:01.487 --> 01:03:02.863
Thought I...

01:03:12.498 --> 01:03:14.166
- Why are we even here?

01:03:16.126 --> 01:03:17.169
- I...

01:03:18.879 --> 01:03:20.631
I don't fucking know.

01:03:25.552 --> 01:03:26.845
- We're all gonna die.

01:03:30.390 --> 01:03:31.433
- Maybe.

01:03:34.561 --> 01:03:35.521
Maybe...

01:03:36.605 --> 01:03:38.524
we're all already dead.

01:03:41.568 --> 01:03:42.903
Ryan's dead,

01:03:45.072 --> 01:03:46.406
Leila just...

01:03:52.246 --> 01:03:55.791
And now Jordan's taking
us up the mountain like...

01:03:58.043 --> 01:04:00.671
Virgil led Dante out of hell.

01:04:00.754 --> 01:04:03.423
Maybe that's what this is.

01:04:04.758 --> 01:04:06.718
(Leo laughing)

01:04:08.637 --> 01:04:11.139
(eerie music)

01:04:17.354 --> 01:04:18.897
- What is wrong with you?

01:04:32.744 --> 01:04:34.788
(atmosphere rumbling)

01:04:42.337 --> 01:04:43.338
Fuck!

01:04:44.172 --> 01:04:46.842
(ominous music)

01:04:50.304 --> 01:04:51.305
Baby?

01:04:55.017 --> 01:04:55.892
- No.

01:04:55.976 --> 01:04:57.978
(sinister music)

01:04:59.521 --> 01:05:01.607
No, you're dead.

01:05:01.690 --> 01:05:03.358
You're fucking dead!

01:05:03.650 --> 01:05:05.277
- Well look what we have here.

01:05:06.153 --> 01:05:07.446
Little fucking Leo.

01:05:09.281 --> 01:05:10.490
- You're not real.

01:05:11.325 --> 01:05:13.827
(unsettling music)

01:05:17.831 --> 01:05:19.333
- Oh, I missed you.

01:05:19.791 --> 01:05:22.210
- Goddamn it, son, you
miserable son of a bitch!

01:05:22.294 --> 01:05:23.462
You're not my boy!

01:05:23.545 --> 01:05:24.630
- Shut up!

01:05:27.883 --> 01:05:29.092
- I'm gonna come with you.

01:05:30.177 --> 01:05:31.178
Okay?

01:05:32.054 --> 01:05:33.430
