Come on, have a seat.

09:34.229 --> 09:35.345
Have a seat
in the big girl chair.

09:35.347 --> 09:38.581
You're a big girl now.

09:38.583 --> 09:41.084
Aunt Charity, thank you
so much for seeing us.

09:41.086 --> 09:42.685
I know your time
is very valuable.

09:42.687 --> 09:44.687
I have all the time
in the world for you.

09:44.689 --> 09:46.356
You're family.

09:46.358 --> 09:48.358
Stephanie, I'm not
doing anything important.

09:48.360 --> 09:50.944
Bring me those documents
to sign.

09:51.446 --> 09:53.780
I haven't seen
this one since I was 25

09:53.782 --> 09:55.365
and my parents cut me off.

09:55.367 --> 09:56.916
You sleep with
one Pakistani lesbian,

09:56.918 --> 09:59.118
you're out
of the family.

09:59.120 --> 10:00.837
Here, you with the big lips,
try these.

10:00.839 --> 10:02.338
Tell me which ones you hate.

10:02.340 --> 10:04.824
Aunt Charity started
her makeup empire at 26

10:04.826 --> 10:06.960
when she invented
bubblegum-flavored lip gloss.

10:06.962 --> 10:08.845
Oh, my God,
that was you?

10:08.847 --> 10:10.296
I loved that.

10:10.298 --> 10:11.998
I was wearing that
during my first kiss.

10:12.000 --> 10:15.333
And thank you, because
I got an "A" in that class.

10:15.604 --> 10:18.638
Every girl who loves
lipstick loves me,

10:18.640 --> 10:20.607
except for this one,
who hates me

10:20.609 --> 10:23.443
[mocking]
Because I was so mean

10:23.445 --> 10:26.178
and I broke
her night-night cocoa cup.

10:26.180 --> 10:29.015
Aunt Charity,
I never said you were mean.

10:29.017 --> 10:30.984
I was ten, and I just
got a little confused

10:30.986 --> 10:32.535
about what happened
to my seagull cup.

10:32.537 --> 10:33.686
But I'm an adult now.

10:33.688 --> 10:35.071
When I go night-night,

10:35.073 --> 10:36.856
I barely even think
about that cocoa cup.

10:36.858 --> 10:39.125
Caroline, I was 23.

10:39.127 --> 10:41.027
I don't remember
anything about a cup.

10:41.029 --> 10:42.328
All I remember
about that weekend

10:42.330 --> 10:43.546
was that Versace
was murdered

10:43.548 --> 10:46.332
and my dress
would obviously be late.

10:46.834 --> 10:48.551
Now, why are you here?

10:48.553 --> 10:51.087
Tell me. You have my full
and undivided attention.

10:51.089 --> 10:52.922
Where and where?

10:52.924 --> 10:55.508
Well, Aunt Charity,
as you may or may not know,

10:55.510 --> 10:57.393
I now have
a start-up business.

10:57.395 --> 11:00.728
Hey, is it me, or does
this look like a dog penis?

11:02.683 --> 11:04.684
She's fun.
Seems professional.

11:04.686 --> 11:06.552
Good choice.

11:06.954 --> 11:08.054
And, as you know,

11:08.056 --> 11:10.222
I've always respected
your business acumen.

11:10.224 --> 11:12.358
- Even when I was a little--
- How much?

11:12.360 --> 11:14.060
Fine, businesswoman
to businesswoman--

11:14.062 --> 11:16.579
I need a number.
Give me a number.

11:16.581 --> 11:18.031
25,000.

11:18.033 --> 11:21.034
And all these lipsticks,

11:21.036 --> 11:24.369
including dog penis.

11:24.873 --> 11:26.372
And I'm not asking
for a handout.

11:26.374 --> 11:29.125
- This is a business opportunity.
- No.

11:29.127 --> 11:31.427
Maybe--no.

11:31.429 --> 11:32.745
Look, Caroline,

11:32.747 --> 11:34.847
if this were truly
a business transaction,

11:34.849 --> 11:38.182
you'd have cupcakes here
to show me, but you don't.

11:38.520 --> 11:39.886
I know all about
your business.

11:39.888 --> 11:41.054
Stephanie googled you.

11:41.056 --> 11:43.273
She has the strength
to Google?

11:43.575 --> 11:46.608
Has she googled
"How to eat"?

11:48.696 --> 11:49.862
See yourselves out.

11:49.864 --> 11:52.699
I'm going to my dermatologist
for a little procedure.

11:52.701 --> 11:54.567
I want to take two years
off my face

11:54.569 --> 11:57.570
just so people will think,
"Is she 38 or 39?

11:57.572 --> 11:59.438
It's so hard to tell."

11:59.940 --> 12:02.558
But just so you know,
you were my last chance

12:02.560 --> 12:04.911
to keep my dream
and our business alive.

12:04.913 --> 12:06.579
You're resourceful.
You'll think of something.

12:06.581 --> 12:07.780
Now come here.

12:07.782 --> 12:08.948
In spite of it all,
we are family.

12:08.950 --> 12:10.249
Give me a hug.

12:10.251 --> 12:11.617
[Sighs]

12:11.619 --> 12:14.952
Ow!

12:15.973 --> 12:17.123
Wow.

12:17.125 --> 12:18.591
She's kind of a monster,

12:18.593 --> 12:21.926
but she gave me free stuff,
so I'm torn.

12:28.539 --> 12:30.706
Aunt Charity's
a smart businesswoman.

12:30.758 --> 12:32.408
She won't be able
to deny a good product.

12:32.410 --> 12:34.143
I can't believe
I'm making cupcakes

12:34.145 --> 12:36.245
so you can go back for round two
with that woman.

12:36.247 --> 12:39.315
Auntie Charity
might be the anti-Christ.

12:39.567 --> 12:42.685
I'll do anything
to keep our business going.

12:42.687 --> 12:44.219
And if these cupcakes
don't work,

12:44.221 --> 12:45.571
we'll tell her
you're Pakistani

12:45.573 --> 12:47.489
and let her go after it.

12:47.491 --> 12:50.492
Even if you do convince her
to give us the money,

12:50.494 --> 12:51.560
that's bitch money.

12:51.562 --> 12:53.162
We don't take bitch money.

12:53.164 --> 12:56.497
Max, you pick up pennies
off the pee corner.

12:57.284 --> 13:00.617
Not true.
Dimes and up.

13:03.907 --> 13:05.374
Hi!
We'll just be a second.

13:05.376 --> 13:07.242
- Oh, no. Oh, no.
- Cool hair, David Bowie.

13:07.244 --> 13:09.461
Okay, she's definitely
not seeing anyone today.

13:09.463 --> 13:11.046
Sorry to burst in,
Aunt Charity,

13:11.048 --> 13:14.381
but we wanted you to have
some of our cupcakes.

13:14.418 --> 13:15.801
[Both scream]

13:15.803 --> 13:18.920
It took two layers
to take off two years,

13:18.922 --> 13:20.689
but it was worth it.

13:20.691 --> 13:24.024
Just so you know,
the third layer is bone.

13:25.363 --> 13:28.080
Either I'm high,
or my chair melted.

13:28.082 --> 13:30.199
Okay, you're high.

13:30.201 --> 13:32.718
She's on morphine lollipops
for the pain.

13:32.720 --> 13:36.053
Really? 'Cause I'd like
to be on one for the fun.

13:37.357 --> 13:39.491
♪ I got that
boom boom boom ♪

13:39.493 --> 13:41.377
♪ I got that boom boom boom

13:41.379 --> 13:42.995
♪ I got that
boom boom boom ♪

13:42.997 --> 13:45.581
Okay, it's time
to change your face mask.

13:45.583 --> 13:47.416
You know what?
Let me do that.

13:47.418 --> 13:48.917
I can help
my aunt Charity.

13:48.919 --> 13:52.054
I'll do anything
to help someone in my family

13:52.056 --> 13:54.056
because families
help each other.

13:54.058 --> 13:55.290
Well, why don't you
help yourself

13:55.292 --> 13:58.625
to an adult-sized
pair of boobies?

13:59.580 --> 14:02.014
Like my boobs,
like my nose.

14:02.016 --> 14:04.400
Okay,
here's the new face mask.

14:04.402 --> 14:06.185
You peel the soiled one off,

14:06.187 --> 14:09.271
then swab the affected area
with Q-tips.

14:09.273 --> 14:10.489
And I left modeling

14:10.491 --> 14:13.824
because I thought it
was degrading.

14:14.844 --> 14:16.762
- Question, Stephanie.
- Yeah?

14:16.764 --> 14:18.030
Do these come
in orange, or lime,

14:18.032 --> 14:19.832
or is it just
the white flavor?

14:19.834 --> 14:20.750
Ah, screw it.

14:20.752 --> 14:23.819
After a couple of licks,
it won't matter.

14:23.821 --> 14:25.838
I'm happy to do this for you,
Aunt Charity,

14:25.840 --> 14:28.490
and not just for the money,
but 'cause we're family.

14:28.492 --> 14:30.826
I hate you.

14:30.828 --> 14:32.461
Always have.

14:32.463 --> 14:34.596
You can't mean that,
Aunt Charity.

14:34.598 --> 14:37.931
Up until you were born,
I was the family princess.

14:38.436 --> 14:41.386
And then you came in,
and you got the boom boom boom

14:41.388 --> 14:43.439
and you took
my boom boom boom.

14:43.441 --> 14:46.774
So I locked you
in a room room room.

14:47.361 --> 14:50.694
Well, I'm sorry you think
I took your boom boom boom,

14:51.232 --> 14:53.115
but you really did
take my seagull cup

14:53.117 --> 14:54.483
and lock me in a room.

14:54.485 --> 14:55.984
Room room.

14:55.986 --> 14:58.537
I'm not giving you any money,
little girl.

14:58.539 --> 14:59.905
Just so you know.

14:59.907 --> 15:02.023
Well,
maybe you'll feel differently

15:02.025 --> 15:04.326
after you taste
one of our cupcakes.

15:04.328 --> 15:06.528
Here, why don't we take
a minute for a little bite?

15:06.530 --> 15:08.297
Nope, I don't want it.

15:08.299 --> 15:10.365
It'll show you what a good
business investment we are.

15:10.367 --> 15:12.501
Here, come--come here.

15:12.503 --> 15:14.503
Just--oh--just taste it.

15:14.505 --> 15:15.654
Here.

15:15.656 --> 15:17.139
Come on, taste--
take a bite.

15:17.141 --> 15:19.141
This is pretty disturbing.

15:19.943 --> 15:23.476
I would intervene right now
if I wasn't feeling amazing.

15:24.682 --> 15:26.482
Yummy, right?

15:26.484 --> 15:27.900
Oh, no, no, no, no.

15:27.902 --> 15:29.184
No, no, no, that's your face.

15:29.186 --> 15:31.487
I think you're
chewing your face.

15:31.489 --> 15:34.822
That's the best cupcake
I have ever had,

15:35.659 --> 15:38.744
but I am still not
giving you any money.

15:38.746 --> 15:40.529
Why not?
It's the least you could do

15:40.531 --> 15:42.230
after you broke
my seagull cup.

15:42.232 --> 15:45.367
Oh, my God, are you still
talking about that seagull cup?

15:45.369 --> 15:48.086
I haven't thought
about that in 15 years.

15:48.088 --> 15:50.789
If we're gonna be talking
about that stupid seagull cup,

15:50.791 --> 15:53.709
I'm gonna need
another lollipop.

15:53.711 --> 15:56.879
Where does she keep them?

15:56.881 --> 15:59.748
Oh, here, they're in this cup
that has a seagull on it.

15:59.750 --> 16:02.768
Wait.

16:02.770 --> 16:05.971
Where have I
heard of seagull cup before?

16:06.673 --> 16:09.107
That's my
night-night cocoa cup.

16:09.109 --> 16:10.726
I knew it wasn't broken.

16:10.728 --> 16:12.928
You hid it and kept it
all these years?

16:12.930 --> 16:14.530
Yep.

16:14.532 --> 16:16.765
Why would you want
to hurt me like that?

16:16.767 --> 16:18.400
It's obvious.

16:18.402 --> 16:20.035
She's obsessed
with her brother,

16:20.037 --> 16:21.370
and she saw your being born

16:21.372 --> 16:23.956
as his love being
taken away from her.

16:23.958 --> 16:27.291
Damn, this thing
makes me smart.

16:27.545 --> 16:29.244
Well,
I hope you're happy now,

16:29.246 --> 16:31.947
because I lost a lot more
than my night-night cocoa cup.

16:31.949 --> 16:33.332
I lost my money, my father,

16:33.334 --> 16:34.967
and now I'm about
to lose my dream.

16:34.969 --> 16:36.718
And you know what?
We're done.

16:36.720 --> 16:38.554
You know what?
We are not done.

16:38.556 --> 16:39.888
I am not a quitter.

16:39.890 --> 16:41.924
I said I would
put your new face on,

16:41.926 --> 16:45.259
so I'm not leaving here
until I do.

16:46.230 --> 16:48.230
Her face is gone.

16:48.232 --> 16:51.565
She's basically
the Phantom of the Channing.

16:54.737 --> 16:58.070
All right,
that's close enough.

16:59.109 --> 17:00.826
And stop calling me spoiled.

17:00.828 --> 17:02.828
Since I lost it all,
I've worked hard.

17:02.830 --> 17:04.829
I've cleaned toilets,
I've killed rats,

17:04.832 --> 17:07.281
I've done everything
I had to to be a success.

17:07.284 --> 17:08.467
Tell her, Max.

17:08.469 --> 17:10.202
♪ I got that
boom boom boom ♪

17:10.204 --> 17:12.337
- ♪ I got that boom--
- Okay, fine. Let's go.

17:12.339 --> 17:13.704
Stop.

17:14.207 --> 17:16.124
Fine, I'll give you
the money.

17:16.126 --> 17:19.459
Not--not just because
you're my niece,

17:21.298 --> 17:23.598
but because you
forced yourself in here

17:23.601 --> 17:26.518
like a pushy businesswoman,
which is--

17:26.520 --> 17:29.805
you shoved your cupcake
down my throat.

17:30.307 --> 17:33.140
That is exactly
what I would have done.

17:35.511 --> 17:37.729
25,000,

17:37.731 --> 17:41.064
signed Char-ity Chan...

17:43.537 --> 17:45.070
Oh, no.

17:45.072 --> 17:47.789
Aunt Charity,
are you all right?

17:47.791 --> 17:50.459
Oh, and she didn't
finish signing it.

17:50.461 --> 17:53.528
Well, it's my last name too,
so...

17:53.530 --> 17:56.581
...ing.

17:56.583 --> 17:58.467
I can't get it out
from under her head.

17:58.469 --> 18:01.802
Pull her hair!
Now's your chance.

18:02.873 --> 18:06.058
Ow.

18:10.596 --> 18:12.848
Bob, I don't feel
you are getting across

18:12.850 --> 18:15.150
my passion about this,
so I'll just sign it.

18:15.152 --> 18:18.020
That check
should have cleared.

18:18.022 --> 18:21.355
That time, you said,
"Your face looks like a butt."

18:22.742 --> 18:25.575
I appreciate how hard you've
tried to stay in business,

18:25.746 --> 18:27.029
but do the smart thing.

18:27.031 --> 18:29.448
Take the money.
Start fresh.

18:29.450 --> 18:32.334
All you have to do
is sign this.

18:32.336 --> 18:33.669
Well,
we will have to discuss it.

18:33.671 --> 18:35.236
- My partner has a be--
- Just sign it.

18:35.238 --> 18:38.571
Good discussion.

18:39.242 --> 18:42.511
Caroline Chan--

18:42.513 --> 18:44.746
Max, a little help.

18:44.748 --> 18:47.766
...ing.

18:47.768 --> 18:49.384
So, as of this moment,

18:49.386 --> 18:52.137
this space is no longer
Max's Homemade Cupcakes.

18:52.139 --> 18:55.472
Congratulations
and good luck.

18:56.610 --> 18:59.943
Well, there goes Joanne
and that deaf lady.

We are keeping the arrow.

19:07.071 --> 19:10.404
I can't believe my aunt would
stop payment on that check.

19:10.708 --> 19:14.041
And I can't believe she'd
show up here after she did.

19:16.763 --> 19:18.330
Aunt Charity,
do you know

19:18.332 --> 19:20.115
what I'm thinking
about you right now?

19:20.117 --> 19:23.450
What? I look 38 or 39,
it's hard to tell?

19:24.470 --> 19:26.171
Oh, don't look so wounded.

19:26.173 --> 19:27.806
You know I had
to stop that check.

19:27.808 --> 19:30.425
You took advantage of someone
in a morphine haze.

19:30.427 --> 19:32.561
If you think that
was being taken advantage of,

19:32.563 --> 19:35.597
you've never blacked out
at a pep rally.

19:35.599 --> 19:38.133
Yes, I stopped that check,
but here.

19:38.135 --> 19:40.068
This seems important to you.

19:40.070 --> 19:41.486
Seemed.

19:41.488 --> 19:43.438
Seemed when I was rich.

19:43.440 --> 19:45.157
Now I have real problems.

19:45.159 --> 19:48.076
Yeah, and where
are them lollipops at?

19:48.478 --> 19:51.411
- You took away my future.
- And my lollipops.

19:52.532 --> 19:55.000
No, Caroline,
I took away my money.

19:55.002 --> 19:56.785
And by forcing you
to find you own way,

19:56.787 --> 19:58.837
I may have given you
a better future.

19:59.139 --> 20:02.172
Cute shop.
Too big, too soon.

20:02.176 --> 20:04.509
You'll figure it out.

20:05.846 --> 20:08.163
Aunt Charity?

20:08.465 --> 20:11.498
You look 42.

20:12.335 --> 20:14.668
We all know I don't.

20:18.307 --> 20:20.058
The shop's over.

20:20.060 --> 20:23.178
Wow, I thought for sure
we'd be a success.

20:24.180 --> 20:25.814
Well,
who says we're not?

20:25.816 --> 20:27.649
I mean,
we had some fun, right?

20:27.651 --> 20:30.984
And we have
a cool-ass red arrow.

20:31.155 --> 20:32.454
And we have this big check,

20:32.456 --> 20:33.989
which is just enough
to pay back Sophie

20:33.991 --> 20:36.324
and everybody else
we owe money to.

20:36.326 --> 20:37.642
That's true.

20:37.644 --> 20:39.461
So in a way,
we're kind of success.

20:39.463 --> 20:42.247
I mean, we did go
from broke to broke even.

20:42.249 --> 20:43.799
We nailed it.

20:44.801 --> 20:46.835
I just wish we
had a clear-cut sign

20:46.837 --> 20:49.370
that letting go of this place
was the right thing to do.

You wanted a sign?
That's your sign!

you'll be okay.
