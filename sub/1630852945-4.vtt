00:05.922 --> 00:07.954
Hey, Reed, Grady had agreed
to cut the prices down.

00:08.085 --> 00:09.639
I'm hoping you can honor that.

00:09.724 --> 00:11.357
Let's keep it at ten for now.

00:11.484 --> 00:13.017
You talk to Teddy?

00:13.119 --> 00:14.537
He said the prices
ain't changing

00:14.622 --> 00:15.922
'cause the prices
ain't the problem.

00:16.006 --> 00:17.072
- Know what is?
- Hmm?

00:17.450 --> 00:18.483
Y'all two.

00:18.593 --> 00:20.085
I see.

00:20.170 --> 00:22.421
So you just gonna bend over
and do whatever he say?

00:22.506 --> 00:23.968
Well, I hate to break it to you,

00:24.055 --> 00:26.713
but everybody's got to
answer to somebody. And me?

00:26.798 --> 00:29.332
I answer to the man who may have
disappeared my fucking father.

00:30.257 --> 00:32.075
I need something to
give to my bosses.

00:32.177 --> 00:34.614
I ain't no snitch, Beau.

00:34.699 --> 00:36.532
This is about self-preservation.

00:36.617 --> 00:39.622
So, unless you want to go back
to not having my protection,

00:39.707 --> 00:42.408
I suggest you find
somebody to serve up.

00:43.857 --> 00:45.724
Gonna miss you.

00:47.661 --> 00:49.160
So much.

00:53.066 --> 00:56.219
<i>The minute your
parents touched down in Cuba,</i>

00:56.304 --> 00:58.538
<i>they would have been
targeted by any number</i>

00:58.623 --> 01:00.423
<i>of intelligence agencies.</i>

01:01.358 --> 01:05.294
<i>I'm talking about
the dgi, the kgb.</i>

01:05.605 --> 01:08.639
<i>The truth is, I have no idea
what's happened to Alton.</i>

01:09.250 --> 01:12.110
I swear to you, whatever
happened to your father,

01:12.195 --> 01:14.445
I had nothing to do with it.

01:14.648 --> 01:16.187
<i>Mom, we gonna have a baby.</i>

01:17.346 --> 01:19.213
Sure wish you was here.

01:48.894 --> 01:50.327
Hello?

01:52.907 --> 01:54.574
Anyone here?

02:19.376 --> 02:21.176
<i>What do you think?</i>

02:21.261 --> 02:22.761
<i>It's okay.</i>

02:22.846 --> 02:25.313
Yo, man, do you know,
when I was your age,

02:25.398 --> 02:27.999
I slept in the same
room with two brothers.

02:28.101 --> 02:29.500
Say, Franklin...

02:35.008 --> 02:38.376
<i>Cissy, this is about our future.</i>

02:38.478 --> 02:40.745
No more drugs.

02:40.847 --> 02:42.913
No more violence. Just us.

02:52.058 --> 02:54.109
<i>We can stop</i>

02:54.230 --> 02:56.064
<i>all of this.</i>

02:56.463 --> 02:59.497
I want him to walk away.

03:05.038 --> 03:07.805
<i>I just want you
to know that what I did.</i>

03:09.709 --> 03:12.410
<i>I did for all of us.</i>

03:13.413 --> 03:14.945
<i>I love you.</i>

03:29.945 --> 03:31.688
We're gonna
need a bigger trunk.

03:31.798 --> 03:33.464
Shit, we need more cars.

03:33.566 --> 03:35.533
More cars means more
car carriers, nigga.

03:35.635 --> 03:37.101
Means another driver.

03:37.203 --> 03:39.203
No, you just got to
open the panels up.

03:40.109 --> 03:41.555

motherfuckers in there

03:41.640 --> 03:43.899

your mama's pussy last night.

03:43.984 --> 03:45.977

Haven't really figured
out my prices yet.

05:27.780 --> 05:30.147
You think we came down here
to pay you to snitch on us?

05:30.249 --> 05:32.650
Based on
the tape capacity,

05:32.752 --> 05:34.585
that's about 15
hours of snitching.

05:34.687 --> 05:36.094
Snitching or observing the hood?

05:36.179 --> 05:37.641
- I mean...
- Motherfucker, how about putting

05:37.725 --> 05:39.565
our motherfucking business
out on front street?

05:40.679 --> 05:42.066
Hey.

05:42.192 --> 05:44.016
Put the tapes in the bag, man.

05:44.101 --> 05:45.229
A-all right. Hold up.

05:45.331 --> 05:46.690
- Wait, wait. Let me just...
- Every one of 'em.

05:46.774 --> 05:48.351
Let me just keep these.

05:48.461 --> 05:50.294
I don't be writing
this shit down.

05:50.872 --> 05:52.705
It's all in your head?

05:54.507 --> 05:55.688
Cool.

05:55.897 --> 05:58.192
So, if we ever need to
get rid of the evidence,

05:58.607 --> 06:00.574
all we got to do...

06:01.590 --> 06:04.057
So, y'all just gonna
kill my whole album?

06:04.516 --> 06:07.451
- This my life right here.
- Is it, motherfucker?

06:09.088 --> 06:10.520
How long you been rapping?

06:10.622 --> 06:12.322
Slid out my mama rhyming.

06:16.503 --> 06:19.594
Poetry my first love. I
just put her on a beat.

06:19.679 --> 06:21.898
- Spit something right now.
- I'm an artist.

06:22.000 --> 06:23.366
I got to be motivated.

06:23.469 --> 06:24.760
- Nigga, I will...
- One time! One time!

06:24.844 --> 06:27.745
One time!.

06:36.610 --> 06:38.148
He's a fucking kid.

06:38.828 --> 06:41.195
He's a fucking kid.
Call the dog off.

06:46.481 --> 06:48.676
- Lapd!
- LAPD!

06:52.593 --> 06:54.601
Good boy. Here.

07:02.369 --> 07:04.236
Stupid motherfucker.

07:22.094 --> 07:24.142
- You don't want that.
- Really?

07:24.227 --> 07:25.867
- Yeah, you don't want it.
- Are you sure?

07:25.970 --> 07:27.636
It's not even the right size.

07:27.739 --> 07:29.839
Did chivalry die when I moved in

07:29.941 --> 07:31.607
or when I decided
to have the baby?

07:31.709 --> 07:33.509
Is this a "why buy the cow,"

07:33.611 --> 07:35.195
"milk for free"
situation? I want to know.

07:35.279 --> 07:37.847
You know what? I was actually
gonna say the same thing.

07:37.949 --> 07:39.066
- Were you?
- Yeah, so, you know,

07:39.150 --> 07:40.434
- before you moved in here...
- Mm-hmm.

07:40.518 --> 07:42.403
You used to come up in
here cooking up a storm.

07:42.487 --> 07:44.620
Breakfast, lunch, dinner.

07:44.722 --> 07:46.555
Waking up to cheese,
eggs and grits.

07:46.657 --> 07:48.424
Used to pack me a little
lunch to the side.

07:48.526 --> 07:50.326
Used to come home
to baked chicken,

07:50.428 --> 07:52.379
- macaroni and cheese...
- Oh, you're really about to go there, huh?

07:52.463 --> 07:54.415
Grits. Oh, I'm-a go there,
but, wait, let me finish.

07:54.499 --> 07:56.565
- Uh-huh. Mm-hmm.
- As soon as you got the keys,

07:56.667 --> 07:57.785
and you're in, all of a sudden,

07:57.869 --> 08:00.102
the kitchen's all
clean and unused.

08:00.204 --> 08:01.755
I'm over here losing weight.

08:01.839 --> 08:03.324
- Losing....
- Look at that. Touch it.

08:03.408 --> 08:05.241
Look at that.

08:05.343 --> 08:07.761
- See that?
- Ooh, objection. Relevance to the previous argument.

08:07.845 --> 08:09.311
Overruled.

08:09.414 --> 08:12.748
- Overruled?
- So, seeing as I got bamboozled,

08:12.850 --> 08:14.350
I'm-a get that last egg roll.

08:14.452 --> 08:15.718
Okay?

08:18.990 --> 08:21.257
You really miss me cooking?

08:21.359 --> 08:23.426
- Hell yeah.
- Hmm.

08:26.064 --> 08:27.863
Mm...

08:27.965 --> 08:29.899
And now a nigga can't even get

08:30.001 --> 08:31.919
a peanut butter, jelly
sandwich in this motherfucker.

08:36.908 --> 08:38.741
'sup?

08:41.245 --> 08:43.145

an outside line.

Yeah, five minutes.

08:48.786 --> 08:49.919

08:50.021 --> 08:52.388
Projects got raided.

08:58.062 --> 08:59.929

12:23.366 --> 12:25.332
All right, let's have it.

12:25.420 --> 12:27.105
You don't think I got a
right to be pissed off?

12:27.189 --> 12:28.922
Think you should be
glad it wasn't worse.

12:29.024 --> 12:32.225
Worse than siccing dogs
on your own people?

12:32.327 --> 12:34.928
Since when the fuck
are they my people?

12:35.030 --> 12:36.963
They the same motherfuckers

12:37.065 --> 12:38.898
been calling me
redbone my entire life.

12:39.001 --> 12:41.001
All right, siccing them
on my people, then.

12:41.103 --> 12:43.803
What you think this is?

12:43.905 --> 12:45.899
What, you throw a
little cocaine my way,

12:45.984 --> 12:47.714
sit a girl in my
lap, bat your eyes,

12:47.809 --> 12:49.661
and I'm supposed to do
whatever the fuck you want?

12:49.745 --> 12:51.678
I told you I was
gonna find somebody.

12:51.779 --> 12:53.498
And I bet I won't have
to ask twice next time.

12:53.582 --> 12:54.984
Now, are we done?

12:55.306 --> 12:58.107
Hmm. I need to know that
there is trust here.

12:58.201 --> 13:00.368
That you not gonna just fuck me

13:00.453 --> 13:02.487
any time you feel like it.

13:02.589 --> 13:04.312
You do what I ask,

13:04.397 --> 13:05.930
you'll be fine.

13:08.559 --> 13:10.326
Have a good night, lo...

13:23.168 --> 13:24.734
Sorry, buddy.

13:24.844 --> 13:27.278
They told me they fixed the
traffic while I was gone,

13:27.363 --> 13:28.414
but...

13:28.538 --> 13:29.737
Look,

13:29.822 --> 13:32.389
projects got hit yesterday.

13:32.474 --> 13:34.274
Leon and his folks.

13:35.211 --> 13:36.878
Okay.

13:36.963 --> 13:38.367
They've gotten worse, man,

13:38.445 --> 13:40.679
since you've been gone. LAPD.

13:40.781 --> 13:42.298
Even in the last few months.

13:42.383 --> 13:44.703
And the crackdown on my people's
been pretty fucking brutal.

13:44.787 --> 13:46.553
Yeah, I mean,

13:46.638 --> 13:48.972
you're moving literal
tons of rock cocaine.

13:49.057 --> 13:50.356
What'd you expect?

13:50.441 --> 13:51.893
Considering I'm moving
those tons of cocaine

13:51.977 --> 13:54.030
on behalf of what I thought
was a grateful fucking nation,

13:54.114 --> 13:55.989
I'm expecting a
little help, please.

13:56.074 --> 13:58.375
Okay, so you asked me
here to help get the

13:58.460 --> 14:01.226
Los Angeles police department
to go easy on your people?

14:01.311 --> 14:03.711
Well, you had contacts at
the LAPD before, right?

14:03.796 --> 14:05.001
Well, I don't anymore.

14:05.086 --> 14:07.123
Why? Why not? What happened?

14:07.208 --> 14:08.593
Are you kidding me? Why not?

14:08.678 --> 14:11.345
Your fucking father
went to the press.

14:12.212 --> 14:13.578
Remember?

14:13.803 --> 14:16.199
So now my people are more
wary than ever about exposure.

14:16.284 --> 14:17.802
That's why they sent
a goddamn contractor

14:17.886 --> 14:19.820
- in here after I left.
- Okay.

14:23.203 --> 14:25.054
This is bullshit.

14:26.271 --> 14:28.438
They're not coming after
you, right? These cops?

14:28.523 --> 14:29.789
Just your people on the street?

14:29.892 --> 14:31.281
Yeah, but...

14:31.366 --> 14:34.100
So, my advice, don't
worry about it.

14:35.420 --> 14:38.154
'Cause, yeah, crash
is a scary name.

14:38.515 --> 14:40.140
Sure, at the end of the day,

14:40.219 --> 14:42.968
these cops pose no threat
to you at all. You know why?

14:43.500 --> 14:44.978
'Cause in the grand
scheme of things,

14:45.063 --> 14:47.931
nobody fucking cares what
happens in south central.

14:49.325 --> 14:50.744
Yeah, if it was a
white neighborhood,

14:50.828 --> 14:51.570
you could be worried.

14:51.655 --> 14:54.148
They'd send the fucking
national guard in here, right?

14:55.074 --> 14:57.641
Just...

14:57.876 --> 15:00.277
Keep yourself insular.

15:00.379 --> 15:03.180
Only deal with your family.

15:03.556 --> 15:05.055
They can never touch you.

15:12.933 --> 15:14.430
Avoid the 110 on your way out.

15:14.515 --> 15:15.909
Yeah.

15:15.994 --> 15:18.795
'Cause it's a
fucking parking lot.

15:22.734 --> 15:25.702
. <i>Swing and a miss. Strike one.</i>

15:25.914 --> 15:30.507
<i>.318 batter, 39
homers and 139 rbis...</i>

15:31.512 --> 15:33.745
Mr. Simmons.

15:38.973 --> 15:40.572
Welcome to Chinatown.

15:40.752 --> 15:44.154
Funny place to start
following america's pastime.

15:44.256 --> 15:45.789
You like baseball?

15:45.891 --> 15:48.525
America's got a lot of
pastimes I ain't too fond of.

15:49.862 --> 15:51.928
Okay.

15:52.030 --> 15:54.698
Look, I need some
specialty items.

15:54.800 --> 15:57.234
Some rocket launchers,
armor-piercing rounds,

15:57.336 --> 15:58.735
anything to fuck some shit up.

15:58.837 --> 16:02.105
Might I inquire as to why

16:02.207 --> 16:05.509
you're in need of
such lethal devices?

16:05.611 --> 16:08.178
The other boys in blue.

16:08.452 --> 16:11.632
You plan to declare
war on the police?

16:14.567 --> 16:17.735
On oppression, on tyranny.

16:18.091 --> 16:20.095
But I didn't think I had to
come and explain that to you.

16:20.179 --> 16:22.092
It's true.

16:22.194 --> 16:25.529
I've witnessed a few
uprising in my lifetime,

16:25.631 --> 16:27.697
some more successful
than others.

16:27.799 --> 16:31.034
So you'll believe me when I'll
tell you that the conditions

16:31.136 --> 16:34.404
do not exist... In or
out of the projects...

16:34.506 --> 16:36.373
To successfully lead

16:36.475 --> 16:39.709
that proletarian insurgency
that you're dreaming about.

16:39.811 --> 16:41.578
Hmm. Well, I guess that depends

16:41.680 --> 16:43.480
on how you define
success, right?

16:44.950 --> 16:47.250
Seem...
Seems like surviving

16:47.352 --> 16:49.119
would be a good idea.

16:49.221 --> 16:51.788
If I get at least one of
them pigs before they get me,

16:51.890 --> 16:53.256
I figure that's a win.

16:53.358 --> 16:56.326
And what hell do you think
will visit upon your people

16:56.428 --> 16:57.627
if you killed one of theirs?

16:57.729 --> 16:59.095
I mean, it can't be any worse

16:59.197 --> 17:00.348
than what they're
doing right now.

17:00.432 --> 17:01.898
Oh, really?

17:02.000 --> 17:05.635
Much worse, boychik.

17:05.737 --> 17:08.305
Look, I got money, you got guns.

17:08.406 --> 17:09.940
Now, you gonna
give me this shit,

17:10.041 --> 17:11.875
or do I have to
go somewhere else?

17:13.178 --> 17:14.778
Just give me a few days.

17:14.880 --> 17:16.780
As you said,

17:16.882 --> 17:19.182
these are specialty items.

17:19.284 --> 17:21.117
Call me when you got 'em.

17:21.219 --> 17:22.819
Sure thing.

17:26.692 --> 17:28.491
Mr. Owens in 4a,

17:28.594 --> 17:30.794
he said he wouldn't pay
until his toilet got fixed.

17:30.896 --> 17:32.981
I thought he was just talking
shit, told him to show me,

17:33.065 --> 17:34.397
but he wasn't lying.

17:34.499 --> 17:35.999
So I went down to
the hardware store,

17:36.101 --> 17:38.368
bought a $8 snake,
fixed it myself.

17:39.404 --> 17:41.738
Thing is, I used some
of the rent money

17:41.840 --> 17:44.074
I already collected
to buy the snake.

17:44.176 --> 17:45.976
- That okay?
- Of course.

17:47.412 --> 17:48.945
Mrs. Saint.

17:50.549 --> 17:51.648
Mama.

17:51.750 --> 17:53.950
Welcome to the
westside development.

17:54.052 --> 17:56.553
My god..

17:56.655 --> 17:58.321
- You look nice.
- Thank you, darling.

17:59.791 --> 18:02.092
It's good to be here.

18:03.895 --> 18:04.995
Hello.

18:05.097 --> 18:07.631
Oh, yeah. I want you
to meet Wanda bell.

18:07.733 --> 18:10.233
- Hi, Mrs. Saint.
- Ah. So you're the one

18:10.335 --> 18:12.869
- who's been staying in my home.
- I'm so sorry about the mess.

18:12.971 --> 18:15.705
I would've cleaned up if I'd
known you was coming, but...

18:15.807 --> 18:17.841
Didn't nobody tell me.

18:19.778 --> 18:23.179
It's fine. I hope it's
been a safe space for you.

18:27.786 --> 18:30.820
I'm... Gonna go get to work.

18:30.922 --> 18:32.789
So nice to meet you.

18:36.161 --> 18:37.994
Uh, so what you think?

18:39.831 --> 18:42.832
It is... Better than
I could've imagined.

18:42.934 --> 18:45.035
I am so proud of you.

18:45.137 --> 18:46.736
Of both of you.

18:46.838 --> 18:49.339
We're just expanding on
the foundation you laid.

18:49.441 --> 18:51.808
Well, Franklin's
lucky to have found you.

18:51.910 --> 18:55.745
I left him with a heavy burden,
managing all of this on his own.

18:55.847 --> 18:59.516
He is one of the most
capable men I've ever met.

18:59.618 --> 19:01.851
Just like his father.

19:01.953 --> 19:03.371
All right, mama. Come on..

19:03.455 --> 19:05.388
- Take a seat.
- Okay.

19:05.490 --> 19:06.908
So, we gonna walk you
through everything.

19:06.992 --> 19:08.892
There you go.

19:08.994 --> 19:10.794
All right.

19:10.896 --> 19:12.829
Including the downtown project.

19:13.832 --> 19:15.565
Okay.

19:15.667 --> 19:18.134
Mrs. Saint, the first
space that we're gonna have,

19:18.236 --> 19:19.903
it's warehouse flex, right?

19:20.005 --> 19:21.489
We're real excited
about where it's located

19:21.573 --> 19:22.991
and all the options
that it gives us.

19:23.075 --> 19:25.408
It gives us a lot of
opportunities for, you know,

19:25.510 --> 19:27.043
growth.

19:29.047 --> 19:31.548
<i>- I am.
- All right.</i>

19:31.650 --> 19:33.783
<i>I went to visit my
college roommate,</i>

19:33.885 --> 19:35.852
<i>and somehow Alice
had heard about it.</i>

19:35.954 --> 19:39.189
<i>I-I didn't invite her.
She just showed up.</i>

19:39.291 --> 19:41.424
Franklin called.

19:41.526 --> 19:44.761
Hosting a family dinner, in
honor of Cissy being back.

19:44.863 --> 19:47.630
Hmm. That sound nice.
What time you heading out?

19:47.733 --> 19:50.266
. You being funny?

19:50.368 --> 19:53.303
How about me, you,

19:53.405 --> 19:55.138
we take her to dinner
on another night?

19:55.240 --> 19:57.440
You know I don't like you
putting me in the middle

19:57.542 --> 20:00.276
of your... Franklin and
you little beef you got.

20:00.378 --> 20:02.545
You need to patch that shit up.

20:03.915 --> 20:05.448
I hear that.

20:05.550 --> 20:07.851
I know there's some
static between us,

20:07.953 --> 20:09.652
but this...

20:09.755 --> 20:12.055
This is not about Franklin.

20:13.959 --> 20:15.492
Then what is it?

20:15.594 --> 20:17.861
I'm just exhausted.

20:17.963 --> 20:19.863
It's been one thing

20:19.965 --> 20:22.599
after another after another
after... Ugh, and I just want to

20:22.701 --> 20:25.001
sit here in this chair

20:25.103 --> 20:27.637
and watch these white bitches
fight over stupid shit.

20:27.739 --> 20:30.306
Nah. Nah-ah-ah.

20:30.408 --> 20:31.641
Mm-mm.

20:33.078 --> 20:35.512
I ain't going to accept that.

20:35.614 --> 20:38.615
There's a lot of shit
going on right now.

20:38.717 --> 20:42.152
Skully cutting off niggas' ears.

20:42.254 --> 20:45.054
The cops got Einstein
all fucked up.

20:46.725 --> 20:48.825
And my nephew

20:48.927 --> 20:50.794
wants to throw a dinner

20:50.896 --> 20:53.963
for my sister that I
ain't seen in over a year,

20:54.065 --> 20:55.732
bringing the family together.

20:57.602 --> 21:00.303
And you won't do
that shit for me?

21:03.975 --> 21:05.675
You're right.

21:08.814 --> 21:10.280
I'm sorry.

21:12.184 --> 21:15.051
You want me there, I am there..

21:15.153 --> 21:17.086
Yeah.

21:17.189 --> 21:20.223
Sorry about that, man.

21:20.325 --> 21:22.592
Want you to know I
meant what I said.

21:22.694 --> 21:24.527
Anything you need down here,

21:24.629 --> 21:26.663
all you got to do is ask.

21:26.765 --> 21:28.097
All right.

21:28.200 --> 21:30.200
That's it?

21:30.302 --> 21:32.836
No, actually, um...

21:32.938 --> 21:36.139
Having a little get-together
for moms tonight.

21:36.241 --> 21:38.508
Mean a lot if you came through.

21:38.610 --> 21:42.312
I'll never forget what your
moms did for me, but I can't.

21:43.748 --> 21:46.015
Look, I know you been
through it down here.

21:46.117 --> 21:48.251
I know.

21:48.353 --> 21:51.354
But this is about
family, you know.

21:51.456 --> 21:53.423
Nothing more important.

21:53.525 --> 21:56.326
Look, I'm not sure if
that's true for me anymore.

21:56.428 --> 21:59.596
Or maybe it's just
that, right now,

21:59.698 --> 22:02.565
my people need me more.

22:02.667 --> 22:04.434
What you mean?

22:04.536 --> 22:06.469
Folks here in the projects?

22:06.571 --> 22:08.071
I mean black folks everywhere.

22:08.173 --> 22:09.957
We making all this money,
supposed to have some power

22:10.041 --> 22:11.774
with this shit, and
what are we doing?

22:11.877 --> 22:13.728
Instead of lifting them up,
we putting them in position

22:13.812 --> 22:16.212
to either get hurt, fall to
the pipe or get arrested.

22:16.314 --> 22:19.883
Look, I understand you want
to help your people, I get it,

22:19.985 --> 22:23.386
but you could do that and
show up for me tonight, okay?

22:23.488 --> 22:26.990
Sorry, Saint, but I can't
sit up there celebrating,

22:27.092 --> 22:29.459
eating steak and shit while my
folks out here getting hurt.

22:31.529 --> 22:33.563
Give your moms my best.

22:51.500 --> 22:53.023
<i>Hey, here we go.</i>

22:53.108 --> 22:54.767
I took the Liberty
to start us off

22:54.852 --> 22:56.752
with a little taste of Cuba.

22:56.839 --> 22:58.367
- Ah.
- All right.

22:58.452 --> 23:01.218
Mojitos from a
Japanese restaurant?

23:01.337 --> 23:04.137
Jerome, you order Sushi
from Lucy's on pico, too?

23:07.183 --> 23:11.018
Okay, I had my mouth open
for that one. All right.

23:11.120 --> 23:13.071
- That's my lady right there.
- Here you go, give me...

23:13.155 --> 23:16.570
- Oh, my goodness.
- Go on, try that, try that. Try that.

23:16.655 --> 23:18.322
Oh, brother, I can't hang.

23:18.504 --> 23:20.871
Keeps me up at night.
Can't do it no more, man.

23:20.956 --> 23:23.190
What?.

23:23.466 --> 23:24.965
Where's
Leon? Is he coming?

23:25.067 --> 23:26.767
He apologizes.

23:26.869 --> 23:28.703
He wanted to be here, but...

23:28.788 --> 23:32.022
He's got a lot on his mind after
what happened in the projects.

23:32.541 --> 23:33.774
Okay.

23:34.810 --> 23:37.328
Hey.

23:39.181 --> 23:42.449
- Yeah.
- Um, this right here,

23:42.551 --> 23:44.551
this is what it's
all about, you know?

23:44.654 --> 23:45.953
Family.

23:46.055 --> 23:49.123
Wouldn't be here tonight if
it wasn't for moms, so...

23:49.225 --> 23:52.126
- Oh...
- Cissy Saint, you built this house.

23:52.228 --> 23:54.194
Welcome home, mama.

23:54.297 --> 23:55.696
To Cissy.

23:55.798 --> 23:58.098
- To Cissy.
- I love y'all.

23:58.200 --> 24:00.934
- I love y'all. I really have missed you.
- Mm-mm.

24:01.037 --> 24:02.936
- Aw. Thank you.
- All right, now.

24:03.039 --> 24:04.471
We got to talk about these two.

24:04.573 --> 24:06.707
Yes, let's talk
about these two, please.

24:06.809 --> 24:08.842
Keeping up
the family tradition,

24:08.944 --> 24:11.812
bringing another generation.

24:11.914 --> 24:13.947
Are we gonna talk
about marriage?

24:14.050 --> 24:16.483
Has somebody said something
about marriage? Can we, please?

24:16.585 --> 24:18.986
You know, we discussed it,
but she just moved in and...

24:19.088 --> 24:22.489
You know, we got this
baby to think about, so...

24:22.591 --> 24:24.858
We gonna take a
beat on the wedding.

24:24.960 --> 24:27.594
My little
nephew a goddamn daddy!

24:27.697 --> 24:29.763
How the fuck that happen?

24:29.865 --> 24:31.316
You really need me to
explain it to you, unc?

24:34.870 --> 24:37.204
Is that why you came
back? For the baby?

24:41.544 --> 24:43.944
I guess it was the
push that I needed.

24:45.348 --> 24:48.182
And truth be told,
there wasn't...

24:48.284 --> 24:51.819
Anything for me
back there, so...

24:51.921 --> 24:53.954
It was time to come home.

24:59.628 --> 25:01.528
Everyone, ready to order?

25:01.630 --> 25:04.164
Yeah. Let's eat.

25:08.771 --> 25:10.871
You better
than the hood.

25:10.973 --> 25:13.907
All this money..

25:14.009 --> 25:16.076
And now you gonna
be up all night.

25:16.178 --> 25:18.879
Mm-mm, it's mostly
watered down anyway.

25:21.083 --> 25:23.717
- Alton would have loved this.
- Oh, yeah.

25:23.819 --> 25:26.086
- Dinner with the family.
- Mm-hmm.

25:26.188 --> 25:29.256
Knowing he's going
to be a grandfather.

25:29.358 --> 25:32.493
Jerome tell you
they got a horse?

25:32.595 --> 25:34.212
Oh, my god.

25:38.167 --> 25:40.534
You ever find out
what happened to him?

25:40.636 --> 25:42.603
Alton?

25:44.240 --> 25:46.473
You know, we don't have to
talk about that right now.

25:46.575 --> 25:48.242
Never officially, no.

25:48.344 --> 25:50.677
But we all know what happened.

25:54.450 --> 25:58.786
Teddy McDonald killed him.

26:02.525 --> 26:04.591
You know, we can't say
that without proof.

26:04.693 --> 26:06.860
Franklin...

26:06.962 --> 26:10.597
Hey.
Ex-panther in Cuba?

26:11.634 --> 26:13.200
It's no amount of
people that might have

26:13.302 --> 26:14.902
been interested in him.

26:15.004 --> 26:16.937
To wipe him off the
face of the earth,

26:17.039 --> 26:18.705
only one man wanted that.

26:25.581 --> 26:27.448
What's going on
between the two of you?

26:27.550 --> 26:31.251
Y'all been kicking each other
under the table all night.

26:31.353 --> 26:33.454
What's going on?

26:33.556 --> 26:35.055
It's nothing. Forget about it.

26:35.157 --> 26:37.257
It's fine. Huh?

26:37.359 --> 26:39.644
- Come on, let's finish dinner.
- What do y'all know that I don't?

26:45.367 --> 26:47.367
She deserves to know.

26:49.805 --> 26:51.505
Franklin?

26:55.244 --> 26:56.577
Teddy's back.

27:11.260 --> 27:13.527
I want to be
there for you, Franklin.

27:14.930 --> 27:17.631
But I realize now that
I can't fully do that

27:17.733 --> 27:20.100
if you keep me in the dark.

27:21.270 --> 27:22.836
I'm talking about the business.

27:22.938 --> 27:24.523
Mrs. Saint, it's an open book.

27:24.607 --> 27:26.139
Just ask, and I'll walk you...

27:26.242 --> 27:27.841
Not that business, baby.

27:30.045 --> 27:31.945
You want in on the game?

27:32.047 --> 27:33.146
I've been in.

27:33.249 --> 27:35.782
I lost my husband because of it.

27:35.885 --> 27:38.285
And now the man responsible
is back in our lives.

27:38.387 --> 27:40.187
Even if that's true,
how does you being

27:40.289 --> 27:42.489
back in the game
make things better?

27:46.128 --> 27:48.028
When I first walked
into the club

27:48.130 --> 27:50.964
and saw veronique
standing there,

27:51.066 --> 27:54.134
I knew you had found
the right woman.

27:54.236 --> 27:56.069
You know why?

27:57.072 --> 27:59.306
'Cause she was there.

27:59.408 --> 28:01.448
Someone you could trust
with that part of your life.

28:01.544 --> 28:02.943
Someone you didn't
have to lie to.

28:03.045 --> 28:04.943
I don't take her
on drops with me.

28:05.028 --> 28:08.763
But she knows about
Teddy. Don't you?

28:11.053 --> 28:12.853
I do.

28:13.889 --> 28:15.656
So you want
to come on drops now?

28:15.758 --> 28:17.658
Huh?

28:17.760 --> 28:19.092
Move product?

28:19.194 --> 28:21.361
I mean, what are
you even asking me?

28:22.411 --> 28:24.982
I didn't come back here
to be a burden, Franklin.

28:25.067 --> 28:27.224
I want to help.

28:27.388 --> 28:30.789
But I also don't want
to be kept in the dark.

28:30.891 --> 28:32.924
Not anymore.

29:27.099 --> 29:28.325
This all from...

29:28.418 --> 29:30.318
- The raid.
- Yeah.

29:32.907 --> 29:34.940
You, uh, you want, you
want something to drink?

29:37.398 --> 29:39.331
Just wanted to see you.

29:39.807 --> 29:41.574
Check in with you.

29:41.817 --> 29:43.857
Anything I can do to ease
what you're going through.

29:44.069 --> 29:46.270
I appreciate it.

29:46.355 --> 29:48.455
But I don't think there's
much you can do here.

29:51.694 --> 29:53.428
You know, one of
the things I learned

29:53.513 --> 29:55.546
about Cuba that surprised me.

29:56.220 --> 29:59.349
The literacy rate is 100%.

29:59.896 --> 30:01.552
Everybody in Cuba,

30:01.654 --> 30:03.927
no matter their color or
class, can read and write.

30:04.012 --> 30:07.581
Go to decent schools,
get good medical care.

30:08.810 --> 30:11.944
They really do care
about their people.

30:12.046 --> 30:15.333
- I mean, it all can't be good.
- Yeah, well, yeah.

30:15.443 --> 30:18.084
I mean, there are problems.

30:18.678 --> 30:20.244
But not like here.

30:20.922 --> 30:22.755
Not like this.

30:24.359 --> 30:26.292
But look what it took
for them to get there.

30:26.394 --> 30:28.427
A revolution, right?

30:28.530 --> 30:31.464
That's what the fuck
we trying to do.

30:31.566 --> 30:32.999
Right.

30:33.101 --> 30:37.136
But there are other
ways to wage revolution.

30:37.238 --> 30:39.405
When we were with the panthers,

30:39.507 --> 30:41.974
lot of times, we made changes
without firing a shot.

30:42.076 --> 30:44.143
Well, maybe you should have.

30:44.245 --> 30:45.912
Maybe.

30:46.014 --> 30:49.515
But then violence becomes
the story, not justice.

30:49.617 --> 30:53.786
And you end up dead or in jail.

30:53.888 --> 30:56.123
And the worst part
of it, that's exactly

30:56.208 --> 30:58.342
what they want to happen.

30:59.427 --> 31:03.596
Not only do you
lose, but they win.

31:05.567 --> 31:07.935
So what you do, then?

31:10.071 --> 31:12.104
There are other ways to fight.

31:15.843 --> 31:19.645
Other ways to make change.

31:26.254 --> 31:28.287
And there are more
people out in this world

31:28.389 --> 31:31.023
who want to help than you know.

Clearly, our energy is
funky right now, so.

33:15.228 --> 33:16.560
Let's talk.

33:17.664 --> 33:20.427
- All right.
- No bullshit?

33:20.816 --> 33:22.249
No bullshit.

33:24.838 --> 33:26.871
You downplayed Teddy.

33:29.576 --> 33:31.709
How dangerous is the man
that killed your father

33:31.811 --> 33:33.845
and just showed
up a few days ago?

33:35.815 --> 33:37.949
My father went
after him and lost.

33:40.287 --> 33:43.935
Wasn't sure what happened
to him till I saw my mother.

33:45.292 --> 33:47.025
Teddy's different.

33:47.127 --> 33:49.227
Maybe paranoid.

33:49.329 --> 33:51.496
All business.

33:51.598 --> 33:56.034
As long as I keep the
money flowing, I'm safe.

33:56.136 --> 33:59.437
We're safe. For now.

33:59.539 --> 34:03.207
And that's the truth. All right?

34:03.310 --> 34:05.777
This a two-way street?

34:11.717 --> 34:13.685
How do you feel after
hearing from her?

34:13.786 --> 34:16.321
- Your mom?
- Mm-hmm.

34:17.556 --> 34:20.440
That you are the mama's boy
I thought you were from jump.

34:21.561 --> 34:23.494
Can't do no wrong in her eyes.

34:23.596 --> 34:25.163
Uh...

34:25.264 --> 34:27.998
And she seemed
kind of cool to me.

34:29.803 --> 34:31.536
Maybe I'm imagining it.

34:33.639 --> 34:36.674
And please don't shut her down
if she has something to say

34:36.775 --> 34:39.677
just 'cause you don't
want to hear it.

34:39.779 --> 34:42.045
Okay?

34:42.148 --> 34:43.581
Mm-hmm.

34:45.652 --> 34:48.553
When you asked me to move
in, I asked if it was safe.

34:48.655 --> 34:50.722
You said yes.

34:50.824 --> 34:52.757
But I was looking around
at your books, you know,

34:52.859 --> 34:55.326
I was being nosy,
and I found that.

35:01.067 --> 35:03.701
I bought this place
because of the security.

35:03.803 --> 35:05.803
And the location.

35:06.773 --> 35:09.240
This is just extra.

35:10.662 --> 35:13.163
I can get rid of it if
you don't want it around.

35:19.452 --> 35:22.353
I don't care about the gun.

35:22.455 --> 35:25.223
I told you what I
wanted from you.

35:25.318 --> 35:28.772
Maybe this place is safe,
but nowhere else is.

35:28.857 --> 35:31.929
And some strippers and a weirdly
quiet vet, they don't cut it.

35:32.032 --> 35:33.798
You need more.

35:33.900 --> 35:35.900
- We need more.
- I agree.

35:36.002 --> 35:38.069
I'll get on it
tomorrow, first thing.

35:39.572 --> 35:42.473
Where did you learn
how to do that?

35:42.575 --> 35:44.342
Told you how I grew up.

35:44.444 --> 35:46.411
You think my mom pulled
all that bullshit

35:46.513 --> 35:49.147
and didn't teach me how to
come save her if I needed to?

35:49.249 --> 35:52.116
Save her? What about you?

35:56.389 --> 35:58.423
. Come here.

36:04.898 --> 36:07.665
Think she'll ever come back?

36:07.767 --> 36:12.136
Walk into the office, say
she wants to be in our lives?

36:14.207 --> 36:17.341
If she does, we're
moving to Africa.

36:17.444 --> 36:20.812
Same day, and not looking back.

36:20.914 --> 36:22.480
'Cause once she's in

36:22.582 --> 36:24.849
. She's fucking in.

36:33.927 --> 36:36.294
- Sure thing.
- Pickup, 17.

36:54.353 --> 36:56.820
Excuse me,

36:57.626 --> 37:00.327
but have we met before?

37:02.122 --> 37:03.654
I'm not sure.

37:03.756 --> 37:06.824
I just returned
from Mexico City.

37:06.926 --> 37:08.059
Ah.

37:08.794 --> 37:11.341
I have good friends
there as well.

37:12.630 --> 37:13.862
Thanks.

37:16.693 --> 37:19.170
It's so nice to
finally meet you.

37:19.638 --> 37:21.544
Ana told me so much.

37:22.786 --> 37:25.044
My name is Ruben. Ruben.

37:25.129 --> 37:27.562
I'm Cissy. It's nice
to meet you, too.

37:27.647 --> 37:29.474
Nice to meet you, Cissy.

37:30.116 --> 37:32.783
So, how was your trip?

37:36.789 --> 37:40.427
Cissy, I want you to know,

37:42.107 --> 37:45.296
I think it's an incredibly
brave thing you're doing.

37:45.958 --> 37:48.443
And I'm sorry for all
that you've been through.

37:49.015 --> 37:51.382
You know, it must have
been a very difficult time.

37:57.844 --> 37:59.777
So, how does all this work?

38:00.474 --> 38:02.178
Well, now that we
established contact,

38:02.263 --> 38:03.952
we'll set up regular meetings.

38:04.037 --> 38:06.771
Sometimes here,
sometimes elsewhere.

38:06.900 --> 38:08.651
As long as neither of us
are under surveillance,

38:08.735 --> 38:09.950
we can meet out in the open...

38:10.035 --> 38:13.638
No, what-what, what
I actually meant...

38:13.740 --> 38:16.374
I've made contact
with my family.

38:16.476 --> 38:19.068
My son has confirmed
that he's back,

38:19.153 --> 38:20.686
just like Ana said he would.

38:21.071 --> 38:23.204
Teddy McDonald.

38:24.000 --> 38:27.302
So what do you need from me
to do what you got to do?

38:30.132 --> 38:33.167
I know what you want, Cissy.

38:33.415 --> 38:36.082
And I share your indignation
over what the CIA has done

38:36.241 --> 38:38.318
to you and your family.

38:38.869 --> 38:43.038
Let me be clear: I want answers first.

38:44.048 --> 38:46.582
What exactly happened to Alton.

38:46.667 --> 38:49.401
And I want to make
sure my family is safe.

38:50.336 --> 38:53.872
And then you can
kill Teddy McDonald.
