WEBVTT

00:01.369 --> 00:03.404
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Ah,
friends, you'll recall our Jane

00:03.437 --> 00:04.738
became a published author,

00:04.772 --> 00:06.574
and so, she tried
to get an agent.

00:06.607 --> 00:08.076
JANE:
You know Jeffrey Mullins?

00:08.109 --> 00:10.178
I would love to meet him.

00:10.211 --> 00:11.179
But that didn't work out.

00:11.212 --> 00:12.180
And even worse...

00:12.213 --> 00:13.747
Oh, my God!
...her book

00:13.781 --> 00:14.748
didn't exactly
create fireworks.

00:14.782 --> 00:18.086
"There is a sense here
of promise unfulfilled."

00:18.119 --> 00:20.088
But her kiss with Rafael...

00:20.121 --> 00:22.556
Well, that did.
Not as romantic:

00:22.590 --> 00:24.492
Alba turned down
Jorge's proposal.

00:24.525 --> 00:25.659
No.

00:25.693 --> 00:27.295
Oh, and Jane's
mom and dad got married.

00:27.328 --> 00:29.663
Only, he had a baby with Darci,

00:29.697 --> 00:32.200
who was in love with
his archrival, Esteban.

00:32.233 --> 00:34.635
I know! Straight out of
a telenovela, right?

00:34.668 --> 00:36.104
Well, imagine this...

00:36.137 --> 00:37.771
Petra's sister Anezka

00:37.805 --> 00:40.108
schemed against
Rafael's sister Luisa.

00:40.141 --> 00:42.110
And Petra found out,
and well...

00:42.143 --> 00:44.178
How long did you leave my sister
in an institution

00:44.212 --> 00:45.413
knowing she wasn't
hallucinating?!

00:45.446 --> 00:46.580
A week.

00:46.614 --> 00:48.816
NARRATOR:
Oh, and then Anezka went splat,

00:48.849 --> 00:51.419
leaving Petra as a person
of interest in her death.

00:51.452 --> 00:54.122
So she had to get a lawyer,
who was also named Jane.

00:54.155 --> 00:54.955
Only problem...

00:54.988 --> 00:58.126
Okay. I'm her lawyer.
What's next?

00:58.159 --> 00:59.293
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Yikes, right?

00:59.327 --> 01:01.329
So let's dive in.

01:01.362 --> 01:05.299
When Jane Gloriana Villanueva
was 23 and a half years old,

01:05.333 --> 01:07.735
she had a magical kiss
with Rafael.

01:07.768 --> 01:09.537
It was the kind of kiss

01:09.570 --> 01:13.241
you could only have when
you're young, uninhibited,

01:13.274 --> 01:14.675
and free of the pressures of...

01:14.708 --> 01:16.144
MATEO:
You guys are kissing!

01:16.177 --> 01:17.445
Does that mean you're
getting married?

01:17.478 --> 01:20.281
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
...having a child.

01:20.314 --> 01:21.849
Oh, no, no, no, no.
No, no, no, no.

01:21.882 --> 01:23.251
We're not getting married.
That was,

01:23.284 --> 01:24.185
that was, that
was just, uh...

01:24.218 --> 01:25.786
Um, Mateo...

01:25.819 --> 01:27.855
Mommy and Daddy
are just exploring

01:27.888 --> 01:29.223
our feelings
for one another

01:29.257 --> 01:31.225
in a romantic way.

01:31.259 --> 01:33.227
Exactly, and we don't
know where it will go

01:33.261 --> 01:34.228
because it's brand-new.

01:34.262 --> 01:35.463
And if it works, great.

01:35.496 --> 01:37.298
And if it doesn't, that's okay,

01:37.331 --> 01:39.733
because nothing will change
for you.

01:39.767 --> 01:41.902
Nothing.
Does that make sense?

01:41.935 --> 01:44.538
I've never been so happy
in my life!

01:44.572 --> 01:46.106
JANE:
Oh!

02:38.959 --> 02:41.729
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Which brings us to...

02:41.762 --> 02:44.198
I told them that
you and Daddy

02:44.232 --> 02:46.234
were exploring each
other with kisses.

02:46.267 --> 02:47.735
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
So much for the down-low.

02:47.768 --> 02:49.603
Oh, boy.
XIOMARA: So what changed?

02:49.637 --> 02:51.572
I don't know how
I feel about this. Yeah.
Last I heard, you weren't...

02:51.605 --> 02:53.841
ROGELIO: I mean, we were just
talking about this yesterday.
Everyone stop.

02:53.874 --> 02:55.909
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Geez, talk about pressure.

02:55.943 --> 02:57.911
It was just one kiss.
Technically, two.

02:57.945 --> 03:00.281
And like we told Mateo,

03:00.314 --> 03:02.683
we're figuring it out.

03:02.716 --> 03:04.718
Mm-hmm.
A-And we're gonna just
need some time to do that.

03:07.288 --> 03:09.357
So, is there

03:09.390 --> 03:11.359
some other reason
everybody's here?

03:11.392 --> 03:15.363
Beyond potentially confusing
a five

03:15.396 --> 03:16.664
Well, I have big news.

03:16.697 --> 03:19.667
I have decided to take
one year off from work

03:19.700 --> 03:22.636
to become a stay-at-home
dad to Baby.

03:22.670 --> 03:25.439
Wow, Ro.
I really admire that.

03:25.473 --> 03:27.241
I do, too.

03:27.275 --> 03:29.477
Oh. Hang on, that's my
publisher. I'll be right back.

03:31.512 --> 03:33.481
Oh. We'll be fine.

03:33.514 --> 03:35.316
I agreed to do

03:35.349 --> 03:37.751
a slightly embarrassing
overseas commercial.

03:39.320 --> 03:40.788
It is related
to digestive issues.

03:40.821 --> 03:41.922
It's not important.

03:44.525 --> 03:46.360
:

03:52.866 --> 03:54.268
ROGELIO:
The point is,

03:54.302 --> 03:55.303
it will cover the bills.

03:55.336 --> 03:57.638
And now, I can support Xo

03:57.671 --> 03:59.840
while she builds up
her dance studio

03:59.873 --> 04:01.409
and focus

04:01.442 --> 04:02.910
on my beautiful baby, Baby.

04:02.943 --> 04:05.546
In fact, I made a vision board.

04:05.579 --> 04:07.481
*

04:09.450 --> 04:10.618
I intend to raise

04:10.651 --> 04:11.785
a strong,

04:11.819 --> 04:13.487
self-reliant,

04:13.521 --> 04:15.423
intelligent daughter.

04:15.456 --> 04:16.624
Just like Jane.

04:16.657 --> 04:18.392
I was just dropped
by my publisher.

04:18.426 --> 04:19.660
What?

04:22.330 --> 04:23.931
Yeah, they won't option
my second book

04:23.964 --> 04:26.367
because not enough people
are buying my first.

04:26.400 --> 04:27.968
I'm sorry, hon.

04:31.705 --> 04:33.073
XIOMARA: Yeah,
you know how many books

04:33.106 --> 04:35.343
J.K. Rowling wrote
before Harry Potter?

04:35.376 --> 04:36.977
None. It was her first try.

04:37.010 --> 04:39.813
And she did it in a coffee shop
while holding a baby on her lap.

04:39.847 --> 04:42.616
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Wow! Talk
about your fantastic beasts.

04:42.650 --> 04:43.951
ROGELIO:
Who cares?

04:43.984 --> 04:46.454
You're still published.
You'll build on that.

04:46.487 --> 04:48.956
Really? Very few women of color
get published.

04:48.989 --> 04:50.057
And when we do,
we cannot afford

04:50.090 --> 04:52.426
to screw it up, because
we don't get a second chance

04:52.460 --> 04:54.462
like our peers.
NARRATOR: Preach.

04:54.495 --> 04:57.498
I'm actually in worse shape
than before I sold my book.

04:57.531 --> 04:58.366
I don't have
the whiff of promise

04:58.399 --> 04:59.667
like a first-time author.

04:59.700 --> 05:01.702
Instead, I have
the stench of failure.

05:01.735 --> 05:04.538
Come on, hon. I think you're
being a little dramatic.

05:04.572 --> 05:06.440
No!  They
actually used the word "stench"!

05:14.482 --> 05:17.485
RAFAEL:
Okay, so it's gonna be hard.

05:17.518 --> 05:19.119
It's always been hard.

05:19.152 --> 05:21.555
And you have fought for this
every step of the way.

05:21.589 --> 05:23.491
So you just keep fighting.

05:23.524 --> 05:25.626
And, yeah, you've been
a little stuck lately.

05:25.659 --> 05:29.497
But the only way to get past
that is to keep writing.

05:29.530 --> 05:30.964
So get on that.

05:33.734 --> 05:35.436
Okay. Mommy has

05:35.469 --> 05:36.437
a few hours.

05:36.470 --> 05:37.871
You know what I'm gonna do?

05:37.905 --> 05:40.541
Start brainstorming.
Because, Mateo,

05:40.574 --> 05:44.378
when you get knocked down,
you get back up again.

05:45.746 --> 05:48.549
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Or at least you try to.

05:48.582 --> 05:50.618
Just dive in.
Something romantic.

05:50.651 --> 05:52.152
Someplace romantic.

05:52.185 --> 05:54.622
Hmm.

05:55.656 --> 05:58.025
*

06:05.566 --> 06:07.067
Hello.

06:07.100 --> 06:09.737
I'm Nicolas, your new groom.

06:09.770 --> 06:11.972
I thought perhaps
you can give me riding lessons.

06:12.005 --> 06:14.074
I saw you take two
fences out there.

06:14.107 --> 06:16.009
So you are saying no?

06:16.043 --> 06:19.580
I'm saying...
Hmm?

06:19.613 --> 06:23.417
...that we need to manage
Mateo's expectations.

06:23.451 --> 06:26.487
ROGELIO:
My perfect, amazing daughter.

06:26.520 --> 06:28.822
Why is it you grow
more beautiful

06:28.856 --> 06:31.158
every time I see you?

06:31.191 --> 06:32.826
We have very exciting news,

06:32.860 --> 06:35.162
Rogelio.
Esteban is shooting

06:35.195 --> 06:39.099
a mediocre but long-term series
in Moldova?

06:39.132 --> 06:42.470
Moosh. Be the bigger man.

06:42.503 --> 06:44.137
Since you are.

06:46.740 --> 06:48.609
The news is

06:48.642 --> 06:52.045
we have finally found
the perfect nanny.

06:52.079 --> 06:54.482
Felicia Romero.

06:54.515 --> 06:57.751
She's A-list. Highly,
highly recommended and has

06:57.785 --> 07:00.087
tons of CBE.

07:00.120 --> 07:03.156
While that is impressive,

07:03.190 --> 07:05.058
I have a better idea.

07:06.059 --> 07:08.462
What are you doing?
I am now

07:08.496 --> 07:09.997
a stay-at-home dad.

07:10.030 --> 07:13.667
So, I'll be happy to be
Baby's nanny on Darci's days.

07:13.701 --> 07:15.869
No way, Rogelio.
You'll do it for a few days

07:15.903 --> 07:17.605
and then get bored
and flake out.

07:17.638 --> 07:19.540
And by then, we'll
have lost Felicia.

07:19.573 --> 07:21.975
And we will never find
another Felicia.

07:22.009 --> 07:23.977
I won't flake.
I'm 100% committed.

07:24.011 --> 07:25.646
I'll be the nanny.

07:25.679 --> 07:27.648
The dad-nanny.

07:27.681 --> 07:29.783
The Danny!

07:29.817 --> 07:32.753
Please?
Let me do this for Baby.

07:33.821 --> 07:34.988
Fine.

07:36.023 --> 07:37.725
Bye, Felicia.

07:37.758 --> 07:39.560
MATEO:
Don't go.

07:39.593 --> 07:41.662
I want us all

07:41.695 --> 07:43.531
to still live together.

07:43.564 --> 07:45.599
Oh, I know, buddy.

07:45.633 --> 07:48.001
But me staying here
was always temporary.

07:48.035 --> 07:51.539
And Mommy can come to
my new apartment all the time.

07:51.572 --> 07:52.973
Really?
Of course.

08:06.854 --> 08:08.789
Rafael is still mad at me.

08:08.822 --> 08:11.659
Whoa. Personal space.

08:11.692 --> 08:12.893
Can you help me?

08:12.926 --> 08:14.928
I've apologized
over and over.

08:14.962 --> 08:16.597
You left his sister
in an institution

08:16.630 --> 08:18.666
when you knew she
wasn't hallucinating.

08:18.699 --> 08:19.933
And I feel bad about that.

08:19.967 --> 08:22.670
He says he's not coming
to brunch on Saturday.

08:22.703 --> 08:26.239
And you know brunches
are sacred family time.

08:26.273 --> 08:29.977
Actually, I think we should
skip brunch for a bit.

08:30.010 --> 08:31.278
What?

08:31.311 --> 08:32.780
You just push people
too far, Petra.

08:32.813 --> 08:34.014
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
I'll say.

08:35.115 --> 08:36.750
JANE:
And at a certain point,

08:36.784 --> 08:39.119
they can't come back anymore.

08:44.658 --> 08:45.593
Hello!

08:45.626 --> 08:47.327
I'm home!

08:47.360 --> 08:50.898
MATEO: Daddy's in the shower
and I'm in your room!

08:52.900 --> 08:54.668
Oh. What's going on?

08:54.702 --> 08:57.638
I'm helping you pack
so you can come live with Daddy.

08:57.671 --> 08:59.573
What?
Don't you want to live there?

08:59.607 --> 09:00.674
I live here.

09:00.708 --> 09:01.842
But Daddy wants you to.

09:01.875 --> 09:03.276
Mateo...
He does!

09:03.310 --> 09:05.112
He told me!
Why are you the only one

09:05.145 --> 09:07.781
who doesn't want us
to be a family?!

09:13.821 --> 09:16.657
Of course I didn't say that.
I said you can come over

09:16.690 --> 09:19.727
as much as you want.
Well, somehow,
I'm the one getting in the way

09:19.760 --> 09:20.928
of his happily ever after.

09:20.961 --> 09:23.363
We'll straighten him out.
Don't worry.

09:26.133 --> 09:27.267
What?

09:27.300 --> 09:29.670
Just that...

09:29.703 --> 09:31.238
if I'm honest,

09:31.271 --> 09:32.673
Mateo kind of
got it right.

09:32.706 --> 09:35.375
Not about what I said.
About how I feel.

09:35.408 --> 09:37.110
I do want us together.

09:37.144 --> 09:38.746
Happily ever after.

09:38.779 --> 09:40.781
And I'm not pushing.

09:40.814 --> 09:43.316
I just want you to know
that I'm all in.

09:43.350 --> 09:46.219
And I know, okay,
the timing is bad.

09:46.253 --> 09:47.755
You just got out
of a relationship,

09:47.788 --> 09:49.657
y-your career isn't where
you want it to be...

09:49.690 --> 09:50.658
My career is nowhere.

09:50.691 --> 09:53.293
I don't have an agent,
a publisher, an idea.

09:53.326 --> 09:55.095
And you'll get
all of those.

09:55.128 --> 09:56.296
I know you will.

09:56.329 --> 09:58.799
Maybe.

10:01.434 --> 10:02.970
Definitely.

10:03.003 --> 10:04.672
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
And, friends, briefly,

10:04.705 --> 10:06.106
oh-so-briefly,

10:06.139 --> 10:08.842
it was just them, there,
in that moment,

10:08.876 --> 10:10.678
without
all the outside pressure.

10:10.711 --> 10:12.846
But it's not just that.

10:12.880 --> 10:15.849
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Alas, it never is.

10:15.883 --> 10:19.019
Honestly, I'm having whiplash.

10:19.052 --> 10:22.856
I mean, six weeks ago,
you were sleeping with Katherine

10:22.890 --> 10:24.925
to get your hotel back.

10:24.958 --> 10:28.128
And that was a-a low point.
I know.

10:28.161 --> 10:29.963
But, still...

10:29.997 --> 10:31.431
it was pretty dark.

10:31.464 --> 10:33.834
But I'm in
a different place now.

10:33.867 --> 10:37.871
I promise.
And I-I am not going back there.

10:38.872 --> 10:40.874
Just trust me, Jane.

10:40.908 --> 10:42.776
PETRA:
Jane, Jane, Jane.

10:42.810 --> 10:44.678
Everything in my life
is now about Jane.

10:44.712 --> 10:46.947
Personally, because our children
share a father,

10:46.980 --> 10:48.381
and now professionally.

10:48.415 --> 10:50.317
Since you're my lawyer.

10:50.350 --> 10:52.019
Anyway, that's why

10:52.052 --> 10:54.321
it would just be easier
if I called you J.R.

10:54.354 --> 10:56.690
No.

10:56.724 --> 10:57.725
Oh, come on.

10:57.758 --> 10:59.359
If you call me J.R.,

10:59.392 --> 11:00.694
I'll call you Peter.

11:00.728 --> 11:03.230
That's a little punitive.

11:03.263 --> 11:05.766
Here's why we're meeting.

11:05.799 --> 11:08.235
The police went over
all of your e-mails,

11:08.268 --> 11:11.772
and you said some pretty nasty
stuff about your sister.

11:11.805 --> 11:13.406
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Some highlights...

11:25.786 --> 11:27.855
Sorry. I'll translate that one.

11:31.191 --> 11:33.326
Yeah. That's pretty damning.

11:33.360 --> 11:34.962
Now they're saying
they want

11:34.995 --> 11:37.164
to create a computer
model of the scene,

11:37.197 --> 11:39.466
so they're requesting a
blueprint of the guest room.

11:39.499 --> 11:40.934
No way. Not without a warrant.

11:40.968 --> 11:42.402
I've watched
Law & Order.

11:42.435 --> 11:43.937
They're liable to find
any small thing

11:43.971 --> 11:45.272
to try to build a case
against me.

11:47.140 --> 11:49.810
Well, first of all, never trust
television writers.

11:49.843 --> 11:51.779
My ex-girlfriend was one,

11:51.812 --> 11:54.114
and they just build things up
for the sake of drama.

11:54.147 --> 11:55.348
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Which reminds me,

11:55.382 --> 11:56.917
who is Jane Ramos working for?

11:58.118 --> 11:59.987
RAMOS: And I really think
cooperating with the police

12:00.020 --> 12:03.523
will convince them
that you have nothing to hide.

12:03.556 --> 12:04.457
KRISHNA:
Sorry to interrupt,

12:04.491 --> 12:06.193
but Rafael is here
and I thought you'd want

12:06.226 --> 12:07.060
to see him since
you're in the doghouse.

12:07.094 --> 12:08.762
Krishna, that's not
an appropriate thing

12:08.796 --> 12:09.930
to announce
when I'm in a meeting.

12:09.963 --> 12:11.832
I know.

12:12.966 --> 12:14.935
Excuse me for a second.

12:19.072 --> 12:21.241
Well, this is a surprise.

12:22.442 --> 12:24.244
The girls are upstairs.

12:24.277 --> 12:28.115
I'm on my way, but I wanted to
ask you for a favor first.

12:45.933 --> 12:47.935
Is everything all right?

12:47.968 --> 12:49.402
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Geez, I got to be careful

12:49.436 --> 12:50.971
not to overuse that.

12:51.004 --> 12:53.040
Not really.

12:53.073 --> 12:54.975
My mother has early
onset Alzheimer's,

12:55.008 --> 12:57.377
and I just found out
the top specialist here

12:57.410 --> 12:59.947
in Miami won't take
any new patients.

13:01.614 --> 13:05.919
So... will you turn over
the blueprints to the police?

13:05.953 --> 13:08.288
I'll think about it.

13:08.321 --> 13:09.857
XIOMARA:
What's wrong?

13:14.361 --> 13:15.863
What?

13:15.896 --> 13:18.098
Oh, my God.
How did it go?

13:30.577 --> 13:31.979
XIOMARA:
He can't do that.

13:32.012 --> 13:33.881
Who the hell
does he think he is?

13:33.914 --> 13:35.048
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Uh, apparently every man

13:35.082 --> 13:36.349
in a position of power

13:36.383 --> 13:39.219
in the whole entire world,
except me.

13:39.252 --> 13:41.421
You tell Jorge that's no way
to treat you,

13:41.454 --> 13:43.857
and if he does it again,
you report him.

13:43.891 --> 13:45.926
ROGELIO: Well, this man
couldn't agree more.

13:45.959 --> 13:47.494
More iced coffee, ladies?

13:47.527 --> 13:48.929
I ground the
beans myself,

13:48.962 --> 13:50.163
and infused them with cinnamon.

13:50.197 --> 13:52.165
Thank God for Pinterest.

13:52.199 --> 13:53.566
No, thanks, hon.
I got to go to work.

13:53.600 --> 13:55.002
Okay. Well, have you figured out

13:55.035 --> 13:56.236
what you want
on your vision board?

13:56.269 --> 13:58.371
Well, I need four more students
a month

13:58.405 --> 14:00.040
for the studio to break even.

14:00.073 --> 14:02.943
Not sexy enough
for a vision board.

14:02.976 --> 14:05.278
Regardless, that's the goal,
so I'm gonna

14:05.312 --> 14:07.580
have an open house,
offer a few free classes.

14:07.614 --> 14:09.116
I love it. Yes.

14:09.149 --> 14:10.083
An open house now,

14:10.117 --> 14:11.985
eventually a franchise.

14:12.019 --> 14:14.254
And I'm here to
help in my capacity

14:14.287 --> 14:16.089
as homemaker and support system.

14:16.123 --> 14:19.292
Okay. Well, great.

14:19.326 --> 14:22.295
Thanks.

14:22.329 --> 14:24.364
Have a great day at work.

14:24.397 --> 14:26.133
I'll have dinner waiting.

14:30.070 --> 14:32.105
Yay.

14:33.573 --> 14:36.109
Everything you do is so cute.
You were born to be on-screen.

14:45.418 --> 14:48.021
Uh

14:48.055 --> 14:49.923
DARCI: What the hell is going on
over there?

14:49.957 --> 14:52.325
You've been posting pictures
for five hours straight.

14:52.359 --> 14:54.527
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Which
was true, for the record.

15:01.969 --> 15:04.404
Well, we're just having fun.

15:04.437 --> 15:07.574
Rogelio, you are supposed to be
taking care of your child,

15:07.607 --> 15:11.211
not using her to raise
your social media profile.

15:11.244 --> 15:14.114
Do you know who does that?
Heidi and Spencer.

15:14.147 --> 15:17.584
DARCI: A-listers maintain
their children's privacy.

15:17.617 --> 15:19.586
There's a reason you never see
George and Amal

15:19.619 --> 15:21.254
doing the pap stroll
with their twins.

15:21.288 --> 15:24.024
So no more baby
on social media, period.

15:24.057 --> 15:25.558
You had me at Heidi and Spencer.

15:25.592 --> 15:26.994
DARCI:
Thank you.

15:27.027 --> 15:29.729
Now talk to me.
Did she take her morning poop?

15:29.762 --> 15:32.032
Uh, no.

15:32.065 --> 15:33.400
Shoot. She holds when
she's nervous.

15:33.433 --> 15:35.102
She's definitely nervous.

15:35.135 --> 15:37.504
Stop taking pictures and try
and get your daughter to poop.

15:42.109 --> 15:44.244
:
What're you so happy about?

15:44.277 --> 15:46.980
Oh, just that I got you
a meeting

15:47.014 --> 15:49.349
with Petra's book agent friend.

15:49.382 --> 15:52.185
Jeffrey Mullins?
Yes.

15:52.219 --> 15:55.022
Yes, but I have to share
the credit with Petra.

15:55.055 --> 15:57.124
She was actually pretty great;
she wouldn't let him hang up

15:57.157 --> 15:59.626
until he moved a lunch and
agreed to meet you on Friday.

15:59.659 --> 16:02.195
As in in two days?

16:02.229 --> 16:04.164
Yeah. What's wrong?

16:04.197 --> 16:06.066
He'll ask me the question.

16:06.099 --> 16:07.200
What question?
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
The question.

16:07.234 --> 16:09.102
What am I writing next?

16:09.136 --> 16:11.071
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Sorry. Trying to stop.

16:11.104 --> 16:14.041
And I have no idea
what I'm writing next.

16:14.074 --> 16:16.209
I'm sorry. I mean, I can
ask Petra to-to push it.

16:16.243 --> 16:17.544
Not after he moved
his schedule around.

16:17.577 --> 16:19.579
Look, I know you're
just trying to help,

16:19.612 --> 16:21.581
but you can't fix
my writing career.

16:21.614 --> 16:23.750
I know. I was just...

16:27.620 --> 16:30.123
Anyway, it's fine.

16:30.157 --> 16:33.260
Uh, but I should figure out what
I'm pitching to Jeffrey Mullins.

16:36.329 --> 16:38.331
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Last time.

16:43.703 --> 16:45.338
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
There is nothing worse

16:45.372 --> 16:47.674
than writer's block.

16:47.707 --> 16:50.210
Yeah, that's not a good opener.

16:50.243 --> 16:51.344
Come on, Jane.

16:51.378 --> 16:53.580
Romance, passion, longing.

17:03.690 --> 17:05.192
Okay, a prison.

17:05.225 --> 17:07.260
We can work with prison.

17:11.498 --> 17:13.733
I'm innocent!
I'm not supposed to be here.

17:13.766 --> 17:14.734
Please. I didn't do
anything wrong.

17:14.767 --> 17:16.403
I believe you, Estela.

17:16.436 --> 17:17.670
Really?

17:17.704 --> 17:20.407
Yes. And I am gonna
get you out of here.

17:20.440 --> 17:21.408
Oh.

17:21.441 --> 17:22.742
And once I do...
Yes.

17:22.775 --> 17:25.278
...you'll come over
to my new apartment,

17:25.312 --> 17:26.613
so we can convince Mateo

17:26.646 --> 17:28.515
that you're not the villain
destroying our family.

17:28.548 --> 17:31.284
Ugh.

17:33.286 --> 17:34.287
Yeah, just blocked.

17:34.321 --> 17:35.788
Where are you going?

17:41.794 --> 17:44.697
Nice. Show him who's boss.

17:44.731 --> 17:45.765
Hmm.
NARRATOR:
Well, technically, he is.

17:45.798 --> 17:47.200
But, yeah.

17:47.234 --> 17:48.568
Go get him, Alba.

17:53.573 --> 17:55.308
Damn, Jorge.

17:55.342 --> 17:58.478
That's the fastest rebound
I've ever seen.

18:03.716 --> 18:05.718
RAFAEL:
Okay, set expectations low.

18:09.389 --> 18:11.090
My new apartment.

18:12.459 --> 18:14.227
This is it?

18:15.662 --> 18:17.764
Well, I said to set
expectations low.

18:17.797 --> 18:19.366
I didn't know
what that meant.

18:19.399 --> 18:22.535
Oh, wow. Original
art deco windows.

18:22.569 --> 18:26.639
Whoo. And you have
a fire escape?

18:26.673 --> 18:30.777
Exactly. And it's cozy, and who
doesn't love cozy, right?

18:30.810 --> 18:33.313
Now, Mommy, out.

18:33.346 --> 18:34.447
No.

18:34.481 --> 18:35.582
Hey, no fair.
Yes, fair.

18:35.615 --> 18:36.916
It's boy time
and I want it to be just us.

18:36.949 --> 18:39.452
Okay? Go.

18:39.486 --> 18:40.853
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Wow. A little harsh.

18:40.887 --> 18:42.622
Thanks for kicking me out.

18:42.655 --> 18:44.891
No problem. And
I'll talk to him.

18:44.924 --> 18:46.759
Make sure he knows
you're not the bad guy.

18:46.793 --> 18:48.328
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Ah, I see.

18:48.361 --> 18:49.896
Even though I am.
Hey.

18:49.929 --> 18:51.631
I'm the one who
keeps screwing up.

18:51.664 --> 18:53.833
No. Stop.

19:03.276 --> 19:06.946
Uh, any ideas for your
agent meeting tomorrow?

19:06.979 --> 19:10.517
No ideas, per se,
but I did do some research.

19:10.550 --> 19:12.552
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Ah, yes. Jane's other passion.

19:12.585 --> 19:14.921
And I looked up
the hottest books right now,

19:14.954 --> 19:16.523
pulled trends and themes

19:16.556 --> 19:18.325
from the most successful
romance novels,

19:18.358 --> 19:20.727
and came up with
three general areas.

19:20.760 --> 19:22.862
I'll pitch them,
see how the agents respond,

19:22.895 --> 19:24.397
and go from there.

19:24.431 --> 19:26.199
Well, kick ass.

19:31.538 --> 19:33.340
JANE:
It's a sweeping romance.

19:33.373 --> 19:36.443
An idea I've been toying with
for a while.

19:36.476 --> 19:38.378
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Translation, since last night.

19:38.411 --> 19:40.547
Think about Outlander,
but instead of time travel,

19:40.580 --> 19:42.349
we do it with reincarnation.

19:42.382 --> 19:44.851
Yeah, unfortunately, we already
have something similar.

19:44.884 --> 19:47.754
Okay. How about a take
on The Notebook? Ah.

19:47.787 --> 19:49.456
But with vampires.

19:49.489 --> 19:53.626
The market's oversaturated
with vampire romances.

19:53.660 --> 19:54.694
You got anything else?

19:54.727 --> 19:55.862
Yeah, sure.

19:55.895 --> 19:57.464
My favorite, actually.

19:57.497 --> 19:59.799
How about
Fifty Shades of Grey

19:59.832 --> 20:02.269
with a role reversal where
the heroine's the boss?

20:04.871 --> 20:05.872
Petra.

20:08.575 --> 20:11.244
Leslie, this is Petra.

20:11.278 --> 20:13.012
The momtrepreneur.

20:13.045 --> 20:15.915
I think I read about you
in Ocean Drive.

20:15.948 --> 20:17.584
Yes. They did
that feature

20:17.617 --> 20:18.785
when I
renovated the hotel.

20:18.818 --> 20:20.587
Uh, anyway,
just wanted to make sure

20:20.620 --> 20:21.888
you all got settled.
We did.

20:21.921 --> 20:24.324
No, stay, stay, stay.

20:24.357 --> 20:25.458
No, I couldn't.

20:26.626 --> 20:28.461
Yeah, stay. Definitely.

20:28.495 --> 20:29.996
Okay.

20:30.029 --> 20:31.498
Now, Petra has had

20:31.531 --> 20:33.833
such an amazing life.

20:33.866 --> 20:36.636
Oh, no. Please, Jeffrey.
This meeting's not about me.

20:36.669 --> 20:38.671
Oh, come on.
Your story is incredible.

20:38.705 --> 20:41.608
I mean, talk about pulling
yourself up by your bootstraps.

20:41.641 --> 20:42.909
She used to play violin

20:42.942 --> 20:45.278
on the streets of Prague
for pocket change.

20:45.312 --> 20:46.746
LESLIE:
I remember thinking

20:46.779 --> 20:48.681
just based on
the Ocean Dri article,

20:48.715 --> 20:51.918
that Petra could author
a great lifestyle book.

20:51.951 --> 20:53.286
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Did she just say "author"?

20:53.320 --> 20:54.521
As in "book author"?

20:54.554 --> 20:55.855
LESLIE:
I mean, she does

20:55.888 --> 20:58.291
look like the non-evil Ivanka.

20:58.325 --> 21:00.059
: Oh, please,
I can't stand Ivanka.

21:00.092 --> 21:01.861
She tried
to sell me a few

21:01.894 --> 21:03.763
of those bum condos
a few years back.

21:03.796 --> 21:05.598
See? Now, that's
the kind of thing that would be

21:05.632 --> 21:06.599
great in the book.

21:06.633 --> 21:08.368
:
Yeah.

21:08.401 --> 21:09.769
Hmm. So anyway...

21:09.802 --> 21:11.371
You know,
a lifestyle book

21:11.404 --> 21:13.072
could turn you
into a brand.
That's so funny

21:13.105 --> 21:14.741
you say that,
'cause I've always toyed

21:14.774 --> 21:16.309
with branding myself.

21:17.043 --> 21:18.745
Well, what about Jane?
Yeah.

21:18.778 --> 21:21.548
Oh, right. Your Fifty Shades
idea sounds like fun.

21:21.581 --> 21:23.616
Send me the first chapter
as soon as you have it.

21:23.650 --> 21:25.051
And you-- get me
a short proposal.

21:25.084 --> 21:27.053
I will sell it by
the end of the week.

21:27.086 --> 21:29.922
What do you say?
You want to write a book?

21:31.458 --> 21:32.959
Jane thinks you should, right?

21:32.992 --> 21:35.061
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And
what else could Jane say but...

21:35.094 --> 21:36.796
Of course.

21:36.829 --> 21:38.831
You should totally write a book.

21:43.470 --> 21:46.038
Well... okay!

21:46.072 --> 21:48.074
: All right.
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Yeah.

21:48.107 --> 21:50.843
So I'd say Jane is
Fifty Shades of Green.

21:57.917 --> 22:00.453
Jane, if you don't want me
to take this book deal, I won't.

22:00.487 --> 22:03.456
Hey, if you are genuinely
interested in writing a book,

22:03.490 --> 22:05.525
then, by all means, go for it.

22:05.558 --> 22:07.760
All right, fine.
I'm turning it down.

22:07.794 --> 22:09.929
No, not
on my account.

22:09.962 --> 22:11.598
You're clearly upset about it,
and the whole point

22:11.631 --> 22:13.366
of getting the agents here
to meet with you

22:13.400 --> 22:15.034
was so that you and I
could move past things.

22:15.067 --> 22:16.603
Life isn't transactional, Petra.

22:16.636 --> 22:18.438
If you turn down the book deal,
it's not like

22:18.471 --> 22:20.540
I'm gonna suddenly forget all
the horrible things you've done.

22:20.573 --> 22:24.411
Fine. If they aren't related,
then I'm writing it.
Great!

22:24.444 --> 22:25.845
Good luck on your
Czechoslovakian

22:25.878 --> 22:28.548
bootstrap beach
lifestyle book!

22:30.182 --> 22:32.151
PETRA: Can you believe
she said that, Krishna?

22:32.184 --> 22:34.120
That everything I do
is transactional?

22:34.153 --> 22:35.955
I mean, I've done
plenty of things

22:35.988 --> 22:38.458
out of the goodness
of my heart for you, haven't I?

22:38.491 --> 22:40.793
Like what?
Well,

22:40.827 --> 22:42.895
I can't remember right now.
You're putting me on the spot.

22:42.929 --> 22:45.398
Anyway, I want
to do something now.

22:45.432 --> 22:47.800
For me?
No. For J.R.'s mother.

22:47.834 --> 22:49.969
I want to get her in to see
that Alzheimer's specialist.

22:50.002 --> 22:51.804
I have a lot of connections
at the hospital. So,

22:51.838 --> 22:54.173
move mountains, Krishna. I want
an appointment by end of day.

22:54.206 --> 22:55.708
Okay.
And after that,
I'm gonna need you

22:55.742 --> 22:57.577
to get me some
writing supplies.

22:57.610 --> 23:01.080
Green tea, candles, Montblanc
pens, background music.

23:01.113 --> 23:03.683
ROGELIO:
Let's go.

23:03.716 --> 23:07.487
* One, two, make a poop

23:07.520 --> 23:09.956
* Three, four,
out the back door... *

23:09.989 --> 23:12.425
Come on, come on,
you can do it.

23:12.459 --> 23:15.061
Is it me, Baby?

23:15.094 --> 23:16.763
You know I love you very much,

23:16.796 --> 23:20.800
but are you not comfortable
with our arrangement yet?

23:20.833 --> 23:22.769
It's all right.

23:22.802 --> 23:26.105
I'm not 100% comfortable
yet, either.

23:26.138 --> 23:28.508
In fact...

23:28.541 --> 23:30.643
I am feeling a little...

23:30.677 --> 23:32.779
I don't know.

23:32.812 --> 23:34.947
Lonely?

23:36.983 --> 23:40.520
But we'll get used to it,
and then...

23:44.624 --> 23:46.192
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
And, friends,

23:46.225 --> 23:47.627
standing there,
covered in poop,

23:47.660 --> 23:49.962
Rogelio had never been
more relieved,

23:49.996 --> 23:52.799
and neither had his daughter.

23:53.833 --> 23:56.803
Okay. Say,
"No more constipation."

23:56.836 --> 24:00.473
God, I want to post this so bad!

24:00.507 --> 24:02.842
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And in
that moment, Rogelio thought:

24:02.875 --> 24:04.877
"If you take a selfie,
and no one sees it,

24:04.911 --> 24:07.079
do you even exist?"

24:07.113 --> 24:08.781
Okay.

24:08.815 --> 24:12.485
We have two whole hours
before your nap!

24:13.553 --> 24:15.722
We can play peekaboo,

24:15.755 --> 24:18.090
or you can
lie on your stomach.

24:19.792 --> 24:23.162
Or, well, those are pretty much
the options.

24:45.818 --> 24:48.187
ALBA:
Xiomara?

24:53.826 --> 24:56.128
I don't know what to put
on my vision board.

25:01.568 --> 25:03.135
No, I just mean that...

25:03.169 --> 25:05.538
when I try to think
about what I want,

25:05.572 --> 25:08.608
what I see for my business, I...

25:12.344 --> 25:14.614
I'm not even dancing
anymore, Ma.

25:14.647 --> 25:16.315
Just administrating

25:16.348 --> 25:20.019
and solving problems
and hounding people for payments

25:20.052 --> 25:21.754
and dealing with insurance
and...

25:21.788 --> 25:23.022
I hate it!
Xiomara...

25:23.055 --> 25:24.557
I know what
you're gonna say.

25:24.591 --> 25:27.193
"Stick with it," because
I never stick with anything.

25:33.666 --> 25:36.769
It's kind of late to start
thinking about a new career.

25:36.803 --> 25:38.871
Uh...

25:45.311 --> 25:46.746
Well, fine.

25:46.779 --> 25:49.181
It's true
for you, too.
Hmm.

25:49.215 --> 25:52.652
Who cares that Jorge was
out on some rebound?

25:57.624 --> 25:59.558
Sofia

26:10.369 --> 26:12.705
RAFAEL:
Is everything okay?

26:12.739 --> 26:14.807
Yes, I just wanted
to talk to you because,

26:14.841 --> 26:17.877
well, Mateo had a really
tough time in school this week.

26:17.910 --> 26:19.045
Really?
Yeah.

26:19.078 --> 26:20.947
He's been pretty distracted
and irritable.

26:20.980 --> 26:23.215
And when I said I was gonna
talk to his parents,

26:23.249 --> 26:25.017
he started to cry,
and begged me not to

26:25.051 --> 26:26.686
before some "big decision

26:26.719 --> 26:28.254
about whether you are gonna
be a family."

26:30.757 --> 26:33.660
A lot's up in the air
right now at home.

26:33.693 --> 26:35.728
Well, I don't want to pry,
but whatever it is,

26:35.762 --> 26:37.664
you should let him know
what's going on,

26:37.697 --> 26:39.031
'cause he's really anxious.

26:53.880 --> 26:55.147
Everything okay?

26:55.181 --> 26:58.217
Mateo's teachers talked
to Raf at drop-off.

26:58.250 --> 27:00.052
He needs to know
what's going on.

27:00.086 --> 27:02.321
We need to make a decision.

27:02.354 --> 27:04.056
So, we're
sleeping on it.

27:04.090 --> 27:06.793
Mm.
Uh, so what's-what's
going on here?

27:10.029 --> 27:11.998
Sofia, as in his
girlfriend before you?

27:14.033 --> 27:16.669
:
Oh.

27:25.211 --> 27:28.080
Do you regret that?

27:37.724 --> 27:39.826
What reason, Ma?

27:39.859 --> 27:41.828
And yes, I know
it was because

27:41.861 --> 27:44.030
you didn't love him
the way you loved Dad,

27:44.063 --> 27:45.865
but you knew that.

27:45.898 --> 27:47.266
You were gonna
say "yes" anyway.

27:47.299 --> 27:49.001
Why didn't you?

27:52.939 --> 27:54.173
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Blocked, as it were.

28:01.247 --> 28:03.149
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Yeah.

28:03.182 --> 28:05.217
There's a lot of that
going around.

28:05.251 --> 28:07.453
Love blocked.

28:07.486 --> 28:10.256
Writers blocked.

28:10.289 --> 28:13.893
Wow. I've never seen Jane
this frustrated.

28:13.926 --> 28:16.729
Ah, that makes more sense.

28:16.763 --> 28:20.066
Okay. Let's see
what she's written so far.

28:28.140 --> 28:30.743
J.R.

28:30.777 --> 28:32.945
What are you doing here?

28:32.979 --> 28:36.182
Jane. And I just
wanted to say thank you

28:36.215 --> 28:38.184
for getting that
appointment for my mother.

28:38.217 --> 28:41.120
It meant a lot.

28:41.153 --> 28:43.155
Well, you know,
sometimes you just...

28:43.189 --> 28:45.091
want to do nice things
for people

28:45.124 --> 28:47.459
without expecting
anything in return.

28:47.493 --> 28:49.829
Are you day drinking?

28:49.862 --> 28:52.131
And holding a séance?

28:53.365 --> 28:55.401
No. I'm writing my book.

28:55.434 --> 28:57.804
Well, I just
got the commission.

28:57.837 --> 28:59.071
It's a lifestyle book.

28:59.105 --> 29:01.073
The police are
investigating you for murder.

29:01.107 --> 29:03.442
You really think it's
a good idea to put out

29:03.475 --> 29:05.144
a lifestyle book?
You're gonna make
that whole murder thing

29:05.177 --> 29:06.813
go away because I didn't do it.

29:06.846 --> 29:08.147
You do know that, right?

29:08.180 --> 29:09.381
Because you have to trust me

29:09.415 --> 29:11.050
if you want to be my lawyer.

29:11.083 --> 29:12.852
Did you see that on TV, too?

29:12.885 --> 29:14.420
No.

29:16.088 --> 29:17.924
Maybe.

29:19.258 --> 29:21.794
So what are you gonna write
about your sister?

29:21.828 --> 29:23.362
In your book?

29:23.395 --> 29:24.964
If I'm going to talk
about my sister,

29:24.997 --> 29:26.265
I'm going
to need some more wine.

29:28.234 --> 29:30.903
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Petra, no! Stop!

29:30.937 --> 29:32.138
Don't let her in.

30:30.496 --> 30:32.398
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
All right.

30:32.431 --> 30:33.866
Tight, douchey shirts.

30:33.900 --> 30:35.868
Fifty Shades. Let's go!

30:38.337 --> 30:40.072
JANE:
Rafael, please take a seat.

30:44.043 --> 30:46.412
You're late to our meeting.

30:46.445 --> 30:48.347
Take off your shirt.

30:52.384 --> 30:54.053
Put that on.

30:57.456 --> 31:01.627
You've been a bad
administrative assistant.

31:04.997 --> 31:07.299
Lean over the desk.

31:09.368 --> 31:11.037
Yes. But.

31:11.070 --> 31:13.272
You. Know. Who's. Been.

31:13.305 --> 31:15.307
A. Good. Boy?

31:15.341 --> 31:18.210
Mateo.
No, stop talking
about Mateo.

31:18.244 --> 31:19.511
It isn't sexy or romantic.

31:19.545 --> 31:22.048
This is supposed to be sexy
and romantic.

31:22.081 --> 31:25.184
You know what I think
is sexy and romantic?

31:25.217 --> 31:26.919
The fact that I've been

31:26.953 --> 31:29.555
in every single one
of your fantasies.

31:29.588 --> 31:31.357
Clearly you can't get me
out of your head.

31:31.390 --> 31:33.325
But what does that mean?
Well, it means

31:33.359 --> 31:34.260
I'm your romantic hero.

31:34.293 --> 31:36.528
I may be a flawed hero,

31:36.562 --> 31:38.330
but I'm yours.

31:40.399 --> 31:42.234
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
And in that moment,

31:42.268 --> 31:45.337
Jane knew exactly
what she had to do.

31:48.374 --> 31:50.142
I think we should
give it a chance.

31:50.176 --> 31:51.610
Us a chance.

31:51.643 --> 31:53.145
I've been fighting
and fighting it,

31:53.179 --> 31:54.280
but it's in my heart

31:54.313 --> 31:57.283
and in my head, clearly.

31:57.316 --> 31:58.450
And...

31:58.484 --> 32:00.219
What?

32:00.252 --> 32:02.654
Um...

32:04.323 --> 32:06.325
I was gonna say
that you were right.

32:07.659 --> 32:10.262
Maybe I'm not
in the right headspace

32:10.296 --> 32:12.364
for a relationship.

32:19.405 --> 32:21.707
I guess I was just
looking around.

32:21.740 --> 32:22.574
At my place,

32:22.608 --> 32:25.011
at my life right now.

32:27.046 --> 32:29.081
I'm scared.

32:29.115 --> 32:31.150
Scared that this
is gonna last,

32:31.183 --> 32:34.353
that I'm gonna be stuck
in this tiny apartment

32:34.386 --> 32:36.355
where the hallway
has a weird...

32:36.388 --> 32:38.357
hotdog smell.

32:38.390 --> 32:40.359
And part of me just didn't want
to admit that to you because...

32:40.392 --> 32:43.329
I don't want you to
think I'm too dark.

32:43.362 --> 32:46.198
No hallway
should smell like that.

32:47.499 --> 32:50.102
You have to be able
to tell me the truth.

32:50.136 --> 32:52.404
I know.

32:52.438 --> 32:54.306
But I also know what
you're gonna say.

32:54.340 --> 32:55.574
Hmm?

32:55.607 --> 32:57.343
Money doesn't matter.

32:57.376 --> 32:59.511
Okay.

32:59.545 --> 33:01.247
Seriously?

33:01.280 --> 33:04.550
You think I don't have
big dreams for my life?

33:04.583 --> 33:08.054
You think I don't want
to write a best seller

33:08.087 --> 33:11.257
and make loads of cash
and buy a giant house?

33:11.290 --> 33:14.293
And one for my grandma. Oh.

33:14.326 --> 33:15.761
And a boat.

33:15.794 --> 33:16.728
A boat?
Hell yeah.

33:16.762 --> 33:18.464
In fact, I'm writing
some silly S and M book

33:18.497 --> 33:20.499
right now to get there.
S and M?

33:20.532 --> 33:22.368
Mm-hmm.
Wow.

33:22.401 --> 33:24.770
You are full of surprises.
What's the inspiration?

33:24.803 --> 33:26.205
Trying to guess what will sell.

33:26.238 --> 33:28.440
Ooh. Yeah, that won't work.

33:28.474 --> 33:30.109
You can't write if
you're not inspired.

33:30.142 --> 33:31.277
I might be able to.

33:31.310 --> 33:33.412
Mm-mm. Never.

33:33.445 --> 33:35.447
I know you.
Yeah.

33:35.481 --> 33:36.682
You do.

33:36.715 --> 33:38.317
You'll get an idea.

33:38.350 --> 33:39.485
Don't rush it.

33:39.518 --> 33:41.353
You have time.

33:41.387 --> 33:43.355
I wish we had time.

33:43.389 --> 33:44.423
But we don't.

33:44.456 --> 33:46.458
Mateo needs an answer.

33:48.160 --> 33:49.628
So...

33:49.661 --> 33:52.498
are we in a place right now

33:52.531 --> 33:55.301
to really be in a relationship?

33:55.334 --> 33:58.370
Like, fully in?

33:58.404 --> 33:59.505
RAMOS:
No.

33:59.538 --> 34:01.207
Oh, what's the big deal?

34:01.240 --> 34:03.709
The big deal is
it's not my name.

34:03.742 --> 34:05.311
And what is it
with this Jane?

34:05.344 --> 34:06.545
Are you in love with
her or something?

34:06.578 --> 34:08.080
:
What? No.

34:08.114 --> 34:10.282
Then why are you obsessed
with her?

34:10.316 --> 34:11.283
I'm not.

34:12.251 --> 34:13.485
Okay, fine.
Maybe now,

34:13.519 --> 34:15.421
but that's
just because...

34:15.454 --> 34:17.323
well, because...

34:19.391 --> 34:21.660
...because she's mad at me.

34:22.661 --> 34:24.563
Are you okay?

34:24.596 --> 34:26.632
:
I'm fine. Sorry.

34:28.667 --> 34:30.802
'Cause this is a
lot more emotion

34:30.836 --> 34:33.739
than you showed about
your sister, who's dead.

34:33.772 --> 34:36.342
My sister was awful.

34:36.375 --> 34:39.511
Jane's a good person.

34:39.545 --> 34:42.281
So if she's
done with me...

34:42.314 --> 34:44.116
I must be awful.

34:44.150 --> 34:46.752
You're not awful.

34:46.785 --> 34:49.455
I hardly know you,

34:49.488 --> 34:52.324
and you got my mom
in to see a doctor.

34:52.358 --> 34:54.560
Well, 'cause Jane said I see
relationships as transactional.

34:54.593 --> 34:56.262
I was trying to
prove her wrong.

34:56.295 --> 34:58.464
Yeah, that makes more sense.

35:00.499 --> 35:02.568
Look, um...

35:02.601 --> 35:05.504
everybody has
ulterior motives.

35:05.537 --> 35:07.306
That's not a bad thing.

35:07.339 --> 35:08.707
I mean, you really think

35:08.740 --> 35:10.509
I came over with
a bottle of wine

35:10.542 --> 35:12.211
just to say thank you?

35:12.244 --> 35:13.412
You didn't?

35:13.445 --> 35:16.515
Yeah, that was part of it.

35:16.548 --> 35:19.185
But I also want
the blueprints.

35:19.218 --> 35:20.919
Because I need you

35:20.952 --> 35:22.554
to trust me, too.

35:22.588 --> 35:24.523
You're relentless.

35:24.556 --> 35:26.258
Without a doubt.

35:26.292 --> 35:27.559
Look, whatever your beef is

35:27.593 --> 35:29.361
with this other Jane...

35:30.262 --> 35:32.864
...just don't take no
for an answer.

35:32.898 --> 35:35.234
JANE:
Petra?

35:35.267 --> 35:36.435
W

35:36.468 --> 35:37.403
You can't cancel brunch.

35:37.436 --> 35:38.704
Have a seat, girls.

35:38.737 --> 35:40.839
Um, what's going on?

35:40.872 --> 35:42.441
It's brunch.

35:42.474 --> 35:44.443
And I need to make things right
between us,

35:44.476 --> 35:45.544
so I'm here
to cook everyone

35:45.577 --> 35:46.545
a traditional Czech breakfast.

35:46.578 --> 35:48.314
Alba, any food intolerances?

35:48.347 --> 35:49.715
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
No intolerances for the food.

35:49.748 --> 35:50.949
Just the company.

35:50.982 --> 35:52.484
No.

35:52.518 --> 35:54.753
Petra, I don't think...
Jane, do you really

35:54.786 --> 35:56.722
want to kick me out in
front of the children?

36:04.830 --> 36:06.565
What is this really about?

36:06.598 --> 36:08.667
Do you want me to help you
make things right

36:08.700 --> 36:10.436
with Rafael?
Rafael?

36:10.469 --> 36:12.438
No, I can win
him back in my sleep.

36:12.471 --> 36:13.872
I've done way worse to him.

36:13.905 --> 36:16.808
Oh.
No, the truth is...

36:16.842 --> 36:19.511
if you and I aren't okay,
I know something's really wrong.

36:19.545 --> 36:21.513
Because you're kind of...

36:21.547 --> 36:23.415
my...

36:24.616 --> 36:27.453
...moral compass.

36:27.486 --> 36:29.655
And I can always tell
exactly how far I've strayed

36:29.688 --> 36:30.989
from what's right by how big

36:31.022 --> 36:32.891
your reaction is
to what I've done.

36:32.924 --> 36:35.527
So I know I have to do
some course correcting,

36:35.561 --> 36:37.596
and I plan to.

36:39.265 --> 36:40.499
Appreciate that.

36:40.532 --> 36:42.534
Good.

36:42.568 --> 36:44.570
And regardless,
you can't cancel brunch.

36:44.603 --> 36:45.904
It happens

36:45.937 --> 36:47.506
with or without Rafael.

36:49.708 --> 36:52.278
'Cause it was never about him.

36:52.311 --> 36:55.547
So, let's check in
on each other, okay?

36:55.581 --> 36:56.648
Once a week.

36:56.682 --> 36:58.750
You don't have to do this.

36:58.784 --> 37:01.353
I don't like
to be pitied, okay?

37:01.387 --> 37:02.621
Are you serious?

37:04.022 --> 37:06.425
Don't make me pull
the widow card.

37:06.458 --> 37:08.594
I need this, too. Okay?

37:11.763 --> 37:13.565
ROGELIO:
The truth is,

37:13.599 --> 37:15.634
it isn't for me.

37:15.667 --> 37:18.003
And so... I've decided.

37:18.036 --> 37:20.339
It's time to go back to work.

37:20.372 --> 37:22.308
Okay, how was that?

37:22.341 --> 37:23.642
Be completely honest.

37:23.675 --> 37:25.444
You're right.

37:25.477 --> 37:27.379
I have nothing to be ashamed of.

37:27.413 --> 37:29.515
Here she is.

37:29.548 --> 37:32.918
The dance studio mogul!

37:32.951 --> 37:35.521
Yeah, about that.

37:35.554 --> 37:37.789
I've decided
to close the studio.

37:37.823 --> 37:41.660
What? I-I thought you signed up
enough students.

37:41.693 --> 37:43.962
I'm just not happy, Rogelio,

37:43.995 --> 37:45.797
and I've known that for a while.

37:45.831 --> 37:48.500
But I've been putting
so much pressure on myself,

37:48.534 --> 37:49.635
trying to force it to work

37:49.668 --> 37:51.337
because I didn't want
to be a quitter.

37:51.370 --> 37:53.772
I know that feeling.

37:53.805 --> 37:56.308
Yeah. And then,
I talked to my mom,

37:56.342 --> 37:58.777
and she made me realize
I'm not quitting.

37:58.810 --> 38:01.580
It's not like it's been
three days or three weeks.

38:01.613 --> 38:03.882
I've given it three years.

38:03.915 --> 38:06.785
And a manager
from the local Stage Sensations

38:06.818 --> 38:08.720
came to spy on
the open house,

38:08.754 --> 38:10.856
so I reached out
to him today,

38:10.889 --> 38:12.891
and he offered me
a teaching job.

38:12.924 --> 38:16.428
And honestly,
I feel so liberated.

38:16.462 --> 38:20.332
Well, that's wonderful, Xiomara.

38:20.366 --> 38:21.867
Well, you inspired me

38:21.900 --> 38:23.935
by making your own
career change.

38:23.969 --> 38:25.971
It's never too late to commit

38:26.004 --> 38:27.806
to something new, right, Danny?

38:27.839 --> 38:28.940
PETRA:
No!

38:28.974 --> 38:30.041
It's not too late.

38:30.075 --> 38:31.109
You can take this Sofia down,

38:31.142 --> 38:32.911
I'm sure of it.
No.

38:32.944 --> 38:34.480
Oh, please, own your hotness.

38:34.513 --> 38:35.714
Mmm, amen.

38:35.747 --> 38:37.449
That's what I've
been telling her.

38:37.483 --> 38:38.817
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Wow,
this brunch is going great.

38:38.850 --> 38:39.985
Seriously,
you're a ten in my book.

38:40.018 --> 38:41.353
ELSA:
Yeah.

38:41.387 --> 38:42.421
Mommy's writing a book.

38:43.589 --> 38:46.458
Oh. No, no, that's, that's
not what I was talking...

38:46.492 --> 38:47.826
My mommy's writing
a book, too-- or trying to.

38:49.160 --> 38:50.829
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Can you blame me?

38:50.862 --> 38:52.364
Yeah, I'm just having

38:52.398 --> 38:53.599
a little writer's block
right now.

38:53.632 --> 38:54.933
Totally. Me, too.

38:54.966 --> 38:56.768
It's the worst, right?

38:56.802 --> 38:58.737
Yeah.

38:58.770 --> 39:00.506
Yours is a little
different, though,

39:00.539 --> 39:02.608
because you're not
a writer, so...

39:02.641 --> 39:04.476
I knew you were mad about that.

39:04.510 --> 39:05.377
I'm not mad.

39:06.545 --> 39:07.513
I'm just flummoxed.

39:07.546 --> 39:08.914
PETRA:
Well, I write every day.

39:08.947 --> 39:10.882
You know? Yeah. Presentations,

39:10.916 --> 39:13.785
letters, e-mails.
I mean, I stay at
a lot of hotels.

39:13.819 --> 39:14.886
Doesn't mean
I can run one.

39:14.920 --> 39:16.455
PETRA:
Fine.

39:16.488 --> 39:18.457
If I admit it's really hard,
will you be happy?

39:19.491 --> 39:20.992
A little, yeah.

39:21.026 --> 39:22.528
It is.

39:22.561 --> 39:23.829
And I don't know what I'm doing.

39:23.862 --> 39:27.032
Don't repeat that.

39:27.065 --> 39:29.000
Thanks for saying that.

39:29.034 --> 39:30.902
And get a ghostwriter.

39:30.936 --> 39:32.070
What?

39:32.103 --> 39:33.905
To help you write your book.

39:33.939 --> 39:37.476
Where on earth am I supposed
to find someone who I trust,

39:37.509 --> 39:39.044
who knows me really well,

39:39.077 --> 39:41.613
who understands my background
and my day-to-day life,

39:41.647 --> 39:44.550
and who just happens
to be a talented writer?

39:44.583 --> 39:46.184
Jane, would you ghostwrite
my book?

39:48.086 --> 39:49.888
I-I don't think that's
a really good...

39:49.921 --> 39:51.657
I'll pay you $150 an hour.

39:53.692 --> 39:55.761
$300.

39:57.596 --> 39:58.964
No more than a hundred hours.

39:58.997 --> 40:01.032
150.

40:01.066 --> 40:02.768
Deal.

40:02.801 --> 40:03.835
KIDS:
Yay!

40:03.869 --> 40:05.871
NARRATOR:
What could go wrong?

40:05.904 --> 40:07.706
So, yes.

40:07.739 --> 40:10.041
Jane and I made up,
so thank you.

40:10.075 --> 40:11.910
And, yes.

40:11.943 --> 40:13.979
We'll turn over
those blueprints, J.R.

40:14.012 --> 40:15.213
RAMOS:
That's great.

40:15.246 --> 40:16.515
I'll let the detectives know

40:16.548 --> 40:17.783
you're cooperating, Peter.

40:44.710 --> 40:46.678
You ready to go
to the doctor's, Mom?

40:46.712 --> 40:49.114
What doctor?

40:49.147 --> 40:52.851
I got you in
to see a specialist.

40:55.053 --> 40:57.589
To try to help with your memory.

40:58.724 --> 41:00.859
JANE:
Everything is so complicated.

41:00.892 --> 41:02.828
There are so many sides
to consider,

41:02.861 --> 41:05.497
and we've thought
about everything.

41:05.531 --> 41:06.765
And we made a decision.

41:06.798 --> 41:08.634
RAFAEL:
And...

41:08.667 --> 41:11.870
we just want to go
back to being friends.

41:11.903 --> 41:13.672
And family.

41:15.674 --> 41:16.775
And that means
no more kissing,

41:16.808 --> 41:19.210
no more exploring.

41:19.244 --> 41:22.914
And... we both made
this decision.

41:22.948 --> 41:24.249
Okay?

41:29.287 --> 41:31.222
It's the right thing
to do, right?

41:31.256 --> 41:33.625
Yes. Absolutely.

41:36.862 --> 41:38.864
*

41:40.331 --> 41:41.833
It was the only way
to give ourselves time

41:41.867 --> 41:42.634
without outside pressure.

41:42.668 --> 41:45.136
Exactly.
We can just take it slow.

41:45.170 --> 41:47.939
Wait. We are gonna
have sex, right?

41:47.973 --> 41:49.808
Oh, yeah. We're gonna have
a lot of sex.
