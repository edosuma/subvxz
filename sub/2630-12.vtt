WEBVTT

00:02.377 --> 00:03.836
Come on, Joey!

00:04.003 --> 00:06.380
Rach, I told you everything I knew
last night.

00:06.589 --> 00:10.300
It's not that big a deal.
So Monica and Chandler are doing it.

00:10.468 --> 00:13.137
I cannot believe you would say that!

00:13.346 --> 00:17.057
Sorry. Monica and Chandler
are "making love."

00:18.184 --> 00:21.854
No, I mean, come on.
This is a huge deal!

00:22.063 --> 00:25.065
I need more details.
Who initiated the first kiss?

00:25.692 --> 00:27.484
I don't know.

00:28.361 --> 00:30.404
Is he romantic with her?

00:31.031 --> 00:32.698
I don't know.

00:33.908 --> 00:35.200
Are they in love?

00:36.286 --> 00:38.037
- I don't know.
- Ugh.

00:38.830 --> 00:40.330
You don't know anything.

00:40.498 --> 00:42.249
- Oh! I know one thing.
- What?

00:42.417 --> 00:44.710
They did it right there on the couch.

01:35.929 --> 01:38.263
- Hey, Ross.
- Yeah.

01:38.932 --> 01:41.225
Gunther, could I have a scone, please?

01:41.392 --> 01:42.976
Want to hear some good news?

01:43.186 --> 01:44.770
Someone I know is getting married.

01:44.938 --> 01:48.982
Yeah, weddings are happy occasions.
Oh, by the by, it's my ex-wife, Emily!

01:50.735 --> 01:51.985
Sorry, man.

01:52.153 --> 01:54.863
- Here's your scone.
- Thanks, Gunther.

01:55.406 --> 01:56.448
Thanks.

01:56.908 --> 01:59.535
Stupid British snack food!

02:01.329 --> 02:03.872
Did they teach you that
in anger management?

02:05.542 --> 02:08.377
You know what might help deal with it?
Think of it this way.

02:08.544 --> 02:12.005
You and Emily are in the past.
You can't be mad about the past.

02:12.173 --> 02:16.009
Are you still mad about, you know,
the Louisiana Purchase?

02:17.929 --> 02:22.266
- I don't think anybody's mad about that.
- Exactly! Because it's in the past.

02:25.478 --> 02:27.271
Anybody going to eat that?

02:31.526 --> 02:35.320
Look at us all dressed up for the party.
What are we celebrating?

02:35.530 --> 02:38.323
We had a lot of liquor
left over from the Christmas party.

02:39.242 --> 02:41.577
I think this is cool.
None of our friends are here.

02:41.744 --> 02:43.996
We can be a real couple.
We don't have to hide.

02:44.164 --> 02:46.874
- I know. I can do this.
- Ooh.

02:47.041 --> 02:48.750
And I can do this.

02:50.503 --> 02:52.296
- We can't do that.
- We can't do that.

02:53.298 --> 02:55.799
Hey, Bing! Ha-ha-ha.

02:56.467 --> 03:00.012
Whoa! Who's the pretty lady,
and what is she doing with you?

03:00.180 --> 03:03.849
Ha-ha-ha! I ask myself that very question.
This is Monica.

03:04.017 --> 03:06.852
- My boss, Doug. This is Monica.
- Hi, nice to meet you.

03:07.020 --> 03:09.646
- Hi! This is my wife, Kara.
- Nice to meet you.

03:09.814 --> 03:11.148
- Bing!
- Okay!

03:12.609 --> 03:14.985
Did you hear about the new law firm
working for us?

03:15.153 --> 03:17.029
- No, sir.
- Yeah, Dewey, Cheatem & Howe.

03:21.534 --> 03:23.452
Come on, let's go drink our body weight.

03:25.955 --> 03:27.372
- What was that?
- What?

03:27.540 --> 03:28.707
That noise you made?

03:28.875 --> 03:31.877
- Oh, that was my work laugh.
- Your work laugh?

03:32.086 --> 03:36.006
If you're going to survive this party,
you have to come up with one too.

03:36.549 --> 03:39.426
- All right. Check me out.
- Okay.

03:39.594 --> 03:42.471
He says, "$30, Father.
Same as in town." Ha!

03:49.187 --> 03:52.522
Hey, everybody at work
loved you last night.

03:52.690 --> 03:54.233
- Really?
- And they like me more...

03:54.400 --> 03:55.943
...just because I was with you.

03:56.110 --> 03:59.112
You repaired a lot of the damage
from when they met Joey.

04:00.949 --> 04:04.451
Doug wants us to play tennis.
He's never talked to me outside of work.

04:04.619 --> 04:07.037
Except for that time
at that strip club.

04:09.457 --> 04:11.041
Strip church.

04:13.211 --> 04:16.046
- I'm gonna go try to find a racket.
- I thought you had one.

04:16.214 --> 04:20.300
I used to, but then Joey thought it'd be fun
to go to Central Park and hit rocks...

04:20.551 --> 04:22.219
...at bigger rocks.

04:23.096 --> 04:25.430
- Hey, Rach, do you have a tennis racket?
- Hey.

04:25.598 --> 04:28.392
Oh, um, I lent it to Joey
and I've never gotten it back.

04:29.477 --> 04:30.686
Okay, good luck with that.

04:33.523 --> 04:35.023
- Ahem. Hey.
- Hey.

04:35.191 --> 04:36.400
What's up?

04:36.567 --> 04:39.278
What are you doing here?
I thought you had inventory.

04:39.445 --> 04:41.863
Well I do, but I decided I'd take
a long lunch...

04:42.031 --> 04:44.616
...and spend some time
with my friend, Monica.

04:45.827 --> 04:48.453
You know, I feel like
we don't talk anymore.

04:48.621 --> 04:50.122
How are you?

04:50.290 --> 04:51.790
What is new with you?

04:53.376 --> 04:55.168
Heh, um...

04:55.336 --> 04:57.629
Not much. Um, work's good.

04:57.797 --> 05:00.924
We don't have to talk about work.
We could talk about anything.

05:02.051 --> 05:03.593
Okay. Um...

05:03.761 --> 05:05.554
Hey! You know what?

05:06.347 --> 05:07.931
Let's talk about relationships.

05:08.141 --> 05:11.143
- Okay. What's going on with you?
- Nothing.

05:12.395 --> 05:13.812
You go.

05:14.564 --> 05:17.399
Well, I... There was this guy at the bank
that I thought was cute.

05:17.567 --> 05:19.609
Um, but I don't anymore.

05:20.987 --> 05:23.697
Wow, that's, uh, juicy. Ahem, um...

05:23.865 --> 05:27.159
You know what? I actually do
have a lot of work to do.

05:27.327 --> 05:30.746
You're sure there's just
not anything else?

05:30.913 --> 05:34.499
Yes, I'm sure. Is there something
you want to talk to me about?

05:34.667 --> 05:35.917
No.

05:38.588 --> 05:40.297
I...

05:40.465 --> 05:42.507
If there was, I wouldn't tell you.

05:50.433 --> 05:51.767
Okay, then what happened?

05:52.518 --> 05:55.020
Uh, oh! Aw.

05:55.188 --> 05:56.563
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

05:57.982 --> 05:59.900
Ah-ah, you'll get your turn.

06:00.401 --> 06:02.903
- Hey, Pheebs. What's going on?
- Hey. Nothing.

06:03.404 --> 06:04.446
This is not over.

06:05.615 --> 06:07.699
- No, no, no!
- What?

06:07.867 --> 06:11.244
Ugh, I was up all night writing
this really nasty letter to Emily.

06:11.412 --> 06:14.373
It was perfect,
and now it's all covered in...

06:14.540 --> 06:16.249
Actually, thanks!

06:17.043 --> 06:19.086
All right!
Everybody ready to go to the movies?

06:19.253 --> 06:22.172
Uh, actually, I think I'm gonna skip it.

06:22.340 --> 06:24.633
- Really?
- I'm gonna stay and read my book.

06:24.801 --> 06:26.593
I just want to be alone right now.

06:26.761 --> 06:28.345
Oh. Sure you don't want to come?

06:28.513 --> 06:32.682
Tom Hanks, Meg Ryan.
They get mail and stuff.

06:34.477 --> 06:35.894
- That's okay, Joe.
- All right.

06:36.062 --> 06:37.687
Let's go, Pheebs.

06:40.483 --> 06:42.109
Oh, God!

06:46.906 --> 06:48.448
Bing!

06:51.202 --> 06:53.078
- Unh!
- Aah!

06:53.579 --> 06:54.871
Game!

06:56.666 --> 07:00.210
Yeah, I gotta tell you,
that partner of yours is a real tiger.

07:01.629 --> 07:03.171
Are you all right?

07:05.466 --> 07:07.884
We'll just get
a little sip of water.

07:09.679 --> 07:12.389
Am I on fire today or what?

07:12.640 --> 07:16.726
Those birds are browned,
basted and ready to be carved.

07:17.645 --> 07:19.396
Okay, easy, Martina.

07:21.149 --> 07:23.692
I think we should let them
win the next game.

07:23.901 --> 07:26.862
I'm sorry, I don't understand
what you just said.

07:28.197 --> 07:29.239
Let them win one.

07:29.490 --> 07:33.660
Are you crazy? We own those two.
Look at them!

07:33.995 --> 07:36.955
He can't even breathe,
and she's popping pills.

07:38.082 --> 07:39.749
You're not giving them a chance.

07:39.959 --> 07:41.460
They have rackets, don't they?

07:43.588 --> 07:46.756
Uh, Bing, I think we're gonna
make this the last game.

07:47.008 --> 07:48.967
Yes, sir. Put me out of my misery.

07:49.177 --> 07:51.720
Are you sure you never played pro?
Ha-ha-ha.

07:51.888 --> 07:53.096
Please let them win.

07:53.264 --> 07:56.975
I'll take it down to 95 percent,
but that's the best I can do.

08:02.482 --> 08:04.649
- Oopsie! Missed it!
- I got it!

08:08.446 --> 08:09.529
Nice shot.

08:19.040 --> 08:20.540
I got it!

08:21.542 --> 08:23.126
Long!

08:29.509 --> 08:31.468
I can't believe you let them win.

08:31.636 --> 08:34.929
Yeah, well, at least you hid
your feelings well about it.

08:35.597 --> 08:37.890
- I was frustrated.
- It was my racket.

08:38.058 --> 08:39.351
I was frustrated with you!

08:39.519 --> 08:44.147
If we hadn't lost, they would never have
invited us to dinner tomorrow.

08:44.357 --> 08:45.482
What bothers me...

08:45.650 --> 08:48.068
...is how different
you act around them.

08:48.319 --> 08:51.196
The throwing the tennis games,
the fake laugh...

08:51.405 --> 08:54.241
...the "See you later, Bing!"
"Not if I see you first, Doug!"

08:57.870 --> 09:00.664
I don't like "work Chandler."
The guy's a suck-up.

09:01.415 --> 09:03.291
You know what?
Because you said that...

09:03.501 --> 09:05.377
...I'm not putting out tonight!

09:12.760 --> 09:15.887
Something's wrong.
My brother does not stay out all night.

09:16.055 --> 09:18.181
Maybe we should check
the trash chute.

09:19.809 --> 09:22.143
Ross couldn't fit
down the trash chute.

09:22.353 --> 09:24.604
That's right. He almost could.

09:24.855 --> 09:27.315
Which is exactly
how I got stuck there.

09:28.985 --> 09:30.360
- Hey!
- Hey.

09:30.528 --> 09:32.070
Oh, my God!

09:32.780 --> 09:34.447
Where the hell have you been?

09:35.283 --> 09:37.534
Just, you know, out.

09:37.743 --> 09:42.289
Oh, out! God, I don't know
why we didn't think to check there.

09:42.665 --> 09:43.999
What were you doing?

09:44.208 --> 09:47.002
I, uh, went to a bar and then...

09:47.253 --> 09:50.630
...I just, uh, walked around for a while.

09:50.923 --> 09:54.050
You walked around all night
in the city by yourself?

09:55.845 --> 09:57.095
He hooked up!

09:59.056 --> 10:00.390
He hooked up with someone.

10:00.600 --> 10:03.810
I don't have to answer your questions.
Okay? I'm a big boy.

10:04.020 --> 10:05.353
I can do whatever I want.

10:05.563 --> 10:06.813
He hooked up!

10:09.066 --> 10:11.067
Tell us about her!

10:11.861 --> 10:13.403
Ross, you left your scarf...

10:21.245 --> 10:22.454
Hey, you guys.

10:30.963 --> 10:33.089
Okay. Okay.

10:33.257 --> 10:37.177
I know what you all are thinking,
but Chandler is in Yemen.

10:38.929 --> 10:42.223
I'm a young woman. I have needs.
I can't wait forever.

10:42.391 --> 10:44.476
Yeah, no, that's what I was thinking.

10:46.520 --> 10:50.857
So I'm asking you, please
just take a moment before you judge me.

10:51.025 --> 10:52.359
Oh, nobody's judging you.

10:53.361 --> 10:54.694
Oh.

10:54.862 --> 10:58.365
Okay, you,
Mr. Right-place-at-the-right-time...

11:00.493 --> 11:01.701
...call me.

11:10.503 --> 11:13.004
Okay, look,
I know what you guys are going to say.

11:13.214 --> 11:15.840
You two would have
very hairy children.

11:17.593 --> 11:19.427
I didn't know you'd say that.

11:20.513 --> 11:22.472
Ross! Janice?

11:22.682 --> 11:24.599
All right. Hold on, hold on, hold on.

11:24.850 --> 11:26.643
This is Ross. Okay?

11:26.852 --> 11:30.021
He's our friend.
He obviously went crazy.

11:30.231 --> 11:32.232
He obviously lost his mind.

11:32.483 --> 11:36.736
I didn't lose my mind, okay?
Janice and I have a lot in common.

11:36.987 --> 11:41.116
We've both been divorced.
We both have kids.

11:41.325 --> 11:43.243
Are you going to see her again?

11:43.452 --> 11:46.246
- Don't put ideas in his head!
- I am gonna see her again.

11:46.455 --> 11:48.498
Damn it, Phoebe!

11:52.795 --> 11:55.964
I have to tell you something
that I've never admitted.

11:56.132 --> 12:00.343
In high school, I made out with James
even though I knew that you liked him.

12:00.511 --> 12:03.805
Wow! That feels so good
to get off my chest. Okay, you go.

12:05.349 --> 12:07.892
- My turn? What are you talking about?
- Ugh.

12:08.102 --> 12:09.352
Monica...

12:10.354 --> 12:12.313
I know about you and Chandler.

12:13.441 --> 12:14.482
What?

12:14.650 --> 12:17.026
I overheard you
on the phone the other day.

12:17.194 --> 12:21.531
You said, "I'll tell Rachel I'm doing
laundry for a couple of hours."

12:21.741 --> 12:24.784
And he said, "Laundry?
Is that my new nickname?"

12:24.952 --> 12:26.870
And you said, "No.

12:27.037 --> 12:31.040
You know what
your nickname is, Mr. Big."

12:35.171 --> 12:36.588
Well, heh...

12:36.756 --> 12:39.591
Sounds like you're writing yourself
a little play there, Rach.

12:41.427 --> 12:44.304
Wow, I... Let me know how
that one turns out.

12:44.472 --> 12:48.975
I wouldn't know because I got
so freaked out I hung up the phone.

12:49.143 --> 12:51.603
Well, if you had kept listening, ha-ha-ha...

12:51.854 --> 12:55.565
...you would have heard me
call him Mister Big...

12:55.733 --> 12:57.650
...ot.
- What?

12:57.818 --> 12:59.611
Mr. Bigot.

13:00.738 --> 13:04.574
Ha, ha. He tells the most racist jokes.

13:05.826 --> 13:08.077
All right. So that's it.

13:08.329 --> 13:11.956
You're telling me there's nothing going on
between you and Chandler?

13:12.291 --> 13:14.167
Me and Chandler?

13:19.089 --> 13:20.548
- Put your $20 down.
- Okay.

13:20.716 --> 13:22.967
First one to find the tasty treat wins.

13:23.135 --> 13:24.844
- Okay? All right.
- Mm-hm.

13:25.012 --> 13:28.264
Let's get the contestants
out of their isolation booths.

13:29.391 --> 13:30.850
And they're off!

13:31.268 --> 13:32.435
Whoa.

13:32.603 --> 13:34.771
Get your foot off my contestant!
Judge?

13:34.980 --> 13:36.940
Judge rules no violation.

13:37.107 --> 13:38.191
Agh.

13:39.193 --> 13:40.944
- Hey, guys.
- Yeah.

13:42.112 --> 13:46.324
It's so weird to say this,
but I just had a great date with Janice.

13:46.534 --> 13:48.076
- What?
- Are you serious?

13:48.244 --> 13:52.914
Yeah. I opened up to her about all the
terrible stuff that's been happening to me.

13:53.082 --> 13:55.208
I mean, I talked for hours.

13:55.376 --> 13:56.501
It is amazing...

13:56.710 --> 14:00.296
...to have someone give you
such focused attention.

14:00.464 --> 14:03.466
You don't need Janice for that.
You've got us.

14:03.634 --> 14:06.719
- And the duck gets the Nutter Butter!
- No! Agh!

14:06.887 --> 14:09.597
That's not a Nutter Butter.
That's an old won ton!

14:09.849 --> 14:11.099
Judge rules...

14:11.392 --> 14:13.393
...Nutter Butter.
- Ugh.

14:13.561 --> 14:15.061
- Tough call.
- Yeah.

14:19.608 --> 14:24.028
Seriously, I strongly believe that
we should all support President Clinton...

14:24.363 --> 14:25.530
...and her husband, Bill.

14:29.243 --> 14:31.035
So how do you like your coffee?

14:31.203 --> 14:33.246
- None for me.
- Just a little bit of sugar.

14:33.414 --> 14:35.456
I'll have Monica stick her finger in it.

14:35.624 --> 14:37.000
That ought to sweeten it up.

14:41.589 --> 14:44.465
- How does that not give you a headache?
- You get used to it.

14:44.633 --> 14:46.134
I don't think that I can.

14:46.302 --> 14:48.803
Maybe this will be it for me
on the work things.

14:48.971 --> 14:51.431
So I laugh at my boss's jokes.
What's the big deal?

14:51.599 --> 14:54.142
I'd rather not hang out with
this work-weasel guy...

14:54.310 --> 14:57.645
...when I could be with my boyfriend,
who I actually respect.

14:57.813 --> 14:59.147
Oh.

15:00.566 --> 15:01.858
Ah, heh.

15:02.026 --> 15:04.319
I gotta apologize for Kara's coffee.

15:04.486 --> 15:06.487
I'd feel sorry for it if it got in a fight.

15:06.655 --> 15:10.533
It's not strong enough
to defend itself. Ha-ha-ha!

15:13.621 --> 15:14.913
Hear what I said?

15:15.915 --> 15:17.081
What?

15:18.042 --> 15:20.418
It's a joke, Bing.
What's the matter with you?

15:20.586 --> 15:23.671
Well, I just didn't think
it was funny, sir.

15:23.881 --> 15:24.923
Excuse me?

15:26.383 --> 15:28.384
- Well, I just...
- Honey?

15:28.761 --> 15:31.095
I just don't think
you understood the joke.

15:32.222 --> 15:33.723
- Really?
- Yeah.

15:33.891 --> 15:37.310
I mean, it was really funny.
I just don't think that you got it.

15:37.478 --> 15:41.064
Heh, you see,
Kara's coffee is weak-tasting.

15:41.231 --> 15:45.193
But what Doug did was imply
that it was weak physically.

15:47.780 --> 15:49.614
- You get it now, honey?
- I think I do!

15:54.578 --> 15:57.080
- Thank you, Monica.
- I thought you could use the help.

15:57.247 --> 15:58.831
Ha-ha-ha.

15:58.999 --> 16:00.416
Coffee in a fight!

16:05.214 --> 16:06.381
Hey, Rach.

16:06.548 --> 16:09.050
You mind if I read
my comic books in here?

16:11.011 --> 16:13.638
Sure. Why?

16:13.806 --> 16:17.809
Chandler and Monica are over there.
It's kind of hard to concentrate.

16:18.852 --> 16:22.438
What? She just called and said
she was going to be working late.

16:22.648 --> 16:24.399
She keeps lying to me.

16:24.608 --> 16:28.653
That's it! I'm gonna go over there
and I'm confronting them right now.

16:39.373 --> 16:43.459
So you're telling me
that I have to tell racist jokes now?

16:44.503 --> 16:46.504
I'm just not very good at this.

16:46.714 --> 16:49.590
I'm a terrible liar.
I hate having to lie to Rachel.

16:49.758 --> 16:52.552
- But we're not ready to tell yet.
- I know.

16:52.720 --> 16:57.473
Ever since high school, Rachel was
the one person that I told everything to.

16:57.641 --> 16:59.892
I miss that so much now.

17:00.060 --> 17:02.437
She's my best friend.

17:09.111 --> 17:10.278
Joey?

17:11.405 --> 17:12.989
- Oh, my God, Rachel!
- Hey!

17:13.156 --> 17:14.866
Hi!

17:16.452 --> 17:18.368
What are you doing here?

17:19.829 --> 17:23.958
Well, I actually came over here
to borrow this lamp...

17:24.209 --> 17:26.711
...to, um, look at my books.

17:27.003 --> 17:28.963
You know, see them a little better. Heh.

17:30.591 --> 17:33.593
- Okay, great. Great. Um...
- Yeah.

17:33.886 --> 17:37.305
Well, what I was doing
in Chandler's room is that, um...

17:37.556 --> 17:38.848
...I was cleaning it.

17:40.267 --> 17:42.810
- In fact, he pays me to clean it.
- Oh!

17:42.978 --> 17:46.439
What a great way to make
some extra pocket money.

17:47.775 --> 17:51.027
When I said to you earlier
that I was at work, um...

17:51.236 --> 17:52.945
...I'm at my new work.

17:53.572 --> 17:55.907
Good enough. Right?

17:57.117 --> 17:59.035
Okay, well, um...

17:59.661 --> 18:01.329
I'm gonna go look at my books.

18:02.539 --> 18:05.833
- Okay. Go get back to my new job.
- Okay.

18:07.461 --> 18:08.795
Okay.

18:11.965 --> 18:14.342
Congratulations on your new job!

18:21.350 --> 18:22.892
Man, she is really gullible.

18:29.691 --> 18:31.818
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

18:32.069 --> 18:34.612
- Actually, I should get going.
- You're sure?

18:34.863 --> 18:37.073
I can stay out as late as you want.

18:37.241 --> 18:39.367
I told you I'm on
sabbatical from work...

18:39.576 --> 18:42.537
Yes, yes. You did. Ha-ha-ha.

18:42.704 --> 18:45.081
- Oh, man!
- What is wrong now?

18:46.083 --> 18:48.167
This isn't what I ordered.

18:48.377 --> 18:52.547
Man! Can't anything
go right in my life?

18:53.173 --> 18:56.259
First, my marriage falls apart,
and then...

18:56.426 --> 18:57.593
I know, I know!

18:57.803 --> 19:00.555
You lose your apartment,
then you lose your job...

19:00.722 --> 19:03.766
...then your ex-wife gets married so fast!
And now the coffee!

19:03.934 --> 19:05.518
Aah!

19:06.103 --> 19:07.395
Ross...

19:07.563 --> 19:10.314
...we need to talk.
- Okay.

19:10.482 --> 19:13.734
- Sometimes I feel...
- No, no, don't.

19:13.944 --> 19:15.903
I'm going to talk.

19:16.822 --> 19:18.239
I believe...

19:18.490 --> 19:21.325
...that the sun has set...

19:21.535 --> 19:24.787
...on our day in the sun.

19:25.998 --> 19:30.710
- What?
- You're a very sweet person, Ross.

19:31.044 --> 19:32.753
Um...

19:33.463 --> 19:34.714
Unfortunately...

19:35.048 --> 19:39.093
...I just don't think I can take
another second of you whining!

19:42.055 --> 19:45.516
Let me make sure
I'm hearing this right.

19:46.643 --> 19:50.146
You're ending this with me because...

19:50.397 --> 19:51.939
...I'm too whiny?

19:52.107 --> 19:53.441
Mm.

19:55.319 --> 19:57.111
So you're saying...

19:57.362 --> 20:00.531
...I've become so whiny...

20:00.782 --> 20:02.450
...that I...

20:02.659 --> 20:05.328
...annoy you...

20:06.538 --> 20:08.164
...Janice.

20:08.498 --> 20:09.749
Well, yeah!

20:10.000 --> 20:12.543
Oh, my God!

20:15.422 --> 20:18.716
- Are you gonna be okay?
- I am now.

20:18.884 --> 20:20.301
Okay.

20:26.141 --> 20:27.308
- Hi.
- Oh, hi.

20:28.644 --> 20:29.769
Well...

20:30.604 --> 20:32.647
I guess, that's two out of three...

20:33.774 --> 20:34.815
...Joey!

20:45.661 --> 20:48.746
- Dude, we gotta talk.
- Okay.

20:48.914 --> 20:52.708
I want to tell you something before
you heard it from someone else.

20:52.960 --> 20:56.379
I hope this isn't too weird but, uh...

20:57.339 --> 20:59.924
...I had a thing with Janice.

21:04.763 --> 21:06.222
You're not mad?

21:06.431 --> 21:07.640
Why would I be mad?

21:07.849 --> 21:11.060
Because there's certain rules
about this kind of stuff.

21:11.270 --> 21:15.022
You don't, uh... You don't fool around
with your friends' ex-girlfriends...

21:15.190 --> 21:16.315
...or, uh...

21:16.483 --> 21:19.568
...possible girlfriends
or girls they're related to.

21:25.075 --> 21:26.575
I am mad.

21:28.287 --> 21:30.913
But you know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna forgive you.

21:31.081 --> 21:33.124
Because that's what friends do.

21:33.292 --> 21:36.294
They forgive their friends when
they do everything you just said.

21:36.461 --> 21:39.005
- All the things on the list there.
- Thank you.

21:39.256 --> 21:40.923
But I want you to remember...

21:41.133 --> 21:43.467
...that I forgave you.

21:44.928 --> 21:46.887
- Okay.
- I also want you to remember...

21:47.055 --> 21:49.974
...that I let you live here rent-free.

21:50.475 --> 21:52.852
- All right.
- And I want you to remember...

21:53.020 --> 21:57.606
...that I gave you 27 dollars.

21:58.984 --> 22:00.151
No strings attached!

22:00.319 --> 22:01.861
If you can't remember that...

22:02.029 --> 22:04.697
...I think we should write it down.
Let's write it down!
