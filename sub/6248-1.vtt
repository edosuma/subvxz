- <i>[Booth] What'd you do?</i>
- I read...

00:06.506 --> 00:08.406
walked on the beach, chilled...

00:08.475 --> 00:10.466
Oh, you chilled in Darfur?

00:10.543 --> 00:12.704
- You chilled in Darfur?
- In North Carolina.

00:12.779 --> 00:14.804
I changed my vacation plans
to spend time with my brother.

00:14.881 --> 00:18.373
<i>Russ and I talked about it,</i>
<i>and we really want to find Dad.</i>

00:18.451 --> 00:21.614
Just so you know, the F.B.I.'s gonna find your
father no matter what you want.

00:21.688 --> 00:25.215
My brother and I don't want the F.B.I.
to back-burner the search.

[Tires Screeching]

00:27.527 --> 00:29.495
Is it okay to go
on two wheels like that?

00:29.562 --> 00:31.655
Only when making
very sharp turns at high speeds.

00:31.731 --> 00:35.132
Okay, Bones, why don't you have
a little, uh, you know, faith in me, okay?

00:35.201 --> 00:38.102
<i>I'm not gonna back-burner the case, all right?</i>
<i>I'm gonna find your father.</i>

00:38.171 --> 00:41.766
- My brother said you'd say that.
- You really keep saying "my brother" a lot.

00:41.841 --> 00:46.278
Well, I lost Russ for 15 years.
I like the sound of it.

- My brother.

Two passenger cars off the tracks, one on the side.

01:15.475 --> 01:17.705

- Uh-oh.
- <i>Dr. Brennan...</i>

01:40.300 --> 01:42.530
I'd like you to check out
the automobile this train hit.

01:42.602 --> 01:44.536
- It's probably what caused the derailment.
- [Booth] Accidental?

01:44.604 --> 01:48.165
N.T.S.B. guy says the train struck the car
at least 200 yards from the nearest access.

01:48.241 --> 01:50.869
- Deliberate?
- Eight minutes, Steve!

01:50.944 --> 01:53.742
Probably suicide.

01:53.813 --> 01:55.678
<i>Why are you still here, Dr. Brennan?</i>

01:55.748 --> 01:59.206
Because I'm not a coroner,

Well, you got that half right.

02:01.788 --> 02:04.552

02:04.624 --> 02:06.524
Thanks, Steve! All right.

<i>The next, she's hitting on you.</i>

02:26.746 --> 02:29.044
No. Goodman's my boss.

- All yours, Dr. Brandon.
- Brennan. Dr. Brennan.

02:32.585 --> 02:36.851

- No. There are thousands of you in D.C.

02:36.923 --> 02:39.391
<i>You know what?</i>
<i>While you were away, Goodman decided...</i>

02:39.459 --> 02:41.586
there should be a head of Forensics

- Why didn't Goodman hire me?

- <i>I have people skills.</i>

All right.
That firefighter's name is Nelson.

This is at least
the fourth time you've met him.

<i>Too melted for a regular car fire.</i>
<i>Do you see a skull?</i>

Hey, Bones.
I'm not looking for a skull.

03:13.493 --> 03:16.257
<i>Burn damage on the body is more intense</i>
<i>than I'd expect from a car fire...</i>

Do you see anything on this car

03:23.169 --> 03:25.763
- Booth, three deaths in the first-class car.
- Oh, homicide.

03:25.838 --> 03:27.772
That makes it <i>my</i> case.

<i>A senator? We're movin' up in the world.</i>

<i>Okay, what do we got?</i>

03:58.838 --> 04:03.036

<i>Athlete in his youth.</i>
<i>Right shoulder is worn from a repetitive motion.</i>

- before we're completely certain.
- <i>[Brennan] I know Senator Davis.</i>

04:54.494 --> 04:57.691
<i>Warren Lynch and Senator Davis</i>
<i>killed in one accident?</i>

Hey, Hodgepodge,

I'm cool.
As long as paranoia's on the schedule somewhere.

- Yep.

getting the head of Forensics job.

06:48.341 --> 06:49.933
Why is that?

07:23.609 --> 07:28.046

It's a very interesting case.

07:28.114 --> 07:32.141
Brennan identified skeletal remains
as her mother's... killed by a blow to the head.

07:32.218 --> 07:34.448
Initial suspect was her father.
But in the end, we arrested...

07:34.520 --> 07:36.317
a pig farmer/hit man
in witness protection.

07:36.389 --> 07:39.153
- Added wrinkle, Brennan gets a call...
- Dr. Hodgins?

07:39.225 --> 07:43.218
You're chattering me to death 'cause you hope
I'll forget you called me a wanktard.

The front car derailed,
killing three people, including Senator Paula Davis.

Preliminary indications show that the car

<i>Dr. Brennan, was theJeffersonian...</i>

08:10.189 --> 08:13.124
able to confirm that the driver
of the car was Warren Lynch?

08:13.192 --> 08:15.126
Dental records and physical characteristics
established that.

08:15.194 --> 08:17.219
- Yes.
- The vehicle was registered to Mr. Lynch.

08:17.296 --> 08:20.094

<i>Our good old Maryland State Police cameras...</i>
<i>they caught the infraction.</i>

<i>Nobody saw or heard from Warren Lynch</i>
<i>after this photo was taken.</i>

08:40.285 --> 08:42.549
You can't honestly
expect anyone to believe...

08:42.621 --> 08:45.386
that Warren Lynch committed suicide
by driving into a train.

08:45.458 --> 08:47.926
Daniel Burrows,
Security and Exchange Commission.

08:47.994 --> 08:50.224
We were about to lay charges
against Mr. Lynch...

08:50.296 --> 08:53.891
that would not only wipe him out financially
but send him to prison for several years.

08:53.966 --> 08:57.060
<i>I heard rumors.</i>
<i>But for a man like Lynch to kill himself...</i>

08:57.136 --> 08:59.195
<i>Mr. Lynch did not commit suicide.</i>

08:59.272 --> 09:02.173
<i>Dr. Brennan's examination shows</i>
<i>that he was dead for at least six hours...</i>

09:02.241 --> 09:04.175
before the train struck his car.

09:04.243 --> 09:06.609
- Dead how?
- I don't know that yet.

09:06.679 --> 09:08.670
But can we assume
that it was foul play?

09:08.748 --> 09:12.809
When it becomes public knowledge
that Warren Lynch is dead...

09:12.885 --> 09:15.115
stock in Lynchpin International's
gonna plummet.

09:15.187 --> 09:18.247
<i>Well, it sucks for the people</i>
<i>who invested in Lynchpin, but otherwise...</i>

09:18.324 --> 09:20.121
That's a motive for murder.

09:20.192 --> 09:23.218
How is losing money a motive?

09:23.296 --> 09:25.355
<i>[Burrows]</i>
<i>It's called shorting the stock.</i>

09:25.431 --> 09:27.865
Basically you bet that
the share price is gonna fall.

09:27.934 --> 09:29.868
And when it does, you collect.

09:29.936 --> 09:33.337

- Tens, maybe hundreds, of millions.

09:40.613 --> 09:42.604

Yes, these are Warren's things.

- Accidentally on purpose.

09:51.757 --> 09:55.557
- Why do you know things like this?
- It was my husband's motto.

09:55.628 --> 09:57.619
Mr. Lynch wrote about it
in his autobiography.

09:57.697 --> 10:01.394
<i>He played basketball in college.</i>
<i>Made it all the way to the national championships.</i>

10:01.467 --> 10:06.131
Warren was a high scorer, but a player
on the other team locked him out of the key.

10:06.205 --> 10:08.833
Warren injured the opposing player,
sent him to the hospital...

10:08.908 --> 10:11.069
and made it look
completely inadvertent.

10:11.143 --> 10:13.043
"Accidentally on purpose."

10:13.112 --> 10:15.672
He wrote this about himself
as if it were a good thing?

10:15.748 --> 10:18.842
Well, you don't become
Warren Lynch by playing by the rules.

10:18.918 --> 10:22.581
I'm still his wife.
So this all comes to me now, correct?

10:22.655 --> 10:25.556
<i>Still his wife, Mrs. Lynch?</i>

10:25.625 --> 10:27.991
Were you and Mr. Lynch
having marital problems?

10:28.060 --> 10:30.426
Warren and I were separating.

10:30.496 --> 10:33.363
- Why?
- Infidelity.

10:33.432 --> 10:35.764
Hmm. On whose part?

10:35.835 --> 10:38.702
I found out that Warren
was seeing someone.

10:38.771 --> 10:41.262
- Only <i>someone</i> turned out to be...
- Some dozen.

10:41.340 --> 10:43.171
Hmm. I'm gonna need a list.

10:43.242 --> 10:47.576
<i>When Brianna confronted Warren, he had</i>
<i>a private investigator look into her activities.</i>

10:47.647 --> 10:50.377
I admit, he didn't come up dry.

10:50.449 --> 10:52.940

- Rick Turco.

10:53.019 --> 10:56.079

<i>go-to, dirty-work fixer.</i>

10:56.155 --> 10:59.283
Yeah. I'm familiar with Rick Turco.
Thank you for your cooperation.

11:02.828 --> 11:04.762
<i>Cheating spouse who stands</i>
<i>to inherit it all.</i>

11:04.830 --> 11:08.425
Corrupt business practices.
And Turco, the private dick. Where do we start?

11:08.501 --> 11:10.935
Two types of glass were embedded
in what was left of Lynch.

11:11.003 --> 11:13.767
- We'll start with glass.
- Tempered automotive safety glass and silicate.

11:13.839 --> 11:16.399
Tempered glass came from the car windows.
What about the other?

11:16.475 --> 11:18.807
It's 70% amorphous silicon dioxide.

11:18.878 --> 11:22.211
- What's that?
- It's a common domestic container.

11:22.281 --> 11:26.274
Oh. Like a jar.
Why can't we just say a jar?

11:29.955 --> 11:32.685
- Anything new, Zackaroni?
- Zackaroni?

11:32.758 --> 11:36.421
<i>The victim's left shoulder</i>
<i>and elbow were badly dislocated postmortem.</i>

11:36.495 --> 11:39.328
You mean between the time
he died and the time he got hit by the train?

11:39.398 --> 11:41.423
<i>[Brennan] Blood flow was nonexistent</i>
<i>when the dislocation occurred.</i>

11:41.500 --> 11:44.128
Okay. You guys do this stuff,
and I'll start on Turco.

11:44.203 --> 11:46.228
- What's that?
- A private investigator.

11:46.305 --> 11:48.239
Turco's an affliction.

11:48.307 --> 11:50.571
I'll set up a meeting and call you.

11:50.643 --> 11:53.043
You shouldn't call me Zackaroni.

11:53.112 --> 11:55.546
Yeah. I knew that
the moment I said it.

11:55.614 --> 11:58.674
I'm going to get
a bone mineral density reading.

11:58.751 --> 12:01.117
You didn't actually
want the job, did you?

12:01.187 --> 12:03.451
I don't even know what the job is.

12:03.522 --> 12:06.013
Well, Goodman will
explain his decision.

12:06.092 --> 12:08.822
Goodman appointed Dr. Saroyan
while I was on vacation...

12:08.894 --> 12:11.488
then took a two-month sabbatical
to avoid me.

12:11.564 --> 12:13.657
- That explains a lot.
- All right. You know, I think...

12:13.733 --> 12:15.997
it's because
you are very task-oriented.

12:16.068 --> 12:20.471
Zack? Task-oriented is a euphemism
for lacking overall perspective.

12:20.539 --> 12:23.997
Oh, no. No.

12:24.076 --> 12:27.477
Yeah. Yeah. A little.

12:27.546 --> 12:29.480
Like, when's my birthday?

12:29.548 --> 12:32.210
I can get the computer
to remind me about birthdays.

12:32.284 --> 12:34.445
[Sighs]
That's one of a gajillion examples.

12:34.520 --> 12:36.784
You could tell me
the other gajillion minus one.

12:36.856 --> 12:39.120
What do you see, Zack?

12:39.191 --> 12:41.125
Uh, bone loss.

12:41.193 --> 12:44.959
<i>Lack ofbone density suggests that</i>
<i>Warren Lynch was much older than his 40s.</i>

12:45.030 --> 12:47.396
But the other indicators of age...

12:47.466 --> 12:51.960
<i>epiphyseal rings, cranial sutures...</i>
<i>all disagree.</i>

12:52.037 --> 12:55.473
Age doesn't explain the ossification
of cartilage where the ribs meet the sternum.

12:55.541 --> 12:58.738
- Well, what does explain it?
- <i>[Brennan] Opiates.</i>

13:04.583 --> 13:07.916
Warren Lynch was a heroin addict.

13:12.591 --> 13:16.425
Agent Booth,
I'm a private investigator.

13:16.495 --> 13:19.589
My greatest asset is my discretion.

13:19.665 --> 13:22.099
Brianna Lynch already told us
that you work for her husband.

13:22.168 --> 13:24.659
Well, Miss Lynch is welcome
to say whatever she likes.

13:24.737 --> 13:29.174
That client confidentiality routine
no longer exists when the client is dead.

13:29.241 --> 13:33.109
That's not the assurance
I give my very demanding, very high profile clients.

13:33.179 --> 13:35.739
Till death do us not part.

13:35.815 --> 13:38.875
Yeah. How would your very demanding,
very high profile clients feel...

13:38.951 --> 13:42.717
if they found out that you procured heroin
for Warren Lynch?

13:42.788 --> 13:45.222
[Exhales]
What?

13:45.291 --> 13:47.088
Warren Lynch was a heroin addict.

13:47.159 --> 13:49.525
I'm gonna open up
a drug investigation on <i>you,</i> Mr. Turco.

13:49.595 --> 13:52.621
<i>Once the press gets wind of that,</i>
<i>your very high profile clients...</i>

13:52.698 --> 13:55.428
will find some other
unprincipled Mr. Fix It.

13:55.501 --> 13:58.265
Warren Lynch was a junkie?

13:58.337 --> 14:00.737
- What's your evidence?
- Bones?

14:05.611 --> 14:08.705
Well, so what does all this mean?

14:08.781 --> 14:12.239
- Sum it up for the man, Bones.
- Warren Lynch suffered declining bone mass...

14:12.318 --> 14:16.618
due to long-term abuse
of his hypothalamic pituitary gonadal access.

14:16.689 --> 14:20.455
Nothing says junkie
like your gonads' access, Ricky.

14:20.526 --> 14:24.724
I had no idea.
And I certainly never procured any heroin for him.

14:24.797 --> 14:27.789
Warren Lynch sure as hell wasn't trolling
for $10 hits in Lincoln Heights.

14:27.867 --> 14:30.392
Come on, Agent Booth.
You know my rep.

14:30.469 --> 14:33.302
I'm a sin eater.
I make problems go away.

14:33.372 --> 14:37.809
You mean like when Lynch's wife found out
that he was sleeping with other women?

14:37.877 --> 14:40.004
- Oh.
- [Sighs]

14:40.079 --> 14:42.513
All right. Anything I say,
strictest confidence, correct?

14:42.581 --> 14:44.811
Hmm.

14:44.884 --> 14:48.945
Warren Lynch brought me in
to deal with a blackmailer.

14:49.021 --> 14:51.683
Warren Lynch was being blackmailed?

14:51.757 --> 14:55.215
- By one of his girlfriends?
- That would be my assumption, yes.

14:55.294 --> 14:59.025
I paid 'em off before.
But this was a much bigger deal. More serious.

14:59.098 --> 15:02.158
- Had to be the heroin, right?
- How'd it play out?

15:02.234 --> 15:05.670
I negotiated the payment down
from a mil to a quarter million, paid 'em off.

15:05.738 --> 15:08.605
- That was three days ago.
- How?

15:08.674 --> 15:12.770
- Dead drop at Rock Creek Park.
- And you have no idea who it was?

15:12.845 --> 15:14.972
Well, I had a phone call.
I traced it back.

15:15.047 --> 15:17.277
It dead-ended
on a stolen cell phone.

15:25.858 --> 15:27.792
You did a good job.

15:27.860 --> 15:30.886
<i>Given your heroin bombshell,</i>
<i>I went back to what tissue remained...</i>

15:30.963 --> 15:32.726
and found traces of
laudanine and reticuline...

15:32.798 --> 15:34.459
alkaloids found in the opium poppy.

15:34.533 --> 15:37.764
I'd like Angela to do
a facial reconstruction.

15:37.836 --> 15:40.532
Confirm my finding?

15:40.606 --> 15:43.575
- It's handy having a pathologist
right in the building.
- To turn opium into heroin...

15:43.642 --> 15:47.976
it's exposed to hot acetic anhydride,
which produces 18 neutral impurities.

15:48.047 --> 15:51.039
<i>The ratio of these impurities indicates</i>
<i>the heroin's origin. In this case, Mexico.</i>

15:51.116 --> 15:53.584
Mexican heroin is very common.

15:53.652 --> 15:58.112
I... I wonder if there's anything we can do
to narrow it down further.

16:00.459 --> 16:02.586
- Gas chromatography...
- [Beeping]

16:02.661 --> 16:04.891
<i>shows there was also</i>
<i>fentanyl in the heroin.</i>

16:04.964 --> 16:07.728
What's that?

16:07.800 --> 16:10.769
This reminds me of when you interviewed me
to be your grad student.

16:10.836 --> 16:13.066
She knows what fentanyl is.

16:13.138 --> 16:16.699
<i>It's a narcotic which boosts</i>
<i>the effects of the heroin.</i>

16:16.775 --> 16:18.800
According to Metro cops...

16:18.877 --> 16:21.573
14 addicts O.D.'d this week
off this one shipment.

16:21.647 --> 16:24.514
- Have you told Booth?
- I'll leave that to you.

16:27.619 --> 16:30.179
How'd I do?

16:32.524 --> 16:34.651
I thought she did quite well.

16:34.727 --> 16:36.718
You said you had
something else to show me.

16:37.396 --> 16:41.127
<i>[Zack] In a car fire, gasoline vapor ignites</i>
<i>at 280 degrees Celsius...</i>

16:41.200 --> 16:43.361
<i>and rises to a flame temperature</i>
<i>of 2,200 degrees.</i>

16:43.435 --> 16:45.665
<i>[Hodgins]</i>
<i>If the gas tank were full at the time of impact...</i>

16:45.738 --> 16:48.366
the fire should have burned for
approximately 20 minutes without intervention.

16:48.440 --> 16:50.465
Tell me that's not a real skeleton.

16:50.542 --> 16:53.705
No. We made him out of
calcium phosphate and hydroxyapatite.

16:53.779 --> 16:55.804
And Spam.

16:55.881 --> 16:57.473
Twenty minutes now!

16:59.451 --> 17:02.443
<i>That's still a significant</i>
<i>amount of Spam.</i>

17:02.521 --> 17:04.954
<i>And according to</i>
<i>the fire department report...</i>

17:05.023 --> 17:09.050
the car burned for 40 minutes,
and it still took four minutes to put out.

17:09.127 --> 17:11.618
- Which means there was extra fuel.
- And the extra glass you found?

17:11.696 --> 17:14.426
- Five-gallon mason jars.
- <i>[Zack] Six of them.</i>

17:14.500 --> 17:16.661
- Filled with gasoline.
- Yeah, or moonshine.

17:18.470 --> 17:21.165
Why does the whole lab
smell like a luau?

17:21.240 --> 17:24.800
<i>Zack and Hodgins are proving</i>
<i>that there was extra accelerant in Lynch's vehicle.</i>

17:24.877 --> 17:28.506
- Using what medium?
- Artificial bone covered with Spam.

17:28.580 --> 17:31.777
Turn this off.

17:41.860 --> 17:44.090
- Why wasn't I told about this?
- [Chuckles]

17:44.163 --> 17:46.097
I encourage independent inquiry.

17:46.165 --> 17:48.463
Your encouragement does not
<i>signify</i> my authorization.

17:48.534 --> 17:50.263
<i>If it happens again,</i>
<i>I will take action.</i>

17:50.335 --> 17:53.827
And I'm from New York, which means
that I will take New York action. Am I clear?

17:53.906 --> 17:57.034
- Not at all.
- I'm from Michigan.

17:57.109 --> 17:59.270
Dr. Saroyan means
she'll make us watch musical theater.

17:59.344 --> 18:02.211
<i>Wrong New York. I'm more from</i>
<i>the "get mugged in broad daylight" tradition.</i>

18:02.281 --> 18:04.272
<i>This is not</i>
<i>a high school science fair.</i>

18:04.349 --> 18:06.817
This is theJeffersonian Institute.

18:06.885 --> 18:08.876
Unauthorized experiments
in Forensics will get you fired.

18:08.954 --> 18:12.390
But we're Hodgepodge and Zackaroni.

18:12.458 --> 18:16.952
- And they work for me.
- What I'd really like to do is
enjoy a meeting of the minds.

18:17.029 --> 18:19.691
<i>But if you insist on</i>
<i>an organizational pyramid...</i>

18:19.765 --> 18:22.700
I will be at the top.

18:28.440 --> 18:30.374
<i>[Booth]</i>
<i>Spam?</i>

18:30.442 --> 18:32.467
[Brennan] They're mason jars
filled with gasoline in the backseat...

18:32.544 --> 18:34.478
intended to break
when the train hit.

18:34.546 --> 18:36.571
- Wow. And they got this with Spam?
- Yeah, Spam.

18:36.648 --> 18:39.014
Hmm. And Cam, she got all
bent out of shape.

18:39.084 --> 18:41.018
She wants to authorize all experiments.

18:41.086 --> 18:43.020
Great. You know,
Zack and Hodgins...

18:43.088 --> 18:45.283
they do an experiment
with fake bones and Spam.

18:45.357 --> 18:49.259
- What is your Spam fixation?
- A defense lawyer hears Spam...

18:49.328 --> 18:51.523
he makes a joke,
and the jury laughs.

18:51.597 --> 18:56.034
And everything we get from theJeffersonian
is framed as <i>goofy</i> science, you know...

18:56.101 --> 18:59.468
from a bunch of squints
with no connection to the real world.

18:59.538 --> 19:01.472
- That wouldn't happen.
- Really?

19:01.540 --> 19:04.100
And the time you dropped the dead monkey
down the elevator shaft?

19:04.176 --> 19:06.770
That was to show...

19:06.845 --> 19:08.904
Okay, I take your point.

19:08.981 --> 19:12.576
Cam's goal is a successful prosecution
in a court of law.

19:12.651 --> 19:15.882
- Same as mine and yours.
- No. You're all about finding the truth.

19:15.954 --> 19:20.288
Okay, your words say good,
but your tone says bad.

19:20.359 --> 19:23.760
- So it's confusing.
- Cam knows that too much truth...

19:23.829 --> 19:26.923
- is just as bad as too little.
- <i>[Cell Phone Ringing]</i>

19:26.999 --> 19:29.092
Okay? Which is why she got the job.

19:29.168 --> 19:31.102
Booth.

19:31.170 --> 19:35.266
Angela says that you and Cam had a sexual
relationship. Does that affect your view of her?

19:35.340 --> 19:37.308
Patch me through.
Wildly out of line.

19:37.376 --> 19:40.038
Just so you know that.

19:40.112 --> 19:42.046
- When?
- Hmm.

19:42.114 --> 19:44.241
- Did you get the doer?
- Personal prerogative...

19:44.316 --> 19:46.409
- is at the heart of scientific inquiry.
- Bones.

19:48.387 --> 19:51.015
- [Sighs]
- Thanks for the notification.

20:00.465 --> 20:02.456
What?

20:04.603 --> 20:09.097
The man who was charged
with murdering your mother...

20:09.174 --> 20:11.734
The pig farmer, Vince McVicar.

20:11.810 --> 20:13.243
He was killed.

20:14.947 --> 20:18.474
- Today at the Alexandria Federal Holding Facility.
- [Sighs]

20:20.319 --> 20:22.253
[Sighs]

20:22.321 --> 20:24.255
I don't...

20:25.991 --> 20:29.017
He was the only connection
to my father.

20:29.094 --> 20:31.289
His trial was gonna be my...

20:36.935 --> 20:39.460
How am I ever gonna find out
what really happened?

20:50.048 --> 20:51.982
<i>[Saroyan]</i>
<i>That's not Warren Lynch.</i>

20:52.050 --> 20:54.985
- How accurate is this thing?
- [Brennan] It's not the machine that's accurate.

20:55.053 --> 20:56.714
It's Angela, and she's good.

20:56.788 --> 20:58.517
That is not Warren Lynch.

20:58.590 --> 21:02.356
Hey, Zack provided a skull,
and this is the face that goes with it.

21:03.462 --> 21:05.453
Could it be the wrong skull?

21:05.530 --> 21:09.159
Zack doesn't make that kind of mistake.
He's also very good.

21:09.234 --> 21:12.397
- What about the dental records?
- I'll check 'em for tampering.

21:12.471 --> 21:15.804
- But you're certain that the body in the car...
- Is not Warren Lynch.

21:15.874 --> 21:18.502
- Absolutely certain.
- All right.

21:27.619 --> 21:30.144
[Supac]
The man in the car was not Warren Lynch?

21:30.222 --> 21:33.055
No. This was the man
behind the wheel.

21:33.125 --> 21:36.322
- You had dental records.
- <i>Well, somebody digitized...</i>

21:36.395 --> 21:38.761
Lynch's dental X-rays
and then refilmed them...

21:38.830 --> 21:41.492
utilizing authentic
alphanumeric bar codes.

21:41.566 --> 21:44.501
- The records were expertly faked.
- Where the hell is Warren Lynch?

21:44.569 --> 21:47.265
<i>I've informed the F.B.I. that they might want</i>
<i>to start looking for him.</i>

21:47.339 --> 21:49.239
In the meantime,
we're moving to I.D. this guy.

21:49.308 --> 21:53.005
Mistakes like this cannot happen
when the case concerns a dead senator.

21:53.078 --> 21:56.343
Miss Montenegro uncovered a fraud.
That's the opposite of a mistake.

21:56.415 --> 21:58.440
Save it for the press conference,
Dr. Saroyan.

22:00.452 --> 22:02.716
Thank you.

22:02.788 --> 22:06.451
Hey, if you'd made a mistake,
I'd have thrown you to the wolves.

22:06.525 --> 22:09.722
<i>[Booth] Metro cops hinted the guy</i>
<i>pushing the Mexican heroin...</i>

<i>young guy, baldy-headed,</i>
<i>5'5", 145 pounds.</i>

not in alleyways by criminals.

22:26.278 --> 22:28.576
Yeah, right.

22:31.116 --> 22:33.107
- Hey, that's our guy. Let's go.
- Oh, no, no. Shh.

- However long it takes.

22:43.795 --> 22:46.992
What do we do while we wait?

22:47.065 --> 22:49.090
This is a stakeout.
We converse.

22:49.167 --> 22:51.897
Well, I tried to initiate conversation
on the drug war but...

22:51.970 --> 22:53.904
Oh, God, fine.
You know what?

22:53.972 --> 22:56.497
Let's just talk about something
we're not gonna argue about.

22:56.575 --> 22:59.066
[Sighs]

23:00.412 --> 23:03.711
- Been out to your mother's grave?
- Not since the funeral.

23:03.782 --> 23:06.649
- Really?
- Why would I?

23:06.718 --> 23:09.812
- Well, to connect.
- She's dead.

23:11.456 --> 23:13.947
Fine. You know what?
Forget it.

23:14.025 --> 23:17.119
Dead. As in gone from this world.

Excuse me.

23:24.569 --> 23:26.503
I'm curious.

23:26.571 --> 23:28.801
Um, do you talk to the headstone?

23:28.874 --> 23:31.468
I mean, what do you...
What do you say?

23:31.543 --> 23:33.602
It looks like
I'm talking to the headstone.

23:33.678 --> 23:35.669
But what I'm really saying is that...

23:35.747 --> 23:38.511
Forget about where the words are aimed.

23:38.583 --> 23:41.017
What I say is that...

23:41.086 --> 23:43.520
I remember them.

23:43.588 --> 23:45.647
They can't hear you...

23:45.724 --> 23:48.454
because they're dead.

23:48.527 --> 23:51.325
My mouth moves,
words come out...

23:51.396 --> 23:54.365

24:01.807 --> 24:03.297
What princess?

24:03.375 --> 24:05.172
- Hey! Oh, hey, Eddie.
- What the hell?

Don't you have to read him his rights
before you strangle him?

24:12.150 --> 24:14.380
- Empty.
- I had to hold his throat closed...

24:14.453 --> 24:16.045
so he wouldn't swallow the evidence.

24:16.121 --> 24:18.487
All right. If you bite me...

24:18.557 --> 24:21.219

- You shouldn't swallow heroin. It's dangerous.

- [Groaning]
- Okay. Eddie.

24:32.404 --> 24:34.998
Eddie... Eddie.

24:35.073 --> 24:36.665
Eddie, Eddie, Eddie.
Hey, Eddie.

24:36.741 --> 24:38.800
I'm gonna ask you a question, okay?

24:38.877 --> 24:41.345
You answer, you walk away.
All right?

24:41.413 --> 24:45.179
- You don't answer...
- You book me. I get sick.

24:45.250 --> 24:48.413
- I know the drill.
- No. If you don't answer...

24:48.487 --> 24:53.390
I'm gonna cram this back down your throat
without the protection.

24:53.458 --> 24:57.519
All right, you sold some of this crap to a tall guy,
over six and a half feet tall.

24:57.596 --> 24:59.461
- Show him, Bones.
- What?

24:59.531 --> 25:02.295
- Show him.
- Oh, um...

25:03.935 --> 25:07.371
- Like that tall.
- Uh, nobody I know.

- Ray! Ray Stewart.
- Tell me about Ray, huh?

25:18.617 --> 25:20.551
Everybody knows him down here.
He's a longtime skel.

25:20.619 --> 25:23.144
When was the last time you saw him?

25:23.221 --> 25:25.416
He bought a stick of dynamite
about three days ago.

25:25.490 --> 25:27.617
I feel I should alert you.

25:27.692 --> 25:30.593
There's an additive in this heroin
that causes overdoses.

25:31.897 --> 25:33.797
- Well...
- Thanks.

25:33.865 --> 25:36.265
- Hey, where'd you find her?
- Museum.

- <i>[Cell Phone Ringing]</i>
- Oh.

- We should warn the addicts.
- Yeah. Like they do on a pack of cigarettes.

When? Thanks.

25:44.209 --> 25:46.143
- What?
- They found Warren Lynch.

25:46.211 --> 25:50.375
<i>Mr. Lynch was thrown</i>
<i>from a speeding car.</i>

25:50.448 --> 25:53.474
It's a minor miracle he survived.

25:53.552 --> 25:55.986
It may be because he was already
unconscious at the time.

25:56.054 --> 25:58.284
- Unconscious?
- <i>Yes.</i>

25:58.356 --> 26:01.917
<i>Badly beaten.</i>
<i>Internal bleeding, broken ribs...</i>

<i>both legs, some spinal damage,</i>
<i>broken pelvis.</i>

- Anytime you want...

Best case scenario, he spends the rest of his life

This is one of the richest men
in the country.

26:23.014 --> 26:26.541
Most of the time, that might mean something.
Not now.

<i>I'm sorry. Anything that man has in his head,</i>
<i>it's going to stay there.</i>

26:35.760 --> 26:37.694
Excuse me.

26:49.674 --> 26:52.108
After Zack nagged me
a hundred times...

26:52.177 --> 26:55.738
It's important for us to explain how
the victim's shoulder and elbow were dislocated.

26:55.814 --> 26:58.044
[Angela]
And I re-created the most likely sequence.

26:58.116 --> 27:00.880
[Bones Popping]

27:00.952 --> 27:03.785
- Ouch!
- The victim was dead when this happened.

27:03.855 --> 27:05.789
He didn't feel it.

27:05.857 --> 27:08.655
Run it again.

27:09.728 --> 27:11.719
<i>Looks like he was</i>
<i>putting his jacket on.</i>

27:11.796 --> 27:13.855
Corpses don't usually do that.

27:13.932 --> 27:16.924
<i>These injuries occurred</i>
<i>when the corpse was forced into a jacket.</i>

27:17.002 --> 27:20.096
- Yeah. Most likely by two people.
- Yeah. In a big hurry.

27:20.171 --> 27:23.004
They had a train to meet.

27:23.074 --> 27:25.042
- You got anything on the H.O.V. lane photograph?
- Yeah.

27:25.110 --> 27:28.944
It was relatively easy to get
the license plate numbers from these two cars.

27:29.014 --> 27:30.845
<i>Yeah, well, I'll check 'em out.</i>

27:30.915 --> 27:32.906
<i>But there was another car.</i>

27:32.984 --> 27:35.111
- In the next lane.
- How do you know that?

27:35.186 --> 27:38.587
- Well, rich guys keep their cars shiny.

[Beeping]

27:46.865 --> 27:49.356
<i>I don't know if that's</i>
<i>of any use to you.</i>

27:49.434 --> 27:52.403
Yeah. It's of use.

27:53.705 --> 27:56.731
Booth, do either of these
count as experiments?

27:56.808 --> 27:58.776
'Cause if they do,
we could both get fired...

27:58.843 --> 28:00.777

28:00.845 --> 28:03.370
[Chuckles]
You know, you just quit telling Bones...

28:03.448 --> 28:06.212
- who you think I've slept with.
- <i>[Angela] Think?</i>

28:06.284 --> 28:09.151
What do you mean, think?

28:11.990 --> 28:14.720
[Saroyan] Two people forced the corpse
into a jacket. That's excellent work.

28:14.793 --> 28:18.058
- Who's that?
- I think it's Rick Turco.

28:18.129 --> 28:21.587
Means Turco's probably the last person
to see Lynch before he fell off the radar.

28:21.666 --> 28:23.964
Angela and Zack are scared
that this counts as an experiment...

28:24.035 --> 28:26.128
and you are gonna fire them.

28:26.204 --> 28:27.933
Ah, I am getting through.

28:28.006 --> 28:29.974
Why did you take this job, Camille?

28:30.041 --> 28:32.839
- Why shouldn't I, Seeley?
- Because it's basically herding cats...

28:32.911 --> 28:34.845
and you're a dog person.

28:34.913 --> 28:37.643
- Dogs herd cats.
- Dogs don't do that.

28:37.716 --> 28:41.743
- Chase 'em up trees, whatever.
- Seriously, Cam. Why did you take this job?

28:41.820 --> 28:45.779
[Clicks Tongue]
These are titanium rib clippers from Germany.

28:45.857 --> 28:50.260
My last job, used bolt cutters from Home Depot.
These are much, much nicer.

28:50.328 --> 28:54.287
This autopsy table has downdraft ventilation.
No rotting corpse smell, Seeley.

28:54.365 --> 28:56.026
<i>My last table</i>
<i>didn't even have a drain.</i>

28:56.101 --> 28:58.763
Think about that a second.
Leaky corpse, no drain.

28:58.837 --> 29:02.295
So you took this job
for better equipment?

29:02.373 --> 29:06.309
I've spent my whole professional life
in basement rooms with no windows.

29:06.377 --> 29:08.311
Now I'm in theJeffersonian Institute.

29:10.248 --> 29:12.113
- What?
- Gotta ask.

29:12.183 --> 29:15.175
- You <i>so</i> do not.
- Or did you take this job because of...

29:15.253 --> 29:18.188
[Laughing]
Oh, my God. The ego.

29:18.256 --> 29:21.350
[Mock Chuckling]
Say it.

29:23.027 --> 29:25.860
Nothing to do with you.

29:25.930 --> 29:29.661
- I need Bones this afternoon.
- Okay.

29:29.734 --> 29:32.828
It's about her mother's murder
and her father's disappearance.

29:32.904 --> 29:35.873
- Plus, she dedicated her book to you, so...
- It's a legitimate case, Cam.

29:35.940 --> 29:38.738
I know.
I read the file.

29:38.810 --> 29:41.574
- Why hasn't she confronted me?
- About what?

29:41.646 --> 29:45.582
About me being parachuted in
over her head.

29:45.650 --> 29:48.380
- Finds me intimidating, right?
- [Chuckling]

29:48.453 --> 29:50.512
Hey, I intimidate people.

29:50.588 --> 29:53.421
Yeah.

29:53.491 --> 29:55.425
Bones doesn't intimidate.

29:55.493 --> 29:57.893
Then what?

29:57.962 --> 30:01.921
You've seen the way she stares
at human remains before she makes a decision.

30:02.000 --> 30:04.230
- Yes.
- You're human remains...

30:04.302 --> 30:07.066
and she hasn't made a decision yet.

30:13.778 --> 30:16.246
How do I help her
make the right decision?

30:16.314 --> 30:19.442
Go for the truth.
Take care of her people.

30:19.517 --> 30:23.214
<i>Oh, and I like the whole</i>
<i>intimidation thing.</i>

30:23.288 --> 30:25.222
I think it's cute.

30:36.968 --> 30:38.902
I got no reason to lie.

30:38.970 --> 30:42.667
I'm facing life at least.
Probably gonna get executed.

30:42.740 --> 30:46.107

- Mr. Downs killed his entire family.

30:46.177 --> 30:48.145
I killed your friend...

30:48.213 --> 30:51.740
'cause he cut in the cafeteria line
and snagged the last orange juice.

30:51.816 --> 30:55.149
Broke off a sharpened toothbrush
in his jugular.

30:55.220 --> 30:58.087
- Mr. Downs, the man you killed...
- McVicar?

30:58.156 --> 31:00.886
He's not my friend.
He killed my mother.

31:00.959 --> 31:03.928
- You come to tell me thanks?
- <i>No.</i>

31:03.995 --> 31:07.954
McVicar was my last chance
to find out some things.

31:08.032 --> 31:10.000
McVicar might've known
something about my father.

31:10.068 --> 31:13.299
I can't ask my father
because he left a message...

31:13.371 --> 31:15.669

- Did you perform a hit for Max Keenan?

31:44.402 --> 31:48.839

If he did that, and I'm not saying
it happened that way...

32:02.253 --> 32:04.983
then your father took down
the man who murdered his wife.

32:05.056 --> 32:06.990
Good people don't have
other people murdered.

32:07.058 --> 32:08.855
Good people don't even know how.

32:08.927 --> 32:12.761
Your father buried your mother
in a pair of new shoes in the cemetery...

32:12.830 --> 32:14.889
with her dolphin belt buckle
that reminded her of you...

32:14.966 --> 32:16.900

Okay? We know that your father got to
Mitchell Downs, persuaded him to kill McVicar.

32:27.979 --> 32:29.810
We find out how he did that...

32:29.881 --> 32:33.476
we're that much closer to finding out
what happened to your old man.

32:33.551 --> 32:35.849
I mean, that's if you still want to find him.

32:35.920 --> 32:39.048

He had his own dolphin. That "N.C., lots of A's,"

But not the championship ring.

- That's good, Bones.
- The only reason they wouldn't

34:31.002 --> 34:35.302
intended a white-collar crime,
but a senator died.

34:35.373 --> 34:37.431
<i>[Turco On Speaker, Laughing]</i>
<i>Then I got all hinky...</i>

34:37.507 --> 34:39.840
and tossed Warren out of the car
at 80 miles an hour.

34:39.911 --> 34:41.606
[Chuckling]

34:41.679 --> 34:44.147
Is that a confession?

34:44.215 --> 34:47.946
Nah. Nah.
Just gettin' it straight.

34:48.018 --> 34:52.012
<i>You know, as a professional</i>
<i>investigator myself...</i>

34:52.090 --> 34:56.789
I have to point out
that blackmailers make much better suspects.

34:56.860 --> 35:01.491
Well, Lynchpin has no record of
a quarter-million-dollar payout three days ago.

35:01.566 --> 35:05.195
Well, there's not exactly a column
for blackmail payouts in the corporate books.

35:05.269 --> 35:08.864
<i>If I'd only agreed</i>
<i>to the full payout...</i>

35:08.940 --> 35:11.738
<i>Lynch might've never been</i>
<i>taken by those animals.</i>

35:13.211 --> 35:16.180
Hey, let's play
a little show-and-tell, huh?

35:16.247 --> 35:20.547
'Cause we can put you with Lynch
moments before he fell off the radar.

35:25.756 --> 35:29.351
That's maybe me before
he fell off the radar.

35:29.427 --> 35:32.089
<i>We worked together.</i>

35:32.163 --> 35:35.257
[Chuckles]
You got nothin'.

35:38.603 --> 35:41.071
Booth.

35:46.110 --> 35:48.271
- Do that lying thing.
- Could you be more specific?

35:48.346 --> 35:51.713
We tell him Lynch woke up
and gave a statement incriminating him.

35:51.782 --> 35:55.582
- Turco knows the lying thing.
- Tell him Lynch said something
only Lynch could say.

35:55.653 --> 35:58.417
Oh, great idea, except for
the "only Lynch could say" part.

35:58.489 --> 36:01.617
- [Gulps] The ring?
- Ah, he'll ask for specifics of the conversations.

36:01.692 --> 36:04.183
- I gotta cut him loose.
- What... He's gonna get away with it?

36:04.262 --> 36:06.287
Well, you know,
that happens sometimes, Bones.

36:06.364 --> 36:08.662
That's that brown
little smelly part of the job.

36:08.733 --> 36:11.634
Shoulder and elbow.
The junkie's shoulder and elbow...

36:11.702 --> 36:14.728
were dislocated when they
forced him into Lynch's jacket.

36:14.805 --> 36:17.672
- We don't know if Lynch was there for that.
- It took two people.

36:17.742 --> 36:20.142
It was him.

36:20.211 --> 36:22.145
Come on, Booth.

36:22.213 --> 36:25.876
The part of you with
the big gambling problem must love this idea.

36:27.385 --> 36:31.378
Right there. Mm-hmm.
That's the reason you didn't get Cam's job.

36:35.092 --> 36:37.788
Oh, two against one.
That's unfair.

36:37.862 --> 36:42.128
- Warren Lynch woke up.
- Ah, and he's talking, right?

36:42.200 --> 36:44.498
Huh? Is he pointing
his finger straight at me?

36:44.569 --> 36:46.059
- That's correct.
- What's he saying?

36:46.137 --> 36:49.106
He let you take all of his jewelry
except his championship ring.

36:49.173 --> 36:51.300
No. I asked,
what did he say, in words.

36:55.079 --> 36:59.140
Hey, unless I'm under arrest,
I'm leaving, folks.

36:59.217 --> 37:02.983
Mr. Lynch said it was difficult
getting his jacket onto the corpse.

37:03.054 --> 37:05.045
<i>Rigor mortis.</i>

37:05.122 --> 37:07.647
You have a train to meet.
You're in a hurry.

37:07.725 --> 37:09.750
And the sound
of the shoulder popping.

37:12.063 --> 37:13.997
[Bones Popping]

37:16.434 --> 37:18.664
Then the elbow,
like knuckles popping...

37:18.736 --> 37:20.363
[Popping]

37:20.438 --> 37:22.406
only louder.

37:23.708 --> 37:25.676
Sickening.

37:41.425 --> 37:45.486
Turco will admit to helping
Warren Lynch place a dead body...

37:45.563 --> 37:48.726
in Mr. Lynch's car
and rigging it to burn...

37:48.799 --> 37:51.029
with the intent
of moving the market.

37:51.102 --> 37:54.196
Everything else,
including placing it on the tracks...

37:54.272 --> 37:56.206
he says Lynch did on his own.

37:56.274 --> 37:59.209
- He's lying.
- There's a small matter of proving that in court.

37:59.277 --> 38:01.745
- What's the maximum sentence on those charges?
- Ten years.

38:01.812 --> 38:04.007
<i>He killed three people.</i>

38:04.081 --> 38:08.211
- <i>And put one in a coma.</i>
- But Lynch deserves to be in a coma,
so it doesn't count.

38:08.286 --> 38:10.811
<i>Look. Turco puts all the blame on Lynch.</i>
<i>He does 10 years...</i>

38:10.888 --> 38:12.879
and he gets all the money
from shorting the stock.

38:12.957 --> 38:16.552
<i>It's 10 years or nothing.</i>
<i>I can only work with what I'm given...</i>

38:16.627 --> 38:18.652
and the forensic work
on this was not good enough.

38:18.729 --> 38:21.323
- What?
- <i>You were fooled by fake dental records...</i>

38:21.399 --> 38:23.264
you baked some Spam.

38:23.334 --> 38:25.063
<i>[Saroyan]</i>
<i>What did you want us to do?</i>

38:25.136 --> 38:27.036
- Your jobs.
- Hey!

38:27.104 --> 38:29.664
You want us to do <i>your</i> job.
My people gave you all the evidence you need...

38:29.740 --> 38:31.332
to fry Turco
with any reasonable jury.

38:31.409 --> 38:34.503
- Forensically...
- We gave you everything you needed
to arrest Turco.

38:34.578 --> 38:37.342
- Arrest is not a conviction.
- <i>We gave you enough to reject his plea bargain...</i>

38:37.415 --> 38:39.349
and indict him in
the wrongful death of a senator.

38:39.417 --> 38:43.046
- Indictment is not a conviction.
- You accept that plea bargain,
the investigation stops.

38:43.120 --> 38:46.351
<i>Indict him.</i>
<i>Give us time to give you what you need.</i>

38:46.424 --> 38:48.858
If you accept this plea,
you don't deserve to be a federal prosecutor.

38:48.926 --> 38:50.917
- Dr. Saroyan...
- Yeah, it's scary.

38:50.995 --> 38:54.294
The whole country will be watching, and you don't
want to go with less than a sure thing.

38:54.365 --> 38:57.630
But you put my people on the stand
as expert witnesses, and that's a sure thing.

38:57.702 --> 39:00.227
- [Together] Not Zack.
- <i>[Saroyan] You tell the story of what happened...</i>

39:00.304 --> 39:01.931
using the evidence
these people provided.

39:02.006 --> 39:04.065
<i>If you have any ability as a prosecutor,</i>
<i>you'll win the case.</i>

39:04.141 --> 39:06.336
- Are you finished?
- No, Miss Supac.

39:06.410 --> 39:08.435
In the future, when you have
problems with my team...

39:08.512 --> 39:12.448
you register them with me in private,
not by grandstanding in a public forum.

39:25.329 --> 39:27.593
<i>[Brennan]</i>
<i>Okay, um...</i>

39:27.665 --> 39:30.463
I'm starting to see
why she got the job.

39:37.641 --> 39:39.575
[Booth]
Well, looks like your brother was here.

39:39.643 --> 39:43.477
I never understood
the idea of bringing flowers.

39:45.182 --> 39:47.309
Just for once, Bones,
do what people do.

39:47.385 --> 39:49.649
Okay? See how it feels.

39:49.720 --> 39:51.654
Come on. That's it.

39:51.722 --> 39:54.816
I'm gonna go stand over here
while you, uh, you know, talk to your mom.

39:54.892 --> 39:57.326
I told you, I don't do... that.

39:59.897 --> 40:02.297
Mmm.

40:06.036 --> 40:08.470
Mom, it's me, Temperance.

40:08.539 --> 40:10.473
[Scoffs]

40:17.314 --> 40:19.874
I have questions,
but you can't answer them.

40:19.950 --> 40:22.885
No offense, but I don't think...

40:22.953 --> 40:25.786
<i>there's anything</i>
<i>here of you but your bones so...</i>

40:25.856 --> 40:28.051
[Scoffs, Chuckles]

40:28.125 --> 40:30.616
I can't believe I'm doing this.

40:37.201 --> 40:39.362
Was Dad a good man or...

40:42.606 --> 40:44.540
a bad man?

40:47.711 --> 40:49.645
He had someone killed.

40:53.451 --> 40:56.887
Had him murdered and...
[Whimpers]

40:56.954 --> 40:59.752
<i>What's the truth? Do</i> I...

41:02.092 --> 41:05.493
Do I keep looking,
or do I let it go like he asked?

41:08.666 --> 41:10.964
Who's he protecting, himself?

41:13.304 --> 41:16.796
Or me and... Russ?

41:27.685 --> 41:30.620
[Exhales, Sighs]

41:32.423 --> 41:34.516
Booth, I asked the questions...

41:34.592 --> 41:37.288
and guess what.

41:37.361 --> 41:40.558
- No answer.
- Well, maybe if you weren't standing...

41:40.631 --> 41:43.623
right on top of her,
took a step to the left, showed a little respect.

41:43.701 --> 41:47.296
Sometimes it takes a while
to get an answer, okay?

41:47.371 --> 41:50.204
Just leave the flowers.

41:51.675 --> 41:55.042
I get answers at a lab.
You get them from people.

41:55.112 --> 41:57.637
Nobody gets answers
from a slab of stone.

41:57.715 --> 42:00.912
Yeah? I see an answer in the stone.
You buried your mother as Christine Brennan...

42:00.985 --> 42:03.283
the woman that you knew
as your mother...

42:03.354 --> 42:05.948
and not by her real name,
Ruth Keenan.

42:06.023 --> 42:07.615
That tells me who <i>you</i> are.

42:14.965 --> 42:17.456
- What do you got?
- A dolphin.

42:18.969 --> 42:22.166
<i># [Soft Rock]</i>

42:22.239 --> 42:25.572
- What does that tell you?
- What does that tell <i>you?</i>

42:26.911 --> 42:29.038
My father was here.

42:29.113 --> 42:31.081
Because he loves your mother...

42:31.148 --> 42:35.107
and grieves her loss,
and he came here to talk to her.

42:37.821 --> 42:39.755
You're tainting evidence.

42:39.823 --> 42:42.087
It's not that kind of evidence, Bones.

42:42.159 --> 42:45.322
It's evidence of something else...

42:45.396 --> 42:47.762
something that can't be tainted.

42:51.735 --> 42:55.330
<i># [Continues]</i>

43:00.911 --> 43:02.845
It's beautiful.

43:05.716 --> 43:07.650
Yeah.

43:16.360 --> 43:18.920
<i># [Ends]</i>

43:51.128 --> 43:52.527
What's that mean?
