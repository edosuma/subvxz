isn't defined anywhere

23:15.785 --> 23:17.047
in this contract.

23:17.221 --> 23:18.875
You can say
anything you want.

23:19.049 --> 23:20.355
Can't be that easy.

23:20.529 --> 23:22.966
It's not.
They'll sue, we'll argue.

23:23.140 --> 23:25.142
That's the way
the law works.

23:25.316 --> 23:26.796
It doesn't matter
what we do.

23:26.970 --> 23:28.624
Stormy Daniels came out,
Karen McDougal came out.

23:28.798 --> 23:30.147
People have moved on.

23:30.321 --> 23:33.281
Yes, but you say that he paid
for your abortion.

23:33.455 --> 23:36.371
That is
a huge difference.

23:36.545 --> 23:39.069
That will undercut his support
from the religious right.

23:39.243 --> 23:41.202
We can beat this NDA.

23:41.376 --> 23:43.770
Why now and
not a year ago?

23:45.902 --> 23:48.688
Because now it's personal.

23:48.862 --> 23:50.472
But I need your help.

23:52.909 --> 23:55.346
Let me think about it.

23:57.653 --> 24:01.178
I thought it might be
because of something I wore.

24:01.352 --> 24:03.267
But even the next day,

24:03.442 --> 24:05.574
he asked me to come
into his office.

24:05.748 --> 24:07.446
He said he was tired.

24:09.404 --> 24:11.450
He had to give
a speech that night,

24:11.624 --> 24:14.409
and I could help.

24:14.583 --> 24:17.325
He asked me to come
behind his desk.

24:17.499 --> 24:20.459
He had his pants unzipped.

24:20.633 --> 24:23.462
He wanted me to touch him.

24:23.636 --> 24:26.900
He said it was because
of the pressure,

24:27.074 --> 24:29.859
and only I-- [sobs]

24:30.033 --> 24:33.515
Only I could help.

24:37.911 --> 24:40.522
I didn't want you
to have to deal with that.

24:43.482 --> 24:45.484
But it's gotten bigger.

24:47.790 --> 24:49.792
When was this?Yesterday.

24:49.966 --> 24:52.099
She agreed to a meeting...

24:52.273 --> 24:54.536
No.

24:54.710 --> 24:57.844
When did... it happen?

24:58.018 --> 24:59.976
Uh...

25:00.150 --> 25:02.892
She started with Carl
in 1999,

25:03.066 --> 25:05.591
so it may have
started then.

25:05.765 --> 25:07.201
[gasps softly]

25:11.074 --> 25:12.859
He always said
he had to work late.

25:13.033 --> 25:14.643
[sighs]

25:14.817 --> 25:17.994
"Too many injustices.

25:18.168 --> 25:20.214
Too many..."

25:24.131 --> 25:26.829
Goddamn him.

25:27.003 --> 25:29.440
Liz, I'm really sorry.

25:36.622 --> 25:38.275
Did you know?

25:39.581 --> 25:41.322
No.

25:41.496 --> 25:44.978
Even when we were married and
I would call him to talk to him,

25:45.152 --> 25:47.546
and-and-and you would say
that he was in a meeting?

25:47.720 --> 25:49.025
Because he was in a meeting.

25:49.199 --> 25:50.940
But you asked
how my parents were doing

25:51.114 --> 25:53.639
the first year we were married.
I remember you asked. Why?

25:53.813 --> 25:55.292
I don't know. I just asked.

25:55.466 --> 25:57.512
[sighs]

26:11.482 --> 26:13.310
I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry, Liz.

26:13.484 --> 26:15.312
[stammers]

26:15.486 --> 26:17.880
[crying]: I could
always accept it,

26:18.054 --> 26:20.622
the way he treated Mom,

26:20.796 --> 26:23.930
the way he treated us,

26:24.104 --> 26:27.020
because we were sharing
him with the world.

26:27.194 --> 26:29.413
I thought he was
here fighting,

26:29.588 --> 26:30.980
but he was
just here...

26:31.154 --> 26:34.549
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

26:34.723 --> 26:36.725
Come on, come on, come on.

26:39.119 --> 26:41.251
I want you to go home.

26:41.425 --> 26:44.733
We've got this. Okay?

26:44.907 --> 26:47.649
You put in the glass walls.

26:47.823 --> 26:49.608
What?The offices.

26:49.782 --> 26:51.566
Why did you do that?What-what do,
what do you mean?

26:51.740 --> 26:53.307
You knew.No, no.

26:53.481 --> 26:55.875
You were trying to stop him
from fucking around.

26:56.049 --> 26:57.833
No.
Yes.

26:58.007 --> 27:00.270
You knew, a-and it was
the year before

27:00.444 --> 27:02.316
you agreed to settle
any harassment claims.

27:02.490 --> 27:04.579
Liz, that was boilerplate...I remember, I remember

27:04.753 --> 27:06.799
Dad complaining about it at
the time, about the glass walls,

27:06.973 --> 27:08.801
about the-the lack of privacy.

27:08.975 --> 27:11.760
You got to stop this. It was a
design choice, Liz, that's all.

27:13.457 --> 27:16.547
So what are we doing?
Huh? We paying her off?

27:16.722 --> 27:18.332
I don't know, Liz.
That's...

27:18.506 --> 27:20.116
We're discussing.

27:20.290 --> 27:23.903
That's where you all were
last night, "discussing"?

27:24.077 --> 27:25.252
Liz.

27:25.426 --> 27:28.559
Liz, please, go home.
We got this.

27:28.734 --> 27:30.605
[indistinct chatter]

27:30.779 --> 27:32.346
I'm a partner.
Bring me up to speed.

27:32.520 --> 27:33.739
Let's go.[chatter stops]

27:33.913 --> 27:36.611
Don't look to Adrian,
look to me.

27:36.785 --> 27:38.047
We're talking amounts.

27:38.221 --> 27:40.441
Good. Let's hear it.

27:42.661 --> 27:43.879
Excuse me.

27:44.053 --> 27:46.795
[clears throat]
We're, uh...

27:46.969 --> 27:50.581
Well, Wendy was here for most of
the conversation about payouts,

27:50.756 --> 27:53.541
and, uh, we were talking
about as high as $750,000.

27:53.715 --> 27:54.760
Wait, Wendy?

27:54.934 --> 27:57.153
The stenographer.

28:00.200 --> 28:03.769
So, um, we think we
can pay off Cynthia

28:03.943 --> 28:06.467
for $80,000; that
is the equivalent

28:06.641 --> 28:09.078
of her...
prorated pension,

28:09.252 --> 28:12.429
and then maybe go
as high as $100,000

28:12.603 --> 28:14.605
for... Wendy.

28:17.173 --> 28:19.523
My dad raped the stenographer?

28:19.698 --> 28:21.612
Yes.

28:26.313 --> 28:28.271
Okay.

28:31.057 --> 28:32.667
Well, I'll make the deal
with Cynthia.

28:32.841 --> 28:34.364
Liz, let us do it.No.

28:34.538 --> 28:36.627
I will do it.

28:37.628 --> 28:39.152
Jay.
Yep?

28:41.589 --> 28:43.199
Never mind.

28:46.463 --> 28:47.377
Marissa.

28:47.551 --> 28:48.683
Okay, I'll get on it.

28:48.857 --> 28:50.163
Yes, Ms. Reddick?

28:50.337 --> 28:52.382
You know what's going on here?

28:52.556 --> 28:54.602
About my father
raping secretaries?

28:55.603 --> 28:57.257
Yes.
All right.

28:57.431 --> 28:59.563
I want you to find out
if there are any more.

28:59.738 --> 29:01.087
Any more...?
Women...

29:01.261 --> 29:02.697
that he's raped.

29:02.871 --> 29:05.308
In the firm, in the world.

29:05.482 --> 29:08.181
I want to know everything,
so don't bury it.

29:10.705 --> 29:12.663
And you don't go
to anybody else first.

29:12.838 --> 29:15.449
You come to me, okay?Okay.

29:22.195 --> 29:23.631
ADRIAN:
Thank you, Lucca,

29:23.805 --> 29:25.111
for giving us the time.

29:25.285 --> 29:26.852
If this is about
my maternity leave,

29:27.026 --> 29:28.767
I know I'm behind
on billable hours.

29:28.941 --> 29:30.551
No, actually it's
something else.

29:30.725 --> 29:32.422
Can we get you anything?
Water?

29:32.596 --> 29:35.077
Or anything?No, I'm all right.

29:35.251 --> 29:36.862
What's wrong?What do you mean?

29:37.036 --> 29:39.429
It feels like
I'm about to be fired.ADRIAN: No.

29:39.603 --> 29:40.909
In fact, consider this
a promotion.

29:41.083 --> 29:43.782
[chuckles]

29:43.956 --> 29:45.479
ADRIAN: We've been
looking for somebody

29:45.653 --> 29:47.046
to take over
divorce law.

29:47.220 --> 29:48.525
We don't have
a lot of cases,

29:48.699 --> 29:50.353
but we're trying
to build the department.

29:50.527 --> 29:52.616
I thought you hired
Bruce Fischer.ADRIAN: We did.

29:52.791 --> 29:53.879
It was an issue.

29:54.053 --> 29:55.924
Harassment issues
at his last firm.

29:56.098 --> 29:58.971
And that's a problem these days?
[laughs]

30:00.494 --> 30:02.757
We want a woman
in the position.

30:02.931 --> 30:05.238
Well, a month ago,
you wanted a man.

30:05.412 --> 30:07.327
Well, we changed our minds.

30:07.501 --> 30:09.503
Well, I'm on the Leland suit;
it's a full load, so...

30:09.677 --> 30:12.201
Yeah, you-you'd
have to drop that.

30:12.375 --> 30:14.508
You really should
consider this, Lucca.

30:18.599 --> 30:20.166
Diane?

30:20.340 --> 30:22.385
Uh, was that an invitation
or a demand?

30:22.559 --> 30:23.865
Well, that's up to you.

30:24.039 --> 30:25.824
[scoffs] Divorce
is a dead end here.

30:25.998 --> 30:27.651
No one takes it seriously.

30:27.826 --> 30:30.480
Well, then, do it temporarily
and see if you like it.

30:30.654 --> 30:32.656
Uh... [chuckles]

30:37.096 --> 30:39.489
ADRIAN: Hey, Maia.Mr. Boseman.

30:39.663 --> 30:41.535
Hi, sir.

30:41.709 --> 30:43.537
Hello.

30:43.711 --> 30:46.409
I heard you were upset
about the website?

30:49.108 --> 30:50.979
Uh, no, sir, no.
It's just that, uh,

30:51.153 --> 30:52.633
I have a scratched cornea,

30:52.807 --> 30:54.504
so it is sensitive
to light...
Look, look.

30:54.678 --> 30:56.376
Know that this is
not a reflection

30:56.550 --> 30:57.768
of how we feel
about you.

30:57.943 --> 30:59.814
It's a branding thing.
[chuckles]

30:59.988 --> 31:01.424
So don't worry.I'm not worried.

31:01.598 --> 31:02.599
You keep up
the good work.

31:02.773 --> 31:03.818
I will.All right.

31:09.650 --> 31:11.478
MARISSA: What are
you looking at?

31:11.652 --> 31:13.784
[clears throat]
My arm.

31:13.959 --> 31:16.700
Your arm?
What's that mean?

31:16.875 --> 31:18.398
I was in this group photo,

31:18.572 --> 31:20.617
and they cropped me out.

31:20.791 --> 31:22.619
Well, I'm sure that
wasn't intentional.

31:22.793 --> 31:24.317
It's a nice arm.

31:24.491 --> 31:27.537
Enough people have told me
not to be bothered by this,

31:27.711 --> 31:29.235
I'm starting
to get bothered by this.

31:29.409 --> 31:30.889
Well, don't cry.

31:32.891 --> 31:34.631
I'm a third-year associate,

31:34.805 --> 31:37.199
and they are treating me
like I was hired yesterday.

31:43.379 --> 31:45.338
It's the curse
of short people.

31:47.340 --> 31:49.559
We were born in
the volcano of Vulcan

31:49.733 --> 31:51.344
as a powerful army
to control the Earth,

31:51.518 --> 31:53.433
but Vulcan blessed
and cursed us

31:53.607 --> 31:55.391
with one
unfortunate attribute:

31:55.565 --> 31:58.525
for all time,
we are to be overlooked.

31:58.699 --> 32:00.309
Why do you think
I talk so loud

32:00.483 --> 32:02.137
and make jokes
out of being blunt?

32:02.311 --> 32:03.617
Why?

32:03.791 --> 32:05.140
Because it allows me
to control people

32:05.314 --> 32:06.663
without them thinking
they're being controlled.

32:06.837 --> 32:08.665
It's Jedi mind shit.
You can do the same.

32:08.839 --> 32:10.450
Okay.

32:10.624 --> 32:12.626
How?
Your voice.

32:12.800 --> 32:14.323
You have to make it louder
but without cracking.

32:14.497 --> 32:16.151
Say, "these aren't the briefs
you're looking for."

32:16.325 --> 32:18.110
Do you think
I'm joking?

32:18.284 --> 32:19.676
Fucking say it.
But say it loud

32:19.850 --> 32:21.504
and strong and don't let
your voice crack.

32:22.549 --> 32:24.072
[clears throat]

32:24.246 --> 32:26.118
These aren't the briefs
you're looking for.

32:26.292 --> 32:27.989
No. Come on.

32:29.991 --> 32:31.993
No?
Come on!

32:32.167 --> 32:33.429
No...

32:33.603 --> 32:34.778
[door closes]

32:34.953 --> 32:36.432
Okay.

32:36.606 --> 32:38.173
[exhales] These aren't
the briefs you're looking for.

32:38.347 --> 32:39.696
Say it.Give me something else.

32:39.870 --> 32:42.134
No! Fucking say it.
Yes, I'm swearing.

32:43.657 --> 32:45.180
These aren't the briefs
you're looking for.

32:45.354 --> 32:46.616
You're straining
your voice.

32:46.790 --> 32:49.010
Make it loud, but
don't strain. Go.

32:49.184 --> 32:51.273
These aren't the briefs
you're looking for!

32:51.447 --> 32:52.274
Better.

[toilet flushing]

32:57.062 --> 32:58.193
[mouthing]

33:00.195 --> 33:01.980
No, don't wash your
hands, tall lady.

33:02.154 --> 33:05.026
Get the fuck out.

33:05.200 --> 33:06.462
[door opens, closes]

33:06.636 --> 33:08.247
Okay, this is my gift
to you, Maia.

33:08.421 --> 33:10.727
What?

33:14.340 --> 33:16.559
[gasps]
These are cool.

33:16.733 --> 33:18.779
And if you don't
use them correctly,

33:18.953 --> 33:20.476
I'm taking them back.
And give me these.

33:20.650 --> 33:22.696
Jesus Christ.

33:28.354 --> 33:30.573
[sighs]How's that?

33:30.747 --> 33:31.835
Good.

33:32.010 --> 33:34.012
Hmm.Now make us proud.

[elevator bell dings]

33:43.282 --> 33:45.284
[inhales sharply]

33:52.987 --> 33:54.641
Do I know you?

33:54.815 --> 33:56.425
No.

33:56.599 --> 33:58.210
I'm Roger.

34:00.212 --> 34:02.997
What's... your name?

34:03.171 --> 34:04.912
Maia.

34:05.086 --> 34:07.523
It's nice
to meet you, Maia.

34:07.697 --> 34:10.657
I'm working
at your firm temporarily.

34:12.659 --> 34:14.008
Want to grab
a drink tonight?

34:14.182 --> 34:16.184
[chuckles softly]

34:16.358 --> 34:17.577
No.
