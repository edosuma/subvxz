00:40.300 --> 00:41.367
WELCOME TO "LAST WEEK TONIGHT."

00:41.367 --> 00:42.500
I'M JOHN OLIVER.

00:42.500 --> 00:43.533
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING

00:43.533 --> 00:43.934
US.

00:43.934 --> 00:44.834
JUST TIME FOR A QUICK RECAP OF

00:44.834 --> 00:45.867
THE WEEK.

00:45.867 --> 00:46.734
AND WE BEGIN WITH THE TRUMP

00:46.734 --> 00:47.734
WHITE HOUSE WHERE EVERY MORNING

00:47.734 --> 00:48.667
JARED KUSHNER SLAMS A DOOR AND

00:48.667 --> 00:49.800
YELLS "OH, YEAH, WELL, YOU DON'T

00:49.800 --> 00:50.834
HAVE CLEARANCE TO HEAR MY

00:50.834 --> 00:53.166
SECRETS!"

00:53.166 --> 00:57.500
IT WAS ANOTHER HEAD-SPINNING

00:57.500 --> 01:00.200
WEEK IN THE WHITE HOUSE,

01:00.200 --> 01:00.967
FROM THE DEPARTURE OF

01:00.967 --> 01:02.333
CHIEF ECONOMIC ADVISER

01:02.333 --> 01:03.233
GARY COHN TO THE CONTINUING SAGA

01:03.233 --> 01:06.233
OF STORMY DANIELS TO THE FACT

01:06.233 --> 01:07.266
THAT, ON THURSDAY, TRUMP

01:07.266 --> 01:08.000
ANNOUNCED PLANS FOR A HISTORIC

01:08.000 --> 01:09.033
SUMMIT WITH KIM JONG UN.

01:09.033 --> 01:09.900
THIS SEEMINGLY CAME OUT OF

01:09.900 --> 01:10.734
NOWHERE.

01:10.734 --> 01:11.767
APPARENTLY, SOUTH KOREAN

01:11.767 --> 01:12.567
OFFICIALS HAD DELIVERED HIM A

01:12.567 --> 01:13.500
MESSAGE THAT KIM JONG UN WAS

01:13.500 --> 01:14.800
OPEN TO A MEETING, AND THEN THIS

01:14.800 --> 01:15.467
HAPPENED.

01:15.467 --> 01:16.467
>> "THE WALL STREET JOURNAL"

01:16.467 --> 01:17.867
REPORTS PRESIDENT TRUMP

01:17.867 --> 01:18.834
INTERRUPTED A CONVERSATION

01:18.834 --> 01:19.867
BETWEEN SOUTH KOREAN OFFICIALS

01:19.867 --> 01:21.967
AND SAID, "OKAY, OKAY, TELL THEM

01:21.967 --> 01:24.667
I'LL DO IT."

01:24.667 --> 01:26.133
THE SOUTH KOREAN OFFICIALS

01:26.133 --> 01:28.266
LOOKED AT EACH OTHER AS IF IN

01:28.266 --> 01:29.600
DISBELIEF, ACCORDING TO A

01:29.600 --> 01:32.033
WHITE HOUSE OFFICIAL WITH

01:32.033 --> 01:32.867
KNOWLEDGE OF THE MEETING.

01:32.867 --> 01:33.700
"TELL HIM YES," THE PRESIDENT

01:33.700 --> 01:34.500
SAID."

01:34.500 --> 01:35.567
>> John: AND THAT WAS IT!

01:35.567 --> 01:36.700
HE BROKE WITH DECADES OF

01:36.700 --> 01:37.567
PRECEDENT WITH ALL THE STRATEGIC

01:37.567 --> 01:38.734
FORETHOUGHT YOU'D PUT INTO

01:38.734 --> 01:42.867
TAKING A SAMPLE AT COSTCO.

01:42.867 --> 01:43.266
"OH, SALMON JERKY?

01:43.266 --> 01:43.967
FUCK IT, LET'S DO IT.

01:43.967 --> 01:45.033
IF I DON'T LIKE IT, IT'S NOT

01:45.033 --> 01:50.100
LIKE IT'S THE END OF THE WORLD."

01:50.100 --> 01:52.100
AND, LOOK, WHO KNOWS IF THE

01:52.100 --> 01:52.900
SUMMIT'S EVEN GOING TO HAPPEN?

01:52.900 --> 01:53.834
BY THE NEXT DAY, THEY WERE

01:53.834 --> 01:55.533
WALKING IT BACK, BECAUSE NOTHING

01:55.533 --> 01:56.900
TRUMP SAYS MEANS ANYTHING.

01:56.900 --> 01:57.967
BUT THAT NORTH KOREA NEWS

01:57.967 --> 01:58.967
DISTRACTED FROM SOMETHING ELSE

01:58.967 --> 01:59.667
HAPPENING ON THURSDAY:

01:59.667 --> 02:00.867
INTERNATIONAL WOMEN'S DAY.

02:00.867 --> 02:04.934
THAT ONE SPECIAL DAY A YEAR FOR

02:04.934 --> 02:06.367
HALF THE POPULATION OF EARTH.

02:06.367 --> 02:07.934
KNOCK YOURSELVES OUT,

02:07.934 --> 02:12.133
3.5 BILLION PEOPLE.

02:12.600 --> 02:13.367
IT WAS A DAY OF MARCHES ALL OVER

02:13.367 --> 02:14.433
THE WORLD IN SUPPORT OF CAUSES

02:14.433 --> 02:15.166
FROM EQUAL PAY TO COMBATING

02:15.166 --> 02:18.233
SEXUAL HARASSMENT, ALL OF WHICH

02:18.233 --> 02:19.100
WERE TRULY INSPIRING.

02:19.100 --> 02:19.934
WHAT WAS DISPIRITING WAS THAT,

02:19.934 --> 02:20.900
YET AGAIN, INTERNATIONAL

02:20.900 --> 02:22.133
WOMEN'S DAY INSPIRED REACTIONS

02:22.133 --> 02:23.367
RANGING FROM CLUMSY TO

02:23.367 --> 02:25.400
APPALLING, STARTING WITH THE

02:25.400 --> 02:26.667
HAM-FISTED EFFORTS OF BRANDS

02:26.667 --> 02:28.433
TRYING TO APPEAR LIKE

02:28.433 --> 02:30.000
PROGRESSIVE FEMINISTS.

02:30.000 --> 02:31.700
McDONALD'S TURNED ITS "M"

02:31.700 --> 02:34.467
UPSIDE DOWN --

02:34.467 --> 02:35.500
YOU KNOW, FOR WOMEN, BECAUSE I

02:35.500 --> 02:37.700
GUESS THE "M" IS FOR MEN THE

02:37.700 --> 02:38.734
REST OF THE TIME.

02:38.734 --> 02:39.967
PORSCHE NONSENSICALLY BLACKED

02:39.967 --> 02:41.166
OUT THE LETTERS IN THEIR LOGO

02:41.166 --> 02:42.433
UNTIL IT READ "SHE,"

02:42.433 --> 02:43.800
AND THEN THERE WAS BRAWNY,

02:43.800 --> 02:45.066
WHO RAN A "WHO'S YOUR SHERO?"

02:45.066 --> 02:46.433
CAMPAIGN.

02:46.433 --> 02:47.934
>> BRAWNY CELEBRATES SHEROES

02:47.934 --> 02:49.100
THIS WOMEN'S HISTORY MONTH, AND

02:49.100 --> 02:50.066
SUPPORTS GIRLS INC. TO INSPIRE

02:50.066 --> 02:51.900
SHEROES OF TOMORROW.

02:51.900 --> 02:56.100
WHO'S YOUR SHERO?

02:56.100 --> 03:00.233
>> John: NOW, THE ONLY PROBLEM

03:00.233 --> 03:02.200
WITH THAT IS THAT WE CONSULTED

03:02.200 --> 03:02.834
SOME LINGUISTICS EXPERTS, AND IT

03:02.834 --> 03:03.734
TURNS OUT -- AND THIS IS TRUE --

03:03.734 --> 03:04.567
THAT'S THERE'S ALREADY A WORD

03:04.567 --> 03:05.600
FOR "WOMEN HEROES."

03:05.600 --> 03:06.767
AND IT'S THE WORD "HEROES."

03:06.767 --> 03:07.500
IT'S A LITTLE LIKE THE WORD

03:07.500 --> 03:08.667
"SHEROES," ONLY IT'S NOT STUPID

03:08.667 --> 03:10.333
AND IT IS A WORD.

03:10.333 --> 03:12.200
NOW, MATTEL FARED A LITTLE

03:12.200 --> 03:13.066
BETTER WITH THEIR NEW LINE OF

03:13.066 --> 03:14.133
"INSPIRING WOMEN" BARBIE DOLLS.

03:14.133 --> 03:15.400
IT'S A NICE IDEA.

03:15.400 --> 03:16.400
THE PROBLEM THERE WAS THAT ONE

03:16.400 --> 03:17.734
LOCAL NEWSCASTER SOMEHOW FOUND A

03:17.734 --> 03:20.300
WAY TO MAKE IT CREEPY.

03:20.300 --> 03:21.433
>> THE THREE INSPIRING WOMEN

03:21.433 --> 03:22.834
DOLLS ARE AVIATOR

03:22.834 --> 03:24.333
AMELIA EARHART, ARTIST

03:24.333 --> 03:25.467
FRIDA KAHLO, AND MATHEMATICIAN

03:25.467 --> 03:27.767
KATHERINE JOHNSON.

03:27.767 --> 03:29.667
>> I LOVE THE FRIDA KAHLO ONE.

03:29.667 --> 03:30.633
SHE'S DRESSED -- LOVE IT.

03:30.633 --> 03:31.567
>> SALMA HAYEK, RIGHT, THE

03:31.567 --> 03:32.533
MOVIE?

03:32.533 --> 03:33.533
>> YEAH, THERE YOU GO.

03:33.533 --> 03:35.433
YOU LIKE THAT MOVIE, YEAH?

03:35.433 --> 03:36.467
>> OH, YEAH.

03:36.467 --> 03:37.166
SALMA HAYEK.

03:37.166 --> 03:38.100
I LIKE SALMA.

03:38.100 --> 03:39.300
I LIKE SALMA.

03:39.300 --> 03:40.367
>> OH, YOU LIKE SALMA, OKAY.

03:40.367 --> 03:41.266
>> John: IT WAS A SEGMENT ABOUT

03:41.266 --> 03:42.200
WOMEN'S EMPOWERMENT, CHILDREN'S

03:42.200 --> 03:43.800
TOYS, AND A LONG-DEAD ARTIST.

03:43.800 --> 03:45.066
BUT HE DECIDED,

03:45.066 --> 03:46.300
"I CAN PERV OUT ON THIS.

03:46.300 --> 03:47.533
I WILL PERV OUT ON THIS.

03:47.533 --> 03:48.467
WITH GOD AS MY WITNESS, I WILL

03:48.467 --> 03:51.200
MAKE THIS WOMEN'S DAY SEGMENT

03:51.200 --> 03:55.233
ABOUT MY DICK."

03:55.233 --> 03:56.867
AND THAT WAS NOT THE ONLY

03:56.867 --> 03:59.000
AWKWARD INTERACTION AT A TV NEWS

03:59.000 --> 03:59.600
DESK ON THURSDAY.

03:59.600 --> 04:00.467
STEP FORWARD,

04:00.467 --> 04:01.467
"CBS THIS MORNING," A SHOW THAT

04:01.467 --> 04:02.200
RECENTLY FIRED CHARLIE ROSE

04:02.200 --> 04:03.033
FOLLOWING SEXUAL HARASSMENT

04:03.033 --> 04:03.900
ALLEGATIONS.

04:03.900 --> 04:05.000
AND YET, THEY STILL TRANSITIONED

04:05.000 --> 04:06.066
FROM A SEGMENT ABOUT

04:06.066 --> 04:06.967
DOG BEHAVIOR TO A SEGMENT ABOUT

04:06.967 --> 04:08.166
INTERNATIONAL WOMEN'S DAY LIKE

04:08.166 --> 04:09.767
THIS.

04:09.767 --> 04:11.734
>> RESEARCHERS SAY IT'S KIND OF

04:11.734 --> 04:13.500
LIKE SPEAKING TO YOUR DOG THE

04:13.500 --> 04:15.100
WAY YOU DO TO A BABY, BUT DON'T

04:15.100 --> 04:15.967
MISTAKE THE TWO.

04:15.967 --> 04:17.333
>> YES.

04:17.333 --> 04:18.300
>> COME HERE, YOU LITTLE SWEETIE

04:18.300 --> 04:19.100
PIE.

04:19.100 --> 04:20.200
DON'T YOU LOOK SO CUTE?

04:20.200 --> 04:21.967
>> OH, MY GOD, I JUST WANT TO BE

04:21.967 --> 04:24.934
IN YOUR LAP, NORAH.

04:24.934 --> 04:26.900
>>

04:26.900 --> 04:28.300
>> YOU KNOW YOU TWO ARE NOT

04:28.300 --> 04:28.900
ALONE?

04:28.900 --> 04:29.934
THERE'S PEOPLE IN THE ROOM.

04:29.934 --> 04:31.233
>> John: YEAH, GAYLE'S RIGHT.

04:31.233 --> 04:32.066
THERE ARE PEOPLE IN THE ROOM.

04:32.066 --> 04:32.800
ALTHOUGH MAYBE WE SHOULD FOCUS

04:32.800 --> 04:36.467
ON WHO'S NOT IN THE ROOM.

04:36.467 --> 04:38.467
LET'S ASK OURSELVES WHO IS NOT

04:38.467 --> 04:40.667
IN THAT ROOM, AND HOW DID HE

04:40.667 --> 04:42.033
COME TO BE NOT IN THE ROOM?

04:42.033 --> 04:42.967
I'M JUST SAYING, IT SEEMS

04:42.967 --> 04:43.834
THAT "CBS THIS MORNING" IS LESS

04:43.834 --> 04:44.667
A MORNING SHOW AND MORE TWO

04:44.667 --> 04:45.867
HOURS OF INCRIMINATING OFFICE

04:45.867 --> 04:46.400
SURVEILLANCE FOOTAGE THAT

04:46.400 --> 04:47.300
ACCIDENTALLY GETS BROADCAST

04:47.300 --> 04:48.867
ACROSS THE COUNTRY EVERY DAY.

04:48.867 --> 04:49.667
BUT THOSE WERE ALL ONE-OFF

04:49.667 --> 04:51.967
MOMENTS.

04:51.967 --> 04:53.333
SOME NEWS ANCHORS WERE SPENDING

04:53.333 --> 04:54.367
THE ENTIRE DAY ACTING

04:54.367 --> 04:55.433
INAPPROPRIATELY, LIKE

04:55.433 --> 04:56.533
PHILADELPHIA'S MIKE JERRICK.

04:56.533 --> 04:57.934
NOW, WE DON'T HAVE TIME TO SHOW

04:57.934 --> 05:01.467
YOU EVERYTHING HE DID.

05:01.467 --> 05:03.100
THIS IS JUST A SAMPLE OF WHAT HE

05:03.100 --> 05:04.300
GOT UP TO ON THURSDAY.

05:04.300 --> 05:05.166
>> HAVE A GREAT DAY.

05:05.166 --> 05:06.600
INTERNATIONAL WOMEN'S --

05:06.600 --> 05:07.700
WHAT'S THE DEAL, WHY DO YOU

05:07.700 --> 05:09.166
NEED YOUR OWN DAY?

05:09.166 --> 05:11.000
THEY CHANGED THE BRAWNY DUDE TO

05:11.000 --> 05:15.000
A WOMAN.

05:15.000 --> 05:15.200
YEAH.

05:15.200 --> 05:16.533
JUST GIVE ME SOME IDEAS --

05:16.533 --> 05:17.667
HOW CAN WE CHANGE THAT TO

05:17.667 --> 05:18.800
SOMETHING GOOD TO

05:18.800 --> 05:20.300
CELEBRATE WOMEN?

05:20.300 --> 05:22.100
IT'S GREAT.

05:22.100 --> 05:23.166
YOU'LL LOVE IT.

05:23.166 --> 05:24.467
HOW DO YOU KEEP YOUR GIRLISH

05:24.467 --> 05:25.633
FIGURE?

05:25.633 --> 05:27.166
HAVE YOU EVER CHEATED ON YOUR

05:27.166 --> 05:27.900
HUSBAND?

05:27.900 --> 05:29.100
>> NO.

05:29.100 --> 05:30.000
>> OKAY.

05:30.000 --> 05:31.000
>> LAST TIME YOU HAD SEX?

05:31.000 --> 05:32.333
>> MIKE!

05:32.333 --> 05:34.667
>> IT'S THE ALEX HOLLEY.

05:34.667 --> 05:35.533
TURN IT AROUND.

05:35.533 --> 05:36.700
WHAT?

05:36.700 --> 05:38.066
IT'S SO AUTHENTIC IT HAS A MIC

05:38.066 --> 05:38.934
PACK ON IT.

05:38.934 --> 05:40.667
WHAT DO YOU DO WITH THIS DOLL

05:40.667 --> 05:44.233
THAT YOU HAVE AT HOME?

05:44.233 --> 05:45.400
>> I PUT IT BY MY BEDSIDE TABLE,

05:45.400 --> 05:46.066
SO I CAN WAKE UP, OPEN MY EYES,

05:46.066 --> 05:46.967
AND SEE YOU.

05:46.967 --> 05:47.900
>> John: THAT IS GROSS.

05:47.900 --> 05:49.066
AND I'D SAY WE SHOULD ALL NOW

05:49.066 --> 05:50.033
TAKE A SHOWER AFTER THAT, BUT I

05:50.033 --> 05:51.367
FEEL LIKE MIKE JERRICK WOULD

05:51.367 --> 05:52.633
HEAR THAT AND SAY "NOICE."

05:52.633 --> 05:53.967
BUT PERHAPS THE WORST MOMENTS

05:53.967 --> 05:55.166
THIS WOMEN'S DAY WERE FROM MALE

05:55.166 --> 05:56.934
POLITICIANS.

05:56.934 --> 05:58.900
IN THE U.K., BORIS JOHNSON,

05:58.900 --> 06:00.433
FOREIGN SECRETARY AND DUMPY

06:00.433 --> 06:03.400
SWEDISH BEETLE, CELEBRATED THE

06:03.400 --> 06:07.834
DAY BY VISITING SCHOOLCHILDREN,

06:07.834 --> 06:09.900
WHICH IS A PERFECTLY PLEASANT

06:09.900 --> 06:10.100
IDEA.

06:10.100 --> 06:11.166
BUT WHEN YOU TURN UP THE AUDIO,

06:11.166 --> 06:11.800
THE SUBJECT OF CLEOPATRA

06:11.800 --> 06:12.667
APPARENTLY CAME UP, AND JOHNSON

06:12.667 --> 06:13.533
DECIDED TO TELL THE KIDS --

06:13.533 --> 06:17.200
UNPROMPTED -- HOW SHE DIED.

06:17.200 --> 06:19.867
>> SHE -- SHE GETS SOME SNAKES

06:19.867 --> 06:21.433
BROUGHT IN IN A BASKET OF FIGS

06:21.433 --> 06:22.700
AND SHE -- SHE WANTED TO COMMIT

06:22.700 --> 06:24.233
SUICIDE BECAUSE ANTONY WAS DEAD.

06:24.233 --> 06:26.433
AND SHE LOVED ANTONY.

06:26.433 --> 06:29.066
AND SO SHE TOOK OUT THE SNAKE,

06:29.066 --> 06:31.734
WHICH WAS CALLED AN ASP, AND SHE

06:31.734 --> 06:32.734
PUT IT ON HER BOSOM AND THEN SHE

06:32.734 --> 06:34.967
DIED.

06:34.967 --> 06:36.233
AND THAT WAS THE END OF

06:36.233 --> 06:42.000
CLEOPATRA.

06:42.000 --> 06:44.100
>> John: WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

06:44.100 --> 06:45.300
I WOULD HAPPILY WATCH HOURS OF

06:45.300 --> 06:46.367
BORIS JOHNSON EXPLAINING GRIM

06:46.367 --> 06:47.700
ENDINGS TO DISTRACTED CHILDREN.

06:47.700 --> 06:48.867
"SO THEN SARA LOSES HER MIND,

06:48.867 --> 06:50.633
HARRY HAS HIS ARM AMPUTATED, AND

06:50.633 --> 06:51.700
MARION PERFORMS A SEX SHOW FOR

06:51.700 --> 06:52.333
DRUGS.

06:52.333 --> 06:56.700
AND THAT WAS THE END OF

06:56.700 --> 06:58.333
'REQUIEM FOR A DREAM,'

06:58.333 --> 07:00.400
CHILDREN."

07:00.400 --> 07:01.767
ALSO, KUDOS TO THAT KID WHO GAVE

07:01.767 --> 07:03.066
HIM A THUMBS-UP AT THE END OF

07:03.066 --> 07:03.800
THAT STORY.

07:03.800 --> 07:04.600
"GREAT JOB, BORIS.

07:04.600 --> 07:05.433
CAN'T WAIT TO GO HOME AND ASK MY

07:05.433 --> 07:06.533
MOM WHAT BOSOMS AND SUICIDE

07:06.533 --> 07:08.633
ARE."

07:08.633 --> 07:10.333
AND FRANKLY, WHO BETTER TO END

07:10.333 --> 07:11.133
THIS ROUNDUP OF INTERNATIONAL

07:11.133 --> 07:12.233
WOMEN'S DAY THAN VLADIMIR PUTIN?

07:12.233 --> 07:12.867
THIS YEAR, IN HIS ANNUAL SPEECH

07:12.867 --> 07:13.767
CELEBRATING WOMEN, HE DECIDED TO

07:13.767 --> 07:15.166
READ A RUSSIAN LOVE POEM THAT

07:15.166 --> 07:16.166
FEATURED SOME TRULY UNFORTUNATE

07:16.166 --> 07:20.033
SENTIMENTS.

07:20.033 --> 07:21.200
>> IT IS A WOMAN'S SOUL THAT

07:21.200 --> 07:23.967
CONQUERS US.

07:23.967 --> 07:25.600
WHEN SHE IS YOUNG, WHEN SHE'S A

07:25.600 --> 07:26.533
MOTHER, AND EVEN WHEN HER HAIR

07:26.533 --> 07:29.100
GOES GRAY.

07:29.100 --> 07:30.934
>> John: "EVEN WHEN HER HAIR

07:30.934 --> 07:32.300
GOES GRAY."

07:32.300 --> 07:33.667
THAT IS BOTH A BIZARRE SENTIMENT

07:33.667 --> 07:35.000
AND A VERY WEIRD SUMMARY OF ANY

07:35.000 --> 07:37.900
WOMAN'S LIFE.

07:37.900 --> 07:39.900
"FIRST SHE IS CHILD, THEN SHE

07:39.900 --> 07:41.000
MAKES CHILD, THEN SHE CHANGES

07:41.000 --> 07:43.100
COLOR.

07:43.100 --> 07:44.867
SHE IS LIKE BANANA, IF BANANA

07:44.867 --> 07:46.767
MAKE OTHER BANANAS.

07:46.767 --> 07:48.333
WHAT I AM TRYING TO SAY IS,

07:48.333 --> 07:50.100
HAPPY INTERNATIONAL WOMEN'S DAY,

07:50.100 --> 07:53.200
YOU ETERNALLY FUCKABLE BANANAS."

07:53.200 --> 07:54.367
I'M JUST SAYING, IN THE

07:54.367 --> 07:56.200
EXTREMELY UNLIKELY EVENT

07:56.200 --> 07:57.767
THAT VLADIMIR PUTIN LOSES HIS

07:57.767 --> 07:59.100
UPCOMING ELECTION, THERE MIGHT

07:59.100 --> 08:01.266
BE A MORNING NEWS JOB IN PHILLY

08:01.266 --> 08:02.834
HE WOULD BE PERFECT FOR.

08:02.834 --> 08:05.967
AND NOW THIS...

08:05.967 --> 08:07.767
>> AND NOW, AN MSNBC GUEST

08:07.767 --> 08:09.233
BROUGHT ON TO DISCUSS

08:09.233 --> 08:12.266
GARY COHN'S DEPARTURE CAN'T GET

08:12.266 --> 08:16.633
OVER THE "BACHELOR"

08:16.633 --> 08:17.867
FINALE.

08:17.867 --> 08:19.300
>> IT COMES DOWN TO TWO WOMEN,

08:19.300 --> 08:23.467
HE IS GOING TO PICK THE OTHER

08:23.467 --> 08:24.367
ONE, THEN HE PICKS THE

08:24.367 --> 08:25.800
OTHER ONE, IT'S THE BLONDE AND

08:25.800 --> 08:26.533
THE BRUNETTE, SO HE PICKS THE

08:26.533 --> 08:27.367
BRUNETTE.

08:27.367 --> 08:28.400
AND THEN HE PROPOSES TO HER,

08:28.400 --> 08:29.433
GETS DOWN ON ONE KNEE, AND THEN

08:29.433 --> 08:30.834
IT GOES TO THE HOST, CHRIS

08:30.834 --> 08:32.233
HARRISON, WHO SAYS, BUT THIS IS

08:32.233 --> 08:34.500
NOT THE END OF THIS STORY.

08:34.500 --> 08:35.800
SO THEN THE BACHELOR SAYS HE

08:35.800 --> 08:37.200
CAN'T STOP THINKING ABOUT THE

08:37.200 --> 08:38.266
BLONDE.

08:38.266 --> 08:40.333
>> OH, MY GOD.

08:40.333 --> 08:41.800
>> AND THEN THE BRUNETTE COMES

08:41.800 --> 08:46.000
TO SPEND THE WEEKEND WITH HIM

08:46.000 --> 08:47.734
IN SOME HOUSE THEY RENTED FOR

08:47.734 --> 08:48.600
THEM IN LOS ANGELES, AND HE SITS

08:48.600 --> 08:49.834
HER DOWN, AND THEN THEY SAY,

08:49.834 --> 08:51.300
THIS IS THE MOST DRAMATIC THING

08:51.300 --> 08:52.100
IN "BACHELOR" HISTORY, WE'RE

08:52.100 --> 08:53.433
GOING TO SHOW YOU UNEDITED WHAT

08:53.433 --> 08:59.033
HAPPENED.

08:59.033 --> 09:02.467
SO THEY HAD A CAMERA ON HIM,

09:02.467 --> 09:04.500
A CAMERA ON HER.

09:04.500 --> 09:05.066
AND HE SAYS, I'M BREAKING UP

09:05.066 --> 09:06.433
WITH YOU.

09:06.433 --> 09:07.233
AND FOR 20 MINUTES, AMERICA

09:07.233 --> 09:08.367
WATCHED BECCA, THE BRUNETTE --

09:08.367 --> 09:09.300
>> OH, MY GOD, YOU KNOW HER

09:09.300 --> 09:16.367
NAME.

09:16.367 --> 09:21.900
>> CRY AND CRY AND FEEL

09:21.900 --> 09:22.934
HUMILIATED AND CRY AND SAYING,

09:22.934 --> 09:23.500
GO AWAY, AND HE WOULDN'T GO

09:23.500 --> 09:24.333
AWAY.

09:24.333 --> 09:25.233
>> John: MOVING ON.

09:25.233 --> 09:26.033
OUR MAIN STORY TONIGHT CONCERNS

09:26.033 --> 09:27.033
TECHNOLOGY, THE THING THAT WILL

09:27.033 --> 09:27.900
EVENTUALLY MAKE TELEVISION SO

09:27.900 --> 09:28.800
HI-DEF I WILL NO LONGER BE

09:28.800 --> 09:31.967
ALLOWED TO APPEAR ON IT.

09:31.967 --> 09:32.700
AND I WANT TO APPROACH THIS

09:32.700 --> 09:33.500
CAREFULLY, BECAUSE DISCUSSIONS

09:33.500 --> 09:34.333
OF ANY NEW TECHNOLOGY TEND TO

09:34.333 --> 09:35.300
AGE VERY BADLY, AS THIS NEWS

09:35.300 --> 09:36.367
REPORT FROM LESS THAN FIVE YEARS

09:36.367 --> 09:38.567
AGO SHOWS.

09:38.567 --> 09:40.333
>> THE FIRST USERS OF

09:40.333 --> 09:43.000
GOOGLE GLASSES SURELY WILL NOT

09:43.000 --> 09:44.700
BE THE LAST.

09:44.700 --> 09:46.367
>> I THINK IT'LL END UP CHANGING

09:46.367 --> 09:47.467
OUR LIFESTYLES, YOU KNOW,

09:47.467 --> 09:51.467
CHANGING THE WAY WE INTERACT

09:51.467 --> 09:52.533
WITH EACH OTHER, AND JUST

09:52.533 --> 09:54.667
CHANGING THE GESTURE.

09:54.667 --> 09:56.000
INSTEAD OF THIS, IT WILL BE

09:56.000 --> 10:03.734
THAT.

10:03.734 --> 10:04.400
>> John: YEAH, IT WASN'T THOUGH.

10:04.400 --> 10:05.166
IT WASN'T THAT.

10:05.166 --> 10:05.934
FOR SOME REASON, PEOPLE DIDN'T

10:05.934 --> 10:07.300
MIND DOING THIS WITH THEIR HANDS

10:07.300 --> 10:07.934
IF THE ALTERNATIVE WAS WEARING A

10:07.934 --> 10:08.533
STUPID ROBOT ON THEIR FACE ALL

10:08.533 --> 10:08.834
DAY.

10:08.834 --> 10:10.000
THE POINT IS, IT'S DANGEROUS TO

10:10.000 --> 10:10.567
MAKE PREDICTIONS ABOUT WHERE

10:10.567 --> 10:11.767
TECH IS GOING.

10:11.767 --> 10:13.700
SO THAT SAID, TONIGHT, WE'RE

10:13.700 --> 10:14.800
GOING TO TALK ABOUT

10:14.800 --> 10:15.900
CRYPTOCURRENCIES:

10:15.900 --> 10:16.633
EVERYTHING YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND

10:16.633 --> 10:17.433
ABOUT MONEY COMBINED WITH

10:17.433 --> 10:18.433
EVERYTHING YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND

10:18.433 --> 10:20.100
ABOUT COMPUTERS.

10:20.100 --> 10:21.166
THE MAIN CURRENCY YOU'VE

10:21.166 --> 10:23.100
PROBABLY HEARD ABOUT IS BITCOIN.

10:23.100 --> 10:24.600
IT'S BEEN ALL OVER THE NEWS

10:24.600 --> 10:27.233
BECAUSE LAST YEAR, ITS VALUE

10:27.233 --> 10:28.934
EXPLODED FROM AROUND $1,000 AT

10:28.934 --> 10:31.033
THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR TO

10:31.033 --> 10:32.300
$9,000 BY NOVEMBER TO NEARLY

10:32.300 --> 10:34.000
$20,000 BY DECEMBER.

10:34.000 --> 10:41.166
BITCOIN BECAME SUCH A HOT TOPIC

10:41.166 --> 10:42.033
THAT PAPARAZZI STARTED ASKING

10:42.033 --> 10:42.934
CELEBRITIES ABOUT IT.

10:42.934 --> 10:44.166
WATCH MICHAEL KEATON LEAVING A

10:44.166 --> 10:45.133
RESTAURANT.

10:45.133 --> 10:46.266
>> SEE YOU GUYS, TAKE CARE.

10:46.266 --> 10:46.967
>> HEY, WOULD YOU RECOMMEND

10:46.967 --> 10:47.900
BUYING BITCOIN?

10:47.900 --> 10:48.934
>> YOU KNOW WHAT'S FUNNY?

10:48.934 --> 10:51.000
I WAS JUST TALKING TO MY BUDDY

10:51.000 --> 10:51.600
ABOUT THAT -- WHO KNOWS ABOUT

10:51.600 --> 10:52.600
THAT, I GOT TWO DIFFERENT --

10:52.600 --> 10:53.633
ONE GUY SAID, YEAH, YOU PROBABLY

10:53.633 --> 10:54.633
WANT TO.

10:54.633 --> 10:56.333
THE OTHER FRIEND OF MINE SAID,

10:56.333 --> 10:58.233
EH, NOT LIKE IT'S A BAD THING,

10:58.233 --> 10:59.200
THEY JUST DON'T KNOW WHERE IT'S

10:59.200 --> 11:06.967
GONNA GO.

11:06.967 --> 11:07.800
>> John: I'VE GOT TO SAY,

11:07.800 --> 11:08.734
YOU DO NOT EXPECT CONVERSATIONS

11:08.734 --> 11:12.300
WITH PAPARAZZI TO BE SO NUANCED.

11:12.300 --> 11:13.100
"HEY, CARDI B,

11:13.100 --> 11:14.533
WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON THE

11:14.533 --> 11:15.166
IDEA OF UNIVERSAL BASIC INCOME?"

11:15.166 --> 11:16.033
"WELL, IT COULD GO A LONG WAY TO

11:16.033 --> 11:16.667
REDUCING INEQUALITY, BUT I DON'T

11:16.667 --> 11:17.333
THINK THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WOULD

11:17.333 --> 11:18.000
SUPPORT THE TAX INCREASE

11:18.000 --> 11:19.200
NECESSARY TO FUND IT.

11:19.200 --> 11:19.867
YOU CAN READ ABOUT IT

11:19.867 --> 11:20.533
IN MY BOOK,

11:20.533 --> 11:21.633
'CARDINOMICS: MAKING MONEY MOVES

11:21.633 --> 11:23.367
FOR A NEW AMERICAN CENTURY.'"

11:23.367 --> 11:26.934
AND THIS WAS A DRAMATIC SHIFT,

11:26.934 --> 11:28.633
BECAUSE JUST A FEW YEARS AGO,

11:28.633 --> 11:30.100
YOU'D ONLY HEAR ABOUT BITCOIN

11:30.100 --> 11:31.834
FROM THAT ONE GUY IN THE OFFICE

11:31.834 --> 11:32.433
WHO WOULDN'T SHUT UP ABOUT IT.

11:32.433 --> 11:36.166
LET'S CALL HIM "DAN."

11:36.166 --> 11:38.133
AND THE REASON THAT WE'RE

11:38.133 --> 11:40.066
CALLING HIM "DAN" IS THAT DAN IS

11:40.066 --> 11:41.300
THE EXACT GUY IN OUR OFFICE

11:41.300 --> 11:43.033
WHO'S BEEN ANNOYING EVERYBODY

11:43.033 --> 11:44.800
WITH HIS "YOU GOTTA GET INTO

11:44.800 --> 11:45.467
BITCOIN" SHIT FOR YEARS.

11:45.467 --> 11:46.233
THIS IS WHY WE HATE DAN.

11:46.233 --> 11:46.867
IT'S HONESTLY NOT THE ONLY

11:46.867 --> 11:47.834
REASON, BUT IT'S THE EASIEST ONE

11:47.834 --> 11:51.033
TO BRING UP RIGHT NOW.

11:51.033 --> 11:52.800
THE POINT IS, LATELY, MORE AND

11:52.800 --> 11:58.734
MORE NORMAL PEOPLE, OR

11:58.734 --> 12:00.633
"NON-DANS," HAVE BEEN GETTING

12:00.633 --> 12:02.333
INTO CRYPTOCURRENCIES, PARTLY

12:02.333 --> 12:03.800
BECAUSE THEY MAY'VE SEEN STORIES

12:03.800 --> 12:04.433
LIKE THIS.

12:04.433 --> 12:05.200
>> DYLAN FEIN IS LIVING THE

12:05.200 --> 12:05.934
DREAM.

12:05.934 --> 12:06.800
>> I HAD THAT MITSUBISHI

12:06.800 --> 12:07.133
ECLIPSE.

12:07.133 --> 12:07.834
MY WINDOWS DIDN'T WORK.

12:07.834 --> 12:08.433
MY AC DIDN'T WORK, RIGHT.

12:08.433 --> 12:09.100
I HAD TO OPEN MY DOOR JUST TO

12:09.100 --> 12:09.700
GET FOOD AT THE DRIVE-THROUGH.

12:09.700 --> 12:10.467
>> EVERYTHING CHANGED WHEN HE

12:10.467 --> 12:11.100
MET A FRIEND WHO INTRODUCED HIM

12:11.100 --> 12:13.633
TO BITCOIN.

12:13.633 --> 12:14.567
>> I TURNED $350 INTO $12,000.

12:14.567 --> 12:15.467
>> HE BECAME A MILLIONAIRE AT

12:15.467 --> 12:17.600
24, ALL BY INVESTING IN BITCOIN.

12:17.600 --> 12:19.033
>> I CAN LITERALLY PUT IN A

12:19.033 --> 12:21.066
TRADE, WAIT A FEW HOURS, LET THE

12:21.066 --> 12:23.533
EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATE, AND I'M

12:23.533 --> 12:25.266
ACTUALLY ABLE TO PROFIT FROM THE

12:25.266 --> 12:26.200
WORLD'S LARGEST FINANCIAL MARKET

12:26.200 --> 12:27.867
IN THE WORLD.

12:27.867 --> 12:29.266
>> John: YES, THAT MAN IS

12:29.266 --> 12:30.667
APPARENTLY A MILLIONAIRE NOW,

12:30.667 --> 12:32.233
WHICH IS PRESUMABLY WHY HE IS

12:32.233 --> 12:33.633
BEING INTERVIEWED ON THE MOST

12:33.633 --> 12:34.300
EXPENSIVE OUTDOOR SWAMP LOG IN

12:34.300 --> 12:35.600
SOUTH FLORIDA.

12:35.600 --> 12:37.867
AND DESPITE THE FACT THAT

12:37.867 --> 12:39.133
BITCOIN HAS DROPPED BY NEARLY

12:39.133 --> 12:39.800
HALF SINCE THE START OF THIS

12:39.800 --> 12:41.934
YEAR, THERE IS A STILL A

12:41.934 --> 12:43.433
CRYPTOCURRENCY FERVOR GOING ON,

12:43.433 --> 12:44.633
WITH PEOPLE WATCHING

12:44.633 --> 12:45.900
PEOPLE LIKE THAT GUY GET RICH OR

12:45.900 --> 12:47.333
HEARING ABOUT OTHERS ON

12:47.333 --> 12:48.800
REDDIT OR TWITTER AND FEELING

12:48.800 --> 12:50.500
DRIVEN TO INVEST IN CRYPTO

12:50.500 --> 12:52.533
DUE TO FOMO, OR

12:52.533 --> 12:54.166
"FEAR OF MISSING OUT."

12:54.166 --> 12:59.467
NOW, FOMO IS A TERM THAT MANY OF

12:59.467 --> 13:00.834
YOU PROBABLY ALREADY KNEW ABOUT,

13:00.834 --> 13:02.734
BUT I'M 40 YEARS OLD, BRITISH,

13:02.734 --> 13:03.834
AND OBLIVIOUS, OR "FYOBO."

13:03.834 --> 13:04.834
SO WITH ALL THIS EXCITEMENT AND

13:04.834 --> 13:14.233
CURIOSITY, WE THOUGHT WE'D TRY

13:14.233 --> 13:15.066
AND EXPLAIN A FEW THINGS

13:15.066 --> 13:15.734
TONIGHT.

13:15.734 --> 13:16.467
BITCOIN, BLOCKCHAIN --

13:16.467 --> 13:17.166
THE TECHNOLOGY THAT ALLOWS IT TO

13:17.166 --> 13:17.867
EXIST -- AND CRYPTOCURRENCIES IN

13:17.867 --> 13:18.533
GENERAL.

13:18.533 --> 13:19.266
AND I'M GOING TO BE SIMPLIFYING

13:19.266 --> 13:19.967
THINGS A LOT HERE.

13:19.967 --> 13:20.600
SO LET'S START WITH BITCOIN,

13:20.600 --> 13:21.433
WHICH IS A DIGITAL,

13:21.433 --> 13:22.633
DECENTRALIZED CURRENCY.

13:22.633 --> 13:23.200
THAT BASICALLY MEANS BITCOIN

13:23.200 --> 13:24.033
ONLY EXISTS AS COMPUTER CODE,

13:24.033 --> 13:24.834
AND THERE IS NO BANK OR

13:24.834 --> 13:25.734
GOVERNMENT CREATING OR

13:25.734 --> 13:27.066
CONTROLLING IT.

13:27.066 --> 13:28.300
AND I KNOW THAT'S A LITTLE HARD

13:28.300 --> 13:29.166
TO UNDERSTAND, SO I'LL LET THIS

13:29.166 --> 13:32.100
MAN IN A BITCOIN SUIT GIVE A

13:32.100 --> 13:37.400
SURPRISINGLY DECENT EXPLANATION.

13:37.400 --> 13:38.800
>> I'M A VIRTUAL CURRENCY

13:38.800 --> 13:39.967
WORLDWIDE YOU CAN SEND FOR

13:39.967 --> 13:40.934
LITTLE TO NO FEES.

13:40.934 --> 13:42.066
OPEN-SOURCE, NOT CONTROLLED BY

13:42.066 --> 13:43.633
ANY GOVERNMENT, CORPORATION, OR

13:43.633 --> 13:44.734
INDIVIDUAL.

13:44.734 --> 13:50.500
IT'S FINANCIAL FREEDOM, BRO.

13:50.500 --> 13:51.633
>> John: THANKS, BRO.

13:51.633 --> 13:52.567
THAT IS A NUANCED AND

13:52.567 --> 13:53.233
ACCURATE EXPLANATION OF A

13:53.233 --> 13:54.734
COMPLEX TOPIC DELIVERED WITH THE

13:54.734 --> 13:55.300
HELP OF A MAN IN A STUPID

13:55.300 --> 13:56.467
COSTUME.

13:56.467 --> 13:59.433
AND I WOULD LOVE TO MAKE FUN OF

13:59.433 --> 14:00.467
THAT, EXCEPT IT'S LITERALLY THE

14:00.467 --> 14:01.767
ENTIRE BUSINESS MODEL OF THIS

14:01.767 --> 14:03.066
FUCKING TELEVISION SHOW.

14:03.066 --> 14:04.266
AND YOU MAY BE THINKING, "BUT

14:04.266 --> 14:05.033
WAIT, HOW DO YOU MAKE MONEY FROM

14:05.033 --> 14:09.767
BITCOIN?"

14:09.767 --> 14:12.867
TO WHICH DAN WOULD SAY, "YOU

14:12.867 --> 14:14.533
JUST TRADE IT ON EXCHANGES LIKE

14:14.533 --> 14:15.233
ANY OTHER CURRENCY."

14:15.233 --> 14:15.967
AND IF YOU THEN ASK, "WELL, HOW

14:15.967 --> 14:16.734
DOES IT HAVE VALUE?"

14:16.734 --> 14:17.500
DAN WOULD REPLY, "HOW DOES ANY

14:17.500 --> 14:18.367
MONEY HAVE VALUE, MAN?"

14:18.367 --> 14:20.100
AND THEN HE'D SAY,

14:20.100 --> 14:22.700
"CALL ME THE BRAIN-FELLATER,

14:22.700 --> 14:23.567
'CAUSE I JUST BLEW YOUR FUCKING

14:23.567 --> 14:24.600
MIND."

14:24.600 --> 14:25.600
TO WHICH YOU WOULD SAY,

14:25.600 --> 14:30.500
"FORGET I ASKED, DAN.

14:30.500 --> 14:31.166
YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY GROSS.

14:31.166 --> 14:34.533
I HATE YOU."

14:34.533 --> 14:36.100
BUT THE PROBLEM IS, DAN IS KIND

14:36.100 --> 14:36.900
OF RIGHT.

14:36.900 --> 14:37.600
LIKE MOST CURRENCIES, THE

14:37.600 --> 14:38.400
FUNDAMENTAL REASON THAT BITCOIN

14:38.400 --> 14:39.066
HAS VALUE IS BECAUSE PEOPLE

14:39.066 --> 14:40.066
AGREE THAT IT HAS VALUE.

14:40.066 --> 14:41.066
IN FACT, AT THE MOMENT, IT'S

14:41.066 --> 14:42.467
REALLY BEING TREATED MORE LIKE A

14:42.467 --> 14:43.066
SPECULATIVE INVESTMENT THAN A

14:43.066 --> 14:43.734
CURRENCY.

14:43.734 --> 14:46.567
THINK OF IT LIKE BEANIE BABIES.

14:46.567 --> 14:48.133
WHY IS THIS BEANIE BABY

14:48.133 --> 14:50.200
CURRENTLY BEING OFFERED FOR SALE

14:50.200 --> 14:52.367
ON ETSY AT A PRICE OF $15,000?

14:52.367 --> 14:55.066
WELL, BECAUSE ITS OWNER THINKS

14:55.066 --> 14:55.867
THAT SOMEONE WILL PAY THAT FOR

14:55.867 --> 14:56.700
IT.

14:56.700 --> 15:02.934
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

15:02.934 --> 15:03.567
THAT OWNER WAS ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

15:03.567 --> 15:04.266
I'M KIDDING.

15:04.266 --> 15:05.033
I'M KIDDING.

15:05.033 --> 15:05.734
I JUST BOUGHT THIS AT A YARD

15:05.734 --> 15:08.600
SALE FOR $10,000.

15:08.600 --> 15:09.400
I'M NOT A COMPLETE IDIOT.

15:09.400 --> 15:10.233
AND WHILE BITCOIN IS VERY

15:10.233 --> 15:11.367
INTERESTING AS A CONCEPT, THERE

15:11.367 --> 15:12.333
ARE STILL SOME COMPLICATED

15:12.333 --> 15:13.266
TECHNICAL ISSUES TO WORK OUT

15:13.266 --> 15:14.834
BEFORE IT CAN BECOME A USABLE

15:14.834 --> 15:16.333
EVERYDAY CURRENCY.

15:16.333 --> 15:17.967
JUST LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED IN

15:17.967 --> 15:20.767
JANUARY.

15:20.767 --> 15:22.066
>> HUNDREDS ARE IN MIAMI THIS

15:22.066 --> 15:23.900
WEEK FOR A BITCOIN CONFERENCE,

15:23.900 --> 15:25.033
BUT IT HAD TO STOP TAKING

15:25.033 --> 15:27.867
BITCOIN AS A PAYMENT FOR TICKETS

15:27.867 --> 15:29.066
LAST WEEK, SUGGESTING THERE ARE

15:29.066 --> 15:30.500
STILL KINKS TO WORK OUT WITH THE

15:30.500 --> 15:31.967
CURRENCY.

15:31.967 --> 15:33.133
>> John: YES, A BITCOIN

15:33.133 --> 15:36.700
CONFERENCE STOPPED TAKING

15:36.700 --> 15:40.533
BITCOIN, WHICH IS A RED FLAG,

15:40.533 --> 15:42.367
SINCE THAT'S THE ONE PLACE YOU'D

15:42.367 --> 15:43.166
THINK IT'D BE ACCEPTED.

15:43.166 --> 15:44.333
IT'S LIKE WHEN I TRIED TO PAY

15:44.333 --> 15:45.233
FOR ACCESS TO THE

15:45.233 --> 15:46.100
REPUBLICAN NATIONAL CONVENTION

15:46.100 --> 15:46.900
USING RONALD REAGAN'S DUSTY

15:46.900 --> 15:48.033
SKELETON BONES.

15:48.033 --> 15:48.767
EVERYONE THERE AGREED THEY HAD

15:48.767 --> 15:50.000
VALUE; THERE JUST WASN'T AN

15:50.000 --> 15:54.633
ADEQUATE NETWORK IN PLACE FOR

15:54.633 --> 15:56.667
THE COMPLETION OF OUR

15:56.667 --> 15:57.767
TRANSACTION.

15:57.767 --> 15:59.300
BUT WHETHER BITCOIN CATCHES ON

15:59.300 --> 15:59.934
OR NOT, MANY PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT

15:59.934 --> 16:00.700
THE REALLY EXCITING THING ABOUT

16:00.700 --> 16:01.667
IT IS THE POTENTIAL OF THE

16:01.667 --> 16:06.400
INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGY IT'S BUILT

16:06.400 --> 16:08.734
ON, AND THAT'S SOMETHING CALLED

16:08.734 --> 16:09.233
"BLOCKCHAIN."

16:09.233 --> 16:10.266
NOW, NORMALLY IF I WANTED TO

16:10.266 --> 16:10.900
SEND MONEY TO SOMEONE ACROSS THE

16:10.900 --> 16:11.867
WORLD, A BANK WOULD NEED TO

16:11.867 --> 16:12.967
VERIFY THAT, AND IT COULD TAKE

16:12.967 --> 16:14.133
DAYS.

16:14.133 --> 16:15.066
BUT WITH BITCOIN, IT'S VASTLY

16:15.066 --> 16:15.934
FASTER, BECAUSE NO BANK IS

16:15.934 --> 16:16.867
INVOLVED.

16:16.867 --> 16:17.867
AND THAT'S BECAUSE BLOCKCHAIN

16:17.867 --> 16:18.900
TECHNOLOGY ALLOWS A RECORD, OR

16:18.900 --> 16:19.934
LEDGER, OF EVERY BITCOIN

16:19.934 --> 16:20.934
TRANSACTION EVER MADE TO BE

16:20.934 --> 16:22.567
STORED, NOT IN ONE PLACE, BUT

16:22.567 --> 16:23.633
ACROSS VAST NUMBERS OF

16:23.633 --> 16:30.166
COMPUTERS.

16:30.166 --> 16:31.000
THAT'S PART OF WHAT PEOPLE MEAN

16:31.000 --> 16:32.133
WHEN THEY SAY BITCOIN IS

16:32.133 --> 16:33.567
"DECENTRALIZED," AND

16:33.567 --> 16:34.367
DECENTRALIZATION HAS A LOT OF

16:34.367 --> 16:35.700
THEORETICAL ADVANTAGES, FROM

16:35.700 --> 16:38.967
SPEED TO SECURITY.

16:38.967 --> 16:40.000
>> THE KEY POINT HERE IS THAT

16:40.000 --> 16:41.166
THIS IS A DISTRIBUTED LEDGER.

16:41.166 --> 16:42.500
THERE IS NO CENTRAL SURVEY.

16:42.500 --> 16:43.533
ALL THE OTHER LEDGERS THAT WE

16:43.533 --> 16:44.667
HAVE, ALL BANKING LEDGERS, ALL

16:44.667 --> 16:46.100
COMPANY LEDGERS, THEY ALL SIT

16:46.100 --> 16:48.500
AND RESIDE INSIDE THAT COMPANY,

16:48.500 --> 16:49.767
WHICH MEANS THEY HAVE ONE POINT

16:49.767 --> 16:52.066
OF ATTACK, THEY CAN BE HACKED.

16:52.066 --> 16:53.100
J.P. MORGAN WAS HACKED BY, YOU

16:53.100 --> 16:54.400
KNOW, CYBER THIEVES NOT SO LONG

16:54.400 --> 16:55.834
AGO.

16:55.834 --> 16:56.834
HOME DEPOT, TARGET, WE'VE HAD

16:56.834 --> 16:58.100
ALL THESE COMPANIES GET HACKED

16:58.100 --> 16:59.367
PRECISELY BECAUSE THERE'S ONE

16:59.367 --> 17:00.333
CENTRAL REPOSITORY OF

17:00.333 --> 17:02.734
INFORMATION.

17:02.734 --> 17:04.133
THE BITCOIN LEDGER RESIDES ON,

17:04.133 --> 17:04.767
YOU KNOW, THOUSANDS OF

17:04.767 --> 17:06.400
COMPUTERS.

17:06.400 --> 17:11.367
YOU CAN'T HACK THAT.

17:11.367 --> 17:13.467
>> John: WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT

17:13.467 --> 17:16.467
IT, THAT SOUNDS GREAT.

17:16.467 --> 17:17.300
AND BECAUSE OF THE COMPLICATED

17:17.300 --> 17:18.100
PROCESS THE NETWORK USES TO

17:18.100 --> 17:19.033
VERIFY RECORDS, IT'S VERY

17:19.033 --> 17:19.834
SECURE.

17:19.834 --> 17:20.700
NOW, RELAX.

17:20.700 --> 17:21.834
I'M NOT GOING TO GET INTO WHAT

17:21.834 --> 17:22.533
THAT PROCESS IS OR HOW IT WORKS,

17:22.533 --> 17:23.433
BUT I WILL SHARE A REALLY

17:23.433 --> 17:26.100
HELPFUL, REALLY DUMB METAPHOR

17:26.100 --> 17:27.033
FOR WHY IT IS SAFE.

17:27.033 --> 17:28.767
>> THE WAY I LIKE TO THINK OF IT

17:28.767 --> 17:29.900
IS THAT A BLOCKCHAIN IS A HIGHLY

17:29.900 --> 17:32.100
PROCESSED THING, SORT OF LIKE A

17:32.100 --> 17:33.333
CHICKEN McNUGGET, AND IF YOU

17:33.333 --> 17:34.900
WANTED TO HACK IT, IT'D BE LIKE

17:34.900 --> 17:36.100
TURNING A CHICKEN McNUGGET

17:36.100 --> 17:38.066
BACK INTO A CHICKEN.

17:38.066 --> 17:39.500
NOW SOMEDAY, SOMEONE WILL BE

17:39.500 --> 17:40.667
ABLE TO DO THAT, BUT FOR NOW

17:40.667 --> 17:45.200
IT'S GOING TO BE TOUGH.

17:45.200 --> 17:47.266
>> John: HOLD ON.

17:47.266 --> 17:52.166
THAT IS A HORRIBLE THOUGHT, SO

17:52.166 --> 17:55.266
WHY IS THAT REPORTER SO HAPPY

17:55.266 --> 17:57.567
ABOUT THE IDEA?

17:57.567 --> 17:58.567
IF ANYONE EVER FIGURES OUT HOW

17:58.567 --> 17:59.533
TO TURN A CHICKEN McNUGGET

17:59.533 --> 18:00.367
BACK INTO A CHICKEN, THAT

18:00.367 --> 18:01.333
CHICKEN IS GOING TO BE

18:01.333 --> 18:02.367
FUCKED UP.

18:02.367 --> 18:03.233
HE'S GOING TO SPEND THE REST OF

18:03.233 --> 18:04.500
HIS LIFE SUFFERING FROM PTSD AND

18:04.500 --> 18:05.100
WRITING HAUNTING POETRY ABOUT

18:05.100 --> 18:06.567
THE EXPERIENCE.

18:06.567 --> 18:08.467
"THE THINGS I SAW,

18:08.467 --> 18:09.900
BOK BOK, B'CAW.

18:09.900 --> 18:11.100
MY BODY IS WHOLE,

18:11.100 --> 18:18.200
BUT WHAT OF MY SOUL?"

18:18.200 --> 18:19.066
SO VERY BASICALLY, THAT IS THE

18:19.066 --> 18:19.800
BLOCKCHAIN: A DATABASE THAT'S

18:19.800 --> 18:20.900
NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO HACK OR

18:20.900 --> 18:21.800
TAMPER WITH AND COULD POSSIBLY

18:21.800 --> 18:22.767
IMPROVE SECURITY, EFFICIENCY,

18:22.767 --> 18:25.734
AND TRUST.

18:25.734 --> 18:26.567
THAT IS WHY BIG COMPANIES LIKE

18:26.567 --> 18:27.600
WALMART, IBM, AND J.P. MORGAN

18:27.600 --> 18:28.567
ARE EXPERIMENTING WITH

18:28.567 --> 18:29.734
BLOCKCHAIN AS A WAY TO

18:29.734 --> 18:30.800
POTENTIALLY SHARE AND SECURE

18:30.800 --> 18:31.934
DATA AND TRANSACTIONS IN A

18:31.934 --> 18:40.367
RELIABLE, EASY-TO-ACCESS WAY.

18:40.367 --> 18:41.033
BUT IT IS STILL VERY EARLY.

18:41.033 --> 18:41.800
NO ONE YET KNOWS WHAT BLOCKCHAIN

18:41.800 --> 18:42.433
IS REALLY CAPABLE OF.

18:42.433 --> 18:43.300
HONESTLY, DON'T WORRY IF YOU

18:43.300 --> 18:44.533
STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND IT.

18:44.533 --> 18:46.300
MOST PEOPLE DON'T.

18:46.300 --> 18:47.166
DAN THINKS HE DOES, AND HE'LL

18:47.166 --> 18:48.066
THROW AROUND TERMS LIKE

18:48.066 --> 18:49.867
"SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT" AND IT

18:49.867 --> 18:51.800
MAKES ME WANT TO PUNCH HIM IN

18:51.800 --> 18:53.333
HIS FUCKING FACE.

18:53.333 --> 18:57.900
STOP LEAVING PRINTOUTS OF

18:57.900 --> 18:58.700
REDDIT THREADS ON MY DESK, DAN!

18:58.700 --> 18:59.633
YOU KNOW I'M JUST THROWING THEM

18:59.633 --> 19:05.500
AWAY!

19:05.500 --> 19:06.066
I HATE YOU!

19:06.066 --> 19:06.900
THE PROBLEM IS, THERE IS NOW

19:06.900 --> 19:07.834
ENOUGH EXCITEMENT AROUND THE

19:07.834 --> 19:08.600
VERY WORD "BLOCKCHAIN" THAT IT'S

19:08.600 --> 19:09.834
BECOME A MAGNET FOR INVESTMENT.

19:09.834 --> 19:10.600
REUTERS FOUND THAT EXISTING

19:10.600 --> 19:16.500
COMPANIES THAT MERELY ADDED

19:16.500 --> 19:18.300
THE WORD "BLOCKCHAIN" TO THEIR

19:18.300 --> 19:20.066
NAME SAW THEIR STOCK PRICE

19:20.066 --> 19:23.133
INCREASE BY MORE THAN THREEFOLD,

19:23.133 --> 19:23.867
AND ONE OF THEM WAS PARTICULARLY

19:23.867 --> 19:24.800
DUMB.

19:24.800 --> 19:25.700
>> LONG ISLAND ICED TEA RENAMED

19:25.700 --> 19:26.266
THEMSELVES LONG BLOCKCHAIN.

19:26.266 --> 19:27.934
AND GUESS WHAT HAPPENED?

19:27.934 --> 19:29.233
YEAH, THEIR STOCK TRIPLED.

19:29.233 --> 19:30.567
>> WOW.

19:30.567 --> 19:31.834
>> I'M GOING TO SAY IT.

19:31.834 --> 19:36.033
TO PEOPLE WHO WATCH MARKETS,

19:36.033 --> 19:36.834
THIS SEEMS SO STUPID, IT'S NOT

19:36.834 --> 19:37.567
EVEN WORTH REPORTING.

19:37.567 --> 19:38.300
>> John: I DON'T CARE HOW STUPID

19:38.300 --> 19:39.000
IT IS, IT WORKS.

19:39.000 --> 19:39.800
THAT'S WHY, FROM NOW ON, THIS

19:39.800 --> 19:40.700
SHOW WILL BE CALLED

19:40.700 --> 19:42.800
"LAST BIT TONIGHT WITH

19:42.800 --> 19:48.500
BLOCK CHAINIVER."

19:48.500 --> 19:49.900
TRIPLE THE RATINGS, TRIPLE!

19:49.900 --> 19:51.367
TAKE IT TO THE BANK!

19:51.367 --> 19:52.367
SO NOW, YOU KNOW BASICALLY WHAT

19:52.367 --> 19:53.533
BITCOIN IS:

19:53.533 --> 19:55.233
IT'S THE FUTURE, BRO.

19:55.233 --> 19:56.200
AND WHY PEOPLE ARE EXCITED ABOUT

19:56.200 --> 19:57.934
BLOCKCHAIN:

19:57.934 --> 20:01.166
IT WON'T LET PEOPLE CHICKEN UP

20:01.166 --> 20:02.700
YOUR NUGGS.

20:02.700 --> 20:03.767
BUT YOU MIGHT STILL BE

20:03.767 --> 20:04.767
WONDERING, WHAT ABOUT ALL THE

20:04.767 --> 20:05.767
OTHER CRYPTOCURRENCIES I'VE

20:05.767 --> 20:07.800
HEARD ABOUT?

20:07.800 --> 20:09.266
OKAY, WELL, THE KEY SOFTWARE TO

20:09.266 --> 20:12.233
CREATE A COIN IS OPEN-SOURCE,

20:12.233 --> 20:18.233
MEANING THAT JUST ABOUT ANYONE

20:18.233 --> 20:23.867
CAN CREATE ONE, SO THEY HAVE

20:23.867 --> 20:24.600
DONE THAT.

20:24.600 --> 20:25.333
THERE ARE NOW OVER 1,500

20:25.333 --> 20:26.000
CRYPTOCURRENCIES YOU CAN BUY,

20:26.000 --> 20:26.734
WITH NAMES LIKE TITCOIN,

20:26.734 --> 20:27.500
TRUMPCOIN, JESUSCOIN,

20:27.500 --> 20:28.333
INSANECOIN, ELECTRONEUM, WAX,

20:28.333 --> 20:29.200
PARTICL, DEEP ONION, SNOVIO,

20:29.200 --> 20:33.166
PLUTON, NuBITS, AND CLAMS.

20:33.166 --> 20:34.934
A LIST SO INSANE THAT YOU CAN'T

20:34.934 --> 20:36.700
TELL WHICH ONES ARE REAL AND

20:36.700 --> 20:38.467
WHICH ONES ARE MADE UP.

20:38.467 --> 20:39.533
BECAUSE THEY'RE ALL REAL, I

20:39.533 --> 20:40.767
DIDN'T MAKE ANY UP.

20:40.767 --> 20:42.033
I TRIED TO COME UP WITH A DUMBER

20:42.033 --> 20:43.967
NAME THAN "DEEP ONION" AND IT

20:43.967 --> 20:45.300
JUST CAN'T BE DONE.

20:45.300 --> 20:46.200
AND, LOOK, NOT ALL OF THESE

20:46.200 --> 20:47.400
COINS ARE LIKE BITCOIN, JUST

20:47.400 --> 20:48.767
HOPING TO BE THE NEXT CURRENCY.

20:48.767 --> 20:50.266
OFTENTIMES STARTUP COMPANIES

20:50.266 --> 20:52.433
WILL SELL A COIN TO TRY AND

20:52.433 --> 20:55.567
RAISE MONEY AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO

20:55.567 --> 20:56.700
ISSUING STOCK, AND SOMETIMES

20:56.700 --> 21:00.533
THOSE COINS ARE MEANT AS TOKENS

21:00.533 --> 21:01.533
TO BE USED FOR SERVICES THAT THE

21:01.533 --> 21:03.066
STARTUP MIGHT EVENTUALLY

21:03.066 --> 21:03.667
PROVIDE, KIND OF LIKE THE

21:03.667 --> 21:04.767
TOKENS AT CHUCK E. CHEESE, ONLY

21:04.767 --> 21:06.100
VIRTUAL AND NOT REDEEMABLE AT A

21:06.100 --> 21:10.433
RAT-BASED FOOD EMPORIUM.

21:10.433 --> 21:11.533
IT HAS BECOME INCREDIBLY EASY TO

21:11.533 --> 21:12.567
ISSUE COINS, SO COMPANIES ARE

21:12.567 --> 21:15.033
DOING IT A LOT.

21:15.033 --> 21:17.467
INITIAL COIN OFFERINGS, OR

21:17.467 --> 21:20.333
ICOs, RAISED OVER $6 BILLION

21:20.333 --> 21:23.800
IN 2017, WITH ONE COMPANY

21:23.800 --> 21:24.834
RAISING $35 MILLION IN UNDER

21:24.834 --> 21:25.967
30 SECONDS.

21:25.967 --> 21:27.500
NORMALLY WHEN SOMEONE MAKES THAT

21:27.500 --> 21:28.967
MUCH MONEY THAT FAST, THEY DID

21:28.967 --> 21:30.900
IT BY WALKING UP TO

21:30.900 --> 21:34.100
BILL O'REILLY, SITTING IN

21:34.100 --> 21:39.600
SILENCE FOR 26 SECONDS, AND THEN

21:39.600 --> 21:42.967
SAYING, "I RECORDED OUR PHONE

21:42.967 --> 21:45.233
CALLS."

21:45.233 --> 21:46.700
BUT THE VAST MAJORITY OF PEOPLE

21:46.700 --> 21:47.333
BUYING THESE COINS AREN'T PAYING

21:47.333 --> 21:48.233
MUCH ATTENTION TO THE DETAILS OF

21:48.233 --> 21:48.934
THE STARTUPS THEY'RE ATTACHED

21:48.934 --> 21:49.734
TO.

21:49.734 --> 21:51.400
THEY'RE JUST RESPONDING TO THE

21:51.400 --> 21:52.200
HUGE FERVOR.

21:52.200 --> 21:53.133
AND THERE'S A LOT OF IT --

21:53.133 --> 21:53.800
THERE'S AN ENTIRE ONLINE

21:53.800 --> 21:55.600
SUBCULTURE OF

21:55.600 --> 21:56.667
YOUTUBE PERSONALITIES AND

21:56.667 --> 21:57.567
SUBREDDITS THAT HAVE A CULTLIKE

21:57.567 --> 21:58.333
DEVOTION TO BUYING THESE COINS.

21:58.333 --> 21:59.233
AND IF YOU STUMBLE INTO ONE,

21:59.233 --> 21:59.934
YOU'LL FIND THEY HAVE A WHOLE

21:59.934 --> 22:02.667
SHORTHAND.

22:02.667 --> 22:04.333
ONE KEY TERM IS "HODL," BASED ON

22:04.333 --> 22:05.934
A MISSPELLING OF "HOLD."

22:05.934 --> 22:07.266
THIS IS A FOUNDATIONAL

22:07.266 --> 22:08.066
PRINCIPLE: DON'T SELL WHEN

22:08.066 --> 22:09.667
PRICES DROP.

22:09.667 --> 22:11.867
INSTEAD, HODL IN THE FACE OF

22:11.867 --> 22:13.567
"FUD": "FEAR, UNCERTAINTY, AND

22:13.567 --> 22:14.800
DOUBT."

22:14.800 --> 22:16.200
OTHERWISE, YOU MIGHT MISS OUT

22:16.200 --> 22:18.100
WHEN THE COIN "MOONS," OR

22:18.100 --> 22:21.667
ROCKETS UP IN VALUE, MEANING

22:21.667 --> 22:23.967
YOU'LL GET "REKT," OR LOSE

22:23.967 --> 22:30.367
MONEY, AND NEVER BE ABLE TO

22:30.367 --> 22:32.467
GOAL, A "LAMBO," WHICH IS SHORT

22:32.467 --> 22:34.100
FOR LAMBORGHINI, BECAUSE OF

22:34.100 --> 22:35.066
COURSE IT IS.

22:35.066 --> 22:35.834
AND IF YOU'RE THINKING THESE

22:35.834 --> 22:36.533
TERMS BELONG IN A RAP VIDEO,

22:36.533 --> 22:37.300

22:56.000 --> 22:56.900
HARD NOT TO WATCH THAT AND DEEP

23:04.467 --> 23:05.800
THE POINT IS, MANY PEOPLE ARE

23:05.800 --> 23:06.533
BUYING COINS FOR NO REASON OTHER

23:06.533 --> 23:07.433
THAN THAT OTHER PEOPLE ARE

23:07.433 --> 23:08.600
BUYING THEM.

23:08.600 --> 23:13.200
AND THIS MANIA HAS GOTTEN TO THE

23:13.200 --> 23:14.033
POINT WHERE EVEN A COIN STARTED

23:14.033 --> 23:16.333
AS A COMPLETE JOKE, LIKE

23:16.333 --> 23:17.133
DOGECOIN, CAN ROCKET UP IN

23:17.133 --> 23:17.967
VALUE.

23:17.967 --> 23:18.667
>> IT'S NAMED AFTER AN INTERNET

23:18.667 --> 23:19.767
MEME THAT WAS POPULAR AT THE

23:19.767 --> 23:20.467
TIME, A PHOTO OF A SHIBA INU

23:20.467 --> 23:21.433
WITH COLORFUL COMMENTS IN BROKEN

23:21.433 --> 23:22.066
ENGLISH AROUND IT, AS YOU CAN

23:22.066 --> 23:23.533
SEE.

23:23.533 --> 23:25.166
NOW DOGECOIN'S TOTAL MARKET

23:25.166 --> 23:27.100
VALUE HAS ALMOST DOUBLED SINCE

23:27.100 --> 23:29.533
THE START OF THIS YEAR TO OVER

23:29.533 --> 23:32.200
$2 BILLION.

23:32.200 --> 23:33.300
THERE APPEAR TO BE NO OBVIOUS

23:33.300 --> 23:39.567
REASONS FOR THIS.

23:39.567 --> 23:40.467
>> John: YEAH, THAT'S BECAUSE

23:40.467 --> 23:42.400
THERE WERE NO OBVIOUS REASONS.

23:42.400 --> 23:43.467
THE WHOLE POINT OF THE COIN WAS

23:43.467 --> 23:44.066
TO MAKE FUN OF HOW PEOPLE WILL

23:44.066 --> 23:44.667
BUY ANYTHING.

23:44.667 --> 23:45.467
AND THEN THEY DID EXACTLY THAT.

23:45.467 --> 23:46.467
THAT'S NO LESS RIDICULOUS THAN

23:46.467 --> 23:47.333
IF YOU STARTED A JOKE BAND AFTER

23:47.333 --> 23:48.166
THE BEATLES CALLED

23:48.166 --> 23:49.166
THE WOOFLES THAT WAS ALL

23:49.166 --> 23:50.033
ST. BERNARD'S AND THEY WENT ON

23:50.033 --> 23:50.867
TO HAVE 40 NUMBER ONE HITS AND

23:50.867 --> 23:56.433
WERE KNIGHTED BY THE QUEEN.

23:56.433 --> 23:58.000
THIS IS CLEARLY RIDICULOUS, BUT

23:58.000 --> 23:58.734
FOR INVESTORS, IT'S POTENTIALLY

23:58.734 --> 23:59.633
DANGEROUS, BECAUSE RIGHT NOW,

23:59.633 --> 24:00.567
THIS MARKET IS ESSENTIALLY THE

24:00.567 --> 24:01.367
WILD WEST AND RIPE FOR

24:01.367 --> 24:02.300
EXPLOITATION.

24:02.300 --> 24:03.567
FOR INSTANCE, IT CAN BE EASY TO

24:03.567 --> 24:04.433
MANIPULATE THE VALUE OF CERTAIN

24:04.433 --> 24:05.667
COINS THROUGH THINGS LIKE

24:05.667 --> 24:07.467
PUMP-AND-DUMP SCHEMES.

24:07.467 --> 24:08.400
REGULATORS CRACK DOWN ON THOSE

24:08.400 --> 24:09.834
WHEN THEY HAPPEN WITH STOCKS,

24:09.834 --> 24:14.533
BUT THEY'VE BEEN SLOWER TO ACT

24:14.533 --> 24:15.367
IN THE CRYPTO MARKET, AND THAT

24:15.367 --> 24:16.166
MAY EXPLAIN WHY GROUPS

24:16.166 --> 24:17.033
HAVE FELT COMFORTABLE POSTING

24:17.033 --> 24:18.133
VIDEOS LIKE THIS.

24:18.133 --> 24:19.367
>> WELCOME TO CRYPTOCALLZ, A

24:19.367 --> 24:20.300
LEADING CRYPTOCURRENCY PUMP

24:20.300 --> 24:21.166
GROUP WHERE WE SKYROCKET THE

24:21.166 --> 24:22.500
VALUE OF COINS FOR SIX HOURS AT

24:22.500 --> 24:23.834
A TIME.

24:23.834 --> 24:24.967
FOR INFORMATION ABOUT OUR WEEKLY

24:24.967 --> 24:26.166
PUMPS, INCLUDING THE NAME OF THE

24:26.166 --> 24:27.800
COIN WE ARE PUMPING, FOLLOW OUR

24:27.800 --> 24:29.333
TELEGRAM CHANNEL.

24:29.333 --> 24:31.934
ONCE RELEASED, BE SURE TO BUY

24:31.934 --> 24:33.333
THE COIN AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE.

24:33.333 --> 24:34.567
WHEN EVERYONE IN THE GROUP HAS

24:34.567 --> 24:36.000
PURCHASED THE COIN, WE WILL

24:36.000 --> 24:37.066
BEGIN ADVERTISING IT TO OTHER

24:37.066 --> 24:38.233
INVESTORS ON SOCIAL MEDIA.

24:38.233 --> 24:39.900
DURING THE FINAL HOUR, OUTSIDE

24:39.900 --> 24:41.800
INVESTORS WILL FILL OUR ORDERS

24:41.800 --> 24:43.100
AS THEY FOMO INTO THE COIN THAT

24:43.100 --> 24:44.266
WE HAVE INCREASED IN VALUE 1000%

24:44.266 --> 24:46.433
TO 2000%.

24:46.433 --> 24:49.500
BY THE TIME THAT THE SIX HOURS

24:49.500 --> 24:50.600
IS UP, EVERYONE IN OUR GROUP

24:50.600 --> 24:51.567
WILL HAVE SOLD FOR PROFIT.

24:51.567 --> 24:52.400
CRYPTOCALLZ:

24:52.400 --> 24:56.600
TOGETHER, WE PROFIT.

24:56.600 --> 24:58.300
>> John: HOLY SHIT.

24:58.300 --> 24:59.967
IT'S KIND OF DESTABILIZING TO

24:59.967 --> 25:02.400
SEE A BRAZEN ADVERTISEMENT FOR

25:02.400 --> 25:03.133
SOMETHING YOU COULD HAVE SWORN

25:03.133 --> 25:03.934
WAS ILLEGAL.

25:03.934 --> 25:04.800
IT'S LIKE WATCHING A COMMERCIAL

25:04.800 --> 25:05.700
AND HEARING, "DO YOU NOT HAVE A

25:05.700 --> 25:06.600
CHILD?

25:06.600 --> 25:07.834
DO YOU WANT SOMEBODY ELSE'S?

25:07.834 --> 25:08.734
THEN KIDNAPPERS' KORNER IS THE

25:08.734 --> 25:09.767
GROUP FOR YOU!

25:09.767 --> 25:10.934
HERE AT KIDNAPPERS' KORNER, WE

25:10.934 --> 25:12.400
TAKE CHILDREN THAT ARE NOT OURS

25:12.400 --> 25:15.767
AND BRING THEM HOME WITH US!

25:15.767 --> 25:16.533
IT'S EASY-PEASY

25:16.533 --> 25:21.433
TODDLER-SEIZE-Y!"

25:21.433 --> 25:23.200
AND, LOOK, PUMP-AND-DUMPS ARE

25:23.200 --> 25:24.233
JUST THE BEGINNING.

25:24.233 --> 25:24.867
THERE ARE DODGY COMPANIES

25:24.867 --> 25:25.800
EVERYWHERE, SOME OF WHICH LOOK

25:25.800 --> 25:26.800
LIKE OLD-SCHOOL FRAUDS WITH SOME

25:26.800 --> 25:27.867
CRYPTO SAUCE POURED ON TOP.

25:27.867 --> 25:28.367
TAKE BITCONNECT.

25:28.367 --> 25:29.100
AT ONE POINT, IT WAS WORTH

25:29.100 --> 25:31.533
AROUND $3 BILLION.

25:31.533 --> 25:33.667
NOW, BITCONNECT TOLD INVESTORS

25:33.667 --> 25:35.734
THAT, IF THEY HANDED OVER MONEY,

25:35.734 --> 25:37.500
THEY COULD GET RETURNS AS HIGH

25:37.500 --> 25:38.100
AS 40% A MONTH.

25:38.100 --> 25:39.300
AND A RATE OF RETURN THAT HIGH

25:39.300 --> 25:40.066
MIGHT BE SUSPICIOUS TO YOU, BUT

25:40.066 --> 25:44.934
REMEMBER, THE MARKET WAS

25:44.934 --> 25:46.600
SOARING, AND BITCONNECT HAD

25:46.600 --> 25:48.367
EXCITED INVESTORS, LIKE THIS GUY

25:48.367 --> 25:49.033
WHO SPOKE AT A BITCONNECT

25:49.033 --> 25:50.033
CONFERENCE.

25:50.033 --> 25:52.967
>> HEY, HEY, HEY!

25:52.967 --> 25:55.200
WASSA

25:55.200 --> 25:56.166
BITCONNECT!

25:56.166 --> 25:57.767
LET ME TELL YOU THAT WE ARE

25:57.767 --> 25:59.100
REALLY CHANGING THE WORLD AS WE

25:59.100 --> 26:00.867
KNOW IT.

26:00.867 --> 26:02.133
THE WORLD IS NOT ANYMORE THE WAY

26:02.133 --> 26:07.033
IT USED TO BE.

26:07.033 --> 26:08.533
MM-MM, NO-NO-NO!

26:08.533 --> 26:14.166
BITCONNECT!

26:14.166 --> 26:15.567
WHOO!

26:15.567 --> 26:25.367
BITCONNECT!

26:25.367 --> 26:26.767
I LOVE...

26:26.767 --> 26:30.166
BITCONNECT!

26:30.166 --> 26:32.300
>> John: YES.

26:32.300 --> 26:33.200
THE LAST TIME I SAW

26:33.200 --> 26:34.333
SOMEONE THAT IRRATIONALLY

26:34.333 --> 26:35.834
EXUBERANT ABOUT A MAJOR

26:35.834 --> 26:36.867
COMMITMENT, HE WAS ROUGHLY

26:36.867 --> 26:38.133
SIX YEARS AWAY FROM DIVORCING

26:38.133 --> 26:38.533
KATIE HOLMES.

26:38.533 --> 26:40.600
AND I DON'T BLAME HIM FOR

26:40.600 --> 26:41.700
ANYTHING THERE.

26:41.700 --> 26:42.734
HE'S GOT A GOOD HEAD ON HIS

26:42.734 --> 26:43.767
SHOULDERS.

26:43.767 --> 26:47.333
YOU STAY CLEAR, TOMMY.

26:47.333 --> 26:48.467
STAY CLEAR, MY BOY.

26:48.467 --> 26:49.567
THAT MAN'S PASSION HAS BECOME

26:49.567 --> 26:50.667
FAMOUS IN THE CRYPTO WORLD, AS

26:50.667 --> 26:51.300
WELL AS HIS CONVICTION THAT THE

26:51.300 --> 26:52.400
BUSINESS HE HAD BECOME INVOLVED

26:52.400 --> 26:54.233
IN WAS 100% LEGIT.

26:54.233 --> 26:55.734
>> I AM SAYING TO SO MANY PEOPLE

26:55.734 --> 26:57.734
WHO SAY THAT THIS WAS GOING TO

26:57.734 --> 26:59.533
BE A CON ARTIST GAME, THAT THIS

26:59.533 --> 27:02.834
WAS GOING TO BE A SCAMMER GAME,

27:02.834 --> 27:11.433
"HEY, YOU'RE GONNA LOSE ALL YOUR

27:11.433 --> 27:12.367
MONEY" --

27:12.367 --> 27:13.400
MY WIFE STILL DOESN'T

27:13.400 --> 27:14.066
BELIEVE IN ME!

27:14.066 --> 27:15.266
I TELL HER, "WELL, HONEY, LOOK,

27:15.266 --> 27:17.333
THIS IS REAL."

27:17.333 --> 27:18.066
"NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, THAT'S A

27:18.066 --> 27:18.800
SCAM."

27:18.800 --> 27:20.166
THEN I SAID TO MYSELF, YOU KNOW

27:20.166 --> 27:20.533
WHAT?

27:20.533 --> 27:21.800
WHEN I STARTED TO PUT $10,000 A

27:21.800 --> 27:22.600
DAY ON HER, RIGHT ON HER, YOU

27:22.600 --> 27:23.200
KNOW, ON HER TABLE, THEN SHE'S

27:23.200 --> 27:24.000
GONNA SAY, "WHOA!"

27:26.100 --> 27:27.367
>> John: OH, WOMEN, AM I RIGHT?

27:27.367 --> 27:28.166
ALWAYS NAGGING YOU TO NOT GET

27:28.166 --> 27:29.166
SUCKED INTO GET-RICH-QUICK

27:29.166 --> 27:30.367
SCHEMES, LEAVING YOUR MARRIAGE

27:30.367 --> 27:38.133
IN A STATE OF FINANCIAL RUIN.

27:38.133 --> 27:39.300
BLAH, BLAH, BLAH, BLAH, BLAH.

27:39.300 --> 27:39.934
BITCONNECT!

27:39.934 --> 27:41.100
THIS WON'T SURPRISE YOU:

27:41.100 --> 27:41.700
BITCONNECT ESSENTIALLY

27:41.700 --> 27:42.500
COLLAPSED.

27:42.500 --> 27:43.300
REGULATORS IN TWO STATES ISSUED

27:43.300 --> 27:44.133
CEASE-AND-DESIST ORDERS, AND

27:44.133 --> 27:45.166
BITCONNECT'S REPORTEDLY BEEN

27:45.166 --> 27:46.300
LABELED A PONZI SCHEME BY MANY

27:46.300 --> 27:47.667
IN THE INDUSTRY, SOMETHING

27:47.667 --> 27:48.900
NOBODY HAD ANY REASON TO SUSPECT

27:48.900 --> 27:50.367
FROM THEIR PROMOTIONAL MATERIAL,

27:50.367 --> 27:53.400
EXCEPT THAT IT FEATURED THIS

27:53.400 --> 27:54.633
ACTUAL ILLUSTRATION OF THEIR

27:54.633 --> 27:55.900
BONUS SYSTEM, WHICH SEEMS TO

27:55.900 --> 27:56.533
JUST BE A PICTURE OF A MAN

27:56.533 --> 27:57.200
COMING UP WITH THE IDEA FOR A

27:57.200 --> 28:01.300
PYRAMID SCHEME.

28:01.300 --> 28:02.900
AND I AM NOT SAYING EVERY

28:02.900 --> 28:04.367
CRYPTOCOIN IS A SCAM, JUST AS

28:04.367 --> 28:05.300
I'M NOT SAYING THAT EVERY

28:05.300 --> 28:08.333
BLOCKCHAIN COMPANY IS BULLSHIT.

28:08.333 --> 28:09.800
WHAT I AM SAYING IS, IN A

28:09.800 --> 28:11.100
SPECULATIVE MANIA, IT CAN BE

28:11.100 --> 28:12.066
INCREDIBLY HARD TO TELL WHICH

28:12.066 --> 28:13.367
COMPANIES ARE FOR REAL.

28:13.367 --> 28:17.333
AND IF YOU WANT A GOOD EXAMPLE

28:17.333 --> 28:21.600
OF THIS, JUST LOOK AT BLOCK.ONE.

28:21.600 --> 28:25.233
IT'S A STARTUP WHOSE COIN

28:25.233 --> 28:26.800
OFFERING HAS SO FAR RAISED

28:26.800 --> 28:29.200
$1.5 BILLION, WHICH WILL GO

28:29.200 --> 28:31.367
TOWARD DEVELOPING A NEW TYPE OF

28:31.367 --> 28:32.033
SOFTWARE PROJECT CALLED EOS.

28:32.033 --> 28:32.900
JUST FOR CONTEXT, IT TOOK

28:32.900 --> 28:33.633
FACEBOOK SEVEN YEARS TO RAISE A

28:33.633 --> 28:34.333
BILLION DOLLARS FROM INVESTORS.

28:34.333 --> 28:35.033
IT TOOK UBER FIVE YEARS.

28:35.033 --> 28:35.767
EOS SURPASSED THAT IN AROUND

28:35.767 --> 28:36.500
NINE MONTHS.

28:36.500 --> 28:37.433
AND THAT'S DESPITE THE FACT THE

28:37.433 --> 28:38.400
"WALL STREET JOURNAL" DESCRIBED

28:38.400 --> 28:40.367
BLOCK.ONE AS "A SOFTWARE STARTUP

28:40.367 --> 28:46.467
THAT DOESN'T PLAN TO SELL ANY

28:46.467 --> 28:47.367
SOFTWARE AND DESCRIBES WHAT IT

28:47.367 --> 28:49.166
IS SELLING -- A DIGITAL TOKEN --

28:49.166 --> 28:50.133
AS HAVING NO PURPOSE."

28:50.133 --> 28:51.300
AND WHILE THE COMPANY INSISTS

28:51.300 --> 28:52.400
EOS WILL BE "THE MOST POWERFUL

28:52.400 --> 28:53.033
INFRASTRUCTURE FOR DECENTRALIZED

28:53.033 --> 28:53.633
APPLICATIONS," WHICH THEY SAY

28:53.633 --> 28:55.066
WILL BE "USABLE," IT HASN'T

28:55.066 --> 28:55.734
LAUNCHED YET.

28:55.734 --> 28:56.700
SO YOU SORT OF JUST HAVE TO TAKE

28:56.700 --> 29:00.633
THEIR WORD FOR IT.

29:00.633 --> 29:01.834
AND THEY DO TALK A BIG GAME.

29:01.834 --> 29:04.667
>> EVERYTHING WILL BE BETTER,

29:04.667 --> 29:06.967
FASTER, AND CHEAPER.

29:06.967 --> 29:07.834
EVERYTHING WILL BE MORE

29:07.834 --> 29:08.700
CONNECTED.

29:08.700 --> 29:09.934
EVERYTHING WILL BE MORE

29:09.934 --> 29:11.033
TRUSTWORTHY.

29:11.033 --> 29:12.233
EVERYTHING WILL BE MORE SECURE.

29:12.233 --> 29:13.734
EVERYTHING THAT EXISTS IS NO

29:13.734 --> 29:14.567
LONGER GOING TO EXIST IN THE WAY

29:14.567 --> 29:17.967
THAT IT DOES TODAY.

29:17.967 --> 29:19.967
EVERYTHING IN THIS WORLD IS

29:19.967 --> 29:25.200
ABOUT TO GET BETTER.

29:25.200 --> 29:26.266
>> John: OH, PLEASE, DOUCHE.

29:26.266 --> 29:27.200
EVERYTHING THAT EXISTS WILL NO

29:27.200 --> 29:28.033
LONGER EXIST IN THE WAY IT DOES?

29:28.033 --> 29:29.834
HOW THE FUCK IS EOS GOING TO

29:29.834 --> 29:34.233
CHANGE THIS IGUANA?

29:34.233 --> 29:45.800
HOW IS EOS GOING TO

29:45.800 --> 29:46.734
BOTH ALTER AND IMPROVE SUSAN

29:46.734 --> 29:47.433
HERE?

29:47.433 --> 29:48.266
SUSAN IS ENOUGH!

29:48.266 --> 29:49.066
THAT SLEEPY CREEPY COWBOY FROM

29:49.066 --> 29:49.767
THE FUTURE IS NAMED

29:49.767 --> 29:50.934
BROCK PIERCE.

29:50.934 --> 29:52.467
HE BEGAN HIS CAREER APPEARING IN

29:52.467 --> 29:53.033
"THE MIGHTY DUCKS" AND IN A

29:53.033 --> 29:53.633
GUSHERS COMMERCIAL AS A

29:53.633 --> 29:54.667
CHILD WHO TURNS INTO A BANANA.

29:54.667 --> 29:55.533
THAT BANANA THEN GOT INVOLVED

29:55.533 --> 29:56.734
WITH SOME UNSAVORY FIGURES --

29:56.734 --> 29:58.133
JUST GOOGLE "BROCK PIERCE

29:58.133 --> 29:59.066
SCANDAL" IS ALL I'M SAYING --

29:59.066 --> 30:00.066
AND THEN HE TEAMED UP WITH EOS

30:00.066 --> 30:01.367
TO HELP PROMOTE THEIR

30:01.367 --> 30:04.500
NOT-YET-A-PRODUCT.

30:04.500 --> 30:06.033
HE ACTUALLY GAVE A SPEECH AT A

30:06.033 --> 30:08.367
TECH CONFERENCE LAST FALL, AND I

30:08.367 --> 30:10.000
WANT YOU TO REMEMBER AS YOU

30:10.000 --> 30:12.734
LISTEN TO EVERY WORD HE'S ABOUT

30:12.734 --> 30:15.934
TO SAY: THE COMPANY HE'S

30:15.934 --> 30:16.633
DESCRIBING HAS RAISED

30:16.633 --> 30:17.433
$1.5 BILLION.

30:17.433 --> 30:18.233
>> THIS IS A CHESTAHEDRON THAT

30:18.233 --> 30:19.266
I'M WEARING, WHICH IS THE LOGO

30:19.266 --> 30:19.834
OF EOS.

30:19.834 --> 30:20.767
THE CHESTAHEDRON IS THE SACRED

30:20.767 --> 30:22.433
GEOMETRICAL SHAPE OF THE HEART.

30:22.433 --> 30:23.066
AND IF YOU'RE GONNA BRING A

30:23.066 --> 30:24.333
TECHNOLOGY TO THE WORLD THAT HAS

30:24.333 --> 30:25.800
THE POTENTIAL TO CHANGE

30:25.800 --> 30:27.000
EVERYTHING, IT'S GOOD WHEN YOU

30:27.000 --> 30:27.900
DO IT WITH INTENTION, AND THAT

30:27.900 --> 30:29.033
SEEMS LIKE A GOOD PLACE TO

30:29.033 --> 30:30.700
BEGIN.

30:30.700 --> 30:31.800
THIS WAS MY WEDDING AT

30:31.800 --> 30:33.066
BURNING MAN LAST YEAR.

30:33.066 --> 30:34.033
IT WAS AN ENTIRELY UNICORN

30:34.033 --> 30:35.233
WEDDING.

30:35.233 --> 30:37.533
ALL THE GROOMSMEN WORE THE

30:37.533 --> 30:39.133
COLOR OF THE RAINBOW PLUS PINK,

30:39.133 --> 30:39.834
ALL THE BRIDESMAIDS, THE COLOR

30:39.834 --> 30:41.166
OF THE RAINBOW PLUS PINK, AND MY

30:41.166 --> 30:42.333
BEST MAN WAS A WOMAN DRESSED IN

30:42.333 --> 30:44.700
BLACK CRACKING A WHIP.

30:44.700 --> 30:46.100
>> John: OKAY, STOP, BROCK.

30:46.100 --> 30:48.834
STOP.

30:48.834 --> 30:53.700
BECAUSE I WAS ALREADY OUT AT

30:53.700 --> 30:55.667
CHESTAHEDRON, AND I SIMPLY

30:55.667 --> 30:57.000
REFUSE TO BELIEVE THAT A MAN WHO

30:57.000 --> 30:58.433
HAS THE TIME TO ORGANIZE A

30:58.433 --> 31:01.300
UNICORN WEDDING AT BURNING MAN

31:01.300 --> 31:02.500
SHOULD BE TRUSTED AROUND

31:02.500 --> 31:03.100
$1.5 BILLION.

31:03.100 --> 31:03.867
IF SOMEONE TURNED UP TO MOW YOUR

31:03.867 --> 31:04.600
LAWN AND GAVE YOU THAT EXACT

31:04.600 --> 31:05.500
SPEECH, YOU WOULD TELL THEM,

31:05.500 --> 31:06.367
"NO WAY.

31:06.367 --> 31:07.367
I DON'T TRUST YOU WITH MY LAWN.

31:07.367 --> 31:08.233
YOU'RE JUST GOING TO ORGANIZE A

31:08.233 --> 31:12.100
WARLOCK QUINCEANERA ON IT."

31:12.100 --> 31:13.467
LOOK, LOOK, HERE'S THE THING.

31:13.467 --> 31:16.333
AT THE START OF THIS PIECE, I

31:16.333 --> 31:17.233
SAID I DIDN'T WANT TO MAKE

31:17.233 --> 31:17.700
PREDICTIONS.

31:17.700 --> 31:18.500
AND WHO KNOWS?

31:18.500 --> 31:19.500
MAYBE EOS IS GOING TO BE THE

31:19.500 --> 31:20.166
NEXT GOOGLE.

31:20.166 --> 31:21.000
I DON'T THINK IT IS.

31:21.000 --> 31:21.600
AND I CERTAINLY DON'T THINK IT

31:21.600 --> 31:22.367
CAN BE WORTH OVER A BILLION

31:22.367 --> 31:22.900
DOLLARS AT THIS POINT.

31:22.900 --> 31:25.934
BUT I COULD BE WRONG.

31:25.934 --> 31:26.567
I'M ABSOLUTELY NOT, BUT I COULD

31:26.567 --> 31:27.500
BE.

31:27.500 --> 31:28.200
THE POINT IS, IF YOU CHOOSE TO

31:28.200 --> 31:29.533
INVEST IN THE CRYPTOCURRENCY

31:29.533 --> 31:30.266
SPACE, JUST KNOW THAT YOU'RE NOT

31:30.266 --> 31:31.266
INVESTING, YOU'RE GAMBLING.

31:31.266 --> 31:34.433
WHICH IS FINE, BUT YOU SHOULD

31:34.433 --> 31:35.166
KNOW THAT THAT IS WHAT YOU'RE

31:35.166 --> 31:35.867
DOING.

31:35.867 --> 31:37.266
AND PRICES DO GO DOWN.

31:37.266 --> 31:38.934
BITCOIN COULD EVENTUALLY BE

31:38.934 --> 31:40.400
WORTHLESS, OR IT COULD BE WORTH

31:40.400 --> 31:41.433
BILLIONS AND ADOPTED AS A NEW

31:41.433 --> 31:44.934
GLOBAL CURRENCY.

31:44.934 --> 31:45.633
ALTHOUGH IF THAT DOES HAPPEN, I

31:45.633 --> 31:46.700
WON'T EXPERIENCE IT, BECAUSE

31:46.700 --> 31:47.633
I'LL BE IN AN UNDERGROUND

31:47.633 --> 31:48.500
BUNKER TRYING TO AVOID

31:48.500 --> 31:49.567
DAN'S SMUG LITTLE FACE FOR THE

31:49.567 --> 31:50.767
REST OF TIME.

31:50.767 --> 31:51.734
I HATE YOUR BELTS MORE THAN

31:51.734 --> 31:54.467
ANYTHING ELSE IN THAT PHOTO.

31:54.467 --> 31:56.100
THE IMPORTANT THING TO REMEMBER

31:56.100 --> 31:57.700
IS THAT THIS IS A BRAND-NEW,

31:57.700 --> 31:58.700
VERY COMPLICATED SPACE, AND

31:58.700 --> 31:59.567
LITERALLY NOBODY KNOWS HOW IT'S

31:59.567 --> 32:01.000
GOING TO DEVELOP.

32:01.000 --> 32:02.667
SO YOU NEED TO BE CAREFUL.

32:02.667 --> 32:04.367
AND I KNOW THAT SOUNDS BORING.

32:04.367 --> 32:05.667
CAUTION IS A TOUGH SELL WHEN

32:05.667 --> 32:06.800
YOU'RE UP AGAINST BITCONNECT AND

32:06.800 --> 32:11.233
HODL GANG.

32:11.233 --> 32:12.233
WHICH IS WHY I HAVE INVITED A

32:12.233 --> 32:13.367
SPECIAL GUEST TO HELP MAKE THAT

32:13.367 --> 32:15.667
MESSAGE A LITTLE MORE EXCITING.

32:15.667 --> 32:17.600
>> HEY, HEY, HEY!

32:24.000 --> 32:29.834
HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY!

32:29.834 --> 32:32.333
HEY!

32:32.333 --> 32:33.900
WASSA-WASSA-WASSA-WASSA-

32:33.900 --> 32:35.200
WASSA-WASSA-WASSA-WASSA-

32:35.200 --> 32:38.166
WASSUP?

32:38.166 --> 32:42.600
WHOO!

32:42.600 --> 32:46.834
I AM REALLY SO THRILLED RIGHT

32:46.834 --> 32:49.667
NOW TO BE SHARING THIS SUPER

32:49.667 --> 32:50.600
EXCITING HUNKY-DORY MAGIC MIKE

32:50.600 --> 32:51.767
MOMENT WITH ALL OF YOU!

32:51.767 --> 32:53.600
BECAUSE TONIGHT WE ARE GOING TO

32:53.600 --> 32:54.834
BE TALKING ABOUT

32:54.834 --> 32:59.500
RESPONSIBILITY!

32:59.500 --> 33:01.967
>> John: OH, RESPONSIBILITY,

33:01.967 --> 33:02.333
RESPONSIBILITY.

33:02.333 --> 33:02.834
YOU HAVE TO TELL ME

33:02.834 --> 33:05.767
MORE ABOUT THIS RESPONSIBILITY.

33:05.767 --> 33:06.233
DOES THIS MEAN

33:06.233 --> 33:07.133
I SHOULDN'T JUST THROW

33:07.133 --> 33:07.934
EVERYTHING I OWN INTO

33:07.934 --> 33:12.266
CRYPTOCURRENCIES?

33:12.266 --> 33:15.800
>> THAT'S RIGHT, JOHN, THAT'S

33:15.800 --> 33:16.967
RIGHT.

33:16.967 --> 33:20.300
>> John: I SHOULDN'T?

33:20.300 --> 33:21.300
>> MM, NO, NO, NO!

33:21.300 --> 33:22.900
NO-NO-NO-NO-NO.

33:22.900 --> 33:24.233
>> John: NO?

33:24.233 --> 33:25.734
>> MM, NO-NO-NO-NO-NO-NO.

33:25.734 --> 33:26.567
THE CRYPTO MARKET IS EXTREMELY

33:26.567 --> 33:27.200
VOLATILE AND INSUFFICIENTLY

33:27.200 --> 33:27.834
REGULATED.

33:27.834 --> 33:28.600
THEY PUMP.

33:28.600 --> 33:29.233
THEY DUMP.

33:29.233 --> 33:30.000
THEY PUMP 'N' DUMP 'N' PUMP 'N'

33:30.000 --> 33:30.800
DUMP 'N' PUMP!

33:30.800 --> 33:32.133
PUMPIN' IT AND DUMPIN' IT AND

33:32.133 --> 33:35.600
PUMPIN' IT AND DUMPIN' IT.

33:35.600 --> 33:38.367
>> John: ALL THE TIME.

33:38.367 --> 33:41.533
>> THEY DUMP.

33:41.533 --> 33:42.800
LISTEN UP, BITTIES AND

33:42.800 --> 33:44.100
GENTLECOINS, INVESTING IN CRYPTO

33:44.100 --> 33:46.433
COULD BE LIKE GETTING IN ON

33:46.433 --> 33:53.300
GOOGLE ON THE GROUND FLOOR!

33:53.300 --> 33:54.400
>> John: WHEN YOU SAY THAT,

33:54.400 --> 33:55.333
THAT SOUNDS ABSOLUTELY GREAT.

33:55.333 --> 33:56.033
>> OR IT COULD BE LIKE GETTING

33:56.033 --> 33:56.700
IN ON GOOGLE GLASS ON THE GROUND

33:56.700 --> 33:57.767
FLOOR.

33:57.767 --> 33:59.266
AND THAT TURNED OUT TO BE

33:59.266 --> 34:01.100
A ONE-STORY BUILDING!

34:01.100 --> 34:02.066
>> John: THAT WAS A SINGLE

34:02.066 --> 34:05.934
STORY.

34:05.934 --> 34:07.266
LET'S BREAK THIS DOWN.

34:07.266 --> 34:08.567
WHAT'S THE BIG LESSON

34:08.567 --> 34:09.800
HERE?

34:09.800 --> 34:10.834
>> NEVER INVEST ANY MORE THAN

34:10.834 --> 34:12.734
YOU'RE WILLING TO LOSE.

34:12.734 --> 34:16.266
AND IF YOU DO, DON'T JUST

34:16.266 --> 34:22.667
BLINDLY HODL.

34:22.667 --> 34:23.166
INSTEAD, YOU HAVE TO BE

34:23.166 --> 34:26.066
EXTREMELY CRAEFUL.

34:26.066 --> 34:28.867
YOU HAVE TO BE EXTREMELY CRAEFUL

34:28.867 --> 34:31.667
CRAEFUL.

34:31.667 --> 34:34.867
