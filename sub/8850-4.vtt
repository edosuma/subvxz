USED TO BE THE YOUNG SQUAW,
AND SHE'S LAZY TOO.

04:51.058 --> 04:54.428

04:54.528 --> 04:56.964
AND NEITHER ONE OF THEM
IS DOING ANYTHING BUT FIGHTIN'.

04:57.064 --> 04:59.467
AND THAT'S WHY I SLEEP

04:59.567 --> 05:00.834
OH, NOW,
I MIGHT GO DOWN THERE

05:00.934 --> 05:03.637

UNDER HIS SKIN.

05:42.943 --> 05:45.613
THEY WATCHED HIM
SLOW ROAST.

05:45.713 --> 05:47.515
