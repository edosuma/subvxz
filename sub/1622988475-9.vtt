I don't know why you're so smug.
That photo proves nothing.

It proves you were there.
You killed Carlo and now,

to keep quiet.

since the murder
of Isabel Duarte.

01:12.159 --> 01:14.465

established herself

guests with lovely compliments,

But none of her new friends
seemed to notice

01:33.876 --> 01:36.748
the darkness behind her eyes.

01:36.792 --> 01:39.099
It was the look of a woman

Absolutely. We need new blood.

Can anyone toss their hat
in the ring?

for me as president.

10:20.184 --> 10:21.708
Like what?

10:21.751 --> 10:24.754
Like why is Mrs. Yost
buried in our garden?

10:30.760 --> 10:33.545
These are copies of the autopsy
for the Castillo guy

10:33.589 --> 10:35.199
and the lady
who confessed to killing him.

10:35.243 --> 10:37.680
-That was his maid, Isabel.
-Right.

10:37.724 --> 10:39.943
So, the millionaire died
with two drugs in his system.

10:39.987 --> 10:43.773
Uh, first an analgesic,
which sedates and reduces pain;

10:43.817 --> 10:45.688
the other was...

10:45.732 --> 10:47.908
potassium chloride.

10:47.951 --> 10:49.866
So, I'm thinking that the maid

10:49.910 --> 10:52.390
got him relaxed first,
so he didn't feel any pain.

10:52.434 --> 10:54.392
And then,
she went in for the kill.

10:54.436 --> 10:56.525
And she used the same
combination to kill herself?

10:56.568 --> 10:58.048
No. That's where it gets weird.

10:58.092 --> 11:01.530
She didn't use an analgesic,
just potassium chloride.

11:01.573 --> 11:03.706
[shudders]
That is nasty stuff.

11:03.750 --> 11:05.839
That's a horrible way to die.

11:05.882 --> 11:07.579
-Doesn't make sense, does it?
-No.

11:07.623 --> 11:08.929
Listen, I got to go.

11:08.972 --> 11:10.844
If the coroner finds out
I'm talking to you...

11:10.887 --> 11:12.193
Joe, wait.

11:12.236 --> 11:14.586
Where would someone go
to buy these drugs?

11:14.630 --> 11:16.110
Well, any pharmacy could do it.

11:16.153 --> 11:18.112
But you're going to need
to be some kind of doctor

11:18.155 --> 11:19.766
if you want to write
a prescription.

11:28.426 --> 11:29.906
If I may ask,

11:29.950 --> 11:32.779
how did you
happen to find Mrs. Yost?

11:32.822 --> 11:34.694
Rocco was digging.

11:34.737 --> 11:36.565
I walked over and...

11:36.608 --> 11:39.263
Wh-What does it matter?

11:39.307 --> 11:42.484
The question is,
how did she get there?

11:44.573 --> 11:46.401
Right. Well...

11:47.794 --> 11:51.232
Do you remember the night
I told you not to come home?

11:51.275 --> 11:53.974
That your father and I
needed to talk?

11:54.017 --> 11:57.368
You were upset because Daddy
was seeing another woman.

11:57.412 --> 11:59.719
Yes, I was.

12:01.198 --> 12:02.504
Wait.

12:02.547 --> 12:04.158
Was it Mrs. Yost?

12:04.201 --> 12:05.420
Yes.

12:05.463 --> 12:08.205
Once I found out,
I put a stop to it but...

12:08.249 --> 12:09.859
When he told her it was over,

12:09.903 --> 12:12.775
she ran over here
in a drunken rage,

12:12.819 --> 12:14.603
and she tried to kill me.

12:14.646 --> 12:16.213
What?

12:16.257 --> 12:17.867
Yes. Yes.

12:17.911 --> 12:20.043
She, uh, she broke in.

12:20.087 --> 12:22.785
And she ran upstairs,
and threatened me,

12:22.829 --> 12:24.787
with a knife, and I screamed.

12:24.831 --> 12:27.703
And Bertie came up
and he shoved her, hard.

12:27.747 --> 12:29.226
And she fell out the window,

12:29.270 --> 12:31.359
right on top
of my gardening shears.

12:34.144 --> 12:35.711
It was awful.

12:36.712 --> 12:38.670
So, why didn't you
call the police?

12:39.889 --> 12:42.805
Bertie wanted to,
but I panicked.

12:42.849 --> 12:44.764
I was worried
that he'd be arrested.

12:46.069 --> 12:47.462
Please, you can't tell anyone.

12:47.505 --> 12:49.116
Oh, Mom.

12:49.159 --> 12:52.249
Our family's survival
is at stake. Please.

12:52.293 --> 12:54.295
You can't even tell Vern.

12:54.338 --> 12:57.254
Vern is my husband.

12:57.298 --> 12:59.169
He's also a detective,

12:59.213 --> 13:00.997
with friends in law enforcement.

13:01.041 --> 13:02.520
Uh, you'd be...

13:02.564 --> 13:04.348
you'd be putting him
in a terrible position.

13:07.482 --> 13:09.266
Okay.

13:09.310 --> 13:10.833
Fine. I won't tell Vern...

13:10.877 --> 13:12.356
or anyone.

13:12.400 --> 13:14.489
But just because I'm willing
to keep your secret

13:14.532 --> 13:16.012
doesn't mean I'm not furious.

13:16.056 --> 13:18.841
Yes. Oh.

13:18.885 --> 13:21.801
You got yourself in a very
stupid situation, Mother.

13:21.844 --> 13:23.324
Yes, well...

13:23.367 --> 13:25.674
No one ever said
I was brilliant.

13:33.725 --> 13:35.727
[snoring]

13:39.731 --> 13:40.689
-[door slams]
-[gasps]

13:40.732 --> 13:42.125
Oh. Rona.

13:42.169 --> 13:43.735
Right.

13:43.779 --> 13:44.998
Who have we got next?

13:45.041 --> 13:46.695
I believe...

13:46.738 --> 13:48.262
[groans]

13:48.305 --> 13:50.481
Mrs. Portman
and her bloody poodle.

13:50.525 --> 13:52.048
She's not coming.

13:52.092 --> 13:54.790
I canceled the rest
of your appointments today.

13:54.834 --> 13:56.357
Why?

13:56.400 --> 13:58.315
I'm sorry, but...

13:58.359 --> 14:00.578
if your patients see you
like this,

14:00.622 --> 14:03.712
all drunk and sloppy,

14:03.755 --> 14:05.192
they might not come back.

14:06.193 --> 14:08.238
Yes, you're right. I just...

14:08.282 --> 14:11.502
I haven't been myself recently.

14:11.546 --> 14:12.982
I'm so sorry.

14:13.026 --> 14:14.505
You know what you need?

14:14.549 --> 14:17.552
Some food and some good,
strong coffee.

14:17.595 --> 14:20.468
I'm going to need a little
bit more than that.

14:20.511 --> 14:22.470
I'm sorry.

14:25.995 --> 14:27.388
[purring softly]

14:27.431 --> 14:29.433
[doorbell rings]

14:35.483 --> 14:37.877
You changed the locks?

14:37.920 --> 14:39.313
Hello, Rita.

14:39.356 --> 14:40.618
Take a seat.

14:40.662 --> 14:42.229
This is my house.

14:42.272 --> 14:43.883
I offer the seats around here,

14:43.926 --> 14:45.275
and you can't have one.

14:45.319 --> 14:46.407
Now, get out.

14:46.450 --> 14:49.062
Jail hasn't been kind
to your face.

14:49.105 --> 14:52.935
A few weeks behind bars,
and you look five years older.

14:52.979 --> 14:54.458
I'm serious.

14:54.502 --> 14:56.852
If you're not gone in ten
minutes, I'll call the police.

14:56.896 --> 14:59.637
You're a far cry
from that pretty, young thing

14:59.681 --> 15:02.727
that my father met
in that El Paso whorehouse.

15:05.208 --> 15:06.993
What are you talking about?

15:08.603 --> 15:10.953
The letters you wrote to Isabel,
back in Texas,

15:10.997 --> 15:14.087
gave my detectives
a lot of leads to follow.

15:14.130 --> 15:16.480
What a colorful life you've led.

15:16.524 --> 15:18.308
You had me investigated?

15:18.352 --> 15:19.875
Yes.

15:19.919 --> 15:22.356
And I know about your first
marriage, back in Galveston.

15:22.399 --> 15:25.185
Harry Jaworski.

15:25.228 --> 15:27.187
Look familiar?

15:28.362 --> 15:30.712
Hmm. Handsome fellow.

15:30.755 --> 15:32.496
I'm impressed.

15:32.540 --> 15:34.324
He beat me.

15:34.368 --> 15:36.109
Is that why you shot him?

15:36.152 --> 15:37.719
I didn't shoot him.

15:37.762 --> 15:39.199
Isabel did.

15:39.242 --> 15:40.548
Good old Isabel.

15:40.591 --> 15:43.159
Always there to take the blame.

15:43.203 --> 15:44.682
She's dead.

15:44.726 --> 15:46.119
Yes, she is.

15:46.162 --> 15:48.904
But sadly for you, Harry's not.

15:49.949 --> 15:51.037
What?

15:51.080 --> 15:52.952
I know. It's a miracle.

15:52.995 --> 15:54.736
He survived the gunshot.

15:54.779 --> 15:56.346
See?

15:57.608 --> 15:59.915
And you know what else?

15:59.959 --> 16:01.656
He never remarried.

16:01.699 --> 16:03.745
And you never divorced him.

16:03.788 --> 16:05.660
So, Harry is still your husband.

16:07.488 --> 16:09.055
No. No.

16:09.098 --> 16:10.534
Carlo was my husband.

16:10.578 --> 16:12.406
Not legally.

16:12.449 --> 16:14.538
So, the bequests
he made for his wife,

16:14.582 --> 16:16.105
it doesn't apply to you.

16:17.150 --> 16:18.499
You get nothing.

16:18.542 --> 16:21.284
Not the house,
not the furniture.

16:21.328 --> 16:22.503
Nothing.

16:22.546 --> 16:25.419
But thanks for stopping by.

16:34.080 --> 16:35.646
This isn't over.

16:35.690 --> 16:37.866
My lawyer
will have something to say.

16:37.909 --> 16:39.128
Sure.

16:39.172 --> 16:43.306
He'll say,
"Where's my damn money, Rita?"

16:43.350 --> 16:46.092
Catherine, stop it, please.

16:46.135 --> 16:47.789
Scooter?

16:47.832 --> 16:49.312
What are you doing here?

16:50.357 --> 16:51.923
He lives here.

16:51.967 --> 16:54.317
You told him he would someday.

16:54.361 --> 16:57.103
Aren't you glad
I made good on your promise?

16:57.146 --> 16:59.279
[scoffs] You're with Catherine?

17:00.932 --> 17:03.065
The news isn't all bad.

17:03.109 --> 17:06.677
You thought you were a widow,
and you're not.

17:06.721 --> 17:08.636
Otto.

17:08.679 --> 17:11.813
Show Mrs. Jaworski out.

17:18.646 --> 17:21.823
ALMA:
I was so sorry to hear
that Joan fired you.

17:21.866 --> 17:24.869
She always accuses her maids
of stealing.

17:24.913 --> 17:26.697
I think it's because
she loses things

17:26.741 --> 17:28.525
and would rather
hold the help responsible.

17:28.569 --> 17:30.179
Not this time.

17:30.223 --> 17:31.441
I stole, all right.

17:31.485 --> 17:32.964
Straight out of her purse.

17:34.009 --> 17:35.489
Well...

17:35.532 --> 17:37.578
With what Joan pays you,
who could blame you.

17:37.621 --> 17:38.796
[chuckles]

17:38.840 --> 17:40.624
So what exactly
is your game here, lady?

17:40.668 --> 17:42.104
You don't know me from Adam.

17:42.148 --> 17:43.584
Why do you care I got fired?

17:43.627 --> 17:46.152
Aren't you delightfully blunt?

17:46.195 --> 17:49.024
I'm running against Joan to be
president of the Garden Club.

17:49.068 --> 17:52.201
And you know how nasty
these campaigns can be.

17:52.245 --> 17:55.422
And you thought 'cause
that snotty bitch fired me,

17:55.465 --> 17:56.858
that I'd dish the dirt.

17:56.901 --> 17:59.817
I have no interest
in smearing Joan publicly.

17:59.861 --> 18:02.559
But our last president
was accused of murder.

18:02.603 --> 18:04.735
We can't afford another scandal.

18:04.779 --> 18:06.259
I'm just so worried

18:06.302 --> 18:10.306
that Joan might have some
nasty skeleton in her closet.

18:10.350 --> 18:12.178
Honestly...

18:13.353 --> 18:14.571
She's got a big one.

18:14.615 --> 18:18.009
Miss Snooty is having an affair.

18:18.053 --> 18:20.403
Don't know who the fella is,

18:20.447 --> 18:22.101
but she sees him every Tuesday

18:22.144 --> 18:25.104
and Friday afternoon
at 1:30, on the dot.

18:26.192 --> 18:27.976
Her husband thinks
she's playing bridge,

18:28.019 --> 18:31.936
but, uh, she's
at the Sunset Palace Hotel.

18:33.199 --> 18:35.505
How do you know
the name of the hotel?

18:35.549 --> 18:38.247
Her wallet's not all I found
in her purse.

18:41.468 --> 18:43.209
Well, all right.

18:46.125 --> 18:47.865
Isn't today Friday?

18:47.909 --> 18:50.694
Yeah. She'll be there.

18:50.738 --> 18:52.043
Wonderful.

18:53.610 --> 18:56.135
Would you like another cookie?

19:00.400 --> 19:02.184
Welcome to Tanner Drugs.

19:02.228 --> 19:03.185
My name is Yvonne.

19:03.229 --> 19:05.361
-Can I help you?
-I sure hope so.

19:05.405 --> 19:07.407
I've talked to a dozen
pharmacists today, and not one

19:07.450 --> 19:10.105
of them has been able to give me
the information I'm looking for.

19:10.149 --> 19:12.847
Mr. Tanner's out today,
but I'm his assistant.

19:12.890 --> 19:14.153
What do you need, honey?

19:14.196 --> 19:16.851
You got any record
of a customer purchasing

19:16.894 --> 19:20.028
both potassium chloride
and phenobarbital?

19:20.071 --> 19:22.204
That's an unusual combination.

19:22.248 --> 19:23.988
I wouldn't have to check
our records.

19:24.032 --> 19:25.729
I'd remember
something like that.

19:25.773 --> 19:27.688
Is that a yes or a no?

19:27.731 --> 19:30.386
Honey,
that's confidential information.

19:30.430 --> 19:32.693
Sharing that
with a total stranger

19:32.736 --> 19:34.651
is a bit risky.

19:36.000 --> 19:39.308
I got a picture in my wallet
of an American president.

19:39.352 --> 19:40.701
I could give it to you.

19:40.744 --> 19:42.398
Would that be worth the risk?

19:42.442 --> 19:44.922
If it's a picture of Washington
or Lincoln,

19:44.966 --> 19:46.707
I wouldn't say boo.

19:46.750 --> 19:49.927
But I get real talkative when
Andrew Jackson comes to town.

19:51.190 --> 19:52.930
Okay, Yvonne.

19:54.497 --> 19:56.195
It's showtime.

19:57.283 --> 20:00.024
There's this real big fella,
awful nice.

20:00.068 --> 20:02.679
He's been buying that
combination of drugs for years.

20:02.723 --> 20:04.290
-I need a name.
-Fillcot.

20:04.333 --> 20:06.205
He's a veterinarian.

20:06.248 --> 20:08.642
And once, he brought me roses

20:08.685 --> 20:10.252
from his wife's garden.

20:10.296 --> 20:12.211
Wasn't that sweet?
[chuckles]

20:20.523 --> 20:23.178
I want to tell you
about this guy I met.

20:23.222 --> 20:25.180
He's a detective, like you.

20:25.224 --> 20:27.704
But he's got
one heck of a problem.

20:27.748 --> 20:29.489
Anyone I know?

20:30.577 --> 20:31.795
Let's pretend you don't.

20:33.057 --> 20:34.581
Okay.

20:34.624 --> 20:36.887
So, this guy's got a girl,

20:36.931 --> 20:39.586
and he is crazy about her.

20:39.629 --> 20:41.022
So what's the problem?

20:41.065 --> 20:43.285
He's been investigating
a murder.

20:43.329 --> 20:45.766
And all the evidence
he's uncovered,

20:45.809 --> 20:47.071
well...

20:47.115 --> 20:49.073
It's starting to point
to his girl's father.
