- The curtain?
- Yeah, you know, like "The Wizard of Oz."

12:40.811 --> 12:46.514
Turns out the big powerful wizard
is just smoke and mirrors,

something that you don't.

13:03.834 --> 13:08.870
<i>That maybe there are truths
other than the ones you tell yourself.</i>

13:09.006 --> 13:14.376

20:08.091 --> 20:10.885
I wonder if this place has a basement.

20:11.845 --> 20:15.096
Satan didn't tell you to kill me.
I just showed up.

20:15.181 --> 20:19.600
- I can't let you live.
- Maybe I could just join you

20:19.686 --> 20:22.470
and worship with you and your buddies?

20:22.555 --> 20:25.556
- No.
- Why not?

20:25.642 --> 20:27.358
Because Satan doesn't exist, remember?

20:27.477 --> 20:29.310
I'm pretty sure you said that.

20:30.780 --> 20:35.199
Nothing more annoying than a psychopath
who engages in Socratic debate.

20:48.331 --> 20:51.332

21:02.911 --> 21:06.717
[music]

21:33.343 --> 21:34.542
Now what?

21:36.546 --> 21:38.462
You okay? What's wrong?

21:47.440 --> 21:49.307
Hey.

21:56.482 --> 21:58.699
[sighs]

21:59.903 --> 22:05.289
- You look beautiful.
- Sorry, Kim. I'm not into girls.

22:05.408 --> 22:11.045
- My name is Lilith.
- No, it's not.

22:11.915 --> 22:17.218
You asked me how the sex was
when I met Declan.

22:19.589 --> 22:22.206
It was transcendent.

22:22.926 --> 22:25.259
<i>Like he was occupying my soul.</i>

22:25.345 --> 22:28.179
- It was rape.
- No.

22:28.264 --> 22:33.901
- You were a child.
- And he made me a woman.

22:41.611 --> 22:42.693
[grunts]

22:42.779 --> 22:44.946
- Hey, her car.
- What?

22:45.081 --> 22:47.081
Her car is in there.

22:48.418 --> 22:50.251
Give me a hand.

23:03.099 --> 23:05.716
<i>- This her car?
- Yeah.</i>

23:07.020 --> 23:09.937
- There's blood here.
- Shit.

23:32.495 --> 23:34.128
Hey, Hood.

23:34.213 --> 23:39.000
<i>- What?
- Diprivan. Brand name for Propofol.</i>

23:39.085 --> 23:40.885
<i>Same shit that killed Michael Jackson.</i>

23:41.004 --> 23:43.504
- What's it used for?
- General anesthesia.

23:43.589 --> 23:46.641
So what the fuck is
it doing in a garage?

23:48.845 --> 23:53.347
<i>[thuds, crashes] Brock?
Hey.</i>

23:53.348 --> 23:57.168

Killers, rapists,
drug dealers...

25:04.053 --> 25:06.420
all walking the streets
because of you.

25:06.556 --> 25:08.422
No, it's Proctor.
It's Proctor.

25:08.508 --> 25:11.342
He threatened me.
I swear to God, he threat...

25:11.427 --> 25:16.097
You...
are the goddamn district attorney.

25:16.182 --> 25:18.182
[choking]

25:18.267 --> 25:22.987
He...
He threatened my family.

25:23.106 --> 25:25.439
I have three kids. Please.

25:25.575 --> 25:27.408
Please don't do this.
[sobs]

25:27.493 --> 25:29.493
[gasps]

25:30.947 --> 25:34.582
I want to know about everything
Proctor has his hands in.

25:35.952 --> 25:37.451
I only know what he wants me to know.

25:37.537 --> 25:39.453
- Are you lying to me?
- No.

25:39.539 --> 25:42.873
No, wait. Wait, wait, wait.
Wait.

25:42.959 --> 25:46.961
Last week...
last week he made my office

25:47.046 --> 25:49.880
seize all the tower records
from the old municipal airport.

25:49.966 --> 25:52.767
Why? Who's flying in?

25:54.604 --> 25:56.937
Emilio Loera.

25:58.608 --> 26:00.524
Loera?

26:00.643 --> 26:03.894
He's a major player in
the Colombian cartel.

26:03.980 --> 26:06.230
Proctor's selling to the cartel?

26:06.315 --> 26:08.032
I don't know.
I swear to God, I don't know.

26:08.151 --> 26:10.284
I'd tell you if I did.

26:14.874 --> 26:17.124
[gasping]

26:17.210 --> 26:19.743
- Go home.
- What?

26:19.829 --> 26:21.912
You just quit.

26:21.998 --> 26:26.798
Get your kids and get
the hell out of Banshee.

26:31.084 --> 26:34.831
[music]

26:36.596 --> 26:38.562

26:44.420 --> 26:47.021
[echoing] Hey, Hood.

26:49.692 --> 26:51.992
The dizziness comes in waves.

26:53.529 --> 26:55.830
<i>They must have drugged us.</i>

26:56.949 --> 26:59.950
[chains rattling]
[groans]

27:00.036 --> 27:01.952
You got any give on your cuffs?

27:04.090 --> 27:08.425
- No.
- Yeah, me neither.

27:08.544 --> 27:10.594
What is this?

27:11.764 --> 27:15.099
I don't know.
Some sort of basement.

27:18.271 --> 27:20.187
Of course.

27:21.140 --> 27:23.390
Did you get a look at him?

27:26.646 --> 27:28.229
He came to visit me the other night.

27:28.314 --> 27:30.814
- Who did?
- Bode.

27:34.537 --> 27:39.373
You saw him?
Why the fuck didn't you say anything?

27:39.458 --> 27:45.246
I don't know. Maybe I was...
spooked.

27:46.332 --> 27:47.581
<i>He knocked me out.</i>

27:47.667 --> 27:51.418
And when I came to, he
had a knife to my throat.

27:51.504 --> 27:55.256
He could have killed me right there,

27:55.391 --> 27:57.424
but he didn't.

27:59.011 --> 28:01.979
Said he wanted me to bear witness.

28:02.098 --> 28:04.899
- To what?
- I don't know.

28:06.402 --> 28:07.935
But I'm guessing we're
about to find out.

28:08.020 --> 28:12.239
So Dawson probably showed up
and got the same treatment.

28:12.325 --> 28:14.441
She might still be here.

28:14.577 --> 28:16.443
<i>Brock: If she's not already dead.</i>

28:16.579 --> 28:18.279
[grunting]

28:18.364 --> 28:21.282
Hey, I applaud your effort,
but you're not gonna break out

28:21.367 --> 28:23.367
of stainless steel cuffs, okay?

28:23.452 --> 28:26.337
You don't break the cuffs.
You work the links.

28:27.456 --> 28:29.540
If you're lucky, there's a defect.

28:29.625 --> 28:34.795
- Why don't you try yours again?
- All right.

28:39.185 --> 28:41.185
Ah, fuck.

28:41.304 --> 28:43.687
My right hand is a little loose.

28:43.806 --> 28:46.140
If I can just get
a little more leverage.

28:46.275 --> 28:48.359
They're solid. Stop it.

28:48.477 --> 28:51.478
Hood. Hood. Stop!
[Lucas grunting]

28:51.614 --> 28:54.365
<i>Hey, hey, look at me.
Give it up, all right?</i>

28:54.483 --> 28:56.483
We're not getting out of here.

29:06.879 --> 29:09.046
You know what sucks about this?

29:09.165 --> 29:11.715
I mean, besides the fact
that we're gonna die.

29:13.836 --> 29:17.537
I never got to be the
sheriff I wanted to be.

29:19.425 --> 29:23.060
I waited so long for this.
I waited for one sheriff to die.

29:23.179 --> 29:25.062
And then I had to wait
for you to burn out,

29:25.181 --> 29:28.182
which you did in such a big way.

29:28.317 --> 29:30.401
- No offense.
- None taken.

29:30.519 --> 29:33.437
I mean, okay, so I'm not
the most charming guy.

29:33.522 --> 29:36.774
I rub some people the wrong way
and, you know, I can't kiss ass.

29:36.859 --> 29:39.300
It's just not in my nature, you know?

29:39.335 --> 29:42.112
But I've never been afraid
to stand up to anybody

29:42.198 --> 29:44.865
who threatened the
well-being of my town.

29:46.335 --> 29:49.953
I wanted to be that guy, you know?

29:50.039 --> 29:53.497
The guy that made people feel safe.

29:56.178 --> 29:58.345
And I haven't done that.

30:07.390 --> 30:11.725
Hey.
Can I ask you something?

30:11.811 --> 30:14.061
- Be the last time.
- What?

30:15.231 --> 30:17.197
Who the fuck are you?

30:18.067 --> 30:22.152
<i>Really.
Who are you?</i>

30:22.238 --> 30:23.904
Look, I know you got
a lot of secrets, Hood.

30:24.040 --> 30:25.406
I'd be an idiot not to acknowledge that.

30:25.541 --> 30:26.824
No, we're not gonna
do that condemned men

30:26.909 --> 30:29.076
confess their sins shit, all right?

30:29.211 --> 30:31.662
- Yeah, I think that's exactly what we're gonna...
- No, we're not.

30:31.747 --> 30:33.747
Any minute now, that door is gonna open

30:33.833 --> 30:36.917
and something very bad
is gonna walk through it.

30:37.002 --> 30:39.386
Now, don't you want to meet
this with a clean conscience?

30:39.472 --> 30:41.588
- No, shut the fuck up.
- Come on, Hood, please listen.

30:41.674 --> 30:43.640
Then just answer the
fucking question for me!

30:43.759 --> 30:45.676
<i>- I said drop it, Brock!
- No, I'm not gonna drop it!</i>

30:45.761 --> 30:49.012
I want to know! Why are you here?
Why did you become a cop?

30:49.098 --> 30:53.434
I am not a cop!
I never was a fucking cop!

30:53.519 --> 30:55.269
<i>What are you...?</i>

30:55.354 --> 30:58.672
<i>- What does that... what does that mean?
- I'm not Lucas Hood!</i>

31:00.242 --> 31:01.275
<i>I saw him die.</i>

31:01.410 --> 31:05.412
I picked up his wallet and I became him.

31:05.498 --> 31:08.282
That's not even possible.
I don't... What are you...

31:08.417 --> 31:12.169
I'm a lie, Brock. I'm a fake.

31:12.288 --> 31:14.004
I was a thief.

31:14.123 --> 31:18.292
Not just a thief,
I'm a fucking infiltration specialist.

31:18.377 --> 31:21.712
<i>Diamonds, gold, art,
anything, I could get it.</i>

31:21.797 --> 31:25.132
The places no one could
get into, I got in.

31:27.470 --> 31:32.022
I had a good run,
but I got caught and I did 15 years.

31:32.141 --> 31:35.476
No, no. You're fucking with me.

31:35.611 --> 31:40.697
Come on.
You're an ex-con? No.

31:40.816 --> 31:43.367
<i>- That's right.
- No.</i>

31:49.542 --> 31:53.627
Who else knows about it?
Siobhan know?

31:54.997 --> 32:00.000
- In the end, yeah.
- Why would you do that? Why?

32:00.136 --> 32:03.170
Why would you come to this town
and pretend to be a cop?

32:03.305 --> 32:06.223
I don't know. I...

32:08.677 --> 32:10.677
When I got out...

32:12.181 --> 32:14.181
I had nothing.
[music]

32:15.684 --> 32:20.654
Whoever I was before... was gone.

32:23.242 --> 32:24.908
I was no one.

32:26.662 --> 32:29.830
<i>All I knew is I needed to be close...</i>

32:31.000 --> 32:33.534
to the one person who...

32:35.171 --> 32:37.171
who really knew me.

32:40.543 --> 32:44.795
- Carrie Hopewell?
- Ana.

32:46.382 --> 32:48.515
She was all I had.

32:50.019 --> 32:55.923
So when I got out, I tracked
her down and I came for her.

32:57.142 --> 33:00.727
But she had Gordon and
the kids and a life.

33:00.813 --> 33:02.362
<i>That's right.</i>

33:02.448 --> 33:05.032
Oh, my God.

33:05.117 --> 33:09.486
<i>I became... sheriff.</i>

33:14.877 --> 33:17.411
But you're not. You weren't.

33:17.546 --> 33:21.164
Well, I was getting up every day,
putting on the uniform.

33:23.052 --> 33:27.888
Eventually the... lie took over.

33:30.843 --> 33:35.429
I believed it.
I was... I was the sheriff.

33:40.236 --> 33:43.470
I was a cop and I liked it.

33:45.741 --> 33:47.941
I fucking loved it.

33:51.614 --> 33:53.580
Somehow it just...

33:56.035 --> 33:58.118
[sighs]
Somehow it just felt right.

33:58.254 --> 34:00.621
There's nothing fucking
right about what you did.

34:00.756 --> 34:03.257
It is the opposite of right.

34:03.342 --> 34:07.844
<i>You son of a bitch.
I believed you.</i>

34:07.963 --> 34:10.179
I trusted you. I followed you.

34:10.299 --> 34:13.467
- I killed for you.
- No.

34:13.552 --> 34:15.719
No, you killed for you.

34:16.804 --> 34:19.940
Not me.
I just showed you the way.

34:21.060 --> 34:24.444
A criminal. [laughs]

34:24.530 --> 34:29.783
That's rich.
I was deputy to a criminal.

34:31.620 --> 34:33.704
Oh, God.

34:35.407 --> 34:37.658
[laughing]

34:37.793 --> 34:39.793
Oh, God.

34:42.498 --> 34:44.414
Oh, God.

34:52.091 --> 34:54.474
It all makes sense now.

34:56.312 --> 34:58.428
All of it.

35:02.351 --> 35:04.484
I'm so stupid.

35:12.745 --> 35:14.328
[laughs]

35:22.087 --> 35:24.371
If you're not Lucas Hood...

35:25.374 --> 35:29.591
what's your name?
[door opens]

35:29.712 --> 35:31.595
Sheriff Lotus.

35:33.132 --> 35:35.932
It's good to see you again.

35:36.969 --> 35:38.435
And you.

35:38.554 --> 35:42.723
Dr. Quick tells me you're
friends with Agent Dawson.

35:42.808 --> 35:47.060
That's right.
And if you've hurt her in any way...

35:48.230 --> 35:50.397
I'm gonna fucking kill you.

35:52.901 --> 35:56.992
- You fellas are in for a treat tonight.
- Yeah?

35:57.027 --> 35:59.456
You gonna con another poor
girl into burning herself to a crisp?

35:59.575 --> 36:01.041
Gail was a true believer.

36:01.126 --> 36:04.461
No, she was a confused
and vulnerable young girl

36:04.580 --> 36:07.998
who you manipulated for
your own sick pleasure.

36:16.675 --> 36:18.258
[groans]

36:22.598 --> 36:26.066
It looks like you're going
to be my guests tonight.

36:26.151 --> 36:31.679
Thing is, we have a dress code,
so Dr. Quick is going to work

36:31.680 --> 36:36.493
his magic and make you look
a little more like family.

36:49.159 --> 36:53.731
[music]

37:02.971 --> 37:05.138
You bust into my office.

37:09.394 --> 37:11.478
You steal my camera.

37:14.533 --> 37:19.152
I gotta say,
I was hoping we would meet again.

37:20.456 --> 37:24.241
Gather round, everybody.
It's almost time to begin.

37:24.242 --> 37:28.242
[music]

37:38.891 --> 37:41.975
We have an unexpected offering tonight.

37:42.060 --> 37:45.061
<i>I think he will be pleased.</i>

37:46.265 --> 37:47.647
<i>Declan: Gloria Satanas.</i>

37:47.733 --> 37:50.317
<i>All: Satanas vobiscum.</i>

37:52.604 --> 37:56.740
<i>- Gloria Satanas.
- Satanas vobiscum.</i>

37:58.327 --> 37:59.526
<i>Gloria Satanas.</i>

37:59.661 --> 38:04.581
Don't worry, Sheriff.
This won't hurt a bit.

38:04.700 --> 38:08.001
<i>Well, maybe a little bit.</i>

38:10.038 --> 38:14.674
<i>Here we go. Gloria Satanas
et Belial et Spiritui maloso.</i>

38:14.760 --> 38:19.629
<i>All: Sicut erat in principo,
et nunc, et semper,</i>

38:19.715 --> 38:22.215
<i>et in saecula saeculorum.</i>

38:22.301 --> 38:25.406
Brock: No, no.
Stay the fuck away from me.

38:25.441 --> 38:28.104
Stay away!
Stay the fuck away from me!
