00:07.475 --> 00:08.109
- In the criminal justice
system,

00:08.142 --> 00:09.143
sexually based offenses

00:09.177 --> 00:12.113
are considered
especially heinous.

00:12.146 --> 00:14.382
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives

00:14.415 --> 00:16.284
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:16.317 --> 00:17.551
are members of an elite squad

00:17.585 --> 00:19.787
known as
the Special Victims Unit.

00:19.820 --> 00:22.323
These are their stories.

00:26.460 --> 00:27.528
- [sighs]

00:27.561 --> 00:30.831
[rings doorbell]
Trick or treat!

00:30.864 --> 00:32.533
[laughter]
Hi, Mom.

00:32.566 --> 00:35.536
- Ellis, honey, come in.

00:35.569 --> 00:39.173
- There you go.
- Oh! Patrick, look!

00:39.207 --> 00:41.375
Aren't these beautiful?
- Ooh, nice.

00:41.409 --> 00:44.612
both: Hey!

00:44.645 --> 00:47.115
- Oh, wow. Mm.

00:47.148 --> 00:49.117
[sniffs] Oh, I should have
never moved out.

00:49.150 --> 00:52.120
- Yeah, but then who would
bring me very expensive wine?

00:52.153 --> 00:53.454
- You like it?
Bordeaux.

00:53.487 --> 00:56.257
It's mostly cab,
a little Merlot.

00:56.290 --> 00:58.426
My boss recommended it...

00:58.459 --> 01:00.561
Right after he gave me
a promotion.

01:00.594 --> 01:03.131
- What?
- Yep, you're looking at

01:03.164 --> 01:05.199
Goldman Sachs'
newest fixed income trader.

01:05.233 --> 01:07.435
- What is that,
200, 300 grand a year?

01:07.468 --> 01:09.237
Double what I make.

01:09.270 --> 01:11.172
- Oh, honey,
we're so proud of you.

01:11.205 --> 01:13.241
- Thanks, Mom. Thanks.
- Oh, let's celebrate.

01:13.274 --> 01:15.143
[cell phone vibrates]
- Yeah, yeah,

01:15.176 --> 01:17.278
I can't stay too long.
- I know.

01:17.311 --> 01:20.248
It's Halloween weekend.
You've got parties.

01:20.281 --> 01:22.550
- Don't be too hungover
tomorrow morning.

01:22.583 --> 01:25.253
We are going to clean
that garage.

01:25.286 --> 01:27.588
Unless, of course,
you are too big time

01:27.621 --> 01:29.257
to help out your old man.

01:29.290 --> 01:31.659
[laughter]

01:55.583 --> 01:58.352
- Hi. I'm Ellis.

01:58.386 --> 02:01.489
Who are you supposed to be?
- My cousin, Janie.

02:01.522 --> 02:03.257
And we're going to dance.

02:03.291 --> 02:05.526
Without you.

02:07.261 --> 02:11.232
- Wait. He's cute.
- [chuckles] No.

02:20.508 --> 02:24.345
- Hey, here.
Let me.

02:27.548 --> 02:29.683
Secret stash.

02:29.717 --> 02:34.255
- Okay.
Uh, Jordan Spieth.

02:34.288 --> 02:36.957
- [laughs]
Oh, this isn't a costume.

02:36.990 --> 02:38.392
It's just what I wear.

02:38.426 --> 02:42.396
Plus, my--my hairline
is way more solid.

02:42.430 --> 02:44.398
Do you like golf?
- No.

02:44.432 --> 02:48.436
- No?
- See you out there.

03:00.448 --> 03:03.684
- [sighs]

03:07.421 --> 03:09.657
Oh, I'm--I'm sorry.

03:09.690 --> 03:12.293
The door was unlocked.

03:12.326 --> 03:13.327
Are you all right?

03:13.361 --> 03:16.264
- I know you.
Evan.

03:16.297 --> 03:20.334
- [laughs] Ellis.
- Oh. [laughs]

03:20.368 --> 03:23.704
You--

03:23.737 --> 03:27.441
It's really hot in here.

03:27.475 --> 03:29.710
- [chuckles]

03:29.743 --> 03:32.446
- Hey, get off me.
- Get away from her.

03:32.480 --> 03:33.981
- What are you doing?
- What's your problem, dude?

03:34.014 --> 03:35.583
All right, dude. It's cool.
- I'm not looking

03:35.616 --> 03:36.650
to get into it with you, mate.
- Okay, then get

03:36.684 --> 03:38.552
the hell out of here, mate.

03:38.586 --> 03:40.321
- What? Are you kidding?
What? you called the cops?

03:40.354 --> 03:41.422
- One of you call 911?
- I did.

03:41.455 --> 03:42.390
- Nothing's
going on here, okay?

03:42.423 --> 03:46.727
- This guy raped that girl.
- No, no, no.

03:46.760 --> 03:47.595
What are you talking about?

03:47.628 --> 03:48.462
No, I did not, I--
- Step back, sir.

03:48.496 --> 03:50.364
- I did not, no, listen!
This is crazy.

03:50.398 --> 03:51.599
Okay, this is--
I didn't do anything.

03:51.632 --> 03:53.834
I did not--
I did not do anything.

03:53.867 --> 03:56.304
[cell phone beeps]

03:56.337 --> 03:58.472
I didn't--

04:04.578 --> 04:07.415
- Hey, Lieutenant.

04:07.448 --> 04:09.016
- Hey, I'm on my way home.
What do we got?

04:09.049 --> 04:11.619
- Possible attempted rape, 122.
- No, that's not what happened.

04:11.652 --> 04:14.488
- Where's the vic?
- Mercy. Rollins is on her way.

04:14.522 --> 04:16.724
- [sighs]
Put him in interrogation.

04:16.757 --> 04:18.292
- Let's go.
- Go on to the interview room.

04:18.326 --> 04:19.827
- Yeah, he did not
witness anything.

04:19.860 --> 04:21.629
- All right, hey,
would you just have a seat?

04:21.662 --> 04:23.497
- No, the English dude,
okay, what he thought he saw,

04:23.531 --> 04:24.465
he was mistaken.

04:24.498 --> 04:27.335
Okay, just let me explain.
This'll all go away.

04:27.368 --> 04:29.770
All right?
- Eh, I don't think so.

04:29.803 --> 04:31.805
It's already gone viral.

04:37.811 --> 04:40.781
[dramatic music]

04:40.814 --> 04:47.821
*

05:24.425 --> 05:27.661
- Okay, Rollins.
Yeah, keep us posted.

05:27.695 --> 05:30.598
- Our vic, Janie Spears,
still unconscious,

05:30.631 --> 05:32.366
high blood alcohol.

05:32.400 --> 05:33.501
And this kid's
claiming consensual?

05:33.534 --> 05:36.069
- Yeah. Ellis Griffin,
says he met Janie at a party.

05:36.103 --> 05:38.105
They were having
al fresco sex in the park,

05:38.138 --> 05:41.141
when a tourist, Brian Dancy,
"misinterpreted,"

05:41.174 --> 05:42.543
called 911.

05:42.576 --> 05:45.145
- A he-said, he-said,
she-can't-say.

05:45.178 --> 05:47.014
- Okay.
And Ellis was drinking, too?

05:47.047 --> 05:49.016
- Yeah, from the smell
of it, a lot.

05:49.049 --> 05:50.584
- He ask for a phone call?
Lawyer?

05:50.618 --> 05:52.152
- Nah, he's eager
to tell us his side.

05:52.185 --> 05:53.987
- All right,
let's get him some coffee.

05:54.021 --> 05:55.589
Get a statement.

05:55.623 --> 05:58.559
Fin?
- British Brian, on it.

05:58.592 --> 06:00.160
[sighs]

06:00.193 --> 06:02.596
[cell phone beeps]
- Hey, Lucy, I'm so sorry.

06:02.630 --> 06:05.433
I'm gonna be even later.
Bye.

06:07.167 --> 06:09.470
- Hey, Ellis.
- Hi.

06:09.503 --> 06:12.606
I brought you some coffee.
- No, I'm okay.

06:12.640 --> 06:15.443
- I'm Lieutenant Benson.

06:15.476 --> 06:18.546
We just wanted to make sure that
you're clear-minded enough

06:18.579 --> 06:21.449
to answer some questions.

06:21.482 --> 06:25.018
So, Ellis, why don't we start
by you telling us

06:25.052 --> 06:26.620
what happened tonight.

06:26.654 --> 06:29.156
- I was at a Halloween party.

06:29.189 --> 06:30.858
Janie--Janie and I met.

06:30.891 --> 06:32.760
We were dancing,
we were hanging out, drinking,

06:32.793 --> 06:34.762
dancing, etcetera.

06:34.795 --> 06:37.598
- Ellis, uh, we need details.

06:37.631 --> 06:39.500
So it'd be helpful
if you could expand on

06:39.533 --> 06:41.802
that whole "etcetera" part.
- I'm a little nervous.

06:41.835 --> 06:43.637
Not 'cause I did
anything wrong--

06:43.671 --> 06:47.475
- Ellis, take your time.
All right?

06:47.508 --> 06:49.109
Just--just tell us
what happened.

06:49.142 --> 06:52.746
- Uh, I, uh, it really started
um, when I ran into her

06:52.780 --> 06:54.715
in the bathroom.

06:54.748 --> 06:57.851
She said she wanted some air,
so we went outside.

06:57.885 --> 06:59.787
- Okay, you remember
what time that was?

06:59.820 --> 07:02.623
- I don't--
after midnight?

07:02.656 --> 07:04.124
I don't know.
She seemed drunk,

07:04.157 --> 07:06.560
but she was fine.
- "Fine"?

07:06.594 --> 07:08.762
"Fine"? What does that mean?
- She was, uh, she was talking.

07:08.796 --> 07:10.664
She was laughing.

07:10.698 --> 07:13.667
Um, yeah, so we
walked through the park.

07:13.701 --> 07:14.602
That's when she kissed me.

07:14.635 --> 07:18.138
Yeah, but I swear to God,
she was into it.

07:18.171 --> 07:21.241
- That girl was not into it.
- How could you tell that?

07:21.274 --> 07:24.678
- She wasn't moving.
He was on top of her, thrusting.

07:24.712 --> 07:25.879
- Okay, so what did you do?

07:25.913 --> 07:28.482
- I shouted, "Stop."
Perv didn't hear me.

07:28.516 --> 07:30.250
He was getting off
on a helpless girl.

07:30.283 --> 07:31.685
So I called 911.

07:31.719 --> 07:33.687
- What'd you do
till the cops showed up?

07:33.721 --> 07:36.524
- I went to pull him off her,
he stood up, zipped his fly.

07:36.557 --> 07:39.860
Said, "She's fine."
- But she wasn't.

07:39.893 --> 07:42.229
- All right, so you
and Janie are kissing.

07:42.262 --> 07:44.632
- Mm-hmm.
- Right. So how does it--

07:44.665 --> 07:46.534
how does it move past that?

07:46.567 --> 07:49.670
- Um, so--

07:49.703 --> 07:51.572
Yeah, we--we--
we were getting into it

07:51.605 --> 07:56.276
and, uh, yeah,
I felt her pull at my belt.

07:56.309 --> 07:57.410
- Keep going.

07:57.444 --> 08:00.881
- She fell back onto a pile of
garbage bags that were--

08:00.914 --> 08:02.583
were stacked up.

08:02.616 --> 08:03.851
Okay, and I--
[sighs]

08:03.884 --> 08:06.554
I fell on top of her,
and when we--

08:06.587 --> 08:08.889
when we got our bearings, it--
[laughs]

08:08.922 --> 08:12.960
And we--it felt
kinda romantic, you know?

08:12.993 --> 08:14.895
And--

08:14.928 --> 08:17.965
I kissed her again.
And--and then we--

08:17.998 --> 08:20.267
- And you--
- We started--

08:20.300 --> 08:23.170
we started to have sex.

08:23.203 --> 08:24.404
Okay, I know it--
it's not great.

08:24.437 --> 08:27.675
It's not great to have sex like
that by the garbage, I know.

08:27.708 --> 08:29.877
But that--that's what it was.
That is what it was.

08:29.910 --> 08:33.547
It was sex between
two consenting adults.

08:33.581 --> 08:35.315
- She consented?

08:35.348 --> 08:37.885
You heard her say, "Yes"?
- Yes.

08:37.918 --> 08:40.253
Yes! Yes, we were enjoying
each other the whole time.

08:40.287 --> 08:42.890
Until the--the British guy
started yelling at us

08:42.923 --> 08:44.658
and the cops showed up.
- Okay, Ellis,

08:44.692 --> 08:47.928
well, the British guy,
our witness,

08:47.961 --> 08:51.298
he said it seemed like
she was unconscious to him.

08:51.331 --> 08:54.201
- [sighs] Oh, yeah, maybe--
maybe she fell asleep.

08:54.234 --> 08:59.807
Okay, but saying I raped her,
that is crazy.

08:59.840 --> 09:02.643
- Okay, Ellis, I can see
why you might feel that way.

09:02.676 --> 09:05.579
- [sighs] I feel like that
because that is the truth.

09:05.613 --> 09:07.848
[cell phone dings]
- Ask Janie.

09:07.881 --> 09:10.651
- Uh, we will.

09:10.684 --> 09:12.720
Janie just came to.

09:13.821 --> 09:15.856
Be right back.

09:19.059 --> 09:21.328
- Janie, do you know
why you're here?

09:21.361 --> 09:23.363
- Because I'm an idiot
and got alcohol poisoning.

09:23.396 --> 09:26.266
- You were found in the park,
um, last night,

09:26.299 --> 09:29.737
lying next to
some garbage bags.

09:29.770 --> 09:30.738
- That's why my hair stinks.

09:30.771 --> 09:34.207
- And when you were found,
you were unconscious.

09:34.241 --> 09:37.945
Do you remember being there
with--with anyone?

09:37.978 --> 09:40.313
- No, I don't.

09:40.347 --> 09:42.916
Like who?
- A witness said

09:42.950 --> 09:45.786
they saw you with a man.

09:45.819 --> 09:48.822
Do you recall
having sex last night?

09:48.856 --> 09:51.859
- No. I don't.

09:51.892 --> 09:56.664
I didn't, okay?
I-I remember--

09:56.697 --> 09:58.365
I remember being at the party.

09:58.398 --> 10:00.600
- Did you leave there
with someone?

10:06.774 --> 10:11.011
- I don't know who I was with.

10:11.044 --> 10:13.914
Oh, my God, that's why
I'm sore down there.

10:13.947 --> 10:17.250
- We'd like to do a rape kit.
- A rape kit?

10:17.284 --> 10:18.852
I don't have insurance.

10:18.886 --> 10:19.887
How much is it?

10:19.920 --> 10:21.855
- It's no charge.

10:21.889 --> 10:24.024
- Uh, there's
a Leah Simes here.

10:24.057 --> 10:25.726
- That's my cousin.
- Okay.

10:25.759 --> 10:28.028
She was at the party.
- Yeah, she's been calling you.

10:28.061 --> 10:30.964
- Can I see her, please?
- Yeah.

10:30.998 --> 10:32.399
- You're Detective Rollins?
- Yeah.

10:32.432 --> 10:33.500
- Talking to Janie
about what happened.

10:33.533 --> 10:35.936
- Janie, are you okay?
- Yeah, what happened to me?

10:35.969 --> 10:38.271
- You were raped.
- How do you know that?

10:38.305 --> 10:39.840
- It's all over the Internet.
People have been

10:39.873 --> 10:41.975
tweeting about it,
calling her Garbage Rape Girl,

10:42.009 --> 10:43.777
thrown out with the trash.

10:43.811 --> 10:45.412
- They're saying that
somebody had sex with me

10:45.445 --> 10:47.280
while I was passed out?

10:47.314 --> 10:49.082
- Janie, you had a lot
to drink last night.

10:49.116 --> 10:51.018
Now do you remember
consenting to sex?

10:51.051 --> 10:53.954
- No, I never would have said
"Okay" on the ground like that.

10:53.987 --> 10:54.988
- He raped her.

10:55.022 --> 10:58.058
That son of a bitch
raped my cousin.

11:01.328 --> 11:04.364
[door opens]

11:04.397 --> 11:06.133
- Someplace you gotta be
on Saturday?

11:06.166 --> 11:09.369
- Uh, I'm supposed to help
my father clean out the garage.

11:09.402 --> 11:11.872
- Ellis, um,
we spoke with Janie.

11:11.905 --> 11:14.341
And she doesn't remember
what happened.

11:14.374 --> 11:15.943
- Maybe I could talk to her.

11:15.976 --> 11:17.811
All right, I'm sure she'd
remember if she sees my face.

11:17.845 --> 11:19.813
- Yeah, well, that may be,
but we can't do that right now.

11:19.847 --> 11:22.415
- But we would like is to take
a DNA sample from you.

11:22.449 --> 11:25.052
Now, you can volunteer.
- Or we can make a call.

11:25.085 --> 11:26.754
We can get a warrant.
- No, no, no, no, no.

11:26.787 --> 11:28.355
No, you don't have to do that.
- Okay, good,

11:28.388 --> 11:31.158
'cause I'll need your consent.
- I really, really

11:31.191 --> 11:32.726
have to get out of here.

11:32.760 --> 11:34.461
- Well, this will be quick.

11:34.494 --> 11:37.731
Open your mouth.

11:37.765 --> 11:39.466
- Liv, we have a situation.

11:39.499 --> 11:44.137
Carisi, you may want to
step out, too.

11:46.439 --> 11:47.975
- What's up?
- Kid's father's shutting down

11:48.008 --> 11:49.943
the interview.
- Well, he can't do that.

11:49.977 --> 11:51.444
Ellis is 22.
He didn't ask for a lawyer.

11:51.478 --> 11:53.180
- Who is this guy?
- He says he's on the job

11:53.213 --> 11:58.085
from Nassau County, PD.

11:58.118 --> 11:59.486
- Patrick?

11:59.519 --> 12:03.857
- Olivia.
- Patrick Griffin.

12:03.891 --> 12:06.426
- You two know each other?

12:16.804 --> 12:16.937
.

12:17.670 --> 12:19.006
- I didn't know that
you had a son.

12:19.039 --> 12:19.973
- Ellis didn't show up
this morning.

12:20.007 --> 12:22.309
He wasn't answering calls,
so I traced his cell

12:22.342 --> 12:24.311
and I thought maybe
he was mugged or worse.

12:24.344 --> 12:27.014
- He's fine. He's unhurt.
- Why is he in

12:27.047 --> 12:29.216
an interrogation room?
- He's under investigation.

12:29.249 --> 12:32.285
- For what?
- For rape.

12:32.319 --> 12:34.187
- He is not answering
any more questions.

12:34.221 --> 12:36.389
- Okay, he won't
be questioned further

12:36.423 --> 12:37.424
without an attorney present.

12:37.457 --> 12:40.493
- I want any statements
that he's made thrown out.

12:40.527 --> 12:42.996
- You know that
I can't do that.

12:43.030 --> 12:44.397
Look, he came in
voluntarily.

12:44.431 --> 12:46.967
This isn't
a custodial situation.

12:47.000 --> 12:48.201
He didn't ask for a lawyer.

12:48.235 --> 12:50.103
He didn't tell us
that his father was a cop.

12:50.137 --> 12:54.441
- I'm taking him out of here.
- Okay.

12:54.474 --> 12:56.243
- Shoot me straight.

12:56.276 --> 12:57.444
Is there any evidence
there or--

12:57.477 --> 12:58.946
- We have a witness
who puts him

12:58.979 --> 13:01.014
on top of an unconscious vic.

13:01.048 --> 13:04.084
- I see.
So this must be a mistake.

13:06.219 --> 13:07.154
- Okay.

13:07.187 --> 13:09.222
[door opens]
- Dad, what are you doing here?

13:09.256 --> 13:10.590
- Don't say another word.
We're leaving.

13:10.623 --> 13:12.292
- Ellis, please don't
leave town.

13:12.325 --> 13:14.094
- Dad, I swear to God,
I did not rape her.

13:14.127 --> 13:16.096
I've been trying to explain.
- I know. Stop talking!

13:16.129 --> 13:18.098
Olivia, I wish I could say
it was nice to see you.

13:18.131 --> 13:20.067
Let's go.

13:22.135 --> 13:25.105
- You okay?
- Yeah.

13:25.138 --> 13:27.340
Griffin and I go way back.

13:27.374 --> 13:30.143
When I got out of the Academy,
I was assigned to the 55.

13:30.177 --> 13:33.013
And he looked out for me,
you know?

13:33.046 --> 13:35.215
He--he taught me a lot.

13:35.248 --> 13:36.316
- We went by the book,
Lieutenant.

13:36.349 --> 13:39.119
- Why didn't the kid tell us
his father was on the job?

13:39.152 --> 13:41.521
First thing I taught my son
was never talk to the cops.

13:41.554 --> 13:43.123
- Well, he doesn't think
he did anything wrong.

13:43.156 --> 13:44.424
- That was his second mistake.

13:44.457 --> 13:47.360
His first mistake was humping
a passed out girl.

13:47.394 --> 13:49.029
- We got Ellis' side
of the story.

13:49.062 --> 13:50.130
I wanna hear Janie's.

13:50.163 --> 13:52.532
- I'll let Rollins know.

13:56.136 --> 13:57.537
- Hi, Janie.

13:57.570 --> 14:01.008
I'm Lieutenant Benson,
from SVU.

14:01.041 --> 14:03.343
How are you feeling?
- A little better.

14:03.376 --> 14:05.145
When can I get
my clothes back?

14:05.178 --> 14:06.246
- When we're done
processing them.

14:06.279 --> 14:08.548
It's part of the rape kit.

14:08.581 --> 14:11.384
- That sounds so weird.

14:11.418 --> 14:13.620
That I was raped.

14:13.653 --> 14:17.124
I guess I was.

14:17.157 --> 14:20.093
- So, Janie, it's been--
it's been a few hours

14:20.127 --> 14:23.030
since you
regained consciousness.

14:23.063 --> 14:25.165
Were you able
to remember anything else?

14:25.198 --> 14:26.366
- Not really.

14:26.399 --> 14:27.467
It's still fuzzy.

14:27.500 --> 14:31.671
- Well, memory can be
a tricky thing.

14:31.704 --> 14:34.607
So anything you do recall
would be very helpful.

14:34.641 --> 14:39.512
- I vaguely remember a guy
barging into the bathroom.

14:39.546 --> 14:42.249
Leah knows him.

14:42.282 --> 14:45.418
Ellis.

14:45.452 --> 14:48.055
- Okay, I'd like to, um--

14:48.088 --> 14:49.456
I'd like to show you
some photos

14:49.489 --> 14:52.459
and so you can make an ID.

14:57.230 --> 14:58.465
- Him.

14:58.498 --> 15:01.468
Yeah, Ellis.

15:01.501 --> 15:02.602
It was him?

15:02.635 --> 15:07.340
- Well, Janie, Ellis says
that you followed him outside,

15:07.374 --> 15:10.610
willingly,
and then you kissed him.

15:10.643 --> 15:13.580
And then you had
consensual sex.

15:13.613 --> 15:15.515
- I remember kissing him.

15:15.548 --> 15:17.317
- Okay, do you remember
having sex?

15:17.350 --> 15:20.353
- No, I remember feeling guilty
about kissing him.

15:20.387 --> 15:23.156
- Yeah, but you did
kiss him willingly?

15:23.190 --> 15:25.425
- Yes.
I mean, I think so.

15:25.458 --> 15:27.327
- Why were you feeling guilty?

15:27.360 --> 15:30.497
- I broke up with
my boyfriend a week ago.

15:30.530 --> 15:33.500
I texted him last night.

15:33.533 --> 15:35.135
I don't think that
I would hook up with

15:35.168 --> 15:37.570
somebody else so soon,
especially somebody

15:37.604 --> 15:39.372
who dated Leah.

15:39.406 --> 15:41.641
- Uh--Ellis dated your cousin?

15:41.674 --> 15:43.576
- Yeah, just like, once.

15:43.610 --> 15:47.147
- I'll talk to Leah.

15:47.180 --> 15:50.450
- Okay. So, Janie,
what I'd like to do is--

15:50.483 --> 15:54.487
is go over everything
that you do remember

15:54.521 --> 15:55.488
from the beginning.

15:55.522 --> 15:57.557
Is that okay?

15:58.791 --> 16:01.361
- Ellis and I hooked up
last year.

16:01.394 --> 16:03.363
He seems nice up front,
but he's aggressive.

16:03.396 --> 16:06.433
- Aggressive in what way?
- Sexually.

16:06.466 --> 16:07.700
- Let's get back to Janie.

16:07.734 --> 16:11.304
Did you see her and him
interact at the party?

16:11.338 --> 16:13.173
- Janie thought he was hot,
but she was too drunk

16:13.206 --> 16:14.341
to realize what she wanted.

16:14.374 --> 16:17.777
- When a girl says she just
broke up with her boyfriend--

16:17.810 --> 16:19.512
- Ellis told you
Janie said that?

16:19.546 --> 16:23.416
- Yeah, and then I saw Janie
pull Ellis to the door.

16:23.450 --> 16:25.418
- So it looked like Janie
was initiating?

16:25.452 --> 16:26.619
- Absolutely.

16:26.653 --> 16:28.555
She was all over him.

16:28.588 --> 16:32.525
- Did she seem drunk?
- Not anymore than anyone else.

16:32.559 --> 16:35.395
- I'm friends with Ellis.
What he's being accused of

16:35.428 --> 16:37.230
is impossible.
- Why's that?

16:37.264 --> 16:39.399
- He's super cute.
He's got a great job.

16:39.432 --> 16:42.502
Girls throw themselves at him,
including me.

16:42.535 --> 16:44.604
He wouldn't need to
take advantage of anyone.

16:44.637 --> 16:46.606
- Janie and I were going
to share a ride home.

16:46.639 --> 16:47.807
I went to say goodbye
to my friends.

16:47.840 --> 16:50.743
When I got back,
Janie and Ellis were gone.

16:50.777 --> 16:53.313
I heard the cops are
talking to Ellis about rape?

16:53.346 --> 16:56.449
- We're just trying to figure
out exactly what happened.

16:56.483 --> 16:57.517
- [sighs]

16:57.550 --> 17:00.787
Ellis kept trying
to dance with Janie.

17:00.820 --> 17:03.423
Uh, trying to hook up.

17:03.456 --> 17:07.260
She was so wasted,
I guess he got what he wanted.

17:07.294 --> 17:08.695
- Well, the witnesses
were a wash.

17:08.728 --> 17:10.763
Some say that Janie
was too drunk to consent

17:10.797 --> 17:13.433
and some say that she was
completely fine

17:13.466 --> 17:15.568
and hanging all over Ellis.
- The rape kit?

17:15.602 --> 17:18.505
- Oh, it's positive for semen
and a match to Ellis.

17:18.538 --> 17:19.806
But he's not denying the sex.

17:19.839 --> 17:20.740
- Just the consent.
- Yes.

17:20.773 --> 17:21.874
- Which Janie still doesn't
remember giving.

17:21.908 --> 17:26.446
- Yes. And our British witness
is sticking to his story

17:26.479 --> 17:30.317
that Ellis was seen having sex
on top of the victim,

17:30.350 --> 17:31.384
who appeared unconscious.

17:31.418 --> 17:32.319
- Well, if he's credible,
that should be enough.

17:32.352 --> 17:36.589
So listen, the father,
your old partner,

17:36.623 --> 17:39.292
you--are you two close?
- Yeah, we were.

17:39.326 --> 17:40.593
- Yeah.
- He was my mentor.

17:40.627 --> 17:44.697
He was--and a friend.

17:44.731 --> 17:47.367
And now I have to call him up
and let him know

17:47.400 --> 17:51.638
that I will be arresting
his only son for rape.

17:51.671 --> 17:53.673
- [sighs]
Okay.

17:57.544 --> 17:58.611
- Thank you for coming in.

17:58.645 --> 18:00.380
- We're here voluntarily.

18:00.413 --> 18:01.881
I'm gonna sit in,
unless there's a problem.

18:01.914 --> 18:03.783
- No, not if Ellis
is okay with it.

18:03.816 --> 18:06.753
- Ellis requested that his
lawyer and father be present.

18:06.786 --> 18:08.655
- Okay.

18:08.688 --> 18:10.523
Okay, so, um,

18:10.557 --> 18:14.327
I should start by telling you
that this is serious.

18:14.361 --> 18:16.496
That Janie Spears
has been consistent.

18:16.529 --> 18:19.499
That she has no memory
of consenting.

18:19.532 --> 18:21.768
- And the rape kit confirms
it's Ellis' DNA.

18:21.801 --> 18:23.503
- Which is consistent
with his story

18:23.536 --> 18:24.637
that they had consensual sex.

18:24.671 --> 18:29.409
- We also have a witness
who saw Ellis on top of Janie

18:29.442 --> 18:30.810
and she appeared to be
incapacitated.

18:30.843 --> 18:33.880
- That is not what happened--
- Ellis, Ellis.

18:33.913 --> 18:36.349
So why are we here?

18:36.383 --> 18:39.619
- The DA's office will be
charging Ellis with rape.

18:39.652 --> 18:43.556
So we're giving you
an opportunity as a courtesy.

18:43.590 --> 18:46.559
Ellis, if there is
any part of your story

18:46.593 --> 18:48.695
that you wanna change,
any part of your story

18:48.728 --> 18:52.432
that you left out,
now is the time.

18:52.465 --> 18:54.701
Maybe we can resolve this.
- I didn't leave anything out.

18:54.734 --> 18:55.702
What I said--
- No, no.

18:55.735 --> 18:56.736
No more talking, Ellis.

18:56.769 --> 18:58.671
You're not trying
to resolve this.

18:58.705 --> 19:00.407
You're trying to bury him.

19:00.440 --> 19:01.408
- Patrick, that is not
what's happening here.

19:01.441 --> 19:04.811
- We're just trying to give him
one more chance.

19:04.844 --> 19:06.346
- Before what?

19:06.379 --> 19:08.581
Before you arrest him?

19:08.615 --> 19:10.583
I assume that you're gonna
extend him the courtesy

19:10.617 --> 19:12.452
of letting him say goodbye
to his mother?

19:12.485 --> 19:13.720
- Patrick, you need to
listen to me.

19:13.753 --> 19:17.524
- On my shield, he will be here
first thing tomorrow morning.

19:17.557 --> 19:22.495
We want nothing more than to
prove his innocence.

19:22.529 --> 19:26.899
- 8:00 a.m. tomorrow.
- Okay.

19:33.005 --> 19:36.876
[knocks on door]
- Olivia, can I have a word?

19:36.909 --> 19:39.679
- Patrick, I'm trying to be
as straight with you as I can.

19:39.712 --> 19:41.581
The evidence indicates rape.

19:41.614 --> 19:45.785
- Please, sit down.
Please.

19:48.521 --> 19:51.791
Don't do this, Olivia.
- [sighs]

19:51.824 --> 19:56.496
- I am asking you as someone
who used to be your friend.

19:56.529 --> 19:57.930
Your partner.

19:57.964 --> 20:01.434
You and I both know that
you can make this go away.

20:01.468 --> 20:04.571
- I can't.

20:04.604 --> 20:07.006
- This is our only child.

20:07.039 --> 20:10.410
It will destroy my boy.

20:11.778 --> 20:15.014
- I'm sorry, Patrick.

20:15.047 --> 20:19.652
But this is where we are.

20:19.686 --> 20:23.890
- Our first bust, you followed
a perp into a room alone.

20:23.923 --> 20:25.958
He claimed missing cash,
missing drugs.

20:25.992 --> 20:27.727
- You and I both know
that I didn't pocket

20:27.760 --> 20:28.995
those drugs or that cash.

20:29.028 --> 20:32.465
- Yeah, but if I hadn't
have testified at IAB

20:32.499 --> 20:34.601
that I was in that room--
- I would've been jammed up

20:34.634 --> 20:37.036
for a rookie mistake.
- Exactly.

20:37.069 --> 20:40.006
Just like you, Ellis made
a rookie mistake.

20:40.039 --> 20:41.608
- [sighs]
- She was drunk.

20:41.641 --> 20:43.710
He should've known better.
- Yes, he should've.

20:47.747 --> 20:50.583
This is not the same
as you and me.

20:50.617 --> 20:51.584
This is different.

20:51.618 --> 20:54.587
Your son raped
an unconscious girl.

20:58.625 --> 21:01.628
This isn't going away,
Patrick.

21:06.766 --> 21:09.902
- Then you are looking at
the fight of your life.

21:09.936 --> 21:13.440
You and the DA

21:23.049 --> 21:23.182
.

21:24.083 --> 21:24.751
- The whole case comes down
to consent.

21:24.784 --> 21:25.852
- Janie still doesn't remember,

21:25.885 --> 21:27.053
but she says she definitely
would have never had sex

21:27.086 --> 21:29.389
under those circumstances.
- Okay, when is the last time

21:29.422 --> 21:30.423
you talked to her, though?

21:30.457 --> 21:31.591
'Cause memory comes back
in pieces.

21:31.624 --> 21:33.860
- Well, I've gone over
her story a half a dozen times.

21:33.893 --> 21:36.463
She doesn't recall consent.
- Yeah, but also,

21:36.496 --> 21:37.864
she doesn't recall
not consenting.

21:37.897 --> 21:38.831
- Lucky for us,

21:38.865 --> 21:41.401
we have the British witness
in the hotel room,

21:41.434 --> 21:43.636
on NYPD's dime,
waiting to testify.

21:43.670 --> 21:46.473
- All right, and he was
20 feet away; it was dark.

21:46.506 --> 21:49.842
So are we sure
that his story is solid?

21:49.876 --> 21:50.977
- You want us to
go over it again?

21:51.010 --> 21:52.912
- Yes, I do.
And I want to make sure

21:52.945 --> 21:55.515
that we aren't missing
any other witnesses.

21:55.548 --> 21:58.084
Double check the traffic cams
by the park.

21:58.117 --> 22:00.019
See if TARU can track down
whoever took

22:00.052 --> 22:01.488
this internet picture.

22:01.521 --> 22:04.491
Maybe they know something.
- Copy that.

22:08.928 --> 22:10.597
Look, I'm just trying
to be thorough

22:10.630 --> 22:13.633
and make sure that we give you
all of the evidence.

22:13.666 --> 22:17.870
- Liv, I get that you
and the father were partners.

22:17.904 --> 22:21.541
I'm sure there was a bond.
- There was.

22:21.574 --> 22:24.877
Before all of this.

22:24.911 --> 22:26.646
[sighs]

22:26.679 --> 22:30.917
My first bust, Patrick was
upstairs securing two dealers.

22:30.950 --> 22:33.152
I was downstairs,
arresting the third,

22:33.185 --> 22:36.155
by myself in another room.

22:36.188 --> 22:38.691
There was a pile of cash,
a pile of drugs.

22:38.725 --> 22:40.627
The perp accuses me
of stealing it.

22:40.660 --> 22:46.032
Obviously, I didn't,
but IAB came after me hard...

22:46.065 --> 22:48.935
until Patrick testified that
he was with me the whole time.

22:48.968 --> 22:51.904
- He lied to save your ass.

22:51.938 --> 22:53.105
In my world,
that gets you disbarred.

22:53.139 --> 22:56.042
- Yeah, in my world,
it gets you a promotion.

22:56.075 --> 22:59.145
- Look, you don't
owe him anything, Liv.

22:59.178 --> 23:01.581
You're not pulling facts
out of thin air.

23:06.052 --> 23:07.754
There's your victim.

23:07.787 --> 23:10.122
Were you expecting her?

23:10.156 --> 23:12.191
- No.
- ...as soon as possible.

23:12.224 --> 23:14.093
- Janie.

23:14.126 --> 23:16.062
- They're calling me "dumpster
slut" all over the internet.

23:16.095 --> 23:17.129
- Okay, and we can't
control the media.

23:17.163 --> 23:18.731
But just do your best
to ignore that.

23:18.765 --> 23:20.967
- I--I can't eat.
I can't sleep.

23:21.000 --> 23:22.669
I feel anxious all the time.
- Of course, Janie,

23:22.702 --> 23:24.771
because what happened to you
is a violation.

23:24.804 --> 23:27.774
And it never,
never should have happened.

23:27.807 --> 23:29.108
We can get you counseling.

23:29.141 --> 23:31.544
- I'm already in therapy.
I go every day.

23:31.578 --> 23:32.579
It isn't helping.

23:32.612 --> 23:34.547
I just want him
to know what he did.

23:34.581 --> 23:36.749
And not tell his lawyers,
tell the press,

23:36.783 --> 23:38.951
that the "nameless
intoxicated female"

23:38.985 --> 23:41.554
is just as responsible
as he is.

23:41.588 --> 23:43.490
Just because I don't remember
what happened

23:43.523 --> 23:44.991
doesn't mean I wasn't hurt.

23:45.024 --> 23:47.660
- And we know that, and you can
tell that to the jury.

23:47.694 --> 23:49.529
- I don't wanna tell the jury.

23:49.562 --> 23:51.097
Why should it be on me
to get up there

23:51.130 --> 23:53.633
and make people believe that?
He should do it.

23:53.666 --> 23:54.767
- Are you saying
that you want us

23:54.801 --> 23:58.538
to ask the DA for a deal?

23:58.571 --> 24:01.040
- I don't want to testify.

24:01.073 --> 24:04.511
I just want an apology.

24:04.544 --> 24:08.247
- Okay.
We'll talk to the DA.

24:08.280 --> 24:11.117
- And Ellis and his family.

24:17.156 --> 24:18.658
- In the interest of
sparing the victim

24:18.691 --> 24:20.693
the ordeal of a trial,

24:20.727 --> 24:23.596
we're willing to
offer Rape Three.

24:23.630 --> 24:26.032
- An E felony.
He'd go on the registry.

24:26.065 --> 24:29.569
- Yes. For a sexual offense,
that's non-negotiable.

24:29.602 --> 24:31.838
- Jail time?
- None.

24:31.871 --> 24:34.240
Ten years probation.
- And Ellis,

24:34.273 --> 24:36.643
the victim has made a request

24:36.676 --> 24:39.045
that you make
a statement of apology

24:39.078 --> 24:41.080
after you allocute.
- He's supposed to apologize

24:41.113 --> 24:43.149
for something he didn't do?
- Patrick, please.

24:43.182 --> 24:44.784
- If this goes to trial,
we have an eyewitness,

24:44.817 --> 24:45.785
a credible victim.

24:45.818 --> 24:47.119
- Liberal New York jury pool

24:47.153 --> 24:49.689
ready to hang the privileged
rapist high.

24:49.722 --> 24:51.791
- If he's convicted, your son
could be facing seven years.

24:51.824 --> 24:54.093
- Yeah, fine.
Mom and I were talking.

24:54.126 --> 24:55.695
What if the worst happens?

24:55.728 --> 24:57.730
She said she cannot handle it
if I go to jail.

24:57.764 --> 25:00.633
- You plead guilty to a felony,
go on the registry.

25:00.667 --> 25:02.201
You will lose your job.

25:02.234 --> 25:04.737
- We both know the realities
of state penitentiary.

25:04.771 --> 25:07.039
- Your future is gone.
- For God sakes.

25:07.073 --> 25:08.775
- We're trying to
help you here.

25:08.808 --> 25:13.646
- Ellis, this is
a one-time offer.

25:13.680 --> 25:16.783
Or you can roll the dice,
go to trial.

25:16.816 --> 25:19.251
- Dad--

25:26.225 --> 25:27.694
- Ellis Griffin,
I understand

25:27.727 --> 25:30.630
you'd like to plead guilty
to rape in the third.

25:30.663 --> 25:34.801
Do you make this plea knowingly,
intelligently, and voluntarily?

25:34.834 --> 25:35.868
- Yes, I do.

25:35.902 --> 25:37.904
- Has anyone coerced
or forced you

25:37.937 --> 25:39.806
to accept this plea?

25:39.839 --> 25:41.173
- No, Your Honor.

25:41.207 --> 25:42.675
- Once it is accepted
by the court,

25:42.709 --> 25:45.177
you will be convicted of rape
in the third degree,

25:45.211 --> 25:48.581
wherein the sentence includes
probation and community service.

25:48.615 --> 25:52.184
You will also be required
to register as a sex offender.

25:52.218 --> 25:54.821
Do you understand?
- Yes.

25:54.854 --> 25:57.189
- Are you aware that
by pleading guilty,

25:57.223 --> 25:59.158
you forego your right
to a jury trial,

25:59.191 --> 26:02.194
as well as almost
all rights to appeal?

26:02.228 --> 26:04.330
- Yes.
- I understand you'd like to

26:04.363 --> 26:06.766
make a statement of apology?

26:06.799 --> 26:09.235
You may do so
when you're ready.

26:16.743 --> 26:18.778
- [clears throat]
Ladies and gentleman,

26:18.811 --> 26:21.848
on Friday night--

26:21.881 --> 26:26.853
uh, on Friday night,
October 28th,

26:26.886 --> 26:32.725
I was at a party,
and uh--

26:32.759 --> 26:35.662
[sighs] Uh, what I really want
to say to the--

26:35.695 --> 26:39.331
to the victim is, um--

26:44.303 --> 26:47.306
Is, uh--
I--I can't, I can't.

26:47.339 --> 26:48.407
I take it back, all right?

26:48.440 --> 26:49.709
I'm not--I'm not guilty.

26:49.742 --> 26:51.177
I--I take it back, I can't.

26:51.210 --> 26:53.746
- What?

26:53.780 --> 26:56.182
- Mr. Griffin, are you
retracting your allocution?

26:56.215 --> 26:57.283
- Yes.

26:57.316 --> 26:59.185
- The People rescind
their offer.

26:59.218 --> 27:01.253
- Understood. Mr. D'Angelo,
it appears as though

27:01.287 --> 27:03.923
your client is sticking to
his plea of not guilty

27:03.956 --> 27:07.727
to rape in the second,
is that correct?

27:07.760 --> 27:09.328
- [clears throat]
Apologies.

27:09.361 --> 27:11.197
Yes, uh, that is correct.

27:11.230 --> 27:12.398
- A trial date will be set.

27:12.431 --> 27:14.200
As of now,
I'm calling for a recess.

27:14.233 --> 27:18.304
- Why couldn't he
just say he's sorry?

27:18.337 --> 27:19.839
- Hey, I thought
we agreed to a deal.

27:19.872 --> 27:21.240
Did you tell him to back out?

27:21.273 --> 27:23.275
- I told him
to think about it.

27:23.309 --> 27:24.777
That if he raped that girl,

27:24.811 --> 27:26.345
he should admit it,
take the punishment.

27:26.378 --> 27:29.248
He doesn't think he did,
so I stand behind his decision.

27:29.281 --> 27:31.951
- It doesn't matter if he thinks
that he's guilty, Patrick.

27:31.984 --> 27:34.420
The law is the law.
The evidence is strong.

27:34.453 --> 27:35.855
- That's why his mother
and I are gonna

27:35.888 --> 27:37.790
sit here in
this courtroom, every day,

27:37.824 --> 27:39.291
and look every juror
in the eye

27:39.325 --> 27:43.830
and make sure that they know
that we believe in our son,

27:43.863 --> 27:45.832
and refuse to let him
be railroaded

27:45.865 --> 27:48.935
by you or anyone else.

27:48.968 --> 27:50.336
- Let's go.

27:50.369 --> 27:52.671
- Okay.
Come on, baby, let's go.

28:03.482 --> 28:03.615
.

28:03.649 --> 28:04.050
[crowd chattering]

28:11.090 --> 28:12.458
- You keep your head up.

28:12.491 --> 28:14.260
- Rapist!
- Raper!

28:14.293 --> 28:18.064
- Rapist!
[crowd shouting]

28:19.331 --> 28:21.768
- You piece of trash!
[indistinct shouting]

28:21.801 --> 28:24.036
- Rapist!

28:27.106 --> 28:29.341
- She wasn't moving.
Her eyes were closed.

28:29.375 --> 28:32.411
- And when you went to pull
Mr. Griffin off the victim,

28:32.444 --> 28:34.280
did she react?
- No.

28:34.313 --> 28:36.348
She just laid there,
sprawled out.

28:36.382 --> 28:38.084
That's when the cops arrived.

28:38.117 --> 28:40.252
- People's Exhibit Three,
Your Honor.

28:40.286 --> 28:41.253
A crime scene photo,

28:41.287 --> 28:44.256
taken by
the responding officers.

28:44.290 --> 28:46.959
Does this photo
accurately represent

28:46.993 --> 28:49.195
the state you saw
the victim in?

28:49.228 --> 28:52.231
- Yes. She was
completely passed out.

28:52.264 --> 28:56.068
- Thank you.

28:56.102 --> 28:58.971
- That photo was taken,
what, fifteen minutes

28:59.005 --> 29:01.774
after you called 911?
- More or less.

29:01.808 --> 29:03.409
- And when you saw her
lying on the ground,

29:03.442 --> 29:06.412
how could you tell
she was unconscious?

29:06.445 --> 29:08.815
- It just looked like she was.

29:08.848 --> 29:12.151
- "Looked like"?
In the dark?

29:12.184 --> 29:14.353
From 20 feet away?

29:14.386 --> 29:16.488
Did you check her pulse?
Try to revive her?

29:16.522 --> 29:18.490
- No. I called the cops.

29:18.524 --> 29:21.093
- Not an ambulance
or a doctor?

29:21.127 --> 29:23.529
- No.
- So you wanted to be a hero.

29:23.562 --> 29:26.132
But only up to a point.
- Objection.

29:26.165 --> 29:28.367
- Withdrawn.
Nothing further.

29:31.470 --> 29:34.140
- Do you remember having sex
with the defendant?

29:34.173 --> 29:35.374
- No.

29:35.407 --> 29:40.279
- Do you remember consenting
to have sex with the defendant?

29:40.312 --> 29:42.281
- No, I must have been
passed out.

29:42.314 --> 29:44.316
- Thank you.

29:47.086 --> 29:49.088
- Good afternoon,
Ms. Spears.

29:49.121 --> 29:50.389
How are you feeling?

29:50.422 --> 29:52.458
Not too anxious, I hope?

29:52.491 --> 29:55.094
- I'm fine.
- Okay, great.

29:55.127 --> 29:59.431
So just to be clear,
you don't remember the sex.

29:59.465 --> 30:01.300
You don't remember consenting.

30:01.333 --> 30:02.301
- That's right.

30:02.334 --> 30:03.836
- Do you remember not
consenting?

30:03.870 --> 30:06.372
Uh, telling Mr. Griffin
to slow down?

30:06.405 --> 30:08.841
Or stop?
- No.

30:08.875 --> 30:11.077
- Okay.

30:11.110 --> 30:14.180
Phone records indicate
that you called your cousin

30:14.213 --> 30:18.184
at about 12:30,
uh, Defense Exhibit Seven.

30:18.217 --> 30:22.621
- Leah, it's Janie.
I'm about to call Max

30:22.654 --> 30:25.324
but I called you
so you could stop me.

30:25.357 --> 30:28.494
My boyfriend. Ex.

30:28.527 --> 30:32.564
This guy is
not my boyfriend.

30:32.598 --> 30:34.400
- Is that your voice?

30:34.433 --> 30:36.402
- Yes.
- Speaking incoherently,

30:36.435 --> 30:38.604
but clearly conscious.

30:38.637 --> 30:42.108
- [sighs] Yes.

30:42.141 --> 30:46.412
- And do you remember
making that call, Ms. Spears?

30:47.947 --> 30:49.581
- No, I don't.
- No, you don't.

30:49.615 --> 30:51.884
- You don't remember
making that call, but you did.

30:51.918 --> 30:54.320
Just like you don't remember
consenting, but you did?

30:54.353 --> 30:56.488
- Objection.
- I'll allow it.

30:56.522 --> 30:59.158
Witness may answer.

30:59.191 --> 31:03.095
- [sniffs]
I was passed out.

31:03.129 --> 31:04.563
No matter what I said
or didn't say,

31:04.596 --> 31:06.465
that means he raped me.

31:06.498 --> 31:08.367
- That means he raped you?

31:08.400 --> 31:11.337
Or is that what the SVU
detectives and the DA told you?

31:11.370 --> 31:12.939
Or is that what
the internet said?

31:12.972 --> 31:14.606
Or is that what
your liberal, feminist,

31:14.640 --> 31:16.642
social justice warrior
girlfriends

31:16.675 --> 31:18.577
who hate my client said?

31:18.610 --> 31:21.580
Withdrawn.

31:21.613 --> 31:24.683
- [sniffs]

31:24.716 --> 31:27.286
- Nothing further.

31:27.319 --> 31:31.490
- Redirect, Your Honor.

31:31.523 --> 31:35.427
Janie, why do you believe
you were raped?

31:38.197 --> 31:41.300
- Because I never would have
consented to a guy I just met

31:41.333 --> 31:44.536
on the ground,
by the garbage.

31:44.570 --> 31:48.140
I was passed out and he did
what he wanted anyway.

31:48.174 --> 31:49.241
- Nothing further.

31:49.275 --> 31:50.943
The prosecution rests.

31:50.977 --> 31:52.678
- We'll adjourn for the day.

31:52.711 --> 31:54.480
Reconvene tomorrow morning
at 9:00 a.m.,

31:54.513 --> 31:56.548
when the defense
will present their case.

31:56.582 --> 31:57.683
[gavel bangs]

31:57.716 --> 32:00.586
- Approach, Your Honor?

32:01.988 --> 32:04.190
- What?

32:05.457 --> 32:07.659
- What do you mean the defense
added their own eyewitness?

32:07.693 --> 32:09.628
- Impossible, we did
a thorough canvass.

32:09.661 --> 32:11.663
- Diego Perez.
His name mean anything?

32:11.697 --> 32:13.565
- Not anyone we talked to.

32:13.599 --> 32:15.334
- I wanna know where this
witness magically came from.

32:15.367 --> 32:16.702
- Okay, so run the name.
Find out anything

32:16.735 --> 32:18.337
and everything
about this Perez.

32:18.370 --> 32:22.008
- Copy that.
- Keep me posted.

32:22.041 --> 32:23.575
- You doing okay?

32:23.609 --> 32:26.245
- Yeah, you know, long week.

32:26.278 --> 32:28.314
- Go home. You got a kid,
you got a man.

32:28.347 --> 32:30.249
- Yeah.
- How's that going,

32:30.282 --> 32:31.583
you and Tucker?

32:31.617 --> 32:35.587
- [sighs] It's complicated.

32:35.621 --> 32:40.626
[knocks on door]

32:40.659 --> 32:41.627
- Lieutenant.
- Look, I'm sorry

32:41.660 --> 32:43.462
to interrupt your evening,
but it's important

32:43.495 --> 32:47.499
and, uh, you may not
want your wife to hear.

32:47.533 --> 32:49.468
[door closes]

32:49.501 --> 32:51.570
[sighs]

32:54.240 --> 32:55.207
- What's going on?
- Well, you weren't

32:55.241 --> 32:56.475
in court this afternoon.

32:56.508 --> 32:57.609
And, uh,
at the end of the day,

32:57.643 --> 33:02.281
the defense calls a surprise
witness to testify tomorrow.

33:02.314 --> 33:03.715
- That's right.
D'Angelo said.

33:03.749 --> 33:05.251
Someone came forward.

33:05.284 --> 33:07.786
A good citizen who saw
the whole supposed rape.

33:07.819 --> 33:10.589
- Yeah. A good citizen?
- Yeah.

33:10.622 --> 33:12.558
- He's a career drug dealer

33:12.591 --> 33:16.628
who became a snitch at the 55,
your old precinct.

33:16.662 --> 33:19.365
- I don't know what
you're talking about.

33:19.398 --> 33:23.435
- Do you really
wanna do this?

33:23.469 --> 33:25.537
It's witness tampering.

33:25.571 --> 33:27.639
Obstruction.

33:27.673 --> 33:30.276
- Again, I have no idea.

33:30.309 --> 33:31.543
- You're putting
your job at risk.

33:31.577 --> 33:35.814
Your pension. Not to mention,
you could face criminal charges.

33:35.847 --> 33:41.720
- Like when I lied
to IAB for you.

33:41.753 --> 33:43.422
- We're still investigating
this witness.

33:43.455 --> 33:46.092
We're running his phone records,
his, uh, bank statements--

33:46.125 --> 33:47.659
- Okay, I get it.

33:47.693 --> 33:50.696
He's my son.
He's 22 years old.

33:50.729 --> 33:53.599
He graduated summa cum laude
from Dartmouth.

33:53.632 --> 33:55.667
He has a six-figure job.

33:55.701 --> 33:59.505
And you wanna
destroy his life...

33:59.538 --> 34:03.609
because he had sex
with some drunk girl.

34:17.756 --> 34:17.889
.

34:18.724 --> 34:19.425
- Mr. Perez, can you
tell us what you saw

34:19.458 --> 34:20.359
on you walk home
through the park

34:20.392 --> 34:23.829
at approximately 12:45
on October the 28th?

34:23.862 --> 34:25.864
- I was coming around the gate,
and it's a shortcut.

34:25.897 --> 34:27.799
I saw a man and a woman.
They were having sex

34:27.833 --> 34:28.867
on the ground.
- Do you see

34:28.900 --> 34:31.303
those individuals here today?

34:31.337 --> 34:33.139
- There and there.

34:33.172 --> 34:35.641
- I'll let the record reflect,
Mr. Perez pointed

34:35.674 --> 34:37.276
at the defendant,
Ellis Griffin,

34:37.309 --> 34:39.645
and the alleged victim,
Janie Spears.

34:39.678 --> 34:42.348
And were you able to see
if both parties

34:42.381 --> 34:44.850
were awake and conscious?

34:44.883 --> 34:47.153
- Yes, awake.
She might remember me.

34:47.186 --> 34:50.389
I caught her eye.
I was less than 15 feet away.

34:50.422 --> 34:52.391
- And was there anything
that made you think

34:52.424 --> 34:53.892
the woman might be in trouble?

34:53.925 --> 34:56.128
- No, she was
really into it, moaning.

34:56.162 --> 34:58.164
She says, "Keep going."
Halloween weekend,

34:58.197 --> 34:59.698
people do crazy things.

34:59.731 --> 35:01.200
Having sex in the park.

35:01.233 --> 35:03.235
- Nothing further.

35:06.772 --> 35:07.873
- Mr. Perez,

35:07.906 --> 35:10.376
um, five years ago,
you were arrested

35:10.409 --> 35:12.844
for criminal sale
of a controlled substance.

35:12.878 --> 35:14.246
A felony.
Is that correct?

35:14.280 --> 35:15.714
- Objection. Relevance.

35:15.747 --> 35:17.216
- It goes to credibility.

35:17.249 --> 35:19.418
- Overruled.
Witness will answer.

35:19.451 --> 35:20.752
- Yes, I was arrested.

35:20.786 --> 35:22.921
- That was your third offense.

35:22.954 --> 35:25.357
Yet you were able
to avoid jail time

35:25.391 --> 35:28.260
by agreeing to become
a confidential informant.

35:28.294 --> 35:30.662
- Yeah, so?
I'm not one anymore.

35:30.696 --> 35:32.298
- Who was your control officer?

35:32.331 --> 35:36.368
- Dennis Marino.
- A detective at the 55.

35:36.402 --> 35:39.471
- That's right. But like I said,
I'm not a CI anymore.

35:39.505 --> 35:41.373
I haven't talked to Marino
in years.

35:41.407 --> 35:45.244
- Sure.
When you were a CI,

35:45.277 --> 35:48.214
did you meet any other
detectives at the 55?

35:48.247 --> 35:49.815
- A few.

35:49.848 --> 35:52.951
- Did you ever meet
Patrick Griffin?

35:52.984 --> 35:54.886
The father of the defendant.

35:54.920 --> 35:56.655
A former officer at the 55.

35:56.688 --> 35:58.790
- Objection!
- Again, goes to credibility.

35:58.824 --> 36:00.359
- I'll allow.
- Let me ask you again,

36:00.392 --> 36:01.927
Mr. Perez, and I will remind
you, you are under oath.

36:01.960 --> 36:07.866
Did you ever
meet Patrick Griffin?

36:07.899 --> 36:09.901
- No.

36:09.935 --> 36:13.872
- But Griffin and Marino
worked together in the 55.

36:13.905 --> 36:16.208
Did you know that?
- Asked and answered.

36:16.242 --> 36:17.343
Your Honor.
- I'll allow.

36:17.376 --> 36:18.744
Witness will answer.

36:18.777 --> 36:20.279
- Like I said,
I never met the man.

36:20.312 --> 36:21.680
- Sergeant Griffin didn't
approach you

36:21.713 --> 36:23.282
or coerce you
in any way to testify

36:23.315 --> 36:25.217
on his son's behalf?

36:25.251 --> 36:27.353
- He's lying, he wasn't there!
He's making it up.

36:27.386 --> 36:29.288
Janie never said "Keep going."
- Ellis, Ellis!

36:29.321 --> 36:31.223
Sit down.
- No, I'm sorry.

36:31.257 --> 36:33.792
I'm sorry for what I did and
for what my father's doing now.

36:33.825 --> 36:34.993
- Ellis! No more talking!

36:35.026 --> 36:36.795
- No, I knew you--
- Order! Order!

36:36.828 --> 36:39.731
- You--you were passed out.
And I couldn't stop myself.

36:39.765 --> 36:42.234
I was--I was wrong, Janie.

36:42.268 --> 36:45.003
I was so wrong,
and I am so sorry.

36:45.036 --> 36:46.972
I raped you.

36:47.005 --> 36:49.841
And I'm just--I'm so sorry.

36:49.875 --> 36:50.942
I'm so sorry.

36:50.976 --> 36:53.879
- Everyone, my chambers. Now.

36:57.283 --> 36:59.351
- Is your client changing
his plea, Mr. D'Angelo?

36:59.385 --> 37:00.486
- No.
- You're not a part

37:00.519 --> 37:03.021
of this preceding, Mr. Griffin.
- My son wants me here.

37:03.054 --> 37:06.725
It's his right.
- No, I don't.

37:06.758 --> 37:10.028
Get out.

37:10.061 --> 37:12.498
Leave me alone.

37:15.967 --> 37:18.003
[sighs]

37:18.036 --> 37:22.541
I just--I just want this
to be over.

37:22.574 --> 37:25.344
- Are you changing your plea,
Mr. Griffin?

37:25.377 --> 37:27.946
- Can we have a few minutes,
Your Honor?

37:27.979 --> 37:29.047
- The People have no objection.

37:29.080 --> 37:32.318
- I don't need any more time.

37:32.351 --> 37:34.886
Or any more help.

37:34.920 --> 37:37.323
I just wanna plead guilty
in front of everyone.

37:37.356 --> 37:40.559
- I think you already did, son.

37:40.592 --> 37:42.961
I'm prepared to accept
a plea of guilty

37:42.994 --> 37:44.463
to rape in the second degree.

37:44.496 --> 37:46.798
We'll reconvene this afternoon.

37:50.969 --> 37:52.571
You're certain you're
making this plea

37:52.604 --> 37:55.374
freely and voluntarily?
- Yes.

37:55.407 --> 37:57.576
- Before I commence
with sentencing,

37:57.609 --> 38:00.412
I understand the victim
has a statement.

38:06.485 --> 38:10.522
- At first you didn't think
you did anything wrong.

38:10.556 --> 38:13.525
You blamed alcohol.

38:13.559 --> 38:14.893
I'm glad you now
understand

38:14.926 --> 38:18.096
alcohol didn't
push my dress up,

38:18.129 --> 38:23.034
get on top of me,
and force itself inside of me.

38:23.068 --> 38:27.339
I'm glad you know
what you did.

38:27.373 --> 38:30.909
That you said,
"I'm sorry. I raped you."

38:37.516 --> 38:41.086
I choose to put this behind me.

38:43.855 --> 38:45.891
Thank you.

38:47.393 --> 38:48.927
- Thank you.

38:48.960 --> 38:50.562
If both parties have said
all they want to say

38:50.596 --> 38:52.364
I will now impose a sentence.

38:54.866 --> 38:56.502
Mr. Griffin,
you have pled guilty

38:56.535 --> 38:59.638
to rape in the second degree.

38:59.671 --> 39:03.141
Taking your acknowledgement
of wrong-doing into account,

39:03.174 --> 39:04.976
in addition to your age

39:05.010 --> 39:07.646
and the fact that this is
your first arrest,

39:07.679 --> 39:11.149
I sentence you to
24 months in prison.

39:11.182 --> 39:12.984
Court is adjourned.
[gavel bangs]

39:13.018 --> 39:15.554
- [sobbing]

39:22.894 --> 39:24.596
all: [together]
Two years, not enough!

39:24.630 --> 39:28.634
Two years, not enough!
Two years, not enough!

39:28.667 --> 39:30.469
Two years,
not enough!

39:30.502 --> 39:32.170
Two years, not enough!

39:32.203 --> 39:35.874
- So now what?

39:35.907 --> 39:37.609
You arrest me
for witness tampering?

39:37.643 --> 39:40.912
- No. I talked to Barba.

39:40.946 --> 39:43.081
But, Patrick,
what were you thinking?

39:43.114 --> 39:45.617
- That I needed
to save my son.

39:45.651 --> 39:49.555
No matter what.
No matter how.

39:49.588 --> 39:51.523
I'm a cop.

39:51.557 --> 39:53.925
I protect people
I don't even know.

39:53.959 --> 39:56.027
And here's my son,

39:56.061 --> 39:58.063
my best friend
in the whole world,

39:58.096 --> 40:00.899
about to go down for
ten seconds of stupidity.

40:00.932 --> 40:06.071
So I thought if the jury
just heard a witness say

40:06.104 --> 40:10.609
that she was awake,
there'd be reasonable doubt.

40:10.642 --> 40:14.079
- I'm just gonna pretend
that I didn't hear any of that.

40:14.112 --> 40:16.147
- This whole system
is rigged against him.

40:16.181 --> 40:17.182
Protesters.

40:17.215 --> 40:19.985
I could see the way
the women on that jury box

40:20.018 --> 40:22.187
were looking at him.

40:22.220 --> 40:24.055
Even now,

40:24.089 --> 40:27.993
they want Ellis' head
on a platter, okay?

40:28.026 --> 40:30.095
I failed him.

40:30.128 --> 40:32.931
- You're still his father.

40:32.964 --> 40:35.133
No matter how
he feels about you,

40:35.166 --> 40:37.035
about himself,

40:37.068 --> 40:40.672
for these next two years,
be there for him.

40:40.706 --> 40:44.142
I'm sorry, Patrick.

40:44.175 --> 40:46.177
If there were something
I could have done--

40:46.211 --> 40:48.246
- There was.

40:48.279 --> 40:52.618
And you chose not to do it.

40:52.651 --> 40:56.121
I went to bat for you.

40:56.154 --> 40:59.090
- And the truth is,

40:59.124 --> 41:01.459
I wish you hadn't.

41:04.696 --> 41:07.733
I wish you would have
just told the truth.
