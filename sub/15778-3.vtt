WEBVTT

00:06.915 --> 00:08.415
You Colonel Gathers?

00:08.416 --> 00:12.519
What? No, you don't! What do you want
from me? Who sent you, you bastard?

00:12.520 --> 00:15.556
Special Agent In Training,
Brock Samson, reporting for duty.

00:15.557 --> 00:18.892
Don't you salute me! Leave
that Little John John crap back in Biloxi.

00:18.893 --> 00:20.728
- Yes, sir.
- And don't "Sir" me, damn you!

00:20.729 --> 00:24.198
You're not in the Marines any more.
This is intelligence. Start using it!

00:24.199 --> 00:26.699
OK, Colonel...

00:27.135 --> 00:30.204
Call me Hunter.
Now let me get a good look at you.

00:30.205 --> 00:32.171
God, they're making them big nowadays!

00:32.173 --> 00:36.577
Don't they know there's a gas crunch on?
Look at the size of you.

00:36.578 --> 00:39.346
Samson, Brock. Born Omaha,
Nebraska to a single mother.

00:39.347 --> 00:41.882
Half Swedish, quarter Polish,
quarter Winnebago.

00:41.883 --> 00:45.085
You lost your virginity at 14, have
one brother and you enjoy motocross.

00:45.086 --> 00:47.321
The Brock Samson
you knew and were is dead.

00:47.322 --> 00:50.557
Happy birthday, Frankenstein!
You're OSI's baby now.

00:50.558 --> 00:52.926
- Will you do whatever your country asks?
- Yes.

00:52.927 --> 00:56.830
Can you keep your head when confronted
with mind-blowing weirdness?

00:56.831 --> 00:59.900
- Are you ready for anything?
- Yes!

00:59.901 --> 01:01.802
- Are you still ready for anything?
- Ye--

01:01.803 --> 01:06.640
Wrong! Lesson number one, trust no one.
When God created the third cave man...

01:06.641 --> 01:12.379
a conspiracy was hatched
against one of them. Get up, damn you!

01:12.380 --> 01:15.582
Strap her on, kid, your training starts now.
When we're done...

01:15.583 --> 01:19.253
you'll belong in the elite agency
that's been defending this country...

01:19.254 --> 01:24.264
since the second American Revolution.
The invisible one.

01:25.193 --> 01:29.963
Welcome to the Office
of Secret Intelligence, Samson.

01:31.000 --> 01:37.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:54.722 --> 01:56.523
Shouldn't be gone too long.

01:56.524 --> 01:59.259
Compound's got a pretty good
security system...

01:59.260 --> 02:03.497
but if anyone manages to break through,
we also have a panic room.

02:03.498 --> 02:07.835
I doubt you'll need that, though.
OK, you're good. Dean?

02:07.836 --> 02:10.770
- Any questions?
- Yes, one.

02:10.805 --> 02:14.641
- What the hell are you doing?
- The monthly head lice check.

02:14.642 --> 02:18.145
Figured I'd get it out of the way,
so you don't have to worry about it.

02:18.146 --> 02:20.842
OK, you're good. Wait.

02:20.882 --> 02:25.319
OK, you boys get into your PJ's
and you come say good night.

02:25.320 --> 02:27.955
Jeez, they're gonna
be here any minute.

02:27.956 --> 02:30.224
Brock Samson.

02:30.225 --> 02:33.694
The most feared man
in espionage...a nanny?

02:33.695 --> 02:35.696
Pathetic.

02:35.697 --> 02:41.329
Brock, your talents are wasted
on these...civilians.

02:41.369 --> 02:44.204
Quit the OSI,
go freelance with me.

02:44.205 --> 02:46.373
We would make such a team.

02:46.374 --> 02:49.366
Save it, Mo, this is my job.

02:49.410 --> 02:52.246
Well, was until I got this mission.

02:52.247 --> 02:57.050
So for the next couple of days it's yours.
I'm trusting you to protect these people.

02:57.051 --> 03:00.680
From what?
Bed bugs and tummy aches?

03:00.722 --> 03:04.191
You'd be surprised
how many enemies Dr. Venture has.

03:04.192 --> 03:07.828
We get into some
pretty hot situations here.

03:07.829 --> 03:11.999
Brock, which of these looks better
the velour or the Italian knit?

03:12.000 --> 03:14.701
- Hello.
- Doc, this is Molotov Cocktease.

03:14.702 --> 03:17.771
I hired her to watch out for you guys
while I'm on assignment.

03:17.772 --> 03:19.740
Charmed.
And I got some iodine on this.

03:19.741 --> 03:23.277
Do you have time to get that out
before you go play cowboys and Indians?

03:23.278 --> 03:26.480
Say the word and he's dead.
We could be in Monaco by midnight.

03:26.481 --> 03:29.783
- Pardon?
- Doc, come here with me a second.

03:29.784 --> 03:31.718
- Did you check her references?
- Yeah.

03:31.719 --> 03:33.787
Great! She's one
of your hussies, isn't she?

03:33.788 --> 03:35.956
You're putting my life
in the hands of a hussy.

03:35.957 --> 03:38.983
She's a mercenary not a...hussy.

03:39.994 --> 03:43.224
Did you have...
relations with her?

03:44.732 --> 03:47.167
No, I didn't.

03:47.168 --> 03:49.708
Well, then Rusty calls dibs.

03:51.005 --> 03:53.674
Gosh, she must jazzercise night and day.

03:53.675 --> 03:56.175
Hi, I'm Hank.

03:57.111 --> 03:58.912
No, it's not costing you anything.

03:58.913 --> 04:02.316
What is she, an intern? She's getting
credit for this in Murder School?

04:02.317 --> 04:03.717
I worked out a trade.

04:03.718 --> 04:06.853
You know how Russians
are goofy for American jeans?

04:06.854 --> 04:13.284
Well, I snagged a planeload of them
last time we were down in Bolivia.

04:14.095 --> 04:16.595
Manaconda!

04:22.003 --> 04:24.238
All right, she's nimble,
I'll grant you that.

04:24.239 --> 04:27.679
- But can she close the deal?
- Wait.

04:34.849 --> 04:37.317
Wo-manaconda.

04:37.318 --> 04:43.058
That's me. Later, Doc. Later, boys.
You take care of them, Mo.

04:45.159 --> 04:47.861
Well, what say we get you settled in?

04:47.862 --> 04:51.865
Shall I make up the fold-out couch
in my dad's old study for you or...

04:51.866 --> 04:54.968
would you be more comfortable
in the master suite?

04:54.969 --> 04:56.503
Get something straight...

04:56.504 --> 05:01.908
I am here only as a favor to that man
whose feet you aren't even fit to kiss.

05:01.909 --> 05:05.579
I am not protecting your lives,
I am saving his.

05:05.580 --> 05:10.584
Because by the time he gets back
you will no longer need a babysitter.

05:10.585 --> 05:14.544
I'm going to turn you into men.

05:16.057 --> 05:19.826
The agency thanks you for taking
this hiatus from operation Rusty's Blanket.

05:19.827 --> 05:22.996
This is the standard Office
of Secret Intelligence field kit.

05:22.997 --> 05:25.699
There're some new additions since you
were last briefed...

05:25.700 --> 05:28.068
so take a moment
to familiarize yourself with...

05:28.069 --> 05:31.527
Gay, gay, useless, never use them...

05:31.572 --> 05:35.909
Smokes. These I can use!
Do they do anything stupid?

05:35.910 --> 05:39.413
Well, the filters each house
a tiny, state of the art...

05:39.414 --> 05:43.016
At least take the pen. You never know
when you might need a pen.

05:43.017 --> 05:46.553
Or is it?
Go ahead, ask me what it does.

05:46.554 --> 05:49.054
This is my field kit.

05:50.158 --> 05:52.225
- This the client?
- Yes, sir.

05:52.226 --> 05:53.894
Rogue agent. One of our own.

05:53.895 --> 05:56.229
- Hunter!
- Did you know him?

05:56.230 --> 05:59.700
He was the second-closest thing
to a father I ever had.

05:59.701 --> 06:01.935
Bummer!
'Cause we need him dead.

06:01.936 --> 06:03.770
48 hours ago he went A.W.O.L...

06:03.771 --> 06:07.274
with 40 mill of the agency's money
and a head full of national secrets.

06:07.275 --> 06:10.610
He was spotted in Geneva but
he vanished before we could bring him in.

06:10.611 --> 06:14.114
Not before he kidnapped
the enemy's top plastic surgeon though.

06:14.115 --> 06:17.851
- So how do I find him?
- Captain Swallow will brief you from here.

06:17.852 --> 06:24.122
It's been a real pleasure meeting you,
Mr. Samson. Good luck to you.

06:40.074 --> 06:43.110
Can't swim, my ass!
You're from the country, damn you!

06:43.111 --> 06:46.871
You just haven't been
properly motivated.

07:02.830 --> 07:06.459
Yes. Yes. Yes, do it.
Do it, boy!

07:07.969 --> 07:11.489
Goddammit, you are ready for the field!

07:11.773 --> 07:14.273
Stand down, stand down.

07:17.979 --> 07:20.280
Stop and think!
Stop and think!

07:20.281 --> 07:24.191
If I was the enemy
you'd be dead already!

07:29.056 --> 07:31.658
Macronesia, this is where
we lost the signal...

07:31.659 --> 07:34.127
from the hostage's
subcutaneous homing chip.

07:34.128 --> 07:37.364
Our guess is Colonel Gathers
is still somewhere in that vicinity.

07:37.365 --> 07:39.599
We need to find him
and take him out quickly.

07:39.600 --> 07:42.869
Before he has time to change
his identity and disappear forever.

07:42.870 --> 07:45.539
- How was the lobster?
- Excellent.

07:45.540 --> 07:49.176
But Macronesia's
three days away by sub.

07:49.177 --> 07:52.271
- What is this, a '59?
- '58.

07:52.313 --> 07:55.916
- How are we gonna get there in time?
- Not we, you.

07:55.917 --> 07:57.784
And not via submarine.

07:57.785 --> 07:59.719
Via this.

07:59.720 --> 08:01.955
Dragon, eagle, mantis...

08:01.956 --> 08:07.496
monkey, tiger, snake, leopard.
These are called "the maimers."

08:09.764 --> 08:16.069
Strike at your enemy with one of these,
and they will be your enemy no more.

08:16.070 --> 08:17.404
This is called binding.

08:17.405 --> 08:20.607
With my opponent in this hold
I can have my way with him.

08:20.608 --> 08:23.108
Now...spar!

08:26.581 --> 08:29.316
It works!
I never used to beat Hank!

08:29.317 --> 08:32.480
Who da master?!
Who da master?!

08:32.520 --> 08:35.688
Focus, Hank, your opponent
has you on your back.

08:35.690 --> 08:38.409
Are you going to let him win?

08:41.996 --> 08:44.931
- Sho' nuff!
- Nyet, Hank! Nyet!

08:44.932 --> 08:51.712
Your improvisation was excellent,
but we're not up to weapons training yet.

08:53.674 --> 08:55.742
Holy crap, you made me kill Dean!

08:55.743 --> 09:00.533
Sudden drop in blood pressure,
he's only passed out.

09:01.048 --> 09:04.778
Well, what are you waiting for?
Pin him!

09:07.922 --> 09:10.891
- Yeah?
- Samson, we have a problem.

09:10.892 --> 09:13.827
I'm kind of in the middle
of something here, Mo.

09:13.828 --> 09:16.263
What's the deal?
You should be able to handle them.

09:16.264 --> 09:18.265
Please, of course I did.

09:18.266 --> 09:21.067
But you neglected
to tell me this compound...

09:21.068 --> 09:25.088
is built on top
of an Indian burial ground!

09:26.974 --> 09:30.710
Crap! Is it the anniversary
again already?

09:30.711 --> 09:34.681
All right, look, you wanna call Dr. Orpheus,
he's a necromancer...

09:34.682 --> 09:38.919
he's right over in the east wing.
He'll clear that right up, no problem.

09:38.920 --> 09:40.320
Look, I gotta go.

09:40.321 --> 09:46.091
You gotta keep this channel clear
unless it's a real emergency.

10:00.441 --> 10:03.643
Normally I just come over
and take care of this on the 25th...

10:03.644 --> 10:07.981
but I forgot this was a leap year,
and, well, the Apaches didn't have those.

10:07.982 --> 10:11.751
So easy to lose track of matters
temporal in my vocation.

10:11.752 --> 10:13.887
My apologies
for the error, Miss...

10:13.888 --> 10:16.022
Cocktease.

10:16.023 --> 10:18.959
- Of course. How do you do?
- Thanks for coming, Dr. O.

10:18.960 --> 10:22.429
- Too bad you can't stay longer.
- I don't really have to be anywhere.

10:22.430 --> 10:24.930
I said, good day, sir.

10:25.766 --> 10:29.302
Well, after that rigmarole
I could use a night cap.

10:29.303 --> 10:31.504
Care to join me?
I've been squirreling away...

10:31.505 --> 10:35.108
a bottle of cooking sherry
for a special occasion, but...

10:35.109 --> 10:39.212
well, heck,
this is cause enough for celebra--

10:39.213 --> 10:40.981
Some, other time then.

10:40.982 --> 10:45.692
No, no, it sounds delightful!
I'll get the glasses.

11:04.939 --> 11:07.689
However will we pass the time?

11:20.121 --> 11:22.522
What are you doing
with Danica Patrick?

11:22.523 --> 11:25.859
- I'm over her. You want this?
- Nah, not my type.

11:25.860 --> 11:28.900
Wanna keep the Fun-Tak, at least?

11:30.865 --> 11:33.733
Not Mary Lou Retton too?
What's going on with you?

11:33.734 --> 11:37.637
Dean, Dean, I sometimes forget
you're younger than me.

11:37.638 --> 11:39.472
By a lousy four minutes!

11:39.473 --> 11:42.175
Well, then maybe in four minutes
you'll understand.

11:42.176 --> 11:45.578
It took a real woman
to finally show me that these girls...

11:45.579 --> 11:49.849
fine athletes and easy on the eye both,
were but the mere crushes of a boy.

11:49.850 --> 11:53.790
And you, my friend, are looking at...a man.

11:54.689 --> 11:56.423
You've finally got 'em?

11:56.424 --> 12:00.684
A gentleman never asks
and a lady never tells.

12:08.636 --> 12:11.416
Morning, Molotov! I made you...

12:11.672 --> 12:15.902
Hank, you shouldn't
sneak up on me like that.

12:16.844 --> 12:18.978
Venture residence,
Hank speaking.

12:18.979 --> 12:23.450
- Hank, hey pal, I forgot to tell you...
- Is that Brock? Let me speak to him.

12:23.451 --> 12:25.585
Samson, where are you?

12:25.586 --> 12:27.887
Come on, Mo,
you know I can't tell you that.

12:27.888 --> 12:31.424
So you do remember how to be a spy.
When are you coming back?

12:31.425 --> 12:35.028
- Why, you miss me?
- I miss the man you used to be.

12:35.029 --> 12:37.097
Perhaps you'll find him on this mission.

12:37.098 --> 12:40.400
There you are. Listen,
today's the day I do my marketing...

12:40.401 --> 12:41.434
Is that Brock?

12:41.435 --> 12:45.705
Checking up on us? Well, don't you worry
your pretty blond head about me.

12:45.706 --> 12:49.809
While you're on your little vacation,
me and my hotshot new bodyguard...

12:49.810 --> 12:52.612
will be skipping down
to the Bohacks, thank you.

12:52.613 --> 12:55.582
- Why's my brother dressed like that?
- I didn't ask.

12:55.583 --> 12:59.853
I thought you two just liked
to dress like idiots.

12:59.854 --> 13:01.855
And don't tell Orpheus but I...

13:01.856 --> 13:05.158
"borrowed" his Sunday paper,
which means, that's right...

13:05.159 --> 13:07.659
a double coupon. Hank!

13:19.907 --> 13:21.908
When do we get to do something?

13:21.909 --> 13:24.911
Stakeouts are 80% of the job.
Don't pull at that!

13:24.912 --> 13:28.352
A convincing cover
is the other 20% .

13:29.250 --> 13:31.651
So, no women, no children...

13:31.652 --> 13:33.953
No women, no children.
Them's the rules.

13:33.954 --> 13:37.524
- Separates us from the baddies.
- What if she's an enemy agent?

13:37.525 --> 13:39.926
- An assassin?
- No.

13:39.927 --> 13:43.029
A double-agent assassin
who just killed the President?

13:43.030 --> 13:45.098
No, sir.
Non-lethal takedown only.

13:45.099 --> 13:48.802
President's not the President
anyway, you know that.

13:48.803 --> 13:52.238
How about, you know...
A lady Dracula?

13:52.239 --> 13:55.106
You mean, Le Vampyr?
Nosferatu?

13:55.142 --> 13:57.076
- Yes.
- Undead.

13:57.077 --> 14:02.248
Not technically a woman in that regard,
so you got no beef there. Also, fictitious.

14:02.249 --> 14:05.789
- Do not eat that, it's C-4!
- Woman!

14:06.720 --> 14:08.922
50 laps. No lunch until you're through.

14:08.923 --> 14:12.258
- Yes, ma'am.
- I thought I was excused.

14:12.259 --> 14:14.627
Your foot does not excuse you
from training.

14:14.628 --> 14:16.830
Everything through chapter four by noon.

14:16.831 --> 14:19.331
That's one!

14:24.238 --> 14:26.940
Dr. Venture, I didn't realize.

14:26.941 --> 14:29.075
No, no, it's...fine.

14:29.076 --> 14:31.878
I was thinking of painting
an accent wall there anyway.

14:31.879 --> 14:34.047
You know, jazz up
the rumpus room a bit.

14:34.048 --> 14:37.168
You're bleeding.
Let me help you.

14:41.188 --> 14:42.388
Twelve!

14:42.389 --> 14:45.409
- Hey, Dean.
- Triana! Thank God!

14:47.761 --> 14:49.963
- Nice bod.
- Thanks.

14:49.964 --> 14:52.762
I've been working out. A lot.

14:52.800 --> 14:54.934
We came over to use
the pool, is that cool?

14:54.935 --> 14:58.427
No, it's not cool.
Nothing is cool.

15:00.374 --> 15:03.343
You seem a little weird.
Are you guys OK?

15:03.344 --> 15:05.844
She's killing us!

15:05.846 --> 15:08.314
Listen, we kinda got off
on the wrong foot, you and I.

15:08.315 --> 15:11.618
And I don't mean the one you just kicked
my teeth in with, I mean earlier.

15:11.619 --> 15:15.188
So fine, if you're not interested
in the 1 35 pounds...

15:15.189 --> 15:18.458
of grade A American come-and-get-it,
I can respect that.

15:18.459 --> 15:21.986
But...we can at least be friends.

15:22.029 --> 15:24.529
Right?

15:34.541 --> 15:39.103
So...tell me, friend,
you might know this...

15:39.146 --> 15:43.149
the whole Russian mail order bride deal
on the internet, is that on the up-and-up?

15:43.150 --> 15:44.450
I wouldn't know.

15:44.451 --> 15:46.920
Because those Chinese ones
are a real racket.

15:46.921 --> 15:49.889
The damn thing was already dead
when the crate finally showed up.

15:49.890 --> 15:52.458
And Hank,
I don't know what his deal is.

15:52.459 --> 15:54.560
It's like he's actually enjoying this.

15:54.561 --> 15:59.931
- The Scooby-Doo kid? Where'd he go?
- He's swimming laps.

16:04.405 --> 16:08.041
Would you mind? I only allow Brock
to smoke outside or in the hangar.

16:08.042 --> 16:10.376
Allow him?!

16:10.377 --> 16:13.079
You do not allow Brock Samson
to do anything.

16:13.080 --> 16:15.214
He allows you to live.

16:15.215 --> 16:21.035
And every day that he does so,
you should bow down and thank...

16:24.391 --> 16:26.292
Nyet!

16:26.293 --> 16:28.887
- Milk breath.
- Incredible.

16:28.929 --> 16:32.899
Hank, we've got big troubles.
The Apaches are back!

16:32.900 --> 16:34.267
- What?
- Look.

16:34.268 --> 16:36.768
Teepee in your trunks.

16:39.139 --> 16:43.109
My pants are haunted!
My pants are haunted!

16:47.348 --> 16:52.298
It's time. You better skedaddle,
this might get hairy.

16:55.990 --> 16:57.523
No women, no children.

16:57.524 --> 17:00.049
So, you have turned.

17:12.239 --> 17:15.367
Hello? Miss Cocktease?

17:16.676 --> 17:19.176
Anyone?

17:21.781 --> 17:24.422
I can't believe you kept it.

17:38.165 --> 17:40.805
I like it with the boots on.

17:44.605 --> 17:47.105
You Cockease!

17:50.444 --> 17:53.274
Does it hurt, my little Samson?

17:53.280 --> 17:55.942
Let mama kiss it better.

18:02.356 --> 18:04.856
Incredible.

18:08.162 --> 18:10.662
Incredible!

18:12.666 --> 18:14.667
Wait!

18:14.668 --> 18:17.168
She took the cigarettes!

18:41.995 --> 18:44.497
- Do you want me, Hank?
- Yes, sir.

18:44.498 --> 18:47.800
Your father will never let us be together.

18:47.801 --> 18:51.404
He's a big old doody-head
who wants me all to himself.

18:51.405 --> 18:55.364
- He's a jerk.
- Yes, Hank, he is.

18:55.409 --> 18:59.106
But what are you going
to do about it?

18:59.146 --> 19:02.748
Kill pop. Kill pop. Kill pop.
You should kill pop.

19:02.749 --> 19:04.517
It's the only way.

19:04.518 --> 19:07.351
It's the only way. Kill pop.

19:07.387 --> 19:11.167
We should kill pop.
It's the only...way.

19:35.949 --> 19:37.850
- Father?
- Yes, Hank?

19:37.851 --> 19:39.585
I want to kill you.

19:39.586 --> 19:45.596
That's nice. Play pirates somewhere else,
boy, your father's busy.

19:52.432 --> 19:54.400
Hank, nyet!

19:54.401 --> 19:56.869
Please! Don't!

19:56.870 --> 20:00.829
Molotov... I want to..

20:00.874 --> 20:03.374
Come on, baby!

20:09.883 --> 20:13.886
Back. I don't have orders to kill you
but I will if you get in my way.

20:13.887 --> 20:17.456
Please. The Colonel
gave me a message for you.

20:17.457 --> 20:20.693
"Brock, I knew they'd send you.
After 40 years..."

20:20.694 --> 20:24.297
After 40 years,
I'm finally tired of the game.

20:24.298 --> 20:28.367
The years of secrets and lies, of living
with constant danger of being exposed.

20:28.368 --> 20:30.570
I know you'll understand, Brock.

20:30.571 --> 20:33.404
"I know you'll understand."

20:33.440 --> 20:36.442
I have my orders.
He'd understand that.

20:36.443 --> 20:39.742
Please, let him have his peace.

20:39.780 --> 20:42.280
I intend to.

20:42.316 --> 20:45.017
What the....
What the hell did you do to him?

20:45.018 --> 20:47.019
Only what she asked me to do.

20:47.020 --> 20:49.155
This man was like a father to me.

20:49.156 --> 20:53.459
Well, think of this woman
like a mother to you.

20:53.460 --> 20:56.122
Your father. Your mother.

20:56.163 --> 20:59.132
Your father...
Your mother...

20:59.700 --> 21:02.200
He's your mother.

21:06.840 --> 21:09.340
No women, no children!

21:13.280 --> 21:16.160
I'll see you around old friend.

21:17.317 --> 21:22.017
That took a lot out of me.
You're going to be OK?

21:22.589 --> 21:25.089
OK. Had to be sure.

21:55.322 --> 21:56.889
All set.

21:56.890 --> 22:00.860
You can't tell me
you don't miss the action, the danger.

22:00.861 --> 22:03.262
The moral ambiguity,
the weirdness.

22:03.263 --> 22:05.531
Yet you choose to live here.

22:05.532 --> 22:08.868
Last chance, Samson.
What's your answer?

22:08.869 --> 22:11.304
Sorry, Mol, but...

22:11.305 --> 22:13.805
go Team Venture.

22:13.874 --> 22:15.207
Bye.

22:15.208 --> 22:17.310
- Where's Hank?
- Up in his room.

22:17.311 --> 22:19.879
- Our little man is grounded.
- What'd he do?

22:19.880 --> 22:22.882
Get this, I'm working in the lab,
and Hank sleepwalks in...

22:22.883 --> 22:26.085
hauls off and smacks me
in the head with a papier mâché sword...

22:26.086 --> 22:28.287
pees his pants and passes out.

22:28.288 --> 22:33.021
- So, I didn't miss much?
- What's there to miss?

22:33.060 --> 22:36.029
Ca, c'est de la bonne soupe.
