WEBVTT

00:03.000 --> 00:04.667
(Ryan) Previously, on Mech-X4...

00:04.750 --> 00:06.875
So you're saying
the military is moving the ooze.

00:06.959 --> 00:09.125
-Grey?
-Back from the dead!

00:09.208 --> 00:11.208
(growling)

00:11.291 --> 00:13.208
(Harris) We work together when we have to.

00:13.291 --> 00:14.333
We're frenemies.

00:14.417 --> 00:15.500
-No.
-Weird way to put it.

00:15.583 --> 00:17.417
Whatever you're doing, it stops now.

00:17.500 --> 00:18.959
(Grey) You're too late!

00:19.041 --> 00:20.166
(explosion)

00:20.250 --> 00:23.875
(Traeger) You will address me as Traeger.

00:23.959 --> 00:28.083
(Harris) Power ratings are off the chart.
I have no idea how to stop him.

00:28.583 --> 00:30.959
We could've won this battle
if I had two good arms.

00:31.041 --> 00:32.458
But I know what we can do.

00:32.542 --> 00:35.417
I found the plane Grey and Traeger stole.
They're in the Arctic.

00:35.500 --> 00:37.834
-You and I, we've been rivals since...
-Kindergarten.

00:37.917 --> 00:40.375
-Do it.
-Who are you talking to?

00:41.166 --> 00:42.291
(loud thud)

00:43.750 --> 00:46.250
Welcome to Mech-X4.

00:46.834 --> 00:47.667
No way.

00:48.750 --> 00:51.667
(ominous music playing)

00:54.792 --> 00:55.917
(computer beeping)

01:04.583 --> 01:08.208
(footsteps approaching)

01:24.166 --> 01:27.000
(jet swooshes)

01:33.834 --> 01:38.041
(theme music playing)

02:12.917 --> 02:14.333
(Harris) Thanks for the ride, sis.

02:14.417 --> 02:17.041
Yeah, well,
I couldn't let you limp to the library.

02:17.792 --> 02:19.834
Yeah... if Mom and Dad wonder where I am,

02:19.917 --> 02:21.083
-Mm-hm?
-Spyder's failing,

02:21.166 --> 02:22.417
well, everything.

02:22.500 --> 02:24.417
I promised I'd spend the weekend
tutoring him.

02:24.500 --> 02:26.792
We both know that kid's untutorable.

02:26.875 --> 02:28.125
So, uh...

02:28.667 --> 02:30.750
Do you have another story
I can tell Mom and Dad?

02:31.667 --> 02:34.667
We're off to save the world
from a supervillain?

02:34.750 --> 02:38.250
Don't worry. I'll come up with something
much more believable than that.

02:39.834 --> 02:44.208
Look. Just... be safe, okay?

02:46.375 --> 02:47.959
Get outta here.

02:57.500 --> 02:58.917
Your sister seems nice.

03:00.291 --> 03:02.709
Try sharing a bathroom with her
and three older sisters.

03:03.166 --> 03:05.709
So... what about you?
Everything taken care of?

03:05.792 --> 03:11.291
Yeah, I got Olivia to take care
of my gerbil, my hamster, my rescue Lhasa,

03:11.375 --> 03:13.667
my goldfish and my bonsai tree.

03:13.750 --> 03:16.375
So, if half of them aren't deceased
by the time I get back,

03:16.458 --> 03:17.542
I will take that as a win.

03:17.625 --> 03:20.208
No. What did you tell your dads?

03:22.959 --> 03:24.000
I have to make a call.

03:24.583 --> 03:25.709
Come on.

03:30.250 --> 03:32.333
There you go. Thanks so much.

03:33.917 --> 03:36.583
-Hey, you ready?
-Yeah. What about you?

03:36.667 --> 03:38.458
You got your cover story straight for Mom?

03:38.542 --> 03:41.041
I'm supposed to be going with Harris
to some academic bowl,

03:41.125 --> 03:43.000
-and I'll be his emotional support.
-Right.

03:43.083 --> 03:45.917
And I'm going to a video game convention
with Georgia and her family.

03:46.000 --> 03:48.625
(Mark) I gotta stop talking.
I don't wanna smudge the fake scar.

03:48.709 --> 03:52.291
Are you wearing that little costume
that your girlfriend made you wear?

03:53.834 --> 03:54.917
It's a warrior's outfit.

03:55.000 --> 03:56.750
-Uh-huh.
-Yes.

03:56.834 --> 03:58.917
(laughing)

03:59.000 --> 04:01.417
But, it's the perfect cover story.

04:01.500 --> 04:03.917
All right, I'm only gonna be
at the convention for one day,

04:04.000 --> 04:06.667
Mom thinks I'll be here for three,
so I'm covered next two days.

04:06.750 --> 04:09.041
All right, and then we'll take Mech-X4
up to the Arctic,

04:09.125 --> 04:11.083
we'll take on Traeger,
and destroy the weapon,

04:11.166 --> 04:13.458
and then we'll be back
before anybody else misses us.

04:13.542 --> 04:15.375
Look at you, mighty warrior.

04:15.458 --> 04:16.333
I gotta go.

04:16.959 --> 04:18.750
(imitates whip)

04:19.291 --> 04:20.333
-Hey.
-Hey.

04:21.250 --> 04:24.375
So... you ready
to be my damsel in distress?

04:25.291 --> 04:27.291
Wait... Wai... Wait... what?

04:27.375 --> 04:29.625
I thought I was gonna be
your knight in shining armor?

04:29.709 --> 04:32.959
(laughs)
You have so much to learn.

04:34.125 --> 04:35.041
Okay.

04:35.542 --> 04:37.166
Just follow my lead.

04:37.250 --> 04:39.959
You'll get it
before next year's convention.

04:40.792 --> 04:41.750
Sure.

04:42.333 --> 04:43.500
All the time in the world.

04:45.041 --> 04:46.709
Is everything okay?

04:46.792 --> 04:51.834
Uh... Yeah. I just have this...
big test after the convention.

04:51.917 --> 04:53.333
Hopefully I'll get through it.

04:54.500 --> 04:55.917
I'm sure you'll kill it.

04:57.250 --> 04:58.291
I hope so.

05:01.125 --> 05:02.750
Ryan?

05:02.834 --> 05:05.291
I want you and your brother to know,
that I'm onto you.

05:05.375 --> 05:07.458
And I know you think you're fooling me,

05:07.542 --> 05:12.041
but I do not want a birthday gift
this year, okay?

05:12.125 --> 05:14.250
Every year you guys fight about the gift,

05:14.333 --> 05:16.083
and it always ruins my birthday dinner.

05:16.166 --> 05:17.917
What do you mean?

05:18.709 --> 05:23.000
(yelling)

05:23.959 --> 05:25.333
(glass breaking)

05:27.625 --> 05:28.959
(glass clinks)

05:32.041 --> 05:34.125
-(yelling)
-You should know that...

05:34.208 --> 05:35.792
I'm judging you right now.

05:39.417 --> 05:43.166
(laughs)
It's a photo locket.

05:43.750 --> 05:46.583
With no photo in it.

05:47.667 --> 05:49.208
You were supposed to put the photo.

05:49.291 --> 05:52.083
I got the locket, you were in charge
of the photo, buttknuckle!

05:52.166 --> 05:53.166
Dipwad!

05:54.792 --> 05:56.625
Just, let it happen, Grace.

05:58.250 --> 06:00.875
Aaah! Let. Me. Go!

06:00.959 --> 06:03.458
(lights buzzing)

06:03.542 --> 06:04.500
(screams)

06:04.583 --> 06:08.500
(groaning)

06:08.583 --> 06:11.583
(panting)

06:11.667 --> 06:13.000
Oh! Aah!

06:13.083 --> 06:14.458
(sighs)

06:17.792 --> 06:18.834
(sighs)

06:18.917 --> 06:20.250
Uhh...

06:21.125 --> 06:24.583
-Happy birthday...
-Happy birthday, Mom.

06:25.166 --> 06:27.959
So I already told your brother,
and now I'm telling you.

06:28.041 --> 06:28.959
No gifts.

06:29.041 --> 06:31.125
I don't think fire department
will let us, anyway.

06:31.208 --> 06:33.166
(laughs)

06:35.208 --> 06:36.083
Are you okay, honey?

06:37.125 --> 06:39.542
Yeah. I just have a big project
I have to finish.

06:39.625 --> 06:41.667
-It better not be a gift.
-It's not a gift.

06:41.750 --> 06:43.041
I heard you.

06:44.000 --> 06:45.625
A nice, quiet dinner together.

06:45.709 --> 06:47.291
When we get back.

06:47.375 --> 06:48.208
Okay.

06:50.458 --> 06:52.000
Come here. I love you.

06:56.333 --> 06:57.375
Okay. Love you too, Mom.

06:57.458 --> 06:58.417
I'll see you later.

07:16.000 --> 07:19.125
(hissing)

07:23.250 --> 07:28.333
(Mark/Spyder laughing)

07:29.875 --> 07:32.166
-Wow.
-Are you selling insurance now?

07:32.250 --> 07:34.291
I just got bar mitzvahed.

07:34.375 --> 07:38.917
So if I do in battle today... I die a man.

07:39.041 --> 07:41.625
That's a little morbid, but respectable.

07:41.709 --> 07:43.333
Glad you're not wearin' a man bun.

07:43.375 --> 07:44.875
Oh, I shoulda done that.

07:44.959 --> 07:48.000
Anyway, what's um, what's your excuse?

07:48.083 --> 07:50.333
I came right from the Wyvern convention
with Georgia.

07:50.417 --> 07:51.542
It was actually pretty fun.

07:51.625 --> 07:53.333
Oh, man, she broke you.

07:54.041 --> 07:55.291
Have you ever kissed a girl?

07:58.917 --> 07:59.959
Uh, we ready?

08:00.041 --> 08:00.959
Yeah.

08:01.041 --> 08:04.750
-You got me a gift, you shouldn't have.
-No, it's not for you. It's for my mom.

08:04.834 --> 08:07.583
-I'm gonna surprise he after we get back.
-That's thoughtful.

08:07.667 --> 08:09.792
Mom specifically said no gifts.

08:09.875 --> 08:12.083
You bought that? And I bought this.

08:13.208 --> 08:16.959
-What's in it?
-Something from the best son, ever.

08:22.041 --> 08:23.625
We're not done talkin' about this.

08:23.709 --> 08:25.208
Mech-Execute!

08:28.750 --> 08:32.250
(engines roaring)

08:35.542 --> 08:37.291
The jet's locked in and we're good to go.

08:41.542 --> 08:42.375
Status?

08:42.458 --> 08:44.250
Jet thrusters to maximum.

08:44.333 --> 08:45.875
Shields operational.

08:45.959 --> 08:47.792
And, uh, weapons at a hundred percent.

08:47.875 --> 08:50.375
All systems stable,
you backstabbing, gift-getting weasel.

08:51.333 --> 08:52.917
Traeger has no idea that we're coming.

08:53.000 --> 08:54.625
We have the element of surprise.

08:54.709 --> 08:57.000
Today's the day that we finish this.

08:57.083 --> 08:59.250
Here's another surprise for Traeger:

08:59.333 --> 09:03.250
He's not fighting a boy today.
He's fighting a man.

09:05.667 --> 09:06.709
Ooh.

09:07.667 --> 09:09.291
How can you guys be so calm?

09:09.375 --> 09:12.875
Oh, don't be fooled.
Ryan masks his fear with his confidence,

09:12.959 --> 09:14.375
Harris with his science babble,

09:14.458 --> 09:17.250
Mark with his ego,
and, uh, me with my jokes.

09:18.083 --> 09:19.792
Come on, guys, we're fighting Traeger.

09:19.875 --> 09:21.333
There's a diaper under this suit.

09:21.417 --> 09:22.750
We're all secretly terrified.

09:26.333 --> 09:29.792
Harris, I just gave you the best set-up
for a joke ever. What's up?

09:30.417 --> 09:33.208
Oh, sorry. Checking satellites.

09:33.291 --> 09:35.250
(beeping)

09:35.333 --> 09:38.291
I can see the tech he stole,
but, still no sign of Grey or Traeger.

09:38.959 --> 09:40.500
This is gonna be cake, y'all.

09:40.583 --> 09:44.125
And if it's not,
at least we'll go down doing what we love.

09:44.208 --> 09:47.333
-Screaming?
-Here a couple days, you already know me.

09:54.875 --> 09:56.333
We're getting close to the Arctic.

10:03.208 --> 10:04.583
All right, we're almost there.

10:15.375 --> 10:17.291
(swooshes)

10:20.333 --> 10:21.750
He knew we were coming?

10:21.834 --> 10:24.375
-How?
-It doesn't matter.

10:24.458 --> 10:25.750
Incoming!

10:27.834 --> 10:29.041
(growling)

10:35.750 --> 10:37.333
Ow!

10:39.208 --> 10:42.291
I'm sorry. I... couldn't stop 'em all.

10:43.250 --> 10:47.333
I am making a note of the date and time,
Veracity Campbell said "sorry."

10:48.667 --> 10:50.333
No way this was gonna be easy.

10:52.041 --> 10:55.000
We're not gonna get a shot at that weapon
unless he gets off our backs.

10:55.083 --> 10:57.834
Spyder? Harris? Let's see
what this flight mode can really do.

11:02.834 --> 11:04.000
(missiles firing)

11:07.792 --> 11:08.709
Woo!

11:08.792 --> 11:10.750
Ha! He didn't expect us to fly.

11:10.834 --> 11:12.583
We have an advantage. We should push it.

11:12.667 --> 11:14.542
-Let's finish--
-Let's finish this.

11:14.625 --> 11:15.583
What?

11:16.500 --> 11:17.959
I didn't... Okay. I didn't... I...

11:18.041 --> 11:20.542
Ryan likes to say that stuff.

11:21.041 --> 11:21.875
Got it.

11:29.417 --> 11:30.542
Aah!
(grunts)

11:32.208 --> 11:34.125
-Ooh, we're takin' hits.
-From where?

11:34.208 --> 11:35.250
Where did he go?

11:37.333 --> 11:39.417
We lost the scanners on the first attack.

11:39.500 --> 11:43.041
Hey! That cloud
kinda looks like Harris' dad.

11:43.125 --> 11:44.834
It does not.

11:44.917 --> 11:49.458
Oh. Wait. It kinda does, it's...
even cold and withholding, like him.

11:49.542 --> 11:50.834
(Harris) What's that, Dad?

11:50.917 --> 11:53.917
I'm up here, just saving the world,
and what are you doing?

11:54.000 --> 11:55.750
Still working at the American Wheat Lobby?

11:55.834 --> 11:57.834
You guys seriously just chat
during battles?

11:57.917 --> 11:59.417
How are you still alive?

11:59.500 --> 12:00.667
You'll get it eventually.

12:01.709 --> 12:04.291
(explosion)

12:04.375 --> 12:05.500
(grunts)

12:06.417 --> 12:08.458
How come he can hit us
but we can't find him?

12:08.542 --> 12:10.208
Maybe he can smell Spyder's underwear.

12:10.291 --> 12:13.083
It's possible,
we do not know the extent of his powers.

12:13.166 --> 12:15.583
Guys, come on,
I need a way to find this thing.

12:15.667 --> 12:18.125
-Scanners aren't picking him up.
-We can release drones

12:18.208 --> 12:19.750
and spread them all over the clouds.

12:19.834 --> 12:23.083
Then we can program it to send out pulses
that can hit the monster...

12:23.166 --> 12:25.458
And reflect the signal
back to the robot like sonar.

12:25.542 --> 12:26.959
-Bam!
-We'll find him!

12:27.041 --> 12:28.709
-Ha!
-(both) Science!

12:28.792 --> 12:31.875
Must be hard for you two
to be this far away.

12:31.959 --> 12:34.709
Guys texting each other emojis,
what color heart are you on?

12:34.792 --> 12:36.750
-Dude!
-Unbelievable.

12:37.667 --> 12:39.333
(computer) Releasing the drones.

12:42.792 --> 12:44.667
(beeping)

12:46.458 --> 12:48.166
We're sending out the pulses and...

12:49.041 --> 12:51.500
(beeping)

12:51.583 --> 12:52.542
Got him!

12:52.625 --> 12:55.333
His bearing is two-three-four,
mark two-seven-nine.

12:58.208 --> 13:00.125
Right, uh, totally.

13:01.458 --> 13:02.333
It means below us.

13:04.917 --> 13:06.750
And he doesn't see us.

13:09.208 --> 13:10.208
(grunts)

13:17.625 --> 13:19.250
(grunts)

13:22.125 --> 13:23.959
I can't hold on much longer!

13:24.041 --> 13:24.875
Fire everything!

13:26.542 --> 13:27.834
Dude, pull up!

13:28.583 --> 13:30.208
(growling)

13:31.583 --> 13:33.417
Impact in 30 seconds!

13:33.500 --> 13:35.458
Just enough time to tell me
what you got Mom.

13:35.542 --> 13:37.041
Seriously? Now?

13:37.125 --> 13:38.000
I'm not telling you!

13:38.083 --> 13:39.333
I've got an idea for a gift,

13:39.417 --> 13:41.250
I just wanna make sure
it's as good as yours.

13:41.333 --> 13:43.625
If it's the same
as my "welcome to the robot" gift,

13:43.709 --> 13:46.500
which was an autographed photo of you,
then no!

13:47.667 --> 13:49.208
See, now you're doing it.

13:49.291 --> 13:51.166
Oh, jeez.
You're right, it... it's contagious,

13:51.250 --> 13:53.250
now I'm cracking jokes
as I'm about to die.

13:53.333 --> 13:56.625
You're not gonna die. Harris! Now!

13:56.709 --> 13:57.583
(grunts)

14:04.125 --> 14:06.583
Yeah! Woo! See, that's how you do that!

14:06.667 --> 14:07.792
(laughs)

14:07.875 --> 14:10.083
Pardon me, sir,
did somebody order a smackdown?

14:10.166 --> 14:11.208
Because it's been brung!

14:11.291 --> 14:14.417
Take that, you cherry-flavored
weird-toothed, iguana-wanna-be,

14:14.500 --> 14:16.959
let's dance on his corpse!
(giggles)

14:17.041 --> 14:18.208
Huh?

14:20.125 --> 14:21.125
Is it too much?

14:22.000 --> 14:25.625
(growling)

14:25.709 --> 14:28.834
Guys... look, it... it's still moving.

14:30.917 --> 14:34.500
(growling)

14:34.583 --> 14:36.458
He's going for the prism weapon!

14:36.542 --> 14:39.250
Look how weak he is.
This is our chance to take him out!

14:39.333 --> 14:40.875
-What do we hit him with?
-X-weapon?

14:40.959 --> 14:42.083
X-weapon!

14:48.000 --> 14:49.583
(whirring)

14:53.625 --> 14:55.125
-At the same time?
-When he says...

14:55.208 --> 14:57.208
Mech-Execute!

14:59.583 --> 15:00.792
(growls)

15:19.125 --> 15:20.500
Shut it down! Now!

15:20.583 --> 15:22.208
(screams)

15:26.667 --> 15:27.875
It worked.

15:27.959 --> 15:30.917
And now I don't need them alive anymore.

15:41.125 --> 15:42.417
He wanted us to come here.

15:42.500 --> 15:45.667
He tricked us into using the X-weapon
to cook that ocean of ooze.

15:45.750 --> 15:48.208
That explains
why he never made a move on us,

15:48.291 --> 15:49.709
even though Grey knew who we were.

15:49.792 --> 15:51.500
He needed us alive. To fire the X-weapon!

15:51.583 --> 15:52.917
We're in way over our heads.

15:53.000 --> 15:54.792
Harris is about five inches shorter
than me.

15:54.875 --> 15:56.875
-This is no time for banter.
-Sorry.

15:56.959 --> 15:58.417
-(explosions)
-(shouts)

15:58.500 --> 15:59.709
Aah!

16:02.125 --> 16:03.417
(grunts)

16:06.417 --> 16:08.041
My missiles are doing nothing!

16:09.166 --> 16:10.000
Arm cannon!

16:17.333 --> 16:18.500
(growls)

16:18.583 --> 16:19.834
-(explosion)
-(shouts)

16:19.917 --> 16:21.500
(shouts)

16:23.041 --> 16:24.250
(growling)

16:25.625 --> 16:27.583
(roaring)

16:29.000 --> 16:29.834
Ryan!

16:29.917 --> 16:32.333
(alarm beeping)

16:32.417 --> 16:33.458
Ryan, the arm's gone.

16:33.542 --> 16:34.875
(grunts)

16:34.959 --> 16:36.917
He's coming back! Hang on, hang on!

16:37.000 --> 16:38.375
(explosion)

16:42.417 --> 16:44.000
Ryan, all weapons are offline!

16:44.083 --> 16:46.333
Uh, it's like he's taking out
all of our vital systems!

16:46.417 --> 16:47.542
Everything's going red!

16:47.625 --> 16:48.542
Nothing's working!

16:48.625 --> 16:53.375
(alarm beeping)

16:54.500 --> 16:58.709
(growling)

16:58.792 --> 17:00.542
He's heading right for us!

17:00.625 --> 17:02.792
Abandon the robot! Get to the escape pod!

17:04.709 --> 17:06.583
(roaring)

17:11.000 --> 17:15.458
(shattered glass falling)

17:37.625 --> 17:41.250
(Ryan coughing)

17:47.458 --> 17:49.208
We'll... We'll stop you.

17:49.583 --> 17:51.625
No. You won't.

17:51.709 --> 17:53.000
It's already over.

17:55.333 --> 17:56.250
Guess again, jerk.

18:08.041 --> 18:09.625
Everyone get to the elevator!

18:09.709 --> 18:10.583
Go! Go! Go!

18:13.250 --> 18:14.834
Okay! Come on!

18:16.917 --> 18:17.875
(explosion)

18:20.500 --> 18:22.667
(grunts)

18:25.291 --> 18:26.500
Mark! Here!

18:32.917 --> 18:34.417
What're you... Don't go!

18:35.291 --> 18:36.333
Ry!

18:39.750 --> 18:42.458
(engines roaring)

18:48.667 --> 18:50.125
(grunting)

18:52.375 --> 18:54.166
You put up a good fight.

18:54.917 --> 18:55.834
But it's over.

18:55.917 --> 18:57.792
Oh, blah, blah, blah,
if you're gonna kill me,

18:57.875 --> 18:58.875
just get it over with.

18:59.500 --> 19:00.750
Kill you?

19:00.834 --> 19:02.667
I have a gift for you.

19:03.291 --> 19:07.166
The end of free will,
of struggle, decisions.

19:07.250 --> 19:12.291
The only voice you'll hear
inside your head... is mine.

19:15.917 --> 19:17.667
(electricity crackles)

19:24.041 --> 19:26.208
(growling)

19:30.834 --> 19:32.041
(growling)

19:38.166 --> 19:40.792
(roaring)

19:48.166 --> 19:51.166
(roaring)

19:58.208 --> 20:01.208
(somber music playing)

20:01.291 --> 20:03.000
(squeaks open)

20:10.458 --> 20:11.417
Ryan?

20:13.625 --> 20:14.375
Ryan?

20:33.542 --> 20:37.083
(whimpers)

20:46.000 --> 20:49.000
(crying)

20:57.041 --> 20:59.917
Ryan? Ryan!

21:03.417 --> 21:08.125
(theme music playing)

21:29.417 --> 21:30.250
(barking)
