Why wouldn't he have
mentioned it before?

05:06.306 --> 05:08.135
Well the show's in
less than a week.

05:10.137 --> 05:13.174
Okay, I'll let Lucky
know Buckshot's request.

05:14.555 --> 05:16.292
I told you I wasn't interested.

05:16.316 --> 05:18.604

the man about the showcase.

shit worked out?

05:21.044 --> 05:22.194

He wants an RV and a
driver to chauffeur him

05:25.083 --> 05:26.302

he doesn't show,

05:27.499 --> 05:28.649
I loose my advance.

05:28.673 --> 05:30.340
- Sir, I'm Carl Stillman's son.

05:30.364 --> 05:32.159
- Goddamnit, just do
it, get us a driver.

05:33.643 --> 05:35.231
And send that kid to my office.

05:41.755 --> 05:44.389
- You're Carl Stillman's kid.

05:44.413 --> 05:45.735
- Yeah.

05:45.759 --> 05:46.632
I thought since you and
my pops were tight,

05:46.656 --> 05:47.702
I'd stop by and
introduce myself.

05:47.726 --> 05:48.762
- Pretty lady, right?

05:51.454 --> 05:54.122
Spent the salad days with
this lovely creature.

05:54.146 --> 05:55.469
- Since my old man
rocked this place,

05:55.493 --> 05:56.780
I thought you might
hook me up with a spot

05:56.804 --> 05:57.804
in your showcase?

06:00.739 --> 06:01.820
- Your old man

06:01.844 --> 06:03.615
only cared about two things.

06:03.639 --> 06:05.582
Drinking and pussy.

06:05.606 --> 06:08.195
Neither of them made him
a good country singer.

06:09.990 --> 06:12.382
And he loved fucking
other people's wives,

06:12.406 --> 06:13.476
including mine.

06:16.962 --> 06:18.354
Here's some parting advice,

06:18.378 --> 06:20.449
find yourself a new last name.

06:26.420 --> 06:28.111
- Good luck you hick hop poser.

06:35.602 --> 06:38.339
- I thought you'd be halfway
back to Jersey by now.

06:38.363 --> 06:39.167
- Okay.

06:39.191 --> 06:40.341
Let's start over.

06:40.365 --> 06:42.205
I'm Charlie Stillman.

06:42.229 --> 06:44.345
I'm a country music fan.

06:44.369 --> 06:46.692
- You're part of the problem.

06:46.716 --> 06:48.901
Nashville doesn't need
anymore songs about

06:48.925 --> 06:51.421
beer, buds, or girls
in short shorts.

06:51.445 --> 06:53.043
That ain't country,

06:53.067 --> 06:54.182
bro,

06:54.206 --> 06:55.518
and neither are you.

07:07.530 --> 07:09.335
- Your phone call made it sound
like this Buckshot dude's

07:09.359 --> 07:10.820
kind of a jerk.

07:10.844 --> 07:12.166
- Have you ever
heard of the song,

His song writing's what
put him on the map,

07:26.756 --> 07:28.941

07:28.965 --> 07:30.104
People quit booking him

07:31.105 --> 07:31.910
cause he'd be too drunk to play,

07:31.934 --> 07:33.774
and that's if he even showed up.

07:33.798 --> 07:34.798
- Good as new.

07:36.490 --> 07:37.802
- Well thank you Charlie.

07:38.768 --> 07:40.056
You seem like a nice guy,

07:40.080 --> 07:42.507
and your voice ain't half bad.

07:42.531 --> 07:44.360
- Can you get me
into that showcase?

07:47.225 --> 07:48.305
- I can't help you there.

07:48.329 --> 07:49.410
- Can I use the restroom,

07:49.434 --> 07:50.687
like clean up?

07:50.711 --> 07:52.713
- Lucky is still here.

08:04.242 --> 08:05.046
- It's a lot of driving,

08:05.070 --> 08:06.565
but easy money.

08:06.589 --> 08:08.394
- Who's the headliner?

08:08.418 --> 08:09.223
- Buckshot Thomas.

08:09.247 --> 08:10.983
- Hell no.

08:11.007 --> 08:12.019
- Wait, what's he say?
- Shh.

08:12.043 --> 08:13.020
- Come on, Mike, sleep on it.

08:13.044 --> 08:14.504
- I wouldn't drive
that guy to jail.

08:14.528 --> 08:15.505
- Is that the driver?

08:15.529 --> 08:16.402
- Give it a second thought.

08:16.426 --> 08:18.152
- Okay, second thought, nope.

08:25.297 --> 08:26.297
- Wait, wait, wait.

08:28.784 --> 08:32.729
- Transportation is supposed
to be your goddamned job.

08:32.753 --> 08:35.145

08:53.878 --> 08:55.327
I can do this.

09:03.301 --> 09:04.312
- Here's the job.

09:04.336 --> 09:06.314
You've got five days to

09:06.338 --> 09:08.006

09:08.030 --> 09:09.283

09:09.307 --> 09:12.044
you make that
goddamned deadline.

09:12.068 --> 09:13.563
- I don't care about the money.

09:13.587 --> 09:15.323
I'll do it for a spot
on the showcase.

09:15.347 --> 09:18.948
- You've got some balls.

09:18.972 --> 09:21.744
Remember, that motherfucker
is not operating

09:21.768 --> 09:22.941

He makes it on time,

09:26.186 --> 09:28.395

25:50.272 --> 25:51.308
- Jersey, huh?

25:53.241 --> 25:54.459
Them people up there
bleed Springsteen.

25:54.483 --> 25:55.702
How come you didn't

25:55.726 --> 25:58.936
wind up singing
"Born in the USA"?

26:01.111 --> 26:02.699
- I like my dad's music better.

26:04.666 --> 26:05.919
- You're a weirdo, weren't you?

26:05.943 --> 26:07.058
A loner.

26:07.082 --> 26:09.050
Weird ass country kid.

26:10.983 --> 26:14.573
- Hey I got a question for you.

26:15.953 --> 26:16.965
- Shoot, partner.

26:16.989 --> 26:19.336
- Where'd those "Darling
Eyes" lyrics come from?

26:22.408 --> 26:23.730
- You know, kid, I've

26:23.754 --> 26:26.388
bagged more women than
I ever sang about.

26:26.412 --> 26:28.390
Kicked more ass than a

26:28.414 --> 26:31.003
Tijuana titty club bouncer,

26:32.142 --> 26:33.015
and hell, there ain't nobody

26:33.039 --> 26:35.328
in this damn world

26:35.352 --> 26:37.941
that can write a country
song better than me.

26:40.944 --> 26:41.748
- No, I'm being serious.

26:41.772 --> 26:43.012
Why'd you write "Darling Eyes"?

26:44.533 --> 26:46.477
You listening?

26:46.501 --> 26:47.478
- The hell with this.

26:47.502 --> 26:48.306
I'm leaving.

26:48.330 --> 26:49.366
- Are you nuts man?

26:50.885 --> 26:53.415
You're gonna get
yourself killed.

26:53.439 --> 26:54.243
- Kid.

26:54.267 --> 26:56.004
Just drive this goddamned thing

26:56.028 --> 26:57.892
and leave me the
hell alone, will ya?

27:00.688 --> 27:02.942

Hey, where the hell are we?

27:37.448 --> 27:39.071
- Some truck stop in Wyoming.

27:40.313 --> 27:43.120
- Hot damn, truck stops
are like Amsterdam.

27:43.144 --> 27:44.431
They got drugs and hookers

27:44.455 --> 27:45.570
and greasy food.

27:45.594 --> 27:47.262
- Hey man, let's make this
stop quick, all right.

27:47.286 --> 27:48.597
I just need some caffeine.

27:49.460 --> 27:50.265
If we make Nebraska tonight,

27:50.289 --> 27:51.128
we'll be back on schedule.

27:51.152 --> 27:52.577
- Wait, wait.

27:52.601 --> 27:53.475
Caffeine's for pussies kid.

27:53.499 --> 27:55.132
What you need is
some trucker speed.

27:55.156 --> 27:58.135
I think I can get us
some right over there.

27:58.159 --> 27:59.136
- No, man.

27:59.160 --> 28:00.758
That stuff's bad news.

28:00.782 --> 28:02.518
I'll be right back.

28:02.542 --> 28:05.245
- I might stretch my legs.

28:05.269 --> 28:06.269
- Hey, don't go far.

28:18.697 --> 28:19.836
What the fuck?

28:22.873 --> 28:24.402
- Hey.

28:24.426 --> 28:25.369
- Oh.

28:25.393 --> 28:26.508
- I've been doing some recon.

28:26.532 --> 28:27.785
Dealer's room has got a
blue bandana hanging on it.

28:27.809 --> 28:28.993
- No, man.

28:29.017 --> 28:30.098
Come on.

28:30.122 --> 28:31.616
- I'm in charge now.

28:31.640 --> 28:32.641
Yeah, come on.

28:34.160 --> 28:35.160
Let's go kid.

28:57.666 --> 28:58.666
Got my back, kid.

28:59.599 --> 29:00.473
- Man, I've been in
sketchier places than this.

29:00.497 --> 29:03.165
- This is no mobster
pizza joint.

29:03.189 --> 29:05.167
We got no clue what's
behind that door now.

29:05.191 --> 29:07.228
Keep your ears peeled
and your eyes open.

29:08.988 --> 29:10.369
Shit, you know what I mean.

29:23.071 --> 29:24.071
Go on in.

29:28.559 --> 29:29.664
- What, what you want.

29:35.704 --> 29:38.086
- That depends on what you
got there, cutie pie.

29:46.163 --> 29:47.371
- Check this shit out.

29:50.719 --> 29:53.792
- Hey screw all this, all
right, let's bounce.

29:54.723 --> 29:56.553
- You boys five oh?

29:57.485 --> 29:58.669
- Look man, all we want is

29:58.693 --> 29:59.936
two blues and one red.

30:04.112 --> 30:05.148
- All right.

30:06.218 --> 30:07.851
If you ain't no cop,

30:07.875 --> 30:10.118
then you got to do
a Tijuana twister.

30:12.362 --> 30:13.673
- Never have been a

30:14.536 --> 30:15.686
fan of Mexican drugs, but

30:15.710 --> 30:17.712
the kid here will do it.

30:22.510 --> 30:23.925
- Oh hell no man.

30:24.926 --> 30:26.421
- Then get the fuck out of here.

30:26.445 --> 30:27.445
- Hold on.

30:29.068 --> 30:31.150
How about if I just

30:31.174 --> 30:33.186
fill you full of lead?

30:34.556 --> 30:36.213
- Yo, chill out, all right.

30:38.940 --> 30:39.940
I'll do it.

30:49.364 --> 30:50.883
All right, now
give us the stuff.

30:53.196 --> 30:54.414
- You got to do the other line.

30:54.438 --> 30:55.519
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

30:55.543 --> 30:57.303
Step off, we had a
deal, all right.

31:01.652 --> 31:02.457
Wo shi shuo

31:02.481 --> 31:03.354
Tijuana twister?

31:03.378 --> 31:06.209
Or I'll fill you
both full of lead.

31:06.416 --> 31:08.049
- The woman's got
a point there kid

31:08.073 --> 31:09.246
and a shotgun.

31:10.869 --> 31:11.880
Go on.

31:11.904 --> 31:12.940
Get up there.

31:23.053 --> 31:24.134
Oh hey, hey,

31:24.158 --> 31:25.929
my uncle showed me
one trick, you know.

31:25.953 --> 31:27.378
Never back down from a threat.

31:27.402 --> 31:28.517
Always call their bluff.

31:28.541 --> 31:29.449
Nine out of 10 times,

31:29.473 --> 31:30.681
you come out on top, but.

31:31.751 --> 31:32.694
I don't know,

31:32.718 --> 31:34.237
a Chinese with a shotgun, hell.

31:38.172 --> 31:39.977
- Hey man, what do you think
those hillbillies gave me

31:40.001 --> 31:41.530
though dude?

31:41.554 --> 31:42.531
- Hell kid, I don't know.

31:42.555 --> 31:43.636
Just pretend like
you're on tour.

31:43.660 --> 31:44.844
- Hey, hey no more drugs
on this tour though, okay.

31:44.868 --> 31:46.639
- Well we got to do
what we got here.

31:46.663 --> 31:48.192
- No, give me those.

31:48.216 --> 31:49.216
- No, they're mine.

31:50.322 --> 31:51.737
- My stomach's wrecked, man.

31:52.876 --> 31:54.291
- Well we ain't ate in hours.

31:56.121 --> 31:57.363
- Fucking cocaine, dude.

32:20.076 --> 32:21.329
- Here are your burgers.

32:21.353 --> 32:22.986
- Thank you.

32:23.010 --> 32:24.010
Oh man.

32:25.978 --> 32:27.714
That ass is pure Crystal Gale.

32:27.738 --> 32:28.738
No, no, no, wait.

32:29.568 --> 32:31.270
Tammy Wynette,

32:31.294 --> 32:32.294
1972.

32:37.093 --> 32:39.129
- My tongue is
freaking numb, man.

32:44.134 --> 32:45.134
I'm not hungry.

32:47.275 --> 32:48.770
- You gotta eat.

32:48.794 --> 32:51.348
It's gonna help with that buzz.

32:59.598 --> 33:00.840
- I gotta piss.

33:03.809 --> 33:04.809
- Man.

33:09.228 --> 33:10.792
You in here boy?

33:10.816 --> 33:12.552
Where are you?

33:12.576 --> 33:13.576
Hey.

33:17.512 --> 33:19.076
Whoa, cowboy.

33:19.100 --> 33:21.182
Somebody got a
little bit sideways.

33:21.206 --> 33:23.011
Come on, there we go.

33:23.035 --> 33:25.048
Come on, that's it.

33:25.072 --> 33:26.072
I got ya.

33:30.180 --> 33:31.180
Oh man.

33:33.632 --> 33:34.436
Come on kid.

33:34.460 --> 33:35.460
Let's go.

33:36.290 --> 33:37.232
There we go.

33:37.256 --> 33:38.256
- I'm in love.

33:39.155 --> 33:40.028
No.

33:40.052 --> 33:41.985
Not with you, you jackass.

33:43.193 --> 33:46.379
She's like a Georgia peach.

33:46.403 --> 33:48.174
Ripe Georgia peach.

33:48.198 --> 33:49.198
- Uh huh, peach.

33:52.823 --> 33:54.939
- We gotta get to Nashville

33:54.963 --> 33:56.941
so I can see June.

33:56.965 --> 33:59.358
You gotta get us to Nashville.

33:59.382 --> 34:00.324
- Yeah, yeah.

34:00.348 --> 34:01.348
You just rest kid.

34:02.902 --> 34:05.008
I'll get us to our next
stop, don't worry.

34:07.769 --> 34:09.357
- Can you give me a bubble bath?

34:33.830 --> 34:35.221
♪ Gun by my side

34:35.245 --> 34:39.260

34:54.126 --> 34:55.126
- Hey kid.

34:56.473 --> 34:58.372
This place changed
it all for me.

35:00.684 --> 35:03.249
Told my old man I
wanted to be a singer

35:03.273 --> 35:04.481
right in this here room.

35:08.692 --> 35:10.453
Son of a bitch
kicked my ass good.

35:12.524 --> 35:14.571
Turned out the be the
best day of my life.

35:14.595 --> 35:19.438
Cause from then on,

35:19.462 --> 35:20.808
I knew I'd never be my old man.

35:23.535 --> 35:24.881
This here was my bedroom.

35:26.020 --> 35:28.447
I lined all these walls with

35:28.471 --> 35:32.244
Waylon Jennings
posters and albums.

35:32.268 --> 35:33.831
That old boy, his voice,

35:33.855 --> 35:35.029
his sound,

35:36.444 --> 35:37.928
never heard anything like it.

35:40.586 --> 35:42.046
Record executives

35:42.070 --> 35:43.945
hated the Waylon's sound.

35:43.969 --> 35:48.536
Though, he just walked the
hell away from Nashville,

35:48.560 --> 35:50.286
created his own damn style.

35:53.841 --> 35:54.841
- Hey where are we?

35:55.118 --> 35:56.568
- Luck, Texas.

35:59.018 --> 36:00.572
- Yo, wait, did you say Texas?

36:01.573 --> 36:02.515
- Yep.

36:02.539 --> 36:04.023
- You're screwing with me man.

36:05.093 --> 36:06.093
- Nope.

36:10.202 --> 36:11.869
- All right, fine.

36:11.893 --> 36:13.802
Your last stop, we got it done.

36:13.826 --> 36:14.596
Let's get back on the road,

36:14.620 --> 36:16.495
make up some time.

36:16.519 --> 36:17.559
- This ain't my last stop.

36:18.245 --> 36:19.280
I got one more to go.

36:20.626 --> 36:23.422
- Yeah, so do I man, playing
that showcase in Nashville.

36:24.285 --> 36:26.332
- Yeah I watch you kid.

36:26.356 --> 36:28.669
All I can think about
is wasted talent.

36:30.257 --> 36:32.407
Always chasing the next fad.

36:32.431 --> 36:34.375
What the hell good that
do your old man, huh?

36:34.399 --> 36:35.400
- Lecture time over?

36:36.504 --> 36:38.724
- You don't get it do you boy?

36:38.748 --> 36:40.588
Take the damn keys.

36:40.612 --> 36:43.038
Go play your fucking showcase.

36:43.062 --> 36:44.937
- It doesn't work like that man.

36:44.961 --> 36:46.628
I gotta get you to
the concert in time

36:46.652 --> 36:48.699
if I want to play
Lucky's showcase.

36:48.723 --> 36:50.805
- Like I said before,

36:50.829 --> 36:53.152
you go on stage with this act,

36:53.176 --> 36:55.775
I'll guarantee you're
gonna be carbon copy

36:55.799 --> 36:57.870
of a dozen other
guys just like you.

36:59.217 --> 37:00.228
You know, they sound like you.

37:00.252 --> 37:01.426
- I'm not stupid, man.

37:03.290 --> 37:05.153
I know my dad's songs need work.

37:08.364 --> 37:09.572
Right now it's all I got.

37:11.125 --> 37:13.517
- There's a way to
do this thing son.

37:13.541 --> 37:14.991
Hell, I can show you.

37:16.889 --> 37:18.408
Look, you help me

37:19.409 --> 37:20.409
to my last stop,

37:21.308 --> 37:22.940
I'll help you try to find your

37:22.964 --> 37:24.242
true country performance.

37:26.727 --> 37:27.980
- Well if we stick around here,

37:28.004 --> 37:29.775
we're not gonna make that
showcase or concert.

37:29.799 --> 37:30.603
- Just call Lucky,

37:30.627 --> 37:31.639
tell him you broke down.

37:31.663 --> 37:33.192
Make up some shit.

37:33.216 --> 37:34.193
He'll push a soundcheck.

37:34.217 --> 37:35.217
Always did.

37:35.908 --> 37:36.713
Come on kid.

37:36.737 --> 37:39.233
Buy us some extra time.

37:39.257 --> 37:41.328
You're in good hands son.

37:58.759 --> 37:59.805
- Who's that?

37:59.829 --> 38:02.014
- Hey there Nickel.

38:02.038 --> 38:03.326
Got a little friend here

38:03.350 --> 38:05.328
wants to say hello.

38:05.352 --> 38:06.352
- Let me have it.

38:12.600 --> 38:13.600
Neglected.

38:17.640 --> 38:18.640
Broke.

38:20.953 --> 38:22.369
Drinks too much.

38:24.647 --> 38:25.820
That's impossible.

38:26.683 --> 38:28.858
I didn't think they
stacked shit that high.

38:29.859 --> 38:33.908
- Settle down you old lanky
cranky hell raiser, you.

38:33.932 --> 38:35.116
- Oh, Buckshot Thomas,

38:35.140 --> 38:37.187
you salty son of a bitch.

38:37.211 --> 38:39.603
Oh goddamn.

38:39.627 --> 38:41.284
You turned into an old cuss.

38:42.285 --> 38:43.814
Who's your friend?

38:43.838 --> 38:46.023
- Well, I'd kind of like you

38:46.047 --> 38:47.059
to figure that out.

38:47.083 --> 38:48.083
- Yeah.

38:50.431 --> 38:51.926
Oh this feels like some made by

38:51.950 --> 38:54.135
some goddamned Yankee.

38:54.159 --> 38:55.885
Is this some roadie's guitar?

38:58.094 --> 38:59.094
He's green.

38:59.889 --> 39:00.889
Very green.

39:04.238 --> 39:07.562
He plays with a lot of grit.

39:07.586 --> 39:08.529
Problem is,

39:08.553 --> 39:11.911
it's got two different sounds.

39:11.935 --> 39:14.904
Sooner or later, one of
them's got to win out.

39:18.045 --> 39:19.022
What's your name boy?

39:19.046 --> 39:19.919
- I'm Charlie.

39:19.943 --> 39:20.920
I'm a singer songwriter
like Buckshot.

39:20.944 --> 39:22.646
- Yeah, is that so?

39:22.670 --> 39:25.960
Hey, you got some
determined lines there.

39:25.984 --> 39:28.687
Makes sense you held up
with this old outlaw.

39:28.711 --> 39:31.655
- Nickel, do they still
sell liquor in this county?

39:31.679 --> 39:34.520
- Dolly Parton still
sleep on her back?

39:35.994 --> 39:38.559
- Hey kid, go down there
and get us some go juice.

39:38.583 --> 39:40.871
- Yo man, we still
got training to do.

39:40.895 --> 39:43.529
- Place is two doors
up on the left.

39:43.553 --> 39:44.910
- Hustle up now.

39:44.934 --> 39:46.418
Don't dilly dally.

39:48.040 --> 39:49.628
- What the hell
brings you to town?

39:53.149 --> 39:55.679
- Well, on the way to
my farewell concert

39:55.703 --> 39:57.163
down there in Nashville.

39:57.187 --> 39:59.476
- Oh, one last concert.

39:59.500 --> 40:03.135
Then what?

40:03.159 --> 40:04.159
- Nickel,

40:04.885 --> 40:07.104
did you ever wonder if

40:07.128 --> 40:09.831
this was just it?

40:09.855 --> 40:11.695
- This is it for me.

40:11.719 --> 40:13.456
All these guitars

40:13.480 --> 40:15.378
live on long after I'm gone.

40:16.448 --> 40:18.070
Like your songs.

40:19.865 --> 40:22.879
- Yeah well, I'm just
trying to make peace

40:22.903 --> 40:24.145
with all this shit I did.

40:34.259 --> 40:36.099
- Hey, June.

40:36.123 --> 40:38.170
- Charlie, you gotta
call in on time.

40:38.194 --> 40:40.206
Lucky's threatening to
send out another driver

40:40.230 --> 40:40.931
to replace you.

40:40.955 --> 40:41.518
- It's Buckshot, he went crazy.

40:41.542 --> 40:42.208
- Well what happened?

40:42.232 --> 40:43.727
- He forced some drugs on me

40:43.751 --> 40:44.694
and then I must have passed out

40:44.718 --> 40:45.867
cause then he hijacked the RV

40:45.891 --> 40:47.237
and took us to Luck, Texas.

40:48.204 --> 40:49.204
June?

40:51.000 --> 40:51.701
June, you there?

40:51.725 --> 40:53.875
- That's west Texas.

40:53.899 --> 40:54.945
You gotta get back on the road,

40:54.969 --> 40:56.188
you're gonna miss the show.

40:56.212 --> 41:00.088
- Can you maybe like say we're
in Nebraska or something?

41:00.112 --> 41:00.744
I swear when I see you again,

41:00.768 --> 41:01.768
I'll make it up to you.

41:04.945 --> 41:05.784
- I'm trusting you Charlie,

41:05.808 --> 41:07.751
don't screw this up.

41:07.775 --> 41:08.787
- I owe you bigs.

41:08.811 --> 41:09.811
I gotta go.

41:12.539 --> 41:17.381
- Well, you should have
everything you need.

41:17.405 --> 41:18.521
- You know, after all
this is done Nickel,

41:18.545 --> 41:21.144
I'd like to leave you my guitar.

41:21.168 --> 41:22.583
- What do I need it for?

41:24.551 --> 41:25.551
- Safe keeping.

41:27.208 --> 41:28.555
- What's going on with you?

41:32.351 --> 41:33.846
- Here's the go
juice you ordered.

41:33.870 --> 41:35.285
- We gotta mosey along here.

41:36.459 --> 41:37.529
- Y'all just got here.

41:39.358 --> 41:40.335
- We'll swing on back after

41:40.359 --> 41:42.292
we're done with everything.

41:43.501 --> 41:44.502
Grab that suitcase kid.

41:46.607 --> 41:47.953
- You gonna stop by Cottonwood?

42:24.887 --> 42:26.992
- Well boy, this is
where it all started.

42:35.000 --> 42:37.347
Welcome to Luck, Texas, VFW.

42:39.073 --> 42:40.903
- Man, they just
leave this unlocked?

42:42.214 --> 42:43.019
- Hold on.

42:43.043 --> 42:44.562
I gotta show you the best part.

42:53.087 --> 42:55.687
- Man we came all this
way for free booze?

42:55.711 --> 42:57.033
- Yeah, I am gonna have a drink

42:57.057 --> 42:58.448
while you get yourself ready.

42:58.472 --> 42:59.553
- I am ready.

42:59.577 --> 43:02.694
- Now put that thing down.

43:02.718 --> 43:03.798
Pick that up.

43:03.822 --> 43:05.962
Go on back here and get
yourself prepared.

43:23.497 --> 43:25.095
What the hell's taking so long?

43:25.119 --> 43:26.500
- This is ridiculous.

43:28.295 --> 43:29.572
- Part of training.

43:30.953 --> 43:31.954
Get on out here.

43:39.099 --> 43:40.099
Yeehaw.

43:43.931 --> 43:44.931
Whew.

43:46.175 --> 43:47.728
Now, we can get started.

43:49.419 --> 43:50.419
Grab that guitar.

44:02.847 --> 44:04.134
Let me see that book.

44:04.158 --> 44:05.884
Let me see that notebook.

44:12.857 --> 44:15.100
All right, first lesson,

44:17.137 --> 44:18.114
I should of done that

44:18.138 --> 44:19.553
a long time ago.

44:22.383 --> 44:25.742
Charlie, I became a
song writer because

44:25.766 --> 44:27.986
I like telling my stories.

44:28.010 --> 44:29.297
Some of them made up,

44:29.321 --> 44:30.321
some of them real.

44:31.738 --> 44:33.198
All that matters is that

44:33.222 --> 44:34.672
I know where they came from.

44:35.707 --> 44:38.721
It's that conviction that
people connect with.

44:38.745 --> 44:42.345
- Yeah man, I don't know
where to start though.

44:42.369 --> 44:45.037
Like I don't have stories.

44:45.061 --> 44:45.935
It's the first time I've
been out of Jersey.

44:45.959 --> 44:47.892

man, didn't you?

44:50.480 --> 44:51.526
Hey, pretty sure

44:51.550 --> 44:53.518

thrown you for a loop.

44:54.864 --> 44:56.003
Write about that stuff.

44:56.901 --> 44:57.901
It's got meaning.

45:02.044 --> 45:05.471
- Man, man, you're supposed
to be teaching me, though.

45:05.495 --> 45:07.187
- I should be praying for you.

45:08.084 --> 45:09.855
Can you just concentrate

50:28.163 --> 50:30.210
And there's a wig
sitting next to him,

50:30.234 --> 50:31.590

hell, but I mean.

50:39.070 --> 50:39.771
That's how he became
Kenny Rogers.

50:39.795 --> 50:43.533
I don't think he'd make it...

50:43.557 --> 50:44.672

- I ain't seen
anybody since 1968.

51:22.803 --> 51:24.057
- Man for all I
know, that jackoff

51:24.081 --> 51:26.300
might have already
hightailed it to Nashville.

51:26.324 --> 51:27.508
- Don't feel bad.

51:27.532 --> 51:29.131
Buckshot's pulled
that bird trick

51:29.155 --> 51:31.157
on more than a few ole
boys around here.

51:32.710 --> 51:35.609
News travels fast
in a small town.

51:41.581 --> 51:42.720
See this here guitar?

51:43.859 --> 51:45.309
Got a lot of strings on it.

51:46.482 --> 51:48.011

51:48.035 --> 51:49.278
to throw you out of tune.

51:50.279 --> 51:51.636
But,

51:51.660 --> 51:53.351
just cause there's
one out of tune

51:54.421 --> 51:56.423
doesn't mean all the
others follow suit.

53:25.754 --> 53:26.731
- No, I can explain.

53:26.755 --> 53:27.559
June had nothing to do with it.

53:27.583 --> 53:28.733
She wasn't...

53:28.757 --> 53:29.734

I really don't have
anything to say.

54:16.045 --> 54:19.842

where you were going.
