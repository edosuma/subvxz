Yo, Cap's done talking

FREDDY:
Yeah, what's
the fire cop up here for?

00:49.910 --> 00:51.710
Must be about
Rebecca's death, huh?

00:51.910 --> 00:53.220
MANNY:
Gentlemen.

00:54.310 --> 00:55.360
Bode,

00:55.560 --> 00:57.400
how's Rebecca's
eulogy coming?

00:59.750 --> 01:01.060
It's not.

01:03.100 --> 01:04.850
You know,

01:05.050 --> 01:06.850
I don't think that I should
be the one writing this.

01:07.050 --> 01:08.590
Well, you're the person
who knew her the best here.

01:08.790 --> 01:10.340
An inmate's death can
weigh heavy on the crew,

01:10.530 --> 01:12.280
and they're looking to you
as a leader.

01:13.330 --> 01:14.940
I'm technically not the leader.

01:16.110 --> 01:17.810
You are.

01:19.600 --> 01:21.650
When Eve went down out there,
Rebecca stepped up

01:21.850 --> 01:23.130
because we
were rudderless.

01:23.330 --> 01:24.440
Look what happened.

01:24.640 --> 01:27.000
That's-that's not just on me.

01:27.200 --> 01:29.480
So, what, it's on me?

01:29.680 --> 01:31.830
Our captain should
have been there.

01:32.030 --> 01:34.180
You want to place blame?

01:35.570 --> 01:37.010
Blame the tree, Bode.

01:37.210 --> 01:38.970
You're speaking
at her memorial, man.

01:39.170 --> 01:39.710
Not at a trial.

01:39.910 --> 01:42.880
Her memorial.

01:44.060 --> 01:45.750
She shouldn't be a memory.

01:46.930 --> 01:48.320
She should still be alive.

01:52.190 --> 01:53.540
[sighs]

01:56.150 --> 01:57.690
Hey, Chief, can I have a word?

01:57.890 --> 01:59.040
VINCE:
Yeah.

01:59.240 --> 02:01.300
Want a cup of
my famous Leone mud?

02:01.500 --> 02:03.950
No, I'm not planning
on staying long.

02:04.150 --> 02:05.480
Um...

02:05.680 --> 02:07.990
This is a notice of
my leave of absence.

02:14.480 --> 02:17.000
Losing Rebecca,
that-that was tough.

02:18.220 --> 02:19.400
[sighs]

02:19.600 --> 02:20.870
But you passed
the competence inquiry.

02:21.960 --> 02:23.500
Yeah, the department's
standards are one thing,

02:23.690 --> 02:25.630
but my own...

02:25.830 --> 02:27.850
She was one of us,
and she died on my watch.

02:28.050 --> 02:29.330
And I would
ask you

02:29.530 --> 02:31.200
to give yourself
the same understanding

02:31.400 --> 02:32.680
I know you would give
anybody else on this crew.

02:32.880 --> 02:34.980
Yeah, but I'm having
a hard time shaking the feeling

02:35.180 --> 02:36.730
that I let her down.

02:36.930 --> 02:39.370
Hey, Eve...

02:40.980 --> 02:42.990
We're gonna get you
through this.

02:43.190 --> 02:45.120
We will, all right?

02:46.990 --> 02:48.650
Well, I-I just don't know
what to do, Chief.

Cap's right.
Sometimes it's nobody's fault.

03:12.440 --> 03:14.150
Rebecca stepped up
when I should have.

03:14.350 --> 03:15.720
Can't always be the hero, dude.

03:15.920 --> 03:18.200
But you got a chance
to step up here, right?

known better.

...risking your life comes easy

Federal wildland firefighters,
Type 1. Best of the best.

04:04.840 --> 04:06.420
They're sent to the worst fires
in the country.

04:06.620 --> 04:08.120
That means we're in
for a bad one, fellas.

04:08.320 --> 04:10.300
So everybody, look out
for each other. Do you copy?

We copy.
Let's go.

Team, I need everyone
on their A game today.

04:18.850 --> 04:20.220
Drake County is no Edgewater.

04:20.420 --> 04:22.180
The terrain,
the winds--

04:22.380 --> 04:23.530
it's all
extremely temperamental.

04:23.730 --> 04:25.360
Kind of like
the people.

04:25.560 --> 04:27.050
Especially in
a maximum security prison.

04:27.250 --> 04:30.230
Drake County firefighters
are fighting the blaze,

04:30.430 --> 04:33.150
which is leaving the local
services completely overwhelmed

04:33.350 --> 04:34.190
with the evacuation,

04:34.390 --> 04:36.110
so we're
gonna help out.

04:36.310 --> 04:37.720
The last thing on the list
is gonna be the prison.

04:37.920 --> 04:39.630
You're gonna help get
those prisoners to safety,

04:39.830 --> 04:41.500
and you're gonna watch
each other's backs.

04:41.700 --> 04:42.850
Always, Chief.

04:43.050 --> 04:44.160
It's good to have you back.

04:44.360 --> 04:45.250
Everyone missed you last week.

04:45.450 --> 04:47.860
Good to be back.

Hey, that was brave,

04:54.370 --> 04:56.070
offering up a kidney.

04:57.340 --> 04:58.610
Well, wasn't able to give it,

04:58.810 --> 05:00.740
so hardly worth
a pat on the back.

05:00.940 --> 05:01.830
Yeah, but-but I get it.

05:02.030 --> 05:03.960
Your dad died a hero.

05:04.160 --> 05:05.870
You know, the pressure to
follow in his footsteps

05:06.070 --> 05:07.790
and to save the day,
it's just crushing,

05:07.990 --> 05:09.750
and when you can't,
I totally...

05:09.950 --> 05:12.130
Okay, first of all, hold up.
How do you know about my dad?

05:13.400 --> 05:14.970
Aw, I was just...
I was looking you up online

05:15.170 --> 05:16.230
and I found this...

05:16.430 --> 05:17.800
Looking me up?

05:18.000 --> 05:19.060
What for?

05:19.260 --> 05:20.410
Ah...

05:20.610 --> 05:22.150
I just thought we could bro up.

05:22.350 --> 05:23.630
You want to bro up?

05:23.830 --> 05:26.320
You keep my name out

05:28.240 --> 05:29.550
I thought you were
taking a leave.

05:29.750 --> 05:31.600
Changed my mind.

05:31.800 --> 05:33.820
Did you change your mind or did
Chief Leone change your mind?

05:34.020 --> 05:35.380
Rebecca died trying to help me.

17:57.500 --> 17:58.950
Bode, what happened
to Rebecca was an accident,

17:59.150 --> 18:00.390
but what he's doing
is deliberately putting his crew

18:00.590 --> 18:01.690
and our crew in harm's way.

18:01.890 --> 18:04.440
Sacrificing to save others.

18:04.630 --> 18:06.440
Something I wish
I could have done for Rebecca,

18:06.640 --> 18:07.830
and now I have a chance.

18:08.030 --> 18:08.920
Man, there's a difference
between sacrifice

18:09.120 --> 18:10.570
and suicide, Bode.

18:10.770 --> 18:12.010
And I gave your dad my word

18:12.210 --> 18:13.230
that I'd look out
for you on my crew.

18:13.430 --> 18:14.790
We got to look out
for my dad,

18:14.990 --> 18:16.920
by stopping this fire
from hitting that prison.

18:18.140 --> 18:20.090
Gabriela's down there, too.

18:21.620 --> 18:23.110
Come on, Cap,

18:23.310 --> 18:25.140
let's show these Hotshots
what Three Rock's made of.

18:29.100 --> 18:31.240
All right.

18:31.440 --> 18:33.590
All right, Three Rock.

18:33.790 --> 18:36.680
On the move, with caution,
one step at a time.

18:36.880 --> 18:37.860
You copy?FIREFIGHTERS:
Copy.

18:38.060 --> 18:39.160
Let's go.

18:41.900 --> 18:43.650
[alarm blaring]

18:43.850 --> 18:47.040
These aren't civilians ready
to evacuate calmly, single file.

18:47.240 --> 18:48.830
These prisoners have agendas

18:49.030 --> 18:50.920
deeper than safety alone.

18:51.120 --> 18:52.090
Gang agendas.

18:52.290 --> 18:53.790
Not all of them,
obviously, but...

18:53.990 --> 18:56.910
a few chaos agents can ruin
things for the whole bunch.

18:57.960 --> 18:59.580
[shouting]

18:59.780 --> 19:01.050
That's right!

19:04.440 --> 19:06.110
Chief, what do we do?

19:06.310 --> 19:07.190
We answer the call.

19:07.390 --> 19:08.630
Warden, you got
to open the door.

19:08.830 --> 19:09.890
We can't evacuate
without proper manpower.

19:10.090 --> 19:11.330
We'll be outnumbered.

19:11.530 --> 19:12.460
If the mattress fire grows,

19:12.660 --> 19:13.850
it'll burn this prison down

19:14.050 --> 19:14.900
before the wildfire
even gets here.

19:15.100 --> 19:16.460
You think they're gonna stand by

19:16.660 --> 19:17.600
and politely let you put it out?

19:17.790 --> 19:18.940
When their choices
are step aside

19:19.140 --> 19:20.600
or burn to death,
I'm hoping I get my way.

19:20.800 --> 19:22.330
Come on.

19:23.550 --> 19:25.170
Open Cell Block 5.

19:25.370 --> 19:27.650
[lock buzzes, latch clicks]

19:27.850 --> 19:30.700
So, I need access to your
people's personnel files.

19:30.890 --> 19:33.830
If they're clean, you have
nothing to worry about.

19:34.030 --> 19:35.920
Yeah, I don't really buy that.

19:36.120 --> 19:37.880
And I can throw up
a lot of red tape

19:38.080 --> 19:39.570
and slow that down,

19:39.770 --> 19:41.270
between the legal disclosures

19:41.470 --> 19:43.180
and the privacy breaches.

19:44.350 --> 19:45.840
You're gonna have
to give to get.

19:46.040 --> 19:48.450
I'd eventually get in, Sharon.

19:48.650 --> 19:50.270
Eventually.

19:55.410 --> 19:57.640
Fine.

19:57.830 --> 19:59.460
Our investigators
missed something

19:59.660 --> 20:01.640
at the Neil Wallace
Home and Development fire.

20:01.840 --> 20:03.730
An accelerant
under the car

20:03.930 --> 20:06.560
matched the one
at the Hill fire.

20:06.760 --> 20:08.250
Whoever's committing
these burns

20:08.450 --> 20:09.950
knows what we would
be looking for,

20:10.150 --> 20:11.690
knows how to hide
their tracks.

20:11.890 --> 20:14.520
Somebody smart.

20:14.720 --> 20:16.390
The burn patterns there
also suggest

20:16.590 --> 20:18.210
they used
the same torches we do.

20:19.560 --> 20:21.880
Every station uses drip torches.

20:22.080 --> 20:25.750
42 was first on scene
at every one of these incidents.

20:25.950 --> 20:28.360
No, they weren't.
Not at Drake County.

20:28.560 --> 20:31.150
That's two hours away.
Everyone on my team was here.

20:31.350 --> 20:32.450
How do you know unless

20:32.650 --> 20:34.140
you personally tuck them in
at night?

20:36.230 --> 20:38.460
You get me the date and the time

20:38.660 --> 20:40.160
the Drake County fire started,

20:40.360 --> 20:42.460
and I will get you an alibi
for every one of mine.

20:42.660 --> 20:44.810
You get alibis, great.

20:45.010 --> 20:46.160
If you don't,

20:46.360 --> 20:48.470
I get my access to your files.

20:48.670 --> 20:50.980
You got to give to get.

20:57.160 --> 20:59.220
Warden Henley
was not exaggerating.

20:59.420 --> 21:02.130
The entire medical staff bailed.

21:02.330 --> 21:03.610
Okay, million dollar question.
Why don't we?

21:03.810 --> 21:05.310
I mean, I-I signed up
to be a firefighter,

21:05.510 --> 21:07.010
not a prison guard peacemaker.

21:07.210 --> 21:08.620
Look, you want
to bro up with me?

21:08.820 --> 21:09.840
Man up first.

21:10.040 --> 21:11.190
GABRIELA:
I'd say woman up,

21:11.390 --> 21:13.280
but you get the point, O'Reilly.

21:13.480 --> 21:16.410
[gasping] Help.

21:16.610 --> 21:17.630
Hey, hey,

21:17.830 --> 21:18.980
we are helping.
I promise.

21:19.180 --> 21:19.980
What's the plan?

21:20.180 --> 21:21.150
All right,
we need to make

21:21.350 --> 21:22.370
a three-sided
dressing, all right?

21:22.570 --> 21:24.240
Cover the hole,
allow the air to escape.

21:24.440 --> 21:25.770
But we don't want
that same air

21:25.970 --> 21:27.160
getting stuck back
inside of him.

21:27.360 --> 21:28.810
You hear?Ah, crap. They're all locked.

21:29.010 --> 21:30.160
I can make a square out of this

21:30.360 --> 21:31.600
Yeah, perfect.
That'll work.

21:31.800 --> 21:33.120
JAKE:
All right, listen,
we're gonna go ahead

21:33.320 --> 21:34.470
and tape down
each of the three sides,

21:34.670 --> 21:35.950
allowing the air to escape
out of the fourth.

21:36.150 --> 21:36.950
Okay?
Okay.

21:37.150 --> 21:39.380
Got you.Good.

21:42.430 --> 21:45.040
"Julia." Is that your daughter?

21:46.210 --> 21:47.750
I was just
talking to her.

21:47.940 --> 21:50.000
J-Julia's here?

21:51.870 --> 21:52.970
Yes.

21:53.170 --> 21:54.700
And your wife.

21:55.700 --> 21:59.190
Tell her to get
Julia out of here.

21:59.390 --> 22:01.240
If she's anything like me,

22:01.440 --> 22:03.320
she's not leaving her dad.

22:10.540 --> 22:12.510
[wind gusting]

22:12.710 --> 22:13.900
MANNY:
All right, that's it. That's it.

22:14.100 --> 22:15.210
That's two miles.

22:15.410 --> 22:16.430
KNOX:
We're here.

22:16.630 --> 22:18.250
You wanted
eyes in the sky?

22:18.450 --> 22:20.330
J.T., bring that drone
footage over here.

22:22.420 --> 22:23.780
Hideous beast,
ain't she?

22:23.980 --> 22:25.440
MANNY:
It's too close for comfort.

22:25.630 --> 22:27.390
Just over
a mile ahead.

22:27.590 --> 22:28.660
This is where
we lay our trap.

22:28.860 --> 22:30.310
Thousand feet of line.

22:30.510 --> 22:31.960
FREDDY:
Dude did not just say
1,000 feet.

22:32.160 --> 22:32.960
Let's hear him out.

22:33.160 --> 22:34.050
No, I'm done
doing that.

22:34.250 --> 22:35.490
That fire's a mile out.

22:35.690 --> 22:37.400
You want us to cut
1,000 feet of line?

22:37.600 --> 22:39.620
Even with your Hotshot crew,
that's not possible.

22:39.820 --> 22:41.100
You fight fire
with fire.

22:41.300 --> 22:42.320
Controlled burn.

22:42.520 --> 22:43.670
Faster, more
efficient.

22:43.870 --> 22:45.500
With winds past
40 miles an hour?

22:45.700 --> 22:47.070
It's a death trap.

22:47.260 --> 22:48.980
That'll kill
the brush and us.

22:49.180 --> 22:52.240
Better to die a hero
than run a coward.

22:53.720 --> 22:55.120
Listen to yourself.

22:55.320 --> 22:57.420
That tattoo on your neck,
it means "professional."

22:57.620 --> 22:58.820
And right now,
you're the furthest from it.

22:59.020 --> 22:59.820
KNOX:
This tattoo?

23:00.020 --> 23:03.040
Stands for "Prometheus."

23:03.240 --> 23:05.340
The god of fire?

23:05.540 --> 23:07.860
Three Rock,
let's pack it up.

23:09.510 --> 23:11.220
You run,

23:11.420 --> 23:13.790
that prison
and all the people in it

23:13.990 --> 23:15.400
go up in flames.

23:15.600 --> 23:16.390
That's on you.

23:18.520 --> 23:19.880
And when you

23:20.080 --> 23:21.800
and your entire Hotshot
crew burn to death?

23:22.000 --> 23:23.540
That's on you, homie.

23:23.740 --> 23:26.010
Three Rock, let's roll.

23:27.440 --> 23:30.410
Hey, Knox. As division leader,

23:30.610 --> 23:31.760
you can fold me into your crew.

23:31.960 --> 23:33.630
Come on.
Don't pull this.

23:33.830 --> 23:35.290
No.

23:35.490 --> 23:36.770
Bode's got something
he needs to work out,

23:36.970 --> 23:37.810
and that's his choice.

23:38.010 --> 23:40.250
If Knox'll
have him.

23:40.450 --> 23:42.420
Request granted, Leone.

23:44.810 --> 23:45.860
[prisoners shouting]

23:46.060 --> 23:47.130
EVE:
Get back! Get back!

23:47.320 --> 23:49.000
We're here to help!

23:49.200 --> 23:50.480
VINCE:
Let us put out
the fire, all right?

23:50.680 --> 23:51.650
EVE:
Hey! Hey!

23:51.850 --> 23:52.780
Stop! [grunts] Get that...

23:52.980 --> 23:54.470
[shouts]

23:55.690 --> 23:57.960
Hey!
Get back!

23:58.160 --> 23:59.880
Hey, hey, hey! Hey!

24:00.080 --> 24:03.130
Y'all want to fight each other
or you want to live?

24:04.440 --> 24:06.480
Take it easy. Let us help you.

24:07.700 --> 24:08.800
Let us go!

24:09.000 --> 24:10.360
We're gonna
die up here!

24:12.320 --> 24:13.630
Hey, stand back.

24:13.830 --> 24:14.930
Stand back!

24:24.200 --> 24:26.120
What'd you guys
start this fire with?

24:26.320 --> 24:28.430
Pruno. Burns real good.

24:28.630 --> 24:30.250
Then these
are useless.

24:31.200 --> 24:32.940
Jackets?
Yup.

24:43.130 --> 24:45.350
[man groaning]

24:47.310 --> 24:49.220
Burn victim.

24:57.400 --> 24:59.490
We need to get him
to an infirmary.

25:02.370 --> 25:04.540
That's not gonna be easy.

25:11.550 --> 25:13.040
Respect, Leone.

25:13.240 --> 25:15.940
When you parole, you've more
than earned a shot with us.

25:17.690 --> 25:19.860
You need to be alive
to parole, Bode.

25:21.470 --> 25:23.350
Better to die a hero
than run away as a coward.

25:23.550 --> 25:25.660
Man, you can talk like
him all you want, Bode,

25:25.860 --> 25:27.270
but you're nothing
like him.

25:27.470 --> 25:29.660
You have so much
more to lose, man.

25:29.860 --> 25:31.970
You have friends,
you have family.

25:32.170 --> 25:33.670
Gabriela.

25:33.870 --> 25:36.320
You forgetting about
Rebecca already?

25:36.520 --> 25:39.240
You have misplaced
survivor's guilt, Bode.

25:39.440 --> 25:40.800
And we can debate
that all day,

25:41.000 --> 25:41.840
but right now,
we don't have time.

25:49.240 --> 25:52.020
Thought you were gone,
Three Rock.

25:56.110 --> 25:58.470
If I had to write your eulogy,

25:58.670 --> 25:59.870
I'd say the
same thing

26:00.070 --> 26:01.090
you said about
Rebecca this morning.

26:01.280 --> 26:04.040
You shouldn't be a memory.

26:11.910 --> 26:13.570
You guys gonna let us through?

26:15.000 --> 26:16.320
Let us get him out.

26:16.520 --> 26:19.020
Come back,
we'll evacuate all of you.

26:19.220 --> 26:20.410
Okay?

26:20.610 --> 26:21.500
[lock buzzes]GUARD: Open up 5!

26:21.700 --> 26:22.670
Hey, get back.

26:22.870 --> 26:25.100
[prisoners shouting]

26:26.620 --> 26:28.670
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

26:29.450 --> 26:30.850
[shouts]

26:31.050 --> 26:32.670
EVE:Chief!

26:35.500 --> 26:36.640
Hey, come on,

26:36.840 --> 26:38.170
let's go,
let's go!

26:38.370 --> 26:39.600
Okay, okay.

26:39.800 --> 26:40.560
VINCE: Hey,
come on! Move!

26:40.760 --> 26:43.340
[grunting]

26:59.830 --> 27:01.270
[grunting]

27:03.530 --> 27:04.800
HENLEY:Now do you get what
we're up against?

27:05.000 --> 27:06.760
Let's not
do that again.

27:06.960 --> 27:07.760
You know, you could've
left him behind.

27:07.960 --> 27:08.760
Nobody would've
blamed you.

27:08.960 --> 27:10.190
GUARD:
All clear! Close 5!

27:11.540 --> 27:14.200
[shouting indistinctly]

27:14.400 --> 27:15.860
I was answering
the call.

27:16.060 --> 27:17.340
He could've died
back there.

27:17.530 --> 27:18.550
You could've died, too.

27:18.750 --> 27:20.370
I need a firefighter,
not a fallen hero.

27:25.460 --> 27:27.770
Eve is cleared.

27:28.990 --> 27:30.820
This is a waste of my time.

27:34.130 --> 27:36.870
Took an extra day's leave?

27:43.050 --> 27:46.060
What are you doing
in Drake County?

27:46.260 --> 27:47.710
No.

27:47.910 --> 27:50.240
No, no, no, no, no, no.

27:50.440 --> 27:52.280
Jake and Collin,
give us a hand.

27:52.480 --> 27:53.720
I-I got it,
I got it.

27:53.920 --> 27:54.980
Whoa, whoa, hey.
What happened?

27:55.180 --> 27:56.720
VINCE:
Wildfire wasn't enough.

27:56.920 --> 27:58.290
They had to start their own.

27:58.490 --> 27:59.860
I can't be in the same
room as this dude.

28:00.060 --> 28:01.120
GABRIELA:
What do you mean?

28:01.320 --> 28:02.470
His people stabbed me.

28:02.670 --> 28:04.160

40:44.730 --> 40:47.400
then maybe he'd come back home.

40:48.530 --> 40:50.270
Your dad?

40:54.450 --> 40:55.760
And what happened?

40:55.960 --> 40:57.200
Well...

40:57.400 --> 40:59.900
Vince came instead.

41:00.100 --> 41:01.990
Wow.

41:02.180 --> 41:03.860
[whistles]

41:04.060 --> 41:05.160
Lucky you.

41:05.360 --> 41:07.330
Yeah, lucky me.

41:09.330 --> 41:10.550
Hey.

41:11.940 --> 41:13.650
I need to talk
to someone,

41:13.850 --> 41:15.430
and it can't be Vince.

41:15.630 --> 41:17.300
[chuckles]

41:17.500 --> 41:18.440
Okay.

41:18.640 --> 41:21.390
I'm flattered to be runner-up.

41:22.950 --> 41:24.400
What's up?

41:24.600 --> 41:27.450
It's the arson
investigation.

41:27.650 --> 41:29.010
Mmm.

41:29.210 --> 41:31.310
Snow brought me up to speed.

41:32.620 --> 41:34.370
She thinks
it's someone at the 42.

41:34.570 --> 41:36.020
[laughs]

41:36.220 --> 41:37.190
No way.

41:38.580 --> 41:40.280
She's right.

41:41.670 --> 41:43.680
I wanted to get alibis
for all of them,

41:43.880 --> 41:45.980
so I pulled their
Bell Pass logs.

41:47.330 --> 41:50.240
He was at the Drake County fire
when the blaze started.

41:53.200 --> 41:54.680
Who was?

41:55.680 --> 41:56.870
Jake.

41:57.070 --> 41:58.520
Come on, Sharon.

41:58.720 --> 42:00.780
All of the evidence
points to him.

42:00.980 --> 42:03.570
Eve, Gabriela, Collin,
every one of them was here,

42:03.770 --> 42:05.920
every one of them
is accounted for at every fire

42:06.120 --> 42:08.300
except for him.

42:11.570 --> 42:12.360
He doesn't just
fit the profile,

42:12.560 --> 42:15.190
Manny, he is the profile.

42:15.390 --> 42:16.540
The hero complex,

42:16.740 --> 42:18.020
being at the scene
of the crime.

42:18.220 --> 42:20.360
I don't believe it.

42:21.580 --> 42:23.970
Except Vince and I are
the only ones who know...

42:25.580 --> 42:27.420
...but this wouldn't be
the first fire

42:27.620 --> 42:29.630
that Jake has started.
