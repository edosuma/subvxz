WEBVTT

01:43.746 --> 01:44.947
That's great, Bunny.

01:44.981 --> 01:47.215
As you know, Bunny has won...

01:54.456 --> 01:56.425
Ready to meet
that new challenger?

01:58.326 --> 01:59.662
Okay, Bunny.

02:01.831 --> 02:04.433
Let's bring in
that new mystery challenger.

02:05.534 --> 02:07.003
Well, hello!

02:12.809 --> 02:14.509
Hey, Ethan, it's Lynn.

02:14.543 --> 02:17.245
Jesus, you're worse at answering
your phone than Shane.

02:17.279 --> 02:19.414
Listen, I don't remember
what time we said

02:19.448 --> 02:23.418
for tomorrow night,
but just come around like 6:30.

02:23.452 --> 02:25.520
Oh, also, Shane wanted me
to tell you,

02:25.554 --> 02:27.489
a few more people
are coming now.

02:27.522 --> 02:29.291
I know he said
it'd just be us,

02:29.324 --> 02:31.326
but a few of his work friends
will be here

02:31.359 --> 02:33.029
and my friend Kristen
and her boyfriend.

02:33.062 --> 02:35.530
- Mom! Look what I made!
- Honey, hold on,

02:35.564 --> 02:36.866
I'm on the phone.

02:36.899 --> 02:39.736
I know you're gonna sleep all
day, but if you don't show up,

02:39.769 --> 02:41.871
we're coming over there
to drag you out of bed.

02:41.904 --> 02:43.271
All right.

03:08.363 --> 03:09.799
Alex?

03:11.067 --> 03:12.034
What?

03:12.068 --> 03:15.504
You gotta stop throwing rocks
at my mailbox.

03:15.537 --> 03:16.873
Why?

03:16.906 --> 03:18.641
'Cause I park my van here.

03:18.674 --> 03:20.977
I don't do it
when your van's there.

03:21.010 --> 03:23.646
Well, that's not true.

03:23.679 --> 03:25.848
I have a very good aim.

03:25.882 --> 03:27.016
Okay.

03:27.049 --> 03:29.752
Can you just stop, please?

03:43.900 --> 03:46.501
Coming up, we're going to be
talking to Eve Stanley

03:46.535 --> 03:48.503
who, at just the age of 14

03:48.537 --> 03:50.372
and with her younger sister
in tow,

03:50.405 --> 03:52.742
escaped from what she calls
a dangerous cult

03:52.775 --> 03:54.476
of radical thinking.

03:54.509 --> 03:56.545
Can you tell me what
it's been like transi...

04:13.528 --> 04:16.498
You're very late.

04:16.531 --> 04:18.067
I overslept.

04:18.100 --> 04:20.770
Well, come in.

04:20.803 --> 04:23.739
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, come on.

04:27.844 --> 04:29.145
Robin's around here somewhere.

04:29.178 --> 04:31.546
She's been asking
where you were.

04:31.581 --> 04:33.716
Hey, Shane,
your brother is here.

04:33.749 --> 04:35.651
Okay, one sec.

04:35.685 --> 04:38.054
You don't have to work tonight,
do you?

04:38.087 --> 04:40.422
Uh, no, actually.

04:40.455 --> 04:43.525
Do you want something to drink?
Or we have cake left over.

04:43.558 --> 04:45.127
Um, sure.

04:45.161 --> 04:47.562
I'll just take a drink.

04:49.464 --> 04:50.900
I'm not on call tonight.

04:50.933 --> 04:53.568
I have to change some locks
in an apartment complex

04:53.603 --> 04:55.437
- sometime tomorrow.
- Great.

05:06.448 --> 05:08.584
Robin, get in here!

05:14.056 --> 05:16.926
Honey, did you break this?

05:19.095 --> 05:21.898
- Say hi to your uncle.
- Hi.

05:21.931 --> 05:24.800
Honey, you have to tell me
when you do something like this.

05:24.834 --> 05:26.534
- It's very dangerous.
- How are you?

05:26.568 --> 05:29.537
- Whoa, what'd you break?
- I didn't, I was in my room.

05:29.571 --> 05:30.973
Hey, honey, leave it,
I'll get a broom.

05:31.007 --> 05:31.908
Hey, did you work tonight?

05:31.941 --> 05:33.943
Mom, are you gonna help
me with my homework?

05:33.976 --> 05:36.012
Robin, honey, wait.

05:36.045 --> 05:38.581
Uh, no.

05:38.614 --> 05:40.650
Okay, well, you want some cake?

05:41.817 --> 05:43.686
No, I'm okay.

05:43.719 --> 05:44.887
Sure?

05:44.921 --> 05:46.656
It's good.

05:50.826 --> 05:52.595
You can always exchange it

05:52.628 --> 05:55.698
if you already have one.

05:55.731 --> 05:56.999
What's that?

05:57.033 --> 05:58.466
The flashlight.

05:58.500 --> 06:00.670
Oh, no, I...
I don't have a nice one.

06:00.703 --> 06:03.205
Robin picked it out.

06:03.239 --> 06:04.907
When she heard
you worked nights,

06:04.941 --> 06:08.010
she was very concerned with you
getting lost in the dark.

06:08.044 --> 06:08.911
- Huh.
- And hey,

06:08.945 --> 06:12.715
I know we missed your birthday,
but, um...

06:12.748 --> 06:16.518
I figured tonight would be
a good time to give it to you.

06:16.551 --> 06:19.922
I mean, it's just from my store,
so if you want something else...

06:19.956 --> 06:21.624
No, I'm definitely
gonna keep it.

06:31.566 --> 06:33.636
But, uh...

06:33.669 --> 06:35.537
Hey, you should open this now.

06:37.707 --> 06:38.908
Easy there, buddy.

06:41.077 --> 06:44.880
Uh, it's not like...
I didn't buy anything.

06:44.914 --> 06:47.883
I found it in the back
of my closet.

06:51.120 --> 06:54.123
From that board game
we used to play growing up.

06:54.156 --> 06:57.559
That was your piece.

06:57.593 --> 06:59.996
I still have mine
back at home too.

07:00.029 --> 07:01.797
That's sweet.

07:01.831 --> 07:04.600
Well, what happened
to the rest of the game?

07:04.633 --> 07:06.769
I think it got lost in the move.

07:06.802 --> 07:10.239
Well, we kinda need the rest
of the game though, right?

07:10.272 --> 07:11.207
Oh, yeah.

07:11.240 --> 07:14.710
I just thought it would be
cool to have it.

07:14.744 --> 07:16.912
Mom,

07:16.946 --> 07:19.281
what time is it?

07:19.315 --> 07:22.251
It's very late, honey.

07:22.284 --> 07:23.819
I'll take her up.

07:23.853 --> 07:25.321
Come here, sweetheart.

07:25.354 --> 07:27.289
All right, here we go.

07:27.323 --> 07:31.093
All right, let's get you to bed.

07:37.733 --> 07:40.236
Okay, folks, now,
sometimes we get articles

07:40.269 --> 07:43.305
coming to the club that are
sometimes fun and extravagant.

07:43.339 --> 07:45.107
Well, we have something
coming up next

07:45.141 --> 07:47.009
that has to do with your health.

07:47.043 --> 07:48.644
This is very important.

07:48.677 --> 07:50.713
Now, do you know someone
in your family

07:50.746 --> 07:53.716
that needs to watch their pulse
or their blood pressure?

07:53.749 --> 07:56.318
It's something that's
very, very important to do.

07:56.352 --> 07:57.920
We have, back again...

10:46.088 --> 10:47.356
Hello?

10:47.389 --> 10:49.792
Uh, hi, Lynn, it's Ethan.

10:49.825 --> 10:52.228
Ethan? What's wrong?

10:52.261 --> 10:54.430
Uh, nothing, sorry.

10:54.463 --> 10:56.298
I thought I called
Shane's phone.

10:56.332 --> 10:57.499
Is he there?

10:57.533 --> 10:59.134
Yeah, he's sleeping.

10:59.168 --> 11:00.436
We're both sleeping.

11:00.469 --> 11:01.837
What's going on?

11:01.870 --> 11:03.339
I...

11:03.372 --> 11:06.108
just found something.

11:06.141 --> 11:07.810
I really think he'd like it.

11:07.843 --> 11:10.145
I was thinking
he could come out and see it.

11:10.179 --> 11:13.148
Ethan, it's four o'clock
in the morning.

11:13.182 --> 11:16.018
Oh, right, sorry,
I know, it's...

11:18.187 --> 11:22.157
It's just, I've never seen
anything like it. I thought he...

11:22.191 --> 11:25.327
I'm sure you can show him
whatever it is tomorrow.

11:25.361 --> 11:28.197
- Well, I really can't...
- Good night, Ethan.

11:30.366 --> 11:32.268
I can't just...

13:53.275 --> 13:56.412
Listen, I ain't gonna sugarcoat
this for you, folks.

13:56.445 --> 13:58.480
Our days on this earth
are numbered.

13:58.514 --> 14:01.183
All you have to do
is walk down the street

14:01.216 --> 14:02.585
or turn your television on

14:02.619 --> 14:05.254
to see that we are living
in the last days.

14:05.287 --> 14:07.590
Make yourself right with God.

14:16.532 --> 14:18.066
Hey, this is Shane Daunes.

14:18.100 --> 14:20.068
I can't get to the phone
right now,

14:20.102 --> 14:21.437
but if you'll leave
your name and...

17:11.306 --> 17:13.241
Hey, I couldn't get you
on your phone.

17:14.644 --> 17:17.512
I forget it in
my glove compartment sometimes.

17:17.546 --> 17:19.147
Right, uh, hey,

17:19.181 --> 17:22.585
there was something
that I wanted you to come see.

17:24.386 --> 17:25.688
Well, where is it?

17:25.722 --> 17:27.824
It's back at my place.

17:30.559 --> 17:32.461
Well, what is it?

17:32.494 --> 17:34.529
It's... I don't even know.

17:34.563 --> 17:36.398
You just gotta see it.

17:36.431 --> 17:39.836
Okay, well, I can't right now.

17:39.869 --> 17:41.503
Well, it's not gonna take long.

17:41.536 --> 17:44.239
I could give you a lift over.

17:48.510 --> 17:51.781
Well, hey, dude, uh,
did Lynn get in touch with you?

17:51.814 --> 17:53.382
Uh, no.

17:53.415 --> 17:55.484
Why?

17:55.517 --> 17:57.486
We were just gonna see
if you wouldn't mind

17:57.519 --> 18:01.423
watching Robin tomorrow,
just for the evening,

18:01.456 --> 18:04.827
'cause we're supposed to go see
Lynn's, uh, cousin's wedding,

18:04.861 --> 18:06.461
Eric.

18:06.495 --> 18:08.631
It's all the way out in Dover,

18:08.665 --> 18:10.733
and Christina called
this morning and said

18:10.767 --> 18:12.869
she wasn't gonna be able
to make it,

18:12.902 --> 18:16.204
probably for some reason
she made up.

18:16.238 --> 18:18.841
You don't work, do you?

18:18.875 --> 18:20.610
No.

18:20.643 --> 18:24.379
I've never really taken care
of her before.

18:24.413 --> 18:27.950
Well, it's not that hard,
I mean, she loves you.

18:27.984 --> 18:30.953
Yeah...

18:30.987 --> 18:33.723
Look, it's just one night.

18:33.756 --> 18:35.858
It'd really mean a lot to us.

18:39.862 --> 18:41.597
Okay, yeah.

18:43.398 --> 18:45.702
Well, can you show me
whatever it is

18:45.735 --> 18:47.235
when I pick her up?

18:47.269 --> 18:48.503
Yeah, sure.

18:48.537 --> 18:50.372
All right, great.

18:56.579 --> 18:59.716
Oh, hey, uh, did you hear?

18:59.749 --> 19:02.317
Connie's back in town, visiting.

19:02.350 --> 19:04.286
We were gonna try
to get together with her

19:04.319 --> 19:07.289
while she's here,
if you want to see her.

19:07.322 --> 19:11.594
Uh, yeah, I don't know.

19:11.627 --> 19:14.563
Okay, just let me know.

21:01.170 --> 21:02.839
Hey!

21:05.141 --> 21:07.109
What are you doin' out here?

21:07.143 --> 21:10.713
Uh, nothing,
I was just looking around.

21:10.746 --> 21:12.882
It's the middle of the night.

21:17.485 --> 21:19.487
Why are you trying
to get in there?

21:19.521 --> 21:20.723
I don't know.

21:20.756 --> 21:22.925
I've seen you creeping around
out here.

21:22.959 --> 21:25.127
You can't do that,
this is my private property.

21:25.161 --> 21:27.129
Whatever, you rent this out
from my dad.

21:27.163 --> 21:29.999
All right,
would you just go home?

21:30.032 --> 21:31.433
Yeah, fine.

21:40.542 --> 21:41.644
Hello?

21:41.677 --> 21:44.981
Mike, uh, I don't think
I can be on call tonight.

21:45.014 --> 21:47.083
Um, I'm not really feeling well.

21:47.116 --> 21:49.585
Oh, uh... all right.

21:49.619 --> 21:51.888
I'll see if Brody
can cover for you.

21:51.921 --> 21:54.489
I'm sure he'd like
something to do.

21:54.522 --> 21:56.826
Okay, sorry.

23:29.285 --> 23:31.887
Do you do good in school?

23:31.921 --> 23:34.023
Yeah.

23:34.056 --> 23:36.558
I used to always have to help
your dad with his math

23:36.592 --> 23:39.095
'cause I was older.

23:39.128 --> 23:42.064
I was really bad at math.

23:42.098 --> 23:44.532
So, he used to always get
in trouble

23:44.566 --> 23:46.802
because I'd teach him
everything wrong.

23:46.836 --> 23:47.970
Really?

23:49.605 --> 23:50.572
Yeah.

23:51.340 --> 23:52.875
Oh, wow.

23:52.908 --> 23:54.310
That's funny.

23:56.712 --> 23:58.881
So, your dad, he works a lot.

23:58.914 --> 24:02.318
Like, do you ever get to spend
any time with him?

24:02.351 --> 24:04.854
Um, yeah.

24:04.887 --> 24:06.322
When he gets home every day,

24:06.355 --> 24:08.190
we play a game or something,

24:08.224 --> 24:10.059
like go on a walk.

24:12.328 --> 24:15.264
Hey, finish up.
I want to show you something.

24:25.207 --> 24:27.309
Your dad ever take you
down here?

24:29.645 --> 24:32.181
Um, I don't think so.

24:49.632 --> 24:51.834
- You see that house over there?
- Yeah.

24:51.867 --> 24:55.838
Your dad and I grew up there,

24:55.871 --> 24:58.074
when we were your age,

24:58.107 --> 25:01.277
till I was 13 and he was 12.

25:01.310 --> 25:02.778
Really?

25:04.814 --> 25:07.850
Yeah.

25:07.883 --> 25:10.619
One day I'm gonna move
back in there.

25:11.921 --> 25:14.924
Does someone else live
in there now?

25:14.957 --> 25:17.626
Uh, no.

25:17.660 --> 25:20.696
Not for a while now.

25:20.729 --> 25:23.365
So why can't you just go back?

25:26.001 --> 25:30.372
Uh, I mean, I'm working on it.

25:30.406 --> 25:33.309
Just trying to save up
some money.

26:18.320 --> 26:20.089
Hello?

26:20.122 --> 26:23.292
Hey, Ethan?

26:23.325 --> 26:26.262
It's... Connie.

26:26.295 --> 26:28.430
Sorry if I woke you up.

26:28.464 --> 26:30.199
N-no, it's fine.

26:30.232 --> 26:33.002
Um, how've you been?

26:33.035 --> 26:35.404
Good, um, pretty good.

26:35.437 --> 26:36.772
Thanks.

26:36.805 --> 26:40.276
I, um, actually just got
into town, just...

26:40.309 --> 26:42.011
just for the week.

26:42.044 --> 26:45.881
I hope it's okay,
I got your number from Lynn.

26:45.915 --> 26:48.050
I just thought
I'd give you a call

26:48.083 --> 26:52.254
and see if you wanted
to get together while I'm here.

26:52.288 --> 26:56.025
- Okay.
- I'm here visiting my grandma,

26:56.058 --> 26:58.794
but other than that,
I'm pretty free.

26:58.827 --> 27:00.296
We should catch up.

27:00.329 --> 27:01.797
All right.

27:01.830 --> 27:03.499
Great.

27:03.532 --> 27:06.368
Well, just give me
a call whenever.

27:06.402 --> 27:08.771
We can figure something out.

27:10.005 --> 27:12.408
Okay, bye.

30:12.020 --> 30:13.088
Dad!

30:14.289 --> 30:16.659
Hey!

30:16.693 --> 30:18.595
- Did you miss me?
- Yeah.

30:18.628 --> 30:19.662
Yeah?

30:19.696 --> 30:21.530
Take care of this guy for me?

30:21.563 --> 30:22.665
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

30:27.302 --> 30:29.706
- Did you have a good time?
- Uh, yeah.

30:29.739 --> 30:31.173
That's good.

30:31.206 --> 30:32.941
Was the wedding pretty?

30:32.975 --> 30:34.309
It was long.

30:34.343 --> 30:36.378
- But, hey, we got you something.
- You did?

30:36.412 --> 30:40.015
- Yeah, go look in the truck.
- Okay.

30:40.048 --> 30:42.284
Hey, thanks again, man.

30:42.317 --> 30:44.353
Yeah, no problem.

30:47.456 --> 30:50.660
Hey, what's going on over there?

30:56.331 --> 30:58.400
Uh... I don't know.

31:00.335 --> 31:04.573
Oh, what was it
you wanted to show me?

31:04.607 --> 31:06.575
Uh, it's nothing.

31:06.609 --> 31:09.077
You sure? You seemed
pretty excited about it.

31:14.483 --> 31:16.485
All right, well,

31:16.518 --> 31:18.353
I'll see ya.

31:21.691 --> 31:24.393
- Ethan?
- Yeah, I'm here.

31:24.426 --> 31:26.295
Feeling any better?

31:26.328 --> 31:28.631
What? Uh, yeah.

31:28.665 --> 31:30.065
I'm... I'm good.

31:30.098 --> 31:33.035
Good, I got a commercial lockout
for you.

31:33.068 --> 31:35.638
510 Slane Road.

32:28.123 --> 32:30.292
You Ethan?

32:30.325 --> 32:31.360
Yeah.

32:31.393 --> 32:32.795
Okay, where're you goin'?

32:32.829 --> 32:33.796
What?

32:33.830 --> 32:35.732
Where're you driving to?

32:35.765 --> 32:36.833
I'm going to work.

32:36.866 --> 32:40.369
You know the kid who lives
next-door to you, Alex?

32:40.402 --> 32:41.270
Yeah.

32:41.303 --> 32:43.572
When's the last time
you seen him?

32:43.606 --> 32:46.308
W-why? Is everything okay?

32:46.341 --> 32:49.846
Yeah. When's the last time
you seen him?

32:49.879 --> 32:53.750
Last night, or last... afternoon.

32:53.783 --> 32:56.385
When I got home,
he was riding his bike.

32:56.418 --> 32:57.787
And what time was that?

32:57.820 --> 33:00.823
I don't know,
it was before five.

33:00.857 --> 33:02.391
Yeah.

33:04.259 --> 33:05.427
You're a locksmith?

33:05.460 --> 33:07.296
Is that a lonely job,

33:07.329 --> 33:10.600
driving around in the dark?

33:10.633 --> 33:13.135
You got any family
who lives with you?

33:13.168 --> 33:14.871
No, I don't.

33:14.904 --> 33:17.539
No one else in your house?

33:17.573 --> 33:19.408
Look, I need to go to work.

33:20.610 --> 33:22.177
Please.

33:24.714 --> 33:26.649
All right, don't go far.

33:27.382 --> 33:29.819
In case we need to reach you.

33:39.696 --> 33:41.898
Hey!

33:41.931 --> 33:43.666
Thank God.

33:45.802 --> 33:47.770
Are you Aaron?

33:47.804 --> 33:49.538
Yeah.

33:49.571 --> 33:52.140
Which door?

33:52.174 --> 33:53.408
Any.

33:53.442 --> 33:55.143
Front door, I guess.

33:55.177 --> 33:58.748
There's three doors,
and they're all locked.

34:05.253 --> 34:08.123
Hey, uh, how long do you think
this is gonna take?

34:09.291 --> 34:11.293
Just a minute.

34:11.326 --> 34:13.161
Cool, cool.

34:13.195 --> 34:16.431
Uh, 'cause the parents get
pretty pissy when they get here

34:16.465 --> 34:18.467
and we're not open yet.

34:36.518 --> 34:39.454
Do the kids play out there,
by the woods?

34:39.488 --> 34:43.325
Oh, sure, anywhere they can roll
around in some dirt.

35:04.413 --> 35:06.248
Authorities have called off
the search

35:06.281 --> 35:07.850
for a local missing teen.

35:07.884 --> 35:10.987
Alex Birman was reported missing
from his family home

35:11.020 --> 35:12.088
last Tuesday.

35:12.121 --> 35:15.625
More than 80 volunteers,
a search and rescue team,

35:15.658 --> 35:18.695
and a K-9 unit helped
in the efforts to find him.

35:33.508 --> 35:35.510
One second, hold on,
I'm coming.

35:37.980 --> 35:39.514
Hey, man, what's up?

35:39.548 --> 35:42.517
Sorry, I didn't hear you knock.

35:42.551 --> 35:45.621
Come on, it's in the car.

35:45.655 --> 35:48.758
Uh, Walter, my dog,

35:48.791 --> 35:50.893
usually goes crazy
when someone's at the door,

35:50.927 --> 35:55.363
so that's... that's my indication
that someone's here.

35:55.397 --> 35:59.434
And, uh, I'm pretty sure my ex
came back and probably took him.

35:59.468 --> 36:03.005
So, now I'm twice as lonely.

36:09.946 --> 36:12.715
Those are already keyed,
all five of 'em.

36:12.749 --> 36:15.585
Well, thanks for doing this.

36:15.618 --> 36:18.487
And, well, thanks for covering
my shift last week too.

36:18.520 --> 36:19.488
Yeah, no problem.

36:19.521 --> 36:21.456
The, uh, the key's in there.

36:21.490 --> 36:24.326
I didn't make any copies
'cause I didn't know

36:24.359 --> 36:26.328
how many you needed.

36:26.361 --> 36:28.396
No, this is fine.

36:30.332 --> 36:32.835
Hey, uh,
you doing anything tonight?

36:32.869 --> 36:35.370
I was just gonna go to, like,
a bar or something.

36:35.403 --> 36:36.973
- I didn't know...
- My brother invited me

36:37.006 --> 36:38.841
for dinner,
I'm headed there now.

36:38.875 --> 36:40.342
- Oh, okay.
- So...

36:40.375 --> 36:43.012
Maybe, uh, maybe next time
we can do something.

36:43.045 --> 36:44.479
Yeah.

36:47.415 --> 36:51.587
And if... if you ever need
anything, you know, whatever,

36:51.621 --> 36:53.689
just let me know.

36:53.723 --> 36:57.894
I'm usually bored
most of the time, so.

36:57.927 --> 37:00.863
- Yeah, I'll let you know.
- Okay, cool.

37:00.897 --> 37:02.965
I'll see you then.

37:23.385 --> 37:25.054
Come in.

37:31.060 --> 37:32.427
Hey.

37:32.460 --> 37:34.831
Whose car's out there?

37:41.671 --> 37:43.371
It's been just insane.

37:43.405 --> 37:45.908
Seems like I picked
a bad time to come back.

37:45.942 --> 37:49.411
Yeah, I don't even want to let
Robin play in the backyard

37:49.444 --> 37:51.647
without me being there
to watch her.

37:51.681 --> 37:54.650
It's just one more reason
why we're...

37:54.684 --> 37:58.020
Well, I don't know.

37:58.054 --> 37:59.689
They don't have any idea
who it is?

37:59.722 --> 38:01.691
When it was just
the Birman kid,

38:01.724 --> 38:03.693
some guys were saying
it was his dad,

38:03.726 --> 38:05.728
'cause he's a little off

38:05.761 --> 38:07.930
and the mother's
out of the picture.

38:07.964 --> 38:12.902
But, I mean, there's been, like,
five people missing since then,

38:12.935 --> 38:14.904
or found dead,

38:14.937 --> 38:16.906
and it's pretty violent stuff.

38:16.939 --> 38:18.741
What do you mean?

38:18.774 --> 38:22.044
Well, I got my one friend
who's a cop,

38:22.078 --> 38:24.013
and he said that, uh, Mitch,

38:24.046 --> 38:27.850
who me and Ethan
used to know growing up,

38:27.884 --> 38:32.655
they found him in his car,
in his driveway.

38:32.688 --> 38:35.124
It was a pretty gory scene,
is what he said.

38:35.157 --> 38:36.359
Oh my God.

38:36.391 --> 38:39.595
I just can't believe
it's happening here, you know?

38:39.629 --> 38:42.497
That someone in this town
could do something like that.

38:42.530 --> 38:44.767
I keep telling Ethan,
you better be careful.

38:44.800 --> 38:46.903
Yeah, Jesus.

38:46.936 --> 38:48.971
I mean, you do live alone

38:49.005 --> 38:53.142
and kinda got a...
axe murderer look going on.

38:54.644 --> 38:56.145
I don't know,
maybe you might wanna...

38:56.178 --> 38:57.847
Shane!

38:57.880 --> 39:00.016
That's horrible.

39:00.049 --> 39:01.584
He's kidding.

39:10.525 --> 39:13.029
I'll... be right back.

39:18.500 --> 39:21.170
I don't understand why you
always have to do it like that.

39:21.203 --> 39:23.005
- It's fine.
- No...

39:52.234 --> 39:55.805
I'll be right back.
Do you guys need anything?

39:58.140 --> 39:59.175
Hey.

40:02.111 --> 40:03.511
You all right?

40:04.146 --> 40:06.582
Uh, yeah. Fine.

40:13.122 --> 40:14.757
Hey, listen, um...

40:17.259 --> 40:21.230
You guys sell a lot
of security cameras, right?

40:21.263 --> 40:24.166
I mean, like, you know
how to install 'em?

40:24.200 --> 40:26.168
Uh, yeah.

40:26.202 --> 40:28.104
Okay, good, good,
'cause I'm thinking

40:28.137 --> 40:32.208
about putting some up here
around the house.

40:32.241 --> 40:34.944
Is that weird?

40:34.977 --> 40:38.581
I mean, people do that, right?

40:38.614 --> 40:42.218
I've done a few houses.

40:42.251 --> 40:44.720
Is there a reason?

40:44.754 --> 40:47.123
I don't know, I just, uh...

40:47.156 --> 40:51.894
Maybe with everything that's
been going on here lately, I...

40:51.927 --> 40:55.297
I'm getting to feel
a little paranoid.

40:55.331 --> 40:58.566
You have the security alarm
system here.

40:58.601 --> 41:01.904
No, I mean, yeah, you're right,
it's just, uh...

41:03.773 --> 41:07.610
Look, I'm probably
making this up, but...

41:07.643 --> 41:10.212
the other night,

41:10.246 --> 41:13.616
I woke up and I swear
I heard someone

41:13.649 --> 41:17.119
walking around and moving
out in the backyard.

41:18.988 --> 41:21.290
And I didn't see anyone,

41:21.323 --> 41:25.327
but I just felt, like,
freaked out.

41:25.361 --> 41:28.631
I didn't tell Lynn or anything,

41:28.664 --> 41:31.100
but it's just been on my mind,

41:31.133 --> 41:34.837
and I just thought, you know,
if we have a camera out there,

41:34.870 --> 41:39.975
and since you do that anyways,
it'd be...

41:40.009 --> 41:41.977
Yeah.

41:42.011 --> 41:44.613
Yeah, I can do it.

41:44.647 --> 41:46.182
Okay.

41:50.386 --> 41:54.090
Look, uh...

41:54.123 --> 41:58.961
Connie asked us
to invite you here tonight.

41:58.994 --> 42:00.963
I'm just saying.

42:02.431 --> 42:04.733
Her whole class went
on a nature walk

42:04.767 --> 42:06.001
and had a picnic there.

42:06.035 --> 42:08.104
Robin's been begging me
to take her back,

42:08.137 --> 42:09.972
but with everything
that's going on,

42:10.005 --> 42:11.340
I just don't feel comfortable.

42:11.373 --> 42:14.143
Uh, hey, I'm gonna take off.

42:14.176 --> 42:15.711
What?

42:17.379 --> 42:19.682
It was good seeing you.

45:00.442 --> 45:02.811
Hey! Stop!

45:06.248 --> 45:08.984
What the fuck are you doing?

45:13.455 --> 45:16.593
You're... you're that cop.

45:24.066 --> 45:25.834
I'm a friend
of the Birman family.

45:25.868 --> 45:26.902
- What?
- They're all real worried

45:26.935 --> 45:28.904
about Alex, they just want
to see him back home.

45:28.937 --> 45:31.073
I told you, I don't know
what happened to him, okay?

45:31.106 --> 45:32.141
Yeah, I don't believe you,

45:32.174 --> 45:34.209
'cause I can look someone
in the eye and tell

45:34.243 --> 45:36.613
when they're being straight
with me or lying to my face.

45:36.646 --> 45:38.881
This is... this is not okay,

45:38.914 --> 45:40.382
what... what you're doing
right now.

45:40.416 --> 45:41.950
No, no, I don't care
what you think.

45:41.984 --> 45:43.218
I don't give a shit,

45:43.252 --> 45:45.020
'cause I've been keeping
my eye on you,

45:45.054 --> 45:46.589
and you're a real freak.

45:46.623 --> 45:48.424
You're a real piece of work.

45:50.526 --> 45:52.995
No, all right, I'm...
I'm leaving.

45:53.028 --> 45:54.631
Oh, I'm not gonna stop you,

45:54.664 --> 45:57.600
but the next time I see you,
I ain't gonna be alone,

45:57.634 --> 46:01.003
and I promise you, you'll have
some answers for me then.

46:02.304 --> 46:04.039
Hey, are you listening to me?

46:04.073 --> 46:06.875
I'm about one second from taking
that flashlight out of your hand

46:06.909 --> 46:08.077
and bashing in your fucking...

47:26.689 --> 47:29.224
Sorry to just show up.

47:29.258 --> 47:32.327
I just knew I'd regret it
if I didn't get a chance

47:32.361 --> 47:34.563
to talk to you
while I was here.

47:34.597 --> 47:36.965
Yeah, I was gonna call you
and then...

47:39.501 --> 47:41.738
Can I ask you something?

47:41.771 --> 47:45.474
Did you ever regret
not leaving with me?

47:50.647 --> 47:54.283
Yeah, I think I did, back then.

47:54.316 --> 47:56.686
I always kinda thought
you'd make it outta here,

47:56.719 --> 47:59.521
eventually.

47:59.555 --> 48:04.059
But you never left?

48:04.092 --> 48:06.562
Uh... no.

48:06.596 --> 48:11.133
What's been keeping you here
all this time?

48:11.166 --> 48:13.168
I don't know.

48:13.202 --> 48:16.138
I got a lot
of good memories here.

48:17.072 --> 48:19.308
I think you stay
in one place too long

48:19.341 --> 48:21.243
and you'll get yourself
mixed up with it,

48:21.276 --> 48:24.446
then you have no choice
but to just... get out.

48:24.480 --> 48:26.548
Some problems can't follow you.

48:26.583 --> 48:28.751
They're rooted in a place.

48:28.785 --> 48:31.688
I don't think
I can outrun my problems.

48:33.055 --> 48:35.157
But you haven't tried?

49:00.750 --> 49:02.551
I'm sorry.

49:02.585 --> 49:04.186
There was a spider.

49:04.219 --> 49:05.788
No, it's okay.

49:08.490 --> 49:10.259
I'm not scared of spiders.

49:10.292 --> 49:12.528
I'm not like, um...

49:12.561 --> 49:14.496
It just startled me.

49:16.398 --> 49:18.100
Do you have a broom?

49:18.133 --> 49:20.168
No, I'll get it.

49:23.305 --> 49:24.674
Oh, wow.

49:24.707 --> 49:26.275
You found it.

49:26.308 --> 49:28.343
Here, let me get out of the way.

49:43.559 --> 49:45.527
This is weird to see.

49:47.664 --> 49:50.132
You don't have yours?

49:50.165 --> 49:52.334
No.

49:52.367 --> 49:54.436
I lost mine years ago.

50:08.283 --> 50:11.253
Ethan, I want to help you.

50:12.622 --> 50:15.557
What?

50:15.592 --> 50:18.628
Most of the people
I haven't seen in ten years,

50:18.661 --> 50:21.163
I just forget
they exist entirely,

50:21.196 --> 50:24.366
but you've always
sort of stayed on my mind,

50:24.399 --> 50:28.236
and being back here,
seeing you like this,

50:28.270 --> 50:31.139
I, uh, I feel bad
for leaving you here.

50:34.443 --> 50:36.545
I leave tomorrow at two.

50:36.579 --> 50:38.447
Just come with me.

50:38.480 --> 50:40.315
Just for a bit,

50:40.349 --> 50:42.317
to see what's out there for you

50:42.351 --> 50:46.154
and to forget about this place
for a while.

50:46.188 --> 50:49.157
What do... where?

50:49.191 --> 50:50.727
Wherever.

50:50.760 --> 50:52.729
Outta here.

50:59.836 --> 51:03.940
I think if you stay here
one more day,

51:03.973 --> 51:06.274
you'll never get out.

1:00:55.364 --> 1:00:57.299
No! No.

1:02:31.293 --> 1:02:33.128
What is it?

1:04:39.488 --> 1:04:42.991
Sorry 'bout that.

1:04:44.126 --> 1:04:46.495
It's fine.

1:04:58.340 --> 1:04:59.575
Thanks for the ride.

1:04:59.609 --> 1:05:01.611
Hope it wasn't
too far out of the way.

1:05:01.644 --> 1:05:04.012
No worries.

1:05:04.046 --> 1:05:06.683
I'm happy to help.

1:05:11.320 --> 1:05:15.692
So what are you doing
out here?

1:05:15.725 --> 1:05:20.229
Uh... just going for
a walk in the woods.

1:05:20.262 --> 1:05:24.601
Got turned around,
came out here.

1:05:24.634 --> 1:05:27.302
You do a lot of hiking?

1:05:27.336 --> 1:05:28.470
No.

1:05:43.820 --> 1:05:44.687
Is it on?

1:05:44.721 --> 1:05:47.389
No. Wait...

1:05:47.422 --> 1:05:51.226
Uh... yeah, there you go.

1:05:51.260 --> 1:05:55.063
You can click on the window
if you wanna zoom.

1:05:55.097 --> 1:05:57.634
Or you might have to use
the numbers.

1:05:57.667 --> 1:06:00.670
Okay. Well, it looks great.

1:06:00.703 --> 1:06:02.739
Hey, uh,
are you working tonight?

1:06:05.875 --> 1:06:07.543
Uh, no.

1:06:07.576 --> 1:06:09.612
What's up?

1:06:09.646 --> 1:06:13.650
Well... I'm gonna be
meeting up with some people

1:06:13.683 --> 1:06:15.450
later this evening,

1:06:15.484 --> 1:06:18.655
and I think you should come.

1:06:18.688 --> 1:06:20.289
Think it'd be good.

1:06:22.257 --> 1:06:24.159
Okay, yeah.

1:06:24.192 --> 1:06:25.327
All right. Well, listen,

1:06:25.360 --> 1:06:27.864
just don't mention it
to Lynn, okay?

1:06:27.897 --> 1:06:29.197
'Cause I just told her
it was you and I

1:06:29.231 --> 1:06:30.667
hanging out tonight.

1:06:31.801 --> 1:06:33.770
Sure.

1:06:33.803 --> 1:06:35.137
All right.

1:06:38.206 --> 1:06:39.742
Hey, Mike, it's Ethan.

1:06:39.776 --> 1:06:44.413
You don't have me on call
for tonight, do you?

1:06:44.446 --> 1:06:47.750
Uh, yes I do. Why?

1:06:47.784 --> 1:06:50.519
Shit. Um...

1:06:50.552 --> 1:06:54.189
I don't think I'm gonna be able
to make it.

1:06:54.222 --> 1:06:58.427
Or at least,
I can't come in till later.

1:06:58.460 --> 1:07:00.262
Ethan?

1:07:00.295 --> 1:07:03.600
You agreed to this schedule.

1:07:03.633 --> 1:07:06.268
You're not even gonna
give me a reason?

1:07:06.301 --> 1:07:08.537
I don't know yet.

1:07:08.570 --> 1:07:10.205
Goddammit.

1:07:10.238 --> 1:07:12.709
You know, I gave you this job
because your brother was

1:07:12.742 --> 1:07:14.777
always a hard worker.

1:07:14.811 --> 1:07:16.578
I consider him a friend.

1:07:16.613 --> 1:07:18.280
But time after time,

1:07:18.313 --> 1:07:20.315
you keep coming up short.

1:07:20.349 --> 1:07:22.250
And worse than that,

1:07:22.284 --> 1:07:25.454
you don't take responsibility
for shit.

1:07:25.487 --> 1:07:29.358
I'm... I'm not gonna be able
to use you anymore.

1:07:29.391 --> 1:07:32.227
Get the van back to me
this week.

1:07:33.696 --> 1:07:35.497
Ethan?

1:07:35.530 --> 1:07:37.432
Did you hear me?

1:07:37.466 --> 1:07:41.503
Yeah. Don't mention this
to Shane, okay?

1:08:23.680 --> 1:08:25.648
Oh, hey, guys,
come on in.

1:08:29.952 --> 1:08:32.421
It's like the third one.

1:08:32.454 --> 1:08:34.691
What's going on, man,
how you doing?

1:08:34.724 --> 1:08:35.858
What's going on?

1:08:38.995 --> 1:08:40.295
You've gotta figure out
how to stop the bleeding

1:08:40.328 --> 1:08:42.564
really fast.

1:08:49.639 --> 1:08:52.340
They just found Nathan Ridgemore
on the side of the highway.

1:08:52.374 --> 1:08:54.576
What?

1:08:54.610 --> 1:08:56.411
Jesus Christ.

1:08:56.445 --> 1:08:58.480
That makes eight dead or missing
in less than a week.

1:08:58.513 --> 1:08:59.816
This is ridiculous.

1:08:59.849 --> 1:09:01.017
We should be out there
busting heads,

1:09:01.050 --> 1:09:02.284
getting some answers.

1:09:02.317 --> 1:09:04.319
Well, that's why we're here,
to figure out what to do.

1:09:05.520 --> 1:09:06.589
We know what we gotta do,

1:09:06.622 --> 1:09:07.857
just no one's wanting
to say it.

1:09:11.661 --> 1:09:13.930
And what's that?

1:09:13.963 --> 1:09:16.899
Only a certain kind of person's
out there doing this, right?

1:09:16.933 --> 1:09:19.367
We're not talking about
a normal guy here,

1:09:19.401 --> 1:09:21.871
we're talking about
a sick bastard.

1:09:21.904 --> 1:09:24.807
Each of us knows someone
who's a little...

1:09:24.841 --> 1:09:27.944
so I say, we start giving
those people a visit,

1:09:27.977 --> 1:09:29.645
narrowing down the pool.

1:09:29.679 --> 1:09:33.348
No. You just can't start
pinning down random people.

1:09:33.381 --> 1:09:34.617
Be honest.

1:09:34.650 --> 1:09:37.920
Sheriff and all y'all are in
way over your heads out there.

1:09:37.954 --> 1:09:39.756
No, that's not true.

1:09:39.789 --> 1:09:41.591
It's just, this isn't
like anything we've ever

1:09:41.624 --> 1:09:43.025
dealt with before.

1:09:43.059 --> 1:09:45.360
I mean, this is
real brutal stuff.

1:09:45.393 --> 1:09:46.294
All the more reason
we should be out here

1:09:46.328 --> 1:09:47.864
trying to find this guy now.

1:09:47.897 --> 1:09:49.098
Exactly. If we're not
doing something,

1:09:49.132 --> 1:09:52.567
then we're just waiting around
to see what happens next.

1:09:52.602 --> 1:09:56.571
Look, as much as I hate
to agree with Paul,

1:09:56.606 --> 1:09:58.540
I got... I got kids.

1:09:58.573 --> 1:09:59.809
I know you got a kid.

1:10:03.813 --> 1:10:06.348
We have an obligation
to protect our families.

1:10:09.852 --> 1:10:11.821
I bought a gun yesterday.

1:10:14.791 --> 1:10:15.858
A handgun.

1:10:17.593 --> 1:10:20.630
And I suggest every one of you
do the same thing.

1:10:20.663 --> 1:10:22.330
Well, I'm covered.

1:10:22.364 --> 1:10:23.866
I have a hunting rifle.

1:10:23.900 --> 1:10:25.534
That's fine.

1:10:25.567 --> 1:10:27.369
Yeah, I'm thinking about
getting something too.

1:10:27.402 --> 1:10:28.971
I say, do it.

1:10:29.005 --> 1:10:30.807
- Better safe.
- All right, look.

1:10:30.840 --> 1:10:32.507
If you wanna keep a gun
at your house,

1:10:32.541 --> 1:10:34.844
that's one thing,
and that's okay.

1:10:34.877 --> 1:10:36.378
If you wanna be a lookout
or whatever,

1:10:36.411 --> 1:10:37.914
that's all right too.

1:10:37.947 --> 1:10:39.048
And this doesn't mean
I'm advocating

1:10:39.081 --> 1:10:42.084
for sneaking around,
looking in someone's window.

1:10:42.118 --> 1:10:44.519
But if you do find something,

1:10:44.553 --> 1:10:46.689
give us a call
before you act on it.

1:10:46.722 --> 1:10:49.025
Yeah, well, it's not about
what to do with him.

1:10:49.058 --> 1:10:50.927
It's about finding him.

1:10:54.797 --> 1:10:57.499
Well, tell you what.

1:10:57.532 --> 1:10:59.702
This wasn't happening
when I grew up here.

1:10:59.735 --> 1:11:01.369
Wasn't happening a year ago.

1:11:01.403 --> 1:11:03.105
Wasn't happening last month.

1:11:03.139 --> 1:11:05.473
Something's changed.

1:11:05.507 --> 1:11:07.944
That's what we need
to be looking for.

1:11:07.977 --> 1:11:11.781
Who doesn't belong?

1:11:16.118 --> 1:11:18.020
Hey, Ethan.

1:11:18.054 --> 1:11:20.422
I've been trying to call you.

1:11:20.455 --> 1:11:21.824
I can't really wait
any longer,

1:11:21.858 --> 1:11:24.492
I gotta take off.

1:11:24.526 --> 1:11:28.064
I really wish
you coulda come with me.

1:11:28.097 --> 1:11:31.033
Where are you?

1:11:31.067 --> 1:11:33.069
I think you're missing out
on so many chances

1:11:33.102 --> 1:11:34.937
at something better,

1:11:34.971 --> 1:11:37.039
and most of them,
once they're gone,

1:11:37.073 --> 1:11:40.676
they don't ever
come back again.

1:11:40.710 --> 1:11:42.645
Goodbye, Ethan.

1:14:37.686 --> 1:14:38.954
Fuck!

1:15:33.876 --> 1:15:36.212
So what is it?

1:15:40.883 --> 1:15:43.252
That's out there now?

1:15:45.221 --> 1:15:47.723
Yeah.

1:15:47.756 --> 1:15:50.059
Oh, it's a lot bigger.

1:16:08.811 --> 1:16:10.446
So, uh...

1:16:10.479 --> 1:16:14.350
do you know
where it is now?

1:16:14.383 --> 1:16:16.185
No.

1:16:16.218 --> 1:16:21.190
Do you know the people
it's been killing?

1:16:24.393 --> 1:16:27.796
Everyone knows everyone
around here.

1:16:30.766 --> 1:16:33.469
Hmm...

1:16:33.502 --> 1:16:36.272
Where's the lye?

1:16:36.305 --> 1:16:38.374
Oh, shit.

1:16:38.407 --> 1:16:40.876
Left it in the truck,
hold on.

1:17:13.776 --> 1:17:15.811
Hey! You having some trouble?

1:17:15.844 --> 1:17:18.514
Oh, um... uh, no, I'm fine.

1:17:24.420 --> 1:17:26.222
What you doing out here?

1:17:31.560 --> 1:17:34.263
Hey! Stop!

1:17:39.568 --> 1:17:43.973
Hey! Sheriff's Department!
Stop!

1:17:44.006 --> 1:17:45.241
Get down on the ground!

1:17:45.274 --> 1:17:46.942
Show me your hands!

1:18:16.205 --> 1:18:18.841
You have reached
the voicemail box of...

1:18:18.874 --> 1:18:21.076
Uh, Brody Capra.

1:18:21.110 --> 1:18:23.012
At the tone,
please record...

1:18:32.388 --> 1:18:36.358
Mom let me stay home
from school today.

1:18:36.392 --> 1:18:37.993
Oh yeah?

1:18:38.027 --> 1:18:41.130
Why is that?

1:18:41.163 --> 1:18:45.334
I don't know.
Just for fun, I guess.

1:18:49.138 --> 1:18:51.507
That's nice.

1:18:51.540 --> 1:18:52.875
Yeah.

1:18:58.447 --> 1:19:00.115
What's that?

1:19:01.550 --> 1:19:04.453
Uh, these are trees.

1:19:04.486 --> 1:19:08.857
It looks kinda scary.

1:19:11.460 --> 1:19:13.329
What about you?
Are you done?

1:19:13.362 --> 1:19:14.496
Mm... okay.

1:19:22.037 --> 1:19:23.539
Hey.

1:19:23.572 --> 1:19:25.074
Can we talk to you?

1:19:31.080 --> 1:19:34.283
So we got some good news,
um,

1:19:34.316 --> 1:19:37.052
but it's some big news,

1:19:37.086 --> 1:19:40.623
and we wanted
to tell you now.

1:19:42.524 --> 1:19:44.259
We've been talking about it
for a long time,

1:19:44.293 --> 1:19:48.130
and I've decided,
now that Robin's getting older,

1:19:48.163 --> 1:19:50.966
that I wanna go back to school.

1:19:53.603 --> 1:19:55.237
Okay.

1:19:55.270 --> 1:19:57.272
This past year,
I've been applying to schools

1:19:57.306 --> 1:19:59.208
and I got into a few,

1:19:59.241 --> 1:20:01.410
and I just accepted one.

1:20:04.113 --> 1:20:06.649
Now, the thing is, is...

1:20:06.683 --> 1:20:08.417
it's in Maryland.

1:20:11.153 --> 1:20:14.923
And since it's
a four-year program,

1:20:14.957 --> 1:20:17.059
we're all looking
to move up there.

1:20:19.662 --> 1:20:21.530
What are you talking about?

1:20:24.199 --> 1:20:26.568
We've been batting around
the idea of moving out of here

1:20:26.603 --> 1:20:30.572
for a few years now,

1:20:30.607 --> 1:20:33.710
and I think that this is
the right opportunity.

1:20:33.743 --> 1:20:36.245
What?

1:20:36.278 --> 1:20:37.614
Just to go to school?

1:20:37.647 --> 1:20:39.548
Can't you do that here?

1:20:39.582 --> 1:20:41.618
It's a good school.

1:20:41.651 --> 1:20:43.586
And on top of that,

1:20:43.620 --> 1:20:46.021
we wanna make sure
Robin grows up somewhere

1:20:46.054 --> 1:20:51.193
with more opportunities
than we had.

1:20:51.226 --> 1:20:53.295
We had a great childhood here.

1:20:54.731 --> 1:20:57.734
I just think it's time
for us.

1:20:57.767 --> 1:21:00.202
We've gotten everything we can
outta here.

1:21:30.767 --> 1:21:32.201
Hello?

1:21:32.234 --> 1:21:36.104
Ethan? It's Brody.

1:21:36.138 --> 1:21:37.674
What happened to you?

1:21:37.707 --> 1:21:39.709
They took me in, the cops,

1:21:39.742 --> 1:21:41.443
and they held me overnight.

1:21:41.477 --> 1:21:44.246
I just... I want you to know
that they asked

1:21:44.279 --> 1:21:45.715
a lot of questions,

1:21:45.748 --> 1:21:48.651
but I didn't tell them
anything about, you know,

1:21:48.685 --> 1:21:49.652
what we were doing,

1:21:49.686 --> 1:21:53.322
or anything about you
or the... or the thing.

1:21:53.355 --> 1:21:55.524
Uh, okay, thanks.

1:21:55.557 --> 1:21:57.359
I just...

1:21:57.392 --> 1:21:58.628
you trust me with this,

1:21:58.661 --> 1:22:01.631
and I want you to know
that that means a lot,

1:22:01.664 --> 1:22:04.801
to be a part of it.

1:22:04.834 --> 1:22:06.669
Okay, look, I gotta go.

1:22:06.703 --> 1:22:08.771
I'll call you later.

1:22:08.805 --> 1:22:10.673
Oh yeah, okay.

1:22:10.707 --> 1:22:14.677
Um, I'll, uh,
I'll talk to you soon.

1:25:31.440 --> 1:25:32.474
Hey, this is Shane...

1:25:54.630 --> 1:25:55.998
Hey, this is Shane Daunes.

1:25:56.032 --> 1:25:57.800
I can't get to the phone
right now,

1:25:57.834 --> 1:25:59.802
but if you'll leave
your name and number,

1:25:59.836 --> 1:26:01.938
I'll get back to you
as soon as I can.

1:26:01.971 --> 1:26:02.839
Thanks.

1:26:07.509 --> 1:26:09.544
You know the worst part about
living in that tiny apartment

1:26:09.578 --> 1:26:11.948
after Dad left

1:26:11.981 --> 1:26:18.553
was that our old house was
always just up the road.

1:26:18.588 --> 1:26:21.624
And every time we'd be
driving back from anywhere,

1:26:21.657 --> 1:26:24.994
it felt like
we were going home,

1:26:25.027 --> 1:26:28.030
back to that house,

1:26:28.064 --> 1:26:32.702
and we'd just keep driving.

1:26:32.735 --> 1:26:34.837
And it just sat there
for so long.

1:26:34.871 --> 1:26:37.506
It was empty,

1:26:37.539 --> 1:26:39.407
and we didn't have like
a real reason to not go back,

1:26:39.441 --> 1:26:43.846
we just never did.

1:26:43.880 --> 1:26:46.448
Then...

1:26:46.481 --> 1:26:48.483
after a few years,
those people moved in

1:26:48.517 --> 1:26:51.587
and it felt
a little further away.

1:26:51.621 --> 1:26:57.760
Then they left
and more new people moved in.

1:26:57.794 --> 1:26:59.394
And all this time,

1:26:59.427 --> 1:27:02.497
it's just been
up the road.

1:27:07.937 --> 1:27:10.873
You never left, either!

1:27:10.907 --> 1:27:14.543
You've always been around
and...

1:27:14.576 --> 1:27:19.314
things just never went back
the way they were before, right?

1:27:24.921 --> 1:27:26.421
And I know you stopped
looking up to me,

1:27:26.454 --> 1:27:29.592
at some point.

1:27:29.625 --> 1:27:31.761
But for a long time,
I thought,

1:27:31.794 --> 1:27:35.497
like, eventually,
we're gonna get older

1:27:35.530 --> 1:27:40.402
and things would go back
to how they used to be,

1:27:40.435 --> 1:27:45.440
and we'd be close
like we used to be.

1:27:48.577 --> 1:27:51.479
Then you met Lynn,

1:27:51.513 --> 1:27:58.054
and you pulled
or she pulled you away.

1:27:58.087 --> 1:28:01.924
Then you had Robin.

1:28:01.958 --> 1:28:03.593
I know they didn't
take you away from me,

1:28:03.626 --> 1:28:07.697
but they're just always there.

1:28:14.904 --> 1:28:17.006
And that's keeping things
from getting back

1:28:17.039 --> 1:28:18.808
to the way they were.

1:28:23.779 --> 1:28:25.114
I'm sorry.

1:28:31.153 --> 1:28:33.089
But I can't help
but hate them for that.

1:29:11.694 --> 1:29:12.828
Hello?

1:29:30.713 --> 1:29:31.914
No, I doubt it.

1:29:35.151 --> 1:29:40.923
No, no, I think we'll be here
most of the day.

1:29:40.957 --> 1:29:43.558
Uh, I mean, it'd be
irresponsible to say this...

1:29:54.536 --> 1:29:55.905
Uh, no.

1:29:59.108 --> 1:30:00.508
Hey, Jason, we got
some neighbor kids

1:30:00.542 --> 1:30:02.278
watching from next door.

1:30:02.311 --> 1:30:06.082
You wanna go over there
and see if they saw anything?

1:30:06.115 --> 1:30:07.817
Maybe talk to 'em about it?

1:30:26.102 --> 1:30:27.703
Mr. Daunes, do you remember

1:30:27.737 --> 1:30:30.006
seeing anything suspicious
beforehand,

1:30:30.039 --> 1:30:31.539
anything out of the ordinary?

1:30:31.573 --> 1:30:32.875
I don't know.

1:30:36.212 --> 1:30:39.115
I just went inside
for a minute.

1:30:39.148 --> 1:30:41.717
Sir, has anyone
contacted your wife?

1:30:41.751 --> 1:30:42.585
No.

1:30:42.618 --> 1:30:45.553
I, uh...
she hasn't come home yet.

1:31:24.994 --> 1:31:26.328
Hey, Ethan, it's Lynn.

1:31:26.362 --> 1:31:28.097
Jesus, you're worse
at answering your phone

1:31:28.130 --> 1:31:29.598
than Shane.

1:31:29.632 --> 1:31:31.333
Listen, I don't remember
what time we said

1:31:31.367 --> 1:31:32.768
for tomorrow night,

1:31:32.802 --> 1:31:35.771
but just come around,
like, 6:30.

1:31:35.805 --> 1:31:37.840
Oh, also, Shane wanted me
to tell you,

1:31:37.873 --> 1:31:39.708
a few more people
are coming now.

1:31:39.742 --> 1:31:41.377
I know he said
it'd just be us,

1:31:41.410 --> 1:31:43.312
but a few of his work friends
will be here,

1:31:43.345 --> 1:31:45.114
and my friend Kristen
and her boyfriend.

1:31:45.147 --> 1:31:47.283
- Mom! Look what I made!
- Honey...

1:32:50.112 --> 1:32:53.849
So, what are they telling ya?

1:32:53.883 --> 1:32:55.784
Nothing.

1:32:59.421 --> 1:33:00.789
They found nothing.

1:33:00.823 --> 1:33:04.393
They know nothing, they...

1:33:04.426 --> 1:33:06.128
they aren't telling me
anything, I mean,

1:33:06.162 --> 1:33:08.898
it's almost as if
nothing happened.

1:33:12.868 --> 1:33:16.038
And Lynn left.

1:33:16.071 --> 1:33:18.274
She blames me.

1:33:18.307 --> 1:33:23.379
I was... I was supposed
to be watching her.

1:33:23.412 --> 1:33:26.048
You know, I just...

1:33:32.454 --> 1:33:35.357
I just keep wishing
that I had, you know,

1:33:35.391 --> 1:33:39.929
done something wrong, like,
something to deserve this.

1:33:39.962 --> 1:33:41.430
- Come on, man.
- No, I mean, I know

1:33:41.463 --> 1:33:45.067
it's horrible to say,

1:33:45.100 --> 1:33:48.204
but I wish I had something

1:33:48.237 --> 1:33:52.474
that I could repent for,
just to give it some meaning.

1:33:55.211 --> 1:33:56.478
'Cause I don't know
what to do anymore,

1:33:56.512 --> 1:33:58.180
what am I...

1:34:00.182 --> 1:34:02.351
All right. Look.

1:34:04.787 --> 1:34:06.922
Fuck!

1:34:06.956 --> 1:34:08.857
Obviously,
you didn't hear this from me.

1:34:10.993 --> 1:34:13.395
Brought a guy in
a couple days ago.

1:34:13.429 --> 1:34:14.830
He was parked
on the side of the road

1:34:14.863 --> 1:34:16.832
in the middle of the night.

1:34:16.865 --> 1:34:19.001
He had a couple bags of lye
and a shovel in his trunk.

1:34:19.034 --> 1:34:20.436
Jesus.

1:34:20.469 --> 1:34:22.104
Why didn't you tell us?

1:34:22.137 --> 1:34:24.373
'Cause he was clean.

1:34:24.406 --> 1:34:27.977
He ran,
so we held him overnight.

1:34:28.010 --> 1:34:31.180
We searched his house,
his property,

1:34:31.213 --> 1:34:33.148
but nothing.

1:34:33.182 --> 1:34:36.252
- We had to let him go.
- You let him go?

1:34:36.285 --> 1:34:37.453
When?

1:34:40.823 --> 1:34:41.991
I'm sorry.

1:34:44.594 --> 1:34:45.995
Who is he?

1:34:49.131 --> 1:34:51.033
Who is he, please?

1:34:52.868 --> 1:34:54.303
I don't know.

1:34:54.336 --> 1:34:56.972
Some young guy,
he lives alone.

1:34:57.006 --> 1:34:58.807
Says he's only been in town
a couple months.

1:34:58.841 --> 1:35:00.175
What did I tell you?

1:35:00.209 --> 1:35:02.411
Who'd I say we should be
looking at, man?

1:35:02.444 --> 1:35:04.146
If you guys let him go,

1:35:04.179 --> 1:35:06.148
what makes you think
it's him now?

1:35:06.181 --> 1:35:09.518
We had to let him go.

1:35:09.551 --> 1:35:11.854
I was there when
he came in that night.

1:35:11.887 --> 1:35:14.056
I always thought it was him.

1:35:14.089 --> 1:35:15.291
Circumstances withstanding,

1:35:15.324 --> 1:35:17.393
that guy had something
clearly to hide.

1:35:17.426 --> 1:35:18.927
I can get the truth
out of him.

1:35:18.961 --> 1:35:20.496
Well, hold on, what are
we talking about here?

1:35:20.529 --> 1:35:22.931
We're done talking, okay?

1:35:22.965 --> 1:35:24.601
Give me the address.

1:35:27.102 --> 1:35:29.371
We're gonna get some answers
tonight.

1:35:39.014 --> 1:35:40.516
What are you gonna do?

1:35:44.553 --> 1:35:48.457
I'm gonna make him explain
exactly why he did what he did.

1:35:54.163 --> 1:35:56.065
Then we're gonna do
what's right.

1:36:16.151 --> 1:36:18.954
What you guys
are talking about,

1:36:18.987 --> 1:36:22.625
it's... it's not right.

1:36:24.661 --> 1:36:26.528
You can't convince me

1:36:26.562 --> 1:36:28.197
that he doesn't deserve
everything

1:36:28.230 --> 1:36:30.132
that's gonna happen to him.

1:36:33.469 --> 1:36:35.437
I need you there tonight.

1:36:38.307 --> 1:36:40.409
I need you with me on this.

1:37:06.034 --> 1:37:09.104
Hey, uh...

1:37:09.138 --> 1:37:13.008
I know this is stupid,
but...

1:37:13.041 --> 1:37:14.209
remember when we were kids,

1:37:14.243 --> 1:37:18.414
we used to try to catch
snakes and lizards and

1:37:18.447 --> 1:37:20.583
stuff like that?

1:37:20.617 --> 1:37:24.019
Sometimes, I think about
the time I caught

1:37:24.052 --> 1:37:29.291
this really weird snake thing.

1:37:29.324 --> 1:37:31.960
We tried looking up
what kind it was

1:37:31.994 --> 1:37:36.098
in that snake book
that you used to have,

1:37:36.131 --> 1:37:41.570
and, uh, it turns out it was
an Eastern glass lizard

1:37:41.604 --> 1:37:44.973
or something.

1:37:45.007 --> 1:37:48.477
We didn't know that
at the time,

1:37:48.510 --> 1:37:51.648
so you thought
that you'd found

1:37:51.681 --> 1:37:55.284
this whole new kind of snake.

1:37:57.219 --> 1:38:00.456
What are you saying?

1:38:00.489 --> 1:38:02.324
I just remember you were, like,
really impressed with it,

1:38:02.357 --> 1:38:05.494
like, you thought it was cool.

1:38:22.612 --> 1:38:25.280
I just want you to know
that I had

1:38:25.314 --> 1:38:29.619
the simplest intentions.

1:41:03.606 --> 1:41:05.742
Ethan.

1:41:05.775 --> 1:41:07.610
It's time.

1:41:52.922 --> 1:41:56.893
You know how people always
say they wish

1:41:56.926 --> 1:41:58.828
that they could take
someone's place

1:41:58.861 --> 1:42:00.429
when something bad happens?

1:42:04.299 --> 1:42:07.269
Like, "I wish it was me
instead of them"?

1:42:14.911 --> 1:42:18.014
I guess it's just some way
to show that they care.

1:42:21.483 --> 1:42:27.255
But I actually think it's
a lot worse to be the person

1:42:27.289 --> 1:42:30.927
watching the ones you love
get hurt...

1:42:34.329 --> 1:42:35.732
...wishing it was you.

1:42:45.975 --> 1:42:48.711
Take it or leave it.

1:43:53.441 --> 1:43:55.645
If anyone else was coming,
they'd be here.

1:43:55.678 --> 1:43:57.747
I say it's now or never.

1:44:13.629 --> 1:44:15.430
Shane.

1:44:26.709 --> 1:44:28.911
Can't this all just be over?

1:45:53.863 --> 1:45:55.463
Hey!

1:45:55.497 --> 1:45:57.233
He's asleep.

1:45:57.266 --> 1:45:59.635
I don't think there's
anyone else in the house.

1:46:10.713 --> 1:46:11.881
It's locked.

1:46:13.883 --> 1:46:15.718
We can get it open.

1:46:15.751 --> 1:46:17.853
Maybe there's another door
around back.

1:46:17.887 --> 1:46:20.189
Yeah, I think some of the
windows might be unlocked

1:46:20.222 --> 1:46:22.224
over on the far side
of the house.

1:46:30.266 --> 1:46:35.905
Uh... I...
I think I gotta wait here.

1:49:40.089 --> 1:49:41.223
Ethan?

1:50:12.154 --> 1:50:13.722
Hey! In here.

1:50:19.161 --> 1:50:21.063
Oh, shit. Ethan killed him.

1:50:21.096 --> 1:50:22.998
What happened?

1:50:23.032 --> 1:50:25.501
Ethan! What happened?

1:50:25.534 --> 1:50:27.069
We gotta get him
out of here.

1:50:27.102 --> 1:50:28.404
Here, somebody help me
move him.

1:50:28.437 --> 1:50:30.773
No, no, no!
Don't touch him!

1:50:30.806 --> 1:50:33.175
Everyone just stop!

1:50:50.426 --> 1:50:53.095
Is that the last load?

1:50:53.128 --> 1:50:54.763
Everything I'm taking.

1:52:09.571 --> 1:52:13.375
I'll get the other room
cleaned out tomorrow.

1:52:13.409 --> 1:52:15.044
Okay.

1:53:16.004 --> 1:53:19.942
It seems the madness
may finally be over.

1:53:19.975 --> 1:53:24.313
Local police officer Mark Jones
shot and killed Brody Capra

1:53:24.346 --> 1:53:26.683
in a standoff
at Capra's country home

1:53:26.716 --> 1:53:28.517
last Wednesday night.

1:53:28.550 --> 1:53:31.688
While Capra moved to the area
just two months ago,

1:53:31.721 --> 1:53:33.956
he is now believed
to be responsible

1:53:33.989 --> 1:53:37.259
for the over a dozen
bizarre and violent killings

1:53:37.292 --> 1:53:39.061
in the small town...

1:54:56.338 --> 1:54:58.073
I know they didn't
take you away from me,

1:54:58.106 --> 1:55:01.410
but they're just always there.

1:55:01.443 --> 1:55:03.412
And that's keeping things
from getting back

1:55:03.445 --> 1:55:06.181
to the way they were.

1:55:06.215 --> 1:55:08.718
I'm sorry,

1:55:08.751 --> 1:55:12.087
but I can't help but hate them
for that.

1:55:13.756 --> 1:55:16.525
I know that I shouldn't,

1:55:16.558 --> 1:55:20.329
I know
I shouldn't care so much.

1:55:20.362 --> 1:55:24.500
I should have
something else,

1:55:24.533 --> 1:55:28.403
something more by now...

1:55:28.437 --> 1:55:31.306
but I don't.

1:55:31.340 --> 1:55:34.042
I don't know when it happened,

1:55:34.076 --> 1:55:35.712
but it feels like
everything's changed

1:55:35.745 --> 1:55:37.279
without me,

1:55:37.312 --> 1:55:39.281
everyone's gone.

1:55:40.583 --> 1:55:43.653
You're the only one
I have left,

1:55:43.686 --> 1:55:47.155
and you're not really here
anymore.

1:55:47.189 --> 1:55:50.526
I just want things back
the way they were,

1:55:50.559 --> 1:55:53.596
even just a little bit.

1:55:53.630 --> 1:55:58.166
Man, I think I'd give anything
for that.
