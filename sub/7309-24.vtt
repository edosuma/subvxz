WEBVTT

00:10.499 --> 00:11.903
Welcome home, Director.

00:11.927 --> 00:13.531
How was the Interpol conference?

00:13.555 --> 00:17.028
Fine. Full of Euro cops
trying to hook up with me.

00:17.277 --> 00:18.748
And, no, I didn't.

00:18.772 --> 00:20.174
Oh, I wasn't wondering if...

00:20.198 --> 00:23.333
I would if I were you.
Now, get in, Cynthia.

00:30.062 --> 00:33.412
Is the agency still intact after
a week with Gibbs in charge?

00:33.436 --> 00:35.080
We survived.

00:35.719 --> 00:37.261
Did Gibbs?

00:37.285 --> 00:38.843
Barely.

01:15.139 --> 01:19.066
Cleared customs see ya soo...

02:12.488 --> 02:15.421
- Welcome home, señora.
- Thank you, Noemi.

02:16.061 --> 02:17.448
You hungry, señora?

02:17.472 --> 02:19.311
No, I ate on the plane.

02:19.335 --> 02:21.544
I fix your favorite paella.

02:23.194 --> 02:25.938
- Very well. I'll have a little.
- Okay.

02:33.690 --> 02:36.140
- Will there be anything else, Director?
- No.

02:36.560 --> 02:38.282
Take Cynthia home.

02:38.306 --> 02:41.413
She's going to argue, but it's silly
for her to go back to the office now.

02:41.437 --> 02:43.084
Understood.

02:43.265 --> 02:45.072
What time tomorrow, Director?

02:45.096 --> 02:48.343
05:30, Melvin. I want
to get an early start.

02:48.645 --> 02:49.965
Yes, ma'am.

02:49.989 --> 02:52.901
Noemi, I'll eat in the study.

02:53.002 --> 02:55.211
Si, señora.

03:05.042 --> 03:08.583
My father has been dead since '95.

03:09.255 --> 03:11.187
He stood

03:11.211 --> 03:15.272
where you stand three weeks ago.

03:19.475 --> 03:21.024
Noemi!

03:21.556 --> 03:23.271
Si, señora?

03:23.889 --> 03:25.812
Who's been in my study?

03:26.084 --> 03:27.649
No one, señora.

03:30.552 --> 03:32.331
Obviously someone.

03:34.647 --> 03:36.325
You no do that?

03:38.188 --> 03:39.497
I no do that.

03:40.486 --> 03:42.349
Maybe before you leave?

03:43.761 --> 03:46.615
I've been gone for five days.
Didn't you clean in here?

03:46.639 --> 03:47.826
Si, señora.

03:48.949 --> 03:51.371
I... I no see.

03:51.891 --> 03:53.200
I'm sorry, señora.

03:54.348 --> 03:57.151
It's nothing, Noemi.
Don't worry about it.

04:04.676 --> 04:06.481
Okay, I know this looks a little weird,

04:06.505 --> 04:10.842
but I couldn't get my hands on a
real polygraph machine, so I made one.

04:11.815 --> 04:13.191
Name.

04:14.016 --> 04:15.764
Name! Tell me your name!

04:15.788 --> 04:18.617
Stop acting like a Nazi. Come
over here. Scratch my nose, please.

04:18.641 --> 04:20.548
Right side, right side.

04:20.572 --> 04:22.494
Ow! God, not so hard!

04:22.518 --> 04:25.248
McGee, stop being such a baby. Name.

04:25.936 --> 04:27.960
Timothy McGee... no middle initial.

04:27.984 --> 04:30.109
Have you ever used an alias?

04:30.445 --> 04:32.325
Does a nom de plume count?

04:32.912 --> 04:33.895
It does.

04:33.919 --> 04:35.567
Thom E. Gemcity.

04:35.591 --> 04:36.833
Any other names?

04:37.739 --> 04:38.746
No.

04:39.686 --> 04:41.556
- No?
- No.

04:41.580 --> 04:45.130
Okay, either you or my polygraph is
lying. And since this is a machine and

04:45.154 --> 04:47.025
- it can't lie...
- HAL lied through his chips.

04:47.049 --> 04:49.806
I thought the expression was
"to lie through your teeth."

04:49.830 --> 04:52.764
HAL, the computer.
2001? Sci-fi classic?

04:52.788 --> 04:54.930
How can a six-year-old
movie be a classic?

04:54.954 --> 04:57.236
The film that was made in 1968.

04:57.260 --> 04:59.467
2001: A Space Odyssey
directed by Stanley Kubrick.

04:59.491 --> 05:01.145
How long do you have
to be in this country...

05:01.169 --> 05:03.536
I'm trying to prep McGee
for his polygraph on Monday.

05:03.560 --> 05:05.020
Really?

05:05.271 --> 05:09.277
Well, unless you're a spy, McGeek, the
thought of which is utterly ludicrous.

05:09.301 --> 05:10.556
What's the sweat?

05:10.580 --> 05:12.888
He panics taking tests.

05:13.644 --> 05:14.846
It's not uncommon.

05:14.870 --> 05:17.368
Started in kindergarten.
Couldn't change his answer.

05:17.392 --> 05:20.125
- Hard to erase crayon.
- Tony, it's not funny.

05:20.149 --> 05:24.256
Retaining my Special Agent status is
dependent on passing this polygraph.

05:24.280 --> 05:26.538
Oh, this is definitely a lie.

05:26.562 --> 05:28.799
- What'd you ask him?
- His name.

05:28.823 --> 05:30.302
You lied about your name?

05:30.333 --> 05:31.589
No.

05:31.613 --> 05:33.487
Timothy McGee is my legal name.

05:33.511 --> 05:36.841
Thom E. Gemcity is my pen name.
I don't have any other names.

05:36.865 --> 05:38.419
- Probie.
- Yeah, boss.

05:38.443 --> 05:41.349
And Elf Lord. Two other names.

05:41.373 --> 05:43.597
Why are you torturing McGee?

05:43.621 --> 05:46.498
I am not torturing,
McGee. I am prepping him.

05:46.522 --> 05:48.928
He has his CPS polygraph on Monday.

05:48.952 --> 05:51.158
- Who ordered that?
- Homeland Security.

05:51.182 --> 05:54.917
All NCIS agents must take
it, directors included.

05:54.958 --> 05:56.481
Check your e-mails.

05:59.250 --> 06:00.686
Monday, 09:00.

06:00.710 --> 06:02.706
Tuesday, 13:00.

06:02.730 --> 06:04.380
Boss, what time is your...?

06:12.682 --> 06:15.182
You ever seen the Angel
of Death, Dr. Benoit?

06:15.384 --> 06:18.136
Skeleton, hooded black robe, scythe.

06:19.133 --> 06:20.744
I am not kidding, Doctor.

06:21.792 --> 06:22.769
Carly.

06:22.793 --> 06:26.220
Not a skeleton with a grass-cutter.
That's for kids on Halloween.

06:26.244 --> 06:29.566
Although, if he wanted to he
could appear as a skeleton.

06:30.193 --> 06:31.922
I take it you've seen him?

06:32.308 --> 06:34.624
Once, when my Uncle Luis died.

06:35.564 --> 06:37.176
What did he look like?

06:37.545 --> 06:38.754
Miss Puerto Rico.

06:39.307 --> 06:41.900
What are you talking about?
You can't keep me here.

06:41.924 --> 06:43.870
You want to walk, walk.

06:43.894 --> 06:46.147
I can't with this leg iron on.

06:46.171 --> 06:47.523
I want a cast.

06:47.547 --> 06:49.191
After surgery.

06:49.678 --> 06:51.338
Wait a minute...

06:51.657 --> 06:53.915
Wait a minute, are they...
are they going to knock me out?

06:53.939 --> 06:55.431
Oh, I hope not.

06:56.525 --> 06:57.800
Where's my backpack?

06:59.337 --> 07:02.005
Where's my bag? I want my backpack.

07:05.421 --> 07:07.750
Sorry to stick you
with this one, Doctor.

07:07.774 --> 07:09.077
No problem, Annie.

07:09.101 --> 07:12.445
Dr. Jessup wants him in monkey
bars till he can operate.

07:17.235 --> 07:19.847
Three MGs of Versed, two
of morphine, 15 minutes ago.

07:19.871 --> 07:21.813
And he's still amped up?

07:21.951 --> 07:24.628
I think the boy had more
on board than ER put in him.

07:24.652 --> 07:26.839
Patti said he wouldn't
let them take blood.

07:26.863 --> 07:29.456
And it was a fight just
to get the leg X-rayed.

07:29.480 --> 07:31.513
Hey, where's my phone?!
Someone stole my phone!

07:31.537 --> 07:32.856
You didn't come in with one, Devon.

07:32.880 --> 07:34.895
No, I had a cell phone!
I was texting on it when...

07:34.919 --> 07:37.798
When you stepped in
front of a cab at Dulles.

07:38.397 --> 07:41.334
I'm Dr. Benoit, Devon. Give me a minute.

07:50.778 --> 07:53.114
You're hypertensive and tachycardiac.

07:53.404 --> 07:54.696
What's that?

07:55.435 --> 07:56.610
Not good.

07:58.401 --> 08:01.108
Have you taken any drugs
we don't know about?

08:02.089 --> 08:03.736
We're not the police, Devon.

08:05.028 --> 08:07.286
Our only concern is your well-being.

08:07.310 --> 08:11.119
I want... I want to call my sister.

08:13.031 --> 08:14.966
There's a phone in your room.

08:18.655 --> 08:20.184
What do you think, Doctor?

08:20.903 --> 08:23.367
Keep your eye out for Miss Puerto Rico.

08:46.823 --> 08:48.350
Visiting your ex-wife?

08:48.736 --> 08:50.012
Waiting for you.

08:50.330 --> 08:51.824
How'd you know I'd be here?

08:51.922 --> 08:53.896
Friday night. Old weekend.

08:53.920 --> 08:55.657
Hold on, Emily.

08:56.571 --> 08:57.924
Hi, Daddy!

08:57.948 --> 09:00.116
Hey, Em. Be there in a minute.

09:03.815 --> 09:06.544
Diane look that pissed
at you after the divorce?

09:07.037 --> 09:08.681
She's looking at me, Tobias.

09:10.346 --> 09:12.287
Ever think of picking up a phone?

09:12.721 --> 09:14.010
Hard lines are tapped.

09:14.034 --> 09:16.198
Cell calls snatched
right out of the air.

09:16.222 --> 09:18.781
Turning into a conspiracy
nut, Jethro. What's next?

09:18.805 --> 09:20.292
Alien abductions?

09:20.316 --> 09:21.835
Only if you don't answer my question.

09:21.859 --> 09:23.781
- Why the polygraphs?
- No.

09:25.329 --> 09:27.658
- Do you still dream about O.J.- ing Diane?
- Nah,

09:28.431 --> 09:30.697
Emily kind of likes her. You?

09:31.283 --> 09:33.958
Only when I think about my
grandfather's railroad watch.

09:33.982 --> 09:35.778
Beautiful chimes.

09:36.029 --> 09:37.657
FBI being polygraphed?

09:37.798 --> 09:40.107
No. And before you run
through the alphabet soup.

09:40.131 --> 09:42.760
This net is being cast
strictly over NCIS.

09:42.784 --> 09:44.431
Who's doing the fishing?

09:44.455 --> 09:48.717
Obviously, someone who thinks
there's a security risk at NCIS.

09:49.019 --> 09:50.275
CIA.

09:51.198 --> 09:52.910
Who are they after, Tobias?

09:55.720 --> 09:56.777
Your boss.

10:27.242 --> 10:28.242
Señor Gibbs.

10:29.160 --> 10:30.234
Director home?

10:30.604 --> 10:31.677
I'm in here.

10:37.054 --> 10:41.528
In polite society, one
usually calls before a visit.

10:41.683 --> 10:42.667
Bourbon?

10:42.691 --> 10:45.140
I kicked in too many
doors to be polite. Yeah.

10:46.114 --> 10:49.504
I appreciate the restraint
you showed by using the bell.

10:50.797 --> 10:54.102
I've been rather fond of
that door since I was a child.

10:54.619 --> 10:57.677
You could have waited to
report till Monday, Jethro.

10:59.046 --> 11:00.509
That's not why I'm here.

11:00.533 --> 11:02.521
You lost your protection
detail in Paris.

11:02.545 --> 11:05.186
You went missing for 21
hours. Where were you?

11:06.555 --> 11:08.408
You sound like a jealous husband.

11:08.432 --> 11:09.689
How would you know?

11:10.814 --> 11:12.240
Do you want this or not?

11:16.889 --> 11:19.213
Don't... touch that!

11:19.834 --> 11:20.908
It's Scotch.

11:21.932 --> 11:23.043
You drink bourbon.

11:24.246 --> 11:25.246
So you.

11:27.369 --> 11:31.418
I had another visitor
before you arrived...

11:32.341 --> 11:34.003
unannounced.

11:34.272 --> 11:35.984
Did he duck out the back?

11:38.246 --> 11:40.733
Now you do sound like a jealous husband.

11:42.181 --> 11:44.256
You go off grid for 21 hours...

11:45.179 --> 11:48.251
and we're being polygraphed
for a security breach.

11:49.246 --> 11:51.951
Drink your bourbon and
say good night, Gracie.

11:53.342 --> 11:55.786
What were you doing for 21 hours, Jenny?

11:56.184 --> 11:57.976
What we used to do.

11:58.445 --> 12:00.040
Ever so well.

12:02.124 --> 12:05.296
When you're lying,
your right eye twitches.

12:06.811 --> 12:08.199
It always has.

12:14.388 --> 12:16.160
You know, constitutionally,

12:16.184 --> 12:18.372
you can refuse to take a polygraph.

12:18.396 --> 12:20.118
I'd have to turn in my badge.

12:20.142 --> 12:22.530
True, but you don't
have to take the test.

12:22.561 --> 12:24.225
Hey, I have an idea.

12:24.249 --> 12:28.018
Why don't we get Ducky to tell
the examiners that Tim is just way

12:28.042 --> 12:29.690
too stressed out to take the test?

12:29.714 --> 12:32.291
Ducky's a medical examiner,
he's not a psychiatrist.

12:32.315 --> 12:35.585
- But he does psychological profiles.
- Of serial killers.

12:35.770 --> 12:39.476
That's good I'll go from Federal
Agent to serial killer in one day.

12:39.500 --> 12:40.942
It was just a thought.

12:42.620 --> 12:43.895
Here you go.

12:44.416 --> 12:46.407
Thanks. Great bartender.

12:46.431 --> 12:48.932
- You can beat a polygraph.
- No, you can't.

12:48.956 --> 12:51.290
I've done it, Abby. It's
part of Mossad training.

12:51.314 --> 12:53.445
- All you have to do...
- Oh, hello!

12:53.469 --> 12:55.975
- If it's unethical, I can't hear it!
- Well, don't listen.

12:56.109 --> 12:57.229
Fine.

12:57.834 --> 12:58.818
Go ahead...

12:58.842 --> 13:00.597
May we join you?

13:00.621 --> 13:03.111
- Hey, Ducky, here take my chair.
- No, no, no, no, Timothy.

13:03.135 --> 13:04.862
At a bar, I prefer to stand.

13:04.886 --> 13:05.886
Me, too.

13:06.043 --> 13:09.243
Macallan neat. Mineral
water on the side. No ice.

13:09.629 --> 13:12.549
I'll take a, uh, chocolate martini.

13:13.082 --> 13:14.267
Just kidding.

13:14.291 --> 13:16.365
Uh, make that a Green Fairy Mojito.

13:16.389 --> 13:17.366
You got it.

13:17.390 --> 13:21.473
Why is everybody so dour?
It's TGIF and the happy hour!

13:21.497 --> 13:24.972
Homeland Security's ordering
us to take a polygraph.

13:24.996 --> 13:27.497
That's rather odd. But
there's nothing to worry about.

13:27.967 --> 13:30.568
Unless... you're a spy.

13:31.223 --> 13:32.971
Why are you looking at me?!

13:32.995 --> 13:36.278
I'm trying to lighten the
atmosphere with a little humor.

13:36.302 --> 13:38.661
I don't think they expect
you to be funny, Doctor.

13:39.182 --> 13:41.717
- That didn't come out right.
- No, I should say not.

13:41.741 --> 13:44.306
I mean I don't think they
expect a Scotsman to be funny.

13:44.330 --> 13:46.408
Stop digging, Jimmy.

13:46.432 --> 13:47.756
You've almost reached China.

13:47.780 --> 13:50.173
Yeah, a round for my friends on me.

13:50.197 --> 13:53.154
Dispelling two misconceptions
about Scotsmen in one night.

13:53.178 --> 13:54.968
Does anyone know where
the rest rooms are?

13:54.992 --> 13:56.068
- I do!
- Okay.

13:56.092 --> 13:59.132
One moment! First... a toast!

13:59.156 --> 14:00.767
- Please, God, make it quick.
- Amen.

14:00.791 --> 14:03.785
May the best you've ever seen
be the worst you'll ever see.

14:03.809 --> 14:07.470
May a mouse never leave your
girnal with a teardrop in his eye.

14:07.494 --> 14:10.939
May you stay hale and hearty
until you're old enough to die.

14:10.963 --> 14:13.826
May you always be as happy
as we wish you all to be.

14:13.850 --> 14:15.352
Guys, I'm sorry I gotta go.

14:15.376 --> 14:16.397
Uh, me, too.

14:17.907 --> 14:19.695
- Great toast, Ducky.
- Uh... thank you.

14:19.719 --> 14:20.854
Terrific.

14:20.878 --> 14:22.237
Really good, Doctor.

14:23.544 --> 14:27.615
May a mouse never leave your
girdle with a teardrop in his eye.

14:27.639 --> 14:30.776
Not girdle, girnal. It's an oat bin.

14:30.800 --> 14:33.957
If it was empty, a mouse would cry.

14:34.935 --> 14:37.549
To dry-eyed mice.

14:38.184 --> 14:39.320
Yeah, yeah.

14:42.257 --> 14:43.700
Stupid bastard.

14:44.373 --> 14:47.137
I don't think that Dee
meant to get hit by a...

14:57.497 --> 14:59.104
Why didn't you push it?

14:59.910 --> 15:01.555
It was lit.

15:02.873 --> 15:04.417
I'd have pushed it anyway.

15:05.184 --> 15:06.398
And why is that?

15:06.626 --> 15:07.908
To watch it light up.

15:18.814 --> 15:21.806
Why don't you get her
some help? ER's on one.

15:24.565 --> 15:25.791
You talking to me?

15:27.499 --> 15:29.892
Yeah, I'm talking to you, Bobby.

15:31.186 --> 15:33.423
- His name is Nick.
- Shut up, Bernie.

15:33.826 --> 15:36.113
But he thinks that your name is Bobby.

15:36.595 --> 15:38.600
- Don't you?
- No.

15:38.953 --> 15:42.717
He thinks his name is Bobby. Don't you?

15:44.104 --> 15:46.934
You don't think your name
is Bobby, do you, Nick?

15:46.958 --> 15:49.172
Shut up. Can't you see he's a cop?

15:49.642 --> 15:52.809
Hey, ER said Devon Watson was up here.

15:52.833 --> 15:54.854
He called his sister to pick him up.

15:54.878 --> 15:56.558
I'm his sister.

15:57.565 --> 15:59.304
He hasn't gone into surgery.

15:59.328 --> 16:02.331
Surgery? For a broken leg?

16:02.753 --> 16:04.846
It's a severe compound fracture.

16:04.870 --> 16:06.347
Put a splint on it.

16:08.189 --> 16:09.605
Is there a problem here, Carly?

16:09.629 --> 16:12.319
I don't know. Do we have a problem?

16:14.283 --> 16:15.466
No problem.

16:15.835 --> 16:18.479
My girl's worried about
her brother, that's all.

16:18.503 --> 16:19.649
Wants to see him.

16:20.186 --> 16:21.613
Yeah, can I see Dee?

16:21.941 --> 16:23.644
That's up to Dr. Benoit.

16:24.227 --> 16:26.355
- I need this stat.
- Sure.

16:28.131 --> 16:30.555
This is Mr. Watson's sister, Dr. Benoit.

16:30.890 --> 16:34.414
Bernadette. But
everybody calls me Bernie.

16:36.192 --> 16:37.465
And you are?

16:37.489 --> 16:38.503
A friend.

16:39.191 --> 16:40.191
Have a name...

16:40.913 --> 16:42.068
friend?

16:42.830 --> 16:43.943
Nick.

16:44.358 --> 16:46.090
He thinks his name is Bobby.

16:49.895 --> 16:52.368
Room 331. Ten minutes.

16:52.502 --> 16:54.190
I wanted to be a doctor.

16:54.214 --> 16:55.299
Um, but my dad...

16:55.323 --> 16:57.799
She doesn't want to hear about
your life history, Bernie.

16:59.833 --> 17:02.045
- I told you to keep your trap shut.
- Sorry.

17:02.069 --> 17:05.180
I didn't think doctors
cleaned out urinals.

17:05.204 --> 17:07.017
We draw the line at bedpans.

17:07.671 --> 17:10.050
Want to take a 15 minute break with me?

17:10.768 --> 17:12.546
We'll be in the cafeteria, Carly.

17:12.569 --> 17:13.732
Okay, Doctor.

17:13.756 --> 17:16.457
And clock that ten minutes.

17:23.834 --> 17:26.334
What's with you calling
that loser Bobby?

17:26.358 --> 17:28.670
Well, he was doing
DeNiro in the elevator.

17:28.694 --> 17:30.888
You know, like, you talkin' to me?

17:30.912 --> 17:32.314
You talkin' to me?!

17:32.338 --> 17:33.599
So I called him Bobby.

17:33.623 --> 17:36.112
Sometimes you are so juvenile.

17:36.136 --> 17:38.227
Yes, but it makes me loveable.

17:39.401 --> 17:41.385
You don't look so good, Dee.

17:41.409 --> 17:44.295
I don't feel so good, Bernie.

17:44.319 --> 17:46.582
- Does it hurt?
- Shut up, Bernie.

17:47.385 --> 17:48.859
You got to get out of here.

17:48.883 --> 17:50.520
Man, they won't let me out.

17:50.544 --> 17:53.191
They can't keep you. All you
got to do is sign a release.

17:53.215 --> 17:55.237
What... what about my leg?

17:55.261 --> 17:56.570
We'll fix it later.

17:57.448 --> 17:58.622
I can't walk.

17:58.646 --> 18:02.790
That's why they make the chairs with
those, you know, things that go round.

18:02.814 --> 18:04.273
Oh, wheelchairs!

18:04.525 --> 18:06.490
I'm really scared, man.

18:07.160 --> 18:09.107
I'm feeling really cold, Nick.

18:10.858 --> 18:12.238
I think I might be leaking.

18:12.262 --> 18:14.484
Be cool, Dee, be cool.
You're not leaking.

18:14.508 --> 18:16.049
Don't let me die here, man.

18:16.073 --> 18:17.896
You're not going to die, honey.

18:18.049 --> 18:19.469
I got to tell somebody.
I've got to tell somebody.

18:19.493 --> 18:21.611
No, no... You're not going
to tell anybody nothing!

18:21.635 --> 18:24.801
Stop! Stop it, Nick! You're killing him!

18:24.825 --> 18:26.267
Shut up.

18:29.881 --> 18:31.811
I hope this stops by morning.

18:32.063 --> 18:34.302
I want you to see the house in sunshine.

18:35.511 --> 18:36.634
It leaks.

18:36.658 --> 18:38.403
No, it doesn't leak.

18:38.638 --> 18:40.047
It has bats.

18:40.182 --> 18:43.346
Bats don't come out in the sunshine.
I hate bats... ever since I saw Dracula.

18:43.370 --> 18:45.483
You're chickening out on me, aren't you?

18:46.543 --> 18:47.885
After you promised?

18:49.748 --> 18:51.275
Did I say Scout's honor?

18:52.585 --> 18:54.860
Wow, you drive a hard bargain. Okay.

18:56.001 --> 18:58.294
Yes, I want to see the house.

18:58.318 --> 19:01.687
Just as long as seeing doesn't
necessarily mean buying.

19:02.092 --> 19:03.921
No, of course it doesn't.

19:04.935 --> 19:08.829
I just want you to give it
some serious consideration.

19:10.321 --> 19:13.436
You can count on that.
Especially after last night.

19:13.460 --> 19:15.701
I think that, uh, you deserve...

19:15.725 --> 19:18.164
I'm sorry, that was
you last night, right?

19:18.188 --> 19:20.630
With the mask and the strange headgear?

19:23.433 --> 19:24.557
Code blue.

19:25.777 --> 19:27.086
Code blue.

19:30.308 --> 19:32.929
Hang in there, Devon. You're
going to be okay. Got the pulse ox.

19:32.953 --> 19:36.930
- What do we have?
- Blood pressure 80/40. Heart 150.

19:36.954 --> 19:38.825
- Don't need that drug panel now.
- Where's the crash cart?

19:38.849 --> 19:41.178
- Coming in.
- Carly and I have him.

19:41.202 --> 19:43.491
Annie, two milligram Naloxone I.V. push.

19:43.515 --> 19:45.561
Got it. Two milligrams I.V. push.

19:45.585 --> 19:47.112
Lungs are clear.

19:47.665 --> 19:49.992
Pupils are pinpoint and un-reactive.

19:50.016 --> 19:53.120
B.P. 75/35, Heart rate 160.

19:53.144 --> 19:54.646
EKG leads.

19:56.274 --> 19:58.214
Okay, lift him on three.

19:58.238 --> 20:01.149
B.P. 65/35. Heart rate's 175.

20:04.892 --> 20:08.155
EKG leads in place. He's in V-tach.

20:08.179 --> 20:09.783
How'd he go sour so fast?

20:09.807 --> 20:12.528
He flew in from Caracas three hours ago.

20:12.552 --> 20:14.917
He's probably body-packing
heroin. The bags must have burst.

20:14.941 --> 20:16.709
We've got V-fib. He's
stopped breathing.

20:16.733 --> 20:17.917
Damn.

20:17.941 --> 20:20.113
Start bagging him. Charge to 360.

20:20.137 --> 20:22.335
Still in V-fib. Should
I give him an amp of epi?

20:22.359 --> 20:24.237
Not till we shock him.

20:27.532 --> 20:30.989
Still in V-fib. No pressure, no pulse.

20:56.310 --> 20:58.802
I'm sorry, Ms. Watson.

20:59.180 --> 21:01.335
- Me, too.
- Where's he taking him?

21:02.383 --> 21:03.567
Hospital morgue.

21:05.072 --> 21:06.311
We pick him up there?

21:06.335 --> 21:08.390
No, you do not pick him up there.

21:11.386 --> 21:12.662
Sign it, Bernie.

21:15.820 --> 21:17.286
How's Carly?

21:17.310 --> 21:20.297
Not bad considering she
saw the Angel of Death.

21:21.237 --> 21:23.027
What did this one look like?

21:23.051 --> 21:24.527
Shirley Temple.

21:25.584 --> 21:27.720
I don't like losing patients.

21:28.127 --> 21:30.926
If your brother had told us
he was body-packing drugs,

21:30.950 --> 21:32.641
we might have saved him.

21:34.951 --> 21:36.245
Or if you had told us.

21:38.132 --> 21:40.558
I don't know what's in Dee's gut, Doc.

21:42.999 --> 21:44.661
And neither do you.

21:44.980 --> 21:46.360
Now...

21:46.384 --> 21:48.180
where do we pick up his body?

21:50.462 --> 21:53.860
City morgue after he's been autopsied.

21:54.246 --> 21:55.992
We don't need an autopsy.

21:56.814 --> 21:57.886
I do.

22:02.263 --> 22:04.113
Come on, we got to get out of here.

22:07.764 --> 22:09.165
Suck it up, Bernie!

22:09.451 --> 22:11.176
You got to get me somethin', Nick.

22:11.200 --> 22:12.941
I'm gettin' too shaky to walk.

22:12.965 --> 22:15.436
Pharmacy downstairs. I'll
get cough syrup with codeine.

22:15.460 --> 22:17.240
That ain't gonna help much.

22:17.264 --> 22:18.877
Never pimp a junkie.

22:18.901 --> 22:21.974
- I ain't a junkie!
- Then walk out of here!

22:29.131 --> 22:32.162
He knew Devon was
body-packing and said nothing.

22:32.186 --> 22:34.233
Well, he didn't want
to lose his shipment.

22:35.122 --> 22:36.845
That makes him an accessory.

22:36.869 --> 22:39.235
Yeah? How could you prove that, Jeanne?

22:39.259 --> 22:41.432
I don't know, but I can't
just let him walk out of here.

22:41.456 --> 22:44.321
Dr. Benoit, you don't
want to get involved.

22:44.345 --> 22:46.741
I am involved, Annie. That
boy didn't have to die.

22:46.765 --> 22:49.020
No, but that is not your fault.

22:49.044 --> 22:51.887
Jeanne, the coroner's
going to do an autopsy.

22:51.911 --> 22:54.891
He's going to find the
drugs, notify narcotics.

22:54.915 --> 22:56.703
What more can you do than that?

22:59.617 --> 23:00.691
I don't know.

23:05.475 --> 23:06.952
I feel so damn helpless!

23:09.403 --> 23:12.244
They're all like that the first
year. At least the good ones.

23:12.268 --> 23:14.620
It takes a little while to get calluses.

23:15.080 --> 23:17.368
I don't know if Jeanne ever will, Annie.

23:19.621 --> 23:20.847
Love.

23:26.167 --> 23:28.819
- You pushed the wrong button!
- Sorry.

23:33.122 --> 23:35.002
What are you doing down here?

23:35.891 --> 23:37.234
Pushed the wrong button.

23:40.158 --> 23:42.323
- Morgue down here?
- Why?

23:43.583 --> 23:46.227
Bernie might want to take
a last look at her brother.

23:46.251 --> 23:48.231
Morgue's closed.

23:49.271 --> 23:51.524
There's no one down here, anyway.

23:52.043 --> 23:53.503
Her brother's here.

23:54.678 --> 23:56.358
I don't think that's funny.

24:04.987 --> 24:06.355
Hey, boss, what's up?

24:06.379 --> 24:08.224
There's a letter on your desk.

24:08.461 --> 24:09.636
Sign it.

24:17.773 --> 24:20.088
- What is it?
- Just sign it, Tim.

24:24.899 --> 24:27.181
It's a get out of jail free card.

24:38.347 --> 24:40.372
Boss, why would I need such a card?

24:40.396 --> 24:44.056
Because you're going
to hack into the CIA.

24:49.781 --> 24:52.563
Wake up! Wake up! Wake up! Wake up!

24:54.056 --> 24:57.561
Okay, I know you guys have
been working really hard lately,

24:57.585 --> 25:00.310
and I promised that you
could have the weekend off,

25:00.334 --> 25:02.631
but this sounds like an emergency,

25:02.655 --> 25:06.128
so I need everybody to get
those electrons flowing!

25:06.581 --> 25:09.434
If anybody is not up to
it, I need to know now,

25:10.357 --> 25:12.254
not when the Director arrives.

25:13.009 --> 25:14.167
Something's wrong.

25:31.261 --> 25:32.302
Ready.

25:34.987 --> 25:37.912
Thanks for coming in on
such short notice, Abby.

25:38.267 --> 25:41.868
Neither rain, nor snow,
nor sleet, nor hail

25:41.892 --> 25:44.790
will keep this scientist
from her appointed rounds.

25:44.814 --> 25:45.814
Nice.

25:45.838 --> 25:48.779
You've adopted what the
post office has forgotten.

25:49.329 --> 25:51.418
Did you climb the Eiffel Tower?

25:51.972 --> 25:53.096
No.

25:53.482 --> 25:54.655
No?

25:54.679 --> 25:58.215
How can you be in Paris and
not climb the Eiffel Tower?!

26:01.967 --> 26:04.912
I want to know whose
fingerprints are on these.

26:05.482 --> 26:07.649
Chain of evidence is not important.

26:09.326 --> 26:11.172
I'll be in my office.

26:20.823 --> 26:22.192
Boss, you were right.

26:22.216 --> 26:25.508
The order to polygraph came
from Homeland Security's.

26:25.532 --> 26:28.410
Assistant Director for
Infrastructure Protection.

26:28.790 --> 26:30.193
But it didn't originate from there.

26:30.217 --> 26:34.446
I traced into his IMAP account using
an encryption algorithm developed...

26:34.671 --> 26:36.639
You're not really interested
in how I did this, are you?

26:36.663 --> 26:38.089
Nope, I'm not.

26:38.458 --> 26:42.916
Okay, well, the order went from Homeland
Security to China, then Kurdistan.

26:42.940 --> 26:45.817
It went through a secondary server
in India to the island of Cypress.

26:45.841 --> 26:47.961
Then through Puerto Rico.

26:48.313 --> 26:51.345
Where it followed a bank
line back to D.C. and...

26:51.369 --> 26:52.419
CIA.

26:52.443 --> 26:54.757
Specifically, their
National Clandestine Service.

26:54.781 --> 26:58.000
It went in and out of a maze of
incoming and outgoing Black Op chatter.

26:58.024 --> 27:00.322
All encrypted. That's where I lost it.

27:01.846 --> 27:03.260
But I found it again.

27:03.718 --> 27:05.532
It's part of a Black Op.

27:05.556 --> 27:07.027
It's code-named Lodestone.

27:07.051 --> 27:11.750
Running out of the CIA section for
Weapons Control and Arms Proliferation.

27:12.287 --> 27:14.251
The Frog.

27:29.121 --> 27:31.665
Who do I have to thank for this?

27:32.041 --> 27:34.811
A former FBI agent.

27:35.314 --> 27:37.408
You're very resourceful, Kort.

27:37.643 --> 27:38.767
I try.

27:39.053 --> 27:41.202
So you've recorded their conversations?

27:41.402 --> 27:42.384
No.

27:42.408 --> 27:43.638
No? Why?

27:44.142 --> 27:47.062
You didn't want to
intrude on their privacy?

27:48.182 --> 27:50.465
I didn't think it was necessary.

27:50.851 --> 27:52.277
No? Why was that?

27:53.133 --> 27:55.718
I only needed photos for leverage.

27:56.909 --> 27:59.273
- This DiNozzo is married?
- No.

27:59.845 --> 28:02.256
Then how did you
intend to gain leverage?

28:06.572 --> 28:08.435
You intend to harm her?

28:09.257 --> 28:10.399
Only threaten.

28:14.809 --> 28:16.017
He loves her?

28:16.823 --> 28:17.897
DiNozzo...

28:18.599 --> 28:19.760
he's a player.

28:20.847 --> 28:23.258
Never with a skirt
more than a few weeks.

28:24.517 --> 28:25.994
That's too bad.

28:26.536 --> 28:29.066
A man in love could be persuaded...

28:30.623 --> 28:32.268
to do almost anything.

28:32.637 --> 28:34.265
DiNozzo's a white hat.

28:34.651 --> 28:36.766
He won't want to see her harmed.

28:37.851 --> 28:39.820
Have you not noticed, Kort?

28:43.549 --> 28:45.328
I like white hats.

28:48.786 --> 28:50.978
Shirley Temple looked
through the door...

28:51.002 --> 28:53.756
Shirley Temple? I didn't
say Shirley Temple.

28:54.412 --> 28:55.636
Who is Shirley Temple?

28:56.223 --> 28:58.835
A child star from the 1930s
with curly blonde hair.

28:58.859 --> 28:59.926
Well, you saw him.

28:59.950 --> 29:02.461
If you say he looked like Shirley
Temple, he looked like Shirley Temple.

29:02.485 --> 29:04.193
I didn't see him, Carly.

29:04.217 --> 29:06.929
The Angel was standing right behind you.

29:06.953 --> 29:08.436
Your Angel of Death...

29:08.460 --> 29:11.327
wandered away from her mother in ICU.

29:11.351 --> 29:14.130
They flew in from Paris to see
their grandfather who stroked.

29:14.154 --> 29:16.520
Security's been searching
the hospital for an hour.

29:17.535 --> 29:21.211
If you see the Angel of Death
again, her name is Sarah.

29:21.295 --> 29:23.409
It's just a lost little girl, Carly.

29:24.630 --> 29:25.956
If you say so, Doctor.

29:28.289 --> 29:30.391
All right, well, I will
see you in the morning.

29:30.415 --> 29:33.172
- I gotta go.
- I'll be out at 7:00.

29:34.095 --> 29:36.596
And if you see a hooded skeleton, duck.

29:37.934 --> 29:38.992
Dr. Benoit.

29:39.432 --> 29:42.241
That addict and her pimp were down in
the basement asking about the morgue.

29:42.265 --> 29:43.390
You didn't let them stay there?

29:43.414 --> 29:45.669
Of course not. I made them return
with me to the ground floor.

29:45.693 --> 29:46.878
They leave the hospital?

29:46.902 --> 29:48.070
They went into the pharmacy.

29:48.094 --> 29:49.527
I had to return the gurney to the ER,

29:49.551 --> 29:51.829
but I got a feeling
they're going to try again.

29:51.853 --> 29:52.935
Thanks, Bill.

29:52.959 --> 29:56.435
Annie, call Security. Ask
them to meet me in the morgue.

29:58.740 --> 30:00.317
Miss me already?

30:02.616 --> 30:05.204
Our grieving couple
may be in the morgue.

30:07.469 --> 30:08.795
Damn.

30:09.170 --> 30:10.581
They never make it easy.

30:21.358 --> 30:22.902
He's not in the cabinet, Bernie.

30:23.372 --> 30:26.286
I drank the cough syrup
and it ain't doing nothing.

30:26.310 --> 30:27.863
No drugs in a morgue, dummy.

30:27.887 --> 30:30.317
You want a fix... find your brother.

30:36.649 --> 30:37.858
Nick.

30:44.000 --> 30:45.235
Hi ya, Dee.

30:50.521 --> 30:51.856
Hey!

30:53.296 --> 30:54.296
Jeanne.

31:07.359 --> 31:08.707
He's still warm.

31:12.315 --> 31:15.509
That's 'cause he hasn't had
time to cool. Have you, Dee?

31:17.557 --> 31:18.950
Jeanne, slow down.

31:20.655 --> 31:21.908
Is it...?

31:21.932 --> 31:23.743
Jeanne, hey.

31:24.014 --> 31:26.595
You trying to get yourself killed?
He's at least got a knife in there.

31:26.619 --> 31:28.944
I will not let him butcher
her brother in front of her.

31:28.968 --> 31:30.037
Keep your voice down.

31:30.061 --> 31:32.333
Those drugs are in
25 feet of intestines.

31:32.859 --> 31:34.301
He doesn't know where to cut.

31:34.325 --> 31:36.398
He'll make a gory mess she'll
never get out of her head.

31:36.422 --> 31:37.982
Get behind me.

31:38.268 --> 31:40.936
- Why?
- Because I tell you to.

31:47.481 --> 31:50.250
Haven't got a weapon on
you by any chance, have you?

32:04.523 --> 32:06.537
I have a funny feeling, Doctor.

32:06.994 --> 32:08.656
It's the tequila, my dear.

32:08.680 --> 32:12.091
You've had three shooters just
in the time I've been here.

32:12.256 --> 32:15.831
Straight to voice mail. Just
like always when he's with her.

32:16.649 --> 32:18.747
- Tony?
- What?

32:20.431 --> 32:21.408
Nothing.

32:21.432 --> 32:22.596
Oh, no, no, no.

32:22.620 --> 32:24.705
That look was definitely something.

32:24.729 --> 32:27.031
Well, why do you monitor Tony?

32:27.055 --> 32:28.595
I don't monitor Tony.

32:28.619 --> 32:32.081
Oh, yes, you do, my dear,
like a mother with her toddler.

32:33.018 --> 32:35.183
That's a good description.

32:35.555 --> 32:38.809
Or a woman with a wayward lover.

32:39.246 --> 32:40.342
Ducky...

32:40.845 --> 32:43.363
do not profile me... I'm not a killer.

32:43.833 --> 32:48.369
Correction... I have killed
before, but never feloniously.

32:48.688 --> 32:50.584
Ziva, it's Friday night.

32:52.546 --> 32:56.158
Tony is with his girlfriend
and you are worried about him.

32:58.057 --> 32:59.595
What does that tell you?

33:00.058 --> 33:01.374
He is my partner.

33:01.809 --> 33:03.985
And my partner said he would be here.

33:04.147 --> 33:05.356
And...

33:08.590 --> 33:10.000
and I have this...

33:11.107 --> 33:12.769
not so good feeling.

33:22.373 --> 33:23.644
I didn't find nothing.

33:23.668 --> 33:26.620
The way you're shaking,
you couldn't find a shotgun.

33:26.804 --> 33:28.499
Let's see...

33:39.592 --> 33:41.623
You called Security, Doc?

33:43.200 --> 33:45.298
Of course you did. Call 'em off.

33:46.632 --> 33:48.489
I said call 'em off.

33:48.513 --> 33:51.689
You haven't done anything
that can't be forgotten.

33:52.812 --> 33:55.485
- Do what he says, Jeanne.
- Why?

33:56.072 --> 33:58.842
They can leave now, and we'll
forget this ever happened.

33:59.748 --> 34:01.379
Would you do that?

34:02.538 --> 34:03.746
Yes.

34:06.213 --> 34:07.489
Tony...

34:11.763 --> 34:13.274
Will you forget now?

34:16.001 --> 34:17.536
That's what I thought.

34:18.091 --> 34:20.239
Call off Security.

34:32.819 --> 34:34.297
Put it on the speaker.

34:37.993 --> 34:39.504
Security. Jackson.

34:40.056 --> 34:42.181
This is Dr. Benoit in the morgue.

34:42.206 --> 34:44.540
Oh, sorry, Doctor. I'll
have a man there in a minute.

34:44.563 --> 34:46.672
We're just stretched thin
looking for that little girl.

34:46.696 --> 34:48.375
You can recall him.

34:48.592 --> 34:49.879
It was a false alarm.

34:49.902 --> 34:53.081
Okay. Can I have your
hospital I.D. number please?

34:54.940 --> 34:56.179
766.

34:57.321 --> 34:59.234
Thank you, Dr. Benoit.

35:02.317 --> 35:04.034
Is a little girl lost?

35:05.317 --> 35:06.996
More than one.

35:09.413 --> 35:11.058
Surgery first, Doc.

35:12.216 --> 35:13.239
No.

35:13.625 --> 35:14.727
No?

35:14.751 --> 35:16.344
I help him first.

35:18.552 --> 35:20.274
You're a slow learner, Doc.

35:20.298 --> 35:22.463
I called off Security.

35:23.134 --> 35:25.258
I help him, then...

35:25.282 --> 35:27.044
I help you.

35:27.632 --> 35:31.894
If that's not good enough, shoot me.

35:34.008 --> 35:35.804
Don't hurt her, Nick.

35:44.201 --> 35:46.450
Tony? Tony?

35:46.601 --> 35:47.809
Can you sit up?

35:48.212 --> 35:50.196
No, I'm up.

35:52.696 --> 35:54.198
Someone is looking at me.

35:55.320 --> 35:57.560
- It's the cleaning crew.
- No, on the computer.

35:57.584 --> 35:59.850
I got to shut down my UPD port.

36:02.600 --> 36:04.545
I don't think it penetrated my firewall.

36:04.569 --> 36:06.955
- What the hell is it?
- It's a botagent.

36:06.979 --> 36:08.734
It's probably one of the CIA's.

36:08.758 --> 36:10.734
Botagent... short for robotic agent.

36:10.758 --> 36:13.696
Designed to crawl the Internet
looking for snoopers like us.

36:13.720 --> 36:15.485
- This for real?
- Oh, yeah, boss.

36:15.509 --> 36:18.834
If this had penetrated my firewall,
it could have downloaded my hard drive.

36:18.858 --> 36:21.502
The CIA would have all our data,
and know we were onto Lodestone.

36:21.526 --> 36:23.887
- Can you kill it?
- No, though I could build

36:23.911 --> 36:27.479
a mirror to my firewall, so that when
it looks in, it could just see itself.

36:27.503 --> 36:30.374
- How long?
- Too long.

36:31.247 --> 36:33.453
Or I could use another computer.

36:34.736 --> 36:36.047
Boss, just one thing...

36:36.071 --> 36:38.990
There's always just one thing, McGee.

36:39.014 --> 36:42.211
A really smart botagent
won't just sit on my computer.

36:42.235 --> 36:45.165
It'll look for my search
patterns on the Internet.

36:45.189 --> 36:47.612
This is like tracking a dirtbag, McGee.

36:47.636 --> 36:50.826
You stake out his house.
You put out a BOLO.

36:50.850 --> 36:53.049
Keep tabs on the girl.

36:53.759 --> 36:55.499
Never thought of it that way.

36:55.717 --> 36:57.134
Start a new search.

36:57.362 --> 36:58.453
Okay.

36:58.671 --> 37:01.105
- What am I looking for?
- The girlfriend...

37:01.340 --> 37:02.548
Jenny Shepard.

37:04.700 --> 37:07.582
When you look at me like that, McGee,

37:07.985 --> 37:11.291
I get this overwhelming
urge to head slap you.

37:23.720 --> 37:26.775
I am going to get...

37:26.970 --> 37:28.984
a ding...

37:30.007 --> 37:31.141
now!

37:34.013 --> 37:36.895
You guys are doing this
because it's the weekend.

37:37.358 --> 37:40.369
And you think if you just
stall, then I'll give up

37:40.393 --> 37:45.012
and I'll finish the search on Monday,
but that is not going to happen.

37:45.694 --> 37:46.734
Abby...

37:47.540 --> 37:48.614
you worry me.

37:49.638 --> 37:53.240
Oh, they know I'm just, you know,
talking to them to pass the time.

37:53.264 --> 37:57.138
Because at this point, the fingerprint
match is totally up to AFIS.

37:57.519 --> 37:58.677
Right, guys?

37:59.046 --> 38:00.338
Right, guys?

38:00.891 --> 38:02.363
I'm just joshing you, Director.

38:02.387 --> 38:04.366
I spoiled your Friday night.

38:04.769 --> 38:08.382
Oh, you know, I was
just hanging at the bar.

38:08.406 --> 38:11.740
And I probably would have been completely
passed out by now if I'd stayed.

38:11.764 --> 38:13.256
Joshing me again?

38:13.575 --> 38:14.633
No.

38:15.892 --> 38:16.892
Yes.

38:19.232 --> 38:21.724
- How many prints?
- Two sets.

38:22.009 --> 38:25.598
He poured with his left hand and
held the glass with his right.

38:26.033 --> 38:27.888
Left-handed? Or ambidextrous.

38:27.912 --> 38:29.987
I can pour with either hand.

38:30.011 --> 38:31.766
I can tell you he's not military.

38:31.790 --> 38:35.039
AFIS would have gotten a match
on anyone on active duty by now.

38:35.063 --> 38:36.432
What if he was retired?

38:36.456 --> 38:37.806
Covered them, too.

38:37.830 --> 38:39.309
Dead?

38:39.707 --> 38:41.105
Dead?

38:41.455 --> 38:43.186
You said this wasn't a case.

38:43.455 --> 38:44.797
It's not.

38:44.999 --> 38:50.353
I want you to expand the search to
include servicemen alive prior to '95.

38:53.570 --> 38:54.577
Okay.

38:59.612 --> 39:01.495
I don't see any signs of concussion.

39:01.519 --> 39:03.519
I've been hit harder by my sister.

39:04.267 --> 39:05.431
You don't have a sister.

39:05.455 --> 39:06.740
I don't?

39:07.327 --> 39:08.899
Nick...

39:09.923 --> 39:11.869
Enough playing, Doctor.

39:14.294 --> 39:16.183
Do it. I don't want you to get hurt.

39:16.207 --> 39:17.265
Let's go.

39:27.209 --> 39:29.332
Half K of pure horse in here, Doc.

39:29.521 --> 39:30.785
I'm no surgeon.

39:30.809 --> 39:33.121
I'm not asking you to save a life, Doc.

39:34.530 --> 39:35.614
Maybe I am.

39:35.638 --> 39:37.444
Come on, come on, come on!

39:37.468 --> 39:39.474
Quit stalling. He doesn't have AIDS.

39:39.498 --> 39:41.824
That's not what the mask's for.

39:42.226 --> 39:43.955
What's it for?

39:45.211 --> 39:46.663
Turn around, Bernie.

39:47.273 --> 39:48.442
Please hurry.

39:49.211 --> 39:50.871
Why the mask?

39:50.895 --> 39:53.486
Tell her to turn around.

39:53.510 --> 39:54.667
Do it, Bernie.

39:56.261 --> 39:58.420
The mask is to protect
me from disease spread

39:58.444 --> 40:01.430
by airborne particles
released when I open him up.

40:10.646 --> 40:11.977
No more stalling.

40:28.996 --> 40:30.893
Devon died bringing this to you.

40:31.564 --> 40:32.632
Want it?

40:32.656 --> 40:34.488
What the hell do you think?

40:40.154 --> 40:41.245
Bitch!

40:47.531 --> 40:50.115
Next one's in your ear.

40:52.065 --> 40:53.463
Drop it.

40:57.403 --> 40:58.403
You okay?

41:00.113 --> 41:01.187
Not really.

41:06.715 --> 41:07.850
Oh, God.

41:33.138 --> 41:34.245
Who's this?

41:35.085 --> 41:38.592
It's uh, Director's father...
Colonel Jasper Shepard.

41:40.588 --> 41:41.894
You don't know him?

41:43.277 --> 41:44.942
She never talked family.

41:44.966 --> 41:46.462
It's like you.

41:49.659 --> 41:51.304
She has his eyes.

41:51.718 --> 41:53.016
He still alive?

41:57.530 --> 41:58.530
Deceased.

42:00.403 --> 42:01.697
Suicide,

42:02.041 --> 42:03.367
12 years ago.

42:25.969 --> 42:27.656
- There she goes.
- Who?

42:27.958 --> 42:29.008
Sarah.

42:29.032 --> 42:31.914
Security found her sleeping
in the delivery room.

42:41.657 --> 42:44.835
You should be under
observation for 24 hours.

42:45.338 --> 42:47.167
Whatever doctor orders.

42:51.094 --> 42:52.094
What's this?

42:53.478 --> 42:54.846
My secret.

42:58.328 --> 42:59.910
Bonjour, Papa.

43:01.299 --> 43:02.675
Bonjour, ma fille.

43:05.713 --> 43:08.063
So this must be Anthony DiNardo.

43:12.074 --> 43:13.822
Welcome to the family,

43:14.326 --> 43:15.970
Professeur.
