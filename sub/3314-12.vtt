WEBVTT

00:07.048 --> 00:11.131
I HAVE A GOOD FEELING ABOUT THIS ONE.
THIS IS THE MONTH I'VE BEEN IMPREGNIFIED.

00:11.132 --> 00:12.932
THAT'S NOT A WORD.

00:12.933 --> 00:15.635
HEY, IF I CAN MAKE A HUMAN BEING
INSIDE OF ME, I CAN MAKE UP WORDS.

00:15.636 --> 00:17.807
AND I'M TELLING YOU, ALL
THE SIGNS ARE THERE.

00:17.808 --> 00:21.441
MY BOOBS ARE BIGGER, MY SHOES DON'T FIT.
AND I'VE BEEN MOODIER LATELY.

00:21.442 --> 00:22.733
HAVE YOU NOTICED?

00:23.854 --> 00:27.147
- OF COURSE NOT, MY DARLING.
- AWW, SMART MAN.

00:27.148 --> 00:29.699
YES, AND WE'LL KNOW IF YOU ARE
PREGNANT OR NOT IN 21 SECONDS.

00:29.700 --> 00:30.780
OH, I'M PREGNANT.

00:30.781 --> 00:33.203
YEP, I'VE GOT THE SWOLLEN
FEET AND FOOD CRAVINGS.

00:33.204 --> 00:35.155
I DIDN'T TELL YOU THIS, BUT AT 2:00 A.M.
THE OTHER NIGHT,

00:35.156 --> 00:37.367
I ATE HALF A POUND OF PASTRAMI.

00:37.368 --> 00:39.499
ACTUALLY, IT WAS 2:30.

00:39.500 --> 00:42.832
I MEAN, I HAD NO CLUE.
ONLY SEVEN SECONDS TO GO.

00:42.833 --> 00:46.876
OOH, HERE, LET'S TAKE A PICTURE
OF THE MOMENT WE FIND OUT

00:46.877 --> 00:50.009
THAT WE ARE GOING TO...

00:50.010 --> 00:52.882
- NOT HAVE A BABY.
- HUH.

00:52.883 --> 00:55.765
I THOUGHT THAT LAST BLAST OF MY
LITTLE LONGOS WAS GONNA DO THE TRICK.

00:55.766 --> 00:57.308
I EVEN GAVE THEM A PEP
TALK AND EVERYTHING.

00:58.599 --> 00:59.890
DON'T PICTURE THAT.

01:00.891 --> 01:04.274
YOU KNOW, WHEN I USED TO GET A NEGATIVE
RESULT ON A PREGNANCY TEST IT WAS "WOO-HOO."

01:04.275 --> 01:05.946
AND NOW IT'S "BOO-HOO."

01:07.568 --> 01:10.150
WELL, LOOK AT THIS WAY, ALL RIGHT, NOW
THAT WE KNOW YOU'RE NOT PREGNANT,

01:10.151 --> 01:12.992
TONIGHT WE CAN OPEN UP A BOTTLE
OF WINE, PUT ON SOME MUSIC,

01:12.993 --> 01:14.865
AND TRY THIS WHOLE
THING ALL OVER AGAIN.

01:16.457 --> 01:19.959
YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE THIS MEANS?
THESE SHOES ACTUALLY DON'T FIT.

01:19.960 --> 01:22.122
AND I WORE THEM OUTSIDE!
I CAN'T RETURN THEM!

01:22.123 --> 01:24.125
UGH, IT JUST GETS
WORSE AND WORSE.

JOE! I SAW MY DOCTOR TODAY.

01:51.652 --> 01:56.035
WELL, TECHNICALLY I WAS WATCHING DR. OZ
ON MY PHONE DURING A CITY COUNCIL VOTE.

01:56.036 --> 01:58.948
ANYWAY, THE OZ-MAN RECOMMENDED A WHOLE
NEW METHOD OF GETTING PREGNANT.

01:58.949 --> 02:00.910
"DO IT AS MUCH AS YOU CAN."

02:00.911 --> 02:02.952
(claps) SOLD.

02:02.953 --> 02:04.744
- DON'T YOU WANT TO HEAR THE
SCIENCE BEHIND IT? -NOPE.

02:04.745 --> 02:07.006
I MEAN, WE'RE TALKING THREE,
FOUR TIMES A DAY, EVERY DAY.

02:07.007 --> 02:08.748
HONEY, WILL YOU STOP TALKING?
I'M ON BOARD.

02:08.749 --> 02:11.421
THAT'S FUNNY, USUALLY YOU WON'T SHUT
UP ABOUT THE SCIENCE WE SEE ON TV.

02:11.422 --> 02:13.884
THAT'S SHARK WEEK! THAT'S
A WHOLE DIFFERENT THING.

02:18.849 --> 02:21.641
HEY, RYDER. EVERYTHING
OKAY AT AMERICORPS?

02:21.642 --> 02:25.855
EAH, I JUST HAVE TO ASK OU SOMETHING.
IT'S ABOUT GIRLS.

02:25.856 --> 02:28.648
OH, SURE. THEY'RE THE ONES WITH
THE BUMPY THINGS ON THEIR FRONTS.

02:28.649 --> 02:30.190
YEAH, NO, I KNOW.

02:30.191 --> 02:32.572
BUT JULIET KEEPS COMPLAINING
ABOUT US HAVING PROBLEMS,

02:32.573 --> 02:35.075
BUT THE ONLY PROBLEM I CAN SEE
IS THINGS ARE "TOO GOOD."

02:36.076 --> 02:40.910
YES, GIRLS ARE ALWAYS COMPLAINING
ABOUT THINGS BEING "TOO GOOD."

02:40.911 --> 02:43.703
- WHAT DOES SHE SAY IS WRONG?
- I'M NOT TOTALLY SURE.

02:43.704 --> 02:46.086
SEE, WHEN SHE TALKS ABOUT "THE
RELATIONSHIP" I KINDA DON'T LISTEN.

02:47.958 --> 02:50.381
WELL, RIGHT THERE IS SOLID
EVIDENCE THAT THINGS ARE TOO GOOD.

02:51.842 --> 02:54.754
- WHY DON'T YOU LISTEN?
- EVERYTHING'S FINE! I MEAN, IT'S FINE.

02:54.755 --> 02:56.847
SO, OBVIOUSLY, LISTENING WOULD
JUST BE A WASTE OF TIME.

02:58.599 --> 03:01.471
RYDER, DO YOU LIKE
KISSING JULIET?

03:01.472 --> 03:04.225
- YEAH. -DO YOU LIKE ALL OF THE
STUFF THAT COMES AFTER THE KISSING?

03:05.396 --> 03:06.726
OH, YEAH.

03:06.727 --> 03:09.729
WELL, THEN I HATE TO BREAK IT TO YOU, BUT
IF YOU WANT TO KEEP DOING THE FUN STUFF,

03:09.730 --> 03:11.902
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE
TO LISTEN TO HER.

03:13.274 --> 03:14.315
THERE'S GOTTA BE AN EASIER WAY.

03:16.777 --> 03:19.158
ISN'T THERE SOME KIND OF SECRET
WAY TO HAVE A RELATIONSHIP

03:19.159 --> 03:22.032
WITHOUT ALL OF THE
MEH MEH MEH MEH?

03:23.123 --> 03:26.035
GIRLS ARE NOT VIDEO GAMES.
THERE ARE NO CHEAT CODES.

03:26.036 --> 03:27.877
YOU HAVE TO PLAY EVERY LEVEL.

03:27.878 --> 03:30.591
INCLUDING "LISTENING TO THE
GIRL WHO'S TALKING TO YOU."

03:33.003 --> 03:35.595
RYDER? RYDER!

03:35.596 --> 03:37.258
DIE, YOU SCUMBAGS!

03:38.839 --> 03:40.930
ARE YOU PLAYING A
VIDEO GAME RIGHT NOW?

03:40.931 --> 03:43.893
- WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO
DO WITH ANYTHING? -RYDER!

03:43.894 --> 03:46.727
YES, YES. IF YOU MUST KNOW,
I'M KILLING VAMPIRE NAZIS.

03:48.108 --> 03:51.150
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE DOING THAT WHEN
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING IMPORTANT.

03:51.151 --> 03:53.062
YOU SOUND JUST LIKE JULIET.

03:53.063 --> 03:55.155
WOMEN DON'T GET IT.
I CAN MULTI-TASK.

03:56.487 --> 03:58.488
GOOD. KEEP NOT
LISTENING TO JULIET

03:58.489 --> 04:01.492
AND YOU'LL BE KILLING VAMPIRE NAZIS
WHILE MULTI-TASKING YOURSELF.

04:05.536 --> 04:09.370
WHOO! OH, THAT'S WHAT
I CALL THE HAT TRICK.

04:10.671 --> 04:12.832
THAT'S THE BEST ONE YET. I GOTTA
TELL YOU SOMETHING SWEETY

04:12.833 --> 04:16.006
THIS IS WHAT I ALWAYS DREAMED
THAT MARRIAGE WOULD BE LIKE.

04:17.838 --> 04:20.970
- WELL, GOOD NIGHT.
- WAIT WAIT, CHAMP, HOLD ON.

04:20.971 --> 04:22.512
I WANT TO SHOW YOU SOMETHING.

04:22.513 --> 04:25.345
I MADE A GETTING PREGNANT SCHEDULE
THAT SAYS WHEN WE SHOULD HAVE SEX.

04:25.346 --> 04:27.308
IT'S SORT OF A "TO DO ME" LIST.

04:28.309 --> 04:30.390
THAT'S AMAZING, I
AGREE TO EVERYTHING.

04:30.391 --> 04:32.352
- GOOD NIGHT.
- OKAY, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT. SO,

04:32.353 --> 04:34.484
FIRST THING IN THE MORNING
WE SHOWER TOGETHER.

04:34.485 --> 04:36.857
AND IT'S A VERY DIRTY SHOWER.
GET IT?

04:39.320 --> 04:41.901
THAT'S RIGHT. REST UP
MY SWEET BABY MAKER.

04:41.902 --> 04:43.784
REPLENISH. REPLENISH.

04:51.462 --> 04:54.834
- WHAT? WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
- WE'RE MAKING A BABY.

04:54.835 --> 04:57.967
NO, NO, CAN I JUST
BRUSH MY TEETH FIRST?

04:57.968 --> 05:00.880
- SO I CAN ENJOY IT? -ENJOYING
IT WILL NOT MAKE A BABY.

05:00.881 --> 05:03.803
NO, NO! IT'LL JUST
TAKE A SECOND, HONEY.

05:03.804 --> 05:05.885
SCHEDULE, JOE, SCHEDULE.

05:05.886 --> 05:07.768
THE SEX TRAIN MUST RUN ON TIME.

05:10.521 --> 05:14.274
THERE HE IS! UPSTAIRS!
IT'S STUD TIME.

05:15.646 --> 05:17.437
(sighs) I DON'T KNOW...

05:17.438 --> 05:21.401
WHAT DO YOU MEAN? "I DON'T KNOW?" WE'RE
ON A SCHEDULE. LET'S GO, LET'S GO!

05:21.402 --> 05:23.824
"LET'S GO, LET'S GO." THAT'S
YOUR IDEA OF FOREPLAY?

05:25.906 --> 05:28.078
I THOUGHT THIS WAS THE MARRIAGE
YOU ALWAYS DREAMED IT WOULD BE?

05:30.581 --> 05:31.872
IT IS.

05:32.913 --> 05:35.915
YOU KNOW, IT'S JUST... I
MEAN IT BE NICE IF YOU...

05:35.916 --> 05:37.668
ASK ME ABOUT HOW
MY DAY WAS FIRST.

05:40.300 --> 05:43.843
ALL RIGHT, THAT'S
ABSOLUTELY FAIR.

05:43.844 --> 05:47.677
HOW WAS YOUR DAY? DID YOU GET
ANY WRITING DONE IN YOUR BOOK?

05:47.678 --> 05:49.178
- LITTLE BIT.
- OH GOOD, GOOD.

05:49.179 --> 05:55.145
AND DID YOU WORK THINGS OUT WITH
THAT CLIENT THAT WAS BOTHERING YOU?

05:56.897 --> 06:00.030
- WHICH ONE?
- OH, YOU KNOW WHICH ONE.

06:07.828 --> 06:10.580
- OH, THE ONE WITH THE CROOKED NOSE
AND THE ARMS AND THE LEGS? -EXACTLY.

06:10.581 --> 06:13.793
HA! I KNEW YOU WEREN'T ASKING
ABOUT ANYBODY IN PARTICULAR,

06:13.794 --> 06:16.876
YOU'RE JUST FAKE ASKING ME
QUESTIONS SO I'LL GIVE YOU SEX.

06:16.877 --> 06:19.208
WHAT? NO! I WOULD NEVER DO THAT!

06:19.209 --> 06:21.260
AND JUST TO PROVE IT, AS
SOON WE GET DONE UPSTAIRS

06:21.261 --> 06:24.964
I AM GONNA YOU ORDER YOU THAT FANCY
COOKING THING YOU'VE HAD YOUR EYE ON.

06:24.965 --> 06:27.677
OH, I SEE. SO, YOU THINK I CAN BE
BOUGHT FOR A FOUR QUART DOUBLE BROILER

06:27.678 --> 06:29.179
WITH A COPPER CORE AND
PASTA PENTOLA INSERT.

06:31.311 --> 06:32.933
- I WAS HOPING.
- ALL RIGHT, JUST THIS ONCE.

06:36.607 --> 06:39.939
THERE'S NO WAY WE CAN'T BE PREGNANT
THIS MONTH. I MEAN, WE DID IT 47 TIMES.

06:39.940 --> 06:42.151
I COUNTED 48.

06:42.152 --> 06:44.784
OH NO, MY BAD, THAT ONE
CAN'T MAKE A BABY.

06:44.785 --> 06:47.867
- THAT WAS JUST A LITTLE THANK YOU
GIFT FROM ME TO YOU. -THANK YOU.

06:47.868 --> 06:49.909
- (timer dings)
- OH!

06:49.910 --> 06:52.583
DAMN IT! ALL OF THAT
DOING IT FOR NOTHING.

06:55.496 --> 06:56.917
I MEAN, YOU KNOW,
EXCEPT FOR THE FUN.

07:07.468 --> 07:09.969
RYDER! WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

07:09.970 --> 07:12.011
I MISSED HOME.

07:12.012 --> 07:14.894
I WANTED TO BE BACK HOME,
WITH EVERYTHING THAT I LOVED.

07:14.895 --> 07:17.727
- AWW, THAT IS SO SWEET.
- LIKE THIS COUCH.

07:17.728 --> 07:21.821
DID I JUST HEAR RYDER'S VOICE?
MY BABY!

07:21.822 --> 07:24.233
HEY, WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY
HI WHEN YOU GOT IN, MAN?

07:24.234 --> 07:26.986
- WHY DIDN'T YOU CALL? -WELL, I
WANTED IT TO BE A SURPRISE.

07:26.987 --> 07:28.619
THANKS FOR RUINING IT.

07:29.780 --> 07:31.951
RYDER, DON'T LET THIS
GO TO YOUR HEAD,

07:31.952 --> 07:34.874
BUT IT'S SORT OF
NICE TO SEE YOU.

07:34.875 --> 07:37.578
COME HERE, GET IN MY
LAP LIKE YOU USED TO.

07:41.461 --> 07:45.004
AUNT MEL, I DON'T KNOW ANY OTHER WAY TO
SAY THIS, BUT YOU'RE HURTING MY JUNK.

07:45.005 --> 07:46.927
OOH, SORRY!

07:48.388 --> 07:50.089
YOU KNOW I'M SO GLAD THAT
YOU CAME TO VISIT US, MAN.

07:50.090 --> 07:52.011
BUT WHEN ARE YOU HEADING
BACK TO AMERICORPS?

07:52.012 --> 07:54.855
YEAH, FUNNY YOU SHOULD ASK
THAT, CUZ NEVER. I QUIT.

07:58.018 --> 07:59.479
WHY YOU GUYS ALL LOOKING AT ME?

08:01.902 --> 08:03.443
IS THERE SOMETHING
YOU'RE NOT TELLING ME?

08:06.817 --> 08:09.779
SO, THEN JULIET SAID SHE WAS
DUMPING ME, SO I QUIT AMERICORPS.

08:09.780 --> 08:12.412
I MEAN, WHAT'S THE POINT IN HELPING
PEOPLE IF THERE'S NOTHING IN IT FOR ME?

08:14.665 --> 08:16.746
SO, YOU QUIT OVER A GIRL?

08:16.747 --> 08:18.578
A VERY, VERY HOT GIRL.

08:18.579 --> 08:22.672
JOE, HE'S JUST HAD HIS HEART BROKEN, ALL
RIGHT? LEAVE MY LITTLE NEPHEW ALONE.

08:22.673 --> 08:25.005
LITTLE? MEL, HE'S SIX -FOOT, 13.

08:26.927 --> 08:28.839
AUNT MEL, ARE YOU
TRYING TO BURP ME?

08:29.930 --> 08:32.892
SORRY, I'VE GOT
BABIES ON THE BRAIN.

08:32.893 --> 08:35.094
SO WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO WITH
YOURSELF NOW THAT YOU'RE HOME?

08:35.095 --> 08:38.017
WELL, I'M GOING TO SHOW JULIET THAT SHE
MADE A HUGE MISTAKE FOR DUMPING ME

08:38.018 --> 08:40.269
JUST BECAUSE THAT GUY HAD
A DUCATI MOTORCYCLE.

08:40.270 --> 08:43.062
- SHE LEFT YOU BECAUSE HE HAD A MOTORCYCLE
- YEAH. HOW SUPERFICIAL IS THAT?

08:43.063 --> 08:44.855
AH, THAT'S A PRETTY HOT BIKE.

08:46.146 --> 08:47.777
I'M SORRY, GO ON.

08:47.778 --> 08:51.240
EVERY DAY THIS DOUCHE RIDES HIS FANCY
MOTORCYCLE TO HIS INTERNET START UP

08:51.241 --> 08:55.244
WHERE HE KEEPS FINDING NEW WAYS TO PROVIDE
FRESH WATER TO STARVING CHILDREN.

08:55.245 --> 08:58.959
I MEAN, HE'S ALL LIKE, "LOOK AT ME, I'M 23.
I'M SAVING THE WORLD."

09:00.500 --> 09:02.331
SO, OUT OF ALL OF THAT,
WHAT YOU GOT WAS

09:02.332 --> 09:04.794
SHE'S LEAVING ME BECAUSE
THE GUY HAS A MOTORCYCLE?

09:04.795 --> 09:07.547
YEAH, LIKE, WHAT IS UP
WITH HER PRIORITIES?

09:08.929 --> 09:13.012
RYDER, IT'S NOT ABOUT A MOTORCYCLE.
IT'S ABOUT A PERSON HAVING DRIVE.

09:13.013 --> 09:15.384
A LIFE PATH. A GOAL.

09:15.385 --> 09:18.938
I DO HAVE A GOAL. TO SHOW
JULIET WHAT SHE'S MISSING.

09:18.939 --> 09:20.600
YEAH, I'M SURE YOU DO
PAL, BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

09:20.601 --> 09:22.642
I'M NOT HEARING ANY PLANS
SO I'M GONNA GIVE YOU ONE.

09:22.643 --> 09:25.354
YOU'RE GOING TO DO WHAT YOUR AUNT MEL
AND I ORIGINALLY SUGGESTED THAT YOU DO.

09:25.355 --> 09:26.816
YOU'RE GOING TO
APPLY TO COLLEGE.

09:26.817 --> 09:29.399
JOE, I CAN PLAN MY OWN FUTURE, OKAY?
I AM AN ADULT.

09:31.401 --> 09:33.904
IS THERE NOT A SINGLE JUICE
BOX IN THIS ENTIRE HOUSE?

09:36.997 --> 09:41.370
LISTEN TO ME, IN THREE WEEKS, THE NEXT SEMESTER
AT TOLEDO COMMUNITY COLLEGE WILL BEGIN.

09:41.371 --> 09:44.203
ALL RIGHT, AND YOU'RE GOING
TO BE MAJORING IN THIS.

09:44.204 --> 09:46.545
- KUNG PAO CHICKEN?
- WHAT? NO.

09:46.546 --> 09:48.628
SORRY, THAT'S THE
WRONG BROCHURE.

09:48.629 --> 09:51.380
I THINK WHAT JOE IS TRYING TO SAY IS THAT
WE JUST WANT YOU TO COME UP WITH A PLAN

09:51.381 --> 09:53.673
- FOR YOUR LIFE. THAT MAKES YOU HAPPY.
RIGHT JOE? -NOPE.

09:53.674 --> 09:57.346
WHAT I'M SAYING IS, UNLESS YOU FIND AN
ALTERNATIVE PLAN IN THE NEXT THREE WEEKS,

09:57.347 --> 09:59.889
I'M GOING TO BE PUTTING YOU
INTO TOLEDO COMMUNITY COLLEGE,

09:59.890 --> 10:02.352
AND YOU'RE GOING TO
BE MAJORING IN...

10:03.393 --> 10:05.986
GERIATRIC MASSAGE.

10:09.489 --> 10:11.732
HEY, MAN, OLD PEOPLE
NEED TO BE TOUCHED, TOO.

10:16.737 --> 10:18.659
ALL RIGHT, NEW
PREGNANCY STRATEGY.

10:19.870 --> 10:21.911
I SEE WE'RE BEYOND SAYING HELLO.

10:21.912 --> 10:23.913
NO TIME, TOO EXCITED.

10:23.914 --> 10:25.745
WE'RE GOING TO TRY A
NEW FERTILITY METHOD.

10:25.746 --> 10:28.799
MY FRIEND CHERYL DOWN IN ANIMAL CONTROL
SWEARS BY IT, AND SHE'S GOT, LIKE, NINE KIDS.

10:29.960 --> 10:34.303
THAT'S GREAT. I DON'T THINK WE NEED
NINE KIDS, BUT HOW DO THEY DO IT?

10:34.304 --> 10:37.556
YOU SAVE UP ALL YOUR LITTLE GUYS AND THEN
YOU LET THEM ALL LOOSE AT THE SAME TIME.

10:37.557 --> 10:41.681
OH, I LIKE THAT. ALL RIGHT, SO WE'LL GO EVERY
OTHER NIGHT SO I HAVE A LITTLE TIME TO STOCKPILE?

10:41.682 --> 10:43.973
NO, NO, NO, NONE OF THIS
"EVERY OTHER NIGHT" STUFF.

10:43.974 --> 10:47.937
NO, WE'RE WAITING UNTIL MY PEAK OVULATION!
WINDOW, AND THEN, KA-BLOOEY!

10:47.938 --> 10:50.359
MY UTERUS WON'T
KNOW WHAT HIT IT.

10:50.360 --> 10:52.191
SOUNDS GOOD. WHEN'S YOUR
PEAK OVULATION WINDOW?

10:52.192 --> 10:54.033
OKAY, WELL, ACCORDING TO
MY NEW APP, STORK TRACKER,

10:54.034 --> 10:56.826
- WHICH WAS FREE BY THE WAY.
- SO WE KNOW IT WORKS.

10:56.827 --> 10:59.328
GIVEN MY LAST MENSTRUAL PERIOD
AND CURRENT BASAL TEMPERATURE,

10:59.329 --> 11:02.371
WE ARE LOOKING AT 10 DAYS, FOUR
HOURS AND 17 MINUTES FROM NOW.

11:02.372 --> 11:06.336
PERFECT! HEY, WAIT, JUST SO I'M CLEAR,
YOU SAID "17 MINUTES" FROM NOW, RIGHT?

11:08.088 --> 11:10.459
NO, 10 DAYS FROM NOW.

11:10.460 --> 11:12.922
WHAT? 10 DAYS?

11:12.923 --> 11:15.345
HONEY, LONGO CAN'T GO 10 DAYS.

11:16.506 --> 11:18.848
LONGO'S GONNA HAVE TO.

11:18.849 --> 11:22.261
LOOK, THAT MEANS A WEEK
FROM THURSDAY AT 8:20 P.M.

11:22.262 --> 11:24.804
THAT'S WHEN OUR NEXT SEX APPOINTMENT
IS, OKAY? AND NO CHEATING!

11:24.805 --> 11:26.977
BECAUSE I NEED EVERY SINGLE
ONE OF YOUR LITTLE SWIMMERS.

11:27.898 --> 11:29.149
ALL RIGHT, CAN YOU HANDLE THAT?

11:30.270 --> 11:33.112
- 10 DAYS FROM NOW?
- CAN YOU DO IT, JOE?

11:33.113 --> 11:35.815
IT'S FOR THE FUTURE,
IT'S FOR THE FAMILY.

11:35.816 --> 11:37.277
IT'S FOR THE LONGO BLOODLINE.

11:38.278 --> 11:41.781
ALL RIGHT, YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU
PUT IT THAT WAY? I AM ALL IN.

11:41.782 --> 11:42.992
STARTING IN FIVE MINUTES.

11:42.993 --> 11:45.786
GET BACK HERE. HANDS
WHERE I CAN SEE THEM.

11:57.637 --> 11:59.840
REALLY? YOU'RE MAKING
TWO SANDWICHES?

12:00.891 --> 12:03.013
NO, WHAT DO YOU THINK I AM, A PIG?
I'M ONLY MAKING ONE.

12:05.976 --> 12:08.848
WAIT. BEFORE JULIET WENT
OFF WITH THE DUCATI GUY,

12:08.849 --> 12:11.311
DID SHE KNOW YOU COULD
MAKE SANDWICHES LIKE THIS?

12:12.402 --> 12:14.024
CLEARLY YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHAT I AM DOING HERE.

12:15.155 --> 12:17.356
NO, RYDER, I DON'T.

12:17.357 --> 12:19.278
OKAY, YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO
BE MAKING A LIFE PLAN.

12:19.279 --> 12:22.992
BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T, JOE IS SIGNING YOU
UP FOR CLASSES IN MORTUARY SCIENCE.

12:22.993 --> 12:24.824
I THOUGHT HE SAID
GERIATRIC MASSAGE?

12:24.825 --> 12:26.827
IS THERE REALLY A
BIG DIFFERENCE?

12:32.292 --> 12:35.004
- WHOO! YEAH!
- HEY. SO, HOW'S IT GOING?

12:35.005 --> 12:37.466
GOOD. THAT WAS A REALLY,
REALLY GOOD RUN.

12:37.467 --> 12:39.088
BETTER THAN MY FIRST
TWO RUNS OF THE DAY.

12:39.089 --> 12:43.222
I GOTTA TELL YOU SOMETHING, HONEY. THIS
WHOLE ABSTINENCE THING IS LIKE A SNAP.

12:43.223 --> 12:46.345
AW, I AM SO PROUD OF YOU. WELL, I AM JUST
GOING TO GO UPSTAIRS AND TAKE A SHOWER.

12:46.346 --> 12:48.727
YOU'RE GOING TO GO TAKE A
SHOWER, ARE YOU? OKAY.

12:48.728 --> 12:50.810
SO YOU'LL BE IN THE SHOWER THEN?
THAT'LL BE OKAY, GOOD.

12:50.811 --> 12:52.771
YOU'LL BE NAKED, OBVIOUSLY.

12:52.772 --> 12:55.394
WITH THE WATER KIND OF
RUNNING OVER YOUR...

12:55.395 --> 12:58.697
SO, YOU'LL BE LATHERING
UP CERTAIN PARTS...

12:58.698 --> 13:00.110
I'M GOING FOR ANOTHER RUN.

13:03.743 --> 13:07.286
- HEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
- UNCLOGGING THE TOILET.

13:07.287 --> 13:10.329
DRESSED ALL SEXY LIKE THAT?
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?

13:10.330 --> 13:13.003
YOU'RE KILLING ME! GO! GO!

13:13.964 --> 13:16.756
OH, DON'T SHAKE IT LIKE THAT!

13:20.800 --> 13:22.011
JOE, CAN YOU BUTTER MY BAGEL?

13:22.012 --> 13:24.974
YES, IT'S TIME. THANK GOD!
LET'S DO IT.

13:24.975 --> 13:27.476
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? -WHAT
DO YOU MEAN WHAT AM I TALKING ABOUT?

13:27.477 --> 13:29.188
YOU JUST ASKED ME TO
BUTTER YOUR BAGEL.

13:29.189 --> 13:31.020
SINCE WHEN IS "BUTTER
MY BAGEL" A EUPHEMISM?

13:31.021 --> 13:33.273
AFTER NINE DAYS,
EVERYTHING IS A EUPHEMISM.

13:34.694 --> 13:36.987
FINE, I'LL JUST
BUTTER MY OWN BAGEL.

13:38.899 --> 13:40.941
IF YOU'RE GOOD,
I'LL LET YOU WATCH.

13:42.863 --> 13:43.994
SUCH A TEASE.

13:48.288 --> 13:51.661
SEX FREE IS STRESS FREE.
SEX IS AN ILLUSION.

13:53.503 --> 13:57.046
OKAY, TONIGHT'S THE NIGHT.
YOU'RE SENDING YOUR BOYS IN.

13:57.047 --> 13:58.217
HALLELUJAH!

13:58.218 --> 14:01.010
SO STORK TRACKER SAYS I
WILL BE AT PEAK OVULATION

14:01.011 --> 14:02.461
IN NINE HOURS AND SIX MINUTES.

14:02.462 --> 14:04.763
THAT IS SO GREAT! THAT IS SO GREAT!
AND, HEY, TONIGHT'S THE NIGHT

14:04.764 --> 14:07.266
WE ALSO SET OUT CLOCKS
FORWARD AN HOUR, TOO, RIGHT?

14:07.267 --> 14:10.639
SORRY, NO. BUT YOU WANNA KNOW
WHAT I'M GONNA DO TO YOU TONIGHT?

14:10.640 --> 14:12.972
NO, NO, NO! DON'T EVEN LOOK
AT ME RIGHT NOW, ALL RIGHT?

14:12.973 --> 14:16.066
IF I EVEN CATCH A GLIMPSE OF YOUR
BARE ELBOW IT'S LIKE BOOM TIME!

14:17.647 --> 14:20.609
SO, NO KISS THEN?

14:20.610 --> 14:22.402
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?
GET OUT OF HERE!

14:33.583 --> 14:36.085
HEY, I WAS JUST THINKING ABOUT
YOU AND HOW YOUR PEAK OVULATION

14:36.086 --> 14:38.297
IS IN 22 MINUTES AND YOU SHOULD
BE ON THE WAY HOME, RIGHT?

14:38.298 --> 14:39.798
AND I CHECKED TRAFFIC,
TRAFFIC IS MOVING GREAT.

14:39.799 --> 14:41.091
SO, YOU SHOULD BE
HOME SOON, RIGHT?

14:42.172 --> 14:44.763
UM, BAD NEWS. I'M
STUCK AT THE OFFICE.

14:44.764 --> 14:47.006
I GOT CALLED IN TO AN
EMERGENCY BUDGET NEGOTIATION.

14:47.007 --> 14:50.559
- OH NO. HOW LONG IS THAT GONNA TAKE?
- I HAVE NO IDEA.

14:50.560 --> 14:52.811
HONEY, LISTEN, I'M JUST
GONNA SAY THIS ONCE.

14:52.812 --> 14:53.933
IF YOU DON'T GET HOME SOON,

14:53.934 --> 14:56.896
THERE'S A VERY GOOD CHANCE OUR FIRST CHILD
IS GOING LOOK JUST LIKE THE VACUUM CLEANER.

15:01.071 --> 15:04.984
YES, THE RED LIGHT CAMERAS BRING A LOT OF MONEY
TO THE CITY, BUT THEY ALSO GO OFF RANDOMLY.

15:04.985 --> 15:07.906
- IT'S NOT FAIR. -I THINK THE
GLITCHES ARE EXAGGERATED.

15:07.907 --> 15:11.331
REALLY? BECAUSE SOMEWHERE OUT THERE IS
A RACCOON THAT OWES THE CITY $4,000.

15:12.582 --> 15:15.744
WELL, THE REVENUE'S GOT TO COME
FROM SOME PLACE. YOU GOT ANY IDEAS?

15:15.745 --> 15:17.416
YEAH. AS A MATTER OF FACT,
I HAVE A WHOLE PROPOSAL.

15:17.417 --> 15:18.837
WYATT, COULD YOU MAKE
A COPIES OF THIS?

15:18.838 --> 15:23.043
- YOU GOT IT, CHIEF. -AND MAKE THEM DOUBLE
SIDED, BECAUSE I CARE ABOUT THE CITY.

15:24.884 --> 15:26.845
- HEY THERE.
- JOE, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

15:26.846 --> 15:29.638
WELL, I KNOW YOU GUYS WERE ALL WORKING
LATE SO I BROUGHT EVERYBODY A LITTLE FOOD.

15:29.639 --> 15:31.851
- AW, THAT IS SO THOUGHTFUL.
- YEAH, NONE FOR YOU.

15:33.643 --> 15:36.475
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING? -WELL, TONIGHT I
KNOW YOU'RE AT YOUR PEAK FERTILITY.

15:36.476 --> 15:38.937
AND, HONEY, I THINK I'M
AT MY PEAK FERTILITY.

15:38.938 --> 15:41.610
I CAN'T JUST LEAVE IN THE MIDDLE
OF NEGOTIATIONS FOR AN HOUR.

15:41.611 --> 15:43.903
OH, TRUST ME BABE. THIS IS
NOT GOING TO TAKE AN HOUR.

15:48.658 --> 15:51.991
I GOTTA TELL YOU SOMETHING, SWEETY. THIS
HAS BEEN THE LONGEST 10 DAYS OF MY LIFE.

15:51.992 --> 15:55.125
YOU KNOW, I NEVER DREAMED WE'D CONCEIVE
OUR CHILD IN A CENTRAL SUPPLY CLOSET.

15:56.706 --> 16:00.459
I FOUND THE TONER! I
JUST NEEDED TONER.

16:00.460 --> 16:03.923
I'LL GET OUT OF YOUR WAY NOW SO YOU CAN DO
WHATEVER YOU WERE DOING. I DON'T JUDGE.

16:08.348 --> 16:10.389
WHOO! OKAY.

16:10.390 --> 16:12.261
- NO, I CAN'T DO THIS.
- WHY NOT?

16:12.262 --> 16:14.263
HE'S OUT THERE LISTENING. I
KNOW HE'S OUT THERE LISTENING.

16:14.264 --> 16:17.357
ARE YOU KIDDING? WHAT KIND OF FREAK
WOULD BE OUTSIDE THE DOOR LISTENING?

16:18.938 --> 16:20.060
HELLO.

16:23.983 --> 16:25.365
WE'RE GONNA FIND
SOME OTHER PLACE.

16:32.952 --> 16:36.955
SO, LET ME GUESS. ENDLESSLY PLAYING VIDEO
GAMES IS THE LIFE PLAN YOU CAME UP WITH?

16:36.956 --> 16:39.828
OH, NO. MY PLAN IS COMPLETE.

16:39.829 --> 16:43.582
I'M JUST REWARDING MYSELF
FOR A JOB WELL DONE.

16:43.583 --> 16:46.425
ADMIT IT, RYDER. YOU HAVE
NO LIFE PLAN AT ALL.

16:46.426 --> 16:49.049
OH YEAH? THEN WHAT
DO YOU CALL THIS?

16:50.680 --> 16:53.011
A TOILET PAPER ROLL.

16:53.012 --> 16:55.265
UPON WHICH, MY PLAN IS WRITTEN.
NOW, LISTEN UP.

16:56.686 --> 16:57.897
I WOULDN'T SIT THERE.

17:00.100 --> 17:02.351
OPERATION SHOW JULIET.

17:02.352 --> 17:04.903
FIRST, I'M GOING TO
WIN A NOBEL PRIZE.

17:04.904 --> 17:07.696
I CAN'T BELIEVE I
EVER DOUBTED YOU.

17:07.697 --> 17:10.989
I'M GOING TO CROSS A FLYING
SQUIRREL WITH A JAGUAR AND CREATE

17:10.990 --> 17:12.862
THE WORLD'S CUTEST SLASH
DEADLIEST ANIMAL.

17:13.863 --> 17:16.745
THAT'S HOW YOU'RE GOING
TO WIN A NOBEL PRIZE?

17:16.746 --> 17:18.157
COME ON, A FLYING JAGUAR?

17:18.158 --> 17:21.831
ONCE AMERICA HAS THAT, NO ONE WILL MESS
WITH US. IT WILL BE THE END OF WAR.

17:23.663 --> 17:25.714
THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE
GOING TO TELL JOE?

17:25.715 --> 17:27.836
YOU KNOW, AFTER THREE WEEKS,
HE'S GOING TO BE EXPECTING

17:27.837 --> 17:30.090
A BETTER PLAN THAN A
FLYING JAGU-IRREL!

17:31.801 --> 17:35.134
OKAY, CLEARLY YOU'RE NOT GETTING THIS.
I'M GONNA DRAW IT SO YOU CAN VISUALIZE.

17:35.135 --> 17:38.597
WHAT I'M VISUALIZING IS YOU
LIVING UNDER AN OVERPASS.

17:38.598 --> 17:41.600
BECAUSE THAT'S EXACTLY WHERE YOU'RE
GOING TO BE WHEN JOE KICKS YOU OUT.

17:41.601 --> 17:43.482
YOU KNOW, IF YOU'RE GOING TO
BE SO NEGATIVE ALL THE TIME,

17:43.483 --> 17:44.774
I'M NOT LETTING YOU IN
ON THE KICKSTARTER.

17:46.686 --> 17:49.067
RYDER, RYDER, LISTEN TO ME.

17:49.068 --> 17:52.992
IF YOU KEEP LIVING LIKE THIS, NO GIRL
WILL EVER WANT TO TOUCH YOU AGAIN.

17:54.654 --> 17:55.995
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT?

17:57.157 --> 18:01.910
I MEAN, NO GIRL WILL EVER WANT
TO TOUCH YOU AGAIN. EVER.

18:01.911 --> 18:05.043
OKAY, YOU NEED A PLAN.
A REAL PLAN.

18:05.044 --> 18:08.086
EVEN IF IT'S NOT FOR JULIET,
IT SHOULD BE FOR YOU.

18:08.087 --> 18:10.470
FIND SOMETHING THAT MATTERS TO YOU.
A GOAL.

18:11.711 --> 18:13.051
WHAT SHOULD I DO?

18:13.052 --> 18:14.673
ANYTHING.

18:14.674 --> 18:17.386
YOU KNOW, START SMALL. LIKE, GET YOUR
JOB BACK AT THE LASER TAG PLACE.

18:17.387 --> 18:20.099
OH YEAH, LIKE I COULD EVER MAKE A
CRAZY PLAN LIKE THAT COME TRUE.

18:22.482 --> 18:24.183
THERE'S AN OLD SAYING...

18:24.184 --> 18:28.938
A JOURNEY OF A THOUSAND STEPS STARTS
WITH YOU TAKING OFF THAT FILTHY ROBE.

18:31.110 --> 18:34.943
YOU KNOW WHAT? I CAN DO THAT.
YEAH.

18:34.944 --> 18:37.866
- I'M EVEN GONNA PUT ON PANTS. -OH,
RYDER, YOU'RE NOT WEARING ANY UNDERWEAR.

18:37.867 --> 18:38.948
WELL THAT CHANGES TODAY.

18:47.627 --> 18:50.459
YOU KNOW, BEING IN THE BACKSEAT OF MY
CAR MAKES ME FEEL LIKE I'M 16 AGAIN.

18:50.460 --> 18:52.252
- WHAT?
- I MEAN 18.

18:53.673 --> 18:55.964
- MEL, LESS TALKING, MORE
GETTING PREGNANT. -OKAY.

18:55.965 --> 18:57.516
(vibrating sound)

18:57.517 --> 18:59.558
OOH, SOMEBODY BROUGHT TOYS.

18:59.559 --> 19:01.431
NO, HONEY, I THINK THAT'S
YOUR PHONE VIBRATING.

19:02.762 --> 19:04.853

19:46.105 --> 19:49.187

19:49.188 --> 19:50.979

19:50.980 --> 19:54.113
BECAUSE THE OPTIMAL UTERINE
TEMPERATURE IS 99.6.

19:55.905 --> 19:56.776
WHAT KIND OF COP ARE YOU?

19:56.777 --> 19:59.908
MY WIFE AND I WENT
THROUGH THE SAME THING.

19:59.909 --> 20:01.910
YOU KNOW CHERYL, DOWN

20:01.911 --> 20:03.663
YES! THIS IS HER METHOD.

20:06.706 --> 20:10.499
WELL, LISTEN, YOU FOLKS OBVIOUSLY

20:10.500 --> 20:13.792

20:25.895 --> 20:29.187

20:29.188 --> 20:32.021
AH, WHAT THE HELL. WE'LL HAVE A

20:33.773 --> 20:37.116
NOTHING TO SEE HERE,
PEOPLE, MOVE ALONG!

20:39.489 --> 20:41.200
OH, THAT REALLY GETS ME GOING.

20:45.415 --> 20:46.915
I'M SO NERVOUS, I
NEED A GLASS OF WINE.

20:46.916 --> 20:49.828
NO, NO, NO, NO WINE FOR YOU.
YOU MIGHT BE PREGNANT.

20:49.829 --> 20:52.831
WHY HASN'T SCIENCE FOUND
A WORKAROUND FOR THAT?

20:52.832 --> 20:56.254
HEY, LOOK, WHATEVER
