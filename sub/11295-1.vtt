asking you out like five minutes

10:52.451 --> 10:55.320
- after he broke up with Kalie.
- ( sighs )

10:55.421 --> 10:57.989
Honestly, Nat, I don't know
how you two used to be a couple.

10:58.090 --> 11:00.925
Tess, he kissed me on the cheek
once when we were five.

11:01.027 --> 11:03.071
Besides, he didn't ask me out.

11:03.095 --> 11:05.407
He asked me to the hockey game
and to the party after.

11:05.431 --> 11:06.598
What'd you tell him?

11:06.699 --> 11:08.266
That I had plans with my dad.

11:08.367 --> 11:09.834
Right.

11:09.935 --> 11:11.580
Hey, did you tell him
about the big news yet?

11:11.604 --> 11:14.164
Oh, shoot,
I was supposed to call.

11:14.206 --> 11:15.573
Or...

11:31.023 --> 11:32.057
Oh, boy.

11:38.164 --> 11:39.464

No, no, no, no,
what I mean is...

11:51.110 --> 11:55.046
I mean that they never pick
the smartest,

11:55.147 --> 11:57.707
or the most over...
You know.

11:57.750 --> 12:00.185

No! No! No!

12:05.658 --> 12:07.192

Oh, wait a minute, you want
a different game, right?

13:30.376 --> 13:33.344
Well, there's a hockey game
this afternoon, and I thought

13:33.445 --> 13:35.190
maybe it would be good thing
to go and say thank you

13:35.214 --> 13:39.951
to everyone because
of the election and... right?

13:40.052 --> 13:43.121
I get it.

13:43.222 --> 13:46.558
Do some glad-handing,
kiss some babies.

13:49.461 --> 13:50.695
That sounds fine.

13:50.796 --> 13:54.165

14:30.569 --> 14:31.769
Hey, Marty!

14:39.245 --> 14:41.056
Should've told me
you were coming.

14:41.080 --> 14:42.757
I would've brought
another seat warmer.

14:42.781 --> 14:45.183
Oh, that's all right, Bruce.
Nice to see you, Julie.

14:45.284 --> 14:47.395
We heard Natalie's
a big winner today, too.

14:47.419 --> 14:49.320
Yes, yes, I guess she is.

14:49.421 --> 14:51.956
Guess she's gonna be working
for Sam now, huh?

14:52.057 --> 14:53.391
Maybe.

14:57.463 --> 15:00.832
You know,
we never see you
at these things.

15:00.933 --> 15:03.134
Yeah, well,
Natalie wanted to come,

15:03.235 --> 15:05.436
so it was either here or,
you know,

15:05.537 --> 15:07.639
stay home
and draw up blueprints.

15:11.010 --> 15:13.054
I can't believe
you made me come here.

15:13.078 --> 15:15.513
It's one game.

15:15.614 --> 15:16.981
Hey, Natalie.

15:19.852 --> 15:21.819
Maybe you should dip
into the school treasury

15:21.921 --> 15:23.788
and buy yourself
a shirt that fits.

15:26.258 --> 15:27.769
Maybe you should dip
into your trust fund

15:27.793 --> 15:29.260
and buy yourself a brain.

15:32.865 --> 15:35.533
<i>( cell phone rings )</i>

15:35.634 --> 15:39.103
<i>Crap. My mom's
shift ends in ten.</i>

15:39.204 --> 15:41.583
I have to go pick her up.
Are you okay?

15:41.607 --> 15:42.774
Yeah.

16:08.167 --> 16:09.477
- Yay!
- Yeah!

16:09.501 --> 16:11.169
( crowd cheering )

16:19.979 --> 16:21.556
Martin, hockey
was never this big

16:21.580 --> 16:23.325
when we were in high school,
was it?

16:23.349 --> 16:24.849
It's hard to say.

16:24.950 --> 16:27.652
We weren't the kind
to care too much.

16:29.388 --> 16:31.055
I'm freezing.

16:31.156 --> 16:33.301
I'm gonna go get us
some hot chocolates.

16:33.325 --> 16:35.560
No whipped cream, right?

16:35.661 --> 16:37.028
That's right.

16:41.533 --> 16:43.167
Let's talk shop.

16:43.268 --> 16:45.513
Jimmy Woodrow said everything
went really well today.

16:45.537 --> 16:48.106
- Oh, that's great.
- He really likes your style.

16:48.207 --> 16:50.185
He's not so keen
on your brother-in-law, though.

16:50.209 --> 16:52.143
I had to vouch for him.

16:52.244 --> 16:55.013
I'm really grateful
for what you're doing, Bruce.

16:55.114 --> 16:57.158
I'm not doing anything,
all right?

16:57.182 --> 16:59.694
Just introducing
a hardworking friend

16:59.718 --> 17:02.420
to a client who needs
some hard work done.

17:02.521 --> 17:04.332
A lot more's gonna
come from this.

17:04.356 --> 17:07.425
Once the neighbors see this
beautiful pergola being built,

17:07.526 --> 17:08.925
they're all gonna want one.

17:09.028 --> 17:11.573
That's what it's like
in Deer Hills.

17:11.597 --> 17:12.730
I hope so.

17:17.269 --> 17:19.337
<i>( crowd cheers )</i>

17:24.376 --> 17:26.887
( laughs )
There's the guy.

17:26.912 --> 17:28.780
- Good job.
- Thanks.

17:28.881 --> 17:31.816
- Great game.
- Thanks, Mom.

17:31.917 --> 17:34.318
- Great game, Sam.
- Thank you, Mr. Parish.

17:34.420 --> 17:36.220
Okay.

17:36.321 --> 17:39.791
Dad, I invited some people over.
That okay?

17:39.892 --> 17:42.437
It's a school night.
I don't think so.

17:42.461 --> 17:45.163
Aw, let him have some fun.
He's earned it.

17:45.264 --> 17:46.297
Homework's done?

17:46.398 --> 17:47.698
Yeah.

17:47.800 --> 17:49.500
You coming, Nat?

17:49.601 --> 17:51.869
Uh, is that okay, Dad?

17:51.970 --> 17:55.239
Sure, if Mr. and Mrs. Cahill
are okay with it,

17:55.340 --> 17:56.541
I guess it's fine.

17:56.642 --> 17:58.443
- You can ride in my car.
- Okay.

17:58.544 --> 18:01.104
Don't worry, Mr. Parish.
I'm a good driver.

18:05.117 --> 18:07.118
( chattering )

18:11.590 --> 18:13.658
I'm gonna pick you up
at 11:00, okay?

18:13.759 --> 18:16.894
♪

19:29.868 --> 19:31.602
Natalie, what are you doing?

19:31.703 --> 19:33.371
I just needed some fresh air.

19:36.575 --> 19:38.876
Natalie, are you drunk?

19:38.977 --> 19:41.646
Natalie, are you drunk?

19:41.747 --> 19:43.814
Okay, come on.

19:43.916 --> 19:46.427
Come on, no,
you're coming with me.

19:46.451 --> 19:49.287
Come on, I gotta
get you in the truck.

19:51.557 --> 19:53.958
- ( retching )
- Okay, okay.

19:54.059 --> 19:56.327
Here look, you're getting
it in your hair.

19:59.565 --> 20:03.901
Are you okay?
Are you done?

20:04.002 --> 20:05.436
Dad, please, get off.

20:05.537 --> 20:08.072
Dad, get off.

20:08.173 --> 20:09.674
I'm trying to get home,
get off me.

20:09.775 --> 20:11.186
- I know we're try...
- Get off...

20:11.210 --> 20:13.578
- Honey? Come here.
- ( grunting )

20:13.679 --> 20:14.545
( shouts )

20:14.646 --> 20:16.581
( groans )

20:27.726 --> 20:30.928
Excuse me, hi.

20:31.029 --> 20:33.264
My daughter's been drinking.

20:33.365 --> 20:34.832
She's getting sick.

20:34.933 --> 20:36.467
She fell and hit her head.

20:36.568 --> 20:38.379
Okay, sir, I just need you
to fill out that form,

20:38.403 --> 20:40.281
<i>and I'm gonna need
your insurance card.</i>

20:40.305 --> 20:43.441
- Okay, can I please just...
- We need a doctor up front.

20:43.542 --> 20:45.610
Natalie, come here, baby.
( grunts )

21:06.231 --> 21:08.266
<i>( beeping )</i>

21:28.820 --> 21:30.388
Marty.

21:32.324 --> 21:34.258
Hey.

21:34.359 --> 21:36.594
Hey, I was just
finishing up my shift

21:36.695 --> 21:39.196
- when I saw Natalie.
- Is she okay?

21:39.298 --> 21:42.400
She's unconscious, but stable.

21:46.972 --> 21:49.607
Alcohol poisoning.

21:49.708 --> 21:52.777
But we'll keep
the oxygen flowing

21:52.878 --> 21:55.112
and flush her system out
with vitamins,

21:55.213 --> 21:57.748
and she'll bounce right back.

21:57.849 --> 22:02.286
Listen, Marty,
does Natalie have a boyfriend?

22:02.387 --> 22:05.089
A boyfriend?
No, why?

22:05.190 --> 22:08.125
Just the admitting nurse,

22:08.226 --> 22:10.061
when she examined her,
found some blood.

22:10.162 --> 22:13.731
- Did somebody hurt her?
- Don't jump to conclusions.

22:13.832 --> 22:16.567
We have a detective
on his way down just in case

22:16.668 --> 22:18.602
any accusations arise,
but at this point,

22:18.704 --> 22:20.338
it's strictly precautionary.

22:20.439 --> 22:23.874
Whatever you need.
When can I see my daughter?

22:25.644 --> 22:29.380
Soon. Soon.

22:29.481 --> 22:33.284
In the meantime,
I am required to give you this.

22:35.687 --> 22:39.357
Just... take it easy.
I'll be back, okay?

22:39.458 --> 22:40.658
Take it easy.

23:06.118 --> 23:08.085
Dad.

23:08.186 --> 23:09.954
Dad?

23:10.055 --> 23:11.055
Hey.

23:13.959 --> 23:15.693
Are you okay?

23:15.794 --> 23:17.328
I'm fine.

23:17.429 --> 23:19.697
You had me so worried.

23:19.798 --> 23:21.078
Martin.

23:23.135 --> 23:26.170
Sorry to interrupt.
I'm Detective Will Schaffer.

23:26.271 --> 23:28.339
Martin Parish.

23:28.440 --> 23:30.674
Natalie, do you mind
if I ask you a few questions?

23:30.776 --> 23:34.879
Yeah, you can ask her
a few questions.

23:34.980 --> 23:38.282
Martin, why don't you come
to my office for a couple
minutes, huh?

23:38.383 --> 23:40.017
<i>Come on.</i>

23:43.555 --> 23:45.389
I'll be right outside, okay?

23:50.896 --> 23:52.740
Will: <i>Mr. Parish,
Natalie's gonna be fine.</i>

23:52.764 --> 23:57.334
Her story is that nobody
did anything wrong.

23:57.436 --> 23:59.703
The body examination
corroborates.

23:59.805 --> 24:01.725
There was no sign of a struggle.

24:01.773 --> 24:04.809
There's no indication that this
was non-consensual sex.

24:04.910 --> 24:06.377
You said there was blood.

24:06.478 --> 24:07.545
<i>There was.</i>

24:10.849 --> 24:12.983
It was her first time, Martin.

24:15.253 --> 24:17.331
<i>Sometimes kids don't
really know their limit,</i>

24:17.355 --> 24:19.100
especially when alcohol's
involved.

24:19.124 --> 24:20.924
- Who did this to her?
- <i>Mr. Parish.</i>

24:20.959 --> 24:22.726
To be clear...

24:22.828 --> 24:25.930
no one <i> did</i> anything
to Natalie, do you understand?

24:30.302 --> 24:32.636
Do you know a boy
named Sam Cahill?

24:35.607 --> 24:36.674
Yeah.

24:38.877 --> 24:41.545
Natalie says that the sex
was consensual.

24:41.646 --> 24:43.814
- Oh, man.
- Here.

24:47.986 --> 24:51.155
If she changes her story,
gimme a call.

24:58.930 --> 25:00.431
Take her home, Marty.

25:11.276 --> 25:13.077
So you know him personally?

25:13.178 --> 25:15.323
Yeah, I treated his wife, Sarah.

25:15.347 --> 25:17.314
Bone cancer.

25:17.415 --> 25:19.884
She died when Natalie
was four years old.

25:22.053 --> 25:23.721
The girl's all he's got.

25:32.597 --> 25:34.909
Um... honey,
can I make you some food?

25:34.933 --> 25:38.035
'Cause you gotta be hungry.
And then we can talk?

25:38.136 --> 25:40.938
I'm just really tired.

25:44.242 --> 25:48.312
Okay, but, I mean...
we can talk, right?

25:50.515 --> 25:53.150
I'm just really tired.

25:53.251 --> 25:54.531
Okay.

26:07.566 --> 26:09.333
Nat.

26:09.434 --> 26:11.212
Oh, my God, are you okay?

26:11.236 --> 26:14.338
- Why, what have you heard?
- What everyone else has,

26:14.439 --> 26:15.983
that you spent the night
in the hospital?

26:16.007 --> 26:17.641
What? How?

26:17.742 --> 26:20.021
They said that the cops
came to Sam's house

26:20.045 --> 26:24.148
and broke up the party,
after you ended up unconscious.

26:24.249 --> 26:26.116
Do you want to talk about it?

26:26.217 --> 26:28.652
- I have nothing to say.
- Natalie.

26:28.753 --> 26:31.755
Careful, guys,
or Ms. Lightweight here

26:31.856 --> 26:33.891
- might vomit on your shoes.
- ( laughter )

26:33.992 --> 26:35.893
Gotta get to class.

26:43.034 --> 26:46.003
Knock yourself out.
She didn't even touch it?

26:46.104 --> 26:47.671
She's okay now?

26:47.772 --> 26:49.517
She seems to be, yeah.

26:49.541 --> 26:53.344
Well... great,
Great, Martin.

26:53.445 --> 26:55.646
I mean, what a relief.

26:55.747 --> 26:58.015
We had a real scare up here

26:58.116 --> 26:59.427
with the cops knocking
down the door

26:59.451 --> 27:01.385
in the middle of the night
and all that.

27:01.486 --> 27:03.120
You have to know I had no idea.

27:03.221 --> 27:05.556
When Sam said he had friends
coming over, I had no idea.

27:05.657 --> 27:09.159
No, of course not, I know,
but still, you could've...

27:09.260 --> 27:12.029
I just feel so bad
about the whole thing.

27:12.130 --> 27:13.631
You let them hang
in the basement.

27:13.732 --> 27:15.532
You trust that they're not
up to no good.

27:15.634 --> 27:18.335
And then the cops show up,
and it's just a whole big mess?

27:18.436 --> 27:21.038
I'm just so glad
that she's okay.

27:24.609 --> 27:27.211
She just wants things
to get back to normal.

27:27.312 --> 27:28.812
Yeah, yeah.
These things happen.

27:28.913 --> 27:31.115
We all just have to move on,
right?

27:32.984 --> 27:35.319
Speaking of which,
I just got off the phone

27:35.420 --> 27:36.987
with James Woodrow.

27:37.088 --> 27:38.799
He doesn't want
to wait any longer.

27:38.823 --> 27:41.383
He asked if you and Nick
can start tomorrow.

27:43.461 --> 27:46.830
That's great,
but we don't even have

27:46.931 --> 27:49.333
- the plans laid out yet.
- It doesn't matter.

27:49.434 --> 27:51.312
You just head on up
and start mapping out

27:51.336 --> 27:53.896
your plans on the clock,
and listen,

27:53.972 --> 27:56.450
if there's anything else
Julie and I can do,

27:56.474 --> 27:57.752
you let us know.

27:57.776 --> 28:01.111
There is actually
just one more thing.

28:01.212 --> 28:03.714
Um...

28:03.815 --> 28:05.883
Maybe Detective Schaffer
told you

28:05.984 --> 28:08.218
that they had to test Natalie
with a, uh...

28:08.319 --> 28:09.853
a rape kit?

28:13.825 --> 28:15.426
Gee, Martin.

28:15.527 --> 28:18.228
No, no,
he failed to mention that.

28:18.329 --> 28:20.641
Probably because it didn't
amount to anything, it's just...

28:20.665 --> 28:22.933
Is Natalie saying that Sam...

28:23.034 --> 28:25.235
No, no, not at all.

28:25.336 --> 28:27.604
It's...
It's just a precaution.

28:27.706 --> 28:30.607
All right.

28:30.709 --> 28:32.443
All right.

28:32.544 --> 28:35.612
Anyway, I just, um...

28:35.714 --> 28:38.348
I thought you should know.

28:38.450 --> 28:39.783
Of course.

29:02.006 --> 29:04.007
Teacher:
<i>Okay, everybody.</i>

29:04.109 --> 29:07.311
<i>Mr. President, why don't
you tell us what you think?</i>

29:07.412 --> 29:09.880
<i>Sam.</i>

29:11.816 --> 29:14.918
Uh, yeah.
Sounds good.

29:20.959 --> 29:24.461
Natalie.
Natalie.

29:24.562 --> 29:26.830
We need to talk.

29:26.931 --> 29:29.032
Please, leave me alone.

29:47.685 --> 29:49.486
So how was school today? Hey.

29:49.587 --> 29:53.290
Did you know that the police
went to the Cahills

29:53.391 --> 29:57.327
after I went to the hospital?

29:57.428 --> 30:00.264
Yeah, yeah, I, uh...

30:00.365 --> 30:02.866
I knew that.

30:02.967 --> 30:06.103
Did you tell them to?

30:06.204 --> 30:08.872
No, I didn't tell them to.

30:08.973 --> 30:11.642
But you told them
where the party was.

30:11.743 --> 30:15.212
Honey, I... I told them
everything that I knew.

30:18.716 --> 30:19.883
What?

30:24.155 --> 30:26.490
Everyone's talking.

30:26.591 --> 30:28.625
They're just concerned.

30:28.726 --> 30:32.029
Why? Why can't everyone
just mind their own business?

30:34.199 --> 30:36.700
<i>- ( door slams ) -</i> ( Sighs )

30:41.606 --> 30:43.640
( whirring )

30:56.154 --> 30:57.487
Hey.

30:59.324 --> 31:02.826
So there's a B-movie marathon
at the Prestige.

31:02.927 --> 31:05.696
Thought maybe we could go,
do our own voiceovers.

31:05.797 --> 31:08.165
I have a lot of homework.

31:08.266 --> 31:10.133
<i>Okay.</i>

31:10.235 --> 31:12.169
<i>Well, maybe some other time.</i>

31:44.802 --> 31:46.336
Okay.

31:51.109 --> 31:53.310
- Ready?
- ( engine turns over )

32:38.957 --> 32:41.468
You should try the chicken.
It's good.

32:41.492 --> 32:43.093
Just not really hungry.

32:48.900 --> 32:50.334
Okay.

32:57.342 --> 32:58.608
Tess!

33:13.458 --> 33:16.660
Don't see you
around much anymore.

33:16.761 --> 33:18.929
Yeah, sorry.

33:23.101 --> 33:24.901
Tess, you know
you can talk to me, right?

33:27.538 --> 33:28.818
I know.

33:31.776 --> 33:35.712
Natalie hasn't really been
acting like herself lately, huh?

33:38.850 --> 33:41.985
Look, I'm just trying
to understand what's going on,

33:42.086 --> 33:43.653
and she's not talking to me.

33:43.755 --> 33:46.256
Has she said anything to you
about that night at all?

33:46.357 --> 33:49.593
She's been pretty much
avoiding me

33:49.694 --> 33:51.661
and everyone else ever since.

33:51.763 --> 33:53.497
What about Sam?

33:56.701 --> 33:58.335
What?

33:58.436 --> 34:00.180
Look, I don't want to get anyone
into any trouble.

34:00.204 --> 34:02.806
You won't get anybody into
any trouble, I promise you.

34:04.342 --> 34:07.177
( sighs )
So the day after the party,

34:07.278 --> 34:10.347
I saw Natalie
and Sam in the hall.

34:10.447 --> 34:14.117
He was chasing after her.
He was trying to talk to her.

34:14.217 --> 34:16.719
He grabbed her.

34:16.821 --> 34:19.222
How did he grab her?

34:19.322 --> 34:21.525
Her arm.

34:21.626 --> 34:23.637
Look, she was trying
to get away from him.

34:23.661 --> 34:26.040
He grabbed her arm,
but then she pulled away

34:26.063 --> 34:27.630
and ran off.

34:27.732 --> 34:29.399
I don't know.

34:29.500 --> 34:31.168
It was probably nothing.

34:33.704 --> 34:35.304
Yeah, probably.

34:43.014 --> 34:45.215
♪

35:21.018 --> 35:22.953
( telephone rings )

35:26.624 --> 35:28.758
Detective Schaffer.

35:28.860 --> 35:32.262
Hi, Detective,
this is Martin Parish.

35:32.363 --> 35:33.864
I'm Natalie's father.

35:33.965 --> 35:35.742
<i>I brought her
into the hospital for...</i>

35:35.766 --> 35:38.135
I remember you, Mr. Parish.
What can I do for you?

35:38.236 --> 35:42.672
Well, you said to give you
a call if anything changed,

35:42.773 --> 35:47.043
and, um... well,
I've been seeing symptoms,

35:47.145 --> 35:50.313
and Sam Cahill,
he grabbed Natalie in school,

35:50.414 --> 35:51.815
and it sounded pretty rough,

35:51.916 --> 35:54.818
and I just thought that
it might be relevant.

35:54.919 --> 35:56.520
Natalie told you this?

35:58.956 --> 36:03.193
No, no, her...
Her best friend, um...

36:03.294 --> 36:06.196
Tess Gerty,
she saw the whole thing.

36:06.297 --> 36:09.866
Okay, well, um...

36:09.967 --> 36:12.802
I'm afraid it's only relevant
if Natalie's changed her story

36:12.904 --> 36:14.604
<i>about what happened that night.</i>

36:16.574 --> 36:18.855
<i>Otherwise it's just it's just
a couple of kids...</i>

36:24.115 --> 36:26.016
No, n... she has.

36:26.117 --> 36:27.450
<i>I'm sorry?</i>

36:27.552 --> 36:29.753
Yeah, Natalie,
she has changed her story.

36:33.491 --> 36:35.992
Uh, okay.

36:36.093 --> 36:39.930
Okay, well, then we're going to
need to get her on the record

36:40.031 --> 36:41.064
giving her side...

36:41.165 --> 36:43.600
Okay, well, see, the thing is,

36:43.701 --> 36:47.837
is that I don't... I don't think
that she's ready for
that quite yet.

36:47.939 --> 36:50.273
She...
It's a bit overwhelming,

36:50.374 --> 36:53.243
and I'm the only person
that she's talking to about it.

36:53.344 --> 36:56.947
Um... so I just
don't want to rush her.

36:58.950 --> 37:01.430
But I also read it's important
to start these investigations

37:01.519 --> 37:03.720
as soon as possible,
so I just thought

37:03.821 --> 37:06.856
that if I called you that
we could start the...

37:06.958 --> 37:08.792
<i>I understand.</i>

37:08.893 --> 37:11.595
Listen, I'll bring Sam Cahill
in tomorrow.

37:11.696 --> 37:13.707
I'll get his side of the story
in full detail.

37:13.731 --> 37:15.899
Once we have that,
then maybe Natalie

37:16.000 --> 37:18.045
will feel a little more
comfortable telling her side.

37:18.069 --> 37:20.203
<i>I'll be in touch.</i>

37:20.304 --> 37:21.671
Okay, thank you.

37:28.012 --> 37:32.649
Tell us in your own words
what happened the night
of the party.

37:32.750 --> 37:36.953
We're saying he's not
here to actually testify.
He's here of his own volition.

37:37.054 --> 37:38.899
I'm just trying
to get to the bottom

37:38.923 --> 37:40.757
of what happened that night.

37:40.858 --> 37:43.460
Now neither you
or I were in that room

37:43.561 --> 37:45.339
to give any sort of response
about what it was.

37:45.363 --> 37:48.465
So I need to hear from Sam
exactly what happened.

38:04.148 --> 38:05.682
Hey, sweetie.

38:05.783 --> 38:08.295
I was going to wake you,
but you looked so peaceful.

38:08.319 --> 38:10.879
Fish won't bite all day, though.

38:10.921 --> 38:12.088
You're going fishing?

38:12.189 --> 38:14.157
Nope,<i> we're</i> going fishing.

38:14.258 --> 38:16.218
- Dad, I don't...
- Lake Hopatcong.

38:16.294 --> 38:17.971
It's where your mom and I used
to go when we were

38:17.995 --> 38:19.940
a little bit overwhelmed
or stressed.

38:19.964 --> 38:22.524
It's a relaxing kind of place,
and you're gonna love it.

38:25.503 --> 38:27.237
So get dressed.

38:29.974 --> 38:31.174
Okay.

38:35.279 --> 38:37.480
( sighs )

38:37.581 --> 38:40.650
- So I have it unlocked.
- Wait, is this locked?

38:41.986 --> 38:43.253
Yeah, you're good.

38:43.354 --> 38:46.022
So I'm gonna cast first.
Ready?

38:46.123 --> 38:47.123
Mm-hmm.

38:50.027 --> 38:51.561
There you go.

38:51.662 --> 38:52.896
Okay, then lock it.

38:52.997 --> 38:54.864
Okay.

38:54.965 --> 38:57.267
Watch the...
There you go.

38:57.368 --> 38:59.402
Nice.

38:59.503 --> 39:02.205
Done, there you go.

39:02.306 --> 39:03.873
- Okay.
- All right.

39:07.645 --> 39:09.879
Now what?

39:09.980 --> 39:11.581
Now we wait.

39:15.686 --> 39:17.487
Kind of boring, isn't it?

39:20.224 --> 39:22.692
If by boring,
you mean relaxing, then, yes.

39:22.793 --> 39:24.728
It is incredibly boring.

39:31.535 --> 39:33.570
How's student council going?

39:33.671 --> 39:34.951
It's fine.

39:37.174 --> 39:39.275
Have you started planning
the Winter Formal yet?

39:39.377 --> 39:41.444
Unfortunately, yes.

39:41.545 --> 39:44.414
Do sophomores
get to go to that dance?

39:44.515 --> 39:46.727
If they're asked
by a junior or a senior.

39:46.751 --> 39:48.418
Ah, that's right.

39:48.519 --> 39:50.353
That's how I first went,
you know.

39:50.454 --> 39:51.898
I thought you and mom met
at graduation

39:51.922 --> 39:55.592
with the famous
flying cap story.

39:55.693 --> 39:57.160
We did.

39:59.597 --> 40:01.231
I went with Julie.

40:04.034 --> 40:05.335
Julie...

40:05.436 --> 40:07.003
Cahill now.

40:07.104 --> 40:09.939
Rogers then.

40:10.040 --> 40:11.808
You never told me
that you dated Mrs. Cahill.

40:11.909 --> 40:14.177
That was a long time ago.

40:14.278 --> 40:16.123
Besides, your mother
was my first real girlfriend.

40:16.147 --> 40:17.514
Julie and I were just...

40:17.615 --> 40:20.316
casual.

40:20.418 --> 40:21.851
Dad, ew.

40:21.952 --> 40:24.521
I'm just saying,
I know how it is at that age.

40:24.622 --> 40:28.658
Sometimes things don't feel
so black and white.

40:28.759 --> 40:31.161
Can get confusing.
There's a lot of peer pressure...

40:31.262 --> 40:33.196
Okay, Dad.

40:33.297 --> 40:35.064
Okay.

40:35.166 --> 40:37.767
I'm just saying, if you want
to talk to me about it.

40:39.670 --> 40:41.281
Whoa, whoa, what do I do?
What do I do?

40:41.305 --> 40:42.785
Okay, all right, all right,
all right.

40:42.840 --> 40:45.041
We got a fish on.
That's good.

40:45.142 --> 40:47.510
So what I want you to do
is we're gonna tire him out.

40:47.611 --> 40:51.648
Okay, this just a matter
of waiting the fish out.
We're gonna exhaust him,

40:51.749 --> 40:53.483
so when I say, go,

40:53.584 --> 40:56.553
I want you to set the hook.
That just means give
a little tug.

40:56.654 --> 41:00.390
Se the hook.
Just pull that. Good.

41:00.491 --> 41:01.991
Now you got him.

41:02.092 --> 41:03.693
- Okay?
- Okay.

41:03.794 --> 41:05.995
Now just, uh...

41:06.096 --> 41:07.808
Come here, buddy.
All right, come here.

41:07.832 --> 41:09.432
I'm gonna reach out.

41:09.533 --> 41:12.035
Oh, look at that.

41:12.136 --> 41:15.338
Huh? So pretty.

41:15.439 --> 41:17.841
Here. Pet him.

41:17.942 --> 41:19.108
Just pet him.

41:19.210 --> 41:20.410
( both laugh )

41:20.511 --> 41:24.013
- Just pet it.
- ( laughs )

41:25.316 --> 41:26.493
What should we name him?

41:26.517 --> 41:28.685
<i>Um, Food.</i>

41:28.786 --> 41:30.954
( chattering )

41:31.055 --> 41:32.355
( reel whirs )

41:32.456 --> 41:33.756
Oh!

41:33.858 --> 41:36.226
( laughs )

41:36.327 --> 41:39.896
We caught a pier.
( laughs )

41:39.997 --> 41:43.166
If we're talking about poundage,
then this guy won.

41:43.267 --> 41:47.537
But it's all about the catch,
and I caught more.

41:47.638 --> 41:49.906
Well...

41:50.007 --> 41:52.141
I can't argue with that.

41:54.578 --> 41:56.312
What's the matter?

41:56.413 --> 41:59.883
I think I just...
spent too much time in the sun.

41:59.984 --> 42:03.286
Okay, why don't you
just go take a shower,

42:03.387 --> 42:04.754
and I'll prep the feast?

42:04.855 --> 42:06.689
Okay, don't do too much
without me, though.

42:06.790 --> 42:08.391
I want to learn
the whole process.

42:11.495 --> 42:12.829
You got it.

42:17.868 --> 42:20.236
<i>( beeps ) Martin,
this is Detective Schaffer.</i>

42:20.337 --> 42:23.072
<i>Look, I spoke
with Sam Cahill today.</i>

42:23.173 --> 42:25.942
<i>His story is that Natalie
asked to go up to his room</i>

42:26.043 --> 42:29.445
<i>and it was consensual
the whole way through.</i>

42:29.547 --> 42:33.316
<i>So if Natalie has a different
story like you said,</i>

42:33.417 --> 42:36.419
<i>I'm really going to need
to hear it myself.</i>

42:36.520 --> 42:38.398
<i>Otherwise there's nothing else
I can do.</i>

42:38.422 --> 42:40.142
- <i>( beeps )</i>
- What'd you do?

42:48.432 --> 42:50.266
Natalie,
you're not talking to me,

42:50.367 --> 42:51.367
and I just figured I'd...

42:51.435 --> 42:53.169
So you lied to the police?

42:53.270 --> 42:56.005
No, I... look...

42:56.106 --> 42:58.346
I just feel like you're maybe
a little confused.

42:58.409 --> 42:59.876
I am not confused.

42:59.977 --> 43:01.811
You are, you... okay,

43:01.912 --> 43:03.957
You're not acting like yourself.
You're moping around.

43:03.981 --> 43:05.882
You're acting down.
You're not...

43:05.983 --> 43:08.785
That's because you couldn't
take care of me that night

43:08.886 --> 43:12.055
without getting
the whole world involved.

43:12.156 --> 43:14.724
Now I'm the girl
who partied too hard,

43:14.825 --> 43:17.345
who went to the hospital
then broke up the party...

43:17.394 --> 43:19.395
Let me ask you a question.
No, no, no, listen.

43:19.496 --> 43:21.364
How do you think it feels
to be driving down

43:21.465 --> 43:23.633
the middle of the road
and see your daughter

43:23.734 --> 43:26.369
swaying all over the place
and then slurring her words?

43:26.470 --> 43:29.539
- You're vomiting...
- I was drunk, Dad!

43:29.640 --> 43:31.785
- That's what happens!
- Not to people like you!

43:31.809 --> 43:34.744
I acted my age for once
in my life,

43:34.845 --> 43:36.823
and I end up with you,
the police,

43:36.847 --> 43:40.383
doctors interrogating me while
my head is still spinning!

43:40.484 --> 43:42.185
Here's what I'm asking you,
okay?

43:42.286 --> 43:44.297
If you're ready to talk
about it, I'm ready to listen.

43:44.321 --> 43:46.723
- You're not listening to me!
- I <i> am</i> listening to you!

43:46.824 --> 43:50.026
You're not listening to me!

43:50.127 --> 43:52.829
I had sex with Sam Cahill!

43:52.930 --> 43:55.498
Okay.

43:55.599 --> 43:58.668
He didn't force me to drink.

43:58.769 --> 44:01.329
He didn't force me
to do anything.

44:02.973 --> 44:06.643
I asked him to take me upstairs.

44:06.744 --> 44:09.679
I had sex with him
because I wanted to.

44:12.383 --> 44:15.184
And, yeah.

44:15.285 --> 44:17.520
I've been down.

44:17.621 --> 44:20.023
Because losing your virginity

44:20.124 --> 44:22.792
is supposed to be
a special memory,

44:22.893 --> 44:26.529
not some big public circus

44:26.630 --> 44:29.365
that you are only making worse!

44:31.869 --> 44:33.236
Baby, I'm trying to fix.

44:33.337 --> 44:36.372
No. No! No!

44:36.473 --> 44:38.341
Don't "baby" me.

44:38.442 --> 44:43.179
I am not your baby girl anymore,
so stop treating me like one.

44:48.786 --> 44:50.186
Okay.

45:00.130 --> 45:01.431
I'm sorry.

45:05.402 --> 45:07.722
I'm sorry if it's hard
for you to hear.

45:09.273 --> 45:12.175
I really am.
But maybe if mom was here...

45:12.276 --> 45:13.776
No, no, no, no.

45:13.877 --> 45:16.612
No, you don't...
You don't get to say that, okay?

45:16.714 --> 45:18.581
You didn't even know
your mother.

45:18.682 --> 45:21.317
You need to stop putting her
on a pedestal.

45:21.418 --> 45:23.553
Because she
wouldn't do anything.

45:23.654 --> 45:26.923
Do you understand?
You can stop that right now.

45:40.571 --> 45:42.271
<i>( cell phone ringing )</i>

45:48.979 --> 45:50.313
Hello.

45:50.414 --> 45:53.382
Uh... hi.
Julie?

45:55.953 --> 45:57.320
Martin?

45:57.421 --> 45:58.721
<i>Yeah.</i>

45:58.822 --> 46:01.157
Look, I'm sorry
to call you this late.

46:01.258 --> 46:03.059
I was just...

46:03.160 --> 46:05.520
I was hoping that maybe we could
get together and talk?

46:05.596 --> 46:09.465
Martin, I don't think
that's a really good idea.

46:09.566 --> 46:11.686
Bruce had to take Sam
down to the station.

46:11.735 --> 46:13.269
<i>I know, I just, um...</i>

46:15.339 --> 46:18.040
I don't have anybody
to talk to right now.

46:18.142 --> 46:22.278
And I, um...
I just need somebody to talk to.

46:24.414 --> 46:25.715
Please.

46:27.518 --> 46:28.918
Okay.

46:29.019 --> 46:31.888
I guess I can get away
for an hour or so.

46:31.989 --> 46:33.756
Where should we meet?

46:33.857 --> 46:35.324
<i>( engine turns over )</i>

46:37.161 --> 46:39.095
<i>( vehicle departs )</i>

47:00.851 --> 47:03.186
<i>( ringing )</i>

47:05.956 --> 47:07.223
Hi, Tess.

47:07.324 --> 47:10.726
<i>Natalie, what's up?</i>

47:10.828 --> 47:13.095
I'm sorry that I've
been acting so weird.

47:13.197 --> 47:16.232
I just don't have anyone else
that I can talk to now.

47:16.333 --> 47:18.134
And...

47:18.235 --> 47:21.103
I'm really scared.
I need your help.

47:21.205 --> 47:22.872
<i>Okay, what do you need?</i>

47:44.895 --> 47:46.739
You had a nicer car
in high school.

47:46.763 --> 47:48.130
( laughs )

47:56.473 --> 47:59.308
I was worried we were gonna run
into some kids out here.

47:59.409 --> 48:02.278
I don't think these kids use it
the same way we used to.

48:02.379 --> 48:04.380
( chuckles )

48:04.481 --> 48:07.950
Not when they have
a basement and a comfy couch.

48:08.051 --> 48:09.752
Martin...

48:09.853 --> 48:11.087
I'm sorry...

48:11.188 --> 48:13.166
No, I'm sorry, it was my house.

48:13.190 --> 48:15.258
Julie, I didn't ask you here
to talk about that.

48:15.359 --> 48:16.792
I... I promise.

48:18.528 --> 48:22.598
So... is everything okay?

48:22.699 --> 48:24.667
Is Natalie okay?

48:24.768 --> 48:28.738
Yeah, yeah, Natalie's...

48:28.839 --> 48:31.240
No.

48:31.341 --> 48:32.875
Everything's not okay.

48:40.117 --> 48:44.120
When Natalie
just started walking...

48:44.221 --> 48:45.381
Sarah decided that she wanted

48:45.455 --> 48:49.358
to do something... different.

48:49.459 --> 48:51.894
She said that being a mom
was harder than she thought.

48:51.995 --> 48:54.730
So she just wanted
to try something new.

48:57.634 --> 49:00.536
So she started taking these
pottery classes up in Walden

49:00.637 --> 49:03.773
every Thursday
from 5:00 to 6:00.

49:03.874 --> 49:06.208
And every few weeks
she'd bring home a new vase

49:06.310 --> 49:10.046
or a bowl or something, and...

49:10.147 --> 49:12.648
I'd say, "Wow, honey, this looks
really great," you know?

49:12.749 --> 49:14.183
"You're doing so good.

49:14.284 --> 49:16.118
We should look into getting
a kiln

49:16.219 --> 49:18.654
put in the house for you,"
you know?

49:18.755 --> 49:21.457
I just wanted her
to feel good about something.

49:21.558 --> 49:26.028
I wanted to feel proud
about something.

49:26.129 --> 49:29.131
So this one week, she came home

49:29.232 --> 49:32.401
with this really
pretty yellow vase.

49:32.502 --> 49:35.638
And she said she thought
it would look beautiful

49:35.739 --> 49:37.506
in the window
with some sunflowers in it.

49:37.607 --> 49:39.208
So the next morning, I did that.

49:39.309 --> 49:42.078
I went and got some sunflowers,
and I put them in the vase,

49:42.179 --> 49:43.813
and I put it on the window.

49:43.914 --> 49:45.181
And she was right.

49:45.282 --> 49:48.584
I mean, it looked beautiful.

49:50.520 --> 49:52.054
( chuckles )

49:52.155 --> 49:54.156
Later that day when Natalie
got home from school,

49:54.257 --> 49:55.802
she had a friend over
and they were rough-housing,

49:55.826 --> 49:58.060
and they knocked the vase,
and it fell off the window

49:58.161 --> 50:01.497
and it hit the kitchen floor
and shattered into 1,000 pieces.

50:01.565 --> 50:04.266
So... I was mad.

50:06.803 --> 50:10.773
Kept thinking,
"What am I going to tell Sarah?"

50:10.874 --> 50:12.508
She's going to be so upset.

50:12.609 --> 50:14.143
She worked so hard
on this thing.

50:17.114 --> 50:20.549
Started cleaning it up,
and when I was done.

50:20.650 --> 50:23.786
I saw this
one little shard left.

50:23.887 --> 50:25.755
I picked it up,
and I turn it over,

50:25.856 --> 50:27.690
and it had this sticker on it.

50:27.791 --> 50:31.560
The sticker said "$9.99."

50:31.661 --> 50:34.096
( sighs )

50:36.466 --> 50:40.002
At least she got
a good deal on it.

50:40.103 --> 50:41.837
It was a really pretty vase.

50:46.343 --> 50:49.278
You know that place
the Pink Motel up on Route 14?

50:49.379 --> 50:53.516
Real flashy one with the,
yeah, the big neon sign?

50:56.053 --> 50:58.454
When I first saw the guy...

51:01.291 --> 51:03.359
I was actually disappointed.

51:06.430 --> 51:08.664
I guess I just expected him
to be this young,

51:08.765 --> 51:10.566
slick kid, you know, but...

51:13.270 --> 51:17.673
Maybe I thought it'd help
make sense of everything?

51:17.774 --> 51:19.275
But he was just this guy.

51:19.376 --> 51:23.145
He was like this...
normal guy,

51:23.246 --> 51:24.814
this average guy.

51:26.883 --> 51:28.751
Did you confront Sarah?

51:30.787 --> 51:34.657
Yeah, she said
that he made her happy.

51:34.758 --> 51:36.702
And that she was ready
to run off with him.

51:36.726 --> 51:37.993
But then, uh...

51:39.763 --> 51:41.497
She got sick.

51:43.366 --> 51:45.745
Does Natalie know
about any of this?

51:45.769 --> 51:48.437
No. I, uh...
I figured it was hard enough

51:48.538 --> 51:50.272
being raised without a mother,

51:50.373 --> 51:54.510
so I didn't wanna give her
any... bad memories, but...

51:58.048 --> 51:59.281
The point is...

52:01.251 --> 52:05.921
I wasn't enough for Sarah.

52:06.022 --> 52:07.356
She needed more.

52:10.927 --> 52:12.728
And what if Natalie
needs her mother now

52:12.829 --> 52:14.230
and there's nothing I can do?

52:14.331 --> 52:17.967
I mean, what if I can't do
anything about it?

52:18.068 --> 52:19.869
What if I'm not enough?

52:23.740 --> 52:27.143
You're the strongest man
I've ever known.

52:27.244 --> 52:29.178
The strongest.

52:29.246 --> 52:31.806
And you have all this love
that you share.

52:35.785 --> 52:38.921
I just want to take care of her,
you know?

52:39.022 --> 52:40.990
It's all I've ever known
how to do.

52:41.091 --> 52:44.193
And if I can't do that, then...

52:44.294 --> 52:45.995
I mean, who am I?

52:51.635 --> 52:53.335
Natalie's gonna be okay.

53:29.372 --> 53:31.173
Are you gonna tell your dad?

53:35.478 --> 53:38.380
No.

53:38.481 --> 53:40.082
He's been acting
like a crazy person.

53:40.183 --> 53:41.517
I can't talk to him.

53:44.321 --> 53:46.355
I gotta do this by myself.

53:48.825 --> 53:51.393
What about Sam?

53:51.494 --> 53:53.562
I don't even know
if he likes me.

53:56.333 --> 53:57.643
Especially
with how I've been acting

53:57.667 --> 53:59.835
with everything
going on right now.

54:03.873 --> 54:06.433
Don't you think you ought
to figure that out first?

54:07.644 --> 54:09.511
Go talk to him, Natalie.

54:20.357 --> 54:22.735
And...
if you don't think

54:22.759 --> 54:25.319
it'll work out
between you two...

54:26.696 --> 54:28.430
there is another option.

54:32.235 --> 54:34.637
Natalie?

54:34.738 --> 54:36.015
Where you going?

54:36.039 --> 54:37.606
<i>I'm getting a ride to school.</i>

54:37.707 --> 54:39.441
What?! Wh...

55:14.311 --> 55:16.489
So you're finally ready to talk?

55:16.513 --> 55:18.514
Yeah.

55:18.615 --> 55:20.916
Look, I'm sorry
that I've been avoiding you.

55:21.017 --> 55:23.385
I was... I was just
really embarrassed

55:23.486 --> 55:25.954
about breaking up the party
and I kind of figured

55:26.056 --> 55:27.856
that you were mad at me anyway.

55:27.957 --> 55:30.926
No, I don't care
about the party.

55:31.027 --> 55:33.929
I spent all of yesterday
at the police station

55:34.030 --> 55:35.464
being questioned for rape.

55:37.334 --> 55:39.178
- What did you tell them?
- I didn't tell them anything.

55:39.202 --> 55:41.437
- You should.
- What do you want me to say?

55:41.538 --> 55:43.272
The truth?

55:43.373 --> 55:46.175
I mean, we were both
really tanked, right?

55:48.478 --> 55:51.146
Right.

55:51.247 --> 55:54.083
Look, I'm not like you.

55:54.184 --> 55:57.286
I'm not going to get
into college on my grades.

55:57.387 --> 55:59.131
I need this hockey scholarship.

55:59.155 --> 56:01.715
If the coach at Boulder hears
even one word about it...

56:03.727 --> 56:06.095
it's gone.

56:06.196 --> 56:09.431
Look...

56:09.532 --> 56:13.402
we will make sure
that everyone knows

56:13.503 --> 56:16.538
this isn't true, okay?

56:37.627 --> 56:39.495
What's going on
with you this morning?

56:39.596 --> 56:40.876
Nothing.

56:44.701 --> 56:46.702
What the hell is that?

56:48.838 --> 56:51.840
- You don't think, uh...
- Yeah, I don't know.

56:57.614 --> 56:59.848
I left you a message
this morning.

56:59.949 --> 57:01.861
Well, we didn't get your message

57:01.885 --> 57:03.863
because we were driving here
to work.

57:03.887 --> 57:05.364
So would you please just tell us

57:05.388 --> 57:06.955
what's going on right now?

57:07.056 --> 57:08.601
I've decided to take the project

57:08.625 --> 57:10.192
in a different direction.

57:10.293 --> 57:13.462
You decided to change the plans
that you approved of,

57:13.563 --> 57:15.631
that we started working on

57:15.732 --> 57:18.013
because you weren't happy
with what we were doing?

57:18.067 --> 57:20.335
- Is that it?
- Martin. Martin.

57:20.437 --> 57:22.571
We've got the contract.
We'll lose him.

57:22.672 --> 57:24.039
We'll sue these guys.

57:24.140 --> 57:26.375
I wouldn't recommend that.

57:26.476 --> 57:28.154
That's right,
you wouldn't advise it

57:28.178 --> 57:30.122
because you have such great
representation,

57:30.146 --> 57:31.624
- isn't that right?
- It's not worth it.

57:31.648 --> 57:34.216
Come on, come on.

57:34.317 --> 57:36.717
Hey, good luck working
for this pig.

57:51.334 --> 57:53.335
Holy smokes.

57:53.436 --> 57:55.181
For a moment there,
I thought you were actually

57:55.205 --> 57:56.472
gonna take him out.

57:58.374 --> 57:59.808
<i>( engine turns over )</i>

58:02.345 --> 58:03.445
<i>( engine stops )</i>

58:05.482 --> 58:07.683
Did you know?

58:07.784 --> 58:10.385
What, we were gonna
get fired today?

58:10.487 --> 58:12.421
- How could I possibly...
- About Sarah.

58:14.924 --> 58:16.892
- What about her?
- She was your sister.

58:16.993 --> 58:18.504
She must have told
you something.

58:18.528 --> 58:21.088
She must have confided in you.
Did she...

58:21.130 --> 58:23.690
Did she tell you anything?
Did you know?

58:25.301 --> 58:27.069
What are you talking about?

58:32.375 --> 58:34.119
Nothing.
I'm gonna drive you home.

58:34.143 --> 58:35.677
<i>( engine turns over )</i>

58:38.381 --> 58:41.049
Sam: <i>Yeah, the problem
with that is Coach Cran</i>

58:41.150 --> 58:42.761
needs the gymnasium every day

58:42.785 --> 58:45.521
from 3:00 to 6:00 PM
for basketball practice.

58:45.622 --> 58:47.289
So...

58:47.390 --> 58:51.193
<i>I guess we'll look
into other venue options.</i>

58:51.294 --> 58:53.254
That's a good meeting
today, guys.

59:14.851 --> 59:15.851
Natalie, they'll talk.

59:15.919 --> 59:17.819
Yeah.

59:17.921 --> 59:20.366
They'll talk about how Natalie
and Sam are all over each other.

59:20.390 --> 59:22.057
That's the idea.

59:22.158 --> 59:25.627
I mean, we need to show them
that nothing's wrong, right?

59:27.263 --> 59:30.365
So...
I'm your girlfriend now.

59:30.466 --> 59:31.746
Okay?

59:34.203 --> 59:36.605
My dad would kill me if he knew
I was even talking to you.

59:36.706 --> 59:40.609
This isn't about them.
It's about us.

59:40.710 --> 59:45.113
I really need you to be with me
on this one.

59:45.214 --> 59:46.494
Okay, Sam?

59:50.186 --> 59:51.753
Are you with me?

01:00:04.934 --> 01:00:08.870
( laughs ) Uh-oh.

01:00:08.972 --> 01:00:12.841
Looks like the student council's
here to bust us.

01:00:12.942 --> 01:00:15.220
No one cares about you, Kalie.

01:00:15.244 --> 01:00:17.764
Didn't you figure that out when
the president dumped your ass?

01:00:19.382 --> 01:00:22.851
I heard you spent a night
in the hospital, Parish.

01:00:22.952 --> 01:00:24.519
Yeah?

01:00:24.621 --> 01:00:26.588
What was that like?

01:00:26.689 --> 01:00:29.291
The food sucked.

01:00:39.802 --> 01:00:42.137
<i>( telephone rings )</i>

01:00:45.541 --> 01:00:47.142
Mr. Cahill will see you now.

01:01:05.795 --> 01:01:09.464
Martin, what's on your mind?

01:01:11.701 --> 01:01:13.802
James Woodrow fired me today.

01:01:15.805 --> 01:01:18.106
I'm sorry to hear that.

01:01:21.144 --> 01:01:24.846
I don't believe that's the first
time that you're hearing of it.

01:01:24.947 --> 01:01:28.383
What are you insinuating?

01:01:28.484 --> 01:01:30.018
I think you're punishing me.

01:01:30.119 --> 01:01:32.254
I'm the one
who got you that job.

01:01:32.355 --> 01:01:36.224
Which means it would be just
as easy to take it from me.

01:01:36.325 --> 01:01:38.427
Bruce, I understand
you might be upset with me...

01:01:38.528 --> 01:01:42.898
I-I might be upset
about what?

01:01:42.999 --> 01:01:46.368
I had my concerns
about Natalie and Sam.

01:01:46.469 --> 01:01:48.970
I... I called the police.

01:01:49.072 --> 01:01:51.573
<i>I just wanted them
to look into it, that's all.</i>

01:01:51.674 --> 01:01:53.408
And so you think this is what?

01:01:53.509 --> 01:01:57.045
You accuse my son of rape,
and then I take away your job?

01:01:57.146 --> 01:02:00.082
Bruce, I need the money.

01:02:00.183 --> 01:02:01.616
I need it.

01:02:01.718 --> 01:02:03.719
I'm sure.

01:02:03.820 --> 01:02:05.954
You'll find other work.

01:02:06.055 --> 01:02:08.890
But it seems like you're
no longer welcome in Deer Hills.

01:02:20.536 --> 01:02:22.804
Can I just ask you
one more question?

01:02:27.577 --> 01:02:29.511
Did you buy them the liquor?

01:02:29.612 --> 01:02:31.847
Or are you just such
a generous parent

01:02:31.948 --> 01:02:35.817
that you let them have some
out of your own personal stash?

01:02:35.918 --> 01:02:37.252
We're back to this again?

01:02:37.353 --> 01:02:38.864
Your daughter
can't hold her alcohol,

01:02:38.888 --> 01:02:40.532
and that makes me a bad guy
because I'm not

01:02:40.556 --> 01:02:42.824
overbearing like you,
because I don't keep tabs

01:02:42.925 --> 01:02:44.570
on my kid's every single move?

01:02:44.594 --> 01:02:46.661
Maybe if you did,
then my daughter...

01:02:46.763 --> 01:02:49.698
Your daughter what?
Natalie is fine! She's fine!

01:02:49.799 --> 01:02:51.266
<i>You're the one losing it!</i>

01:02:53.569 --> 01:02:55.280
You want to know why
you lost your job?

01:02:55.304 --> 01:02:57.382
Woodrow says that ever
since your daughter got sick,

01:02:57.406 --> 01:02:59.351
you've been screwing up,
making mistakes,

01:02:59.375 --> 01:03:01.176
<i>working half-pace.</i>

01:03:01.277 --> 01:03:02.944
( laughs )

01:03:03.045 --> 01:03:05.480
He says your half-wit
brother-in-law

01:03:05.581 --> 01:03:07.626
is the only one holding
the thing together.

01:03:07.650 --> 01:03:09.551
And still I stood up for you.

01:03:09.652 --> 01:03:11.386
Until yesterday.

01:03:11.487 --> 01:03:13.567
<i>I'm sorry
if I was no longer so forgiving</i>

01:03:13.656 --> 01:03:15.701
after I spent an entire day
listening to my son

01:03:15.725 --> 01:03:17.859
defend himself to the police.

01:03:17.960 --> 01:03:21.530
Yeah, I'm sure you were plenty
helpful in his defense...

01:03:21.631 --> 01:03:23.008
Don't you point
your fingers at me

01:03:23.032 --> 01:03:24.952
because your daughter's a slut!

01:04:10.246 --> 01:04:12.547
Hey! Hey!

01:04:16.252 --> 01:04:17.529
You stay away from her,
you hear me?!

01:04:17.553 --> 01:04:18.833
What are you doing?

01:04:18.921 --> 01:04:20.689
- Natalie, get in the truck.
- No.

01:04:20.790 --> 01:04:21.957
Get in the truck!

01:04:22.058 --> 01:04:23.925
<i>Go!</i>

01:04:29.232 --> 01:04:31.766
<i>I just don't want you
hanging out with Sam Cahill!</i>

01:04:31.868 --> 01:04:34.246
- Why?
- Because he's no good,
just like his father.

01:04:34.270 --> 01:04:36.181
- You don't even know him.
- I know enough.

01:04:36.205 --> 01:04:38.607
- You don't know anything!
- What did you just say?

01:04:38.708 --> 01:04:41.009
I said you don't know anything!

01:04:41.110 --> 01:04:43.812
And you are a horrible father!
I wish that you would die!

01:04:43.913 --> 01:04:45.858
I wish you died,
and I still had my mom!

01:04:45.882 --> 01:04:48.042
- You never had a mom!
- What is that supposed to mean?

01:04:48.084 --> 01:04:50.552
It means your mom was
at the Pink Motel

01:04:50.653 --> 01:04:52.787
busy with her boyfriend!

01:04:52.889 --> 01:04:55.023
So busy she couldn't
raise her own daughter!

01:05:00.296 --> 01:05:01.596
What?

01:05:07.770 --> 01:05:09.571
She was going to leave us,
Natalie.

01:05:13.276 --> 01:05:15.477
Why wouldn't you tell me?

01:05:15.578 --> 01:05:18.380
Natalie, you didn't need to know
about all that stuff, okay?

01:05:18.481 --> 01:05:20.815
I wanted you to feel loved,
like you had a good mother.

01:05:20.917 --> 01:05:23.262
Well, I needed a father,
and you lied.

01:05:23.286 --> 01:05:26.221
I didn't... I was...
Look, I was just scared, okay?

01:05:26.322 --> 01:05:28.556
<i>- Of what?</i>
- Of <i> what?!</i>

01:05:28.658 --> 01:05:31.993
What? Say it.

01:05:32.094 --> 01:05:34.306
Say it!
Say it, Dad.

01:05:34.330 --> 01:05:35.497
Say what?

01:05:35.598 --> 01:05:37.309
You were scared
that if I found out,

01:05:37.333 --> 01:05:38.911
I would turn out just like her.

01:05:38.935 --> 01:05:41.770
Don't you say that!
That's not true!

01:05:41.871 --> 01:05:43.505
Guess what, Daddy.

01:05:43.606 --> 01:05:46.508
Your whore daughter already
got herself knocked up!

01:05:46.609 --> 01:05:49.344
( panting )

01:05:51.514 --> 01:05:53.081
What?

01:05:56.619 --> 01:05:57.652
Okay.

01:06:01.057 --> 01:06:02.924
Why didn't you say something?

01:06:03.025 --> 01:06:04.926
- Why didn't you...
- Tell you?

01:06:05.027 --> 01:06:07.662
Yeah, why didn't you tell me?

01:06:07.763 --> 01:06:11.333
That is a great question
coming from you right now.

01:06:16.038 --> 01:06:17.638
All right, here's what
we're going to do.

01:06:22.378 --> 01:06:23.989
We're going to talk about this.
We're going to figure this out...

01:06:24.013 --> 01:06:26.191
I think that you have
made it very clear

01:06:26.215 --> 01:06:29.250
that we have needed
to talk about a lot of things

01:06:29.352 --> 01:06:32.120
for a long time.

01:06:32.221 --> 01:06:34.389
But it is too late.

01:07:20.036 --> 01:07:23.038
Hi, Sam. Um...

01:07:23.139 --> 01:07:25.140
I think I need a place to stay.

01:07:25.241 --> 01:07:29.611
<i>Um... Yeah, sure.</i>

01:07:29.712 --> 01:07:31.112
( winces )

01:07:59.442 --> 01:08:01.709
I'm sorry that my dad
attacked you.

01:08:04.480 --> 01:08:05.760
It's okay.

01:08:08.417 --> 01:08:10.819
Are you?

01:08:10.920 --> 01:08:12.480
- Hmm?
- Okay?

01:08:14.723 --> 01:08:16.624
I need to ask you something.

01:08:22.264 --> 01:08:23.665
Do you regret it?

01:08:29.004 --> 01:08:30.371
No.

01:08:33.109 --> 01:08:36.511
I mean, I wish it had worked out
differently afterwards.

01:08:38.447 --> 01:08:41.006
But I really like you, Natalie.

01:08:44.653 --> 01:08:47.421
I need to...

01:08:47.523 --> 01:08:49.256
I need to tell you something.

01:08:52.862 --> 01:08:54.362
I'm pregnant.

01:09:02.037 --> 01:09:03.971
Sam:
<i>What do we do?</i>

01:09:07.475 --> 01:09:08.843
I don't know.

01:09:16.719 --> 01:09:18.319
Thank you.

01:09:18.420 --> 01:09:21.356
For what?

01:09:21.457 --> 01:09:23.323
Saying "we."

01:09:33.935 --> 01:09:35.502
Hey, sweetie.

01:09:37.740 --> 01:09:39.240
What's up?

01:09:39.341 --> 01:09:42.777
Natalie Parish is here.

01:09:42.877 --> 01:09:46.390
No, so she can't
be here, Julie.
She needs to leave.

01:09:46.415 --> 01:09:49.082
Bruce... she's pregnant.

01:09:49.185 --> 01:09:51.819
( exclaims )

01:09:51.921 --> 01:09:54.923
<i>These kids,
they're both so confused.</i>

01:09:55.024 --> 01:09:56.758
They need help.

01:09:56.859 --> 01:09:58.670
We should call Martin
so that we can all sit down

01:09:58.694 --> 01:09:59.994
and discuss this.

01:10:00.095 --> 01:10:02.174
No, we let them cool
off for a minute.

01:10:02.198 --> 01:10:10.198
I'll handle Martin.
First, I want to talk to my son.

01:10:18.347 --> 01:10:19.881
Sammy.

01:10:21.050 --> 01:10:22.217
Have a seat.

01:10:29.925 --> 01:10:32.860
So Natalie's
spending the night, huh?

01:10:32.962 --> 01:10:34.562
Yeah.

01:10:34.663 --> 01:10:37.008
I know you don't want me
talking to her dad.

01:10:37.032 --> 01:10:39.734
It's just... complicated.

01:10:39.835 --> 01:10:41.936
Because she's pregnant.

01:10:44.440 --> 01:10:46.474
Your mom overheard.

01:10:52.781 --> 01:10:54.349
You're a good guy.

01:10:54.450 --> 01:10:56.184
You care about this girl?

01:10:59.121 --> 01:11:00.355
Yeah.

01:11:00.456 --> 01:11:01.723
Good.

01:11:03.726 --> 01:11:06.461
Because you and Natalie both
have bright futures ahead of you

01:11:06.562 --> 01:11:08.296
if you make
the right decision now,

01:11:08.397 --> 01:11:11.966
if you nip this thing in the bud
before it's too late.

01:11:12.067 --> 01:11:13.801
What do you mean?

01:11:13.902 --> 01:11:15.814
Well, there's a clinic
in Milltown.

01:11:15.838 --> 01:11:17.716
You're going to take Natalie
first thing in the morning,

01:11:17.740 --> 01:11:19.407
and they'll take care of it.

01:11:19.508 --> 01:11:20.908
It's early enough.

01:11:21.010 --> 01:11:24.112
Quick and easy,
like it never even happened.

01:11:24.213 --> 01:11:27.548
Dad... I don't know
if that's what she wants.

01:11:27.650 --> 01:11:28.983
<i>Sam!</i>

01:11:29.084 --> 01:11:31.164
<i>That girl doesn't know
what she wants.</i>

01:11:31.253 --> 01:11:33.821
It's up to you to convince her
to do what's right.

01:11:33.922 --> 01:11:35.790
What about Mr. Parish?

01:11:35.891 --> 01:11:38.393
Doesn't he have to give
permission or something?

01:11:38.494 --> 01:11:40.238
<i>Legally, he's gotta be notified.</i>

01:11:40.262 --> 01:11:42.230
But there's something called
a judicial bypass.

01:11:42.331 --> 01:11:43.965
You don't have
to worry about that.

01:11:44.066 --> 01:11:45.500
I'll take care of that.

01:11:48.871 --> 01:11:50.471
Do you understand?

01:12:12.728 --> 01:12:15.040
Natalie, I know that you're
really angry with me right now,

01:12:15.064 --> 01:12:18.099
but if you would please just...
let me in,

01:12:18.200 --> 01:12:20.280
I know we can get
through this together.

01:12:22.938 --> 01:12:24.372
Natalie, please?

01:12:28.711 --> 01:12:30.044
Natalie?

01:12:45.027 --> 01:12:47.528
- Come on!
- <i>( engine turns over )</i>

01:12:49.465 --> 01:12:51.265
<i>( tires squeal )</i>

01:13:37.112 --> 01:13:39.881
Natalie!

01:13:39.982 --> 01:13:41.015
Natalie!

01:13:45.454 --> 01:13:47.789
Martin, are you out
of your mind?

01:13:47.890 --> 01:13:49.957
- Where is she?!
- Get off my property.

01:13:50.058 --> 01:13:52.360
- Bruce!
- Go back inside.

01:13:52.461 --> 01:13:55.096
You didn't tell him?
You said you talked it over.

01:13:55.197 --> 01:13:57.565
Talked what over?
Bruce, what did you do?

01:13:57.666 --> 01:13:59.600
I gave our kids a solution.

01:14:01.904 --> 01:14:03.648
Julie, please.
Where are they?

01:14:03.672 --> 01:14:05.473
Julie, don't!

01:14:07.109 --> 01:14:09.343
The clinic in Milltown.

01:14:13.615 --> 01:14:14.982
Marty...

01:14:26.595 --> 01:14:28.930
<i>There's no operation involved.</i>

01:14:29.031 --> 01:14:30.708
<i>What I am gonna do
is prescribe you</i>

01:14:30.732 --> 01:14:32.700
<i>two oral medications.</i>

01:14:32.801 --> 01:14:34.712
The first is called
mifepristone.

01:14:34.736 --> 01:14:36.804
<i>That one you take immediately.</i>

01:14:36.905 --> 01:14:39.507
And what that does is break down
the walls of your uterus

01:14:39.608 --> 01:14:42.477
so that the pregnancy
can't effectively continue.

01:14:42.578 --> 01:14:45.713
<i>After that, you're gonna take
something called misoprostol.</i>

01:14:45.814 --> 01:14:48.516
<i>Now, that one's gonna cause
some pain and some bleeding,</i>

01:14:48.617 --> 01:14:50.518
<i>but that's totally normal.</i>

01:15:12.374 --> 01:15:14.542
( crying )

01:15:20.883 --> 01:15:24.252
<i>( engine turns over )</i>

01:15:29.758 --> 01:15:31.659
I'm looking for my daughter.

01:15:31.760 --> 01:15:33.594
Mr. Parish?

01:15:33.695 --> 01:15:36.664
Sam, where is she?

01:15:36.765 --> 01:15:39.767
Natalie Parish?
She left about 20 minutes ago.

01:15:51.179 --> 01:15:52.446
She took my car.

01:15:58.253 --> 01:16:02.590
Is there anywhere
that she would've gone
that you can think of?

01:16:02.691 --> 01:16:04.025
No.

01:16:07.296 --> 01:16:09.764
Call your mother, Sam.

01:16:09.865 --> 01:16:11.576
No.
I'm coming with you.

01:16:11.600 --> 01:16:13.560
<i>- ( door slams )
- No, you're not.</i>

01:16:36.024 --> 01:16:38.292
Natalie!

01:16:38.393 --> 01:16:40.061
Nat!

01:16:51.840 --> 01:16:54.742
She's left for good, maybe.

01:16:54.843 --> 01:16:56.577
Maybe this is what I deserve.

01:16:58.747 --> 01:17:02.650
Mr. Parish, maybe she's just
off thinking somewhere.

01:17:06.421 --> 01:17:09.824
Don't... don't...
Don't presume to know her, Sam,

01:17:09.925 --> 01:17:11.826
or know where she is, okay?

01:17:14.229 --> 01:17:16.664
You're just a kid.

01:17:16.765 --> 01:17:20.501
Now move.
It's why you're going home.

01:17:20.602 --> 01:17:23.104
I'm sorry, okay?

01:17:23.205 --> 01:17:25.873
<i>I'm sorry this is happening!</i>

01:17:25.974 --> 01:17:29.076
But I'm here!
I'm not running!

01:17:31.046 --> 01:17:33.681
<i>We were just trying
to do the right thing!</i>

01:17:33.782 --> 01:17:36.817
And Natalie was scared.

01:17:36.918 --> 01:17:39.199
She said she didn't want
to end up like her mother.

01:18:35.510 --> 01:18:37.011
This seat taken?

01:18:47.656 --> 01:18:49.523
I remember this place.

01:18:53.962 --> 01:18:55.329
You used to take me here

01:18:55.430 --> 01:18:57.990
when you'd follow mom,
didn't you?

01:19:02.137 --> 01:19:05.372
Natalie, my feelings about
your mother are...

01:19:05.474 --> 01:19:07.641
complicated.

01:19:10.479 --> 01:19:14.949
So you knew she was gonna
leave us.

01:19:15.050 --> 01:19:16.717
But you stayed with her

01:19:16.818 --> 01:19:19.420
the whole time in the hospital
whole time anyway.

01:19:19.521 --> 01:19:21.055
( sighs )

01:19:21.156 --> 01:19:25.126
When her boyfriend found out
that she was dying...

01:19:25.227 --> 01:19:28.095
he left.

01:19:28.196 --> 01:19:29.797
She didn't have anybody.

01:19:32.467 --> 01:19:34.635
You've got a stupid big heart.

01:19:37.639 --> 01:19:39.006
You know that, right?

01:19:43.879 --> 01:19:45.646
But I shouldn't
have lied to you.

01:19:48.350 --> 01:19:50.151
I just don't want you
to hate her.

01:19:52.621 --> 01:19:54.021
Well, I don't hate her.

01:19:56.691 --> 01:19:58.526
But I don't love her either.

01:20:03.398 --> 01:20:06.267
I mean, how can you really
have any feelings

01:20:06.368 --> 01:20:08.928
about someone that you
never really knew?

01:20:12.073 --> 01:20:14.633
All I ever really knew was you.

01:20:18.280 --> 01:20:21.448
( chuckles )
Bum luck.

01:20:21.550 --> 01:20:24.110
At least you make good sundaes.

01:20:33.962 --> 01:20:36.730
I think you might have
a date to the Winter Formal.

01:20:45.774 --> 01:20:48.334
Do you think I'm throwing
my life away?

01:20:50.979 --> 01:20:53.948
Nah, it's just a dance.

01:20:54.049 --> 01:20:55.382
Dad.

01:21:02.624 --> 01:21:04.825
Your future is just gonna be
as good or as bad

01:21:04.926 --> 01:21:06.493
as you want it to be.

01:21:06.595 --> 01:21:09.096
But what if I'm a bad mom?

01:21:13.468 --> 01:21:14.635
You won't be.

01:21:16.338 --> 01:21:17.638
That I'm certain of.

01:22:13.261 --> 01:22:17.164
I have to take my car.

01:22:17.265 --> 01:22:19.199
I'm sorry, I just...

01:22:19.301 --> 01:22:21.802
It's fine.
I'm happy you're okay.

01:22:26.541 --> 01:22:28.008
Thank you, Mr. Parish.

01:22:50.332 --> 01:22:51.832
Daddy...

01:22:55.403 --> 01:22:57.371
Just be careful.

01:23:19.761 --> 01:23:21.762
( sighs )
