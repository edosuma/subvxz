WEBVTT

00:08.508 --> 00:11.803
Before we begin,
I'd like to say how honoured I am

00:11.970 --> 00:13.639
to be taking over this spot.

00:13.847 --> 00:16.600
Obviously, I have
some rather big shoes to fill.

00:16.767 --> 00:18.769
My predecessor here
was much beloved.

00:18.977 --> 00:24.483
But I have never been one
to shrink from a challenge.

00:24.649 --> 00:26.068
And I'm sure that we'll all enjoy

00:26.193 --> 00:30.280
many happy years here together
in my new home.

00:30.447 --> 00:32.741
<i>Now, today on Medical Minute,</i>

00:32.908 --> 00:35.285
we're going to be tackling
the sticky subject of...

00:35.494 --> 00:37.662
Thank you, Dr. Crane.
Great audition.

00:37.871 --> 00:39.623
Really? That's all you need?

00:39.831 --> 00:42.042
I think we have a good idea
what you're all about.

00:42.584 --> 00:43.877
Excellent.

00:45.462 --> 00:47.797
- We'll be in touch.
- I'm sure you will.

00:47.964 --> 00:49.299
Next, please.

00:49.507 --> 00:51.676
Oh, formalities. Yes, I understand.

00:51.843 --> 00:53.845
Perhaps I'll just take a walk
around the station,

00:54.054 --> 00:57.432
check out the dressing rooms,
introduce myself to a few people.

00:57.640 --> 01:01.978
Say, you know, is there a sign-up list
for the softball team?

01:02.187 --> 01:05.190
I'm sure that Frasier "Slugger" Crane's
gonna be an asset to this station

01:05.355 --> 01:07.442
in more ways than one.

01:14.657 --> 01:15.825
Morning, Frasier.

01:16.075 --> 01:17.410
Oh, good morning, Dad.

01:17.577 --> 01:20.330
- Little early for the piano, isn't it?
- Yes, I'm sorry about that.

01:20.538 --> 01:23.374
I woke up this morning thinking
about that operetta I've been writing.

01:23.541 --> 01:25.710
You know, the one about
Robert and Elizabeth Browning.

01:25.877 --> 01:27.879
And I think...
Well, I just had to get right to it.

01:28.046 --> 01:30.214
Well, that's what I get for living
in a big city.

01:30.381 --> 01:31.883
If it's not the horns waking you up,

01:32.050 --> 01:34.385
it's someone writing an operetta
about the Brownings.

01:35.386 --> 01:37.513
Well, I'm pretty sure
that I've solved the problem.

01:37.722 --> 01:40.016
- Good for you.
- But I'd have to hear it to be sure.

01:40.183 --> 01:41.225
- I'll bet.
- Dad?

01:41.434 --> 01:42.435
- Forget it.
- Come on.

01:42.602 --> 01:45.688
- No, I've done it once, that's enough.
- Come on, it'll just take a minute.

01:45.855 --> 01:48.149
- I just want to do this one section.
- Oh, all right.

01:48.316 --> 01:50.026
But I'm not doing the accent.

01:50.234 --> 01:52.236
That's fine.

01:52.403 --> 01:54.906
All right, we'll take it from right here.

01:55.072 --> 01:56.115
- Fine.
- All right.

01:56.324 --> 01:58.117
<i>What is it that you feel?</i>

01:58.284 --> 01:59.702
<i>- Love
- Love</i>

01:59.869 --> 02:01.704
<i>That fear makes you conceal</i>

02:01.871 --> 02:03.289
<i>- Love
- Love</i>

02:03.456 --> 02:04.999
<i>The power's there to heal</i>

02:05.166 --> 02:06.542
<i>- Love
- Love</i>

02:06.709 --> 02:09.252
<i>Reveal!</i>

02:09.419 --> 02:12.798
<i>- Take me in your arms...
- I'm not doing this.</i>

02:13.007 --> 02:16.177
- All right, I'll sing it with Niles later.
- Oh, that'll cheer me up.

02:16.343 --> 02:17.928
Dad, be careful
of those sketches there.

02:18.137 --> 02:19.138
Sketches?

02:19.305 --> 02:21.474
Yes, I've been planning
on redecorating the apartment.

02:21.640 --> 02:23.976
I thought why not just design
my own furniture?

02:24.226 --> 02:27.229
Boy, Frasier, you know, you've been
taking on a lot of big projects lately.

02:27.396 --> 02:29.023
Well, Dad, you see, any moment

02:29.231 --> 02:31.275
that phone is going to ring
with another job offer,

02:31.442 --> 02:33.611
and this blessed little hiatus
will be over.

02:33.777 --> 02:36.697
I want to have achieved as many
of my life's ambitions as possible.

02:36.905 --> 02:39.116
Gee, Dad, frankly,
you should take up a project or two.

02:39.283 --> 02:42.119
Me? What are you talking about?
I'm doing stuff all the time.

02:42.286 --> 02:44.663
Why just this weekend,
I taught Eddie a great new trick.

02:44.830 --> 02:46.874
- Really?
- Come here, boy. Yeah, I'll show you.

02:47.041 --> 02:49.501
It starts out: I point a gun at him.

02:49.752 --> 02:50.878
I like it so far.

02:52.546 --> 02:56.508
Then I say,
"Freeze, punk, it's all over."

02:59.887 --> 03:02.014
It's all over.

03:02.890 --> 03:06.560
Oh, come on, Eddie,
you're supposed to go like this.

03:06.727 --> 03:07.769
Well done, Dad.

03:08.020 --> 03:11.106
Now you just have to teach Eddie
to say, "It's all over."

03:12.316 --> 03:14.776
- Can someone help me here?
- What is all that?

03:14.943 --> 03:17.112
Books Dr. Crane sent me
to get from the storage space.

03:17.279 --> 03:20.324
It's research I'm doing
for a novel I'm planning.

03:20.490 --> 03:22.993
Daphne, I was beginning to wonder
what was taking you so long.

03:23.243 --> 03:25.996
Well, forgive me,
but I did have to move three crates,

03:26.163 --> 03:29.458
a rowing machine and a cast-iron
bathtub out of the way first.

03:29.666 --> 03:32.961
Oh, look at that, the only book I really
wanted was in the shelf already.

03:33.170 --> 03:35.464
Here, Daphne,
you'll have to take these back down.

03:35.672 --> 03:37.340
Oh, my God, that's my duck!

03:37.591 --> 03:39.134
All right. Thank you, Daphne.

03:39.301 --> 03:41.553
When you're done, I need you
to run some errands for me.

03:41.720 --> 03:43.096
I need a very sturdy lemon zester,

03:43.263 --> 03:46.308
some more music paper,
some potting soil and an easel.

03:46.516 --> 03:48.518
Oh, be happy to.

03:48.727 --> 03:50.395
Then after that,
maybe I could draw a bath,

03:50.562 --> 03:52.314
strip you naked
and scrub you with a loofah.

03:52.480 --> 03:54.816
- Would that be all right, Dr. Crane?
- Yes.

03:57.319 --> 04:00.071
I didn't even see you standing there.

04:00.280 --> 04:03.742
- Can I talk to you about something?
- Yeah, just a second, Dad.

04:09.748 --> 04:11.541
Okay.

04:11.749 --> 04:12.792
Well, it's about Frasier.

04:12.959 --> 04:15.295
Ever since he got fired,
he's been so weird.

04:15.462 --> 04:16.963
All these projects he's got going.

04:17.172 --> 04:19.798
Yeah, don't worry, it's normal.
He's simply in a state of denial.

04:20.007 --> 04:22.427
- Denial about what?
- About getting fired.

04:22.594 --> 04:25.638
People like Frasier's whole identity
revolves around their job.

04:25.805 --> 04:28.266
The loss of the job is like a...
Like a death.

04:28.516 --> 04:30.685
They cope with it the same way
they would with a death,

04:30.852 --> 04:33.938
by going through a series of stages.
The first one's denial.

04:34.105 --> 04:35.940
Usually, that's followed by anger,
then...

04:36.107 --> 04:39.068
I've done it!
Escoffier's most difficult dish,

04:39.277 --> 04:40.570
done to tangy perfection.

04:40.737 --> 04:42.905
You know, sometimes I think
I may have missed my calling

04:43.072 --> 04:44.449
not becoming a gourmet chef.

04:45.032 --> 04:47.994
- I see we're still in stage one.
- Hello, Niles.

04:48.202 --> 04:49.996
Hey, Frasier,
you ready for our squash date?

04:50.163 --> 04:51.205
Oh, gosh, I'm so sorry.

04:51.372 --> 04:53.624
I'm gonna have to cancel.
I'll be cooking all morning.

04:53.875 --> 04:55.918
- What for?
- Actually, I'm holding a little picnic

04:56.085 --> 04:58.379
for the KACL employees
and their families.

04:58.588 --> 05:00.339
As you may recall,
I did get them all fired.

05:00.506 --> 05:01.591
Oh, yes.

05:01.757 --> 05:04.010
So I was just hoping
to make amends

05:04.176 --> 05:07.305
by serving up a little Duck a I'Orange
and an alfresco mea culpa.

05:07.471 --> 05:09.849
You know, people like chips
at a picnic too.

05:11.767 --> 05:13.602
Excuse me. Hello?

05:13.769 --> 05:14.854
Yes, Bebe.

05:15.062 --> 05:17.231
Yes. Yes, the television job.

05:17.440 --> 05:18.774
Oh, yes, yes.

05:19.734 --> 05:22.403
Oh, what a relief.

05:22.528 --> 05:24.113
Thank you. Bye-bye.

05:24.280 --> 05:26.157
- You got it?
- No, thank goodness.

05:26.407 --> 05:29.118
That job starts tomorrow.
I have got things to do.

05:29.326 --> 05:31.495
Oh, I'm sorry, Frasier.

05:31.704 --> 05:33.956
Sorry?
My God, you sound just like Dad.

05:34.123 --> 05:37.084
I am going to get another job.
The people of this city need me.

05:37.251 --> 05:39.628
I'm a beloved Seattle institution.

05:39.837 --> 05:41.005
Couple of more days like this,

05:41.171 --> 05:43.299
he's gonna be
in a beloved Seattle institution.

05:48.971 --> 05:51.890
Hey, doc. Roz.
Wait till you hear this.

05:52.057 --> 05:53.434
- I got a job today.
- Really?

05:53.600 --> 05:54.643
- Oh, my God.
- Good, good.

05:54.810 --> 05:56.812
- You ought to rub me for good luck.
- Where?

05:57.062 --> 05:59.273
Well, start on my knee.
Work your way up.

05:59.732 --> 06:00.899
Where's the job?

06:01.150 --> 06:03.402
Oh, it's that new all-sports station.

06:03.569 --> 06:04.820
I got the breakfast slot.

06:04.987 --> 06:06.780
I even came up with a slogan:

06:06.947 --> 06:10.242
"Coffee, eggs and Bulldog."

06:10.409 --> 06:13.370
Sounds like some sort
of a Malaysian Happy Meal.

06:14.913 --> 06:17.040
A word of caution on the hummus:

06:17.207 --> 06:21.044
To be avoided, as a leper
would avoid a Magic Teacup ride.

06:21.253 --> 06:22.796
Gil, Frasier made that.

06:23.463 --> 06:26.842
- Oh, I'm so sorry.
- It's quite all right. I understand.

06:27.009 --> 06:29.720
You need to flex your critical muscles
while you're between jobs.

06:29.845 --> 06:31.430
Oh, good.
Then you might enjoy this one:

06:31.680 --> 06:34.307
After sampling your
unnuanced baba ganoush,

06:34.474 --> 06:37.018
I was tempted to describe
your entire Middle Eastern buffet

06:37.185 --> 06:39.229
as "The Sorrow and the Pita."

06:39.646 --> 06:42.983
Oh, who's got a pencil?
I've got to write that one down.

06:43.191 --> 06:44.609
- Hi, everybody.
- Oh, Tooty.

06:44.818 --> 06:48.071
- Hey.
- I got the most exciting news today.

06:48.280 --> 06:51.741
<i>They just picked up my
Storytime Theatre on public television.</i>

06:51.950 --> 06:53.410
- Hey, all right.
- That's wonderful.

06:53.618 --> 06:56.913
Talk about
living happily ever after, huh?

06:59.332 --> 07:01.835
- Hey, Dr. Crane.
- Oh, well, Kenny.

07:02.085 --> 07:03.712
Great party. Oh, by the way,

07:03.878 --> 07:06.172
I picked something up for you
on my way to work today.

07:06.548 --> 07:07.716
- Work?
- Yeah, yeah.

07:07.882 --> 07:10.009
They took me back at my old job:

07:10.176 --> 07:13.596
Anyway, I was passing
the bus stop and...

07:13.763 --> 07:15.682
Excuse me a second.

07:17.600 --> 07:19.644
Anyway, they were about
to paper over your poster,

07:19.811 --> 07:20.895
so I peeled it off for you.

07:21.062 --> 07:24.107
Well, that is quite a keepsake.

07:24.315 --> 07:25.400
Don't mention it.

07:25.608 --> 07:28.778
By the way, the poster under yours
was an old radio guy, Dr. Earl?

07:28.945 --> 07:29.988
Who was he again?

07:30.196 --> 07:32.323
You know, I'm sorry, I don't recall.

07:32.532 --> 07:33.575
Yeah, I'm the same way.

07:33.783 --> 07:35.410
Once they're off the air,
who remembers?

07:37.036 --> 07:38.871
Do you realise
we're the only people here

07:38.997 --> 07:40.873
- without a job?
- Roz...

07:41.040 --> 07:43.501
If we don't get this Talk 100 spot,
there may not be any left.

07:43.668 --> 07:46.129
Roz, I've told you
we have nothing to worry about.

07:46.337 --> 07:48.005
Now, come on. Everyone?

07:48.172 --> 07:50.174
If I could have your attention, please.

07:50.341 --> 07:54.137
We, of course, have planned some
activities for today's little get-together.

07:54.303 --> 07:56.305
And I'd like to start
with one for the children.

07:56.848 --> 08:01.769
Now, what we have here
is an authentic Mexican piñata.

08:01.978 --> 08:08.651
The object is to take the stick
and give it a little whack...

08:08.859 --> 08:12.238
Bravo for me.
I just got the Talk 100 job.

08:13.656 --> 08:17.952
Oh, well, good for you, Gil.

08:18.619 --> 08:23.499
Yes, you're gonna wanna give
this little fellow a good crack.

08:23.749 --> 08:26.210
Otherwise... You know,
maybe I better get this started for you.

08:26.377 --> 08:28.254
Otherwise,
the candy will never come out.

08:29.588 --> 08:32.924
And everybody knows
keeping something locked up inside

08:33.092 --> 08:37.221
is never good for anyone, is it?

08:39.000 --> 08:45.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

08:49.275 --> 08:50.818
Hello?

08:51.068 --> 08:53.278
Yes, Bebe. We did hear the news.

08:53.445 --> 08:56.323
And how thrilling for Gil.

08:56.490 --> 08:58.200
Could you hold, please?

09:08.627 --> 09:10.462
<i>What is this I feel?</i>

09:10.629 --> 09:12.422
<i>Love</i>

09:12.589 --> 09:14.633
<i>That fear makes me conceal</i>

09:14.800 --> 09:16.426
<i>Love</i>

09:16.635 --> 09:17.803
Dad?

09:17.970 --> 09:19.846
Was I doing it again?

09:20.055 --> 09:21.848
Was I doing it
before Mrs. Walsh got off?

09:22.057 --> 09:23.350
That's why Mrs. Walsh got off.

09:25.936 --> 09:28.272
- So how's Frasier doing?
- Oh, he's getting weirder.

09:28.438 --> 09:30.357
He beat up a piñata yesterday.

09:31.066 --> 09:32.609
Isn't that what you're supposed to do?

09:32.859 --> 09:33.860
Not like this.

09:34.069 --> 09:36.738
They found a jawbreaker
on the other side of the highway.

09:38.240 --> 09:39.658
Oh, well, this is good.

09:39.825 --> 09:41.576
It means he's reached
the anger stage.

09:41.785 --> 09:43.787
In due course,
he'll go through bargaining,

09:43.995 --> 09:46.581
- depression and finally acceptance.
- What's bargaining?

09:46.790 --> 09:50.168
It's like when a person makes a deal
with God to spare their life.

09:50.377 --> 09:53.421
Oh, yeah, I know all about that.

09:53.588 --> 09:55.465
I remember right after I got shot,
I said:

09:55.632 --> 09:58.593
"God, if I promise never to drink
another bottle of Ballantine's,

09:58.760 --> 10:00.929
will you let me get through this?"

10:01.096 --> 10:04.641
- Dad, you still drink Ballantine's.
- Not in bottles, baby.

10:07.602 --> 10:11.523
You're just in time.
I'm throwing a party for my fan club.

10:11.773 --> 10:12.774
Here?

10:12.941 --> 10:16.027
Is there some problem with the bridge
they normally meet under?

10:16.861 --> 10:18.696
Very amusing, Niles.

10:19.114 --> 10:23.993
You see, I've been doing
a lot of soul-searching lately,

10:25.995 --> 10:32.126
and last night, I did something I haven't
done since I was a very little boy.

10:32.877 --> 10:38.925
I got down on my knees at my bedside,
and I prayed for guidance.

10:40.718 --> 10:41.844
And I asked God:

10:43.221 --> 10:47.475
"What can I do
to get my old life back?"

10:47.642 --> 10:50.061
And the answer came:

10:50.269 --> 10:54.315
"Take better care of your fans."

11:01.697 --> 11:03.825
- God told you that?
- Yes.

11:05.993 --> 11:08.829
I have taken my public for granted.

11:08.996 --> 11:13.834
I take weeks before I answer
my fan mail, if I answer it at all.

11:14.794 --> 11:17.088
I've been a bad celebrity.

11:18.965 --> 11:21.968
- But no more.
- I didn't even know you had a fan club.

11:22.093 --> 11:25.054
Well, actually,
they meet on the Internet,

11:25.221 --> 11:29.308
and I visited their website yesterday
for the first time.

11:29.475 --> 11:31.310
Bad celebrity.

11:32.269 --> 11:34.188
But I invited them all here,
and you know what?

11:34.396 --> 11:35.940
They were so grateful
that before long,

11:36.148 --> 11:37.775
I mean, God,
suddenly they were proposing

11:37.942 --> 11:39.652
that they hold a massive rally
in my honour

11:39.819 --> 11:41.487
demanding that I return
to the airwaves.

11:41.654 --> 11:43.572
You know, I think it's safe to say

11:43.739 --> 11:48.244
that someone is already working
in mysterious ways.

11:48.619 --> 11:51.497
Someone sure as hell is.

11:51.664 --> 11:53.040
Some of the crab puffs, Dr. Crane?

11:53.207 --> 11:55.376
No, no, thank you.
Just keep those away from me.

11:55.584 --> 11:57.503
Won't be long
before I'm back in the public eye,

11:57.670 --> 11:59.213
and I've got to remain fighting trim.

11:59.380 --> 12:01.215
- Oh, Daphne.
- What you got there?

12:01.465 --> 12:03.300
Just a box of Dr. Crane's
publicity photos

12:03.509 --> 12:05.135
from the storage cubby.

12:05.302 --> 12:07.721
- Thank you.
- This flashlight sure came in handy.

12:07.888 --> 12:11.308
Helped me to find that box
way up on the top of that old bookcase.

12:11.475 --> 12:13.352
And when that thing flew in my hair,

12:13.519 --> 12:16.605
I had something
to beat it to death with.

12:19.191 --> 12:22.402
Oh, good Lord, our first arrivals.
God, I've got to check the food.

12:22.569 --> 12:24.238
Daphne,
will you run to the store for me?

12:24.404 --> 12:26.949
I need felt tip pens to sign
these pictures with, do you mind?

12:27.115 --> 12:29.868
Sure. What else have I got to do?

12:30.911 --> 12:33.080
Hi, Daphne. It's Daphne.

12:33.580 --> 12:35.415
Hello. Have we met?

12:35.624 --> 12:38.543
<i>- We know you from the magazine.
- April '96, Seattle Monthly.</i>

12:38.752 --> 12:41.880
"At Home With Dr. Frasier Crane."
You wore an orange-flowered dress.

12:42.047 --> 12:43.715
And your hair was different then.

12:43.924 --> 12:46.760
Oh, how creepy. Do come in.

12:47.886 --> 12:49.846
Come in. Come in.

12:50.013 --> 12:53.350
- I'm Dr. Frasier Crane.
- Wow, hi.

12:53.558 --> 12:54.684
- Hello.
- Doris Buckley.

12:54.851 --> 12:55.977
- Doris.
- Aaron Fitch.

12:56.144 --> 12:58.438
Aaron.
Oh, it's such a pleasure to meet you.

12:58.647 --> 13:01.066
You know, perhaps
I should introduce these people to you.

13:01.233 --> 13:02.692
We know who they are.

13:02.901 --> 13:04.986
And now where we live.

13:06.446 --> 13:08.114
Oh, don't be shy.

13:08.323 --> 13:10.033
- Come in, come in.
- This is great.

13:10.200 --> 13:11.618
This is great.

13:13.244 --> 13:15.288
I'm Dr. Frasier Crane.
It's a pleasure to meet you.

13:15.455 --> 13:17.874
This is great. This is great.

13:21.211 --> 13:24.130
It's cool, isn't it?
Your brother having his own club.

13:24.631 --> 13:29.344
Yeah, well, seeing all of you,
I sort of wish I had a club myself.

13:32.222 --> 13:34.432
You know, perhaps
you'd like to fill out these nametags.

13:34.599 --> 13:37.393
- We'll wait for everyone else to come.
- Who else is coming?

13:37.602 --> 13:41.397
- Well, the rest of the fan club.
- This is the fan club, the three of us.

13:41.606 --> 13:44.484
Well, I'll be off
to get those pens now.

13:47.445 --> 13:50.073
You know, perhaps you should
all help yourself to some food.

13:50.239 --> 13:54.035
Niles, may I have
a word with you, please?

13:55.745 --> 13:57.705
Niles!

14:02.710 --> 14:05.379
I can't let them hold that rally.
Three kooks marching in a circle.

14:05.546 --> 14:09.300
- Do you know what that will do?
- Make them very dizzy very fast.

14:09.509 --> 14:10.551
Make me a laughingstock.

14:10.718 --> 14:13.054
I'll never work in this town again.
I've got to stop them.

14:13.262 --> 14:16.432
Sorry to interrupt,
but I need to carve the second turkey.

14:17.350 --> 14:19.060
No fighting
over drumsticks at this party.

14:19.227 --> 14:20.311
Stop it.

14:20.895 --> 14:21.938
How's everyone out here?

14:22.188 --> 14:23.898
Great.
We were just talking about the rally.

14:24.106 --> 14:26.901
- Really? I'm glad you brought that up.
- They had it this afternoon.

14:27.151 --> 14:29.362
- In front of city hall.
- It couldn't have gone better.

14:29.528 --> 14:33.407
George stopped traffic by lying across
the road on a psychiatrist's couch.

14:33.574 --> 14:36.077
- The cameramen sure loved that.
- Cameramen?

14:36.285 --> 14:38.746
What are we doing?
It's almost time for the 6:00 news.

14:38.913 --> 14:40.498
You're gonna love this, Dr. Crane.

14:40.664 --> 14:42.500
- What have you got there?
- The crab puffs.

14:42.708 --> 14:46.086
- Shall I get you something else?
- Yes, please, bring me spring rolls.

14:47.129 --> 14:50.049
<i>Now, on the lighter side,
did you ever ask yourself</i>

14:50.216 --> 14:52.927
<i>what if they held a rally
and nobody came?</i>

14:54.637 --> 14:57.973
This is great. This is great.

14:58.140 --> 15:01.435
Eighty-six the spring rolls.
Bring me the freaking turkey.

15:10.319 --> 15:12.029
- Frasier?
- Yeah, Dad.

15:12.196 --> 15:14.490
You think we could talk
for a second in the living room?

15:14.656 --> 15:17.993
Yeah, sure.
Gee, sounds kind of serious.

15:18.160 --> 15:21.622
- Yeah, it is, kind of.
- Well, what is it?

15:22.414 --> 15:24.708
Oh, Roz, I didn't hear you come in.

15:24.917 --> 15:27.419
I think you had the blender going.

15:28.545 --> 15:33.634
Frasier, we were wondering,
do you think you might be depressed?

15:33.800 --> 15:34.843
Depressed?

15:35.052 --> 15:38.180
Well, we've all noticed
that you've put on weight lately.

15:38.972 --> 15:41.933
We're worried
that you might be eating obsessively.

15:42.142 --> 15:45.103
Maybe I've gained a pound or two,
but it's nothing I can't handle.

15:45.312 --> 15:47.314
So you think you've got
everything under control?

15:47.564 --> 15:50.067
- Absolutely.
- It's time, Roz.

15:50.275 --> 15:53.111
Remember when I had that babysitter
who was stealing from me,

15:53.278 --> 15:55.238
so I had to put in
the hidden camera?

15:55.739 --> 15:56.782
Yes.

15:56.990 --> 15:59.117
And you remember
when you babysat for me?

15:59.284 --> 16:02.996
- What about it?
- Just watch this.

16:03.413 --> 16:06.374
<i>Well, I think it's mealtime,
baby Alice.</i>

16:06.541 --> 16:09.044
<i>Let's see what's on tonight's menu.</i>

16:09.252 --> 16:12.672
<i>Oh, yes, strained beef
and lima beans.</i>

16:12.839 --> 16:15.884
All right, point taken,
I've put on a pound or two.

16:16.092 --> 16:18.803
But the camera adds ten.

16:18.970 --> 16:20.388
<i>Open up. Come on.</i>

16:20.764 --> 16:22.932
<i>Come on, come on.</i>

16:23.141 --> 16:26.728
<i>You know, it's very good.
Here, I'll show you, here.</i>

16:28.605 --> 16:30.815
<i>Oh, my.
All right, now it's your turn.</i>

16:30.982 --> 16:33.610
<i>Now, come on. No?</i>

16:33.818 --> 16:36.780
<i>Still? Well, you know,
that's not even a proper spoonful.</i>

16:36.946 --> 16:39.407
<i>Let's get you a full one.</i>

16:41.034 --> 16:42.076
<i>That's a nice big one.</i>

16:42.285 --> 16:45.580
<i>You know what?
Let's try something else.</i>

16:45.747 --> 16:48.833
<i>How about some puréed chicken
and yams?</i>

16:49.000 --> 16:52.211
<i>This looks very good.
Now, here we are.</i>

16:52.378 --> 16:58.092
<i>All right, here we go.
Come on, open up, open up.</i>

16:58.217 --> 17:01.220
<i>No? Well, if you're not hungry,
you're not hungry.</i>

17:01.888 --> 17:03.181
<i>Oh, my.</i>

17:03.347 --> 17:08.310
<i>Wow, it's actually pretty good
together. Let's try that.</i>

17:10.605 --> 17:12.773
<i>What's that you have
in your sippy cup there?</i>

17:12.940 --> 17:15.859
<i>- Is that apple juice?
- Oh, all right, enough, turn it off.</i>

17:16.109 --> 17:18.654
Well, I guess maybe you're right.
I am depressed.

17:18.820 --> 17:19.864
What of it?

17:20.071 --> 17:23.451
Well, we're just trying to help you
to get to, you know, the next stage.

17:23.867 --> 17:26.829
- Stage of what?
- Frasier...

17:27.538 --> 17:30.708
...you're dealing with the loss of your
job as many people do with a death.

17:30.916 --> 17:33.002
Only you've got yourself
stalled in depression.

17:33.169 --> 17:34.628
And I think you're gonna stay there

17:34.795 --> 17:38.466
until you let yourself grieve
for everything you've lost.

17:38.966 --> 17:44.805
Your job, your friends.
The money, your reputation...

17:46.557 --> 17:48.309
You've gotta let it out, Frasier.

17:50.019 --> 17:53.189
Well, I thank you all
very much for your concern,

17:53.355 --> 17:54.398
but you know what?

17:54.607 --> 17:58.819
If I was repressing anything,
I would certainly know it.

18:00.446 --> 18:02.281
The only thing I need to let out

18:02.489 --> 18:05.409
are these so-called
big-and-tall lounge pants.

18:07.328 --> 18:09.079
- Well, that went well.
- Yeah.

18:09.288 --> 18:11.665
- Well, we gave it a shot.
- What will we do now?

18:11.832 --> 18:14.543
Well, we can't push him.
If he's not ready, he's not ready.

18:16.462 --> 18:19.548
- What was that?
- Was that Frasier?

18:19.757 --> 18:21.383
If anyone's hungry,

18:21.550 --> 18:24.803
there's a freshly made
Monte Cristo in the waffle press.

18:25.012 --> 18:26.847
Oh, great. Thanks, Fras.

18:28.974 --> 18:30.726
Dr. Crane, you all right?

18:31.518 --> 18:33.520
- Yes.
- Are you sure?

18:33.729 --> 18:34.938
I'm quite sure.

18:37.482 --> 18:42.029
Frasier, you're not famous anymore.

18:45.574 --> 18:48.452
- What the hell did you do that for?
- No, no, Dad, he needed a push.

18:48.618 --> 18:49.661
Yeah? Well, look at him.

18:49.870 --> 18:51.371
- This can't be good.
- No, it is good.

18:51.538 --> 18:52.956
Let it all out, Frasier.

18:53.165 --> 18:55.167
Let it all out. That's good.
That's right, Frasier.

18:55.333 --> 18:57.044
Let it out. Okay.

18:57.210 --> 19:00.338
Okay. All right.

19:01.089 --> 19:03.675
Yeah, I think
that's probably enough now.

19:03.884 --> 19:05.302
Okay.

19:05.510 --> 19:07.137
- How much more can be in there?
- Okay.

19:08.555 --> 19:10.307
Okay. All right.

19:10.473 --> 19:12.684
Yeah, that's probably enough now.

19:12.851 --> 19:15.353
Okay.
I don't think I can get him to stop.

19:15.520 --> 19:17.647
- But this is sickening.
- Yeah, what are we gonna do?

19:17.856 --> 19:20.984
Somebody get
that Monte Cristo in here.

19:22.027 --> 19:24.779
Frasier, it's all
in how you look at things.

19:24.946 --> 19:26.698
Look at my life.

19:26.865 --> 19:29.993
No career, no relationship,
no hope...

19:30.160 --> 19:31.911
You can say
the same thing about me.

19:32.078 --> 19:35.915
I was talking about you.

19:36.499 --> 19:39.878
Dr. Crane,
my Grammy Moon had a saying...

19:40.795 --> 19:42.255
What are you trying to do, kill him?

19:43.047 --> 19:46.050
Well, don't blame this on me.
She brought the bloody tape over.

19:46.217 --> 19:48.761
Oh, so now this is all my fault.
You saw that tape.

19:49.012 --> 19:51.806
I've seen your baby too.
She could stand to miss a meal or two.

19:52.056 --> 19:53.558
- She's a healthy baby.
- Oh, stop it.

19:53.725 --> 19:57.812
Stop it, all of you.
There is no hope.

19:58.021 --> 20:02.483
It's over. It's all over.

20:06.070 --> 20:08.406
Well, look at that.

20:08.990 --> 20:11.367
I'm so proud of you, boy.

20:11.868 --> 20:13.619
Dad, you're just saying that.

20:22.670 --> 20:24.547
- Hello, Niles.
- Frasier, please join me.

20:24.714 --> 20:26.007
Thank you very much.

20:26.174 --> 20:27.592
- I would love to have...
- Wait.

20:27.800 --> 20:30.803
Mochaccino, extra whipped cream
and a Linzer Torte, right?

20:31.387 --> 20:33.180
Not anymore.

20:33.347 --> 20:35.933
I'll just have a non-fat latte, please.

20:36.392 --> 20:40.062
- Hey, didn't you used to...?
- Yes, yes, I used to be on the radio.

20:40.229 --> 20:42.732
With any luck, I will be again.

20:42.940 --> 20:44.734
Thank you for remembering.
It does help.

20:44.984 --> 20:48.070
I was just gonna say, didn't you also
used to get a bear claw?

20:50.990 --> 20:52.825
Off you go.

20:54.243 --> 20:56.829
Well, Frasier,
I just have to say bravo.

20:57.455 --> 20:58.789
You're slim, well-adjusted.

20:58.956 --> 21:00.916
You've really turned things around,
haven't you?

21:01.167 --> 21:05.254
Well, it's easy once you hit
rock bottom and bounce.

21:07.464 --> 21:10.801
Thank you, Niles,
I couldn't have done it without you.

21:11.844 --> 21:13.679
I did nothing
you wouldn't have done for me.

21:14.763 --> 21:16.265
And you'll be happy to know

21:16.515 --> 21:18.225
my own life
is on quite the upswing as well.

21:18.392 --> 21:19.476
Really?

21:19.643 --> 21:22.062
I just got back from a meeting
with Maris and her lawyers.

21:22.271 --> 21:23.313
Oh, and?

21:24.106 --> 21:27.443
I think this divorce
is going to go very smoothly.
