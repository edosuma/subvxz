- Here. Hold on to that. Hold on to that.

01:34:55.080 --> 01:34:58.209
Keep your eye on that. If he can't breathe,
you pull the plunger again.

01:34:58.360 --> 01:34:59.566
- Okay?
- Okay

01:34:59.720 --> 01:35:02.451
Good Lord, I cannot believe
that you made me shoot you.

01:35:02.600 --> 01:35:06.286
And then for what? So that you can make
cow eyes at some race skank!

01:35:06.920 --> 01:35:09.127
- She is not a race skank!
- I'm not a race skank!

01:35:09.280 --> 01:35:11.760
You die with the lie, Mellow...

01:35:11.920 --> 01:35:13.809
...and you still just might.

01:35:13.960 --> 01:35:16.201
- Fuck you. Don't call me "Mellow."
OWENS: Jesus Christ.

01:35:16.360 --> 01:35:17.805
You're his dad?

01:35:17.960 --> 01:35:20.281
In the loosest fucking possible terms.

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:22.331
I'm Bucky, by the way.

01:35:22.760 --> 01:35:25.000
You know, I like you, honey.
You can take a punch. Ha-ha.

01:35:25.600 --> 01:35:27.329
NICKY: God.
- And there it is.

01:35:27.480 --> 01:35:30.450
Tell you what, you steal us a car,
and I'll gather up the money.

01:35:30.600 --> 01:35:31.931
I can't steal a car.

01:35:39.800 --> 01:35:43.566
OWENS: I've been working
for this prick Spaniard for three years...

01:35:43.720 --> 01:35:46.405
...and he's got a guy at McEwen
and doesn't tell me?

01:35:46.560 --> 01:35:48.801
What the hell ever happened to trust?

01:35:48.960 --> 01:35:50.485
Are we almost there?

01:35:50.680 --> 01:35:53.843
I bust my ass to get you
that EXR crap and... Agh.

01:35:54.680 --> 01:35:56.330
And then the girl walked in.

01:35:56.520 --> 01:35:58.841
[GROANING]
Don't be an asshole.

01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:00.843
That any way to talk to your father?

01:36:01.840 --> 01:36:04.411
You're not my father.
You walked away.

01:36:05.600 --> 01:36:06.840
[SIGHS]

01:36:14.600 --> 01:36:16.523
I took you off the street.

01:36:16.680 --> 01:36:19.604
Taught you my trade,
I taught you my passion.

01:36:21.480 --> 01:36:23.881
Three generations of skills.

01:36:26.120 --> 01:36:31.001
Ah. And in spite of all my earnest efforts,
in spite of all my hard work...

01:36:31.160 --> 01:36:33.288
...you turned into a good person.

01:36:33.440 --> 01:36:34.805
Well, I just...

01:36:35.360 --> 01:36:37.089
Ah. Go figure.

01:36:37.960 --> 01:36:38.961
[SIGHS]

01:36:39.120 --> 01:36:43.284
And I left you on the street
for a good goddamn reason.

01:36:43.480 --> 01:36:46.723
- Because I was soft.
- Oh, that just shows what you know...

01:36:46.880 --> 01:36:49.167
...you dumb son of a bitch.

01:36:56.840 --> 01:36:58.729
We had a good thing going.

01:37:00.840 --> 01:37:02.808
And then one day...

01:37:04.200 --> 01:37:07.249
...like seven years in, we're running
this poker deal in Boston...

01:37:07.400 --> 01:37:09.050
...and a guy pulled a gun.

01:37:09.200 --> 01:37:10.770
Fucking gun. Glock.

01:37:10.920 --> 01:37:12.729
First time I'd ever seen one.

01:37:12.880 --> 01:37:15.326
And I'm just paralyzed.

01:37:16.880 --> 01:37:18.166
Heh.

01:37:18.320 --> 01:37:21.369
And all I could think about was the kid.

01:37:23.040 --> 01:37:26.249
That night I walked.
I never looked back.

01:37:31.040 --> 01:37:33.281
Love'll get you killed in this racket.

01:37:34.920 --> 01:37:36.843
No place for that shit here.

01:37:37.560 --> 01:37:39.369
No happiness with that.

01:37:42.160 --> 01:37:45.448
You know how they say
there's honor among thieves.

01:37:46.440 --> 01:37:48.442
Well, you're no thief, Mellow.

01:37:51.400 --> 01:37:53.084
You made your choice.

01:37:57.880 --> 01:38:00.360
- So I'm taking the money.
- Mmm.

01:38:01.280 --> 01:38:02.645
All of it.

01:38:03.760 --> 01:38:06.081
- Mm-mm.
OWENS: Uh-huh.

01:38:06.240 --> 01:38:07.890
[GROANS]

01:38:10.440 --> 01:38:12.249
Well, that explains a lot.

01:38:12.400 --> 01:38:13.970
Yeah, that's Dad.

01:38:15.480 --> 01:38:18.802
- No.
- Yep.

01:38:18.960 --> 01:38:20.849
[GROANS]

01:38:21.520 --> 01:38:23.124
[KNOCKING ON GLASS]

01:38:23.400 --> 01:38:24.845
See you at Christmas.

01:38:32.480 --> 01:38:34.482
JESS:
<i>One, two, ready?</i>

01:38:35.480 --> 01:38:37.482
Okay, that's good, that's good.

01:38:37.680 --> 01:38:41.002
- Mm.
- Okay, almost there.

01:38:41.600 --> 01:38:43.967
I don't know what we're gonna do now.

01:38:45.840 --> 01:38:47.205
We'll be fine.

01:38:47.800 --> 01:38:49.006
How?

01:38:49.960 --> 01:38:51.200
Trust me.

01:38:59.600 --> 01:39:01.887
- Oh. I got you.
- Agh.

01:39:02.600 --> 01:39:03.886
I got you.

01:39:12.360 --> 01:39:13.964
