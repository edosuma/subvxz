WEBVTT

00:01.792 --> 00:03.250
-NARRATOR: Tonight...
-Onward, Captain.
-Let's go!

00:03.375 --> 00:05.167
NARRATOR:
...on <i>Beyond Oak Island...</i>

00:05.250 --> 00:06.333
Well, today's the day we're
going to find some treasure.

00:06.458 --> 00:07.708
I'll tell you that much
right now.

00:07.833 --> 00:09.000
MARTY:
We're treasure-hunting

00:09.083 --> 00:10.042
on the <i>Atocha,</i>
one of the richest

00:10.208 --> 00:12.042
Spanish galleons ever.

00:12.167 --> 00:14.542
We grew up with that legend.

00:14.667 --> 00:16.667
Good hunting! Diver's in!

00:16.792 --> 00:18.083
MELVIN:
We named this area
"Emerald City."

00:18.208 --> 00:19.333
We're treasure hunting, fellas.

00:19.458 --> 00:21.167
Come on, baby.
Bring me some green.

00:21.292 --> 00:22.917
MATTY:
I think our hot hand
got something.

00:23.042 --> 00:24.042
Oh, yeah. We definitely
have something.

00:24.208 --> 00:26.333
-What do you got?
-And here...

00:26.417 --> 00:27.625
(indistinct,
overlapping chatter)

00:27.750 --> 00:29.125
Wow.

00:30.083 --> 00:32.625
All the while
we were growing up,

00:32.750 --> 00:36.125
my brother and I were fascinated
with finding treasure.

00:37.167 --> 00:37.958
RICK:
Pirate treasure,

00:38.083 --> 00:39.750
cursed treasure.

00:39.875 --> 00:41.500
Civil War gold.

00:41.667 --> 00:44.417
-(laughter)
-Since then,
our work on Oak Island

00:44.542 --> 00:46.833
has shown us
there's a world of mysteries...

00:46.917 --> 00:49.625
-Whoa.
-...waiting to be explored.

00:49.708 --> 00:52.458
RICK:
So, we like to reach out
to other treasure hunters.

00:52.583 --> 00:54.750
X marks the spot, right there.
Brilliant.

00:54.875 --> 00:57.208
-MARTY: We want to hear
their stories...
-That's right.

00:57.375 --> 00:59.583
-...and share our insights.
-"Ill-gotten gains."

00:59.708 --> 01:01.167
-RICK: And who knows...
-GARY: I got it.

01:01.250 --> 01:03.000
...maybe we can help them
with their search.

01:03.125 --> 01:04.667
MARTY:
Not only in America.

01:04.792 --> 01:06.333
Wow. That is gold.

01:06.417 --> 01:08.250
-RICK: But all over the world.
-Yeah!

01:08.375 --> 01:10.167
MARTY:
<i>Beyond Oak Island.</i>

01:18.375 --> 01:20.500
Well, Marty, you're kind of
home here in Florida.

01:20.583 --> 01:22.833
Yeah, that's right.
You talk about history,

01:23.000 --> 01:26.792
there's a lot of history here.
Every-every rumrunner, pirate,

01:26.917 --> 01:29.000
-scalawag in the universe...
-Uh-huh.

01:29.125 --> 01:31.333
-...called this home
at one time.
-Yeah.

01:31.500 --> 01:33.500
NARRATOR: Off the coast
of Key West, Florida,

01:33.625 --> 01:37.167
Rick and Marty Lagina,
along with Matty Blake,

01:37.292 --> 01:39.792
are heading out some 40 miles

01:39.875 --> 01:43.708
to one of the most storied
locations in the Atlantic Ocean.

01:45.250 --> 01:48.333
There, they will rendezvous
with Melvin Abt--

01:48.458 --> 01:52.375
the grandson of the legendary
treasure hunter Mel Fisher--

01:52.500 --> 01:55.000
where the Fisher family
and their team continue

01:55.125 --> 01:57.667
a 37-year salvage operation

01:57.750 --> 02:01.333
of the famous shipwreck
known as the <i>Atocha.</i>

02:01.500 --> 02:03.667
RICK:
The thing for me is, you know,

02:03.792 --> 02:05.208
the treasure aspect is
important, but learning

02:05.375 --> 02:07.417
about the Fisher family

02:07.542 --> 02:08.833
and what they've accomplished
over the years--

02:09.000 --> 02:10.333
I think that's going
to be fascinating.

02:10.417 --> 02:12.208
This is completely legendary,

02:12.333 --> 02:14.250
and it's a gigantic
success story,

02:14.375 --> 02:17.333
but-but the thing that
gives me hope is that I think

02:17.417 --> 02:19.625
they were at it longer
than we have been

02:19.708 --> 02:21.625
on Oak Island
before they found something.

02:21.708 --> 02:22.875
-Yeah. Yeah.
-I'm pretty sure.
We'll find it out.

02:23.000 --> 02:24.417
No, it's exciting.

02:24.542 --> 02:27.000
We're going to be
over a 1622 shipwreck,

02:27.125 --> 02:30.292
-not maybe, for sure.
-Definitely.
-Yeah.

02:30.417 --> 02:34.875
NARRATOR:
On September 4, 1622,

02:35.042 --> 02:39.167
the <i>Nuestra Se√±ora de Atocha,</i>
a 550-ton Spanish galleon,

02:39.250 --> 02:41.833
set sail from Havana, Cuba,

02:41.958 --> 02:44.833
transporting one of the
most bountiful treasure cargos

02:44.917 --> 02:47.500
ever recorded back to Spain.

02:47.625 --> 02:50.167
NESVIG:
The <i>Atocha</i> was part of

02:50.333 --> 02:54.042
the royal fleet that sailed
between the Americas and Spain.

02:54.208 --> 02:57.500
And it was carrying
a very large, sizable treasure.

02:57.583 --> 03:00.708
Probably at least
24 tons of silver,

03:00.833 --> 03:04.542
more than 3,000 emeralds--
which were from Muzo, Colombia,

03:04.667 --> 03:07.500
home of the best emeralds
in the world--

03:07.625 --> 03:10.750
some 700 very
substantial stones,

03:10.875 --> 03:15.500
and then maybe another 2,500
medium or smaller-sized stones.

03:15.625 --> 03:20.208
It also had more than
100,000 silver coins.

03:20.333 --> 03:22.917
-(thunderclap)
-NARRATOR:
However, just two days

03:23.042 --> 03:24.542
into her journey,

03:24.708 --> 03:27.000
disaster struck
when the ship was caught

03:27.125 --> 03:30.250
in a severe hurricane off
the southern coast of Florida.

03:30.375 --> 03:33.375
It quickly sank,
resulting in the deaths

03:33.500 --> 03:37.583
of 260 of her 265 passengers,

03:37.708 --> 03:41.167
and leaving the billions
in precious valuables lost

03:41.292 --> 03:43.583
for more than four centuries.

03:43.708 --> 03:47.917
NESVIG:
The Spanish attempted
to salvage the treasure,

03:48.042 --> 03:49.667
but they did not
find the <i>Atocha.</i>

03:49.792 --> 03:52.583
NARRATOR:
But in 1973,

03:52.708 --> 03:55.333
a former Indiana-born
chicken farmer

03:55.458 --> 03:57.667
turned treasure hunter
named Mel Fisher

03:57.833 --> 04:01.708
made history with his wife and
partner, Deo, and their team

04:01.875 --> 04:06.542
when they discovered silver bars
belonging to the ship.

04:06.708 --> 04:09.333
12 years later,

04:09.417 --> 04:12.333
after continuously searching
across a ten-mile debris field,

04:12.458 --> 04:14.833
they discovered
what came to be known

04:15.000 --> 04:17.625
as "the <i>Atocha's</i> Mother Lode,"

04:17.708 --> 04:21.083
comprised
of $450 million in gold,

04:21.208 --> 04:24.000
silver, emeralds and artifacts.

04:24.125 --> 04:27.875
Although Mel passed away
in 1998,

04:28.042 --> 04:31.875
his family still controls the
salvage rights to the <i>Atocha</i>

04:32.000 --> 04:33.375
and continue searching

04:33.500 --> 04:36.083
for nearly half a billion
dollars more believed

04:36.208 --> 04:38.292
to remain
at the bottom of the ocean.

04:38.375 --> 04:40.792
-Onward captain!
-Let's go!

04:45.750 --> 04:47.333
RICK:
So, we're on the boat, headed

04:47.500 --> 04:49.250
to where the dive team
is anchored out in the bay,

04:49.375 --> 04:51.000
and it's exciting, right?

04:51.125 --> 04:53.375
If you were to ask somebody,

04:53.500 --> 04:55.333
"I'm going to mention a name,

04:55.417 --> 04:58.333
and I want you to mention
a family name in Key West,"

04:58.458 --> 04:59.708
I think
people would either say

04:59.833 --> 05:02.667
"Ernest Hemingway"
or "The Fishers,"

05:02.833 --> 05:05.042
because of the legend
of the <i>Atocha.</i>

05:05.167 --> 05:06.375
MATTY:
Oh, look at that.

05:06.500 --> 05:07.958
"Mel Fisher"
is right on the boat.

05:08.083 --> 05:09.625
MARTY:
Hey!

05:09.750 --> 05:12.708
RICK: I think they are
the family here in the area.

05:12.875 --> 05:14.500
This is awesome.

05:14.583 --> 05:16.708
RICK:
So, the exciting part is
we're on a treasure hunt,

05:16.833 --> 05:19.125
and we know
how successful they've been,

05:19.250 --> 05:21.042
so the hope is
we'll find something with them.

05:21.208 --> 05:22.667
Hello there.

05:22.792 --> 05:24.375
NARRATOR: Having arrived
at the treasure salvaging vessel

05:24.542 --> 05:26.458
known the <i>Magruder,</i>

05:26.542 --> 05:29.875
Rick, Marty and Matty are
greeted by Melvin Abt,

05:30.000 --> 05:32.917
the current leader of the
family's active search team.

05:33.042 --> 05:34.458
MELVIN:
All right, well,

05:34.542 --> 05:35.792
today is the day
we're gonna find some treasure.

05:35.875 --> 05:37.333
I'll tell you that much
right now.

05:37.458 --> 05:39.042
-Fantastic.
-MATTY: Love it.
-All right.

05:39.167 --> 05:41.500
-MARTY: You're pretty sure
of that?
-Confident.

05:41.667 --> 05:44.000
I am a third-generation
treasure hunter.

05:44.083 --> 05:46.500
I have been treasure hunting
since I was 11 years old.

05:46.625 --> 05:49.417
The success of the people
who have come before me

05:49.542 --> 05:51.667
make me feel
like I have big shoes to fill.

05:51.833 --> 05:54.708
TAFFI:
Our family business
is treasure hunting.

05:54.833 --> 05:56.667
That's first and foremost.
That's what we do.

05:56.792 --> 05:59.667
We have been appointed,
uh, as the owners

05:59.792 --> 06:02.417
and custodians of this history,

06:02.542 --> 06:05.667
so it's our job to preserve it.

06:05.833 --> 06:10.000
But of course, there's still
a lot left out there.

06:10.125 --> 06:12.000
MELVIN:
Well, we've been working
this site for a little

06:12.083 --> 06:13.833
over 50 years, and

06:14.000 --> 06:16.708
we expect there's just about
as much left out there

06:16.833 --> 06:18.667
to find as we've already found.

06:18.750 --> 06:20.667
TAFFI:
My youngest son,
Melvin, is my baby.

06:20.792 --> 06:22.750
He's involved
with the museum in Sebastian

06:22.875 --> 06:25.792
as the assistant director,
he dives,

06:25.917 --> 06:27.667
he's doing coin research,

06:27.792 --> 06:31.833
and he's really learning every
avenue, uh, of the business.

06:32.000 --> 06:33.875
Has this boat been involved
in the search for a long time?

06:34.042 --> 06:35.375
So, yeah, this boat was actually

06:35.500 --> 06:36.917
on the mother lode
of the <i>Atocha.</i>

06:37.042 --> 06:38.542
-No kidding?
-Wow!

06:38.708 --> 06:41.833
What is your agreement
with the powers that be?

06:41.917 --> 06:44.667
So, what we have is
a federal admiralty claim.

06:44.792 --> 06:48.667
We own the artifacts where
they lay, where we find it.

06:48.750 --> 06:50.917
As long as we can prove
it is 1622 material,

06:51.042 --> 06:53.083
it is under
our federal admiralty claim.

06:53.208 --> 06:55.042
And is it your... 100% yours?

06:55.167 --> 06:56.667
100% ours.

06:56.750 --> 06:58.833
So, where we are is
in the middle

06:59.000 --> 07:01.708
of about a nine-mile trail
of artifacts,

07:01.875 --> 07:05.750
and, uh, they were just
working along the trail

07:05.875 --> 07:09.208
and made an excavation,
and it started raining emeralds.

07:09.333 --> 07:11.167
(laughing):
No kidding. Wow.

07:11.292 --> 07:13.375
So, we named this area
"Emerald City."

07:13.500 --> 07:14.792
NARRATOR:
Although the Fisher family

07:14.875 --> 07:18.250
has long salvaged treasure
from the <i>Atocha</i>

07:18.375 --> 07:20.083
across a debris field
that stretches

07:20.208 --> 07:21.750
for more than ten miles,

07:21.875 --> 07:24.625
their current focus is
on an area

07:24.750 --> 07:27.500
where they have found an
abundance of some of the finest

07:27.625 --> 07:30.542
and most valuable emeralds
known to exist.

07:30.667 --> 07:32.375
So far, today, Emerald City--

07:32.542 --> 07:34.417
it's produced
about five and a half pounds

07:34.542 --> 07:36.667
of dark green Colombian emeralds
from the Muzo mine.

07:36.750 --> 07:38.833
-What's that worth?
-They range.

07:38.958 --> 07:42.458
Uh, the smallest ones are
about $2,000 a karat,

07:42.583 --> 07:45.083
and the larger ones
are $30,000 a karat,

07:45.208 --> 07:47.792
depending on their quality,
class, factor and size.

07:47.917 --> 07:50.375
-All different kinds.
-How many karats in five pounds?

07:50.500 --> 07:52.208
-(Melvin laughs)
-A bunch, right?

07:52.333 --> 07:53.583
-Quite a lot.
-Yeah.

07:53.708 --> 07:54.875
Uh, the largest one
recovered, though,

07:55.042 --> 07:56.333
is about 79 karats large.

07:56.417 --> 07:59.000
-Unbelievable! Wow.
-Wow.

07:59.125 --> 08:01.250
There is literally
about $500 million,

08:01.375 --> 08:03.375
by estimates,
in emeralds alone.

08:03.500 --> 08:06.458
-And we're parked over that?
-Right over that.

08:06.542 --> 08:08.292
Wow. That's incredible.

08:08.417 --> 08:10.167
Hopefully, we find some today.

08:10.250 --> 08:11.750
Yes.

08:11.875 --> 08:13.458
I do have some maps
I'd love to show you guys.

08:13.583 --> 08:14.875
-Okay.
-Yeah, great.

08:15.000 --> 08:16.583
-After you, Matty.
-Thank you, sir.

08:16.708 --> 08:18.208
MELVIN:
We've gotten more precise

08:18.333 --> 08:19.583
with the technology
we've been using

08:19.708 --> 08:21.000
and developing over the years.

08:21.125 --> 08:22.458
A lot of our charts

08:22.542 --> 08:24.458
are hand charts still,
to this day,

08:24.542 --> 08:26.292
but that's just for redundancy.

08:26.375 --> 08:30.792
Everything is plotted in a
online GPS-coordinated database.

08:30.917 --> 08:32.375
-Good afternoon, gentlemen.
-There he is.

08:32.500 --> 08:33.333
-MATTY: Oh, Captain.
-Hey, Captain.

08:33.458 --> 08:34.917
Welcome aboard.

08:35.042 --> 08:36.625
-I'm Rick.
-I'm Tim. Tim.
-I'm Marty.

08:36.708 --> 08:38.000
-Marty. Pleasure.
-Tim.
-I'm Matty Blake.

08:38.083 --> 08:39.667
-Glad to meet you, man.
-Nice to meet you.

08:39.750 --> 08:41.792
-Welcome aboard.
-MATTY: Thank you for having us.

08:41.875 --> 08:43.500
-MELVIN: So, what
are we looking at here?
-Yeah.

08:43.625 --> 08:45.417
Right now,
what we're looking at is,

08:45.542 --> 08:48.167
down here where this is rolled
up is where the <i>Atocha</i> sank.

08:48.292 --> 08:49.667
She was intact.

08:49.792 --> 08:51.708
Second hurricane hits her.

08:51.833 --> 08:53.667
She spills over to the side.

08:53.792 --> 08:55.375
-Wait. Second hurricane?
-Second hurricane.

08:55.500 --> 08:56.833
So, it was floundering
for a long time, then?

08:56.958 --> 08:59.583
She sank completely intact
after the first storm.

08:59.708 --> 09:01.542
We know that for a fact.

09:01.667 --> 09:04.250
The vessel the <i>Santa Cruz</i>
picked up the five survivors

09:04.375 --> 09:06.542
-from her mizzenmast.
-MARTY: Mm-hmm.

09:06.708 --> 09:09.167
They attached barrels
and lines to her,

09:09.292 --> 09:12.458
they sent a diver down, he said
he couldn't break into it.

09:12.583 --> 09:15.375
All the hatches were
battened down from both sides.

09:15.500 --> 09:16.917
So, they went back to Havana,

09:17.042 --> 09:18.625
started getting
a salvage crew...

09:18.708 --> 09:20.083
The ship is literally
sitting on the bottom?

09:20.208 --> 09:21.958
-Sitting on the bottom.
-I did not know that.

09:22.083 --> 09:25.417
Two weeks later, a second
hurricane comes through.

09:25.542 --> 09:26.875
-(laughing): Geez.
-She's on the bottom.

09:27.000 --> 09:30.250
It pushes her other side
on her side, she tilted.

09:30.375 --> 09:33.583
What we dubbed "mother lode"
was that reef of silver bars,

09:33.708 --> 09:35.667
broke through the hull.

09:35.750 --> 09:39.292
Ship then lost all of its
ballast, became buoyant again.

09:39.375 --> 09:41.292
-Wow.
-And then the storm started

09:41.417 --> 09:43.000
breaking her apart
as she pushed.

09:43.125 --> 09:46.167
It started pushing the ship
forward, forward, forward.

09:46.250 --> 09:47.792
Then she snapped in two here.

09:47.875 --> 09:49.375
-The bow broke off.
-Mm.

09:49.500 --> 09:50.875
Bow started going this way.

09:51.000 --> 09:52.542
Then the midship
and sterncastle continued up

09:52.708 --> 09:55.000
into this more shallower water.

09:55.167 --> 09:57.083
Are these circles--
are these mag hits or something?

09:57.208 --> 10:00.375
Those are excavations
that we have worked

10:00.500 --> 10:01.833
by using
our prop wash deflectors.

10:01.917 --> 10:03.625
These are the artifacts.
If it's...

10:03.708 --> 10:05.875
If there's nothing in it,
there's nothing there.

10:06.042 --> 10:08.917
Silver, silver coin,
silver coin.

10:09.042 --> 10:10.542
-MATTY: Wow.
-EO stands for
"encrusted object,"

10:10.667 --> 10:12.667
it means we don't know
what it is until

10:12.750 --> 10:14.750
the lab is able to get some

10:14.875 --> 10:16.583
-of the encrustation off.
-Some of these cool ones.

10:16.708 --> 10:18.583
-Gold, gold, gold, gold.
-Oh, yeah.

10:18.708 --> 10:21.667
-Gold bars.
-MATTY: Wow, yeah.
Bar, bar, bar.

10:21.750 --> 10:24.167
We use similar maps
on Oak Island,

10:24.292 --> 10:27.167
in the Money Pit, for example,
and you see little holes,

10:27.292 --> 10:29.750
and I see a lot of colors,
and that means hits.

10:29.875 --> 10:33.000
So, what you're looking at,
basically, is a map;

10:33.125 --> 10:35.417
it's a treasure trail.
It's a treasure trail.

10:35.542 --> 10:37.000
This is the debris field

10:37.167 --> 10:38.500
and so many good colors.

10:38.625 --> 10:40.000
I'm seeing green,
I'm seeing yellows,

10:40.083 --> 10:41.375
I'm seeing red,
probably for gold.

10:41.542 --> 10:42.833
This is a good map.

10:43.000 --> 10:44.500
Captain Tim, where are we going

10:44.583 --> 10:45.667
to be today?
Where are we looking?

10:45.792 --> 10:47.417
Today, we're just going to be

10:47.542 --> 10:48.667
down here...

10:48.792 --> 10:50.500
-MARTY: Okay.
-...in virgin territory.

10:50.625 --> 10:51.917
-Yeah, that looks new.
-Let's go.

10:52.042 --> 10:53.167
Let's go. Let's get divers
in the water.

10:53.292 --> 10:54.125
-Let's do it.
-Let's go.

10:58.750 --> 11:00.375
MELVIN:
When we go out
to Emerald City,

11:00.542 --> 11:03.500
we set up a three-point
mooring system

11:03.583 --> 11:06.125
right over the area
of desired excavation.

11:06.250 --> 11:08.875
And then we send down
a team of divers to operate

11:09.000 --> 11:11.833
a 70-foot airlift
to suck up all the sand,

11:11.958 --> 11:15.750
sediment and hopefully
emeralds to bring topside,

11:15.875 --> 11:19.000
where another crew of
several crew members will be

11:19.125 --> 11:23.042
sifting through the sluice,
physically looking for emeralds.

11:30.875 --> 11:33.458
So what's the dive plan? How
many divers do you got with you?

11:33.583 --> 11:35.125
Um, so, it's just me
and one other diver.

11:35.250 --> 11:37.708
We're gonna be, uh,
just lifting up some

11:37.875 --> 11:39.875
sand for you guys
so that we can give you

11:40.000 --> 11:42.375
-some nice, nice light material
full of emeralds.
-MATTY: Love it.

11:57.208 --> 11:59.833
MATTY:
I see the captain pass me,
and he's looking

11:59.917 --> 12:02.083
off the stern of the boat.

12:03.958 --> 12:06.542
TIM:
That wind is blowing in so far.

12:06.667 --> 12:08.958
It's rough as hell out there.

12:11.083 --> 12:13.500
MATTY:
And I'm going no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, not again.

12:13.625 --> 12:14.833
Not again. Not another time

12:14.917 --> 12:16.208
where something's going
to rise up

12:16.333 --> 12:18.750
and keep treasure
out of our hands (sighs).

12:18.875 --> 12:21.792
The wind's too high.
We can't go.

12:22.833 --> 12:24.833
(wind whistling)

12:31.875 --> 12:33.667
TIM:
That wind's blowing in so far.

12:33.833 --> 12:36.000
It's rough as hell out there.

12:36.167 --> 12:38.833
NARRATOR: Off the coast
of Key West, Florida,

12:38.958 --> 12:40.833
Rick and Marty Lagina,

12:40.958 --> 12:45.083
along with Matty Blake, have
joined Melvin Abt and his team

12:45.208 --> 12:48.000
in a search for
millions of dollars in emeralds

12:48.125 --> 12:51.625
connected to the legendary
shipwreck known as the <i>Atocha.</i>

12:51.750 --> 12:54.500
TIM:
Ah, we're getting it
on the back deck.

12:54.625 --> 12:58.000
NARRATOR:
But unfortunately, their
operation has just been

12:58.083 --> 13:01.333
put in jeopardy due to
a drastic change in the weather.

13:02.958 --> 13:06.500
-Captain.
-We're calling the day.
-Calling the day?

13:06.583 --> 13:09.042
-The wind has broken at...
-Oh, no.

13:09.167 --> 13:11.083
...20 miles an hour.
If it's over 15,

13:11.208 --> 13:12.333
won't set up.

13:12.417 --> 13:15.708
It's over, it's right now
where it's blowing 25.

13:15.833 --> 13:17.792
With the dredge hose
going down to a diver at

13:17.917 --> 13:19.750
the bottom, and us rocking
the way we're doing,

13:19.875 --> 13:22.875
it's too dangerous
for someone down there.

13:23.000 --> 13:24.500
So, we're going to
have to break her down

13:24.625 --> 13:26.917
till, uh, till tomorrow.

13:29.375 --> 13:32.000
MELVIN: The waves are kicking up
and it's just gonna be

13:32.125 --> 13:35.750
rocking our 80-foot
salvage boat too hard.

13:35.875 --> 13:39.250
The air lift
is tied to the boat,

13:39.375 --> 13:43.167
so to have divers in the water
trying to maneuver the air lift,

13:43.292 --> 13:45.333
you know, they're gonna
get yanked around

13:45.417 --> 13:48.458
almost violently,
and it's just not safe.

13:48.583 --> 13:50.875
TIM:
You can't control Mother Nature.

13:51.875 --> 13:53.500
It wasn't supposed
to be like this today.

13:53.667 --> 13:55.167
Yeah, this happened fast.

13:55.333 --> 13:57.042
MARTY: We were going to hold
treasure in our hands.

13:57.167 --> 14:00.750
This is the <i>Atocha.</i>
We're literally 50 feet from it.

14:00.875 --> 14:03.250
It's just 50 feet.
It's right down there,

14:03.375 --> 14:04.708
but we can't get there.

14:04.833 --> 14:06.750
<i>J.B. Magruder</i>
calling the bowrider.

14:06.875 --> 14:08.167
We are canceling the dives

14:08.292 --> 14:12.042
today and doing transfers
over at the Marquesas.

14:12.167 --> 14:13.917
We'll be standing by
on zero-nine.

14:17.792 --> 14:20.167
Sometimes bad weather rolls in
and we can't

14:20.292 --> 14:22.458
control Mother Nature.
But, uh, I'd love to

14:22.542 --> 14:24.125
get back to Key West
and show you guys some of

14:24.250 --> 14:26.000
our finds in
our shop on Duval Street.

14:26.125 --> 14:29.333
-That'd be great.
-RICK: Melvin has invited us to

14:29.458 --> 14:33.333
the Mel Fisher treasure store,
where we will meet, uh,

14:33.417 --> 14:35.083
his mother and his uncle,

14:35.208 --> 14:39.292
and I think we are all excited
because... for two reasons.

14:39.375 --> 14:40.958
One, they are legends.

14:41.042 --> 14:43.333
The other thing is,
in our little hands--

14:43.458 --> 14:45.917
and I say this again,
referencing the island--

14:46.042 --> 14:47.958
you have to hold
the proof in your hand.

14:48.042 --> 14:49.458
The proof is in that store.

14:50.708 --> 14:53.417
Fair winds and a following sea,
gentlemen. See you tomorrow.

14:53.542 --> 14:54.583
Thank you, Captain.

14:56.917 --> 14:59.500
NARRATOR:
Later that afternoon,

14:59.625 --> 15:02.458
Melvin, along with
the Laginas and Matty, arrive

15:02.542 --> 15:06.083
at Mel Fisher's Treasures
in Key West, Florida.

15:07.875 --> 15:09.833
-Welcome back.
-Hey!
-MARTY: Hello.

15:09.958 --> 15:12.292
-I'm Marty. You must be Taffi.
-I am, I'm Taffi.

15:12.375 --> 15:13.875
-Nice to meet ya, Marty.
-Hey, Marty. Kim.

15:14.000 --> 15:16.167
-Nice to meet you.
-Pleasure.
-Gary.

15:16.333 --> 15:18.458
NARRATOR:
Established in 1992,

15:18.542 --> 15:22.458
it is one of two museums
and retail shops in Florida

15:22.542 --> 15:24.125
owned by the Fisher family,

15:24.208 --> 15:27.958
where millions of dollars' worth
of authentic discoveries from

15:28.083 --> 15:31.833
the <i>Atocha</i> are housed, and some
of which can be purchased.

15:31.917 --> 15:34.458
Treasure hunting involves,
you know,

15:34.542 --> 15:36.167
a lot of different aspects.

15:36.292 --> 15:39.875
It's not just
gold and silver coins.

15:40.042 --> 15:45.167
A lot of
the other artifacts we sell

15:45.333 --> 15:48.667
to finance
the ongoing expedition.

15:49.542 --> 15:51.500
So, let me show you
some of the emeralds.

15:51.583 --> 15:53.542
Oh, fantastic.

15:53.708 --> 15:56.750
-MARTY: Look at these guys.
-MATTY: Look at that.

15:56.875 --> 15:59.167
Wow. That's amazing.

16:00.458 --> 16:02.750
-MARTY: That's beautiful.
-KIM: You know,
when you're up there,

16:02.875 --> 16:05.000
you'll see all this white sand

16:05.167 --> 16:07.667
come sliding across the trays.

16:07.792 --> 16:09.083
And when
these emeralds come through,

16:09.208 --> 16:12.042
they just jump right out at ya.

16:12.208 --> 16:15.333
When we first found
Emerald City in 1986,

16:15.500 --> 16:18.500
I shut off the air lift
real quick

16:18.667 --> 16:21.333
and here was all these emeralds
raining down on me,

16:21.417 --> 16:24.708
and they were getting
in my hair and down my wetsuit,

16:24.833 --> 16:26.542
and I was, like, grabbing them.

16:26.708 --> 16:28.833
And I spent the rest of my dive

16:28.958 --> 16:32.292
just swimming around,
just picking up emeralds.

16:32.417 --> 16:35.625
I had such a big smile
on my face that my mask kept

16:35.750 --> 16:37.500
filling up with water.
(chuckles)

16:39.083 --> 16:40.917
The darker the green, the more

16:41.042 --> 16:42.167
-valuable the emerald.
-MATTY: Oh, really?

16:42.292 --> 16:45.208
Yeah, so you want
these dark-colored ones.

16:45.333 --> 16:47.667
The real dark ones
are the most valuable.

16:47.750 --> 16:49.167
Wow.

16:49.333 --> 16:51.167
MARTY: Okay, well,
I never would want anybody

16:51.292 --> 16:54.000
to accuse me of being all about
money, that's not me, okay,

16:54.083 --> 16:55.458
but what the hell is that one?

16:55.542 --> 17:00.083
It's very valuable, yeah.
500, 600 thousand.

17:00.208 --> 17:02.125
-Whoa! Move these away from me.
-Wow. Wow, wow.

17:02.208 --> 17:04.000
I don't wanna hurt 'em.

17:04.083 --> 17:06.125
KIM: But we're expecting
some out there

17:06.208 --> 17:09.333
-to be 2,500 karats.
-Really?

17:09.458 --> 17:13.458
-From 1620 until 1622...
-Seriously?

17:13.583 --> 17:17.125
...was a record production
for the Muzo mine.

17:17.208 --> 17:19.917
And that's the shipment
that was on board

17:20.042 --> 17:21.792
the <i>Atocha</i> going back to Spain.

17:21.917 --> 17:23.833
MARTY:
These are not just emeralds.

17:23.917 --> 17:26.167
These are
the world's best emeralds

17:26.250 --> 17:27.917
from a mine that actually became

17:28.042 --> 17:29.417
the standard for emeralds.

17:29.542 --> 17:31.667
These things are extraordinary.

17:31.750 --> 17:33.833
Taffi, you said
that the jewelry,

17:33.917 --> 17:35.500
most of the jewelry
was not on the manifest.

17:35.625 --> 17:38.125
Yeah, none of the jewelry
was on the manifest

17:38.208 --> 17:40.417
because jewelry
was not a taxable item.

17:40.542 --> 17:44.083
So, they had a lot of jewelry,
you know, gold chains.

17:44.208 --> 17:47.083
We found one gold chain
67 feet long.

17:47.208 --> 17:48.708
They actually
used them for money.

17:48.875 --> 17:50.833
They called them money chains.

17:50.958 --> 17:53.333
-MARTY: Gold is incredible,
isn't it?
-MATTY: Look at that.

17:53.500 --> 17:55.250
There's some bling
for you, buddy.

17:55.375 --> 17:56.667
-Feel that weight.
-MATTY: I've-I've seen

17:56.750 --> 17:58.875
so many of these, you know...

17:59.042 --> 18:00.958
-In pictures.
-...studying pictures.

18:01.083 --> 18:02.250
and hours of videos
of your grandfather.

18:02.375 --> 18:03.708
It's more,
it's more fun when you

18:03.833 --> 18:05.875
dribble it into their hand.

18:06.000 --> 18:07.833
Hold your hand out like this.

18:07.958 --> 18:11.083
My dad loved
to hang his gold chain

18:11.208 --> 18:13.167
-around peoples' necks.
-Wow.

18:13.292 --> 18:14.458
TAFFI:
A lot of people will say,

18:14.583 --> 18:16.667
"Oh, your father hung
his gold chain

18:16.792 --> 18:18.167
on my neck once."

18:18.292 --> 18:20.333
So, a lot of people
remember him for that.

18:21.375 --> 18:25.208
RICK: What was really impactful
was, these are not static items.

18:25.375 --> 18:26.875
They tell a story,
each and every one of them.

18:27.000 --> 18:30.333
Not only a story
of how they were acquired

18:30.417 --> 18:33.833
but how they were transported,
the events that led up to

18:33.958 --> 18:37.333
the opportunity
for Mel Fisher, Sr.

18:37.417 --> 18:40.792
to go looking for them, and now
they're telling that story.

18:42.208 --> 18:44.708
There's gotta be
a value multiplier of some sort

18:44.833 --> 18:46.333
because it's from the <i>Atocha.</i>

18:46.417 --> 18:48.875
Yeah, it's like
the <i>Atocha</i> factor is

18:49.000 --> 18:51.250
-about four times.
-MARTY: Yeah, I figured
something like that.

18:51.375 --> 18:54.500
It's been a battle since
my dad first started, you know.

18:54.583 --> 18:56.833
The government's always trying
to take it away from you.

18:56.917 --> 18:59.542
-Yes.
-I mean, our dad fought in court

18:59.708 --> 19:03.208
for years and years
because the government wanted to

19:03.333 --> 19:06.667
take the treasure away, and he
beat them, and they appealed it.

19:06.750 --> 19:09.125
And we did, like,
140 hearings or something.

19:09.250 --> 19:10.917
-111.
-111.

19:11.042 --> 19:13.583
KIM: Before we got
to the Supreme Court,

19:13.708 --> 19:16.167
and, uh, they said,
"finders keepers."

19:16.292 --> 19:18.292
-Hundred percent ownership.
-So, we got it all.

19:18.417 --> 19:20.417
If you find a coin,
you get to keep it.

19:20.542 --> 19:22.500
-Really?
-All right. Amazing.

19:22.625 --> 19:25.042
If you find a gold bar,
it's mine.

19:25.167 --> 19:27.042
-(laughter)
-MARTY: All right.

19:27.167 --> 19:29.458
KIM:
And just to give you an idea
of what that would look like,

19:29.542 --> 19:31.458
-if you are looking
for a gold bar...
-Oh, my gosh. What?

19:31.542 --> 19:33.000
Whoa.

19:33.167 --> 19:35.208
-MATTY: What?
-Other bars we've found,
you know,

19:35.333 --> 19:36.833
they drag
their finger in the sand

19:36.917 --> 19:39.375
and pour it right in there
and shove it in their boot

19:39.542 --> 19:41.333
-and smuggle it home.
-My goodness.

19:41.417 --> 19:44.250
This one has markings on it, so
we know it was registered cargo.

19:44.375 --> 19:46.542
Tomorrow we are going to find
some of these.

19:46.667 --> 19:48.417
We are going to give them to
you, but we're gonna find 'em.

19:48.542 --> 19:50.083
Anyway.
Seriously, thank you.

19:50.208 --> 19:51.667
Thanks for inviting us,
thanks for letting us

19:51.750 --> 19:53.000
get on board your boat.

19:53.125 --> 19:54.667
All I can say
is thank you for sharing

19:54.750 --> 19:56.583
-'cause it's quite remarkable.
-KIM: You're very welcome.

19:56.708 --> 19:58.208
Good luck tomorrow!

19:58.375 --> 19:59.542
-All right, good luck tomorrow.
-Tomorrow's the day!

19:59.667 --> 20:01.208
-MARTY: Buh-bye.
-KIM: See ya next time.

20:08.208 --> 20:10.042
MARTY:
There's the HMS <i>Magruder.</i>

20:10.167 --> 20:12.042
Great day for
finding some emeralds.

20:12.167 --> 20:15.208
-Yes, it is!
-MATTY: Let's go to
the Emerald City, shall we?

20:15.375 --> 20:17.583
NARRATOR:
As a new day begins
off the coast

20:17.708 --> 20:19.208
of Key West, Florida,

20:19.333 --> 20:22.000
Rick and Marty Lagina,
along with Matty Blake,

20:22.125 --> 20:25.042
join Melvin Abt and his team

20:25.167 --> 20:27.208
once again to search
for millions of dollars

20:27.375 --> 20:29.625
in emeralds connected
to the legendary

20:29.708 --> 20:32.833
Spanish galleon wreck
known as the <i>Atocha.</i>

20:32.917 --> 20:35.333
<i>-(over walkie):
Mel, you out there?</i>
-Roger that.

20:35.458 --> 20:38.250
Hear you loud and clear.

20:47.292 --> 20:48.708
MARTY:
All right!

20:48.833 --> 20:50.250
All right.
Let's get divers in the water.

20:50.375 --> 20:51.208
Let's get some emeralds,
finally!

20:51.333 --> 20:53.000
Today's the day.

20:53.125 --> 20:54.625
The weather gods are
shining on us,

20:54.708 --> 20:57.958
and I hope they don't
give us half a day.

20:58.042 --> 20:58.958
I hope they give us
the whole day.

20:59.042 --> 21:00.500
Ahoy!

21:00.583 --> 21:02.333
RICK: But everyone
is suggesting strongly

21:02.458 --> 21:04.125
that today's the day.

21:04.250 --> 21:07.375
Literally. I hope that
today's the day for us,

21:07.542 --> 21:10.167
that we can actually
do the work,

21:10.250 --> 21:12.333
that we may actually
find something.

21:12.417 --> 21:15.125
-Is this your BCD?
-Yep! It's all set up.

21:15.208 --> 21:16.708
-All ready to rock?
-Ready to go.

21:16.833 --> 21:18.500
MATTY: Right now,
divers are just about to

21:18.583 --> 21:20.167
get wet, about to
get in that water.

21:20.292 --> 21:22.875
And every one of these,
there comes a moment

21:23.042 --> 21:24.458
where it's, like, go time.

21:24.583 --> 21:26.500
Now we're treasure hunting,
and it gets real quiet

21:26.583 --> 21:28.542
and the excitement level
ratchets up.

21:28.708 --> 21:31.250
So there's, like,
a nervous, excited,

21:31.375 --> 21:33.792
palpable energy
on the boat right now.

21:33.917 --> 21:37.542
We are on the <i>Magruder.</i>
We are on the Mel Fisher boat.

21:37.667 --> 21:39.667
We are about to treasure hunt.
Weather's looking good.

21:39.750 --> 21:41.542
It's finally here.

21:41.708 --> 21:44.833
The three of us really,
firmly believe

21:44.917 --> 21:46.417
that we're going
to be holding emeralds.

21:46.542 --> 21:49.583
-We are excited.
-You got your fins, right?

21:49.708 --> 21:51.417
-Yep.
-Tanks strapped, air's on.

21:51.542 --> 21:53.250
-Your gauge looks good.
-Good to go.

21:53.375 --> 21:54.417
-All right.
-Got about 3,000 pounds.

21:54.542 --> 21:56.708
The Lagina sand sifters

21:56.875 --> 21:59.167
are ready to go,
so bring us some sand.

21:59.250 --> 22:00.917
-We get the easy part, I know.
-You got it.

22:01.042 --> 22:03.208
I'll bring up some sand
and bring up some emeralds.

22:03.333 --> 22:05.042
MARTY: Bring up some sand.
Green is the thing.

22:05.167 --> 22:07.417
-Green is what we are
looking for.
-Yep. Dark green.

22:07.542 --> 22:10.458
-Those are the valuable ones.
-We're ready when you are, bud.

22:10.583 --> 22:11.750
-Ready to do it.
-Let's go.

22:11.875 --> 22:13.417
MATTY:
Everyone good?

22:13.542 --> 22:15.458
-Ready.
-Captain, good?

22:15.583 --> 22:17.958
-All divers ready.
-Good to go!

22:19.042 --> 22:21.708
-TIM: Good hunting!
-MATTY: Diver one's in!

22:21.833 --> 22:24.500
TIM:
Diver's in!

22:24.583 --> 22:26.958
ZACH:
Good hunting, Mel.

22:27.042 --> 22:28.542
MATTY:
Diver two's in!

22:39.458 --> 22:41.750
Attention, divers.
Attention, divers.

22:41.875 --> 22:44.333
<i>We're standing by.
Good hunting.</i>

22:44.458 --> 22:47.750
MELVIN:
We have a one-way transducer
on the <i>J.B. Magruder</i> so that

22:47.875 --> 22:50.750
the captain can use a hailing
radio to speak to the divers.

22:50.875 --> 22:53.125
It's kind of like
an omnipresent voice

22:53.208 --> 22:56.042
when you're underwater 'cause
you're right under the boat

22:56.167 --> 22:58.500
or 100 feet away and you can
hear them loud and clear.

22:58.583 --> 23:03.667
-Best way to do this
is take two paddles.
-Yes. Yep.

23:03.792 --> 23:07.542
So, material comes up.
Say this is your pile.

23:07.708 --> 23:12.583
All you have to do is spread it
once or maybe twice that way.

23:13.667 --> 23:15.250
Scoop what you just
lifted back up. Mm-hmm.

23:15.375 --> 23:17.458
You can just dump
it in the wheelbarrow.

23:17.542 --> 23:19.458
If you are here, you can

23:19.583 --> 23:21.875
-dump it in this bucket.
-Okay.

23:22.042 --> 23:24.833
-I'm telling you, they are
going to pop out at ya.
-Okay.

23:24.958 --> 23:27.250
And as it's coming up,
you can see that

23:27.375 --> 23:28.708
the grates in
the screen here are much larger.

23:28.875 --> 23:31.833
-Yeah.
-So, it's where it catches

23:31.917 --> 23:34.833
all this broken shell,
seashells, sharks' teeth.

23:35.000 --> 23:37.625
For an emerald to get hung
up here, it would have to be...

23:37.708 --> 23:40.292
-A good one.
-...at least ten karats.

23:40.417 --> 23:42.542
But silver coins
can get popped up.

23:42.708 --> 23:44.708
We have recovered
a silver coin in the near area

23:44.833 --> 23:47.667
and then as it flows down,
becomes a tighter screen.

23:47.792 --> 23:49.417
It flows down a tighter screen.

23:49.542 --> 23:51.333
So, the colors
that we are looking for

23:51.458 --> 23:52.667
is of course the dark green,

23:52.792 --> 23:55.250
the dark Muzo mine emeralds.

23:55.375 --> 23:57.750
They pop out real easy

23:57.875 --> 24:00.542
-against this you know,
dull-colored sand.
-Sure.

24:00.667 --> 24:02.458
But the other colors
that you want to look out for

24:02.542 --> 24:04.708
is silver coins kinda
look like half an Oreo cookie.

24:04.875 --> 24:07.458
They have uh,
the silver oxide on them.

24:07.583 --> 24:10.167
Gold, of course,
gold lusters just as brilliantly

24:10.292 --> 24:12.333
-as it did when it went down.
-Yep.

24:12.458 --> 24:16.167
So, the colors are green,
black and gold.

24:17.708 --> 24:20.042
-Sounds like a sporting team.
-(Matty chuckles)

24:20.167 --> 24:22.458
MELVEN:
We work a pretty methodical
search pattern

24:22.583 --> 24:24.458
when we're using
the air lift.

24:24.542 --> 24:28.958
We try to clear squares
in five foot by five foot areas.

24:29.042 --> 24:31.542
That way we can mark
them off on our charts

24:31.708 --> 24:35.167
and positively say that
we have searched this area.

24:35.292 --> 24:37.750
How deep will they go?

24:37.875 --> 24:40.833
TIM: Uh, they'll go until they
hit the hard-packed mud bottom.

24:40.917 --> 24:45.833
There's a lot of overburden
over top of the wreck.

24:45.917 --> 24:48.625
Sand, shell, mud.

24:51.125 --> 24:53.542
It's a lot to move.

24:53.708 --> 24:56.667
Yes, I wanna see these
beautiful, priceless emeralds.

24:56.750 --> 24:58.667
Those belong
to the Fisher family.

24:58.833 --> 25:01.750
I was told by Kim Fisher,
that if we find a coin,

25:01.875 --> 25:03.833
if I find a coin,
I get to keep it.

25:03.917 --> 25:05.667
Now, not that
that would be so valuable,

25:05.750 --> 25:08.750
but I would've found it
and I get to keep it.

25:08.875 --> 25:11.000
And so, I am actually
almost more excited,

25:11.167 --> 25:12.708
as bad as that sounds,

25:12.875 --> 25:14.500
I'm almost more excited to find

25:14.667 --> 25:16.417
a coin of my own
than I am emeralds,

25:16.542 --> 25:17.958
but we are going
to go after everything.

25:18.083 --> 25:19.792
And anything could come
across that table.

25:19.875 --> 25:22.500
We're in the debris field
of the <i>Atocha.</i>

25:31.083 --> 25:33.375
Hey, we're treasure hunting,
fellas.

25:33.500 --> 25:34.833
MARTY:
By God we are.

25:34.958 --> 25:37.083
RICK: Right now,
the apparatus is running,

25:37.208 --> 25:40.833
the water's coming down the belt
and, you know, we're all

25:40.958 --> 25:42.875
intently focused on
what we're supposed to do.

25:43.042 --> 25:44.333
Bring it on!

25:44.417 --> 25:47.333
Come on, baby!
Bring me some green!

25:47.458 --> 25:52.375
The problem that I'm finding
is the shells are colorful,

25:52.542 --> 25:55.083
they're brilliant,
they're all different shapes

25:55.208 --> 25:58.750
and sizes. (chuckles)
So I'm constantly focused on,

25:58.875 --> 26:00.708
okay, stay in the moment,
you're looking for emeralds.

26:00.833 --> 26:02.917
But I have a task
in front of me.

26:03.042 --> 26:07.458
We all do. And that is to find
the color green on that mesh.

26:07.542 --> 26:10.125
And I am dedicated
to that task, and I will

26:10.208 --> 26:11.417
let nothing get in the way.

26:11.542 --> 26:12.500
How are you doing
down there, Matty?

26:12.625 --> 26:15.167
We're doing fantastic,

26:15.250 --> 26:17.667
but I am ready for some green.

26:23.042 --> 26:25.750
Okay, materials
coming up nicely.

26:26.875 --> 26:28.667
Will this air lift
bring up gold?

26:28.792 --> 26:30.667
'Cause gold is really dense.

26:30.833 --> 26:32.542
It would depend
on the size of it.

26:32.667 --> 26:34.667
A gold coin, absolutely.

26:35.708 --> 26:37.792
Gold jewelry, absolutely.

26:38.958 --> 26:40.208
What's that?

26:44.375 --> 26:45.792
Is that just a rock?

26:49.833 --> 26:53.333
No, that is not.
That's beautiful!

26:57.708 --> 26:58.958
MARTY:
What's that?

27:00.125 --> 27:01.125
Is that just a rock?

27:05.542 --> 27:07.458
No, that is not.

27:07.583 --> 27:09.583
That's actually iron
from the wreck.

27:09.708 --> 27:10.833
-Is it really?
-It is.

27:10.958 --> 27:12.375
NARRATOR:
Nearly 40 miles

27:12.542 --> 27:14.125
off the coast
of Key West, Florida,

27:14.208 --> 27:18.208
Marty Lagina has just
made a discovery believed to be

27:18.333 --> 27:20.375
connected to the <i>Atocha,</i>

27:20.500 --> 27:22.042
the legendary Spanish
treasure galleon

27:22.167 --> 27:24.500
that sank more
than four centuries ago.

27:24.667 --> 27:26.583
TIM: You see how it's
slightly oxidizing there?

27:27.667 --> 27:31.042
I thought it might be silver,
but is it iron?

27:31.208 --> 27:33.125
-It's iron.
-MATTY: Would that be from
the wreck?

27:33.250 --> 27:35.042
TIM:
Good chance of it.

27:35.208 --> 27:38.083
All right, I found something.
I found a piece of the <i>Atocha.</i>

27:38.208 --> 27:39.542
-Maybe.
-Yeah.

27:39.708 --> 27:41.583
Shows we're in the right place,
if it is.

27:41.708 --> 27:45.875
-MARTY: That's a good sign,
right?
-Any start is a good start.

27:47.792 --> 27:49.208
It's just a rock.

27:50.958 --> 27:52.833
RICK:
I have spent countless hours

27:52.958 --> 27:54.583
on the wash plant conveyor

27:54.708 --> 27:57.792
on Oak Island,
and I know it's tedious.

27:57.917 --> 27:59.958
I know it's somewhat boring.

28:00.042 --> 28:03.167
This is a little bit
different because we know

28:03.250 --> 28:04.792
exactly what to focus on.

28:04.917 --> 28:07.333
We're looking for green,
we're looking for emeralds,

28:07.500 --> 28:10.833
and we're hopeful.

28:11.000 --> 28:14.167
As Mel told us,
generally they find things.

28:14.292 --> 28:16.167
So, it should be exciting.

28:18.167 --> 28:20.000
MELVIN: When I'm swimming
around the hole, I'm looking

28:20.125 --> 28:23.083
for anything
that doesn't look natural.

28:23.208 --> 28:27.083
I'm looking for man-made
objects, encrusted artifacts.

28:28.417 --> 28:31.500
Most people will swim
right over an artifact.

28:31.625 --> 28:34.625
They're just not really trained
to look for an encrusted object.

28:34.708 --> 28:36.000
You know, they're expecting

28:36.167 --> 28:38.167
everything they find
to be shiny gold.

28:39.208 --> 28:41.917
You know it reminds me
a little bit, again,

28:42.042 --> 28:46.375
of when I was on the other
side of Florida doing the 1715

28:46.500 --> 28:48.917
Spanish Treasure Fleet and we
pulled up parts of the ship.

28:49.042 --> 28:52.250
You know, like, that
is incredible history. It's...

28:52.375 --> 28:55.000
it's not gold, but it's-- You're
holding something in your hands

28:55.083 --> 28:57.500
that's been under there for 300
or, in this case, 400 years.

28:57.625 --> 28:59.333
400 years.
And to know it definitively.

28:59.458 --> 29:01.375
-Yes!
-RICK: Well, you heard
the captain say

29:01.500 --> 29:02.542
this is from the <i>Atocha.</i>

29:02.708 --> 29:04.000
So, it's at least 400.

29:04.167 --> 29:06.750
-Could be older.
-That's crazy.

29:06.875 --> 29:10.500
MELVIN:
Every artifact we recover tells
a little bit more of the story.

29:10.667 --> 29:11.917
It's like another piece
of the puzzle

29:12.042 --> 29:13.875
of the <i>Atocha</i> shipwreck.

29:15.375 --> 29:17.000
What we're looking at
is a scatter pattern

29:17.167 --> 29:20.250
of artifacts
over nine miles long,

29:20.375 --> 29:23.000
so every time we find another
piece of the puzzle, we mark it.

29:23.083 --> 29:24.750
What it is,
where we found it,

29:24.875 --> 29:27.167
how deep in the mud it was,
et cetera.

29:27.292 --> 29:31.500
After two minutes of water,
rev twice for dredge shutoff.

29:31.625 --> 29:33.458
After two minutes of water,

29:33.542 --> 29:34.792
<i>rev twice for shutoff.</i>

29:34.917 --> 29:36.417
<i>We're standing by.</i>

29:46.375 --> 29:49.167
<i>(over comms): All right,
first pump done.</i>

29:49.292 --> 29:52.833
NARRATOR:
After operating the air lift
for more than an hour,

29:52.958 --> 29:56.625
Melvin Abt and Jacob Bell
must now surface

29:56.708 --> 29:58.333
in order to rest
before their next dive.

29:58.458 --> 29:59.917
I've got your tank.

30:02.208 --> 30:05.958
-MELVIN: Whew.
-(chuckles) Well said.

30:06.042 --> 30:07.542
NARRATOR:
They also have their own
discoveries

30:07.708 --> 30:10.083
to share with the team.

30:10.208 --> 30:11.833
TIM: I saw something
in your hand, man!

30:11.958 --> 30:13.125
Something in my hand.
Something in my pocket.

30:13.250 --> 30:16.417
-Oh!
-What do you got, Mel?

30:16.542 --> 30:19.542
-I got a little
piece of a ballast stone.
-MATTY: Oh, wow.

30:19.667 --> 30:23.833
NARRATOR:
Ballast stones
were stones of various sizes

30:24.000 --> 30:25.917
used to weigh down
and offer stability

30:26.042 --> 30:28.750
for galleon ships as
they traversed the seas.

30:28.875 --> 30:32.167
According to the official
manifest of the <i>Atocha,</i>

30:32.333 --> 30:35.167
because it was transporting
so much treasure,

30:35.250 --> 30:37.042
some of the valuables
were actually

30:37.167 --> 30:39.958
intermingled with
layers of the ballast.

30:41.375 --> 30:43.208
That's definitely
a piece of ballast.

30:43.375 --> 30:45.833
-Why do you say that?
-Yeah, how are you sure?
-Ballast stone?

30:45.917 --> 30:48.333
Well, out here in the ocean,
the bottom is

30:48.417 --> 30:50.500
pretty much going to be
coral limestone.

30:50.625 --> 30:53.083
This is quarried stone
from Cuba.

30:53.208 --> 30:55.208
You can tell by looking at it.

30:55.333 --> 30:57.875
It's got a high--
You'll see quartz veins in it.

30:58.000 --> 31:00.083
And then there's also
Cuban river rock.

31:00.208 --> 31:01.250
-MARTY: Look at that piece.
-TIM: What do you got there?

31:01.375 --> 31:03.958
So, this one
is a barrel hoop fragment,

31:04.042 --> 31:07.250
-I believe.
-That is a barrel hoop fragment.

31:07.375 --> 31:09.833
Once again, from the iron in it,
we got the rust stain.

31:10.000 --> 31:11.375
Looking good.

31:11.542 --> 31:13.500
NARRATOR: A piece
of an iron barrel hoop,

31:13.583 --> 31:15.000
potentially from the <i>Atocha?</i>

31:16.500 --> 31:20.667
Generally composed of iron
or heavy steel, barrel hoops

31:20.792 --> 31:25.125
are the metal rings that hold
wooden cargo containers intact.

31:25.208 --> 31:28.875
The question is, just what
was stored in the barrel

31:29.042 --> 31:30.958
that this artifact came from?

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
So, we've got ballast,
which we know that are in

31:34.167 --> 31:35.417
the lowest portion of the ship.

31:36.458 --> 31:38.917
Barrel hoops are going
to be stored in

31:39.042 --> 31:40.083
the lowest portion of the ship.

31:40.208 --> 31:42.000
And there's nothing to say

31:42.083 --> 31:44.000
that the container of emeralds
was not kept in a barrel.

31:44.083 --> 31:46.208
Wow. That's amazing.

31:46.375 --> 31:47.833
The more you find,
the more questions there are.

31:47.958 --> 31:49.333
And the more questions,
the more you look for.

31:49.417 --> 31:51.708
And the more you look for,
the more you find.

31:51.833 --> 31:53.250
There has been a suggestion,

31:53.375 --> 31:56.000
a strong suggestion,
based upon these museums

31:56.125 --> 32:00.250
and archives that you
put treasure in barrels.

32:00.375 --> 32:04.125
So, it's very possible that
this very hoop we are looking at

32:04.250 --> 32:07.458
might've held
emerald contents of a barrel.

32:07.542 --> 32:09.500
-All right, want to do
another one?
-I'm ready.

32:09.583 --> 32:12.208
We got daylight a-wasting, let's
get the next diver in the water.

32:12.333 --> 32:13.417
-Let's do it.
-Let's go!

32:19.708 --> 32:21.500
-MATTY: You ready
to head back in?
-Ready to head back in.

32:21.625 --> 32:22.917
So, you had enough time
on the surface, right?

32:23.042 --> 32:24.000
Yep. Just enough.

32:24.167 --> 32:25.458
-Hey, Zach.
-Sir.

32:25.542 --> 32:26.667
-MATTY: You ready to go?
-Oh, yeah. Absolutely!

32:26.792 --> 32:28.958
Let's go bring up some treasure.

32:29.042 --> 32:31.042
Yeah, let's keep
the ball rolling, huh.

32:31.208 --> 32:34.167
-Let's go! Today's the day!
-MARTY: In the water.

32:34.292 --> 32:38.208
NARRATOR:
After discovering evidence of
the acclaimed <i>Atocha</i> shipwreck

32:38.333 --> 32:41.250
off the coast
of Key West, Florida,

32:41.375 --> 32:45.083
treasure hunter Melvin Abt
is now joined by fellow diver

32:45.208 --> 32:48.625
Zach Moore to make a descent
some 50 feet below

32:48.708 --> 32:52.167
in search of millions
of dollars in emeralds known

32:52.292 --> 32:56.583
to have been on the ship
when it sank in 1622.

32:56.708 --> 32:57.625
Good to go?

32:59.625 --> 33:02.125
-Good hunting!
-MATTY: There they go.

33:02.208 --> 33:04.083
-TIM: Divers down!
-MARTY: Divers down.

33:04.208 --> 33:07.958
-I got a good feeling
about this, Matty Blake.
-Yeah, me, too.

33:08.042 --> 33:10.917
NARRATOR:
Although emeralds can only
be detected by sight,

33:11.042 --> 33:12.250
for this dive,

33:12.375 --> 33:15.458
Melvin is using
a handheld metal detector

33:15.542 --> 33:19.167
to also look for the vast
amount of silver and gold

33:19.292 --> 33:22.375
that is yet to be recovered from
the debris field of the wreck.

33:25.208 --> 33:27.500
-All right, this is exciting!
-Yeah, it is.

33:27.667 --> 33:30.125
Anything can come up,
and we're sending down very

33:30.208 --> 33:31.958
qualified people
with a metal detector.

33:32.042 --> 33:34.583
We're, we're up on top
with bated breath.

33:34.708 --> 33:36.750
-Now we wait.
-Now we wait.

33:38.792 --> 33:40.917
MELVIN:
Sometimes, we will have a diver
search the area

33:41.042 --> 33:43.292
with a metal detector.

33:43.375 --> 33:45.500
We like to be very thorough
in our search,

33:45.625 --> 33:48.167
and sometimes we find objects
that aren't even metallic--

33:48.333 --> 33:50.958
uh, pottery shards,
pottery necks,

33:51.083 --> 33:53.042
all different kinds
of other artifacts.

33:56.000 --> 33:59.000
Attention, divers.
Attention, divers.

33:59.167 --> 34:01.000
<i>Try to wrap everything up</i>

34:01.083 --> 34:02.708
<i>and return to topside</i>

34:02.833 --> 34:04.500
in about ten minutes.

34:04.625 --> 34:06.958
Try to wrap everything up
and return to topside

34:07.083 --> 34:10.167
in about ten minutes.
Standing by.

34:10.292 --> 34:13.167
NARRATOR:
After searching
for nearly a half hour,

34:13.292 --> 34:16.167
every second now counts
for the team to make

34:16.292 --> 34:18.708
an important
or valuable discovery.

34:37.625 --> 34:40.375
MELVIN:
It's extremely exciting
to find an intact

34:40.500 --> 34:42.750
artifact for
the first time in 400 years.

34:42.875 --> 34:46.750
It's just unlike anything else
to bring up a piece of history.

34:46.875 --> 34:49.583
<i>TIM (over comms):
All right, guys,
go ahead and wrap your dive up.</i>

34:49.708 --> 34:52.958
Finish your safety stops
and come up to the surface.

34:53.042 --> 34:55.375
Wrap your dive up,
finish your safety stop,

34:55.542 --> 34:58.083
come to the surface.
Standing by.

35:01.542 --> 35:03.750
Whenever the divers
come out of the water,

35:03.875 --> 35:05.917
it's almost like
that hammer grab coming out

35:06.042 --> 35:07.500
of the hole
on Oak Island, you know?

35:07.625 --> 35:10.083
It's like, what is in it?
What's in their pockets?

35:10.208 --> 35:11.750
There's a lot of
excitement in the air.

35:11.875 --> 35:13.917
Got bubbles.

35:14.042 --> 35:17.208
NARRATOR:
After pausing underwater
for several minutes

35:17.333 --> 35:19.417
to decompress
before their ascent,

35:19.542 --> 35:22.792
Melvin and Zach now return
to the surface

35:22.917 --> 35:25.792
to share what they have found
with the rest of the team.

35:30.708 --> 35:31.625
MARTY:
Divers are up.

35:32.708 --> 35:35.208
Well, Matty, what's your bet,
what'd they find?

35:35.375 --> 35:37.375
-I think our hot hand
got something.
-He got something?

35:37.500 --> 35:39.208
Oh, yeah! We definitely
have something.

35:39.333 --> 35:40.583
What do you got?

35:47.542 --> 35:49.792
(all exclaim)

35:49.875 --> 35:52.042
MARTY:
Oh, that's cool.

35:52.208 --> 35:54.208
The second I see
this olive jar neck,

35:54.375 --> 35:56.708
I am thrilled because

35:56.875 --> 35:58.250
I'm telling you,

35:58.375 --> 36:00.167
right that second,
I knew this thing was old.

36:00.292 --> 36:01.333
Oh, check it out,
you can actually see some pitch

36:01.458 --> 36:03.667
still on it; see right here?

36:04.792 --> 36:06.792
MATTY:
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
That's pitch.

36:06.917 --> 36:09.417
-Yeah.
-MATTY: That's pitch from
the original...

36:09.542 --> 36:10.833
TIM: From the original
contents of it.

36:10.917 --> 36:12.917
MATTY:
Holy moly.

36:13.042 --> 36:15.333
NARRATOR:
Generally made of quartz,
and originally designed

36:15.458 --> 36:17.333
to store olive oil,

36:17.458 --> 36:20.625
so-called "olive jars"
were utilized on

36:20.750 --> 36:23.917
16th- and 17th-century
Spanish treasure galleons

36:24.042 --> 36:27.708
for the transport of different
types of wet and dry goods.

36:28.833 --> 36:31.292
Although they are not made
of precious metals,

36:31.375 --> 36:33.250
because of their
delicate nature,

36:33.375 --> 36:35.500
even fragments are rare,

36:35.625 --> 36:37.667
and quite valuable discoveries

36:37.792 --> 36:40.625
for treasure hunters
and archaeologists alike.

36:40.750 --> 36:43.792
MELVIN:
The pottery itself tells
a very interesting story.

36:43.917 --> 36:48.167
This was a 150-foot,
40-ton Spanish galleon

36:48.250 --> 36:52.625
and to find
an intact neck of pottery after

36:52.708 --> 36:56.833
it survived that and 400 years
of tumbling around the ocean,

36:57.000 --> 36:59.625
to find an intact piece
of pottery is pretty amazing.

36:59.708 --> 37:02.625
Did you see it first
with your twin-optical scanner,

37:02.708 --> 37:05.625
as Gary Drayton likes to say,
or did you feel it?

37:05.708 --> 37:07.583
-That's a nice find.
-It was mostly buried.

37:07.708 --> 37:09.458
There was what? About a what,
a little corner of it...

37:09.542 --> 37:10.958
-MELVIN: Yeah,
sticking out of the sand.
-Yeah, a quarter of

37:11.083 --> 37:12.333
it sticking out of the sand.

37:12.417 --> 37:14.375
-TIM: Sand or mud?
-It was right in the mud.

37:14.500 --> 37:16.333
Mixture of sand
and mud, right

37:16.458 --> 37:18.208
-at the crease of the hole.
-It's found in the mud.

37:18.375 --> 37:19.625
So the fact that it was

37:19.708 --> 37:20.917
in the mud means
it's been living there

37:21.042 --> 37:22.833
for almost 400 years.

37:22.958 --> 37:26.042
There is 100% chance that came
from the <i>Atocha,</i> correct?

37:26.167 --> 37:27.917
Hundred percent.

37:35.625 --> 37:37.500
MARTY:
There is a 100% chance

37:37.625 --> 37:40.083
that came from
the <i>Atocha,</i> correct?

37:40.208 --> 37:41.375
-Hundred percent.
-That's what I thought.

37:41.500 --> 37:43.000
A hundred percent.
There's no doubt.

37:43.167 --> 37:44.792
-RICK: That's pretty amazing.
-MATTY: That's amazing.

37:44.875 --> 37:47.750
NARRATOR: While searching in
some 50 feet of water

37:47.875 --> 37:49.667
near Key West, Florida,

37:49.750 --> 37:51.917
divers Melvin Abt and Zach Moore

37:52.042 --> 37:53.833
have just discovered a rare

37:53.958 --> 37:56.500
and valuable piece
of olive jar pottery

37:56.625 --> 38:00.000
connected to
the legendary <i>Atocha</i> shipwreck.

38:00.167 --> 38:01.167
MATTY:
How rare is this?

38:01.292 --> 38:02.958
Well, the rarity
of this artifact

38:03.042 --> 38:05.542
is significant because
the <i>Atocha</i> was known--

38:05.708 --> 38:07.333
It was carrying silver coins,

38:07.417 --> 38:10.958
so there are thousands
of silver coins on it.

38:11.042 --> 38:13.042
There were kegs
of musket balls,

38:13.208 --> 38:14.333
there were thousands of that.

38:14.500 --> 38:15.625
But there were only
a few hundred

38:15.750 --> 38:18.167
-amphoras that were on it.
-Right.

38:18.250 --> 38:20.375
MARTY:
Captain Tim is very excited

38:20.542 --> 38:22.667
about this
olive jar pottery top

38:22.833 --> 38:24.667
because there weren't very many.
That makes it a rare find.

38:24.792 --> 38:26.500
It is considered to be
right up there with

38:26.625 --> 38:28.333
silver, gold and jewels.

38:28.458 --> 38:29.583
Now where will this go?
This will obviously--

38:29.708 --> 38:31.500
-MARTY: Bag it and tag it.
-Short-term,

38:31.583 --> 38:33.167
-go in there, in the water.
-Bag and tag it.

38:33.250 --> 38:35.375
RICK: This is certainly
from the <i>Atocha,</i>

38:35.500 --> 38:39.958
and therefore it has to be
at least 400 years old.

38:40.083 --> 38:42.208
If that doesn't get your
attention as a treasure hunter,

38:42.333 --> 38:43.833
then you should
leave the business.

38:43.917 --> 38:46.125
-Any more diving today?
-Diving is done for the day.

38:46.250 --> 38:48.583
All of my guys are really
high up on their nitrogen count.

38:48.708 --> 38:50.542
Well, you're done for here,
this is too deep, right,

38:50.708 --> 38:52.250
-to do any more diving? Yeah.
-TIM: Right.

38:52.375 --> 38:55.708
-Copy that.
-So we'll disconnect.

38:55.833 --> 38:58.000
Oh, it was, it was really cool.

38:58.125 --> 39:00.542
Very informative, to see

39:00.708 --> 39:03.208
how you actually do
stuff was really neat.

39:03.333 --> 39:04.583
MELVIN: And we did get
some artifacts today.

39:04.708 --> 39:06.708
TIM: We got some
great artifacts today.

39:06.875 --> 39:08.833
This trip with Rick
and Marty was amazing.

39:09.000 --> 39:11.292
Even though we didn't find
emeralds, I think, you know,

39:11.375 --> 39:13.667
we accomplished what
we were out there to do;

39:13.792 --> 39:16.958
recover some artifacts and,
you know, continue the hunt.

39:17.042 --> 39:21.125
I mean, we found barrel hoops
from the wreck that haven't been

39:21.250 --> 39:23.500
seen by a human in 400 years,
and that olive jar neck

39:23.667 --> 39:26.000
is a beautiful,
beautiful piece of history.

39:26.083 --> 39:29.583
We might not have recovered
emeralds, what we were actually

39:29.708 --> 39:31.833
hoping to recover,
but that's okay.

39:31.917 --> 39:34.875
RICK: I think it's just like
with Oak Island, it wasn't what

39:35.000 --> 39:38.958
we started looking for, but it's
treasure of a different kind.

39:39.083 --> 39:41.958
It's still treasure.
It still tells a story.

39:42.083 --> 39:43.667
It still might be impactful.

39:43.792 --> 39:47.833
And I think that something might
give them some real clues about

39:48.000 --> 39:51.083
where that debris field goes,
in terms of the search.

39:51.208 --> 39:52.875
That's the area of search now,

39:53.042 --> 39:55.417
so I think they're gonna make
some tremendous finds.

39:55.542 --> 39:59.167
We've got a lot of pieces
to the puzzle filled in.

39:59.333 --> 40:00.792
We know that
we're in a good area,

40:00.917 --> 40:03.083
we just gotta keep working it
and doing what we do,

40:03.208 --> 40:04.625
not leaving any stone unturned.

40:04.708 --> 40:07.500
-You're in the right place.
-Absolutely.

40:07.625 --> 40:11.792
Every day is the day, right?
No matter what you find.

40:11.875 --> 40:15.958
Every day is the day,
and you guys exemplify that.

40:16.083 --> 40:17.750
-So, my hat's off to you.
-Well, thank you very much.

40:17.875 --> 40:19.500
RICK:
The dedication you see
exemplified here

40:19.625 --> 40:21.333
is something to be

40:21.417 --> 40:23.583
-respected and admired.
-Thank you.

40:23.708 --> 40:25.417
Well, I think
it's time to head home.

40:25.542 --> 40:27.125
We'll get the chase boat
pulled up

40:27.208 --> 40:29.000
and, uh, get you guys on board.

40:29.125 --> 40:31.917
-Mel, that sounds great.
-RICK: It's always about
the people.

40:32.042 --> 40:35.292
You know, you can find
enormous treasure,

40:35.375 --> 40:38.500
but at the end of the day, it
always comes down to the people

40:38.583 --> 40:41.000
that you meet, and we have met
some incredible people,

40:41.125 --> 40:43.417
and the Fishers
are some of those people.

40:44.750 --> 40:48.792
KIM: Growing up
and witnessing my dad's

40:48.917 --> 40:53.125
eternal optimism, it just,
it had to rub off on me.

40:53.208 --> 40:56.500
It was his perseverance,
you know,

40:56.625 --> 40:59.667
his "stick-to-it-iveness."
(laughs)

40:59.833 --> 41:03.667
TAFFI:
He encouraged people
to take on tasks

41:03.792 --> 41:05.708
that they didn't think
they were capable of.

41:05.833 --> 41:08.833
He gave people faith
in themselves

41:08.958 --> 41:11.042
that they didn't know they had.

41:12.625 --> 41:16.208
We didn't find any emeralds,
but they're going to.

41:16.333 --> 41:18.083
-I'm convinced of it.
-Yeah.

41:18.208 --> 41:20.500
RICK: If you want something
bad enough, you don't give up.

41:20.625 --> 41:23.667
I just find them inspirational
as a family unit.

41:23.792 --> 41:25.625
They have done well,
they'll continue to do well,

41:25.750 --> 41:28.375
-and it was fun being
a part of it.
-It sure was.

41:28.500 --> 41:31.208
MELVIN:
It's not if we find it,
it's when we find it.

41:31.333 --> 41:33.208
You have to be that optimistic.

41:33.333 --> 41:34.833
You have to have
the optimism that

41:34.958 --> 41:36.958
every hole will
have millions of treasure in it.

41:37.042 --> 41:39.583
The hunt goes on. I'm going
to continue searching,

41:39.708 --> 41:42.833
just helping any way I can to
make sure this legacy continues.

41:43.000 --> 41:45.667
I say we pull on in
and on to the next one.

41:45.750 --> 41:48.083
There are more
adventures out there.

41:48.208 --> 41:50.583
-On to the next, Captain!
-Fire them up, Captain.

41:50.708 --> 41:53.125
-Let's go!
-MELVIN: Today's the day.

41:53.208 --> 41:56.250
Tomorrow's the day, and the next
day's the day, and we're going

41:56.375 --> 41:58.833
to finish the job and find the
rest of the <i>Atocha</i> treasure,

41:58.917 --> 42:00.833
which is what my grandfather
would have wanted.
