06:58.319 --> 07:00.000
that's the part

07:00.000 --> 07:01.310
yeah

07:01.310 --> 07:07.220
yeah JD general probably released by the
end of the day but they want to keep

07:07.220 --> 07:10.250
Zach a little while longer a zero
doesn't look good if it's permanently

07:10.250 --> 07:12.230
damage losses certification

07:12.230 --> 07:16.160
after what I saw today that kid is all
lifeguard if he loses that I don't know

07:16.160 --> 07:17.450
what we'll do

07:17.449 --> 07:21.529
chalk up another bonehead move that
Jenna habit look JD let's not play the

07:21.529 --> 07:24.589
blame game all right Sean it's the truth

07:24.589 --> 07:28.129
I know but it doesn't help anyway thanks
for holding down the fort on your day

07:28.129 --> 07:30.620
off i push it back soon

07:30.620 --> 07:35.060
never heard what happened out there
today

07:35.060 --> 07:38.870
it looks like everyone else especially
councilman McKenna

07:38.870 --> 07:42.110
Kim said he's using the incident to
finally pull your funding and lease

07:42.110 --> 07:46.639
she also said that McKenna got to work
fast before the emergency services finds

07:46.639 --> 07:48.589
out that general assault as a lifeguard

07:48.589 --> 07:54.679
she has been recertified so I should
throw her to the wolves to save my own

07:54.680 --> 07:55.730
hide from a cannon

07:55.730 --> 08:00.080
it's either you or her and you're the
good guy

08:00.800 --> 08:04.910
no no not if I hide behind that now with
all the politics

08:04.910 --> 08:08.150
everyone's forgotten this all happened
because someone out there is calling and

08:08.149 --> 08:11.419
false alarms and I bet that same someone
is the one who took the channel marker

08:11.420 --> 08:14.360
and that's why I'm going after politics
be damned

08:14.360 --> 08:16.590
thanks for the info i'll check in later

daughters one if you and my father
really appreciate each other

08:42.240 --> 08:47.519

father so about the sake forget it

14:57.289 --> 15:00.559
Candace calling a special session early
next week

15:00.559 --> 15:03.649
what is the rush in there be an
investigation look Jenna already told

15:03.649 --> 15:07.610
you that some chemists cough but from a
PR standpoint the sooner the better for

15:07.610 --> 15:08.930
going to get rid of my grown

15:08.929 --> 15:13.309
the news is fresh and we got to spin
Captain ro recklessly put McKenna's

15:13.309 --> 15:16.879
liaison and an innocent training in
mortal danger on another wild-goose

15:16.879 --> 15:20.870
rescue someone is coming in those false
alarm right but that's not our problem

15:20.870 --> 15:21.828
is it

15:21.828 --> 15:26.088
the opportunity is to remove a watchful
eye and when we do you can do whatever

15:26.089 --> 15:28.010
you want with the assets

15:28.009 --> 15:31.639
ok what is making you want from me you
just are witness babe

15:31.639 --> 15:35.689
front and center the special session you
tell the City Council how captain Monroe

15:35.690 --> 15:38.600
nearly killed both you and that innocent
training

15:38.600 --> 15:42.950
let's say there's gotta be a better way
I would be flat-out lying and there's

15:42.950 --> 15:44.450
too many holes in my story

15:44.450 --> 15:47.778
well to quote the good councilman if she
doesn't cooperate

15:48.470 --> 15:49.470
the whole island one

15:49.470 --> 15:53.639
no she was out on a rescue without a
certification oh come on that was an

15:53.639 --> 15:54.960
oversight that's all

15:54.960 --> 15:58.019
an oversight will shove right down your
throat

15:58.019 --> 16:01.439
look if you're lucky mineral screw up
again before the session and making it

16:01.440 --> 16:06.810
easier for you but it's still going to
be your show Aloha general

16:13.429 --> 16:16.639
you know that the city council can meet
anytime they want right

16:16.639 --> 16:20.330
they can call anyone in the world but
don't think I'm interested in those who

16:20.330 --> 16:23.778
owns the pickup truck whatever that is
responsible to what went on there

16:23.778 --> 16:29.838
regardless of what Jennifer I got my
guiding all over while the clearest

16:29.839 --> 16:33.380
thing in that picture the channel marker
truck will be any male model

16:33.379 --> 16:39.950
yeah I know the cops think that it was
some local kids on Frank's a you ever a

16:39.950 --> 16:45.770
20 francs when your kid a couple of
times for the butcher a nasty dead pigs

16:45.769 --> 16:46.730
feet

16:46.730 --> 16:49.879
quick where you better put shoes on and
no one will notice

16:49.879 --> 16:54.259
yeah grandma take my blood put into that
I'm sure she did

16:54.259 --> 16:56.019
see that's the thing

16:56.019 --> 17:02.110
kids teenagers they get bored they don't
want to get caught but these calls have

17:02.110 --> 17:05.588
been going on for a month and getting
more elaborate each time i checked the

17:05.588 --> 17:10.838
reports each one's more site-specific
more dangerous and then the channel

17:10.838 --> 17:11.928
marker

17:11.929 --> 17:18.259
you miss that car and get the required
speed and we would have a few of us in

17:18.259 --> 17:19.278
body bags

17:19.278 --> 17:24.409
this is great how did you talk to father
into it

17:24.409 --> 17:28.610
I didn't have to it was weird you seem
anxious to go

17:28.609 --> 17:35.898
it's not that weird a pretty damn
charming guy you know what I mean you

17:35.898 --> 17:37.569
know

17:37.569 --> 17:42.970
if this works out you might regret it
the more you dig into my family

17:42.970 --> 17:47.200
the harder it is to get up that's
exactly what I want

17:47.200 --> 17:50.200
wait till you meet my bunch back in the
mainland

17:51.159 --> 17:54.399
there is one secret you need to know
about my father we take them out of the

17:54.398 --> 17:55.599
water bill

17:55.599 --> 17:58.599
yeah what's that you can't swim

18:00.059 --> 18:02.329
at all

18:02.329 --> 18:05.329
not a stroke

18:10.089 --> 18:14.829

inflatable your co he rocks

22:30.410 --> 22:37.070
yeah

22:45.619 --> 22:49.609
come on sean mckenna was against both of
us you said so yourself

22:50.450 --> 22:53.539
now is the time to strike while he's
weak

22:53.539 --> 22:57.649
you don't think it's gonna give up do
you come on shine

22:57.650 --> 23:02.420
he thinks you are a pompous jerk who's
taking up money and space his opinion of

23:02.420 --> 23:04.160
me isn't any of my business

23:04.160 --> 23:09.558
Oh grow up Shawn when somebody tries to
hurt you have to come back twice as hard

23:09.558 --> 23:12.558
and put them out of business for good
things Act doesn't think like that

23:13.220 --> 23:17.390
oh well that was below the belt we both
know that McKenna was the reason for

23:17.390 --> 23:22.759
this accident Sean he piloted aircraft
you hadn't been on for over a year

23:22.759 --> 23:27.109
you went too fast you ignored your
passengers advice and my orders and in

23:27.109 --> 23:31.129
the end your behavior will be judged the
very least to significantly contributed

23:31.130 --> 23:36.020
to his injury and you're near death
which would have been a done deal that

23:36.019 --> 23:37.609
hadn't been for his heroism

23:37.609 --> 23:42.379
now I would be thankful that mechanic
called off the special session and leave

23:42.380 --> 23:43.940
it at that okay

23:43.940 --> 23:47.390
look shine I know Zach saved my life

23:48.049 --> 23:51.049
I'm not cold that meant something to me

23:52.779 --> 23:55.779
I said thank you

23:58.609 --> 24:02.298
you know honestly I'm as much to blame
as you are for letting you and your

24:02.298 --> 24:04.429
entourage be out there in the beginning

24:04.429 --> 24:09.530
now if there's nothing else Jenna all
I'm asking you sean is to file a lawsuit

24:09.529 --> 24:11.720
against mckenna and his kid

24:11.720 --> 24:14.808
it'll put a scare into them I have told
you many times

24:14.808 --> 24:18.829
yeah yeah yeah you don't believe in
lawsuits well maybe you don't believe in

24:18.829 --> 24:23.389
fire earthquake swarm or hurricanes but
they still sure as hell tear things up

24:23.390 --> 24:25.790
in the real world where the rest of us
live

24:25.789 --> 24:31.609
okay now you're not making any sense and
i do have work to do Jenna I going to do

24:31.609 --> 24:38.269
something about this Sean you can count
on it

24:40.210 --> 24:42.539
and

24:42.539 --> 24:45.539
mmm

24:48.900 --> 24:53.100
does it look like we get much on these
lines

24:53.099 --> 24:55.788
maybe I should repeat that

24:55.788 --> 24:57.759
of course

24:57.759 --> 25:03.309
this isn't exactly what I had in mind
cuz you are sittin on the stern waiting

25:03.309 --> 25:06.309
for strike picking out drinking beer and
sake

25:06.309 --> 25:09.309
I don't know what's wrong with the
autopilot

25:10.359 --> 25:13.359
so this is all topping so seaworthy
after all

25:14.410 --> 25:21.040
guess not but so what right let's break
out the growing light fishy perfect

25:21.039 --> 25:25.000
I don't hold on the Sun I'll take the

25:25.569 --> 25:31.929
roast beef sandwich and a cobia and stop
kissing my butt like some third

25:31.930 --> 25:34.720
classification right

25:34.720 --> 25:37.720
ok

25:43.529 --> 25:46.529
ok

25:55.430 --> 25:58.789
can be damned unpleasant you know that

25:58.789 --> 26:01.819
yeah i know it takes for any practice

26:07.220 --> 26:13.038
oh boy t spill out here in the water
yeah yeah

26:13.640 --> 26:20.809
so this is what attracted you to your
career choice now do love the water but

26:20.808 --> 26:22.158
it wasn't that

26:22.159 --> 26:28.220
so what did you don't care about that
anymore than I do about your stupid side

26:28.220 --> 26:31.220
so you're going to finally start talking
straight

26:31.220 --> 26:34.429
look you want to start yelling at each
other again

26:34.429 --> 26:42.320
I can do that what's the point the point
is I value honesty above every date

26:42.319 --> 26:44.058
about you

26:44.058 --> 26:46.658
yeah I guess

26:46.659 --> 26:54.009
if it takes a conflict to achieve
honesty and why I avoid the conflict

26:54.009 --> 26:59.558
look at you this happy monkey active
yours

26:59.558 --> 27:06.878
it's not really you were because if it
is you are definitely not with my

27:06.878 --> 27:10.478
daughter or anyone else's daughter for
that matter

27:13.619 --> 27:16.619
what are you taking off

27:31.279 --> 27:34.279
Wow looks like you're having an
interesting afternoon

27:34.940 --> 27:38.509

the good air

27:39.170 --> 27:44.660
hey toddy i'll have a mineral water no I
got it and killing them here without all

27:44.660 --> 27:46.220
day

27:46.220 --> 27:49.220
so where's your special friend Peggy

27:49.220 --> 27:55.579
she's at the training center where I
should be a page of friend okay

27:56.298 --> 28:04.609
friend I trust he did indicate wow yeah
sure fine

28:06.230 --> 28:10.669
you studied most swim through the pearly
gates you did they are you go i'll have

28:10.669 --> 28:15.530
another don't worry I'll get him over

28:18.169 --> 28:22.999
I happen to be trying and jumped in
bones and a half step acts like a guy

28:22.999 --> 28:25.489
with you first

28:25.489 --> 28:29.840
stop playing the brave suffering trainee
activity because you and I both know you

28:29.839 --> 28:33.439
are plenty pissed off at me and pull
into feeling sorry for yourself

28:33.440 --> 28:38.899
we clear now whether or not you ever
hear out of that year of yours is

28:38.898 --> 28:42.048
completely unimportant to me but it
should be to you because you can't

28:42.048 --> 28:43.038
control that

28:43.038 --> 28:47.419
and if you continue to waste times
bothering about things you can control

28:47.419 --> 28:48.528
you'll be next

28:48.528 --> 28:51.679
everything for the rest of your
laid-back worth with how that life

28:52.579 --> 28:56.569
however if you're smart enough to take
advantage of an opportunity

28:57.558 --> 29:01.519
you might find that you can change
things

29:02.700 --> 29:05.700
and make a whole lot of cash in the
bargain

29:08.289 --> 29:12.159
sure version of existence is so
perfectly narrow

29:12.160 --> 29:17.410
it's no wonder kekoa count on one hand
the times you smiled or laugh or showed

29:17.410 --> 29:20.019
any enjoyment in life at all

29:20.019 --> 29:23.379
only a child things

29:23.380 --> 29:29.440
life should be enjoyable is this
freaking fishing trip enjoyable not you

29:29.440 --> 29:33.730
know why because you detest me and I
detest fishing because it's the most

29:33.730 --> 29:36.730
boring nothing simple waste the time

29:37.240 --> 29:42.009
life is to be challenged boy to be
wrestled with us to be shaped into

29:42.009 --> 29:47.109
something that your family can feel safe
in the safety is a lie according to you

29:47.109 --> 29:52.240
and so is charity forgiveness empathy
and the pure Nicki pleasure and helping

29:52.240 --> 29:53.470
another human being

29:53.470 --> 29:57.370
making a difference or saving a life
tell me something

29:57.369 --> 30:06.339
what is the monetary value in saving the
life we talking about the measurable

30:06.339 --> 30:10.990
society measures everything boy stop
calling me that

30:11.529 --> 30:16.180
yeah well it's stop thinking like one if
your life-saving profession was so

30:16.180 --> 30:20.799
important so valuable to this earth that
you would be paid

30:20.799 --> 30:24.129
immensely you might even be able to
support a family

30:24.819 --> 30:28.720
Kieko is right you're completely empty
you only care about money

30:29.230 --> 30:34.990

me at least now she has a man in her

34:07.109 --> 34:12.779
huh you stubborn and prideful cake

34:24.280 --> 34:27.280
ok

34:31.469 --> 34:37.618
Jenna cat named zach has a plaintiff in
this case that implicitly involves

34:37.619 --> 34:42.480
Baywatch why and myself and I was very
clear about how I feel about lawsuits in

34:42.480 --> 34:45.389
general and your liability in this case
specifically

34:45.389 --> 34:49.530
mm that's too bad John it's already been
done my lawyer works very quickly making

34:49.530 --> 34:51.869
has already been served and undo it

34:51.869 --> 34:55.949
no Sean I didn't realize you were so
crazy about this course you couldn't

34:55.949 --> 35:00.358
why would she tell you you obviously
wanted me to make a gesture toward zack

35:00.358 --> 35:01.500
and I did

35:01.500 --> 35:05.519
now if through my actions he no longer
has a career in life-saving then at

35:05.519 --> 35:08.730
least this action might afford them some
financial security

35:09.300 --> 35:15.150
Zach this job was never about making
money and money can't make up for not

35:15.150 --> 35:16.289
having it

35:16.289 --> 35:20.969
oh god Sean that is not the point I look
me in the eyes here's a key if you can

35:20.969 --> 35:24.809
look me in the eyes and tell me that
taking more money from this bad guy and

35:24.809 --> 35:29.070
his misguided something you ever dreamed
about making life-saving will satisfy

35:29.070 --> 35:32.609
what drove you here to train in the
beginning and you're not the person that

35:32.608 --> 35:36.630
I thought you were a man i was flipped
out she got me drunk

35:36.630 --> 35:40.320
I think that that is the biggest bunch
of baloney that I have ever heard

35:40.889 --> 35:45.150
Sean we all know that cash is America's
favorite comfort food and the quickest

35:45.150 --> 35:50.639
way for most people to get that is a big
fat lawsuit and Jenna you are exactly

35:50.639 --> 35:52.710
the person that I thought you were

35:52.710 --> 35:54.220
thank you shine

I came to tell you that i owe a great
debt of gratitude that I can never repay

38:24.219 --> 38:31.599
you saved my life and in the process I
learned a great deal about my own

38:31.599 --> 38:35.170
mortality and my own arrogance

38:35.710 --> 38:38.769
Oh for you

I would like that very much I also
gained a deeper appreciation of the work

38:51.849 --> 38:58.269
you do and a much better understanding
of the affection that my daughter kayla

38:58.269 --> 38:59.590
has for you

38:59.590 --> 39:05.050
thank you now I want to be very very
clear

39:05.050 --> 39:08.619
much has changed much has stayed the
same

39:09.369 --> 39:12.369
JD

39:12.929 --> 39:19.318
you will never be a banker or an
industrialist for a silicon valley

39:19.318 --> 39:24.150
entrepreneur but you've made it very
clear to me that that is not your desire

39:24.150 --> 39:32.010
but therefore therefore you will never
be able to give the comfort the security

39:32.010 --> 39:35.010
and the safety that my daughter needs

39:36.659 --> 39:38.039
it's not God

39:38.039 --> 39:41.400
this is not a slight against you

39:41.400 --> 39:48.420
JD this is the truth and if you love kit
car as much as you say you do then you

39:48.420 --> 39:51.420
will accept the truth

39:56.960 --> 40:01.460

house and a mongoose

40:14.179 --> 40:17.419
