WEBVTT

00:31.531 --> 00:33.408
Okay, settle down, boosters.

00:34.451 --> 00:36.494
Boys, we could go all the way this year.

00:36.578 --> 00:38.204
Texas High School Coaches Poll

00:38.288 --> 00:40.498
has voted us preseason number one.

00:40.582 --> 00:42.459
-Hey, all right!
That's amazing, huh?

00:42.542 --> 00:44.919
Yep, this is the year, I'll tell you what,

00:45.003 --> 00:46.921
but as boosters, we've gotta do our part.

00:47.005 --> 00:48.048
I've got it!

00:48.131 --> 00:49.632
A pancake sale,

00:49.716 --> 00:53.011
where we get our wives
to serve pancakes topless.

00:53.386 --> 00:54.888
Not yours, Hank.

00:54.971 --> 00:56.639
Well, here's something that'll help.

00:56.723 --> 00:58.475
Finish what you're chewing, boys.

00:58.558 --> 01:00.101
I got big news.

01:00.185 --> 01:02.145
Jimmy Willis is available.

01:02.228 --> 01:04.147
The groundskeeper at SMU?

01:04.230 --> 01:05.523
A skilled groundskeeper

01:05.607 --> 01:07.734
can give us a home field advantage.

01:07.817 --> 01:09.110
We're going to state!

01:09.194 --> 01:10.612
-Whoa!
Yeah, we're going to state!

01:10.695 --> 01:12.572
-Going to state!
State! State! State!

01:12.655 --> 01:13.782
Wait just a second.

01:13.865 --> 01:14.908
What about Smitty?

01:14.991 --> 01:17.744
He's been our groundskeeper
as long as I can remember.

01:17.827 --> 01:20.371
Oh, Hank, Smitty's getting up there
in years.

01:20.455 --> 01:21.498
-Heck, a lot of folks think

01:21.581 --> 01:23.291
he's just coasting
till he gets his pension.

01:23.374 --> 01:25.960
Yeah. You seen the horns
on the end zone Longhorn lately?

01:26.044 --> 01:27.378
They ain't as pointy as they used to be.

01:27.462 --> 01:29.506
Thing looks like a got-danged cow!

01:29.589 --> 01:32.133
-
It does have a cow-like quality.

01:32.217 --> 01:33.301
A thought.

01:33.384 --> 01:35.637
Just supposing we fire this Smitty.

01:35.720 --> 01:37.555
What would happen to his pension money?

01:37.639 --> 01:40.642
Could it be diverted into,
say, a new Nautilus machine?

01:40.767 --> 01:42.644
And if not, why not?

01:42.727 --> 01:43.728
-Hmm...
Yeah.

01:43.812 --> 01:44.687
Now hold on.

01:44.771 --> 01:46.940
You can't cheat Smitty out of his pension.

01:47.023 --> 01:47.982
It's not right.

01:48.066 --> 01:51.569
He's been taking good care
of that field for 28 years.

01:51.653 --> 01:53.530
He lost two wives to that grass,

01:53.613 --> 01:55.490
and now you wanna take it away from him?

01:55.573 --> 01:57.075
Smitty can do the job.

01:57.158 --> 01:58.493
I guarantee it.

01:59.828 --> 02:02.622
Hank says championship's a lock!

02:04.582 --> 02:06.668
State! State! State! State!

02:09.295 --> 02:11.089
Looking for someone, bud?

02:11.172 --> 02:13.174
Well, I was looking for you, Smitty.

02:13.258 --> 02:15.009
I'm Hank Hill. I used to play here.

02:15.093 --> 02:17.679
Oh, sure, Hank Hill.

02:17.762 --> 02:21.850
You hold Arlen High's single-season
rushing record, don't ya?

02:21.933 --> 02:25.478
Yep. I ran nearly every foot of it
on your turf.

02:25.562 --> 02:27.188
Sure. Sure.

02:27.272 --> 02:29.440
You can't run on dirt, you know?

02:29.524 --> 02:30.567
True enough.

02:30.650 --> 02:32.902
But you can sleep on it.

02:36.823 --> 02:38.741
Huh. Uh...

02:38.825 --> 02:41.077
You do know what
you're doing, Smitty, right?

02:41.161 --> 02:42.245
You bet.

02:42.328 --> 02:45.206
That's exactly what
I was hoping to hear, sir.

02:46.249 --> 02:48.251
It's gonna be a heck of a season.

02:49.878 --> 02:50.920
<i>Up next.</i>

02:51.004 --> 02:53.631
History's Mysteries
<i>with "Nazi Hidden Gold,"</i>

02:53.715 --> 02:56.259
<i>followed by</i> Building the Nazi War Machine,

02:56.342 --> 02:59.345
<i>and</i> Nazis of the Desert, Nazis of the Sea.

02:59.429 --> 03:02.098
Wow, the Nazis did a lot.

03:04.976 --> 03:07.228
Come on, Kahn.
Ain't we still your boys?

03:07.312 --> 03:08.313
Get on out here

03:08.396 --> 03:09.230
and rally with us.

03:09.314 --> 03:10.440
I thought Kahn

03:10.523 --> 03:12.275
got rid of those damn rednecks.

03:12.358 --> 03:14.402
Show him your high beams, Lucky.

03:14.485 --> 03:16.446
Whoo!

03:16.529 --> 03:18.323
Those rednecks!

03:18.823 --> 03:19.824
Yeah!

03:19.908 --> 03:22.493
That redneck thing
was really more of a phase!

03:22.577 --> 03:24.204
Please go away now!

03:24.287 --> 03:26.664
You had to send him a Christmas card.

03:26.748 --> 03:28.082
Thanks for leaving!

03:28.166 --> 03:31.836
We ain't going nowhere
till you check out Lucky's new truck.

03:31.920 --> 03:32.754
Yeah, Kahn.

03:32.837 --> 03:35.256
Got me new rims and everything
out of my settlement money.

03:35.340 --> 03:37.634
We gon' go muddin', then skiddin'.

03:37.717 --> 03:39.093
Stupid rednecks!

03:39.844 --> 03:42.639
We can't hear ourselves watch TV.

03:46.684 --> 03:48.811
Aw, look at you, baby girl.

03:48.895 --> 03:50.563
You like my rims.

03:50.647 --> 03:52.315
They're very nice rims. I...

03:52.398 --> 03:53.399
Yes.

03:53.483 --> 03:55.276
You think they look good standing still,

03:55.360 --> 03:56.861
wait till you see 'em doing 90.

03:56.945 --> 03:59.447
There are some boys race trucks
up at the Devil's Bowl,

03:59.530 --> 04:00.990
and I'm gonna take it to 'em.

04:01.074 --> 04:02.742
You race trucks?

04:02.825 --> 04:04.369
Isn't that dangerous?

04:04.452 --> 04:06.704
Can be, but being a self-made man,

04:06.788 --> 04:08.289
I don't need to work no more.

04:08.373 --> 04:09.874
I got to do something with my time.

04:09.958 --> 04:11.960
You're a self-made man?

04:12.043 --> 04:14.420
Yep. Slipped on pee-pee at the Costco.

04:14.504 --> 04:16.839
Got me a $53,000 settlement.

04:16.923 --> 04:19.968
I like the way your Skoal
can fits in your pocket.

04:20.051 --> 04:22.637
And your teeth look like fresh corn.

04:22.720 --> 04:26.224
Damn. That Lucky is chick stink bait.

04:26.307 --> 04:28.184
Walk away from the redneck.

04:28.268 --> 04:30.186
Walk away from the redneck.

04:32.230 --> 04:33.189
Oh, no.

04:34.607 --> 04:36.150
Friday night, the big test.

04:36.234 --> 04:38.403
Season opener against Rushford.

04:38.486 --> 04:40.029
Crush Rushford!

04:40.113 --> 04:41.447
That's the spirit, Bobby.

04:41.531 --> 04:43.324
I can't take sole credit.

04:43.408 --> 04:45.618
They taught it to us all week at school.

04:46.995 --> 04:48.454
<i>Attention!</i>

04:48.538 --> 04:49.998
<i>Will the pretty lady in the house</i>

04:50.081 --> 04:53.126
<i>please come outside and make my day?</i>

04:53.209 --> 04:54.585
That's Lucky!

04:54.669 --> 04:56.421
He's taking me
to watch him race his truck!

04:56.504 --> 04:59.382
I get to wave a flag and wear tiny pants!

04:59.465 --> 05:00.842
Uh-uh. I'm sorry, Luanne,

05:00.925 --> 05:02.593
but I cannot allow you to go out there.

05:02.677 --> 05:04.637
Why not? Is my makeup smeary?

05:04.721 --> 05:06.889
No. Luanne, you have a weakness

05:06.973 --> 05:09.017
for a certain type of man.

05:09.100 --> 05:11.853
You are drawn magnetically
back to the trailer,

05:11.936 --> 05:14.397
back to the sticky ooze you escaped from.

05:14.480 --> 05:16.607
You have come too far to give in now.

05:16.691 --> 05:18.401
You cannot date this man!

05:21.738 --> 05:23.031
I'll get it.

05:25.783 --> 05:26.701
Name's Lucky.

05:26.784 --> 05:27.994
Looking for Luanne.

05:28.536 --> 05:29.704
Hey, beautiful.

05:29.787 --> 05:31.372
Hi.

05:33.583 --> 05:35.209
Wanna know why they call me Lucky?

05:35.293 --> 05:36.127
No.

05:36.711 --> 05:38.004
We'll see you later.

05:38.087 --> 05:39.339
Don't wait up.

05:39.964 --> 05:41.299
Oh, god.

05:43.134 --> 05:44.510
Crush Rushford.

05:44.594 --> 05:45.720
Thank you, Bobby.

05:45.803 --> 05:47.055
You're a good son.

05:51.142 --> 05:53.936
Let the championship season begin!

05:55.480 --> 05:56.689
Here we go.

06:09.118 --> 06:10.870
-What the...
-Good lord!

06:10.953 --> 06:13.039
What the heck happened to the field?

06:13.122 --> 06:16.042
Hank, what did your boy Smitty
do to the field?

06:16.125 --> 06:18.002
Oh, no. Smitty.

06:25.468 --> 06:28.930
On inspection,
this field is unfit for play.

06:29.013 --> 06:30.765
According to the athletic charter,

06:30.848 --> 06:34.352
the home team is responsible
for the maintenance of the field,

06:34.435 --> 06:37.313
therefore Arlen forfeits the game.

06:38.731 --> 06:40.650
Boo!

06:40.733 --> 06:43.152
Peggy, get the boy
and let's head for the truck

06:43.236 --> 06:44.737
before everyone sees us.

06:46.614 --> 06:48.032
There he is!

06:55.415 --> 06:57.750
No root system at all.

07:00.670 --> 07:02.588
Oh, hi, Hank.

07:03.172 --> 07:06.384
Sir, with all due respect, what happened?

07:06.467 --> 07:08.219
Yeah, I know.

07:08.302 --> 07:10.138
It's a lot to do.

07:10.221 --> 07:12.140
You got the hash marks

07:12.223 --> 07:14.350
and the center field marks.

07:14.475 --> 07:17.603
And what is it, the thing with the tube?

07:18.729 --> 07:20.565
My kid's in rehab again.

07:20.648 --> 07:22.650
Tommy. You met him.

07:23.276 --> 07:26.821
Yeah. Uh, look, Smitty,
this is the kind of thing

07:26.904 --> 07:29.031
that could cost us our whole season.

07:29.115 --> 07:31.826
Not to mention costing a guy his job,

07:31.909 --> 07:32.869
his pension...

07:32.952 --> 07:34.245
You bet.

07:34.328 --> 07:36.497
Hey, Hank, that reminds me

07:36.581 --> 07:39.167
of a thing from a long time ago.

07:40.293 --> 07:41.878
I forget.

07:41.961 --> 07:44.297
You'll get a kick...

07:52.013 --> 07:54.098
So, he likes to sleep, does he?

07:54.182 --> 07:57.226
I can give him sleep in so many ways.

07:57.310 --> 07:59.353
Look, Smitty may have screwed up,

07:59.437 --> 08:02.148
but he's a good man,
and he's done a good job

08:02.231 --> 08:04.817
for 28 of the last 29 years.

08:04.901 --> 08:06.694
We can't let him lose his pension.

08:06.777 --> 08:09.780
But we can't let him lose
any more games for us either.

08:09.864 --> 08:11.699
Well, we've got an away game coming up.

08:11.782 --> 08:13.326
That gives us some time.

08:13.409 --> 08:15.411
There's got to be some way
to save this field

08:15.495 --> 08:17.079
and still save Smitty's job.

08:17.163 --> 08:20.041
Yeah, man, like, dang ol'... how, man?

08:20.124 --> 08:22.001
Well, we're all pretty experienced

08:22.084 --> 08:24.420
when it comes
to maintaining our own lawns.

08:24.504 --> 08:25.922
We just need to treat this field

08:26.005 --> 08:27.673
like it's a really big lawn.

08:27.757 --> 08:28.883
All right!

08:29.008 --> 08:31.093
We'll need really big lawnmowers

08:31.177 --> 08:33.137
and really big beers.

08:39.268 --> 08:40.811
Okay, two teams.

08:40.895 --> 08:43.981
Lead man de-compacts the roots,
follow-man fertigates.

08:44.065 --> 08:45.900
Now, let's roll out.

08:45.983 --> 08:48.486
I feel like I'm cheating on my lawn!

09:08.714 --> 09:10.383
Well, it's been a hard week,

09:10.466 --> 09:13.135
but the grass is healthy,
the horns are pointy.

09:13.219 --> 09:14.470
Good work, gentlemen.

09:14.554 --> 09:17.265
If this field could talk,
I bet it would say

09:17.348 --> 09:19.267
"Thanks for watering me, Bill.

09:19.350 --> 09:21.352
I was very thirsty.

09:21.435 --> 09:24.105
So, handsome, got any plans Friday night?"

09:29.151 --> 09:30.403
Evenin', boys.

09:30.486 --> 09:32.321
Anybody interested in a race?

09:33.906 --> 09:34.949
In what?

09:35.032 --> 09:38.244
You hauling a real truck
behind that little candy truck?

09:38.327 --> 09:40.121
What you sayin' about my truck?

09:40.204 --> 09:42.915
Well, that shiny bumper
looks like it belongs

09:42.999 --> 09:44.542
on Barbie's Dream Truck.

09:45.876 --> 09:47.003
Y'all shut up!

09:47.086 --> 09:48.921
This truck is beautiful.

09:49.005 --> 09:51.841
I call it Pretty-Pretty Truck-Truck!

10:01.183 --> 10:03.936
I can't race, and I don't have to work.

10:04.020 --> 10:05.813
What am I gonna do with myself?

10:05.896 --> 10:08.316
We could go buy some more chrome.

10:08.399 --> 10:09.400
Thanks, baby.

10:09.483 --> 10:12.320
But chrome is the reason
I'm sitting here and not racing.

10:13.029 --> 10:16.282
Sometimes the world is cruel
to shiny things.

10:17.116 --> 10:18.200
What have we got here?

10:20.494 --> 10:21.912
Hmm...

10:27.168 --> 10:29.754
I was all set
to hand you your head today, Smitty,

10:29.837 --> 10:32.256
but it looks like this turf
is back on track.

10:32.340 --> 10:35.051
Yeah? Track?

10:35.134 --> 10:36.469
Oh, sure, sure.

10:36.552 --> 10:38.179
Yeah, great job, Smitty.

10:38.262 --> 10:41.766
Who the heck but you would have thought
of tweaking the pH balance

10:41.849 --> 10:43.392
to give it a healthy shine?

10:43.476 --> 10:45.311
Hooray for Smitty!

10:45.394 --> 10:48.606
Or should I say "The Wizard of Sod"?

10:48.689 --> 10:51.192
-Way to go!
-Man, you're a dang ol' wiz, man!

10:51.275 --> 10:52.693
Yeah, nice work, Smitty.

10:52.777 --> 10:54.987
But we've got a big game against Killeen,

10:55.071 --> 10:56.656
so you better keep it up.

10:56.739 --> 10:59.575
Well, Coach, we'll let you
get down to business.

10:59.659 --> 11:00.743
"Kill Killeen."

11:00.826 --> 11:01.911
-Kill Killeen!
-Kill Killeen!

11:02.078 --> 11:03.412
Kill Killeen!

11:04.664 --> 11:05.539
Yep.

11:05.623 --> 11:06.499
Yup.

11:07.208 --> 11:08.084
Yup.

11:08.709 --> 11:09.794
Mm-hmm.

11:10.169 --> 11:12.254
Who's gonna dare me to kill that bird?

11:13.089 --> 11:14.256
Yeah.

11:14.882 --> 11:16.884
Well, it's gonna be a long season,

11:16.967 --> 11:18.678
and Smitty still needs our help.

11:18.761 --> 11:20.971
Yeah, plus Killeen's got that running back

11:21.055 --> 11:23.349
who's pretty much unstoppable.

11:23.432 --> 11:25.601
Unless...

11:26.060 --> 11:28.145
Wait, can you give someone polio?

11:28.229 --> 11:29.939
No, but what we could do

11:30.022 --> 11:32.942
is fine-tune the field
a little bit to our advantage.

11:33.025 --> 11:34.485
Within regulation.

11:34.568 --> 11:36.404
You mean to slow him down a bit.

11:36.487 --> 11:37.822
Yes, exactly.

11:44.078 --> 11:46.163
Guess it's just you and me, bird.

11:50.292 --> 11:51.919
<i>That's the ballgame, folks.</i>

11:52.002 --> 11:55.673
<i>Final score, Arlen, 27, Killeen, 10.</i>

11:58.050 --> 11:59.552
Great game, Coach.

11:59.635 --> 12:01.637
Sure looked like Killeen's running back

12:01.721 --> 12:04.140
had trouble getting
around the end, eh, Smitty?

12:04.223 --> 12:06.809
Eh? Ah, you bet.

12:06.892 --> 12:08.561
Kind of looked to me like the grass

12:08.644 --> 12:10.813
was a little thicker near the sidelines.

12:10.896 --> 12:14.066
Well, goddangit, Smitty,
that was brilliant.

12:14.150 --> 12:15.151
Yeah?

12:15.234 --> 12:17.486
The Wizard of Sod!

12:17.570 --> 12:20.156
Well, Wizard, I hope you got
a trick up your sleeve

12:20.239 --> 12:22.867
to stop Duncanville's
hotshot kicker next week.

12:25.119 --> 12:26.412
See you tonight, guys.

12:26.495 --> 12:28.372
We got a kicker to stop.

12:31.041 --> 12:32.209
<i>Arlen wins.</i>

12:32.293 --> 12:35.087
<i>Next stop, division playoffs.</i>

12:37.423 --> 12:40.426
<i>Smitty, I've never seen
a kicker shank so many field goals.</i>

12:40.509 --> 12:41.552
How do you do it?

12:41.635 --> 12:45.848
So, I think to myself,
"Grass'll do the trick."

12:45.931 --> 12:48.058
So, that's what I did.

12:48.142 --> 12:49.435
Mm-hmm.

12:49.518 --> 12:51.896
Wizard, words don't describe.

12:51.979 --> 12:54.398
Smitty, you and your enchanted lawnmower

12:54.482 --> 12:56.942
must help us
in our critical game against Denton.

12:57.026 --> 12:57.985
Your thoughts?

12:58.068 --> 13:01.697
I don't think the Wizard's gonna
wanna give up his secrets that easy.

13:01.781 --> 13:02.740
Butt out, blockhead!

13:03.324 --> 13:04.909
The Wizard's talking here.

13:05.576 --> 13:08.537
People think dandelions are pretty.

13:08.621 --> 13:11.457
But they're a weed, you know.

13:22.510 --> 13:24.345
Ma'am. Luanne home?

13:25.513 --> 13:28.808
Luanne works, Lucky, as do I on many days.

13:28.891 --> 13:31.894
Now, I am warning you,
you stay away from Luanne.

13:33.521 --> 13:34.688
Lucky!

13:34.772 --> 13:36.774
I took off work early today!

13:36.857 --> 13:38.692
Aren't you gonna honk me a kiss?

13:46.992 --> 13:48.160
-Let me out.
-No.

13:48.244 --> 13:49.870
Not until you listen to some sense.

13:49.954 --> 13:50.996
Lucky is not the kind of man--

13:51.080 --> 13:54.291
Aunt Peggy, Lucky says
if we were both in lockup,

13:54.375 --> 13:56.252
I could probably take you.

13:56.335 --> 14:00.005
But I don't wanna do that
because we're family.

14:06.554 --> 14:08.681
<i>So, Sports Jock,
we've got a very special guest today.</i>

14:08.764 --> 14:11.016
<i>Arlen High's secret ticket to State,</i>

14:11.100 --> 14:13.310
<i>the Wizard of Sod, Smitty.</i>

14:13.394 --> 14:16.021
<i>State is in sight, but, Wizard,</i>

14:16.105 --> 14:18.691
<i>Denton leads the division
in rushing and sacks.</i>

14:18.774 --> 14:22.319
<i>You see any way to, uh, "even
the playing field," so to speak?</i>

14:22.403 --> 14:24.238
<i>Don't ask stupid questions.</i>

14:24.321 --> 14:26.448
<i>Look who you're talking to here.</i>

14:26.532 --> 14:28.742
<i>For Denton, I'm thinking water.</i>

14:28.826 --> 14:30.327
<i>And sticky paint.</i>

14:30.411 --> 14:32.371
<i>They ain't gonna see that comin'.</i>

14:32.454 --> 14:34.331
<i>The Wizard has spoken.</i>

14:34.832 --> 14:38.210
Is it just because I've been up all night
doing Smitty's job

14:38.294 --> 14:39.920
that I'm starting to dislike him?

14:40.004 --> 14:43.924
Smitty's one interview away
from a pencil to the eardrum.

14:44.008 --> 14:46.760
Hank, can we tell everybody we did it?

14:46.844 --> 14:49.847
No. Look, Smitty's ego
may be getting a little too big,

14:49.930 --> 14:52.516
but he still deserves
to retire with dignity.

14:52.600 --> 14:54.018
Now we need to knuckle down

14:54.101 --> 14:55.978
and find a way to stop Denton.

14:59.273 --> 15:01.817
Hank, this is hard!

15:01.901 --> 15:04.820
And Bill's not carrying
my share of the load!

15:04.904 --> 15:08.282
Hang in there, guys,
and we'll have championship seat cushions

15:08.365 --> 15:10.659
to cherish for the rest of our lives.

15:10.743 --> 15:12.661
Thanks for the lift, fellas.

15:12.745 --> 15:14.204
It was on our way, Wizard.

15:14.288 --> 15:16.332
Anything to help you take us to State.

15:16.415 --> 15:17.291
Mmm...

15:20.461 --> 15:22.546
Hey, they're on my field!

15:22.630 --> 15:25.674
Hank Hill, why you wrecking my field, boy?

15:25.758 --> 15:27.468
Sir, with all due respect,

15:27.551 --> 15:29.678
we've only been helping out
with some basic--

15:29.762 --> 15:32.514
"Basic"? I've done this for 30 years, son!

15:32.598 --> 15:34.683
I'm the Wizard, the ticket to State!

15:34.767 --> 15:36.518
You don't tell me, I tell you!

15:36.602 --> 15:38.729
Now get off my goddang grass!

15:39.897 --> 15:40.981
Yeah,

15:41.065 --> 15:42.775
I see it now.

15:42.858 --> 15:45.736
What we need this week is longer grass.

15:45.819 --> 15:49.990
And I'm gonna triple-pump her
with ammonium nitrate,

15:50.074 --> 15:51.700
make it grow fast.

15:51.784 --> 15:53.661
Show you, boys, how it's done.

15:53.744 --> 15:56.789
No! Too much nitrate'll fry
the root system.

15:56.872 --> 15:58.082
The whole field'll die.

15:58.165 --> 16:00.084
And with it, the championship!

16:00.167 --> 16:02.878
My self-esteem is tied to this season!

16:02.962 --> 16:04.338
You must be stopped!

16:06.966 --> 16:10.678
Sam, get these crooks off of my grass.

16:10.761 --> 16:12.054
You can't do this!

16:12.137 --> 16:13.514
Let's not have this escalate.

16:13.597 --> 16:14.765
Move along, sir.

16:14.848 --> 16:20.187
Now, what else does the Wizard
have up his sleeve?

16:20.729 --> 16:22.856
I've got it! Rock salt!

16:22.940 --> 16:24.108
Rock salt?

16:24.191 --> 16:26.652
-And plenty of it!
-No!

16:29.363 --> 16:30.948
Looks like fine weather Friday night

16:31.031 --> 16:33.701
for Arlen's big victory,
and then it's off to State.

16:33.784 --> 16:34.952
Here's hoping.

16:35.035 --> 16:36.787
Death to Denton, shugs!

16:36.870 --> 16:38.914
Death to Denton.

16:38.998 --> 16:39.873
I'll get her.

16:39.957 --> 16:42.960
My people do not wish death
to the people of Denton,

16:43.085 --> 16:45.921
but a crushing defeat would be just swell.

16:46.005 --> 16:47.840
Oh, god, I can just imagine

16:47.923 --> 16:50.551
what Smitty is doing
to that field right now.

16:50.634 --> 16:52.720
It's not fair we're gonna have to forfeit.

16:52.803 --> 16:55.264
How come McMaynerbury
didn't have to forfeit last year

16:55.347 --> 16:56.515
when their field was flooded?

16:56.598 --> 16:58.142
That was because of rain.

16:58.225 --> 17:01.729
Article 14 says acts of God
and vandalism are deemed

17:01.812 --> 17:04.398
to be outside the control
of the home team.

17:06.066 --> 17:08.068
No. We can't let this happen.

17:08.152 --> 17:09.445
The team's come this far,

17:09.528 --> 17:11.488
and we're not gonna let 'em down.

17:25.127 --> 17:27.087
We're too late.

17:27.171 --> 17:29.798
This is even worse than the first game.

17:29.882 --> 17:31.508
There goes our season.

17:31.592 --> 17:32.509
Look at this.

17:32.593 --> 17:35.429
I think he actually nailed the sod down.

17:40.184 --> 17:43.687
Uh, Bobby, looks like I'm free this Friday

17:43.771 --> 17:46.356
if you wanna see that Hilary Duff movie.

17:46.440 --> 17:49.359
<i>The Princess and the Poor Girl?</i> All right!

17:49.443 --> 17:51.487
Hank, I can't stand it any longer.

17:51.570 --> 17:54.364
We have to do something
about Lucky and Luanne.

17:54.448 --> 17:57.409
Tonight, they are out
on a date... in our driveway.

17:57.493 --> 17:59.870
He's been in twice already
to use our bathroom,

17:59.953 --> 18:03.207
and both times,
he challenged me to race his truck.

18:03.290 --> 18:05.375
Peggy, there's nothing I can do...

18:05.459 --> 18:06.877
This is your problem too, Hank.

18:06.960 --> 18:11.381
On my way in, I saw a very large
truck tire mark on your lawn.

18:11.465 --> 18:12.466
What?

18:15.260 --> 18:17.387
Goddang it, Lucky!

18:17.471 --> 18:19.014
Yeah, tell me 'bout it.

18:19.098 --> 18:20.974
These treads are hell on grass.

18:25.062 --> 18:26.980
So, Lucky,

18:27.064 --> 18:29.733
looks like you've got
a pretty fast truck there.

18:29.817 --> 18:32.152
It is fast, not that anyone would know it.

18:32.236 --> 18:33.487
Well, I know it.

18:33.570 --> 18:35.572
And what good does that do me?

18:35.656 --> 18:37.324
The boys down at the Devil's Bowl

18:37.407 --> 18:40.327
won't let Lucky race
his shiny truck at their track.

18:40.410 --> 18:41.578
No, sirree.

18:41.662 --> 18:44.164
Well, maybe you should race 'em
someplace else.

18:44.248 --> 18:45.332
I know a good place.

18:45.415 --> 18:47.292
But how am I supposed to get 'em to come?

18:47.376 --> 18:49.837
They think I ain't got jack
under the hood.

18:49.920 --> 18:53.006
And, uh, you're just gonna sit here
and take that?

18:53.090 --> 18:54.341
You ever think that maybe

18:54.424 --> 18:56.802
they're the ones who ain't
got jack under the hood?

18:58.929 --> 19:00.430
What'd you say, boy?

19:00.514 --> 19:03.934
I'm just sayin' none of y'all
got jack under the hood.

19:05.102 --> 19:07.604
Well, y'all have a pleasant evening.

19:10.065 --> 19:11.817
-I'll show him who ain't got jack!
-Get him!

19:12.860 --> 19:14.027
Whoo-hoo!

19:17.865 --> 19:19.491
Hmm.

19:19.575 --> 19:21.201
You hear something, Phil?

19:34.923 --> 19:36.758
Go! Go, Lucky!

19:36.842 --> 19:38.468
Go, go, go, Lucky!

19:38.552 --> 19:40.262
Whoo-hoo!

19:40.345 --> 19:43.390
Lucky's just earned himself
a booster jacket,

19:43.473 --> 19:45.934
even if he does cut the sleeves off.

19:46.018 --> 19:48.854
Oh, great. Now he's a freaking hero.

19:50.230 --> 19:51.899
I mean, I just couldn't believe it.

19:51.982 --> 19:53.650
The whole thing was so crazy.

19:53.734 --> 19:56.945
All these rednecks just kept chasing
this one redneck around.

19:57.029 --> 19:58.697
It was like something out of a video game.

19:58.780 --> 20:00.908
Well, it's vandalism, all right.

20:00.991 --> 20:03.744
No question. The home team is not liable.

20:03.827 --> 20:04.828
The game can proceed,

20:04.912 --> 20:07.372
but at a neutral site to be determined.

20:10.125 --> 20:11.710
Boy, I just think it's a shame

20:11.793 --> 20:14.046
someone would do this
to Smitty's masterwork

20:14.129 --> 20:15.714
after all he's given this town.

20:15.797 --> 20:16.673
Huh?

20:16.757 --> 20:18.717
Yeah, well, there's gonna be a big bonus

20:18.800 --> 20:20.010
to your pension, Smitty.

20:20.093 --> 20:21.178
I'll see to it.

20:21.261 --> 20:22.763
That's great.

20:22.846 --> 20:25.849
Now I can finally go to that place.

20:26.391 --> 20:28.018
Oh, what's it called?

20:28.101 --> 20:29.436
The flat one.

20:29.519 --> 20:31.480
Oh, I can't wait.

20:33.941 --> 20:36.276
There goes the greatest groundskeeper

20:36.360 --> 20:38.028
this team will ever see.

20:38.528 --> 20:39.488
Yep.

20:39.571 --> 20:40.530
Yep.

20:40.864 --> 20:41.823
Mm-hmm.

20:42.324 --> 20:44.201
Oh, let's get him back.

20:44.284 --> 20:45.202
Aah!

20:48.413 --> 20:50.249
So, man, what'd you get?

20:50.332 --> 20:53.168
I got me 400 hours
of damn community service

20:53.252 --> 20:55.212
is what I got, and a fine.

20:55.295 --> 20:58.507
But I still got my
$18,000 settlement, by God.

20:58.590 --> 21:00.759
Won't have to work another day in my life.

21:00.842 --> 21:01.802
Damn.

21:01.885 --> 21:03.178
Lucky!

21:03.262 --> 21:04.638
Arlen beat Denton!

21:04.721 --> 21:06.390
We're going to State!

21:06.473 --> 21:07.683
I love you!

21:09.559 --> 21:11.311
And plus I got me some of that.

21:11.395 --> 21:12.396
Damn.

21:49.850 --> 21:52.436
-<i>Sometimes the world
is cruel to shiny things.</i>
