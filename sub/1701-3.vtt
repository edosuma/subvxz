00:05.130 --> 00:06.922
- Hey.
- Hey.

00:07.173 --> 00:08.173
So how was Joan?

00:08.341 --> 00:09.341
Broke up with her.

00:09.843 --> 00:10.884
Oh, why?

00:11.136 --> 00:13.887
Don't tell me.
Because of the big nostril thing?

00:15.015 --> 00:16.807
They were huge.

00:17.684 --> 00:20.060
When she sneezed,
bats flew out of them.

00:21.021 --> 00:22.855
Come on, they were not that huge.

00:23.106 --> 00:26.358
I'm telling you, she leaned back,
I could see her brain.

00:28.319 --> 00:30.070
How many women will you reject...

00:30.280 --> 00:32.573
...over the most superficial,
insignificant things?

00:32.824 --> 00:35.492
Hold it. Hold it. I gotta side
with Chandler on this one.

00:35.744 --> 00:38.328
When I first moved to the city,
I went out with this girl.

00:38.580 --> 00:40.956
Really hot. Great kisser...

00:41.291 --> 00:44.334
...but she had the biggest
Adam's apple.

00:45.462 --> 00:46.587
Drove me nuts.

00:48.173 --> 00:50.799
- You or me?
- I got it.

00:51.009 --> 00:53.594
Joey, women don't have Adam's apples.

01:00.518 --> 01:03.520
Heh, heh.
You guys are messing with me, right?

01:05.397 --> 01:07.274
Yeah. We are.

01:08.401 --> 01:12.071
That's a good one.
For a second there, I was like, whoa!

01:59.994 --> 02:05.249
So you name one woman that you broke up
with for an actual real reason.

02:06.334 --> 02:07.417
Maureen Rasillo.

02:07.669 --> 02:10.336
Because she doesn't hate Yanni
is not a real reason.

02:15.802 --> 02:17.386
Hello, Mr. Heckles.

02:18.513 --> 02:19.596
You're doing it again.

02:20.181 --> 02:21.306
We're not doing anything.

02:21.558 --> 02:24.434
You're stomping.
It's disturbing my birds.

02:26.312 --> 02:28.856
You don't have birds.

02:29.440 --> 02:31.316
I could have birds.

02:32.277 --> 02:34.194
Okay, we'll try to keep it down.

02:34.445 --> 02:35.737
Thank you.

02:35.947 --> 02:38.448
I'm going to rejoin my dinner party.

02:39.284 --> 02:41.160
All right, bye-bye.

02:42.704 --> 02:43.704
Okay, Janice.

02:43.955 --> 02:46.832
You gotta give me Janice.
That wasn't about being picky.

02:47.041 --> 02:48.208
We'll give you Janice.

02:48.459 --> 02:50.335
I miss Janice, though.

02:50.628 --> 02:52.671
Hello, Chandler Bing!

02:54.924 --> 02:58.594
Oh, my God!

02:58.845 --> 03:00.429
Oh, Chandler!

03:00.680 --> 03:02.723
Now! Now!

03:05.143 --> 03:06.185
That's it.

03:07.103 --> 03:08.729
There! Faster!

03:16.446 --> 03:20.365
Ugh. Stop with the broom!
We're not making noise!

03:30.418 --> 03:31.585
We won.

03:31.794 --> 03:33.879
- We won! Whoo!
- Whoo!

03:36.633 --> 03:38.091
Mr. Heckles.

03:42.388 --> 03:44.806
- How did this happen?
- He was sweeping.

03:45.058 --> 03:47.267
They found a broom in his hand.

03:48.394 --> 03:50.395
- Oh.
- Oh, dear God.

03:50.563 --> 03:52.064
- That's terrible.
- I know.

03:52.523 --> 03:54.483
I was sweeping yesterday.

03:54.734 --> 03:57.236
- It could've been me.
- Yeah.

03:58.112 --> 04:00.197
- Sure.
- Sweeping. You never know.

04:00.406 --> 04:01.573
Never know.

04:05.245 --> 04:09.998
Okay, it's very faint, but I can
still sense him in the building.

04:10.792 --> 04:13.543
Go into the light, Mr. Heckles!

04:16.964 --> 04:18.339
Okay, Phoebe.

04:19.132 --> 04:21.301
I'm sorry,
but sometimes they need help.

04:23.012 --> 04:24.596
- Yeah.
- Here we go.

04:24.847 --> 04:27.307
That's fine, go ahead and scoff.

04:27.558 --> 04:30.018
There are a lot of things
I don't believe in...

04:30.270 --> 04:32.354
...but that doesn't mean
they're not true.

04:32.605 --> 04:33.772
Such as?

04:34.148 --> 04:38.652
Like crop circles or
the Bermuda Triangle or evolution.

04:38.861 --> 04:40.612
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

04:42.573 --> 04:44.825
What, you don't believe in evolution?

04:45.076 --> 04:46.285
No. Not really.

04:48.955 --> 04:50.455
You don't believe in evolution?

04:50.957 --> 04:53.083
I don't know.
It's just, you know...

04:53.334 --> 04:58.088
Monkeys, Darwin, it's a nice story.
I just think it's a little too easy.

05:01.509 --> 05:04.303
"Too easy"? Too...

05:04.512 --> 05:07.931
The process of every living thing
on this planet evolving...

05:08.141 --> 05:12.436
...over millions of years from
single-celled organisms is "too easy"?

05:13.271 --> 05:15.272
Yeah, I just don't buy it.

05:16.190 --> 05:20.402
Excuse me. Evolution is not
for you to buy, Phoebe.

05:20.653 --> 05:24.448
Evolution is scientific fact,
like the air we breathe...

05:24.699 --> 05:26.241
...like gravity.

05:26.451 --> 05:28.744
Okay, don't get me started on gravity.

05:32.832 --> 05:35.751
You, uh... You don't believe in gravity?

05:37.128 --> 05:41.173
Well, it's not so much that,
you know, I don't believe in it.

05:41.424 --> 05:43.300
Lately I get the feeling that...

05:43.509 --> 05:46.720
...I'm not so much being pulled down
as I am being pushed.

05:47.013 --> 05:48.055
Pushed.

05:50.391 --> 05:52.726
Uh-oh. It's Isaac Newton
and he's pissed.

05:55.938 --> 05:59.107
There she is. And over there,
that's the other one.

05:59.317 --> 06:01.610
This is Mr. Buddy Boyle,
Heckles' attorney.

06:01.819 --> 06:02.861
He'd like to talk to you.

06:03.321 --> 06:04.488
What can we do for you?

06:04.739 --> 06:06.782
All right, kids, here's the deal.

06:07.033 --> 06:09.076
According my client's will...

06:09.285 --> 06:13.789
...he wants to leave
all his earthly possessions...

06:14.040 --> 06:17.834
...to "the noisy girls
in the apartment above mine."

06:19.295 --> 06:20.504
What about his family?

06:20.755 --> 06:23.173
- He didn't have any.
- Whoa.

06:24.175 --> 06:26.385
Okay, so let's talk money.

06:28.221 --> 06:29.554
All right, there was none.

06:29.806 --> 06:31.431
Now, let's talk signing.

06:31.682 --> 06:34.851
You be noisy girl number one.
You be noisy girl number two.

06:36.479 --> 06:39.564
I can't believe that this whole time
we thought he hated us.

06:39.816 --> 06:43.318
Isn't it amazing how much
you can touch someone's life...

06:43.569 --> 06:45.529
...without even knowing it?

06:45.780 --> 06:47.239
Would you look at this dump?

06:47.448 --> 06:49.783
He hated us!
This was his final revenge!

06:50.034 --> 06:52.285
Ever seen so much crap!

06:52.537 --> 06:56.123
Actually, I think this apartment
sullies the good name of crap.

06:57.125 --> 06:58.708
Check this out.

07:00.711 --> 07:02.254
Can I have this?

07:03.673 --> 07:06.425
How can you not believe in evolution?

07:07.427 --> 07:10.387
I don't know, just don't.
Look at this funky shirt!

07:11.180 --> 07:14.057
Pheebs, I've studied evolution
my entire adult life.

07:14.308 --> 07:17.644
And I can tell you, we've collected fossils
from all over the world...

07:17.937 --> 07:21.356
...that actually show the evolution
of different species.

07:21.607 --> 07:24.359
I mean, you can literally see them...

07:24.569 --> 07:28.113
...evolving through time.

07:29.240 --> 07:31.283
Really? You can actually see it?

07:31.534 --> 07:36.121
You bet! In the U.S.,
China, Africa, all over!

07:36.873 --> 07:38.748
See, I didn't know that.

07:39.333 --> 07:41.460
Well, there you go.

07:41.627 --> 07:43.086
Huh.

07:43.254 --> 07:48.175
So now the real question is,
who put those fossils there and why?

07:51.012 --> 07:55.640
Hey. Look at this.
My Big Book of Grievances.

07:58.311 --> 07:59.811
Hey, there's me.

08:00.605 --> 08:03.356
"April 17th, excessive noise...

08:03.608 --> 08:07.027
...ltalian guy comes home with a date."
Yeah.

08:07.195 --> 08:08.612
Chandler, you're in here too.

08:09.155 --> 08:11.531
"April 18th, excessive noise...

08:11.782 --> 08:15.452
...ltalian guy's gay roommate
brings home dry cleaning."

08:22.418 --> 08:24.211
Well, that's excellent.

08:25.505 --> 08:26.880
Monica, look at this lamp.

08:27.089 --> 08:29.466
Is this tacky or what?
We have to have this.

08:30.676 --> 08:32.885
I think we have enough regular lamps.

08:33.136 --> 08:35.263
What? Come on, it's not like...

08:35.472 --> 08:38.183
...I'm asking for this
girlie clock or anything.

08:38.433 --> 08:41.311
Which, by the way,
I also think is really cool.

08:42.145 --> 08:44.564
Look, it doesn't go
with any of my stuff.

08:45.775 --> 08:47.484
Well, what about my stuff?

08:48.444 --> 08:49.778
You don't have any stuff.

08:51.072 --> 08:53.865
You still think of it
as your apartment, don't you?

08:54.033 --> 08:55.617
Mmm... No.

08:55.868 --> 08:56.952
Yes, you do.

08:57.203 --> 09:00.497
You think of it as your apartment
and I just rent a room.

09:01.791 --> 09:03.041
Mmm...

09:03.417 --> 09:07.462
Okay, while you "mmm" on that,
I'll go find a place for my new lamp.

09:10.800 --> 09:14.386
Okay, Pheebs. See how I'm making
these little toys move?

09:17.557 --> 09:18.598
Opposable thumbs!

09:20.601 --> 09:25.105
Without evolution, how do you
explain opposable thumbs?

09:26.023 --> 09:29.943
Maybe the Overlords needed them
to steer their spacecrafts.

09:31.320 --> 09:32.362
Tell me you're joking.

09:32.905 --> 09:36.825
Look, can't we just say that you believe
in something and I don't?

09:37.076 --> 09:39.786
- No. No, Pheebs, we can't.
- Why not?

09:40.037 --> 09:43.415
What is this obsessive need you have
to make everybody agree with you?

09:44.083 --> 09:46.710
No, what's that all about?
You know what I think?

09:47.169 --> 09:52.215
I think maybe it's time
you put Ross under the microscope.

09:56.554 --> 09:58.638
Is there blood coming out of my ears?

10:01.225 --> 10:03.893
Check it out.
Heckles' high-school yearbook.

10:05.396 --> 10:06.730
Wow. He looks so normal.

10:06.981 --> 10:08.982
He's even kind of cute.

10:09.191 --> 10:11.484
"Heckles, you crack me up
in science class.

10:11.736 --> 10:13.737
You're the funniest kid in school."

10:13.988 --> 10:16.281
- Funniest? Heckles?
- That's what it says.

10:17.533 --> 10:20.785
Wow. Heckles was voted class clown,
and so was I.

10:22.705 --> 10:24.956
He was right.
Would you listen to that?

10:25.166 --> 10:27.459
I'd call that excessive.

10:27.627 --> 10:29.252
- Whoa.
- What?

10:29.503 --> 10:32.422
Heckles played clarinet in band,
and I played clarinet.

10:33.090 --> 10:36.217
And he was in the scale
modeler's club and I was...

10:36.427 --> 10:39.554
Well, there was no club,
but I sure thought they were cool.

10:39.930 --> 10:42.265
So? You were both dorks.

10:42.683 --> 10:43.725
Big deal.

10:44.226 --> 10:46.311
I just think it's weird, you know?
Heckles and me...

10:48.064 --> 10:49.481
Heckles and me. Me...

10:49.940 --> 10:51.024
Me and Heckles.

10:51.525 --> 10:53.735
Hey, would you knock it off!

10:57.948 --> 10:59.115
Ah!

11:12.213 --> 11:13.421
Have you been here all night?

11:14.173 --> 11:15.465
Look at this.

11:16.050 --> 11:18.009
Pictures of all the women
Heckles went out with.

11:18.260 --> 11:21.930
Look what he wrote on them.
"Vivian, too tall."

11:22.181 --> 11:23.807
"Madge, big gums."

11:25.017 --> 11:26.059
"Too loud."

11:26.310 --> 11:28.395
"Too smart."
"Makes noise when she eats."

11:28.604 --> 11:30.271
This is me.

11:30.523 --> 11:32.357
This is what I do.

11:34.068 --> 11:36.486
I'm gonna end up alone,
just like he did.

11:36.737 --> 11:38.363
Chandler, Heckles was a nut case.

11:38.614 --> 11:40.532
Our trains are on the same track.

11:40.783 --> 11:44.285
I'm coming up 30 years behind him,
but the stops are all the same.

11:44.537 --> 11:46.121
Bitter Town...

11:46.539 --> 11:49.082
...Alone-ville, Hermit Junction!

11:50.710 --> 11:53.044
You know what we gotta do?
Get you out of here.

11:53.295 --> 11:54.963
Come on, I'll buy you breakfast.

11:55.214 --> 11:58.049
What if I never find somebody?
Or worse, what if I found her...

11:58.300 --> 12:02.178
...but I dumped her because
she pronounces it "supposably"?

12:02.888 --> 12:05.849
Chandler, come on,
you're gonna find somebody.

12:06.100 --> 12:08.059
How do you know that? How?

12:08.269 --> 12:10.937
I don't know. I'm just
trying to help you out.

12:12.022 --> 12:13.898
You guys will all get married...

12:14.150 --> 12:15.525
...and I'll end up alone.

12:16.360 --> 12:18.027
Will you promise me something?

12:18.279 --> 12:21.573
When you're married, will you
invite me over for holidays?

12:22.074 --> 12:23.700
I don't know what we'll be doing.

12:26.746 --> 12:29.914
I mean, what if we're over
at her folks' place?

12:32.168 --> 12:34.294
Yeah, I understand.

12:37.506 --> 12:39.924
You can come over
and watch the Super Bowl.

12:40.134 --> 12:42.051
Every year, all right?

12:43.304 --> 12:46.598
You know what?
I'm not gonna end up like this.

12:46.891 --> 12:48.683
I'll see you, man.

12:53.063 --> 12:54.230
Jeez.

12:58.360 --> 12:59.736
"Supposably."

13:02.490 --> 13:03.907
Supposably.

13:06.494 --> 13:08.787
Did they go to the zoo?

13:08.996 --> 13:11.206
Supposably.

13:23.761 --> 13:26.095
Hi. It's me.

13:26.555 --> 13:30.600
Oh, my God!

13:31.936 --> 13:34.145
Janice? You called Janice?

13:35.856 --> 13:36.981
Yes. Janice.

13:37.233 --> 13:39.150
Why is that difficult to comprehend?

13:39.401 --> 13:41.611
You remember Janice, right?

13:42.780 --> 13:47.325
Yes. She was smart, she was pretty
and she honestly cared about me.

13:47.576 --> 13:50.245
Janice is my last chance
to have somebody.

13:51.664 --> 13:53.248
Hello.

13:56.460 --> 13:59.379
Oh, my God!

14:01.549 --> 14:03.174
Jeez, look how fat she got.

14:05.219 --> 14:08.888
- Hey, it's everybody.
- Hi, Janice.

14:09.139 --> 14:10.306
Janice, you're...

14:10.558 --> 14:12.559
Yes, I am.

14:13.310 --> 14:15.186
- Is it...?
- Is it yours? Ha!

14:15.396 --> 14:17.438
You wish, Chandler Bing.

14:18.190 --> 14:22.110
You are looking at a married lady now.

14:22.403 --> 14:23.486
Oh.

14:23.654 --> 14:25.113
Yeah.

14:26.740 --> 14:28.575
Congratulations.

14:28.826 --> 14:31.119
Aw, sweetie, I'm sorry.

14:31.370 --> 14:33.246
You couldn't tell me on the phone?

14:33.497 --> 14:36.457
And what? Miss the expression
on your face? Oh, no.

14:36.667 --> 14:39.419
Janice likes to have her fun.

14:51.807 --> 14:53.850
You know what we haven't
played in a while?

14:54.059 --> 14:56.519
- What?
- Hide the lamp.

14:58.480 --> 15:00.231
Monica, let it go.

15:01.609 --> 15:03.401
Did you know
I'm allergic to shellfish?

15:03.652 --> 15:06.738
Then you'll just have
to eat the other lamps.

15:09.867 --> 15:12.493
Uh-oh. It's scary scientist man.

15:15.164 --> 15:16.873
Okay, Phoebe, this is it.

15:17.124 --> 15:20.835
In this briefcase I carry
actual scientific facts.

15:21.086 --> 15:23.796
A briefcase of facts, if you will.

15:25.925 --> 15:31.012
Some of these fossils are
over 200 million years old.

15:31.263 --> 15:34.474
Okay, look, before you even start,
I'm not denying evolution.

15:34.725 --> 15:36.768
It's just one of the possibilities.

15:37.019 --> 15:38.978
It's the only possibility.

15:39.229 --> 15:44.108
Ross, could you just open
your mind, like, this much? Okay?

15:44.401 --> 15:48.571
Wasn't there a time when the brightest minds
in the world believe the Earth was flat?

15:49.490 --> 15:54.077
And up till 50 years ago, you all thought
the atom was the smallest thing...

15:54.328 --> 15:58.039
...until you split it open
and this whole mess of crap came out.

15:59.500 --> 16:04.545
Now, are you telling me that you are
so unbelievably arrogant...

16:04.797 --> 16:08.591
...that you can't admit that
there's a teeny, tiny possibility...

16:08.801 --> 16:10.843
...that you could be wrong about this?

16:17.643 --> 16:19.519
There might be...

16:20.854 --> 16:22.647
...a teeny...

16:24.108 --> 16:25.191
...tiny...

16:26.860 --> 16:28.486
...possibility.

16:30.239 --> 16:32.448
I can't believe you caved.

16:34.076 --> 16:35.118
What?

16:35.369 --> 16:38.705
You just abandoned
your whole belief system!

16:40.040 --> 16:43.334
Before, I didn't agree with you,
but at least I respected you.

16:43.794 --> 16:45.044
But...

16:45.462 --> 16:47.714
How are you gonna go
into work tomorrow?

16:47.923 --> 16:50.675
How are you going to face
the other science guys?

16:50.884 --> 16:53.720
How are you going to face yourself?
Oh...

17:10.279 --> 17:12.320
That was fun.
So who's hungry?

17:12.573 --> 17:13.656
I am.

17:13.824 --> 17:15.825
Me too.
Let me just get my coat.

17:24.001 --> 17:25.585
What happened?

17:25.752 --> 17:28.671
Okay.
All right, it was an accident, I swear.

17:28.922 --> 17:32.842
I was putting on my jacket and
the thing and the lamp and it broke.

17:33.093 --> 17:36.471
Oh, please, Monica!
You've always hated my lamp!

17:36.722 --> 17:40.933
And now all of a sudden,
it's just magically, it's just broken?

17:41.185 --> 17:42.393
Phoebe, tell her?

17:42.644 --> 17:45.938
I didn't see it, because
I was putting on my jacket.

17:46.148 --> 17:47.482
But I want to believe you.

17:51.945 --> 17:55.865
Hey, Chandler. Monica just
broke my seashell lamp.

17:56.366 --> 17:57.533
Neat.

17:57.785 --> 17:59.619
I'm gonna die alone!

18:02.122 --> 18:04.165
Okay, you win.

18:05.042 --> 18:07.335
Chandler, you are not
gonna die alone.

18:07.961 --> 18:09.837
Janice was my safety net, okay?

18:10.089 --> 18:11.714
And now I have to get a snake.

18:13.467 --> 18:14.884
Uh-huh. Why is that?

18:15.135 --> 18:18.513
If I'm gonna be an old, lonely man,
I'm gonna need a thing.

18:18.764 --> 18:20.348
You know, a hook.

18:20.599 --> 18:23.601
Like that guy on the subway
who eats his own face.

18:24.311 --> 18:26.354
So I figure I'll be
"Crazy Man With A Snake."

18:26.605 --> 18:27.855
Crazy Snake Man.

18:28.107 --> 18:30.108
Then I'll get more snakes,
call them my babies.

18:30.359 --> 18:32.485
Kids won't walk past my place,
they will run!

18:32.736 --> 18:35.905
"Run away from Crazy Snake Man,"
they'll shout!

18:39.451 --> 18:41.953
You've got to get over this. Okay?

18:42.371 --> 18:43.788
You won't end up alone.

18:44.039 --> 18:45.581
Of course I am.

18:45.833 --> 18:49.544
I reject anyone who's crazy enough
to actually go out with me...

18:49.795 --> 18:53.422
...and then I bitch that there
aren't any great women out there.

18:54.800 --> 18:57.426
Chandler, you have just described...

18:57.636 --> 19:01.264
...virtually every man
that we've ever gone out with.

19:01.473 --> 19:02.932
Yeah.

19:03.183 --> 19:05.393
You are not a freak.
You're a guy.

19:07.020 --> 19:08.229
She's right.

19:08.480 --> 19:10.148
You're no different than the rest.

19:10.399 --> 19:12.608
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Yes, he is.

19:12.818 --> 19:14.610
You are totally different.

19:14.862 --> 19:15.862
In a bad way?

19:16.113 --> 19:17.864
No, honey, in a wonderful way.

19:18.115 --> 19:19.824
You know what you want now.

19:20.075 --> 19:21.617
Most guys don't even have a clue.

19:21.869 --> 19:25.663
You're ready to take risks, be
vulnerable and intimate with someone.

19:25.914 --> 19:27.456
You're not gonna end up alone.

19:28.709 --> 19:33.838
You called Janice. That's how much
you wanted to be with someone!

19:35.549 --> 19:37.466
- You've made it.
- You're there.

19:37.718 --> 19:40.136
You are ready to make a commitment!

19:40.387 --> 19:42.638
Whoa! Don't know about that.

19:50.022 --> 19:51.063
Wow. What you got there?

19:51.315 --> 19:54.483
Something else that's not yours
that you can break?

19:55.485 --> 19:56.986
No.

19:57.404 --> 20:00.364
I know you like this
and I want you to have it.

20:00.574 --> 20:02.575
It'll look good in our apartment.

20:03.785 --> 20:05.578
Thank you.

20:11.710 --> 20:13.336
That's fine.

20:14.588 --> 20:15.588
- Hey.
- Hey.

20:15.797 --> 20:19.592
You'll all be pleased to know
that I have a date tomorrow night.

20:19.760 --> 20:21.969
This woman Allison from work.
She is great.

20:22.221 --> 20:25.389
She's pretty, she's smart.
And I've been...

20:25.641 --> 20:28.935
...holding off asking her out
in the past, because she has a...

20:30.020 --> 20:31.520
...unusually large head.

20:33.065 --> 20:35.399
But I'm not going to let
that stuff hang me up anymore.

20:35.567 --> 20:36.651
All right.

20:36.818 --> 20:38.236
Look at me. I'm growing.

20:40.030 --> 20:42.698
Hey, you can't recycle yearbooks,
can you?

20:43.533 --> 20:44.700
I'll take that.

20:44.952 --> 20:46.077
You want his yearbook?

20:46.286 --> 20:50.665
Yeah. Yeah. Some people said nice things
about him. Somebody should have it.

20:50.916 --> 20:53.334
Gosh, this is so weird.

20:53.627 --> 20:56.879
His whole life was in
this apartment and now it's gone.

20:58.173 --> 21:02.510
I think it would be nice if we just
took a few moments for Mr. Heckles.

21:03.637 --> 21:07.473
I mean, he was kind of a pain.
He was, but he was a person.

21:09.309 --> 21:11.102
What?

21:14.273 --> 21:15.940
You're all going to hell.

21:16.191 --> 21:18.359
It's really not that big.

21:21.530 --> 21:23.781
- Taking that with you, huh?
- Oh, yeah.

21:29.871 --> 21:31.580
Hey, you coming?

21:32.207 --> 21:33.291
Yeah, in a second.

21:49.516 --> 21:51.517
Goodbye, Mr. Heckles.

21:54.813 --> 21:56.939
We'll try to keep it down.

22:07.951 --> 22:09.493
My major was useless.

22:09.745 --> 22:13.831
How often do you look in the classifieds
and see "Philosopher Wanted"?

22:14.041 --> 22:15.499
Heh, heh. Sure.

22:15.709 --> 22:18.002
My God, that's a big head!

22:19.880 --> 22:23.716
It didn't look this big in the office.
Maybe it's the lighting.

22:23.925 --> 22:27.178
My head must look
like a golf ball at work.

22:28.221 --> 22:32.016
Don't get hung up on it. Quick, quick.
List five things you like about her.

22:32.267 --> 22:34.226
Nice smile, good dresser.

22:34.436 --> 22:36.979
Big head, big head, big head!
