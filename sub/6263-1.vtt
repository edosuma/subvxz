17:15.951 --> 17:18.703
But don't worry, kids.
He's not the real Santa.

17:19.496 --> 17:23.290
How do we know?
Because Santa's reindeer can fly.

17:23.709 --> 17:25.376
(CAMERA CLICKING)

17:28.297 --> 17:29.297
Ten sticks of rock.

17:30.424 --> 17:32.467
As a matter of fact,
they're called candy canes.

17:33.761 --> 17:36.179
Ten sticks of rock.

17:38.515 --> 17:40.725
- Letters.
- Forty-one.

a letter like everyone else!

All right, lads, leave it out.

escape up the chimney?

18:11.381 --> 18:13.049
Eh? (CHUCKLING)

18:16.762 --> 18:20.056
Right, stop. This one. This one.

18:27.648 --> 18:29.591
I'd get changed if I was you.

18:29.691 --> 18:31.593
You can't keep me in here.

18:31.693 --> 18:33.069
Room not to your liking, sir?

18:33.570 --> 18:37.198
Oh, wait, I do apologise,
but all the sea-view rooms are taken.

18:37.866 --> 18:40.785
Officer, please,
this is very, very important.

18:40.953 --> 18:44.106
You have to let me out of here
or Christmas will be cancelled.

19:24.538 --> 19:27.775
Take me to see Santa or I'm not coming.

19:27.875 --> 19:29.458
That's the deal. Take it or leave it.

19:30.252 --> 19:31.752
I'll take it.

get rid of this old banger?

19:42.431 --> 19:44.724
Oh, now, now.
This old banger treated us well.

19:45.517 --> 19:47.935
- I made you both a packed lunch.
- Thank you.

19:48.604 --> 19:50.605
- Have fun.
- We will.

I'm sorry about last night.

Father Christmas?

20:12.878 --> 20:14.863
What do you say we swing by Harrods?

20:14.963 --> 20:16.631
Santa's in prison.

20:17.132 --> 20:20.702
What? No. No. We can't go and see
that old fruitcake from last night.

20:20.802 --> 20:21.870
He's not a fruitcake.

20:21.970 --> 20:24.248
Well, he's definitely a few fries short
of a Happy Meal.

20:24.348 --> 20:25.582
He's Santa.

20:25.682 --> 20:27.835
Look, Tom, I can't get us into prison
to go and see him.

20:27.935 --> 20:31.604
It's not possible. I'm sorry.
No, wait, wait, wait.

that he's not Father Christmas,

20:58.799 --> 21:02.093
can we just forget all of this
and have a nice day together? Mm?

(DOOR OPENS)

Oh.

21:14.022 --> 21:17.191
Thank you for coming.
This place is horrible.

21:17.317 --> 21:19.735
Yeah, well, it's not
a holiday camp, Nick.

21:20.988 --> 21:22.947
- You know my name.
- I worked it out.

21:23.365 --> 21:26.101
- How?
- Well, I thought of Saint Nicholas,

21:26.201 --> 21:28.452
and then I abbreviated it to Saint Nick.

21:28.787 --> 21:31.205
And then, I took away the "Saint".

21:31.373 --> 21:34.583
(CHUCKLES)
That's exactly how I came to it.

21:34.710 --> 21:36.153
Oh, wow! What do you know?

21:36.253 --> 21:39.297
I tried other more elaborate names,
but that one seemed to stick.

21:39.631 --> 21:42.550
- We've come to rescue you.
- Thank goodness.

21:42.843 --> 21:45.761
Yeah, we thought we'd free your
reindeer and fly in and pick you up.

21:46.138 --> 21:50.933
No, that wouldn't work because
the reindeer can't actually fly.

21:51.476 --> 21:55.021
I mean, not by themselves, but...
Well, it's complicated.

21:55.314 --> 21:58.592
But if you find the sleigh,
I mean, provided it's not broken,

21:58.692 --> 22:00.151
then you might be able to.

22:00.736 --> 22:02.403
Are you on medication?

22:03.655 --> 22:06.183
Or worse, are you not on medication?

22:06.283 --> 22:07.742
Ho, ho, ho!

22:08.076 --> 22:10.619
- You still don't believe I'm Santa.
- Do you wanna know why?

22:11.413 --> 22:14.457
- Because I'm 30.
- But once you were seven.

22:14.666 --> 22:17.752
Yeah, and I saw a shooting star.
Tell me something I don't know.

22:18.920 --> 22:21.255
It was an exceptionally cold
Christmas night.

22:22.549 --> 22:24.216
Your parents were drunk.
They'd been rowing.

22:24.426 --> 22:27.428
- My parents got divorced.
- This was their last Christmas together.

22:28.638 --> 22:31.724
You ran out into the back garden.
You were crying.

22:32.559 --> 22:34.894
You heard a noise
in the skies above you.

22:36.021 --> 22:39.106
The sound of bells, sleigh bells,
and that's when you saw me.

22:40.108 --> 22:41.802
You knew it wasn't a shooting star.

22:41.902 --> 22:45.154
That's just what your mother told you.
But you had proof.

22:46.740 --> 22:49.351
You found a gift in the garden,
a gift that I had left for you.

22:49.451 --> 22:51.619
What was it? Do you remember?

22:52.412 --> 22:53.981
Why don't you tell me?

22:54.081 --> 22:56.290
It was the most popular gift
of that year.

22:57.292 --> 22:58.793
A Rubik's cube.

22:59.586 --> 23:01.170
You still have it, don't you?

23:01.421 --> 23:03.464
Not because of me. Oh, no.

23:04.341 --> 23:07.968
No, you kept it because that was
the last family Christmas you ever had.

23:09.971 --> 23:11.806
How do you know that?

23:12.307 --> 23:14.016
Because he's Santa.

23:14.810 --> 23:16.936
Deep in your heart, you know who I am.

23:18.105 --> 23:20.856
Deep in my heart, you're a nutbag.

23:22.401 --> 23:23.859
(CHUCKLING)

23:25.404 --> 23:29.323
The reindeer have been moved
to a private area in Richmond Park.

23:29.449 --> 23:31.617
Go there. Seek out Dasher.

23:31.952 --> 23:33.702
He knows what to do.

23:34.037 --> 23:36.330
- Dasher speaks?
- He communicates.

23:36.456 --> 23:38.290
Right, that's it,
I've had enough of this.

23:38.417 --> 23:40.918
We haven't seen each other
in a very long time, Okay?

23:41.044 --> 23:44.239
And I wouldn't ask this if it wasn't
the most important job in the world.

23:44.339 --> 23:46.215
- Come on, we're going.
- We had a deal.

23:46.425 --> 23:49.343
What, you wanna spend our day
looking for a talking reindeer?

23:49.678 --> 23:52.012
- Yes.
- Okay, then, that's what we'll do.

23:52.139 --> 23:54.014
- Thank you.
- No, thank you.

23:54.266 --> 23:56.016
- Come on.
- One more thing.

23:57.436 --> 23:59.645
How do I survive in this place?

23:59.771 --> 24:02.106
Erm, stop pretending
to be Father Christmas.

24:02.315 --> 24:03.482

24:04.359 --> 24:05.568
Go and see the barber.

24:05.902 --> 24:08.112
- Er, I can't change my look.
- For advice.

24:09.531 --> 24:11.115
Tell him I sent you.

24:16.037 --> 24:17.288
(BUZZING)

24:25.046 --> 24:27.256
Excuse me. Are you the barber?

24:27.716 --> 24:30.676
- No, I'm the vet.
- They keep animals here?

24:31.386 --> 24:33.888
Yeah, they keep
all sorts of animals in here.

24:34.014 --> 24:35.890
Do they keep reindeer?

24:36.475 --> 24:39.393
- Are you trying to be funny?
- No, I'm trying to find the barber.

24:39.811 --> 24:41.979
It's pretty obvious
I'm the barber, isn't it?

24:42.355 --> 24:44.732
Steve Anderson said
you'd be able to help me.

24:45.358 --> 24:48.068
- You know Steve?
- I know Steve very well.

24:49.029 --> 24:50.347
- Do one.
- Eh?

24:50.447 --> 24:51.655
Do one.

24:54.701 --> 24:56.645
Any friend of Steve's a friend of mine.

24:56.745 --> 25:01.290
Oh, that's great news!
A friend is exactly what I need.

25:01.708 --> 25:03.584
What can I do for you?

25:04.127 --> 25:06.670
Well, it's rather a long story.

25:07.464 --> 25:10.424
Take a seat, pops.
The one thing we've got in here is time.

25:10.675 --> 25:15.137
Well, I was born in Lapland
a long time ago.

25:15.805 --> 25:17.749
Neighbourhood I grew up in
was a small town

25:17.849 --> 25:20.267
in the Laughing Valley of Hohaho.

25:20.602 --> 25:22.796
Although my childhood was happy,

25:22.896 --> 25:27.441
one day an old woodcutter told me
about all the poverty in the world.

25:27.943 --> 25:31.362
And I was so shocked
that I went straight to Elf City.

25:31.780 --> 25:35.282
Now, the elves are wonderful
toy makers, as you know.

25:36.034 --> 25:38.327
So I went there with a mission,

25:38.620 --> 25:41.622
that on Christmas morning,
from that day forth,

25:41.831 --> 25:43.958
every child would get a toy.

25:44.709 --> 25:47.836
I know what you're thinking.
Where do the reindeer come in?

25:48.547 --> 25:50.965
STEVE: Right, so there's six reindeer,

25:51.466 --> 25:54.176
and they all look like, er, reindeer.

25:55.554 --> 25:59.014
None of them appear to be talking,
but... No, hang on, one second.

26:01.017 --> 26:03.211
Oh, no, he's just eating grass.

26:03.311 --> 26:05.813
Why are you acting like an idiot, Steve?

26:06.189 --> 26:09.468
You know, it wouldn't hurt you
to call me Dad once in a while,

26:09.568 --> 26:11.527
'Cause, like it or lump it,
that's what I am.

26:11.903 --> 26:13.153
Lump it.

26:14.656 --> 26:17.992
You're not going over the fence.
Get off the fence.

26:18.243 --> 26:21.120
Oi, you're not climbing over the fence.

26:22.664 --> 26:26.709
Right, that's it, mister. Me and you
are now officially no longer friends.

26:28.587 --> 26:31.072
So, as we speak, Steve and his son Tom

26:31.172 --> 26:33.575
are rescuing my head reindeer, Dasher,

26:33.675 --> 26:35.994
who will then lead them
to my new magic sleigh.

26:36.094 --> 26:39.179
They will then be able to fly in
and spring me from prison.

26:40.599 --> 26:43.684
Well, me first advice is
don't tell anyone about this.

26:44.019 --> 26:45.545
- Yeah, not in here.
- Okay.

26:45.645 --> 26:47.714
In fact, I think it might be better

26:47.814 --> 26:49.857
if we create a whole
new back story for you.

26:49.983 --> 26:52.761
You know, one where you won't end up
in a psychiatric unit.

26:52.861 --> 26:55.654
- You don't think they'll believe me?
- I'm positive they won't.

26:56.364 --> 27:00.868
So instead of "Santa Claus",
let's pretend your name's,

27:01.870 --> 27:05.039
I don't know, something like
Mad Jimmy Claws.

27:05.415 --> 27:09.376
You're a veteran safe cracker,
bank robber, all-round bad guy.

27:10.003 --> 27:11.587
Mad Jimmy Claws?

27:12.047 --> 27:13.839
Yeah. Do you like it?

27:14.090 --> 27:16.258
- I think it's horrible.
- It's supposed to be.

27:19.471 --> 27:21.388
Show me your gangster face.

27:21.556 --> 27:23.807
- My what?
- Your mean face.

27:24.768 --> 27:26.044
Hmm?

27:26.144 --> 27:27.963
Now, if you're gonna be
Mad Jimmy Claws, you've gotta be...

27:28.063 --> 27:30.397
- Mad.
- No, not mad crazy.

27:30.857 --> 27:32.107
Just mean.

27:32.442 --> 27:33.442
Mean.

27:34.110 --> 27:37.279
- No, mean.
- Mean.

27:38.239 --> 27:39.698
Don't ever do that again.

27:41.576 --> 27:45.162
Okay, so, Dasher, if you are here,

27:45.914 --> 27:48.832
your boss wants us
to spring him from prison,

27:49.584 --> 27:52.628
and he says that you would
know what to do.

27:59.260 --> 28:01.428
- Nothing.
- He might be shy.

28:01.596 --> 28:03.347
Or he might be a reindeer
that doesn't speak.

28:04.891 --> 28:07.434
Dasher, we're your friends.

28:07.811 --> 28:09.879
We're not going to hurt you.

That you'd build me up with promises
and then let me down.

- He's got previous.

57:11.386 --> 57:13.971
Arrested in Bradford
on a burglary charge.

57:14.931 --> 57:16.390
He's some sort of scam man.

57:16.724 --> 57:19.351
They've got him on temporary lockdown
in his cell while they run checks.

57:20.145 --> 57:23.313
Give up on this joker, lad,
before you wind up back in here.

57:24.732 --> 57:25.858
Take care.

57:32.699 --> 57:33.740
What's happened?

57:38.037 --> 57:39.204
He's not Santa.

57:39.706 --> 57:41.206
- Yes, he is.
- He's not.

57:41.708 --> 57:43.735
But what about the sleigh? And Dasher?

57:43.835 --> 57:45.320
And all the stuff he knew about you?

57:45.420 --> 57:47.280
I don't know. Some sort of weird trick.

57:47.380 --> 57:49.657
- It's not, Dad.
- Look, look around you, Son.

57:49.757 --> 57:54.094
It's not Santa's grotto.
It's some sort of a water tower.

57:54.762 --> 57:55.971
What about the book?

57:57.557 --> 57:58.807
What about it?

57:59.184 --> 58:01.059
I don't know.
Maybe we're in the wrong place.

58:01.227 --> 58:02.603
Maybe there's another tower.

58:03.813 --> 58:05.147
Okay, listen to me, Tom.

58:05.648 --> 58:07.357
I'm in a great deal
of trouble, all right?

58:08.234 --> 58:11.403
The sooner we call off this whole
search thing, the better it'll be for me.

58:14.532 --> 58:15.532
(EXHALES)

58:16.242 --> 58:17.242
Thank you.

58:18.411 --> 58:20.412

have Harry Mitchell in his cell.

58:21.206 --> 58:24.317
- They obviously trust your instincts.
- Well, I'm glad somebody does.

58:24.417 --> 58:27.737
Well, maybe I do owe you
an apology. (CHUCKLES)

58:27.837 --> 58:29.447
Hmm, that's very gracious of you.

58:29.547 --> 58:33.592
We don't have to be friends
for me to admire your wisdom.

58:34.594 --> 58:38.055
Find Steve Anderson
and we can all let our hair down.

(MOBILE RINGING)

58:42.852 --> 58:44.019
Well, well, well.

58:45.939 --> 58:47.006
Steve.

58:47.106 --> 58:48.941
STEVE: All right, just listen to me
or I'm ringing off.

58:49.859 --> 58:51.944
I didn't hit that policeman,
all right, in the van.

58:52.820 --> 58:53.862
It was Dasher.

58:54.906 --> 58:56.114
I mean, it was a reindeer.

58:56.282 --> 58:57.991
As far as I'm concerned,

58:58.117 --> 59:00.410
all you've done is miss
a parole meeting.

59:01.454 --> 59:02.564
You're not gonna send me back to prison?

59:02.664 --> 59:04.289
I won't send you back to prison.

59:07.293 --> 59:11.463
All right, we're, well, we're at a place
called Hermey's Tower in Suffolk.

59:11.839 --> 59:13.298
We'll wait for you here, all right?

59:15.635 --> 59:17.261
You're not sending him back to prison?

59:17.887 --> 59:18.971
No.

59:20.848 --> 59:21.974
You are.

59:24.852 --> 59:26.144
Santa.

59:26.729 --> 59:27.938
Barber!

59:29.315 --> 59:31.567
You've got to help me.
You've got to call Steve.

59:31.901 --> 59:34.278
I just spoke to him.
He's through with you.

59:34.779 --> 59:36.780
Steve would never give up on Christmas.

59:37.156 --> 59:39.116
Steve knows all about Harry Mitchell.

59:40.118 --> 59:41.159
Who?

59:42.036 --> 59:43.161
BARBER: You know who.

59:43.830 --> 59:48.125
Now, listen, you're getting a very
good friend of mine in a lot of trouble.

59:48.501 --> 59:49.710
And that can't happen.

59:50.086 --> 59:51.587
Do you understand me?

59:53.965 --> 59:56.075
SANTA: Barber, it's Christmas Eve!

59:56.175 --> 59:58.427
- You have to help me!
- INMATE: Shut it!

59:58.553 --> 01:00:00.679
Why would someone lie
about something like this?

01:00:02.640 --> 01:00:04.751
I don't know.
Sometimes adults like to tell fibs.

01:00:04.851 --> 01:00:07.185
Yeah, but not about something
as big as this.

01:00:11.274 --> 01:00:13.426
Do you remember the last time
I saw you and I told you a story?

01:00:13.526 --> 01:00:14.594
It was a spaceman story

01:00:14.694 --> 01:00:18.071
about an astronaut going on a long
and dangerous mission to Mars,

01:00:18.781 --> 01:00:21.434
and the only thing
to keep him going on this mission

01:00:21.534 --> 01:00:23.368
was the love that he had for his son.

01:00:24.495 --> 01:00:26.330
And I told you that story for a reason.

01:00:28.458 --> 01:00:30.542
You didn't want me to forget you.

01:00:31.377 --> 01:00:34.338
You wanted me to know that
someday you'd be a good dad.

01:00:36.174 --> 01:00:39.009
You are a good dad. The best.

01:00:39.802 --> 01:00:42.721
But that still doesn't explain
why Santa would lie.

01:00:44.098 --> 01:00:48.268
Well, I don't know. I mean, sometimes
people like to tell stories, you know?

01:00:48.394 --> 01:00:51.297
Maybe he just likes to tell people
that he's Santa Claus,

01:00:51.397 --> 01:00:53.565
flying around the world on his sleigh.

01:01:01.282 --> 01:01:02.475
TOM: It's the sky!

01:01:02.575 --> 01:01:03.742
What is?

01:01:04.535 --> 01:01:06.854
That's the North Star.

01:01:06.954 --> 01:01:07.954
This is the Plough.

01:01:11.376 --> 01:01:13.418
So that... That's the North Star.

01:01:14.587 --> 01:01:16.546
Look, it's... It's a code.

01:01:18.758 --> 01:01:20.717
So, if I move this to here

01:01:21.636 --> 01:01:25.472
and this to here...

This is instructions.

01:01:56.963 --> 01:01:59.214
And that's not a tower.
It's a letter box.

01:01:59.549 --> 01:02:02.134
This must be one of the routes
for the letters to get to Lapland.

01:02:16.774 --> 01:02:19.260
This must be a slide
for Santa to get to Lapland.

01:02:19.360 --> 01:02:21.903
You can't take a slide all the way
to Lapland. It would take weeks.

01:02:22.155 --> 01:02:23.806
- Well, let's go down it.
- Oh, no, we won't.

that Santa has failed to deliver?

for all of us, I hope this is not true.

- Then there must be an old sleigh.
- ENTWHISTLE: Yes.

we explode.
