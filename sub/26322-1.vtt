It's delicious, would you
like a bite?

31:52.626 --> 31:55.129
No, thank you.

31:59.365 --> 32:03.267
So I hear you're from Great
Neck.

32:03.269 --> 32:05.270
- I am.
- That's cool.

32:05.272 --> 32:07.641
Not really, it's pretty much
the opposite.

32:11.344 --> 32:12.579
Oh, shit!

32:14.515 --> 32:17.381
- ANT: Oh, shit!
- GIO: Fuck yeah!

32:17.383 --> 32:19.850
Lennie!

32:19.852 --> 32:21.418
- You like baseball?
- I do.

32:21.420 --> 32:24.688
- All right, good girl.
- Yankees all the way!

32:24.690 --> 32:26.558
What the fuck, Yankees?

32:26.560 --> 32:28.526
- Get the fuck outta here!
- Yankees suck!

32:28.528 --> 32:32.196
- Don Mattingly, baby!
- What a bunch of fuckin' scrubs.

32:32.198 --> 32:34.198
Ooh, Dan Pasqua, Bobby Meacham.

32:34.200 --> 32:35.399
At least they're not a bunch
of cokeheads.

32:35.401 --> 32:36.834
- Excuse me.
- What'd you just say?

32:36.836 --> 32:38.703
- Gooden, Hernandez, Strawberry...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

32:38.705 --> 32:40.338
Mookie Wilson? You're telling
me Mookie does blow?

32:40.340 --> 32:43.175
- Mookie's clean, man.
- Fine, one guy.

32:43.177 --> 32:45.409
Don Mattingly, he fuckin' sucks
off donkeys.

32:45.411 --> 32:47.545
I don't think he does.

32:47.547 --> 32:49.747
Now, Gary Carter on the
other hand...

32:49.749 --> 32:51.518
Whoa, whoa!

32:57.690 --> 32:59.323
I mean she was hot, but not
enough...

32:59.325 --> 33:01.326
to get me to sit through
fuckin' "Dirty Dancing".

33:01.328 --> 33:02.894
Fuckin' Heather Locklear
couldn't get me...

33:02.896 --> 33:04.329
to sit through that shit.

33:04.331 --> 33:05.763
I saw it and I actually
liked it.

33:05.765 --> 33:08.766
Says the person with the vagina.

33:08.768 --> 33:10.368
What's the damage?

33:10.370 --> 33:11.468
Like nine, ten each.

33:11.470 --> 33:13.671
But you got the French Dip.

33:13.673 --> 33:15.175
All right.

33:28.621 --> 33:31.356
Gold card.

33:31.358 --> 33:35.630
From my dad, he wants me to
start building credit.

33:40.266 --> 33:42.300
- I got you.
- You sure?

33:42.302 --> 33:44.438
- Absolutely.
- Thanks.

33:57.817 --> 34:00.651
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

34:00.653 --> 34:02.856
- Nice to meet you.
- You, too.

34:05.025 --> 34:06.657
He's so cute.

34:06.659 --> 34:08.359
- Who? Anthony?
- Yeah.

34:08.360 --> 34:10.027
- He gets all ladies.
- Yeah?

34:10.030 --> 34:11.829
- Yeah.
- I like his car.

34:11.831 --> 34:13.898
He's got it says "Greek God"
on the license plate.

34:13.900 --> 34:16.501
Because he's a Greek god.

34:16.503 --> 34:17.900
CARBONE: Yo.

34:17.902 --> 34:19.570
What's up?

34:19.572 --> 34:20.670
C'mere.

34:20.672 --> 34:22.606
What do you want?

34:22.608 --> 34:23.976
C'mere.

34:26.380 --> 34:27.380
Be right back.

34:29.581 --> 34:30.849
What?

34:30.851 --> 34:32.753
What the fuck?

34:35.389 --> 34:37.521
Check it.

34:37.523 --> 34:40.291
No stealing at the diner,
strict rule.

34:40.293 --> 34:42.893
EX-550, on a plate.

34:42.896 --> 34:44.396
I got...

34:44.398 --> 34:45.929

34:45.931 --> 34:48.065
I don't want her to...

34:48.068 --> 34:49.335
See what you do?

34:54.706 --> 34:55.775
Fast.

35:02.048 --> 35:03.481
Let's go.

35:03.483 --> 35:05.050
Must be some kind of release.

35:05.052 --> 35:06.586
Dude, hurry the fuck up.

35:07.653 --> 35:09.990
Okay, scoot over, Jesus Christ!

35:11.525 --> 35:12.793
Got it.

35:14.394 --> 35:16.363
Son of a bitch.

35:16.863 --> 35:18.363
Minchia!

35:18.365 --> 35:19.830
Gotcha, bitch.

35:19.832 --> 35:22.336
JESSICA: Gio, I left my lip
gloss in the diner.

35:24.570 --> 35:25.706
What are you doing?

35:27.407 --> 35:30.010
- We were just, uh...
- Stealing a radio.

35:33.680 --> 35:37.015
What? It's what we do.

35:37.017 --> 35:38.986
We steal car radios.

35:44.590 --> 35:46.691
I'm sorry.

35:46.693 --> 35:48.329
You never should've seen that.

35:50.997 --> 35:52.867
My dad got his radio stolen...

35:54.735 --> 35:56.003
I wonder if you took it.

35:59.005 --> 36:00.671
Is that what you were doing
in Great Neck?

36:00.673 --> 36:02.709
Look, Jess...

36:04.077 --> 36:05.579
So how does it work?

36:07.381 --> 36:08.713
How does what work?

36:08.715 --> 36:10.084
Stealing radios.

36:13.887 --> 36:15.589
You're asking me how it works?

36:16.923 --> 36:19.490
For our next date.

36:19.492 --> 36:20.927
Show me.

36:23.430 --> 36:25.095
You got your Becker, your
Alpine and your Blaupunkt.

36:25.097 --> 36:26.765
Those are the Big Three, okay?

36:26.767 --> 36:28.932
BMWs come factory with
Blaupunkt.

36:28.934 --> 36:31.602
You see a Beemer, there's gonna
be a Blaupunkt inside.

36:31.604 --> 36:33.070
Same with Mercedes and the
Becker.

36:33.072 --> 36:34.805
So those are the two
you look for?

36:34.807 --> 36:36.874
Not necessarily.

36:36.876 --> 36:39.644
They're worth a lot, but they're
kind of a pain in the ass.

36:39.646 --> 36:41.780
You gotta rip 'em out,
wires and all.

36:41.782 --> 36:43.148
Benzis, you just grab
and go.

36:43.150 --> 36:46.417
- The pull-outs.
- Yeah.

36:46.419 --> 36:47.785
Don't people take those
with 'em?

36:47.787 --> 36:50.988
Nine times out of ten,
they're under the seat.

36:50.990 --> 36:52.590
So Benzi's the way to go.

36:52.592 --> 36:54.492
But you don't know what
you're gonna get.

36:54.494 --> 36:56.727
Bust into a Saab with a hole
in the dash...

36:56.729 --> 36:58.762
there could be a Kenwood
under the driver seat...

36:58.764 --> 37:00.597
or it could be
some piece-of-shit Delco.

37:00.599 --> 37:02.434
Fuckin' radio roulette.

37:02.436 --> 37:04.169
Do nice cars ever have shit
radios?

37:04.171 --> 37:06.738
Ooh, all the time, and the
reverse...

37:06.740 --> 37:09.573
you could see some piece of shit
Gremlin with a Nakamichi in it.

37:09.575 --> 37:10.941
Nakamichi, that's good?

37:10.943 --> 37:13.111
That's the magic, purple
unicorn.

37:13.113 --> 37:14.812
This is wild.

37:14.814 --> 37:17.515
So, like, how do you break in?

37:17.517 --> 37:20.050
Metal bar, slips right
in the door.

37:20.052 --> 37:22.620
- You don't smash the window?
- That's for amateurs.

37:22.622 --> 37:24.789
- What if an alarm goes off?
- You run.

37:24.791 --> 37:26.890
- Have you ever been caught?
- Never.

37:26.892 --> 37:28.827
- Would you go to jail?
- Not for long.

37:28.829 --> 37:30.528
Oh, my god.

37:30.530 --> 37:32.600
All right, let's do it.

37:40.673 --> 37:42.543
Right.

37:44.644 --> 37:46.947
You see a "No Radio" sign,
you know what that means?

37:48.048 --> 37:49.082
Radio.

37:53.820 --> 37:56.521
Wait, give it to me.

37:56.523 --> 37:58.957
You said you were gonna show me
how it's done.

37:58.959 --> 38:02.760
- Show you.
- I wanna do it.

38:02.762 --> 38:05.599
- Are you serious?
- Give me the fucking bar.

38:06.900 --> 38:11.135
All right. Feel it.

38:11.137 --> 38:13.671
Listen.

38:13.673 --> 38:14.809
Hook it.

38:18.577 --> 38:21.215
It's okay, I'm your lookout.

38:24.017 --> 38:27.017
It's not here, there is nothing.

38:27.019 --> 38:29.754
Check under the passenger seat.

38:29.756 --> 38:31.789
- They must've taken it.
- Pop the trunk.

38:31.791 --> 38:34.925
- How?
- Left, by the brights.

38:34.927 --> 38:35.996
Okay.

38:44.838 --> 38:47.070
- Panasonic 410.
- Is that good?

38:47.072 --> 38:48.840
It's a nice deck.

38:48.842 --> 38:51.642
So, now what?

38:51.644 --> 38:53.544
You take it.

get me a studio...

- Jean-Michel Basquiat.

42:54.354 --> 42:58.555
Oh, we are covering it
all today.

42:58.557 --> 43:01.892
Jean-Michel. What is he, French?

43:01.894 --> 43:03.827
He's Haitian, he's from
Brooklyn.

43:03.829 --> 43:05.329
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

43:05.331 --> 43:08.265
He was a graffiti kid,
dropped out of high school.

43:08.267 --> 43:10.334
Sounds familiar.

43:10.336 --> 43:13.937
Maybe you're in training to be
the next great artist.

43:13.939 --> 43:16.140
Except I can't paint for shit.

43:16.142 --> 43:18.376
Not that that stopped him.

43:18.378 --> 43:22.146
Picasso said it took him four
years to paint like Raphael...

43:22.148 --> 43:24.015
but a lifetime to paint
like a child.

43:24.017 --> 43:27.151

needs some fuckin' lessons.
