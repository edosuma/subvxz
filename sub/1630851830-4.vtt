WEBVTT

00:04.040 --> 00:06.800
I can see everything quite clearly.

00:07.960 --> 00:10.400
It has a stark beauty all its own.

00:19.200 --> 00:20.920
Magnificent desolation.

00:22.600 --> 00:25.000
- Beautiful view.
- Isn't that something?

00:43.800 --> 00:46.120
The Milky Way
seems a tranquil place...

00:51.640 --> 00:57.120
Hundreds of billions of stars
serenely spinning through the cosmos.

01:02.640 --> 01:06.560
But journey inwards through
the gas and dust

01:06.640 --> 01:08.960
that shrouds the galactic core,

01:13.040 --> 01:15.080
and you'd see a curious sight...

01:20.960 --> 01:25.640
Stars orbiting seemingly empty space.

01:29.240 --> 01:32.680
Something dark and ancient lives here...

01:34.560 --> 01:37.880
a hole in the fabric of the universe.

02:04.720 --> 02:07.880
Every one of those points
of light in the night sky

02:07.960 --> 02:10.360
is a strange and fascinating place.

02:12.360 --> 02:15.920
Magnificent suns with countless planets
orbiting around them,

02:16.000 --> 02:19.320
alien worlds beyond imagination.

02:19.400 --> 02:24.040
But the strangest and most fascinating
places out there, by far,

02:24.120 --> 02:26.440
are dark and unseen.

02:36.080 --> 02:39.840
An invisible monster is lurking
in the centre of the Milky Way,

02:48.240 --> 02:52.120
a monster that drains
the colour from the universe,

02:56.520 --> 02:58.880
with the power to destroy worlds,

03:03.960 --> 03:06.160
and stop time.

03:24.240 --> 03:27.640
We've named the monster Sagittarius A%

03:28.720 --> 03:31.320
and we believe it to be a black hole.

03:37.800 --> 03:43.200
Sagittarius A* has played a major role
in the evolution of our galaxy

03:43.280 --> 03:44.560
and may even have influenced

03:44.640 --> 03:47.840
the formation of stars
and planets like ours.

03:48.520 --> 03:53.720
But there is so much more.
Because black holes like Sagittarius A*

03:53.800 --> 03:57.240
present the most
profound intellectual challenge.

03:58.040 --> 04:01.560
They are part of nature,
just like you and me.

04:01.680 --> 04:04.200
So, we should be
able to understand them.

04:04.280 --> 04:07.960
But they are holes
in the fabric of the universe.

04:08.040 --> 04:13.400
They are gravitational prisons from
which even light itself can't escape.

04:13.920 --> 04:17.400
But in trying to understand them,
physicists have been led

04:17.480 --> 04:22.640
to completely reassess
our most basic understanding of reality.

04:25.960 --> 04:32.200
But there are answers hiding in the void
for those brave enough to seek them.

05:16.240 --> 05:18.360
And we copy
at go for deploy.

05:24.840 --> 05:26.600
You look out and this thing is so big,

05:26.680 --> 05:29.960
you certainly know that it's
moving over the head of the shuttle.

05:32.200 --> 05:34.000
In the summer of 1999,

05:34.360 --> 05:37.560
NASA's flagship mission
for X-ray astronomy

05:37.640 --> 05:40.120
was released from the shuttle cargo bay.

05:44.960 --> 05:46.840
There is nothing as beautiful

05:46.920 --> 05:49.520
as Chandra sailing off
on its way to work.

05:55.040 --> 05:58.640
High above
the earth, Chandra scanned the sky

06:00.000 --> 06:02.800
hunting for some of
the hottest regions in the universe,

06:05.000 --> 06:08.400
exploding stars
and clusters of galaxies.

06:18.200 --> 06:21.000
But on September 14, 2013,

06:21.480 --> 06:26.200
after 14 years, Chandra chanced
on something else entirely.

06:35.120 --> 06:39.240
The telescope gazed into
the constellation of Sagittarius,

06:39.320 --> 06:42.160
hoping to observe
a large cloud of hot gas.

06:57.040 --> 07:02.400
Instead, it recorded a flash of X-rays,
Just a few pixels across,

07:04.800 --> 07:09.200
coming from the apparently empty space
in the galactic core.

07:16.440 --> 07:21.920
Something had got very hot
for a very short period of time.

07:34.280 --> 07:37.360
It's thought that the flash
seen by Chandra

07:37.440 --> 07:41.560
may have been an asteroid
tens of kilometres across,

07:56.280 --> 08:00.080
ripped apart
and burning up in a fireball

08:00.160 --> 08:03.440
300 times brighter than the sun.

08:11.440 --> 08:15.360
The culprit, Sagittarius A.

08:22.320 --> 08:26.160
The asteroid's destruction
was our galaxy's black hole

08:26.960 --> 08:29.640
signalling its presence to the world.

08:44.320 --> 08:47.200
Twenty years ago,
we didn't know for sure

08:47.280 --> 08:49.920
that there is a black hole
at the centre of our galaxy.

08:50.320 --> 08:54.320
But by measuring bursts of radiation
and observing in detail

08:54.400 --> 08:57.360
the orbits of stars
close to the galactic centre,

08:57.440 --> 09:02.160
we now know that
Sagittarius A* definitely exists,

09:02.240 --> 09:04.800
and we've been able to measure its mass.

09:04.880 --> 09:08.800
It is around four million times
the mass of our sun,

09:08.880 --> 09:11.160
which makes it
a supermassive black hole,

09:11.240 --> 09:15.920
one of the strangest and
most powerful objects in the universe.

09:16.440 --> 09:20.360
And we've begun to suspect
that Sagittarius A* isn't just

09:20.440 --> 09:22.240
some strange thing that sits

09:22.320 --> 09:25.720
tens of thousands of light years
from Earth, at the centre of the galaxy.

09:26.320 --> 09:30.960
It has played a crucial role
in the evolution of the Milky Way,

09:31.040 --> 09:36.160
and the whole story began
with the death of one massive star.

09:53.680 --> 09:55.520
Soon after the dawn of time,

09:59.240 --> 10:01.960
the cosmos was home to colossal stars,

10:07.920 --> 10:10.800
hundreds of times
more massive than the sun,

10:13.080 --> 10:17.040
stars that burnt blue in intense heat.

10:24.000 --> 10:27.120
But the brightest stars
are the shortest lived.

10:34.520 --> 10:37.720
One lived a particularly fast
and furious life,

10:41.400 --> 10:45.200
burning through its nuclear fuel
in just a few million years.

10:56.840 --> 11:01.200
And with nothing left in the tank,
gravity took over.

11:02.760 --> 11:04.720
The star collapsed...

11:06.000 --> 11:09.360
ever smaller, ever denser...

11:12.120 --> 11:14.400
until it seemingly disappeared.

11:16.160 --> 11:20.560
The remnants of the star,
now smaller than an atom,

11:21.680 --> 11:23.720
lost from the universe.

11:25.520 --> 11:28.840
All that's left is a ghost,

11:30.160 --> 11:31.720
a black hole.

11:42.400 --> 11:47.880
The genesis of Sagittarius A*
wasn't some bizarre one-off event.

11:49.160 --> 11:52.800
It's possible
that almost all early stars

11:52.880 --> 11:55.160
became black holes when they died.

11:57.400 --> 12:02.520
Black holes are simply what happens
when gravity goes unchecked,

12:03.560 --> 12:08.480
compacting matters so densely
it tears a hole in the universe.

12:11.760 --> 12:13.280
In the vicinity of a black hole,

12:13.360 --> 12:17.680
space and time behave
in very counter-intuitive ways.

12:18.080 --> 12:23.240
In fact, this river provides a beautiful
and surprisingly accurate analogy.

12:23.320 --> 12:26.760
See, close to a black hole,
you can think of space itself

12:26.840 --> 12:29.760
as flowing towards the black hole.

12:33.800 --> 12:37.600
Now, here, the flow is not too fast.

12:37.680 --> 12:39.840
And so, you can imagine
I can jump into that river,

12:39.920 --> 12:43.120
I can swim faster
than the river of space.

12:43.200 --> 12:45.760
And so, I can escape
out into the galaxy.

12:46.480 --> 12:48.560
But as you get closer to the black hole,

12:48.640 --> 12:53.120
the river of space flows
faster and faster and faster.

12:57.760 --> 13:02.000
A collapsed star
is so small and yet so massive

13:02.560 --> 13:06.840
that, close to it, the gravitational
forces become overwhelming.

13:32.480 --> 13:37.880
There is no limit to the speed
at which the river of space can flow.

13:53.160 --> 13:56.200
There's a place where
the river becomes a waterfall,

13:56.280 --> 14:00.680
where no matter how fast I swim,
I could never escape upstream.

14:00.760 --> 14:03.600
And that's what happens
in the vicinity of a black hole.

14:06.960 --> 14:12.600
The river of space flows at, and then,
faster than the speed of light.

14:12.680 --> 14:16.600
Light itself can't move
fast enough to escape.

14:20.320 --> 14:23.000
And that's what Sagittarius A* is.

14:23.560 --> 14:26.800
It's a waterfall
in the fabric of the universe.

14:38.160 --> 14:40.400
From the moment the black hole formed,

14:41.280 --> 14:45.960
the seed of Sagittarius A*
had a heart of pure darkness,

14:50.400 --> 14:54.200
the interior forever hidden from view,

14:54.280 --> 14:58.280
shielded from the rest of the universe
by a boundary in space...

15:00.440 --> 15:02.200
the event horizon,

15:03.640 --> 15:05.680
the ultimate point of no return.

15:12.400 --> 15:16.760
As we approach the event horizon,
we get our first glimpse

15:16.840 --> 15:20.000
of the true weirdness of black holes.

15:32.440 --> 15:36.200
Einstein taught us that space and time
are not what they seem.

15:36.760 --> 15:41.160
They are merged together into a kind of
a fabric, the fabric of the universe.

15:41.280 --> 15:43.040
It's called spacetime.

15:43.120 --> 15:46.920
And Einstein also taught us that
the presence of massive objects,

15:47.000 --> 15:48.920
stars, and planets, and galaxies,

15:49.000 --> 15:53.080
curve and distort
the fabric of the universe,

15:53.160 --> 15:55.840
and that's what we feel
as the force of gravity.

16:08.240 --> 16:13.600
But that distortion
is not only in space, it's also in time.

16:16.480 --> 16:19.640
As you go closer and closer
to a massive object,

16:19.720 --> 16:22.360
the rate that time passes slows down.

16:22.960 --> 16:25.480
So, if I look towards a black hole,

16:25.560 --> 16:30.120
I see time passing
slower and slower and slower

16:30.200 --> 16:35.200
until on the event horizon, time stops.

17:18.560 --> 17:24.080
Sagittarius A* was born a waterfall
in the fabric of the universe,

17:25.680 --> 17:31.880
where space flows faster than light
and time grinds to a halt.

17:41.880 --> 17:44.520
But our black hole
was still just a baby,

17:48.680 --> 17:50.720
dwarfed by the stars around It.

17:51.720 --> 17:55.440
It was nothing like
the monster it would become.

18:05.640 --> 18:11.160
Sagittarius A* today is
four million times the mass of the sun.

18:11.280 --> 18:13.800
There has never been
a star that massive.

18:14.160 --> 18:18.520
So, it must have formed by the collapse
of something much smaller,

18:18.960 --> 18:22.480
and then, it must have grown
over the lifetime of the Milky Way

18:22.560 --> 18:23.600
by eating stuff.

18:24.240 --> 18:28.680
And fortunately, there has been
a lot of stuff around for it to eat.

18:32.480 --> 18:36.320
The young black hole's
inexorable gravitational pull

18:36.400 --> 18:40.120
meant there was no escape
for anything that strayed too close.

18:56.880 --> 19:03.200
Sagittarius A* began to grow,
pulling on nearby stars...

19:07.680 --> 19:12.840
before ripping them to shreds
and feasting on hot plasma,

19:19.400 --> 19:25.520
the black hole gaining more mass
and more gravitational power.

19:31.000 --> 19:34.560
But we don't think there were
enough stars nearby

19:34.640 --> 19:39.160
for the black hole to grow supermassive
on a diet of stars alone.

19:42.920 --> 19:46.920
Instead, it developed a taste
for more massive prey.

20:10.400 --> 20:14.600
When another black hole
passed close to Sagittarius A%

20:14.680 --> 20:17.720
they became locked
in a gravitational embrace...

20:25.840 --> 20:30.680
spiralling towards each other,
approaching half the speed of light...

20:37.200 --> 20:38.760
before colliding.

20:47.160 --> 20:50.720
Sagittarius A* cannibalised its cousin,

20:53.440 --> 20:57.080
creating ripples in the fabric
of the universe itself.

21:03.880 --> 21:05.640
More meals were to follow.

21:06.480 --> 21:10.000
Black holes, stars, gas clouds,

21:10.080 --> 21:13.840
whatever ventured
too deep into its lair.

21:17.600 --> 21:21.040
And as our black hole's
power and influence grew,

21:24.320 --> 21:26.520
its surroundings were changing, too.

21:29.480 --> 21:34.840
Around the galactic core, hundreds
of billions of stars were in orbit

21:38.840 --> 21:43.440
slowly spinning
around their common centre of mass,

21:47.280 --> 21:51.440
evolving into
the familiar spiralling disk...

21:54.800 --> 21:57.760
the majestic Milky Way,

21:57.840 --> 22:02.160
with Sagittarius A* at its core.

22:15.000 --> 22:19.800
Sagittarius A* became what we now call
a supermassive black hole.

22:19.880 --> 22:23.360
Many tens or even hundreds
of thousands of times more massive

22:23.440 --> 22:25.560
than any star in the universe.

22:26.080 --> 22:28.720
And Sagittarius A* is not unique.

22:28.800 --> 22:31.760
We now think that virtually
every large galaxy

22:31.840 --> 22:34.800
has a supermassive black hole
at its heart.

22:48.960 --> 22:51.840
Chandra has looked beyond the Milky Way

22:51.920 --> 22:55.080
and observed countless
supermassive black holes,

22:55.160 --> 23:00.320
lurking at the hearts of the myriad
galaxies that litter the cosmos.

23:07.040 --> 23:10.880
These monsters aren't
obscure quirks of nature.

23:11.800 --> 23:14.600
They are fundamental features of it...

23:18.320 --> 23:20.560
and far from being bit players.

23:21.200 --> 23:22.800
We're starting to realise that

23:22.880 --> 23:28.480
black holes have the power and reach
to sculpt the galaxies around them.

23:44.080 --> 23:48.080
The centre of our young galaxy
was rich in gas and dust,

23:50.440 --> 23:52.720
more offerings to feast on.

24:03.560 --> 24:05.320
This was a gluttonous period

24:06.360 --> 24:10.360
that marked a new era for
the Milky Way's supermassive black hole

24:13.360 --> 24:18.880
when the invisible monster
became sculptor of the galaxy.

24:37.800 --> 24:41.640
Creation and destruction
often go hand in hand in the universe,

24:41.720 --> 24:43.360
and black holes are no exception.

24:43.440 --> 24:48.280
Sagittarius A* is certainly not only
an agent of destruction

24:48.360 --> 24:52.080
because the material that
falls inwards towards the black hole

24:52.160 --> 24:54.720
doesn't all vanish
across the event horizon.

24:55.200 --> 24:58.160
A lot of it goes into orbit
around the black hole.

25:01.840 --> 25:04.520
And that region is tremendously violent.

25:04.600 --> 25:07.280
There are magnetic fields
that swirl around

25:07.360 --> 25:12.120
and become twisted and distorted,
and they can throw material out

25:12.200 --> 25:14.480
along the magnetic poles
of the black hole,

25:14.560 --> 25:18.120
making jets that
sweep through the galaxy.

25:23.040 --> 25:25.120
It's only recently that we've grasped

25:25.200 --> 25:29.000
the true scale of
Sagittarius A*'s eruptions.

25:34.840 --> 25:35.840
Engine start.

25:37.640 --> 25:41.080
...one, zero. Lift-off.

25:45.840 --> 25:49.160
The Delta rocket carrying
a gamma ray telescope,

25:49.240 --> 25:52.920
searching for unseen physics
in the stars of the galaxies.

26:04.840 --> 26:06.680
Just over a decade ago,

26:06.760 --> 26:10.040
a completely unexpected discovery
was made,

26:10.120 --> 26:13.800
likened to finding
a brand new continent here on Earth.

26:23.920 --> 26:28.040
The Fermi Space Telescope
was built to detect gamma rays,

26:28.600 --> 26:31.560
the most energetic
radiation in the universe.

26:46.240 --> 26:50.480
As Fermi orbited the earth,
it constructed a map of the sky...

27:01.480 --> 27:05.480
and saw emerging
from the plane of the Milky Way,

27:10.240 --> 27:17.200
two colossal bubbles of material,
each 25,000 light years across.

27:26.560 --> 27:29.360
These bubbles are superheated gas.

27:30.520 --> 27:32.200
If our eyes were sensitive

27:32.280 --> 27:34.800
to the wavelengths of light
emitted by those bubbles,

27:34.880 --> 27:39.120
they would span half the sky
as seen from here on Earth.

27:39.920 --> 27:43.080
And they point back
to the centre of the galaxy.

27:43.160 --> 27:46.920
It looks like their origin
is Sagittarius A*.

27:47.000 --> 27:48.040
Think about that.

27:48.120 --> 27:52.560
I mean, Sagittarius A* is big
but not big on a galactic scale.

27:52.640 --> 27:55.280
It would fit comfortably
inside the orbit of Mercury,

27:55.360 --> 27:56.560
in our solar system.

28:01.280 --> 28:05.560
Though our black hole is only a fraction
of the size of the galaxy around it,

28:07.640 --> 28:11.040
it had become sculptor of the Milky Way.

28:32.560 --> 28:34.200
Every few million years,

28:34.920 --> 28:38.400
the dense ring of material
circling our black hole

28:43.920 --> 28:47.480
was accelerated
by twisting magnetic fields...

28:49.720 --> 28:53.240
into fiery jets of superheated matter.

28:59.320 --> 29:01.440
Jets so powerful

29:01.520 --> 29:05.280
they stripped the atmospheres
from any planets in their path,

29:15.080 --> 29:18.680
and radiation rendered
every earth-like world

29:18.760 --> 29:22.600
within 1,000 light years uninhabitable.

29:36.560 --> 29:40.880
But such was the scale
of Sagittarius A*'s outbursts

29:40.960 --> 29:43.920
that far, far out in the galaxy,

29:49.560 --> 29:50.720
destruction...

29:52.840 --> 29:54.560
turned to creation.

30:19.040 --> 30:22.600
If you're looking for reasons
why life not only began here on Earth

30:23.160 --> 30:26.240
but was able to prosper
for the almost four billion years

30:26.320 --> 30:28.000
it took for it to evolve

30:28.080 --> 30:30.720
into the complex living world
that we see today,

30:30.800 --> 30:34.000
then, it might seem a bit of a stretch
to point to a supermassive black hole

30:34.080 --> 30:37.480
at the centre of our galaxy and say,
"That's one of the reasons why."

30:38.080 --> 30:39.840
But we're now beginning to suspect

30:39.920 --> 30:44.160
that those great outpourings
of energy from Sagittarius A*

30:44.240 --> 30:48.520
played a crucial role
in making this region of the galaxy,

30:48.600 --> 30:51.120
one in which life can flourish.

30:54.960 --> 30:58.840
Because the hot gas
ejected by Sagittarius A*

30:59.960 --> 31:03.000
had a calming effect on the galaxy.

31:03.080 --> 31:06.680
Now, you might think that a hot
gas cloud would produce more stars.

31:06.760 --> 31:09.160
But, in fact, the opposite is true
because hot means that

31:09.240 --> 31:12.520
everything's moving around very fast,
and that makes it more difficult

31:12.600 --> 31:17.560
for gravity to grab hold of everything
and collapse it to form stars.

31:17.640 --> 31:21.040
So, Sagittarius A*
reduced the number of stars

31:21.120 --> 31:25.680
that formed in this region
of the galaxy, and that's a good thing.

31:25.760 --> 31:27.880
I mean, imagine if there was
some giant star

31:27.960 --> 31:32.400
that had formed close by
that exploded in a supernova explosion.

31:32.480 --> 31:35.440
That would not be a good thing
if you're an amoeba

31:35.520 --> 31:39.120
and you have designs, one day,
on evolving into Einstein.

31:39.840 --> 31:43.640
So, Sagittarius A* turned
what is potentially

31:43.720 --> 31:47.560
a violent region of our galaxy
into a peaceful one.

31:55.240 --> 31:59.120
The warm gases
pushed out by Sagittarius A*

31:59.200 --> 32:01.760
slowed the rate of star formation.

32:08.560 --> 32:13.480
And around one small yellow star
in a quiet region

32:13.560 --> 32:17.440
at the unfashionable end
of the outer spiral arms of the galaxy,

32:29.880 --> 32:34.760
four billion years of stability
made all the difference.

32:56.480 --> 32:58.720
Now, of course,
there are many things that are necessary

32:58.800 --> 33:00.560
for life to exist on a planet.

33:01.360 --> 33:06.480
The list is unimaginably vast,
but I think it is interesting

33:06.560 --> 33:11.920
that on that list, there is the presence
of this strange object,

33:12.000 --> 33:14.560
a black hole, Sagittarius A*,

33:14.640 --> 33:18.920
tens of thousands of light years away
at the centre of our galaxy.

33:43.560 --> 33:48.920
Having cleared out much of the gas,
dust and stars that once lay close by,

33:51.840 --> 33:53.720
there was little left to feast on.

33:57.080 --> 33:59.800
Our black hole fell silent.

34:04.760 --> 34:07.760
The enormous bubbles spotted by Fermi...

34:09.280 --> 34:12.200
echoes of a glorious past.

34:19.320 --> 34:24.000
Today, Sagittarius A*
Is a sleeping giant,

34:25.560 --> 34:30.440
a brooding beast
operating on a slow simmer.

34:44.360 --> 34:48.400
Sagittarius A*'s journey
from violent destroyer

34:48.480 --> 34:50.680
to sculptor of the galaxy

34:50.760 --> 34:52.800
to the sleeping giant that we see today

34:52.880 --> 34:57.440
has been pieced together over
the last 20 years by observational data

34:57.520 --> 35:00.600
from telescopes such as
Chandra and Fermi.

35:02.560 --> 35:04.840
But there's
a very big difference indeed,

35:04.920 --> 35:06.400
between knowing how a black hole

35:06.480 --> 35:09.880
interacts with its environment,
how it sculpts a galaxy

35:10.680 --> 35:14.240
and what it actually is at a deep level.

35:17.680 --> 35:20.360
What is it really like inside?

35:55.720 --> 35:59.640
It's by looking into the future
that we're beginning to explore

35:59.720 --> 36:02.320
the deep mystery of black holes.

36:07.680 --> 36:11.040
Dozens of stars
orbit around Sagittarius A%

36:12.680 --> 36:18.160
some passing just a few
billion miles from the event horizon,

36:18.240 --> 36:21.480
a hair's breadth on galactic scales.

36:23.840 --> 36:26.920
These flybys
could have fatal consequences.

36:40.960 --> 36:44.960
Some of these stars
will likely have planets in orbit,

36:45.040 --> 36:48.800
planets that may stray
too close to the beast

36:57.880 --> 37:04.640
a moth to a flame, pulled from
its parent star towards the abyss.

37:18.040 --> 37:20.800
If the planet survives
its journey inwards,

37:23.600 --> 37:28.360
and we could stand on its surface
and look out into the universe beyond,

37:38.880 --> 37:44.040
we would see space and time
becoming increasingly distorted.

38:07.280 --> 38:11.680
But eventually, tidal
gravitational forces become too strong.

38:33.920 --> 38:37.680
Inexorably, the singularity awaits,

38:39.280 --> 38:44.280
the end of time
where all paths terminate.

39:12.400 --> 39:18.080
Over trillions of years,
all the stars around Sagittarius A*

39:18.160 --> 39:21.000
will gradually fade and die.

39:26.680 --> 39:31.800
On more and more alien worlds,
the dawn will fail to come.

39:41.720 --> 39:45.320
But our supermassive monster will go on,

39:46.640 --> 39:49.040
its secrets sealed away inside...

39:50.480 --> 39:52.920
seemingly forever.

39:59.680 --> 40:02.240
We predict that, one day,

40:02.320 --> 40:06.480
black holes will be
all that remains in the universe.

40:07.000 --> 40:09.080
The final dark age.

40:30.280 --> 40:33.360
If nothing can ever escape
from black holes,

40:33.440 --> 40:37.400
if Sagittarius A*
really is an eternal prison,

40:37.480 --> 40:40.640
then, this is the end
of the story of the universe,

40:40.720 --> 40:44.240
darkness littered
with holes in spacetime.

40:44.840 --> 40:47.440
But we don't think
this is the end of the story.

40:52.480 --> 40:57.200
We now believe
that even black holes die.

41:04.320 --> 41:07.640
And their deaths come
at the hands of what might seem

41:07.720 --> 41:12.960
an inconsequential detail
discovered almost five decades ago.

41:16.800 --> 41:22.160
In 1975, Stephen Hawking published
a remarkable paper in which he showed

41:22.280 --> 41:25.200
that black holes
are not completely black.

41:25.280 --> 41:28.440
They glow faintly.
They have a temperature.

41:28.520 --> 41:33.200
And here's his beautiful equation
for the temperature of a black hole.

41:37.960 --> 41:41.600
And you can see that there's
something deep going on...

41:42.480 --> 41:46.280
because this has got
all of physics in it.

41:46.680 --> 41:49.200
This thing here,
"h-bar", is Planck's constant,

41:49.280 --> 41:52.200
that's to do with quantum mechanics,
the subatomic world.

41:52.280 --> 41:56.200
Is the speed of light.
"G" is the strength of gravity.

41:56.280 --> 41:58.800
This "kB" here is Boltzmann's constant,

41:58.880 --> 42:02.560
that's to do with
temperature and thermodynamics.

42:02.640 --> 42:05.160
And this "M" here is the mass
of the black hole.

42:05.240 --> 42:07.920
It's even got circles
because it's got a pi in it.

42:09.120 --> 42:13.960
Hawking's conclusion
proved to be irrefutable

42:14.040 --> 42:17.360
and the implications are huge.

42:17.960 --> 42:21.200
If something has a temperature,
then it radiates.

42:21.280 --> 42:23.640
That's why if you put your hand
near something that's hot,

42:23.720 --> 42:25.040
you can feel it.

42:25.120 --> 42:26.720
And so, over timescales that are

42:26.800 --> 42:29.600
billions and billions
and billions and billions of times

42:29.680 --> 42:32.520
longer than the current age
of the universe,

42:32.600 --> 42:37.400
Sagittarius A*
will eventually evaporate away.

42:57.920 --> 43:04.600
Very gradually, Hawking radiation
will erode Sagittarius A*...

43:08.200 --> 43:11.120
smaller and smaller...

43:16.120 --> 43:20.040
until many trillions and trillions
of years into the future...

43:26.200 --> 43:28.000
...in a final burst of light,

43:30.600 --> 43:33.440
our black hole will die.

43:34.840 --> 43:37.680
And then, there will be darkness...

43:39.120 --> 43:41.120
for all eternity.

43:48.120 --> 43:51.560
Now, you may say quite legitimately,
"Well, why do we care?

43:51.640 --> 43:54.880
"Why does it matter if black holes
evaporate away sometime

43:54.960 --> 43:59.280
"in the far, far future of the universe?
There'll be nobody around to see it."

44:00.000 --> 44:04.800
But the discovery that black holes
evaporate raises what I think

44:04.880 --> 44:08.280
is the most profound question
in the history of physics,

44:08.360 --> 44:11.760
certainly over the last 100 years,
and that's no exaggeration.

44:12.320 --> 44:17.600
See, what happens if I set fire
to this piece of paper...

44:19.280 --> 44:21.320
with Stephen Hawking's
equation written on it?

44:21.400 --> 44:27.200
I cause it to evaporate away.
Do I destroy everything?

44:27.280 --> 44:29.960
Do I remove every piece of information,

44:30.040 --> 44:33.760
including the equation,
from the universe when it burns away?

44:54.080 --> 44:56.000
Well, the answer is, no.

44:56.080 --> 45:01.560
If I could collect every ash,
every molecule of gas

45:01.640 --> 45:03.920
that burns off into the atmosphere,

45:04.000 --> 45:08.080
then, in principle, I could
reconstruct the piece of paper,

45:08.160 --> 45:10.440
and everything it contains,

45:10.520 --> 45:13.680
every piece of information
on this piece of paper

45:14.160 --> 45:16.720
including Stephen Hawking's equation.

45:18.840 --> 45:24.640
But can that be true for black holes,
the ultimate gravitational prisons,

45:24.720 --> 45:30.320
these objects in the sky from which
even light itself can't escape?

45:31.120 --> 45:35.440
When they evaporate away,
do they return the information

45:35.520 --> 45:39.400
about everything that ever fell in
back to the universe?

46:27.120 --> 46:33.480
If information somehow escapes from
Sagittarius A* as it evaporates away,

46:35.280 --> 46:37.920
the implication is profound.

46:40.880 --> 46:43.240
Black holes aren't tombs.

46:44.120 --> 46:45.320
They're gateways.

46:48.880 --> 46:55.280
We now believe that anything that falls
into Sagittarius A* will live on,

46:59.520 --> 47:03.560
not as a physical object
but as information...

47:09.520 --> 47:11.960
escaping from the heart of darkness,

47:13.360 --> 47:17.600
encoded in the Hawking radiation
in the far future.

47:28.400 --> 47:32.240
The memory of all those worlds
that fell into Sagittarius A*,

47:32.320 --> 47:35.440
of the entire history
of the Milky Way galaxy,

47:35.520 --> 47:39.480
is somehow written in the ashes
of the universe in the far future.

47:43.040 --> 47:45.800
But the real treasure lies
in the explanation

47:45.880 --> 47:50.000
of how the information gets out
from those eternal prisons.

47:50.360 --> 47:53.400
Now, what I'm going to tell you
is going to sound absolutely bizarre.

47:53.480 --> 47:55.520
It's going to sound
like science fiction.

47:56.160 --> 47:57.600
But here goes.

47:57.680 --> 48:02.560
When the black hole is evaporated away,
about half of it is gone.

48:03.240 --> 48:07.720
The interior becomes, in some sense,
the same place

48:07.800 --> 48:12.040
as the distant Hawking radiation
that was emitted aeons ago

48:12.120 --> 48:14.880
that's out there
in the far reaches of the universe.

48:15.400 --> 48:19.400
It seems that
spacetime wormholes open up

48:19.480 --> 48:24.320
between the interior of the black hole
and those distant parts of the universe.

48:24.400 --> 48:29.280
And it's that that allows us
to read the information inside.

48:29.360 --> 48:32.760
Now, that
is supposed to sound weird,

48:32.840 --> 48:36.000
and I should say that
nobody really agrees

48:36.080 --> 48:38.640
on the physical picture
of what's happening.

48:38.720 --> 48:42.000
But what everybody agrees on is this.

48:42.080 --> 48:43.840
The black holes are telling us

48:43.920 --> 48:49.600
that our intuitive picture of reality,
of space and time is wrong.

48:49.680 --> 48:54.000
The idea that
this place is close to this place,

48:54.080 --> 48:57.120
and that time ticks along is wrong.

48:57.200 --> 49:03.840
There is a deeper picture of reality
in which space and time do not exist.

49:13.160 --> 49:16.280
Our attempt to answer
a seemingly simple question

49:17.760 --> 49:21.240
about the fate of objects
that fall into black holes

49:21.320 --> 49:26.400
has led us to a profound,
and quite unsettling conclusion.

49:29.040 --> 49:35.000
Space and time, concepts so foundational
to how we experience the world

49:35.960 --> 49:39.560
are not fundamental
properties of nature.

49:42.880 --> 49:49.720
They emerge from a deeper reality
in which neither exist.

49:53.880 --> 50:00.600
The thing about black holes
is that nobody really understands them.

50:00.680 --> 50:05.280
So, don't worry if you don't understand
what I'm talking about

50:05.360 --> 50:07.560
because I don't understand
what I'm talking about,

50:07.640 --> 50:09.240
and nobody else does either.

50:20.520 --> 50:22.280
We're still a long way

50:22.360 --> 50:26.480
from fully comprehending
the secrets of black holes.

50:30.000 --> 50:32.080
But we are beginning to lift the veil.

50:38.440 --> 50:41.520
Far from being a mere cosmic aberration,

50:44.200 --> 50:48.640
Sagittarius A* is a part of our history

50:48.720 --> 50:51.480
and of our future.

50:53.120 --> 50:56.720
Our black hole
not only made us who we are today,

50:58.520 --> 51:00.200
it's our teacher,

51:01.520 --> 51:05.480
slowly revealing
the deepest mysteries of the universe,

51:07.480 --> 51:10.520
secrets sealed away for so long

51:12.960 --> 51:16.080
inside a place beyond forever.

51:21.760 --> 51:24.760
The moral of the story is this.

51:24.840 --> 51:27.360
Understanding the book
of nature is hard.

51:27.920 --> 51:29.560
And so, the more of nature we observe,

51:29.640 --> 51:32.440
the more chance we have
of finishing the book.

51:32.880 --> 51:38.160
Now, the strangest objects in nature,
by far, are black holes.

51:38.240 --> 51:39.800
And so, I suppose, it's not surprising

51:39.880 --> 51:43.040
that by peering over the horizon
and into the darkness,

51:43.120 --> 51:46.080
we have caught a glimpse
of something deeply hidden,

51:46.680 --> 51:50.680
the underlying structure
of reality itself.

51:53.520 --> 51:55.880
So, if we want to understand
the meaning of it all,

51:55.960 --> 51:58.160
we can't restrict ourselves

51:58.240 --> 52:01.200
to the intellectually safe confines
of our planet.

52:01.800 --> 52:05.680
We have to look out there,
to the universe beyond.

52:53.240 --> 52:57.200
So, of the seemingly
endless zoo of objects in our universe,

52:57.320 --> 53:01.160
from clouds of gas, to planets,
to stars, galaxies, what have you,

53:01.240 --> 53:05.400
black holes are probably
one of the most fundamentally important

53:05.480 --> 53:08.720
singular class of objects
that we can study,

53:09.440 --> 53:12.080
a place where the laws of physics
literally break down.

53:12.600 --> 53:16.240
We have theories, but we can't
really know what's happening.

53:16.880 --> 53:19.800
So, black holes
present this remarkable invitation

53:19.880 --> 53:22.160
to physicists,
mathematicians, astronomers.

53:22.240 --> 53:24.400
One of the best tools we have to study

53:24.480 --> 53:27.320
these exotic phenomena
is the Chandra telescope.

53:32.800 --> 53:34.760
Chandra's kind of like
a black hole hunter,

53:34.840 --> 53:38.520
finding them near and far
throughout the galaxy and the universe.

53:38.600 --> 53:40.040
Just a few minutes away

53:40.120 --> 53:42.280
from the 26th flight
of the shuttle, Columbia,

53:42.360 --> 53:43.600
with a crew of five.

53:50.480 --> 53:53.600
I think a night launch
Is particularly exciting.

53:54.240 --> 53:56.400
We have a go
for engine start.

53:57.360 --> 54:00.840
We have booster ignition,
lift-off of Columbia.

54:05.160 --> 54:07.040
You just see fire.

54:07.120 --> 54:10.160
It lights up the night sky
in the most beautiful way.

54:10.680 --> 54:13.800
Columbia now has burned
more than two million pounds of fuel

54:13.880 --> 54:15.760
and weighs half
of what it did at launch.

54:15.840 --> 54:18.840
Its huge. Chandra is about
the size of a school bus.

54:18.920 --> 54:23.280
It's the largest telescope to ever
be launched by the space shuttle.

54:29.360 --> 54:31.160
SRB separation is confirmed.

54:31.960 --> 54:35.040
You're stressed about the astronauts
on board that are literally

54:35.120 --> 54:39.400
risking their lives to help us
get a better view of the universe.

54:42.640 --> 54:45.160
When the main engine's
cut off, we're in Zero-G.

54:45.240 --> 54:48.000
We separate the tank
and we're orbiting the earth.

54:50.000 --> 54:51.280
And when we're sure

54:51.360 --> 54:52.896
that everyone is ready
at mission control,

54:52.920 --> 54:55.320
then, I go ahead and pull the switch
marked "Deploy”.

54:55.760 --> 54:58.880
And you're looking at the deploy
of the Chandra X-ray Observatory.

55:00.200 --> 55:04.040
Chandra is an X-ray telescope,
which means that it can see

55:04.120 --> 55:07.120
the most energetic light
coming at us from the universe.

55:07.840 --> 55:11.400
The telescope has to be
outside the earth's atmosphere

55:11.480 --> 55:15.360
because the earth's atmosphere,
thankfully for us, blocks out X-rays.

55:15.440 --> 55:17.000
Otherwise, we'd just get fried.

55:19.560 --> 55:20.920
The Chandra satellite,

55:21.000 --> 55:24.040
by rising above the atmosphere,
has a much clearer view.

55:25.040 --> 55:27.880
Why is that so interesting
for studying things like black holes?

55:27.960 --> 55:32.280
Black holes can excite matter
in their vicinity to very high energies.

55:32.360 --> 55:35.800
They can get atoms and parts
of atoms whipping around,

55:35.880 --> 55:40.000
and by revving up those particles
to very, very high energies,

55:40.080 --> 55:41.600
they will radiate.

55:42.280 --> 55:45.240
So, we can gather
enormous amounts of information

55:45.320 --> 55:48.200
about the immediate vicinity
of a black hole.

55:52.040 --> 55:56.360
When we look at Sagittarius A* today,
it's quiet and not doing very much.

55:56.440 --> 55:59.080
But when we look at other supermassive
black holes in the universe,

55:59.120 --> 56:00.160
they're active.

56:02.880 --> 56:04.760
So, you can
take Chandra and watch

56:04.840 --> 56:08.640
a black hole have a small snack,
maybe like a human might have

56:08.720 --> 56:12.200
a little biscuit in the afternoon.
And it's something like an asteroid,

56:12.280 --> 56:15.960
and there will be a small sort of
X-ray signature from that event.

56:16.440 --> 56:21.120
But you can also see a black hole
have a really, really big snack

56:21.200 --> 56:23.320
and Chandra's able
to witness that as well.

56:24.800 --> 56:26.200
Chandra has witnessed

56:26.280 --> 56:29.440
the destruction of a star
by a black hole itself, right?

56:29.520 --> 56:33.200
So, this poor star wanders in
to the black hole,

56:34.680 --> 56:38.000
then, it rips the star apart,
it shears it, right?

56:38.080 --> 56:40.920
And then, the corpse of that star,

56:41.000 --> 56:42.880
this sort of spaghetti-fied matter

56:42.960 --> 56:45.600
that starts spiralling
around the event horizon,

56:45.680 --> 56:47.000
lights up in X-rays.

56:49.160 --> 56:53.800
So, to be witness to that,
to observe the destruction of a star,

56:53.880 --> 56:59.240
you know, in time, it was just
extraordinary. It's just unbelievable.

57:02.000 --> 57:05.160
There's this one
pretty famous image that Chandra took

57:05.240 --> 57:10.320
called the Chandra Deep Field-South,
and it's the deepest X-ray image ever.

57:10.400 --> 57:14.160
In that one dataset
there's thousands of black holes,

57:14.240 --> 57:17.000
like, maybe 5,000 of them, if not more.

57:17.080 --> 57:21.960
And it just kind of helps show you
that they're all over the place

57:22.040 --> 57:24.240
and there's so much more to discover.
