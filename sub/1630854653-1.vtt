Charles, how you doing today?

00:46.120 --> 00:50.000
Right, I'm gonna switch this on.
This is our recording device.

00:50.040 --> 00:52.720
There's no rush.
I know you've thought about this,

00:52.760 --> 00:54.720
so just take your time, OK?

01:19.680 --> 01:21.480
Hello, Stella.

01:27.080 --> 01:29.600
# This inner circle

01:29.640 --> 01:33.800
# Is bored of you and me

01:33.840 --> 01:38.240
# There's no more detail

01:38.280 --> 01:42.600
# All that we have seen

01:42.640 --> 01:45.640
# Thank God that you love her

01:45.680 --> 01:50.320
# Something good is real

01:50.360 --> 01:54.080
# Fill those empty houses

01:54.120 --> 01:57.520
# Before they'll fall away

01:57.560 --> 02:02.080
# Your lie

02:02.120 --> 02:05.280
# Will go away. #

02:05.320 --> 02:06.880
Can you be gentle, though?

02:06.920 --> 02:09.200
Yeah, sorry.
Like gentle, gentle now.

02:09.240 --> 02:12.200
All right. Oh, does that hurt?
Yeah! OK, sorry.

Stop it.
I'm only touching your leg.

02:58.200 --> 02:59.720
Just get off me, yeah?

03:01.200 --> 03:02.760
You got nice legs, that's all.

03:02.800 --> 03:04.920
Yeah, I know, but I don't...

03:04.960 --> 03:06.880
Just don't want your hands
all over me.

03:15.440 --> 03:16.960
Ah, this ain't it, look.

03:17.000 --> 03:18.600
Nah, I think it is.

03:18.640 --> 03:21.360
No, it's not, keep...
You what?

03:21.400 --> 03:23.440
She can stay,
but you need to get out.

03:23.480 --> 03:26.280
Who, who d'you think you're talking
to about I need to get out?

03:26.320 --> 03:28.680
Do you wanna say hello
to that camera?

03:39.400 --> 03:43.360
You all right?
Yeah. Thanks.

03:44.560 --> 03:46.440
He had shit hair anyway.

04:15.360 --> 04:17.560

Hi! Morning!
You all right?

breakfast cob, Shelle, please.

04:29.080 --> 04:31.400
No problem.
Cheers, duck. All right, girl!

04:32.720 --> 04:35.440
Ah, put us a couple of extra
hash browns on that, will you?

04:35.480 --> 04:37.880
Of course!
Ta, duck.

04:37.920 --> 04:39.360
How you doing?

04:40.880 --> 04:42.800
Bloody long shift, that was.
Was it?

04:42.840 --> 04:45.400
About ready to put my trousers on.
What happened this time?

04:45.440 --> 04:47.920
Been one of them nights
where everyone decides

04:47.960 --> 04:50.400
they wanna make a bloody run for it.
Oh, yeah. Who got away?

04:50.440 --> 04:54.760
You what? No, mate, nobody got away,
not with me chasin' after 'em.

04:54.800 --> 04:57.000
Here you are, look at this.

04:58.720 --> 05:01.400
What is that?
Guess who I matched with on Tinder?

05:01.440 --> 05:03.120
Oh, my God. Who?

05:03.160 --> 05:05.600
Landlady from The King's Head.

05:05.640 --> 05:07.160
You know,
the one who sounds American.

05:07.200 --> 05:09.360
Yeah, but is actually
from Huthwaite.

AMERICAN ACCENT:
Two-week Californian cruise,

05:12.040 --> 05:13.520

05:13.560 --> 05:15.480
She's about 50, you know.

05:15.520 --> 05:16.800
I dunno, she's filthy.

05:16.840 --> 05:18.800
You shouldn't be having
love bites at your age.

05:18.840 --> 05:20.600
Hey!
Hi.

05:24.560 --> 05:27.760
Erm... OK. well, I didn't expect
it to be that quick.

05:30.240 --> 05:32.480
Yeah, OK. See you tonight.

06:12.200 --> 06:14.760
OK, let's get this over with.

06:14.800 --> 06:17.240
OK, erm... just set it up

'that you're listening.'

You OK? Yeah, do we really wanna
listen to his voice in here?

06:58.640 --> 07:00.640
In this house?
Where would you rather go?

07:00.680 --> 07:04.400
I don't know.
It just feels... close. Yeah.

07:04.440 --> 07:08.000
Look, we are in full control
of this.

07:08.040 --> 07:11.680
OK? We can stop it whenever we want.

07:12.760 --> 07:14.280
Yeah.

07:16.720 --> 07:20.720

you've suffered from that night.

Ssh.

'Charles.'

08:40.760 --> 08:42.440
He finally admitted it.

08:45.640 --> 08:46.840
You OK?

08:49.320 --> 08:51.280
No. I need a minute.

09:13.680 --> 09:18.280
Don't, Paul.
Don't shut me out. Please.

09:25.560 --> 09:26.800
Look at me.

09:36.400 --> 09:37.840
What you doing?

09:38.960 --> 09:40.120
No.

10:06.320 --> 10:09.560
THEY GROAN

11:30.720 --> 11:32.000
For fuck's sake.

11:37.000 --> 11:39.560
I know
I'm home a bit sooner than we said,

11:39.600 --> 11:41.280
but I can busy myself upstairs
until...

11:41.320 --> 11:42.960
No. it's fine, It's fine.
We're done.

11:44.000 --> 11:49.160
Yeah, we've, we've listened to it.
Oh. OK.

11:50.240 --> 11:53.080
Hey, Stella.
Hey, you all right? Yeah.

11:55.960 --> 11:57.360
How was it?

11:59.040 --> 12:00.440
Erm...
HE CLEARS THROAT

12:00.480 --> 12:02.520
He... he admitted he did it.

12:03.680 --> 12:08.160
Oh, Paul.
Yeah, I know. And, erm...

12:08.200 --> 12:11.960
He, erm, said he was sorry.
For all that's worth.

12:13.200 --> 12:15.480
He also suggested a meeting.

12:15.520 --> 12:19.800
Really?
Yeah. Unbelievable.

12:19.840 --> 12:22.680
As if we'd wanna be anywhere near
that man ever again.

12:22.720 --> 12:26.160
Hey. It's over, it's done.

12:26.200 --> 12:27.760
I'm gonna head off.

12:28.880 --> 12:30.320

13:20.720 --> 13:22.240
All right,
put your nanna back on.

13:22.280 --> 13:26.440
Yeah.
Well, that's an out and out lie.

13:26.480 --> 13:30.040
If he refuses his Weetabix,
there's no after school snack.

13:30.080 --> 13:34.320
Don't take any shit, Mum,
the kid's running rings around you.

13:34.360 --> 13:37.720
Yeah, all right,
I'll try you in my lunch, bye.

13:37.760 --> 13:41.160
Bobbi Carter?
You're not my nine o'clock, are you?

13:43.200 --> 13:45.200
Ta.
I'm back-to-back all day,

13:45.240 --> 13:47.280
but we can set you up
an appointment.

13:47.320 --> 13:48.800
It's a new case, right?

13:48.840 --> 13:53.360
No. I'm Stella, er, Tomlinson.

13:55.840 --> 13:59.360
Sorry, I didn't recognise you
from the trial.

13:59.400 --> 14:00.800
Oh, you were there?

14:00.840 --> 14:02.880
No, the press coverage.

14:04.440 --> 14:05.960
Well, it was three years ago now.

14:06.000 --> 14:08.160
I can give you ten minutes,
but you'll have to talk to me

14:08.200 --> 14:10.560
while I try and get
this Calpol stain out of me top.

14:15.760 --> 14:17.480
When did you speak to Paul?

14:18.800 --> 14:20.360
A few days ago.

14:21.440 --> 14:23.000
He said you'd listened to the audio

14:23.040 --> 14:25.200
and you wished to be removed
from the scheme.

14:25.240 --> 14:28.040
That neither of you
want to meet with Charles Stone.

14:28.080 --> 14:29.400
Yeah, that's right.

14:30.880 --> 14:33.880
I always leave it a few days, just
in case there's a change of heart.

14:33.920 --> 14:36.040
No, you close it.

14:38.880 --> 14:40.240
Have you met him?

14:40.280 --> 14:43.240
Charles?
Yeah.

14:46.040 --> 14:50.520
I'm the go-between, but my primary
concern is what's best for you.

14:51.520 --> 14:53.240
And you think
that's to meet with him?

14:53.280 --> 14:56.120
I can't make any guarantees,

14:56.160 --> 14:59.240
but a majority of people,
they find a deeper understanding.

14:59.280 --> 15:00.920
Well, you must've seen his record.

15:02.160 --> 15:03.520
He's got a history of violence

15:03.560 --> 15:05.600
years before he even went near
my daughter.

15:05.640 --> 15:08.680
Yeah. But that doesn't mean
a face-to-face apology

15:08.720 --> 15:11.760
can't be life-changing for you.

15:13.080 --> 15:14.240
I'm kinda done with people

15:14.280 --> 15:18.040
trying to tell me how to change my
life to be honest. Yeah, I get that.

15:18.080 --> 15:20.480
Go travelling, run a marathon.

15:20.520 --> 15:21.920
Have another child.

15:23.720 --> 15:28.000
People mean well, but too often
they... haven't got a clue.

15:29.600 --> 15:32.440
I believe in this process.

15:32.480 --> 15:34.600
85% of the people who meet...

15:34.640 --> 15:35.840
Have you lost a child?

15:36.880 --> 15:39.840
No. Not exactly.

15:39.880 --> 15:42.440
My little brother,
Darrell, was killed.

15:42.480 --> 15:44.680
Stabbed in the neck.

15:44.720 --> 15:46.720
He was at a house party

15:46.760 --> 15:50.120
and a girl asked him to help her
open a bottle of Lambrini.

15:50.160 --> 15:54.480
He did. No idea her boyfriend
was watching from across the room.

15:54.520 --> 15:57.320
Seconds later, Darrell was bleeding
out on the kitchen floor

15:57.360 --> 15:59.160
from a five-inch knife wound.

16:00.680 --> 16:02.240
And you met with his killer?

16:03.560 --> 16:05.640
I was one of the first
to do the scheme.

16:06.960 --> 16:08.600
What made you wanna do that?

16:09.880 --> 16:11.200
I'd hit rock bottom.

16:14.200 --> 16:20.160
And? And that meeting,
it changed my life.

16:23.120 --> 16:24.880
How exactly?

16:26.600 --> 16:28.200
Forgiveness.

16:30.480 --> 16:34.800
That's unimaginable to you...
I get that.

16:34.840 --> 16:36.280
KNOCK ON DOOR

16:36.320 --> 16:37.800
Hang on a minute, Ray.

16:38.880 --> 16:43.280
Erm, thank you for your time and,
yeah, I'll leave you to your day.

16:44.280 --> 16:48.520
Stella.
I hope I get to see you again.

17:31.320 --> 17:36.080
Ey-up, Mum!
Ah, here's my sunshine!

17:36.120 --> 17:40.760
Ooh, I wouldn't!

Oh, charming (!)

17:51.880 --> 17:54.240
SHE EXHALES
You look tired.

17:55.680 --> 17:58.040
Just got a lot on my mind.
I'm not really sleeping.

17:59.600 --> 18:03.040
Well, get a brush, get stuck in,
you can knacker yourself out a bit.

Er...

18:28.800 --> 18:30.440
You've got a fella on the go.

18:30.480 --> 18:32.080
Who is it?

18:32.120 --> 18:33.640
WHISPERS: It's Kelvin.

18:33.680 --> 18:37.240
Who's Kelvin?
Kentucky Kelvin.

18:37.280 --> 18:42.440
Owns the stables. Got Stetsons,
spurs, likes a western.

18:42.480 --> 18:45.800
THEY CHUCKLE
Oh, he sounds like a catch.

18:45.840 --> 18:48.720
Well, you'll meet him tonight.
Tonight?

18:50.920 --> 18:53.240
Oh shit, shit. Sorry, Mum.

18:53.280 --> 18:56.360
Mum, I'm sorry.
Happy birthday.

18:56.400 --> 18:58.360
Ooh. It's all right, duckie.

19:00.120 --> 19:02.960
Got a lot on, ain't you?
Sorry.

19:03.000 --> 19:04.800
Are we going to talk about it?

19:06.240 --> 19:08.560
Yes. I'll put kettle on.

19:13.240 --> 19:15.080
Does Paul want to meet with him?

19:17.040 --> 19:18.120
No, of course not.

19:18.160 --> 19:20.120
What about you?

19:25.200 --> 19:27.160
SHE EXHALES

19:27.200 --> 19:32.040
Maybe meeting with him...
even if you can't forgive him...

19:33.120 --> 19:36.640
..it might help break
this treading water.

19:38.320 --> 19:40.160
Could help
you and Paul get back on track.

19:40.200 --> 19:42.920
Mum, you know he's with Meera now.

19:44.640 --> 19:48.440
Maybe get you back in the office,
you used to love that job.

19:49.680 --> 19:52.760
Scares me half to death now,
you out driving all hours.

19:52.800 --> 19:54.600
Mum, stop!
What?

19:54.640 --> 19:56.560
It's fine, OK?
Everything is fine.

19:58.920 --> 20:00.840
Are you gonna bullshit me, an' all?

Stella to leave here today

29:06.760 --> 29:08.520

Charles, can you tell us what led up
to the events of that night?

29:26.320 --> 29:29.640
We tend to, just briefly,
start a bit further back.

29:29.680 --> 29:32.880
It can help ease us
into discussing things

29:32.920 --> 29:34.280
that we might not know.

29:34.320 --> 29:38.120
You're a Millfields girl?
What?

29:39.280 --> 29:41.120
It's strange
that our paths never crossed.

29:44.040 --> 29:48.080
I'm just saying, it's funny
how things turn out. Right.

29:48.120 --> 29:51.200
Let's get back to that night.

29:51.240 --> 29:55.360
Can you tell us about the motivation
behind stealing Stella's car?

29:56.840 --> 30:02.480
I'm asking you this because often
the motive is a lot less personal

30:02.520 --> 30:04.000
than the victims imagine.

30:04.040 --> 30:06.240
It's about
putting these pieces together.

30:06.280 --> 30:08.360
It can be reassuring.

30:11.600 --> 30:15.920
I had just done...
three months inside.

30:16.960 --> 30:18.520
I needed the money.

30:20.880 --> 30:22.760
I was in a bad place.

30:22.800 --> 30:24.840
I was drinking a lot back then.

30:27.560 --> 30:30.520
And can you now talk us
through the events of that night?

30:35.720 --> 30:37.040
Your, erm...

30:39.040 --> 30:41.560
..your Range Rover
was in the drive.

30:42.680 --> 30:45.200
People pay good money
for a car like that.

30:49.360 --> 30:51.000
I saw the lights were off.

30:52.040 --> 30:53.720
It was too early to be asleep.

30:55.120 --> 30:59.240
I honestly, honestly thought
no-one was home.

31:04.200 --> 31:06.040
So I had my chance and I took it.

31:10.600 --> 31:12.920
And I wish I could change it,
but I can't.

31:16.720 --> 31:21.120
And I regret that with everything
that's inside of me, Stella.

31:26.520 --> 31:27.960
I know you must feel the same.

31:30.400 --> 31:32.320
For leaving Maisy
on her own that night.

31:39.280 --> 31:41.360
We're gonna taking a break there.

31:51.480 --> 31:54.280
Are you OK?
No. I wanna leave.

31:54.320 --> 31:56.520
Look, I understand.
Why would he say that?

31:56.560 --> 32:00.000
This first bit can be very tricky,
but we can get through it.

32:07.480 --> 32:10.320
You can still get
what you want, Stella.

32:10.360 --> 32:12.320
Trust this process.

32:14.840 --> 32:20.960
This is about you... get what you
came for... and then we can leave.

32:42.440 --> 32:43.480

32:46.560 --> 32:51.320
Charles, Stella isn't here
to listen to justifications.

32:51.360 --> 32:54.960
She is here,
so you can take responsibility.

32:55.000 --> 33:00.080
Acknowledge what you did and why.
Can you do that?

33:00.120 --> 33:02.640
Yeah. That's why I asked
for the meeting.

33:02.680 --> 33:05.200
And that's why I'm here.
For the truth.

33:06.280 --> 33:09.920
Good. I just wanted you to know
that I've confronted my past.

33:11.400 --> 33:12.960
And I want to help you do the same.

33:14.160 --> 33:17.880
That's what this is about,
learning from our mistakes,

33:17.920 --> 33:20.960
processing where we are now
and how we can move forward.

33:22.240 --> 33:24.440
You OK to continue?
Yeah.

33:24.480 --> 33:26.440
Charles?
Yeah.

33:28.040 --> 33:31.280
Let's go back to how you got
into Stella's house that night.

33:32.800 --> 33:33.920
I forced the front door.

33:37.960 --> 33:39.680
And I'd just found the car keys.

33:42.320 --> 33:43.480
And then I saw her.

33:48.520 --> 33:49.600
Go on.

33:54.120 --> 33:55.360
Go on.

33:57.200 --> 33:59.600
I need you to tell me
why you killed my daughter.

34:11.640 --> 34:12.640
I didn't kill her.

34:14.360 --> 34:16.000
What?

34:16.040 --> 34:19.800
Your daughter was already dead
when I found her. No, no.

34:19.840 --> 34:21.200
Stop, Charles.

34:22.640 --> 34:24.240
You admitted it.

34:24.280 --> 34:25.880
I-I listened to it on the tape.

34:25.920 --> 34:27.760
You, you admitted it.
I didn't kill Maisy.

34:27.800 --> 34:29.520
I've been framed.
No, you can't do this.

34:29.560 --> 34:31.120
I was sent there that night.

34:31.160 --> 34:33.200

they're still out there.

34:33.240 --> 34:35.800

from Millfields. She's missing.

Her name is Cleo Dale.

34:37.360 --> 34:39.040
Get him off me!
Cleo Dale!

34:39.080 --> 34:40.880
Get him off me!
Please, please!

34:40.920 --> 34:43.280
Listen! Stella, they know her,
the people who set me up!

34:43.320 --> 34:44.880
Stop that! Have you got her?

34:44.920 --> 34:48.080
I think they're gonna hurt her,
Stella. Like they hurt Maisy.

34:48.120 --> 34:49.880
Her name's Cleo Dale.

34:56.360 --> 34:59.320
No! I'm not fucking OK.

35:14.480 --> 35:19.640
I'm so sorry, Stella, I honestly
don't know what just happened.

35:19.680 --> 35:21.400
He passed all the tests.

35:21.440 --> 35:24.080
He convinced us all
he wanted to take responsibility

35:24.120 --> 35:26.520
for the death of your daughter.

35:26.560 --> 35:28.800
I failed to protect you.

35:28.840 --> 35:30.280
And I am so sorry.

35:31.680 --> 35:33.200
He's out the scheme.

35:35.920 --> 35:37.760
Don't ever contact me again.

35:49.960 --> 35:53.640
When we first met, you seemed to
sense the personal connection I had

35:53.680 --> 35:55.560
to the work I do.

35:55.600 --> 35:58.040
To understand
how much I believe in it.

36:00.720 --> 36:02.760
What you did in that room
was unforgivable.

36:04.120 --> 36:06.520
Not only did you undermine something

36:06.560 --> 36:09.640
that has given solace to
people in their worst moments...

36:10.800 --> 36:12.880
..you manipulated it
to your own end.

36:15.720 --> 36:18.360
You'll never understand
the courage it takes

36:18.400 --> 36:21.560
to sit opposite the person
that destroyed your world.

36:24.960 --> 36:26.960
Don't believe in long sentences,
never have,

36:27.000 --> 36:28.200
but I've added to your file

36:28.240 --> 36:30.440
that you sought to play
the system using false remorse,

36:30.480 --> 36:32.960
in the hope that
they will increase yours.

36:35.480 --> 36:39.120
Are we done, then?
Oh, yeah.

36:47.720 --> 36:49.880

to make you poorly.

37:37.120 --> 37:39.080
Turn your motor off, eh?

37:46.840 --> 37:48.280
What's that?

37:52.760 --> 37:54.440
She's not gone missing, has she?

37:54.480 --> 37:56.720
What, do you know her?

37:56.760 --> 37:59.320
Yeah, she's one of the girls
from the stables.

38:00.360 --> 38:03.560
Er, Cleo? That's it. Poor gal.

38:04.760 --> 38:06.840
I think she had
a bit of a troubled home life.

38:07.880 --> 38:09.240
Did she know Maisy?

38:09.280 --> 38:12.600
Yeah, they were pals. Hold up.

38:14.520 --> 38:16.520
I've got some photos somewhere.

38:17.640 --> 38:18.880
Here y'are.

38:32.000 --> 38:33.120
Yes.

38:38.440 --> 38:40.680
So, they were close?

38:40.720 --> 38:42.080
Yeah, they were.

38:43.920 --> 38:46.160
