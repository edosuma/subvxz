00:26.260 --> 00:28.060
Paul
came home from the war

00:28.062 --> 00:31.363
with a fire in his head and
a dishonorable discharge

00:31.365 --> 00:34.767
under his belt for an
incident involving a shooting.

00:35.936 --> 00:38.370
The incident was, of
course, mysterious.

00:46.981 --> 00:49.048
The nightmares that
followed him home

00:49.050 --> 00:52.017
were as disturbing as
they were persistent.

01:23.250 --> 01:26.151
Naturally, and like
so many of his ilk,

01:26.153 --> 01:29.488
Paul was driven to the bottle
to help douse the fireworks

01:29.490 --> 01:30.689
between his ears.

01:36.263 --> 01:37.996
Unfortunately, it
didn't work so well.

01:42.002 --> 01:45.471
And before long he found
himself broken, homeless,

01:45.473 --> 01:46.972
and without prospects.

01:55.316 --> 01:58.283
Fortunately, Paul had
a younger sister, Jill,

01:58.285 --> 02:00.752
who generously offered
up her home and sofa

02:00.754 --> 02:02.688
until Paul could
get back on his feet

02:02.690 --> 02:05.190
and regain some respectability.

02:05.192 --> 02:08.193
But her hospitality did not
come without its own set

02:08.195 --> 02:10.128
of rules and regulations.

02:11.298 --> 02:12.364
What'd I tell you?

02:14.301 --> 02:17.469
I let you stay here, but
the one rule was no booze

02:18.339 --> 02:19.339
and no guns.

02:21.008 --> 02:22.474
I can even deal with girls,

02:23.777 --> 02:26.645
except those with booze or guns.

02:30.050 --> 02:31.050
I'll take that.

02:36.023 --> 02:38.690
As strict as
Jill's rules might have seemed,

02:38.692 --> 02:41.994
Paul had little choice and
fewer options but to abide

02:41.996 --> 02:44.396
by the lady of the house
no matter how difficult

02:44.398 --> 02:47.232
she made it to get
by, day by day.

02:54.642 --> 02:57.209
Okay, we're gonna make a
new rule, no smoking inside...

03:02.416 --> 03:05.284
She comforted
him and cared for him,

03:05.286 --> 03:07.452
and then she offered
even more help.

03:10.491 --> 03:11.590
As it turned out,

03:11.592 --> 03:13.926
Jill had recently met a doctor.

03:13.928 --> 03:17.863
She's not a doctor,
she's a therapist.

03:17.865 --> 03:21.900
She specializes in addiction
and this sort of thing.

03:23.237 --> 03:25.871
I thought of you when I
met her, so I got her card.

03:27.975 --> 03:29.675
I'm making you an appointment.

03:29.677 --> 03:31.910
Sometimes
the most friendly voices

03:31.912 --> 03:34.012
say the hardest things to hear.

03:34.014 --> 03:35.214
Hello?

03:35.216 --> 03:36.949
Yeah, Cassie Wright, please.

03:50.231 --> 03:51.163
Hi Paul.

03:51.165 --> 03:51.964
It's really nice to meet you.

03:51.966 --> 03:53.098
I'm Cassie Wright.

03:54.268 --> 03:55.767
Um, just so you know, anything

03:55.769 --> 03:57.302
that we talk about today
- Reluctantly, Paul sat with

03:57.304 --> 03:58.837
- is strictly confidential.
- the very pregnant therapist

03:58.839 --> 04:00.105
and spoke about his problems.

04:00.107 --> 04:01.340
You can talk about
anything you want

04:01.342 --> 04:02.708
from the past,
- He told her

04:02.710 --> 04:03.942
any recent things,
about his drinking, the drugs.

04:03.944 --> 04:05.377
- your relationship
- But he spoke little

04:05.379 --> 04:06.612
with your mother,
of his incident overseas.

04:06.614 --> 04:08.313
your father, your
sister, you know,

04:08.315 --> 04:11.483
tennis teacher,
basketball coach.

04:11.485 --> 04:13.652
Whatever you're
comfortable talking about.

04:15.322 --> 04:20.392
Well, my first piece of advice
would be don't stop drinking

04:24.064 --> 04:25.063
at least not all at once.

04:25.065 --> 04:26.932
That would be a mistake.

04:26.934 --> 04:29.101
I bet you didn't expect
to hear that, huh?

04:31.272 --> 04:33.572
You can't
just quit cold turkey,

04:33.574 --> 04:36.775
as you've discovered,
physically, mentally,

04:37.911 --> 04:39.978
just because of the
void that it leaves.

04:41.081 --> 04:43.482
You have to replace
it with something.

04:43.484 --> 04:46.585
Something has to fill
that need and that time,

04:48.055 --> 04:50.555
something less destructive.

04:55.596 --> 04:56.996
What about sex?

04:56.997 --> 04:58.397
You see, I could prescribe
a slew of medications

04:58.399 --> 05:02.567
and so forth, but it
has been my experience

05:02.569 --> 05:06.271
with most people,
especially men of your age,

05:08.142 --> 05:09.741
that they just need a good lay.

05:12.379 --> 05:14.813
How have things
been in that regard

05:14.815 --> 05:16.348
since you've been back?

05:16.350 --> 05:17.482
The lay regard.

05:19.453 --> 05:21.653
Satisfied, frustrated?

05:22.523 --> 05:23.555
None of the above?

05:24.958 --> 05:26.358
No.

05:26.360 --> 05:30.362
It has been my experience
that a little lay

05:30.364 --> 05:33.265
can solve a lotta big problems.

05:35.736 --> 05:37.903
Well, for the
depression and drinking

05:37.905 --> 05:39.971
I can prescribe Naltrexone,

05:39.973 --> 05:41.940
but you would have to go to
the lab and get blood work done

05:41.942 --> 05:44.009
so we could see where
your liver stands.

05:45.746 --> 05:47.579
Have you ever
thought about fetish?

05:48.916 --> 05:51.650
I only ask because it
seems like you might have

05:51.652 --> 05:55.253
and I do realize that
appearances can be deceiving,

05:55.255 --> 05:58.590
but it's
also been my experience

05:58.592 --> 06:00.826
that they can't
be that deceiving.

06:02.062 --> 06:04.563
I know that in the proverbial
shed there are tools

06:04.565 --> 06:09.634
that may be sharper than
I, but I have been known

06:10.738 --> 06:12.771
to have a keen sense
on this sort of thing.

06:14.575 --> 06:16.041
Of course, maybe you
don't know exactly

06:16.043 --> 06:18.143
what you need just yet.

06:18.145 --> 06:22.447
Maybe you just need an ear
and/or some medication.

06:25.586 --> 06:28.553
But the Denver Fetlife is
nothing to turn your nose up at.

06:29.923 --> 06:31.423
You know, there are these
websites that I've heard of.

06:31.425 --> 06:35.694
Fet-Den-Life is a good
one and DenFet is another

06:37.331 --> 06:39.398
to coordinate meetings
and set up gatherings

06:39.400 --> 06:40.766
and dates and such.

06:42.569 --> 06:44.202
It's not all about sex.

06:44.204 --> 06:47.472
I mean sometimes it's about
submission or domination.

06:48.809 --> 06:50.409
They'll take over a church
and turn the basement

06:50.411 --> 06:52.010
into rows of cages.

06:52.012 --> 06:54.246
No penetration,
strictly role playing.

06:55.582 --> 06:57.516
And if you don't have
toys of your own,

06:57.518 --> 07:00.152
you usually can rent
them right there.

07:00.154 --> 07:02.687
And I know the idea of
renting used sex toys

07:02.689 --> 07:06.491
may be suspect at
best, but I mean,

07:06.493 --> 07:08.393
everything can be
disinfected, right?

07:11.231 --> 07:13.932
As the very
pregnant therapist spoke...

07:15.269 --> 07:20.305
Toilet play, baby cages,
hook suspension, rope bondage.

07:21.575 --> 07:23.108
Paul
couldn't shake the feeling

07:23.110 --> 07:25.710
that he was learning much more
about her than she about him.

07:26.947 --> 07:30.949
There is something
else I've heard about,

07:30.951 --> 07:32.851
something very different.

07:35.556 --> 07:37.456
I'm going to prescribe
you something.

07:38.625 --> 07:41.526
This is something I
only prescribe

07:41.528 --> 07:43.695
to my special cases.

07:43.697 --> 07:48.066
And I think you might
just be that special.

07:51.605 --> 07:52.871
This is my card.

07:54.575 --> 07:59.177
On the back
I'm going to write

07:59.179 --> 08:01.446
an address and a password.

08:03.116 --> 08:04.649
Password?

08:04.651 --> 08:07.552
You give the password to the
doorman when you get there.

08:07.554 --> 08:09.654
This is for tomorrow night.

08:09.656 --> 08:13.859
Take it or leave it, but I
think you really need to get out

08:13.861 --> 08:16.428
and this might
just be the thing.

08:20.033 --> 08:22.601
Do yourself a favor,
show up tomorrow

08:22.603 --> 08:26.471
and let your curiosity
get the best of you.

08:41.488 --> 08:44.322
After serious
consideration of his position

08:44.324 --> 08:46.791
and deliberation of his options,

08:46.793 --> 08:49.027
Paul arrived at a conclusion.

08:56.670 --> 08:59.337
He decided to fill
his prescription.

10:45.879 --> 10:46.879
Rondo?

11:45.105 --> 11:46.105
Gentlemen.

11:46.907 --> 11:48.106
Hello.

11:48.108 --> 11:49.607
Welcome.

11:49.609 --> 11:53.812
Please, join me in the
kitchen area, if you would.

12:04.624 --> 12:05.724
I'm Lurdell.

12:06.993 --> 12:10.095
And it's my pleasure
to introduce Mr. Tim.

12:11.198 --> 12:15.500
It's his party and it's
our job to facilitate

12:15.502 --> 12:17.969
his feelings of enjoyment.

12:19.439 --> 12:21.506
He has commissioned us
for a very specific brand

12:21.508 --> 12:24.008
of good time and it's up to us

12:24.010 --> 12:25.577
to fulfill those expectations.

12:27.647 --> 12:28.980
This is Mrs. Tim.

12:30.283 --> 12:34.219
She is a willing and
able co-conspirator

12:35.555 --> 12:39.023
in the job of work to
which we have been tasked.

12:39.993 --> 12:40.993
Fine?

12:42.829 --> 12:44.362
Okay.

12:44.364 --> 12:49.434
First of all, condoms
will not be encouraged.

12:50.003 --> 12:51.569
Fuckin' A.

12:51.571 --> 12:55.840
What is encouraged is that
your inevitable ejaculation

12:55.842 --> 12:59.110
occur inside Mrs. Tim's person.

12:59.112 --> 13:04.082
Where inside Mrs. Tim's person
is not so much a concern

13:04.885 --> 13:07.986
as that it is inside her person.

13:07.988 --> 13:12.257
And if that's not possible,
for whatever reason,

13:12.259 --> 13:17.328
any exterior orgasms should
be achieved, preferably,

13:18.131 --> 13:19.864
on the exterior of Mrs. Tim.

13:20.967 --> 13:25.570
Or, at the very least,
stay on the plastic.

13:26.706 --> 13:30.108
Stay on the plastic.

13:33.880 --> 13:36.881
Position changes
only when requested.

13:36.883 --> 13:38.383
What?

13:38.385 --> 13:40.852
If you wanna get blow-jobbed,

13:40.854 --> 13:43.388
you must ask Mr.
Tim's permission.

13:44.457 --> 13:48.259
As per Mr. Tim's wishes,
nothing will be left

13:48.261 --> 13:50.728
to Mrs. Tim's discretion.

13:50.730 --> 13:55.066
So feel free to
disregard her requests

13:55.068 --> 13:57.335
and ignore her
wishes altogether.

13:58.205 --> 13:59.804
It's all part of the fun.

14:00.707 --> 14:02.373
Throat fuck?

14:02.375 --> 14:06.377
Yes, but don't just hop up

14:06.379 --> 14:08.446
and straddle her
head out of the blue.

14:09.616 --> 14:11.783
Either wait until
it's requested,

14:12.886 --> 14:16.754
or give a warning of
at least two seconds.

14:19.793 --> 14:23.695
Anal is, of course, wonderful.

14:24.764 --> 14:28.933
Anal is permitted
and encouraged often,

14:30.170 --> 14:34.138
but again, at the
request of Mr. Tim

14:34.140 --> 14:37.175
to whom sequence
is of importance.

14:38.378 --> 14:41.713
And, gentlemen,
please, be gentle.

14:43.016 --> 14:46.117
That is, unless
otherwise instructed

14:46.119 --> 14:48.553
by Mr. Tim or myself.

14:49.656 --> 14:53.491
Spitting on Mrs.
Tim, biting Mrs. Tim,

14:53.493 --> 14:58.363
slapping Mrs. Tim, or
otherwise degrading Mrs. Tim

14:59.232 --> 15:00.598
is perfectly acceptable.

15:01.768 --> 15:05.904
Teeth marks, scratches,
bruises are encouraged,

15:05.906 --> 15:07.305
but not mandatory.

15:08.341 --> 15:10.008
A little blood
never hurt anybody.

15:10.777 --> 15:12.210
But stay on the plastic.

15:14.180 --> 15:18.683
As far as any other toys that
you may have brought with you,

15:18.685 --> 15:22.387
feel free to use them,
but be realistic.

15:23.790 --> 15:26.157
There's only so much Mrs.
Tim can fit inside of her.

15:27.994 --> 15:31.296
She's not an acrobat
or an astronaut.

15:32.999 --> 15:33.999
She's a lady.

15:35.435 --> 15:36.634
And no weird shit.

15:46.813 --> 15:49.314
Okay, you can take her in.

16:29.689 --> 16:32.690
There's one last piece
of business, gentlemen,

16:32.692 --> 16:34.225
and that's confidentiality.

16:35.528 --> 16:36.894
And it's important.

16:39.132 --> 16:43.701
These are strict
confidentiality contracts.

16:44.771 --> 16:48.539
These require your
name, address,

16:48.541 --> 16:50.208
and your signature.

16:50.210 --> 16:54.212
When you finish,
please be good enough

16:54.214 --> 16:56.381
to give your phones to DeShawn.

16:57.283 --> 16:58.516

Hey!

26:01.527 --> 26:03.527
Watch the fuck out, dick!

26:36.128 --> 26:38.262
Go outside, call Tyrus.

28:43.589 --> 28:46.023
Paul told
his sister everything.

28:46.025 --> 28:47.691
He spared no detail.

28:47.693 --> 28:49.226
What's goin' on?

28:49.228 --> 28:51.061
Naturally, for
a man of Paul's credibility,

28:51.063 --> 28:52.896
he was met with skepticism.

28:53.699 --> 28:54.965
You're gonna wind up in the VA

28:54.967 --> 28:57.000
right next to Dad if you
don't pull it together.

28:59.939 --> 29:03.307
If it is true, then you
need to call the police.

29:10.149 --> 29:12.382
Paul did,
indeed, call the police.

29:12.384 --> 29:13.851
All right, sir.

29:13.853 --> 29:15.919
We appreciate your information
and someone will follow up

29:15.921 --> 29:17.821
with you as soon as possible.

29:17.823 --> 29:20.157
Thank you for your
assistance in this matter.

29:21.660 --> 29:23.160
And the therapist.

29:23.162 --> 29:24.895
You've reached
the office of Cassie Wright.

29:24.897 --> 29:27.464
She's currently in an
appointment or unavailable.

29:27.466 --> 29:30.367
If this is an emergency,
please dial the Rose Medical...

29:32.671 --> 29:34.238
Both to no avail.

29:36.075 --> 29:38.742
Although, to Paul's
credit, the officer said

29:38.744 --> 29:42.079
it was the best call they
had received in many weeks.

29:43.482 --> 29:46.717
The body of
an as yet unidentified female

29:46.719 --> 29:50.387
and those of two unidentified
males were discovered

29:50.389 --> 29:53.090
in the early hours of this
morning on the east bank

29:53.092 --> 29:56.326
of the Platte River just
outside of downtown Denver.

29:56.328 --> 29:59.263
Early forensic evidence
indicates that the two males

29:59.265 --> 30:03.133
were engaged in a sexual
assault before the young woman

30:03.135 --> 30:05.736
bravely turned the
tables on her attackers

30:05.738 --> 30:07.471
and attempted to fight back.

30:09.108 --> 30:10.541
- Just listen.
- What...

30:10.543 --> 30:12.042
I think I figured it out.

30:13.312 --> 30:14.244
Paul
explained his new

30:14.246 --> 30:15.913
and exciting theories for Jill.

30:17.283 --> 30:19.950
He broke down the chain
of events, as he saw them,

30:19.952 --> 30:21.785
from back to front.

30:21.787 --> 30:23.287
What else do you remember?

30:24.990 --> 30:26.156
What apartment was it?

30:27.193 --> 30:28.358
12 something.

30:29.428 --> 30:30.428
No, wait.

30:31.764 --> 30:36.333
I remember the number, 1216.

30:37.736 --> 30:38.736
What else?

30:40.840 --> 30:44.508
I remember knives

30:44.510 --> 30:47.311
and tools in the sink.

30:50.282 --> 30:53.050
I mean, for all I know, we were
the third round that night.

30:57.756 --> 30:59.790
And the woman was
drugged from the start.

31:00.960 --> 31:02.326
With what, I don't know.

31:02.328 --> 31:04.394
Probably something
that can't be traced,

31:06.432 --> 31:07.798
but it did the job on her.

31:11.203 --> 31:14.037
So this
all means that...

31:14.039 --> 31:15.138
Just listen.

31:18.244 --> 31:20.310
So it's a rich, older husband

31:21.547 --> 31:23.480
and an attractive,
much younger wife.

31:24.817 --> 31:27.217
She's cheating on him,
getting somewhere else

31:27.219 --> 31:28.685
what she can't get from him.

31:30.723 --> 31:31.822
Only he's sick of it.

31:33.392 --> 31:36.226
But knocking her off isn't
good enough for this guy.

31:36.228 --> 31:39.329
He's humiliated and he's
not pleased about it.

31:40.666 --> 31:44.134
Nothing will be left
to Mrs. Tim's discretion.

31:45.204 --> 31:48.772
So feel free to
disregard her requests

31:48.774 --> 31:51.275
and ignore her
wishes altogether.

31:52.111 --> 31:53.911
It's all part of the fun.

31:55.314 --> 31:57.814
And he wants to see
her fucked by strange men.

31:58.951 --> 32:01.952
Anal is,
of course, wonderful.

32:01.954 --> 32:04.922
Anal is permitted
and encouraged often.

32:06.025 --> 32:07.257
And then
he wants to see

32:07.259 --> 32:10.727
the men who fucked her
killed unpleasantly.

32:13.198 --> 32:16.400
Before he offs her.

32:19.004 --> 32:20.004
Why?

32:21.840 --> 32:22.940
Because he's pissed.

32:24.643 --> 32:25.876
Because it's his thing.

32:27.212 --> 32:29.313
Or he's pissed and
that's his thing.

32:29.315 --> 32:30.847
It doesn't matter.

32:30.849 --> 32:33.917
But Mr. Tim is just a money guy.

32:35.020 --> 32:37.154
He doesn't coordinate
this kind of thing.

32:43.028 --> 32:45.862
So he hires these folks to
put it all together for him.

32:47.232 --> 32:50.734
God knows how, but money has
a way of finding a pocket

32:50.736 --> 32:52.836
no matter what it has
to do to get there.

33:07.987 --> 33:10.554
They wanted as much physical
evidence as possible.

33:11.690 --> 33:16.093
First of all, condoms
will not be encouraged.

33:16.095 --> 33:17.095
Why?

33:18.330 --> 33:22.933
Teeth marks, scratches,
bruises are encouraged

33:22.935 --> 33:24.468
but not mandatory.

33:24.470 --> 33:26.870
So they could just
dump the bodies in the river

33:26.872 --> 33:27.938
and be done with it.

33:28.774 --> 33:30.607
The killers and the killed,

33:30.609 --> 33:33.677
an open and shut
case, neatly wrapped.

33:33.679 --> 33:35.445
This doesn't make any sense.

33:36.515 --> 33:38.415
I'm supposed to be
dead in the river, too.

33:40.619 --> 33:42.452
And I was sent
there by the doctor.

33:44.323 --> 33:47.257
With the address
and the password.

33:50.429 --> 33:52.129
I mean for all I know
she was just plucking

33:52.131 --> 33:53.930
the ideal losers for the task.

33:55.234 --> 33:56.433
People no one would care about.

33:56.435 --> 34:00.070
People with a history.

34:01.473 --> 34:04.241
So now you're saying the
doctor was in on it, too?

34:07.446 --> 34:08.446
What?

34:10.882 --> 34:12.049
You knew the doctor.

34:14.152 --> 34:16.620
You made the appointment
and you sent me to her.

34:17.422 --> 34:18.422
Hello?

34:19.491 --> 34:20.924
Cassie Wright, please.

34:22.194 --> 34:24.061
Wait, wait, wait.

34:26.598 --> 34:27.598
You're losing it.

34:28.333 --> 34:29.966
You're cracking up again.

36:15.641 --> 36:17.340
Check out the
rest of the place.

36:19.244 --> 36:20.244
Okay.

40:23.288 --> 40:24.421
You okay?

40:25.424 --> 40:26.856
God, I hate white people.

40:29.728 --> 40:31.761
You bring the chain?

40:31.763 --> 40:32.762
I'll get it.

40:32.764 --> 40:33.764
Okay.

41:33.825 --> 41:38.228
I should be at home in bed
with my wife watchin' TV.

41:39.464 --> 41:41.664
Instead, here I am
dealin' with this.

41:43.702 --> 41:46.636
I mean, sometimes I just
get so frustrated, you know?

41:46.638 --> 41:48.338
Mmm hmm.

41:49.474 --> 41:51.474
I know I shouldn't
let things get to me.

41:52.444 --> 41:53.276
I know that.

41:53.278 --> 41:54.677
And I'm workin' on it

41:56.414 --> 41:57.881
but it ain't easy.

41:59.985 --> 42:02.051
You're just tryin'
to pursue your goals

42:02.053 --> 42:03.853
in the world of life.

42:03.855 --> 42:08.391
The memory of man runneth
not to the contrary.

42:08.393 --> 42:11.060
Okay?

42:11.830 --> 42:13.196
All right.

42:13.198 --> 42:14.597
One, two, three.

42:30.515 --> 42:34.350
Lurdell, look, he's
still twitchin' around.

42:44.262 --> 42:45.262
Okay.

43:35.647 --> 43:38.214
Good looking girl.

43:39.551 --> 43:43.519
So, two large black males
break into the house.

43:44.623 --> 43:46.522
Kill your brother.

43:46.524 --> 43:48.992
They don't take anything.

43:48.994 --> 43:50.893
The neighbors
don't see anything.

43:53.698 --> 43:55.832
Let's go over this again.

43:57.636 --> 44:02.138
Your brother was chemically
imbalanced and mentally unstable

44:02.140 --> 44:06.376
making prank calls to the
police about sex crimes.

44:11.016 --> 44:12.582
Was he into drugs?

44:15.353 --> 44:17.754
Did he have any new friends?

44:20.191 --> 44:23.026
Someone he might
have given a key to?

44:24.229 --> 44:27.630
Someone he might have
owed something to?

44:28.633 --> 44:30.833
And what about you?

44:30.835 --> 44:35.571
In the end, it is your house
they broke into last night.

44:38.176 --> 44:41.944
Did you have anything
to do with them?

44:41.946 --> 44:43.179
Finance goals?

44:46.551 --> 44:49.018
A good looking girl like you.

45:58.823 --> 45:59.823
Jillian.

46:01.426 --> 46:02.426
How are ya?

46:04.863 --> 46:07.163
So, did they let
me out of the VA?

46:09.033 --> 46:10.033
Close enough.

46:11.636 --> 46:13.102
Yeah, well, sort of.

46:14.472 --> 46:17.106
They came there and they
told me about, you know.

46:20.945 --> 46:23.012
Woulda rather heard
it from you, but...

46:25.116 --> 46:26.983
So I decided to...

46:28.887 --> 46:30.820
You shouldn't call
them or anything.

46:30.822 --> 46:32.321
I'll walk straight back in there

46:32.323 --> 46:34.190
as soon as this
mission is finished.

46:35.360 --> 46:36.392
You look different.

46:40.899 --> 46:42.198
Sound different, too.

46:43.301 --> 46:45.134
Used to be a talker
like your mother.

46:50.809 --> 46:52.708
You got anything to
drink around here?

47:11.830 --> 47:15.798
Vietnam wasn't my war,
it was my paradise.

47:15.800 --> 47:17.800
Where
else was I gonna go?

47:19.204 --> 47:22.805
For an FNG it was a nightmare,
but for a mud roller like me?

47:22.807 --> 47:25.775
It was more home than home
ever was, that's for damn sure.

47:27.512 --> 47:29.779
Next thing I know
I'm back stateside,

47:30.915 --> 47:33.983
with a dishonorable
and empty pockets,

47:33.985 --> 47:35.551
and a permanent bed at the VA.

47:46.297 --> 47:47.964
Jill told
her father everything

47:47.966 --> 47:49.532
that Paul had told her.

47:51.736 --> 47:54.170
That doesn't make a
lick of damn sense to me.

47:55.540 --> 47:57.306
Sure, there
were criminal enterprises,

47:57.308 --> 48:00.042
she explained, that
promised much easier

48:00.044 --> 48:03.779
and more lucrative returns,
but this group of miscreants

48:03.781 --> 48:06.549
were not so much
devoted to the profits

48:06.551 --> 48:08.951
as they were to the process.

48:08.953 --> 48:10.720
They enjoyed their work.

48:12.690 --> 48:13.823
Just tell me where.

48:27.372 --> 48:28.372
Rondo?

48:29.474 --> 48:30.673
Apartment 1216.

48:35.146 --> 48:36.846
And so
they devised a plan.

48:39.550 --> 48:42.385
Jill would confront the
therapist at her office.

48:46.624 --> 48:49.825
Her father would pay a visit
to the scene of the crime.

48:53.498 --> 48:55.298
All right, let's go.

48:58.236 --> 49:00.202
You need Paul's things?

49:00.204 --> 49:01.437
No.

49:01.439 --> 49:02.705
Brought my own gear.

49:40.712 --> 49:41.577
You've
reached the office

49:41.579 --> 49:43.012
of Cassie Wright.

49:43.014 --> 49:45.414
She's currently in an
appointment or unavailable.

49:45.416 --> 49:47.016
If this is an
emergency, please dial

49:47.018 --> 49:49.251
the Rose Medical Center...

50:05.269 --> 50:07.336
You've reached the
office of Cassie Wright.

50:07.338 --> 50:10.106
She's currently in an
appointment or unavailable.

50:10.108 --> 50:11.540
If this is an emergency,

50:11.542 --> 50:15.478
please dial the Rose Medical
Center Emergency Room.

51:22.246 --> 51:23.246
Yes?

51:27.251 --> 51:28.251
Yes?

51:29.821 --> 51:31.887
Oh, yes, sorry, uh...

51:37.862 --> 51:38.862
Yes?

51:41.566 --> 51:42.566
Can I help you?

51:46.704 --> 51:47.704
Come in.

51:53.377 --> 51:55.578
Uh, I'm not sellin'
anything or anything.

51:55.580 --> 51:57.813
I was just, uh,
lookin' for somebody

51:57.815 --> 52:00.349
that I thought
mighta lived here.

52:01.385 --> 52:02.451
Me.

52:02.453 --> 52:04.186
Not you.

52:04.188 --> 52:05.188
You live here.

52:06.324 --> 52:07.356
Yeah, sorry.

52:08.493 --> 52:11.660
No, uh, my daughter,
she, uh, said that...

52:11.662 --> 52:13.762
You're looking
for your daughter?

52:13.764 --> 52:15.831
No, not my daughter.

52:15.833 --> 52:18.000
Uh, someone that she said, uh...

52:20.671 --> 52:22.104
I'm sorry.

52:22.106 --> 52:24.373
I don't understand.

52:24.375 --> 52:25.975
I'm looking for Cassie Wright.

52:25.977 --> 52:29.778
She's a doctor who specializes
in addiction therapy.

52:29.780 --> 52:31.714
Well, you're half
right and half wrong.

52:31.716 --> 52:34.850
I am Cassie Wright and I do
specialize in addiction therapy,

52:34.852 --> 52:36.519
but I'm not a doctor.

52:36.521 --> 52:38.988
I'm an APRN CNS.

52:38.990 --> 52:40.189
You're Cassie Wright?

52:42.460 --> 52:44.994
Then who was the woman
who was using this office?

52:46.097 --> 52:47.763
Well, no one
else uses this office.

52:47.765 --> 52:49.598
This is my office.

52:49.600 --> 52:51.567
Then who was the
woman who I met,

52:51.569 --> 52:53.335
who saw my brother
here last week?

52:54.405 --> 52:55.538
Oh, I see.

52:56.674 --> 52:58.807
Obviously, we have
a misunderstanding.

52:58.809 --> 53:01.577
You see, I was in Chicago
for the last two months

53:01.579 --> 53:03.746
and I haven't been
taking any new patients.

53:04.682 --> 53:05.948
I'm sorry.

53:05.950 --> 53:07.310
I don't know what
else to tell you.

53:10.121 --> 53:12.555
Like I said, I haven't been
taking any new patients,

53:12.557 --> 53:15.124
but I can see, in your case,

53:15.126 --> 53:17.726
it might be necessary
to make an exception.

53:17.728 --> 53:19.361
I'm awful sorry
about this, ma'am.

53:19.363 --> 53:22.798
I guess we musta got our
wires crossed or something.

53:22.800 --> 53:24.033
Oh, okay.

53:24.035 --> 53:25.467
I'm in the wrong
place or something.

53:25.469 --> 53:26.969
Probably.

53:26.971 --> 53:29.605
Maybe, uh, you don't mind,
though, if I just ask you,

53:29.607 --> 53:32.808
I'm sorry, it's just that I
came a long ways and everything.

53:32.810 --> 53:36.245
Uh, I don't know how well
you know your neighbors.

53:37.648 --> 53:39.114
Mmm.

53:39.116 --> 53:40.516
I don't mean to bother you.

53:40.518 --> 53:42.985
I feel real bad about
takin' up your time

53:42.987 --> 53:45.821
in your condition and whatnot,

53:45.823 --> 53:49.658
but, uh, you don't by any
chance know a Mr. Rondo, do ya?

53:53.331 --> 53:54.396
If not, it's okay.

53:54.398 --> 53:56.332
I'll just go, but uh...

53:56.334 --> 53:59.235
No, you know, why don't
you just come in for a minute

53:59.237 --> 54:00.402
and you figure it out.

54:00.404 --> 54:01.637
Oh, no, no, no.

54:01.639 --> 54:03.439
I've taken up enough
of your time already.

54:03.441 --> 54:04.707
No, no, no, come on in.

54:04.709 --> 54:05.941
Just a minute.

54:05.943 --> 54:08.344
Well, uh, uh, maybe
just for a minute then.

54:08.346 --> 54:09.678
Yeah.

54:09.680 --> 54:11.113
Come on.

54:11.115 --> 54:12.615
It's all it's gonna take.

54:16.187 --> 54:18.220
Now, you'll have to forgive me.

54:18.222 --> 54:21.457
I was just on the verge
of falling asleep.

54:21.459 --> 54:23.826
Oh, I'm awful
sorry about that.

54:23.828 --> 54:25.227
Oh, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

54:25.229 --> 54:26.528
It's fine.

54:26.530 --> 54:29.098
I'm always on the
verge of, you know.

54:29.900 --> 54:32.167
You just have to bear with me.

54:32.169 --> 54:33.836
I'm sorry to
bother you like this.

54:33.838 --> 54:37.273
How well do you know the other
folks who live on this floor?

54:37.275 --> 54:39.608
Well, uh, we've been
here a few months,

54:39.610 --> 54:42.378
but we're planning on
moving soon, you know,

54:42.380 --> 54:46.315
to a place with more
space for family.

54:46.317 --> 54:47.317
Hey!

54:49.020 --> 54:50.753
What the fuck!

54:50.755 --> 54:52.121
- Go ahead, grab him, honey.
- Okay, God damn it!

54:52.123 --> 54:54.456
Don't break a
fuckin' hip, honey.

54:54.458 --> 54:56.191
You son of a bitch!

54:56.193 --> 54:57.860
You old fuck.

54:57.862 --> 54:59.395
Communist.

54:59.397 --> 55:00.329
Ah!

55:00.331 --> 55:01.764
Get your hands off me.

55:01.766 --> 55:04.667
That's my
husband, not a communist.

55:05.936 --> 55:06.769
God damn it.

55:06.771 --> 55:07.936
You mother fucker!

55:07.938 --> 55:10.205
Get your hands off me!

55:10.207 --> 55:11.040
Damn it!

55:11.042 --> 55:13.542
Go ahead.

55:13.544 --> 55:14.544
Ow!

55:33.097 --> 55:35.731
God, you crazy bitch!

55:35.733 --> 55:37.333
God damn it!

56:00.891 --> 56:04.293
One minute.

56:33.958 --> 56:37.393
Honey, be a doll and
take the batteries

56:37.395 --> 56:41.296
out of the smoke detectors
and open all the windows.

01:01:16.006 --> 01:01:17.006
Yes?

01:01:19.143 --> 01:01:20.143
Can I help you?

01:01:24.148 --> 01:01:25.148
Rondo.

01:01:29.787 --> 01:01:31.086
Okay.

01:01:31.088 --> 01:01:32.088
Won't you come in?

01:01:42.900 --> 01:01:44.399
Excuse me, ma'am.

01:01:53.944 --> 01:01:54.944
Hmm.

01:01:56.547 --> 01:02:01.016
See, never know, do you?

01:02:01.018 --> 01:02:02.584
That was my thought.

01:02:02.586 --> 01:02:06.388
The memory of man runneth
not to the contrary.

01:02:06.390 --> 01:02:08.023
Can we talk business now?

01:02:08.025 --> 01:02:09.891
Of course.

01:02:09.893 --> 01:02:12.794
There's nothing I would
like more in the world

01:02:12.796 --> 01:02:15.564
than to talk to
you about business.

01:02:16.366 --> 01:02:18.767
After you, Miss.

01:02:18.769 --> 01:02:19.968
Jill.

01:02:19.970 --> 01:02:21.269
After you, Miss Jill.

01:02:28.112 --> 01:02:33.115
So how'd you come
upon our little shop?

01:02:33.951 --> 01:02:36.351
The Therapist.

01:02:36.353 --> 01:02:37.819
Mmm hmm, I see.

01:02:39.123 --> 01:02:40.956
She gave me the
address and the password.

01:02:41.892 --> 01:02:42.892
Mmm hmm.

01:02:43.694 --> 01:02:45.794
So, what can I do for you?

01:02:47.798 --> 01:02:52.334
Miss Jill, I'm afraid
I can't help unless I know...

01:02:52.336 --> 01:02:55.570
I understand that you
provide special services.

01:02:55.572 --> 01:02:57.439
Services of a unique kind.

01:02:58.776 --> 01:03:00.375
It's also my understanding
that these services

01:03:00.377 --> 01:03:01.409
come at a premium.

01:03:02.913 --> 01:03:06.281
But a premium is what I'm willing
to pay for these services,

01:03:06.283 --> 01:03:08.116
these services
being what they are.

01:03:09.319 --> 01:03:10.319
Unique.

01:03:14.124 --> 01:03:16.792
And what services
can we provide?

01:03:41.351 --> 01:03:45.120
Are you looking for
the basic package,

01:03:45.122 --> 01:03:49.057
or did you have something
more custom-tailored in mind?

01:03:49.059 --> 01:03:51.259
We try to accommodate all needs

01:03:51.261 --> 01:03:53.061
and all manner of fulfillment.

01:03:54.198 --> 01:03:56.464
What's thought by
some to be strange

01:03:56.466 --> 01:03:58.567
or out of the ordinary

01:03:58.569 --> 01:03:59.968
makes no difference to us.

01:03:59.970 --> 01:04:01.136
Good.

01:04:01.138 --> 01:04:03.071
That's what I've been told.

01:04:03.073 --> 01:04:05.040
Ordinary is not the
thing that I want.

01:04:06.410 --> 01:04:07.843
I want the other thing.

01:04:09.246 --> 01:04:11.213
Have you been
checking up on me?

01:04:14.518 --> 01:04:15.518
Let's go inside.

01:04:21.692 --> 01:04:26.561
Now is the question
of the subject.

01:04:28.465 --> 01:04:31.900
You have to tell me who
will be the feature star

01:04:31.902 --> 01:04:33.101
of this production?

01:04:34.671 --> 01:04:36.238
Is it your boyfriend?

01:04:37.074 --> 01:04:38.074
Girlfriend?

01:04:39.443 --> 01:04:40.976
Is this for a birthday party?

01:04:41.912 --> 01:04:42.912
An anniversary?

01:04:44.815 --> 01:04:47.482
So, who will it be?

01:04:49.453 --> 01:04:50.752
Me.

01:05:04.134 --> 01:05:05.134
Okay.

01:05:08.105 --> 01:05:12.574
Why don't you tell me exactly
what you require of us,

01:05:15.045 --> 01:05:16.228
if you don't mind?

01:05:16.229 --> 01:05:18.269
Yes, I understand you
prefer a detailed breakdown.

01:05:18.849 --> 01:05:21.116
Please, don't be shy.

01:05:26.256 --> 01:05:28.089
Anal would have to come first,

01:05:28.892 --> 01:05:30.292
like a good ice-breaker,

01:05:31.628 --> 01:05:35.630
followed by being spanked,
slapped, hit, and hair-pulled.

01:05:35.632 --> 01:05:37.098
These can't happen before

01:05:37.100 --> 01:05:39.668
because what would I have
done to deserve them?

01:05:41.138 --> 01:05:43.405
At some point, I'll
need to be tied up.

01:05:44.708 --> 01:05:46.308
I can't tell you the
exact moment except to say

01:05:46.310 --> 01:05:48.777
it's when I get excited
about using my hands.

01:05:50.080 --> 01:05:52.647
At that turning point, I
should not be allowed to do so

01:05:52.649 --> 01:05:54.716
and should be put in
my place accordingly

01:05:54.718 --> 01:05:58.119
with not leather or
silk, but twine rope.

01:05:59.489 --> 01:06:01.122
Something that burns with
my every move and reminds me

01:06:01.124 --> 01:06:03.024
just how badly I've
crossed the line.

01:06:04.328 --> 01:06:07.329
In regards to the performers
that you commission,

01:06:07.331 --> 01:06:09.698
size is of some importance,

01:06:10.801 --> 01:06:12.968
that size being large.

01:06:12.970 --> 01:06:14.469
None of this is going
to mean a thing to me

01:06:14.471 --> 01:06:17.272
unless I feel I'm being
used by big dicks.

01:06:17.274 --> 01:06:18.340
Of course.

01:06:19.509 --> 01:06:22.344
At least five,
preferably more.

01:06:23.680 --> 01:06:27.182
The thing I have a real
problem with are dead-spots,

01:06:27.184 --> 01:06:29.584
those moments of awkward
fumbling confusion

01:06:29.586 --> 01:06:32.220
as we move from one
tent-pole event to the next.

01:06:33.724 --> 01:06:36.958
I implore you to make
organization priority number one,

01:06:36.960 --> 01:06:39.761
because all it takes is one
of these 30-second lapses

01:06:39.763 --> 01:06:43.398
to destroy my concentration,
my whole experience,

01:06:43.400 --> 01:06:46.334
and make me less inclined
to pay out on the backend.

01:07:00.117 --> 01:07:03.018
I'll most likely bring my
own materials and equipment,

01:07:03.020 --> 01:07:05.954
which I expect to be used on
me in the prearranged order

01:07:05.956 --> 01:07:08.223
and fashion that I instruct,

01:07:08.225 --> 01:07:12.160
but also to be returned to me
without being cleaned, washed,

01:07:12.162 --> 01:07:14.462
wiped, or anything else
that could prevent me

01:07:14.464 --> 01:07:17.832
from reliving the experience
again and again and again.

01:07:19.102 --> 01:07:20.702
I like to get my money's worth.

01:07:21.972 --> 01:07:24.639
Now, the tricky part

01:07:24.641 --> 01:07:26.708
is that I don't want
any of them to cum.

01:07:27.811 --> 01:07:28.777
And I don't mean
I don't want them

01:07:28.779 --> 01:07:31.112
to cum in me or on me.

01:07:31.114 --> 01:07:33.048
I don't want them to cum period.

01:07:34.151 --> 01:07:36.017
Part of my satisfaction
involves the knowledge

01:07:36.019 --> 01:07:39.854
that I was never able to bring
any of my lovers to orgasm,

01:07:39.856 --> 01:07:42.023
or give them any
pleasure, really, at all.

01:07:43.427 --> 01:07:45.326
Now, I'm well aware that
this makes it a tough sell

01:07:45.328 --> 01:07:47.896
for your employees,
which is another reason

01:07:47.898 --> 01:07:50.665
I'm willing to pay what
I'm willing to pay.

01:07:50.667 --> 01:07:52.967
And for what I'm willing
to pay, they can go home

01:07:52.969 --> 01:07:55.437
and jerk off, counting
their money the whole way

01:07:55.439 --> 01:07:56.439
for all I care.

01:07:58.141 --> 01:07:59.141
Fine?

01:08:00.844 --> 01:08:05.914
On the flip-side, if I
don't cum, all bets are off.

01:08:07.350 --> 01:08:08.817
This has happened in the past

01:08:08.819 --> 01:08:11.986
where my semi-professional
suitors have simply given up.

01:08:13.090 --> 01:08:15.523
For this, you'll keep
your half up front,

01:08:15.525 --> 01:08:17.292
but get nothing on the backside.

01:08:18.295 --> 01:08:20.395
That's if the
details of my routine

01:08:20.397 --> 01:08:21.895
are not followed to a T.

01:08:32.075 --> 01:08:35.443
All of what you're saying
sounds perfectly doable.

01:08:46.990 --> 01:08:48.456
That's the sister.

01:08:51.495 --> 01:08:52.495
Oh, I know.

01:08:53.863 --> 01:08:55.830
We were just havin'
a little talk

01:08:55.832 --> 01:08:58.800
about what we're gonna
be doin' this evening.

01:09:01.037 --> 01:09:03.805
Nettie, call up our peoples.

01:09:05.108 --> 01:09:08.643
Tell them we're having a
special little party tonight.

01:09:11.581 --> 01:09:13.413
Then lay down the plastic.

01:09:25.462 --> 01:09:27.028
This is for you.

01:09:27.831 --> 01:09:29.130
Get up.

01:09:29.131 --> 01:09:30.131
Come on.

01:09:49.752 --> 01:09:51.051
Mmm.

01:09:53.723 --> 01:09:55.323
That's so

01:09:55.325 --> 01:09:56.325
Hi.

01:09:57.027 --> 01:09:58.626
Oh.

01:09:58.628 --> 01:09:59.961
Ooh.

01:09:59.963 --> 01:10:00.795
You all right, you all right?

01:10:00.797 --> 01:10:02.463
Mmm hmm.

01:10:03.633 --> 01:10:04.993
What are you
still doin' dressed?

01:10:07.904 --> 01:10:09.137
Oh.

01:10:09.139 --> 01:10:10.505
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:10:10.507 --> 01:10:11.339
Did you?

01:10:12.742 --> 01:10:16.344
Sometimes I get mad at
someone for not doing something.

01:10:16.346 --> 01:10:18.813
Then I remember, I didn't
tell them to do it.

01:10:20.917 --> 01:10:21.849
My fault.

01:10:21.851 --> 01:10:22.684
Yeah.

01:10:22.686 --> 01:10:23.918
Now get up and strip.

01:10:25.422 --> 01:10:26.221
Hmm.

01:10:28.425 --> 01:10:29.425
That's right.

01:10:30.126 --> 01:10:32.927
All the way down to your undies.

01:10:34.097 --> 01:10:35.530
But you can leave those on.

01:10:36.833 --> 01:10:41.469
We have a guest or two
that likes a little undies.

01:10:49.145 --> 01:10:52.413
JR, I hope you're
payin' attention.

01:10:53.850 --> 01:10:55.783
It's not too soon to take
over the family business.

01:10:55.785 --> 01:10:57.919
Don't spoil him now.

01:10:57.921 --> 01:10:59.454
Keep stripping.

01:10:59.456 --> 01:11:02.657
It'll take some
time to work your way up.

01:11:04.894 --> 01:11:07.562
Don't just assume that
you can take our spots

01:11:07.564 --> 01:11:09.597
that easily, little boy.

01:11:12.802 --> 01:11:14.369
First an employee.

01:11:15.305 --> 01:11:17.038
Then a client.

01:11:17.040 --> 01:11:18.206
Then a performer.

01:11:18.208 --> 01:11:20.308
And eventually a CEO.

01:11:20.310 --> 01:11:21.909
Ooh

01:11:21.911 --> 01:11:24.579
But that won't be for
a long time now, right?

01:11:24.581 --> 01:11:26.047
Mmm hmm.

01:11:26.049 --> 01:11:27.015
We don't wanna
put any more pressure on him.

01:11:27.017 --> 01:11:28.249
No, no, no, no.

01:11:28.251 --> 01:11:29.183
We don't want to put any
more pressure on him.

01:11:29.185 --> 01:11:30.685
No, no.

01:11:30.687 --> 01:11:34.622
And he has to live up to the
standards that his daddy sets.

01:11:34.624 --> 01:11:36.057
No, no.

01:11:36.059 --> 01:11:39.327
He has to live up to the
standards that his mommy sets.

01:11:40.563 --> 01:11:42.463
No, no.

01:11:44.134 --> 01:11:47.869
Oh, wow, Mommy.

01:11:52.642 --> 01:11:54.409
What's goin' on?

01:11:54.411 --> 01:11:57.478
Hmm, something that
could use a little music.

01:11:59.349 --> 01:12:00.349
Okay.

01:12:02.719 --> 01:12:03.719
