Wait, is this...
I think this is our stop.

11:50.583 --> 11:53.917
Last call.
Passengers must disembark now.

Come on. This is our stop.
We got to get off.

11:57.792 --> 11:59.375
- What?
- Let's go.

11:59.375 --> 12:00.542
Grab our flowers.

12:00.542 --> 12:03.375
OK. All right.
I'll get the flowers.

12:07.166 --> 12:09.542
Thanks for the help, pal.

12:12.917 --> 12:15.291
Hey.

12:15.291 --> 12:19.166
Hey, thanks.
God, I think I pinched a nerve
getting off the train.

12:19.166 --> 12:21.333
Oh, come here. Let me try...

12:21.333 --> 12:23.208
Oh, I'm so glad
to be here finally.

12:23.208 --> 12:27.417
That's it. That's it.
That's the spot.
That's the spot. You got it.

12:28.875 --> 12:30.750
Dave?

12:30.750 --> 12:32.792
We're not at the
right station, are we?

12:32.792 --> 12:34.667
I don't think so.

12:34.667 --> 12:38.917
No! No! No! No! Stop the train!

I mean, can't you just
form an orderly line?
Didn't you go to grade school?

We really need one
of those red pulling

12:59.291 --> 13:03.166
- A dozen chocolate.
- A dozen chocolate.

13:03.166 --> 13:05.500
Uh, are you sure you
really need a dozen?

13:05.500 --> 13:09.458
Because that really seems
like a lot and you know,
it goes straight to your hips.

13:09.458 --> 13:12.333
I know. I want chocolate
frosting with vanilla cake.

13:12.333 --> 13:15.792

with the princess
and work somewhere else?

I'm not taking care
of three kids by myself. No.

Hey, hey. What if I
get someone to help you out?
I'll call Stephanie.

No. She already thinks I'm
a big enough idiot as it is.

in this fairy princess crap.

- Thanks, Laura.

[Adam] She is amazing. She's the
dog whisperer, but with kids.

16:47.959 --> 16:49.792
I know.
It's pretty impressive.

16:49.792 --> 16:51.750
How did you convince
her to come over?

16:51.750 --> 16:53.709
I didn't. I asked her
and she said yes.

16:53.709 --> 16:55.667
I had this feeling
she'd be great.

16:55.667 --> 16:58.500
She's got this thing about her,
the way she's so calm.

16:58.500 --> 17:00.667
- And I offered her
a hundred bucks.
- What?

17:00.667 --> 17:02.417
I'm just kidding, relax.

17:02.417 --> 17:05.000

for a picnic out on the patio?

17:08.792 --> 17:11.792
- I am! I am!
- I am! Me!

17:15.542 --> 17:17.041
I'm confused.

17:17.041 --> 17:19.417
Are you Brian's girlfriend

17:19.417 --> 17:22.625
or Molly Marmalade with the
blonde hair and the long legs?

17:22.625 --> 17:26.041
That's Stephanie. She's Brian's
girlfriend. We're just friends.

17:26.041 --> 17:28.917
Friends. Right.

17:28.917 --> 17:33.208
Anyway, I should
go back out there.

17:33.208 --> 17:36.792
I was that girl.
For a very long time.

17:36.792 --> 17:41.041
- Excuse me?
- You know,
the friend who's always there.

17:41.041 --> 17:45.834
The one who sits around
and waits for the guy
to call and does what he wants.

17:45.834 --> 17:47.959
Hoping one day that
he'll see the light.

17:47.959 --> 17:52.625
It took me seven years to
realize that my guy wasn't
going to see the light.

17:52.625 --> 17:56.083
He liked things fine
just the way they were.
Why wouldn't he, right?

17:56.083 --> 17:57.959
I'm sorry it didn't work out,

17:57.959 --> 18:01.417
but that has nothing to do
with me and Brian, so...

18:01.417 --> 18:07.166
Look, I don't know you,
but I do know Brian
just a little.

18:07.166 --> 18:09.959
And this is not going
to end the way you want.

18:09.959 --> 18:11.667
It's not a movie.

to have some big moment
where you save the day

18:14.417 --> 18:17.333
and he comes running
into your arms.

18:17.333 --> 18:21.500
You don't know that.
Friendships change.

18:21.500 --> 18:25.917
They get deeper,
more meaningful.
Not every situation is the same.

18:25.917 --> 18:29.000
OK. Sure.

18:29.000 --> 18:31.417
Maybe you're right.

18:31.417 --> 18:36.750
It does happen. If people
are open to it. I mean,
look at Adam and Nicole.

18:36.750 --> 18:40.250
They were friends forever,
since they were kids.
And then...

18:40.250 --> 18:42.917
- And then what?
- And then they slept together.

18:42.917 --> 18:45.166
I'm not even saying
I like Brian in that way.

18:45.166 --> 18:48.959
All I'm saying
is you could be wrong.

18:56.041 --> 18:58.375
- [rock music plays]
- Can I help the next customer?

18:58.375 --> 19:00.667
- Know if the
red velvet are wheat-free?
- No.

Can you find out? I could go
into anaphylactic shock.

19:03.458 --> 19:07.333
Then order something else.
Anyone else have any questions?

19:07.333 --> 19:09.625
- Are there pumpkin spice?
- You do birthdays?

19:09.625 --> 19:11.208
Can I special order
three dozen

19:11.208 --> 19:13.667
and have them frosted
like the Gay Pride flag?

19:15.125 --> 19:17.333
This so doesn't
feel like Ivy Day.

19:18.333 --> 19:21.875
Need my help yet? No?

19:21.875 --> 19:24.709
So, what's the deal, huh?

19:24.709 --> 19:28.667
You're sleeping
with Nicole, too?

19:28.667 --> 19:30.834
The last time I checked,
we're not a couple.

19:30.834 --> 19:32.917
So what's the problem?

19:32.917 --> 19:37.083
No, no. No problem.
I'm just just curious.

19:37.083 --> 19:38.834
Curious, or jealous?

19:38.834 --> 19:41.291
No, no, no.
See, I am not jealous.

19:41.291 --> 19:45.750
If anything, I'm a little
repulsed that you're sleeping
with other people

19:45.750 --> 19:49.125
- while sleeping with me.
- Whatever,
Miss "I'm Not Jealous."

19:49.125 --> 19:52.208
Adam. Excuse me. Excuse me.

19:52.208 --> 19:54.667
OK, I need help.
Stephanie's here.

19:54.667 --> 19:56.834
- So?
- So Laura's here
and now she's upset.

19:56.834 --> 19:59.500
- Laura?
- Stephanie.
I didn't call her first.

20:04.375 --> 20:05.542
Hey.

20:05.542 --> 20:07.917
I just don't understand.
I had all day free.

20:07.917 --> 20:09.709
Why didn't you
call me for help?

20:09.709 --> 20:12.709
I thought Laura would be good.
Well, more appropriate.

20:12.709 --> 20:16.083
I mean, just enjoy being
with the girls more.

20:16.083 --> 20:19.375
Are you saying that you don't
think that I'm good with kids?

20:19.375 --> 20:21.583
That's not it.
I'm not saying that at all.

20:21.583 --> 20:27.542
Because I am great with kids. I
have nieces, you know. Two.
Wait, three.

20:27.542 --> 20:29.792
And I'm sure
you're great with them.

20:29.792 --> 20:32.709
I am. I take them to get
mani/pedis all the time.

20:34.166 --> 20:36.834
I'm going to take the girls
to the beach, OK?

20:36.834 --> 20:39.333
Brian, please.
I want to help you.

20:44.291 --> 20:48.542
Actually, you know, Stephanie
wanted to take them for a while.

20:48.542 --> 20:52.417
Laura, I know you're
so busy with your mid-terms,
so I'll take it from here.

20:52.417 --> 20:54.542
And then you can
go to the library.

20:59.500 --> 21:02.959
- Guess I'll see you later then.
- Yeah.

21:02.959 --> 21:04.333
Go run along.

21:05.959 --> 21:08.625
- Girls, where are you?
- This is all your fault.

21:08.625 --> 21:11.125
My fault? My fault?
What did I do?

21:11.125 --> 21:14.291
I would've called Stephanie,
but you thought it
would be weird.

21:14.291 --> 21:16.959
- What whole thing went down?
- You still here?

21:17.834 --> 21:19.917

21:24.500 --> 21:28.041
OK. OK. OK.

21:30.417 --> 21:34.291
Carrie and I are going
to get some coffee.
We know when we're not wanted.

21:34.291 --> 21:36.542
- Why are people so annoying?
- I hate people.

21:36.542 --> 21:38.792
- I hate cupcakes.
- I hate sprinkles.

21:38.792 --> 21:42.709
- Who the hell are you?
- Bill. I was just trying
to buy a cupcake

21:42.709 --> 21:45.458
- for my daughter. Can I go now?
- No. Keep working.

21:46.917 --> 21:49.709
- Maybe we should just close.
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

21:49.709 --> 21:51.458
Come on. It's just
one day. Come on.

21:51.458 --> 21:54.208
We can't give up.
Failure's not an option.

21:54.208 --> 21:57.333
- You got that Bill?
- Yeah. I got it.

21:58.333 --> 22:00.375
You know something?

22:00.375 --> 22:03.792
You worked much better this
morning when you had
that tiara on your head.

22:05.875 --> 22:07.959
Do you think Laura's mad?

22:07.959 --> 22:12.458
Laura? You should really
be worried about Stephanie.

22:12.458 --> 22:15.417
You basically told her that
she'd make a terrible mother.

22:15.417 --> 22:17.917
- I did not.
- Well, you implied it.

22:17.917 --> 22:21.583
And she's your girlfriend,
not the other one.

22:21.583 --> 22:24.709
Which, by the way,
dating a girl like Stephanie

22:24.709 --> 22:28.166
is the perfect example
of what I was saying before.

22:28.166 --> 22:30.291
You don't really
want to get married.

22:30.291 --> 22:35.083
Because if you did,
you'd be dating someone
who was an actual possibility.

22:35.083 --> 22:39.000
Yeah, and what about you?
When was the last time
you were in a relationship?

22:39.000 --> 22:42.333
Me? No. No, no, no.
I don't do relationships.

22:42.333 --> 22:44.542
Exactly. At least
I'm out there.

22:44.542 --> 22:47.667
- At least I take
risks with people.
- Where are you going?

22:47.667 --> 22:52.333
I'm done working. It's Saturday
and I'm not the one who
lost the file, you did.

22:52.333 --> 22:53.917
So you fix it.

22:53.917 --> 22:57.208
You can just let yourself
out when you're done.

22:57.208 --> 23:02.458
And by the way, Stephanie
would make a great mother.

23:02.458 --> 23:04.959
I thought we were
getting mani/pedis.

23:04.959 --> 23:07.208
We are, honey. I promise.

23:07.208 --> 23:09.333
My agent called
and made me come on this.

23:09.333 --> 23:11.333
Today's the only day
for the audition.

23:11.333 --> 23:13.709
I wanted flower
petals on my toes.

23:13.709 --> 23:15.125
Right after this, we'll go.

23:15.125 --> 23:19.542
You guys just sit here and I'll
be back in one minute, OK?

23:23.125 --> 23:24.583
Looks like you two are next.

23:25.458 --> 23:27.917
Should we get started?

23:27.917 --> 23:30.250
We're waiting for Stephanie.

23:30.250 --> 23:32.291
- Is that your mom?
- No.

23:32.291 --> 23:34.792
- Is Stephanie in casting?
- Yeah.

23:34.792 --> 23:37.166
Well, come with me, then.

23:37.166 --> 23:40.250
You two are cute.
Who wants to be a star?

23:40.250 --> 23:41.500
- Me! I do!
- Me!

23:41.500 --> 23:44.083
Well, it's right in here.
Come on.

23:48.083 --> 23:50.625
[Deena] This road
does not exist, OK?

23:50.625 --> 23:56.333
We are lost in the
middle of nowhere
on an imaginary road, OK?

23:56.333 --> 23:58.208
- [screaming]
- [Dave] My neck! The map!

24:02.083 --> 24:04.375
[Dave] the car overheated?
Car's overheated.

24:05.083 --> 24:06.083
[horn blowing]

24:10.959 --> 24:13.083
God, this can't be
happening right now.

24:14.750 --> 24:17.417
- It's going to be OK.
- It's not going to be OK.

24:17.417 --> 24:21.208
We were supposed to be
in Carmel last night staying
at The Highlands Inn.

24:21.208 --> 24:24.000
We're supposed to wake up late
and have breakfast in bed.

24:24.000 --> 24:27.875
We're supposed to drink
champagne all afternoon
and get ready for our wedding.

24:27.875 --> 24:32.709
And now everything is just...
it's just screwed!

24:32.709 --> 24:37.166
We are going to miss our own
wedding ceremony. It's at six.

24:37.166 --> 24:42.375
- Honey, it's OK.
- No, it's not OK.

24:42.375 --> 24:46.667
It doesn't really matter.
I mean, we're just
going to renew our vows.

24:46.667 --> 24:52.208
- It doesn't matter
when we get there.
- It does matter. It matters.

24:52.208 --> 24:55.959
It matters because
the Druidic priestess is
going to meet us there at six.

24:55.959 --> 24:57.500
Mona?

24:57.500 --> 25:00.500
Yes, Mona. The priestess
from our first wedding.

25:00.500 --> 25:02.792
I found her,
she's coming at six.

25:02.792 --> 25:06.333
That's the most romantic
thing I've ever heard.

25:12.375 --> 25:13.583
[gasps]

25:18.583 --> 25:20.166
My wedding dress?

25:22.750 --> 25:24.542
So it does matter, Deen.

25:24.542 --> 25:27.542
I planned this whole
thing to be the best
weekend of our lives and...

25:29.917 --> 25:34.500
I planned it so we could
go back in time and find
those people we used to be.

25:36.667 --> 25:38.709
You know those people, Deen?

25:38.709 --> 25:42.375
The crazy kids
who were so young and...

25:42.375 --> 25:47.542
...stupid and in love
like you read about.

25:50.500 --> 25:55.041
I want those people back,
Deen. I want us back.

26:01.959 --> 26:03.417
Come on.

26:57.417 --> 26:58.959
Mom, can we just
get an ice cream?

26:58.959 --> 27:01.375
No. We've waited
in line this long,

27:01.375 --> 27:05.959
we're going to get a cupcake
and you're going to like it.

27:05.959 --> 27:07.375
OK.

27:07.375 --> 27:09.458
- Hey, no cuts, bozo.
- There's a line here.

27:09.458 --> 27:12.333
- To the back, pal.
- Right, relax.
I'm just looking.

27:12.333 --> 27:16.375
Excuse me. Excuse me. Watch it.
I have a baby here.

27:16.375 --> 27:18.667
Watch out. Sorry. Excuse me.

to go to the game?

27:21.792 --> 27:23.041
Can't. All right?

27:23.041 --> 27:24.458
Ivy Day has turned
into Ivy Night.

27:24.458 --> 27:26.500
This is the
worst Ivy Day ever.

27:26.500 --> 27:31.250
OK. So, hey, Nicole. What's
with all the bald cupcakes?

27:31.250 --> 27:34.291
Well, we had an assembly line,
but there just wasn't time.

27:34.291 --> 27:36.291
And now we got
to make things to order.

27:38.125 --> 27:40.792
I've totally failed Deena.

Hey. Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey.
There is no crying in baking.

wouldn't give up like that.
Now, where's the fighter?

The savvy business woman?
Where's the animal
I know and love?

27:54.750 --> 27:57.917
Is that a reference to
our night in the bedroom?

27:57.917 --> 28:01.625
- Yes, it is.
- You're right.

28:01.625 --> 28:06.166
What am I thinking? I mean,
I ran a major record label.

28:06.166 --> 28:10.667
I stayed up for weeks straight
with the Rolling Stones.
I have a lion's stamina.

28:10.667 --> 28:15.583
I mean, these are cupcakes
we're talking about,
for God's sakes! I can do this.

28:15.583 --> 28:18.417
- Yeah.
- You want to help?

28:18.417 --> 28:22.583
I'll help only if you go to the
Laker game with me afterwards.

28:22.583 --> 28:24.542
Done. It's a date.

28:26.166 --> 28:30.625
Oh, my God,
that was so worth the wait.

[cows moo]

28:33.458 --> 28:35.834
I think they agree.

28:36.750 --> 28:39.041
You know what the best part is?

28:39.041 --> 28:42.208
We get to do it over and over
again for the rest of our lives.

28:44.083 --> 28:49.125
- You're so beautiful.
- And you look fantastic.

28:49.125 --> 28:50.792
My love handles aren't...?

28:50.792 --> 28:54.333
No. Gosh, no. I think you're
leaner than before.

28:54.333 --> 28:55.709
- Yeah?
- Harder.

28:57.917 --> 29:01.750
You know what?
Who cares if we missed the vows?

29:01.750 --> 29:04.041
Who cares if we
missed the hotel?

29:04.041 --> 29:09.041
- Exactly. Who cares?!
- Right? Who the hell cares?!

29:14.500 --> 29:18.750
I love you, Deena Greco!

29:18.750 --> 29:22.166
I love you, Dave Greco!

29:22.166 --> 29:27.709
I love you Dave
and Deena Greco!

29:27.709 --> 29:30.583
- Yes! Ah!
- [laughs]

29:30.583 --> 29:33.583
Seriously?
Where the hell are we?

29:33.583 --> 29:38.625
I think... we are exactly
where we need to be.

29:38.625 --> 29:43.291
Well, I bet you
the car's cooled down.

29:43.291 --> 29:46.583
We could try to get back to
the main road, make the wedding.

29:46.583 --> 29:48.250
God, I love you.

29:54.959 --> 29:56.625
[knocking]

30:00.333 --> 30:01.959
Can I come in?

30:06.917 --> 30:10.542
I wanted to apologize.
I didn't handle things
very well back there.

30:10.542 --> 30:12.625
No. You didn't.

30:12.625 --> 30:17.625
I let Stephanie take the girls
because I thought it would make
her happy but...

30:17.625 --> 30:21.875
...all I could think about
was you sitting here
being sad because of me.

30:21.875 --> 30:23.625
I'm not sad.

30:23.625 --> 30:26.625
You sure? Because you looked
pretty sad before you left.

30:26.625 --> 30:28.458
Either that or you
wanted to kill me.

30:29.291 --> 30:32.792
I don't want to kill you.

30:33.583 --> 30:35.291
I just...

30:35.291 --> 30:37.375
...I like spending time
with those girls.

30:37.375 --> 30:39.875
They're so sweet

30:39.875 --> 30:44.667
and innocent and...
I was like that, you know?

30:54.375 --> 30:57.667
...no idea how it
feels to want something
you can never have.

30:58.875 --> 31:01.917
You're amazing.
You can have anything you want.

31:01.917 --> 31:06.750
It doesn't seem to happen.
I don't know. Maybe it's me.

31:06.750 --> 31:10.458
Maybe I'm too shy or too quiet.

31:12.500 --> 31:14.875
What are you talking about?

31:14.875 --> 31:19.083
What are you talking about?
What is it that you want?
Tell me.

31:19.834 --> 31:22.250
You really have no idea?

31:25.542 --> 31:28.792
Oh, God. I'm sorry.

31:49.709 --> 31:51.500
[phone ringing]

31:51.500 --> 31:53.208
You should get that.

31:54.500 --> 31:56.625
I don't want to.

31:56.625 --> 32:01.166
You have to. You're responsible
for your friend's kids.

32:07.667 --> 32:09.375
Hi, Stephanie.

32:10.750 --> 32:12.750
Calm down. Calm down.
What?

32:16.291 --> 32:18.834
- What?
- Stephanie lost the girls.

32:20.875 --> 32:22.834
Stephanie.

32:22.834 --> 32:26.083
I'm so sorry, Brian. I only
left them for five minutes.

32:26.083 --> 32:28.000
How long have they been missing?

32:28.000 --> 32:29.667
- About 40 minutes.
- Forty?

32:29.667 --> 32:32.000
We have guards posted
around all the fences.

32:32.000 --> 32:33.834
We're checking
cars and ID's.

32:33.834 --> 32:36.583
No one is getting on unless
they're an employee.

32:36.583 --> 32:38.375
Honey, that
was a great audition.

32:38.375 --> 32:41.166
Are there any other descriptions
you could tell me?

32:41.166 --> 32:44.166
Mrs. Conner couldn't remember
what they were wearing.

32:44.166 --> 32:47.041
Geneva was wearing
a gray hoodie sweatshirt,

32:47.041 --> 32:50.083
pink tie-dye shirt,
pink skirt with those Ugg boots,

32:50.083 --> 32:54.792
and Larissa was wearing
a skirt with a pink sweatshirt
with butterflies.

32:54.792 --> 32:57.083
- Butterflies?
- Yeah. Butterflies.

32:58.333 --> 33:01.250
Oh, thank God.

33:03.417 --> 33:05.166
Girls, where did you go?

33:05.166 --> 33:07.625
This lady came out
and gave us some lines to read.

33:07.625 --> 33:09.625
And we got juice boxes.

33:09.625 --> 33:12.041
- I'm so glad that you're safe.
- How did you...?

33:12.041 --> 33:14.625
I saw some kids
coming out of an audition.

33:14.625 --> 33:17.792
What's a callback? Because I
have one tomorrow at five.

33:17.792 --> 33:20.333
I should never have
brought them here.

33:20.333 --> 33:24.500
How am I going to be a good
mother if I can't even
take care of these guys?

33:24.500 --> 33:26.041

33:26.041 --> 33:28.375
Hey, Steph, come on.
Come on. Come on.

33:28.375 --> 33:32.458
Even parents sometimes
make mistakes, you know?
Kids can get away from you.

33:32.458 --> 33:36.500
I just... Look, if you
had an audition, I just
wished you'd called me.

33:36.500 --> 33:39.083
I know. I know...

33:39.083 --> 33:42.000
It's over now. All right?
They're safe.

33:42.000 --> 33:45.375
Hey, what do you say we go out
and get some pizza or something?

33:45.375 --> 33:47.375
- How does that sound?
- Yeah! Yeah!

33:47.375 --> 33:49.875
- I want pizza.
- Me too. What do you guys want?

33:49.875 --> 33:51.750
- Cheese.
- Pepperoni.

33:51.750 --> 33:52.792
Pepperoni?

33:57.083 --> 33:58.834
Laura, where you going?

34:02.041 --> 34:05.041
You go. With your girlfriend.

34:06.750 --> 34:11.959
I don't want to be this person,
Brian. I don't want
to play games.

34:11.959 --> 34:14.208
Stephanie's my friend.

34:14.208 --> 34:19.667
And I want you to... I want
you to go with her. Please.

34:30.875 --> 34:32.834
Hey. What are you guys doing?

34:32.834 --> 34:35.250
This is where we got
married 15 years ago.

34:35.250 --> 34:36.417
Cool.

34:37.625 --> 34:38.667
Mona?

34:40.041 --> 34:41.417
- Dave!
- Wow!

34:41.417 --> 34:43.041
Deena!

34:43.041 --> 34:46.291
- It's great to see you.
- Look at you!

34:46.291 --> 34:47.750
Wow, you look different.

34:47.750 --> 34:50.750
Well, you know,
I'm not really a Druid anymore.

34:50.750 --> 34:52.792
My husband works
in Silicon Valley and

34:52.792 --> 34:55.375
he wanted us to
raise our kids Episcopalian.

34:55.375 --> 34:58.458
Jason. This is my son, Jason.

34:58.458 --> 35:00.417
- Hey. Jason.
- Hi.

35:00.417 --> 35:03.250
So, you two want
to renew your vows.

35:03.250 --> 35:05.667
- Yeah.
- Yes, we want to.

35:05.667 --> 35:09.917
That is so great.
Most couples these days just
seem to want to break up.

35:09.917 --> 35:14.041
We did for a while, then
realized it was a mistake
and that's why we're here.

35:14.041 --> 35:17.792
That's great. Well, see,
now that was then
and this is now.

35:17.792 --> 35:22.208
So, uh, here
is to new beginnings.

35:22.208 --> 35:24.125
Now, do you have
the candles, honey?

35:24.125 --> 35:26.083
All right.
Oh, I don't... Do you...

35:26.083 --> 35:30.875
Hey, do you have a light
by any chance? I got
to light the candles.

35:30.875 --> 35:31.959
Here you go.

35:33.250 --> 35:36.208
In this wind... look, we'll just
pretend they're lit.

35:36.208 --> 35:38.083
- It's fine.
- You ready?

35:38.083 --> 35:39.625
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

35:43.458 --> 35:49.417
Mother Earth, we are here today
to ask your blessings
for Dave and Deena,

35:49.417 --> 35:52.250
two of your children
who in the hubbub of life

35:52.250 --> 35:56.041
have lost their most valued
possession: each other.

35:56.041 --> 36:00.542
Fifteen years ago, we stood
at this same sacred spot

36:00.542 --> 36:05.375
and they were surrounded
by their family and
most beloved friends.

36:05.375 --> 36:08.125
Today, they come to you anew
to ask as a couple...

36:08.125 --> 36:11.333
Mona, can we... I'm sorry.
Can we just get a second?

36:11.333 --> 36:13.500
Oh. Sure. Sure, yeah.

36:13.500 --> 36:16.667
- Does this feel right to you?
- No. No, not at all.

36:16.667 --> 36:20.709
I mean, the quest thing to get
back to who we were is great
but just not...

36:20.709 --> 36:24.041
It's not who we are anymore.
I mean, we're Dave and Deena,

36:24.041 --> 36:29.834
but we're also Geneva and
Larissa and Carrie and Nic
and Adam and Brian.

36:29.834 --> 36:31.750
I don't want to do it
without them.

36:31.750 --> 36:34.750
- Neither do I.
- God, I love you.

36:34.750 --> 36:36.250
- OK.
- Let's go.

36:42.667 --> 36:46.250
Here we are. Sweet home.

36:46.250 --> 36:50.959
That was fun. One of the best
dates I've had in a long time.

36:50.959 --> 36:54.625
- Is anyone home?
- It doesn't look like it.

36:55.667 --> 37:00.375
Hello? Hello?
Is anyone home?

37:00.375 --> 37:05.208
Oh. Hey. I, uh,
actually just...

37:05.208 --> 37:10.208
...forgot my power cord
on my laptop.

37:10.208 --> 37:13.959
So, how was the game?
You found a date.

37:13.959 --> 37:16.458
- Yeah, we had a great time too.
- Yeah.

37:16.458 --> 37:18.542
Carrie was a little bored.

37:18.542 --> 37:22.041
Well, I'm going to put her down.
All right.

37:22.041 --> 37:24.083
I'm going to go.

37:24.083 --> 37:26.959
I know what's going on
between you and Adam.

37:26.959 --> 37:31.083
- So don't hurt him. OK?
- Excuse me?

37:31.083 --> 37:34.917
He's my friend.
I'm just saying, be careful.

37:34.917 --> 37:39.750
Friend? Are you sure that's all?

37:39.750 --> 37:44.375
Because I actually know about
you two. About what happened.

37:44.375 --> 37:49.458
- So?
- So...maybe you want to
be more than friends.

37:49.458 --> 37:52.917
Adam and I are not
going to get together.

37:52.917 --> 37:55.500
I'm not right for him.

37:55.500 --> 37:57.125
But I don't
think you are either.

37:57.125 --> 38:00.917
- [Brian] Who wants pizza?
- Me, please.

38:00.917 --> 38:03.750
Yeah?
Hey, you're still here.

38:03.750 --> 38:06.417
I just forgot my power cord.

38:06.417 --> 38:08.917
Jimmy and Ivy
are on their way over.

38:08.917 --> 38:12.291
I promised them we'd all hang
out and have a lot to drink.

38:12.291 --> 38:15.208
You want to stay?
Pizza, beer and cupcakes.

38:15.208 --> 38:19.000
- Yeah, you should stay.
- Yeah. Sure.

38:19.000 --> 38:22.542
All right. Great. Well, I'll...
I'll go get the drinks.

38:22.542 --> 38:24.542
[Brian] Who wants
the one that's puffy?

38:27.792 --> 38:29.125
Hey.

38:29.667 --> 38:31.875
Hey.

38:31.875 --> 38:37.458
So, I was thinking
on this arrangement.

38:37.458 --> 38:40.542
Maybe... maybe we should
amend the rules a bit.

38:40.542 --> 38:42.000
Hm. I'm listening.

38:42.000 --> 38:46.959
Um, well, from here on out,

38:46.959 --> 38:49.208
we have sex
with just each other.

38:49.208 --> 38:53.792
We're still not dating
or in a relationship.
But it's exclusive.

38:55.667 --> 39:00.667
Well, I'll agree to your
amendment on one condition.

39:00.667 --> 39:05.500
That you admit
that you were jealous.

39:08.542 --> 39:13.291
OK, I'll admit that I
was jealous. A little.

39:13.291 --> 39:15.500
Does that make you happy?

39:15.500 --> 39:18.917
Ecstatic. Come on, hot stuff.
Let's go.

39:20.667 --> 39:22.750
[laughing]

39:22.750 --> 39:25.959
- I never want
to see frosting again.
- Frosting is disgusting.

39:25.959 --> 39:28.542
I never want to go
on another audition again.

39:28.542 --> 39:32.000
- Me neither.
- I never want to work
on a Saturday.

39:32.000 --> 39:34.834
Yeah, well, let's just be glad
that the day is over.

39:34.834 --> 39:36.291
For real.

39:37.083 --> 39:38.625
Mommy! Daddy!

39:40.417 --> 39:43.375
- What are you doing here?
- What are you guys doing here?

39:43.375 --> 39:46.083
Is your grandma OK?
She feel better?

39:46.083 --> 39:48.208
No, no. Grandma's fine.

39:48.208 --> 39:51.959
Wait, I thought you two
weren't going away together.
What's going on?

39:51.959 --> 39:54.875
It's actually kind of perfect
that you guys are here.

39:54.875 --> 39:58.041
Um, we got a little bit of news.

39:58.041 --> 39:59.500
Mona?

40:00.375 --> 40:02.041
- Hi.
- Hi.

40:02.041 --> 40:06.041
- Everybody, this is Mona.
- You look familiar, Mona.

40:06.041 --> 40:09.750
Mona... Mona...
Mona married us 15 years ago.

40:09.750 --> 40:12.291
- Yep.
- What?

40:12.291 --> 40:16.208
And she's here today so
that we can renew our vows.

40:16.208 --> 40:18.417
We're going
to get married again.

40:18.417 --> 40:21.583
- This is incredible!
- Yeah!

40:21.583 --> 40:25.083
We were just hoping that,
you know, you guys would
want to be our...

40:25.083 --> 40:28.083
- ...our witnesses.
- Absolutely! That's wonderful!

40:29.625 --> 40:32.875
- I love Ivy Day.
- I love Ivy Day too. Come here.

40:34.834 --> 40:37.917
[rock ballad plays]

40:37.917 --> 40:43.417
We are here tonight
to celebrate the union and
re-union of Dave and Deena.

40:45.166 --> 40:50.125
It hasn't always been easy,
but then nothing worth having
ever is.

40:50.125 --> 40:54.250
True love is like a twisted,
old vine.

40:54.250 --> 40:58.500
Over time, the two separate
strands become so intertwined,

40:58.500 --> 41:03.208
it's impossible to tell
where one starts
and the other one ends.

41:03.208 --> 41:06.166
And from this vine comes life.

41:06.166 --> 41:08.667
New flowers. New beginnings.

41:08.667 --> 41:12.375
And, yes, new challenges.

41:12.375 --> 41:17.166
But with the proper care,
this vine continues growing

41:17.166 --> 41:19.750
and turning and climbing.

41:19.750 --> 41:22.667
Always strengthened
by the fact that

41:22.667 --> 41:26.959
this love is stronger
because the two strands

41:26.959 --> 41:30.041
are now one strong vine.

41:30.041 --> 41:32.500
So I ask you here tonight,
Dave and Deena,

41:32.500 --> 41:34.709
in front of friends
that you love the best.

41:34.709 --> 41:40.667
Are you ready to commit
yourselves once again to love,

41:40.667 --> 41:43.917
passionately and completely,

41:43.917 --> 41:46.291
for the rest of your days?

41:46.291 --> 41:48.500
- I do.
- I do.

41:48.500 --> 41:49.834
[Mona] Can I get an amen?

41:49.834 --> 41:52.417
- [all] Amen!
- Amen!

41:52.417 --> 41:54.834
- [Adam] It's about time.
- [Brian] Come on.
