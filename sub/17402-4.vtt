00:18.323 --> 00:20.883
Hello, everybody.
Hello and welcome.

00:21.883 --> 00:25.603
Thank you, everybody, thank you
so much. Thank you, thank you.

00:25.603 --> 00:32.162
Now, Mercedes, a little while ago
they started making AMG

00:32.162 --> 00:36.123
performance versions of standard
cars, and then they started

00:36.123 --> 00:40.563
making performance versions
of the performance versions.

00:40.563 --> 00:43.003
These were called the Blacks,

00:43.003 --> 00:46.323
and the latest car to get
the treatment is this one.

00:46.323 --> 00:48.203
The SLS.

00:52.003 --> 00:55.683
I have driven the SLS many times
and I have never once thought,

00:55.683 --> 00:58.883
"You know what? They should give
this thing more power."

01:00.363 --> 01:03.443
But that's exactly
what they've done.

01:11.403 --> 01:15.523
The standard car produces
583 horsepowers.

01:15.523 --> 01:18.523
This produces 622.

01:20.243 --> 01:25.523
And in engineering circles,
622 horsepower is known as a lot.

01:28.083 --> 01:31.443
It's about that much, and it's
got hairs growing out of it.

01:33.203 --> 01:37.643
It's not just more powerful,
it's also 70 kilograms lighter,

01:37.643 --> 01:41.723
thanks to a carbon-fibre bonnet
and a titanium exhaust system.

01:44.323 --> 01:47.843
So now, 0 to 60 takes 3.6 seconds.

01:47.843 --> 01:53.843
And the top speed is as near as
makes no difference 200mph.

01:56.683 --> 02:00.203
To harness all this firepower,
the SLS Black is fitted with

02:00.203 --> 02:04.323
a big rear wing
and an electronic differential.

02:09.523 --> 02:13.723
The upshot is that you can go into
a corner fairly confident that

02:13.723 --> 02:16.923
you won't come out on
the other side or backwards.

02:18.643 --> 02:22.723
And that changes
the character of the SLS completely.

02:28.483 --> 02:31.523
The standard car
is just a huge laugh.

02:31.523 --> 02:33.403
It scampers about wagging its tail

02:33.403 --> 02:35.603
every time you go near
the accelerator.

02:35.603 --> 02:40.203
You just know it was built
to make a lap fun.

02:40.203 --> 02:43.283
This, though,
this was built to make a lap fast.

02:45.403 --> 02:50.403
And then when you start cornering,
it's so much more focused

02:50.403 --> 02:55.283
and direct. This is a serious car.

02:56.243 --> 02:59.443
I bet it doesn't know a single joke,
not one.

03:02.243 --> 03:05.683
Of course, if you turn
the traction control off

03:05.683 --> 03:08.723
and stamp on the throttle,
you can get it to misbehave.

03:14.963 --> 03:18.363
But you sense immediately
that it doesn't want to do this.

03:21.723 --> 03:23.243
It doesn't like that.

03:23.243 --> 03:26.483
"I am a serious
racing car, English sir!

03:26.483 --> 03:30.043
"Don't drive with
your clown shoes on!"

03:31.683 --> 03:36.003
Happily, even though it is a serious
racing car, Mercedes hasn't felt

03:36.003 --> 03:40.363
compelled to make the interior
as bleak as a Swedish police drama.

03:41.763 --> 03:47.243
You still get sat-nav and air-con
and many buttons that do...things.

03:51.403 --> 03:55.523
So, it's luxurious and fast
and very, very good,

03:55.523 --> 04:00.723
but today, it is
rather overshadowed by this.

04:05.883 --> 04:09.203
Partly, that's because this is
the first car ever to come

04:09.203 --> 04:11.523
with its own high-visibility jacket,

04:11.523 --> 04:17.603
and partly it's because it
produces 739 horsepowers.

04:19.163 --> 04:21.163
Want to hear what that sounds like?

04:21.163 --> 04:24.963
Well, turn up the volume on your TV
and listen to this.

04:26.000 --> 04:32.074
Advertise your product or brand here

04:34.403 --> 04:38.323
Welcome, everyone, to the world's
first electric supercar.

04:40.683 --> 04:43.803
I am astounded.

04:47.163 --> 04:51.643
It is as quiet as a library
for church mice.

04:53.763 --> 04:57.523
It's so quiet, in fact, they fitted
a device in the audio settings

04:57.523 --> 05:00.723
that generates a bit of noise
to keep you awake.

05:00.723 --> 05:02.403
Let's just turn that on.

05:08.523 --> 05:10.803
It doesn't really work.
It's just a hum.

05:12.363 --> 05:14.403
Still,
it isn't the end of the world,

05:14.403 --> 05:17.603
because there is another
way of staying awake in this car.

05:17.603 --> 05:22.443
You put it in sport-plus mode
and put your foot down.

05:27.003 --> 05:30.123
Holy moly! That is 100mph.

05:31.403 --> 05:32.563
120.

05:32.563 --> 05:34.043
130.

05:36.643 --> 05:38.083
140.

05:41.163 --> 05:43.683
This is mind-boggling! And listen.

05:47.443 --> 05:51.643
To find out just how fast it is,
I lined it up for a drag race

05:51.643 --> 05:53.643
against its petrol-powered twin.

05:58.563 --> 06:02.003
I have 117 more horsepowers
than he does,

06:02.003 --> 06:05.363
but I still can't believe I'll win,
because under here,

06:05.363 --> 06:08.683
there are 864 batteries,

06:08.683 --> 06:11.043
so this is half a tonne heavier.

06:11.043 --> 06:15.483
And it's electric,
like a food blender, or torch.

06:16.843 --> 06:21.563
And how can a glorified torch
possibly beat a 6.2 litre V8?

06:24.123 --> 06:27.163
Three, two, one.

06:29.963 --> 06:31.483
It's not a torch!

06:35.923 --> 06:37.683
It is a rampant rabbit!

06:40.123 --> 06:43.923
What in the name of God
is powering this thing?

06:47.403 --> 06:50.323
Well, this is what
an electric SLS looks like

06:50.323 --> 06:55.123
if you take its high-visibility
jacket off. And this is the key.

06:55.123 --> 06:58.443
That is the electric motor.
It's the size of a melon.

06:58.443 --> 07:02.163
It has one moving part
and it produces all of its torques,

07:02.163 --> 07:05.723
and there are many,
the instant you touch the throttle.

07:05.723 --> 07:09.243
Now, all electric cars,
the G-Wiz, the Nissan Leaf, the lot,

07:09.243 --> 07:12.963
have one of these,
but the SLS has four.

07:14.003 --> 07:17.283
There's one for each wheel,
so it's four-wheel-drive,

07:17.283 --> 07:20.883
and it has Formula One-style
pushrod suspension

07:20.883 --> 07:22.523
and a low centre of gravity,

07:22.523 --> 07:26.243
because all the batteries are
mounted in the spine of the chassis.

07:26.243 --> 07:28.363
So theoretically,

07:28.363 --> 07:33.083
this should have the handling
to match the immense grunt.

07:35.843 --> 07:38.683
In comfort mode,
it feels like any other car, really,

07:38.683 --> 07:40.403
but when you put it in sport mode,

07:40.403 --> 07:44.323
all sorts of electronic witchcraft
starts to happen.

07:50.123 --> 07:54.003
In a corner, the motor's powering
the inside wheels,

07:54.003 --> 07:56.123
and I can feel this happening.

07:56.123 --> 07:59.403
They use the sort of brakes
to keep the line tight.

07:59.403 --> 08:02.403
I can feel the car being pulled in.

08:05.883 --> 08:09.163
Then you have a system that
pumps juice into the batteries

08:09.163 --> 08:12.603
every time you slow down, so it
feels like you have engine braking.

08:16.043 --> 08:17.403
Even though you don't.

08:17.403 --> 08:20.803
And then there's a computer that
decides which wheel should

08:20.803 --> 08:26.163
have what amount of power at any
given moment. And the upshot is...

08:27.203 --> 08:31.603
..this doesn't feel like anything
I've ever driven before.

08:31.603 --> 08:35.602
It feels twitchy and nervous.
It feels like a thoroughbred.

08:44.683 --> 08:47.003
It feels brilliant.

08:53.923 --> 08:55.843
So, let's sum up, then.

08:55.843 --> 08:59.203
Instant torque, savage power,
mesmerising speed.

09:00.643 --> 09:06.923
Mercedes quality, no noise
and a petrol bill of exactly nought.

09:06.923 --> 09:11.603
It sounds, then, like the stuff
of dreams, but there are drawbacks.

09:11.603 --> 09:12.883
Range, for example.

09:12.883 --> 09:16.403
If you wanted to drive this car
from London to Manchester,

09:16.403 --> 09:21.203
you'd have to stop in Stoke-on-Trent
and spend 20 hours charging it up.

09:24.923 --> 09:28.563
Mercedes themselves say that at
full chat it wouldn't be able to

09:28.563 --> 09:32.443
do two laps of the Nurburgring.
And they may have a point.

09:32.443 --> 09:34.963
I've only been out here for
seven minutes on this run,

09:34.963 --> 09:38.443
and I've used 44% of the juice.

09:38.443 --> 09:40.083
And there's more.

09:40.083 --> 09:46.483
The electric SLS is £360,000,
and for that,

09:46.483 --> 09:51.483
you could have an SLS Black
and 20,000 gallons of petrol,

09:51.483 --> 09:56.523
which is enough to take it
from here to the moon.

09:56.523 --> 10:01.243
As a result, you'd have to be soft
in the head to buy the yellow car

10:01.243 --> 10:03.403
rather than the V8.

10:03.403 --> 10:06.723
But when there's no choice,
when the oil has run out,

10:06.723 --> 10:12.443
this car does at least show us that
the speed machines will live on.

10:16.763 --> 10:20.763
Very good. But hang on. What?

10:20.763 --> 10:23.003
Are you saying that you drove
an electric car

10:23.003 --> 10:25.683
all the way around our track
and it didn't break down?

10:25.683 --> 10:28.203
Of course not. End of the day,
big red light on the dash,

10:28.203 --> 10:29.963
and that was the end.
But it's working now?

10:29.963 --> 10:31.843
It's working now.
That's interesting,

10:31.843 --> 10:34.643
because I think I'm right in saying
this is the first time we've

10:34.643 --> 10:39.123
ever had the petrol and the electric
version of the same car together.

10:39.123 --> 10:43.003
And I'm genuinely interested to see
which is fastest round our track.

10:43.003 --> 10:44.363
So am I.

10:44.363 --> 10:46.563
And to find out, we must, of course,

10:46.563 --> 10:49.803
hand them over to our
tame racing driver.

10:49.803 --> 10:53.403
Some say that he also has
a button that makes him hum...

10:55.563 --> 10:58.963
..and that if he played football for
Manchester United, he'd be loyal,

10:58.963 --> 11:02.723
because he's not
a potato-headed oaf.

11:02.723 --> 11:05.083
What he is, is the Stig!

11:07.403 --> 11:10.043
And they're off! The electric car
gets off the line faster,

11:10.043 --> 11:14.203
but the V8 has the higher top speed,
so coming up now to the first

11:14.203 --> 11:17.763
corner, the electric car using
computers to control its power,

11:17.763 --> 11:20.923
the Black relying on the Stig's
right paw.

11:24.443 --> 11:29.283
OK, Chicago, often Black Mercs have
too much torque, which makes them

11:29.283 --> 11:32.763
a bit of a handful, but this one
has less than the standard car.

11:32.763 --> 11:36.923
Let's have a look how it deals
with Hammerhead, very good.

11:36.923 --> 11:38.523
And it still sounds good.

11:40.283 --> 11:43.083
Better than the electric car,
that's for sure.

11:44.723 --> 11:46.923
Stig not listening to music
in there,

11:46.923 --> 11:48.963
because he's trying to save juice.

11:48.963 --> 11:50.963
Follow-through now,
a chance to open them up,

11:50.963 --> 11:53.043
and that's properly fast
past the tyres.

11:54.643 --> 11:56.043
Two corners left.

11:56.043 --> 11:59.323
Hard on the brakes, the petrol
getting a bit frisky there,

11:59.323 --> 12:03.003
just Gambon left, piling in hard,
black smoke on its tyres,

12:03.003 --> 12:04.403
and across the line!

12:05.603 --> 12:07.003
And so...

12:11.083 --> 12:15.923
..the electric car, 1.21.7,

12:15.923 --> 12:18.083
which puts it... That's amazing,

12:18.083 --> 12:22.203
look at that, the same speed as
a V10 R8, which is pretty quick.

12:22.203 --> 12:27.003
The dinosaur. 1.19.0. There it is!

12:31.363 --> 12:34.683
I wasn't panicking! I wasn't!

12:36.203 --> 12:40.603
It's a relief.
Right, we must move on,

12:40.603 --> 12:43.523
because it is now time
to do the news.

12:43.523 --> 12:47.563
Yes, and we begin
with the Government's attitude
to speed limits.

12:47.563 --> 12:49.123
You did that last week.

12:49.123 --> 12:51.883
I did it last week and the week
before and the week before that,

12:51.883 --> 12:54.843
and every single week,
the producers have edited it out.

12:54.843 --> 12:59.363
Yeah, they have.
But this week I have a cunning plan
to make sure it stays in.

12:59.363 --> 13:01.003
Do you? Yes, I do, bear with me.

13:01.003 --> 13:04.083
You know earlier on this year
the Government said they

13:04.083 --> 13:08.323
were thinking of upping the motorway
speed limit to 80mph, yes?

13:08.323 --> 13:10.643
Well, the new Transport Minister,
Patrick McLoughlin,

13:10.643 --> 13:14.563
recently announced
that's not going to happen.

13:16.003 --> 13:18.043
Which is a blessed relief.
What?! Why?

13:18.043 --> 13:23.043
Because, if you think about it, if
he'd upped the speed limit to 80,

13:23.043 --> 13:26.003
to keep the Daily Mail happy
and all the road safety charities,

13:26.003 --> 13:29.203
he would have had to say, "Right,
we're having more police patrols,

13:29.203 --> 13:32.843
"more speed cameras, more drones
with more Hellfire missiles,"

13:32.843 --> 13:35.643
to make sure people stick to 80,

13:35.643 --> 13:40.163
which is 15mph slower than we all
drive now.

13:41.603 --> 13:46.003
You're absolutely right. People
on the motorway drive at 95mph.

13:46.003 --> 13:48.643
And yet, I think
I'm right in saying,

13:48.643 --> 13:52.203
British motorways are the safest
roads in Europe, statistically.

13:52.203 --> 13:56.883
They are indeed. I did an experiment
to prove my 95mph point this morning

13:56.883 --> 14:00.563
and I drove down the motorway here
at exactly 70.

14:00.563 --> 14:04.043
Don't you always drive down
the motorway at exactly 70?

14:04.043 --> 14:07.843
Yes, I do. Yes, I do!

14:07.843 --> 14:11.363
No, I don't. No. I usually drive
slower than that.

14:11.363 --> 14:14.843
Do you? But for my experiment,
I sped up to 70.

14:14.843 --> 14:18.323
OK? I drove for 15 miles at 70.

14:18.323 --> 14:22.363
Guess how many cars overtook me?
I'm guessing quite a few. 103.

14:22.363 --> 14:24.363
That was all of them. Exactly.

14:24.363 --> 14:27.883
So thank you very much,
Mr McLoughlin, for maintaining

14:27.883 --> 14:32.283
the 70mph speed limit, because that
means we can all carry on doing 95.

14:32.283 --> 14:34.443
And that's the end of the news.
What?! Is it?

14:34.443 --> 14:36.763
Can't edit that out, can they?
Oh, I see what you did!

14:36.763 --> 14:39.203
That's the only thing in it!
It's got to go in.

14:39.203 --> 14:40.403
It's good. Well done.

14:40.403 --> 14:43.923
And now we must move on to
something else they can't edit out,

14:43.923 --> 14:46.923
because, as I'm sure
we're all aware,

14:46.923 --> 14:49.563
Britain has started flooding
quite often these days.

14:49.563 --> 14:50.963
A couple of reasons for this.

14:50.963 --> 14:54.323
One, a lot of people these days
are buying Toyota Priuses,

14:54.323 --> 14:58.203
which is cooling the world down
and that's causing more rain.

14:59.763 --> 15:02.963
And a lot of houses
are being built on flood plains,

15:02.963 --> 15:05.203
so there's nowhere
for the water to go.

15:05.203 --> 15:06.803
Yes, and because of this, we are

15:06.803 --> 15:09.763
forever seeing pictures of towns
that have been flooded.

15:09.763 --> 15:12.763
Tewksbury, Haywards Heath,
Doncaster, they've all been hit,

15:12.763 --> 15:14.643
and whenever we look
at these pictures,

15:14.643 --> 15:17.963
you can always see
lots of marooned cars.

15:17.963 --> 15:19.483
And this got us thinking.

15:19.483 --> 15:23.963
Is there some simple way that
cars can be kept mobile

15:23.963 --> 15:27.763
even when the street
is under three feet of water?

15:27.763 --> 15:30.763
Now, obviously, you can't simply fit
an outboard motor to the back,

15:30.763 --> 15:33.683
like we did with our cross-channel
Nissan pick-up truck,

15:33.683 --> 15:37.003
because the propeller would snag
submerged obstacles around towns,

15:37.003 --> 15:41.563
and you can't really use oars,
because that would be exhausting.

15:41.563 --> 15:46.283
It all looked hopeless,
but then I had an idea.

15:57.283 --> 16:01.243
I think this is the ideal transport
for a flooded town

16:01.243 --> 16:05.843
such as Doncaster or Tewkesbury,
because a hovercraft simply

16:05.843 --> 16:12.603
glides over road signs, railings,
cows, just about everything, really.

16:17.163 --> 16:21.083
Gentlemen, I give you...the future.

16:21.083 --> 16:24.403
Is it?! Are you suggesting that

16:24.403 --> 16:27.123
if you live in a town
that might flood... Yeah.

16:27.123 --> 16:30.203
..you go everywhere on a hovercraft
in preparation for that day

16:30.203 --> 16:32.003
when it does flood, if it does? No.

16:32.003 --> 16:34.963
OK, you have a hovercraft for when
it floods, but I'm saying

16:34.963 --> 16:38.803
we put wheels on the bottom of this
and then it's a normal car!

16:38.803 --> 16:41.843
No, it isn't! It's a hovercraft
with wheels on the bottom.

16:41.843 --> 16:44.083
Or, this is my other plan,

16:44.083 --> 16:48.363
we get a car and turn it
into a hovercraft, like this.

16:48.363 --> 16:50.963
Oh, for God's sake.
No, he's onto something.

16:50.963 --> 16:55.123
If you think about it, a car
already has an engine and wheels

16:55.123 --> 16:58.483
and space for the passengers
and space for the luggage,

16:58.483 --> 17:03.123
so all you need to do is add to that
another engine to provide the lift.

17:03.123 --> 17:05.762
And another engine to provide
the thrust. There you go.

17:05.762 --> 17:07.403
And some skirts around the bottom.

17:07.403 --> 17:09.443
It's going to have to be quite big,
this car.

17:09.443 --> 17:11.203
There are big cars -
Mercedes S-Class.

17:11.203 --> 17:13.563
Rolls-Royce Phantom, that's massive.
Expensive.

17:13.563 --> 17:16.282
Maserati Quattroporti, you can
pick those up for next to nothing.

17:16.282 --> 17:18.883
You can put three engines in that,
and skirts and everything.

17:20.483 --> 17:23.403
'While Hammond went off
to find a suitable car,

17:23.403 --> 17:27.323
'I spent some time becoming
even more expert at driving
a hovercraft.'

17:27.323 --> 17:29.603
Oh, I wasn't expecting that.

17:30.843 --> 17:35.923
'And James headed off to Top Gear's
secret amphibious engineering centre

17:35.923 --> 17:39.323
'in the Yorkshire town
of Penistone,

17:39.323 --> 17:42.643
'just off St Mary's Street
behind Tesco's.'

17:45.003 --> 17:48.403
While Jeremy hangs around in
the children's playground out there,

17:48.403 --> 17:51.403
I'll go through a few hovercraft
absolute basics for you.

17:51.403 --> 17:53.883
If you imagine looking at it
from the front, you have -

17:53.883 --> 17:55.803
this is very basic - a platform,

17:55.803 --> 17:57.843
wherever you sit
and all the rest of it.

17:57.843 --> 17:59.483
There's a huge fan inside,

17:59.483 --> 18:04.443
which blows air downwards
to form a cushion underneath.

18:04.443 --> 18:07.883
Now, the clever thing is,
this is contained by a flexible

18:07.883 --> 18:10.203
skirt around the edge,

18:10.203 --> 18:12.963
and for this reason it's sort
of self-regulating, because

18:12.963 --> 18:17.203
a certain amount of this cushion
of air escapes out of the sides...

18:20.083 --> 18:22.123
..floating about pointlessly,
so propulsion,

18:22.123 --> 18:23.323
you have generally another...

18:23.323 --> 18:26.723
'Sadly, before James had a chance
to finish his interesting lecture,

18:26.723 --> 18:29.163
'Hammond arrived with his car.'

18:41.323 --> 18:43.363
It's not really a car, is it?

18:43.363 --> 18:47.283
No, it's a Ford transit van,
and it's perfect. Is it?
Let me talk you through it.

18:47.283 --> 18:51.243
What we've got here at the front is
an engine to power the front wheels

18:51.243 --> 18:54.283
and drive it along.
Behind that, seats, room for us.

18:54.283 --> 18:56.203
Behind that, room for our luggage.

18:56.203 --> 18:58.883
Here, room for an engine
to provide lift,

18:58.883 --> 19:02.203
and at the back, room for another
engine to provide thrust.

19:04.083 --> 19:08.043
What?! It's practically a hovercraft
already, I can see it.

19:08.043 --> 19:10.403
It's what we need.

19:10.403 --> 19:13.563
'With the van parked in
the workshop...'

19:13.563 --> 19:14.883
And stop!

19:17.563 --> 19:21.043
'..Richard set to work mounting
the two motorcycle engines

19:21.043 --> 19:23.283
'that would provide lift and thrust.

19:25.043 --> 19:28.323
'I, meanwhile, was making
good progress with the skirts,

19:28.323 --> 19:31.323
'until the expert hover pilot
arrived...'

19:34.043 --> 19:35.883
Sorry! Thank you!

19:37.243 --> 19:39.443
'..and immediately started
to complain

19:39.443 --> 19:41.683
'that we wouldn't have
enough power.'

19:41.683 --> 19:44.803
That is not big enough.
It is. It isn't, it's titchy.

19:44.803 --> 19:47.723
It's a 90 horsepower engine,
and this is doing just the lift.

19:47.723 --> 19:51.483
I've got another 90 horsepower engine
to do the thrust. That's a lot.

19:51.483 --> 19:53.763
Is it? How much power has this got?
35.

19:53.763 --> 19:56.123
And that's got to do both the lift
and the thrust.

19:56.123 --> 19:57.763
I've got two engines, remember.

19:57.763 --> 19:59.843
Look, fire it up, I'll show you
what that can do.

20:01.283 --> 20:02.523
Hold on.

20:11.003 --> 20:12.803
See? So we've got...

20:12.803 --> 20:14.803
We've got many times that.

20:14.803 --> 20:17.203
We've got 35 doing both.
You've got 180.

20:17.203 --> 20:21.323
Yeah, exactly right. The equivalent
of 180 to your 35. That is plenty.

20:21.323 --> 20:25.403
'With the power issues settled,
we went to work.

20:34.643 --> 20:38.203
'Then, out on the proving ground,
I uncovered a problem.'

20:40.083 --> 20:41.403
What are you doing?

20:41.403 --> 20:45.643
Well, it turns out there are some
surfaces where it doesn't work.

20:45.643 --> 20:49.323
I mean, it's all right on the wood
and it's all right on the water.

20:49.323 --> 20:54.883
Think of scale. This is small, these
rocks by comparison are enormous.

20:54.883 --> 20:56.523
If you scale that up...

20:56.523 --> 20:59.563
But if you think about it,

20:59.563 --> 21:03.763
our hovercraft is going to need
to go over, you know, churches...

21:03.763 --> 21:06.203
Not a whole church!

21:07.643 --> 21:10.923
'But despite my concerns,
the work continued.'

21:12.883 --> 21:16.203
My plan is to drive the van normally
from the normal seat over there

21:16.203 --> 21:20.043
and then you switch to
this seat for hover mode.

21:20.043 --> 21:22.403
'Soon the engines were fitted,

21:22.403 --> 21:29.163
'unnecessarily heavy items had been
removed, and our van was ready.'

21:58.843 --> 22:03.683
Gentlemen, Christopher Cockerell,
Barnes Wallis...

22:03.683 --> 22:05.003
Fred Whittle.

22:05.003 --> 22:07.043
You mean Frank. Whatever.

22:07.043 --> 22:10.363
They will all now be shivering
in the cold dark shadow

22:10.363 --> 22:14.003
of our magnificence.
It's utterly, utterly brilliant.

22:14.003 --> 22:17.083
Let me talk you through this thing,
because along the side you'll see

22:17.083 --> 22:20.563
here are the skirts ready
to be deployed when we switch
to hover mode,

22:20.563 --> 22:24.363
then at the back, if we look in here,
you can see mounted amidships,

22:24.363 --> 22:27.683
that's the second engine -
that's powering the lift.

22:27.683 --> 22:31.043
Here at the back, the third engine -
that's powering the thrust.

22:31.043 --> 22:34.163
The fans, the rudder -
it's actually quite beautiful.

22:38.483 --> 22:40.403
'But would it work?

22:40.403 --> 22:44.243
'Well, to find out, we took it
onto the streets of Penistone.'

22:48.003 --> 22:52.283
What I think is critical
is that for 364 days a year,

22:52.283 --> 22:55.563
this has to just be a car,
does it not? Yeah. Yes.

22:55.563 --> 22:58.803
Just something you would use
for shopping,

22:58.803 --> 23:03.123
taking the children to school,
and it's absolutely perfect at that.

23:03.123 --> 23:05.083
I mean,
we're driving around Penistone...

23:05.083 --> 23:08.883
And there's nothing to tell me
there's anything unusual about this.

23:11.643 --> 23:13.203
What they don't realise is that

23:13.203 --> 23:16.723
when the River Penis
bursts its banks, we're ready

23:16.723 --> 23:18.323
in a way that no-one else is. Yeah.

23:21.883 --> 23:26.923
Hey, what about a name?
We haven't thought of a name. Bob.

23:26.923 --> 23:32.443
Transit Fan. Transit Fan! Yeah.
I like that.

23:32.443 --> 23:35.843
Or we could just call it
the hovervan.

23:35.843 --> 23:38.043
Hovervan sort of says what it does.

23:38.043 --> 23:40.443
It does what it says on the tin,
doesn't it?

23:40.443 --> 23:41.723
Yeah, hovervan!

23:43.163 --> 23:46.643
'Having established that it worked
well on the road,

23:46.643 --> 23:50.843
'we found a nearby reservoir where
we could test it on the water.'

23:54.563 --> 23:56.443
This is ideal. This will do.

23:58.003 --> 24:01.043
'After just 90 minutes,
the skirts were deployed,

24:01.043 --> 24:03.883
'the engine waterproofing system
was in place,

24:03.883 --> 24:08.563
'and the three of us had ticked all
the BBC's health and safety boxes.

24:12.843 --> 24:15.883
It's quite exciting. It is. Now,
I'm switching to the hover seat.

24:15.883 --> 24:17.523
I can't walk.

24:18.883 --> 24:24.363
'As a massive crowd gathered,
we began.'

24:24.363 --> 24:27.923
Richard Hammond... Yes!
Engage hover mode. This is it!

24:27.923 --> 24:31.163
Right, this is the lift engine
going on first. Yes.

24:34.523 --> 24:38.923
Yes! We are rising! We are hovering.

24:38.923 --> 24:42.003
Engage thrust mode! Here we go!

24:44.963 --> 24:47.803
Thrust engine is running. Yes!

24:49.803 --> 24:50.963
Oh!

24:53.523 --> 24:55.723
We're moving. We are moving!

24:55.723 --> 24:57.083
It works!

24:59.803 --> 25:00.843
We're going in.

25:02.483 --> 25:04.363
And now the transition
from land to water!

25:09.083 --> 25:13.363
More lift, Hammond, more lift!
I'm giving it all it's got!

25:13.363 --> 25:16.483
Hammond, more! More!

25:16.483 --> 25:18.843
Hammond, more lift!

25:26.523 --> 25:27.603
Hang on!

25:27.603 --> 25:32.043
Why did that happen!
We've got to save it, save it!

25:32.043 --> 25:34.803
OK, we've got a bit of flooding
back here.

25:34.803 --> 25:38.483
When I say a bit, I mean,
quite a lot. Was that full power?

25:38.483 --> 25:41.563
You didn't give it enough lift!
You idiot!

25:41.563 --> 25:44.523
You went in too quickly.
It swamped.

25:44.523 --> 25:48.643
Right, and with that,
back to the drawing board.

25:55.203 --> 25:59.323
Well, that was
a complete catastrophe

25:59.323 --> 26:02.443
and it was all Hammond's fault.
How was it my fault?

26:02.443 --> 26:06.563
Because, as predicted, those engines
weren't powerful enough.

26:06.563 --> 26:09.323
No, the problem was,
and I never thought I'd say this,

26:09.323 --> 26:11.483
James's skirt was too small.

26:11.483 --> 26:14.763
No, no, I'm not having that, there
was nothing wrong with my skirt.

26:14.763 --> 26:18.523
The problem was that he just charged
into the water, as usual,

26:18.523 --> 26:19.763
like an imbecile.

26:19.763 --> 26:22.803
Well, whatever,
it was a total failure,

26:22.803 --> 26:26.283
but Barnes Wallis didn't give up
in the face of adversity,

26:26.283 --> 26:29.243
and neither did we,
as you shall see later on.

26:29.243 --> 26:33.323
Now, though, it is time to put
a star in our reasonably priced car.

26:33.323 --> 26:36.723
Now, my guest tonight is enormously
famous these days

26:36.723 --> 26:38.923
because of his massive sideburns

26:38.923 --> 26:41.563
and because you wouldn't want
to shake hands with him.

26:41.563 --> 26:43.443
Don't worry,
it's not John McCririck.

26:45.083 --> 26:46.363
It is, in fact, Wolverine.

26:46.363 --> 26:49.163
Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome Hugh Jackman!

26:53.363 --> 26:54.923
How are you?

26:58.523 --> 27:01.563
Have a seat. Thank you.

27:01.563 --> 27:03.003
Hands are fine.

27:07.923 --> 27:12.163
That's a lot of smiling faces today.
Smiley, sweaty faces.

27:12.163 --> 27:15.203
I love it. I feel like I'm
in Australia. Thank you for this.

27:15.203 --> 27:18.803
Actually, on that note, we like
to feel our guests feel at home,

27:18.803 --> 27:21.803
so are you enjoying the Ashes? Yeah!

27:24.483 --> 27:27.443
Or would you prefer to talk
about the Lions tour? Yeah.

27:28.643 --> 27:32.243
Or the Olympics, or Andy Murray.
What's going on in this country?!

27:32.243 --> 27:35.123
Since I came here, it's 31,
you're winning every sport,

27:35.123 --> 27:39.003
I'm like, what, this is wrong!
We just had a few years off.

27:39.003 --> 27:41.683
But you know the good thing about
this being such a hot summer,

27:41.683 --> 27:44.603
I've been coming here for many
years, my parents are English,

27:44.603 --> 27:47.883
and since I was 12,
when I first came here,

27:47.883 --> 27:50.403
everyone talks
about the summer of '76.

27:50.403 --> 27:56.523
I'm like, what kind of country
do you live in when everybody
reminisces about the summer of '76?

27:56.523 --> 27:58.883
And finally, that's over.

27:58.883 --> 28:01.483
Trust me, did you miss the first
half of this?

28:01.483 --> 28:04.003
That was BLEEP.

28:05.643 --> 28:08.883
We're going to get onto Wolverine
in a minute, obviously,

28:08.883 --> 28:10.803
the new movie,
but when you were growing up,

28:10.803 --> 28:14.283
from what I can understand, you
actually wanted to be in musicals.

28:14.283 --> 28:17.403
Your recent appearance
in Les Miserables was more where you

28:17.403 --> 28:19.443
wanted to go.
Am I right in saying that?

28:19.443 --> 28:22.003
Yeah. It's weird, I always did...

28:22.003 --> 28:25.323
The musical side of things was
actually more of a surprise for me.

28:25.323 --> 28:28.123
I did a couple of eminent musicals
and I was really bad.

28:28.123 --> 28:30.723
I remember actually doing
West Side Story

28:30.723 --> 28:33.483
for the Eastern Suburbs
Musical Society.

28:33.483 --> 28:35.883
I couldn't sing
any of the top three notes.

28:35.883 --> 28:38.243
I was playing Tony and...

28:38.243 --> 28:41.043
♪ Maria, Maria... ♪
And then it goes really high.

28:41.043 --> 28:43.803
Every night, I can't believe
I did this on stage,

28:43.803 --> 28:46.523
♪ Maria, Maria, Ma... ♪

28:49.083 --> 28:50.443
Looking into the wings...

28:51.883 --> 28:53.403
♪ Maria! ♪

28:55.123 --> 28:56.643
A really clever way.

28:56.643 --> 28:59.483
All my mates came, "That sound
department sucked, man.

28:59.483 --> 29:03.123
"You were awesome, and right at
the key moment, just cut out!"

29:03.123 --> 29:07.483
Obviously, you made a name
for yourself before Wolverine
came along,

29:07.483 --> 29:11.963
but what was it that caused you to
say, "Yeah, I want to move into..."

29:11.963 --> 29:15.043
effectively, the kind of comic book
franchise of X-Men?

29:15.043 --> 29:16.363
It's interesting.

29:16.363 --> 29:19.883
When I got the part of Wolverine,
first of all,

29:19.883 --> 29:21.883
I would have taken it
no matter what it was,

29:21.883 --> 29:24.363
I had no other job at the time,
but I didn't realise how good

29:24.363 --> 29:28.723
a part it was, and in fact,
my wife said, "You can't do this.
This is ridiculous."

29:28.723 --> 29:31.483
I was auditioning, she read
the scene with me and said,

29:31.483 --> 29:36.203
"Wolverine senses danger and claws
come out of his hands. Snikt!"

29:36.203 --> 29:39.843
She said, "This is ridiculous.
You're at the Royal National Theatre
in London,

29:39.843 --> 29:41.723
"and now you're
going to have claws."

29:41.723 --> 29:43.963
She chucked it down and says,
"You're on your own!"

29:43.963 --> 29:46.923
The only time she's ever
been wrong in 18 years.

29:46.923 --> 29:50.483
And she doesn't watch this show,
so I'm all good in saying that.

29:50.483 --> 29:54.803
So, Wolverine, new movie out. Yeah.
Tell us about it.

29:54.803 --> 29:58.323
So the movie takes place, for X-Men
fans, it's straight after X-Men 3,

29:58.323 --> 30:01.523
Wolverine is literally at the bottom
of his life.

30:01.523 --> 30:04.123
He's almost made a vow
not to be Wolverine,

30:04.123 --> 30:07.803
cos everywhere he goes,
the people he loves die,

30:07.803 --> 30:11.163
it's filled with pain and regret,
destruction,

30:11.163 --> 30:14.923
so everything that makes him great
also brings his sadness and loss.

30:14.923 --> 30:17.883
That's where you find him.
He then gets brought to Japan.

30:17.883 --> 30:20.883
This is based on one of the great
comic books ever written,

30:20.883 --> 30:23.363
this Japanese saga,
or the samurai story.

30:23.363 --> 30:28.883
And in he goes, and of course, he
has to look inside himself to find

30:28.883 --> 30:30.963
the inner person
and choose what he wants to be.

30:30.963 --> 30:32.443
Needless to say, we have a clip,

30:32.443 --> 30:34.563
we'd like to show that now
if we may. Fantastic.

30:36.163 --> 30:38.923
My employer wants to thank you
for saving his life.

30:38.923 --> 30:40.243
I wanted to repay you, Logan.

30:41.323 --> 30:42.723
I can end your eternity.

30:43.923 --> 30:44.803
Make you mortal.

30:51.323 --> 30:52.523
I'm not healing like before.

30:56.443 --> 30:58.323
Is that all the men you brought?

30:59.403 --> 31:01.883
Your grandfather called me a ronin -

31:01.883 --> 31:03.443
a samurai without a master...

31:05.003 --> 31:06.363
..who has no reason to live.

31:12.003 --> 31:13.163
Was he right?

31:17.403 --> 31:18.843
There it is.

31:20.043 --> 31:22.403
Saw it the other night.

31:22.557 --> 31:23.957
Thank you.

31:25.797 --> 31:27.837
One of the things I noticed
in the new film is

31:27.837 --> 31:30.517
the hair is a lot less extravagant
than it has been in the past.

31:30.517 --> 31:33.277
Yeah, environmental groups
really had a go at us

31:33.277 --> 31:35.677
for the amount of hairspray
we were using.

31:35.677 --> 31:38.557
That must have been the ozone layer
right there, gone, really.

31:38.557 --> 31:42.357
Completely. So we've quit that,
we've moved on.

31:42.357 --> 31:44.477
So, you were filming
a lot of that in Japan.

31:44.477 --> 31:46.157
Yeah. Isn't that a great country?

31:47.237 --> 31:49.517
I love Japan.
I've been there maybe 11 times.

31:49.517 --> 31:52.757
I love the customs, their attention
to detail, the food...

31:52.757 --> 31:54.477
The cab drivers wear gloves.

31:54.477 --> 31:57.277
Everything is polite
and everything's...

31:57.277 --> 32:00.597
But I did make a few faux pas.
In Japan? Yeah.

32:00.597 --> 32:03.517
The worst one was the onsens.

32:03.517 --> 32:07.037
Did you go to the onsens,
the bathhouses that they have?

32:07.037 --> 32:10.477
I know exactly what you mean.
No, my penis is too small.

32:16.797 --> 32:19.157
Right. You know what I mean?

32:19.157 --> 32:20.277
No!

32:26.877 --> 32:27.997
There we go!

32:33.277 --> 32:36.397
So anyway, for those who haven't
been, they're natural springs,

32:36.397 --> 32:38.157
and they're hot
and they're incredible,

32:38.157 --> 32:39.517
and it's part of the culture.

32:39.517 --> 32:42.597
It's a whole rigmarole, you have
to put everything in the locker,

32:42.597 --> 32:44.717
you have to put on a robe,
you put on slippers,

32:44.717 --> 32:46.117
and then when you go in, nothing.

32:46.117 --> 32:49.357
They give you a little towel,
almost like a flannel sort of thing,

32:49.357 --> 32:50.837
and that's it, you walk in, hot.

32:50.837 --> 32:53.557
Hot as hell, everyone's walking
around, walking around naked,

32:53.557 --> 32:55.477
you're there for about an hour.

32:55.477 --> 32:58.197
And they have one little cold pool
to cool yourself down,

32:58.197 --> 32:59.597
cos everything's super hot.

32:59.597 --> 33:03.117
So, I'm dipping it in the coal pool
and I'm putting it on my head,

33:03.117 --> 33:04.837
to cool myself down.

33:04.837 --> 33:06.037
And I'm sitting like this

33:06.037 --> 33:08.957
and I'm getting the weirdest looks
from all the guys, and I thought,

33:08.957 --> 33:11.197
"This is really weird, I don't know
what's going on."

33:11.197 --> 33:12.357
And then finally, one guy,

33:12.357 --> 33:14.517
he was sitting in the tub like this
and he goes...

33:19.957 --> 33:21.877
I was like, "No, mate,
not my thing."

33:24.197 --> 33:28.037
I went, "Oh, really...? Oh, right!
The flannel was for that, right!"

33:30.317 --> 33:33.637
I'd just been waltzing around,
"Woo, hey!

33:33.637 --> 33:34.997
"How you doing? How you doing?!"

33:37.237 --> 33:40.197
I was avoiding getting on to cars,
cos I'd looked into your history

33:40.197 --> 33:41.837
and it's not... Not as a child,
anyway,

33:41.837 --> 33:43.957
cos you seem to have spent most of
your childhood

33:43.957 --> 33:46.317
being driven around Australia
in the back of a Volvo.

33:46.317 --> 33:47.837
I remember my dad getting a Volvo,

33:47.837 --> 33:51.237
literally because he's an accountant
and he'd heard it's the safest car.

33:51.237 --> 33:54.837
They had those little seats in the
back that would fold up backwards,

33:54.837 --> 33:59.077
and I basically spent my entire
childhood giving the finger

33:59.077 --> 34:01.997
to cars behind me
and almost throwing up,

34:01.997 --> 34:05.117
because it was the week-old cooler
filled with the food,

34:05.117 --> 34:07.837
because my dad was really tight,
so he would pack food for a week

34:07.837 --> 34:10.476
and we'd have it in the back of
the car in temperatures like this,

34:10.476 --> 34:11.996
and I'd have my feet on it,

34:11.996 --> 34:14.917
so I'm smelling like bad liverwurst
and things like that.

34:14.917 --> 34:18.757
Have your kids ever gone through
the car-sickness phase?

34:18.757 --> 34:20.556
My daughter gets it
a little bit, yeah.

34:20.556 --> 34:23.476
I just think, you know when a car
manufacturer quotes the ability

34:23.476 --> 34:25.476
of a car to stop from
100 miles an hour,

34:25.476 --> 34:27.476
100 kilometres an hour,
down to zero?

34:27.476 --> 34:30.717
You can always beat it when a child
goes, "I'm feeling a bit sick."

34:32.317 --> 34:36.357
Because when a child is sick in a
car, the car has to be written off.

34:36.357 --> 34:38.397
Yes, replaced immediately!

34:38.397 --> 34:41.197
There is no chance! Absolutely!

34:41.197 --> 34:43.197
So, obviously, you came here today,

34:43.197 --> 34:45.717
temperatures very similar
to Australia. Right.

34:45.717 --> 34:48.317
I mean, properly hot. There is
a bit of a problem, I think,

34:48.317 --> 34:49.956
with our new reasonably priced car,

34:49.956 --> 34:52.877
because it is much faster with
the air conditioning off. Yeah.

34:52.877 --> 34:54.437
Apparently, you did turn it off.

34:54.437 --> 34:57.277
Yeah.
Because I was hoping for any edge.

34:57.277 --> 34:59.517
My driving ability is so bad. Is it?

34:59.517 --> 35:02.197
My assistant is here,
who I've known for 20 years.

35:02.197 --> 35:05.677
He's a mad fan of this show. He's
pissed off with me that I'm here.

35:05.677 --> 35:07.477
He says, "You don't deserve it.

35:07.477 --> 35:09.717
"I've put in the effort,
I've watched every episode,

35:09.717 --> 35:12.277
"I love this show, and look at you,
you do a couple of movies,

35:12.277 --> 35:15.637
"you pretend to be someone else and
you're driving the car with Stig!"

35:15.637 --> 35:18.557
Anyway, you went out there,
air conditioning off... Yeah.

35:18.557 --> 35:20.877
..for your hot lap. Yeah.
Anyone want to see it?

35:20.877 --> 35:21.957
Yes!

35:21.957 --> 35:23.077
Let's play the tape.

35:28.917 --> 35:31.957
Yeah, I feel the need for speed!

35:31.957 --> 35:34.197
6,000, here we go.

35:34.197 --> 35:36.197
This is looking, actually,
like you're on it,

35:36.197 --> 35:38.597
like you really care about
whether you're going to...

35:38.597 --> 35:40.677
Ooh, I say,
that's good grip through there.

35:40.677 --> 35:45.517
Aggressive turning. I literally look
very low in the car.

35:45.517 --> 35:48.837
It's a low seat. Yes! I didn't think
I was going to feel competitive.

35:48.837 --> 35:50.317
My God, am I feeling competitive!

35:50.317 --> 35:52.597
Brake a little earlier,
remember what Stig said.

35:52.597 --> 35:54.757
I can see, the way you're driving,

35:54.757 --> 35:57.317
that this is a man who
wants that thing to...

35:57.317 --> 35:58.877
Oh-ho-ho! Yeah!

35:58.877 --> 36:01.317
Come on, Jackman!

36:01.317 --> 36:03.237
6,000, that's good.

36:03.237 --> 36:05.877
All right, this is my Achilles heel,
this corner.

36:05.877 --> 36:08.557
Yeah, it's everybody's
Achilles heel.

36:08.557 --> 36:11.637
They mostly go off at
the second to last corner.

36:11.637 --> 36:13.597
Hugh, this is not bad at all.

36:13.597 --> 36:15.437
Isn't it? No.

36:15.437 --> 36:16.957
I'm actually deeply impressed.

36:16.957 --> 36:20.317
You're using more of the track
than Benedict did last week.

36:20.317 --> 36:23.877
OK. Don't be a pussy.

36:23.877 --> 36:25.477
Stay on it. Just stay.

36:25.477 --> 36:27.757
Oh, can't believe
I'm staying on there.

36:27.757 --> 36:30.677
Full accelerator. Yeah, Stig!
You'd be proud of me!

36:32.397 --> 36:35.077
It does take guts to do that.

36:35.077 --> 36:37.637
Keep your foot hard in it.
And close to the tyres?

36:37.637 --> 36:40.117
Whoa, yes! Close to those tyres!

36:40.117 --> 36:41.637
Smell the rubber!

36:41.637 --> 36:44.917
Right, now, let's see if
you clip this nicely...

36:44.917 --> 36:46.877
Yes, that is very good.

36:46.877 --> 36:49.917
Oh! Nearly off there,
but held it nicely.

36:49.917 --> 36:52.317
Gambon, that's nicely done,
as well.

36:52.317 --> 36:53.557
Across the line!

36:53.557 --> 36:55.077
Oh!

37:00.037 --> 37:01.157
So...

37:03.477 --> 37:05.797
I have your time here. Oh, OK.

37:05.797 --> 37:07.517
Where do you think you came?

37:07.517 --> 37:10.117
I'm thinking...

37:10.117 --> 37:11.557
Oh, Charles Dance.

37:11.557 --> 37:14.037
Either just above
or just below Charles.

37:14.037 --> 37:17.157
Just above or just below.
But you're in the 1.48s, you think?

37:17.157 --> 37:18.557
Yeah. Okey-doke.

37:18.557 --> 37:21.117
well, you did it in 1...

37:21.117 --> 37:22.757
40...

37:24.437 --> 37:25.877
..6...

37:25.877 --> 37:26.917
Oooh!

37:26.917 --> 37:29.757
..1. So, you're now
our third fastest! Wow!

37:33.597 --> 37:34.877
Mate!

37:37.037 --> 37:38.317
Where's Irving?

37:38.317 --> 37:39.797
Singing, dancing...

37:39.797 --> 37:40.957
Irving!

37:40.957 --> 37:42.397
Looking for your mate?

37:42.397 --> 37:45.317
Where's Irving? Irving?
Where are you, Irving?

37:45.317 --> 37:47.317
Irving, come out.
He's going to hate this.

37:47.317 --> 37:48.557
He said, "You were crap."

37:49.757 --> 37:52.317
He said, "You're pathetic.
You've embarrassed me."

37:52.317 --> 37:54.357
Irving, where are you?
Come on, mate.

37:54.357 --> 37:55.757
Third. I'm impressed. Yeah!

37:56.957 --> 37:58.557
I'm impressed. Thank you!

37:58.557 --> 38:01.117
We are all impressed.
That's on tape!

38:01.117 --> 38:03.397
It's on tape!

38:03.397 --> 38:05.757
Ladies and gentlemen, Hugh Jackman!

38:05.757 --> 38:07.197
Thank you.

38:16.157 --> 38:19.397
Now, earlier on,
we built a hovervan,

38:19.397 --> 38:20.837
which sank.

38:20.837 --> 38:23.077
Yeah, it worked
perfectly well as a van,

38:23.077 --> 38:25.237
it just didn't really
work as a hovercraft.

38:25.237 --> 38:27.637
But no matter, because
we've had another go,

38:27.637 --> 38:30.597
ladies and gentlemen,
and here it is!

38:34.037 --> 38:36.037
Now, in the back

38:36.037 --> 38:39.317
I have replaced the two 90 horsepower
engines with these.

38:39.317 --> 38:44.157
For the lift, we have the engine
from a Yamaha R1 Superbike.

38:44.157 --> 38:46.357
And for the thrust, a compact,

38:46.357 --> 38:49.757
lightweight 2.4 litre V8
from a Radical track car.

38:49.757 --> 38:53.477
All of which means,
in the back of this van,

38:53.477 --> 38:56.717
there is now 600 horsepower.

38:56.717 --> 38:58.157
Oooh!

38:58.157 --> 39:00.557
Oh, yes. I, meanwhile,
have been fitting

39:00.557 --> 39:02.397
these new, bigger, tougher skirts,

39:02.397 --> 39:07.117
which you just lower
in a jiffy, like so.

39:07.117 --> 39:09.477
And I've also added,
on top of those,

39:09.477 --> 39:13.957
these inflatable rubber tubes,
which make it a bit less sinky.

39:21.637 --> 39:26.037
We're so confident that the
mark II hovervan will work

39:26.037 --> 39:29.117
that we shall be testing
it in our home clothes,

39:29.117 --> 39:30.837
but not on a reservoir.

39:30.837 --> 39:33.437
Instead, we shall be
testing it here

39:33.437 --> 39:36.277
on the mighty Avon.

39:38.157 --> 39:41.117
With overhanging branches,
submerged shopping trolleys

39:41.117 --> 39:42.597
and many obstacles,

39:42.597 --> 39:46.197
the Avon more realistically
represents a flooded street.

39:47.317 --> 39:49.757
If our van works here, it will work

39:49.757 --> 39:52.317
in your town when the torrent comes.

39:53.637 --> 39:56.997
Right, listen. I'm going to drive.

39:56.997 --> 40:00.037
Hammond, you're in charge
of the engine room. Right.

40:00.037 --> 40:01.957
And James, you're the navigator.

40:03.237 --> 40:08.517
'Brimming with confidence,
we initiated the launch procedure.'

40:08.517 --> 40:10.437
Fire up the lift engine!

40:10.437 --> 40:12.437
Aye aye, Clarkson.

40:17.637 --> 40:19.877
Fire up the thrust engine.

40:19.877 --> 40:22.117
I love all the things
we have to say.

40:22.117 --> 40:24.997
I know. Here it comes.
I'll give it a bit of a juice.

40:30.677 --> 40:32.637
You have it. You have thrust.

40:36.837 --> 40:39.797
And we're moving! We are going!
We're going right!

40:39.797 --> 40:42.597
We're going sideways! Go to port!

40:42.597 --> 40:45.277
Here we go! 600 horsepower.

40:45.277 --> 40:47.237
Unleash it! Here we go. Oh, my God!

40:48.957 --> 40:52.357
I'm engaging thrust. It works!

40:52.357 --> 40:54.157
It only flipping works!

40:54.157 --> 40:55.317
We're float... Oh, BLEEP!

40:55.317 --> 40:57.557
I'm drowning! There is quite
a lot of water coming in.

40:57.557 --> 40:59.437
I'm turning it! Windscreen wipers!

40:59.437 --> 41:01.397
Turn it more, we're going
to hit the bank!

41:01.397 --> 41:04.237
Hard to starboard!
Jeremy, turn right!

41:04.237 --> 41:06.517
I don't... You can't do that!

41:06.517 --> 41:08.637
Of course it can! We've crashed!

41:11.037 --> 41:12.877
We're a bit stuck.

41:12.877 --> 41:15.197
This is the sort of practice
you should have been doing

41:15.197 --> 41:17.917
while we were busy fitting engines
and building this thing.

41:17.917 --> 41:21.197
'In my defence, hovercrafts
have no brakes, no reverse,

41:21.197 --> 41:24.197
'extremely haphazard steering and,

41:24.197 --> 41:26.357
'if you cut the lift engine,

41:26.357 --> 41:28.677
'it can't be restarted on water.'

41:28.677 --> 41:30.837
You're heading for
the other bank now?

41:30.837 --> 41:32.597
I'm coming back on the power.

41:32.597 --> 41:34.397
Here comes the bank! No brakes!

41:34.397 --> 41:36.197
Aaaargh! Crash!

41:36.197 --> 41:38.037
Boy, steer that way!

41:39.557 --> 41:41.637
This river's too narrow.

41:41.637 --> 41:43.357
Well, it's river-shaped.

41:43.357 --> 41:45.037
They tend to be long and thin.

41:45.037 --> 41:47.917
Here we go! I'm going to give
it full speed to return.

41:47.917 --> 41:51.317
Too much! Too much!
Oh, things are working. Steer it!

41:51.317 --> 41:54.757
James, I am one of the world's
best hovercraft drivers.

41:54.757 --> 41:57.117
Oh, I can see that. Is that
why we're in a nettle bush?

41:57.117 --> 41:58.637
Oh, yes.

41:58.637 --> 42:01.357
Ah-ha! What do you think of that?

42:03.277 --> 42:04.917
There's a man fishing.

42:04.917 --> 42:08.797
I'm sorry. Sorry. It's all... Sorry.

42:08.797 --> 42:11.757
Tree! Tree! Tree! Tree! Tree! Tree!

42:11.757 --> 42:13.397
Oh, huge tree!

42:14.637 --> 42:15.877
No brakes!

42:15.877 --> 42:18.437
Relax! What are you worried about?

42:18.437 --> 42:21.197
We're in the tree!
The tree's coming in the...

42:21.197 --> 42:22.637
How can that be in the van?

42:23.997 --> 42:25.277
Ow! Crash!

42:28.197 --> 42:29.517
Oh, no, we broke the window!

42:29.517 --> 42:32.157
We've actually broken
the windscreen!

42:32.157 --> 42:35.877
Yes, you have. You've made
a complete horse's arse of that.

42:35.877 --> 42:39.197
We can edit this out.
Nobody needs know this has happened.

42:39.197 --> 42:41.157
Is there a boathook, James? Yes.

42:41.157 --> 42:43.837
Push us off. I'll come over.

42:43.837 --> 42:44.997
You keep an eye on that.

42:44.997 --> 42:46.757
Don't let it go over eight. Eight?

42:46.757 --> 42:48.077
Mind your elbow!

42:48.077 --> 42:50.557
Your elbow nearly killed the lift.

42:50.557 --> 42:51.877
Push!

42:53.357 --> 42:56.357
That's more like it. That's it.

42:56.357 --> 42:58.277
There you go. Go, go, go, go!

42:58.277 --> 43:02.037
Wipers, James! Wipers!

43:02.037 --> 43:03.677
They're broken.

43:03.677 --> 43:05.397
Richard? Yes?

43:05.397 --> 43:07.477
I think I've got the hang
of it now. Brilliant.

43:07.477 --> 43:10.477
Let's go and refuel. Go and what?

43:10.477 --> 43:12.757
We've got to stop for fuel.
We're running out.

43:12.757 --> 43:14.477
We've only been going ten minutes!

43:14.477 --> 43:16.717
Well, yeah, I know.
But we've used it all...

43:16.717 --> 43:19.357
There's 600 horsepower back there!
It needs a lot of fuel.

43:19.357 --> 43:21.357
How big's the tank? Two gallons.

43:21.357 --> 43:23.077
Two? Yeah!

43:24.517 --> 43:28.037
'On that bombshell,
we headed back to the bank.'

43:28.037 --> 43:31.117
Hammond, get ready to kill
those engines and James,

43:31.117 --> 43:33.077
get ready to start up the other one.

43:33.077 --> 43:34.917
Hammond, kill the engines now!

43:34.917 --> 43:36.917
Kill! Killed.

43:36.917 --> 43:39.997
Road engine's not starting. What?

43:39.997 --> 43:41.437
Why is the starter not working?

43:41.437 --> 43:43.757
Because it's wet.
Why didn't you waterproof it?!

43:43.757 --> 43:46.597
I didn't anticipate...
Why are we still shouting?!

43:48.197 --> 43:51.757
'Fortunately, getting it out
of the water was no bother at all.'

43:58.637 --> 44:03.597
'But, as we were refuelling,
we received an unpleasant surprise.'

44:04.917 --> 44:07.357
Hammond? What?

44:07.357 --> 44:10.117
It's the gold envelope. What?

44:10.117 --> 44:12.597
I wasn't expect...

44:12.597 --> 44:16.757
"You will drive your hover van
from here in Stratford-upon-Avon

44:16.757 --> 44:20.437
"to Tewkesbury, one of the most
frequently flooded towns in the UK.

44:20.437 --> 44:23.997
"Once there, you will show off your
invention to the local residents."

44:23.997 --> 44:26.317
How far is that?

44:26.317 --> 44:30.397
Got to be 50 miles. 50?
How far have we just done?

44:30.397 --> 44:33.317
50 yards?
It's a lot of refuelling.

44:33.317 --> 44:35.477
Er...right.

44:38.917 --> 44:40.077
'Having saddled up...'

44:40.077 --> 44:41.997
I feel like Daisy Duke.

44:41.997 --> 44:44.997
'..we set off for Tewkesbury.'

44:44.997 --> 44:46.357
Engaging power.

44:46.357 --> 44:47.837
A full left turn.

44:50.677 --> 44:54.077
Oh, are we good or what?

44:54.077 --> 44:55.397
Excellent work.

44:55.397 --> 44:58.757
Continue as you are,
Captain Clarkson.

44:58.757 --> 45:00.837
Feels good every time!
I love this!

45:00.837 --> 45:02.877
This is a great machine.

45:02.877 --> 45:05.277
Brilliant machine.
I mean, it really is.

45:05.277 --> 45:08.837
'With everything going well,
we settled down for what

45:08.837 --> 45:12.837
'we hoped would be
an uneventful maiden voyage.'

45:22.197 --> 45:25.317
'But, as we arrived
in the tranquil suburbs

45:25.317 --> 45:27.837
'of historical Stratford-upon-Avon,

45:27.837 --> 45:31.597
'we became conscious that there
was an issue with noise.'

45:37.477 --> 45:39.917
'And then, there was the spray.'

45:41.077 --> 45:42.797
Then to the left.

45:42.797 --> 45:47.117
Sorry, everybody! I do apologise!

45:47.117 --> 45:49.637
I'm so sorry! Sorry!

45:50.757 --> 45:52.997
How far have we come so far?

45:52.997 --> 45:57.197
300 yards. Excellent. How long
has it taken? About 20 minutes.

46:03.477 --> 46:06.437
'Eventually, we arrived
in the centre of Stratford,

46:06.437 --> 46:09.037
'and encountered
our first obstacle.'

46:13.077 --> 46:14.717
Now, the bridge...

46:14.717 --> 46:18.197
You need to know that the bridge
is from 1480. Yep.

46:18.197 --> 46:22.037
Grade I listed, so don't break it.
Here we go.

46:22.037 --> 46:27.157
Wipers! It's actually working. No,
it's not. You are going to hit it.

46:28.477 --> 46:31.197
We've crashed. The priceless bridge.
You're almost there.

46:31.197 --> 46:33.037
I'm bloody drenched, you idiot.

46:34.157 --> 46:36.437
'Having made a bit of a mess
of that bridge,

46:36.437 --> 46:40.037
'I came up with a cunning plan
for the next one.'

46:40.037 --> 46:43.957
I'm aiming for the "no entry"
on the basis that the hovercraft...

46:43.957 --> 46:49.117
That's the last place you'll go.
If you aim for something,
you'll not go there.

46:49.117 --> 46:52.317
'Unfortunately,
my plan didn't work.'

46:52.317 --> 46:56.277
It's gone where I aimed it.
Yes, but is it going to clear it?

46:56.277 --> 46:59.397
Oh, my God.
It's getting a bit scrapey...

47:06.357 --> 47:10.317
That's amazing. We did a thing!
We did a thing!

47:10.317 --> 47:12.037
Oh, God, rowers.

47:14.677 --> 47:17.797
Concentrate. Left, left, left.

47:17.797 --> 47:21.677
James, there's a man in a boat.
There's a man in a boat.

47:21.677 --> 47:25.157
You've got to miss him. That's
the RSC! There's a man in a boat.

47:25.157 --> 47:27.477
Miss him. Left, left.

47:27.477 --> 47:29.757
Oh, my God.

47:29.757 --> 47:32.277
Oh, my God. Where is he?

47:32.277 --> 47:37.917
He's here. He's here. I'm really
sorry. Sorry. Sorry, mate.

47:40.037 --> 47:42.117
We're probably not that welcome here.

47:43.597 --> 47:46.877
'We therefore decided it would
be best to get out of town.

47:50.077 --> 47:54.077
'But, in our haste,
we became tangled in the wash
from the camera boat.'

47:54.077 --> 47:58.557
This is not good.
We've lost all steering.
We are in deep BLEEP here.

47:58.557 --> 48:01.197
Brace, brace, brace.

48:01.197 --> 48:05.837
Brace, brace, brace. Hold tight.
Hold tight. Kill, kill, kill.

48:08.917 --> 48:10.197
What happened?

48:10.197 --> 48:14.397
The thing with hovercrafting
is it's brilliant, brilliant,
brilliant, disaster. Yeah.

48:17.397 --> 48:20.597
'Having apologised to the owners
of the boats we'd hit,

48:20.597 --> 48:23.037
'and the man who'd fallen in...'

48:23.037 --> 48:25.677
James May, consult the map.
Which way?

48:25.677 --> 48:29.397
To the left. '..we refuelled
and were soon on the move again.

48:30.717 --> 48:34.717
'And in the next village,
we decided to stop for some lunch.'

48:34.717 --> 48:38.597
I see a rather nice
little restaurant here.

48:38.597 --> 48:40.797
Yes, check this out.

48:40.797 --> 48:43.397
Private mooring for use by
restaurant customers only.

48:43.397 --> 48:47.637
Well, we're restaurant customers,
so we can. We're coming for lunch!

48:47.637 --> 48:53.077
'At this point, we discovered that
Jeremy hadn't learned how to park.'

48:53.077 --> 48:53.917
There we go.

48:55.837 --> 48:56.837
Oh, God, hang on.

49:01.917 --> 49:02.997
I've missed again.

49:07.037 --> 49:09.757
I think you've overdone it.
Where are you going to park?

49:09.757 --> 49:14.357
Why can't you just park it,
for God's sake? Sorry, sorry.

49:14.357 --> 49:16.917
Sorry, everybody. Sorry.
I'm not hungry.

49:16.917 --> 49:19.437
Why don't we just make a sign
that says "sorry"?

49:22.557 --> 49:24.957
'We decided to abandon lunch
at this point

49:24.957 --> 49:26.077
'and instead...

49:26.077 --> 49:31.677
'see how fast a hovervan
could run away.'

49:31.677 --> 49:37.077
OK, Hammond, give me read out
on the thrust. 7,500. 8,000.

49:39.037 --> 49:42.197
We are seriously moving now,
gentlemen.

49:43.717 --> 49:45.717
James, how fast are we going?

49:45.717 --> 49:48.357
I can work it out
with this piece of knotted rope

49:48.357 --> 49:51.757
like they did on HMS victory.
Go for it.

49:51.757 --> 49:54.637
This is looking good now.
We are in the cruise.

49:56.997 --> 49:59.677
Right, hang on, hang on. 20 in...

49:59.677 --> 50:05.877
We're doing 120 knots in an hour
which is 138 miles an hour.

50:05.877 --> 50:08.997
138. We are shifting now.

50:10.717 --> 50:15.397
'And the great thing is, of course,
hovervans cause no wash

50:15.397 --> 50:17.757
'so don't damage the wildlife
or the banks.'

50:19.397 --> 50:21.637
We're like a breeze.
Just a little gust.

50:22.797 --> 50:26.557
Oh, no, we're stopping. What's
happened? You've dropped the...

50:26.557 --> 50:28.597
We're sinking. We've gone down.

50:31.397 --> 50:33.117
That was, something went wrong.

50:33.117 --> 50:36.397
I think the skirt collapsed
at the front.

50:36.397 --> 50:40.157
'This meant we had to initiate
our emergency crash procedure.'

50:40.157 --> 50:45.717
Do you know what I think
this calls for, gentlemen?
A hit of oxygen. Oh, yes.

50:45.717 --> 50:48.157
A good idea.
Let's cheer ourselves up.

50:51.117 --> 50:53.397
Hey! Ah!

50:53.397 --> 50:56.117
Hang on a minute.
Why is yours so small?

50:59.437 --> 51:01.957
Why have they given you that one?

51:01.957 --> 51:05.677
They've given you
a sparkler canister from
a Watney's Party Seven.

51:05.677 --> 51:07.717
One more push,
and it will be out.

51:07.717 --> 51:10.437
Chaps, you do realise
what we've just done?

51:10.437 --> 51:12.757
We've exhausted the air supply.

51:12.757 --> 51:17.197
We've used all the oxygen for fun,
while sitting in a sinking van.

51:18.477 --> 51:22.677
This is Hovervan One
calling Avon rescue.

51:22.677 --> 51:26.357
Avon calling, Avon calling, help.

51:28.997 --> 51:32.117
'Happily, because we'd only covered
four of our 50 miles,

51:32.117 --> 51:33.997
'the crane didn't have far to come.

51:35.797 --> 51:37.517
'And after we'd fixed the skirt

51:37.517 --> 51:40.637
'and refuelled again,
we were back on the road.'

51:40.637 --> 51:46.997
Happy? Yep. All is going well
in the engine room. And relax.

51:49.437 --> 51:52.597
'Sadly, though,
the relaxing didn't last long.'

51:52.597 --> 51:55.357
Oh, God, there's a lock.
We've got to go through the lock.

51:55.357 --> 51:58.357
Can you go through locks in a...
Do they let hovercrafts in?

52:00.117 --> 52:02.717
'To make matters worse,
there was no lock keeper.'

52:04.357 --> 52:06.797
Do you two feel up to a lock?
I've never done one.

52:06.797 --> 52:08.397
Never done one in my life.

52:08.397 --> 52:11.557
You've got to get the water level,
but don't shilly-shally

52:11.557 --> 52:15.077
because I'm going to be
all by myself out here.

52:15.077 --> 52:19.117
'With Richard and James ashore...'
Go, go. Get off!

52:19.117 --> 52:21.877
'..I was a multitasking machine.'

52:21.877 --> 52:23.597
Oh, this is tricky.

52:23.597 --> 52:26.237
I'm having to drive
and do all the engine stuff.

52:26.237 --> 52:31.997
I am Mister Sulu, Scotty and Spock
all rolled into one here.

52:31.997 --> 52:36.717
Hang on, the water in the lock
has got to be the same level
as the boat.

52:36.717 --> 52:40.997
So we... So we have to go down
that end. No, no, no. Yes.

52:40.997 --> 52:44.877
No, really. I've got a two-gallon
fuel tank. Take your time!

52:44.877 --> 52:49.397
It's quite loud when
you're not on it, isn't it?

52:49.397 --> 52:52.237
People probably will have
to get used to the idea

52:52.237 --> 52:55.957
when people have hovervans that
canals are a little less tranquil

52:55.957 --> 53:00.597
than they have been historically.
It's a natural progression, really.

53:00.597 --> 53:06.277
You have the pony when canals first
began... Superhuman effort. Yes!

53:07.717 --> 53:10.917
..then internal combustion came
and boats got diesel engines.

53:10.917 --> 53:13.117
Now, this is the future.

53:14.637 --> 53:16.557
Here we go. Going in.

53:18.637 --> 53:20.557
Yes, bit of power.

53:20.557 --> 53:23.557
Power solves all things,
as we know.

53:26.517 --> 53:27.517
Yes!

53:29.997 --> 53:36.277
Right, if you wind, I'll push.
Ooohh! Look at this!

53:39.557 --> 53:41.997
Locking down. Are we locking
down, or... I don't know.

53:41.997 --> 53:44.597
We're locking down. Keep forward...
What the hell is that?

53:44.597 --> 53:48.117
The boat will go wherever it goes.
Close all the paddles. Yes.
What's a paddle?

53:48.117 --> 53:53.317
What are they doing? Honestly, my
dog would know how to work a lock.

53:53.317 --> 53:55.277
Look at them!

53:55.277 --> 54:00.717
Sorry. Going to have to do
the winding. It's down. What?

54:00.717 --> 54:06.357
It's down. Hammond, what are you
doing? What are YOU doing?

54:06.357 --> 54:10.637
Who's driving? Oh, BLEEP!

54:10.637 --> 54:13.597
I thought it would stay there.
Of course it won't!

54:13.597 --> 54:16.797
The hovercraft has run amok
in a lock.

54:16.797 --> 54:19.997
Get back on board!
Get in the hovercraft.

54:19.997 --> 54:22.157
'To try and capture
our errant hover van,

54:22.157 --> 54:24.757
'Hammond and I formed
a pincer movement.

54:25.917 --> 54:29.997
'But sadly, as I climbed on board,
the pincer movement
went a bit wrong.'

54:31.957 --> 54:33.157
Oh, no!

54:35.597 --> 54:36.597
Oh, no!

54:39.637 --> 54:41.077
I can't breathe!

54:47.797 --> 54:52.677
I can't breathe! I can't breathe!
Have you fallen in? No.

54:52.677 --> 54:56.717
I'm the wettest a human being
has ever been!

54:56.717 --> 54:59.477
Sitrep. We've...

54:59.477 --> 55:01.717
Ruined it. Well,
we've knocked a man out of his boat.

55:01.717 --> 55:05.957
Now we've jammed up the whole River
Avon. Now, here's what we must do.

55:05.957 --> 55:09.357
We must get it out of the lock
and then we will get a tow

55:09.357 --> 55:12.437
and then we can edit
all of this out.

55:14.197 --> 55:17.557
'Having done all of that,
we were back on the move...'

55:17.557 --> 55:21.437
James, which way is it here?
Keep right.

55:21.437 --> 55:26.637
'..and reflecting
on the many positives that had
come out of our journey so far.'

55:26.637 --> 55:29.757
We have had some calamities...
A couple.

55:29.757 --> 55:33.517
But they're not bad ones.
Not really. Weren't for us.

55:33.517 --> 55:37.117
Apart from the broken windscreen,

55:37.117 --> 55:42.557
the hover van is working
just as well as it ever has.

55:42.557 --> 55:44.077
Yes, it's expensive.

55:44.077 --> 55:46.637
I don't think we'd be able to sell
this for much less than

55:46.637 --> 55:48.797
a quarter of a million pounds.
Realistically, no.

55:48.797 --> 55:51.637
But... It's money well spent.

55:51.637 --> 55:56.517
..when you're up to here in
the sitting room and you
could have made your escape,

55:56.517 --> 56:00.557
you could have done
and you chose not to buy
one of these vans,

56:00.557 --> 56:02.677
that is, I think, the essence of it.

56:04.237 --> 56:07.877
Hang on a minute. What?
Hang on. What?

56:10.277 --> 56:13.877
Which way did you go back there?
You said right. I said left.

56:13.877 --> 56:17.837
No, you didn't, James.
You said right. Whoa... What's that?

56:17.837 --> 56:19.517
Is that a weir?

56:26.637 --> 56:29.517
Turn it round. Turning, turning.
Go the other way.

56:29.517 --> 56:34.757
Yamaha, give me every single rev
that Yamaha engine has got.

56:37.197 --> 56:41.517
Give it more. There is no more.
It's on the limit. There is no more.

56:41.517 --> 56:44.117
That's all there is.
We're being sucked.

56:46.197 --> 56:49.077
I'm going to turn it round.
Why are you turning right now?

56:49.077 --> 56:52.357
Do you want to go over backwards?
I don't want to go over it at all.

56:52.357 --> 56:56.397
He's right. Go over forwards.
It's better.

56:56.397 --> 56:57.837
Holy BLEEP! BLEEP!

56:57.837 --> 57:02.517
Hammond, I want every bit of lift
you can manage.

57:04.837 --> 57:07.197
I'm giving it everything it's got!
We're going over!

57:07.197 --> 57:09.797
We are going down! Oh, my God!

57:09.797 --> 57:14.197
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

57:17.357 --> 57:24.637
Yes! Oh, God, we're through!
It worked! It worked!

57:24.637 --> 57:27.437
We went down a weir!
And we're alive!

57:27.437 --> 57:30.197
What a machine! That's the best
thing I've ever survived!

57:30.197 --> 57:31.677
I knew that would be all right!

57:31.677 --> 57:35.717
Did you? I'm going to go back up.
Don't be bloody stupid.

57:35.717 --> 57:40.477
You couldn't turn it round up there,
it's not going to go back up.

57:40.477 --> 57:42.517
Yes, come on, hovervan.

57:42.517 --> 57:44.477
In the Shakespearean style,

57:44.477 --> 57:48.357
horsepower, horsepower,
my kingdom for some horsepower!

57:48.357 --> 57:51.677
It won't go up!
It will! It's not going to work!

57:51.677 --> 57:54.957
You can't give it
that many revs! Power!

58:00.957 --> 58:04.837
Power! Jeremy, that's too much...
Oh, my God! What's that smoke?

58:04.837 --> 58:07.037
You've ruined the engine!

58:07.037 --> 58:10.517
You've blown the engine up!
Come on! Power! You've killed it!

58:10.517 --> 58:13.197
Oh.

58:13.197 --> 58:15.357
You pillock!

58:21.837 --> 58:23.917
And with that, back to the studio.

58:31.437 --> 58:35.037
When Chuck Yeager
crashed that starfighter,

58:35.037 --> 58:36.437
nobody called him a pillock.

58:36.437 --> 58:39.797
No, but, it was because of you that
we didn't make it to Tewkesbury.

58:39.797 --> 58:43.637
It doesn't matter.
Everybody's seen the film now.

58:43.637 --> 58:46.237
They know that our hovervan
is as an unqualified success.

58:46.237 --> 58:51.877
Yes, yes, it is, apart from
the noise, the spray,
the terrible danger,

58:51.877 --> 58:55.797
impracticality, unreliability,
total uncontrollability,

58:55.797 --> 58:58.717
catastrophic fuel consumption,
terrible expense

58:58.717 --> 59:02.597
and disastrous damage we caused
to Warwickshire with it, yes.

59:02.597 --> 59:06.117
Yeah, apart from those
fundamental flaws,

59:06.117 --> 59:07.997
which render it completely useless,

59:07.997 --> 59:11.397
it is genuinely
a world-class machine.

59:11.397 --> 59:16.497
We have done something right. And
on that bombshell, it's time to end.

59:16.524 --> 59:19.384
Thank you so much for watching.
See you next week. Good night!
