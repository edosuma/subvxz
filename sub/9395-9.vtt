01:36.334 --> 01:37.594
How’s your punching hand?

01:37.818 --> 01:40.112
A lot better now that I nailed a guy’s face.

01:41.735 --> 01:43.026
How ‘bout you? How are you feeling?

01:43.782 --> 01:44.919
Like an idiot.

01:46.178 --> 01:48.717
Luke, you’re cool with us being just friends, right?

01:48.928 --> 01:51.304
I mean, we are friends, right?

01:51.790 --> 01:52.742
We are.

01:53.075 --> 01:54.833
- Okay.
- And I’m cool with it.

01:55.001 --> 01:59.936
And besides, I wasn’t ready for all that Peyton Sawyer/Girlfriend drama anyway, you know.

02:00.357 --> 02:02.117
Hey, say hi to Brooke for me?

02:03.180 --> 02:04.260
Alright. Talk to you later.

02:10.789 --> 02:11.520
Haley.

02:20.020 --> 02:22.310
Mmm, we can’t do this here right now.

02:22.403 --> 02:23.274
We just did…

02:24.651 --> 02:26.295
Alright, I’ll kiss you later.

02:36.314 --> 02:38.311
When you leave this gym today,

02:40.655 --> 02:44.824
I want each one of you to look at the sun,

02:46.171 --> 02:49.688
because if you lose to Cove City on Friday,

02:49.928 --> 02:51.945
I can pretty much guarantee you

02:52.621 --> 02:55.709
that sun will not rise the next day.

02:56.851 --> 02:58.141
That’s not a joke.

03:00.045 --> 03:04.089
I’ve coached some great players and great teams in this gym,

03:06.103 --> 03:10.843
but not one of those great players or great teams has finished a season undefeated.

03:11.212 --> 03:14.330
You may be the first.

03:14.950 --> 03:20.336
There are only two things separating you from greatness.

03:20.776 --> 03:23.859
Number one is Cove City.

03:24.237 --> 03:27.998
Number two… is you.

03:31.760 --> 03:32.824
Hey, Brooke!

03:35.389 --> 03:36.399
I’ve got something for you.

03:36.541 --> 03:38.001
I know you do, gorgeous.

03:39.475 --> 03:41.026
It’s that book I was telling you about.

03:41.903 --> 03:44.820
- I though you might want to check it out.
- Oh, I definitely want to check it out.

03:45.584 --> 03:49.357
I suppose I could read the book too. But what are you going to do for me?

03:49.613 --> 03:50.514
What do you mean?

03:50.863 --> 03:53.961
Well, I read the book. You do something for me.

03:54.518 --> 03:56.700
- Like what?
- I don’t know. Something fun.

03:57.213 --> 04:00.330
- Deal?
- Okay. Deal.

04:00.508 --> 04:02.813
Should we shake on it or just make out now?

04:06.043 --> 04:08.286
Who knew reading could be so much fun?

04:20.781 --> 04:21.726
Need some help?

04:23.400 --> 04:25.295
No. Everything is just fine.

04:26.174 --> 04:27.379
How about a cup of coffee?

04:31.474 --> 04:35.530
Deb, I know you claim your taking over the café’s not some sort of payback.

04:35.601 --> 04:38.208
It isn’t. I’m trying to help Karen.

04:41.428 --> 04:44.998
By ruining her business? That’s the worst cup of coffee I ever paid for.

04:45.156 --> 04:47.516
If you’ve come here to mock me, Dan, save it.

04:48.427 --> 04:49.892
I didn’t come here to mock you.

04:50.118 --> 04:52.615
I had a few hours. I thought maybe my wife could use my help.

04:53.743 --> 04:55.037
Clearly she can.

05:13.121 --> 05:14.258
How’s your sandwich?

05:15.839 --> 05:16.787
Almost warm.

05:17.832 --> 05:21.324
Well, I’ll start cooking again. Unless your mother comes to her senses.

05:22.552 --> 05:25.615
You know, just when I think things can’t get any weirder around here,

05:25.845 --> 05:27.616
Mom takes over Karen’s café.

05:29.316 --> 05:31.211
I think I’m going to invite Lucas over to spend the night.

05:33.821 --> 05:36.085
Well, your mother hasn’t exactly been herself lately.

05:37.135 --> 05:39.254
It might help if you tell her you’re happy.

05:39.501 --> 05:40.826
She thinks I’ve ruined your life.

05:42.632 --> 05:44.184
Cove City game’s coming up.

05:45.586 --> 05:48.769
Yeah. Whitey claims that if we lose, the sun doesn’t rise.

05:48.952 --> 05:50.538
Well, he might actually be right for once.

05:51.137 --> 05:53.944
Of course, you know who scored the most points against the Cavaliers?

05:55.112 --> 05:56.653
- 42.
- Yeah.

05:56.822 --> 05:59.735
- I’m looking to top that this week.
- No. You won’t.

06:01.300 --> 06:04.885
You want to know why? Because you’re not tough enough inside.

06:05.608 --> 06:09.023
I got coverage buckets you’ll never get because you can’t bang down low like I did.

06:10.225 --> 06:13.773
That plus the fact that your conditioning’s for crap. I never left the floor during a game.

06:14.931 --> 06:16.272
Hey, guys.

06:18.464 --> 06:20.804
I’m happy, Mom. Dad loves me.

06:24.803 --> 06:25.995
What was that all about?

06:26.406 --> 06:27.824
He was wondering where his mother was.

06:28.290 --> 06:31.203
Oh. Don’t start, Dan. I’m tired and I’m hungry.

06:31.264 --> 06:33.558
Oh, well. How about you eat first and then we argue?

06:33.834 --> 06:36.523
- How about we just don’t argue?
- How about we just don’t eat?

06:42.093 --> 06:43.076
What up, brother?

06:43.481 --> 06:44.914
You do know you’re white, Tim?

06:45.001 --> 06:45.769
What’s wrong with you?

06:46.701 --> 06:48.408
- Is your brother still dealing?
- Why?

06:48.927 --> 06:50.714
‘Cuz I need to tear it up against Cove City.

06:51.308 --> 06:52.588
So how’s getting high gonna help?

06:53.414 --> 06:55.846
Not weed, Tim. Performance enhancers.

06:56.388 --> 06:58.974
Look, just tell your brother that I’m gonna be on the floor for forty minutes,

06:59.031 --> 07:00.469
and I need to be in a different gear.

07:00.974 --> 07:01.949
You sure about this?

07:02.383 --> 07:03.935
Yeah. He’ll know what do get.

07:14.606 --> 07:16.883
So what, you going to avoid the café for the next six weeks?

07:17.867 --> 07:19.070
What, you don’t like pizza?

07:19.746 --> 07:22.388
I love pizza, but that’s not the point.

07:22.617 --> 07:26.607
Look, don’t you find it a bit strange, having Nathan’s mom running the café?

07:26.842 --> 07:29.013
Yeah. It’s a little strange.

07:29.724 --> 07:31.363
It’s also pretty gutsy of her.

07:31.791 --> 07:33.954
Dan’s gotta be giving her a lot of grief about it.

07:34.992 --> 07:37.523
You know, Luke, you really oughtta give her a chance.

07:38.143 --> 07:40.553
Deb’s okay. And when you think about it,

07:40.804 --> 07:44.803
when she got pregnant in college, her life changed a lot like your mom’s did.

07:45.093 --> 07:46.196
Yeah but Dan?

07:47.374 --> 07:49.436
Why does she stay with a guy like that?

07:50.132 --> 07:52.166
I don’t know. Maybe she wants to protect her son.

07:55.863 --> 07:59.191
Hey Handsome. Three more chapters and you’re all mine.

08:03.658 --> 08:04.802
What  was that all about?

08:05.832 --> 08:06.599
Nothing.

08:06.877 --> 08:09.967
Well I disagree. That was definitely something.

08:19.231 --> 08:20.116
Okay I got them.

08:21.474 --> 08:22.419
You sure about this?

08:22.867 --> 08:23.906
Have you met my dad?

08:24.985 --> 08:26.450
Okay, here’s the deal.

08:27.085 --> 08:28.549
These are basically amphetamines.

08:28.635 --> 08:31.984
They’re like, steroids on speed or speed on steroids.

08:32.615 --> 08:34.970
Anyway, you gotta be careful Nathan.

08:35.046 --> 08:36.633
Whatever  gets me jacked for Cove City, man.

08:36.715 --> 08:38.364
Here. These will definitely do that.

08:40.279 --> 08:43.587
Anyway, if you grow breasts… I get first peek.

08:48.062 --> 08:48.941
You’re welcome.

09:08.674 --> 09:11.163
Hold it. That was a foul.

09:11.480 --> 09:13.483
Nathan, you’ve got to get off his back.

09:13.549 --> 09:14.962
Why don’t you get off my back, Whitey?

09:17.348 --> 09:19.432
How would you like to call that a practice.

09:19.601 --> 09:21.131
Whatever, man, that’s fine by me.

09:21.326 --> 09:23.287
- Nathan!
- What?! Huh!

09:23.768 --> 09:25.141
What the hell do you all want from me?

09:25.997 --> 09:27.383
Just walk away, son.

09:28.204 --> 09:29.641
Walk away.

09:34.306 --> 09:35.875
Fight ball up top.

09:42.016 --> 09:42.820
Very funny.

09:43.527 --> 09:46.395
Hey, are you okay? Lucas said you had some trouble at practice yesterday.

09:46.670 --> 09:48.422
Lucas needs to mind his own business.

09:50.911 --> 09:53.377
We got a game coming up, that’s all. I just get a little intense.

09:53.767 --> 09:57.331
Are you, uh, okay? You’re shaking, Nathan.

09:58.329 --> 09:59.451
My heart’s racing too.

10:01.677 --> 10:03.061
That’s what happens when I’m around you.

10:06.990 --> 10:09.532
So your house tonight, right? Tutoring?

10:10.576 --> 10:12.388
- Are you sure you’re okay?
- Yeah, I’m fine.

10:12.456 --> 10:14.508
I just- I had a bad day yesterday.

10:14.911 --> 10:17.350
- See you tonight.
- Yeah.

10:36.647 --> 10:40.498
If you came here to lecture me or argue, I get enough of that at home with the wife.

10:40.636 --> 10:42.509
I came here to talk about Nathan.

10:42.905 --> 10:45.786
His behavior concerns me.

10:46.452 --> 10:49.986
Really. You put Lucas on the team, give away his position,

10:50.068 --> 10:52.244
kick him off the team bus 30 miles away from home,

10:52.340 --> 10:53.646
and now you’re worried.

10:54.762 --> 10:58.014
You forgot, uh, pressuring him and belittling him.

10:59.079 --> 11:01.166
Of course, that happens at home, doesn’t it?

11:04.643 --> 11:06.508
I remember when you came to me.

11:07.160 --> 11:10.800
You were a scrawny freshman with a hell of a jump shot.

11:13.180 --> 11:15.080
You loved the game.

11:16.140 --> 11:18.920
What the hell happened along the way?

11:19.328 --> 11:20.270
You happened.

11:21.413 --> 11:24.397
There was always something for you to pick apart, something that wasn’t good enough.

11:24.760 --> 11:26.933
But you are right. I did love the game.

11:27.116 --> 11:31.736
- I simply despised the way you controlled it.
- Who’s controlling Nathan now?

11:32.630 --> 11:36.896
You’d be ashamed if you learned to hate that person like you hate me.

11:39.119 --> 11:40.824
I might be tough on him, Whitey.

11:41.116 --> 11:45.871
But then I’m not the one who told him the sun wouldn’t rise if he lost his next game.

11:59.568 --> 12:02.066
You really laid into Whitey yesterday.

12:02.161 --> 12:03.541
He deserved it.

12:06.844 --> 12:08.963
So Cove City’s pretty tough, eh?

12:11.605 --> 12:12.342
They suck.

12:15.108 --> 12:15.978
Listen man.

12:16.870 --> 12:18.788
I know you’re under a lot of pressure from your dad.

12:18.855 --> 12:19.531
Hey!

12:20.279 --> 12:22.357
You don’t know anything about my dad, alright?

12:23.294 --> 12:26.413
Maybe if you knocked out a shot every now and then I wouldn’t have to carry us out there.

12:31.179 --> 12:33.862
All finished. Now it’s my turn.

12:34.083 --> 12:36.058
Hey, hey, hey. Not so fast.

12:36.913 --> 12:39.949
- Did you like it?
- Did I like it or did I read it?

12:40.815 --> 12:44.322
The book’s about how a guy loses his integrity and gives into temptation.

12:44.823 --> 12:48.756
Which is exactly what I see you doing tonight… with me.

12:51.783 --> 12:52.664
Right.

12:53.978 --> 12:56.144
Well, a deal’s a deal, right?

12:56.365 --> 12:58.361
That’s right, baby. A deal is a deal.

13:01.896 --> 13:02.769
Here you go.

13:08.704 --> 13:11.181
Thank you… Gretchen and Henry.

13:13.041 --> 13:16.625
Fake IDs. I used your yearbook photo.

13:22.041 --> 13:25.481
- I didn’t know you could shoot pool.
- There’s a lot you don’t know about me.

13:25.917 --> 13:26.603
Really?

13:29.291 --> 13:30.182
Like what?

13:31.513 --> 13:35.849
Like… I love it in the summer when there’s heat lightning at night.

13:37.156 --> 13:42.010
And up until the fourth grade, I called squirrels squirrlers.

13:45.113 --> 13:47.513
And I love beating boys at pool.

13:48.989 --> 13:53.729
Oh my God. A smile. Is Lucas Scott actually having fun?

13:54.666 --> 13:57.360
- I have fun.
- Sure you do.

13:57.937 --> 14:00.611
Lucas, you’re like the most serious guy I’ve ever met.

14:04.729 --> 14:05.475
Fine.

14:12.224 --> 14:13.396
Does that make you happy?

14:14.019 --> 14:14.629
A little.

14:16.298 --> 14:17.840
Well, just as long as you don’t feel cheated.

14:18.714 --> 14:19.519
You read a book,

14:20.646 --> 14:22.775
I drink a beer. We’re even, right?

14:23.677 --> 14:27.528
Wait, did you think this was the thing you have to do with me?

14:27.962 --> 14:28.971
Well, yeah.

14:29.211 --> 14:31.644
No. This isn‘t the thing.

14:32.605 --> 14:36.108
This is just… drinks before the thing.

14:37.413 --> 14:38.494
Bottoms up.

14:43.394 --> 14:46.911
Nathan. Are you going to pace all night, or can we get started?

14:47.541 --> 14:49.081
Are these all your brothers and sisters?

14:49.374 --> 14:51.622
Yeah. I’m the youngest.

14:52.087 --> 14:54.479
I don’t think my parents know what to do with the silence.

14:58.963 --> 15:02.410
So a month ago, did you think we’d be alone in your bedroom?

15:03.245 --> 15:05.057
Oh, but we’re not alone in my bedroom.

15:05.227 --> 15:07.992
-  We have the forefathers with us.
- They can watch.

15:09.235 --> 15:11.820
Nathan, can you just get serious for a minute?

15:11.922 --> 15:14.216
Oh, I’m serious. Come here.

15:24.869 --> 15:27.895
- My parents could come home.
- Come on…

15:32.853 --> 15:34.446
Nathan, come on, stop it.

15:35.511 --> 15:36.258
Come on…

15:37.866 --> 15:39.495
- Don’t… Hey!
- What?

15:40.606 --> 15:41.363
God…

15:45.306 --> 15:46.305
I think you should go.

15:49.095 --> 15:50.022
You’re kidding, right?

15:53.003 --> 15:53.688
Haley…

15:56.784 --> 16:00.235
Alright, Haley, I’m sorry. We can study, it’s fine.

16:00.926 --> 16:01.832
I’d like you to go.

16:05.827 --> 16:06.671
Unbelievable.

16:26.793 --> 16:28.648
Don’t you love weird science?

16:30.930 --> 16:32.483
Ah, the family jewels.

16:32.558 --> 16:34.612
He doesn’t even have a license, Lisa.

16:41.003 --> 16:41.816
Out of area?

16:43.164 --> 16:43.926
Booty call?

16:46.080 --> 16:48.708
Hey, this is Lucas’ cell phone. Please leave a message.

16:50.817 --> 16:51.969
Where were we?

16:53.013 --> 16:54.232
Where we were having fun.

16:56.827 --> 16:58.318
I’m glad we did this.

16:59.679 --> 17:00.510
Good.

17:02.327 --> 17:04.231
So what’s your take on tattoos?

17:05.855 --> 17:06.659
I don’t know…

17:07.442 --> 17:08.246
depends.

17:09.843 --> 17:10.560
Come here.

17:20.579 --> 17:21.398
What do you think…

17:22.673 --> 17:23.451
About…

17:26.844 --> 17:27.953
this tattoo?

17:31.243 --> 17:37.405
That tattoo is very, very… sexy.

17:38.003 --> 17:39.106
Right answer.

18:02.668 --> 18:05.016
Keith! Hey man.

18:06.292 --> 18:07.055
You okay?

18:08.683 --> 18:09.629
I’m perfect.

18:11.631 --> 18:12.814
Have you been drinking?

18:16.060 --> 18:18.497
Oh Keith. There is this girl.

18:19.926 --> 18:22.609
Now I know how my hope and Aunt felt when I came rolling in…

18:23.572 --> 18:25.266
You know, you had me worried sick, Luke?

18:27.243 --> 18:29.685
Why don’t you go and sleep it off and...

18:30.540 --> 18:31.779
we’ll deal with this tomorrow?

18:41.871 --> 18:45.312
What are you doing, Dad? Still looking for your name in the box scores?

18:49.659 --> 18:52.910
Hey. Knock it off and get serious. You’ve got a big game coming up.

18:55.229 --> 18:57.093
And you think you’re gonna break my scoring record.

19:05.101 --> 19:06.688
Come on, Tara Reid, you’re gonna be late.

19:09.519 --> 19:10.324
What’s up?

19:11.736 --> 19:12.586
Nothing.

19:13.000 --> 19:13.881
What are you hiding?

19:16.467 --> 19:17.492
Check that out.

19:17.788 --> 19:18.869
Tell me that’s a joke.

19:20.350 --> 19:23.431
No, no, no. Just, just… wipe it off, okay.

19:23.640 --> 19:24.715
Keith, it’s a tattoo.

19:25.130 --> 19:25.799
A tattoo.

19:26.881 --> 19:30.163
- Of what?
- It’s an ancient symbol for fun.

19:30.347 --> 19:34.295
Oh, for fun? Because I thought it was for freaking fool.

19:34.397 --> 19:35.811
- Keith…
- Luke.

19:36.547 --> 19:41.530
Your mom trusted me. She’s gone five days and now you scar yourself for life.

19:41.611 --> 19:45.098
- It’s just a tattoo.
- It’s a tattoo. There is no just.

19:46.394 --> 19:47.848
God. What were you thinking?

19:49.149 --> 19:53.562
This is a bunch of crap. You’re out half the night, you’re drunk, and now you got a tattoo.

19:54.166 --> 19:56.101
What, did you join the navy too?

19:57.284 --> 19:58.671
You took advantage of me, Luke.

19:58.881 --> 20:00.995
You’d have never would’ve pulled a stunt like this with your mom here.

20:01.114 --> 20:01.943
What stunt?

20:02.808 --> 20:04.867
You mean actually enjoying myself for once?

20:06.772 --> 20:08.031
You said it yourself.

20:08.692 --> 20:10.458
My mom’s not here. Is she?

20:10.868 --> 20:12.055
Your ass is grounded.

20:12.623 --> 20:13.330
Keith…

20:14.119 --> 20:15.080
Bread and water.

20:15.563 --> 20:17.647
Hard core grounded. Start now.

20:18.927 --> 20:19.818
You know…

20:20.579 --> 20:22.101
I expected more from you.

20:31.266 --> 20:32.152
What did you do last night?

20:32.663 --> 20:34.615
- Nothing, you?
- Nothing.

20:36.837 --> 20:38.738
Actually I kinda made out with Brooke.

20:40.421 --> 20:42.573
- What?
- While I was drunk.

20:42.761 --> 20:47.088
Oh. Wow. Slow night for you. What happened.

20:47.611 --> 20:50.544
Well, we went out as friends and things just kind of escalated.

20:50.616 --> 20:51.558
Yeah. Sounds like.

20:53.156 --> 20:55.228
You and Brooke Davis. Please.

20:55.694 --> 20:58.899
- What, is that so strange?
- Yeah, it is.

20:59.223 --> 21:00.871
You know, she’s different than people see?

21:01.838 --> 21:04.132
You of all people should understand that.

21:07.087 --> 21:08.450
I’ve been kissing Nathan.

21:09.822 --> 21:12.554
If I told you not to do that anymore would you listen?

21:12.832 --> 21:14.393
- Would you?
- Maybe.

21:14.848 --> 21:16.764
- Probably not.
- Probably not. Yeah.

21:18.700 --> 21:19.845
So what about Peyton?

21:20.378 --> 21:23.523
- Yeah, you can kiss her if you want.
- I’m serious.

21:24.239 --> 21:30.352
Look, I told her how I felt, alright? She doesn’t feel the same way.

21:30.496 --> 21:31.847
Maybe she’s just not ready.

21:31.970 --> 21:34.889
Nah. She just wants to be friends.

21:35.047 --> 21:37.710
So are you and Brooke Davis like a thing now?

21:38.320 --> 21:41.960
No. We went out. We had fun.

21:43.086 --> 21:47.095
Alright, well, if that’s what you want. I mean, you deserve to be happy.

21:47.326 --> 21:48.094
Yeah.

21:49.804 --> 21:50.500
You too.

21:58.462 --> 22:02.204
Hi, friend. Guess who I went out with last night. I’ll tell you. Lucas.

22:03.131 --> 22:04.329
Definite  went out.

22:04.478 --> 22:08.118
We met at a bar, shot some pool, had a few drinks.

22:08.221 --> 22:10.285
- Lucas Scott?
- Yep.

22:11.175 --> 22:13.146
You didn’t tell me he was such a good kisser.

22:15.887 --> 22:16.894
I gotta go.

22:24.237 --> 22:24.957
Hi…

22:25.828 --> 22:26.663
So what do you think?

22:27.657 --> 22:29.049
Uh, about what?

22:29.464 --> 22:31.840
Long counter here, some retro books.

22:32.459 --> 22:34.032
I don’t follow.

22:34.277 --> 22:36.702
Deb’s Diner. The hottest little place in town.

22:37.201 --> 22:42.044
Dan… I don’t want a diner. What’s this really about?

22:43.017 --> 22:44.035
You tell me.

22:44.849 --> 22:48.127
I told you. I’m simply trying to help Karen.

22:48.382 --> 22:49.708
You hardly know the woman.

22:49.770 --> 22:50.753
Well, that’s not true.

22:51.189 --> 22:54.281
But for the sake of discussion, lets say you’re right.

22:54.767 --> 22:56.811
Lets say I’m doing it to help you.

22:56.939 --> 22:57.618
Me?

22:58.105 --> 23:00.153
What do you feel when you see Lucas?

23:01.557 --> 23:04.696
I mean it was different when we never saw him. But now...

23:04.752 --> 23:08.060
- What do you want me to say?
- Anything. Something honest.

23:08.571 --> 23:13.584
Okay, then how does this sound? I was a kid, I made a decision.

23:13.675 --> 23:18.038
And I’m tired of you and everyone else holding it over my head every day of my life.

23:18.192 --> 23:21.136
So if you’re running that little café so you can find absolution for me, forget it.

23:21.187 --> 23:23.225
I don’t need it and I don’t want it.

23:30.066 --> 23:31.888
What’s going on? You said you wanted to talk.

23:34.658 --> 23:36.631
Do you think second chances are a lie?

23:37.438 --> 23:39.455
Well, it depends on who you are dealing with, I guess.

23:39.789 --> 23:40.592
Yeah…

23:42.353 --> 23:44.084
How are things going with you and Nathan?

23:47.706 --> 23:50.335
Not so great. I don’t know what he wants us to be.

23:50.453 --> 23:55.886
Are we a couple? Are we just hanging out? Is it for sex because if it is…

23:55.978 --> 23:56.976
If it is what?

23:58.133 --> 23:59.265
That’s not enough for me.

23:59.423 --> 24:00.314
Bad experience?

24:05.148 --> 24:07.128
What, are you a virgin?

24:07.426 --> 24:09.402
Yeah. So what if I am?

24:10.320 --> 24:11.138
Good for you.

24:17.077 --> 24:18.102
So what are you going to do?

24:18.439 --> 24:20.053
Try and get some answers I guess.

24:25.285 --> 24:27.307
Did Lucas tell you what happened between us?

24:30.169 --> 24:32.940
Yeah. He just said that you weren’t ready for a relationship.

24:35.703 --> 24:36.913
Did he tell you about Brooke?

24:37.302 --> 24:38.532
That they went out? Yeah…

24:40.210 --> 24:41.120
You okay with that?

24:42.268 --> 24:43.414
He’s fair game.

24:43.783 --> 24:47.102
Plus, she’s really not the dating kind, if you know what I mean.

24:49.564 --> 24:54.009
Is connecting with someone really this complicated, or is it simple and we just make it worse?

24:55.258 --> 24:57.158
For me its complicated.

24:57.900 --> 24:59.375
You just make it worse.

25:13.118 --> 25:16.808
Hey, I got you some tape.

25:18.063 --> 25:20.412
For the tattoo. You gotta cover it for the game, right?

25:20.561 --> 25:22.291
Thanks. I appreciate it.

25:22.905 --> 25:23.613
Let me see it.

25:29.521 --> 25:34.319
Geez, Luke. Where’d you get this thing? Some back alley in the Philippines?

25:35.749 --> 25:38.041
You know, you can get Hepatitis, HIV from..

25:41.862 --> 25:43.037
Does it hurt?

25:43.484 --> 25:44.256
A little.

25:44.927 --> 25:47.334
Well… we’ll get it checked before the game.

25:48.639 --> 25:49.980
Keith, man, you worry too much.

25:52.397 --> 25:54.712
I’ve got to worry once for myself and once for your mother.

26:05.413 --> 26:07.169
Your arms are going to be dead for the game tonight.

26:07.757 --> 26:08.909
Yeah. You wish.

26:09.703 --> 26:12.869
No I don’t. I’d love for you to break my record, Nathan.

26:13.082 --> 26:15.131
- I just don’t think you will.
- We’ll see about that.

26:16.432 --> 26:20.618
Good news and bad news, Nate. Bad news is I have to be at the café

26:20.676 --> 26:25.124
so I’m gonna miss your game. Good news is Haley can be there.

26:25.743 --> 26:26.389
Whatever.

26:28.586 --> 26:29.825
At least one of us will be there.

26:39.084 --> 26:41.136
- Nathan!
- Not now, Haley.

26:41.340 --> 26:43.495
Okay, after the game, can we get some food and talk?

26:43.557 --> 26:45.308
Haley, I said not now, okay?

26:45.579 --> 26:46.824
Why are you being like this?

26:46.977 --> 26:51.386
Because I can, okay? That’s how it works. People are mean, life’s a bitch.

26:51.565 --> 26:52.834
What is your problem?

26:53.401 --> 26:56.331
What’s my problem? My problem’s on the other side of the wall.

26:56.415 --> 26:59.305
And in five minutes, if I’m not perfect, they’re going to eat me alive.

26:59.486 --> 27:00.392
That’s my problem.

27:16.114 --> 27:20.591
That’s 38 points for Nathan Scott tonight, and we’re early in the fourth quarter.

27:20.862 --> 27:23.825
He’s 5 points from breaking the all time high against Cove City,

27:23.881 --> 27:25.878
set of course by He-Who-Won’t-Be-Named.

27:31.657 --> 27:34.937
Another 4 pointer for Nathan and now he’s a basket away from the record.

27:35.981 --> 27:36.667
Yeah, baby!

27:40.405 --> 27:41.235
This is it.

27:47.347 --> 27:48.566
No basket!

27:48.678 --> 27:51.832
Oh, no basket! Nathan Scott is whistled for charge-

27:51.873 --> 27:54.886
- He was moving at speed. What are you talking about?
- One! Two! Three! Easy, son.

27:54.982 --> 27:57.024
- Time out!
- Keep your eyes on the game!

27:57.194 --> 27:59.026
- Time out!
- Coach, you better watch your boy?

28:00.849 --> 28:01.811
What’s he doing?

28:06.568 --> 28:09.471
Nathan, I don’t care how many points you’ve got.

28:09.589 --> 28:14.131
You keep this up, I’ll move you so far down the bench they’ll have to pump air into you.

28:19.573 --> 28:20.489
Just give me the ball.

28:22.026 --> 28:23.786
Alright, lets go fellas. Defense on three.

28:23.859 --> 28:25.118
One! Two! Three! Defense!

28:25.724 --> 28:26.414
You alright?

28:26.900 --> 28:28.266
I will be 2 points from now.

28:33.571 --> 28:35.081
Here we go, folks. This is it!

28:36.019 --> 28:39.121
Luke waits for Nathan Scott to come free! He’s got 41 points.

28:58.248 --> 28:59.895
Coach! Coach!

29:14.000 --> 29:15.315
Easy, son.

29:16.489 --> 29:17.589
You’re okay.

29:19.711 --> 29:20.600
Can you hear me?

29:21.542 --> 29:22.253
Yeah.

29:23.293 --> 29:24.808
You collapsed during the game.

29:26.476 --> 29:29.416
Nathan, how are you feeling?

29:31.184 --> 29:32.339
I have to piss.

29:33.635 --> 29:35.309
You were severely dehydrated.

29:35.877 --> 29:38.857
We have you in these ice packs because you body temperature was very high.

29:39.687 --> 29:43.378
Now, I need to ask you some questions about the supplements you’re taking.

29:43.910 --> 29:46.072
Uh, Benzedrine, Mephedrine.

29:47.699 --> 29:50.736
Anabolic steroids? Anadrol, Dianabol?

29:52.892 --> 29:53.506
Okay.

29:54.387 --> 29:57.377
What about speed? And uh, cocaine? Ecstasy?

29:57.586 --> 29:59.614
Hey, Doc, he’s an athlete, not a junkie, okay?

30:00.034 --> 30:00.930
And he’s also a kid.

30:01.524 --> 30:03.352
True, but he’s my kid.

30:03.715 --> 30:06.433
So how about you play a little more doctor and a little less detective?

30:07.182 --> 30:09.214
Mr. Scott, could I speak with you?

30:16.495 --> 30:18.390
Listen to me, son. You’re going to be fine, okay?

30:19.189 --> 30:22.284
You’ve been hitting it a little hard lately, we’ll back a notch or two.

30:22.367 --> 30:23.433
You’ll be as good as new.

30:25.086 --> 30:27.656
Hell, the scouts won’t even remember this come to post season.

30:33.788 --> 30:37.687
The early results tell me that your son is going to be fine, physically.

30:37.795 --> 30:38.454
That’s great.

30:38.530 --> 30:41.804
But they also tell me he’s taking some sort of amphetamine.

30:42.485 --> 30:43.995
There’s got to be some kind of mistake.

30:44.553 --> 30:49.441
Mr. Scott, these kids are under a lot of pressure to perform, and granted, it could be an isolated case,

30:49.546 --> 30:52.402
but there could be a more serious problem.

30:52.586 --> 30:56.765
Look Doc, I appreciate your concern, I really do. But I gotta tell you.

30:56.836 --> 31:00.358
I know my son. And if he says he’s clean, he’s clean.

31:01.153 --> 31:03.687
So if you label him an addict, you take away his future.

31:04.112 --> 31:08.162
So unless you’ve got your results 100 percent accurate, you’re looking at a lawsuit you don’t want.

31:08.412 --> 31:11.714
Now from where I stand, your job is to get him well.

31:12.509 --> 31:13.435
I’ll do the rest.

31:14.300 --> 31:15.017
Are we clear?

31:17.772 --> 31:20.879
Hey. I was on my way to check on him, and then I realized you were here,

31:20.937 --> 31:23.774
so I turned around and came back. You should go. How is he?

31:23.956 --> 31:25.632
- Who?
- Nathan.

31:26.006 --> 31:26.896
What about him?

31:28.155 --> 31:30.679
I appreciate it, Keith. Thanks.

31:34.196 --> 31:35.232
How are you doing, son?

31:44.703 --> 31:45.589
He’s okay.

31:49.690 --> 31:50.807
Where is he?

32:17.898 --> 32:18.536
Hey.

32:21.009 --> 32:22.858
I talked to Dan.

32:23.585 --> 32:24.892
Nathan’s going to be fine.

32:28.702 --> 32:30.738
You know why they made whiskey, Keith?

32:33.549 --> 32:41.085
For the poor fool that wakes up after 35 years and discovers he’s a part of the problem.

32:47.639 --> 32:50.767
Well, no more.

32:51.941 --> 32:56.066
I’ll forfeit the damn games before I lose a boy to that.

32:58.843 --> 33:02.201
I’ve got to be the sorriest son of a bitch on the planet.

33:05.738 --> 33:09.486
Well, Karen left me to watch Luke.

33:09.861 --> 33:14.684
And uh, he got drunk and then he got a tattoo.

33:15.984 --> 33:17.248
Well, I take it back.

33:21.617 --> 33:23.767
I tried to call you but you weren’t answering your phone.

33:23.813 --> 33:28.390
Because I ran out of the café with nothing but my car keys and the fear that my son was dying.

33:28.446 --> 33:29.633
Oh, and that’s my fault?

33:29.757 --> 33:32.496
After Haley walked in… how long was that, Dan?

33:32.542 --> 33:35.578
20 minutes after Nathan collapsed? A half hour, maybe?

33:35.635 --> 33:38.164
My first concern was for Nathan. You’re overreacting.

33:38.226 --> 33:42.051
Oh. Overreacting? That my son nearly died and my husband didn’t see fit to call?

33:42.670 --> 33:45.476
Where is he, Dan? He could be anywhere. He could be unconscious.

33:45.553 --> 33:47.800
Get a hold of yourself. The doctor said he’s out of harm’s way.

33:47.866 --> 33:49.049
Well the doctor was wrong.

33:50.370 --> 33:53.739
Because as long as you control him the way you do, he’ll be in harm’s way.

33:53.825 --> 33:56.335
Ohhh… okay. Yeah, I get it. I’m to blame. It’s gotta be my fault.

33:56.397 --> 33:56.986
Yeah.

33:57.031 --> 34:00.032
Would you consider this, lady? If you weren’t off helping your little friend Karen and her café,

34:00.082 --> 34:01.824
you might’ve been there for him like I was.

34:03.555 --> 34:05.521
You smug son of a bitch.

34:07.389 --> 34:09.143
- I want you out of this house.
- Deb…

34:09.246 --> 34:10.860
I said get out!

34:11.855 --> 34:15.634
- It’s been an emotional night…
- No, no, no, Dan. It’s been a night of clarity.

34:16.063 --> 34:17.532
And it’s time for you to go.

34:19.313 --> 34:20.603
It’s my house.

34:21.357 --> 34:23.734
Fine, then I’ll go.

34:24.603 --> 34:26.601
But either way, Nathan stays with me.

34:27.920 --> 34:28.931
Don’t do this.

34:29.509 --> 34:31.141
I’ll say it one more time, Dan.

34:31.649 --> 34:33.710
Pack a bag and get out.

34:34.126 --> 34:36.856
Or so help me God, I will stab you in your sleep.

34:45.007 --> 34:48.165
And you better pray that my son is okay.

34:54.141 --> 34:56.909
Do you really think Nathan would choose you over me?

35:08.372 --> 35:09.783
Hey, its me.

35:12.008 --> 35:13.807
I guess I’m just worried about you.

35:15.978 --> 35:18.758
- I really hate the way we ended things.
- So do I.

35:22.358 --> 35:23.601
Nobody answered the door.

35:25.921 --> 35:27.242
They’re gone for the weekend.

35:31.325 --> 35:32.254
How are you?

35:33.602 --> 35:34.677
Not so good.

35:37.333 --> 35:38.096
Can I...

35:46.047 --> 35:48.419
I made a lot of mistakes, Haley.

35:52.526 --> 35:53.985
Sometimes because of my dad,

35:55.447 --> 35:57.277
sometimes by choice.

36:07.101 --> 36:08.608
I just can’t do it anymore.

36:10.808 --> 36:12.679
- It’s okay…
- No.

36:13.871 --> 36:16.087
No, it’s not okay. I’m not okay.

36:19.482 --> 36:21.003
I lived for tonight.

36:24.090 --> 36:25.360
I was so scared.

36:27.239 --> 36:28.421
I’m still terrified.

36:32.847 --> 36:34.452
Then I saw you.

36:35.805 --> 36:38.410
I promised myself that if I could just get up,

36:39.506 --> 36:41.083
and walk over to you,

36:42.523 --> 36:44.099
and tell you how much I need you,

36:45.860 --> 36:47.197
and how much I want you,

36:49.358 --> 36:50.868
that nothing else matters.

37:14.403 --> 37:15.066
Peyton?

37:15.783 --> 37:16.658
I heard about Nathan.

37:19.013 --> 37:19.606
Yeah,

37:21.814 --> 37:22.699
he’s gonna be okay.

37:25.347 --> 37:26.458
So… what’s up?

37:30.067 --> 37:31.686
Lucas, I made a mistake.

37:34.051 --> 37:38.284
When you said you wanted to be with me, I got, I got scared, but...

37:39.189 --> 37:40.081
Peyton…

37:40.194 --> 37:46.098
But, the truth is, I want all the same things that you want, I do.

37:47.700 --> 37:49.144
And I want them with you.

37:51.526 --> 37:53.855
Okay, superstar, are you ready to score?

37:56.692 --> 37:57.516
Hey…

37:59.819 --> 38:01.831
we missed you after the game tonight.

38:02.813 --> 38:08.067
Yeah. I just… I guess I just kind of got turned around.

38:11.003 --> 38:11.852
Peyton…

39:09.114 --> 39:10.151
Haley…

39:15.244 --> 39:16.846
Can I stay with you for tonight?

39:36.697 --> 39:38.482
What a frightening thing is the human,

39:40.496 --> 39:43.858
a mass of gages and dials and registers.

39:49.605 --> 39:51.247
And we can read only a few.

39:55.610 --> 39:58.006
And those perhaps not accurately.
