WEBVTT

00:06.006 --> 00:09.592
In an unexpected change,
our agenda now reads:

00:09.592 --> 00:13.972
One, Russia. Two, Russia. Three-- Julian?

00:13.972 --> 00:15.098
Russia?

00:15.098 --> 00:16.015
Russia.

00:16.641 --> 00:18.601
Welcome to our modest monstrosity.

00:18.601 --> 00:20.770
The indispensable Cecilia Dennison.

00:20.770 --> 00:22.689
Turns out she's the sister, not the wife.

00:22.689 --> 00:24.441
His wife died a couple of years ago.

00:24.441 --> 00:26.109
You should tap that.

00:26.109 --> 00:28.027
Do you understand
what we're talking about?

00:28.027 --> 00:30.572
Accusing Russia
of attacking a British warship.

00:30.572 --> 00:33.825
Tomorrow,
with the U.S. secretary of state.

00:33.825 --> 00:37.454
Trowbridge wants to reenact
the Siege of Leningrad.

00:37.454 --> 00:38.872
Sounds bad.

00:38.872 --> 00:40.290
What the fuck is this?

00:40.290 --> 00:41.666
You're the wife?

00:41.666 --> 00:45.253
You're so goddamn docile
I'd be psychotic to let you go?

00:45.253 --> 00:46.171
Yeah.

00:46.796 --> 00:48.298
A month into the Ukraine war,

00:48.298 --> 00:50.717
we'd already crawled
all the way up the diplomatic ladder.

00:50.717 --> 00:53.011
There are no moves left.

00:53.011 --> 00:57.432
It sounds like you wanna bomb something.
I have a list of Russian targets.

00:57.432 --> 01:00.643
Why don't you pick one,
and we'll blow something up?

01:22.207 --> 01:24.167
I would have preferred a warning.

01:24.167 --> 01:26.711
Before she suggested we lob explosives?

01:26.711 --> 01:27.962
I think we all would.

01:27.962 --> 01:29.839
Tell him the prime minister
will need

01:29.839 --> 01:31.549
the royal prerogative for military force.

01:31.549 --> 01:32.467
Tell who?

01:32.467 --> 01:35.845
Tell him that buys us a day more
if he pushes for parliamentary approval.

01:35.845 --> 01:36.763
Good evening.

01:36.763 --> 01:39.432
Office of the foreign secretary
for the defense secretary.

01:39.432 --> 01:40.850
The defense secretary?

01:40.850 --> 01:43.311
- I'm afraid it is urgent.
- You're bringing him here?

01:44.187 --> 01:46.648
You've got us targeting Russian assets
for air strikes,

01:46.648 --> 01:49.442
a move they've plainly stated
may result in a nuclear reply.

01:49.442 --> 01:53.113
- It's odd he's not here already.
- We do not need your defense secretary.

01:53.113 --> 01:55.115
We're not bombing anything.

01:55.115 --> 01:58.910
I gave him what he wanted
so he could stop wanting it so badly.

01:58.910 --> 02:01.830
No, you've made it acceptable
for him to want it.

02:01.830 --> 02:03.873
And to say America approves.

02:03.873 --> 02:07.168
I need my defense secretary here
because, thanks to you,

02:07.168 --> 02:09.712
I no longer hold sway
over the prime minister.

02:11.339 --> 02:14.300
I'm sorry, that happened
long before I opened my mouth.

02:26.396 --> 02:28.815
He's a big boy.
He dropped the ball. You picked it up.

02:28.815 --> 02:31.568
I made him look like an idiot.
It was a dick move.

02:31.568 --> 02:33.069
Was it the wrong dick move?

02:33.069 --> 02:36.072
I lack experience.
- No, you don't.

02:36.072 --> 02:40.493
I lack experience in this role,
and I panicked and did what you would do

02:40.493 --> 02:43.705
because it's the first thing
that popped in my head.

02:43.705 --> 02:47.375
You called DoD, you got a target list.
It's not a panic move.

02:47.375 --> 02:49.669
It was a premeditated dick move.

02:49.669 --> 02:51.129
It was effective.

02:51.129 --> 02:54.048
Making your ally look like a fuckwad
in front of his boss

02:54.048 --> 02:55.717
is not the only way out.

02:55.717 --> 02:57.677
Is it the first thing you tried?

02:58.761 --> 02:59.888
It was like the 80th.

03:01.431 --> 03:02.849
What if it doesn't work?

03:04.058 --> 03:06.561
I told him to bomb Russia.

03:06.561 --> 03:07.812
You have a plan.

03:08.313 --> 03:11.316
This was a move.
It's not the final destination.

03:13.526 --> 03:14.444
I'm gonna puke.

03:18.156 --> 03:19.240
Do we have more of this?

03:20.575 --> 03:21.534
Did you eat anything?

03:21.534 --> 03:22.744
No.

03:24.621 --> 03:25.455
Come on.

03:25.455 --> 03:26.372
Up.

03:54.776 --> 03:57.779
- Come on.
- I just need, like, a yogurt.

03:57.779 --> 04:00.073
I'm not getting you a fucking yogurt.

04:07.622 --> 04:09.749
- Okay.
- Fuck, look at that tart.

04:09.749 --> 04:13.086
Is it cheese?
No, no. Get one that's already started.

04:13.753 --> 04:15.546
- This one's started.
- Unbelievable.

04:15.546 --> 04:16.631
Mm!

04:21.344 --> 04:22.679
- Oh, my God.
- Right?

04:22.679 --> 04:24.472
Fuck. I'll grab some cheese.

04:26.432 --> 04:28.685
Get some of that spinach stuff too.

04:28.685 --> 04:30.853
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Did you get it?

04:36.943 --> 04:39.946
You know the wine cellars in this house
are older than your nation?

04:40.571 --> 04:41.406
I didn't.

04:42.532 --> 04:47.078
Bottled history. Some is rancid,
of course, hence the reinforcements.

04:47.078 --> 04:49.205
Sir, we'll get out of your way.

04:49.872 --> 04:52.750
I can't drink all three alone.
I'd look like a fucking alcoholic.

04:53.418 --> 04:55.628
Make yourself useful
and bring the stemware.

04:56.796 --> 04:59.382
Would you like us
to find someone from your staff?

05:00.300 --> 05:04.679
My staff? Every one of them,
the constitution of a BrontÃ« sister.

05:05.346 --> 05:07.515
It's their sworn duty to advise me,

05:07.515 --> 05:10.310
but the only one with the mettle
to discuss military options

05:10.310 --> 05:11.811
is an American female.

05:14.939 --> 05:17.567
I think
they're just trying to protect you.

05:18.276 --> 05:21.529
The Kremlin won't recognize anything
but brute force, we all know that.

05:22.697 --> 05:24.615
The only question is what form it'll take.

05:31.873 --> 05:33.833
Your staff won't give you military options

05:33.833 --> 05:36.878
because they can't trust you
not to use them.

05:38.212 --> 05:39.422
They don't trust me?

05:40.340 --> 05:41.507
Thick with irony.

05:41.507 --> 05:43.051
You don't trust them?

05:45.303 --> 05:47.138
It takes a team of mad geniuses

05:47.138 --> 05:49.932
to hoist one man
to the top of the greasy pole.

05:49.932 --> 05:53.311
And once you're in office, it's best to
sack them before they burn the place down.

05:55.146 --> 05:57.565
Then you're stuck in a sea of angry geese

05:57.565 --> 06:00.109
who spent all of recent memory
trying to destroy you.

06:02.987 --> 06:06.032
Austin Dennison has so thoroughly
colonized the moral high ground,

06:06.032 --> 06:07.992
I couldn't set foot there if I wanted to.

06:09.368 --> 06:10.703
Do you want to?

06:11.370 --> 06:13.498
No, Mrs. Wyler. No, I'm a bad man.

06:14.165 --> 06:16.459
I chose this path
because I adore raw power

06:16.459 --> 06:19.170
and I crave dank lodgings
in Central London.

06:25.843 --> 06:29.764
One year passed
between the German invasion of Poland

06:29.764 --> 06:31.641
and the start of the London Blitz.

06:32.391 --> 06:35.061
My country does not see
the destruction of Ukraine

06:35.061 --> 06:37.313
as a heartrending regional conflict.

06:37.313 --> 06:38.856
It will come here.

06:39.524 --> 06:42.110
We need not imagine it. We remember it.

06:47.907 --> 06:50.535
- Come on then. Back at me.
- You're a debater.

06:50.535 --> 06:53.788
- You can play both sides.
- That's cruel.

06:53.788 --> 06:55.248
It's fun to watch.

06:58.167 --> 07:00.670
"A dustup with Russia
is a puerile fantasy.

07:01.170 --> 07:04.465
Stop acting like a child, Nicol,
they'll stop treating you like one."

07:04.465 --> 07:09.053
I don't think it's childish.
It's pragmatic. Look at every real option.

07:09.804 --> 07:13.057
If you have a good one on the table,
you won't choose the bad one.

07:13.057 --> 07:15.643
I'm not afraid
to admit the bad one exists.

07:19.105 --> 07:20.440
She's got a good idea.

07:20.440 --> 07:22.525
She's going to turn it all around.

07:23.276 --> 07:24.110
She is.

07:28.656 --> 07:32.452
Don't play chicken with a country
that's ready to lob a tactical nuke.

07:32.452 --> 07:33.953
Try everything,

07:33.953 --> 07:35.663
everything before that.

07:35.663 --> 07:37.707
Well, I'm on the edge of my seat.

07:38.666 --> 07:43.421
Your city
is a 24-hour laundromat for dirty rubles.

07:43.421 --> 07:45.965
You have all their money. Take it.

07:51.721 --> 07:54.515
I should try Bruce.
He's probably still at the office.

07:54.515 --> 07:56.392
Yeah, it's still early there.

07:56.392 --> 07:57.768
- Andy.
- Yeah.

07:58.436 --> 08:00.104
- Craig.
- Yup.

08:00.104 --> 08:02.482
I'm not calling Dean.
I'll never get off the phone.

08:02.482 --> 08:03.649
You call him.

08:04.233 --> 08:06.777
And wake up Stuart.
We're gonna need more hands.

08:17.246 --> 08:18.664
What are you doing?

08:18.664 --> 08:21.250
Wives don't make calls, wives make drinks.

08:21.250 --> 08:23.503
You've had enough of those,
so I made you water.

08:25.171 --> 08:28.090
I was not that wife.
Not ever. I was your partner.

08:29.383 --> 08:31.636
You can pinch hit for one night.

08:32.970 --> 08:34.388
I don't want one night.

08:34.388 --> 08:36.057
I wanna be your partner.

08:36.057 --> 08:37.141
For life.

08:38.392 --> 08:39.268
You can't.

08:40.186 --> 08:44.023
If you give me a shot, I will.

08:44.023 --> 08:46.067
Constitutionally, Hal, you can't.

08:46.067 --> 08:48.110
You'll want to and you will fail.

08:48.110 --> 08:51.697
Fuck you. I gave you 15 years of my life.
Give me a chance.

08:51.697 --> 08:53.824
- So you can go to the White House?
- Katherine.

08:53.824 --> 08:56.327
So you're back-seat driving
the vice president?

08:57.828 --> 08:59.163
So I'm married to you.

09:14.011 --> 09:16.681
- You got a minute?
- Should I put on pants?

09:16.681 --> 09:20.393
I have a list of things
Kate would like you to take a look at.

09:20.977 --> 09:22.687
Cool. What's going on?

09:22.687 --> 09:26.274
Trowbridge is giving her a chance
to come up with something bloodless,

09:26.274 --> 09:29.402
- and it's gonna take some doing.
- Okay.

09:29.402 --> 09:32.905
She's got a 200-point plan
she needs to execute by morning.

09:32.905 --> 09:35.324
So all hands on deck.

09:35.324 --> 09:38.119
Oh. I thought she was ready
to call in the Air Force.

09:38.119 --> 09:41.038
That was a tactic, this is the strategy.

09:41.038 --> 09:45.376
It's a tactic she should run by her staff
and her opposite number.

09:45.376 --> 09:49.255
- That cowboy thing isn't gonna fly here.
- I think it just did.

09:49.255 --> 09:50.172
You know what--?

09:50.172 --> 09:53.718
I'd say talk to Kate about what it's like
to be DCM to an unpredictable ambassador,

09:53.718 --> 09:55.052
but she's busy.

09:55.052 --> 09:57.763
She's so busy, in fact,
she'd really appreciate it

09:57.763 --> 10:01.017
if you'd jump off your high horse
and make a couple of calls.

10:01.017 --> 10:02.518
I'm gonna say yes on the pants.

10:22.246 --> 10:23.623
I need to apologize.

10:25.166 --> 10:26.542
Perhaps in the morning.

10:26.542 --> 10:29.295
No, I need to-- Can I come in? Sorry.

10:29.295 --> 10:30.296
Um...

10:30.880 --> 10:35.259
So listen. I threw you under the bus,
but I think it worked.

10:35.259 --> 10:38.054
- I'm relieved.
- You gotta fucking get over it.

10:38.054 --> 10:39.055
We're a great team.

10:39.055 --> 10:42.975
You may not see that right now, but I do.
We are great together.

10:44.685 --> 10:45.519
Shit.

10:46.479 --> 10:51.317
I had a lot of wine,
and it was, um... old.

10:52.401 --> 10:54.737
- Are you--?
- I'm trying to say something, so let me.

10:54.737 --> 10:58.574
I don't know how you're gonna take it
and I don't wanna make you uncomfortable.

10:58.574 --> 11:01.369
- You don't have to--
- What I'm trying to say is, I need you.

11:01.369 --> 11:06.040
I know. I feel it too. I can't think
when you're in the same room.

11:06.040 --> 11:10.252
I can barely breathe. But I don't think
this is something that we can act on.

11:10.252 --> 11:12.296
Oh, no. Sorry, not that.

11:13.464 --> 11:15.174
- I'm so sorry.
- No.

11:15.174 --> 11:18.761
- I'm so sorry. I'm an idiot. I'm--
- No, I'm an idiot.

11:18.761 --> 11:21.847
- No, you're definitely not an idiot.
- You should go.

11:22.598 --> 11:23.432
Please.

11:24.975 --> 11:28.062
I was trying to say that
I was in the kitchen with Trowbridge,

11:28.062 --> 11:31.357
and now I need you
to call the Australian foreign minister.

11:33.317 --> 11:35.861
I don't metabolize red wine really well.

11:36.570 --> 11:39.907
You were picnicking in the moonlight
with the prime minister?

11:39.907 --> 11:42.159
- It wasn't planned.
- Did you knock on his door too?

11:42.159 --> 11:44.036
Of course I didn't. Jesus.

11:44.036 --> 11:46.622
Get yourself together. We have work to do.

11:50.084 --> 11:50.918
Shit.

11:51.919 --> 11:56.215
Yeah, I know it's late,
and she feels terrible about it,

11:56.215 --> 11:59.927
but do you think that you could--?
Yeah, they're in there.

11:59.927 --> 12:03.055
Yeah. Sorry.
Do you think you could wake him up anyway?

12:03.055 --> 12:05.599
- I've got it here. Go ahead.

12:05.599 --> 12:06.976
- Hi.
- Sorry.

12:06.976 --> 12:10.312
The ambassador wanted help
with a very complicated plan.

12:10.312 --> 12:11.439
Yeah. Come in.

12:11.439 --> 12:14.150
- I've got Anu setting up--
- No, we're all in here.

12:14.150 --> 12:16.318
- Yeah. Can you?
- I gotta head back into town.

12:16.318 --> 12:17.445
This late? What's up?

12:17.445 --> 12:20.406
I can't get a straight answer
on the intelligence.

12:20.406 --> 12:22.533
- Ronnie, please call me if anything...
- Yeah.

12:22.533 --> 12:23.451
Sir.

12:23.951 --> 12:26.162
I'm still here.
It can't really wait.

12:26.162 --> 12:29.206
- Knock, knock.
- Yes, the work's happening here.

12:29.206 --> 12:32.042
- Can I be of assistance?
Who else do we have?

12:32.042 --> 12:33.210
- Yup.
Okay, I see.

13:11.540 --> 13:13.125
I thought we said no surprises.

13:13.125 --> 13:14.418
What the fuck?

13:14.418 --> 13:18.130
- I feel like I was clear about it.
- I was trying not to wake you.

13:18.756 --> 13:20.633
- That's a gun.
- Yeah.

13:20.633 --> 13:21.800
With a silencer.

13:22.510 --> 13:23.469
It's what I had.

13:30.309 --> 13:32.478
- Are you hungry?
- I'm not hungry.

13:33.103 --> 13:36.273
I just stared down the business end
of a Glock, my adrenaline's hiked.

13:36.273 --> 13:37.191
It's not a Glock.

13:37.191 --> 13:40.236
- How much do I give a shit?
- I'm gonna make you an omelet.

13:40.236 --> 13:41.695
I don't want an omelet.

13:41.695 --> 13:44.698
I can put mushrooms on it.
I got those little ones you like.

13:45.658 --> 13:47.117
I don't want an omelet.

13:47.785 --> 13:51.413
I wanna know if the Kremlin ordered
the strike on the aircraft carrier

13:51.413 --> 13:53.123
or if it came from farther down the chain.

13:53.123 --> 13:54.083
You and me both.

13:54.083 --> 13:56.710
When I find out,
you will be the first to know.

13:58.087 --> 13:59.964
You will be the eighth to know.

14:02.007 --> 14:05.219
We are trying to stop the PM
from launching an air strike,

14:05.219 --> 14:07.763
and we have a tiny window
to sell him a diplomatic package,

14:07.763 --> 14:09.598
so sooner would be better than later.

14:09.598 --> 14:12.768
Oh, now that I know it's important,
I'll look harder.

14:12.768 --> 14:14.937
Up until now, I was looking medium.

14:14.937 --> 14:15.854
Okay.

14:21.652 --> 14:24.530
There's been Russian dark target movement
off the British coast.

14:25.698 --> 14:26.532
Submarines.

14:27.992 --> 14:29.243
Russian submarines?

14:29.952 --> 14:32.454
Which means they may know
we know it was them.

14:35.749 --> 14:39.336
I'm invested in the success
of your diplomatic solution.

15:02.651 --> 15:03.986
Let's talk about it.

15:03.986 --> 15:06.780
- Let's put it on the table and see--

15:14.413 --> 15:16.916
- I'd like them to go now.

15:31.722 --> 15:33.432
I fly to Novosibirsk,

15:34.183 --> 15:35.559
I find a bricklayer,

15:35.559 --> 15:38.228
I ask him, "You wanna marry an American?"

15:38.228 --> 15:42.149
The bricklayer says,
"No, I like only Chechen milkmaids."

15:43.692 --> 15:45.819
No, Don, you're the bricklayer.

15:47.363 --> 15:49.782
Yeah. No, I think this works out for you.

15:53.744 --> 15:55.996
That's fine. Call them now, I'll wait.

15:58.040 --> 15:58.874
We did it.

15:59.416 --> 16:01.085
- Confirmed?
- Yeah, we got it.

16:01.585 --> 16:03.337
That's incredible.

16:03.837 --> 16:04.672
Right?

16:05.464 --> 16:07.007
- Oh, my God.
- We did it.

16:07.007 --> 16:08.634
I can't believe it either.

16:09.385 --> 16:11.345
The notes. For when you pitch it.

16:15.307 --> 16:17.851
I'm not pitching this.
I can't even read it.

16:17.851 --> 16:18.936
It can't be me.

16:18.936 --> 16:19.853
Why not?

16:19.853 --> 16:21.605
British plan, British pitch.

16:21.605 --> 16:23.941
Then the defense secretary will pitch it.

16:23.941 --> 16:26.860
He won't be here
until the secretary of state is.

16:28.278 --> 16:31.949
I can't sell it to Ganon
unless Trowbridge is already on board.

16:36.578 --> 16:38.497
You didn't wanna tell me that last night?

16:41.125 --> 16:42.042
No.

16:44.753 --> 16:45.838
Stop.

16:45.838 --> 16:47.172
Come on. I mean it.

16:47.172 --> 16:48.674
- You do.
- No, come on.

16:48.674 --> 16:52.011
- I am underwhelmed by your team spirit.
- Shit! Fuck!

16:52.011 --> 16:55.389
- Oh. Uh, are you all right?
- Shit.

16:55.389 --> 16:56.598
- What--?
- Ow.

16:56.598 --> 16:57.516
What hurts?

16:58.142 --> 16:59.351
- That!
- Okay.

17:01.854 --> 17:03.981
All right, we'll stay here.

17:08.569 --> 17:09.778
Let me-- Let me see.

17:10.487 --> 17:12.406
- Ah?
- Ow.

17:12.406 --> 17:14.950
Hmm. Is it, um...

17:16.076 --> 17:17.828
- right there?
- Yeah.

17:19.371 --> 17:20.789
What do you think I did?

17:22.291 --> 17:24.543
I think you hurt it.

17:26.628 --> 17:27.629
You have no idea.

17:31.759 --> 17:34.553
- You have no idea what I did.
- I don't. I don't.

17:34.553 --> 17:37.056
But look how it calmed you.

17:39.933 --> 17:41.268
We'll get a professional.

17:41.268 --> 17:43.020
Get me some ice,

17:43.020 --> 17:45.314
and pitch the fucking package.

17:48.692 --> 17:49.985
I am wounded!

17:51.528 --> 17:53.781
And I don't like speaking
in front of a lot of people.

17:56.825 --> 18:00.579
Did you hurl yourself down a staircase

18:01.830 --> 18:05.250
in order to get out
of a three-minute oral presentation?

18:05.250 --> 18:06.293
No.

18:06.293 --> 18:09.296
Well, it's just something
my sister would do.

18:11.924 --> 18:13.759
I am not your sister.

18:14.635 --> 18:17.596
At this point,
that much ought to be clear.

18:24.228 --> 18:25.854
<i>From 10,000 feet,</i>

18:25.854 --> 18:28.607
the notion is to place
sufficient financial pressure

18:28.607 --> 18:32.444
on key personnel
to generate fissures within the Kremlin.

18:32.444 --> 18:33.570
Is that salt or pepper?

18:40.536 --> 18:41.370
Salt.

18:41.370 --> 18:42.287
Splendid.

18:42.788 --> 18:48.085
Uh, by freezing the assets of a handful of
Russian individuals in the City of London

18:48.085 --> 18:50.129
and Crown Dependencies.

18:50.129 --> 18:52.131
I get the idea. I don't love it.

18:53.715 --> 18:55.926
I think, in this case,
God is in the details.

18:55.926 --> 18:58.971
We need to bomb something
that smells like herring.

19:00.180 --> 19:03.600
I'm thinking Russian troops
in the Aleppo-Raqqa-Hamo triangle.

19:06.895 --> 19:10.732
No, we figured it out. It's exactly
what you agreed to last night.

19:10.732 --> 19:11.650
Oh, darling,

19:12.943 --> 19:16.864
any argument that includes the sentence,
"It's what you agreed to last night..."

19:17.698 --> 19:20.367
The Russian people
can't afford toothpaste,

19:20.367 --> 19:22.786
yet none of our sanctions
touch the Kremlin's money,

19:22.786 --> 19:25.956
which, ironically, is all in London.
We found a path.

19:25.956 --> 19:27.916
Is there no way to quiet you?

19:32.713 --> 19:33.755
When's Ganon arrive?

19:34.715 --> 19:35.591
Half-three.

19:35.591 --> 19:38.552
I'm staying.
Get on to this triangle business.

19:38.552 --> 19:41.013
I want you saying something coherent
when he arrives.

19:45.350 --> 19:46.351
Could be a break.

19:46.351 --> 19:49.062
- I don't have time for that.
- I'd like to do some imaging.

19:49.062 --> 19:52.691
Are you familiar
with the Aleppo-Raqqa-Hama triangle?

19:52.691 --> 19:55.027
- Pardon?
- It's a geographic location.

19:55.903 --> 19:58.947
- I'll take your word for it.
- Could you point it out on a map?

19:59.740 --> 20:01.700
- I'm afraid not.
- It's in Syria.

20:01.700 --> 20:03.118
Maybe get us a splint?

20:04.119 --> 20:06.830
- I'll see what I've got in the car.
- Thank you.

20:09.958 --> 20:13.712
People do not know
about the Aleppo-Raqqa-Hama triangle.

20:13.712 --> 20:14.922
Trowbridge isn't people.

20:14.922 --> 20:17.466
He's the prime minister
of a well-regarded nation-state.

20:18.383 --> 20:20.552
He called it "Hamo." Not Hama.

20:20.552 --> 20:22.638
- You called me Jake once.
-"Hamo."

20:23.263 --> 20:25.974
Are you upset he got it wrong
or that he wants to bomb it?

20:25.974 --> 20:29.770
It's like he was parroting someone.
He must have talked to someone last night.

20:31.271 --> 20:35.359
Maybe the defense secretary?
Is he a Russia hawk? Where are you going?

20:36.860 --> 20:38.946
- Wanna check out the garden?
- No.

20:40.697 --> 20:42.199
I want you to.

20:43.367 --> 20:46.536
Hal, for fuck's sake, if this is you
back to being the trailing spouse

20:46.536 --> 20:48.956
with some well-meaning bid
to get me some air...

20:48.956 --> 20:52.960
You know when I swore to you
that all I did was just be a good wife

20:52.960 --> 20:56.380
- and I never heard anything of substance?
- Yeah.

20:57.798 --> 20:58.632
I lied.

21:04.972 --> 21:07.766
Tell Kate why he's here.
The prime minister.

21:07.766 --> 21:09.393
Tell her about Maggie.

21:09.393 --> 21:10.852
Ugh. Margaret Roylin.

21:10.852 --> 21:13.522
I tried to introduce you at the memorial.

21:13.522 --> 21:15.649
She's Trowbridge's former advisor.

21:15.649 --> 21:19.403
Nicol can't resist her cardigans
and compression socks.

21:19.945 --> 21:23.532
- You know about her name?
- She told me to call her Meg.

21:23.532 --> 21:24.616
She does that.

21:25.284 --> 21:28.870
Tried to convince everyone she wasn't
a new Maggie, running things at Number 10,

21:28.870 --> 21:30.372
it's what they all said.

21:31.290 --> 21:33.250
Made Nicol livid.

21:33.875 --> 21:35.127
She had to be sacked.

21:35.711 --> 21:38.088
She thinks he still talks to her.

21:38.714 --> 21:41.341
She's got a charming place
just down the way.

21:41.341 --> 21:42.634
- From here?
Mm-hm.

21:42.634 --> 21:47.180
Making this place, and you,
a perfect beard for a meeting with Roylin.

21:47.973 --> 21:49.808
I have to tell Dennison.

21:49.808 --> 21:51.727
My brother's well aware.

21:52.561 --> 21:55.022
What--? Then why hasn't he said anything?

21:56.315 --> 22:00.902
It must be so hard
to be so spirited and yet so ill-informed.

22:02.112 --> 22:04.781
You know every multilateral treaty
by clause,

22:04.781 --> 22:07.826
and yet you don't know
what the <i>Daily Mail</i> said about my brother.

22:09.494 --> 22:11.163
What did the <i>Daily Mail</i> say?

22:11.788 --> 22:16.585
Nonsense, really, but Roylin
and her friends at the <i>Mail</i> are the reason

22:16.585 --> 22:20.797
why Nicol Trowbridge is prime minister
and not Austin Dennison.

22:21.381 --> 22:26.345
He seems to think
if he simply ignores her, she'll vanish.

22:28.638 --> 22:30.766
Russia is in Syria fighting ISIS,

22:30.766 --> 22:34.644
to attack Russia in Syria
is to provoke Russia while aiding ISIS.

22:34.644 --> 22:36.646
In case that's of any concern.

22:36.646 --> 22:38.023
I mean, it is, but--

22:40.817 --> 22:41.818
I think it is.

22:43.612 --> 22:45.989
Why am I hearing from your sister
and not you

22:45.989 --> 22:50.118
that Margaret Roylin has a fucking
"charming place just down the way"?

22:51.661 --> 22:55.582
A direct hit on Russian soldiers
in the Aleppo-Raqqa-Hama triangle?

22:56.458 --> 22:57.918
He's talking to Roylin.

22:58.919 --> 23:00.879
I've limited her sway.

23:01.713 --> 23:04.007
You haven't. We need to talk to her.

23:04.007 --> 23:07.511
- Absolutely not.
- She is the person we're negotiating with.

23:07.511 --> 23:10.555
- Talking to her gives her credibility.
- I'll do it.

23:10.555 --> 23:11.723
No, you won't.

23:11.723 --> 23:15.060
I will handle Trowbridge
without Margaret Roylin.

23:15.060 --> 23:20.482
And ideally, if you would be so kind,
without you.

23:25.779 --> 23:27.405
We had a good working relationship,

23:27.405 --> 23:30.242
and now you're embarrassed
about what happened last night,

23:30.242 --> 23:32.160
so you're trying to blow it up.

23:32.160 --> 23:34.204
- I don't--
- You're not crazy.

23:34.996 --> 23:36.373
My marriage is ending,

23:36.373 --> 23:40.377
and it hasn't escaped me
that you are an incredibly...

23:42.337 --> 23:45.715
attractive, intelligent, compassionate...

23:47.717 --> 23:48.552
man.

23:49.553 --> 23:52.264
It's something
I spend a lot of time thinking about.

23:52.264 --> 23:55.517
But at the moment,
we have bigger fish to fry.

23:58.770 --> 24:00.605
Don't speak to Margaret Roylin.

24:15.495 --> 24:16.329
Do it.

24:20.834 --> 24:21.668
You sure?

24:25.797 --> 24:30.010
Well, you can't keep it, of course.
The papers would flay you.

24:30.635 --> 24:33.138
Some lunk in the village
took a snap with his phone.

24:33.138 --> 24:35.140
I don't think he knew it was me.

24:36.558 --> 24:39.895
Might I take it for a quick spin
before she goes bye-bye?

24:40.520 --> 24:42.647
Lend my baby to a profligate drunk?

24:42.647 --> 24:44.149
You crashed the weekend.

24:44.149 --> 24:46.735
Go on.
Be a darling, let me crash your car.

25:09.132 --> 25:10.884
<i>- remains there on 72,</i>

25:10.884 --> 25:12.385
<i>- from 42 deliveries.</i>

25:12.385 --> 25:15.639
<i>He's been the one constant
at the top of the order...</i>

25:16.598 --> 25:17.766
Wilson speaking.

25:17.766 --> 25:21.519
Are you skulking around the back gate
listening to the cricket?

25:21.519 --> 25:24.439
<i>- Yes, ma'am.</i>
- I'm coming through, open up.

25:24.439 --> 25:25.649
<i>Understood, ma'am.</i>

25:30.820 --> 25:32.155
Thank you, Wilson!

25:33.949 --> 25:35.951
<i>The umpire is reviewing the play...</i>

25:43.959 --> 25:44.793
Hi.

25:44.793 --> 25:46.670
<i>We're trying to find the ambassador.</i>

25:46.670 --> 25:50.048
- You lost her?
<i>- Not lost. But Byron can't find her,</i>

25:50.048 --> 25:51.633
<i>- and neither can we.</i>
- Okay.

25:57.639 --> 25:58.473
Yup.

25:58.473 --> 26:00.392
Why does Ronnie think you're AWOL?

26:01.142 --> 26:03.478
I'm out for a drive.

26:04.145 --> 26:07.482
- You should be on the way to the airport.
- Fuck.

26:08.233 --> 26:10.568
Yeah, Ganon lands in 20 minutes.

26:11.528 --> 26:12.362
Send Hal.

26:12.362 --> 26:14.364
Hal is not the ambassador.

26:14.948 --> 26:17.826
He is an ambassador, and he'll swoop in.

26:17.826 --> 26:19.369
He's good at all that.

26:20.912 --> 26:24.124
<i>Ma'am, where exactly are you?</i>

26:24.124 --> 26:25.917
<i>Ma'am, you should be up--</i>

26:32.257 --> 26:34.467
Relationships like that are rare.

26:34.467 --> 26:35.468
You and Hal.

26:37.304 --> 26:38.138
Yeah.

26:38.930 --> 26:40.557
Not like that in my family.

26:41.433 --> 26:42.976
Not even your brothers?

26:42.976 --> 26:45.812
That's a disaster
for its own special reasons.

26:47.689 --> 26:50.483
What did the <i>Daily Mail</i> say
about your brother?

26:51.693 --> 26:53.069
Ancient history now.

26:55.363 --> 26:57.699
I'm meeting Maggie. Shouldn't I know?

26:59.534 --> 27:04.164
By the end of the campaign,
I was rather low. I'd lost a baby.

27:06.041 --> 27:09.044
My partner had me in a setup
akin to house arrest.

27:10.211 --> 27:11.338
He blamed me.

27:12.964 --> 27:14.090
That's awful.

27:14.090 --> 27:17.093
I told Austin I'd jump off the roof
if I didn't get any oxy.

27:17.093 --> 27:20.263
- Ah.
- So he got it for me.

27:20.889 --> 27:23.224
Illegal prescription, abuse of office.

27:23.933 --> 27:25.769
And the <i>Daily Mail</i> found out.

27:25.769 --> 27:27.771
Roylin found out.

27:28.480 --> 27:33.276
She fed it to the tabloids as a story
about my brother having a pill problem.

27:35.737 --> 27:36.780
He can't forgive her.

27:37.364 --> 27:38.782
It's unforgivable.

27:39.699 --> 27:41.117
I admire her efficacy.

27:42.452 --> 27:43.453
I'm so sorry.

27:44.037 --> 27:46.331
Be a darling, don't mention it to Roylin.

27:47.123 --> 27:47.957
Of course.

27:47.957 --> 27:50.043
Wouldn't want her to think I care.

28:08.520 --> 28:10.605
Good to see you too, Mr. Secretary.

28:25.120 --> 28:27.414
You know what I told the president
when he asked me

28:27.414 --> 28:30.625
about sending your wife
to a Tiffany post like London?

28:30.625 --> 28:32.794
As I understand it, he didn't ask.

28:32.794 --> 28:35.296
I said you're not gonna get her,
you're gonna get Hal.

28:35.296 --> 28:37.882
I've always just been
the lunk standing behind her,

28:37.882 --> 28:39.259
holding her back.

28:39.259 --> 28:40.718
We should be so lucky.

28:40.718 --> 28:41.928
Actually, you are.

28:42.470 --> 28:44.597
- Trowbridge can't get enough of her.
- What?

28:44.597 --> 28:45.890
He showed up yesterday.

28:45.890 --> 28:47.308
Doesn't wanna leave.

28:48.309 --> 28:51.646
So now I have another Wyler fucking
my relationship with the White House.

28:51.646 --> 28:53.064
She'll smooth it out.

28:53.982 --> 28:57.902
Talked him back from the brink yesterday,
just needs to iron out a couple of things.

28:57.902 --> 29:00.196
You've been in
the wilds of Arabia for too long,

29:00.196 --> 29:01.740
so let me spell it out.

29:01.740 --> 29:03.908
The ambassador in London has one job:

29:03.908 --> 29:06.453
Greet me at the fucking airport.

29:06.453 --> 29:09.038
You never sent Val to do anything for you?

29:09.622 --> 29:11.750
It's something worth thinking about.

29:13.251 --> 29:14.836
- You okay?

29:17.046 --> 29:17.881
Look at this.

29:19.424 --> 29:21.134
- Looks bad.
- Yeah, heat rash.

29:21.134 --> 29:22.677
Val thinks it's all the flying.

29:24.053 --> 29:26.139
- Does it itch?
- What do you think?

29:26.139 --> 29:29.517
I didn't fly nine hours
to play lawn croquet with Nicol Trickle

29:29.517 --> 29:31.269
while Kate Wyler does the real work.

29:33.062 --> 29:34.481
It's closer to seven. Isn't it?

29:34.481 --> 29:35.482
What?

29:35.482 --> 29:37.400
Hours. From D.C.

29:42.697 --> 29:43.531
Just saying.

29:46.743 --> 29:48.953
One in from the corner.
On the right.

29:49.579 --> 29:50.622
Why not the corner?

29:51.539 --> 29:52.874
"Congratulations, Tom,

29:52.874 --> 29:55.001
that's double the size
of your last office."

29:55.001 --> 29:58.004
It looks great. I just thought
you were talking about the corner.

29:58.004 --> 29:59.214
Give me those back.

30:01.216 --> 30:02.050
What you got?

30:03.718 --> 30:04.552
Nothing.

30:05.303 --> 30:06.387
What have you got?

30:07.555 --> 30:08.598
For chrissake.

30:08.598 --> 30:10.767
I'm sorry I slagged on your office.

30:10.767 --> 30:12.310
I'm not withholding intelligence

30:12.310 --> 30:16.314
because you failed to register
the significance of my new quarters,

30:16.314 --> 30:18.191
I'm in receive mode.

30:19.192 --> 30:20.068
Why?

30:20.068 --> 30:23.530
Because having collated
all of the information we gathered

30:23.530 --> 30:26.366
from all of our sources
in Russian military intelligence,

30:26.366 --> 30:29.702
it's quite clear
that this was an FSB plan.

30:29.702 --> 30:32.080
My contacts said the FSB didn't do it.

30:32.831 --> 30:34.249
They said it was GRU.

30:35.792 --> 30:38.002
- They're wrong.
- And this is a contact you trust?

30:38.002 --> 30:40.630
No, I went
to my chronically unreliable contact.

30:41.214 --> 30:42.048
Shit.

30:43.132 --> 30:44.133
All right.

30:45.301 --> 30:46.845
Possible explanations.

30:47.470 --> 30:48.304
They're lying.

30:48.304 --> 30:49.681
One, they're lying.

30:49.681 --> 30:51.266
Two, the Kremlin did this

30:51.266 --> 30:55.562
without consulting a single piece
of Russian intelligence apparatus.

30:57.063 --> 31:02.110
Three, it's not Russia. My money's on two.

31:02.110 --> 31:03.027
Yeah.

31:03.736 --> 31:04.821
That sounds right.

31:05.488 --> 31:07.699
I'll talk to a couple
of the chattier oligarchs,

31:07.699 --> 31:10.451
see if anyone's heard about this
from the inner circle.

31:11.119 --> 31:13.121
Anything new on the submarines?

31:13.121 --> 31:17.000
They're hovering over the fiber-optic
cables running out of Cornwall.

31:17.584 --> 31:18.793
Eavesdropping?

31:18.793 --> 31:22.338
That or planning to strike back
in case we make a move.

31:24.549 --> 31:25.717
It's a nice office.

31:26.509 --> 31:28.011
You're a terrible person.

31:51.117 --> 31:55.079
Hello. I'm having a battle royale
with a hedgehog.

31:55.663 --> 31:57.624
Oh, you out spreading poison?

31:58.875 --> 32:00.919
Oh, come on. I couldn't resist.

32:02.629 --> 32:04.505
Come in. I'll make us some tea.

32:04.505 --> 32:07.091
I'm not going
into your musty Hobbit house.

32:07.091 --> 32:09.135
I'll go and inspect the garden.

32:09.677 --> 32:12.639
Find some new shoots.
Grind them beneath my feet.

32:21.814 --> 32:23.399
Nicol says you're very bright.

32:24.692 --> 32:26.486
What do you think the tabloids would do

32:26.486 --> 32:30.657
if they knew an unemployed pollster
with no military experience

32:30.657 --> 32:32.784
was choosing targets for the RAF?

32:33.493 --> 32:34.327
Milk?

32:35.119 --> 32:36.162
Black.

32:36.162 --> 32:39.457
Milk-in-first suggests
you're of the dusty masses.

32:39.457 --> 32:41.501
Would have thought
that might appeal to you.

32:42.001 --> 32:45.380
Under no circumstances
will President Rayburn support an attack

32:45.380 --> 32:49.133
on Russian forces
in the Aleppo-Raqqa-Hama triangle.

32:49.133 --> 32:50.051
No?

32:50.051 --> 32:53.054
If the PM proposes that,
Ganon will have to leave.

32:54.347 --> 32:56.307
Why are you letting Nicol stay?

32:56.307 --> 32:59.310
Makes your president look like an old nag,

32:59.978 --> 33:03.648
left to warm his joints by the fire
while real men hash it out.

33:04.899 --> 33:06.609
Why are you letting him stay?

33:07.902 --> 33:08.736
Please.

33:11.072 --> 33:15.660
Reports of my Svengali powers
are much exaggerated.

33:15.660 --> 33:19.414
You don't want to open
a Middle Eastern front with Russia.

33:19.956 --> 33:20.790
I don't.

33:21.749 --> 33:23.042
Then why are you pushing it?

33:26.045 --> 33:28.423
I thought you'd be different
than your husband.

33:30.383 --> 33:32.343
Yeah. I thought so too.

33:33.469 --> 33:34.595
Bluster and fuss.

33:35.179 --> 33:39.642
Pull-asides at the urinal, and,
"Let's end this now, just you and me."

33:41.686 --> 33:42.979
Would that be so bad?

33:43.604 --> 33:45.982
To end it right now, just you and me?

33:47.900 --> 33:48.860
Hmm.

33:51.529 --> 33:52.363
Come here.

33:57.243 --> 33:58.578
You know what this is?

33:59.162 --> 33:59.996
Scotland.

33:59.996 --> 34:01.414
Hooray!

34:01.414 --> 34:04.042
They taught you something on the airplane.

34:04.042 --> 34:07.378
Let's test your recent British history.

34:08.212 --> 34:12.717
"Take back control." "Leave means leave."
My personal favorite, "No, thanks."

34:13.718 --> 34:14.844
Brexit slogans.

34:14.844 --> 34:17.847
Yes. But they're being repurposed...

34:19.724 --> 34:21.517
for the independence movement.

34:22.602 --> 34:27.482
"No, thanks" is trending on
the surprisingly active Twitter community

34:27.482 --> 34:30.526
of East Kilbride, Strathaven,
and Lesmahagow.

34:31.194 --> 34:34.280
Their representative in parliament
just dropped dead.

34:35.114 --> 34:37.366
His wife will likely win his seat.

34:37.950 --> 34:40.244
He was a royalist, but she says...

34:41.329 --> 34:42.330
"No, thanks."

34:42.330 --> 34:47.585
Her vote will force the prime minister to
call for a second referendum in Scotland.

34:47.585 --> 34:51.839
There's a very real chance
that Scotland will declare independence.

34:52.590 --> 34:54.634
Northern Ireland will follow.

34:55.760 --> 34:58.805
The Welsh do everything slowly,
but eventually they'll get the idea.

34:59.680 --> 35:03.434
The first line
of Nicol Trowbridge's obituary

35:04.227 --> 35:07.897
will declare him "the prime minister
that lost the United Kingdom."

35:10.066 --> 35:14.487
He won't accept a response to Russia
that doesn't help him keep the kingdom.

35:14.487 --> 35:17.240
You think war with Russia
will give him that?

35:17.240 --> 35:18.866
No, of course not.

35:18.866 --> 35:21.077
He needs one shining moment of unity

35:21.077 --> 35:23.996
to get him past
the referendum in Scotland.

35:23.996 --> 35:26.999
And your words
seemed to have a clarifying effect.

35:26.999 --> 35:28.209
How did you put it?

35:29.418 --> 35:31.003
"Let's bomb something."

35:33.339 --> 35:35.633
The ambassador has a question.

35:35.633 --> 35:38.344
The ambassador would be wise
to make an appearance.

35:38.344 --> 35:41.556
- The secretary of state looks homicidal.
You can't find it anywhere.

35:41.556 --> 35:45.726
Can we look over this way, sir?
If we needed something pyrotechnic,

35:45.726 --> 35:47.061
small...

35:48.563 --> 35:49.981
British Special Forces.

35:55.069 --> 35:58.990
If we hit Russia, Russia hits back.

35:58.990 --> 36:03.911
But the Lenkov Group isn't Russia. Right?
That's what the Kremlin keeps saying.

36:05.079 --> 36:09.417
They are the Kremlin's private army
pretending to be mercenaries.

36:09.417 --> 36:10.918
But sometimes,

36:10.918 --> 36:13.171
because it's a really good way
to make money,

36:13.171 --> 36:15.298
they do work as mercenaries.

36:16.799 --> 36:19.218
Butchering civilians
for dictators on four continents.

36:19.218 --> 36:22.054
She wants us to hit the Lenkov Group?

36:22.054 --> 36:24.557
As a thought exercise.

36:26.142 --> 36:27.101
It's illegal.

36:28.436 --> 36:32.440
Self-defense is the only legal foundation
for a British attack.

36:33.858 --> 36:36.611
What if we could defend

36:37.445 --> 36:40.573
against an imminent
Lenkov Group attack somewhere.

36:43.201 --> 36:44.035
Defend.

36:45.995 --> 36:49.290
Lenkov troops are
raping their way through Libya.

36:51.042 --> 36:53.878
Trying to reopen a war
that the U.N. settled.

36:55.171 --> 36:58.007
And Libya has requested our help
more than once.

36:59.842 --> 37:01.260
Why don't we help them?

37:03.888 --> 37:07.516
A hit on Lenkov troops in Libya,
it's not revenge, it's...

37:08.893 --> 37:10.728
aiding Libyan self-defense.

37:11.312 --> 37:12.230
Legal.

37:13.397 --> 37:14.232
Lethal.

37:15.358 --> 37:17.401
Scratches the itch for Trowbridge.

37:21.072 --> 37:21.906
It might.

37:23.032 --> 37:25.493
<i>Does he like it?</i>
- Is he into it?

37:25.493 --> 37:30.081
I don't know, I can't tell his happy face
from his sad face.

37:30.081 --> 37:33.626
We can't put it on the table
with all of them there, so...

37:34.335 --> 37:37.171
you bring it to Ganon
and I'll bring it to Trowbridge.

37:38.047 --> 37:38.881
You're right.

37:40.007 --> 37:43.678
It's good. You found something
that's quite workable.

37:44.929 --> 37:45.888
We all did.

37:47.265 --> 37:48.975
Well, the concept was yours.

37:50.935 --> 37:53.354
It was Margaret Roylin's.

37:56.774 --> 37:58.109
That's where you were?

37:59.360 --> 38:01.445
- I know--
- I'm quite sure you don't.

38:06.325 --> 38:09.412
Do you or do you not
want the PM to buy this?

38:16.460 --> 38:19.797
The minute you leave the room,
he calls Roylin and she says, "Brilliant."

38:20.631 --> 38:21.632
And we're done.

38:26.429 --> 38:27.847
Ganon's through there.

38:32.184 --> 38:33.019
Take a second.

38:44.530 --> 38:47.074
Why is my office
getting calls about Libya?

38:47.783 --> 38:49.785
The ambassador had some questions.

38:49.785 --> 38:52.872
You said the ambassador
wasn't painting targets,

38:52.872 --> 38:54.749
she was doing some sort of mind-fuck,

38:54.749 --> 38:57.752
designed to make Trowbridge
buy a diplomatic plan.

38:58.294 --> 38:59.170
It's a good plan.

38:59.170 --> 39:03.174
It's so good he wants to attack
Russian fighters in Libya?

39:03.174 --> 39:06.677
Since when did you become
the brave defender of Russian mercenaries?

39:07.303 --> 39:09.138
We can't find the ball.

39:10.222 --> 39:11.057
Russia.

39:11.682 --> 39:13.934
We can't pinpoint who gave the order.

39:13.934 --> 39:16.979
It wasn't military intelligence.
It wasn't the FSB.

39:16.979 --> 39:21.275
Sources who should know where it came from
didn't even know it was happening.

39:22.151 --> 39:23.110
That's very bad.

39:23.110 --> 39:24.445
I get it.

39:24.445 --> 39:29.116
So how about we call the ambassador
and tell her to slow her roll.

39:29.992 --> 39:32.328
You want me to pull the rug out
from under her,

39:32.328 --> 39:35.039
because you can't pinpoint
which of the dozen guys

39:35.039 --> 39:37.666
in the Kremlin's inner circle
pressed "go"?

39:38.292 --> 39:41.253
If you wanna be
reductionist about it, yeah.

39:42.380 --> 39:46.092
She's in a room with the PM
and the secretaries,

39:46.092 --> 39:47.635
and she has a plan.

39:48.344 --> 39:52.932
Part of the reason it's working is because
they're all in there staring at each other

39:52.932 --> 39:55.101
and Ganon really wants to leave.

39:55.101 --> 39:59.522
So if we stop her because
the intelligence isn't all there yet,

39:59.522 --> 40:00.856
we're gonna lose our shot.

40:00.856 --> 40:02.441
"Isn't all there"?

40:02.441 --> 40:04.944
If the intelligence changes,
we'll change the plan.

40:04.944 --> 40:06.862
- Like we did in Iraq?
- Come on.

40:06.862 --> 40:09.240
We leveled the country
before we changed that plan.

40:09.240 --> 40:12.326
We are gonna push the Lenkov Group
out of Libya.

40:14.078 --> 40:15.287
It's good news.

40:25.131 --> 40:25.965
So?

40:27.216 --> 40:28.050
He bought it.

40:28.801 --> 40:31.804
- I can't believe it. It actually worked.
- It didn't.

40:32.471 --> 40:33.431
Ganon said no.

40:34.098 --> 40:36.016
But it's a rock-solid plan.

40:37.435 --> 40:38.269
A flat no.

40:38.853 --> 40:41.355
Won't even run it up the flagpole.

40:41.355 --> 40:43.816
That makes no sense. None.

40:46.902 --> 40:47.987
I'm in the car.

40:47.987 --> 40:50.823
Can you find out
where Ganon flew in from this morning?

40:50.823 --> 40:51.866
D.C.

40:51.866 --> 40:55.327
No, it wasn't D.C.
But State's not gonna tell you that.

40:55.327 --> 40:57.079
How would you suggest I find out

40:57.079 --> 40:59.707
if the secretary made a secret side trip
on his way over here?

40:59.707 --> 41:02.168
I don't know, ask your CIA girlfriend.

41:12.094 --> 41:15.598
If I met him at the airport
like a good girl,

41:15.598 --> 41:17.892
- would he have given it a chance?
- No.

41:19.185 --> 41:20.603
Did you say something to him?

41:20.603 --> 41:22.521
- About what?
- Anything.

41:22.521 --> 41:25.483
He was in a pissed off mood
from the get-go.

41:26.484 --> 41:27.693
He's got a rash.

41:29.069 --> 41:30.571
Did you comment on it?

41:31.447 --> 41:34.033
Uh, yeah, I saw the bumps on his back,

41:34.033 --> 41:37.244
and I said, "Mr. Secretary,
what the oozing fuck is that?"

41:37.244 --> 41:39.038
I went at him too hard.

41:39.705 --> 41:41.040
Jesus Christ. Come on.

41:41.707 --> 41:42.917
He was ready to hate me.

41:42.917 --> 41:46.295
He hates you,
and he thinks I'm your meat puppet.

41:48.130 --> 41:53.302
Kate, he made a pitstop in South Carolina
on the way here

41:53.302 --> 41:55.471
to receive an honorary doctorate.

41:59.683 --> 42:01.143
In South Carolina?

42:02.269 --> 42:07.566
So maybe he didn't like the plan because
he doesn't want Rayburn to succeed.

42:09.443 --> 42:11.111
Ganon wants to be president.

42:11.612 --> 42:12.988
He's a great candidate.

42:13.489 --> 42:14.657
He's experienced.

42:15.616 --> 42:17.868
But you don't win
against a sitting president

42:17.868 --> 42:21.288
who just brokered
a Persian-Gulf-Russia-Libya hat trick.

42:22.414 --> 42:23.374
Wow.

42:24.708 --> 42:25.543
Is that it?

42:26.794 --> 42:28.504
- What?
-"Wow"?

42:29.296 --> 42:31.715
I'm speechless. I thought you liked
when that happened.

42:31.715 --> 42:35.135
Do you, or do you not
want to be considered

42:35.135 --> 42:38.472
- for vice president of the United States?
- Fuck's sake.

42:38.472 --> 42:41.850
- Look, you haven't said yes yet, right?
- I haven't.

42:41.850 --> 42:44.061
And you haven't said no
definitively to Billie.

42:44.061 --> 42:45.271
- Have you?
- No.

42:46.272 --> 42:48.399
That means Billie wants to make you happy.

42:48.399 --> 42:50.568
And the president wants to make you happy.

42:50.568 --> 42:55.030
That means right now is the one time
when you get to break shit.

42:58.701 --> 43:00.661
What is it that you think I should break?

43:01.870 --> 43:03.247
The secretary of state.

43:03.872 --> 43:04.707
God.

43:07.209 --> 43:08.127
Do you see...

43:09.336 --> 43:11.380
that every time
you're backed into a corner,

43:11.380 --> 43:13.173
or I am backed into a corner,

43:13.924 --> 43:17.761
your best idea is to cut the legs off
one of your colleagues?

43:18.512 --> 43:21.807
You've left a bloody swath
across all of Washington.

43:21.807 --> 43:23.601
Why does Ganon have to like you?

43:23.601 --> 43:26.729
Because people do things
for people they like.

43:26.729 --> 43:30.149
We exist in a marketplace of favors.

43:31.191 --> 43:33.986
That has lubricated your journey
through the world.

43:33.986 --> 43:36.322
So Stuart will lubricate.

43:36.905 --> 43:38.907
That's not your job anymore. It's his.

43:38.907 --> 43:41.285
I didn't do any of that
because you did it for me.

43:41.285 --> 43:43.370
I was doing something else, right?

43:43.370 --> 43:45.706
If everybody hates you, it all stops.

43:46.790 --> 43:47.833
- Does it?
- Yeah.

43:49.543 --> 43:50.836
Well, you hate me.

43:51.420 --> 43:53.213
I'm still sitting on your bed.

44:03.724 --> 44:04.642
How's it going?

44:04.642 --> 44:05.559
Not great.

44:06.644 --> 44:08.896
The secretary of state
wants to kill the plan.

44:08.896 --> 44:10.397
I'm sorry.

44:10.397 --> 44:11.440
<i>No, you're not.</i>

44:12.024 --> 44:12.858
I'm not?

44:12.858 --> 44:15.736
No. You didn't like the plan
in the first place.

44:15.736 --> 44:19.615
I don't like sending a plan up the chain
before we have intelligence to support it.

44:19.615 --> 44:21.867
<i>- It's actually a great plan.</i>
- Mm-hm.

44:23.535 --> 44:25.162
The husband knows about us.

44:26.538 --> 44:27.539
Wyler's husband?

44:27.539 --> 44:29.291
He called you my girlfriend.

44:31.669 --> 44:32.795
Does the wife know?

44:32.795 --> 44:33.837
I don't know.

44:34.505 --> 44:37.257
But our hands
are kind of being forced here.

44:39.093 --> 44:41.887
-<i>And I'm okay with it.</i>
- What are you saying?

44:41.887 --> 44:43.847
Maybe we go public.

44:43.847 --> 44:47.643
Because you wanna go public,
or because somebody figured it out?

44:48.227 --> 44:49.311
How's about both?

44:54.024 --> 44:56.110
That's some really moving assent.

44:57.736 --> 45:00.823
Dating a station chief's a hotshot move.
It makes you look good.

45:00.823 --> 45:03.826
- I'm okay with that.
- Makes me look like a fucking girlfriend.

45:03.826 --> 45:07.287
You're the one who wanted
to go to Cairo together. Openly.

45:07.287 --> 45:11.208
When you show up and
a relationship's in place, it's old news.

45:11.208 --> 45:14.253
Here, it'll make me look like
I haven't been doing my job,

45:14.253 --> 45:16.338
because I've been swooning over you.

45:16.338 --> 45:17.965
- You have.
<i>- I'm not--</i>

45:18.549 --> 45:21.009
You know what, whatever. I gotta go.

45:35.607 --> 45:36.483
Hi.

45:36.483 --> 45:38.110
Should we try that again?

45:38.110 --> 45:39.027
Yeah.

45:40.821 --> 45:45.117
Do you want
to be in a public relationship with me?

45:46.869 --> 45:47.703
Yes.

45:49.538 --> 45:50.372
Yeah, me too.

45:54.334 --> 45:55.294
I did something.

45:56.420 --> 45:57.838
- Again?
- Thanks.

45:59.882 --> 46:01.133
Will it work?

46:01.842 --> 46:03.427
I don't think so.

46:03.927 --> 46:06.138
If it worked,
Ganon would've gotten a phone call,

46:06.138 --> 46:08.015
and he'd be really pissed off.

46:09.808 --> 46:12.227
I think it's gonna get me fired.

46:14.354 --> 46:15.189
Unfortunate.

46:16.815 --> 46:19.026
Life will be simpler here without me.

46:22.237 --> 46:23.071
It will.

46:29.203 --> 46:30.579
Okay. How did you know?

46:31.872 --> 46:34.917
- About Ganon?
- About me and the station chief.

46:36.043 --> 46:36.877
I didn't.

46:37.461 --> 46:38.754
Wait, you said--

46:38.754 --> 46:39.880
I said.

46:40.547 --> 46:41.381
I didn't know.

46:42.090 --> 46:45.802
Then you left this long, dangling pause.
That's when I knew.

46:45.802 --> 46:47.179
Ah.

46:47.930 --> 46:51.058
I thought it might be fitting
if you said a few words to open.

46:51.058 --> 46:52.935
I shouldn't be making a toast.

46:52.935 --> 46:56.146
I'm the stray dog who turned up
on the back steps and wouldn't leave.

46:57.064 --> 47:01.610
Don't you got any remarks, welcoming us to
your humble monument to colonial plunder?

47:02.611 --> 47:05.989
I think I'll wait
until you're all thoroughly lacquered.

47:05.989 --> 47:06.907
Smart man.

47:07.658 --> 47:10.494
There's an Arab proverb
that goes something like,

47:11.119 --> 47:13.956
"It's good to know the truth and speak it.

47:13.956 --> 47:18.043
It's better to know the truth
and speak of palm trees."

47:19.836 --> 47:22.422
All of which is to say,
love what you did with the plants.

47:32.849 --> 47:33.976
Excuse me.

47:46.238 --> 47:50.075
Ladies and gentlemen,
the Libya plan is in motion.

47:50.075 --> 47:52.327
Please cancel your dinner plans.

47:52.327 --> 47:56.039
The document you got five minutes ago
is out of date,

47:56.039 --> 47:58.458
someone got a little too eager
with the send button.

47:58.458 --> 47:59.960
A new one is on its way.

48:00.836 --> 48:03.422
I would love a map of Libya
from this millennium,

48:03.422 --> 48:06.174
I believe I'm looking at one
from the last millennium.

48:06.174 --> 48:08.051
Of all the reasonable options,

48:08.051 --> 48:10.345
that is what
the president of the United States

48:10.345 --> 48:12.681
has decided we should be doing.

48:13.348 --> 48:16.893
Marching into Libya
as if we didn't learn our lesson in Iraq.

48:17.436 --> 48:18.979
And in Afghanistan.

48:18.979 --> 48:22.691
And, now that I think about it,
in Libya...

48:22.691 --> 48:24.735
I feel like we should rescue him.

48:25.485 --> 48:26.570
- Stuart?
- Yeah.

48:26.570 --> 48:29.281
- over, and expecting different results...
That's the job.

48:29.948 --> 48:32.451
You did it for years.
Not your job anymore.

48:33.702 --> 48:34.536
Yeah.

48:35.787 --> 48:36.955
This job is better.

48:39.833 --> 48:42.210
- Is it?
- On a day like today, yeah.

48:42.210 --> 48:45.213
- It's like a fucking drug, isn't it?
- Settle down.

48:49.635 --> 48:50.969
I was a little shitty.

48:51.887 --> 48:55.223
About the idea of you playing number two,

48:55.223 --> 48:58.477
without eating up
all the oxygen in the room.

48:58.477 --> 49:00.771
You weren't shitty. You were dubious.

49:01.688 --> 49:02.856
With reason.

49:03.565 --> 49:05.776
But... I did it.

49:06.568 --> 49:07.527
Didn't I?

49:11.114 --> 49:12.866
Oh, boy, that was an earful.

49:15.410 --> 49:16.620
Is he gonna be okay?

49:17.454 --> 49:18.288
Fuck him.

49:18.789 --> 49:22.793
You brought the Western alliance
back from the brink of war with Russia.

49:22.793 --> 49:25.712
- Whoa, grandiose.
- Accurate.

49:25.712 --> 49:26.630
Accurate.

49:28.006 --> 49:30.384
You know who has days like this
all the time?

49:30.384 --> 49:31.301
Stop.

49:31.843 --> 49:33.136
- The vice president.
- Okay.

49:33.136 --> 49:35.847
Plenty of vice presidents do nothing ever.

49:35.847 --> 49:37.140
Plenty do a lot.

49:37.140 --> 49:41.561
You can do more in an afternoon
than most people accomplish in a lifetime.

49:41.561 --> 49:42.979
Just think about that.

49:44.189 --> 49:45.691
I think she's thinking about it.

49:45.691 --> 49:46.692
Really?

49:47.818 --> 49:50.320
Ma'am, do you wanna be vice president?

49:52.322 --> 49:53.407
You hear that?

49:55.033 --> 49:58.537
That was... a long pause.

49:58.537 --> 50:00.122
It was a long pause.

50:00.122 --> 50:04.876
A long, dangling, eloquent pause.

50:04.876 --> 50:06.920
All right, go have another drink.

50:13.760 --> 50:15.762
- Careful.
- Or what?

50:16.680 --> 50:18.181
They're not divorced yet.

50:19.099 --> 50:21.977
I wasn't aware
they were getting a divorce. Are they?

50:23.353 --> 50:24.896
Confidentially, yeah.

50:27.149 --> 50:28.692
I should congratulate her.

50:34.573 --> 50:37.534
- They're eager to read your report.
- I could brief.

50:38.452 --> 50:40.704
I'm not qualified to write the report.

50:42.497 --> 50:44.166
- But perhaps you could--
- No.

50:45.208 --> 50:46.209
- But if you--
- No.

50:46.960 --> 50:49.171
- Okay.
Sorry. Excuse me, darling.

50:51.840 --> 50:53.258
Are you quite all right?

50:56.762 --> 50:58.388
I'm dating someone at work.

50:58.388 --> 51:00.265
Oh, how lovely.

51:00.265 --> 51:04.561
And we're going public,
and you're the first person I've told.

51:04.561 --> 51:05.520
Oh.

51:06.271 --> 51:07.230
Oh, I'm honored.

51:07.898 --> 51:08.732
Who is it?

51:09.566 --> 51:11.109
I can't tell you.

51:11.985 --> 51:14.905
- Why not?
- Can't tell you that, either.

51:14.905 --> 51:16.740
Oh. Is it CIA?

51:16.740 --> 51:19.910
- What?
- I know. It can't be easy, dating CIA.

51:19.910 --> 51:21.578
I... It's...

51:22.996 --> 51:26.958
The messaging could use some work,
but congratulations all the same.

51:28.919 --> 51:30.253
It's a gift, isn't it?

51:31.254 --> 51:34.007
Passion for work, passion for each other,

51:34.007 --> 51:37.469
all whirled up like some lusty tornado.

51:38.136 --> 51:40.305
Some people never have anything like it.

51:41.640 --> 51:42.641
Give him a turn.

51:42.641 --> 51:43.642
Yes, okay.

51:45.143 --> 51:47.395
- It's better than one, isn't it?
- What?

51:49.648 --> 51:50.482
Two.
