00:29.460 --> 00:32.414
Junior, this is kind
of a sentimental moment.

00:32.588 --> 00:35.459
Cold River is where
I was born and raised.

00:35.633 --> 00:37.922
Everyone I know is here.

00:38.094 --> 00:40.420
Got fond memories of this place.

00:40.597 --> 00:43.088
Fond memories? What
are you talking about?

00:43.266 --> 00:46.718
Everybody hated you.
Your father, your wife,

00:46.895 --> 00:49.469
those horrible neighbours...

00:50.399 --> 00:52.475
You're right. Let's blow this joint!

00:54.320 --> 00:56.859
Yah! Whoo-ha!

01:02.288 --> 01:05.491
<i>When the pressure's
on and you're all alone</i>

01:07.251 --> 01:10.336
<i>Take a little ride into the danger zone</i>

01:11.673 --> 01:14.543
<i>When the moon is high
And the skies are clear</i>

01:16.261 --> 01:19.381
<i>Just show me a sign
and we'll be outta here</i>

01:19.556 --> 01:23.471
<i>Take me up on a wing and a prayer...</i>

01:23.686 --> 01:25.263
Look.

01:25.437 --> 01:29.518
<i>If you need a friend,
you know... I'll be there</i>

01:32.862 --> 01:35.270
<i>Hound dogs howlin' all through the night</i>

01:37.492 --> 01:40.197
<i>Eight miles high and I'm doin' all right</i>

01:42.289 --> 01:45.076
<i>Better move over 'Cause
you're goin' too slow</i>

01:46.793 --> 01:49.749
<i>I feel the need for
freedom Now it's time to go</i>

01:49.923 --> 01:53.090
<i>It's a fine line
between pleasure and pain</i>

01:55.095 --> 01:59.971
<i>Let your conscience be your
guide Till we meet again</i>

02:01.310 --> 02:04.975
<i>Your time has come You
can stand or you can run</i>

02:06.274 --> 02:09.477
<i>But don't keep it all inside</i>

02:10.277 --> 02:14.821
<i>'Cause you gotta understand
That there ain't no second chance</i>

02:15.367 --> 02:19.863
<i>No one gets outta here alive
Only the strong survive...</i>

02:35.722 --> 02:37.631
We're finally here.

02:38.601 --> 02:42.848
<i>Take me up on a wing and a prayer</i>

02:43.981 --> 02:49.736
<i>If you need someone,
you know... I'll be there</i>

02:49.904 --> 02:54.282
<i>Your time has come You
can stand or you can run</i>

02:55.744 --> 02:58.615
<i>But don't keep it all inside</i>

02:58.789 --> 03:03.451
<i>'Cause you gotta understand
That there ain't no second chance</i>

03:03.627 --> 03:08.871
<i>No one gets outta here alive
Only the strong survive...</i>

03:13.012 --> 03:15.136
<i>Only the strong survive...</i>

03:15.307 --> 03:17.976
- Is it the one with the yellow roof?
- No.

03:19.811 --> 03:23.892
- Is it the one with the purple flowers?
- No.

03:24.066 --> 03:26.771
The one with the
"Sold" sign in the yard?

03:26.944 --> 03:28.604
Bingo!

03:28.779 --> 03:31.568
<i>Only the strong survive</i>

03:35.162 --> 03:37.618
Dad, come on. Let's go. Quick!

03:41.043 --> 03:43.535
Oh, my God!

03:43.713 --> 03:46.548
- Look at that hunk.
- Hubba hubba.

03:47.592 --> 03:50.961
And the realtor says he's single.

03:51.137 --> 03:53.130
Single?!

03:53.306 --> 03:55.383
- What do you think, Junior?
- Great.

03:55.559 --> 03:58.015
Come on! Quick, Dad!

03:58.187 --> 04:02.232
Whoa! Totally awesome!

04:02.399 --> 04:05.235
- Radical!
- You like it?

04:05.403 --> 04:08.606
Wow! It's fantastic!

04:08.781 --> 04:11.189
Wait till you see your bedroom.

04:12.035 --> 04:13.410
Yee-ha!

04:13.578 --> 04:16.994
- Home, sweet home!
- Yeah, that's right!

04:18.208 --> 04:19.952
This place is gigantic.

04:20.127 --> 04:22.749
You could play football in here.

04:22.922 --> 04:25.460
- Hit me, I'm open.
- Here's the bomb. OK...

04:25.634 --> 04:28.718
<i>So here we are, starting our new life.</i>

04:28.887 --> 04:31.461
<i>It's nice having a guy who loves me.</i>

04:31.640 --> 04:35.638
<i>Usually, people take one look
and run screaming for the hills.</i>

04:35.811 --> 04:41.150
<i>You know, I think me and Dad
are gonna do all right together.</i>

04:41.317 --> 04:44.104
Should I spike you? No,
it's illegal to spike kids.

04:44.278 --> 04:46.355
Come here, buddy. It's
just you and me, Junior.

04:47.782 --> 04:49.858
Hang on a second.
Somebody's at the door.

04:51.995 --> 04:54.866
Hi, I wanted to welcome you
to our little neighbourhood

04:55.040 --> 04:57.116
so I baked you a...

04:57.292 --> 04:59.997
...cherry pie.

05:00.170 --> 05:04.168
That's so sweet. Look, Junior.
She baked us a cherry pie.

05:04.342 --> 05:06.714
How thoughtful.

05:07.887 --> 05:10.592
All right! First and ten!

05:11.307 --> 05:13.384
Junior! What are you doing?

05:13.561 --> 05:16.645
I want you to apologise
to this kind lady.

05:18.357 --> 05:21.643
Oh! You're even
better-looking up close.

05:22.695 --> 05:24.071
Excuse me.

05:28.785 --> 05:30.363
What?!

05:33.207 --> 05:35.745
- Dad, what about football?
- Thank you.

05:35.918 --> 05:39.583
We can play later. Don't you want
to meet these wonderful ladies?

05:39.755 --> 05:43.089
Out of the way, girls!
Oh, thank God! Another man!

05:43.259 --> 05:46.628
Another Joe I can talk to.

05:46.804 --> 05:48.762
I'm going crazy living here.

05:48.932 --> 05:53.179
You know, Mortville. The
divorcee capital of the world.

05:53.353 --> 05:58.265
Anyway, we're having a barbecue. So I thought
I'd be neighbourly and invite you over.

05:58.442 --> 06:01.728
I'm Aron Burger, I live next door.

06:01.904 --> 06:05.820
My name is Ben Healy and
this is my son, Junior.

06:07.744 --> 06:11.410
Funny-looking kid. Anyway,
we'll take this with us.

06:11.582 --> 06:14.868
Well, neighbour, what do
you think of my cooker?

06:15.044 --> 06:18.247
- Very... large.
- You bet.

06:18.423 --> 06:22.171
Cost me a whole month's
paycheck, but it's worth it.

06:23.553 --> 06:26.839
You're not impressed. I guess
your wife does the cooking.

06:27.015 --> 06:29.257
No, I'm... not married, actually.

06:29.434 --> 06:31.308
We... broke up.

06:31.478 --> 06:34.728
And you got the kid? Bad deal!

06:34.898 --> 06:37.105
Did you get screwed!

06:37.276 --> 06:39.945
This neighbourhood has a move-in fee.

06:40.112 --> 06:43.030
You have to give each of us ten dollars.

06:43.199 --> 06:47.660
20 bucks?! I'm not
giving you diddly-squat.

06:47.829 --> 06:50.664
Pay us or leave!

06:50.832 --> 06:56.836
And with a 50-1 chick to stud ratio
in this town, you gotta get started.

06:57.006 --> 07:00.376
Dad, can we go? These
people are real dicks.

07:00.552 --> 07:04.419
Well, excuse me, Your Highness.

07:04.598 --> 07:08.643
I didn't realise that simple little
me and my simple little family

07:08.811 --> 07:12.227
weren't good enough for
your high and mighty tastes.

07:12.398 --> 07:17.025
Hey, I should go and
slip on my silk tuxedo

07:17.195 --> 07:22.355
<i>and then we can trot out the
champagne and the escargots.</i>

07:22.534 --> 07:26.069
Junior. Try to be
polite. We're his guests.

07:26.246 --> 07:27.657
OK, Dad.

07:27.831 --> 07:31.247
- I'm sorry about that.
- It's all right.

07:31.418 --> 07:34.253
We've taken a long trip and
he's just a little tired.

07:34.421 --> 07:37.588
My girls are the same way. Brats.

07:44.140 --> 07:46.216
Healy, go make yourself useful.

07:46.392 --> 07:49.015
Get some more barbecue
sauce from the little woman.

07:49.188 --> 07:52.142
Barbecue sauce. Sure thing, neighbour.

07:56.821 --> 08:00.237
Here's to the start of a beautiful meal.

08:06.164 --> 08:07.873
Damn.

08:13.464 --> 08:15.540
This one's not getting away.

08:18.553 --> 08:20.130
Gotcha!

08:48.794 --> 08:51.582
- My first day of school.
- I'm so proud of you.

08:51.756 --> 08:53.795
You're such a good girl.

08:54.842 --> 08:58.294
Junior, get out of this
car. You are going to school!

08:58.471 --> 09:00.594
No way! I'd rather eat a turd.

09:02.100 --> 09:03.476
Junior,

09:03.643 --> 09:07.593
third grade is the foundation
of a great education.

09:07.773 --> 09:10.774
If you don't go, you'll
only hurt yourself.

09:10.943 --> 09:13.315
I'll take a couple others down with me.

09:13.487 --> 09:15.112
Junior,

09:15.281 --> 09:18.946
I am your father and you'll do as I say!

09:19.118 --> 09:20.992
Now, come on.

09:26.293 --> 09:28.250
Now look what you've done.

09:31.507 --> 09:33.299
Get over here.

09:33.468 --> 09:37.217
Take this. Goodbye and good luck.

09:47.399 --> 09:50.436
It's his first day,
he's a little nervous.

09:58.620 --> 09:59.995
It's him.

10:03.125 --> 10:06.660
Yes, changing careers was
the smartest thing I ever did.

10:06.837 --> 10:10.288
Yes, oh, yeah! Because I
love being the principal.

10:10.466 --> 10:13.383
Because I hate children. I hate them.

10:13.552 --> 10:16.008
Being a principal's great,
'cause I hate children.

10:16.180 --> 10:18.256
I bark, they do what I say.

10:18.433 --> 10:21.138
Anything. Crawl around on
all fours. They do that.

10:21.311 --> 10:25.096
Would you mind jumping out
of the window? OK, sure.

10:25.274 --> 10:27.148
<i>Out they go. Anything.</i>

10:27.318 --> 10:30.770
<i>Principal Peabody, there's
a new student to see you.</i>

10:30.947 --> 10:33.438
I'll have to call you back.

10:33.616 --> 10:37.994
I have to deal with one of
the little weenies right now.

10:38.163 --> 10:40.405
OK, call you back.

10:40.582 --> 10:43.998
Send the little sweetheart in.

10:52.345 --> 10:55.512
Hey, pea-brain. What
are you doing here?

10:55.682 --> 10:58.054
What am I doing here?
What are you doing here?

10:58.226 --> 11:01.761
I belong here. You belong in Cold River.

11:01.938 --> 11:04.726
This is Mortville.
What are you doing here?

11:04.900 --> 11:08.898
You're not here. That's it. That's
the only answer. You're not here.

11:09.071 --> 11:13.318
You're not here. I'm imagining you.
You're a figment of my imagination.

11:13.492 --> 11:18.156
If I was a figment of your
imagination, could I do this?

11:18.332 --> 11:21.119
Oh!

11:22.878 --> 11:25.714
Did something crawl in here and die?!

11:25.881 --> 11:28.799
You disgusting kid!

11:28.968 --> 11:32.218
You disgusting, flatulating kid!

11:32.388 --> 11:36.801
Whoa! I just had a new paint
job, too. This is horrible.

11:36.977 --> 11:39.183
- What grade are you in?
- Third.

11:39.354 --> 11:42.190
Third. That means you're
here for another four years.

11:42.357 --> 11:46.605
This is a mistake. This is a big
mistake, 'cause you are a genius.

11:46.779 --> 11:48.985
You are so intelligent.

11:49.156 --> 11:52.111
Anyone who can break wind
like that has to have a mind.

11:52.285 --> 11:55.037
So I'm gonna pass you
on to the sixth grade.

11:55.204 --> 11:57.992
In one year, you're gonna
be in another school.

11:58.166 --> 12:02.544
My dad says third grade is
the foundation of my education.

12:02.712 --> 12:06.628
Your dad says that. Your dad is a moron!

12:06.801 --> 12:08.260
He's a moron!

12:08.428 --> 12:11.382
Know what a moron is?
That's what your dad is.

12:11.556 --> 12:15.934
Anyway, you don't belong here.
You belong in the sixth grade.

12:16.103 --> 12:18.724
That's where you are,
because you're a genius, kid.

12:18.897 --> 12:20.605
A genius.

12:24.028 --> 12:26.982
<i>Sixth grade? I Wowl</i>

12:27.156 --> 12:30.656
<i>I should fart in more people's offices.</i>

12:42.422 --> 12:46.373
Oh, no, not another one. How many
kids are they gonna make me teach?

12:47.970 --> 12:50.971
Get in there and find a
seat. Hustle, small fry.

12:51.140 --> 12:55.008
I'm not gonna have you hold
up my class all year. Move it.

12:55.186 --> 12:57.394
Let's start with a nice easy review

12:57.565 --> 13:01.479
to see how much you under-achievers
remember from last year.

13:01.652 --> 13:03.526
Polly, what's 17 times 8?

13:03.696 --> 13:06.270
- 136.
- Good.

13:06.449 --> 13:09.699
Richard, what's 72
divided by negative 9?

13:09.869 --> 13:11.827
- Negative 8, sir.
- Fine.

13:11.997 --> 13:13.621
Murph.

13:14.750 --> 13:17.157
Murph. What's three plus two?

13:20.756 --> 13:22.131
Four.

13:25.261 --> 13:27.633
You've been in the sixth
grade since I started here.

13:27.805 --> 13:30.806
I really want to get you out this year.

13:30.975 --> 13:34.925
Please work with me.
What's three plus two?

13:36.064 --> 13:37.606
Nine?

13:40.027 --> 13:42.233
This is gonna be a long year.

13:42.404 --> 13:44.231
Five, all right? The answer's five.

13:44.406 --> 13:45.817
You!

13:46.742 --> 13:49.578
- What are you saying?
- I said five.

13:52.082 --> 13:55.498
I'm glad somebody's paying attention.
Polly, pass out the workbooks.

13:55.669 --> 14:00.581
I'm gonna rummage in the storage closet,
see if I can find something for Murph.

14:19.403 --> 14:22.321
Who let the baby into the sixth grade?

14:23.991 --> 14:25.450
What's in your bag?

14:26.536 --> 14:29.620
- Your diapers? - No,
my lunch, pin- head.

14:33.042 --> 14:35.878
Little kid doesn't know
who he's talking to.

14:36.046 --> 14:37.955
I'm senior student in this school.

14:38.131 --> 14:41.133
No shit, you've been here since 1970.

14:41.302 --> 14:43.544
Oh, you're gonna hurt!

14:52.397 --> 14:54.639
This is your last day of school. Ever.

15:22.096 --> 15:26.841
<i>Maybe Dad's right. Maybe Mortville
is gonna be a great place to live.</i>

15:48.250 --> 15:49.625
Good morning, Miss Dumore.

15:49.793 --> 15:52.415
They missed a payment?
Toss 'em in the street.

15:52.588 --> 15:55.672
But, ma'am, that's a nursing
home. They're invalids.

15:55.841 --> 15:57.964
Oh,
boo-hoo-hoo.

15:58.135 --> 16:00.805
Are we all set for that charity ball?

16:00.972 --> 16:05.966
Your tickets are confirmed, but Sergio
says he needs money for a new tux.

16:06.144 --> 16:07.935
More money?

16:08.104 --> 16:11.308
I gave him two grand yesterday.

16:11.483 --> 16:13.725
These damned gigolos.

16:13.902 --> 16:16.607
Every man in Mortville
wants to bleed me dry.

16:16.780 --> 16:21.074
Why can't I just find
a good, decent man?

16:21.243 --> 16:25.741
One with integrity, one
with compassion, one with...

16:25.916 --> 16:29.119
Oh, my God! Who's that beefcake?

16:29.294 --> 16:31.833
I'm Ben Healy, we spoke on the phone.

16:32.006 --> 16:35.042
I don't know. I suppose
he's a customer at the bank.

16:35.217 --> 16:37.376
Out of my way, fat boy.

16:37.553 --> 16:42.892
That's why I wanna start my own business.
I wanna create something out of nothing.

16:43.059 --> 16:45.467
I don't just wanna take. I wanna give.

16:45.645 --> 16:48.563
I wanna put something
back into the community.

16:51.485 --> 16:54.652
He's incredible. And he's just my type.

16:54.822 --> 16:58.191
Smith, I want you to find
out everything about this guy.

16:58.367 --> 17:01.950
Because I think I've found
myself hubby number seven!

17:11.006 --> 17:13.840
Hi.

17:20.976 --> 17:23.300
- Hey, Junior!
- Hey, Dad!

17:23.478 --> 17:26.266
So, tell me, how was
your first day at school?

17:26.440 --> 17:28.978
Pretty good, they
skipped me three grades.

17:29.151 --> 17:33.612
They skipped you? That's
fantastic! I can't believe it!

17:33.781 --> 17:36.189
I told you you'd hit if off here.

17:36.367 --> 17:39.736
So, tell me. Did you
make any new friends?

17:39.912 --> 17:44.409
Well, how would you
define the word "friend"?

17:47.087 --> 17:50.290
- Aah!
- Uh!

17:50.465 --> 17:52.542
Ow.

18:01.561 --> 18:03.103
Who are you?

18:03.271 --> 18:07.483
I'm Annie Young. I'm the nurse
here at Mortville Elementary.

18:08.360 --> 18:11.730
The children are very lucky.

18:16.995 --> 18:18.869
- I'm sorry. Let me...
- It's OK.

18:19.038 --> 18:21.197
Oh, God. Excuse me. Here, I'll get...

18:22.501 --> 18:26.581
If you two are done fooling
around, maybe we can go home?

18:26.755 --> 18:28.463
Yeah...

18:28.632 --> 18:33.674
Give me a few minutes, Junior. I
think the swelling's coming back.

18:35.765 --> 18:37.971
I'll put a warm compress on that.

18:38.142 --> 18:40.301
You're such a good little soldier.

18:43.440 --> 18:46.856
"Give me a few minutes, Junior."
"Give me a few minutes, Junior."

18:47.027 --> 18:49.862
I've been here for an hour!

18:50.030 --> 18:52.568
Who does that nurse think she is?

18:52.783 --> 18:55.701
Mm...

18:55.869 --> 18:58.325
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

18:58.498 --> 19:00.740
Oh, it's you. Buzz off.

19:00.917 --> 19:04.287
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

19:05.047 --> 19:09.958
If I were you, I wouldn't do a lot
of things. Like go out in public.

19:18.561 --> 19:21.847
Next time, you'll listen to me.

19:29.656 --> 19:32.148
Oh, my God, he's an Adonis!

19:32.326 --> 19:34.235
Look at these stats!

19:34.412 --> 19:36.155
Six feet tall.

19:36.330 --> 19:38.656
185 pounds.

19:38.833 --> 19:42.961
In-seam, 35 inches.
Sweet Jesus, take me home!

19:46.800 --> 19:48.294
What's this thing?

19:48.468 --> 19:50.047
His son.

19:52.432 --> 19:55.883
"Boy and convicted
killer go on joyride"?

19:56.811 --> 20:00.430
"Little league team hospitalised"?

20:00.941 --> 20:04.642
"Union Carbide plant explodes"?

20:05.696 --> 20:07.356
This kid's a nightmare.

20:07.531 --> 20:09.987
Do you want to forget the whole thing?

20:10.159 --> 20:12.068
Smith...

20:12.745 --> 20:14.904
When someone has a bum leg,

20:15.081 --> 20:17.537
you don't shoot the patient.

20:17.709 --> 20:20.378
You just cut off the leg.

20:22.839 --> 20:28.296
<i>That's why you want a franchise. Big Ben is the fastest
- growing sports equipment empire.</i>

20:28.470 --> 20:30.463
Hey, it's Big Ben.

20:30.639 --> 20:32.596
<i>Pick up that phone and call now.</i>

20:32.766 --> 20:36.183
<i>For just $399, you can
get one of my starter kits.</i>

20:36.354 --> 20:40.932
<i>Then you'll be on your way to having
it all, just like me, Big Ben Healy.</i>

20:41.109 --> 20:43.316
What's this?

20:44.488 --> 20:48.949
Look at this. What sort of
idiot would send Grandpa money?

20:49.118 --> 20:51.111
<i>That's my namel</i>

20:51.287 --> 20:54.372
- The old man's finally
lost his mind. - Uh-huh.

20:54.791 --> 20:58.919
- Come downstairs. I got a surprise for you.
- All right! A surprise?

20:59.087 --> 21:00.795
- Where is it?
- Down the steps.

21:00.964 --> 21:03.669
Now, where is that surprise?

21:03.842 --> 21:06.049
- Surprise!
- Hi, Junior!

21:06.220 --> 21:10.467
I'm Rhoda, your babysitter.
We're gonna be good friends.

21:10.641 --> 21:13.393
Dad, let's slow this down a minute.

21:13.561 --> 21:15.767
Now, what is going on here?

21:15.939 --> 21:19.355
This is Rhoda, your babysitter.
You're gonna be good friends.

21:19.526 --> 21:22.859
Yeah, I heard that part. But why?

21:23.029 --> 21:24.987
Yoo-hoo!

21:25.157 --> 21:27.149
Because I'm going out on a date.

21:27.951 --> 21:30.027
Hi, Ben. I'm all ready.

21:30.204 --> 21:33.954
Great. Junior, you
remember Debbie Claukinski?

21:34.126 --> 21:37.958
How can I forget? Her
pie gave us the runs.

21:39.381 --> 21:43.462
That's not true. He's thinking
about someone else's pie.

21:43.636 --> 21:47.930
Anyway, we don't want to be late. I got
reservations at the Saint Pierre Club.

21:48.099 --> 21:53.224
Oh, I'm so excited! My ex-husband
never took me to fancy places.

21:53.396 --> 21:58.355
Not that I'm a gal who rattles on about her
last marriage. That guy is insanely jealous.

21:58.527 --> 22:01.018
Dad, stay here and have fun with me.

22:01.196 --> 22:03.272
Junior, you're gonna
have fun with Rhoda.

22:03.449 --> 22:08.526
I'm sure you can think of a lot of fun games
to play with her, OK? I'll talk to you later.

22:09.455 --> 22:12.824
<i>Welcome to the wonderful world of pigs.</i>

22:13.000 --> 22:16.204
<i>Dirty, hungry and always horny,</i>

22:16.379 --> 22:19.879
<i>they're Mother Nature's
clowns of the farm world.</i>

22:20.050 --> 22:23.585
<i>Watching these charming
critters roll in the mud,</i>

22:23.762 --> 22:28.057
<i>it's hard to believe they have an
intelligence as high as some humans.</i>

22:28.226 --> 22:30.302
<i>But it's true.</i>

22:31.771 --> 22:33.266
<i>Goodnight, Dad.</i>

22:33.440 --> 22:36.109
Hey, brat. Put that back. I'm watching.

22:41.699 --> 22:43.941
<i>This babysitter sucks.</i>

22:44.118 --> 22:47.072
<i>I gotta get Dad back on track here.</i>

22:48.289 --> 22:52.239
<i>I wonder whatever
happened to Mr Claukinski?</i>

23:03.764 --> 23:05.139
Hello?

23:05.307 --> 23:09.886
<i>Are you the guy that was
married to Debbie Claukinski?</i>

23:10.062 --> 23:12.636
Yeah, but then she left me.

23:13.900 --> 23:18.646
She took my house,
my money and my pride.

23:19.657 --> 23:23.702
<i>Well, I thought you'd like to know
that she found herself a new guy</i>

23:23.870 --> 23:29.326
<i>and they're out at the Saint Pierre
Club, having fun at your expense.</i>

23:29.501 --> 23:30.876
Who is this?

23:31.044 --> 23:33.998
<i>Just call me a friend.</i>

23:44.141 --> 23:45.968
Ben, this evening is perfect.

23:46.143 --> 23:50.224
<i>I know why the Mortville Gazette gave
this restaurant three and a half forks.</i>

23:51.107 --> 23:54.607
- Excuse me, we have a dress code.
- Let me in, you fool.

23:56.780 --> 23:58.903
To us.

23:59.074 --> 24:00.817
Tonight.

24:04.121 --> 24:06.279
Ah-ha!

24:06.457 --> 24:09.708
Debbie, you tramp!
What are you doing here?

24:09.878 --> 24:12.548
I'm a free woman. I can do what I want.

24:12.714 --> 24:14.339
I show you.

24:16.093 --> 24:19.961
Debbie, you leave with me.
Come, we take the bus home.

24:20.139 --> 24:22.891
Like hell I will. I'm on a date.

24:24.102 --> 24:27.435
You home-breaker!

24:30.525 --> 24:32.518
Oh, my kidney!

24:32.694 --> 24:34.853
You bully!

24:38.158 --> 24:40.863
Ben, shame on you!

24:42.371 --> 24:44.660
Laser cannon locked on.

24:45.708 --> 24:48.116
Fire laser cannon.

24:53.842 --> 24:56.511
Finally, Dad's home.

24:58.847 --> 25:02.134
<i>- I thought you'd never get here.
- Who's that weirdo?</i>

25:02.310 --> 25:06.688
- Gee, baby, you work fast.
- I got Russian hands and Roman fingers.

25:06.856 --> 25:09.312
Now where's that master bedroom?

25:09.484 --> 25:11.857
Here it is, darlin'!

25:13.447 --> 25:18.868
- This ain't no motel.
- Mind your own beeswax, twerp. Go watch TV.

25:19.036 --> 25:21.527
Yeah, what she said.

25:36.221 --> 25:38.973
Voytek, you were always the best.

25:39.141 --> 25:40.683
Yeah.

25:42.353 --> 25:44.642
So much for my first date.

25:48.359 --> 25:49.937
Now what?

25:50.111 --> 25:51.191
All right!

25:51.363 --> 25:54.115
Yeah... go!

25:56.702 --> 25:59.194
Yes! That's great!

25:59.372 --> 26:00.950
Look at that.

26:02.625 --> 26:05.461
I didn't think people could do that.

26:05.629 --> 26:08.120
She ain't no real blonde.

26:09.299 --> 26:11.588
Come on!

26:11.760 --> 26:14.845
Keep it up, my God!

26:19.059 --> 26:21.764
- He's still going!
- Unbelievable.

26:26.776 --> 26:28.354
Yeah, go for it!

26:28.528 --> 26:31.197
Healy, that's hot stuff.

26:34.576 --> 26:37.198
Junior, we're new
here in this community.

26:37.371 --> 26:40.491
Can't we at least attempt to fit in?

26:40.666 --> 26:44.499
Why are you getting angry at
me? I didn't do it, I watched it.

26:44.671 --> 26:47.423
Yes, and so did the
entire neighbourhood.

26:47.591 --> 26:49.500
I didn't hear any complaints.

26:51.637 --> 26:55.053
Great. The evening that wouldn't die.

26:55.975 --> 26:57.350
What?

26:58.770 --> 27:00.846
There's two more outside.

27:01.022 --> 27:04.937
- Dad, what are you doing here?
- I thought I'd spend my vacation with you.

27:05.110 --> 27:08.230
- Excuse me?
- How did he find us?

27:09.156 --> 27:11.943
You rascal. I even brought Nippy.

27:12.117 --> 27:15.321
Hey, boy. Come here, Nip.

27:15.496 --> 27:17.572
Get this freak off me! Get!

27:17.748 --> 27:22.245
Don't scare him, for God's sakes.
He's only trying to be friendly.

27:22.420 --> 27:25.706
- You know this dog is unbalanced.
- Get him out of here.

27:25.882 --> 27:27.673
Nippy, stay.

27:28.426 --> 27:30.051
What is going on here?

27:30.220 --> 27:35.013
You never take vacations, and if you
did you wouldn't spend them with me.

27:35.184 --> 27:36.976
Little Ben.

27:38.271 --> 27:41.189
Little Ben, you're my only son.

27:41.358 --> 27:45.438
- Dad, you hate me.
- OK, you figured me out.

27:45.612 --> 27:47.854
- I'm not on vacation, I'm broke.
- You're what?

27:48.031 --> 27:51.614
Chapter 11, my S and L crashed,
my creditors are after me.

27:51.785 --> 27:56.033
- I gotta find a place to hide out.
- Why don't you hide out somewhere else?

27:56.207 --> 27:59.658
Why don't you mind your own
business? Nobody asked you.

27:59.836 --> 28:02.753
Wait, you can't be
broke, we saw you on TV.

28:02.922 --> 28:06.588
That was a big rip-off.
There were no franchises.

28:06.760 --> 28:09.215
Hell, I only sold one starter kit.

28:09.388 --> 28:14.631
I gotta find a place to lay low until
this whole godforsaken thing blows over.

28:14.810 --> 28:18.144
Come on, Little Ben. Do
your old man a favour.

28:18.314 --> 28:21.517
All those years I spent
putting a roof over your head.

28:21.692 --> 28:25.560
I even bribed that dean to
keep you in college, remember?

28:25.738 --> 28:29.108
You know something? You owe me.

28:31.871 --> 28:34.196
This room is a little small.

28:34.373 --> 28:38.288
Well, it's all we've got. You
can sleep in one of the bunk-beds.

28:38.461 --> 28:39.955
Or you can leave.

28:40.130 --> 28:42.336
No, it'll do.

28:42.507 --> 28:44.833
But I get the top bunk.

29:39.110 --> 29:41.317
Finally!

30:05.805 --> 30:08.925
Some educators underestimate
the value of civics,

30:09.102 --> 30:11.390
but I say, for the growing mind,

30:11.562 --> 30:15.145
there's nothing more important
than pride in your city.

30:15.316 --> 30:18.401
This is Highway 39.

30:19.613 --> 30:21.985
This is the Mortville Steel Mill.

30:23.867 --> 30:28.161
And this is Mortville's
very own Love Rock.

30:28.330 --> 30:32.163
When the Dumore family settled this
region, they stole it from the Indians.

30:32.335 --> 30:35.502
The Indians claim the
rock has magic powers.

30:35.672 --> 30:37.249
What kind of magic?

30:37.423 --> 30:39.546
I don't know. Love magic, I guess.

30:39.718 --> 30:44.380
You make a wish and it comes true, at
least that's what they tell the tourists.

30:53.649 --> 30:55.689
Can I get a drink of water?

30:55.860 --> 30:57.734
Yes, you may, but hurry back.

30:57.904 --> 31:01.605
I've got a great slide of the
Rotary Club coming straight up.

31:33.734 --> 31:35.941
Hey, pumpkin-head.

31:36.112 --> 31:38.319
You're gonna wish you never said that.

31:38.490 --> 31:40.150
Oh, yeah?

31:48.792 --> 31:50.785
So, what exactly happened?

31:50.961 --> 31:52.955
I was using the fire hose.

31:53.131 --> 31:56.583
Aha. And why were you doing this?

31:56.760 --> 32:01.256
I told you, a fire had broken out
and I was trying to save the school.

32:02.975 --> 32:05.015
Junior, what happened?

32:05.186 --> 32:08.602
Your son saved the
school. He put out a fire.

32:10.191 --> 32:13.856
Did anyone ask him how
it started? Because...

32:16.072 --> 32:18.990
- I'm so sorry, that's very clumsy of me.
- That's OK.

32:19.868 --> 32:21.327
Listen...

32:22.329 --> 32:25.994
If Junior seems a little
troublesome lately,

32:26.166 --> 32:27.791
I wouldn't worry about it.

32:27.960 --> 32:32.587
He really hasn't made any friends here
yet so he's probably a little insecure.

32:33.466 --> 32:36.301
Boy, you really know kids.

32:38.012 --> 32:40.504
Junior and I were gonna get dinner later

32:40.682 --> 32:47.267
and I thought maybe if you didn't have
any plans that you'd... care to join us.

32:47.440 --> 32:49.682
No, I can't.

32:49.859 --> 32:51.104
Oh, well...

32:52.195 --> 32:56.359
Maybe you and I could do
something Friday night?

32:56.533 --> 32:58.989
I'd like to, but no.

33:00.621 --> 33:03.456
- Saturday?
- No, not any night.

33:04.708 --> 33:07.200
- I've got a problem.
- Excuse me?

33:07.378 --> 33:11.210
- I can't go out with anyone.
- What if we just had dinner...

33:11.382 --> 33:14.253
Dad! Didn't you hear the
lady? She's got a problem.

33:14.427 --> 33:19.504
- Quit buggin' her and let's get out of here.
- Well, I... We'd better go.

33:19.683 --> 33:23.811
Anyway, it was nice
talking to you, Miss Young.

33:23.979 --> 33:25.354
Annie.

33:25.522 --> 33:29.223
It was nice talking to
you, too, Ben. And Junior.

33:32.780 --> 33:37.278
"Can we go out on Friday
night? On Saturday night?"

33:37.453 --> 33:39.280
"How about Sunday night?"

33:39.455 --> 33:43.619
What's Dad's problem?
Doesn't he have any pride?

33:43.793 --> 33:46.794
Lemonade! Fresh-squeezed lemonade!

33:49.632 --> 33:52.836
Lemonade! Fresh-squeezed lemonade!

33:53.011 --> 33:54.968
I'll have some lemonade.

33:55.138 --> 33:58.009
Certainly, that'll be two dollars.

33:59.852 --> 34:01.394
I've only got a quarter.

34:01.562 --> 34:04.598
Then I guess you're
going thirsty, loser.

34:05.816 --> 34:10.277
Dolly, there's no more
lemonade. Go back and fill it up.

34:10.446 --> 34:13.732
I'm not gonna fill it up.
Why don't you fill it up?

34:13.908 --> 34:17.027
I'm not gonna fill it up.
Why don't you fill it up?

34:17.203 --> 34:21.284
Junior, why don't you
go back and fill it up?

34:21.458 --> 34:25.705
If you do the work, we
might give you a free glass.

34:27.591 --> 34:30.627
OK. I'll go fill it up.

35:15.225 --> 35:16.767
There you go, friends.

35:16.935 --> 35:19.308
You only filled it halfway.

35:19.480 --> 35:21.058
I tried my best.

35:21.232 --> 35:25.182
That's not good enough. For that,
you don't get your free glass.

35:25.362 --> 35:27.687
That's OK by me.

35:29.991 --> 35:33.277
Lemonade! Fresh-squeezed lemonade!

35:33.453 --> 35:36.324
Boy, oh, boy. It sure is hot.

35:36.498 --> 35:39.749
I'm workin' up quite a sweat out here.

35:40.795 --> 35:45.504
Dolly, Madison, how about
a glass of lemonade, huh?

35:45.675 --> 35:48.083
Certainly. That'll be two dollars.

35:48.261 --> 35:51.879
Two dollars? For a glass
of lemonade? For me?

35:53.433 --> 35:55.675
Friggin' brats.

35:56.853 --> 35:58.312
Two dollars.

35:59.356 --> 36:01.265
All right, here you go.

36:19.295 --> 36:21.169
Tangy.

36:26.094 --> 36:28.051
Dad, what do you want for dinner?

36:28.221 --> 36:32.967
- Macaroni and cheese or fish sticks?
- I'd love to have the fish sticks.

36:33.143 --> 36:36.512
- But I got other plans.
- But I was making us dinner.

36:36.689 --> 36:41.066
I can see that, but I'm going out
with Emily from down the street.

36:41.235 --> 36:42.979
Am I gonna get another babysitter?

36:43.154 --> 36:48.315
No, don't be silly. No more babysitters
for you. We got something better, Grandpa.

36:48.493 --> 36:49.987
Stick him, stick him.

36:50.161 --> 36:52.783
They don't make fighters
like they used to.

36:52.956 --> 36:55.364
No more. Nobody's hungry any more.

36:55.542 --> 36:57.665
See?

36:58.629 --> 37:02.544
Dad, don't go out on another
date. You already had one.

37:02.717 --> 37:06.881
It didn't work out. How can I find
us a new mom if I don't keep looking?

37:07.055 --> 37:11.468
We don't need a new mom. Things were
great when it was just you and me.

37:11.644 --> 37:14.265
I mean, we already got stuck with him.

37:14.438 --> 37:18.685
Junior, I am going out
on a date tonight, OK?

37:18.860 --> 37:22.525
I'm gonna get cleaned up. Let
me know if you hear the doorbell.

37:22.697 --> 37:25.271
Don't worry. You'll hear it.

37:35.919 --> 37:40.665
<i>I never met a girl who makes
me feel The way that you do</i>

37:40.841 --> 37:42.633
<i>You're all right</i>

37:43.094 --> 37:46.011
<i>Whenever I'm asked Who
makes my dreams real</i>

37:46.180 --> 37:49.347
<i>I say that you do You're outta sight</i>

37:49.726 --> 37:53.677
<i>So,
fee-fi-fo- fum</i>

37:53.856 --> 37:57.771
<i>Look out, baby, 'cause here I come</i>

37:57.944 --> 38:02.108
<i>And I'm bringing you a love
that's true So get ready</i>

38:02.282 --> 38:04.191
<i>So get ready</i>

38:04.367 --> 38:09.279
<i>I'm gonna try and make you
love me too So get ready</i>

38:09.456 --> 38:12.374
<i>So get ready 'Cause here I come</i>

38:12.543 --> 38:14.666
<i>Get ready 'Cause here I come</i>

38:14.837 --> 38:17.328
<i>I'm on my way</i>

38:21.010 --> 38:23.466
OK, girls.

38:24.431 --> 38:26.637
We've got work to do.

38:45.662 --> 38:47.904
- Argh!
- Ben.

38:48.082 --> 38:53.159
I'm sorry, I'm suddenly
not feeling very well.

38:53.337 --> 39:00.254
I think I just caught that
flu that's been going around.

39:00.428 --> 39:02.088
OK?

39:16.112 --> 39:20.821
So the little monster
screwed you over again, huh?

39:20.992 --> 39:23.115
Maybe I was too strong with him.

39:23.286 --> 39:26.620
Ever since I started dating these
women, he's become so insecure.

39:26.790 --> 39:30.373
Insecure? Little Ben, he's
paranoid, he's jealous.

39:30.544 --> 39:32.453
And he is dangerous.

39:32.629 --> 39:34.503
What are you saying?

39:34.673 --> 39:37.924
I'm saying leave him by the
side of the road and run.

39:38.094 --> 39:41.214
That's a cop-out. The boy
wants to know he's loved.

39:41.390 --> 39:45.470
I'm sure if I devote more
time to him, he'll be better.

39:45.644 --> 39:50.306
<i>Finally, Dad gets the
point. Goodbye, ladiesl</i>

39:57.156 --> 39:59.280
Hey, dog-face.

39:59.451 --> 40:01.906
I knew you'd look!

40:04.247 --> 40:06.287
No running in the hall!

40:09.837 --> 40:11.379
Oh, darn!

40:11.547 --> 40:13.255
Na- na- na- na- na.

40:13.424 --> 40:15.997
You can't come in here!

40:18.262 --> 40:21.429
<i>The bitch must diel</i>

40:29.776 --> 40:33.026
Oh, shoot. She tricked me again.

40:33.196 --> 40:36.814
I wish I had half the brains she does.

40:36.992 --> 40:40.158
Well, there's always tomorrow.

40:43.582 --> 40:45.990
That guy's pathetic.

40:51.757 --> 40:54.545
You're gonna wish you'd never been born.

40:54.719 --> 40:59.630
Ooh, I'm really scared! I'm being
threatened by the Ty-D-Bowl Girl.

40:59.808 --> 41:02.844
Now, why have you been bugging me?

41:03.019 --> 41:06.804
I'll bug whoever I
want. This is my school.

41:06.982 --> 41:10.066
- Says who? -
Me and my M- 80.

41:16.534 --> 41:18.242
You're insane.

41:20.289 --> 41:22.198
Let's get out of here!

41:26.712 --> 41:29.666
<i>Just outta school
Like I'm real real cool</i>

41:29.841 --> 41:33.008
<i>Gotta dance like a fool Got
the message that I gotta be</i>

41:33.178 --> 41:34.292
<i>A wild one...</i>

41:34.471 --> 41:38.136
Out of my way! I can't
hold this one until recess.

41:42.688 --> 41:44.930
This is gonna feel so good.

41:53.783 --> 41:57.282
Clearance sale! Big clearance sale!

41:57.453 --> 42:00.241
Well, well, well, what have we got here?

42:00.415 --> 42:03.665
You girls selling your
daddy's old clothes?

42:03.835 --> 42:05.460
Look at this!

42:05.629 --> 42:08.334
A silk shirt for a dime.

42:08.507 --> 42:10.832
And a suit for a quarter?

42:11.010 --> 42:13.881
I had one like this. I
paid two grand for it.

42:15.682 --> 42:18.138
Wait a minute. Wait a...

42:18.310 --> 42:19.852
Nippy.

42:20.020 --> 42:22.725
What the hell are you doing here?

42:23.774 --> 42:25.850
They're selling you for a nickel?

42:26.902 --> 42:29.310
You little crooks.
Where'd you get this stuff?

42:29.489 --> 42:31.695
We have wholesalers.

42:31.866 --> 42:34.536
The hell you do. This is all mine.

42:34.702 --> 42:38.950
No, it's not. Junior sold us the
whole package for ten dollars.

42:39.124 --> 42:42.042
He did, did he? Well,
we'll see about that.

42:43.629 --> 42:46.298
Finally I get some room in here.

42:46.465 --> 42:50.130
You little psycho. This
time you've gone too far.

42:50.302 --> 42:53.719
- Shut your trap!
- You're an evil boy.

42:53.890 --> 42:56.013
You've gotta learn to
respect your elders.

42:56.184 --> 42:59.968
If your old man won't teach you
some manners, by God, I will.

43:00.146 --> 43:04.477
Oh, yeah? We'll see about that.

43:11.159 --> 43:12.357
My ass!

43:18.417 --> 43:20.456
Hey, buddy, you ready to go?

43:20.627 --> 43:22.170
Sure, but where?

43:22.338 --> 43:25.255
It's a surprise. I
got a fun day planned.

43:25.424 --> 43:27.002
All right, let's go!

43:29.929 --> 43:32.503
Junior, have you seen
your grandfather lately?

43:32.682 --> 43:35.553
Last time I saw him, he was going out.

43:37.437 --> 43:38.812
Ben!

43:38.980 --> 43:40.772
Little Ben!

43:40.941 --> 43:44.476
Help, Little Ben! Help me!

43:44.653 --> 43:46.527
Whoa...

44:08.721 --> 44:10.548
Benjamin Healy.

44:10.724 --> 44:12.763
Time to meet your future.

44:14.478 --> 44:15.936
Help me!

44:16.104 --> 44:18.774
- Help me!
- What is that man doing?

44:18.941 --> 44:21.977
I'm Big Ben Healy. I live here.

44:22.152 --> 44:25.237
You live in that tree?

44:25.406 --> 44:28.740
- Maybe he's Ben Healy's father.
- Shut up. I knew that.

44:28.910 --> 44:32.445
Now move it. Get him down from there.

44:36.001 --> 44:39.121
<i>Hooray!</i>

44:39.755 --> 44:42.839
- All right!
- Hey, Junior, this is for you.

44:43.008 --> 44:44.799
- Thanks, Dad!
- You're welcome.

44:44.968 --> 44:50.308
This is great. First it's a water park,
then a ball game, and now it's a carnival.

44:50.475 --> 44:54.010
I just realised you and I haven't
been spending enough time together.

44:54.188 --> 44:57.189
Dad, I'm glad it's just you and me.

44:57.358 --> 45:00.478
Wow! Look at that cool ride!

45:03.447 --> 45:06.651
- Can I go on it?
- Sure, that's why we're here.

45:07.744 --> 45:10.235
<i>This ride is overl</i>

45:14.334 --> 45:17.620
Whoa, slow down, dude.
You can't go on this ride.

45:17.796 --> 45:21.046
- Why not?
- You gotta be as tall as the tentacle.

45:25.930 --> 45:28.006
But it's only a millimetre.

45:28.182 --> 45:31.053
Get outta here, you're
holding up my line.

45:32.103 --> 45:33.514
Thanks a lot.

45:35.356 --> 45:40.067
I'm sorry, Junior. Maybe next year.
Look. You wanna go on the Munchkin Ride?

45:41.114 --> 45:43.652
No Munchkin Ride. OK.

45:43.825 --> 45:46.696
A candy apple? Would
you like a candy apple?

45:46.870 --> 45:48.779
I'll be right back.

45:52.459 --> 45:55.875
The little baby
couldn't get on the ride?

45:56.046 --> 46:01.800
What's the matter? They afraid
you'd go pee-pee in your diapers?

46:08.184 --> 46:10.972
Hey, you little creep!

46:12.063 --> 46:14.139
Hey, shrimp.

46:14.316 --> 46:18.017
It must be tough being a little shrimpo.

46:18.195 --> 46:19.689
Ticket.

46:31.210 --> 46:34.045
<i>So, are you ready for fun?</i>

46:34.213 --> 46:36.289
Yeah!

46:37.216 --> 46:39.292
<i>You better hang on tight,</i>

46:39.469 --> 46:45.009
<i>because you're about to
experience the Crazy Dancel</i>

47:12.045 --> 47:13.872
This is pansy speed!

47:14.047 --> 47:17.048
Come on, pump it up, pump it up!

47:19.970 --> 47:22.427
Yeah! Yeah, yeah, yeah... Yeah!

48:04.769 --> 48:06.845
I'm gonna puke!

48:09.440 --> 48:11.813
I'm gonna barf!

48:38.848 --> 48:40.259
Please, no.

49:29.903 --> 49:32.062
Why do you do these things to me?

49:32.239 --> 49:36.451
I thought we moved here to start over.
People told me you were a problem child.

49:36.619 --> 49:41.577
I said they were wrong, I said you
just needed a chance to succeed.

49:41.749 --> 49:44.454
We don't have a normal
life, especially me.

49:44.627 --> 49:47.794
I can't go out on a date without
something terrible happening.

49:47.964 --> 49:49.542
Maybe you shouldn't go out.

49:49.716 --> 49:54.010
Junior, just because I interact
with another human being

49:54.179 --> 49:56.636
doesn't mean that I love you any less.

49:56.808 --> 49:58.635
Can't you see that?

49:58.810 --> 50:02.559
- Well, I suppose.
- All right, that's a start.

50:02.731 --> 50:04.391
We can build on that.

50:04.566 --> 50:06.358
I'll make you a deal.

50:06.527 --> 50:09.362
I promise you that I'll
always be there for you.

50:09.530 --> 50:12.614
But you've gotta promise
to be good from now on.

50:12.783 --> 50:16.532
- OK, I promise.
- That's a little too fast. Think about it.

50:16.704 --> 50:21.331
It's not just an empty promise.
This is a pact between you and me

50:21.501 --> 50:25.084
to regain some of the
trust we used to have, OK?

50:25.255 --> 50:27.960
So what do you say?
Are you gonna improve

50:28.133 --> 50:31.300
so I can be right when
I brag to my friends

50:31.470 --> 50:34.804
and tell them I got the
greatest kid that ever was?

50:35.891 --> 50:37.386
Sure.

50:37.560 --> 50:39.766
I'll be better.

50:42.273 --> 50:43.815
Thataboy.

50:56.665 --> 50:58.990
What happened to our house?

51:00.252 --> 51:01.829
Surprise!

51:02.004 --> 51:04.080
- Dad, what have you done?
- Nothing.

51:04.256 --> 51:08.124
The credit for this miracle
goes to one special lady.

51:08.886 --> 51:12.220
Ta-raa...

51:12.390 --> 51:14.881
- I don't understand.
- Is she a maid?

51:15.059 --> 51:17.977
Yeah, made to order.

51:19.481 --> 51:25.235
Benjamin, it's such a pleasure to
have new blood moving into our town.

51:25.404 --> 51:28.025
On behalf of everyone at Dumore Bank,

51:28.198 --> 51:31.199
Dumore Pharmaceuticals
and Dumore Strip Mining,

51:31.368 --> 51:35.152
I just want to extend to
you this little ol' welcome.

51:35.331 --> 51:37.489
I'm LaWanda Dumore.

51:37.667 --> 51:40.953
You did all this because I
opened up a checking account?

51:41.130 --> 51:43.965
You're a very special customer.

51:44.133 --> 51:46.671
Oops!

51:47.803 --> 51:51.718
- Oh, Junior...!
- That's all right, it's only dirt.

51:51.891 --> 51:54.014
I'll have that up in a jiffy.

52:01.318 --> 52:04.402
I'm sorry. Junior can be
a little clumsy at times.

52:04.571 --> 52:06.481
That's all right.

52:06.657 --> 52:12.162
Without compassion and understanding,
what kind of world would we be living in?

52:12.330 --> 52:13.907
Right, sweetie?

52:14.081 --> 52:16.205
Just try to pull one stunt

52:16.376 --> 52:20.587
and I'll cut you off at the
knees and bury you alive.

52:22.465 --> 52:26.415
- She's an incredible woman.
- You haven't heard the best part.

52:26.595 --> 52:29.051
She's worth $50 million.

52:32.644 --> 52:37.437
I am so sorry, I just completely
lost track of the time.

52:37.608 --> 52:39.232
I gotta run.

52:39.401 --> 52:43.446
I got a meeting with some cockamamie
shareholder grievance committee.

52:43.614 --> 52:46.615
But we should get together
for dinner real soon.

52:46.784 --> 52:49.275
I could cook us up something special.

52:49.453 --> 52:51.612
Well, sure. That would
be nice, Miss Dumore.

52:51.789 --> 52:55.040
Oh, no. LaWanda.

52:55.210 --> 52:56.704
LaWanda.

53:04.470 --> 53:05.928
Bye-bye!

53:11.978 --> 53:16.687
Five oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, ooh!

53:17.817 --> 53:19.228
50 million!

53:31.916 --> 53:35.665
LaWanda, it smells great in there.
Sure you don't need any help?

53:35.837 --> 53:37.415
No, Benjamin.

53:37.589 --> 53:42.086
You just stay down here and relax.
I'm taking care of everything.

53:42.261 --> 53:43.636
OK.

53:48.976 --> 53:52.559
<i>I know I promised Dad
I wouldn't hurt LaWanda,</i>

53:52.730 --> 53:55.601
<i>but I never said the dog couldn't.</i>

54:01.531 --> 54:03.987
You're falling into a trance.

54:04.159 --> 54:08.620
Your eyes are getting heavy.
You can't move a muscle.

54:08.789 --> 54:12.834
When you wake up, you'll
be thinking of one thing.

54:13.002 --> 54:15.328
Destroy LaWanda.

54:15.506 --> 54:17.333
She is your enemy.

54:17.508 --> 54:20.509
She is like a cat, but uglier.

54:20.678 --> 54:23.134
You want to bite her butt off

54:23.306 --> 54:26.509
and scare her away, so
she'll never come back.

54:26.684 --> 54:28.558
When I clap my hands,

54:28.728 --> 54:33.058
you'll come out of the
trance and do whatever I say.

54:33.942 --> 54:35.567
One,

54:35.736 --> 54:36.898
two,

54:37.070 --> 54:38.565
three.

54:41.075 --> 54:43.482
One, two,

54:43.661 --> 54:45.238
three.

54:46.956 --> 54:48.534
Nippy?

54:49.750 --> 54:51.790
Nippy? Hey, Nip, come on.

54:52.462 --> 54:55.167
- Uh-oh!
Nippy. - Nippy!

54:56.049 --> 54:57.757
Nippy, where are you?

55:11.441 --> 55:14.146
- What have you been up to?
- None of your business.

55:14.319 --> 55:18.400
- You're not my mother.
- You are a mean little boy.

55:18.574 --> 55:23.817
Go up to your room and change your clothes.
I will not have an unkempt boy at my table.

55:23.996 --> 55:25.574
Your table?

55:26.374 --> 55:27.868
Get!

55:37.636 --> 55:39.842
Clowns!

55:40.013 --> 55:42.587
I hate clowns!

55:44.059 --> 55:47.310
This woman is bustin' my balls!

55:49.065 --> 55:51.936
Hey, guys, what are you
doing for dinner tonight?

55:57.325 --> 56:01.025
I would like to make a
toast to a terrific lady

56:01.204 --> 56:04.288
who has made us feel so
welcome in our new town,

56:04.457 --> 56:08.751
who's fixed up our house, and
cooked us this incredible feast.

56:08.920 --> 56:10.580
- Hear, hear.
- To LaWanda.

56:10.756 --> 56:12.713
- To LaWanda.
- To LaWanda.

56:14.718 --> 56:16.711
That is so sweet.

56:16.887 --> 56:19.212
I hope y'all enjoy this.

56:19.390 --> 56:22.344
I had my staff compile
their favourite recipes.

56:22.518 --> 56:26.053
Well, I for one am
famished, so let's eat.

56:51.842 --> 56:56.303
What in the hell is in this salad?

56:56.472 --> 56:58.512
It's blue cheese.

57:01.853 --> 57:03.477
Oh, my God.

57:04.272 --> 57:07.890
All right, come on! Get LaWanda!

57:11.488 --> 57:14.359
This salad is infested!

57:19.371 --> 57:21.115
Get it! Get it!

57:22.416 --> 57:24.374
This is a plague!

57:31.926 --> 57:34.334
LaWanda, I'm coming.

57:52.866 --> 57:54.325
Junior, you failed me.

57:54.493 --> 57:57.281
But, Dad, I swear, she hates me.

57:57.455 --> 58:01.951
- We had a deal and you let me down.
- She's different from all the others.

58:02.126 --> 58:04.119
LaWanda is bad.

58:04.295 --> 58:09.171
Junior, you think all women are bad. That
woman has nothing but good intentions.

58:09.342 --> 58:12.546
She made us dinner and this
is how you pay her back?

58:12.721 --> 58:14.880
I am really disappointed in you.

58:15.057 --> 58:18.924
I don't think I'll ever
be able to trust you again.

58:26.986 --> 58:29.738
Benjamin, I hope you
weren't too harsh on him.

58:29.906 --> 58:34.201
- I think I've failed as a father.
- Oh, no, not at all.

58:34.370 --> 58:37.157
There's only so much you can handle.

58:37.332 --> 58:42.575
A father's good for some things, but
you need a mother for emotional guidance.

58:42.754 --> 58:46.455
Values... Morality?

58:46.633 --> 58:49.753
Perhaps I should talk to the boy?

58:49.928 --> 58:53.214
- Well, yeah. That might be...
- Good.

58:56.602 --> 58:59.769
Listen here, you little monster.

58:59.939 --> 59:01.848
I am mightier than you are.

59:02.025 --> 59:05.773
And I always get what
I want, so back off.

59:05.945 --> 59:10.940
Because whether you like it or
not, I am gonna marry your daddy.

59:11.118 --> 59:14.902
And when I do, you'll be on the
first plane to boarding school,

59:15.080 --> 59:16.989
in Baghdad.

59:18.042 --> 59:20.711
Dad, you gotta believe
me. She said Baghdad.

59:20.878 --> 59:23.880
Forget it, you have no
credibility any more.

59:24.049 --> 59:27.584
Let's see if we can get through
this evening like a normal family,

59:27.761 --> 59:30.087
without anything bizarre happening. OK?

59:30.264 --> 59:31.639
Come on.

59:31.807 --> 59:36.683
Come here, look at the chart. I
got 15 gold stars this semester.

59:37.897 --> 59:42.061
- Do you have anything nice to show me?
- Sure, just the usual stuff.

59:42.235 --> 59:43.813
There's my desk.

59:51.412 --> 59:53.700
Here's my science project.

59:53.873 --> 59:55.699
<i>I'm innocentl I'm innocentl</i>

59:59.462 --> 01:00:01.585
There's my teacher, Mr Thorn.

01:00:01.756 --> 01:00:03.464
Mom, this is Mr Thorn.

01:00:03.633 --> 01:00:05.922
She's doing very well. Awfully good.

01:00:06.094 --> 01:00:11.005
<i>Attention, parents. Please take your
seats for tonight's special programme,</i>

01:00:11.183 --> 01:00:12.642
<i>Salute to Democracy.</i>

01:00:12.809 --> 01:00:16.227
<i>Because you know it's, like,
democracy and we're saluting it.</i>

01:00:31.038 --> 01:00:33.529
- Hello, Sam.
- Hello, Baldy.

01:00:33.708 --> 01:00:36.625
Sure is great to see all those
parents out there tonight.

01:00:36.794 --> 01:00:39.464
- It sure is.
- It's so sweet!

01:00:39.631 --> 01:00:41.588
You can't do that to me!

01:00:41.758 --> 01:00:43.252
What are you...?

01:00:49.183 --> 01:00:52.967
Sorry about the delay, folks. We're
experiencing technical difficulties.

01:00:53.145 --> 01:00:57.013
Yeah, I had to scratch my balls.

01:00:57.984 --> 01:01:02.527
- Hey, I didn't know eagles had balls.
- Yeah, I'm a bald eagle.

01:01:02.697 --> 01:01:05.864
<i>Did you know I could fart The Star
- Spangled Banner?</i>

01:01:06.035 --> 01:01:09.404
- Really? OK...
- Junior, no!

01:01:16.671 --> 01:01:19.756
- Who are you?
- Who the hell are you?

01:01:20.926 --> 01:01:22.254
Trixie!

01:01:22.427 --> 01:01:26.093
I can't leave you alone for 10
minutes. Why did you do this?

01:01:26.265 --> 01:01:28.304
But, Mom...

01:01:28.475 --> 01:01:32.604
Those kids wouldn't let me
be part of the puppet show.

01:01:32.772 --> 01:01:37.517
That's no excuse for... Come
on, we are going right now!

01:01:41.865 --> 01:01:45.697
Great show, huh, Dad?
I was saving you a seat.

01:01:47.913 --> 01:01:49.537
Annie...

01:01:49.706 --> 01:01:51.165
Annie!

01:01:51.333 --> 01:01:53.041
Nurse!

01:01:54.211 --> 01:01:57.546
Hang on! Wait!

01:01:57.716 --> 01:01:59.922
Look, Annie, will you wait?!

01:02:00.093 --> 01:02:05.005
- I understand what you're going through.
- You couldn't possibly.

01:02:05.182 --> 01:02:08.765
- I do, believe me. We could help each other.
- Just forget it.

01:02:08.936 --> 01:02:11.724
Trixie consumes my entire life.

01:02:11.898 --> 01:02:14.436
I don't have room for anything else.

01:02:26.246 --> 01:02:29.082
<i>Boy, that girl sure showed them.</i>

01:02:29.250 --> 01:02:35.123
<i>Who would have thought that sweet
nurse would have such a crazy daughter?</i>

01:02:35.298 --> 01:02:38.501
<i>What a mess. I have
to get Junior a mother.</i>

01:02:38.676 --> 01:02:42.757
<i>Annie would be perfect, she's smart
and sweet and pretty and loving.</i>

01:02:42.931 --> 01:02:47.011
<i>It would be great to have a
nurse on call 24 hours a day.</i>

01:02:47.769 --> 01:02:51.305
<i>On the other hand, LaWanda
will go out with me.</i>

01:02:54.027 --> 01:02:58.321
<i>Oh, God, please let him
marry that rich broad.</i>

01:02:58.490 --> 01:03:01.575
<i>'Cause I really need the money.</i>

01:03:02.494 --> 01:03:04.617
<i>I gotta get out of this house.</i>

01:03:04.788 --> 01:03:08.656
<i>My son's a loser, my dog has vanished.</i>

01:03:08.834 --> 01:03:12.583
<i>And that punk Junior's
the devil come to life.</i>

01:03:16.593 --> 01:03:19.796
Nippy! You've come back!

01:03:19.971 --> 01:03:23.804
And I thought you abandoned me.

01:03:23.976 --> 01:03:26.301
I should have known better.

01:03:28.314 --> 01:03:32.098
You'll always stand
by my side, won't you?

01:03:34.862 --> 01:03:37.353
You're my one true friend.

01:03:40.160 --> 01:03:41.703
Nippy...?

01:03:42.496 --> 01:03:45.782
Nippy, what the hell happened to you?

01:03:55.385 --> 01:03:57.876
I'm losing my mind.

01:03:58.055 --> 01:04:02.633
Junior's getting worse. We can't even
figure out what he did to that dog.

01:04:02.810 --> 01:04:05.764
Benjamin, I'm gonna be blunt.

01:04:05.938 --> 01:04:09.521
- Your child is in a state of emergency.
- I'm doing my best.

01:04:09.692 --> 01:04:12.527
Benjamin, it is not your fault.

01:04:12.695 --> 01:04:15.233
You're a fine man.

01:04:15.406 --> 01:04:20.698
But one lone individual
just cannot do this job.

01:04:20.871 --> 01:04:25.082
Your child needs two parental figures.

01:04:27.378 --> 01:04:29.501
- LaWanda...
- Yes?

01:04:34.803 --> 01:04:36.962
I'd like to ask you a question.

01:04:39.850 --> 01:04:42.424
- Junior...
- Hey, Dad, what's up?

01:04:42.603 --> 01:04:44.560
I've got some family news for you.

01:04:44.730 --> 01:04:47.435
- Is Big Ben moving out?
- No, I'm not talking...

01:04:47.608 --> 01:04:50.396
Listen to me, this is important. I...

01:04:51.738 --> 01:04:55.570
I've made a decision. I'm
going to marry LaWanda.

01:04:55.742 --> 01:05:00.239
- But, Dad, she hates me!
- She doesn't hate... That's ridiculous.

01:05:00.414 --> 01:05:04.364
She wants what's best for you.
She wants to make us a home.

01:05:04.543 --> 01:05:07.165
But she's gonna destroy everything.

01:05:07.338 --> 01:05:11.550
Three men living together in a
house is a mess. It's unnatural.

01:05:11.718 --> 01:05:14.921
Plus, I feel she's a woman
of strong moral fibre.

01:05:15.096 --> 01:05:17.718
She'll be a good influence
over us, especially you.

01:05:17.891 --> 01:05:19.765
You're making a big mistake.

01:05:19.935 --> 01:05:22.971
I am a grown-up and I will
do anything I wanna do.

01:05:23.146 --> 01:05:26.481
And on Saturday I'm
going to marry LaWanda.

01:05:27.819 --> 01:05:31.105
Benjamin, we got a jillion things to do.

01:05:31.281 --> 01:05:36.109
Caterers, invitations and a one
o'clock appointment for a blood test.

01:05:36.286 --> 01:05:37.662
I'll be right there.

01:05:37.830 --> 01:05:42.575
Tell your grandpa I'll be back in a
couple of hours and then we'll talk.

01:06:04.316 --> 01:06:08.610
We're from the animal control
unit. There's a local rabies scare.

01:06:08.779 --> 01:06:13.572
- We're looking for any strange animals.
- Nippy's been acting a little funny lately.

01:06:13.743 --> 01:06:17.078
- You better let us see him.
- OK.

01:06:20.376 --> 01:06:22.867
- Not now.
- Come on.

01:06:27.384 --> 01:06:29.709
- Here you go.
- What the hell happened here?

01:06:29.886 --> 01:06:31.511
It sure ain't rabies.

01:06:31.680 --> 01:06:35.049
Nippy's lost his spunk.
Can you do anything for him?

01:06:35.225 --> 01:06:36.850
Maybe.

01:06:40.397 --> 01:06:44.561
- What kind of diet's he been on?
- We just feed him table scraps.

01:06:46.446 --> 01:06:50.064
Think we've found the problem.
Why don't you come with us?

01:06:50.408 --> 01:06:53.824
A time like this, there's only
one thing you can count on.

01:06:56.873 --> 01:06:58.831
- Chow Down.
- Chow Down?

01:06:59.001 --> 01:07:00.744
That's right, sonny. Chow Down.

01:07:00.919 --> 01:07:04.205
Now in three delicious flavours.
Beef, chicken and horse.

01:07:05.800 --> 01:07:07.924
Rich, meaty flavour,

01:07:08.095 --> 01:07:13.302
all simmered in a delicious
home- style gravy. Mmm...

01:07:13.475 --> 01:07:16.227
What dog could resist?

01:07:16.395 --> 01:07:18.352
Come and get it!

01:07:19.398 --> 01:07:22.269
Wow! Look at him chow down.

01:07:22.443 --> 01:07:25.444
You bet, and wait till you
see how shiny his coat gets.

01:07:30.952 --> 01:07:32.612
Glad we could be of assistance.

01:07:32.788 --> 01:07:35.540
Come on, pal. Let's get back to work.

01:07:39.003 --> 01:07:41.209
What's in that little black box?

01:07:41.380 --> 01:07:43.337
You don't wanna mess with that.

01:07:43.507 --> 01:07:46.212
That's blood tests from a rabid dog.

01:07:47.971 --> 01:07:50.544
Blood tests, huh?

01:07:51.975 --> 01:07:54.181
Healy, Benjamin.

01:07:54.352 --> 01:07:57.223
Looks fine to me.

01:07:57.397 --> 01:08:01.147
And who's next? Dumore, LaWanda.

01:08:01.319 --> 01:08:03.228
Again.

01:08:03.405 --> 01:08:05.314
OK...

01:08:08.201 --> 01:08:09.696
Wow!

01:08:13.707 --> 01:08:18.251
Operator, give me the County Health
Department. This is an emergency.

01:08:22.341 --> 01:08:25.591
- It's darling, LaWanda!
- My goodness!

01:08:25.761 --> 01:08:29.345
Y'all are the best friends
a girl could ever have.

01:08:29.515 --> 01:08:33.348
LaWanda, you're always
the most beautiful bride.

01:08:36.607 --> 01:08:39.145
Excuse me, ma'am. Is Ms Dumore here?

01:08:39.318 --> 01:08:43.482
Oh, my Lord! Somebody hired strippers.

01:08:46.868 --> 01:08:48.859
You want me?

01:08:51.207 --> 01:08:54.161
- Come and get me.
- She's already foaming at the mouth.

01:08:54.335 --> 01:08:56.743
Better move fast.

01:08:57.796 --> 01:09:01.380
- Here we go.
- You brutes are playing rough!

01:09:01.551 --> 01:09:04.386
- What are you doing?
- We're from the County Board of Health.

01:09:04.554 --> 01:09:06.796
- You have rabies.
- What?!

01:09:06.973 --> 01:09:10.058
You cannot do this to me!

01:09:10.227 --> 01:09:13.477
I am rich. I am powerful.

01:09:13.647 --> 01:09:16.600
I do not have rabies!

01:09:17.902 --> 01:09:21.603
LaWanda, how are you feeling?

01:09:21.781 --> 01:09:23.406
How am I feeling?

01:09:23.575 --> 01:09:26.029
How am I feeling? I'm tied to a bed!

01:09:26.202 --> 01:09:29.120
Maybe this picture will cheer you up.

01:09:32.292 --> 01:09:37.287
Maybe this is a little too much excitement
for LaWanda. Why don't we clear the room...

01:09:37.464 --> 01:09:39.837
OK. Bye, LaWanda.
Come on, Dad. Let's go.

01:09:40.009 --> 01:09:43.593
No, sonny. Your dad means we should go.

01:09:43.764 --> 01:09:45.139
All of us.

01:09:48.227 --> 01:09:50.350
Give the lovebirds a chance to be alone.

01:09:50.520 --> 01:09:52.145
This might cheer you up.

01:09:52.314 --> 01:09:54.521
I'll put this over here.

01:09:54.692 --> 01:09:58.904
I talked to Father Flanagan, and he said
there's no need to rush into these things.

01:09:59.072 --> 01:10:01.479
We can push back the ceremony.

01:10:01.658 --> 01:10:06.035
Benjamin, I do not
like being patronised.

01:10:06.204 --> 01:10:10.285
I don't care if we have to
roll this gurney down the aisle.

01:10:10.459 --> 01:10:13.579
Tomorrow, we are getting married.

01:10:14.922 --> 01:10:19.169
Big Ben's Sporting Goods is
embarking on a major expansion.

01:10:19.343 --> 01:10:23.211
We're about to come into
a huge cash infusion.

01:10:28.395 --> 01:10:30.553
I swear, you're important to me.

01:10:30.730 --> 01:10:35.310
I've made my decision. When I
die, I want people to remember me.

01:10:35.487 --> 01:10:39.650
And after tonight's plastic
surgery, I'm gonna be someone,

01:10:39.825 --> 01:10:43.657
because I'm gonna have the
biggest nose in the world.

01:11:13.319 --> 01:11:16.320
This place is awfully loud.
You sure you wanna eat here?

01:11:16.489 --> 01:11:18.612
Of course. Pizza's my favourite food.

01:11:18.783 --> 01:11:21.404
It is? Oh. Fine.

01:11:21.577 --> 01:11:24.995
Hello. We'd like a table for...

01:11:25.833 --> 01:11:28.205
- Annie?
- Ben?

01:11:31.964 --> 01:11:36.461
<i>Maybe I'm gettin' soft, but
I just had the craziest idea.</i>

01:11:40.849 --> 01:11:45.143
So then Dad dropped his pants on
live TV and he lost the election.

01:11:45.312 --> 01:11:47.471
Here's a campaign picture.

01:11:47.648 --> 01:11:52.109
What are you jerks doing here? I was
supposed to have dinner with my mom.

01:11:52.278 --> 01:11:55.030
Quit yapping and let
'em have a good time.

01:11:55.198 --> 01:11:57.523
Everybody smile for your
complimentary photograph.

01:11:57.700 --> 01:12:00.370
Say "Pizzarrific!"

01:12:02.872 --> 01:12:05.446
Smile for your complimentary photograph.

01:12:08.378 --> 01:12:12.839
Oh, boy, baby! When you're with
me, it's first class all the way.

01:12:13.008 --> 01:12:17.138
We went to the restaurant, they
let us in, we didn't have to wait.

01:12:17.305 --> 01:12:20.757
It's not like the restaurants
where you talk into the clown face.

01:12:20.934 --> 01:12:27.055
It's not like that at all. Later on, we'll
go home and I'll put on the Zorro outfit.

01:12:27.233 --> 01:12:31.776
Well, here's to an
evening we'll never forget.

01:12:34.824 --> 01:12:36.283
- It's them!
- Who?

01:12:36.451 --> 01:12:38.776
It's him and it's her
and they're together.

01:12:38.954 --> 01:12:42.572
He has this flatulence problem and
he's eating a pizza, and it's her...

01:12:42.749 --> 01:12:44.457
Hey, it's Peabody.

01:12:44.626 --> 01:12:48.245
I hate that guy. He's
got such a grating voice.

01:12:48.422 --> 01:12:51.874
Yeah. I'll shut him up.

01:12:55.555 --> 01:12:58.010
Here, let me. Terrible
kids, just terrible.

01:12:59.267 --> 01:13:02.054
That's pretty good. Let me try.

01:13:05.065 --> 01:13:08.019
You rotten kids, you
should be locked in cages!

01:13:09.112 --> 01:13:11.021
You can't talk to them like that.

01:13:11.197 --> 01:13:12.857
Screw you, pal!

01:13:13.033 --> 01:13:16.651
I can talk about anybody however I want.

01:13:45.234 --> 01:13:46.609
Yeah!

01:13:51.323 --> 01:13:54.028
Two can play at this game!

01:13:56.120 --> 01:13:58.991
- Let's get 'em!
- All right!

01:14:16.727 --> 01:14:19.930
- Keep it moving, come on.
- Quit pushing, it wasn't our fault.

01:14:20.105 --> 01:14:24.055
- I got hit on the head with an egg.
- You can never come back again.

01:14:24.235 --> 01:14:26.642
- That's a big loss.
- Yeah, we said no olives.

01:14:26.821 --> 01:14:29.573
Did everybody get enough to eat?

01:14:29.740 --> 01:14:33.785
Annie, you look like you could use
some dessert. Right around here.

01:14:34.871 --> 01:14:38.038
- Your dad's pretty funny.
- He takes after me.

01:14:38.208 --> 01:14:41.542
Junior, I'm sorry I hit
you with the fire hose.

01:14:41.712 --> 01:14:45.330
That's OK. I'm sorry I made
you barf on the Crazy Dance.

01:14:47.092 --> 01:14:48.635
I couldn't believe it...

01:14:48.802 --> 01:14:50.961
...right in your face!

01:14:51.138 --> 01:14:53.809
You know, I think your dad likes my mom.

01:14:53.976 --> 01:14:58.270
Normally when a guy does that, I
run him over or knock him downstairs.

01:14:58.439 --> 01:15:00.313
I gotta look out for her.

01:15:00.483 --> 01:15:04.018
But your dad, he
doesn't bug me that much.

01:15:04.195 --> 01:15:07.113
You know, your mom doesn't
bother me that much either.

01:15:08.533 --> 01:15:09.908
Pals?

01:15:11.202 --> 01:15:12.697
Pals.

01:15:25.426 --> 01:15:27.253
My arms.

01:15:28.304 --> 01:15:30.261
My arms are free!

01:15:32.684 --> 01:15:34.142
Oh, my Lord.

01:15:35.103 --> 01:15:37.179
What's wrong with my face?

01:15:39.774 --> 01:15:41.601
What is this?

01:15:53.040 --> 01:15:56.160
Oh... Oh!

01:15:58.671 --> 01:16:01.376
I'm Pinocchio!

01:16:14.646 --> 01:16:16.888
Good, you made it.

01:16:17.065 --> 01:16:19.735
Why did you want me
to come over so late?

01:16:19.902 --> 01:16:22.938
- You know how you said you liked my dad?
- Yeah.

01:16:23.113 --> 01:16:26.814
I have the weirdest idea. I think
our parents should get married.

01:16:26.992 --> 01:16:32.153
What are you talking about?
Your dad's already taken.

01:16:32.331 --> 01:16:36.331
Well, he might be having
a slight change of plans.

01:16:41.050 --> 01:16:43.672
Oh, great. Big Ben's up.

01:16:44.846 --> 01:16:48.381
Who are you? And you should be in bed,

01:16:48.558 --> 01:16:50.302
resting up for tomorrow's wedding.

01:16:50.477 --> 01:16:52.137
There ain't gonna be no wedding.

01:16:52.312 --> 01:16:56.357
I made LaWanda so ugly, no
one's gonna wanna marry her.

01:16:56.525 --> 01:16:59.099
LaWanda Dumore's the key
to my financial comeback.

01:16:59.278 --> 01:17:03.358
And nobody, nobody, is
gonna stand in my way.

01:17:05.368 --> 01:17:08.951
- Nippy, where'd you go?
- This guy's gonna be a problem.

01:17:09.122 --> 01:17:12.158
No, he's not. Let's get him!

01:17:12.333 --> 01:17:13.532
Yeah!

01:17:28.727 --> 01:17:30.934
I'm really tired.

01:17:31.980 --> 01:17:36.393
Come on, don't wuss out. This is the
only way to get our parents together.

01:17:36.569 --> 01:17:38.443
Now come on!

01:17:48.957 --> 01:17:53.370
Whoa! It's so much bigger than
it looked on Mr Thorn's slide.

01:17:57.549 --> 01:17:59.838
So, how do you start this thing?

01:18:00.010 --> 01:18:03.261
I don't know. Guess
you just make a wish.

01:18:03.431 --> 01:18:07.511
Mighty Love Rock, we come to
you today to ask a big favour.

01:18:07.685 --> 01:18:11.849
We got two parents and we want
them to fall in love and get married

01:18:12.023 --> 01:18:14.395
so I don't get stuck
with that bitch LaWanda.

01:18:14.568 --> 01:18:17.819
I hope this isn't asking too much,

01:18:17.989 --> 01:18:22.201
but you're a magic rock so you're
probably used to these things.

01:18:22.369 --> 01:18:24.776
Please help us.

01:18:52.359 --> 01:18:53.937
Bye, Annie.

01:19:00.576 --> 01:19:02.735
All right, Junior. Get up.

01:19:02.912 --> 01:19:06.826
It's a big day. Today
you get yourself a mom.

01:19:09.461 --> 01:19:12.083
Has Junior ever run away before?

01:19:12.256 --> 01:19:16.965
No, it's this wedding thing. It's got him
upset. I'm sorry he dragged Trixie into this.

01:19:17.136 --> 01:19:21.845
Don't let Trixie off the hook. She's usually
responsible for her share of the action.

01:19:22.016 --> 01:19:24.934
Junior can be the biggest
menace who ever lived.

01:19:25.103 --> 01:19:29.730
Well, maybe he was a nuisance
in that little town you're from.

01:19:29.900 --> 01:19:32.771
You're in Mortville and around
here Trixie runs the show.

01:19:32.945 --> 01:19:37.690
She's an amateur. Nobody has caused
the amount of destruction Junior has.

01:19:39.452 --> 01:19:42.536
I guess it's a stupid
thing to argue about.

01:19:46.334 --> 01:19:47.994
There they are.

01:20:02.978 --> 01:20:05.516
Will you look at that?

01:20:05.689 --> 01:20:08.263
Hey, guys. Good morning.

01:20:11.278 --> 01:20:14.944
Hey, the Love Rock worked!

01:20:15.116 --> 01:20:18.366
Up and at 'em, Junior,
let's go. Attaboy.

01:20:23.917 --> 01:20:27.167
So, do you need a ride home?

01:20:27.337 --> 01:20:31.750
No, I think we're gonna take a
little walk and have a little talk.

01:20:31.925 --> 01:20:35.176
Besides, you've probably got
millions of things to do today.

01:20:35.346 --> 01:20:38.466
Yeah, I guess I do have plans.

01:20:38.641 --> 01:20:41.559
So, see ya.

01:20:58.830 --> 01:21:01.867
Typical, Little Ben. You always
wait till the last damn minute.

01:21:02.042 --> 01:21:04.829
Dad, don't you wanna go see LaWanda?

01:21:05.003 --> 01:21:08.669
There's a tradition. The groom can't
see the bride before the ceremony.

01:21:08.841 --> 01:21:11.546
- But... but...
- But... but, my ass.

01:21:11.719 --> 01:21:14.044
Beat it, we're busy.

01:21:14.221 --> 01:21:18.089
<i>Oh, nol If Dad doesn't
see LaWanda's big schnozz,</i>

01:21:18.267 --> 01:21:20.177
<i>I'm screwed.</i>

01:22:12.326 --> 01:22:13.904
Miss Dumore!

01:22:15.746 --> 01:22:18.783
- Are you all right?
- Dad, look at her face.

01:22:21.669 --> 01:22:23.709
Hey, what happened?

01:22:23.880 --> 01:22:26.087
Thought you had me licked, huh?

01:22:26.258 --> 01:22:29.093
It's amazing what $382,000 worth

01:22:29.261 --> 01:22:32.844
of last-minute double overtime
plastic surgery can do.

01:22:35.059 --> 01:22:37.183
Benjamin, what's the hold-up?

01:22:38.522 --> 01:22:39.897
Fine.

01:22:40.816 --> 01:22:43.734
Come on, sit down, kid.

01:22:43.902 --> 01:22:45.480
Hit it, padre.

01:22:49.158 --> 01:22:52.942
Dearly beloved, we are gathered
today, on this day of joy,

01:22:53.121 --> 01:22:55.363
to unite these two wonderful people.

01:22:55.540 --> 01:22:57.996
No! Dad, don't do it!

01:22:58.168 --> 01:23:00.837
Go for it, Little Ben. Make me proud!

01:23:05.092 --> 01:23:08.093
We are gathered together
on this day of joy,

01:23:08.262 --> 01:23:10.587
<i>to unite you two wonderful p...</i>

01:23:15.937 --> 01:23:17.597
Who the hell is that?

01:23:17.772 --> 01:23:19.812
That's my pal Trixie.

01:23:27.700 --> 01:23:29.823
I hate children!

01:23:29.994 --> 01:23:32.320
They ruin everything!

01:23:32.497 --> 01:23:37.539
If I had enough power, I'd wipe
them off the face of the earth.

01:23:50.766 --> 01:23:51.965
Junior!

01:24:00.777 --> 01:24:02.485
Nippy! No!

01:24:10.371 --> 01:24:12.328
No, Miss Dumore! No!

01:24:15.459 --> 01:24:17.286
I command you to stop.

01:24:20.132 --> 01:24:24.130
Trixie! You come down
here right this minute!

01:24:26.055 --> 01:24:29.923
How many times have I told you
not to operate heavy machinery?

01:24:30.101 --> 01:24:33.019
- Annie!
- Ben, I am so sorry.

01:24:33.188 --> 01:24:36.058
I couldn't stop her. We've
ruined your whole wedding.

01:24:36.233 --> 01:24:40.313
This wedding was meant to be
ruined. Annie, you're the one I want.

01:24:41.572 --> 01:24:42.947
What?

01:24:45.951 --> 01:24:48.407
- Yeah!
- We did it!

01:24:48.955 --> 01:24:53.949
What the hell are you doing? You gotta
scrape your lovely bride off the ground.

01:24:54.127 --> 01:24:57.828
Dad, I don't want to marry
LaWanda. I've found someone else.

01:24:58.006 --> 01:25:02.467
Who cares? LaWanda Dumore is a
gold- mine. She's worth millions.

01:25:02.636 --> 01:25:05.209
Dad, if you like her
so much, you marry her.

01:25:07.057 --> 01:25:09.465
Yeah. Why not?

01:25:16.610 --> 01:25:17.985
Thanks, buddy.

01:25:18.153 --> 01:25:21.357
Dad, I wouldn't have
done it for anyone else.

01:25:26.078 --> 01:25:27.454
Let me help you.

01:25:27.622 --> 01:25:30.493
One... two... three...

01:25:35.964 --> 01:25:37.589
Let me help you.

01:25:37.758 --> 01:25:39.834
Not you, dummy.

01:25:40.886 --> 01:25:42.511
Come on, there we go.

01:25:42.680 --> 01:25:44.756
Get your mitts off me.

01:25:44.932 --> 01:25:47.174
I hate your whole family.

01:25:47.351 --> 01:25:50.720
Honey, come here. I'm not like them.

01:25:50.897 --> 01:25:53.898
I'm different. I love you.

01:25:55.443 --> 01:25:58.017
You said you love me?

01:26:00.782 --> 01:26:02.159
Yeuch!

01:26:17.176 --> 01:26:18.255
Yeah!

01:26:25.101 --> 01:26:27.343
Nippy!
