00:08.717 --> 00:11.551
Annie, Max, Dylan.

00:13.388 --> 00:16.506
Are you in there? Can you hear me?

00:18.000 --> 00:24.074

00:45.212 --> 00:46.373
We're just gonna draw more.

00:46.880 --> 00:48.880
As long as they don't look like them,
we'll manage.

00:49.383 --> 00:52.046
The propellers, we need to get to them
and make a hasty retreat.

00:52.135 --> 00:53.376
Go. I can distract them.

00:53.804 --> 00:54.840
- Charlie...
- I got this.

00:55.514 --> 00:57.722
Hey! Everyone, this way!

01:07.442 --> 01:08.523
<i>Victor, do you copy?</i>

01:09.486 --> 01:10.943
<i>Victor, tell me you're all right.</i>

01:12.573 --> 01:14.735
Morgan? Hey, everyone, this way!

01:15.158 --> 01:17.616
<i>- Charlie, you okay?</i>
- Yeah, I'm okay. Victor is too.

01:20.455 --> 01:24.825
I heard gunshots. You haven't killed
any walkers with burns on them, have you?

01:25.377 --> 01:28.177
No, but we are currently enjoying
a leisurely stroll with some of them.

01:30.424 --> 01:32.666
Stay as far away from them as you can.

01:32.759 --> 01:36.343
We've seen what happens to people
who were exposed, and it ain't pretty.

02:19.014 --> 02:21.552
<i>Alicia's out of range
looking for Max and Annie.</i>

02:21.642 --> 02:24.385
You're still near the balloon, right?
I'm heading toward you now...

02:24.478 --> 02:27.141
Don't.
The propellers survived the descent.

02:27.230 --> 02:30.270
We just need a vehicle to move them,
preferably something that's terrestrial.

02:30.567 --> 02:32.399
<i>Okay. I'm on it.</i>

02:33.320 --> 02:35.607
Hold off, Morgan. We're on our way.

02:36.156 --> 02:39.445
June? No, we're not gonna risk
anybody else being exposed.

02:39.534 --> 02:42.197
Morgan, I can't get a hold of John.
I don't know where he is.

02:42.287 --> 02:44.074
Strand and Charlie, we can help.

02:49.836 --> 02:52.328
You want to help? Finish that plane.

02:52.964 --> 02:56.378
Grace, do you copy? We need your help now.

02:58.929 --> 03:00.511
What is it? What's going on?

03:00.597 --> 03:02.429
Look, some of my people, they...

03:02.974 --> 03:05.216
they crashed
on the other side of the blockade.

03:05.644 --> 03:07.806
Crashed? Are they all right?

03:08.271 --> 03:10.934
Yeah, they are. Look, I need your truck.

03:11.024 --> 03:13.357
It's the only way
we're gonna be able to finish the plane.

03:13.443 --> 03:14.650
<i>Where are you?</i>

03:15.237 --> 03:16.728
I just went past the roadblock.

03:16.822 --> 03:20.315
You're inside? Morgan, please.
You don't have a suit.

03:20.409 --> 03:22.776
You have no way to decontaminate.
If you get any closer...

03:22.869 --> 03:24.906
<i>We have what we need to fix the plane.</i>

03:24.996 --> 03:27.283
We just need to get back
to the truck stop.

03:29.376 --> 03:31.333
I want to help, I do,

03:32.170 --> 03:34.833
but I can't leave here
until this generator is hooked up.

03:35.465 --> 03:38.505
Or else you're gonna have a lot less time
to finish that plane than you need.

03:41.096 --> 03:43.216
There's some houses
a few miles east of where you are.

03:43.640 --> 03:45.427
<i>It's where the people lived
who worked here.</i>

03:46.309 --> 03:48.079
<i>There's got to be
something there you can take.</i>

03:48.103 --> 03:49.103
Thank you.

04:29.561 --> 04:30.561
Dylan.

04:31.980 --> 04:34.643
You're going the wrong way. Follow me.

05:11.228 --> 05:12.264
Now!

05:32.541 --> 05:33.907
Olly olly oxen free.

05:51.268 --> 05:52.268
I just want to help.

05:52.561 --> 05:55.099
We told you we didn't want it.

05:57.941 --> 05:59.398
You never should've come here.

06:30.640 --> 06:31.972
What exactly is this thing?

06:36.438 --> 06:39.055
It's... This is my past.

06:39.900 --> 06:41.641
Then why do you have it now?

06:44.988 --> 06:46.775
It's a thing that gives me another day.

06:50.160 --> 06:52.072
You're running out of time, Annie.
We all are.

06:53.830 --> 06:54.911
It's not safe here.

06:55.582 --> 06:56.993
We made it through the first one.

06:57.083 --> 07:00.167
It could be different this time.
One day, the wind will blow,

07:00.253 --> 07:02.245
it'll kick up all the dirt,
all the radiation...

07:02.339 --> 07:04.296
Why can't you just leave us alone?

07:05.008 --> 07:07.125
Why can't you just let us decide
what we want to do?

07:07.218 --> 07:08.698
Because I can't leave without knowing

07:08.762 --> 07:10.924
I did everything to try and save
your lives.

07:12.807 --> 07:14.139
Because you'll die, Annie.

07:16.061 --> 07:17.177
Or worse...

07:18.563 --> 07:19.679
you'll live.

07:20.523 --> 07:23.186
And you'll wind up killing everyone
by staying here.

07:28.114 --> 07:33.701
I know our plan, getting on that plane,
sounds crazy.

07:36.039 --> 07:39.373
But so does staying here
when you know things can get really bad.

07:42.629 --> 07:46.043
This isn't about us. This is about you.

07:47.300 --> 07:49.633
You're the one who crashed that plane
to get here.

07:50.095 --> 07:51.211
Your friend almost died

07:51.304 --> 07:54.672
so that you could get to that truck stop
for somebody who wasn't even there.

07:55.141 --> 07:58.134
We put a forest full of growlers
between us and you,

07:58.228 --> 08:00.891
and you still won't give up. Why?

08:02.023 --> 08:04.811
And don't say
it's because you want to help.

08:05.276 --> 08:06.483
It's something else.

08:08.613 --> 08:10.650
So, what is it?

08:15.120 --> 08:18.329
I have to do something good
to make up for what I did.

08:22.502 --> 08:23.709
Did you hurt people?

08:24.713 --> 08:26.170
- Yes.
- Did you kill people?

08:26.256 --> 08:27.292
Yes.

08:37.142 --> 08:40.931
But I'm right. People, places,
you don't get to hold on to any of that.

08:45.108 --> 08:47.896
I'm trying here so you don't have to
go through the things that I did.

08:48.820 --> 08:50.607
You have to know when to go, Annie.

08:50.697 --> 08:53.189
No! No, we're not going!

08:54.075 --> 08:55.316
And you're not going either.

08:55.410 --> 08:58.903
Not until we clear the bodies from you
cutting down the only thing protecting us.

08:59.664 --> 09:03.783
Not until we make sure
that no one follows the path you made.

09:05.045 --> 09:06.661
And if you miss your flight...

09:09.299 --> 09:10.961
that's your fault, Alicia.

09:19.350 --> 09:20.932
How long has it been leaking?

09:21.978 --> 09:24.311
We must have put a hole
in the tank when we moved it.

09:25.899 --> 09:27.106
Shit.

09:30.361 --> 09:31.361
Shit.

09:37.160 --> 09:38.160
Shit.

09:38.244 --> 09:40.611
But aren't we standing
on a giant gas tank?

09:41.915 --> 09:43.781
It's not the same. We need aviation fuel.

09:49.881 --> 09:52.339
I think I know where we can get some.
Yeah.

10:55.530 --> 10:56.896
<i>Morgan, do you copy?</i>

10:59.200 --> 11:00.486
Yeah, Alicia, I'm here.

11:01.661 --> 11:02.661
You all right?

11:03.663 --> 11:04.904
Yeah. Yeah, I am.

11:05.707 --> 11:06.823
<i>You find those kids?</i>

11:09.127 --> 11:10.127
Yeah.

11:11.838 --> 11:14.922
They're with me right now.
Are Strand and Charlie okay?

11:15.258 --> 11:17.545
Yeah, I'm trying to find us a car.

11:18.887 --> 11:20.469
They're still in the contaminated area?

11:20.555 --> 11:24.469
Yeah. And so am I.
But not for much longer.

11:28.771 --> 11:30.307
And what about Dorie and Dwight?

11:30.982 --> 11:32.189
Still out of range.

11:34.444 --> 11:36.151
<i>Are they gonna make it back in time?</i>

11:38.031 --> 11:39.272
They're gonna be all right.

11:40.158 --> 11:42.150
<i>You just stay safe, okay?</i>

11:42.243 --> 11:44.986
And get yourself and those kids
back to the truck stop.

11:47.040 --> 11:51.956
Morgan, I tried. We tried. I can't.

11:52.629 --> 11:53.790
No, you can.

11:54.380 --> 11:56.042
<i>I tried your way, Morgan.</i>

11:56.132 --> 11:58.670
I can't get through to them.
You should be here instead of me.

12:00.470 --> 12:03.759
No. We are both exactly where
we're supposed to be.

12:15.944 --> 12:19.108
<i>Morgan, you said we were still here
for a reason,</i>

12:19.197 --> 12:22.611
but I'm starting to wonder if this is why.

12:35.338 --> 12:37.125
Everything gets a return.

12:38.424 --> 12:39.585
And it is why.

12:41.511 --> 12:42.547
It is.

13:03.157 --> 13:04.398
Alicia...

13:06.619 --> 13:08.611
we're gonna get everybody on that plane.

13:10.540 --> 13:12.577
We're gonna do what we came here to do.

13:24.679 --> 13:26.679
You sure this is where
you saw the helicopter land?

13:26.764 --> 13:29.723
Yeah. It wouldn't have gone up there
unless it was to refuel.

13:29.809 --> 13:31.289
It's the only thing that makes sense.

13:32.020 --> 13:37.061
I'll climb up, see what's there,
and if we're lucky, lower it down to you.

13:37.859 --> 13:40.602
<i>June? June, can you hear me?</i>

13:41.738 --> 13:43.618
Yes, I'm here.
We're getting fuel for the plane.

13:44.282 --> 13:47.571
John, I've been trying to reach you.
You have to get back to the truck stop.

13:48.077 --> 13:49.443
Well, we're still a ways out.

13:49.537 --> 13:53.577
You have to get back. The power plant,
that second reactor, it might melt down.

13:54.667 --> 13:56.283
Grace says we don't have much time.

13:59.047 --> 14:00.047
Come again?

14:01.299 --> 14:02.299
Come on, baby.

14:05.053 --> 14:06.053
John?

14:12.268 --> 14:13.268
June?

14:16.022 --> 14:18.890
John! Found some.

14:19.442 --> 14:20.978
Something happened at the plant.

14:21.069 --> 14:23.189
We got to get back
so we can get the hell out of here.

14:24.614 --> 14:25.650
No, you go.

14:26.199 --> 14:28.279
You know, you've done more for me
than you needed to.

14:30.661 --> 14:31.661
Thank you.

14:33.998 --> 14:35.034
Dwight...

14:35.917 --> 14:37.249
No, I got to keep looking.

14:38.086 --> 14:39.855
Look, would you
get on that plane without June

14:39.879 --> 14:41.279
if you knew she was still out here?

14:46.928 --> 14:48.009
Of course not.

14:50.264 --> 14:52.051
Okay. Come on.

14:58.523 --> 14:59.563
You think it's gonna hold?

15:00.817 --> 15:02.729
Yes. We're due for a break.

15:04.862 --> 15:08.572
You know, Daniel said every day was...
was a chance to start over.

15:09.242 --> 15:10.282
You know, to get it right.

15:11.744 --> 15:12.905
The man speaks truth.

15:15.665 --> 15:20.035
It's not going to hold them off for long.
We might not get that chance.

15:22.046 --> 15:23.046
We already have.

15:24.006 --> 15:25.006
What do you mean?

15:26.467 --> 15:29.335
I've been saying I should've been
on that plane when it flew here.

15:30.805 --> 15:34.048
I got off to clear the runway,
but the truth is...

15:35.476 --> 15:36.916
I might've been able to get back on.

15:38.187 --> 15:39.473
I had time.

15:40.690 --> 15:41.976
I hesitated.

15:43.025 --> 15:44.061
Why?

15:46.070 --> 15:47.936
Because I don't think I really believed...

15:49.198 --> 15:51.736
in it, in us.

15:52.660 --> 15:57.325
We were on the precipice
of something extraordinary, and I balked.

16:00.751 --> 16:05.246
But I'm standing here now, and so are you.

16:06.257 --> 16:11.969
And we just did something extraordinary,
and we didn't balk.

16:14.557 --> 16:15.798
And we're not gonna start now.

16:46.672 --> 16:48.629
I told you we were due for a break.

16:49.175 --> 16:50.666
Well, I see you figured it out.

16:51.427 --> 16:52.793
As did you.

16:53.804 --> 16:55.045
Where's the propellers?

16:55.139 --> 16:56.175
In there.

16:57.350 --> 16:58.761
I gotta get you out of here.

17:02.772 --> 17:04.434
Why did Dylan bring her to us?

17:05.525 --> 17:07.060
He still thinks she wants to help.

17:07.151 --> 17:09.268
I mean, she does want to help.

17:09.362 --> 17:10.603
She's a mess.

17:13.574 --> 17:15.656
The plane could still work, right?

17:15.742 --> 17:18.486
I told Mom and Dad I would keep you safe.

17:18.579 --> 17:21.195
They want us to get into a plane
that they already crashed.

17:22.666 --> 17:23.907
We stay here, we stay safe.

17:26.921 --> 17:27.921
Shit.

17:32.885 --> 17:34.171
Come on.

18:24.520 --> 18:25.556
What are you doing?

18:30.693 --> 18:32.275
Did you draw these, Dylan?

18:38.117 --> 18:42.782
You're scared, aren't you?
What's out there? Dylan, it's okay.

18:58.262 --> 18:59.548
I drew them before.

19:01.682 --> 19:04.049
At the beginning,
when everything started to happen.

19:05.478 --> 19:08.812
I had nightmares about playing red rover
with Max and Annie.

19:09.690 --> 19:12.728
Annie saw them,
and she thought they were scary.

19:13.527 --> 19:18.022
She thought if she can make them real,
it would scare away the others too,

19:18.783 --> 19:20.820
so nobody else could bother us here.

19:23.829 --> 19:25.491
But you're living in a nightmare.

19:27.333 --> 19:28.949
Your nightmare, Dylan.

19:30.878 --> 19:32.335
Everything's a nightmare now.

19:41.430 --> 19:43.296
You know, it wasn't always like that.

19:46.185 --> 19:48.222
I sharpened it after I lost my mom.

19:52.233 --> 19:55.442
It kept me safe from the dead,
but it also kept the living away.

19:57.071 --> 20:02.738
I thought if they were scared of me,
maybe they would leave me alone.

20:06.997 --> 20:08.738
But I was the one who was scared.

20:11.043 --> 20:12.409
<i>Olly olly oxen free!</i>

20:13.462 --> 20:14.953
<i>Hurry! They followed us!</i>

20:18.134 --> 20:19.134
Hurry!

20:19.218 --> 20:20.299
Open the door!

20:51.333 --> 20:52.494
No!

21:01.552 --> 21:02.963
<i>Morgan for Grace.</i>

21:05.222 --> 21:08.386
You were right. There was a truck,
and we got what we need.

21:12.146 --> 21:13.682
Is the generator working?

21:13.773 --> 21:17.392
It wasn't strong enough.
It drew too much current.

21:17.902 --> 21:20.645
Burnt it out. I'm sorry.

21:24.825 --> 21:26.782
How long before the reactor melts down?

21:27.787 --> 21:30.154
Twelve hours, maybe a day.

21:35.377 --> 21:36.993
So we'll finish the plane by then.

21:37.338 --> 21:40.081
I can fix the generator.
I can still buy you time.

21:42.259 --> 21:43.591
Is that the truth, Grace?

21:45.137 --> 21:46.423
Can you really do that?

21:46.514 --> 21:51.384
It might be the truth.
I can try. I have to try.

21:55.731 --> 21:58.769
I'll meet you at the truck stop
when I'm done. You copy?

22:01.153 --> 22:03.987
Yeah. Yeah, I copy.

22:09.078 --> 22:10.078
Morgan?

22:10.871 --> 22:14.160
Truck stop is about ten miles from here.
It's marked on this map.

22:15.042 --> 22:16.874
You shower, you change your clothes,

22:16.961 --> 22:19.544
you help Luciana get those on,
and I'll meet you there.

22:19.630 --> 22:21.371
- She said she was coming back.
- She did.

22:22.132 --> 22:23.589
But she was just saying that.

22:24.885 --> 22:27.002
I was in her house, Victor.
I saw who she was...

22:28.180 --> 22:30.547
when she still thought
she had something left to live for.

22:33.978 --> 22:37.767
Get back, finish the plane.
I'll meet you there soon as I can.

22:38.315 --> 22:40.102
- You better.
- Yeah.

22:40.860 --> 22:41.860
Come on.

22:54.832 --> 22:56.744
Should get us over the mountains.

22:57.751 --> 22:58.979
It's less than we came in with,

22:59.003 --> 23:01.871
but if we strip everything
from the plane...

23:01.964 --> 23:04.331
It'll get us there.
Everything we're doing,

23:04.425 --> 23:06.508
the fact that you knew
where to find these...

23:07.344 --> 23:09.586
it all points to us being able to do this.

23:15.227 --> 23:16.889
John, can you hear me?

23:20.274 --> 23:21.731
John, are you on your way back?

23:24.528 --> 23:25.528
John?

23:30.284 --> 23:32.196
Went over a year without seeing him.

23:34.413 --> 23:37.121
Hearing his voice. Nothing.

23:39.126 --> 23:40.617
Not gonna let that happen again.

23:43.923 --> 23:44.959
Al?

23:47.009 --> 23:49.797
You asked if I wanted to talk about
what happened while I was missing.

23:52.765 --> 23:53.765
I do.

23:54.850 --> 23:57.888
But you can't tell anyone what I tell you.

23:59.647 --> 24:00.728
Okay.

24:14.787 --> 24:15.994
I met someone.

24:19.875 --> 24:21.912
Who? When?

24:23.003 --> 24:27.464
While I was gone, I met someone, and...

24:30.386 --> 24:32.924
I felt something
I haven't felt in a long time.

24:38.727 --> 24:40.309
But I can never see her again.

24:41.355 --> 24:44.393
I can never... talk to her.

24:46.360 --> 24:48.443
And I don't know how...

24:52.324 --> 24:54.316
I don't know how to live with that.

24:57.955 --> 24:59.742
When I left John at the cabin...

25:01.333 --> 25:03.199
when I thought
I would never see him again...

25:06.171 --> 25:07.287
I felt...

25:10.259 --> 25:11.625
I felt gone.

25:12.845 --> 25:16.054
Like I wasn't who I was
when I was with him, because I wasn't.

25:16.140 --> 25:17.381
I was just this...

25:20.519 --> 25:21.680
this ghost.

25:23.522 --> 25:26.310
And I couldn't talk about it.
And even if I had,

25:26.400 --> 25:29.768
there's nothing I could've said
or something someone else could've said

25:29.862 --> 25:31.273
that would've made it any better.

25:31.697 --> 25:32.697
Sure.

25:34.074 --> 25:36.691
What do you say to someone
who's missing a piece of themself?

25:40.914 --> 25:42.701
A piece that makes them who they are?

25:49.631 --> 25:51.088
I will tell you one thing.

25:53.427 --> 25:55.589
The thing I told myself every single day.

25:56.513 --> 25:57.629
What's that?

25:58.849 --> 26:00.306
That even if I never...

26:07.024 --> 26:09.186
Even if I never saw him again...

26:11.695 --> 26:13.436
I would always be grateful...

26:14.865 --> 26:16.276
for what we had...

26:18.118 --> 26:19.609
for who I could be.

26:21.246 --> 26:27.743
That I could still feel that way
for someone after everything...

26:29.671 --> 26:33.290
that that could even exist in this world
at all...

26:35.427 --> 26:37.293
that I would always have that.

26:38.472 --> 26:39.804
And I knew I would.

26:48.732 --> 26:51.941
But I choose to believe...

26:53.695 --> 26:57.609
that whoever she is,
you will see her again.

27:02.538 --> 27:03.538
Well...

27:04.790 --> 27:06.372
I know you'll see John again.

27:09.211 --> 27:12.704
Oh, I know that.
Sure as shit, I know that.

27:29.731 --> 27:30.938
How many rounds do you have?

27:34.111 --> 27:35.111
How many?

27:35.904 --> 27:39.068
None. The guns aren't loaded.

27:41.743 --> 27:42.743
Let me help you.

27:42.828 --> 27:43.944
It'll hold.

27:44.037 --> 27:45.653
- Annie...
- We put them there.

27:45.747 --> 27:47.830
- Yeah, one by one.
- We can deal!

27:47.916 --> 27:50.124
- All of our gear is out there!
- He's right.

27:50.669 --> 27:52.376
We can't stop that many growlers.

27:52.462 --> 27:54.169
I can. Just give me the weapon.

27:54.256 --> 27:55.296
- No.
- I tried to tell you

27:55.340 --> 27:57.694
why you should come with us,
I understand why you don't believe me,

27:57.718 --> 27:59.300
but this... this I can do.

28:03.432 --> 28:06.721
Annie, she's right.
You didn't see her after the plane crash.

28:06.810 --> 28:11.430
She can help. Annie, please.
She can give us a chance. Let her.

28:12.357 --> 28:14.189
That's how you keep us safe.

28:29.499 --> 28:30.580
No, you keep it.

28:43.347 --> 28:45.384
I'll be on channel 9.
Do you have another way down?

28:45.474 --> 28:46.474
No.

28:46.558 --> 28:49.596
Start working on one.
I'll hold them off. Go!

28:49.686 --> 28:50.802
- All right, go.
- Go, go.

29:14.127 --> 29:15.163
We're out.

29:15.754 --> 29:16.754
Well, we'll find more.

29:17.130 --> 29:20.419
There's no time.
We got to raise June or we're up a creek.

29:22.511 --> 29:23.843
Well, what about that?

29:38.902 --> 29:39.902
Come on.

29:45.033 --> 29:46.649
Come on.

29:52.666 --> 29:56.000
It's all right.
You know, we can walk if we have to.

30:04.553 --> 30:07.170
See, these mountains...

30:07.806 --> 30:11.174
She may have made it across.
You know, we can too.

30:12.853 --> 30:14.310
I think that'd take days.

30:14.396 --> 30:16.604
- Yeah.
- And it doesn't sound like we have days.

30:18.066 --> 30:19.182
I think...

30:21.236 --> 30:23.444
I think I may have got us
in some trouble.

30:24.823 --> 30:26.280
What are you talking about?

30:28.410 --> 30:32.199
Remember when you asked me
if I found anything in Sherry's car,

30:32.289 --> 30:33.746
and I said no?

30:37.586 --> 30:38.872
I lied to you.

30:43.925 --> 30:45.006
I found this.

31:02.569 --> 31:03.776
I'm sorry, Dwight.

31:06.490 --> 31:07.571
I'm sorry.

31:43.610 --> 31:44.817
Grace.

31:50.742 --> 31:51.983
What are you doing here?

31:55.288 --> 31:58.872
You might not know how much time
you have left, but you are not dead yet.

31:59.543 --> 32:03.082
So... I'm not gonna
let you act like you are.

32:26.069 --> 32:27.109
How's it going down there?

32:28.697 --> 32:29.778
We need more time.

33:34.679 --> 33:35.795
No...

33:44.523 --> 33:45.523
Come on!

33:47.108 --> 33:48.269
They're getting past her!

33:56.159 --> 33:57.159
Shit.

34:05.210 --> 34:06.210
Back away!

34:22.768 --> 34:23.850
Are you okay?

34:25.355 --> 34:26.846
Yeah. You?

34:34.447 --> 34:35.654
This isn't gonna work.

34:42.038 --> 34:44.324
I can't stop them like this.
I can't do what I said.

34:46.376 --> 34:47.617
I'll come up.

34:47.710 --> 34:49.668
<i>No. They need you.</i>

34:50.338 --> 34:52.670
Annie, I know
you don't want to leave this place,

34:52.757 --> 34:54.168
but you'll die if you stay.

34:55.051 --> 34:57.543
<i>You have to know when to go,
when to let go.</i>

34:58.763 --> 35:00.220
<i>Get them on the plane, let go.</i>

35:01.850 --> 35:03.466
That's how you protect them.

35:08.231 --> 35:12.225
I don't know what you did,
but I know you made up for it.

35:12.652 --> 35:13.893
<i>You can let go too.</i>

35:24.122 --> 35:25.158
Let's go!

35:25.790 --> 35:27.531
Come on. Come on. Come on.

35:39.012 --> 35:40.799
All right!

35:41.890 --> 35:42.971
Come on!

35:45.310 --> 35:46.517
Let's go!

36:00.492 --> 36:01.903
You all right?

36:01.993 --> 36:04.138
We are, provided you point us
in the direction of a shower

36:04.162 --> 36:05.162
and some fresh clothes.

36:06.247 --> 36:07.247
Morgan?

36:07.332 --> 36:09.812
He had to attend to another matter.
He assured me he'd be here.

36:10.502 --> 36:11.618
I'm sure he will.

36:13.963 --> 36:16.046
Didn't give you
much of a choice back there.

36:18.718 --> 36:19.959
Did what I had to do.

36:20.637 --> 36:22.003
You weren't wearing a dosimeter.

36:22.639 --> 36:24.847
We don't know how much radiation
you've been exposed to.

36:29.562 --> 36:31.144
I've tried to fix things I couldn't.

36:32.565 --> 36:34.682
And I've almost died trying too.

36:35.902 --> 36:40.567
Man who helped me when I was stuck,
his name was Eastman. He...

36:42.784 --> 36:45.777
taught me something
that helped me get unstuck.

36:48.623 --> 36:52.583
He taught me that all life is precious.

36:57.006 --> 36:58.463
How'd you know I'd leave?

36:58.550 --> 37:01.714
I didn't. I just had to take the chance.

37:05.014 --> 37:10.055
Eastman taught me something else
about... redirection.

37:11.479 --> 37:14.438
You didn't think your own life
was worth saving, so...

37:15.900 --> 37:17.892
I made it about my life.

37:23.074 --> 37:24.281
What if I hadn't left?

37:26.244 --> 37:28.076
I did not think of that.

37:33.752 --> 37:35.914
So you have the same problem as I do.

37:36.004 --> 37:37.120
Which is what?

37:38.715 --> 37:41.583
You think everyone else's life
is more valuable than yours.

37:58.777 --> 38:00.313
Nice work.

38:00.403 --> 38:01.610
We're not done yet.

38:02.489 --> 38:03.821
Let's get to work.

38:21.382 --> 38:24.591
I assume these are your friends
prone to intestinal fortitude.

38:34.145 --> 38:38.685
Annie, Dylan, Max,
this is Victor and Charlie.

38:43.363 --> 38:45.901
<i>The Little Prince</i>, it was your book.

38:47.826 --> 38:50.068
Yeah. Yeah, it was.

38:53.164 --> 38:54.325
You came back.

38:55.750 --> 38:58.584
Alicia. She was pretty convincing.

38:59.504 --> 39:01.837
She usually is. Where is she now?

39:05.009 --> 39:06.009
Still out there.

39:32.787 --> 39:34.653
I bet you're not too happy with me.

39:37.292 --> 39:38.954
Well, I ain't too happy with me either.

39:41.754 --> 39:46.124
Before, you said you liked how the world
hadn't got its hooks in me or twisted me.

39:48.636 --> 39:51.128
Well, I don't think
I'm worthy of that compliment after today.

39:54.392 --> 39:56.634
No, I know why you did it.

39:59.147 --> 40:00.809
You wanted to keep me going.

40:02.191 --> 40:04.308
It doesn't have to be the end of the road.

40:08.907 --> 40:11.194
Yeah, she didn't want me looking for her.

40:22.670 --> 40:25.913
"Find something to live for and live."

40:33.598 --> 40:34.964
I don't want to give it up.

40:38.436 --> 40:40.428
Even if she's telling me to stop.

40:43.650 --> 40:49.817
But if I do what she says,
if I find a reason...

40:52.742 --> 40:54.608
You know, I had to find her.

40:54.702 --> 40:57.445
I had to make it right
after all the shit I did.

40:59.040 --> 41:01.908
So maybe I'll go out there
like you and June do.

41:03.044 --> 41:05.878
When I'm out there, maybe I'll...

41:09.968 --> 41:11.175
She's alive.

41:11.678 --> 41:12.678
Oh, yeah.

41:13.137 --> 41:14.878
Impossible shit happens.

41:14.973 --> 41:16.259
It happened for me.

41:17.308 --> 41:19.345
It happened for me when I helped someone.

41:20.728 --> 41:22.560
I think it's time I help you.

41:25.900 --> 41:28.062
I'm gonna get you back to June.

41:42.458 --> 41:43.915
<i>Alicia, can you hear me?</i>

41:46.170 --> 41:47.411
<i>Hey, are you there?</i>

41:52.427 --> 41:53.668
I'm here, Morgan.

41:56.139 --> 41:57.346
And you're all right?

42:05.440 --> 42:06.476
I'm okay.

42:10.278 --> 42:11.394
But I...

42:12.071 --> 42:15.280
I picked up a pack of walkers.
I think I lost them.

42:15.867 --> 42:17.153
Luciana told us.

42:18.161 --> 42:22.872
But the kids, Alicia, they're back
at the truck stop. You did it.

42:24.834 --> 42:26.166
And Grace?

42:26.252 --> 42:27.413
<i>We're on our way back.</i>

42:29.964 --> 42:31.125
Good.

42:31.215 --> 42:34.049
<i>I was thinking about what you said
about why we're still standing,</i>

42:34.135 --> 42:35.671
and I think you might be right.

42:36.763 --> 42:40.097
I think us helping people
isn't the only reason.

42:42.810 --> 42:43.891
You know?

42:45.438 --> 42:47.976
In trying to make up
for the lives we took,

42:48.066 --> 42:50.649
I think we stopped living our own.

42:51.486 --> 42:52.943
We are gonna get back.

42:54.030 --> 42:56.272
<i>And we're gonna keep on
finding people to help,</i>

42:57.033 --> 42:58.695
but we're also gonna help ourselves.

43:01.746 --> 43:05.410
We're gonna find a way
to start living, Alicia. Okay?

43:09.504 --> 43:10.665
You're right. We will.

43:16.594 --> 43:17.926
So tell me where you are.

43:31.359 --> 43:32.395
Is that...?

43:32.485 --> 43:33.485
Yes.
