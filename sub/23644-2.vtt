WEBVTT

00:10.827 --> 00:13.228
I am in pain.

00:13.230 --> 00:16.431
She just knocked
the...out of me.

00:16.433 --> 00:18.267
It's coming after
my mom.

00:18.269 --> 00:19.902
I think they want
to kill me.

00:21.471 --> 00:23.105
Her head's being bashed in.

00:23.107 --> 00:25.474
She closed her eyes
and never opened them again.

00:27.044 --> 00:30.312
It would not be good to have
living children around her.

00:30.314 --> 00:31.780
She's like, "I want to hate,

00:31.782 --> 00:34.483
I want to hurt,
I want to destroy."

00:35.586 --> 00:38.253
Panic, panic, panic.

00:38.255 --> 00:40.255
My name is Amy Allan.

00:40.257 --> 00:42.191
I'm seeing, like, blood.

00:42.193 --> 00:45.127
The house just feels bad.

00:45.129 --> 00:46.628
I see dead people.

00:46.630 --> 00:51.233
This man is completely insane.

00:51.235 --> 00:54.069
I speak to dead people.

00:54.071 --> 00:56.571
Okay, she didn't
like it in there.

00:56.573 --> 00:58.407
And they speak to me.

00:58.409 --> 01:00.375
He likes to twist that knife.

01:00.377 --> 01:03.912
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

01:03.914 --> 01:06.949
Something paranormal
is trying to kill them.

01:07.718 --> 01:09.151
I rely on my partner.

01:09.153 --> 01:10.619
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

01:10.621 --> 01:12.988
I'm a retired New York City
homicide detective.

01:12.990 --> 01:14.456
Now, does he die right
there on the spot?

01:14.458 --> 01:18.527
I know every person,
every house has secrets.

01:18.529 --> 01:21.096
I think it's trying
to steal my soul.

01:21.098 --> 01:22.965
It's my job
to reveal them.

01:22.967 --> 01:25.100
You ever get touched
like that again?

01:25.102 --> 01:26.935
But Steve and I never speak...

01:26.937 --> 01:29.004
We never communicate
during an investigation.

01:29.006 --> 01:30.539
...until the very end.

01:30.541 --> 01:32.374
I'm as stunned
as you guys are.

01:32.376 --> 01:34.476
We uncover it's
safe for you to stay...

01:34.478 --> 01:36.945
I don't want anything to
happen to my daughter.

01:36.947 --> 01:38.513
Or time to get out.

01:38.515 --> 01:41.516
His goal is to kill you guys.

01:43.000 --> 01:49.074

01:54.465 --> 01:55.998
I'm in Berlin Heights, Ohio.

01:56.000 --> 01:58.801
It's a small suburb about
an hour west of Cleveland.

01:58.803 --> 02:00.669
I got a call from a young
woman named Brittany.

02:00.671 --> 02:04.206
She says the house she grew up
in was a paranormal war zone.

02:04.208 --> 02:06.108
She and her sister
got the hell out,

02:06.110 --> 02:08.008
but her mom doesn't
want to leave.

02:08.011 --> 02:09.411
Brittany says if we can't help,

02:09.413 --> 02:11.680
her mother's going to
get seriously hurt.

02:14.885 --> 02:16.185
Before Amy arrives,

02:16.187 --> 02:19.488
I have to remove any
leading information.

02:19.490 --> 02:22.691
This home has a lot
of family photos

02:22.693 --> 02:25.293
and religious symbols,
so it's important

02:25.295 --> 02:27.563
that I cover or remove them all.

02:29.300 --> 02:31.300
When I'm done,
the location will be ready

02:31.302 --> 02:33.435
for tonight's walk.

02:45.282 --> 02:47.849
I don't like this.

02:47.851 --> 02:52.187
I see all these black,
like, vines growing

02:52.189 --> 02:54.056
all over the land here.

02:55.526 --> 03:00.028
They literally are embedded
into the house from the ground.

03:01.031 --> 03:05.267
They're carrying bad water
and it's bad earth.

03:06.837 --> 03:10.872
And it affects the living.
These vines make people evil.

03:18.148 --> 03:20.148
So, Brittany,
when we spoke on the phone,

03:20.150 --> 03:22.050
sounded like you were
pretty desperate.

03:22.052 --> 03:23.252
What the hell's
going on?

03:23.254 --> 03:26.555
Something's been
going after my mom.

03:26.557 --> 03:28.690
She's already been
physically hurt,

03:28.692 --> 03:30.025
and I'm worried that
it's just going

03:30.027 --> 03:32.227
to get worse from here.

03:32.229 --> 03:34.829
Now, Brittany, I know you don't
live in the house anymore,

03:34.831 --> 03:35.998
but who exactly does?

03:36.000 --> 03:38.333
So, my sister and I,
we grew up here,

03:38.335 --> 03:40.435
but we've
since moved out.

03:40.437 --> 03:41.570
Okay.

03:41.572 --> 03:43.605
Right now, currently,
my mom and dad.

03:43.607 --> 03:46.841
When you did live here,
did you have experiences?

03:46.843 --> 03:48.910
Yeah,
since day one.

03:48.912 --> 03:51.146
Most nights,
I'd cry myself to sleep.

03:51.148 --> 03:52.380
What about your sister?

03:52.382 --> 03:54.449
Yeah, it was just
as bad for her.

03:54.451 --> 03:56.318
So, I'm curious,
does coming back here

03:56.320 --> 03:57.785
bother you at all?

03:57.787 --> 04:00.722
Yes. I have a little
8- month-old,

04:00.724 --> 04:03.024
and I don't want
anything to hurt her.

04:03.026 --> 04:04.526
Do me a favor.
Can you give me an idea

04:04.528 --> 04:06.161
what everybody's
experiencing here?

04:06.163 --> 04:09.063
We've heard
lots of footsteps.

04:09.065 --> 04:09.931
Okay.

04:09.933 --> 04:12.801
We have objects moving.

04:12.803 --> 04:15.604
We've seen apparitions.

04:15.606 --> 04:17.940
There's dark shadows.

04:17.942 --> 04:19.074
And now it's gotten
to the point

04:19.076 --> 04:21.810
where people are getting
physically harmed.

04:21.812 --> 04:23.078
When you said,
"physical attacks,"

04:23.080 --> 04:24.212
what are we
talking about?

04:24.214 --> 04:27.649
My mom, she ended up
getting bit one night.

04:27.651 --> 04:31.887
She was upstairs in bed,
and she saw this lady.

04:31.889 --> 04:33.354
And she ended up
biting her,

04:33.356 --> 04:35.891
and then there was
also bruises.

04:35.893 --> 04:37.292
She actually
saw somebody --

04:37.294 --> 04:39.127
Yeah.
And then that person bit her?

04:39.129 --> 04:40.328
Yeah.

04:40.330 --> 04:42.630
In 140, some-odd cases,
I've never heard

04:42.632 --> 04:44.032
of somebody actually
seeing the apparition,

04:44.034 --> 04:45.566
and then the apparition
bit them.

04:45.568 --> 04:46.701
Yeah.

04:46.703 --> 04:48.770
How's your mom holding up
with all this going on?

04:48.772 --> 04:51.373
Most days, she's okay,
but some days,

04:51.375 --> 04:53.008
she gets
shaken up by it.

04:53.010 --> 04:55.376
My sister,
she had mentioned,

04:55.378 --> 04:58.013
that she's been shorter
with her recently.

04:58.015 --> 04:59.647
What do you think
is here?

04:59.649 --> 05:00.849
I know that
they're negative --

05:00.851 --> 05:01.849
Right.

05:01.851 --> 05:03.317
And I know
that they're bad.

05:03.319 --> 05:05.353
It's coming after
my mom.

05:05.355 --> 05:07.588
It just wants
to hurt her.

05:13.997 --> 05:15.797
Here.

05:17.267 --> 05:18.266
It's okay.

05:22.406 --> 05:25.073
So there's
a dead woman out here.

05:25.075 --> 05:27.608
She died. It was not good.
It was bad.

05:27.610 --> 05:29.711
And her head's being bashed in.

05:31.682 --> 05:34.549
The black vines might
be what's bringing her

05:34.551 --> 05:35.483
to this property.

05:35.485 --> 05:37.251
I don't know.

05:37.253 --> 05:40.088
Problem is is that these things
go into the house

05:40.090 --> 05:41.289
and affect the living.

05:41.291 --> 05:43.958
They can make them
extremely depressed.

05:43.960 --> 05:46.328
It's bad, it's bad.

05:51.301 --> 05:52.434
Okay, so what's
going on in here?

05:52.436 --> 05:53.901
Lots of dark shadows.

05:53.903 --> 05:56.638
There's one specific
that comes to mind.

05:56.640 --> 05:59.174
It was like
a snake-like figure.

05:59.176 --> 06:00.642
Where exactly was it?

06:00.644 --> 06:03.979
It came from the ceiling
and followed me up the stairs,

06:03.981 --> 06:05.580
and then it disappeared.

06:05.582 --> 06:07.282
Okay, so anything else?

06:07.284 --> 06:09.851
Yeah, so I hear running
around my bedroom,

06:09.853 --> 06:12.254
running around the hallways,
and then also,

06:12.256 --> 06:14.322
footsteps
up in the attic.

06:14.324 --> 06:18.493
Tormented me most of
my upbringing here.

06:18.495 --> 06:22.564
I would cry myself to
sleep a lot of the nights.

06:22.566 --> 06:23.731
Okay, anything else?

06:23.733 --> 06:26.134
Outside of the garage,
I saw an apparition

06:26.136 --> 06:29.571
of a young girl wearing
all white, and brown hair.

06:29.573 --> 06:33.208
She came off more negative,
and almost vengeful.

06:33.210 --> 06:36.010
So this young girl
scared you?

06:36.012 --> 06:37.079
Yeah.

06:37.081 --> 06:39.981
It seemed like she could
do something to hurt me.

06:43.753 --> 06:47.889
I got a dead little girl
between the age of 4 and 5.

06:47.891 --> 06:50.425
She's wearing a little
blue and white dress,

06:50.427 --> 06:52.594
white stockings, white shoes.

06:52.596 --> 06:55.096
I don't know what
her connection is

06:55.098 --> 06:57.632
to this place specifically.

06:57.634 --> 06:59.968
All I know is that she's here.

07:01.104 --> 07:04.139
Really adorable kid,
really cute.

07:04.141 --> 07:06.741
Cutie, but she's not good.

07:08.312 --> 07:12.046
And I saw her transform,
and it was bad.

07:12.048 --> 07:15.784
Yeah, this kid is causing
all kinds of commotion.

07:15.786 --> 07:17.786
There's always --
she's always running,

07:17.788 --> 07:21.089
she's always on the go,
she's always go, go, going.

07:22.292 --> 07:23.925
She's like a little tornado.

07:23.927 --> 07:28.263
I think that they would
hear a child running a lot.

07:28.265 --> 07:32.800
She's very hyper kid,
and she does a lot of things

07:32.802 --> 07:34.569
that kids would do.

07:34.571 --> 07:38.540
Like this towel, she would pull
down, and she bites people.

07:39.476 --> 07:44.846
She's very mean -- biting legs,
pulling on people, spazzing.

07:50.386 --> 07:51.586
Talking to your sister,
Brittany, earlier,

07:51.588 --> 07:52.721
and she was telling me

07:52.723 --> 07:54.589
how traumatic it was
growing up here.

07:54.591 --> 07:57.492
It was very scary,
very nerve-wracking.

07:57.494 --> 07:58.860
This is my old room.

07:58.862 --> 08:00.428
It makes me
very, very uncomfortable,

08:00.430 --> 08:02.097
and I won't come
in here by myself.

08:02.099 --> 08:04.299
Can you tell me about some of
the experiences you had?

08:04.301 --> 08:06.134
Probably the scariest
thing for me --

08:06.136 --> 08:09.504
all my drapes started to go
up an down at the same time.

08:09.506 --> 08:10.505
Were any windows open?

08:10.507 --> 08:11.840
No.

08:11.842 --> 08:13.275
Now that's like something
out of a horror movie?

08:13.277 --> 08:14.109
Yes.

08:14.111 --> 08:15.510
Okay, anything else?

08:15.512 --> 08:17.111
I used to sleep
with the radio on

08:17.113 --> 08:18.580
to tune out the noises.

08:18.582 --> 08:22.250
Every night, my radio
station would change,

08:22.252 --> 08:24.252
and I'd wake up
to ballroom music.

08:24.254 --> 08:26.454
So you go to bed with one
station on, wake up to another?

08:26.456 --> 08:28.156
Yep, pretty much.

08:28.158 --> 08:30.058
It was a bad experience.

08:31.795 --> 08:32.928
Boy.

08:32.929 --> 08:35.730
Mostly just the kid in here
running amok.

08:35.732 --> 08:41.436
She causes a lot of chaos
and physical disturbances,

08:41.438 --> 08:43.205
throughout the house.

08:43.207 --> 08:46.208
I think the kid can
play with energy,

08:46.210 --> 08:51.513
so there would be
some light issues...

08:52.782 --> 08:55.283
...television issues,

08:55.285 --> 08:57.552
computer issues down here.

08:57.554 --> 08:59.887
She might mess
with the curtains

08:59.889 --> 09:02.724
or the couch or the chair.

09:02.726 --> 09:04.426
She is crazy.

09:07.564 --> 09:09.497
Your sister mentioned to me,
that you thought

09:09.499 --> 09:10.898
your mother had a change
in her personality.

09:10.900 --> 09:12.067
Can you tell me
about that?

09:12.069 --> 09:15.436
She's just more standoffish.
She's irritated.

09:15.438 --> 09:17.205
She's short.
She's just not the same.

09:17.207 --> 09:19.540
It's not the mom
I grew up with.

09:19.542 --> 09:21.376
Do you think it's the
paranormal in this house?

09:21.378 --> 09:23.144
I do.
It's like they're, like,

09:23.146 --> 09:25.113
sucking the life
out of her.

09:25.115 --> 09:26.380
Your sister thinks
she's in danger.

09:26.382 --> 09:27.449
What do you think?

09:27.451 --> 09:28.850
I think that something
could really,

09:28.852 --> 09:31.218
potentially, hurt her.

09:31.220 --> 09:32.420
Okay.

09:34.924 --> 09:37.592
This little girl
is a big problem.

09:37.594 --> 09:40.962
She can be malicious
towards the living.

09:40.964 --> 09:44.498
She was trying to
bind me with the vines.

09:44.500 --> 09:47.302
I feel like she tries to
make people stay here

09:47.304 --> 09:49.937
or not be able to leave here.

09:50.741 --> 09:53.208
And tries to infect them
with the vines.

09:53.210 --> 09:56.611
And what would being
infected with these vines do?

09:56.613 --> 10:00.015
Could cause somebody
to kill themselves

10:00.017 --> 10:01.816
or get sick, I guess.

10:02.886 --> 10:04.085
And then what?

10:04.087 --> 10:05.854
Die?

10:24.974 --> 10:26.408
Well, Tammy,
I was talking to

10:26.410 --> 10:28.676
your daughter, Brittany,
who asked us to come in,

10:28.678 --> 10:30.612
and she's pretty worried
about you.

10:30.614 --> 10:32.747
She thinks you're
in danger here.

10:32.749 --> 10:33.748
Do you agree with her?

10:33.750 --> 10:36.217
Yes, it's gotten
very bad.

10:36.219 --> 10:37.818
At first, it wasn't
that threatening,

10:37.820 --> 10:39.286
but the last
few years it's --

10:39.288 --> 10:41.355
I feel like
we're in danger.

10:41.357 --> 10:42.924
Both your daughters
gave me a laundry list

10:42.926 --> 10:44.959
of experiences
they've had.

10:44.961 --> 10:46.193
Yes.
Okay, what about you?

10:46.195 --> 10:48.095
We have
a lot of knocking.

10:48.097 --> 10:49.831
It'll sound like
it's knocking on doors.

10:49.833 --> 10:51.766
It'll be
knocking on walls.

10:51.768 --> 10:54.302
Sometimes it sounds like
there's 100 people,

10:54.304 --> 10:56.571
beating on the outside
of our house.

10:57.974 --> 10:59.874
What about pipes?
No.

10:59.876 --> 11:03.077
I've come down to make sure
that's not what it was.

11:03.079 --> 11:04.178
Anything else?

11:04.180 --> 11:06.647
We have constant
shadow people.

11:06.649 --> 11:08.516
I see them every day.

11:08.518 --> 11:09.917
Now, Brittany
mentioned to me

11:09.919 --> 11:12.921
she sees snake-like
shadow figures.

11:12.923 --> 11:13.988
What do you see?

11:13.990 --> 11:15.256
They're dark.

11:15.258 --> 11:17.658
Like a person,
but they're spread out.

11:17.660 --> 11:19.560
I see them
come down the steps.

11:19.562 --> 11:21.729
They like to go
across the ceiling.

11:21.731 --> 11:23.597
And I'll wake up,
and they'll be above you,

11:23.599 --> 11:27.268
and it feels like they're
trying to suck your breath.

11:27.270 --> 11:28.937
Feels like
I can't get any air.

11:28.939 --> 11:30.939
What do you think
these things want?

11:30.941 --> 11:32.940
Well, I think they
want to kill me.

11:38.815 --> 11:41.082
Feels very
oppressive down here.

11:41.084 --> 11:44.519
This is a very painful place
to live in physically.

11:45.488 --> 11:47.455
Feels like I'm drowning.

11:48.725 --> 11:51.626
There's a male associated
with this space.

11:51.628 --> 11:55.196
He doesn't want to be seen,
doesn't want to be known.

11:58.301 --> 12:00.502
Okay, he does do
the black mist thing.

12:00.504 --> 12:03.238
People do see a black
shadow person down here.

12:04.508 --> 12:06.441
He really does try
to push his energy,

12:06.443 --> 12:07.609
and push you out.

12:07.611 --> 12:10.144
People are hearing
loud noises down here,

12:10.146 --> 12:12.680
like loud crashes,
bangs, whatever.

12:19.122 --> 12:21.689
I feel like he's grabbing the
back of my neck, like a doll.

12:21.691 --> 12:24.258
I am in pain.

12:24.260 --> 12:26.193
People would feel him.

12:26.195 --> 12:28.496
I'm feeling like they
need to get out of here

12:28.498 --> 12:30.231
as quickly as possible.

12:37.007 --> 12:38.606
Okay, so what's
going on up here?

12:38.608 --> 12:40.174
My health
has been declining.

12:40.176 --> 12:42.810
I feel pains all across
the left side of my body,

12:42.812 --> 12:45.480
in my knee, and in my shoulder,
and the back of my neck.

12:45.482 --> 12:47.414
Why do you think your health
problems are paranormal?

12:47.416 --> 12:50.618
I've been to the doctor,
and the pain that I'm having,

12:50.620 --> 12:54.121
there's no medical issue
that goes along with it.

12:54.123 --> 12:55.356
Anything else?

12:55.358 --> 12:57.091
I woke up with
a bite mark on my arm.

12:57.093 --> 13:00.094
Okay, your daughter,
Brittany, told me about that.

13:00.096 --> 13:02.096
Yes, and I've also
woken up with bruises.

13:02.098 --> 13:03.665
I have a picture
right here.

13:05.969 --> 13:07.569
I'll wake up,
and it's on my limbs.

13:07.571 --> 13:09.237
They're quite large.

13:09.239 --> 13:11.705
Now, these bruises hurt?
Yes.

13:11.707 --> 13:13.508
And there's no autoimmune
disease problem, or --

13:13.510 --> 13:15.310
No.
Okay.

13:15.312 --> 13:16.978
No.
Anything else?

13:16.980 --> 13:19.047
Well, I saw an apparition
of a lady

13:19.049 --> 13:20.448
right in
the hallway here.

13:22.418 --> 13:23.984
She was in
Victorian clothing,

13:23.986 --> 13:26.054
and she was probably,
like, about 30 years old.

13:26.056 --> 13:29.323
Did you ever see an apparition
like that again?

13:29.325 --> 13:32.459
Yes, I woke up, startled,
and it was a lady

13:32.461 --> 13:33.528
floating above me.

13:33.530 --> 13:35.463
She was all white
and translucent.

13:35.465 --> 13:37.398
Was it the same lady, though?
No.

13:37.400 --> 13:39.200
Can you describe the woman
you saw above the bed?

13:39.202 --> 13:41.803
Yes. She was
probably like, 50s.

13:41.805 --> 13:44.338
And she had all
this frizzy hair,

13:44.340 --> 13:46.340
and she was completely
white, also.

13:46.342 --> 13:48.142
Do you think she's
the one who attacked you?

13:48.144 --> 13:49.410
Yes.

13:49.412 --> 13:52.547
The first lady was peaceful,
and this one was evil.

13:52.549 --> 13:53.814
Your daughter
Mandy told me

13:53.816 --> 13:55.817
that your personality's
changed a little bit.

13:55.819 --> 13:56.651
Do you agree with that?

13:56.653 --> 13:57.885
I would, yeah.

13:57.887 --> 13:59.687
You know,
not feeling that great.

13:59.689 --> 14:01.488
I'm really drained
all the time.

14:01.490 --> 14:03.358
It's getting worse.

14:03.360 --> 14:04.626
This is probably hard
for you to hear,

14:04.628 --> 14:07.629
but Brittany was telling me,
that she's kind of worried

14:07.631 --> 14:08.896
about bringing
her daughter here.

14:08.898 --> 14:10.364
Yeah, that's
very painful.

14:10.366 --> 14:12.232
We want to know she's safe
when she's here

14:12.234 --> 14:15.236
and not have to worry about
anything attacking her

14:15.238 --> 14:17.238
or hurting her,
so we went to the best,

14:17.240 --> 14:18.840
we went to you guys.

14:24.380 --> 14:27.982
There's a woman who
is a raging lunatic.

14:27.984 --> 14:30.418
She's pissed, man.

14:30.420 --> 14:32.319
Does she affect
the living in any way?

14:32.321 --> 14:33.655
I'm not sure
how they see her.

14:33.657 --> 14:35.789
She doesn't
let anybody sleep.

14:35.791 --> 14:38.793
She's trying to talk to
people all the time.

14:38.795 --> 14:40.061
Whoa.

14:40.063 --> 14:42.430
She just knocked
the...out of me.

14:44.134 --> 14:48.202
So she is extremely physical,
and I think she'd hurt them.

14:48.204 --> 14:51.906
Hitting them, choking them,
smothering them in their beds.

14:53.877 --> 14:56.544
I would be nervous about
kids being around her, too.

14:56.546 --> 14:58.146
I think it would not be good

14:58.148 --> 15:01.182
to have living children
around her -- at all.

15:01.184 --> 15:03.751
This dead woman would
beat living children.

15:03.753 --> 15:06.788
The other thing she's doing,
is draining my energy.

15:07.157 --> 15:10.491
I think living people
would probably have nausea,

15:10.493 --> 15:15.263
anxiety, like feel
irritable, anxious, sleepy,

15:15.265 --> 15:16.597
things like that.

15:16.599 --> 15:18.900
And she's like,
"I want to hate, I want to hurt,

15:18.902 --> 15:20.701
I want to destroy."

15:38.037 --> 15:40.037
Amy and I have already
done a few investigations

15:40.039 --> 15:41.673
in this part of Ohio,
so I've got a bunch

15:41.675 --> 15:43.341
of local contacts here.

15:43.343 --> 15:45.276
One of them,
my old friend Kim Macdonald,

15:45.278 --> 15:48.379
says one of the original owners
of the house has a tragic story

15:48.381 --> 15:50.748
that's definitely gonna
help my investigation.

15:55.588 --> 15:56.854
Well, Kim, It's good
to see you again.

15:56.856 --> 15:59.189
- Good to see you.
- So you mentioned on the phone

15:59.191 --> 16:01.392
the Elson family
had a pretty tragic story.

16:01.394 --> 16:02.727
What can you
tell me about them?

16:02.729 --> 16:07.465
The Elsons, Joseph and Luticia,
moved into the area,

16:07.467 --> 16:09.567
with their
12 children in tow.

16:09.569 --> 16:10.801
Wow.

16:10.803 --> 16:14.238
In 1874, they moved
into the house

16:14.240 --> 16:16.674
that your clients
live in right now.

16:16.676 --> 16:18.008
Now, you also
mentioned on the phone

16:18.010 --> 16:19.610
that things got bad when
they moved here.

16:19.612 --> 16:21.779
What happened?
Yes, three years later,

16:21.781 --> 16:28.019
in 1877, their daughter Julia
developed a blood infection

16:28.021 --> 16:29.587
and she died.

16:29.589 --> 16:31.122
And how old was she
at the time of her death?

16:31.124 --> 16:33.857
She was 33,
prime of her life.

16:33.859 --> 16:36.193
Now, Kim, do we have any idea
what caused this infection?

16:36.195 --> 16:40.598
All it says on the death
record is septicemia and fever.

16:40.600 --> 16:44.735
They move there, Julia dies.
What happens after that?

16:44.737 --> 16:48.339
Three years after
Julia dies, Maggie,

16:48.341 --> 16:50.674
she also comes up with

16:50.676 --> 16:53.877
the very same
type of infection,

16:53.879 --> 16:58.449
and Maggie died
in February of 1880.

16:58.451 --> 16:59.349
In the house?

16:59.351 --> 17:01.552
In the house.

17:01.554 --> 17:04.454
Here is her
death record.

17:04.891 --> 17:06.523
Okay, now, how old was
Maggie when she died?

17:06.526 --> 17:08.626
She was 33.

17:08.627 --> 17:11.095
So we got two sisters
the same age, 33 years old,

17:11.097 --> 17:13.696
dying of
the same disease.

17:13.699 --> 17:14.565
Right.

17:14.567 --> 17:15.900
How'd Luticia take this?

17:15.902 --> 17:18.535
Luticia did not
handle it well.

17:18.537 --> 17:20.905
The same year that
she lost Maggie,

17:20.906 --> 17:23.708
Luticia's health
started to go downhill,

17:23.710 --> 17:26.777
Luticia developed edema,
which is like

17:26.779 --> 17:29.046
a swelling under the skin,
it's very painful.

17:29.048 --> 17:30.948
Doctor gave her
some morphine,

17:30.950 --> 17:33.117
try to ease the pain.

17:33.119 --> 17:34.585
She overdosed.

17:34.587 --> 17:38.856
So, November, 1880,

17:38.858 --> 17:41.792
she closed her eyes
and never opened them again.

17:41.794 --> 17:43.060
Here's her obituary.

17:43.062 --> 17:46.196
She was 71
when she died.

17:46.198 --> 17:48.666
Luticia's funeral
was actually held

17:48.668 --> 17:50.668
in your client's house.

17:54.807 --> 17:59.076
I'm trying to get something
on that woman who attacked me.

17:59.078 --> 18:00.578
So she lived here
with her husband

18:00.580 --> 18:03.881
who she...hated
with...a passion.

18:03.883 --> 18:05.349
This is going back.

18:05.351 --> 18:07.618
I mean, she's talking
about 1870s.

18:07.620 --> 18:09.987
She doesn't like children,
but she had kids.

18:13.326 --> 18:17.061
I feel like her kids died.

18:17.063 --> 18:20.898
There's been quite a few
deaths surrounding her.

18:20.900 --> 18:22.333
Any idea
how she died?

18:22.335 --> 18:24.936
I'm seeing a woman
falling to the floor.

18:27.440 --> 18:30.574
I just feel very sick
and light-headed here.

18:30.576 --> 18:31.775
I feel like I'm gonna fall down.

18:31.777 --> 18:35.179
I feel dizzy,
I feel weak, I feel heavy.

18:35.181 --> 18:37.848
She took medicine?

18:37.850 --> 18:40.785
Maybe took too much,
I don't know.

18:40.787 --> 18:43.454
So far I've got a client
worried something's going after

18:43.456 --> 18:46.724
her mom on a property
where one of the original owners

18:46.726 --> 18:49.260
suffered several tragic deaths.

18:49.262 --> 18:51.395
But I want to see if
there's anything else.

18:51.397 --> 18:54.798
Searching through old records,
I come across Hudson Tuttle.

18:54.800 --> 18:56.600
Turns out Tuttle claimed
to be a medium

18:56.602 --> 18:59.270
and lived right down the street
from Tammy's property.

19:00.139 --> 19:02.139
I'm heading over to meet
with a local historian

19:02.141 --> 19:04.775
who says this Tuttle guy
was a real piece of work.

19:11.017 --> 19:12.483
Mary, thanks for meeting me.

19:12.485 --> 19:15.052
So, what'd you find out
about Hudson Tuttle?

19:15.054 --> 19:18.756
He was born in
Berlin Heights in 1836.

19:18.758 --> 19:20.691
When he was
just 19 years old,

19:20.693 --> 19:23.094
he wrote a book
on psychic phenomenon.

19:23.096 --> 19:26.029
He became well-known
as a medium,

19:26.031 --> 19:29.300
not just in the town,
but all over the world.

19:29.302 --> 19:31.234
Was he very active
in this town?

19:31.236 --> 19:35.506
Yes, he went around town
and held seances.

19:35.508 --> 19:38.175
Tuttle wanted to
help other people,

19:38.177 --> 19:40.043
to communicate
with the dead.

19:40.045 --> 19:42.913
So he actually
invented something

19:42.915 --> 19:44.715
that was similar
to a Ouija board,

19:44.717 --> 19:46.684
and it's called
the psychograph.

19:46.686 --> 19:50.654
And it was a device used
to communicate with the dead.

19:50.656 --> 19:51.656
Of course,
then they used them

19:51.658 --> 19:54.191
all over the area
of Berlin Heights.

19:54.193 --> 19:56.327
People had them
in their home.

19:56.329 --> 19:57.595
You know,
so working with Amy,

19:57.597 --> 20:00.464
I know that doing that
Ouija board stuff

20:00.466 --> 20:02.866
in one house
is bad enough,

20:02.868 --> 20:06.537
but if he's doing it
throughout the whole town,

20:06.539 --> 20:07.804
that can't be good.

20:07.806 --> 20:09.073
It might be
a stab in the dark,

20:09.075 --> 20:11.008
but the Elson family
lived down the street

20:11.010 --> 20:13.143
in my client's house
around that time.

20:13.145 --> 20:14.612
Any idea
if he knew them?

20:14.614 --> 20:16.547
Yes, he knew
the Elsons,

20:16.549 --> 20:18.816
and he must have
known them pretty well

20:18.818 --> 20:21.819
because I found
this article.

20:21.821 --> 20:26.223
When the Elson's daughter
Maggie died in 1880,

20:26.225 --> 20:28.326
he conducted
the funeral services.

20:28.328 --> 20:29.693
He did
the funeral service?

20:29.695 --> 20:32.830
Yes, and he was very
close to the family.

20:32.832 --> 20:34.031
Any chance
that the Elsons

20:34.033 --> 20:35.499
would have had something
like psychographs?

20:35.501 --> 20:37.701
I would say it's
a high probability

20:37.703 --> 20:39.036
that they did have one.

20:39.038 --> 20:40.237
So whatever
happened with him?

20:40.239 --> 20:42.639
Hudson Tuttle, he stayed
in Berlin Heights.

20:42.641 --> 20:44.108
He lived there
his whole life,

20:44.110 --> 20:48.512
and he died of kidney disease,
nephritis, in 1910,

20:48.514 --> 20:51.448
when he was 74 years old.

20:51.450 --> 20:53.917
And the interesting
thing is that he's buried

20:53.919 --> 20:57.221
just about 100 yards
from your client's property.

20:59.192 --> 21:01.992
There's an old man,
white beard, mustache,

21:01.994 --> 21:05.429
tall and thin, pale,
age 65.

21:05.431 --> 21:07.597
Like, I feel like
maybe he was born here,

21:07.599 --> 21:10.167
and that evil got
right into him right away.

21:13.739 --> 21:16.640
I wonder if those vines
made him turn bad.

21:16.642 --> 21:21.545
Just that the vines
extend very far.

21:24.283 --> 21:27.351
And I'm afraid
that they can kill.

21:34.026 --> 21:36.227

21:53.229 --> 21:55.796
You know, another thing
caught my attention in research.

21:55.798 --> 21:58.632
There used to be a cult near the
house that Brittany grew up in,

21:58.634 --> 22:01.201
and one of its members killed
himself right on the grounds.

22:01.203 --> 22:02.603
So I'm heading over
to meet my old buddy,

22:02.605 --> 22:04.471
retired detective, Tom Armelli,

22:04.473 --> 22:06.740
who's looking into
this case for me.

22:13.715 --> 22:15.149
I know this kid
committed suicide

22:15.151 --> 22:16.683
right near my client's property,

22:16.685 --> 22:19.386
but before we get to that, what
do you know about this kid?

22:19.388 --> 22:21.121
Well, his name was
Charles Latcha.

22:21.123 --> 22:22.456
He was 19 years old.

22:22.458 --> 22:23.791
He comes
to Berlin Heights

22:23.793 --> 22:26.460
to join this
free-love commune.

22:26.462 --> 22:29.396
That sounds like some
kind of "woo-woo" crap.

22:29.398 --> 22:31.932
How close was this place
to my client's property?

22:31.934 --> 22:33.133
It's probably
about 800 feet

22:33.135 --> 22:36.036
from the property that
you're looking at.

22:36.038 --> 22:37.805
What happens with
this kid Charles?

22:37.807 --> 22:40.674
Charles Latcha was
a printer by trade,

22:40.676 --> 22:42.143
and when he came
to the commune,

22:42.145 --> 22:43.811
they appointed him
to be in charge

22:43.813 --> 22:44.744
of their newspaper.

22:44.746 --> 22:46.013
What was this
group all about?

22:46.015 --> 22:48.282
They gave up all their
worldly possessions,

22:48.284 --> 22:50.084
they disavowed
their marriages.

22:50.086 --> 22:52.653
The place became a magnet
for single women,

22:52.655 --> 22:55.055
widows, divorcees,
and the like.

22:55.057 --> 22:57.091
It was more or less
like a hippie commune

22:57.093 --> 22:58.792
of this time period.

22:58.794 --> 22:59.927
Sounds like a cult.

22:59.929 --> 23:01.228
By today's definitions,

23:01.230 --> 23:02.929
that's probably
exactly what it was.

23:02.931 --> 23:05.900
Did the community
buy into this?

23:05.902 --> 23:07.901
The Berlin Heights residents
did not take kindly

23:07.903 --> 23:10.938
to this group of free-lovers
living in their town.

23:10.940 --> 23:12.773
One of the things
they did was they attacked

23:12.775 --> 23:14.374
the wagons that were
delivering the newspapers,

23:14.376 --> 23:15.576
that Latcha
had printed.

23:15.578 --> 23:18.112
They wouldn't allow
the free-lovers' kids

23:18.114 --> 23:19.779
to attend school
in Berlin Heights.

23:19.781 --> 23:21.014
There actually came
a point in time

23:21.016 --> 23:23.116
where the sheriff did
make several arrests

23:23.118 --> 23:25.452
and charged some
of the free-lovers

23:25.454 --> 23:28.656
with various
sex-related crimes.

23:28.658 --> 23:30.724
They were all eventually
released with the agreement

23:30.726 --> 23:33.127
that they would leave the
county and not come back.

23:33.129 --> 23:35.128
From this point on,
the commune dwindled down

23:35.130 --> 23:36.830
to very few members,

23:36.832 --> 23:38.932
Charles being one
of the last holdouts.

23:38.934 --> 23:41.068
Most of the community is gone,
but Charles stayed behind.

23:41.070 --> 23:42.403
What happened?

23:42.405 --> 23:45.539
On June 22nd, 1858,
Charles obtains a gun.

23:45.541 --> 23:47.107
After he penned
his suicide note,

23:47.109 --> 23:50.277
he shot himself in the chest
at his print shop.

23:50.279 --> 23:52.079
There were witnesses there
that I was able

23:52.081 --> 23:53.547
to communicate with,
and at the time,

23:53.549 --> 23:55.549
he was very upset,
he was cursing God,

23:55.551 --> 23:58.218
cursing marriage, cursing
the whole free-love commune,

23:58.220 --> 24:00.287
and that was the end.

24:00.289 --> 24:02.623
Here's a copy of
Charles's suicide note

24:02.625 --> 24:07.761
that he printed in
the free-love newspaper.

24:07.763 --> 24:10.464
Wow, he went out
really bitter

24:10.466 --> 24:11.331
about the whole thing.

24:11.333 --> 24:12.600
Yes.

24:16.038 --> 24:19.240
These vines affect
the living in horrible ways.

24:19.242 --> 24:21.341
And I know that vines
carry heavy depression,

24:21.343 --> 24:24.178
so it could cause somebody
to kill themselves.

24:26.749 --> 24:30.584
I'm thinking this may have
happened to a male nearby.

24:30.586 --> 24:34.054
He says, "It doesn't
matter, I didn't matter,

24:34.056 --> 24:37.725
nothing matters," and, um...

24:40.129 --> 24:43.063
I see a shotgun.

24:43.065 --> 24:45.065
It's very graphic, it's bad.

24:45.067 --> 24:47.434
It's just, blech.

24:56.812 --> 24:58.412
I saw several
disturbing things

24:58.414 --> 25:01.415
during my walk,
but two stood out.

25:01.417 --> 25:04.451
First, the vines that
turn people evil.

25:04.453 --> 25:07.354
They're thicker,
almost like arteries.

25:07.356 --> 25:10.424
They're all over
the ground, alive,

25:10.426 --> 25:13.360
but melded with the house.

25:13.362 --> 25:14.361
Okay.

25:14.363 --> 25:16.563
Next I described
the psycho woman

25:16.565 --> 25:19.867
beating a living person
in a bedroom upstairs.

25:20.369 --> 25:23.504
There was a female
in the bed, scared,

25:23.506 --> 25:26.106
trying to pretend that
this is not happening.

25:26.108 --> 25:30.176
Behind her is this dead woman

25:30.178 --> 25:34.615
who has extremely long brown
hair, and she has no face.

25:43.258 --> 25:45.325
Amy, is this
what you saw?

25:45.327 --> 25:47.127
Yes, that's what I saw.

26:06.264 --> 26:09.099
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations,

26:09.101 --> 26:11.568
we're ready to reveal our
findings to each other

26:11.570 --> 26:13.837
and our clients
for the first time.

26:14.940 --> 26:18.275
Well, Amy, this is Brittany
and her mother Tammy.

26:18.277 --> 26:19.843
Now, Brittany grew
up in this house,

26:19.845 --> 26:21.912
and she says the paranormal
activity here

26:21.914 --> 26:24.515
made her childhood
a living hell.

26:24.517 --> 26:27.351
She called us in because
now that she's moved out,

26:27.353 --> 26:29.486
whatever's here is
going after her mom.

26:29.488 --> 26:31.254
Both of them are
convinced it's dangerous,

26:31.256 --> 26:32.923
and if you can't
find a way to fix it,

26:32.925 --> 26:34.791
Tammy's going to wind up
seriously hurt

26:34.793 --> 26:36.927
or, God forbid, dead.

26:36.929 --> 26:38.795
Now that Amy knows
a little bit about you guys,

26:38.797 --> 26:41.098
I'm gonna ask her to
describe her walk for us.

26:43.970 --> 26:48.238
When I got here, I saw
a male who committed suicide.

26:48.240 --> 26:51.641
I heard a gunshot,
and I heard this male saying,

26:51.643 --> 26:54.812
"Nothing matters,
I don't matter."

26:54.814 --> 26:56.913
And that was in
the backyard area.

26:56.915 --> 26:59.850
Later on, I walked
down into the basement

26:59.852 --> 27:02.619
and I ran into
the same dead male.

27:02.621 --> 27:05.388
Boy, was he pissed.

27:05.390 --> 27:09.226
I could not get anything,
history-wise,

27:09.228 --> 27:15.199
concerning this male because
he did not want me down there.

27:16.601 --> 27:18.268
There was a pretty
interesting suicide

27:18.270 --> 27:19.536
right near here, actually.

27:19.538 --> 27:21.104
The guy who killed
himself was a 19-year-old

27:21.106 --> 27:22.572
named Charles Latcha.

27:22.574 --> 27:24.908
Charles came to Berlin Heights
to join the cult

27:24.910 --> 27:27.377
the free-love commune
in the 1850s.

27:27.379 --> 27:29.646
Now, the commune bought
up about 90 acres in town

27:29.648 --> 27:32.983
and set up their headquarters
just about 800 feet from here.

27:32.985 --> 27:35.585
Now, back in that time,
this area was pretty religious.

27:35.587 --> 27:37.320
People didn't like
what was going on,

27:37.322 --> 27:39.056
so them, along with
the sheriff, wind up

27:39.058 --> 27:41.525
running most of
the cult members out of town.

27:41.527 --> 27:44.061
Latcha was pretty broken up
about the cult falling apart

27:44.063 --> 27:45.195
because it's all he had,

27:45.197 --> 27:46.730
and he fell into
a serious depression.

27:46.732 --> 27:51.268
Now, on June 22, 1858,
he shot himself in the chest.

27:51.270 --> 27:53.236
Okay, I got a suicide note here.

27:53.238 --> 27:55.338
It's tough to read,
but basically in the note,

27:55.340 --> 27:57.207
he talked about how much
he hated marriage,

27:57.209 --> 27:58.542
and everything else
for that matter.

27:58.544 --> 28:00.744
Wow.

28:00.746 --> 28:03.012
Can he interact with
the living at all?

28:03.014 --> 28:06.483
Yes. His energy is
extremely consuming.

28:06.485 --> 28:08.952
If he's around,
then you're feeling

28:08.954 --> 28:11.989
the anxiety and the need
to get the hell out of there

28:11.991 --> 28:13.356
as quickly as possible.

28:13.358 --> 28:15.025
The other thing
that he likes to do

28:15.027 --> 28:17.027
is to make
a lot of noise.

28:17.029 --> 28:19.563
So you hear loud banging,
crashing sounds.

28:19.565 --> 28:21.932
He can get physical
with the living.

28:21.934 --> 28:24.000
He got me from behind,

28:24.002 --> 28:27.438
just grabbed my neck
and was squeezing super hard.

28:27.440 --> 28:29.038
I think the living
would experience

28:29.040 --> 28:31.041
neck pain from him.

28:31.043 --> 28:32.976
Do you think it
has to do with

28:32.978 --> 28:34.611
my neck pain
that I always have?

28:34.613 --> 28:36.246
Yeah, definitely.

28:36.248 --> 28:37.647
Tammy, do me a favor.

28:37.649 --> 28:39.783
Tell Amy about the banging
and knocking sounds you hear.

28:39.785 --> 28:40.851
It's very scary.

28:40.853 --> 28:42.719
It's usually down,
like, underneath

28:42.721 --> 28:46.557
the step area,
is where it's intense.

28:46.559 --> 28:48.926
Growing up, we used
to always run up there

28:48.928 --> 28:51.528
feeling like something's
gonna grab you.

28:53.933 --> 28:57.267
- So what else?
- There's this little girl

28:57.269 --> 28:58.802
from hell.

28:58.804 --> 29:03.407
She's definitely one of the most
active dead people here.

29:04.609 --> 29:06.643
She's about 4 or 5 years old.

29:06.645 --> 29:08.879
I saw her wearing, like,
a little blue dress,

29:08.881 --> 29:10.480
little pig tails.

29:10.482 --> 29:14.651
She looks innocent, but she
has an evil element to her.

29:14.653 --> 29:17.353
She has a lot of energy.

29:17.756 --> 29:20.591
She's like a little tornado,
constantly running.

29:20.593 --> 29:22.159
Running, running,
running like a maniac.

29:22.161 --> 29:24.561
Yes.
Yeah, running up and down

29:24.563 --> 29:26.163
the stairs,
around the room.

29:26.165 --> 29:27.698
Interesting.

29:27.700 --> 29:29.566
She likes to grab
and pull on things

29:29.568 --> 29:31.235
that are within her reach,

29:31.237 --> 29:33.570
and also she'll
affect electronics --

29:33.572 --> 29:37.040
TVs, radios, lights,
things like that.

29:37.042 --> 29:39.509
She can get really physical
with the living,

29:39.511 --> 29:41.712
and one of the things
she kept doing to me was

29:41.714 --> 29:43.780
punching my kidneys
and stuff,

29:43.782 --> 29:45.649
just punch, punch,
punch, punch, punch.

29:45.651 --> 29:48.919
So I think that people
would have lower back pain.

29:48.921 --> 29:50.387
Well, some of the experiences
you're talking about

29:50.389 --> 29:51.788
these guys
have been having.

29:51.790 --> 29:53.390
Brittney, talk about
the little girl you saw

29:53.392 --> 29:54.725
you told me about.

29:54.727 --> 29:58.061
The little girl we saw
was outside of the garage,

29:58.063 --> 30:00.230
and she was
wearing a white gown,

30:00.232 --> 30:01.665
and brown hair.

30:01.667 --> 30:03.366
Amy, Brittney's
sister, Mandy,

30:03.368 --> 30:04.568
told me that
her radio stations

30:04.570 --> 30:06.203
used to get
changed randomly.

30:06.205 --> 30:08.805
They'd
randomly change from

30:08.807 --> 30:11.341
alternative rock
to what sounds like

30:11.343 --> 30:15.012
what you'd be in
the elevator listening to.

30:15.014 --> 30:16.613
Wow.

30:16.615 --> 30:18.015
Mandy also had an experience
with the drapes

30:18.017 --> 30:19.783
going up and down
in her bedroom.

30:19.785 --> 30:21.018
Would that be this kid?
Yeah.

30:21.020 --> 30:22.119
Wow.

30:26.491 --> 30:31.161
So now I'm upstairs,
and I ran into a dead woman.

30:31.163 --> 30:33.363
What I got with her
is that she lived here

30:33.365 --> 30:35.465
with her husband
and her children.

30:35.467 --> 30:37.601
She looked
very well dressed,

30:37.603 --> 30:41.705
very well put together,
but she's nasty.

30:41.707 --> 30:44.608
This was between
1860-1870.

30:44.610 --> 30:47.511
She is mentally unstable.

30:47.513 --> 30:52.715
She hated her husband
and their children.

30:52.717 --> 30:54.952
She doesn't like children,
but she had kids.

30:57.790 --> 31:01.825
I feel like her kids died.

31:01.827 --> 31:05.229
There's been quite a few
deaths surrounding her.

31:05.231 --> 31:06.997
Also, she either
killed herself

31:06.999 --> 31:09.666
or she wanted
to kill herself.

31:09.668 --> 31:12.035
It's not much to go on,
but based on the time period

31:12.037 --> 31:13.737
I have an idea of who
you might've seen.

31:13.739 --> 31:15.739
Now, her name
was Luticia Elson.

31:15.741 --> 31:17.074
She and her
husband Joseph

31:17.076 --> 31:19.743
bought and moved into
this house in 1874.

31:19.745 --> 31:21.011
Now, they were
both farmers

31:21.013 --> 31:22.279
and raised
12 children together.

31:22.281 --> 31:23.947
Holy...

31:23.949 --> 31:26.182
I don't know anything
about Luticia

31:26.184 --> 31:28.451
hating her kids,
but her times in the house

31:28.453 --> 31:29.753
were hard,
I can tell you that much.

31:29.755 --> 31:32.222
In 1877, her adult
daughter Julia

31:32.224 --> 31:33.556
died from a blood infection.

31:33.558 --> 31:35.225
She was 33 years old.

31:35.227 --> 31:38.662
I got her death record.

31:38.664 --> 31:40.596
Now, just three years
after that,

31:40.598 --> 31:43.633
Luticia's daughter Maggie got
sick with a similar infection.

31:43.635 --> 31:45.936
She died right here
in the house in 1880.

31:47.305 --> 31:48.905
Just three years later.
How old was she?

31:48.907 --> 31:50.340
33.

31:50.342 --> 31:51.508
Interesting.

31:51.510 --> 31:53.643
I go there death record
here, as well.

31:53.645 --> 31:54.778
You can imagine
it's pretty devastating

31:54.780 --> 31:56.546
for a mother
to lose two kids.

31:56.548 --> 31:59.283
Not long after Maggie died,
Luticia's health went bad.

31:59.285 --> 32:02.452
Luticia suffered from edema,
which is a very painful thing

32:02.454 --> 32:04.854
that makes
the body tissues swell.

32:04.856 --> 32:07.490
The doctor gave her
morphine to ease her pain.

32:07.492 --> 32:10.627
Now, at some point, she
overdosed on morphine and died.

32:10.629 --> 32:13.563
She died here when
she was 71 years old.

32:13.565 --> 32:15.866
This is the record
about her death.

32:15.868 --> 32:19.136
Luticia's funeral was also
held here in the house in 1880.

32:19.138 --> 32:21.004
Is it even possible
that's who you saw?

32:21.006 --> 32:23.440
I'm leaning more towards
maybe one of her daughters

32:23.442 --> 32:28.745
because this woman
hated children.

32:28.747 --> 32:29.846
Hated them.

32:29.848 --> 32:32.516
She still hates them.

32:32.518 --> 32:34.050
Maggie had no kids.

32:34.052 --> 32:36.887
Well, that would
make sense.

32:36.889 --> 32:38.821
Does she do anything
to these guys?

32:38.823 --> 32:40.023
Yes.

32:40.025 --> 32:41.691
Her energy is
extremely intense

32:41.693 --> 32:43.026
and very overwhelming.

32:43.028 --> 32:45.429
Being around her upstairs
you would feel

32:45.431 --> 32:48.498
extremely anxious,
irritable, and nauseous.

32:48.500 --> 32:51.101
She drains you, so she
can drain you like that.

32:52.304 --> 32:54.270
I don't feel like
I ever get to sleep

32:54.272 --> 32:56.639
because I'm drained
all the time.

32:56.641 --> 32:59.576
The other thing
that she does,

32:59.578 --> 33:01.511
possibly you would
see her,

33:01.513 --> 33:03.013
and I saw
a younger woman.

33:03.015 --> 33:04.514
I would put her --

33:04.516 --> 33:07.584
I would've put her
in her 20s or 30s.

33:07.586 --> 33:10.920
The thing that really
bothered me about her

33:10.922 --> 33:13.323
is that she can be
extremely physical,

33:13.325 --> 33:15.392
and that gets down
to hitting, choking,

33:15.394 --> 33:18.161
and attacking the living
in your bed.

33:18.163 --> 33:20.730
I saw an apparition
of a young lady.

33:20.732 --> 33:25.268
She was, like, 20,
in a Victorian dress.

33:25.270 --> 33:27.070
But at the time, to me,
it was peaceful.

33:27.072 --> 33:28.738
It didn't scare me.

33:28.740 --> 33:30.873
And then
I woke up startled,

33:30.875 --> 33:33.142
and there was
a lady above me

33:33.144 --> 33:37.214
and she was all white
with all this frizzy hair,

33:37.216 --> 33:41.284
and when I got up,
I had a bite mark on my arm.

33:41.286 --> 33:43.353
She was older,
she was like 50s.

33:43.355 --> 33:44.888
Interesting.

33:44.890 --> 33:48.658
Now, I got a photo of
the bite mark right here.

33:48.660 --> 33:50.660
Aw, geez.

33:51.763 --> 33:54.164
She also wakes up
with bruises.

33:54.166 --> 33:55.498
Okay.

33:55.500 --> 33:57.434
All right, so this bite,
the bruise,

33:57.436 --> 33:59.502
and feeling drained,
is this all from

33:59.504 --> 34:00.737
this woman
you're talking about?

34:00.739 --> 34:01.605
Yeah.

34:03.375 --> 34:08.110
I'm gonna show you something
that I saw in a sketch.

34:12.317 --> 34:14.117
Geez.

34:17.723 --> 34:19.255
My God.

34:24.329 --> 34:28.164
Then there's two
ladies after me in bed?

34:28.166 --> 34:30.266
No, there's just one,

34:30.268 --> 34:33.402
but she can shift her
image to look like her.

34:33.405 --> 34:35.138
She borrows images.

34:35.139 --> 34:39.708
So it's the same woman you saw
in two different forms.

34:42.614 --> 34:44.347
I got to ask you,
you called us in because

34:44.349 --> 34:45.382
you were worried about
your mom.

34:45.384 --> 34:46.549
When you see this,

34:46.551 --> 34:47.817
I mean, what's going
through your mind?

34:47.819 --> 34:49.152
It's horrible.

34:49.154 --> 34:50.554
I don't want her
to be hurt.

34:50.556 --> 34:53.690
And because this woman
hated kids so much,

34:53.692 --> 34:55.891
I don't think this is
a safe environment

34:55.893 --> 34:58.228
for children at all.

34:58.230 --> 35:00.129
I have
a young daughter.

35:00.131 --> 35:02.699
At a loss of words,
if I'm honest.

35:04.970 --> 35:08.572
Now I'm gonna talk about
the biggest threat.

35:09.808 --> 35:11.607
So I'm out
in the backyard,

35:11.609 --> 35:14.677
and what I see are
these, like, vines.

35:14.679 --> 35:17.314
They were dark black,
and they were coming

35:17.316 --> 35:21.117
out of the ground
and engulfing the house.

35:21.119 --> 35:22.853
What worries me
about these vines

35:22.855 --> 35:25.589
is they can spread
depression and anger.

35:25.591 --> 35:26.789
You guys felt
any of that?

35:26.791 --> 35:29.525
I've felt sadness
before, randomly.

35:29.527 --> 35:32.695
Yeah, you can feel emotions
that don't make sense.

35:32.697 --> 35:34.664
It's not what you're
really feeling.

35:34.666 --> 35:37.267
I don't know if
you guys would actually

35:37.269 --> 35:40.670
see these vines,
but I did have

35:40.672 --> 35:43.273
a sketch done
of what I saw.

35:59.024 --> 36:02.759
Is there any way that
they can come inside?

36:03.695 --> 36:05.161
Yes.

36:06.665 --> 36:08.698
I think I know why Brittney's
asking you this question,

36:08.700 --> 36:11.234
because of what we talked about,
what you saw inside the house.

36:11.236 --> 36:14.571
So, we always refer
to them as "dark shadows."

36:15.507 --> 36:16.973
Because they're
like a snake

36:16.975 --> 36:18.842
and they'll go around
the ceilings

36:18.844 --> 36:20.577
and up the walls.
Wow.

36:20.579 --> 36:24.981
I see them pretty much every
day now during the day.

36:24.983 --> 36:27.651
Now the shadows they're
seeing, are those these vines?

36:27.653 --> 36:29.986
Yeah, I think so.

36:31.657 --> 36:34.391
So the vines
that are coming

36:34.393 --> 36:37.994
into the house can
carry negative energy

36:37.996 --> 36:39.395
and emotions with them,

36:39.397 --> 36:45.101
and can negatively affect
the living people inside.

36:45.937 --> 36:48.504
If you're exposed
too long to the vines,

36:48.506 --> 36:51.708
I think you would experience
suicidal thoughts,

36:51.710 --> 36:54.277
a change in
personality, anger.

36:54.279 --> 36:56.012
So, Amy, that's
one of the biggest

36:56.014 --> 36:57.280
reasons we're here.

36:57.282 --> 36:59.215
Tammy, when I talked
to your daughter Mandy,

36:59.217 --> 37:01.617
she mentioned she noticed
a change in you.

37:04.255 --> 37:05.621
That I was getting
a little bit short,

37:05.623 --> 37:06.823
a little impatient.

37:06.825 --> 37:08.758
So, could that be
from the vines?

37:08.760 --> 37:10.860
Yes.

37:10.862 --> 37:14.030
So the worst case
is that you

37:14.032 --> 37:17.367
are infected by them,
i.e. becoming ill

37:17.369 --> 37:19.703
and dying from them.

37:19.705 --> 37:23.739
I'm really surprised
at what this really is,

37:23.741 --> 37:25.842
'cause I thought for
sure it was, you know,

37:25.844 --> 37:28.244
shadow people
and real demons,

37:28.246 --> 37:29.779
so this is
kind of better.

37:29.781 --> 37:31.181
I mean.

37:35.320 --> 37:36.786
It's not good.

37:36.788 --> 37:39.122
You've got, like, one
woman who's getting you

37:39.124 --> 37:42.192
in these vines
that can kill people.

37:42.194 --> 37:46.796
Brute downstairs that can
cause you physical pain.

37:46.798 --> 37:49.065
But you think
it's not bad.

37:50.335 --> 37:52.802
You think it's better
than what it was gonna be,

37:52.804 --> 37:56.305
and there's someone
trying to kill you.

37:56.307 --> 37:58.474
It doesn't make sense.

38:15.110 --> 38:17.110
So, Brittney, you called
us in because you thought

38:17.112 --> 38:18.979
your mother was in danger.

38:18.981 --> 38:21.314
Now it's time to address the
question you called us in for.

38:21.316 --> 38:23.516
Is it going to be safe
for your mom to stay here,

38:23.518 --> 38:24.818
or should she just pack up

38:24.820 --> 38:26.652
and get the hell out
while she can?

38:26.654 --> 38:28.722
For that answer, I'm gonna
turn it over to Amy.

38:32.694 --> 38:35.362
You can stay.

38:35.364 --> 38:37.263
But there are
quite a few things

38:37.265 --> 38:38.631
that you need to do.

38:38.633 --> 38:41.201
First, get
a physical medium.

38:41.203 --> 38:45.104
This medium needs to
come in and remove Maggie,

38:45.106 --> 38:47.040
the woman upstairs.

38:47.042 --> 38:49.175
The woman who died
at 33 in the house?

38:49.177 --> 38:50.844
Correct.
Okay.

38:50.846 --> 38:53.046
Now this is
gonna be unusual,

38:53.048 --> 38:54.780
but what I would
like you to do

38:54.782 --> 38:59.219
is to get an audience
together for her,

38:59.221 --> 39:01.821
and the medium is
gonna stand up

39:01.823 --> 39:04.590
and is going to
relay for 60 minutes

39:04.592 --> 39:08.428
the most important
things Maggie feels

39:08.430 --> 39:10.396
occurred in her life.

39:10.398 --> 39:14.000
Once that's done,
she will be moved on.

39:14.002 --> 39:16.302
So once the medium comes in
and moves Maggie on,

39:16.304 --> 39:18.070
basically, she'll
start feeling better?

39:18.072 --> 39:19.772
Well, you won't
get beat up.

39:19.774 --> 39:21.974
I'm very happy
to hear that.

39:23.044 --> 39:25.578
A few days later,
have the medium come back

39:25.580 --> 39:28.247
and try to move on
the little girl.

39:28.249 --> 39:31.518
After that, the medium
needs to go downstairs

39:31.520 --> 39:34.921
and move the male on
that's down there.

39:34.923 --> 39:36.556
This is going to take
a lot of convincing

39:36.558 --> 39:38.925
because he feels
so at home

39:38.927 --> 39:43.329
and so comfortable down there,
but it can be done.

39:43.331 --> 39:45.397
Do you recommend
having the same medium

39:45.399 --> 39:46.398
do all of it?

39:46.400 --> 39:48.067
Yeah, I do.

39:48.069 --> 39:49.602
The last thing
you need to do

39:49.604 --> 39:52.238
is kill these vines.

39:52.240 --> 39:56.108
You're going to get
a lot of tar water.

39:56.110 --> 39:58.277
You're gonna put it
in a spray bottle,

39:58.279 --> 40:00.480
and you're
gonna go outside,

40:00.482 --> 40:02.815
and where the house
meets the ground

40:02.817 --> 40:05.351
is where you're
aiming, okay?

40:05.353 --> 40:07.820
You're gonna go
along the entire outside

40:07.822 --> 40:10.957
of the house doing this.

40:10.959 --> 40:14.727
Do not miss a spot.

40:14.729 --> 40:16.362
When you're spraying
the tar water,

40:16.364 --> 40:18.898
these are
shriveling and dying.

40:18.900 --> 40:20.866
So the tar water
is gonna destroy

40:20.868 --> 40:22.702
the vines that are
coming into the house?

40:22.704 --> 40:24.904
Yes.

40:24.906 --> 40:27.540
So that's everything
you have to do.

40:27.542 --> 40:29.309
Once that's all done, though,
this house will be

40:29.311 --> 40:30.276
safe enough to live in?

40:30.278 --> 40:32.545
Yes.

40:32.547 --> 40:35.581
It'll be very quiet.

40:35.583 --> 40:37.116
Brittney, I'm curious.

40:37.118 --> 40:39.184
Would you rather see your
mother move or do all this?

40:39.186 --> 40:40.386
Be honest.

40:40.388 --> 40:42.588
If I'm 100% honest,
I don't really trust

40:42.590 --> 40:46.025
what's in the yard,
because you're gonna

40:46.027 --> 40:48.461
be around that all
the time still,

40:48.463 --> 40:50.496
and it could
still affect you.

40:50.498 --> 40:54.100
So you'd rather see
your mom and dad move?

40:54.102 --> 40:55.734
At this point, yeah,

40:55.736 --> 40:58.338
but I know her,
and she'll be stubborn

40:58.340 --> 41:02.375
and not listen when
it comes to staying here.

41:03.011 --> 41:05.544
Knowing how your daughter
feels, what are you thinking?

41:05.546 --> 41:07.146
I think we'll
do the work.

41:07.148 --> 41:12.318
We have to at least try
and see how it works.

41:12.320 --> 41:13.619
When will it be safe

41:13.621 --> 41:16.255
for Brittney to bring
her daughter around?

41:16.257 --> 41:18.858
As soon as the last thing's
been done basically,

41:18.860 --> 41:20.326
with the tar water.

41:20.328 --> 41:21.995
I think it's amazing.

41:21.997 --> 41:24.697
You really
solved everything.

41:24.699 --> 41:26.499
It's good
to have answers.

41:28.637 --> 41:31.838
Brittney and Tammy have
a lot of work ahead of them,

41:31.840 --> 41:34.340
but if they contact a medium
to remove the dead,

41:34.342 --> 41:36.776
and kill the vines
with the tar water,

41:36.778 --> 41:39.846
Tammy can stay in her home
and Brittney can find peace

41:39.848 --> 41:42.882
knowing her mother will be safe.
