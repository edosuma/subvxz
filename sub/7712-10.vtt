00:04.510 --> 00:07.482
(Pam)
W.B. JONES IS RENOVATING
THEIR OFFICES,

00:07.516 --> 00:09.152
AND THEIR CONSTRUCTION CREWS
ARE TAKING UP

00:09.186 --> 00:10.822
SOME OF THE PARKING SPACES
WE USED TO GET.

00:10.855 --> 00:11.723
(Jim)
SO WE HAD TO PARK

00:11.757 --> 00:14.062
AT A SATELLITE PARKING LOT
OVER THERE.

00:14.097 --> 00:15.265
WHICH JUST MEANS WE GET
TO SEE MORE

00:15.298 --> 00:16.800
OF OUR LOVELY STREET.

00:16.834 --> 00:18.271
TELL THEM WHAT WE SAW TODAY,
JIM.

00:18.304 --> 00:20.642
OH, TODAY WE SAW
A JUNKYARD DOG

00:20.674 --> 00:23.148
ATTACKING THE BONES
OF A ROTISSERIE CHICKEN.

00:23.180 --> 00:24.417
NATURE.

00:24.449 --> 00:26.820
I'VE BEEN HERE NINE YEARS,
AND NOW ALL OF A SUDDEN

00:26.854 --> 00:28.358
I'M SUPPOSED TO PARK
HALF A MILE AWAY.

00:28.390 --> 00:33.201
I LOST A PENNY
OUT OF MY LOAFERS, OSCAR.

00:33.235 --> 00:34.270
I WILL QUIT.

00:34.302 --> 00:36.506
AS GOD IS MY WITNESS,
I WILL QUIT

00:36.540 --> 00:37.643
IF THIS IS NOT FIXED.

00:37.676 --> 00:40.448
SOME OF US LIKE THE WALK
MORE THAN OTHERS.

00:40.481 --> 00:42.219
(Kevin)
HURTS LIKE HELL.

00:42.253 --> 00:45.225
[cheerful music]

00:45.259 --> 00:53.275
*

01:08.638 --> 01:09.572
(Pam)
DID YOU PICK A NEW CHAIR?

01:09.607 --> 01:10.709
IT'S BEEN A WHILE.

01:10.741 --> 01:13.715
PAM, WHEN I FIRST OPENED
THIS CATALOG,

01:13.747 --> 01:15.918
I THOUGHT I WAS JUST GOING
TO BE PICKING OUT A CHAIR.

01:15.952 --> 01:17.723
BUT INSTEAD YOU FOUND SOMETHING

01:17.756 --> 01:19.727
TO DISTRACT YOU
FROM EVER PICKING OUT A CHAIR.

01:19.760 --> 01:22.199
MICHAEL STARTED THE PROCESS
OF SELECTING A NEW CHAIR

01:22.233 --> 01:23.567
ABOUT THREE WEEKS AGO.

01:23.600 --> 01:24.703
AND NORMALLY I WOULDN'T CARE,

01:24.737 --> 01:26.541
BUT HE PROMISED ME
HIS OLD ONE.

01:26.573 --> 01:27.709
IT'S WAY BETTER.

01:27.743 --> 01:28.778
IT'S ONE OF THESE:

01:28.810 --> 01:30.614
[makes whooshing sound]

01:30.648 --> 01:32.219
I REALLY WANT IT.

01:33.821 --> 01:34.790
HAVE YOU EVER SEEN
THIS WOMAN?

01:34.823 --> 01:36.761
HER?
MMM.

01:36.794 --> 01:38.664
THE ONE IN THE REALLY GREAT
MESH, BLACK,

01:38.698 --> 01:40.302
HI-BACK SWIVEL CHAIR?

01:40.335 --> 01:41.670
LOOK AT HER SMILE.

01:41.704 --> 01:43.607
IT'S EYES.
LOOK AT HER EYES.

01:43.640 --> 01:47.349
SHE'S GOT--
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS EXACTLY.

01:47.383 --> 01:48.684
SHE DRESSES LIKE
A PROFESSIONAL,

01:48.718 --> 01:51.757
AND YET YOU KNOW
THERE IS A SIDE OF HER

01:51.791 --> 01:53.694
THAT COULD JUST CURL UP
ON A COUCH.

01:53.728 --> 01:55.029
OR IN A GREAT CHAIR.

01:55.062 --> 01:57.468
UH, YEAH, MAYBE, BUT...

01:57.503 --> 02:00.241
REMEMBER AFTER MY DINNER PARTY

02:00.241 --> 02:02.479
WHEN I SAID
THAT I WAS SWEARING OFF WOMEN?

02:02.512 --> 02:04.549
I DEFINITELY REMEMBER
YOUR DINNER PARTY.

02:04.583 --> 02:05.585
I THINK WHAT I MEANT

02:05.619 --> 02:08.390
WAS THAT I AM COMPLETELY
SWEARING OFF ONE WOMAN:

02:08.424 --> 02:10.729
[whispers]
JAN.

02:12.698 --> 02:15.772
I THINK THAT FATE
PUT THIS CATALOG IN MY HANDS.

02:15.804 --> 02:17.343
ACTUALLY, I PUT THE CATALOG
IN YOUR HAND

02:17.376 --> 02:18.744
'CAUSE YOU HAVE
TO PICK OUT A NEW CHAIR.

02:18.778 --> 02:20.748
WHAT IS IT LIKE BEING SINGLE?

02:20.782 --> 02:22.485
I...LIKE IT.

02:22.519 --> 02:25.023
I LIKE STARTING EACH DAY

02:25.056 --> 02:27.762
WITH A SENSE OF POSSIBILITY.

02:27.796 --> 02:29.800
AND I'M OPTIMISTIC

02:29.833 --> 02:33.038
BECAUSE EVERY DAY
I GET A LITTLE MORE DESPERATE.

02:33.073 --> 02:36.111
AND DESPERATE SITUATIONS
YIELD THE QUICKEST RESULTS.

02:36.144 --> 02:37.483
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,

02:37.516 --> 02:39.117
WOULD YOU PLEASE OPEN
YOUR SUPPLY CATALOGS

02:39.150 --> 02:42.658
AND KINDLY TURN TO PAGE 85?

02:42.692 --> 02:44.897
[phone rings]

02:44.930 --> 02:45.899
YO,

02:45.932 --> 02:47.702
IS THIS HIS NEW CHAIR?

02:47.735 --> 02:48.704
NO, HE HASN'T PICKED ONE YET.

02:48.737 --> 02:49.739
[scowls]

02:49.772 --> 02:51.844
WHEN PAM GETS MICHAEL'S
OLD CHAIR,

02:51.877 --> 02:53.615
I GET PAM'S OLD CHAIR.

02:53.647 --> 02:56.084
THEN I'LL HAVE TWO CHAIRS.

02:56.119 --> 02:58.023
ONLY ONE TO GO.

02:58.056 --> 03:00.361
I AM READY TO START DATING
AGAIN.

03:00.361 --> 03:02.765
GETTING BACK ON THE MARKET.

03:02.798 --> 03:06.806
SO FYI FOR THOSE OF YOU

03:06.840 --> 03:07.808
WHO WERE THINKING ABOUT
FIXING ME UP

03:07.842 --> 03:09.680
WITH ANY OF YOUR FRIENDS,

03:09.713 --> 03:14.790
USE THE WOMAN ON PAGE 85
AS A TEMPLATE.

03:14.822 --> 03:16.427
THAT WILL BE ALL.

03:24.477 --> 03:25.712
I LEFT MY CELL PHONE
IN MY CAR.

03:25.744 --> 03:27.449
HMM.

03:27.483 --> 03:28.585
CALL US WHEN YOU GET THERE

03:28.617 --> 03:29.819
SO WE KNOW YOU'RE OKAY.

03:34.160 --> 03:35.898
LISTEN, MAN,

03:35.932 --> 03:37.902
I AM COMPLETELY OVER JAN.

03:37.936 --> 03:41.577
SO...WOULD YOU SET ME UP?

03:41.611 --> 03:43.548
IF I HAD SOMEBODY
TO SET YOU UP WITH, MICHAEL,

03:43.581 --> 03:45.818
THEN I'D TAKE HER
FOR MYSELF.

03:45.851 --> 03:47.186
I THOUGHT YOU WERE ENGAGED.

03:47.221 --> 03:49.960
NOPE.
STACY BROKE UP WITH ME.

03:49.993 --> 03:51.863
WHAT?

03:51.896 --> 03:53.968
GOD, THAT'S TERRIBLE, MAN.

03:54.001 --> 03:57.875
AUGH, SHE'S CRAZY.

03:57.908 --> 03:58.944
UM, ARE YOU STILL
ON GOOD TERMS

03:58.978 --> 03:59.980
WITH ANY OF HER FRIENDS?

04:00.013 --> 04:01.816
NOT ANYMORE.

04:01.851 --> 04:02.953
IT'S A BIGGER SITUATION.

04:02.986 --> 04:05.525
YEAH--UGH!

04:05.559 --> 04:08.930
SHE'S--
YOU DON'T DESERVE HER.

04:08.965 --> 04:10.768
ALL RIGHT.

04:10.802 --> 04:15.142
OH, HELLO, OSCAR MEYER
WEINER LOVER.

04:15.176 --> 04:17.014
I BET THAT YOU HAVE

04:17.047 --> 04:21.691
A BUNCH OF VERY LIBERAL
GIRL-TYPE FRIENDS

04:21.723 --> 04:22.958
WHO TRUST YOU IMPLICITLY

04:22.992 --> 04:23.960
BECAUSE THEY KNOW
YOU'D NEVER TOUCH 'EM

04:23.994 --> 04:24.729
BECAUSE OF YOUR CONDITION.

04:24.763 --> 04:26.701
UM...
(Phyllis)
MICHAEL.

04:26.733 --> 04:27.836
WHAT?

04:27.868 --> 04:29.170
I HAVE A FRIEND WHO'S SINGLE.

04:29.205 --> 04:30.709
(Michael)
OH.

04:30.741 --> 04:31.876
SANDY.

04:31.911 --> 04:34.849
SHE'S GORGEOUS AND SHE'S GOT
A FEISTY PERSONALITY TOO.

04:34.882 --> 04:37.287
HMM, FEISTY.

04:37.322 --> 04:39.827
SO SHE'S NOT JOLLY OR SASSY?

04:39.859 --> 04:41.262
NOT LIKE A JOLLY,
SASSY OPERA SINGER?

04:41.295 --> 04:43.867
NO, SHE'S A PROFESSIONAL
SOFTBALL PLAYER.

04:43.900 --> 04:47.074
OOH...UGH.
CATCHER OR INFIELD?

04:47.107 --> 04:48.611
I DON'T KNOW,
MICHAEL.

04:48.645 --> 04:50.914
IS SHE A DRESS-WEARER

04:50.948 --> 04:53.186
OR A PANTS-WEARER?

04:53.219 --> 04:54.989
COULD WE SHARE A ROWBOAT?

04:55.022 --> 04:56.794
COULD A ROWBOAT SUPPORT HER?

04:56.826 --> 04:57.763
WHAT ARE YOU ASKING?

04:57.796 --> 05:00.601
I THINK I'M BEING VERY CLEAR
WHAT I'M ASKING.

05:00.601 --> 05:03.373
WOULD AN AVERAGE-SIZED
ROWBOAT SUPPORT HER

05:03.406 --> 05:06.044
WITHOUT CAPSIZING?

05:08.048 --> 05:10.020
IT BOTHERS ME THAT YOU'RE
NOT ANSWERING THE QUESTION.

05:10.052 --> 05:10.754
NO, ALL RIGHT?

05:10.788 --> 05:11.991
NO, SHE CAN'T FIT
IN A ROWBOAT.

05:12.024 --> 05:13.193
DAMN IT!
I KNEW IT!

05:13.225 --> 05:14.963
I KNEW IT, PHYLLIS.
OKAY.

05:14.997 --> 05:16.366
WHAT IS WRONG
WITH THESE PEOPLE?

05:16.399 --> 05:18.035
I WOULD DO ANYTHING FOR THEM,

05:18.068 --> 05:19.839
AND THEY'RE JUST HANGING ME
OUT TO DRY.

05:19.873 --> 05:22.011
DATING SHOULDN'T BE HARD
FOR SOMEBODY LIKE ME

05:22.043 --> 05:23.847
BUT IT IS,
AND YOU KNOW WHY?

05:23.881 --> 05:28.023
BECAUSE NOBODY HERE
IS WILLING TO HELP ME.

05:28.055 --> 05:29.992
NOTHING WOULD EVER GET DONE

05:30.027 --> 05:32.331
IN THIS OFFICE WITHOUT
A FORMAL REQUEST, WOULD IT?

05:32.364 --> 05:34.969
WELL FINE, HERE GOES.

05:35.002 --> 05:36.239
I DON'T THINK THAT THIS IS--
NOW OKAY,

05:36.272 --> 05:39.947
I KNOW THAT THIS
IS PROBABLY NOT APPROPRIATE.

05:39.979 --> 05:41.983
BUT I NEED HELP.

05:45.022 --> 05:47.494
BECAUSE I WANT TO PLAY BALL
WITH MY KIDS

05:47.527 --> 05:49.767
BEFORE I GET TOO OLD.

05:49.800 --> 05:51.403
AND BEFORE THAT HAPPENS,

05:51.435 --> 05:55.779
I NEED TO GET LAID.

05:55.812 --> 05:57.883
AND BEFORE THAT HAPPENS,
I NEED TO BE IN LOVE.

05:57.916 --> 05:59.887
AND I DON'T WANT TO HEAR

05:59.920 --> 06:00.721
"I DON'T KNOW,
I CAN'T HELP, NA NA NA."

06:00.721 --> 06:03.828
NO, NO, I AM A CATCH,

06:03.861 --> 06:05.932
AND I AM NOT GOING TO BE
THE ONE WHO GOT AWAY.

06:05.964 --> 06:09.004
SO THIS IS WHAT
WE'RE GOING TO DO.

06:09.038 --> 06:11.409
DWIGHT IS GOING TO HAND OUT
INDEX CARDS,

06:11.442 --> 06:13.947
AND I WANT YOU ALL
TO WRITE DOWN THE NAME

06:13.981 --> 06:17.054
OF AN ELIGIBLE WOMAN
FOR ME TO DATE

06:17.086 --> 06:19.090
BY THE END OF THE DAY.

06:19.125 --> 06:21.896
NO, BY THE END OF THE HOUR,

06:21.931 --> 06:24.468
OR YOU ARE FIRED.

06:24.502 --> 06:26.506
WRITE LEGIBLY, PEOPLE.

06:28.376 --> 06:29.813
BECAUSE OF THE CONSTRUCTION
AT W.B. JONES,

06:29.847 --> 06:32.084
HALF OF US HAVE TO PARK
IN THE SATELLITE LOT.

06:32.116 --> 06:33.855
IT'S, LIKE,
A 10 MINUTE WALK.

06:33.888 --> 06:35.256
NO, 30.

06:35.290 --> 06:37.126
WELL, LOOK, I HAVE AN ASSIGNED
PARKING PLACE IN FRONT,

06:37.160 --> 06:40.835
SO...ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT,
ALL RIGHT.

06:40.869 --> 06:43.038
UM, LET ME TRY TO THINK ABOUT
WHAT IT WOULD BE LIKE

06:43.073 --> 06:45.276
TO NOT HAVE ONE.

06:52.425 --> 06:54.260
OKAY, YES.
THAT WOULD BE BAD.

06:54.294 --> 06:55.531
YES.
YES.

06:55.563 --> 06:57.969
OKAY, SO...
HELP US OUT.

06:58.003 --> 06:59.270
WISH I COULD, BUT I CAN'T.

06:59.304 --> 07:00.608
WELL CAN,

07:00.640 --> 07:02.176
BUT WON'T.

07:02.211 --> 07:04.147
SHOULD, MAYBE, BUT SHORN'T.

07:04.181 --> 07:05.650
MICHAEL, PLEASE--

07:05.684 --> 07:07.054
WHAT PART OF SHORN'T
DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND, KEVIN?

07:07.086 --> 07:10.260
LOOK, I COULD PROBABLY
HANDLE IT, YES.

07:10.292 --> 07:12.531
BUT I THINK IT WOULD BE
A GOOD EXERCISE

07:12.564 --> 07:13.633
FOR YOU GUYS TO DO IT
YOURSELVES.

07:13.667 --> 07:14.501
WE WON'T LET YOU DOWN.

07:14.535 --> 07:16.673
OH, YOU CAN'T
BECAUSE I DON'T CARE.

07:16.706 --> 07:19.913
LISTEN, DON'T FORGET
TO FILL OUT THOSE CARDS.

07:19.947 --> 07:21.582
MY LOVE CARDS.

07:21.616 --> 07:23.554
THERE'S NOBODY I HATE ENOUGH

07:23.586 --> 07:25.691
TO WRITE HER NAME
ON THIS CARD.

07:25.723 --> 07:29.265
WELL, I'M SETTING MICHAEL UP
WITH MY FAT FRIEND ANYWAY.

07:29.297 --> 07:30.634
HE CAN JUST DEAL WITH IT.

07:30.667 --> 07:32.236
WHO ARE YOU PUTTING DOWN?

07:32.271 --> 07:33.238
OH, YOU DON'T KNOW HER.

07:33.272 --> 07:34.476
WHO IS IT?

07:34.509 --> 07:35.678
YOUR MOM.

07:35.710 --> 07:38.716
YEAH, WHATEVER.

07:38.749 --> 07:40.621
GIVE THAT TO ME!
GIVE THAT TO--

07:40.653 --> 07:45.999
OKAY, "WENDY:
HOT AND JUICY REDHEAD."

07:46.032 --> 07:48.570
LET'S GIVE THIS A TRY.

07:51.576 --> 07:54.414
[phone rings]

07:54.448 --> 07:55.618
(woman on phone)
WENDY'S.

07:55.651 --> 07:58.123
HELLO, WENDY.

07:58.156 --> 07:59.659
THIS IS KEVIN'S FRIEND
MICHAEL.

07:59.691 --> 08:00.961
THIS ISN'T WENDY.

08:00.961 --> 08:03.633
OH, I'M SORRY.
COULD YOU PUT HER ON, PLEASE?

08:03.667 --> 08:06.071
DUDE, THIS IS A WENDY'S
RESTAURANT.

08:07.707 --> 08:09.077
[whispers]
GOD, KEVIN.

08:09.110 --> 08:12.317
OKAY, UM...

08:12.351 --> 08:14.488
COULD I JUST HAVE A FROSTY
AND A BAKED POTATO, PLEASE?

08:14.521 --> 08:16.292
YOU HAVE TO COME TO
THE RESTAURANT TO ORDER FOOD.

08:16.325 --> 08:17.426
WELL, I'LL SEND SOMEBODY
TO PICK IT UP.

08:17.460 --> 08:18.696
JUST HAVE IT READY.

08:18.730 --> 08:20.100
IT'S READY NOW.

08:20.132 --> 08:21.503
WELL, PUT IT ASIDE.

08:21.536 --> 08:22.538
[phone clicks off]

08:23.540 --> 08:24.676
ALL RIGHT, UM...

08:24.708 --> 08:26.211
OKAY, I COLLECTED THE REST
OF THE LADIES.

08:26.245 --> 08:27.615
GOOD, GOOD,

08:27.647 --> 08:29.619
BECAUSE THIS BATCH
WAS AWFUL.

08:29.651 --> 08:31.154
UM...

08:31.189 --> 08:32.290
THIS ONE SAYS "CHAIR MODEL."

08:32.324 --> 08:34.128
I WROTE THAT.

08:34.161 --> 08:35.698
MICHAEL, YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE
TO SETTLE.

08:35.731 --> 08:38.769
THIS IS MY PLEDGE TO YOU.

08:38.804 --> 08:40.307
I WILL FIND HER,

08:40.339 --> 08:42.111
AND I WILL BRING HER
TO YOU.

08:42.144 --> 08:44.181
AND AS GOD IS MY WITNESS,

08:44.215 --> 08:45.818
SHE SHALL BEAR YOUR FRUIT.

08:48.522 --> 08:49.791
THAT SOUNDS GOOD.

08:49.826 --> 08:51.730
GO GET HER.

08:51.763 --> 08:53.133
W--W--WAIT, WAIT.

08:53.166 --> 08:54.500
FIRST GO TO WENDY'S,
GET MY FOOD,

08:54.534 --> 08:55.638
COME BACK, AND THEN GO.

08:58.343 --> 09:00.479
THAT IS FANTASTIC.
THANK YOU.

09:00.512 --> 09:01.081
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

09:01.081 --> 09:03.687
THIS IS JUST WHAT I NEEDED.

09:03.720 --> 09:05.423

IT WAS LIKE TALKING
TO THE SWEET, OLD LADY

13:36.900 --> 13:38.736
ON THE BUS.

13:41.440 --> 13:43.345
THAT'S INCREDIBLY RUDE.

13:43.377 --> 13:45.783
NOW YOU RUINED IT.

13:47.119 --> 13:48.155
WHERE'S SCOTT?

13:48.188 --> 13:49.324
UH, MICHAEL SCOTT

13:49.357 --> 13:50.693
COULD NOT MAKE IT TODAY

13:50.727 --> 13:52.865
DUE TO AN UNFORESEEN
PRIOR ENGAGEMENT.

13:52.897 --> 13:54.033
LET'S JUST MEET BACK

13:54.066 --> 13:57.240
GENTLEMEN, PLEASE.

I HAVE THINGS.

14:07.526 --> 14:10.166
ALL RIGHT,
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

14:10.199 --> 14:11.834
WELL, FIRST OF ALL,
I'D JUST LIKE TO SAY

14:11.869 --> 14:14.507
WHAT AN HONOR IT IS
TO BE SITTING HERE

14:14.540 --> 14:16.410
WITH YOU GENTLEMEN.
YOU HAVE ABOUT TEN SECONDS--

14:16.444 --> 14:19.384
WE WANT
OUR PARKING SPACES BACK.

14:19.416 --> 14:20.852

14:23.392 --> 14:25.161
EVERY MORNING.

14:25.195 --> 14:28.001
AND SOME PEOPLE
HAVE TO PARK REALLY FAR AWAY

14:28.035 --> 14:30.171
AND WALK ALL THE WAY
TO THE OFFICE.

14:30.205 --> 14:33.846
AND SOME PEOPLE
SWEAT TOO MUCH FOR COMFORT.

14:33.880 --> 14:34.848
BY GOD.

14:34.882 --> 14:36.251
I DON'T HAVE TIME
FOR THIS, GUYS.

14:36.284 --> 14:37.888
JUST GIVE THEM BACK
THEIR SPACES.

14:37.922 --> 14:39.858
OKAY.

14:39.892 --> 14:41.394
WE GOOD? OKAY.

14:41.428 --> 14:43.765
COULD'VE DONE THIS
OVER EMAIL.

14:48.944 --> 14:51.281
AFTER STACEY LEFT,
THINGS...

14:51.314 --> 14:53.517
DID NOT GO WELL
FOR AWHILE.

14:53.552 --> 14:56.424
AND IT WAS HARD TO SEE...

14:58.930 --> 15:01.801
IT'S JUST NICE TO WIN ONE.

15:01.801 --> 15:04.573
[door opens, closes]

15:04.606 --> 15:06.378
MARGARET THE LANDLADY?

15:06.410 --> 15:08.082
REALLY, PAM?
IS THAT WHAT YOU THINK OF ME?

15:08.114 --> 15:10.887
SHE'S SWEET AND CUTE.

15:10.920 --> 15:12.089
I THOUGHT
YOU WOULD GET ALONG.

15:12.123 --> 15:13.257
OH, OKAY.

15:13.292 --> 15:15.095
WELL, I'M LOOKING
FOR A PASSIONATE AFFAIR.

15:15.129 --> 15:17.099
NOT COMPANIONSHIP.

15:17.133 --> 15:19.536
I'M A MAN OF INTENSITY.

15:19.570 --> 15:23.913
OF--OF COOL, AND YOUTH,

15:23.947 --> 15:25.582
AND--AND PASSIONATELY.

15:33.197 --> 15:35.201
MARGARET?
I KNOW.

15:35.235 --> 15:37.373
YOU JUST GOT YOURSELF
KICKED OUT OF YOUR APARTMENT.

15:37.406 --> 15:38.909
[laughs]

15:38.944 --> 15:39.979
OH, I DON'T CARE.

15:40.012 --> 15:41.950
I DON'T REALLY LIKE THAT PLACE
THAT MUCH ANYWAY.

15:41.983 --> 15:44.186
I'LL JUST MOVE.
OH, REALLY?

15:44.219 --> 15:45.656
WHO'S GONNA TAKE YOU IN?

15:45.688 --> 15:47.426
YOU'RE MESSY.
YOU'RE A KLUTZ.

15:47.460 --> 15:48.662
YOU SPILL EVERYTHING.

15:48.694 --> 15:51.001
AND YOU LEAVE THE VOLUME
ON THE TV

15:51.034 --> 15:52.670
WAY TOO LOUD.

15:52.702 --> 15:55.576
YEAH. MAYBE I'LL JUST
MOVE IN WITH MY BOYFRIEND

15:55.609 --> 15:57.613
'CAUSE HE'S KIND
OF A SLOB TOO.

15:57.645 --> 16:01.021
OKAY. SURE.
LET'S DO IT.

16:01.054 --> 16:01.921
[laughs]

16:01.921 --> 16:05.998
NO, I, UM, WELL,
I'M NOT GONNA--I'M--

16:06.030 --> 16:08.667
I'M NOT GONNA MOVE IN
WITH ANYONE UNLESS I'M ENGAGED.

16:09.704 --> 16:12.042
HAVE I NOT PROPOSED
TO YOU YET?

16:12.075 --> 16:14.379
MM, I DON'T...NO.

16:14.414 --> 16:16.518
OH.
NO. MM-MM.

16:16.550 --> 16:18.990
WELL, THAT'S COMIN'.

16:19.024 --> 16:20.126
OH, RIGHT NOW?

16:20.158 --> 16:22.330
NO. I'M NOT GONNA DO IT
RIGHT HERE.

16:22.362 --> 16:24.267
THAT WOULD BE RATHER LAME.

16:24.299 --> 16:26.538
OKAY.
SO THEN WHEN?

16:26.571 --> 16:27.573
PAM, I'M NOT
GONNA TELL YOU.

16:27.605 --> 16:28.642
I HATE TO BREAK IT TO YOU,

16:28.674 --> 16:29.710
BUT THAT'S NOT HOW
THAT WORKS.

16:29.743 --> 16:32.050
OH, RIGHT. YEAH.

16:32.083 --> 16:33.485
WAIT, I'M SERIOUS.

16:33.518 --> 16:34.719
IT'S HAPPENING.
OKAY.

16:34.754 --> 16:36.558
AND WHEN IT HAPPENS,

16:36.591 --> 16:39.229
IT'S GOING TO KICK YOUR ASS,
BEESLY.

16:39.264 --> 16:40.731
SO...

16:40.766 --> 16:42.670
STAY SHARP.

16:42.703 --> 16:44.339
I'VE BEEN WARNED.

16:47.713 --> 16:50.519
I AM NOT KIDDING.

16:55.828 --> 16:59.070
GOT IT A WEEK
AFTER WE STARTED DATING.

16:59.104 --> 17:01.574
I DON'T KNOW, MAN.

17:01.608 --> 17:04.780
I WAS WITH JAN
FOR SO LONG.

17:04.813 --> 17:08.487
I WAS EXCITED
ABOUT MEETING SOMEBODY NEW.

17:08.521 --> 17:10.191
PUT MY HEART OUT THERE.

17:14.467 --> 17:16.070
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU NEED?

17:17.306 --> 17:19.343
CLOSURE.

17:19.377 --> 17:22.549
YOU'RE RIGHT.

17:22.583 --> 17:24.820
WHAT DO YOU MEAN THOUGH?

17:24.853 --> 17:26.191
THERE WAS A WOMAN
IN YOUR LIFE

17:26.223 --> 17:28.262
WHO AFFECTED YOU
VERY DEEPLY,

17:28.294 --> 17:31.367
AND SHE LEFT
BEFORE YOU COULD SAY GOOD-BYE.

17:31.401 --> 17:35.376
I THINK YOU NEED
TO SAY GOOD-BYE.

17:35.408 --> 17:36.744
HMM.

17:36.778 --> 17:40.152
COME ON.
I'LL DRIVE.

17:40.186 --> 17:41.721
WE DID IT!
I DID IT.

17:41.754 --> 17:43.892
WE GOT OUR SPACES BACK.

17:43.924 --> 17:45.829
[laughter and cheers]

17:45.861 --> 17:47.766
NICE JOB.

17:47.800 --> 17:49.904
NICE.
YEAH, THERE IT IS.

17:49.936 --> 17:51.641
YOU'RE WELCOME.
[laughs]

17:51.674 --> 17:54.347
DID I DO THIS FOR ME? NO.

17:54.379 --> 17:56.851
I DID THIS
FOR THE LITTLE GUY.

17:56.883 --> 17:58.887
FOR JOE SIX-PACK.

17:58.922 --> 17:59.956
THE GUY WHO WAKES UP
EVERY MORNING

17:59.989 --> 18:01.828
IN HIS $400
A MONTH APARTMENT,

18:01.861 --> 18:05.236
WONDERS HOW HE'S GONNA PAY
HIS MORTGAGE THAT MONTH.

18:05.269 --> 18:08.375
WONDERS HOW HE'S GONNA FILL
HIS CAR UP WITH OIL.

18:08.407 --> 18:11.947
WONDERS HOW AM I GOING TO PAY
MY KIDS' ORPHANAGE BILLS?

18:11.981 --> 18:14.754
THAT GUY...

18:14.786 --> 18:17.892
SHOULDN'T HAVE TO WONDER
WHERE HE'S GONNA PARK.

18:34.860 --> 18:36.597
HOW DID SHE DIE?

18:38.435 --> 18:40.439
I GUESS YOU COULD SAY
SHE DIED

18:40.471 --> 18:44.747
OF BLUNT FORCE TRAUMA
AND BLOOD LOSS.

18:44.780 --> 18:45.816
SHE GOT IN A CAR ACCIDENT

18:45.849 --> 18:47.820
AND PLOUGHED INTO THE SIDE
OF AN AIRPLANE HANGAR.

18:47.853 --> 18:49.656
GOD.
YEAH.

18:49.689 --> 18:51.528
SHE WAS SO INNOCENT.

18:51.560 --> 18:55.402
SHE WAS STONED,
APPARENTLY.

18:55.436 --> 18:56.538
YOU KNOW,
I USED TO THINK

18:56.570 --> 19:00.611
THAT I HAD THIS PERFECT PERSON
OUT THERE WAITING FOR ME.

19:00.645 --> 19:03.617
BUT NOW I KNOW THAT THAT'S
JUST SILLY.

19:03.652 --> 19:05.721
BECAUSE SHE'S DEAD.

19:05.756 --> 19:09.529
WHAT DO YOU DO?

19:09.564 --> 19:12.370
YOU WAIT TILL NEXT YEAR'S
CHAIR CATALOGUE COMES OUT

19:12.402 --> 19:14.939
