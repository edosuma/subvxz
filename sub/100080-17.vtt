WEBVTT

00:07.181 --> 00:08.356
Previously onSWAT...

00:08.399 --> 00:09.705
Uh, Lieutenant,
this is my brother Terry.

00:09.748 --> 00:12.882
Hey, nice
to meet you.Hi.

00:12.925 --> 00:15.667
It's been a long time.Sorry about what I said to you.

00:15.711 --> 00:17.669
Well, you save
people's lives.

00:17.713 --> 00:20.411
I film crime scenes and then
sell 'em to the tabloids.

00:20.455 --> 00:22.848
It's no secret who's got
the more honorable gig.

00:22.892 --> 00:24.676
Thanks for always
having my six.

00:24.720 --> 00:26.156
Yeah. [laughs softly]

00:32.728 --> 00:34.295
[clears throat]

00:34.338 --> 00:36.688
I-I think I... I think
I drank too much whiskey.

00:36.732 --> 00:38.864
Sorry. Chris, I'm sorry.No, no, no. That was my fault.

00:38.908 --> 00:40.823
You and me-- we're teammates.

00:40.866 --> 00:42.694
I'm always gonna haveyour back on the job,

00:42.738 --> 00:44.261
but that's whereit ends from now on.

00:44.305 --> 00:45.828
You're, like,twice as strong as last week.

00:45.871 --> 00:48.222
And half as strong as I was
before getting injured.

00:48.265 --> 00:50.267
I need to be 100% if
I'm gonna pass my PFQ

00:50.311 --> 00:51.790
and get back out in the field.

00:51.834 --> 00:54.271
You're still gonna tryto pass the PFQ?I'm gonna do it.

00:54.315 --> 00:56.273
I just need to be
with my team.

00:56.317 --> 00:57.448
Well, look at that--Buck Spivey.

00:57.492 --> 00:58.710
You look like you're
doing really good.

00:58.754 --> 01:00.451
I'm hooked up with a guynamed Owen Bennett.

01:00.495 --> 01:01.713
And, uh, we're looking

01:01.757 --> 01:03.237
to launch a privatesecurity firm.

01:03.280 --> 01:04.455
But what would really put things

01:04.499 --> 01:05.891
over the top would beto have you on board.

01:05.935 --> 01:07.415
I've struggled a bit
since leaving SWAT.

01:07.458 --> 01:09.547
You owe me.Is that what this is
about-- me owing you?

01:09.591 --> 01:12.159
Because, Buck, it seems
to me that goes both ways.

01:15.684 --> 01:17.773
You realize we're overqualifiedfor this gig, yeah?

01:17.816 --> 01:19.818
Yeah, well, I knowthat every job is important

01:19.862 --> 01:21.385
for a new company like ours.

01:21.429 --> 01:22.995
Lot of competition
in private security.

01:23.039 --> 01:24.823
Promoter likeshow we handle ourselves,

01:24.867 --> 01:26.347
maybe we snaga long-term contract.

01:26.390 --> 01:28.349
So let's justkeep the clients safe.

01:28.392 --> 01:30.307
Right, from rabid
teenyboppers

01:30.351 --> 01:32.353
wasting their parents' moneyon concert tix.

01:32.396 --> 01:33.789
Come on, Deac.

01:33.832 --> 01:35.660
Is "teenyboppers"
even still a word?

01:35.704 --> 01:37.358
Oh, now you're justage-shaming me

01:37.401 --> 01:40.491
with your yogurt parfaitand 30-inch waist.

01:40.535 --> 01:41.971
You enjoy that.

01:42.014 --> 01:43.538
You're crabby today.

01:43.581 --> 01:46.236
Mm. Maybe you're oversensitive?

01:46.280 --> 01:47.542
So, what do you want to do--

01:47.585 --> 01:48.847
go shock-and-awewith a six-man team?

01:48.891 --> 01:50.327
Two-two-and-two on the door?Realistically,

01:50.371 --> 01:51.676
I think we just need
a three-man team

01:51.720 --> 01:53.287
shadowing the client
in and out of the event.

01:53.330 --> 01:55.245
Right. Aka the vanity crew.

01:55.289 --> 01:57.378
You know, our star--he looks tough, plays safe.

01:57.421 --> 01:58.814
He's a wussy. [chuckles]

01:58.857 --> 02:01.947
Wussy from get-upto get-down. Ah.

02:01.991 --> 02:04.036
You doing okay?

02:04.080 --> 02:06.256
Oh, top of the world, Deac.

02:06.300 --> 02:08.389
[laughs]It's just, it ain't SWAT.

02:08.432 --> 02:10.347
Pays better by the hour.

02:10.391 --> 02:11.783
That's what I tell the mirrorevery morning.

02:11.827 --> 02:13.785
[phone beeping]
Oh.

02:13.829 --> 02:15.787
Okay, you're on the clock now,so you and I are done.

02:15.831 --> 02:17.789
You got a big day?Yeah.

02:17.833 --> 02:19.269
Buck.Hey.

02:19.313 --> 02:21.315
Hey, man.He's all yours.

02:22.533 --> 02:24.274
What's going on?

02:24.318 --> 02:25.797
We're muscle
for a joint task force

02:25.841 --> 02:27.364
with the Gang Division.

02:27.408 --> 02:28.974
Yeah? How many...how many targets?

02:29.018 --> 02:31.499
Four different gang leaders,
plus any crew they bring along.

02:31.542 --> 02:34.284
All in one location?Gets them max charges
on conspiracy.

02:34.328 --> 02:36.068
Break the gangs
from the top down.

02:36.112 --> 02:38.419
Well, that seems likea high-risk move.Nah.

02:38.462 --> 02:39.768
That's why we're
gonna let 'em scatter

02:39.811 --> 02:41.248
before we start
picking 'em off.

02:41.291 --> 02:42.858
We'll be in control
of time, place

02:42.901 --> 02:44.381
and the number of players.

02:44.425 --> 02:46.253
All the variables.Well, stay liquid.

02:46.296 --> 02:47.558
Drown the suckers.[laughs]

02:47.602 --> 02:49.604
Really glad to see you, man.

02:51.606 --> 02:53.825
All right, so, Buck,
you'll handle the...

02:53.869 --> 02:55.566
Oh, yeah.Don't you worry, Deac.

02:55.610 --> 02:58.743
I got the, uh...
I got the side job covered.

03:03.008 --> 03:04.836
Dude, you're not missing
anything.

03:04.880 --> 03:06.577
All-day stakeout
beats maybe--

03:06.621 --> 03:08.710
I don't know-- dental work?

03:08.753 --> 03:10.451
Until you roll up
on the targets.

03:10.494 --> 03:12.931
All right, that's-that'sthe bonus. I won't lie.

03:12.975 --> 03:14.629
Yeah, while I'm watching
spy monitors.

03:14.672 --> 03:15.978
Hey.

03:16.021 --> 03:17.762
You're back in the field again.

03:17.806 --> 03:18.937
Well, watching the field
and being

03:18.981 --> 03:20.330
in the field
ain't the same thing,

03:20.374 --> 03:21.592
so don't pat me
on the back

03:21.636 --> 03:23.594
like I'm some kind
of needy girl.

03:23.638 --> 03:26.380
Should I, uh, walk outand come in again?

03:26.423 --> 03:27.816
Sorry. I'm sorry.No.

03:27.859 --> 03:29.121
I get it. I get it.

03:29.165 --> 03:31.472
I-I've had my share
of needy girls.

03:31.515 --> 03:33.952
They just don't look like you.Yeah.

03:33.996 --> 03:35.345
Hey.Yeah.

03:35.389 --> 03:36.607
I miss you out there.

03:36.651 --> 03:39.958
Well, I'm almost on deck, man.

03:40.002 --> 03:42.439
Just need to pass the PFQ.

03:42.483 --> 03:44.615
Just like all the other times.

03:44.659 --> 03:46.400
Yeah?

03:49.881 --> 03:52.449
Well, I got your backs out theretoday, so don't-don't...

03:52.493 --> 03:54.408
don't make it hardon me now, all right?

03:54.451 --> 03:55.670
All right.

03:55.713 --> 03:57.672
What the hell was that about?

03:57.715 --> 03:59.804
He's just scared.If he can't pass...

03:59.848 --> 04:01.893
I mean, SWAT is in his DNA.

04:01.937 --> 04:04.853
Unless it isn't anymore.
And then what?

04:04.896 --> 04:07.551
Third-generation SWAT
just washes out?

04:07.595 --> 04:10.337
Last generation of Lucas
to wear the patch?

04:12.077 --> 04:13.775
[clears throat]

04:13.818 --> 04:17.735
Even if Luca had to go
desk, he's still SWAT.

04:17.779 --> 04:19.781
Is that how you'd feel?

04:20.825 --> 04:22.349
No.

04:22.392 --> 04:23.915
Me, neither.

04:23.959 --> 04:26.004
So, how's everything
with Molly?

04:26.048 --> 04:29.573
Good. I, uh...I never thanked you.

04:29.617 --> 04:31.749
Molly told me thatyou were encouraging

04:31.793 --> 04:33.490
when she asked you about me.

04:33.534 --> 04:35.492
She wasn't supposed
to tell you that.

04:35.536 --> 04:39.366
I-I got to say,I was a little surprised,

04:39.409 --> 04:42.934
given the circumstances...No. Don't. Don't.

04:42.978 --> 04:45.807
You and me--
we-we... we had a moment.

04:45.850 --> 04:48.636
A mini, drunken moment.

04:48.679 --> 04:50.681
And a bad idea.

04:50.725 --> 04:54.555
And so, fixing me up was,what, you making amends?

04:56.208 --> 04:58.167
Just trying to help two people

04:58.210 --> 04:59.995
get happy, you know?

05:01.692 --> 05:04.521
What about you?How you doing?

05:04.565 --> 05:07.045
Feels good to be home
with my aunt and uncle.

05:07.089 --> 05:10.527
Remembering
how to laugh.

05:10.571 --> 05:12.529
Anyone new in your life?Don't ask me that.

05:12.573 --> 05:14.531
What? Friends can ask.

05:14.575 --> 05:16.011
[phone beeping]

05:16.054 --> 05:18.013
The buzzer. Time to roll.

05:20.189 --> 05:22.800
â™ª

05:31.766 --> 05:33.637
You can't improve
on nature, babe.

05:34.769 --> 05:37.075
Love you, T.J.,
some of the time.

05:37.119 --> 05:38.729
Most of the time.Yeah.

05:38.773 --> 05:40.470
You're already
kind of late, T.

05:41.602 --> 05:43.038
They'll wait for me.

05:51.089 --> 05:53.091
Welcome to Hotel L.A.[chuckling]

05:54.615 --> 05:56.181
20-David to D-Team.

05:56.225 --> 05:58.053
The last player at the
summit just drove up--

05:58.096 --> 06:00.142
T.J. Doyle repping
the Coffin Makers.

06:00.185 --> 06:02.144
Hold in place.CHRIS:
24-David holding.

06:02.187 --> 06:04.189
All right. Hurry up and wait.

06:04.233 --> 06:06.191
What did Buck always say

06:06.235 --> 06:08.585
was the most important thingin a stakeout?

06:08.629 --> 06:10.282
Snacks?[laughs]

06:10.326 --> 06:11.893
Spoken like a dad.

06:11.936 --> 06:14.286
No, man. Patience.

06:14.330 --> 06:15.810
Builds anticipation.

06:15.853 --> 06:16.985
I already can't wait.

06:18.247 --> 06:20.292
Man, Coffin Makers, Soldados,

06:20.336 --> 06:21.946
Brotherhood, One-Niners--

06:21.990 --> 06:23.992
these crews hate each other
with a capital "H."

06:24.035 --> 06:25.689
They get busy together,they could make L.A.

06:25.733 --> 06:26.995
the crime capitalof America.

06:27.038 --> 06:28.866
Except their next stop
is the holding tank.

06:28.910 --> 06:29.998
All right, we're ready.

06:30.041 --> 06:31.521
Hondo and Deacon
own the entrance,

06:31.565 --> 06:33.828
we got the only other lineof travel off the block.

06:33.871 --> 06:35.569
These bosses are doneand don't know it.

06:35.612 --> 06:37.135
Bets on how long
we have to wait?

06:37.179 --> 06:38.615
I'm going with two hours.

06:38.659 --> 06:39.921
They'll agree or they won't.

06:39.964 --> 06:41.226
Either way, we own them.

06:41.270 --> 06:43.577
[piano plays slow,
gentle jazz music]

06:45.361 --> 06:47.494
Don't swallow her now.

06:49.017 --> 06:50.845
You take care of my girl.

06:59.941 --> 07:01.856
BARTENDER:
What can I get you?

07:03.161 --> 07:04.902
[gasps, chuckles]

07:04.946 --> 07:06.556
Mmm.Mmm.

07:06.600 --> 07:08.819
Te amo, cariÃ±o. Yo tambiÃ©n.

07:19.874 --> 07:23.225
Now that we're all assembled,
thank you all for coming.

07:23.268 --> 07:25.880
Shows that we can
put business first.

07:25.923 --> 07:28.012
Our organizations move
different products,

07:28.056 --> 07:29.840
but we all have the same goal--

07:29.884 --> 07:31.146
profit.

07:31.189 --> 07:33.844
We also have
the same problem-- pipeline.

07:33.888 --> 07:35.759
We all need a
safer, better,

07:35.803 --> 07:37.587
faster shipment
across the border.

07:38.806 --> 07:42.157
A new route that we create,
we control.

07:42.200 --> 07:43.985
I'm talking
a business cooperative

07:44.028 --> 07:46.857
to securely transport
any and all commodities.

07:46.901 --> 07:49.860
Ah, that's it.
Keep it coming, fool.

07:49.904 --> 07:51.862
On the record-- conspiracy,

07:51.906 --> 07:54.299
street terrorism,
full enhancements.

07:54.343 --> 07:56.998
Run by you
and your One-Niners, Cyrus?

07:57.041 --> 07:59.043
Manuela Diaz likes
to speak first and speak loud.

07:59.087 --> 08:00.871
Not a shy girl.

08:00.915 --> 08:02.220
Yeah, murdered her way
straight to the top.

08:02.264 --> 08:03.874
I read her file.Took two sittings.

08:03.918 --> 08:06.877
Did it mention how she raised
the bar for Los Soldados?

08:06.921 --> 08:08.575
I know she took the gang
statewide.

08:08.618 --> 08:11.055
Got her the respectof every cartel boss in Mexico.

08:11.099 --> 08:13.101
Even El Diablo.
That says a lot.

08:13.144 --> 08:14.319
CYRUS:
I'm offering shares.

08:14.363 --> 08:16.017
Thug with a prospectus.
We've been trying

08:16.060 --> 08:19.020
to bring in Cyrus since beforehe was the number-one One-Niner.

08:19.063 --> 08:20.978
MAN:
To build some tunnel
that never gets finished?

08:21.022 --> 08:22.371
Like, now you're an engineer,
Cyrus?

08:22.414 --> 08:25.113
Sammy B. still overdresses.

08:25.156 --> 08:26.723
Sharpest mug shots on file.

08:26.767 --> 08:29.073
Him and The Brotherhoodlove to strut.

08:29.117 --> 08:32.250
Tunnel's already built, Sammy.
We just have to open it up.

08:32.294 --> 08:33.817
What did he just say?

08:33.861 --> 08:35.079
Oh, this is gonna play great
in court.

08:35.123 --> 08:36.646
You're talking
about the Rabiosos' tunnel.

08:36.690 --> 08:37.995
Never reached the border.

08:38.953 --> 08:40.084
I've walked it.

08:41.216 --> 08:42.957
Don't call me a liar now.

08:43.000 --> 08:44.741
How about a wishful thinker?

08:48.832 --> 08:51.226
Brave move for a guy
without backup in the room.

08:51.269 --> 08:53.707
Pretty doesn't make him smart.You think T.J.'s pretty?

08:53.750 --> 08:55.404
That's more than
I need to know.

08:55.447 --> 08:58.755
Coffin Makers always been anarrogant bunch. White privilege.

08:58.799 --> 09:01.279
So, what's he bringingto the table?
Besides diversity?

09:01.323 --> 09:04.065
Southwest drug trade.
Bootleg oxy, hydro, fentanyl.

09:04.108 --> 09:07.111
Busy folks in that room. You
want it, they sell it-- drugs,

09:07.155 --> 09:08.678
guns, girls, boys.

09:08.722 --> 09:10.114
Yeah, until they
drive away today.

09:10.158 --> 09:12.639
Once they lose sight of
each other, D-Team moves in,

09:12.682 --> 09:13.944
grabs 'em all up
at the same time.

09:13.988 --> 09:15.816
Divide and conquer?Safer than a firefight.

09:15.859 --> 09:17.426
Amen to that, man.

09:23.084 --> 09:24.476
I won't be long.
Keep it close.

09:24.520 --> 09:26.087
Will do.

09:30.744 --> 09:32.006
[laughs]

09:34.530 --> 09:37.751
Mm. Mm. [laughs]

09:39.100 --> 09:40.667
Dad.

09:41.972 --> 09:43.800
Don't get up, dirtbag.

09:43.844 --> 09:46.716
Hey.I am not going backto Salt Lake, like, ever!

09:46.760 --> 09:48.152
You're coming with me,

09:48.196 --> 09:50.372
even if I have to carry you
out of here, Mary-Beth.

09:50.415 --> 09:52.156
Mary-Beth?I don't use that name anymore.

09:52.200 --> 09:54.289
My name's Krystal now.

09:54.332 --> 09:56.813
We'll talk about that in
the car. Come on. Come on.You can't just kidnap me.

09:56.857 --> 09:58.423
I...Back off!

09:59.990 --> 10:01.426
I'm a reserve deputy sheriff.

10:01.470 --> 10:03.211
Put the gun down.

10:03.254 --> 10:04.995
Hotel L.A. Rendezvous Bar.
There's a man with a gun.

10:05.039 --> 10:06.083
[grunting, gunshot]

10:06.127 --> 10:07.084
Daddy!

10:07.128 --> 10:08.999
[gasps]Wh-What did you do?

10:09.043 --> 10:11.001
The gun went off because of him!I didn't shoot him.

10:11.045 --> 10:13.090
Drop your guns!No!

10:13.134 --> 10:14.701
Lenny!Mary-Beth!

10:14.744 --> 10:16.267
Let me go!

10:18.922 --> 10:21.098
[groans] My God.

10:21.142 --> 10:24.014
You with me?[frantic chatter]

10:24.058 --> 10:25.450
WOMAN [over radio]:
Shots fired, L.A. Hotel.

10:25.494 --> 10:26.843
What just happened?

10:26.887 --> 10:28.018
Multiple 911 calls
still coming in

10:28.062 --> 10:29.324
from the hotel, Commander.

10:29.367 --> 10:30.891
With nobody undercover inside.

10:30.934 --> 10:33.415
We had to keep the entirestaff blind to the op.

10:33.458 --> 10:36.113
You know we couldn't risk
a leak. You agreed.

10:36.157 --> 10:37.201
It was a simple,
perfect plan.

10:37.245 --> 10:38.899
Best-laid plans of mice and men.

10:38.942 --> 10:40.291
R-Commander to all
responding units.

10:40.335 --> 10:42.119
We have a Code 5 in progress.

10:42.163 --> 10:43.773
Officer on site.

10:43.817 --> 10:45.340
Do not respond
with lights and sirens.

10:45.383 --> 10:46.863
LUCA:
Nothing to see down there
even if

10:46.907 --> 10:48.473
the targets happento look out the windows, man.

10:48.517 --> 10:50.867
They're way up on the tenthfloor-- look at them.

10:50.911 --> 10:52.477
They don't have a clue.

10:52.521 --> 10:54.044
It's unrelated.

10:54.088 --> 10:55.480
You don't have
to compromise your op.

10:57.613 --> 10:59.049
R-Commander
to all responding units,

10:59.093 --> 11:00.224
stop vehicle and foot traffic

11:00.268 --> 11:01.530
in the vicinity.Go!

11:01.573 --> 11:03.488
Wait for further orders
from the unit on site.

11:03.532 --> 11:05.316
Command to 20-David,
you're clear for entry.

11:05.360 --> 11:06.796
One gunshot victim,

11:06.840 --> 11:08.929
one hostage,
possible domestic dispute.

11:08.972 --> 11:11.409
Try to clean this up quick and
quiet so we don't blow the op.

11:11.453 --> 11:13.585
20-David to D-Team,
30 seconds out!

11:13.629 --> 11:16.066
[tires screech]

11:16.110 --> 11:18.112
â™ª

11:56.585 --> 11:59.022
HONDO:
We got a man
with a gunshot wound.

12:00.415 --> 12:01.503
I'm okay, sir.

12:01.546 --> 12:02.547
Please, keep going.

12:02.591 --> 12:04.114
Find my daughter.

12:04.158 --> 12:06.377
Jackson, get this officer
out to an R/A.

12:06.421 --> 12:09.032
There's one on the way.Hey, her name is Mary-Beth.

12:09.076 --> 12:10.947
All right, I got you.

12:10.991 --> 12:13.036
Where was the last place
you saw the hostage?

12:13.080 --> 12:14.342
The biker dude pulled her out

12:14.385 --> 12:15.909
through the restaurant,which isn't open yet.

12:15.952 --> 12:17.127
Deacon, you and Chris.

12:17.171 --> 12:18.520
We'll track them.

12:18.563 --> 12:20.304
Describe this "biker dude."

12:20.348 --> 12:21.871
Big, black leather jacket.

12:21.915 --> 12:23.003
This the guy you saw?

12:23.046 --> 12:24.004
Not at all.

12:24.047 --> 12:25.092
She called him Lenny.

12:25.135 --> 12:26.658
Seemed likesome kind of

12:26.702 --> 12:28.399
protection thing, you know?
She was drinking; he wasn't.

12:28.443 --> 12:30.619
Babysitting T.J.'s girl
while he's upstairs?

12:30.662 --> 12:32.273
How far can Lenny
get with her?

12:32.316 --> 12:34.144
From the restaurant,
anywhere on the main floor.

12:34.188 --> 12:35.319
TAN: Hotel securityshut down the elevator

12:35.363 --> 12:36.973
as soon as the first
911 call went out.

12:37.017 --> 12:38.105
That's protocol, yeah.

12:38.148 --> 12:39.454
DEACON:All clear.

12:39.497 --> 12:41.586
Couple of chairs
knocked over near the door.

12:41.630 --> 12:43.414
Two sets of stairs
going to other floors.

12:43.458 --> 12:46.287
Uh, those are just publicstaircases for this wing.

12:46.330 --> 12:47.505
This hotel's,like, 100 years old.

12:47.549 --> 12:48.637
There's stairs everywhere.

12:48.680 --> 12:49.899
Now, you get someplace safe.

12:49.943 --> 12:51.509
All right, we sweep by grid.

12:51.553 --> 12:54.034
And fast, before word
gets out that we're here.

12:54.077 --> 12:55.949
Let's move.

12:55.992 --> 12:58.516
[phone buzzing]

13:00.692 --> 13:02.129
Hello.LENNY: T.J.,

13:02.172 --> 13:04.218
we're hiding by the pool.
Somebody called the cops.

13:04.261 --> 13:05.567
Keep your ass parked

13:05.610 --> 13:07.003
right where you are.

13:07.047 --> 13:09.005
He's out of
range for audio.Here he comes.

13:09.049 --> 13:11.051
We have ears again.
T.J.: Sorry, Cyrus.

13:11.094 --> 13:13.444
Family emergency.I got to dash.

13:13.488 --> 13:16.012
There won't be a second
invitation for you, T.J.

13:16.056 --> 13:18.362
Unless we need each other.

13:20.495 --> 13:22.062
LYNCH:
T.J.'s not gonna tell 'em.

13:22.105 --> 13:23.454
Smarter than he looks.

13:23.498 --> 13:25.282
All right, we follow
him, we find the girl,

13:25.326 --> 13:26.936
take him down,
him and the buddy.

13:26.980 --> 13:28.503
Solve all three problems
at the same time.

13:28.546 --> 13:30.113
[phone chimes]

13:31.462 --> 13:32.942
VÃ¡monos.

13:32.986 --> 13:35.379
SAMMY B.:
SWAT's here. What the hell?

13:35.423 --> 13:36.946
They had spotters
on the street, man.

13:36.990 --> 13:38.165
HICKS:
We got two separate crews

13:38.208 --> 13:40.080
of fleeing felons,plus a hostage situation.

13:40.123 --> 13:41.646
How many civilians
at risk in the hotel?

13:41.690 --> 13:44.388
Too many. How comeCyrus isn't worried?

13:44.432 --> 13:45.563
HICKS: Who cares?Long as he stays put,

13:45.607 --> 13:46.651
one less target to handle.

13:46.695 --> 13:48.653
Luca, make sure
this girl's father

13:48.697 --> 13:50.220
doesn't try to sneak
back on the premises.

13:50.264 --> 13:51.482
We've already had
enough trouble with him.

13:51.526 --> 13:52.744
Roger that, man.
He's a cop.

13:52.788 --> 13:54.355
He's a victim.We had no problems

13:54.398 --> 13:56.226
until this guy showed up,two states away

13:56.270 --> 13:57.967
from his own jurisdiction,playing cowboy,

13:58.011 --> 14:00.578
so I'm not having a whole lotof sympathy for him right now.

14:00.622 --> 14:02.624
Command to 20-David,
I'm heading over to security.

14:02.667 --> 14:04.104
Set up a command post.

14:04.147 --> 14:06.062
Making friendswherever you go?

14:06.106 --> 14:08.064
It's my specialty, Frank.

14:08.108 --> 14:09.500
We'll keep surveilling.

14:09.544 --> 14:11.285
Be like old times.

14:12.373 --> 14:14.549
Ah, they're turned off already.

14:14.592 --> 14:16.420
Where are the stairs?

14:16.464 --> 14:18.205
Is this the
north side?

14:18.248 --> 14:20.250
Never mind.

14:20.294 --> 14:22.252
Could you try to
look like guests?

14:22.296 --> 14:24.080
Who don't
have warrants

14:24.124 --> 14:26.430
out for 'em?

14:39.139 --> 14:41.097
Krystal!Where you at?

14:41.141 --> 14:44.057
I'm here.
Lenny, come on out!

14:44.100 --> 14:47.060
Behind you!HONDO: Stop right there!Show me your hands!

14:47.103 --> 14:49.671
Tan![gunshot, T.J. groans]

14:49.714 --> 14:51.499
Let the girl go!I'm not stopping her.

14:51.542 --> 14:53.544
Put the gun down. Put it down!

14:53.588 --> 14:55.459
[T.J. groaning]

14:55.503 --> 14:57.766
Face the glass.
Hands in the air.[T.J. coughs]

14:57.809 --> 14:59.681
Give me your hands.Street.

15:01.422 --> 15:02.771
HONDO: Mary-Beth?Give me your hands!

15:02.814 --> 15:05.078
Come on. It's okay.
You're safe.

15:05.121 --> 15:06.557
It's all right.
You can come out.

15:06.601 --> 15:09.212
Come on out.Come to me. You're safe.

15:09.256 --> 15:12.085
It's all right.I got you, Mary-Beth.

15:12.128 --> 15:13.608
She hates that name.

15:15.349 --> 15:16.393
Let's go.

15:20.702 --> 15:23.139
Reserve Deputy
George Becket, sir.

15:23.183 --> 15:24.619
Salt Lake City
Sheriff's Office.

15:24.662 --> 15:26.534
Gonna need your gun, George.
Yeah, I didn't discharge it.

15:26.577 --> 15:28.101
This is from his bullet.

15:28.144 --> 15:29.711
You know we stillgot to test.

15:32.757 --> 15:34.498
You're a long wayfrom home, George.

15:34.542 --> 15:37.023
[sighs] I've been
looking for my daughter

15:37.066 --> 15:39.329
ever since she
took off last year.

15:39.373 --> 15:41.505
Then she called her mom on
her birthday about a week ago.

15:41.549 --> 15:43.333
And you traced her phone.

15:43.377 --> 15:45.248
It's all legal.

15:45.292 --> 15:47.163
The rest was easy.

15:47.207 --> 15:49.339
She was engaged before.

15:49.383 --> 15:51.298
Nice guy.

15:51.341 --> 15:53.822
Why do some girls always
have to look for trouble?

15:53.865 --> 15:55.476
Yeah, won't kill me.

15:55.519 --> 15:57.521
Count your blessings, right?Yeah.

15:59.480 --> 16:00.742
You got kids, Officer?

16:00.785 --> 16:02.396
Uh, not yet.

16:02.439 --> 16:06.269
Yeah. Little advice
from the frontline?

16:06.313 --> 16:08.532
Save yourself the grief.

16:08.576 --> 16:11.057
I promised her mother
I'd bring her home.

16:11.100 --> 16:13.189
She's only 22.

16:13.233 --> 16:14.799
Well, she's an adult, man.

16:15.844 --> 16:18.542
Doesn't make her a grown-up.

16:18.586 --> 16:20.675
Is my dad okay?It was an accident.

16:20.718 --> 16:22.372
Get him out of here!Get him out of here!

16:22.416 --> 16:25.375
Can I see him?If he hasn't been transported.

16:25.419 --> 16:26.637
Get her to the R/A

16:26.681 --> 16:28.509
so they can check her out.You got it.

16:28.552 --> 16:30.337
Let's go, ma'am.

16:31.555 --> 16:33.383
I'm sorry.Don't tell me.

16:33.427 --> 16:35.124
Tell your pop.

16:37.170 --> 16:39.433
This is 20-David to 22-David.

16:39.476 --> 16:42.653
Coffin Makers in custody,
One-Niners staying put.

16:42.697 --> 16:45.134
Los Soldados and The Brotherhoodare on the move.

16:45.178 --> 16:47.571
Now, there may be civilians
between them and the exit.

16:47.615 --> 16:49.399
Inform the ranking officer.

16:49.443 --> 16:50.792
LUCA:22-David. On it.

16:50.835 --> 16:52.837
Thanks.Daddy.

16:56.450 --> 16:58.669
Terry, what are you
doing here, man?Covering the news.

16:58.713 --> 17:00.149
What does it looklike I'm doing?

17:00.193 --> 17:01.803
Just trying to get some footageto sell to the station.

17:01.846 --> 17:03.544
You got an update for me?Look, even if

17:03.587 --> 17:05.415
you were a real reporter
with a real press pass,

17:05.459 --> 17:06.808
not just some
freelance stringer,

17:06.851 --> 17:09.158
you don't cross
police lines, man.

17:09.202 --> 17:11.813
It's a public safety rule.Yeah, why aren't youwith your team?

17:11.856 --> 17:14.163
Stop.

17:14.207 --> 17:16.774
Look, I'm still rehabbing
from the hip surgery, man.

17:16.818 --> 17:18.472
It's taking a minute.

17:18.515 --> 17:20.474
I don't have time to talk
about this, all right?

17:20.517 --> 17:22.258
Give me a comment on camera,I'm out of your hair.

17:22.302 --> 17:24.130
So you're blackmailing
your own brother now?

17:24.173 --> 17:25.653
Dude, how did you even
sneak through here?

17:25.696 --> 17:28.134
Dude, I heard it on the scannerbefore the tape went up.

17:28.177 --> 17:29.831
I got to get here beforeeverybody else does,

17:29.874 --> 17:31.615
or I get nothing.You know how it goes.No, no, no, don't try

17:31.659 --> 17:32.964
to work me, man.
You need to get back

17:33.008 --> 17:34.401
behind the tape
right now. Go.

17:34.444 --> 17:35.706
Oh, yeah? [laughs]

17:35.750 --> 17:37.621
Is this the partwhere you count to three,

17:37.665 --> 17:39.145
like when we were kids?

17:39.188 --> 17:41.364
Are you gonna kickmy little ass?

17:41.408 --> 17:42.844
One.

17:44.193 --> 17:46.848
Two!Yeah, don't hurt your hip.

17:51.635 --> 17:53.594
ANA:

17:53.637 --> 17:55.813
No puedo escucharte. Â¿Que pasÃ³?

17:55.857 --> 17:57.815
No te muevas, seÃ±ora.

17:57.859 --> 18:00.601
Okay, okay.

18:00.644 --> 18:03.343
You're gonna get us
out of here, Ana.

18:10.872 --> 18:13.309
Hondo, this is Greg Russo,
assistant manager.

18:13.353 --> 18:15.181
He just got word
a housekeeper got snatched.

18:15.224 --> 18:16.747
She was on the phone
with her husband.

18:16.791 --> 18:18.358
He's also an employee.

18:18.401 --> 18:20.838
He-he heard a woman
threaten her in Spanish.

18:20.882 --> 18:22.710
Manuela Diaz.

18:22.753 --> 18:24.190
The employeeaccess card can open

18:24.233 --> 18:26.627
just about every doorin the hotel.

18:26.670 --> 18:28.890
She's the Soldados'
escape route.

18:28.933 --> 18:30.761
Name's Ana Rodriguez.

18:30.805 --> 18:32.850
HICKS:
All right, Ana's
our main priority.

18:32.894 --> 18:34.504
Hotel security
has already notified

18:34.548 --> 18:36.332
the guests and staff
to shelter in place.

18:36.376 --> 18:37.681
Including the event
on the top floor

18:37.725 --> 18:39.205
we couldn't
safely evacuate.

18:39.248 --> 18:40.902
How many people in there?Head count's 22.

18:40.945 --> 18:42.469
It's a seminar for start-ups.

18:42.512 --> 18:43.687
They're a smart crowd.
They'll stay put,

18:43.731 --> 18:45.341
doors locked, just
like I told 'em.

18:45.385 --> 18:46.908
And there's privatesecurity inside.

18:46.951 --> 18:48.866
Why is that?Othella Baker's speaking.

18:48.910 --> 18:51.478
She's completelyunder the radar, zero publicity.

18:51.521 --> 18:54.481
Her choice.She's a tech billionaire.
She's never under the radar.

18:54.524 --> 18:55.830
It's a high-profile
target if any

18:55.873 --> 18:57.527
of these crews figure
out she's here.

18:57.571 --> 18:58.659
Just to complicate the day.

18:59.790 --> 19:01.966

19:02.010 --> 19:03.533

Get up!

19:09.322 --> 19:11.367
Move.

19:11.411 --> 19:13.543
Where's that camera?Ninth floor, east wing.

19:13.587 --> 19:15.023
What's your surveillanceback of house?

19:15.066 --> 19:16.807
Only at the street exits,
for inventory control.

19:16.851 --> 19:19.375
What, in case your employees
steal the soap?

19:19.419 --> 19:21.334
It's corporate policy,not mine.

19:21.377 --> 19:23.553
HICKS: All right.So we go old-school.

19:23.597 --> 19:25.381
Roll out and savethe housekeeper.

19:25.425 --> 19:26.817
And, Hondo...

19:26.861 --> 19:28.254

19:28.297 --> 19:30.647
Yes, sir.

19:44.661 --> 19:46.837
[phone ringing]

19:46.881 --> 19:48.665
Yeah.

19:53.017 --> 19:55.933
All right, they're going
for separate staircases.

19:55.977 --> 19:57.413
Splitting up's
good strategy.

19:57.457 --> 19:59.676
I hate the smart ones.You and me both.

19:59.720 --> 20:01.678
All right, we gotthree teams, three gangs.

20:01.722 --> 20:03.767
Hondo, Chris and Street own
Los Soldados, east wing.

20:03.811 --> 20:06.292
Yup.All right, R-Command
to 30-David.

20:06.335 --> 20:08.946
Deacon, you and Tan have
the south wing, One-Niners.

20:08.990 --> 20:11.601
Two tandem suspects,
primary is solo.

20:11.645 --> 20:14.604
50-David, Rocker,
you have the north wing.

Brotherhood--

20:15.823 --> 20:17.781

20:17.825 --> 20:19.740
They're all gonna be looking
for the exits.

20:19.783 --> 20:21.872
Look, I should be
out there with them.

20:21.916 --> 20:24.092
Soon enough.

20:27.182 --> 20:28.705
LAPD! Stop!

20:28.749 --> 20:30.533
Nadie se mueva.Knives down!
Knives down!

20:30.577 --> 20:31.578
[commands in Spanish]

20:32.622 --> 20:33.841
I need to find my wife.

20:33.884 --> 20:35.451
They took Ana.We were on the phone,

20:35.495 --> 20:37.323
and I tried to warn her.What's your name?

20:37.366 --> 20:38.802
RaÃºl Duarte, busboy.

20:38.846 --> 20:40.456
All clear.These are my friendsfrom the kitchen,

20:40.500 --> 20:42.676

20:44.591 --> 20:45.766
Put your
hands down.

20:45.809 --> 20:47.246
I can help you, sir.

20:47.289 --> 20:48.638
No need, RaÃºl.Look, I've worked herefor eight years.

20:48.682 --> 20:50.945
I know this placelike I know my wife's own face.

20:50.988 --> 20:52.729
You have to lookat a map, sir.

20:52.773 --> 20:54.383
Ana is taking themthe slow way out.

20:54.427 --> 20:55.602
She's showing mewhere they are.

20:55.645 --> 20:56.646
How?We all have pens

20:56.690 --> 20:57.865
for the checklists.

20:59.780 --> 21:01.085
See here?

21:01.129 --> 21:02.739
That's the eÃ±emark.

21:02.783 --> 21:04.480
Show me.

21:04.524 --> 21:06.003
Because she calls me "cariÃ±o,"

21:06.047 --> 21:08.354
with the mark over the "N."

21:11.574 --> 21:12.967
It's like saying"honey."

21:13.010 --> 21:14.490
She's leaving hima breadcrumb trail.

21:14.534 --> 21:15.491
She went straight.

21:15.535 --> 21:16.492
We turn here.

21:16.536 --> 21:19.016
We can cut 'em off.

21:20.148 --> 21:22.542
Okay. RaÃºl,
you're with us.

21:22.585 --> 21:24.500
The rest of you,get back in the kitchen

21:24.544 --> 21:25.936

Do it now.

in custody,

21:50.047 --> 21:51.701
not the primary.Where the hell's Cyrus?

21:51.745 --> 21:52.833
There's no sign
of The Brotherhood

21:52.876 --> 21:54.008
or Los Soldados, either.

21:54.051 --> 21:55.226
We control every exit.

21:55.270 --> 21:57.707
Only way out
is cuffed or bagged.

22:00.057 --> 22:02.146

Shame on that shirt.

27:40.310 --> 27:42.965

27:57.937 --> 28:00.069
Oh, she looks stressed.

28:00.113 --> 28:02.071
Is it true Othella
Baker's at risk?

28:02.115 --> 28:04.857
No. She's sheltering in placewith the rest of her seminar.

28:04.900 --> 28:06.423
Why didn't you tell me?
The mayor thinks

28:06.467 --> 28:08.251
I deliberately cut
her out of a loop

28:08.295 --> 28:09.383
I didn't even
know about.

28:09.426 --> 28:11.211
So, then lay the blame on me.

28:11.254 --> 28:13.039
Baker happens to be a personal
friend of the mayor's.

28:13.082 --> 28:14.431

28:18.087 --> 28:19.349
and I don't
like it, either.

28:19.393 --> 28:20.873

I don't have
to do that.

28:42.198 --> 28:43.460
You're not making another call.

You can cooperate,
or you can wish you had.

this guy?

You don't scare easy,

Why didn't you tell me

But I don't know
if I can convince Owen

and-and frankly...

38:14.944 --> 38:17.686

if I should even try.

Deac, when you'rea soldier--

39:07.997 --> 39:11.479
and we are soldiers--

39:11.523 --> 39:15.004
you only got one objectiveevery day when you're deployed:

39:15.048 --> 39:16.919
don't die.

39:17.964 --> 39:19.705
