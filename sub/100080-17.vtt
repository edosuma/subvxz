00:08.399 --> 00:09.705
Uh, Lieutenant,
this is my brother Terry.

00:09.748 --> 00:12.882
Hey, nice
to meet you.Hi.

00:12.925 --> 00:15.667
It's been a long time.Sorry about what I said to you.

00:15.711 --> 00:17.669
Well, you save
people's lives.

00:17.713 --> 00:20.411
I film crime scenes and then
sell 'em to the tabloids.

00:20.455 --> 00:22.848
It's no secret who's got
the more honorable gig.

00:22.892 --> 00:24.676
Thanks for always
having my six.

00:24.720 --> 00:26.156
Yeah. [laughs softly]

00:32.728 --> 00:34.295
[clears throat]

00:34.338 --> 00:36.688
I-I think I... I think
I drank too much whiskey.

00:36.732 --> 00:38.864
Sorry. Chris, I'm sorry.No, no, no. That was my fault.

00:38.908 --> 00:40.823
You and me-- we're teammates.

00:40.866 --> 00:42.694
I'm always gonna haveyour back on the job,

00:42.738 --> 00:44.261
but that's whereit ends from now on.

00:44.305 --> 00:45.828
You're, like,twice as strong as last week.

00:45.871 --> 00:48.222
And half as strong as I was
before getting injured.

00:48.265 --> 00:50.267
I need to be 100% if
I'm gonna pass my PFQ

00:50.311 --> 00:51.790
and get back out in the field.

00:51.834 --> 00:54.271
You're still gonna tryto pass the PFQ?I'm gonna do it.

00:54.315 --> 00:56.273
I just need to be
with my team.

00:56.317 --> 00:57.448
Well, look at that--Buck Spivey.

00:57.492 --> 00:58.710
You look like you're
doing really good.

00:58.754 --> 01:00.451
I'm hooked up with a guynamed Owen Bennett.

01:00.495 --> 01:01.713
And, uh, we're looking

01:01.757 --> 01:03.237
to launch a privatesecurity firm.

01:03.280 --> 01:04.455
But what would really put things

01:04.499 --> 01:05.891
over the top would beto have you on board.

01:05.935 --> 01:07.415
I've struggled a bit
since leaving SWAT.

01:07.458 --> 01:09.547
You owe me.Is that what this is
about-- me owing you?

01:09.591 --> 01:12.159
Because, Buck, it seems
to me that goes both ways.

01:15.684 --> 01:17.773
You realize we're overqualifiedfor this gig, yeah?

01:17.816 --> 01:19.818
Yeah, well, I knowthat every job is important

01:19.862 --> 01:21.385
for a new company like ours.

01:21.429 --> 01:22.995
Lot of competition
in private security.

01:23.039 --> 01:24.823
Promoter likeshow we handle ourselves,

01:24.867 --> 01:26.347
maybe we snaga long-term contract.

01:26.390 --> 01:28.349
So let's justkeep the clients safe.

01:28.392 --> 01:30.307
Right, from rabid
teenyboppers

01:30.351 --> 01:32.353
wasting their parents' moneyon concert tix.

01:32.396 --> 01:33.789
Come on, Deac.

01:33.832 --> 01:35.660
Is "teenyboppers"
even still a word?

01:35.704 --> 01:37.358
Oh, now you're justage-shaming me

01:37.401 --> 01:40.491
with your yogurt parfaitand 30-inch waist.

01:40.535 --> 01:41.971
You enjoy that.

01:42.014 --> 01:43.538
You're crabby today.

01:43.581 --> 01:46.236
Mm. Maybe you're oversensitive?

01:46.280 --> 01:47.542
So, what do you want to do--

01:47.585 --> 01:48.847
go shock-and-awewith a six-man team?

01:48.891 --> 01:50.327
Two-two-and-two on the door?Realistically,

01:50.371 --> 01:51.676
I think we just need
a three-man team

01:51.720 --> 01:53.287
shadowing the client
in and out of the event.

01:53.330 --> 01:55.245
Right. Aka the vanity crew.

01:55.289 --> 01:57.378
You know, our star--he looks tough, plays safe.

01:57.421 --> 01:58.814
He's a wussy. [chuckles]

01:58.857 --> 02:01.947
Wussy from get-upto get-down. Ah.

02:01.991 --> 02:04.036
You doing okay?

02:04.080 --> 02:06.256
Oh, top of the world, Deac.

02:06.300 --> 02:08.389
[laughs]It's just, it ain't SWAT.

02:08.432 --> 02:10.347
Pays better by the hour.

02:10.391 --> 02:11.783
That's what I tell the mirrorevery morning.

02:11.827 --> 02:13.785
[phone beeping]
Oh.

02:13.829 --> 02:15.787
Okay, you're on the clock now,so you and I are done.

02:15.831 --> 02:17.789
You got a big day?Yeah.

02:17.833 --> 02:19.269
Buck.Hey.

02:19.313 --> 02:21.315
Hey, man.He's all yours.

02:22.533 --> 02:24.274
What's going on?

02:24.318 --> 02:25.797
We're muscle
for a joint task force

02:25.841 --> 02:27.364
with the Gang Division.

02:27.408 --> 02:28.974
Yeah? How many...how many targets?

02:29.018 --> 02:31.499
Four different gang leaders,
plus any crew they bring along.

02:31.542 --> 02:34.284
All in one location?Gets them max charges
on conspiracy.

02:34.328 --> 02:36.068
Break the gangs
from the top down.

02:36.112 --> 02:38.419
Well, that seems likea high-risk move.Nah.

02:38.462 --> 02:39.768
That's why we're
gonna let 'em scatter

02:39.811 --> 02:41.248
before we start
picking 'em off.

02:41.291 --> 02:42.858
We'll be in control
of time, place

02:42.901 --> 02:44.381
and the number of players.

02:44.425 --> 02:46.253
All the variables.Well, stay liquid.

02:46.296 --> 02:47.558
Drown the suckers.[laughs]

02:47.602 --> 02:49.604
Really glad to see you, man.

02:51.606 --> 02:53.825
All right, so, Buck,
you'll handle the...

02:53.869 --> 02:55.566
Oh, yeah.Don't you worry, Deac.

02:55.610 --> 02:58.743
I got the, uh...
I got the side job covered.

03:03.008 --> 03:04.836
Dude, you're not missing
anything.

03:04.880 --> 03:06.577
All-day stakeout
beats maybe--

03:06.621 --> 03:08.710
I don't know-- dental work?

03:08.753 --> 03:10.451
Until you roll up
on the targets.

03:10.494 --> 03:12.931
All right, that's-that'sthe bonus. I won't lie.

03:12.975 --> 03:14.629
Yeah, while I'm watching
spy monitors.

03:14.672 --> 03:15.978
Hey.

03:16.021 --> 03:17.762
You're back in the field again.

03:17.806 --> 03:18.937
Well, watching the field
and being

03:18.981 --> 03:20.330
in the field
ain't the same thing,

03:20.374 --> 03:21.592
so don't pat me
on the back

03:21.636 --> 03:23.594
like I'm some kind
of needy girl.

03:23.638 --> 03:26.380
Should I, uh, walk outand come in again?

03:26.423 --> 03:27.816
Sorry. I'm sorry.No.

03:27.859 --> 03:29.121
I get it. I get it.

03:29.165 --> 03:31.472
I-I've had my share
of needy girls.

03:31.515 --> 03:33.952
They just don't look like you.Yeah.

03:33.996 --> 03:35.345
Hey.Yeah.

03:35.389 --> 03:36.607
I miss you out there.

03:36.651 --> 03:39.958
Well, I'm almost on deck, man.

03:40.002 --> 03:42.439
Just need to pass the PFQ.

03:42.483 --> 03:44.615
Just like all the other times.

03:44.659 --> 03:46.400
Yeah?

03:49.881 --> 03:52.449
Well, I got your backs out theretoday, so don't-don't...

03:52.493 --> 03:54.408
don't make it hardon me now, all right?

03:54.451 --> 03:55.670
All right.

03:55.713 --> 03:57.672
What the hell was that about?

03:57.715 --> 03:59.804
He's just scared.If he can't pass...

03:59.848 --> 04:01.893
I mean, SWAT is in his DNA.

04:01.937 --> 04:04.853
Unless it isn't anymore.
And then what?

04:04.896 --> 04:07.551
Third-generation SWAT
just washes out?

04:07.595 --> 04:10.337

[clears throat]

Even if Luca had to go
desk, he's still SWAT.

Is that how you'd feel?

04:20.825 --> 04:22.349
No.

04:22.392 --> 04:23.915
Me, neither.

04:23.959 --> 04:26.004
So, how's everything
with Molly?

04:26.048 --> 04:29.573
Good. I, uh...I never thanked you.

04:29.617 --> 04:31.749
Molly told me thatyou were encouraging

04:31.793 --> 04:33.490
when she asked you about me.

04:33.534 --> 04:35.492
She wasn't supposed
to tell you that.

04:35.536 --> 04:39.366
I-I got to say,I was a little surprised,

04:39.409 --> 04:42.934
given the circumstances...No. Don't. Don't.

04:42.978 --> 04:45.807
You and me--
we-we... we had a moment.

04:45.850 --> 04:48.636
A mini, drunken moment.

04:48.679 --> 04:50.681
And a bad idea.
