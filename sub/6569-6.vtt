00:28.295 --> 00:29.535
Oh, my God. Those protesters

00:29.630 --> 00:31.632
shouldn't be allowed so close.

00:31.698 --> 00:33.507
They’re just regular people, like you, Gary.

00:33.567 --> 00:34.671

GARY: Let me tell you
that when you announce 7,000 jobs,

00:37.638 --> 00:39.379
they're gonna be fanning you
with those signs.

00:39.640 --> 00:41.984

- You're gonna be like the "fairy job-mother."

00:42.042 --> 00:43.043
SELINA: (CHUCKLES) Yeah.

I want Selina's job announcement

00:46.313 --> 00:48.919
I want to hear the Discovery Channel say,
"We interrupt these sharks."

00:49.016 --> 00:51.656
Yeah, you know what? Thanks for sending me
the speech, Mike. It's perfect...

00:51.718 --> 00:53.026
- Great.
-  ...ly shit.

Hey, Dan, why not put
the Mike hazing on pause

00:58.859 --> 01:01.066
and tell us why we're bringing
Selina's personal trainer everywhere?

01:01.161 --> 01:03.437
Because, Amy, trainers help
release endorphins. Okay?

01:03.530 --> 01:04.736
I think it's a good idea.

01:04.831 --> 01:06.674

- Yeah, I got it. You can go.
- Okay.

03:25.839 --> 03:27.716

03:27.808 --> 03:29.378
with the retractable ones,
and that is what I would like.

03:29.476 --> 03:30.887
Sir, we only have them on lanyards.

03:30.977 --> 03:33.048
I understand that you
only have them on lanyards.

03:33.146 --> 03:35.422

Minimum four-second handshake.

03:50.030 --> 03:52.943
Minimum six-second handshake,
and I want a toothy smile.

03:53.033 --> 03:55.570
Perfect. 'Cause we've got to prove
they don't hate each other.

03:55.669 --> 03:58.047
- Absolutely.
- Okay. And this is it.

03:58.105 --> 03:59.243
- This is it.
- That's it.

03:59.339 --> 04:00.682

- This is it.

04:02.075 --> 04:04.077
- Now, I don't want any funny business, Mike.
- No funny business.

04:04.177 --> 04:05.417
- I'll keep an eye on you.
- Oh.

04:05.512 --> 04:07.685
Did you see this? Look at this action. Ka-pow!

04:07.848 --> 04:10.692
This handshake is gonna show
that there is no Maddox-Meyer feud. Okay?

04:10.751 --> 04:13.698
And if there was, by the way,
it would be a "Meyer-Maddox" feud.

04:13.754 --> 04:16.291
Yeah, yeah. She would go first. That's right.

04:17.023 --> 04:20.560
So, Amy, how's not being campaign manager
not working out for you?

04:21.928 --> 04:23.407
- Really, it's fine.
- Hmm.

04:23.463 --> 04:26.307
Selina and I have developed
such a good friendship over the years

04:26.399 --> 04:28.106
that she tells me everything, anyway.

04:28.268 --> 04:30.646
I never pegged you two as friends.

04:30.737 --> 04:32.808
You know, you always seem
kind of tense around her.

04:33.140 --> 04:34.949
I look tense,

04:35.041 --> 04:36.884
because, yes... Because I...

04:36.943 --> 04:38.286
Well, one, I have broad shoulders.

04:38.378 --> 04:39.948
And two, because...

04:40.046 --> 04:42.652
That's the job.
The job is what makes me look tense.

04:42.749 --> 04:44.558
But underneath all the work tension,

04:44.618 --> 04:46.461
I'm really very relaxed.

04:46.553 --> 04:48.794
Have you heard about Emily Lafuente?

04:48.889 --> 04:49.890
It is so awful.

04:49.956 --> 04:51.958
Such a tragic thing.

04:52.092 --> 04:54.504
I'm sorry to say, in your country
you have too many guns.

04:54.895 --> 04:57.273
Way too many.
But I think we have a little problem,

04:57.330 --> 04:58.502
and it's called the Second Amendment.

04:59.232 --> 05:01.269
People think it's their birthright, you see.

05:01.401 --> 05:02.903
To give guns to babies?

05:03.570 --> 05:05.015
Well, only in Arizona.

05:06.573 --> 05:07.608
- Minna, I've made a joke.
- I know!

05:07.674 --> 05:11.520
And me also, I made a joke
for giving the guns to the babies.

05:11.611 --> 05:14.182
Because I know you don't give
the guns to the babies.

05:14.281 --> 05:15.487
No, of course not.

05:15.582 --> 05:16.993
- It would be dangerous.
- Yeah. Bang!

05:17.083 --> 05:18.585
- No, it would be awful. No.
- Awful.

05:18.652 --> 05:19.653
- Amy, Amy.
- AMY: Yes?

05:19.753 --> 05:20.754

05:20.821 --> 05:22.494
- he practically fixed my shoulder.
- I see.

05:22.823 --> 05:24.496
- Oh.
- And he's not just a personal trainer,

05:24.591 --> 05:26.628
- he's like a personal Jesus.
- Mmm.

05:26.693 --> 05:29.139
Maybe he could really help you
with, you know, your... Mmm...

05:29.196 --> 05:30.334
Well, really everything, actually.

05:30.430 --> 05:31.636
What are you talking about?

05:31.698 --> 05:34.201
I've been watching you.
I see all of this tension.

05:34.301 --> 05:36.611
Where do you want to start, neck or spine?

05:37.003 --> 05:38.505
I could break both, if you'd like.

05:38.605 --> 05:39.811
All right, well.

05:40.140 --> 05:41.778
- I dig a challenge.
- Yeah.

05:41.842 --> 05:43.321
Well, maybe you should

05:43.376 --> 05:45.185
work on North Korea first, get them to relax,

05:45.278 --> 05:47.315
- and then work your way up Amy.

Actually, no.

We were talking about
the sad death of Emily Lafuente.

06:07.167 --> 06:09.044
Just so sad. I hate murder.

06:09.135 --> 06:10.375
In fact, I agreed with Selina

06:10.470 --> 06:12.211
that she said
the Second Amendment you have,

06:12.305 --> 06:14.478
it's really a problem.
You have far too many guns here.

the lights and see?

06:32.392 --> 06:33.735
- Can I trust you?
- I don't know. Can you?

06:33.994 --> 06:35.371
(SELINA LAUGHING)

06:35.562 --> 06:36.597
All right. Turn it over.

- RAY: Come on. Almost there.

06:44.604 --> 06:48.017
Just need you to sign off on this statement
for the murdered journalist, ma'am.

06:48.208 --> 06:49.778
Emily Lafuente...

06:49.876 --> 06:51.378
What? I cant read what that says.
What does that say?

06:51.444 --> 06:52.787
"Lived life to the full."

06:52.879 --> 06:54.358
SELINA: "And we will miss her distinct voice."

06:54.414 --> 06:55.620
Seems a bit stiff to me.

06:55.715 --> 06:57.854
- It does? Do you think?
- Yeah. How about, uh,

06:58.752 --> 07:00.754
"When she wrote the world listened."

07:01.521 --> 07:02.465
Ooh, I like that.

07:02.555 --> 07:03.693

- Yeah.
- Yeah.

Okay.

- Thanks, Mike.
- SELINA: Thank you.

07:07.594 --> 07:08.595
Guess I can work with that.

07:08.695 --> 07:10.538
- How much more do I have to do?
- Come on, I'll let you know.

consultant part time.

- MIKE: Her jobs speech.

07:21.574 --> 07:22.712
Can I see?

07:24.878 --> 07:26.118
What is "Marimba America?"

07:26.212 --> 07:28.920
Marimba, that alarm that's on
your phone when you wake up.

07:28.982 --> 07:30.552
It's like, "Wake up, America!"

07:30.617 --> 07:32.062
They don't give a shit.

07:32.118 --> 07:33.620
You need a sound bite.

I wrote a sound bite once
and had the entire crowd in tears.

- Seriously, isn't that incredible?

07:44.597 --> 07:45.803
- Ready, almost?
- Here, Amy, touch this.

- What I...

07:47.167 --> 07:49.169
- I don't want to... I can see...
- No, touch it.

07:49.269 --> 07:50.805
- GARY: Look at that.
- That's nice, ma'am.

07:50.904 --> 07:51.974
- GARY: Look at you.

07:52.072 --> 07:54.143
You're gonna do your own fitness video.

07:54.474 --> 07:56.317
I can improve your posture 8,000%.

07:56.409 --> 07:57.353
GARY: Oh, my God.

07:57.444 --> 07:59.424
Well, so can I. I can just take off my shoes.
(LAUGHS)

07:59.746 --> 08:01.191
I don't give up.

08:01.281 --> 08:02.282
Gary, you're next.

08:02.349 --> 08:03.919
Ah. I'm ready to receive it.

08:04.250 --> 08:05.194
Got to get my oil.

08:05.285 --> 08:06.320
Ah! I love the oil.

08:06.419 --> 08:07.591
Sandalwood or chamomile?

08:07.654 --> 08:09.656
Wood, please. I'll do the wood.

08:10.323 --> 08:12.098
- Um, Ame?
- Yes?

08:12.158 --> 08:14.968
Can I talk to you really quick,
just friend to friend, just for a second?

08:15.028 --> 08:17.372
AMY: I like to think of us as friends
sometimes, too. (CHUCKLING)

08:18.264 --> 08:20.039
I spend more time with you
than any of my other friends.

08:20.133 --> 08:21.168
That technically makes you

08:21.267 --> 08:22.678
my best friend.

08:22.769 --> 08:23.804
What do you think of Ray?

08:25.305 --> 08:28.616
I think that he is an effective temporary hire.

08:28.808 --> 08:30.617
I think he's kind of cute. Do you?

08:30.710 --> 08:32.849
Yeah. Yeah, he's very cute.

08:32.946 --> 08:33.947
We're fucking.

08:34.114 --> 08:35.115
Uh-huh...

08:36.616 --> 08:39.495
Don't worry. I can, uh, get rid of that

08:39.552 --> 08:41.828
in a matter of an hour.

08:42.188 --> 08:43.861
- No, no, no.
- The chicken's off the menu.

08:43.957 --> 08:45.994
What? No. (STUTTERING)

08:46.059 --> 08:47.299
I don't want to get rid of him.

08:47.360 --> 08:49.362
Why do you think I would
want to get rid of him?

08:49.896 --> 08:52.877
Um... Because you want to be president?

08:53.133 --> 08:56.342
Well, I mean, I can get rid of him then.

08:56.403 --> 08:58.246
I guess. I just wanted you to know.

08:58.338 --> 09:00.215
But I don't want anybody else to know, okay?

09:00.306 --> 09:01.808
Especially Dan. Oh, my God.

09:02.075 --> 09:05.648
No, no, 'cause he'll be,
"Oh, a crisis. I need a third iPad."

09:05.712 --> 09:07.419
DAN: We need to get her on stage faster.

09:08.181 --> 09:10.058
I don't know. Use a jet pack. Hold on.

09:10.150 --> 09:12.096
Mike, why would you send me this shit?

09:12.485 --> 09:16.194
I mean, you might as well have just sat
on the fuckin' keyboard and sent me that.

09:16.256 --> 09:17.257
I wrote it.

09:17.757 --> 09:18.758
Oh.

09:19.492 --> 09:22.496
I mean, well, it's got some good bits.
We just got to tweak it a little.

09:22.695 --> 09:25.266
Yes, yes, she's got to get off
the stage fast too.

09:25.365 --> 09:27.242
Well, stick her in a cannon. I don't know.

09:29.069 --> 09:30.742
So, Gary,

09:30.837 --> 09:32.612
you know how when a trainer

09:32.705 --> 09:35.413
and a vice president
love each other very much?

09:35.508 --> 09:36.578
They're having sex.

09:36.676 --> 09:39.247
- Oh, you know. Ah.
- Yeah, I figured it out.

09:39.512 --> 09:41.287
I mean, look at him, you know? Look at her!

09:41.381 --> 09:42.917
- My God.
- What are you guys talking about?

09:43.516 --> 09:45.291
- The jobs speech.
- Yeah.

09:45.418 --> 09:46.920
Oh, Selina and Ray fucking?

09:47.020 --> 09:48.727
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I thought so.

09:48.788 --> 09:50.392
Well, watch and learn.

09:50.557 --> 09:53.037
Hey, Mrs. Meyer.

09:53.526 --> 09:54.869
So Turville Industries

09:55.361 --> 09:56.704
got a big jobs announcement?

09:56.763 --> 09:57.764
SELINA: Yeah. Ben!

09:57.864 --> 10:01.107
Can we slap another restraining order
on this creepy bellboy?

10:01.201 --> 10:02.145
BEN: No problem.

10:02.235 --> 10:03.805
DAN: See that?
BEN: Or how about a drone strike?

10:05.238 --> 10:08.811
I don't know what you said to her,
but I'm going to find out.

10:08.908 --> 10:09.943
You did this?

10:10.043 --> 10:12.080
Oh, come on,
we all know Andrew's terrible for her.

10:12.145 --> 10:13.419
So I sourced Ray.

10:13.480 --> 10:14.720
He's her new chew toy.

10:14.781 --> 10:16.488
You're a sex trafficker now.

10:16.583 --> 10:18.756
- How low can you go?
- Well, however low it is, Amy,

10:18.818 --> 10:20.263
- I'm still higher than you.
- (AMY SCOFFS)

10:20.320 --> 10:22.891
Okay, listen.
I'm not saying Ray is good enough for Selina.

10:22.956 --> 10:25.061
I'm just saying I really, really like Ray.

10:25.125 --> 10:26.900
We know. You're Ray-curious.

10:26.960 --> 10:28.234
Okay, I don't know what that's about.

I get it.

understand smart-guy world, huh?"

10:39.839 --> 10:40.840
Eh.

10:40.940 --> 10:42.510
Sorry, I didn't mean to strike a nerve there.

10:42.609 --> 10:45.180
You didn't strike a nerve. I'm just saying.

10:46.146 --> 10:47.955
Because you're in shape
doesn't mean you don't know

10:48.014 --> 10:50.688
that "IMF" means "International Money Fund."

10:50.783 --> 10:51.853
"Monetary."

- You punched that motherfucker.

13:28.808 --> 13:30.310
Maybe I did say that to her.

But there was no reason for her
to be talking about it.

14:48.321 --> 14:50.028

14:50.089 --> 14:51.329
There's something she needs to know.

- She's practicing her speech.

Oh, my God.

That is not your shoe.

Hey.

You must be Andrew.

15:16.215 --> 15:18.092

No, I'm Ray. I'm Selina's wellness advisor.

The Pilates made your shirt fly off?

15:23.055 --> 15:24.693
You do need to put some clothes on, okay?

15:25.124 --> 15:26.262
CATHERINE: Mom, not the help.

15:26.359 --> 15:27.702
Jesus, that's tacky.

15:28.060 --> 15:30.563
What's with the patronizing?
I've got two gyms and a shake business.

15:30.630 --> 15:31.608
Yeah.

15:31.697 --> 15:34.871
Have you no dignity,
or do you order that in as well?

15:35.268 --> 15:36.872
Oh, wow!

15:37.303 --> 15:38.782
- Unbelievable!
- ANDREW: Is it?

15:38.871 --> 15:41.283
Okay, everybody is very tired,
it was a long day.

15:41.374 --> 15:42.978
Nobody likes sex, let's disperse.

15:43.075 --> 15:45.646
And there is a jazz trio downstairs
that's fantastic.

15:45.745 --> 15:47.247
- Who likes jazz?
- I love jazz.

15:47.313 --> 15:49.054
Kenny G can blow the storm up.

15:49.115 --> 15:50.890
Great. I was talking about the others.

15:50.950 --> 15:52.896
We are going to need a bigger hallway.

15:53.586 --> 15:55.429
Oh, my God, it's the Finnish funnel mouth.

15:55.488 --> 15:58.435
- Madam Vice President.
- Madam Ex-Prime Minister.

15:58.491 --> 15:59.469
Hello.

15:59.559 --> 16:02.096
I wish to express my deepest

16:02.161 --> 16:04.937
and most profound regret
for what happened today.

16:05.097 --> 16:06.405
- Right.
- There is,

16:06.499 --> 16:09.002
on your team,
a leaking gentleman.

16:09.101 --> 16:10.136
What? Who?

16:10.236 --> 16:11.237
- On your team.
- Who on my team?

16:11.304 --> 16:12.749
I don't know his name,

16:12.805 --> 16:14.182
but he is like

16:14.273 --> 16:19.347
in central Europe there is a bad companion
for Santa Claus.

16:19.445 --> 16:22.449
He comes on Christmas
and if the children are naughty,

16:22.515 --> 16:24.654
he takes away the presents.

16:24.750 --> 16:25.785
Rudolph.

16:25.952 --> 16:28.364
No, no. It's like a man,

16:28.454 --> 16:29.694
but it's very tall.

16:29.789 --> 16:30.790
- Jonah!
- It's Jonah.

16:30.923 --> 16:32.334
- Oh, it's Jonah?
- He's not on our team.

16:32.425 --> 16:33.836
At all. No.

16:34.427 --> 16:35.667
I am so sorry.

16:35.761 --> 16:38.367
But I would like you to understand

16:38.464 --> 16:41.274
that in my country,
politics is a lot more honest.

16:41.467 --> 16:44.277
In your country, people fuck snow.

16:44.937 --> 16:46.143
And I hope you understand

16:46.205 --> 16:48.378
that I say that with the utmost respect.

16:48.474 --> 16:49.953
(STAMMERING)

16:50.009 --> 16:51.852
I'm under enormous pressure

16:51.944 --> 16:54.686
having been attacked by the Statue of Liberty,

16:54.780 --> 16:55.724
earlier this day...

16:55.815 --> 16:56.953
No, no.

16:58.117 --> 16:59.494
- I am so sorry.
- Thank you. Yes.

16:59.552 --> 17:00.553
- Thank you.
- Good night. Good night.

17:00.653 --> 17:03.691
Good night. And my room is just next door.

17:03.789 --> 17:04.790
Oh, great.

17:04.857 --> 17:08.236
I want for your comfort to make you aware
that today I purchased ear pligs.

17:08.327 --> 17:09.396
- Ear plugs-
- Ear plugs-

17:09.494 --> 17:10.530
Oh, ear plugs. Okay.

17:10.630 --> 17:13.406
- Not every country likes to eavesdrop.
- (RAY LAUGHS)

17:13.965 --> 17:14.910
Yes.

17:15.001 --> 17:17.378
- No, it's a joke. Finnish joke.
- Yeah, it's a good one.

17:17.470 --> 17:18.471
No, we got it.

17:18.538 --> 17:19.846
- Sweet dreams.
- Sweet dreams.

17:21.173 --> 17:22.516
Okay.

17:23.675 --> 17:24.746
Who needs what?

17:24.844 --> 17:25.982
You go first.

17:26.045 --> 17:28.047
Well, to begin with,
I was coming to talk to you

17:28.146 --> 17:29.922
about the fact that
Dan has me doing all these...

17:30.016 --> 17:32.189
Great. You must now go
and speak with Dan, not to me.

17:32.652 --> 17:33.653
Next.

17:33.719 --> 17:35.562
I came up... You know what?

17:35.655 --> 17:36.998
Forget it.

17:37.557 --> 17:40.094
- Music to my ears, Andrew.
- Yeah, yeah.

17:43.062 --> 17:44.405
- Try these Perch balls.
- Ooh.

17:44.497 --> 17:45.567
CATHERINE: Dan?

17:45.665 --> 17:49.078
I am not going to talk to radio stations
that have eagles in the logo

17:49.168 --> 17:50.909
or call themselves the "voice of reason."

17:52.071 --> 17:53.243
SELINA: Yes, let me...

17:53.739 --> 17:54.911
- Ah. Ma'am...
- SELINA: Hold on a second.

17:55.007 --> 17:56.418
We're reaching out
to the gun lobby right now.

17:56.509 --> 17:57.920
Mike has written a speech that I think

17:58.010 --> 17:59.580
should neutralize the entire issue.

17:59.679 --> 18:00.680
Ninth draft.

18:00.746 --> 18:03.249
Uh, great. Okay, everybody listen up.

18:03.716 --> 18:06.788
Ray has got kind of a fabulous idea, I think.
Go.

18:07.286 --> 18:09.926
The vice president goes to a gun show.

18:10.790 --> 18:12.030
- What?
- What?

18:12.525 --> 18:14.266
You mean the Wayne County Gun Fair,
ma'am?

18:14.360 --> 18:15.566
- Yes. That's the one.
- That's the one.

18:15.628 --> 18:16.606
Good for you, Sue.

18:16.696 --> 18:18.698
- This is a gun show for women.
- That's right.

18:18.764 --> 18:20.471
Women with guns are less threatening,
ma'am.

18:20.566 --> 18:23.046
Yeah, exactly, because they're not nut jobs.

18:23.102 --> 18:24.308
Case in point, by the way.

18:24.403 --> 18:26.542
This could be good, "Feminism Reloaded."

18:27.039 --> 18:28.313
There's no time.

18:28.407 --> 18:30.284
SUE: <i>No, there is time, Dan.
You can do this, ma'am.</i>

18:30.376 --> 18:31.377
<i>We'll have to push the speech back</i>

18:31.444 --> 18:33.253
30 minutes. So you'll need to be fast.

18:33.312 --> 18:35.553
Yeah, fine. I can be fast. (GIGGLES)

18:36.048 --> 18:38.255
Well, I'm not going to a fucking gun show.

18:38.718 --> 18:41.164
Uh, well, yes, you are going
to a "fucking gun show,"

18:41.253 --> 18:42.960
even if I have to put a gun
to your fucking head.

18:43.055 --> 18:44.432
DAN: Okay, we can make this work.

18:44.490 --> 18:47.130
We do shake, show, speech all in 90 minutes.

18:47.226 --> 18:48.671
You know what? Today is the day

18:48.761 --> 18:50.741
that Selina Meyer's campaign begins.

18:50.796 --> 18:51.934
- You say that once a week.
- (ALL CLAPPING)

18:52.098 --> 18:53.441
We're gonna need road maps.

18:53.499 --> 18:54.978
Scramble 30 extra cops,

18:55.067 --> 18:56.307
tell my mother to push

18:56.402 --> 18:58.814
the weekly call to Wednesday
and let's plan this beast.

18:59.105 --> 19:01.415
- Oh. We're gonna need cookies, too.
- (SUE LAUGHS)

19:02.074 --> 19:03.109
(TALKING INDISTINCTLY)

19:03.175 --> 19:04.779
SELINA: I can't hold this.
MIKE: You ready, ma'am?

19:04.910 --> 19:06.981
Yeah, but he's on my good side.
I need to be on that side.

19:07.079 --> 19:08.023
No, that is your good side.

19:08.114 --> 19:10.492
Why can't you ever remember
what my good side is?

19:10.583 --> 19:11.653
No, this...

19:11.751 --> 19:12.957
- SELINA: Hey, George.
- Hey.

19:13.019 --> 19:14.589
- Do you mind if I stand here?
- Madam Vice President.

19:14.654 --> 19:15.655
Sure, sure, go ahead.

19:15.755 --> 19:17.029
- Great.
- How are you doing?

19:17.123 --> 19:18.261
I was really, really worried.

19:18.324 --> 19:19.325
Don't be worried.

19:19.425 --> 19:20.961
- Have you been fishing?
- Doing a little bit.

19:21.027 --> 19:22.529
You know, I'm trying to reel that big one in.

19:22.928 --> 19:24.305
- Fantastic.
- Yeah.

19:25.264 --> 19:26.368
You know, ma'am'
I think we need to get going

19:26.932 --> 19:28.605
- Okay, guys, that's it.
- Okay, got to go. I'll see you...

19:28.668 --> 19:31.274
Three, two, one... Boom!

19:31.370 --> 19:32.371
(CAMERA SH UTTERS CLICKING)

19:34.373 --> 19:36.979
Okay, that's it. Okay, show's over, all right?

19:37.109 --> 19:38.952
You got your TIFFs and your JPEGs. No more.

19:39.145 --> 19:40.453
(SIRENS WAILING)

19:41.781 --> 19:43.226
AMY: "Veep's campaign needs

19:43.315 --> 19:44.726
- "a helping hand."
- DAN: Jesus.

19:45.117 --> 19:47.723
How the fuck do you
screw up a handshake, Mike?

19:47.820 --> 19:49.026
It's four fingers and a thumb.

19:49.121 --> 19:51.328
Jonah had a good idea.
We never planned for that.

19:51.390 --> 19:52.733
Yeah, great hand job, pal.

19:52.825 --> 19:54.133
Okay, you guys,

19:54.193 --> 19:55.467
can we calm down?

19:55.528 --> 19:57.701
We're about to go to a roomful of guns.

19:57.797 --> 20:00.038
I don't think we're exactly
in the right headspace.

20:00.132 --> 20:01.475
- Yeah. That's...
- That's a good point.

20:01.567 --> 20:02.875
SELINA: Oh, yeah, we are!

20:02.968 --> 20:04.208
Oh, yeah!

20:04.837 --> 20:05.838
You're gonna be great.

20:06.305 --> 20:08.251
All right, shut your mouth
and then shut the road.

20:08.340 --> 20:10.047
And if you don't like my tone,

20:10.142 --> 20:12.213
you're really not going to like
Guantanamo Bay.

20:12.311 --> 20:14.188
ETA, 3.9 minutes.

20:14.880 --> 20:17.019
Okay, ma'am, you need to be
conservative and liberal.

20:17.083 --> 20:18.061
- Okay?
- What?

20:18.150 --> 20:20.221
- So, look at guns, but don't touch guns.
- Oh, God.

20:20.319 --> 20:22.560
You know what?
Don't even say the word "gun."

20:22.655 --> 20:24.328
Use words like "protection" or "assurance."

20:24.390 --> 20:27.860
But in context. Don't say,
"Freeze, or I'll protect your fucking head off."

20:27.927 --> 20:28.997
- Yeah.
- Madam Vice President.

20:29.095 --> 20:31.268
- We're so glad you're okay.
- Oh, I'm fine.

20:31.363 --> 20:34.276
Thanks for coming.
It really means a lot to us "Ladies Who Load."

20:36.068 --> 20:37.069
Thank you.

20:37.536 --> 20:38.571
Oh, wow.

20:38.738 --> 20:41.082
Look at this well-defended picnic table.
(LAUGHS)

20:41.173 --> 20:42.174
Yes.

20:42.241 --> 20:44.016
Covered in all these...

20:44.543 --> 20:45.783
Things that defend.

20:46.078 --> 20:48.183
And look at that one. It's so tiny.

20:49.281 --> 20:50.760
Okay, I'm going to tell you
something so uncanny.

20:50.850 --> 20:54.297
This color is exactly Catherine's
favorite color when she was a little girl.

20:54.620 --> 20:55.894
Look here, honey.

20:55.955 --> 20:58.765
Although this would not have been
a good present for her,

20:58.858 --> 21:02.067
'cause she was a toddler with a temper.
She was so mad.

21:02.695 --> 21:04.868
- I wasn't. I...
- Just say you were mad. Doesn't matter.

21:04.964 --> 21:06.466
- These are, like, tommy guns.
- Yeah.

21:06.565 --> 21:07.771
Yeah, from an old-timey movie.

21:07.867 --> 21:09.710
- Don't you love the old-timey movies?
- "Oh, don't shoot!"

21:10.703 --> 21:11.704
Could I get a selfie?

21:12.204 --> 21:14.115
Oh, absolutely. Of course you can. Yeah.

21:15.374 --> 21:16.375
What? Oh.

21:17.376 --> 21:18.582
- There you go.
- Thank you. (LAUGHING)

Perfect. Is it good? I hope it's good.

21:21.881 --> 21:23.224
We got to go. Come on, honey bunny.

21:23.282 --> 21:27.458
And this one is upside down, so,
if you were doing a back bend or something...

21:27.553 --> 21:29.590
Someone's face is on a T-shirt.

21:29.655 --> 21:30.656
Are you kidding me?

I wish my daughter
could bust heads like you, young lady.

21:35.127 --> 21:36.299
Is that my face?

21:36.395 --> 21:38.898
Yeah, it is. Wow.

21:39.165 --> 21:40.769
She is not gonna like that.

21:40.833 --> 21:42.437
She's an adult.

21:42.501 --> 21:44.412
Are you talking about Catherine or Selina?

All right. GO left on Jefferson.

22:01.821 --> 22:03.459
We fixed the traffic lights.

22:03.522 --> 22:05.968
We diverted a parade for Polish Americans.

22:06.091 --> 22:07.866
We've put more oops on the route.

22:07.960 --> 22:10.941
I've seen that part of town.
There's nothing down there worth stealing.

- Dad!
- ANDREW: Hi. Selina?

22:16.302 --> 22:18.213
Oh, my God. What is up with you?

22:18.304 --> 22:20.545
- Kitchen's closed. Okay?
- No, this is about the Turville jobs.

22:20.773 --> 22:21.877
What about the Turville jobs?

22:21.974 --> 22:25.649
I've got some buddies on the board
and I hear they are defaulting on their loans.

22:25.711 --> 22:27.349
They've got six months, tops.

22:28.647 --> 22:31.355
I would have told you last night,
but you had Ray's cock in your ear.

22:31.450 --> 22:32.895
Wait a minute. Do you understand?

22:32.985 --> 22:35.898
I'm about to announce the 7,000 Turville jobs.

22:35.988 --> 22:38.161
There won't be any in six months.

22:38.290 --> 22:40.201
- What am I supposed to do?
- MIKE: Talk about the GDP.

22:40.292 --> 22:41.532
Nobody knows what that means.

22:41.627 --> 22:43.072
- Do you know what that means?
- Yes, I...

- Okay, what?
- I've got Kent on the phone.

22:45.531 --> 22:47.807
I think I put it on speaker,
but I might have taken a photo instead.

22:47.867 --> 22:49.141
Give this to me.

22:56.809 --> 22:59.016
No need to announce the jobs that aren't jobs.

- Thank you, Kent.
- AMY: Yay!

23:00.346 --> 23:01.416
Good to hear.

23:01.513 --> 23:03.493

about something they don't know.

- Exactly right.
- Okay. Well, that's a...

23:05.851 --> 23:07.592
Who's the panel chair' do we know?

23:07.686 --> 23:08.824
I don't know. I can look it up...

23:08.888 --> 23:11.164
Oh, my God. It's the big bad "wilf."

23:21.867 --> 23:23.039
- Hello.
- Hello.

23:24.503 --> 23:25.880
MINNA: Thank you very much.

23:25.938 --> 23:28.043
- Thank you very much.
- Oh, thank you.

23:28.674 --> 23:31.712
It's so nice to be here with friends here.

23:31.777 --> 23:33.882
And, of course, a dear friend right next to me.

23:33.946 --> 23:35.550
Yes, we have met twice.

23:36.382 --> 23:38.419
- Sit down, please.
- Yes. Thank you.

23:38.517 --> 23:39.518
Thank you.

23:40.519 --> 23:42.590
So I have been asked...

23:42.688 --> 23:45.259
No... Told, is more accurate

23:45.357 --> 23:49.931
that I must mention that you have
a very exciting announcement

23:50.029 --> 23:51.235
to make.

23:54.867 --> 23:55.937
You know,

23:56.035 --> 23:59.107
it's funny.
I really today wanted to talk with you

23:59.204 --> 24:00.979
and our group here

24:01.073 --> 24:02.882
about the big picture.

24:03.809 --> 24:07.985
You know? The American landscape
that we're all in today.

24:08.080 --> 24:10.458
That's son of the conversation
that I'm interested in having

24:10.549 --> 24:12.551
with you and with our friends.

24:12.718 --> 24:13.719
But there is also a very

24:13.786 --> 24:16.790
particular announcement
that you wish to make?

24:16.889 --> 24:19.130
Yeah, but I really wanted to talk about

24:19.224 --> 24:23.229
the inspirational entrepreneurs I met.

24:23.295 --> 24:27.004
The men and women
who are behind the umbrella skeleton.

24:27.099 --> 24:29.739
If you think about the engineering of it,

24:29.802 --> 24:32.942
it's a beautiful thing to behold,
and it's something upon which we rely.

24:33.005 --> 24:34.746
MIN NA: It is written there,
what you wish to say.

24:34.807 --> 24:36.650
Well, actually. speaking of writing...

24:36.742 --> 24:38.813
Now, I hope you don't mind
my mentioning this,

24:38.911 --> 24:41.915
but you have written a book. Have you not?

24:42.014 --> 24:43.288
<i>The Finnish Wolf,</i>

24:43.349 --> 24:46.193
which sounds quite intriguing.
And I'm interested...

24:46.285 --> 24:47.923
I don't understand. Do you want me to make

24:47.987 --> 24:49.933
the announcement about Turville Industries?

24:50.089 --> 24:52.160
No, it's okay. Fine. Yeah. Um...

24:52.825 --> 24:55.328
Well, we formed a partnership
with Turville Industries,

24:55.427 --> 24:57.373
and I'd like to announce

24:57.463 --> 25:00.444
that there are gonna be some new jobs
in the Detroit area.

25:04.370 --> 25:05.440
Yeah, but

25:05.504 --> 25:09.111
it’s just one component in the overall picture.
It's not a big deal

25:09.174 --> 25:10.175
in and of itself,

25:10.275 --> 25:11.652
just to be quite clear about it.

25:11.710 --> 25:12.882
Oh, no. No.

25:12.978 --> 25:15.049
It is 7,000 new jobs.

25:15.147 --> 25:16.217
That is 7,000..

25:19.151 --> 25:20.630
Please, stand. Don't be so modest.

25:24.056 --> 25:25.660
I think that people will remember the names

25:25.724 --> 25:29.069
Selina Meyer and Turville Industries
for a very long time.

25:33.165 --> 25:36.203
Well, if we kill everybody in the room
then we might be okay.

25:36.301 --> 25:37.746
Yeah. Can I kill Minna first?

25:37.836 --> 25:39.543
I stole a pistol from the gun show.

25:39.638 --> 25:41.584
You won't have lied for six months.

25:42.374 --> 25:44.911
Oh, that's true. I appreciate that point. Yeah.

25:45.010 --> 25:46.353
Hey, where is Dan?

25:46.478 --> 25:47.889
- Here. Right here. Yes, ma'am.
- Dan? Okay.

25:47.980 --> 25:49.550
Why isn't Andrew on the team?

25:49.648 --> 25:50.820
He should be attached.

25:51.817 --> 25:54.388
That's an excellent point.
I wanted Andrew in the entourage,

25:54.486 --> 25:55.829
- but Amy said...
- AMY: Amy said nothing.

25:57.322 --> 25:58.323
So what up?

25:58.724 --> 26:00.328
You got it. Yes, ma'am. Sure.

26:00.392 --> 26:02.030
Guess "Operation Ray" failed, huh?

26:02.094 --> 26:04.096
Don't worry, I can write your statement.
"I resign."

26:04.196 --> 26:05.766
Or is that too wordy?

26:05.864 --> 26:08.242
This is really nice,
working together as a family.

26:08.333 --> 26:10.335
I actually enjoyed that gun show, you know?

26:10.402 --> 26:12.245
Once I got used to all the regular people

26:12.337 --> 26:13.941
and how fat they were, I really enjoyed it.

26:14.239 --> 26:17.015
- Obesity is a huge issue. Yeah?
- Yeah, it absolutely is. It is.

in Reflexology.
