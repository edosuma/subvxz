11:32.442 --> 11:34.023
It's okay.
It's okay, it's okay.

11:34.110 --> 11:35.270
It's okay.

11:35.403 --> 11:37.189
How many fingers
am I holding up?

11:37.280 --> 11:38.611
Are you okay?

11:40.783 --> 11:42.774
I know where Khlyen is.

11:45.121 --> 11:46.452
He ’3 in The Rack.

11:48.625 --> 11:52.163
Khlyen was in
a part of The Rack I'd
never even seen before.

11:52.295 --> 11:53.501
Level71.

11:55.256 --> 11:57.372
Is he their prisoner?
He had...

11:57.467 --> 12:00.925
He had an assistant,
an office. People practically
bowed when he passed.

12:01.346 --> 12:03.462
Khlyen is part
of The Rack, John.

12:03.806 --> 12:06.764
What if he was part of it
this whole time?

12:07.644 --> 12:09.475
What if I never
really escaped?

12:11.147 --> 12:13.103
Well, then, let's finally
set you free.

12:13.691 --> 12:15.306
No matter what it takes?

12:21.991 --> 12:23.652
I'll clear my schedule.

12:24.035 --> 12:25.195
(CHUCKLES)

12:25.828 --> 12:29.286
The bad news is The Rack
is in the most heavily
fortified station in the Quad.

12:29.374 --> 12:33.037
Yeah, but the good news is
our badges get us
in the front door.

12:37.173 --> 12:38.333
So, covert op?

12:39.634 --> 12:41.215
JOHN: Level 40 through 54.

12:41.344 --> 12:42.629
We get positioned
thereabouts, and then...

12:42.720 --> 12:44.836
Then I could shimmy through
these ventilation ducts.

12:44.973 --> 12:47.635
Exposing you
to enough radiation
to melt your face off.

12:47.725 --> 12:49.636
You're right.
You should do it.

12:50.728 --> 12:53.310
D'AVIN: (CLEARING THROAT)
Fresh soldiers?

12:54.524 --> 12:55.639
Thought you could
use them.

12:55.733 --> 12:57.473
You look intense.

12:58.194 --> 12:59.855
Those look intense.

12:59.988 --> 13:02.070
It's a Level 3 Leith job.
We've got this, D'Av.

13:02.198 --> 13:04.314
Right. None of my business.

13:04.409 --> 13:05.819
Sorry, force of habit.

13:05.910 --> 13:07.195
He could help, Johnny.

13:08.371 --> 13:09.986
He's great at tactical.

13:11.374 --> 13:14.332
Yeah, sure, I'm willing
to give it a shot.

13:23.511 --> 13:26.503
Bellus dug deep to get us
blueprints of The Rack.

13:26.597 --> 13:27.928
The Rack?

13:28.516 --> 13:31.633
What's the warrant?
No warrant.
But a long time coming.

13:31.728 --> 13:33.059
Khlyen.

13:33.521 --> 13:35.477
You found him?
Turns out he never left.

13:35.565 --> 13:37.851
We rerouted his
neuro-link to track him.

13:38.943 --> 13:43.437
He's stationed
at the top of HO.
He's in The Rack?

13:45.241 --> 13:47.482
Our Rack?
Floor 71.

13:47.577 --> 13:49.113
Upper levels
are officers only.

13:49.245 --> 13:51.531
Officers who work
interstellar.

13:51.622 --> 13:53.362
Setting up satellite offices
around the The "J"

13:53.458 --> 13:55.915
and introducing The Rack to
places that need order.

13:56.252 --> 13:58.163
When you confront Khlyen,
how are you going to...

13:58.254 --> 13:59.585
How are you
going to kill him?

14:02.091 --> 14:03.922
I'm not sure I can.

14:04.427 --> 14:06.213
But now? This is bigger
than killing.

14:06.304 --> 14:07.544
I need answers.

14:07.638 --> 14:10.425
What if he doesn't like
your questions? How are you
going to force an answer?

14:10.558 --> 14:11.968
Dutch, what's your
leverage?

14:12.435 --> 14:14.926
We hadn't gotten
to that part yet.

14:15.104 --> 14:17.971
I've had 20 years
to get to that part.

14:18.107 --> 14:19.563
I've got it.

14:20.610 --> 14:23.272
And a sudden craving
for something stronger
than beer.

14:32.288 --> 14:36.327
Johnny, that is a lot of
security doors on
automatic lockdown.

14:36.459 --> 14:38.871
You sure this is
going to work?
It has to.

14:38.961 --> 14:40.576
Dutch needs it.

14:40.963 --> 14:42.419
I need to orchestrate
a reason for us to get

14:42.507 --> 14:46.125
higher point-of-entry
privileges to The Rack
than usual.

14:50.264 --> 14:53.131
Well, um, good luck.

14:54.769 --> 14:55.849
(GLASSES CLINK)

14:58.106 --> 14:59.437
You, too.

15:05.863 --> 15:07.603
About your cause...

15:08.866 --> 15:09.981
Yes?

15:10.368 --> 15:12.233
I got one of my own.

15:12.328 --> 15:14.444
I figure we can
help each other out.

15:23.172 --> 15:25.163
KHLYEN: Do not eat that,
child.

15:28.970 --> 15:32.133
That smell, like almonds?

15:33.057 --> 15:36.470
It means the flesh
has fermented into
a deadly toxin.

15:36.561 --> 15:39.394
A single bite could
make you sick for days.

15:39.522 --> 15:42.104
YOUNG DUTCH: The other girls
keep taking my food.

15:42.191 --> 15:43.806
(EXHALES)

15:50.199 --> 15:53.362
You are Yalena,
of the family Yardeen.

15:54.245 --> 15:56.861
The others say
it's a shameful name.

15:59.667 --> 16:01.373
Yes, they are cruel to you.

16:02.545 --> 16:04.706
Perhaps you can change that.

16:04.839 --> 16:06.579
Restore Yardeeni honor.

16:06.883 --> 16:08.919
Your father is
counting on it.

16:09.427 --> 16:11.588
He sent me to find you,
little bird.

16:12.430 --> 16:14.921
To train you
and protect you.

16:17.101 --> 16:18.841
It won't be easy.

16:20.688 --> 16:23.179
And you have to
keep it a secret.

16:27.570 --> 16:30.232
No matter what hate
they spew at you.

16:31.032 --> 16:33.114
No matter what punishment.

16:33.576 --> 16:34.941
The truth is...

16:37.079 --> 16:38.740
You're special, Yala.

16:41.250 --> 16:42.410
Now...

16:43.794 --> 16:47.082
Do you know the story of
the Wasp and the Bear?

17:06.442 --> 17:07.852
JOHN: Are you okay?

17:07.944 --> 17:09.104
Yeah.

17:10.905 --> 17:14.318
I think I'm having
aftershocks from that
neuro-Iink.

17:14.450 --> 17:15.906
Visions? Nightmares?

17:18.246 --> 17:20.157
Just a memory about Khlyen.

17:21.916 --> 17:23.656
Nice one, actually.

17:25.127 --> 17:27.083
I didn't think
you had any of those.

17:29.632 --> 17:31.839
Guess I've only ever
told you the bad stuff.

17:31.968 --> 17:34.084
So, what's the good stuff?

17:36.639 --> 17:38.675
He's always protected me.

17:40.643 --> 17:45.763
There was a time when
he gave me hope when
I needed it the most.

17:47.942 --> 17:49.478
Better or worse,

17:51.028 --> 17:52.689
he's made me who I am.

17:55.116 --> 17:56.481
Bullshit.

17:57.451 --> 17:58.987
(SCOFFS)

17:59.829 --> 18:02.241
Six years ago,
I came in that door
for the first time

18:02.331 --> 18:04.492
to steal the prettiest ship
that I'd ever seen.

18:04.834 --> 18:07.496
And instead, I found
a half-feral beauty
in a wedding dress,

18:07.628 --> 18:09.835
covered in blood,
with a gun pointed
at my crotch.

18:10.381 --> 18:12.167
Um, your head,
if! recall.

18:12.300 --> 18:15.133
Well, you recall wrong.
My crotch remembers.

18:16.554 --> 18:19.921
But after all this time,
you're still more
your own person

18:20.016 --> 18:21.347
than anyone that I know.

18:21.851 --> 18:25.343
The only credit that Khlyen
gets is for the bruises
along the way.

18:28.190 --> 18:29.396
Thanks.

18:33.029 --> 18:35.566
I don't think
this is side effects.

18:37.241 --> 18:38.902
I think it's cold feet.

18:39.869 --> 18:43.361
I guess killing
your surrogate father
is no small thing.

18:45.916 --> 18:47.872
lfyou want to fight,
I got your back.

18:48.878 --> 18:51.494
lfyou want to run,
lcall shotgun.

18:53.549 --> 18:55.710
But you've got to
decide, Yalena.

18:58.721 --> 18:59.927
Say it one more time.

19:00.556 --> 19:01.716
What?

19:01.849 --> 19:04.386
What you told me
the night we first met.

19:10.107 --> 19:11.438
We don't have to stay here.

19:13.235 --> 19:17.069
We can just fly away
and never look back.

19:20.201 --> 19:21.737
Not this time.

19:23.746 --> 19:26.362
I'm going to face him,
Johnny. (CHUCKLES)

19:30.127 --> 19:31.412
I know.

19:35.383 --> 19:36.543
JOHN: Lucy?

19:37.760 --> 19:40.502
LUCY: Apologies, he still
has authorization.

19:40.596 --> 19:41.802
D'AVIN: Just me, Johnny.

19:41.931 --> 19:43.467
(SIGHS)

19:43.891 --> 19:45.176
I'm glad you're both up.

19:45.267 --> 19:47.758
Couldn't sleep.
D'AVIN: Yeah, me neither.

19:54.735 --> 19:56.817
I know how to get you
to the top of The Rack.

19:58.322 --> 19:59.778
D'AVIN: So, that's Arkyn.

19:59.907 --> 20:01.113
Looks like a good place
to hide out.

20:01.450 --> 20:03.190
I mean, ifthis
goes to hell.

20:03.285 --> 20:05.321
Itwon't, and it's not.

20:05.830 --> 20:09.948
That moon was The Company's
first foray into terraforming
before Westerley.

20:10.626 --> 20:11.832
Didn't do great.

20:11.961 --> 20:13.292
Rack central, 12:00.

20:13.421 --> 20:15.707
OFFICER: Call signs,
security clearance,

20:15.798 --> 20:16.913
reason for entry?

20:17.299 --> 20:20.291
Call sign U-gamma-4471-B.

20:21.679 --> 20:24.295
Level 3, 4 and 5
Reclamation Agents

20:24.432 --> 20:26.297
John Jaqobis,
D'avin Jaqobis and Dutch.

20:27.309 --> 20:29.015
Reason for entry?

20:30.187 --> 20:32.052
Guys, it's just
a formality, anyway.

20:32.148 --> 20:34.104
Hey.
Your reason for entry?

20:34.775 --> 20:35.935
(BEEPING)

20:36.026 --> 20:38.403
We've come to
file for divorce.

20:38.487 --> 20:40.318
To dissolve our team.

20:41.782 --> 20:44.194
You are clear for
clocking in bay 35.

20:44.326 --> 20:45.577
Welcome back, agents.

20:45.661 --> 20:47.492
That's not bad. I thought
we'd be down in the teens.

20:47.621 --> 20:50.863
Yeah, but Khlyen's on 71.
How you going to clear
40 levels?

20:51.000 --> 20:52.831
One floor at a time.

21:03.179 --> 21:07.639
COMPUTER:
Registered agent weapons
logged and approved.

21:12.354 --> 21:13.639
(BUZZING)

21:14.023 --> 21:15.229
That's new.

21:15.357 --> 21:16.858
Warning. Internal scan.

21:16.984 --> 21:19.726
Foreign object detected.
Oh, right, the surgery.

21:21.197 --> 21:22.983
Titanium stitches.

21:23.324 --> 21:25.531
And yeah, it really,
really hurt.

21:26.202 --> 21:27.533
Re-scan.

21:31.373 --> 21:33.364
Titanium traces detected.

21:33.501 --> 21:34.707
Approved.

21:42.718 --> 21:45.676
DUTCH: So, we're here to
terminate our affiliation
with D'avin Jaqobis.

21:45.763 --> 21:48.004
JOHN: We no longer intend
to Killjoy as a trio.

21:49.600 --> 21:50.680
OFFICIAL: Fine.

21:50.768 --> 21:52.679
I will remove
your sponsorship,
dissolve the team.

21:52.770 --> 21:54.385
So say you all?

21:55.439 --> 21:56.554
Aye.

21:57.024 --> 21:58.230
Aye.
Aye.

21:58.400 --> 22:00.265
TURIN: I have
some questions.

22:02.112 --> 22:03.977
Team Awesome Force
breaking up?

22:05.950 --> 22:07.156
It drags a bit
in the middle.

22:07.243 --> 22:09.234
I'll take it from here.

22:11.205 --> 22:13.947
Officer Turin, call sign
F-kilo-946-R,

22:14.083 --> 22:15.493
now recording
these proceedings.

22:15.584 --> 22:18.121
I have reason to suspect
the recent actions
of these agents.

22:18.546 --> 22:19.956
Well, I can think
of a reason. You're an...

22:20.089 --> 22:21.454
Let the record show,

22:21.715 --> 22:25.424
this is now an inquiry
into a possible suspension of
your reclamation licenses.

22:27.221 --> 22:28.802
Well, this is a good day.

22:31.642 --> 22:33.007
D'avin back yet?

22:33.102 --> 22:34.638
PREE: Still gone.

22:34.895 --> 22:36.601
As should you be.

22:37.106 --> 22:38.892
Hills has his men
combing the streets.

22:38.983 --> 22:40.848
They're rounding up monks.

22:40.943 --> 22:42.524
Over a few missing guns?

22:42.611 --> 22:44.147
Hills and l have
an agreement.

22:44.280 --> 22:46.566
Had an agreement.
Take the tunnels.

22:50.452 --> 22:51.441
Have faith.

22:52.663 --> 22:54.745
The roots will carry us.

22:55.165 --> 22:57.326
Why not file a split
with your broker?
Why come all this way?

22:57.459 --> 23:00.075
Well, we heard there was
a new chef in the caf, so...

23:00.170 --> 23:01.785
TURIN: You think
this is funny, son?

23:01.922 --> 23:03.662
D'AVIN: Actually,
I do think it's ajoke.

23:03.799 --> 23:05.835
lfyou had
anything incriminating
on these agents,

23:05.968 --> 23:10.086
you would have arrested them
the second they stepped
onto the station, sir.

23:10.180 --> 23:12.136
He's bossy. I like him.

23:12.433 --> 23:13.468
So, why don't you?

23:15.185 --> 23:16.971
It didn't work out.

23:18.105 --> 23:20.141
Did you sleep with him?
Hey.

23:21.317 --> 23:22.352
Yes.

23:22.985 --> 23:24.850
TURIN: (CHUCKLES) And that
made the jilted Jaqobis mad.

23:25.362 --> 23:26.522
You're such a piece
of work.

23:26.655 --> 23:28.771
I'm the one who screwed up.
I'm the one they're here
to report on.

23:28.866 --> 23:32.324
Do shut up, Bossy.
Because I beat her,
then stabbed him.

23:34.705 --> 23:36.320
TURIN: You attacked
your own team?

23:36.457 --> 23:38.823
The Rack takes assault
on its own very seriously.

23:38.959 --> 23:40.290
Then I want to speak
to a rep.

23:40.377 --> 23:43.244
But first, Iwant to
know that this
break-up is official.

23:43.339 --> 23:45.250
I want nothing to do
with these assholes.

23:45.341 --> 23:47.673
They ruined
my goddamn life.

23:49.011 --> 23:51.002
Like I said,
I knew I liked him.

23:56.060 --> 23:58.016
There. You're done
as a team.

23:59.188 --> 24:01.850
And when I'm done with you,
probably as a Killjoy.

24:02.691 --> 24:05.228
But I'll fetch your rep,
for appearances' sake.

24:05.361 --> 24:07.647
Try not to shiv anyone
while I'm gone.

24:10.991 --> 24:12.572
What the hell
are you doing?

24:12.701 --> 24:14.407
Come on. We don't have
much time.

24:14.536 --> 24:15.662
For what, D'av?

24:15.746 --> 24:17.202

36:36.695 --> 36:38.105
Just go.

36:38.196 --> 36:39.561
(BEEPING)

36:44.703 --> 36:46.068
What is she doing?

36:47.122 --> 36:49.955
You leave now,
there's no proof you were
involved in any of this.

36:50.041 --> 36:51.781
You can still be
a Killjoy.

36:51.876 --> 36:53.377
Hey, idiot.

36:53.461 --> 36:55.292
I only want to Killjoy
with you.

36:55.380 --> 36:56.870
Get to the Royale.
I'll make my own way home.

36:56.965 --> 36:59.126
Lucy, throttle down. Now!

36:59.259 --> 37:02.376
LUCY: I’m sorry, John,
Dutch has instituted
a master code.

37:05.473 --> 37:08.089
Initiate protocol.
Freebird.

37:08.893 --> 37:10.508
Initiating Freebird.

37:10.603 --> 37:11.854
No!

37:12.814 --> 37:14.304
Be safe.

37:25.702 --> 37:28.159
TURIN: I think your
free ride's just about up.

37:28.246 --> 37:30.362
Oh, give it up, Turin.
We both know...

37:31.291 --> 37:33.452
(GROANING)
Look at that.

37:34.669 --> 37:37.081
What the hell are you doing?
Are you crazy?

37:38.298 --> 37:41.711
You ever go
hunting for parson,
out in the badlands?

37:42.302 --> 37:43.917
Sneaky little things.

37:44.012 --> 37:45.923
But ifyou manage
to catch one,

37:46.014 --> 37:48.801
you break its wings,
throw it out onto the sands,

37:48.892 --> 37:51.679
and watch all his little
friends come running.

37:51.770 --> 37:54.011
I'm not bait,
I'm an agent.

37:54.105 --> 37:55.311
We're on the same side.

37:55.398 --> 37:56.558
See, that's just the thing.

37:56.649 --> 37:58.310
I'm not so sure we are.

38:00.612 --> 38:01.977
KHLYEN: We're not.

38:07.035 --> 38:08.525
DUTCH: Where am I?

38:08.995 --> 38:10.155
KH LYEN: Safe.

38:10.747 --> 38:14.160
Time to get you home,
and for me to fix your mess.

38:14.876 --> 38:16.036
DUTCH: John and D'avin?

38:16.878 --> 38:20.791
Will suffer
no repercussions for this
foolish infiltration.

38:21.174 --> 38:23.586
You'll need your full team
with what's coming.

38:27.388 --> 38:29.128
Keep that tourniquet tight.

38:29.224 --> 38:31.385
You've lost a lot of blood.

38:32.185 --> 38:34.517
DUTCH: Why do you
keep protecting me?

38:36.022 --> 38:37.603
(INHALING SHARPLY)

38:37.690 --> 38:39.396
(SHUSHING)

38:46.199 --> 38:48.611
Do you remember the first time
I tucked you in?

38:49.118 --> 38:50.528
I told you a story.

38:52.872 --> 38:54.703
The Wasp and the Bear.
Mmm-hmm.

38:54.791 --> 38:57.032
And the moral
of that story?

38:57.377 --> 39:01.120
In the end,
they save one another.

39:02.340 --> 39:04.126
I need you to live.

39:09.347 --> 39:11.133
Was any of it true?

39:12.725 --> 39:15.057
Did my father
really send you?

39:18.481 --> 39:20.062
What are you?

39:23.278 --> 39:24.859
I'm Level 6.

39:41.212 --> 39:42.827
I'm looking
for Alvis Akari.

39:44.632 --> 39:47.874
Resistance and disobedience
are punishable offenses

39:47.969 --> 39:49.630
under The Company directive,

39:49.721 --> 39:54.090
but you people don't seem
to be getting the message.

39:54.183 --> 39:55.844
Maybe the problem
isn't the message,

39:56.895 --> 39:58.977
but the method in which
it's being delivered.

40:00.189 --> 40:01.440
Alvis.

40:01.983 --> 40:03.814
I didn't think you'd
make it this easy.

40:03.902 --> 40:05.062
TO talk?

40:05.153 --> 40:06.518
We can always talk, Hills.

40:06.613 --> 40:08.979
About sadness, Joy...

40:09.741 --> 40:12.824
No amount of Joy is going to
get you out of this one.

40:12.911 --> 40:14.697
Alvis Akari, you are
under arrest...

40:14.787 --> 40:16.243
You really want to
light this match now, boots?

40:16.331 --> 40:18.413
...for orchestrating
the Leith Bazaar massacre.

40:18.499 --> 40:20.330
What massacre?
Hills, you know me.

40:20.418 --> 40:22.033
I don't know anything
anymore.

40:22.128 --> 40:24.164
Hills, don't be an idiot.
Shut him up.

40:24.255 --> 40:26.371
Even ifyou have to
remove his tongue to do it.

40:26.466 --> 40:27.706
Hills. (GROANING)

40:28.259 --> 40:29.920
(PEOPLE MURMURING)

40:30.011 --> 40:31.046
I don't know why.

40:37.518 --> 40:38.849
D'AVIN: What the hell
is going on out there?

40:38.937 --> 40:40.473
And where is Dutch?

40:40.563 --> 40:42.064
It's been four hours.

40:42.190 --> 40:44.852
And I can't decrypt
any of Khlyen's intel.

40:46.402 --> 40:48.188
I hope this was worth it.

40:48.279 --> 40:49.689
(DOOR CREAKING OPEN)

40:50.531 --> 40:51.737
Dutch.

40:52.533 --> 40:53.693
Holy hell.

40:54.369 --> 40:56.200
(PANTING AND GROANING)

41:02.251 --> 41:04.378
Pawter. We need Pawter.

41:08.883 --> 41:10.714
How much blood
have you lost?

41:11.052 --> 41:12.417
Khlyen is Level 6.

41:12.553 --> 41:13.679
What?

41:13.763 --> 41:15.128
He told me.

41:15.223 --> 41:18.556
Dutch, he's lying.
Level 6 Killjoys are a myth.

41:21.562 --> 41:23.598
DUTCH: So, why do
/ believe him?

41:25.316 --> 41:27.648
He's still messing
with your head.

41:27.735 --> 41:29.646
Look, Dutch, I know
a thing or two about
bad dads.

41:29.737 --> 41:31.318
And if I ever get a chance,

41:33.324 --> 41:36.111
lwill repay him
for everything that
he has done to you.

41:41.916 --> 41:45.408
How many breakups
do we need to go through
before you learn?

41:46.587 --> 41:48.794
I don't need you
to fight my battles.

41:49.257 --> 41:50.963
Doesn't mean
I don't want to.

41:51.676 --> 41:53.132
Then you better hurry.

41:53.803 --> 41:58.263
Whatever his plan is,
I think he'sjust
getting started.

41:59.684 --> 42:01.390
I know what you are.

42:01.477 --> 42:03.684
I know what you do up there.

42:03.771 --> 42:05.602
Really?
(G ROANS)

42:06.274 --> 42:08.265
Let's chat about that,
shall we?
