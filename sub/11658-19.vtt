00:56.166 --> 01:00.300
Gosh, wasn't that story
about the heart transplant amazing?

01:01.133 --> 01:02.367
Oh, I wasn't paying attention.

01:02.433 --> 01:05.100
I was fantasizing what Tom Brokaw
looks like naked.

01:07.867 --> 01:11.133
He must have sensed it. I thought I saw
him looking down your blouse.

01:13.066 --> 01:14.867
Hi, ma. Hi, Tony.

01:15.367 --> 01:18.367
Look, Dorothy, we won the dance contest
at the Sons of Italy bash.

01:18.433 --> 01:19.767
Oh, that's fantastic.

01:19.834 --> 01:22.900
I had no idea you were
such a good dancer.

01:22.967 --> 01:25.166
In the over-80 category
you don't have to be.

01:25.233 --> 01:27.967
We were the only couple who could do
the mambo without a walker.

01:29.200 --> 01:32.000
Don't believe her.
Your mother has some great moves.

01:32.066 --> 01:34.867
-I'll see you tomorrow, Sophia.
-Ok, Tony. Take care.

01:41.266 --> 01:42.700
Give me a break, would you?

01:46.533 --> 01:47.533
Bye.

01:48.266 --> 01:50.500
You really like Tony a lot,
don't you, Sophia?

01:50.567 --> 01:52.633
Why shouldn't I?
He's the best catch in town.

01:52.700 --> 01:54.433
He's got his own hair, his own teeth,

01:54.500 --> 01:56.700
and a totally unrestricted
driver's license.

01:58.567 --> 02:01.333
Hey, at my age,
it's like dating Tom Cruise.

02:04.333 --> 02:05.934
-Hi, everybody.
-Hi, Rose.

02:06.000 --> 02:07.567
-Hi...
-Rose?

02:10.400 --> 02:11.633
Yes, Dorothy?

02:11.700 --> 02:14.700
Is that a chicken you're carrying
in that cage?

02:14.767 --> 02:17.967
-Gee, I think it is. See you.
-Rose!

02:18.400 --> 02:20.066
-Before you all say no--
-No!

02:20.133 --> 02:22.934
-No!
-Oh, please, just hear me out.

02:23.266 --> 02:28.166
You've heard me speak about
Sylvia Beutel? It's her chicken.

02:28.233 --> 02:29.500
Sylvia Beutel?

02:29.767 --> 02:31.700
Isn't she the woman
who thought Milton Berle

02:31.767 --> 02:33.967
was sending her messages
through her dentures?

02:35.500 --> 02:38.433
Yes, but with extensive counseling
and some new bridgework,

02:38.500 --> 02:40.100
she's totally back to normal.

02:40.900 --> 02:43.667
Rose, the woman keeps
a chicken in her house.

02:43.734 --> 02:45.300
How normal can she be?

02:45.367 --> 02:48.467
-I kept a chicken in my home.
-You see my point?

02:50.633 --> 02:53.333
I will not have
that filthy beast in my house.

02:53.400 --> 02:57.066
-It belongs in a barnyard.
-This is not a farm chicken.

02:57.133 --> 02:59.767
Count Bessie's a show biz chicken.

02:59.834 --> 03:00.867
Wait till you see this.

03:01.367 --> 03:02.734
A show biz chicken.

03:02.800 --> 03:04.266
What does she do, play the piano?

03:05.600 --> 03:07.333
She plays the piano.

03:12.066 --> 03:14.100
You just wait till you see this.

03:14.166 --> 03:16.834
Ok, honey, come on.
It's show time.

03:16.900 --> 03:21.734
Come on, sweetheart.
Oh, I know. I know. Here we go.

03:21.800 --> 03:23.500
Ok, count, hit it!

03:30.500 --> 03:34.400
Isn't she incredible?
What do you say, girls, can she stay?

03:34.467 --> 03:37.333
-I guess so. All right.
-Thank you.

03:37.400 --> 03:42.567
-Be sure and keep her in her cage.
-Maybe I can convince the count

03:42.633 --> 03:45.166
to give us live entertainment
with dessert.

03:45.800 --> 03:47.000
Have you any requests?

03:47.567 --> 03:48.900
How about <i>Bye Bye, Birdie?</i>

03:52.567 --> 03:54.934
You know, I'm old.
Sometimes I get confused.

03:55.000 --> 03:57.300
I want to make sure I have this
absolutely right.

03:57.367 --> 03:59.300
Rose works in a place

03:59.367 --> 04:01.033
where they help people
with mental problems?

04:01.100 --> 04:02.100
That's right, ma.

04:02.166 --> 04:04.433
Anybody know how to get in touch
with Morley Safer?

04:05.166 --> 04:08.367
-(doorbell rings)
-I wonder who that could be?

04:08.433 --> 04:11.266
Maybe it's the count's clarinet player,
Henny Goodman.

04:14.500 --> 04:17.767
-Aunt Angela!
-No, Sophia Loren.

04:17.834 --> 04:19.867
I stopped using oil of Olay.

04:21.667 --> 04:23.667
-Angela!
-Sophia!

04:23.734 --> 04:24.734
Hello, there.

04:25.934 --> 04:27.633
-What's wrong?
-Nothing.

04:27.700 --> 04:30.367
You traveled 5,000 miles
from Sicily for nothing?

04:30.867 --> 04:31.867
I know what it is.

04:31.934 --> 04:33.900
The Balducci-Petrillo vendetta
is still on.

04:33.967 --> 04:37.734
Dorothy, buy a dozen mattresses,
30 pounds of pasta,

04:37.800 --> 04:41.500
-and aluminum foil for the windows.
-There is no vendetta.

04:41.567 --> 04:44.033
There's not even
a Balducci family anymore.

04:44.567 --> 04:46.934
They ate some sausages
that they shouldn't have

04:47.000 --> 04:49.400
at their last family picnic,
and they all died.

04:50.600 --> 04:51.600
Food poisoning.

04:51.667 --> 04:55.400
No, they stole the sausage
from the Calabrase family.

04:57.000 --> 04:58.333
So, what are you doing here?

04:58.734 --> 05:00.734
Well, I took a vacation
to come see you.

05:00.800 --> 05:04.100
-Didn't you get my letter?
-No, we never got a letter.

05:04.166 --> 05:07.533
-She never sent it. She forgets.
-I don't forget anything.

05:07.600 --> 05:09.400
-Hi, Angela.
-Hi, Blanche.

05:09.467 --> 05:11.734
-No, I'm Blanche.
-Doesn't that make it confusing,

05:11.800 --> 05:13.967
having two Blanches in the same house?

05:14.033 --> 05:16.633
Aunt Angela, wouldn't you like
to lie down?

05:16.700 --> 05:19.166
-You've had a long trip.
-I don't want to lie down.

05:19.233 --> 05:23.433
-I just got here.
-I always get tired after a long trip.

05:23.967 --> 05:26.734
I remember one time daddy took
the whole family

05:26.800 --> 05:30.800
across state on our tractor
to visit great-grandfather Zigbotten.

05:32.433 --> 05:35.100
Great-grandpa Ziggy
was a famous inventor.

05:35.166 --> 05:38.300
He developed the first and only
low-voltage meter

05:38.367 --> 05:41.367
that could detect what kind of a center
a piece of candy had.

05:45.166 --> 05:47.533
Anyway, we were just
a few miles out of town--

05:47.600 --> 05:49.367
You know, I am a little tired.

05:51.066 --> 05:53.333
-I think I will lie down.
-I'm tired, myself.

05:53.400 --> 05:54.934
-Me, too.
-I'm exhausted.

05:57.433 --> 05:59.700
Fine, but I'm warning
you all right now,

05:59.767 --> 06:02.567
I'm telling the rest of that story
as soon as you get up.

06:16.333 --> 06:18.967
Angela, that was the best meal
I've ever had in my life.

06:19.033 --> 06:21.200
Well, how good could it have been?
You left half of it.

06:21.266 --> 06:22.900
I ate every bite.

06:22.967 --> 06:25.266
Well, there's some sauce left.
If you really liked it,

06:25.333 --> 06:27.667
you'd take a hunk of that bread
and sop it all up.

06:27.734 --> 06:30.233
-You can afford it.
-Oh, no, I can't.

06:30.300 --> 06:32.567
I've put on a few pounds,
you just haven't noticed.

06:32.633 --> 06:33.934
What am I, blind?

06:35.633 --> 06:38.800
I can see that. I meant the bread.

06:38.867 --> 06:41.633
You can afford the bread.
It's only 89 cents a loaf.

06:42.166 --> 06:44.233
Angela, why don't you sit down?
I'll serve dessert.

06:44.300 --> 06:46.734
Gosh, you two made
such a fantastic meal,

06:46.800 --> 06:49.033
I can't imagine what
you came up with for dessert.

06:49.100 --> 06:50.834
-I made dessert.
-Damn.

06:54.934 --> 06:57.533
-What'd you say, Blanche?
-Yum. I said yum.

06:59.367 --> 07:00.567
Rose, is this another one

07:00.633 --> 07:03.734
of those Scandinavian
Viking concoctions?

07:03.800 --> 07:04.800
Yes.

07:05.934 --> 07:08.000
It's called genügenflürgen cake.

07:11.000 --> 07:14.433
It's an ancient recipe,
but I Americanized it.

07:14.500 --> 07:17.900
Yeah. So one might say you brought
geflürgennügen into the eighties?

07:19.433 --> 07:23.367
Yes, but I'm not one
to blow my own vertubenfluggen.

07:26.266 --> 07:27.800
I can't even reach mine.

07:34.100 --> 07:38.567
So, Sophia, have you all had a chance
to catch up on old times?

07:38.633 --> 07:42.567
Yeah. Angela filled me in
on how everyone is doing.

07:42.633 --> 07:44.767
-How is everybody, Angela?
-Dead.

07:47.066 --> 07:49.934
Angela and I are the only two
left of the original family.

07:50.000 --> 07:51.400
That's terrible, Angela.

07:51.467 --> 07:53.266
Does that mean you're all alone
back in Sicily?

07:53.333 --> 07:54.800
No, I have a goat.

07:55.967 --> 07:57.734
Actually, I lead a very full life.

07:57.800 --> 08:00.300
I get up in the morning,
I milk the goat...

08:00.367 --> 08:02.934
go to a funeral, come back,
feed the goat...

08:04.066 --> 08:06.900
then I drink Chianti and pass out.

08:08.300 --> 08:11.834
It's really a shame you and ma
don't live closer to each other.

08:12.300 --> 08:15.033
Dorothy's right.
How many years do we have left?

08:15.300 --> 08:16.367
20, 30...

08:17.734 --> 08:19.133
we should live in the same town.

08:19.200 --> 08:21.633
You want come back to that
little village in Sicily?

08:21.700 --> 08:24.433
Please. Do I look like a woman
who beats her laundry on a rock?

08:25.834 --> 08:27.667
I meant you should move here.

08:27.734 --> 08:30.233
Oh, that's a great idea.
Angela, you'd love Miami.

08:30.300 --> 08:31.700
Aunt Angela, what do you say?

08:31.767 --> 08:36.100
Oh, I don't know. I'm too old to pick up
and move to a strange country.

08:36.500 --> 08:39.767
Before your husband died,
you lived here 30 years.

08:41.000 --> 08:43.800
-I don't know.
-Come on. Think about it.

08:43.867 --> 08:47.100
Who would you rather live with,
your sister or a goat?

08:47.166 --> 08:48.400
Give me a minute.

08:51.867 --> 08:55.233
-All right. I'll do it.
-Wonderful!

08:55.300 --> 08:57.300
While you pack in Sicily,

08:57.367 --> 08:59.066
we'll be looking for
a place for you to live.

08:59.133 --> 09:01.600
Why should she have
to make two trips?

09:01.667 --> 09:05.066
We can send for her things and she can
stay here until we find her a place.

09:05.133 --> 09:07.800
Well, that sounds wonderful...
if nobody minds.

09:07.867 --> 09:10.533
Mind? Why should we mind?

09:11.767 --> 09:14.133
Dorothy, could I see you a moment?

09:20.667 --> 09:22.867
-Are you out of your mind?
-What?

09:22.934 --> 09:25.266
What business did you have,
inviting my sister?

09:25.333 --> 09:29.033
Ma, what are you talking about?
You're the one who invited her.

09:29.100 --> 09:31.700
Yeah, Miami, the city.
Not Miami, my house.

09:32.333 --> 09:35.300
-Am I missing something?
-You don't know Angela like I do.

09:35.367 --> 09:38.000
All my life, she always
wanted whatever I had.

09:38.066 --> 09:39.266
Even if she didn't want it.

09:39.533 --> 09:42.467
She'll live here awhile, see how nice
I have it, and she'll try to muscle in.

09:42.533 --> 09:45.000
Oh, come on, ma.
I think you're overreacting.

09:45.633 --> 09:46.700
Aunt Angela, where you going?

09:46.767 --> 09:48.967
I'm gonna tape my name
on the mailbox.

09:49.300 --> 09:51.100
After all, I live here now.

09:52.800 --> 09:55.934
Any more bright ideas,
linguini-for-brains?

10:07.100 --> 10:09.300
-Hi, Rose, what you got there?
-Just a little snack.

10:09.367 --> 10:11.066
Oh, darn. I forgot something.

10:18.233 --> 10:22.100
-Mmm, not bad. What is it?
-I'm not sure.

10:22.166 --> 10:24.433
The pet store calls it "chicken chow."

10:32.333 --> 10:36.667
-Maledizione! Maledizione!
-Oh, ma. What's wrong now?

10:36.734 --> 10:40.567
Living with Angela has been a nightmare.
I don't think she's ever gonna leave.

10:40.633 --> 10:44.834
-What's she done now?
-She used up all my porcelana.

10:45.133 --> 10:46.767
Look at all these liver spots.

10:47.400 --> 10:49.567
I got more brown skin
than the temptations.

10:50.500 --> 10:52.400
Ma, I'll get you another bottle.

10:52.467 --> 10:55.333
I wish you would at least try
to get along with her.

10:55.400 --> 10:57.000
I have tried to get along.

10:57.066 --> 10:58.967
Did I complain when I had to
share my bed with her?

10:59.033 --> 11:01.467
-Yes.
-And when she used my poly-grip

11:01.533 --> 11:03.734
-to fix the heel on her shoe?
-Yes.

11:03.800 --> 11:05.467
Did I complain
when she ruined your sweater

11:05.533 --> 11:09.300
-when she washed in the ditch out back?
-She ruined my sweater?

11:09.867 --> 11:11.800
Oh, maybe I shouldn't have said anything.

11:12.333 --> 11:16.934
Ma, she won't be here that much longer.
I wish you'd try to be patient.

11:17.000 --> 11:19.867
She's out with Blanche right now,
looking at another place.

11:19.934 --> 11:22.734
And how many places has she seen lately?

11:22.800 --> 11:26.800
Every place is too small,
not enough light, no room for a goat...

11:28.233 --> 11:29.367
she'll be here forever.

11:29.433 --> 11:32.633
It's just like I told you,
whatever I have, she wants.

11:34.233 --> 11:37.233
-Hi, aunt Angela, how was the apartment?
-She liked it very much.

11:37.300 --> 11:41.266
-What's not to like?
-Lovely people, close to the beach,

11:41.333 --> 11:43.867
-and within my price range.
-Are you taking it?

11:43.934 --> 11:47.867
Well, it's kinda small
and not enough light...

11:47.934 --> 11:50.200
-And there's no room for a goat.
-...there's no room for a goat.

11:51.533 --> 11:54.700
Come into the kitchen. I made dinner.
Should be ready.

11:54.767 --> 11:56.166
I was gonna cook dinner.

11:56.233 --> 11:57.233
Well, I thought for a change

11:57.300 --> 11:59.567
everyone would like to have a meal
with a little flavor.

12:01.100 --> 12:02.633
I'm supposed to get along with that?

12:03.300 --> 12:04.767
Ooh, that smells great.

12:04.834 --> 12:07.300
She probably defrosted
something I already cooked.

12:07.700 --> 12:08.867
Yeah, I did...

12:09.367 --> 12:10.834
but I had to throw it out.

12:11.967 --> 12:13.900
It smelled like it had gone bad.

12:14.567 --> 12:17.533
It was probably no good
to begin with you cooked it.

12:17.600 --> 12:18.767
That does it!

12:20.266 --> 12:22.734
Ma got something
caught in her throat.

12:22.800 --> 12:23.834
There.

12:25.433 --> 12:27.033
That should take care of it.

12:27.800 --> 12:29.567
We're all out of fresh pepper.
Do you have any more?

12:29.633 --> 12:31.400
In the pantry. In the back.

12:31.467 --> 12:34.133
Oh, boy. This chicken looks great.

12:34.734 --> 12:37.533
Girls, count Bessie is missing!

12:40.233 --> 12:43.600
I went to feed her,
and her cage was empty.

12:43.667 --> 12:44.800
Where could she be?

13:02.900 --> 13:04.567
Uh, aunt Angela?

13:07.400 --> 13:10.734
-Where did you get this chicken?
-The garage.

13:13.433 --> 13:16.900
I guess this means no live entertainment
with dessert.

13:28.667 --> 13:31.900
-(playing "Mary Had a Little Lamb")
-Rose...

13:32.266 --> 13:34.867
honey, you've got to stop
torturing yourself like this.

13:34.934 --> 13:37.834
-Count Bessie is gone.
-I know.

13:38.333 --> 13:40.066
It's just such a tragedy.

13:40.500 --> 13:43.133
Who cooks a musician
at the height of her career?

13:46.600 --> 13:48.467
Rose, you've got to put this
in perspective.

13:48.533 --> 13:50.133
Count Bessie was a chicken.

13:50.200 --> 13:53.367
It's not like Angela
fried up Doc Severinson.

13:56.000 --> 13:58.367
-How you doing, Rose?
-Not very good, Dorothy.

13:58.433 --> 14:02.867
You don't think so,
but in a few days, you'll feel better.

14:02.934 --> 14:04.266
No, I won't.

14:04.567 --> 14:07.734
Mrs. Beutel will be back then.
What will I say?

14:08.333 --> 14:12.767
Welcome home. How was your trip?
By the way, here's count Bessie.

14:15.800 --> 14:19.467
Rose, honey! Think of the positive things.

14:19.533 --> 14:23.533
Count Bessie accomplished more
in a few years on this earth than...

14:23.967 --> 14:26.433
than most chickens do in a lifetime.

14:27.500 --> 14:30.266
Give me a break.
I'm making this up as I go along.

14:31.967 --> 14:36.233
Above all else, that chicken was
a great entertainer,

14:36.300 --> 14:41.133
and a great entertainer deserves
to be remembered in a special way.

14:41.800 --> 14:42.800
Yeah.

14:43.433 --> 14:45.767
Like with a roast at the friars club.

14:59.967 --> 15:02.734
-I was only kidding.
-It was just a joke.

15:02.800 --> 15:04.800
A darn good one, too.

15:06.667 --> 15:09.533
-Rose, what you got there?
-Exhibit "a."

15:11.633 --> 15:12.800
You know, I like Rose,

15:12.867 --> 15:16.600
but when a woman screams "murderer"
over a platter of chicken...

15:17.200 --> 15:19.500
she's missing some bocce balls.

15:20.700 --> 15:23.934
-I'm getting out of here just in time.
-You found an apartment?

15:24.000 --> 15:28.500
Yeah. The senior citizens center
has an early bird special,

15:28.567 --> 15:32.166
decaf coffee, sodium-free bacon,
and a chest X-ray.

15:32.800 --> 15:36.000
On the bulletin board,
I saw advertisements for roommates.

15:36.066 --> 15:40.700
-I picked a few and found one I liked.
-Isn't that wonderful?

15:40.767 --> 15:44.367
My new roommate's coming
to help move my stuff.

15:44.834 --> 15:45.834
Thief!

15:46.233 --> 15:48.767
-What?
-What's that on your neck?

15:48.834 --> 15:49.834
A wart.

15:50.767 --> 15:54.767
My necklace from mommy for confirmation.
You always wanted that!

15:54.834 --> 15:56.633
-I didn't!
-Why'd you take it?

15:56.700 --> 15:58.000
To cover the wart.

15:59.266 --> 16:02.100
-Give me back my necklace.
-Oh, come on, ma.

16:02.166 --> 16:04.967
No. No come on. Here! Forget it!

16:05.033 --> 16:08.834
Ever since I got here, your mother's
accused me of stealing everything of hers

16:08.900 --> 16:11.934
that wasn't nailed down.
I'm glad I'm moving!

16:12.000 --> 16:14.934
-Moving?
-Angela found herself an apartment.

16:15.200 --> 16:18.066
I know you hate me,
so don't bother visiting.

16:18.133 --> 16:22.233
Come on, you two.
Ma, she is your only sister.

16:23.266 --> 16:24.300
Ok.

16:24.367 --> 16:26.633
All we've done is fight
the last three weeks.

16:26.900 --> 16:28.467
What do you say we call a truce?

16:29.000 --> 16:33.100
-Ok. A truce.
-(doorbell rings)

16:34.300 --> 16:35.300
Oh, hi.

16:35.767 --> 16:37.033
-Hi, Tony.
-Hi, Tony.

16:37.100 --> 16:40.066
-You know him?
-Know him? He's my boyfriend.

16:40.133 --> 16:41.500
That's my new roommate.

16:43.900 --> 16:48.333
I thought this address sounded familiar.
Boy, this is some coincidence.

16:48.400 --> 16:50.400
This is no coincidence!

16:50.467 --> 16:53.266
Everything I have you try to steal.

16:53.767 --> 16:57.200
May the bags under your eyes grow
so large, your head falls in them!

16:59.166 --> 17:01.900
May your shampoo
get mixed up with your preparation "h"

17:01.967 --> 17:04.266
and shrink your head
to the size of a mushroom!

17:04.867 --> 17:06.400
Tony, grab the bags!

17:16.333 --> 17:19.033
Come on, honey.
Just try it. It doesn't hurt.

17:19.433 --> 17:20.567
See?

17:32.834 --> 17:35.300
-Hi, Dorothy.
-Hi, Rose.

17:38.400 --> 17:41.800
Rose, do you know off-hand if 9-1-1

17:41.867 --> 17:44.133
is the right number to call
for a straight jacket?

17:46.800 --> 17:50.433
-Dorothy, I can explain.
-I know you can, that's the scary part.

17:50.500 --> 17:54.033
You don't understand.
When Mrs. Beutel finds out about Bessie,

17:54.100 --> 17:58.066
she'll be devastated.
There'll be a terrible void in her life.

17:58.133 --> 18:00.967
A void only another
musical chicken can fill.

18:01.033 --> 18:03.033
Look, Rose,
if you're worried about voids,

18:03.100 --> 18:04.734
start with the one in your head.

18:06.100 --> 18:08.100
Come on, honey, just a few notes?

18:08.567 --> 18:10.734
Oh, Dorothy, do you believe it?

18:10.800 --> 18:14.767
I mean, four chickens, and not one of them
has any musical ability.

18:15.800 --> 18:17.533
It's a sad commentary, Rose.

18:18.100 --> 18:21.734
All the young chickens are wasting their
time playing video games.

18:24.400 --> 18:27.633
-Oh, hi. Can I make y'all some lunch?
-What is it?

18:27.700 --> 18:29.800
-Fruit salad.
-I'll get Sophia.

18:29.867 --> 18:33.467
She has no appetite
since she was stabbed in the back.

18:33.533 --> 18:35.800
Oh, my god!
Who stabbed Sophia?

18:36.567 --> 18:38.600
The chef at Benihana.

18:40.700 --> 18:45.233
Angela. Ma thinks
that Angela tried to steal her boyfriend.

18:45.300 --> 18:46.734
-And you don't?
-Of course not.

18:46.800 --> 18:50.300
Don't be so sure.
Angela and Sophia are sisters.

18:50.600 --> 18:53.233
Sisters have a natural adversarial
relationship.

18:53.300 --> 18:54.867
That's 'cause it's genetic.

18:55.367 --> 18:58.533
It involves the double helix
of the DNA molecule.

18:59.900 --> 19:00.900
What?

19:01.700 --> 19:03.333
It's true. It was on television.

19:03.400 --> 19:07.066
Peter Marshall played
this microbiologist on <i>The Love Boat.</i>

19:07.133 --> 19:11.033
He was conducting sinister experiments on
the Landers sisters.

19:12.600 --> 19:14.133
My apologies, Rose.

19:14.200 --> 19:17.467
For a moment there,
I didn't think it was documented.

19:18.700 --> 19:21.300
You know, what is happening
between them

19:21.367 --> 19:26.233
is not unlike and incident which occurred
between my sister Virginia and me.

19:26.734 --> 19:31.100
Can you believe that one's sister
could seduce her sibling's boyfriend

19:31.166 --> 19:33.734
on the eve of that sibling's senior prom?

19:33.800 --> 19:37.000
-Virginia did that?
-No. I did that to Virginia.

19:39.066 --> 19:40.133
She deserved it.

19:40.200 --> 19:42.467
She borrowed my saddle shoes
without asking.

19:44.934 --> 19:48.400
She scuffed those shoes.
I hardly left a mark on that boy.

19:52.400 --> 19:54.834
-I'm going to Tony's.
-For lunch?

19:54.900 --> 19:58.934
I just called him. He was in bed.
I heard laughter in the background.

19:59.000 --> 20:00.200
It was Angela.

20:00.567 --> 20:02.734
They're sleeping together,
like I suspected.

20:02.800 --> 20:04.133
I'm going there to kill her.

20:04.633 --> 20:06.533
I'll be back for <i>Wheel of Fortune.</i>

20:14.834 --> 20:15.967
(knock on door)

20:16.033 --> 20:17.934
Open up, tramp!
I know you're in there.

20:18.000 --> 20:19.066
Who is it?

20:19.333 --> 20:22.967
-You can run, but not hide.
-I can barely walk.

20:23.266 --> 20:24.700
Fine. Rub it in.

20:25.367 --> 20:26.834
What are you talking about?

20:31.500 --> 20:33.767
You and Tony, fooling around.

20:33.834 --> 20:36.500
That's a lie.
I've been shopping all day.

20:36.567 --> 20:40.700
-In your bathrobe?
-I came home, I showered. Kill me.

20:40.767 --> 20:42.333
Why do you think I'm here?

20:42.867 --> 20:45.900
How? By forcing me to eat your baked ziti?

20:47.133 --> 20:48.900
-Take that back.
-I will not!

20:48.967 --> 20:53.700
May your lip hairs grow backwards
and tangle with your nose hairs!

20:55.734 --> 20:59.367
May you take a diuretic and be unable
to remove your panty hose.

21:00.567 --> 21:04.834
-Hey, hey, hey! What's going on here?
-Taking a shower, huh?

21:04.900 --> 21:09.233
-I suppose this is your luffa sponge?
-What are you talking about?

21:09.300 --> 21:12.467
You toyed with my emotions,
with my affection,

21:12.533 --> 21:16.333
-and worse, with my sister.
-That's not true, Sophia.

21:16.400 --> 21:18.100
Angela's just my roommate.

21:18.667 --> 21:20.600
You're the only woman in my life.

21:20.967 --> 21:23.433
There can be no one else but you, dear.

21:24.333 --> 21:27.066
Oh... Tony.

21:29.233 --> 21:31.433
Oh... Angela.

21:33.767 --> 21:36.233
Oh, boy. Who is that woman?

21:37.800 --> 21:41.233
W-what... oh! This woman!
She's my cleaning lady.

21:41.300 --> 21:42.767
-What?
-You said I was

21:42.834 --> 21:44.567
the only woman in your life!

21:45.500 --> 21:48.000
You've insulted my sister's honor!

21:48.066 --> 21:51.400
-I don't know what to say.
-I tell you, say "ouch"!

21:51.700 --> 21:54.433
-Say "that hurts"!
-Say "stop hitting me"!

21:54.500 --> 21:56.367
-Right! Say it again!
-Say it again!

22:01.367 --> 22:04.400
So the two of you
just started hitting him?

22:04.467 --> 22:07.433
-He was cheating on me.
-He got off easy.

22:07.500 --> 22:11.567
In Sicily, with uncle Bruno,
he'd have been in hot water.

22:11.633 --> 22:15.600
-What would Bruno have done?
-You're deaf? She told you.

22:15.667 --> 22:17.266
He would have put him in hot water.

22:19.000 --> 22:22.100
At least something good resulted.
You're close again.

22:22.166 --> 22:25.500
Yeah, right now,
but we'll be fighting again.

22:25.567 --> 22:28.934
That doesn't mean we don't love each
other. It's just our relationship.

22:29.300 --> 22:31.333
-It comes from our mother.
-Our father.

22:31.667 --> 22:33.000
-Mother.
-Father!

22:33.066 --> 22:34.567
-Shut up!
-You!

22:34.834 --> 22:36.600
-May your nose--
-Ma.

22:38.934 --> 22:41.800
You're right, you're right.
We get it from our father.

22:44.867 --> 22:48.100
Hey, now, Angela, there's something
I want to give you.

22:49.066 --> 22:50.066
Here.

22:50.400 --> 22:51.967
Mama gave you that.

22:52.400 --> 22:54.000
I know. I want you to have it.

22:55.200 --> 22:57.433
It's my way of apologizing
for my behavior.

22:57.500 --> 23:01.400
Sophia, this is the nicest
thing anybody ever gave me.

23:01.467 --> 23:04.667
Don't get choked up.
I only gave it to you to hide that wart.

23:06.533 --> 23:10.133
(chimes play "Old MacDonald")

23:10.200 --> 23:12.834
Oh, my God. It can't be!

23:15.000 --> 23:18.066
-It is!
-Count Bessie!

23:18.934 --> 23:21.567
Angela, that chicken you
cooked the other night,

23:21.633 --> 23:24.233
-didn't you get it from the garage?
-That's right.

23:24.300 --> 23:27.033
-Out of the cage?
-No. Out of the freezer.

23:27.567 --> 23:31.333
You think I'd kill a live chicken?
What do I look like, Conan the barbarian?

23:33.066 --> 23:36.967
I must have left the cage open,
and she wandered away.

23:37.033 --> 23:39.900
I got to leave and
get another apartment.

23:39.967 --> 23:44.467
Until you find a place
you'll stay right here with us.

23:44.533 --> 23:47.500
-Dorothy, can I see you for a moment?
-Dorothy, can I see you for a moment?

23:58.700 --> 24:04.567
(theme music playing)
