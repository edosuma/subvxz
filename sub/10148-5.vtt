WEBVTT

01:10.529 --> 01:11.906
Hold the doors!

01:14.992 --> 01:17.161
Thanks, I thought I was gonna miss...

01:17.620 --> 01:19.789
my train.

01:21.082 --> 01:23.876
Hey, Terminal, the guy
says we're in his train.

01:27.171 --> 01:29.757
You really should
label the things you own.

01:29.840 --> 01:30.840
I do.

01:42.520 --> 01:45.398
I really don't think
you should be doing this.

01:46.315 --> 01:48.150
Please stop!

01:48.234 --> 01:49.694
Please, I beg you!

01:50.528 --> 01:51.904
What do you say, crew?

01:51.988 --> 01:53.948
Since he asked so nicely.

02:07.795 --> 02:11.007
You're not laughing. He's not laughing.

02:11.090 --> 02:14.427
Maybe we should share a few smiles
just to encourage him.

02:23.185 --> 02:27.148
Well, crew, we've brightened
the life ofjust one more bored citizen.

02:27.231 --> 02:28.899
Our work here is done.

02:44.790 --> 02:46.000
Keep smiling.

03:33.881 --> 03:34.881
Slag it!

03:50.356 --> 03:51.357
Jokerz!

03:59.824 --> 04:02.743
- So, Terminal. where to next?
- Later.

04:02.827 --> 04:04.203
I'm crashing.

04:04.286 --> 04:07.415
What's the matter, fearless leader?
Need your beauty sleep?

04:19.385 --> 04:21.095
Don't make fun of me.

04:22.221 --> 04:23.097
Mmm-hmm.

04:23.180 --> 04:24.180
Good.

04:41.782 --> 04:43.242
Uh-oh. The GAT scores are in.

04:43.826 --> 04:45.619
I don't even wanna know what I got.

04:49.373 --> 04:50.875
Hey, Max, what's your ID?

04:50.958 --> 04:53.085
The last prime number
before my birth year.

04:58.340 --> 05:00.968
Twenty-four hundred!
You got a perfect score!

05:01.051 --> 05:04.638
Yeah, well, it's just a number.
It doesn't mean anything.

05:04.722 --> 05:06.932
Believe me, Terry,
you're just as smart as I am.

05:07.016 --> 05:08.684
Think so, huh?

05:08.851 --> 05:09.851
Let's see what he got.

05:13.230 --> 05:14.732
Incomplete?

05:14.815 --> 05:17.234
How do you get an incomplete
on the GATs?

05:17.318 --> 05:19.570
Some emergency. I had to leave
before the test was over.

05:20.196 --> 05:23.699
Sometimes I get the feeling you
arrange for these emergencies.

05:26.577 --> 05:29.038
Near perfect score, Carter. Way to go!

05:29.121 --> 05:32.041
Yeah, well, class president
has to set an example.

05:32.124 --> 05:34.919
With scores like that,
you're a shoo-in for valedictorian.

05:35.544 --> 05:36.879
Yeah, a shoo-in.

05:36.962 --> 05:39.048
So what if you didn't get top score?

05:39.131 --> 05:40.131
What?

05:45.638 --> 05:48.891
Hey, Max, congrats on the top score!

05:48.974 --> 05:51.268
No big whoop. It's just a test.

05:51.560 --> 05:53.938
Oh, don't be so modest, Max.

05:54.021 --> 05:56.649
Judging by your GATs,
I'd say you could give Carter here

05:56.732 --> 05:58.275
a run for valedictorian if you wanted.

06:07.243 --> 06:08.327
What's that?

06:08.410 --> 06:10.663
The results of a compiler program
I've written.

06:10.746 --> 06:12.164
About Batman?

06:12.831 --> 06:15.876
Yeah, I needed a hobby,
and it beats macrame.

06:17.127 --> 06:20.130
I hacked my ID so that I can
stay after hours to work on it.

06:20.631 --> 06:23.634
The program searches the grid for
specific information about Batman.

06:24.093 --> 06:29.223
"He's between 5'6" and 6 feet,
between 16 and 36."

06:29.890 --> 06:32.393
How can he be that young,
if he's been around for so long?

06:32.643 --> 06:35.604
I figure the guy that's been around
lately is a brand-new bat.

06:37.064 --> 06:39.066
A lot of people
would fit this description.

06:39.149 --> 06:41.443
Maybe, but every day,
another bit of data

06:41.527 --> 06:42.903
helps narrow it down.

06:42.987 --> 06:44.655
Eventually, I'll have the guy pegged.

06:44.738 --> 06:45.823
If it is a guy.

06:45.906 --> 06:48.534
He's a guy,
and he's connected to our school.

06:48.617 --> 06:49.618
I'm sure of it.

06:50.244 --> 06:51.662
He's, like, a teacher?

06:51.745 --> 06:55.499
A teacher or a phys-ed coach
or even a student.

07:08.429 --> 07:11.515
How could you have done
so poorly on the GATs?

07:11.640 --> 07:13.475
I got an almost perfect score.

07:13.559 --> 07:16.520
"Almost" doesn't get
you ahead in life, dearest.

07:16.895 --> 07:19.523
"Almost" gets you almost.

07:19.607 --> 07:21.358
Only one student got higher.

07:21.442 --> 07:24.236
Well, that would make you
the winning loser, wouldn't it?

07:24.320 --> 07:26.530
And if that's good enough
for you then I can see

07:26.614 --> 07:28.532
why my opinion doesn't
mean much to you, either.

07:51.889 --> 07:53.932
Vidphone, speed dial six.

07:54.016 --> 07:56.185
Yo.

07:56.268 --> 07:59.021
I have a little business
to take care of tonight.

07:59.104 --> 08:01.649
After hours at Hill High.

08:01.732 --> 08:03.484
<i>Don't worry, we'll be there...</i>

08:06.570 --> 08:07.570
<i>Terminal.</i>

08:25.297 --> 08:26.632
So much for the GAT scores.

08:30.552 --> 08:32.513
Can we go home now?

08:32.596 --> 08:34.848
I haven't been in school
since sixth grade.

08:35.015 --> 08:36.392
It creeps me out.

08:36.475 --> 08:38.268
Just one more bit of electro-vandalism.

08:53.075 --> 08:55.285
Little Ms. Perfect Score.

08:55.369 --> 08:56.578
Let's see what else...

08:56.662 --> 08:58.080
Valedictorian?

09:01.291 --> 09:02.918
Oh, I don't think so.

09:06.130 --> 09:07.506
It blipped you.

09:07.589 --> 09:09.258
There's more than one way to interface.

09:14.596 --> 09:16.515
I hear they jolted
all the vidscreens.

09:16.598 --> 09:17.766
Jokerz.

09:17.850 --> 09:20.018
Stupid, random destruction.

09:20.102 --> 09:22.187
Not so random. Look at the damage.

09:22.271 --> 09:23.939
They were picking their targets.

09:25.649 --> 09:27.651
You're saying
they're students here?

09:27.735 --> 09:28.944
At least one of them is.

09:29.027 --> 09:31.488
Maybe I could rewrite
my Batman search program

09:31.572 --> 09:33.699
to look for the students
most likely to be Jokerz.

09:34.616 --> 09:36.243
So you'd stop looking for Batman?

09:36.744 --> 09:38.162
Are you sure you wanna do that?

09:43.959 --> 09:45.085
I am now.

09:57.473 --> 09:59.516
<i>May I see your passes,
please, kids?</i>

09:59.600 --> 10:01.852
Look who's playing hall monitor!

10:03.353 --> 10:04.980
Care to explain what you're doing here?

10:05.063 --> 10:07.065
Actually, no.

11:15.759 --> 11:16.969
What are you doing with this?

11:18.053 --> 11:20.180
I use it to scrape bugs
off my windshield.

11:20.264 --> 11:22.307
Guess it isn't working.
You're still here.

11:22.516 --> 11:24.685
You've been breaking
into school lockers.

11:24.768 --> 11:27.104
- Why?
- Just her locker.

11:27.187 --> 11:28.981
To send a message. She's a threat.

11:29.606 --> 11:31.984
Because she can finger you clowns
beneath your greasepaint?

11:32.067 --> 11:34.653
Don't know nothing about that.
I just do what I'm told.

11:35.237 --> 11:38.532
Tell your boss to back off.
I'll get Max off his tail.

11:39.032 --> 11:40.868
You think you can relay
that message for me?

11:42.619 --> 11:45.330
Yeah, but you might have to give
us a tow back to the school.

11:45.414 --> 11:46.790
That's where we left him.

11:59.887 --> 12:01.972
Hello? Anybody there?

12:14.026 --> 12:18.196
<i>Query, how many custodians
does it take to clean a school?</i>

12:19.072 --> 12:21.450
<i>Answer, none, twip.</i>

12:21.533 --> 12:23.160
<i>It's all done by machines.</i>

12:24.077 --> 12:27.539
<i>Just a squirt of oil and a recharge
and they keep the place spotless.</i>

12:27.623 --> 12:31.126
<i>And cleanliness is so important,
don't you think?</i>

12:31.209 --> 12:33.420
<i>That's why I've replaced
the standard cleaning fluid</i>

12:33.503 --> 12:35.213
<i>with something a little stronger.</i>

12:38.133 --> 12:39.384
<i>Acid!</i>

12:56.151 --> 12:57.361
Batman, wait!

13:06.036 --> 13:09.122
Max! Are you all right?
Uh, the hallway's a mess of goo!

13:09.665 --> 13:13.168
Yeah, I must have accidentally
tripped some kind of Joker trap.

13:13.543 --> 13:15.128
It was no accident.

13:15.212 --> 13:17.172
This trap wasn't meant for just anyone.

13:17.255 --> 13:18.882
The Jokerz are after you.

13:19.049 --> 13:21.218
What? Why?

13:21.677 --> 13:23.655
Your search program, Max.
You've gotta shut it down.

13:23.679 --> 13:24.680
For your own safety!

13:28.016 --> 13:30.560
Please, just trust me on this one, okay?

13:33.188 --> 13:34.188
Okay.

13:34.690 --> 13:37.010
I'm gonna go make sure there's
no one else in the building.

13:41.780 --> 13:44.282
Drag program "Max Joker 1"
to trash and empty.

13:45.409 --> 13:46.994
<i>Transferring program.</i>

13:47.536 --> 13:49.788
<i>Transferring completed, datafile.</i>

13:49.871 --> 13:51.206
Complete?

13:51.289 --> 13:53.875
No, wait! Cancel delete command.
Recover data!

13:54.167 --> 13:56.336
<i>Do you wish a printout
of students whose records</i>

13:56.420 --> 13:58.046
<i>match your parameters?</i>

13:58.380 --> 13:59.506
You bet I do!

14:08.557 --> 14:11.309
My God! I don't believe it!

14:12.602 --> 14:13.602
Terry!

14:16.189 --> 14:17.315
A Joker?

14:26.199 --> 14:27.451
Hey, Max!

14:30.037 --> 14:31.037
Are you okay?

14:31.580 --> 14:33.420
You hardly said a word
walking home last night.

14:33.707 --> 14:35.542
I was looking over my shoulder.

14:35.625 --> 14:37.878
I had the weirdest feeling
there was a Joker nearby.

14:38.170 --> 14:40.797
They won't bother you anymore.
I promise.

14:41.798 --> 14:44.092
- I guess you'd know.
- What?

14:45.010 --> 14:48.346
- Terry, you coming or not?
- Uh, hang on.

14:49.181 --> 14:50.474
We'll talk later, okay, Max?

14:51.391 --> 14:53.060
I suppose I owe you that much.

14:53.477 --> 14:54.603
But, I... Oh.

15:00.776 --> 15:03.320
Terry, meet me at
the Gotham Park Water Fountain

15:03.403 --> 15:05.238
at 8:00 tonight to talk

15:05.322 --> 15:07.074
or I blow your secret wide open.

15:07.908 --> 15:09.576
That should get his attention.

15:23.673 --> 15:24.673
Terry?

15:27.052 --> 15:28.595
I should have known.

15:28.678 --> 15:30.097
Looky, looky.

15:30.180 --> 15:31.848
It's Ms. Perfect 2400.

15:32.516 --> 15:34.726
The luckiest girl
on the face of the planet.

15:35.894 --> 15:36.894
Until now.

15:44.736 --> 15:47.364
I'm slagged.
I'm going straight to sleep.

15:50.075 --> 15:52.994
You'd never catch me going to bed
at eight o'clock if I didn't have to.

15:53.411 --> 15:55.622
You would if you worked for Mr. Wayne.

15:55.705 --> 15:56.705
Twip.

16:00.919 --> 16:02.879
Ooh! Someone's got e-mail!

16:03.213 --> 16:05.465
Probably a love note from Dana.

16:05.632 --> 16:06.967
Mwah, mwah, mwah.

16:08.593 --> 16:09.593
Ah!

16:10.595 --> 16:11.805
Scram, armpit!

16:20.939 --> 16:21.982
Oh, no.

16:23.608 --> 16:26.570
That's right, Maxine.
I know who you are.

16:27.070 --> 16:29.739
I know who you are, too, Terry!

16:30.532 --> 16:32.242
McGinnis?

16:33.160 --> 16:34.286
She thinks I'm McGinnis.

16:37.122 --> 16:40.208
I know he's one of you!
He told you I'd be here!

16:40.292 --> 16:41.918
No one told us anything.

16:42.627 --> 16:44.004
We've been following you.

16:44.171 --> 16:45.755
To finish off what we started.

16:46.131 --> 16:47.757
Because of this?

16:49.009 --> 16:50.009
Wrong again!

16:50.218 --> 16:52.262
I don't care about your data-crunching.

16:52.345 --> 16:54.389
I have a more personal reason
for wanting you gone.

16:55.432 --> 16:57.350
Who are you?

16:57.434 --> 16:59.936
Me, I'm the best.

17:02.022 --> 17:04.774
Help! Somebody help!

17:04.858 --> 17:06.498
Who do you think's
gonna hear you, Maxine?

17:06.776 --> 17:09.279
Who do you think's
gonna come to help you?

17:17.037 --> 17:18.914
- Run!
- You called it!

17:20.290 --> 17:21.833
Not what I meant.

17:40.393 --> 17:42.270
Come out, come out, wherever you...

17:46.858 --> 17:47.858
Why, you little...

17:54.699 --> 17:55.699
Max!

17:59.287 --> 18:00.914
Forget about me, Batman.

18:01.248 --> 18:02.249
You got the girl, Trey?

18:03.375 --> 18:05.335
- Yeah, I got her.
- Good.

18:30.944 --> 18:33.989
Carter? Carter Wilson?

18:41.329 --> 18:42.914
Well, I guess
that blows it for Carter.

18:42.998 --> 18:45.250
He'll never be valedictorian now.

18:45.333 --> 18:47.460
Sure he will. ijuvie hall!

18:50.171 --> 18:52.132
I always knew Carter was a loser.

18:52.674 --> 18:54.843
Yeah, me, too. A loser.

18:59.723 --> 19:02.392
I guess I'm not as good
a programmer as I thought.

19:02.475 --> 19:04.728
Carter wasn't even on my list
of possible Jokerz.

19:05.729 --> 19:06.855
But you were.

19:10.942 --> 19:11.985
Wait, you don't think...

19:12.360 --> 19:15.238
I did. But now I know the truth.

19:21.411 --> 19:22.596
What are you gonna do about it?

19:22.620 --> 19:24.622
First thing I'm going to do
is go cover my tracks

19:24.706 --> 19:26.249
so no one else can figure out...

19:26.333 --> 19:27.542
you know.

19:29.669 --> 19:32.255
- It's been taken care of.
- By whom?

19:34.215 --> 19:35.342
A friend.

19:35.425 --> 19:37.510
He's a real expert in covering tracks.

19:39.095 --> 19:40.555
This changes everything, you know.

19:40.889 --> 19:42.265
Maybe for the better.

19:42.349 --> 19:44.351
At least now you're
not alone with your secret.

19:44.893 --> 19:46.394
You have someone to talk to.

19:46.478 --> 19:48.855
Someone who can help you out
sometimes if you need it.

19:49.064 --> 19:50.899
Help me out? How?

19:51.274 --> 19:53.026
So where were you last night?

19:53.109 --> 19:54.736
You told me you had a free evening!

19:54.819 --> 19:57.614
Did the great Mr. Wayne snap
his fingers for you again?

19:57.697 --> 19:58.823
Or did you just forget?

19:59.240 --> 20:01.201
I'm sorry, Dana. It was my fault.

20:01.284 --> 20:03.364
I was supposed to sit with Matt,
but I had to cancel.

20:03.411 --> 20:05.330
And Terry got stuck babysitting.

20:06.706 --> 20:07.540
Oh.

20:07.624 --> 20:09.417
Well, babysitting.

20:09.501 --> 20:10.794
I guess that's all right.

20:10.877 --> 20:12.629
Family does come first.

20:12.879 --> 20:14.297
We'll make it up...

20:16.883 --> 20:17.883
somehow.

20:21.888 --> 20:23.640
Maybe this could work out after all.

20:23.723 --> 20:25.642
Just one thing, McGinnis.

20:26.768 --> 20:29.145
You call me Robin,
and I'm outta here.

20:29.437 --> 20:31.022
No problem...

20:31.106 --> 20:32.106
Alfred.

20:33.149 --> 20:34.149
Alfred?
