00:16.992 --> 00:20.159
Max, I came here to
talk to you alone.

00:23.826 --> 00:27.125
You were supposed to
deliver a package to my boss

00:27.159 --> 00:28.460
two days ago.

00:30.893 --> 00:31.793
He's done waiting.

00:38.492 --> 00:40.159
You've got 24 hours.

00:41.559 --> 00:43.427
And if you don't
deliver in 24 hours,

00:46.759 --> 00:49.192
you know what's gonna happen.

00:57.626 --> 01:00.325
Man, that guy really
needs to get laid, huh?

01:07.893 --> 01:09.692
It only gets better
from here on in.

01:11.526 --> 01:13.992
And your loyalty will
be rewarded.

01:14.025 --> 01:15.793
You know we never let
you down, right?

01:15.826 --> 01:18.259
But we have been taking
a lot of risk lately.

01:18.292 --> 01:20.726
A lot of unnecessary risks.

01:20.759 --> 01:23.025
And I'm not complaining.

01:23.058 --> 01:24.292
I'm just saying that...

01:24.325 --> 01:26.793
What they're
trying to say is...

01:26.826 --> 01:29.726
That we're locked and
loaded and ready for whatever.

01:33.393 --> 01:35.092
Guys, it's Friday,

01:36.159 --> 01:37.092
let's have a drink.

01:39.292 --> 01:41.025
I want you to go out

01:41.058 --> 01:42.692
and I want you to burn
some steam off

01:43.759 --> 01:46.925
because I want you to be
ready for the main event.

01:46.958 --> 01:47.726
We all need it.

01:49.992 --> 01:53.360
You still haven't told us
the plan for this week boss.

01:53.392 --> 01:54.159
What plan?

01:55.292 --> 01:57.426
Oh yeah, the plan.

01:58.826 --> 02:00.092
I'll lay it out in time.

02:01.859 --> 02:03.392
Now is not the time for work.

02:05.793 --> 02:07.526
Business is great.

02:07.559 --> 02:08.459
Life is good.

02:10.025 --> 02:11.659
You know what they say,

02:11.692 --> 02:15.058
All work and no play
makes Jack an asshole.

02:18.025 --> 02:21.192
That's why I insist you guys
go out and enjoy yourselves.

02:22.426 --> 02:23.492
I'm all for that boss.

02:24.759 --> 02:27.559
I just wanna be ready when the
time comes to have your back

02:27.592 --> 02:29.925
and the sooner I know what
I need to know,

02:29.958 --> 02:31.259
the better I can do my job.

02:34.958 --> 02:36.259
Did I say something wrong?

02:38.925 --> 02:40.092
No, not at all.

02:41.759 --> 02:44.726
I just had a moment of clarity.

02:45.659 --> 02:47.359
You see, you're the most
recent addition

02:47.392 --> 02:48.359
to my security team

02:50.992 --> 02:52.793
so I had a background
check on you

02:54.025 --> 02:54.859
and guess what?

02:56.559 --> 02:57.526
You came out clean.

03:01.359 --> 03:02.192
Spy clean.

03:04.192 --> 03:05.826
And then yesterday,

03:05.859 --> 03:08.592
a colleague of mine told
me that she knew you

03:09.726 --> 03:10.726
by Kniffen dang

03:12.225 --> 03:14.392
Imagine my surprise when
I saw a picture

03:14.426 --> 03:15.659
of you together in Turkey.

03:18.125 --> 03:19.426
I still didn't believe it,

03:21.192 --> 03:22.226
until now.

06:44.559 --> 06:46.492
Salam Aleikum my friend.

06:47.759 --> 06:49.026
Aleikum Salam.

06:51.793 --> 06:53.292
Who the hell was that guy?

06:53.325 --> 06:54.125
Oh him?

06:54.159 --> 06:55.026
A spy.

06:55.059 --> 06:56.325
Enemy brought us over here

06:56.359 --> 06:58.359
to make sure this
transaction won't happen.

06:59.426 --> 07:01.359
Then they know you've
been feeding me intel.

07:01.392 --> 07:04.292
Yeah, it means I'm suspected.

07:04.325 --> 07:06.392
If I was made, I would be dead.

07:07.958 --> 07:11.426
Still, what's gonna happen
when this guy doesn't show up?

07:12.426 --> 07:13.325
I'm not worried.

07:13.359 --> 07:15.259
I shot him with the
weapon you gave me.

07:15.292 --> 07:16.759
They track it back to us troops.

07:16.793 --> 07:17.659
Exactly.

07:18.592 --> 07:19.859
That means they're gonna know

07:19.893 --> 07:21.325
you've been feeding me intel.

07:21.359 --> 07:23.893
Look, I can take
care of myself.

07:23.925 --> 07:25.859
I feel like you're not
understanding me.

07:25.893 --> 07:26.859
You're burned.

07:26.893 --> 07:27.993
We gotta get you out of here.

07:28.026 --> 07:28.826
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

07:28.859 --> 07:29.659
Not possible my friend.

07:29.692 --> 07:30.692
Not possible, okay?

07:30.726 --> 07:32.192
I cannot leave.

07:32.225 --> 07:32.993
Why?

07:38.259 --> 07:39.092
That's why.

07:42.192 --> 07:43.092
She's beautiful.

07:43.125 --> 07:44.092
Who is she?

07:44.125 --> 07:45.659
She's my wife.

07:45.692 --> 07:46.692
We met in secret

07:46.726 --> 07:49.225
so that way my enemies
won't know my weakness.

07:51.459 --> 07:53.259
Today I found that she
was pregnant.

07:55.292 --> 07:56.592
Congratulations.

07:57.959 --> 07:59.225
Thank you.

07:59.259 --> 08:01.426
Now you see why I can't leave

08:01.459 --> 08:04.959
and why the money you
pay me very much, I need.

08:04.993 --> 08:06.025
I almost forgot.

08:06.058 --> 08:06.959
I didn't.

08:14.526 --> 08:15.659
So what do you got for me?

08:15.692 --> 08:16.492
Yes, yes.

08:16.526 --> 08:17.225
Business, business, business.

08:18.492 --> 08:22.325
Three groups of 30 coming down
to US compound post tonight.

08:23.192 --> 08:25.325
Very heavy firepower

08:25.359 --> 08:26.793
but they travel light.

08:26.826 --> 08:28.459
So no tanks or
anything like that.

08:31.125 --> 08:32.559
We need to fortify defenses.

08:32.592 --> 08:34.058
Not necessarily.

08:34.092 --> 08:36.192
Let's just say bring 200 troops

08:36.225 --> 08:39.259
to the South by midnight.

08:39.292 --> 08:40.626
You should kill them easily.

08:42.492 --> 08:43.292
Much obliged.

08:44.292 --> 08:48.025
Oh, and thanks for
saving my life again.

08:48.058 --> 08:48.859
No problem.

08:48.893 --> 08:50.859
You'd do the same for me, no?

08:50.893 --> 08:51.759
Yeah.

08:51.793 --> 08:52.793
I hope so.

08:52.826 --> 08:54.025
Yes.

08:54.058 --> 08:54.859
Good.

08:54.894 --> 08:55.692
Because I've hearing rumors

08:55.726 --> 08:58.192
that I've not been
liking too much.

08:58.225 --> 08:59.359
What kind of rumors?

08:59.392 --> 09:01.025
Your President is meeting

09:01.058 --> 09:02.759
with the Turkish
President tonight.

09:04.958 --> 09:06.459
Probably some
political bullshit.

09:06.492 --> 09:07.325
No.

09:07.359 --> 09:08.759
Significance, friend,
significance.

09:08.793 --> 09:09.992
The Kurds I've been working

09:10.025 --> 09:11.292
with the US forces for years.

09:11.325 --> 09:12.726
Thousands have died already.

09:13.726 --> 09:15.359
Now, I'm not worried
about myself too much.

09:15.392 --> 09:16.426
I know my faith, Allah.

09:16.459 --> 09:17.292
I know I've been here.

09:17.325 --> 09:19.058
I know where I'm going to

09:19.092 --> 09:19.958
but if that happens

09:19.992 --> 09:22.392
you please tell me if
you hear anything

09:22.426 --> 09:23.759
of any withdrawal.

09:23.793 --> 09:24.626
Please, urgency.

09:24.659 --> 09:25.894
Tell me.

09:25.926 --> 09:27.559
Not to worry about me but Aisha.

09:28.726 --> 09:29.926
I think your worrying
about nothing

09:29.958 --> 09:32.692
but of course I got you.

10:25.092 --> 10:28.159
You look like you've been
in the desert for a week.

10:28.192 --> 10:30.092
Did you get anything good?

10:30.125 --> 10:32.925
About 90 Skinnies headed
toward base camp tonight.

10:34.794 --> 10:35.893
I love it.

10:35.925 --> 10:37.559
Why is that funny?

10:37.592 --> 10:39.659
We've got a surprise
waiting for them.

10:39.692 --> 10:41.659
We're gonna barbecue those
sons of bitches

10:42.626 --> 10:44.626
Why? we got a new
weapon or something?

10:45.592 --> 10:46.893
Dude, he's been in desert.

10:46.925 --> 10:49.392
He hasn't seen the
news or anything.

10:49.426 --> 10:50.659
Will somebody
please cut the shit

10:50.692 --> 10:51.659
and tell me what's going on.

10:51.692 --> 10:53.492
We got orders from
the Commander in Chief

10:53.526 --> 10:55.692
to vacate this hell hole.

10:55.726 --> 10:56.859
We're redeploying today.

10:57.925 --> 10:59.827
Base are already empty Sheph.

10:59.859 --> 11:02.559
Well, you know, except
for the C4 we left behind.

11:03.726 --> 11:05.125
We're leaving?

11:05.159 --> 11:07.092
Get the Arabic out
of your brain

11:07.125 --> 11:09.626
and listen to the words that
are coming out of my mouth.

11:09.659 --> 11:11.592
You go home now.

11:32.359 --> 11:34.092
In
International news,

11:34.125 --> 11:35.925
Following the US
President's decision

11:35.958 --> 11:38.159
to withdraw all troops
from the region,

11:38.192 --> 11:40.325
abandoning it's Kurdish allies,

11:40.359 --> 11:42.692
Turkish forces have moved
in slaughtering

11:42.727 --> 11:45.659
thousands of Kurdish
fighters and civilians.

13:22.492 --> 13:24.893
David,
It's me.

13:26.492 --> 13:27.893
I woke up and you were gone.

13:30.492 --> 13:33.459
Anyway, last night was fun.

13:34.559 --> 13:35.392
Call me.

13:46.726 --> 13:50.259
David, it's
dad obviously.

13:50.292 --> 13:53.526
You didn't show up for your
job interview at the firm.

13:53.559 --> 13:56.192
I don't know what
you're trying to do,

13:56.225 --> 13:58.325
but I can't keep
putting my reputation

13:58.359 --> 14:00.025
on the line for you.

14:00.058 --> 14:00.793
Call me.

14:05.092 --> 14:07.659
Shepherd,
it's Dr. Schwab from the VA.

14:07.692 --> 14:09.627
You missed your
appointment this morning

14:09.659 --> 14:12.159
so I was just calling to
make sure you're okay.

14:12.192 --> 14:14.492
You may not think your
therapy's working

14:14.526 --> 14:17.192
but I assure you we're
making progress.

14:17.225 --> 14:19.092
Please be sure to reschedule it.

14:26.560 --> 14:27.692
Alina?

14:27.726 --> 14:28.526
Yes.

14:28.560 --> 14:30.159
Drive fast.

14:30.192 --> 14:30.958
Okay.

14:50.759 --> 14:52.292
Rough day?

14:52.325 --> 14:53.359
You don't even know.

14:55.159 --> 15:00.159
They say
bartenders and drivers

15:01.092 --> 15:02.259
are the best listeners.

15:03.826 --> 15:06.192
You look like you have
enough problems of your own.

15:06.225 --> 15:07.092
No offense.

15:08.359 --> 15:09.659
Everybody has problems.

15:09.692 --> 15:11.225
Everybody sleeps in their car?

15:13.726 --> 15:17.225
Smells like morning
breath and sex.

15:18.259 --> 15:19.192
What?

15:19.225 --> 15:20.392
I have parents.

15:20.426 --> 15:21.192
I know.

15:24.159 --> 15:26.225
I thought we were
talking about you.

15:26.259 --> 15:27.192
Trust me.

15:27.225 --> 15:28.426
You don't wanna know.

15:28.459 --> 15:29.225
Try me.

15:31.992 --> 15:34.159
I just saw something horrible.

15:43.159 --> 15:44.359
What the hell?

15:48.859 --> 15:49.826
Who are you?

15:49.859 --> 15:51.493
I'm nobody, I swear.

15:51.527 --> 15:53.359
Nobody wants to kill
nobody that bad.

15:56.025 --> 15:57.925
Wait, what are you doing?

15:57.958 --> 15:59.058
Get down.

16:42.526 --> 16:43.659
What's your passcode.

16:43.692 --> 16:45.025
I need to call my parents.

16:45.058 --> 16:46.626
I don't recommend it, not yet.

16:47.826 --> 16:49.460
Why?

16:49.492 --> 16:51.192
If someone's after you,

16:51.225 --> 16:52.559
your parents could get
caught in the crossfire,

16:52.592 --> 16:53.925
and you don't want that.

16:53.958 --> 16:56.659
So then what are we
supposed to do now?

16:56.692 --> 16:59.726
Let's start with
trying to figure out

16:59.759 --> 17:00.925
who's trying to kill you.

17:00.958 --> 17:02.392
I don't know.

17:02.427 --> 17:03.526
You have to know.

17:03.559 --> 17:05.492
What were you trying
to tell me in the car?

17:05.526 --> 17:06.793
You saw something horrible.

17:07.759 --> 17:09.492
My best friend Natalia and I,

17:09.526 --> 17:10.925
we go to St. Mary's School

17:10.958 --> 17:12.359
and she left her
book at my house

17:12.392 --> 17:13.592
so I went to return it.

17:14.659 --> 17:17.526
The front door was open
so I walked inside.

17:17.559 --> 17:19.125
When I got to the kitchen

17:19.159 --> 17:21.559
I saw a man stab
Natalia's father

17:22.559 --> 17:25.192
and I ran away but I
think he saw me.

17:27.826 --> 17:30.058
What does Natalie's
father do for a living?

17:30.092 --> 17:32.492
I don't know, but
they're rich.

17:32.526 --> 17:34.659
Expensive cars, nice house.

17:34.692 --> 17:35.459
All of that.

17:38.058 --> 17:41.692
Hey, why aren't you more
freaked out about all this?

17:42.958 --> 17:44.359
It didn't happen to me.

17:44.393 --> 17:45.192
It did.

17:45.225 --> 17:47.259
There's bullet holes
in your car.

17:47.292 --> 17:48.992
Do you want me to freak out?

17:49.025 --> 17:50.492
No, but I don't want
you to accept it

17:50.526 --> 17:51.992
like a psychopath either.

17:54.759 --> 17:56.292
You ask a lot of questions.

17:56.325 --> 17:57.292
So do you.

17:59.426 --> 18:00.759
I was in the army, okay?

18:02.025 --> 18:02.992
That's cool.

18:03.025 --> 18:03.958
What'd you do?

18:03.992 --> 18:05.526
Intelligence.

18:05.559 --> 18:07.793
You, intelligence?

18:07.826 --> 18:10.393
I expect an intelligence
guy to be all nerdy

18:10.426 --> 18:11.958
and reading data all day.

18:11.992 --> 18:13.292
I did that too.

18:14.159 --> 18:15.192
Those are analysts.

18:15.225 --> 18:16.225
I did that too

18:16.259 --> 18:20.192
but mostly human Intel and
interrogations.

18:21.058 --> 18:21.992
That's cool.

18:22.025 --> 18:23.259
Why'd you leave?

18:23.292 --> 18:24.526
Long story.

18:24.559 --> 18:25.826
Tell me.

18:25.859 --> 18:26.826
Some other time.

18:26.859 --> 18:28.526
Let's focus on
keeping you alive.

18:29.459 --> 18:31.058
Okay, so now what?

18:31.092 --> 18:33.058
You must have a plan.

18:33.092 --> 18:34.426
Bad guys always have a plan.

18:36.893 --> 18:38.326
I'm working on one.

18:38.360 --> 18:40.092
Working on one?

18:40.125 --> 18:42.292
Maybe we need an analyst.

18:42.326 --> 18:43.092
Very funny.

18:54.692 --> 18:55.526
Get in the car.

18:57.459 --> 18:58.360
In the front seat.

19:22.293 --> 19:23.992
This is your home?

19:24.925 --> 19:26.025
Well, technically.

19:26.058 --> 19:27.859
It's my dad's house.

19:27.893 --> 19:29.359
You still live with your dad?

19:30.793 --> 19:32.826
He's old.

19:32.859 --> 19:33.726
He gets lonely.

19:35.826 --> 19:36.759
Make yourself at home

19:36.793 --> 19:37.726
I'll be right back.

20:06.092 --> 20:06.958
David Shepherd?

20:07.859 --> 20:09.859
Who the hell is asking?

20:09.893 --> 20:10.992
Howard Baskis.

20:13.826 --> 20:15.260
Z sends her regards.

20:21.159 --> 20:22.893
Who the hell is Z?

20:52.793 --> 20:54.092
Hello.

20:54.125 --> 20:56.526
Oh hi, you must be
David's dad.

20:56.559 --> 20:59.159
I am and who are you,
young lady?

21:00.793 --> 21:01.893
Alina.

21:01.925 --> 21:03.958
Well, hello Alina.

21:03.992 --> 21:05.692
Where is my son?

21:05.726 --> 21:06.592
I don't know.

21:06.626 --> 21:07.992
He went to go get the mail

21:08.025 --> 21:10.492
but I think he went to
get food or something.

21:10.526 --> 21:12.492
He told me to make
myself a home.

21:12.526 --> 21:13.759
Oh, he did, did he?

21:14.859 --> 21:17.826
Well, let me call him.

21:24.225 --> 21:27.893
This is
David, leave a message.

21:27.925 --> 21:32.859
Well, seems like it's
just you and I.

21:36.592 --> 21:38.292
Have you eaten?

21:38.325 --> 21:40.859
No, I'm starving.

21:40.893 --> 21:43.126
Well, join me in the kitchen.

21:45.859 --> 21:47.392
So you like sandwiches?

21:47.426 --> 21:48.292
Yes.

21:48.325 --> 21:51.359
So what did my son
tell you about me?

21:52.325 --> 21:53.192
Not much.

21:53.225 --> 21:56.526
Just that you're old and lonely.

21:56.559 --> 21:57.759
Really?

21:57.793 --> 22:00.325
But it seems like you have
it more together than he does.

22:01.559 --> 22:06.559
Well, my son is going
through a rough patch right now

22:08.992 --> 22:13.592
and he's keeping it together.

22:13.626 --> 22:15.992
Definitely from his time
in the military

22:16.025 --> 22:20.726
and obviously he's
got a big heart.

22:20.759 --> 22:21.692
I mean, you're here.

22:22.626 --> 22:27.259
So tell me, how how
did y'all meet?

22:27.292 --> 22:28.259
He picked me up.

22:28.292 --> 22:29.126
Picked you up?

22:30.058 --> 22:31.559
Yeah, Rideshare.

22:32.459 --> 22:33.859
Rideshare, yes.

22:36.426 --> 22:37.692
Good, so go on.

22:39.692 --> 22:42.058
Calub, you seem like a
really nice guy

22:42.093 --> 22:45.259
and I don't really wanna
cause problems

22:45.292 --> 22:48.526
but there's more to
how I met David.

22:48.559 --> 22:51.459
You see, when David
picked me up,

22:51.492 --> 22:53.726
I saw something horrible.

22:54.692 --> 22:58.093
I saw my best friend's
dad get stabbed.

23:00.392 --> 23:02.392
I'm so sorry.

23:02.426 --> 23:05.159
I know it must be
really hard on you.

23:05.192 --> 23:06.225
I'm going through it.

23:07.559 --> 23:10.592
Well listen, you're in
the right place.

23:11.726 --> 23:14.259
Like I said, my son's
got a big heart

23:14.292 --> 23:16.793
and he knows what he's doing.

23:16.826 --> 23:18.426
You can depend on him.

23:18.459 --> 23:20.893
So we wait for him.

23:20.925 --> 23:24.392
And for now we'll have
some sandwiches and...

23:24.426 --> 23:25.292
Video games.

23:25.325 --> 23:27.859
And play some video games,
of course.

24:27.192 --> 24:28.026
Welcome.

24:29.225 --> 24:31.325
Oh, don't be so antisocial

24:31.359 --> 24:32.893
just because you've been
running around town,

24:32.925 --> 24:34.559
keeping us from our targets.

24:35.492 --> 24:37.058
Who the hell are you people?

24:37.092 --> 24:40.726
We are an
organization of heroes.

24:40.759 --> 24:42.459
We protect America
from the threat

24:42.492 --> 24:44.492
of asymmetrical warfare

24:44.526 --> 24:46.826
by providing intelligence

24:46.859 --> 24:50.125
and occasionally getting
rid of human scum.

24:51.659 --> 24:52.726
Mercenaries.

24:53.826 --> 24:54.893
Hmm.

24:54.925 --> 24:56.459
I hate labels.

24:56.492 --> 24:59.793
So go ahead, ask your
next question.

24:59.826 --> 25:00.726
I know you want to.

25:02.392 --> 25:03.259
Why am I here?

25:03.292 --> 25:04.459
Bingo.

25:04.492 --> 25:06.058
Why are you here?

25:06.092 --> 25:07.092
Hmm.

25:07.125 --> 25:09.459
Is it because you took
out our best operative?

25:11.025 --> 25:13.459
No, we don't take any prisoners.

25:13.492 --> 25:15.726
We kill our enemies
and we move on.

25:16.726 --> 25:17.659
Okay, so why then?

25:19.159 --> 25:22.058
The only reason that
you're alive right now

25:22.092 --> 25:24.793
is because I believe
that you can be useful.

25:25.992 --> 25:27.426
I checked you out.

25:27.459 --> 25:30.392
Your Delta, highly decorated,

25:32.192 --> 25:34.826
has a problem with authority.

25:34.859 --> 25:37.392
When authority does
the wrong things.

25:38.759 --> 25:39.592
Touche.

25:40.592 --> 25:42.225
I have a proposition for you.

25:43.359 --> 25:45.559
The girl you're protecting,

25:45.592 --> 25:47.159
she's collateral damage.

25:48.159 --> 25:50.459
She witnessed our operative,

25:50.492 --> 25:54.125
taking out someone that
desperately needed to be killed.

25:54.159 --> 25:55.659
He was an enemy of the State.

25:56.592 --> 25:58.759
She's just a kid who's
she gonna tell?

25:59.793 --> 26:02.793
Shepherd, we operate
in the shadows.

26:02.826 --> 26:06.392
As insignificant as that
little girl is,

26:06.426 --> 26:08.192
she can bring us to the ground.

26:08.225 --> 26:10.192
Don't act like you don't
understand that.

26:11.192 --> 26:12.592
So what's the proposition?

26:14.793 --> 26:16.225
You do a job for us

26:17.526 --> 26:18.826
and we'll leave her alone.

26:21.459 --> 26:22.392
What's the job?

26:23.626 --> 26:25.025
I'm sorry, was that a yes?

26:30.992 --> 26:35.492
One kill and you
leave her alone forever.

26:37.860 --> 26:38.692
One kill

26:40.793 --> 26:43.125
The Target's name is
Maximiliano Che.

26:44.159 --> 26:46.726
He is an international
arms dealer specializing

26:46.759 --> 26:48.092
in biological weapons.

26:55.259 --> 26:59.092
How do I know you're not
gonna just kill her anyway

26:59.125 --> 27:00.426
after I do this job for you?

27:01.492 --> 27:05.159
You don't, you roll the dice

27:05.192 --> 27:06.860
or she dies today.

27:06.893 --> 27:07.659
Up to you.

27:11.359 --> 27:12.192
Go on.

27:13.259 --> 27:15.459
We lost a man on our
last mission.

27:15.492 --> 27:17.392
He was gathering Intel on Che

27:17.426 --> 27:19.426
until his cover was blown.

27:19.459 --> 27:21.859
Che, killed him in cold blood.

27:21.893 --> 27:24.426
However, we did find out

27:24.459 --> 27:27.025
what he was planning to
sell and when.

27:27.058 --> 27:30.125
What we know is it's a
weapon of mass destruction

27:30.159 --> 27:33.859
created by Eve Howell,
American scientist.

27:34.992 --> 27:37.859
What we don't know is
how it works

27:37.893 --> 27:39.626
and who he's planning
to sell it to.

27:40.692 --> 27:42.159
So what's the play?

27:42.192 --> 27:44.125
Che is a ghost.

27:44.159 --> 27:46.726
Eve Howell, she's your best bet.

27:46.760 --> 27:48.692
That's where you need to start.

27:48.726 --> 27:50.559
You know what will
happen if you fail.

27:52.859 --> 27:53.692
I won't.

28:10.459 --> 28:12.359
Hey, I'm Maxine.

28:12.392 --> 28:13.626
Shepherd.

28:13.659 --> 28:16.058
Here to support
your operation.

28:16.092 --> 28:18.893
And well, used to
work for the NSA

28:18.925 --> 28:21.292
but I was too forward
thinking for them.

28:21.325 --> 28:22.559
I'm an anarchist,

28:22.592 --> 28:23.925
born in several countries.

28:23.958 --> 28:26.492
I'm mobile and don't
have many friends.

28:26.526 --> 28:27.692
I don't buy it.

28:27.727 --> 28:29.192
I do.

28:29.225 --> 28:30.893
Here's your assault pack.

28:30.925 --> 28:32.526
Weapons, other useful gadgets.

28:34.826 --> 28:35.692
What's this?

28:35.727 --> 28:37.992
That is an acid bomb.

28:39.592 --> 28:41.426
Activate it, you have
five seconds.

28:42.259 --> 28:43.859
So deactivate it.

28:49.225 --> 28:50.992
So am wearing a helmet
camera or what?

28:51.025 --> 28:52.125
Do you wear contacts?

28:52.159 --> 28:52.925
No.

28:54.025 --> 28:55.159
Now you do.

28:55.192 --> 28:57.125
We watch your every move.

28:57.159 --> 28:57.992
I also took the Liberty

28:58.025 --> 28:59.459
of checking out the scientist.

28:59.492 --> 29:00.727
She'll be at the gala tomorrow.

29:00.759 --> 29:02.793
I'll be shutting off all of
the electricity in her car

29:02.826 --> 29:04.426
and the rest is up to you.

29:04.459 --> 29:05.559
Any questions?

29:07.058 --> 29:09.192
My car got set up,

29:09.225 --> 29:10.727
can you give me a new one?

29:10.759 --> 29:13.058
What do you want?

29:13.092 --> 29:14.192
Lamborghini.

29:15.125 --> 29:17.125
We'll get yours fixed.

30:20.225 --> 30:23.292
What seems to be the problem?

30:23.325 --> 30:26.426
Let me guess,
you're a mechanic?

30:26.459 --> 30:27.893
I know a little something.

30:27.925 --> 30:28.925
Pop the hood.

30:42.559 --> 30:43.392
I got you.

31:07.225 --> 31:09.125
Problem is
definitely electrical.

31:10.958 --> 31:12.492
I was gonna have this with you.

31:14.893 --> 31:16.626
How about I call you
a tow truck?

31:17.893 --> 31:20.593
You know what, I'm
really in a hurry.

31:20.626 --> 31:23.292
Do you think you can give
me a ride to my event?

31:24.426 --> 31:25.526
Well, it depends.

31:26.560 --> 31:27.925
You're not crazy or anything,
are you?

31:29.292 --> 31:31.459
We all have our triggers,
good and bad.

31:33.025 --> 31:35.626
I'll just have to stay
on those good triggers now.

31:36.659 --> 31:37.492
Let's go.

31:47.659 --> 31:49.560
So if you don't mind my asking,

31:51.225 --> 31:52.492
what do you do for a living?

31:55.759 --> 31:56.793
I'm a secret agent.

31:57.925 --> 31:58.759
Mm hmm.

31:59.893 --> 32:01.359
What kind of missions?

32:02.958 --> 32:04.626
Mostly international stuff.

32:05.992 --> 32:08.527
I'm like the black female 007.

32:11.292 --> 32:15.692
Okay, we might run
some of the same circles.

32:16.759 --> 32:20.125
Wow, you're gullible

32:20.159 --> 32:22.292
You have an honest face, okay?

32:22.325 --> 32:23.092
What can I say?

32:24.292 --> 32:25.659
I'm a scientist.

32:27.159 --> 32:30.159
A very boring scientist.

32:30.192 --> 32:31.992
I doubt that.

32:32.025 --> 32:32.759
It's true.

32:33.826 --> 32:36.859
I mean, don't get me wrong.

32:38.292 --> 32:39.292
I love my job

32:39.325 --> 32:43.559
and I guess it's just
not what it used to be.

32:43.592 --> 32:44.992
Well, I can relate to that.

32:46.359 --> 32:47.659
My last job was like that.

32:49.125 --> 32:50.726
Really?

32:50.759 --> 32:51.527
Yeah.

32:53.058 --> 32:54.392
Is this one better?

32:56.292 --> 32:57.559
It's too early to tell.

32:59.259 --> 33:00.359
But right now,

33:03.192 --> 33:04.359
I really like my job.

33:08.592 --> 33:12.325
So yeah, when I first started

33:13.460 --> 33:15.025
I thought I was gonna
change the world

33:15.058 --> 33:16.992
one scientific
discovery at a time.

33:19.659 --> 33:22.992
I was hired to cure very
powerful disease

33:23.025 --> 33:25.325
that I can't mention due to
my nondisclosure agreement.

33:26.559 --> 33:30.427
And I found the cure but it
was hidden from the public.

33:32.925 --> 33:35.793
Too much money in the
treatment drugs.

33:35.826 --> 33:36.626
Exactly.

33:38.659 --> 33:41.992
And then I discovered
an anti-aging formula

33:42.025 --> 33:46.159
that really worked and
still it was suppressed.

33:46.192 --> 33:46.958
Wow.

33:48.159 --> 33:50.292
My latest discovery would make

33:50.325 --> 33:52.692
the entire world safer
from extreme weather.

33:54.626 --> 33:56.559
I donated that one to the
US government.

33:56.592 --> 33:58.759
That way, if they try
to suppress it,

33:58.793 --> 34:00.526
I can still share it
with the world.

34:02.793 --> 34:04.359
Sounds like a game changer.

34:06.058 --> 34:07.592
Yeah I hope so.

34:07.626 --> 34:08.492
I truly do.

34:10.427 --> 34:13.659
I just wanna, you know,
leave my mark

34:13.692 --> 34:15.092
and do my part, you know.

34:17.325 --> 34:18.159
I do.

34:19.325 --> 34:20.659
I definitely do.

35:31.726 --> 35:33.492
The sedative worked.

35:33.526 --> 35:34.692
Nicely done.

35:34.726 --> 35:36.293
Didn't swallow any, did you?

35:36.326 --> 35:38.092
No sleeping on the job.

35:38.125 --> 35:38.893
I'm good.

35:40.826 --> 35:41.692
What do I do now?

35:43.359 --> 35:44.759
Old one.

35:44.793 --> 35:46.492
Old one?

35:48.159 --> 35:51.659
I'm running a program that
analyzes her buying trends

35:51.692 --> 35:55.025
to determine most likely
password choices.

35:55.058 --> 35:55.826
Almost there.

35:57.459 --> 35:58.326
Alright.

35:58.359 --> 36:03.259
Try capital S science girl one.

36:07.692 --> 36:09.492
I'm in, Wow.

36:09.526 --> 36:10.992
You need to be hacking banks.

36:12.025 --> 36:13.058
Who says I haven't?

36:14.260 --> 36:16.392
Okay, so what's next?

36:16.426 --> 36:20.526
All right, type in this
code in the search bar

36:29.025 --> 36:29.859
Now hit Enter.

36:31.092 --> 36:32.092
Done.

36:32.125 --> 36:33.392
Good.

36:33.426 --> 36:35.559
I'm accessing her files now.

36:35.592 --> 36:37.359
Get out of there before
she wakes up.

36:43.925 --> 36:46.426
Eve Howell, scientist.

36:46.459 --> 36:48.859
Eve was hired by the
Department of Energy

36:48.893 --> 36:51.125
to create a device that
would prevent a hurricane

36:51.159 --> 36:53.025
from reaching shore.

36:53.058 --> 36:56.159
The device creates a
current inside the storm

36:56.192 --> 36:59.058
which effectively cancels
out the hurricane.

36:59.092 --> 37:02.292
Unfortunately Howell's
supposed contact

37:02.325 --> 37:04.925
turned out to be one of the
Che's men, Nicholas Garner.

37:06.159 --> 37:09.226
Che's purpose of the device
was always meant to be used

37:09.260 --> 37:11.659
as a weapon of mass destruction,

37:11.692 --> 37:13.592
sold to the highest bidder.

37:13.626 --> 37:15.058
A weather bomb.

37:15.092 --> 37:19.426
Deployed on land the device
can destroy any structure

37:19.459 --> 37:22.592
within a 20 mile radius

37:22.626 --> 37:27.492
killing hundreds and
thousands in the process.

37:27.526 --> 37:29.726
We believe Che
has a buyer.

37:29.759 --> 37:32.958
We've identified his
location as this house.

37:34.259 --> 37:38.292
Get in, get Che
and get out.

37:38.325 --> 37:40.659
And
don't get caught.

38:55.692 --> 38:57.225
Excuse me, but can I help you?

38:59.025 --> 38:59.859
Probably.

39:01.359 --> 39:02.225
Will you?

39:04.392 --> 39:06.159
That is the question.

39:08.659 --> 39:09.859
I'm here with my husband.

39:09.893 --> 39:11.192
Oh, I know.

39:12.893 --> 39:13.893
Happy anniversary.

39:17.025 --> 39:18.592
Look I'm gonna call security.

39:20.626 --> 39:23.392
Someone's gonna kill the
man you're in love with.

39:23.426 --> 39:24.626
My husband, why?

39:26.058 --> 39:30.192
Not your husband, the
man you're in love with.

39:32.225 --> 39:33.958
The man you spent
last night with

39:34.893 --> 39:37.093
on your supposed business trip.

39:43.592 --> 39:44.526
What do you want?

39:49.392 --> 39:51.426
Just some honest conversation

39:53.093 --> 39:55.125
between two people with a
lot of secrets.

39:58.059 --> 39:58.925
Well, talk fast.

39:58.958 --> 40:00.292
He'll be back in a minute.

40:01.626 --> 40:06.626
He's got a lot of body
guards, a lot body guards.

40:12.392 --> 40:14.026
But when death comes for Reyes,

40:16.292 --> 40:19.259
it wont come when he's
surrounded by his body guards

40:20.826 --> 40:24.092
it will come when he's
at his most vulnerable.

40:25.859 --> 40:29.759
Can you imagine when he's
at his most vulnerable?

40:32.526 --> 40:34.225
When he's with me?

40:34.259 --> 40:35.026
Bingo.

40:36.159 --> 40:41.159
See, the thing is death
doesn't like witnesses.

40:44.259 --> 40:46.259
So what do you think that
means for you?

40:48.659 --> 40:50.359
They'll kill me too.

40:50.392 --> 40:51.159
Indeed.

40:55.592 --> 40:57.692
So I guess this is where
your story ends.

41:00.359 --> 41:01.259
What a waste.

41:09.659 --> 41:10.492
Unless,

41:15.225 --> 41:17.392
unless you tell me exactly

41:20.925 --> 41:25.893
where and when Reyes will
be alone and vulnerable.

41:33.292 --> 41:34.192
I'll find a way.

41:41.359 --> 41:44.392
Text me at this
number when you do.

41:49.359 --> 41:50.859
I don't even know your name.

41:53.159 --> 41:56.459
Trust me, you're better
off not knowing.

42:18.992 --> 42:20.526
I thought teenagers
were supposed

42:20.559 --> 42:22.626
to be good at video games?

42:22.659 --> 42:25.859
Looks like your fears are
about to get disappointed.

42:26.759 --> 42:28.492
Don't worry about me, old man.

42:28.526 --> 42:29.592
Old man?

42:29.626 --> 42:31.859
I'm just giving you a
false sense of security

42:31.894 --> 42:33.025
before I break you.

42:33.058 --> 42:33.526
Really?

42:33.559 --> 42:34.692
Really, watch it.

42:34.726 --> 42:39.225
Well, this old man is feeling
pretty secure right now.

42:39.826 --> 42:41.592
So I guess it's working.

42:46.459 --> 42:47.259
Hello?

42:47.292 --> 42:48.092
Yes.

42:48.125 --> 42:49.125
Hey dad, it's me.

42:49.159 --> 42:50.359
David.

42:50.392 --> 42:51.392
Let me talk to him.

42:53.292 --> 42:55.392
Hi David.

42:55.426 --> 42:58.292
I just wanted to
tell you thanks.

42:59.159 --> 43:00.759
I know you don't have to do this

43:02.392 --> 43:05.192
but well, that's it I guess.

43:09.592 --> 43:13.860
David, your little
friend told me everything.

43:13.894 --> 43:15.992
Yeah, it's
been a complicated day.

43:16.025 --> 43:18.259
How the heck did you
get yourself mixed up

43:18.292 --> 43:19.025
in all this mess?

43:20.259 --> 43:22.726
I'm just trying
to do the right thing, dad.

43:22.759 --> 43:23.759
The right thing?

43:23.793 --> 43:25.958
Who are these people?

43:25.992 --> 43:27.559
Can't
tell you that.

43:28.925 --> 43:32.392
Well, tell me, are we
in any danger?

43:32.426 --> 43:34.592
Not if I do
what they asked me to do.

43:34.626 --> 43:37.192
Well, what are they
asking you to do?

43:37.225 --> 43:39.192
I can't tell
you that either.

43:41.159 --> 43:46.159
Alright David, just, be
careful out there, all right?

43:49.692 --> 43:50.526
David?

44:29.192 --> 44:30.192
Hey Shepherd.

44:30.225 --> 44:31.292
Yeah.

44:31.325 --> 44:32.794
Don't shoot the bomb.

44:32.826 --> 44:34.559
You see him shooting at me,
right?

44:36.159 --> 44:39.359
Kevlar vest is fortified
to deal with pistols

44:39.392 --> 44:40.760
so you can take it.

44:40.794 --> 44:43.092
As long as I
don't get shot in the face.

44:43.125 --> 44:43.859
Exactly.

44:49.626 --> 44:50.794
Titanium
crystals my ass

44:50.826 --> 44:51.592
that shit hurt.

44:52.726 --> 44:54.526
Cant believe you fell
for that one.

44:54.559 --> 44:56.359
I'm starting
to not like you.

45:26.159 --> 45:26.925
Mumbles.

45:36.727 --> 45:41.259
Maxine, that sound is
coming from that device.

45:43.659 --> 45:44.992
Is that normal?

45:46.492 --> 45:47.992
I don't know.

45:48.025 --> 45:49.325
It's counting down.

45:50.259 --> 45:51.992
How do I stop it?

45:52.025 --> 45:52.893
I don't know.

45:52.958 --> 45:54.092
You don't know?

45:54.125 --> 45:56.727
That's literally your only job.

45:56.759 --> 45:58.459
I'm a hacker not a wizard.

45:58.492 --> 46:01.192
It's not built with any
deactivation feature.

46:02.125 --> 46:03.826
The only person who
will know is...

46:05.727 --> 46:06.559
Eve.

46:11.559 --> 46:12.392
Hello

46:13.526 --> 46:17.693
David, so nice to hear from you.

46:17.726 --> 46:19.392
You got a moment?

46:19.426 --> 46:20.159
Yeah, sure.

46:20.192 --> 46:21.058
What's going on?

46:21.092 --> 46:24.492
So I really don't know
how to say this

46:25.359 --> 46:27.526
but I need your help.

46:27.559 --> 46:28.660
So I'm just gonna say it.

46:28.693 --> 46:29.925
That's how I like it.

46:29.958 --> 46:32.826
Raw and real

46:33.925 --> 46:35.259
Hello.

46:35.292 --> 46:36.058
Eve, I'm a spy.

46:37.526 --> 46:39.793
Well, the government
agent kind of.

46:41.025 --> 46:42.859
Okay, I get it.

46:42.893 --> 46:45.159
You're trying to get me back
for that secret agent joke.

46:45.192 --> 46:46.793
Very funny.

46:47.660 --> 46:49.359
No Eve, not funny.

46:49.392 --> 46:50.692
The device that you created

46:50.726 --> 46:52.992
for the Department of
Energy to save people

46:53.025 --> 46:56.925
from hurricanes is
being weaponized on land

46:56.958 --> 46:59.058
to produce mass casualties.

46:59.092 --> 47:02.092
I was hired to stop the
sale from happening.

47:02.125 --> 47:03.426
And I did that

47:03.459 --> 47:07.392
but I accidentally triggered
the five minute timer.

47:08.859 --> 47:11.292
If you don't help me a
hundred thousand people

47:11.325 --> 47:12.092
are gonna die.

47:13.259 --> 47:14.392
Including us.

47:16.192 --> 47:17.958
Did you just say five
minute timer?

47:17.992 --> 47:19.958
How could you
possibly know that?

47:19.992 --> 47:21.526
Because I'm telling the truth.

47:24.259 --> 47:27.459
Okay listen, you won't
be able to open the case

47:27.492 --> 47:30.125
without an
authorized hand print.

47:30.159 --> 47:32.426
There's a rectangular section

47:32.459 --> 47:34.593
on the side of the case.

47:34.627 --> 47:35.692
That will activate it.

47:36.627 --> 47:37.692
Okay, one sec.

47:39.559 --> 47:40.859
Wait, don't move the device.

47:40.893 --> 47:43.025
If you move it, it will
self-destruct

47:43.058 --> 47:44.392
and override the timer.

48:03.759 --> 48:04.626
Okay.

48:04.659 --> 48:05.459
All right, I have the print.

48:05.492 --> 48:06.292
Now what?

48:06.325 --> 48:07.092
Okay.

48:08.359 --> 48:12.359
Gently, gently open the case.

48:13.593 --> 48:17.958
Listen, do not move that case
from its current position.

48:20.759 --> 48:22.359
No pressure.

48:22.392 --> 48:23.259
Okay, here we go.

48:25.759 --> 48:28.325
It made a different noise
but it's still counting down.

48:28.359 --> 48:29.726
Okay, that's fine.

48:29.759 --> 48:32.325
It just means you have
90 seconds to enter in

48:32.359 --> 48:34.125
the deactivation code.

48:34.159 --> 48:36.325
You can only enter it
in one time.

48:36.359 --> 48:38.192
So you can't miss a number.

48:38.225 --> 48:38.992
Understand?

48:41.159 --> 48:44.426
Okay, yeah I got it.

48:44.459 --> 48:45.793
Let's go.

48:45.826 --> 48:50.759
The 12 digit code is seven,
two.

49:00.259 --> 49:01.092
Eve.

49:02.259 --> 49:03.092
Eve.

49:04.659 --> 49:05.493
Eve.

49:13.292 --> 49:14.125
Any ideas?

49:17.493 --> 49:19.292
I got nothing.

49:19.325 --> 49:21.459
Okay, what was the
passport on the laptop?

49:23.092 --> 49:25.992
Signscore1.

49:26.025 --> 49:28.292
That's 12 characters.

49:28.325 --> 49:32.559
So we just need to assign
a number to each character

49:32.592 --> 49:33.826
that's not a number.

49:35.426 --> 49:37.692
Well, if we go by the phone

49:37.726 --> 49:40.826
that's three to four
possibilities for a number.

49:42.958 --> 49:46.092
But we can run a personality
test using the buying trends

49:46.125 --> 49:47.893
and see what I come up with.

49:49.058 --> 49:50.159
30 seconds.

49:52.025 --> 49:53.092
Okay. Got it.

49:53.125 --> 49:53.893
Type this in,

49:56.092 --> 50:01.092
nine, eight, five, three, seven,
seven, seven, eight, nine,

50:02.626 --> 50:03.659
six, seven, one.

51:47.826 --> 51:48.692
Hi.

51:48.726 --> 51:49.559
Delivery from Ms Yvonne.

51:49.592 --> 51:50.958
Okay, thank you.

51:58.292 --> 52:01.893
This video was sent to
us an hour ago.

52:09.326 --> 52:11.859
Why? Who are they?

52:12.759 --> 52:14.225
They work for the
would-be buyer

52:14.259 --> 52:16.092
of the device that
you intercepted.

52:17.293 --> 52:18.925
They will torture her

52:18.958 --> 52:21.726
until she agrees to
manufacture another device.

52:23.859 --> 52:25.192
She won't do it.

52:25.225 --> 52:26.259
How do you know?

52:28.326 --> 52:29.726
Eve is...

52:29.759 --> 52:30.958
She's a true believer.

52:30.992 --> 52:32.392
She's on some Zen shit.

52:32.426 --> 52:34.826
Something about every person

52:34.859 --> 52:37.659
has a role to play
in this world.

52:37.692 --> 52:38.659
Now that she knows

52:38.692 --> 52:41.592
that the device won't
be used to save lives

52:41.626 --> 52:42.793
she won't recreate it.

52:44.426 --> 52:45.726
She will die soon.

52:47.559 --> 52:49.025
No, she's not.

52:50.526 --> 52:52.526
Where are they taking her?

52:52.559 --> 52:53.392
Columbia.

52:57.260 --> 52:59.492
Passport with your alias,
plane tickets

52:59.526 --> 53:00.925
and a photo of Reyes.

53:05.893 --> 53:08.058
You sending a team with me?

53:08.092 --> 53:08.859
No.

53:09.826 --> 53:12.225
This mission is unsanctioned.

53:13.526 --> 53:15.925
The US government hired
us to neutralize

53:15.958 --> 53:17.893
the threat of attack by
eliminating Che.

53:20.025 --> 53:21.925
Disarming the bomb,

53:21.958 --> 53:23.925
that was a bonus

53:23.958 --> 53:26.226
but that'll keep us in business.

53:26.260 --> 53:28.426
It's an added value if you will.

53:29.958 --> 53:31.925
But saving Eve Howell,

53:31.958 --> 53:35.192
that is not a priority
on the US government list

53:35.226 --> 53:36.359
at this time.

53:36.392 --> 53:37.692
But if she was to make...

53:37.726 --> 53:41.125
As such, we have to
limit our exposure

53:42.260 --> 53:43.759
in case something goes wrong.

53:44.692 --> 53:46.726
Unfortunately, that's
all the support

53:46.759 --> 53:48.092
I can give you at this time.

53:49.659 --> 53:50.559
Happy hunting.

53:54.659 --> 53:55.492
Also.

54:01.125 --> 54:02.459
What's this?

54:02.492 --> 54:03.259
Cyanide.

54:04.692 --> 54:06.859
The government has no
connection to you

54:08.359 --> 54:12.259
and has no authority to
act against Reyes.

54:12.292 --> 54:14.726
Reyes is ex CIA.

54:14.759 --> 54:16.459
He's a master interrogator.

54:16.492 --> 54:20.459
He'll make you wish for
death for years

54:20.492 --> 54:23.325
only to kill you after you
tell him what he wants to know.

54:27.160 --> 54:29.992
If you're captured,
take the pill.

55:41.426 --> 55:42.492
You lost me?

55:44.225 --> 55:45.692
Yvonne's sends her regards.

55:47.359 --> 55:51.259
So what can the CIA do for
Yvonne and her team today?

56:03.459 --> 56:04.292
I see.

56:07.392 --> 56:09.726
You know I do a lot of
business with Reyes.

56:11.659 --> 56:14.692
Is Yvonne prepared to
compensate me for my losses?

56:16.059 --> 56:17.359
Check your bank account.

56:27.426 --> 56:30.325
Now you're talking
my language.

56:30.359 --> 56:33.025
I need weapons and a location.

56:35.093 --> 56:37.559
He's not gonna be an
easy mark, you know.

56:37.592 --> 56:38.925
I'm not expecting one.

56:43.826 --> 56:48.092
He and his men recently
acquired a scientist.

56:49.526 --> 56:53.225
So I'm guessing you
want her back.

56:56.259 --> 56:57.592
I'll get you what you need.

57:16.459 --> 57:17.292
Like it?

57:19.192 --> 57:20.392
It's a bit dusty,

57:20.426 --> 57:22.125
needs some cleaning

57:22.159 --> 57:23.192
but it had its charm.

57:26.192 --> 57:28.426
We are in a wartime bunker.

57:28.459 --> 57:32.325
This is designed to protect
politicians, presidents

57:32.359 --> 57:33.893
and the elite of my country.

57:36.392 --> 57:38.592
We're 10 stories underground.

57:38.626 --> 57:40.793
This is one of the safest
places in the world

57:42.925 --> 57:45.225
and the last place anybody
will ever find you.

57:47.859 --> 57:48.692
So?

57:49.659 --> 57:51.359
You're the fine one,
aren't you?

57:52.392 --> 57:53.893
Let me make this easy on me.

57:55.159 --> 57:57.459
I'm not gonna make you
the bomb and that's it.

57:58.492 --> 58:00.826
You fooled me once but
now that I know

58:00.859 --> 58:02.292
what you plan to do
with the device,

58:02.325 --> 58:04.325
I'd rather die.

58:04.359 --> 58:05.626
The value of my life
is defined...

58:05.659 --> 58:08.526
By the good that we do in
the world, blah, blah, blah.

58:08.559 --> 58:10.392
I know what you're gonna say.

58:10.426 --> 58:13.259
I've read your best
selling science book

58:14.459 --> 58:15.292
and it's boring.

58:16.225 --> 58:18.159
It's boring as hell.

58:18.192 --> 58:18.959
Teaches all

58:20.192 --> 58:21.926
Indeed my dear, indeed.

58:22.926 --> 58:25.392
So if you know I'm
not gonna build the bomb

58:25.426 --> 58:27.092
how come you just get
it over with?

58:28.459 --> 58:31.025
Your boss is gonna make
you torture me until I die.

58:32.426 --> 58:35.192
So you think you've got
it all figured out, huh?

58:35.225 --> 58:37.092
I watch a lot of movies.

58:37.125 --> 58:39.793
Well, that's where
you're wrong.

58:41.592 --> 58:42.659
I don't have a boss.

58:43.893 --> 58:45.192
I am the boss.

58:46.225 --> 58:50.592
In fact, my media company
has helped elect

58:50.626 --> 58:51.992
the past three presidents.

58:53.659 --> 58:54.793
And for my next trick

58:56.492 --> 58:58.526
I'm gonna get myself
elected President.

59:00.759 --> 59:02.759
The only thing
standing in the way

59:02.793 --> 59:06.025
is your government
supporting another candidate.

59:08.325 --> 59:10.859
He's a puppet

59:10.894 --> 59:11.759
He's a pun.

59:15.459 --> 59:17.292
I am not a pun

59:20.292 --> 59:22.759
And the first thing I
would do as President

59:22.793 --> 59:25.058
is release my country

59:25.092 --> 59:27.992
from US economic and
political influence.

59:33.325 --> 59:37.492
And you're gonna help me
by delivering a credible

59:37.526 --> 59:40.793
and devastating threat,
your device.

59:46.259 --> 59:48.559
Why don't you just take
the $50 million?

59:48.592 --> 59:49.626
The offer is still on the table.

59:49.659 --> 59:50.426
It's for you.

59:51.592 --> 59:53.392
Use that to buy some
breath mints.

1:00:07.459 --> 1:00:09.092
Very well.

1:00:09.125 --> 1:00:13.359
Look around, in this room
are all the components needed

1:00:14.726 --> 1:00:16.159
for you to finish the device.

1:00:17.492 --> 1:00:19.292
It needs to get done.

1:00:19.325 --> 1:00:20.159
Do you understand?

1:00:24.259 --> 1:00:28.192
We'll be watching and you
were right about one thing,

1:00:29.492 --> 1:00:30.992
if you don't complete it,

1:00:31.025 --> 1:00:32.860
you will die of starvation.

1:04:23.225 --> 1:04:24.325
You want me to
finish him boss?

1:04:24.359 --> 1:04:25.958
No, no, no, no, no.

1:04:27.759 --> 1:04:29.726
Your never give you my

1:04:29.759 --> 1:04:30.359
bomb.

1:04:30.392 --> 1:04:33.025
I want you to go to the US

1:04:33.058 --> 1:04:34.058
and give me my money.

1:04:34.958 --> 1:04:36.325
I'll take care of this guy.

1:04:42.159 --> 1:04:43.992
Now, this is nice.

1:04:44.025 --> 1:04:46.259
This is a nice surprise.

1:04:47.359 --> 1:04:50.259
My CIA contact told me
I might go to visitor.

1:04:51.526 --> 1:04:55.292
And I thought who would be so
stupid to come look for me?

1:04:57.292 --> 1:05:00.992
But I know now that
this, this is personal.

1:05:04.793 --> 1:05:06.958
I know you're looking for Eve.

1:05:06.992 --> 1:05:08.560
I don't know what
you see in her.

1:05:09.925 --> 1:05:11.125
She's hard to work with.

1:05:12.359 --> 1:05:14.225
One thing's for sure,

1:05:14.259 --> 1:05:15.459
She loves pain

1:05:17.192 --> 1:05:18.859
and I think that's very sexy.

1:05:22.893 --> 1:05:23.958
Did I cut your nerve?

1:05:25.459 --> 1:05:26.325
Don't worry about it.

1:05:26.359 --> 1:05:27.692
You'll never find her.

1:05:27.726 --> 1:05:31.560
She's at a place that nobody
will ever find her, okay?

1:05:39.259 --> 1:05:40.559
I've always liked baseball

1:05:44.493 --> 1:05:45.992
but you know what?

1:05:46.025 --> 1:05:47.759
Football has always
been my sport.

1:05:51.759 --> 1:05:52.958
But again like they say,

1:05:53.992 --> 1:05:55.692
it's never too late to learn,
huh?

1:06:07.259 --> 1:06:10.259
So if you're not with a CIA.

1:06:10.292 --> 1:06:11.726
You're here alone.

1:06:13.159 --> 1:06:15.426
And that means you're a
man in the know

1:06:15.460 --> 1:06:17.692
and you must have the
information that I need.

1:06:18.559 --> 1:06:21.159
I need you to tell
me everything.

1:06:21.192 --> 1:06:22.025
All of it.

1:07:46.893 --> 1:07:47.726
Eve.

1:07:57.759 --> 1:07:58.992
Is she safe?

1:07:59.025 --> 1:07:59.259
How did you...

1:07:59.992 --> 1:08:02.225
Cyber spy anarchist, shepherd.

1:08:02.259 --> 1:08:03.292
Give me a break.

1:08:03.325 --> 1:08:04.292
She's not here.

1:08:05.659 --> 1:08:07.058
Where is Reyes?

1:08:07.092 --> 1:08:07.859
Dead.

1:08:08.859 --> 1:08:09.958
Okay, give me a sec.

1:08:12.225 --> 1:08:13.659
Reyes has 10 properties

1:08:13.692 --> 1:08:15.360
but most of them are commercial

1:08:15.393 --> 1:08:18.793
and the building scans are
showing no hidden rooms,

1:08:18.826 --> 1:08:22.526
no trap doors, trick,
walls, nothing like that.

1:08:24.659 --> 1:08:27.492
I'm sorry Shepherd,
there's nothing I can do.

1:08:55.058 --> 1:08:58.859
Maxine, are any of
his buildings

1:08:58.893 --> 1:09:00.826
built on top of
older structures?

1:09:02.526 --> 1:09:03.359
Checking.

1:09:05.893 --> 1:09:07.025
Jackpot.

1:09:07.058 --> 1:09:09.359
His television studio is
built on the site

1:09:09.392 --> 1:09:11.326
of an underground bunker.

1:09:11.359 --> 1:09:13.659
That has to be when
they're keeping her.

1:09:13.692 --> 1:09:15.025
And how do I get there?

1:09:15.058 --> 1:09:17.925
There's has to be an
anomaly somewhere

1:09:18.759 --> 1:09:22.025
but you don't see.

1:09:23.426 --> 1:09:24.893
Here we go.

1:09:24.925 --> 1:09:25.726
There's a private elevator.

1:09:25.759 --> 1:09:26.592
That has to be it.

1:09:28.058 --> 1:09:29.092
Send me the coordinates.

1:09:29.125 --> 1:09:30.592
I'm on my way.

1:09:30.626 --> 1:09:33.192
Okay, but I don't
work pro bono.

1:09:33.225 --> 1:09:35.192
You survive this you
better get a job

1:09:35.225 --> 1:09:37.025
so you can pay my fee.

1:09:37.958 --> 1:09:39.359
You know where to find me.

1:10:06.925 --> 1:10:08.359
10 seconds.

1:10:08.392 --> 1:10:10.159
All right, copy that.

1:10:10.192 --> 1:10:11.559
Welcome to Reyes's studio.

1:10:12.426 --> 1:10:14.392
AKA propaganda TV.

1:10:26.925 --> 1:10:28.426
Wait.

1:10:28.459 --> 1:10:29.226
Two on patrol.

1:10:37.826 --> 1:10:40.125
I thought you
said this was lightly guarded?

1:10:40.159 --> 1:10:43.092
It is, it just happens
to be bad timing.

1:10:43.125 --> 1:10:43.893
Go now.

1:11:41.958 --> 1:11:43.958
Shepherd, you're about
to lose the connection.

1:11:43.992 --> 1:11:45.893
The signal is getting weak.

1:11:45.925 --> 1:11:47.025
I'm sending you the coordinates

1:11:47.058 --> 1:11:48.958
of the elevator to your phone.

1:11:48.992 --> 1:11:50.392
Watch your six.

1:11:50.426 --> 1:11:51.225
Copy that.

1:12:31.492 --> 1:12:32.992
Eve.

1:12:33.025 --> 1:12:33.793
Eve.

1:12:44.992 --> 1:12:45.826
Eve.

1:12:47.325 --> 1:12:48.159
Eve.

1:12:56.859 --> 1:12:57.692
Shepherd.

1:13:00.225 --> 1:13:01.925
Yeah it's me, Eve.

1:13:01.958 --> 1:13:02.726
You're safe now.

1:13:08.325 --> 1:13:10.659
Get me out of here
before I eat you.

1:13:56.492 --> 1:13:58.392
I can tell that
you're new to this.

1:14:00.492 --> 1:14:02.092
So let me explain it to you.

1:14:06.292 --> 1:14:07.893
Everything's business.

1:14:09.058 --> 1:14:10.125
Nothing's personal.

1:14:12.125 --> 1:14:16.125
You pay more than he
does and you get more.

1:14:17.392 --> 1:14:18.225
You get it?

1:14:19.626 --> 1:14:21.192
So now you have leverage on me.

1:14:25.092 --> 1:14:29.159
So here, how about this
for an offer?

1:14:31.325 --> 1:14:33.025
I'll pass.

1:14:33.058 --> 1:14:34.692
I don't like empty promises.
