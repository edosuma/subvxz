02:43.705 --> 02:45.499
No!

02:46.792 --> 02:48.836
Let's go!

02:58.011 --> 03:00.055
Ninjas.

04:11.126 --> 04:13.170
The forensic team found nothing.

04:13.295 --> 04:17.966
According to a neighbour, Major Carter
left around 8. 30 Saturday morning.

04:18.091 --> 04:20.552
That's over 48 hours.

04:20.677 --> 04:25.474
The police found Sam's car outside
a fitness club 12 blocks from her house.

04:26.099 --> 04:28.769
- Anything else?
- No witnesses.

04:31.230 --> 04:34.566
We have no jurisdiction
outside this facility, Colonel.

04:34.858 --> 04:37.194
I know.

04:37.319 --> 04:40.322
We can still look, can't we?

05:08.225 --> 05:10.894
- Good morning, Major.
- What's going on? Where am I?

05:11.019 --> 05:13.689
- In a hospital.
- What happened?

05:13.772 --> 05:15.816
We just need to run a few tests.

05:15.941 --> 05:18.944
What tests? Why am I restrained?

05:19.027 --> 05:20.571
No, stop!

05:20.654 --> 05:22.531
No!

05:31.498 --> 05:34.334
Feet, I said! Look at his feet.

05:34.418 --> 05:37.588
Feet like that... Huge!

05:37.671 --> 05:41.466
Never trust a man with feet that big.

05:41.592 --> 05:43.719
Hi there.

05:44.136 --> 05:47.472
Go away. This is my stuff.

05:47.556 --> 05:50.893
I just wanna ask you
a couple of questions.

05:50.976 --> 05:53.020
You got a dollar?

05:54.229 --> 05:56.440
Here's two.

05:56.565 --> 05:58.525
Thanks.

05:58.984 --> 06:02.863
- Were you around here Saturday?
- Why should I tell you?

06:04.072 --> 06:07.743
- I gave you two dollars.
- I thought you were just being generous.

06:10.412 --> 06:12.873
How generous do I have to get?

06:19.630 --> 06:22.090
- You a cop?
- Air Force.

06:22.216 --> 06:26.011
- Colonel Jack O'Neill.
- I was in Nam.

06:26.136 --> 06:30.516
- Yeah? What company?
- Oh, vacation. Long time ago.

06:34.436 --> 06:39.358
A friend of mine disappeared
from around here on Saturday morning.

06:39.483 --> 06:42.986
A woman, about five nineish, blonde.

06:44.029 --> 06:47.991
- You wouldn't believe me if I told ya.
- Why not?

06:48.617 --> 06:53.705
I'm just a crazy old guy
with a shopping cart full of cans.

06:55.207 --> 06:59.962
I'm just a cynical Air Force guy
with a closet full of National Geographic.

07:01.505 --> 07:03.549
Can I have'em?

07:05.008 --> 07:07.052
What do you know?

07:07.177 --> 07:09.596
She was feisty. Put up a fight.

07:10.806 --> 07:14.935
- With whom?
- Ninjas. Three, maybe four.

07:15.018 --> 07:18.939
Happened fast. They pulled up
in a white van, grabbed her.

07:20.274 --> 07:25.153
I've been telling the police about ninjas
for years. You think they listen?

07:27.030 --> 07:28.907
Right.

07:30.534 --> 07:32.411
OK.

07:33.328 --> 07:34.538
Thanks.

07:34.913 --> 07:38.167
You're gonna bring me
them magazines, right?

07:39.001 --> 07:40.878
You bet.

07:46.592 --> 07:49.928
So you think Maybourne's
a fan of Godzilla movies?

07:50.012 --> 07:55.184
- He strikes me more as a Mothra guy.
- I don't get it.

07:55.309 --> 07:59.271
NID agents use these sites
to post coded messages.

07:59.396 --> 08:02.733
If I know Maybourne,
he's keeping tabs on his old buddies.

08:02.816 --> 08:05.569
OK, what kind of message
you wanna send?

08:05.694 --> 08:09.823
Make it "Hutch, we need to talk. "

08:10.991 --> 08:13.118
Sign it "Starsky".

08:13.243 --> 08:15.287
He'll understand.

08:29.343 --> 08:33.263
We got the first blood test back.
You're gonna wanna see this.

08:33.388 --> 08:38.309
We found an unusual protein marker
and traces of an unidentified heavy metal.

08:38.434 --> 08:42.648
- What do you mean,"unidentified"?
- Nothing I've ever seen before.

08:42.731 --> 08:46.652
We'd better double- check these results
with the lab in Phoenix.

08:54.326 --> 08:59.832
She's strong. I gave her enough chloral
hydrate to put down a man twice her size.

09:02.626 --> 09:04.670
All right, Major.

09:39.872 --> 09:41.582
Hi, Jack.

09:41.665 --> 09:43.709
Don't turn around.

09:50.007 --> 09:52.092
Harry.

09:52.217 --> 09:54.094
Where you been?

09:54.178 --> 09:57.014
You never write, you don't call.

09:57.181 --> 10:00.434
- I have a gun.
- So do I.

10:00.601 --> 10:03.353
I'm trying to protect you.
I'm a wanted criminal.

10:03.478 --> 10:08.192
- It's your duty to arrest me, you know.
- Always thinking of the other guy.

10:08.984 --> 10:11.904
- How'd you find me?
- I played hide- and- seek as a kid.

10:12.029 --> 10:17.075
It's funny. I could always find anyone
anywhere, but they could never find me.

10:17.409 --> 10:19.494
Because they didn't wantto.

10:19.870 --> 10:22.623
What do you need, Jack?

10:22.706 --> 10:26.084
- Carter's missing.
- Really?

10:26.627 --> 10:29.796
Bunch of guys in a van took her
out of this lot four days ago.

10:29.922 --> 10:33.884
- I figured it was some of your old friends.
- Not the word I'd use for'em.

10:35.219 --> 10:37.429
What do you know?

10:37.554 --> 10:39.431
Sorry.

10:40.933 --> 10:45.145
You didn't come back into this country
and risk execution just to see me.

10:45.854 --> 10:49.691
God knows I can think of a hundred
reasons why the NID might want Carter,

10:49.816 --> 10:53.570
but I swear to you I don't know
where she is or why she was taken.

10:53.695 --> 10:55.781
Why don't you ask the NID?

10:55.906 --> 10:58.825
Gee, thanks. I hadn't thought of that.

11:00.327 --> 11:04.456
- Try user 4574.
- What does that mean?

11:04.581 --> 11:07.501
- Wish I could stay and chat.
- Harry...

11:09.127 --> 11:12.923
- We're talking about Carter here.
- I know.

11:13.048 --> 11:16.051
I'm sorry, Jack. I really am.

11:16.593 --> 11:20.097
You know how this game is played,
and the kind of people who play it.

11:20.222 --> 11:25.227
You've got to prepare yourself for the
possibility she may not be coming back.

11:33.694 --> 11:36.029
That's all he said?

11:36.154 --> 11:38.198
User 4574.

11:40.409 --> 11:42.619
I think we know who that is, Colonel.

11:52.754 --> 11:56.466
- Colonel O'Neill is still waiting, sir.
- I know.

11:56.592 --> 11:59.511
I'm sorry to bother you,
but he's getting a little...

11:59.636 --> 12:02.472
Pissed is the word.

12:02.556 --> 12:05.893
It happens when you keep
someone waiting two hours.

12:06.977 --> 12:10.063
Well, welcome to the Pentagon, Colonel.

12:11.773 --> 12:13.817
Thank you, Dolores.

12:14.902 --> 12:17.279
Forgive me. I have a lot on my plate.

12:17.404 --> 12:22.492
Just someone's life at stake. Sorry to take
you away from your turkey sandwich.

12:22.618 --> 12:24.661
It was a ham and cheese, actually.

12:24.786 --> 12:28.749
And I'm the one who's sorry
because you wasted a trip to Washington.

12:28.874 --> 12:30.918
I don't think so.

12:32.127 --> 12:37.090
You know, I was just recently reading
about Major Carter's disappearance.

12:37.216 --> 12:41.845
I couldn't help but wonder if glowing
aliens had something to do with it.

12:41.929 --> 12:46.767
Look, Simmons, I don't expect you
just to tell me what's going on,

12:47.017 --> 12:49.770
but I guarantee you
this trip will not be a waste.

12:49.895 --> 12:55.400
If I have to, I'll spend my life getting to the
bottom of all this and how it ties to you.

12:55.484 --> 12:58.070
Why do you think
I have something to do with this?

12:58.487 --> 13:00.531
A reliable source told me.

13:03.408 --> 13:05.452
I think I know who you're referring to.

13:05.577 --> 13:08.247
Are you telling me
you trust a convicted traitor?

13:08.747 --> 13:10.916
More than you at the moment.

13:11.041 --> 13:15.170
Look, your opinion of me and
this organisation has been tainted

13:15.295 --> 13:17.965
by the actions of the very man
you're talking about.

13:18.382 --> 13:20.759
I doubt very much he was acting alone.

13:21.176 --> 13:25.639
The NID is a legitimate organisation
financed by this government,

13:25.764 --> 13:28.767
which has been duly elected
by the people of this country.

13:28.851 --> 13:30.727
Damn, that has a familiar ring to it.

13:30.853 --> 13:35.774
- Our mandate is clear, Colonel.
- I'm a simple man. Explain it to me.

13:38.277 --> 13:44.324
We provide vital civilian oversight
of top- secret military operations.

13:44.449 --> 13:46.410
Yeah.

13:46.493 --> 13:48.620
And who watches over you?

13:50.956 --> 13:55.085
We're not unaccountable. There have
been minor indiscretions in the past,

13:55.210 --> 13:57.796
perpetrated by
a few renegade individuals.

13:57.921 --> 14:02.718
They've been exposed and will be brought
to justice, with or without your help.

14:02.843 --> 14:05.846
- Maybourne is pointing a finger at you.
- Yeah?

14:05.971 --> 14:10.601
Has it ever occurred to you that maybe
he's trying to mask his own involvement?

14:10.726 --> 14:14.229
- I'd need some convincing.
- We recently traced a deposit

14:14.354 --> 14:17.691
made into one of
Maybourne's offshore bank accounts.

14:17.774 --> 14:22.237
The transfer took place with a numbered
company on the Cayman Islands.

14:23.071 --> 14:25.365
$3 million?

14:25.532 --> 14:30.287
Yeah. Makes you kind of wonder
what he did to earn that kind of money.

14:31.622 --> 14:33.248
Doesn't it?

15:11.328 --> 15:16.375
The company that paid Maybourne
is a subsidiary of Zetatron Industries.

15:16.500 --> 15:20.546
- That sounds familiar.
- It's run by a man named Adrian Conrad.

15:21.672 --> 15:26.218
He made $200 million in something called
fibre- optic host- channel adapters,

15:26.301 --> 15:29.388
and then diversified before
the tech market bottomed out.

15:29.513 --> 15:33.725
Now he's into everything
from shipyards to sportswear factories.

15:33.851 --> 15:36.019
What is his connection to Maybourne?

15:36.144 --> 15:39.731
It's common for ex- spies
to sell information to the private sector.

15:39.857 --> 15:45.696
We know he's had access to extensive
files on the SGC and every SG-1 member.

15:45.821 --> 15:49.324
Interestingly, Conrad hasn't
been seen in public in six months.

15:49.449 --> 15:52.995
His last appearance was a video feed
from their head office in Seattle

15:53.120 --> 15:57.416
- to a Zetatron stockholders' meeting.
- Really not much to go on.

15:57.499 --> 16:02.754
The only other thing I can tell you is who
authorised the payment: Diana Mendez.

16:02.880 --> 16:07.509
She was Conrad's assistant and
the last person known to have seen him.

16:14.600 --> 16:18.478
- Working late?
- How did you get in here?

16:18.604 --> 16:23.692
Well, the ability to sneak around was
a prerequisite of my former occupation.

16:23.817 --> 16:25.861
What do you want?

16:27.196 --> 16:30.115
To know about the disappearance
of an Air Force major.

16:30.199 --> 16:34.119
- I've no idea what you're talking about.
- Then I should talk to your boss.

16:34.244 --> 16:36.121
He's unavailable.

16:37.664 --> 16:41.043
The other prerequisite
of my former occupation

16:41.168 --> 16:43.462
was an absence of moral conscience.

16:45.839 --> 16:49.551
It really gives you the freedom
to do whatever you have to do.

16:55.265 --> 16:57.309
Threats won't change what I know.

16:57.434 --> 17:02.689
This major disappeared after we closed
our deal. I believe it wasn't a coincidence.

17:02.814 --> 17:05.733
Adrian wouldn't be involved
in anything like that.

17:05.817 --> 17:07.694
Oh.

17:09.905 --> 17:12.824
Did he tell you what
you were buying for him?

17:13.282 --> 17:19.289
Something valued at $10m by a renegade
faction of Russian military intelligence,

17:19.373 --> 17:22.376
- less your cut, of course.
- Oh, well.

17:22.584 --> 17:26.547
- I don't know what it was exactly.
- I'm surprised.

17:26.672 --> 17:30.717
I thought you two had
a very close working relationship.

17:32.761 --> 17:36.098
I do my job and I don't ask questions.

17:36.181 --> 17:40.227
What if I told you it was enough uranium
to fuel a terrorist nuke?

17:40.352 --> 17:43.730
- Just how far would your loyalty go then?
- You're lying.

17:44.273 --> 17:46.149
Maybe.

17:46.233 --> 17:49.236
You made your deposit and you got paid.

17:49.319 --> 17:53.115
As far as I'm concerned,
our association is finished.

18:17.431 --> 18:21.476
- Harry.
- Jesus, Jack. You're stealing my routine.

18:21.602 --> 18:23.645
Consider it an homage.

18:23.770 --> 18:26.231
What's up?
I thought we trusted each other.

18:26.356 --> 18:28.400
You lied to me. Get in.

19:07.731 --> 19:09.775
Hello again, Major Carter.

19:11.485 --> 19:13.529
If you don't mind,

19:14.655 --> 19:16.865
I'd like to ask you a few questions.

19:20.702 --> 19:24.164
I don't know if I mentioned
what a thrill this is for me.

19:29.169 --> 19:35.008
I wish we didn't have to do it under these
conditions, but given the circumstances...

19:41.014 --> 19:44.184
You're a very unique individual.

19:44.268 --> 19:47.896
You may well hold the key
to the future of medical science.

19:49.523 --> 19:52.526
You've made a big mistake.

19:52.609 --> 19:57.239
We know what happened to you and that
you were the host of an alien symbiote.

19:57.573 --> 19:59.992
I'm a physicist.

20:03.120 --> 20:05.789
I study deep- space radar telemetry.

20:07.875 --> 20:12.713
Please, Major. Don't waste my time
with that ridiculous cover story.

20:17.676 --> 20:20.345
Tell me what you can about the symbiote.

20:24.183 --> 20:27.269
- She's never gonna talk.
- What about the tests?

20:27.352 --> 20:30.272
We have a couple of leads,
but nothing definite yet.

20:30.397 --> 20:33.150
- We're running out of time.
- I know.

20:33.275 --> 20:36.820
We may have to move the implantation
ahead of schedule.

20:51.084 --> 20:56.507
Technically, I didn't lie. I didn't know
where Carter was or why she was taken.

20:56.590 --> 20:58.467
What was the $3 million for?

20:59.801 --> 21:03.931
I acquired a piece of merchandise
from the Russians and sold it to Zetatron.

21:04.056 --> 21:05.933
What?

21:06.683 --> 21:08.727
- A symbiote.
- What?

21:08.852 --> 21:11.688
On their second mission,
when their gate was active,

21:11.813 --> 21:14.900
- the Russians ran into a group of Jaffa.
- I read that report.

21:15.108 --> 21:19.404
What the report didn't say was that
the Russians took one of the Jaffa alive.

21:19.488 --> 21:21.865
They've held him in custody ever since.

21:21.990 --> 21:24.493
Man, you gotta love those guys.

21:24.618 --> 21:27.955
- The Russians or the Jaffa?
- Both, actually.

21:29.164 --> 21:32.334
Apparently, the symbiote
was reaching maturity.

21:32.459 --> 21:35.796
I assumed Zetatron wanted it
for their biotech division.

21:35.963 --> 21:38.715
So why kidnap Carter?

21:38.841 --> 21:42.678
Carter once had a symbiote inside her,
and lived to talk about it.

21:44.012 --> 21:47.266
- How do they know that?
- I don't know.

21:47.391 --> 21:51.353
I also don't know how they found out
about me and my connections.

21:51.478 --> 21:55.232
But when people offer you $3m
you don't ask too many questions.

21:55.357 --> 21:56.817
Why not?

21:57.109 --> 22:01.947
- I never thought it would come to this.
- What did you think would happen?

22:02.072 --> 22:05.576
In the right hands, a symbiote
can lead to medical breakthroughs.

22:05.701 --> 22:08.370
What, you're a humanitarian now?

22:10.622 --> 22:13.041
Gonna turn me in?

22:13.167 --> 22:17.087
Actually, that overwhelming desire
to shoot you has come back.

22:18.589 --> 22:21.341
- But you still need me, Jack.
- Why?

22:21.466 --> 22:25.512
Because I know the name of the doctor
who took delivery of the symbiote.

23:10.641 --> 23:14.228
- We make a pretty good team, Jack.
- Shut up.

23:14.353 --> 23:18.649
If you get tired of the SGC, we could make
more money than you ever dreamed of.

23:18.815 --> 23:23.362
Hey, G Gordon, don't give me
another reason to shoot you, all right?

23:30.160 --> 23:32.204
I'm in.

23:35.791 --> 23:37.835
Adrian Conrad's medical file.

23:46.802 --> 23:52.057
Conrad is in the late stages of a very rare
disorder known as Burchardt's Syndrome.

23:52.182 --> 23:56.895
It affects the immune system, leaving
the body vulnerable to a host of diseases.

23:57.020 --> 23:59.857
And there's no known cure.

23:59.982 --> 24:04.027
- Except a symbiote's healing powers.
- That'd only work through implantation.

24:04.361 --> 24:08.824
They may be studying the symbiote,
trying to reproduce its healing properties.

24:08.949 --> 24:13.412
Carter's experience with Jolinar makes
her a valuable source of information.

24:13.871 --> 24:18.876
- What are their chances of success?
- We've researched this for some time, sir.

24:19.001 --> 24:22.754
I'd be greatly surprised
if they came up with the answers quickly.

24:22.880 --> 24:27.009
If they're trying to save this man's life,
they're running out of time.

24:27.092 --> 24:31.889
- How do we find him?
- He needs constant medical supervision.

24:32.014 --> 24:35.726
He must be in some kind of a hospital
or a well- equipped facility.

24:35.851 --> 24:38.145
Saint... something.

24:39.438 --> 24:42.691
I was checking out the holdings
of that numbered company...

24:42.816 --> 24:48.322
St Christina's. A hospital in the suburbs
of Seattle that's been shut for two years.

24:52.659 --> 24:56.580
I'll contact the local authorities.
You and Teal'c can meet O'Neill there.

24:57.206 --> 25:01.585
A jet will be prepped and ready to go
by the time you get to the airport.

25:29.238 --> 25:33.534
Security. Major Carter's missing.
She can't have gotten far.

26:07.734 --> 26:10.195
The exits are sealed, Major.

26:11.905 --> 26:14.408
Who are you?
What the hell am I doing here?

26:14.992 --> 26:18.704
My name is Adrian Conrad.

26:19.913 --> 26:21.957
You're here because of me.

26:23.292 --> 26:26.128
- Back off or I shoot him.
- Hah!

26:26.211 --> 26:27.838
Go ahead.

26:27.963 --> 26:30.966
If I let you go, I'm dead anyway.

26:32.509 --> 26:36.096
Please, Major Carter,
if you put the gun down,

26:36.471 --> 26:39.391
there's a very good chance
we can both live.

27:20.057 --> 27:23.644
I'm sorry about this, Major,
but I've run out of options.

27:24.645 --> 27:27.814
- What now?
- My immune system has been destroyed.

27:27.898 --> 27:31.568
- The damage is irreversible.
- I don't care! You have no right...

27:31.693 --> 27:35.906
The human race has progressed
because of men who broke the rules

27:36.031 --> 27:40.702
and risked everything,
most often because they had no choice.

27:41.370 --> 27:45.499
The only thing that can save me
is an alien symbiote.

27:45.582 --> 27:47.626
You call them Goa'ulds.

27:47.751 --> 27:52.047
- How do you know about that?
- We know about the Stargate. Everything.

27:52.673 --> 27:56.885
Then you must also know that a symbiote
would leave you a prisoner in your body.

27:57.010 --> 28:00.097
That's why we're working
on a way to have it removed.

28:00.222 --> 28:03.475
- And you're the key.
- It's beyond our medical science.

28:03.725 --> 28:07.437
You survived your encounter
with the alien Jolinar.

28:08.063 --> 28:11.400
That was different.
The symbiote made a conscious choice.

28:11.483 --> 28:15.863
Maybe so, but the process you went
through could provide us with answers.

28:16.321 --> 28:19.658
You can't deny being able to extract
a symbiote from a human host

28:19.783 --> 28:22.161
would be a monumental breakthrough.

28:22.619 --> 28:25.622
A lot of smart people
are working toward that end already.

28:25.998 --> 28:28.750
Maybe they aren't
quite desperate enough.

28:30.711 --> 28:32.754
Mr Conrad.

29:03.243 --> 29:06.413
Pulse is weak, blood pressure's dropping.

29:06.497 --> 29:08.999
We're running out of time.

29:09.166 --> 29:12.336
- Proceed with the implantation.
- You can't.

29:12.419 --> 29:15.839
- We put it in him, we may never get it out.
- We'll find a way.

29:15.964 --> 29:18.967
You don't know if the healing process
has a lasting effect.

29:19.051 --> 29:22.221
We're reasonably sure,
once the symbiote cures the disease...

29:25.057 --> 29:26.934
Diana.

29:29.937 --> 29:32.064
It's OK.

29:32.189 --> 29:35.609
Adrian, you can't do this. Please.

29:35.734 --> 29:37.778
It's my only chance.

29:42.157 --> 29:44.618
We're going to have to restrain him.

30:06.807 --> 30:09.893
Cover the exits.
And somebody watch that guy.

30:09.977 --> 30:13.605
Come on, Jack, this is my fault.
Let me try and help fix it.

30:14.815 --> 30:17.901
Fine. Grab a vest. You're with me.

30:17.985 --> 30:20.028
- Can I have my gun back?
- Go. No!

30:22.239 --> 30:24.908
Daniel, Teal'c, take the front entrance.

30:47.264 --> 30:49.933
BP stabilising.

30:50.058 --> 30:52.186
Vitals returning to normal.

30:52.311 --> 30:54.313
Incredible.

30:58.692 --> 31:00.569
Diana.

31:03.614 --> 31:07.534
- How do you feel?
- The pain is...

31:07.659 --> 31:09.995
is gone.

31:11.121 --> 31:13.957
We're gonna need to run a full set of tests.

31:16.960 --> 31:19.046
How long?

31:19.171 --> 31:21.215
For what?

31:24.676 --> 31:29.056
You said you'd find a way to get it out.
How long will you leave him this way?

31:29.139 --> 31:33.060
- We don't know what kind of effect...
- I don't give a damn! Get it out of him.

31:33.393 --> 31:38.148
- We have a bit of a problem in that area.
- What are you talking about?

31:38.273 --> 31:41.652
Major Carter's test results
clearly indicate she holds the key

31:41.777 --> 31:44.696
- to a safe extraction process.
- That's good.

31:44.822 --> 31:48.408
Unfortunately, we know just enough
to know the answers are there.

31:48.534 --> 31:50.410
We just can't get them.

31:51.119 --> 31:52.746
Why not?

31:52.871 --> 31:57.000
Because Adrian didn't approve
the method that's ultimately necessary.

31:57.417 --> 31:59.545
What does that mean?

31:59.670 --> 32:04.550
It would require direct examination
of her brain tissue.

32:12.349 --> 32:14.393
Do whatever it takes.

32:33.829 --> 32:36.832
- Can I help you?
- I need a doctor. I electrocuted myself.

32:36.915 --> 32:40.460
- You'll have to go somewhere else.
- I have insurance.

32:44.047 --> 32:47.301
- This hospital is closed.
- I said I electrocuted myself.

32:47.426 --> 32:50.679
- D'you have any idea what that feels like?
- No.

32:54.933 --> 32:56.977
Something like that.

33:09.198 --> 33:11.074
Freeze!

33:13.702 --> 33:15.746
Who are you?

33:18.707 --> 33:20.334
What are you doing here?

33:20.459 --> 33:22.085
Agh!

33:22.211 --> 33:24.087
Ah! Ah!

33:24.171 --> 33:26.840
You want me to watch your back or not?

33:34.598 --> 33:35.807
Hey!

33:36.141 --> 33:39.311
I know this has been
hard on you, Diana. I'm sorry.

33:40.729 --> 33:45.108
- I just want you to get better.
- I am better. I can feel it.

33:46.735 --> 33:50.489
If you just let me out of these restraints,
I could show you.

33:51.365 --> 33:55.494
- I can't do that.
- I've been in hospitals for six months.

33:55.619 --> 33:59.206
All I wanna do is go outside
and breathe some fresh air.

33:59.331 --> 34:03.544
- But you have that thing inside you.
- It's not controlling me.

34:03.627 --> 34:06.630
I'm controlling it. Can't you tell?

34:07.047 --> 34:09.716
Diana, please.

34:09.800 --> 34:12.553
They don't have to kill Major Carter.
I'm fine.

34:12.636 --> 34:16.514
- Everything's gonna be OK.
- I wish I could believe you.

34:16.639 --> 34:18.684
Look at me.

34:19.101 --> 34:22.103
You know me better
than anyone in the whole world.

34:24.106 --> 34:26.190
I did this for you.

34:26.315 --> 34:28.652
So we could be together.

34:29.820 --> 34:33.949
Just let one hand go
so I can touch your face.

35:02.561 --> 35:05.147
What's happening? What are you doing?

35:05.272 --> 35:06.982
What are you doing?

35:08.483 --> 35:10.110
Argh!

35:11.320 --> 35:13.655
You're gonna kill me.

35:13.780 --> 35:16.867
We could be saving millions of lives.

35:16.950 --> 35:18.577
Hold it! Drop it!

35:18.702 --> 35:20.996
Drop it right now! Don't even fool around!

35:21.121 --> 35:23.457
Put it down.

35:23.582 --> 35:25.834
Over here. And face the wall.

35:27.794 --> 35:30.214
You all right?

35:30.339 --> 35:31.715
Yeah.

35:31.798 --> 35:34.468
- Very dramatic. Thank you.
- You bet.

35:34.968 --> 35:37.221
Keys for the cuffs are in his pocket.

35:45.145 --> 35:47.022
Daniel, we got Carter. She's OK.

35:47.648 --> 35:51.109
That's good. I think we have
another problem, though.

36:04.289 --> 36:08.919
They put it in Conrad. They thought
they'd use me to find a way to remove it.

36:09.002 --> 36:11.463
- Good to go?
- Yes, sir.

36:14.258 --> 36:16.134
Um...

36:17.177 --> 36:20.347
- Why not stay and watch these guys?
- That's fine.

36:22.724 --> 36:25.018
You'll be here when I get back, right?

36:25.143 --> 36:27.396
Oh, yes, Jack.

36:40.659 --> 36:43.579
Daniel, Teal'c, take the upper levels.

39:42.841 --> 39:44.885
Where you going?

39:50.140 --> 39:52.684
Shoot me
and you'll kill the host.

39:53.352 --> 39:55.395
Don't make me.

40:05.572 --> 40:07.616
You wanna live,

40:08.534 --> 40:10.410
you come with me.

40:58.208 --> 41:02.421
Man down. O'Neill's been shot. This is
Major Carter. I'm in the boiler room.

41:02.504 --> 41:06.800
Repeat: Colonel O'Neill has been shot.
We need an ambulance now.

41:10.804 --> 41:12.848
Sir, are you OK?

41:14.683 --> 41:16.852
I've been shot, Carter.

41:16.977 --> 41:19.813
I know. Your vest stopped
one of the bullets.

41:19.938 --> 41:22.107
I want sleeves on my vest.

41:22.482 --> 41:25.235
You're gonna be fine. Help's on the way.

41:25.360 --> 41:28.822
I'm not kidding.
They should put sleeves on these things.

41:29.198 --> 41:32.201
- Did you see who shot you?
- No.

41:32.618 --> 41:34.661
Hang in there, sir.

41:38.540 --> 41:41.210
I can't believe the son of a bitch shot me!

41:41.919 --> 41:44.254
We don't know for sure it was Maybourne.

41:44.379 --> 41:47.382
We also don't know how
Maybourne and Adrian Conrad

41:47.466 --> 41:49.801
got by the men surrounding the hospital.

41:49.927 --> 41:53.472
Local authorities have admitted
they may have dropped the ball.

41:53.597 --> 41:55.641
May? May have?

41:55.766 --> 42:00.062
The FBI and Interpol have been alerted,
but we can't tell them everything.

42:00.145 --> 42:03.690
Bottom line is there's
a Goa'uld out there somewhere.

42:24.002 --> 42:28.882
- I expect better treatment.
- Well, right now you have no choice.

42:29.007 --> 42:32.427
But once you start delivering
on your end of our little bargain,

42:32.553 --> 42:35.889
I might be able to move you
to better accommodations.

42:36.014 --> 42:40.769
You cannot offer anything of equal value
to the knowledge I possess.

42:42.145 --> 42:44.439
I'm not so sure about that.
