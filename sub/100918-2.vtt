Stay away from me!

00:41.911 --> 00:42.911
[STRIPE] Courtney.

00:42.911 --> 00:45.048
[Courtney] I mean it, Pat.

00:45.082 --> 00:46.250
I can explain.

00:46.283 --> 00:47.686
[Courtney] So explain.

00:47.719 --> 00:50.188
First, I need to get you
somewhere safe, okay?

00:50.219 --> 00:52.771
[STRIPE whirring]

Come on, you hunk of junk.

01:22.718 --> 01:26.352
Is this thing even safe?

01:39.135 --> 01:40.787
Oh, my God!

02:16.205 --> 02:18.907
Come on, Stripesy.

Stop!

03:03.052 --> 03:07.854
I... I just need
a minute, okay?

03:08.224 --> 03:10.526
I'm upset, too. Just...

03:10.562 --> 03:15.062
Just give me a minute, please.

03:21.139 --> 03:24.342
Are you okay?

03:24.373 --> 03:26.943
No, I'm not okay.

03:26.978 --> 03:29.044
What is that thing?

03:29.080 --> 03:30.580
It's a prototype.

03:30.615 --> 03:33.849
I built it
after Sylvester died.

03:33.883 --> 03:35.853
You built it?

03:35.884 --> 03:39.034
Out of old car parts.

03:42.026 --> 03:44.895
What did your
attacker look like?

03:44.927 --> 03:47.163
I don't know. Creepy.

03:47.198 --> 03:50.568
-Red hair.
-[water running]

03:50.600 --> 03:53.969
He threw tires at me
with his eyes.

03:54.003 --> 03:57.153
It was with his mind.

04:00.377 --> 04:02.176
[softly] Ow.

04:07.651 --> 04:09.252
He fought my dad, didn't he?

04:09.287 --> 04:10.788
Would you stop with that?

04:10.819 --> 04:12.254
Who is he?

04:12.288 --> 04:13.591
He's called Brainwave.

04:13.623 --> 04:15.526
One of the
Justice Society's enemies.

04:15.558 --> 04:18.262
A member of the
Injustice Society of America.

04:18.295 --> 04:20.596
The Injustice Society
of America?

04:20.632 --> 04:23.065
None of you were good
with names, huh, Stripesy?

04:23.098 --> 04:24.668
It was a different time then,

04:24.668 --> 04:29.271
-and look, the less you know--
-I want to know
who Brainwave is.

04:29.305 --> 04:32.942
I'm trying to protect you.

04:32.975 --> 04:37.048
Did he kill my dad?

04:37.079 --> 04:38.848
Starman wasn't your dad,

04:38.882 --> 04:42.685
and Brainwave killed
a lot of my friends that night.

04:42.721 --> 04:45.988
Johnny Thunder,
Hawkman, Hawkgirl.

04:46.021 --> 04:48.225
So, who killed Starman?

04:48.257 --> 04:52.995
[Pat] Their leader. Icicle.

04:53.028 --> 04:55.197
Where is he?

04:55.233 --> 04:59.569
I don't know.

04:59.603 --> 05:00.737
Well, I bet Brainwave does.

05:00.771 --> 05:03.740
-Hey, hold on a sec.
-No, you hold on.

05:03.774 --> 05:05.276
There's no way
it's a coincidence

05:05.276 --> 05:08.644
this psychopath is in
the same small town
that you are.

05:08.678 --> 05:09.879
No more secrets, no more lies.

-[William] What?

05:45.314 --> 05:49.418
I heard them come in.

05:49.452 --> 05:50.553
Stay here with your mother.

05:50.586 --> 05:52.088
William? What is it?

05:52.122 --> 05:55.992
It's the cat, I'm sure.

05:56.024 --> 05:57.360
Dad?

05:57.394 --> 06:01.564
Hey. There's nothing
to worry about.

06:01.598 --> 06:03.800
This is Blue Valley.

I could've killed you.

07:25.581 --> 07:29.331
Why are you wearing that?

07:31.521 --> 07:33.757
We have a problem, William.

07:33.790 --> 07:37.795
It couldn't wait until morning?

07:37.827 --> 07:42.327
This girl has Starman's staff.

07:45.502 --> 07:49.271
Where did she get it?

07:49.305 --> 07:50.740
[clicks tongue] I don't know.

07:50.774 --> 07:52.576
You need to alert the others.

07:52.608 --> 07:54.478
-Tell them to be prepared.
-No.

07:54.478 --> 07:57.346
Not until we know
exactly what's going on.

07:57.346 --> 08:00.317
I called Jordan.

08:00.350 --> 08:05.322
He left me in charge.
Now, why wouldn't you
come to me first?

08:05.355 --> 08:06.990

<i>how you think.</i>

08:07.024 --> 08:12.024
<i>You're ready to take</i>
<i>your family and run.</i>

I'll warn you once.

08:15.399 --> 08:18.002
Stay out of my head, Henry.

08:18.036 --> 08:23.136
I understand
your concern, William. I do.

08:25.675 --> 08:27.978
But the work we're doing
here in Blue Valley

08:28.012 --> 08:32.381
is the perfect test case
for Jordan's grand plan.

08:32.414 --> 08:34.052
It's far too important to us.

08:34.052 --> 08:37.388
To our families
and to their futures,

08:37.419 --> 08:39.389
to abandon.

08:39.423 --> 08:43.626
Project: New America
is our purpose.

08:43.659 --> 08:46.129
Our legacy.

08:46.129 --> 08:50.000
It's what we're doing here.

08:50.033 --> 08:52.470
Isn't it?

08:52.501 --> 08:53.571
[gulps]

08:53.602 --> 08:58.240
Of course.

08:58.274 --> 09:00.879
I'm going to locate this girl.

09:00.910 --> 09:04.780
I'm going to find out
what she knows...

09:04.816 --> 09:09.466
And then
I'm going to kill her.

09:14.692 --> 09:16.640
[door closes]

09:21.664 --> 09:26.001
[whispers] William, who were
you talking to?

09:26.034 --> 09:28.105
No one.

09:28.139 --> 09:30.975
-But I heard--
-Go back upstairs, Denise.

09:31.009 --> 09:35.658
This is my business, not yours.

[Courtney] I want
the whole truth, Pat.

10:02.038 --> 10:03.908
I'm telling you
everything, okay?

10:03.942 --> 10:06.778
Right now. Geez. [exhales]

10:06.809 --> 10:08.245
A teammate of Starman's,

10:08.278 --> 10:11.981
a member of the Justice
Society of America
called Hourman.

10:12.015 --> 10:13.451
I thought you
said they all died.

10:13.482 --> 10:14.884
Can I just get through this?

10:14.918 --> 10:17.889
It's not easy
for me either, you know?

10:17.922 --> 10:19.624
Hourman survived that night

10:19.655 --> 10:21.091
and he took it upon himself

10:21.125 --> 10:23.961
to follow
the Injustice Society's
trail across the country,

10:23.961 --> 10:27.063
from Los Angeles
to Colorado to Nebraska.

10:27.096 --> 10:30.701
He and his wife
died in an accident
shortly after they got here.

10:30.735 --> 10:33.269
Two years ago
I followed Rex's
research here.

10:33.302 --> 10:34.504
That's when I met your mom.

10:34.538 --> 10:36.005
Why'd he give it to you?

10:36.005 --> 10:37.441
It's not like he had
a lot of options.

10:37.441 --> 10:39.942
I was the only one left.

10:39.975 --> 10:42.047
Mmm.

10:42.078 --> 10:43.346
[Pat] When I got
to Blue Valley,

10:43.346 --> 10:46.918
I couldn't pick up
the Injustice Society's trail.

10:46.951 --> 10:50.754
I thought maybe
they passed through
or even left the country.

10:50.788 --> 10:52.188
I never would've moved us here

10:52.188 --> 10:55.192
if I thought any of them
actually stayed in Blue Valley.

10:55.225 --> 10:59.331
I wouldn't put you or your mom
in danger like that. Or Mike.

10:59.364 --> 11:01.899
If you stopped
looking for them,
why the big robot?

11:01.932 --> 11:03.668
I thought I could help Hourman,

11:03.701 --> 11:04.967
but he wanted to go it alone.

11:05.001 --> 11:06.937
I never used
that robot before tonight.

11:06.971 --> 11:10.072
It was the first time.

11:10.105 --> 11:11.475
Okay.

11:11.509 --> 11:15.913
Brainwave's in this
town somewhere
for whatever reason.

11:15.947 --> 11:17.148
So, let's go find him--

11:17.182 --> 11:19.015
-You're being
careless, all right?
-[scoffs]

11:19.048 --> 11:20.418
Brainwave might not be alone

11:20.451 --> 11:21.784
-and he saw you.
-It was dark.

11:21.817 --> 11:23.888
And he finds out
who you are and comes here?

11:23.922 --> 11:25.456
I don't even want to
think about it.

11:25.490 --> 11:28.192
You know, you might laugh
at those red-and-white
stripes I wore,

11:28.192 --> 11:30.059
but people looked
at those instead of my face.

11:30.095 --> 11:32.327
We had costumes for a reason.

11:32.361 --> 11:34.398
To protect our families.

11:34.432 --> 11:36.933
Costume. Check.

11:36.966 --> 11:38.870
-Probably need a mask, too.
-No.

11:38.903 --> 11:40.202
-Upgrade.
-No costumes.

11:40.235 --> 11:41.837
No, no, I... I get it.

11:41.871 --> 11:43.975
I totally see your point, Pat.

11:44.006 --> 11:46.443
Protect the family.
Superhero rule number one.

11:46.476 --> 11:50.014
Rule number one
is that I'm doing
this without you.

11:50.048 --> 11:52.514
This has to be the reason
the staff lit up

11:52.548 --> 11:54.884
because it knows
the bad guys are here.

11:54.918 --> 11:58.554
This is my chance, Pat,
to do something for my dad.

11:58.587 --> 12:00.125
Starman wasn't your dad

12:00.158 --> 12:03.326
and you're not going to
touch the staff ever again.

12:03.360 --> 12:05.895
You can't do that.

12:05.928 --> 12:07.697
You're 15 years old.

12:07.697 --> 12:09.134
You said you met my dad
when he was 15.

12:09.134 --> 12:11.302
-That was different.
-How?

12:11.302 --> 12:12.302
For a whole lotta reasons

12:12.336 --> 12:15.871
that I don't have
to explain right now, okay?

12:15.905 --> 12:19.241
I'm not going to sit
on the sidelines
like you did, Pat.

12:19.274 --> 12:20.845
Hey.

12:20.876 --> 12:25.826
I'm not sitting
on the sidelines.

13:51.000 --> 13:52.836
Come on, Buddy.

13:52.870 --> 13:54.504
We got a fight
to get ready for.

13:54.538 --> 13:58.442
-You ready? Yeah.

13:58.475 --> 14:01.475

15:23.326 --> 15:24.595
Thank you.

15:24.626 --> 15:25.764
Dad's making breakfast.

15:25.797 --> 15:28.432
It should be ready any minute
because I'm starving.

15:28.466 --> 15:32.601
[Pat] Yeah, coming right up,
little buddy. Just be patient.

15:32.634 --> 15:34.672
-Hey.
-Hi.

15:34.703 --> 15:36.005
Hey.

15:36.038 --> 15:38.076
-Hey.
-Hi.

15:38.107 --> 15:40.845
[gasps] Oh, my God!
What happened?

15:40.876 --> 15:43.346
Oh... I fell down
the basement stairs.

15:43.346 --> 15:44.215
What?

15:44.215 --> 15:45.548
Get them while they're hot.

15:45.581 --> 15:46.716
Who's hungry?

15:46.750 --> 15:48.119
-Huh?
-What happened to you?

15:48.150 --> 15:49.818
[video game beeping]

15:49.852 --> 15:50.922
Oh, I...

15:50.953 --> 15:53.490
Well, I-- I tripped down

15:53.524 --> 15:56.192
those basement stairs.

15:56.225 --> 16:01.225
You both fell down
the basement stairs?

16:01.798 --> 16:03.600
Yeah, there's a bad step.

16:03.634 --> 16:06.568
Yeah, it's a couple
of bad steps down there.

16:06.602 --> 16:07.904
I was able to fix it

16:07.938 --> 16:09.639
and what I did was...
Well, it's kind of
an interesting story.

16:09.673 --> 16:11.875
I re-planed it and then I

16:11.908 --> 16:15.044
-got up under the--
-Pancakes, wow!

16:15.077 --> 16:17.014
Wow, look at these, Mom.

16:17.048 --> 16:18.149
Yeah, they look great.

16:18.182 --> 16:20.417
Would you like blueberry
or chocolate chip?

16:20.417 --> 16:21.384
One of each.

16:21.384 --> 16:23.419
[chuckles]

16:23.453 --> 16:25.489
-You got 'em. One of each.
-[Mike] Okay.

16:25.489 --> 16:26.322
[Pat] Coming up.

16:26.322 --> 16:28.457
You sure you're both okay?

16:28.490 --> 16:30.427
[both] Fine.

16:30.427 --> 16:31.294
Great.

16:31.294 --> 16:34.730
-[both laugh]
-Wow.

16:34.764 --> 16:36.567
Why are you guys
acting so weird?

16:36.600 --> 16:39.903
What are you talking about?
I'm serving breakfast here.

16:39.937 --> 16:42.072
-[video game beeps]
-Dammit!

16:42.105 --> 16:44.240
Mike, language.

16:44.274 --> 16:45.509
What do you want me to say?

16:45.543 --> 16:47.312
Uh, dang it, darn it.

16:47.345 --> 16:49.745
How about a golly gee,
is that too strong?

16:49.778 --> 16:51.149
That's perfect.

16:51.182 --> 16:54.183
[whispers] Thanks for
trying with Pat.

16:54.217 --> 16:56.187
Right, I'll be off
right at 6:00.

16:56.221 --> 16:57.322
[Pat] Sounds great.

16:57.355 --> 16:59.389
-Nice suit.
-Thank you.

16:59.389 --> 17:00.356
-[Pat] Looks nice, huh?
-[door opens]

17:00.356 --> 17:01.692
[Mike] Yeah, it's awesome.

17:01.725 --> 17:03.595
[door closes]

17:03.626 --> 17:05.563
-Where are you going?
-I'm not hungry.

17:05.563 --> 17:06.497
You kidding me?

17:06.497 --> 17:08.999
Prison rules.
Hot damn. [laughs]

17:09.032 --> 17:10.601
-Mike.
-Golly gee.

17:10.633 --> 17:13.170
Great. [sighs]

17:13.203 --> 17:16.953
[footsteps climbing down]

17:59.851 --> 18:03.019
Look, I want some eggs,
all right? Not so runny.

18:03.053 --> 18:07.523
Pronto.

18:07.557 --> 18:11.027
[Dr. King] Henry?

18:11.061 --> 18:12.528
Junior.

18:12.563 --> 18:16.666
Uh... Yeah, Dad?

18:16.699 --> 18:17.749
[sighs]

18:23.207 --> 18:25.242
-Sit down.
-I... I gotta get

18:25.275 --> 18:29.813
-going, Dad.
-Sit.

18:29.846 --> 18:31.196
Yes, sir.

18:36.487 --> 18:41.487
I have a few more questions
about the other night.

18:41.691 --> 18:44.461
What?

18:44.496 --> 18:47.397
Was it a girl that did it?

18:47.431 --> 18:51.335
No, I told you,
it was some guy. [chuckles]

18:51.368 --> 18:55.372
-You really think a girl--
-You can't lie to me, Henry.

18:55.405 --> 18:57.775
I always know. [sniffles]

18:57.807 --> 18:59.976
So...

19:00.010 --> 19:02.710
Tell me, Junior...

19:05.616 --> 19:09.053
Did a girl beat you
and your friends up

19:09.085 --> 19:13.857
and destroy my car?

19:13.890 --> 19:17.827
It was too hard to see.

19:17.861 --> 19:21.431
Maybe it was a girl.

19:21.465 --> 19:26.415
Can you give me
a ride to school?

19:29.306 --> 19:31.474
[clicks tongue]

19:31.507 --> 19:34.044
[inhales]

19:34.077 --> 19:35.428
[exhales]

19:44.255 --> 19:46.223
What am I thinking?

19:46.256 --> 19:48.858
Come on, Dad.

19:48.892 --> 19:50.193
Try and guess.

19:50.227 --> 19:52.962
I hate when you
stare at me like this.

19:52.996 --> 19:54.265
It's weird.

19:54.298 --> 19:57.634
Look me in the eyes
and tell me what I'm thinking.

19:57.667 --> 19:58.717
[sighs]

20:08.945 --> 20:11.815
That I have to take the bus?

20:11.848 --> 20:13.798
I don't know.

20:19.623 --> 20:24.623
I'll drop you off
on the way to the hospital.

20:25.561 --> 20:27.897
Okay.

20:27.931 --> 20:28.832
Henry.

20:38.208 --> 20:40.611
I've told you before.

20:40.644 --> 20:45.215
You don't steal from family.

20:45.248 --> 20:49.286
Yes, sir.

[Sharpe] <i>As CFO here</i>

22:35.893 --> 22:39.028
at The American Dream,
my focus is, of course,

22:39.063 --> 22:40.297
to balance profitability

22:40.330 --> 22:43.601
with our extensive
philanthropic appetite.

22:43.634 --> 22:47.270
As such, the suggestion box for
our next community fundraiser

22:47.304 --> 22:50.005
is open. So speak.

22:52.442 --> 22:57.080
Ideas, folks.

22:57.113 --> 22:58.163
Anyone?

23:03.019 --> 23:04.354
Yes.

23:04.387 --> 23:05.689
Well, Mr. Sharpe,

23:05.722 --> 23:08.391
there are so many
new restaurants in Blue Valley.

23:08.425 --> 23:10.194
I mean, far more
than when I was a kid,

23:10.227 --> 23:12.329
and back in Valley Village,
California, there was

23:12.362 --> 23:14.464
a taste of the town
once a year.

23:14.465 --> 23:15.766
It was a way
for the restaurants

23:15.799 --> 23:17.935
-to introduce themselves
to the commu--
-No.

23:17.968 --> 23:21.738
-But it really helps.
-Everyone in Blue Valley
knows the restaurants already.

23:21.771 --> 23:24.807
Bad idea.

23:24.842 --> 23:27.244
Any others?

23:27.277 --> 23:29.077
[man coughs]

23:35.953 --> 23:38.388
-Yes?
-[Barbara] This may
sound a bit silly,

23:38.422 --> 23:40.657
but the farmers
would do Cow Pie Bingo

23:40.691 --> 23:43.226
to raise money
for the schools
way back when.

23:43.260 --> 23:44.695
They would
raffle off square plots

23:44.728 --> 23:47.063
-in a field and they would--
-It does sound silly

23:47.097 --> 23:49.032
and disgusting.

23:49.065 --> 23:50.734
Any others?

23:50.768 --> 23:55.640
Anyone else with an idea?

23:55.672 --> 23:57.507
Well, no one else?

23:57.541 --> 24:01.741
I'll come up with something.

24:03.747 --> 24:07.751
[indistinct chattering]

24:07.785 --> 24:11.685
Mr. Sharpe can be...tough.

-[grunts]

24:33.410 --> 24:34.711
Pat, Pat.

24:34.746 --> 24:36.747
Come on, man, don't bring
this stuff in here.

24:36.780 --> 24:39.150
What are you thinking?

24:39.182 --> 24:41.251
-Come on.
-Hey, Larry.

24:41.284 --> 24:43.020
-Ah.
-Sorry. Uh...

24:43.053 --> 24:46.256
-Cru... Crusher.
-Crusher! That's right, buddy.

24:46.289 --> 24:47.991
-How you doing, Pat?
-Pretty good.

24:48.025 --> 24:49.192
You don't look good.

24:49.226 --> 24:50.361
-Okay.
-At all.

24:50.393 --> 24:51.561
-All right.
-What's going on?

24:51.595 --> 24:53.297
Well, funny you should ask,

24:53.332 --> 24:55.632
I've actually been thinking
about maybe getting on

24:55.666 --> 24:58.702
a cardiovascular wellness
type program

24:58.703 --> 24:59.769
that I've been reading about.

24:59.770 --> 25:01.005
No idea what
you're talking about.

25:01.005 --> 25:02.673
Okay, well...

25:02.707 --> 25:05.442
Yeah, like, you call it,
"Getting ripped."

25:05.442 --> 25:06.510
-A little louder.
-Ripped, right?

25:06.510 --> 25:07.811
-Ripped!
-Yeah.

25:07.845 --> 25:09.413
Don't be ashamed to say ripped.

25:09.448 --> 25:11.349
-That's what we
do here, buddy. Let's go!
-Okay, I just want to...

25:11.382 --> 25:13.150
-Grab some clothes
off the rack...
-...sign up today and maybe

25:13.184 --> 25:14.818
-get started next week...
-Go back there,
get changed, come out.

25:14.852 --> 25:16.553
-We're getting started
right now. Let's go.
-Okay.

25:16.553 --> 25:18.021
-We're starting right now.
-Yeah, okay.

25:18.021 --> 25:19.122
Yeah, come on, baby!

25:19.155 --> 25:20.657
Get pumped!

25:20.691 --> 25:24.161
This is Crusher's house.

25:24.195 --> 25:28.298
Dad used to tell me,
"You gotta want pain.

25:28.332 --> 25:31.068
You gotta make
pain your friend."

25:31.101 --> 25:33.637
You're making choices
for your future self right now.

25:33.670 --> 25:34.838
Your better self.

25:34.872 --> 25:38.208
Your better self
is gonna thank you for it.

25:38.241 --> 25:40.678
How long have we
been doing this?

25:40.711 --> 25:41.712
Three minutes.

25:41.746 --> 25:46.516
Only 57 more to go.

25:46.550 --> 25:47.751
There you go.

25:47.784 --> 25:52.784
[children chattering

26:04.801 --> 26:06.737
I love having lunch together.

26:06.770 --> 26:10.207
<i>Yeah, the chicken cordon bleu</i>
<i>is delicious, honey,</i>

26:10.240 --> 26:11.808
<i>but it's a little heavy</i>

26:11.842 --> 26:13.176
for this time of day.

-Hey, hon. [chuckles]

26:30.361 --> 26:31.994
-Dr. Chapel.
-Mmm.

<i>Hello, Henry.</i>

[Dr. Chapel] <i>Honey, who's</i>
<i>that with you?</i>

26:39.938 --> 26:42.073
<i>Oh, that's Courtney.</i>

26:42.106 --> 26:45.141
Well, why don't you
have lunch with her?

26:45.175 --> 26:46.544
[James] <i>Yeah, have lunch</i>

26:46.576 --> 26:48.178
<i>with your friend, Beth, okay?</i>

26:48.211 --> 26:52.450
[chuckles] <i>Mmm.</i>

26:52.483 --> 26:55.053
[Dr. Chapel] Your father and I
have to get back to work.

26:55.085 --> 26:56.854
We'll see you at
the open house tonight.

26:56.887 --> 26:58.856
You'll see everyone
at the open house tonight.

26:58.890 --> 27:01.491
It's gonna be a party!

27:01.525 --> 27:04.728
<i>Love you, Mom.</i>

27:04.761 --> 27:06.230
Open house?

27:06.263 --> 27:09.633
Yes, I assume
you and Henry will be there?

27:09.666 --> 27:12.371
Oh, we wouldn't miss it.

27:14.337 --> 27:17.938
My parents are the best.

27:21.912 --> 27:25.962
Can you stop staring at me?

27:27.551 --> 27:30.186
I wasn't...

night of the year

27:43.067 --> 27:45.002
These boys and girls of yours

I am proud to announce
last year's graduating class

27:58.515 --> 28:01.518
was in the top 1%
of the nation.

28:10.627 --> 28:12.662

28:12.696 --> 28:14.398
that made that possible.

28:14.432 --> 28:17.268
Councilman Zarick,
for his undying commitment

28:17.301 --> 28:22.301
to making sure
our school receives
the funding it needs.

and Bridget Chapel

28:30.647 --> 28:35.553
of the Blue Valley
Medical Center...

...for their generous
volunteer work

Go Prairie Dogs!

28:40.690 --> 28:42.525
[audience laugh and murmur]

28:42.559 --> 28:43.994
Go Dogs,

28:44.027 --> 28:46.263
and, finally, everyone employed

28:46.297 --> 28:49.967
by The American Dream,
by Blue Valley Tires.

28:50.000 --> 28:52.402
The lifeline of this town.

28:52.435 --> 28:54.986
Please, stand up.

Everyone give a hand

29:01.145 --> 29:04.748
to the backbone
of this great community.

[indistinct chattering]

29:13.490 --> 29:15.224
We never come to these things.

29:15.258 --> 29:18.496
Why are we here?

29:18.528 --> 29:23.233
Go get some punch, Henry.

29:23.267 --> 29:28.267
[Dr. King reading
people's thoughts]

29:35.813 --> 29:38.813
[indistinct chatter]

29:42.886 --> 29:44.087
[Beth] It's going to
be amazing.

29:44.087 --> 29:46.457
I can't wait
for you to meet Mrs. Rizamy.

29:46.489 --> 29:47.891
No, Mr. Mora.

29:47.924 --> 29:52.896
He's the best
biochemistry teacher ever.

29:52.929 --> 29:54.297
-Hey.
-[grunts]

29:54.330 --> 29:55.565
Me again.

29:55.599 --> 29:57.467
These are not on the program.

29:57.500 --> 29:58.936
Program? What program?

29:58.969 --> 30:01.638
The program that you
started today, big guy.

30:01.671 --> 30:03.874
I call it Pat 2.0.

30:03.907 --> 30:06.309
This stuff

30:06.342 --> 30:08.445
will kill you.

30:08.478 --> 30:10.747
You gotta be kidding me.

30:10.781 --> 30:13.718
This guy is crazy.

30:13.751 --> 30:17.455
History and tradition
are undervalued
in favor of progress,

30:17.488 --> 30:20.224
but passing our ways
onto the next generation

30:20.257 --> 30:23.127
for them to then improve
upon in their own way.

30:23.160 --> 30:24.628
That's what life's about.

30:24.661 --> 30:25.996
Legacy.

30:26.029 --> 30:28.999
My boy here is quite
the musician himself.

30:29.032 --> 30:30.467
He'll be better
than I ever was.

30:30.500 --> 30:31.635
A real savant,

30:31.669 --> 30:34.905
-and a cute one at that.
-Mom.

30:34.938 --> 30:38.838
My sweet boy is so modest.

30:41.044 --> 30:43.313
[Courtney] Pat. Psst.

30:43.346 --> 30:44.481
Hey, Pat.

30:44.515 --> 30:45.682
What are you doing?

30:45.715 --> 30:47.117
I'm trying to hydrate.

30:47.151 --> 30:48.419
Have you seen anything?

30:48.452 --> 30:51.755
Parents, their kids, teachers,
a lot of cookies,

30:51.788 --> 30:55.058
and stop looking for Brainwave.
I got it.

30:55.092 --> 30:56.693
We can cover
more ground together.

30:56.726 --> 30:57.996
You keep checking out the gym,

30:57.996 --> 30:59.497
-I'll head to the classrooms.
-Hey, listen to me.

30:59.497 --> 31:00.664
-Court, listen to me.
-Meet back at
the cookies in ten.

31:00.665 --> 31:01.932
Hey, hold on a sec.
You're not--

31:01.932 --> 31:03.566
-Stop standing around.
-Hey, stop--

31:03.601 --> 31:04.868
Hey, move, Patrick.

31:04.901 --> 31:08.951
Stop telling me what to do.

31:14.044 --> 31:15.345
-Oh.
-I'm... I'm sorry.

31:15.345 --> 31:16.212
My fault.

31:16.212 --> 31:17.080
-[laughs]
-Excuse me.

31:17.080 --> 31:18.882
No, it's me. I...

31:18.915 --> 31:21.018
Hi, I'm Denise Zarick.

31:21.051 --> 31:22.853
Pat Dugan. Hi.

31:22.886 --> 31:24.921
-You're new to Blue Valley.
-Yeah.

31:24.955 --> 31:26.823
Me and my family
just moved here.

31:26.857 --> 31:28.058
-You?
-Oh, no.

31:28.092 --> 31:30.627
No, I've been here a long time.

31:30.660 --> 31:32.630
-Mmm, it's seems nice.
-Yeah.

31:32.662 --> 31:35.565
People think so.

31:35.598 --> 31:36.667
Oh, I, uh...

31:36.701 --> 31:39.136
I have to go. It was really
nice meeting you, Pat.

31:39.169 --> 31:40.670
Denise, nice to meet you.

31:40.704 --> 31:43.104
-Bye.
-You, too.

31:59.156 --> 32:01.058
They say my daughter
will be the first woman

32:01.059 --> 32:02.325
-drafted into the NFL.
-Oh, my.

32:02.325 --> 32:03.227
You say it, Mom.

32:03.227 --> 32:05.229
-Your father does, too.
-It's true.

32:05.262 --> 32:07.097
[Crusher] I'm a bragger
with this one.

32:07.130 --> 32:10.834
[Courtney thinking] <i>Brainwave.</i>

32:10.867 --> 32:13.505
Excuse me.

32:13.537 --> 32:18.537
[Crusher] You know what
they say, it's not bragging
if it's true.

32:21.246 --> 32:23.313
Your teachers seem
incredibly well-educated.

32:23.347 --> 32:28.297
I told you, Mom,
to stop talking.

32:29.652 --> 32:34.257
Pat?

32:34.290 --> 32:37.194
Pat?

[indistinct chatter]

32:52.876 --> 32:56.326
[chatting indistinctly]

33:00.050 --> 33:02.000
So, it's you.

33:05.722 --> 33:10.060
Hello. Courtney.

33:10.093 --> 33:14.265
Stay away from me.

33:14.298 --> 33:16.332
You're Starman's daughter,

33:16.366 --> 33:19.069
is that it?

33:19.102 --> 33:21.938
You keep thinking
of him over and over.

33:21.972 --> 33:24.007
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

33:24.041 --> 33:27.044
Yes, you do.

33:27.077 --> 33:31.428
[students chatting, laughing]

33:35.619 --> 33:37.921
You'll pay for what
you did to my dad

33:37.954 --> 33:40.924
and the JSA.

33:40.924 --> 33:43.624
You're frightened.

33:46.497 --> 33:50.467
Your father was frightened,
too,

33:50.500 --> 33:54.338
of so many things.

33:54.371 --> 33:57.409
You're going to bring
me the Cosmic Staff.

33:57.441 --> 34:01.544
You're going to come back
here with it at midnight.

34:38.414 --> 34:39.414
Hmm.

34:47.925 --> 34:49.626
Pat. He's here.

34:49.659 --> 34:50.661
Brainwave? Where?

34:50.663 --> 34:52.396
He knows who my mom is
and he said he'd kill her

34:52.396 --> 34:54.164
if I didn't meet him
back here at midnight
with the staff.

34:54.197 --> 34:55.400
What? Where is he?

34:55.431 --> 35:00.431
-I... I don't know. He--
-Okay, hold on.

35:02.106 --> 35:03.106
Wait right here.

35:03.106 --> 35:04.074
All right?

35:04.074 --> 35:08.512
-Wait right here.
-But, Pat.

35:08.545 --> 35:11.782
Excuse me.
Barbara, I'm very sorry,

35:11.782 --> 35:12.784
but we gotta go.

35:12.784 --> 35:14.684
Pat, no, no,
I'm talking to these people.

35:14.717 --> 35:17.155
Yeah, I'm... [stuttering]

35:17.188 --> 35:20.358
Well, I'm really
not feeling so hot.

35:20.389 --> 35:22.260
I had some of those

35:22.293 --> 35:23.960
pigs in a blanket over there

35:23.994 --> 35:25.027
and can we hit it?

35:25.061 --> 35:26.795
-Oh, yeah.
-Yeah.

35:26.831 --> 35:29.065
-So, Principal, Senator.
-Mmm.

35:29.067 --> 35:30.266
-Nice talking to you.
-Councilman.

35:30.266 --> 35:33.469
-Bye, guys. Bye.
-Bye.

35:33.503 --> 35:36.139
Hmm.

35:36.172 --> 35:38.007
Um...

35:38.041 --> 35:39.541
No thanks.

35:50.920 --> 35:53.291
[Pat] Hey.

35:53.322 --> 35:54.858
What are you doing?

35:54.891 --> 35:56.025
I have to face him.

35:56.059 --> 35:57.793
He's going to hurt
my mom if I don't.

35:57.827 --> 36:00.297
No. All right?

36:00.331 --> 36:01.465
You're staying here.

36:01.498 --> 36:03.132
He said he'd give her a stroke.

36:03.166 --> 36:04.967
He'd make her death painful.

36:05.001 --> 36:06.601
When he says that,

36:06.603 --> 36:07.905
he's not lying,

36:07.905 --> 36:09.273
and he'll do it to you, too.

36:09.306 --> 36:10.806
Stop trying to scare me.

36:10.840 --> 36:13.275
You should be scared.

36:13.275 --> 36:14.411
You understand me?

36:14.445 --> 36:17.882
Well, I can't be right now.

36:17.916 --> 36:21.251
Pat, my whole life I've waited
for my father to show up

36:21.284 --> 36:23.655
and now I know why he didn't.

36:23.688 --> 36:25.755
Brainwave and the others
took him from me,

36:25.757 --> 36:27.224
and this staff
is giving me a chance

36:27.257 --> 36:29.760
to get justice for that.

36:29.793 --> 36:34.793
For my dad.
For the JSA. For--
For your friends.

36:35.331 --> 36:38.101
I don't care
that that staff
works for you.

36:38.135 --> 36:40.271
-[sighs]
-You're staying here.

36:40.304 --> 36:42.853
You listen to me.

36:46.208 --> 36:48.646
If I'm not back in the morning,

36:48.677 --> 36:50.014
you get your mom

36:50.045 --> 36:52.818
and Mike and you
leave Blue Valley.

36:52.851 --> 36:56.552
You leave and you
never, ever look back.

36:56.588 --> 37:01.588
-Pat, you don't--
-Do you understand
what I'm saying to you? Stop.

37:02.226 --> 37:07.226
You protect your mom.
You get her out of here.

37:11.835 --> 37:14.835
Tell her I love her.

-Hi. No.

38:34.818 --> 38:36.853
You getting along
with Pat today

38:36.853 --> 38:39.356
didn't go unnoticed.

38:39.389 --> 38:41.559
I know this has been difficult.

38:41.592 --> 38:45.563
The move and a new stepfather
and new stepbrother and...

38:45.597 --> 38:48.831
-And instant family...
-[both chuckle]

38:48.867 --> 38:51.135
I thought it'd all
be so perfect.

38:51.135 --> 38:55.974
It's okay.

38:56.005 --> 39:00.177
I am grateful for everything
that you've been doing.

39:00.210 --> 39:02.545
I wanted you to know.

39:02.579 --> 39:04.681
Everything's not been as easy

39:04.715 --> 39:08.016
as I imagined it would be
transitioning here.

39:08.052 --> 39:09.518
I know that,

39:09.518 --> 39:12.422
but we're going to
make a good life.

39:12.456 --> 39:16.293

-That's all I want for you.

the greatest thing

39:22.467 --> 39:26.235

39:26.268 --> 39:28.170
Thanks, Mom.

[sobs and sniffles]

39:30.576 --> 39:31.708
We're gonna figure this out.

39:31.708 --> 39:34.677
-[laughs] Yeah.
-[laughs]

39:34.710 --> 39:39.710
-All right. Goodnight.
-Goodnight.

What do we do with him?

45:10.347 --> 45:12.581
We found him outside.

45:12.617 --> 45:14.052
From what we can gather,

45:14.083 --> 45:17.387
your father suffered
a seizure of some sort.

45:17.420 --> 45:19.224
We're doing everything we can

45:19.255 --> 45:23.260

to help him...

for them, too.

the staff works for you.

maybe you
are Sylvester's daughter,

46:47.811 --> 46:50.880
as crazy as that might be.

46:50.914 --> 46:52.983
But whatever the case,

46:53.016 --> 46:54.619
you're the one
who didn't give up.

46:54.650 --> 46:56.454
You're the one who saved me

I was a sidekick
my partner got killed.

Yes, but... This time
you have a freaking robot.

47:18.876 --> 47:22.612
You can do this, Pat.

47:22.646 --> 47:25.681
The staff chose me...
