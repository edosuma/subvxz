16:27.220 --> 16:28.453
Sorry for your loss.

16:29.656 --> 16:30.655
Got my money?

16:32.258 --> 16:33.224
Yeah.

16:49.309 --> 16:50.274
Sixty more.

16:51.478 --> 16:52.710
We agreed on 500.

16:53.646 --> 16:55.646
You'll get it back,
it's just a precaution

16:55.648 --> 16:57.115
in case you make a mess.

17:05.792 --> 17:07.058
Can I just Venmo you?

17:08.294 --> 17:09.260
Venmo?

17:11.331 --> 17:12.330
Never mind.

17:23.543 --> 17:25.777
Well, don't hesitate to call me
if you need anything.

17:27.147 --> 17:28.312
I'm just down the road.

17:29.416 --> 17:30.415
Okay.

17:34.087 --> 17:35.520
[keys jingling]

18:05.185 --> 18:08.419
-[Agnes] Who are you?
-Uh, I--

18:08.788 --> 18:10.588
I'm renting the house
this weekend.

18:12.325 --> 18:13.257
Renting.

18:13.259 --> 18:16.260
Yeah, it--
It was super last-minute.

18:25.705 --> 18:28.573
Agnes, friend of the family.

18:30.310 --> 18:31.275
Olive.

18:32.512 --> 18:34.245
Feel like a fish
out of water in here.

18:34.747 --> 18:36.848
Oh, you'll do just fine.

18:44.491 --> 18:45.823
It's nice to meet you.

18:49.863 --> 18:51.696
Try not to make a mess, dear.

18:52.365 --> 18:53.898
-Okay?
-Yeah.

18:57.670 --> 18:58.703
[spits]

19:19.425 --> 19:21.726

19:21.928 --> 19:24.462
-[knocking on door]
-[sighs]

19:25.665 --> 19:28.199
You didn't tell me,
you were expecting a guest.

19:29.302 --> 19:30.268
Poor girl.

19:30.270 --> 19:32.770
Must've frightened her
half to death.

19:33.740 --> 19:35.873
Why were you over there
in the first place?

19:37.710 --> 19:40.211
Plants don't water themselves,
Harvey.

19:42.949 --> 19:45.383
Just exactly
what are you up to?

19:46.553 --> 19:48.619
You're the only real friend
I got left in this world.

19:51.691 --> 19:53.858
Which is why
this is so difficult.

20:04.437 --> 20:05.636
[sighs]

20:12.845 --> 20:14.812
You know, whenever I go
swimming, I have deja vu.

20:15.348 --> 20:16.714
-Swimming? How so?
-Yeah.

20:16.716 --> 20:18.849
If I touch water,
it's like I'm there again

20:18.851 --> 20:20.451
-where I was before.
-[phone ringing]

20:20.453 --> 20:21.652
I'm sorry.
Hey, Crystal,

20:21.654 --> 20:23.454
free yourself
from that electronic leash.

20:23.456 --> 20:24.522
Fuck off, Uriah.

20:26.593 --> 20:27.525
Hey, sweetie.

20:28.294 --> 20:29.260
Hey, Mom.

20:29.262 --> 20:33.364
Uh, you're not gonna believe it,
but I took your advice

20:33.366 --> 20:35.666
and high-tailed it
out of the city for the weekend.

20:36.002 --> 20:38.402
Oh, that's wonderful news,
honey.

20:38.938 --> 20:40.905
My little girl roughing it
in nature.

20:41.341 --> 20:43.341
Don't get too excited,
I'm calling you

20:43.343 --> 20:45.409
from a piano bench
in Piru.

20:45.878 --> 20:50.448
By your standards,
this place is bougie as fuck.

20:50.917 --> 20:53.618
Put your phone on speaker
and let me hear you play.

20:53.620 --> 20:55.553
[Olive]<i> Mom,</i>
<i> you missed all of my recitals.</i>

20:55.555 --> 20:56.854
It was a rough time.

20:57.023 --> 20:59.323
-For both of us.
-[Crystal]<i> I'm here now.</i>

20:59.459 --> 21:01.626
-Via telephone.
-Oh, enough.

21:01.628 --> 21:03.361
Just play the goddamn piano.

21:03.496 --> 21:04.428
Fine.

21:08.968 --> 21:10.268
[exhales]

21:15.608 --> 21:17.908
[piano playing]

21:33.826 --> 21:35.826
[Edith]<i> Harvey, Harvey.</i>

21:35.828 --> 21:37.328
<i> Harvey. Harvey.</i>

21:37.597 --> 21:38.663
<i> Harvey. Harvey!</i>

21:42.802 --> 21:44.468
[piano playing]

21:46.539 --> 21:47.605
[Olive]<i> What'd you think?</i>

21:51.311 --> 21:52.677
Mom? Did I lose you?

21:53.513 --> 21:56.814
No, no, I'm here. I'm here.
That was, um...

21:58.084 --> 21:59.917
That was wonderful.

22:00.553 --> 22:02.820
Listen, I'm gonna text you
the address.

22:02.822 --> 22:04.822
If you call and I don't pick up,

22:04.824 --> 22:07.892
I'm being objectified
and tortured by a hillbilly.

22:13.066 --> 22:14.632
-[phone beeps]
-Boy...

22:20.973 --> 22:21.956
it's your father.

22:21.957 --> 22:22.940
I'm sorry I yelled at you
the other day.

22:22.942 --> 22:25.576
I-- I know you don't like
voicemails,

22:25.578 --> 22:27.044
but since you're not answering
your phone,

22:27.046 --> 22:28.979
you're not leaving me
any other choice.

22:32.552 --> 22:33.718
I hope you're good on money.

23:11.057 --> 23:13.057
[panting]

23:16.629 --> 23:19.764
I don't understand, Harvey.
What's going on?

23:21.968 --> 23:23.701
This was never part of the plan.

23:25.037 --> 23:26.504
What plan?

23:26.505 --> 23:27.972
What the hell
are you talking about?

23:28.674 --> 23:30.441
My boy thinks
I'm losing my mind.

23:30.443 --> 23:31.709
He thinks I have dementia.

23:32.078 --> 23:34.044
But I'm as fit
as a goddamn fiddle.

23:35.014 --> 23:36.981
He wants to put me
in a nursing home.

23:37.183 --> 23:39.450
He calls it
an assisted living center.

23:40.086 --> 23:41.602
But we both know that

23:41.603 --> 23:43.119
that's just putting lipstick
on a pig.

23:47.527 --> 23:48.826
I've lived a good life.

23:53.800 --> 23:55.833
[sighs] Traveled the world...

23:57.670 --> 24:00.504
contributed to the community,
I've known true love.

24:01.674 --> 24:03.574
I've done it all,
except for one thing.

24:05.611 --> 24:07.678
I don't know how it feels
to kill someone.

24:10.049 --> 24:12.516
That's an itch I never
got around to scratching.

24:12.885 --> 24:14.885
[screams]

24:17.557 --> 24:20.090
Shh, calm down.

24:20.493 --> 24:21.826
Calm down.

24:24.130 --> 24:25.696
I'm not gonna kill you yet.

24:27.133 --> 24:28.966
The thought of it
breaks my heart.

24:38.845 --> 24:39.944
I'm gonna go get that...

24:41.614 --> 24:44.715
young lady.
I'm gonna take care of her,

24:44.717 --> 24:46.150
and then I'm gonna come back
for you.

24:48.588 --> 24:51.021
You've been such a good friend
to the family over the years.

24:57.263 --> 24:59.597
I'm gonna make sure
this is painless as possible,

24:59.599 --> 25:00.631
I give you my word.

25:16.849 --> 25:18.215
[keys jangling]

26:03.930 --> 26:07.031
[Edith]<i> Harvey, don't you do it.</i>

26:07.867 --> 26:09.333
[high-pitched ringing]

27:44.930 --> 27:45.963
Yeah, no shit.

29:20.392 --> 29:21.458
[crickets chirping]

29:21.794 --> 29:22.860
[knocks on door]

29:28.167 --> 29:30.200
[Crystal] Hmm,
and what do you want?

29:30.369 --> 29:31.368
[Uriah] Can I speak with you?

29:33.105 --> 29:34.071
[Crystal] Okay.

29:39.478 --> 29:40.944
[Uriah] Okay, so...

29:43.983 --> 29:46.416
Crystal, I came here
with an open heart

29:46.952 --> 29:50.320
and an open mind
to express my feelings for you.

29:51.257 --> 29:56.527
You are powerful, confident
and a deeply sexual force,

29:57.163 --> 29:59.263
that has drawn me in.

30:00.299 --> 30:01.965
And I know we have chemistry,

30:02.434 --> 30:04.868
but you continue
to resist my advances.

30:05.271 --> 30:06.236
Why?

30:08.207 --> 30:09.173
You are cute.

30:10.176 --> 30:11.441
There's no way around that.

30:13.479 --> 30:14.912
But you're also
kind of a douche.

30:14.914 --> 30:18.448
Uh, if I were to work
on de-douchifying myself,

30:18.450 --> 30:19.516
would you consider me then?

30:25.424 --> 30:26.523
-Oh, my god.
-[Crystal] Oh, yeah.

30:26.525 --> 30:28.003
-I've been wa-- Yeah, I'm ready.
-Come here. Come here.

30:28.004 --> 30:29.482
-There you go.
-[Uriah] Okay.

30:29.483 --> 30:30.961
[chuckles]
Atta boy.

30:36.335 --> 30:37.835
-Well...
-[Uriah] Mm-hmm.

30:37.837 --> 30:39.403
There you go, there you go.

30:39.872 --> 30:40.871
[phone beeps]

30:43.075 --> 30:44.208
[Uriah] How's that?

30:44.209 --> 30:45.342
Wait,
is that your fuckin' phone?

30:45.344 --> 30:46.476
Shh. It's okay, shh, shh.

30:46.478 --> 30:47.544
-Shh. Shh.
-That's your phone.

30:47.546 --> 30:49.546
-Can we just--
-It's all good, you're good.

30:49.915 --> 30:51.281

-[door opens]
-[Harvey sighs]

31:20.913 --> 31:24.281
It didn't go as planned.
I got a case of the jitters.

31:24.650 --> 31:25.916
Can you believe that?

31:26.452 --> 31:28.285
Me? With a case of the jitters.

31:31.190 --> 31:32.389
Who am I kidding?

31:32.391 --> 31:35.058
We both know no one can hear us.
[chuckles]

31:37.496 --> 31:38.595
I gotta tell ya,

31:39.965 --> 31:43.100
turning a dream into a reality
is no easy task.

31:44.270 --> 31:48.005
-Especially when it's murder.
-Can you think about Edith?

31:49.074 --> 31:51.508
Imagine what she'd say.
[sobs]

31:52.211 --> 31:53.577
Why dwell in the past?

31:54.580 --> 31:56.413
Good old days are over
and done with.

31:58.684 --> 32:00.918
You ever stop
to think it wasn't so good

32:00.920 --> 32:02.019
for the rest of us?

32:03.923 --> 32:07.157
We both know you had her trapped
in that marriage,

32:07.159 --> 32:09.026
holding custody over her head.

32:09.028 --> 32:11.395
So don't you go
rewriting history,

32:12.031 --> 32:13.697
like it was all peaches
and cream.

32:13.699 --> 32:15.666
She suffered
from clinical depression.

32:16.001 --> 32:17.100
You should've seen her.

32:17.469 --> 32:19.002
[screams]

32:20.639 --> 32:22.406
She couldn't raise that boy
on her own.

32:23.409 --> 32:26.243
The burden fell on me.
Show some goddamn compassion.

32:26.245 --> 32:28.578
Oh, Harvey, get over yourself.

32:29.048 --> 32:32.549
The only good you ever had
in you was because of her.

32:32.551 --> 32:33.617
Suppose so!

32:36.055 --> 32:38.288
[Agnes screams and groans]

32:40.059 --> 32:41.491
Jesus Christ.

32:43.329 --> 32:45.062
I didn't really think
this through.

32:45.064 --> 32:47.130
[Agnes screams]

32:52.738 --> 32:54.638
[panting]

32:59.311 --> 33:01.178
You really hurt my feelings,
Agnes.

33:02.448 --> 33:03.981
You really hurt my feelings.

33:28.774 --> 33:30.107
[phone beeps]

33:36.782 --> 33:37.781
[screams]

33:37.783 --> 33:40.050
-God damn it.
-Who are you?

33:40.419 --> 33:41.451
Who are you?

33:41.453 --> 33:43.720
I'm renting the house
for the weekend.

33:46.425 --> 33:48.792
Crazy old man should not be
making decisions like that

33:48.794 --> 33:50.360
without consulting me first.

33:52.631 --> 33:56.133
Forgive me. [chuckles]
I didn't mean to frighten you.

33:56.468 --> 33:58.702
I'm David. I'm Harvey's son.

33:59.671 --> 34:01.371
-Olive.
-Pleasure.

34:03.242 --> 34:04.341
I'll be gone in a minute.

34:04.343 --> 34:06.443
I just gotta get some prototypes
out of the attic.

34:08.213 --> 34:10.447
I'm sending my latest
and greatest to the<i> Shark Tank.</i>

34:10.716 --> 34:11.681
Hmm.

34:11.683 --> 34:15.452
Hey, you know what?
Since I have you here, would--

34:16.055 --> 34:17.621
Would you mind if I ran through
my pitch?

34:18.457 --> 34:19.456
Please leave.

34:21.126 --> 34:22.225
Right, right, right, of course.

34:23.562 --> 34:24.828
Well,
enjoy the rest of your stay.

34:29.435 --> 34:31.134
[crickets chirping]

34:36.442 --> 34:38.208
I'm terribly sorry, Agnes.

34:42.848 --> 34:44.681
You deserve a proper burial.

34:50.389 --> 34:51.788
And I'll see that you get one.

34:57.296 --> 34:58.428
You're a good woman.

35:00.299 --> 35:01.398
A strong woman.

35:07.339 --> 35:08.772
Not like most of you.

35:09.741 --> 35:11.374
Brunchin' bimbos.

[Lenore] You went a day
without using your cell phone?

37:39.891 --> 37:41.491
Color me impressed.

Yeah, not even. But thank you.

-[Lenore]<i> So what's up?</i>
-[RnB music playing]

37:46.598 --> 37:49.866
I did it.
I ventured outside the bubble.

Get out!

37:51.403 --> 37:55.605
-Yeah, and it fucking blows.

How could you forget?
I'm a real American now.

I'm unemployed.

38:03.282 --> 38:04.547

I hate us.

55:25.690 --> 55:27.756
I was never into psychedelics.

55:28.092 --> 55:31.327
I was just more of a uppers guy.

55:31.329 --> 55:32.094
[chuckles]

55:35.833 --> 55:37.399
Yeah well,
after you killed yourself...

55:37.400 --> 55:38.966
Dad, she lost her mind.
She, like, ran away...

55:40.571 --> 55:42.338
and my whole life
she's been living

55:42.339 --> 55:44.106
-in a fantasy world.
-[Michael] Well, you know, baby,

55:44.108 --> 55:46.909
from my vantage point,
looking down,

55:48.112 --> 55:49.712
it seems
that pretty much everyone

55:49.714 --> 55:52.114
is in their own
little fantasy world

55:52.116 --> 55:53.682
to one degree or another.

55:55.019 --> 55:58.020
And it's all
so counterproductive.

55:58.856 --> 56:01.457
[scoffs]
Well, so is suicide.

56:02.126 --> 56:03.959
I know it's hard for you
to understand.

56:06.130 --> 56:07.396
But I was hurting...

56:08.899 --> 56:09.865
deeply...

56:11.469 --> 56:12.534
for many years.

56:14.872 --> 56:18.407
And I just couldn't... beat it.

56:20.544 --> 56:22.144
But I'm happy now.

56:25.015 --> 56:26.448
And I want you to be happy.

56:27.385 --> 56:29.585
Wait, are you--
Are you advocating for me

56:29.587 --> 56:34.089
-to kill myself, too?
-No! No, Jesus. No.

56:34.692 --> 56:35.958
Do yourself a favor,

56:37.027 --> 56:38.827
and get rid of my ashes.

56:39.930 --> 56:41.897
It's not so important
that they be scattered

56:41.899 --> 56:42.998
to the cosmos.

56:43.968 --> 56:45.901
I just did that
to piss your mother off,

56:45.903 --> 56:48.170
because she over scheduled
our last vacation

56:48.172 --> 56:51.473
to Washington D.C.
and did not give me enough time

56:51.642 --> 56:54.109
at the National Air
and Space Museum.

56:56.046 --> 56:59.948
Well, if you're wondering why
I'm not just bursting with joy

57:00.084 --> 57:03.152
it's probably
because you killed yourself.

57:03.154 --> 57:07.723
And Mom's insane and I got
this stack of student loans,

57:07.725 --> 57:10.793
like, a mile high
and I'm basically alone

57:10.795 --> 57:13.028
in the world,
and my ovaries are drying up.

57:13.431 --> 57:15.564
But how about you start
with not settling

57:15.566 --> 57:16.999
for all those bozos?

57:17.802 --> 57:19.735
-It kills me to see--
-Wait, you better not be able

57:19.737 --> 57:21.170
to watch me have sex
from up there.

57:21.539 --> 57:22.771
I always look away.

57:25.209 --> 57:26.775
-Always.
-Well, forgive me

57:26.777 --> 57:28.811
for not being the best picker.
All right?

57:28.813 --> 57:30.813
I was deprived
of a proper male role model

57:30.815 --> 57:33.015
-growing up.
-Got me there.

57:33.918 --> 57:35.517
Well, I'm so sorry, baby.

57:37.087 --> 57:39.655
I'm sorry
I missed your piano recital.

57:42.593 --> 57:43.892
But I can hear you playing,

57:44.829 --> 57:45.861
from up here.

57:46.964 --> 57:48.630
And you are...

57:51.235 --> 57:52.801
-great!
-Really?

57:53.103 --> 57:54.636
Fantastic stuff.

57:55.706 --> 57:56.705
Thanks, Dad.

57:56.707 --> 58:01.043
-I love you, sweet pea.
-I love you too, Dad.

58:03.514 --> 58:05.180
You keep playing that piano.

58:06.884 --> 58:07.850
I will.

58:10.554 --> 58:12.788

58:45.656 --> 58:49.525
California,
to the New York island.

58:50.861 --> 58:52.728
From the redwood forest...

58:53.864 --> 58:55.564
to the Gulf Stream water.

58:56.901 --> 59:00.269
This land was made for me
and me.

59:02.139 --> 59:03.572
That's right, kids,

59:04.642 --> 59:06.008
Papa made a remix.

59:07.077 --> 59:09.044
What?
You think you're the only ones

59:09.046 --> 59:10.863
that can take something

59:10.864 --> 59:12.681
that works beautifully
and destroy it

59:12.683 --> 59:14.249
for no discernible purpose?

59:16.053 --> 59:18.320
You had to go
and screw it all up.

59:20.558 --> 59:22.891
Now everyone's entitled
to everything.

59:24.061 --> 59:24.993
Land,

59:25.930 --> 59:26.895

59:31.702 --> 59:32.668
Hey!

59:35.739 --> 59:37.873
The hell are you doing out here?

59:38.642 --> 59:42.678
Uh, nothing special.
I just got no place else to go.

59:45.082 --> 59:47.349
You can put your hands down,
I'm not the government.

59:49.086 --> 59:51.320
Just live down the way
and I like to know

59:51.322 --> 59:52.654
who my neighbors are.

59:52.656 --> 59:56.658
Well, I'm just passing through.
I'll be gone in the morning.

1:00:01.632 --> 1:00:03.699
Make sure that fire's out
when you go.

1:00:45.009 --> 1:00:46.074
I made a huge mistake.

1:00:47.144 --> 1:00:50.012
Go easy on yourself.
You're fragile.

1:00:51.048 --> 1:00:52.047
That's very funny.

1:01:06.864 --> 1:01:07.896
But not you.

1:01:08.365 --> 1:01:10.298
It's pronounced asphalt.

please, don't be upset
that I'm only reaching out

1:05:13.076 --> 1:05:14.693
to you now
because I'm coming down

from an acid trip
and terrified for my life.

1:05:17.147 --> 1:05:19.214
Right, plus also not forget
that you gave my dad

which caused him

1:05:21.018 --> 1:05:22.584

to wash her mouth out with soap.

[Uriah] So, could you maybe, uh,

1:06:32.389 --> 1:06:33.655
give me an idea
of where we're going?

1:06:34.291 --> 1:06:37.192
My daughter's in trouble, Uriah.
I can sense it.

1:06:38.161 --> 1:06:39.294
Plus, she texted me.

1:06:39.296 --> 1:06:41.629
Do you think maybe
we should just call the cops?

1:06:41.631 --> 1:06:43.465
Uh-uh. This is my chance.

I'll be damned if anyone's
gonna take that from me.

Well, what if we get there
too late?

happened to her,

'cause...

just speaking from
my perspective,

1:06:59.504 --> 1:07:00.448

maybe this is a little selfish?

before in my life,

don't go far beyond juggling

space here, buddy?

believe in personal space.

out there.

1:12:47.563 --> 1:12:48.596

-What's his name again?
-[Crystal] Uriah.

1:12:54.771 --> 1:12:55.803
Fuck off, Uriah.

1:13:02.412 --> 1:13:04.545
I'm good, I'm just gonna,

What the fuck, man!

1:13:37.480 --> 1:13:41.015
-What is this?
-Used to be my wife's dress.

1:13:44.921 --> 1:13:46.521
If this is a sexual thing,

1:13:46.856 --> 1:13:49.924
I'm just gonna be straight up
with you. I've got HPV.

1:13:50.827 --> 1:13:53.728
Special strain
that melts old man's dicks off.

1:13:57.867 --> 1:13:59.667
It's the very dress
she was wearing,

1:13:59.669 --> 1:14:01.135
the day she took her own life.

1:14:02.539 --> 1:14:03.571
I know what that's like.

1:14:05.208 --> 1:14:06.874
My pops killed himself, too.

1:14:09.179 --> 1:14:10.478
Small fuckin' world.

1:14:11.981 --> 1:14:13.781
My deepest condolences.

1:14:17.620 --> 1:14:21.456
So, backtracking,
for just a moment.

1:14:21.691 --> 1:14:25.893
Um, what the fuck am I doing
wearing your dead wife's dress

1:14:25.895 --> 1:14:27.829
and why the fuck are you
trying to kill me with...

1:14:29.999 --> 1:14:31.532
Is that a tomahawk?

1:14:37.974 --> 1:14:41.042
Textbook cultural appropriation,
man. Jesus.

1:14:42.245 --> 1:14:45.780
It's nothing personal.
It's not you, it's just, it--

1:14:45.982 --> 1:14:47.782
It's everything you represent.

1:14:49.486 --> 1:14:51.586
Oh, cool, cool.

1:14:51.588 --> 1:14:53.521

taking this one for the team.

Yeah, I...

1:15:10.507 --> 1:15:11.739
It's always been my dream.

1:15:15.545 --> 1:15:16.811
we didn't have dreams.

1:15:17.714 --> 1:15:19.180
We just worked hard.

1:15:19.949 --> 1:15:22.650
Then what the fuck
are you so nostalgic for?

1:15:22.652 --> 1:15:25.753

when men were men

1:15:25.755 --> 1:15:28.523

And little girls like you

1:15:28.525 --> 1:15:30.691

your god damn mouths.

that folks like me

1:15:38.935 --> 1:15:40.301

1:15:40.837 --> 1:15:43.170

of the arts.

1:15:44.107 --> 1:15:46.040

1:15:53.583 --> 1:15:54.782
you start to develop

1:15:54.784 --> 1:15:57.184
a real strong sense
of mortality.

1:15:57.186 --> 1:15:58.920

to play the fucking piano
