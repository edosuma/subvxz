00:07.529 --> 00:09.052
Previously, on
"Better Call Saul"...

00:09.183 --> 00:11.402
Did I mention
the signing bonus?

00:11.533 --> 00:15.145
I got a name.
Rand Casimiro. Retired judge.

00:15.276 --> 00:17.060
And what about your husband,
ma'am?

00:17.191 --> 00:21.195
He must have said
something to you.

00:21.325 --> 00:23.197
All roads lead back
to you.

00:23.327 --> 00:25.242
I'd like to think
that this ends it.

00:25.373 --> 00:27.070
Probably not.

00:27.201 --> 00:29.333
I need to know
everything he does.

00:29.464 --> 00:31.509
I let him suck me
into his game.

00:31.640 --> 00:35.035
Because you know
what's coming next.

01:10.244 --> 01:12.333
And here she is.Oh, my God.

01:12.463 --> 01:13.899
Kimmy.

01:14.030 --> 01:14.944
Really?

01:15.075 --> 01:17.294
What is going on
with you?

01:17.425 --> 01:19.122
She's never done anything
like this before.

01:19.253 --> 01:21.255
Never.
She's a straight-A student.

01:21.385 --> 01:22.517
She's always got her nose
in a book.

01:22.647 --> 01:23.822
Well, I don't know
what to tell you, ma'am.

01:23.953 --> 01:26.564
She was caught
red-handed.

01:26.695 --> 01:28.088
A thief.

01:28.218 --> 01:31.395
You know better
than this, Kim.

01:31.526 --> 01:32.831
I-I'd say
I'm disappointed,

01:32.962 --> 01:35.921
but that doesn't even begin
to cover it.

01:36.052 --> 01:38.489
What happens now?

01:38.620 --> 01:40.100
Well when
the merchandise in question

01:40.230 --> 01:41.710
is over $20 in value,

01:41.840 --> 01:46.193
it is company policy
to call the police.

01:46.323 --> 01:48.282
The police.

01:48.412 --> 01:50.762
You know what?
Maybe that's for the best.

01:50.893 --> 01:51.937
Nip it in the bud.

01:52.068 --> 01:54.375
I mean,
protecting her

01:54.505 --> 01:57.943
from the consequences
of her own actions...I do have
some discretion here.

01:58.074 --> 01:58.988
Um....

02:00.511 --> 02:02.209
Our main concern
is we just don't want to see

02:02.339 --> 02:04.298
the same faces
over and over.

02:04.428 --> 02:09.564
So if you can promise me that
this was a one-time thing...

02:09.694 --> 02:12.088
Well, Kim.
You heard Mr. Pearson.

02:12.219 --> 02:13.872
Are you going to do it
again?

02:14.003 --> 02:15.439
No.

02:15.570 --> 02:17.833
I'd like
to believe that.

02:17.963 --> 02:22.272
And what was so wonderful
that you just had to steal it?

02:24.448 --> 02:25.449
Earrings.

02:25.580 --> 02:28.670
What?
I-I can't even hear you.

02:28.800 --> 02:30.150
Earrings
and a necklace.

02:31.151 --> 02:33.544
Earrings
and a necklace.

02:33.675 --> 02:35.503
Unbelievable.

02:35.633 --> 02:37.722
It's part of our new
Starlight Collection.

02:37.853 --> 02:40.290
It's priced at $34.50,
but that one is unsellable.

02:40.421 --> 02:43.859
The chain was broken when she
tried to hide it in that purse.

02:43.989 --> 02:47.210
My God. $34.50?
What about tax?

02:47.341 --> 02:48.864
No, I-I don't expect you
to...

02:48.994 --> 02:50.431
I'm not paying for it,
sheis.

02:50.561 --> 02:52.084
This is coming out
of your allowance.

02:52.215 --> 02:54.522
I don't care
if it takes 10 years.

02:54.652 --> 02:57.786
She's going to wish
we called the police.

02:57.916 --> 03:02.225
Mr.
Well, including sales tax,
it's $35.53.

03:02.356 --> 03:04.009
Thirty-five...

03:04.140 --> 03:06.490
Uh, i-it's --
it's really not necessary.

03:06.621 --> 03:09.493
Mnh.This is...

03:09.624 --> 03:12.279
I can -- I can give you $13
right now.Uh...

03:12.409 --> 03:13.932
And we'll come back
with the rest.

03:14.063 --> 03:18.328
Ma'am.
Really, i-it's fine.

03:19.547 --> 03:23.115
You've been
very, very kind.

03:23.246 --> 03:25.466
Well, Kim,
what do we say?

03:27.642 --> 03:29.426
Thank you.

03:38.043 --> 03:41.351
Y'know, you got
a fine mother there.

03:41.482 --> 03:43.266
You don't want to
disappoint her again.

03:46.269 --> 03:47.488
Thank you
for being so understanding.

03:47.618 --> 03:49.490
Oh,
my pleasure.

03:52.406 --> 03:54.277
Best of luck.

04:11.599 --> 04:15.255
"Nip it in the bud..."

04:23.437 --> 04:27.310
I didn't know
you had it in you.

04:29.181 --> 04:30.574
Here.

04:30.705 --> 04:33.621
I got you something.

04:33.751 --> 04:35.187
See?

04:35.318 --> 04:37.929
Your mom's good
for something, hm?

04:42.456 --> 04:45.676
Hey, kiddo, relax.

04:45.807 --> 04:47.852
You got away with it.

04:47.983 --> 04:50.551
[Duran Duran's

07:03.858 --> 07:05.903
Hi.

07:06.034 --> 07:07.862
Morning.

07:07.992 --> 07:09.211
How'd you sleep?

07:10.081 --> 07:12.432
Good. And you?

07:13.215 --> 07:15.826
Alright, I think.

07:15.957 --> 07:17.262
Didn't you say something

07:17.393 --> 07:19.700
about replacing the mattress
out there?

07:20.831 --> 07:22.572
It's fine.

07:27.055 --> 07:28.926
That is for you.

07:30.406 --> 07:31.494
Thanks.

07:38.240 --> 07:41.939
We should talk about
the Abramson fundraiser.

07:42.070 --> 07:44.725
Is that coming up?Next Friday.

07:46.291 --> 07:48.903
I can't believe
it's been a whole year...

07:49.033 --> 07:50.513
How do you want
to handle it?

07:50.644 --> 07:55.083
Well, however you want.
You can go, or I can go.

07:55.213 --> 08:00.523
Or, if it's easier,
we could both go.

08:00.654 --> 08:02.525
I'll go.

08:02.656 --> 08:05.093
Sure.

08:05.223 --> 08:08.836
Probably for the best.

08:08.966 --> 08:11.578
Uh, actually, t-there is
something you should know about.

08:11.708 --> 08:13.101
A situation
I'm dealing with.

08:13.231 --> 08:15.973
Y-You remember what was going on
with Chuck's brother, Jimmy?

08:16.104 --> 08:20.108
You mean with the bowling balls
and...so on?

08:20.238 --> 08:21.239
That's not over with?

08:21.370 --> 08:23.981
Mmh-mmh.
I think it's getting worse.

08:24.112 --> 08:27.898
In fact, it's possible
you might hear or see something.

08:28.029 --> 08:30.205
I couldn't say what.

08:30.335 --> 08:33.556
Just know that, if you do --
whatever it is --

08:33.687 --> 08:35.558
I'm handling it.

08:35.689 --> 08:37.125
I will put an end to this.

08:37.255 --> 08:40.171
Whatever it takes.

08:40.302 --> 08:41.521
I thought you should know.

08:44.436 --> 08:46.438
Duly noted.

08:46.569 --> 08:48.571
I'm having dinner
with the Appels tonight,

08:48.702 --> 08:51.531
so you've got the house
to yourself.

08:51.661 --> 08:53.010
Tell them I said hello.

08:53.141 --> 08:55.273
I will.

09:10.985 --> 09:14.641
- He saw clients
starting at- 00 a.m.

09:14.771 --> 09:17.948
One tried to bring a pet
cockatiel into the waiting room.

09:18.079 --> 09:20.995
That caused
a bit of a ruckus.

09:21.125 --> 09:24.738
Then it was more clients
until lunch at15.

09:24.868 --> 09:28.437
Takeout for him and the
receptionist -- Taco Cabeza.

09:28.568 --> 09:31.005
After that,
another four clients.

09:31.135 --> 09:33.529
He left the office
around00.

09:33.660 --> 09:37.707
Made a quick stop for coffee --
same place as the day before.

09:37.838 --> 09:39.883
- 30 to- 20,
he was down at the courthouse

09:40.014 --> 09:41.232
for a bail hearing.

09:41.363 --> 09:43.104
Then back to the office.

09:43.234 --> 09:45.019
Home at 10 after00.

09:46.716 --> 09:48.631
Wednesday was more
of the same.

09:48.762 --> 09:50.111
Out at30.

09:50.241 --> 09:52.026
Got to the office
by a quarter-of.

09:52.156 --> 09:53.549
Clients all day.

09:53.680 --> 09:55.290
Uh, that takes
to the second composite,

09:55.420 --> 09:56.857
case you want to
check them out for yourself.

09:56.987 --> 10:00.425
He got lunch for himself
and his receptionist

10:00.556 --> 10:01.644
at around30.

10:01.775 --> 10:03.559
The Vietnamese place again.

10:03.690 --> 10:05.517
Then, in the --What's this?

10:05.648 --> 10:07.519
Yeah, I was just
getting to that.

10:07.650 --> 10:10.740
That was three days ago.
Only time he broke the pattern.

10:10.871 --> 10:12.699
Stopped at Cradock Marine
over on Central

10:12.829 --> 10:15.005
instead of going
straight to the office.

10:15.136 --> 10:17.878
Looked like he made
a cash withdrawal.

10:18.008 --> 10:19.488
I couldn't get a good angle
through the window,

10:19.619 --> 10:22.883
but I counted four,
maybe five stacks?

10:23.013 --> 10:25.886
I'd say somewhere
in the ballpark of 20 grand.

10:27.888 --> 10:31.239
I'm not a lawyer,
but is there any reason

10:31.369 --> 10:34.285
he'd need that much cash in
the normal course of business?

10:37.158 --> 10:39.987
No legitimatereason.

11:00.485 --> 11:02.923
Mr.
Thank you so much, Doc.Of course. Of course.
Come on in.

11:03.053 --> 11:04.402
We'll take a look.

11:04.533 --> 11:06.448
It's gonna be okay.

11:06.578 --> 11:08.624
Gonna be okay.

11:10.670 --> 11:13.281
Come on.

11:13.411 --> 11:15.936
Okay.
Fernando's gonna be fine.

11:16.066 --> 11:18.155
The shot I gave him
will settle his stomach.

11:18.286 --> 11:20.201
But I want to keep him
for a few more minutes,

11:20.331 --> 11:22.159
make sure he doesn't have
any reactions.

11:22.290 --> 11:24.509
After that,
you're all set.That's such a relief.

11:24.640 --> 11:27.208
We were so worried.We're lucky
you were able to see us.

11:27.338 --> 11:28.557
Ah, it's no problem.

11:28.688 --> 11:29.732
I was already here
with another patient.

11:29.863 --> 11:33.344
Alright.Be back.

11:50.884 --> 11:53.234
Alright.
How are we doing?

11:53.364 --> 11:56.063
I dunno, um, I guess
my skin's a little dry

11:56.193 --> 11:59.980
where you put that stuff on,
but otherwise...

12:03.940 --> 12:06.595
Are you sure
you used enough?

12:06.726 --> 12:07.901
Absolutely.

12:08.031 --> 12:09.946
Just give it
a little more time.

12:10.077 --> 12:11.992
Look all the way
to the right.

12:12.122 --> 12:14.908
Now to the left.

12:15.038 --> 12:16.823
What's it gonna
feel like?

12:16.953 --> 12:20.435
Depends on how
used to caffeine you are.

12:20.565 --> 12:24.178
I mean, you're not gonna be
trippin' balls, but...

12:24.308 --> 12:25.832
it's gonna feel like,
you know,

12:25.962 --> 12:28.573
two Red Bulls
on an empty stomach.

12:28.704 --> 12:30.706
And how long
is it gonna last?

12:30.837 --> 12:32.577
Is the guy
roughly your size?

12:32.708 --> 12:34.754
Yeah.

12:34.884 --> 12:36.930
An hour or two.

12:37.060 --> 12:39.802
And if there's
a blood test?

12:39.933 --> 12:41.935
This stuff is not showing up
on any blood panel

12:42.065 --> 12:43.675
they're running
in this town.

12:43.806 --> 12:45.982
You're gonna do this,
this is the way to go.

12:47.897 --> 12:49.681
Here.Whoa, whoa.

12:49.812 --> 12:51.596
Promise me
this has been sterilized.

12:51.727 --> 12:53.903
It's brand new,

12:54.034 --> 12:57.080
and for you,
it goes under the armpit.

12:57.211 --> 12:58.255
Okay.

12:58.386 --> 12:59.866
Sorry.

13:01.171 --> 13:06.046
I cannot wait to be done
with all of this.

13:06.176 --> 13:08.309
I hear ya.
You know, I read somewhere

13:08.439 --> 13:11.181
that vets are even more
depressed than lawyers.

13:11.312 --> 13:12.966
Depressed?

13:13.096 --> 13:14.663
No, no, no, no, no.

13:14.794 --> 13:17.405
I love being a vet.

13:17.535 --> 13:19.320
Look over there.

13:19.450 --> 13:21.235
See that?

13:21.365 --> 13:23.890
That's what
it's all about.

13:24.020 --> 13:25.500
Animals are my life.

13:25.630 --> 13:28.677
It's this other stuff
that's getting to be too much,

13:28.808 --> 13:30.157
no offense.

13:32.507 --> 13:35.510
Anyway, a guy's gotta know
when he's bagged his limit.

13:35.640 --> 13:38.078
What --
so you're closing up shop?

13:38.208 --> 13:40.123
Yep. Leaving town.

13:40.254 --> 13:41.995
Once I sell
my little black book,

13:42.125 --> 13:44.345
it's gonna be all animals,
all the time.

13:44.475 --> 13:46.086
Black book?

13:46.216 --> 13:48.088
Yeah, the keys
to the kingdom.

13:48.218 --> 13:51.308
You know, you call me up,
you're looking for a someone?

13:51.439 --> 13:54.224
Keep all my "someones"
in here.

13:54.355 --> 13:56.705
Can I see it?

14:01.797 --> 14:04.104
Knock yourself out.

14:04.234 --> 14:07.542
Oh.

14:07.672 --> 14:09.587
Alright, yeah.
I think we, uh --

14:09.718 --> 14:11.894
we found
the Zodiac Killer.

14:12.025 --> 14:17.813
Well...I'm not keeping my
contacts in plain English.

14:17.944 --> 14:20.555
"Best Quality Vacuum"?

14:20.685 --> 14:24.820
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah.

14:24.951 --> 14:27.344
Alright.
Let's give it another 10.

14:27.475 --> 14:29.303
I'll be back.

14:32.219 --> 14:34.264
What a waste.

14:34.395 --> 14:36.397
You think?

14:36.527 --> 14:39.139
Did you see how many
people he had in that book?

14:39.269 --> 14:42.707
I mean, he's raking it in,
day in, day out.

14:42.838 --> 14:45.580
It's passive income.
Minimal risk.

14:45.710 --> 14:48.322
I can't believe
he's walking away from that.

14:48.452 --> 14:51.368
Well...

14:51.499 --> 14:55.503
he knows
what he wants.

14:55.633 --> 14:57.374
Anything?

14:57.505 --> 15:01.726
Not really.

15:01.857 --> 15:03.598
Oh, my God.

15:03.728 --> 15:05.208
What?
Uh...

15:11.954 --> 15:14.391
Whoa.

15:19.222 --> 15:22.312
Judge Hold on. Hold on.
Let's just cut to the chase.

15:22.443 --> 15:25.402
Your client -- who has, let's
call it a "checkered" past,

15:25.533 --> 15:28.275
was pulled over for a clear
violation of traffic laws

15:28.405 --> 15:32.235
and found in possession of
a felony quantity of marijuana.

15:32.366 --> 15:34.977
And now you're asking me
to throw out this evidence?

15:35.108 --> 15:37.023
In words of one syllable,

15:37.153 --> 15:40.330
how does this pass
the smell test?

15:40.461 --> 15:43.333
Your Honor

15:43.464 --> 15:46.554
this is what
this is all about.

15:46.684 --> 15:48.556
According to
Officer Connell's report,

15:48.686 --> 15:51.254
this is the reason
Joshua Holcome was pulled over.

15:51.385 --> 15:54.692
New Mexico statue 66-3-846.

15:54.823 --> 15:57.217
Driving with
an obstructed window.

15:57.347 --> 15:59.784
This morning,
I did an informal survey

15:59.915 --> 16:01.308
of the courthouse parking lot.

16:01.438 --> 16:03.875
And by my count,
over a third of the vehicles

16:04.006 --> 16:07.488
had something similar hanging
from their rear-view mirrors.

16:07.618 --> 16:11.231
I believe your car
was one of them, Your Honor.

16:11.361 --> 16:15.887
So unless you
and 47 of our colleagues

16:16.018 --> 16:18.412
have outstanding tickets,
I'd argue that this statute

16:18.542 --> 16:21.110
is not...
regularly enforced.

16:21.241 --> 16:23.895
Your Honor, this was
a perfectly reasonable,

16:24.026 --> 16:25.723
routine stop for cause.

16:25.854 --> 16:27.203
Uh,
what's the point here?

16:27.334 --> 16:29.901
The point is
that this was not routine.

16:30.032 --> 16:31.381
Officer Connell
knew my client.

16:31.512 --> 16:33.470
In fact,
he arrested him five years ago

16:33.601 --> 16:35.168
when Joshua was a juvenile.

16:35.298 --> 16:36.691
And Officer Connell's
record shows

16:36.821 --> 16:38.475
that this is only
the third citation

16:38.606 --> 16:41.435
he's written for this statute
in almost 20 years.

16:41.565 --> 16:44.873
So either this is
an incredible coincidence

16:45.004 --> 16:47.658
or Officer Connell
recognized my client

16:47.789 --> 16:49.312
and used the dangler
as a pretext

16:49.443 --> 16:51.749
to violate
his Fourth Amendment rights.

16:51.880 --> 16:54.274
Your Honor, all I'm asking
is that you take another look

16:54.404 --> 16:55.710
at the officer's statement.

16:55.840 --> 16:58.234
Ask yourself
if the state's version of events

16:58.365 --> 17:00.410
passes the "smell test."

17:07.069 --> 17:08.201
That was nicely argued.

17:08.331 --> 17:10.072
Thanks. We'll see
what the judge does.

17:12.248 --> 17:14.511
Defense like that takes time
to pull together, doesn't it?

17:14.642 --> 17:16.296
Whaddya think it took --
30 hours?

17:16.426 --> 17:19.212
Oh, probably
more like 50.

17:19.342 --> 17:21.692
50 hours. Huh.

17:21.823 --> 17:23.694
And the contracts office --
they pay...?

17:23.825 --> 17:25.914
$700 a case. Flat.

17:26.045 --> 17:28.743
So you're making minimum wage,
more or less.

17:32.007 --> 17:34.227
Whew.

17:34.357 --> 17:36.751
I've been meaning to ask,
if you don't mind...

17:36.881 --> 17:39.319
how did you leave things
with Howard Hamlin?

17:42.322 --> 17:45.238
I wouldn't be here today
if it wasn't for Howard.

17:46.587 --> 17:49.851
I wouldn't be an attorney.
I wouldn't have met my husband.

17:51.505 --> 17:56.205
I owe Howard and HHM
a lot.

18:03.604 --> 18:06.563
Have you heard of
the Jackson Mercer Foundation?

18:07.825 --> 18:09.175
Of course.

18:09.305 --> 18:11.351
They fund justice reform
programs on the East Coast.

18:11.481 --> 18:13.353
I wish we had something
like that out here.

18:13.483 --> 18:18.227
Well, it's a bit hush-hush
at the moment, but we will soon.

18:18.358 --> 18:20.795
And that's what I wanted
to talk to you about.

18:29.151 --> 18:32.502
We're closed!

18:32.633 --> 18:34.591
Francesca?

18:39.292 --> 18:40.945
Oh, Kim!

18:41.076 --> 18:42.338
Hi!

18:42.469 --> 18:43.600
Hey.Come on -- Come on in.

18:43.731 --> 18:45.298
Thanks.It's good to see you.

18:45.428 --> 18:47.691
You, too.
Jimmy was so, uh, thrilled...

18:47.822 --> 18:49.563
...when you said
you would work for him again.

18:49.693 --> 18:52.740
Well, so far, so good.
It's no Wexler-McGill.

18:52.870 --> 18:55.221
They're -- They're
still working in the back.

18:55.351 --> 18:58.789
Oh, okay.
My God, look at this place!

18:58.920 --> 19:02.010
Yeah, Jimmy --
Oh, sorry, "Saul,"

19:02.141 --> 19:04.055
is letting me take
a free hand.

19:04.186 --> 19:07.189
I'm going for a vibe
that's professional and refined

19:07.320 --> 19:10.410
but, still,
you know, inviting.

19:10.540 --> 19:12.194
Oh,
it's definitely inviting.

19:12.325 --> 19:13.761
It's -- It's...

19:13.891 --> 19:15.023
It's classy!

19:15.154 --> 19:16.198
Thanks!

19:16.329 --> 19:17.895
I don't know
if you saw it before,

19:18.026 --> 19:20.333
but it's come
a long way.

19:20.463 --> 19:23.292
That whole back wall
is brand new.

19:23.423 --> 19:25.990
Um, everything
has been repainted.

19:26.121 --> 19:27.644
I know
there's a lot of molding.

19:27.775 --> 19:29.907
I-I found a contractor
who does it for a price --

19:30.038 --> 19:32.867
so I just went for it.

19:32.997 --> 19:36.958
I've also got a pair
of water features coming.

19:37.088 --> 19:38.873
For serenity.

19:39.003 --> 19:41.223
Wow, Francesca,
you really have an eye!

19:41.354 --> 19:44.574
Well, it's still
a work in progress.

19:44.705 --> 19:47.708
Well, I can't wait to see
the final product.

19:47.838 --> 19:49.362
But I know
you were on your way out.

19:49.492 --> 19:50.450
I don't want to
keep you.

19:50.580 --> 19:52.582
Yeah,
I should get going.

19:52.713 --> 19:54.802
Oh, yeah.

19:54.932 --> 19:56.586
Congratulations!

19:56.717 --> 19:58.675
The wedding?

19:58.806 --> 20:01.591
Uh, uh, y-- Saul told me
you guys got married.

20:01.722 --> 20:04.464
I, um...

20:04.594 --> 20:08.816
C-Can I ask, are --
are you registered anywhere?

20:08.946 --> 20:13.168
That is so sweet,
but, uh

20:13.299 --> 20:15.301
no, it was all
very low key.

20:15.431 --> 20:17.041
We have
everything we need.

20:17.172 --> 20:18.826
Okay.

20:18.956 --> 20:20.697
Well,
it's great to see you...

20:20.828 --> 20:22.699
Yeah, you, too....again.

20:22.830 --> 20:24.875
Mm.

20:25.006 --> 20:26.703
Have a good night,
Francesca.

20:40.935 --> 20:42.415
Hm.

20:43.285 --> 20:44.417
Sound Where are
the extra batteries?

20:44.547 --> 20:47.942
Camera Black bag,
front pocket...

20:48.072 --> 20:49.944
Umm. Well,
this could work, right?

20:50.074 --> 20:52.381
No, our guy has more
of a curl on the ends.

20:52.512 --> 20:54.078
Camera Doesn't matter.
Nothing matters.

20:54.209 --> 20:55.297
It's an action shot.

20:55.428 --> 20:56.777
I'm gonna shoot
it 1/13 of a second.

20:56.907 --> 20:58.257
Give it some blur.Blur? No!

20:58.387 --> 20:59.954
No blur, okay?

21:00.084 --> 21:02.435
We need him to be recognized --
that's the whole point.

21:02.565 --> 21:04.741
Kim, hey!

21:04.872 --> 21:06.221
Hey, everyone.
Hi.

21:06.352 --> 21:07.440
We started late
because someone took forever

21:07.570 --> 21:08.702
to get the equipment.

21:08.832 --> 21:10.617
I don't control
when they do inventory.

21:10.747 --> 21:13.315
Hey. I'm playing a man
of substance, am I not?What?

21:13.446 --> 21:15.665
I see him as a man of means.
Of style.

21:15.796 --> 21:18.102
Uh, no,
these are just stills, Lenny.

21:18.233 --> 21:21.367
Just keep it simple.Well, b-but just --
just to ask, though,

21:21.497 --> 21:25.327
wouldn't my character grow
something more like that?

21:25.458 --> 21:28.417
It's docudrama.
Doc -- reality, right?

21:28.548 --> 21:30.767
Just keep it simple
and no improvisation.

21:30.898 --> 21:33.030
Yes. Yes. Yes.

21:33.161 --> 21:34.989
He's gonna be great.
C'mere.

21:35.119 --> 21:36.904
Weigh in on this.

21:37.034 --> 21:40.777
Okay. Uh...

21:40.908 --> 21:41.909
Alright.

21:42.039 --> 21:44.215
Let's try this one.

21:44.346 --> 21:47.044
Just trim it a little bit
and put wax on the ends.

21:47.175 --> 21:48.350
Yes!

21:48.481 --> 21:50.091
That one --
trimmed and waxed.

21:50.221 --> 21:53.094
-You got it.

21:53.224 --> 21:55.401
Everything okay?

21:55.531 --> 21:59.274
Yeah, yeah.
I'll talk to you later.

21:59.405 --> 22:02.146
Let's keep this going.
You wanna...?

22:02.277 --> 22:04.018
10 minutes to set,
guys.

22:04.148 --> 22:05.933
Oh. Thank you, 10.

22:07.500 --> 22:11.242
You're doing great.I am, aren't I?

22:11.373 --> 22:13.636
Holy shit!
The Jackson Mercer Foundation.

22:13.767 --> 22:16.813
That's like the Good
Housekeeping Seal of Approval.

22:16.944 --> 22:19.816
Well, it --
it's not a done deal.

22:19.947 --> 22:21.949
Uh... Some of
the foundation board members

22:22.079 --> 22:24.386
are flying in next week
to meet the Lieutenant Governor

22:24.517 --> 22:26.257
at a luncheon
in Santa Fe.

22:26.388 --> 22:29.957
So they are inviting
a select group of people with...

22:30.087 --> 22:32.481
Cliff called them
"up and coming organizations."

22:32.612 --> 22:36.485
And, uh, yeah,
Cliff thinks I have a good shot.

22:36.616 --> 22:38.357
A good "shot"?
You have more than a shot.

22:38.487 --> 22:40.620
They're gonna love you
on sight!

22:40.750 --> 22:43.971
The only thing is,
the lunch is on D-Day.

22:44.101 --> 22:46.016
So? What? That's --

22:46.147 --> 22:48.541
You don't have to be there
on the day.

22:48.671 --> 22:51.282
Was Eisenhower
on Omaha Beach? No!

22:52.327 --> 22:56.026
Kim, this is great.
Right?

22:56.157 --> 22:59.203
It's huge.

22:59.334 --> 23:02.250
It ispretty great.
Kim, this is fantastic!

24:31.557 --> 24:34.473
Yeah, sorry.
I don't speak any German.

24:34.603 --> 24:37.171
Are you lost?

24:37.301 --> 24:39.652
It's a beautiful place
you have here.

24:39.782 --> 24:43.046
The air,
it's just so fresh.

24:48.182 --> 24:50.837
Do I know you?

24:50.967 --> 24:55.102
Well, I don't think
we've officially met.

26:48.781 --> 26:50.913
Who are you?

26:51.044 --> 26:55.744
Who are you?!

26:55.875 --> 26:58.660
Ed-Eduardo...Salamanca.

27:00.488 --> 27:02.446
I'm not here for you...

27:04.710 --> 27:06.929
T-This is about Fring.

27:07.060 --> 27:10.629
I want to know.

27:12.282 --> 27:14.154
I want to know
what he's building.

27:16.243 --> 27:18.332
How did you find me?

27:18.462 --> 27:21.248
M-Margarethe...

27:21.378 --> 27:23.250
M-Margarethe Z-Ziegler.

27:23.380 --> 27:26.166
What have you done to her?

27:26.296 --> 27:27.907
Nothing. Nothing.

27:28.037 --> 27:30.736
You sent her...
a g-gift.

27:44.227 --> 27:45.664
Was ist das?

27:58.024 --> 28:00.374
Carajo.

28:00.504 --> 28:02.419
I think you broke
one of my ribs.

28:12.125 --> 28:13.953
Here.

28:16.912 --> 28:20.176
Tie that off
before you bleed to death.

28:20.307 --> 28:22.962
You and I are
gonna have a talk.

29:06.788 --> 29:08.355
The last thing you want
is to look like

29:08.485 --> 29:09.965
you're some kind of loner.

29:10.096 --> 29:11.619
If someone
can come with you,

29:11.750 --> 29:13.926
a boyfriend or girlfriend,
that's a good thing.

29:14.056 --> 29:16.189
If you can convince your mom,
that's even better.

29:16.319 --> 29:18.017
I mean, if granny's
still alive, jackpot.

29:18.147 --> 29:19.453
Thank you, m'dear.

29:19.583 --> 29:21.716
So, if you will just sign
on the dotted line...

29:21.847 --> 29:25.067
...we'll have you back to
the Rusty Bucket by happy hour.

29:25.198 --> 29:27.026
You made that call,
right?

29:27.156 --> 29:28.723
Uh...Try to
make it legi--

29:28.854 --> 29:31.030
About that. I-I just had
a couple of questions.

29:31.160 --> 29:34.207
Francesca, can we sidebar
in the law library?

29:41.562 --> 29:43.694
What is the holdup?

29:43.825 --> 29:46.088
I just... I-I don't know
if I'm comfortable.

29:46.219 --> 29:47.481
Is this even legal?

29:47.611 --> 29:49.700
I'm sorry, which of us
went to law school?

29:49.831 --> 29:51.702
Because I could stand here
and go through the ins and outs

29:51.833 --> 29:55.489
of what's quote, unquote
legal with you, uh,
but we're on a clock.

29:55.619 --> 29:58.622
I just don't --Francesca, let's get
something straight, okay?

29:58.753 --> 30:02.539
We can't be holding a graduate
seminar in Constitutional Law

30:02.670 --> 30:03.845
every time I give you
something to do.

30:03.976 --> 30:06.630
But I --
Uh, I-I'm not sure I feel --

30:06.761 --> 30:09.459
You know what I'm paying you.
It is above market.

30:09.590 --> 30:12.288
To whom much is given,
much is expected.

30:12.419 --> 30:13.899
We're not gonna make a habit
of this, right?

30:14.029 --> 30:16.466
Of course not. Absolutely.
No, no, no.

30:16.597 --> 30:18.381
Here. Put it on speaker
and let me hear.

30:20.775 --> 30:22.255
HHM
Hamlin Hamlin McGill.

30:22.385 --> 30:25.911
Uh.
Hi, um, there.

30:26.041 --> 30:29.697
Uh, I'm calling because my --
my mother is -- is...

30:29.828 --> 30:31.568
Well, I guess
she's a-a client of yours.

30:31.699 --> 30:35.703
She lives in the
Sandpiper Assisted Living...?

30:35.834 --> 30:37.487
Sandpiper? Of course.

30:37.618 --> 30:39.925
Let me transfer you.

30:40.055 --> 30:42.710
It's just a phone call.HHM
Good afternoon.

30:42.841 --> 30:45.234
Do you have a question about
the Sandpiper Crossing case?

30:45.365 --> 30:48.324
Uh, yes. My mother's out
at the facility in Amarillo.

30:48.455 --> 30:52.546
Says she's supposed to call in
to some meeting on Thursday?

30:52.676 --> 30:55.070
Yes, you're talking about
the mediation?That's it.

30:55.201 --> 30:56.898
Uh, thing is, she lost

30:57.029 --> 30:59.988
her dial-in instructions.

31:00.119 --> 31:02.556
I'm just looking everywhere
and can't find them.

31:02.686 --> 31:05.341
I'd be happy
to help you with that.

31:05.472 --> 31:07.387
It's very important to us
that all the class members

31:07.517 --> 31:08.605
are fully looped in.

31:08.736 --> 31:09.955
What's your mother's name?

31:10.085 --> 31:11.826
Uh, Marnie Stuber.

31:11.957 --> 31:15.351
That's --
That's S-T-U-B-E-R.

31:15.482 --> 31:18.354
Oh.
Bless your heart.

31:18.485 --> 31:20.356
She'll be so relieved.

31:20.487 --> 31:22.315
Okay. It's very simple.

31:22.445 --> 31:24.708
The meeting is happening
at our offices,

31:24.839 --> 31:26.493
so she just has to call
the main line,

31:26.623 --> 31:28.190
the same number
you called just now,

31:28.321 --> 31:30.584
press 7,
and then enter the passcode.

31:30.714 --> 31:32.891
I can give that to you now.
Do you have a pen?

31:33.021 --> 31:33.935
Uh.

31:34.066 --> 31:36.372
Yeah, yeah.
Yup. I-I'm ready.

31:36.503 --> 31:37.721
Okay.

31:37.852 --> 31:41.856
It's 8-4-2-1-5-9.

31:41.987 --> 31:45.381
8-4-2-1-5-9?

31:45.512 --> 31:47.601
That's right.Okay.

31:47.731 --> 31:49.951
Uh, thank you so much.
I really appreciate it.

31:50.082 --> 31:51.257
Of course. Take care.

31:51.387 --> 31:52.519
Mm.

31:52.649 --> 31:54.608
Was that so hard?

32:03.095 --> 32:05.314
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Stop!

32:05.445 --> 32:06.359
No, wait!
Don't turn around!

32:06.489 --> 32:07.534
What?Finish what you're doing!

32:07.664 --> 32:08.839
Yeah, yeah, yeah.Finish.

32:08.970 --> 32:10.145
Uh, yeah.Hey, where are you going?

32:10.276 --> 32:11.886
Cleanup on aisle nine!

32:12.017 --> 32:13.714
Youclean it up.

32:17.500 --> 32:19.415
Steady.

33:10.336 --> 33:11.685
Need something?

33:11.815 --> 33:14.383
Yeah.
The boss sent me.

33:14.514 --> 33:16.907
He wants to know why
you took guys off your house.

33:17.038 --> 33:18.648
I haven't been home
for more than an hour

33:18.779 --> 33:21.042
in the last three weeks.Still.

33:21.173 --> 33:23.392
Salamanca knows who you are.
He could show up there.

33:23.523 --> 33:26.743
We're stretched thin.
I made a judgment call.

33:26.874 --> 33:29.224
Yeah. Stretched thin.

33:29.355 --> 33:32.053
You got guys at, uh,
the lawyers', the garage,

33:32.184 --> 33:34.534
Varga's upholstery shop,
El Mich...
Your point?

33:34.664 --> 33:36.840
Seems to me the most obvious
place to pull from

33:36.971 --> 33:38.451
is Alameda Street.

33:38.581 --> 33:40.192
My guys stay on Alameda.

33:40.322 --> 33:43.064
Alameda is a long shot.

33:43.195 --> 33:47.242
The boss has a problem,
he knows how to reach me.

33:47.373 --> 33:51.029
If youhave a problem...

33:51.159 --> 33:52.900
I'm right here.

34:26.716 --> 34:28.892
Hey, Bryan.

34:29.023 --> 34:30.807
Thanks, Mike.

34:49.609 --> 34:52.264
Thanks.

35:08.889 --> 35:10.630
Hey, honey.

35:10.760 --> 35:12.806
Just a sec, Mike.

35:12.936 --> 35:14.808
Almost ready.

35:17.593 --> 35:19.813
Want to know the star
closest to Earth?

35:19.943 --> 35:21.771
Huh? Tell me.

35:21.902 --> 35:22.729
It's the sun.

35:22.859 --> 35:24.818
That's right.

35:24.948 --> 35:25.775
Hi, Pop-Pop!

35:25.906 --> 35:27.995
Hey, kiddo.

35:28.126 --> 35:30.171
You ready
for some star-gazing?

35:30.302 --> 35:31.738
Yeah!

35:31.868 --> 35:34.828
How's your view?
Not too much light?

35:34.958 --> 35:36.525
No, it's good.

35:36.656 --> 35:39.006
Good.

35:39.137 --> 35:40.181
Alright,
I want you to start

35:40.312 --> 35:44.446
by finding
the Big Dipper for me.

35:44.577 --> 35:46.622
Um...

35:46.753 --> 35:47.841
I've got it!

35:47.971 --> 35:50.539
You see the handle
and the bowl?

35:50.670 --> 35:52.498
Uh-huh.

35:52.628 --> 35:55.675
Trace a line across
the bottom of the bowl

35:55.805 --> 35:57.198
till you see
a bunch of stars

35:57.329 --> 36:01.246
that look like
a backward question mark.

36:03.248 --> 36:05.685
Oh!
It's Leo the Lion!

36:05.815 --> 36:07.339
I see him.

36:07.469 --> 36:08.688
There's his head.

36:08.818 --> 36:10.342
There you go.

36:10.472 --> 36:12.387
What's that underneath?

36:12.518 --> 36:13.997
The really bright one.

36:14.128 --> 36:16.217
Is it a planet?

36:16.348 --> 36:18.001
You know what?

36:18.132 --> 36:21.440
That might just be
Jupiter.

36:21.570 --> 36:23.224
Wow.

36:23.355 --> 36:25.705
I think Jupiter
is my favorite.

36:25.835 --> 36:28.882
Did you know it's the largest
planet in our solar system?

36:29.012 --> 36:30.884
Is it?
Bigger than the Earth?

36:31.014 --> 36:33.495
Uh-huh.
It's called a gas giant.

36:33.626 --> 36:35.889
Ohh.

36:36.019 --> 36:37.586
Now,
that's not very nice.

36:37.717 --> 36:41.024
Pop-Pop!
It's notthat kind of gas.

36:41.155 --> 36:43.418
Oh, oh, my mistake.

36:43.549 --> 36:44.680
What's next?

36:44.811 --> 36:46.160
Hey. Almost bedtime.

36:46.291 --> 36:47.422
Let's say good night.

36:47.553 --> 36:49.076
But, Mom...Hey, hey, hey.

36:49.207 --> 36:51.165
You do
what your mother says.

36:51.296 --> 36:54.081
The stars will still be
in the sky tomorrow night.

36:54.212 --> 36:56.823
I promise. Okay.

36:56.953 --> 36:58.216
Good night, Pop-Pop.

36:58.346 --> 36:59.434
Love you!

37:01.610 --> 37:04.352
Love you, baby.

37:04.483 --> 37:07.225
Thanks for doing this,
Mike.

37:09.183 --> 37:10.793
How's Chattanooga?

37:10.924 --> 37:13.753
Oh, it's...fine.

37:13.883 --> 37:16.146
I'm, uh...

37:16.277 --> 37:19.498
going to have to stay here
longer than I expected.

37:19.628 --> 37:20.977
Really?

37:21.108 --> 37:24.372
Well, I hope
they're paying you overtime.

37:24.503 --> 37:26.896
They're making it
worth my while.

37:27.027 --> 37:29.377
That's good to hear.

37:31.205 --> 37:33.120
G'night, Pop.

37:33.251 --> 37:35.035
Good night, dear.

37:35.165 --> 37:37.298
Same time tomorrow?

37:37.429 --> 37:39.909
Wouldn't miss it
for the world.

38:42.102 --> 38:44.409
We didn't miss anything.

39:02.775 --> 39:06.126
Hey, let's go out.

39:07.649 --> 39:09.129
Out where?

39:12.654 --> 39:14.482
Omaha Beach.

39:55.349 --> 39:58.570
Here's to tomorrow.

39:58.700 --> 40:00.093
Tomorrow.

40:23.290 --> 40:24.813
Hey. You got this.

40:24.944 --> 40:26.336
Alright?
Today is our day.

40:26.467 --> 40:28.904
Victory in Santa Fe,
victory in Albuquerque.

40:29.035 --> 40:30.515
That sounds good.

40:30.645 --> 40:32.168
Don't worry about anything
except for your pitch. Okay?

40:32.299 --> 40:35.084
I'll record the whole show,
and we can listen to it later.

40:35.215 --> 40:37.652
It's a date.

40:42.875 --> 40:46.182
Hm.

40:46.313 --> 40:48.141
I'm sorry. I don't think
we have it, sir.

40:48.271 --> 40:51.274
Ah. You do.
I'm looking at it.

40:51.405 --> 40:53.755
It's the wood box.
Upper left.

40:53.886 --> 40:57.324
Oh! Right you are.

40:57.455 --> 41:00.893
I didn't realize
we had any left.

41:02.764 --> 41:04.505
Gotta warn you, though,
it's on the pricey side.

41:04.636 --> 41:05.898
$495 for the bottle.

41:06.028 --> 41:07.987
And worth every penny.

41:08.117 --> 41:09.815
Oh, you've had it
before?

41:09.945 --> 41:11.120
'Cause I was gonna let you know
about the stopper here.

41:11.251 --> 41:12.295
It's pretty sharp.

41:12.426 --> 41:13.862
Thanks.
I'll be careful.

41:13.993 --> 41:16.691
Alright.
Well, drink it in good health.

41:22.001 --> 41:25.091
Thanks. Come again.
Can I help you, sir?

41:25.221 --> 41:28.964
I think you're holding
a bottle for me -- Casimiro.

41:29.095 --> 41:30.879
Let me take a look.

41:37.320 --> 41:38.713
It's all paid for.

41:38.844 --> 41:41.194
Great. Thank you.

41:41.324 --> 41:43.892
Enjoy.Thanks.

41:51.030 --> 41:53.902
Fuuuuuck! Unh!

42:09.701 --> 42:12.660
Ultimately,
it's about equal justice.

42:12.791 --> 42:15.794
A system that works
for everyone.

42:15.924 --> 42:19.058
A justice system
that works for everyone.

42:19.188 --> 42:21.495
And what is more important
than that?

42:21.626 --> 42:23.453
It --

42:25.368 --> 42:26.761
Hey, Jimmy. Flag on the play.

42:26.892 --> 42:28.415
Uh, you're not gonna
believe this,

42:28.546 --> 42:30.025
but I just
ran into Casimiro.

42:30.156 --> 42:31.810
The real one.Oh, God.

42:31.940 --> 42:34.029
Yeah, and before you ask,
he didn't shave his mustache...

42:34.160 --> 42:36.945
He broke his arm.Are you serious?

42:37.076 --> 42:40.688
The guy has a giant cast
on his left arm.

42:40.819 --> 42:42.429
And I just checked
all the pictures,

42:42.560 --> 42:44.953
and you can see his arm
in every single one of them.

42:45.084 --> 42:46.433
No cast. Clear as day.

42:46.564 --> 42:48.478
S-S-Shit.

42:48.609 --> 42:51.264
Shit! I know! I know!

42:51.394 --> 42:53.135
Uh, but, hey, hey, hey.

42:53.266 --> 42:56.225
Look at it this way --
if -- if I hadn't seen him,

42:56.356 --> 42:58.967
I mean, that really --
that really could've sunk us.

42:59.098 --> 43:00.621
Right?

43:00.752 --> 43:03.015
So, we're gonna
pull the plug,

43:03.145 --> 43:07.236
and we are going to live
to fight another day.

43:07.367 --> 43:10.065
What other day? Um, we'll figure it out.

43:10.196 --> 43:11.763
I promise. Okay?

43:11.893 --> 43:14.330
Just go.
Just do your thing in Santa Fe.

43:14.461 --> 43:16.942
And we'll re-group
when you get home tonight.

43:21.816 --> 43:24.819
Kim?
Kim, are you still there?

43:24.950 --> 43:26.691
Yes.

43:26.821 --> 43:29.955
W-- Did you hear
what I said?

43:33.045 --> 43:35.264
It happens today.

43:48.713 --> 43:51.890
On the mid-season finale
of "Better Call Saul"...

43:55.720 --> 43:57.939
We need
home court advantage.

43:58.070 --> 44:01.116
I'm gonna figure out
what the hell's happening.

44:01.247 --> 44:02.727
Howie!

44:02.857 --> 44:05.686
Seize the day, carpe diem,
don't live with regret.

44:05.817 --> 44:07.819
Go!
Action!
