00:01.887 --> 00:04.526
<i>Previously on Stargate Atlantis :</i>

00:05.567 --> 00:07.046
You have some Wraith DNA.

00:07.207 --> 00:09.243
My father told people
that it was a gift.

00:09.407 --> 00:12.160
l could help my people by warning
of the Wraiths’approach.

00:12.327 --> 00:15.319
No matter how many Wraith ships
they destroyed, more kept coming.

00:15.487 --> 00:18.365
You think Teyla might tap
into this Wraith psychic network ?

00:18.527 --> 00:19.596
If she can...

00:19.807 --> 00:22.560
... we’Il be able gather all the intel
we needed about them.

00:22.727 --> 00:25.605
l would not consider asking you
to do this if l didn’t think...

00:25.767 --> 00:27.837
... it could provide us
with vital information.

00:28.007 --> 00:32.205
And Dr. Beckett will remain on hand
at all times to monitor your physiology.

00:32.366 --> 00:33.846
l am on a ship...

00:38.407 --> 00:41.046
You are all so pathetic.

01:05.486 --> 01:07.557
« Shotgun, » is it ?

01:07.727 --> 01:09.479
Come on.

01:10.887 --> 01:13.242
Don’t know why l have to do this.

01:21.007 --> 01:22.520
What ?

01:23.167 --> 01:24.282
Nobody said anything.

01:24.487 --> 01:25.522
You don’t have to.

01:25.687 --> 01:28.997
It’s not my fault things are hard to find
on the bottom of the ocean.

01:29.167 --> 01:30.919
Rodney, you said you knew
where it was.

01:31.087 --> 01:35.558
l said l knew its last known location.
It is a mobile drilling station, remember ?

01:35.727 --> 01:38.241
- That’s gonna take a few hours.
- If we don’t find it...

01:38.407 --> 01:41.683
- ... this will be your last known location.
- Oh, zing.

01:41.847 --> 01:44.281
Okay, kids, do l have
to pull this thing over ?

01:44.767 --> 01:48.555
It’s hard enough being in this damn thing
for hours without listening to you guys.

01:48.767 --> 01:52.555
Dr. McKay has managed to narrow the
search field to a remarkably small area.

01:52.927 --> 01:56.078
Finally, a voice of reason.
Thank you, Dr...

01:56.287 --> 01:57.686
- Graydon.
- Yes, yes, of course.

01:57.887 --> 02:00.117
Well, welcome to the team.

02:00.287 --> 02:02.562
l’ve been here almost eight months.

02:02.727 --> 02:04.080
Really ?

02:05.887 --> 02:09.003
It’s been that long, has it ?
Time certainly flies.

02:09.167 --> 02:12.125
Unless you’re in a Jumper,
looking for a needle in a haystack.

02:12.287 --> 02:13.322
You know what ? Shut up.

02:13.487 --> 02:16.479
- You know what ? You shut up.
- l don’t hear Grayson complaining.

02:16.647 --> 02:18.877
It’s Graydon, with a » D. »

02:19.087 --> 02:20.440
What ? You sure ?

02:20.647 --> 02:22.524
It’s my name.

02:23.527 --> 02:26.519
No, l could’ve sworn the guy
l wanted was called Grayson.

02:26.687 --> 02:29.918
Because l remember thinking
« Dick Grayson, » Bruce Wayne’s ward.

02:30.087 --> 02:31.645
Well, it’s Graydon.

02:33.847 --> 02:36.281
Guess that means
l hired the wrong guy.

02:37.287 --> 02:39.278
Well, still glad you came ?

02:40.727 --> 02:45.403
Oh, sorry. l was preoccupied thinking
about the geothermal drilling platform.

02:45.607 --> 02:47.325
It shouldn’t take us much longer.

02:47.487 --> 02:49.079
We just passed a thermal layer.

02:49.247 --> 02:52.080
l’m getting some readings
a couple of hundred feet ahead.

02:52.247 --> 02:55.364
If we did manage to find an alternate
and limitless power supply...

02:55.527 --> 02:58.485
... well, that would make
even this insufferably long search...

02:58.647 --> 02:59.636
... seem worthwhile.

03:01.407 --> 03:03.875
Okay, kids, we’re here.

03:05.647 --> 03:11.005
Well, hopefully it won’t take too much
longer to power up this station.

03:21.767 --> 03:23.519
That wasn’t so hard.

03:23.687 --> 03:26.565
All l gotta do is dock this thing...

03:26.727 --> 03:29.400
... and we can find out
what this place is all about.

04:49.687 --> 04:52.963
All systems are online
and functioning at full capacity.

04:53.127 --> 04:54.924
You mean
we’re generating power already ?

04:55.087 --> 04:57.647
Well, no, but we probably
could if we wanted to.

04:57.807 --> 05:00.844
No, slow down. The Ancients
abandoned this project for a reason.

05:01.007 --> 05:04.761
Let’s try to find out what that reason
might be before we start drilling.

05:04.927 --> 05:07.236
Yes, well, fair enough.

05:22.887 --> 05:24.798
Have we not been down
this hallway before ?

05:24.967 --> 05:26.764
Every corridor looks the same.

05:26.927 --> 05:29.395
Don’t worry, l have
an uncanny sense of direction.

05:29.567 --> 05:31.842
l think she’s right.
We’ve been down this way.

05:32.007 --> 05:35.397
That’s impossible. We took a left
and a left and then a right.

05:35.567 --> 05:37.842
Hey, look, all l’m saying is--

05:39.047 --> 05:40.162
What ?

05:40.607 --> 05:43.041
l’m sensing a Wraith presence nearby.

05:43.647 --> 05:46.286
Are you sure ?
We’re pretty deep underwater.

05:47.607 --> 05:52.044
l cannot be certain, but l believe
it is onboard the drilling platform.

05:57.167 --> 05:59.078
This is Sheppard.

05:59.247 --> 06:03.604
Everyone drop what you’re doing, get
back to the control room immediately.

06:03.807 --> 06:05.763
We did a complete life signs scan.

06:05.927 --> 06:08.157
The first thing we did
when we stepped aboard.

06:08.327 --> 06:10.887
Look, l promise you,
there is nobody here but us.

06:11.047 --> 06:12.275
No, Rodney.

06:12.447 --> 06:15.519
- And l’m sensing it even closer now.
- Maybe it’s the pressure.

06:15.727 --> 06:18.958
- It’s known to do things to the mind.
- Just humor me and check again.

06:26.487 --> 06:30.162
There. All of these life signs
have been accounted for.

06:30.327 --> 06:31.362
Humored ?

06:32.047 --> 06:35.642
Wraith don’t show up on life signs
detectors if they’re hibernating.

06:35.807 --> 06:38.719
- l know what l’m sensing.
- There is no Wraith, l’m telling you.

06:38.887 --> 06:41.196
- Has your sense ever been wrong ?
- Never.

06:41.367 --> 06:43.517
And l cannot shake this feeling.

06:43.687 --> 06:45.757
- l trust her.
- As opposed to irrefutable fact ?

06:45.927 --> 06:47.883
- Machines don’t know.
- Never said they did.

06:48.047 --> 06:50.277
There is a way for me to be sure.

06:50.447 --> 06:53.439
If l can reach out with my mind
and establish a link--

06:53.607 --> 06:55.996
- That’s a little reckless.
- If there is no Wraith...

06:56.167 --> 06:59.477
... then there will be no mind for me to
link with and therefore no risk.

06:59.647 --> 07:01.285
But if there is a Wraith nearby...

07:01.447 --> 07:02.800
We need to know.

07:09.407 --> 07:11.841
- l’m ready.
- You sure ?

07:12.007 --> 07:15.317
The briefest contact will determine
whether or not l’m right.

07:15.487 --> 07:18.206
That’s all we need,
so don’t stick around any longer.

07:18.367 --> 07:21.962
And we will bring you out of it
at the first sign of trouble.

07:24.447 --> 07:26.517
- Just to be sure--
- It’s already set to stun.

07:30.007 --> 07:31.565
Sorry.

08:07.567 --> 08:09.159
Teyla ?

08:14.127 --> 08:17.005
l was mistaken.

08:17.807 --> 08:18.956
There is nothing there.

08:19.127 --> 08:21.402
Now, that’s good.

08:22.007 --> 08:24.521
- l’m sorry.
- No reason to be sorry.

08:25.567 --> 08:28.240
Perhaps it was the effect of
the pressure at this depth.

08:28.407 --> 08:31.604
<i>Well, if you’ve ever seen The Abyss,
pressure can make you nuts.</i>

08:32.447 --> 08:33.765
Not that l think you’re nuts.

08:34.366 --> 08:36.119
It’s all right, John.

08:36.287 --> 08:37.561
l’m relieved.

08:37.727 --> 08:39.126
So am l.

08:39.287 --> 08:41.596
Well, we have a lot of exploring to do.

08:41.767 --> 08:42.756
We ?

08:42.927 --> 08:46.124
Until Rodney delivers the preliminary
status report, l’m all yours.

08:46.287 --> 08:47.606
Put me to work, colonel.

08:47.767 --> 08:50.156
All right, let’s make up some time.
Break into teams.

08:50.327 --> 08:52.761
Ronon, you’re with Teyla.
Élizabeth, you’re with me...

08:52.927 --> 08:55.122
... or l’m with you,
however you wanna put it.

08:55.287 --> 08:58.484
Either way or either way.

09:04.167 --> 09:06.158
That was weird.

09:06.647 --> 09:09.684
Well, we are at the very bottom
of the ocean.

09:09.847 --> 09:13.522
Maybe you’re right, Teyla’s just
experiencing the effects of the pressure.

09:13.687 --> 09:17.043
<i>Hopefully not as bad as that guy
in The Abyss.</i>

09:18.167 --> 09:20.158
This place is big, huh ?

09:24.767 --> 09:26.439
What’s wrong ?

09:26.687 --> 09:30.157
- Nothing. Why ?
- You just haven’t said a word.

09:30.647 --> 09:31.716
Have l not ?

09:32.447 --> 09:33.960
No.

09:34.127 --> 09:37.563
Has my silence made you
uncomfortable ?

09:37.967 --> 09:39.525
No.

09:41.687 --> 09:44.838
Your friendship is very important
to me.

09:46.087 --> 09:48.760
l would hate to do anything
that made you...

09:48.927 --> 09:50.838
... uncomfortable.

09:51.007 --> 09:53.202
Okay. Well, l’m good.

10:35.247 --> 10:37.681
Rodney ? What’s going on ?

10:37.847 --> 10:40.645
<i>- What do you mean what’s going on ?
-We just lost the lights.</i>

10:40.807 --> 10:42.240
What ?

10:48.527 --> 10:50.916
<i>- You’re right.
-Yes, we can see that.</i>

10:51.087 --> 10:53.043
We lost power to 40 percent
of the station.

10:53.207 --> 10:55.926
Sensors are currently off-line.
Zelenka, what’re you doing ?

10:56.087 --> 10:57.725
What do you mean, what am l doing ?

10:57.887 --> 10:59.764
<i>Have you lost power where you are ?</i>

10:59.927 --> 11:01.440
No, have you ?

11:01.607 --> 11:03.643
<i>- No.
-We have.</i>

11:03.807 --> 11:05.365
l wanna know what’s going on.

11:05.527 --> 11:08.405
<i>This station has been lying
idle down here for a few millennia.</i>

11:08.567 --> 11:09.761
<i>Bound to blow a few fuses.</i>

11:09.927 --> 11:12.839
Look, l’Il have power back online
in a minute. Just hang tight.

11:14.887 --> 11:18.516
Ronon, Teyla, report your position.

11:22.367 --> 11:24.835
<i>Ronon ? Teyla ? Come in.</i>

11:33.007 --> 11:35.840
<i>Ronon ? Teyla ?</i>

11:40.087 --> 11:43.602
Rodney, we’ve lost contact with Ronon
and Teyla. Do you know their position ?

11:43.767 --> 11:45.485
<i>No. Internal sensors are out.</i>

11:45.647 --> 11:47.877
<i>I have the location
where the power went down.</i>

11:48.047 --> 11:50.641
It’s an auxiliary control area,
search grid six.

11:50.807 --> 11:53.480
<i>The deck that Ronon and Teyla
were exploring.</i>

11:53.807 --> 11:55.320
We’Il meet you there.

11:55.487 --> 11:57.045
Okay, Davidson.

11:57.207 --> 12:00.085
- It’s Dickenson, sir.
- l was in the ballpark. Give me a break.

12:00.247 --> 12:01.362
Get back to the Jumper...

12:01.527 --> 12:05.406
... see if you can use its sensors to locate
our people within the drilling platform.

12:05.567 --> 12:08.127
Graydon, you go with him.

12:26.927 --> 12:28.519
There you are.

12:47.487 --> 12:50.559
- Weapons fire.
- Nine mil. This way.

12:50.767 --> 12:53.998
Oh, yes, let’s race towards
the gunfire.

13:27.327 --> 13:29.522
Ronon, Teyla, come in.

13:38.727 --> 13:40.399
Are you all right ?

13:40.567 --> 13:42.637
- No.
- Did you see who attacked you ?

13:43.487 --> 13:44.522
Yeah, it was Teyla.

13:44.687 --> 13:47.963
- What ? Why ?
- Okay, until we know what’s going on...

13:48.127 --> 13:49.924
... l’d like everyone in one place.

14:02.207 --> 14:05.802
<i>This is Zelenka. Someone has activated
force fields throughout the station.</i>

14:05.967 --> 14:08.481
<i>- Can you make it to the control room ?
-Yes, I think so.</i>

14:08.647 --> 14:11.036
- Do it.
- Doesn’t make sense. What’s she doing ?

14:11.207 --> 14:14.597
You and Élizabeth go to the control
room. Ronon and l will check on Teyla.

14:14.847 --> 14:17.407
- Be careful.
- No kidding.

14:43.087 --> 14:44.679
Drop it.

14:47.287 --> 14:48.879
John.

14:52.087 --> 14:53.315
What the hell’s going on ?

14:54.567 --> 14:56.239
l do not know.

15:02.007 --> 15:04.726
- Rodney, what’s the status ?
- As far from the quo as it gets.

15:04.887 --> 15:07.082
Teyla didn’t just shut down several
key systems.

15:07.247 --> 15:09.477
She scrambled
the existing operating codes.

15:09.967 --> 15:12.083
This is going to take a while.

15:12.407 --> 15:13.556
Can we contact Atlantis ?

15:13.727 --> 15:16.241
The station’s communication is gone.
l can’t patch it.

15:16.407 --> 15:19.205
She’s blown the control crystals,
shut down half the power...

15:19.367 --> 15:21.597
... and set up a series
of emergency force fields.

15:21.767 --> 15:23.405
To what purpose ?

15:23.567 --> 15:26.365
<i>This is Sheppard. We got Teyla.</i>

15:26.527 --> 15:28.757
- And ?
- And nothing.

15:28.927 --> 15:32.044
She has no memory of anything
that happened in the last hour.

15:32.207 --> 15:33.845
We’re on our way to crew quarters.

15:34.007 --> 15:34.996
<i>I’Il meet you there.</i>

15:35.167 --> 15:37.556
Let’s forget restoring
this station to its former glory.

15:37.727 --> 15:40.525
Concentrate on internal sensors
and disabling force fields...

15:40.687 --> 15:42.882
... that are cutting us off
from the Jumper.

15:51.127 --> 15:52.640
Élizabeth, l’m so sorry.

15:52.807 --> 15:54.240
Don’t worry about that.

15:54.407 --> 15:57.046
- How are you feeling now ?
- l’m fine.

15:57.207 --> 16:01.439
But to hear of the damage l caused and
yet to have no memory of my actions...

16:01.647 --> 16:03.444
Just tell us what you do remember.

16:05.127 --> 16:09.598
l was attempting to seek out the Wraith
presence with my mind, and then...

16:10.647 --> 16:11.636
There is a Wraith ?

16:13.087 --> 16:15.396
The most powerful mind
l have ever encountered.

16:18.047 --> 16:20.277
- l tried to shut her out.
- Her ?

16:21.967 --> 16:23.161
Yes.

16:23.327 --> 16:25.045
l believe this Wraith is a queen.

16:25.207 --> 16:29.280
- l hate queens.
- In that brief moment, l sensed...

16:29.807 --> 16:35.484
... great power, the experiences
of many centuries.

16:35.647 --> 16:37.365
Hunger.

16:37.527 --> 16:39.324
And then...

16:39.487 --> 16:41.239
... nothing.

16:41.927 --> 16:45.681
My next memory is of Colonel Sheppard
and Ronon aiming their weapons at me.

16:45.887 --> 16:47.798
There’s a Wraith
on the drilling platform.

16:47.967 --> 16:51.516
Well, if that were the case, why’d she
use Teyla to do all that damage...

16:51.687 --> 16:54.042
... and why didn’t
the detector pick up a signal ?

16:54.207 --> 16:55.401
It doesn’t matter.

16:55.567 --> 16:58.161
- If she’s here, l’Il find her.
- We’Il find her.

16:58.327 --> 16:59.760
l would like to help.

17:04.007 --> 17:05.326
l’m sorry, Teyla.

17:06.047 --> 17:09.357
- But until we can determine what’s--
- Yes, of course.

17:09.527 --> 17:11.518
l understand.

17:16.247 --> 17:19.922
<i>Dickenson. Any progress
on disabling those force fields ?</i>

17:20.087 --> 17:23.159
<i>I’m getting indications that some
of them are going up and down.</i>

17:23.327 --> 17:26.683
<i>-We could use the Jumper’s sensors.
- l’m doing my best, sir.</i>

17:27.487 --> 17:29.955
One of these days,
l’m gonna call him Dr. McCoy.

17:30.127 --> 17:33.597
- l’d love to be there for that.
- The next time he calls me Grayson.

17:33.767 --> 17:35.962
Actually, l know a Grayson.

17:36.727 --> 17:40.561
- There really is a Grayson ?
- Yeah, he’s a damn good scientist too.

17:40.727 --> 17:42.922
l’m surprised McKay didn’t hire him.

17:45.967 --> 17:47.036
Did you do that ?

17:47.207 --> 17:50.119
l don’t know.
But l’m happy to take credit for it.

17:50.687 --> 17:52.564
- Check it out.
- Yeah.

18:24.327 --> 18:25.316
l don’t understand.

18:25.487 --> 18:28.285
What could the Wraith want with an
Ancient drilling platform ?

18:28.447 --> 18:29.800
How did they even get here ?

18:29.967 --> 18:32.845
- l don’t know, maybe on a ship nearby.
- Underwater ?

18:33.007 --> 18:35.396
Who knows ? Teyla’s spidey sense
works for miles.

18:35.567 --> 18:38.365
- Are the external sensors up ?
- Yes, they’re operational.

18:38.527 --> 18:40.518
- They’re to scan the ocean.
- Doesn’t matter.

18:40.687 --> 18:44.362
Coleman, look at the drilling platform’s
external sensors. See what you turn up.

18:44.527 --> 18:47.121
- What am l looking for ?
- Anything.

18:50.167 --> 18:51.919
How are you feeling ?

18:52.927 --> 18:54.360
l’ve never been more ashamed.

18:55.647 --> 18:59.196
- Oh, you can’t blame yourself.
- l should have been more careful.

19:00.807 --> 19:03.765
A Wraith Queen’s mind
is extremely powerful, Teyla.

19:03.927 --> 19:06.725
- You know that better than l do.
- Still.

19:06.927 --> 19:11.478
If my actions while under her control
result in people getting hurt...

19:14.087 --> 19:16.760
If you hadn’t done what you did...

19:17.247 --> 19:19.317
... who knows
what could’ve happened.

19:22.047 --> 19:24.515
At least now we know
what we’re dealing with.

19:25.367 --> 19:28.677
If anything, l should thank you.
l certainly don’t blame you.

19:29.487 --> 19:31.079
l would like to help them find her.

19:31.647 --> 19:33.205
- Teyla.
- There is no risk.

19:33.367 --> 19:35.164
l don’t know that.

19:36.887 --> 19:40.004
Unless you suspect l am still
under her control even now ?

19:41.487 --> 19:44.001
Would l be alone with you if l did ?

19:45.887 --> 19:49.243
Then you think
l am somehow vulnerable to her ?

19:51.767 --> 19:55.203
l think it is best to keep you away
from her for the moment, yes.

19:56.047 --> 19:58.686
Look, l don’t fully understand
this capability you have...

19:58.847 --> 20:02.078
... of linking with a Wraith mind,
but if it’s even remotely possible--

20:02.247 --> 20:06.843
She was only able to control me
because l opened my mind to her.

20:12.007 --> 20:14.316
If l choose to do so again...

20:14.927 --> 20:16.406
... l will be ready.

20:16.567 --> 20:19.798
- Teyla, l know you wanna help.
- l do.

20:20.487 --> 20:24.480
The best way for you to do that is allow
Ronon and Colonel Sheppard to find her.

20:28.367 --> 20:30.198
As you wish.

20:59.007 --> 21:02.317
It’s about time. l was beginning
to think you had gotten lost.

21:02.527 --> 21:04.757
Listen, did you manage to-- ?

21:10.927 --> 21:12.565
Colonel Sheppard.

21:13.207 --> 21:14.640
If you can hear me...

21:14.807 --> 21:16.206
... please.

21:16.367 --> 21:17.595
<i>Help me--</i>

21:17.767 --> 21:20.327
Who am l talking to ?

21:20.487 --> 21:22.557
What’s your location ?

21:23.527 --> 21:24.596
McKay ?

21:24.767 --> 21:26.723
<i>Do you have any men
unaccounted for ?</i>

21:26.887 --> 21:28.718
Two guys l just sent back
to the Jumper.

21:28.887 --> 21:32.118
l think they’re in trouble.
Can you get those force fields down ?

21:33.487 --> 21:35.000
We’re working on it.

21:38.207 --> 21:40.562
The Wraith presence
is even stronger than before.

21:40.727 --> 21:42.843
She is aboard this station.
You must warn them.

21:43.007 --> 21:46.920
Colonel Sheppard, Teyla is certain
the Wraith is aboard the station.

21:47.087 --> 21:48.566
<i>Understood.</i>

21:48.727 --> 21:51.321
Ronon, l’m heading back
to the Jumper. Meet me there.

21:51.487 --> 21:52.886
l’m on my way.

21:55.807 --> 21:59.720
<i>Sheppard, help me. Please.</i>

22:00.607 --> 22:02.598
McKay.

22:06.807 --> 22:08.718
McKay.

22:08.887 --> 22:10.366
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah, almost there.</i>

22:10.767 --> 22:12.883
l can only do one at a time.

22:19.807 --> 22:22.401
The Jumper’s sensors
should be able to locate them.

22:35.487 --> 22:37.000
Graydon ?

22:48.327 --> 22:49.601
Graydon’s dead.

22:50.087 --> 22:53.238
<i>-Fed upon.
- What about Dickenson ?</i>

22:53.407 --> 22:55.284
<i>There’s no sign of him yet.</i>

22:56.327 --> 22:59.524
See if we can find him using the...

23:01.887 --> 23:03.957
Sheppard ?

23:04.127 --> 23:05.276
Sheppard, come in.

23:16.127 --> 23:17.606
You are Sheppard.

23:18.367 --> 23:21.040
The one who can fly this ship.

23:21.887 --> 23:24.276
You will return me to the surface.

23:25.607 --> 23:27.563
Kneel.

23:32.007 --> 23:34.919
<i>Sheppard, this is mcKay.
What have you got ?</i>

23:35.767 --> 23:37.359
<i>Sheppard, can you hear me ?</i>

23:42.727 --> 23:44.718
Is something wrong ?

23:47.087 --> 23:49.601
You will fly me to the stargate...

23:50.327 --> 23:52.238
... and return me to my people.

24:04.167 --> 24:08.718
<i>Sheppard, this is mcKay.
Please respond. Sheppard, come in.</i>

24:08.927 --> 24:10.997
l’m here.

24:12.367 --> 24:14.437
We had to throw the emergency
force fields up.

24:14.607 --> 24:17.041
- The section you were in was flooding.
- l noticed.

24:17.207 --> 24:20.722
You were thrown by the force of the
water clear of the force field bulkhead.

24:20.887 --> 24:22.718
Ronon ?

24:40.447 --> 24:41.436
l missed.

24:41.807 --> 24:44.526
l noticed that too.

24:44.687 --> 24:48.646
<i>Everyone else is accounted for.
Any sign of Dickenson ?</i>

24:50.407 --> 24:52.602
Stand by, McKay.

24:56.127 --> 24:59.881
Look, l don’t know what just happened,
but we are now cut off from the Jumper.

25:00.087 --> 25:02.123
- l won’t miss now.
- Wait.

25:02.287 --> 25:04.084
What for ?

25:04.287 --> 25:07.836
Well, we lost the Jumper and we lost
communications with Atlantis.

25:08.007 --> 25:10.043
Maybe she can help us
get out of this place.

25:19.767 --> 25:20.756
Welcome back.

25:24.847 --> 25:26.997
l trust you’re comfortable ?

25:27.767 --> 25:32.079
That groggy sensation you’re feeling are
the sedatives we’re pumping you full of.

25:32.247 --> 25:34.238
Just a precaution.

25:34.407 --> 25:36.921
As for the other precautions...

25:44.567 --> 25:47.240
Now, you’re gonna tell us everything
we want to know.

25:48.007 --> 25:49.645
In exchange for ?

25:50.927 --> 25:53.122
This is not a negotiation.

25:54.247 --> 25:56.283
l disagree.

25:56.447 --> 25:58.324
Let me get this over with.

26:16.167 --> 26:17.805
How did you get aboard this station ?

26:21.287 --> 26:23.562
Are there any more of you ?

26:27.207 --> 26:30.199
You are all about to die.

26:30.607 --> 26:32.086
Really ?

26:32.247 --> 26:34.886
You care to elaborate on that at all ?

26:43.127 --> 26:46.483
We should keep the force fields up till
Atlantis sends a rescue Jumper.

26:46.647 --> 26:48.524
Station communications
are still down--

26:48.687 --> 26:50.723
If l’d listened to Teyla,
this wouldn’t have happened.

26:50.887 --> 26:53.765
- It’s not your fault.
- l sent those men back to the Jumper.

26:53.927 --> 26:56.646
Well, the sensors indicated that
there was nobody here.

26:56.807 --> 27:00.197
l don’t think there was, sir. The Wraith
arrived after we did the scans.

27:00.367 --> 27:01.595
- What ?
- l did a search...

27:01.807 --> 27:04.275
... with the remote sensors.
l found something.

27:04.887 --> 27:08.402
We didn’t notice it on the way down
because it’s radiating very little EM.

27:08.607 --> 27:12.202
Guys, head back here.
l think l have a few answers.

27:16.127 --> 27:20.245
- A Wraith cruiser ?
- Seems completely buried in silt.

27:20.527 --> 27:23.439
Which means it’s been here
a very, very, very long time.

27:23.607 --> 27:27.998
- Yes, give or take a very.
- That doesn’t explain how she got here.

27:30.047 --> 27:33.517
- Maybe she swam over.
- No, no. The pressure at that depth is--

27:33.687 --> 27:36.121
Deadly to humans,
but she’s not human, remember ?

27:36.287 --> 27:40.360
Yes, it’s difficult to imagine, but with
a Wraith’s ability to heal itself...

27:45.967 --> 27:49.004
- And there are no other Wraith onboard ?
- No way to know for sure.

27:49.207 --> 27:52.916
Our prisoner isn’t talking.
Other than,« ou » ?You’re all about to die. »

27:53.127 --> 27:56.039
Which may or may not
be an empty threat.

27:56.327 --> 27:59.922
- And you have no way of knowing ?
- She said it with a lot of confidence.

28:01.327 --> 28:04.364
- There is a way to find out.
- We’ve already been down that road.

28:04.527 --> 28:06.916
What is to stop her asserting
control over you again ?

28:07.087 --> 28:09.043
She is heavily sedated.

28:09.447 --> 28:12.405
And this time, l know exactly
what l’m dealing with.

28:27.047 --> 28:28.799
You.

28:30.327 --> 28:32.283
l was caught off-guard the first time.

28:32.767 --> 28:34.246
That will not happen again.

28:35.047 --> 28:36.799
It does not matter.

28:36.967 --> 28:39.003
Well, we think it does.

28:39.327 --> 28:41.887
Your fate is sealed.

28:44.887 --> 28:47.526
If you have any reason to suspect
that l’m not myself...

28:47.687 --> 28:49.723
... do not hesitate to use that.

28:49.887 --> 28:50.922
l won’t.

29:05.607 --> 29:06.596
l see her...

29:08.447 --> 29:13.362
<i>... leading the first wave of ships that
attacked Atlantis during the war.</i>

29:13.927 --> 29:16.680
Queen of a great alliance.

29:18.607 --> 29:21.121
Her ship was damaged
during the battle.

29:23.447 --> 29:25.278
It crashed into the ocean.

29:26.327 --> 29:29.319
She fed upon
her own crew to survive.

29:29.487 --> 29:32.559
Too deep to ever swim to the surface.

29:32.727 --> 29:36.197
Waking between centuries...

29:36.887 --> 29:40.084
... waiting for rescue
that never came...

29:40.607 --> 29:44.282
... until finally she was alone.

29:46.727 --> 29:49.958
<i>She sensed our presence
during our descent.</i>

29:51.047 --> 29:52.719
<i>She sensed...</i>

29:53.487 --> 29:54.966
... me.

29:55.607 --> 29:59.566
<i>And saw us as her one chance
at freedom from her prison.</i>

30:02.127 --> 30:05.085
<i>The water was crushing...</i>

30:06.207 --> 30:07.481
... but she was determined.

30:07.967 --> 30:12.438
Finally, after all these millennia,
a ship.

30:13.567 --> 30:15.478
<i>But she did not possess the gene
to fly it.</i>

30:18.647 --> 30:20.922
She used Dickenson to call for me.

30:31.647 --> 30:32.716
Teyla ?

30:33.287 --> 30:36.404
- You are all about to die.
- That does not sound like Teyla.

30:36.567 --> 30:38.478
You are all about to die.

30:38.647 --> 30:39.921
You are all about to die.

30:40.087 --> 30:42.920
- Teyla, snap out of it.
- Wait.

30:48.567 --> 30:52.196
She has activated the self-destruct
device of the Wraith cruiser.

30:52.367 --> 30:55.086
It is set to detonate within two hours.

30:58.167 --> 31:01.955
So not an empty threat.

31:17.247 --> 31:18.600
- How’s Teyla ?
- She’s resting.

31:18.767 --> 31:20.883
It took more out of her
than she’Il admit.

31:21.047 --> 31:23.242
- What’s the news ?
- It looks like the Ancients...

31:23.407 --> 31:25.762
... chose this section
because the planet’s crust...

31:25.927 --> 31:27.645
... is remarkably thin below us...

31:27.807 --> 31:31.402
... allowing to drill into the magma and
maximize the geothermal power output.

31:31.567 --> 31:33.478
- Okay.
- Which means there’s a great deal...

31:33.647 --> 31:36.036
... of potential energy directly
beneath this station.

31:36.207 --> 31:38.596
That’s the news ? That this place
works as advertised ?

31:38.767 --> 31:41.406
No, no, the news is that
if they were to detonate, say...

31:41.567 --> 31:44.843
... the self-destruct of a Wraith cruiser
on such a wafer-thin crust...

31:45.047 --> 31:47.117
- Oh, my God.
- All that thermal energy...

31:47.327 --> 31:50.000
... directly beneath us
will be released all at once.

31:50.207 --> 31:52.243
So bad news.

31:52.407 --> 31:54.637
The explosion will be magnified a
thousand times.

31:54.807 --> 31:57.446
- We’re talking catastrophic.
- So it won’t just be us.

31:57.607 --> 32:00.838
No, Atlantis will be affected as well.
It’s within the blast radius.

32:01.007 --> 32:03.760
- We have no way to warn them ?
- They’d never see it coming.

32:03.927 --> 32:05.997
So we disarm the self-destruct.

32:06.167 --> 32:09.000
- That’s brilliant, we need to get there.
- Without the Jumper ?

32:09.167 --> 32:11.681
We’re behind schedule.
They’Il send a rescue Jumper.

32:11.847 --> 32:14.236
Even if they’ve left,
the moment we were overdue--

32:14.407 --> 32:16.921
- They won’t make it in time.
- How far is the cruiser ?

32:19.727 --> 32:23.197
- Less than a kilometer.
- She swam that far ?

32:23.367 --> 32:26.916
- What is she ?
- A formidable enemy.

32:27.087 --> 32:28.759
l have an idea.

32:30.047 --> 32:32.436
l found these in the database
when we first got here.

32:32.607 --> 32:35.758
They were used to make
repairs to the exterior of the station.

32:35.927 --> 32:39.715
- Very cool.
- You’Il be able to traverse the distance.

32:39.887 --> 32:43.846
- You mean we.
- Yes, of course. We.

32:45.207 --> 32:47.198
This must be how she got in.

32:47.407 --> 32:49.204
Probably.

32:50.767 --> 32:52.803
All right, let’s get suited up.

32:54.327 --> 32:56.079
Right.

33:00.327 --> 33:01.965
You’re breathing too hard.

33:02.607 --> 33:05.280
Forgive me for being aware of exactly
how much pressure...

33:05.447 --> 33:07.403
... is being exerted on this suit
right now.

33:07.567 --> 33:10.798
Just think of it as a walk
on the beach.

33:10.967 --> 33:13.720
A beach that’s about to explode.

33:14.047 --> 33:16.163
That’s supposed
to make me feel better ?

33:16.807 --> 33:20.197
No, it’s supposed to make you walk
faster. We’re on a clock here.

33:20.407 --> 33:22.159
<i>This is Weir. How close are you ?</i>

33:22.367 --> 33:25.359
Almost there, but we’re running
out of time.

33:25.567 --> 33:29.037
We need Teyla to do her
Kreskin act again.

33:30.087 --> 33:33.477
l’d rather not have to. l think it could be
much too dangerous for her.

33:33.687 --> 33:36.042
So is exploding magma.

33:36.767 --> 33:40.442
l am walking as fast as l can.

33:41.567 --> 33:44.286
How do we disarm the self-destruct ?

33:44.727 --> 33:47.525
You won’t survive the blast
any more than we will.

33:50.567 --> 33:52.762
l can get the information we need.

33:52.967 --> 33:55.401
If you were strong enough...

33:55.607 --> 33:58.599
... you would have done so already.

34:00.927 --> 34:04.442
l can feel how weak you are.

34:04.647 --> 34:07.241
We shall see who is stronger.

34:19.887 --> 34:21.842
- That took too long.
- Yeah, well...

34:22.047 --> 34:26.484
... l probably won’t be able to disarm the
self-destruct in time, we’re not in a rush.

34:26.647 --> 34:28.797
Why don’t we find it,
then you can be negative ?

34:28.967 --> 34:30.559
This ship is remarkably preserved.

34:30.726 --> 34:33.161
You’d think after 10,000 years
she’d wanna redecorate.

34:33.327 --> 34:36.797
l’m serious. Hull damage is minimal.
They probably lost their main drive.

34:36.967 --> 34:38.844
You’re saying this is salvageable ?

34:39.007 --> 34:42.522
l have to assess damage to primary
systems, but it’s not out of the question.

34:42.687 --> 34:45.996
You’d just go and blow it up or slam it
into a hive ship or something...

34:46.167 --> 34:48.397
... and all that work
would be for nothing.

34:49.127 --> 34:50.639
This way.

35:02.647 --> 35:04.205
Teyla ?

35:06.927 --> 35:08.883
You are weakening.

35:09.047 --> 35:10.275
l think you should stop.

35:10.447 --> 35:12.438
My concentration slipped
for a moment.

35:12.607 --> 35:15.679
And in that moment, l could have
crushed you with a single thought.

35:17.727 --> 35:21.515
Perhaps next time, l will.

35:21.687 --> 35:24.076
- There isn’t gonna be a next time.
- l’m fine.

35:24.247 --> 35:27.080
No, you’re not. l can see
what this is doing to you.

35:27.247 --> 35:29.886
Let’s just give McKay a chance.

35:33.687 --> 35:35.484
There it is.

35:38.887 --> 35:40.366
What ?

35:40.727 --> 35:44.242
l’m sure this is the device, l’m sure
it says we have less than half an hour.

35:44.407 --> 35:46.238
So turn it off.

35:52.247 --> 35:54.681
- What does that mean ?
- It’s not accepting commands.

35:54.847 --> 35:56.883
There must be some kind
of a command code...

35:57.047 --> 35:59.436
- ... that needs to be entered.
- Can you figure it out ?

35:59.607 --> 36:02.599
Command codes are simple like the
number one or the letter A...

36:02.767 --> 36:05.804
- ... like, in Wraith, which would be--
- Can you figure it out or not ?

36:05.967 --> 36:08.083
Not if l stood and tried
for a million years...

36:08.247 --> 36:11.398
... and we have just under
a million years less than that.

36:11.687 --> 36:13.643
Élizabeth, you there ?

36:14.647 --> 36:15.841
Any luck ?

36:16.047 --> 36:18.038
<i>Negative. We don’t get her
command code...</i>

36:18.247 --> 36:21.364
... in less than 30 minutes,
we’re dead.

36:25.567 --> 36:28.604
- This is the only way.
- l told you, Rodney has another idea.

36:28.807 --> 36:32.243
That may or may not succeed.
There is only one way to be certain.

36:32.407 --> 36:34.557
She said she would kill you next time.

36:34.767 --> 36:36.803
l will not let that happen.

36:37.647 --> 36:40.957
No. We’re gonna give them
more time.

36:48.727 --> 36:49.716
Ronon.

36:50.007 --> 36:53.079
There’s an emergency in the control
room. Dr. Weir needs your help.

36:53.247 --> 36:54.566
What about her ?

36:54.727 --> 36:56.763
l will watch the prisoner. Hurry.

36:56.967 --> 36:58.764
Watch yourself.

37:03.007 --> 37:05.362
Are you fool enough to try again ?

37:07.007 --> 37:08.520
l have very little to lose.

37:52.287 --> 37:55.723
You are trying to hide something
from me.

38:00.047 --> 38:01.605
<i>There’s been a development.</i>

38:01.767 --> 38:03.803
You’ve been able to disarm
the self-destruct ?

38:03.967 --> 38:07.437
No, but Rodney thinks if he can tie in
a Naquadah generator...

38:07.607 --> 38:10.565
- ... he can get the cruiser to fly.
- After all these years ?

38:10.727 --> 38:12.957
Damage was superficial.
Problem was the engines.

38:13.127 --> 38:15.118
McKay’s restored power and l think...

38:15.287 --> 38:18.324
- ... l can fly the ship to a distance.
- That’s a suicide mission.

38:18.487 --> 38:22.366
If l can ditch the ship on the mainland,
maybe l can get far enough away.

38:22.527 --> 38:23.960
- l gotta go now.
- Wait.

38:24.127 --> 38:26.721
Let me try again. If l can get her to give
up her code...

38:26.887 --> 38:30.084
- ... you won’t have to risk it.
- You’re in no condition to do that.

38:30.967 --> 38:32.480
Sorry.

39:01.527 --> 39:02.880
Well.

39:03.087 --> 39:05.681
You’re a hell of a swimmer,
l’Il give you that.

39:05.887 --> 39:08.640
You have restored power ?

39:08.927 --> 39:10.645
It’Il fly.

39:19.367 --> 39:22.962
You shall be rewarded
with a quick death.

39:29.247 --> 39:31.203
She’s not dying
according to plan here.

39:38.447 --> 39:40.039
l thought you’d forgotten about me.

39:40.207 --> 39:42.482
l just had to wait for her
to disable the device.

39:42.647 --> 39:46.162
Be thankful she didn’t feed on you
before she entered the command code.

39:46.327 --> 39:48.318
- That’s why you didn’t wanna be bait.
- No...

39:48.487 --> 39:51.604
... you had to be bait because she was
expecting you to fly the ship.

39:56.007 --> 39:59.044
- She is dead, right ?
- Let’s get out of here.

40:11.087 --> 40:12.884
How are you feeling ?

40:13.127 --> 40:17.359
Much better, now that l no longer
feel the constant presence of a Wraith.

40:17.607 --> 40:21.156
That was no ordinary Wraith. It took
a lot of bullets to take her down.

40:21.527 --> 40:22.596
l wish l was there.

40:22.767 --> 40:27.966
He’s right, you know. l mean, deceiving
a Wraith Queen ? That’s no small feat.

40:28.167 --> 40:31.523
When there are so many lives at stake,
it’s easy to summon the strength.

40:31.687 --> 40:35.202
Well, Zelenka’s finally got
communications back up.

40:35.367 --> 40:37.881
Turns out Atlantis
had sent another Jumper.

40:38.087 --> 40:40.681
- It should be here within the hour.
- That’s good news.

40:40.887 --> 40:43.037
Yeah, no kidding.
l can’t wait to see the sun.

40:43.207 --> 40:45.596
We haven’t finished what we came for.
Wraith’s gone.

40:45.767 --> 40:46.916
We got a ton of research.

40:47.087 --> 40:49.726
- Yes, we do.
- In fact, l’m sure we should be able...

40:49.887 --> 40:53.675
... to come up with a way to get auxiliary
power online in a couple of days.

40:54.527 --> 40:55.676
Is he serious ?

40:55.887 --> 40:58.526
- Yeah, he is.
- Well, l for one...

40:58.687 --> 41:01.804
... intend to spend
the next little while resting.

41:02.247 --> 41:03.475
Same here.

41:03.687 --> 41:06.838
Yeah. Same here.
