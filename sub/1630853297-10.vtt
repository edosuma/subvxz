ANNOUNCER: And the winner is...

55:23.189 --> 55:26.323
The finale was by far the
most difficult episode to write

55:26.453 --> 55:29.282
because everyone
knows how it ends up.

55:29.413 --> 55:31.023
We know that it
went on to become

55:31.153 --> 55:33.242
one of the most iconic
films of all time.

55:33.373 --> 55:34.722
This is gonna be huge, Ruddy.

55:34.853 --> 55:35.680
I know it.

55:36.768 --> 55:38.552
NIKKI: The onus
of crafting Episode 10

55:38.683 --> 55:41.163
was in our character stories,

55:41.294 --> 55:42.730
the journeys that we had taken

55:42.861 --> 55:46.081
with Al Ruddy and Robert
Evans and Bettye McCartt.

55:46.865 --> 55:49.084
We tried to use both
the Academy Awards

55:49.389 --> 55:51.783
and the premiere to exploit

55:51.913 --> 55:53.915
what the characters
were experiencing

55:54.046 --> 55:57.005
in the final leg
of their journey in The Offer.

55:57.832 --> 55:58.790
To The Godfather.

56:05.710 --> 56:08.365
How do you recreate the Oscars?

56:08.495 --> 56:11.324
Eleven fucking nominations.

56:11.629 --> 56:13.457
ADAM:
We were not gonna be filling up

56:13.587 --> 56:17.504
the Dorothy Chandler
Pavilion with 1,500 extras

56:17.635 --> 56:19.506
and yet, the Oscars had to be

56:19.637 --> 56:22.422
a very important
chapter in that story.

56:22.553 --> 56:23.554
Oscar changes everything.

56:23.684 --> 56:24.816
This is your moment.

56:24.946 --> 56:27.122
ADAM: Finding, you know,
cinematic ways

56:27.471 --> 56:28.950
of honoring
the importance of that

56:29.081 --> 56:31.692
and what that represented
to all of the characters

56:32.127 --> 56:33.215
felt very important.

56:33.607 --> 56:35.653
There was some
really interesting

56:35.783 --> 56:37.742
and sort of abstract
film choices

56:37.872 --> 56:40.266
made to do that,
that I think the audience

56:40.397 --> 56:41.572
will have fun with.

56:42.050 --> 56:43.051
I told you once,

56:43.617 --> 56:45.053
some people have brains,

56:45.184 --> 56:46.794
some people have balls.

56:46.925 --> 56:47.926
But you have both.

56:48.492 --> 56:52.452
I think Al remains
true to himself

56:52.583 --> 56:57.283
and it never was about
chasing any sort of accolade.

56:57.414 --> 56:58.415
It's our movie, Bob.

56:58.763 --> 57:00.286
It's your name on
the poster, pal.

57:00.417 --> 57:03.768
MILES: You know, he had put
so much into The Godfather

57:04.203 --> 57:06.727
and that went beyond his,
I think, wildest dreams

57:06.858 --> 57:08.773
of how well it all turned out.

57:08.903 --> 57:10.557
But he was also a writer.

57:10.688 --> 57:11.732
BETTYE: A treatment?

57:11.863 --> 57:13.430
MILES: You know,
with The Longest Yard.

57:13.560 --> 57:15.040
By Albert S. Ruddy?

57:15.170 --> 57:16.607
ADAM: It was important to me

57:16.737 --> 57:18.609
that we leave feeling that Al

57:18.739 --> 57:21.220
was making the right choice
for him.

57:21.350 --> 57:22.526
AL: It was a hard choice to make

57:22.656 --> 57:24.963
but it's the only one
I could live with.

57:25.354 --> 57:27.008
ADAM: It was challenging in that

57:27.139 --> 57:30.795
you have this kind of
celebratory final destination

57:30.925 --> 57:33.319
for the company
and it becomes clear

57:33.450 --> 57:35.756
that for whatever
his personal reasons,

57:35.887 --> 57:38.585
that Al feels that his destiny
is somewhere else.

57:39.020 --> 57:40.761
AL: You took a chance on
me when no one else would

57:40.892 --> 57:42.502
and I will never forget that.

57:42.633 --> 57:44.373
But this is
something I gotta do.

57:44.765 --> 57:46.463
ANTHONY: Other than
the obvious of, you know,

57:46.593 --> 57:48.769
being able to see
behind the scenes
and how cool that is.

57:48.900 --> 57:51.206
I think really what
the story is about largely,

57:51.337 --> 57:54.558
is a person who was
devoted to telling a story

57:54.688 --> 57:55.646
that they really cared about

57:57.212 --> 57:58.736
and the lengths
that they went to,
to make it happen.

57:59.040 --> 58:00.520
I told you we got it.

58:00.651 --> 58:01.739
We got it.

58:01.869 --> 58:04.437
It took so much scrappiness.

58:04.568 --> 58:07.266
It took so much
dedication, ingenuity,

58:07.396 --> 58:08.528
to make The Godfather.

58:08.659 --> 58:10.008
ROBERT: Let's enjoy this moment

58:10.661 --> 58:11.705
because the world
will never forget it.

58:13.402 --> 58:14.926
MEREDITH: It's one of
the most pivotal moments
in cinema history.

58:15.056 --> 58:19.234
And I'm so honored to be a
very small, but passionate part

58:19.365 --> 58:20.540
of the storytelling.

58:21.498 --> 58:22.934
ANTHONY:
I think now is such a great time

58:23.064 --> 58:24.675
to share that kind
of a story of a man

58:24.805 --> 58:27.242
who was so inspired and
went to such great lengths

58:27.373 --> 58:30.028
to make something that almost
seemed impossible happen.

58:30.158 --> 58:32.770
Hopefully that inspires
other people
and other filmmakers

58:32.900 --> 58:34.162
to do the same type of thing.

MILES: The guy,
he just doesn't stop.

58:41.735 --> 58:43.520
He's really relentless,
and I think

58:43.650 --> 58:46.479
the fact that he was
able to walk away

58:46.610 --> 58:48.873
of the rainbow at the end...

58:50.396 --> 58:51.702
This is just the start.

58:51.832 --> 58:53.965
We'll do it all over again
with Godfather Part Two.

58:54.095 --> 58:56.794
MILES: Just being
comfortable enough
with himself in his career

58:56.924 --> 58:59.013
to be able to walk
away from what he knew

58:59.448 --> 59:00.493
would be a huge smash.

59:00.798 --> 59:02.626
That says a lot about the man.

ALBERT: I'm really proud
to be in this business.

59:06.978 --> 59:08.153
I really am.

59:08.283 --> 59:09.284
It means a lot to me.

59:10.547 --> 59:11.765
When I got my Academy Award
on The Godfather,

59:12.200 --> 59:14.333
I said,
"Everyone sitting out there,

who dreams this kinda
thing can happen,
