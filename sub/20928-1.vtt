00:13.560 --> 00:15.200
'Hi, Debbie.

00:15.200 --> 00:16.760
'It's Simon here.

00:18.480 --> 00:20.840
'I know we've had our ups and downs,

00:20.840 --> 00:25.480
'but I really do appreciate everything you've done for me.'

00:30.600 --> 00:31.720
Up!

00:33.640 --> 00:36.480
'I've been phenomenally lucky.

00:36.480 --> 00:39.520
'Such a loving family.

00:39.520 --> 00:42.280
'So many wonderful friends.

00:46.360 --> 00:48.000
'I will miss it all.'

00:56.520 --> 01:00.760
We will perhaps never know the full nature of

01:00.760 --> 01:03.560
Simon's thoughts on life and death.

01:03.560 --> 01:08.960
I suspect they were as complex and interesting as the man himself.

01:17.920 --> 01:22.880
The toll that his disease took seems cruel.

01:33.360 --> 01:35.200
The law is very clear.

01:35.200 --> 01:37.720
In this country, we can't help people end their lives.

01:42.640 --> 01:45.680
Everybody can change mind,

01:45.680 --> 01:47.520
right in the last moment.

01:51.240 --> 01:55.480
'I feel so strongly inside that this isn't the right thing to do.

01:57.800 --> 02:01.440
'He's still really, really enjoying life.'

02:10.160 --> 02:13.720
'If he goes to Switzerland, there is a price to be paid by other

02:13.720 --> 02:17.080
'people and they may not be that happy to pay it.'

02:21.040 --> 02:23.000
'How he dies is so important.

02:23.000 --> 02:27.120
'For our children, for his sisters, his mother.'

02:30.360 --> 02:34.040
However final it might feel to you now,

02:34.040 --> 02:39.240
today is not the last word for Simon.

02:59.760 --> 03:01.320
This is our lovely room.

03:04.360 --> 03:05.760
Huh!

03:05.760 --> 03:09.520
Have you enjoyed your day in the mountains, Simon?

03:11.520 --> 03:13.960
Has it been frustrating, not being able to speak?

03:16.640 --> 03:18.400
But you had a nice time?

03:21.720 --> 03:23.240
Good.

03:24.840 --> 03:28.400
You know, it's your 14th wedding anniversary today.

03:30.000 --> 03:31.360
How does that make you feel?

03:35.560 --> 03:40.080
Happy anniversary to Debbie and Simon.

03:40.080 --> 03:43.600
Simon, I've zoomed in, I can see you really well!

03:45.080 --> 03:48.320
'We've been married 14 years and we've just had such fun together.'

03:48.320 --> 03:50.520
Aah! Simon!

03:50.520 --> 03:54.240
'He's like a little boy, in some ways!

03:54.240 --> 03:56.800
'But I like his energy.

03:56.800 --> 04:01.320
'I like the fact life seems very alive when he's there.'

04:07.440 --> 04:14.040
'He just makes every day just brighter and puts colour in life.

04:18.160 --> 04:24.040
'Six months ago, we got this diagnosis, motor neurone disease.

04:24.040 --> 04:28.680
'Terminal illness. Between six months and two years.'

04:28.680 --> 04:33.120
They can't do anything at all to slow the illness down

04:33.120 --> 04:36.640
or to change the prognosis, there is nothing at all, nothing.

04:39.360 --> 04:40.960
Grandad...

04:40.960 --> 04:44.000
'Roman, Roman, Roman.

04:44.000 --> 04:47.200
'Come here, I have got something to show you.'

04:47.200 --> 04:49.800
Did you hear that? Grandad's got something to show you.

04:49.800 --> 04:51.160
'You are a silly boy.'

04:52.600 --> 04:56.160
- No!
- 'You are a silly boy.'
- Top banana!

04:57.560 --> 04:59.280
'Top banana. Happy days.'

04:59.280 --> 05:00.720
Top banana, happy days!

05:00.720 --> 05:05.240
SIMON LAUGHS Top banana, happy days!

05:12.480 --> 05:16.120
'This machine is slow and frustrating

05:16.120 --> 05:18.920
'for a man of my immense intellect.'

05:27.360 --> 05:32.280
'For a man of my immense intellect and Cambridge education,

05:32.280 --> 05:36.240
'even though I only got a third-class degree.'

05:38.880 --> 05:43.600
'Third-class degree is a gentleman's degree that shows healthy

05:43.600 --> 05:45.920
'interest in other things.'

05:45.920 --> 05:47.760
Exactly.

05:47.760 --> 05:50.360
Ha! Exactly.

05:50.360 --> 05:54.200
'For Simon, who's a fantastic communicator, very amusing,

05:54.200 --> 05:58.200
'very quick-witted, if you could take something away from him

05:58.200 --> 06:01.480
'that would be the worst possible thing, it would be his voice.'

06:01.480 --> 06:03.320
'Dratted disease!'

06:03.320 --> 06:05.720
'People talk to me and not to him.'

06:05.720 --> 06:09.080
I don't want to take over, so it's quite a difficult balance between

06:09.080 --> 06:12.800
feeling quite protective, and I know my daughter Hannah does, as well.

06:12.800 --> 06:16.040
People always commented on your Northern accent,

06:16.040 --> 06:19.000
it's not something I really noticed at all.

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
Um, but I probably just didn't care.

06:21.000 --> 06:23.480
Or maybe I wasn't listening most of the time!

06:23.480 --> 06:27.360
Christmas, December 2013.

06:27.360 --> 06:30.960
Will you give me a little kissy now?

06:30.960 --> 06:33.480
- Urgh!
- Just give me a little kiss...

06:34.560 --> 06:37.120
- OK, here we go.
- Yay!

06:38.800 --> 06:40.200
And what's this one?

06:40.200 --> 06:43.920
What's this one? What noise does it make?

06:43.920 --> 06:45.200
Yay!

06:45.200 --> 06:47.040
Yay!

07:26.880 --> 07:29.880
That's my little baby, at home in Leeds.

07:33.400 --> 07:37.720
There he is, now, that shows what he's going to be like, doesn't it?

07:37.720 --> 07:39.240
A laugh.

07:41.560 --> 07:47.520
Simon was only ever off school two days, he never got ill.

07:47.520 --> 07:51.760
It's come as a great shock to all of us, really.

07:51.760 --> 07:54.960
Sometimes, I wake up and it's absolutely dreadful

07:54.960 --> 07:57.920
and I think, now, how much must he be waking up

07:57.920 --> 08:01.640
thinking that he's got another thing that's not working?

08:10.240 --> 08:11.280
I mean...

08:36.240 --> 08:38.080
'Ever had a moment

08:38.080 --> 08:41.320
'when you realise just how much you care about the things you own?'

08:51.200 --> 08:53.240
'When it comes to a cooked breakfast,

08:53.240 --> 08:55.040
'some people pick and pack.'

09:00.240 --> 09:03.200
'Reducing our food waste by half could have the same

09:03.200 --> 09:07.200
'effect on CO2 emissions as taking thousands of cars off the road.'

09:13.600 --> 09:15.920
"Cool, natural, blokeish,

09:15.920 --> 09:19.200
"regional, warm, smooth, rich, gravelly..."

09:48.920 --> 09:50.880
'My name is Simon Binner.'

09:50.880 --> 09:54.160
I'm a very gregarious guy. An alpha male.

09:55.800 --> 09:59.880
'I have a loving family - Debbie, Hannah and her children,

09:59.880 --> 10:03.920
'and my brilliant daughter, Zoe, who lives in Germany.'

10:03.920 --> 10:06.840
I was extremely happy until my diagnosis.

10:09.160 --> 10:14.240
'I can feel my body changing week by week, and I'm now short of breath.

10:14.240 --> 10:18.920
'I'm going to give up driving a car imminently.

10:18.920 --> 10:21.080
'It's very sad for me.

10:22.520 --> 10:26.120
'I can't answer the phone or be a driving force at work.

10:26.120 --> 10:28.960
'In business, you need people to motivate

10:28.960 --> 10:31.040
'and paint sunlit visions of the future.

10:31.040 --> 10:32.760
'And I can't do that any more.

10:34.400 --> 10:37.440
'Originally, we were going to sell our business,

10:37.440 --> 10:40.120
'but I thought I would give my stepdaughter Hannah

10:40.120 --> 10:42.600
'the opportunity to see if she could do it.'

10:42.600 --> 10:43.880
How are you?

10:55.320 --> 10:57.120
- Add this to the gross.
- Yes.

10:57.120 --> 10:58.440
This month?

10:58.440 --> 11:00.320
- No.
- Next month.

11:01.600 --> 11:03.480
'He was operations director -

11:03.480 --> 11:07.400
'managing staff, organising meetings, everything.'

11:07.400 --> 11:09.640
So, we could save people a huge amount of money.

11:09.640 --> 11:12.600
So, who would it... Your company, who would it be...

11:12.600 --> 11:16.920
Sorry, your name again was...? Is it Brenda? Sorry, Deborah, sorry.

11:16.920 --> 11:21.160
Who is it in your company that we would need to speak to?

11:21.160 --> 11:23.840
'He was always the centre of attention,

11:23.840 --> 11:25.680
'the life and soul of the party.'

11:25.680 --> 11:29.360
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, good morning!

11:29.360 --> 11:31.240
My name's Rocco, Rocco Ancelotti,

11:31.240 --> 11:34.320
with the Global Pencil Company, here in New York City.

11:36.040 --> 11:40.720
When I first came in February, Simon was here most days.

11:40.720 --> 11:44.120
Now, Simon's probably here only one to two days a week,

11:44.120 --> 11:45.800
he gets quite tired.

12:47.800 --> 12:49.080
Oh...

13:04.400 --> 13:06.600
'I'm an independent type of guy

13:06.600 --> 13:10.080
'and the endgame of motor neurone disease is not to my taste.'

13:11.680 --> 13:13.640
Like a used car, I'm worn out,

13:13.640 --> 13:17.520
and it's no longer worth investing in the cost of repairs.

13:20.480 --> 13:23.080
'When we drove back from hospital after my diagnosis

13:23.080 --> 13:26.800
'in January, I decided then, en route in the car,

13:26.800 --> 13:28.960
'that I would have to either kill myself

13:28.960 --> 13:30.800
'or be euthanised in some way.'

13:32.560 --> 13:35.400
Motor neurone disease is a horrible disease to get.

13:35.400 --> 13:38.320
Typically, over six months to a year,

13:38.320 --> 13:40.800
their speaking is likely to get worse and worse

13:40.800 --> 13:43.600
until at some point, they won't be able to be understood by others.

13:43.600 --> 13:46.760
'Eventually, the arms will become completely paralysed,

13:46.760 --> 13:50.200
'the legs will become weaker and weaker, until eventually, someone

13:50.200 --> 13:54.760
'will need a stick to walk, then a walking frame, then a wheelchair.

13:54.760 --> 13:58.480
'But the thing that really carries people off is breathing difficulty.'

13:58.480 --> 14:00.720
It's fatal because, at some point,

14:00.720 --> 14:04.000
the muscles controlling the diaphragm will be affected.

14:04.000 --> 14:06.320
And when someone gets diaphragm weakness,

14:06.320 --> 14:07.840
they become short of breath,

14:07.840 --> 14:10.520
and we have things that can support people through that...

14:10.520 --> 14:14.000
through those symptoms, but, at some point, it becomes impossible.

14:15.160 --> 14:17.600
Whoa! Mummy!

14:20.240 --> 14:23.640
People might think, if they're able-bodied and able to walk around,

14:23.640 --> 14:26.280
they might think, "I would never want to be in a wheelchair."

14:26.280 --> 14:29.080
But it's not that the next day they'll be in a wheelchair,

14:29.080 --> 14:32.840
it's that, in a year's time they might be in a wheelchair.

14:32.840 --> 14:35.320
The process of getting to that point,

14:35.320 --> 14:38.040
they'll have adapted to other aspects of the illness,

14:38.040 --> 14:39.960
people actually cope far better

14:39.960 --> 14:42.720
than they might have thought at the beginning.

14:42.720 --> 14:45.120
Hardly anybody chooses assisted dying,

14:45.120 --> 14:47.440
less than 1% of our patients choose it.

14:47.440 --> 14:50.920
The vast majority choose palliative care

14:50.920 --> 14:53.080
and a peaceful death in that way.

15:15.720 --> 15:19.200
'I've always been quite anti assisted dying.'

15:19.200 --> 15:22.560
It's one of those dinner party conversations you have,

15:22.560 --> 15:24.480
never dreaming that you'd actually

15:24.480 --> 15:26.840
ever ACTUALLY be having this conversation.

15:29.520 --> 15:34.440
I think an assisted death, getting on a plane and going to Switzerland,

15:34.440 --> 15:37.720
actually, even the thought of it makes me feel physically sick,

15:37.720 --> 15:40.600
and I feel more and more,

15:40.600 --> 15:44.400
if I'm honest, utterly terrified of

15:44.400 --> 15:47.440
what it will be like, what the...

15:47.440 --> 15:53.080
And it's outside of most people's experience, so, um...

15:55.160 --> 15:58.280
Have you tried to persuade him not to?

16:00.360 --> 16:02.560
I don't know, I feel... I feel very...

16:04.040 --> 16:07.560
..frightened to upset him any more.

16:07.560 --> 16:12.040
Because he is very upset, though you wouldn't necessarily see it,

16:12.040 --> 16:14.640
but he is becoming quite vulnerable.

16:14.640 --> 16:17.600
As I think people do when they become ill,

16:17.600 --> 16:20.520
however strong you are, when you become physically ill,

16:20.520 --> 16:22.080
you become more vulnerable.

16:22.080 --> 16:25.360
So, I think I kind of avoid conversations

16:25.360 --> 16:27.520
a lot of the time and just say,

16:27.520 --> 16:30.040
"Oh, a cup of tea?" Doing those...

16:30.040 --> 16:33.280
Trying to make everyday life OK.

16:33.280 --> 16:36.560
But, um, so, we don't really talk about it

16:36.560 --> 16:39.080
and I almost can't talk about it, because it...

16:40.280 --> 16:41.960
..makes it more real.

16:46.560 --> 16:49.040
Shall we go to Grandad? Go to Grandad.

16:54.760 --> 16:57.800
'Should people have the right to die?

16:57.800 --> 17:00.400
'It's a question that's been asked for years.'

17:08.240 --> 17:10.440
'Helping someone to kill themselves is currently

17:10.440 --> 17:14.200
'punishable in England and Wales by up to 14 years in prison.'

17:14.200 --> 17:17.079
'There could be few issues of more fundamental importance

17:17.079 --> 17:20.359
'to society than how we treat the terminally ill.'

17:40.920 --> 17:42.040
'Thursday 19th.

17:45.840 --> 17:47.560
'E-mail to Dr Erika Preisig.

17:51.360 --> 17:52.480
'Hello, Dr Preisig.

17:55.480 --> 17:59.160

17:59.160 --> 18:02.440
'on the 7th January, 2015.

'And I'd like to have an eccentric, rock-and-roll version

18:05.440 --> 18:09.320
'of your highly esteemed assisted-dying service.'

18:13.400 --> 18:15.280
'There's always so much traffic.

18:18.480 --> 18:22.680
'This is one reason why we usually start at 8.30.'

18:22.680 --> 18:25.200
Do you always do them in the morning?

18:25.200 --> 18:26.320
Usually, yes.

18:26.320 --> 18:29.520
Usually, the authorities of Switzerland don't like us

18:29.520 --> 18:31.160
to do it in the afternoon.

18:33.000 --> 18:36.560
Because then, it runs into four or five o'clock

18:36.560 --> 18:38.840
and they want to go home.

18:43.080 --> 18:45.000
With assisted dying,

18:45.000 --> 18:49.360
there's three organisations who accept foreigners in Switzerland.

18:50.760 --> 18:53.440
Dignitas is the biggest one,

18:53.440 --> 18:57.080
lifecircle - it works in Basel.

18:59.240 --> 19:02.760
'We have two assisted dyings a week.

19:04.120 --> 19:06.720
'They have to send mails,

19:06.720 --> 19:09.760
'send doctor's reports about their illness.

19:11.160 --> 19:15.280
'I show the documents to another doctor, who is going to see them.

19:17.040 --> 19:19.600
'And if he says, "I think we can accept him,"

19:19.600 --> 19:22.280
'then he gets the provisional green light.'

19:43.920 --> 19:45.320
This is the medication.

19:51.600 --> 19:53.880
It's a powder that you have to dissolve.

19:57.400 --> 20:00.960
It's an anaesthetic, and if you take half a gram,

20:00.960 --> 20:04.280
you can have a big operation,

20:04.280 --> 20:06.880
which makes us feel safe

20:06.880 --> 20:09.240
that you feel no pain,

20:09.240 --> 20:11.800
you feel no fear, nothing.

20:13.160 --> 20:18.680
And this is 30 times the dose of a normal anaesthetic.

20:23.920 --> 20:27.320
'It takes 30 seconds until they fall asleep.

20:28.560 --> 20:30.640
'Within these 30 seconds,

'And within about four minutes, the heart stops beating

20:40.640 --> 20:42.440
'and they are dead.'

20:44.400 --> 20:47.840
OK, good.

'In just two months' time, the controversial

21:21.960 --> 21:25.240

'than assisting them in dying.'

Come on.

Onward!

22:20.720 --> 22:22.280

22:22.280 --> 22:23.520
Onward!

23:07.360 --> 23:08.400
Good boy.

23:09.440 --> 23:10.680
Good boy.

23:12.360 --> 23:14.000
Good boy.

23:18.280 --> 23:21.160
'In the future, when Ralph becomes poorly,

23:21.160 --> 23:25.560
'we'll call the vet to our house and we'll all stroke Ralph

'And then, he'll gently be put to sleep.'

23:32.800 --> 23:35.320
And that's what I'd like for me.

23:37.400 --> 23:41.000
'There's a time to live and a time to die.

23:42.760 --> 23:46.360
'Right now would be my ideal time to die.

23:50.360 --> 23:53.040
'Debbie's plight causes me incredible sadness,

23:53.040 --> 23:57.560
'because she's been so kind to me and so kind to Chloe.

23:59.000 --> 24:01.520
'We loved Chloe so much.

24:01.520 --> 24:04.120
'She was the centre of our lives.'

24:07.320 --> 24:09.680
Chloe was my youngest daughter.

24:15.200 --> 24:18.960
She got a rare bone cancer at 15.

24:21.080 --> 24:23.120
She had treatment for three years

24:23.120 --> 24:25.320
and then she died when she was 18,

24:25.320 --> 24:27.240
which was two years ago.

24:28.600 --> 24:32.280
But the pain became unbearable for her at one point

24:32.280 --> 24:35.080
and she asked me to kill her.

24:35.080 --> 24:37.760
And I think...

24:39.040 --> 24:42.040
..to have, you know, your 18-year-old daughter

24:42.040 --> 24:43.600
asking you to do that...

24:43.600 --> 24:46.560
But we had a fantastic palliative care team, absolutely fantastic

24:46.560 --> 24:50.120
palliative care team, and they came round and sorted it out.

24:50.120 --> 24:54.440
Then the next day, she woke up, as kids do at that age, and said,

24:54.440 --> 24:57.080
"Oh, I'm sorry I asked you to do that, Mum."

24:57.080 --> 25:00.120
It was like... "Oh, my God!"

25:00.120 --> 25:04.080
And then, we went on and had a few months of some lovely times.

25:11.920 --> 25:14.520
Losing a child, there's nothing worse than that,

25:14.520 --> 25:16.120
but there was something...

25:17.440 --> 25:20.480
..more natural? I don't know.

25:20.480 --> 25:24.480
In that we knew that we had...

25:24.480 --> 25:26.600
This is so hard,

25:26.600 --> 25:30.200
because motor neurone disease is such a different illness, but...

25:30.200 --> 25:35.200
There was still hope with my daughter, right up to the end,

25:35.200 --> 25:40.080
we were still hoping for another day, and we had lovely times,

25:40.080 --> 25:42.600
and I guess, maybe, if I thought about it,

25:42.600 --> 25:46.080
there's a bit of anger in me that, you know,

25:46.080 --> 25:48.680
why can't Simon just do that?

25:48.680 --> 25:52.440
You know, your life closes in when you get ill, I think,

25:52.440 --> 25:56.160
but we still really enjoyed watching telly together,

25:56.160 --> 26:01.120
or eating together, and it's those little things that become so...

26:01.120 --> 26:04.040
So, maybe, there's a bit of me that thinks, "Oh, why can't you,

26:04.040 --> 26:06.560
"you know, do that?" But...

26:26.400 --> 26:27.960
'Wednesday 24th.

26:29.240 --> 26:30.920
'Hello, Erika.

26:30.920 --> 26:34.440
'I've just used Google Maps and you're only 90 minutes' drive

26:34.440 --> 26:36.760
'from Freiburg, Germany, where Debbie and I

26:36.760 --> 26:40.880
'will be on holiday with two friends, Will and Chris Watson.

26:40.880 --> 26:44.400
'Will Watson is also my business partner.

'We were both born in November 1957.

'I've known him since we were

26:49.720 --> 26:52.680
'eight-year-old boys at Bolton School.

26:52.680 --> 26:56.520
'I could get Will to drive me over to meet you, if that was convenient.

26:58.120 --> 27:02.240
'I would like to book myself into your clinic on Monday, 2nd November.

27:02.240 --> 27:04.720
'Ebullient regards, Simon Binner.'

27:06.200 --> 27:08.480
If you say you want to go on the 2nd of November,

27:08.480 --> 27:10.760
what if you, a week before, say,

27:10.760 --> 27:13.200
"Well, I want to hang on a bit longer?"

27:19.640 --> 27:21.600
- You don't know that.
- You don't know.

27:21.600 --> 27:24.200
- No, I won't.
- Well, I'll ask her that.

27:24.200 --> 27:26.920
What's so significant about the 2nd of November?

27:26.920 --> 27:28.520
It's his birthday.

27:29.720 --> 27:32.800
'We met at primary school.'

27:34.000 --> 27:38.640
He was always the guy telling jokes, the, the...

27:38.640 --> 27:41.760
the big man in the crowd, the leader of the gang.

27:52.560 --> 27:56.080
- Oh, OK.
- So, you'll be quirky in that...

27:56.080 --> 28:00.040
'One worry I have with Simon,

28:00.040 --> 28:04.320
'he has a tendency for the big gesture.

28:04.320 --> 28:06.600
'That this may be'

28:06.600 --> 28:10.160
the big gesture to end them all, if you see what I mean.

28:10.160 --> 28:14.920
And that once he's made the decision and publicised his intention,

28:14.920 --> 28:19.240
he will then feel locked into it, even though

28:19.240 --> 28:22.680
he might be having second thoughts later.

28:22.680 --> 28:25.600
- So, you haven't actually met her before?
- No.

28:25.600 --> 28:29.240
- Have you thought of the questions you want to ask her?
- No.

28:29.240 --> 28:31.760
Well, THAT is a worry.

28:31.760 --> 28:34.720
It worries me that you're not thinking these things through.

28:34.720 --> 28:38.040
No, I have thought these things through!

28:41.040 --> 28:43.080
How do you know you're going downhill?

28:50.320 --> 28:52.120
But that doesn't stop you living.

28:52.120 --> 28:55.560
You can eat, your arms and legs work, you can see,

28:55.560 --> 28:57.120
you can hear, you can...

28:59.840 --> 29:02.120
Everyone feels vulnerable at some point, so...

29:02.120 --> 29:04.920
And you're not thinking about these things, you're just saying,

29:04.920 --> 29:07.000
"I'm booking on the 2nd November."

29:07.000 --> 29:08.800
Because I think that's panic.

29:08.800 --> 29:10.840
I am going down like this.

29:10.840 --> 29:14.200
Yes, but... No, you are saying you are going down like this...

29:14.200 --> 29:16.840
- I am, I am!
- You're not.

29:23.200 --> 29:28.080
We have far too many demands for assisted dying.

29:28.080 --> 29:31.640
More demands than you have dates to give to the people.

29:33.280 --> 29:34.960
Ja.

29:34.960 --> 29:38.000
Klar, klar, klar. Ja.

29:39.560 --> 29:42.720
'How can you decide to which ones you say no,

29:42.720 --> 29:45.440
'to which ones you say yes?'

29:45.440 --> 29:47.560
Come in. Come in.

29:49.040 --> 29:51.560
'In Switzerland, the guidelines are,

29:51.560 --> 29:56.880
'you must have some sort of illness, you must be of sound mind,

29:56.880 --> 30:01.080
'you must have been thinking about it for a long time.

30:02.280 --> 30:04.720
'I have to listen and make sure'

30:04.720 --> 30:07.720
they are not throwing something away, the most precious

30:07.720 --> 30:12.640
gift of life, that has ever been given to them, too early.

30:30.320 --> 30:32.080
- Yes.
- Never.

30:43.320 --> 30:45.400
You have thought it through.

30:48.280 --> 30:49.640
- You want to die.
- Yeah.

30:49.640 --> 30:52.040
Yes.

31:04.320 --> 31:08.160
You have an incurable illness, you are of sound mind,

31:08.160 --> 31:12.080
you don't seem to be depressed, even though you have a very bad illness,

31:12.080 --> 31:13.800
which is very good...

31:13.800 --> 31:16.440
- Can I ask you a question about it?
- Yes, of course.

31:16.440 --> 31:20.400
Because how do you know he's of sound mind at the moment?

31:20.400 --> 31:22.320
Just by talking to him.

31:22.320 --> 31:24.200
- Right.
- Just by listening to him.

31:24.200 --> 31:27.120
Could it be that he's just really scared today

31:27.120 --> 31:30.920
and that maybe as time...

31:30.920 --> 31:34.920
Like tomorrow, the next day, he might feel a bit different.

31:34.920 --> 31:38.640
Cos his... Cos I live with him and see his mood go up and down.

31:38.640 --> 31:41.240
Yes, yes.

31:41.240 --> 31:45.120
I think what makes me worry is that he's so frightened...

31:50.240 --> 31:52.920
But you're frightened of being incapacitated.

31:57.880 --> 31:59.240
Yeah, OK.

32:05.000 --> 32:07.600
It worries me that it's a knee-jerk reaction.

32:07.600 --> 32:11.040
"Right, that's it. I'm going and..."

32:12.120 --> 32:16.200
And I want him to think about it more deeply and...

32:16.200 --> 32:18.720
It depends on what you want.

32:18.720 --> 32:21.440
But it's your decision.

32:21.440 --> 32:24.480
Why are you so sure, Erika?

32:24.480 --> 32:27.840
Why do you feel so passionately about it?

32:27.840 --> 32:30.280
You only have to listen to people.

32:30.280 --> 32:32.720
You really have to listen to them.

32:32.720 --> 32:34.920
You know, he's not a child.

32:34.920 --> 32:37.240
He knows what he wants to do.

32:37.240 --> 32:39.120
And it is his life.

32:39.120 --> 32:42.480
He has been taking responsibility for his life

32:42.480 --> 32:43.960
for many, many years,

32:43.960 --> 32:46.720
and he's a strong-minded person.

32:46.720 --> 32:49.080
And now, at the end of life,

32:49.080 --> 32:50.960
that he gets weaker...

32:52.280 --> 32:54.760
..he is still strong-minded,

32:54.760 --> 32:57.600
but people tend to treat

32:57.600 --> 33:00.640
as if they were children.

33:02.880 --> 33:05.080
I can understand what you want.

33:05.080 --> 33:08.640
You would like to keep your husband as long as possible

33:08.640 --> 33:10.840
- because you love him.
- Mm.

33:11.960 --> 33:16.160
- And it's very, very difficult to accept.
- Mm.

33:18.080 --> 33:21.160
Saying goodbye before nature...

33:23.440 --> 33:25.520
..forces you to.

33:26.720 --> 33:28.440
- Mm.
- Um...

33:28.440 --> 33:32.560
People who have to let go do the more difficult job

33:32.560 --> 33:35.080
- than the people who go.
- Mm.

33:35.080 --> 33:37.160
That's very important to know.

33:37.160 --> 33:40.960
It is much easier to go into an assisted dying

33:40.960 --> 33:44.320
than to accept an assisted dying. Do you know why?

33:46.600 --> 33:49.360
After you're dead, you're dead.

33:49.360 --> 33:52.240
- Yeah.
- You're out of the problems.
- Yeah.

33:52.240 --> 33:54.960
But your wife has to go on living.

34:00.240 --> 34:05.320
You must ask yourself - is it his decision? Is it your decision?

34:05.320 --> 34:07.960
- Is it his life? Is it your life?
- Mm.

34:09.960 --> 34:11.600
I know it's difficult.

34:14.440 --> 34:19.600
Dying does not have to be something horrible. Dying can be something...

34:19.600 --> 34:21.480
Something like a ceremony.

34:21.480 --> 34:24.719
Do you know, last week, we had an assisted dying

34:24.719 --> 34:29.159
and this lady had 21 people who were with her.

34:29.159 --> 34:31.120
- Really?
- 21 people.

34:31.120 --> 34:34.679
That was the most... the highest number that we ever had.

34:34.679 --> 34:37.040
And it was so nice...

34:41.440 --> 34:43.080
You must do it your way.

34:51.679 --> 34:54.840
- You would like to die on your birthday?
- Yeah.

34:58.240 --> 35:03.000
I'm a little bit afraid that you hang on to your birthday

35:03.000 --> 35:08.760
so strongly that you are not willing to postpone it.

35:08.760 --> 35:13.840
If you were as well as you are now on the end of October,

35:13.840 --> 35:15.840
would you postpone it?

35:15.840 --> 35:18.840
- If you were exactly like you are now?
- Yes.

35:18.840 --> 35:21.360
- Then you would postpone it?
- Yes.

35:21.360 --> 35:25.000
For me, it is important to know this.

35:25.000 --> 35:27.080
I do not want you to go too early.

35:36.600 --> 35:38.480
The 2nd November?

35:38.480 --> 35:42.360
You are welcome to have an assisted dying, for sure.

36:51.840 --> 36:55.200
It is a big step to take, isn't it?

36:55.200 --> 36:57.120
And he is doing it on his birthday.

36:58.560 --> 37:01.400
- Are you going to go, too?
- Yes. I am.

37:02.440 --> 37:04.320
I was there when he was born.

37:07.680 --> 37:11.920
I don't encourage him, but I will go along with whatever he wants.

37:11.920 --> 37:15.720
He will stay as long as he's enjoying himself, won't he?

37:15.720 --> 37:17.040
I think.

37:17.040 --> 37:21.440
I don't know if anybody ever does go to Switzerland and come home,

37:21.440 --> 37:25.000
change their mind. I don't know if they've ever done. Do you?

37:32.080 --> 37:33.680
'Text message to College Boys.

37:36.400 --> 37:40.120
'I am booked to die now on Monday, 2nd November.

'Thank you for bringing the annual Christ College reunion

39 years now.

38:08.800 --> 38:10.440
In a way, we're like brothers.

38:13.120 --> 38:16.680
He was the funny one, he always made us laugh.

38:24.840 --> 38:26.560
We have always laughed a lot.

38:26.560 --> 38:29.160
Binner told the best jokes that I'd ever heard.

38:29.160 --> 38:31.640
We used to do ludicrous things.

38:31.640 --> 38:34.640
Binner and I used to try and not go to bed for 72 hours.

38:34.640 --> 38:37.000
So, we would stay up for days and nights

38:37.000 --> 38:39.120
cos we'd try and hallucinate.

38:39.120 --> 38:41.280
Nothing was predictable.

38:41.280 --> 38:44.120
There was some holiday where he managed to tell people

38:44.120 --> 38:46.480
all the way through, for some bizarre reason,

38:46.480 --> 38:48.120
that he was a funeral director,

38:48.120 --> 38:51.360
and maintained this fiction for two weeks or something.

38:51.360 --> 38:54.840
- Salut!
- Salute!
- Get it right, man!

38:54.840 --> 38:57.760
Salut! Is it salut or salute?

38:57.760 --> 39:01.160
We are actually all feeling distraught, you know?

39:01.160 --> 39:05.720
We have sustained a very close set of friendships all this time

39:05.720 --> 39:08.960
and he is utterly central to our group.

39:08.960 --> 39:10.520
And, uh,

39:10.520 --> 39:13.320
I know I am probably more sentimental than many other people,

39:13.320 --> 39:16.360
and I have cried every time I've seen him for the last few months!

39:16.360 --> 39:18.800
So, I saw him last Saturday, I cried pathetically.

39:18.800 --> 39:20.280
Some of these people here,

39:20.280 --> 39:22.480
this will be the last time they see him.

39:22.480 --> 39:24.560
Really good to see you.

39:26.600 --> 39:30.160
I was sort of shocked and surprised

39:30.160 --> 39:34.920
to know that Simon had set a date for his, uh...

39:36.160 --> 39:39.240
What's the appropriate term? Assisted suicide?

39:39.240 --> 39:44.320
He seems to be checking out ahead of his time.

39:44.320 --> 39:49.520
And I am not entirely comfortable with his decision.

39:53.320 --> 39:55.000
We're all crushed.

39:56.400 --> 39:59.320
How can one be reconciled to someone who is so great

39:59.320 --> 40:03.000
taking themselves off at the age of 58 and killing themselves?

40:05.560 --> 40:09.440
I think he's chosen a date which is too soon.

40:15.040 --> 40:17.880
"Bins, I know you feel strongly about it

40:17.880 --> 40:19.400
"but I do feel that setting

40:19.400 --> 40:24.360
"a date in advance is potentially deeply problematic. Debs has real

40:24.360 --> 40:28.400
"qualms about you choosing the date in advance and that worries me, too.

40:29.800 --> 40:31.680
"Debbie has rights in this."

40:41.800 --> 40:45.560
Taking yourself off to Switzerland could be seen as selfish.

40:48.280 --> 40:50.280
Binner is very forceful,

40:50.280 --> 40:53.960
but he is arguable-with. If Debbie was more resolute in saying,

40:53.960 --> 40:57.800
"Binnie, no, you can't do this, I forbid you from doing it."

40:57.800 --> 41:01.400
That would make it a much more difficult matter for all of us.

42:22.000 --> 42:24.160
'He is changing as a person.

42:25.640 --> 42:27.640
'I sense his, kind of, creeping isolation.'

42:28.960 --> 42:31.040
I am doing more and more,

42:31.040 --> 42:34.320
which he gets increasingly cross about, but...

42:40.640 --> 42:44.320
'I hate the fact that he thinks because he has an illness,

42:44.320 --> 42:47.120
'he is somehow less worthy of being able to live,

42:47.120 --> 42:49.600
'enjoy things and have the right to stay alive.

42:51.400 --> 42:54.320
'I feel very, very strongly that he is not a burden.'

42:59.200 --> 43:02.280
It's those little practical things that can help.

43:02.280 --> 43:05.760
Ralph needs to be walked twice a day.

43:05.760 --> 43:08.440
Um, he can't walk Ralph now.

43:13.200 --> 43:16.040
- What?
- Mountain biking.

43:17.720 --> 43:19.200
Mountain biking.

43:19.200 --> 43:22.200
- "Moneymaking"?
- No! Mountain!

43:23.280 --> 43:25.000
Biking...

43:25.000 --> 43:26.800
Oh, yes, mountain biking.

43:26.800 --> 43:31.080
So, I mean, three months ago, less than three months ago,

43:31.080 --> 43:35.000
Bins and I were cycling in the Italian Alps, cycling up mountains.

43:36.560 --> 43:39.360
The speed of change, it's accelerated.

43:45.640 --> 43:48.720
We are all in fast-forward at the moment, and you want to try

43:48.720 --> 43:52.920
and stall it, you want to try and capture every moment. And you can't.

43:54.240 --> 43:57.680
How are you feeling about the November date?

43:57.680 --> 44:00.360
Uh, I am dreading it.

44:00.360 --> 44:03.400
And I am disbelieving it, in a way,

44:03.400 --> 44:05.800
I don't want to believe it,

44:05.800 --> 44:07.680
because that's...

44:07.680 --> 44:10.720
I'm probably not the only one, that's my way of coping.

44:10.720 --> 44:12.600
As I was coming over here today,

44:12.600 --> 44:15.560
I was figuring out how many days left, you know,

44:15.560 --> 44:16.880
how many weeks left.

44:16.880 --> 44:19.880
And it's... And it's...

44:19.880 --> 44:21.400
It's going so quickly.

44:22.880 --> 44:27.400
- Well, it's...
- Uh...
- It's eight weeks, just under eight weeks now.

44:41.640 --> 44:45.160
Are you OK this morning? Yes?

45:31.600 --> 45:33.840
All right?

45:33.840 --> 45:35.560
Yeah?

45:37.160 --> 45:38.960
Yes.

45:43.720 --> 45:45.240
Three.

45:56.400 --> 45:58.800
- Thank you.
- Yes?

45:58.800 --> 46:01.280
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

46:11.120 --> 46:14.600
'MPs will today be debating whether to legalise assisted dying.

46:14.600 --> 46:17.120
'The Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby,

46:17.120 --> 46:20.040
'has described it as one of the biggest dilemmas of our time.'

46:21.880 --> 46:23.480
'Order!

46:23.480 --> 46:26.200
'It's a great honour to speak on a debate

46:26.200 --> 46:28.600
'which is actually a matter of life or death.'

46:37.400 --> 46:40.840
'I think it's naive to believe that we can prevent

46:40.840 --> 46:44.440
'the persuasion of an elderly, expensive or asset-rich relative

46:44.440 --> 46:46.440
'being encouraged, coerced or emotionally

46:46.440 --> 46:49.600
- 'blackmailed into taking their own life.
- Hear, hear!

46:49.600 --> 46:53.440
'I've cared for my husband for five years,

46:53.440 --> 46:58.440
'and I saw when life changed to being a burden.

46:58.440 --> 47:02.080
'Who wants to travel to Switzerland? Why should we have to?

47:02.080 --> 47:05.480
'Why can't we die at home, which is where most people want to?

47:05.480 --> 47:09.720
'We are here to protect the most vulnerable in our society,

47:09.720 --> 47:12.880
'not to legislate to kill them.

47:12.880 --> 47:14.480
'It says something for any society,

47:14.480 --> 47:17.560
'the way in which they look after their most vulnerable

47:17.560 --> 47:20.160
'and their elderly, and I fundamentally worry

47:20.160 --> 47:23.400
'that we are starting down a path that essentially says

47:23.400 --> 47:25.200
'that those lives are worth less.

47:30.800 --> 47:34.560
I am a GP from Margate and I'm very concerned that this bill,

47:34.560 --> 47:36.560
I think, is detrimental to this country.

47:36.560 --> 47:40.160
Essentially, if this goes through, metaphorically, on Monday morning,

47:40.160 --> 47:42.880
I could cure people with my left hand and kill them with my right.

47:42.880 --> 47:47.760
It is God who determines when a person should die.

47:47.760 --> 47:50.600
It is God's will, isn't it? Good old God!

47:50.600 --> 47:52.960
Oh, yes, oh, yes! It's the meaning of life.

47:52.960 --> 47:55.760
Well, that's good for you, cos I don't believe in God,

47:55.760 --> 47:59.000
cos your so-called God took my wife away.

47:59.000 --> 48:01.720
'The House of Commons has voted decisively

48:01.720 --> 48:04.280
'against proposals to give terminally ill patients

48:04.280 --> 48:07.320
'the right to end their lives under medical supervision.'

48:19.880 --> 48:22.920
'This is such a crushing defeat, it settles this matter

48:22.920 --> 48:26.240
'in terms of legislation for the foreseeable future.

48:26.240 --> 48:30.320
'It leaves us with the status quo of one Briton per fortnight

48:30.320 --> 48:34.240
'travelling to Switzerland to die with the help of the suicide...'

49:08.240 --> 49:11.800
I've become suddenly very, kind of strong-willed about it.

49:11.800 --> 49:14.360
I think I was just going along with Simon,

49:14.360 --> 49:16.960
and I suddenly felt this isn't the right decision.

49:16.960 --> 49:20.720
This isn't right for him, and he's giving mixed messages.

49:21.920 --> 49:24.000
We need to explore another way.

49:29.200 --> 49:32.000
And when the Assisted Dying Bill got voted down yesterday

49:32.000 --> 49:33.720
I was pleased,

49:33.720 --> 49:36.160
and I thought it was the, kind of...

49:36.160 --> 49:39.320
I am only just saying what I think.

49:41.320 --> 49:46.040
It's a kind of vote for the sanctity of a human life, to me,

49:46.040 --> 49:50.400
without sounding too twee and dramatic about it. But, this...

49:51.720 --> 49:53.440
I want to look really, really carefully

49:53.440 --> 49:55.240
at what's on offer with hospice care.

49:55.240 --> 49:57.360
Simon can tell me to bugger off,

49:57.360 --> 49:59.840
it's his life, but that's how I feel.

50:06.880 --> 50:11.480
Simon was referred by his consultant at King's.

50:11.480 --> 50:14.360
His first appointment was very much focusing on

50:14.360 --> 50:16.800
what we could offer here at St Christopher's,

50:16.800 --> 50:19.560
what sort of medical intervention we could offer.

50:22.360 --> 50:25.440
If someone's breathless, for example when someone develops

50:25.440 --> 50:28.240
breathing difficulty because of diaphragm weakness,

50:28.240 --> 50:31.840
the first thing we can do is offer them non-invasive ventilation,

50:31.840 --> 50:33.840
which is a mask that goes over the face.

50:33.840 --> 50:37.160
When they breathe in, it detects that and helps by blowing air in.

50:38.440 --> 50:40.920
But at some point, it won't be effective.

50:42.720 --> 50:47.000
To take away the feeling of panic or breathlessness, we give morphine.

50:47.000 --> 50:50.000
If that happens to shorten life, then so be it.

50:50.000 --> 50:53.040
The law and the ethics around this are very clear.

50:53.040 --> 50:55.960
We're not allowed to give drugs to end someone's life,

50:55.960 --> 50:58.440
but if the aim of giving a drug is to relieve distress,

50:58.440 --> 51:00.040
and that might shorten life,

51:00.040 --> 51:02.240
we are ethically obliged to give that treatment.

51:07.880 --> 51:09.720
We then talked about the fact

51:09.720 --> 51:13.400
that he'd taken total control over going to Switzerland.

51:15.120 --> 51:18.760
But knowing that Debbie and his family didn't want him to go

51:18.760 --> 51:21.040
was really sort of conflicting him.

51:25.400 --> 51:28.120
He really sort of talked about Debbie...

51:28.120 --> 51:30.560
wanting to do it sort of right by her.

51:32.440 --> 51:36.560
With Debbie losing Chloe two years previously,

51:36.560 --> 51:39.880
the impact on her was going to be absolutely enormous.

51:39.880 --> 51:41.680
He was very mindful of that,

51:41.680 --> 51:45.360
so that really played into his decision-making.

52:00.600 --> 52:02.480
We'd been told very clearly

52:02.480 --> 52:06.560
that actually the death from motor neurone disease is not a bad death.

52:08.280 --> 52:09.920
It's often with pneumonia.

52:09.920 --> 52:14.680
And, actually, we're living with disability now and we're managing.

52:17.960 --> 52:22.200
And we have nice times and difficult times and sometimes you wake up

52:22.200 --> 52:25.440
and think, "God, this is dreadful, how has this happened?"

52:25.440 --> 52:27.440
And other times, we're sitting laughing,

52:27.440 --> 52:29.440
surrounded by family and friends.

52:29.440 --> 52:34.560
And there's still lots of bits that are really lovely about life.

52:34.560 --> 52:40.440
And I cannot take him to Basel

52:40.440 --> 52:42.880
because I don't think it's...

52:42.880 --> 52:45.640
One, I don't think it's the right thing to do, and two,

52:45.640 --> 52:50.160
and perhaps most importantly, I don't believe he really wants to go.

52:52.000 --> 52:54.000
You are reconsidering?

52:57.920 --> 52:59.640
He is, apparently.

52:59.640 --> 53:00.680
I am.

53:03.640 --> 53:06.680
'In him reconsidering, we suddenly have hope again.'

53:08.320 --> 53:09.800
That's a real change.

53:17.760 --> 53:21.440
'I thought they'd be indifferent to the timing of my demise.

53:21.440 --> 53:22.840
'I was so wrong.

53:24.960 --> 53:28.360
'If I was single, I'd be gone. Definitely.'

53:32.920 --> 53:34.560
But I'm not single.

53:34.560 --> 53:37.040
And I have responsibilities to others

53:37.040 --> 53:39.760
that I'm only now starting to fully understand.

53:50.200 --> 53:52.200
'Tuesday, 22nd September.

He's still taking part in things.

54:54.840 --> 54:56.840
He's very competitive.

Yes.

55:04.840 --> 55:06.920
Yes!

55:06.920 --> 55:09.480
He can still write.

55:09.480 --> 55:13.000
When his writing slows down, we don't know what will happen.

55:13.000 --> 55:15.400
But at the moment, he's doing very well, actually,

55:15.400 --> 55:18.760
and getting so much support from everybody.

55:18.760 --> 55:23.000
He's always been very sociable, and, in the years, it's paid off.

55:23.000 --> 55:27.200
He's got all his daft friends that have grown up very supportive.

55:27.200 --> 55:29.880
- It's the most uncomfortable bloody seat.
- Are you on?

55:29.880 --> 55:33.080
- I suppose so, yes.
- Right, do you want left hand or right hand?

55:33.080 --> 55:37.000
I think left hand, cos I'm going to hold on tight with my right hand.

55:37.000 --> 55:41.160

'He laughs so much.'

56:13.840 --> 56:15.840
He writes his texts or his notes,

56:15.840 --> 56:18.960
and he's shaking with laughter at his own jokes.

56:25.280 --> 56:28.920
Whenever I see him, when I come home, I get in the car

56:28.920 --> 56:33.120
and I just think, "What a lovely day! What a happy house!"

56:45.960 --> 56:49.160
Right, are you saying anything for me, you guys?

"Oh, no, now, I'm hating everything, but I'm sort of trapped."

58:39.920 --> 58:42.760
'I'll be totally unable to communicate soon.

58:44.920 --> 58:48.680
'It's terrifying to think my only form of interaction will be gone.

58:51.800 --> 58:54.720
'Losing my voice is bad, but none...

58:56.000 --> 58:57.960
'None is terrible.'

59:09.240 --> 59:11.000
"Debbie Binner wrote.

59:11.000 --> 59:13.320
"Simon Binner - Urgent.

59:13.320 --> 59:18.280
"Dear Erika, Simon is sitting next to me after a terrifying morning.

59:18.280 --> 59:20.720
"He has tried to hang himself.

59:20.720 --> 59:22.920
"We have calmed him down.

59:22.920 --> 59:26.240
"But now, he is saying he needs to die now

59:26.240 --> 59:28.760
"and wants to come as soon as possible.

59:28.760 --> 59:32.600
"This Friday, 16th October, at the least.

59:32.600 --> 59:35.880
"Please, can you advise if it is possible.

59:35.880 --> 59:37.800
"He says he's desperate.

59:37.800 --> 59:40.400
"Debbie Binner. Kind regards."

59:43.200 --> 59:48.320
Yes, and I have told her that 16th October is not possible.

59:48.320 --> 59:56.600
And he promised me, by writing and by Debbie telling me,

59:56.600 --> 01:00:00.280
that he would accept to come on Monday 19th

01:00:00.280 --> 01:00:04.080
and he promised that he would not do something like that any more.

01:00:10.440 --> 01:00:12.120
Until this happened to Binner,

01:00:12.120 --> 01:00:15.800
I never really thought that you could be so frightened of not dying.

01:00:15.800 --> 01:00:20.120
And for Binns to have done what he did yesterday...

01:00:20.120 --> 01:00:22.120
sort of demonstrates -

01:00:22.120 --> 01:00:25.280
given he's not an unthinking or cruel person -

01:00:25.280 --> 01:00:30.200
sort of demonstrates the absolute horror that he feels,

01:00:30.200 --> 01:00:33.320
that, I think, you know, he was so overwhelmed

01:00:33.320 --> 01:00:35.800
that he kind of lost the plot, in a way,

01:00:35.800 --> 01:00:38.480
and did something which I think is...

01:00:39.720 --> 01:00:42.280
You know, he was properly sorry about.

01:00:46.560 --> 01:00:53.240
I think somehow we've missed those moments of unendurable tragedy.

01:00:53.240 --> 01:00:57.120
And...you know, you can just forget that

01:00:57.120 --> 01:00:59.600
because you just see him

01:00:59.600 --> 01:01:01.760
as funny and upbeat and...

01:01:01.760 --> 01:01:03.160
you know, hilarious.

01:01:05.840 --> 01:01:10.000
There's going to be a small farewell lunch party,

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.480
which Debbie's sent a card...

01:01:12.480 --> 01:01:14.520
A sort of...

01:01:14.520 --> 01:01:18.160
Given where they are, quite a jolly note about...on...

01:01:18.160 --> 01:01:19.760
on Friday.

01:01:25.960 --> 01:01:29.120
"Dearest friends, our precious time is moving fast.

01:01:29.120 --> 01:01:30.680
"As I'm sure you all know,

01:01:30.680 --> 01:01:33.480
"my precious Simon is going to Switzerland to end his life

01:01:33.480 --> 01:01:35.000
"on Monday, 19th October.

01:01:36.080 --> 01:01:37.760
"We've had one hell of a week.

01:01:37.760 --> 01:01:39.600
"And in light of recent developments,

01:01:39.600 --> 01:01:42.120
"Switzerland seems the kindest and best option.

01:01:42.120 --> 01:01:44.560
"Simon has made it very clear that he's had enough."

01:01:51.200 --> 01:01:53.560
"Please know that you will find us beaten,

01:01:53.560 --> 01:01:55.920
"battle-weary and bruised on Friday.

01:01:55.920 --> 01:01:58.680
"But we love you all and want to celebrate one last time

01:01:58.680 --> 01:02:02.160
"in a gentle, more low-key way than before.

01:02:02.160 --> 01:02:04.560
"Love, hugs and strengths, Debbie."

01:02:26.360 --> 01:02:28.120
Are you scared?

01:02:28.120 --> 01:02:29.520
No.

01:02:30.840 --> 01:02:32.680
No.

01:03:03.240 --> 01:03:05.280
He's not in a good state now,

01:03:05.280 --> 01:03:09.160
and I know, before, I fought and battled so hard,

01:03:09.160 --> 01:03:14.560
but he's made it very clear that he does not want to carry on his life.

01:03:17.440 --> 01:03:19.280
I feel furious, um...

01:03:22.480 --> 01:03:24.880
Tender. Loving.

01:03:24.880 --> 01:03:27.680
Um...protective.

01:03:27.680 --> 01:03:29.600
Um...

01:03:29.600 --> 01:03:32.560
So pleased I married him.

01:03:32.560 --> 01:03:35.800
And I'll miss him terribly.

01:03:41.200 --> 01:03:43.960
It's terribly sad, terribly sad.

01:03:43.960 --> 01:03:47.360
And, um... And we love each other.

01:03:47.360 --> 01:03:48.640
It's, um...

01:03:48.640 --> 01:03:51.360
But I think, at the end of the day,

01:03:51.360 --> 01:03:53.120
if you love someone,

01:03:53.120 --> 01:03:56.480
you have to do what they want to do.

01:03:58.080 --> 01:03:59.240
And...

01:03:59.240 --> 01:04:04.000
And I think we've got to the point where, when Simon does die,

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:05.320
it's not...

01:04:05.320 --> 01:04:09.760
It won't...take away what we've had,

01:04:09.760 --> 01:04:12.400
it will be there still

01:04:12.400 --> 01:04:15.880
and I think I'm so glad I met him.

01:04:48.920 --> 01:04:51.760
I said goodbye to him at the party.

01:04:51.760 --> 01:04:55.040
He was lying down, tired, in the room

01:04:55.040 --> 01:04:59.120
and when he came to say goodbye to me, we had a good cry.

01:04:59.120 --> 01:05:02.560
And Elizabeth said, "Well, he didn't want to cry

01:05:02.560 --> 01:05:05.000
"when he was saying goodbye to us."

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:09.760
He wanted to keep his act going all the time, didn't he?

01:05:10.920 --> 01:05:12.520
So, we both cried.

01:05:14.440 --> 01:05:16.800
Elizabeth said you could understand

01:05:16.800 --> 01:05:19.320
why he didn't invite me to Switzerland.

01:05:19.320 --> 01:05:21.400
I haven't been on a plane for a long time

01:05:21.400 --> 01:05:23.360
and my balance isn't all that good.

01:05:23.360 --> 01:05:26.120
But I was quite looking forward to going.

01:05:26.120 --> 01:05:30.000
I thought, "It was MY son, I had him, and..."

01:05:32.360 --> 01:05:37.120
I keep thinking, "Well, I can't get another son, can I?"

01:05:58.800 --> 01:06:04.120
'Hello, Five Musketeers. You can now print off your boarding passes.

01:06:05.440 --> 01:06:11.640
'Passengers - Debbie, Mike, Elizabeth, Dr Sandberg and Will.'

01:06:13.240 --> 01:06:15.320
'Thank you for waiting, at this time,

01:06:15.320 --> 01:06:17.640
'will all remaining customers please board now...'

01:06:21.120 --> 01:06:24.000
Suicide in this country is not in offence.

01:06:26.480 --> 01:06:29.960
The law is very clear about what is the offence,

01:06:29.960 --> 01:06:33.320
and the offence is assisting or encouraging

01:06:33.320 --> 01:06:35.560
somebody to commit suicide.

01:06:35.560 --> 01:06:38.120
If you take somebody to Dignitas, for example,

01:06:38.120 --> 01:06:40.880
you arrange the flights, you put them on the plane,

01:06:40.880 --> 01:06:43.600
you take them there, that's the sort of assistance

01:06:43.600 --> 01:06:45.720
that could be an offence under the act.

01:06:47.840 --> 01:06:49.960
Maximum penalty is up to 14 years.

01:06:51.200 --> 01:06:55.080
But it's a matter of each individual case and circumstance.

01:06:57.680 --> 01:07:01.800
We'll take into account the clear and express intention, if there is,

01:07:01.800 --> 01:07:06.960
of the individual, the compassionate nature of the people who assisted.

01:07:06.960 --> 01:07:09.120
We will weigh up and decide

01:07:09.120 --> 01:07:12.480
whether or not that means we should prosecute or not.

01:08:01.040 --> 01:08:02.840
There's a handle just here.

01:08:27.279 --> 01:08:30.439
The person only knows the last evening

01:08:30.439 --> 01:08:32.279
if it is definitely accepted.

01:08:34.720 --> 01:08:37.600
- Hello, Mrs Binner?
- Hello, very nice to meet you.

01:08:37.600 --> 01:08:40.240
- Nice to meet you.
- Come in.

01:08:40.240 --> 01:08:44.040
'Simon must convince the second doctor, also.'

01:08:45.359 --> 01:08:48.160
Hello. Hello, Mr Binner.

01:08:48.160 --> 01:08:52.279
I'm a GP working with Erika.

01:08:52.279 --> 01:08:53.680
OK.

01:09:03.040 --> 01:09:05.600
There is no fear for dying.

01:09:09.040 --> 01:09:12.080
- In the UK, he tried to end his own life.
- Uh-huh.

01:09:12.080 --> 01:09:17.319
So, we didn't really realise until that point how desperate he was.

01:09:17.319 --> 01:09:19.240
I believe that.

01:09:19.240 --> 01:09:21.560
That was so horrifying.

01:09:21.560 --> 01:09:26.640
You know what will happen tomorrow, what's going on?

01:09:26.640 --> 01:09:31.279
Erika explained everything, how it works, also with the infusion.

01:09:31.279 --> 01:09:34.439
- Yes, so, he will feel nothing?
- No.

01:09:34.439 --> 01:09:37.840
- Just like going to sleep with an anaesthetic?
- Yes.

01:09:37.840 --> 01:09:41.800
But you know that when you let this thing run,

01:09:41.800 --> 01:09:45.640
that you go to die, not to sleep.

01:09:46.680 --> 01:09:49.439
And you must be clear in mind that you are.

01:09:50.720 --> 01:09:55.120
You don't make me the impression of depression.

01:09:55.120 --> 01:09:56.600
No.

01:09:56.600 --> 01:09:58.400
And it doesn't look...

01:09:58.400 --> 01:10:00.680
You were deciding yourself.

01:10:00.680 --> 01:10:04.280
So, it's your decision and not from outside.

01:10:04.280 --> 01:10:07.960
There are important things I have to write down for legal reasons.

01:10:07.960 --> 01:10:10.280
- You have to assess, yes.
- The assessment.

01:10:10.280 --> 01:10:11.920
So...

01:10:13.680 --> 01:10:16.800
..can I do something for you, otherwise,

01:10:16.800 --> 01:10:18.960
than to go and write my report?

01:10:20.800 --> 01:10:22.840
For me, it's OK.

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:49.280
It hasn't been a laugh, it's been a belly laugh.

01:10:49.280 --> 01:10:51.200
- Laugh out loud.
- Yes.

01:10:51.200 --> 01:10:53.960
You always make people laugh,

01:10:53.960 --> 01:10:57.640
people like Auntie Margaret, and Simon would start.

01:10:57.640 --> 01:11:00.560
We'd sit at a table like this, I didn't need to say anything,

01:11:00.560 --> 01:11:04.680
Sarah didn't need to say anything, cos the floor show is over here.

01:11:08.160 --> 01:11:10.720
You've always been such a lovely brother.

01:11:20.880 --> 01:11:22.440
Thank you, Binns.

01:11:25.200 --> 01:11:27.560
- Top bloke.
- Top banana.

01:11:50.520 --> 01:11:56.120
Simon will take off from his hotel with his family and friends.

01:11:56.120 --> 01:11:59.600
He will come to the place where we do the assisted dying

01:11:59.600 --> 01:12:01.400
in the city of Basel.

01:12:01.400 --> 01:12:05.440
And he will have to fill in some forms

01:12:05.440 --> 01:12:08.800
because the authority of Basel want him to sign,

01:12:08.800 --> 01:12:12.000
the day that he is dying, that he really has been

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:16.600
thinking about it well again, slept over it another night.

01:12:16.600 --> 01:12:22.320
I want the family to be there to show acceptance,

01:12:22.320 --> 01:12:25.720
to show understanding what Simon wants to do,

01:12:25.720 --> 01:12:28.000
and then Simon has to do it

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:31.160
at the moment that he wants to do it.

01:12:31.160 --> 01:12:34.480
And he has the possibility to say no and go back home

01:12:34.480 --> 01:12:36.920
until the very last moment.

01:12:36.920 --> 01:12:40.760
Even when the medicine is in the bag already

01:12:40.760 --> 01:12:43.080
and the perfusion is closed,

01:12:43.080 --> 01:12:46.400
and he, all of a sudden, is afraid of opening it,

01:12:46.400 --> 01:12:50.880
no problem, nobody's angry, he could go back home any time.

01:13:31.040 --> 01:13:32.920
We hang this up.

01:13:41.320 --> 01:13:46.600
We have to prove to the authorities that this person has opened the drip

01:13:46.600 --> 01:13:51.800
himself or herself, and you can only prove that by doing a little film.

01:14:01.320 --> 01:14:05.560
Yeah? OK, so we do the questions now.

01:14:05.560 --> 01:14:10.800
I know that you cannot speak because of your motor neurone disease.

01:14:10.800 --> 01:14:13.880
This is why I will ask the questions

01:14:13.880 --> 01:14:18.440
in a manner that you can just show with your head yes or no.

01:14:19.440 --> 01:14:23.040
Is it right that your name is Simon Binner?

01:14:24.360 --> 01:14:26.120
That is right.

01:14:26.120 --> 01:14:32.120
Is it right that you have been born on 2nd November, 1957?

01:14:32.120 --> 01:14:33.520
Yes.

01:14:34.840 --> 01:14:39.520
And you have written that you've come here to lifecircle

01:14:39.520 --> 01:14:44.280
to end your life because you have this very bad motor neurone disease,

01:14:44.280 --> 01:14:48.160
very progressed, is that right?

01:14:49.360 --> 01:14:54.400
Yes. I have put the perfusion into your brain.

01:14:54.400 --> 01:14:58.320
There is a medication in the perfusion now.

01:14:58.320 --> 01:15:02.720
And I have told you that you will die if you open it.

01:15:02.720 --> 01:15:06.600
Do you know that you will die if you open this perfusion?

01:15:06.600 --> 01:15:08.720
Yes, yes.

01:15:08.720 --> 01:15:11.920
So, Simon, it is now...

01:15:11.920 --> 01:15:13.680
What time is it?

01:15:13.680 --> 01:15:16.240
9.38.

01:15:17.520 --> 01:15:22.120
If you would like to die, you are allowed to open the perfusion now.

01:15:33.160 --> 01:15:36.080
'Hi, Debbie. It's Simon here.

01:15:37.800 --> 01:15:40.080
'I've loved you very, very much, Debbie.

01:15:41.600 --> 01:15:44.880
'I haven't deserved you, or Hannah or Zoe.

01:15:46.160 --> 01:15:48.960
'Such loving and caring young ladies.

01:15:48.960 --> 01:15:52.520
'And I've been such a grumpy Gruffalo for much of the time.

01:15:54.040 --> 01:15:55.760
'But I really love you, Debbie.

01:15:57.000 --> 01:16:00.120
'We've had such a fun and laughter-filled marriage.

01:16:00.120 --> 01:16:03.160
'We were really blessed to have found one another.

01:16:05.080 --> 01:16:08.680
'The one blessing of a slow decline is that we've had time

01:16:08.680 --> 01:16:11.600
'to speak about things over ten long months,

01:16:11.600 --> 01:16:13.680
'not like losing me in a car smash.

01:16:14.840 --> 01:16:18.000
'We've really said everything that needs to be said.

01:16:19.800 --> 01:16:22.600
'You've been a truly fantastic wife to me, Debbie.

01:16:23.760 --> 01:16:27.000
'And I know that you've loved me and I've loved you.'

01:16:28.160 --> 01:16:31.680
Anyway, time and tide wait for no man.

01:16:31.680 --> 01:16:33.840
I love you very much, Debbie.

01:16:35.160 --> 01:16:36.560
Goodbye.

01:18:39.480 --> 01:18:45.680
I remember Simon dying and I know he played a tape,

01:18:45.680 --> 01:18:47.680
but I don't remember the tape.

01:18:50.240 --> 01:18:54.000
I remember the tenderness I felt towards him.

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:56.400
I got him ready in the morning.

01:18:56.400 --> 01:18:58.280
He was still really, really keen

01:18:58.280 --> 01:19:01.160
that his cuff links were put on properly

01:19:01.160 --> 01:19:04.080
and that his shoes were done up properly

01:19:04.080 --> 01:19:05.640
and I found that very touching,

01:19:05.640 --> 01:19:09.560
and it's something I really loved about him, that he was so smart

01:19:09.560 --> 01:19:12.760
and I vaguely remember being on a plane...

01:19:14.480 --> 01:19:18.200
I remember Erika and that's about it.

01:19:18.200 --> 01:19:20.480
Yeah, big chunks just kind of...

01:19:20.480 --> 01:19:23.240
cos we were just trying to get through it for him.

01:19:26.280 --> 01:19:28.760
For him, I think he went to Switzerland

01:19:28.760 --> 01:19:31.120
at exactly the right time for him.

01:19:32.760 --> 01:19:37.880
But, for us, what we had to go through, to end his life,

01:19:37.880 --> 01:19:40.640
it was extraordinarily difficult.

01:19:40.640 --> 01:19:43.400
And I feel I'm still in shock and trauma.

01:19:44.720 --> 01:19:47.840
Somebody's there one minute and then not the next.

01:19:49.600 --> 01:19:51.040
And I can't...

01:19:51.040 --> 01:19:54.600
I haven't got the words to express about how big a deal it is.

01:19:56.880 --> 01:19:58.200
I'm angry,

01:19:58.200 --> 01:20:00.240
I'm missing him,

01:20:00.240 --> 01:20:02.200
I yearn for him.

01:20:03.360 --> 01:20:08.000
I'm guilty that somehow I couldn't make his life nice enough,

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:11.240
you know, and maybe if I'd worked harder and made it easier,

01:20:11.240 --> 01:20:15.040
and hadn't snapped at him that time, or got this when he wanted,

01:20:15.040 --> 01:20:17.120
maybe he wouldn't have wanted to go,

01:20:17.120 --> 01:20:19.480
and I don't think any of that's logical,

01:20:19.480 --> 01:20:23.160
but I think it leaves you with those kind of feelings.

01:20:23.160 --> 01:20:24.320
"Did I do enough?"

01:20:24.320 --> 01:20:28.120
Maybe that's what I'm struggling with - did I do enough?

01:20:28.120 --> 01:20:33.400
Was it...? Did I do enough to make his life worthwhile

01:20:33.400 --> 01:20:38.480
when he had done so much for me, really, over the years,

01:20:38.480 --> 01:20:42.080
and helped me look after my daughter and all those kind of things.

01:20:42.080 --> 01:20:46.160
Maybe, that's the difficulty of what I'm struggling with.

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:04.840
"I cannot begin to feel..."

01:21:04.840 --> 01:21:08.280
A lot of people said to me, "I think you're very brave."

01:21:08.280 --> 01:21:10.000
Well, I'm not very brave,

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:15.000
I don't have...the option of being brave or not.

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:17.920
Then some people say he is brave.

01:21:17.920 --> 01:21:20.640
And Elizabeth and I were discussing this

01:21:20.640 --> 01:21:22.840
and saying, "Yes, he was brave."

01:21:22.840 --> 01:21:24.720
But we have to remember

01:21:24.720 --> 01:21:28.160
that these other people were brave that have stuck it out, as well.

01:21:32.680 --> 01:21:36.120
You see, I'm mourning him as my baby boy.

01:21:39.160 --> 01:21:41.480
He wrote me something on a piece of paper.

01:21:50.360 --> 01:21:54.960
"It's sad, but it's for the best. Thank you for being my mum."

01:22:16.480 --> 01:22:21.840
The man I came to know was, as you will also remember him,

01:22:21.840 --> 01:22:23.840
a force of nature.

01:22:23.840 --> 01:22:26.520
Incisive, articulate,

01:22:26.520 --> 01:22:29.000
bursting with energy.

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:33.400
He never wallowed in self-pity, he was absolutely fantastic to the end.

01:22:33.400 --> 01:22:34.880
He was a magnificent man.

01:22:34.880 --> 01:22:37.000
He was magnificent to the very end.

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:39.120
And he wrote to me just before he died,

01:22:39.120 --> 01:22:42.840
warning me that I would never find another friend like him.

01:22:42.840 --> 01:22:45.720
I think we can say, without fear of contradiction,

01:22:45.720 --> 01:22:48.520
that none of us will ever know anyone like him.

01:22:48.520 --> 01:22:51.960
Si Binner, as he will always be known to me,

01:22:51.960 --> 01:22:54.880
was a guy from a slightly different planet.

01:22:56.200 --> 01:22:59.680
I'm missing the daft bugger. A friend indeed.

01:23:03.960 --> 01:23:06.760
Don't Know Why By The Essex Green

01:23:12.760 --> 01:23:16.160
# If your silver wing is stuck on horizons

01:23:16.160 --> 01:23:18.720
# Catch it when it goes

01:23:18.720 --> 01:23:22.480
# Or they'll take a piece and pull back the curtains

01:23:22.480 --> 01:23:25.360
# And there's nothing left but your clothes

01:23:25.360 --> 01:23:27.040
# I don't know why... #

01:23:27.040 --> 01:23:28.120
Up.

01:23:28.120 --> 01:23:31.520
# I don't know why I don't know why you stay

01:23:31.520 --> 01:23:35.760
# No, I don't know why I don't know why

01:23:35.760 --> 01:23:38.440
# I don't know why you stay

01:23:38.440 --> 01:23:40.280
# No... #
