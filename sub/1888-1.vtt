WEBVTT

00:11.678 --> 00:13.429
My name is Nash Olsen.

00:13.430 --> 00:16.804
I am a PMC... a private
military contractor.

00:17.976 --> 00:20.770
At least, that's what
they call us now.

00:20.771 --> 00:23.272
People used to call us mercenaries,

00:23.273 --> 00:26.567
guns for hire, soldiers of fortune.

00:26.568 --> 00:28.319
Whatever they call us,

00:28.320 --> 00:31.322
the job always stays the same.

00:31.323 --> 00:34.325
When shit really hits the fan

00:34.326 --> 00:37.662
and the military can't touch it,

00:37.663 --> 00:39.456
they give us a call.

00:41.333 --> 00:42.917
The commando team of four,

00:42.918 --> 00:45.253
been together for about eight years

00:45.254 --> 00:48.339
with dozens of missions
all over the world,

00:48.340 --> 00:50.341
never lost a man.

00:50.342 --> 00:52.927
We live and die by our motto...

00:52.928 --> 00:55.721
no one left behind.

00:55.722 --> 00:59.308
These words are really
important to us.

00:59.309 --> 01:02.103
Just like any soldiers,

01:02.104 --> 01:05.147
we know the risk of each mission.

01:05.147 --> 01:08.067
But we also know and
trust each other

01:08.068 --> 01:10.771
with our lives every single day.

01:12.656 --> 01:15.157
That is until the day you wake up

01:15.158 --> 01:17.285
and you realize

01:17.286 --> 01:20.913
that you are in way over your head

01:20.914 --> 01:23.537
and there is no one who can help.

01:25.085 --> 01:27.253
This is our story.

01:29.000 --> 01:35.074
Advertise your product or brand here

01:37.848 --> 01:40.016
Have a seat, Nash.

01:41.476 --> 01:43.352
Let's get down to business.

01:43.353 --> 01:46.939
I'd like to introduce
you to Mohamed Asan,

01:46.940 --> 01:50.144
or T3, as the boys in DC call him.

01:52.362 --> 01:54.280
Number three on the
Al-Qaeda most-wanted list.

01:54.281 --> 01:57.575
Very well-trained,
very difficult to track.

01:57.576 --> 02:00.161
CIA's been following
this guy for two years.

02:00.162 --> 02:01.871
Every time they think
they have him...

02:01.872 --> 02:04.081
poof, he just disappears.

02:04.082 --> 02:06.626
The man's a fucking ghost.

02:06.627 --> 02:10.880
He travels in small groups, often with
women and children to avoid air strikes.

02:10.881 --> 02:14.008
We've currently got intel that
he's leading a small force

02:14.009 --> 02:17.637
operating out of the lower
quadrant of Sector 4.

02:17.638 --> 02:19.681
Sector 4, sir?

02:24.227 --> 02:26.020
Why?

02:26.021 --> 02:27.438
That a problem?

02:27.439 --> 02:30.149
It's a mess down there, sir.
It's the red zone.

02:30.150 --> 02:33.069
That's why they called us.

02:33.070 --> 02:34.070
When do we leave?

02:34.071 --> 02:38.199
ASAP. Get your team together.

02:38.200 --> 02:39.902
Copy that.

03:33.046 --> 03:35.214
Commander Reynolds on deck.

03:46.476 --> 03:49.520
Confirming two souls on
board, dark-colored pickup,

03:49.521 --> 03:51.355
traveling west-bound
towards village.

03:51.356 --> 03:53.729
Keep your eyes on the target.

04:03.827 --> 04:07.163
Do we have confirmation
Tango 3 is in the vehicle?

04:07.164 --> 04:09.366
It's now confirmed
Tango 3 is on board.

04:23.346 --> 04:25.890
We have visual on the target.

04:25.891 --> 04:28.844
- Scramble the jets.
- Sir.

04:33.482 --> 04:36.358
Countdown 55, space checker
at transponder setting

04:36.359 --> 04:39.403
03 Alpha, 4750.

04:54.586 --> 04:57.546
All right, target one

04:57.547 --> 05:00.257
by the entrance.

05:00.258 --> 05:02.718
- Three plus...
- I'm picking up a signal.

05:02.719 --> 05:05.095
It looks like we've got some
friendlies in Sector 4.

05:05.096 --> 05:07.640
Sector 4? We don't have
anybody in Sector 4.

05:07.641 --> 05:10.060
We have guys over in Sector 5.
4 should be clear.

05:12.395 --> 05:14.973
All right, what do you have for me?

05:16.650 --> 05:18.108
Target one,

05:18.109 --> 05:20.903
by the entrance.

05:20.904 --> 05:23.531
Three plus down.

05:23.532 --> 05:25.530
Target one.

05:27.118 --> 05:28.661
Three plus down.

05:28.662 --> 05:31.081
I am showing something
from that area, sir.

05:36.670 --> 05:40.172
Those are our GPS signals.

05:40.173 --> 05:42.508
A team of four?

05:42.509 --> 05:45.758
- All right, let me contact I-Corps.
- Sir.

05:49.641 --> 05:54.436
All right then. Wind,
three knots east-west.

05:54.437 --> 05:56.772
The wind...

05:56.773 --> 05:59.101
three knots east-west.

06:04.364 --> 06:06.441
There's no way we could be
positive it's our guys.

06:08.076 --> 06:10.452
All right, and target two...

06:10.453 --> 06:15.284
four feet left to target one.

06:16.293 --> 06:18.043
Target two acquired.

06:18.044 --> 06:20.337
We have degree coordinates
on that target.

06:20.338 --> 06:23.173
Confirming the grid, 68-niner 517.

06:23.174 --> 06:25.634
This could be Al-Qaeda
trying to throw us off.

06:25.635 --> 06:28.634
Understood, sir.
Proceeding with the strike.

06:35.437 --> 06:38.230
All right, boss,
ready for your call.

06:38.231 --> 06:39.603
Fire.

06:57.667 --> 07:00.211
We've got heavy contact!

07:11.973 --> 07:13.974
Shit!

07:13.975 --> 07:15.677
Ahh!

07:19.356 --> 07:21.482
Oh shit! What was that?!

07:21.483 --> 07:22.684
Air strike!

07:27.614 --> 07:29.031
What the fuck was that?

07:29.032 --> 07:31.200
Where the hell did all
these people come from?

07:34.204 --> 07:36.873
- I'm on red! Cover me, Scott!
- I got it, I got it!

07:40.669 --> 07:42.711
On the ground! I'm green. Clear!

07:42.712 --> 07:44.755
- Ah!
- Copy that!

07:44.756 --> 07:48.051
- Cover me!
- Watch out!

07:49.803 --> 07:51.303
Ah!

07:51.304 --> 07:53.757
- Move into the cave!
- Go! Moving!

08:00.313 --> 08:01.935
Go!

08:04.192 --> 08:06.568
Go, let's get to the cave!

08:06.569 --> 08:08.771
Roger that! Moving.

08:12.200 --> 08:13.283
Let's go.

08:13.284 --> 08:16.328
- Shit! Ahhh!
- Shit.

08:16.329 --> 08:19.623
- We've got one man down!
- Nash, I'm hit.

08:19.624 --> 08:21.250
- Nash, Nash...
- I got you, I got you.

08:21.251 --> 08:24.204
Okay! Ahh!

08:27.590 --> 08:29.842
Oh, shit!

08:29.843 --> 08:31.590
Son of a...

08:32.511 --> 08:34.596
- Put pressure.
- Shit!

08:34.597 --> 08:37.140
I got you.

08:38.308 --> 08:41.638
- Put pressure on that!
- Yeah, I can make it. Yeah.

08:43.940 --> 08:48.152
We got heavy contact! Green 745.

08:48.153 --> 08:50.902
- All right, let's go! Move move move!
- My leg!

09:02.292 --> 09:03.625
Oh, Nash!

09:03.626 --> 09:05.335
What the fuck was that?

09:05.336 --> 09:06.962
Fuck Al-Qaeda.

09:06.963 --> 09:08.631
Guys, what's your status?

09:10.467 --> 09:12.089
What's your status?

09:12.927 --> 09:15.129
I got contact left!

09:15.972 --> 09:17.799
Contact right, contact right!

09:19.100 --> 09:21.268
Allahu akbar!

09:24.230 --> 09:26.482
They're everywhere!

09:26.483 --> 09:28.481
Nash, what's your location?

09:37.035 --> 09:39.579
Steve, what's your location?

09:40.663 --> 09:42.991
What's your location?

09:54.511 --> 09:56.338
Hold on, I'm coming for you.

10:42.517 --> 10:46.311
Pizza! Pizza! Pizza!

10:46.312 --> 10:48.480
No running in the house.

10:54.529 --> 10:56.780
I like what you did with the house.

10:56.781 --> 10:58.532
Thanks! I know I shouldn't

10:58.533 --> 11:00.367
spend the money, but I get lonely.

11:00.368 --> 11:02.369
He's gone for months at a time.

11:02.370 --> 11:04.955
I have to find some way to
keep myself from going crazy.

11:04.956 --> 11:07.249
Think you're going crazy?

11:07.250 --> 11:10.377
It's been over three
months since Scott left.

11:10.378 --> 11:13.463
That's how long it's
been since I've had sex.

11:13.464 --> 11:16.466
Try living in the same house
as your ex-husband and his son

11:16.467 --> 11:19.469
- and see how great your sex life is.
- Oh, no way.

11:19.470 --> 11:23.182
I don't know. After
this mission's over,

11:23.183 --> 11:25.559
I only want three things...

11:25.560 --> 11:29.479
peace, love...

11:29.480 --> 11:31.023
and sex.

11:31.024 --> 11:34.234
Yeah, I want more sex.

11:34.235 --> 11:36.945
- Pizza pizza!
- This is so good, guys.

11:36.946 --> 11:39.069
Thanks, Mom!

11:45.371 --> 11:47.164
It's 20 individuals.

11:47.165 --> 11:49.959
Roger tally. Right door.

12:31.376 --> 12:33.624
American.

12:49.310 --> 12:51.853
clear, anytime, come
in on that road.

12:51.854 --> 12:54.056
I got individuals everywhere.

15:00.400 --> 15:02.526
Alpha 4, we've got confirmation

15:02.527 --> 15:05.105
of friendly in the area, running
north away from the village.

16:32.283 --> 16:34.235
I love you, Dad.

16:40.791 --> 16:43.585
Your son needs you.

16:53.930 --> 16:55.847
Keep eyes on target.

16:55.848 --> 16:59.100
Roger. What's your location.

16:59.101 --> 17:00.977
Charlie 5, Charlie 6 has got bingo.

17:00.978 --> 17:04.814
Charlie 1 through
6, return to base.

17:04.815 --> 17:07.983
7-India-53, one length to location.

17:07.984 --> 17:10.983
You have the call.
They're on their way, sir.

17:55.741 --> 17:57.739
All right, let's pump him up.

18:17.930 --> 18:20.307
I have an update on
Operation Mikaela, sir.

18:20.308 --> 18:22.017
- Let's have it!
- The enemy focused

18:22.018 --> 18:24.227
most of their strength on
this area during the attack.

18:24.228 --> 18:26.021
Much higher numbers
than we anticipated.

18:26.022 --> 18:27.439
Okay, what about the target?

18:27.440 --> 18:29.566
Unfortunately, the
target escaped, sir.

18:29.567 --> 18:31.359
What's the status
of the contractors?

18:31.360 --> 18:33.486
We received a friendly
GPS signal in the area.

18:33.487 --> 18:35.488
We had no way of knowing
it was the contractors,

18:35.489 --> 18:38.575
so we proceeded with the air strike.
We lost all of them but one.

18:38.576 --> 18:41.536
- What the fuck just happened?!
- I just heard it myself.

18:41.537 --> 18:43.121
I don't know all the details yet.

18:43.122 --> 18:45.332
The details are simple...
you're in charge

18:45.333 --> 18:46.916
of the private fucking contractors,

18:46.917 --> 18:48.877
and they got in the
middle of a fire zone

18:48.878 --> 18:50.462
when we launched an air strike!

18:50.463 --> 18:52.172
We may have just
killed our own men.

18:52.173 --> 18:54.257
It'll be taken care of.

18:54.258 --> 18:56.085
Son of a bitch.

19:45.601 --> 19:47.519
I'm hit!

19:47.520 --> 19:49.518
Nash, I'm hit!

20:24.515 --> 20:26.808
A knock would be more appropriate,

20:26.809 --> 20:29.307
if you don't mind.

20:34.567 --> 20:36.818
Roger that.

20:36.819 --> 20:38.069
Where's Max?

20:38.070 --> 20:39.529
He's out back playing.

20:39.530 --> 20:42.657
You know, he asks about you a lot.

20:42.658 --> 20:46.035
I'm running out of excuses.

20:46.036 --> 20:50.081
When are you going to stop
blaming yourself for the past

20:50.082 --> 20:53.081
and start being a better
father to your son?

20:56.172 --> 20:59.251
It's not too late
for that, you know?

21:01.552 --> 21:03.504
I'm working on it, okay?

21:15.024 --> 21:16.350
Dad!

21:26.827 --> 21:28.495
- Dad?
- Buddy?

21:28.496 --> 21:31.498
Do you know that the Grand
Canyon's over 6,000 feet deep,

21:31.499 --> 21:33.541
and over 20 football fields

21:33.542 --> 21:36.002
and 277 miles long?

21:36.003 --> 21:37.754
No, I didn't know that.

21:37.755 --> 21:39.673
- You didn't?
- No.

21:41.425 --> 21:44.511
But you said we can go to
the Grand Canyon one day.

21:44.512 --> 21:46.262
You know what?

21:46.263 --> 21:49.307
I know I promised you we'd
go to the Grand Canyon.

21:49.308 --> 21:52.560
You know? But I'm telling you...

21:52.561 --> 21:54.938
I promise, okay?

21:54.939 --> 21:56.561
Okay.

21:59.401 --> 22:02.650
Oh, I love you, buddy. Come here.

22:08.619 --> 22:10.571
I love you, Dad.

26:21.288 --> 26:22.580
You have a phone call, boss.

26:22.581 --> 26:24.249
Thank you, Jacob.

26:25.167 --> 26:26.751
Nash?

26:26.752 --> 26:29.671
Sir, I just received an
email, I don't know from who.

26:31.423 --> 26:32.840
It's a video, sir.

26:34.384 --> 26:35.836
Excuse me?

26:37.513 --> 26:39.556
They're alive, sir.

26:40.390 --> 26:42.600
I see.

26:42.601 --> 26:45.520
And what exactly would you
like us to do about it?

26:45.521 --> 26:48.356
We need to get them out, sir.
We don't have much time.

26:48.357 --> 26:49.857
Mikaela was classified.

26:49.858 --> 26:51.692
There's no way we can go back now.

26:51.693 --> 26:53.861
Sir, you're telling me you
know my men are alive

26:53.862 --> 26:57.073
and you're not going to do
anything about it, right?

26:57.074 --> 27:00.201
You know what you're getting into
every time you accept a mission.

27:00.202 --> 27:01.911
That's the life you chose.

27:01.912 --> 27:04.455
That's why you're making
the big bucks, pal.

27:04.456 --> 27:08.960
No one gets left behind, sir.

27:08.961 --> 27:11.212
You're not soldiers,
you're mercenaries.

27:11.213 --> 27:13.131
No one cares about a
team of hired guns

27:13.132 --> 27:15.550
getting stuck behind enemy lines.

27:15.551 --> 27:17.635
You know what?

27:17.636 --> 27:19.887
The more I think back
to that mission...

27:19.888 --> 27:22.056
the air strikes,

27:22.057 --> 27:25.476
the men that were not
supposed to be there...

27:25.477 --> 27:29.230
the more I think you're
covering up something, sir.

27:29.231 --> 27:31.809
I'm sorry, Nash. There's
nothing I can do.

27:39.908 --> 27:41.655
He's going back.

27:42.744 --> 27:44.036
This is Aisha Nasser,

27:44.037 --> 27:47.415
reporting live from the
Afghanistan/Pakistan border,

27:47.416 --> 27:50.084
a region now referred
to as Sector 4.

27:50.085 --> 27:52.837
It is believed that many of
the top Al-Qaeda leaders

27:52.838 --> 27:54.839
are operating out of this area.

27:54.840 --> 27:58.009
Recently, the government deemed
Sector 4 to be a red zone...

27:58.010 --> 28:02.180
an area too unsafe to orchestrate
ground assaults by US troops,

28:02.181 --> 28:04.432
making many of the
top Al-Qaeda leaders

28:04.433 --> 28:07.185
seemingly untouchable
by the US troops.

28:07.186 --> 28:11.562
This is Aisha Nasser reporting
live from Sector 4. Back to you.

29:59.923 --> 30:01.716
Come on!

30:02.926 --> 30:04.252
Come on!

30:07.973 --> 30:09.891
Come on!

30:11.977 --> 30:13.811
Do it!

30:13.812 --> 30:16.188
Do it, you fucking pig!

30:16.189 --> 30:18.187
Do it!

30:21.903 --> 30:24.363
Chickenshit! Fuck!

30:24.364 --> 30:27.575
You don't have the guts! Come on!

30:27.576 --> 30:30.746
Come on! Gaaaah!

30:50.307 --> 30:53.101
What the fuck are you looking at?

30:56.772 --> 30:57.813
Are you all right?

30:57.814 --> 30:59.565
- Buddy.
- Come on.

30:59.566 --> 31:01.268
You doin' all right?

31:09.034 --> 31:11.328
I can't take this anymore.

31:12.788 --> 31:14.740
We're getting out of here.

31:16.291 --> 31:18.493
We're not going to get out of here.

31:19.628 --> 31:20.961
Yeah.

31:20.962 --> 31:23.210
We're gonna wait.

31:24.674 --> 31:27.134
I'm done waiting.

31:27.135 --> 31:28.803
Nash will be here.

31:28.804 --> 31:30.506
You'll see.

31:39.815 --> 31:41.767
You know, in the war days...

31:43.402 --> 31:45.820
I was in the same situation.

31:45.821 --> 31:48.155
I lost some...

31:48.156 --> 31:50.324
I lost some of my nearest friends.

31:50.325 --> 31:53.495
They were left behind,
but I was told to stand down.

31:55.372 --> 31:57.498
I did.

31:57.499 --> 32:00.418
Not a day goes by I don't
think about those faces

32:00.419 --> 32:03.168
or see them.

32:04.423 --> 32:06.340
If you're going to go
to one of the craziest

32:06.341 --> 32:09.552
parts of the world...
the most dangerous...

32:09.553 --> 32:12.138
you're going to have
to fight the people,

32:12.139 --> 32:14.056
the elements, the weather,

32:14.057 --> 32:15.975
the desert,

32:15.976 --> 32:18.269
the snow, skydive...

32:18.270 --> 32:19.938
by yourself.

32:23.316 --> 32:26.110
You need to get mentally strong

32:26.111 --> 32:28.734
so you can survive
and see your kid.

32:30.866 --> 32:33.410
Make sure you say
good night to him.

32:43.670 --> 32:45.838
Let's do it.

32:55.265 --> 32:57.349
We gotta get the fuck out of here.

32:57.350 --> 32:59.678
How do you suppose we're gonna
get the fuck out of here?

33:01.730 --> 33:05.566
We've been a team for
how long? How long?

33:05.567 --> 33:07.776
Our wives hang out together...

33:07.777 --> 33:09.737
we're a team.

33:09.738 --> 33:12.072
Yeah, he's not going to
leave anybody behind.

33:12.073 --> 33:15.117
I feel pretty fucking abandoned.

33:15.118 --> 33:18.746
Been, what? 70-some
fuckin' days in here?

33:18.747 --> 33:21.081
Ain't no one coming for us.

33:21.082 --> 33:23.584
He's gonna come for us.

33:23.585 --> 33:25.336
He's gonna be here.

33:25.337 --> 33:27.463
Just trust him.

33:27.464 --> 33:30.258
Trust him... he'll be here.

33:36.431 --> 33:38.641
Dude, that's gonna get you killed.

33:38.642 --> 33:40.476
We're gonna get killed anyway.

33:40.477 --> 33:44.313
At least this is
going to be my way.

33:44.314 --> 33:46.690
My kids are not going
to watch their dad

33:46.691 --> 33:48.776
have his head cut off

33:48.777 --> 33:51.275
and watch it on TV.

33:56.952 --> 33:59.036
Nash will be here.

33:59.037 --> 34:01.872
He'll be here. You'll see.

34:01.873 --> 34:05.334
He'll be here.

34:05.335 --> 34:08.629
You just gotta stand down

34:08.630 --> 34:10.831
and be a little stronger.

34:38.827 --> 34:41.576
He'll be back.

34:56.344 --> 34:58.512
You're going back, aren't you?

35:00.682 --> 35:02.008
Yep.

35:08.690 --> 35:11.525
You know,

35:11.526 --> 35:14.855
I actually thought this time
was going to be different.

35:16.823 --> 35:18.741
For the first time I believed

35:18.742 --> 35:21.368
that you were going
to change things

35:21.369 --> 35:24.371
and be a better father to Max.

35:24.372 --> 35:26.874
I can't leave them behind.

35:26.875 --> 35:29.543
What about Max?

35:29.544 --> 35:32.042
You're leaving him behind.

35:36.051 --> 35:38.344
All this week he's been
talking about the trip

35:38.345 --> 35:41.219
that you two were supposed
to take to the Grand Canyon.

35:43.308 --> 35:46.432
That should be your priority.

35:48.730 --> 35:51.774
Jesus, Nash.

35:53.568 --> 35:57.529
I know you could care less
what happened between us.

35:57.530 --> 36:00.233
Lord knows I'm over it.

36:02.118 --> 36:05.288
I really love those guys too.

36:06.539 --> 36:08.957
But a real man,

36:08.958 --> 36:13.128
a good father, knows
when to turn his back

36:13.129 --> 36:16.256
and let somebody else
take care of the problem.

36:16.257 --> 36:18.092
There is nobody else.

36:18.093 --> 36:19.760
You're just trying to play hero

36:19.761 --> 36:21.762
so you can feel better
about yourself.

36:21.763 --> 36:23.555
Meanwhile I'm taking care of Max,

36:23.556 --> 36:26.009
not knowing if you're coming back.

36:28.269 --> 36:31.268
Which is why I divorced you.

36:32.982 --> 36:35.275
We live in the same house,

36:35.276 --> 36:38.529
and I am okay with that,

36:38.530 --> 36:41.654
but don't go out and
get yourself killed.

36:43.660 --> 36:47.204
Your son needs you

36:47.205 --> 36:49.331
more than anyone.

36:49.332 --> 36:51.785
I promise I'll be back.

36:53.670 --> 36:55.497
I promise.

38:29.098 --> 38:31.642
"Dear Max,

38:31.643 --> 38:34.353
I want you to remember
how much I love you.

38:34.354 --> 38:37.022
I promise that when I return

38:37.023 --> 38:38.732
we'll go to the Grand Canyon

38:38.733 --> 38:41.777
and visit all the places
that you can imagine.

38:41.778 --> 38:43.904
I miss you already

38:43.905 --> 38:46.406
and I love you.

38:46.407 --> 38:48.951
Love, Dad."

39:06.594 --> 39:07.719
Shalom.

39:07.720 --> 39:10.430
- You ready?
- Shalom.

39:10.431 --> 39:13.225
You know I can't teach
you how to fight.

39:13.226 --> 39:15.602
But I can teach you how to survive

39:15.603 --> 39:17.396
so you can come back.

39:17.397 --> 39:19.565
Let's go.

42:04.814 --> 42:07.107
- Hello?
- Hey, Kristoff.

42:07.108 --> 42:09.276
This is Charlie.
How you doin', man?

42:09.277 --> 42:12.195
Charlie!

42:12.196 --> 42:14.364
Oh, my friend. How are you?

42:14.365 --> 42:17.868
Very very very busy. Very busy.

42:17.869 --> 42:19.870
Haven't spoke to you in ages.

42:19.871 --> 42:23.165
Last time I heard you
were dead. Mm-hmm.

42:23.166 --> 42:24.958
Sorry, buddy, I'm not dead yet.

42:24.959 --> 42:28.670
Listen, I'm gonna go on a
little vacation pretty soon.

42:28.671 --> 42:32.632
- I'm gonna need a couple things.
- Vacation, huh?

42:32.633 --> 42:36.758
Are you going to visit your old
friends from last trip, hmm?

42:38.473 --> 42:39.973
How do you know about that?

42:39.974 --> 42:42.726
Facebook! What do you think?

42:42.727 --> 42:45.812
So when are you planning
this trip of yours?

42:45.813 --> 42:47.981
Very soon.

42:47.982 --> 42:50.817
No problem, no problem.

42:50.818 --> 42:52.194
Anything you want.

42:52.195 --> 42:53.987
Make sure you take
care of me, okay?

42:53.988 --> 42:56.490
Not like last time, okay?
Don't screw it up.

42:56.491 --> 42:59.659
Charlie, come on, really?

42:59.660 --> 43:01.328
Of course, no no.

43:01.329 --> 43:03.163
Make sure you say hi to the wives.

43:03.164 --> 43:05.999
I am honest Russian man.

43:06.000 --> 43:07.334
Yes, boy.

43:07.335 --> 43:09.003
Yak yak yak yak!

43:10.755 --> 43:13.006
All right, just take
care of me, all right?

43:13.007 --> 43:15.008
No problem, no problem.

43:15.009 --> 43:16.635
All right, thanks,
I appreciate that.

43:16.636 --> 43:17.844
All right, see you soon, okay?

43:17.845 --> 43:19.388
Bye, ciao.

46:19.026 --> 46:20.648
Gun!

46:23.155 --> 46:24.572

46:25.741 --> 46:27.409

Two-round hammer drill left target,

46:47.972 --> 46:51.558

two-round hammer drill. Copy that?

46:51.559 --> 46:52.851
- Copy that.

46:52.852 --> 46:54.394
- Ready!

47:03.487 --> 47:05.405

47:08.659 --> 47:11.536
Two rounds all the way

47:11.537 --> 47:13.621

- Stand by.

47:13.622 --> 47:15.199

Cease fire!

48:56.600 --> 48:58.848
We got visual on Tango 3.

50:36.909 --> 50:38.702
Spasibo.

50:50.047 --> 50:52.507
So you want to buy
some firearms, right?

50:52.508 --> 50:55.843
I have amazing guns
for you, my friend.

50:55.844 --> 50:58.972
Love Americans so much,
especially your money.

50:58.973 --> 51:01.599
So, um, you ready?

51:01.600 --> 51:03.097
Oh my God.

51:04.228 --> 51:05.979
Barum!

51:05.980 --> 51:09.229
Look at these, baby.

51:10.150 --> 51:12.318
Mwah! Yeah.

51:12.319 --> 51:15.405
Brand-new weapon.
Very good in combat.

51:15.406 --> 51:18.408
Quite pricey, though.
Very expensive model.

51:18.409 --> 51:20.994
What about that one?
How much for that one?

51:20.995 --> 51:24.497
Oh, my friend, that one.

51:24.498 --> 51:28.043
This one... a very good gun.

51:30.170 --> 51:34.299
I'll cut you amazing deal...
500 Americans.

51:34.300 --> 51:37.677
Great price for amazing gun.

51:37.678 --> 51:39.053
Hmm!

51:39.054 --> 51:41.639
What about I give you
$200 for the rifle,

51:41.640 --> 51:44.350
I give you $200 for the handgun

51:44.351 --> 51:48.021
and $100 for the...
for the ammo? How's that?

51:49.523 --> 51:50.898
- Mmm.
- Good?

51:50.899 --> 51:53.192
You son of a bitch, my friend.

51:53.193 --> 51:57.071
I'll cut your throat
when you sleep.

51:57.072 --> 51:59.650
Ahhh!

52:01.368 --> 52:03.161
Sounds good!

52:03.162 --> 52:05.204
- We got a deal?
- We got a deal.

52:05.205 --> 52:07.040
All right.

52:07.041 --> 52:09.375
Euros or pound sterling?

52:09.376 --> 52:11.544
Hmm?

52:11.545 --> 52:13.421
Do you take credit cards?

52:13.422 --> 52:15.965
Credit cards? Are you kidding me?

52:15.966 --> 52:18.718
Credit cards! You most secret

52:18.719 --> 52:21.387
in a desert and you
want credit cards?

52:21.388 --> 52:23.556
Cash, my friend. Only cash.

52:27.770 --> 52:31.939
Military caches are buried
all along this area.

52:31.940 --> 52:34.067
Come here, come here,
I'll show you.

52:34.068 --> 52:35.943
There's numbers.

52:35.944 --> 52:37.904
Mm-hmm-hmm.

52:37.905 --> 52:41.783
60° up up and west,

52:41.784 --> 52:43.910
and you can get whatever
you want there.

52:43.911 --> 52:46.788
So many explosives... wow.

52:46.789 --> 52:48.866
That's for you.

52:50.459 --> 52:53.628
How do I get there though?
I need a car, so...

52:53.629 --> 52:55.380
Ah.

52:55.381 --> 52:57.507
Oh boy, I have no cars.

52:57.508 --> 53:01.427
No... no cars. No no no.

53:01.428 --> 53:06.432
My... my cousin Tolia

53:06.433 --> 53:09.560
is fuckin' great car dealer.

53:09.561 --> 53:12.105
He has amazing cars. So good cars.

53:12.106 --> 53:14.440
And great super-cheap
prices for you.

53:14.441 --> 53:16.943
And I'm gonna call him

53:16.944 --> 53:19.487
'cause I care about my customers.

53:19.488 --> 53:22.448
And you're my favorite,
my best friend, even more.

53:22.449 --> 53:24.158
And he gonna give you discount.

53:24.159 --> 53:27.161
He gonna come here for you...
come right here for you,

53:27.162 --> 53:29.288

53:29.289 --> 53:32.041
You enjoy the weather, mountains.

53:32.042 --> 53:34.794
I give you sun lotion even,
so you can enjoy yourself.

53:34.795 --> 53:36.045
All right?

53:36.046 --> 53:39.006
And he gonna come here
and sell you cars, right?

53:39.007 --> 53:41.342
Amazing? Oh, my friend,

53:41.343 --> 53:42.885
pleasure doing business.

53:42.886 --> 53:44.303
Pleasure.

53:44.304 --> 53:46.305
- Sure.
- My best friend!

53:46.306 --> 53:48.383
My best friend.

55:08.263 --> 55:10.223
English.

55:10.224 --> 55:13.226
My cousins do not speak English.

55:13.227 --> 55:15.186
But I do.

55:15.187 --> 55:17.063
They never let me
hang out with them

55:17.064 --> 55:18.856
when they're doing their business.

55:18.857 --> 55:20.650
They say I'm too young.

55:20.651 --> 55:25.404
But they let me come today because
I learn English in school.

55:25.405 --> 55:27.406
Hmm.

55:27.407 --> 55:29.075
How nice of them.

55:31.829 --> 55:34.789
So, listen, I have a long drive.

55:34.790 --> 55:36.958
Do you think this car
is going to take me

55:36.959 --> 55:39.457
to where I want to go?

55:44.383 --> 55:48.094
He says it works like clockwork.

55:48.095 --> 55:50.389
Hmm! Okay.

56:10.742 --> 56:13.070
Clockwork?

56:14.621 --> 56:17.081
Yes, clockwork.

56:17.082 --> 56:19.417
Good.

56:19.418 --> 56:22.792
Listen, Kristoff told me $200.

56:37.769 --> 56:40.980
He says, uh...

56:40.981 --> 56:43.809
they want to know how much
you have in your wallet.

56:44.651 --> 56:47.445
How much I have in my wallet?

56:49.489 --> 56:50.740
Yes.

56:50.741 --> 56:54.866
Oh boy, I guess a
deal is not a deal.

56:56.371 --> 56:59.874
The man who sent you... Kristoff...

56:59.875 --> 57:03.836
they tell me he owes
them a lot of money.

57:03.837 --> 57:06.130
Since you're his friend,

57:06.131 --> 57:07.757
they want to take it from you.

57:07.758 --> 57:09.300
Hmm.

57:09.301 --> 57:12.095
Well, first of all
I'm not his friend.

57:14.806 --> 57:17.266
And secondly,

57:17.267 --> 57:21.142
I just have $200.

57:35.619 --> 57:37.870
They have little time.

57:37.871 --> 57:40.247
Huh.

57:40.248 --> 57:41.916
Yup.

57:45.796 --> 57:47.998
Opa! America...

57:53.387 --> 57:54.839
Whoa whoa...

58:07.901 --> 58:09.694
Check the safety, asshole.

58:09.695 --> 58:10.987
Get in the car.

58:10.988 --> 58:12.822
Get in the car!

58:12.823 --> 58:15.025
Get the fuck out of
here, you bitch.

59:37.574 --> 59:39.401
Allahu akbar!

59:44.831 --> 59:46.165
Salaam alaikum.

59:46.166 --> 59:48.000
This is Aisha Nasser,
reporting live

59:48.001 --> 59:50.086
from the Afghanistan
Pakistan border.

59:50.087 --> 59:52.171
Information regarding
the recent attack

59:52.172 --> 59:53.756
on the Afghanistan Pakistan border

59:53.757 --> 59:55.674
has just been released
earlier today.

59:55.675 --> 59:57.676
It is believed that
following the attack,

59:57.677 --> 59:59.845
three private US
military contractors

59:59.846 --> 01:00:02.306
have been held hostage
by an Al-Qaeda group

01:00:02.307 --> 01:00:05.392
operating in the area
led by Mohamed Asan,

01:00:05.393 --> 01:00:07.895
number three on the
most-wanted list.

01:00:07.896 --> 01:00:10.147
No demands have been
issued at this time.

01:00:10.148 --> 01:00:13.317
This marks the fourth instance
in which several contractors

01:00:13.318 --> 01:00:16.070
have been involved in the
red-zone area in Afghanistan.

01:00:16.071 --> 01:00:19.865
Previous instances left
several contractors dead.

01:00:19.866 --> 01:00:22.364
Reporting back to you.

01:04:21.941 --> 01:04:25.194
I have some intel for
you regarding Sector 4.

01:04:25.195 --> 01:04:26.612
About your captive men?

01:04:26.613 --> 01:04:28.238
Not exactly.

01:04:28.239 --> 01:04:31.116
It's about the one that
got out. He's going back.

01:04:31.117 --> 01:04:33.410
After what happened
with that last mission,

01:04:33.411 --> 01:04:35.454
you're going to send someone back?

01:04:35.455 --> 01:04:37.247
And on government funds, no less?

01:04:37.248 --> 01:04:40.292
No, we didn't orchestrate this
at all. He's doing it on his own.

01:04:40.293 --> 01:04:42.252
And why would he do that?

01:04:42.253 --> 01:04:45.339
Yeah, "no one left behind."
I think that's the phrase he used.

01:04:45.340 --> 01:04:48.133
A mercenary that
gives a fuck. Great.

01:04:48.134 --> 01:04:50.719
If your intel on bin
Laden is correct,

01:04:50.720 --> 01:04:52.846
you may be privy to his location.

01:04:52.847 --> 01:04:54.681
So what are you telling me for?

01:04:54.682 --> 01:04:57.309
I'm just waiting for the right
moment to strike... a diversion,

01:04:57.310 --> 01:05:00.312
a hole in their security.
Oh, I can personally guarantee

01:05:00.313 --> 01:05:02.231
that once Nash is in the area,

01:05:02.232 --> 01:05:04.233
a real shitstorm is going to start.

01:05:04.234 --> 01:05:07.820
I want you to keep me informed
on every move Nash makes...

01:05:07.821 --> 01:05:10.155
every move he makes,
you keep me posted.

01:05:10.156 --> 01:05:11.983
Understood.

01:06:06.087 --> 01:06:08.381
Don't move.

01:06:10.008 --> 01:06:11.960
Shit.

01:06:14.679 --> 01:06:17.052
Whoa whoa whoa,
don't think about it.

01:06:19.517 --> 01:06:22.060
Whoa whoa, okay, easy.

01:06:22.061 --> 01:06:24.480
You won't find
anything there anyway.

01:06:24.481 --> 01:06:26.899
Who the fuck are you?!

01:06:26.900 --> 01:06:28.567
- Daniels.
- Jones.

01:06:28.568 --> 01:06:30.736
- Paulson.
- Fuck, you guys.

01:06:30.737 --> 01:06:32.654
You scared the shit out of me.

01:06:32.655 --> 01:06:34.072
Reynolds gave us intel
you'd be coming out here.

01:06:34.073 --> 01:06:35.574
Didn't expect to see you so soon.

01:06:35.575 --> 01:06:38.410
Got out here pretty quick for a
private military contractor.

01:06:38.411 --> 01:06:41.079
Three of us have been out here the
past four months tracking Number 3.

01:06:41.080 --> 01:06:43.749
We hear you created quite the
shitstorm a few months back

01:06:43.750 --> 01:06:44.917
going after Number 3.

01:06:44.918 --> 01:06:47.878
There were four. One
of us was compromised.

01:06:47.879 --> 01:06:50.081
Heard the screams, but
we never found the body.

01:06:53.301 --> 01:06:55.677
If you're looking for
weapons and explosives,

01:06:55.678 --> 01:06:57.926
this is where you'll find 'em.

01:07:00.433 --> 01:07:01.975
I hope you like to swim.

01:07:01.976 --> 01:07:04.269
We hear you're going
back after your boys.

01:07:04.270 --> 01:07:06.271
It's a suicide mission.
You know that.

01:07:06.272 --> 01:07:09.483
- Any intel?
- Yeah, about 15-20 strong.

01:07:09.484 --> 01:07:11.443
Packed up the village
a couple hours ago.

01:07:11.444 --> 01:07:14.196
Heading to the hideout.
It's marked on your map.

01:07:14.197 --> 01:07:15.444
Good luck.

01:07:28.378 --> 01:07:29.962
Let's have it.

01:07:29.963 --> 01:07:32.548
Sir, Nash has just made
contact with Delta

01:07:32.549 --> 01:07:34.132
and the map's been delivered.

01:07:34.133 --> 01:07:36.802
He's on track, just as
we were anticipating,

01:07:36.803 --> 01:07:38.804
heading straight for the cache.

01:07:38.805 --> 01:07:42.140
His ETA to final
destination is 48 hours,

01:07:42.141 --> 01:07:44.389
if he survives.

01:08:19.304 --> 01:08:21.680
Shalom.

01:08:21.680 --> 01:08:25.511
Don't forget... come
back alive to your son.

01:15:12.967 --> 01:15:16.296
Yeah, sat work has it by 30 miles.

01:16:02.224 --> 01:16:04.472
Keep your eye on the target.

01:17:46.370 --> 01:17:47.742
Hey!

01:17:57.381 --> 01:17:58.582
American!

01:19:06.992 --> 01:19:08.990
Guys, it's me.

01:19:13.499 --> 01:19:15.201
Let's move. Get the guns.

01:19:17.086 --> 01:19:19.380
Pick up the weapons.

01:19:20.965 --> 01:19:23.008
Get the weapons.

01:19:34.103 --> 01:19:36.271
Get down!

01:19:36.272 --> 01:19:38.520
Brad, watch the door!
Watch the door!

01:19:39.775 --> 01:19:42.069
Brad, what's your status?!

01:19:49.827 --> 01:19:51.700
Ahhh!

01:19:54.373 --> 01:19:55.699
For Scott.

01:19:58.585 --> 01:20:00.253
Ahh!

01:20:01.213 --> 01:20:03.040
Shit, let's go! Come on!

01:20:05.551 --> 01:20:07.468
Nash, he's gone,
he's gone, come on!

01:20:07.469 --> 01:20:09.846
He's not gone! Brad, Brad!

01:20:09.847 --> 01:20:11.264
Let's go!

01:20:15.728 --> 01:20:18.646
- Nash, come on!
- No, you're not dead. Stay with me!

01:20:18.647 --> 01:20:20.648
- He is dead!
- Come on, Brad, stay with me!

01:20:20.649 --> 01:20:23.109
- He is dead. He got hit! Let's go!
- He's not gone!

01:20:23.110 --> 01:20:25.278
I won't leave anybody
behind, you understand?

01:20:25.279 --> 01:20:28.406
God, look at him,
center mass! Let's go!

01:20:28.407 --> 01:20:30.908
Come on! Get in the truck!
We gotta move now!

01:20:30.909 --> 01:20:32.285
Stay with me, you understand?

01:20:32.286 --> 01:20:34.037
- Stay with me!
- Get in the truck!

01:20:34.038 --> 01:20:36.832
Nash, come on, get in the truck.
Get in the truck!

01:21:00.481 --> 01:21:03.983
Are you okay, man?

01:21:03.984 --> 01:21:06.027
I don't know.

01:21:07.321 --> 01:21:09.148
What happened to Scott?

01:21:13.994 --> 01:21:16.288
They killed him.

01:21:18.248 --> 01:21:20.208
Salaam alaikum.

01:21:20.209 --> 01:21:22.835
This is Aisha Nasser
reporting live once again

01:21:22.836 --> 01:21:24.504
from the Afghanistan
Pakistan border.

01:21:24.505 --> 01:21:27.256
As conflict continues to
rise in the Middle East,

01:21:27.257 --> 01:21:30.218
the whereabouts of Osama
bin Laden are still unknown.

01:21:30.219 --> 01:21:32.929
However, drone surveillance
has shown heavy activity

01:21:32.930 --> 01:21:36.140
near the the Afghanistan/
Pakistan border,

01:21:36.141 --> 01:21:38.309
AKA: Sector 4,

01:21:38.310 --> 01:21:40.520
which the government
has recently deemed

01:21:40.521 --> 01:21:42.688
too dangerous to engage in combat,

01:21:42.689 --> 01:21:45.650
causing a stalemate in
the war on Al-Qaeda.

01:21:45.651 --> 01:21:48.980
This is Aisha Nasser,
reporting back to you.

01:21:52.408 --> 01:21:55.452
Hey, thank you.

01:21:56.662 --> 01:21:58.663
From me and my family,

01:21:58.664 --> 01:22:00.706
thank you.

01:22:00.707 --> 01:22:05.461
You're welcome, buddy. You would
have done the same thing for me.

01:22:05.462 --> 01:22:07.755
Yeah. I would have tried.

01:22:07.756 --> 01:22:09.549
Okay.

01:22:21.311 --> 01:22:23.563
Raven, this is Echo 1.

01:22:23.564 --> 01:22:25.516
Do you got the grid?

01:22:31.196 --> 01:22:33.740
Did you copy that?

01:22:35.367 --> 01:22:38.195
Yeah, sat work has it by 30 miles.

01:22:40.080 --> 01:22:41.873
Roger that.

01:22:47.254 --> 01:22:49.547
"Against our recommendation,

01:22:49.548 --> 01:22:52.216
Nash traveled to Sector
4 via civilian means

01:22:52.217 --> 01:22:54.218
and began a large ground assault

01:22:54.219 --> 01:22:57.597
on Al-Qaeda forces in the area.

01:22:57.598 --> 01:23:00.808
We intercepted contact
leading us to believe

01:23:00.809 --> 01:23:03.269
that both Nash and the hostages

01:23:03.270 --> 01:23:07.566
are unfortunately D-E-A-D."

01:23:09.985 --> 01:23:12.688
- Hold on, Nash.
- Morning, sir.

01:23:15.908 --> 01:23:18.951
Go on with your report. I can't
wait to hear what happened next.

01:23:18.952 --> 01:23:21.120
Go on.

01:23:22.748 --> 01:23:24.749
It is good to see you, Nash.

01:23:24.750 --> 01:23:26.959
Is it?

01:23:26.960 --> 01:23:29.754
So how are the men?

01:23:29.755 --> 01:23:32.882
I got Steven out. Brad
and Scott are dead,

01:23:32.883 --> 01:23:35.468
but I'm sure you already
know that, don't you, sir?

01:23:35.469 --> 01:23:37.386
I'm sorry about that, Nash.
Really, I am.

01:23:37.387 --> 01:23:41.057
But like I said, that's why you
guys make the big bucks, right?

01:23:41.058 --> 01:23:43.768
You risk it all.

01:23:43.769 --> 01:23:46.771
You are the one who
sent me that video.

01:23:46.772 --> 01:23:49.106
You knew bin Laden's location,

01:23:49.107 --> 01:23:51.567
knowing that I would
go back in Sector 4,

01:23:51.568 --> 01:23:53.694
create enough chaos

01:23:53.695 --> 01:23:56.906
so it would open the window for the
military to move in on bin Laden.

01:23:56.907 --> 01:23:58.157
Am I correct, sir?

01:23:58.158 --> 01:24:00.910
With less forces
protecting bin Laden,

01:24:00.911 --> 01:24:02.954
the better chance we
had to take him out

01:24:02.955 --> 01:24:06.707
- with safety to our men.
- What about my men?

01:24:06.708 --> 01:24:10.044
You used them as bait.

01:24:10.045 --> 01:24:13.047
You sent us on a
suicide mission, sir.

01:24:13.048 --> 01:24:16.548
The only problem is
I am still alive.

01:24:20.389 --> 01:24:23.057
Men like us don't operate
on nobility and honor,

01:24:23.058 --> 01:24:26.102
so don't... so don't bullshit
with some hero act.

01:24:26.103 --> 01:24:28.479
War has become a very
lucrative business

01:24:28.480 --> 01:24:30.690
and made me a very rich man.

01:24:30.691 --> 01:24:33.064
So how much will it take?

01:24:34.778 --> 01:24:36.901
Hmph!

01:24:38.323 --> 01:24:40.157
Nothing is going to change anyway.

01:24:40.158 --> 01:24:43.327
So I want a proper military
service for my two men.

01:24:43.328 --> 01:24:44.704
That's number one.

01:24:44.705 --> 01:24:47.875
Number two, I want a big
check and I mean a big one.

01:24:49.209 --> 01:24:53.835
And number three,
I want out for good, sir.

01:24:59.011 --> 01:25:00.511
I'll miss you.

01:25:00.512 --> 01:25:02.931
Okay, here we go.

01:25:14.943 --> 01:25:18.904
That'll buy your kid a
nice shiny new bike.

01:25:18.905 --> 01:25:21.407
Hmm. It's not only for me, sir.

01:25:21.408 --> 01:25:24.368
I'm sorry to hear that, Nash.

01:25:24.369 --> 01:25:28.372
I had a job lined up you'd
be the perfect man for.

01:25:28.373 --> 01:25:30.750
I'm sure you did.

01:25:30.751 --> 01:25:34.546
I already got a job, sir.
Thank you.

01:25:36.298 --> 01:25:39.047
Damn, I thought he was dead.

01:26:35.273 --> 01:26:37.692
No one left behind.

01:26:37.693 --> 01:26:40.111
We lived and died by those words.

01:26:40.112 --> 01:26:43.280
Turns out, maybe we did not
understand what that meant,

01:26:43.281 --> 01:26:46.200
who was actually being left behind.

01:26:48.078 --> 01:26:51.622
Many soldiers lose their
lives to save others.

01:26:51.623 --> 01:26:54.417
Not everyone understands
why they do it,

01:26:54.418 --> 01:26:58.045
sometimes not even
their own family,

01:26:58.046 --> 01:27:00.715
because they are the
ones left behind,

01:27:00.716 --> 01:27:03.886
the ones that have to deal
with the loss and the pain.

01:27:05.470 --> 01:27:09.765
But now I'm making the same
promise to you and Max...

01:27:09.766 --> 01:27:12.594
to never leave you behind again.
