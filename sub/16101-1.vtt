00:33.520 --> 00:35.010
I like that,
that's good.

00:35.080 --> 00:36.366
Oh, yeah.

00:36.440 --> 00:37.680
Oh, yeah.

00:38.320 --> 00:40.004
Do you...
Do you have." You know..,

00:41.400 --> 00:43.846
Wait, wait. Two
seconds, I'll be right back,

00:45.600 --> 00:46.647
Do you have a condom?

00:46.720 --> 00:47.721
No. Crap!

00:50.600 --> 00:52.568
Dude, I've been looking
for that nightie everywhere,

00:52.640 --> 00:54.369
Are you sure it's not mine?
I've had it forever.

00:54.440 --> 00:55.487
It looks better
on your boobs anyway.

00:55.560 --> 00:56.607
Thanks.

00:57.200 --> 00:58.361
Who do you
have in there anyway?

00:58.440 --> 00:59.521
I didn't even
hear you come in,

00:59.600 --> 01:02.570
Oh, I'm with that Australian
surfer with the neck tattoos,

01:02.640 --> 01:04.084
Ooh! Checkmate!

01:04.200 --> 01:05.725
What about you?
Who do you have in there?

01:06.120 --> 01:07.281
Uh...

01:07.720 --> 01:08.721
Beet face,

01:09.680 --> 01:11.091
You're having
anonysex with a guy

01:11.160 --> 01:12.400
you met in
the Costco parking lot?

01:12.480 --> 01:14.084
I already told him
he couldn't stay over

01:14.160 --> 01:15.286
'cause I got to get
up eariy to write.

01:15.360 --> 01:16.361
Oh, totally.

01:16.440 --> 01:19.330
God, where is that stash'?
I know ifs somewhere.

01:19.720 --> 01:22.724
Oh! Found them!
There's only one left,

01:22.800 --> 01:24.802
How did that happen'?
We just bought these!

01:24.880 --> 01:25.881
Dibs!
I'm ovulating!

01:25.960 --> 01:27.041
What?
It's true!

01:27.120 --> 01:28.610
I never work out
on the fifteenth day

01:28.680 --> 01:30.091
of my cycle because
I get pains in my side,

01:30.160 --> 01:32.766
and if you remember correctly,
Kim, I did not work out yesterday,

01:32.840 --> 01:35.127
What? What am I supposed to do?
Raw dog a random?

01:35.240 --> 01:36.526
Don't be a douche nozzle!

01:36.600 --> 01:38.602
Pull and pray, baby!

01:38.680 --> 01:40.921
All right, Kim, were
you gonna do me, or what?

03:20.240 --> 03:21.207
Three o'clock, dude.

03:21.280 --> 03:23.169
That sleaze weasel's
eyegasming all over your face.

03:23.240 --> 03:24.241
Really?
Yeah.

03:24.360 --> 03:25.771
He I
Hi! y'

03:26.240 --> 03:27.366
Stoplights, huh?

03:27.440 --> 03:28.965
Yeah. Stoplights.
I love them.

03:29.440 --> 03:30.521
So do we,

03:30.800 --> 03:31.961
It's crazy!
Crazy,

03:32.480 --> 03:34.448
I'm Ivan and this
is my friend, Ivan.

03:34.720 --> 03:36.085
Well, hello, lvans.

03:36.160 --> 03:37.161
Hello.

03:37.240 --> 03:40.562
So, we're headed to this little
party up in the hills this evening.

03:40.640 --> 03:41.801
You girls wanna join'?

03:41.960 --> 03:43.086
Why don't you
give us the details?

03:51.320 --> 03:53.322
Is it too much to ask
for a date with a guy

03:53.400 --> 03:54.731
other than the one
I gave birth to?

03:54.800 --> 03:56.882
Oh, come on. Where is
my friend who shares

03:56.960 --> 03:58.928
my mutual suffering
of high self-esteem?

03:59.120 --> 04:01.248
She smells like milk,
puke and diaper ointment.

04:14.160 --> 04:17.209
Oh, hey, Billy, will you come
help me with Max's stroller?

04:17.279 --> 04:18.611
Sure, Kim.

04:18.680 --> 04:21.331
Okay. There you go.
Thank you.

04:24.640 --> 04:25.721
Hey!
Hey.

04:25.800 --> 04:28.929
I found <i>a</i> job on Craigslist
that pays $150 an hour.

04:29.000 --> 04:30.490
It's called Naked
Human Sushi Platters,

04:30.560 --> 04:32.050
I start tomorrow.
You want the details?

04:32.120 --> 04:35.966
Laura, I love you, but raw fish?
Nudity? What would Jesus say'?

04:36.040 --> 04:37.883
Let's leave
the Lord out of this,

04:39.880 --> 04:40.961
Oh, God.

04:41.040 --> 04:45.125
Hey! I found <i>a</i> job on Craigslist
that pays $150 an hour,

04:45.200 --> 04:46.406
It's called Naked
Human Sushi Platters,

04:46.480 --> 04:47.845
I start tomorrow.
You want the details?

04:47.920 --> 04:50.048
No, I think I'm good.

04:51.000 --> 04:52.684
Oh, Dr. Katie's on.

04:52.760 --> 04:54.125
Did you say
Dr, Katie's on?

04:54.200 --> 04:55.201
Hi, buddy,

04:55.840 --> 05:00.164
<i>As a sexpert, I recommend regular
sex once a week, at least.</i>

05:00.640 --> 05:03.723
<i>I! you can'! procure sex,
visit your gynecologist,</i>

05:03.800 --> 05:05.643
<i>and he can suggest
certain solutions.</i>

05:06.880 --> 05:08.484
Oh! Oh!
- Ew!

05:08.720 --> 05:10.245
Max, my favorite shin!

05:11.840 --> 05:13.490
Baby puke is pretty
much just breast milk.

05:13.560 --> 05:15.130
Just hand me the napkins,

05:15.200 --> 05:17.931
I saw Kelly Ripa
eat breast-milk cheese

05:18.000 --> 05:19.331
on LIVE! the other day,
with <i>a</i> pickle on it.

05:19.400 --> 05:20.447
That's disgusting,

05:20.520 --> 05:24.206
<i>It also comes in dolphin,
bear, monkey and worms.</i>

05:24.640 --> 05:26.483
<i>Worms?</i> E <i>w.</i>

05:26.560 --> 05:29.564
Laura, it is so weirdly hypocritical
that you watch this stuff.

05:29.760 --> 05:31.603
It's like an anorexic
watching Top Chef.

05:32.080 --> 05:34.401
Make fun of me all you want
for being a virgin,

05:34.520 --> 05:36.522
okay, but at least
you'll never hear me say,

05:36.600 --> 05:38.568
"I had sex with some guy last
night and he didn't call me,"

05:38.640 --> 05:40.085
or "I got pregnant again,"

05:40.160 --> 05:41.366
or "I got chlamydia."

05:41.440 --> 05:42.521
Ooh! Snap.

05:42.600 --> 05:45.365
<i>Ask your insurance provider
if they'll cover this.</i>

05:46.600 --> 05:48.090
You need it, Kim.

05:50.920 --> 05:52.922
Oh, I really need to
get more sleep.

05:56.120 --> 05:57.121
Hey.
Hey!

05:58.120 --> 05:59.201
I made this for you,

05:59.280 --> 06:01.521
Thank you.
You are saving my life,

06:01.600 --> 06:03.523
Have you seen
the baby monitor?

06:03.600 --> 06:05.523
Uh, yeah, I think
it's in the rotter.

06:05.600 --> 06:07.967
That's what three hours of
sleep a night'll do to you.

06:08.400 --> 06:10.641
Yeah, here it is. Rotting.

06:11.600 --> 06:15.366
So, tonight is
Marc's night with Max,

06:15.440 --> 06:17.283
which means I have
no morning duty,

06:17.360 --> 06:21.206
which means Mommy is gonna
get hammered tonight, Yeah!

06:21.280 --> 06:22.805
Are you sure
that's safe?

06:22.880 --> 06:24.928
I'll pump and dump and use
my new Milkscreen strips.

06:25.000 --> 06:26.570
They let you know when it's
safe to breast-feed again.

06:26.640 --> 06:27.846
It's the best
invention ever,

06:27.920 --> 06:29.251
Mom of the year
right here yo.

06:32.480 --> 06:34.608
Oh, God. Francesca.

06:34.680 --> 06:36.523
"In addition to
my diuretic pills,

06:36.600 --> 06:38.409
"go by the mall
and pick up something

06:38.480 --> 06:41.165
"young and hip looking for me to
wear to the greyhound party."

06:42.320 --> 06:44.004
Will you guys meet me
at the mall later?

06:44.080 --> 06:45.491
Can't,
I have naked sushi.

06:45.560 --> 06:47.767
Yes. And that
woman is hideous.

06:47.840 --> 06:48.887
You shouldn't have
to deal with her.

06:48.960 --> 06:50.325
She has you running
around like a chicken!

06:50.400 --> 06:53.882
I know, but I'm a chicken
with paychecks and benefits.

06:53.960 --> 06:54.961
See you guys later.

06:55.120 --> 06:56.246
Bye.
Bye.

06:56.320 --> 06:58.163
Wait. Breakfast,

06:58.240 --> 06:59.287
Oh, God, thank you.

06:59.360 --> 07:01.522
Thank you. Bye.

07:09.520 --> 07:12.922
Marc, I swear to God, you're the
most unreliable person I know,

07:13.000 --> 07:14.411
Why are you always late?

07:14.520 --> 07:16.921
What do you expect'? I'm driving
across town from Venice.

07:17.040 --> 07:19.771
Well, I've got a million things
to do and that's all before work.

07:19.840 --> 07:21.683
So, here's the diaper
bag, his diapers,

07:21.760 --> 07:23.364
bottles, toys,
he should be fine.

07:26.040 --> 07:27.530
What's the matter with you?

07:30.000 --> 07:31.365
We need to talk,

07:32.800 --> 07:36.247
Crap! Crap! Laura! Laura!

07:36.560 --> 07:37.686
I got the e-mail
from <i>LA</i> Weekly, man!

07:37.760 --> 07:38.966
I can't read it,
I can't read it.

07:39.040 --> 07:40.565
You have to read it for me,
you have to read it for me.

07:40.640 --> 07:42.483
Sit, sit, sit.
Read, read, read.

07:43.840 --> 07:46.923

Oh, I'm in!

08:13.920 --> 08:15.410
Okay, get up,
I have work to do,

08:17.760 --> 08:19.603
Okay. Here we go.

08:20.760 --> 08:23.889
Marc, I thought we were gonna at
least try to raise the kid together.

08:24.240 --> 08:27.881
It'd be career suicide to turn
down a Hawaiian Tropic pro-tour.

08:27.960 --> 08:28.961
You understand that?

08:31.280 --> 08:32.405
Can we gel your scrawl?

08:32.480 --> 08:33.561
Oh, yeah, sure.

08:36.440 --> 08:37.520
Thanks, man.
Sure.

08:37.600 --> 08:38.931
See? I'm blowing up.

08:39.159 --> 08:41.082
What about when
you come back?

08:41.159 --> 08:43.970
Well, if I come back.
I got things, you know?

08:44.760 --> 08:46.683
I think he's
better off without me,

08:48.280 --> 08:49.964
I'm doing
the right thing here,

08:50.720 --> 08:54.406
I'm ripping it off fast,
like a Band-Aid. Okay?

08:58.760 --> 09:01.730
Peace, all right'? Okay.

09:02.640 --> 09:04.051
All right, Be well,

09:46.360 --> 09:48.567
I feel like a big
slab of hamburger

09:48.640 --> 09:50.051
that's been
mushed into a human.

09:50.680 --> 09:52.364
This was, like,
my one day a week

09:52.440 --> 09:54.010
to feel like
a normal human being,

09:54.080 --> 09:57.004
Now, I'm like. seriously <i>a</i> mom
now, like seven days a week.

09:57.080 --> 09:58.764
That is kind of
how it works,

09:58.840 --> 10:00.524
Well, I know,
but what am I gonna do?

10:00.600 --> 10:04.571
Look, lots of women have been
exactly where you are right now.

10:04.640 --> 10:06.324
You can still have everything
you've always wanted,

10:06.400 --> 10:08.971
and your kid is gonna respect
the hell out of you for it.

10:09.040 --> 10:10.121
Huh?

10:10.640 --> 10:11.880
<i>Let's get a massage,</i>

10:17.040 --> 10:20.965
I am so getting one of these when
I get my first big paycheck.

10:21.040 --> 10:22.963
I don't care how
nouveau riche it is.

10:24.200 --> 10:26.726
Oh, it's okay. It's okay.

10:27.320 --> 10:30.403
Oh, God, yes!

10:33.080 --> 10:34.161
That's okay, baby,

10:34.480 --> 10:35.766
I guess I can
breast-feed in here,

10:35.840 --> 10:38.525
And it's the perfect place to find
something hideous for your boss.

10:39.800 --> 10:42.041
You know, it used to
be that a very select,

10:42.160 --> 10:44.367
few lucky people
got to see my boobs,

10:44.440 --> 10:47.011
and now I whip them out
everywhere like they're udders.

10:47.080 --> 10:48.127
So wean him,

10:48.200 --> 10:50.806
Breast milk is free
and I'm broke.

10:51.360 --> 10:55.809
Oh, God! This is so hard. Nobody
tells you it's gonna be so hard!

10:55.880 --> 10:58.645
Yes, they do, Kim. That's
pretty much all people say.

10:58.760 --> 11:01.809
Not to mention I haven't had
contact with a man in over a year,

11:02.960 --> 11:07.204
Well, I think
we have a winner.

11:07.280 --> 11:08.327
All right.
Let's just go.

11:08.400 --> 11:10.323
Don't get mad at me
for saying this,

11:10.440 --> 11:11.851
but I think you'd
feel better if you'd

11:11.920 --> 11:13.251
go back into launching
your doggy mall.

11:13.440 --> 11:15.010
How am I supposed
to do that?

11:15.080 --> 11:16.411
What about Francesca?

11:16.480 --> 11:20.371
What's the point of working for the
bitch if she's not gonna invest?

11:20.440 --> 11:24.001
I just think part of what's getting
you down, Kim, is that, you know,

11:24.120 --> 11:25.849
you're not
really doing anything,

11:26.440 --> 11:28.886
I mean, career-wise,
career-wise.

11:29.000 --> 11:33.244
I have been making inroads with
Francesca, okay? I mean...

11:33.600 --> 11:36.046
Fine, not specifically, but
we're in the same industry.

11:36.120 --> 11:37.690
She might invest.

11:37.960 --> 11:38.961
Okay.

11:43.040 --> 11:44.326
Okay, I have an idea.

11:45.160 --> 11:46.810
Let's get into
some old-school trouble,

11:48.320 --> 11:50.129
Really?
Yeah.

11:50.480 --> 11:53.927
Let's drop Max off
with Laura, get Brazilians,

11:54.000 --> 11:55.490
pick up some
really hot dudes,

11:57.360 --> 11:58.850
Okay.
Good.

11:59.520 --> 12:02.285
Well, Laura can't, She's got
Bible school fellowship.

12:02.360 --> 12:03.486
Oh, that sucks.
I know,

12:03.560 --> 12:05.244
Deena! Deena!
- Hey, Jayde!

12:05.320 --> 12:06.845
Oh, my God, I haven'!
seen you since last year!

12:06.920 --> 12:09.400
I know.
Kings of Leon backstage,

12:09.480 --> 12:11.642
Kaleb still talks about
that night in room 210.

12:11.760 --> 12:14.081
Oh, my God. We were such
groupies man, it was...

12:14.160 --> 12:16.003
<i>Gross!
Gross! Yeah.</i>

12:16.160 --> 12:18.242
You look amazing,
I mean, obvi, you always do.

12:18.320 --> 12:19.560
So do you, you look great.

12:19.640 --> 12:21.881
Thanks, I really need that. I
just broke with my boyfriend.

12:21.960 --> 12:23.564
He said I was cheating
on with my BlackBerry.

12:23.680 --> 12:25.808
What are you doing? You still managing bands?
What's happening'?

12:25.880 --> 12:27.370
I'm doing it all.
I'm repping bands,

12:27.440 --> 12:29.408
and I'm consulting on a clothing
line with a girl from Paris,

12:29.480 --> 12:30.766
Are you doing anything tonight?
No.

12:30.840 --> 12:32.808
One of my bands is opening
up for Bon Iver tonight.

12:32.880 --> 12:34.325
Come, come, come.
It'll be so much fun!

12:34.440 --> 12:37.011
I love Bon Iver, he's so good.
I'm a big fan!

12:37.080 --> 12:38.081
We'll make a night of it!

12:38.160 --> 12:40.481
<i>We can
have vodka soda no ice!</i>

12:42.000 --> 12:43.411
Why did you walk away?

12:43.480 --> 12:44.811
Who was that pop-tard'?

12:45.520 --> 12:46.681
Hold you about her, dude.

12:46.760 --> 12:49.240
I met her at that Type A seminar
when you were pregnant.

12:49.320 --> 12:51.288
She's funny. You'd like her.
She's nice.

12:51.360 --> 12:54.045
I bet I'd love her. Thanks
for introducing me and Max.

13:11.280 --> 13:13.487
What did you say to her?
I gotta go.

13:13.560 --> 13:15.050
Sweetie, I've been
waiting for you.

13:15.120 --> 13:18.602
Did you get me my slamming little
outfit, size zero for the party?

13:18.680 --> 13:21.126
Yep. I went to the
hippest store at the mall.

13:21.200 --> 13:22.201
Uh-huh,

13:22.320 --> 13:25.881
Oh, by the way, Benny the little
terrier's doggy parents called,

13:25.960 --> 13:29.282
and they said that he
pee-peed in his crate again.

13:29.920 --> 13:31.809
Francesca,
he's just a puppy“,

13:31.880 --> 13:35.043
We can'! go against what the dog
parents want, You know that.

13:36.680 --> 13:38.011
You know that.

13:39.040 --> 13:40.963
Anyway, we have
a new celeb client.

13:41.040 --> 13:42.849
His name's Sprewell
or something.

13:42.920 --> 13:46.163
He's in some Disney movie and some
Asian cartoons. I never saw them.

13:46.240 --> 13:49.528
I'm ready to dictate.
All right. Darling SJP...

13:49.640 --> 13:52.883
Thank you so much
for your generous donation,

13:52.960 --> 13:55.167
How are you and the twins'?

13:55.240 --> 13:57.208
I'm sure that
you'll be with us

13:57.280 --> 14:00.762
for our star-studded
spectacular event“.

14:00.840 --> 14:02.604
Okay, what was after the...

14:03.600 --> 14:06.285
Is that a. .. Is that
a baby on your back?

14:07.040 --> 14:09.884
Is it not bring
your baby to work day?

14:11.440 --> 14:12.771
I'm just kidding.

14:13.800 --> 14:17.964
Francesca meet Max,
Max meet Francesca.

14:18.120 --> 14:20.122
I didn't know
you had a baby,

14:20.320 --> 14:22.607
I never would have hired you
if I knew you had a baby.

14:22.680 --> 14:25.570
I'm so sorry, Francesca, but I promise
you won't even know he's here.

14:25.640 --> 14:26.846
He's just the most
mellow little guy,

14:26.920 --> 14:28.001
and I wouldn't
have brought him,

14:28.080 --> 14:29.206
but I had
this situation.”

14:29.280 --> 14:31.886
It doesn't matter
how well-behaved it is!

14:31.960 --> 14:35.009
This is a place of business, You can't
bring your baby to a place of business.

14:35.080 --> 14:36.730
I know. I'm really sorry,
Francesca...

14:36.800 --> 14:39.280
Save your song and dance
for someone who cares.

14:39.360 --> 14:41.601
Just get out of my sight
before I fire you.

14:42.960 --> 14:44.121
Francesca.”

14:44.200 --> 14:45.326
Just go now,

14:47.960 --> 14:50.327
Okay. I'm sorry.

14:51.640 --> 14:55.122
She better be. Yes, Tinsly
doesn't like the baby either,

14:55.200 --> 14:57.851
Tinsie doesn't like the babies.
No babies for Tinsly,

14:57.920 --> 15:00.161
Gimme a kiss. Give Mommy
a kiss right here.

15:02.160 --> 15:06.324
Tinsly, I love you. You're the
only one who understands me,

15:51.240 --> 15:55.006
Hey. Hi, you little guy,
How are you?

15:55.080 --> 15:56.445
Hi, Pop POP

15:56.520 --> 15:57.885
Hi, baby,

15:58.760 --> 16:00.728
Boy, the last time
I saw you this depressed

16:00.800 --> 16:02.643
was when you got
stood up on prom night.

16:02.720 --> 16:03.926
I got it.
You got it?

16:04.000 --> 16:05.604
Yeah. I got him,
I got him.

16:05.680 --> 16:07.170
I don't have my purse.
You got it? Okay.

16:07.240 --> 16:08.890
You hanging in there?

16:08.960 --> 16:10.564
I don't know what
I'm doing, Pop Pop,

16:18.400 --> 16:20.562
How do you lose your shoes
caught in <i>a</i> rug?

16:21.080 --> 16:22.366
I'm starving!

16:22.440 --> 16:23.726
Me loo!

16:37.200 --> 16:38.850
Yeah, marshmallows!

16:38.920 --> 16:42.163
Whoever invented Rice
Krispy treats is a genius.

16:42.400 --> 16:44.926
Housewives, dude.
The undersung heroes,

16:45.480 --> 16:47.084
But, seriously.
How do you make them?

16:51.440 --> 16:52.487
In a pot?

16:52.560 --> 16:53.607
Nobody uses pots anymore,

16:54.080 --> 16:56.560
We'll put them in a bowl, and then
we'll put them in the microwave'

17:00.680 --> 17:02.523
I have <i>a</i> bowl!

17:12.960 --> 17:15.691
Four minutes
and 20 seconds.

17:28.200 --> 17:30.248
God, you've gotta
be kidding me!

17:55.520 --> 17:57.204
Where the heck
are my keys?

18:05.000 --> 18:07.002
Found them. Bye.

20:22.640 --> 20:23.687
Hey.

20:25.080 --> 20:26.161
Hi.

20:26.240 --> 20:27.685
Are there any
more burritos?

20:27.760 --> 20:29.205
I don'! think there are
any more, dude, sorry.

20:29.280 --> 20:31.362
Guess I'll just eat
a hot sauce packet.

20:32.600 --> 20:33.681
So, how are you?

20:34.960 --> 20:39.090
I've been better. How about you'?
How's naked sushi?

20:39.160 --> 20:41.686
They actually wanted me
to be naked, so I quit,

20:41.800 --> 20:43.723
but I already have another
job, Valet of the Dolls.

20:43.800 --> 20:46.246
<i>I think I've seen that on
Hollywood's Sleaziest Jobs.</i>

20:46.320 --> 20:47.731
It's that girl's
valet company, right?

20:47.800 --> 20:50.690
Yeah. $25 an hour just
to park cars, plus tips.

20:51.200 --> 20:52.645
I saw a woman
wearing a full burqa

20:52.720 --> 20:54.085
going into a bikini
waxing place today,

20:54.160 --> 20:55.161
and I thought of you,

20:55.840 --> 20:59.242
Okay, I would love to stay and
hang out with you, sweetheart,

20:59.360 --> 21:02.762
I'm sorry this stupid thing doesn't
work, but I gotta go get dressed,

21:02.840 --> 21:04.410
You know what? Me too,
Me three,

21:05.000 --> 21:07.526
But, guys!
Somebody has to babysit.

21:07.880 --> 21:10.850
Well, dude, I stayed with Max
for the last weird dog event.

21:10.920 --> 21:14.129
No, you didn't! It was that adopt an
incontinent cooker spaniel thing,

21:14.200 --> 21:15.725
and you hit on Simon Rex
in the bathroom.

21:15.800 --> 21:17.006
Shit!
- Guys,

21:17.200 --> 21:18.884
I would give anything
not to go tonight,

21:18.960 --> 21:20.610
but, unfortunately,
if I wanna keep my job,

21:20.680 --> 21:22.364
I have to be out
the door in six minutes.

21:22.440 --> 21:24.522
Please, can you just work
it out amongst yourselves?

21:27.160 --> 21:29.162
Play for it?
I never win.

21:29.400 --> 21:30.606
Chicken?

21:31.760 --> 21:33.569
Fine,
Here. Deal.

21:34.360 --> 21:36.203
You can be kind
of scary sometimes,

21:42.760 --> 21:44.603
No, you didn't do
a bum card, dude. Redo.

21:44.680 --> 21:46.250
Redo. Redo that.
Okay,

21:51.840 --> 21:52.966
All in.

21:53.080 --> 21:54.127
Cheater,

21:54.440 --> 21:56.249
Sorry for not being sorry.

21:59.760 --> 22:01.728
Guess it's just me
and you, kid. Ante up.

22:10.400 --> 22:11.447

22:11.520 --> 22:13.761
Just checking on you. You know,
ifs not fun in there at all'

22:13.840 --> 22:14.841
Really?
Yeah.

22:15.000 --> 22:16.411
Come in when you're done.
Okay.

22:17.320 --> 22:20.244
Hey! You're Deena's friend, Rocking event!
And such a great cause,

22:20.800 --> 22:22.211
It's Stanton. Jayde
Stanton plus three,

22:22.280 --> 22:23.691
Right. Okay.

22:24.320 --> 22:26.084
Yeah. Who let the dogs in?

22:28.040 --> 22:29.769
Barry Robert Philips.

22:30.280 --> 22:33.090
Francesca's one of my dearest
and closest friends.

22:33.600 --> 22:36.206
Of course she is. Enjoy. Thanks'

22:37.960 --> 22:42.602
Who put the dogs in...
Woof, woof. What's up?

22:44.120 --> 22:46.600
Listen, we are on the list...

22:47.840 --> 22:49.604
Probably under Wellingood,

22:51.280 --> 22:53.009
Saul, first name.
Saul Wellingood,

22:53.080 --> 22:54.127
Saul Wellingood.

22:54.640 --> 22:56.802
I'm sorry,
it's not on the list,

22:56.880 --> 23:00.282
Why don't you check our
friend, Leakin comma Rufus?

23:01.200 --> 23:04.124
Rufus Leakin? Guys, come
on, that's not even funny,

23:04.320 --> 23:07.210
Here's the truth,
we're not on the list,

23:07.320 --> 23:10.563
but my grandfather
was a racing greyhound,

23:11.040 --> 23:14.965
And he passed away
due to greyhound bloat.

23:15.560 --> 23:17.642
He was very close to me,

23:17.720 --> 23:20.405
and my grandmother and he
died of greyhound bloat.

23:20.480 --> 23:22.084
They said to
wait up front.

23:22.160 --> 23:23.650
It's gonna be three of us.

23:23.720 --> 23:26.007
That's all, just us three,
there's not a lot of guys here,

23:26.440 --> 23:28.568
And we just wanna
pay tribute

23:28.640 --> 23:32.167
to all of those that have lost
their lives to the bloat.

23:32.240 --> 23:34.766
They're harmless,
I promise.

23:35.080 --> 23:36.445
Speak for yourself.
I'm sorry.

23:36.560 --> 23:39.291
Yeah. I'm Johnny Danger,

23:39.360 --> 23:42.125
You know what? It's fine.

23:42.280 --> 23:43.327
Fantastic!

23:43.440 --> 23:44.680
Yes! Whoo!
Do I get a...

23:44.760 --> 23:46.410
Thank you very much.

23:46.480 --> 23:48.005
Thank you,

23:48.080 --> 23:49.969
All right,
party people!

23:53.000 --> 23:54.047
Your name'?
- Grossman.

23:54.160 --> 23:56.003
Okay.
Hey, $0"?

23:56.360 --> 23:57.691
Oh, sorry.

23:57.760 --> 23:59.091
Forgot my stamp,
Oh.

24:00.960 --> 24:02.007
Thank you,

24:02.080 --> 24:04.162
When you get done with the clipboard,
maybe I can buy you a drink?

24:04.240 --> 24:06.447
It's actually
an open bar, so...

24:06.520 --> 24:08.648
Even better. I can
request you a drink

24:08.720 --> 24:10.688
and then serve it to you
on a little drink napkin.

24:11.480 --> 24:12.447
Okay.

24:12.520 --> 24:13.681
Yeah?
Yeah.

24:13.800 --> 24:16.280
Okay. I'll see you
inside. Thank you,

24:17.200 --> 24:18.281
Hi. Sorry.

24:19.560 --> 24:21.483
Yoga pose, plus baby,

24:21.880 --> 24:23.086
Good for inner core,

24:23.360 --> 24:24.964
Tests balance.

24:25.040 --> 24:29.921
Lunges, plus baby,
adds twenty pounds,

24:30.480 --> 24:32.084
Cuts your reps in half.

24:36.400 --> 24:37.606
Oh, oh!

24:38.400 --> 24:40.801
No, it's so gross! God!

24:40.880 --> 24:42.484
Let's go get cleaned up.

24:45.520 --> 24:48.649
You like being naked, Max, don't you?
Yes, you do.

24:48.720 --> 24:50.802
You and every other man,

24:50.880 --> 24:52.405
Huh? Heel

24:57.360 --> 24:59.840
<i>Deena's baby
workout video, colon.</i>

25:00.840 --> 25:04.925
Bench press
makes baby nauseous.

25:06.400 --> 25:10.325
Keep this on the DL, Max. This
shit's gonna make me a millionaire.

25:16.600 --> 25:21.242
Kim. This...
This dress you got me,

25:21.320 --> 25:23.209
you would actually
really wear this?

25:23.280 --> 25:24.281
Yeah,

25:25.240 --> 25:27.720
People have been giving me
weird looks all night.

25:28.280 --> 25:32.683
Maybe it's my coat, Do I
still look 21-year-old hot?

25:33.600 --> 25:35.523
You look the same as always,

25:35.600 --> 25:37.489
Oh, thanks, sweetie.

25:37.800 --> 25:41.964
We made a shitload of money
for those greyhounds,

25:42.040 --> 25:43.724
I'm convinced
that in our lifetime,

25:43.800 --> 25:46.565
we're gonna see the eradication
of greyhound bloat.

25:46.640 --> 25:48.005
In our lifetime,

25:49.720 --> 25:53.406
You're such a sheeple. You're
bringing the whole party down.

25:53.480 --> 25:57.610
Give... That's my coat. Go get a drink.
God, you're boring.

25:57.680 --> 25:59.205
Are you sure?

25:59.280 --> 26:00.691
I think so.

26:00.840 --> 26:02.569
Okay. Thanks, Francesca.

26:02.640 --> 26:03.926
You're welcome,

26:10.040 --> 26:14.250
First thing in the morning, I need
you to focus on that PETA event.

26:14.320 --> 26:15.765
Okay.
All right?

26:16.080 --> 26:17.241
Hi!

26:17.320 --> 26:20.164
And don't ever bring
your baby to work again,

26:20.240 --> 26:21.685
All right? Yeah. Yeah,

26:21.760 --> 26:23.091
Again, I'm really
sorry about that.

26:23.160 --> 26:26.687
It just, it makes me crazy
nowadays that people have children

26:26.760 --> 26:29.843
when there are so many dogs
that need forever homes.

26:29.920 --> 26:31.001
Yeah. I understand.”

26:31.080 --> 26:35.369
Doesn't ii drive you crazy when
you see pictures of Heidi Klum

26:35.440 --> 26:38.842
and she's bounced back so
quick after having four kids?

26:38.920 --> 26:40.081
HEY. gorgeous

26:40.200 --> 26:43.010
Barry Robert Philips!

26:43.120 --> 26:46.044
Oh, my God,
you're gorgeous,

26:46.120 --> 26:48.043
I'm kind of mad
at you, though.

26:49.120 --> 26:50.610
Laura!

26:50.680 --> 26:51.886
Oh, my gosh!

26:52.440 --> 26:54.966
Kim. Thank goodness
you are done.

26:55.040 --> 26:56.451
Can we please,
please go home'?

26:56.520 --> 26:59.569
Come on. Let's stay. I'm not in
sweatpants, and I never get to go out,

27:01.200 --> 27:03.282
Ooh! He's cute!
Who?

27:03.360 --> 27:04.361
Over there,

27:05.720 --> 27:07.848
Oh, my God! I know!
I met him outside,

27:07.960 --> 27:09.644
He's walking over here right now.
What?

27:09.720 --> 27:11.404
Yeah. I'm gonna go to the
bathroom, Good luck.

27:11.520 --> 27:13.284
No. Laura, don't go.
Don't leave me!

27:13.480 --> 27:14.561
Work it out,
Work it out,

27:19.240 --> 27:20.241
Hey.

27:21.200 --> 27:22.201
Oh!

27:23.560 --> 27:25.164
Hi!
Hi.

27:25.240 --> 27:28.642
I didn't see you coming over here.
I was just texting somebody,

27:28.720 --> 27:33.089
Well, I'm Nicholas, I didn't get a
chance to introduce myself earlier.

27:36.240 --> 27:37.401
And you are?

27:37.480 --> 27:39.448
Kim. Sorry. Kim.

27:39.560 --> 27:41.244
Kim is my name,

27:41.320 --> 27:42.685
Hi, Kim.
Hi.

27:43.560 --> 27:46.325
So, you work for
the Greyhound Association?

27:47.600 --> 27:50.922
Well, I work for the woman who
throws these weird dog events.

27:51.040 --> 27:54.761
And she also has a dog
walking company, so I son of

27:55.400 --> 27:58.688
am a dog walker
slash personal assistant,

27:58.760 --> 28:01.445
slash loser,
peon, mole person.

28:01.560 --> 28:03.767
Did you always wanna be

28:03.840 --> 28:06.889
a loser, peon, mole person
when you grew up?

28:06.960 --> 28:09.361
Well, ever since
I was little,

28:09.440 --> 28:11.966
I've always wanted to open
the world's first doggy mall.

28:12.040 --> 28:14.281
I even commissioned
an architectural model,

28:14.440 --> 28:16.329
What the hell
is a "doggy mall"?

28:16.600 --> 28:18.125
You know, it's like
<i>a</i> full-sized mall,

28:18.200 --> 28:19.690
but all the stores
cater to dogs.

28:20.120 --> 28:21.121
Okay.

28:22.240 --> 28:25.687
Whatever. My plans are
kind of on the back burner,

28:25.760 --> 28:27.091
Why are they on
the back burner?

28:30.720 --> 28:32.290
Because

28:32.760 --> 28:34.000
life happens,

28:38.000 --> 28:39.161
Well.”

28:40.040 --> 28:41.041
Cheers,

28:42.320 --> 28:43.924
To life happening.

28:47.960 --> 28:52.045
Lift the baby
and feel the burn,

28:53.360 --> 28:57.410
Then, go into <i>a</i> slow squat

28:57.480 --> 29:00.131
to get your ass
lifted like no other,

29:00.200 --> 29:04.524
I feel like I haven't flirted
with <i>a</i> girl in, like, five years.

29:04.600 --> 29:06.568
So, you're flirting with me?
Is that what's going on?

29:06.680 --> 29:07.841
You're flirting.

29:07.920 --> 29:09.001
I am not flirting!

29:09.080 --> 29:10.923
Yes, you are.
You're blushing.

29:11.000 --> 29:12.809
Well, you're
sweating profusely,

29:12.880 --> 29:14.211
You're breaking out in hives.

29:14.440 --> 29:15.441
Am I really?

29:15.520 --> 29:16.487
No, I'm kidding.

29:16.560 --> 29:18.483
No. It's not funny,
I sometimes do

29:18.560 --> 29:20.244
break out in hives
if I get, like...

29:20.360 --> 29:23.921
It's not contagious. It's just like,
if I get nervous or something.

29:24.000 --> 29:26.241
Come on. Clearly I'm the
one who should be nervous.

29:27.600 --> 29:28.647
Dude,

29:29.360 --> 29:32.523
Sergei's on the phone with his old lady.
His kid has diarrhea.

29:32.600 --> 29:33.681
Hi,
Hi.

29:33.800 --> 29:34.801
He's freaking out,

29:34.880 --> 29:36.962
Unbelievable.
The one night

29:37.040 --> 29:40.442
I decide to go out since the kid
was born and he has to get sick?

29:40.520 --> 29:43.490
Is it coincidence? I don't think...
I swear he's out to get me,

29:43.560 --> 29:46.848
Yeah, I can tell. I can see
it in his eyes, you know?

29:46.920 --> 29:49.400
You know, with those
creepy, little baby hands“,

29:49.480 --> 29:52.131
He's vindictive.
It's over. It's all over,

29:52.200 --> 29:54.806
my sex life, my guys'
nights out, This is..,

29:54.880 --> 29:56.962
It's done. it's done.

29:57.640 --> 30:00.564
Promise me you will sooner cut
off your balls than have kids,

30:03.720 --> 30:04.721
Oh, hi.

30:04.880 --> 30:06.211
Hi'
I'm gonna get my car,

30:10.560 --> 30:12.562
All right,
we gotta go then,

30:12.640 --> 30:14.483
Yes! We?

30:16.760 --> 30:19.570
Sorry. Sergei
used to be normal,

30:22.040 --> 30:24.327
Kids! What <i>3</i> buzzkill, huh?

30:30.080 --> 30:33.448
But I had a great time.
I'm just awkward,

30:38.840 --> 30:40.171
What are you... What'?

30:40.240 --> 30:42.163
Oh, sorry,
you have something on the...

30:42.880 --> 30:44.325
Oh, that's just puke.

30:45.200 --> 30:46.247
It's baby puke.

30:49.080 --> 30:51.321
My roommate has a baby,

30:51.960 --> 30:54.327
And, sometimes,
you know, sometimes...

30:54.480 --> 30:56.050
That's what they do,

30:57.680 --> 31:00.126
Kids! What a buzzkill, right?

31:01.440 --> 31:02.930
So, listen...

31:09.960 --> 31:11.450
Hey.
Laura!

31:11.840 --> 31:13.046
We have to go.

31:13.120 --> 31:14.690
I thought you
really wanted to stay.

31:15.600 --> 31:17.443
Yeah, remember,
I have to do that thing.

31:17.600 --> 31:18.601
What thing?

31:18.960 --> 31:20.530
Bye. We gotta go,

31:22.960 --> 31:24.007
Deena!

31:24.080 --> 31:25.411
Max's probably sleeping,

31:25.480 --> 31:28.324
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

31:28.400 --> 31:30.243
Let me sleep,
you freaks.

31:30.320 --> 31:31.890
Wake up.
You have to hear this,

31:31.960 --> 31:34.725
Kim was talking to a guy, and
she lied about having a baby,

31:34.800 --> 31:35.801
What'?

31:35.880 --> 31:37.882
I didn't mean to.
It just came out.

31:38.000 --> 31:39.240
But you should
have seen him,

31:39.320 --> 31:41.129
He was really hot.
Like a Greek statue,

31:41.200 --> 31:43.168
Don'! say that. Those guys
suffer from small cocks.

31:43.320 --> 31:46.722
Only because the small penis was
seen as a sign of refinement,

31:46.840 --> 31:48.205
Big ones were vulgar.

31:48.280 --> 31:49.850
Plus the Olympics
were done naked,

31:49.920 --> 31:51.445
so they didn't want
shit flapping around...

31:54.680 --> 31:55.647
What'?

31:55.720 --> 31:59.008
Guys! I feel horrible.
I lied about being a mom.

31:59.160 --> 32:01.766
I lied to get
a guy to like me,

32:01.840 --> 32:04.161
I'm one of those lame girls who
jack it up for the rest of us.

32:04.240 --> 32:05.890
Dude, he would
have turned tail

32:05.960 --> 32:07.530
if he knew anyway,
and that is the truth.

32:07.600 --> 32:09.443
Are you sure?
Yes, Totally.

32:09.520 --> 32:11.170
Well, you guys didn't
even exchange e-mails,

32:11.360 --> 32:12.361
Yeah, maybe,

32:12.440 --> 32:14.283
You're never gonna
see this guy again, man,

32:14.360 --> 32:16.203
He looked fine,
<i>so</i> what, whatever.

32:16.280 --> 32:18.282
Right. You're probably right,

32:18.480 --> 32:19.527
I am right,

32:19.600 --> 32:20.647
Yeah. Right,

32:20.840 --> 32:22.410
Yes.
Yeah.

32:22.480 --> 32:23.606
Right?
- Yes!

32:23.680 --> 32:24.727
Guys!

32:24.800 --> 32:25.801
Kim!

32:26.160 --> 32:27.685
I don't know,

32:30.040 --> 32:31.201
I do.

32:33.960 --> 32:35.803
I've got some
not so great news for you.

32:36.760 --> 32:38.842
Melanie's lawyers
are requesting

32:38.920 --> 32:40.968
that you keep
paying for her facials,

32:41.040 --> 32:42.963
because it was your idea
to move to Los Angeles

32:43.040 --> 32:44.963
and that's what
makes her skin so dry,

32:45.040 --> 32:47.725
But, you know, I get...

32:48.120 --> 32:50.043
Wail. Can she do that?

32:52.120 --> 32:53.770
We all told you
she was <i>a</i> bitch,

32:53.840 --> 32:55.490
Nobody told me
she was a bitch,

32:55.560 --> 32:58.166
Not to your face,
but we all thought it.

32:58.400 --> 33:00.641
So, how long is she
gonna drag this out for'?

33:01.920 --> 33:05.606
Unfortunately, in
the stale of... Gummi Bear?

33:07.640 --> 33:09.324
No. I'm good.

33:11.080 --> 33:12.605
Green. No, orange.

33:14.560 --> 33:18.326
Unfortunately,
in the stale of California,

33:19.640 --> 33:24.601
you have got to wail six“. Now, this
is all lawyer speak, okay? Jargon,

33:24.680 --> 33:28.366
But you have to wait
six months, I think,

33:28.440 --> 33:32.445
from the time you...
You have to wait'

33:33.280 --> 33:35.089
Come on, I just wanna
move on with my life.

33:35.360 --> 33:37.761
I want the same thing, Nick,
You think I don't want that?

33:37.920 --> 33:40.241
You think I don'! want you
to sow your wild oats?

33:40.320 --> 33:42.766
I need you out there, man!

33:42.840 --> 33:44.763
Bringing in
some new pussy blood!

33:45.840 --> 33:48.605
I mean, bringing in new...
Get new.“

33:48.960 --> 33:51.884
New pussy and new blood,
Separately.

33:52.360 --> 33:55.045
You know, newness, new chicks.
Look, my point is,

33:55.120 --> 33:58.727
I've got to live vicariously
through someone. Right? Okay?

33:58.800 --> 34:01.565
And look at you, you're
handsome, it makes sense.

34:02.000 --> 34:04.890
What are my other options?
Henri?

34:04.960 --> 34:06.246
Come on, look at that guy.
He's a hot mess.

34:06.320 --> 34:07.367
Yeah,

34:07.480 --> 34:09.641
He's into some
funky shit, man,

34:09.719 --> 34:13.406
You should hear some of his
stories, they're amazing.

34:14.320 --> 34:15.650
So, how did this happen?

34:16.320 --> 34:19.483
My parents got divorced
and I said to myself,

34:19.560 --> 34:21.483
"I'm not gonna let
this happen to me," and.”

34:22.080 --> 34:24.650
Listen, divorces are
never easy, you know,

34:24.719 --> 34:27.803
I mean, sometimes they can be
Yours is not- Definitely not.

34:28.480 --> 34:30.562
The point is, you need to
take care of yourself.

34:30.639 --> 34:33.246
You know? Do something to
keep your mind off of things.

34:33.320 --> 34:34.481
Look out for you,

34:34.600 --> 34:36.090
What about that girl
you met the other night?

34:36.159 --> 34:40.290
The little cutie at
the bar at that dog thing?

34:40.360 --> 34:41.407
The bloat?

34:41.480 --> 34:44.324
She didn't have the bloat.
But, you know...

34:44.400 --> 34:46.243
I didn't get
her number, but

34:48.000 --> 34:49.331
I know who she works for,

34:50.719 --> 34:52.165
<i>One new message.</i>

34:52.239 --> 34:55.289
Yeah. Hi, darling, listen,
we have <i>a</i> new client.

34:55.360 --> 35:00.287
A single doggy daddy with a
250-pound mastiff named Bishop,

35:00.360 --> 35:02.931
You know what they say
about men with big dogs“,

35:04.000 --> 35:05.604
I think that's the
expression. Anyway“,

35:17.280 --> 35:18.441
Bishop?

35:19.720 --> 35:21.051
Hi, buddy,

35:21.760 --> 35:23.250
Sit. Sit.

35:23.640 --> 35:26.120
Sit. Sit. Good boy.

35:26.600 --> 35:31.083
Sorry. Who's <i>a</i> good boy?
Who's a good boy? Hi, there,

35:31.160 --> 35:32.207
Hey!

35:32.880 --> 35:34.689
You!
You!

35:35.480 --> 35:37.562
What are you doing here?

35:37.760 --> 35:40.331
This is my house!
Are you stalking me?

35:40.720 --> 35:42.882
I swear this is
just a coincidence!

35:42.960 --> 35:45.088
Really? You expect me lo..,

35:46.480 --> 35:49.563
Okay. I'm... I can'!
keep this up, I'm so.“

35:51.160 --> 35:53.686
You ran out so fast
the other night,

35:53.760 --> 35:57.207
I didn't get your number, so I
just called and requested you.

35:57.560 --> 36:02.487
And I thought
that it'd be funny,

36:02.560 --> 36:05.769
And you would think I was funny
and then we'd laugh and ha-ha...

36:07.280 --> 36:11.251
It played out so much
more romantic in my head.

36:13.520 --> 36:15.522
Do you still want me
to walk your dog?

36:15.600 --> 36:17.887
No. I just got
done walking him,

36:19.040 --> 36:22.044
It's a nice place. Did you
just move in or something'?

36:22.360 --> 36:24.681
I'm in a sort of

36:25.440 --> 36:28.444
transition right now, It's a
long, boring story, trust me,

36:30.840 --> 36:32.285
That must be your
roommate's baby?

36:33.600 --> 36:35.807
Hake him to work sometimes
when she's busy.

36:36.360 --> 36:38.044
He's a handsome little guy,

36:43.200 --> 36:44.361
Hi, buddy,

36:44.440 --> 36:45.646
Uh-huh,

36:48.560 --> 36:51.131
Anywho, now that
I got you here.

36:51.200 --> 36:55.285
Would you like to go
to dinner on Friday?

36:55.880 --> 36:57.882
I said yes,
- Nice'

36:59.320 --> 37:03.370
Yeah. And I kinda asked him
to bring a friend for you.

37:03.800 --> 37:06.724
Please go with me.
I can't do this alone,

37:06.800 --> 37:09.644
Sure, I'll be a part of
the get Kim laid brigade.

37:09.720 --> 37:11.722
The friend better be hot and Ivy League.
Did you scratch again?

37:11.800 --> 37:13.564
I scratched again.
Jesus, Kim.

37:14.480 --> 37:17.404
Dude, I had a window. Maybe
I should have come clean.

37:17.480 --> 37:19.721
Why? Out of some sense
of moral obligation?

37:19.840 --> 37:24.323
No, I mean, he obviously really
likes me enough to track me down.

37:24.400 --> 37:26.482
It was kind of romantic, and
now I'm being a sleaze ball.

37:26.560 --> 37:29.245
Come on. Guys have been doing this crap for years.
Hit it and quit it.

37:29.320 --> 37:30.651
It's not like you're
gonna marry him.

37:32.680 --> 37:34.887
Oh! Gosh!

37:36.440 --> 37:39.091
Where the heck
did I put my keys?

37:41.000 --> 37:42.126
Oh!

37:44.920 --> 37:45.921
Yes!

37:48.360 --> 37:49.361
What'?

37:50.360 --> 37:51.566
Oh, it's for
Valet of the Dolls.

37:51.640 --> 37:52.766
You look like
a prostitute.

37:52.840 --> 37:54.604
You look like Jennifer Aniston
in Friends with Money.

37:54.680 --> 37:55.681
<i>Have you seen
The Night Porter?</i>

37:55.760 --> 37:56.727
Are you dating
Marilyn Manson?

37:56.840 --> 37:58.569
Are you going trick or treating?
Happy Halloween.

37:58.640 --> 38:00.244
Did you kill him with
a candlestick holder?

38:00.320 --> 38:01.560
Hey, Laura,
what's "make love"?

38:01.640 --> 38:03.165
Something your girlfriend
does while you bang her.

38:03.240 --> 38:04.526
Are you really a virgin'?

38:04.600 --> 38:05.886
You guys are random.

38:10.480 --> 38:11.891
All right. Watch this,

38:15.040 --> 38:17.566
“Mommy and Me"
is so important to us

38:17.640 --> 38:20.041
"for developing your
infant's cognitive skills

38:20.120 --> 38:21.485
Yeah,

38:21.560 --> 38:23.801
And it's a great way
of training at any time,

38:30.400 --> 38:31.731
Sorry, guys. I'm sorry.

38:31.800 --> 38:33.484
Why is that lady late?

38:33.560 --> 38:35.164
Oh, sorry,
sorry, guys.

38:37.240 --> 38:38.651
Welcome,
Hi.

38:38.720 --> 38:43.282
I just wanna invite you
to get comfortable and relax,

38:43.840 --> 38:45.410
Okay. Sorry, guys.

38:49.920 --> 38:52.002
Okay, let's pick up
where we left off-.

38:52.920 --> 38:53.921
Hester,

38:54.640 --> 38:55.687
Hi, I'm Hester.

38:55.760 --> 38:56.807
Hi, Hester.

38:57.240 --> 39:00.722
And I've been doing yoga
for a really long time,

39:00.800 --> 39:03.565
and I just thought it'd be great
to bring some om to the womb,

39:04.720 --> 39:08.770
As most of you know, I'm
Patti, and we love this class,

39:08.840 --> 39:10.410
because it falls
perfectly between

39:10.480 --> 39:12.005
Lil' Gym and
Survival Swim class,

39:12.200 --> 39:14.123
And you?
I'm sorry.

39:14.280 --> 39:16.567
You could just share
with us both of your names

39:16.640 --> 39:18.642
and what brings
you here today.

39:18.880 --> 39:20.041
I'm Kim.

39:20.120 --> 39:21.451
Hi, Kim
- Hi, Kim.

39:21.520 --> 39:23.761
Hi. And this
is my baby, Max.

39:23.880 --> 39:25.564
And I'm here
because I have <i>a</i> date,

39:25.640 --> 39:27.369
and I wanna get
into slamming shape

39:27.440 --> 39:30.011
and what other exercise classes
can you bring a kid to?

39:30.760 --> 39:31.761
Right?

39:33.640 --> 39:34.641
Okay.

39:46.040 --> 39:47.121
sol"?

39:48.960 --> 39:51.884
You are making quite a name for
yourself with our female readers.

39:51.960 --> 39:55.123
That last column on why men who
are married to high-powered women

39:55.200 --> 39:56.326
with multiple degrees

39:56.400 --> 39:58.243
often cheat
with exotic dancers

39:58.320 --> 40:00.084
to mollify their
own power insecurities

40:00.160 --> 40:02.925
caught the eye of one of
my contacts at Seal Press.

40:03.000 --> 40:04.809
The same publishing company
who did Gender Outlaws?

40:04.920 --> 40:06.331
That's the one.
They're interested in

40:06.400 --> 40:07.811
hearing your book pitch,
Come on!

40:07.880 --> 40:09.848
Holy flying
mother of God!

40:10.160 --> 40:11.161
Oh!

40:14.080 --> 40:17.926
Hey! I just wanted to say you
have nothing to worry about.

40:18.000 --> 40:20.321
You have a lovely figure,

40:20.400 --> 40:22.084
Oh, thanks.

40:22.160 --> 40:23.286
Seriously.

40:25.600 --> 40:27.443
Don't you just
love these classes?

40:27.520 --> 40:29.921
I think it's so important to
have the support of other moms

40:30.000 --> 40:32.446
And JJJ just loves it.

40:32.520 --> 40:33.760
JJJ?

40:33.840 --> 40:35.444
Jessica Jennifer Justice.

40:35.520 --> 40:37.090
My husband Brock and I
were always laughing,

40:37.160 --> 40:40.209
with a name like that,
she's gonna be a lawyer!

40:40.280 --> 40:44.046
And what about this little guy?
What are you gonna be?

40:44.480 --> 40:47.643
Well, I was probably
just gonna let him decide.

40:48.600 --> 40:51.126
Do you know how many kids in my
high school committed suicide

40:51.200 --> 40:53.362
'cause they didn't know
what they wanted to do?

40:53.440 --> 40:55.886
Direction is really the
greatest gift we can give them,

40:57.240 --> 40:59.004
Are you guys
free for a playdate?

40:59.720 --> 41:03.691
Okay, chubbo, there you go.
You, little fatty,

41:04.600 --> 41:05.840
Is that
your friend Max?

41:05.920 --> 41:06.921
Whatever.

41:11.800 --> 41:14.929
How did you do that'? That thing
has literally never turned on.

41:15.000 --> 41:18.322
We have that same one. It sticks,
you gotta jam the button.

41:18.400 --> 41:19.970
Oh, my God, thank you!

41:20.080 --> 41:23.050
So where are you and your husband
going on your big date tonight?

41:23.120 --> 41:27.250
It's a guy that I just met.
I'm not married.

41:27.680 --> 41:28.920
Oh!

41:29.080 --> 41:32.368
Wow! How do you think
that's gonna affect Max?

41:32.440 --> 41:34.727
You know, having
a constant stream of men

41:34.800 --> 41:36.290
coming in and
out of your life?

41:36.360 --> 41:40.365
Well, lwouldn't necessarily call
it a constant stream of men,

41:40.440 --> 41:41.851
I mean, I wish, right?

41:41.920 --> 41:44.810
God, a single mother!
That is a cross to bear,

41:44.880 --> 41:46.291
I think about
that all the time,

41:46.360 --> 41:48.442
how hard this would be
to do alone.

41:48.520 --> 41:51.364
I mean, I know I'm so
lucky to have Brock.

41:51.440 --> 41:53.090
Do you have family
at least to help?

41:54.360 --> 41:56.044
Actually, my parents died
when I was little,

41:56.120 --> 41:57.610
so I was raised by
my Pop Pop.

41:57.680 --> 41:59.011
Oh, my God,
you poor thing!

41:59.120 --> 42:00.360
No, no, it's fine.

42:00.440 --> 42:02.442
I've always
kind of done things

42:02.520 --> 42:04.488
a little differently.
It's kinda like my thing.

42:04.800 --> 42:08.282
Winston Churchill, St. Augustine,
Floyd Mayweather, 50 Cent,

42:08.360 --> 42:12.046
Jack Nicholson, Barack Obama and
my cousin Taylor were all bastards

42:12.120 --> 42:13.360
and they turned out
just fine.

42:13.440 --> 42:16.489
Women carry the baby, they birth
the baby, they feed the baby.

42:16.560 --> 42:18.562
Fathers are
totally antiquated,

42:19.200 --> 42:22.283
I don't actually
think that fathers are antiquated.

42:22.640 --> 42:24.165
Really? That's so weird,

42:24.240 --> 42:25.321
'cause I'm pretty sure
it was you

42:25.400 --> 42:27.801
who helped me come up with my chapter
of "Fathers Are Antiquated."

42:29.440 --> 42:31.090
Patti, meet Deena.

42:31.160 --> 42:32.241
Deena, this is Patti.

42:32.880 --> 42:34.564
Hi!
Hi.

42:36.800 --> 42:41.840
Look at me. After I had JJJ, I just
realized I couldn't do it all.

42:42.320 --> 42:45.085
I mean, you gotta
shift your priorities,

42:45.160 --> 42:48.289
It's a full time job, even
with a husband being a mom.

42:48.360 --> 42:51.523
I was trying to go to work,
then go to a playdate,

42:51.600 --> 42:52.726
then go to Mommy and Me,

42:52.840 --> 42:55.889
change a diaper, still see
friends, I was gonna lose my mind.

42:55.960 --> 42:57.166
I was gonna lose my mind.

42:57.920 --> 43:01.129
Yeah, it does seem
overwhelming sometimes,

43:01.200 --> 43:02.531
especially now that he's
getting so much bigger,

43:02.640 --> 43:05.723
I know, 'cause then they know
when you're not there, right?

43:05.800 --> 43:06.801
Whoa, whoa.

43:06.880 --> 43:09.121
Why are you both
propagating these myths?

43:09.320 --> 43:11.926
We live in a time where women
can finally have it all.

43:12.000 --> 43:14.890
Sexual empowerment, a great
career, money, family

43:14.960 --> 43:18.601
and a man at home with dishpan
hands if she so desires, or not.

43:18.680 --> 43:21.081
This is a really, really
exciting time for women.

43:21.720 --> 43:25.611
Says the woman who doesn't have kids.
Right, Kim?

43:26.680 --> 43:28.967
Oh, you know what'?
I gotta go.

43:29.040 --> 43:30.690
She needs a nap and
I gotta start dinner,

43:30.760 --> 43:32.444
but thank you
so much for this,

43:32.520 --> 43:33.931
And please, promise me
you're gonna call me

43:34.000 --> 43:35.445
and you're gonna
come to Café Chez Bébé,

43:35.520 --> 43:36.567
because you're gonna love it.

43:36.640 --> 43:38.005
There's babies,
and moms and coffee,

43:38.080 --> 43:39.366
and it's crazy
and it's cathartic,

43:39.600 --> 43:41.125
Sure. Okay.

43:41.200 --> 43:42.929
Okay. Love it.
Let us walk you out,

43:43.000 --> 43:44.650
Oh! Mickey.

43:44.720 --> 43:48.281
So, call me next week
or something?

43:48.360 --> 43:49.327
This was so good.
Great. Thank you.

43:49.400 --> 43:50.447
It was so fun

43:50.520 --> 43:52.170
Say bye.

43:52.240 --> 43:53.571
Oh, I think
they are in love.

43:54.280 --> 43:55.441
See you later. Bye.

43:55.520 --> 43:56.601
Okay. Bye.

43:58.040 --> 44:00.805
I thought she'd never leave.
What a sanctimommy!

44:01.400 --> 44:02.481
Can you be nice?

44:02.560 --> 44:05.450
What? Like she was to you? “A cross to bear"?
Are you kidding me'?

44:05.520 --> 44:07.329
Okay, she didn't
mean it like that.

44:07.400 --> 44:10.165
And, you know, I could use
a couple of mom friends.

44:10.240 --> 44:11.241
Why?

44:11.320 --> 44:13.163
Because, Deena,
believe it or not,

44:13.240 --> 44:15.766
there are certain things
that I can't get from you,

44:16.040 --> 44:17.041
Like what?

44:17.720 --> 44:20.451
Okay. You know I've never
taken Max's temperature

44:20.520 --> 44:22.124
because we thought
that you had to do it anally,

44:22.200 --> 44:23.804
Well, she just gave me
these little strips,

44:23.880 --> 44:25.723
and all you do is like
stick it on his forehead,

44:25.800 --> 44:27.564
And she also fixed
the bouncing chair

44:27.640 --> 44:29.449
and, I don'! know,
other stuff.

44:29.560 --> 44:31.210
Christ, Kim,
pretty soon you're gonna be

44:31.280 --> 44:32.964
watching soap operas
in your sneaker clogs

44:33.040 --> 44:35.361
and talking about Max's bowel
movements like they're fine art.

44:35.440 --> 44:37.442
Well, it's not like you don't
have separate friends,

44:37.760 --> 44:39.603
I heard you telling
Jayde or whatever about

44:39.680 --> 44:41.523
your big meeting and
you didn't even tell me,

44:41.680 --> 44:44.001
obviously
way more fabulous than I am,

44:44.080 --> 44:47.289
Dude, we just haven't been
home at the same time.

44:47.360 --> 44:48.486
I mean, what do
you wanna know?

44:48.560 --> 44:50.881
Well, nothing now, because
I have to go, all right?

44:51.240 --> 44:53.607
We'll talk about it
later at the group date,

44:55.360 --> 44:56.361
Okay.

45:11.880 --> 45:13.848
Hey.
Yikes, who died?

45:13.920 --> 45:15.922
Oh, sorry, it's nothing.
What's up?

45:16.000 --> 45:19.004
I just scored us VIP passes for
The National at a private venue.

45:19.600 --> 45:21.011
You're kidding me'?

45:21.080 --> 45:22.605
No, I'm for real serious.

45:23.160 --> 45:25.811
I can't tonight, man,
I got plans.

45:26.720 --> 45:28.802
I got another call
coming in, tchose!

45:29.440 --> 45:32.808
Hey, I just scored VIP passes for
The National at a private venue.

45:32.880 --> 45:34.245
No way, take me,

45:43.120 --> 45:44.929
This seat is taken.
Move on, please.

45:45.200 --> 45:46.725
Thank you. Move along,

45:52.000 --> 45:53.570
Oh, hey.
Hey.

45:54.960 --> 45:55.961
Group date!

45:56.960 --> 45:58.325
Oh. Sorry.

45:58.440 --> 45:59.726
Yay!
Yay.

46:02.520 --> 46:03.851
How was the rest
of your day?

46:03.920 --> 46:05.490
Well, work sucked.

46:05.560 --> 46:08.643
I breast-fed in a gas station
bathroom, <i>so</i> that was awesome.

46:08.720 --> 46:10.404
I just dropped
Max off with Laura,

46:11.280 --> 46:12.611
<i>So</i> you wanna hear
about my meeting?

46:13.800 --> 46:15.484
Oh, right. I'm sorry,
I totally forgot.

46:15.560 --> 46:17.244
Pauline got me
a meeting to...

46:17.320 --> 46:18.685
Can I get <i>a</i> glass
of water, please?

46:18.760 --> 46:20.489
...pitch "Separating Yourself
from the Bitches,"

46:20.560 --> 46:21.891
which clearly
you're not interested in

46:21.960 --> 46:23.166
hearing about,
so I'll just shut up.

46:23.240 --> 46:25.163
Deena, I'm sorry,
please forgive me

46:25.240 --> 46:26.480
for having other
things on my mind,

46:26.560 --> 46:28.164
like the fact that this
guy is about to show up

46:28.240 --> 46:30.129
and I'm gonna have to blatantly
lie to him all night.

46:30.200 --> 46:31.850
I know,
but I'm here for support

46:31.920 --> 46:33.445
'cause you can'! do
it alone, remember?

46:33.560 --> 46:36.040
Great. Yes, I know, but it's
just not the Deena show, okay?

46:37.280 --> 46:38.281
Okay.

46:40.720 --> 46:41.721
Hey, Kim.

46:41.880 --> 46:43.325
Hi!
Hi.

46:43.400 --> 46:44.481
Hi, how are you?

46:44.560 --> 46:45.641
Nice to see you,

46:45.720 --> 46:47.245
Nice to see you, too,

46:47.840 --> 46:49.330
You remember
my friend, Henri?

46:49.400 --> 46:51.402
Right, From the
other night, yeah.

46:51.720 --> 46:52.846
Are you French?

46:53.680 --> 46:54.681
No.

46:55.720 --> 46:58.724
Baby, you are the sexiest
thing I have ever seen.

46:59.360 --> 47:02.409
So this must be
your roommate with the baby?

47:04.080 --> 47:05.206
YEP

47:06.360 --> 47:10.160
This is Max's mom,
my roommate with the baby,

47:10.240 --> 47:11.685
Nicholas, meet Deena,
Hi.

47:11.760 --> 47:13.091
Deena,
this is Nicholas,

47:13.360 --> 47:15.931
She didn't tell me that she
told you about my baby.

47:16.320 --> 47:17.321
Whoops!

47:17.400 --> 47:19.687
Actually, I met him,
He is so cute.

47:19.760 --> 47:21.250
He is cute,

47:21.560 --> 47:25.087
It must bejusl so nice to live
with a built in babysitter.

47:26.760 --> 47:32.324
It is so nice to have someone you can
rely on for pretty much everything.

47:32.400 --> 47:36.530
Yeah! I can see you. Child on your hip.
Born to be <i>a</i> mom.

47:36.600 --> 47:38.204
And I see you.
Mustache on your face,

47:38.280 --> 47:39.805
<i>Profiled on
To Catch a Predator.</i>

47:40.280 --> 47:41.361
Whoa!

47:42.600 --> 47:44.045
Should we go get a table'?
Yes.

47:44.120 --> 47:46.168
Should we sit somewhere?

47:48.080 --> 47:51.243
So, no stretch marks? Not one?
How did you manage that?

47:51.320 --> 47:53.084
Oh, no, there's
a cream I saw.”

47:53.160 --> 47:54.525
Yeah, Henri,
you know what?

47:54.640 --> 47:57.530
Will you help me
carry some drink menus back?

47:57.600 --> 47:58.601
Yeah,

47:59.240 --> 48:01.971
This one' I like this one.

48:09.440 --> 48:10.646
Are you kidding me'?

48:10.720 --> 48:12.563
He could have been anyone's kid.
Why did you make him mine'?

48:12.640 --> 48:16.087
I'm sorry, it just came out! Please,
you have to go along with it.

48:17.400 --> 48:20.006
Okay. You wanna
see the Deena show?

48:21.000 --> 48:22.570
The truth is,
I was sleeping with

48:22.640 --> 48:24.165
loads of guys
when I got pregnant,

48:24.240 --> 48:27.323
But I think the father is
an Australian pro surfer,

48:28.080 --> 48:29.923
Obviously, she's kidding.
No, I'm not.

48:30.000 --> 48:32.128
Obviously, she knows
that the father is Marc,

48:32.200 --> 48:34.328
and to his credit,
he has good genes,

48:34.560 --> 48:35.686
He ditched me,

48:36.280 --> 48:37.281
That's intense,

48:37.680 --> 48:39.284
Well, he just wasn't in
the right frame of mind

48:39.360 --> 48:40.964
to be a father and,
personally,

48:41.040 --> 48:42.087
I think that
it's for the best.

48:42.160 --> 48:43.924
I mean, just because two
people have a kid together

48:44.000 --> 48:45.650
doesn't mean that two
people have to be together.

48:45.720 --> 48:46.960
It's always
the kid who suffers!

48:47.120 --> 48:49.088
Yeah. That's actually
a good point.

48:49.160 --> 48:51.003
Frankly, it's so much better
without him around,

48:51.080 --> 48:52.570
'cause I'm ready to
get back in the game,

48:52.640 --> 48:53.880
I'm <i>a</i> player at heart,

48:53.960 --> 48:56.611
Fantastic. It is hot
how honest you are,

48:56.680 --> 48:58.967
So many women try to
pass themselves off

48:59.080 --> 49:01.287
<i>as</i> virginal,
you know it's not true,

49:01.360 --> 49:03.601
Well, our roommate Laura
is actually a virgin,

49:03.680 --> 49:06.570
If it's true, fine.
But if it's not, why lie?

49:06.640 --> 49:08.608
"Practice is the best
of all instructors."

49:08.680 --> 49:10.569
"Publilius Syrus.
First century.

49:10.640 --> 49:13.291
Well, Publilius, you certainly
can't pretend once you give birth,

49:13.360 --> 49:15.408
'cause you get super loose, like...

49:15.480 --> 49:17.209
That's only if
you don't do Kegels!

49:18.400 --> 49:19.890
Kamikaze shots
for the table!

49:20.280 --> 49:21.281
Thank you,

49:21.560 --> 49:24.689
Deena, you can't drink
because you're breast-feeding,

49:24.800 --> 49:26.290
Remember? Tell that
to Shakespeare's mom.

49:26.600 --> 49:28.409
Ah! Indeed.

49:28.680 --> 49:32.321
In Shakespeare's time, water
was basically non-potable,

49:32.400 --> 49:35.324
and so beer was the only thing
that people could drink,

49:35.400 --> 49:37.243
including nursing mothers,

49:37.520 --> 49:39.761
Yeah, I read that
New Yorker article, too.

49:40.280 --> 49:43.124
Whatevs, I'm good to go.
I pump and dump all the time,

49:43.200 --> 49:44.645
Sure it's frowned upon,
but, you know,

49:44.720 --> 49:48.008
I just picked up a new box of
Milkscreen strips, so it's all good.

49:48.080 --> 49:49.206
Right, Kim'?

49:49.720 --> 49:51.848
Pump? Pump your breasts?

49:52.760 --> 49:54.046
Oh, my gosh!

49:55.720 --> 49:56.801
Oh, shots!

49:58.680 --> 49:59.841
Thank you, Henri.

50:00.720 --> 50:02.449
Pump it.
Pump it.

50:04.360 --> 50:06.488
So, how did you
two girls meet?

50:06.560 --> 50:10.485
We met in college, It was
the same Spanish class.

50:10.560 --> 50:12.847
Yeah, the difference is I actually
learned to speak Spanish,

50:12.920 --> 50:14.331
because I had
a Cuban boyfriend

50:14.400 --> 50:16.801
who really liked it when I stuck
my fingers straight up his ass.

50:16.880 --> 50:18.803
I thought that was something
that you promised yourself

50:18.880 --> 50:20.803
you were never gonna
tell anybody about yourself.

50:20.880 --> 50:25.363
We're among friends, sharing
together, loving one another.

50:27.400 --> 50:29.641
Right. Right. Well,

50:29.720 --> 50:33.008
I, Kim, never learned
anything in college,

50:33.080 --> 50:35.287
because I was too
busy reliving my past.

50:35.360 --> 50:37.124
You know,
the normal hick stuff,

50:37.200 --> 50:39.362
riding cows,
slaughtering pigs,

50:39.440 --> 50:41.169
fantasizing
about my cousin Brad,

50:41.240 --> 50:42.571
He was your second
cousin by marriage!

50:42.640 --> 50:43.926
Still inappropriate!

50:45.600 --> 50:47.523
Don't mind Kim here.
She's just a little bitter,

50:47.600 --> 50:50.046
because I've become
a sweatpant-wearing loser mom

50:50.120 --> 50:53.044
with little mommy friends, who's
lost ali sense of self and ambition.

50:53.120 --> 50:55.771
Well, I guess I'm just a self-rig
hteous, know-it-all bitch.

50:59.440 --> 51:01.169
I feel like dancing.

51:04.760 --> 51:05.921
I feel like dancing.

51:12.320 --> 51:14.368
Scoot over.
Okay,

51:17.600 --> 51:19.125
It's lonely over there,

51:24.840 --> 51:26.126
Are you okay?

51:26.200 --> 51:29.170
Yeah. That? Her and
I just have this...

51:29.480 --> 51:33.929
You know, like witty banter thing.
It's nothing serious.

51:34.000 --> 51:35.968
Yeah. it's fun to watch,

51:36.040 --> 51:38.691
but it's a little scary.

51:39.120 --> 51:40.849
I'm sorry.

51:55.680 --> 51:57.808
Okay. I've had enough.
And I'm ready to go.

51:57.880 --> 52:01.123
No- No- I thought that that was
a wonderful thing to tell him.

52:01.200 --> 52:02.167
No, forgive me,

52:02.240 --> 52:04.641
"Thou know'st that
this cannot be said

52:04.720 --> 52:06.961
"A sin, nor shame,
nor loss of maidenhead

52:07.040 --> 52:09.611
"Yet this enjoys
before it woo,

52:09.680 --> 52:13.651
"And pampered swells
with one blood made of two."

52:14.200 --> 52:15.201
Oh!

52:16.760 --> 52:18.524
Okay. Just because
I know that's John Donne

52:18.600 --> 52:20.090
does not mean
I'll forgive you.

52:20.160 --> 52:21.446
Kim, let's go! Ten seconds,

52:21.720 --> 52:23.051
Ten!
Okay!

52:23.360 --> 52:24.361
Nine!

52:25.560 --> 52:28.769
I guess we got the annoying
prerequisite group date out of the way,

52:28.840 --> 52:29.807
<i>Six,</i>

52:29.880 --> 52:31.370
I would love to go
out with just you,

52:31.440 --> 52:32.521
I would love that, too.

52:32.600 --> 52:33.601
Yeah?
Yeah.

52:33.680 --> 52:34.920
Three, two...

52:35.000 --> 52:36.240
Friday?
Friday sounds great,

52:36.320 --> 52:37.526
Kim, come on!
Okay, Jesus!

52:37.880 --> 52:39.245
Okay-
Sor"Y

52:40.240 --> 52:41.366
Bye, Deena,

52:43.200 --> 52:45.771
Oh, my gosh,
fantastic date!

52:49.920 --> 52:53.720
So, you're gonna drive me to my
car tomorrow, right, drunkie?

52:54.080 --> 52:55.411
Yeah,

53:18.040 --> 53:19.530
You can be a real jerk,
you know that'?

53:19.960 --> 53:21.485
Hey, Kettle,
what's up, you're black.

53:21.560 --> 53:24.803
Oh, please. "I don't know who the father is"?
And then the finger thing?

53:24.920 --> 53:26.331
And don't think
I didn't notice

53:26.400 --> 53:28.482
that huge dig about
me losing my ambition,

53:28.600 --> 53:30.409
Oh, yeah,
that was right before

53:30.480 --> 53:32.323
you called me
a self-righteous bitch!

53:37.480 --> 53:40.563
Man, what are we doing,
dude, huh?

53:40.920 --> 53:42.604
We haven'!
fought like this since

53:42.680 --> 53:45.729
I bought those high-waisted
jeans you said you wanted,

53:45.800 --> 53:47.086
Yeah, and that was
seriously messed up!

53:47.200 --> 53:49.567
You knew I was saving up
for them for like months,

53:49.640 --> 53:52.325
Okay. What is
the big deal, man?

53:52.400 --> 53:55.324
The big deal is that
<i>I</i> like this guy! A ma,

53:55.400 --> 53:58.609
And now it's not just some,
like, little accidental lie,

53:58.680 --> 54:00.045
It's a huge,
complicated mess.

54:00.120 --> 54:02.248
We acted like
total mental patients.

54:02.320 --> 54:03.651
I thought it was awesome!

54:03.760 --> 54:05.250
Well, I didn't, okay?

54:06.280 --> 54:08.169
Okay. Well...

54:08.480 --> 54:10.084
You know how I feel
about it all, you know,

54:10.160 --> 54:11.764
don't get
emotionally involved.

54:11.840 --> 54:12.841
Stick to the game plan.

54:13.680 --> 54:14.966
Bone and bolt,

54:16.120 --> 54:17.645
It's a good
chapter subheading,

54:19.160 --> 54:20.730
Right after
"How to never let a man

54:20.800 --> 54:22.370
"stand in the way
of <i>a</i> friendship."

54:37.520 --> 54:39.010
Do you think
he's ever gonna propose?

54:39.800 --> 54:41.450
I'm, like,
the perfect girlfriend,

54:41.520 --> 54:43.204
I cook, I clean,
I wear sexy underwear.--

54:43.280 --> 54:44.361
Psst

54:45.200 --> 54:46.645
Hang up the phone,
Hang it up.

54:48.880 --> 54:49.961
What's your name?

54:50.640 --> 54:52.722
Rita.

54:53.160 --> 54:56.289
Pick up a new hobby, like
skydiving or din bike riding.

54:56.360 --> 54:58.010
Don't tell him about it,
but just start

54:58.080 --> 54:59.684
leaving your gear
around the house,

54:59.880 --> 55:01.245
When he asks you
about it, just say,

55:01.360 --> 55:02.646
"Oh, what'? That?
That's my parachute.

55:02.720 --> 55:03.881
"Oh, that's my
motorcycle helmet,

55:03.960 --> 55:05.086
"did I not tell you
about that?"

55:05.440 --> 55:07.044
You'll have a ring on your
finger within the month.

55:07.720 --> 55:09.882
Treat 'em mean, keep 'em keen.
Live by it.

55:23.920 --> 55:26.127
<i>You have
one new voice message,</i>

55:26.200 --> 55:27.406
Hi, there.

55:28.360 --> 55:30.966
I was hoping you'd pickup. I'd
really love to hear your voice.

55:31.040 --> 55:33.407
I mean, I heard your voice
on the answering machine,

55:33.480 --> 55:36.086
and it made my day,

55:36.240 --> 55:41.451
But to hear your real,
un-prerecorded voice

55:41.560 --> 55:45.121
in person, that's
what I was hoping for,

55:45.200 --> 55:46.964
I guess, technically,
if it's on the voice mail,

55:47.040 --> 55:48.769
it's not in person,
but I digress.

55:49.080 --> 55:50.320
Uh...

55:50.720 --> 55:53.246
Wonder what
you're doing right now,

55:54.120 --> 55:55.804
Taking care of
your little man?

55:55.880 --> 56:00.681
Using that incredible brain
of yours to finish your book?

56:01.600 --> 56:04.251
Using that lean body to

56:04.960 --> 56:07.440
work on your exercise video?

56:08.920 --> 56:10.604
Conquering the world?

56:12.280 --> 56:14.089
Maybe you were
thinking of me?

56:15.000 --> 56:16.001
Uh...

56:16.800 --> 56:18.723
I would like to see you,

56:19.120 --> 56:21.851
If that isn't clear
from this message,

56:22.120 --> 56:25.283
I am free on Thursday,

56:25.920 --> 56:28.366
I am free on Friday,

56:28.440 --> 56:31.808
Saturday is
a good day for me..,

56:31.920 --> 56:33.410
Message deleted,

56:41.640 --> 56:44.564
Let's see what we're
dealing with here, buddy,

56:47.480 --> 56:48.527
Yo,

56:48.600 --> 56:49.601
We cool'?

56:50.760 --> 56:52.489
Yeah, we're cool.
Good'

56:53.160 --> 56:54.571
You still down to
babysit tonight?

56:54.680 --> 56:55.681
Sure,

56:56.320 --> 56:57.924
Did you give Henri
my number?

56:58.000 --> 56:59.445
Don'! you mean Ohn-ree?

56:59.560 --> 57:02.643
I'm not calling him Ohn-frickin'-ree.
He's not even French. Did you?

57:02.720 --> 57:04.563
Yeah. Nicholas
asked me for it.

57:04.640 --> 57:06.005
Oh, great, because
now he's like stalker

57:06.080 --> 57:07.445
obsessed with me, dude.
It's awesome.

57:07.520 --> 57:09.170
I am literally dying.
Gotta call you back.

57:09.240 --> 57:10.651
We're just so...
It's so exciting.

57:10.720 --> 57:13.769
So many weeks in the best seller
list for an author like you,

57:13.840 --> 57:15.842
I totally knew it.

57:16.360 --> 57:17.600
We're so proud of you,

57:17.680 --> 57:18.841
Thank you,

57:19.120 --> 57:20.690
Are you coming to
Vegas this weekend?

57:20.840 --> 57:22.285
Oh, my God!

57:23.200 --> 57:24.201
Yeah,
Oh.

57:24.920 --> 57:26.206
<i>Mmm-hmm.</i>

57:26.560 --> 57:27.607
Deena Gold?
Yes,

57:27.680 --> 57:28.841
We're ready for you,

57:29.520 --> 57:30.806
Deena Gold?
Yeah.

57:30.880 --> 57:34.202
Oh, my God, I love your column.
I read it religiously.

57:34.880 --> 57:36.723
I would love to
take you out to lunch

57:36.800 --> 57:38.404
and get advice on
a guy I'm seeing.

57:38.520 --> 57:39.567
Sure!

57:41.720 --> 57:42.960
Great.
Good luck in there!

57:43.040 --> 57:44.041
Thanks.
Call me!

57:47.320 --> 57:50.642
Okay. So then that happened.
Do you know who that is'?

57:50.720 --> 57:52.484
Yeah.
She's a really great girl.

57:52.560 --> 57:53.971
Come on.
Okay,

57:54.040 --> 57:55.929
I can't believe
she knew who I was,

58:03.240 --> 58:05.163
Hi, babe. I'm just
calling to tell you

58:05.240 --> 58:07.163
that I'm not gonna
be able to talk today,

58:07.240 --> 58:10.722
I'm, like, super busy, so don't
even try to get a hold of me.

58:10.840 --> 58:11.841
Good-bye.

58:13.240 --> 58:14.287
Hi.

58:14.360 --> 58:15.361
Be back by 6:00,

58:15.440 --> 58:17.124
Okay. I will.
They're very strict.

58:17.200 --> 58:18.804
Okay. Thank you, Pop Pop.
Thank you, I love you.

58:18.880 --> 58:20.245
You're a life saver,
I love you, Bye.

58:20.320 --> 58:21.731
Hi, Max. How are you?

58:22.760 --> 58:24.762
I know, it's horrible.

58:25.560 --> 58:27.130
He robbed me blind,

58:27.200 --> 58:30.807
Do you know that I actually
had to vacay this year

58:30.880 --> 58:34.168
in Palms Springs
instead of Hawaii?

58:34.440 --> 58:35.521
Sounds horrible,

58:35.600 --> 58:37.364
Well, I have such
good taste in everything,

58:37.440 --> 58:39.090
except when it comes
to the men I marry.

58:41.880 --> 58:44.121
Sweetie, she looks good.

58:44.920 --> 58:47.082
She looks like
an obese supermodel,

58:47.720 --> 58:48.960
Thanks, Francesca.

58:51.360 --> 58:54.250
I kinda wanted to talk to
you about my doggy mall.

58:54.800 --> 58:56.882
Remember when I first
started working here,

58:56.960 --> 58:59.122
I mentioned it and
you said you might."

58:59.800 --> 59:01.006
You know.”

59:01.400 --> 59:02.367
So,

59:02.440 --> 59:05.205
I was just thinking that now might
be a good time to invest and...

59:05.280 --> 59:06.406
Oh!

59:06.800 --> 59:08.131
I have to wee-wee,

59:12.080 --> 59:14.890
Sweetie, what'd I say'?
No phones in the office, Remember,

59:14.960 --> 59:17.008
Turn that off.
Don't answer it.

59:18.320 --> 59:21.483
Dude, where are you? Call me, call
me, call me, call me, call me!

59:23.320 --> 59:24.367
Ah!

59:24.440 --> 59:25.680
Hello?
Please stop,

59:25.760 --> 59:28.843
Hi. Yes, can we gel four grilled
cheese sandwiches please?

59:28.960 --> 59:30.564
What? No.
Wrong number. God!

59:30.640 --> 59:32.290
Stop! Stop laughing.

59:44.280 --> 59:45.611
Leave <i>a</i> message.

59:48.520 --> 59:51.251
Mom. Dad. It's me, Deena.

59:51.440 --> 59:52.441
Um...

59:52.840 --> 59:54.729
Long time no speak,

59:55.640 --> 59:57.688
Well, I just wanted
to let you know

59:57.760 --> 59:59.762
that your wayward
black sheep daughter

59:59.840 --> 01:00:02.161
has in fact sold a book,

01:00:02.720 --> 01:00:04.563
I'm sure you
won't read it, but...

01:00:05.360 --> 01:00:08.250
I just wanted to let you know
before someone else did. So.”

01:00:09.200 --> 01:00:10.361
That's it.

01:00:10.440 --> 01:00:11.771
Call me.

01:00:11.840 --> 01:00:12.841
Or not,

01:00:17.680 --> 01:00:18.761
Hey, Jayde,

01:00:18.840 --> 01:00:19.966
Hey, girl, hey,

01:00:20.040 --> 01:00:21.530
What are you
up to tonight?

01:00:21.600 --> 01:00:23.090
Whoa. It's like
we share the same brain.

01:00:23.160 --> 01:00:25.606
There's a party on Sunset,
a fashion show downtown

01:00:25.680 --> 01:00:27.728
and then an an
opening on La Cienega,

01:00:29.960 --> 01:00:32.361
All right, buddy,
okay. Sorry.

01:00:34.080 --> 01:00:36.242
Just wait one
second, buddy,

01:00:36.360 --> 01:00:38.727
Deena! Deena!

01:00:39.560 --> 01:00:41.005
Hello, are you here?

01:00:41.680 --> 01:00:43.170
Hey!
Hey.

01:00:43.240 --> 01:00:44.651
Whoa! What are you wearing'?

01:00:44.720 --> 01:00:46.165
Nocturnal car wash.
Sunset and Vine.

01:00:46.240 --> 01:00:47.730
Have you seen Deena?
No.

01:00:47.800 --> 01:00:49.689
Are you kidding me'?
Oh, my God!

01:00:49.760 --> 01:00:51.489
I can't believe how
much my life blows,

01:00:51.560 --> 01:00:53.005
Can you watch Max?

01:00:53.080 --> 01:00:54.730
I can't. I gotta
pay the rent.

01:00:54.800 --> 01:00:56.882
Sorry. I'm sure
Deena'll be back soon.

01:00:58.520 --> 01:00:59.567
Oh.”

01:01:02.240 --> 01:01:04.811
<i>Hi, you reached Deena
Gold, leave a message after the beep.</i>

01:01:09.040 --> 01:01:10.610
Oh! Hey, Billy.

01:01:10.920 --> 01:01:14.766
Hi. My mom told me to bring this over.
It got delivered to our place.

01:01:16.080 --> 01:01:17.809
Billy'?
Yeah?

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:19.604
How old are you?
Twelve.

01:01:20.280 --> 01:01:21.327
Do you wanna make 50 bucks'?

01:01:21.400 --> 01:01:22.401
Sure,

01:01:39.600 --> 01:01:40.806
Hi.

01:01:45.200 --> 01:01:46.201
Wow!

01:01:46.280 --> 01:01:48.681
Oh, my God.
I'm so overdressed,

01:01:48.760 --> 01:01:50.250
I thought we were
going to someplace nice.

01:01:50.320 --> 01:01:53.961
Hey. Come on, this place is nice.
I mean, it's not...

01:01:54.320 --> 01:01:57.563
It's not this nice, but
they got great onion rings.

01:01:57.640 --> 01:01:59.449
Really. Here, sit down.

01:02:02.800 --> 01:02:04.848
You look really pretty,

01:02:04.920 --> 01:02:05.967
Thank you,

01:02:06.040 --> 01:02:08.486
I'm sorry I was late,
I was...

01:02:11.160 --> 01:02:13.766
Well, I was taking
care of Max.

01:02:14.440 --> 01:02:16.647
Deena must be so grateful,

01:02:18.240 --> 01:02:19.480
Uh-huh,

01:02:20.960 --> 01:02:24.851
Listen, I kinda needed to talk
to you about the other night.

01:02:25.320 --> 01:02:28.961
No apology necessary.
I mean, you met my friends,

01:02:29.040 --> 01:02:31.805
Deena is nowhere near as
bad as those freaks, so...

01:02:32.640 --> 01:02:35.166
Right. It's not
really about that.

01:02:36.280 --> 01:02:37.850
Are you good?
ls everything okay?

01:02:40.840 --> 01:02:42.888
Hope you two
are hungry.

01:02:45.120 --> 01:02:46.929
Thank you!
You're welcome,

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:48.240
<i>Mmm-hmm.</i>

01:02:49.200 --> 01:02:50.406
Let me know if you
need anything else.

01:02:50.480 --> 01:02:51.606
Thank you,

01:02:52.800 --> 01:02:55.690
Sorry, I hope you don't mind, but I
ordered every appetizer on the menu.

01:02:55.760 --> 01:02:57.364
Surprised?

01:02:57.440 --> 01:02:58.521
I always do that!

01:02:59.080 --> 01:03:00.889
Come on,
nobody always does that.

01:03:00.960 --> 01:03:03.440
No, I really do. My friends
always make fun of me.

01:03:03.520 --> 01:03:04.806
They're so much
better than entrees.

01:03:05.040 --> 01:03:06.405
I know, right?
Smaller portions,

01:03:06.480 --> 01:03:07.811
More variety.

01:03:08.520 --> 01:03:10.363
Get out.
Cheese sticks,

01:03:15.120 --> 01:03:20.160
While you go ahead and finish
chewing that amazing cheese stick,

01:03:20.720 --> 01:03:24.042
I'm gonna throw coolness to
the wind and tell you that

01:03:26.320 --> 01:03:27.321
I like you,

01:03:29.040 --> 01:03:33.921
And I hope that doesn't freak you
out, but I just... I like you.

01:03:34.880 --> 01:03:36.245
And it would be great

01:03:36.320 --> 01:03:39.847
if you would say something
kind back to me right now,

01:03:40.920 --> 01:03:43.002
I'm sorry,
this is just so hot,

01:03:43.480 --> 01:03:44.845
I'm sorry.

01:03:45.440 --> 01:03:48.330
What I really wanted
to do was be an athlete

01:03:48.400 --> 01:03:51.927
but it turns out I can't run, I
can't jump and I can't catch.

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:53.764
So that kind of excluded me
from those things.

01:03:53.920 --> 01:03:58.164
So I took up my new calling,
which was musical theater,

01:03:58.240 --> 01:04:01.210
and I did a little thing called
The Pirates of Penzance.

01:04:01.280 --> 01:04:04.568
You may have heard of it. I might
have dominated it. Just saying.

01:04:05.080 --> 01:04:06.889
I'd like to see you
in some tights.

01:04:06.960 --> 01:04:08.724
You and my grandma, both,

01:04:10.920 --> 01:04:12.046
What about you?

01:04:12.160 --> 01:04:13.764
I wanna talk more
about you in tights,

01:04:14.280 --> 01:04:15.770
Not a chance,

01:04:23.040 --> 01:04:24.371
Sorry. It's Deena.

01:04:24.440 --> 01:04:25.771
If you gotta get it,
go ahead.

01:04:28.960 --> 01:04:30.325
No, you know what?
It's cool.

01:04:30.520 --> 01:04:31.726
It's probably nothing,

01:04:31.800 --> 01:04:34.280
Sometimes she forgets
that I have a life too, so...

01:04:35.280 --> 01:04:36.645
God, it must
be interesting.

01:04:37.440 --> 01:04:39.044
What do you mean?

01:04:39.120 --> 01:04:40.326
You know, just

01:04:41.600 --> 01:04:45.286
living with somebody so unestablished
who has a baby, that's all.

01:04:46.720 --> 01:04:50.327
So, by interesting,
do you mean awful?

01:04:50.400 --> 01:04:51.845
I just mean that

01:04:51.920 --> 01:04:53.365
you would think
that having a baby

01:04:53.440 --> 01:04:54.771
would force
someone to grow up.

01:04:54.840 --> 01:04:56.763
It just doesn't seem like
that's happened for Deena,

01:04:59.440 --> 01:05:01.841
You don't really
know anything about her,

01:05:02.120 --> 01:05:04.361
I'm not trying to
insult Deena at all.

01:05:04.720 --> 01:05:08.281
I mean, having <i>a</i> baby
and living with roommates,

01:05:08.360 --> 01:05:11.489
relying on them for
everything, that's horrid,

01:05:12.080 --> 01:05:15.084
All I'm saying is that I think
that you must be a saint

01:05:15.160 --> 01:05:18.164
for dealing
with somebody who

01:05:18.640 --> 01:05:21.166
so clearly
desperately needs it.

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:26.083
I just hope that Deena understands
that and realizes that

01:05:26.160 --> 01:05:27.525
she couldn't do
it without you-

01:05:32.160 --> 01:05:35.084
I'm sorry. Will you excuse me'?
I need to go to the restroom.

01:05:40.440 --> 01:05:44.001
What is he talking about? Relying
on people for everything.

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:48.288
Well, he's making
this very easy.

01:05:48.360 --> 01:05:52.968
There's no emotional attachment.
Just a little bone and bolt,

01:05:53.040 --> 01:05:57.204
A little nookie, a quick roll in the
hay, that's all this is anyway.

01:05:57.560 --> 01:05:59.130
Okay. Let's do this.

01:06:07.560 --> 01:06:08.686
Wail, wait, wait.

01:06:09.520 --> 01:06:12.410
I just want you to know, if you wanna
take this slow I'm okay with it.

01:06:13.560 --> 01:06:14.721
Yeah, it seems that way,

01:06:14.800 --> 01:06:15.881
Okay, let's get naked.

01:06:18.240 --> 01:06:19.810
Hey. Get outta here.

01:06:53.560 --> 01:06:54.766
You feel amazing,

01:06:54.840 --> 01:06:56.001
Really?

01:06:57.120 --> 01:07:01.045
Like normal amazing,
or just...

01:07:02.440 --> 01:07:03.930
Like amazing, amazing,

01:07:09.360 --> 01:07:10.441
Come here,

01:07:19.080 --> 01:07:21.447
Help, help. I'm so
bad at these things,

01:07:31.680 --> 01:07:32.681
Oh, God.

01:07:34.840 --> 01:07:35.887
What the.”

01:07:35.960 --> 01:07:37.849
It's not what you think.

01:07:38.160 --> 01:07:41.164
Well, what do I think?

01:07:41.320 --> 01:07:42.321
It happens,

01:07:42.480 --> 01:07:44.244
Breast milk just happens'?

01:07:44.960 --> 01:07:47.247
It's tribal, you know,
like, from living with Deena,

01:07:47.320 --> 01:07:48.651
You know how women
who live together

01:07:48.720 --> 01:07:50.051
get their periods
at the same time?

01:07:50.120 --> 01:07:51.724
No. I didn't know that.

01:07:51.800 --> 01:07:53.529
How do you not know that'?
You're a grown man!

01:07:54.520 --> 01:07:55.726
Sorry, but no!

01:07:55.840 --> 01:07:57.808
Well, it's like that.

01:07:57.880 --> 01:08:01.407
I get breast milk, and it
squirts when I get excited.

01:08:01.480 --> 01:08:02.970
It's a compliment, really.

01:08:11.440 --> 01:08:12.521
He's your baby?

01:08:18.319 --> 01:08:19.367
He's your baby,

01:08:26.720 --> 01:08:28.448
Well, the first hour
that I met you,

01:08:28.520 --> 01:08:30.170
you said that
kids were a buzzkill!

01:08:30.240 --> 01:08:31.287
No, I didn't.
Yes, you did,

01:08:31.359 --> 01:08:33.522
And then you were so judgmental
about the whole thing!

01:08:33.600 --> 01:08:36.080
Well, even if I did, I didn't
realize we were talking about you,

01:08:36.160 --> 01:08:37.685
Well, I didn't think
it mattered, okay?

01:08:37.800 --> 01:08:39.768
This wasn't
supposed to be serious,

01:08:41.279 --> 01:08:45.444
Right. Right. So, what was I?
Just some conquest?

01:08:45.520 --> 01:08:49.081
Just some random guy'? Oh,
what was it that Deena said?

01:08:49.760 --> 01:08:52.444
"Getting back into the game,
always a player at heart"?

01:08:52.520 --> 01:08:55.363
That's you, huh'?
Awesome.

01:09:02.040 --> 01:09:03.087
So.”

01:09:04.960 --> 01:09:07.645
You've never lied
about anything because

01:09:07.720 --> 01:09:10.326
you thought it made
things seem easier?

01:09:14.160 --> 01:09:15.207
<i>No,</i>

01:09:18.840 --> 01:09:22.925
Well, I guess you're a
better person than I am,

01:09:23.920 --> 01:09:25.160
Good-bye.

01:09:58.560 --> 01:10:02.281
What's going on?
Hello? Wait, sir! Sir!

01:10:02.640 --> 01:10:04.529
Wait! Sir, slop!

01:10:05.080 --> 01:10:06.445
Stop, stop.

01:10:06.600 --> 01:10:08.250
Wait, sir,
just a second. Stop!

01:10:11.960 --> 01:10:13.564
He's fine. He's sleeping,

01:10:15.120 --> 01:10:17.930
'Cause that neighbor kid you
hired kinda freaked out, Kim.

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:19.809
He'd never been
around a baby before.

01:10:19.960 --> 01:10:22.486
If I hadn't come home, they would
have called social services.

01:10:26.280 --> 01:10:29.284
Where the fuck were you tonight?
You were supposed to babysit!

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.970
What? Are you
out of your mind?

01:10:33.440 --> 01:10:37.843
There is nothing, there is absolutely
nothing that excuses your behavior,

01:10:37.960 --> 01:10:41.282
<i>So</i> I wasn't here, so you be here, Kim.
It's your child.

01:10:41.360 --> 01:10:43.647
How dare you!
How dare you judge me!

01:10:43.800 --> 01:10:45.290
You have no idea
what ifs like.

01:10:45.360 --> 01:10:49.684
If it had been me that night, if it had
been me who stole the last condom.“

01:10:51.240 --> 01:10:52.241
What'?

01:10:52.320 --> 01:10:53.321
This could have been you,

01:10:54.520 --> 01:10:55.885
Wow, Kim.

01:10:58.240 --> 01:10:59.321
Who are you?

01:11:09.680 --> 01:11:10.761
I don't know,

01:11:32.880 --> 01:11:33.961
Oh, my God!

01:11:34.040 --> 01:11:35.087
What?

01:11:37.040 --> 01:11:39.361
What are you listening to?
Is it that guy Henri?

01:11:44.040 --> 01:11:46.042
Give, give.
Let me listen.

01:11:47.040 --> 01:11:48.963
Oh, my God.

01:11:49.040 --> 01:11:51.407
This guy is crazy.
Listen to the voice mail.

01:11:53.720 --> 01:11:55.085
No!
I know,

01:11:55.840 --> 01:11:57.285
Wait, the end's gross,

01:11:57.360 --> 01:11:58.725
I thought that
was the best bit.

01:11:59.360 --> 01:12:00.566
Save it.
Totally.

01:12:00.640 --> 01:12:01.721
For sure,

01:12:02.800 --> 01:12:04.131
He's a freak,

01:12:17.880 --> 01:12:19.848
Hello'? Oh, my God,
there you are!

01:12:19.920 --> 01:12:22.287
I've been 911-ing you all day.
Where have you been?

01:12:22.400 --> 01:12:24.801
The customers are
starting to complain,

01:12:24.880 --> 01:12:28.089
Francesca, are you ever going
to invest in my doggy mall?

01:12:28.560 --> 01:12:31.006
Oh, God, the doggy mall,
the dog mall.

01:12:31.080 --> 01:12:32.570
All I hear about
is the stupid dog mall.

01:12:32.640 --> 01:12:35.211
Maybe I'd talk to you
about that dog mall

01:12:35.280 --> 01:12:37.726
if you actually did
your job once in a while.

01:12:37.800 --> 01:12:42.283
You know what, Francesca? I am so sick
of letting you treat me like shit.

01:12:42.360 --> 01:12:44.567
Consider this my
five minutes' notice,

01:12:44.640 --> 01:12:47.530
You... But you
can't just quit.

01:12:47.600 --> 01:12:50.365
And you know what else?
You're not 21-year-old hot,

01:12:53.920 --> 01:12:55.445
That's very rude,

01:12:56.080 --> 01:12:57.286
Good-bye.

01:13:44.280 --> 01:13:48.046
Hi. I brought you some
magazines and sandwiches.

01:13:48.120 --> 01:13:50.361
Godmothers, extra
spicy with the works,

01:13:56.880 --> 01:13:59.565
Are you gonna emerge from
the darkness anytime soon?

01:14:00.520 --> 01:14:02.522
Is Deena here?
No.

01:14:03.440 --> 01:14:04.771
She's avoiding me?

01:14:06.600 --> 01:14:07.761
Yeah,

01:14:10.240 --> 01:14:12.527
My best friend thinks
I'm a despicable person,

01:14:12.600 --> 01:14:14.967
I lost the first guy who's
liked me in a really long time

01:14:15.040 --> 01:14:16.565
and I'm the worst mom ever,

01:14:18.520 --> 01:14:20.249
When I get <i>sad,</i>

01:14:20.320 --> 01:14:23.688
I like to think of good things
that are unrelated to my problems.

01:14:23.760 --> 01:14:27.401
Like whales, or those little yellow
chickens from Easter, puffs.

01:14:27.480 --> 01:14:28.720
Those are called Peeps.

01:14:29.200 --> 01:14:30.929
Laura, I know you're
just trying to help,

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:32.650
but can you please
just leave us alone?

01:14:40.560 --> 01:14:41.561
Kim.

01:14:44.120 --> 01:14:45.804
I don't mean to sound harsh,

01:14:45.880 --> 01:14:47.325
but you're kind of
just lying around

01:14:47.400 --> 01:14:48.811
like you're giving up
on life or something.

01:14:49.880 --> 01:14:51.564
That's easy
for you to say!

01:14:51.640 --> 01:14:54.530
Why? Because my life
is so perfect?

01:14:55.400 --> 01:14:58.131
I have no skills,
except that I'm pretty,

01:14:58.360 --> 01:14:59.930
People think I'm dumb,

01:15:00.320 --> 01:15:01.890
I live in a world
where I'm considered

01:15:01.960 --> 01:15:03.803
a weirdo
because of my beliefs,

01:15:05.240 --> 01:15:08.961
I'm not saying that my problems
are as serious as yours.

01:15:09.040 --> 01:15:11.486
I mean, heck no.

01:15:11.600 --> 01:15:13.329
But everything's relative,

01:15:15.120 --> 01:15:17.885
You need to be
happy for Max.

01:15:31.200 --> 01:15:32.531
Can I help you?

01:15:32.600 --> 01:15:34.204
Hey, beauty. I heard,

01:15:34.280 --> 01:15:37.443
What do you say we go out and get
into some old-school trouble?

01:15:38.320 --> 01:15:40.527
I'm just really focused
on my career right now,

01:15:40.640 --> 01:15:42.290
Yeah. So am I,

01:15:42.920 --> 01:15:46.891
But I wake up every morning with a
raging boner with your name on it.

01:15:46.960 --> 01:15:49.645
Come on, let me be your
"man with dishpan hands."

01:15:51.280 --> 01:15:53.248
How did you...
I googled you,

01:16:07.480 --> 01:16:09.130
Oh, my God, it's you!

01:16:09.960 --> 01:16:11.405
Rita, the receptionist!

01:16:11.640 --> 01:16:14.644
I'm marrying my skydiving instructor,
and it's all because of you!

01:16:15.720 --> 01:16:16.960
Congratulations.

01:16:17.040 --> 01:16:18.246
Thank you!

01:16:31.520 --> 01:16:33.329
What do you think, buddy'?

01:16:34.840 --> 01:16:36.649
Hey!
Hey.

01:16:36.720 --> 01:16:37.801
You made it!

01:16:49.040 --> 01:16:50.371
You are late,

01:16:50.440 --> 01:16:51.680
I had to stop for these,

01:16:52.680 --> 01:16:54.011
I don't believe in flowers,

01:16:54.080 --> 01:16:56.321
I think they're a trite symbol
developed to keep women needy.

01:17:00.600 --> 01:17:02.443
I only agreed to
let you meet me here

01:17:02.520 --> 01:17:04.284
so you would
stop pestering me,

01:17:07.120 --> 01:17:08.406
Yeah, I know.

01:17:08.480 --> 01:17:09.720
You're aware of
the conditions?

01:17:09.800 --> 01:17:12.167
No talking. No touching.
No disturbing my workflow,

01:17:12.560 --> 01:17:13.971
What if I violate
those terms?

01:17:14.040 --> 01:17:15.485
I said, no talking.

01:17:15.560 --> 01:17:17.562
Are you looking
to be punished?

01:17:19.400 --> 01:17:21.050
I promise to
leave you alone,

01:17:22.400 --> 01:17:25.643
If you agree to stop by
American Apparel afterwards

01:17:25.720 --> 01:17:27.484
and try on
a few things for me,

01:17:27.560 --> 01:17:29.244
You are such <i>a</i> perv,

01:17:32.720 --> 01:17:33.801
Deal.

01:17:38.560 --> 01:17:42.246
I didn't know a place like this existed.
This place is awesome.

01:17:42.320 --> 01:17:45.324
The second JJJ gels in here,
she completely falls asleep.

01:17:45.400 --> 01:17:48.404
I get to relax,
I can do my drawing...

01:17:48.480 --> 01:17:49.766
Oh, wow, you draw?

01:17:49.840 --> 01:17:51.001
You seem shocked,

01:17:51.080 --> 01:17:52.411
Are you propagating the myth

01:17:52.520 --> 01:17:54.966
that stay-at-home moms have to
give up all their passions?

01:17:55.440 --> 01:17:56.487
I'm sorry.

01:17:56.640 --> 01:17:57.721
It's okay,

01:17:57.800 --> 01:18:00.167
I actually am writing
a children's book,

01:18:00.240 --> 01:18:02.641
it's called "Tickle,
Tickle Little Pickle)'

01:18:03.840 --> 01:18:05.001
My husband Brock
says it's gonna be

01:18:05.080 --> 01:18:06.286
the laughing stock
of the Internet,

01:18:06.360 --> 01:18:07.361
but, you know what,
I like it.

01:18:07.440 --> 01:18:09.249
I can show it to you if you want.
You don't have to.

01:18:09.320 --> 01:18:11.049
Yeah, I'd love to see it.
Are you sure?

01:18:11.120 --> 01:18:12.451
Yeah.
Okay,

01:18:12.880 --> 01:18:14.166
Okay, so that's it.

01:18:14.280 --> 01:18:19.047
Yeah. The pickle looks <i>a</i> little
demented now, but it's a prototype.

01:18:19.120 --> 01:18:22.522
I'm thinking on taking down
the squirrel things,

01:18:22.600 --> 01:18:24.045
because right now
it looks like

01:18:24.120 --> 01:18:26.202
it's actually trying
to kill the pickle.

01:18:26.280 --> 01:18:28.647
Wow. This is a pretty rock
and roll little kids' book.

01:18:28.720 --> 01:18:30.290
I think there's
something there,

01:18:30.360 --> 01:18:31.486
What do you think, buddy'?

01:19:13.040 --> 01:19:17.045
Oh, God! Keep doing...
Oh, keep doing that!

01:19:17.120 --> 01:19:18.724
<i>Oh, don't Slop that! Oh!</i>

01:19:20.480 --> 01:19:21.481
Oh, God!

01:19:23.960 --> 01:19:26.486
<i>Pussy master!
Pussy master, yes!</i>

01:19:27.160 --> 01:19:29.766
<i>Oh, yes, pussy master!</i>

01:19:31.280 --> 01:19:36.127
<i>Oh, pussy master! Yes! Oh,
yes, you're a pussy master!</i>

01:19:40.040 --> 01:19:41.371
(MAX CRYING}

01:19:46.680 --> 01:19:50.810
To speak or act in
an evasive way, 11 letters,

01:19:52.760 --> 01:19:54.091
Prevaricate,

01:20:01.200 --> 01:20:03.965
Well, hello there.
How'd you sleep?

01:20:04.400 --> 01:20:06.323
Horrible. I just now
got Max to sleep.

01:20:06.400 --> 01:20:08.687
How did you sleep,
pussy master'?

01:20:11.960 --> 01:20:15.169
Kim. Nicholas
asked about you,

01:20:15.240 --> 01:20:18.403
I think he'd like
to hear from you,

01:20:19.080 --> 01:20:20.570
Great.
Tell him I said hi,

01:20:20.640 --> 01:20:22.244
You don't have to be
so hard on yourself, Kim.

01:20:22.320 --> 01:20:24.368
You know you made <i>a</i> mistake,
you're human, big whoop.

01:20:24.440 --> 01:20:25.521
So is he,

01:20:26.920 --> 01:20:30.402
Oh, my gosh! I've been
chosen for a reality show!

01:20:30.480 --> 01:20:31.845
I get to live in a mansion!

01:20:33.080 --> 01:20:34.844
<i>What?
Yeah. America's Last Virgin!</i>

01:20:34.920 --> 01:20:37.400
I found out about it, and I
sent my picture in and I'm in!

01:20:37.760 --> 01:20:39.649
Wail. What show'?

01:20:39.720 --> 01:20:41.006
<i>America's Last Virgin.</i>

01:20:41.520 --> 01:20:45.081
They find 20 virgins,
all over the age of 21.

01:20:45.440 --> 01:20:46.885
And they have us
live in a house

01:20:46.960 --> 01:20:48.769
where there's
porn playing 24!?

01:20:48.840 --> 01:20:50.524
And you share
a room with a male model,

01:20:50.600 --> 01:20:52.204
And then,
you go out on dates

01:20:52.280 --> 01:20:54.487
and the dates, they try to tempt
you into losing your virginity.

01:20:54.680 --> 01:20:57.843
And the last virgin
standing wins $100,000!

01:20:58.400 --> 01:20:59.606
It's perfect, right?

01:20:59.680 --> 01:21:02.365
Deena, I figured you're always
saying take things as they come,

01:21:02.440 --> 01:21:04.522
It's like that chapter in your
book, "Grab Life By The Balls."

01:21:04.760 --> 01:21:05.727
<i>So</i> I totally
grabbed my balls,

01:21:05.800 --> 01:21:08.041
I mean, I thought it was gross,
but I get it now. You get it.

01:21:08.440 --> 01:21:10.602
I knew I was saving myself
for something this special!

01:21:11.600 --> 01:21:13.045
Oh!

01:21:19.200 --> 01:21:21.567
That sounds like
a recipe for rape,

01:21:21.640 --> 01:21:24.291
Did she just make it sound like
I inspired her to do that?

01:21:26.120 --> 01:21:28.600
Hey, Deena, can I talk to
you for a minute, outside?

01:21:31.040 --> 01:21:32.041
Alone?

01:21:33.120 --> 01:21:34.121
Yeah,

01:21:42.880 --> 01:21:44.609
Pussy master!

01:21:54.120 --> 01:21:55.724
I'm gonna move out,

01:22:01.040 --> 01:22:03.088
Wow. Okay.

01:22:04.320 --> 01:22:06.049
I'm gonna pay you
the next month's rent,

01:22:06.120 --> 01:22:07.281
so that will
give you enough time

01:22:07.400 --> 01:22:09.050
to figure out
what you wanna do,

01:22:11.680 --> 01:22:12.841
Uh...

01:22:13.520 --> 01:22:17.684
Is this like about last night?
Because we were loud“.

01:22:18.840 --> 01:22:22.925
I know things have been
awkward between us”.

01:22:23.040 --> 01:22:24.610
It's not that.

01:22:27.040 --> 01:22:29.042
You and I had this plan

01:22:30.760 --> 01:22:34.207
to be fabulous and
conquer the world.

01:22:34.280 --> 01:22:36.681
And I'm sorry that
I relied on you...

01:22:36.760 --> 01:22:38.046
Kim, you don't
have to feel...

01:22:38.120 --> 01:22:40.361
Please, just
let me finish.

01:22:45.720 --> 01:22:51.045
I think that the really scary
part has been realizing that

01:22:53.360 --> 01:22:56.204
maybe I don'! need
to conquer the world,

01:22:56.880 --> 01:22:58.723
Maybe I'm okay
with hanging out

01:22:58.800 --> 01:23:01.167
with the lame moms
at Café Chez Bébé,

01:23:01.240 --> 01:23:03.208
Maybe I'm more
than okay with it.

01:23:03.280 --> 01:23:04.725
Maybe I like it.

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:09.570
So what are you gonna do?

01:23:09.920 --> 01:23:10.967
Doggy mall?

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:15.402
Yeah, I'm starting to
think that whole idea was

01:23:15.920 --> 01:23:19.641
childish and unsanitary
and maybe even unsafe.

01:23:19.720 --> 01:23:21.210
I honestly don't know,

01:23:24.080 --> 01:23:29.007
Deena, I'm so happy for you and
your success, and I adore you.

01:23:30.920 --> 01:23:32.649
I adore you,

01:23:35.280 --> 01:23:39.604
But you have to focus on your
career now, and I need. <i>4,</i>

01:23:40.160 --> 01:23:41.764
I need to focus
on being a mom.

01:23:44.200 --> 01:23:47.363
And I just worry that
if I don't move out now...

01:23:47.440 --> 01:23:49.090
That we might
not stay friends,

01:24:41.960 --> 01:24:44.406
So, it's a one bedroom,
one bath,

01:24:44.480 --> 01:24:45.891
but there's a nice
little nook over here

01:24:45.960 --> 01:24:47.325
that would be
great for a nursery,

01:24:47.920 --> 01:24:49.410
Wanna see it?

01:24:49.520 --> 01:24:50.601
We'll take it.

01:24:51.760 --> 01:24:53.444
Do you wanna discuss it
with your husband?

01:24:54.160 --> 01:24:56.447
Nope- It's just us.

01:24:57.160 --> 01:24:58.366
All right, then,

01:24:58.440 --> 01:25:01.603
Let me show you the backyard,
There's <i>a</i> sandbox and a swing set.“

01:25:01.680 --> 01:25:03.603
Did you hear that, buddy'?
There's a sandbox!

01:25:42.960 --> 01:25:46.169
He's getting so heavy.
You're getting so heavy,

01:25:50.640 --> 01:25:51.880
Is that your truck'?

01:25:53.480 --> 01:25:56.165
Max, can you say "truck"?
Truck?

01:25:58.240 --> 01:25:59.366
That's a bunny,

01:26:00.840 --> 01:26:03.161
Kisses, Kisses for you,

01:26:12.520 --> 01:26:16.320
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
You sweet little thing,

01:26:16.440 --> 01:26:18.841
you were just walking!

01:26:19.360 --> 01:26:23.001
Oh, my God, you sweet little monkey!
I'm so proud of you!

01:26:23.440 --> 01:26:26.887
Oh, my God! My baby.

01:26:35.280 --> 01:26:39.205
Henri! Henri, Henri! It came!
Oh, my God!

01:26:39.280 --> 01:26:40.930
Oh, my God! It came!

01:26:43.880 --> 01:26:46.690
Baby, maybe we should
get a joint bank account.

01:26:46.760 --> 01:26:49.161
Oh, man, I grew up
in a trailer-

01:26:49.800 --> 01:26:51.370
They pay a lot of money
for self-help books.

01:26:51.440 --> 01:26:53.886
It's not a self-help book, punk.
It's a sociological study.

01:26:53.960 --> 01:26:57.123
Oh, it's a sociological
study. You're rich.

01:26:57.200 --> 01:26:59.885
Oh, my gosh, that's hot.
You're so rich'

01:27:00.720 --> 01:27:01.721
I love that.

01:27:02.960 --> 01:27:04.962
I've never had sex
with a rich woman before.

01:27:05.520 --> 01:27:08.683
Outside, anyway... Never had sex...
And sober.

01:27:11.120 --> 01:27:12.565
Whoa, whoa!

01:27:12.640 --> 01:27:14.085
Okay, just one finger.

01:27:18.800 --> 01:27:21.326
You eat it.
You eat it. I'm good.

01:27:27.840 --> 01:27:30.320
I'm sorry for being late,
I'm so, so sorry.

01:27:33.600 --> 01:27:36.171
How's the little dude'?
How are you?

01:27:36.240 --> 01:27:38.083
So, let me guess, you
didn't get your contract

01:27:38.160 --> 01:27:41.004
and now you think you can just
waltz back into our lives?

01:27:41.080 --> 01:27:43.924
No, that's not it.
I read this

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:46.924
rad book when I was on tour
called Pregnancy and Beyond.

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:48.286
Uh-huh,

01:27:48.360 --> 01:27:50.203
Read the whole thing,
cover to cover.

01:27:50.680 --> 01:27:54.765
It had gnarly stuff about smegma,
I almost stopped reading it.

01:27:54.840 --> 01:27:57.525
Then I kept reading it,
and it started to talk about

01:27:57.600 --> 01:28:00.763
how they start to develop these,
like, sick personalities,

01:28:00.840 --> 01:28:03.889
And it made me wanna, like, not
miss out on all that good stuff.

01:28:08.720 --> 01:28:12.964
And the truth is, I nearly lost
my abdomen in a shark attack.

01:28:13.440 --> 01:28:14.965
There's nothing
like a brush with death

01:28:15.040 --> 01:28:19.045
to make you realize what the
important things in life are.

01:28:19.120 --> 01:28:20.360
And I wanna see my kid,

01:28:21.400 --> 01:28:22.447
Okay?

01:28:25.040 --> 01:28:27.042
I'm not gonna go
through this again, Marc.

01:28:27.480 --> 01:28:31.485
I want another shot at being a dad.
Can you understand that?

01:28:33.360 --> 01:28:34.691
I think I'd be a good dad.

01:28:45.400 --> 01:28:47.721
Come here.
Come here, little buddy,

01:28:50.480 --> 01:28:52.926
You gonna be <i>a</i> little
hell raiser, aren't you?

01:28:53.280 --> 01:28:56.443
You gonna be a little hell raiser?
A little outlaw?

01:28:56.920 --> 01:28:58.331
A little bandit?

01:28:58.960 --> 01:29:00.291
He's a good boy,

01:29:02.080 --> 01:29:03.161
What's that'?

01:29:04.160 --> 01:29:05.161
Bad boy?

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:08.001
Bad!

01:29:08.760 --> 01:29:09.761
<i>Okay.</i>

01:29:35.280 --> 01:29:37.282
Hey!
Hey!

01:29:39.440 --> 01:29:41.124
How are you?
Good. Good.

01:29:41.200 --> 01:29:42.964
How are you?
Good.

01:29:44.040 --> 01:29:46.247
Where's Max?
Is he in college yet?

01:29:46.480 --> 01:29:49.211
Actually, he's with Marc.

01:29:49.800 --> 01:29:51.802
Really?
Yep,

01:29:52.080 --> 01:29:54.765
He came crawling back, and now he
lakes him whenever I go to work.

01:29:54.880 --> 01:29:55.881
Wow.

01:29:55.960 --> 01:29:56.961
Yeah,

01:29:59.680 --> 01:30:01.364
I gotta tell you,

01:30:02.080 --> 01:30:04.128
I miss seeing Max every day,

01:30:05.240 --> 01:30:06.924
And you.
Yeah. Me too,

01:30:09.720 --> 01:30:11.085
So.”

01:30:12.640 --> 01:30:14.290
My dad called me,

01:30:14.360 --> 01:30:17.011
That's great, Deena, I bet
that feels really good.

01:30:17.080 --> 01:30:18.127
Yeah,

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:22.604
What are we doing'?

01:30:23.760 --> 01:30:25.091
I miss you.
I miss you!

01:30:25.600 --> 01:30:27.523
I've got so much to tell you.
Come in, come in.

01:30:30.840 --> 01:30:32.126
What'?

01:30:32.200 --> 01:30:34.168
Oh, my God!

01:30:34.840 --> 01:30:36.444
Dude, the place
looks outta sight!

01:30:36.520 --> 01:30:38.124
It's Henri, man,
He's all over it.

01:30:40.320 --> 01:30:41.606
You bought
the massage chair!

01:30:41.680 --> 01:30:43.489
I love that thing.
I wanna be buried with it.

01:30:45.760 --> 01:30:47.489
This is awesome!

01:30:48.200 --> 01:30:49.770
Whatever happened
to waiting at least

01:30:49.880 --> 01:30:51.450
two years before
moving in with a guy?

01:30:51.800 --> 01:30:54.883
Well, the rules are,
there are no rules.

01:30:54.960 --> 01:30:56.530
When multiple orgasms
are involved.

01:30:56.600 --> 01:30:58.523
Shut up! I thought
those were a myth!

01:30:58.640 --> 01:31:01.371
So did I, dude.
So did I.

01:31:02.040 --> 01:31:04.805
Well, I e-mailed Nicholas.

01:31:04.880 --> 01:31:06.723
And?
And nothing,

01:31:06.800 --> 01:31:08.643
I mean, I wasn't
expecting a response

01:31:08.720 --> 01:31:10.563
after the crap
that I pulled, but

01:31:10.640 --> 01:31:12.130
I just wanted
to clear the air,

01:31:12.200 --> 01:31:13.201
Good,

01:31:15.640 --> 01:31:17.369
So, listen.

01:31:17.440 --> 01:31:19.044
I got a huge advance
check for my book.

01:31:19.400 --> 01:31:21.289
Wow, dude,
you are killing it!

01:31:21.360 --> 01:31:22.486
And I want to
invest a portion of it.

01:31:22.560 --> 01:31:23.686
Okay.

01:31:24.560 --> 01:31:26.483
See, I've been
working on this project

01:31:26.560 --> 01:31:28.722
that I want to piggyback
off the book release.

01:31:29.240 --> 01:31:31.686
I need you to
partner with me, 50-50,

01:31:37.640 --> 01:31:40.564
It feels great.
But I'm not surprised at all.

01:31:40.680 --> 01:31:42.682
I knew I'd make it
past round four.

01:31:42.760 --> 01:31:44.410
I was born to win this,

01:31:44.480 --> 01:31:46.562
The golden crotch
remains intact!

01:31:48.080 --> 01:31:51.004
Oh, my gosh! You guys, I can'!
be late. We have to go.

01:31:51.640 --> 01:31:52.926
Come on. Come on!

01:31:59.840 --> 01:32:01.365
Hi, look at you!

01:32:01.600 --> 01:32:06.208
Take your hand? Let's go. Let's go!
Come on. Baby, let's go,

01:32:06.920 --> 01:32:08.046
It's so much fun,

01:32:08.120 --> 01:32:09.201
I know,

01:32:09.280 --> 01:32:10.327
Ready, one, two.”

01:32:10.400 --> 01:32:11.447
Ready?

01:32:14.360 --> 01:32:15.725
Hey! We made it.

01:32:15.840 --> 01:32:17.171
Hey.

01:32:27.600 --> 01:32:29.364
<i>Thanks for coming,
everybody.</i>

01:32:29.480 --> 01:32:31.369
<i>Kim, front and center.</i>

01:32:31.480 --> 01:32:32.811
<i>Patti, thanks for coming.</i>

01:32:33.480 --> 01:32:35.960
<i>Jayde, get your
weights up. Great.</i>

01:32:36.200 --> 01:32:39.488
<i>Here we go, guys. We're gonna
start with a lift and touch.</i>

01:32:40.400 --> 01:32:42.084
<i>Lift and touch.</i>

01:32:42.560 --> 01:32:45.723
<i>Get those arms tight.
Get those loose knees.</i>

01:32:46.680 --> 01:32:47.886
<i>Henri, out of here!</i>

01:32:49.480 --> 01:32:51.642
<i>Lift up and down.</i>

01:32:54.320 --> 01:32:55.560
<i>There we go. Looking good.</i>

01:33:09.360 --> 01:33:11.966
Oh, my God!

01:33:12.080 --> 01:33:14.606
We look like such tools.
I love it!

01:33:14.680 --> 01:33:18.127
I know, I can't believe we're gonna
be on demand, dude, it's so good.

01:33:18.200 --> 01:33:20.965
Who knew we'd be able to capitalize
on me getting knocked up?

01:33:21.040 --> 01:33:22.121
Babe, you here?

01:33:22.240 --> 01:33:23.287
YEP

01:33:23.360 --> 01:33:25.488
Nicholas and I
got burritos.

01:33:25.560 --> 01:33:27.608
We're gonna shoot a little pool.
Is that cool?

01:33:27.680 --> 01:33:28.966
Cool. Yep.

01:33:29.520 --> 01:33:30.521
What? Nicholas is here?

01:33:30.600 --> 01:33:31.601
Kim.

01:33:31.680 --> 01:33:34.286
What am I gonna do'?
I'm gonna hide.

01:33:34.360 --> 01:33:36.283
Kim. I can'! hide. Max is here!
Oh, my God!

01:33:36.360 --> 01:33:37.361
Kim! Kim.

01:33:37.440 --> 01:33:38.885
Oh, Jesus, how do I look'?

01:33:39.840 --> 01:33:40.921
You look beautiful,

01:33:41.520 --> 01:33:43.045
It's gonna be okay.
Okay,

01:33:44.280 --> 01:33:45.281
Hey. Oh!

01:33:45.640 --> 01:33:46.641
Hey.

01:33:51.640 --> 01:33:52.641
Hi.

01:33:55.760 --> 01:33:57.364
Hen?
What?

01:33:57.560 --> 01:34:00.484
Do you wanna go in
the other room and

01:34:00.560 --> 01:34:01.607
feel me up'?

01:34:02.560 --> 01:34:04.244
Yeah, I do.
Okay.

01:34:07.640 --> 01:34:09.483
Bye, Deena,
Don't feel her up.

01:34:21.760 --> 01:34:23.649
I got your e-mail...
Yeah.

01:34:23.760 --> 01:34:26.161
And I don't think
that you are a...

01:34:27.160 --> 01:34:31.688
"A flaming piece of shit," or
"A pox on the face of dignity."

01:34:31.760 --> 01:34:32.761
You don't?

01:34:32.880 --> 01:34:38.171
I understand why someone might
not tell someone something,

01:34:38.240 --> 01:34:40.766
because they are afraid of
the way they might react.

01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:47.924
All right. This is hard,

01:34:49.320 --> 01:34:50.685
I11

01:34:51.320 --> 01:34:52.321
married.

01:34:53.480 --> 01:34:54.527
Oh!

01:34:54.600 --> 01:34:56.489
No, technically,
I'm separated.

01:34:57.120 --> 01:34:58.770
She moved out
before you and I met.

01:34:59.440 --> 01:35:03.126
Actually, I'm four days away
from being legally divorced.

01:35:04.960 --> 01:35:06.610
But this year
was rough for me,

01:35:09.200 --> 01:35:11.123
And I met you, and

01:35:12.800 --> 01:35:14.131
you just made it better

01:35:14.200 --> 01:35:18.410
and I didn't want to do anything
to screw that up. And...

01:35:21.680 --> 01:35:22.966
I should have told you,

01:35:24.960 --> 01:35:26.803
So, then,
we're both liars.

01:35:26.880 --> 01:35:29.042
But, for the record,
you were first.

01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:31.570
Well, that's
a great foundation

01:35:31.640 --> 01:35:33.642
for a relationship,
don't you think?

01:35:33.720 --> 01:35:36.041
Not that I'm suggesting that
we would have a relationship,

01:35:36.120 --> 01:35:39.283
I was just making a statement,
like an observation that doesn't

01:35:41.400 --> 01:35:42.731
Aw...

01:35:42.840 --> 01:35:44.604
My ovaries just
skipped a beat,

01:35:45.360 --> 01:35:46.850
Mine too,

01:35:51.320 --> 01:35:53.163
Let's shoot
some sticks, yo!

01:35:53.880 --> 01:35:55.291
Bros vs. hoes,

01:35:55.360 --> 01:35:56.600
You ready for this?

01:35:56.680 --> 01:35:59.843
Ladies, you should know that
we are pretty good at this,

01:35:59.920 --> 01:36:01.001
Oh, you have no idea.

01:36:01.120 --> 01:36:02.281
That's a big check, mister,

01:36:02.400 --> 01:36:03.526
No! big at all.

01:36:06.160 --> 01:36:08.003
Come on. Come to Deena,

01:36:13.360 --> 01:36:14.521
Hey, don't put it
on the table!

01:36:14.600 --> 01:36:15.761
What'?

01:36:15.840 --> 01:36:17.080
Oh, I'm sorry,
you're not <i>a</i> baby,

01:36:17.160 --> 01:36:20.687
You're like <i>a</i> person, You're
like a real person now.

01:36:20.760 --> 01:36:21.921
All rig ht. Okay.

01:36:24.680 --> 01:36:26.523
Let's do this,
Sorry, Max.

01:36:26.600 --> 01:36:29.570
I rack 'em really,
really tight.

01:36:30.080 --> 01:36:31.127
Break it.

01:36:31.200 --> 01:36:33.168
All right, you got
a mean mommy here,

01:36:36.280 --> 01:36:37.361
Ready? Go on,
Kim, break.

01:36:37.440 --> 01:36:38.566
Okay, I'll break.

01:36:40.560 --> 01:36:43.291
Yeah, you can. Come on. You can do it.
You can do it. You can do it.

01:36:44.880 --> 01:36:48.327
Lost again!
So did we lose?
