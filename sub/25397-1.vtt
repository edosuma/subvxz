00:23.885 --> 00:26.060
So here I am, big night.

00:29.201 --> 00:33.136
It's the red carpet premier
for my documentary.

00:34.965 --> 00:38.635
Today alone I've
gotten calls from jj,

00:38.659 --> 00:40.695
Steven, Harvey,

00:43.146 --> 00:46.425
not to mention every
big agent in town.

00:48.117 --> 00:49.853
A month ago they treated
me like dog shit

00:49.877 --> 00:52.097
on the bottom of their
expensive Italian loafers.

00:52.121 --> 00:54.754
Now, they wanna know
what I'm doing next,

00:54.778 --> 00:56.642
who I'm in talks with.

00:58.265 --> 01:02.476
They're all trying to sell me
on what they can do for me.

01:05.479 --> 01:06.756
I made my deal.

01:09.483 --> 01:11.174
I did the hard work.

01:12.555 --> 01:16.076
I mean, how else do
they think I got here?

01:18.319 --> 01:19.424
So, fuck 'em.

01:25.050 --> 01:29.192
This isn't exactly how I
pictured things happening,

01:29.986 --> 01:34.094
but you take the hand that
life deals you, right?

01:35.474 --> 01:36.900
You fake it till you make it.

01:36.924 --> 01:38.443
Die while you try.

01:44.794 --> 01:47.452
I mean, look at me,
I'm still filming.

01:48.970 --> 01:50.731
Movie's over, man.

01:51.214 --> 01:52.422
Move on.

01:57.393 --> 02:00.292
Move on, you piece of shit.

02:17.723 --> 02:19.760
- Here you go sir.

02:22.280 --> 02:23.660
Good size crowd.

02:37.605 --> 02:38.686
Hello.

02:38.710 --> 02:39.928
Hello and welcome.

02:39.952 --> 02:42.379
Welcome everyone to the
premier of the movie

02:42.403 --> 02:44.692
that has not only taken
Hollywood by storm,

02:44.716 --> 02:48.385
but the entire world,
darkness reigns.

02:50.722 --> 02:52.424
I'm excited too.

02:52.448 --> 02:54.736
Now, we are so lucky

02:54.760 --> 02:57.118
to have the filmmaker
here with us tonight

02:57.142 --> 02:58.913
to introduce the film.

02:58.937 --> 03:02.572
So, please join me in
welcoming, Daniel Whitaker.

03:11.950 --> 03:16.161
Hello everyone, thank you for
coming to see the movie.

03:18.577 --> 03:21.591
Been an odd journey really.

03:21.615 --> 03:23.765
As I'm sure you're aware,

03:23.789 --> 03:27.103
a lot of crazy things happened
that I was able to capture.

03:28.242 --> 03:30.002
P-, people were hurt,

03:32.971 --> 03:34.421
uh, killed,

03:36.112 --> 03:38.987
but I survived to tell the
story of what happened

03:39.011 --> 03:42.049
on that movie set
nearly a year ago.

03:44.672 --> 03:47.479
You're gonna see
most of the crazy

03:47.503 --> 03:50.816
and the unexplainable
things that happened.

03:52.128 --> 03:54.475
Most but not all.

03:57.340 --> 04:00.688
Some things are just a
little too gruesome to show,

04:01.551 --> 04:03.943
and well, some of the
family wouldn't cooperate,

04:03.967 --> 04:06.291
but, uh, I completely
understand it,

04:06.315 --> 04:09.490
and think you will
once you see the film.

04:14.081 --> 04:16.980
Some things just don't
need to be seen,

04:20.673 --> 04:24.850
but I shot a lot and I c-captured
a lot of crazy things.

04:28.233 --> 04:31.132
Uh, before we show the film,

04:31.443 --> 04:32.883
I'm supposed to tell
you a little bit

04:32.907 --> 04:34.978
about how this all came about.

04:40.590 --> 04:42.050
- I'm rolling, Aaron.

04:42.074 --> 04:43.707
Cool, cool, just spray the room.

04:43.731 --> 04:45.571
You know, get some b roll,
whatever looks good.

04:45.595 --> 04:47.597
- I know, I got it.

04:47.908 --> 04:49.634
And what's this?

04:50.255 --> 04:53.027
Oh, this is part of our
cast of our movie.

04:53.051 --> 04:55.332
- S-, s-, say the name of
the movie when you can.

04:55.356 --> 04:56.099
Oh yeah, right.

04:56.123 --> 04:59.229
This is part of the
cast of defanatus soul.

04:59.713 --> 05:01.794
- And who's she?

05:01.818 --> 05:04.487
- Oh, this is Rebecca Logan.

05:04.511 --> 05:07.662
You might have seen
her in, uh, uh,

05:07.686 --> 05:09.388
dark midnight or, um...

05:09.412 --> 05:11.148
The wiccan altar. Yes.

05:11.172 --> 05:14.255
We just closed the deal
on Casper Van dien.

05:14.279 --> 05:15.946
This is huge people,
we got our name.

05:18.490 --> 05:21.504
This is the director of
defanatus soul, Jacob bale.

05:21.528 --> 05:22.712
Hey, uh, do you mind
if we shoot with you

05:22.736 --> 05:23.609
for a little bit?
Yeah, that's fine.

05:23.633 --> 05:25.335
Alright, I'm just gonna ask you

05:25.359 --> 05:28.165
some questions off camera, if
you just wanna play to me.

05:28.189 --> 05:29.201
Go for it.

05:29.225 --> 05:30.945
- You got your focus
and everything?

05:30.969 --> 05:31.237
Cool.

05:31.261 --> 05:32.929
So, you got your cast,
how's that feel?

05:32.953 --> 05:34.931
Yeah, we just locked
in Casper Van dien

05:34.955 --> 05:36.450
from, uh, starship troopers,

05:36.474 --> 05:38.348
sleepy hollow, yada, yada, yada.

05:38.372 --> 05:40.557
I mean, he's, he's
an awesome get.

05:40.581 --> 05:41.861
When you do these
kinds of films,

05:41.885 --> 05:43.905
the distributors
demand a name actor

05:43.929 --> 05:45.700
and we just got a great one.

05:45.724 --> 05:46.736
- That's great.

05:46.760 --> 05:48.462
Did you have any name
actors turn you down?

05:48.486 --> 05:49.325
Hell yeah.

05:49.349 --> 05:50.509
Slater wanted too much money.

05:50.533 --> 05:52.293
All the baldwins were busy.

05:52.317 --> 05:54.640
Couldn't even get liotta
to read the thing.

05:54.664 --> 05:56.424
But, no, we're, we're
thrilled with Van dien.

05:56.448 --> 05:57.919
He's always been
our first choice.

05:57.943 --> 05:58.989
- Cool, cool.

05:59.013 --> 06:00.922
Tell me a little bit
about Rebecca Logan.

06:00.946 --> 06:01.889
Oh, Rebecca Logan, yeah,

06:01.913 --> 06:03.131
she's great.

06:03.155 --> 06:04.443
She's got a great string of
horror films under her belt,

06:04.467 --> 06:06.134
so she's built in a fan base.

06:06.158 --> 06:09.275
And plus she's not afraid
to show her boobs.

06:09.299 --> 06:12.209
I'm kidding, don't,
don't use that.

06:12.233 --> 06:14.695
- Uh, I also hear you have
a really cool location.

06:14.719 --> 06:15.730
Yeah, it's the bomb.

06:15.754 --> 06:16.766
We scored on this thing.

06:16.790 --> 06:18.630
I mean, we have to
travel the actors,

06:18.654 --> 06:21.426
which on our budget is tough,
but it's totally worth it.

06:21.450 --> 06:23.497
We got this old abandoned
hotel in Missouri.

06:23.521 --> 06:24.877
I mean, check it out.

06:24.901 --> 06:27.604
It's a million dollar look
for absolutely nothing.

06:27.628 --> 06:29.054
And here's the cherry.

06:29.078 --> 06:31.125
They say it's haunted.

06:31.149 --> 06:32.782
- No shit. Yeah.

06:32.806 --> 06:34.162
- You wanna elaborate
on that a little bit?

06:34.186 --> 06:35.543
Well, I mean, what's a
better place to shoot

06:35.567 --> 06:37.994
a horror movie than an actual
haunted location, right?

06:38.018 --> 06:39.513
I mean, think of the PR.

06:39.537 --> 06:42.343
It gives us something
really cool to talk about.

06:42.367 --> 06:44.047
- Do you think it's
really haunted?

06:44.071 --> 06:45.691
I don't know.

06:45.715 --> 06:47.521
I mean, for the sake
of the movie, yes.

06:47.545 --> 06:50.109
This office is haunted, my
hotel room will be haunted.

06:50.133 --> 06:52.077
If it sells tickets,
it's haunted.

06:52.101 --> 06:53.837
Jacob, watch what you say.

06:53.861 --> 06:56.184
This is for the behind the
scenes stuff on the DVD.

06:56.208 --> 06:57.358
It lives forever.

06:57.382 --> 06:59.015
What, what did I say?

06:59.039 --> 07:00.465
Let me talk about the location.

07:00.489 --> 07:02.018
You've got director stuff to do.

07:02.042 --> 07:03.985
I know, I know, I'm
casting hot female ghosts

07:04.009 --> 07:05.331
online in a few minutes anyway.

07:05.355 --> 07:06.678
They gotta show their tits.

07:06.702 --> 07:08.438
Okay, okay, go play
in your sandbox.

07:08.462 --> 07:10.889
This is a tough job you know,
but somebody's gotta do it.

07:10.913 --> 07:12.873
- Hey, thanks, Jake,
we'll catch up later.

07:12.897 --> 07:16.101
Yeah, so this is an
old hotel in Missouri

07:16.125 --> 07:18.034
we were lucky enough to get.

07:18.058 --> 07:20.485
It's got a ton of
production value.

07:20.509 --> 07:21.589
- It looks great.

07:21.613 --> 07:23.867
Um, do you think
it's really haunted?

07:23.891 --> 07:25.686
Let me show you something.

07:30.450 --> 07:34.626
Alright, this is something I
filmed while we were scouting.

07:35.075 --> 07:36.915
- What do you think,
Jacob, was I right?

07:36.939 --> 07:41.150
Yeah, this is creepy.
- Yeah, it's creepy.

07:42.634 --> 07:44.819
- It's gonna be perfect.

07:44.843 --> 07:46.856
- Whoa, Jacob, did
you catch that?

07:46.880 --> 07:48.560
It's probably the wind.
- What wind?

07:48.584 --> 07:49.962
There's no wind in here.

07:49.986 --> 07:52.448
There's no wind in
here, this guy's nuts.

07:52.472 --> 07:54.277
That was a genuine
paranormal phenomenon

07:54.301 --> 07:56.141
we captured there.

07:56.165 --> 07:59.213
While scouting for the new
movie, defanatus soul,

07:59.237 --> 08:01.584
coming to theaters near you.

08:02.551 --> 08:04.563
Awesome, right? - That was rad.

08:04.587 --> 08:06.347
Hey, I'll get you, uh,
get you the quicktime,

08:06.371 --> 08:08.602
so you can, uh, use that.
- Thanks man.

08:08.626 --> 08:11.905
Can you get a close
up of that picture?

08:18.636 --> 08:19.671
- Wow, no way.

08:20.776 --> 08:21.891
Gabe.

08:21.915 --> 08:23.720
Hey, Gabe, you see this? - What?

08:23.744 --> 08:26.885
- This figure in the hallway.

08:27.852 --> 08:29.450
No way.

08:29.474 --> 08:31.176
Jacob, come look at this.

08:31.200 --> 08:32.200
Yeah.

08:34.341 --> 08:37.354
It's a curtain or a shadow.
It's not.

08:37.378 --> 08:38.563
Oh, okay, so it's a ghost?

08:38.587 --> 08:40.496
N-, no, this proves
it's haunted.

08:40.520 --> 08:42.842
Get out of here, it's a curtain.

08:42.866 --> 08:44.638
Jacob, our resident skeptic.

08:44.662 --> 08:45.880
Realist. Denier.

08:45.904 --> 08:47.951
Yeah, whatever, I got
real ghosts to cast.

08:47.975 --> 08:50.253
I think it's cool.

08:51.289 --> 08:52.929
- Alright, well, I think
we got everything

08:52.953 --> 08:54.302
that we need for now, so...

08:54.326 --> 08:55.959
Alright, Aaron, uh, I think
we got you guys set up.

08:55.983 --> 08:57.513
You have your travel itinerary?

08:57.537 --> 08:59.169
Yeah, yeah, I got
it this morning.

08:59.193 --> 09:00.833
Great, um, yeah, well,
I'll tell you what,

09:00.857 --> 09:02.379
I will see you on location.
Cool.

09:02.403 --> 09:03.208
I think this is gonna be

09:03.232 --> 09:04.243
a fun shoot. Yeah.

09:04.267 --> 09:06.067
Especially if stuff like
that keeps happening.

09:06.091 --> 09:07.005
Yeah, we'll see.

09:07.029 --> 09:08.229
- You good?
- We got it.

09:15.624 --> 09:16.728
Hello?

09:20.421 --> 09:21.421
Hel...

09:26.911 --> 09:29.465
Okay, so I just heard a voice.

09:30.639 --> 09:31.639
I mean,

09:32.399 --> 09:35.540
I think, I just I
h-heard something.

09:36.368 --> 09:39.579
I wasn't sleeping so I w-I
mean, I wasn't dreaming.

09:40.027 --> 09:42.558
I mean, maybe I w-wasn't.

09:42.582 --> 09:45.067
I- I was dozing off maybe.

09:47.517 --> 09:50.807
Look, I heard something
loud and deep in my ear.

09:50.831 --> 09:51.808
It said, it's time, it's time.

09:51.832 --> 09:54.697
- Welcome back to
talk the talk...

09:55.042 --> 09:56.526
It's time for what?

09:59.150 --> 10:01.842
My heart is, my heart is racing.

10:05.639 --> 10:07.986
I'm documenting this because

10:11.680 --> 10:14.786
maybe by tomorrow I
don't believe it or,

10:16.098 --> 10:18.835
or because maybe
I'll just forget.

10:21.724 --> 10:24.762
I think we try and
make excuses for,

10:25.694 --> 10:29.432
for these things, these
p-p-p-paranormal things,

10:29.456 --> 10:32.504
because we, we just
don't wanna believe it.

10:32.528 --> 10:35.531
I mean, I wouldn't have
believed it before...

10:37.775 --> 10:41.295
Well, I'm a little more
open minded these days.

10:44.091 --> 10:46.784
Or I'm just out of
my fucking mind.

10:51.581 --> 10:54.343
The TV.

10:56.310 --> 10:57.484
The TV.

10:58.554 --> 11:00.274
- But I must ask,

11:00.298 --> 11:02.085
do you see a handsome
man in my future?

11:02.109 --> 11:05.261
I'm not a fortune teller,
Barbara, I'm a medium,

11:05.285 --> 11:06.607
I communicate with the dead.

11:06.631 --> 11:09.092
Oh, dead, alive, I'll
take what I can get.

11:10.221 --> 11:13.062
I'm afraid, it's all been
predestined, my dear.

11:13.086 --> 11:17.055
The future's already been
written for us, for all of us.

11:43.426 --> 11:44.773
It was the TV.

11:47.223 --> 11:48.431
It was the TV.

12:17.288 --> 12:21.499
Daniel.
- I'm sorry, have we met?

12:22.465 --> 12:23.926
Not officially,

12:23.950 --> 12:26.549
but we're gonna be working
on the movie together.

12:26.573 --> 12:27.930
You're behind the scenes, right?

12:27.954 --> 12:30.622
- Oh, yeah uh, right, right.

12:30.646 --> 12:34.453
Sidney, advisor in all
things paranormal.

12:34.477 --> 12:36.007
- Hey, it's nice to meet you.

12:36.031 --> 12:36.870
I'm Amanda.

12:36.894 --> 12:39.700
I'm art department. - Cool.

12:39.724 --> 12:43.417
Anxious to get started?
- The camera, yeah.

12:44.211 --> 12:46.293
I'm a, film junkie I guess.

12:46.317 --> 12:49.606
Well, this is about as behind
the scenes as it gets.

12:50.804 --> 12:52.884
Girls, why don't you go in
and wash out some glasses?

12:52.908 --> 12:54.128
I'll be in in two seconds.

12:54.152 --> 12:55.152
Okay.

12:56.845 --> 12:58.995
Hey, you know there's some
cute girls in the bar.

12:59.019 --> 13:01.826
Why don't you go enjoy your
last night of freedom?

13:01.850 --> 13:04.507
- Thanks, um, I'm good.

13:06.095 --> 13:07.383
Hey, l-listen, Sidney.

13:07.407 --> 13:09.281
Uh, I hate to ambush
you right now,

13:09.305 --> 13:11.939
but since this is your
area of expertise,

13:11.963 --> 13:13.563
something just happened
to me in my room.

13:13.587 --> 13:14.947
I heard a voice.
No, Daniel listen,

13:14.971 --> 13:17.082
I'm sorry but i-I'm off
the clock right now.

13:17.106 --> 13:18.774
Tomorrow I'm all yours.

13:18.798 --> 13:20.398
I promise. - Yeah, right, sorry.

13:20.422 --> 13:21.915
I'm, I'm, I'm sorry
for bothering you.

13:21.939 --> 13:25.332
I guess I'm just a little
spooked, that's all.

13:25.356 --> 13:26.516
Well, you may have heard the,

13:26.540 --> 13:28.060
the location where
we're going tomorrow

13:28.084 --> 13:28.956
is extremely active.

13:28.980 --> 13:31.165
You're probably just
projecting a bit.

13:31.189 --> 13:35.400
I'd recommend a nice stiff
nightcap to calm the nerves.

13:35.849 --> 13:38.103
I'd invite you in but, um,

13:38.127 --> 13:39.864
well, you understand.

13:39.888 --> 13:43.005
- No, no, I understand.
- I know you do.

13:43.029 --> 13:45.076
Big day tomorrow.

13:45.100 --> 13:48.310
See you on the set.
- See you tomorrow.

13:57.181 --> 13:58.917
Alright, we're almost there.

13:58.941 --> 14:01.057
Are you rolling?

14:01.081 --> 14:02.081
- One sec.

14:05.327 --> 14:06.994
And I'm good.

14:07.018 --> 14:11.033
Okay, we are about to arrive
on set for the first time.

14:11.057 --> 14:12.897
Production starts today on

14:12.921 --> 14:15.302
defantanus... - Defanatus.

14:15.924 --> 14:19.489
Defaniti, defanist...
- Defanatus soul.

14:19.513 --> 14:21.861
Defanatus, defanatus.

14:22.309 --> 14:25.392
I have da-faintest idea
how to pronounce this...

14:25.416 --> 14:26.911
Movie name.

14:26.935 --> 14:30.535
Okay, we are about to arrive
on set for the first time.

14:30.559 --> 14:34.045
Production starts today
on defanatus soul.

14:35.391 --> 14:36.391
Cool.

14:37.704 --> 14:38.923
Hi. Hey, guys.

14:38.947 --> 14:41.201
Um, we're with the
documentary crew.

14:41.225 --> 14:42.029
Ok, perfect.

14:42.053 --> 14:43.341
Um, you have your crew badge?

14:43.365 --> 14:45.101
Uh, yes I do.

14:45.125 --> 14:46.309
Alright, just make sure
you keep it with you

14:46.333 --> 14:47.655
until everyone gets to know you.

14:47.679 --> 14:48.725
Okay, will do.

14:48.749 --> 14:49.657
- Hi.

14:49.681 --> 14:51.521
That's Daniel by the way.

14:51.545 --> 14:53.340
Sarah to set, over.

14:54.238 --> 14:55.836
- Yeah, Sarah, over.

14:55.860 --> 14:58.794
Yeah, I've got the
doc crew here, over.

15:01.348 --> 15:04.707
I've got the doc...

15:04.731 --> 15:07.182
Okay, that was weird.

15:08.114 --> 15:09.367
Yeah, maybe some frequencies

15:09.391 --> 15:12.059
flying around or something.

15:12.083 --> 15:13.992
Base camp, it's Sarah. - Yeah.

15:14.016 --> 15:15.649
I already said send 'em up.

15:15.673 --> 15:16.581
Copy.

15:16.605 --> 15:17.893
Alright guys, you can go on up

15:17.917 --> 15:19.837
and someone up there will
tell you where to park.

15:19.861 --> 15:21.966
Alright, thank you.

15:21.990 --> 15:23.726
- That was weird.
- Ooh.

15:23.750 --> 15:26.684
Okay.

15:31.344 --> 15:34.530
I think I'll probably be fine
if I just pull up right here.

15:37.143 --> 15:38.765
Well, there's Gabe.

15:42.769 --> 15:44.471
Hey! Hey, guys.

15:44.495 --> 15:45.775
Go ahead and leave
your car here.

15:45.799 --> 15:47.535
We have some pas that
can unload your gear.

15:47.559 --> 15:48.993
Okay, perfect. Casper's here.

15:49.017 --> 15:50.995
Over there talking
to, uh, Jacob.

15:51.019 --> 15:52.755
So, maybe you can get
a couple of shots.

15:52.779 --> 15:54.219
Yeah, that'd be,
that'd be wonderful.

15:54.243 --> 15:55.758
Casper's in kind
of a pissy mood.

15:55.782 --> 15:57.277
Mm-hmm. Problem with the flight.

15:57.301 --> 15:59.021
Just don't get too up
in his grill, alright?

15:59.045 --> 16:00.936
- Yeah, no problem. Yep.

16:00.960 --> 16:03.041
Tell you what, I'm gonna
turn my mic pack on,

16:03.065 --> 16:04.465
so if you wanna just
hang back here.

16:04.489 --> 16:05.526
- Okay.

16:11.556 --> 16:12.972
Okay, you good?

16:14.364 --> 16:15.364
Excuse me.

16:15.388 --> 16:16.813
Casper, this is Aaron.

16:16.837 --> 16:18.517
He's producing the
behind the scenes stuff.

16:18.541 --> 16:19.782
Hi, nice to meet you.

16:19.806 --> 16:22.233
That's Daniel over there
behind the camera.

16:22.257 --> 16:26.030
Alright just not too
much shooting during,

16:26.054 --> 16:27.652
during the takes, okay?

16:27.676 --> 16:29.067
And when you do,
stay back a ways.

16:29.091 --> 16:30.862
Otherwise it fucks
up my eye line.

16:30.886 --> 16:32.036
Okay.

16:32.060 --> 16:33.313
Yeah, we don't wanna step
on your toes or anything.

16:33.337 --> 16:35.211
I just, uh, probably
gonna have to grab you

16:35.235 --> 16:37.489
every once in awhile for an
interview if that's cool.

16:37.513 --> 16:38.835
Just not too much.

16:38.859 --> 16:41.838
Even if it looks like I'm not
busy, I'm always working,

16:41.862 --> 16:43.771
getting in the zone, prepping.

16:43.795 --> 16:45.808
Don't worry, I'll, I'll
give you what you need.

16:45.832 --> 16:46.636
Of course you will.

16:46.660 --> 16:47.465
Casper's a pro, right?

16:47.489 --> 16:48.293
How many movies?

16:48.317 --> 16:50.364
I don't know, 110.

16:50.388 --> 16:51.641
Man's a superstar.

16:51.665 --> 16:53.465
Alright, well, uh, we'll
get out of your hair.

16:53.489 --> 16:55.887
Uh, I just wanted to say hello
so that you didn't wonder

16:55.911 --> 16:57.199
who the prick is with the camera

16:57.223 --> 16:59.097
who's pointing it in your face.

16:59.121 --> 17:00.788
Alright, Casper,
sorry to interrupt.

17:00.812 --> 17:03.101
Thanks very much. No
worries, it's okay.

17:03.125 --> 17:04.791
Alright, I think...

17:04.816 --> 17:06.310
We're good for out here.

17:06.335 --> 17:07.864
Um, how do we get inside?

17:07.887 --> 17:09.728
Follow me, uh... okay.

17:09.752 --> 17:12.490
- You're gonna love this
place, it's super creepy.

17:24.973 --> 17:26.675
This is dope.

17:26.700 --> 17:30.680
Make sure to get good
shots of all this stuff.

17:30.704 --> 17:32.510
Behind the scenes crew. Yeah.

17:32.534 --> 17:34.477
Aaron, this is Dan.

17:34.501 --> 17:35.861
- Hey man. Good deal guys.

17:35.885 --> 17:38.205
Uh, word of advice, stay
out of Casper's ass.

17:38.229 --> 17:39.429
He's a little bit moody today.

17:39.453 --> 17:41.139
We messed up his flight.
Yeah, sure thing.

17:41.163 --> 17:42.923
We talked to him outside so...
Hold on a sec.

17:42.947 --> 17:43.969
Go for Mike.

17:43.993 --> 17:45.212
Yeah, okay, I'll be right there.

17:45.236 --> 17:46.696
Hey, guys, listen,
I've gotta run, okay?

17:46.720 --> 17:47.732
Make yourselves at home.

17:47.756 --> 17:49.636
The door you came in is
the one that you go out.

17:49.660 --> 17:50.942
Everything else is boarded up.

17:50.966 --> 17:52.566
Stay out of the
elevators, nothing works.

17:52.590 --> 17:54.566
Makeup, right up
there on the right.

17:54.590 --> 17:55.981
Some bitching stuff
going on today.

17:56.005 --> 17:56.879
Check it out, okay?

17:56.903 --> 17:58.398
Thanks. - Sweet, thanks man.

17:58.422 --> 18:00.124
If you guys can't
get ahold of me,

18:00.148 --> 18:01.573
go ahead and get
ahold of my second.

18:01.597 --> 18:02.678
His name's Mike too, okay?

18:02.702 --> 18:03.982
He'll care of anything you need.

18:04.006 --> 18:05.686
Appreciate it, buddy.
- Thank you.

18:07.914 --> 18:09.778
Hey, guys. Oh, hey.

18:12.263 --> 18:13.263
Ladies.

18:14.023 --> 18:15.023
Hi.

18:17.061 --> 18:18.821
- Hello?
- Come on in.

18:21.272 --> 18:24.769
Oh, shit, sorry. Oh, it's fine.

18:24.793 --> 18:25.804
Join the party.

18:25.828 --> 18:27.220
You sure? Trust me.

18:27.244 --> 18:28.738
This one's not modest.

18:28.762 --> 18:30.015
Seriously, why would I care?

18:30.039 --> 18:32.199
The whole world's gonna see
me like this for the movie.

18:32.223 --> 18:33.329
Oh, the whole world.

18:33.353 --> 18:34.675
That's optimistic.

18:34.699 --> 18:36.539
I'm Aaron, behind the
scenes producer.

18:36.563 --> 18:39.024
We're just shooting some footage
for the DVD featurettes,

18:39.048 --> 18:40.440
that sort of thing.

18:40.464 --> 18:41.924
Come on, don't be shy.

18:41.948 --> 18:43.857
- Hey, I'm, uh, I'm Daniel.

18:43.881 --> 18:45.561
I'll be in your face
for next couple weeks.

18:45.585 --> 18:49.000
And my tits and my crotch.
- Okay.

18:49.024 --> 18:50.553
Uh, what was your name again?

18:50.577 --> 18:51.382
- Me?
- Yeah.

18:51.406 --> 18:52.417
Uh, Vanessa.

18:52.441 --> 18:54.281
- Great, Vanessa do
you mind describing

18:54.305 --> 18:55.745
for the viewers
what's going on here?

18:55.769 --> 18:58.665
Uh, yeah, this is one of
our creepy apparitions.

18:58.689 --> 19:01.426
I'm doing a full body makeup
on her with an airbrush.

19:01.450 --> 19:03.877
Then we'll goop up her hair,
put in some contact lenses,

19:03.901 --> 19:07.191
and instant ghost, on a budget.

19:07.215 --> 19:10.183
- Oh, sweet, what's this?

19:11.219 --> 19:13.024
Uh, those are silicon appliances

19:13.048 --> 19:14.646
for the main
creature, the demon.

19:14.670 --> 19:17.304
It'll take about four hours
to apply that makeup.

19:17.328 --> 19:18.547
- Wicked.

19:18.571 --> 19:20.531
You know, it shoots tomorrow
if you wanna be here,

19:20.555 --> 19:23.552
uh, I don't know, about 3:00 A.M.
we start the application.

19:23.576 --> 19:26.786
Ooh, 3:00 A.M., "dead time."

19:27.269 --> 19:28.629
- Alright, yeah,
we will definitely

19:28.653 --> 19:29.454
be here for that.

19:29.478 --> 19:30.869
That sounds dope.

19:30.893 --> 19:33.551
Alright, uh, we'll
leave you to it.

19:35.726 --> 19:39.178
Shit!

19:43.527 --> 19:45.781
- Hey, Dan, let's
move along buddy.

19:45.805 --> 19:47.990
- Yeah, I'm just looking around.

19:48.014 --> 19:50.855
Never know what's gonna be
around the corner, right?

19:50.879 --> 19:53.847
Let me know if you
need anything.

20:04.341 --> 20:07.482
- If you wanna just
have a seat right here.

20:09.967 --> 20:12.383
- I'm just gonna mic you.

20:26.708 --> 20:29.711
- Okay, you set?
- Uh, just one second.

20:30.298 --> 20:31.298
I'm good.

20:31.891 --> 20:33.371
- Alright well... Where do you

20:33.395 --> 20:34.105
want me looking?

20:34.129 --> 20:37.073
- If you wanna just
look at me that's fine.

20:37.097 --> 20:38.523
Okay, we're gonna start.

20:38.547 --> 20:41.526
Just introduce yourself, say
your name and who you are.

20:41.550 --> 20:43.666
My name is Sidney Barnes.

20:43.690 --> 20:46.738
I'm the technical
advisor on the movie.

20:46.762 --> 20:48.430
- And, um, how does one become

20:48.454 --> 20:51.491
a technical advisor
on a paranormal film?

20:51.940 --> 20:56.151
Well, I'm a medium and
a spiritual counselor.

20:56.910 --> 21:00.500
I've been involved
in a few exorcisms,

21:00.983 --> 21:03.962
and I hold a phd in
ancient theology.

21:03.986 --> 21:05.146
I was hired by the production

21:05.170 --> 21:07.863
to advise in paranormal aspects.

21:07.887 --> 21:10.797
You know, keeping it real, man.

21:12.754 --> 21:16.285
- I, uh, I hear a rumor
you used to be a jesuit.

21:16.309 --> 21:18.622
I've heard the same rumor.

21:19.243 --> 21:21.290
- The title, defanatus soul,

21:21.314 --> 21:23.568
can you tell me a
little about that?

21:23.592 --> 21:27.123
Defanatus is the Latin
word for desecrated,

21:27.147 --> 21:29.736
profane, unholy.

21:30.392 --> 21:32.392
- I guess we all have
a little bit of that.

21:32.416 --> 21:35.281
Some more than others, ha ha ha.

21:35.535 --> 21:38.549
- I gotcha, and uh,
this location?

21:38.573 --> 21:41.541
What about it?
- I hear it's haunted.

21:42.370 --> 21:44.348
There's a lot of energy here.

21:44.372 --> 21:46.305
I picked it up right away.

21:47.444 --> 21:50.354
- Can you elaborate?
Not right now.

21:50.378 --> 21:52.804
There's a great
deal going on here.

21:52.828 --> 21:54.219
Perhaps the best
way to explain it

21:54.243 --> 21:57.775
is to say that it's rather
like pages in a book.

21:57.799 --> 22:02.010
It takes a minute to sort through
the chapters and then...

22:02.735 --> 22:05.358
Alright, just give me a second.

22:16.714 --> 22:19.659
There are many spirits here.

22:19.683 --> 22:23.894
Some are trapped, some are
just passing through, a-...

22:29.175 --> 22:30.175
And...

22:31.936 --> 22:33.328
- And?

22:33.352 --> 22:34.792
Come on, man, don't
leave me hanging.

22:34.816 --> 22:37.681
That sounded like it
was gonna be good.

22:40.428 --> 22:43.130
There's a dark energy here.

22:43.154 --> 22:47.158
Something unspeakably
malevolent.

22:48.367 --> 22:51.197
It's shrouded, hiding,

22:52.198 --> 22:54.545
observing from the shadows,

22:56.167 --> 22:57.167
waiting.

23:01.172 --> 23:02.311
He's waiting.

23:12.287 --> 23:14.783
- Okay, Vanessa,
step out please.

23:14.807 --> 23:16.740
We need to roll on this.

23:19.294 --> 23:20.329
All yours.

23:22.435 --> 23:24.344
Camera set.

23:24.368 --> 23:26.474
Everybody settle, settle.

23:27.785 --> 23:29.591
- Roll camera.
- Speed.

23:29.615 --> 23:32.549
Scene 102, take three, Mark.

23:34.102 --> 23:35.966
- And, action!

23:42.973 --> 23:46.124
- I can't make it Maxwell.
- Shh, keep it down.

23:46.148 --> 23:48.357
They're attracted to the noise.

23:57.505 --> 24:00.656
Here, let me take
a look at that.

24:00.680 --> 24:03.072
Uh, just leave me here.

24:03.096 --> 24:04.833
No, are you crazy?

24:04.857 --> 24:07.387
I'm no good to you like this,
I'm just slowing you down.

24:07.411 --> 24:09.354
We're so close to getting
out of this hotel.

24:09.378 --> 24:11.391
And you'll find a way
out faster without me.

24:11.415 --> 24:12.841
- No.
- I'll be fine here.

24:12.865 --> 24:15.568
- No.
- Maxwell, you know it's true.

24:15.592 --> 24:18.387
You'll have better
luck by yourself.

24:22.599 --> 24:25.153
I'll be back, I promise.

24:32.712 --> 24:34.507
Some vacation, huh?

24:36.060 --> 24:39.937
We came here together, we're
gonna leave together.

24:39.961 --> 24:42.170
I'm holding you to that.

24:58.635 --> 25:00.360
I love you, Maxwell.

25:03.605 --> 25:05.065
- And cut, we got it.

25:05.089 --> 25:06.826
- Jacob, we good?
Yeah, we're good.

25:06.850 --> 25:07.896
Let's turn it around.

25:07.920 --> 25:09.138
- Okay, everyone.
- Great take.

25:09.162 --> 25:10.139
- That was the one.
- We are turning it around.

25:10.163 --> 25:11.140
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

25:11.164 --> 25:13.280
- Uh, it felt good.
- Yeah.

25:13.304 --> 25:16.456
- Yeah, that was great.
- Thanks.

25:16.480 --> 25:18.400
Do you mind if we grab you
for a quick interview?

25:18.424 --> 25:19.632
Uh, that's fine.

25:19.656 --> 25:21.634
You got some time
before the next setup.

25:21.658 --> 25:24.326
Sure, um, let me just go
make a quick phone call

25:24.350 --> 25:25.569
and then I'm yours.

25:25.593 --> 25:27.193
Cool, we're gonna find
a place to set up,

25:27.217 --> 25:29.565
and then I'll come grab you.

25:30.632 --> 25:32.714
Kill him.

25:32.738 --> 25:36.165
- Whoa, what'd, what
did you just say?

25:36.189 --> 25:37.926
I didn't say anything.

25:37.950 --> 25:39.790
- No, no, no, that's
messed up, man.

25:39.814 --> 25:42.689
I-, you said, "kill him."

25:42.713 --> 25:45.727
I'm pretty sure I didn't tell
you to kill Casper Van dien.

25:45.751 --> 25:48.177
- Okay, so I'm hearing things?

25:48.201 --> 25:49.178
Dude, what's up with you?

25:49.202 --> 25:51.180
You feeling okay?

25:51.204 --> 25:54.252
- Whatever, i- i-I
know that was you.

25:54.276 --> 25:55.516
Alright, well, let's just focus

25:55.540 --> 25:57.428
on getting this
interview, alright?

25:57.452 --> 25:58.256
- Yeah.

25:58.280 --> 25:59.696
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

26:00.938 --> 26:03.468
Shit, Sidney, you scare-.

26:03.492 --> 26:05.263
You scared the crap out of me.

26:05.287 --> 26:08.543
The energy in here's getting
much stronger, Daniel.

26:08.567 --> 26:11.615
You should check your
footage very carefully.

26:11.639 --> 26:13.479
There's no telling what
you might have captured

26:13.503 --> 26:14.997
while you were shooting.

26:15.021 --> 26:16.901
- Yeah, you know, i-I
could have swore

26:16.925 --> 26:19.519
I heard something in my ear.

26:19.543 --> 26:21.590
I have no doubt.

26:21.614 --> 26:23.972
He's probably messing
with all you people,

26:23.996 --> 26:27.907
but they don't believe it
or they don't even know it.

26:27.931 --> 26:30.012
If I were you, I'd,

26:30.036 --> 26:32.187
I'd stay on my toes.

26:32.211 --> 26:34.983
Look, I'm, I'm gonna
grab some grub.

26:35.007 --> 26:38.124
I think my blood sugar's
beginning to drop.

26:38.148 --> 26:42.197
Can I get you anything?

26:42.221 --> 26:44.924
- No, I'm good, thank you.

26:44.948 --> 26:47.433
Well, alright then.

26:49.297 --> 26:52.276
Yeah, it was probably him.
- What do you mean?

26:52.300 --> 26:54.865
He's probably the one who
whispered "kill him" in your ear.

26:54.889 --> 26:56.689
I mean, think about it,
he's probably got like

26:56.713 --> 26:59.041
a million ex-wives he's
gotta pay alimony to.

26:59.065 --> 27:01.354
I mean, it makes sense, right?

27:01.378 --> 27:03.018
You know, he's gotta
milk the spooky stuff

27:03.042 --> 27:04.665
for a fat paycheck.

27:05.554 --> 27:08.326
Alright, I'm gonna go grab
Casper, you get ready.

27:08.350 --> 27:09.766
Alright? - Alright, cool.

27:14.702 --> 27:17.715
- Alright, I'm set.
- Okay, Casper Van dien.

27:17.739 --> 27:19.130
Thanks for doing this, brother.

27:19.154 --> 27:20.338
Hey no problem.

27:20.362 --> 27:23.307
There or there?
- Right at me is fine.

27:23.331 --> 27:25.689
Cool, um, what lens
are you using?

27:25.713 --> 27:28.933
- Uh, we're on a 75. Then
I'll look right there.

27:28.957 --> 27:31.487
- Okay, I guess you've
done this before.

27:31.511 --> 27:32.765
A few times.

27:32.789 --> 27:34.214
- Alright, here we go.

27:34.238 --> 27:37.286
So, tell me how you got
involved with this film.

27:37.310 --> 27:39.357
I got involved with
defanatus soul,

27:39.381 --> 27:42.153
because I fell in
love with the script.

27:42.177 --> 27:44.155
I think it speaks
very eloquently

27:44.179 --> 27:46.295
to our innate fear of death

27:46.319 --> 27:50.530
and it shines a light on the
paranormal in a fresh, new way.

27:51.152 --> 27:53.717
Are ghosts trapped souls,

27:53.741 --> 27:57.745
or are they a manifestation
of quantum physics?

27:58.193 --> 28:01.448
Beings trapped in a
parallel universe.

28:01.472 --> 28:03.485
Is this real life here?

28:03.509 --> 28:06.315
Or are we all dead right now?

28:06.339 --> 28:07.869
- What do you think?

28:07.893 --> 28:09.077
Oh, man.

28:09.101 --> 28:11.182
To each his own, you know?

28:11.206 --> 28:13.253
I believe in keeping
an open mind

28:13.277 --> 28:15.462
as long as you have
both eyes open too.

28:15.486 --> 28:16.671
- I gotcha.

28:16.695 --> 28:20.157
And, uh, tell me how it is
working with Rebecca Logan.

28:20.181 --> 28:23.056
Becca is a sweetheart and
a tremendous talent,

28:23.080 --> 28:24.230
top notch.

28:24.254 --> 28:26.254
I think we'll be seeing a
lot of her in the future.

28:26.278 --> 28:27.751
- I think so too.

28:27.775 --> 28:29.304
Alright, one more
question for now,

28:29.328 --> 28:30.888
'cause I know you gotta
get back to work

28:30.912 --> 28:32.963
and, um, we'll grab you for
some more stuff later,

28:32.987 --> 28:37.198
but, uh, have you encountered
any ghosts yourself?

28:37.405 --> 28:38.658
What, here?

28:38.682 --> 28:40.270
- Anywhere.

28:42.410 --> 28:45.630
I, I lived in a house once
back in the late '80s

28:45.654 --> 28:48.150
that I think was haunted.

28:48.174 --> 28:50.428
Things would move around.

28:50.452 --> 28:52.983
The TV would go on and
off all by itself.

28:53.007 --> 28:55.457
So, yeah, I, I believe in it.

28:56.527 --> 28:57.874
- And here?

28:59.323 --> 29:02.982
Uh, this place is
definitely spooky,

29:03.431 --> 29:06.582
but what better place
to film a ghost movie

29:06.606 --> 29:09.275
than in a haunted hotel, right?

29:09.299 --> 29:11.553
I mean, this is the
perfect backdrop

29:11.577 --> 29:13.037
for the story we're
trying to tell,

29:13.061 --> 29:17.238
and I think the location
gives it a layer of truth.

29:17.548 --> 29:20.838
I think the audience will
feel an authenticity

29:20.862 --> 29:23.807
that we couldn't have
achieved if we had, you know,

29:23.831 --> 29:26.212
built a set on a soundstage.

29:27.386 --> 29:30.848
- Okay, great, I
think that'll do it.

29:30.872 --> 29:32.194
Thank you Mr. Van dien.

29:32.218 --> 29:33.506
I'll take that

29:33.530 --> 29:34.890
mic pack from you.
Yeah, this place

29:34.914 --> 29:35.819
is really creepy.

29:35.843 --> 29:38.062
You know, I've had the hair
on the back of my neck

29:38.086 --> 29:39.443
stand up a few times.

29:39.467 --> 29:42.687
Yeah, well, Daniel's
been hearing voices.

29:42.711 --> 29:45.749
- It was one, one voice.

29:46.198 --> 29:47.751
What did it say?

29:48.614 --> 29:52.767
- Nothing, just like a, nothing.

29:52.791 --> 29:54.699
- Anyway, you got a long night?

29:54.723 --> 29:57.875
Uh, no, I think, uh, only
got one more quick scene

29:57.899 --> 30:00.775
and then I can
squeeze in a swim.

30:00.799 --> 30:03.778
Cool, and a few cocktails?

30:03.802 --> 30:05.710
22 years sober.

30:05.734 --> 30:07.022
Cool.

30:07.046 --> 30:08.230
Uh, thanks my main man.

30:08.254 --> 30:10.957
Alright, thank you.
Thank you, Casper.

30:10.981 --> 30:12.717
You wanna do a little interview?

30:12.741 --> 30:14.823
Yeah, come on.

30:14.847 --> 30:16.727
- Alright, alright, alri...
do a little

30:16.751 --> 30:18.511
director of the bts.

30:22.130 --> 30:24.971
- So Daniel, what brings you
to this film set today?

30:24.995 --> 30:27.491
Is it the crappy script, the
terrible catered lunches,

30:27.515 --> 30:28.906
or the hot naked chicks?

30:28.930 --> 30:31.529
Ooh, a lot of reasons, um.

30:31.553 --> 30:34.878
Well, I always thought I'd be
an award-winning filmmaker.

30:34.902 --> 30:35.740
You know, my name up there

30:35.764 --> 30:39.044
with kubrick,
Spielberg, Whitaker.

30:39.768 --> 30:41.367
You know, my mom thought so too.

30:41.391 --> 30:42.333
- Oh, I love your mom,

30:42.357 --> 30:43.917
she's a sweet lady.
She is a sweet lady.

30:43.941 --> 30:46.096
No, but instead I
get to document

30:46.120 --> 30:48.926
this piece of sh-, piece of art.

30:48.950 --> 30:52.619
How lucky am I?

30:52.643 --> 30:56.589
Okay, everyone, we are
back, we are back!

30:56.613 --> 30:59.005
- And how about this
spooky location?

30:59.029 --> 31:00.731
Have you seen any spooky ghosts?

31:00.755 --> 31:01.939
Well, you know what?

31:01.963 --> 31:05.598
I was not a believer before,
but I have been converted.

31:05.622 --> 31:06.599
I have been delivered.

31:06.623 --> 31:07.876
Can I get an amen?

31:07.900 --> 31:09.074
- Amen. Amen.

31:09.971 --> 31:12.467
You know, one thing has
been proven today,

31:12.491 --> 31:14.918
beyond a shadow of a doubt.

31:14.942 --> 31:18.369
Ghosts are real,
real horse shit.

31:18.393 --> 31:20.544
Oh my god.

31:21.776 --> 31:23.456
- Casper just flew
off the balcony.

31:23.480 --> 31:25.100
- What?
- Grab the camera.

31:25.124 --> 31:27.747
Shit.

31:31.820 --> 31:33.937
Holy shit, holy shit.

31:33.961 --> 31:37.526
- Daniel come on, get down here.

31:37.550 --> 31:40.357
Casper! Everyone back
up, okay, back up!

31:40.381 --> 31:42.152
Someone get on the
walkie right now.

31:42.176 --> 31:43.291
Notify base camp.

31:43.315 --> 31:45.293
We need an ambulance now.

31:45.317 --> 31:47.951
Come on man.

31:47.975 --> 31:50.022
What is that? I don't know.

31:50.046 --> 31:52.093
All the walkies are mal...

32:06.786 --> 32:08.454
Casper, come on, buddy.

32:08.478 --> 32:09.420
Come on buddy, stay with me.

32:09.444 --> 32:10.732
We're gonna get you some help.

32:10.756 --> 32:13.631
Someone get the fuck on
your phone and dial 911.

32:13.655 --> 32:15.185
- Mine's dead.
- Mine too.

32:15.209 --> 32:16.738
I know it was charged.

32:16.762 --> 32:18.867
- Mine's dead.
- What, no!

32:20.110 --> 32:22.906
No, no, no, Casper, Casper!

32:29.223 --> 32:31.363
- What the fuck?
- Daniel.

32:32.881 --> 32:34.204
Daniel.

32:34.228 --> 32:35.228
Daniel!

32:36.023 --> 32:38.311
Come one man, not now.

32:38.335 --> 32:39.681
- What, what...

32:41.062 --> 32:43.213
You are not welcome here!

32:43.237 --> 32:45.594
You must leave here at once!

32:45.618 --> 32:47.942
These people are not
here to harm you

32:47.966 --> 32:50.013
or disturb you in any way.

32:50.037 --> 32:51.359
You must leave them alone,

32:51.383 --> 32:54.776
in the name of the father and
the son and the holy spirit.

33:11.368 --> 33:12.932
This is ridiculous.

33:12.956 --> 33:14.516
Is this a fucking joke?
Is this a prank?

33:14.540 --> 33:15.970
Depart then, impious one.

33:15.994 --> 33:17.316
Depart, accursed one.

33:17.340 --> 33:18.903
Depart will all your deceits,

33:18.927 --> 33:20.491
for god has ordained that man

33:20.515 --> 33:22.804
should receive his holy temple.

33:22.828 --> 33:25.048
Why do you still linger here?

33:25.072 --> 33:27.050
Give honor to god,
the father almighty,

33:27.074 --> 33:30.018
before whom every knee must bow.

33:45.816 --> 33:46.828
Almighty god,

33:46.852 --> 33:48.968
father of our lord and
savior, Jesus Christ,

33:48.992 --> 33:52.558
he that hath regenerated thee
by water and the holy spirit,

33:52.582 --> 33:55.250
and granted thee remission
of all thy sins,

33:55.274 --> 33:58.657
anoint thee unto life
everlasting, amen.

34:01.349 --> 34:03.189
What the hell?

34:03.213 --> 34:05.595
What the hell just happened?

34:06.699 --> 34:08.045
Was it poison?

34:09.150 --> 34:10.817
Was everyone poisoned at lunch?

34:10.841 --> 34:12.241
- We all ate the same thing.

34:12.264 --> 34:13.993
It's him.

34:14.016 --> 34:15.995
He doesn't want us here.

34:16.018 --> 34:17.203
He never did.

34:17.226 --> 34:19.170
- Who?
- The dark energy.

34:19.195 --> 34:21.034
I told you it was strong.

34:21.059 --> 34:22.346
- Oh, come on,

34:22.370 --> 34:24.245
you're saying this
was done by a ghost?

34:24.268 --> 34:25.589
Are you out of your
freaking mind?

34:25.612 --> 34:27.213
Oh, it's not a ghost.

34:27.237 --> 34:29.895
It's something much, much more,

34:30.792 --> 34:32.217
and it's still here.

34:32.242 --> 34:34.496
Give me a break. I'm
getting out of here.

34:34.520 --> 34:36.188
There's no such thing as ghosts.

34:36.212 --> 34:40.078
And if you think there
are, you're an asshole.

34:42.389 --> 34:45.128
God, this is not how today
was supposed to go!

34:45.152 --> 34:47.475
Screw you, screw you!

34:47.498 --> 34:50.132
You can't do this to
me, not on my set!

34:50.157 --> 34:51.134
This is my set!

34:51.158 --> 34:52.306
This is my movie!

34:52.331 --> 34:55.275
- Jacob, don't.
- Don't what?

34:55.300 --> 34:56.380
Don't anger him?

34:56.404 --> 34:58.417
Please, I'm the one who's
angry, I'm pissed!

34:58.441 --> 35:01.247
You're a pathetic joke.

35:08.209 --> 35:10.636
- Stay, stay away from him.

35:10.660 --> 35:11.940
- We have to help him.

35:11.964 --> 35:14.950
- You can't, you can't help him.

35:20.290 --> 35:24.156
Well Daniel, how's
this for original?

35:25.226 --> 35:29.437
Have you ever seen a man
die quite this horribly?

35:37.342 --> 35:43.382
Ri-bono shel olom, y'hi rotzon
mil'fonecho... she-yih-yeh -

35:49.906 --> 35:53.496
The smell.

35:54.497 --> 35:57.051
- I smell it too, it's terrible.

35:57.431 --> 36:01.297
It's him, he's right
here, standing with us,

36:03.126 --> 36:05.093
admiring his handiwork.

36:07.786 --> 36:09.936
What do you want with us?

36:09.960 --> 36:12.422
We're not here to harm you!

36:12.446 --> 36:14.286
You've taken enough souls.

36:14.310 --> 36:17.047
It's enough now, let us go.

36:17.071 --> 36:18.900
Oh, my god, look.

36:19.349 --> 36:20.454
- Come on...

36:22.214 --> 36:23.836
- Rebecca,

36:24.872 --> 36:28.472
Rebecca, darling,
come over here to us.

36:28.496 --> 36:29.877
What happened?

36:30.947 --> 36:34.409
There's a dark entity
in this hotel,

36:34.433 --> 36:37.643
and it, it attacked
everyone, Rebecca.

36:39.438 --> 36:40.543
Oh, my god!

36:42.269 --> 36:44.833
- Just come over here to us.

36:44.857 --> 36:46.249
Come on, sweetie.

36:46.273 --> 36:48.630
Why, why aren't you dead?

36:48.654 --> 36:50.598
- I don't know.

36:50.622 --> 36:51.840
We don't know.

36:51.864 --> 36:54.024
- Come on, Rebecca, just
get out of the mess.

36:54.048 --> 36:55.534
We'll get you all cleaned up.

36:55.558 --> 36:59.331
Oh, my god, they're dead!

36:59.355 --> 37:01.091
Everyone is dead!

37:01.115 --> 37:03.507
- Come on, just walk this way.

37:03.531 --> 37:04.957
Oh!

37:04.981 --> 37:08.167
- Oh, god, the smell, it's back.

37:08.191 --> 37:09.548
I smell it too.

37:11.884 --> 37:13.276
What's going on?

37:13.300 --> 37:15.243
Where, where did these
flies come from?

37:15.267 --> 37:17.728
It's him, it's all him.

37:17.752 --> 37:20.731
- What can we do? Nothing.

37:20.755 --> 37:23.009
Don't you guys get it?

37:25.898 --> 37:27.003
Oh, no.

37:30.178 --> 37:31.801
- Rebecca?

37:34.735 --> 37:36.771
- It's not Rebecca.

37:40.050 --> 37:43.029
God, father of our
lord, Jesus Christ,

37:43.053 --> 37:44.755
I appeal to your holy name,

37:44.779 --> 37:46.585
humbly begging your kindness

37:46.609 --> 37:49.691
that you graciously Grant
me help against this

37:49.715 --> 37:52.349
and every unclean
spirit now tormenting

37:52.373 --> 37:56.491
this group of mortals through
Christ our lord, amen.

37:56.515 --> 37:58.252
You're powerless old man.

37:58.276 --> 38:00.557
- Let's get out of here.
- I got it, man.

38:00.581 --> 38:02.428
- Sidney, it's not working.

38:02.452 --> 38:03.533
Why isn't it working?

38:03.557 --> 38:05.673
- God, father of our
lord, Jesus Christ,

38:05.697 --> 38:07.364
I appeal to your holy name,

38:07.388 --> 38:09.348
humbly begging your kindness...

38:09.372 --> 38:10.812
- That you graciously Grant me

38:10.836 --> 38:12.990
help against this and
every unclean spirit

38:13.014 --> 38:15.476
now tormenting this
group of mortals

38:15.500 --> 38:18.133
through Christ our lord, amen!

38:18.157 --> 38:20.197
- Aaron, let go. Let's
get out of here now.

38:20.221 --> 38:22.379
- Aaron I got it.
You've lost your way,

38:22.403 --> 38:24.968
and without faith
your words are empty.

38:24.992 --> 38:27.281
You're as hollow as those
horrid daytime talk shows

38:27.305 --> 38:29.248
you've gotten so comfortable on.

38:29.272 --> 38:31.250
Daniel, stay back.

38:31.274 --> 38:33.563
Oh, so you do have
some sense left.

38:33.587 --> 38:36.359
You recognize the dominant
power when it's in your face.

38:36.383 --> 38:40.259
Extracting the life
from your sad carcass.

38:50.811 --> 38:53.617
- She's dead.

38:53.641 --> 38:57.414
You killed her.
- Ah, I didn't kill her.

38:57.438 --> 38:59.451
She was already gone.

38:59.475 --> 39:02.661
He was just using her,
talking through her.

39:02.685 --> 39:05.388
Talking through,
th-that's insane.

39:05.412 --> 39:06.527
This isn't happening.

39:06.551 --> 39:08.770
Oh, it's happening all right,

39:08.794 --> 39:11.255
but I've never seen
anything like this,

39:11.279 --> 39:13.810
nothing this determined.

39:13.834 --> 39:15.812
- I need to swap batteries.

39:15.836 --> 39:17.365
- Why are you still filming?

39:17.389 --> 39:18.539
This is sick.

39:18.563 --> 39:19.850
- Look, this is the
only proof we have

39:19.874 --> 39:21.194
of any of this
happening, alright?

39:21.218 --> 39:22.778
Nobody's gonna believe
us, but I got it.

39:22.802 --> 39:24.096
I got everything.

39:24.120 --> 39:25.891
He's right, he's right.

39:25.915 --> 39:29.343
We should film
everything, in case...

39:29.367 --> 39:31.714
In case we die, just say it.

39:44.174 --> 39:46.670
I cannot find a way out.

39:46.694 --> 39:50.605
All the windows are either
boarded up, shatterproof.

39:50.629 --> 39:52.089
All the doors are frozen.

39:52.113 --> 39:53.297
Why is he doing this?

39:53.321 --> 39:56.577
Why, why would he kill all
those people and not us?

39:56.601 --> 39:59.638
Think of a demon as... Fire.

40:00.398 --> 40:04.378
It burns, it destroys,
but it uses fuel.

40:04.402 --> 40:05.965
When a fire gets out of control,

40:05.989 --> 40:08.278
it consumes everything
in its path,

40:08.302 --> 40:10.073
except then finally it just

40:10.097 --> 40:13.214
runs out of fuel
and it dies out.

40:13.238 --> 40:15.285
This thing used
up so much energy

40:15.309 --> 40:16.735
manifesting the way that it did,

40:16.759 --> 40:18.530
that if it had taken
us all at once,

40:18.554 --> 40:21.774
it would have just burned out.

40:21.798 --> 40:24.363
So, it's saving us for
later, we're dessert.

40:24.387 --> 40:26.261
Saving us for something.

40:26.285 --> 40:28.840
Believe me, it has a plan.

40:29.634 --> 40:32.026
None of this has
happened by accident.

40:32.050 --> 40:33.476
This one's smart.

40:33.500 --> 40:35.374
I'm not gonna be fuel.

40:35.398 --> 40:37.203
I'm getting us out of here.

40:42.405 --> 40:44.511
What is so fucking funny?

40:45.995 --> 40:48.111
Seriously old man, hello?

40:48.135 --> 40:49.457
There's nothing funny here.

40:49.481 --> 40:50.872
- Aaron. Relax.

40:50.896 --> 40:54.048
I'm not laughing
at you, exactly.

40:54.072 --> 40:55.912
Ha ha, I'm just
amused by the fact

40:55.936 --> 40:57.176
that you seem to think you have

40:57.200 --> 40:59.087
any control over this at all.

40:59.111 --> 41:00.991
- Look, guys, this is not
helping the situation.

41:01.015 --> 41:02.815
Hey, Daniel, why don't
you stay out of this.

41:02.839 --> 41:04.230
- Aaron, you need to
calm down, alright?

41:04.254 --> 41:05.974
Dumping on Sidney's not
gonna help anything.

41:05.998 --> 41:07.199
Hey, guys, stop it, okay?

41:07.223 --> 41:08.994
We need to stay
together as a team.

41:09.018 --> 41:11.375
It's not going to matter.

41:11.399 --> 41:12.963
Why are you so negative?

41:12.987 --> 41:17.002
Have you seen what the
thing's capable of?

41:17.026 --> 41:18.003
Yeah.

41:18.027 --> 41:21.006
No, no, no, I mean have
you really seen it?

41:21.030 --> 41:23.249
Darling, I've studied these
phenomena all my life

41:23.273 --> 41:27.012
and I have never, never, seen
anything like this, ever.

41:27.036 --> 41:29.497
Well, that doesn't mean that
we can't stop it somehow.

41:29.521 --> 41:32.120
Son, we're dealing with a
power of the universe here.

41:32.144 --> 41:35.745
Something that human beings
aren't able to comprehend.

41:35.769 --> 41:38.748
The brightest minds in
particle physics and cosmology

41:38.772 --> 41:42.500
and quantum mechanics don't
even begin to understand it.

41:43.224 --> 41:46.307
Sorry, I'm just being real.

41:46.331 --> 41:47.891
- Yeah, well keep it to yourself

41:47.915 --> 41:49.310
because it's not helping us.

41:49.334 --> 41:50.242
Wait, guys.

41:50.266 --> 41:51.519
You hear that?

41:52.510 --> 41:54.936
Come on, let's go, let's go.

41:54.960 --> 41:57.007
- Why are we running
toward the noise?

41:57.031 --> 41:58.630
- 'Cause it might
be help that's why.

41:58.654 --> 41:59.734
- I don't know
anything about that.

41:59.758 --> 42:01.184
I don't like it. Well,
then just stay back!

42:01.208 --> 42:02.488
You know, Van-, Vanessa's right.

42:02.512 --> 42:04.394
I don't have a good
feeling about this.

42:04.418 --> 42:05.257
Oh, you don't have
a good feeling.

42:05.281 --> 42:08.042
Well, with all due
respect, Sidney,

42:08.767 --> 42:10.883
if you had any psychic
ability whatsoever,

42:10.907 --> 42:12.195
we would not be in this mess.

42:12.219 --> 42:14.024
- Now what does that mean?

42:14.048 --> 42:15.888
It means you woulda
seen it coming.

42:15.912 --> 42:16.820
Oh, just leave him alone.

42:16.844 --> 42:17.821
No one could have expected

42:17.845 --> 42:19.485
that what happened today
was gonna happen.

42:19.509 --> 42:20.444
Well, he should have,

42:20.468 --> 42:21.618
I mean, if any of this crap

42:21.642 --> 42:23.689
was even real in
the first place.

42:23.713 --> 42:25.433
- It doesn't work
like that, Aaron.

42:25.457 --> 42:28.556
I-, i-, I get impressions,
i-, I sense things,

42:28.580 --> 42:30.869
and I sensed this presence,
I talked about it.

42:30.893 --> 42:33.527
Yeah, well, why
didn't you warn us?

42:33.551 --> 42:35.114
Oh right, oh hey, guys,

42:35.138 --> 42:37.461
I recommend that you shut
down the production right now

42:37.485 --> 42:41.224
and get out of the building
because I've got a bad feeling.

42:41.248 --> 42:42.743
Okay, single file now.

42:42.767 --> 42:44.365
Oh, come on, get real man.

42:46.184 --> 42:47.817
- Wait, that, where...

42:47.841 --> 42:49.441
Where's that coming
from, do you hear it?

42:49.465 --> 42:50.580
It's coming from over here.

42:52.466 --> 42:54.858
Maybe there's,
someone's trapped.

42:54.882 --> 42:55.882
Hello?

43:00.474 --> 43:02.417
Oh, shit.

43:02.441 --> 43:04.454
Hello, hello, who's in there?

43:04.478 --> 43:06.318
We're stuck, we need help.

43:06.342 --> 43:08.793
- Aaron, is that you?

43:10.070 --> 43:13.636
Yes, yes, it's me, who is this?

43:13.660 --> 43:17.812
- Open the door, please,
I can't get to it.

43:17.836 --> 43:19.320
Careful, Aaron.

43:34.957 --> 43:35.957
Aaron.

43:37.684 --> 43:38.684
Mom?

43:40.238 --> 43:41.664
Mom, what are you doing here?

43:41.688 --> 43:43.700
- Aaron.

43:43.724 --> 43:46.703
Aaron, look at me
man, look at me.

43:46.727 --> 43:49.188
That's not your mom, alright?

43:49.212 --> 43:50.500
Your mom died a long time ago.

43:50.524 --> 43:52.940
You know that, you know that.

43:54.045 --> 43:56.679
Mom, mom, he's right.

43:56.703 --> 43:58.646
You can't be here.

43:58.670 --> 44:01.235
I'm right here, Aaron.

44:01.259 --> 44:05.470
I came to visit you, but
I've been alone in here.

44:06.022 --> 44:08.967
I had a bite to eat
while I was waiting.

44:08.991 --> 44:10.762
I hope that's okay.

44:10.786 --> 44:13.937
Yeah, yeah, of course it's okay.

44:13.961 --> 44:15.825
I missed you, Aaron.

44:16.964 --> 44:18.414
Take me home.

44:19.449 --> 44:22.256
I missed you too, mom, so much.

44:22.280 --> 44:26.087
Aaron, let's go, it's
just one of his tricks.

44:26.111 --> 44:27.779
Shut up, Sidney!

44:27.803 --> 44:30.288
Just leave me alone.

44:31.116 --> 44:33.912
- Aaron, this is
not your mother.

44:34.706 --> 44:36.926
I think you know that.

44:36.950 --> 44:39.860
We need to go,
right now, please.

44:39.884 --> 44:42.759
Stay with me Aaron.

44:42.783 --> 44:44.692
Leave your friends.

44:44.716 --> 44:47.961
I need you, I need you.

44:50.273 --> 44:52.907
Mom, I can't, you're not,

44:52.931 --> 44:54.588
you're not real.

44:55.140 --> 44:59.258
Ugh, something's not right, son.

44:59.282 --> 45:00.777
I don't feel well.

45:00.801 --> 45:01.916
What's wrong, just
tell me what's wrong.

45:01.940 --> 45:03.940
- Aaron, Aaron.
- I'll get help I promise.

45:03.964 --> 45:05.552
Where does it hurt?

45:06.151 --> 45:08.050
Oh, oh, my god.

45:08.291 --> 45:10.304
- Holy shit, Aaron,
Aaron, come on man.

45:10.328 --> 45:11.305
- Don't give in, Aaron.

45:11.329 --> 45:14.342
It's feeding on your
emotions, your fears.

45:14.366 --> 45:16.862
- Ah, Jesus, oh my god...

45:16.886 --> 45:18.761
- Aaron.
- Stay with me, Aaron.

45:18.785 --> 45:21.487
- Aaron.
- Stay with mommy.

45:21.511 --> 45:25.077
I missed you so much.
- Aaron, come on man.

45:25.101 --> 45:26.941
- Come on man.
- Ugh, ugh.

45:26.965 --> 45:29.047
- Aaron!
- That's it.

45:29.071 --> 45:30.358
That's a good boy.

45:30.382 --> 45:32.706
- Aaron, Daniel,
right now, get out.

45:32.730 --> 45:34.155
- Come on.

45:37.355 --> 45:40.196
Aaron!

45:40.220 --> 45:42.957
- Aaron, where's Aaron?

45:42.981 --> 45:45.511
- Get away from her,
she's not real.

45:45.535 --> 45:47.535
- Aaron, you hear me
open the door, Aaron.

45:47.559 --> 45:49.067
Open the door, come on!

45:49.091 --> 45:50.240
Daniel, stand back.

45:50.264 --> 45:53.002
I'm gonna kick the
son of a bitch in.

45:53.026 --> 45:55.338
- Ah, oh!
- Oh god.

45:56.650 --> 45:59.066
Jesus, stand back.

45:59.568 --> 46:00.768
Don't look at him. Oh, my god.

46:00.792 --> 46:01.804
Don't... - get off me.

46:01.828 --> 46:04.865
- Oh god, oh, okay, okay.

46:06.211 --> 46:10.181
Aaron!

46:16.014 --> 46:17.014
God damn!

46:24.782 --> 46:26.749
- Daniel, are you okay?

46:32.824 --> 46:34.895
I'm fine... I'm fine.

46:38.623 --> 46:41.626
We need to, we need
to stay focused.

46:44.284 --> 46:46.251
We need to keep moving.

46:48.529 --> 46:50.152
Give me the camera.

46:53.465 --> 46:54.465
Oh god.

46:59.471 --> 47:01.864
Is this thing just
going to kill us all?

47:01.888 --> 47:04.936
I mean, is this where
we all just wrap it up?

47:04.960 --> 47:06.730
It could be,

47:06.754 --> 47:08.954
but I've still got a little
piss and vinegar left in me.

47:08.978 --> 47:11.740
Let's keep looking
for a way out.

47:18.905 --> 47:20.883
- Shit! What is
it, what's wrong?

47:20.907 --> 47:22.850
- Take the camera.
- What?

47:22.874 --> 47:25.991
- Take the camera and point
it into that mirror.

47:34.334 --> 47:36.508
Wh-, what is it, Daniel?

47:38.683 --> 47:40.764
I saw something, I
swear I saw something.

47:40.788 --> 47:44.907
Look, we're all more
susceptible right now.

47:44.931 --> 47:49.142
That's what paranormal energy
does, it breaks you down.

47:50.005 --> 47:54.216
It, it was me but it,
wasn't, it wasn't me.

47:54.526 --> 47:55.779
I swear, I saw something.

47:55.803 --> 47:57.264
It's okay, Daniel, it's okay.

47:57.288 --> 48:00.163
These things play tricks
on us all the time.

48:00.187 --> 48:01.440
They relish it.

48:01.464 --> 48:04.581
They thrive on causing
misery and confusion.

48:04.605 --> 48:08.092
That's where they get their
power, their energy.

48:08.851 --> 48:11.578
I swear, I, I saw it.

48:13.166 --> 48:15.858
After everything we've
seen today, Daniel,

48:16.445 --> 48:18.309
no one's doubting you.

48:29.768 --> 48:32.633
- Ugh, there, let's go.

48:32.979 --> 48:37.190
- At least he'll, you know,
be preserved in here.

48:38.329 --> 48:39.789
Daniel, son?

48:39.813 --> 48:41.849
Come on let's go. - Yeah.

48:49.616 --> 48:52.388
- Guys, stairs.

48:52.412 --> 48:54.652
Lights aren't working.
- Hold on, I have infrared

48:54.676 --> 48:56.530
on the camera, night vision.

48:56.554 --> 48:59.315
Slow and steady, we'll be fine.

49:05.218 --> 49:08.946
- So, in case anyone finds
this recording, this,

49:09.360 --> 49:12.442
this recording that
has outlived us,

49:12.466 --> 49:14.997
we are the last survivors.

49:15.021 --> 49:17.402
We, we witnessed
the murder, or...

49:18.472 --> 49:22.683
Or demise of the entire crew
at the hands of someone,

49:22.960 --> 49:24.478
so-, some,

49:25.307 --> 49:26.756
some being, some,

49:28.655 --> 49:31.289
some... thing unexplainable.

49:31.313 --> 49:33.429
- It's another kitchen.

49:33.453 --> 49:35.776
- Aaron is now dead,

49:35.800 --> 49:38.768
and we placed his
body in the cooler.

49:39.114 --> 49:43.325
Unless we find a way out,
we're probably next.

49:43.773 --> 49:45.959
- Ugh.

49:45.983 --> 49:47.961
- There are no
working elevators.

49:47.985 --> 49:52.161
All the windows and doors are
boarded up or frozen shut.

49:53.162 --> 49:55.037
The footage on the memory
card should tell you

49:55.061 --> 49:57.246
everything that
you need to know.

49:57.270 --> 49:59.006
I've recorded everything
that I could.

49:59.030 --> 50:00.100
I mean, it,

50:01.101 --> 50:04.494
it's almost as if this thing
is trying to show off.

50:04.518 --> 50:08.533
I have never seen
anything this intense.

50:08.557 --> 50:10.524
- No one has.

50:19.602 --> 50:22.536
I think it's a ballroom.
- Let's go.

50:30.579 --> 50:31.694
Of course, no windows.

50:31.718 --> 50:33.282
We, we must be underground.

50:33.306 --> 50:36.561
- Come on, over there.

50:36.585 --> 50:40.796
I've studied footage from
hundreds of haunted locations.

50:41.245 --> 50:45.087
For the most part they just
let the cameras roll for days

50:45.111 --> 50:47.537
and if they're lucky,

50:47.561 --> 50:51.324
they might see a, a
marble move half an inch,

50:52.221 --> 50:53.221
but you,

50:54.741 --> 50:56.581
what you've recorded is,

50:56.605 --> 50:59.480
is nothing short of phenomenal.

50:59.504 --> 51:01.724
When we get out of here,

51:01.748 --> 51:03.864
can you imagine what
this is gonna be worth?

51:03.888 --> 51:06.936
- Yeah, well, if, if
we get out of here.

51:06.960 --> 51:08.455
Daniel, when we met last night,

51:08.479 --> 51:10.457
you said you'd heard a voice.

51:10.481 --> 51:12.183
- What?

51:12.207 --> 51:14.288
Yeah, you, you told me
that you'd heard a voice

51:14.312 --> 51:16.325
in your hotel room.

51:16.349 --> 51:18.454
We never talked about it.

51:19.455 --> 51:23.297
- Right, yeah, yeah,
it said, "it's time",

51:23.321 --> 51:25.241
but it-, I mean, it was,
it was probably nothing.

51:25.265 --> 51:27.612
It was just, I mean, it
was probably the TV.

51:27.636 --> 51:30.166
It, it, look it was nothing.
- Huh.

51:30.190 --> 51:32.399
- Guys, come on.

51:44.998 --> 51:46.172
This is crazy.

51:57.700 --> 51:58.701
Ugh!

52:01.877 --> 52:06.088
- Guys, what is that?

52:06.778 --> 52:08.953
I hear, I hear music
or something.

52:09.298 --> 52:11.024
- Shh, shh.

52:12.853 --> 52:15.201
It's coming from upstairs.

52:16.271 --> 52:18.100
- Slowly.
- Seriously?

52:30.216 --> 52:32.884
There's a landing
here and a door.

52:32.908 --> 52:35.186
Okay, let's check it out.

52:37.188 --> 52:38.258
Quietly.

53:02.731 --> 53:04.605
What do we do?

53:04.629 --> 53:06.883
Well, we see what it is.

53:06.907 --> 53:09.921
Maybe it's nothing,
just a recording.

53:35.453 --> 53:37.293
Take a seat anywhere.

53:37.317 --> 53:39.053
We need help.

53:39.077 --> 53:40.952
We were with the film
crew filming the movie

53:40.976 --> 53:42.402
and people got hurt.

53:42.426 --> 53:43.541
We need to call the police.

53:43.565 --> 53:44.818
We already did.

53:44.842 --> 53:46.992
Emergency crew is on their way.

53:47.016 --> 53:48.649
Some of your friends are here

53:48.673 --> 53:51.100
recovering with a
good stiff drink.

53:51.124 --> 53:53.206
You should join them.

53:53.230 --> 53:54.828
How do we get out of here?

53:54.852 --> 53:57.900
Well, the way you came, I
suppose, the elevator?

53:57.924 --> 54:01.962
It's not working. So
stay, join your friends.

54:11.040 --> 54:12.904
- Oh, my god.

54:13.733 --> 54:17.885
Casper... you're okay.

54:17.909 --> 54:21.303
Stop filming me.
- We thought you died.

54:21.327 --> 54:25.168
I mean it.

54:25.192 --> 54:28.655
I don't need this showing
up in the tabloids.

54:28.679 --> 54:30.519
- This is amazing.

54:30.543 --> 54:32.314
I mean, you survived
a horrible accident.

54:32.338 --> 54:33.280
- Daniel, let's get out of here.

54:33.304 --> 54:35.099
- It's okay.

54:36.583 --> 54:38.596
How's this for a money shot?

54:38.620 --> 54:40.874
- It's phenomenal.
- Stop filming.

54:40.898 --> 54:43.773
- It's okay, it's okay.
- You're not listening.

54:45.937 --> 54:48.261
- Daniel, let's go now.

54:48.285 --> 54:50.285
- This is not real,
none of this is real.

54:50.309 --> 54:50.918
We need to go.

54:50.942 --> 54:53.335
- Okay, okay, okay,
let's go, let's go.

55:06.199 --> 55:07.314
Down here.

55:07.338 --> 55:09.696
Sidney, what do we do if
those things come after us?

55:09.720 --> 55:11.584
Sidney, please.

55:13.724 --> 55:14.942
Wait.

55:14.966 --> 55:16.116
Sidney.

55:16.140 --> 55:17.659
Sidney, just wait.

55:19.074 --> 55:20.362
There is nowhere left to run.

55:20.386 --> 55:22.812
Then why don't you just
go back to the bar?

55:22.836 --> 55:24.780
Order a cosmo, tip
the piano player.

55:24.804 --> 55:26.920
Maybe he'll play your
favorite tune for you.

55:26.944 --> 55:28.944
Don't be an asshole.
- Look, it's not safe

55:28.968 --> 55:30.095
just standing in open.

55:31.431 --> 55:33.823
Oh my god, the walls.
- Oh my god, that smell.

55:33.847 --> 55:35.273
Guys, go, go, go!

55:35.297 --> 55:36.274
- Run!

55:36.298 --> 55:38.828
- Oh god.
- Jesus Christ.

55:38.852 --> 55:41.383
- Daniel, there's an exit.

55:47.274 --> 55:49.394
- There should be a door
on the next landing.

55:49.418 --> 55:50.454
- Okay, yes.

55:54.178 --> 55:55.213
It's locked.

55:58.285 --> 55:59.470
- Oh.
- Whoa, whoa.

55:59.494 --> 56:02.220
- Everyone stop.
- Hold on, hold on.

56:02.842 --> 56:04.050
- Okay.
- Okay.

56:05.812 --> 56:07.132
- I switched over
to night vision.

56:07.156 --> 56:08.030
Am I good, Daniel?

56:08.054 --> 56:08.927
Am I good here? - You're okay.

56:08.951 --> 56:09.894
There's nothing in front of you.

56:09.918 --> 56:11.598
Just take it slow.
- We need to keep going.

56:11.622 --> 56:13.380
He's just playing with us.
- Okay.

56:15.613 --> 56:18.696
Down and...

56:18.720 --> 56:20.249
In the front.

56:20.273 --> 56:22.285
- I see you, I see you.

56:22.309 --> 56:23.217
- Okay.
- You're okay.

56:23.241 --> 56:24.149
- Keep going.
- Okay, okay.

56:24.173 --> 56:26.762
Kill her.

56:28.385 --> 56:29.431
- What was that?

56:29.455 --> 56:30.775
- What?
- What?

56:32.112 --> 56:35.575
- That voice.
- I didn't hear any voice.

56:35.599 --> 56:38.474
What did, what did it say?

56:38.498 --> 56:41.581
- Nothing, just keep going.

56:41.605 --> 56:43.617
Jesus Christ!

56:43.641 --> 56:44.515
- What?
- Oh!

56:44.539 --> 56:45.579
- What happened?
- Vanessa!

56:45.603 --> 56:46.448
- What happened?

56:46.472 --> 56:47.518
- Vanessa.
- What happened?

56:47.542 --> 56:49.002
Oh god, something pushed me.

56:49.026 --> 56:50.383
- Hold on.
- Oh, oh, god.

56:50.407 --> 56:52.527
- Oh, Jesus, your leg.
- I think it's broken.

56:52.551 --> 56:54.387
- Oh, my god.
- Just, sweetheart, listen...

57:00.635 --> 57:01.635
Guys this door is open.

57:01.659 --> 57:03.050
We gotta get out
of this stairwell.

57:04.835 --> 57:06.675
- Like four or five flights.

57:06.699 --> 57:10.161
- We shot on the fifth floor.
- Put your weight on me.

57:10.185 --> 57:12.185
- I'm gonna get you up, -
I'm gonna help you, okay?

57:12.209 --> 57:13.613
- Give me your hand.
- Up.

57:13.637 --> 57:15.028
There we go.

57:15.052 --> 57:15.856
- Okay, you're okay.
- Okay.

57:15.880 --> 57:16.823
- You're okay.
- Put your weight

57:16.847 --> 57:18.134
on your other leg. - I got you.

57:18.158 --> 57:19.412
- Come on.
- I got you.

57:19.436 --> 57:20.482
Hold on, hold on.

57:20.506 --> 57:21.906
- Vanessa, you're
okay, you're okay.

57:21.930 --> 57:23.450
- Hold on.
- I don't wanna die.

57:23.474 --> 57:25.165
- Ah, okay.

57:26.443 --> 57:27.696
- Okay.

57:27.720 --> 57:30.526
- Let's go through those doors.

57:30.550 --> 57:32.286
Oh, come on guys.

57:32.310 --> 57:35.082
This is just, this is
just slowing us down.

57:35.106 --> 57:35.911
Okay.

57:35.935 --> 57:37.119
Why don't you just go

57:37.143 --> 57:41.157
and see if there's a way
out through those doors.

57:41.181 --> 57:43.505
Ah!

57:43.529 --> 57:44.989
She's right.

57:45.013 --> 57:47.578
I'll be quick, it might
just be a dead end.

57:47.602 --> 57:49.683
You stay here with her.

57:49.707 --> 57:53.376
Why don't you put her
in that wheelchair?

57:53.400 --> 57:55.092
- Oh, shit.

58:01.098 --> 58:02.696
Okay. Easy, easy, easy.

58:05.516 --> 58:06.690
Oh, oh, ooh.

58:07.725 --> 58:08.725
Oh.

58:13.317 --> 58:14.317
Here.

58:15.158 --> 58:16.158
What is this?

58:16.182 --> 58:19.230
St. Benedict of nursia
for protection.

58:19.254 --> 58:21.853
Tell you the truth, it's never
really done me much good.

58:23.672 --> 58:26.882
Maybe you'll have
better luck with it.

58:33.855 --> 58:35.719
Hey, Sidney, Sidney.

58:36.892 --> 58:38.066
Be careful.

58:45.556 --> 58:48.328
You see anything, Sidney?

58:48.352 --> 58:49.916
- Sidney?

58:49.940 --> 58:54.058
Oh god, Daniel, this is
unbearable, I might pass out.

58:54.082 --> 58:57.199
I know it hurts like hell.

58:57.223 --> 58:58.752
Hang in there, okay?

58:58.776 --> 58:59.581
Hang in there.

58:59.605 --> 59:00.443
Oh, shit.

59:00.467 --> 59:01.444
- Oh.
- Shit.

59:01.468 --> 59:03.481
Oh, please. - It's okay.

59:03.505 --> 59:05.545
Get me out of here.
- It's okay, it's okay.

59:05.569 --> 59:07.761
No, it's not okay.
- It's okay, it's okay.

59:07.785 --> 59:10.730
It's really not okay.
- It's okay.

59:15.931 --> 59:18.313
- Sid, is that you?

59:20.211 --> 59:24.422
♪ - Oh Danny boy the pipes
the pipes are calling ♪

59:25.147 --> 59:26.608
- Let me get the camera.

59:26.632 --> 59:30.808
♪ If I am dead, as
dead I well may be ♪

59:32.741 --> 59:35.582
♪ You'll come and find

59:35.606 --> 59:39.403
♪ the place where I am lying

59:40.853 --> 59:45.064
♪ and kneel and say
an ave there for me ♪

59:48.585 --> 59:50.000
It's you, Daniel.

59:51.795 --> 59:53.831
You're the one he wants.

59:56.523 --> 59:59.433
W- where did he go?
- He was standing right here.

59:59.457 --> 01:00:01.366
He was literally
standing right here.

01:00:01.390 --> 01:00:04.014
We have, we have to find him.

01:00:04.808 --> 01:00:06.672
- Okay, okay.

01:00:10.227 --> 01:00:12.481
Oh my god, Sidney?

01:00:16.198 --> 01:00:17.821
- Sidney?

01:00:19.408 --> 01:00:22.836
You know, that thing was right.

01:00:22.860 --> 01:00:25.011
It said I'd lost my faith,

01:00:25.035 --> 01:00:29.246
that I was as empty as those
vapid talk shows I appear on.

01:00:31.904 --> 01:00:32.904
I sold out.

01:00:34.113 --> 01:00:37.886
I got too comfortable
and I lost my faith.

01:00:37.910 --> 01:00:41.258
And that's why I
couldn't expel it.

01:00:41.707 --> 01:00:45.849
Now, look at me,
just lying there.

01:00:48.058 --> 01:00:50.105
- You're losing it, buddy.

01:00:50.129 --> 01:00:51.889
What are you talking about?

01:00:52.338 --> 01:00:55.306
Come, take a look for yourself.

01:01:06.490 --> 01:01:10.125
- Oh, my god, Vanessa, go.

01:01:10.149 --> 01:01:10.953
Get out!

01:01:10.977 --> 01:01:11.782
Go!

01:01:11.806 --> 01:01:12.714
Oh!

01:01:12.738 --> 01:01:14.301
- No, no, no, no.
- Shit.

01:01:14.325 --> 01:01:16.269
- No, no.
- Oh fuck.

01:01:16.293 --> 01:01:19.686
Oh, oh. - It won't open.

01:01:19.710 --> 01:01:21.550
- Move, move, move!

01:01:21.574 --> 01:01:24.104
Fucking come on!

01:01:24.128 --> 01:01:26.175
You just got here, Daniel.

01:01:26.199 --> 01:01:28.695
Why do you leave so soon?

01:01:28.719 --> 01:01:31.318
We have so much to talk about?

01:01:31.342 --> 01:01:33.320
We've got nothing
to talk about, man.

01:01:33.344 --> 01:01:34.691
Let us go.

01:01:35.139 --> 01:01:37.531
W-, who are you talking to?

01:01:37.555 --> 01:01:38.835
The voice, you're
not hearing it?

01:01:38.859 --> 01:01:42.122
Ah, no, I don't hear anything.

01:01:42.146 --> 01:01:44.918
A deal's a deal, Daniel.

01:01:44.942 --> 01:01:45.942
It's time.

01:01:46.944 --> 01:01:48.424
Why did those people
have to die, man?

01:01:48.448 --> 01:01:50.047
You never said
anything about that.

01:01:50.071 --> 01:01:51.718
Oh, please.

01:01:51.742 --> 01:01:53.582
That was just a little fun.

01:01:53.606 --> 01:01:55.826
They all had families,
lives, careers.

01:01:55.850 --> 01:01:57.310
Man, Aaron had a family

01:01:57.334 --> 01:01:59.519
and you snuffed
them out like bugs.

01:01:59.543 --> 01:02:00.589
W- what's wrong, Daniel?

01:02:00.613 --> 01:02:03.178
This is insane, who
are you talking to?

01:02:03.202 --> 01:02:05.894
Tell her, Daniel, or shall I?

01:02:11.762 --> 01:02:12.762
So be it.

01:02:15.076 --> 01:02:16.191
- Okay, okay!

01:02:16.215 --> 01:02:17.088
Okay!

01:02:17.112 --> 01:02:18.262
I'll tell her.

01:02:18.286 --> 01:02:19.642
Tell me what?

01:02:19.666 --> 01:02:23.843
- This whole thing is my fault.

01:02:24.844 --> 01:02:26.235
I think it's because of me.

01:02:26.259 --> 01:02:28.617
Oh, how is this your fault?

01:02:28.641 --> 01:02:31.102
- I, uh...

01:02:31.126 --> 01:02:33.760
- What, Daniel, what?
- I made a deal.

01:02:33.784 --> 01:02:36.235
What do you mean a, a deal?

01:02:37.684 --> 01:02:40.456
I wanted, I wanted a
meaningful career.

01:02:40.480 --> 01:02:41.837
I wanted the work
and the success

01:02:41.861 --> 01:02:44.277
that I saw others
getting and so I,

01:02:46.590 --> 01:02:48.281
I summoned something...

01:02:50.214 --> 01:02:51.491
Dark.

01:02:55.392 --> 01:02:56.872
I didn't think it
would actually work,

01:02:56.896 --> 01:02:57.873
but I figured why not
just give it a try?

01:02:57.897 --> 01:03:00.166
I mean, nothing
else was working.

01:03:00.190 --> 01:03:02.962
And I just needed a break, but
i, I didn't think it would,

01:03:02.986 --> 01:03:04.266
I didn't think
this would happen.

01:03:04.290 --> 01:03:05.850
I, I didn't think
people were gonna die.

01:03:05.874 --> 01:03:09.037
- You sold your soul
to the devil for,

01:03:09.061 --> 01:03:11.028
for what, Daniel, fame?

01:03:12.512 --> 01:03:14.836
I just wanted to be
a great filmmaker.

01:03:14.860 --> 01:03:17.045
All that footage you shot.

01:03:17.069 --> 01:03:20.565
You captured all those things
that actually happened.

01:03:20.589 --> 01:03:22.153
Yeah, lucky me.

01:03:22.177 --> 01:03:24.811
I get to be known as the guy
that captured the paranormal

01:03:24.835 --> 01:03:28.159
and proves to everybody
that it fucking exists!

01:03:28.183 --> 01:03:31.853
Quite clever, am I right?

01:03:31.877 --> 01:03:34.510
No, this isn't
what we agreed on!

01:03:34.534 --> 01:03:38.135
That's not your decision.

01:03:38.159 --> 01:03:39.999
When you summoned me,

01:03:40.023 --> 01:03:44.234
we never discussed what
you'd become famous for.

01:03:44.821 --> 01:03:48.997
And now, I've gifted you with
something extraordinary.

01:03:50.827 --> 01:03:55.003
Look, you got what
you wanted, man.

01:03:55.970 --> 01:03:59.421
My soul is yours.

01:04:00.008 --> 01:04:01.227
Let Vanessa go.

01:04:01.251 --> 01:04:02.469
- No.
- Yes.

01:04:02.493 --> 01:04:04.851
I told you back then
I would someday

01:04:04.875 --> 01:04:06.542
need you to give me
something in return.

01:04:06.566 --> 01:04:08.303
What do you want?

01:04:08.327 --> 01:04:10.363
Take a life.

01:04:10.812 --> 01:04:11.812
What?

01:04:13.435 --> 01:04:14.619
No, i...

01:04:14.643 --> 01:04:17.795
Then I will extinguish
you and your

01:04:17.819 --> 01:04:20.315
friend and move on to
the next needy soul.

01:04:20.339 --> 01:04:22.421
- This is crazy, man.
- [Ominous

01:04:22.445 --> 01:04:24.550
[voiceover] This is
business, Daniel.

01:04:24.930 --> 01:04:27.322
I can't, I can't
fucking kill someone.

01:04:27.346 --> 01:04:29.186
I can't kill someone, man.

01:04:33.731 --> 01:04:35.640
You've already killed.

01:04:35.664 --> 01:04:37.815
You are directly
responsible for the deaths

01:04:37.839 --> 01:04:40.531
of all those poor souls earlier.

01:04:41.636 --> 01:04:42.982
What's one more?

01:04:48.850 --> 01:04:52.416
- She doesn't deserve this.
- Daniel, please.

01:04:52.440 --> 01:04:56.247
I'd recommend a clean
slice across the throat.

01:04:56.271 --> 01:04:59.457
Severing the jugular
bisecting the airway

01:04:59.481 --> 01:05:01.483
would be the most rapid.

01:05:03.244 --> 01:05:05.153
Oh, god, please!

01:05:05.177 --> 01:05:07.731
Oh, please let me out, please.

01:05:10.354 --> 01:05:12.643
I'm gonna put an end to your
fucking game right now.

01:05:12.667 --> 01:05:15.888
Daniel, you disappoint.

01:05:15.912 --> 01:05:17.983
Let her go, let her go!

01:05:21.020 --> 01:05:23.033
Oh, oh, oh god.

01:05:23.057 --> 01:05:24.161
There, there.

01:05:26.888 --> 01:05:28.038
Over there.

01:05:28.062 --> 01:05:29.177
Vanessa.

01:05:29.201 --> 01:05:32.421
No, we cannot stop now, Daniel.

01:05:32.445 --> 01:05:34.113
We have come too far.

01:05:34.137 --> 01:05:35.932
I am gonna fight.

01:05:36.691 --> 01:05:39.487
I still have fight
in me, do you?

01:05:50.153 --> 01:05:52.786
You see anything?
- I don't, I don't know.

01:05:52.810 --> 01:05:56.618
I mean, there's gotta
be a door back there.

01:05:56.642 --> 01:05:57.515
Oh god, Daniel.

01:05:57.539 --> 01:06:00.853
Enough with damn camera.
- Just leave it.

01:06:06.893 --> 01:06:07.998
Okay, okay.

01:06:09.620 --> 01:06:11.139
What's over there?

01:06:12.589 --> 01:06:14.049
I don't know.

01:06:18.215 --> 01:06:20.953
My Patience is waning, Daniel.

01:06:20.977 --> 01:06:24.049
- Is, is he here?
- He's here alright.

01:06:25.947 --> 01:06:27.627
I shall count to three,

01:06:27.651 --> 01:06:31.862
and then both of you drop
dead like all the others,

01:06:33.058 --> 01:06:35.622
or you can live the
rest of your life

01:06:35.646 --> 01:06:38.995
in the light of
glorious darkness.

01:06:42.274 --> 01:06:44.276
Give me another choice.

01:06:44.793 --> 01:06:46.633
You made your choice.

01:06:46.657 --> 01:06:49.912
You summoned me of
your own free will.

01:06:49.936 --> 01:06:52.639
You, you, have to
believe, Daniel.

01:06:52.663 --> 01:06:54.089
Please don't give up, please.

01:06:54.113 --> 01:06:55.433
- Okay.
- One.

01:06:55.457 --> 01:06:58.991
Oh, god and father of
our lord, Jesus Christ.

01:06:59.015 --> 01:07:01.614
- Two.
- I appeal to thy holy name.

01:07:01.638 --> 01:07:03.961
Three.

01:07:03.985 --> 01:07:06.446
I'm humbly begging
your kindness, please.

01:07:10.888 --> 01:07:12.476
No, oh, oh, oh, no.

01:07:16.825 --> 01:07:18.320
I don't wanna die,
I don't wanna die.

01:07:18.344 --> 01:07:21.047
Please, please, oh please, argh!

01:07:21.071 --> 01:07:23.394
Vanessa, stop fighting, please.

01:07:23.418 --> 01:07:27.157
Oh, please.

01:07:27.181 --> 01:07:28.320
Ugh!

01:07:33.221 --> 01:07:34.221
Ugh!

01:07:39.745 --> 01:07:40.745
Ugh!

01:07:47.132 --> 01:07:51.170
Oh, Daniel, Daniel, Daniel.

01:07:56.762 --> 01:08:00.938
I must ask, was it really
worth all that fuss?

01:08:04.563 --> 01:08:05.702
I hate you.

01:08:08.187 --> 01:08:09.809
I fucking hate you.

01:08:11.190 --> 01:08:12.190
Ugh.

01:08:20.211 --> 01:08:21.211
Huh.

01:08:21.234 --> 01:08:24.444
That is what I call
keeping it real.

01:08:26.343 --> 01:08:27.631
Surprised?

01:08:27.654 --> 01:08:30.772
Ha ha ha ha ha,
you shouldn't be.

01:08:30.796 --> 01:08:32.567
Most heinous atrocities
are always committed

01:08:32.591 --> 01:08:35.017
by the most banal of men,

01:08:35.041 --> 01:08:39.115
dictators, zealots, politicians.

01:08:39.874 --> 01:08:43.819
The extraordinary thing is,
no one ever sees me coming.

01:08:43.843 --> 01:08:45.718
Oh, come on, Daniel, cheer up.

01:08:45.742 --> 01:08:48.997
Look, you got it all on camera.

01:08:49.020 --> 01:08:51.586
Although, I might
edit this last part

01:08:51.609 --> 01:08:54.451
a little bit if I were you,

01:08:54.475 --> 01:08:57.350
but after that, you are going
to be the first person

01:08:57.374 --> 01:09:01.585
to show an increasingly
secular, cynical world

01:09:01.792 --> 01:09:04.243
absolute, irrefutable proof

01:09:04.968 --> 01:09:07.902
of the existence
of a higher power.

01:09:11.250 --> 01:09:12.250
Me.

01:09:16.531 --> 01:09:18.578
Some have said this is
the first time ever

01:09:18.602 --> 01:09:20.408
that real indisputable evidence

01:09:20.432 --> 01:09:23.504
has ever been recorded
of something,

01:09:24.090 --> 01:09:25.437
beyond the veil,

01:09:27.749 --> 01:09:28.854
paranormal.

01:09:30.234 --> 01:09:33.247
Um, a whole new religious
order has awoken

01:09:33.272 --> 01:09:34.308
for some who

01:09:36.206 --> 01:09:40.383
believe this to be unquestionable
proof of life after death.

01:09:43.386 --> 01:09:47.596
And then, there's some that
think I faked the whole thing.

01:09:49.392 --> 01:09:51.112
I guess that's for each
and every one of you

01:09:51.136 --> 01:09:53.276
to decide for yourselves.

01:09:55.363 --> 01:09:56.571
This happened,

01:09:59.574 --> 01:10:00.574
to me,

01:10:03.095 --> 01:10:04.095
to them,

01:10:06.719 --> 01:10:07.789
all of us.

01:10:11.068 --> 01:10:14.151
Look, I can't explain
it, and I'm not even

01:10:14.175 --> 01:10:17.454
gonna begin to try
and understand it.

01:10:18.041 --> 01:10:20.630
What you're about to see is...

01:10:21.562 --> 01:10:22.562
Real.

01:10:28.085 --> 01:10:29.960
Let's roll the film.

01:10:33.159 --> 01:10:34.644
- Thank you, Daniel.

01:10:56.113 --> 01:10:59.841
Oh, come on, man, get the
camera out of my face.

01:11:01.809 --> 01:11:03.442
That's enough.
