 "The second I saw you,

00:49.375 --> 00:53.583
...punched a hole in my chest
and grabbed my heart with your fist.

00:53.583 --> 00:56.666
Every word, every glance from you

00:56.666 --> 01:00.250
squeezed my heart
and pumped blood through my veins

01:00.250 --> 01:02.875
and gave me life.

01:02.875 --> 01:06.916
I mean, sometimes, it actually hurts
to look at you because I just get all sad

01:06.916 --> 01:09.458
about the moments I was alive
before we met.

01:09.958 --> 01:11.666
Was there a time before we met?

01:12.375 --> 01:14.083
Fuck that!

01:14.083 --> 01:15.750
That asshole piece of shit,

01:15.750 --> 01:18.500
making me fall in love with him
and his stupid fuckin' extra dicks.

01:18.500 --> 01:21.916
Rochelle, um...
I, uh... I need to talk to you.

01:21.916 --> 01:25.125
I don't wanna talk, but I've got some hate
I wanna fuck out. Let's go.

01:25.125 --> 01:29.208
Oh, uh... [chuckles] Actually,
that's what I came to talk to you about.

01:29.208 --> 01:30.958
I can't keep doing hate-sex.

01:30.958 --> 01:32.833
- What?
- I need something more.

01:32.833 --> 01:35.041
Oh, shit, you're finally gonna let me
peg your ass?

01:35.041 --> 01:36.500
No, not that.

01:36.500 --> 01:38.833
I want us to have a real relationship.

01:38.833 --> 01:41.208
Jesus, Pete, I already told you.

01:41.208 --> 01:43.875
Hate Worms don't fuck with
that lovey-dovey bullshit.

01:43.875 --> 01:45.875
But, Rochelle...

01:45.875 --> 01:49.166
...you are the most amazing creature
I've ever met.

01:49.166 --> 01:50.875
- You're smart and talented--
- Pete--

01:50.875 --> 01:53.208
And so funny,
even when it's at my expense.

01:53.208 --> 01:57.500
- What are you trying to say exactly?
- I guess I'm trying to say that I...

01:58.625 --> 02:00.250
- I love you, Rochelle.
- What?

02:00.250 --> 02:02.583
Yeah. [chuckles] I love you.

02:02.583 --> 02:05.208
- I. Love. You.
- Oh.

02:05.208 --> 02:07.333
I've been wanting to say it
for a long time,

02:07.333 --> 02:09.916
and I gotta tell you,
it feels really good on my lips.

02:09.916 --> 02:12.833
Pete, look at me.
I'm not in a very loving place right now.

02:12.833 --> 02:15.750
But you know
you're not a Hate Worm, not really.

02:15.750 --> 02:20.583
You're a Lovebug. You're great at love.
It's what you were made for.

02:20.583 --> 02:23.166
So do love, please.

02:23.166 --> 02:24.875
Oh, Pete, I don't know.

02:24.875 --> 02:28.666
Typical. A man telling you who you are.

02:28.666 --> 02:30.166
Oh, no, no, no. I-- I wasn't--

02:30.166 --> 02:32.083
I am not speaking to you, Rock.

02:32.083 --> 02:34.583
General Malice, what--
What are you doing here?

02:34.583 --> 02:37.041
I am here for you, Rochelle Hillhurst.

02:37.041 --> 02:39.833
- Oh, um... Okay?
- Conference room.

02:39.833 --> 02:44.208
All right, I guess we'll, uh, just, uh,
finish our conversation later then? Heh.

02:44.208 --> 02:46.916
I'll just leave my naked heart
on your desk.

02:46.916 --> 02:49.500
What the hell's General Malice doing here?

02:49.500 --> 02:52.375
I don't know. She came for Rochelle.

02:52.375 --> 02:54.625
That maniac's the head
of the Hate Division.

02:54.625 --> 02:58.000
She's the reason monkeys
started throwing shit at each other.

02:58.000 --> 02:59.166
Brr.

02:59.166 --> 03:02.791
It's freezing in here, no?
We are cold-blooded, you and I.

03:02.791 --> 03:05.583
Uh, what can I do for you, General Malice?

03:05.583 --> 03:08.000
Oh, getting right to the point.

03:08.000 --> 03:10.083
- No foreplay.
- Right.

03:10.083 --> 03:13.166
I've been watching you,
Rochelle Hillhurst.

03:13.166 --> 03:15.166
- You remind me of myself.
- Really?

03:15.166 --> 03:18.833
Yes. I used to be
one of these cockroaches of love.

03:18.833 --> 03:21.750
- You were a Lovebug?
- Ugh, yes.

03:21.750 --> 03:26.208
I was at the mercy
of "feelings" and "kissing."

03:26.208 --> 03:28.291
Love almost broke me.

03:28.291 --> 03:32.875
I was crying in the daytime,
saying, "Oh, poor me, bo-bo-bo."

03:32.875 --> 03:36.541
And then I said, "No!
I will never be heartbroken again."

03:36.541 --> 03:40.500
- And now I do the heartbreaking.
- I like the sound of that.

03:40.500 --> 03:42.875
Hate is simple. Hate is power.

03:42.875 --> 03:46.291
Hate... <i>Come si dice?</i> Gets the shit done.

03:46.291 --> 03:48.500
So, what do you want from me?

03:48.500 --> 03:52.000
Come to the Hate Department,
work by my side,

03:52.000 --> 03:54.416
and you will never be hurt again.

03:54.416 --> 03:56.000
You mean, like, full-time?

03:56.000 --> 03:58.875
You have a powerful hate inside you, Rochelle.

03:58.875 --> 04:02.041
Think about who you are
and who you want to be.

04:02.041 --> 04:04.541
And then you let me know, okay?

04:06.125 --> 04:11.041

You were right. This is who I am.

05:58.875 --> 06:00.458
Does that also mean you choose...

06:00.458 --> 06:03.291
You, yes. I choose you.

I thought that lizard lady was gonna
recruit you to hate or something.

06:24.500 --> 06:28.500

06:40.375 --> 06:43.333
What?! No! No! You-- You can't do that.

06:43.333 --> 06:45.083
- Excuse me?
- You're a Lovebug.

06:45.083 --> 06:48.458
- Don't tell me who I am.
- Oh! No, no, I would never. I was just--

06:48.458 --> 06:50.791
Pete, do I look like
a shit-covered little baby?

06:50.791 --> 06:52.166
What? No, of course not.

06:52.166 --> 06:55.666
- Then why are you trying to change me?
- What? No, no, I'm not.

06:55.666 --> 06:58.500
It's just that, you know,
if you're a Hate Worm...

06:59.416 --> 07:00.958
...I can't do this anymore.

07:00.958 --> 07:03.416
You think I give a shit?
I don't. We're done.

07:03.416 --> 07:05.833
Wha-- What?
No. You don't mean that.

07:05.833 --> 07:08.166
I do. Now get the fuck outta my way.

07:08.166 --> 07:09.458
Rochelle.

07:09.458 --> 07:13.500
I wish there was a universe
in which you could love me.

07:14.791 --> 07:16.916
Ooh, it looks like there is.

07:16.916 --> 07:19.500
But there's a different Pete
in this timeline.

07:19.500 --> 07:21.833
Ooh, and he seems much happier.

07:21.833 --> 07:23.666
Oh, I'm so happy!

07:28.375 --> 07:29.375
Hey, Alice.

07:29.375 --> 07:34.125
Ah, jeez. I hate that I'm still bummed out
about that terrible date.

07:34.125 --> 07:37.916
Forget that loser Shawn.
What you need is a little self-love.

07:37.916 --> 07:40.625
Oh, you're talking about downtown time.

07:40.625 --> 07:44.791
I actually meant a massage,
but that sounds like an afternoon.

07:44.791 --> 07:45.958
Man, fuck Shawn.

07:45.958 --> 07:49.375
Let's see if there's an app that
lets you mail dog shit to someone's house.

07:49.375 --> 07:50.750
If not, let's invent one.

07:50.750 --> 07:52.458
Ugh!

07:52.458 --> 07:55.875
- It's my landlord's friends.
- Girl, you give out your email too much.

07:56.416 --> 07:59.750
<i>Hi, Alice. Oh my God,
thank you so much for talking to us.</i>

07:59.750 --> 08:01.708
<i>- This is Sal.</i>
- Hey, Sal.

08:01.708 --> 08:03.375
Oh, I like your hat.

08:03.375 --> 08:05.083
That is a cute motherfucker.

08:05.083 --> 08:08.041
<i>His school is trying to move him
and the other disabled kids</i>

08:08.041 --> 08:10.708
<i>into a "separate but equal" class.</i>

08:10.708 --> 08:12.958
- Oh, hell to the no no.
- Fuck that.

08:12.958 --> 08:14.791
<i>-
- Sal, no, please. Mommy's talking.</i>

08:14.791 --> 08:16.166
<i>We already called the principal--</i>

08:16.166 --> 08:18.166
Did you wish upon a fuckin' star too?

08:18.166 --> 08:22.250
The world is trash. People only respond
to shame and physical violence.

08:22.250 --> 08:24.125
And stay down, bitch.

08:24.125 --> 08:25.666
<i>So, will you help us?</i>

08:25.666 --> 08:28.000
You know I hate this ableist bullshit.

08:28.000 --> 08:29.833
It's fuckery of the highest order.

08:29.833 --> 08:32.875
Ladies, let's fuck some shit up.

08:32.875 --> 08:34.333
<i>- Yes, let's do this.
- Thank you.</i>

08:34.333 --> 08:38.041
You hear that, cute motherfucker?
We gon' burn your school to the ground.

08:39.500 --> 08:42.875
- Did that kid just grunt and hang up?
- Respect.

08:44.333 --> 08:46.083
What do you mean,
you're out of chicken salad?

08:46.083 --> 08:48.750
- Um, I can check the back.
- I got a better idea.

08:48.750 --> 08:51.583
Why don't you take
a big, fat shit in your hand and eat it?

08:51.583 --> 08:53.333
Connie, I have an important question

08:53.333 --> 08:57.416
that will have no real-world consequences
based on your response,

08:57.416 --> 08:59.000
but... do I look fat to you?

08:59.000 --> 09:01.666
- Maury, this feels like a trap.
- Oh, no, no, no.

09:01.666 --> 09:03.833
I just still haven't lost
all the baby weight,

09:03.833 --> 09:07.583
and I feel like a...
big garbage truck full of shit.

09:07.583 --> 09:09.416
- Your words, not mine.
- Ooh!

09:09.416 --> 09:13.333
- The special is the Two-Day Burrito.
- Didn't you just say you're feelin' fat?

09:13.333 --> 09:16.041
I know, but listen.
It sounds so delicious.

09:16.041 --> 09:20.500
"This soggy-bottomed monstrosity
is our take on a sleeping bag

09:20.500 --> 09:23.750
stuffed with ground beef,
pork, beans, and bacon."

09:23.750 --> 09:27.916
"So big, it's meant to be eaten
over two days."

09:27.916 --> 09:30.208
Maury, please don't put that in your body.

09:30.208 --> 09:33.458
So, what, you think I should get
something healthy?

09:33.458 --> 09:36.500
Healthy? Who gives a shit.
We all gonna fuckin' die anyway.

09:36.500 --> 09:38.291
Oh, well, she makes an excellent point.

09:38.291 --> 09:39.916
Gimme that death burrito.

09:39.916 --> 09:44.500
Oh, come on, Rochelle. He does not need
30 pounds of meat up in his guts.

09:44.500 --> 09:47.041
Do I look like his goddamn nutritionist?
I don't give a fuck.

09:47.041 --> 09:49.416
God, I miss Lovebug Rochelle.

09:49.416 --> 09:51.708
She would have been much less of a bitch.

09:53.000 --> 09:55.458
Maury, tell me you're not getting
that Two-Day Burrito.

09:55.458 --> 09:58.541
Your body's a temple.
Get yourself something healthy, honey.

09:58.541 --> 10:00.375
Yes, thank you, Rochelle.

10:00.375 --> 10:02.708
I shall take one gar...

10:03.250 --> 10:05.208
- Garden salad.
- Aw.

10:05.208 --> 10:08.541
Now, this Rochelle,
she's a goddamn delight.

10:08.541 --> 10:11.791
Ooh, look at you, all Lovebuggy.

10:11.791 --> 10:14.666
What happened? Did you miss having arms?

10:14.666 --> 10:17.583
- Pete happened.
- I, uh, got you a cookie, Rochelle.

10:17.583 --> 10:19.750
- Aw, babe.
-"Babe"?

10:19.750 --> 10:21.791
- Ah!
- What?! You and Pete?

10:21.791 --> 10:24.166
Are you guys, like, together-together now?

10:24.166 --> 10:28.333
We are, and I gotta say, I am so happy.

10:28.333 --> 10:31.958
Me too. I didn't know it was possible
to feel this good.

10:31.958 --> 10:34.041
And I once solved a Rubik's Cube
in a pool.

10:34.041 --> 10:35.666
That's great, um...

10:35.666 --> 10:38.250
I just thought you were pretty
into being a Hate Worm.

10:38.250 --> 10:41.625
Like telling people to shit
in their own hands and eat it, and--

10:41.625 --> 10:44.250
Yes, Emmy, I was getting very specific

10:44.250 --> 10:46.291
about what people should do
with their shit,

10:46.291 --> 10:49.041
but now I choose love,
and it feels really nice.

10:50.250 --> 10:54.250
I just got an email
for a free Olive Garden coupon.

10:54.250 --> 10:56.208
How is that important in any way?

10:56.208 --> 10:58.708
I don't know,
but it feels important, right?

10:58.708 --> 11:00.666
Now, color me impressed, Maury.

11:00.666 --> 11:03.291
I've seen you stick vegetables
up your booty-hole,

11:03.291 --> 11:04.875
but never in your mouth-hole.

11:04.875 --> 11:06.375
I feel invigorated.

11:06.375 --> 11:08.666
And just imagine how shitty I'd be feeling

11:08.666 --> 11:12.333
if I'd ordered
that needlessly huge two-day burrito.

11:12.791 --> 11:15.541
Ugh, fuck me. This thing is way too huge.

11:15.541 --> 11:18.166
How the hell
am I supposed to finish it all in one day?

11:18.166 --> 11:20.625
You're not supposed to.

11:20.625 --> 11:24.208
So I said, "No, no, no, no, no,
hold out your left hand,

11:24.208 --> 11:25.791
and take a shit in that."

11:27.000 --> 11:30.791
Oh, Rochelle, you are the queen
of telling people where to shit.

11:30.791 --> 11:33.000
She loves it over there, doesn't she?

11:33.000 --> 11:36.500
Well, I'm glad she loves something,
'cause she really doesn't love me.

11:36.500 --> 11:38.083
Oh, woof.

11:38.083 --> 11:39.958
Pete, bad color.

11:39.958 --> 11:42.416
I-- I mean, I got iced out
by my crush too,

11:42.416 --> 11:45.583
but you don't see me, like,
embarrassing myself.

11:45.583 --> 11:48.041
- Ooh, there's Van now.
- Van!

11:48.041 --> 11:50.208
Van, over here. I saved you a seat.

11:50.208 --> 11:53.625
You don't have to be upset with me anymore
for whatever it is I did wrong.

11:53.625 --> 11:55.333
Please, please, God, just love me!

11:55.333 --> 11:59.375
Oof, you're right, honey.
You're not embarrassing at all.

11:59.375 --> 12:02.708
- Emmy, is it possible we both just suck?
- It is.

12:02.708 --> 12:06.000
- No way. We're delightful.
- I don't know.

12:06.000 --> 12:07.166
You know what we need?

12:07.166 --> 12:12.000
We need to drink so many vodka tonics,
the bartender gets worried about us.

12:12.000 --> 12:15.583
- I don't want to.
- We gotta get drunk.

12:15.583 --> 12:18.208
Okay, but I'm gonna weep the whole time.

12:18.208 --> 12:20.375
That's fine. That's what bars are for.

12:21.500 --> 12:25.500
I just got an email
for a free Olive Garden coupon.

12:25.500 --> 12:27.458
How is that important in any way?

12:27.458 --> 12:31.083
I don't know, but it must be, right?
'Cause I said it twice?

12:31.083 --> 12:32.666
Disability rights...

12:32.666 --> 12:34.166
...are human rights!

12:34.166 --> 12:35.666
Disability rights...

12:35.666 --> 12:37.375
...are human rights!

12:37.375 --> 12:42.791
This school is trying to hide
its disabled students in the basement.

12:42.791 --> 12:45.541
And that stuff you serve on Fridays
is not pizza.

12:45.541 --> 12:47.250
It's hot ketchup on cardboard.

12:47.250 --> 12:50.958
Ho-ho! Those fuckers on the school board
are gonna cave, I can feel it.

12:50.958 --> 12:52.458
<i>- ♪ Yeah, yeah ♪</i>
- I can feel it, too!

12:52.458 --> 12:53.458
This bitch?

12:53.458 --> 12:54.875
What the fuck are you doing here?

12:54.875 --> 12:57.833
My girl Alice
got all these people to show up?

12:57.833 --> 13:00.041
How could Hope not be here?

13:00.041 --> 13:01.458
Titty bomb!

13:01.458 --> 13:04.083
No. Don't try to take credit for this.

13:04.083 --> 13:07.375
This protest was brought to you
by the letter hate.

13:07.375 --> 13:11.041
Yeah, I can see that.
What happened to you, Rochelle?

13:11.041 --> 13:14.000
I fell for your bullshit,
and I'm not gonna let it happen again.

13:14.000 --> 13:16.125
Alice doesn't need you, so fuck off.

13:16.125 --> 13:18.166
Girl, you know that ain't up to you.

13:18.166 --> 13:22.041
- Alice, this is Dev. He's my brother.
- And our lawyer.

13:22.041 --> 13:25.333
- And a goddamn smokeshow!
- He's got some good news.

13:25.333 --> 13:28.500
So, the school board's agreed
to take the appeal under review.

13:28.500 --> 13:30.541
Okay, that's the first step.

13:30.541 --> 13:32.916
And it is all thanks to you, Alice.

13:32.916 --> 13:36.875
That's right.
Alice and her maniac bulldog bark.

13:36.875 --> 13:40.375
All y'all know where that maniac
bulldog bark came from, right?

13:40.375 --> 13:43.416
Alice's hope
that she can change the world.

13:43.416 --> 13:47.000
I love it! And that deserves a Titty Bomb!

13:47.000 --> 13:48.416
Enough!

13:48.416 --> 13:53.125
Oh, I hate to break it to you,
but that feels better comin' out that end.

13:54.125 --> 13:56.708
I'm looking forward
to our romantic sushi date tonight.

13:56.708 --> 13:57.833
Mmm, me too.

13:57.833 --> 14:01.250
I'll make sure to set the thermostat
to a comfortable 74.

14:01.250 --> 14:04.875
Uh, no, 72. Raw fish.

14:04.875 --> 14:07.791
You're such a dork, Pete. I love it.

14:07.791 --> 14:10.375
Well, I love you, Rochelle.

14:10.375 --> 14:12.875
I... love you too, Pete.

14:12.875 --> 14:14.708
Oh my God. You do?

14:14.708 --> 14:17.375
- I do. I really do.
- Wow...

14:18.541 --> 14:20.875
Uh... How-- How come you're not glowing?

14:20.875 --> 14:24.708
Oh, I'm saving it for tonight,
so it's special.

14:24.708 --> 14:27.750
Oh man, I love special things.

14:27.750 --> 14:30.625
I'll see you at 6:45 on the dot.

14:30.625 --> 14:31.958
- Love you.
- Love you!

14:31.958 --> 14:34.833
-"Love you"? Okay.
- Shut up, Emmy.

14:34.833 --> 14:38.125
I'm just saying,
I've seen you glow for tacos.

14:38.125 --> 14:41.458
- It's a different kinda love.
- You glow for Jake from State Farm.

14:41.458 --> 14:43.958
Well, yeah. He's so helpful.
What's your point, Emmy?

14:43.958 --> 14:46.625
Nothing. Just that Pete's
a sensitive Rock.

14:46.625 --> 14:49.375
- And I don't wanna see him get hurt.
- He's not gonna get hurt.

14:49.375 --> 14:52.250
He's gonna get glowed on tonight by my ass
because I love him.

14:52.250 --> 14:56.125
- Weird tone, but that's great, Rochelle.
- Thank you. It is great.

14:56.125 --> 14:58.875
Out soon in theaters,
<i>Rochelle's Glow for Pete.</i>

14:58.875 --> 15:02.166
Rated R for "real." Okay, I'm gonna go.

15:02.750 --> 15:06.041
Holy shit. New meat?

15:06.041 --> 15:10.000
Connie, it's me, Maury, from <i>Big Mouth.</i>
I-- I'm healthy now.

15:10.000 --> 15:13.791
Oh, even better.
Old meat, new sexy package.

15:13.791 --> 15:15.000
What the fuck happened?

15:15.000 --> 15:17.750
One garden salad
has changed my entire personality.

15:17.750 --> 15:21.541
That makes perfect sense.
I'd like to get into your pants, please.

15:21.541 --> 15:26.625
Oh, I would love that, but unfortunately,
it has to wait until after my run.

15:26.625 --> 15:28.458
You're going for a run?

15:28.458 --> 15:30.583
But we're supposed to have
drugs-and-date night.

15:30.583 --> 15:33.250
Oh, sweetheart,
I'm never doing drugs again.

15:33.250 --> 15:35.333
Rochelle was right. My body is a temple.

15:35.333 --> 15:37.166
Goddamn it, Rochelle.

15:37.166 --> 15:41.625
I don't even remember
the slovenly old pig-monster I once was.

15:44.041 --> 15:46.541
I knew I could eat this whole burrito
in one day.

15:46.541 --> 15:49.666
Maury, it's supposed to be
drugs-and-date night.

15:49.666 --> 15:53.208
How we gonna drop acid if you're still
making mouth-love to that burrito?

15:53.208 --> 15:57.958
I couldn't possibly eat
even that tiny tab of acid.

15:57.958 --> 15:59.291
Uh-oh.

15:59.291 --> 16:02.166
Maury, your burrito's
playing peekaboo with me.

16:04.458 --> 16:05.541
That's not good.

16:05.541 --> 16:08.875
Ooh, everybody out of the way!
I've got a tushy emergency!

16:08.875 --> 16:11.083
Oh, Emmy, I gotta say, you were right.

16:11.083 --> 16:13.875
Alcohol really dulls
the experience of living.

16:13.875 --> 16:15.000
Told ya!

16:15.000 --> 16:18.666
Couple drinks, you're still sad,
but couple more, you get happy,

16:18.666 --> 16:22.750
and if you keep going after that,
you feel absolutely nothing.

16:22.750 --> 16:24.208
Can't wait.

16:24.208 --> 16:27.583
And after I dumped him, he cried.
You ever seen a Rock cry?

16:27.583 --> 16:31.291
No, but once I watched a man
fall off a mountain,

16:31.291 --> 16:33.333
and he was like, "Aargh!"

16:33.333 --> 16:37.375
Oh God, I wanna feel absolutely nothing.

16:38.583 --> 16:40.916
I feel so alive.

16:40.916 --> 16:43.250
What should we do now?
Sink a big ol' boat?

16:43.250 --> 16:47.500
Mmm, I have a better idea.
Let's go bowling for cars.

16:47.500 --> 16:50.333
Girl, that sounds
like fuckin' mayhem. I'm in.

16:52.541 --> 16:53.875
- Yeah.
- Oh yeah.

16:53.875 --> 16:56.125
- Uh-huh. Right there.
- Really?

16:56.125 --> 16:59.041
- You're okay with my one penis?
- Please stop asking that, Pete.

16:59.041 --> 17:00.708
Oh, yeah, yeah, I'm sorry, I--

17:00.708 --> 17:02.291
- Ow! Shit!
- Ow! Oh, God!

17:02.291 --> 17:04.083
- No, it's okay.
- Yeah, okay. I-I'm sorry.

17:04.083 --> 17:05.250
Just keep going.

17:05.250 --> 17:06.500
I just love you so much.

17:06.500 --> 17:08.958
And I love you, Pete.

17:08.958 --> 17:11.333
- Oh! Oh my God! You're glowing.
- Mm-hmm.

17:11.333 --> 17:12.750
Just like you said you would.

17:12.750 --> 17:16.625
Oh, I love it
when a plan comes to fruition!

17:16.625 --> 17:18.625
Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho!

17:20.041 --> 17:23.208
- Uh, what was that?
- Nothing. Just a queef.

17:23.208 --> 17:25.375
<i>Sorry, I didn't quite get that.</i>

17:25.375 --> 17:28.666
Um, Rochelle, why do your genitals
sound like Siri?

17:28.666 --> 17:32.916
Uh, because your one penis
fucked me so greatly? Oh...

17:32.916 --> 17:36.125
Wait, did you have your phone
in your butt?

17:36.125 --> 17:37.791
Uh, what? [chuckles] Of course not.

17:37.791 --> 17:41.166
- Oh, God. You were faking your glow.
- I-I can explain.

17:41.166 --> 17:43.541
- You obviously don't really love me.
- Well, I'm trying!

17:43.541 --> 17:45.500
Oh, oh, oh, oh, you're "trying"?

17:45.500 --> 17:48.000
Well, I'm sorry
I'm making it so difficult.

17:48.000 --> 17:51.083
I just--
I meant I'm trying to make this work.

17:51.083 --> 17:54.000
You're sweet and honest and good for me.

17:54.000 --> 17:57.250
"Good for you"? Oh my God,
I sound like a vitamin or something.

17:57.250 --> 17:59.000
- Pete, please, I--
- Uh...

17:59.000 --> 18:00.750
- I gotta get out of here.
- Don't go!

18:00.750 --> 18:03.875
And honestly,
you need to clean that phone.

18:03.875 --> 18:05.833
Take the case off
and really get in there.

18:05.833 --> 18:07.208
Oh God. Pete, please.

18:07.208 --> 18:09.083
- Goodbye, Rochelle.
- Pete, wait!

18:09.833 --> 18:14.833
Why did I give a Hate Worm an ultimatum?

18:14.833 --> 18:17.916
Feminists don't give ultimatums.

18:17.916 --> 18:20.416
First of all, yes, we do,

18:20.416 --> 18:25.250
and secondly, you did what you did
'cause you're a good man, man.

18:25.250 --> 18:26.708
Oh, I don't know.

18:26.708 --> 18:28.791
You're kind and thoughtful,

18:28.791 --> 18:33.166
and-- and anyone would be lucky
to get plowed up the tailpipe

18:33.166 --> 18:35.375
with your big, stone peen.

18:35.375 --> 18:36.916
Really?

18:36.916 --> 18:39.541
Yeah, and you've got a big heart.

18:39.541 --> 18:41.833
I mean, you would never hurt anyone.

18:41.833 --> 18:43.541
U-Unless you rolled down a hill

18:43.541 --> 18:45.916
onto someone's campsite or some--
crushed 'em, ya know?

18:45.916 --> 18:47.291
I am very heavy.

18:47.291 --> 18:50.625
You are, but I sit next to you every day,

18:50.625 --> 18:54.041
and even though I annoy you so much,

18:54.041 --> 18:56.416
you haven't even killed me once.

18:56.416 --> 18:58.375
I love you, man.

18:58.375 --> 18:59.625
I love you too, Emmy.

18:59.625 --> 19:01.791
You deserve the best.

19:01.791 --> 19:03.291
- To us.
- Yeah.

19:03.291 --> 19:06.166
Fuck those assholes who don't love us.

19:06.166 --> 19:09.750
- Fuck me! I'm having a heart attack.
- What?

19:09.750 --> 19:12.458
Everyone stop drinking
and stare at my problem.

19:12.458 --> 19:14.166
Don't you die on me, Maury!

19:14.166 --> 19:19.500
I refuse to be a single parent.
I will ditch Montel if you croak.

19:19.500 --> 19:21.750
Somebody get me to a doctor.

19:21.750 --> 19:24.791
Pete, you gotta drive my tubby not-hubby
to the hospital.

19:24.791 --> 19:28.916
Um, I really shouldn't drive
because I've had quite a few cocktails.

19:28.916 --> 19:31.083
Oh, Connie, why can't you drive me?

19:31.083 --> 19:33.083
Because, asshole,

19:33.083 --> 19:36.250
I decided to do drugs-and-date night
without you.

19:36.250 --> 19:38.541
I'm tripping balls right now.

19:38.541 --> 19:40.250
My left nut hurts.

19:40.250 --> 19:42.791
Nutsack Pete, he's gonna die.

19:42.791 --> 19:46.541
I'll drive. I'm actually a better driver
when I'm drunk.

19:46.541 --> 19:47.958
- Oh!
- Oh, no.

19:49.750 --> 19:54.125
This is the end.
Struck down in my prime.

19:54.125 --> 19:56.250
I should have listened to you, Connie.

19:56.250 --> 19:59.500
Get that tattooed
on your fuckin' forehead, you idiot.

19:59.500 --> 20:01.916
Come on, Testicle Emmy. Drive faster!

20:01.916 --> 20:05.291
I'm trying, okay?
But it's pissing rain out there.

20:07.625 --> 20:09.916
Uh, Maury? I don't think
this is a heart attack.

20:09.916 --> 20:11.208
I think it's something else.

20:11.208 --> 20:13.250
- Oh no.
- Don't even say it.

20:13.250 --> 20:14.833
It's the bubble guts!

20:14.833 --> 20:17.541
Oh God, oh no! Not the bubble guts.

20:17.541 --> 20:20.375
My cousin's husband
died of the bubble guts.

20:20.375 --> 20:22.041
He had children, Maury,

20:22.041 --> 20:24.458
and now those children
don't have a father,

20:24.458 --> 20:27.166
which means the mom
has to do all the work.

20:27.166 --> 20:31.333
Oh, I should have gotten
that garden salad.

20:31.333 --> 20:35.125
Thank God I got that garden salad.
I feel so alive.

20:35.125 --> 20:37.875
Maury, are you done with your run yet?

20:37.875 --> 20:40.375
I wanna make love on your hot new bod.

20:40.375 --> 20:45.041
Many thank-yous for taking us
to the Olive Garden, Walter.

20:45.041 --> 20:47.583
Told y'all this coupon would come back.

20:47.583 --> 20:51.041
Olive Garden. We have the meats!

20:51.041 --> 20:53.416
Oh, Rick. That's Arby's.

20:53.416 --> 20:56.541
You're pathetic, Pete.

20:56.541 --> 21:00.541
You thought you had a chance with her
with your one penis?

21:00.541 --> 21:05.375
Oh, Rochelle, why did I think
you could love me?

21:05.375 --> 21:06.875
Pete, please slow down.

21:06.875 --> 21:10.875
How could clenching a phone
in my ass crack during sex go so wrong?

21:10.875 --> 21:11.875
Pete!

21:13.666 --> 21:15.333
Bowling for cars is fun as hell.

21:15.333 --> 21:18.291
You come to the Hate Division,
we do this shit every Tuesday.

21:19.416 --> 21:23.125
Well, this has been great. I promise
I will give you an answer very soon.

21:23.125 --> 21:27.083
Just don't take too long.
You don't want me as an enemy.

21:27.083 --> 21:28.166
I'm just kidding.

21:28.166 --> 21:30.583
I'm not though. I'm a legit psychopath.

21:33.666 --> 21:37.166
Woohoo! We're going to the Olive Garden
in this timeline as well.

21:38.083 --> 21:39.708
Hello, party bus.

21:39.708 --> 21:42.791
Is that Rochelle? With a bowling ball?

21:42.791 --> 21:46.125
Who cares? My bubble guts
are about to bubble-splode.

21:46.125 --> 21:49.875
You gotta get it out your butt
before it busts open your gut.

21:49.875 --> 21:53.041
- I can't!
- Maury, I'm gonna sit on you.

21:53.041 --> 21:54.833
My tushy on your tummy.

21:54.833 --> 21:56.333
Oh, Connie, I'm scared.

21:56.333 --> 21:59.500
My ass will help you pass that gas.

21:59.500 --> 22:01.916
Okay, Maury, here it comes!

22:03.791 --> 22:06.041
- It's hot.
- You did it, Maury.

22:06.041 --> 22:09.041
Oh my God, it's thick in my mouth.

22:09.041 --> 22:10.875
It's burning my eyes!

22:10.875 --> 22:12.875
I can't see! I'm blind!

22:12.875 --> 22:16.041
Emmy, the road!

22:16.041 --> 22:18.125
For the last time, Rick,

22:18.125 --> 22:20.791
"I'm Lovin' It" is McDonald's,
not Olive Garden.

22:20.791 --> 22:22.041
The fuck?

22:23.000 --> 22:26.166
Ain't no one gonna bowl
my car off the road.

22:28.500 --> 22:30.791
Ah, damn. Gutter ball.

22:35.000 --> 22:37.125
Did we almost just die?

22:37.125 --> 22:40.625
Seriously, I still can't see,
and I think I have pink eye.

22:40.625 --> 22:43.541
And you really are a better driver
when you're drunk.

22:43.541 --> 22:49.166
I know. I mean, can you imagine
if we didn't go to the bar and get loaded?

22:49.166 --> 22:51.583
And if I hadn't eaten that burrito?

22:51.583 --> 22:55.666
And if I hadn't dropped the kind of acid
that turned y'all to balls?

22:55.666 --> 22:58.000
Life is full of little miracles.

22:59.375 --> 23:01.791
Maury, stop fartin'!

23:01.791 --> 23:03.416
Maury, stop runnin'!

23:03.416 --> 23:06.333
Ever since you ate that salad,
you haven't tossed mine.

23:06.333 --> 23:09.083
I don't have time
to eat butt-salad, Connie.

23:09.083 --> 23:11.500
My physical fitness
is much more fulfilling.

23:11.500 --> 23:14.583
No, no, no! I caught you.
Now you have to fuck me.

23:14.583 --> 23:16.208
Those are leprechaun rules.

23:16.208 --> 23:19.541
Oh, Connie, have you ever felt
the sensual pleasure

23:19.541 --> 23:22.291
of having your heart
pound out your fuckin' lungs?

23:22.291 --> 23:24.833
Oh no, Maury, are you on a--

23:24.833 --> 23:26.333
Runner's high!

23:26.333 --> 23:27.875
Yeah, baby!

23:27.875 --> 23:31.583
The endorphins are incredible.
We don't even need sex anymore.

23:31.583 --> 23:34.541
Oh God, no! You're a jogger now?

23:34.541 --> 23:39.916
For the last time, Rick, "I'm Lovin' It"
is McDonald's, not Olive Garden.

23:39.916 --> 23:42.708
And olives, they're salty grapes,
am I right?

23:42.708 --> 23:44.708
Why did I invite you?

23:45.916 --> 23:49.541
Oh my God, Rochelle.
Do you love me after all?

23:49.541 --> 23:51.833
Stay away from me, Maury!
Keep your fit bits to yourself.

23:51.833 --> 23:55.833
But, Connie, I'd really like you
to sign up for a 10K with me.

24:00.833 --> 24:02.375
Pete! Walter!

24:02.375 --> 24:04.625
Honestly, like, half the cast!

24:07.708 --> 24:09.791
No!

24:15.625 --> 24:17.458
I can't believe they're all gone.

24:17.458 --> 24:20.125
And I can't believe they didn't invite us
to the Olive Garden.

24:20.125 --> 24:21.333
But then we'd be dead.

24:21.333 --> 24:24.500
You know what, Joe? Just let me
be annoyed at the deceased, okay?

24:24.500 --> 24:28.250
I-- I did what I thought was right.

24:28.250 --> 24:31.041
I embraced love,
and it didn't even matter.

24:31.041 --> 24:33.625
Everyone I care about is gone.

24:34.166 --> 24:36.708
- You know, we're-- We're here.
- I don't care about you two!

24:36.708 --> 24:38.583
Oh! Angry little Lovebug alert!

24:38.583 --> 24:42.625
That's the thing.
I'm not a fuckin' Lovebug.

Rochelle Hillhurst.

25:15.166 --> 25:19.458
You and I,
we'll do terrible things together.

25:19.458 --> 25:23.291
And probably to each other.
I'm a fucking nightmare.

25:24.833 --> 25:28.333
Okay, so the Hate Worm timeline
is the real one?

25:28.333 --> 25:29.541
Yep, seems like it.

25:29.541 --> 25:32.416
So, you never really ate a garden salad?

25:32.416 --> 25:35.875
- Fucking of course not.
- Oh, thank God!

25:35.875 --> 25:40.333
You were unbearable. Please stay
a garbage truck full of shit forever.

25:40.333 --> 25:43.875
Oh, sweetheart, I'm never gonna lose
the baby weight.

25:43.875 --> 25:46.375
I think I'll just have
another baby instead.

25:46.375 --> 25:48.625
Uh, not with me, you won't.

25:48.625 --> 25:51.333
But I need your genes. Mine are so ugly.

25:51.333 --> 25:53.666
- Nope. No, thank you.
- But Connie. Come on.
