00:02.159 --> 00:04.794
Why did you get a genetic test?

00:05.028 --> 00:06.828
You're so young.

00:06.863 --> 00:08.898
I...

00:08.932 --> 00:12.967
My brother has a genetic disorder.

00:13.002 --> 00:14.802
So when the doctor offered the test,

00:14.836 --> 00:16.837
I just thought, "yeah, I should do that."

00:16.872 --> 00:18.806
I never actually expected...

00:21.877 --> 00:24.245
Oh my god. Oh my god.

00:27.015 --> 00:28.916
You have to tell Toby.

00:28.950 --> 00:31.785
If I tell him, then it's really happening.

00:31.819 --> 00:34.254
It's already happening.

00:34.289 --> 00:36.990
And you shouldn't be dealing
with this on your own.

00:37.025 --> 00:39.492
But he won't even talk to me.

00:41.195 --> 00:43.230
Just tell him the truth and he will.

00:45.565 --> 00:47.400
Do you want me to go with you?

00:50.070 --> 00:51.370
(Knocking)

00:57.477 --> 00:59.145
We need to talk.

01:01.013 --> 01:02.680
I don't have anything to say.

01:05.349 --> 01:08.653
You made it pretty clear you
think you're too good for me.

01:08.687 --> 01:09.988
I'm pregnant.

01:13.212 --> 01:14.745
Are you sure?

01:14.780 --> 01:16.081
Of course I'm sure!

01:16.115 --> 01:19.049
- Do you think I'm making this up?
- Well, is it mine?

01:19.084 --> 01:21.685
Yes. It's yours.

01:23.088 --> 01:25.021
How is that such a terrible thing to ask?

01:25.056 --> 01:28.024
- You said you were into somebody else.
- I said I was confused.

01:28.059 --> 01:30.427
I also said that nothing happened with him.

01:30.462 --> 01:32.796
I was faithful to you.

01:32.830 --> 01:35.431
I was honest with you all along.

01:35.466 --> 01:38.000
- I didn't do anything wrong.
- Wait.

01:38.034 --> 01:40.570
Do you know how hard that
was for me to tell you?

01:40.604 --> 01:43.106
Do you know what it's
been like living with this

01:43.140 --> 01:44.607
by myself for weeks?

01:44.641 --> 01:47.410
I've been panicked every minute of the day.

01:48.812 --> 01:51.180
You are equally responsible for this

01:51.215 --> 01:52.847
and I thought you should know.

01:55.451 --> 01:57.952
Thank you for making this so easy.

02:14.702 --> 02:15.869
Hey.

02:15.903 --> 02:17.904
- Hey!
- Hey, how's it goin'?

02:17.939 --> 02:22.409
Great. I signed up for
a Spanish course at UMKC.

02:22.444 --> 02:24.578
I will soon <i>habla all of the español.</i>

02:24.613 --> 02:27.113
Thatta girl. Embracing the native language.

02:27.148 --> 02:29.549
Well, there's this summer
course in Mexico City

02:29.583 --> 02:33.085
- that is sponsored by the Frida Kahlo museum...
- (Gasps)

02:33.120 --> 02:35.821
So I figured since I'm gonna apply

02:35.856 --> 02:38.724
- I should probably learn some Spanish.
- (Both laugh)

02:38.759 --> 02:41.194
<i>- Quieres un café?
- (Laughs) I said soon.</i>

02:41.228 --> 02:43.228
(Laughs) You want a coffee?

02:43.263 --> 02:44.663
<i>Sí.</i>

02:44.697 --> 02:46.198
- I'll get it.
- Okay.

02:47.333 --> 02:49.868
Hmm.

02:49.902 --> 02:51.537
That seems to be going well.

02:51.571 --> 02:54.206
Yeah. How 'bout you?

02:56.776 --> 02:58.510
It's still really hard.

02:58.545 --> 03:00.611
Oh, I know.

03:00.706 --> 03:03.541
On the plus side, I have so much space

03:03.575 --> 03:06.043
in my brain now that I
don't have a boy in my life.

03:06.077 --> 03:08.779
- There you go!
- And I have more time.

03:08.813 --> 03:09.770
I'm going to go out with Travis

03:09.771 --> 03:11.960
and some of the kids from
the deaf program tomorrow.

03:12.651 --> 03:14.785
I got so caught up in
all of the Emmett drama

03:14.819 --> 03:16.420
I sort of forgot about my friends.

03:16.455 --> 03:18.555
See? Being on your own has its perks.

03:18.589 --> 03:20.690
- Embrace it.
- (Sighs)

03:20.725 --> 03:22.859
- Here you go.
<i>- Gracias.</i>

03:22.893 --> 03:25.061
Already killing it.

03:26.664 --> 03:29.532
(Sighs)

03:29.567 --> 03:31.668
Is that gonna do it?

03:31.702 --> 03:33.035
I'll be straight with you.

03:33.070 --> 03:34.836
Once you file an amended return,

03:34.871 --> 03:37.640
- the IRS is on high alert.
- Meaning?

03:37.674 --> 03:40.809
Your chances of getting
audited increase exponentially.

03:40.843 --> 03:44.079
But hopefully this is the worst of it.

03:44.113 --> 03:48.116
Well, I hope it is because there's
nothing left for me to liquidate.

03:48.151 --> 03:50.586
That pretty much taps me out.

03:53.322 --> 03:56.191
Hey, honey! How was the new accountant?

03:56.225 --> 03:59.627
Ah... good. (Clears throat)
Think he's gonna work out.

03:59.661 --> 04:00.996
What's goin' on around here?

04:01.030 --> 04:03.999
Uh... I have a crazy idea.

04:04.033 --> 04:05.666
And I want to hear it.

04:05.701 --> 04:07.502
Well, I really don't want to wait around

04:07.536 --> 04:09.669
for someone to throw money at my musical.

04:09.704 --> 04:12.606
So, I was thinking... what
if I just produced it myself?

04:12.640 --> 04:14.774
Sure, I guess.

04:14.809 --> 04:17.077
There are so many amazing theaters

04:17.112 --> 04:18.712
in the Power & Light District.

04:18.745 --> 04:21.015
I was looking at 'em all morning.

04:21.048 --> 04:23.617
(Clears throat) What does
something like that cost?

04:23.651 --> 04:25.885
Ah... well...

04:25.919 --> 04:28.888
You know, with the theater
rental, the rehearsal space,

04:28.922 --> 04:33.493
actor stipends, about,
I don't know... $30,000.

04:34.528 --> 04:37.296
Yeah. No. (Coughs)

04:37.331 --> 04:39.632
It's just something I'm thinking about.

04:39.666 --> 04:41.501
(Muttering)

04:41.535 --> 04:45.037
- Huh.
- What's wrong?

04:45.071 --> 04:49.107
It's an e-mail from some of
the parents in the deaf program.

04:49.142 --> 04:52.210
They're concerned about the safety

04:52.245 --> 04:55.380
of the students at the school and they...

04:57.350 --> 04:59.283
They want to fire Melody.

04:59.317 --> 05:00.551
What?

05:00.585 --> 05:03.754
Do you think this is because
of what happened to Bay?

05:03.788 --> 05:06.690
Come on. That's ridiculous.
She had nothing to do with that.

05:08.393 --> 05:11.295
I can't believe that one "D" in chemistry

05:11.329 --> 05:13.531
cost me my entire scholarship.

05:13.565 --> 05:16.699
Hey, you can apply again next semester

05:16.733 --> 05:18.301
if your GPA is back up.

05:18.335 --> 05:20.437
Which it will be.

05:20.471 --> 05:23.373
But what am I gonna do about this semester?

05:23.407 --> 05:26.042
The scholarship covered,
like, half my tuition.

05:26.077 --> 05:29.645
Do what any other self
respecting undergraduate would do.

05:29.680 --> 05:31.548
- Ask your parents for money.
- (Scoffs)

05:31.582 --> 05:34.349
No. I hate asking them for stuff.

05:34.384 --> 05:37.652
Or you could donate plasma.

05:37.687 --> 05:40.755
(Gasps) Yes. Like 500 times.

05:40.790 --> 05:42.958
- Right.
- (Laughs)

05:44.360 --> 05:47.028
- Hey! Hi.
- Hey! Hi! Oh.

05:47.063 --> 05:50.431
Hey Mingo, this is my interpreter, Josh.

05:50.466 --> 05:52.333
Josh, this is my Mingo.

05:52.367 --> 05:55.470
No... no, I mean this... this is Mingo.

05:55.504 --> 05:57.972
- Nice to finally meet you.
- Likewise.

05:58.006 --> 06:00.040
Dude, that is a sick bow tie.

06:00.075 --> 06:03.077
Is that a... is that a clip
on or is that the real thing?

06:03.112 --> 06:05.045
It's the real thing.

06:05.080 --> 06:07.114
No, seriously, it's... I like it!

06:07.148 --> 06:08.381
It's really cool.

06:10.851 --> 06:13.620
I should get going.

06:13.654 --> 06:16.323
- I'll see you in Marillo's?
- Yeah. Bye.

06:17.891 --> 06:20.527
- Did you get my text?
- Yeah.

06:20.561 --> 06:22.862
Hey, but the fact that you ever even had

06:22.896 --> 06:24.796
a merit-based scholarship is impressive.

06:24.831 --> 06:27.433
Now you're totally average,
like the rest of us.

06:27.467 --> 06:28.834
(Both laugh)

06:28.868 --> 06:31.203
How 'bout this. I am
taking you out tonight.

06:31.238 --> 06:32.471
You are?

06:32.506 --> 06:34.773
Yeah. You gotta get your
mind off of all this academia.

06:34.807 --> 06:37.109
- Where are we going?
- Can't tell you. It's a surprise.

06:37.144 --> 06:41.179
- What kind of surprise?
- Mm. Like I said, a surprise.

06:46.952 --> 06:48.153
<i>Hola.</i>

06:48.187 --> 06:50.522
<i>Hola. ¿Cómo estás?</i>

06:50.556 --> 06:52.257
<i>Muy bien.</i>

06:52.291 --> 06:55.760
<i>- Necesito uh...</i>
 - You'll get there.

06:55.794 --> 06:58.162
I'll help you catch up. You
only missed a few classes.

06:58.196 --> 06:59.596
<i>Perfecto.</i>

06:59.631 --> 07:02.466
So, how goes the single life?

07:02.500 --> 07:04.334
Lie to me, tell me that
you've never been better.

07:04.369 --> 07:06.136
It's... it's not so bad.

07:06.171 --> 07:08.138
I've been using this new Boy Finder app.

07:08.173 --> 07:10.274
It's kinda fun.

07:10.308 --> 07:12.242
- (Phone beeps)
- Mary Beth: Oh.

07:12.277 --> 07:15.645
- What's with the tiger?
- No idea.

07:15.679 --> 07:16.812
(Both laugh)

07:16.846 --> 07:19.148
It's just nice to see
there are a lot of guys

07:19.183 --> 07:20.983
out there who aren't Travis.

07:21.017 --> 07:22.485
Indeed there are.

07:22.519 --> 07:26.155
Oh! In fact, I kissed one
of them the other night.

07:26.190 --> 07:29.525
- Yay! Who?
- It was some rando guy.

07:29.560 --> 07:34.062
I was at Scratch trying
not to think about Emmett,

07:34.096 --> 07:37.232
and the next thing I know, I just...

07:37.266 --> 07:40.468
I grabbed this poor guy and
started attacking his face.

07:40.503 --> 07:43.271
- Was he cute?
- I don't even remember.

07:43.306 --> 07:46.074
- I can top that.
- Try me.

07:46.108 --> 07:50.211
Last weekend I was at a party
and I was really missing Travis,

07:50.245 --> 07:53.980
so I kissed this very short
freshman who plays the mandolin.

07:54.015 --> 07:55.449
And then I started to cry.

07:55.483 --> 07:57.518
- Oh. You win.
- Yep.

07:57.552 --> 07:59.720
- We're living the dream!
- (Laughs)

07:59.754 --> 08:02.789
<i>Buenas. ¿Cómo está todo el mundo hoy?</i>

08:02.824 --> 08:05.392
<i>¿Listos? Emocionados?</i>

08:05.427 --> 08:06.459
<i>Bien.</i>

08:06.493 --> 08:08.961
<i>Hoy vamos a conjugar verbos.</i>

08:08.995 --> 08:10.896
Oh, quick reminder before we get started.

08:10.931 --> 08:12.164
Everyone check their emails.

08:12.199 --> 08:15.034
There's a mandatory sexual
assault seminar this weekend.

08:15.068 --> 08:16.469
I can't believe they're forcing us to do

08:16.503 --> 08:19.138
some stupid seminar at
8:00 A.M. on a Saturday.

08:19.172 --> 08:21.441
It's 'cause of that girl who
got raped in the deaf dorm.

08:21.475 --> 08:23.275
Yeah, probably.

08:23.309 --> 08:24.800
Alvarez: Oh, wait,

08:24.801 --> 08:28.091
- _
-  there's a new student with us today.

08:28.180 --> 08:30.315
A <i>señorita </i> Kennish?

08:32.385 --> 08:33.652
Bay Kennish?

08:37.557 --> 08:39.323
<i>Bienvenida.</i>

08:40.759 --> 08:43.059
<i>Empecemos.</i>

08:43.094 --> 08:46.196
<i>El verbo ayudar... to help.</i>

08:46.231 --> 08:48.633
- <i>Yo ayudo.</i>
- _

08:48.667 --> 08:50.868
<i>Tú ayudas.</i>

08:50.902 --> 08:53.271
<i>Ellos ayudan.</i>

09:02.272 --> 09:04.045
_

09:04.062 --> 09:05.218
Is this a bad time?

09:05.219 --> 09:07.401
_

09:10.033 --> 09:13.970
I um... I just wanted to check in.

09:14.071 --> 09:16.665
_

09:16.974 --> 09:18.440
You know about that.

09:18.741 --> 09:24.141
_

09:24.342 --> 09:27.990
_

09:32.191 --> 09:33.551
_

09:35.258 --> 09:38.360
John and I don't agree.

09:38.394 --> 09:41.496
Parents are just looking to blame someone.

09:41.530 --> 09:45.199
What happened is not your fault.

09:46.650 --> 09:47.800
_

09:50.001 --> 09:56.720
_

09:57.012 --> 09:58.612
Because of what happened?

09:58.913 --> 10:07.080
_

10:07.121 --> 10:10.023
No. Don't think that.

10:11.358 --> 10:13.826
Have you tried talking with the parents?

10:13.827 --> 10:17.005
_

10:17.306 --> 10:21.856
_

10:21.885 --> 10:24.702
What if I talked to her?

10:24.737 --> 10:28.606
I could appeal to her, mom to mom.

10:28.641 --> 10:31.376
Defend you and the program.

10:31.411 --> 10:34.546
Especially as the parent
who should be most concerned.

10:34.847 --> 10:36.447
_

10:38.417 --> 10:40.251
Come on. It's worth a shot.

10:40.285 --> 10:41.352
Is she hearing or deaf?

10:41.353 --> 10:42.761
_

10:42.921 --> 10:45.990
Great. I'll call her and set it up.

10:46.024 --> 10:48.292
It can't hurt, right?

10:50.293 --> 10:51.905
_

10:53.897 --> 10:57.067
- You okay?
- Yeah. I'm fine.

10:57.101 --> 10:59.202
I'll see you in class tomorrow.

10:59.236 --> 11:00.703
Bay?

11:00.737 --> 11:03.173
- Yeah.
- I'm Darcie.

11:03.207 --> 11:05.976
- Hi.
- So do you go here now?

11:06.010 --> 11:08.278
Um, I'm... I'm just taking a class.

11:08.312 --> 11:11.580
Cool. I just wanted to say
that I think you're awesome.

11:11.614 --> 11:13.882
Oh... thank you?

11:13.916 --> 11:15.184
What you did was really brave.

11:15.218 --> 11:17.353
Standing up to your attacker like that.

11:17.387 --> 11:19.521
I just think it's really
admirable that you testified,

11:19.555 --> 11:20.990
and got that creep expelled.

11:21.024 --> 11:22.624
It wasn't like that.

11:24.027 --> 11:25.994
I'm so sorry. I should go.

11:27.629 --> 11:31.599
I want to say I... I'm really proud of you

11:31.633 --> 11:34.735
for taking that chemistry class again.

11:34.769 --> 11:38.639
I know that, you know,
getting back up on that horse,

11:38.673 --> 11:40.508
that takes a lot of guts.

11:42.111 --> 11:45.879
Um, actually about that...

11:45.913 --> 11:52.219
my chemistry grade sunk
my GPA a little bit.

11:52.253 --> 11:56.123
I lost my academic scholarship.

11:56.157 --> 12:00.326
And my housing and tuition are due.

12:01.528 --> 12:03.496
I'll take care of that.

12:03.930 --> 12:07.133
Are you sure? I could talk to my mom.

12:07.167 --> 12:10.569
No, no, no. I don't... I don't
want you worrying about anything.

12:10.603 --> 12:13.339
I want you focused on school.

12:14.441 --> 12:16.175
Thank you.

12:16.209 --> 12:18.009
- I'm so sorry.
- Hey.

12:18.044 --> 12:20.311
Come on. Not a problem.

12:21.880 --> 12:24.482
Well, I gotta get back to class.

12:24.517 --> 12:27.519
- But thanks for lunch.
- Hey, my pleasure. Yeah.

12:30.289 --> 12:31.689
- Bye.
- Bye!

12:52.008 --> 12:54.410
(Engine stalls)

12:59.483 --> 13:00.849
(Sighs)

13:05.122 --> 13:07.022
- Hey.
- Hey!

13:07.057 --> 13:10.425
- How was the class?
- Uh, it was good.

13:10.460 --> 13:13.595
But I got to thinking, why should
I spend all that money on a class

13:13.629 --> 13:15.997
when there is the school of life?

13:16.031 --> 13:17.765
Meaning?

13:17.800 --> 13:22.471
Meaning I have my very own
Spanish teacher right here.

13:22.505 --> 13:23.871
You could teach me!

13:23.906 --> 13:26.873
I will learn so much
faster through conversation.

13:26.908 --> 13:29.477
Is this a bad idea?

13:29.511 --> 13:32.346
No, I love it.

13:32.380 --> 13:33.380
(Exhales)

13:33.415 --> 13:35.749
But is everything okay?

13:35.783 --> 13:39.253
Totally. It's just a change of plans.

13:45.654 --> 13:48.264
_

13:48.265 --> 13:50.811
_

13:51.912 --> 13:53.215
_

13:56.170 --> 13:59.204
- Oh, hey.
- You seen Lily?

13:59.239 --> 14:00.639
She's out today.

14:02.775 --> 14:04.476
How are you?

14:08.047 --> 14:09.748
You know?

14:09.782 --> 14:12.384
Yeah. She told me.

14:14.354 --> 14:16.987
So I'm the last to find out.

14:20.526 --> 14:22.293
Come on. Let's go outside.

14:25.564 --> 14:30.334
I found her in the bathroom, really upset.

14:30.369 --> 14:34.837
She doesn't really have anyone
else to talk to about it.

14:34.872 --> 14:38.341
What are you guys gonna do?

14:38.376 --> 14:40.243
I don't know.

14:40.278 --> 14:42.912
She won't talk to me.

14:42.946 --> 14:45.215
Why not?

14:46.717 --> 14:53.689
When she told me, she totally
caught me off guard and...

14:53.723 --> 14:58.026
I may not have reacted
in... in the best way, so...

14:58.061 --> 15:01.363
Don't beat yourself up.

15:01.398 --> 15:04.600
It's huge news for anyone to get.

15:04.634 --> 15:09.003
I mean, first that she's
pregnant and then...

15:12.508 --> 15:14.075
And then?

15:18.814 --> 15:20.648
Oh.

15:20.683 --> 15:22.450
There's something else?

15:22.484 --> 15:25.118
What else?

15:27.388 --> 15:29.389
It's not my place to say.

15:30.891 --> 15:32.492
What's going on?

15:32.527 --> 15:34.127
You should talk to her.

15:34.161 --> 15:36.330
But she didn't tell me.

15:36.364 --> 15:38.332
I need to know.

15:38.366 --> 15:39.899
Right now.

15:46.212 --> 15:47.122
So?

15:47.323 --> 15:48.480
What do you think?

15:48.481 --> 15:50.685
- Has your warranty expired?
- Yep.

15:50.719 --> 15:53.354
I gotta be honest. It doesn't look good.

15:53.388 --> 15:54.688
How not good?

15:54.722 --> 15:56.823
Well, your engine block's cracked.

15:56.858 --> 16:00.561
And getting a new one in
from Germany... about $15,000.

16:00.595 --> 16:03.297
- $15,000?
- Yikes.

16:03.331 --> 16:04.532
Well, you can take it in if you want,

16:04.566 --> 16:05.732
that's just what I'm seeing.

16:05.767 --> 16:08.902
Might be time to put this
old friend out to pasture.

16:08.936 --> 16:09.969
(Groans)

16:10.003 --> 16:11.304
You ever thought about a Tesla?

16:11.338 --> 16:12.605
(Laughs) Tesla.

16:12.640 --> 16:15.007
Are you kidding? This
guy in an electric car?

16:15.042 --> 16:16.909
The extension cord jokes would never end.

16:16.943 --> 16:18.944
Ah, you gotta test drive one, man.

16:18.979 --> 16:21.714
Yeah, I'll... I'll think
about it. Thank you.

16:21.748 --> 16:22.748
(Clears throat)

16:25.319 --> 16:26.351
(Knocking)

16:28.888 --> 16:30.222
I need to talk to you.

16:30.256 --> 16:32.491
Well, I needed to talk to you.

16:32.525 --> 16:34.393
And you insulted me, so...

16:37.230 --> 16:38.897
I'm so sorry about that.

16:40.099 --> 16:42.401
You can come and go as you please.

16:42.435 --> 16:44.702
But this is happening inside of me.

16:44.736 --> 16:48.206
I can't sleep, I can't stop crying,

16:48.240 --> 16:50.508
or puking, or crying while puking,

16:50.542 --> 16:52.510
- that was fun...
- I know about the test.

16:58.350 --> 16:59.350
Uh...

17:05.089 --> 17:06.656
(Cheering and applauding)

17:08.693 --> 17:10.594
All right, this time, we need a place.

17:10.627 --> 17:14.063
- Does anybody have a place?
- Intergalactic space station!

17:14.098 --> 17:17.200
All right, intergalactic
space station it is!

17:17.233 --> 17:18.634
This is gonna be great.

17:18.667 --> 17:20.801
Or like, so terrible.

17:20.837 --> 17:22.438
Marco: How's it looking, Lieutenant?

17:22.472 --> 17:25.374
I can't keep our bearings.
We're drifting, sir.

17:25.407 --> 17:26.842
Marco: Good god! Get a grip, man!

17:26.876 --> 17:28.677
Just keep us focused on that battleship.

17:28.712 --> 17:31.280
Blake: But sir, it's been
years since I've seen your wife.

17:31.314 --> 17:33.815
- (Laughs)
- Marco: What are you trying to say, man?

17:33.816 --> 17:35.186
_

17:35.217 --> 17:36.684
Are you not into this?

17:36.719 --> 17:39.420
Improv is not for the weak of heart.

17:40.856 --> 17:42.423
I can't read his lips.

17:42.458 --> 17:44.559
The mustache makes it hard.

17:44.593 --> 17:48.529
- Four billion miles.
- Oh. That's a long time ago.

17:48.564 --> 17:51.065
Guess we'll have to shave him then.

17:51.099 --> 17:55.135
It's not a big deal. I can follow a little.

17:55.169 --> 17:56.703
(Improv scene continues)

18:10.517 --> 18:14.654
Sorry. My brother's
going through some stuff.

18:14.688 --> 18:16.589
Just checking in with him.

18:18.124 --> 18:20.660
Is everything okay?

18:20.694 --> 18:22.395
Yeah.

18:25.265 --> 18:27.532
Actually, no.

18:27.566 --> 18:29.801
Come on. Let's get out of here.

18:44.115 --> 18:46.317
I reacted badly. I'm sorry.

18:46.351 --> 18:48.852
- It's just...
- It's okay.

18:51.022 --> 18:52.756
I don't know what to do.

18:55.960 --> 18:58.595
I don't even know how we'd afford it.

18:58.630 --> 19:01.230
And you can barely pay your rent, as it is.

19:01.264 --> 19:05.034
Yeah. Thanks for that.

19:07.270 --> 19:10.906
And it's not just any baby.

19:10.941 --> 19:13.309
My brother's needs dictated everything.

19:13.344 --> 19:16.011
Vacations, where we lived...

19:16.046 --> 19:19.548
everything revolved
around him and his care.

19:19.582 --> 19:23.418
And it was a huge strain on
my parents' marriage, too.

19:23.453 --> 19:25.153
I bet.

19:27.156 --> 19:29.958
But he's the reason I
learned sign language.

19:29.992 --> 19:32.627
He's the reason I taught at Carlton.

19:32.662 --> 19:35.062
He put me on this whole path...

19:36.598 --> 19:38.399
and I love him.

19:39.801 --> 19:42.936
But this isn't about him.

19:42.971 --> 19:44.972
This is about us.

19:46.742 --> 19:49.076
And I don't think we're ready for this.

19:52.012 --> 19:53.380
I know.

19:56.584 --> 19:58.885
As hard as this is,

19:58.919 --> 20:01.388
I think we know what we have to do.

20:03.156 --> 20:04.758
I know.

20:11.063 --> 20:14.065
Wow. That's so heavy.

20:14.100 --> 20:16.568
Yeah. It's a lot.

20:19.406 --> 20:21.774
Happened to my aunt and uncle, too.

20:21.808 --> 20:24.542
But they um... you know.

20:27.446 --> 20:30.281
Well, that's what most
people do these days.

20:30.315 --> 20:33.551
Yeah. It makes sense.

20:38.223 --> 20:42.626
I don't think that's
the obvious thing to do.

20:42.660 --> 20:44.060
Is that what you're saying?

20:46.263 --> 20:51.167
I am saying that that kid
would have a really hard life.

20:51.201 --> 20:52.869
I think we can agree on that.

20:52.904 --> 20:54.137
No.

20:54.171 --> 20:56.740
You're not willing to admit that a family

20:56.774 --> 21:00.409
with a Down syndrome kid would have
a tougher life than other families?

21:02.879 --> 21:06.749
I think that it requires more adjustments,

21:06.783 --> 21:10.453
maybe even sacrifice, but
I am sure that they have

21:10.487 --> 21:13.422
as much love and affection and happiness

21:13.457 --> 21:15.523
- as any other family.
- Okay.

21:16.992 --> 21:19.928
Do you think that my life is
harder than a hearing person's?

21:19.962 --> 21:21.963
Well... yeah.

21:23.231 --> 21:26.067
But... but you're wrong. It isn't.

21:26.101 --> 21:29.571
Y... you said yourself that's maybe
why you got a "D" in chemistry.

21:29.605 --> 21:31.806
I was just having a moment of weakness.

21:31.841 --> 21:34.808
Daphne, of course it is harder.

21:34.843 --> 21:36.810
I mean, you can't hear music.

21:36.845 --> 21:39.045
Of course I can. In my own way.

21:39.080 --> 21:40.981
You can't go places where it's dark

21:41.015 --> 21:42.583
because you have to read lips.

21:42.617 --> 21:44.417
So I go where it's light.

21:44.452 --> 21:46.119
Or go with people who can sign.

21:46.153 --> 21:49.055
But it's harder.

21:49.090 --> 21:51.757
No. It isn't.

21:51.792 --> 21:55.327
You just adjust, and
then it's not a big deal.

21:55.362 --> 21:56.829
It really isn't.

21:56.864 --> 22:00.065
No. No. If we are going to be together,

22:00.100 --> 22:01.567
I need you to get that.

22:01.602 --> 22:04.570
Like, really get that.

22:04.605 --> 22:06.005
Okay.

22:07.673 --> 22:08.907
(Sighs)

22:12.945 --> 22:14.045
(Sighs)

22:31.946 --> 22:37.490
_

22:38.791 --> 22:41.735
_

22:51.236 --> 22:52.417
_

22:52.462 --> 22:55.531
I... I think those were
some of Tank's friends.

22:57.432 --> 22:58.782
_

22:58.802 --> 23:01.604
Oh, no. It's fine. Let... let's just go in.

23:13.248 --> 23:15.050
(Indistinct conversation)

23:24.694 --> 23:25.926
All right! Fine!

23:25.961 --> 23:28.662
It's me, Bay Kennish,
the girl from the party.

23:28.697 --> 23:29.730
Here I am.

23:29.764 --> 23:32.265
And please, if anyone
has anything to say to me,

23:32.300 --> 23:34.401
you can say it to my face.

23:34.435 --> 23:36.670
I was just saying I
think your boots are cool.

23:38.073 --> 23:40.874
(Scoffs) Geez, narcissist.

23:46.013 --> 23:48.915
- Leave her alone.
- Dude, back off. Man...

23:48.949 --> 23:50.717
- (clattering)
- Whoa! Oh hey! No, no, no, no, no! Stop!

23:50.751 --> 23:52.785
Stop. Stop. Travis, stop!

23:52.820 --> 23:54.630
What... what the hell was that?

23:54.631 --> 23:55.531
_

23:55.532 --> 23:57.957
Nothing, okay? It was nothing.

23:57.958 --> 23:59.830
_

23:59.831 --> 24:01.350
_

24:01.353 --> 24:03.161
No! Travis. Travis!

24:03.195 --> 24:07.233
Just leave it. This has
nothing to do with you.

24:12.538 --> 24:14.339
I gotta get out of here.

24:19.831 --> 24:22.767
I really appreciate you
sitting down with me.

24:22.801 --> 24:24.802
Well, I appreciate you reaching out.

24:24.836 --> 24:27.138
But honestly, I'm not sure
what there is to talk about.

24:27.173 --> 24:28.906
I've already withdrawn my daughter.

24:28.940 --> 24:30.741
She'll take off the rest of the semester

24:30.776 --> 24:32.109
then go to Gallaudet in the fall.

24:32.144 --> 24:34.278
My daughter Daphne was
gonna go to Gallaudet, too.

24:34.312 --> 24:37.080
And that's what Melody is
trying to do with this program,

24:37.114 --> 24:40.484
give local students a closer option.

24:40.518 --> 24:42.486
Yeah, it was a nice idea.

24:42.520 --> 24:46.990
Melody is doing amazing
things with this program.

24:47.024 --> 24:49.859
It's not a safe environment for girls.

24:49.894 --> 24:51.727
Okay. What have you heard?

24:51.761 --> 24:53.696
A girl was raped in that dorm.

24:53.730 --> 24:56.932
I know about that. But it's a
very very complicated situation.

24:56.966 --> 24:59.802
Clearly these kids are not
being supervised, at all.

24:59.836 --> 25:01.970
Look, it could happen in any dorm.

25:02.005 --> 25:05.174
In fact, unfortunately, it's happening
in dorms all over the country.

25:05.209 --> 25:07.576
Well, I'm only responsible for my daughter.

25:07.610 --> 25:08.876
Of course.

25:10.012 --> 25:13.648
But if we keep hovering
them and yanking them out

25:13.683 --> 25:15.684
at any sign of danger,
how are they gonna learn

25:15.718 --> 25:17.118
how to stand up for themselves?

25:17.152 --> 25:19.254
I don't think it makes
me a helicopter parent

25:19.288 --> 25:21.423
to want to protect my
daughter from being assaulted.

25:23.025 --> 25:25.259
(Sighs, stammers)

25:25.293 --> 25:26.727
Look, it was my daughter.

25:28.062 --> 25:29.496
What?

25:29.531 --> 25:31.565
My other daughter, Bay.

25:31.600 --> 25:33.534
But she's taking classes there.

25:33.568 --> 25:36.237
She's facing it. She's not running away.

25:36.271 --> 25:39.072
I'm very sorry for what happened to her.

25:39.107 --> 25:40.841
Thank you.

25:40.875 --> 25:43.710
But I won't let that sort
of thing happen to Sadie.

25:43.744 --> 25:45.645
And frankly, I think you're crazy

25:45.679 --> 25:48.948
to let your daughter go back there
and wait for it to happen again.

25:48.982 --> 25:52.218
Are you saying that I let
this happen to my daughter?

25:52.253 --> 25:54.220
For her to get so intoxicated

25:54.255 --> 25:55.588
she doesn't know what's happening?

25:55.623 --> 25:57.022
She made a mistake.

25:58.558 --> 26:01.426
I came here to talk about the program

26:01.461 --> 26:04.195
and Melody Bledsoe, who is a passionate,

26:04.230 --> 26:06.865
committed, highly respected leader.

26:06.899 --> 26:10.369
And I firmly believe that she is
the best person to run this program.

26:10.403 --> 26:12.337
Now, if you want to be the kind of parent

26:12.372 --> 26:14.606
who makes snap judgments out of fear,

26:14.641 --> 26:16.307
then frankly, we don't need you.

26:17.442 --> 26:19.577
Thank you so much for your time.

26:19.611 --> 26:20.778
(Scoffs)

26:28.887 --> 26:30.588
(Footsteps, knocking)

26:30.622 --> 26:32.189
- Hey.
- Hey!

26:33.791 --> 26:36.058
Thanks for having Eric
take a look at my car.

26:36.093 --> 26:37.193
Oh, please.

26:37.227 --> 26:39.195
For him, it's a party. He loves that stuff.

26:39.229 --> 26:40.563
Yeah. I could tell.

26:40.598 --> 26:43.966
- Mm.
- Did you need something?

26:44.001 --> 26:46.703
I got a call from UMKC.

26:46.737 --> 26:49.105
- Daphne's tuition is past due?
- Yes.

26:49.139 --> 26:50.706
I am taking care of that.

26:50.740 --> 26:52.308
- Great.
- New accountant,

26:52.342 --> 26:55.043
wrote a check from the
wrong account, but I'm on it.

26:55.077 --> 26:56.445
Okay.

26:56.479 --> 26:59.014
But if it's more than just that...

26:59.048 --> 27:01.016
Regina, I said that I'm taking care of it.

27:01.050 --> 27:03.018
Okay.

27:03.052 --> 27:04.653
Thanks.

27:10.559 --> 27:12.393
Kathryn: Hey!

27:12.428 --> 27:13.528
How was class?

27:13.562 --> 27:17.097
Um... I didn't go.

27:17.132 --> 27:18.599
Why not?

27:22.638 --> 27:25.071
People keep making assumptions about me

27:25.105 --> 27:27.907
based on what happened with
Tank, and I'm sick of it.

27:29.176 --> 27:31.010
What happened?

27:33.214 --> 27:37.183
I went to a UMKC game with Travis,

27:37.218 --> 27:39.285
and I thought these girls
were talking about me,

27:39.320 --> 27:43.021
and Travis just lost it.

27:43.056 --> 27:45.057
He got right up in their faces.

27:45.091 --> 27:47.593
It was crazy. He completely freaked out

27:47.627 --> 27:49.762
and it had nothing to do with him.

27:51.097 --> 27:53.599
I think he took what
happened to you really hard.

27:53.633 --> 27:54.967
He's a good friend.

27:55.001 --> 27:57.169
But I don't need him to defend me.

27:57.203 --> 28:00.204
In fact, I don't need
anyone to do anything.

28:00.239 --> 28:05.443
But now for the rest of my life...

28:05.478 --> 28:08.513
when people find out, they're
gonna treat me differently.

28:08.547 --> 28:11.115
It's gonna haunt me forever.

28:13.285 --> 28:15.386
It doesn't have to haunt you.

28:15.420 --> 28:17.621
It'll always be part of you,

28:17.655 --> 28:19.690
but that doesn't have to be a bad thing.

28:19.724 --> 28:22.359
It can just be something that is.

28:24.529 --> 28:26.630
Something that you live with.

28:26.664 --> 28:28.932
Accept.

28:28.966 --> 28:31.401
Like I'm gonna grow stronger from it

28:31.435 --> 28:33.235
and learn from it?

28:33.270 --> 28:34.470
Maybe.

28:35.939 --> 28:39.642
Or maybe it's just
something that remains awful.

28:39.676 --> 28:41.644
But true.

28:41.678 --> 28:43.979
Something you don't run away from.

28:46.349 --> 28:48.884
I guess what I'm really trying to say is

28:48.918 --> 28:51.319
I don't think you should hide.

28:51.353 --> 28:54.489
I don't think you should let this
keep you from taking the class.

28:54.524 --> 28:57.626
Let them talk. You know who you are.

28:58.795 --> 29:01.229
I mean, you may not
understand what this experience

29:01.263 --> 29:04.699
means to you right now,
but it is your experience

29:04.734 --> 29:06.400
and no one else's to label.

29:09.805 --> 29:13.808
That said, I am behind you
no matter what you want to do.

29:27.009 --> 29:28.980
_

29:31.461 --> 29:33.262
I don't know if I can.

29:33.296 --> 29:36.532
I'm too weak and vulnerable

29:36.566 --> 29:38.400
to speak for myself.

29:38.801 --> 29:41.780
_

29:41.781 --> 29:43.975
_

29:43.976 --> 29:49.280
_

29:50.613 --> 29:52.280
I hate it too.

29:52.314 --> 29:55.316
But I'm dealing with it.

29:57.517 --> 29:59.307
_

30:01.708 --> 30:08.805
_

30:09.665 --> 30:11.098
No, you don't.

30:11.133 --> 30:14.135
Everyone thinks that they
get it, but they don't...

30:14.236 --> 30:15.632
_

30:18.372 --> 30:19.372
What do you mean?

30:26.873 --> 30:28.903
_

30:33.804 --> 30:37.500
_

30:39.425 --> 30:40.625
Travis.

30:42.195 --> 30:43.628
I'm so sorry.

30:45.629 --> 30:47.826
_

30:47.827 --> 30:52.385
_

30:52.394 --> 30:54.138
How old were you?

30:55.539 --> 30:59.539
_

31:01.113 --> 31:03.447
And you never told Mary Beth?

31:06.048 --> 31:08.520
_

31:11.521 --> 31:17.180
_

31:21.232 --> 31:23.633
I'm really glad that you told me.

31:25.034 --> 31:26.770
_

31:29.372 --> 31:32.474
And I don't think any differently of you.

31:35.075 --> 31:36.330
_

31:43.452 --> 31:47.521
So, how was the boy?

31:47.556 --> 31:48.823
He's good!

31:51.293 --> 31:52.293
(Scoffs)

31:53.629 --> 31:55.130
He's great.

31:55.164 --> 31:58.665
He's sweet, he listens to me,

31:58.699 --> 31:59.833
he makes me laugh...

31:59.868 --> 32:02.569
He's not your boss or your coworker...

32:02.603 --> 32:05.372
(Laughs) Yes! All good things.

32:08.009 --> 32:13.147
It's just there's some things about me that

32:13.181 --> 32:16.749
I'm not sure he'll ever fully get.

32:18.351 --> 32:19.752
About my deafness.

32:19.787 --> 32:21.954
Well, it's hard to get at first.

32:23.190 --> 32:24.490
It doesn't have to be.

32:24.524 --> 32:27.026
Do you remember how
John and Kathryn reacted?

32:27.060 --> 32:28.394
They thought deaf people couldn't drive.

32:28.428 --> 32:32.063
- And what's worse, I'm a vegetarian.
- (Gasps)

32:32.098 --> 32:34.599
- The horror.
- (Both laugh)

32:36.903 --> 32:39.370
It just takes some adjusting.

32:39.405 --> 32:40.906
Right?

32:40.940 --> 32:42.874
Exactly.

32:42.909 --> 32:45.576
You've made all of our lives richer.

32:45.611 --> 32:47.279
I can promise you that.

32:54.886 --> 32:57.087
It's not a final decision,

32:57.122 --> 33:00.891
but we're leaning towards not having it.

33:02.560 --> 33:05.862
- Oh.
- I mean, look at us.

33:05.896 --> 33:09.866
We're not ready to deal
with a kid like that.

33:11.969 --> 33:14.204
That's why I came here.

33:14.238 --> 33:16.272
I have to say something.

33:17.674 --> 33:20.276
This kid isn't gonna be perfect.

33:20.311 --> 33:22.345
But neither am I.

33:22.379 --> 33:27.850
Daphne, being deaf and having Down
syndrome is completely different.

33:27.884 --> 33:29.117
I know, but...

33:29.152 --> 33:31.619
And I thought you didn't
see yourself as disabled.

33:31.654 --> 33:33.755
You're right.

33:33.789 --> 33:35.790
They are not the same.

33:35.825 --> 33:38.126
But the world looks at both of us

33:38.161 --> 33:40.461
and thinks, "oh, how sad."

33:40.495 --> 33:44.498
But it's not sad. It's just different.

33:44.532 --> 33:46.300
That's what I wanted to tell you.

33:46.335 --> 33:48.702
There are a lot of things to think about

33:48.737 --> 33:50.704
- in this decision...
- (Sighs loudly)

33:50.739 --> 33:52.940
But I don't want you to think

33:52.975 --> 33:54.541
that different equals worse.

33:54.576 --> 33:57.010
- It's just different.
- Stop!

33:57.044 --> 33:59.212
Okay? Just stop.

33:59.247 --> 34:02.315
I don't need a lecture
on diversity right now.

34:02.350 --> 34:03.750
I'm not trying to lecture you.

34:03.784 --> 34:07.220
I know that disabled people are valuable

34:07.255 --> 34:09.121
and they have the right to exist.

34:09.156 --> 34:12.792
That doesn't mean that I'm
the guy to raise one of them.

34:12.826 --> 34:14.960
This will ruin my life.

34:14.995 --> 34:17.396
It will change your life.

34:17.429 --> 34:20.032
But it doesn't mean that it will ruin it.

34:20.065 --> 34:23.034
I think it would expand it.

34:23.069 --> 34:24.770
This is not helping.

34:24.804 --> 34:26.005
You're my brother.

34:26.039 --> 34:27.907
And I have to be able to tell you this.

34:27.940 --> 34:30.208
No, you don't!

34:30.243 --> 34:32.277
Do you think this is easy for me?

34:32.311 --> 34:35.513
Don't you think I know
how Mom and Dad would feel?

34:35.547 --> 34:38.616
I am making a rational choice.

34:38.650 --> 34:41.418
And I know that it's not the popular one.

34:41.453 --> 34:44.121
But it's our decision.

34:44.156 --> 34:47.058
What I need right now
is for you to back off.

34:49.360 --> 34:50.427
(Door closes)

34:55.027 --> 34:56.730
I'm so sorry.

34:56.833 --> 35:00.937
I just coun't handle her
talking about Bay like that.

35:01.138 --> 35:04.570
_

35:04.575 --> 35:07.276
So you lost one student.

35:07.311 --> 35:09.245
You still have other kids

35:09.279 --> 35:12.449
and freshmen coming in next semester.

35:16.250 --> 35:18.230
_

35:22.700 --> 35:27.190
_

35:27.191 --> 35:33.115
_

35:33.316 --> 35:39.775
_

35:39.976 --> 35:42.730
_

35:42.978 --> 35:44.412
Oh.

35:49.213 --> 35:51.735
_

35:53.254 --> 35:57.223
John and I would like
to cover the donation.

35:57.224 --> 35:59.999
_

36:02.229 --> 36:05.498
Our daughter loves this program,

36:05.532 --> 36:07.800
we love this program,

36:07.834 --> 36:10.536
and we need you running it.

36:16.207 --> 36:19.910
_

36:19.946 --> 36:22.380
Positive. How much?

36:28.888 --> 36:30.388
Mingo: Hey! Josh!

36:30.423 --> 36:31.923
Yo dude, wait up.

36:31.957 --> 36:33.558
Hey. I'm not with Daphne today.

36:33.592 --> 36:35.059
No, I know that. I've actually got

36:35.093 --> 36:36.895
a business proposition for you.

36:36.929 --> 36:38.329
Oh?

36:38.363 --> 36:41.197
Can you teach me A.L.S.?

36:41.232 --> 36:43.066
Lou Gehrig's disease?

36:43.100 --> 36:44.735
Ah. Got it. The other one.

36:44.769 --> 36:45.803
ASL.

36:45.837 --> 36:48.171
I'm like, a really fast
learner when I apply myself,

36:48.205 --> 36:49.940
or so said my fourth grade teacher.

36:49.974 --> 36:52.042
And I can pay you.

36:54.045 --> 36:56.813
- I'm open to it.
- Excellent.

36:56.847 --> 37:00.516
So do you just give me my name sign thing,

37:00.551 --> 37:03.018
or is there, like, an
elaborate ceremony involved?

37:12.495 --> 37:14.128
- Hi.
- Hey.

37:14.163 --> 37:16.465
I'm glad you decided to stay.

37:16.499 --> 37:18.099
Me too.

37:18.133 --> 37:21.342
Alvarez: Let us begin
by talking about time.

37:21.343 --> 37:22.607
_

37:22.607 --> 37:23.494
- _
- To say what time it is,

37:23.495 --> 37:25.895
- _
- we use the verb <i>ser</i>

37:25.899 --> 37:28.543
- _
- followed by the feminine article before the hour.

37:28.578 --> 37:29.850
For example,

37:29.851 --> 37:32.233
- _
-  to say it's 2:00 would be <i>son</i>

37:32.234 --> 37:34.485
- _
- las dos.

37:34.549 --> 37:37.017
And we can add minutes to the hour.

37:37.051 --> 37:39.353
- _
- <i>Son las dos y cinco.</i>

37:39.387 --> 37:41.655
- _
- It's two minutes past 5:00.

37:41.690 --> 37:44.758
Minutes can also be
subtracted from the hour.

37:44.793 --> 37:47.126
So for example, how would we say

37:47.160 --> 37:51.631
it's five minutes to 3:00?
<i>Son las tres menos cinco.</i>

37:52.633 --> 37:53.800
(Door opens)

37:55.135 --> 37:58.605
- Hey.
- Hi.

38:01.609 --> 38:02.742
(Sighs)

38:05.344 --> 38:08.814
I'm going to learn A.L.S.

38:10.216 --> 38:13.218
I keep doing that. Um... "A", "S", "L."

38:13.252 --> 38:14.285
(Stifled laugh)

38:14.320 --> 38:16.588
Rookie mistake.

38:16.623 --> 38:18.223
Mistake?

38:19.592 --> 38:22.159
Look at me, I'll be fluent in no time.

38:24.195 --> 38:27.698
I really, really appreciate this.

38:29.935 --> 38:33.504
I'm gonna keep making...

38:33.539 --> 38:35.573
and not just with sign language,

38:35.607 --> 38:39.609
but with saying really
stupid hearing person stuff.

38:41.078 --> 38:42.211
It's all right.

38:44.682 --> 38:46.917
And I will be more patient.

38:46.951 --> 38:48.217
I promise.

38:48.252 --> 38:50.319
Patient?

38:58.127 --> 38:59.327
(Both laugh)

39:00.730 --> 39:02.097
(Door opens)

39:05.936 --> 39:08.070
- Hey!
- Hey.

39:09.172 --> 39:12.640
- How's Melody?
- Good. Better.

39:12.675 --> 39:14.876
Turns out that a donor
dropped out for next semester.

39:14.910 --> 39:17.378
So I made a donation.

39:17.412 --> 39:19.881
- What?
- Oh, I'm sorry.

39:19.915 --> 39:21.916
I should've asked you but
I figured you'd be on board.

39:21.951 --> 39:26.187
It just feels so good putting
money where it's really needed.

39:26.221 --> 39:28.855
- How much?
- $50,000.

39:29.958 --> 39:32.726
It's a third of what we
ended up giving Buckner.

39:32.760 --> 39:35.028
And that's what we usually
donate to charity every year.

39:35.063 --> 39:37.097
So I just figured, you
know, put them together.

39:37.131 --> 39:39.265
You gave Melody $50,000?

39:39.300 --> 39:42.936
For the deaf program.
For Daphne's education.

39:42.971 --> 39:46.072
Honey, I thought you'd be on board.

39:46.106 --> 39:49.909
Yeah. Yeah. Okay.

39:49.943 --> 39:52.478
Honey, we have it.

39:52.512 --> 39:55.848
And part of being blessed
with all that we have

39:55.882 --> 39:58.084
is being able to share
it with others, right?

40:01.688 --> 40:04.022
- You worry too much.
