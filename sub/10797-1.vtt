00:18.500 --> 00:22.792
<i>Space... the final frontier.</i>

00:22.834 --> 00:27.458
<i>These are the voyages</i>

00:22.834 --> 00:27.458
<i>of the Starship</i> Enterprise.

00:27.500 --> 00:28.917
<i>Its continuing mission--</i>

00:28.959 --> 00:32.917
<i>to explore</i>

00:28.959 --> 00:32.917
<i>strange new worlds,</i>

00:32.959 --> 00:37.583
<i>to seek out new life</i>

00:32.959 --> 00:37.583
<i>and new civilizations,</i>

00:37.625 --> 00:41.250
<i>to boldly go</i>

00:37.625 --> 00:41.250
<i>where no one has gone before.</i>

02:26.458 --> 02:30.250
<i>Captain's Log,</i>

02:26.458 --> 02:30.250
<i>Stardate 41153.7:</i>

02:30.291 --> 02:33.667
<i>Our destination is</i>

02:30.291 --> 02:33.667
<i>planet Deneb IV</i>

02:33.709 --> 02:38.792
<i>beyond which lies the great,</i>

02:33.709 --> 02:38.792
<i>unexplored mass of the galaxy.</i>

02:42.375 --> 02:44.792
<i>My orders are</i>

02:42.375 --> 02:44.792
<i>to examine Farpoint,</i>

02:44.834 --> 02:48.291
<i>a starbase built there by</i>

02:44.834 --> 02:48.291
<i>the inhabitants of that world.</i>

02:48.333 --> 02:50.625
<i>Meanwhile, I am becoming</i>

02:48.333 --> 02:50.625
<i>better acquainted</i>

02:50.667 --> 02:51.959
<i>with my new command</i>

02:52.000 --> 02:55.333
<i>this Galaxy-class</i>

02:52.000 --> 02:55.333
<i>USS</i> Enterprise.

02:58.500 --> 03:02.125
<i>I am still somewhat in awe</i>

02:58.500 --> 03:02.125
<i>of its size and complexity.</i>

03:03.250 --> 03:05.500
<i>As for my crew,</i>

03:05.542 --> 03:07.166
<i>we are short</i>

03:05.542 --> 03:07.166
<i>in several key positions</i>

03:07.208 --> 03:09.583
<i>most notably,</i>

03:07.208 --> 03:09.583
<i>a first officer,</i>

03:09.625 --> 03:11.792
<i>but I am informed that</i>

03:09.625 --> 03:11.792
<i>a highly experienced man--</i>

03:11.834 --> 03:13.959
<i>one Commander</i>

03:11.834 --> 03:13.959
<i>William Riker--</i>

03:14.000 --> 03:16.000
<i>will be waiting</i>

03:14.000 --> 03:16.000
<i>to join the ship</i>

03:16.041 --> 03:17.959
<i>at our Deneb IV destination.</i>

03:18.000 --> 03:19.250
You will agree, Data,

03:19.291 --> 03:21.959
that Starfleet's orders

03:19.291 --> 03:21.959
are difficult.

03:22.000 --> 03:23.625
Difficult?

03:23.667 --> 03:26.041
Simply solve the mystery

03:23.667 --> 03:26.041
of Farpoint Station.

03:26.083 --> 03:27.875
As simple as that.

03:27.917 --> 03:30.125
Farpoint Station--

03:30.166 --> 03:33.000
even the name

03:30.166 --> 03:33.000
sounds mysterious.

03:33.041 --> 03:34.834
It's hardly simple,

03:33.041 --> 03:34.834
Data, to negotiate

03:34.875 --> 03:36.917
a friendly agreement

03:34.875 --> 03:36.917
for Starfleet to use the base

03:36.959 --> 03:39.166
while at the same time

03:36.959 --> 03:39.166
snoop around,

03:39.208 --> 03:42.000
finding out how and why

03:39.208 --> 03:42.000
the life-form there built it.

03:42.041 --> 03:43.333
Inquiry--

03:43.375 --> 03:46.417
the word... "snoop"?

03:46.458 --> 03:48.458
Data, how can you

03:46.458 --> 03:48.458
be programmed

03:48.500 --> 03:50.917
as a virtual encyclopedia

03:48.500 --> 03:50.917
of human information

03:50.959 --> 03:53.417
without knowing

03:50.959 --> 03:53.417
a simple word like snoop?

03:54.875 --> 03:56.375
A possibility--

03:56.417 --> 03:59.166
a kind of human behavior

03:56.417 --> 03:59.166
I was not designed to emulate.

03:59.208 --> 04:01.875
It means, uh...

04:01.917 --> 04:03.959
to, uh...

04:04.000 --> 04:06.291
spy, to sneak.

04:06.333 --> 04:09.875
Ah! To seek covertly, to go

04:06.333 --> 04:09.875
stealthily, to slink, slither...

04:09.917 --> 04:11.166
Exactly, yes.

04:11.208 --> 04:12.917
Glide, creep, skulk,

04:11.208 --> 04:12.917
pussyfoot, gum...

04:12.959 --> 04:13.959
Yes.

04:14.000 --> 04:15.250
...shoe.

04:15.291 --> 04:16.667
Captain...

04:16.709 --> 04:20.542
I'm sensing a...

04:20.583 --> 04:23.875
a powerful mind.

04:23.917 --> 04:27.000
(<i> alarm blaring</i> )

04:27.041 --> 04:29.917
Something strange on

04:27.041 --> 04:29.917
this detector circuit.

04:36.542 --> 04:39.375
(<i> electrical crackling</i> )

04:40.792 --> 04:43.083
DATA:

04:40.792 --> 04:43.083
It registers as solid, Captain.

04:43.125 --> 04:45.709
Or an incredibly

04:43.125 --> 04:45.709
powerful force field

04:45.750 --> 04:47.959
but if we collide with either,

04:45.750 --> 04:47.959
it could be very...

04:48.000 --> 04:49.250
Shut off that damn noise!

04:49.291 --> 04:51.208
Go to yellow alert!

04:51.250 --> 04:53.750
(<i> alarm stops</i> )

04:59.792 --> 05:01.917
Shields and deflectors up, sir.

05:10.875 --> 05:13.500
(<i> electrical crackling</i> )

05:17.542 --> 05:19.000
Reverse power-- full stop!

05:19.041 --> 05:21.250
Controls at full stop, sir.

05:32.500 --> 05:34.583
Now reading full stop, sir.

05:46.083 --> 05:48.291
Thou art notified

05:46.083 --> 05:48.291
that thy kind

05:48.333 --> 05:51.583
hath infiltrated the galaxy

05:48.333 --> 05:51.583
too far already.

05:51.625 --> 05:52.917
Thou art directed to return

05:52.959 --> 05:55.208
to thine own solar system

05:52.959 --> 05:55.208
immediately.

05:57.125 --> 06:00.667
That's quite a directive.

06:00.709 --> 06:03.083
Would you mind identifying

06:00.709 --> 06:03.083
what you are?

06:03.125 --> 06:05.333
We call ourselves the "Q."

06:05.375 --> 06:07.834
Or thou mayest call me that.

06:07.875 --> 06:10.208
It's all much the same thing.

06:15.041 --> 06:18.250
I present myself to thee

06:15.041 --> 06:18.250
as a fellow ship captain

06:18.291 --> 06:20.875
that thou mayest

06:18.291 --> 06:20.875
better understand me.

06:20.917 --> 06:22.458
Go back whence

06:20.917 --> 06:22.458
thou camest.

06:22.500 --> 06:23.667
Stay where thou art.

06:33.250 --> 06:34.709
Data, call medics.

06:34.750 --> 06:36.834
He's frozen!

06:36.875 --> 06:40.125
He would not have injured you.

06:40.166 --> 06:42.291
Do you recognize this--

06:40.166 --> 06:42.291
the stun setting?

06:42.333 --> 06:45.625
Knowing humans

06:42.333 --> 06:45.625
as thou dost, Captain,

06:45.667 --> 06:48.000
wouldst thou be

06:45.667 --> 06:48.000
captured helpless by them?

06:48.041 --> 06:50.792
Now, go back,

06:50.834 --> 06:53.458
or thou shalt

06:50.834 --> 06:53.458
most certainly die.

07:05.041 --> 07:07.208
<i>Captain's Log,</i>

07:05.041 --> 07:07.208
<i>supplementary:</i>

07:07.250 --> 07:09.250
<i>The frozen form</i>

07:07.250 --> 07:09.250
<i>of Lieutenant Torres</i>

07:09.291 --> 07:11.125
<i>has been rushed to Sick Bay.</i>

07:11.166 --> 07:13.500
<i>The question now</i>

07:11.166 --> 07:13.500
<i>is the incredible power</i>

07:13.542 --> 07:14.792
<i>of the Q being.</i>

07:14.834 --> 07:17.542
<i>Do we dare oppose it?</i>

07:17.583 --> 07:19.083
Captain,

07:19.125 --> 07:22.458
thy little centuries

07:19.125 --> 07:22.458
go by so rapidly.

07:22.500 --> 07:26.417
Perhaps thou will

07:22.500 --> 07:26.417
better understand<i> this.</i>

07:30.583 --> 07:33.333
Actually, the issue

07:30.583 --> 07:33.333
at stake is patriotism.

07:33.375 --> 07:36.083
You must return to your world

07:33.375 --> 07:36.083
and put an end to the Commies.

07:36.125 --> 07:38.041
All it takes are

07:36.125 --> 07:38.041
a few good men.

07:38.083 --> 07:39.333
What?

07:39.375 --> 07:41.959
That nonsense

07:39.375 --> 07:41.959
is centuries behind us.

07:42.000 --> 07:43.917
But you can't deny

07:42.000 --> 07:43.917
that you're still a dangerous,

07:43.959 --> 07:45.542
savage child race.

07:45.583 --> 07:47.083
Most certainly I deny it.

07:47.125 --> 07:49.083
I agree we still were

07:49.125 --> 07:53.875
when humans wore costumes

07:49.125 --> 07:53.875
like that 400 years ago.

07:53.917 --> 07:55.750
At which time,

07:53.917 --> 07:55.750
you slaughtered millions

07:55.792 --> 07:57.709
in silly arguments

07:55.792 --> 07:57.709
about how to divide

07:57.750 --> 07:59.542
the resources

07:57.750 --> 07:59.542
of your little world.

07:59.583 --> 08:02.125
And 400 years before that,

07:59.583 --> 08:02.125
you were murdering each other

08:02.166 --> 08:04.458
in quarrels

08:02.166 --> 08:04.458
over tribal god images.

08:04.500 --> 08:06.375
Since then,

08:04.500 --> 08:06.375
there are no indications

08:06.417 --> 08:07.834
that humans will ever change.

08:07.875 --> 08:11.208
But even when we wore

08:07.875 --> 08:11.208
costumes like that

08:11.250 --> 08:13.333
we'd already started

08:11.250 --> 08:13.333
to make rapid progress.

08:13.375 --> 08:16.291
Oh, yeah? Do you want

08:13.375 --> 08:16.291
to review your rapid progress?

08:21.792 --> 08:23.417
Rapid progress--

08:23.458 --> 08:28.041
where humans learned to control

08:23.458 --> 08:28.041
their military with drugs.

08:28.083 --> 08:30.125
Sir, Sick Bay reports

08:30.166 --> 08:32.375
Lieutenant Torres'

08:30.166 --> 08:32.375
condition is better.

08:32.417 --> 08:36.375
Oh, concern for one's

08:32.417 --> 08:36.375
fellow comrade.

08:36.417 --> 08:38.000
How touching.

08:38.041 --> 08:39.625
And now,

08:38.041 --> 08:39.625
a personal request, sir.

08:39.667 --> 08:41.250
Permission to clean up

08:39.667 --> 08:41.250
the Bridge.

08:41.291 --> 08:42.875
Lieutenant Worf is right, sir.

08:42.917 --> 08:44.709
As security chief, I can't

08:42.917 --> 08:44.709
just stand here and let...

08:44.750 --> 08:46.542
Yes, you can,

08:44.750 --> 08:46.542
Lieutenant Yar.

08:49.166 --> 08:51.500
Oh, better.

08:51.542 --> 08:54.583
Then later, on finally

08:51.542 --> 08:54.583
reaching deep space,

08:54.625 --> 08:57.291
humans of course found enemies

08:54.625 --> 08:57.291
to fight out there, too.

08:57.333 --> 08:59.333
And to broaden

08:57.333 --> 08:59.333
those struggles,

08:59.375 --> 09:02.458
you again found allies

08:59.375 --> 09:02.458
for still more murdering.

09:02.500 --> 09:06.333
The same old story

09:02.500 --> 09:06.333
all over again.

09:06.375 --> 09:10.333
No. The same old story

09:06.375 --> 09:10.333
is the one we're meeting now--

09:10.375 --> 09:12.125
self-righteous life-forms

09:12.166 --> 09:14.458
who are eager not to learn,

09:14.500 --> 09:15.959
but to prosecute to judge

09:16.000 --> 09:18.458
anything they don't understand

09:16.000 --> 09:18.458
or can't tolerate.

09:18.500 --> 09:21.792
What an interesting idea.

09:18.500 --> 09:21.792
Prosecute and judge.

09:21.834 --> 09:25.125
Suppose it turns out

09:21.834 --> 09:25.125
we understand you humans

09:21.834 --> 09:25.125
only too well.

09:25.166 --> 09:29.166
We've no fear of what the true

09:25.166 --> 09:29.166
facts about us will reveal.

09:29.208 --> 09:30.250
Facts about you?

09:30.291 --> 09:32.125
Splendid, splendid, Captain.

09:32.166 --> 09:35.250
You're a veritable fountain

09:32.166 --> 09:35.250
of good ideas.

09:35.291 --> 09:38.834
There are preparations to make,

09:35.291 --> 09:38.834
but when we next meet, Captain,

09:38.875 --> 09:41.834
we'll proceed

09:38.875 --> 09:41.834
exactly as you suggest.

09:46.959 --> 09:50.792
Sir, respectfully submit

09:46.959 --> 09:50.792
our only choice is to fight.

09:50.834 --> 09:53.250
Fight or try

09:50.834 --> 09:53.250
to escape.

09:53.291 --> 09:55.250
Sense anything, Commander?

09:55.291 --> 09:57.125
Its mind is

09:55.291 --> 09:57.125
much too powerful.

09:57.166 --> 09:59.458
Recommend

09:57.166 --> 09:59.458
we avoid contact.

10:03.667 --> 10:05.291
From this point,

10:03.667 --> 10:05.291
no station aboard--

10:05.333 --> 10:07.083
repeat-- no station

10:05.333 --> 10:07.083
for any reason

10:07.125 --> 10:09.208
will make use of transmitted

10:07.125 --> 10:09.208
signals or intercom.

10:10.625 --> 10:12.959
We'll try and take them

10:10.625 --> 10:12.959
by surprise.

10:13.000 --> 10:15.792
Let's see what this

10:13.000 --> 10:15.792
Galaxy-class starship can do.

10:15.834 --> 10:19.500
Lieutenant, inform

10:15.834 --> 10:19.500
Engine Room to prepare for

10:15.834 --> 10:19.500
maximum acceleration.

10:19.542 --> 10:21.291
Aye, sir.

10:19.542 --> 10:21.291
Records search, Data.

10:21.333 --> 10:24.250
Results of detaching saucer

10:21.333 --> 10:24.250
section at high warp velocity.

10:25.583 --> 10:27.750
Inadvisable at

10:25.583 --> 10:27.750
any warp speed, sir.

10:27.792 --> 10:29.667
Search theoretical.

10:31.417 --> 10:33.125
It is possible,

10:33.166 --> 10:35.417
but absolutely

10:33.166 --> 10:35.417
no margin for error.

10:35.458 --> 10:37.959
Using printout only,

10:35.458 --> 10:37.959
notify all decks

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
to prepare for maximum

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
acceleration.

10:40.041 --> 10:42.625
Now hear this. Maximum,

10:40.041 --> 10:42.625
you're entitled to know,

10:42.667 --> 10:44.125
means that we'll be

10:42.667 --> 10:44.125
pushing our engines

10:44.166 --> 10:45.667
well beyond safety limits.

10:45.709 --> 10:49.208
Our hope is to surprise

10:45.709 --> 10:49.208
whatever that is out there--

10:49.250 --> 10:51.166
try and outrun it.

10:51.208 --> 10:54.000
Our only other option

10:54.041 --> 10:56.333
is to tuck tail

10:54.041 --> 10:56.333
between our legs

10:56.375 --> 10:59.583
and return to Earth

10:56.375 --> 10:59.583
as they demand.

11:20.500 --> 11:22.291
Engine Room ready, sir.

11:22.333 --> 11:25.000
The board shows green,

11:22.333 --> 11:25.000
Captain-- all go.

11:25.041 --> 11:26.917
Stand by.

11:26.959 --> 11:29.166
Engage.

11:59.667 --> 12:02.208
Velocity warp 9.2.

12:03.917 --> 12:06.291
Heading 3-5-1,

12:03.917 --> 12:06.291
mark 11, sir.

12:06.333 --> 12:07.834
Steady on that.

12:07.875 --> 12:11.000
The hostile is now giving chase,

12:07.875 --> 12:11.000
sir, accelerating fast.

12:15.375 --> 12:17.917
We're now at warp 9.3, sir,

12:17.959 --> 12:19.750
which takes us

12:17.959 --> 12:19.750
past the red line.

12:19.792 --> 12:21.291
PICARD:

12:19.792 --> 12:21.291
Continue accelerating.

12:21.333 --> 12:23.500
Counselor, at this point,

12:23.542 --> 12:26.000
I'm open to guesses

12:23.542 --> 12:26.000
about what we've just met.

12:26.041 --> 12:28.792
It felt like

12:26.041 --> 12:28.792
something beyond

12:28.834 --> 12:30.709
what we'd consider

12:28.834 --> 12:30.709
a life-form.

12:30.750 --> 12:32.208
Beyond?

12:32.250 --> 12:33.917
Very, very

12:32.250 --> 12:33.917
advanced, sir,

12:33.959 --> 12:38.458
or certainly very,

12:33.959 --> 12:38.458
very... different.

12:38.500 --> 12:40.041
WORF:

12:38.500 --> 12:40.041
We're at 9.4, sir.

12:40.083 --> 12:42.375
Hostile is now beginning

12:40.083 --> 12:42.375
to overtake us, sir.

12:42.417 --> 12:43.750
Are you sure?

12:43.792 --> 12:46.291
Hostile's velocity

12:43.792 --> 12:46.291
is already warp 9.6, sir.

12:46.333 --> 12:47.959
Shall I put them

12:46.333 --> 12:47.959
on the main viewer?

12:48.000 --> 12:50.083
Reverse angle.

12:54.458 --> 12:56.542
Magnifying

12:54.458 --> 12:56.542
viewer image.

13:00.667 --> 13:03.291
Hostile's velocity

13:00.667 --> 13:03.291
is 9.7, sir.

13:03.333 --> 13:05.875
PICARD:

13:03.333 --> 13:05.875
Worf, inform the Engine Room

13:03.333 --> 13:05.875
that we need more.

13:05.917 --> 13:07.458
Engine Room attempting

13:05.917 --> 13:07.458
to comply, sir,

13:07.500 --> 13:08.792
but they caution us...

13:08.834 --> 13:10.000
Go to yellow alert.

13:10.041 --> 13:11.500
Arm aft photon torpedoes.

13:11.542 --> 13:12.542
Place them on ready status.

13:12.583 --> 13:14.166
Torpedoes to ready, sir.

13:16.458 --> 13:18.917
Hostile now

13:16.458 --> 13:18.917
at warp 9.8, sir.

13:18.959 --> 13:21.375
Our velocity is only 9.5, sir.

13:21.417 --> 13:22.917
DATA:

13:21.417 --> 13:22.917
Projection, sir.

13:22.959 --> 13:26.291
We may be able to

13:22.959 --> 13:26.291
match hostile's 9.8, sir...

13:27.417 --> 13:29.583
but at extreme risk.

13:33.834 --> 13:36.375
Now reading the hostile

13:33.834 --> 13:36.375
at warp 9.9, sir.

13:36.417 --> 13:37.959
Now hear this.

13:38.000 --> 13:42.250
Printout message, urgent,

13:38.000 --> 13:42.250
all stations on all decks:

13:42.291 --> 13:45.208
prepare for

13:42.291 --> 13:45.208
emergency saucer-sep.

13:49.375 --> 13:52.041
You will command

13:49.375 --> 13:52.041
the saucer section, Lieutenant.

13:55.041 --> 13:56.709
I am a Klingon, sir.

13:56.750 --> 13:59.417
For me to seek escape when

13:56.750 --> 13:59.417
my Captain goes into battle...

13:59.458 --> 14:02.166
You are a Starfleet officer,

13:59.458 --> 14:02.166
Lieutenant.

14:03.250 --> 14:05.208
Aye, sir.

14:05.250 --> 14:07.291
Make the mark, Data.

14:21.083 --> 14:24.083
Note in ship's log

14:21.083 --> 14:24.083
that at this startime,

14:24.125 --> 14:28.208
I'm transferring command

14:24.125 --> 14:28.208
to the Battle Bridge.

14:33.792 --> 14:37.792
<i>Captain's Log,</i>

14:33.792 --> 14:37.792
<i>Stardate 41153.7:</i>

14:37.834 --> 14:40.208

14:40.250 --> 14:43.041

14:43.083 --> 14:46.417
<i>while the vessel's stardrive,</i>

14:46.458 --> 14:48.583
<i>containing the Battle Bridge</i>

14:46.458 --> 14:48.583
<i>and main armaments,</i>

14:48.625 --> 14:50.917

14:50.959 --> 14:53.458
<i>the mystery that</i>

14:50.959 --> 14:53.458
<i>is threatening us.</i>

15:05.458 --> 15:07.500
Lieutenant, your

15:05.458 --> 15:07.500
torpedoes must detonate

15:07.542 --> 15:08.917
close enough

15:07.542 --> 15:08.917
to the hostile

15:08.959 --> 15:10.417
to blind it the

15:08.959 --> 15:10.417
moment we separate.

15:10.458 --> 15:12.000
Understood, sir.

15:12.041 --> 15:13.667
All decks

15:12.041 --> 15:13.667
acknowledging, sir.

15:13.709 --> 15:15.333
Worf, this is the Captain.

15:15.375 --> 15:16.959
At the moment of separation,

15:17.000 --> 15:18.667
we will reverse power

15:17.000 --> 15:18.667
just enough

15:18.709 --> 15:21.291
to get your saucer section

15:18.709 --> 15:21.291
out ahead and clear of us.

15:21.333 --> 15:22.500
Understood, Captain.

15:22.542 --> 15:24.959
Torpedoes away, sir.

15:35.709 --> 15:37.500
Begin countdown.

15:38.834 --> 15:39.750
Mark.

15:39.792 --> 15:42.083
Starship separation...

15:42.125 --> 15:45.417
six, five, four,

15:45.458 --> 15:48.875
three, two, one.

16:32.458 --> 16:35.917
Separation successful, sir.

17:13.333 --> 17:15.375
Torpedoes have

17:13.333 --> 17:15.375
detonated, sir.

17:15.417 --> 17:16.917
Let's come to a stop.

17:16.959 --> 17:18.625
Reverse power.

17:18.667 --> 17:20.917
Reverse power.

17:20.959 --> 17:22.959
Decelerating.

17:27.000 --> 17:28.458
Dead stop.

17:39.458 --> 17:41.875
We'll hold this position

17:41.917 --> 17:43.917
and wait for them.

17:43.959 --> 17:45.875
That will bring them here

17:43.959 --> 17:45.875
in just minutes, sir.

17:46.917 --> 17:48.291
(<i> sighs</i> )

17:48.333 --> 17:50.000
Will we make a fight of it,

17:48.333 --> 17:50.000
Captain?

17:50.041 --> 17:52.583
If we can at least damage

17:50.041 --> 17:52.583
their ship, we have a chance --

17:52.625 --> 17:54.792
Lieutenant, are you recommending

17:54.834 --> 17:58.500
that we fight a life-form

17:54.834 --> 17:58.500
that can do all those things?

18:02.083 --> 18:04.041
I'd like to hear your advice.

18:10.208 --> 18:13.125
I spoke before

18:10.208 --> 18:13.125
I thought, sir.

18:13.166 --> 18:15.375
We should look for some way

18:13.166 --> 18:15.375
to distract them

18:15.417 --> 18:17.542
from going after

18:15.417 --> 18:17.542
the saucer.

18:17.583 --> 18:19.917
O'BRIEN:

18:17.583 --> 18:19.917
All forward

18:17.583 --> 18:19.917
motion stopped, sir.

18:19.959 --> 18:21.709
Thank you, Conn.

18:32.166 --> 18:34.041
Commander,

18:32.166 --> 18:34.041
signal the following

18:34.083 --> 18:37.750
in all languages

18:34.083 --> 18:37.750
and on all frequencies:

18:37.792 --> 18:39.417
We surrender.

18:39.458 --> 18:43.417
State that we are not asking

18:39.458 --> 18:43.417
for any terms or conditions.

18:43.458 --> 18:45.792
Aye, sir.

18:45.834 --> 18:49.417
All language forms

18:45.834 --> 18:49.417
and frequencies.

19:09.959 --> 19:13.834
(<i> laughter and jeering</i> )

19:28.625 --> 19:32.542
(<i> laughing and talking</i> )

19:36.583 --> 19:39.208
(<i> machine gun fire</i> )

19:42.625 --> 19:45.500
The prisoners will

19:42.625 --> 19:45.500
<i>all</i> stand!

19:57.291 --> 19:59.834
Historically intriguing,

19:57.291 --> 19:59.834
Captain.

19:59.875 --> 20:03.500
Very, very accurate.

20:03.542 --> 20:05.542
Mid-21st century.

20:05.583 --> 20:08.000
The post-atomic horror.

20:11.250 --> 20:13.083
BAILIFF:

20:11.250 --> 20:13.083
All present...

20:13.125 --> 20:14.417
stand and make

20:14.458 --> 20:19.000
respectful attention

20:14.458 --> 20:19.000
to honored judge!

20:24.709 --> 20:26.000
Careful, sir.

20:26.041 --> 20:28.250
This is not an illusion

20:26.041 --> 20:28.250
or a dream.

20:28.291 --> 20:31.458
But these courts

20:28.291 --> 20:31.458
belong in the past.

20:31.500 --> 20:34.000
TROI:

20:31.500 --> 20:34.000
I don't understand, either

20:34.041 --> 20:35.792
but this is real.

20:35.834 --> 20:38.208
Get to your

20:35.834 --> 20:38.208
feet, criminals!

21:06.500 --> 21:09.417
At least we're acquainted

21:06.500 --> 21:09.417
with the judge, Captain.

21:42.375 --> 21:44.500
Attention!

21:44.542 --> 21:46.458
On your feet! Attention!

21:57.709 --> 21:59.333
You are out of order!

22:17.208 --> 22:20.500
The prisoners

22:17.208 --> 22:20.500
will not be harmed...

22:23.125 --> 22:26.083
...until they're found guilty.

22:28.125 --> 22:29.542
Dispose of that.

22:38.083 --> 22:41.250
Can we assume you mean

22:38.083 --> 22:41.250
this will be a fair trial?

22:41.291 --> 22:44.208
Yes, absolutely equitable.

22:51.125 --> 22:53.709
BAILIFF:

22:51.125 --> 22:53.709
Before this gracious court

22:53.750 --> 22:56.375
now appear these prisoners

22:56.417 --> 22:59.917
to answer for the multiple

22:56.417 --> 22:59.917
and grievous savageries

22:59.959 --> 23:02.125
of the species.

23:02.166 --> 23:04.750
How plead you, criminal?

23:04.792 --> 23:06.875
If I may, Captain...

23:09.208 --> 23:10.917
Objection, Your Honor.

23:10.959 --> 23:14.083
In the year 2036,

23:10.959 --> 23:14.083
the new United Nations

23:14.125 --> 23:16.041
declared that no Earth

23:14.125 --> 23:16.041
citizen could be made

23:16.083 --> 23:18.959
to answer for the crimes

23:16.083 --> 23:18.959
of his race or forbears.

23:19.000 --> 23:20.709
Objection denied.

23:20.750 --> 23:23.750
This is a court

23:20.750 --> 23:23.750
of the year 2079,

23:23.792 --> 23:26.083
by which time

23:23.792 --> 23:26.083
more rapid progress

23:26.125 --> 23:29.500
had caused all "United Earth"

23:26.125 --> 23:29.500
nonsense to be abolished.

23:29.542 --> 23:30.834
Tasha, no!

23:30.875 --> 23:33.333
I must, because

23:30.875 --> 23:33.333
I grew up in a world

23:33.375 --> 23:35.959
that allowed things

23:33.375 --> 23:35.959
like this court,

23:36.000 --> 23:40.041
and it was people like these

23:36.000 --> 23:40.041
that saved me from it.

23:40.083 --> 23:41.792
This so-called court

23:41.834 --> 23:43.875
should get down on its knees

23:43.917 --> 23:46.000
to what Starfleet is,

23:46.041 --> 23:48.125
what it represents.

24:05.959 --> 24:08.041
You barbarian!

24:08.083 --> 24:09.583
This woman...

24:09.625 --> 24:11.417
Criminals keep silence!

24:11.458 --> 24:13.500
You've got a lot to

24:11.458 --> 24:13.500
learn about humans

24:13.542 --> 24:16.542
if you think you can torture us

24:13.542 --> 24:16.542
or frighten us into silence.

24:16.583 --> 24:18.166
Will she live?

24:18.208 --> 24:19.834
Uncertain.

24:19.875 --> 24:22.333
When he froze Lieutenant

24:19.875 --> 24:22.333
Torres on the Bridge

24:22.375 --> 24:24.083
we had our Sick Bay

24:22.375 --> 24:24.083
to help thaw him out.

24:24.125 --> 24:26.583
You will answer

24:24.125 --> 24:26.583
the charges, criminal.

24:26.625 --> 24:28.625
Or what? Or this?

24:29.625 --> 24:32.083
Or death? Or worse?

24:32.125 --> 24:35.625
You promised the prisoners

24:32.125 --> 24:35.625
will not be harmed.

24:35.667 --> 24:38.458
We plead nothing so long as

24:35.667 --> 24:38.458
you break your own rules.

24:38.500 --> 24:41.208
I suggest

24:38.500 --> 24:41.208
you center your attention

24:41.250 --> 24:42.792
on this trial, Captain.

24:42.834 --> 24:44.500
It may be your only hope.

24:44.542 --> 24:47.166
And I suggest you are now

24:44.542 --> 24:47.166
having second thoughts about it.

24:47.208 --> 24:49.458
You are considering that

24:47.208 --> 24:49.458
if you conduct a fair trial,

24:49.500 --> 24:52.417
which was your promise,

24:49.500 --> 24:52.417
you may lose.

24:52.458 --> 24:53.709
Lose?

24:53.750 --> 24:56.375
Yes, even though

24:53.750 --> 24:56.375
you're judge and prosecutor.

24:56.417 --> 24:58.667
And jury.

24:58.709 --> 25:01.375
Accepted...

25:01.417 --> 25:03.083
so long as you keep

25:01.417 --> 25:03.083
to your agreement,

25:03.125 --> 25:05.625
and assaulting a prisoner

25:03.125 --> 25:05.625
is hardly a fair trial!

25:05.667 --> 25:08.959
This is a merciful court.

25:27.125 --> 25:30.375
(<i> bell tolling</i> )

25:35.875 --> 25:37.750
Silence!

25:40.667 --> 25:42.625
Continuing

25:40.667 --> 25:42.625
these proceedings,

25:42.667 --> 25:45.750
I must caution you that legal

25:42.667 --> 25:45.750
trickery is not permitted.

25:45.792 --> 25:49.125
This is a

25:45.792 --> 25:49.125
court of fact.

25:45.792 --> 25:49.125
...court of fact!

25:49.166 --> 25:52.875
We humans know our past

25:49.166 --> 25:52.875
even when we're ashamed of it.

25:52.917 --> 25:56.041
I recognize this court system

25:56.083 --> 25:59.125
as the one that agreed

25:56.083 --> 25:59.125
with that line from Shakespeare:

25:59.166 --> 26:01.875
"Kill all the lawyers."

25:59.166 --> 26:01.875
Which was done.

26:01.917 --> 26:04.750
Leading to the rule

26:01.917 --> 26:04.750
guilty until proven innocent.

26:04.792 --> 26:08.542
Of course. Bringing the innocent

26:04.792 --> 26:08.542
to trial would be unfair.

26:08.583 --> 26:10.250
You will now answer

26:08.583 --> 26:10.250
to the charge

26:10.291 --> 26:13.166
of being a grievously

26:10.291 --> 26:13.166
savage race.

26:13.208 --> 26:15.333
Grievously savage

26:13.208 --> 26:15.333
could mean anything.

26:15.375 --> 26:18.000
I will answer

26:15.375 --> 26:18.000
only specific charges.

26:18.041 --> 26:20.166
Are you certain you want

26:18.041 --> 26:20.166
a full disclosure

26:20.208 --> 26:22.000
of human ugliness?

26:22.041 --> 26:24.291
So be it, fool.

26:24.333 --> 26:27.166
Present the charges!

26:27.208 --> 26:30.792
Criminal, you will read

26:27.208 --> 26:30.792
the charges to the court.

26:45.291 --> 26:48.250
I see no charges

26:45.291 --> 26:48.250
against<i> us,</i> Your Honor.

26:53.959 --> 26:56.333
You are out of order.

27:07.959 --> 27:10.542
Soldiers, you will

27:07.959 --> 27:10.542
press those triggers

27:10.583 --> 27:14.125
if this criminal answers

27:10.583 --> 27:14.125
with any word other than guilty.

27:29.375 --> 27:32.333
Criminal, how plead you?

27:36.250 --> 27:39.041
Guilty...

27:45.125 --> 27:47.417
...provisionally.

27:48.542 --> 27:51.166
The court will hear

27:48.542 --> 27:51.166
the provision.

27:53.375 --> 27:54.959
We question

27:53.375 --> 27:54.959
whether this court

27:55.000 --> 27:57.083
is abiding by its own

27:55.000 --> 27:57.083
trial instructions.

27:57.125 --> 27:59.750
Have I your permission

27:57.125 --> 27:59.750
to have Commander Data

27:57.125 --> 27:59.750
repeat the record?

27:59.792 --> 28:01.417
There will be no

27:59.792 --> 28:01.417
legal trickery.

28:01.458 --> 28:03.166
These will be

28:01.458 --> 28:03.166
your own words, Your Honor.

28:03.208 --> 28:06.125
What exactly followed

28:03.208 --> 28:06.125
His Honor's statement

28:06.166 --> 28:07.959
that the prisoners

28:06.166 --> 28:07.959
will not be harmed?

28:08.000 --> 28:09.792
Yes, sir.

28:09.834 --> 28:12.208
The Captain had asked

28:09.834 --> 28:12.208
the question

28:12.250 --> 28:16.208
(<i> in Picard's voice</i> ):

28:12.250 --> 28:16.208
"Can we assume you mean

28:12.250 --> 28:16.208
this will be a fair trial?"

28:18.083 --> 28:20.458
And in reply,

28:18.083 --> 28:20.458
the judge stated,

28:20.500 --> 28:23.792
(<i> in Q's voice</i> ):

28:20.500 --> 28:23.792
"Yes, absolutely equitable."

28:23.834 --> 28:27.834
Irrelevant testimony,

28:23.834 --> 28:27.834
entirely irrelevant.

28:29.625 --> 28:31.625
All right.

28:33.000 --> 28:35.125
We agree there is evidence

28:35.166 --> 28:37.166
to support

28:35.166 --> 28:37.166
the court's contention

28:37.208 --> 28:39.000
that humans have been savage.

28:40.917 --> 28:44.000
Therefore, I say test us.

28:44.041 --> 28:46.875
Test whether this is

28:44.041 --> 28:46.875
presently true of humans.

28:46.917 --> 28:50.166
I see, I see.

28:50.208 --> 28:53.458
And so, you petition the court

28:50.208 --> 28:53.458
to accept you and your comrades

28:53.500 --> 28:55.542
as proof of what

28:53.500 --> 28:55.542
humanity has become?

28:55.583 --> 28:58.917
There must be many ways

28:55.583 --> 28:58.917
we can be tested.

28:58.959 --> 29:00.875
We have a long mission

28:58.959 --> 29:00.875
ahead of us.

29:00.917 --> 29:03.542
Another brilliant

29:00.917 --> 29:03.542
suggestion, Captain,

29:03.583 --> 29:06.875
but your test hardly

29:03.583 --> 29:06.875
requires a long mission.

29:06.917 --> 29:10.583
Your immediate destination

29:06.917 --> 29:10.583
offers far more challenge

29:10.625 --> 29:12.792
than you can

29:10.625 --> 29:12.792
possibly imagine.

29:12.834 --> 29:14.917
Yes,

29:14.959 --> 29:19.083
this Farpoint Station

29:14.959 --> 29:19.083
will be an excellent test.

29:21.083 --> 29:24.667
All present,

29:21.083 --> 29:24.667
respectfully stand.

29:27.583 --> 29:29.458
This court is adjourned

29:29.500 --> 29:32.083
to allow the criminals

29:29.500 --> 29:32.083
to be tested.

29:33.792 --> 29:37.417
This honorable court

29:33.792 --> 29:37.417
is adjourned.

29:40.917 --> 29:42.417
Stand respectfully.

29:57.834 --> 30:00.542
Captain, you may find

29:57.834 --> 30:00.542
that you are not

30:00.583 --> 30:04.166
nearly clever enough to deal

30:00.583 --> 30:04.166
with what lies ahead for you.

30:04.208 --> 30:08.917
<i>It may have been better</i>

30:04.208 --> 30:08.917
<i>to accept sentence here.</i>

30:24.458 --> 30:26.917
What is present course, Conn?

30:26.959 --> 30:29.125
It's what it's been

30:26.959 --> 30:29.125
all along, sir--

30:29.166 --> 30:31.667
direct heading

30:29.166 --> 30:31.667
to Farpoint Station.

30:32.917 --> 30:35.250
Confirmed.

30:32.917 --> 30:35.250
We are on that heading, sir.

30:35.291 --> 30:37.667
Do you know anything

30:35.291 --> 30:37.667
about Farpoint Station, sir?

30:37.709 --> 30:39.667
It sounds like

30:37.709 --> 30:39.667
a fairly dull place.

30:39.709 --> 30:43.250
We've heard that we may

30:39.709 --> 30:43.250
find it rather interesting.

30:52.709 --> 30:55.834
<i>Personal Log,</i>

30:52.709 --> 30:55.834
<i>Commander William Riker,</i>

30:55.875 --> 30:58.750
<i>Stardate 41153.7:</i>

30:58.792 --> 31:02.542
<i>The USS</i> Hood<i> has dropped me</i>

30:58.792 --> 31:02.542
<i>off at Farpoint Station</i>

31:02.583 --> 31:05.792
<i>where I await the arrival</i>

31:02.583 --> 31:05.792
<i>of the new USS</i> Enterprise

31:05.834 --> 31:08.333
<i>to which I have been assigned</i>

31:05.834 --> 31:08.333
<i>as first officer.</i>

31:08.375 --> 31:10.291
<i>Meanwhile,</i>

31:08.375 --> 31:10.291
<i>I've been asked to visit</i>

31:10.333 --> 31:13.458
<i>the Farpoint administrator's</i>

31:10.333 --> 31:13.458
<i>office in the old city.</i>

31:14.792 --> 31:17.417
Ah, Commander Riker,

31:14.792 --> 31:17.417
I thought you'd want to know

31:17.458 --> 31:19.333
we've still no word

31:17.458 --> 31:19.333
from your vessel.

31:19.375 --> 31:21.458
I trust we've made your

31:19.375 --> 31:21.458
waiting comfortable?

31:21.500 --> 31:24.041
Luxurious is more like it.

31:24.083 --> 31:26.083
Good.

31:26.125 --> 31:28.041
Good.

31:28.083 --> 31:30.959
Would I seem ungrateful

31:28.083 --> 31:30.959
if I asked for some information?

31:31.000 --> 31:32.250
Anything.

31:32.291 --> 31:34.500
Fascinating

31:32.291 --> 31:34.500
the advanced materials used

31:34.542 --> 31:36.834
in constructing

31:34.542 --> 31:36.834
this space station.

31:36.875 --> 31:39.458
Your energy surplus must be

31:36.875 --> 31:39.458
as abundant as I've heard.

31:39.500 --> 31:42.583
Geothermal energy is one of the

31:39.500 --> 31:42.583
great blessings of this planet.

31:42.625 --> 31:44.959
I'll have all the details

31:42.625 --> 31:44.959
of that sent to your quarters.

31:45.000 --> 31:48.583
Thank you, but it still

31:45.000 --> 31:48.583
seems incredible to me

31:48.625 --> 31:51.333
that you could've constructed

31:48.625 --> 31:51.333
this station so rapidly

31:51.375 --> 31:53.250
and so...

31:53.291 --> 31:55.250
and so perfectly suited

31:53.291 --> 31:55.250
to our needs.

31:55.291 --> 31:58.875
Would you care for

31:55.291 --> 31:58.875
an Earth delicacy, Commander?

31:58.917 --> 32:01.458
Well, if there's

31:58.917 --> 32:01.458
an apple...

32:01.500 --> 32:03.917
I'm sorry, Commander.

32:03.959 --> 32:07.250
Oh, it doesn't matter.

32:03.959 --> 32:07.250
What I was saying was...

32:07.291 --> 32:08.917
I'll be damned.

32:08.959 --> 32:10.834
Ah, yes.

32:10.875 --> 32:14.083
There was another

32:10.875 --> 32:14.083
selection here.

32:15.959 --> 32:18.458
Groppler, I could have sworn

32:15.959 --> 32:18.458
this wasn't here a minute ago.

32:18.500 --> 32:22.000
And did your failure to notice

32:18.500 --> 32:22.000
it make it unwelcome?

32:23.542 --> 32:25.542
Not at all, Groppler.

32:25.583 --> 32:28.709
I trust it will be the same with

32:25.583 --> 32:28.709
Farpoint Station, Commander.

32:28.750 --> 32:31.542
A few easily answered

32:28.750 --> 32:31.542
questions about it

32:31.583 --> 32:35.250
won't make Starfleet

32:31.583 --> 32:35.250
appreciate it less.

32:35.291 --> 32:37.166
And it's delicious.

32:35.291 --> 32:37.166
Thank you.

32:37.208 --> 32:39.834
Good morning,

32:37.208 --> 32:39.834
Groppler Zorn.

32:39.875 --> 32:41.667
Good morning.

32:48.792 --> 32:52.000
You have been told

32:48.792 --> 32:52.000
not to do that.

32:52.041 --> 32:54.417
Why can't you understand?

32:54.458 --> 32:57.583
It will arouse

32:54.458 --> 32:57.583
their suspicion.

32:57.625 --> 33:01.500
And if that happens,

32:57.625 --> 33:01.500
we will have to punish you.

33:01.542 --> 33:04.834
We will.

33:01.542 --> 33:04.834
I promise you.

33:12.959 --> 33:15.750
RIKER:

33:12.959 --> 33:15.750
Dr. Crusher!

33:18.750 --> 33:20.166
Mother.

33:20.208 --> 33:22.000
It's Commander Riker.

33:22.041 --> 33:24.667
Hello, Wes.

33:22.041 --> 33:24.667
Enjoying Farpoint Station?

33:22.041 --> 33:24.667
Yes, sir.

33:24.709 --> 33:26.834
I saw you. I thought I might

33:24.709 --> 33:26.834
join you for a stroll.

33:26.875 --> 33:29.458
Actually, we were

33:26.875 --> 33:29.458
about to do some shopping.

33:29.500 --> 33:31.834
I've been meaning to

33:29.500 --> 33:31.834
visit the mall myself.

33:31.875 --> 33:34.041
Of course.

33:35.583 --> 33:37.500
If you're wondering

33:35.583 --> 33:37.500
about mom,

33:37.542 --> 33:39.917
Commander Riker,

33:37.542 --> 33:39.917
she's not unfriendly.

33:39.959 --> 33:43.417
She's just shy around

33:39.959 --> 33:43.417
men she doesn't know.

33:39.959 --> 33:43.417
Wesley.

33:43.458 --> 33:45.125
I believe that means

33:43.458 --> 33:45.125
he would like us to be friends.

33:45.166 --> 33:47.583
Oh, I'm willing,

33:45.166 --> 33:47.583
Doctor.

33:47.625 --> 33:50.333
Although we're

33:47.625 --> 33:50.333
not officially part

33:47.625 --> 33:50.333
of the<i> Enterprise,</i>

33:50.375 --> 33:53.041
I thought there might be

33:50.375 --> 33:53.041
something useful we could

33:50.375 --> 33:53.041
do while we wait.

33:53.083 --> 33:54.875
Useful? How, Commander?

33:54.917 --> 33:57.125
Investigating some things

33:54.917 --> 33:57.125
that I've noticed since

33:54.917 --> 33:57.125
I've been here.

33:57.166 --> 33:58.792
The last was...

33:58.834 --> 34:01.083
Gold would be

33:58.834 --> 34:01.083
lovely with this.

33:58.834 --> 34:01.083
I had asked for an apple...

34:01.125 --> 34:03.959
I am sure, Commander, there are

34:01.125 --> 34:03.959
reasons for a first officer to

34:04.000 --> 34:06.959
want to demonstrate his energy

34:04.000 --> 34:06.959
and alertness to a new captain,

34:07.000 --> 34:08.625
but since my duty

34:07.000 --> 34:08.625
and interests

34:08.667 --> 34:11.417
are outside

34:08.667 --> 34:11.417
the command structure...

34:15.458 --> 34:18.917
Remarkably happened to have

34:15.458 --> 34:18.917
exactly what you asked for?

34:20.583 --> 34:22.542
Thank you.

34:22.583 --> 34:24.625
I'll take

34:22.583 --> 34:24.625
the entire bolt.

34:24.667 --> 34:27.500
Send it to our starship

34:24.667 --> 34:27.500
when it arrives,

34:27.542 --> 34:29.667
charge to Dr. Crusher.

34:37.333 --> 34:38.917
Let's see,

34:37.333 --> 34:38.917
where were we?

34:38.959 --> 34:40.542
I was accusing you

34:38.959 --> 34:40.542
of inventing work

34:40.583 --> 34:42.625
in order to curry favor

34:40.583 --> 34:42.625
with our new captain.

34:42.667 --> 34:43.959
I apologize.

34:44.000 --> 34:47.000
Mom, that gold pattern

34:44.000 --> 34:47.000
wasn't there.

34:47.041 --> 34:48.500
Maybe this

34:47.041 --> 34:48.500
<i>is</i> something

34:48.542 --> 34:50.000
Jean-Luc would

34:48.542 --> 34:50.000
like looked into.

34:50.041 --> 34:52.166
Jean-Luc Picard?

34:52.208 --> 34:54.083
You know the Captain.

34:55.709 --> 34:59.083
When I was little, he brought

34:55.709 --> 34:59.083
my father's body home to us.

34:59.125 --> 35:02.250
Yes, Wes--

34:59.125 --> 35:02.250
long, long ago.

35:02.291 --> 35:05.375
A pleasure to meet you,

35:02.291 --> 35:05.375
Commander.

35:05.417 --> 35:07.917
You will excuse us.

35:05.417 --> 35:07.917
My pleasure, Doctor.

35:07.959 --> 35:09.291
Wes.

35:07.959 --> 35:09.291
Sir?

35:09.333 --> 35:11.000
See you on board.

35:11.041 --> 35:13.291
Yes, sir.

35:13.333 --> 35:16.000
Sir, the<i> Enterprise</i>

35:13.333 --> 35:16.000
is arriving, but...

35:16.041 --> 35:18.583
Is this an official report,

35:16.041 --> 35:18.583
Lieutenant?

35:16.041 --> 35:18.583
Sorry, Commander.

35:18.625 --> 35:21.709
Sir, Lieutenant La Forge

35:18.625 --> 35:21.709
reporting the<i> Enterprise</i>

35:18.625 --> 35:21.709
arriving,

35:21.750 --> 35:23.417
but without

35:21.750 --> 35:23.417
the saucer section, sir.

35:23.458 --> 35:26.792
Stardrive section only?

35:23.458 --> 35:26.792
What happened?

35:23.458 --> 35:26.792
I don't know, sir.

35:26.834 --> 35:28.875
Captain Picard has signaled

35:26.834 --> 35:28.875
for you to beam up immediately.

35:28.917 --> 35:31.166
Our new Captain

35:28.917 --> 35:31.166
doesn't waste time.

35:31.208 --> 35:34.500
It's a good idea.

35:31.208 --> 35:34.500
Thank you, Lieutenant.

35:31.208 --> 35:34.500
Aye, sir.

35:37.166 --> 35:41.291
<i>Enterprise,</i> this is Commander

35:37.166 --> 35:41.291
Riker at Farpoint Station.

35:41.333 --> 35:43.458
Standing by to beam up.

36:12.750 --> 36:14.917
Lieutenant Yar

36:12.750 --> 36:14.917
of Security, sir.

36:14.959 --> 36:17.417
Captain Picard will see

36:14.959 --> 36:17.417
you on the Battle Bridge.

36:21.917 --> 36:23.750
With the saucer gone,

36:21.917 --> 36:23.750
can I assume that

36:23.792 --> 36:25.500
something interesting

36:23.792 --> 36:25.500
happened on the way here?

36:25.542 --> 36:26.875
Battle Bridge.

36:26.917 --> 36:30.208
That's for the Captain

36:26.917 --> 36:30.208
to explain, sir.

36:30.250 --> 36:32.500
Do we have clearance?

36:32.542 --> 36:34.458
Aye, sir, into

36:32.542 --> 36:34.458
standard parking orbit.

36:34.500 --> 36:36.834
Make it so.

36:36.875 --> 36:38.875
Commander Riker, sir.

36:40.959 --> 36:43.709
Riker, W.T.,

36:40.959 --> 36:43.709
reporting as ordered, sir.

36:43.750 --> 36:45.625
Is the viewer ready?

36:45.667 --> 36:47.333
All set up, sir.

36:47.375 --> 36:50.125
We'll first bring you up to date

36:47.375 --> 36:50.125
on a little adventure

36:50.166 --> 36:51.542
we had on our way here,

36:50.166 --> 36:51.542
Commander.

36:51.583 --> 36:53.000
Then we'll talk.

36:58.083 --> 37:01.000
Welcome aboard.

37:02.083 --> 37:04.375
This way, sir.

37:16.583 --> 37:18.208
Thou art directed to return

37:18.250 --> 37:20.625
to thine own

37:18.250 --> 37:20.625
solar system immediately.

37:22.917 --> 37:26.291
Go back, or thou shalt

37:22.917 --> 37:26.291
most certainly die.

37:27.750 --> 37:29.417
But you can't deny

37:27.750 --> 37:29.417
that you're still

37:29.458 --> 37:30.917
a dangerous,

37:29.458 --> 37:30.917
savage child race.

37:30.959 --> 37:33.500
Message from the

37:30.959 --> 37:33.500
saucer module, sir.

37:33.542 --> 37:35.417
It will arrive here

37:33.542 --> 37:35.417
in 51 minutes.

37:35.458 --> 37:38.583
Inform them we'll connect

37:35.458 --> 37:38.583
as soon as they arrive.

37:38.625 --> 37:41.125
And send the Commander to me

37:38.625 --> 37:41.125
when he's finished.

37:41.166 --> 37:43.041
YAR:

37:41.166 --> 37:43.041
Yes, sir.

37:43.083 --> 37:45.875
...and 400 years before that,

37:43.083 --> 37:45.875
you were murdering each other

37:45.917 --> 37:47.959
in quarrels

37:45.917 --> 37:47.959
over tribal god images.

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
Since then,

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
there are no indications

37:50.041 --> 37:51.750
that humans will ever change.

37:51.792 --> 37:55.125
There are preparations to make,

37:51.792 --> 37:55.125
but when we next meet, Captain,

37:55.166 --> 37:58.667
we'll proceed

37:55.166 --> 37:58.667
exactly as you suggest.

38:10.709 --> 38:13.834
He calls that

38:10.709 --> 38:13.834
a little adventure?

38:13.875 --> 38:16.083
(<i> door chime</i> )

38:13.875 --> 38:16.083
Come.

38:25.667 --> 38:28.208
Not exactly a run-of-the-mill

38:25.667 --> 38:28.208
happening, Captain.

38:30.041 --> 38:31.667
It seems we're alive

38:31.709 --> 38:34.083
only because we have been

38:31.709 --> 38:34.083
placed on probation--

38:34.125 --> 38:36.333
a very serious

38:34.125 --> 38:36.333
kind of probation.

38:36.375 --> 38:38.583
(<i> beeping</i> )

38:36.375 --> 38:38.583
Go.

38:38.625 --> 38:42.333
DATA:

38:38.625 --> 38:42.333
The saucer module now

38:38.625 --> 38:42.333
entering orbit with us, sir.

38:42.375 --> 38:44.125
Acknowledged.

38:45.875 --> 38:48.417
Commander Riker will conduct

38:45.875 --> 38:48.417
a manual docking.

38:48.458 --> 38:51.125
Picard out.

38:48.458 --> 38:51.125
Sir?

38:51.166 --> 38:52.750
You've reported in,

38:51.166 --> 38:52.750
haven't you?

38:52.792 --> 38:54.291
You are qualified?

38:52.792 --> 38:54.291
Yes, sir.

38:54.333 --> 38:56.250
Then I mean now, Commander.

39:08.959 --> 39:13.083
You say you will be doing

39:08.959 --> 39:13.083
this manually, sir?

39:13.125 --> 39:15.291
No automation?

39:15.333 --> 39:17.375
As ordered.

39:41.083 --> 39:43.667
Velocity to one-half meter

39:41.083 --> 39:43.667
per second.

39:50.583 --> 39:54.792
Adjust pitch angle

39:50.583 --> 39:54.792
negative three degrees.

40:06.083 --> 40:08.583
Watch your roll angle, Conn.

40:26.000 --> 40:30.041
All stations

40:26.000 --> 40:30.041
prepare for reconnection.

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
Thrusters to station keeping.

40:46.041 --> 40:47.625
All velocities zero.

40:47.667 --> 40:50.250
Her inertia should

40:47.667 --> 40:50.250
do the job now.

40:53.792 --> 40:55.125
Lock up...

40:55.166 --> 40:56.917
now.

41:41.709 --> 41:43.000
A fairly routine maneuver,

41:43.041 --> 41:45.083
but you handled it

41:43.041 --> 41:45.083
quite well.

41:45.125 --> 41:47.125
Thank you, sir.

41:47.166 --> 41:49.250
I hope I show some promise.

41:49.291 --> 41:52.750
I do have some questions

41:49.291 --> 41:52.750
for you, however.

41:52.792 --> 41:55.125
Yes, sir, I thought you might.

41:55.166 --> 41:56.709
I see in your file

41:56.750 --> 41:59.750
that Captain Desoto

41:56.750 --> 41:59.750
thinks very highly of you.

41:59.792 --> 42:01.625
One curious thing, however.

42:01.667 --> 42:04.750
You refused to let him

42:01.667 --> 42:04.750
beam down to Altair III.

42:04.792 --> 42:06.458
In my opinion, sir,

42:06.500 --> 42:09.750
Altair III was too dangerous

42:06.500 --> 42:09.750
to risk exposing the Captain.

42:09.792 --> 42:11.625
I see.

42:11.667 --> 42:13.917
A Captain's rank

42:11.667 --> 42:13.917
means nothing to you.

42:13.959 --> 42:16.625
Rather the reverse, sir,

42:16.667 --> 42:19.166
but a Captain's life means

42:16.667 --> 42:19.166
a great deal more to me.

42:21.458 --> 42:23.792
Isn't it just possible

42:23.834 --> 42:26.375
that you don't get to be

42:23.834 --> 42:26.375
a Starfleet Captain

42:26.417 --> 42:29.625
without knowing whether

42:26.417 --> 42:29.625
it's safe to beam down or not?

42:29.667 --> 42:32.333
Isn't it a little presumptuous

42:29.667 --> 42:32.333
of a first officer

42:32.375 --> 42:35.500
to second-guess

42:32.375 --> 42:35.500
his Captain's judgment?

42:35.542 --> 42:38.917
Permission to speak

42:35.542 --> 42:38.917
candidly, sir?

42:38.959 --> 42:40.834
Always.

42:43.458 --> 42:45.709
Having been

42:43.458 --> 42:45.709
a first officer yourself,

42:45.750 --> 42:48.333
you know that assuming

42:45.750 --> 42:48.333
that responsibility

42:48.375 --> 42:51.917
must, by definition, include

42:48.375 --> 42:51.917
the safety of the Captain.

42:51.959 --> 42:54.875
I have no problem with following

42:51.959 --> 42:54.875
any rules you lay down--

42:54.917 --> 42:56.875
short of compromising

42:54.917 --> 42:56.875
your safety.

42:56.917 --> 42:59.917
And you don't intend

42:56.917 --> 42:59.917
to back off from that position?

42:59.959 --> 43:02.083
No, sir.

43:03.583 --> 43:06.000
One further thing.

43:07.208 --> 43:08.750
A special favor.

43:08.792 --> 43:10.542
Anything, sir.

43:10.583 --> 43:12.917
Using the same strength

43:10.583 --> 43:12.917
you showed with Captain Desoto,

43:12.959 --> 43:14.542
I would appreciate it

43:12.959 --> 43:14.542
if you could you keep me

43:14.583 --> 43:17.500
from making an ass of

43:14.583 --> 43:17.500
myself with children.

43:17.542 --> 43:18.875
Sir?

43:18.917 --> 43:20.583
I'm not a family man, Riker,

43:20.625 --> 43:23.917
and yet Starfleet has given me

43:20.625 --> 43:23.917
a ship with children aboard.

43:23.959 --> 43:25.500
Yes, sir.

43:25.542 --> 43:27.500
And I...

43:27.542 --> 43:30.834
I don't feel comfortable

43:27.542 --> 43:30.834
with children,

43:30.875 --> 43:33.250
but since a Captain

43:33.291 --> 43:35.291
needs an image of geniality,

43:35.333 --> 43:38.542
you're to see

43:35.333 --> 43:38.542
that's what I project.

43:38.583 --> 43:40.542
Aye, sir.

43:41.959 --> 43:45.667
Welcome to the<i> Enterprise,</i>

43:41.959 --> 43:45.667
Commander Riker.

43:50.667 --> 43:53.041
Naturally,

43:50.667 --> 43:53.041
I've heard of your case.

43:53.083 --> 43:54.959
The visor appliance

43:53.083 --> 43:54.959
you wear is...

43:55.000 --> 43:57.917
LA FORGE:

43:55.000 --> 43:57.917
...is a remarkable piece

43:55.000 --> 43:57.917
of bioelectronic engineering

43:57.959 --> 44:00.500
by which I quote "see"

43:57.959 --> 44:00.500
much of the EM spectrum,

44:00.542 --> 44:02.417
ranging from simple heat

44:00.542 --> 44:02.417
and infrared,

44:02.458 --> 44:04.834
through radio waves,

44:02.458 --> 44:04.834
et cetera, et cetera,

44:04.875 --> 44:06.834
and forgive me if I've said

44:04.875 --> 44:06.834
and listened to this

44:06.875 --> 44:09.166
1,000 times before.

44:09.208 --> 44:10.834
You've been blind

44:09.208 --> 44:10.834
all your life?

44:10.875 --> 44:13.375
Mm-hmm. I was born this way.

44:13.417 --> 44:15.792
And you've felt pain all the

44:13.417 --> 44:15.792
years that you've used this?

44:15.834 --> 44:17.458
Hmm... They say it's because

44:17.500 --> 44:20.458
I use my natural sensors

44:17.500 --> 44:20.458
in different ways.

44:22.709 --> 44:24.750
Well, I see two choices:

44:24.792 --> 44:26.500
The first is

44:24.792 --> 44:26.500
pain-killers.

44:26.542 --> 44:28.875
Which would affect

44:26.542 --> 44:28.875
how this works.

44:28.917 --> 44:30.041
Mm-hmm.

44:30.083 --> 44:32.583
No. And choice number two?

44:32.625 --> 44:33.959
Exploratory surgery.

44:34.000 --> 44:36.583
Desensitize the brain

44:34.000 --> 44:36.583
areas troubling you.

44:36.625 --> 44:38.709
Same difference.

44:38.750 --> 44:42.417
No, thank you, Doctor.

44:42.458 --> 44:45.166
I understand.

44:45.208 --> 44:47.291
See you.

45:04.125 --> 45:05.291
Yes, sir?

45:05.333 --> 45:07.041
Where will I find

45:05.333 --> 45:07.041
Commander Data?

45:07.083 --> 45:09.834
Commander Data is

45:07.083 --> 45:09.834
on special assignment, sir.

45:09.875 --> 45:12.959
He's using our shuttlecraft

45:09.875 --> 45:12.959
to transfer an admiral

45:09.875 --> 45:12.959
over to the<i> Hood.</i>

45:13.000 --> 45:14.625
An admiral?

45:14.667 --> 45:16.792
He's been aboard all day, sir,

45:14.667 --> 45:16.792
checking over medical layout.

45:16.834 --> 45:19.417
Why a shuttlecraft?

45:16.834 --> 45:19.417
Why wouldn't he just beam over?

45:19.458 --> 45:21.000
I suppose he could, sir,

45:21.041 --> 45:24.000
but the Admiral's a rather...

45:21.041 --> 45:24.000
remarkable man.

45:24.041 --> 45:26.417
Have you got some reason

45:24.041 --> 45:26.417
you want my atoms

45:26.458 --> 45:29.375
scattered all over space, boy?

45:26.458 --> 45:29.375
No, sir.

45:29.417 --> 45:31.709
But at your age, sir, I thought

45:29.417 --> 45:31.709
you shouldn't have to put up

45:31.750 --> 45:33.750
with the time and trouble

45:31.750 --> 45:33.750
of a shuttlecraft.

45:33.792 --> 45:36.208
Hold it right there, boy.

45:33.792 --> 45:36.208
Sir?

45:36.250 --> 45:37.667
What about my age?

45:37.709 --> 45:40.917
Sorry, sir,

45:37.709 --> 45:40.917
if that subject troubles you.

45:40.959 --> 45:42.500
Troubles me?

45:42.542 --> 45:46.041
What's so damned troublesome

45:42.542 --> 45:46.041
about not having died?

45:46.083 --> 45:48.750
How old do you think

45:46.083 --> 45:48.750
I am, anyway?

45:48.792 --> 45:52.250
137 years, Admiral,

45:48.792 --> 45:52.250
according to Starfleet records.

45:54.083 --> 45:57.875
Explain how you remember that

45:54.083 --> 45:57.875
so exactly.

45:57.917 --> 46:00.709
I remember every fact

45:57.917 --> 46:00.709
I'm exposed to, sir.

46:04.417 --> 46:07.375
I don't see no points

46:04.417 --> 46:07.375
on your ears, boy,

46:07.417 --> 46:09.875
but you sound like a Vulcan.

46:09.917 --> 46:11.208
No, sir.

46:11.250 --> 46:13.417
I am an android.

46:14.583 --> 46:17.166
Hmm...

46:17.208 --> 46:19.291
...almost as bad.

46:20.542 --> 46:22.625
I thought it was

46:20.542 --> 46:22.625
generally accepted, sir,

46:22.667 --> 46:26.083
that Vulcans are an advanced

46:22.667 --> 46:26.083
and most honorable race.

46:26.125 --> 46:27.959
They are, they are.

46:28.000 --> 46:31.000
And damn annoying at times.

46:31.041 --> 46:32.583
Yes, sir.

46:32.625 --> 46:34.000
Well, this is

46:32.625 --> 46:34.000
a new ship,

46:34.041 --> 46:36.875
but she's got

46:34.041 --> 46:36.875
the right name.

46:36.917 --> 46:39.667
Now you remember

46:36.917 --> 46:39.667
that, you hear?

46:39.709 --> 46:40.750
I will, sir.

46:40.792 --> 46:44.583
You treat her like a lady

46:44.625 --> 46:46.750
and she'll always

46:44.625 --> 46:46.750
bring you home.

47:14.792 --> 47:17.333
Did you signal the<i> Hood,</i>

47:14.792 --> 47:17.333
Commander Riker?

47:17.375 --> 47:20.208
Your exact message:

47:17.375 --> 47:20.208
<i>Bon voyage, mon ami.</i>

47:20.250 --> 47:21.959
Ah, what was the reply,

47:20.250 --> 47:21.959
computer?

47:22.000 --> 47:24.500
Q:

47:22.000 --> 47:24.500
You're wasting time, Captain.

47:24.542 --> 47:27.417
Or did you think I was gone?

47:27.458 --> 47:29.208
Lieutenant!

47:30.583 --> 47:33.500
Do you intend to

47:30.583 --> 47:33.500
blast a hole in the viewer?

47:35.000 --> 47:37.583
If the purpose of this

47:37.625 --> 47:39.458
is to test humans,

47:37.625 --> 47:39.458
Your Honor,

47:39.500 --> 47:41.333
we must proceed

47:39.500 --> 47:41.333
in our own way.

47:41.375 --> 47:44.583
You are dilatory.

47:41.375 --> 47:44.583
You have 24 hours.

47:44.625 --> 47:48.750
Any further delay

47:44.625 --> 47:48.750
and you risk summary judgment

47:44.625 --> 47:48.750
against you, Captain.

47:50.875 --> 47:51.959
Sorry, sir.

47:52.000 --> 47:54.458
You reacted fast, Mr. Worf.

47:54.500 --> 47:56.625
But futilely.

47:56.667 --> 47:58.959
I will learn

47:56.667 --> 47:58.959
to do better, sir.

47:59.000 --> 48:01.208
Of course you will.

48:01.250 --> 48:03.625
We've a long voyage

48:01.250 --> 48:03.625
ahead of us.

48:08.125 --> 48:10.291
What do we do now, Captain,

48:08.125 --> 48:10.291
with them monitoring

48:10.333 --> 48:11.875
our every move

48:10.333 --> 48:11.875
and every word?

48:11.917 --> 48:15.333
We do exactly what we'd do

48:11.917 --> 48:15.333
if this Q never existed.

48:17.417 --> 48:18.959
If we're going to be damned,

48:19.041 --> 48:21.500
let's be damned

48:19.041 --> 48:21.500
for what we really are.

48:23.333 --> 48:28.125
PICARD:

48:23.333 --> 48:28.125
<i>Personal Log,</i>

48:23.333 --> 48:28.125
<i>Stardate 41153.8:</i>

48:28.166 --> 48:32.208
<i>Of the 24 hours Q allotted us</i>

48:28.166 --> 48:32.208
<i>to prove ourselves,</i>

48:32.250 --> 48:34.875
<i>11 have now passed</i>

48:32.250 --> 48:34.875
<i>without incident.</i>

48:34.917 --> 48:37.709
<i>And yet I cannot forget</i>

48:34.917 --> 48:37.709
<i>Q's prediction</i>

48:37.750 --> 48:41.333
<i>that we will face</i>

48:37.750 --> 48:41.333
<i>some critical test.</i>

48:41.375 --> 48:43.000
This planet's interior heat

48:43.041 --> 48:44.917
provides an abundance

48:43.041 --> 48:44.917
of geothermal energy,

48:44.959 --> 48:46.917
but it's about all

48:44.959 --> 48:46.917
this world does offer.

48:46.959 --> 48:49.208
And it's your belief that this

48:46.959 --> 48:49.208
is what made it possible

48:49.250 --> 48:53.375
for them to construct this

48:49.250 --> 48:53.375
base to Starfleet standards?

48:49.250 --> 48:53.375
Yes, sir.

48:53.417 --> 48:55.667
We have to assume that

48:53.417 --> 48:55.667
they've been trading

48:53.417 --> 48:55.667
their surplus energy

48:55.709 --> 48:57.625
for construction

48:55.709 --> 48:57.625
materials used here.

48:57.667 --> 48:59.291
According to our ship's scans,

48:59.333 --> 49:01.709
many of the materials used

48:59.333 --> 49:01.709
are not found on this world.

49:01.750 --> 49:03.542
Perhaps it's like

49:01.750 --> 49:03.542
those incidents

49:03.583 --> 49:05.208
you describe in your report

49:05.250 --> 49:07.875
as almost magical attempts

49:05.250 --> 49:07.875
to please us.

49:07.917 --> 49:09.959
Those events did happen, sir.

49:11.667 --> 49:14.542
None of it suggests

49:11.667 --> 49:14.542
anything threatening.

49:14.583 --> 49:18.875
If only every life-form

49:14.583 --> 49:18.875
had as much desire to please.

49:18.917 --> 49:21.417
Ready to beam down?

49:21.458 --> 49:24.333
I'm looking forward to meeting

49:21.458 --> 49:24.333
this Groppler Zorn.

49:24.375 --> 49:27.542
I've a feeling there's

49:24.375 --> 49:27.542
more to it than just trying

49:24.375 --> 49:27.542
to please us, sir.

49:27.583 --> 49:30.542
As if it's something

49:27.583 --> 49:30.542
Q is doing to trick us?

49:30.583 --> 49:32.333
Over here.

49:32.375 --> 49:35.000
I've asked the Counselor

49:32.375 --> 49:35.000
to join us in this meeting.

49:36.625 --> 49:38.709
May I introduce our

49:36.625 --> 49:38.709
new first officer,

49:38.750 --> 49:40.458
Commander William Riker.

49:40.500 --> 49:43.125
Commander Riker, this is our

49:40.500 --> 49:43.125
ship's counselor, Deanna Troi.

49:44.625 --> 49:48.959
<i>Do you remember</i>

49:44.625 --> 49:48.959
<i>what I taught you, Imzadi?</i>

49:49.000 --> 49:52.583
<i>Can you still</i>

49:49.000 --> 49:52.583
<i>sense my thoughts?</i>

49:52.625 --> 49:56.000
A pleasure, Commander.

49:57.458 --> 50:00.333
Likewise, Counselor.

50:00.375 --> 50:03.375
Have the two

50:00.375 --> 50:03.375
of you met before?

50:03.417 --> 50:06.500
We have, sir.

50:06.542 --> 50:08.375
Excellent.

50:11.166 --> 50:14.959
I consider it important

50:11.166 --> 50:14.959
for my key officers

50:15.000 --> 50:18.333
to know each other's

50:15.000 --> 50:18.333
abilities.

50:18.375 --> 50:20.500
We do, sir.

50:20.542 --> 50:23.375
We do.

50:23.417 --> 50:27.583
<i>I, too, could never</i>

50:23.417 --> 50:27.583
<i>say good-bye, Imzadi.</i>

50:37.667 --> 50:40.208
My crew and I

50:37.667 --> 50:40.208
need more information

50:40.250 --> 50:42.583
before we can make our

50:40.250 --> 50:42.583
recommendations to Starfleet.

50:42.625 --> 50:45.125
No objections to that,

50:45.166 --> 50:46.583
but I'm puzzled

50:46.625 --> 50:48.542
over you bringing

50:46.625 --> 50:48.542
a Betazoid to this meeting.

50:48.583 --> 50:52.250
If her purpose, sir,

50:48.583 --> 50:52.250
is to probe my thoughts...

50:52.291 --> 50:55.333
I can sense only

50:52.291 --> 50:55.333
strong emotions, Groppler.

50:55.375 --> 50:57.500
I'm only half Betazoid.

50:57.542 --> 51:00.291
My father was

50:57.542 --> 51:00.291
a Starfleet officer.

51:01.417 --> 51:03.458
I have nothing to hide,

51:01.417 --> 51:03.458
of course.

51:03.500 --> 51:04.959
Good, since we admire

51:05.000 --> 51:07.959
what we've seen of

51:05.000 --> 51:07.959
your construction techniques.

51:08.000 --> 51:09.792
Starfleet may be interested

51:09.834 --> 51:13.125
in your constructing

51:09.834 --> 51:13.125
Starbases elsewhere, also.

51:13.166 --> 51:16.000
We are not interested

51:13.166 --> 51:16.000
in building other facilities.

51:16.041 --> 51:17.583
If I may, Captain.

51:17.625 --> 51:19.583
Then a trade, Groppler.

51:19.625 --> 51:23.083
Some things that you need

51:19.625 --> 51:23.083
in return for lending us

51:19.625 --> 51:23.083
architects and engineers

51:23.125 --> 51:24.667
who can demonstrate

51:23.125 --> 51:24.667
your techniques.

51:24.709 --> 51:29.041
Bandi do not enjoy leaving

51:24.709 --> 51:29.041
their homeworld.

51:29.083 --> 51:31.333
If Starfleet

51:29.083 --> 51:31.333
cannot accept

51:31.375 --> 51:33.125
that small weakness

51:33.166 --> 51:35.500
then we will be forced,

51:33.166 --> 51:35.500
unhappily,

51:35.542 --> 51:39.083
to seek an alliance with someone

51:35.542 --> 51:39.083
like the Ferengi...

51:42.041 --> 51:43.875
(<i> gasps softly</i> )

51:43.917 --> 51:46.250
Counselor,

51:43.917 --> 51:46.250
what is it?

51:46.291 --> 51:49.583
Do you want it

51:46.291 --> 51:49.583
described here, sir?

51:49.625 --> 51:51.542
Yes, no secrets here

51:51.583 --> 51:53.625
if we're to be old friends,

51:51.583 --> 51:53.625
agreed, Groppler?

51:53.667 --> 51:55.750
But we ourselves have

51:53.667 --> 51:55.750
nothing to hide, of course.

52:00.041 --> 52:02.000
Pain.

52:03.208 --> 52:05.208
Pain.

52:07.917 --> 52:11.000
Loneliness...

52:11.041 --> 52:13.792
terrible loneliness.

52:13.834 --> 52:16.709
Despair...

52:21.458 --> 52:23.458
I'm not sensing Groppler, sir,

52:23.500 --> 52:25.875
or any of his people,

52:25.917 --> 52:29.458
but it's something

52:25.917 --> 52:29.458
very close to us here.

52:29.500 --> 52:31.542
PICARD:

52:29.500 --> 52:31.542
The source of this, Groppler--

52:31.583 --> 52:33.375
have you any idea?

52:33.417 --> 52:36.625
No... no, absolutely not.

52:36.667 --> 52:40.500
And I find nothing helpful

52:36.667 --> 52:40.500
or productive in any of this.

52:40.542 --> 52:43.208
And that's it?

52:40.542 --> 52:43.208
No other comment?

52:43.250 --> 52:45.125
Well, what do you expect of us?

52:45.166 --> 52:47.291
We offer you a base

52:45.166 --> 52:47.291
designed to your needs,

52:47.333 --> 52:49.500
luxurious by even

52:47.333 --> 52:49.500
human standards...

52:49.542 --> 52:52.875
While evading even our

52:49.542 --> 52:52.875
simplest questions about it.

52:52.917 --> 52:55.000
We'll adjourn for now.

52:56.583 --> 52:59.333
While we all reconsider

52:56.583 --> 52:59.333
our positions.

52:59.375 --> 53:01.041
Captain!

53:01.083 --> 53:03.750
The Ferengi would be very

53:01.083 --> 53:03.750
interested in a base like this!

53:03.792 --> 53:05.792
Fine. Let's hope

53:03.792 --> 53:05.792
they find you

53:05.834 --> 53:08.583
as tasty as they did

53:05.834 --> 53:08.583
their past associates.

53:21.041 --> 53:23.875
Ensign, could you help me

53:21.041 --> 53:23.875
find Commander Data?

53:23.917 --> 53:25.375
I understand

53:23.917 --> 53:25.375
he's somewhere on this deck.

53:25.417 --> 53:27.208
This way, sir.

53:27.250 --> 53:31.125
You must be new to these

53:27.250 --> 53:31.125
Galaxy-class starships, sir.

53:31.166 --> 53:34.041
Tell me the location

53:31.166 --> 53:34.041
of Commander Data.

53:34.083 --> 53:36.333
Lieutenant Commander Data

53:36.375 --> 53:39.417
now located

53:36.375 --> 53:39.417
in Holodeck area 4-J.

53:39.458 --> 53:42.625
And as you can see, sir,

53:39.458 --> 53:42.625
it's pointing you that way.

53:42.667 --> 53:45.083
Thank you.

53:45.125 --> 53:47.375
You're welcome, sir.

53:49.834 --> 53:53.834
The next hatchway on your right.

53:49.834 --> 53:53.834
Thank you.

53:53.875 --> 53:55.792
You're welcome,

53:53.875 --> 53:55.792
Commander Riker.

53:55.834 --> 53:57.750
And if you care to enter,

53:55.834 --> 53:57.750
Commander...

53:57.792 --> 53:59.875
I do.

54:46.834 --> 54:49.417
Hello!

55:13.208 --> 55:16.041
<i>(whistling</i>

55:13.208 --> 55:16.041
"Pop Goes the Weasel")

55:31.417 --> 55:35.375
Marvelous how easily

55:31.417 --> 55:35.375
humans do that.

55:35.417 --> 55:37.875
I still need much practice.

55:37.917 --> 55:40.542
There's some

55:37.917 --> 55:40.542
puzzles down on...

55:42.250 --> 55:45.834
...down on the planet

55:42.250 --> 55:45.834
that the Captain wants answered.

55:45.875 --> 55:48.250
He suggested I take you

55:45.875 --> 55:48.250
with me on the away team

55:45.875 --> 55:48.250
that I'll be leading.

55:48.291 --> 55:50.917
I shall endeavor

55:48.291 --> 55:50.917
to function adequately, sir.

55:50.959 --> 55:53.041
Yes.

55:58.959 --> 56:01.583
When the Captain suggested you,

55:58.959 --> 56:01.583
I looked up your record.

56:01.625 --> 56:03.959
Yes, sir. A wise

56:01.625 --> 56:03.959
procedure, sir, always.

56:04.000 --> 56:06.417
Then your rank of Lieutenant

56:04.000 --> 56:06.417
Commander is honorary?

56:06.458 --> 56:08.750
No, sir.

56:06.458 --> 56:08.750
Starfleet class of '78.

56:08.792 --> 56:11.166
Honors in probability

56:08.792 --> 56:11.166
mechanics and exobiology.

56:11.208 --> 56:13.000
But your file says

56:11.208 --> 56:13.000
that you're a...

56:13.041 --> 56:15.500
A machine. Correct, sir.

56:13.041 --> 56:15.500
Does that trouble you?

56:15.542 --> 56:17.583
To be honest,

56:15.542 --> 56:17.583
yes, a little.

56:17.625 --> 56:20.583
Understood, sir.

56:17.625 --> 56:20.583
Prejudice is very human.

56:20.625 --> 56:22.625
Now that does trouble me.

56:22.667 --> 56:24.792
Do you consider yourself

56:22.667 --> 56:24.792
superior to us?

56:24.834 --> 56:26.625
I am superior, sir,

56:24.834 --> 56:26.625
in many ways.

56:26.667 --> 56:30.291
But I would gladly

56:26.667 --> 56:30.291
give it up to be human.

56:30.333 --> 56:34.375
Nice to meet you...

56:30.333 --> 56:34.375
Pinocchio.

56:36.125 --> 56:37.417
A joke.

56:38.917 --> 56:41.041
Ah! Intriguing.

56:41.083 --> 56:44.959
You're going to be an

56:41.083 --> 56:44.959
interesting companion, Mr. Data.

56:52.375 --> 56:54.750
This woodland pattern

56:52.375 --> 56:54.750
is quite popular, sir,

56:54.792 --> 56:57.291
perhaps because it

56:54.792 --> 56:57.291
duplicates Earth so well.

56:57.333 --> 57:00.125
Coming here almost makes

56:57.333 --> 57:00.125
me feel human myself.

57:00.166 --> 57:03.000
I didn't believe these

57:00.166 --> 57:03.000
simulations could be this real.

57:03.041 --> 57:04.834
Much of it is real, sir.

57:04.875 --> 57:07.250
If the transporters

57:04.875 --> 57:07.250
can convert our bodies

57:04.875 --> 57:07.250
into an energy beam

57:07.291 --> 57:09.125
then back to

57:07.291 --> 57:09.125
the original pattern...

57:09.166 --> 57:11.125
Yes, of course, and these

57:09.166 --> 57:11.125
rocks and vegetation

57:11.166 --> 57:14.458
have much simpler

57:11.166 --> 57:14.458
patterns.

57:11.166 --> 57:14.458
Correct, sir.

57:14.500 --> 57:16.125
The rear wall.

57:16.166 --> 57:17.625
I can't see it.

57:17.667 --> 57:19.375
We're right next to it.

57:26.291 --> 57:28.208
Incredible.

57:34.291 --> 57:37.125
WESLEY:

57:34.291 --> 57:37.125
Commander Riker!

57:37.166 --> 57:39.917
Commander Riker,

57:37.166 --> 57:39.917
isn't this great?

57:39.959 --> 57:42.250
This is one

57:39.959 --> 57:42.250
of the simple patterns.

57:42.291 --> 57:43.959
They've got thousands more.

57:44.000 --> 57:45.750
Some you just can't believe.

57:45.792 --> 57:48.625
Careful, the next rock

57:45.792 --> 57:48.625
is loose!

57:50.750 --> 57:52.333
Wesley!

58:01.166 --> 58:03.041
Wow!

58:07.458 --> 58:10.291
(<i> holodeck door opens</i> )

58:13.375 --> 58:17.375
Mr. Data has agreed to join me

58:13.375 --> 58:17.375
on the away team, Captain.

58:17.417 --> 58:20.250
Very good, Commander.

58:21.959 --> 58:25.458
Sir, maybe I should get

58:21.959 --> 58:25.458
something to wipe this water up?

58:25.500 --> 58:27.875
Good idea.

58:36.333 --> 58:38.458
There's a low-gravity

58:36.333 --> 58:38.458
gymnasium, too.

58:38.500 --> 58:41.291
It would be hard

58:38.500 --> 58:41.291
to get bored on this ship.

58:41.333 --> 58:43.000
Good.

58:48.792 --> 58:52.125
Mom, could you get me

58:48.792 --> 58:52.125
a look at the Bridge?

58:52.166 --> 58:54.208
That's against

58:52.166 --> 58:54.208
the Captain's standing orders.

58:54.250 --> 58:56.291
Are you afraid

58:54.250 --> 58:56.291
of the Captain, too?

58:56.333 --> 58:59.166
I certainly am not.

58:59.208 --> 59:02.083
But Captain Picard

58:59.208 --> 59:02.083
is a pain, isn't he?

59:02.125 --> 59:04.417
Your father

59:02.125 --> 59:04.417
liked him very much.

59:04.458 --> 59:06.583
Great explorers

59:04.458 --> 59:06.583
are often lonely--

59:06.625 --> 59:08.834
no chance to have a family.

59:09.834 --> 59:11.709
Just a look

59:09.834 --> 59:11.709
at the Bridge.

59:11.750 --> 59:13.917
I'll stay in the turbolift

59:11.750 --> 59:13.917
when the doors open.

59:13.959 --> 59:15.208
I won't get off.

59:15.250 --> 59:17.917
You are asking

59:15.250 --> 59:17.917
for trouble, Wes.

59:24.542 --> 59:26.583
We'll see what we can do.

59:39.500 --> 59:41.250
YAR:

59:39.500 --> 59:41.250
Recommend that

59:39.500 --> 59:41.250
someone could begin

59:41.291 --> 59:43.667
by examining the underside

59:41.291 --> 59:43.667
of the station, sir.

59:43.709 --> 59:45.959
Our sensors do show

59:43.709 --> 59:45.959
some passages, sir.

59:46.000 --> 59:47.834
Perhaps you and I.

59:47.875 --> 59:49.667
Tasha, you and the Counselor.

59:49.709 --> 59:52.041
And, Geordi, I want

59:49.709 --> 59:52.041
your eyes down there.

59:52.083 --> 59:54.208
You and I will start topside.

1:00:26.000 --> 1:00:28.333
Have you noticed

1:00:26.000 --> 1:00:28.333
anything unusual?

1:00:28.375 --> 1:00:30.083
I can't see as well

1:00:28.375 --> 1:00:30.083
as Geordi, sir,

1:00:30.125 --> 1:00:32.291
but so far, the material

1:00:30.125 --> 1:00:32.291
seems rather ordinary.

1:00:32.333 --> 1:00:33.500
Construction records?

1:00:33.542 --> 1:00:35.000
Construction records

1:00:33.542 --> 1:00:35.000
shows this to be

1:00:35.041 --> 1:00:37.792
almost identical to that

1:00:35.041 --> 1:00:37.792
which Starfleet uses.

1:00:39.959 --> 1:00:41.917
YAR:

1:00:39.959 --> 1:00:41.917
Team leader.

1:00:41.959 --> 1:00:44.000
We found something interesting.

1:00:44.041 --> 1:00:47.583
We're in a passageway directly

1:00:44.041 --> 1:00:47.583
under the station, sir.

1:00:47.625 --> 1:00:49.166
But these tunnel walls

1:00:49.208 --> 1:00:51.291
are something

1:00:49.208 --> 1:00:51.291
I've never seen before, sir.

1:00:51.333 --> 1:00:53.083
How are you

1:00:51.333 --> 1:00:53.083
examining them, Geordi?

1:00:53.125 --> 1:00:56.750
In every way: microscopically,

1:00:53.125 --> 1:00:56.750
thermally, electromagnetically.

1:00:56.792 --> 1:00:58.500
None of it

1:00:56.792 --> 1:00:58.500
is familiar.

1:00:58.542 --> 1:01:00.709
RIKER:

1:00:58.542 --> 1:01:00.709
And what about you, Troi?

1:01:02.333 --> 1:01:05.375
Sir, I've avoided

1:01:02.333 --> 1:01:05.375
opening my mind.

1:01:05.417 --> 1:01:08.083
Whatever I felt

1:01:05.417 --> 1:01:08.083
in the Groppler's office

1:01:08.125 --> 1:01:09.875
became very uncomfortable.

1:01:09.917 --> 1:01:12.792
I'm sorry, Counselor, but you

1:01:09.917 --> 1:01:12.792
must, we need more information.

1:01:18.959 --> 1:01:20.750
Pain.

1:01:22.166 --> 1:01:24.166
Such pain.

1:01:25.250 --> 1:01:26.792
Pain.

1:01:26.834 --> 1:01:28.125
Hang on. I'm coming.

1:01:28.166 --> 1:01:30.000
<i>Enterprise,</i> lock us on

1:01:28.166 --> 1:01:30.000
to her signal.

1:01:41.041 --> 1:01:42.792
I'm sorry.

1:01:42.834 --> 1:01:44.125
Close your mind

1:01:42.834 --> 1:01:44.125
to the pain.

1:01:44.166 --> 1:01:46.959
Unhappiness.

1:01:48.750 --> 1:01:50.750
Terrible despair.

1:01:50.792 --> 1:01:52.834
Who?

1:01:53.834 --> 1:01:56.458
I don't know.

1:01:56.500 --> 1:01:59.417
No life-form

1:01:56.500 --> 1:01:59.417
anything like us.

1:01:59.458 --> 1:02:02.041
What in the hell kind

1:01:59.458 --> 1:02:02.041
of place is this?

1:02:02.083 --> 1:02:03.959
Geordi, what do you see?

1:02:04.000 --> 1:02:06.875
Well, it's of...

1:02:06.917 --> 1:02:10.417
it's of no material

1:02:06.917 --> 1:02:10.417
I recognize, sir,

1:02:10.458 --> 1:02:13.041
or have even heard of.

1:02:35.750 --> 1:02:38.250
What the hell...

1:02:38.291 --> 1:02:40.750
Children are not allowed

1:02:38.291 --> 1:02:40.750
on the Bridge.

1:02:46.875 --> 1:02:49.083
Permission to report

1:02:46.875 --> 1:02:49.083
to the Captain.

1:02:49.125 --> 1:02:51.667
Dr. Crusher.

1:02:51.709 --> 1:02:54.166
Captain.

1:02:55.625 --> 1:02:57.375
Sir, my son is not

1:02:55.625 --> 1:02:57.375
on the Bridge.

1:02:57.417 --> 1:02:59.542
He merely accompanied me

1:02:57.417 --> 1:02:59.542
on the turbolift.

1:03:04.583 --> 1:03:06.333
Your son?

1:03:06.375 --> 1:03:09.542
His name's Wesley.

1:03:09.583 --> 1:03:12.208
You last saw him

1:03:09.583 --> 1:03:12.208
years ago when...

1:03:22.959 --> 1:03:25.000
Well...

1:03:26.625 --> 1:03:28.834
...as long as he's here.

1:03:31.709 --> 1:03:33.750
I, uh...

1:03:34.834 --> 1:03:37.500
I knew...

1:03:39.291 --> 1:03:41.333
I knew your father, Wesley.

1:03:44.375 --> 1:03:46.333
Want to look around?

1:04:05.583 --> 1:04:07.709
But don't touch anything.

1:04:25.583 --> 1:04:27.375
Try it out.

1:04:34.458 --> 1:04:37.208
The panel on your right

1:04:34.458 --> 1:04:37.208
is for log entries,

1:04:37.250 --> 1:04:39.291
library-computer access

1:04:37.250 --> 1:04:39.291
and retrieval,

1:04:39.333 --> 1:04:41.917
view screen control

1:04:39.333 --> 1:04:41.917
and intercoms and so on.

1:04:41.959 --> 1:04:44.667
Here we have...

1:04:41.959 --> 1:04:44.667
On here, the backup

1:04:41.959 --> 1:04:44.667
conn and ops panels

1:04:44.709 --> 1:04:46.583
plus shield

1:04:44.709 --> 1:04:46.583
and armament controls.

1:04:46.625 --> 1:04:50.208
The forward view screen

1:04:46.625 --> 1:04:50.208
is controlled from

1:04:46.625 --> 1:04:50.208
the ops position...

1:04:50.250 --> 1:04:53.417
...which uses high-resolution,

1:04:50.250 --> 1:04:53.417
multispectral imaging sensors.

1:04:53.458 --> 1:04:55.041
How the hell do you

1:04:53.458 --> 1:04:55.041
know that, boy?

1:04:55.083 --> 1:04:56.458
(<i> alarm blaring</i> )

1:04:56.500 --> 1:04:58.250
Perimeter alert, Captain!

1:04:56.500 --> 1:04:58.250
Wesley!

1:04:58.291 --> 1:04:59.792
I'm sorry, I didn't...

1:04:59.834 --> 1:05:01.041
Wes, you shouldn't have

1:04:59.834 --> 1:05:01.041
touched anything.

1:05:01.083 --> 1:05:02.333
Get off the Bridge,

1:05:01.083 --> 1:05:02.333
both of you.

1:05:02.375 --> 1:05:03.667
We have a perimeter

1:05:02.375 --> 1:05:03.667
alert, sir.

1:05:03.709 --> 1:05:05.875
As my son tried to tell you.

1:05:09.667 --> 1:05:11.291
Picard. Go ahead.

1:05:11.333 --> 1:05:13.083
SECURITY:

1:05:11.333 --> 1:05:13.083
Ship's sensors have

1:05:11.333 --> 1:05:13.083
detected the presence

1:05:13.125 --> 1:05:14.750
of a vessel

1:05:13.125 --> 1:05:14.750
approaching this planet.

1:05:14.792 --> 1:05:17.083
No ship is scheduled

1:05:14.792 --> 1:05:17.083
to arrive at this time, sir.

1:05:17.125 --> 1:05:19.750
Have Commander Riker

1:05:17.125 --> 1:05:19.750
and his team beam back up.

1:05:19.792 --> 1:05:22.083
Security, could that be

1:05:19.792 --> 1:05:22.083
the<i> Hood</i> returning here?

1:05:22.125 --> 1:05:25.667
The vessel does not match

1:05:22.125 --> 1:05:25.667
the<i> Hood's</i> configuration

1:05:22.125 --> 1:05:25.667
or ID signal.

1:05:25.709 --> 1:05:28.208
Put it on main viewer.

1:05:28.250 --> 1:05:29.625
Identification?

1:05:29.667 --> 1:05:31.792
Vessel unknown,

1:05:29.667 --> 1:05:31.792
configuration unknown, sir.

1:05:41.041 --> 1:05:42.917
Hail it.

1:05:42.959 --> 1:05:46.542
We've been trying, sir--

1:05:42.959 --> 1:05:46.542
no response.

1:05:50.375 --> 1:05:52.291
Raise all shields.

1:05:52.333 --> 1:05:53.875
Phasers at ready.

1:05:53.917 --> 1:05:56.709
Shields up, sir,

1:05:53.917 --> 1:05:56.709
phasers ready.

1:06:12.875 --> 1:06:14.542
PICARD:

1:06:12.875 --> 1:06:14.542
Get me Groppler Zorn

1:06:14.583 --> 1:06:17.875
and continue universal

1:06:14.583 --> 1:06:17.875
greetings on all frequencies.

1:06:17.917 --> 1:06:19.667
This is Zorn, Captain.

1:06:19.709 --> 1:06:23.125
Zorn, an unidentified vessel

1:06:19.709 --> 1:06:23.125
has entered into orbit with us.

1:06:23.166 --> 1:06:25.083
Do you know who it is?

1:06:25.125 --> 1:06:27.458
There are no ships scheduled

1:06:25.125 --> 1:06:27.458
to arrive until...

1:06:27.500 --> 1:06:29.875
I asked you

1:06:27.500 --> 1:06:29.875
if you knew who it is.

1:06:29.917 --> 1:06:31.792
You mentioned the

1:06:29.917 --> 1:06:31.792
Ferengi alliance to me.

1:06:31.834 --> 1:06:36.291
But we've had

1:06:31.834 --> 1:06:36.291
no dealings with them.

1:06:36.333 --> 1:06:38.709
It was only a... a thought.

1:06:38.750 --> 1:06:40.875
Are you certain?

1:06:38.750 --> 1:06:40.875
I promise you, Captain.

1:06:40.917 --> 1:06:43.041
We were making an empty threat.

1:06:43.083 --> 1:06:46.166
I wanted your cooperation.

1:06:43.083 --> 1:06:46.166
Forgive me.

1:06:46.208 --> 1:06:48.625
Definitely entering

1:06:46.208 --> 1:06:48.625
orbital trajectory, sir.

1:06:48.667 --> 1:06:51.000
It measures 12 times

1:06:48.667 --> 1:06:51.000
our volume, Captain.

1:07:23.291 --> 1:07:26.291
The sensors say we were

1:07:23.291 --> 1:07:26.291
just scanned, sir.

1:07:31.625 --> 1:07:33.542
Pain again?

1:07:35.625 --> 1:07:38.000
Troi, you've been

1:07:35.625 --> 1:07:38.000
at it enough.

1:07:38.041 --> 1:07:39.792
No.

1:07:39.834 --> 1:07:42.250
I feel close to

1:07:39.834 --> 1:07:42.250
an answer of some kind.

1:07:42.291 --> 1:07:46.250
Commander, something down here

1:07:42.291 --> 1:07:46.250
is shielding our communicators.

1:07:46.291 --> 1:07:48.208
Yes.

1:07:48.250 --> 1:07:50.125
That's exactly the feeling

1:07:48.250 --> 1:07:50.125
I've been reading--

1:07:50.166 --> 1:07:52.917
as if someone doesn't want us

1:07:50.166 --> 1:07:52.917
to be in touch with our ship.

1:07:52.959 --> 1:07:55.542
Come on.

1:07:52.959 --> 1:07:55.542
Let's get to the surface.

1:08:02.583 --> 1:08:05.750
There is no computer record

1:08:02.583 --> 1:08:05.750
of any such vessel, sir.

1:08:05.792 --> 1:08:07.417
Nothing even close.

1:08:07.458 --> 1:08:09.041
Still no response, sir.

1:08:09.083 --> 1:08:10.917
We've done everything

1:08:09.083 --> 1:08:10.917
but threaten them.

1:08:14.166 --> 1:08:16.667
Sensor scans,

1:08:14.166 --> 1:08:16.667
Mr. Worf.

1:08:16.709 --> 1:08:19.917
Our sensor signals

1:08:16.709 --> 1:08:19.917
just seem to bounce off.

1:08:19.959 --> 1:08:21.959
Something's happening, sir.

1:08:24.417 --> 1:08:26.750
They're firing

1:08:24.417 --> 1:08:26.750
on Farpoint, sir.

1:08:26.792 --> 1:08:29.542
Bring photon torpedoes

1:08:26.792 --> 1:08:29.542
to ready.

1:08:26.792 --> 1:08:29.542
Wait, sir.

1:08:29.583 --> 1:08:31.959
They're hitting the old Bandi

1:08:29.583 --> 1:08:31.959
city, not Farpoint Station.

1:08:50.709 --> 1:08:52.917
Those stairs are where

1:08:50.709 --> 1:08:52.917
we entered down here, sir.

1:08:52.959 --> 1:08:56.250
At this point it becomes

1:08:52.959 --> 1:08:56.250
ordinary stone, sir,

1:08:52.959 --> 1:08:56.250
matching what's above.

1:08:58.458 --> 1:09:01.375
My God, was that

1:08:58.458 --> 1:09:01.375
a phaser blast?

1:09:01.417 --> 1:09:03.917
DATA:

1:09:01.417 --> 1:09:03.917
Negative, but something similar.

1:09:05.792 --> 1:09:08.709
You, Tasha, and Geordi

1:09:05.792 --> 1:09:08.709
will beam up to the ship now.

1:09:08.750 --> 1:09:11.000
Come on. I want to see

1:09:08.750 --> 1:09:11.000
exactly what's happening.

1:09:15.750 --> 1:09:18.125
Don't! If you should be hurt...

1:09:18.166 --> 1:09:20.750
You have your

1:09:18.166 --> 1:09:20.750
orders, Lieutenant.

1:09:20.792 --> 1:09:22.625
Carry them out.

1:09:22.667 --> 1:09:24.125
Yes, sir.

1:09:24.166 --> 1:09:26.291
I'm sorry, sir.

1:09:28.291 --> 1:09:31.250
<i>Enterprise,</i>

1:09:28.291 --> 1:09:31.250
three to beam up.

1:09:41.083 --> 1:09:44.333
<i>Enterprise, Enterprise,</i>

1:09:41.083 --> 1:09:44.333
come in.

1:09:44.375 --> 1:09:46.458
Help us, please.

1:09:48.792 --> 1:09:50.333
What shall we do?

1:09:50.375 --> 1:09:52.667
<i>Enterprise,</i> help us, please!

1:09:52.709 --> 1:09:54.625
Tune that down.

1:09:54.667 --> 1:09:56.792
Commander Riker, come in.

1:09:54.667 --> 1:09:56.792
Can you hear me?

1:10:02.792 --> 1:10:04.709
Riker to<i> Enterprise,</i>

1:10:02.792 --> 1:10:04.709
come in.

1:10:04.750 --> 1:10:07.291
PICARD:

1:10:04.750 --> 1:10:07.291
Commander Riker, come in.

1:10:04.750 --> 1:10:07.291
Where are you?

1:10:07.333 --> 1:10:10.291
With Data, on the edge

1:10:07.333 --> 1:10:10.291
of the old city, sir.

1:10:10.333 --> 1:10:13.375
It's being hit

1:10:10.333 --> 1:10:13.375
hard, sir.

1:10:13.417 --> 1:10:14.834
And Farpoint Station?

1:10:13.417 --> 1:10:14.834
Any damage there?

1:10:14.875 --> 1:10:17.542
Negative on damage

1:10:14.875 --> 1:10:17.542
to Farpoint, sir.

1:10:17.583 --> 1:10:19.166
Whoever they are,

1:10:19.208 --> 1:10:20.750
they're carefully avoiding

1:10:19.208 --> 1:10:20.750
hitting the Station.

1:10:20.792 --> 1:10:22.583
It's from

1:10:20.792 --> 1:10:22.583
an unidentified vessel

1:10:22.625 --> 1:10:24.208
that's entered

1:10:22.625 --> 1:10:24.208
into orbit with us here.

1:10:24.250 --> 1:10:26.709
No ID, no answer

1:10:24.250 --> 1:10:26.709
to our signals.

1:10:26.750 --> 1:10:28.959
The old Bandi city's

1:10:26.750 --> 1:10:28.959
being hit hard, sir.

1:10:29.000 --> 1:10:32.333
Many casualties

1:10:29.000 --> 1:10:32.333
very probable.

1:10:29.000 --> 1:10:32.333
Understand, Commander.

1:10:32.375 --> 1:10:34.542
Would you object to

1:10:32.375 --> 1:10:34.542
your Captain ordering

1:10:34.583 --> 1:10:36.375
a clearly illegal kidnapping?

1:10:36.417 --> 1:10:38.834
No objection, sir.

1:10:38.875 --> 1:10:41.667
Groppler Zorn may have

1:10:38.875 --> 1:10:41.667
the answers we need.

1:10:41.709 --> 1:10:43.417
Get him-- bring him here.

1:10:43.458 --> 1:10:45.375
Aye, sir.

1:10:52.375 --> 1:10:55.250
They're forcing a very difficult

1:10:52.375 --> 1:10:55.250
decision on me, Counselor.

1:10:55.291 --> 1:10:58.542
But I doubt protecting

1:10:55.291 --> 1:10:58.542
the Bandi would violate

1:10:55.291 --> 1:10:58.542
the Prime Directive.

1:10:58.583 --> 1:11:00.583
True, they are not

1:10:58.583 --> 1:11:00.583
actual allies, but...

1:11:00.625 --> 1:11:04.750
We are in the midst of

1:11:00.625 --> 1:11:04.750
diplomatic discussions

1:11:00.625 --> 1:11:04.750
with them.

1:11:04.792 --> 1:11:07.875
Lieutenant, lock

1:11:04.792 --> 1:11:07.875
phasers on that vessel.

1:11:07.917 --> 1:11:10.583
Phasers locked on,

1:11:07.917 --> 1:11:10.583
Captain.

1:11:13.000 --> 1:11:15.667
Typical, so typical.

1:11:15.709 --> 1:11:19.041
Savage life-forms never follow

1:11:15.709 --> 1:11:19.041
even their own rules.

1:11:27.083 --> 1:11:29.375
Get off my Bridge!

1:11:29.417 --> 1:11:31.458
Interesting, that

1:11:29.417 --> 1:11:31.458
order about phasers.

1:11:31.500 --> 1:11:33.208
Standing by

1:11:31.500 --> 1:11:33.208
on phasers, Captain.

1:11:33.250 --> 1:11:36.041
Please, don't let me interfere.

1:11:33.250 --> 1:11:36.041
Use your weapons.

1:11:36.083 --> 1:11:37.625
With no idea of who

1:11:36.083 --> 1:11:37.625
is on that vessel,

1:11:37.667 --> 1:11:39.542
my order was a routine

1:11:37.667 --> 1:11:39.542
safety precaution.

1:11:39.583 --> 1:11:42.250
Really? No idea of

1:11:39.583 --> 1:11:42.250
what it represents?

1:11:42.291 --> 1:11:44.208
The meaning of that

1:11:42.291 --> 1:11:44.208
vessel is as plain...

1:11:44.250 --> 1:11:47.542
as plain as the noses

1:11:44.250 --> 1:11:47.542
on your ugly little

1:11:44.250 --> 1:11:47.542
primate faces.

1:11:47.583 --> 1:11:49.583
And if you were truly

1:11:47.583 --> 1:11:49.583
civilized, Captain,

1:11:49.625 --> 1:11:51.625
wouldn't you be doing something

1:11:49.625 --> 1:11:51.625
about the casualties

1:11:51.667 --> 1:11:53.917
happening down there?

1:11:53.959 --> 1:11:56.750
Captain to CMO.

1:11:53.959 --> 1:11:56.750
Are you reading any of this?

1:11:56.792 --> 1:11:59.583
Medical teams already preparing

1:11:56.792 --> 1:11:59.583
to beam down, Captain.

1:11:59.625 --> 1:12:01.792
Compliments

1:11:59.625 --> 1:12:01.792
on that, Doctor.

1:12:01.834 --> 1:12:03.750
Any questions?

1:12:03.792 --> 1:12:06.959
Starfleet people are trained

1:12:03.792 --> 1:12:06.959
to render aid and assistance

1:12:03.792 --> 1:12:06.959
whenever...

1:12:07.000 --> 1:12:09.166
But not trained

1:12:07.000 --> 1:12:09.166
in clear thinking.

1:12:09.208 --> 1:12:11.291
Let's consider

1:12:09.208 --> 1:12:11.291
<i>your</i> thoughts.

1:12:11.333 --> 1:12:13.125
You call us savages

1:12:11.333 --> 1:12:13.125
and yet you knew

1:12:13.166 --> 1:12:15.375
those people down there

1:12:13.166 --> 1:12:15.375
were going to be killed.

1:12:15.417 --> 1:12:17.583
It is<i> your</i> conduct

1:12:15.417 --> 1:12:17.583
that is uncivilized.

1:12:17.625 --> 1:12:20.583
Sir, they're firing

1:12:17.625 --> 1:12:20.583
on the planet again.

1:12:23.417 --> 1:12:24.875
Go to maneuvering jets.

1:12:24.917 --> 1:12:27.083
Position us between

1:12:24.917 --> 1:12:27.083
that vessel and the planet.

1:12:27.125 --> 1:12:28.834
Force fields full on.

1:12:28.875 --> 1:12:31.625
Aye, sir.

1:12:31.667 --> 1:12:33.834
Impulse power to...

1:12:34.875 --> 1:12:36.792
We have no ship control, sir.

1:12:38.542 --> 1:12:39.959
It's gone.

1:12:56.375 --> 1:12:58.166
Are you undamaged?

1:12:58.208 --> 1:13:00.291
Yes. You?

1:13:08.291 --> 1:13:10.458
All systems operating.

1:13:24.750 --> 1:13:28.625
(<i> sobbing</i> )

1:13:28.667 --> 1:13:31.500
Please. Make it stop!

1:13:31.542 --> 1:13:33.625
You can drive it away.

1:13:33.667 --> 1:13:36.083
Drive who away,

1:13:33.667 --> 1:13:36.083
Groppler?

1:13:36.125 --> 1:13:38.041
I don't know.

1:13:36.125 --> 1:13:38.041
DATA:

1:13:36.125 --> 1:13:38.041
Unlikely, sir.

1:13:38.083 --> 1:13:39.750
Our records show

1:13:38.083 --> 1:13:39.750
you supervised

1:13:39.792 --> 1:13:42.291
all Bandi contact

1:13:39.792 --> 1:13:42.291
with other worlds.

1:13:42.333 --> 1:13:44.000
We've done nothing wrong.

1:13:44.041 --> 1:13:46.333
Then if we can learn

1:13:44.041 --> 1:13:46.333
nothing from you...

1:13:46.375 --> 1:13:48.041
we'll leave.

1:13:48.083 --> 1:13:49.959
No! Oh, no, please,

1:13:48.083 --> 1:13:49.959
don't leave.

1:13:50.000 --> 1:13:52.917
I'll... try to explain.

1:13:52.959 --> 1:13:55.250
(<i> screaming</i> )

1:14:01.917 --> 1:14:04.083
First Officer

1:14:01.917 --> 1:14:04.083
to<i> Enterprise.</i>

1:14:06.917 --> 1:14:09.083
We've lost Zorn.

1:14:10.792 --> 1:14:12.583
Something like

1:14:10.792 --> 1:14:12.583
a transporter beam

1:14:12.625 --> 1:14:14.166
seems to have

1:14:12.625 --> 1:14:14.166
snatched him away.

1:14:14.208 --> 1:14:18.667
Question, sir.

1:14:14.208 --> 1:14:18.667
Could it be this Q?

1:14:18.709 --> 1:14:20.750
None of you knows

1:14:18.709 --> 1:14:20.750
who transported him.

1:14:20.792 --> 1:14:22.750
You're running out

1:14:20.792 --> 1:14:22.750
of time, Captain.

1:14:22.792 --> 1:14:26.834
Captain, suddenly

1:14:22.792 --> 1:14:26.834
I'm sensing something else.

1:14:29.083 --> 1:14:32.041
Satisfaction.

1:14:32.083 --> 1:14:34.166
Enormous satisfaction.

1:14:34.208 --> 1:14:36.542
PICARD:

1:14:34.208 --> 1:14:36.542
From the same source

1:14:34.208 --> 1:14:36.542
as before?

1:14:36.583 --> 1:14:38.166
No, that was on the planet.

1:14:38.208 --> 1:14:39.166
This is much closer.

1:14:39.208 --> 1:14:40.583
Excellent, Counselor.

1:14:40.625 --> 1:14:43.208
He's such a dullard,

1:14:40.625 --> 1:14:43.208
isn't he?

1:14:45.250 --> 1:14:46.959
Captain,

1:14:45.250 --> 1:14:46.959
from Transporter Room:

1:14:47.000 --> 1:14:49.250
First Officer and Mr. Data

1:14:47.000 --> 1:14:49.250
have beamed aboard.

1:14:49.291 --> 1:14:50.792
Excellent, also.

1:14:50.834 --> 1:14:52.625
Perhaps with more of

1:14:50.834 --> 1:14:52.625
these little minds helping...

1:14:52.667 --> 1:14:54.041
That is enough, damn it!

1:14:54.083 --> 1:14:56.083
Have you forgotten that

1:14:54.083 --> 1:14:56.083
we have an agreement?

1:14:56.125 --> 1:14:57.375
An agreement which

1:14:56.125 --> 1:14:57.375
you are, at this moment,

1:14:57.417 --> 1:14:59.208
breaking by taking

1:14:57.417 --> 1:14:59.208
over our vessel

1:14:59.250 --> 1:15:01.250
interfering with my decisions.

1:15:03.166 --> 1:15:04.834
Either leave or finish us!

1:15:04.875 --> 1:15:06.458
Temper, temper,

1:15:04.875 --> 1:15:06.458
<i>mon capitaine.</i>

1:15:06.500 --> 1:15:09.667
I'm merely trying to

1:15:06.500 --> 1:15:09.667
assist a pitiful species,

1:15:09.709 --> 1:15:11.667
but perhaps I will leave...

1:15:11.709 --> 1:15:14.250
if Commander Riker provides me

1:15:11.709 --> 1:15:14.250
with some amusement.

1:15:14.291 --> 1:15:15.834
Do nothing that he asks.

1:15:15.875 --> 1:15:19.041
But I ask so little,

1:15:15.875 --> 1:15:19.041
and it's so necessary

1:15:19.083 --> 1:15:20.583
if you're to

1:15:19.083 --> 1:15:20.583
solve all this.

1:15:20.625 --> 1:15:23.041
Beam over there with

1:15:20.625 --> 1:15:23.041
your what do you call it?

1:15:23.083 --> 1:15:24.542
Your "away team"?

1:15:24.583 --> 1:15:26.667
I'll risk none of my crew

1:15:24.583 --> 1:15:26.667
on that unknown.

1:15:26.709 --> 1:15:28.875
You should already know

1:15:26.709 --> 1:15:28.875
what you'll find there,

1:15:28.917 --> 1:15:32.166
but perhaps it's too adult

1:15:28.917 --> 1:15:32.166
a puzzle for you.

1:15:32.208 --> 1:15:35.667
With all respect, Captain,

1:15:32.208 --> 1:15:35.667
I want to beam over there.

1:15:35.709 --> 1:15:38.417
You show promise,

1:15:35.709 --> 1:15:38.417
my good fellow.

1:15:38.458 --> 1:15:41.709
Have you understood any part

1:15:38.458 --> 1:15:41.709
of what he's tried to tell you?

1:15:41.750 --> 1:15:44.709
Humanity is no longer

1:15:41.750 --> 1:15:44.709
a savage race.

1:15:46.083 --> 1:15:48.709
But you must still

1:15:46.083 --> 1:15:48.709
prove that.

1:15:54.875 --> 1:15:56.959
At least you impressed him,

1:15:54.875 --> 1:15:56.959
Number One.

1:15:57.000 --> 1:15:58.041
That's hopeful.

1:15:58.083 --> 1:16:00.792
Thank you, Captain.

1:16:02.291 --> 1:16:04.250
Captain, if he's not open

1:16:02.291 --> 1:16:04.250
to evidence in our favor,

1:16:04.291 --> 1:16:06.333
where will you go

1:16:04.291 --> 1:16:06.333
from there?

1:16:06.375 --> 1:16:07.917
I'll attend to my duty.

1:16:07.959 --> 1:16:09.250
To the bitter end?

1:16:09.291 --> 1:16:12.375
I see nothing

1:16:09.291 --> 1:16:12.375
so bitter about that.

1:16:19.000 --> 1:16:21.834
Can I help you, Captain?

1:16:21.875 --> 1:16:24.709
I, uh...

1:16:24.750 --> 1:16:28.625
I didn't want you thinking me

1:16:24.750 --> 1:16:28.625
harsh, cold-blooded.

1:16:28.667 --> 1:16:30.542
Why, oh, why

1:16:28.667 --> 1:16:30.542
would I ever think that?

1:16:30.583 --> 1:16:33.625
I didn't welcome you aboard

1:16:30.583 --> 1:16:33.625
personally, professionally.

1:16:33.667 --> 1:16:35.834
I made you come to me

1:16:33.667 --> 1:16:35.834
on the Bridge.

1:16:35.875 --> 1:16:37.583
I yelled at your son,

1:16:37.625 --> 1:16:40.792
who, as you pointed out,

1:16:37.625 --> 1:16:40.792
was quite correct.

1:16:40.834 --> 1:16:42.375
He does seem to have

1:16:42.417 --> 1:16:45.041
a very good grasp of

1:16:42.417 --> 1:16:45.041
starship operations.

1:16:45.083 --> 1:16:48.625
You've just won

1:16:45.083 --> 1:16:48.625
this mother's heart, Captain.

1:16:48.667 --> 1:16:50.750
Ah.

1:16:50.792 --> 1:16:54.750
But, now,

1:16:50.792 --> 1:16:54.750
your assignment here...

1:16:54.792 --> 1:16:57.375
I would...

1:16:57.417 --> 1:17:00.166
consider and approve

1:17:00.208 --> 1:17:02.709
a transfer for you.

1:17:02.750 --> 1:17:04.458
Oh.

1:17:04.500 --> 1:17:07.834
Do you consider me

1:17:04.500 --> 1:17:07.834
unqualified?

1:17:04.500 --> 1:17:07.834
Hardly.

1:17:07.875 --> 1:17:11.000
Your service record shows

1:17:07.875 --> 1:17:11.000
you're just the chief

1:17:07.875 --> 1:17:11.000
medical officer I want.

1:17:11.041 --> 1:17:12.959
Then you must object to me

1:17:11.041 --> 1:17:12.959
personally.

1:17:13.000 --> 1:17:15.667
I'm trying to be considerate

1:17:13.000 --> 1:17:15.667
of your feelings, Doctor.

1:17:15.709 --> 1:17:18.583
For you to work

1:17:15.709 --> 1:17:18.583
with a commanding officer

1:17:18.625 --> 1:17:20.834
who would

1:17:18.625 --> 1:17:20.834
continually remind you

1:17:20.875 --> 1:17:23.291
of a terrible,

1:17:20.875 --> 1:17:23.291
personal tragedy...

1:17:23.333 --> 1:17:25.542
If I had had any objections

1:17:23.333 --> 1:17:25.542
to serving with you,

1:17:25.583 --> 1:17:28.291
I wouldn't have requested

1:17:25.583 --> 1:17:28.291
this assignment, Captain.

1:17:28.333 --> 1:17:31.542
You requested this posting?

1:17:31.583 --> 1:17:34.250
My feelings about my husband's

1:17:31.583 --> 1:17:34.250
death will have no effect

1:17:34.291 --> 1:17:37.208
on the way I serve you,

1:17:34.291 --> 1:17:37.208
this vessel, or this mission.

1:17:39.291 --> 1:17:41.625
Ah.

1:17:41.667 --> 1:17:44.333
Then welcome aboard,

1:17:41.667 --> 1:17:44.333
Doctor.

1:17:44.375 --> 1:17:46.291
<i>Riker to Picard.</i>

1:17:46.333 --> 1:17:49.583
<i>We're ready to beam over, sir.</i>

1:17:49.625 --> 1:17:52.959
I, uh...I hope

1:17:49.625 --> 1:17:52.959
we can be friends.

1:17:53.000 --> 1:17:55.291
Thank you.

1:18:06.792 --> 1:18:08.583
Phasers on stun.

1:18:14.625 --> 1:18:16.166
Energize.

1:18:35.583 --> 1:18:37.500
Most interesting, sir.

1:18:39.417 --> 1:18:41.417
Much the same

1:18:39.417 --> 1:18:41.417
construction we saw

1:18:41.458 --> 1:18:43.000
in the underground tunnel.

1:18:43.041 --> 1:18:45.458
But no sound of power.

1:18:45.500 --> 1:18:47.500
No equipment.

1:18:47.542 --> 1:18:50.041
How does this ship run?

1:18:51.750 --> 1:18:54.542
(<i> gasp of pain</i> )

1:18:51.750 --> 1:18:54.542
What is it, Troi?

1:18:54.583 --> 1:18:56.917
Is it the same

1:18:54.583 --> 1:18:56.917
as you felt down there?

1:18:56.959 --> 1:18:58.709
No.

1:18:58.750 --> 1:19:01.917
This is much

1:18:58.750 --> 1:19:01.917
more powerful.

1:19:01.959 --> 1:19:05.583
Full of anger.

1:19:05.625 --> 1:19:07.542
Hate.

1:19:07.583 --> 1:19:08.959
Toward us?

1:19:09.000 --> 1:19:10.834
No.

1:19:10.875 --> 1:19:14.542
It's directed down

1:19:10.875 --> 1:19:14.542
toward the old Bandi city.

1:19:14.583 --> 1:19:16.667
Most intriguing

1:19:14.583 --> 1:19:16.667
again, sir.

1:19:16.709 --> 1:19:19.917
The place that

1:19:16.709 --> 1:19:19.917
this vessel was

1:19:16.709 --> 1:19:19.917
firing upon

1:19:19.959 --> 1:19:21.709
was not the

1:19:19.959 --> 1:19:21.709
Farpoint Starbase

1:19:21.750 --> 1:19:24.959
but the home of those

1:19:21.750 --> 1:19:24.959
who constructed...

1:19:26.750 --> 1:19:29.709
Sorry, sir.

1:19:29.750 --> 1:19:33.583
I seem to be

1:19:29.750 --> 1:19:33.583
commenting on everything.

1:19:33.625 --> 1:19:35.792
Good.

1:19:35.834 --> 1:19:37.667
Don't stop, my friend.

1:19:43.667 --> 1:19:46.000
<i>Enterprise,</i> Riker.

1:19:46.041 --> 1:19:50.166
This is turning out to be a very

1:19:46.041 --> 1:19:50.166
long tunnel or corridor, sir.

1:19:50.208 --> 1:19:52.000
No ship's crew in sight.

1:19:52.041 --> 1:19:54.875
No sign of mechanism

1:19:52.041 --> 1:19:54.875
or circuitry.

1:19:54.917 --> 1:19:57.750
No controls or readouts.

1:19:59.166 --> 1:20:02.458
This is nothing like

1:19:59.166 --> 1:20:02.458
any vessel I've seen before.

1:20:02.500 --> 1:20:04.792
Groppler Zorn, sir...

1:20:04.834 --> 1:20:07.959
in great fear, just ahead.

1:20:08.000 --> 1:20:11.834
There is a different feeling

1:20:08.000 --> 1:20:11.834
here than in the tunnel.

1:20:11.875 --> 1:20:14.250
Very different.

1:20:14.291 --> 1:20:18.959
ZORN (<i> in distance</i> ):

1:20:14.291 --> 1:20:18.959
No, please! No more, please!

1:20:19.000 --> 1:20:21.083
No more!

1:20:22.500 --> 1:20:26.625
Please, make it stop the pain!

1:20:26.667 --> 1:20:31.625
Please...

1:20:26.667 --> 1:20:31.625
make it stop the pain!

1:20:34.083 --> 1:20:36.208
No, please! No more!

1:20:36.250 --> 1:20:39.625
Please! No more!

1:20:39.667 --> 1:20:41.166
Please!

1:20:41.208 --> 1:20:42.959
Zorn, can you hear me?

1:20:43.000 --> 1:20:44.709
Make it stop the pain!

1:20:44.750 --> 1:20:47.750
(<i> screaming</i> )

1:20:47.792 --> 1:20:50.125
Has the alien communicated?

1:20:50.166 --> 1:20:52.041
Please!

1:20:52.083 --> 1:20:54.834
That's it, sir.

1:20:54.875 --> 1:20:58.000
It's just one alien

1:20:54.875 --> 1:20:58.000
I'm sensing here.

1:20:58.041 --> 1:21:01.667
Please, I don't understand

1:20:58.041 --> 1:21:01.667
what you want!

1:21:01.709 --> 1:21:03.125
Not true.

1:21:01.709 --> 1:21:03.125
He does know.

1:21:03.166 --> 1:21:06.041
ZORN:

1:21:03.166 --> 1:21:06.041
No, please! No more!

1:21:03.166 --> 1:21:06.041
Please! No more!

1:21:06.083 --> 1:21:09.500
(<i> crying</i> )

1:21:09.542 --> 1:21:12.959
No! Don't! Don't!

1:21:21.625 --> 1:21:23.208
Captain!

1:21:23.250 --> 1:21:26.500
PICARD:

1:21:23.250 --> 1:21:26.500
Transporter Chief,

1:21:23.250 --> 1:21:26.500
yank them back-- now!

1:21:27.500 --> 1:21:30.291
Riker, acknowledge.

1:21:30.333 --> 1:21:32.375
Your time is up, Captain.

1:21:32.417 --> 1:21:36.000
Transporter Chief,

1:21:32.417 --> 1:21:36.000
do you have their coordinates?

1:21:36.041 --> 1:21:38.250
Transporter Chief!

1:21:36.041 --> 1:21:38.250
He can't hear you, Captain.

1:21:38.291 --> 1:21:40.375
Transporter Chief, come in!

1:21:45.750 --> 1:21:49.625
I've people in trouble

1:21:45.750 --> 1:21:49.625
over there, Q.

1:21:55.500 --> 1:21:57.834
Everyone at ease.

1:21:55.500 --> 1:21:57.834
That's an order.

1:22:00.291 --> 1:22:04.291
Q, my people are in trouble.

1:22:04.333 --> 1:22:06.500
Let me help them, please.

1:22:11.208 --> 1:22:13.333
I'll do whatever you say.

1:22:20.250 --> 1:22:22.458
You'll do whatever I say?

1:22:25.291 --> 1:22:27.542
Seems I did make

1:22:25.291 --> 1:22:27.542
that bargain.

1:22:27.583 --> 1:22:29.208
The agreement

1:22:27.583 --> 1:22:29.208
isn't valid, sir.

1:22:29.250 --> 1:22:30.917
It wasn't Q that saved us.

1:22:30.959 --> 1:22:33.000
Save yourself.

1:22:30.959 --> 1:22:33.000
It may attack you now.

1:22:33.041 --> 1:22:35.875
It was<i> that</i> which

1:22:33.041 --> 1:22:35.875
sent us back, Captain.

1:22:35.917 --> 1:22:39.375
Yes, sir. It is not merely

1:22:35.917 --> 1:22:39.375
a vessel-- somehow it is alive.

1:22:39.417 --> 1:22:41.667
She lies! Destroy it

1:22:39.417 --> 1:22:41.667
while you have a chance.

1:22:41.709 --> 1:22:43.834
Make phasers and

1:22:41.709 --> 1:22:43.834
photon torpedoes ready.

1:22:43.875 --> 1:22:45.291
No, do nothing

1:22:43.875 --> 1:22:45.291
he demands.

1:22:45.333 --> 1:22:47.333
Captain, that thing

1:22:45.333 --> 1:22:47.333
was killing my people.

1:22:47.375 --> 1:22:49.792
Was there a reason?

1:22:47.375 --> 1:22:49.792
It is an unknown, Captain.

1:22:49.834 --> 1:22:51.417
Isn't that enough?

1:22:51.458 --> 1:22:53.625
If you'd earned that

1:22:51.458 --> 1:22:53.625
uniform you're wearing,

1:22:53.667 --> 1:22:56.417
you'd know that the unknown

1:22:53.667 --> 1:22:56.417
is what brings us out here.

1:22:56.458 --> 1:22:58.917
Wasted effort,

1:22:56.458 --> 1:22:58.917
considering human intelligence.

1:22:58.959 --> 1:23:00.625
Let's test that!

1:23:00.667 --> 1:23:03.125
Beginning with the tunnels you

1:23:00.667 --> 1:23:03.125
have under Farpoint, Groppler.

1:23:03.166 --> 1:23:06.583
Identical to those on the space

1:23:03.166 --> 1:23:06.583
vessel life-form over there.

1:23:06.625 --> 1:23:08.667
Why was it punishing you,

1:23:06.625 --> 1:23:08.667
Groppler?

1:23:08.709 --> 1:23:12.125
In return for some pain

1:23:08.709 --> 1:23:12.125
you've given another creature?

1:23:12.166 --> 1:23:13.834
We've done nothing wrong!

1:23:13.875 --> 1:23:15.709
It was injured.

1:23:13.875 --> 1:23:15.709
We helped it.

1:23:17.291 --> 1:23:20.208
Thank you.

1:23:20.250 --> 1:23:22.750
That was the

1:23:20.250 --> 1:23:22.750
missing element.

1:23:22.792 --> 1:23:27.542
Lieutenant Yar, rig main phaser

1:23:22.792 --> 1:23:27.542
banks to deliver an energy beam.

1:23:27.583 --> 1:23:28.750
Aye, sir.

1:23:28.792 --> 1:23:30.417
You're right, Captain.

1:23:30.458 --> 1:23:33.250
It has to be conceivable

1:23:30.458 --> 1:23:33.250
that somewhere in this galaxy

1:23:33.291 --> 1:23:36.750
there could exist creatures able

1:23:33.291 --> 1:23:36.750
to convert energy into matter.

1:23:36.792 --> 1:23:39.875
And into specific

1:23:36.792 --> 1:23:39.875
patterns of matter

1:23:39.917 --> 1:23:41.542
just as our transporters do.

1:23:41.583 --> 1:23:43.959
On the viewer, Captain.

1:24:18.291 --> 1:24:20.083
Groppler...

1:24:20.125 --> 1:24:24.709
you captured something

1:24:20.125 --> 1:24:24.709
like that, didn't you?

1:24:26.458 --> 1:24:30.000
Warn my people, please, to leave

1:24:26.458 --> 1:24:30.000
Farpoint Station immediately!

1:24:30.041 --> 1:24:31.417
He lies, Captain.

1:24:31.458 --> 1:24:33.000
Shouldn't you let

1:24:31.458 --> 1:24:33.000
his people die?

1:24:33.041 --> 1:24:34.333
Transmit the message:

1:24:34.375 --> 1:24:36.041
"Leave Farpoint Space

1:24:34.375 --> 1:24:36.041
Station immediately."

1:24:36.083 --> 1:24:38.375
TROI:

1:24:36.083 --> 1:24:38.375
Then it was a pair

1:24:36.083 --> 1:24:38.375
of creatures I was sensing--

1:24:38.417 --> 1:24:41.750
one down there

1:24:38.417 --> 1:24:41.750
in grief and pain,

1:24:41.792 --> 1:24:44.875
the other up here,

1:24:41.792 --> 1:24:44.875
filled with anger.

1:24:44.917 --> 1:24:47.208
DATA:

1:24:44.917 --> 1:24:47.208
And firing not on

1:24:44.917 --> 1:24:47.208
the new space station,

1:24:47.250 --> 1:24:50.542
but on the Bandi

1:24:47.250 --> 1:24:50.542
and their city.

1:24:50.583 --> 1:24:54.750
Attacking those

1:24:50.583 --> 1:24:54.750
who had captured...

1:24:56.291 --> 1:24:58.709
captured its mate.

1:25:05.041 --> 1:25:07.000
Energy beam ready, sir.

1:25:08.041 --> 1:25:09.959
Lock it in on

1:25:08.041 --> 1:25:09.959
Farpoint Station.

1:25:11.709 --> 1:25:15.208
I see now it was

1:25:11.709 --> 1:25:15.208
too simple a puzzle.

1:25:15.250 --> 1:25:19.000
Generosity has always

1:25:15.250 --> 1:25:19.000
been my... weakness.

1:25:19.041 --> 1:25:22.458
Let it have whatever

1:25:19.041 --> 1:25:22.458
it can absorb.

1:25:22.500 --> 1:25:25.125
Energize.

1:25:42.542 --> 1:25:45.041
Now getting feedback

1:25:42.542 --> 1:25:45.041
on the beam, sir.

1:25:45.083 --> 1:25:47.458
Discontinue it.

1:25:47.500 --> 1:25:49.500
Groppler Zorn...

1:25:49.542 --> 1:25:52.417
there will soon be

1:25:49.542 --> 1:25:52.417
no Farpoint Station

1:25:52.458 --> 1:25:53.959
if I'm right about this.

1:25:54.000 --> 1:25:56.000
Lucky guess!

1:26:14.667 --> 1:26:17.333
Please believe me,

1:26:17.375 --> 1:26:19.291
we meant no harm

1:26:17.375 --> 1:26:19.291
to the creature.

1:26:19.333 --> 1:26:20.792
It was starving for energy.

1:26:20.834 --> 1:26:23.000
Which your world furnishes

1:26:20.834 --> 1:26:23.000
you in plenty.

1:26:23.041 --> 1:26:24.500
And we did feed it.

1:26:24.542 --> 1:26:26.667
But only enough

1:26:24.542 --> 1:26:26.667
to keep it alive

1:26:26.709 --> 1:26:28.417
so that you could force

1:26:26.709 --> 1:26:28.417
it to shape itself

1:26:28.458 --> 1:26:30.583
into whatever

1:26:28.458 --> 1:26:30.583
form you needed.

1:27:45.250 --> 1:27:47.792
Sir...

1:27:47.834 --> 1:27:50.709
it's wonderful!

1:27:54.250 --> 1:27:57.458
A feeling of great joy...

1:27:59.250 --> 1:28:01.917
and gratitude.

1:28:05.500 --> 1:28:07.542
Great joy...

1:28:07.583 --> 1:28:10.250
and gratitude...

1:28:12.583 --> 1:28:15.542
from both of them.

1:28:33.625 --> 1:28:36.000
Why...

1:28:36.041 --> 1:28:39.583
do you use other life-forms

1:28:36.041 --> 1:28:39.583
for your recreation?

1:28:39.625 --> 1:28:41.834
If so, you've not

1:28:39.625 --> 1:28:41.834
provided the best...

1:28:41.875 --> 1:28:44.875
Leave us! We've passed

1:28:41.875 --> 1:28:44.875
your little test.

1:28:44.917 --> 1:28:47.333
Temper, temper,

1:28:44.917 --> 1:28:47.333
<i>mon capitaine.</i>

1:28:47.375 --> 1:28:49.000
Get off my ship.

1:28:49.041 --> 1:28:52.083
I do so only because

1:28:49.041 --> 1:28:52.083
it suits me to leave.

1:28:55.250 --> 1:28:58.583
But I will not promise

1:28:55.250 --> 1:28:58.583
never to appear again.

1:29:11.667 --> 1:29:15.750
<i>Captain's Log,</i>

1:29:11.667 --> 1:29:15.750
<i>Stardate 41174.2:</i>

1:29:15.792 --> 1:29:17.625
<i>The agreement</i>

1:29:15.792 --> 1:29:17.625
<i>for the rebuilding</i>

1:29:17.667 --> 1:29:20.083
<i>of Farpoint Station</i>

1:29:17.667 --> 1:29:20.083
<i>has been completed</i>

1:29:20.125 --> 1:29:21.750
<i>per my instructions.</i>

1:29:21.792 --> 1:29:23.041
All stations?

1:29:23.083 --> 1:29:25.041
Ready for departure, sir.

1:29:27.667 --> 1:29:29.291
Some problem, Riker?

1:29:29.333 --> 1:29:31.250
Just hoping this isn't

1:29:29.333 --> 1:29:31.250
the usual way

1:29:31.291 --> 1:29:32.792
our missions

1:29:31.291 --> 1:29:32.792
will go, sir.

1:29:32.834 --> 1:29:34.333
Oh, no, Number One.

1:29:34.375 --> 1:29:37.375
I'm sure most will be

1:29:34.375 --> 1:29:37.375
much more interesting.

1:29:40.333 --> 1:29:42.500
Let's see what's out there.

1:29:44.291 --> 1:29:45.375
Engage.
