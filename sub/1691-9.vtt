and got a job in the mailroom,

44:52.109 --> 44:53.484
I was very proud.

44:53.485 --> 44:55.236
So that's it then, right?

44:55.237 --> 44:56.946
Keep old Jimmy down in the mailroom.

44:56.947 --> 44:59.949
He's not good enough to be a lawyer.

44:59.950 --> 45:02.327
I know you.

45:02.328 --> 45:04.370
I know what you were, what you are.

45:04.371 --> 45:07.290
People don't change.
You're Slippin' Jimmy.

45:07.291 --> 45:09.334
And Slippin' Jimmy I can handle just fine.

45:09.335 --> 45:10.918
But Slippin' Jimmy with a law degree

45:10.919 --> 45:13.045
is like a chimp with a machine gun.

45:13.046 --> 45:15.547
The law is sacred!

45:15.548 --> 45:18.092
If you abuse that power, people get hurt.

45:18.093 --> 45:20.594
This is not a game.

45:20.595 --> 45:22.721
You have to know... On some level,

45:22.722 --> 45:24.682
I know you know I'm right.

45:24.683 --> 45:26.185
You know I'm right.

45:34.401 --> 45:37.195
I...

45:37.196 --> 45:40.198
I got you a 20-pound bag of ice.

45:40.199 --> 45:43.034
And some bacon, and some eggs,

45:43.035 --> 45:46.162
and a couple of those
steaks that you like.

45:46.163 --> 45:49.207
Some fuel canisters. It's
enough for three or four days.

45:49.208 --> 45:53.461
After that, you're on your own.

45:54.629 --> 45:56.589
I am done.

45:57.966 --> 46:00.634
Jimmy.

46:00.635 --> 46:02.262
Jimmy.

46:11.855 --> 46:13.440
Jimmy.

46:14.858 --> 46:17.027
Jimmy, come back inside.

46:21.489 --> 46:24.158
Jimmy.

46:24.159 --> 46:25.869
Jimmy.
