00:15.820 --> 00:18.219
She'll live.

00:23.039 --> 00:26.621
I can tell you now, I thought she wouldn't.

00:29.628 --> 00:33.710
I've brought up two of them.
This is my wife's first.

00:33.841 --> 00:36.609
She isn't battle-scarred yet.

00:37.679 --> 00:39.220
Doctor?

00:39.347 --> 00:41.390
Will my girl be all right?

00:41.725 --> 00:48.109
By morning she'll be knockin' down
Captain Keller's fences again.

00:49.024 --> 00:52.025
Is there nothing we should do?

00:52.152 --> 00:54.938
Put up stronger fencin'. Hm?

00:55.072 --> 00:59.400
Just let her get well.
She knows how better than we do.

01:00.849 --> 01:04.236
These things come and go in infants.
Never know why.

01:04.373 --> 01:07.042
Call it acute congestion
of the stomach and brain.

01:07.167 --> 01:09.206
I'll see you to your buggy, Doctor.

01:09.335 --> 01:11.375
Main thing is the fever's gone.

01:12.000 --> 01:14.921
I never saw a baby with more vitality.
That's the truth.

01:20.846 --> 01:23.302
(baby cries)

01:25.268 --> 01:27.599
Hush...

01:27.646 --> 01:29.685
Don't you cry now.

01:30.731 --> 01:33.188
You've been trouble enough.

01:35.945 --> 01:38.862
"Call it acute congestion" indeed!

01:38.989 --> 01:45.269
I don't see what's so cute about
a congestion just cos it's yours.

01:47.123 --> 01:51.701
We'll have your father
run an editorial in his paper.

01:51.836 --> 01:54.379
"The wonders of modern medicine."

01:54.715 --> 01:59.008
They don't know what they're curing
even when they cure it.

01:59.135 --> 02:02.219
Men! Men and their battle scars.

02:04.015 --> 02:06.257
We women have...

02:10.604 --> 02:12.645
Helen?

02:14.985 --> 02:17.024
(clicks fingers)

02:21.282 --> 02:23.322
Helen!

02:25.870 --> 02:26.530
Cap'n!

02:26.663 --> 02:29.332
(screaming)

02:29.457 --> 02:32.328
Cap'n! Will you come?

02:32.461 --> 02:35.794
- Katie! What is it? What's happened?
- (screaming)

02:37.340 --> 02:41.207
- Katie! What is it? What's wrong?
- Look! She can't see.

02:41.343 --> 02:44.629
Look at her eyes. She can't see.

02:44.764 --> 02:45.926
Helen!

02:46.057 --> 02:49.307
Or hear.
When I screamed she didn't blink.

02:49.436 --> 02:51.641
- Not an eyelash!
- Helen!

02:52.938 --> 02:56.189
- She can't hear you!
- Helen!

02:56.985 --> 02:59.025
Helen!

05:35.435 --> 05:37.891
I told you to let her be.

06:00.877 --> 06:02.916
(grunts)

06:04.005 --> 06:08.252
Arthur? Arthur, something
ought to be done for that child.

06:08.384 --> 06:10.673
A refreshin' suggestion. What?

06:10.803 --> 06:13.887
Why, this very famous
Perkins School in Boston.

06:14.016 --> 06:16.471
They're just supposed to do wonders.

06:16.600 --> 06:20.978
She's been to specialists. They couldn't
help her in Baltimore or Washington.

06:21.105 --> 06:23.858
I think the Cap'n will write
to the Perkins School soon.

06:23.983 --> 06:26.620
Katie, how many times
can you break your heart?

06:26.653 --> 06:31.232
Any number of times, as long as there's
the least chance for her to see or hear.

06:31.365 --> 06:34.036
- What, child?
- There isn't! I must finish here.

06:34.161 --> 06:37.908
With your permission, Cap'n, I would
like to write to the Perkins School.

06:38.040 --> 06:39.497
I said no, Kate.

06:39.624 --> 06:42.079
(older woman)
Writing does no harm, Arthur.

06:42.209 --> 06:45.459
- A little bitty letter to see if they can help.
- They can't.

06:46.389 --> 06:48.754
(Kate) We won't know that to be a fact
till after you write.

06:48.884 --> 06:50.539
They can't.

06:50.677 --> 06:52.716
Katie...

06:55.264 --> 06:57.838
- I might as well work in a hen yard.
- (baby cries)

06:57.975 --> 07:00.762
- You really ought to put her away, Father.
- What?

07:00.896 --> 07:04.394
- Some asylum. It's the kindest thing.
- She is your sister, James.

07:04.740 --> 07:07.858
Half-sister and half... mentally defective.

07:07.985 --> 07:11.437
She can't keep herself clean.
It's not pleasant to see her about.

07:12.230 --> 07:15.653
Do you dare complain
of what you can see?

07:15.786 --> 07:19.783
This discussion's at an end. The house
is at sixes and sevens over the child.

07:19.915 --> 07:22.487
I want some peace here. I don't care how.

07:22.625 --> 07:26.125
But we won't have it by rushin' about
the country to every new quack.

07:26.254 --> 07:28.923
- I'm as sensible to this affliction as...
- Helen!

07:29.048 --> 07:31.088
My buttons.

07:48.694 --> 07:51.149
Eyes.

07:51.278 --> 07:53.949
She wants the doll to have eyes.

08:06.336 --> 08:09.004
My goodness me. I'm not decent.

08:09.130 --> 08:13.875
She doesn't know better, Aunt Ev.
I'll sew 'em on again.

08:19.265 --> 08:22.509
It's worth a couple of buttons, Kate. Look.

08:22.686 --> 08:25.806
This child has more sense
than all these men Kellers,

08:25.938 --> 08:28.429
if there's ever a way
to reach that mind of hers.

08:29.169 --> 08:30.109
- Helen!
- (baby cries)

08:30.235 --> 08:34.730
Helen! You're not to do such things.
How can I make you understand?

08:34.865 --> 08:36.407
Katie!

08:36.830 --> 08:40.197
How can I get it
into your head, my darling?

08:40.327 --> 08:42.735
Katie, she must be taught
some discipline.

08:42.873 --> 08:45.279
Discipline an afflicted child?
Is it her fault?

08:45.708 --> 08:47.451
I didn't say it was.

08:48.360 --> 08:51.120
How can I teach her?
Beat her till she's black and blue?

08:51.255 --> 08:54.340
It's not safe. There must be
some way of confinin' her.

08:54.467 --> 08:58.086
In a cage? She's a growin' child.
She has to use her limbs.

08:58.221 --> 09:00.926
Answer me one thing.
Is it fair to the baby?

09:01.057 --> 09:04.460
Are you willing to put her away?

09:05.062 --> 09:07.100
Now what?

09:07.230 --> 09:09.638
She wants to talk like...

09:10.817 --> 09:12.940
be like you and me.

09:24.038 --> 09:26.908
Every day she slips further away.

09:30.796 --> 09:33.287
I don't know how to call her back.

09:33.423 --> 09:37.124
I do have a mind
to write to Boston myself.

09:37.259 --> 09:43.049
If that school can't help her,
maybe they'll send somebody who can.

09:44.809 --> 09:47.182
I'll write to Perkins, Katie.

09:50.315 --> 09:52.355
(makes guttural sound)

09:53.769 --> 09:55.602
Train to New York!

09:57.210 --> 09:59.027
And south!

09:59.157 --> 10:01.482
It will no doubt be difficult for you there.

10:01.618 --> 10:04.653
(conductor) All aboard!

10:06.206 --> 10:08.609
This is my last time to counsel you, Annie.

10:08.667 --> 10:12.035
You do lack some -
and by some I mean all - what?

10:12.169 --> 10:15.621
Tact. All talent to bend to others.

10:15.756 --> 10:18.331
What has saved you
more than once at Perkins

10:18.467 --> 10:21.302
is that there was nowhere to expel you to.

10:21.429 --> 10:24.460
- Your eyes hurt?
- My ears, Mr Anagnos.

10:24.725 --> 10:28.070
Nowhere but to that dreadful place
where you grew up learning to be saucy!

10:28.687 --> 10:31.225
Annie, I know how unhappy
it was for you there,

10:31.355 --> 10:34.938
but that battle is dead and done with.
Why not let it stay buried?

10:35.067 --> 10:37.773
- I think God must owe me a resurrection.
- What?

10:37.903 --> 10:41.772
- He keeps digging up that battle.
- That is not a proper thing to say.

10:41.908 --> 10:47.115
Be humble. You'll need their affection
working with this child.

10:48.899 --> 10:51.292
A gift, with our affection.

11:00.009 --> 11:01.793
Dear Mr Anagnos.

11:06.265 --> 11:09.966
Well... What should I say?

11:10.102 --> 11:14.100
I'm an ignorant, opinionated girl,
and everything I am I owe to you?

11:14.231 --> 11:16.722
That is only half-true, Annie.

11:16.860 --> 11:18.402
Which half?

11:19.946 --> 11:21.441
Good luck.

11:22.230 --> 11:24.408
Goodbye, goodbye. Goodbye.

11:24.840 --> 11:30.620
I won't give them any trouble. I'll be
so ladylike they won't notice I've come!

12:56.340 --> 12:59.309
- (child) Where are we going, Annie?
- Jimmy...

12:59.712 --> 13:04.837
- Where are we going?
- I said I'm taking care of you.

13:04.967 --> 13:05.964
Where are we going?

13:06.094 --> 13:08.383
(man) Annie Sullivan, aged nine,
virtually blind.

13:08.629 --> 13:12.842
James Sullivan, aged seven.
What's the matter with your leg, sonny?

13:12.975 --> 13:15.727
(Annie) It's his hip, mister.
He was born that way.

13:15.854 --> 13:20.018
(man) Can't he walk without a crutch? Girl
to the women's ward, boy to the men's.

13:20.149 --> 13:23.317
Annie! Annie, don't let them take me!

13:23.445 --> 13:24.903
Annie! Annie...

13:25.029 --> 13:27.068
(train whistle)

13:44.799 --> 13:46.839
Tuscumbia!

13:47.802 --> 13:49.841
Tuscumbia!

13:52.807 --> 13:54.966
- Miss Sullivan?
- Here.

13:55.101 --> 13:59.312
At last. I thought the trains must be
backing up every time I dozed off.

13:59.438 --> 14:03.602
- I'm James Keller.
- James? I had a brother Jimmy.

14:03.735 --> 14:06.820
- Are you Helen's?
- I'm only half her brother.

14:06.947 --> 14:10.446
- You're to be her governess?
- Well, try.

14:11.951 --> 14:14.442
You look like half a governess.

14:15.289 --> 14:17.745
- You have a trunk, Miss Sullivan?
- Yes.

14:28.759 --> 14:30.799
Mrs Keller.

14:53.850 --> 14:55.740
We've met every train for two days.

14:57.288 --> 15:00.158
You didn't bring Helen.
I was hoping you would.

15:00.292 --> 15:02.331
No, she's home.

15:03.754 --> 15:08.560
- You live far from town, Mrs Keller?
- Only a mile.

15:08.674 --> 15:11.759
Well, I suppose I could wait
one more mile.

15:11.886 --> 15:16.370
But don't be surprised
if I get out and push the horse.

15:28.445 --> 15:32.145
- Welcome to lvy Green, Miss Sullivan.
- My husband, Miss Annie. Cap'n Keller.

15:32.282 --> 15:34.210
- Captain, how do you do?
- Pleasure to see you.

15:34.701 --> 15:37.701
- I trust you had an agreeable journey.
- Oh, I had several.

15:37.828 --> 15:41.115
- Where do you want the trunk?
- Where Miss Sullivan can get at it.

15:41.249 --> 15:43.371
- Yes. Where's Helen?
- And the suitcase.

15:43.700 --> 15:46.787
I'll take that. I've got something
for Helen. When do I see her?

15:46.922 --> 15:50.409
(Kate) There. There's Helen.

15:59.225 --> 16:01.467
- (Captain) Katie...
- Sh.

18:22.859 --> 18:26.629
- She's very rough, Katie.
- I like her, Cap'n.

18:26.664 --> 18:29.037
How old is she?

18:29.166 --> 18:31.919
Well, she's not in her teens, you know.

18:32.045 --> 18:36.753
Why does she wear those glasses? I like
to see a person's eyes when I talk to 'em.

18:36.883 --> 18:40.251
- For the sun. She was blind.
- Blind?

18:40.386 --> 18:44.964
She had nine operations on her eyes.
One just before she left.

18:45.099 --> 18:49.144
Blind? Good heavens! They expect
one blind child to teach another?

18:49.270 --> 18:52.141
How long did she teach there?

18:52.273 --> 18:54.313
She was a pupil.

18:54.442 --> 18:57.313
This is her first position?

18:57.445 --> 18:59.484
She was valedictorian.

18:59.614 --> 19:01.903
A houseful of grown-ups
can't cope with Helen.

19:02.032 --> 19:04.650
How can a half-blind Yankee
schoolgirl manage?

19:04.661 --> 19:06.950
Great improvement.
Now we have two of them.

19:07.079 --> 19:09.750
- You be quiet.
- I was agreeing with you.

19:09.875 --> 19:12.329
You talk too much.

19:13.836 --> 19:17.869
- Nothing I say is right.
- Why say anything?

19:33.230 --> 19:36.730
All the trouble I went to
and that's how I look?

19:59.090 --> 20:01.130
Oh, no, not the drawers.

20:04.261 --> 20:06.301
(doll makes sound)

20:43.759 --> 20:46.631
All right, Miss O'Sullivan, let's begin.

20:46.762 --> 20:48.885
With doll.

20:49.016 --> 20:51.055
D...

20:58.692 --> 21:00.730
O...

21:05.819 --> 21:08.220
L...

21:12.288 --> 21:14.327
L.

21:18.127 --> 21:19.751
Doll.

21:19.880 --> 21:21.919
You spell pretty well.

21:27.971 --> 21:31.257
Finding out if she's ticklish? She is.

21:33.852 --> 21:36.769
- What is it, a game?
- An alphabet.

21:36.896 --> 21:38.610
Alphabet?

21:38.647 --> 21:40.688
For the deaf.

22:11.097 --> 22:15.924
- How bright she is.
- You think she knows what she's doing?

22:29.240 --> 22:31.481
She's a monkey. She imitates everything.

22:31.617 --> 22:35.819
Yes, she's a bright little monkey, all right.

22:47.259 --> 22:49.832
She wants her doll back.

22:49.970 --> 22:53.255
- When she spells it.
- She doesn't know the thing has a name.

22:53.390 --> 22:58.051
Of course not. Who expects her to now?
All I want is her fingers to learn the letters.

22:58.185 --> 23:00.079
Won't mean anything to her.

23:00.689 --> 23:03.643
She doesn't like that alphabet.
You invent it yourself?

23:03.775 --> 23:09.180
Spanish monks under a vow of silence -
which I wish you'd take.

23:16.997 --> 23:19.451
Yes... Yes!

23:23.670 --> 23:26.338
C...

23:26.464 --> 23:28.872
A...

23:29.009 --> 23:31.463
K...

23:32.450 --> 23:33.634
E.

23:39.435 --> 23:40.846
Yes.

23:40.979 --> 23:45.392
You do as my fingers do.
Never mind what it means.

23:52.365 --> 23:54.404
Now...

23:58.329 --> 24:00.368
D...

24:03.930 --> 24:06.329
O...

24:07.463 --> 24:09.900
L...

24:13.470 --> 24:16.400
L.

24:18.141 --> 24:20.181
Think it over.

24:50.214 --> 24:52.255
L.

24:55.095 --> 24:59.299
Imitate now. Understand later.
End of the first lesson.

24:59.641 --> 25:01.051
Ow!

25:01.183 --> 25:06.011
Oh, you little wretch.
Nobody's taught you any manners.

25:11.111 --> 25:13.150
Helen? Helen!

25:15.699 --> 25:18.023
Helen! Helen, let me out...

25:36.428 --> 25:39.214
Don't worry, they'll find you.
You're not lost.

25:39.346 --> 25:41.386
Only out of place.

25:47.271 --> 25:49.098
And toothless!

25:51.984 --> 25:54.393
- Where's Miss Sullivan?
- Locked in her room.

25:54.789 --> 25:55.988
Locked in her...?

25:56.114 --> 26:00.250
- Helen locked her in and took the key.
- And you sit here and say nothing?

26:00.701 --> 26:03.372
Everyone's been telling me
not to say anything.

26:03.497 --> 26:07.625
- Viney, look out front for Helen.
- She's out by the pump!

26:07.750 --> 26:08.829
I'll look.

26:08.960 --> 26:12.246
- Miss Sullivan.
- Yes, Captain Keller.

26:12.381 --> 26:14.622
Is there no key on your side?

26:14.758 --> 26:17.627
If there were a key, I wouldn't be in here.
Helen took it.

26:17.760 --> 26:19.919
The only thing on my side is me.

26:20.055 --> 26:24.432
Not in the house ten minutes.
I don't see how you managed it.

26:25.089 --> 26:26.800
And even I'm not on my side.

26:26.936 --> 26:29.308
- Viney!
- Yes, sir, Captain Keller?

26:29.439 --> 26:32.226
Put that meat back in the oven!

26:33.442 --> 26:37.488
- She has no key.
- Nonsense. You searched in her pockets?

26:37.614 --> 26:40.733
- Yes. She doesn't have it.
- Katie, she must have the key.

26:41.849 --> 26:44.986
- Take that ladder back!
- Certainly.

26:45.122 --> 26:46.948
- She could have hidden it.
- Where?

26:47.082 --> 26:49.288
Anywhere. Under a stone...

26:49.416 --> 26:52.750
I can't plough up the entire grounds
to find a missin' key.

26:52.878 --> 26:54.954
Jimmy! Bring me a ladder!

26:55.089 --> 26:56.916
Certainly.

26:57.884 --> 27:00.256
- (baby crying)
- What's the baby doing up?

27:00.386 --> 27:03.173
Captain woke her, Miss Kate.
All that hollerin'.

27:03.306 --> 27:05.215
(whistles)

27:05.349 --> 27:07.390
Get back to your work!

27:13.191 --> 27:16.726
- Miss Sullivan!
- Yes, Captain Keller?

27:16.862 --> 27:19.816
- Come onto the roof.
- You have a ladder. How thoughtful.

27:19.948 --> 27:21.904
Come down, Miss Sullivan.

27:22.032 --> 27:24.026
- I don't see how I can.
- I'll carry you.

27:24.161 --> 27:28.028
- It's very chivalrous, but...
- Miss Sullivan, follow instructions.

27:28.164 --> 27:30.951
I will not have you also
tumblin' out of our windows.

27:31.084 --> 27:35.829
I hope this is not what we may expect in
simplifyin' the work of looking after Helen.

27:35.963 --> 27:39.213
Captain Keller, I'm able to go down
a ladder under my own steam.

27:39.342 --> 27:41.599
Miss Sullivan, I doubt it.

27:41.635 --> 27:43.759
Simply hold onto my neck.

27:46.724 --> 27:49.298
My neck, Miss Sullivan!

27:50.394 --> 27:53.064
- I'm sorry to inconvenience you.
- No inconvenience.

27:53.190 --> 27:57.934
Other than taking that door down and
replacing the lock, if we can't find the key.

27:58.069 --> 28:00.108
- I'll look everywhere.
- Thank you.

28:00.238 --> 28:03.442
Do not look in any rooms
that can be locked.

28:04.250 --> 28:05.200
There!

28:06.327 --> 28:11.202
Go, go! What are you looking at?
Nothing for you to look at.

28:11.333 --> 28:12.494
- Now...
- (baby cries)

28:12.625 --> 28:16.125
Would it be possible for us
to have dinner like other people?

28:17.380 --> 28:21.000
- Miss Sullivan!
- Viney, I'll put the baby to sleep.

28:24.450 --> 28:28.423
Oh... Might as well leave the l-a-d-d-e-r.

29:06.471 --> 29:08.609
You devil.

29:19.108 --> 29:22.856
Oh, you think I'm so easily gotten rid of?

29:22.988 --> 29:25.359
You've got a thing or two to learn first.

29:25.490 --> 29:28.407
I've got nothing else to do,

29:28.849 --> 29:32.829
- and nowhere to go.
- (Captain) Miss Sullivan!

29:37.461 --> 29:41.672
Discipline her

29:41.798 --> 29:45.712
without breaking...

29:50.059 --> 29:52.460
(gasps)

30:00.483 --> 30:02.730
Ink.

30:11.369 --> 30:13.825
Ink.

30:13.954 --> 30:15.994
It has a name.

30:35.690 --> 30:40.630
Down, under, up.
And be careful of the needle.

30:46.989 --> 30:52.659
Right. You keep out of the ink and
perhaps I can keep out of the soup.

30:55.705 --> 30:57.946
(gasps)

30:59.375 --> 31:03.160
All right, all right. Let's try temperance.

31:10.303 --> 31:13.090
Bad...

31:13.222 --> 31:15.262
girl.

31:50.301 --> 31:53.053
Good...

31:53.180 --> 31:55.219
girl.

32:18.622 --> 32:20.661
Yes.

32:36.807 --> 32:38.846
Very good girl.

33:16.346 --> 33:21.257
- (Kate) What are you saying to her?
- I was just making conversation.

33:21.934 --> 33:24.400
Saying it was a sewing card.

33:24.645 --> 33:27.102
Does that mean that to her?

33:27.231 --> 33:32.605
Oh, no. She won't know what spelling is
till she knows what a word is.

33:34.196 --> 33:38.277
The Cap'n says it's like
spellin' to a fence post.

33:39.326 --> 33:41.153
Does he, now?

33:41.288 --> 33:43.030
- Is it?
- No.

33:43.164 --> 33:46.035
It's how I watch you talk to the baby.

33:46.167 --> 33:48.290
- The baby?
- Any baby.

33:48.420 --> 33:52.916
It's gibberish. Grown-up gibberish.
Baby-talk gibberish.

33:53.050 --> 33:56.589
Do they understand
one word of it to start?

33:56.677 --> 34:01.423
Somehow they begin to if they hear it.
I'm letting Helen hear it.

34:02.079 --> 34:06.349
Other children are not... impaired.

34:06.478 --> 34:11.853
Oh, there's nothing impaired in that head.
It works like a mousetrap.

34:14.195 --> 34:16.864
And... when will she learn?

34:19.826 --> 34:21.864
Maybe after a million words.

34:24.289 --> 34:29.331
Perhaps you'd like to read Dr Howe
on the question of words.

34:38.677 --> 34:45.844
I should like also
to learn those... letters, Miss Annie.

34:47.143 --> 34:49.766
I'll teach them to you tomorrow morning.

34:49.898 --> 34:52.981
That makes only half a million each.

34:54.777 --> 34:56.817
- It's her bedtime.
- Yes.

35:00.840 --> 35:01.648
Ow!

35:01.784 --> 35:02.947
I'm sorry.

35:03.077 --> 35:05.117
(makes guttural sounds)

35:11.335 --> 35:14.704
Why does she get a reward
for stabbing me?

35:14.840 --> 35:18.920
There are so many times
she simply cannot be compelled.

35:20.637 --> 35:22.844
Yes.

35:22.972 --> 35:25.677
I'm the same way myself.

35:28.103 --> 35:30.143
Good night.

36:00.302 --> 36:03.052
(James) Shouldn't we give
the devil his due, Father?

36:03.179 --> 36:07.474
We lost the South two years earlier
when he outthought us behind Vicksburg.

36:07.601 --> 36:09.724
Outthought is a peculiar word
for a butcher.

36:09.853 --> 36:12.224
- Harness-maker, wasn't he?
- I said butcher.

36:12.355 --> 36:16.934
His strength as a soldier was numbers.
He led them to slaughter like sheep.

36:17.068 --> 36:20.936
- But even if he was a butcher...
- And a drunk, half the war.

36:21.072 --> 36:23.907
Agreed, Father.
If his own people said he was...

36:24.034 --> 36:26.905
What is it you find to admire
in such a man, Jimmy?

36:27.036 --> 36:31.248
- The drunkenness or the butchery?
- Neither, Father. Only that he beat us.

36:31.375 --> 36:34.375
- He didn't.
- Are you saying we won the war, sir?

36:34.699 --> 36:38.666
He didn't beat us at Vicksburg.
We lost it by stupidity vergin' on treason.

36:38.798 --> 36:43.295
(James) We lost it because Grant was
one thing no Yankee general was before...

36:43.427 --> 36:44.629
Drunk? I doubt it.

36:44.679 --> 36:46.099
- Obstinate.
- Obstinate?

36:46.639 --> 36:51.349
None of 'em compare with old Stonewall.
If he was there we'd still have Vicksburg.

36:51.478 --> 36:54.764
(James) The butcher wouldn't give up.
He tried four ways...

36:54.898 --> 36:57.139
(Captain) If we'd had
a Southerner in command

36:57.275 --> 37:02.159
instead of a half-breed Yankee traitor
like Pemberton... What's the matter?

37:02.697 --> 37:06.909
Miss Annie, she's accustomed
to helping herself from our plates.

37:07.034 --> 37:10.985
- I'm not accustomed to it.
- Of course not. Viney!

37:11.123 --> 37:14.159
- Jimmy, give her something.
- Her table manners are her best.

37:14.291 --> 37:17.992
Let her this time. It's the only way
we get any adult conversation.

37:18.130 --> 37:20.702
- I'll get another plate.
- I have one, thank you.

37:20.840 --> 37:25.300
Viney! What Cap'n Keller says is only
too true. She'll persist in this till...

37:25.427 --> 37:30.090
- I have a plate. I intend to keep it.
- You see why they took Vicksburg?

37:30.224 --> 37:33.309
A plate is no matter
to struggle with a deprived child about.

37:33.436 --> 37:36.936
- I'd sooner have a more heroic issue.
- I really must insist...

37:37.065 --> 37:38.809
- She's hurt herself.
- She hasn't.

37:38.942 --> 37:42.987
- Will you please let her hands go?
- You don't know her well enough...

37:43.112 --> 37:46.315
I know a tantrum when I see one
and a badly spoiled child.

37:46.449 --> 37:47.362
Hear, hear.

37:47.492 --> 37:50.161
You'd have more understanding
if you had some pity.

37:50.286 --> 37:53.987
Pity? For this tyrant?
The whole house turns on her whims.

37:54.123 --> 37:56.164
Is there anything she doesn't get?

37:56.293 --> 38:00.954
What I pity is that the sun won't rise and
set for her, and you're telling her it will.

38:01.088 --> 38:03.626
What good will your pity do
when you're gone?

38:03.759 --> 38:07.257
- Kate, for the love of heaven...
- I don't think it serves...

38:07.387 --> 38:11.550
Serves you good. It's less trouble
to feel sorry than to teach her anything...

38:11.641 --> 38:13.717
You haven't taught her anything yet.

38:13.851 --> 38:16.177
- I'll begin now if you leave the room.
- Leave?

38:16.313 --> 38:19.266
- Everyone, please!
- You are a paid teacher, nothing more.

38:19.398 --> 38:23.016
I can't unteach her six years of pity
if you can't stand up to one tantrum.

38:23.152 --> 38:25.905
Old Stonewall indeed!

38:26.030 --> 38:29.233
Mrs Keller, you promised me help.
Leave me alone with her now.

38:29.367 --> 38:31.239
Katie, come outside with me at once!

38:31.702 --> 38:34.454
- Heaven's sakes!
- Out, please.

38:38.340 --> 38:40.335
If it takes all summer, General!

38:41.880 --> 38:45.414
I've a mind to ship her back to Boston,
and you can inform her so for me.

38:46.010 --> 38:47.342
- I, Cap'n?
- She's a hireling.

38:47.469 --> 38:50.137
Unless there's a complete
change of manner,

38:50.262 --> 38:53.134
she goes back on the next train.
Will you make that clear?

38:53.266 --> 38:56.766
Where will you be, Cap'n,
while I am making it clear?

38:56.894 --> 38:58.934
At the office.

39:04.693 --> 39:09.487
Will you? I thought what she said
was exceptionally intelligent.

39:09.615 --> 39:13.400
- I've been sayin' it for years.
- To his face?

39:15.454 --> 39:18.900
Or will you take it, Jimmy, as a flag?

39:23.338 --> 39:25.378
(banging)

41:14.240 --> 41:16.280
(makes guttural sounds)

43:29.835 --> 43:31.873
(stamps feet)

45:57.983 --> 46:00.021
(yells)

47:32.911 --> 47:36.260
Good girl, Helen.

47:36.706 --> 47:38.829
Agh!

47:45.882 --> 47:47.922
(clock striking)

47:51.304 --> 47:54.340
I don't see how you can wait here
a minute longer, Kate.

47:54.474 --> 47:57.427
This could go on all afternoon too.

47:58.894 --> 48:01.681
I'll tell the Cap'n you called.

48:09.697 --> 48:14.110
Give me her, Miss Kate.
I'll sneak her in back to her crib.

48:16.829 --> 48:19.402
- She never gives me a minute's worry.
- Oh, yes.

48:19.909 --> 48:23.039
This one's the angel of the family.
No question about that.

48:33.137 --> 48:36.802
- What happened?
- She ate from her own plate.

48:36.932 --> 48:39.934
She ate with a spoon... herself.

48:40.603 --> 48:42.844
And she folded her napkin.

48:44.106 --> 48:46.146
Folded her napkin?

48:46.777 --> 48:50.311
The room's a wreck,
but her napkin is folded.

48:51.155 --> 48:53.646
I'll be in my room, Mrs Keller.

48:53.782 --> 48:58.789
Don't be long, Miss Annie.
Dinner'll be ready right away.

49:15.806 --> 49:17.844
Folded her napkin...

49:20.434 --> 49:23.601
My Helen folded her napkin?

50:00.766 --> 50:02.806
(clattering)

50:05.719 --> 50:07.063
(screaming)

50:07.190 --> 50:09.349
(woman) There's school.

50:09.483 --> 50:12.021
- There is school.
- (woman #2) There is not.

50:12.153 --> 50:15.190
What lies are you telling
the ignorant girl, you old loon?

50:15.322 --> 50:17.695
They teach blind ones worse than her.

50:17.826 --> 50:21.443
- To do what? See with their nose?
- To read and write.

50:22.300 --> 50:24.248
How can they read and write
if they can't see?

50:24.373 --> 50:27.327
- (screaming)
- You crazy old Mick.

50:31.840 --> 50:33.666
(banging)

50:33.800 --> 50:36.255
(Jimmy) You ain't going to school, Annie?

50:36.385 --> 50:37.715
When I grow up.

50:37.846 --> 50:41.925
You ain't either, Annie. You're going
to stay here, take care of me.

50:42.059 --> 50:43.802
I'm going to school when I grow up.

50:43.936 --> 50:47.579
You said we'd be together
for ever and ever and ever.

50:47.646 --> 50:51.858
I'm going to school when I grow up!
Now leave me be.

51:08.083 --> 51:12.414
"Can nothing be done
to disinter this human soul?"

51:17.610 --> 51:20.569
"The whole neighbourhood
would rush to save this woman

51:20.679 --> 51:25.342
if she were buried alive
by the caving in of a pit,

51:25.476 --> 51:29.059
and labour with zeal
until she were dug out."

51:29.940 --> 51:35.181
"Now, if there were one
who had as much patience as zeal,

51:35.320 --> 51:37.360
he might awaken her..."

51:47.666 --> 51:50.335
- (woman) They're all here.
- (woman #2) Talk to them.

51:50.460 --> 51:52.619
- (woman #3) You can get out.
- Talk to them.

51:52.753 --> 51:55.389
(woman) All the investigators is here.

51:55.715 --> 51:59.630
- That's Mr Sanborn.
- He's the commissioner. Talk to him.

51:59.760 --> 52:01.338
You might get out.

52:01.471 --> 52:03.130
Mr Sanborn?

52:03.264 --> 52:06.135
Mr Sanborn, I want to go to school.

52:13.858 --> 52:18.936
"...might awaken her to a consciousness
of her immortal nature."

52:19.072 --> 52:21.989
"The chance is small indeed,

52:22.117 --> 52:27.657
but with a smaller chance they would
have dug desperately for her in the pit."

52:27.789 --> 52:33.246
"And is the life of the soul
of less import than that of the body?"

53:32.311 --> 53:35.347
Let alone the question of
who's to pay for the broken dishware.

53:35.731 --> 53:38.768
From the moment she came,
she's been nothing but a burden.

53:38.902 --> 53:42.981
Incompetent, impertinent,
ineffectual, immodest and...

53:43.114 --> 53:45.619
She folded her napkin, Cap'n.

53:45.659 --> 53:48.260
- She what?
- Not ineffectual.

53:48.702 --> 53:51.074
Helen did fold her napkin.

53:51.206 --> 53:54.373
What is so extraordinary
about foldin' a napkin?

53:54.599 --> 53:56.992
Well, it's more than you did, Cap'n.

53:57.128 --> 53:58.753
Katie...

53:58.880 --> 54:02.309
Today she scuttled any chance
of gettin' along with the child.

54:02.717 --> 54:05.884
If you can see any point in her staying,
it's more than I can.

54:06.012 --> 54:09.927
- What do you wish me to do?
- I want you to give her notice.

54:11.016 --> 54:14.766
- I can't.
- Then if you won't, I must.

54:20.152 --> 54:21.119
(whimpering)

54:21.695 --> 54:24.019
(Captain Keller shouting)

54:32.789 --> 54:35.909
(Captain Keller shouting)

54:39.670 --> 54:40.833
Miss Sullivan?

54:40.963 --> 54:43.668
Captain Keller,
I thought we should have a talk.

54:43.800 --> 54:46.338
Yes, I... Well, come in.

54:47.429 --> 54:51.675
Miss Sullivan, I have decided...
I have decided I'm not satisfied.

54:51.807 --> 54:54.264
- In fact, I'm deeply dissatisfied.
- Excuse me.

54:54.393 --> 54:58.143
- Is that little house near the bridge used?
- In the huntin' season.

54:58.273 --> 55:02.353
- Mrs Keller...
- If you'll give me your attention.

55:03.152 --> 55:07.778
I've made allowances because you come
from a part of the country where people...

55:07.907 --> 55:09.780
(clears throat)

55:09.909 --> 55:14.452
...women, I should say, come from,
for whom allowances must be made.

55:15.309 --> 55:17.036
I have decided nevertheless

55:17.958 --> 55:19.869
to...

55:21.670 --> 55:26.914
Miss Sullivan, I find it difficult
to talk through those glasses.

55:27.052 --> 55:31.619
Why do you wear them?
The sun's been down for an hour.

55:33.070 --> 55:35.641
Any kind of light hurts my eyes.

55:38.771 --> 55:41.097
Put them on, Miss Sullivan.

55:42.858 --> 55:44.898
I've decided...

55:46.403 --> 55:49.322
to give you another chance.

55:49.449 --> 55:51.690
- To do what?
- To remain in our employ.

55:51.827 --> 55:54.400
But on two conditions.
I'm not used to rudeness.

55:54.880 --> 55:57.159
There must be a radical
change of manner.

55:57.291 --> 55:59.960
- Whose?
- Yours, young lady! Isn't it obvious?

56:00.085 --> 56:02.954
And persuade me there's
a hope of your teaching a child

56:03.088 --> 56:06.291
who flees from you like the plague
to anyone in this house.

56:06.425 --> 56:08.297
- There isn't.
- What, Miss Annie?

56:08.427 --> 56:10.465
It's hopeless here.

56:11.449 --> 56:13.132
- Do I understand...
- If we agree it's hopeless...

56:13.264 --> 56:16.016
Miss Annie, I'm not agreed.

56:17.226 --> 56:19.559
She did fold her napkin.

56:19.646 --> 56:20.844
She learns.

56:21.398 --> 56:24.103
She learns.

56:24.233 --> 56:27.684
Do you know she began talking
when she was six months old?

56:27.820 --> 56:30.489
She could say water.

56:30.614 --> 56:32.690
Well, not really.

56:32.826 --> 56:34.864
Wah-wah.

56:36.204 --> 56:38.244
Wah-wah.

56:39.958 --> 56:44.599
But she meant water. She knew
what it meant, and only six months old.

56:44.628 --> 56:48.496
I never saw a child so bright or outgoing.

56:54.306 --> 56:57.804
It's still in there somewhere, isn't it?

57:04.775 --> 57:07.775
Miss Annie, put up with her and with us.

57:07.902 --> 57:09.942
(Captain) Us?

57:11.114 --> 57:13.619
Please.

57:13.657 --> 57:18.699
Like the lost lamb in the parable,
I love her all the more.

57:21.708 --> 57:27.295
Mrs Keller, I don't think Helen's
worst handicap is deafness or blindness.

57:27.422 --> 57:31.389
I think it's your love... and pity.

57:32.429 --> 57:35.257
All of you are so sorry for her,
you've kept her like a pet.

57:35.387 --> 57:38.259
Why, even a dog you housebreak.

57:40.768 --> 57:45.431
It's useless for me to try to teach her
language or anything else here.

57:46.150 --> 57:52.179
Miss Annie, before you came
we spoke of putting her in an asylum.

57:52.697 --> 57:54.938
What kind of asylum?

57:57.119 --> 57:59.490
For mental defectives.

58:02.599 --> 58:07.199
I visited there. I can't tell you what I saw.

58:08.255 --> 58:13.295
People like animals,
with rats in the halls and...

58:16.054 --> 58:18.213
What else are we to do if you give up?

58:20.079 --> 58:21.217
Give up?

58:22.393 --> 58:25.726
- You said it was hopeless.
- Here.

58:25.856 --> 58:30.398
Give up? Why, I only today saw
what has to be done to begin.

58:30.769 --> 58:32.983
- I want complete charge of her.
- You have that.

58:33.112 --> 58:37.063
No. I mean day and night.
She has to be dependent on me.

58:37.199 --> 58:39.322
- (Kate) For what?
- Everything.

58:39.452 --> 58:44.494
The food she eats,
the clothes she wears, fresh... air.

58:44.625 --> 58:46.996
Yes, the air she breathes.

58:47.126 --> 58:50.827
Whatever her body needs
is a primer to teach her out of.

58:50.963 --> 58:55.293
The one who lets her have it should be
her teacher, not anyone who loves her.

58:55.427 --> 59:00.052
- But if she runs from you to us...
- Yes. That's the point.

59:02.309 --> 59:06.353
I'll have to live with her somewhere else.

59:06.478 --> 59:07.807
For how long?

59:07.938 --> 59:10.726
Until she learns to listen to
and depend on me.

59:10.858 --> 59:13.184
- I've packed half my things.
- Miss Sullivan...

59:13.320 --> 59:17.170
It meets your conditions. It's the one way
I can get back in touch with Helen.

59:17.699 --> 59:20.403
And I can't be rude to you
if you're not around.

59:20.849 --> 59:23.869
What is your intention if I say no?
Pack the other half for home

59:23.996 --> 59:26.072
and abandon your charge to... to...

59:26.208 --> 59:31.034
The asylum? I grew up in such an asylum.
The state almshouse.

59:31.170 --> 59:32.286
Rats?

59:32.422 --> 59:37.329
My brother Jimmy and I used to play
with the rats because we didn't have toys.

59:37.719 --> 59:41.302
Maybe you'd like to know what Helen
will find not on visiting days.

59:41.431 --> 59:44.010
One ward was full of the old women -
crippled, blind,

59:44.684 --> 59:47.721
most of them dying,
but there was nowhere to move them.

59:47.853 --> 59:50.344
That's where they put us.

59:50.481 --> 59:54.480
There were younger ones - prostitutes
mostly, with TB and epileptic fits,

59:54.610 --> 01:00:01.112
and a couple of the kind who keep after
other girls, especially young ones.

01:00:01.242 --> 01:00:03.483
And some insane. Some just had the DT's.

01:00:03.619 --> 01:00:08.163
The youngest were in another ward
to have babies. They started at 13, 14.

01:00:08.291 --> 01:00:10.746
They'd leave,
but we played with the babies,

01:00:10.876 --> 01:00:14.791
though a lot had sores from diseases
you're not supposed to talk about.

01:00:14.922 --> 01:00:17.128
But not many of them lived.

01:00:17.259 --> 01:00:19.831
The first year we had 80. 70 died.

01:00:19.969 --> 01:00:23.469
Jimmy and I played in the dead-house
where they kept the bodies.

01:00:24.480 --> 01:00:26.802
- Oh, my dear...
- No. It made me strong.

01:00:32.023 --> 01:00:36.731
But I don't think you need send
Helen there. She's strong enough.

01:00:38.070 --> 01:00:40.110
Miss Annie.

01:00:42.409 --> 01:00:44.032
Yes?

01:00:45.286 --> 01:00:48.371
Where would you take Helen?

01:00:51.001 --> 01:00:53.589
Well...

01:00:53.670 --> 01:00:57.369
- Italy?
- What?

01:00:58.215 --> 01:01:02.463
Can't have everything.
How would your little house do?

01:01:03.972 --> 01:01:07.471
Bring Helen there after a long ride
so she won't recognise it.

01:01:07.601 --> 01:01:11.099
You can see her every day
if she doesn't know.

01:01:13.648 --> 01:01:15.226
Well?

01:01:15.358 --> 01:01:18.443
- Is that all?
- That's all.

01:01:19.199 --> 01:01:21.739
Why, Cap'n, with your permission...

01:01:24.284 --> 01:01:26.489
Percy could sleep there, run errands.

01:01:26.619 --> 01:01:28.742
We could let Percy sleep there, Cap'n.

01:01:28.871 --> 01:01:32.121
- And move in some old furniture.
- Cap'n, that old bedstead...

01:01:32.250 --> 01:01:34.623
I've not yet consented to Percy,
or the house,

01:01:34.753 --> 01:01:37.458
or the proposal,
or to Miss Sullivan staying on.

01:01:38.389 --> 01:01:39.628
When I...

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.010
Very well, I consent to everything.
For two weeks.

01:01:43.677 --> 01:01:48.635
I'll give you two weeks. It'll be a miracle
if you can get that child to tolerate you.

01:01:48.766 --> 01:01:52.634
Two weeks. Miss Annie, can you
accomplish anything in two weeks?

01:01:52.771 --> 01:01:56.050
Anything or not, two weeks
and the child comes back to us.

01:01:56.690 --> 01:02:00.226
Make up your mind, Miss Sullivan.
Yes or no?

01:02:01.320 --> 01:02:03.360
Two weeks.

01:02:05.867 --> 01:02:08.869
I'll get her to tolerate me.

01:02:15.876 --> 01:02:17.418
Hm?

01:02:17.960 --> 01:02:20.036
A. It's the first of many.

01:02:22.425 --> 01:02:24.465
26.

01:03:17.146 --> 01:03:20.182
- Does she know where she is?
- No.

01:03:20.317 --> 01:03:24.231
For all she knows
she could be in another town.

01:03:42.630 --> 01:03:45.750
- That's her sign for me.
- Yes, I know. In two weeks.

01:03:45.884 --> 01:03:49.050
Miss Annie, please be good to her.

01:03:49.179 --> 01:03:51.800
These two weeks,
try to be very good to her.

01:03:51.931 --> 01:03:53.971
I will.

01:03:54.684 --> 01:03:57.175
(grunts)

01:04:13.869 --> 01:04:16.195
No!

01:04:42.739 --> 01:04:45.130
(doll makes sound)

01:04:47.237 --> 01:04:49.277
(Helen sobs)

01:05:06.255 --> 01:05:07.880
Two weeks.

01:05:10.010 --> 01:05:12.465
What did I get into now?

01:05:19.353 --> 01:05:21.391
(Helen moaning)

01:05:31.947 --> 01:05:33.987
(Annie sobbing)

01:06:10.237 --> 01:06:13.688
Oh... oh... oh...

01:06:17.952 --> 01:06:20.407
(sobbing)

01:06:26.126 --> 01:06:28.166
(child sobbing)

01:07:00.871 --> 01:07:02.280
Jimmy!

01:07:02.414 --> 01:07:04.452
Yes?

01:07:20.806 --> 01:07:23.262
Did you call me?

01:07:27.438 --> 01:07:29.478
No.

01:07:32.860 --> 01:07:38.103
- What are you doing here?
- Taking a turn. Is everything all right?

01:07:40.869 --> 01:07:42.907
Just a dream?

01:07:45.664 --> 01:07:49.331
How old was he? The other Jimmy.

01:07:50.378 --> 01:07:52.619
Helen's age.

01:07:53.882 --> 01:07:56.373
How did he die?

01:07:56.599 --> 01:07:58.751
He had a tubercular hip.

01:07:59.762 --> 01:08:02.170
Oh, we were a pair, all right.

01:08:03.670 --> 01:08:05.841
Me blind and him on a crutch.

01:08:05.978 --> 01:08:08.016
When did he die?

01:08:10.356 --> 01:08:12.764
11 years ago, this May.

01:08:13.609 --> 01:08:15.649
You've had no one to dream about since?

01:08:15.779 --> 01:08:17.818
No, one's enough.

01:08:19.073 --> 01:08:23.229
You don't let go of things easily, do you?

01:08:23.868 --> 01:08:27.037
You'd be quite a handsome girl
if it weren't for your eyes.

01:08:27.163 --> 01:08:29.917
- No one's told you?
- Everyone.

01:08:31.086 --> 01:08:35.166
You'd be quite a gentleman
if it wasn't for your manners.

01:08:35.296 --> 01:08:39.925
You wouldn't say that to me
if you didn't have your glasses on.

01:08:42.139 --> 01:08:46.488
How will you win her hand now,
in this place?

01:08:46.725 --> 01:08:50.143
Do I know? I lost my temper
and here we are.

01:08:50.270 --> 01:08:53.890
I'm counting on her.
That little head is dying to know.

01:08:54.024 --> 01:08:56.265
- Know what?
- Anything.

01:08:56.403 --> 01:09:00.731
Any and every crumb in God's creation.
I've got to use that appetite too.

01:09:00.865 --> 01:09:03.106
- Maybe she'll teach you.
- Of course.

01:09:03.243 --> 01:09:05.448
That she isn't.

01:09:06.288 --> 01:09:11.662
That there's such a thing as dullness
of heart, acceptance, and letting go.

01:09:11.792 --> 01:09:14.462
Sooner or later we all give up, don't we?

01:09:15.368 --> 01:09:19.046
Maybe you all do.
It's my idea of the original sin.

01:09:19.176 --> 01:09:20.372
- What is?
- Giving up.

01:09:20.600 --> 01:09:22.966
You won't open her.

01:09:23.095 --> 01:09:27.923
Why can't you let her be and have
some pity on her for bein' what she is?

01:09:28.060 --> 01:09:31.760
If I'd ever once thought like that,
I'd be dead.

01:09:31.895 --> 01:09:35.845
You will be. Why trouble?

01:09:36.734 --> 01:09:38.975
Or will you teach me?

01:10:00.382 --> 01:10:02.210
No.

01:10:03.261 --> 01:10:05.800
No pity. I won't have it.

01:10:08.265 --> 01:10:11.300
On either of us.

01:10:12.119 --> 01:10:13.387
(cries out)

01:10:14.439 --> 01:10:16.680
I will touch you!

01:10:19.277 --> 01:10:21.317
But how?

01:10:21.445 --> 01:10:23.485
How do I?

01:10:25.742 --> 01:10:26.820
Percy!

01:10:26.952 --> 01:10:31.280
Percy, get up. Get out of bed
and come in here. I need you.

01:10:39.380 --> 01:10:41.292
Percy? You awake?

01:10:41.423 --> 01:10:43.251
No.

01:10:44.261 --> 01:10:48.175
How would you like to play
a nice game with Helen?

01:10:54.729 --> 01:10:56.769
Touch her hand.

01:10:57.690 --> 01:10:59.729
(makes guttural sound)

01:11:08.702 --> 01:11:10.740
Let me go! Let me go!

01:11:14.207 --> 01:11:17.078
She try and talk. She gonna hit me.

01:11:18.377 --> 01:11:20.916
She can talk, if she only knew.

01:11:21.046 --> 01:11:24.213
I'll show you how. She makes letters.

01:11:24.341 --> 01:11:27.212
This is C...

01:11:27.345 --> 01:11:30.679
C... C...

01:11:32.809 --> 01:11:37.351
She's mad at me. She won't play.
But she knows lots of letters.

01:11:37.479 --> 01:11:39.699
This is A.

01:11:40.233 --> 01:11:44.942
C... A...

01:11:47.114 --> 01:11:52.738
C... A...

01:11:54.038 --> 01:11:56.078
C...

01:12:04.381 --> 01:12:09.210
C-a-k-e.

01:12:09.345 --> 01:12:11.884
She spells cake, she gets cake.

01:12:12.015 --> 01:12:14.685
She doesn't know it means this.
Isn't that funny?

01:12:14.810 --> 01:12:19.353
She knows how to spell it,
but doesn't know she knows.

01:12:21.024 --> 01:12:25.069
All right. If she won't play it with me,
I'll play it with you.

01:12:25.194 --> 01:12:27.188
- Would you like to learn a new word?
- No.

01:12:27.322 --> 01:12:31.021
M-i-l-k.

01:12:40.340 --> 01:12:41.623
This is M...

01:12:44.130 --> 01:12:48.259
I... That's an easy one.
Just the little finger.

01:12:51.179 --> 01:12:53.219
L...

01:13:12.951 --> 01:13:18.110
Oh, why should I talk to you?
I'm teaching a new word to Percy.

01:13:33.095 --> 01:13:35.421
So you're jealous, are you?

01:13:38.018 --> 01:13:40.056
All right.

01:14:11.676 --> 01:14:14.297
Good.

01:14:14.429 --> 01:14:18.212
I'm finally back to where I can touch you.

01:14:18.350 --> 01:14:20.389
Touch and go.

01:14:20.689 --> 01:14:24.052
Well, no love lost, but here we go.

01:14:42.707 --> 01:14:46.704
You can go to bed now.
You've earned your sleep.

01:14:48.171 --> 01:14:50.211
Thank you.

01:15:35.886 --> 01:15:38.756
Now all I have to teach you is...

01:15:41.489 --> 01:15:42.637
one word.

01:15:44.936 --> 01:15:46.728
Everything.

01:16:09.210 --> 01:16:11.250
(doll makes sound)

01:16:11.837 --> 01:16:14.756
Hush, little baby, don't say a word.

01:16:14.882 --> 01:16:17.966
Mama's gonna buy you a mockingbird.

01:16:19.970 --> 01:16:26.804
If that mockingbird don't sing

01:16:28.395 --> 01:16:35.609
Mama's gonna buy you a diamond ring

01:16:37.613 --> 01:16:45.076
If that diamond ring turns brass

01:16:47.310 --> 01:16:54.126
Mama's gonna buy you a looking glass

01:16:56.382 --> 01:17:04.046
If that looking glass gets broke

01:17:05.266 --> 01:17:12.894
Mama's gonna buy you a billy goat

01:17:14.859 --> 01:17:20.695
If that billy goat...

01:18:29.225 --> 01:18:31.431
On my way to the office.
Thought I'd look in.

01:18:32.119 --> 01:18:34.395
Well, she's toleratin' me
and I'm toleratin' her.

01:18:34.720 --> 01:18:37.393
Where is... What's wrong?

01:18:37.750 --> 01:18:41.060
I think she should dress herself.
She thinks she shouldn't.

01:18:41.195 --> 01:18:43.319
- This her breakfast?
- Yes.

01:18:43.448 --> 01:18:46.365
- She wouldn't eat?
- She'd love to eat it.

01:18:46.493 --> 01:18:48.235
Why haven't you given it to her?

01:18:48.369 --> 01:18:52.034
I will, when she dresses herself.
She's thinking it over.

01:18:52.164 --> 01:18:56.244
- You intend to starve her into obeyin'?
- She won't starve, she'll learn.

01:18:56.377 --> 01:18:58.998
All's fair in love and war, Captain Keller.

01:18:59.130 --> 01:19:04.125
- This is hardly a war.
- Well, it's not love. A siege is a siege.

01:19:04.261 --> 01:19:07.215
Miss Sullivan, do you like the child?

01:19:08.390 --> 01:19:10.429
Do you?

01:19:23.738 --> 01:19:26.194
I'm beginning to.

01:19:36.208 --> 01:19:38.332
Beads.

01:19:38.461 --> 01:19:40.600
It has a name.

01:19:43.300 --> 01:19:45.707
Tree. It has a name.

01:19:50.681 --> 01:19:52.341
Tree.

01:19:53.769 --> 01:19:56.010
Bird. It has a name.

01:19:57.063 --> 01:19:58.143
Yes...

01:19:58.273 --> 01:20:00.313
No!

01:20:02.610 --> 01:20:06.654
W-a-t-e-r. Water.

01:20:12.869 --> 01:20:14.162
Oh...

01:20:15.916 --> 01:20:17.954
Oh!

01:20:34.643 --> 01:20:36.681
No!

01:20:41.315 --> 01:20:44.103
W-a-t-e-r.

01:20:45.194 --> 01:20:46.771
Water.

01:21:21.130 --> 01:21:23.019
Discipline... discipline.

01:21:25.652 --> 01:21:29.317
Disinter, disinterested...

01:21:31.115 --> 01:21:33.210
Disinterested.

01:21:33.702 --> 01:21:36.786
Where's discipline? What a dictionary.

01:21:36.912 --> 01:21:41.908
You have to know how to spell it
before you can look up how to spell it.

01:21:42.042 --> 01:21:44.082
Disinter.

01:21:45.296 --> 01:21:47.336
Disciple.

01:21:49.676 --> 01:21:51.798
Discipline.

01:21:51.927 --> 01:21:53.967
Dis-cipline.

01:21:59.060 --> 01:22:01.020
You're not to overwork your eyes,
Miss Annie.

01:22:01.688 --> 01:22:06.018
Whatever I spell to Helen,
I'd better spell right.

01:22:26.921 --> 01:22:32.841
- You've taught her so much this week.
- Not enough. Obedience isn't enough.

01:22:32.969 --> 01:22:37.048
Well... she learned two nouns
this morning. Key and water.

01:22:37.181 --> 01:22:38.724
- But not...?
- No.

01:22:38.850 --> 01:22:44.140
Not that they mean things. It's still
a finger game to her. No meaning.

01:22:44.271 --> 01:22:46.311
But she will.

01:22:49.069 --> 01:22:53.612
Might I... Might I take her
for one walk this evening?

01:22:57.661 --> 01:23:00.827
Shall we play our finger game,
Mrs Keller?

01:23:00.956 --> 01:23:03.791
- Next week seems so...
- Spell it.

01:23:03.917 --> 01:23:06.206
...so far off.
- Spell it.

01:23:06.336 --> 01:23:11.293
If she ever learns, you'll have
a lot to tell each other. Start now.

01:23:16.637 --> 01:23:21.631
In... under, under. Yes, crochet.

01:23:21.768 --> 01:23:24.390
C-r-o-s-h...

01:23:27.148 --> 01:23:29.640
C-r-o-s-h...

01:23:33.947 --> 01:23:35.985
Sewing.

01:23:38.659 --> 01:23:41.827
Oh, it has a name, and sewing isn't it.

01:23:45.125 --> 01:23:48.310
E-g-g.

01:23:51.631 --> 01:23:54.038
Egg.

01:23:54.176 --> 01:23:58.469
It has a name.
The name stands for the thing.

01:23:59.930 --> 01:24:02.172
Oh, it's so simple.

01:24:03.351 --> 01:24:05.640
Simple as birth to explain.

01:24:05.770 --> 01:24:07.894
Helen.

01:24:08.021 --> 01:24:12.234
Helen, the chick has to
come out of its shell sometime.

01:24:14.904 --> 01:24:16.896
(gasps)

01:24:21.161 --> 01:24:24.180
You come out too.

01:24:54.860 --> 01:24:57.103
Thimble.

01:25:00.239 --> 01:25:02.444
No, not key. Thimble.

01:25:03.369 --> 01:25:06.323
T-r-e-e.

01:25:06.456 --> 01:25:08.780
W-a-t...

01:25:11.293 --> 01:25:14.128
M-i-I...

01:25:14.255 --> 01:25:16.497
Good girl.

01:25:18.635 --> 01:25:20.877
D-o-l-I.

01:25:22.305 --> 01:25:24.926
M-i...

01:25:25.057 --> 01:25:27.097
(sighs)

01:25:31.729 --> 01:25:34.130
Oh...

01:25:36.278 --> 01:25:39.693
"I feel every day
more and more inadequate."

01:25:39.823 --> 01:25:44.780
"My letters must show that
I need a teacher as much as Helen."

01:25:47.497 --> 01:25:49.738
I need help too.

01:25:55.212 --> 01:25:57.751
Who?

01:25:57.881 --> 01:26:02.841
In all the world there isn't a soul
who can tell me how to reach you.

01:26:06.432 --> 01:26:08.260
How do I reach you?

01:26:09.310 --> 01:26:11.469
Doesn't she need affection too?

01:26:12.939 --> 01:26:17.103
She never shows me she needs it.
She won't have any caressing.

01:26:17.234 --> 01:26:21.314
What would another week accomplish?
We are more than satisfied.

01:26:21.448 --> 01:26:24.117
You taught her things to do, to behave.

01:26:24.242 --> 01:26:26.779
- So manageable. Cleaner.
- Cleaner?

01:26:26.912 --> 01:26:29.449
We say cleanliness is next to godliness.

01:26:30.310 --> 01:26:32.332
Cleanliness is next to nothing.

01:26:32.458 --> 01:26:35.708
- Give me more time alone with her.
- No.

01:26:37.671 --> 01:26:39.712
What is she spellin'?

01:26:41.426 --> 01:26:43.086
Water?

01:26:43.220 --> 01:26:45.792
Teaching a dog to spell?

01:26:45.930 --> 01:26:50.059
The dog doesn't know what she means
any more than she knows what you mean.

01:26:50.185 --> 01:26:52.971
I think you ask too much of her,
and yourself.

01:26:53.104 --> 01:26:57.315
God may not have meant Helen
to have the... eyes you speak of.

01:26:57.943 --> 01:27:00.778
I mean her to.

01:27:00.904 --> 01:27:03.145
What is it to you?

01:27:09.078 --> 01:27:13.029
- Half a week.
- An agreement is an agreement.

01:27:13.166 --> 01:27:15.074
Mrs Keller...

01:27:16.127 --> 01:27:18.368
I want her back.

01:27:21.257 --> 01:27:23.296
I'll send Viney to help you pack.

01:27:23.426 --> 01:27:27.423
Not until 6 o'clock.
I have her until 6 o'clock.

01:27:30.266 --> 01:27:31.926
6 o'clock.

01:27:32.060 --> 01:27:34.100
Come, Katie.

01:27:40.652 --> 01:27:43.735
Yes, what is it to me? They're satisfied.

01:27:43.863 --> 01:27:47.314
Give them back their child
and their dog, both housebroken.

01:27:47.451 --> 01:27:49.988
Everyone's satisfied but me.

01:27:51.203 --> 01:27:53.243
And you.

01:27:59.878 --> 01:28:01.421
Feel it.

01:28:01.979 --> 01:28:03.753
Reach.

01:28:03.884 --> 01:28:05.922
I wanted to teach you.

01:28:06.927 --> 01:28:08.338
Oh...

01:28:08.471 --> 01:28:14.724
Everything the earth is full of, Helen.
Everything on it that's ours for a wink.

01:28:14.853 --> 01:28:21.188
And what we are on it. The light
we bring to it and leave behind in words.

01:28:21.318 --> 01:28:26.193
You can see 5,000 years back
in the light of words.

01:28:26.323 --> 01:28:30.485
Everything we feel, think,

01:28:30.618 --> 01:28:32.944
know, and share in words.

01:28:35.310 --> 01:28:39.890
So not a soul is in darkness,
or done with even in the grave.

01:28:41.630 --> 01:28:43.668
But I know.

01:28:44.882 --> 01:28:49.296
I know one word and
I can put the world in your hand.

01:28:50.221 --> 01:28:53.804
And whatever it is to me, I won't take less.

01:28:54.935 --> 01:28:57.090
How...

01:28:57.479 --> 01:28:59.689
How do I tell you that...

01:29:01.399 --> 01:29:04.899
this... means a word?

01:29:05.028 --> 01:29:08.313
And the word means this thing, wool.

01:29:10.283 --> 01:29:12.323
Or this.

01:29:13.619 --> 01:29:19.279
S-t-o-o-I means this thing.

01:29:21.252 --> 01:29:23.659
Dress.

01:29:23.796 --> 01:29:25.920
F-a-c-e. Face.

01:29:26.048 --> 01:29:28.088
(clock striking)

01:29:38.645 --> 01:29:42.095
M-o-t-h-e-r.

01:29:43.274 --> 01:29:45.314
Mother.

01:29:46.027 --> 01:29:49.859
M-o-t-h-e-r.

01:29:49.989 --> 01:29:51.899
Mother.

01:29:52.033 --> 01:29:54.488
Let her come!

01:31:39.807 --> 01:31:41.847
(knocking)

01:31:44.270 --> 01:31:46.460
Come in.

01:31:46.730 --> 01:31:49.601
Miss Annie, your first month's salary.

01:31:49.734 --> 01:31:51.774
With many more to come, I trust.

01:31:51.903 --> 01:31:54.440
It doesn't pay our debt
for what you've done.

01:31:55.229 --> 01:31:59.318
I've taught her one thing: No.
Don't do this, don't do that.

01:31:59.453 --> 01:32:03.284
- It's more than we could do...
- I wanted to teach her what language is.

01:32:03.414 --> 01:32:06.202
I know without it
to do nothing but obey is no gift.

01:32:06.333 --> 01:32:10.319
Obedience without understanding is
a blindness. Is that all I've wished on her?

01:32:10.713 --> 01:32:12.752
- No.
- Maybe.

01:32:13.341 --> 01:32:15.712
I don't know what else to do.

01:32:15.844 --> 01:32:20.470
I simply go on and keep doing what I've
done and have faith that inside she's...

01:32:21.489 --> 01:32:24.810
that inside is waiting,
like water underground.

01:32:26.438 --> 01:32:29.225
- You can help, Captain Keller.
- How?

01:32:29.733 --> 01:32:32.270
The world is not an easy place
for anyone.

01:32:32.402 --> 01:32:34.774
I don't want her just to obey.

01:32:34.904 --> 01:32:37.940
But to let her have her way
in everything is a lie.

01:32:38.073 --> 01:32:40.113
To her.

01:32:43.412 --> 01:32:45.859
And I don't even love her.

01:32:49.293 --> 01:32:51.750
She's not my child.

01:32:56.676 --> 01:32:58.716
Well...

01:33:00.055 --> 01:33:03.091
You've got to stand between
that lie and her.

01:33:04.309 --> 01:33:06.349
Agreed.

01:33:07.938 --> 01:33:10.144
Won't you come now to supper?

01:33:13.652 --> 01:33:15.145
Yes.

01:33:18.113 --> 01:33:21.500
I used to wonder
how I could earn a living.

01:33:21.659 --> 01:33:23.900
Oh, you do.

01:33:25.372 --> 01:33:29.417
I really do. Now the question is,
can I survive it?

01:33:29.920 --> 01:33:31.701
Oh... (chuckles)

01:34:01.365 --> 01:34:04.319
Oh, the keys!

01:34:04.453 --> 01:34:07.157
Yes, I'll keep the keys.

01:34:07.288 --> 01:34:11.073
I think we've had enough
of locked doors too.

01:34:22.136 --> 01:34:24.675
Will you say the grace, Jimmy?

01:34:26.891 --> 01:34:31.269
"And Jacob was left alone and wrestled
with an angel till the breaking of the day."

01:34:31.395 --> 01:34:35.096
"And the hollow of Jacob's thigh was
out of joint as he wrestled with him."

01:34:35.233 --> 01:34:38.270
"And the angel said
'Let me go, for the day breaketh."'

01:34:38.403 --> 01:34:41.737
"And Jacob said 'I will not let thee go,
except thou bless me."'

01:34:41.864 --> 01:34:43.692
Amen.

01:34:43.824 --> 01:34:45.283
Oh, you angel.

01:34:45.409 --> 01:34:50.072
- That's a very strange grace, James.
- It's from the Good Book, isn't it?

01:34:50.207 --> 01:34:52.246
Of course it is. Didn't you know?

01:34:52.375 --> 01:34:54.747
- Yes, I knew.
- Well, why ask?

01:34:54.877 --> 01:34:57.664
It is from the Good Book
and therefore a fitting grace.

01:34:57.796 --> 01:34:59.920
Well, I don't know about that.

01:35:00.050 --> 01:35:04.961
There's a lot of things in the Good Book
that I don't care to hear just before eating.

01:35:05.096 --> 01:35:09.889
Well, fitting in the sense that Jacob's thigh
was out of joint, and so is this piggy's.

01:35:10.018 --> 01:35:12.060
- James, I declare!
- Pickles, Aunt Ev?

01:35:12.688 --> 01:35:15.439
I should say so.
You know my opinion of your pickles.

01:35:16.149 --> 01:35:20.529
This is the end of them, I'm afraid.
I didn't put up nearly enough last summer.

01:35:20.654 --> 01:35:24.402
Reverend looked in today
to complain his hens had stopped layin'.

01:35:24.829 --> 01:35:27.283
Poor fella, he was out of joint. All that...

01:35:27.411 --> 01:35:30.079
- I've always suspected those hens.
- Of what?

01:35:30.204 --> 01:35:33.039
I think they're papists. Has he tried...

01:35:33.166 --> 01:35:36.119
Now you're pulling my lower extremity.

01:35:36.252 --> 01:35:40.914
The first thing you know
we'll be having another... one of our...

01:35:46.680 --> 01:35:50.439
- Miss Annie, it's a very special day.
- It will be, when I give in to that.

01:35:50.725 --> 01:35:52.884
Please. I've hardly welcomed her home.

01:35:53.020 --> 01:35:55.600
- Captain Keller.
- Katie, we had a little talk.

01:35:55.646 --> 01:35:59.858
- Miss Annie feels if we indulge Helen...
- It's a napkin. It's not breakable.

01:35:59.984 --> 01:36:02.854
And everything she's learned is.

01:36:04.405 --> 01:36:07.158
Mrs Keller, we shouldn't
play tug of war for her.

01:36:07.283 --> 01:36:10.540
Either give her to me
or you keep her from kicking.

01:36:10.662 --> 01:36:13.448
- What do you wish to do?
- Let me take her from the table.

01:36:14.319 --> 01:36:15.239
Let her stay. She's only a child...

01:36:15.707 --> 01:36:20.340
- And ask outsiders not to interfere.
- Outsider? Why, I'm the child's aunt.

01:36:20.713 --> 01:36:24.378
Will this once hurt so much, Miss Annie?

01:36:25.399 --> 01:36:27.046
I've made all of Helen's favourite foods.

01:36:27.179 --> 01:36:30.970
It's her homecomin' party, Miss Annie.

01:36:38.314 --> 01:36:40.510
- She's testing you.
- She's testing you.

01:36:40.649 --> 01:36:43.402
Jimmy, be quiet.
Now that she's home, naturally...

01:36:43.779 --> 01:36:47.822
She wants to see what'll happen at
your hands. I said it was my main worry.

01:36:47.948 --> 01:36:51.947
- But she's not kickin' now.
- And not learning not to.

01:36:53.287 --> 01:36:55.694
She'll live up to what you demand
and no more.

01:36:55.832 --> 01:36:57.077
- She's testing you.
- Jimmy.

01:36:57.207 --> 01:36:59.913
- I have an opinion.
- No one's interested in it.

01:37:00.045 --> 01:37:03.792
I'm interested.
Of course she's testing me.

01:37:03.922 --> 01:37:07.422
Let me keep her to what she's learned
and she'll go on learning.

01:37:08.020 --> 01:37:10.755
Take her out of my hands
and it all comes apart.

01:37:14.725 --> 01:37:17.893
Be bountiful. It's at her expense.

01:37:21.106 --> 01:37:24.975
Please pass me more
of her favourite food.

01:37:35.747 --> 01:37:38.664
- Take her, Miss Annie.
- Thank you.

01:37:39.792 --> 01:37:42.539
I'm afraid you're the difficulty, Miss Annie.

01:37:42.671 --> 01:37:45.791
I'll keep her to what she's learned.
You're quite right.

01:37:45.923 --> 01:37:50.466
But I don't see we need send her
from the table. She's the guest of honour.

01:37:51.449 --> 01:37:52.801
Bring her plate back.

01:37:52.930 --> 01:37:55.302
If she were a seeing child, you wouldn't...

01:37:55.434 --> 01:38:00.011
She's not! I think
some compromise is called for.

01:38:00.145 --> 01:38:02.139
Bring her plate.

01:38:02.273 --> 01:38:04.313
Please!

01:38:09.155 --> 01:38:14.826
Occasionally another hand
can smooth things out.

01:38:14.953 --> 01:38:18.322
There. Now, shall we start all over?

01:38:23.377 --> 01:38:26.627
(James) I think we've started all over.

01:38:26.756 --> 01:38:30.006
Don't get up.
Don't smooth anything else out for me.

01:38:30.135 --> 01:38:34.460
Don't interfere in any way. I treat her like
a seeing child because I ask her to see.

01:38:34.722 --> 01:38:37.676
I expect her to see! Don't undo what I do!

01:38:37.809 --> 01:38:40.097
- Where are you going?
- To fill this pitcher.

01:38:40.229 --> 01:38:43.119
You let her speak to you like that?
A creature who works for you?

01:38:43.689 --> 01:38:46.262
No, I don't.

01:38:46.400 --> 01:38:47.859
- Let her go.
- What?

01:38:47.985 --> 01:38:50.440
I said let her go! She's right.

01:38:51.220 --> 01:38:52.113
She's right.

01:38:52.239 --> 01:38:54.814
Kate's right, I'm right, and you're wrong.

01:38:54.951 --> 01:38:57.621
Has it never occurred to you
that on one occasion

01:38:57.746 --> 01:39:00.615
you might be consummately wrong?

01:39:07.713 --> 01:39:09.956
All right. Pump.

01:39:11.009 --> 01:39:13.333
No, she's not here. Pump.

01:39:18.225 --> 01:39:20.630
W-a-t-e-r. Water.

01:39:20.644 --> 01:39:23.015
It has a name. W-a-t...

01:39:47.127 --> 01:39:51.755
Wah... wah.

01:39:54.970 --> 01:39:59.097
Wah... wah.

01:40:22.956 --> 01:40:24.996
Yes.

01:40:29.796 --> 01:40:31.255
Yes.

01:40:45.228 --> 01:40:47.101
Yes.

01:40:47.229 --> 01:40:49.270
Oh, my dear.

01:40:56.698 --> 01:40:58.738
Ground.

01:41:03.747 --> 01:41:05.786
Yes!

01:41:10.949 --> 01:41:13.350
Pump.

01:41:15.800 --> 01:41:17.425
Yes.

01:41:21.972 --> 01:41:24.012
Tree.

01:41:28.313 --> 01:41:30.020
Step.

01:41:30.148 --> 01:41:32.188
Mrs Keller. Mrs Keller!

01:41:34.027 --> 01:41:35.402
Bell.

01:41:35.779 --> 01:41:36.904
Mrs Keller!

01:41:37.029 --> 01:41:39.438
Mrs Keller... Mrs Keller.

01:41:42.828 --> 01:41:45.199
Mother. Papa.

01:41:45.329 --> 01:41:47.369
She knows!

01:42:19.155 --> 01:42:21.194
Teacher.

01:42:35.755 --> 01:42:37.795
Teacher.

01:43:17.713 --> 01:43:19.421
Teacher.

01:45:11.203 --> 01:45:15.449
I... love...

01:45:20.420 --> 01:45:22.458
Helen.
