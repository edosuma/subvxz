(INDISTINCT CHATTERING)

00:59.852 --> 01:01.936
So how long
were you gonna keep me waiting?

01:02.020 --> 01:03.312
Excuse me?

01:03.397 --> 01:05.480
-I'm dying over there.
-Where?

01:05.566 --> 01:09.485
There, by the Ben Franklin
potato salad pavilion.

01:10.571 --> 01:12.280
I'm sorry.
Are we supposed to know each other?

01:12.364 --> 01:16.242
Definitely. I mean, we're supposed to.
We don't, but we should.

01:18.036 --> 01:21.748
-Ray. Ray Koval.
-(CLEARS THROAT) Theresa Corrado.

01:21.832 --> 01:23.750
-Nice to meet you.
-Okay.

01:23.834 --> 01:26.335
-Happy Independence Day.
-And to you.

01:31.341 --> 01:34.927
Look, I'm sorry. I don't know if it's the knee
or something, but I'm a little confused.

01:35.012 --> 01:37.513
I thought we were checking each other out.

01:37.598 --> 01:40.975
No. Sorry. Maybe you're drunk.

01:41.059 --> 01:43.811
No, no, no.
If I was drunk, I'd be coming on to you.

01:43.896 --> 01:44.937
That's a relief.

01:45.022 --> 01:48.107
If I was drunk,
I'd be saying how amazing you look

01:48.192 --> 01:50.735
and how crazy it is
that you're standing here on your own.

01:50.819 --> 01:53.988
Wow. Are you always like this?

01:54.072 --> 01:58.117
No. I sometimes sound like this,
but this is definitely different.

01:59.077 --> 02:01.579
-What's so different?
-I don't know.

02:03.081 --> 02:06.000
I guess that's what I came over to find out.

05:57.107 --> 06:00.026
RAY OVER PHONE: You're kidding, right?
DALE: I'm dead serious.

06:00.110 --> 06:03.446
RAY: Behind me?
DALE: He made the turn with us on 6th.

06:03.530 --> 06:06.323
RAY: Hey, if this is some kind of game
you guys play to keep things exciting,

06:06.408 --> 06:08.159
I gotta teII you, it's a IittIe sad.

06:08.243 --> 06:10.911
DALE: (CHUCKLES) This is no game, Ray.
This is real.

06:10.996 --> 06:13.247
Like I toId you, man,
this is oId-schooI espionage.

06:13.331 --> 06:15.958
Moscow rules. Street spies.

06:16.043 --> 06:17.835
RAY: How far behind me?

06:17.919 --> 06:20.796
DALE: He's about three meters back.
He must have picked us up downtown.

06:20.881 --> 06:22.339
RAY: And you know this guy?

06:22.424 --> 06:25.801
DALE: l've seen him around.
He's definiteIy Burkett & RandIe.

06:25.886 --> 06:30.431
I keep teIIing you, man. These peopIe
take soap and shaving cream very seriousIy.

06:30.515 --> 06:33.100
So I guess that means we're going to plan B.

06:33.185 --> 06:34.560
DALE: Let's do it.

06:34.644 --> 06:37.855
-What's he wearing?
-Navy turtIeneck, gray jacket.

06:38.273 --> 06:39.482
(HORNS HONKING)

06:45.489 --> 06:48.407
That was sweet, man.
It's all good. It's all good.

06:48.492 --> 06:50.910
There's no way this guy is working solo,
so if we want to bust you out,

06:50.994 --> 06:54.371
we're gonna have to make a little noise
up here at the corner.

06:54.456 --> 06:55.873
(SPEAKING RUSSIAN)

06:58.376 --> 07:01.003
DALE: You wanna box him out of here
or Ieapfrog? What do you wanna do?

07:01.088 --> 07:03.089
RAY: I still think you're messing with me.

07:03.173 --> 07:05.424
Call it, Ray. Box or leapfrog?

07:05.884 --> 07:08.928
Or maybe you just want to find out
if I'm worth the money.

07:09.012 --> 07:12.014
-DALE: Come on, man.
-Leapfrog.

07:12.599 --> 07:13.849
(SPEAKING RUSSIAN)

07:16.186 --> 07:17.228
(WOMAN GROANS)

07:17.562 --> 07:18.729
Jesus!

07:20.774 --> 07:23.400
Watch where you go. It's New York, okay?

07:23.527 --> 07:25.027
Let me help.

07:26.071 --> 07:27.571
Open the eyes!

08:52.782 --> 08:55.326
-Hey, you there?
-DALE: What are you doing?

08:55.827 --> 08:56.869
Problem.

08:58.705 --> 09:02.708
-DALE: I thought you were in position.
-I am. I was.

09:02.792 --> 09:04.293
DALE: We're two minutes away.

09:04.377 --> 09:06.879
-We're blown.
-What are you taIking about?

09:06.963 --> 09:08.088
Reschedule the meet.

09:08.173 --> 09:10.174
No. No can do.

09:10.884 --> 09:12.509
We're blown. Just walk away.

09:12.636 --> 09:16.013
Listen to me. I know what it's like.
New guy on the team, big game,

09:16.139 --> 09:18.474
you wanna make a good impression.

09:20.310 --> 09:21.644
Hello? Ray?

10:36.553 --> 10:37.928
Remember me?

10:41.725 --> 10:44.435
-Sure. Of course. We...
-Long time, huh?

10:45.478 --> 10:47.730
-Yes!
-Gotcha.

10:49.774 --> 10:52.318
-I'm sorry, I just...
-Just what?

10:52.402 --> 10:53.444
I'm drawing a blank.

10:53.570 --> 10:55.195
-Nice try.
-Excuse me?

10:55.280 --> 10:58.198
A little professional courtesy
would make this a lot less awkward.

10:58.283 --> 11:00.951
-How do I know you?
-How do you know me?

11:01.911 --> 11:05.581
(LAUGHING) Wow! That's tough.
That's a strong play.

11:06.291 --> 11:09.543
Believe me, I've spent a lot of time thinking
what this would be like,

11:09.627 --> 11:11.962
where we'd be, what I'd say, what you'd say.

11:12.088 --> 11:14.214
-But I never thought that you'd...
-I'm terribly sorry.

11:14.299 --> 11:15.758
You really want to go this way?

11:15.842 --> 11:17.468
You clearly have me confused
with someone else.

11:17.594 --> 11:18.677
I don't know.

11:18.762 --> 11:21.305
I mean, I'm not great on names.
I should be. I try.

11:21.431 --> 11:24.183
Faces, I'm definitely better.
Faces, I'm like a B, B minus.

11:24.267 --> 11:27.436
Where I'm good, where I really excel,
people I've slept with.

11:27.520 --> 11:30.189
That's been a traditional area of strength
for me.

11:30.273 --> 11:33.317
Look, seriously,
I don't know who you think I am, but...

11:33.443 --> 11:34.985
You charm me, you seduce me,
you screw me,

11:35.111 --> 11:37.529
then you drug me
and ransack my hotel room.

11:37.614 --> 11:40.866
And how sick is this? You know, the last
thing I remember before I passed out

11:40.950 --> 11:42.951
was how much I liked you.

11:43.453 --> 11:46.413
All right. You don't look crazy,

11:46.498 --> 11:48.248
which is the only reason
why I'm not screaming

11:48.333 --> 11:52.628
-for a security guard right now, but...
-I can't believe you're going this way.

11:52.712 --> 11:56.632
(LAUGHS) Wait. Is this a joke?
Is that what it is?

11:56.883 --> 11:59.551
Do you have any idea how far my ass
was hanging out because of you?

11:59.636 --> 12:01.387
Did I win something?

12:02.889 --> 12:05.057
I woke up the next morning,
I went back to the consul.

12:05.141 --> 12:07.810
I practically crawled over glass
to get a copy of the guest list.

12:07.894 --> 12:09.645
I spent the next 24 hours trying to figure out

12:09.771 --> 12:13.565
if you were working for Mossad,
the Syrians or the Russians.

12:13.650 --> 12:16.652
-And which was it?
-Still working for the CIA?

12:17.487 --> 12:19.655
Okay, I think we're done now.

12:20.115 --> 12:23.909
American Consulate, Dubai,
you and me, Fourth of July, 2003.

12:23.993 --> 12:25.119
Find someone else to bother.

12:25.203 --> 12:27.371
-Red, white and blue margaritas.
-Stay away from me.

12:27.497 --> 12:30.749
I had a knee brace, you had toe rings.
First toe ring I ever saw, by the way.

12:30.834 --> 12:32.084
You follow me, I'll scream.

12:32.168 --> 12:35.170
I took vacation time to find you! Five years.

12:35.296 --> 12:36.630
And every time I walked into an evaluation...

12:36.714 --> 12:38.590
-I'm warning you for the last time.
-...I was waiting for them

12:38.675 --> 12:39.883
to throw your picture on the screen and say,

12:40.009 --> 12:42.010
"So, Ray, anything you care to tell us
about Dubai?"

12:42.137 --> 12:45.180
-You are harassing me!
-So who the hell are you?

12:48.184 --> 12:51.228
Oh, no. You?

12:54.899 --> 12:55.941
(EXHALES DEEPLY)

12:56.025 --> 12:59.027
-You're the drop.
-You're my contact?

13:03.741 --> 13:05.868
CLAIRE: You're acting like
I owe you an apology.

13:05.994 --> 13:07.411
Knock yourself out.

13:07.537 --> 13:10.164
You were an assignment. You're a big boy.
You knew what you were doing.

13:10.248 --> 13:11.790
I can see it's really been eating at you.

13:11.875 --> 13:15.836
An MI6 case officer takes a strange girl
from an embassy party

13:15.920 --> 13:18.672
back to his hotel room
where he has an unsecured briefcase

13:18.756 --> 13:21.258
-full of Egyptian Air Defense codes.
-Did they tell you to sleep with me?

13:21.384 --> 13:24.094
I needed the codes. I thought the less time
I spent with you, the better.

13:24.220 --> 13:26.972
-Oh, Jesus.
-How did you get on this project?

13:27.056 --> 13:29.391
-And you're the mole.
-And who the hell hired you anyway?

13:29.517 --> 13:31.268
-I can't believe it.
-How did you get this job?

13:31.394 --> 13:33.187
I got news for you, okay? The day I left MI6,

13:33.271 --> 13:35.856
I had 1 5 major companies
begging for my services.

13:35.940 --> 13:38.233
Well, I guess you picked wrong.
But you must be used to that.

13:38.359 --> 13:41.778
-You know, I've got a meeting in 1 2 minutes.
-Where's the drop? Hand it over.

13:41.905 --> 13:45.157
-Forget it. I'm not working with you.
-Excuse me?

13:45.241 --> 13:47.910
You think I'm gonna let you
be my contact officer?

13:48.036 --> 13:50.454
-This is way over your head.
-Over my head?

13:50.580 --> 13:52.831
Lady, I worked Yemen, Athens and Cairo.

13:52.916 --> 13:55.292
I've been promoted and decorated
every place I served.

13:55.418 --> 13:56.835
Tell Duke to send someone else.

13:56.920 --> 13:59.296
Listen. I'm sure you know your way
around a shoe store,

13:59.422 --> 14:00.964
but I did 1 2 years in the field.

14:01.090 --> 14:02.799
And how long have you been working
for Equikrom?

14:02.926 --> 14:04.760
-Long enough.
-How long?

14:06.429 --> 14:07.888
Three weeks.

14:09.432 --> 14:12.935
Three whole weeks? Like every day?

14:14.145 --> 14:17.189
Well, I've spent the last 1 4 months
undercover inside Burkett & Randle.

14:17.273 --> 14:21.109
I'm an Assistant Director
of Counterintelligence. I am all the way in.

14:21.236 --> 14:24.863
So let's get this straight.
I'm the asset here. You're a delivery boy.

14:24.948 --> 14:26.949
And the only thing I'm gonna give you
is a message.

14:27.075 --> 14:30.077
Tell Duke I don't ever wanna see you again.

14:30.787 --> 14:34.206
I run field agents for a living.
There's only two ways to do it.

14:34.290 --> 14:35.332
Either you bring them flowers

14:35.458 --> 14:37.501
or you hang them by their heels
out of the window.

14:37.627 --> 14:40.879
Now, maybe you're so used to having
your legs in the air you don't realize it,

14:40.964 --> 14:43.549
but you're upside down, sister.

14:43.633 --> 14:44.883
I own you.

14:44.968 --> 14:50.097
-You've 1 0 seconds to get your hand off me.
-Or what? You won't be my friend anymore?

14:50.515 --> 14:54.101
I like this gig.
I like the money. I like the hours.

14:54.185 --> 14:56.478
So I'm not going anywhere,
and you're gonna get over it

14:56.604 --> 14:59.273
because if you ever mention again
that you don't wanna work with me

14:59.357 --> 15:02.901
or that we've met before or that you think
someone else might do a better job,

15:02.986 --> 15:05.696
if I get replaced for any reason at all,

15:05.822 --> 15:08.031
I'm gonna call those suckers
over at Burkett & Randle

15:08.157 --> 15:12.703
and tell them they have an Equikrom spy
in the heart of their security team.

15:14.205 --> 15:18.375
Be a shame to let the last 1 4 months
go down the drain, wouldn't it?

15:21.879 --> 15:23.839
So where's my package?

15:30.513 --> 15:33.265
Tell Duke this is the one
he's been waiting for.

15:33.349 --> 15:37.894
-You screw this up, I'll ruin your life.
-I thought you tried that already.

15:42.859 --> 15:45.902
RAY: You wanna take one last shot
at that apology?

16:11.554 --> 16:13.096
Okay. Thank you.

16:33.451 --> 16:36.578
What'd she say exactly?
I mean, her exact words.

16:36.913 --> 16:40.707
She said, "Tell Duke
this is the one he's been waiting for."

16:45.254 --> 16:47.589
-PAM: Do you wanna do it?
-Go ahead.

16:49.759 --> 16:52.761
DUKE: Easy. Just...
Just, you know, pull it out.

16:53.096 --> 16:54.680
-Slowly. Slowly, slowly.
-Duke.

16:54.764 --> 16:56.556
All right, go ahead.

17:02.230 --> 17:05.232
Pam, Pam, easy, don't tear it.
Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam, just... Careful.

17:05.316 --> 17:06.942
-For Christ's sake, Duke, keep your shirt on.
-Just...

17:07.026 --> 17:10.278
Do something useful.
Punch up Tully's fingerprints.

17:11.114 --> 17:13.281
Wow. Look at this.

17:14.242 --> 17:16.117
So is this the big one?

17:19.122 --> 17:21.915
-I gotta call Garsik right away.
-PAM: Yeah.

17:22.791 --> 17:25.627
DUKE: Come on.
I need a secure line at Equikrom.

17:45.606 --> 17:47.941
-How are you?
-Good. How are you?

18:02.915 --> 18:04.833
CLAlRE: Houston.
This was over the weekend.

18:04.917 --> 18:06.001
NED: Who are they?

18:06.085 --> 18:10.839
Researchers at the fragrance lab down there,
when they're not dealing ecstasy.

18:11.424 --> 18:12.674
Track it.

18:15.678 --> 18:18.430
West Coast Market Coordinator
of the Floor Wax Division.

18:18.514 --> 18:22.100
Came back from lunch on Friday,
handed in his resignation.

18:22.185 --> 18:23.935
-Unexpected?
-Very.

18:24.020 --> 18:26.605
Three kids in private school,
he just remortgaged his house,

18:26.689 --> 18:28.607
-and the wife has a heart condition.
-All right.

18:28.691 --> 18:33.028
Well, get his financials, phone, e-mail,
and get the wife's prognosis.

18:34.864 --> 18:37.616
CLAIRE: Senior V.P., Medical Disposables.
He called in Sunday,

18:37.700 --> 18:40.285
lost his laptop in the Denver Airport.

18:40.369 --> 18:41.870
Why does this guy look familiar?

18:41.996 --> 18:45.832
He had a briefcase
full of sales projections stolen last year.

18:46.209 --> 18:49.336
-Is this the guy who bought the boat?
-Same guy.

18:49.879 --> 18:53.632
-All right. Get a team up his ass tonight.
-I sent them this morning.

18:53.716 --> 18:54.883
(PHONE RINGING)

18:55.843 --> 18:57.552
We're in a meeting.

18:58.805 --> 19:01.389
Now? Everyone?

19:03.559 --> 19:05.477
Well, did they say why?

19:09.732 --> 19:12.567
It's Tully. Mr. Tully's coming down.

19:12.652 --> 19:15.904
He wants the entire floor gathered
in five minutes.

19:50.731 --> 19:53.692
AIDE: Dick, it's just that you have
a very busy scheduIe today.

19:53.776 --> 19:55.110
RICHARD: Yeah, well, something's come up.

19:55.194 --> 19:58.363
AIDE: There's the dandruff shampoo
marketing presentation at 3:00.

19:58.447 --> 20:00.866
-Cancel.
-They're in the building.

20:00.950 --> 20:01.950
Make it tomorrow.

20:02.076 --> 20:05.370
The nail polish R&D group from Germany
is at 3:45.

20:05.454 --> 20:06.538
Reschedule.

20:06.622 --> 20:08.540
You've got a premium diaper teleconference

20:08.624 --> 20:10.208
-at 4: 1 5.
-Tape it.

20:10.293 --> 20:12.794
The nasal decongestant
rebranding numbers are in.

20:12.879 --> 20:15.046
-They wanted 1 5 minutes at around...
-Cancel!

20:15.131 --> 20:18.967
And the toothpaste. And the car wax dinner.
Cancel it all.

20:24.432 --> 20:26.933
RICHARD: All right, let's have a look at me.

20:32.106 --> 20:33.565
There should be another vehicle.

20:33.649 --> 20:35.567
Yeah. Change of plans.
You're going with them.

20:35.651 --> 20:39.821
Everybody's going. Let's go, come on.
Get out there and sell it, folks!

20:39.947 --> 20:42.949
Go, go, go! Come on!
Get the hell out of here!

20:48.748 --> 20:49.915
(TIRES SCREECHING)

20:50.458 --> 20:53.627
Get out! Leave it running.
Leave it running. I'm driving.

21:06.015 --> 21:07.265
DALE: This is starting to look pretty good.

21:07.350 --> 21:09.768
DUKE: I can't even tell them apart.
Which one is the new one?

21:09.852 --> 21:11.186
Right here.

21:12.021 --> 21:14.189
-This is 1 6.
-That's a match.

21:17.026 --> 21:18.693
Boris, handwriting?

21:20.196 --> 21:23.031
Hundred percent. It's Howard Tully.

21:23.157 --> 21:26.117
DUKE: All right.
Burkett & Randle, here we come!

21:26.202 --> 21:27.285
Guys?

21:30.122 --> 21:33.291
RICHARD: Duke? I'm locked out. Again.

21:35.002 --> 21:37.420
Yeah, I'm standing right outside.

21:38.214 --> 21:41.841
Of course it's me!
Who the hell else has this number?

21:41.926 --> 21:45.345
Yeah, okay. Duke, you know,
for all the money that I'm spending on this,

21:45.429 --> 21:48.181
you could've given me a code
that I can remember.

21:48.265 --> 21:49.307
Sir!

21:59.318 --> 22:01.194
What the hell is this?

22:09.328 --> 22:10.912
Why are we here?

22:12.540 --> 22:15.709
We are here today
because the ruIes have changed.

22:16.585 --> 22:21.840
We're here because the fabric of integrity
has been so abused and mangIed

22:21.924 --> 22:25.051
that it is little more
than a threadbare memory.

22:26.929 --> 22:30.265
We're here because it's no Ionger enough
to have the best ideas,

22:30.349 --> 22:35.228
or the best manufacturing,
or the best pipeIine to deIiver your product.

22:36.397 --> 22:40.775
"We're here today because we find ourselves
in a world where duplicity and theft

22:40.901 --> 22:45.572
"are tested daily as replacements
for innovation and perseverance."

22:45.948 --> 22:47.240
(LAUGHING)

22:48.576 --> 22:50.785
"Tested daily." What a bunch of crap.
Can you believe this?

22:50.911 --> 22:55.290
This from a guy who bought a dump
so he could go through our garbage.

22:55.416 --> 22:57.792
I beIieve the history
of all successful endeavors

22:57.877 --> 23:02.422
can be reduced to a series
of decisive moments.

23:03.132 --> 23:05.050
"There are moments in the history
of all things

23:05.134 --> 23:07.635
"where the placement of a single..."

23:07.762 --> 23:11.056
...where the pIacement of a singIe moIecuIe
can make the difference

23:11.140 --> 23:13.641
between triumph and catastrophe.

23:13.768 --> 23:16.144
I mean, who the hell writes
with a fountain pen anymore?

23:16.228 --> 23:19.064
For Christ's sake.
How fricking pretentious is that?

23:19.148 --> 23:21.816
This room we're in now,
this entire program,

23:21.942 --> 23:25.737
was created in anticipation
ofjust such a moment.

23:25.821 --> 23:29.157
You peopIe are the very best at what you do.

23:30.367 --> 23:35.622
You were chosen by that standard.
You've been paid and treated accordingIy.

23:36.874 --> 23:42.170
And you have never been tested
as you are about to be tested.

23:43.297 --> 23:46.508
"Burkett & Randle will be rolling out
a new product

23:48.135 --> 23:51.513
"in the very near future."

23:51.680 --> 23:55.141
And while l cannot reveal
the nature of this product,

23:55.226 --> 23:59.562
beIieve me when I teII you that simpIy
by announcing its deveIopment...

24:00.231 --> 24:05.860
"...B&R will be dramatically repositioned
at the summit of the global marketplace."

24:06.821 --> 24:09.239
I don't need to expIain to anybody
in this room

24:09.365 --> 24:12.909
why the scope, the detaiIs,
the very existence of this project

24:13.035 --> 24:15.328
must be so carefuIIy protected.

24:15.871 --> 24:18.748
I expect your best in days to come,

24:19.250 --> 24:23.711
and I promise you,
if we stay focused and vigiIant,

24:24.338 --> 24:26.089
we will, all of us...

24:27.383 --> 24:28.842
"...prosper."

24:33.180 --> 24:35.807
What the hell does he have over there?

24:35.891 --> 24:38.726
Dick? Dick? Don't go dark on me now.

24:40.187 --> 24:41.229
Dick!

24:43.232 --> 24:46.609
We gotta stay positive. Hey, look around.

24:47.278 --> 24:48.361
This is why we're here.

24:48.445 --> 24:52.073
When you came to me,
that first conversation, this is it.

24:52.199 --> 24:54.576
This is why we built the unit.

24:54.702 --> 24:57.871
-I know what he's doing.
-Dick. Dick!

24:58.622 --> 25:00.999
Look at me.
This is a great team we've got here.

25:01.083 --> 25:02.167
RICHARD: Mmm-hmm.

25:02.251 --> 25:05.295
Yeah. We are so prepped.
We are so ready to deploy.

25:05.421 --> 25:08.464
You say the word,
you unleash the beast, Dick.

25:08.591 --> 25:11.968
-We will tear this thing apart.
-He's just timing the blow, Duke.

25:12.094 --> 25:17.056
-No. Wrong. We caught a break here.
-We caught a break? You call this a break?

25:17.933 --> 25:20.852
I got a shareholders' convention
in nine days.

25:20.936 --> 25:22.145
Hey, man, he's not thinking about that.

25:22.271 --> 25:23.521
Oh!

25:23.606 --> 25:27.775
Are you out of your fricking mind?
That is all that he thinks about.

25:29.320 --> 25:32.322
And believe you me, if he has got a knife,
that is when he's gonna use it,

25:32.448 --> 25:35.325
because that's what I'd do! Yeah.

25:35.451 --> 25:39.454
No, I would wait till he is right in the middle
of a big old standing ovation.

25:39.580 --> 25:44.542
I would wait till he is just so overwhelmed
with beloved waves of adoration,

25:44.627 --> 25:47.170
he couldn't even hear the sound
of his own cojones

25:47.296 --> 25:49.464
as they hit the goddamn floor!

25:53.802 --> 25:55.136
(EXHALES DEEPLY)

25:59.308 --> 26:01.809
Oh, my God, he is gonna crush me.

26:03.979 --> 26:06.105
Tell your people not to make vacation plans.

26:06.190 --> 26:08.399
-They're gonna wanna know why.
-Then they're in the wrong business.

26:08.484 --> 26:10.944
How are we supposed to work it up
if we don't know what we're protecting?

26:11.028 --> 26:13.988
Look, I don't know. Assume it's everything.

26:16.784 --> 26:19.953
B&R's mainframe network is a beast.

26:20.037 --> 26:23.539
I mean, we've spent
the last 1 0 months probing.

26:23.666 --> 26:24.832
We got nowhere.

26:24.959 --> 26:26.876
I mean, the encryption
and system awareness codes

26:27.002 --> 26:30.797
are tactically equivalent
to anything we had at the Pentagon.

26:31.882 --> 26:37.053
The good news is 200 photocopiers
that B&R purchased last month.

26:37.388 --> 26:39.180
We paid a little visit down to the vendor,

26:39.306 --> 26:43.393
and we made a few adjustments
to one of the units before it shipped.

26:44.687 --> 26:46.437
Call this the Ghost.

26:46.522 --> 26:49.440
It's not fast, it's not easy,
but this device right here

26:49.525 --> 26:51.526
allows us to hijack signal traffic

26:51.652 --> 26:54.654
without leaving
any electronic residue behind.

26:55.030 --> 27:01.035
Here. Right now we're hacking a photocopier
in their Human Resources Department.

27:01.495 --> 27:06.040
I mean, we're still mapping, but look,
we're tapped into 1 2 units already.

27:06.375 --> 27:08.876
PAM: The B&R Research
and Development Unit in Westchester

27:09.003 --> 27:12.547
hasn't brought a major new product
to market since 1 997.

27:13.048 --> 27:16.092
In spite of that,
we made it a surveillance priority.

27:16.218 --> 27:18.428
Number one, we graph the volume of traffic

27:18.554 --> 27:20.930
and the quality of vehicles
in that parking lot.

27:21.056 --> 27:24.058
Number two, we track the stock portfolios
and mortgage payments

27:24.184 --> 27:25.393
of everybody on site.

27:25.519 --> 27:28.438
And, number three, we monitor
the frequency of Internet shopping

27:28.564 --> 27:30.481
and pornography searches
from inside that lab.

27:30.566 --> 27:34.986
Stocks are down, porn is up
and there's plenty of free parking.

27:35.070 --> 27:37.113
There's nothing going on here.

27:37.239 --> 27:39.782
We're confident
that whatever this new product is,

27:39.908 --> 27:41.701
it comes from outside the company.

27:41.785 --> 27:43.161
The moment this meeting breaks up,

27:43.245 --> 27:47.040
we'll be going over every acquisition
B&R has made in the past 1 8 months.

27:47.124 --> 27:48.583
We'll find it.

27:48.709 --> 27:52.086
FETYOV: This B&R building is very strong
with security.

27:52.921 --> 27:55.631
Is the same for us like the computer.

27:55.758 --> 27:57.967
We are all the time feeling our way
around this building,

27:58.093 --> 28:00.094
but not getting anywhere.

28:00.721 --> 28:04.599
Then we make a big discovery.
Travel Department is not in the big building.

28:04.725 --> 28:10.146
Travel Department is four blocks away
and this building is very different.

28:10.731 --> 28:14.734
-(CHUCKLES) Very simple and very basic.
-Yeah, it's a gold mine, Dick.

28:14.818 --> 28:16.819
They basically handle
all of B&R's commercial travel,

28:16.945 --> 28:21.866
so every private jet, car, boat, hotel,
housing, everything goes through them.

28:21.950 --> 28:25.995
The boys have got some great ideas
on how to get us on the inside.

28:26.663 --> 28:29.290
Very simple and very basic.

29:12.501 --> 29:14.127
(BELL TOLLING AT A DISTANCE)

29:32.521 --> 29:34.730
I swear, she was that big.

-You're always kidding.
-I'm not. I'm a very serious guy.

Hi. Remember me?

31:39.147 --> 31:41.274
-Yes, I...
-Gotcha.

31:42.818 --> 31:45.194
-I'm sorry, I just...
-Just what?

31:45.988 --> 31:47.989
-I'm drawing a blank.
-Don't even try it.

31:48.115 --> 31:49.699
-Excuse me?
-Can I make a suggestion?

31:49.825 --> 31:52.410
A little professional courtesy
would make this a lot less awkward.

31:52.494 --> 31:56.038
-How do I know you?
-How do you know me?

31:56.164 --> 31:58.624
Wow. That's a strong play.

31:58.709 --> 32:00.710
Believe me, I've spent a lot of time
thinking what this would be like,

32:00.836 --> 32:03.337
where we'd be, what I'd say, what you'd say,

32:03.463 --> 32:05.006
-but I never thought that you'd...
-I'm sorry. I just...

32:05.132 --> 32:06.173
You really wanna go this way?

32:06.300 --> 32:08.217
Look, you clearly have me confused
with someone else.

32:08.343 --> 32:10.261
I don't know, I'm not great on names.
I should be. I try.

32:10.345 --> 32:12.597

That's been a traditional
area of strength for me.

32:17.352 --> 32:19.312
Look, I don't know who you think I am, but...

32:19.396 --> 32:22.189
You talk me up, seduce me, screw me,

32:22.649 --> 32:25.401
then you drug me and ransack
my hotel room.

32:25.527 --> 32:27.653
And how sick is this? The last thing
I remember before I passed out

32:27.738 --> 32:28.821
was how much I liked you.

32:28.905 --> 32:30.740
(LAUGHS) I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I can't...

-I... No, I...

No, it's not. I'm sorry. It's just...

32:35.829 --> 32:38.039
It's... Seduce you? You?

-You admit it?
-I...

-No, you're right. You're right.

It's not funny. Seriously. Completely.

-And it's not you. It's not you.
-What the hell does that mean?

It's tension. Nerves.
Nervous laughter, obviously.

33:03.690 --> 33:07.818
Yeah, with that brace and everything,
you really looked like you were hurting.

33:07.903 --> 33:08.986
My knee is fine. Thanks.

was hanging out because of you?

-Mmm. I can imagine.
-That's all you say?

33:14.618 --> 33:16.786
And I'm sorry.

33:16.912 --> 33:17.912
I can tell.

33:18.038 --> 33:22.875
It's... I don't know. The laughter.
I don't know what that's about. It's about...

33:23.460 --> 33:27.296
Nerves. Guilt. Lots of guilt. And regret.

Oh, Jesus! This can't be happening.
This is not the day to not get a wake-up call.

I can't believe I didn't get my wake-up call.

36:41.283 --> 36:44.326
No. I couldn't. It's classified.

36:44.911 --> 36:47.955
Yeah, I was supposed to be in Cairo
two days ago.

36:48.081 --> 36:51.000
-You told me London.
-The point is, I blew it off.

36:51.126 --> 36:52.918
And nobody called this morning?

36:53.003 --> 36:55.588
-You were here.
-I'm a heavy sleeper.

36:55.672 --> 36:58.340
RAY: So what are you saying?
I took the call and didn't tell you?

36:58.466 --> 37:00.301
When did you set this up, anyway?

37:00.427 --> 37:01.969
CLAIRE: Last night.
RAY: Where was I?

37:02.095 --> 37:03.596
In the bath.

37:03.680 --> 37:06.891
-We were in there together.
-When I went for the ice.

37:06.975 --> 37:08.309
RAY: While I was waiting?

37:08.435 --> 37:10.060
CLAIRE: I can't believe they didn't call.

37:10.145 --> 37:12.646
You snuck out of the tub
to leave a wake-up call!

37:12.772 --> 37:15.816
CLAIRE: This is a five-star hotel.
How does that happen?

37:17.444 --> 37:19.278
Welcome to Italy.

37:20.864 --> 37:26.160
Look, I told you it was classified.
I shouldn't have to explain this to you.

37:26.286 --> 37:29.079
Well, this beats the hell out of Dubai.

37:29.164 --> 37:31.624
-What?
-I'm still standing, right?

37:32.792 --> 37:35.044
There. See? There it is.

37:35.170 --> 37:36.795
If you're looking
for Egyptian Air Defense codes,

37:36.880 --> 37:39.214
-I'm keeping them in my socks these days.
-See, I knew it.

37:39.341 --> 37:41.133
You'll never get over that, will you?
You couldn't.

37:41.217 --> 37:43.010
I'm afraid that's classified.

37:43.136 --> 37:46.013
-You actually think, what, I'm playing you?
-That's crazy, right?

37:46.139 --> 37:48.557
This felt like an assignment to you?
Three days? All this?

37:48.683 --> 37:50.809
What was the objective? Rug burn?

37:50.894 --> 37:54.355
Who knows, maybe you didn't want me
in Cairo yesterday.

37:55.482 --> 37:57.650
God, that's so sad.

37:58.860 --> 38:01.570
Because that's exactly
what I was just thinking.

38:01.696 --> 38:04.073
That maybe you're playing me,
that you canceled my call.

38:04.199 --> 38:07.910
That this was just some revenge
to get back at me for Dubai.

38:09.245 --> 38:12.498
Then I'm thinking how terrible it is
that I think that way.

38:12.582 --> 38:15.376
Then I realize we both think that way.

38:17.879 --> 38:19.546
Then I'm thinking,

38:20.674 --> 38:23.217
is that what makes this so worth it?

38:24.552 --> 38:26.053
Is that it?

38:28.056 --> 38:31.392
That I know you're thinking
exactly what I'm thinking?

38:31.518 --> 38:36.438
Because then I'm thinking, do we both
think like that because of what we do?

38:36.564 --> 38:39.566
Are we good at what we do
because we think like that?

38:39.693 --> 38:41.986
Everybody thinks like that.
They just don't say it.

38:42.070 --> 38:45.114
-Civilians don't think like that.
-Bullshit.

38:45.240 --> 38:49.952
-Nobody trusts anybody. We just cop to it.
-Okay. So cop to it.

38:50.078 --> 38:52.997
-Me? I think you better go first.
-Why? What am I hiding?

38:53.081 --> 38:55.416
This wasn't an accident, was it?

38:56.042 --> 38:58.627
Being here. Meeting like this.

39:00.755 --> 39:02.464
You came looking for me, didn't you?

39:02.590 --> 39:05.843
-You'd like that, wouldn't you?
-I'm right, though, aren't I?

39:05.927 --> 39:08.137
Because you went looking for me, right?

39:08.263 --> 39:10.389
But why? Just for this?

39:10.473 --> 39:12.808
-Isn't that enough?
-Not for you.

39:14.144 --> 39:16.228
What are we into, Claire?

39:18.606 --> 39:21.108
Can you imagine living like this?

39:21.776 --> 39:25.446
-How much fun we could have?
-Aren't we in enough trouble?

39:25.822 --> 39:27.823
I mean, having the money.

39:28.950 --> 39:31.952
-Keep going.
-How much do you think we'd need?

39:34.289 --> 39:37.124
-$20 million?
-I was thinking 40.

39:40.253 --> 39:43.297
So what do you have to do
to get $40 million?

39:44.674 --> 39:46.800
Go private.

39:46.926 --> 39:48.677
Be smart.

39:48.803 --> 39:50.554
Get lucky.

39:50.638 --> 39:52.097
How smart?

39:53.141 --> 39:55.809
Smart enough to pick the right partner.

39:56.978 --> 39:59.271
-Private, you mean...
-Corporate.

39:59.355 --> 40:00.689
And lucky?

40:02.650 --> 40:05.027
Be someplace when something's happening.

40:05.153 --> 40:07.404
Be there first, hear it first.

40:07.489 --> 40:09.948
-Something inside.
-Something big.

40:10.033 --> 40:13.535
-But do it up right.
-Set it deep. Take your time.

40:13.661 --> 40:16.163
Know your way out before you go in.

40:18.833 --> 40:22.336
-You know what I think?
-I think you like the idea.

40:22.462 --> 40:26.298
-I think you missed me.
-I think you canceled my call.

40:27.175 --> 40:30.010
So, we're even.

40:41.523 --> 40:43.107
DUKE: Yeah, copy that.

40:43.191 --> 40:45.150
Okay, so you hold tight.

40:45.235 --> 40:48.112
No, we're just around the corner from you.

40:48.196 --> 40:50.030
I'll be standing by.

40:50.698 --> 40:52.699
-FETYOV: He's moving?
-Yep.

40:52.826 --> 40:55.536
So very simple, very basic, right?

40:55.662 --> 40:57.788
The plan is good. It's up to him.

40:57.872 --> 41:00.040
He's got a great reputation.

41:02.210 --> 41:05.045
Look, Garsik says the sky is falling
in six days.

41:05.171 --> 41:07.756
If you got a better idea, tell me now.

41:08.424 --> 41:10.342
Right. So get to work.

41:29.237 --> 41:31.947
Look at this. I am so sorry.

Here I am, squeezing around,
making a complete pig of myself.

41:38.746 --> 41:40.873
Look at this. Are you...

41:40.957 --> 41:43.292
I'm fine. Really. It's nothing.

41:43.793 --> 41:46.003
What was it before I got here?

41:46.754 --> 41:48.297
Appletini.

41:48.423 --> 41:50.966
Well, that sounds good. Was it good?

41:51.426 --> 41:54.344
Yes, they're very good. They're great.

41:54.429 --> 41:56.763
We'll have two of those, please.

42:01.352 --> 42:03.020
You coming or going?

42:03.104 --> 42:06.440
Well, I woke up in Knoxville,
I'm supposed to be sleeping in Belgium,

42:06.524 --> 42:09.318
and here I am in New York
waiting for an Appleteen.

42:09.444 --> 42:11.653
So, I guess I'm just not sure.

42:15.450 --> 42:18.952
-My daddy was from Tennessee.
-You're kidding. Where?

42:19.037 --> 42:21.830
-Western part of the state.
-Where?

42:22.165 --> 42:26.627
Just a little town.
It was actually named after our family.

42:33.134 --> 42:35.552
-Is this some kind ofjoke?
-No. Not at all.

42:35.637 --> 42:39.556
I used to go fishing in Bofferd.
I grew up in Darnum, next county over.

Well, that's my name! Bofferd.
Barbara Bofferd. Here, look.

I'm Jimmy Tierney.

-You don't seem like a Jimmy.
-Well, actually it's James.

42:57.992 --> 43:01.411
Well, actually, it's Dr. Tierney.
Would you excuse me?

43:02.372 --> 43:04.373
Yeah, did you get them?

43:06.376 --> 43:08.710
Nobody there can help me out?

43:09.879 --> 43:12.214
What, and wait at the airport all night?

I was supposed to fly to Brussels tonight
and then on to Nairobi

43:37.240 --> 43:40.659
but my ticket got scrambled.
So, I got on a flight in the morning,

43:40.743 --> 43:42.828
but now they're telling me
it's too late to get ticketed now,

43:42.912 --> 43:45.122
so I'm gonna have to spend the night
at the airport

43:45.206 --> 43:47.749
just to make sure I can get on the plane.

43:47.875 --> 43:51.461
Now, all you need is a flight to Brussels
in the morning?

-PAM: How many eyes do you have?

45:04.118 --> 45:05.702
For Christ's sake, Duke!

-You're getting that to go, right?
-Why?

45:11.626 --> 45:15.295
-Didn't you get the text?
-I don't know. I just stepped out.

45:15.380 --> 45:18.799
-Did you read my memo last month?
-Which one?

45:19.175 --> 45:21.968
Vulnerabilities at the travel office.

45:22.345 --> 45:24.054
I don't remember.

45:24.472 --> 45:26.139
See you upstairs.

DUKE: Okay, so what are we looking at here?
Give me a ballpark figure.

45:31.646 --> 45:33.688
-Around 1 0, 1 2 minutes.
-And then what, I get everything?

45:33.815 --> 45:35.607
Six years of travel orders.

-Eight minutes. Eight minutes.
-Great.

JEFF: Yeah, if he is, he's new.
We don't have him logged.

some fresh players out there.

No, I want her over here.

-And Claire's doing the interview.

-No.

Burkett & Randle has a new product.

Assumption B,
they didn't develop it internally.

46:52.894 --> 46:54.019
DUKE: I agree.

PAM: So, we took every company
B&R bought in the last 1 8 months.

46:57.815 --> 46:59.524
They made 57 acquisitions.

46:59.609 --> 47:02.694
We tossed out anything where the product
was known or already on the market.

47:02.778 --> 47:05.822
-We ended up with...
-Twenty-eight, the 28 companies.

47:05.907 --> 47:08.074
We can't dig deep on any of them.
We don't have time.

47:08.159 --> 47:10.243

when B&R bought seven companies
in one afternoon.

-No.

-I think it's Dunwoody, Georgia.

50:53.509 --> 50:56.970
I'm sorry,
but two months is just too goddamn long.

50:57.471 --> 51:00.724
What? Did you... Did you push
your appointment up? You go in early?

51:00.808 --> 51:03.143
It was fine. There wasn't that much to it.

51:03.227 --> 51:04.853
-You did it, right?
-What?

51:04.979 --> 51:06.688
-You told them.
-Of course.

51:06.814 --> 51:09.983
-And you're okay with it?
-I'd better be, right?

51:13.195 --> 51:14.320
How?

51:17.032 --> 51:18.074
(NERVOUS CHUCKLE)

51:18.492 --> 51:19.743
How...

51:20.995 --> 51:22.454
How did you do it? You just...

51:22.538 --> 51:23.705
(CLEARS THROAT)

51:23.831 --> 51:27.417
-You walked in and what, said, "I quit"?
-Basically.

51:27.501 --> 51:30.378
-They must have tried to talk you out of it.
-Not really, no.

51:30.504 --> 51:33.089
Well, they can't be happy to see you go.
It couldn't have been that easy.

51:33.174 --> 51:35.508
What are you trying to tell me?

51:37.011 --> 51:39.304
-You didn't do it, did you?
-Hang on.

51:39.388 --> 51:41.681
There's no way
that they just let you just walk out.

51:41.766 --> 51:44.809
-Wait.
-You just punched out? Just walked out?

51:44.894 --> 51:46.102
No, no, no, no, no. Hang on.

51:46.187 --> 51:48.104
-Answer the question.
-Did they ask you to stay?

51:48.189 --> 51:49.939
-You're ducking the question.
-They did, didn't they?

51:50.024 --> 51:52.108
-This is classic.
-They asked you to stay.

51:52.193 --> 51:54.235
-I know this drill, okay.
-Did you quit or not?

51:54.361 --> 51:56.029
Deny everything. Admit nothing.

51:56.113 --> 51:58.281
-Make counter-accusations.
-That's what you're doing.

51:58.365 --> 52:00.492
I asked you how it went and you evaded!

52:00.576 --> 52:04.454
How it went?
I just terminated a 1 2-year career with MI6.

52:04.538 --> 52:06.247
I spent an hour
signing non-disclosure forms,

52:06.373 --> 52:08.625
I did a quick outplacement polygraph,
I turned in my credentials

52:08.709 --> 52:10.543
and I walked out
on the only job I've ever really had,

52:10.628 --> 52:13.505
and now, right now,
I'm getting the very distinct impression

52:13.589 --> 52:18.051
that you changed your mind,
kept your job, and left me out in the cold.

52:18.886 --> 52:20.512
They kind of begged me to stay.

52:20.596 --> 52:23.765
And you don't call
to tell me that this morning?

52:23.891 --> 52:25.600
I couldn't risk it.

52:25.726 --> 52:27.977
You're unbelievable.

52:28.062 --> 52:31.397
-I was completely surprised.
-I don't believe this.

52:32.566 --> 52:34.859
I hope you kept your passports.

52:34.944 --> 52:36.653
What am I supposed to do? I can't go back.

52:36.737 --> 52:38.822
You have to turn in a couple
to make it look good, but...

52:38.906 --> 52:40.406
I am totally cooked.

52:40.491 --> 52:42.784
...we're gonna need decent passports.

52:42.910 --> 52:45.078
What are you talking about?

52:45.746 --> 52:48.540
I took everything I could get my hands on.

52:48.624 --> 52:50.500
After they begged me.

52:53.420 --> 52:54.796
You bitch.

53:02.596 --> 53:05.515
(WHISPERS) Admit it.
You don't trust me, either.

53:26.328 --> 53:28.288
So, the total footprint.

53:28.372 --> 53:32.333
That's if you're interested in both buildings,
'cause they're both available right now.

53:32.459 --> 53:37.463
It's about 22,000 square feet.
The ventilation, it's zoned.

53:37.548 --> 53:42.969
And you've got separate filtration systems
for the lab, office, storage and loading.

53:43.053 --> 53:45.722
-It's lovely and clean.
-Yes, indeed.

53:45.806 --> 53:49.017
The last tenants left the place
in terrific shape. It's just spotless.

53:49.143 --> 53:50.685
What kind of business were they in?

53:50.811 --> 53:55.189
REALTOR: Formavale? Damned if I know.
Some kind of biotech.

53:55.316 --> 53:58.318
They took the place, loaded in their gear
and that's about the last we saw of them.

53:58.402 --> 54:01.487
Hell, they used to truck out their own trash.

54:04.408 --> 54:07.660
Cronin Partiz. Ronnie Partiz.

54:07.745 --> 54:10.204
Dr. Ronald Partiz.

54:10.331 --> 54:12.874
This is 1 0 years ago up in Albany.

54:13.417 --> 54:17.045
He's graduating high school,
1 5 years old in that picture,

54:17.171 --> 54:18.963
but he's a smart kid.

54:19.048 --> 54:21.299
He gets a free ride to Cornell.

54:21.383 --> 54:23.468
He finds his way
into the biochemistry department.

54:23.552 --> 54:25.136
Two years later, he's in med school.

54:25.346 --> 54:27.931
PAM: He's 1 8, he's doing research
with some heavy hitters,

54:28.015 --> 54:30.892
he's getting good evaIuations,
he's roIIing aIong.

54:31.018 --> 54:36.189
1 999, he publishes an article in a magazine
called American DermatoIogist.

54:36.273 --> 54:39.025
-About?
-Something about a fungus.

54:39.735 --> 54:41.194
What kind of fungus?

54:41.278 --> 54:42.445
DUKE: lt doesn't matter.

54:42.529 --> 54:44.197
RlCHARD: Doesn't matter?
Everything matters.

54:44.281 --> 54:48.117
He plagiarized it. He stole it.
He got caught immediately.

54:48.744 --> 54:52.163
PAM: They bounced him out of Cornell.
He set up shop in his parents' garage,

54:52.247 --> 54:55.333
started working on some kind of skin cream.

54:55.417 --> 54:57.043
DUKE: Yeah, something called...

54:57.127 --> 54:58.544
-What?
-PAM: Spring Skin.

54:58.629 --> 55:01.547
He tried to sell it to health food stores
in the area up there.

55:01.632 --> 55:04.384
Now, you're sure this is a cream
or was it a lotion?

55:04.468 --> 55:07.595
-Because a lot of people confuse the two.
-I don't know.

55:07.721 --> 55:12.433
Well, for Christ's sake, Duke, let's have that!
Let's have that! I mean, if...

55:12.559 --> 55:15.895
If there is even a chance that this guy
is Tully's secret weapon,

55:15.980 --> 55:18.856
we're gonna need a hell of a lot more
than his goddamn grade point average!

55:18.941 --> 55:22.443
You gotta get me his cream!
Show me the cream!

55:22.569 --> 55:26.280
Dick, he went bankrupt overnight.
It was a bust, okay.

55:26.407 --> 55:30.159
We don't think the cream
is the answer here.

55:30.244 --> 55:33.246
So, Ronnie Partiz
now goes deep underground.

55:33.414 --> 55:36.582
2002, 2003, nothing.

55:36.667 --> 55:40.336
It's as if he doesn't exist.
No taxes, no bank records, nothing.

55:40.421 --> 55:44.132
Then, two years ago,
he walks into a bank in Atlanta

55:44.258 --> 55:50.847
and produces a $500,000 letter of credit
and a business card from Formavale.

55:51.348 --> 55:53.099
DUKE: Now, we've been working hard,
we've been working fast

55:53.183 --> 55:54.934
and yet we can't find anything
about Formavale.

55:55.019 --> 55:57.353
We don't have a vendor,
we don't have an insurance company,

55:57.438 --> 55:58.771
we don't have anybody down there

55:58.856 --> 56:01.524
who knows anything about
what the hell Formavale does.

56:01.608 --> 56:03.985
PAM: We're working these
New York travel records.

56:04.111 --> 56:06.821
Howard Tully bouncing down to Dunwoody
like a busboy.

56:06.947 --> 56:11.325
DUKE: Yeah, and two days after RonaId Partiz
sells Formavale Labs to B&R,

56:11.452 --> 56:13.453
three armored trucks
puII up outside the buiIding.

56:13.537 --> 56:16.664
PAM: Not only that,
B&R sends a security detail down there

56:16.790 --> 56:19.125
to guard the Ioad out,
which takes pIace at night.

56:19.209 --> 56:22.420
And consider that B&R has yet to disclose
their financial statements

56:22.504 --> 56:23.755
showing the acquisition.

56:23.839 --> 56:28.509
And then add the fact that Ronnie Partiz
has been living for the last six months

56:28.635 --> 56:34.932
in a $10,000-a-day penthouse suite
at the Atlantis Hotel in the Bahamas.

56:35.017 --> 56:38.519
And the coup de grâce,
toss in the fact that he is playing baccarat

56:38.645 --> 56:40.980
whenever he's sober enough
to make his way down to the tabIes

56:41.065 --> 56:43.566
to the tune of $300,000 a week.

56:43.650 --> 56:46.944
Duke, God damn it,
you gotta stop waltzing around,

56:47.029 --> 56:49.572
and you have got to get on this guy.

57:25.567 --> 57:27.610
You can forget his room.

57:27.861 --> 57:31.531
It's like Fort Knox up there.
It'd be a major operation.

57:31.907 --> 57:34.700
-I told you.
-So what do you wanna do?

57:36.870 --> 57:38.371
Have a drink.

58:52.946 --> 58:54.697
Turn-down service.

58:58.827 --> 59:00.286
(INDISTINCT CHATTERING)

59:20.140 --> 59:22.850
This is a waste of time.
You wanna just sit here all night?

59:22.976 --> 59:26.979
Look at him, he's paralyzed.
He couldn't leave if he wanted to.

59:28.690 --> 59:32.109
Why don't you give me the credit card,
let me get in the game.

59:32.194 --> 59:34.278
It's a $5,000 table.

59:34.363 --> 59:37.031
That's okay. I'll share my winnings.

59:37.658 --> 59:38.991
Forget it.

59:54.216 --> 59:56.342
FETYOV: Look, maybe you're right.

59:56.843 --> 59:59.095
Maybe tonight he goes nowhere.

59:59.930 --> 01:00:01.555
What we do?

01:00:01.682 --> 01:00:04.725
Tonight we watch like this, and tomorrow...

01:00:05.519 --> 01:00:09.522
Tomorrow, we'll find somebody
who works upstairs in those rooms, okay?

01:00:09.606 --> 01:00:11.607
SECURITY: How's it going, fellows?

01:00:11.692 --> 01:00:15.194
-Yeah, we're good, thanks. Very good.
-SECURITY: Glad to hear it.

01:00:15.279 --> 01:00:17.947
I'm hoping you could help me out.

01:00:18.031 --> 01:00:20.866
I need to take a look at your room keys.

01:00:22.369 --> 01:00:24.495
Well, this is interesting.

01:00:24.579 --> 01:00:26.205
SECURITY: Yeah, it is interesting.

01:00:26.290 --> 01:00:31.085
A maid just found a whole bunch
of crazy stuff in a couple of rooms upstairs.

01:00:31.712 --> 01:00:33.796
So here's what we're going to do.

01:00:33.880 --> 01:00:34.922
The drinks are comped.

01:00:35.048 --> 01:00:36.048
(CLEARS THROAT)

01:00:36.383 --> 01:00:38.759
We're gonna have to take a walk.

01:00:39.386 --> 01:00:41.137
And I mean now.

01:00:47.394 --> 01:00:50.229

01:01:12.669 --> 01:01:14.503
This is so heavy.

Who do you think he is?

01:01:17.090 --> 01:01:20.301
It's gotta be this thing.
This new thing, right?

01:01:21.261 --> 01:01:22.636
Makes sense.

01:01:23.096 --> 01:01:25.014
What else could it be?

(EXHALES DEEPLY)

01:02:08.475 --> 01:02:10.017
-Hey, I was getting worried.
-I got off the plane,

-I thought for a minute I was being tailed.
-By who?

01:02:12.854 --> 01:02:14.730
I don't know.
I was probably just being paranoid.

01:02:14.815 --> 01:02:16.190
Well, that's crazy. Nobody knows we're here.

01:02:16.316 --> 01:02:19.151
I know. I know, but I didn't know
what else to do. I had to run it out.

01:02:19.236 --> 01:02:22.029
I've been driving in circles for two hours.
I just... I didn't know what else to do.

01:02:22.155 --> 01:02:25.282
I wanted to call, and I just thought, "My God,
we've got everything on the line here."

01:02:25.367 --> 01:02:27.993
I didn't want to start off sloppy.

01:02:28.912 --> 01:02:32.289
-God, you smell good.
-Please, I smell like a rental car.

01:02:32.374 --> 01:02:34.834
Wow. This is amazing.

01:02:35.544 --> 01:02:38.379
-I upgraded.
-This is more than an upgrade.

01:02:38.505 --> 01:02:43.092
We're celebrating. I've got some good news.
Well, actually, it's more than good news.

01:02:43.176 --> 01:02:45.469
-I nailed it.
-Nailed what?

01:02:45.554 --> 01:02:50.015
We're in. I got it. The answer. The key.
The master plan. I nailed it!

01:02:50.600 --> 01:02:52.435
You're kidding.

01:02:52.519 --> 01:02:56.939
-Come here. Sit down. Just sit down.
-Okay.

01:02:58.525 --> 01:03:02.570
How much money do you think was spent
on frozen pizza last year?

01:03:03.071 --> 01:03:06.115
-What?
-Frozen pizza. How big is the market?

01:03:07.075 --> 01:03:10.786
$1 billion. One billion. That's just the pizza.

01:03:10.871 --> 01:03:13.998
I'm not talking enchiladas, blintzes,
macaroni and cheese.

01:03:14.082 --> 01:03:16.876
Just pizza. Master plan, right?

01:03:17.210 --> 01:03:19.753
Objective one, huge market. Got it.

01:03:20.297 --> 01:03:22.590
Objective two, conflict, right?

01:03:22.716 --> 01:03:24.967
Find a market where the competitors
hate each other so much,

01:03:25.051 --> 01:03:26.343
they'll do anything to win.

01:03:26.428 --> 01:03:29.430
We get involved, we lead the charge.
When the price is right, we ditch.

01:03:29.556 --> 01:03:31.348
All we gotta do is find an angle.

01:03:31.433 --> 01:03:34.226
Maybe we flip sides,
maybe we shop the intel,

01:03:34.311 --> 01:03:38.147
buy stock, sell it, whatever.
There's a hundred ways to go.

01:03:38.231 --> 01:03:40.191
There's this company
called Butter Mills, okay.

01:03:40.275 --> 01:03:41.609
Now, about two months ago,

01:03:41.735 --> 01:03:45.779
the CEO, Mr. Butter Mills, sitting at home,
watching TV with his granddaughter.

01:03:45.906 --> 01:03:47.448
There's this ad
comes on in the morning cartoons

01:03:47.574 --> 01:03:49.950
for something called Double Crust Pizza.

01:03:50.076 --> 01:03:52.536
This guy's been working on
double-crust pizza for five years,

01:03:52.621 --> 01:03:56.165
got $50 million invested,
major new product for him.

01:03:56.249 --> 01:03:59.084
Trouble is, he hasn't rolled it out yet.

01:03:59.669 --> 01:04:03.339
The ad he's watching
is for Flakey Fresh Double Crust.

01:04:03.924 --> 01:04:08.010
They stole his concept, his formula,
his packaging and his ad campaign.

01:04:08.094 --> 01:04:09.637
So Mr. Butter Mills is out for blood.

01:04:09.763 --> 01:04:12.014
They're taking off the gloves.
They're bringing out the check book.

01:04:12.098 --> 01:04:13.724
Here's the best part...

01:04:13.808 --> 01:04:17.269
Guess who they like
for Director of Intel Operations?

01:04:17.646 --> 01:04:19.605
I took a job yesterday.

01:04:21.107 --> 01:04:23.526
-What?
-That's why I was paranoid.

01:04:25.529 --> 01:04:28.072
What do you mean, you took a job?

01:04:28.156 --> 01:04:30.950
It's not like I could call and tell you.

01:04:31.326 --> 01:04:33.202
I don't believe this.

01:04:34.788 --> 01:04:36.288
What happened to doing it together?

01:04:36.373 --> 01:04:38.916
-Well, it was just too good...
-No, we had a plan.

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:40.960
You know, we agreed.
We said we'd go over everything.

01:04:41.044 --> 01:04:44.672
We go over it. We do it together.
We said nobody moves alone.

01:04:44.798 --> 01:04:47.174
-Ray, please.
-Well, can you get out of it?

01:04:47.300 --> 01:04:51.428
Well, of course you can.
You haven't even started yet. Claire...

01:04:51.513 --> 01:04:53.556
Claire, look, I know that we said
that we're gonna go out there,

01:04:53.640 --> 01:04:55.266
get two jobs
and see which one comes up best,

01:04:55.350 --> 01:04:57.768
but with this, the pizza,

01:04:57.852 --> 01:05:00.854
I mean, we can push up the whole timetable.
It's perfect.

01:05:00.981 --> 01:05:02.856
And we can be together.

01:05:03.400 --> 01:05:06.860
Look, I take the job,
you start working out the exit strategy.

01:05:06.987 --> 01:05:10.239
You know, you build up our ID, you set up
the banks, offshore trading accounts.

01:05:10.323 --> 01:05:13.576
Whatever we need, you get it
up and running and then I bring you in, see.

01:05:13.660 --> 01:05:15.536
I'm gonna need to staff up.
You'll apply, we'll meet.

01:05:15.662 --> 01:05:19.498
We'll like each other, hate each other,
whatever works best.

01:05:21.042 --> 01:05:23.252
Who'd you take the job with?

01:05:23.670 --> 01:05:25.087
Equikrom.

01:05:25.672 --> 01:05:28.007
-Local?
-New York.

01:05:29.426 --> 01:05:31.427
It's two jobs actually.

01:05:32.554 --> 01:05:34.179
Equikrom wants to hire me under the table,

01:05:34.264 --> 01:05:36.724
and then get me a job
on the counterintelligence desk

01:05:36.850 --> 01:05:38.767
for Burkett & Randle.

01:05:38.852 --> 01:05:41.061
They want you to be a mole?

01:05:41.938 --> 01:05:43.355
Equikrom?

01:05:44.524 --> 01:05:45.899
In New York?

01:05:48.862 --> 01:05:50.904
Where's the pizza thing?

01:05:52.699 --> 01:05:54.074
Cleveland.

01:05:55.869 --> 01:05:58.412
You said they offered you the job.

01:05:59.873 --> 01:06:01.999
Of course they did. They love me.

01:06:02.083 --> 01:06:05.044
-You took it on the spot.
-What, like you?

01:06:07.213 --> 01:06:09.214
Nothing was formalized.

01:06:13.553 --> 01:06:15.888
CLAIRE: Look, seriously,
I don't have to take it.

01:06:15.972 --> 01:06:18.223
Oh, yeah, that makes sense.

01:06:18.308 --> 01:06:21.060
CLAIRE: How are we ever
gonna see each other?

01:06:21.144 --> 01:06:23.145
RAY: Very, very carefully.

01:06:25.982 --> 01:06:28.400
CLAIRE: This is what we wanted, right?

01:06:29.569 --> 01:06:31.236
RAY: I think so.

01:06:33.573 --> 01:06:34.907
CLAIRE: Come here.

01:06:53.218 --> 01:06:54.718
Ms. Stenwick?

01:07:00.350 --> 01:07:02.434
HOWARD: Someone made fire.

01:07:04.437 --> 01:07:06.105
Someone was first.

01:07:07.899 --> 01:07:10.859
I don't mean the idiot who found
a burning stick and kept it going.

01:07:10.944 --> 01:07:13.612
I mean the fellow who could make fire.

01:07:15.615 --> 01:07:18.534
And until that knowledge was stolen,

01:07:19.911 --> 01:07:23.455
that fellow was the most powerful person
on the planet.

01:07:25.792 --> 01:07:29.044
And it means something to be first.

01:07:30.296 --> 01:07:31.755
To be most.

01:07:33.800 --> 01:07:35.801
It means a great deal.

01:07:36.970 --> 01:07:41.306
It means you have an opportunity
to reproduce with the highest frequency

01:07:41.433 --> 01:07:44.143
and with the most desirable partners.

01:07:44.477 --> 01:07:48.063
It means your offspring
have the greatest chance of survival

01:07:48.148 --> 01:07:51.400
and a better opportunity
to make their own fire.

01:07:52.152 --> 01:07:55.738
I personally believe that human evolution
has run its course.

01:07:55.822 --> 01:07:58.240
We live in a world where the people
who can make fire

01:07:58.324 --> 01:08:00.159
have a tendency to wear condoms,

01:08:00.243 --> 01:08:03.495
sit in casinos
and drink themselves into a stupor.

01:08:04.622 --> 01:08:08.500
I believe that individual evolution
has been replaced by something else.

01:08:08.626 --> 01:08:11.503
By a shared evolution.

01:08:12.505 --> 01:08:15.132
A communal contest, if you will.

01:08:15.842 --> 01:08:19.178
I believe, Ms. Stenwick,
in corporate evolution.

01:08:21.096 --> 01:08:24.683
I believe that the corporation that is first,
that is the most,

01:08:24.768 --> 01:08:27.935
has an opportunity to manufacture
with the highest frequency

01:08:28.020 --> 01:08:30.189
and in the most desirable markets,

01:08:30.314 --> 01:08:32.441
and that its shareholders, by extension,

01:08:32.524 --> 01:08:36.361
have the greatest chance of survival
and reinvestment.

01:08:38.823 --> 01:08:42.533
I don't imagine you're quite aware
of the service

01:08:43.036 --> 01:08:46.622
you and Mr. Bauer
provided this corporation last night.

01:08:46.706 --> 01:08:49.124
We were just doing our job, sir.

01:08:49.709 --> 01:08:52.044
Mr. Partiz may appear a fool,

01:08:52.545 --> 01:08:53.796
(LAUGHING)

01:08:53.880 --> 01:08:55.881
but he is anything but.

01:08:56.006 --> 01:09:00.301
He has given Burkett & Randle a gift
that will change our business,

01:09:00.386 --> 01:09:02.888
our lives, forever.

01:09:04.474 --> 01:09:06.892
So the question, Ms. Stenwick,

01:09:07.018 --> 01:09:11.897
is whether you can continue to do the job
we so desperately need you to do

01:09:12.732 --> 01:09:15.484
without knowing the stakes involved.

01:09:16.027 --> 01:09:20.823
Can you really do your job without knowing
what it is that you're protecting?

01:09:26.746 --> 01:09:28.747
What I need to know is,

01:09:32.085 --> 01:09:35.002
can I share my fire with you?

01:09:40.343 --> 01:09:42.261
DUKE: Little trouble out there
in the field, Ray?

01:09:42.345 --> 01:09:43.345
RAY: What do you mean?

01:09:43.429 --> 01:09:46.098
DUKE: Well, I just got
a back channel message from Claire,

01:09:46.224 --> 01:09:47.765
she wants to meet Garsik.

01:09:47.850 --> 01:09:49.100
RAY: That's a terrible idea.

01:09:49.227 --> 01:09:52.770
DUKE: Yeah, that's what I told him.
But now he wants direct contact.

01:09:52.897 --> 01:09:54.231
RAY: Forget it.

01:09:57.277 --> 01:10:00.279
-It's his dime.
-Yeah, and she's my agent.

01:10:00.405 --> 01:10:03.532
I told you when I came on board.
Once she's mine, I run her my way.

01:10:03.616 --> 01:10:08.245
Yeah, well the question's been raised, Ray,
is it just her you're running?

01:10:11.416 --> 01:10:13.792
You'd better explain that to me.

01:10:15.420 --> 01:10:19.131
RAY OVER PHONE: American Consulate,
Dubai, you and me, Fourth of JuIy, 2003.

01:10:19.215 --> 01:10:20.465
CLAlRE OVER PHONE:
Find someone else to bother.

01:10:20.550 --> 01:10:22.718
RAY: Red, white and bIue margaritas.
CLAlRE: Stay away from me.

01:10:22.802 --> 01:10:27.639
RAY: I had a knee brace, you had toe rings.
First toe ring I ever saw, by the way.

01:10:28.474 --> 01:10:32.477
Well, I'll give her this.
She is one cold, nasty piece of work.

01:10:33.605 --> 01:10:37.649
-When did she send this to you?
-She didn't tape it. You did.

01:10:38.484 --> 01:10:41.570
We had a bug in your phone.
We had the whole thing wired.

01:10:41.654 --> 01:10:45.824
Hey, we had to. New guy on the team?
This late in the game?

01:10:45.909 --> 01:10:49.745
What can I tell you?
The bitch put me through the wringer.

01:10:50.079 --> 01:10:52.414
Look, if I'd have known it was her,
I would never have taken the job.

01:10:52.498 --> 01:10:56.960
-No, no. You didn't tell us the truth, Ray.
-Are you firing me, Duke?

01:10:57.420 --> 01:10:59.046
Why didn't you do it then?
Why not fire me that day?

01:10:59.130 --> 01:11:01.214
-Why keep me around?
-DUKE: Why?

01:11:03.259 --> 01:11:09.389
Because you're the biggest swinging dick
I've ever seen.

01:11:10.934 --> 01:11:12.309
(BOTH LAUGHING)

01:11:16.064 --> 01:11:19.066
Come on! We thought we were losing her.

01:11:19.150 --> 01:11:22.277
We thought we'd had her out there too long
and she'd gone off the rails.

01:11:22.362 --> 01:11:24.112
And that's why we brought you in.

01:11:24.197 --> 01:11:27.407
But this?
This is more than we ever expected.

01:11:27.492 --> 01:11:31.036
When you drop the hammer on her,
when you take her to the bar...

01:11:31.120 --> 01:11:32.955
CLAlRE OVER PHONE:
You've 10 seconds to get your hand off me.

01:11:33.039 --> 01:11:34.498
RAY OVER PHONE:
Or what? You won't be my friend anymore?

01:11:34.582 --> 01:11:37.751
No, no, no, no, no.
Do the other one. Do the other one.

01:11:37.835 --> 01:11:39.753
-Okay. Here.
-Right.

01:11:39.837 --> 01:11:43.090
RAY: Now, maybe you're so used to having
your Iegs in the air you don't reaIize it,

01:11:43.174 --> 01:11:45.300
but you're upside down, sister.

01:11:45.843 --> 01:11:47.469
I own you.

01:11:48.137 --> 01:11:50.806
Damn! Man, I wish I had video on this!

01:11:50.890 --> 01:11:52.683
"I own you."

01:11:53.977 --> 01:11:57.312
-Who else knows about this?
-Just me, just me and Dale.

01:11:57.397 --> 01:11:59.439
So you were just kidding
about the meet with Garsik, right?

01:11:59.524 --> 01:12:01.692
No, no. That's for real.
But don't worry about her.

01:12:01.776 --> 01:12:04.569
I mean, obviously, she doesn't need to know
that we know what's going on,

01:12:04.654 --> 01:12:07.197
so you just keep...
You know, just play it straight.

01:12:07.281 --> 01:12:08.448
Of course.

01:12:08.533 --> 01:12:11.535
RAY: l don't know. l mean,
I'm not great on names. I shouId be. I try.

01:12:11.619 --> 01:12:14.621
Faces, I'm definiteIy better.
Faces, l'm like a B, B minus.

01:12:14.706 --> 01:12:18.542
Where I'm good, where I reaIIy exceI,
peopIe I've sIept with.

01:12:18.626 --> 01:12:19.710
(BOTH LAUGHING)

01:12:19.794 --> 01:12:21.670
-"I own you."
-"I own you."

01:12:21.754 --> 01:12:23.797
-"I own you."
-DALE: "I own you."

01:12:24.257 --> 01:12:26.258
(BOTH LAUGHING)

01:13:17.935 --> 01:13:19.895
You should have called.

01:13:20.563 --> 01:13:23.023
I could have been home hours ago.

01:13:27.528 --> 01:13:29.905
-Where's your bag?
-I'm on the red-eye.

01:13:29.989 --> 01:13:31.740
-No.
-I'm supposed to be in Houston.

01:13:31.824 --> 01:13:34.659
I had to blow my connection. It was
the only way I'd steal a couple of hours.

01:13:34.744 --> 01:13:35.827
You should have paged me.

01:13:35.912 --> 01:13:39.039
I've been sitting in the office
doing field reports, for Christ's sake.

01:13:39.123 --> 01:13:40.624
I couldn't risk it.

01:13:40.708 --> 01:13:43.376
-From a pay phone?
-Not from anywhere.

01:13:44.170 --> 01:13:46.630
Why? What's going on?

01:13:48.299 --> 01:13:51.218
-Nigel Bingham.
-Nigel Bingham?

01:13:51.302 --> 01:13:54.346
-You were together in Athens.
-He was my station chief.

01:13:54.430 --> 01:13:57.057
-You still on good terms?
-Great. Why?

01:13:57.558 --> 01:13:59.976
Equikrom, the special unit, they're hiring.

01:14:00.061 --> 01:14:03.522
Duke needs a field agent.
I figured out a way to get you in.

01:14:03.606 --> 01:14:06.108
It's happening, Ray. It's war.

01:14:06.192 --> 01:14:09.778
-What do you mean, war?
-I mean like a total corporate death match.

01:14:09.862 --> 01:14:12.948
We're on. B&R is about to make a move.

01:14:13.032 --> 01:14:16.409
-What kind of move?
-Some new product. Something big.

01:14:16.494 --> 01:14:18.245
What do you mean, "big"?

01:14:18.329 --> 01:14:22.666
Big, big like we've had four top-down
tech sweeps in the last two weeks.

01:14:22.750 --> 01:14:27.003
Big like three days ago
we started auditing passwords hourly.

01:14:27.421 --> 01:14:29.756
This morning I got a message from Duke.

01:14:29.841 --> 01:14:32.717
He wants me to go active.
I'm gonna get word to him tomorrow

01:14:32.802 --> 01:14:36.638
that unless he gets me a great field officer
to work with he can forget it.

01:14:36.722 --> 01:14:39.141
You're gonna get that job.

01:14:39.225 --> 01:14:40.976
Without knowing what the product is?

01:14:41.060 --> 01:14:43.395
Well, that's the point. Nobody knows.

01:14:43.479 --> 01:14:45.355
All we have to do is get there first.

01:14:45.439 --> 01:14:48.608
You on one side, me on the other.
It's perfect.

01:14:49.527 --> 01:14:52.362
What does all this have to do
with Nigel Bingham?

01:14:52.446 --> 01:14:55.073
He's Duke's drinking buddy.
They play cards twice a week.

01:14:55.158 --> 01:14:56.199
You call Nigel.

01:14:56.284 --> 01:14:58.368
You're just checking in,
you're stuck in Cleveland,

01:14:58.452 --> 01:15:00.579
you're going crazy,
you're calling everybody.

01:15:00.663 --> 01:15:03.415
Tell him you're desperate to get to New York.

01:15:03.499 --> 01:15:06.209
Aren't you desperate to get to New York?

01:15:06.294 --> 01:15:10.589
-Well, yeah, of course I am, but it's just...
-Just what?

01:15:10.673 --> 01:15:13.466
Well, the pizza thing's really heating up.

01:15:13.551 --> 01:15:16.595
We're launching Frozen Hawaiian
next month, pineapple and ham.

01:15:16.679 --> 01:15:19.264
First time anyone's ever done that.

01:15:20.474 --> 01:15:21.683
Congratulations.

01:15:21.767 --> 01:15:23.101
Well, it's not the first first time

01:15:23.186 --> 01:15:26.146
'cause those weasels at Flakey Fresh
stole the idea from Butter Mills,

01:15:26.230 --> 01:15:28.023
and then, you'll love this,

01:15:28.107 --> 01:15:31.735
we find out that the Vice President of
Marketing has this 22-year-old assistant

01:15:31.819 --> 01:15:36.114
who's $60,000 in debt
to a TV shopping network. Bingo.

01:15:36.657 --> 01:15:38.033
Really.

01:15:39.869 --> 01:15:41.453
Are these hers?

01:15:42.747 --> 01:15:43.997
What is that?

01:15:44.081 --> 01:15:46.750
It's a thong. It was in your closet.

01:15:49.545 --> 01:15:51.379
That's not possible.

01:15:51.797 --> 01:15:53.757
Well, whose are they?

01:15:54.550 --> 01:15:58.136
-Nobody's because it's impossible.
-Impossible what?

01:15:58.512 --> 01:16:02.515
That someone would leave them,
or you'd forget or that I'd find them?

01:16:02.600 --> 01:16:05.518
Impossible because I've been faithful.
Which closet?

01:16:05.603 --> 01:16:08.146
-Which closet?
-This is insane.

01:16:08.231 --> 01:16:10.523
-You're denying this?
-Absolutely.

01:16:10.608 --> 01:16:13.276
The only woman who's been in this place
since I moved in is the landlady

01:16:13.361 --> 01:16:15.403
and she couldn't wear that as a wristband.

01:16:15.488 --> 01:16:17.364
So where did they come from?

01:16:17.448 --> 01:16:20.242
Look, I swear to you.

01:16:20.326 --> 01:16:22.786
Claire, I swear,
I swear on all things good and true,

01:16:22.870 --> 01:16:25.705
I have no idea who they belong to.
And the fact that you don't believe me,

01:16:25.790 --> 01:16:28.083
the fact that we've been through
everything that we've been through

01:16:28.167 --> 01:16:32.754
and that you still don't trust me on this,
is, quite frankly, disturbing.

01:16:33.589 --> 01:16:36.508
Well, in that case, I'll put them back on.

01:16:37.176 --> 01:16:38.718
They're yours?

01:16:38.803 --> 01:16:40.512
You passed.

01:16:40.596 --> 01:16:42.305
You're gaming me?

01:16:42.390 --> 01:16:44.891
I just needed to hear you say it.

01:16:48.646 --> 01:16:51.356
-You're that upset?
-Yeah, I think so.

01:16:59.615 --> 01:17:02.117
But kind of turned on, too, right?

01:17:04.203 --> 01:17:08.999
The drag is I've only got 55 minutes
to make it up to you.

01:17:51.042 --> 01:17:52.459
RICHARD: Forget it.

01:17:55.296 --> 01:17:57.213
I never liked this game.

01:17:57.298 --> 01:18:01.843
Any sport that puts a limit on your score
is a complete waste of time.

01:18:02.720 --> 01:18:04.846
Three hundred, that's it?

01:18:04.930 --> 01:18:08.892
What, are you gonna bust your nut to do
something 9 million other jokers might do?

01:18:08.976 --> 01:18:10.769
Stupidest damn thing I ever heard of.

01:18:10.853 --> 01:18:14.147
Okay, so don't turn around,
but she just came in.

01:18:15.232 --> 01:18:18.234
-We're cool though, right? She see us?
-Oh, yeah.

01:18:18.319 --> 01:18:21.029
-I look natural, right?
-Super natural.

01:18:25.534 --> 01:18:27.327
Who picked this place?

01:18:27.411 --> 01:18:30.413
-You have a problem?
-It's a little bright.

01:18:31.374 --> 01:18:34.376
-So this gentleman here is...
-I know who he is.

01:18:34.460 --> 01:18:37.796
You do? Even with the hat?

01:18:38.672 --> 01:18:40.882
She's a trained professional.

01:18:40.966 --> 01:18:43.426
Yeah, yeah, I can see that.

01:18:44.178 --> 01:18:46.388
I can definitely...

01:18:47.306 --> 01:18:49.641
Would you...
You know what, we got beers here.

01:18:49.725 --> 01:18:51.142
-Would you care for something?
-She's fine.

01:18:51.227 --> 01:18:54.396
-I'm starving.
-Well, hell, then we should feed you.

01:18:54.480 --> 01:18:56.606
I'd love some pizza.
Do you think they have pizza?

01:18:56.690 --> 01:18:58.400
I'll just bet that they do, yeah.

01:18:58.484 --> 01:19:00.026
-Or even frozen pizza.
-Okay.

01:19:00.111 --> 01:19:02.654
-I don't think so.
-Why don't you go take a look-see?

01:19:02.738 --> 01:19:04.197
You'd smell it if they did.

01:19:04.281 --> 01:19:08.868
I don't give a damn if you have to go
to Sicily, get the lady some pizza!

01:19:11.872 --> 01:19:13.790
Any particular topping you'd like?

01:19:13.874 --> 01:19:15.333
Surprise me.

01:19:20.256 --> 01:19:21.423
BOY: Pepperoni.

01:19:22.633 --> 01:19:24.884
Super Cheese-a-peno.

01:19:25.511 --> 01:19:27.345
Mushroom.

01:19:28.139 --> 01:19:29.931
Mushroom and onion.

01:19:31.350 --> 01:19:33.101
Plain.

01:19:33.811 --> 01:19:35.770
-Hawaiian.
-Plain.

01:19:40.276 --> 01:19:43.736
-Do you like it hot or...
-Yeah, hot. Very hot.

01:19:44.822 --> 01:19:46.364
Extremely hot.

01:19:50.578 --> 01:19:52.495
You want something to drink?

01:19:52.580 --> 01:19:54.622
Yeah, sure, whatever.

01:20:02.047 --> 01:20:04.632
What's going on? What just happened?

01:20:05.092 --> 01:20:06.551
You...

01:20:07.261 --> 01:20:09.095
You gotta get Duke. You gotta get Duke.

01:20:09.180 --> 01:20:12.640
And you've gotta tell him
to get me a secure line

01:20:12.725 --> 01:20:14.142
because he's gotta call me right away.

01:20:14.226 --> 01:20:16.728
-What did she say?
-Secure line.

01:20:16.812 --> 01:20:19.439
Do you understand me?
And only if he is sure.

01:20:19.523 --> 01:20:21.983
I gotta get on the plane,
and he's gotta call me,

01:20:22.067 --> 01:20:24.486
but it has gotta be safe.

01:20:39.752 --> 01:20:42.629
Yeah, it's me. I need Duke. Now.

01:20:44.381 --> 01:20:46.883
Yeah. Well, tell him to hurry up.

01:22:10.884 --> 01:22:12.677
What are you doing?

01:22:13.387 --> 01:22:14.512
Me?

01:22:14.597 --> 01:22:17.307
-How did you get here so fast?
-Not fast enough though, right?

01:22:17.391 --> 01:22:19.475
-You're leaving?
-I didn't think you were coming.

01:22:19.560 --> 01:22:20.768
I left the signal, didn't I?

01:22:20.853 --> 01:22:22.979
You also took your passports
and the travel money.

01:22:23.063 --> 01:22:24.981
Half the money. My half.

01:22:25.065 --> 01:22:28.443
We took a vow. No one touches
the mayday pouch until it's time to bail.

01:22:28.527 --> 01:22:29.611
I trusted you.

01:22:29.695 --> 01:22:32.405
Which explains
why you were in there checking it.

01:22:32.489 --> 01:22:34.073
-When did you do this?
-When?

01:22:34.158 --> 01:22:39.037
About five or six hours after I got done
with Barbara Bofferd from B&R Travel.

01:22:39.830 --> 01:22:41.414
You're kidding.

01:22:42.458 --> 01:22:44.959
-That's what this is about?
-That?

01:22:45.502 --> 01:22:47.920
We're in play, for Christ's sake.
We don't have time for this.

01:22:48.005 --> 01:22:50.298
Why? Is it a long explanation?

01:22:51.008 --> 01:22:52.342
Walk.

01:22:52.843 --> 01:22:54.385
What the hell did you just tell Garsik?

01:22:54.470 --> 01:22:56.179
-You're unbelievable.
-What's the secret?

01:22:56.263 --> 01:22:58.765
-You screwed her!
-Yeah. For us. For the project.

01:22:58.849 --> 01:23:02.018
-I can't believe you screwed her!
-It was an assignment. It was nothing.

01:23:02.102 --> 01:23:03.436
Well, you should see the pictures.

01:23:03.520 --> 01:23:05.355
Well, you're the last person
I need to explain this to.

01:23:05.439 --> 01:23:07.065
The only difference
between this and our first date

01:23:07.149 --> 01:23:09.359
is that no one was drugged into a coma
and left for dead.

01:23:09.443 --> 01:23:12.153
Left for dead? You were asleep in bed
with a smile on your face!

01:23:12.237 --> 01:23:14.322
-Yeah, for 1 8 bloody hours!
-See, there it is.

01:23:14.406 --> 01:23:16.574
-You can't get past Dubai, can you?
-What's the product, Claire?

01:23:16.659 --> 01:23:18.618
-You say that you can, but you can't.
-What is the product?

01:23:18.702 --> 01:23:22.163
All right, you know what,
I did come back here to clear out my stuff.

01:23:22.247 --> 01:23:24.499
All right, I was gone. I was ready to bail.

01:23:24.583 --> 01:23:27.168
I got the pouch out, I'm halfway there,
and I suddenly realize,

01:23:27.252 --> 01:23:31.506
"Oh, my God! What are you doing?
This is good. This could work. It's payback.

01:23:31.590 --> 01:23:35.176
"We take Dubai, the travel tramp, call it even,
move on, never mention it again."

01:23:35.260 --> 01:23:36.844
So, there I am, I'm loading it all back in,

01:23:36.929 --> 01:23:38.388
I'm putting everything away,
like it never happened,

01:23:38.472 --> 01:23:41.933
and I suddenly realize
there's something missing.

01:23:42.017 --> 01:23:44.352
-Where's Ray's Canadian passport?
-Okay, slow down.

01:23:44.436 --> 01:23:46.354
Which I know for a fact
is supposed to be in there

01:23:46.438 --> 01:23:48.690
because I'm the one
who taped the whole thing together!

01:23:48.774 --> 01:23:51.109
Yes, okay?
Yes, I took the Canadian passport.

01:23:51.193 --> 01:23:53.486
One passport. Why?
Because I was paranoid.

01:23:53.570 --> 01:23:55.822
All this probing and testing
and not trusting me, it gets to you.

01:23:55.906 --> 01:23:57.824
I thought, what's the harm
in having one little parachute

01:23:57.908 --> 01:23:59.075
in case the plane goes down?

01:23:59.159 --> 01:24:01.661
I wanted a hole card. That's it.
That's all it was.

01:24:01.745 --> 01:24:05.498
And the travel lady, did I have to go
that far? Maybe not. But it worked.

01:24:05.582 --> 01:24:09.043
And you know what, that's my cover.
That's always been my cover.

01:24:09.128 --> 01:24:12.714
I'm a mess. I'm a horndog. I'm a slob.
But that's my edge.

01:24:12.798 --> 01:24:14.424
I mean, we're here trying to run a triple game

01:24:14.508 --> 01:24:16.968
on some very smart
and very motivated players.

01:24:17.052 --> 01:24:19.303
What do you want me to do,
play with one hand behind my back?

01:24:19.388 --> 01:24:22.056
It wasn't your hand I was talking about.

01:24:22.141 --> 01:24:24.434
You know what? Get over it.

01:24:24.810 --> 01:24:26.894
You know what? I'm there.

01:24:29.231 --> 01:24:30.398
So what are you saying?

01:24:30.482 --> 01:24:33.568
Same split, new rules.
You keep your parachute. I'll keep mine.

01:24:33.652 --> 01:24:35.820
-You're that jealous?
-No, I'm that focused.

01:24:35.904 --> 01:24:37.655
I've got two years invested in this,

01:24:37.740 --> 01:24:41.576
and the last thing I'm gonna do is let some
stupid, immature personal baggage

01:24:41.660 --> 01:24:44.162
compromise an otherwise
successful operation.

01:24:44.246 --> 01:24:46.247
-So we're strictly business now.
-Deal with it.

01:24:46.331 --> 01:24:48.916
Well, it might help if I knew
what kind of business we were in.

01:24:49.001 --> 01:24:51.878
Hair. They can grow hair.

01:24:52.379 --> 01:24:54.088
Where it belongs.

01:24:55.215 --> 01:24:56.340
You mean what? Like...

01:24:56.425 --> 01:25:00.344
Like, from now on, Ronnie Partiz
will be the patron saint to all bald men.

01:25:00.429 --> 01:25:03.806
-Except there won't be any bald men.
-A cure for baldness?

01:25:03.891 --> 01:25:09.312
Burkett & Randle Wash and Grow Shampoo,
enriched with activated Partizonol.

01:25:11.440 --> 01:25:14.066
-Hair? That's like...
-It's huge.

01:25:14.735 --> 01:25:18.154
Huge? It's beyond huge.
It makes huge look bloody microscopic.

01:25:18.238 --> 01:25:21.991
Do you have any idea what this is worth?
I mean, hair.

01:25:23.952 --> 01:25:27.121
To grow hair, to own that,
that's the all-time Holy Grail.

01:25:27.206 --> 01:25:29.415
No wonder they've been so crazy.

01:25:29.500 --> 01:25:32.084
I mean, we're sitting here
on a cure for baldness

01:25:32.169 --> 01:25:34.879
and you're getting worked up
about some meaningless incident.

01:25:34.963 --> 01:25:39.217
-We don't have it.
-We don't? But it's a formula though, right?

01:25:39.760 --> 01:25:43.221
It has to be. It has to be a formula
with a patent application.

01:25:43.305 --> 01:25:45.848
-So who's got it? Where is it?
-I don't know.

01:25:45.933 --> 01:25:47.642
If you did,
you'd be sharing that, though, right?

01:25:47.726 --> 01:25:51.020
If I were holding out on you,
what would I be doing here now?

01:25:51.104 --> 01:25:52.772
How about pretending
to be pissed off and jealous

01:25:52.898 --> 01:25:54.649
just to keep me from thinking
what was really going on.

01:25:54.733 --> 01:25:56.067
That's sick, even for you.

01:25:56.151 --> 01:25:58.069
Yeah, and that's not the answer
I was looking for.

01:25:58.153 --> 01:25:59.487
Quiet.

01:25:59.571 --> 01:26:00.863
(PHONE RINGING)

01:26:00.948 --> 01:26:02.156
Hello.

01:26:02.407 --> 01:26:04.408
Claire? It's Ned.

01:26:04.952 --> 01:26:08.746
I need you back at the office.
Now. Like immediately.

01:26:10.082 --> 01:26:12.583
I'll be downstairs in 1 0 minutes.

01:26:14.753 --> 01:26:17.088
I have to go. That was Guston.
I have to get back to the office.

01:26:17.172 --> 01:26:19.257
We don't have any partners
I don't know about, do we?

01:26:19.341 --> 01:26:21.509
Yeah, that's what I want. More partners.

01:26:21.593 --> 01:26:24.262
It would be so stupid to burn me now.

01:26:25.681 --> 01:26:27.265
I have to go.

01:26:28.475 --> 01:26:30.810
-We're not gonna talk about this?
-You said it. We're in play.

01:26:30.936 --> 01:26:33.604
-We don't have time.
-Claire...

01:26:44.116 --> 01:26:47.743
PHYSEC 1 : We had a motion detector
go off on 31 , near Mr. Tully's office.

01:26:47.828 --> 01:26:49.453
There's some document rooms up there.

01:26:49.538 --> 01:26:51.414
We found one of the security cages
wide open,

01:26:51.498 --> 01:26:53.124
and we started turning on the lights.

01:26:53.208 --> 01:26:55.334
We heard some scurrying around,
had a little foot race.

01:26:55.460 --> 01:26:57.044
It took a couple minutes,
but we found him down here

01:26:57.129 --> 01:26:58.504
-hiding under the desk.
-Jesus.

01:26:58.630 --> 01:26:59.714
-PHYSEC 1 : We get to running his ID...
-Ned!

01:26:59.798 --> 01:27:02.216
...he starts trying to tell us the whole thing
was some kind of security test.

01:27:02.301 --> 01:27:03.718
Hey, Ned, get these things off me!

01:27:03.802 --> 01:27:06.721
We said, "Hey, that's great,
but we still gotta call your boss."

01:27:06.805 --> 01:27:08.431
That's when he started sweating.

01:27:08.515 --> 01:27:10.808
-Where's the thing?
-PHYSEC 2: Yeah, he had this.

01:27:10.893 --> 01:27:14.645
-"Partizonol 6. 1 ."
-JEFF: Ned, I can explain this!

01:27:14.730 --> 01:27:18.065
NED: Shut up, Jeff. Did you open this?
PHYSEC 1 : No.

01:27:18.150 --> 01:27:21.110
-Did anybody else touch this?
-No, sir, just us and the suspect.

01:27:21.194 --> 01:27:25.823
Suspect? Well, that's no suspect.
You're not a suspect, are you, Jeff?

01:27:25.908 --> 01:27:28.910
You're a backstabbing little weasel,
and you're gonna burn, asshole.

01:27:28.994 --> 01:27:30.786
Okay. Okay, I want a lawyer!

your backstabbing ass out the window!

Is the area upstairs secure now?

01:27:37.419 --> 01:27:39.170
Yeah, are you sure
there's no one else upstairs?

01:27:39.254 --> 01:27:41.213
It's gotta be cleared out before it's re-armed.

01:27:41.340 --> 01:27:44.926
-How long does that take?
-All three floors? 20 minutes.

01:27:45.010 --> 01:27:47.929
Go. Go now. Do it.

01:27:48.597 --> 01:27:51.849
-What about him?
-He's not going anywhere. Go!

01:27:52.559 --> 01:27:54.644
Okay. Back here, 20 minutes.

01:27:54.728 --> 01:27:57.605
Hey, where are you going?
Hey, get back here!

01:27:57.689 --> 01:28:01.108
Don't leave me here with him!
You heard what he said!

01:28:01.193 --> 01:28:04.111
Hey, I mean it! Ned, come on. Claire!

01:28:08.784 --> 01:28:10.660
Okay, you stay here with Jeff.

01:28:10.744 --> 01:28:12.787
I'm gonna run downstairs
and toss his office.

-You don't wanna call it in?
-No.

01:28:14.915 --> 01:28:18.918
All right, we gotta take the lead
so no one else gets involved.

01:28:19.044 --> 01:28:20.878
What about that?

01:28:21.380 --> 01:28:26.926
Leave it. Don't move it. Don't touch it.
Just leave it. All right?

01:28:27.719 --> 01:28:30.721
And relax, okay. I'm gonna call it in.

01:28:31.056 --> 01:28:35.393

01:28:44.903 --> 01:28:48.990
What this does is it returns to man
his original state, his virility.

01:28:49.074 --> 01:28:51.033
-Don't laugh. Excuse me.
-Duke, I think you really...

01:28:51.118 --> 01:28:52.159
Excuse me. Don't laugh.

01:28:52.244 --> 01:28:53.327

-Hey, Ray, so where the hell you been?

leaving the bowling alley.

01:28:58.166 --> 01:29:00.209
Hey, I've been trying to call you, man.
Where's that cell phone?

01:29:00.293 --> 01:29:02.211
-My battery kicked it.
-Do you want to get some pizza?

01:29:02.295 --> 01:29:03.379
-Don't you want anything?
-No, I'm good.

01:29:03.463 --> 01:29:05.381
-All right.
-Cool.

01:29:05.465 --> 01:29:07.591
So what is it, guys?

01:29:07.968 --> 01:29:10.344
-What's the secret?
-The secret?

01:29:12.681 --> 01:29:13.931
Hair.

01:29:18.270 --> 01:29:22.773
All right, listen to me, Claire. Forget Ned.
Okay? Forget Tully.

01:29:22.858 --> 01:29:26.777
Do you have any idea what this is worth?
They can grow hair!

01:29:26.903 --> 01:29:29.030
Okay? They can restore hair.

01:29:29.114 --> 01:29:31.365
Do you have any idea
what we could sell this for?

01:29:31.450 --> 01:29:33.451
What Garsik would pay for this?

01:29:33.535 --> 01:29:36.704
They haven't delivered the patent yet, Claire.
It's an open technology.

01:29:36.788 --> 01:29:39.957
Now, there it is. I can see it. It's a fortune.
It's just... All right.

01:29:40.042 --> 01:29:44.295
Claire! All right, just wait. Wait.
Claire, listen. Listen to me.

01:29:45.380 --> 01:29:48.215
There's always been a spark between us.
You know that!

01:29:48.300 --> 01:29:50.885

01:53:19.626 --> 01:53:21.878
and when I think about Rome,
I think about you and...

01:53:21.962 --> 01:53:23.045
Let's just do it one more time.

01:53:23.130 --> 01:53:26.549
CLAIRE: ...when I think about you,
I can barely enunciate.

01:53:27.718 --> 01:53:31.095
-One more time without the robe.
-RAY: I don't work naked.

01:53:31.722 --> 01:53:33.931
CLAIRE: You know I know it.
RAY: So show me.

01:53:34.016 --> 01:53:35.641
CLAIRE: You show me.

01:53:35.767 --> 01:53:38.436
RAY: (CHUCKLES) Look,
let's just do it all the way through.

01:53:38.520 --> 01:53:41.689
RAY OVER SPEAKER: From the top,
one more time, and then l'll take off the robe.

01:53:41.773 --> 01:53:45.193
CLAlRE: lf you love me,
you'II do it without the robe, now.

01:53:46.778 --> 01:53:49.822
RAY: Okay. From the top. No robe.

01:53:51.617 --> 01:53:52.742
RAY: Remember me?

01:53:52.826 --> 01:53:56.329
CLAlRE: Sure. Of course. We...
RAY: Long time, huh?

01:53:56.413 --> 01:53:59.123
CLAlRE: Yes. l'm...
RAY: Gotcha.

01:54:00.959 --> 01:54:05.505
CLAlRE: Look, l'm sorry. Really, l just...
RAY: Sorry. Sorry.

01:54:06.840 --> 01:54:09.050
CLAlRE: (LAUGHS)
I'm just drawing a bIank here.

01:54:10.135 --> 01:54:11.886
RAY: You're drawing what?

01:54:14.473 --> 01:54:15.806
CLAlRE: Excuse me?

01:54:18.894 --> 01:54:21.020
Perfect. They're perfect!

01:54:21.647 --> 01:54:23.564
Does that mean we're a go, sir?

01:54:23.649 --> 01:54:26.359
Or we could spend another year
looking for ways to bait this trap,

01:54:26.443 --> 01:54:29.070
and we wouldn't come up
with anything even close.

01:54:29.154 --> 01:54:32.323
They're perfect. What a way to walk this in.

01:54:32.658 --> 01:54:35.785
I'm only asking.
We made sure she found the speech.

01:54:36.161 --> 01:54:39.455
JEFF: The rough draft.
We let her find it this afternoon.

01:54:40.749 --> 01:54:43.709
But we could still stall a little bit
if we need to tighten things up.

01:54:43.794 --> 01:54:45.378
Once it's activated, Howard, we're in.

01:54:45.462 --> 01:54:47.255
It's gonna be impossible
to call back the troops.

01:54:47.339 --> 01:54:50.216
No. No, no, no, no.
We're not stalling anymore.

01:54:50.300 --> 01:54:52.969
-So is this everything?
-Yes, sir.

01:54:53.053 --> 01:54:56.806
So the speech... Here is your final copy.

01:54:57.474 --> 01:55:00.017
HOWARD: ...the details,
the very existence of this project

01:55:00.102 --> 01:55:02.228
must be so carefuIIy protected.

01:55:02.312 --> 01:55:04.480
The rough draft that we prepped
with you last week is in play.

01:55:04.648 --> 01:55:06.315
DALE: This is starting to Iook pretty good.

01:55:06.400 --> 01:55:08.568
DUKE: I can't even teII them apart.
Which one is the new one?

01:55:08.652 --> 01:55:10.903
PAM: For the travel records,
the Dunwoody material,

01:55:10.988 --> 01:55:14.865
we've logged
about 200 false-flag travel orders.

01:55:15.325 --> 01:55:18.452
Formavale? Damned if l know.
Some kind of biotech.

01:55:18.912 --> 01:55:23.833
PAM: Cars, planes, hotels, everything.
Then we buried them in the actual files.

01:55:24.167 --> 01:55:27.044
-And when they start digging?
-They find Ronnie.

01:55:27.129 --> 01:55:29.714
Yes. And there's a plane waiting
to take me back to the Bahamas

01:55:29.798 --> 01:55:30.965
once we're done here tonight.

01:55:33.260 --> 01:55:34.302
(SIGHS)

01:55:34.386 --> 01:55:36.304
RONNIE: This is my high school yearbook.

01:55:37.180 --> 01:55:38.973
And the transcripts.

01:55:39.057 --> 01:55:40.558
RlCHARD: You gotta stop waltzing around,

01:55:40.642 --> 01:55:42.768
and you have got to get on this guy.

01:55:42.853 --> 01:55:45.605
So we take Ronnie's reality
until two years ago

01:55:45.689 --> 01:55:47.231
and we lay in our story on top.

01:55:47.316 --> 01:55:48.482
PHYSEC 1 : We started turning on the lights.

01:55:48.567 --> 01:55:50.735
We heard some scurrying around,
we had a little foot race.

01:55:50.819 --> 01:55:52.486
It took a coupIe of minutes,
but we found him down here

01:55:52.571 --> 01:55:53.613
hiding under the desk.

01:55:53.947 --> 01:55:55.031
The trips to Dunwoody,

01:55:55.115 --> 01:55:57.617
the background
on the Formavale acquisitions,

01:55:57.701 --> 01:56:01.287
the midnight load-outs,
it's all in place and ready to go.

01:56:02.789 --> 01:56:06.334
Great work. Inspiring. Incredible.

01:56:08.337 --> 01:56:11.172
This is more fun than if we really had it.

01:56:11.590 --> 01:56:14.300
Ten days, that's the deadline.

01:56:14.384 --> 01:56:17.345
Garsik has his shareholder meeting
in 1 0 days.

01:56:18.347 --> 01:56:21.057
Light the fuse. Put it in play.

01:56:28.482 --> 01:56:31.192
CLAIRE: Don't.
RAY: Don't what?

01:56:31.777 --> 01:56:34.695
CLAIRE: Don't say it.
RAY: Say what?

01:56:35.364 --> 01:56:37.573
CLAIRE: I know what you're thinking.

01:56:37.658 --> 01:56:40.701
You're wondering
if I gave you a bogus formula.

01:56:41.203 --> 01:56:45.331
You're thinking maybe I've got the real one
stashed someplace else.

01:56:45.415 --> 01:56:48.125
That's sick, even for you.

01:56:48.960 --> 01:56:50.961
But it crossed your mind.

01:56:51.546 --> 01:56:55.549
-That's why I get the big bucks.
-Because I would never do that.

01:56:56.968 --> 01:57:00.554
-Because you love me.
-Exactly.

01:57:06.603 --> 01:57:10.314
Mr. Koval and Miss Stenwick?

01:57:22.452 --> 01:57:30.501
Read it.

01:57:31.795 --> 01:57:34.004
RAY: "Compliments of Howard Tully."

01:58:16.047 --> 01:58:20.634
-We got totally played, didn't we?
-Yep.

01:58:22.429 --> 01:58:25.097
Must go pretty far back.

01:58:26.725 --> 01:58:28.434
-Like...
-Way back.

01:58:32.272 --> 01:58:34.815
I guess on a strictly professional level, it's...

01:58:34.900 --> 01:58:36.275
Impressive.

01:58:36.985 --> 01:58:38.611
-I mean...
-Yeah.

01:58:49.414 --> 01:58:51.540
At least we have each other.

01:58:52.209 --> 01:58:55.878
-It really is that bad, isn't it?
-Kind of, yeah.

01:58:56.254 --> 01:58:58.297
-I didn't mean...
-I know.

01:59:02.344 --> 01:59:05.513
-I can't breathe.
-You'll be okay.

01:59:06.473 --> 01:59:10.518
-When?
-After we wake up in Rome.

01:59:13.063 --> 01:59:17.316
CLAIRE: I might have to wake up in Rome
for a long time.

01:59:19.569 --> 01:59:21.278
RAY: Sounds like a plan.

01:59:39.756 --> 01:59:43.425
-CROWD: Dick! Dick! Dick! Dick!
-Dick! Dick! Dick! Dick!

01:59:44.177 --> 01:59:48.430
-Dick! Dick! Dick! Dick!
-Dick! Dick! Dick! Dick!

01:59:51.226 --> 01:59:54.728
I won't begin to understand

01:59:54.813 --> 01:59:58.232
How I just found the perfect man

01:59:58.316 --> 02:00:00.985
Where have you been hiding out?

02:00:01.069 --> 02:00:03.320
You're deadIy

02:00:05.574 --> 02:00:08.909
You turn me on
You spun me out

02:00:08.994 --> 02:00:12.913
You know just what I'm aII about

02:00:12.998 --> 02:00:17.376
I've got my eyes aII over you
You're tricky

02:00:19.671 --> 02:00:22.756
Now l see

02:00:22.841 --> 02:00:29.763
How life could be
A scent so sweet

02:00:30.265 --> 02:00:34.268
You've got me faIIing

A perfect match
A naughty game

02:01:06.134 --> 02:01:10.137
Please, l never want

02:01:10.221 --> 02:01:17.061
A perfect sin you've got me in

02:01:17.145 --> 02:01:23.400
Now l see how life could be

02:01:23.485 --> 02:01:27.613
