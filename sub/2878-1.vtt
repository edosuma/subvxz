<i>Previously</i>
<i>on</i> The Big Bang Theory...

00:02.029 --> 00:05.031
My brother-- he's got
a big crush on Bernadette.

00:06.471 --> 00:09.505
You're moving
back to India?

00:15.762 --> 00:17.096
What's going on?

00:18.549 --> 00:21.434
It's-It's not
what it looks like.

00:24.555 --> 00:27.073
What does it look like?

00:29.076 --> 00:32.778
It's not what it looks like.

00:33.630 --> 00:37.617
It's not what it looks like.

00:37.619 --> 00:39.285
What are you grinding about?

00:39.287 --> 00:42.505
Penny's brain teaser
this morning.

00:42.507 --> 00:44.123
She and Koothrappali

00:44.125 --> 00:46.342
emerge from your bedroom.

00:46.344 --> 00:49.879
She is disheveled, and Raj
is dressed only in a sheet.

00:49.881 --> 00:55.101
The sole clue:
"It's not what it looks like."

00:55.103 --> 00:57.803
Just let it go, Sheldon.

00:57.805 --> 01:01.607
If I could, I would,
but I can't, so I shan't.

01:01.609 --> 01:03.809
Now, knowing Penny,

01:03.811 --> 01:06.979
the obvious answer is,
they engaged in coitus.

01:06.981 --> 01:08.531
But...

01:08.533 --> 01:10.266
since that's
what it looked like,

01:10.268 --> 01:13.519
we can rule that out.

01:13.521 --> 01:14.620
Let's put on

01:14.622 --> 01:17.623
our thinking cap, shall we?

01:21.778 --> 01:25.047
Raj is from India,
a tropical country.

01:25.049 --> 01:26.749
Third World hygiene.

01:26.751 --> 01:30.119
Parasitic infections are common,
such as pinworms.

01:30.121 --> 01:31.721
Mm-hmm.
The procedure

01:31.723 --> 01:33.472
for diagnosing pinworms
is to wait

01:33.474 --> 01:35.341
until the subject is asleep,

01:35.343 --> 01:37.944
and the worms crawl out
of the rectum for air.

01:43.967 --> 01:46.269
Yes, just like that.

01:47.454 --> 01:49.238
Penny could have been

01:49.240 --> 01:51.741
inspecting Raj's anal region
for parasites.

01:51.743 --> 01:53.276
Oh, boy.

01:53.278 --> 01:55.328
That's a true blue friend.

01:55.330 --> 01:59.332
They slept together, Sherlock.

01:59.334 --> 02:01.367
No, you weren't listening.

02:01.369 --> 02:04.787
She said
it's <i>not</i> what it looks like.

02:04.789 --> 02:07.206
She lied.

02:10.077 --> 02:12.295
Oh.

02:13.463 --> 02:16.849
Don't I look silly

02:52.000 --> 02:53.000
Hey.

02:53.002 --> 02:53.834
Hey.

02:53.836 --> 02:55.836
Hey.

02:57.301 --> 02:59.770
Hey.

03:06.415 --> 03:08.366
Leonard, is it awkward for you

03:08.368 --> 03:11.202
knowing that one of your dear
friends had sexual intercourse

03:11.204 --> 03:13.070
with a woman you used to love

03:13.072 --> 03:15.706
in the very place
you lay your head?

03:17.793 --> 03:19.894
No, I'm fine with it.

03:19.896 --> 03:22.046
That sounds like sarcasm,

03:22.048 --> 03:24.081
but I'm going to disregard it,

03:24.083 --> 03:26.801
because I have an agenda--
paintball.

03:26.803 --> 03:28.252
Specifically,
the interdepartmental

03:28.254 --> 03:29.687
tournament this weekend.

03:29.689 --> 03:32.756
In order to function better
as a fighting unit,

03:32.758 --> 03:35.592
I thought we should establish
a chain of command.

03:35.594 --> 03:37.061
Now, it goes
without saying

03:37.063 --> 03:39.013
that I would outrank
the three of you,

03:39.015 --> 03:41.983
but the question remains,
by how much?

03:41.985 --> 03:43.234
Now,

03:43.236 --> 03:45.870
I don't see me
as some four-star general,

03:45.872 --> 03:47.788
back at HQ riding a desk

03:47.790 --> 03:49.907
and playing golf
with the Secretary of Defense.

03:49.909 --> 03:51.959
But I also can't be
Sergeant Cooper,

03:51.961 --> 03:53.377
because that might lead you

03:53.379 --> 03:55.746
to think of me
as just a regular Joe.

03:55.748 --> 03:58.282
This might take some thought.
As you were.

03:58.284 --> 04:00.051
What the hell is wrong with you?

04:00.053 --> 04:01.719
Yeah, how could
you do that?

04:01.721 --> 04:04.255
- What is it to you?
- I got his back.

04:04.257 --> 04:06.123
Yeah, right. You're just jealous
because it turns out

04:06.125 --> 04:07.624
I'm Penny's
number two choice after Leonard.

04:07.626 --> 04:11.479
Hey, if I wasn't engaged
to Bernadette,

04:11.481 --> 04:13.097
that totally could have been me.

04:14.016 --> 04:16.100
Please. Sheldon would have been
before you,

04:16.101 --> 04:19.153
and he might not even
have genitals!

04:19.154 --> 04:20.521
Why do you care so much?

04:20.523 --> 04:21.805
You're dating my sister,

04:21.808 --> 04:23.574
and Penny and I are in love.

04:23.576 --> 04:24.909
What?!

04:24.911 --> 04:28.162
Gentlemen,
if I may interject,

04:28.164 --> 04:30.481
I've decided my rank
will be captain.

04:30.483 --> 04:33.334
If it's good enough for
Kirk, Crunch and Kangaroo,

04:33.336 --> 04:35.503
it's good enough for me.

04:35.505 --> 04:37.738
You're not in love with Penny.

04:37.740 --> 04:39.123
Yes, I am.

04:39.125 --> 04:43.044
The god Kamadeva has shot us
with his flowery arrows of love.

04:43.046 --> 04:44.178
Who?

04:44.180 --> 04:45.563
He's the Hindu version of Cupid,

04:45.565 --> 04:49.016
but way better,
because he rides a giant parrot.

04:49.018 --> 04:53.104
Raj, come on. You fall in love
with any girl who smiles at you.

04:53.106 --> 04:56.357
A month ago, you were writing
poems about his fiancée.

04:57.342 --> 04:59.443
I'm sorry. What?!

04:59.445 --> 05:02.480
Rubbish. He's talking rubbish.

05:02.482 --> 05:05.682
"Oh, Bernadette,
please play my clarinet."

05:07.018 --> 05:10.371
That could have been
about anyone.

05:11.289 --> 05:12.689
Besides, you have nothing
to worry about,

05:12.691 --> 05:16.527
because now I'm the dusky half
of Koothrapenny.

05:17.329 --> 05:19.630
For the record,
I do have genitals.

05:20.865 --> 05:23.784
They're functional
and aesthetically pleasing.

05:34.763 --> 05:37.047
Well.

05:39.268 --> 05:41.635
Oh. Coming.

05:41.637 --> 05:43.137
Yup, that's good.

05:43.139 --> 05:45.489
Wine glasses
<i>should</i> have handles.

05:47.242 --> 05:50.277
Keeping accurate track
of your alcohol intake.

05:50.279 --> 05:52.530
Smart idea considering
how trampy you get

05:52.532 --> 05:54.231
when you've had a few.

05:54.233 --> 05:56.016
You heard what I did?

05:56.018 --> 05:57.752
Well, I heard <i>who</i> you did.

05:59.005 --> 06:01.705
Oh, my God,

06:01.707 --> 06:03.407
I screwed up everything.

06:03.409 --> 06:05.009
I hurt Leonard.

06:05.011 --> 06:06.210
I hurt Raj.

06:06.212 --> 06:08.012
I mean, what is wrong with me?

06:08.014 --> 06:10.080
I feel like
two totally different people--

06:10.082 --> 06:13.300
Dr. Jekyll and Mrs. Whore.

06:13.302 --> 06:15.636
Don't be so hard on yourself.

06:15.638 --> 06:18.472
Do you know the story
of Catherine the Great?

06:18.474 --> 06:19.440
No.

06:19.442 --> 06:20.757
She ruled Russia

06:20.759 --> 06:22.443
in the late 1700s,
and one night,

06:22.445 --> 06:24.261
when she was feeling
particularly randy,

06:24.263 --> 06:26.113
she used an intricate
system of pulleys

06:26.115 --> 06:29.083
to have intimate
relations with a horse.

06:29.085 --> 06:31.652
I'm... I'm sorry.

06:31.654 --> 06:33.370
What does this have
to do with me?

06:33.372 --> 06:36.407
She engaged in
interspecies hanky-panky,

06:36.409 --> 06:38.959
and people still
call her "Great."

06:38.961 --> 06:40.444
I'm sure your
reputation can survive

06:40.446 --> 06:42.963
you shagging a
little Indian boy.

06:52.174 --> 06:54.091
You jerk face!

06:55.427 --> 06:56.577
What did you tell Howard?!

06:56.579 --> 06:58.846
Did you say there was something
going on between us?

06:58.848 --> 07:00.047
Because he thinks there is!

07:00.049 --> 07:02.516
He's completely freaking out!

07:02.518 --> 07:05.269
Please, come in.

07:05.271 --> 07:07.638
- What the hell is wrong with you?!
- Well...

07:07.640 --> 07:10.741
You were always so nice to me,
I thought maybe you liked me.

07:10.743 --> 07:14.512
I'm nice to everyone!

07:14.514 --> 07:16.413
I'm sorry.

07:16.415 --> 07:18.365
Damn right, you're sorry!

07:18.367 --> 07:21.952
And you tell Howard there's
never been anything between us!

07:21.954 --> 07:24.922
- I will. Hey, Bernadette?
- What?!

07:24.924 --> 07:27.007
Do you think
I have a shot with Penny?

07:27.009 --> 07:29.159
Of course you do.
You're a cutie pie!

07:29.161 --> 07:32.162
Any girl would be lucky
to have you!

07:35.333 --> 07:37.501
You know, I've
done this before.

07:37.503 --> 07:39.019
In kindergarten,

07:39.021 --> 07:40.971
I was supposed to marry
Jason Sorensen at recess,

07:40.973 --> 07:42.773
but by the time
my class got out there,

07:42.775 --> 07:45.059
he was already engaged
to Chelsea Himmelfarb.

07:46.194 --> 07:47.344
So what did I do?

07:47.346 --> 07:48.979
Hung upside down
from the monkey bars,

07:48.981 --> 07:52.449
let all the boys see
my underpants.

07:52.451 --> 07:53.734
You can't blame yourself.

07:53.736 --> 07:56.353
When your prefrontal cortex
fails to make you happy,

07:56.355 --> 07:59.022
promiscuity rewards you with
the needed flood of dopamine.

07:59.024 --> 08:03.527
We neurobiologists refer
to this as the "skank reflex."

08:03.529 --> 08:04.962
You know what?

08:04.964 --> 08:06.547
Let's get out of here.

08:06.549 --> 08:07.831
Where are we going?

08:07.833 --> 08:09.700
Somewhere where no
one's seen me naked.

08:09.702 --> 08:11.552
We may have to
drive awhile.

08:19.261 --> 08:22.680
Subtlety isn't
her strong suit, is it?

08:22.682 --> 08:25.015
Can I stay at your
place for a few nights?

08:25.017 --> 08:26.150
Really?

08:26.152 --> 08:29.339
A best friend sleepover? Yay.

08:30.573 --> 08:32.740
Yeah, sure. Yay!

08:32.741 --> 08:34.607
We'll make popcorn,
stay up all night

08:34.610 --> 08:37.578
and I'll teach you
my secret language, Op.

08:37.580 --> 08:39.663
- Sounds great.
- Nope.

08:39.664 --> 08:42.666
Sounds "Gop Rop E A Top."

08:42.668 --> 08:45.536
- Yeah, I'm gonna go pack a bag.
- No, you're not.

08:45.538 --> 08:50.174
You're gonna
"Pop A Cop Kop A Bop A Gop."

08:55.764 --> 08:58.215
Do we really have
to wear this camouflage crap

08:58.217 --> 09:00.267
to play paintball?

09:00.269 --> 09:01.552
Who said that?

09:01.554 --> 09:03.771
Leonard, I can
hear your voice,

09:03.773 --> 09:05.723
but I can't see you.

09:05.725 --> 09:09.276
I'm not in the mood, Sheldon.

09:09.278 --> 09:11.145
Oh, there you are!

09:11.147 --> 09:13.096
Leonard,

09:13.098 --> 09:16.450
I know you're upset
about recent events, and

09:16.452 --> 09:17.952
I have someone
here to help.

09:17.954 --> 09:19.620
I don't want
to talk to Amy.

09:19.622 --> 09:22.606
No, it's not Amy.

09:22.608 --> 09:24.575
Hello, dear.

09:24.577 --> 09:26.577
You called my mother?

09:26.579 --> 09:27.795
Oh, Leonard,

09:27.797 --> 09:30.748
is it really necessary
to caption the obvious?

09:30.750 --> 09:34.068
He's been like that
since he was a toddler.

09:34.070 --> 09:36.053
"Look, Mommy-- a butterfly."

09:36.055 --> 09:38.439
Maddening.

09:39.791 --> 09:41.558
What's going on?
What do you want?

09:41.560 --> 09:42.843
Sheldon informed me

09:42.845 --> 09:45.062
that you're experiencing
an emotional upheaval,

09:45.064 --> 09:46.497
and I'm here to help.

09:46.499 --> 09:48.999
That's so nice.

09:49.001 --> 09:51.452
And we're back to the obvious.

09:52.654 --> 09:54.188
Now, what's up?

09:54.190 --> 09:57.691
Well, uh... okay.

09:57.693 --> 09:59.743
Um...

09:59.745 --> 10:01.996
I don't want to get
back together with Penny.

10:01.998 --> 10:05.282
We tried it, it was crazy,
it didn't work,

10:05.284 --> 10:06.784
but I can't deal with the fact

10:06.786 --> 10:08.869
that she slept
with my friend Raj.

10:08.871 --> 10:11.154
And then I find out
that Raj's sister Priya,

10:11.156 --> 10:13.624
who I've been going out with
for eight months,

10:13.626 --> 10:15.092
is moving back to India.

10:15.094 --> 10:18.495
So I'm just completely confused
and alone.

10:18.497 --> 10:20.014
I understand.

10:20.016 --> 10:21.665
Got any advice?

10:21.667 --> 10:23.851
Yes. Buck up.

10:25.270 --> 10:26.970
Excuse me.

10:26.972 --> 10:28.555
You're a world-renowned expert

10:28.557 --> 10:30.307
in parenting
and child development,

10:30.309 --> 10:32.342
and all you've got is "Buck up"?

10:32.344 --> 10:34.144
Sorry.

10:34.146 --> 10:35.863
Buck up, sissy pants.

10:37.532 --> 10:39.316
Thanks, Mother.
I feel much better.

10:39.318 --> 10:41.285
If you need any more help
from me,

10:41.287 --> 10:43.704
my books are available
on Amazon.

10:43.706 --> 10:45.906
Logging off.

10:50.649 --> 10:55.302
...ninety-nine,
one hundred.

10:55.303 --> 10:59.522
It's like a waterfall
of liquid gold.

10:59.524 --> 11:00.957
My turn.

11:05.863 --> 11:08.181
You know,
I don't even know what the point

11:08.183 --> 11:09.616
of me staying in L.A. is.

11:09.618 --> 11:12.369
I haven't gotten a single acting
job since I moved out here.

11:12.371 --> 11:14.320
The closest I came
was last month,

11:14.322 --> 11:16.856
I got a callback
for a hemorrhoid commercial.

11:16.858 --> 11:21.111
Oh, I could so see you being
the face of hemorrhoids.

11:21.113 --> 11:23.830
I know, right?

11:24.866 --> 11:27.033
Maybe I should just
move back to Nebraska.

11:27.035 --> 11:29.135
No, I can't let
you do that.

11:29.137 --> 11:30.203
Why not?

11:31.206 --> 11:32.655
For the first
time ever,

11:32.657 --> 11:34.090
I have a thriving
social life.

11:34.092 --> 11:35.058
And no pressure,

11:35.060 --> 11:38.311
but it kind of
lives and dies with you.

11:40.214 --> 11:41.214
Hi, Amy.

11:41.216 --> 11:42.432
Can I talk to Penny?

11:42.434 --> 11:44.851
A guest in my trundle bed
and a boy at my door?

11:44.853 --> 11:49.355
I wish I could tell 13-year-old
me "it does get better."

11:49.357 --> 11:51.274
How did you know I was here?

11:51.276 --> 11:53.559
It's all over her
Facebook page.

11:57.397 --> 11:58.948
I'll take your stuff
to the bedroom

11:58.950 --> 12:00.583
and clear out a drawer.
Thanks.

12:00.585 --> 12:03.503
No problem. Try and keep it
in your pants, okay?

12:06.590 --> 12:08.407
So, hi.

12:08.409 --> 12:09.509
What's up?

12:09.511 --> 12:11.594
I was wondering if
you're free Friday.

12:11.596 --> 12:13.680
They're having a Totally
'80s Night at the Greek.

12:13.682 --> 12:15.515
Hall & Oates,
Katrina and the Waves

12:15.517 --> 12:17.684
and three-fifths of Kajagoogoo.

12:17.686 --> 12:19.552
Oh.

12:19.554 --> 12:21.604
Gee, that's really sweet,
but the thing is...

12:21.606 --> 12:23.590
Aw, there's a thing.

12:23.592 --> 12:25.725
Look, honey, I was really drunk

12:25.727 --> 12:27.444
and made a huge mistake
last night.

12:27.446 --> 12:29.112
We should've never
slept together.

12:29.114 --> 12:30.897
It's what ruins friendships.

12:30.899 --> 12:33.149
You can't ruin a friendship
with sex.

12:33.151 --> 12:37.170
That's like trying to ruin ice
cream with chocolate sprinkles.

12:38.706 --> 12:39.706
Come here.

12:39.708 --> 12:42.041
Just listen to me.

12:42.043 --> 12:44.661
I want to go back
to the way we were before.

12:44.663 --> 12:46.329
You know, friends.

12:46.331 --> 12:48.465
No sprinkles.

12:50.334 --> 12:53.036
Oh.

12:53.038 --> 12:54.137
All right.

12:54.139 --> 12:56.506
Thank you.

12:58.626 --> 13:00.593
Well, uh...

13:00.595 --> 13:05.482
as your friend, you might
like to know that, um...

13:09.236 --> 13:14.190
we didn't have sex in
the conventional sense.

13:17.628 --> 13:19.662
Oh, God.

13:19.664 --> 13:23.082
Did you pull some weird
Indian crap on me?

13:23.084 --> 13:25.585
No, no.

13:27.154 --> 13:29.822
After we got undressed
and jumped in bed,

13:29.824 --> 13:32.375
you-you asked if
I had protection.

13:32.377 --> 13:33.760
Oh, you did, didn't you?

13:33.762 --> 13:35.678
Of course. I'm
always packing.

13:35.680 --> 13:37.714
Anyway,

13:37.716 --> 13:40.666
um, I had trouble
putting it on

13:40.668 --> 13:43.937
and you tried
to help and...

13:47.391 --> 13:49.792
that was all
she wrote.

13:54.665 --> 13:56.482
So, we didn't actually...

13:56.484 --> 13:57.483
I did.

13:57.485 --> 13:59.502
It was beautiful.

14:03.523 --> 14:04.741
Oh!

14:04.743 --> 14:06.192
Penny, please,
please promise me

14:06.194 --> 14:07.660
you won't tell
anybody about this.

14:07.662 --> 14:09.195
Of course I won't.
No, I won't.

14:09.197 --> 14:11.164
Oh, good.

14:11.166 --> 14:12.932
Um, can I tell
people that our love

14:12.934 --> 14:14.217
burned too bright
and too quickly?

14:14.219 --> 14:17.036
Kind of a "Candle
in the Wind" deal?

14:17.038 --> 14:18.087
Sure.

14:18.089 --> 14:19.806
Cool. Can I say
it fell apart

14:19.808 --> 14:21.874
because you were all, "I
want to have your babies""

14:21.876 --> 14:25.028
and I was like, "I'm too rock
and roll to be tied down"?

14:26.547 --> 14:27.597
No.

14:27.599 --> 14:31.568
Can I say I ruined
you for white men?

14:33.404 --> 14:36.189
Also no.

14:36.191 --> 14:37.407
Okay, just the
candle thing.

14:37.409 --> 14:39.558
Yeah.

14:39.560 --> 14:41.277
Cool.

14:41.279 --> 14:43.413
All right... friend.

14:43.415 --> 14:44.614
Hmm.

14:44.616 --> 14:46.899
I'll see you around.

14:46.901 --> 14:47.784
Okay.

14:50.237 --> 14:51.721
Raj, wait.

14:55.742 --> 14:58.878
Thank you for being my friend.

14:58.880 --> 15:00.746
Penny?

15:00.748 --> 15:01.931
Mm-hmm?

15:01.933 --> 15:03.383
It's getting
beautiful again.

15:07.087 --> 15:09.555
All right, this is
a Google Earth view

15:09.557 --> 15:11.441
of the field
of battle.

15:11.443 --> 15:12.692
I don't see anything.

15:12.694 --> 15:14.811
Give it a
second to load.

15:14.813 --> 15:16.595
Whenever you're
ready, AT&T!

15:16.597 --> 15:19.449
Okay, here we go.

15:19.451 --> 15:22.035
This is us here.
To the south is Professor Loomis

15:22.037 --> 15:23.403
and the Geology Department.

15:23.405 --> 15:26.239
According to their Twitter feed,
they're out of sunblock,

15:26.241 --> 15:30.660
which means they'll have to hug
the tree line or risk melanoma.

15:31.378 --> 15:32.629
That's our edge.

15:32.631 --> 15:35.281
All we have to do is move
quickly over this ridge,

15:35.283 --> 15:36.666
the rock-worshipping
pasty-faced bastards

15:36.668 --> 15:37.950
won't know what hit them!

15:37.952 --> 15:40.136
All right, let's move out.

15:40.971 --> 15:43.056
Hang on, Sheldon.

15:43.058 --> 15:46.926
How could you not tell me your
sister was moving back to India?

15:46.928 --> 15:49.345
Maybe he was too busy
writing clumsy penis metaphors

15:49.347 --> 15:51.347
about my fiancée.

15:51.349 --> 15:52.482
Screw you.

15:52.484 --> 15:55.618
That was a beautifully written
penis metaphor.

15:58.656 --> 16:01.524
You know what, guys, I'm not
in the mood for paintball.

16:01.526 --> 16:03.326
What do you say
we just bag it?

16:03.328 --> 16:05.078
- Fine with me.
- Sure, whatever.

16:05.080 --> 16:06.479
You can't quit.

16:06.481 --> 16:08.231
That's a court-
martial offense.

16:08.233 --> 16:10.700
That's punishable by...

16:10.702 --> 16:12.618
You can't quit.

16:12.620 --> 16:16.339
Sorry, Sheldon, it's just not
a good time for playing games.

16:16.341 --> 16:18.657
This is a game to you?

16:18.659 --> 16:21.928
Uh, was the Battle of Antietam
a game?

16:21.930 --> 16:25.048
Huh? Was the sack
of Rome a game?

16:25.050 --> 16:28.667
Yes, no and no.

16:28.669 --> 16:29.969
Wait.

16:31.055 --> 16:34.774
I just want you all to know
that I forgive you.

16:34.776 --> 16:37.393
This mutiny
isn't your fault,

16:37.395 --> 16:39.345
it's mine.

16:39.347 --> 16:41.531
I haven't earned these bars.

16:48.355 --> 16:49.906
Although what I lack
in leadership,

16:49.908 --> 16:53.326
apparently I more than
make up for in sewing.

16:53.328 --> 16:55.361
Let it go, Sheldon.

16:55.363 --> 16:57.714
I'll get you a Jamba Juice
on the way home.

16:57.716 --> 16:58.715
No.

16:58.717 --> 17:02.051
Jamba Juice is for heroes.

17:04.088 --> 17:06.372
And that's what
we're going to be.

17:08.092 --> 17:09.425
What are you doing?

17:09.426 --> 17:14.713
Following in the footsteps
of Kirk, Crunch and Kangaroo.

17:27.243 --> 17:31.280
Geology isn't a real science!

17:47.914 --> 17:51.384
Damn those sons
of bitches!

17:51.386 --> 17:52.935
Let's get 'em!

17:52.937 --> 17:54.753
Eat paint!

17:59.926 --> 18:01.944
If there's ever
a Church of Sheldon,

18:01.946 --> 18:04.597
this will be when it started.

18:05.567 --> 18:08.251
Ow!

18:09.369 --> 18:11.103
I'd like to
propose a toast

18:11.105 --> 18:14.707
to the man whose noble
sacrifice inspired our victory,

18:14.709 --> 18:16.459
Captain Sheldon Cooper.

18:16.461 --> 18:17.994
Hear, hear.
Hear, hear.

18:17.996 --> 18:20.830
Excuse me.
It's <i>Major</i> Sheldon Cooper.

18:21.498 --> 18:22.948
With my last breath,

18:22.950 --> 18:26.252
I awarded myself
a battlefield promotion.

18:26.854 --> 18:28.387
It's kind of a big deal.

18:30.175 --> 18:33.142
Hi. You guys have a minute?

18:34.728 --> 18:36.962
Uh, yeah, sure.

18:36.964 --> 18:38.598
Okay.

18:38.600 --> 18:40.233
Um...

18:40.235 --> 18:42.735
Well, I already talked to Raj,
but I wanted to apologize

18:42.737 --> 18:44.020
to the rest of you for,

18:44.022 --> 18:46.906
you know, everything.

18:46.908 --> 18:48.574
Please, Penny, let me.

18:48.576 --> 18:53.362
We've decided to let our crazy,
wonderful night together

18:53.364 --> 18:56.082
be just one of those
memories you have

18:56.084 --> 18:58.201
and can call to mind
when you're feeling blue

18:58.203 --> 19:00.303
or you're in the shower.

19:02.155 --> 19:04.340
Hey, what you doing,
Quick Draw?

19:10.180 --> 19:11.714
Sorry. Go on.

19:13.351 --> 19:16.135
Anyways, I wanted you guys all
to know that I've been taking

19:16.137 --> 19:19.105
a really hard look at things
and come to the conclusion

19:19.107 --> 19:21.023
I have to stop kidding myself.

19:21.025 --> 19:23.109
I suck at acting.

19:23.111 --> 19:25.778
It's time for me
to move back to Nebraska.

19:25.780 --> 19:27.680
You're leaving?

19:27.682 --> 19:28.981
Yeah.

19:28.983 --> 19:30.950
What are you
going to do in Nebraska?

19:30.952 --> 19:33.819
I don't know,
maybe teach acting.

19:34.873 --> 19:36.789
Oh, sorry. Hold on.

19:36.791 --> 19:38.241
Hello?

19:38.243 --> 19:41.026
Penny, listen, I hope you're not
doing this 'cause of you and me,

19:41.028 --> 19:43.362
because I have a girlfriend,
and you're a single woman...

19:43.364 --> 19:44.530
Shh! It's my agent,
it's my agent.

19:44.532 --> 19:45.831
You're kidding.

19:45.833 --> 19:46.799
Oh, my gosh.

19:46.801 --> 19:48.634
I can't believe it!
Really?!

19:48.636 --> 19:49.702
Oh, I'm so excited!

19:49.704 --> 19:50.670
Thank you!

19:50.672 --> 19:51.888
Thank you so much.

19:51.890 --> 19:53.172
Okay, bye.

19:53.174 --> 19:54.674
I got the hemorrhoid commercial!

19:54.676 --> 19:55.858
I start Monday!

19:57.895 --> 19:59.595
What about Nebraska?

19:59.597 --> 20:00.596
Oh, hell with Nebraska.

20:00.598 --> 20:02.732
I'm gonna be a star!

20:03.801 --> 20:06.235
== sync, corrected by <font color=#00FF00>elderman</font> ==

20:10.909 --> 20:13.359
Have you ever thought
of teaching physics?

20:23.752 --> 20:25.536
Ready to ride?

20:25.537 --> 20:27.287
I don't think
so, Mom.

20:27.289 --> 20:29.005
Not today.

20:29.007 --> 20:30.257
Oh, sweetie.

20:30.259 --> 20:32.592
Hemorrhoids acting up again?

20:32.594 --> 20:34.744
You don't know the half of it.

20:34.746 --> 20:36.913
Oh, yes, I do.

20:36.915 --> 20:39.382
Try a dab of this.

20:40.918 --> 20:44.804
"Rose-scented
Preparation-H for women?"

20:44.806 --> 20:49.075
Now, the "H" is for "her."

20:52.864 --> 20:54.581
I'm proud of you.

20:54.583 --> 20:55.515
Shh!

20:55.517 --> 20:56.683
Here comes
my joke.

20:56.685 --> 20:58.652
How you doing?

20:58.654 --> 21:02.272
Sittin' pretty.
